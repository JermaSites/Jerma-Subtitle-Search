[04:14.87]I love, okay, here are the terms and phrases that are blocked right now.
[04:18.68]And it reads like a funny story.
[04:20.72]Let me read you the block list in the order that I feel like reading it in.
[04:24.78]How is the gamer going too slow?
[04:28.72]Brain sucks.
[04:30.15]Those are all individual blocked words.
[04:33.13]How is the gamer going too slow?
[04:39.04]Brain sucks.
[04:40.64]Those are all words you cannot say today.
[04:43.85]And I just happen to read them in an order that is an order that I want to make sure it can't be written.
[04:51.61]Mods, just keep, anytime you see somebody talking shit, just add that to the block list.
[04:57.38]Until it's only just like happy, positive energy.
[05:04.44]Positive vibes only.
[05:10.00]Smelly?
[05:10.68]Nah, that doesn't offend me.

[05:33.56]All I'm telling you is your chat experience today is probably going to be a little fucked up.
[05:38.19]So, just be aware of that.
[05:39.55]I know somebody's going to write the word the, get timed out, and they're going to be pissed.
[05:44.13]But just know it's a funny day today, okay?
[05:47.55]It's a funny day.
[05:50.02]Just don't worry.

[05:54.42]Like asymmetrical face?
[05:58.70]Old.
[05:59.71]Well, that's just a factual statement, so.
[06:02.01]I mean, I'm not old.
[06:03.73]No, remove that.
[06:06.13]Remove tiny.
[06:08.29]They'll get a good list going.
[06:11.19]Anyways.
[06:13.24]Haven't seen this in a while, have you?
[06:19.50]I'll be really honest with everybody here.
[06:22.46]I have no idea how to play.
[06:26.61]I have no idea how to play this game anymore.
[06:29.87]It's been like three months.
[06:31.43]What do I do?
[06:36.26]I think I have this marked.
[06:44.41]Where was I even going?
[06:46.11]This is marked?
[06:47.91]Where's the next guardian?
[06:57.78]Just reset.
[06:58.82]I'm not gonna reset?
[07:01.26]Is it here?
[07:01.72]I think- I wouldn't have marked that if it wasn't where I was going.
[07:08.49]We're going there.
[07:15.41]I forgot how to play.
[07:16.13]Okay, I'm good.
[07:18.35]It's B to open the ladder.
[07:21.39]How do I grab a rock?
[07:22.69]How do I grab the side of the- How do I grab- Okay, it's X.
[07:29.08]Why can I not hear this very well?
[07:31.04]There we go.
[07:35.10]You're a noob.
[07:37.56]Put that on the list too.
[07:43.32]Wait.
[07:44.00]No, I remember.
[07:45.28]I got attacked by like lightning and shit.
[07:46.90]I don't think I can go this way.
[07:50.55]I remember.
[07:50.93]Don't forget to tweet.
[07:53.83]Oh shit, you're right.
[07:54.69]Thanks.
[07:56.19]I didn't?
[07:57.87]No, I didn't.
[08:00.27]This tweet sucks.
[08:01.59]Whatever.
[08:02.15]Oh, did I lose my verified status?
[08:04.37]Do you want me to read you the draft tweet?
[08:08.57]That's never getting posted, but it's a draft tweet.
[08:12.03]I had a draft tweet for when I lost verified status.
[08:19.19]It didn't happen yet, so I can't post it because it didn't happen yet.
[08:21.75]So I'm just going to read it to you now and then not post it.
[08:27.80]Okay, so this tweet is... What does it say here?
[08:36.41]Uh... Okay, drafts.
[08:39.41]Okay, this is what I was going to post when I lost verified status.
[08:42.69]It's not even that funny, but I'm going to read it.
[08:46.39]Twitter removed my verified badge?
[08:49.07]How do I stop it?
[08:49.75]Is there a questionnaire I can take?
[08:51.77]Can anyone lend a hand?
[08:53.12]Restarting my router didn't seem to do anything.
[08:55.46]All my speed tests are perfect.
[08:56.72]I don't understand.
[08:59.62]It's pretty... Eh, it's alright.
[09:07.51]It's alright.
[09:13.61]I think the funny part for me for that tweet is all my speed tests are perfect.
[09:18.25]-2 is not blocked.
[09:19.82]Oh.
[09:21.50]Alright.
[09:23.54]Okay.
[09:24.12]Alright.
[09:26.38]Look at that.
[09:33.50]Am I gonna die from this?
[09:35.56]Probably.
[09:40.80]Mods.
[09:41.96]Mods, they're finding a way to get around it.
[09:45.00]Fix it!
[09:45.48]I don't know how to play.
[09:55.88]I don't know how to play the game.
[09:59.09]What did I just do?
[10:00.01]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10:00.85]How to restart the game.
[10:01.77]That was the Moonlight Scimitar?
[10:05.72]What was that?
[10:06.70]Was that a valuable weapon?
[10:09.96]I don't remember how to play.
[10:12.08]Is that bad?
[10:12.78]Should I actually go back?
[10:23.08]I'm going back.
[10:28.90]I have no idea what that was.
[10:30.72]It's a legendary weapon.
[10:38.22]Look at this thing.
[10:38.72]25 damage?
[10:39.46]Are you kidding me?
[10:40.20]I don't want to do that.
[10:43.44]Alright, let's keep going.
[10:45.11]That's where I was going anyways.
[10:46.03]We're good.
[10:48.11]Alright, let me figure... Okay.
[10:50.11]X?
[10:50.63]No, this is Y. Y is attack...
[10:53.70]B is jump.
[10:55.54]A is confirm.
[10:57.90]X is run.
[11:00.12]Left trigger is whatever this is.
[11:02.12]Is this block?
[11:03.71]Okay, that's block.
[11:06.09]Left bumper is camera.
[11:11.43]Oops.
[11:15.38]This one's way better.
[11:20.74]Okay.
[11:21.54]Right bumper is throw weapon.
[11:23.64]Don't do that.
[11:25.45]Right trigger is arrow.
[11:29.37]Up is powers.
[11:32.81]Left is shields.
[11:36.37]Right is swords.
[11:42.00]What?
[11:43.36]Down is horse.
[11:44.86]But I haven't used the horse in like 40 hours of gameplay.
[11:48.04]Alright, let's go.
[11:48.50]I'm ready.
[11:49.78]This is a good skit.
[11:52.10]This is so stupid.
[11:53.10]You spelled it with... S-T-U-V... Money sign T-U-P-1-D.
[12:01.30]It's like you guys are trying to get around the name filter in video games.
[12:09.22]How do I spell fuckface without... Get around the filter?
[12:12.98]Oh, I'll do like... E-E-F... Like F-H-U... Ampersand...
[12:32.40]New voice on log.
[12:40.18]It doesn't spell fuckface.
[12:42.35]E-E-F-H-U ampersand?
[12:45.91]What is that?
[12:46.61]E-F-H-U-A?
[12:50.99]That's... Remove stupid from the fucking void pool.
[12:55.16]Immediately.
[12:56.06]I can see it over here.
[13:05.47]Well, you never heard the word and first hand before?
[13:08.64]Alright, everybody real.
[13:10.00]This was I'm chilling out today.
[13:11.28]Hey, you know what?
[13:14.46]Yeah.
[13:15.76]How's that?
[13:26.01]What's parry?
[13:32.26]How do I make it so it doesn't do this weird globe?
[13:35.29]What has happened?
[13:36.23]I just think this thing's about to break.
[13:42.77]What is happening to my character?
[13:45.77]What is going on?
[13:46.37]Why is this guy like harder than a boss?
[13:56.14]I'm getting hurt too.
[14:00.54]I'm cold?
[14:06.86]I don't think I'm supposed to go this way.
[14:09.12]I'm not... I am not supposed to do what I'm supposed to be doing right now.
[14:13.07]I'm not supposed to be going this way.
[14:17.29]This is not the way you're supposed to go.
[14:19.13]I haven't played the game in three months.
[14:21.88]I don't know what route I was on.
[14:23.44]I'm going this way.
[14:40.75]Do you know what they should make in video games?
[14:43.03]And I know people can be like, oh, here he goes again, but listen to me.
[14:46.89]If the game knows you haven't played in three months, I wish I could watch like a fucking recap video.
[14:53.07]Like a one-minute recap, like... That's in the background.
[15:00.34]We see you haven't played Breath of the Wild in six months.
[15:03.16]Let us give you a quick crash course on everything that's happened and everything you need to know.
[15:17.50]I'm doing this.
[15:22.09]You did your bit, this bit already with Metal Gear Solid.
[15:24.27]There's a whole second YouTube channel that you did this already.
[15:26.47]Do you read the sign?
[15:40.20]Bro, for real, you just skipped the entire oasis.
[15:48.22]So, did I?
[15:49.00]Why are you so mean?
[15:54.38]Alright.
[15:55.84]We will have a little fun today.
[15:58.82]Because I would like for you to bet if I can beat this in 10 minutes.
[16:07.47]And I don't know if I would bet on me right now because I don't even know what the buttons do.
[16:12.51]I don't want you to see.
[16:19.80]After three months, there's no way.
[16:21.54]Well, then, you know what to do.
[16:38.17]I would rather go broke a believer than be rich a doubter.
[16:41.89]Oh, wow.
[16:49.40]That's like really nice.
[16:50.28]That's like actually really sweet of you.
[17:05.59]We believe in you.
[17:06.69]I hate you.
[17:07.39]Yeah, I know.
[17:08.49]All things must be balanced.
[17:16.16]Alright, are we ready?
[17:17.88]In three... I'm looking at... We make sure one of the mods has a clock.
[17:22.15]It's ten minutes.
[17:23.25]Three.
[17:24.51]Two.
[17:25.75]One.
[17:25.89]Go.
[17:30.65]I fuck... I think I give up.
[17:31.83]I don't know if I can do this.
[17:34.44]This looks really complicated.
[17:36.16]I don't just put it down...
[17:46.07]Whoa!
[17:50.97]What?
[17:51.43]Oh.
[17:57.48]How do I safely... Okay.
[17:59.98]Um.
[18:02.92]I need more barrels.
[18:04.34]What the fuck?
[18:21.48]Are there any more barrels?
[18:23.74]What is this?
[18:33.87]That goes over here.
[18:35.77]Which then this connects to here.
[18:37.87]I need way more shit.
[18:39.45]How am I supposed to get up here?
[18:47.60]There's only one barrel in this whole area.
[18:49.68]How am I supposed to do- Whatever-
[18:59.78]Oh, I forgot I had this power.
[19:02.24]Okay, um...
[19:31.16]I need another barrel.
[19:38.41]What if I do this?
[19:40.41]Can I... Wait.
[19:49.32]Everybody wants to help so bad.
[19:51.42]Okay.
[19:52.22]So what does this do?
[19:52.80]Does this count as electricity?
[19:55.66]Can I... This is electricity?
[19:57.00]Oh, this counts as electricity.
[19:58.06]This counts as electricity.
[20:01.51]Shit, another barrel!
[20:03.83]That's not a shit scenario, that's a nice.
[20:06.91]Honestly, R1, I'm so used to... Okay, I got another barrel.
[20:16.49]This is going right here.
[20:29.97]What do we have for time?
[20:31.41]Am I good on time?
[20:42.94]Shit, I gotta replace this.
[20:56.15]Right here?
[20:56.47]Alright.
[21:03.17]Okay.
[21:05.87]Ooh!
[21:10.81]What happened?
[21:13.29]What?
[21:15.39]What is going on?
[21:20.70]What the fuck?
[21:26.62]I walked over the... Now I'm just like...
[21:32.91]Alright, well, come on.
[21:38.60]The timer is still going.
[21:39.88]I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[21:41.26]I'm working on it.
[21:41.72]I'm working on it.
[21:42.30]Why would you ever vote for me right now?
[21:45.50]Like, ever.
[21:46.58]Like, what were you thinking?
[21:48.46]What were you thinking today?
[21:49.56]You really thought this was going to work out?
[21:53.87]I'm surprised.
[21:54.97]What were you thinking?
[22:06.53]What are you doing?
[22:07.55]You're doing the pointing and laughing emote.
[22:11.51]Who cares?
[22:13.42]Stop touching electricity, you fucking moron.
[22:38.51]Alright, we're good.
[22:39.11]I got plenty of time.
[22:40.51]I got six minutes.
[22:46.21]Six minutes is a lot of time.
[22:47.89]The Thunder Blade.
[22:50.23]Oh, God damn it.
[22:59.97]Nice.
[23:01.91]Ooh, this thing's wicked cool.
[23:03.63]This thing is wicked cool.
[23:06.13]I was going to say Rick, like from Rick and Morty.
[23:18.14]It's wicked cool.
[23:19.36]Alright, how do I open that?
[23:23.74]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[23:37.50]Oh, dude, I forgot to tell you guys.
[23:38.96]I turned on the new Space Jam movie.
[23:42.66]And I couldn't follow anything that was going on.
[23:45.24]I actually had no idea what was happening in the movie.
[23:55.42]The first 50 minutes of that movie were just... It reminded me of Kingdom Hearts in a way.
[24:02.55]But Kingdom Hearts just kind of did it way better.
[24:05.67]It was like, oh, hey, look, we're gonna, hey, I just want to let you know that we, there's a character that is cool.
[24:10.77]We're gonna go to their world for 15 minutes.
[24:14.09]And then we're gonna leave.
[24:15.15]And by the way, it's just the fucking Looney Tunes.
[24:18.69]None of the other characters do anything.
[24:19.93]Let's go to the Batman world for like five, fucking five minutes, and that's it.
[24:24.77]Batman's not gonna be in the fucking movie, by the way.
[24:27.31]It's only, it's just the Looney Tunes.
[24:29.37]We're just gonna go visit every world, Kingdom Hearts style, for like five minutes.
[24:33.31]That's the first hour.
[24:33.95]Oh, I gotta play.
[24:51.68]Alright, where's it?
[24:54.86]Right there?
[24:56.28]Oh, shit.
[24:56.76]Hold on.
[24:57.36]Let's see what's in here.
[25:01.70]Dude, don't do this to me right now.
[25:07.37]There's money on the line right now.
[25:10.21]Okay.
[25:11.19]This is connected to here.
[25:13.27]That's already going up there, which I think that just... Hold on.
[25:20.77]Wait, hold on.
[25:21.21]That's going to give me that.
[25:28.01]And then... Wait.
[25:30.65]Oh, fuck.
[25:31.25]How do I... That has to go there.
[25:35.74]Is there another barrel I don't have?
[25:39.98]There must be another barrel or something.
[25:41.22]How do I open this?
[25:46.37]Unless I have to get in here first.
[25:47.69]Hold on.
[25:51.63]Is there another barrel?
[25:54.79]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[26:09.98]No, there's another... Where's there another barrel?
[26:11.50]Do I need another barrel?
[26:15.40]I'm so close, but where's the...
[26:22.24]What do I got for time?
[26:49.21]Get over here.
[26:50.45]Come on!
[26:52.05]Come on, I'm so close!
[27:02.30]Stop!
[27:12.37]What do I got?
[27:12.95]20 seconds, Twi.
[27:13.43]I got 20 seconds.
[27:13.85]20 seconds.
[27:18.78]Oh, everybody eat shit.
[27:20.28]I just did it.
[27:25.87]And time.
[27:32.27]With like five, 10 seconds to spare.
[27:38.85]You had like three seconds left.
[27:40.15]It was frame perfect.
[27:53.77]I mean, I'm... Wait.
[27:56.25]Is it... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[27:58.53]Hold on a second.
[28:01.03]Do we need to review it?
[28:04.55]We need to review the VOD.
[28:05.79]Apparently, it was like one frame is potential away from... It's one frame?
[28:11.20]It was... It may have been off by a frame.
[28:13.70]No.
[28:14.58]What?
[28:16.04]No, it's not.
[28:16.48]Hold on.
[28:16.78]Let me get the VOD.
[28:20.00]Really?
[28:20.26]No way.
[28:21.40]Okay.
[28:24.68]It says 10 minutes exactly, right?
[28:26.44]Hold on, I'll get it.
[28:30.35]Everybody hold for a second.
[28:31.73]Hold on.
[28:37.17]I gotta go.
[28:37.81]The VOD might not have it yet.
[28:39.57]Sometimes it takes a few minutes.
[28:44.11]Okay, recent broadcast.
[28:45.22]Alright.
[28:45.82]Okay.
[28:49.28]Okay.
[28:52.24]Hold on, let me get this on stream.
[28:54.09]This is weird.
[28:54.65]Am I putting the VOD in here?
[28:56.81]Okay.
[29:03.81]Okay.
[29:12.46]Alright, I got the VOD here.
[29:16.40]The question is now, so where was it?
[29:18.52]It's where I say, three, two, one, go, right?
[29:32.67]I got to plug my headphones into another because they're plugged into the... It's over.
[29:37.83]It was 1001.
[29:39.69]It was 10-0-0-0-1.
[29:41.95]What?
[29:43.45]Hold on.
[29:44.19]This is crazy.
[29:47.97]I need to plug this in.
[29:48.67]One sec.
[29:48.91]Okay, hold on.
[30:03.87]Alright, what's the time here?
[30:10.62]Why am I not talking?
[30:12.66]Is there audio on this stream?
[30:16.58]Where's the audio?
[30:17.90]There's no audio.
[30:21.89]Why am I not talking?
[30:23.57]I don't know if I can do this.
[30:26.41]It's the only thing I said?
[30:27.49]What the fuck?
[30:29.92]Alright, hold on.
[30:30.30]Wait, wait, wait.
[30:30.88]Okay.
[30:32.72]Um... Looking at... We may... Looking at... We may... Two.
[30:40.38]One.
[30:41.26]Go.
[30:43.07]Okay.
[30:43.59]It's 1726.
[30:45.05]I forgot I had this power.
[30:51.37]Vote for me.
[30:52.91]Oh, god damn.
[30:55.99]And by the way, Batman's world Kingdom Hearts style for like five years.
[30:59.96]The VOD isn't even caught up yet.
[31:08.46]The VOD isn't even caught up yet, guys.
[31:10.70]We need to wait.
[31:18.06]We have to wait a minute.
[31:21.62]Refresh it?
[31:22.16]Hold on.
[31:26.88]Alright, refreshed.
[31:35.49]Okay, let's go back to where it was.
[31:42.28]There.
[31:43.68]Okay, so we got it.
[31:44.50]So what was it?
[31:45.06]26, right?
[31:50.31]17, 26, 2, 1, go.
[31:50.65]Yep, it's 17, 26.
[31:51.21]Fuck, how do I... Oh, everybody, shit.
[31:55.53]I just did it.
[31:56.49]3, 24, 25, 26.
[32:04.02]No, I don't know.
[32:04.72]I think that counts.
[32:19.08]I just did it.
[32:20.28]Guys, that counts.
[32:21.28]1726.
[32:22.68]How do I do playback speed?
[32:40.85]And... Time.
[32:47.75]I don't... It's because I jumped.
[32:51.19]I jumped, guys.
[32:52.83]I've... My buttons... Do you understand?
[32:56.43]That... I'm telling you right now, I think I count that because... One very important thing... I hit jump instead of accept, because remember, all video games are swapped.
[33:09.00]Right?
[33:09.28]It's like, oh, B is A on Xbox, and A is B, and X is Y, and that's... I don't know.
[33:15.18]Do we count that?
[33:24.35]It really is like one frame.
[33:37.72]I don't know it's it's like it's like a frame or two late.
[33:43.46]Fuck you, you stopped playing and talked about Space Jam for two minutes.
[33:53.03]Does it count?
[33:54.81]I don't know.
[33:55.63]I've never had to deliberate this long on something like this.
[34:01.15]What about walking through the door?
[34:04.03]Honestly, I think walking through the door is the solution.
[34:09.76]That's what I would say.
[34:11.22]Like I walked through the book.
[34:12.76]It's over.
[34:13.36]I win, right?
[34:17.54]It wasn't in 10 minutes.
[34:23.26]I don't have frames for this though.
[34:25.60]Oh, shut up.
[34:26.02]You're annoying.
[34:26.76]Okay.
[34:31.63]I'm gonna do space.
[34:44.88]I think I'm saying it.
[34:46.34]Do you hear that?
[34:48.27]It's... Like, I say time right when it's in 26 still.
[35:00.11]You know what?
[35:00.95]I don't know.
[35:01.43]I don't know what to do.
[35:02.53]I think... But what if it's wrong?
[35:11.05]What the fuck?
[35:11.85]If I just shut up about Space Jam...
[35:26.34]I didn't do it.
[35:26.78]I don't think I did it.
[35:29.36]I don't think I did it.
[35:30.96]Because you know what?
[35:31.80]In Mod Chat, we're talking about this.
[35:34.62]People, in Mod Chat, it's being brought to my attention that in previous times, it was when I accepted the reward.
[35:45.48]It looks like I accepted the reward a tenth of a second too late.
[35:51.43]Because I jumped.
[35:53.57]And it was one full second later I accepted the reward.
[35:59.94]I'm sorry, everybody.
[36:01.78]But we got... I'm sorry, everybody.
[36:04.18]That's the way it works.
[36:07.92]You shouldn't be mad at the frame perfect loss.
[36:10.20]You should be mad at me talking about Space Jam for five minutes.
[36:15.53]Yeah.
[36:17.81]We gotta go by the truth.
[36:20.12]And that was the truth.
[36:24.96]I know.
[36:25.78]I'm so sorry.
[36:26.76]That's the truth.
[36:27.38]We gotta go by the truth.
[36:32.85]Okay.
[36:36.61]Alright.
[36:43.43]Okay.
[36:43.88]Let's go.
[36:48.36]Bugs a bunny can fuck off.
[36:51.02]Bugs a bunny can fuck off.
[36:53.71]What?
[36:53.87]What's going on?
[36:54.71]What?
[36:56.01]What's going on?
[36:56.53]What?
[36:56.81]Wait, what's still open?
[36:58.67]What?
[37:04.85]My stream is not open.
[37:07.51]My stream is not open.
[37:10.20]My stream is not open.
[37:11.78]I'm telling you right now, my stream is not open.
[37:14.36]Oh, okay.
[37:16.00]The banner is playing the stream.
[37:18.12]If you just go to Jerma985, the banner plays it?
[37:20.24]No, it doesn't.
[37:20.64]What the fuck is going on?
[37:22.26]Yeah, the banner is playing the stream.
[37:25.66]What?
[37:27.12]Okay.
[37:27.24]Alright, let's get back to it.
[37:32.34]Sorry, everybody.
[37:40.08]Okay.
[37:41.86]Sorry.
[37:42.20]Oh, sorry.
[37:46.10]I gotta plug this back in.
[37:49.06]Tay Zonday.
[37:49.88]That's a classic.
[37:54.98]Alright, that was cool.
[37:56.21]I got the orb.
[37:59.61]What's up?
[38:03.25]Oh, I was just so focused just now.
[38:04.45]Do you have business with me?
[38:06.35]I don't know.
[38:06.63]What are you doing?
[38:12.57]What?
[38:12.75]No, I'm not a spy.
[38:14.13]I'm a merchant.
[38:14.71]I may not look like it, but I'm actually the leader of a caravan.
[38:18.13]I've traveled all the way here, but this town doesn't allow men to go in, so that's why I had to, um... Are you spying?
[38:24.55]It's research.
[38:25.12]It's research.
[38:25.72]You can think what you want, but I finally found some key info on how to sneak into Gerudo Town.
[38:31.82]Ooh, in-key info.
[38:34.46]Okay.
[38:34.58]This is bright.
[39:03.91]I'm surprised he can read.
[39:05.05]Where is this person?
[39:19.83]They're from the town.
[39:23.57]It said in between the town.
[39:24.75]Okay.
[39:26.61]So this is the road.
[39:27.23]We got to travel on the road.
[39:39.43]No fun allowed?
[39:40.33]There is no fun allowed.
[39:41.49]Not today.
[39:41.85]Why do I not have a horse?
[39:56.47]I have not had a horse the entire playthrough.
[40:04.50]I have to walk this whole way.
[40:08.71]There's gotta be a sta- Frank 2 is right here!
[40:13.25]You're not too far away.
[40:16.12]What?
[40:21.78]Oh, it's too hot for the horse.
[40:23.78]Oh, shit.
[40:24.46]Okay.
[40:28.96]By the way, why am I not on the road?
[40:31.85]There is no road.
[40:38.48]Use your shield.
[40:39.17]Oh, right.
[40:39.53]How do I do that?
[40:42.81]It's like a weird button combination, right?
[40:44.31]Remember what's wrong, babe?
[40:52.22]You've barely touched your rule.
[40:54.42]No, I'm not feeling it today.
[40:56.74]L plus A. There it is.
[40:58.24]Okay.
[41:15.75]Holy shit, that was cool.
[41:18.09]Okay, I don't see anybody.
[41:22.71]Did you?
[41:42.34]Our boss, I get the feeling that he isn't coming back from Gerudo Town anytime soon.
[41:45.10]Hope he's okay.
[41:46.82]Man snuck in.
[41:50.84]What?
[41:51.10]There's a man who got into Gerudo Town?
[41:53.34]And the boss says he comes here to the Karakara Bazaar?
[41:55.86]I guess it must be true if the boss said so.
[41:58.22]I've never seen anyone around here who strikes me as a super sneaky guy.
[42:02.98]It was that pretty Hylian gal at the general store.
[42:06.30]It's unusual to see a Hylian girl dressed like a Gerudo.
[42:09.04]Her Gerudo clothes, I wonder where she bought them.
[42:10.56]Maybe if I wore those clothes.
[42:12.21]Ah, nah.
[42:12.73]I'm so out of my element with all this sneaky stuff.
[42:16.99]Okay.
[42:17.13]What should I use for a weapon?
[42:23.39]What's the shittiest thing that I have?
[42:25.53]Probably this.
[42:30.63]This thing sucks, right?
[42:35.58]Oh, that thing kind of sucks, doesn't it?
[42:49.18]Hmm?
[42:50.04]What's the matter?
[42:50.62]You got this look on your face that almost screams, I gotta talk to you right now.
[42:55.23]Buy my stuff.
[42:59.57]Buy my book.
[43:01.05]Buy my book.
[43:02.57]Buy my book.
[43:04.07]Buy my book.
[43:17.76]Somebody knows what that is.
[43:18.48]Uh, okay.
[43:20.36]I have a lot of junk, but I don't want to sell anything right now.
[43:29.37]Okay.
[43:30.87]Uh... Hi.
[43:37.27]Who are you?
[43:38.07]Uh... You... You're a Vo, aren't you?
[43:42.25]Gotta go!
[43:42.87]I am?
[43:43.07]Why?
[43:45.30]No, I bet Mama would have a problem with a delicate vole like you.
[43:50.95]Oh, yes, I'm Ronson.
[43:53.53]I hail from Gerudo Town.
[43:55.31]The search for the love of my life is so exhausted by it.
[43:57.83]I'm exhausted by it.
[44:00.01]Search.
[44:01.83]Oh, I don't know why I'm even saying this.
[44:03.39]It's no business of a Hylian like you, but I'm constantly being bothered by my mother over not having found the love of my life.
[44:11.22]I wonder if there really is someone out there for me.
[44:14.91]Hmm.
[44:52.50]Okay.
[44:52.76]What is this person doing?
[45:02.63]A treasure hidden inside a sandstorm by an ancient civilization.
[45:06.39]Sounds like an adventure just waiting to happen.
[45:08.55]They say the sandstorm lets up for a few hours each day, but I haven't seen it settle down for even an instant.
[45:16.44]50 merchants?
[45:16.84]Sorry, no idea what you're talking about.
[45:18.10]The only things... Did you fart?
[45:22.10]What?
[45:24.24]No.
[45:29.12]The only things I'm interested in right now are this sandstorm and the treasure hiding inside its storming sands.
[45:33.54]Okay, well... Who are you?
[45:37.70]Okay, so there's a treasure over there?
[45:38.84]Okay.
[45:44.93]Who do I need to talk to?
[45:50.92]Any suspicious vendors?
[45:54.89]From my point of view, pretty much any merchant that is in Gerudo looks suspicious, you realize.
[46:00.21]Still, no, it's my chair squeaking.
[46:05.01]The general store.
[46:05.98]Okay, where's the general store?
[46:10.52]I thought that was a lion.
[46:17.16]Isn't this the general store right here?
[46:24.96]oh maybe this is the general store what do you got
[46:40.37]That divine beast, it feels like it gets a little bit closer every day.
[46:43.56]I wonder how long it'll be before I can get back to Gerudo Town.
[46:46.94]Gerudo Town.
[46:47.38]Okay.
[47:10.63]I know.
[47:11.81]I'll take care of it.
[47:13.39]I got the Divine Beast.
[47:14.19]I got it.
[47:18.40]The sound of the Divine Beast walking might be loud, but the beds are still comfy.
[47:21.78]Do you want to stay?
[47:22.78]No.
[47:30.43]What does this even go to?
[47:39.51]I can't just take that?
[47:40.68]Alright.
[47:41.46]So, is there somebody in here I need to talk to?
[47:42.92]Is it you?
[47:46.72]Oh.
[47:48.64]Um, have you seen a sneaky guy?
[47:51.48]Sneaky what?
[47:51.98]You mean a Vo sneaking around town.
[47:53.64]I haven't seen anyone like that.
[47:55.58]There's a Hylian VI who likes to relax on the roof.
[48:02.05]Though in the afternoon it's probably too hot up there.
[48:03.69]Okay.
[48:07.45]Okay.
[48:10.82]Do I have to sleep or something?
[48:18.48]Climb.
[48:24.98]Climb!
[48:28.74]Climb!
[48:29.24]Stop doing that!
[48:42.61]Somebody's sleeping up here.
[48:45.20]Please don't turn face cam on.
[48:47.00]No, I'm not going to.
[48:47.68]Alright, hi.
[48:55.04]Oh my, what a lovely young lad you are.
[48:56.32]Do you need something from me?
[48:57.10]Um, yes.
[48:59.32]What's that?
[48:59.60]You've heard about a man who snuck into Gerudo Town?
[49:02.24]Oh, I don't know anything about him.
[49:04.12]Sorry, I couldn't be more help.
[49:08.97]Either one of these?
[49:09.59]Squint?
[49:10.98]You're making my cheeks warm looking at me like that.
[49:15.76]Which one of these do I do?
[49:17.34]This one?
[49:19.62]I'm sure you agree that these clothes only help my looks, right?
[49:22.95]Now that I think about it, this style would look quite fetching on you.
[49:25.95]I'd have to charge you, of course, but I bet people would see you completely differently if you wore them.
[49:30.07]What do you think?
[49:30.51]Do you want to buy them for 600 rupees?
[49:32.87]Get the fuck out of here.
[49:41.87]Are you kidding me?
[49:52.37]Oh, my fucking shins.
[49:54.15]Alright, I need to sell something.
[49:59.74]What do I have that's worth anything?
[50:10.60]Alright, scream.
[50:12.32]Scream if I'm going to delete something that's valuable.
[50:15.28]Because I forget there's certain things I can get rid of.
[50:18.87]Like the Amber pieces or something, right?
[50:20.35]Are these valuable?
[50:26.09]What's a thing I can sell?
[50:27.39]It's been three months.
[50:33.19]Sell the parts.
[50:35.57]I have a lot of these, you're right.
[50:40.87]It's not worth that much, though.
[50:43.25]Sell the gems.
[50:46.09]Sell the gems.
[50:46.53]Sell the gems.
[50:48.68]Like this?
[50:49.10]Is this okay?
[50:52.58]How many do I need?
[50:53.12]I have two, twenty... Five?
[50:58.06]Is that okay?
[51:01.89]That's okay, right?
[51:04.35]Just don't sell the luminous ore.
[51:05.67]Okay.
[51:06.13]Okay.
[51:11.87]There's more than that.
[51:21.61]I hope I'm not doing something wrong.
[51:29.04]Alright, let's go.
[51:31.60]Haha, softlocked April Fool's.
[51:43.86]I keep holding X to go faster, but that's not how you do it.
[51:46.10]You have to jump.
[51:49.47]It's okay, you'll find more.
[51:50.81]Yeah, I'll be alright.
[51:57.05]Gems don't have any purpose but just to sell.
[51:59.17]Okay.
[52:03.34]Alright, let's do it.
[52:04.48]Alright, I already did this, right?
[52:15.60]okay six is this I'm not gonna get scammed or something am I it's a lot of money
[52:47.61]E!
[52:48.35]You look adorable.
[52:51.03]Ah, hee hee hee.
[52:51.95]Just as I thought.
[52:52.59]You bake for quite a good looking gal.
[52:54.79]That's a traditional Gerudo outfit.
[52:56.98]It's such a striking look around here.
[52:58.30]I doubt anyone would even suspect that you're a man.
[53:00.72]On top of that, it breathes so well that it's sure to help you deal with the desert heat at least a little.
[53:06.12]So glad I was able to help you out.
[53:08.24]If you're free to grab something to eat sometime, keep me in mind.
[53:15.56]What was that?
[53:18.65]What was that?
[53:21.69]Oh.
[53:25.35]If you want to get more ladies' clothing, come back anytime.
[53:30.93]Okay.
[53:31.37]Alright, let's go.
[53:33.69]Does this have any... Does this have, like, armor?
[53:41.81]Protects from the harsh sun.
[53:45.05]Wait, does this give me heat resistant?
[53:46.79]Ooh, alright, cool.
[53:49.94]Let's go.
[53:50.28]Now I can just get in.
[53:52.05]I can just walk in, right?
[54:03.76]Don't jump in the lava.
[54:06.54]I can teleport?
[54:08.64]Oh, that's right.
[54:09.15]I forgot that was a feature of this video game.
[54:26.40]drip acquired bro forgot about fast travel when you're gonna do a blink cosplay why can't you just cheat millions of rupees in because that's cheating alright so can I just go in
[54:57.66]What's going on over there?
[54:58.58]Alright, I'm going in.
[54:59.66]I can just... I can walk in?
[55:03.60]Hi.
[55:05.46]Okay.
[55:10.08]Boar, strictly forbidden.
[55:11.00]Take your time.
[55:11.86]Okay.
[55:14.10]If you stop by the canteen, do yourself a favor and order a Noble Pursuit.
[55:17.35]It's hands down the best drink I've ever had.
[55:21.37]This is a bright-ass place.
[55:27.28]This area is 95% bloom.
[55:28.90]Okay.
[55:29.38]I already have all this, don't I?
[55:47.85]It's your brightness?
[55:49.59]I don't think it's my brightness.
[56:00.27]I don't have any money to buy anything.
[56:04.29]You can take the outfit off now?
[56:05.99]No, I can't.
[56:16.54]Yes, you can.
[56:17.80]I couldn't... I have to... Hold on.
[56:22.84]There's the Gerudo chief.
[56:26.00]How did you get in here?
[56:32.16]Oh, seems you have something rather interesting there.
[56:44.54]I didn't know they spoke in this game.
[56:45.66]Some of them do.
[56:49.04]Declare your business, but come no closer.
[56:51.20]Hold on, Uliara.
[56:55.02]This one appears to be more than a common traveler.
[56:57.31]You there, what is your name?
[57:01.84]Link.
[57:02.86]And what is it you've come all the way here to tell me?
[57:04.76]I only got one option.
[57:08.19]I can calm Naboris.
[57:09.73]I think you have what it takes to subdue something so powerful as a divine beast.
[57:17.89]The only ones who could ever control them were champions like Lady Urbosa.
[57:23.91]And all of the champions died in the Calamity a hundred years ago.
[57:26.47]Hmm.
[57:29.86]Hmm.
[57:30.72]Buliara, a memory just jumped into my head, something my mother spoke of.
[57:34.24]When the calamity happened, the princess of Hyrule placed a fallen swordsman into a deep sleep.
[57:39.39]That swordsman, much like our new friend here, was named Link.
[57:42.17]Though it always seemed more a legend than fact.
[57:44.79]But Lady Riju, do those same stories not also say that a Hylian champion carried a legendary sword?
[57:50.17]I see no such weapon in this person's care.
[57:53.63]They do indeed, if I recall correctly.
[57:55.62]It was called the Sword that Seals the Darkness.
[57:59.26]Princess of Hyrule supposedly hid it away at every Target in America.
[58:04.08]And every Walmart in America.
[58:10.95]What if the device on this one's hip appears to be a precious relic of the Sheikah?
[58:18.75]I can't imagine it would give something so valuable to a simple drifter, can you?
[58:22.09]I don't remember ever hearing of a Hylian VI among the champions.
[58:29.14]Wait a minute.
[58:30.03]You're a Vo.
[58:30.59]A Vo within our walls is a great crime, but a Vo who is a champion?
[58:35.11]Well, we'd never mistreat a friend of Lady Urbosa.
[58:37.30]And if you're here to help us with Naboris, then we are allies.
[58:41.82]You saw it on your way to our town.
[58:44.49]Divine Beast Va Naboris cloaked in a massive sandstorm hurling lightning at any who dare approach.
[58:51.53]We have to do something to stop it, but we have yet to find any way to appease the Divine Beast on our own.
[58:56.93]If you truly are a champion, perhaps you will be able to enter Naboris and calm its anger.
[59:03.61]Lady Riju.
[59:05.79]Am I saying that right?
[59:07.05]Is it Riju?
[59:09.26]Rihu?
[59:10.02]Riu?
[59:10.54]Am I saying it wrong?
[59:14.45]Is it Reju?
[59:18.39]Reju.
[59:21.62]Reju.
[59:21.90]Okay.
[59:24.42]Perhaps if this person were first to prove his worth by recovering your stolen Thunder Helm.
[59:30.53]Yes, an interesting suggestion.
[59:33.23]You see, there's only one thing in all the Hyrule that can withstand the lightning from Navoris.
[59:39.33]As long as he's not streaming on Twitch, he's not a streamer, it'll take less than probably 30 minutes.
[59:43.99]But if he is a streamer, then we're fucked for at least like six hours.
[60:01.46]You can't even -2.
[60:02.26]Don't worry.
[60:02.60]I got it covered.
[60:04.34]Our soldiers can tell you all you need to know about the thieves that stole Lady Ruju's heirloom.
[60:08.71]Head through this arch.
[60:10.93]It will lead you to the barracks.
[60:12.25]Then seek out Captain Teak and ask for a full report.
[60:18.49]Without my heirloom, you'll never be able to approach Naboris.
[60:20.95]Okay, so I have to get that.
[60:21.92]Okay.
[60:30.30]Where are the gems?
[60:46.67]What are you doing in here?
[60:47.39]This is the barracks for the chief's guards, not a place for tourists to gather.
[60:51.61]We're on high alert after the recent theft, so you should clear out.
[60:56.91]Turn down the brightness.
[60:59.99]I don't... Did I fuck it up?
[61:03.19]Hold on a second.
[61:05.87]My apologies, I'm the officer in charge of the soldiers, Captain T. The chief's heirloom was stolen by thieves belonging to the Yiga clan the other day, so everyone is on edge.
[61:15.27]We've determined that the Yiga's hideout is in Karusa Valley.
[61:20.07]The soldiers are all exhausted, so I was just thinking about requesting some extra help.
[61:26.66]Listen up.
[61:27.54]This Hylian VI has agreed to help us, so offer her any information you can.
[61:33.83]Consider yourself a part of our unit.
[61:34.92]If you have any questions, my troops would be happy to help.
[61:39.08]Is it bright?
[61:39.74]I don't think I can even do that.
[61:48.42]Turn up the brightness.
[61:55.83]Wait, hold on.
[62:02.31]There's not, like, gamma on this or something that I have turned up.
[62:05.77]No, there's not.
[62:08.51]I think that's just how it is, guys.
[62:13.88]Got you, April Fools.
[62:17.76]Getting real fucking sick of putting this up.
[62:30.68]Okay, let's go.
[62:43.17]I don't have any money, but... Okay.
[62:48.35]So this is the Divine Beast.
[62:49.59]So I need to get... Where's the helm?
[62:50.69]They said what?
[62:51.63]Some town or valley or something?
[63:09.44]Over here.
[63:09.72]Okay.
[63:11.01]Okay.
[63:14.04]So I gotta go over here.
[63:18.82]Check your quests.
[63:21.12]Ah, okay.
[63:27.29]No.
[63:40.32]I think I just have to go up there.
[63:44.03]go that way.
[63:54.15]Oh, you're highly invited.
[63:55.96]We don't see too many of you.
[63:56.98]I can't tell how old you are, but you look a little young to be coming to my shop.
[64:00.54]We make special drinks here.
[64:01.72]Drinks that are definitely just for adults.
[64:05.76]How old is Link?
[64:10.55]Our featured cocktail is called Noble Pursuit.
[64:12.61]Many of our customers come here specifically to order it.
[64:16.73]A light, sweet taste.
[64:17.85]The cool sensation from each sip.
[64:19.01]It's like drinking distilled motivation.
[64:20.77]Okay.
[64:32.21]So I can't drink it?
[64:40.40]Link is 17.
[64:40.84]Okay.
[64:41.22]He's 117.
[64:42.76]What?
[64:43.06]He slept for 100 years.
[64:53.03]Huh?
[64:53.11]Huh?
[64:53.27]Huh?
[65:13.35]He was very tired.
[65:25.23]It was at the start of the game.
[65:26.27]That was four months ago.
[65:27.48]I don't remember that.
[65:28.70]I feel like I've been asleep for a hundred years.
[65:34.98]Okay, so I think I'm just gonna go up here.
[65:41.20]But I don't have like a place to go.
[65:44.49]Was it actually in the quest log?
[65:46.23]I don't see it anywhere.
[65:46.99]Oh, I have to talk to everybody.
[66:00.47]Okay.
[66:06.59]Okay.
[66:09.29]The yellow circle on the map?
[66:10.43]Yeah, that's really far up.
[66:14.45]What are you doing in here?
[66:16.05]I'm an archaeologist of sorts.
[66:17.67]I was just poring over some ancient text that I discovered the other day.
[66:22.98]And I finally decoded it.
[66:24.44]Well, part of it at least, but the rest is not far off.
[66:27.34]With this discovery, I'll finally be able to make a name for myself as an archaeologist.
[66:31.36]Of course.
[66:33.14]You and I meeting here is no coincidence.
[66:35.04]I've never been one to question fate.
[66:38.29]I can't explain why, but I trust you for some reason.
[66:40.57]I'll tell you the details of my research.
[66:43.13]Let's hear it.
[66:44.91]There's a temple east of here near the entrance to the Gerudo desert.
[66:48.94]It's dedicated to the seven giant statues of the heroines said to be the divine protectors of Gerudo.
[66:56.68]Is that this temple that I originally discovered in the ancient scripture?
[66:58.48]It reads, when the symbols of the seven find their place, the blessed path will be revealed.
[67:03.69]That's all I've been able to get.
[67:05.17]You know what I mean?
[67:06.13]I'm going way too fast.
[67:07.19]It's believed that people once came from around the world in search of the heroines' blessings.
[67:13.77]But as far as I can tell, it doesn't appear that anyone has found it yet.
[67:16.25]Okay.
[67:20.27]I'm not sure what exactly it means, but maybe I'll find out once I've deciphered more of the text.
[67:26.09]Not sure if this is related, but it said that heroines held powers that were part of a bigger whole.
[67:32.55]Each heroine had a different power, skill, spirit, endurance, knowledge, flight, motion, and gentleness.
[67:42.69]Interesting.
[67:43.80]But they all look the same to me.
[67:46.44]I should understand the entire script before long, but that's only the beginning of my problems.
[67:53.24]That divine beast has been moving around the area, making it harder for me to conduct my research.
[67:57.43]There's no respect for academia.
[67:58.89]Hmm.
[68:05.71]What would my... Because, wait, there's the seven deadly sins, and then there's the seven deadly virtues, or whatever it is, right?
[68:13.52]There's an opposite.
[68:15.04]What are the virtues?
[68:15.68]A lot of people don't know that.
[68:17.62]There are seven virtues.
[68:18.92]And there are seven sins.
[68:20.38]Everyone's like, oh, you know, envy, lust, pride, greed.
[68:24.18]Nobody ever talks about the virtues.
[68:27.22]The seven heavenly virtues.
[68:29.38]It's charity.
[68:31.80]Um... Charity, humility.
[68:37.77]What are they?
[68:38.83]Humility, charity...
[68:42.68]Humility, Charity, Chastity, Gratitude, Temperance, Patience, and Diligence.
[68:51.70]Those are the seven virtues versus the seven sins.
[69:02.45]Yeah.
[69:04.66]All we ever hear about is like, oh, greed and envy.
[69:07.50]I want to hear more about fucking temperance.
[69:10.12]What's temperance's deal?
[69:16.11]Okay, so let's talk.
[69:28.36]Go play Binding of Isaac, then.
[69:29.70]Okay.
[69:37.68]Are you serious?
[69:38.46]Why did you let her go by herself?
[69:39.54]I apologize.
[69:42.71]She said she just wanted to check it out.
[69:43.81]Hmm.
[69:46.45]Ooh, as if we aren't busy enough searching for the chief's heirloom.
[69:49.31]Now we have to find Barta, too.
[69:51.65]If the captain hears about this fiasco, she'll punish us for sure.
[69:54.23]Probably a hundred laps around Gerudo Desert again.
[69:58.88]Catholic Andy.
[70:05.02]I'm just saying, everyone always does a bunch of shit about the seven deadly sins, but we never hear about fucking chastity.
[70:11.92]We never hear about... Um...
[70:15.70]Harmony, whatever the other one is.
[70:18.58]We never hear about... Charity, yeah.
[70:27.62]It's chastity.
[70:28.70]What is... Hold on a second.
[70:30.06]Why is everybody freaking out about this?
[70:38.70]The state or practice of refraining from extramarital or especially from all sexual intercourse Chastity is no sex
[71:09.63]The virtues.
[71:16.37]Most virtuous of all streamers.
[71:23.30]Yeah, what am I talking about?
[71:24.20]I'm sitting here going like, no, we keep hearing about greed and lust.
[71:27.60]I want to hear more about no sexual intercourse.
[71:30.22]I want to hear about no sex, no alcohol, no drugs.
[71:33.80]I also want to hear about being polite to, I want to be, where's politeness?
[71:50.92]What are the other ones?
[71:51.68]Hold on.
[71:52.16]I need to break this down.
[71:53.84]The seven virtues.
[71:58.30]Humility?
[71:59.00]Okay.
[71:59.59]Humility.
[72:00.55]I think everybody could do with a little bit of humility, right?
[72:05.65]What's wrong with that?
[72:06.35]Charity?
[72:07.05]What's wrong with that?
[72:08.29]Gratitude?
[72:08.97]I think people, you know, being gratitude, being thankful and... Patience?
[72:17.14]That's a really big one.
[72:18.20]Patience is a huge one.
[72:21.51]Diligence.
[72:22.59]That's a big one.
[72:23.82]Temperance.
[72:25.40]Let me look this up before.
[72:26.54]Temperance doesn't mean like sex or anything, right?
[72:32.12]Temperance is the moderation in action, thought, or feeling.
[72:36.32]Restraint.
[72:37.14]Moderation in the indulgence or passions.
[72:41.27]I would be temperance.
[72:45.17]We got fucking... We got... We got...
[72:52.59]The most virtuous of all the virtues.
[72:54.80]Temperance.
[72:58.82]All things in moderation.
[73:09.33]That's so stupid.
[73:19.17]Temperance Andy.
[73:26.71]The only thing I knew about temperance was it spawned the blood donation machine in Isaac.
[73:31.55]That's it.
[73:32.87]That's the only thing I knew.
[73:34.71]Alright, these guys are fucking horrible.
[73:45.79]These guys have got a lot of health.
[73:55.74]This thing breaks.
[73:57.30]Okay.
[74:03.30]Oh, yeah.
[74:03.48]It's jump over or jump to the side.
[74:05.26]Right.
[74:05.46]I'm going to jump over it.
[74:07.03]Do the big flurry.
[74:08.05]It didn't count?
[74:12.87]Oh, dude.
[74:13.31]Don't even.
[74:15.75]What the fuck?
[74:17.05]What are you... I don't have any food.
[74:28.41]Kind of.
[74:32.77]Stealth boost.
[74:37.27]Ooh, I'll eat this.
[74:50.11]Oh my god, I hate this enemy.
[74:51.78]They just do a gigantic AOE that you can't get away from.
[74:58.17]Everyone's so much faster than me.
[74:59.36]I'm just running.
[75:07.82]You won.
[75:08.42]I'm... I lost.
[75:09.62]I'm... Are you kidding me?
[75:14.47]What is going on with these enemies?
[75:15.69]Why are they like tuned up times a hundred fucking million?
[75:18.39]What?
[75:29.47]I'm not even going that way.
[75:32.71]You have no armor on?
[75:35.64]Oh, shit.
[75:36.44]I had armor on last time and still did the same thing.
[75:55.34]I'm reading modchat.
[75:56.80]I did know what that is.
[75:59.02]I've heard that before.
[75:59.96]I just... I thought it meant something else... too.
[76:18.07]What the fuck did you think it meant?
[76:34.67]There's no way I'm going to climb that.
[76:42.97]What's going on over here?
[76:47.34]No temperance.
[76:56.28]Yeah, I'm showing a lot of temperance right now.
[76:58.54]Why not?
[77:00.87]Fucking banning like 4000 of you from chat.
[77:10.61]Can I launch this?
[77:12.21]That's patience, not temperance.
[77:18.54]Oh.
[77:18.94]Well, temperance is restraint.
[77:20.76]Restraint, moderation.
[77:30.29]It's gonna go the correct way.
[77:38.31]This dude is a heretic.
[77:43.54]You have to balance the virtues with the sins.
[77:58.33]There was one time that Holly and I
[78:01.55]were eating and watching TV, and we were watching a video of somebody eating a bunch of food.
[78:07.08]It was one of those, like, oh, look, eat videos.
[78:09.32]I forget which one it was, what we were even fucking watching.
[78:12.89]But we were eating a pie together.
[78:16.79]Yeah, a mukbang, yeah.
[78:19.12]We were eating a pie.
[78:21.88]And it was a banana cream pie, and we were just eating out of the tin together.
[78:25.58]And I remember I was pointing at the screen, going, this is, this is sin.
[78:30.80]This is sin right here.
[78:32.73]And we're eating a fucking pie out of the tin together.
[78:37.87]It was like, what, what am I talking about?
[78:39.63]I was going, this is sin.
[78:42.99]This is sin right here.
[78:45.63]And I had a mouthful of whipped cream and banana cream, and I was shoveling it into my mouth on the fucking couch.
[78:52.16]And she started laughing her ass off.
[78:54.14]I'm just like, what?
[78:55.12]She's like, this is sin.
[78:59.02]Looking into a mirror.
[79:00.10]No, you don't understand.
[79:02.79]This is sin.
[79:05.55]This is delicious banana cream pie, by the way, honey.
[79:08.95]Ooh, yeah, I'll take another spoonful full of my fillet.
[79:27.30]It was just such, it was such a hypocrite.
[79:31.05]Why did that scare the shit out of me?
[79:35.79]Is here a ghost?
[79:37.02]What's wrong with Link?
[79:39.26]Can I make it up here?
[80:03.83]No, I didn't start saying... Okay, no, no, no, no, no.
[80:06.59]I think people... Let me give some more context.
[80:11.75]I didn't start by chanting that.
[80:14.65]We had watched like five of them in a row.
[80:18.58]Sitting there eating this pie.
[80:20.38]And at some point during this pie eating, watching mukbangs is when I just started pointing at the screen saying it.
[80:28.55]I don't know.
[80:30.15]I think people just don't... People underestimate how much media I consume all the time.
[80:35.17]I watch a lot of shit.
[80:36.51]I watch tons of streamers and YouTube channels and TV shows.
[80:41.30]I just don't really talk about it.
[80:48.52]Oh, yes.
[80:53.82]Bro, where am I going?
[80:58.78]I could have just teleported over here.
[81:00.26]I thought you didn't watch much movie or TVs.
[81:18.20]Years ago, that was the case.
[81:20.32]I want to say the last, the last like six to 12 months, we've been watching a lot of media.
[81:27.98]I'm just hanging out on the couch.
[81:31.83]I am catching up with almost a decade of TV I've not watched.
[81:36.17]So think about how awesome the position I'm in is.
[81:41.24]Think of all the TV shows that have been huge.
[81:43.52]All the... All the animes that you keep telling me to watch that I've not seen a single episode of that is queued up.
[81:49.06]I got Better Call Saul.
[81:50.70]I got... I made... This... I forgot how to play the game.
[81:56.77]God damn it.
[81:57.33]I hate when this happens.
[81:59.47]Oh my god.
[82:00.55]What is going on right now?
[82:01.55]I think I'm screwed here.
[82:07.99]Let's teleport again.
[82:08.71]Good call.
[82:19.34]There's so much TV.
[82:20.18]There's so much movie.
[82:20.82]All the movies too.
[82:23.01]Oh, you know what we saw recently as well?
[82:25.25]We saw the new Puss in Boots.
[82:28.35]That was really cool.
[82:39.16]That was a really just nice movie.
[82:41.43]It was a really nice movie.
[82:45.47]Okay, I'm gonna go this way.
[82:46.77]I think this is the correct way to go to get up there.
[82:52.74]It was very good.
[82:56.67]So, um, I don't want to speak completely out of my ass because I don't know who was, you know, animation director on that movie.
[83:04.94]But I really like this new trend of animated movies, especially with action sequences, dropping their frame rates down a little.
[83:12.20]It's almost like that low frame rate feeling where... Hold on.
[83:18.39]Oh, this again.
[83:20.91]Into the Spider-Verse did that.
[83:23.43]Where each frame was almost deliberate.
[83:30.45]I really love that style a lot.
[83:35.63]It's kind of like comic-y.
[83:36.62]Yeah.
[83:39.54]I don't like the high frame rate shit.
[83:41.08]I, you know, anti-technology Andy.
[83:44.24]That's fine.
[83:45.68]A 60 FPS, like a full like movie shot in like 48 FPS and on those like plasma screen TVs where it's like 500 Hertz.
[83:57.80]It's just a movie now.
[83:59.90]It's a movie now.
[84:01.36]It's not... I can't suspend my disbelief that much anymore.
[84:04.06]I remember watching... I think it was one of the Lord of the Rings in 48... I think maybe it was The Hobbit or something.
[84:13.87]And it was in 48... 144 hertz, 240 hertz or something.
[84:18.06]And it was just... I felt like somebody was videotaping it with a camcorder.
[84:22.30]They were actors on the screen.
[84:23.74]It wasn't a movie anymore.
[84:32.27]Now you wanna go?
[84:32.83]It's the soap opera effect.
[84:37.37]Exactly, exactly.
[84:50.51]Stop!
[84:54.17]Oh my goodness, what did I just spawn?
[84:57.89]Look at all those gems.
[85:07.79]Alright, goodbye.
[85:12.91]Frame rate really only matters for games.
[85:19.41]I miss like 16 millimeter too.
[85:21.71]I know I'm an old person.
[85:25.17]But though a lot of movies that are filmed in 16 and 30 millimeter film, they act, they feel different.
[85:30.33]They hit way differently.
[85:31.43]A lot of people here.
[85:41.02]Why even fight them?
[85:46.42]Alright.
[85:54.49]Don't kill me, please.
[85:57.95]These drop a lot of money.
[85:59.99]Holy shit.
[86:02.91]Okay.
[86:07.97]What's this?
[86:09.75]The duplex bow.
[86:13.74]Fire two arrows at once.
[86:16.94]Ooh.
[86:21.66]How do I change my bow?
[86:25.37]It has to be out first.
[86:26.23]Okay.
[86:27.33]This thing's almost broken, so I'm just going to get rid of it.
[86:37.44]Cool.
[86:46.57]Now what?
[86:51.19]Torch?
[86:54.03]Is this some puzzle bullshit?
[86:59.39]This is some puzzle bullshit, isn't it?
[87:14.26]I can't even carry anything.
[87:15.68]I have to get rid of this.
[87:19.12]Because it's going to want me to walk around with the torch.
[87:21.50]I'm going to light the torch here.
[87:22.60]Yep, okay.
[87:26.25]What the hell do you want me to do?
[87:28.85]Be more positive?
[87:30.53]Oh, sure, actually.
[87:38.05]So even if I don't know where I'm going, I think it's fine.
[87:40.45]I should be fine.
[87:41.03]It takes a little longer, but that's okay.
[87:42.18]Okay.
[87:45.74]This door has fire on it.
[87:48.04]I'm imagining it has something to do with my flame in my hand.
[87:54.38]Hmm.
[87:56.02]Oh, I can go this way.
[87:58.02]That's where I came from.
[87:59.74]It's okay to check, though.
[88:05.16]Hmm.
[88:07.22]Maybe I burn the door?
[88:10.20]Really good.
[88:10.84]That was a good idea.
[88:11.77]I just had a really good idea.
[88:15.58]I'm not going to hurt them.
[88:18.80]Nothing over here.
[88:20.22]It's okay.
[88:21.26]It was worth a try.
[88:21.90]Get the fuck away from me.
[88:32.50]You little monsters.
[88:35.62]Let me try doing this.
[88:37.47]Ooh, I can move these.
[88:38.35]Maybe I should burn them.
[88:45.02]Customer service.
[88:51.40]Oh, that's another... Okay.
[88:52.74]You know what else I've seen a little bit of?
[88:55.56]We've watched some of the old Jackie Chan movies.
[88:59.75]Have any of you ever seen Drunken Master?
[89:03.85]Holy shit.
[89:06.09]Those movies are fucking unbelievable.
[89:12.61]The old police story movies...
[89:16.02]Wow.
[89:18.50]If you've never seen Police Story, if you've never seen Drunken Master 1 and 2, please, please, for the love of God, within the next two or three days, go watch them.
[89:31.60]The amount of skill and the amount of dedication that they did in those movies, they were fucking unbelievable.
[89:40.08]It's required reading for the stream now.
[89:44.45]Gremlins 2 is on there.
[89:46.61]Drunken Master 2 is on there too.
[89:49.39]Are you okay?
[89:50.03]Yeah, I'm good.
[89:50.99]Are you?
[89:56.46]Which ones?
[89:56.94]Police Story.
[89:59.08]And then... Drunken Master.
[90:03.20]Jackie Chan is gone.
[90:04.62]The old catalog of the old 80s and 90s movies.
[90:06.58]Just go watch them all.
[90:08.10]I promise you won't be disappointed.
[90:10.94]They're just outrageous with how talented and the martial arts are just... They don't make them like that anymore.
[90:17.86]And I will say that.
[90:18.60]They don't make them like that anymore.
[90:21.70]They really don't.
[90:23.60]Go ahead.
[90:24.18]Say it.
[90:24.90]Go ahead.
[90:26.36]They don't... BatChest me.
[90:27.44]Go ahead.
[90:27.84]They don't make them like that anymore.
[90:32.88]John Wick?
[90:33.64]Yeah.
[90:35.89]John Wick is... John Wick is good.
[90:38.19]John Wick is very good.
[90:41.39]But I still don't think... I still think the old Jackie Chan movies are better.
[90:46.12]I do.
[90:49.42]John Wick is awesome.
[90:51.34]But I still think that those old Jackie Chan movies are... are just... they're the greatest of all time.
[91:01.07]Yeah, and it's like it's kind of unfair to compare them anyways.
[91:14.54]What was even in this chest?
[91:15.92]I don't know.
[91:23.28]I'm just picking stuff up and putting it down now.
[91:25.99]It was money?
[91:26.37]Okay, good.
[91:32.41]I actually bat-chested during one of the... I think it was the third.
[91:39.07]The third John Wick movie, I actually was bat-chesting.
[91:41.48]I was like, what the fuck?
[91:42.90]Whoa!
[91:43.26]Whoa!
[91:46.22]Oh yeah.
[91:47.64]During Drunken Master, I couldn't even have an emotion.
[91:51.36]It was just, my eyes were just glued to the screen.
[91:53.96]I didn't even have time to BatChest.
[91:55.36]It was like, what the fuck?
[91:56.58]This is unbelievable.
[91:59.34]My jaw can't even go down.
[92:00.62]Ooh.
[92:19.79]You know what a really big difference between John Wick and the old Jackie Chan movies are?
[92:27.90]Not a lot of firearms.
[92:30.24]The use of, like, guns.
[92:31.68]It was mostly martial arts.
[92:37.44]Okay, so what am I doing here?
[92:42.50]And some of the shit they pull off in John Wick with the firearms is crazy, right?
[92:47.52]It's hard to compare them.
[92:56.79]Do I just break these?
[93:01.63]Take.
[93:02.71]Can I not push these out of the way?
[93:06.48]Vicious sickle.
[93:17.86]I have... That's right.
[93:19.88]I have bombs.
[93:20.83]I thought it's been too long.
[93:22.71]Hmm.
[93:44.18]What's going on here?
[93:52.43]Oh, I didn't get this one.
[93:59.62]I don't want to break it, but I want to drop it.
[94:09.79]I hear some sparklies.
[94:16.09]Oh, it's that.
[94:22.89]Yeah, I've seen Kung Fu Hustle.
[94:24.69]Kung Fu Hustle is awesome too.
[94:39.45]What made you want to hop on Zelda again?
[94:42.27]Immense peer pressure by 30,000 to 40,000 people.
[94:46.47]Wait, what's going on?
[94:58.94]Ooh.
[95:02.90]You mean to tell me I opened up every single one of them and the last one I opened was the right one?
[95:18.00]I'm sitting here looking for a puzzle.
[95:19.24]Alright, let me eat some of these bananas.
[95:33.33]I need to... I didn't cook.
[95:34.32]I forgot to cook.
[95:35.10]Uh-oh.
[95:36.30]I hope there's nothing that dangerous in here.
[95:43.50]Oh, shit.
[95:43.86]Someone's in there.
[95:46.14]What are you doing here?
[95:46.62]This is the hideout of those Yiga thieves who stole the Thunderhelm.
[95:51.34]If they spot you, they'll call their friends for sure.
[95:53.02]There's no way you can take them all on.
[95:54.50]If only you had some way of distracting them, but I don't know how.
[95:58.34]All I ever see them do is patrol and eat bananas.
[96:01.05]I haven't seen anything else that you could exploit as a weakness.
[96:04.01]Poison the bananas.
[96:08.13]Poison the bananas.
[96:08.77]I played enough Hitman.
[96:18.44]I don't know what weapon to use.
[96:33.96]They all seem too good.
[96:39.80]What do I use?
[96:42.25]I don't know what to do.
[96:43.05]Oh, you have emote only ma- oh no.
[96:46.12]But I don't want to break a- a good weapon.
[96:50.54]Whatever, I'm gonna use this.
[96:54.39]No, I'm not.
[96:54.93]I'm gonna use- I'm just gonna use the torch.
[97:52.89]It's not an instant kill.
[97:53.71]I just wanted the treasure.
[98:01.70]Just give me the chest.
[98:04.40]What's in it?
[98:06.10]Ooh, a sharefire.
[98:14.64]Oh my god, this banana's right there.
[98:15.86]I know what to do.
[98:16.28]I know what to do.
[98:32.60]I know what to do.
[98:39.65]Alright, so I have to shoot the bananas down.
[98:51.60]They probably go for the bananas?
[99:04.90]Alright, so bananas are on this side over there.
[99:07.65]Look at the bananas.
[99:15.52]What are you doing?
[99:18.86]I'll take them if you don't.
[99:26.09]Open the... What are you doing?
[99:27.43]Oh, the...
[99:42.28]You're gonna eat the banana?
[99:42.96]Do they hear this sound?
[99:51.25]Alright, this sound.
[99:52.57]Dude, what the?
[100:13.76]I'm doing this, because fuck this place.
[100:15.76]Oh my god, never mind.
[100:28.10]What?
[100:29.39]You see the banana?
[100:44.55]Get the fuck out of here!
[100:46.43]Get out of here!
[100:47.17]Oh fuck!
[101:13.27]Oh shit!
[101:18.41]Are you coming over here?
[101:19.03]Are there any more bananas?
[102:15.16]Oh my god, what the fuck is going on here?
[102:32.61]Forced stealth missions?
[102:34.21]Drop every game a full letter grade.
[102:36.77]That's the rule, I didn't make it.
[102:47.50]I just follow the rule.
[102:56.30]So it's a good thing that, uh, Breath of the Wild started at an 11.
[103:02.72]What just happened?
[103:10.12]Hey, can you help me?
[103:11.04]I don't know what I did, but there's, like, people fighting me.
[103:15.44]Open that up.
[103:15.96]Let me in there.
[103:19.85]OK, so bananas.
[103:28.39]Will you just stop playing?
[103:29.67]Stop playing around and kill me already.
[103:32.31]Stop messing around and get get the job done.
[103:36.58]You're messing around.
[103:37.68]Thank you.
[103:46.16]OK.
[103:48.18]So bananas.
[103:50.81]I have a lot of them.
[103:52.12]Can I throw them?
[103:53.46]Can I just... Can I put them on the ground?
[103:57.02]Does that work?
[104:04.24]Hold.
[104:05.97]It does work.
[104:08.89]Okay.
[104:11.41]That fixes a lot of things.
[104:25.81]So this one should be... I just need to have patience.
[104:27.88]Come on.
[104:28.42]I gotta do one of the virtues.
[104:36.36]Prove that I'm a virtuous streamer.
[104:40.06]Patience.
[104:41.68]Temperance.
[104:49.65]Shut up.
[104:51.05]That's lame.
[105:02.25]I'm telling you, there's one thing a gamer doesn't want to hear in a game.
[105:05.89]It's this.
[105:12.77]Nobody wants to hear that.
[105:15.55]Oh, nobody wants to hear that in any game.
[105:21.51]Where'd they go?
[105:21.95]Okay, alright.
[105:23.68]I don't want to waste the bananas.
[105:49.60]Bananas just dropped next to you.
[105:53.20]Bananas are next to you.
[105:55.22]How did you not want to eat those?
[106:06.98]If I kill them, does it just... Can I just skip this whole section if everybody here dies?
[106:16.30]Yeah?
[106:18.12]Alright, let's go.
[106:20.51]I'm taking out the fucking Royal Claymore for this one.
[106:26.81]No, I'm not.
[106:29.90]I'll use this.
[106:30.32]I don't... Why does... Where am I?
[106:42.29]I...
[107:10.71]Okay.
[107:12.63]Cool.
[107:16.07]Just hold five of them.
[107:17.99]I'm just gonna throw a handful of these on the fucking ground.
[107:22.38]Look what I got!
[107:23.68]I came to the potluck!
[107:27.00]Here, look what I- look at this!
[107:38.47]Okay, I'm sorry.
[107:40.63]I'm sorry.
[107:41.33]I'm sorry.
[107:42.01]I could have killed him if I didn't have the fucking torch equipped.
[107:50.75]I'll do it for real this time.
[107:51.85]This part sucks.
[108:10.48]I'm glad my face cam isn't on.
[108:11.58]Actually, let's turn it on for a second so you can see probably how red I am.
[108:32.56]oh my god I hate this so I just want to play the game I hate like oh wait wait a second wait hold on wait for them to walk around the corner oh I hate these in games
[108:59.64]Oops.
[109:42.70]Shit.
[109:43.04]That's the fastest way to die.
[109:53.28]Go get out of here.
[110:05.09]I'm never going to be able to do this.
[110:06.83]This is going to be worse than the forest.
[110:07.99]Bro, I didn't even pick up the bananas.
[110:12.65]I'm so flustered right now.
[110:19.71]Did I?
[110:20.17]I'm so flustered.
[110:20.85]I didn't even realize that I did pick up the bananas and I got mad because I didn't think I'd picked up the bananas, but I already picked them up.
[110:26.01]That's next level tilted.
[110:27.07]Alright, just wait.
[110:30.75]Let's just sit here for 25 minutes while he walks around.
[110:37.47]Thank you.
[111:15.40]Go get it.
[111:15.80]Okay, back here again.
[111:36.21]How did that miss?
[111:45.12]I want to get that, but I don't even care.
[111:48.97]Why does he not see it?
[112:00.22]Banana's right next to you.
[112:10.22]What's going on?
[112:10.63]Is it bugged?
[112:12.61]What's happening here?
[112:43.90]Are you gonna see it now?
[112:44.60]That was dumb.
[112:56.74]Did this guy see me?
[112:58.14]What the fuck is happening in this video game right now?
[113:29.02]I'm going to use the Royal Claymore.
[113:32.34]I'm not fucking around anymore.
[113:39.10]Holy shit, that's the absolute.
[113:42.19]I got their whole stash.
[113:45.75]Oh my goodness gracious.
[113:49.67]Can you guys help me here?
[113:50.91]Am I missing an item or something?
[113:52.87]Because this seems impossible.
[114:03.41]No?
[114:06.40]My armor is loud.
[114:35.97]I feel like I'm making the same amount of sounds I were earlier.
[114:38.47]I'm looking at the sound meter.
[114:44.59]The purple line?
[114:45.35]That's still bad.
[114:49.47]Weapons 2?
[115:00.66]I don't think that's doing anything.
[115:18.56]Alright, so what the hell happened here?
[115:20.54]It doesn't really sense.
[115:26.13]Here's your banana.
[115:29.06]Go get it!
[115:30.82]Why are you looking at me?
[116:00.32]Is somebody going to see me up here?
[116:01.72]I hope not.
[116:17.40]Got your whole stash.
[116:18.24]Fuck all of you.
[116:30.22]Yeah, now watch this.
[116:30.94]Okay, where do I need to go?
[116:39.68]That's where I died.
[116:42.90]I gotta go across that way, right?
[116:45.21]This is gonna be a really ballsy move.
[117:04.07]What are you fucking talking about?
[117:05.89]Get up there!
[117:09.07]No!
[117:10.73]Why didn't I jump?
[117:11.55]Why didn't I go up?
[117:13.09]What?
[117:16.96]Are you fucking shitting me?
[117:19.28]Why couldn't I climb over that?
[117:21.74]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[117:47.30]Why couldn't I climb up the lip?
[117:49.26]It's not like it was any different than any other lip in this whole game so far.
[117:53.62]What is this shit area?
[117:54.68]Why did you make me come here?
[118:21.10]This sucks.
[118:47.40]The sounds and shit too, they can hear you, they can see you, they can see you from across the whole fucking map.
[118:53.45]This motherfucker right here sees me every time I shoot the banana down on the right side, which is, in my brain, it's, hey, go look, there's a banana over there.
[119:00.83]He don't care.
[119:01.57]He doesn't care.
[119:02.65]Huh?
[119:22.79]What's this guy's deal?
[119:24.73]Why won't he go to the banana?
[119:27.45]It's right there, dude.
[119:35.20]Go get that banana.
[119:36.40]No, no, no, no.
[119:40.48]Do not put a bomb down.
[119:42.03]Whatever you do, please don't put the bomb down.
[119:47.55]Oh, fuck.
[119:47.87]I have to put the bomb down.
[119:52.70]Wait, wait, can I magnetize the banana?
[119:55.26]There's radiation in those fucking things.
[119:56.84]I definitely can.
[120:03.71]Oh my god, there's another banana right there.
[120:05.69]He's gonna see this.
[120:15.91]Okay, try this again.
[120:27.01]I'm looking at mod chat.
[120:27.79]One of the mods said, this is the part of the game where I left and never came back.
[120:46.59]BabyRage, BabyRage.
[120:48.17]I'm glad there's no face cam on because that looked weird.
[121:00.26]I almost snapped my controller at this part.
[121:02.02]I had to take a break.
[121:03.20]Oh no.
[121:08.70]Okay.
[121:10.04]I have an idea.

[122:38.07]I'm alright.
[122:38.45]I'm gonna get to the ladder.
[122:43.08]If he doesn't go for one of those bananas, I'm gonna scream.
[122:54.03]Oh, hell yeah.
[122:54.59]Let's go.
[122:57.97]I don't even... That could be a legendary item.
[123:00.45]The Master Sword could be in that chest.
[123:03.49]I don't care.
[123:04.42]I don't want it.
[123:20.41]I'm kind of concerned right now though.
[123:36.22]Stop.
[123:43.31]Okay, please tell me I did it right.
[123:44.73]I'm going, I'm going!
[123:59.77]No!
[124:00.11]Oh my god, are they here?
[124:10.17]Nobody comes in here, right?
[124:15.24]What just happened?
[124:37.38]Whoa.
[124:41.57]What the hell was that?
[124:42.51]A Tepaz.
[124:49.07]What's a Tepaz?
[125:00.55]Thank god.
[125:14.26]Like in Diablo II.
[125:15.75]Diablo?
[125:16.27]What's Diablo?
[125:17.01]Diablo?
[125:17.47]Hey.
[125:27.78]Uh-oh.
[125:38.06]Who the heck are you?
[125:38.76]And what are you doing in my napping spot?
[125:42.71]Wait a minute.
[125:47.02]That thing on your hip, is that... is that a Sheikah Slate?
[125:51.02]If that's a Sheikah Slate, then that means... That means... It's you!
[125:58.38]You're that Link guy I've been looking for.
[125:59.81]Oh, excuse me.
[126:02.33]I haven't introduced myself yet.
[126:17.84]I'm the leader.
[126:18.58]I'm strong.
[126:20.90]I'm burly.
[126:21.46]The one, the only.
[126:23.68]Master Koga.
[126:29.13]Prepare yourself.
[126:29.83]Okay.
[126:32.07]Bye.
[126:32.25]I was going to say it again.
[127:00.90]No, no, no, no.
[127:01.58]Better.
[127:01.78]Come on.
[127:02.54]I gotta get better than that.
[127:06.08]That's good.
[127:06.76]Oh, look at all the crystals around him.
[127:10.53]No, don't keep the old picture.
[127:15.83]Oh my fucking goddammit.
[127:22.73]Get me out of this.
[127:32.06]What should I use as a weapon?
[127:34.22]Freezing.
[127:34.76]Frostblade.
[127:53.83]I can't turn that into ice?
[128:17.03]What just happened?
[128:29.78]He dropped it on his head!
[128:31.44]Uh-oh.
[128:53.89]Uh-oh, double.
[128:59.85]Where'd they go?
[129:00.51]Just fly at you?
[129:02.15]Hmm.
[129:24.66]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[129:35.17]Boss.
[130:03.32]Same deal, right?
[130:08.26]A little late.
[130:33.63]It's a big one.
[130:34.15]When does he drop it?
[130:41.16]Okay, so it's tethered to him.
[131:04.05]Hmm?
[131:05.09]Again?
[131:05.29]That wasn't bad.
[131:12.99]That's pretty easy.
[131:14.07]Just spawn them.
[131:19.77]You think I'm just going to let this stand?
[131:21.31]Do you?
[131:25.63]Ahem.
[131:26.05]I almost lost my temper there.
[131:27.79]What a pain.
[131:28.33]I can't go out this way.
[131:29.41]What to do?
[131:30.15]What to do?
[131:32.43]He hates this game.
[131:35.50]Why didn't you just use the bow?
[131:38.87]What do you mean?
[131:53.34]I need my serious moves.
[131:56.72]This is the end.
[132:02.62]That was infuriating.
[132:07.40]You're going to be alright.
[132:09.60]You'll be alright.
[132:14.31]You're going to be fine.
[132:20.11]Pretty soon you'll be gone and not just from my light of sight.
[132:24.31]Only the leader of the Yiga clan can use this secret technique.
[132:27.29]It is the... Oh no!
[132:33.01]His own creation?
[132:35.30]Killing him in the end?
[132:39.32]All the hubris, all the arrogance.
[132:42.26]Who could have seen that coming?
[132:44.44]If only he had temperance and patience.
[133:01.55]Oh my God.
[133:01.79]Oh my God.
[133:02.03]Oh my God.
[133:02.27]Oh my God.
[133:02.59]Yes.
[133:03.15]Yes.
[133:03.91]Yes.
[133:04.21]What's in it?
[133:04.67]Yes.
[133:05.01]I can't wait to open this.
[133:06.63]Yes.
[133:07.19]What's in here?
[133:07.75]God.
[133:08.13]Okay.
[133:09.03]Calm down.
[133:10.17]What's in here?
[133:10.61]Okay.
[133:16.43]Precious Gerudo heirloom reclaimed from the Yiga.
[133:21.49]Hooray.
[133:30.94]Yeah.
[133:31.30]No, I didn't.
[133:35.38]Alright.
[133:36.96]Now we can go all the way back here.
[133:38.22]Right?
[133:39.78]We have to bring this back.
[133:46.33]Let's go.
[133:47.11]Save it.
[133:49.21]Yeah.
[133:49.59]Yeah.
[134:04.15]Okay.
[134:06.23]Jeremy, you can just stop playing.
[134:07.27]It's okay.
[134:11.43]What did I say?
[134:11.89]A full letter?
[134:12.75]I said it was an 11, so a full letter grade down would be a 10.
[134:20.10]I'm also saying that so all the Nintendo fans don't, uh, don't murder me.
[134:26.28]Okay.
[134:34.54]Oh, bring this shit down a full letter grade.
[134:38.40]I just heard, I heard like the pitchforks get grabbed.
[134:41.41]Like, off the fucking castle wall.
[134:51.47]Okay.
[134:58.02]Do you think it's a bee?
[135:03.30]I think it's better than a bee.
[135:11.04]I think this is definitely an A. I don't know what kind of A. It could be an A-.
[135:24.45]It could be an A... Just regular A. Wait.
[135:39.70]Am I not allowed in here?
[135:51.37]It feels like a B game with you playing.
[136:01.51]Okay.
[136:01.93]This is 100%.
[136:05.07]This is 100%, at least a 90%.
[136:06.11]We'll see.
[136:31.35]Have the heirloom.
[136:33.03]Oh, okay.
[136:47.40]I would give it an 80, but I'm not Mr. Streamer.
[136:54.95]No, this is a great game.
[136:58.01]Anytime I think a game is great, it's a 90 at least.
[137:12.35]He hates it.
[137:15.22]No, I just hated that section.
[137:16.12]I just hate stealth.
[137:21.54]Even in the game that's built around a stealth game, every time I've played Hitman...
[137:28.29]I sneak past the first guard and then just throw bricks, vases, and fucking briefcases at people.
[137:37.79]I just can't.
[137:38.21]I just don't like them.
[137:39.13]I hate stealth games.
[137:40.75]I do.
[137:41.05]You can say he hates.
[137:41.91]I hate stealth games.
[137:42.97]I hate them.
[137:46.17]I do.
[137:47.29]Fine.
[137:48.85]You got it out of me.
[137:51.09]I don't like them.
[137:53.36]Fine.
[137:54.18]I don't like them.
[137:57.21]That's kind of good.
[137:57.83]I've been holding that in for like 10 years.
[138:01.86]That feels good.
[138:03.58]I'm going to give some more takes.
[138:07.36]You know how I feel about this?
[138:14.26]Just go off on just... How about this take?
[138:16.38]I don't give takes.
[138:17.64]No.
[138:18.08]No, thank you.
[138:24.51]Okay.
[138:28.34]Your arrival in the midst of all this must be the work of Lady Urbosa.
[138:32.92]Please give me the helm.
[138:38.41]Okay.
[138:47.73]Jerma, you only take, you never give.
[138:54.04]You've got to be fucked up today.
[139:20.63]Ah... ...well you certainly got here fast.
[139:24.05]I should have expected as much... ...from the princess's own appointed knight.
[139:29.32]She was out on a survey all day today... ...still as the sands now.
[139:35.28]So... ...Spill It Boy... ...have the two of you been getting along alright?
[139:41.52]I didn't have breakfast this morning.
[139:42.90]I can relax.
[139:44.12]My stomach's grumbling.
[139:45.28]Ever since she was a young girl.
[140:09.08]She's gone through rigorous daily routines to show her dedication.
[140:14.52]She once passed out in the freezing waters trying to access this sealing power.
[140:20.53]And she has nothing to show for it.
[140:24.49]That's the motivation driving her research.
[140:27.82]I'd be doing the same thing.
[140:31.78]She really is quite special.
[140:37.97]You be sure to protect her with your life.
[140:41.65]The game's quiet, sorry.
[140:42.95]You guys are fucking crazy.
[140:44.81]I love it.
[140:45.17]The night brings a chill.
[140:47.33]It's probably time we take her in.
[140:50.34]Hmm.
[140:52.54]Or... I scared the sh- And I just turned it up!
[141:01.14]Oh my god!
[141:02.28]No!
[141:06.62]Hey dude, the game's quiet.
[141:07.66]Did you say that so I would turn it up during the fucking lightning part, dude?
[141:18.21]Oh my god, I'm so sad.
[141:19.33]That scared the shit out of me.
[141:33.56]That was kind of weird.
[141:45.27]I can't get this thing off.
[141:54.91]I must find some way to stop that thing before it threatens my people.
[141:57.55]Of course I'll help.
[142:05.67]Hearing a simple, confident pledge of support from you would be what puts me at ease.
[142:09.73]You guys having a good time?
[142:12.60]One in the chat, you having a good time?
[142:18.52]I'm seeing way too many ones.
[142:21.34]I'm seeing way too many yeses.
[142:24.14]It's a lot of yeses.
[142:25.96]I'm not alright with that.
[142:27.78]You guys having a good time right now?
[142:30.02]I'm not into that.
[142:42.54]I'm so fucked up right now.
[142:43.74]I don't know why.
[142:44.50]Something in the water today.
[142:49.34]I need to get the sand seal.
[142:53.87]The lookout post isn't too far from town.
[142:56.33]We should take a sand seal there.
[142:57.65]You can get some practice in that way.
[142:59.31]Okay.
[143:00.49]Get a sand seal.
[143:07.84]Okay.
[143:08.08]I like that water.
[143:21.34]Oh, another thing about Puss in Boots.
[143:23.24]Did anybody else feel this way?
[143:24.30]I know, um... Holly and I talked about it.
[143:27.76]But I... So much stuff in that movie just looked so delicious.
[143:33.87]This looks like a popsicle.
[143:35.05]Like a glowing popsicle.
[143:57.40]This dude's on another planet right now.
[144:01.64]I promise I didn't just do a bong rip.
[144:05.22]But it's pretty suspicious considering the next thing I said.
[144:09.16]I wanted to eat a majority of the Puss in Boots movie.
[144:13.58]That's very... I understand that that sounded a little suspicious.
[144:23.83]I need to cook.
[144:31.58]I need a... Where can I cook?
[144:32.58]I have a lot of ingredients.
[144:35.57]I'm not going to the Divine Beast until I cook.
[144:41.85]Where can I cook?
[144:45.71]There's got to be a stove around here somewhere, right?
[144:57.61]Why is there... There's got to be a stove.
[145:00.25]Every town has a stove.
[145:05.65]Near the stairs.
[145:07.55]Ow.
[145:11.42]That hurt a lot.
[145:12.92]I hope that wasn't too bad.
[145:13.74]I don't know.
[145:29.61]Where is it?
[145:30.89]Near the stairs, you said?
[145:41.05]I scratched my nose and I scraped the microphone accidentally.
[145:44.67]Sorry about that.
[145:53.25]What?
[145:53.67]Phrasing.
[145:55.73]Very poor choice of words.
[145:57.79]What?
[146:04.59]This fucking bong fellow.
[146:06.05]I can't drink this, so I'm going to leave.
[146:19.39]Can I cook here You mean these stairs
[146:43.23]left I got it okay what do I have for ingredients and I kind of have I forget how this whole system works because you can make potions but you can make food too you don't want to combine both of them so okay I can do a mushroom I can do banana what if I cook a banana
[147:28.71]Okay, there we go.
[147:32.85]What does cooking a banana do?
[147:46.72]Ooh.
[147:47.94]Attack power boost?
[147:49.32]Okay, so that's what that does.
[147:53.67]So, attack power.
[147:58.85]So you can only do one buff.
[148:01.47]So don't combine buffs.
[148:02.43]Okay.
[148:28.56]Here we go.
[148:35.87]Replenishes your stamina when cooked into a dish.
[148:37.93]So this is a stamina replenish.
[148:40.37]This is attack power.
[148:43.49]Banana is also attack power.
[148:44.83]Should I just go all in?
[148:48.07]Sort your inventory.
[148:57.93]Any other attack power?
[148:58.71]I think this is alright.
[149:05.94]Yeah, I'll cook these.
[149:06.52]Maybe this will be a big one?
[149:13.43]Whoa.
[149:17.49]High level attack power boost for four minutes.
[149:20.52]Good.
[149:28.07]One truffle.
[149:29.09]Maybe a steak?
[149:45.32]Just one truffle?
[149:54.06]One truffle only.
[150:02.89]Ah, that's right.
[150:03.51]It's a full recovery.
[150:04.33]So it's going to make a few of these.
[150:05.31]What about truffle and salt?
[150:11.19]Do I have salt?
[150:26.84]That's gonna be a salty truffle.
[150:35.75]Why was that one worse?
[150:55.05]Too much salt.
[151:25.37]Okay.
[151:27.51]Uh, withstand cold.
[151:28.49]Probably four of these and then something else too.
[151:33.75]Something like this.
[151:35.47]Yeah, it's going to be a lot.
[151:44.64]10 minutes of low level cold.
[151:45.64]How many more electricity?
[151:55.41]Bitter cold.
[151:57.83]And then... How about a nutty seasoning?
[152:16.82]That's almost 11 minutes of mid-level cold.
[152:18.60]Okay.
[152:20.22]Okay.
[152:24.06]Electricity protection.
[152:25.12]Some salt.
[152:38.63]Another one of those.
[152:42.56]And... Seasoning.
[152:45.86]Okay.

[153:50.59]So be aware of that.
[153:52.35]There are a lot of things you just can't say today.
[153:54.75]The mods are just having a chuckle.
[153:58.71]There's a hair on that.
[154:02.79]But anyways, hi.
[154:05.09]Thanks, Connor.

[154:21.82]Go follow.
[154:24.92]You got nice hair?
[154:25.61]Hey, thanks.
[154:31.03]Temperance and chastity.
[154:35.03]We don't talk about that when new people show up.
[154:41.65]Uh, this is stamina.
[154:44.33]Stamina?
[154:44.91]Oh.
[154:53.91]Is there any more stamina stuff?
[155:03.54]Oh, that is electricity.
[155:04.50]I didn't, I didn't, I didn't see it as food.
[155:08.80]Defense.
[155:13.23]More hearts.
[155:15.49]Alright.
[155:15.69]We're doing stamina.
[155:20.40]Give me double meat.
[155:22.19]And two salts.
[155:23.27]Let's go.
[155:23.61]Good.
[155:40.48]This is attack power and then just salt.
[155:42.52]Whatever.
[155:42.78]Why not?
[155:43.02]Okay.
[155:51.16]Connor, for all of your viewers, we were talking about how all the seven deadly sins get a ton of screen time.
[155:57.60]But the seven virtues do not.
[156:00.40]We went over it.
[156:02.36]Humility.
[156:03.52]Chastity.
[156:04.76]Temperance.
[156:05.66]Patience.
[156:06.40]Diligence.
[156:14.36]What are the other two?
[156:18.22]Charity.
[156:21.41]Sin.
[156:21.79]Dude, they're all gone by now.
[156:26.47]No!
[156:27.27]Who banned that person for fucking 10 minutes?
[156:52.07]Mid-level electricity.
[156:53.37]Very good.
[156:53.81]I think I'm going to need those, so good.
[156:56.42]Kind of out of ingredients.
[157:19.65]What?
[157:32.18]I would love to hear your opinion on macaroni and cheese.
[157:34.36]This person's name is macaroni and cheese or something.
[157:40.96]What do you mean?
[157:42.00]Do I like it?
[157:49.03]I mean, I love macaroni and cheese.
[157:50.15]It's great.
[157:55.45]Alright, I'm good for now.
[158:03.93]My opinions on macaroni and cheese, it depends on who's making it.
[158:08.11]I've had some runny ass macaroni and cheese before that was awful.
[158:11.47]I've had some really, really good macaroni and cheese that was creamy, delicious.
[158:16.49]Do you want me to tell you what my, you want to know my absolute number one mac and cheese?
[158:22.68]Is that what it is?
[158:32.18]Um, okay.
[158:35.83]My favorite mac and cheese.
[158:36.99]You're not going to say Velveeta, are you?
[158:44.71]No.
[158:46.77]What's happening to me?
[158:49.14]Is it cold or... It's cold.
[158:50.98]Okay.
[158:58.36]Is it too cold?
[158:59.22]How cold is it?
[159:06.86]I'm still this cold?
[159:12.50]Can I just make some shit?
[159:30.43]I could have eaten that stealth food.
[159:33.73]Um, these are all too valuable.
[159:37.11]This is too valuable.
[159:38.09]Alright, hold the fire sword.
[159:40.93]Holy shit, that actually works.
[159:52.02]I thought you were lying.
[159:55.92]Yeah, macaroni and cheese is great.
[159:57.05]I'm a big fan of multiple cheese macaroni and cheese.
[160:08.62]I don't know if I would put breadcrumbs on the top, although I have to be in the mood for it.
[160:19.01]I do not like mac and cheese that is runny.
[160:21.37]If it's runny, get it away from me.
[160:27.04]The cheese needs to be sticking to the noodles.
[160:30.52]I don't want it running off.
[160:37.11]And they also... I don't want that much cheese.
[160:40.23]Some people load it up with... Oh, gooey, gooey, cheesy, right?
[160:43.75]No, no, no.
[160:44.01]It's like too much.
[160:44.59]It's kind of gross.
[160:46.62]Don't overdo it with cheese.
[160:47.86]It's a little too much.
[160:50.48]I like it light.
[160:51.10]I don't want to have a heart attack after I take a bite.
[161:01.56]Oh, damn.
[161:03.13]Golden bow.
[161:06.78]Is this yours?
[161:12.06]What do I get rid of?
[161:12.64]I don't know what to get rid of.
[161:16.12]One of the duplex bows?
[161:26.11]What cheeses though?
[161:28.29]Cheddar?
[161:28.57]Maybe Havarti?
[161:39.38]Swiss cheese can work there.
[161:40.82]Pepper Jack works there.
[161:41.82]Honestly, you can just do whatever you want.
[161:45.61]Most cheeses go pretty well together.
[161:55.87]Except no goat cheese.
[161:57.69]Disgusting.
[162:03.20]Top of the lookout post.
[162:04.04]Okay.
[162:15.15]What about cottage cheese?
[162:16.11]Cottage cheese is fine.
[162:18.69]Oh, that's really cool looking.
[162:24.11]Cottage cheese with a little bit of cracked just pepper all over it is pretty good.
[162:32.38]Gouda is really good.
[162:33.24]Actually, I'm not a big fan of brie.
[162:34.68]I don't like soft cheeses really.
[162:40.94]Cottage cheese and pepper.
[162:43.57]Try it one day.
[162:44.83]Then come back and report.
[162:54.41]Alright, we're doing another Divine Beast.
[162:55.49]Let's go.
[163:02.75]The Sand Seals to get in really close to that thing.
[163:04.91]I'll take the lead.
[163:08.01]I like Feta.
[163:09.51]But Feta's not goat cheese.
[163:14.65]Shoot at its feet with bomb arrows.
[163:16.57]Okay.
[163:18.55]It's not.
[163:32.96]It can be.
[163:33.64]I know the difference.
[163:38.06]Staying close to not get shocked.
[163:41.69]Retreat.
[163:49.15]okay not she said wait there's here's not many you gave me 20. feta is sheep so I'm sorry everybody feta is not goat it is sheep alright stop asking me my opinions of cheeses you're trying to derail the whole day
[164:22.94]Okay.
[164:26.54]I need bomb arrows.
[164:27.36]I should probably put the other bow on.
[164:29.14]Divine Beast Va Naboris.
[164:51.74]I built a computer one time, like 10 years ago, and it made that sound when I turned it on and I turned it off, unplugged it from the wall and cried.
[164:58.64]It's a true story.
[165:10.55]It was a little longer than 10.
[165:12.95]It was probably, I don't know how long ago, maybe 15, more than 15 years ago.
[165:17.11]I don't remember.
[165:31.84]Why would you cry?
[165:32.82]Because I don't know, I like saved up a bunch of money and I'm going to build a computer and I put it all together and it was just like... It took like all day.
[165:43.99]It just was like overwhelming fucking sadness.
[165:47.95]I couldn't help it.
[165:48.61]I was just like, this sucks.
[165:49.77]I'm fucking so sad.
[165:51.09]Yeah, who wouldn't cry for that?
[165:58.14]Are you kidding me?
[166:00.21]That's what a disaster of a day.
[166:07.03]I want to take out a different bow because this shoots multiple arrows.
[166:11.96]Put this one on.
[166:23.32]What's going on?
[166:26.72]Wait, there's a shrine.
[166:40.90]Why am I having so much trouble controlling this?
[166:51.85]It only shoots... Oh, okay.
[166:54.79]Is that what I want, though?
[167:04.35]How do I put this down?
[167:05.05]Okay, good.
[167:14.68]You play games like a Midwestern mother.
[167:19.56]Okay.
[167:36.13]Let's go!
[167:52.68]That was really fast.
[167:54.60]Wow, that was really good.
[167:56.06]So good, so good.
[167:58.12]Midwestern mother, huh?
[168:05.56]But why don't you just go upstairs and go to bed, don't you know?
[168:12.80]I will not be hearing any more of that.
[168:14.99]I will not be hearing any more of that.
[168:17.35]Unfortunately, I cannot appease Naboris on my own.
[168:22.25]I have no choice but to entrust the rest to you.
[168:33.01]That's Canadian.
[168:37.22]Oh, boy.
[168:37.90]Yeah, you betcha.
[168:39.46]That's not Canadian.
[168:41.28]That's not Canadian.
[168:44.30]That's Midwest.
[168:45.94]I'm having trouble.
[168:47.21]All I can hear is the audio.
[168:51.54]That's Minnesota.
[168:53.48]Wisconsin.
[168:56.24]Huh?
[169:00.64]That's Northern Midwest.
[169:02.14]It's still the Midwest.
[169:08.78]Minnesota.
[169:11.89]It's Northern Midwestern.
[169:13.13]You can't say Northern Midwestern and say it's not Midwestern.
[169:25.88]Soda!
[169:31.88]Well, well, well.
[169:40.30]You sure do know how to keep a woman waiting.
[169:42.88]What happened?
[169:43.92]I can't wait to see you take Noboris back from Ganon.
[169:50.44]One thing at a time.
[169:52.56]You'll need a map to find your way around.
[169:55.48]Oh no, this looks tricky.
[170:07.95]Somebody said this is the hardest Divine Beast.
[170:13.62]Okay.
[170:21.10]I think I held on to this.
[170:36.62]I need more weapons.
[170:38.29]So badly.
[170:38.95]I need more weapon slots.
[170:40.69]Get rid of this torch.
[170:43.19]Okay.
[170:45.77]Um, don't you have to destroy this stuff?
[170:48.59]Shoot the eye or something, right?
[170:54.11]Okay, so where are we going?
[170:56.21]This level's gonna make me puke.
[171:00.27]Oh man, I don't like that.
[171:01.29]The background moving like that.
[171:09.86]Ugh.
[171:10.00]Okay.
[171:12.48]Okay.
[171:33.59]Okay.
[171:36.07]Electricity field?
[171:38.42]Maybe?
[171:44.48]No, you guys have been good.
[171:46.14]Put it on.
[172:02.31]One.
[172:10.93]I need a map.
[172:12.55]What's with the horror music?
[172:19.39]It's like scary music.
[172:36.22]Ancient Battleaxe?
[172:37.36]I'll take it.
[172:52.20]Damn, look at that.
[172:59.84]This brightness is so bright.
[173:01.32]Okay.
[173:16.89]Well, they want me to have 50 of these for some reason, so I guess I'll hold on to it.
[173:22.53]Wait, can I shoot through here?
[173:23.91]I don't think so.
[173:47.80]Whoa.
[174:00.70]I climb this?
[174:13.59]Go down there.
[174:16.67]Check the other side.
[174:35.32]I lost the weapon, but whatever.
[174:36.34]Alright, what about here?
[174:43.30]Can you stop mashing the piano, please?
[175:13.91]Stop going like this on the piano where you just take all your fingers and just smush down.
[175:22.97]That gets you thrown out.
[175:25.39]That gets you thrown out, by the way.
[175:31.80]I don't care where you are.
[175:32.78]I don't know if you're in a house.
[175:35.04]If you do that, you're getting thrown out.
[175:36.92]This is going to happen.
[175:38.08]Just don't do that.
[175:46.28]You could be having a very, very normal conversation.
[175:50.00]Hanging out.
[175:51.36]Oh, hey.
[175:52.52]Oh, you got a piano?
[175:53.48]Oh, cool.
[175:53.96]Let me open it up.
[175:59.11]Someone's coming in that room and going, get out.
[176:02.71]Get out.
[176:03.37]I don't want you here anymore.
[176:04.31]Get out.
[176:05.81]No, it's time for you to go home.
[176:25.20]Alright, the thing obviously spins, but how do I spin it?
[176:27.44]I had to get up there, up there.
[176:33.38]Oh, I can go that way.
[176:39.40]No, I can't.
[176:45.14]I... I think I can make it from here.
[176:50.46]Let's try it.
[176:57.63]OK.
[176:58.07]Dude, what the hell is going on here?
[177:03.07]I gotta get over there.
[177:05.01]Oh fuck, I went the wrong way.
[177:07.05]Or did I?
[177:10.58]Oh, OK.
[177:23.24]Good to know.
[177:35.59]Ancient spring.
[177:42.27]Can't believe bald coin is still an emote.
[177:44.37]Never deleted it.
[177:44.93]I could have gone out that way, but whatever.
[177:56.65]No, no, no.
[178:05.93]It's the most that emote's been used in five years.
[178:20.61]Oh, now I get the map.
[178:22.45]Good.
[178:36.64]Okay.
[178:38.98]Oh, I have to... I can rotate it.
[178:43.52]So the middle is a cylinder that spins.
[178:47.78]Who's talking to me?
[179:13.85]Okay.
[179:14.67]Rotate 90 degrees.
[179:17.03]Execute.
[179:34.42]Wait, I can do this one.
[179:36.20]Or do I have to do all before this one?
[179:37.56]Or can I do this one now?
[179:42.84]No, this is the last one.
[179:43.76]Okay, so this one... Um... Ah, shit.
[179:59.89]Whoa, this... Actually, wait a minute.
[180:07.45]Okay.
[180:10.95]Where is this one?
[180:13.84]It's right there.
[180:15.00]Okay, here we go.
[180:25.40]Ready?
[180:25.82]Let's go!
[180:40.61]I can probably get this one right now.
[180:43.65]Oops.
[180:49.05]What about this one?
[181:12.49]Can I pull it?
[181:15.51]Shit!
[181:24.91]Shit!
[181:38.04]Should have froze it.
[181:39.02]Freeze time.
[181:39.58]God damn it.
[181:53.96]Alright.
[181:59.35]This is like fucked up out here.
[183:02.38]Forgot I got that one already.
[183:06.03]It's blue.
[183:15.90]How do I spin that around?
[183:38.61]How do I spin this?
[183:41.07]There's electricity up here.
[183:53.73]Which I'm imagining if the government make it go across the whole thing.
[183:56.93]I don't know.
[184:06.53]What are you doing all like this for?
[184:36.91]What did that do?
[185:16.36]I... I... You know what happened.
[185:20.10]I don't even need to tell you what happened.
[185:27.85]Okay.
[185:39.07]Do I want to go up there or maybe down?
[185:41.09]I don't know.
[185:42.42]Maybe I try this way.
[185:43.68]I'm just going to go.
[185:44.64]I got to explore.
[185:46.14]Now that I know that I can do that.
[186:09.75]There's a hole in the top.
[186:12.84]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[186:14.00]I know what to do.
[186:15.18]There's a hole at the top.
[186:15.98]Am I gonna get up and through the hole?
[186:51.82]Maybe I should go this way.
[186:52.60]What does this do?
[187:33.23]This needs to be electrified.
[187:34.37]Right?
[187:38.46]Fuck.
[187:49.36]Okay, well at least I figured out what it wants me to do.
[188:00.52]electrify this to get the last one.
[188:02.74]I can climb up here, but this is... Hmm.
[188:15.27]How do I get all the way up?
[188:22.83]Can I climb from here?
[188:23.87]I have no idea.
[188:29.64]I have no...
[188:31.11]Freaking idea.
[188:39.07]The only thing I can think of is to be in that hole.
[188:42.65]What happens if I do it again?
[188:43.79]Where's this hole go?
[188:55.58]Can I stand on top of it or something?
[189:10.96]Alright, I gotta get out there.
[189:12.82]Where's the hole?
[189:15.74]I'm gonna do something really stupid.
[189:24.65]Give me a second.
[189:29.73]That was stupid.
[189:30.83]That was really stupid.
[189:35.37]I just heard the...
[189:41.03]Not many moving parts.
[190:12.83]Can I stand on that or something?
[190:15.41]Hold on.
[190:16.43]No, I can't.
[190:16.99]Can I climb up?
[190:26.96]Where does this other hole go?
[190:29.59]This thing is powered right now.
[190:59.62]I think my chat just crashed.
[191:20.98]And my chat crashed.
[191:21.79]I still live.
[191:32.91]Aw, I'm just gonna act like I am.
[191:50.47]Wait, the stream turned off?
[191:53.25]Huh?
[191:56.23]That's weird.
[192:02.84]I don't have any dropped frames or anything.
[192:17.02]Now I can see you.
[192:21.61]Maybe I can't.
[192:24.41]My Twitch is fucked up.
[192:27.51]My Internet's fine.
[192:29.15]I have no access to chat.
[192:32.98]Well.
[192:34.78]Come on.
[193:00.95]Come on.
[193:04.50]Come on, where are you?
[193:12.99]We heard you make a puke sound and then it stopped.
[193:15.81]Yeah, I got no drop frames.
[193:18.01]That's weird.
[193:21.90]What are you doing?
[193:22.56]What are you doing?
[193:23.46]What's going on?
[193:25.50]What the hell?
[193:27.24]I fucking bumped it.
[194:03.08]Give me the elevator.
[194:17.41]What?
[194:17.65]Oh, no.
[194:17.95]My chat's back.
[194:18.63]Okay.
[194:19.07]Everyone's saying not like this.
[194:20.09]Did I do it in the wrong order?
[194:21.76]I got it.
[194:31.92]It's right here.
[194:35.75]We're good.
[194:39.26]Jump right now to prove you have free will.
[194:41.50]Time that person up for 20 minutes.
[194:50.77]Wait, the stream crashed again.
[194:52.01]Maybe Twitch is having problems.
[194:56.93]Alright.
[194:58.61]Uh, there are... Alright, I gotta get up there.
[195:14.39]Alright, that's that.
[195:17.07]Whoa.
[195:22.23]Two more.
[195:22.89]Should we pin a message saying refresh?
[195:27.36]Um, maybe for a few minutes, yeah.
[195:32.72]I think they see it now.
[195:33.40]Alright, good.
[195:44.23]Alright, only two more.
[195:46.31]The last two are up.
[195:48.47]One is across that way.
[195:50.60]Let me see.
[195:55.10]So on the other side, on the same level that I'm at right now.
[195:59.12]Okay.
[196:01.98]What the hell is this?
[196:20.91]I need electricity in there.
[196:24.23]Oh, shit.
[196:25.25]Really?
[196:27.25]What had happened?
[196:28.25]What just happened?
[196:30.55]Wait, what?
[196:31.87]Oh, I spun it accidentally.
[196:33.37]We're good.
[196:41.15]We are good.
[196:42.05]We're powered again.
[196:53.05]Anything over here?
[196:58.27]Get rid of that.
[197:10.88]OK.
[197:13.10]I need to get power there.
[197:27.27]Radishes sounds good.
[197:39.59]It is a bunch of shit this way.
[197:42.05]Did that alright?
[197:42.67]What about over here?
[197:43.23]Maybe very careful.
[197:56.03]What the fuck?
[197:57.73]Did you just hear what I said?
[197:58.75]I said be careful.
[198:00.48]And you just didn't do it.
[198:02.70]Correctly.
[198:05.58]Now what?
[198:08.16]I just slipped right off.
[198:09.24]I don't think you can walk on that.
[198:13.62]Where's the eye?
[198:14.04]Is there no eye on this one?
[198:22.89]I'm kind of screwed, aren't I?
[198:56.45]Shit!
[199:00.19]What is going on?
[199:00.91]What is this?
[199:01.33]Is electricity here?
[199:02.17]What?
[199:18.67]This shit's all blocked up now.
[199:24.94]Okay.
[199:26.58]I need to go up.
[199:28.66]Where am I looking right now?
[199:29.86]It's up there.
[199:30.68]I think I fucked everything up.
[199:43.13]I was on the right track.
[199:43.95]I think I screwed it all up though.
[199:59.30]Damn it.
[200:00.32]Now I gotta remember how to do this all again.
[200:01.90]I gotta turn the power back on, right?
[200:09.35]I don't know.
[200:12.57]Fuck that.
[200:22.52]Look at that.
[200:23.30]How do I get over there?
[200:28.85]Come on, how do I get in here?
[200:31.51]Come on, dude, really?
[200:32.53]I gotta drop from there.
[200:40.20]Uuugh!
[201:22.93]Hurry up.
[201:34.50]You can do them at the same time.
[201:35.84]Do I do them at the same time or something?
[201:42.95]I wonder if that works.
[201:55.56]Okay, power is back on.
[201:57.42]I can go that way again.
[202:01.51]This shit is right next to me.
[202:03.67]It's right here.
[202:06.51]Come on.
[202:07.87]How do I get up there?
[202:08.67]I'm gonna go back around.
[202:12.64]I'm gonna go up and see if I can figure out how to get down there.
[202:28.60]Maybe I should go up there.
[202:29.60]Through that hole.
[202:36.76]Well, where would that take me?
[202:46.01]Oh my God, damn it, dude.
[202:48.64]I'm about to put a fucking hole through my monitor.
[203:00.03]Sorry, I'm playing Breath of the Wild.
[203:34.61]Okay.
[203:34.83]Get out of the way.
[203:39.45]I wanna look.
[203:39.92]So if I go up... I got an idea.
[203:48.33]I just wanna- I'm just gonna look.
[203:49.91]I just wanna look.
[203:51.27]Don't press it!
[204:01.73]I wish I could just rebind the keys.
[204:04.49]Because B is just A and A is B. Just let me rebind the keys for the love of God!
[204:31.21]It's like three lines of code and I'm making that up because I'm frustrated.
[204:35.84]But I'm just saying it could be.
[204:37.10]Okay.
[204:51.45]I'm going all the way up.
[205:03.69]I'm going through that fucking hole.
[205:05.45]No, I'm not.
[206:01.06]I don't know.
[206:05.57]I'm afraid to jump over here.
[206:06.53]Because I don't think I'll make it.
[206:23.67]Look at that shit right there.
[206:25.12]What is this one of power?
[206:27.66]How do I get that to be turned on?
[206:30.90]How do I turn that on?
[206:32.10]Can I pull it out?
[206:47.64]Can I throw a bomb at it?
[206:50.62]It needs to be powered by something.
[207:05.52]I just don't know.
[207:06.04]I just don't get it.
[207:06.68]I mean, I kind of get it, but... How do I get on the other side of this?
[207:21.53]I need to go from this direction to blow up the shit that's over there and then power that somehow.
[207:55.23]Okay.
[207:58.41]This one is the grate that you have to fall into.
[208:01.53]But I have to get over there first.
[208:02.73]I have to get on this side of the beast.
[208:12.34]I'm fucking going for it.
[208:32.62]There's no eye.
[208:45.93]Damn it.
[208:50.63]There's a hole there.
[208:51.65]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[209:03.63]How do I get... Okay, that's now... This is now powered.
[209:08.46]Nobody move.
[209:10.40]Where is that?
[209:13.28]That's below... That's below me.
[209:18.52]Where is that elevator?
[209:25.19]Where's that elevator?
[209:27.55]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[209:35.12]Am I... Can I... Am I in trouble here?
[209:36.68]Alright, that elevator's working.
[209:40.40]And then... Down here, and then... I don't know.
[209:43.55]Do I just have to go to the main room?
[209:49.07]Just go back to the main room, and is there an elevator there now?
[209:51.29]I can't get out this way.
[210:01.16]I'm seeing a lot of no's.
[210:02.14]Fuck.
[210:04.30]Fuck.
[210:15.12]Up here first, maybe.
[210:26.24]Up here.
[210:27.74]Through the thingy.
[210:30.12]And then down.
[210:31.02]Holy shit, it says I've only been streaming for 20 minutes.
[210:34.11]The stream really did go down.
[210:39.45]Okay, now how do I get this to go up?
[210:42.72]I just accidentally stepped off it.
[211:00.93]I didn't know, I didn't know there was another lever.
[211:04.06]Another layer.
[211:05.62]I did not know this went up twice.
[211:09.98]That wasn't telegraphed properly.
[211:11.20]That wasn't telegraphed properly.
[211:14.72]It was improperly telegraphed, for sure.
[211:22.26]If I had known this went up a second time, I would have been fine.
[211:31.53]Okay.
[211:39.79]OK, I should be close now.
[211:45.83]Alright, what is that for?
[211:51.82]I'm terrified to leave this area without knowing what that is.
[212:09.74]What does this do?
[213:04.83]So what?
[213:06.05]What the hell does that even help me with?
[213:11.58]Maybe I should just drop down.
[213:12.94]Wait, wait, wait.
[213:13.70]Let me go back and look at this.
[213:14.50]I think I can get the one in the crate.
[213:29.69]Isn't it right down here?
[213:32.27]What the hell is that?
[213:35.03]It's like a green ball.
[213:36.07]What on Earth?
[213:42.17]What are you doing to me here?
[213:43.55]Okay.
[213:48.03]What should I do with the ball?
[214:12.81]This is the back.
[214:14.77]Maybe there's something down here.
[214:15.75]Can I do this?
[214:18.84]In this way?
[214:19.34]I don't want to screw this up because I don't think this is right.
[214:21.90]Hold on.
[214:35.84]I think I need to get the ball.
[214:36.74]Do I need to bring the ball with me?
[214:41.67]I'm terrified to go anywhere.
[214:42.75]That's what I was thinking.
[215:07.59]Give me this.
[215:08.03]Give me this.
[215:08.43]I fucking want it.
[215:24.99]I'll take it.
[215:35.72]Dude.
[215:38.62]Come on.
[215:39.60]Like, you know what I'm fucking aiming at.
[215:41.93]Like... Like a fucking wet sock.
[216:08.10]What is going on with... What is happening right now?
[216:11.58]I feel like I'm playing in quicksand.
[216:18.15]Alright, now where the hell do I bring this fucking thing?
[216:35.03]Down here, right?
[216:36.45]No?
[216:36.73]This is wrong?
[216:50.74]That's wrong.
[216:54.22]Why did I pick this up?
[216:55.16]Bring it back up to the top, maybe?
[217:01.58]What needed power that I couldn't...
[217:06.05]It's the only thing I can think of.
[217:33.63]What do I need to do with this up top?
[217:44.78]Is there actually something out here?
[217:51.74]I have no fucking idea.
[217:52.66]This place is fucking crazy.
[217:56.57]I don't remember what I'm supposed to be powering with this.
[218:13.48]I'm about to let you out so you can help.
[218:17.62]Let him out.
[218:18.84]Let him out.
[218:20.26]Let him out.
[218:22.61]Let him out.
[218:22.95]What the hell do I do with this thing?
[218:38.13]You're so close.
[218:39.11]I know, but one little mistake puts me back to the beginning.
[218:44.06]And I don't wanna do that.
[218:49.45]You can rebind your keys?
[218:51.63]That's the first thing everyone's screaming.
[218:54.75]Go rebind your keys!
[219:14.14]April fools do I take this I'm just gonna carry this with me everywhere I go for now for a minute what there's another one right here why do they why are there two of these fucking cube balls why are they two I just brought it up to hang out with his fucking sibling

[219:53.54]I'm bringing them both downstairs.
[219:54.72]They're both coming with me.
[220:07.87]No help.
[220:08.49]Yes, help me!
[221:13.55]Two balls Bradley.
[221:19.87]Can I take it off of this?
[221:27.36]Oh wait, OK.
[221:30.40]So it doesn't need to stay on there.
[221:32.56]I did it finally.
[221:45.47]I need to go back and beat Lew three times at the Fox and Geese game.
[221:51.69]This one was fucked.
[221:53.19]I don't like this one.
[221:54.33]This one was fucked up.
[221:56.57]I don't like this one at all.
[221:57.47]I don't like this one at all.
[222:09.94]How do I get this out of the way?
[222:11.72]Power this!
[222:20.00]And then open it.
[222:25.72]How do I open this?
[222:26.56]Don't crush me!
[222:30.46]How do I drop down here?
[222:34.87]You can't get in from here?
[222:35.73]Oh, bro, you gotta get squished.
[222:57.22]I don't know, dude.
[223:00.04]Have to go out the side holes.
[223:01.30]I feel like I tried that and I couldn't get it to work.
[223:08.33]So I'll just go right down to the bottom.
[223:10.01]Like, of the actual level.
[223:11.26]Just get out of here and go to the... You don't need the balls anymore?
[223:15.96]Okay.

[225:25.94]Get me out of here.
[225:32.28]Well done.
[225:33.56]That was the last of the terminals.
[225:35.89]Now, you'll need to start up the main control unit.
[225:39.81]I know where it is.
[225:47.36]System settings, controller settings, change button mapping.
[225:50.56]Uh, I'll take a break and do it.
[225:56.03]Alright, now I just gotta get to the front.
[226:30.96]How's temperance going?
[226:32.06]Oh, we're going full wrath.
[226:35.28]This is the hardest boss you have fucked.
[227:09.17]There's too many buttons in this game.
[227:11.39]There are too many buttons in this game.
[227:15.84]There are like 60 different inputs in Breath of the Wild.
[227:20.56]There are too many buttons.
[227:26.52]There are far too many buttons.
[227:35.14]There's so many fucking buttons.
[227:38.17]Relax.

[228:47.51]Good luck.
[228:47.91]Do not allow this to be your end.
[228:50.83]Fight for your life.
[228:53.99]Good thing I just used the divine strength on shooting myself with a bomb arrow.
[228:58.27]This thing is fast.

[230:12.86]Excuse me?
[230:13.36]How do I get back up there?
[230:28.70]I gotta redo the whole thing.
[230:29.76]No, I don't.
[230:34.02]It was right there.
[230:35.98]Sorry, I'm about to eat my controller about how much I hate this part of the game.
[230:46.31]This whole Gerudo Valley.
[230:50.17]If I do a second playthrough, I'm not coming over here ever again.
[230:55.12]Where?
[230:55.48]Oh my god, what just happened?
[231:00.16]No, we're good.

[232:47.14]What the hell happened?
[232:48.00]It's fire?

[233:02.04]I didn't even read his name.
[233:02.90]Okay.

[234:16.51]It's A with the shield out.
[234:23.41]A?
[234:32.74]I just did it.
[234:42.28]Oh my god.
[234:43.34]I'm doing it my way.
[235:02.79]My shield's not out anymore.
[235:05.85]Jesus.
[235:17.49]Alright, let's go.
[235:21.63]Oh shit, I need to have a... It's going to be a one-handed weapon.
[235:36.83]Do I have another one-hander?
[235:48.89]Uh, Royal Claymore.
[236:03.66]Why not?
[236:08.37]Can I take my shield out without... I don't know how to do that.
[236:12.61]Do I have to have a one-hander?
[236:13.81]Or can I pull the shield out somehow?
[236:22.11]No, okay.
[236:22.49]I'm going to have to backflip over it then.
[236:29.25]Okay.
[236:47.01]Phase two.
[236:47.49]I don't even know where he is!
[237:05.37]Where is he?
[237:37.64]Fucking camera down.
[237:39.10]Oh my god.
[237:40.57]Hold left bumper.
[237:41.23]And then up.
[237:41.77]And then hold left.
[237:42.25]And then A. And then hit right bumper.
[237:44.14]Oh my goodness.
[238:03.03]Look what I have!
[238:04.19]What do I do with this?
[238:05.25]Do I just stick it in his face?
[238:07.16]What do I do with it?
[238:08.44]Did I get him?
[238:25.27]You reading chat?
[238:30.29]Sometimes.
[238:32.11]Very rarely.
[238:45.91]I can't be on the ground.
[238:56.06]Rarely when I'm fighting a boss.
[238:57.10]Find a way around that thing's shield.
[239:11.88]I just freaked out.
[239:12.56]I thought he was jumping at me.
[239:15.00]Bro, you should get a ring light.
[239:16.60]I don't want... I have it.
[239:18.80]It's just not turned on.
[239:19.82]Alright, leave me alone.
[239:40.97]What?
[239:43.17]I can freeze him.
[239:48.94]Oh my god, dude.
[239:50.68]Oh my god.
[239:51.50]Why would that help, though?
[240:08.56]This doesn't hurt him.
[240:16.08]your neck it does what do you mean that one was a dud I have to do it before he strikes it I don't even know where the hell this guy is
[240:49.68]Fuck you.

[241:07.69]How many times does he swing?
[241:13.55]What the fuck?
[241:16.04]What the hell?
[241:18.51]I don't care about the low level stealth boost.
[241:20.29]I need the fucking hearts.
[241:23.98]Where's my weapon?
[241:37.04]No!
[241:37.86]Why don't you fucking strike some lightning down here, lady?
[241:40.63]I don't know who you're even talking about.
[241:52.71]What direction is he swinging?
[241:54.05]And you drop the fucking weapon every time he hits you?
[242:03.35]Stop attacking!
[242:04.47]That shit is broken.
[242:35.17]Oh my god, the damage is unreal.
[242:38.50]I just have to eat everything.
[243:04.15]Joy yeah, I
[243:38.74]That was really hard.
[243:42.31]It was crazy.
[243:57.85]My eyes hurt.
[244:00.84]Yeah, that was Cleric Beast.
[244:08.70]What did I say?
[244:09.16]Delete this whole part of the game.
[244:26.51]Our container.
[244:30.27]It was genuinely a skill issue.
[244:32.57]That's all a skill issue.
[244:40.56]Cool.
[244:52.04]Two more to the Master Sword.
[244:53.10]I'm looking forward to that.
[245:08.34]I knew you wouldn't let us down.
[245:10.35]I was wearing metal armor.
[245:12.93]My soul is free and the borders is ours once again.
[245:18.39]Which means that finally we can complete what we started years ago.
[245:23.56]We Gerudo have no tolerance for unfinished business.
[245:31.01]I lost so many points believing tonight.
[245:36.48]I'm sorry.
[245:39.56]As well as for the moment when I incinerate Ganon into a pile of ash.
[245:45.90]Which reminds me, I wanted to give you a little something.
[245:50.19]Please accept this gift, which has come to be known as Urbosa's Fury.
[245:56.23]It will no doubt be of use to you.
[246:05.31]That like... You don't hear that ever.
[246:17.33]Both you and the princess, I know you have suffered much regarding what happened to us champions.
[246:24.05]But this is how things had to happen.
[246:26.81]No one need carry blame.
[246:29.05]So please, make it clear so she understands that.
[246:33.26]Tell her to shed any worries.
[246:36.44]Yeah?
[246:36.56]Yeah?
[246:36.66]Bro, you're not even wearing- I was wearing metal armor and dying in like two hits.
[247:08.84]I feel like every single thing that I could have done wrong, I did wrong during the last hour.
[247:14.34]Like everything.
[247:15.42]To the items I was wearing, to the strategy I had.
[247:19.08]I feel like I was just doing every single possible thing incorrect for like 45 straight minutes.
[247:35.67]You did it your way.
[247:55.44]Yeah, we'll take a break.
[248:03.82]Don't worry, it's still a 90.
[248:04.77]It's still an A, but don't worry.
[248:09.19]I love people concerned.
[248:25.39]End of the stream?
[248:25.97]No, no, no.
[248:27.37]We'll go for like another hour.
[248:42.62]Noboru.
[248:44.36]Legend of the Gerudo.
[248:46.08]Celebrated over ages.
[248:48.88]And you, who were named to honor him.
[248:51.95]You are a legend as well.
[248:54.23]Isn't that right, Naboris?
[248:58.07]Yeah, stream crashed halfway through.
[248:59.33]The great essence of defeat from a century ago still sits upon my tongue.
[249:04.86]But that is now in the past.
[249:08.42]It was written that Calamity Ganon once adopted the form of a Gerudo.
[249:15.50]And that will make this victory all the more sad.
[249:20.13]How much harder is the game if you just go right again?
[249:22.25]It's just like impossible.
[249:23.05]You would cry on master mode.
[249:48.62]I cry on normal difficulty.
[249:50.86]I would probably agree with you.
[249:56.95]I cried when I fried my PC.
[249:58.97]I cry at everything.
[250:04.67]I cried in the end of Puss in Boots.
[250:06.51]I didn't even read what that said.
[250:10.13]That was incredibly important and I have no idea what it was.
[250:18.81]I cried at the end of Ghostbusters Afterlife.
[250:21.29]Guys, I cry at everything, okay?
[250:26.80]Hold Y. Whoa.
[250:31.72]Hold it for longer.
[250:46.11]Hold it for longer.
[250:51.84]In what scenario would you ever be able to hold it for this long?
[250:55.91]Damn.
[251:07.58]Oh, okay.
[251:08.42]Hold on.
[251:10.94]It does 500 damage?
[251:12.74]Damn.
[251:12.96]Damn.
[251:20.46]Make sure it starts to recharge.
[251:21.99]That's a good idea.
[251:26.68]Very cool.
[251:27.30]Oh, I can do that.
[251:50.60]gone forever no they recharge I'm gonna take a quick break let's complete this quest and then I'm gonna take a break we'll go for like another hour or two
[252:14.88]Naboris is no longer a threat to the town.
[252:16.50]I'm still worried about the larger threat to Hyrule, but at least my people won't be troubled by Naboris anymore.
[252:21.40]Ooh.
[252:26.74]Two trinkets.
[252:30.66]Priceless treasures of the Gerudo people.
[252:33.13]It's only right that you should have them.
[252:36.93]Okay.
[252:45.17]Cool weapon.
[252:47.39]Wow.
[252:49.25]Scimitar of the Seven.
[252:50.27]Nice.
[252:58.59]Daybreaker.
[253:02.45]Very cool.
[253:06.14]What can I get rid of?
[253:11.60]Why do I even have that?
[253:19.79]Very cool.
[253:24.17]Alright.
[253:25.10]So... Now... Where do I go now?
[253:35.02]Up here?
[253:40.11]Up here?
[253:49.50]Can I take that helmet?
[253:51.12]Can I have it?
[254:00.73]Yeah, I want it.
[254:01.17]Oh.
[254:11.56]Yes, lend it to me.
[254:18.52]Oh, I have to do side quests.
[254:34.51]Okay.
[254:37.25]So... What's going on here?
[254:53.31]Legendary rabbit trial.
[254:59.03]Look at the side stuff.
[255:07.42]Okay, so I could go up here.
[255:11.71]I think I'm going to go here and go up.
[255:18.78]But I'll be right back.
[255:19.38]I'm going to take a first break.
[255:22.05]I'll be back in maybe five minutes.
[255:24.97]See you in a sec.
[258:08.31]Okay.
[259:08.00]Thank you.
[259:51.45]I'm back.
[259:56.34]How's it going?
[260:07.00]He was crying off camera.
[260:10.51]Yeah.
[260:17.69]Do you like Big Chungus?
[260:18.59]Big Chungus was in the Space Jam movie.
[260:22.67]For half a second.
[260:26.05]Somebody told me that, and then I thought they made it up.
[260:27.75]I was like, there's no way that Big Chungus is in the movie.
[260:30.66]And Big Chungus is in the movie.
[260:41.42]Did you cry when Big Chungus showed up?
[260:45.26]Yeah, I was so fucking moved, like, that they had... It was very moving.
[260:52.48]What's this?
[260:55.96]Oh, it's this thing.
[260:56.77]Okay, I need my horse back.
[261:10.90]Where is Frank 2?
[261:13.20]Where are you, Frank 2?
[261:16.26]Over here.
[261:17.34]I need to go get Frank too.
[261:25.98]Thanks for your opinion on Big Chungus.
[261:29.75]You're welcome.
[261:39.91]Okay, let's put some armor on.
[262:00.13]Alright.
[262:01.33]Let's actually go.
[262:02.39]Where you at?
[262:18.02]Merchant?
[262:19.12]What do you got?
[262:29.50]OK, I'll take three of these.
[262:31.00]These are cheap.
[262:36.10]10 rupees, that's it?
[262:37.93]This is really cheap.
[262:44.31]Very cool.
[262:53.95]OK.
[262:54.89]Can I teleport with the horse?
[263:01.61]come on we can't go together well looks like we're walking
[263:29.08]Go to any stable and get it from there.
[263:34.54]I don't want to walk all the way.
[263:35.58]Let's try this again.
[264:07.30]There's a saddle that lets you call your horse from anywhere.
[264:09.88]Pretty good.
[264:11.32]We all get it eventually.
[264:29.64]Wait, we can't go over here anyways.
[264:31.88]Wait, am I going the wrong way?
[264:43.16]Why was that turned around?
[264:44.96]I thought I was going the right way.
[264:52.66]No horse in the desert.
[264:54.00]Yeah, that's right.
[265:14.03]Vinny beats Jerma's Time.
[265:15.27]Vinny beats Jerma's Time.
[265:16.45]Vinny's... What is this?
[265:23.53]Vinny beats Jerma's Time.
[265:24.59]Playing Resident Evil 4.
[265:28.64]Hold on.
[265:45.36]Dude, my connection to Twitch is, like, awful for some reason.
[265:51.98]Okay, let's see it.
[265:59.00]...early.
[266:02.74]So... Bro, come on!
[266:11.03]What?!
[266:11.51]...early.
[266:15.15]how how would you do that in two turns no way wow you can actually do it in two spins oh that was easy hey I ain't the only one that have has trouble with this
[266:40.33]I know for a fact that there are a shitload of other people that just kind of... It's like a... It's one of those scenarios where if you do it wrong... Yeah, you can do it in two turns.
[266:52.26]But if you don't do it immediately correct, you fuck the whole thing up for like 10 minutes.
[267:05.95]Yeah, it's a shitload of us.
[267:09.20]It's a shitload of us and that's fine.
[267:11.26]That's so funny though.
[267:14.76]I did it in two turns by accident.
[267:20.47]That's so funny.
[267:23.21]Chat told him you took forever.
[267:29.55]It's alright.
[267:31.01]That's so funny though.
[267:37.54]Two turns.
[267:51.63]You would have taken forever?
[267:52.53]I did take forever, that already happened.
[267:56.94]Just reading chat.
[267:57.68]Can I not get by this?
[268:40.31]Get the fuck away from me and my horse!
[268:42.23]Alright, let's go.
[269:17.82]Made it.
[269:18.12]Ball bending.
[269:20.02]This is really pretty.
[269:25.92]I'm glad you're doing no-cam chill streams again.
[269:32.52]Yeah, I don't know if I would qualify this one as that, though.
[269:36.88]I feel like this got a little unhinged in the last couple hours, I want to say.
[269:42.18]But I agree with you.
[269:42.94]I do agree with you.
[270:06.49]Ice.
[270:10.46]Deep freeze!
[270:11.42]Someone's up here.
[270:26.29]I think I already... Yeah, I already was here.
[270:31.93]Whoa.
[270:45.48]We good?
[270:47.82]Imagine seeing that.
[270:48.72]It'd be like, whoa, shit.
[270:50.22]That person almost just fell off.
[270:51.20]That person's drunk up here.
[270:57.56]Not this girl.
[270:58.50]I'm talking about me.
[271:05.12]Hmm?
[271:07.66]He thinks I'm gonna forgive him for this.
[271:09.34]He's got another thing coming.
[271:29.78]I think I did most of everything here.
[271:32.20]Unless I don't know what's up there.
[271:35.17]Play all the Final Fantasies.
[271:41.45]Nah, I'm really not into those games.
[271:54.68]Let's try to go up there.
[272:04.59]Honestly, the only turn-based RPGs I really ever liked were the Chrono series.
[272:11.87]Chrono Trigger, Mario RPG.
[272:14.03]Another person.
[272:31.55]Is that a grenade?
[272:36.87]You okay?
[272:39.05]Go live.
[272:49.56]By the goddess, I'm grateful.
[272:59.74]Should I go back to that stable?
[273:02.69]Maybe I can collect a reward or something.
[273:21.86]Just threw a barrel at me.
[273:37.11]Play Roblox?
[273:38.87]April 5th, we're having a birthday party for... I don't even know who it is.
[273:41.97]I just know we're having one.
[273:46.94]Are you coming to the birthday party?
[273:48.38]You're invited.
[273:48.82]It's on twitch.tv/Jerma985.
[273:52.22]That's what I heard.
[274:17.31]What the fuck?
[274:18.71]Oh my god.
[274:19.96]Don't do that.
[274:20.76]I thought there was somebody in the room with me or something.
[274:24.56]I don't know.
[274:24.82]I just felt like somebody was in my house or something.
[274:26.50]You know what I mean?
[274:27.06]Like, someone's in my room.
[274:30.23]It's just jarring.
[274:44.16]I'm just sitting here hanging out playing.
[274:45.54]She's like, hey, just wanted to let you know.
[274:46.84]I'll stick with this.
[275:14.19]It's a long way.
[275:18.41]Don't.
[275:19.63]Oh my God.
[275:20.79]It was a scary.
[275:26.98]Hey, can I have a Minecraft themed birthday party?
[275:29.28]It's May 13th.
[275:32.68]No, sorry.
[275:34.10]We're going to get through everybody's birthday on the 5th.
[275:42.97]That's a chest.
[275:58.51]What about Splatoon birthday?
[276:04.03]No, we'll do a Roblox birthday on the 5th.
[276:11.07]So what was in here?
[276:11.79]A lot of work for five fire arrows.
[276:33.74]I don't want to go too far.
[276:57.57]Oh, my God.
[276:58.29]What are you?
[276:58.85]What am I doing?
[276:59.75]What is going on right now?
[277:02.61]I didn't want to use my weapons because I've been breaking them.
[277:05.46]I broke like three in the last 10 minutes.
[277:07.86]And I was afraid to use them.
[277:11.74]What is going on with my brain at the moment?
[277:17.80]I don't want to break all my cool weapons.
[277:19.36]So I'm like, I'll pick up the rock.
[277:21.40]And then that's all I remembered.
[277:24.74]I just woke up a second ago.
[277:26.06]That's all I remember.
[277:47.38]How do they not see me?
[277:48.78]What?
[277:51.19]They don't- They didn't see me.
[277:54.73]What just happened?
[277:55.45]I had an ice arrow.
[277:56.77]What- Okay.
[278:01.65]That was so confusing.
[278:03.86]Ow.
[278:04.98]Alright.
[278:06.06]Hold on.
[278:11.14]Get the- Get the bow out.
[278:13.06]Hold left.
[278:14.50]Press right.
[278:15.74]Let go.
[278:25.75]I wish I could put arrows on without having to be zoomed the fuck in.
[278:29.01]It's annoying.
[278:56.22]I want to put a weapon on What the hell?
[279:03.99]That's a lot of health
[279:23.31]Jesus.
[279:24.59]Okay.
[279:26.31]What do I get for this?
[279:29.23]Ooh.
[279:56.40]Sounded like that came from a bathroom.
[280:14.08]Give me my trinket.
[280:25.56]Change the bow?
[280:37.83]Did I not kill everything?
[280:39.83]Usually you kill everything and something spawns, right?
[280:52.53]Hmm.
[280:54.76]Somebody's still alive?
[280:56.47]No chest.
[281:32.57]Alright, just need to go this way.
[281:50.98]Hey!
[281:51.42]Who are you?
[282:03.15]Mm-hmm.
[282:09.11]Okay.
[282:10.17]My partner, that's to say, my horse ran off.
[282:12.13]And hey, since I've been stranded here... I need a horse to continue my travels.
[282:20.18]If I just had a horse.
[282:23.08]Does he want my horse?
[282:25.38]No.
[282:29.10]No.
[282:44.68]The brightness I don't think is the... There's nothing on OBS.
[282:50.14]I don't have any filters on or anything.
[283:09.31]It's a radiant glow.
[283:17.40]This is not normal.
[283:21.74]This is what I see through my screen too.
[283:23.20]Is HDR on?
[283:26.34]I don't think so.
[283:27.57]It's like I just went through the windshield of a car.
[283:56.05]Oh!
[283:58.37]Where?
[283:58.73]Holy shit.
[284:12.00]I can't see anything.
[284:13.60]Oh my god.
[284:18.50]Is it over here?
[284:19.36]This is kind of ridiculous.
[284:29.25]Is it in your game settings?
[284:30.85]I don't think so guys.
[284:39.73]No, I don't think so.
[284:46.34]There it is.
[284:46.90]Oh my God.
[284:48.30]What about your S you need to buy a new switch.
[284:53.32]Hold on.
[284:53.84]What?
[284:54.12]Let me look at my, you don't go to my switch settings.
[285:04.27]Hold on a second.
[285:09.30]Screen brightness.
[285:12.50]Screen brightness cannot be set while connected to a TV.
[285:19.46]Look.
[285:28.71]I can't change it.
[285:35.29]That's kind of weird.
[285:40.91]I don't think I can do anything else with this.
[285:44.95]That's the switch.
[285:53.16]That's the actual switch brightness.
[285:58.56]The screen on handheld mode.
[286:03.29]That's funny.
[286:16.40]No, it's not OBS.
[286:19.58]Because I have to capture the console.
[286:24.57]Let me go to like my actual property properties.
[286:26.57]Let me see.
[286:31.89]Hold on.
[286:37.27]What if I do this?
[286:37.91]Did that fix it?
[286:42.49]Is it better?
[286:51.70]Maybe a little.
[286:52.25]Yeah, I dropped my... I went into the actual capture card and I dropped the brightness.
[287:05.38]It still is kind of... It still is kind of crazy, though.
[287:26.69]13k versus 17k earlier.
[287:28.17]Oh, my stream crashed.
[287:29.95]A lot of times people just don't come back.
[287:32.19]Which I get it.
[287:32.69]Alright, what do we do here?
[287:55.74]On the move.
[288:01.46]We'll turn this on for now.
[288:06.28]Am I?
[288:06.50]You're going to see my reactions when I. Fuck it up.
[288:29.65]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[288:30.53]Time.
[288:30.73]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[288:32.23]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[288:33.53]Are we doing another one of these?
[288:34.61]10 minutes?
[288:38.15]Are we doing a bet here?
[288:45.35]Okay.
[288:47.51]Will I beat this in 10 minutes?
[288:49.13]By the way, I will, when you say go, I will wait 10 seconds.
[288:57.74]I think that's fair.
[289:07.88]Okay.
[289:09.28]Ready?
[289:11.08]Three, two, one.
[289:13.48]Go.
[289:14.38]Okay.
[289:54.42]Oh, I'm deaf.
[290:09.91]There's no way I don't do this.
[290:12.04]All the doubters.
[290:12.88]I'm sorry, but you're about to get wiped out.
[290:54.11]I want it.
[290:54.81]Good.
[290:57.23]Okay, let's keep going.
[292:06.86]Son of a gun What are you
[292:48.25]Wait... Did that actually work?
[293:27.57]Whoa!
[293:28.37]Whoa!
[293:28.79]It's coming from this side.
[293:29.99]It's coming from this side.
[293:31.19]Do I have time?
[293:59.45]Time check.
[294:10.71]I got five minutes.
[294:13.51]I'm just gonna get up and start Fortnite dancing.
[294:20.75]Hey, all the believers from earlier that lost everything, hope you got it all back.
[294:27.98]Sorry, doubters.
[294:30.52]That's the way it is.
[294:45.59]This is my favorite part about the whole game.
[294:55.55]I have six orbs now.
[294:58.31]Which... Lost everything?
[295:00.92]Why do you look so fucked up?
[295:07.00]I don't know.
[295:08.72]I don't know.
[295:16.76]Just chillin', man.
[295:21.19]Very cool.
[295:22.03]So let's keep going over here.
[295:48.30]What's wrong?
[296:24.61]These need to explode.
[296:28.35]Get out of the way.
[296:28.97]Somebody move.
[296:29.45]I thought I was going to drop the lantern.
[296:50.76]Get out of here.
[296:57.98]Oh!
[297:10.74]Holy shit!
[297:11.82]What is hurting me so much right now?
[297:15.12]I'm taking like times five damage.
[297:21.48]Why am I getting hurt so bad?
[297:25.62]Out of food almost.
[297:36.64]Fire burning you?
[297:37.42]How about now?
[297:46.88]Yes!
[298:10.29]in the chest.
[298:15.98]Let's replace this one.
[298:21.12]Or... Is it time to get rid of one of these?
[298:25.28]What do you think?
[298:32.54]Maybe get rid of the lizard shield?
[298:41.50]This thing just seems way better.
[298:42.88]Ooh.
[298:51.47]Alright, let's light this thing up.
[299:11.77]Jerma TWT thinks you look handsome today.
[299:33.45]Oh, Twitter.
[299:34.99]T... I was like, what is T... I thought that was like some imposter channel or something.
[299:39.29]Like, oh, hey, JermaTWT is streaming right now.
[299:42.09]And, oh, he said you look pretty good today.
[299:45.01]What?
[299:54.23]Oh, my God.
[299:54.91]I'm so sorry.
[299:55.57]Wait, come back.
[299:56.71]Come back.
[299:57.92]Come back.
[299:58.62]I'm sorry.
[299:59.18]I didn't mean to.
[300:01.70]I'm so sorry.
[300:15.42]Going through his bones?
[300:17.72]Guys.
[300:19.80]He's going through his bones.
[300:39.50]Oh, that hurts so bad.
[300:40.74]That was... I need to relax.
[300:50.33]Jeez, man.
[301:04.66]And.
[301:05.04]Spoils.
[301:07.68]No.
[301:34.12]Maybe something hidden in here?
[301:40.13]Can you just admit that you hate this game?
[301:53.85]I don't think that's accurate.
[302:26.96]I think I'm just 40.
[302:27.78]I need to get some food now.
[302:44.97]I don't want to waste all this good shit I have.
[302:46.67]A lot of this is high level, high level, mid level.
[302:57.85]I need a town or something.
[302:58.85]Hmm, what should I eat?
[303:05.75]Whatever, I can cook more food.
[303:06.79]It's fine.
[303:17.42]Canyon.
[303:19.36]Shrine?
[303:21.99]Shrine?
[303:28.29]Which way?
[303:36.13]In the water?
[303:38.21]Tremor, do you have anything to say to your haters?
[303:40.96]No?
[303:48.22]Whoa!
[304:05.83]Don't do this to us.
[304:18.76]No one's under any obligation to like this channel.
[304:21.52]If you don't like this channel, then alright.
[304:24.74]It's on you.
[304:25.32]It's up to you.
[304:28.35]And this is... I'm so glad I had that.
[304:30.53]What?
[304:30.93]That's weird.
[304:48.33]I mean, if you go, hey, this guy's a dickhead, and then leave, then... Alright, well.
[305:01.01]Oh dear, hold on.
[305:01.93]Where's the shrine?
[305:02.85]Under the bridge?
[305:31.73]There it is.
[305:47.71]Oh, no.
[305:49.03]Wait, I think I'm OK.
[306:12.46]Oh, pretty good cartoon laugh.
[306:14.18]That was a pretty good cartoon character.
[306:18.96]I'm just running around with a bowl of cereal in my hands.
[306:21.56]It's like, there's children running after me and I have a bowl of cereal running around.
[306:45.86]You guys want to bet?
[306:46.36]How you guys doing on the betting?
[306:48.50]No, it's a test of strength.
[306:49.33]Never mind.
[306:49.63]I'll do this pretty quickly.
[306:50.81]They're magically delicious.
[307:09.22]Yeah.
[307:27.36]Don't even give him a chance.
[307:28.80]I have some junk that I can get rid of, don't I?
[307:44.01]Yeah, this is crap.
[307:56.37]in here I should probably go upgrade the slate right can people still not write the word though
[308:27.49]We cannot.
[308:32.11]Oh.
[308:42.22]Well, you guys have had to communicate in symbols all day anyways.
[308:56.91]This is a really funny prank.
[308:59.49]It's so funny, I'm laughing.
[309:02.98]Alright, you can take it off.
[309:09.92]Give them their freedom back.
[309:11.08]Give them all the words back.
[309:18.36]Very nice.
[309:19.38]Alright.
[309:19.72]I need to get back up.
[309:26.94]So you could probably just go from here and just jump off.
[309:44.00]What was the point of that?
[309:44.84]Because it's the funny day and I wanted to make chatting unbearable, I guess, for some reason.
[309:56.86]I don't know.
[310:02.28]Okay, so how do I get back there quickly?
[310:06.43]I can just climb this.
[310:07.19]Okay.
[310:25.79]I think that's just you being a prick.
[310:31.36]Is it really though?
[310:32.28]It's for like four hours in one day in April.
[310:35.80]Where's the horse?
[310:48.51]Okay.
[311:07.93]Yeah, but you were a prick for four hours.
[311:15.08]I guess that doesn't change the fact that I was a dick for a few hours.
[311:18.48]That's right.
[311:19.22]Yeah, that's true.
[311:21.38]I don't think I want to fight this.
[311:27.04]I'll be honest, I didn't even know it was still on.
[311:28.68]I was too busy being angry at Zelda.
[312:00.76]Holy shit.
[312:07.38]Oh my goodness.
[312:12.90]I just annihilated this guy.
[312:19.63]This theme song didn't even get to play.
[312:28.03]Oh.
[312:35.63]Can't hear any more of these.
[312:40.11]Ooh, wait a minute.
[312:59.78]Wait, what was the bow?
[313:00.46]I don't know if I want to drop.
[313:09.32]Should I drop the golden bow?
[313:10.22]I don't think anything I want to drop here.
[313:25.71]Just soldier's bow?
[313:26.69]Nah.
[313:29.81]Nah, we're good.
[313:30.45]Another one?
[313:52.57]Really?
[313:53.51]Okay, where?
[314:11.06]I'm not picking up the signal anymore.
[314:12.36]Where is it?
[314:19.08]I need a tower.
[314:50.65]tower over there.
[314:51.23]That's really close to Ganon, though.
[314:53.37]Ooh, a stable.
[315:12.26]No, I want Frank too to be teleported here.
[315:19.35]Yeah, I'll get food too.
[315:41.60]But first, I want to do this shrine, because then I will have the right amount of hearts to get the Master Sword.
[315:51.01]That's correct, right?
[316:02.68]There it is.
[316:14.59]Yellow hearts don't count.
[316:16.99]How many do I have?
[316:17.41]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[316:17.69]I'll have 13.
[316:18.00]I'll have 8 orbs.
[316:18.64]I'll have 13 after this.
[316:45.24]Make it look like a rave is going on in your cam?
[316:47.10]I don't have any lights in here that could do that.
[316:52.38]I'm sorry to say.
[316:53.17]Are we voting?
[317:19.66]10 minutes.
[317:21.26]Let's see if I can do it.
[317:26.54]I'll pause it so I'm not looking.
[317:40.56]Timer is ready.
[318:02.00]OK.
[318:05.78]In.
[318:05.98]3.
[318:06.00]2.
[318:06.02]1.
[318:08.91]Alright, first of all.
[318:24.58]Something to do with this, I bet.
[318:33.03]Yep.
[318:33.95]Okay.
[318:37.07]Yep.
[318:47.34]Ball up there.
[318:48.00]Hmm.
[318:53.95]What is this?
[319:07.34]Oh shit, hold on.
[319:13.19]Ball.
[319:23.02]Ball goes over here.
[319:58.75]Could've worked.
[320:30.56]Why would I be able to do that though?
[320:32.48]Should I climb?
[320:34.17]Wait, can I get up here?
[320:35.25]I thought it was too shallow.
[321:02.70]Okay.
[321:05.80]Uh, I know what to do.
[321:49.48]Fuck!
[321:49.94]It goes the other way.
[321:51.69]It goes the other way.
[321:53.61]I need arrows, dude.
[321:54.73]How am I supposed to do this without arrows?
[322:06.12]How do I get that back?
[322:25.64]It goes down.
[322:28.84]Flip it again, hold on.
[322:33.32]Okay, so... Now I throw it in here.
[322:37.88]Fuck you!
[322:42.20]God damn it!
[322:43.38]I wasn't close enough.
[322:44.38]How was I not close enough?
[322:54.43]Now, how am I going to get this out of the water?
[323:13.49]There, OK, sorry, it wasn't for.
[323:15.07]Oh my God, this game.
[323:31.74]Let me out of here.
[323:32.26]OK, so what?
[323:59.76]Me me.
[324:38.05]Actually, this is like a bomb or something.
[324:51.04]How do I get that to move?
[325:13.59]I can't select it or I can't do anything with it.
[325:15.65]Magnetism doesn't do anything.
[325:20.01]Stasis doesn't do anything.
[325:21.15]Whatever it is.
[325:21.63]I keep forgetting I own these things.
[325:35.77]I really do.
[325:36.83]Did that not do anything?
[325:55.03]That doesn't do it.
[325:57.69]What am I doing here?
[325:58.57]Dude, I'm stumped.
[326:15.79]I don't get it.
[326:17.95]What does it want me to do?
[326:27.86]What?
[326:31.14]What just happened?
[326:36.39]Wait, it turns the whole thing.
[326:38.53]Wait a minute.
[326:39.13]Hold on.
[326:39.83]What?
[326:42.25]What?
[326:43.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[326:44.25]Turn it back around.
[326:45.01]I'm so confused right now.
[326:46.05]I don't have any arrows.
[326:48.21]I don't want to shoot an ancient arrow.
[327:02.88]What if I get arrows?
[327:07.84]This thing's an ancient arrow.
[327:09.14]It's worth a lot.
[327:10.16]Okay, well then, can I... There's nothing at the end of this.
[327:30.65]I'm dead.
[327:33.67]I'm dead.
[327:35.33]GG doubters.
[327:45.85]I can't.
[327:46.15]I physically can't get over there again because I don't have any arrows.
[327:48.75]Are you kidding me?
[328:01.22]That can't be right.
[328:10.65]That can't be right.
[328:11.49]It actually can't be.
[328:12.21]Alright, now what?
[328:32.59]Open.
[328:33.03]I have to... Oh!
[328:35.05]Oh!
[328:35.79]Oh my god!
[328:36.65]I didn't even know that was a keyhole, guys.
[328:38.61]I didn't know that was a keyhole.
[328:40.98]I didn't know that was a keyhole.
[328:48.91]Oh my god.
[328:49.71]I honestly just did not... That was not a keyhole to me.
[328:54.79]Oh my goodness.
[328:55.61]You gotta be kidding me.
[328:57.67]Okay.
[329:02.52]I picked up so many keys in Resident Evil 4 that they just became like, oh, whatever.
[329:05.90]You got a key.
[329:06.40]Who cares?
[329:08.86]I still don't know what to do.
[329:14.25]Jump from here over Okay to jump over Okay, alright, that's fun I
[329:44.00]GG.
[329:45.54]Congratulations, doubters.
[329:47.02]You definitely won.
[330:03.31]GG, doubters.
[330:03.99]Because I still can't piece together what the hell I do here.
[330:09.01]Why am I hitting the ceiling, by the way?
[330:10.39]I shouldn't be.
[330:24.82]It's not that simple, right?
[330:30.45]Where am I even going?
[330:32.85]Where's the goal?
[330:36.91]I actually don't know where the goal of this shrine is.
[330:39.89]It's not up top, right?
[330:56.09]Oh my god, it's over there.
[331:00.23]What is the point of that fucking thing?
[331:03.06]What is the point of that square?
[331:05.22]Why is that there?
[331:05.94]It doesn't even help me at all.
[331:25.78]I'm done with this fucking place.
[331:28.68]Didn't work.
[331:44.55]Doesn't even help me though.
[332:10.99]I don't fucking understand this.
[332:22.35]I don't get it.
[332:27.54]It only launches you so far.
[332:46.33]Ooh.
[332:49.28]I don't get it.
[333:12.44]How do I go higher up over the edge?
[333:31.20]Wait, does this move all... Does this move everything?
[333:34.08]Yeah, but I don't have any arrows.
[333:44.85]How am I... How am I supposed to do this without arrows?
[333:50.93]Okay.
[334:00.47]Throw a bomb over there?
[334:02.27]Can I even reach it?
[334:04.86]Huh?
[334:41.59]Come on, man.
[334:42.57]That's just like, that's so particular.
[334:44.96]That's so particular.
[334:47.12]That's particular.
[335:06.36]That was a 7x payout.
[335:09.08]Well.
[335:12.96]You just made a doubter out of me?
[335:15.18]Eh, but next time you're going to bet against me and I'm going to win and you're going to feel just as bad.
[335:18.40]Alright, let's go upgrade.
[335:32.11]And then I'm going to pull that sword out of the ground.
[335:41.77]Is there one of those little shrines in here?
[335:47.41]What's going on?
[335:47.93]Oh.
[336:00.46]The arrow would have made it easier.
[336:18.65]Your view count probably dropped because the words if and though were banned.
[336:24.21]No, they were banned for hours before the stream crashed.
[336:31.64]I'm sorry.
[336:33.62]I think that's just so stupid.
[336:37.54]What a strict community.
[336:40.82]Oh, hey, I'm a new viewer.
[336:43.35]Do you think that I could... I'm trying to think of a sentence with the...
[336:50.04]This is this is the game for the switch that I like band.
[336:54.29]Oh What did I say?
[336:55.63]Oh?
[336:56.99]Fuck this guy Hey, if you go up there, I think deleted what?
[337:01.43]This guy sucks It wasn't timing anybody out
[337:18.76]Alright, where is this thing?
[337:19.82]It's in here, isn't it?
[337:30.56]Timed out for saying if.
[337:32.04]Framerate Forest.
[337:37.83]Yeah, where's the... I have to go inside of this thing.
[337:44.67]Where's the entrance?
[337:54.69]And it's right here.
[337:55.91]So I need health twice.
[337:58.60]My voice sucks.
[338:02.52]We should do a secret word of the day.
[338:03.90]If you say it, you get a 24 hour timeout.
[338:07.32]Okay.
[338:08.65]Well, no, I like you just, you just win.
[338:14.79]Yeah, alright.
[338:15.69]So if you get timed out for saying this word, then you... Oh, you just win.
[338:24.22]You don't win anything.
[338:24.78]You just win, and everyone goes, wow, you did it.
[338:26.58]Alright.
[338:31.96]I gotta think of a word that people are just gonna spam words and then get it immediately.
[338:37.80]And it has to be a word in the dictionary.
[338:39.23]It's not gonna be a made-up word.
[338:43.48]Uh, so in the mod chat, I'm gonna type a word, put that on the list that times you out, whatever, and whoever gets actually timed up for saying it wins the game.
[338:56.21]Who the fuck is gonna write this?
[339:01.23]No one's gonna write that word.
[339:02.99]There's no way.
[339:04.27]That's literally not fucking going to happen.
[339:08.63]Tell me if somebody wins.
[339:37.88]Why would it be Peter Griffin?
[339:46.62]Wait, we won't see it because it'll just get blocked.
[339:56.55]Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean.
[340:05.35]Your chat is just going to look like bots.
[340:13.23]I'll give you some hints.
[340:14.97]You have to say every word in the dictionary.
[340:20.30]I'll give you a hint.
[340:27.04]The hint is... Oh, it's not enabled yet.
[340:37.99]In the meantime, I'm ready to pull this out.
[341:29.03]Your master will come for you.
[341:31.95]Until then, you shall rest safely here.
[341:36.91]Although this slumber of restoration will most certainly deprive him of his memories, please trust me when I say that I know he will arrive before you yet again.
[341:51.05]If I may be so bold, what is it that you are planning to do next, Princess?
[341:59.97]This thing talks?
[342:01.05]Oh, no, it doesn't.
[342:04.64]The Master Sword.
[342:05.78]I heard it speak to me.
[342:09.82]It seems that my role is unfinished.
[342:12.68]There is still something I must do.
[342:14.44]I sense there is great strength in your dedication.
[342:20.30]Great Deku Tree, I ask of you.
[342:25.67]When he returns, can you please relay this message?
[342:29.96]What was the word?
[342:31.20]Guys, there was no word.
[342:32.45]Then there never was a word.
[342:34.83]Alright, here's the hint.
[342:37.51]Steam.
[342:37.63]STEAM.
[343:16.81]Nobody got it.
[343:20.11]Yes.
[343:20.45]Steam.
[343:21.81]Hot.
[343:24.55]Forceful.
[343:31.57]Magnificent.
[343:35.86]Somebody got it.
[343:36.44]Somebody got it.
[343:36.94]Somebody got it.
[343:37.42]Somebody got it.
[343:37.84]Who got it?
[343:40.35]Somebody got it.
[343:40.79]It was Geyser.
[343:42.36]Nice job.
[343:42.98]What you just saw happened where you stand 100 years ago.
[343:47.86]It was Joshy.
[343:49.82]Hey, Joshy.
[343:51.10]After you were separated from the sword, the princess thought to bring it here where she knew that it would be safe under my watch.
[344:03.95]She continues to fight.
[344:05.75]That was a dumbass word for real.
[344:08.47]It was a hard one.
[344:09.53]You never would have guessed that.
[344:12.35]Her heart cascades with faith that you will return.
[344:19.61]She has a smile like the sun.
[344:23.26]I would do much to feel its warmth upon me once again.
[344:27.94]Want to do another one?
[344:32.78]Okay, let's do another one.
[344:45.09]Okay.
[344:47.65]I got another one.
[344:50.07]This thing only does 30 damage?
[345:07.28]Okay.
[345:12.44]So don't use it until the end of the game.
[345:26.68]Alright, I did this stupid thing.
[345:28.10]How do I make it so I don't throw it?
[345:37.90]It doesn't break.
[345:39.10]Oh, it doesn't break!
[345:41.85]You can throw it.
[345:42.73]Really?
[345:42.99]Whoa!
[345:50.80]Oh, it does that at full health, right?
[345:52.66]That's really cool.
[345:57.14]Okay, the game is on.
[345:58.18]There's a new word.
[346:01.56]Luck.
[346:09.92]I'll give you a good hint.
[346:11.52]Uh, the hint is... It's a food.
[346:15.57]This is a food.
[346:19.73]It's delicious.
[346:23.26]Hot.
[346:24.88]Steam.
[346:26.30]Forceful.
[346:28.60]Steam.
[346:29.54]Hot.
[346:40.11]You could even call it geyser-like.
[346:41.61]Somebody got it, Fajita?
[346:44.81]Nice job.
[346:55.69]That was by Daisy.
[346:56.83]Nice job, Daisy.
[346:59.85]You're now ready to test the limits of your courage.
[347:04.65]At the place where you reunited with the Master Sword.
[347:07.00]Are you going to wait until I leave to tell me this?
[347:23.42]Very cool.
[347:30.35]So this thing never breaks.
[347:31.31]That's DLC.
[347:37.86]Okay, I'll do it maybe another time.
[347:39.68]Alright, we'll do one more word.
[347:43.20]I'm going to give to the mods.
[348:01.76]It runs out of charge and you can't use it for 30 minutes.
[348:03.64]Okay, that's good enough.
[348:08.24]Okay, a new word.
[348:10.52]Okay.
[348:24.41]Your hint for this one.
[348:31.11]Hmm, how do I do a hint for this one, though, giving it away?
[348:43.79]Forceful.
[348:47.47]That's true.
[348:57.24]I wonder if somebody gets it without me even saying it.
[348:58.94]Wait, somebody already got it?
[349:01.89]Somebody got it.
[349:03.35]Who got it?
[349:03.91]I didn't even say anything.
[349:04.93]A lot of you guys are getting fucking timed out.
[349:17.66]Did somebody get it?
[349:30.50]What was the word?
[349:31.66]Wait, I need to get it confirmed.
[349:33.28]Did anybody get it?
[349:33.94]Oh, OK.
[349:41.78]Fast.
[349:49.47]Blade.
[349:53.35]Blade.
[350:03.67]No.
[350:10.91]That's pretty much all I can say to you.
[350:14.14]Fast blade.
[350:15.26]Spin.
[350:20.52]Spin.
[350:22.42]Spin.
[350:22.82]Nice.
[350:23.78]Already got it.
[350:38.43]uh that was ev sprinkle helicopter this next one is a phrase oh my god I'm driving the horse off into the water this next one's gonna be a phrase this is four words
[351:23.19]Um, oh.
[351:25.33]It's four words.
[351:27.11]It has to do with what you are seeing right now.
[351:29.93]Somebody already won it?
[351:43.48]Alright, well, I don't know what the hell I did here, but I'm gonna have to call the horse at a different stable.
[351:57.66]Just go back to this.
[351:58.32]Just get it.
[351:58.84]Go back and get it.
[352:05.53]That one got it yet?
[352:06.09]Alright, here's the hint.
[352:10.59]Well, okay.
[352:11.41]Alright.
[352:15.46]Alright.
[352:37.94]You got it, but you haven't said the right exact phrase yet.
[352:49.70]Sorry, I'll do it.
[352:51.22]The stream is over.
[352:55.08]It's the end of the stream.
[352:58.82]Oh, somebody got it.
[353:01.32]Gabe Bud.
[353:10.18]But it's not quite over, not yet.
[353:12.04]Give me another few minutes.
[353:13.12]I want to get up to the next town.
[353:24.35]Bang a right.
[353:29.17]What was the phrase?
[353:29.93]The phrase was the stream is over.
[353:31.67]I'm ending the stream in about 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
[353:48.50]So I've got one more Divine Beast.
[353:51.70]And then Calamity Ganon, right?
[353:56.32]And then a bunch of side content, obviously.
[353:58.17]That was fun.
[354:11.31]Gonna do more side quests?
[354:12.33]Yeah, oh yeah.
[354:19.68]How did I turn around?
[354:20.88]I'm so confused.
[354:23.70]How did I turn around in a circle?
[354:25.58]Let's do the secret word game next time.
[354:34.59]I gotta think of some good twists for it.
[355:10.07]Hmm or a tower when I get a tower in the den I Don't see a tower anywhere
[355:53.59]Kind of weird to be all the way out here and not have a single tower or anything.
[355:58.44]Over there?
[356:01.86]Okay, there's one over there.
[356:38.28]I'll get this one.
[356:45.95]Sing, please.
[356:46.63]My whole family is here.
[356:49.67]Your whole family is in the room.
[356:56.63]Like even like grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, your whole family's in the room.
[357:08.52]Alright, yeah, of course, I'll sing to your whole family.
[357:15.06]Hey, everybody, welcome to the stream!
[357:18.54]See, right now, you just fucking panicked and fumbled around desperately trying to grab the remote to turn me down.
[357:25.41]Because you're like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[357:27.43]It's so embarrassing that you just had to show that to your whole family.
[357:30.55]Don't ever ask me for anything like that again.
[357:48.25]When you watched this guy, it was annoying.
[357:51.52]I fucking hated that.
[357:52.62]What was it, Grandma?
[357:56.10]You pissed off Grandma?
[358:06.17]Ooh.
[358:07.47]That's probably easier to get.
[358:36.85]Uh, it's been a wacky day today.
[358:39.48]Oh boy.
[359:24.05]you actually got me what the hell is happening why is there more than one
[359:53.74]Oh no!

[359:57.08]Just because there's a tr- What happened to the hor- How do I revive the horse?
[360:09.74]Seriously, how do I revive the horse?
[360:12.99]I killed him.
[360:14.89]No, I didn't, dude.
[360:16.25]He's fine.
[360:21.39]How do I revive the horse?
[360:29.46]god damn it will you leave me alone with this do a fairy revive do I have one of those there is a way to revive okay thank god
[361:05.99]Oh, no.

[361:44.86]Power of the laser, you'll be fine.
[361:50.15]Go.
[362:46.82]Okay.
[363:08.47]Will the next stream be chill?
[363:10.33]Yes.
[363:12.19]I feel like there's too many goofy things happening today for it to be a proper chill stream.
[363:20.12]Too many goofy things happen.
[363:31.05]There we are.
[363:35.01]Okay.
[363:44.98]Yeah, Grotto Beasts should be shipping really soon here.
[363:47.90]I've seen people talking about it.
[363:51.58]Keep an eye on your tracking if you have one.
[363:55.38]We're incredibly excited to see what people have to say.
[363:58.65]Yeah, we'll do a real chill stream.
[364:02.99]I'm going to slow it down a little bit next time.
[364:06.01]I don't know.
[364:06.61]There was something in the fucking water tonight.
[364:08.23]I was just all over the place.
[364:09.81]It was fun, though.
[364:12.05]It was really fun.
[364:15.97]I will revive Frank too.
[364:17.87]The next time you see me stream, I'm going to play this again.
[364:21.83]I'm going to try to beat Breath of the Wild over the next few days.
[364:29.20]So I will see you all on Monday.
[364:34.49]Monday at 6pm.
[364:39.67]Happy April Fools.
[364:43.63]I didn't really do very much besides make it so you can't talk that much.
[364:48.13]Which, oops.
[364:50.23]That was fun.
[364:50.57]I had a good time.
[364:52.31]Hopefully it was fun to watch.
[364:53.07]Because it's fun to play.
[364:58.25]As good or as bad as I am at the game, that's fine.
[365:03.07]We will slow it down.
[365:04.17]I will chill out next stream.
[365:08.83]But that's going to be it.
[365:11.74]See you guys on Monday.
[365:16.19]Take care of yourselves.
[365:21.77]Seadog had a massive raid.
[365:25.15]If you're still here from Connor's stream.
[365:28.12]Cool.
[365:39.48]Yeah, we'll do some proper exploring.
[365:41.02]I'm not just going to run to the next Divine Beast.
[365:45.66]There's a whole area that I want to go take a look at.
[365:49.62]So we're not going to sprint through the game.
[365:54.76]I'm thinking I'll try to get it done in the next.
[365:59.94]Two or three streams, maybe another two or three streams of this will probably do it.
[366:06.37]Like another 15 hours or so.
[366:08.85]That's probably seems like accurate amount of time.
[366:16.31]We'll see.
[366:19.27]What about April 5th?
[366:20.25]Well, that's the Roblox birthday party.
[366:24.42]So, we can take a pause on this for a little bit.
[366:45.11]Yeah, have a great night.
[366:47.27]Have a good rest of your weekend.
[366:48.15]I'm sorry I was a little unhinged today, but I had fun.
[366:58.96]I still can't believe people could not write the for the first four hours of the stream.
[367:05.70]You guys were super, super creative with though.
[367:09.93]I didn't even notice.
[367:10.73]I did not even notice.
[367:22.77]was a lot of TH3s.
[367:25.15]That's why they were writing that.
[367:28.35]Everybody was writing that.
[367:29.39]That's right.
[367:29.99]I was wondering for a second.
[367:31.26]After the first 20 minutes, I was like, oh, that's a funny joke.
[367:33.40]We just never turned it off.
[367:35.14]I was like, why are people doing TH3?
[367:39.91]What's going on?
[367:54.37]Adapt and overcome.
[367:57.73]Alright.
[367:58.91]I'll see you guys, uh, day after tomorrow.
[368:02.40]Well, tomorrow for some of you, but... Take care of yourselves.
[368:09.12]Call your mother.
[368:09.58]Thanks for watching.
[368:14.42]It's a good time to stop, too.
[368:15.38]Midnight.
[368:15.66]I don't want to go too much longer.
[368:21.36]More Breath of the Wild.
[368:24.48]Goodnight.
[368:25.04]Goodbye.
[368:25.72]See you soon.
