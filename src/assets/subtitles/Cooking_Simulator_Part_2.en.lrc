[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.27]Okay.
[00:03.11]I am back.
[00:03.77]So we're going to hang out, I believe... When's the Bethesda conference?
[00:12.63]It's in like an hour, right?
[00:17.05]4 p.m.
[00:18.31]Pacific?
[00:21.89]So in like two hours?
[00:22.73]Okay.
[00:25.57]So I'm going to play Cooking Simulator.
[00:27.69]We're going to pick up right where I left off.
[00:30.67]In the meantime.
[00:31.51]And then we're going to do the Bethesda conference.
[00:35.55]And then that's probably, I don't think I'm going to do Devolver.
[00:38.84]Because Devolver every year kind of has, it's not necessarily a live conference, right?
[00:44.94]It's kind of like an edited video.
[00:51.43]They do like a little special thing, right?
[00:54.91]But I'll be back tomorrow for Square Enix and... What's the other one?
[01:00.70]What the hell is they doing?
[01:08.42]Ubisoft, right.
[01:09.74]We'll do that tomorrow as well.
[01:12.22]Let's get Cooking Simulator open while we just chill.
[01:14.54]By the way, remind me when we're like 10 minutes out.
[01:17.69]Because I will forget.
[01:19.73]And I will be late to the conference.
[01:27.24]Let's get it open.
[01:32.55]You should see it on the screen.
[01:35.27]Very shortly.
[01:37.61]Like as in right now.
[01:44.71]Hey, there it is.
[01:50.08]No one tell him anything.
[01:52.32]You have to remind me.
[01:53.28]I'm not going to be able to remember.
[02:03.30]Are we still doing the floor soup?
[02:05.36]Yes.
[02:12.18]Corporate?
[02:12.66]What do you mean corporate streamer?
[02:14.09]Which is soup yard, right?
[02:17.41]A 12 balance.
[02:19.69]Which one is it?
[02:20.17]This one, right?
[02:29.32]He's not gonna know?
[02:30.28]No, I'm paying attention.
[02:34.81]I got a clock right in front of me.
[02:36.11]Oh, this is loud.
[02:37.03]Hold on.
[02:37.45]Loud, loud, loud, loud, loud.
[02:38.57]There we go.
[02:49.74]That's better.
[02:52.30]It's not as loud now.
[02:55.92]Okay.
[02:57.40]So, for those of you that have no idea what the hell's going on, you're maybe just still hanging out here after the Microsoft conference.
[03:04.88]Uh, this is a soup house.
[03:07.30]And I got, hold on, there's stuff already going on.
[03:09.34]Uh, duck broth already got that made, right?
[03:10.70]Why are there eggs in here?
[03:13.51]Oh, there's oil in there still.
[03:14.55]Why?
[03:14.91]What's going on?
[03:15.51]Alright, here we go.
[03:17.61]The duck is right here.
[03:18.41]I got my duck broth right here.
[03:23.83]And it's just a few pieces of this, right?
[03:32.08]Alright, that's done.
[03:35.82]Floor organization, yeah.
[03:37.32]I pre-made a bunch of this shit.
[03:41.25]Okay, I don't know why it's doing this.
[03:45.43]I just lost fame for that.
[03:48.27]I'm reloading.
[03:49.33]That's bullshit.
[03:50.17]That's absolutely fucking stupid.
[03:56.63]How long till Bethesda?
[03:57.53]Just about two hours.
[03:59.23]I do not deserve that.
[04:01.60]Let's try this again.
[04:04.18]Grab the soup.
[04:06.02]Grab a few pieces of duck.
[04:10.91]Okay.
[04:13.27]Some of the pieces of duck don't stay in.
[04:16.55]I don't know why.
[04:17.21]I can't... I don't know why.
[04:19.05]You get two.
[04:21.73]Can I put three in here?
[04:22.97]Alright, these are all in here.
[04:24.05]They're not moving.
[04:26.16]Go.
[04:29.30]Oh my fucking god.
[04:30.40]I can't do anything about it.
[04:33.82]I can't.
[04:34.24]I'm gonna lose fame every time.
[04:40.66]You saw, I tried.
[04:41.82]I really did.
[04:42.28]Alright, here we go.
[04:43.62]I need to make a pork chop.
[04:45.62]Pork rabbit.
[04:46.10]Do I have one ready?
[04:48.06]I got one of these ready.
[04:51.89]What is it?
[04:53.05]Eight?
[04:53.29]I don't remember.
[04:58.35]It's eight, yeah.
[04:59.97]Eight chive.
[05:01.21]Eight chive.
[05:08.31]There's probably a bunch of people that are just like, what the hell are you doing?
[05:10.75]Why is everything on the floor?
[05:11.71]This game... I just threw it at them.
[05:14.71]What just happened?
[05:15.55]What's going on?
[05:20.28]Did it dump?
[05:23.06]No, it dumped.
[05:24.08]It was forward dumping.
[05:30.62]They didn't patch it.
[05:35.73]This makes no sense.
[05:39.62]They did not patch out the floor soup.
[05:41.86]No way.
[05:42.26]It's only been like two days.
[05:43.41]Okay, hold on.
[05:47.99]I'm gonna start with the pork chops first.
[05:52.79]Pork chop.
[05:53.89]Grab one.
[05:54.37]Get this seasoned up.
[05:58.04]It is four salt, four pepper.
[06:05.86]There is four.
[06:07.29]Salt.
[06:09.76]There's already a pork chop out here, but whatever.
[06:11.82]I can use it later.
[06:15.50]And then it's time, right?
[06:17.84]Six time?
[06:19.84]Yeah.
[06:22.46]If this thing falls off a plate, I'm gonna go play Picross.
[06:30.08]Okay, how much oil do I... There's plenty of oil in the pan already.
[06:33.02]Turn it on.
[06:35.86]Get this cooked up.
[06:36.48]I already have the potatoes ready.
[06:40.15]Alright, that's going.
[06:42.29]Potatoes are already done over here.
[06:43.45]I have my potato section right here.
[06:46.21]They're good.
[06:52.73]And then... Okay, now the duck.
[06:53.90]This should... I don't know why this is not working.
[06:58.90]They definitely did not patch this.
[07:01.40]Somebody go look.
[07:01.94]Are there notes?
[07:06.64]If you have food that's been sitting out for more than four days, does it just disappear?
[07:19.35]Pull it off.
[07:19.79]Okay.
[07:20.45]It's still, it's fine.
[07:23.39]Got it.
[07:24.81]Finally.
[07:26.35]See?
[07:26.59]It's fine.
[07:30.61]That's like a four-star meal.
[07:33.92]Bachelor, I can flip this in a few seconds.
[07:37.46]Gazpacho comes in next.
[07:39.08]No, another duck.
[07:50.64]Some of these pieces just don't stay in.
[07:53.60]That's the issue.
[07:54.20]Okay, this is good too.
[08:04.63]Yeah, the strategy here is the game doesn't really care that much if your food is four or five days old.
[08:12.80]Oh, oh, oh, oh, here we go.
[08:16.90]So I just made a ton of shit in advance.
[08:29.64]Got it, okay.
[08:31.12]Uh, what's next?
[08:33.39]What was it?
[08:34.49]Oh, it's fish, fish, fish, fish, fish.
[08:41.35]That'll be done soon, and I got the plate, and I got the, uh... Alright, trout.
[08:45.38]Uh, I want to get this off.
[08:48.70]Here we go.
[08:49.32]It's, uh, pepper, thyme, dill.
[08:56.10]Oh, almost.
[08:57.55]Pepper, thyme, dill, pepper, thyme, dill, dill, dill, dill, dill.
[09:05.75]Oh shit, that's pepper again.
[09:07.59]What?
[09:08.51]How did I just do that?
[09:10.26]How did I just do that?
[09:11.18]I don't know how I even just did that.
[09:13.80]It's because there's two peppers.
[09:23.17]And it was dill.
[09:25.59]Dill, dill, dill.
[09:26.59]I don't think I even have it out.
[09:29.75]Cayenne.
[09:31.45]Salt.
[09:31.76]What is dill?
[09:35.92]Well, I gotta take this out.
[09:45.14]I need a plate.
[09:46.72]Come here.
[09:57.16]Alright, potatoes.
[10:00.82]Six, right?
[10:01.98]I need to make more of these.
[10:13.56]There's no mold on it.
[10:16.94]That's just spices.
[10:17.74]It's seasoning.
[10:21.25]Alright, now we need to make the trout.
[10:23.01]I have a little to work fast on this one.
[10:25.31]Oh, come on.
[10:29.25]Fine.
[10:29.49]I don't care.
[10:32.85]Oh, this is... I don't have any dill.
[10:41.50]Did I lose the dill?
[10:42.36]Do I actually have to buy dill again?
[10:43.52]Did I throw it away?
[10:44.34]Okay, get this in the oven.
[11:01.83]Come on.
[11:02.77]Get in there.
[11:07.40]No, pick it up!
[11:12.65]Okay, that's gonna cook.
[11:14.15]And then I need, uh, a lemon.
[11:16.89]How's that going?
[11:17.71]That's doing fine.
[11:24.04]Where's my knife?
[11:28.36]I threw it the last time I played.
[11:30.94]Somewhere.
[11:35.37]Shit, this is not good.
[11:37.91]Didn't I throw it out the window?
[11:42.00]I think I threw the knife out the window last time.
[11:47.38]I have no idea.
[11:47.86]I gotta buy one, though.
[11:54.60]Okay, um... Get that cut into fours.
[12:02.13]Good.
[12:02.35]And a plate.
[12:10.87]Which one's gonna be done first?
[12:12.05]I gotta flip that.
[12:12.77]Oh, fuck.
[12:13.77]Where's my spatula?
[12:14.25]Quick, quick, quick, go, go, go, go, go.
[12:23.54]Cook?
[12:25.04]You cooking?
[12:28.22]Thank you.
[12:28.64]Okay, get this out.
[12:34.65]And then what's the little herb that goes on it?
[12:37.99]Parsley?
[12:38.35]I don't remember.
[12:40.50]It's, uh, parsley.
[12:41.66]Eight?
[12:43.20]Six.
[12:51.06]Presentation is lacking, but it's okay.
[12:52.74]That was pretty good.
[13:00.36]I didn't put horseradish on it.
[13:01.40]Oh, well.
[13:01.72]What?
[13:08.31]I still have to make what?
[13:10.66]Pork chop.
[13:11.06]Oh, tomato soup.
[13:11.56]I got that.
[13:11.98]Ready to go.
[13:15.56]I have a lot of tomato soups, actually.
[13:19.41]Don't have to do anything.
[13:28.85]That looks fucking gross.
[13:30.35]It's not gross.
[13:31.99]It's called preparation.
[13:33.19]Alright, tuna cake.
[13:37.76]Uh, this is almost done.
[13:42.13]Open.
[13:42.35]Okay, this is salt and pepper and that's it, right?
[13:49.70]Let's get this out of plate.
[13:51.72]Plate and then I don't have any potatoes.
[13:54.82]Uh, yeah, I do.
[14:08.47]Same fucking thing.
[14:11.04]Sorry, we ran out of potato chips.
[14:12.28]We have baked potatoes.
[14:21.53]Didn't lose any fame.
[14:22.33]That's fine.
[14:22.75]Alright, let's get this tuna right.
[14:29.75]Salt and pepper, five grams.
[14:31.22]You got it.
[14:32.70]Duck, I got that ready to go.
[14:33.58]Where's that?
[14:37.28]There it is.
[14:40.01]One, two, three, four, five.
[14:42.35]Stick it.
[14:43.33]No, get rid of it.
[14:45.07]Salt.
[14:48.28]I wouldn't eat here.
[14:49.20]Yes, you would.
[14:52.84]Oh, shit.
[14:53.58]A little too much.
[14:54.12]It's okay.
[14:55.18]Throw it on the grill for how long?
[14:56.90]80 seconds a side.
[14:57.70]Throw it on the grill.
[15:06.11]Now we need a lemon cut into slices.
[15:10.53]Four slices of lemon.
[15:18.03]I got that.
[15:29.91]Okay.
[15:30.71]One, two, three... Whatever.
[15:36.97]I can clean them up.
[15:37.47]Look, I can clean them up.
[15:38.40]Watch this.
[15:38.96]Ready?
[15:39.22]How much time?
[15:39.64]How much time?
[15:42.26]Any more food that came in?
[15:43.54]Or is it just this?
[15:44.44]No, duck.
[15:47.62]I need to make more duck broth.
[15:53.66]There's the guy with the horn.
[16:04.24]Plus one.
[16:08.52]I need... That's all done.
[16:10.06]Just oregano twig on top.
[16:12.45]Oh, shit.
[16:12.91]Salmon.
[16:14.65]This is, uh, salt and pepper.
[16:16.59]Good thing I have one ready to go here.
[16:21.97]Is it four or five?
[16:23.29]Five.
[16:27.86]Start a fire.
[16:30.20]Waste the salt.
[16:32.30]Running a kitchen is way too hard.
[16:37.64]Why, why?
[16:38.42]I thought it was salt.
[16:41.95]What?
[16:43.21]What's going on?
[16:44.23]Why am I, what fucking weird mystery world is this?
[16:47.11]I don't understand.
[16:49.07]Why was it, it was already salt and pepper on it.
[16:54.78]I don't, when did I do that?
[16:57.34]Oh.
[17:05.52]Did I do- I must have done that like five days ago.
[17:07.44]Well this is... Nah, they'll be fine.
[17:11.49]They don't- I gotta clean this though.
[17:12.67]Alright, ten oil.
[17:29.12]That's good enough.
[17:30.40]Alright, get it in there.
[17:32.90]One hour aside.
[17:35.19]Alright, and then the potatoes.
[17:36.53]I still have the potatoes cooked.
[17:39.07]How's this doing?
[17:47.22]Is this a deep bowl?
[17:48.28]No, I don't want that.
[17:50.96]I gotta turn this halfway, right?
[17:52.06]I need a plate.
[18:07.44]Okay, then we have the lemon.
[18:09.06]Four lemon slices.
[18:10.30]One.
[18:13.16]Two.
[18:14.18]Three.
[18:14.98]Four.
[18:17.06]Did four get on there?
[18:17.86]No.
[18:19.69]Okay.
[18:20.11]Four and oregano.
[18:25.23]Where the hell is it?
[18:25.83]Right down here.
[18:30.68]Heat up.
[18:37.31]Almost five stars.
[18:42.18]Sam needs to be flipped right now.
[18:48.30]Just do it right.
[18:49.72]It's literally right next to me.
[18:54.08]I just like slingshot it.
[19:01.58]I was just like...
[19:05.42]Alright, any more?
[19:06.97]I got the potatoes already, get a plate.
[19:14.07]Two baked potatoes.
[19:18.93]And any... nothing else, right?
[19:20.27]No?
[19:20.69]Just wait for this to be done, grab it up, and then go.
[19:35.29]Cook the piano.
[19:38.41]What piano?
[19:45.18]Chop the potatoes.
[19:46.62]No, you don't.
[19:47.12]Look.
[19:48.82]Look at the picture.
[19:50.82]It's two big potatoes.
[19:52.07]That's it.
[19:53.89]Potato.
[19:54.53]That's it.
[20:04.64]My inventory is low on soup.
[20:05.82]I gotta get ready for that.
[20:12.09]What am I missing?
[20:12.61]Duck broth?
[20:14.55]Okay, I got 11 minutes.
[20:16.11]I gotta make... I got plenty of tomato.
[20:19.11]How much gazpacho do I have?
[20:22.04]Alright, running low on gazpacho.
[20:23.34]I gotta make duck broth, duck breast, and gazpacho.
[20:29.00]Let's get that going.
[20:31.12]Duck broth.
[20:33.79]So I need water.
[20:37.15]1.3 liters.
[20:39.23]Wait, what do you mean I can't pronounce?
[20:46.53]Can't pronounce what?
[20:50.67]No, not yet.
[20:51.07]I need other shit in here.
[20:54.12]I need a carrot.
[20:56.06]What's in it?
[20:56.40]A carrot and an onion?
[20:57.26]And then the duck breasts?
[21:01.68]That's it, right?
[21:03.72]Carrot, onion, and then two duck breasts.
[21:09.62]And then salt the hell out of it.
[21:16.72]What if I just put like five duck breasts in here?
[21:19.33]And then have them forever.
[21:20.65]I'll never have to cook these ever again.
[21:30.91]I'll get like five.
[21:35.44]okay now move it around a little just so I can did I just pull the water out
[21:56.74]Okay.
[22:00.08]50 milliliters of duck breast.
[22:02.87]Okay, this is good, right?
[22:03.79]I gotta salt the water too.
[22:05.11]Don't forget that.
[22:05.69]How much time do I got?
[22:06.31]Plenty.
[22:08.73]Add a loaf of bread.
[22:10.21]Is it 10?
[22:19.28]That's enough salt.
[22:21.18]Let's go.
[22:24.33]These are all cooking.
[22:25.31]Good, good, good.
[22:25.91]Alright, now we gotta do gazpacho.
[22:28.05]Do I remember the gazpacho?
[22:30.93]I can't even say that fucking word.
[22:33.07]Let's see if I remember it.
[22:37.90]It was two cucumbers, three tomatoes, a loaf of bread, um, I forget the rest.
[22:52.48]Is it two bell peppers or three bell peppers?
[23:00.66]I think it's three.
[23:02.30]And that's it, right?
[23:03.06]Or is there an onion?
[23:08.01]And then one onion.
[23:10.77]Oh, no, that's garlic, garlic.
[23:12.57]That's it.
[23:14.01]And then I go over here, grind it up.
[23:20.62]Okay, then I add this shit.
[23:23.76]I think it's 30 of this, right?
[23:28.08]And then where's the other one?
[23:31.34]It's like some kind of oil.
[23:42.23]Give me a break.
[23:42.85]Okay, three... This is fucking dumb.
[23:51.34]The whole thing wouldn't spill.
[24:01.23]It's salt, pepper, and then there's an oil?
[24:04.25]Where's my oil?
[24:09.85]Right here.
[24:16.06]Okay, and then it's 10 salt, 10 pepper.
[24:18.04]Grind it up again.
[24:18.64]That's dill.
[24:23.88]Oh shit.
[24:24.80]Oh my god.
[24:25.52]Okay, it's done.
[24:27.38]Yeah!
[24:29.10]Right?
[24:29.50]Laugh.
[24:30.54]Everybody laugh.
[24:46.15]Please laugh.
[24:47.51]Please clap.
[24:48.29]Alright, it's done.
[24:54.26]That's good.
[24:54.82]It's just sitting there a little overcooked on the onions, but some people like crispy onions.
[25:06.05]That looks good.
[25:07.11]Don't need more than 220, 250.
[25:08.71]That's good.
[25:12.85]Put this down for a minute.
[25:18.94]I can probably do two more?
[25:20.14]Three more?
[25:20.62]Let's find out.
[25:30.91]This might be it.
[25:32.31]Can I get one more in here?
[25:34.29]Okay, that's good.
[25:35.63]That should be enough.
[25:40.53]Almost... Almost landed perfectly.
[25:44.21]These are all capped up.
[25:45.01]Alright, now I need to get the duck broth.
[25:48.67]How much time?
[25:49.65]Fine, I got plenty of time.
[25:50.50]This is fine.
[25:52.06]Alright, I want to put the broth over here where it was before.
[25:56.90]That's tomato.
[25:57.42]Tomato.
[26:01.25]Let's get this over here.
[26:01.97]Alright, I need like three or four more plates.
[26:07.96]Plates do not break anymore, right?
[26:09.38]Yeah, I got that upgrade.
[26:13.46]Just get him over there.
[26:17.42]I gotta be careful though, because I will knock over all the tomato soups.
[26:25.09]I have one more.
[26:25.61]Okay, let's set him up.
[26:34.02]Oof, that frame rate.
[26:45.80]I think I'm just gonna cook like five tuna steaks too if I have time.
[26:48.27]Alright, let's get all these out so I can cut them.
[26:50.93]Where's my cutting board?
[26:57.59]We're gonna skimp the absolute fuck out of this too.
[27:01.22]I'm going to have duck breast for like a month.
[27:04.51]It's going to be great.
[27:09.09]The onions doesn't need it.
[27:09.95]It's fine.
[27:16.32]Give me the knife.
[27:19.06]Nice and thin.
[27:24.30]Nice and thin.
[27:24.88]Ready?
[27:25.08]Check it.
[27:40.85]So much duck.
[27:43.70]Alright, put the knife down.
[27:48.48]So tender.
[27:49.90]Is this all gonna fit on here?
[27:50.74]No.
[27:58.56]No, it's not.
[27:59.84]Just give me... Hold on.
[28:00.70]Let me get another... I need to get another plate.
[28:02.92]That's not gonna happen.
[28:04.14]I need a big plate.
[28:07.61]There we go.
[28:13.87]That's raw?
[28:14.87]No, this is what duck is supposed to look like.
[28:17.41]You ever had duck before?
[28:20.48]It looks like this.
[28:21.10]Alright, that's a couple more pieces of duck on the table.
[28:30.13]It doesn't?
[28:30.51]Yes, it does.
[28:30.97]Duck is like grain in the middle.
[28:34.57]It's not.
[28:38.51]Okay, got my duck ready.
[28:39.81]My broth is ready to be poured into the bowls.
[28:44.44]Is there an extra duck breast under there?
[28:46.76]Nice, there is.
[28:47.34]Alright, 200.
[28:54.94]230.
[29:00.29]Let's see if I can spread this out around 5.
[29:01.91]250. 220.
[29:15.95]380 is still a little more.
[29:16.77]Which one?
[29:17.26]This one needs a little more.
[29:24.72]Let's transfer some of these into here.
[29:28.37]And then I'm gonna cook up, like, a bunch of meat, too.
[29:34.43]Easy with this.
[29:35.39]Don't fucking drop it.
[29:38.01]Alright, so I got my broth.
[29:39.42]I got one more breast in here.
[29:41.06]Where is it?
[29:46.27]Let's cut it up.
[29:47.53]Oops.
[29:52.97]Let's make this one even thinner.
[29:54.84]I want paper-thin slices of duck.
[29:59.82]Still got a minute left.
[30:06.54]Jeremy, no.
[30:07.60]Wait, why not?
[30:19.51]You trick your brain into thinking there's more food.
[30:27.51]This is a really good technique.
[30:29.25]I'm telling you.
[30:31.27]Did that not even cut?
[30:36.76]What?
[30:39.34]No, it did.
[30:39.80]Okay.
[30:45.79]That looks pretty good.
[30:47.49]I would eat this.
[30:55.94]See, you got two different kinds of duck.
[30:57.04]You got like breast meat and like thigh meat.
[31:01.26]Alright, almost time to go.
[31:02.47]Uh, what do I need to do before this continues?
[31:05.65]Um, okay.

[31:13.25]130 bucks.
[31:15.23]I have a bunch of time in the beginning of this day too.
[31:18.75]Uncooked versus cooked.
[31:19.81]Some people want raw meat.
[31:22.75]I want more time in the beginning of the day.
[31:30.14]Maybe fame points.
[31:35.10]Let's see.

[49:45.33]But this is not right.
[49:47.82]This is not seasoned correctly.
[49:49.18]I have so much of it, too.

[50:21.76]Tomato soup, I got that over here.
[50:35.18]Alright, that's good.
[50:38.24]Oh, it's because I put way too much duck in the broth.

[55:14.49]Get this one perfect.
[55:17.19]And then it's... Parsley.
[55:20.08]Six.
[55:20.34]Six.
[55:24.70]This one will be good.
[55:27.43]This should be at least five stars.
[55:29.49]Four or five stars.
[55:31.03]That's perfect.
[55:33.81]Yeah.
[55:36.03]There we go.
[55:37.15]I'm bringing it back.
[55:42.91]Is something still cooking?
[55:48.57]The oven is just on.
[55:50.57]There you go.
[56:02.15]Not bad.
[56:07.98]Duck broth again.
[56:08.74]We're going for not losing points on the duck broth.
[56:11.14]I'm going to season it.
[56:13.74]Salt and pepper, right?
[56:14.54]Let me get this out quickly.
[56:33.67]Perfect.
[56:36.79]So, what was wrong with the duck?
[56:40.37]Do I need more salt?
[56:44.36]Is it salt or pepper?
[56:57.42]And where's the salt?
[57:01.05]That looks like a mess.
[57:02.21]Salt!
[57:02.81]Salt!
[57:05.87]I need, like, a salt in every corner of the room.
[57:11.90]Okay.
[57:13.44]I seasoned it up.
[57:14.66]Let's put some duck on here.
[57:19.43]And hopefully we can at least get three stars.
[57:20.93]No.
[57:26.35]Net zero.
[57:28.15]Thank god.
[57:29.77]Still under-seasoned?
[57:32.08]too much pepper and too much salt so I I needed to dilute it with water I'm here it was too much I need another trout okay here we go duck too much salt and too much pepper
[58:26.42]See if diluting helps.
[58:33.73]Yep.
[58:33.89]Yeah, it does.
[58:37.13]Now there's not enough pepper.
[58:42.03]Baked trout.
[58:42.55]I can do the trout.
[58:43.15]I'm going to make this one perfect again.
[58:46.19]Because I'll get more fame points.
[58:48.69]And what do you know?
[58:49.25]I got this right now.
[58:50.00]Ready to move.

[60:23.22]I have a pork chop just sitting out.
[60:24.34]Yes, I do.
[60:26.70]Uh...
[60:45.41]What?
[60:45.73]No.
[60:45.99]Cancel.
[60:46.27]What are you doing?
[60:51.67]Turn off the fucking water, please.
[60:55.58]Have I lost my mind?
[60:56.56]There's nothing in here.
[61:21.87]Almost got a perfect.
[61:24.43]I need... What's the seasoning?
[61:28.67]Salt, pepper, thyme.
[61:36.72]Oh my fucking god.
[61:38.08]Why does this have so much on it already?
[61:44.05]When did I season this?
[62:01.46]Okay, lemon, plate and lemon.
[62:14.30]Oh, it's a little, it's off, it's off, it's okay though, it's fine.
[62:26.75]It's just barely hanging on the edge.
[62:28.09]Actually, presentation-wise, it looks pretty good.
[62:30.71]Parsley, right?
[62:32.35]Yeah.
[62:48.40]Why?
[62:48.62]Where'd the fish go?
[62:53.38]Where's the fish?
[62:54.06]Where did it go?
[62:55.18]It fell into the ground.
[62:58.31]I don't see it anywhere.
[62:59.13]Okay.
[62:59.54]Well, that's fantastic.
[63:00.78]Great.
[63:01.06]I'm glad.
[63:27.89]What just came in come on hurry up go go go go go go go go Come on 30 seconds 20 seconds, it's almost done
[64:08.63]I had to get it out.
[64:09.15]It was still fine.
[64:10.83]Not gonna lose points.
[64:11.39]Alright, we got the pork chop.
[64:16.27]That's it.
[64:16.69]We just need the potatoes.
[64:18.24]We just need the cooked chip potatoes.
[64:20.38]I don't have any of those.
[64:24.32]We'll just use these.
[64:24.84]Plate.
[64:27.66]Plate.
[64:39.71]That's way too many.
[64:40.69]I'm gonna take some off.
[64:57.36]Done.
[65:07.67]It was the potatoes.
[65:08.83]Sorry, I'm not gonna lose any points.
[65:11.83]That's it, right?
[65:12.47]Any more?
[65:18.10]I'll clean up.
[65:21.70]I'll make this one perfect.
[65:23.64]I have to.
[65:26.12]And I mean, like, the best I could possibly do.
[65:28.14]I don't have another one of those made.
[65:29.52]Alright, hold on.
[65:31.15]Salt, pepper.
[65:33.03]Let's get them both out here.
[65:35.05]These two are gonna be good.
[65:38.48]They're both just salt and pepper.
[65:40.86]This one... I already got the boiled potatoes.
[65:43.30]This one is not clean, but it's okay.
[65:46.87]Speaking of clean... Is this clean?
[65:51.19]No.
[66:01.65]Ten in here.
[66:06.95]A little too much oil, but it's fine.
[66:08.12]Alright, so now I'm gonna get these going.
[66:10.24]Salt and pepper on both.
[66:19.36]Is it five on both, or is it four on both?
[66:22.24]Five on this one, five on both.
[66:30.13]Come on, I did it five times.
[66:31.69]Why do you do that?
[66:32.49]I clearly just clicked on it.
[66:33.41]Salt.
[66:35.21]Salt.
[66:39.40]This goes on the grill, this goes on the pan.
[66:52.70]Alright, let's go.
[66:55.00]Bang.
[66:58.80]Get it on.
[67:02.02]Alright, now I need to do... I got the potatoes, this one's already done.
[67:06.04]And then I need to lemon into slices.
[67:11.96]Four slices.
[67:24.89]Done.
[67:25.91]Flip it.
[67:28.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was my specialty.
[67:29.59]How's this going?
[67:40.18]Pretty good.
[67:49.65]Make lemon fries.
[67:54.55]That would actually probably be kind of good.
[68:00.85]Almost done.
[68:01.17]Flip.
[68:11.79]And flip it.
[68:13.23]Now.
[68:17.82]Same deal over here.
[68:24.36]Not quite.
[68:25.30]I have to flip it again, though.
[68:32.16]Take a look at that char.
[68:33.10]I know, it's a beautiful char.
[68:35.98]And there's beautiful bird shit all over this grill.
[68:38.60]I'm gonna flip it.
[68:50.23]Okay, good.
[68:51.83]Let it cook the rest.
[68:53.45]This one's almost going to take off.
[68:54.51]Put it on a plate, almost.
[68:55.61]Let's get this down.
[68:56.23]And I needed, what do you need with this?
[69:00.02]Just two potatoes for that one, and then this one needs the lemon slices and oregano.
[69:07.17]You got it.
[69:20.93]Almost, almost, go go go go Bethesda is starting?
[69:38.26]No, it's not starting!
[69:41.14]I keep looking over here and I see Bethesda, hurry!
[69:43.68]Starting in five minutes!
[69:47.08]Done?
[69:48.46]Okay, this is just lemon slices
[69:59.32]Lemon slices and then oregano.
[70:06.89]How many?
[70:07.77]Eight.
[70:18.68]That should be the end of the day.
[70:21.84]That's perfect.
[70:23.12]That's a lot of points.
[70:23.88]Good.
[70:24.52]How does a full five star not have more points?
[70:28.95]Alright, I think we're probably gonna get a new recipe here.
[70:33.56]Is this salmon steak hanging out over here?
[70:35.42]Whatever, throw it away.
[70:38.28]Alright.
[70:39.90]I need to do some cleaning.
[70:44.44]Just put everything in the sink.
[70:52.49]Is this clean?
[70:53.27]This is not clean.
[71:02.69]Let's get that set.
[71:04.13]Turn off the stove.
[71:05.49]This is clean.
[71:07.07]This is fine.
[71:11.51]There's a salmon just still in there.
[71:13.21]Alright, let's get the repairman.
[71:16.89]All these potatoes, are they cooked?
[71:19.49]No.
[71:19.81]Put them back.
[71:20.17]Can I put them back?
[71:25.54]So much junk.
[71:26.10]I gotta get the bucket.
[71:41.54]Clean up the floor.
[71:42.30]Alright, that's in.
[71:49.67]It's out.
[71:51.37]It's in.
[71:53.31]Carrot on the ground.
[71:58.37]Send this for food?
[71:59.29]That's not gonna work.
[72:00.15]There's nothing to send.
[72:01.11]Okay, I can clean that up.
[72:07.51]Put it back up there.
[72:08.39]Nothing in the ground up here.
[72:09.75]There's a couple of these things.
[72:18.13]And that should be good.
[72:19.07]A little bit over here.
[72:20.03]Alright.
[72:26.96]Dump it.
[72:31.70]Set this back up.
[72:34.84]Oh, I would throw these away, but I don't want to.
[72:37.97]Yeah, I will.
[72:39.07]It's a fucking mess over here.
[72:40.21]It's an absolute mess.
[72:55.44]What is happening with this?
[72:56.94]Why does it keep doing this?
[73:02.12]How much time?
[73:02.90]Plenty.
[73:06.38]I'm going to stick this down, and... That fucking person beeping the horn is going to drive me insane.
[73:14.71]Let's wash the counter.
[73:16.45]Put the horseradish over here.
[73:26.25]See, I'm cleaning.
[73:26.85]You guys think I'm not gonna clean... I'm gonna have to get a repairman in here.
[73:33.05]This is all messed up.
[73:34.43]This looks like crap.
[73:46.18]I can't believe Todd Howard just announced RAP MOVIE 3!
[73:48.86]That would be interesting.
[73:57.52]That would be really strange.
[73:58.52]Alright, let me put this away.
[74:01.92]In the mop.
[74:07.01]Watch out for the floor.
[74:08.01]No more spills, right?
[74:16.43]Nope.
[74:24.14]Okay, now I need repair.
[74:27.50]Gotta fix all this bullshit in here.
[74:28.83]Need a new fridge?
[74:36.23]Yeah.
[74:41.87]Fix that.
[74:42.60]Just fix everything.
[74:46.16]Fix this.
[74:47.98]Fix this.
[74:49.30]Fix the fryer later.
[74:51.22]Fix the stove.
[74:54.38]Anything else need to be repaired?
[74:55.24]I don't think so.
[74:55.92]What about the counter?
[74:56.70]I can't fix the counter?
[74:57.74]Yeah, I can.
[74:58.54]Fix the counter.
[75:03.56]Money well spent.
[75:10.72]How much time do I have?
[75:12.86]Alright.
[75:13.69]So, I have to... I need to make some shit.
[75:18.63]I gotta make some stuff.
[75:21.65]Let's move this Cayenne pepper back over here.
[75:25.53]I need a little spice rack.
[75:35.63]How am I doing on soups?
[75:37.21]I need to make another gazpacho?
[75:39.49]No, this looks like enough.
[75:44.32]Three, three.
[75:45.26]I need to make, yeah, I got plenty of tomato.
[75:48.18]I gotta make some duck.
[75:50.66]This is all junk, I think.
[75:58.14]It's just not made right.
[75:59.18]This is junk.
[76:07.17]Unfortunately, I had to do that.
[76:16.89]When is the Bethesda conference?
[76:18.03]It is in... I think, like, 30 minutes?
[76:23.06]40 minutes?
[76:25.10]Let me check.
[76:27.66]What just happened?
[76:29.52]What's going on?
[76:31.20]What the hell just happened?
[76:41.26]Well, that's great.
[76:45.37]It's been 90 minutes.
[76:46.25]Yes, we've got plenty of time.
[76:47.55]That just broke this raspberry juice.
[76:53.73]I need to just get rid of this because every time I put this down, it just causes a problem.
[77:01.42]I have to carry this around with me.
[77:22.74]Okay, good.
[77:26.52]Well, now I have more shit to clean up.
[77:27.68]That's great.
[77:28.16]I'm going to make a gazpacho.
[77:29.39]No.
[77:30.61]Duck.
[77:34.78]Let's try this again.
[77:36.98]1.3, and then what?
[77:38.72]12 salt, 12 pepper, and 2 ducks.
[77:43.22]That's what the recipe was last time.
[77:49.52]So I'll season this up.
[77:50.46]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[77:52.91]It's 12 and 12.
[78:03.29]I think.
[78:03.65]Or maybe ten, but it's okay if it's a little bit over.
[78:09.34]Again, I'm missing the salt.
[78:11.12]Again.
[78:13.40]Yet again, I have no idea where the salt is.
[78:15.42]I'm just going to buy five of them and put them in every corner.
[78:17.26]I don't care.
[78:29.85]They're two cents.
[78:30.57]I'm going to do the same thing with pepper.
[78:40.49]There'll always be one.
[78:41.83]No matter where I am.
[78:51.18]There we go.
[78:51.84]Okay.
[78:52.68]Let me clean this up.
[78:54.38]My bucket.
[78:56.13]Still standing.
[78:56.87]That was weird.
[78:59.69]The bucket.
[79:11.80]Potato rack.
[79:14.52]No, I need... Put this over here.
[79:21.81]Give me the sponge.
[79:23.79]This is gonna give me, like, anxiety.
[79:25.07]I can't have that.
[79:33.41]I can't have, like, blueberry juice all over the place.
[79:43.20]okay up down I need another bottle of uh uh vinegar right and then I can make the duck and we can get going
[80:05.11]Spatula, bring it back.
[80:07.13]Alright.
[80:08.37]This is looking a little better.
[80:10.37]This is my salt and pepper.
[80:11.31]Always put them right next to each other.
[80:13.19]Clean, clean, clean.
[80:14.83]Why is there a blend in here?
[80:27.38]We good?
[80:28.16]I think that's it.
[80:29.48]Now I'm gonna make the broth for the duck.
[80:31.65]One carrot, one onion.
[80:34.08]I've already salted and peppered this, haven't I?
[80:35.46]I have not.
[80:45.78]Are you sure?
[80:46.14]Oh, god damn it.
[80:50.51]It's alright.
[80:51.63]No, I did.
[80:52.05]I did.
[80:52.39]I did.
[80:52.73]I did.
[80:53.93]Didn't I do this?
[81:01.37]I did.
[81:01.75]Didn't I put pepper in there?
[81:10.03]Do I need pepper in there?
[81:12.61]Does pepper?
[81:13.67]No pepper.
[81:15.39]OK, duck.
[81:18.07]It's two duck breasts.
[81:25.17]And that's it.
[81:25.91]And you start it up.
[81:36.58]Yeah, that'll be fine.
[81:41.03]is watching you play this on stage.
[81:46.13]Oops.
[81:50.74]Can you imagine?
[81:55.64]Didn't level up.
[81:57.76]Alright, is the critic gonna come today so I can finally do this?
[82:03.51]We got to fame three and then it was immediately ripped from us.
[82:07.11]Grilled tuna steak is the dish of the day.
[82:09.89]You got it.
[82:15.59]It needs to simmer overnight.
[82:21.01]Alright.
[82:21.39]Tuna steak.
[82:21.97]Let's get them out.
[82:23.13]Salt them up.
[82:23.63]Okay.
[82:42.30]Salt and pepper in every location.
[82:43.80]Good.
[82:44.54]It's five and five.
[82:52.40]that good good good put it on the ground it hits don't worry it'll hit the ground
[83:21.16]There's plenty of time for this tuna stick to hit the ground.
[83:23.16]At least half of these will.
[83:24.08]Two out of the four will be on the ground.
[83:30.78]Todd Howard just said the new Elder Scrolls map is at least five... At least five times... What are you saying?
[83:36.44]At least five as big as me?
[83:37.86]Five Jermas?
[83:46.68]Shit.
[83:47.55]I just left this sitting like that.
[83:48.85]Alright, hold on.
[83:57.14]Fucking ruined it, I think.
[84:02.19]How cooked is it?
[84:02.79]Is it overcooked?
[84:10.11]It looks alright.
[84:19.84]You're wasting more duck.
[84:21.14]No, I'm not.
[84:21.76]It's fine.
[84:24.24]Let's get four or five plates over there and I can start the day.
[84:26.64]I gotta get my tuna steaks ready.
[84:44.77]Last one.
[84:49.28]Okay.
[84:50.44]I got my broth.
[84:52.44]Just set them up in a row here.
[84:53.76]We'll be good to go.
[85:02.36]We need more detail.
[85:05.53]Alright, let's start pouring it.
[85:07.59]Here we go.
[85:08.05]The onion's a little burnt.
[85:09.81]But I don't think it'll be too much of a problem. 225.
[85:19.79]230.
[85:19.81]As long as it's over 220.
[85:22.49]That's good.
[85:28.46]290.
[85:28.50]That's a little over.
[85:33.06]270.
[85:33.08]I can spread this out a little bit more.
[85:37.24]That's good.
[85:37.56]Alright.
[85:37.96]Good.
[85:39.74]Duck.
[85:41.75]Is cut.
[85:42.67]Give me a plate.
[85:49.92]How much time?
[85:50.60]Five minutes.
[85:51.80]I can prepare the tuna steaks as well.
[86:00.21]Slow and steady.
[86:01.21]Don't explode.
[86:01.97]Alright.
[86:03.19]Tuna steaks.
[86:03.67]These have all been salted.
[86:04.53]Now I have to just grill them up.
[86:06.39]I'm going to put them all on at the same time.
[86:10.37]Now give me a plate.
[86:15.61]Transfer them all.
[86:19.71]What did I tell you?
[86:20.17]There's at least one.
[86:24.19]Well, that one was dropped a double.
[86:27.99]We have one out of four.
[86:28.77]I hit the gun twice.
[86:29.54]Does that count?
[86:40.56]Alright, that's good.
[86:42.59]Now, I need lemons, right?
[86:44.37]Lemons into squares.
[86:46.89]Four slices on each lemon.
[86:48.41]I need four lemons.
[86:54.64]Get them on the cutting board.
[86:59.18]Excellent.
[87:08.47]Four into fours.
[87:12.89]No, I gotta move this shit out of the way.
[87:14.05]I can't do that.
[87:14.63]There we go.
[87:16.95]These have to be good.
[87:18.13]They do.
[87:27.56]I should be able to get these.
[87:30.28]One.
[87:31.46]Two.
[87:32.34]Three.
[87:32.74]Four.
[87:33.10]One.
[87:36.07]What are you doing to me?
[87:41.01]Oh, whatever.
[87:41.45]That one's a little jacked up, but it's fine.
[87:42.81]Alright.
[87:50.77]Lemons are done.
[87:52.68]Steaks.
[87:54.50]Oh!
[87:55.12]Oh!
[87:56.16]Oh!
[87:56.52]Oh!
[87:57.02]Oh!
[87:59.29]Oh!
[88:13.18]Saved.
[88:13.80]Nice.
[88:16.44]Is this cooking?
[88:19.04]Yes.
[88:21.38]Alright.
[88:22.09]I also need... How much... What do I need?
[88:23.47]Parsley?
[88:25.07]I actually forget what it is, but okay.
[88:26.33]Now that we're almost done with that, I'm gonna get...
[88:30.72]My broth is already done.
[88:31.66]My tomato soup.
[88:32.36]I have gazpacho.
[88:33.18]I have borscht.
[88:35.84]I think I'm going to get a couple of these out too.
[88:39.12]There's always a herring.
[88:41.61]Always.
[88:42.69]Season these up.
[88:45.05]I don't remember what it is.
[88:46.79]It's... Give me a big plate.
[89:04.64]Pepper, Thyme, and Dill.
[89:05.82]Okay.
[89:07.88]P.T.D.
[89:09.10]Pepper, Thyme, Dill.
[89:12.20]Wow, these are going to be perfect.
[89:16.61]Todd is beating up somebody in the audience.
[89:18.83]Oh, okay.
[89:20.69]Sure he is.
[89:25.86]That one's not done.
[89:32.86]Well, the edge of that needs to be cooked a little more.
[89:35.07]Okay, let's put this down.
[89:41.39]Alright, now in the meantime, pepper thyme dill.
[89:43.47]Pepper.
[89:57.73]Pepper.
[90:02.86]Thyme dill.
[90:03.70]Okay.
[90:18.31]Pepper.
[90:18.97]Thyme.
[90:19.85]Thyme.
[90:20.91]It's done?
[90:21.71]Done.
[90:23.81]Steaks are ready.
[90:26.55]Now I just need... Thyme.
[90:31.18]I'll trade you.
[90:33.88]Get these in the oven.
[90:34.70]Two at a time.
[90:44.29]I'm putting a stamp on them.
[90:49.67]I can do two at a time, right?
[90:53.39]We're open.
[90:57.51]Okay.
[90:59.15]Let's go.
[91:00.05]Oh, I'm ready.
[91:01.15]Right off the bat.
[91:02.74]Right off the bat.
[91:03.28]Perfect.
[91:04.66]I just need to cut a lemon into quarters?
[91:08.98]Gimme one.
[91:17.93]You guys are obsessed with Todd.
[91:22.76]You just are.
[91:29.24]Do you think Todd ever just reads a Twitch chat?
[91:34.20]And just sits there and goes... This is really strange.
[91:39.47]Do you think he knows what everybody says?
[91:41.75]Maybe he just doesn't do social media.
[91:48.11]He doesn't look at all.
[91:55.24]When these come out horseradish.
[92:00.25]I need two of these.
[92:02.61]Get it done.
[92:12.27]I can't even imagine what it would be like to be like Todd Howard.
[92:16.42]Sometimes I open up my Twitter and like somebody will like draw a picture of me with like spit coming out of my nose and like shit all over me.
[92:28.63]I mean, can you imagine being Todd Howard?
[92:44.35]People, like, draw me, like, five feet tall, like a clown, and, like, puking and stuff.
[92:49.73]I can't even imagine.
[92:50.53]Alright, this is all cut.
[92:59.09]Alright, now I just need a plate.
[93:05.69]Season it up.
[93:09.57]I need horseradish on this and then we can get out of here.
[93:19.25]God damn it, did I actually get it on the lemon?
[93:21.83]I fucked it up, it's alright.
[93:24.85]And then this is just parsley.
[93:27.15]How many?
[93:28.81]Alright, this one's off.
[93:43.00]I'm going to season this one up too.
[93:45.30]What was so wrong with that?
[93:46.90]What was wrong with that?
[93:47.60]It was perfect.
[93:50.62]There was a problem with the lemon quarters.
[93:52.63]What was wrong with it?
[93:53.77]It was fine.
[93:56.67]What was wrong with that?
[93:57.47]Seriously.
[93:59.89]You didn't like how it was cut?
[94:00.81]What the hell are you talking about?
[94:03.27]Alright, give me a plate.
[94:11.84]I'm just gonna get this ready to go and move it.
[94:13.14]That's salmon?
[94:19.43]I don't have any salmon made.
[94:25.27]And where's the parsley?
[94:31.22]I'm just going to move this over here because it's done.
[94:34.08]Now I need the salmon, which is... I have two potatoes already done here.
[94:38.33]I've got salmon filet.
[94:39.53]Just cook it up.
[94:41.93]Easy.
[94:56.97]Go back to Cod.
[94:57.93]What the hell are you talking about?
[95:00.07]Go back to Cod?
[95:00.87]I didn't play Cod.
[95:04.63]That's way too much oil, but it's alright.
[95:06.15]It's still edible.
[95:13.44]Give me some more orders.
[95:14.22]I got them all ready.
[95:14.84]Come on.
[95:25.70]Two potatoes.
[95:27.67]These are cooked.
[95:28.53]No, I don't want that one.
[95:29.47]Put that one back.
[95:30.21]That one's dirty.
[95:32.55]That one's, like, burnt.
[95:33.72]Can I try?
[95:34.06]I want to try this one.
[95:34.74]Here we go.
[95:35.22]One that's not burnt.
[95:37.34]This one's good.
[95:40.36]If I don't want to use the horrible ones, I'm not going to.
[95:47.72]Spatula, where are you?
[95:55.27]Todd's crying.
[96:04.28]What are you guys doing?
[96:05.60]What is wrong with you guys?
[96:19.23]You guys are so excited for this conference.
[96:21.17]You guys are just so raring to go.
[96:28.56]I'm sorry to say, they're gonna announce like a new hat in The Elder Scrolls Online.
[96:34.69]And they're reducing the price of the... They're reducing the price of, like, all in-game purchases in Blades by, like, 8%.
[96:43.85]That's what you're getting.
[96:49.30]And then Todd's gonna sneeze into a napkin and turn it around, and it's gonna be, like... It's gonna say, like, The Elder Scrolls VI on it.
[96:55.72]It's gonna be, like, blood.
[96:56.64]He's, like, got blood in his... I don't know why he has blood in his nose.
[97:16.82]Serve it up.
[97:23.73]Is it weird?
[97:24.17]I kind of hope that he does.
[97:28.57]No, never mind.
[97:29.33]I was going to just say something a little stupid.
[97:35.33]He comes out and does like the Pendova Jim Carrey thing.
[97:39.19]Where he like talks with his butt.
[97:45.76]Alright, is the duck worth it?
[97:51.60]I think this is good.
[97:53.15]We remade the duck.
[98:00.45]Nice.
[98:00.71]Okay, good.
[98:04.45]We're so close to getting that extra star.
[98:08.89]French fries and steak.
[98:10.33]I don't have that ready to go, so we're going to have to make it.
[98:19.34]Turn the grill on.
[98:20.18]Salt and pepper.
[98:20.78]Get it on there quick.
[98:34.08]Good.
[98:34.28]Alright.
[98:38.34]I still have the potatoes, but they're junk.
[98:42.30]These are so junky.
[98:43.58]Hold on.
[98:43.88]Let me see if I can cut these into fries and then salt them.
[98:46.08]Give me a plate.
[98:52.44]If I can at least make these look nice, then it should be fine.
[98:56.75]Let's go with this.
[99:00.07]How many should I get?
[99:00.69]Like four or five of them?
[99:01.95]Cut them into little fries?
[99:06.96]And then salt them up.
[99:07.98]This should be good.
[99:21.23]Okay, give me the... Wait, turn this.
[99:22.45]Give me the knife.
[99:31.84]I cut these into fries.
[99:41.45]Is that not doing anything?
[99:49.55]Why?
[99:56.87]Alright, why did that work and the other one didn't?
[100:03.00]Oh, who cares?
[100:13.83]Why can't I cut these?
[100:27.44]They're not salted.
[100:29.78]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[100:37.94]Enjoy.
[100:44.98]Good enough.
[100:56.41]You guys have lost your minds.
[101:11.36]Todd did this.
[101:12.16]Todd said that.
[101:13.03]Todd did this.
[101:13.85]Todd went here.
[101:26.54]Todd has the flu.
[101:31.40]Got this ready to go.
[101:32.04]This should be perfect.
[101:33.90]And I need oregano.
[101:37.18]So it's four slices and then oregano.
[101:41.36]I'm so ready for this shit.
[101:42.30]I need one, two, three, four, and then oregano.
[101:53.01]And I got the duck ready to go right there too.
[101:55.71]I might get to level 3 here.
[101:56.53]This is going to be level 3.
[102:05.12]Todd just Todded all the Todds.
[102:06.62]We're now Todd.
[102:07.56]Todd achieved.
[102:09.86]You're getting smurf here.
[102:15.13]Wait, how many of these do I have to do?
[102:18.71]Two?
[102:19.99]Two ducks?
[102:29.24]Let's do three.
[102:30.93]Grab me another one.
[102:35.83]Alright, back to back.
[102:36.41]Let's see if there's enough.
[102:47.23]Two ducks.
[102:49.66]Everyone's so excited.
[102:51.16]Everyone can't wait for this.
[102:52.36]I can't wait either.
[102:53.14]I can't wait to see.
[102:53.80]I wonder what they're going to do.
[102:58.10]Oh, fuck you, game.
[102:59.48]That's such bullshit.
[103:00.32]That's gonna bring me down.
[103:14.05]Hahaha!
[103:23.94]Oh my god!
[103:25.90]Can we just get this off the fucking table?
[103:30.57]What the fuck?
[103:31.37]I've wasted two perfectly good soups.
[103:35.91]Give me a break.
[103:40.51]Why?
[103:43.55]Those are perfectly fine.
[103:49.62]What's the last thing?
[103:50.48]One more duck.
[103:57.07]I have another gazpacho, don't I?
[103:58.27]Yeah, I do.
[104:01.59]Finally, some soups.
[104:11.45]150!
[104:12.11]Yes!
[104:12.73]Finally!
[104:13.19]Level 3!
[104:15.89]What's the last thing I got?
[104:17.72]Gazpacho.
[104:18.24]I already got it.
[104:18.82]Right here.
[104:19.12]Ready to go.
[104:19.56]I'm low on soups.
[104:25.64]Another steak dinner?
[104:29.33]No tuna.
[104:37.44]It's a gazpacho.
[104:40.72]I like saying gazpacho.
[104:46.70]Finally, a tuna.
[104:54.66]I just hear gas.
[104:57.30]That's not a good sign.
[105:01.09]One, two, three, four, and then it is Rigno.
[105:09.57]Give me a perfect score on this one, please.
[105:12.13]I'll take it.
[105:20.83]I love how rowdy everybody is right now over this E3 Todd conference.
[105:29.52]I would've had it too, that's such a- that sucks.
[105:31.60]This sucks.
[105:32.70]I have to make that from scratch now.
[105:35.29]Uh, let me just do the steak.
[105:36.61]Quickly.
[105:43.42]Salt, pepper, get on the grill.
[105:52.84]I think people are more excited for Todd Howard to just walk on the stage than they are about the games he may or may not be announcing.
[106:04.03]Okay, I need the french fries.
[106:09.13]Let's just dump these for a second.
[106:15.90]I need potatoes on this.
[106:24.78]Why are they all falling off the plate?
[106:28.83]Flip.
[106:29.31]Salt.
[106:39.05]I actually kind of want to eat those.
[106:41.58]One, two, three, go.
[106:48.37]Okay, everything's good.
[106:49.73]This is what it is.
[106:50.31]This just burns on.
[106:52.32]Alright, now I need to make a... I need to make the borscht.
[106:56.24]Onion, carrot, parsley, beetroot.
[106:58.50]I forget what it's like.
[107:00.42]How many is it?
[107:01.40]I haven't made it in so long.
[107:04.60]It's chicken broth.
[107:06.34]A thousand?
[107:07.20]Seven hundred.
[107:15.73]How's this looking?
[107:16.91]Almost done.
[107:18.94]And then it's salt, right?
[107:20.84]Let me look at the recipe.
[107:23.57]20 grams, 20 grams.
[107:24.59]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[107:25.07]It's like ridiculously seasoned.
[107:44.35]Green fell.
[107:46.11]Yeah.
[107:48.03]Are you guys really trying to tell me that the Titan Tron fell down?
[107:51.98]Thank God I have one more of those, but I'm going to make this first.
[107:54.08]Looks good.
[108:09.87]20 grams.
[108:10.27]This is so salt intensive.
[108:12.11]People actually eat this?
[108:15.96]This is like a thousand milligrams of salt per serving.
[108:18.61]It's like drinking salt.
[108:21.55]No, now I need... I swear to God.
[108:25.41]Get the fuck away from me.
[108:29.91]Just get them away.
[108:35.48]Like magnetic.
[108:36.50]God damn it.
[108:37.84]Am I cooking anything?
[108:40.88]No, nothing's cooking, right?
[108:42.00]Alright.
[108:44.36]I need to buy another bottle of this shit.
[108:45.96]What a pain in the ass.
[109:04.73]Salt.
[109:05.09]Pepper.
[109:05.59]Again.
[109:05.91]Do it again.
[109:16.43]Where's the salt?
[109:17.19]I just had it.
[109:30.01]God.
[109:31.35]Alright, this is parsley, carrot, um, five beets, and an onion.
[109:41.98]If I remember- I think that's it.
[109:45.14]Cook it.
[109:45.76]Go.
[109:49.13]What else do I need to get?
[109:49.75]I can spot you.
[109:51.61]I can already hear you.
[109:52.11]It's right there.
[110:00.93]You guys are fucking crazy.
[110:02.52]You just ordered... Come on, hurry up.
[110:20.77]I got that!
[110:24.23]Here, I got an idea.
[110:26.11]It's already ready.
[110:26.73]New order of what?
[110:27.45]Tomato soup?
[110:44.84]I'm so excited!
[110:46.46]Too many lemons?
[110:47.84]No, that's the right amount of lemons.
[110:49.56]See?
[110:53.07]Making some good money.
[110:53.71]Alright, how are we looking?
[110:56.61]Onion, take it out.
[111:00.09]And this is tomato, right?
[111:00.85]Yep.
[111:09.18]Because we need a little Christmas right this very minute.
[111:16.58]Is that the song that's playing?
[111:18.60]Because we need a little Christmas right this very minute.
[111:24.30]Uh, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[111:30.35]Perfect timing.
[111:34.71]I actually have to take that out now.
[111:41.47]Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry!
[111:46.16]Good!
[112:00.05]Saved it.
[112:04.35]Apparently, it was perfect.
[112:05.27]Alright, duck.
[112:10.86]Careful with this.
[112:13.44]Duck broth, right here.
[112:14.36]That's the last one.
[112:15.14]Hopefully nobody else orders it.
[112:24.91]And hopefully that goes through.
[112:25.99]God.
[112:35.83]And... I got the last tuna.
[112:38.14]Hopefully... Wait, where's the last tuna?
[112:41.28]Oh, come on.
[112:41.78]It's another duck.
[112:48.32]I still have just a full herring that nobody ordered.
[112:53.16]Get...
[113:01.15]I'm gonna pee my pants.
[113:02.13]I'm gonna piss really bad.
[113:03.45]I'm gonna make sure I pee before the conference.
[113:06.76]What are we, team mod is what?
[113:15.86]Duck.
[113:18.36]I guess I can just make it right now.
[113:20.02]I need two duck.
[113:22.66]Well, shit.
[113:25.20]You got it.
[113:28.93]Um, I need...
[113:32.66]10, 10, and then one carrot, one onion.
[113:52.89]E3 countdown on the screen.
[113:54.39]Let's get it on the screen.
[113:56.25]No, I don't, I don't care.
[114:06.26]No, I care about E3.
[114:07.82]I just don't care about the countdown to E3.
[114:11.82]I know it's going to happen.
[114:14.33]That's one more extra pepper.
[114:15.39]That's fine.
[114:15.85]Alright, now I need parsley and a carrot.
[114:18.03]Right?
[114:18.21]No, carrot and an onion.
[114:26.17]And then put the two duck breasts in here as well.
[114:29.70]And then grind it up.
[114:34.02]We're good.
[114:34.84]I need two of these.
[114:35.48]That's it.
[114:38.87]What hell... What hell happened over here?
[114:43.15]Skipping... Interconnecting words now.
[114:47.24]Is this on?
[114:52.38]These are clean.
[114:53.55]Yeah, give them up.
[115:09.80]What's been your guys' favorite part about E3 so far?
[115:13.62]And I need full paragraphs.
[115:16.44]If what you write is less than four sentences, you're getting banned from the channel.
[115:32.85]Todd!
[115:33.23]Todd!
[115:33.67]Todd!
[115:34.41]Todd!
[115:35.73]Todd!
[115:36.61]Todd!
[115:37.37]Todd!
[115:38.23]Todd!
[115:39.29]Todd!
[115:46.67]At least I can use these.
[115:51.86]Anybody a Todd fan here?
[115:53.98]Oh, I don't think so.
[115:55.62]I think you're in short company there.
[116:07.06]Alright, get that onion in.
[116:08.24]Is one of these duck breasts not cooking?
[116:18.77]No, get the onion out.
[116:21.11]No reason to have it in.
[116:23.77]Keanu Reeves is probably my favorite part of all the things they showed at E3 this year.
[116:28.65]When he came out on stage and made the references to the game that I liked, I thought it was really fun.
[116:34.13]See, I did a paragraph.
[116:35.27]I pretty much only needed to have like two or three words there, but I told you you're going to get banned if you don't do at least four sentences.
[116:40.68]I'm not going to get banned.
[116:42.48]You might.
[116:44.72]Someone will.
[116:46.46]Okay, take this out.
[116:52.46]Um, I just need to do the broth.
[116:54.73]Pour the broth, get the duck breast out.
[116:57.13]Cut.
[116:58.22]Serve.
[117:15.82]I've really been feeling indifferent about E3 so far.
[117:18.92]I'm not really a Microsoft fan, so the entire show just went past me.
[117:21.52]Yesterday, I only saw the soccer football conference for the FIFA game, and that was the kind of awful, not gonna lie.
[117:25.83]Alright, let's broth it up.
[117:45.72]Yeah, Todd comes out in a Terminator costume.
[117:54.81]Are they making a new Terminator game?
[118:03.89]I'd fucking play it.
[118:18.12]I wonder if they're still gonna be, whatever the game is, still gonna be using the Telltale engine.
[118:22.00]From, like, 2007.
[118:22.42]We'll find out soon enough.
[118:25.98]Alright, it's time... It's time to... The critic is coming today.
[118:40.89]I gotta get everything ready to go.
[118:42.57]Whatever the critic wants, I gotta make fresh.
[118:47.61]I do have some bowls to put out.
[118:49.48]I got duck here.
[118:50.22]Because we're at fame level three.
[118:53.98]I have a full, uh, halibut ready.
[118:57.22]I've got my potato crisps.
[118:59.96]Let me get some bowls out, because... I need the broth.
[119:06.28]I'm ready for the critic.
[119:08.61]Need... gazpacho.
[119:10.79]I gotta make a lot of shit here, don't I?
[119:14.57]Yeah.
[119:15.97]The boar should be fine.
[119:18.68]I can probably fit it into three or four plates.
[119:20.46]And then I need to make some gazpacho.
[119:24.03]Gazpacho, gazpacho, gazpacho.
[119:32.81]Every time I say gazpacho, some of you guys have like your veins pop out of your forehead.
[119:41.39]Calm down, it's okay.
[119:45.59]Just relax, it's not worth getting upset over.
[119:51.55]Like when people call me, like, okay, for instance, my streamer persona video game online media name is Jerma.
[119:58.99]Jerma985, right?
[120:00.51]Don't forget it either.
[120:02.99]I get called sometimes Jerma.
[120:06.42]Oh, hey, Jerma, Jerma.
[120:09.44]It's alright.
[120:09.84]What am I going to corrupt?
[120:11.00]That's fine.
[120:18.70]It's too much in that one.
[120:25.19]People have different ways to pronounce things.
[120:30.21]I know some people are freaking out about pouring with the handle.
[120:33.33]Don't worry.
[120:34.83]It's alright.
[120:35.73]You can call me Jerma.
[120:36.47]You can call me Jerma.
[120:40.30]Call me Joe.
[120:41.00]Alright, I need a bunch of the G one.
[120:58.96]I need to make a little bit more Jermo.
[121:08.90]That's good enough.
[121:12.65]Take this out.
[121:14.17]Hopefully there's not more than two Borsts tomorrow.
[121:17.13]Hopefully the Critic doesn't want it.
[121:24.17]Just remake the soup again with the same pot.
[121:28.98]I need more chicken stock.
[121:31.44]Let's just see if it works.
[121:40.74]These are all empty.
[121:42.40]Why am I still holding on to these?
[121:43.44]Isn't this how grandmothers usually make the food?
[121:53.35]They use the same thing over and over again.
[121:56.27]No, it's still good.
[121:57.21]It's still delicious.
[121:59.73]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[122:00.85]We don't need to go to the grocery store.
[122:07.07]Grandma, the beets are green.
[122:09.64]Extra flavor.
[122:11.14]People eat cheese.
[122:11.90]You eat cheese.
[122:14.12]That's got mold on it.
[122:33.26]I mean, it's hitting all the onions and shit.
[122:36.52]Are you happy you had the onions?
[122:38.84]Are you glad you had the onions?
[122:41.12]Are you happy you had the onions?
[122:42.90]Huh?
[122:43.56]Are you glad you had the onions?
[122:44.52]Alright, we still got time.
[122:59.33]Anybody knows what that's a reference to?
[123:00.53]You get 600 fucking million dollars from my pretend Monopoly bank account that I pretend to send to you through telepathic means as a joke.
[123:16.66]Am I gonna say it?
[123:25.35]Nobody knows that.
[123:26.37]I don't think anybody knows.
[123:28.99]No, it's not from Family Guy.
[123:36.30]There's 6,100 people here.
[123:37.88]Not one person knows this.
[123:43.50]No, it's not from The Simpsons.
[123:47.80]I'm not saying it again.
[123:48.50]Well, it looks like I get to keep my money.
[123:51.33]It was from this Xbox conference.
[123:52.97]Yeah, Phil came out and was talking about how you're happy you had the onions.
[123:56.51]Are you glad you had the onions?
[124:00.51]Alright, what am I doing?
[124:01.19]Uh, I got time.
[124:05.87]Perfect.
[124:06.21]Alright, uh, what was I making?
[124:07.79]Uh, this.
[124:09.31]No, this is all burnt.
[124:11.43]This is not even making the soup correctly, guys.
[124:13.77]It's not gonna work.
[124:21.10]Um... I gotta keep prepping.
[124:24.66]Uh, gazpacho, gazpacho.
[124:26.32]Get this right.
[124:29.24]I'm walking around like an idiot.
[124:37.96]That's some Curb Your Enthusiasm.
[124:39.89]Yep.
[124:40.37]You got... Hold on.
[124:41.11]There you go.
[124:46.03]Spend it wisely.
[124:53.72]And... Did I get... Didn't go in?
[125:11.38]30 and 30, right?
[125:13.24]Yes.
[125:21.84]And then, what is this?
[125:22.42]There's supposed to be salt and pepper at every station.
[125:24.26]There is.
[125:24.52]Ah, shit.
[125:32.36]I thought I didn't get it.
[125:41.91]Come on!
[125:42.59]Get in there!
[125:43.95]What?
[125:44.87]Whatever.
[125:50.42]Gotta get a new joke to pass the time.
[125:54.64]I'm not like a joke factory, guys.
[125:56.30]What do you want me to say?
[125:57.20]I can't just produce.
[126:12.81]Just turn the webcam on.
[126:14.97]No, I can't.
[126:15.49]I can't just produce.
[126:16.99]Under fucking circumstances.
[126:18.09]I've just got to be natural.
[126:32.56]Wait, wait, wait.
[126:32.86]You want to turn the fucking webcam on and start dancing?
[126:36.06]Why would I ever do that?
[126:41.08]What do you think I am?
[126:51.35]A vessel.
[126:53.61]Eh, maybe in your, like, fuckin'... fanfiction.
[126:58.35]This is all burnt, completely.
[126:59.45]That was loud.
[127:18.17]Alright, so.
[127:20.16]I think I'm pretty much ready for the day.
[127:21.22]I got that.
[127:22.48]I'm gonna make up some, what's the meal of the day?
[127:28.59]See, I dumped the hot soup all over me.
[127:31.63]Isn't that like a 10 out of 10 hysterical piece of human comedy?
[127:48.54]Give me the bucket.
[127:50.34]Here comes the critic.
[127:50.95]I'm gonna impress the critic.
[127:52.39]And then at that point, it's gonna be time for the Bethesda... ...Electronic Conference.
[127:57.95]We'll see what the fuck they introduce.
[128:09.17]I'm so looking forward to it.
[128:12.43]My whole life has been leading up to this moment.
[128:17.88]When I get to see Todd Howard come out on stage, clap and go.
[128:22.86]I can't wait.
[128:23.31]It's gonna happen.
[128:23.97]That's the first thing he's gonna do.
[128:29.43]Alright, I think I'm ready to go.
[128:36.05]I am.
[128:38.92]Whatever.
[128:39.24]I'm not gonna make the meat beforehand, because if he wants meat, it has to be fresh.
[128:43.76]I can't just give the critic the crap from the freezer.
[128:49.95]Alright, here we go.
[128:50.43]This is it.
[128:54.09]More exciting than E3.
[128:55.47]That was $916?
[128:56.11]Is that more money than I've ever had?
[129:07.08]I've never received that kind of paycheck right here.
[129:09.10]Alright, we got some skills.
[129:16.38]Alright, cheaper products, liquids, fame boost...
[129:19.71]Is it like a one where critics are less critical?
[129:24.33]Taste tolerance is already up.
[129:28.57]Derpers and gourmets have their expectations lowered.
[129:30.84]Is it a derper?
[129:35.79]Oh, I was going to explain a dream.
[129:36.85]You're right.
[129:37.17]Yep, yep, yep.
[129:37.65]I was going to talk about a dream.
[129:39.01]So I don't know how many of you other guys do this or not, but sometimes this happens to me and it happened like over the course of a few nights.
[129:45.92]So a few nights ago, I had a dream that I broke my brother's golf clubs.
[129:54.73]I don't know why.
[129:56.05]I had a dream that I was like golfing and I snapped the head off.
[129:59.34]I was trying to drive too hard and I was really embarrassed and I was really scared about it.
[130:02.86]I was like, holy shit, this is bad.
[130:04.18]I just broke my brother's fucking like driver.
[130:06.72]It was like a golf club or something.
[130:08.77]So I broke it and then I woke up.
[130:12.29]And I thought that it was real.
[130:14.45]And after like two or three hours, it wasn't really that real anymore.
[130:17.97]I was like, oh, whatever.
[130:18.63]That's weird.
[130:19.29]Was that did that happen?
[130:19.99]Did it not happen?
[130:21.41]Whatever.
[130:21.83]And I forgot about it.
[130:23.25]But like two days later, I had another dream where I replaced the golf clubs.
[130:30.49]And it was so I like I went to the store and I bought golf clubs and I brought them back and I gave them to my brother.
[130:38.28]So I woke up and I'm not kidding.
[130:41.46]I thought that I did a perfect like dream loop where I honestly, to goodness still, even to this day, think it may even be real.
[130:50.79]Like a day later.
[130:52.67]It was so real that I broke the clubs, replaced them over two days.
[130:56.67]And I was going to text him, be like, hey, like I replaced your golf clubs.
[130:59.77]I just want to like, you got them, right?
[131:02.63]I don't know why my brain was going to text him that like this morning.
[131:11.36]You guys ever have like a complete loop where you finish a complete story arc in your brain and you thought it was real?
[131:18.26]Over the course of a couple days?
[131:21.24]That may not have even been a dream.
[131:25.73]Okay, here we go.
[131:30.37]I definitely want that.
[131:32.95]You're just insane.
[131:33.63]You're just a freak.
[131:39.05]At least I replaced him.
[131:42.32]Let's go with less spices.
[131:48.02]Alright, this is it.
[131:49.00]I fucked this up last time.
[131:50.18]Bad.
[131:55.60]You don't have a brother.
[131:58.73]Xpacha's dead.
[131:59.39]Okay, I gotta be ready.
[132:03.27]Those of you that don't know this game, if you don't give the critic at least a four-star dish, he removes almost 150 points from your score, and it takes like two hours to come back.
[132:13.80]It's really bad.
[132:26.53]I don't even play golf.
[132:28.99]I don't even do that.
[132:30.05]I don't play golf at all, ever.
[132:33.00]Alright, let's get right to it.
[132:33.80]I don't even need to prepare.
[132:34.58]Let's go.
[132:34.88]Of course, it's pork chops.
[132:41.92]One thing that I don't have ready to be made.
[132:44.42]But this is not The Critic, so I don't really care that much about it.
[132:49.20]This is what?
[132:49.72]Pepper PTD, right?
[132:51.44]Salt, pepper, and thyme.
[132:53.02]No, it's SBT.
[133:02.85]4-4.
[133:08.02]S-V-T.
[133:10.04]Time.
[133:10.34]Where is it?
[133:12.22]Why is it not on my station?
[133:18.70]You alright?
[133:19.14]Come on.
[133:22.81]What?
[133:23.27]What are you... I just clearly did it.
[133:25.41]I clearly just put it on there.
[133:26.63]You've got to be kidding me.
[133:29.85]Alright.
[133:30.21]30. 30.
[133:36.65]These take a long time, so get it in there.
[133:38.99]And then I also have the potatoes, right?
[133:41.35]Yeah, they're already over here.
[133:54.83]Just gotta wait for that to cook.
[133:57.23]Just stare at it.
[133:59.15]I got one customer in this door.
[134:06.59]Alright, whatever it is, I'm making it fresh for the critic.
[134:15.37]Oh shit, they have to be baked.
[134:21.23]They gotta be baked.
[134:23.25]Just chunked up the potatoes.
[134:27.16]That's 11.
[134:28.34]I keep making that mistake.
[134:31.96]I swear to god.
[134:33.28]It's alright.
[134:37.32]Alright, chunk them up into 50 gram slices.
[134:48.02]I lose this knife every single day.
[134:49.71]Is it on the ground?
[135:05.80]I can't cut it on here.
[135:09.03]Get out of the way.
[135:34.01]It's not the critic.
[135:34.65]I don't care.
[135:49.91]That technique's not going to work here.
[135:54.28]Good.
[135:54.54]Alright.
[135:57.26]Salt.
[136:00.30]E3, E3, E3.
[136:00.92]What do you mean E3?
[136:03.78]E3?
[136:04.38]In 30 minutes.
[136:05.33]It's not right now.
[136:08.13]It's in 30 minutes.
[136:09.93]I'm not missing it.
[136:19.67]No, you guys, it's not even time.
[136:24.42]The pre-show?
[136:25.30]Why do I want to watch the pre-show?
[136:31.30]I AM the pre-show!
[136:41.70]He's not wrong.
[136:44.22]Hey, what just happened to the view count?
[136:47.49]The view count just went to zero.
[136:51.00]Oh, nobody's watching anymore.
[136:53.46]Nobody's here.
[136:54.22]They all left.
[136:56.10]Everybody wanted to go see the pre-show.
[137:03.32]Zero viewers.
[137:15.64]Well, shit.
[137:16.22]Hey, they all came back.
[137:18.80]How was the pre-show?
[137:19.90]Was it any good?
[137:22.50]I knew you'd come back.
[137:23.32]I knew you were going to come back to this channel.
[137:25.46]I mean, come on.
[137:31.38]I can't serve it on this.
[137:32.22]What am I doing?
[137:47.34]I've got to salt these.
[137:48.36]Excuse me.
[137:54.13]Yeah, we've already talked about our E3 impressions.
[137:59.35]What more would you like me to say?
[138:00.83]What do I think is going to happen at Bethesda?
[138:02.19]You want me to give you my insider information that I don't have?
[138:10.35]We've got to pay extra for the pre-show.
[138:11.71]You don't have to pay anything for the pre-show.
[138:16.31]I would be happy if we got a game that had magic in it.
[138:20.47]Like with a wand.
[138:24.01]That's really it.
[138:27.49]Is this the critic?
[138:28.35]No.
[138:33.31]Make sure you start screaming when it's time, because I will forget.
[138:35.55]And I'm going to be late to the conference.
[138:38.20]Alright, this is Salmon.
[138:41.26]I got potatoes already done.
[138:53.74]What's the big thing this year besides the Xbox Alexa?
[139:01.08]Was that it?
[139:05.24]What is Nintendo going to show?
[139:06.64]New Smash Brothers person?
[139:14.80]Cyberpunk?
[139:15.34]Yeah, but we've already seen them.
[139:16.24]Is there anything new that we've never seen before?
[139:22.52]Starfield!
[139:23.52]Oh yeah, they're making us Starfield.
[139:27.29]I completely forgot about that.
[139:34.33]I wonder if... I wonder if they're going to show any gameplay.
[139:45.85]You just activated my Alexa?
[139:47.13]Oh, I'm sorry.
[139:51.71]I forgot.
[139:52.47]I'm on, like, I'm on your speakers at full blast right now.
[140:00.55]How loud do you guys watch this stream?
[140:03.32]You guys have, like, a subwoofer and you just blast it?
[140:05.30]Does the low tones in my voice come out really well?
[140:07.94]I don't know what my spatula is.

[140:48.02]Todd just did a backflip.
[140:49.64]I bet you he can do a backflip.
[140:52.01]I really think he can.
[140:55.96]He doesn't seem like the kind of guy that can do, like, aerials and backflips and... I don't know why I see him on a trapeze.
[141:05.33]Doesn't he... He comes out in one of those, like, circus onesies.
[141:07.95]He's like the kind of, like, trapeze kind of guys, I think.
[141:18.24]He's a nerd.
[141:18.80]You can be a nerd and still use a trapeze.
[141:32.73]I'm not sure what was so bad about that.
[141:34.07]Potatoes?

[145:26.51]What?
[145:37.44]Oh, okay, hold on.
[145:39.28]I made a little gravy just to make it taste a little better.
[145:41.13]That's frozen solid.
[145:50.49]Alright, in the time that I've just been being a dickhead, I could have just done this normally and done it correctly and had a normal amount of stars.
[146:03.20]I can't put this in?
[146:10.88]Just finish it in the oven.
[146:20.16]I already won, it doesn't matter.

[147:12.05]Yeah, but it's like buried somewhere down here.
[147:25.36]It's like mustard on it.
[147:28.88]Well, I don't care.
[147:29.66]I already beat it.
[147:30.50]It doesn't matter.
[147:31.00]I need the salmon right now.
