[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.78]Ooh, Deltarune.
[00:02.80]I got my Deltarune hat on, my Deltarune shirt on, my Deltarune clothes on, my Deltarune everything.
[00:10.64]I've got my Deltarune plushies back here.
[00:20.00]I'm wearing a Star Wars t-shirt.
[00:22.36]Uh, never mind.
[00:24.58]I got a tweet.
[00:24.96]I'll be right back.
[00:25.74]How you doing?
[00:26.08]See you in a minute.
[01:09.83]Okay, so I want to make this really clear.
[01:11.65]This is going to be, for those of you that haven't played Deltarune Chapter 1, this is going to be a spoiler-free playthrough.
[01:17.87]So I can respect the people that haven't done it yet.
[01:21.09]All names will be censored.
[01:23.34]All text will be censored.
[01:26.02]And anytime there's a major, major event on the screen, I'm going to cut to auto.
[01:31.34]So I'm just, I want to, you know, make sure you guys understand.
[01:37.61]Now I'm ready to go.
[01:39.89]I did run up here though, I'm a little winded.
[01:44.64]I always open up... So I'm on my phone.
[01:47.44]I'll just take a look at the, uh... The clock app.
[01:52.66]And the second hand is on the 6.
[01:53.88]And it's just going around and I know that it's almost 2.
[01:56.96]And I go, oh fuck, I gotta get up in that room.
[02:02.01]And turn the stream on before the second hand hits the 12 up there.
[02:09.03]Almost made it.
[02:12.39]Very close.
[02:20.59]Yeah, your house has two floors?
[02:22.58]Five.
[02:28.32]What are you talking about?
[02:31.38]Takes me about four minutes to run up and down the stairs.
[02:37.57]No, I don't live in a five-story house.
[02:39.55]I would never want to live in a five-story house.
[02:44.05]Have I talked about my, like, anxiety with living in a big house?
[02:46.99]Or a bigger place?
[02:48.23]It's scary.
[02:48.77]I hate it.
[02:51.09]The bigger your house is, the more places for a murderer to come in and, like, hide in your eighth bedroom while you're brushing your teeth in bedroom two.
[03:01.62]And you might not even fucking hear them come in.
[03:03.50]Nope.
[03:04.18]No thanks.
[03:06.48]I want to be able to be completely aware of every single space in my place of residence.
[03:14.33]If somebody's scratching at the door, 20 feet away, I want to be able to fucking hear it.
[03:21.39]I'm not gonna be in living room 4 and not know what's going on in living room 2.
[03:36.08]Paranoid.
[03:38.00]That's fine.
[03:38.70]That's alright.
[03:39.22]They set up baby monitors everywhere?
[03:48.32]I don't know.
[03:48.68]I don't want to play Five Nights at Freddy's in my own house.
[03:52.38]No, I don't want to do that.
[03:56.48]That's when fucking chickens gonna jump out of my face.
[03:59.86]I don't want to do that.
[04:04.50]No, I want to be very aware of my surroundings at all times.
[04:07.94]I live in a 4x4 house.
[04:16.19]Aren't you scared of ovens too?
[04:18.91]I'm not scared of ovens.
[04:20.93]I'm scared of how ovens operate.
[04:24.61]It's weird.
[04:26.15]Something about it just freaks me out.
[04:27.41]I don't know why.
[04:31.58]The fact that there is a box in your house that heats up to hundreds of degrees with gas.
[04:40.09]It's just, I don't know, something about it irrationally is uncomfortable to me.
[04:45.25]I don't know why.
[04:52.72]That's a recycled bit?
[04:54.58]No, no, these are not recycled bits.
[04:56.74]Hey, I can recycle a bit when there's way more people that are here than last time I talked about the oven routine, okay?
[05:05.19]Two years ago when I talked about my fear of ovens, like 4,000 of you weren't here.
[05:10.87]So I get to do it again.
[05:12.77]Every additional viewer that's added to this stream, I get to redo a joke because that person hasn't heard it yet.
[05:19.89]That was a few months ago.
[05:26.48]Oops.
[05:30.68]You're environmentally conscious with your jokes.
[05:36.29]I gotta keep my joke carbon footprint down.
[05:44.79]That was definitely more than a few months ago.
[05:46.35]I don't know.
[05:47.19]I have no idea.
[05:50.51]I wonder how many words I've said on stream and on YouTube.
[05:55.23]How many actually single words have I spoken?
[05:58.66]You have to be talking about like tens of millions, hundreds of millions of words that have been spoken into a microphone.
[06:05.52]I can't keep track of them all, of everything I've ever said.
[06:07.78]How am I supposed to do that?
[06:10.22]The oven routine is a recycled bit.
[06:12.26]Yeah, since the oven routine, I have said 745 million words.
[06:19.09]Think about that.
[06:21.15]Really think about that for a second.
[06:22.63]It's important.
[06:23.39]It's important.
[06:27.49]Somebody has to count it.
[06:28.49]I hope nobody does do that.
[06:30.89]That's way too much work for something, so that is not important at all.
[06:40.03]Half of your words are filler.
[06:43.01]Yeah, because I have so much to say that my brain has to catch up for a second.
[06:48.24]My left hemisphere and my right hemisphere are the tortoise and the hare.
[06:54.88]They're both competing at the same time.
[06:56.74]Like, one of them runs real fast, and the other one takes like 20 minutes to get there.
[06:59.82]Play the game?
[07:05.16]It's been seven minutes, which is... Get out of here.
[07:12.80]Play the game.
[07:13.68]I'm gonna play the game.
[07:15.18]I'm excited about this one.
[07:21.31]Impatient Andy.
[07:23.26]Yeah, just chill.
[07:24.26]We're just hanging out.
[07:28.56]VOD watchers, skip.
[07:31.58]Well, that's the privilege of being a VOD watcher versus a live viewer.
[07:35.67]A VOD watcher right now was able to go like this.
[07:43.09]Okay, so we're going to play Deltarune now.
[07:47.07]We're going to start the game now.
[07:49.24]But you guys are here live.
[07:50.96]You have to, you have to put up with me in real time.
[07:55.26]So I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.
[08:04.21]I've been waiting for this.
[08:08.03]Yeah.
[08:09.31]I'm excited.
[08:09.81]I did my refresher course.
[08:13.37]I remember everything pretty much.
[08:16.67]Done.
[08:16.97]I've seen everything I need to see.
[08:18.13]I am refreshed for Deltarune Chapter 2.
[08:21.23]By the way, this is Chapter 2, so if you don't know what this is... I don't know if you want to be here, but maybe you do.
[08:31.72]You say... Wait, what is it?
[08:33.71]You say 1 to 7 words per second.
[08:35.49]So that's 6,120 words per hour.
[08:43.59]Okay.
[08:44.89]So 6,120 words an hour times like five hours.
[08:52.67]I'm talking about like what?
[08:53.45]30,000 to 40,000 words said on stream, per stream, times 1,000 is like 350 million words or something.
[09:05.56]I don't know.
[09:06.34]Somebody will figure it out.
[09:08.98]I say way more than one or two, no way.
[09:11.76]I say way more than that.
[09:12.54]Alright, you guys ready for Deltarune chapter two?
[09:22.47]See, now I'm fucked up now.
[09:23.65]Now I'm gonna try to say more words a second to, like, bump my score.
[09:28.61]What happened to my audio?
[09:36.66]Where's my audio?
[09:38.63]Alright, so I played this on different computers, so on my streaming setup is not- I don't have the old files.
[09:45.21]So just pretend like it's the same file.
[09:47.91]But I heard- everything I said, you don't have to be playing on the same file, it's fine.
[09:53.58]He's muted.
[09:54.06]No, I'm not.
[09:57.44]How does this work?
[10:01.50]Where's my audio?
[10:02.60]Oh shit, that's why.
[10:03.48]Oops.
[10:08.87]He didn't kill... Wait, hold on.
[10:10.83]Make sure everyone... Who cares?
[10:12.27]You're at episode two.
[10:13.42]I can say it, okay?
[10:15.92]Why am I so concerned about saying this?
[10:20.60]This is... You're here at episode two.
[10:23.86]I have to imply that you've seen episode one or played episode one, right?
[10:27.83]Like, what am I talking about?
[10:28.81]And this has been out for a week.
[10:30.47]I'm always the last person on Twitch to play these games.
[10:33.07]The new ones that come out.
[10:35.31]So I didn't play... I didn't beat Jevil on this save file.
[10:39.14]Oh.
[10:41.56]Oh, well.
[10:46.50]I mean, I... If you didn't, if you don't know, I'm one of, I think, of six people on Twitch, or maybe six people in the world, that beat Jevil on their first try.
[10:58.28]First try, no bullshit, did it first try with nothing, no bullshit.
[11:02.20]I'm one of six people, I think, in North America.
[11:06.73]From my understanding.
[11:12.90]Stream is ruined.
[11:16.18]No spoilers?
[11:16.94]Alright, let's go.
[11:18.85]Let's go.
[11:19.35]I'm ready.
[11:19.67]Let me start.
[11:23.91]What was my name in the last save file?
[11:25.65]I don't remember.
[11:26.67]Can anyone look it up?
[11:34.06]What was my name?
[11:36.44]I made this was my name?
[11:37.46]That's such an old joke though.
[11:41.10]That's so old.
[11:44.74]It's been three years.
[11:45.87]Are we gonna really go back to, like, three years ago comedy on Twitch?
[11:51.91]Hey, Onimos.
[11:53.31]Thanks for the 20 subs.
[11:54.03]Appreciate it.
[11:55.07]20 community subs.
[11:59.52]Recycled joke.
[12:00.32]Alright, I'm just gonna... Whatever.
[12:01.68]Doesn't really matter.
[12:05.33]I'm using a controller too.
[12:06.29]I know.
[12:08.19]Shut up.
[12:09.64]Everybody relax.
[12:10.44]I'm using a controller.
[12:11.46]I know.
[12:11.70]I just like everyone just fucking spit out their dinner.
[12:14.56]Relax.
[12:21.19]Oak Recycler Andy.
[12:22.55]Okay.
[12:22.95]I'm just going to do my name.
[12:24.25]Whatever.
[12:24.55]Who cares?
[12:36.73]Is this your name?
[12:37.31]Yes.
[12:37.53]Alright, here we go.
[12:42.25]So, last thing, remember, Chris ripped the fucking heart out, put the heart in the cage, took a knife out, and we went, holy smokes, what's gonna happen in chapter two?
[12:51.04]Let's find out!
[12:52.40]YouTuber voice.
[12:55.44]Chris, honey, are you awake?
[12:59.80]Wait.
[13:02.06]Is that, uh, a knife?
[13:07.03]No!
[13:07.99]Wait, what?
[13:08.43]What the fuck?
[13:13.29]Chris, did you eat all the pie?
[13:14.44]It is your knife in this empty tin, is it not?
[13:23.80]Ah, I see, huh.
[13:25.82]Oh, Chris.
[13:28.68]Brightness?
[13:30.10]Oh, wait, you're right.
[13:31.73]This is from The Sims.
[13:39.68]If you wanna know how fucking lazy of a, quote, content creator.
[13:44.57]Oh, content creator.
[13:46.05]I haven't opened OBS in eight days.
[13:51.03]You understand?
[13:51.91]Like, do you get it?
[13:52.92]I'm sure you guys get it, right?
[13:59.90]Alright, well, that's fixed.
[14:01.02]Looks good.
[14:04.79]Oh, what do you do?
[14:05.33]Yeah, I'm a content creator.
[14:06.49]Yeah, content creator.
[14:08.11]Influencer.
[14:09.53]Oh, nice.
[14:10.03]So you must be, like, really active.
[14:11.92]Well, yeah.
[14:12.66]I mean, I opened the program more than a week and a half ago.
[14:16.82]I played The Sims 3 with some mods.
[14:18.78]Fuck it.
[14:19.14]I just didn't even open it ever again.
[14:22.72]Until the next time, 20 minutes before I had to stream next.
[14:27.01]Oh, man.
[14:27.47]Okay.
[14:28.43]You're a content creator.
[14:29.71]Yeah.
[14:34.05]Okay.
[14:39.47]Let's go.
[14:42.69]Oh, Chris.
[14:44.34]Am I going to have to lock the oven again?
[14:45.78]I don't want you to touch the oven because I don't like the oven.
[14:51.00]Well, hurry out of bed, it's time for school.
[14:52.72]Yeah, so in the last chapter, you go to school, you sit down with one of your classmates, and you end up going into a portal in the supply closet, and then you have to fight the dark prince in the dark portal and everything, and then you come back, and... Okay, good.
[15:16.50]We get it.
[15:18.19]Play the game.
[15:18.85]No, I'm going to milk this for like seven hours because I've been waiting for this.
[15:25.55]It's $5 in your brother's draw.
[15:26.97]Take it.
[15:31.58]I mean, it's $5.
[15:34.58]It's $5.
[15:34.90]I'll put $10 back in a week.
[15:39.88]That's the play.
[15:45.61]It's a birdcage.
[15:46.37]When the door is closed, there's no escape.
[15:52.30]On the computer's desktop is a folder called Epic Games Stuff.
[15:56.52]It's a poorly drawn design for a game.
[15:59.89]It seems the last boss is a creature with giant rainbow wings.
[16:04.35]Okay.
[16:04.45]It doesn't seem like this game ever saw the light of day.
[16:09.19]Is this an unreleased game?
[16:22.16]Fortnite?
[16:23.18]No.
[16:28.38]There's no time to read books just generally.
[16:32.15]Yeah.
[16:33.83]That's like really, that's a good point.
[16:36.57]How to draw dragons is at the bottom of the draw.
[16:39.41]The purple character on the cover is dressed immodestly.
[16:42.39]Hmm.
[16:45.57]Your brother will never return this book.
[16:51.13]Door's locked.
[16:58.55]Oh, by the way, I gotta say this really, really importantly.
[17:00.65]The backseat policy on this stream is as follows.
[17:06.56]If I request help specifically, if I request help, if I say, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, somebody help me, you're free to spam whatever you want in the chat that has anything to do with what I asked.
[17:18.26]If you say a spoiler of this game in the chat room, you are going to get just nuked by the mods.
[17:25.86]If there's like a spoiler in the chat, gone.
[17:28.46]And you're gone too.
[17:29.76]And you're never coming back.
[17:31.46]Okay?
[17:35.43]So where the fuck do I go?
[17:37.17]Where do I go?
[17:38.39]I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.
[17:39.65]Where do I go from here?
[17:48.80]I'm in one of those fucking moods today.
[17:50.34]I am.
[17:50.92]Good luck.
[17:53.01]It's a landline phone, but you already have a cell phone.
[17:55.69]Okay.
[17:59.91]It's the TV.
[18:00.51]It looks like it's plugged in, but it's dusty.
[18:03.95]Is it a crack stream?
[18:04.91]It might be.
[18:06.58]It's Charial, the beloved living room chair.
[18:13.98]Well, shall we go?
[18:14.70]To school, right?
[18:16.38]Yeah.
[18:23.56]Chris, there you are.
[18:25.80]Even Susie showed up before you.
[18:28.06]Hey, Chris.
[18:35.46]If I knew you were going to be late, I wouldn't have showed up on time.
[18:41.30]Susie, please don't kick your desk.
[18:43.70]Treat school property like you treat people.
[18:45.72]Okay.
[18:47.87]This time I'll aim for the vitals.
[18:54.60]That's not what I... In any case, good morning, class.
[18:58.51]We have a lot to go over today.
[19:01.15]First, we're starting the reading from page 142.
[19:05.63]Any volunteers?
[19:11.19]I guess I could read the... Ah, trouble yourself not, Noel.
[19:16.51]I will valiantly take this blow of humiliation.
[19:20.60]That's okay.
[19:21.42]I can... Ahem.
[19:25.10]Page 142.
[19:26.62]It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
[19:29.87]Times were pretty good, times were pretty bad.
[19:32.69]Mediocre times, iffy times, so-so times.
[19:37.31]Listening to this, your eyes begin to close automatically.
[19:40.19]Three voices, Omega L. Ban that guy for a week.
[19:43.13]Listen to this, your eyes begin to close.
[19:48.54]Have a nice day, everyone.
[19:51.32]And please remember, your group projects...
[19:54.98]Oh, um, Chris, are you okay?
[19:57.80]You were, um, sleeping all class.
[20:01.26]Don't worry.
[20:01.94]I'm not mad.
[20:02.80]Just concerned.
[20:04.52]Usually, you only sleep through the start.
[20:06.86]Good luck and rest well tonight.
[20:09.94]Okay?
[20:12.26]Slept through class?
[20:15.84]How many voices you got?
[20:19.44]That's always such a stupid thing.
[20:21.50]Oh, yeah?
[20:22.14]How many can you do?
[20:26.88]I'm not trying to do them, right?
[20:29.68]Oh, you think I'm so bad at that?
[20:30.98]What do you have?
[20:32.46]I don't know.
[20:32.80]I'm not doing the thing you're doing.
[20:35.68]I'm a fucking doctor, dude.
[20:38.61]You're an e-clown and you have three voices?
[20:43.03]When you come in for a checkup at the doctor's appointment, I don't stick the thing up your nose and then tell you to leave.
[20:51.12]And then say you have nose hairs.
[20:53.12]I've got like ten things I can diagnose on you.
[21:01.96]Actually, they do.
[21:04.52]Wait!
[21:05.08]I'm supposed to be in the reverse!
[21:06.34]Fuck, I fucked it up.
[21:07.76]Specialists are doctors that, like, there's a nose doctor, right?
[21:11.24]And all he does is look at your nose.
[21:13.00]I said it completely backwards.
[21:14.48]It was completely backwards.
[21:15.32]I meant it the other way.
[21:16.66]I've ruined everything.
[21:17.56]I actually meant to say it the other way.
[21:21.12]There's a nose doctor that looks only at your nose, so if you only do the nose doctor routine, it's fine.
[21:28.13]So if I can do one, two, three voices really good, that's fine.
[21:32.08]Because I can do them really good.
[21:34.36]I fucked up the whole routine.
[21:36.66]You didn't lose sleep over it, did you?
[21:41.98]Lost sleep from being Susie's partner.
[21:43.72]Actually, my sleep quality increased.
[21:49.99]Who is he talking to?
[21:53.29]You.
[21:55.09]Which one?
[21:55.75]Which one?
[21:58.48]Should I do the first one?
[22:05.78]Actually, my sleep quality increased.
[22:06.98]I'm going to say lost sleep from... Actually, my sleep quality increased.
[22:12.13]Chris, that's good, I think.
[22:15.39]Maybe you were just staying up late talking to Asriel online again.
[22:21.15]Ah, wait.
[22:21.69]You can't do that, right?
[22:24.68]I hope the internet gets fixed soon.
[22:27.52]The internet doesn't work?
[22:29.38]I don't want to revert into my primal form.
[22:34.79]Wait.
[22:36.25]Oh, wait.
[22:39.07]Oh.
[22:40.11]Okay.
[22:42.11]What does that mean?
[22:48.18]Oh, look who it is.
[22:49.10]The school zombie.
[22:50.96]You're sleeping like a corpse all class.
[22:54.25]Heh.
[22:55.29]What's the matter?
[22:56.51]Had trouble going to beddy-bye last night?
[23:00.70]Heh.
[23:02.36]Me too, Chris!
[23:03.48]Like I could sleep after yesterday!
[23:05.84]Just waiting for today felt like years!
[23:08.34]Did all that stuff really happen?
[23:10.44]Lancer, Rousey, everyone, are they, are they, uh... Look, you've been wondering the same thing, right?
[23:17.84]Come on already!
[23:25.32]So do we just go back into the supply?
[23:27.38]Where's the portal show up?
[23:29.42]Moment of truth.
[23:30.56]Everything we've been waiting for is just behind this.
[23:34.18]We open this and there's nothing inside.
[23:36.90]Will we still be... Screw it.
[23:39.98]Let's just open it already.
[23:43.12]Um, Susie?
[23:46.30]Yeah?
[23:46.56]Noelle, hey.
[23:51.27]What the hell are you doing here?
[23:54.14]Um, so sorry to bother you, but, um, I... Well, I just... Birdly and I were going to the library to do some research for our group projects, and... If it's okay, um, would you, uh, would you want to come, too?
[24:08.03]Oh, Chris, you can come, too, I mean.
[24:12.03]Uh, I mean, like, uh, busy with, um... Chris, help me.
[24:19.59]What do we do?
[24:19.98]What do I do?
[24:23.50]Rhyme.
[24:24.78]Hanging out alone in the closet.
[24:26.24]We were doing rhyme.
[24:33.87]Uh.
[24:36.42]Both of these, okay.
[24:37.52]Um, I'm gonna say we were doing, I don't, I'm gonna say we were doing crime.
[24:41.64]You know, just committing crimes.
[24:44.22]Just gonna do some crimes and go to jail.
[24:46.79]Forever.
[24:47.13]It sucks.
[24:50.11]That's funny.
[24:51.21]What?
[24:51.99]Oh, well, that sounds, uh, just have fun, you two.
[24:55.53]I'll be at the library.
[24:56.83]Of course, if you could bring her by later, it would mean a lot to me.
[25:06.06]Wait, Chris, what the hell was that?
[25:08.14]Why would Noelle ask me to do homework with her?
[25:12.22]That wish much?
[25:13.04]Does she want to fail?
[25:16.50]Wait a second.
[25:17.32]Wait a second.
[25:18.68]Chris, did you notice how nervous she was?
[25:20.88]And, like, blushing and stuff?
[25:23.25]Chris, you don't think that she, uh... She's onto our secret identities.
[25:29.25]You know, this dark world stuff.
[25:31.39]Damn, we gotta keep this under wraps, Chris.
[25:33.87]This is our thing, you know?
[25:36.83]Anyway, enough waiting already, right?
[25:38.65]Let's go!
[25:39.09]So this is just here.
[25:45.41]Still here.
[25:58.23]Cool, alright.
[26:01.34]And ladies and gentlemen, welcome to DELTARUNE Chapter 2.
[26:06.23]I'm your host for this festivitiesdrama985.
[26:09.19]I'm looking forward to it.
[26:12.29]Hey Chris, you really want to walk everywhere so slowly?
[26:18.19]I know you're kind of taking it in, but you can run, you know.
[26:22.08]You remembered something about the B button.
[26:25.48]Oh, right.
[26:26.26]I already said shut up, man.
[26:33.91]What's the over-under of me ruining the Deltarune and Undertale for half the people here?
[26:39.03]I hope it's not that high, because I love this franchise just like you.
[26:42.29]Just like you.
[26:44.27]Here we are.
[26:47.29]Chris!
[26:47.89]Susie!
[26:48.98]It's been ever so long!
[26:50.06]Yeah, yeah, it's been, what, a day?
[26:54.70]Oh, that is short, isn't it?
[26:56.86]It's just that I've never had friends before.
[26:59.68]So I've never waited so long to see them again, either.
[27:03.64]Fine, I guess we'll try not to let you die of loneliness.
[27:07.44]I bet Lancer wants to see us too, right?
[27:12.16]Hey, wait a second.
[27:14.06]Where is Lancer?
[27:17.90]Where's everybody?
[27:18.70]Well, worry not, Susie.
[27:21.90]You'll see them in a moment.
[27:23.62]Just wait here, alright?
[27:24.60]Aaron!
[27:26.62]Okay.
[27:27.51]Hey, this better not be some kind of prank or something.
[27:29.45]Of course, I have something to ask you.
[27:34.64]I need you to return to the light world and go to the old classroom to the east of the closet doors.
[27:41.64]Inside, gather everything on the ground and bring it back here, could you?
[27:46.38]Go to the light world?
[27:51.08]Wait, I just got here.
[27:51.94]Can I just not listen?
[27:56.32]Wait, this is a safe point.
[27:59.39]You look upon the castle you first saw yesterday.
[28:01.34]You're filled with the power of immediate nostalgia.
[28:04.22]Save.
[28:07.22]Here we are.
[28:08.36]File saved.
[28:11.83]Cool.
[28:12.49]Alright, so, uh, should I just listen?
[28:19.95]Okay, go to the east of the closet door and pick up stuff.
[28:22.52]I'm just gonna do it.
[28:24.02]Whatever.
[28:24.28]I'm just gonna listen.
[28:33.06]Are you level 2?
[28:33.94]I don't know.
[28:35.86]Okay, east of the closet door.
[28:39.88]Door is locked.
[28:47.20]Oops.
[28:51.31]Shit.
[28:55.23]I live on the west coast of the United States, guys.
[28:58.45]I don't know.
[28:59.93]It's... It's... I know.
[29:02.19]Listen.
[29:02.33]Listen.
[29:04.27]I told you I got the two hemispheres.
[29:07.15]Like, the tortoise is the one that processes information.
[29:11.07]And the hare is the one that makes all the stupid fucking voices you hear every day.
[29:14.83]Right?
[29:16.25]All, like, the dumb things that I say is the hare running as fast as he can.
[29:19.83]The tortoise needs, like, extra time to even process what's happening on the screen.
[29:25.09]They're constantly in conflict with each other.
[29:28.97]They got the junk off the floor.
[29:31.43]Or did they do a giant dusty ball?
[29:38.71]Okay.
[29:39.81]What's in here?
[29:41.07]Managed to cram everything into the closet, even the rug.
[29:45.34]Light?
[29:46.46]Shock board?
[29:47.94]Door is locked.
[29:49.40]What am I talking about?
[29:50.36]Well, you weren't here... Okay, that person was... People that are saying, what are you talking about, weren't here ten minutes ago.
[30:00.02]You can't jump halfway into, like, Infinity War and ask who Thanos is.
[30:06.83]Hey, Chris, so where is every...
[30:09.96]One.
[30:16.73]There he is!
[30:17.89]Guess who's back, clowns?
[30:20.35]Lancer!
[30:20.79]I don't remember the voices I did, but I'll try.
[30:23.03]Hey, Chris, don't know what you did, but hell yeah!
[30:27.65]Everyone's here!
[30:28.23]I don't know what happened to Lancer's castle.
[30:36.71]All gone.
[30:38.92]Gone?
[30:40.62]Right.
[30:41.28]When Chris sealed the fountain, that dark world disappeared and turned back into a normal classroom.
[30:49.29]Where's Lancer going to live now?
[30:50.43]Don't worry, Susie.
[30:53.27]We'll conquer Rouseleys.
[30:55.05]Rouseleys.
[30:56.19]Rouseleys.
[30:57.23]I can't say this word in this place.
[30:58.75]Rouseleys.
[31:00.05]Castle is our own.
[31:01.06]Rouseleys.
[31:04.56]Rouseleys.
[31:06.87]Chris, as you bring Dark World denizens back here, the power of our fountain will transform this town more and more.
[31:14.55]From now on, the enemies we spare will be recruited to our town.
[31:20.58]So let's keep sparing enemies, okay?
[31:25.94]Anyhow, why don't we all have a look around?
[31:28.32]We can head north towards the castle.
[31:30.20]I have a special surprise to show you there.
[31:34.04]Not if I surprised myself first!
[31:36.68]Last one there is a fresh and fragrant egg.
[31:42.69]Come on, Chris.
[31:43.19]You're going to let him beat us?
[31:50.49]Beat us?
[31:52.03]I thought you were racing.
[31:52.91]Yeah, I want to be the egg.
[31:58.06]It's funny.
[31:59.32]The castle town is transformed from the power of friendship.
[32:01.80]You're filled with the power of friendship-based architecture.
[32:07.24]Recruits?
[32:07.82]There's recruits now?
[32:13.20]Okay.
[32:15.08]It's a manual.
[32:15.80]Read a topic.
[32:17.74]Recruits.
[32:18.28]I'm curious.
[32:18.73]Huh.
[32:37.65]Okay.
[32:38.95]Interesting.
[32:39.27]Can I go in the cafe?
[32:46.39]Mamma Miba.
[32:47.61]I wanted to run the bakery, but someone is already working there.
[32:51.59]A cafe that serves pastries?
[32:53.01]What a disgrace.
[32:54.43]What sort of humiliating thing will happen next?
[32:58.68]Check recruits.
[33:04.58]Um...
[33:09.07]A real dust bunny.
[33:10.13]Known to play dirty, but loves to play clean.
[33:12.15]Dislikes vacuums.
[33:13.19]Likes dusty places.
[33:15.19]Do these people join the party?
[33:16.33]Are these the enemies from last chapter?
[33:19.85]Yeah.
[33:20.27]But so I can place?
[33:24.59]Oh.
[33:25.03]They just hang out here?
[33:25.91]That's cool.
[33:29.08]Place.
[33:29.48]Okay.
[33:33.36]Alright.
[33:33.56]Who do I want?
[33:37.38]I kind of like Rudin.
[33:40.06]Uh, I definitely like Rabbic.
[33:41.36]Okay, Bloxer.
[33:47.08]Okay.
[33:56.81]Pawnman, level 3?
[33:57.47]How's Pawnman level 3?
[33:59.63]Oh, it doesn't matter.
[34:00.15]Okay.
[34:00.49]And, uh, I like Jigsaw-y.
[34:01.61]Yeah, I like this group.
[34:03.58]Can we talk to them?
[34:05.96]Looks like it wants to be dabbed with rubbing alcohol.
[34:08.60]Mm-hmm.
[34:12.22]I'm an aide, please?
[34:15.40]Everything tastes better with a normally shaped body.
[34:21.06]Hey, boss.
[34:22.38]I'll have a dark candy star fate.
[34:24.34]Okay, cool.
[34:28.00]So they can just hang out here.
[34:30.73]What are your thoughts on the Mario movie?
[34:34.13]It'll have an 81 on Rotten Tomatoes.
[34:46.03]Alright, we're at the bakery.
[34:46.99]Oh wait, this is, um... Wasn't this?
[34:49.35]Yeah, this is the bad guy, but he wasn't.
[34:51.53]Ah, thou hast transplantedeth us to thine castle town, and truly a magnificent town of castles it art.
[35:00.58]But ho!
[35:01.20]Hmm, something art lacking it feeleth.

[35:14.81]Cool.
[35:15.47]Party dojo.
[35:16.21]Wait, I didn't even go in here.
[35:19.83]Oh, wait.
[35:21.83]Welcome to Top Bakery.
[35:22.96]Our special chefs spin baked goods at the top of their class.
[35:26.76]Who are you?
[35:28.40]Seems like Hattie likes this place.
[35:29.90]She hopes you'll like it too.
[35:35.45]Can I go in the party dojo?
[35:36.97]I can.
[35:37.67]Oh, cool.
[35:38.17]Alright, this is cool.
[35:41.84]It's a bed for three people or one three-headed person.
[35:46.00]Oh.
[35:47.40]Wow, our house is a dojo.
[35:48.66]Makes me want to fight.
[35:50.24]Can we go to sleep?
[35:50.94]Finally, a dojo for people that are normal-shaped.
[35:54.90]I will train myself for the tournament.
[36:08.28]hey boss boss hey I'm so glad to have a nice boss I could shed a tear but I won't I'm on the job I'll cry at home with the kids boss you're so strong but there's always time to learn next step after tutorials is training so me and the boys got you together a dojo complete our battle challenges and get some fabulous prizes meanwhile you might get a little bit of tougher we're gonna make you the strongest boss
[36:36.24]um learn how to spare like a champ jigsaw Joe graze challenge one or clover rematch jigsaw Joe Joe's life savings awesome okay
[36:56.38]You can act and spare on the same turn.
[36:58.78]If you know Chris's act will give an enemy 100% mercy, spare them on the same turn with Susie or Ralsei.
[37:06.43]Jigsaw Joe, Jigzin.
[37:07.91]Okay.
[37:09.53]So this is Chris.
[37:11.13]Uh, we're gonna do Jigsaw Joe.
[37:14.21]Uh, act.
[37:15.43]Jigsaw Joe, shave.
[37:19.28]Jigsaw Joe, Jigzin.
[37:20.24]Okay, and then... Spare?
[37:21.98]Jigsaw Joe?
[37:23.00]Spare?
[37:26.31]Okay, and then, what about you?
[37:27.87]Magic?
[37:28.39]Or should I try Spare?
[37:30.69]See what happens.
[37:31.73]Shave Jigsaw Joe's stubble.
[37:35.97]Susie, spare Jigsaw Joe.
[37:38.03]Rousey, spare Jigsaw Joe.
[37:39.72]Oh, boss, you're sparing me!
[37:44.60]Wait a second, I got something else to remind you of.
[37:47.02]Boss!
[37:48.00]It works the same with making an enemy tired.
[37:50.93]If an Act will make an enemy tired, use Ralsei's Pacify right away.
[37:54.95]Of course, Pacify is magic, so you'll need TP.
[37:57.57]Spend a turn defending to gain TP if you have to, boss.
[38:02.19]Okay, looks like you could use a Bedtime Story.
[38:04.37]So we're, uh... We're gonna do Act, or... We saw Joe.
[38:10.00]Sleepy Story.
[38:12.49]Exodro looks like he could use a bedtime story, and then we're gonna do, um, pacify, right?
[38:16.80]Oh, wait, no.
[38:18.28]Wait, no, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[38:19.32]Defend.
[38:20.58]Defend.
[38:22.58]Oh, no, no.
[38:23.52]Defend, defend.
[38:24.12]Um, pacify.
[38:27.68]Wait.
[38:31.57]Oh, no, you're gonna- Okay, sleep.
[38:32.53]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:33.55]I mean, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:34.87]I don't- We don't need TP to do that?
[38:37.33]Oh, it's an act.
[38:37.95]Okay, I thought we needed TP for some reason.
[38:41.43]Alright, we're good.
[38:46.77]Alright, she came tired, and then Rousey cast Pacify, and you're done.
[38:54.47]You managed to spare enemies right away.
[38:56.08]Battles will go a lot faster.
[38:57.64]Okay.
[39:01.04]Here's your reward.
[39:01.90]My entire life savings.
[39:03.84]One dollar.
[39:04.32]Alright, let's see.
[39:11.27]Should I do another one?
[39:13.51]Raise challenge one.
[39:14.63]Get 100% TP without getting hit.
[39:18.37]These are like challenges.
[39:19.12]We're gonna do this later.
[39:21.32]I'm Battles Master.
[39:22.42]Ask me about battles.
[39:24.14]Grazing, hitbox, nothing.
[39:26.14]I think I remember a lot of this stuff.
[39:27.86]Grazing is if a projectile comes really close but doesn't touch you.
[39:32.93]You get like something for it, right?
[39:34.77]TP or something.
[39:36.79]It's hole.
[39:38.11]We failed to hit our funding goal.
[39:40.01]I will not talk about our hole.
[39:41.31]Okay.
[39:44.72]What?
[39:45.36]What?
[39:47.49]Shots aren't always as they appear.
[39:48.91]The bigger they are, the less to fear.
[39:51.65]You'll only get hurt a little inside.
[39:53.65]Take your pride and learn the size.
[39:55.65]Somebody said you're going to get 12 hours out of this at your pace.
[40:02.01]I'm not like... I'm doing what I want.
[40:05.04]When shots aim directly, try to move slow.
[40:06.88]Yeah, because if it almost hits you...
[40:19.74]Move it bit by bit, you'll gain TP.
[40:21.51]That's what it is.
[40:24.09]I'm going to take my time.
[40:25.19]I'm excited for this.
[40:28.19]I love Undertale.
[40:28.93]It's a great series.
[40:29.95]It's a really cool game.
[40:31.95]And I like Deltarune in the first chapter, so I'm going to enjoy the second chapter.
[40:35.55]That means I'm not going to AAA to get through this as fast as I can.
[40:39.42]I'm going to talk to townspeople.
[40:41.20]I'm sorry, that's how it is.
[40:43.30]I'm just a block.
[40:46.62]Ooh, the shop.
[40:47.04]What's in here?
[40:49.39]Welcome, travelers!
[40:52.69]Handy, that's a heal.
[40:54.18]Dark burger.
[40:55.90]Amber card.
[40:57.12]Armored defensive charm.
[40:58.56]Spooky sword.
[40:59.30]Okay, cool.
[41:01.40]Let's talk.
[41:03.84]So we are now in the castle town.
[41:05.37]Well, now it makes no difference to me.
[41:07.03]As long as I stay in my shop, these walls won't change.
[41:12.49]You don't have your jevel item.
[41:16.28]No, I don't.
[41:18.08]Well... In a way, I suppose it's just a little bit amusing to see you again.
[41:22.71]I'm sure you three will have an interesting journey.
[41:25.47]Me?
[41:26.49]I'll just be here offering the same old junk.
[41:29.13]As you find stronger treasure, I'm sure you'll have little reason to return here.
[41:32.13]If you have some time, I'll offer you a biscuit and a hint.
[41:37.58]Do I have a hint?
[41:40.08]The little prince has something to show you in his castle.
[41:42.80]Well now, are you going to turn down a royal invitation?
[41:46.89]he again okay cool talk to you I talk to you oh thou has transplanted this to the sign castle town I already talked to you already
[42:19.24]This way.
[42:22.65]Oh, it's quite a wonderful town, really.
[42:24.27]Thank you.
[42:25.79]So why am I alone here?
[42:26.91]A bit of self-reflection, I suppose.
[42:29.71]I do realize I was quite a coward before.
[42:32.83]So I wanted to say, well, I still am.
[42:36.34]My cards, I cannot handle society.
[42:38.88]But now I'll be living at the top of this cliff.
[42:42.00]When I'm ready to meet society again, I will be back.
[42:45.59]Thank you.
[42:45.91]Thank you for the wonderful home.
[42:47.69]I will not use it.
[42:49.59]There's a hole in the wall.
[42:57.24]There's nothing inside.
[42:58.38]Okay.
[43:01.80]What about this side?
[43:15.66]I love this character.
[43:17.72]This character right here.
[43:18.70]I want to recruit this person.
[43:20.38]Mr. Society left, didn't he?
[43:21.86]Hmm.
[43:23.02]I reckon I knew this would happen.
[43:25.84]It's not a no fault of yours.
[43:28.14]I'll be back one day.
[43:35.73]Without trees, I must gain nutrients by eating clothes.
[43:39.13]Such is the way of the worm.
[43:42.59]Looks like the clothes are nibbled.
[43:44.17]Take a bite.
[43:47.28]Yes.
[43:48.41]You put your mouth against the mannequin's cheek.
[43:52.03]Chris?
[43:53.73]Don't bother.
[43:54.29]It tastes awful.
[43:55.67]Aunt Susie did it too?
[44:04.12]I like being like this.
[44:05.72]Don't tell anybody.
[44:09.04]What's this?
[44:10.24]Seems to be locked.
[44:11.35]May never open again.
[44:12.35]Oh, this is... Okay.
[44:12.95]I know what that is.
[44:19.32]That's my favorite character.
[44:27.20]Alright, I explored the town a little bit.
[44:29.36]Let's save it.
[44:31.20]Let's go continue on a dragged out playthrough of Deltarune Chapter 2.
[44:38.71]Look, I'm gonna screw up a few times.
[44:41.95]Whatever.
[44:42.81]I'll learn.
[44:43.23]We'll just get back into the swing of things here.
[44:44.83]Alright, here we go.
[44:45.33]Who's this?
[44:46.55]It's a bit scary moving to a new place, but as a ball, there's nothing to sphere except sphere itself.
[44:54.35]Did I miss the bakery?
[44:55.15]I thought I tried to go in the bakery.
[44:57.95]Can I go in there?
[45:03.03]Yeah, I'm gonna have to get very upset with chat here for a second.
[45:09.34]If I said that, if we just saw the ball character and I said, there's nothing to sphere, but sphere itself, half of you would want me to turn the stream off.
[45:17.55]That's not fair.
[45:21.59]Oh, I am Chef Lancer.
[45:23.39]Try my delicious hand-formed cookies.
[45:25.95]They're free for a price.
[45:28.93]What's the price?
[45:29.87]Zero dollars.
[45:32.34]I'll take a cookie.
[45:33.84]I now pronounce you cookie and wife.
[45:36.64]Lancer cookie was added to your items.
[45:40.28]Okay.
[45:43.12]Well, well.
[45:44.32]Welcome to Top Bakery.
[45:46.32]I am this bakery's smith, Malleus.
[45:49.34]I do not know what any of these strange tools are for.
[45:53.13]Using my skills, I can fuse items to create new ones.
[45:58.39]Fix us.
[46:02.93]E.D.
[46:03.67]Double Dark Burger.
[46:05.05]The DD... The Double Dark Bouncing Bunger Burger.
[46:10.94]Okay, this is two dark burgers to make a double D burger.
[46:14.38]Two Amber cards is a silver card.
[46:16.02]Alright, so I just gotta... Let's go.
[46:19.74]I'm ready.
[46:23.64]Fix us.
[46:24.68]Your body is a weapon too.
[46:25.94]You must take care of it from time to time.
[46:28.19]Ha-ha!
[46:29.07]Sorry, homie.
[46:30.41]Ha-ha!
[46:31.41]I can do it better.
[46:31.85]Ha-ha!
[46:33.83]Let's feel my technique!
[46:38.02]There you go.
[46:42.48]Somehow everyone's HP was restored.
[46:45.35]Well, well, don't you feel better after a nice massage?
[46:47.71]Ha-ha!
[46:50.43]That hurts.
[46:50.95]I'm not doing it again.
[46:54.02]Lancer cookies, want one?
[46:56.46]Already tookie a cookie.
[46:58.34]Wait, I'm still regenerating from the last one.
[47:01.24]I don't know why he's talking like that, but that's what I've decided he was going to talk like.
[47:04.50]Okay, let's go.
[47:13.71]You can't fix Jerma.
[47:17.67]Alright, so let's go.
[47:20.57]Prince Rousey.
[47:22.25]I will keep your hat erect until you need it.
[47:24.45]That's a cool character too.
[47:32.70]Just wanted to show off your huge house, huh?
[47:36.00]No, what I want to show you is upstairs.
[47:40.66]Oh, I nearly forgot.
[47:41.60]This is where I cook.
[47:43.72]I cook everything in a giant witch's pot.
[47:46.96]You're pronouncing Rousey wrong.
[47:49.30]What is it?
[47:50.58]Give me it phonetically in the chat.
[47:53.20]Rowsley?
[47:54.26]Rowsley?
[47:54.98]Rousey?
[47:55.74]Rousey?
[47:57.84]Rousey.
[48:02.96]Rousey.
[48:06.40]Of course, cauldron cooking is very convenient.
[48:09.38]Here, Chris, Susie, have a cake.
[48:15.52]Mmm, a little thick on the frosting.
[48:18.32]That was for sharing.
[48:21.61]Anyone was free to make an interception.
[48:27.78]That's true.
[48:31.50]Second floor, living quarters.
[48:32.50]Okay, well, let's not do that yet.
[48:34.84]Door's locked, okay?
[48:35.78]What over here was this?
[48:38.50]Bottom floor, living quarters for bad guys.
[48:41.79]Wait.
[48:44.99]It's violently protecting the jail.
[48:49.35]We're still behind bars for some reason, but it's okay.
[48:52.67]We've grown to love this hellish place where we dress as animals.
[49:00.98]We decided to dress as Kings it's cultural exchange.
[49:15.66]And they're not even big, crazy burps either.
[49:18.64]That's the most embarrassing.
[49:19.34]You know how many times I've actually squelched those and you haven't heard them at all?
[49:24.21]If they were like... People would be like, holy shit, bro!
[49:30.17]But they're like little mouse burps.
[49:31.91]Like... Oh, hold on.
[49:40.58]Ah, the lightnings.
[49:43.40]Have you come to humiliate me?
[49:46.60]No.
[49:48.57]Mr. King, the Lightners returned everyone here safely.
[49:52.55]If you're willing to reconsider, then... I live in a kingdom ruled by you?
[49:57.63]The Lightner's little patsy?
[50:01.40]Staying in this cell is far less humiliating.
[50:05.26]Now, if you'll excuse me, a giant hamster wheel is getting cold.
[50:14.73]By the way,
[50:16.59]Is my son happy?
[50:19.87]Like you care.
[50:21.20]You were going to throw him off a cliff.
[50:22.62]Aye, your prejudice made my bluff too effective, I see.
[50:28.48]Besides, even if I threw him, he would just bounce.
[50:32.71]My son is a bouncy little pumpkin.
[50:37.71]Aw, cute.
[50:45.35]We have nothing to discuss.
[50:53.77]Alright, go upstairs and what I want to show you is up here.
[51:02.89]I have a surprise for you two.
[51:04.97]I made rooms for you in the castle.
[51:07.78]Rooms?
[51:09.72]So you can stay here whenever you want.
[51:12.17]I'd be happy if this place could be like a second home to you.
[51:15.03]A place that you can go no matter what's happening outside.
[51:20.49]Well, we'll take a look.
[51:23.55]Please tell me I get the Rocco's modern life door.
[51:26.09]That better be my room.
[51:32.05]Susie, this is your room.
[51:33.17]Okay.
[51:37.07]I tried to make it something you'd like.
[51:39.70]But you can put anything else you want in here, too.
[51:42.76]I really hope you like it.
[51:50.71]My own room, huh?
[51:51.49]I guess that's pretty cool.
[51:55.57]My own room, like this.
[51:56.69]How long did it take you to do all this?
[52:03.03]Well, since I last saw you two, I, um...
[52:06.57]Ow!
[52:06.75]You pushed me in my mouth!
[52:08.76]You pushed me in my mouth, I'm bleeding!
[52:10.82]Hey, you're a real weenie, you know that?
[52:14.64]I think she likes it, Chris.
[52:18.84]Uh, jealous I got the cool room?
[52:20.56]Look, Chris.
[52:24.15]What does my room look like?
[52:27.97]Cool spike bed.
[52:29.29]Now I can stab myself during the night.
[52:31.69]Finally some convenience.
[52:35.58]Damn, there's everything in here.
[52:37.44]Iron cones, chalk, moss, jars of salsa, pieces of ice, black crumbs from the toaster, jawbreakers.
[52:46.52]Oh, and like actual food, too.
[52:51.01]The clothes draw full of spiky and dangerous clothing.
[52:54.11]All the clothes are ripping each other up into shreds.
[52:57.27]Hell yeah.
[52:58.19]Jealous Chris?
[53:02.75]Susie, you didn't get to read the manual, so I put it over here for you.
[53:06.59]Cool.
[53:06.97]I'll read it before bed.
[53:07.75]That'll put me to sleep.
[53:10.49]Let's go!
[53:10.77]I want to see my room.
[53:17.08]It's your bed.
[53:18.24]Feels incredibly soft, like sleeping on a dream.
[53:21.36]It's a stand for your manual.
[53:23.64]I thought you might want to keep it here in case you want to read it.
[53:27.87]Is that a manual?
[53:28.65]Okay.
[53:30.61]Okay.
[53:32.56]It's a shelf.
[53:33.72]All sorts of keepsakes could be... But there might be hidden items here.
[53:37.00]It's a wardrobe full of all sorts of different clothes.
[53:38.80]You can wear whatever you want.
[53:42.16]Nice.
[53:43.31]I think that deserves a coffee chug.
[53:53.75]Pool.
[53:56.91]Is this Lancer's room?
[53:59.50]Lancer, you aren't gonna believe how sick my room is.
[54:03.08]room as sick as yours.
[54:04.08]Well, I want to see.
[54:05.90]I'll keep digging holes until I reach your room.
[54:09.64]It's got a door, you know, door Wow, peach boy, you went all out.
[54:16.75]Wow, it's better than I remember.
[54:19.47]I even have my own bed now.
[54:22.41]I don't have to sleep in a hole anymore.
[54:25.87]I thought you already had a bed.
[54:28.30]No, that was for the bike.
[54:32.01]Whole made recreationally.
[54:35.37]This is goofy.
[54:36.11]Change his voice.
[54:37.22]No more goofy.
[54:38.74]Don't do goofy anymore.
[54:40.84]I have to change?
[54:42.94]Is it not canonically in your head?
[54:44.76]It's not like a kind of low but goofy kind of voice?
[54:47.54]We hate this voice?
[54:51.11]It's bad?
[54:53.21]It's terrible.
[54:55.75]Lancer is a child.
[54:58.17]Oh, right.
[54:58.73]Okay.
[54:59.81]Let me see what I can do.
[55:03.11]I love that my floor is full of holes.
[55:07.21]Better?
[55:07.87]Hey, Ralsei, what's up here?
[55:16.33]Oh, just more rooms I'm renovating.
[55:18.76]So is your room up there?
[55:19.64]Uh, yes.
[55:22.22]I still haven't dusted it though.
[55:24.80]Yeah, like we need to see your nerdy glasses collection anyway.
[55:31.16]Oh, didn't you say what you wanted to show me was upstairs?
[55:33.80]Sorry, work in progress.
[55:36.16]What?
[55:36.30]I thought that was, I want to show you something upstairs.
[55:39.74]Oh, is that, that's what you want to do?
[55:40.98]Okay.
[55:42.95]Feel free to explore the town until you're ready to leave.
[55:46.33]We're going to leave now, right, Chris?
[55:49.65]You are upstairs.
[55:50.65]Oh, you wanted to show me the rooms.
[55:51.93]Imagine how rude that would be.
[55:54.89]Oh, I want to show you guys something upstairs.
[55:56.91]Okay, cool.
[55:58.82]So here are your rooms.
[56:00.22]This is your room.
[56:00.82]I spent like two months doing all this shit.
[56:03.70]I hired the construction team.
[56:05.24]You all of you are on separate rooms.
[56:06.72]Oh, yeah.
[56:07.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:08.26]Yep.
[56:09.70]So what did you want to show us up here?
[56:11.40]That's fucking so rude.
[56:15.83]The fucking cool rooms I made, all three of you?
[56:19.23]Yeah, right.
[56:20.55]It was cool.
[56:21.01]I don't know why I thought it was going to be an item or something.
[56:26.07]I don't know.
[56:32.55]Alright, I think I've explored enough.
[56:33.58]I get the gist of what's going on here.
[56:39.44]It's time to leave.
[56:43.82]Wait, Chris, we're leaving?
[56:44.84]But we just got here.
[56:46.89]Man, I don't want to go do our group project.
[56:50.35]Oh, you two have homework?
[56:53.75]Ah, well.
[56:56.03]Susie.
[56:57.74]Chris.
[56:58.99]You'll have to do it right away.
[57:00.49]School's important.
[57:02.13]I banish you from this kingdom until you start your project.
[57:06.13]Fine, I'll do it, geez.
[57:10.72]Susie, don't worry.
[57:12.32]I'll go and help you too.
[57:13.30]You know what, Lancer?
[57:16.58]Perhaps you shouldn't.
[57:17.36]Oops, wrong voice.
[57:19.98]Too late, kind boy.
[57:21.62]Friendship form.
[57:27.06]Lancer was added to your key items.
[57:31.48]Where'd you go?
[57:32.00]Don't worry.
[57:34.43]I just entered your inventory.
[57:36.49]I'll just be hanging out in Chris's pocket.
[57:39.81]I don't know what that means, but okay.
[57:43.61]Fear not.
[57:44.22]I too shall assist.
[57:46.62]Uh, we're good.
[57:48.34]Ah, quite.
[57:49.50]We as a team are good.
[57:53.26]Roxels became a key item, even though no one wanted that.
[57:59.89]Oh, alright.
[58:00.65]Enough already.
[58:01.21]Let's get going.
[58:05.35]Good luck today, Chris.
[58:06.67]See you soon.
[58:08.46]See you soon.
[58:17.70]Well, damn.
[58:18.12]Guess we gotta do our project.
[58:21.42]Sigh.
[58:23.06]At least we got Lancer, right?
[58:28.25]Lancer, where are you?
[58:30.40]He skipped out after all, huh?
[58:33.06]Hmm.
[58:35.68]Where should we do this?
[58:38.46]The library?
[58:40.04]Oh, well, alright.
[58:45.68]So when we go to the dark world, right?
[58:49.60]That's the only place they're allowed to exist.
[58:54.19]They don't exist here in the other world.
[58:56.13]Okay.
[58:59.45]Okay.
[59:01.20]Maybe they do?
[59:08.15]All of junk and cards.
[59:10.69]Okay, I don't have anything.
[59:11.59]Stat?
[59:12.15]Oh, no.
[59:12.61]I don't have anything.
[59:14.93]Okay, interesting.
[59:20.77]We're gonna go to the library.
[59:22.96]But not quite yet.
[59:23.92]The locker is locked.
[59:25.30]The locker is locked.
[59:26.88]The lock's locker is locked.
[59:28.86]The locker's lock's locker is locked.
[59:33.97]Computer wallpaper is updated.
[59:36.13]The buff Embracing Heroes are now edited to be four inches apart.
[59:40.35]There's dialog about proper distancing at the school dance.
[59:43.87]You wonder if your mother had some influence on this change.
[59:48.84]It's a bunch of roses.
[59:53.70]Looks like motivational quotes from various literature.
[59:56.52]Try your best, Astral Wolf, even in your darkest hour.
[60:00.72]That one seems to be from a video game.
[60:14.77]He ran the water fountain.
[60:16.17]It's lukewarm.
[60:18.86]Locker, it's locked.
[60:19.82]Oh, I'm aware of this.
[60:20.94]This used to be your brother's locker.
[60:23.72]This used to be your brother's locker.
[60:26.28]Locker, it's locked.
[60:27.02]Okay.
[60:28.96]Oh, wait a minute.
[60:29.38]What's all this?
[60:33.39]Ms.
[60:33.69]Toriel is written in cursive on the dry erase board.
[60:36.77]Seems like it hasn't been erased in a very long time.
[60:42.45]You uncapped the scented green marker.
[60:44.67]It's almost dry, but that gives it a refined, aged apple bouquet.
[60:48.10]The poster has several basic shapes.
[60:56.56]Circle, oval, square.
[60:59.80]It's a book.
[61:05.67]Some of them used to be yours.
[61:09.47]Marker sniffer.
[61:11.35]It's an orange.
[61:11.85]It's unknown if it's safe for teachers to eat this.
[61:16.63]Throne of the gods grows higher.
[61:18.73]Is this hubris?
[61:24.86]Okay, cool.
[61:25.40]What's on the computer?
[61:26.86]Computer wallpaper is updated.
[61:27.94]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[61:29.84]Do it again, do it again.
[61:30.34]I missed it.
[61:32.64]Picture of your brother and you playing video games.
[61:35.28]Your brother is using the knockoff controller.
[61:37.78]Yep.
[61:39.31]Yep, that was me.
[61:42.43]But here's the one thing about that knockoff controller that us little brothers in the chat will remember.
[61:48.50]Some of those had a turbo feature.
[61:51.72]And yeah, being able to shoot whatever the weapon I was shooting at 5 million miles a second while my brother was kind of annoyed by it turned out okay to me.
[62:01.31]Turn the turbo on hold X. Turn the turbo on hold Y.
[62:11.59]It was a little switch on the front or back of the controller.
[62:18.35]Wait, hold on.
[62:20.45]Are you ready for the Sadie Hawkman's dance?
[62:24.82]At this dance, all the chaperones wear giant hawk heads and screech at any students that make contact while dancing.
[62:38.73]Okay, let's go!
[62:40.73]I check everything, I know.
[62:41.75]This is how I play RPGs.
[62:46.60]There's so much to see.
[62:52.08]Is it band practice?
[62:57.36]This is what it sounds like right before a band starts to play.
[63:08.33]Oh.
[63:12.18]Well, okay.
[63:16.64]Damn, I was just directing traffic as normal.
[63:21.21]When a little dog drove one of these toy cars into the middle of the street and started doing donuts.
[63:27.39]In the chaos, all the cars in town got jammed up.
[63:33.53]Thankfully, no one was hurt, but ordinary citizens like you gotta get out of here.
[63:38.52]some heavy lifting to do every time I see that face I have to do a different I have to get a little weird don't interrupt me when I'm lifting I heard a dog was doing donuts so I sped over here but I just learned donuts is actually the name of a special attack for cars is my life stuck in a loop of doughy disappointment
[64:06.43]Traffic's moving at a snail's pace.
[64:08.63]I love snails.
[64:09.81]Could today get any better?
[64:10.75]Looks like a car.
[64:16.94]Looks like a car.
[64:17.70]Well, I can't go anywhere.
[64:25.03]Alright, we're here.
[64:27.05]School.
[64:27.81]Goddamn project.
[64:31.81]Looks goddamn crazy about them.
[64:37.66]Hey, Chris.
[64:38.26]Where the hell is everybody?
[64:42.69]Something seems kind of off.
[64:46.79]Screw it.
[64:47.07]Let's just go play space pinball in the computer lab.
[64:54.33]Wait, it's another one of these?
[64:55.96]Huh?
[64:58.44]It's like... the inside of the closet.
[65:03.32]Chris, you don't think this could be...
[65:07.10]Hmm.
[65:08.32]Another dark world.
[65:13.02]Well, I guess this means we can't start our project.
[65:17.65]Unless, you know, Chris, if there's a dark fountain in there, you can seal it.
[65:23.89]It'll turn back into the computer lab, right?
[65:27.43]So what's it gonna be, Chris?
[65:30.80]Let's go, let's go!
[65:31.84]We can just use the computer in my house.
[65:34.10]Ha ha ha!
[65:41.20]I mean, this one's the, that's the boring answer.
[65:45.90]Let's go.
[65:46.66]Let's, do I have to say it?
[65:48.30]Do I have to say it the way, like, loud?
[65:50.60]Okay, loud, do you want me to say it like 12-year-old Xbox Live loud?
[65:57.34]Or 36-year-old man loud?
[65:59.32]Which one?
[66:07.56]Oh, okay.
[66:09.08]12, 12, I'm seeing a logite.
[66:12.53]Alright!
[66:13.63]Let's go!
[66:18.27]Yeah, let's just drop the act.
[66:20.29]Our last adventure was great, right?
[66:26.68]I couldn't stop thinking about having another.
[66:31.21]I don't know what's in there, but can't live if we don't find out, right?
[66:37.81]Come on, Chris.
[66:45.73]So is this going to be the same place or is it going to be like a different multiverse or something?
[66:50.57]I wonder.
[66:50.87]This is new.
[66:57.91]This is new.
[66:59.92]So what the heck's going on here?
[67:09.46]Oh, shit.
[67:10.96]Wait, inspect.
[67:12.60]Inspect that.
[67:13.00]Oh.
[67:21.00]What's this?
[67:25.53]The wires.
[67:26.71]The wires.
[67:29.71]You alright?
[67:38.14]Hey.
[67:40.62]Alright.
[67:41.38]I get it.
[67:41.68]I can plug anything in?
[67:45.43]Oh shit.
[67:48.45]Ow.
[67:50.55]Oh, there they are again.
[67:59.88]Everyone was...
[68:10.35]Everyone else has been... Save us.
[68:14.56]She's going to... Somebody help me!
[68:23.73]Somebody, please!
[68:25.91]Susie?
[68:27.59]Cool that you're here, just... Get out of here before it's too late!
[68:48.88]Hell of a study session!
[68:51.19]Who the hell are you?
[68:55.77]I am known as serial number Q5U4EX7YY2E9N.
[68:57.67]What you foolish children may call me... Queen.
[69:10.07]Like you're going to call you queen?
[69:13.37]You five, three, I don't know.
[69:17.45]Queen.
[69:19.83]Well, look, queen, we're not children.
[69:23.15]Teens are merely big children and adults are even bigger children.
[69:29.66]Doesn't that make you a child too then?
[69:32.84]No, I am a computer, smart.
[69:38.66]Well, thank you for the stimuli, but I must leave now.
[69:41.02]Goodbye.
[69:41.52]Hey, where are you going?
[69:44.94]Why'd you capture Noelle?
[69:47.32]Oh, I would have captured you too, but I ran out of cages.
[69:52.48]Why the capturing?
[69:54.74]So that she may become my willing peon in my quest for world domination.
[70:01.43]Also, maybe I will make her face into a robot one.
[70:04.27]Who knows?
[70:04.87]I could.
[70:05.17]Wait, why?
[70:08.40]Same school.
[70:11.18]Oh, forget it, dude.
[70:13.28]Nobody's turning anyone's face into a robot.
[70:16.68]Could that be a statement of animus dissension?
[70:21.52]Huh?
[70:23.00]You want to fight, loser?
[70:25.78]Yes, yes already, yes.
[70:29.18]Oh, then bye.
[70:31.24]Wait, what?
[70:31.84]Wait a second.
[70:33.30]I have no time for such rivuleties and would kick your ass in a second.
[70:38.95]Perhaps someone else could entertain you.
[70:47.26]Enjoy your assimilation.
[70:52.10]Where wires swung in?
[70:53.50]Okay, they're tired.
[70:57.44]They're already tired.
[70:59.06]So... Can I do row wire?
[71:04.66]Jiggle, jiggle.
[71:05.46]Can I try to pull the wire off the head?
[71:08.29]Throw what?
[71:08.85]Toss Chris to free wire.
[71:10.21]Yeah.
[71:12.91]What the fuck?
[71:13.57]Press Y to throw an aim for the weak point.
[71:17.68]Oh, I can get them both.
[71:19.12]The wire greatly loosened.
[71:20.08]Okay, cool.
[71:22.30]That's 50%.
[71:22.52]Alright, almost there.
[71:30.70]Oh, I was going to say, don't act like I don't know what to do.
[71:32.96]Alright, let's do that again.
[71:36.74]Okay, uh, throw wire.
[71:37.86]Let's try this again.
[71:40.00]Got it.
[71:43.82]So, are they ready?
[71:44.32]That's 50%, right?
[71:45.46]Fuck.
[71:45.64]Alright, spare.
[71:58.92]You're ready to go.
[72:01.90]And can we spare them both?
[72:03.09]Probably not, no.
[72:06.41]No, we can only spare them just one.
[72:09.04]Spare the werewire.
[72:09.80]Recruit.
[72:10.38]Oh, I recruit.
[72:10.94]Right, right, right.
[72:11.42]Susie spared werewire, but its name wasn't yellow.
[72:14.64]Try using X. Oh, shit.
[72:26.84]Yeah, god gamer alert.
[72:29.26]By the way, I have to really make this really, really, really important note to everybody here.
[72:33.09]I'm bad at a lot of things.
[72:34.75]Very bad.
[72:36.71]You put me in, like, Call of Duty, whatever, I'm gonna get, like, fucking 0 and 20 during the game, right?
[72:40.93]Sometimes I get lost.
[72:41.61]I don't know east from west.
[72:43.47]But you watch this shit, and after this fucking stream, I want to hear you talk about what I can and cannot do.
[72:49.32]Okay?
[72:50.30]Good.
[72:51.46]I want to hear what you think I can and cannot do after this.
[72:56.83]Well, after this part.
[73:08.85]He can't reach the cookie jar?
[73:10.37]I fucking banned that guy.
[73:12.85]What are you talking about?
[73:15.79]Oh my god.
[73:16.37]Alright, that was... I'm fine.
[73:19.94]I'm just not gonna hit.
[73:26.31]Alright, act, let's go.
[73:29.97]Oh my god.
[73:30.69]I just, okay.
[73:33.47]I'm not throwing, I'm not tilted.
[73:35.46]I just, it's weird, it's different.
[73:38.30]Okay, now I'm fucked up.
[73:39.28]Now you got me fucked up.
[73:40.70]You got me fucked up, you do.
[73:44.98]This is why you never call a home run.
[73:47.11]I don't know how people did that shit.
[73:49.33]Like, when Babe Ruth used to, like, get his ass up to the plate and, like, hold the bat up, it's just like, holy shit, dude, what if you just strike out right now?
[73:55.57]You're gonna look like a dickhead.
[74:02.84]I'll get it right now.
[74:07.02]Imagine calling a home run and the pitcher, like, just strikes you out in three pitches.
[74:12.60]That probably happened all the time.
[74:14.07]There was no television to see that.
[74:20.17]How come people don't do that anymore?
[74:21.26]Don't you think that'd be funny?
[74:27.10]It would be all over SportsCenter.
[74:29.92]Alright, I'm not gonna stop fucking around.
[74:31.52]Spare.
[74:39.61]You won.
[74:39.95]You got 188 D dollars.
[74:42.67]Nice fighting again after so long.
[74:46.24]Now let's go catch up to the queen.
[74:50.86]Or not.
[74:53.40]Wait, they calmed down.
[74:54.10]I just used my pacify spell to put them into sleep mode.
[75:00.46]Rousey, you're here?
[75:01.90]I felt a dark presence and hurried over.
[75:06.73]It seems that a new dark fountain has appeared.
[75:10.23]Rousey, they got Noelle.
[75:12.35]Damn, what was she thinking, messing in our dark world?
[75:14.55]If we don't do something, she might be...
[75:18.46]Hurry not, Susie.
[75:20.08]All we have to do is seal the fountain.
[75:24.52]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[75:26.00]Can't be mad about another adventure, right?
[75:29.13]Come on, Chris.
[75:33.23]What's this?
[75:48.02]What's going on?
[75:48.38]Do I have to touch those?
[75:49.38]Touch them?
[75:50.60]I thought it was like a Guitar Hero game.
[75:52.10]Whatever.
[75:52.86]What do I do?
[75:59.34]Am I doing this right?
[76:13.82]A green field extends before you, and in the distance, a city shines brightly.
[76:17.48]You're filled with the power of a new adventure.
[76:25.79]Very cool.
[76:27.63]Very cool.
[76:29.27]Cyber World.
[76:30.11]Turn it up.
[76:36.99]It's already pretty loud, isn't it?
[76:44.32]How's that?
[76:51.77]I'll turn up the music stuff.
[76:58.53]Very cool.
[76:59.01]Alright, nice.
[77:01.11]Whoa, okay.
[77:03.89]Where are wires swung in?
[77:04.69]Okay, so now we have... Can Rousey do anything?
[77:13.13]Rousey has magic.
[77:14.55]Pacify, right?
[77:16.35]Spare a tired foe.
[77:17.47]Alright.
[77:17.71]Are they already tired?
[77:19.81]They already are tired, aren't they?
[77:20.98]I believe they are.
[77:24.18]But, whatever.
[77:24.72]We're gonna go for it.
[77:25.58]Just defend.
[77:28.64]Shit.
[77:42.90]Alright.
[77:44.26]Same deal.
[77:48.66]And then you, uh, we're going to pacify you.
[77:59.34]Shit.
[77:59.61]Sorry.
[78:02.93]Rousey cast pacify.
[78:04.17]Just one.
[78:07.57]That's fine.
[78:08.21]Easy.
[78:17.68]Can I pacify?
[78:19.90]What is it?
[78:20.73]How much PP is it?
[78:22.01]16.
[78:22.41]Yeah, whatever.
[78:23.43]We're good.
[78:26.57]Pacify.
[78:29.35]Jiggle the wire.
[78:29.99]But I like doing the aim down sights.
[78:34.66]Ooh!
[78:35.22]Treasure chest!
[78:36.48]You opened the treasure chest.
[78:37.68]Inside was a glow wrist.
[78:39.50]Glow wrist was added to your armor.
[78:40.68]Ooh.
[78:40.76]Ooh.
[78:47.25]Who's it for?
[78:49.75]Cuteness.
[78:52.35]Amber card.
[78:53.53]Thin square charm that sticks to you and increases defense.
[78:56.10]What about, what's it?
[78:56.70]Oh, Glowrist.
[78:57.26]Who should have the defense?
[78:58.30]Probably Chris.
[78:58.78]Everyone else just has that.
[79:02.04]Oh, wait.
[79:02.28]White Ribbon.
[79:03.32]A crinkly hair ribbon that slightly increases your defense.
[79:05.44]Is Amber card better?
[79:06.34]No.
[79:10.09]That is so behind compared to the stream.
[79:12.07]Refresh.
[79:12.55]Really?
[79:12.91]Really?
[79:19.14]Alright, I don't want to miss anything.
[79:24.76]Does that.
[79:25.18]Let's go this way.
[79:25.94]I'm going to go all the way to... Oh, what's that?
[79:33.94]Queen rules.
[79:38.30]Wait.
[79:38.44]Yep.
[79:43.46]Cat's living five minutes in the past.
[79:47.18]Whoa, alright.
[79:47.88]Well, now what?
[79:49.68]What do I have to do?
[79:50.24]I have to match the... Oh, hold on.
[79:54.77]I don't know.
[79:55.09]I don't get it.
[79:55.47]Oh, yeah, I do.
[79:56.95]Okay.
[79:57.15]I thought I had to collect them with different characters.
[80:03.33]Alright.
[80:03.61]Well, here we go.
[80:04.03]Here comes the good... You know what it is.
[80:12.00]Go!
[80:43.35]I get this, but I don't get it somehow at the same time.
[80:47.07]Certain characters have to touch them because they're different, they're different colored.
[80:58.50]Book.
[81:00.60]Oh, Chris, it's a free edible cyberpedia.
[81:05.17]I'll add an entry.
[81:07.09]Rousey wrote an article about losing recruits.
[81:09.61]Would you like to read it?
[81:10.39]Sure.
[81:13.05]From now on, defeating enemies with violence will make them lost.
[81:17.43]Lost enemies can't become recruits ever again.
[81:20.95]But the bonds you break may make you stronger.
[81:23.18]Alright, so if you kill people, they're gone.
[81:27.38]I'm gonna try to spare as many people as I can.
[81:34.84]Lightners, I haven't seen many of you recently.
[81:37.66]If you didn't know, an evil ruler is taking over this world.
[81:42.48]I don't really like politics, so I have no opinion on this.
[81:47.21]If you try to... Oh, I said something.
[81:49.63]I missed that.
[81:50.49]We will have no choice but to cross swords.
[81:52.51]I'm going to say it again.
[81:57.53]If you try to talk to me about politics, we will have no choice but to cross swords.
[82:05.75]Oh shit!
[82:08.87]Taskies crossed your path.
[82:11.08]Alright, what do we got?
[82:15.36]Uh... Check petting soft voice or roar.
[82:22.21]Check.
[82:25.09]Check.
[82:27.15]And... Rude Buster.
[82:29.21]No, check and defend.
[82:32.06]I don't want to swing the sword.
[82:32.90]Okay, here we go.
[82:36.42]Umm... Assify, I can't do that.
[82:39.04]Eel prayer.
[82:39.50]Alright, we're gonna defend.
[82:41.60]This stray cat is in need of some management.
[82:45.29]Meow, meow, meow!
[82:46.07]Okay, so it needs management.
[82:54.05]So how about, um... Soft voice?
[82:58.90]Roar?
[82:59.18]Alright, we're gonna roar.
[83:04.03]Uzi roared.
[83:04.85]The enemies became tired.
[83:06.25]Oh, shit.
[83:06.69]Here we go.
[83:08.50]Who's king of the jungle now?
[83:10.68]It's just a cat.
[83:12.08]Meow, meow, meow.
[83:12.74]Alright, let's, uh... We can't spare, but we can act.
[83:23.01]Let's do another roar.
[83:24.13]I thought it said burping.
[83:27.79]Alright, pacify.
[83:31.40]As he roared, the enemies became tired again.
[83:33.06]Rousey cast pacify.
[83:34.20]Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
[83:45.25]Tired.
[83:46.07]Um, maybe I should pet.
[83:47.83]Alright, what if I pet?
[83:53.93]You pet task.
[83:55.15]It liked that.
[83:57.05]And then pacify.
[83:57.81]Okay.
[84:00.33]He won.
[84:01.87]We didn't have to hurt anything.
[84:02.65]I gotta check up here.
[84:09.74]Leave no stone untouched.
[84:14.62]Recently, something called internet is having an outage.
[84:18.84]Some say it was the secret to Queen's know-how.
[84:22.42]Since then, it seems like she's become quite extreme.
[84:32.26]Unturned, not untouched.
[84:37.24]Whatever.
[84:38.86]Noelle, honey, become my willing peon and I will free you.
[84:42.61]All you have to do is hit yes on the peon release form.
[84:48.69]Scared.
[84:50.25]Oh, have you never signed a form before?
[84:52.15]No, it's everything else that's scary.
[84:56.49]Please abort your sadness protocol.
[84:59.06]I told you being a peon will be cool.
[85:03.87]Noelle!
[85:06.11]Susie?
[85:07.01]Chris?
[85:08.77]Don't worry, we won't let your face get roboticized.
[85:12.67]That's something they're gonna do?
[85:13.95]Oh whoops, I thought you knew that.
[85:17.03]Oh dear, that was supposed to be a surprise.
[85:20.33]Oh well.
[85:24.43]Wait.
[85:26.55]It is quite troubling.
[85:28.53]A peon must be willing to assist me in world domination.
[85:32.76]If only she had fellow peons to encourage her.
[85:38.20]So?
[85:40.62]So, like, you guys.
[85:43.35]Hey, are you, like, doing anything right now?
[85:47.39]We aren't going to help you.
[85:51.78]Understood.
[85:52.68]Mind-changing protocol necessitated.
[86:07.77]Giant arcade game I Shall humiliate you at a simple children's diversion with your self-esteem eradicated There will be no choice, but to serve me The hell and I've played this one before Chris it's quite good at games Chris is quite good at games aren't they oops
[86:33.42]Oh yeah, Chris.
[86:34.54]Forgot you were a nerd.
[86:36.02]Show her.
[86:36.44]Oh fuck, I'm not ready.
[86:46.38]It's hard to perform in front of people when you're not ready.
[86:51.10]Oh Chris, congratulations on losing horribly.
[86:53.24]I advanced my internal clock to when I've already won.
[86:56.44]Also, happy birthday, Susie.
[86:59.08]Happy birthday!
[87:00.91]It's not my birthday.
[87:06.25]Okay.
[87:07.17]You tried to use the arcade machine.
[87:09.33]You weren't tall or strong enough to use the controls.
[87:14.45]That's why.
[87:16.07]Self-esteem eradication complete.
[87:18.69]Running laughing protocol.
[87:25.58]It's okay, Chris.
[87:26.94]I'm short, too.
[87:29.98]Chris, wait.
[87:31.30]I have an idea.

[88:21.52]Commence virtual combat.
[88:24.19]Wait, we're gonna play, like, Street Fighter?
[88:27.45]Round one.

[88:29.47]What the hell?
[88:30.03]Press A or B if you dare.
[88:31.41]Shut up.
[88:35.24]Let's punch out.
[88:35.74]I'm so good at punch out.
[88:36.50]You have no idea.
[88:37.90]Should I let him win?
[88:42.46]Should I let... Is this pacifist if I do it in a video game?
[89:06.29]Oh, a duck.
[89:11.31]Oh shit, I don't have to do it more than once.
[89:22.05]I'm so good at Punch-Out, you have no idea.
[89:31.25]Yeah, thought you could beat us.
[89:38.27]Oh my, that was actually quite amusing.
[89:39.81]New lifeforms have exceeded my expectations.
[89:44.51]I will offer you a new, exceedingly benevolent compromise.
[89:48.94]Assimilate into my cyber army, and there is only a 50% chance I will reprogram your face.
[89:55.18]Please select your choice.
[89:56.80]Perish in the chill of absolute destruction, or flourish under the warm bosom of my hellish reign.
[90:07.27]Wait, we can be, just join the bad guys?
[90:10.35]What do I do?
[90:11.53]Isn't, but isn't perish fight?
[90:12.73]I wonder if it's, should I just do this?
[90:16.31]I think this is, oh, let's fight.
[90:18.05]I, let's, I don't want to fight.
[90:19.07]Let's go for it.
[90:24.00]Uh, it means titty.
[90:27.92]We know what it means.
[90:29.06]We aren't helping you.
[90:31.08]Understood.
[90:31.68]Preference setting set to perish.
[90:37.69]Come on, let's go after her.
[90:42.92]The game is wrecked.
[90:44.14]You're filled with the power of video game violence.
[90:59.69]I want to go back to the city, but the way is blocked.
[91:03.29]I'm no country boy.
[91:04.49]Let me out of cyber field.
[91:08.66]I heard there's a rebel team resisting Queen.
[91:11.88]So far, all I found are overpriced bagels.
[91:20.18]Yo, Snicker, it's hard work being Queen's minion, ain't it?
[91:26.52]Why don't you take a break and grab a snack?
[91:30.04]Grab a Snickers!
[91:32.67]Can I- I gotta talk about this really quickly.
[91:35.69]Um... So you know, like, Snickers, right?
[91:38.17]It's like, oh, yeah, is he hungry?
[91:40.04]Yeah, you need a Snickers.
[91:40.90]I can't remember the last time I got hungry and wanted to eat a fucking candy bar.
[91:45.62]Why do they do that ad campaign?
[91:46.70]I don't understand.
[91:48.46]Old material?
[91:49.12]Don't care.
[91:51.58]You've said this before?
[91:52.26]I don't care.
[91:54.64]If I don't get hungry and wanna- Oh, you know what?
[91:57.15]Let me go to a convenience store and get- Go to the candy aisle.
[92:00.97]And who carries around a king-sized Snickers in their purse or pocket or something?
[92:05.19]Nobody does that.
[92:07.41]I'm not going to eat that.
[92:13.19]Do you carry around a full bar of Snickers in your pocket?
[92:18.19]They always seem to have one on them.
[92:21.62]Oh, thank God somebody had a full king-sized Snickers in their pocket.
[92:26.70]What?
[92:29.76]Why don't you take a break and grab a snack?
[92:33.52]Ultra seedy, seedy bagels, only $400 each.
[92:39.38]It's the peanuts.
[92:41.60]Why don't you eat peanuts then?
[92:44.20]Peanuts are easier to carry.
[92:46.33]They can fit in a little bag.
[92:47.35]They're dry.
[92:47.99]You just eat peanuts.
[92:51.95]You don't need to eat the chocolate nougat and whatever junk they put in there.
[92:59.02]I have trail mix in your pocket.
[93:00.22]Why would you eat a Snickers when you're hungry?
[93:05.92]Alright, uh, how much money?
[93:07.62]500?
[93:07.82]Should I buy one of these?
[93:08.68]It's a bagel?
[93:20.54]I'm gonna buy it.
[93:21.82]Pleasure doing business with you.
[93:25.14]Have a Snickers.
[93:27.31]CD bagel was added to your items.
[93:34.13]Wanna buy a bagel?
[93:34.87]Only $80.
[93:35.45]Okay, no.
[93:37.61]It's 400.
[93:38.11]Got it.
[93:40.89]Wanna buy 400 bagels.
[93:42.47]Only $80.
[93:44.07]Oh, shit.
[93:46.52]Yes.
[93:49.70]You were crushed under the weight of 400 bagels and defeated instantly.
[93:53.10]Wait, what?
[93:57.92]Not really.
[93:58.70]You just can't carry that many.
[94:02.48]One bagel, $80.
[94:03.48]400 bagels, $80.
[94:04.30]I'll take one bagel, please.
[94:08.68]Can I have one, too?
[94:10.28]You're selling them!
[94:12.14]Oh, I got scammed.
[94:13.00]Whoops.
[94:20.23]What is it?
[94:20.77]What are they?
[94:22.69]Oh, shit.
[94:24.95]Bagel with a reflective inside makes music with each bite.
[94:27.89]Oh, god damn it.
[94:29.29]I did get scammed.
[94:33.29]Oh, that game looked fun.
[94:34.59]Let me be the stool next.
[94:36.01]He tried to call on the cell phone.
[94:43.55]I missed an area?
[94:44.49]Hold on.
[94:45.21]What the fuck was that?
[94:47.58]It's nothing but garbage noise.
[94:52.33]Cuisine is so unrefined out here in the sticks.
[94:56.59]I missed a room.
[95:02.44]Oh, shit.
[95:04.48]What's this guy?
[95:08.66]I can't tell you how many of these I've cleaned up.
[95:16.66]Not so bad.
[95:17.40]I like cleaning.
[95:25.04]Alright, so I missed a door?
[95:26.00]Where?
[95:26.24]I didn't miss anything.
[95:30.50]What's walking about?
[95:38.15]Oh, up this way.
[95:39.75]Okay.
[95:40.01]Apple.
[95:40.39]Chris, I think you should handle this puzzle.
[95:44.69]Apple.
[95:46.47]A. B. E. A. B. A. B.
[95:55.90]I want to say it so bad.
[96:00.01]I want to say it so bad.
[96:09.01]I had to do it.
[96:09.74]I'm sorry.
[96:10.34]What?
[96:10.82]That was like not even a bad meme.
[96:12.14]What are you talking about?
[96:12.82]It was funny.
[96:13.70]I liked it.
[96:14.34]What's wrong with it?
[96:16.67]Looks like you got past Newbert's force field.
[96:20.01]Newbert doesn't know how that force field got there.
[96:23.15]It's Newbert's force field.
[96:25.21]I'm surprised.
[96:26.01]Have Newbert's treasure.
[96:27.91]Newbert doesn't know what's inside.
[96:30.07]Newbert will give it to you.
[96:33.55]I love Newbert.
[96:37.79]You open the treasure chest.
[96:39.00]Inside was fiber scarf.
[96:40.70]Fiber scarf was added to your weapons.
[96:47.67]Fiber scarf.
[96:49.13]For... Uh... You.
[96:53.88]Okay.
[96:56.98]Ooh.
[96:57.50]A scarf made of soft microfiber balances attack and magic.
[97:00.22]That's pretty good.
[97:03.70]Pretty good.
[97:05.72]Anything else to say, Newbert?
[97:08.30]That's Newbert's treasure.
[97:10.16]Remember, you're just borrowing it.
[97:11.60]Forever.
[97:12.30]Forever.
[97:22.46]That's funny.
[97:24.50]I like that guy.
[97:25.10]Okay.
[97:25.60]Cool.
[97:26.76]What do you have to say?
[97:28.72]Recently, something called internet is happening.
[97:30.18]Oh, yeah.
[97:30.54]Oh, internet.
[97:30.90]By the way, so the queen's been using the internet too much and now she's gone crazy or something.
[97:53.70]The internet is down.
[97:55.44]Okay, so I'm gonna go down.
[97:58.90]Down or up?
[97:59.32]I'm going down first.
[98:00.00]She lost the internet.
[98:05.78]Can't go this way.
[98:06.30]It looks like I get dumped out this way.
[98:07.41]Okay, what about up?
[98:18.09]Is this a slide?
[98:21.42]I'm the hacker.
[98:22.48]I'm going after the blue checkmarks.
[98:26.99]Find three in the cyber field ahead, and I'll join your city.
[98:31.59]You just look like the kind of folks who have a cooler city.
[98:36.69]According to cyber, you found zero blue checkmarks out of three.
[98:41.40]Zero.
[98:42.38]Not bad for a beginner.
[98:44.00]Your checks quest is only beginning.
[98:49.29]Okay, we need to go to find three blue checkpoints.
[98:55.65]Like here?
[98:56.11]We'll go down from here.
[99:02.47]Stupid!
[99:05.25]Hey!
[99:05.49]Alright, we're good.
[99:12.41]Uh, they're- they're not tied yet.
[99:14.65]No.
[99:15.09]So we're gonna do soft voice.
[99:19.38]And you're going to defend.
[99:21.97]Rousey talked in a soft voice to the enemies.
[99:26.15]There, there.
[99:26.91]It's okay, little kitty.
[99:28.05]Did that work?
[99:31.18]Alright.
[99:34.96]Ask is ima-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a
[99:49.53]Spare.
[99:49.95]3 to 5.
[99:50.65]4 to 5.
[99:54.45]You won.
[99:58.69]I love this song.
[99:59.41]This song's great.
[100:02.37]Ooh.
[100:04.63]You opened the treasure chest.
[100:05.81]Inside was glow wrist.
[100:07.29]Glow wrist was added to your arm wrist.
[100:08.53]Nice.
[100:08.71]Alright, so who has?
[100:13.48]You have a glow wrist.
[100:14.18]You could have two glow wrists on.
[100:16.34]But we're going to give you one to everybody if we can.
[100:28.33]What's going on here?
[100:30.19]Seems to be stuck.
[100:32.15]Can I help?
[100:32.59]I don't think I can help.
[100:35.05]If you don't finish this today, you're going to finish it tomorrow.
[100:39.94]Yes.
[100:41.72]The plan was if this didn't take me too long, I was going to play the umbrella game.
[100:46.84]But if I'm just kind of pacing myself for the game, we'll do it tomorrow.
[100:51.77]This is blocked off.
[100:52.59]It appears to be some kind of force field.
[100:57.96]God.
[101:00.29]Virovicorun.

[101:26.55]I'm the chill.
[101:32.44]Okay.
[101:33.86]Sweating suspiciously.
[101:35.32]Alright, act.
[101:38.66]Take care X or take care?
[101:40.56]I will take care X. Everyone treated the enemy with tender loving care.
[101:44.50]All the enemies felt great.
[101:47.50]Kindness is contagious.
[101:54.84]Okay, it looks healthy.
[101:55.56]Is that it?
[101:57.74]It is.

[110:46.81]Oh, pretty.
[110:48.31]Beautiful.
[110:50.87]You got verified on Twitter.
[110:55.80]Very nice.
[110:56.92]I just wanted to make a cool demo scene for you.
[110:59.86]Now that I've finished this, I can show up all sorts of places.
[111:04.49]Okay.
[111:08.27]Very nice.
[111:10.77]Well, thanks.
[111:14.34]Alright, this one, this place I didn't go.
[111:16.44]I didn't go up here.
[111:17.12]I feel like I didn't go somewhere over here too.
[111:20.85]I did, okay.
[111:22.17]Oh, can I go up from there?
[111:33.05]It appears to be some kind of force field now.
[111:47.59]I don't want to fight you.
[111:51.87]Oh, wait.
[111:52.23]I got to go up from there.
[111:56.23]And then progression is the one on the left, right?
[111:57.95]No, the one on the right.
[112:00.19]Okay.
[112:10.20]Okay.
[112:20.90]I don't like that.
[112:22.34]He's gonna drop something on me.
[112:23.14]We're gonna get dropped cages on us.
[112:26.11]I told you.
[112:31.67]This is gonna be wild.
[112:38.84]You guys want a tip?
[112:40.32]Always stand in the middle.
[112:42.22]Whoops, I didn't do my own tip.
[112:50.64]There's more?
[112:51.16]This is bigger.
[112:52.26]Oh, shit.
[112:55.08]Dead end.
[112:58.39]Alright, what's the deal?
[112:59.45]Twerp.
[113:01.07]Who's a twerp?
[113:01.97]The name's Sweet.
[113:03.73]Oh, like sweet?
[113:05.07]Like sweets?
[113:07.55]Don't tell me you haven't heard of the Sweet Cap'n Cakes.
[113:12.53]Doesn't ring a bell.
[113:14.37]I guess our act's still a bit underground.
[113:16.90]Sweet Captain Cakes, not only are we Cyberfield's best musical trio, we're also the last resistance against a big bad queen and all her crew.
[113:24.72]That starts with zzzz-you.
[113:31.16]What?
[113:31.34]We're fighting the queen too.
[113:32.41]Nuh-uh-uh.
[113:34.61]Captain saw you help her kidnap some girl.
[113:37.79]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[113:39.03]Cap.
[113:41.27]We won't let anyone lay a finger on mademoiselles.
[113:45.59]except us.
[113:46.69]That's not the point, Captain.
[113:48.81]It's like half the point, 60%, 55%.
[113:50.29]We're rebels, not players.
[113:53.99]We're rebels that play.
[113:55.07]We don't play, we don't play.
[113:57.09]That's it.
[113:58.19]Okay?
[113:59.17]Get over here.
[114:00.35]Okay, I don't, who's this?
[114:03.58]Okay, okay, are we players?
[114:06.60]I'm a CD player.
[114:15.83]Wait, they're getting away.
[114:18.26]Sweet, chill.
[114:19.34]There'll be other bad guys.
[114:20.62]No, this is our chance.
[114:22.74]Are you ready?
[114:23.14]Let's fight.
[114:23.70]Okay.
[114:29.54]Yeah.
[114:30.87]Play some battle music.
[114:32.65]Okay.
[114:35.55]Sweet Cap'n Cakes walks your way.
[114:40.53]Okay, not dancing.
[114:43.85]Sweet, KK, and Cap'n.
[114:47.85]Not currently dancing.
[114:50.43]I'm gonna have to say, let's go with Sweet.
[114:51.89]Let's do a check.
[114:52.61]Maybe just start dancing.
[114:54.83]Alright, let's do Dance X. Everyone danced with Sweet.
[114:58.14]They're totally lost in the groove.
[115:01.10]Hey, I love this song!
[115:02.04]Ring-a-ding-dong!
[115:02.94]Isn't this mix Shway?
[115:05.20]Shway?
[115:15.12]Raft, if we can get them all to dance, we can win.
[115:17.17]Alright, so Sweet's dancing.
[115:21.77]Let's just do the same thing.
[115:22.61]Let's do KK's dance.
[115:27.15]Everyone dance with KK.
[115:27.97]They're totally lost in the groove.
[115:33.08]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[115:34.86]Dance, dance.
[115:35.34]Everybody dance.
[115:35.92]Hey, I love this song.
[115:44.64]Mmm, watch out for the baseballs up top.
[115:46.14]Alright, Sweet snapped out of the dance!
[115:47.58]Uh-oh.
[115:48.48]Oh, shit.
[115:49.79]Wait, wait, I can't dance with bad guys?
[115:53.35]Alright, so we have to do... just the regular dance.
[115:57.63]Because then... yeah.
[116:01.12]No, no, rude damage.
[116:05.50]Shit.
[116:12.76]Because once somebody has it, the other one breaks out.
[116:14.54]Let's see what happens if I do the regular dance.
[116:20.68]You dance.
[116:21.91]Sweet got lost in the groove.
[116:24.17]Dance, dance, dance.
[116:25.31]Do they pay the venue fee?
[116:33.92]Ow, fuck.
[116:36.16]Okay, it snapped out of it.
[116:40.03]Wait, I can't dance with bad guys.
[116:41.17]I've got my next dance moves.
[116:42.25]Okay, so nobody's dancing.
[116:47.86]Shit.
[116:49.70]Alright.
[116:50.82]Maybe making one of them dance will make the other ones dance.
[116:53.46]Let's try that.
[116:53.96]Let's do it to Cap'n.
[116:57.87]Dance extreme.
[117:00.05]Everyone dance with Cap'n.
[117:01.03]They're totally lost in the groove.
[117:03.59]Wait, you want to see my moves?
[117:15.12]Hey, is this really working?
[117:17.79]Maybe if Chris, um... Maybe if we tried ballroom dancing instead.
[117:22.31]Hey, why the hell do we need Chris to act?
[117:26.79]Because that's, um, Chris's unique talent.
[117:29.75]So... You think I'm too stupid to dance by myself?
[117:33.80]Susie learned S-action.
[117:35.38]She can act from her magic menu.
[117:37.40]Okay.
[117:39.65]Susie, I don't think you should... Happy feet, dumbass.
[117:44.02]Susie made Rousey learn our action even though he didn't want to.
[117:49.01]Oh, it's a Charlie Brown dance.
[117:52.63]I'm sorry, Chris.
[117:54.69]Okay.
[117:55.49]So now they can actually do it.
[118:00.89]So sweet, dance, magic, S action, dance, then magic, R action, dance.
[118:11.00]There we are.
[118:11.90]Okay.
[118:14.62]Everybody's dancing now.
[118:16.28]Everyone is dancing.
[118:38.46]Battle won.
[118:39.18]Alright.
[118:44.10]Feel the beat.
[118:44.88]Watch my moves.
[118:45.84]Dance, dance.
[118:47.58]Hey losers, wrap it up.
[118:48.74]Battle's over.
[118:51.60]Over?
[118:52.99]In other type words, we lost?
[118:58.21]Does that mean we can be friends?
[119:00.97]KK, no!
[119:02.89]Fighting's not really my style anyways.
[119:04.45]Yeah, because you're a coward.
[119:07.40]I mean, it was fun dancing, but... Sweet, don't worry.
[119:09.78]I think our dancing beat them.
[119:12.36]Beat them?
[119:12.86]Yeah.
[119:13.43]All mercy-like.
[119:15.09]See, when we dance with them, it convinced them we're cool.
[119:18.45]Now they're on our side.
[119:19.47]Yes.
[119:20.55]Hey, you three.
[119:23.61]Welcome to the good side.
[119:25.95]We are the good side.
[119:27.25]Just go with it.
[119:28.39]Let's rendezvous at our junk shop.
[119:31.72]We jammed the door shut, but we'll kick it open.
[119:35.20]Alright, everybody.
[119:35.90]Let's go.
[119:44.43]Ooh.
[119:46.51]Very cool.
[119:48.39]Very cool.
[119:58.91]Gotta watch out, probably.
[119:59.83]Yep.
[120:00.37]Well, why are they still doing this?
[120:01.33]We're friends.
[120:01.81]Oh, no.
[120:04.61]We're fine.
[120:11.00]Oh, the hacker.
[120:12.04]He's hacking the fireworks.
[120:19.17]I'm not gonna run through this.
[120:20.05]I'm gonna wait.
[120:21.01]He's cute.
[120:32.19]Jerma says, very cool, like he's trying to placate a giant beast.
[120:37.04]What?
[120:39.92]What?
[120:40.56]Oh, very cool, very cool.
[120:46.76]Very cool.
[120:50.06]What's that tweet that that thing that somebody said before like a year or two ago?
[120:55.64]This stream is just me.
[120:57.12]It's as if I'm talking to like a room full of just angry chimpanzees That at the turn of a moment could just lash out and try to attack and kill me.
[121:06.01]What is it?
[121:06.33]What was it?
[121:06.61]That's like this whole stream or something It's like I'm trying desperately to like calm a bunch of like angry chimpanzees What was it what was it called somebody's got it somewhere
[121:37.31]That's pretty much it.
[121:38.69]Just keep standing there.
[121:43.10]Hey, somebody pull up a two-year-old tweet right now.
[121:50.50]Oh no, links are banned, right?
[121:51.82]Forever, I forgot.
[121:54.81]Oh, here it is.
[121:55.15]Okay.
[121:55.83]Jerma talks to his chat like they're apes with a very loose grasp on human language.
[122:01.26]And if he fails, they will rip him to shreds.
[122:05.94]Jerma talks to his chat like they're apes with a very loose grasp of human language.
[122:17.68]That's so funny.
[122:25.41]Is this the shop?
[122:27.03]It's a lone doorframe, but for some reason you can't see through it.
[122:36.37]Oh, here's the shop.
[122:38.31]I heard this unassuming store is the rebel base.
[122:41.56]But I realize I don't really know how I would help them.
[122:48.38]I'm sitting here going...
[122:51.38]Okay, guys, look at me.
[122:53.32]Look at me.
[123:00.63]Guys, so I was at the store yesterday, and I got a Dunkin' Donuts large iced coffee.
[123:07.05]And, dude, I'm telling you, it was fucking gross.
[123:09.93]It was the grossest coffee I've ever had in my life.
[123:11.47]It was disgusting.
[123:17.02]I don't know where I can't see the thing on the screen.
[123:20.30]I have no idea where it is.
[123:22.04]I'm not going to do that, though.
[123:22.89]I don't know where it is.
[123:23.89]I'm not going to do it.
[123:24.43]I'm going to move on.
[123:28.89]I'm going to move on.
[123:30.19]I'm not going to do it.
[123:30.85]I don't know where it is on the screen.
[123:31.83]I can't see it.
[123:33.13]So I'm just going to be done.
[123:38.08]Alright.
[123:38.34]I'm going back.
[123:38.90]I'll go back.
[123:39.26]I'll go back.
[123:39.56]I don't know.
[123:39.82]Where is it?
[123:40.22]Where is it?
[123:45.66]Okay, I can't see it.
[123:46.88]I have no idea where the fuck it is.
[123:48.12]You guys are fucking gaslighting the shit out of me.
[123:50.55]Stop.
[123:51.41]I'm not- I don't care.
[123:52.71]I'm not gonna do it.
[123:53.39]Alright, I'll do it right now.
[123:54.19]I'll do it.
[124:13.78]Tear him apart.
[124:14.60]No!
[124:16.58]I told you I was going to go back.
[124:18.04]I couldn't see what you were looking at.
[124:19.68]Get off me!
[124:22.22]There's so many of you.
[124:23.12]Hold on.
[124:24.98]This is important.
[124:33.59]Woof, woof, woof!
[124:34.41]Woof, woof, woof!
[124:37.66]Woof, woof, woof!
[124:40.58]Woof, woof, woof!
[124:43.62]Oh, hey, guys.
[124:44.50]Hey, you ever pick up the phone and somebody... It's a wrong number.
[124:49.66]And you say, oh, hey, wrong number.
[124:51.50]Hey, screw you, buddy.
[124:53.52]You know what I mean?
[124:54.44]Like, that's a +2.
[124:55.72]No, no, no, no.
[124:56.88]Get the fuck out of here.
[124:58.80]Get the fuck out of here.
[125:00.34]I wonder if your neighbors can hear you.
[125:20.39]Monkey laugh track?
[125:29.35]Yo, what's up?
[125:30.35]Hey.
[125:35.83]My neighbors.
[125:37.27]Why is this person doing this?
[125:40.36]For more than 10 seconds?
[125:43.22]That's way too long to do a monkey, like, chimpanzee impression.
[125:49.59]Right?
[125:50.07]That's way too long.
[125:51.74]I did it for like two or three straight minutes.
[125:58.59]Wah!
[125:58.85]Wah!
[125:59.11]Wah!
[125:59.31]Wah!
[126:01.55]Whatever.
[126:04.13]I got my laugh track ready.
[126:05.99]No, hold on.
[126:06.91]It's gotta be better.
[126:07.91]Like, you guys gotta get... This is gonna be accurate.
[126:09.91]So we got two that are fine, right?
[126:13.34]Alright, so that one's a good one.
[126:18.52]So we have to have a really, really, like... A really, like, angry one.
[126:35.95]That's good.
[126:36.83]And this one... No, that's bad.
[126:38.07]This one is good.
[126:38.81]No, no, no.
[126:43.37]I got better.
[126:43.77]This is good.
[126:52.84]So now if I see a bunch of minus twos, I know what to press.
[126:55.38]And if I see a lot of plus twos, I know what to press.
[127:01.07]And it's if you don't like it, if you don't think it's funny.
[127:04.69]Okay.
[127:07.60]Play the game.
[127:08.26]Alright, yeah, yeah.
[127:08.94]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[127:14.50]It's Monkey Friday.
[127:16.30]That's enough.
[127:17.20]Okay, let's go.
[127:22.43]Okay, about yourselves.
[127:24.43]I'm sweet.
[127:25.35]The ladies call me Cap'n.
[127:26.93]Hey, Cap'n.
[127:31.82]We used to work the sound in this town until Queen came around.
[127:36.40]KK is short for cakes.
[127:40.70]She made music against the law.
[127:42.86]Unless you make a song she likes, but the only junk she enjoys are reverse diss tracks where the vocalist puts themselves down and praises the Queen.
[127:58.56]Or noise music.
[128:01.19]But even if Queenie tries to put a limiter on us, you can't stop the music.
[128:06.69]Hear that?
[128:07.58]We'll just go underground.
[128:08.86]Crash, boom, bang!
[128:11.88]That's why we made this junk shop.
[128:13.16]We'll fund our musical rebellion.
[128:15.56]Can we make noise music too?
[128:19.37]Okay.
[128:20.57]Performance?
[128:23.25]You wanna see what we got?
[128:24.87]Can you handle this?
[128:26.15]Hold on to your antennas.
[128:31.54]How was that?
[128:32.32]How was that or how was that?
[128:35.34]I liked it.
[128:37.04]That was good.
[128:41.18]All our songs are only four seconds long.
[128:45.69]Okay.
[128:49.99]A queen wasn't always so harsh.
[128:52.33]No, she was.
[128:53.79]She just got worse somehow.
[128:56.11]It wasn't until that dark fountain showed up.
[128:58.62]She started going into overdrive.
[129:02.62]Knight this, knight that, fountain that.
[129:05.30]Like, what does that knight even have going for it that I can't?
[129:07.98]That I don't?
[129:08.90]Come on, Gwen.
[129:12.11]Zoomer TikTok musicians.
[129:18.69]But like I said, she wasn't always so bad.
[129:20.85]She used to give me sweets for being so sweet.
[129:24.35]Oh, I never got candy.
[129:28.65]He kept calling her a haunt mama cap.
[129:31.98]Yeah, is that wrong?
[129:32.86]She looks like a mom and tends to overheat.
[129:36.31]KK, help me out here.
[129:37.77]What do you think?
[129:38.73]Me?
[129:39.97]I like candy.
[129:41.66]Yeah, you're right, KK.
[129:42.38]We gotta focus on what's important.
[129:43.66]If the band fights, we'll get out of tune.
[129:46.10]Anyone have any lemon drops?
[129:49.72]I blew my voice out doing the fucking chimpanzee shit.
[129:52.38]It's gone.
[129:52.64]I'm only two hours in.
[130:21.67]Now all we gotta do is follow the blueprints, right?
[130:24.09]It'll be our big time break.
[130:26.47]Yeah, haha, it's gonna break apart big time.
[130:33.78]Ah, I need some, I need some more water.
[130:36.68]Alright, so now we can buy?
[130:38.88]CD bagel.
[130:39.98]You gotta make it cheaper than that, what the hell?
[130:42.52]Mecha saber.
[130:45.86]Alright, I have a question.
[130:46.54]This is a backseat question for all you guys.
[130:50.60]If I'm going to try to just do the kind of passive fist run, should I even buy the weapons?
[130:57.23]Is there even a reason to buy them?
[130:59.61]If I don't plan on swinging the sword once?
[131:01.13]There's no point, right?
[131:06.55]Okay, well, I...
[131:09.96]Should probably buy a couple things here.
[131:14.68]Buy a... Because I only... Let's buy... No.
[131:17.65]I'm going to buy another one.
[131:20.37]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[131:22.41]What can I sell?
[131:23.97]Sell pocket items.
[131:24.95]You got nothing.
[131:25.77]Sell armor.
[131:27.93]Sell the Amber cards, right?
[131:28.91]Because I don't need these.
[131:37.81]Don't sell them?
[131:38.41]Should I sell?
[131:39.14]Oh, no, no.
[131:39.36]Okay, I did.
[131:40.80]Sell weapons.
[131:41.54]No.
[131:42.30]Sell items.
[131:43.72]No.
[131:44.84]You can craft.
[131:45.38]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[131:45.98]You're right.
[131:47.82]Alright.
[131:49.48]Uh... Cool.
[131:51.54]Thanks, guys.
[131:52.32]See ya.
[131:52.80]Spell ya.
[131:58.58]There is a terrific noise coming from the building nearby.
[132:00.79]You're filled with the power of noise music.
[132:07.09]Okay.
[132:08.95]Do I have full HP?
[132:09.61]Yeah, I do.
[132:14.23]Whoa.
[132:16.99]I should fight these guys because I want to have a recruit 5 out of 5, right?
[132:19.45]Oh, wait.
[132:19.85]Hold on.
[132:22.41]Smorgasbord 2.
[132:23.09]Alright, so we need to... You're already tired, so I'm just going to pacify you.
[132:28.57]So we might as well... You.
[132:33.40]We're going to do a roar on you.
[132:39.34]And then we're going to do a... Wait, oh shit, I hit the wrong button.
[132:46.92]Alright, roar!
[132:48.46]On... Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[132:52.96]Our action... Bear wire.
[132:56.78]Wait, no, fuck.
[132:57.50]I wanted to pacify.
[133:00.02]Wait, what?
[133:00.36]Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm stupid.
[133:01.44]Okay, loosen up a little bit.
[133:06.86]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[133:10.06]Sorry, I screamed out all my energy.
[133:17.07]Honestly, let's think of chimpanzees in the fucking wild.
[133:20.57]Holy shit, how are you not sleeping 20 hours a day?
[133:27.75]Just like screaming.
[133:29.55]I'm ready to go sleep.
[133:33.73]Okay, so we're, Chris, we're gonna act where everybody's tired.
[133:38.09]So we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna go ahead, and we're gonna go ahead, and we're gonna jiggle the wire.
[133:45.66]Then we're gonna go ahead and S-action you.
[133:50.72]Wait, what?
[133:52.14]Oh, I'm so dumb.
[133:53.02]Okay.
[133:53.84]S-action, standard.
[133:54.62]No, no, no, no, no.
[133:55.06]It's just a pen.
[133:57.99]And then you're going to do pacify on anybody.
[134:01.65]Probably you.
[134:15.28]I can't imagine screaming for like 15 straight hours.
[134:18.46]Okay, so that means now let's do... I'll just defend.
[134:28.79]I mean, they're gonna... Might as well.
[134:46.20]So once they're tired, my brain is flogged right now.
[134:49.84]Can I just keep doing that until... Let's say, for instance, can I just keep jiggle jiggle and then not necessarily pacify?
[134:56.86]Will that take it off?
[135:05.16]No.
[135:05.66]Okay, so they have to be pacified.
[135:12.19]Once they're tired, they just stay tired.
[135:15.44]I got the three checkmarks.
[135:16.26]Yeah, I did.
[135:20.42]They can only be spared if they're yellow.
[135:23.10]Test.
[135:24.74]Yes!
[135:32.61]Tension bit.
[135:35.29]Add it to items.
[135:35.99]Tension bit.
[135:42.37]Raises TP by 32% in a battle.
[135:43.77]Okay.
[135:47.00]Um, I need to do something.
[135:49.02]If I can do it, I'm going to try to.
[135:50.51]Controls.
[135:51.87]Yes.
[135:52.95]Confirm is going to be... Alright.
[135:57.09]Cancel the... I need to change this to be... Menu X. Yeah, that's fine.
[136:07.95]I don't want it to be... I keep pressing the wrong button.
[136:13.31]That's, like, confirm in my brain.
[136:15.38]That's where that is on the Xbox controller.
[136:25.38]He's actually insane.
[136:26.40]No, I'm not.
[136:27.52]Like, B to my brain is where A is on the Xbox controller.
[136:34.02]B on the Xbox controller is A in my brain because of Super Nintendo.
[136:39.90]So...
[136:42.05]Everyone's bullying.
[136:43.45]Okay.
[136:44.53]I don't know.
[136:46.37]Sit down.
[136:50.09]Sit down!
[136:55.96]Ehe, shall I help you save?
[137:00.12]No, I shan't.
[137:00.96]I haven't the faintest idea what that is.
[137:02.84]Ehehe.
[137:08.96]That feels way better.
[137:10.84]Yeah.
[137:11.24]Now I actually can play the game.
[137:13.00]Correctly.
[137:14.30]Did I miss anything?
[137:14.78]What's your opinion on chili dogs?
[137:19.66]Eh.
[137:20.60]Not really.
[137:24.88]I can't touch this thing?
[137:29.96]It's too much.
[137:30.44]It's too messy.
[137:32.10]I like the flavor.
[137:39.40]Why do I say bombs?
[137:42.46]Oh, if they hit that, they explode.
[137:44.48]Chest.
[137:46.85]Aw.
[137:47.13]What?
[137:50.59]Revive mint.
[137:51.73]Nice.
[137:51.95]Are there more of those?
[137:54.37]They have to hit the arrow.
[137:58.57]It has to hit it.
[138:01.21]Key.
[138:03.89]Nice.
[138:08.83]What else is up here?
[138:12.86]Wait.
[138:16.70]Was it something down here?
[138:17.56]That just opened the ability to go up or was there like something over here?
[138:23.31]Okay.
[138:34.03]Why does this sound like a Mario Party song?
[138:37.56]It is kind of Mario Party-like, isn't it?
[138:41.72]Oh, come on.
[138:42.28]Move.
[138:43.76]I gotta do arrow keys from the ship.
[138:55.93]Jesus.
[138:57.51]Jesus!
[138:57.93]63?
[138:59.15]I can do better than that.
[139:00.59]Go back.
[139:02.59]For the D-pad?
[139:04.49]No.
[139:04.55]D-pad actually probably would work, too.
[139:06.51]63?
[139:06.55]That's not good.
[139:18.62]Hey, what the hell are these things?
[139:21.30]Looks like if we ride them, they might bring us over to the fountain.
[139:26.34]Really?
[139:26.60]Then let's get on.
[139:30.18]I am just getting just flashbacks.
[139:32.75]That stupid-ass fucking Battletoads level.
[139:34.73]That was impossible without a GameShark or a Game Genie.
[139:39.15]Remember that dumb level where you had to ride the thing and it was impossible?
[139:41.91]You just crashed into everything?
[139:46.43]Enough, you... Okay, hold on.
[139:47.61]Excuse me.
[139:48.93]Enough, you foolish children.
[139:50.95]I have been merciful to you thus far, but now is time for your unwillful imprisonment.
[139:57.17]Capture.
[139:59.17]Drop the capturing capsules.
[140:02.63]Uh, you missed.
[140:07.15]That was not a miss.
[140:08.01]It was a tactical calibration.
[140:11.74]Are you going to try it again?
[140:12.78]Oh, no.
[140:15.58]I only have, like, four cages.
[140:19.47]Okay, wait.
[140:20.97]I have a small plot twist for you.
[140:23.93]Come forward, my... Eon.
[140:29.49]Um, sorry.
[140:30.17]I just couldn't say no.
[140:32.96]Noelle!
[140:34.64]Hi, Susie.
[140:35.48]Um, how are you?
[140:41.20]Uh, okay, I guess.
[140:45.50]Is everybody laughing my ass off?
[140:48.94]F-M-L-M-A-O.
[140:49.78]Why are you doing that?
[140:50.90]Your, um, roller coaster is, um, I like it.
[140:57.05]Oh, yours too?
[141:00.49]Thanks.
[141:06.32]Okay, this isn't working.
[141:07.30]Bring in the next guy.
[141:10.68]Fear not, my beloved Noel.
[141:12.02]This valiant warrior of brave intelligence will be your knight in glow in the dark armor.
[141:22.31]Birdly, you asked Birdly to be on your team?
[141:26.15]I did not ask him.
[141:27.31]I did not ask him.
[141:28.05]I did not ask him.
[141:30.90]That's Lord Birdly to you, simpleton.
[141:34.38]And soon, Super Lord Birdly.
[141:36.44]What the hell does that mean?
[141:41.16]I have no damn clue.
[141:43.16]Just go with it.
[141:45.20]You see, thanks to our wondrous queen, we will soon rule the world.
[141:50.99]And I'll turn this land of fools into smartopia.
[141:55.81]A true scientocracy where the geniuses of the world can bathe freely in pools of fresh fruit and ambrosia.
[142:04.90]By the way, this is something to think about.
[142:09.19]Ambrosia is supposed to be like the thing the gods ate.
[142:13.65]Right?
[142:15.01]Oh, and they sipped on ambrosia.
[142:18.30]Why did that turn into like a disgusting fucking dessert?
[142:23.08]That ambrosia is gross.
[142:29.12]That's what we say ambrosia is?
[142:33.10]What is it?
[142:33.32]It's like chunks of marshmallow and like potato salad.
[142:36.25]This is what the gods apparently ate?
[142:40.44]Oh, what?
[142:40.96]That sucks.
[142:41.76]What a shitty fucking dessert.
[142:48.53]It's because you're immortal.
[142:52.03]No, what is it?
[142:52.75]Okay, I'm serious.
[142:53.53]Like, I've had ambrosia, like, once and I was like, this, like, sucks.
[142:57.91]What is actually in it?
[142:58.77]It's... Yeah, this stuff is fucking gross.
[143:01.41]It's like macaroni salad and, like, fruit salad combined.
[143:04.19]There's, like, was it mayonnaise in this?
[143:07.52]Oh, the absolute, the fruit, the delectable of the gods.
[143:13.11]Oh, of course.
[143:15.29]What would be in it besides fruit salad and gross, cheap marshmallow cubes?
[143:28.15]Ah, yes, yes, bring me, yes, peon, bring me my ambrosia.
[143:32.50]I'll take that whipped cream out of the can.
[143:36.08]Mini marshmallows and fruits.
[143:39.62]It's as if a three-year-old sat down and made their own recipe.
[143:46.52]Bring it to me on a platter on silver.
[143:55.48]Why is it ambrosia?
[143:57.00]Yeah, okay.
[144:01.04]What?
[144:04.58]Thank you.
[144:05.17]Thank you.
[144:05.91]Thank you.
[144:07.50]Thank you.
[144:15.58]He's immortal.
[144:17.90]No, it's fucking... That's not like the desert of the gods.
[144:21.46]The desert of the gods is baklava.
[144:23.56]I'm telling you right now.
[144:25.26]That's what ambrosia is.
[144:26.86]Ambrosia was baklava, okay?
[144:29.55]Look it up.
[144:30.23]It had to be.
[144:31.39]Fucking ambrosia.
[144:33.09]No, it's either chocolate ice cream or it's baklava.
[144:35.73]Pick one.
[144:42.19]No longer held back by protozoans like you.
[144:48.74]And the key to that is us, Noelle and I. Our power, the light nerds power.
[144:56.82]The light nerds.
[145:02.36]Oh no, Queen said light nerds.
[145:06.25]Oh, I actually did.
[145:07.41]Thirdly, Queen's just manipulating you.
[145:13.71]That's what she said you'd say to me.
[145:17.03]I actually did that.
[145:20.23]Now Chris, you must admit, I feel pity for you.
[145:24.12]Unlike Susie, I always saw some potential in you.
[145:27.88]Join our side and I might let you scrub our royal toilet.
[145:41.99]What?
[145:43.15]Don't say it so incredulously.
[145:44.51]Well, if you're dead set on proving your inferiority,
[145:51.94]Allow me to assist you.
[145:53.12]Birdly rides in.
[145:56.24]What do we got?
[145:59.89]Check.
[146:00.35]Bump.
[146:00.83]Bump X. Check.
[146:02.91]Defend.
[146:03.99]Defend.
[146:04.89]Birdly, go use your roller coaster cars to play bump of chicken.
[146:11.56]Chris, I get why you're getting in my way.
[146:13.48]You're jealous, aren't you?
[146:22.42]Okay.
[146:23.16]Birdly gives the secret sign, but Queen is busy with a coloring book.
[146:26.54]Alright, so let's bump.
[146:29.60]Bump X. Everyone rides coaster.
[146:33.00]Whole gang will attempt to bump into Birdly's car.
[146:39.28]Chris, you're tired of being the class number three, gazing distantly at Noelle and I's fruited figures.
[146:52.67]Birdly shows Queen his card collection.
[146:54.34]Queen escaped successfully.
[146:55.82]Uh, we're just gonna keep doing this.
[147:00.56]Bump into Birdly's car.
[147:04.72]So rather than ever studying, you'd enlist Susie to take us down?
[147:08.74]Ooh, they have little pieces come out.
[147:15.83]Interesting.
[147:16.63]Birdly shows Queen his card collection.
[147:17.91]Queen escapes successfully.
[147:18.89]Alright, he's at 36% mercy.
[147:23.77]I'm just gonna keep doing it.
[147:28.51]Chris, you are truly depraved playing in the mud with the class.
[147:33.09]Hell yeah.
[147:36.91]I have so much magic right now.
[147:40.53]Alright, I should probably heal.
[147:45.67]Alright, Chris, you just normal bump.
[147:49.06]Susie, I would like for you to bump birdly.
[147:53.32]But Rousey, I would like for you to use magic on Susie.
[148:07.09]Chris, I am a kind and brave hero.
[148:08.89]If you come to our side, you may be a slightly less distant number three.
[148:14.45]Slightly.
[148:17.58]A+.
[148:22.24]What the fuck is going on in this game?
[148:24.42]Are they talking about studying in class that we're in?
[148:26.30]I don't know, this is weird.
[148:28.60]I want answers.
[148:32.12]Let's go for another super bomb.
[148:38.53]My car is breaking!
[148:40.33]Pools, this is smart smoke!
[148:42.23]It means my car is getting stronger!
[148:44.62]Go ahead, bump me, you bump-barians!
[148:47.34]I'll show you bumper cars is a game of intellect, not skill!
[148:52.01]Alright, Birdly's coaster car thing looks sick.
[149:04.03]Not quite.
[149:04.49]Alright, I need to heal.
[149:08.38]Regular bump.
[149:10.34]Regular bump.
[149:13.02]And heal yourself.
[149:22.45]Uh, car thing looks sick.
[149:34.07]96% now.
[149:34.45]Okay.
[149:37.25]Didn't play TSA.
[149:40.37]No, I didn't.
[149:41.71]So, you're right.
[149:43.75]Uh, let's just... Let's knock the car down.
[149:45.38]Uh-oh.
[149:52.20]My coaster.
[149:54.34]It's... Oh, what?
[149:56.76]That's not fair.
[149:59.42]My queen saved me.
[150:06.30]In a minute, dear.
[150:07.44]Hello, everyone.
[150:09.40]I have some news updates.
[150:11.70]You see, this roller coaster is not actually finished yet.
[150:19.12]What does that mean?
[150:21.27]Looks like this trash saved us.
[150:42.67]Come on Gwen.
[150:50.61]Oh, who's king of the trash pile now?
[150:56.89]Good reflexes there.
[150:58.07]Good reflexes.
[150:59.34]Very good reflexes.
[151:03.02]Suzy, are you alright?
[151:06.56]It's nothing.
[151:08.76]I just... Ooh, ow.
[151:13.78]Sure you don't want me to look?
[151:16.34]Look at... What?
[151:17.10]I'm fine.
[151:24.28]What are you doing?
[151:29.28]Feel better?
[151:30.96]Feel better after you just came up and I... Acting the... Acting.
[151:38.78]Oh, it doesn't feel worse, I guess.
[151:45.53]How do you do that anyway?
[151:48.51]That healing thingy.
[151:51.03]Oh, healing magic?
[151:51.81]It's simple, uh, Susie.
[151:54.27]Anyone can do it.
[151:56.41]I could even teach you if you're interested.
[151:59.85]Ask me again when it's like blood explosion magic.
[152:07.47]If you want it, I guess I could learn it.
[152:10.03]And you wouldn't, you know, have to annoy me with it anymore.
[152:14.43]Sure, Susie.
[152:16.11]Next time we have a break.
[152:18.87]Just go already, Chris.
[152:23.53]Is there like an Oscar the Grouch in here?
[152:25.55]You dug through the trash and found a dark candy.
[152:28.11]Dark candy was added to your items.
[152:29.79]Nice.
[152:34.09]It's a trash bag that looks like an eggplant.
[152:36.40]I was going to say cash register.
[152:37.54]Okay.
[152:52.03]Ho ho ho ho!
[152:53.13]I'm trying to think of... Oh, got it.
[152:57.17]Oh boy, oh boy, I'm trashy!
[152:59.93]Did you know about adjusting your inventory?
[153:03.03]Trash cans like me can hold all sorts of things!
[153:06.66]Just like your storage!
[153:08.32]If you get more than 12 items!
[153:13.44]Uh, yeah, not now, dude.
[153:16.22]It was sort of an emotional moment.
[153:19.42]Oh, oh, that's okay!
[153:23.49]Oh, hell, is that Newbert over there?
[153:25.47]Oh, Newbert's here.
[153:30.29]Sorry, trash can guy.
[153:32.59]This is an eggplant.
[153:38.31]I'm Newbert.
[153:39.27]Everybody loves me.
[153:41.08]That's why I live in this trash.
[153:52.07]No time for this guy.
[153:53.05]Alright, so should I go up?
[153:55.69]It's a lone doorframe, but for some reason, you can't see through it.
[154:03.55]That's my man... That's my man Newbert.
[154:08.65]By the way, Chris, I just remembered.
[154:09.85]Although you can only carry 12 items around, your storage will hold any extra items you pick up.
[154:15.25]Yeah?
[154:16.17]You can access it where you check recruits.
[154:18.99]Enemies you spare get recruited to our town, remember?
[154:22.86]Seems like pretty useful information.
[154:26.12]It is.
[154:32.35]There's a fork in the path, Chris.
[154:33.89]It seems like it might be advantageous if we split up.
[154:39.38]Who do you want to go with?
[154:42.74]Uh, well, Rousey has the heal, so I'm going to go with Rousey.
[154:48.85]I'm just basing this on how I feel.
[154:53.20]I'm going to go with Rousey because Susie does not have a heal right now.
[154:58.30]And I'm going with Rousey.
[154:59.68]That's my decision.
[155:01.08]That's what I've decided.
[155:02.90]If anybody wants to call me cringe like I just saw five people said cringe, that's fine.
[155:08.15]Apparently I'm cringe.
[155:09.49]I'm going with Rousey.
[155:13.25]Hey, why does Chris get to choose all the time?
[155:16.45]Rousey, you're going with me.
[155:18.93]Okay.
[155:27.94]I'm going to explain the joke.
[155:30.78]I didn't do the joke.
[155:31.46]I'm going to explain it though.
[155:35.61]Sit down.
[155:35.91]Sit down.
[155:36.15]Sit down.
[155:36.41]Not yet.
[155:38.83]I was going to just do like a fart sound.
[155:40.83]Like... And then go, man.
[155:44.41]I've been holding that in for like three hours.
[155:45.87]Thank God I'm alone.
[155:55.61]Alright, alright.
[155:57.19]Sit down.
[155:57.89]Sit down now.
[156:00.69]Somebody liked it.
[156:01.37]Somebody liked that.
[156:02.09]Somebody thought that was funny.
[156:04.27]I'm clearing that.
[156:04.87]We're not doing that again for the rest of the stream.
[156:07.09]I just cleared it.
[156:10.23]That voice is not happening anymore.
[156:11.27]We're done.
[156:13.86]I cleared it.
[156:14.42]I cleared it from the XLR.
[156:18.42]Can I do anything else?
[156:29.71]Oh shit, I can go this way.
[156:31.76]What's that?
[156:32.08]Somebody's trash house?
[156:48.66]The door is locked.
[157:02.04]Is that just, is that Trashy's house?
[157:03.84]I would assume it probably is.
[157:17.15]Don't look sad.
[157:18.07]You're never alone.
[157:19.63]You got Newbert.
[157:24.38]you can hold a lot more in your storage you know oh but you won't be able to use it during battle check it and make sure you have what you need it's what I wanted to say but I already said it why are you saying shush what don't shush me
[157:54.91]Welcome to the city.
[157:59.32]I just thought they were just back there.
[158:03.68]You have neither fluffy boys nor mean girls with you now.
[158:06.89]Reluctantly, you are filled with the power from the cat sign.
[158:25.41]I heard the roller coasters are undergoing maintenance.
[158:27.99]That's a pain because it's our only form of public transit.
[158:30.79]Oh.
[158:30.87]Okay.
[158:31.17]About how mad would you be?
[158:49.59]You're in a car, and you see somebody like just press the button, and the walk sign happened, everybody stopped, and they just don't move, and then they press it again.
[158:59.57]By the way, can somebody correct me here?
[159:00.93]I need to know this.
[159:02.38]I've been told like three different things about how that system works.
[159:07.52]Does that actually do anything?
[159:09.40]I've been told that when you press the button, it actually is just a placebo.
[159:13.08]It doesn't actually do anything.
[159:15.73]Is that accurate?
[159:19.34]Some of them do.
[159:20.74]Some do nothing.
[159:23.94]It depends.
[159:24.30]Depends on the city.
[159:26.48]So why have it?
[159:30.66]Is it to give the pedestrians something to do to make it feel like they're doing something?
[159:33.38]Is it a placebo effect?
[159:36.40]It depends on where, but most actually do something.
[159:39.67]Okay.
[159:41.49]I've heard conflicting information over the years.
[159:43.03]Cool.
[159:49.44]Oh god, this is Donkey Kong Country.
[159:52.14]In Donkey Kong Country, we have to jump and hit the lights and keep the lights on.
[159:58.20]Whatever it is, the stop thing.
[160:03.07]Oh.
[160:06.49]Oh.
[160:13.51]Nice.
[160:13.75]That level was brutal.
[160:17.43]It really was.
[160:18.25]It was horrible.
[160:21.48]What are we cleaning up for, you ask?
[160:23.82]We don't know.
[160:24.32]A parade, perhaps?
[160:26.00]Possibly?
[160:26.48]Hey, how bad are my peas?
[160:32.89]I have to switch out this thing, I think.
[160:35.05]When I say, like, Peter, Peter Piper picked a pickled peppers, right?
[160:41.19]It kind of sucks, right?
[160:44.21]Are you getting the pops?
[160:47.96]Because I feel like sometimes it happens.
[160:51.86]Is it good?
[160:55.02]I swear to God, I feel like it happens a lot.
[160:56.44]I think I have to get a new pop filter.
[161:01.20]A large event is going to happen in the streets later.
[161:03.76]We were told to make room for something big.
[161:11.25]Poor trash.
[161:12.81]Dug through the trash.
[161:14.35]Found $20.
[161:16.21]20 dark dollars was added to your money hole.
[161:18.27]What?
[161:23.92]They're making room for your ass.
[161:27.40]Good one.
[161:29.14]Whoa.
[161:30.76]Pop-ups popped up.
[161:31.94]I kinda wanna kill the pop-ups.
[161:35.07]Alright, pop-up.
[161:36.87]Uh, click or block?
[161:38.71]Click.
[161:39.23]I'm gonna click the pop-up.
[161:40.97]You unconsciously clicked on an ad for a video about making knives out of spaghetti.
[161:48.51]That made another one.
[161:51.09]Click here, click here, click, click!
[161:54.71]Oh, that sucks.
[161:59.17]UpUp is preening its weird rubbery flesh.
[162:01.59]Alright, block.
[162:03.84]Of course, why repeatedly block the adds?
[162:10.20]Block 10 adds.
[162:11.24]Happy.
[162:14.44]Oh, now I can see.
[162:19.37]Okay.
[162:20.55]Spare.
[162:29.45]It's easy with no ads.
[162:30.61]Now click it again.
[162:34.72]No.
[162:35.26]I don't want to click the ad again.
[162:44.48]I clicked it once.
[162:50.66]CD bagel.
[162:51.32]Nice.
[163:00.61]Okay, what are you doing here?
[163:03.99]Who are you?
[163:04.97]And what are you doing here?
[163:07.05]Chris, what are you... Oh, Noelle, sweetie.
[163:12.66]Don't let her find me.
[163:16.12]Noelle, sweetie darling, honey, where are you?
[163:19.22]We're a team now, remember?
[163:20.66]You still have to be my willing minion.
[163:25.12]Chris, it appears our comrades have pressed the escape key on us.
[163:32.31]So let's come to this.
[163:34.17]In order to find our teams, we must form an uneasy truce.
[163:46.92]Queen, my splendid queen, where are you?
[163:56.98]Chris, not the life form I was looking for.
[163:59.64]Where's the rest of the C-plus squad?
[164:05.19]Don't tell me you've got abandoned.
[164:09.87]That's what you get for trusting Susie.
[164:12.33]Huh?
[164:14.57]Well?
[164:16.15]Fiend?
[164:17.49]They're just busy retro gaming somewhere.
[164:21.65]I bet they're waiting for me on the player select screen.
[164:25.22]Listening to strangely groovy music.
[164:32.44]So it's come to this.
[164:34.88]In order to find our respective teams, it appears we must form an uneasy truce.
[164:44.07]What the?
[164:44.99]Beep said you could double truces.
[164:49.03]Huh?
[164:49.83]Did you hear something?
[164:54.41]No, it's just the sounds of the city.
[164:56.19]Oh, okay.
[165:00.38]Well, I'll be ahead.
[165:02.36]Don't be late.
[165:06.24]First, as part of our truce, better one, keep distracting Birdly and find Noelle.
[165:12.77]For, you see...
[165:15.08]Ah, birdly he's.
[165:19.24]Okay, there's nothing wrong with him.
[165:20.49]He's just annoying.
[165:22.59]Toodles.
[165:23.01]Yes, I, um, if it's okay, got anywhere for another truce?
[165:33.65]No triple truces.
[165:37.37]Yeah, we can have another truce, I think.
[165:40.25]Yeah, what do you mean triple truces?
[165:45.53]No triple truces?
[165:46.81]No, that's... No, I'm saying of course.
[165:49.63]Thanks, Chris.
[165:50.99]Well, join the party.
[166:00.64]What is the sugar for?
[166:07.42]So, um, any idea where Susie is?
[166:10.32]What?
[166:10.48]What?
[166:10.72]I'm just asking.
[166:11.34]It's a normal question.
[166:14.79]I don't know.
[166:17.52]I don't know.
[166:17.92]I have no idea where she is.
[166:22.12]What's that?
[166:24.36]What's that?
[166:25.38]What's that?
[166:25.74]What's that?
[166:26.46]What's this?
[166:28.42]What's that?
[166:28.94]What's that?
[166:29.32]What's this?
[166:33.14]Um, mmm... Mouse?
[166:39.41]Sorry, Chris.
[166:40.07]Could you deal with them?
[166:40.91]Maybe you can get them in the other mouse hole?
[166:45.21]Annoying mouse room.
[166:46.38]Okay, well, I... So they come out.
[166:52.14]They bounce.
[166:53.62]Hold on, how do they bounce?
[166:56.58]Alright, so we gotta go like this.
[166:58.30]Are I using these?
[166:58.90]I know, I know.
[166:59.35]What does that do?
[167:03.07]Oh, not quite.
[167:04.85]I'm gonna move it over here.
[167:09.13]Thank you!
[167:10.21]Uh, thank you.
[167:16.00]Wait.
[167:17.60]Mice will rotate 90 degrees when they collide with the block.
[167:19.66]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[167:20.34]I figured it out.
[167:25.68]Why?
[167:32.35]Have I already recruited all these?
[167:33.69]What does Noelle do?
[167:36.41]What's going on?
[167:36.95]What are we doing?
[167:44.01]What are you telling me to do?
[167:44.93]Act?
[167:46.41]Can someone please explain what's going on?
[167:48.91]Boy, is this your first time in a battle?
[167:51.15]Uh, well, yes.
[167:53.47]Oh, boy.
[167:56.09]You and Viril Virilcon explained how battles work to Noelle.
[168:01.16]I get it.
[168:01.44]It's kind of like Dragon Blazers.
[168:03.22]And if we're nice to you, we can win through mercy.
[168:06.58]Yeah.
[168:08.00]And the way I have to do that is dressing up in a weird costume.
[168:12.41]Yeah.
[168:15.42]You and Noelle show the enemy tender, loving care.
[168:19.29]Nice.
[168:24.89]Ah.
[168:30.35]Spare.
[168:30.99]Okay, buy.
[168:36.51]What am I buying?
[168:39.37]This is a new enemy.
[168:41.81]Ambulances beeped towards you.
[168:47.14]This girl's so sweet.
[168:49.30]Let's give her free bullets.
[168:51.03]Okay, what the fuck?
[168:53.85]Making siren noises with its mouth.
[168:56.59]You won.
[169:17.71]Alright, so we go... Let's check this guy out.
[169:21.77]We are Addison.
[169:23.19]All we do is advertise.
[169:25.23]This is an advertisement too.
[169:27.21]Advertisements now only $9.99.
[169:31.04]Don't like advertisements?
[169:32.30]Block ads for only $9.99.
[169:33.60]Change your mind?
[169:34.82]Bring them back for only $9.99.
[169:35.70]I was just going to run an ad.
[169:45.14]But I don't want to delete a third of the audience here.
[169:54.24]Don't like advertisements, block ads.
[169:56.11]Oh, same thing.
[169:59.55]Wait.
[170:00.51]Up or should I go right?
[170:01.95]Let's go right first.
[170:05.41]Let's go up first.
[170:11.46]Whoa.
[170:13.16]Susie, she's right there.
[170:14.14]I can't get the courage to say anything.
[170:18.56]Who's that person she's with, anyway?
[170:21.11]It's kind of like... Oh, they're looking over here.
[170:23.71]Let's go.
[170:26.66]How come they get to have fun at the carnival?
[170:28.60]Watch out for the cars.
[170:53.87]Watch out for the cars!
[170:56.27]What?
[170:57.11]Hey!
[170:58.21]Hey!
[170:59.83]Hey!
[171:00.57]Hey!
[171:02.41]We did it.
[171:05.21]Can't even cross the street without getting my ass kicked.
[171:07.90]I love this city.
[171:11.52]Since everyone else got plugged, they're a lot more agreeable.
[171:14.96]It's nice.
[171:15.44]Plugged?
[171:21.52]Jesus.
[171:26.25]Your cousin from Boston.
[171:31.81]Why did you say that?
[171:33.87]Now you got me all fucked up.
[171:35.09]Why did you say that?
[171:53.72]Your cousin from Boston.
[171:58.59]Uh, can I do... What can I even do to you?
[172:01.98]Well, offered a cold compress.
[172:08.14]Yeah, I'm home free.
[172:13.42]I love that those commercials really just made it seem like everybody from Boston just carries around a six-pack.
[172:19.69]Everywhere.
[172:20.87]Even to the fucking doctor.
[172:24.01]Just a six-pack in your hand.
[172:26.45]In the waiting room and in the doctor's office and shit.
[172:33.19]Oh, can't do it quite yet.
[172:38.01]Don't they?
[172:48.44]Oh, the green monster.
[172:49.48]Yeah.
[173:02.50]Jerma's from Vegas now.
[173:03.58]He doesn't count anymore.
[173:04.66]What?
[173:05.44]What do you mean?
[173:09.57]It's an advertisement for a giant Ferris wheel.
[173:12.19]Gosh, that's amazing.
[173:13.27]Makes the one at the festival look like a toy.
[173:15.11]I wonder if Susie would want to... Gosh, who am I kidding?
[173:22.95]I will ride with you.
[173:29.57]No, I think she would.
[173:31.48]I think Susie, I think Susie would.
[173:34.04]Really?
[173:34.34]You really think so?
[173:35.42]Ah, I think so.
[173:37.36]Susie expert, Chris.
[173:40.34]Hey, Chris, how'd you become the Susie expert?
[173:53.33]Oh, two young beings together on a school night.
[173:57.28]Would I interest you in some brand new dating shoes?
[174:00.04]Huh?
[174:02.00]No, you've got it totally wrong.
[174:03.54]Chris and I are just, um, friends?
[174:07.13]This has been my neighbor forever.
[174:08.89]We've been through so much.
[174:09.77]Sometimes it feels like we know each other better than anyone.
[174:13.63]And somehow, it's hard to say we're exactly friends.
[174:19.11]I... I mean... We're... That's... No, we're friends.
[174:26.49]Yep, that's right.
[174:27.03]We're friends.
[174:27.45]We're friends.
[174:28.41]It's surprisingly nice just hearing... Yeah, we're just friends.
[174:30.09]We're friends.
[174:35.46]Ah, you two don't look together.
[174:38.12]Can I interest you in some brand new divorcing shoes?
[174:46.02]Yeah, that's it.
[174:46.94]I'm okay.
[174:51.07]Where do I, how do I, where do I look?
[174:57.31]Who is this guy?
[174:59.81]Hey.
[175:00.85]Got any way to deal with crushing existential dread?
[175:04.81]Asking for a friend.
[175:05.47]A friend that looks and sounds exactly like me.
[175:10.90]You're talking about me!
[175:23.99]That's best joke of the game so far.
[175:28.13]Without a doubt.
[175:31.17]That was definitely the best routine so far.
[175:39.60]No, leave me alone!
[175:40.60]Why do I get to move?
[175:49.70]I go down?
[175:50.32]Oh, I go down.
[175:54.43]Oh.
[175:55.21]Hey.
[175:56.85]Looks like you need to hold it down.
[175:57.97]Yeah, can you stand over here?
[176:00.25]You keep standing on this one.
[176:03.03]I'll stand on this one.
[176:05.49]And now you come over here.
[176:06.23]Nice teamwork.
[176:09.45]Yeah.
[176:10.69]That was nice teamwork.
[176:17.32]I'm lost in the craftsmanship of the boxes.
[176:29.11]Oh, it's the queen.
[176:29.91]She's right over there.
[176:30.63]Can you distract her somehow?
[176:35.96]Oh!
[176:37.90]I'm laughing my ass off!
[176:39.84]You're here?! !
[176:42.07]Sorry, Chris.
[176:43.23]While I've been looking for Noelle, I've had like four of these all ages appropriate.
[176:48.43]Glasses of pure battery acid.
[176:50.02]Don't worry, that was my throwing glass.
[176:57.54]It's safe.
[176:59.84]Look, Chris.
[177:01.84]Crisscross applesauce.
[177:04.02]Now that we are Truces, I feel like we are on the same mathematical wavelength.
[177:11.40]And you get me, Chris.
[177:13.14]You do not do... You do not do crazy things like have opinions or scream when I capture you.
[177:19.84]Or tell me horrible plans for Smart Boy theme park.
[177:24.71]I just cannot compute it.
[177:26.43]Why everyone else is so ungrateful.
[177:31.75]I learned that from Master Shake.
[177:33.41]Whoops, that was my extra dangerous glass.
[177:37.46]Chris, I just want to make everyone smile.
[177:43.88]And if I become an evil villain to accomplish that, is that bad?
[177:48.45]It's okay.
[177:52.21]You do not have to answer.
[177:56.99]You would be wrong.
[177:58.31]But Chris, while we're still truces, maybe we could make the most of it.
[178:04.03]We could play that game again.
[178:05.15]Wasn't that fun, Chris?
[178:09.07]Just you and me.
[178:10.79]Having a good time.
[178:12.11]No one else to get in the way.
[178:21.98]Queen!
[178:22.98]I've been looking everywhere to show you this.
[178:25.66]a monument to our greatness together.
[178:35.36]How do I put this?
[178:37.68]Very smart.
[178:41.64]So smart you are.
[178:42.74]I love tolerating you.
[178:44.30]I knew you'd be enamored.
[178:47.45]Such perfect taste.
[178:50.31]Very cool statues.
[178:52.53]I did not know you had nipples.
[178:57.14]I will soon in our ideal world.
[178:59.78]Chris, feel free to admire our artisanship.
[179:05.29]Wayne and I have plans to consider.
[179:08.93]Oh, yes.
[179:09.47]Oh, good.
[179:09.97]Looking forward to that.
[179:10.79]Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[179:13.74]Let's go, Burglary.
[179:18.22]Keep going.
[179:18.70]I'm right behind you.
[179:19.62]Procedurally lowering the volume of my...
[179:27.03]Sorry, Chris.
[179:27.77]I must alt-tab out of here.
[179:31.47]Wow, cool face!
[179:43.94]Cool face.
[179:46.04]Looks like my disguise worked.
[179:49.23]It's silly looking, but it beats hiding.
[179:51.01]Let's get going, Chris.
[179:59.32]Look, it's you.
[179:59.84]Oh.
[180:00.58]Oh.
[180:03.30]I can't see anything, haha.
[180:06.42]Guess I'll try not to wear it unless I have to.
[180:08.36]Okay, let's go for a real this time.
[180:14.18]What is this?
[180:16.43]That's a big laugh.
[180:17.23]That's like a fu- You.
[180:22.55]Chris, can you stop looking at this?
[180:30.64]You became lost in the craftsmanship.
[180:33.06]Why do I have to look at it twice?
[180:36.49]Because.
[180:38.29]There's so much to look at here.
[180:41.05]Chris.
[180:42.77]It's a work of art.
[180:43.57]What part are you looking at?
[180:48.11]If I say I like it, will you stop looking at it?
[180:50.07]Hey, isn't this thing just the best?
[180:54.31]This statue seems to suck bad.
[180:57.49]Chris!
[180:58.95]There's no reason to look at this.
[181:01.63]There's no reason to look at this anymore.
[181:02.69]There's no reason.
[181:09.06]Oh, it's our friends.
[181:13.04]Energetic music wafts from the boxes.
[181:15.90]Filled with the power of musical bagels.
[181:23.45]What'll it be, chief?
[181:25.39]Oh, I hope you didn't hear that.
[181:26.67]I think the music was covering it, but a frog sound came out of my mouth.
[181:29.89]You know what I mean?
[181:30.35]I internally burped.
[181:32.51]What'll it be, Chief?
[181:33.15]I got CD bagels, $80 pop.
[181:37.85]Uh, let's just talk.
[181:39.09]Who is that?
[181:39.85]Uh, Mad Moizelle?
[181:41.46]Leave her alone, Cap.
[181:43.14]Nice radio antenna you got there.
[181:44.58]Those are antlers, Cap.
[181:46.92]Huh?
[181:47.20]I- Oh.
[181:49.34]Let's play her a song. ...
[182:05.14]I was waiting.
[182:05.58]Good thinking, KK.
[182:06.61]Gotta have a way to get around.
[182:07.33]Honk honk.
[182:22.77]You like the big statue?
[182:23.73]Building it sucked.
[182:24.67]Took a lot of scrap.
[182:25.57]The other job we did was way better.
[182:27.68]It was big.
[182:29.24]It's gonna blow your mind.
[182:30.48]It was big.
[182:31.00]I don't think I need any items.
[182:37.36]All I have is bagels.
[182:39.72]Okay, I'm gonna buy... I'm gonna buy two bagels.
[182:48.66]Because I don't think I have a heal, right?
[182:49.72]I feel like there's probably a boss coming on here.
[182:56.65]What kind of bagels do you like?
[183:04.85]I like everything bagels.
[183:07.24]One problem with everything bagels, though, is you are going to have to clean your counter.
[183:10.92]Doesn't matter how careful you are, doesn't matter what you use for a plate or a thing to hold it.
[183:16.93]Little, like, bird seed is going to be all over your entire counter, and it's a pain in the absolute ass.
[183:24.51]If you take a bite out of an everything bagel, it's like being at the beach.
[183:28.29]Like, sand just gets in your underwear.
[183:30.71]But it's worth it.
[183:33.36]I like that.
[183:33.76]Wait, can I get another free sample?
[183:35.92]That means I have two shoes.
[183:57.86]Please, I'm begging you.
[183:58.62]These voices are cringe.
[184:01.09]What do you want me to do?
[184:02.47]This is the hottest tea shop.
[184:03.73]Hot, hot, hot.
[184:04.53]50% off.
[184:05.09]For $100, choose your own flavor.
[184:08.77]Sure.
[184:10.19]Okay, choose your own flavor.
[184:13.03]What?
[184:15.69]Me?
[184:19.55]Okay, here you go.
[184:21.55]Crisp tea was added to your items.
[184:26.09]What?
[184:31.16]Its own flavored tea.
[184:32.64]The flavor just says Chris.
[184:33.62]Okay, here you go.
[184:46.85]The well tea was added to your items.
[184:49.61]Alright, I'm running out of room.
[184:52.61]I found Lancer.
[184:58.70]Oh, thanks for the free sample.
[185:00.04]I couldn't eat another bite.
[185:12.34]Alright.
[185:14.99]Wait.
[185:15.61]I don't want to fight you.
[185:21.93]I don't want to fight you.
[185:23.21]Don't.
[185:24.43]Hey, what?
[185:29.59]They're already tired.
[185:31.33]Stop doing the fucking Boston guy thing.
[185:37.93]Wait, so how do I do this if I don't have, um, pacify?
[185:54.23]Oh, Noelle can do it, okay.
[186:09.14]Oh, sleep missed, spare tired.
[186:11.26]Okay, I see.
[186:11.98]Oh, it's all good.
[186:28.19]I think I can actually spare.
[186:29.19]It should work.
[186:33.08]Oh, I thought it was gonna be yellow.
[186:35.90]The first one was yellow.
[186:40.35]I did that only one time.
[186:41.09]Why was it not yellow this time?
[186:43.60]Fuck.
[186:47.62]And now you're... No, you're not.
[186:48.80]Alright, well, whatever.
[186:53.39]Sleep mist.
[187:00.29]I just... Oh, it's... I thought they were in front of me, not above me.
[187:11.14]Hottest tea shop.
[187:12.04]Okay, yeah, let's go over to the right.
[187:13.94]No.
[187:14.30]But if you don't choose a flavor, who will?
[187:16.20]Sleep mist will spare all.
[187:19.46]Oh, cool.
[187:20.43]What is this?
[187:23.23]It's a mannequin with a dress on it.
[187:24.73]Clothing store sale.
[187:27.57]Sale.
[187:28.57]We're selling this for 75% off.
[187:30.31]Only $300 dark dollars.
[187:33.19]Great doing business with you.
[187:35.41]It was added to your armors.
[187:49.23]Where is it?
[187:49.55]I don't see your armors?
[187:59.79]I don't see it.
[188:03.30]Where is it?
[188:04.16]Oh, mannequin.
[188:05.52]It's a mannequin with the clothes permanently... Oh.
[188:09.06]You fucking asshole.
[188:19.09]Bye, bye, bye, we're sold out.
[188:23.49]Whatever.
[188:23.83]Oh shit, alright.
[188:35.14]Wait, how do I get over there?
[188:39.15]Wait, do I have to go up?
[188:41.39]Oh god.
[188:41.81]Okay.
[188:44.11]Whoa!
[188:46.17]Oh no.
[188:48.23]Oh!
[188:50.25]Alright, here we go, ready?
[188:52.59]Three, two, one, go!
[188:54.45]Go!
[188:54.67]Looks like another electric wall.
[188:56.69]This hole has a switch inside.
[189:01.99]Oh shit, it's gonna be horrible.
[189:06.51]Is that something inside?
[189:20.41]What do you think?
[189:20.97]It's a hole for mice to enter into.
[189:26.53]Left, right, wait a minute.
[189:28.51]Oh goodness.
[189:29.12]Okay, well.
[189:29.74]I didn't even, what are you doing?
[190:00.44]How do you get them to come out?
[190:08.69]Why do they, how do they get them to come out?
[190:18.23]Oh, down, okay, sorry, my iced coffee is, okay, listen, listen, my iced coffee is huge.
[190:25.65]It's here, right in front of my monitor, on the bottom right side of my monitor, and it's fucking enormous and it's covering that text.
[190:35.14]So, okay, I get it.
[190:39.48]This is like a 32 ounce tall Starbucks cup.
[190:42.97]It's gigantic.
[190:46.35]The fuck do I do?
[190:48.17]Can't move.
[190:49.25]Oh god, I killed them.
[190:51.59]Oops.
[190:59.30]Okay, so they have to go- ugh, fuck.
[191:01.46]Alright, so, wait a minute.
[191:02.96]I gotta get the fir- first part right.
[191:04.66]That's not right.
[191:05.48]That's not right.
[191:06.80]Not right.
[191:08.94]That's not right.
[191:09.54]Not right.
[191:31.35]That's not right.
[191:32.55]Not right.
[191:33.15]That's right.
[191:34.03]Okay.
[191:34.37]Got it.
[192:02.70]Huh?
[192:03.58]The force field's still up.
[192:04.80]Why?
[192:05.02]Did we miss something?
[192:07.64]Hello?
[192:10.88]Oh.
[192:12.20]Do it again.
[192:12.50]Scare her.
[192:14.50]She's gonna get scared over it.
[192:18.91]I can't believe you made those mice do that.
[192:21.87]Huh?
[192:22.93]I guess landing on the switch turned off the force field.
[192:25.57]Let's go.
[192:25.89]Not yet.
[192:56.33]What am I doing?
[193:07.42]I mean, I looked at chat and chat said I need to go down and I'm cheating.
[193:10.96]I said no backseating.
[193:14.70]What are you guys doing?
[193:16.66]I saw somebody in chat said I need to go down.
[193:18.05]What did you do?
[193:33.04]Yeah, they made me do this.
[193:34.34]I didn't do it.
[193:36.36]Okay, here we go.
[193:40.93]Whoa!
[193:45.57]Alright, I got it.
[194:02.96]Go!
[194:03.16]Why would I want to go down?
[194:04.38]What the fuck?
[194:10.87]What?
[194:11.11]Go down!
[194:13.85]Oh my god, go!
[194:24.97]Go!
[194:26.35]Hurry up!
[194:29.89]Okay, so what the- I don't understand, what am I doing down here?
[194:35.85]Why did I do this?
[194:36.47]Go further down?
[194:37.91]What?
[194:38.33]More down here?
[194:39.31]What are you guys talking about?
[194:40.97]You have to do it on the yellow side, oh.
[195:11.00]I'm pulling my hair out.
[195:12.08]Leave your hair in!
[195:12.92]It's fine!
[195:15.36]What the fuck, dude?!
[195:16.92]I keep getting stuck on shit.
[195:37.63]This is fucking hard, man.
[195:38.85]This is hard.
[195:40.11]I keep getting stuck.
[195:51.18]Oh, there it is!
[196:01.56]No, there's blockages.
[196:03.02]It's like a maze.
[196:03.68]Okay, wait.
[196:10.45]It's like left, right, left, down.
[196:12.37]It's over.
[196:15.07]You have to go... It's like weird.
[196:17.79]This blockage is down there.
[196:25.12]Oh my fucking god.
[196:26.56]I don't get it.
[196:33.72]One, two... One, two...
[196:44.45]Oh my fuck.
[196:45.57]Oh, I think I got it.
[196:46.89]Come on.
[196:47.33]You got it.
[196:47.95]What did I do all this for?
[197:17.52]Okay.
[197:18.84]Wait.
[197:21.08]Oh.
[197:25.67]That's what I came down here for?
[197:27.25]It's a dumpster.
[197:27.99]Seems like there's a pillow inside.
[197:29.43]Okay.
[197:37.29]A room between.
[197:38.07]There is a room between.
[197:39.25]That was not worth it?
[197:43.31]Not really, no.
[197:52.75]It was worth it.
[197:53.99]I mean, it was kind of worth it.
[198:04.34]Oh fuck, I have to get back up.
[198:07.30]Can I go down even more?
[198:16.13]Just go left?
[198:17.03]Huh?
[198:25.20]Found them.
[198:25.86]Whoa!
[198:29.06]Why did they look so pleased?
[198:34.74]What is it?
[198:40.14]Is it in storage?
[198:49.47]Now it was worth it.
[198:50.15]Yeah.
[198:50.51]Alright.
[198:50.75]Collect powers?
[198:57.32]Act?
[198:58.16]Heal?
[198:58.90]No, what is it?
[199:02.58]Leave this room again and enter it.
[199:04.73]No.
[199:06.29]Look at your title.
[199:07.15]What's wrong with the title?
[199:09.27]What does it say?
[199:13.63]Delta ruins second chapter.
[199:18.67]What?
[199:20.59]It sucks.
[199:23.60]Right, well, remember, I haven't, I don't, I didn't like remember much of this shit from the first time I played this.
[199:30.88]I played it three years ago.
[199:33.28]And I don't know what happens in this game, so I can't make like a funny title to reference the game because it's been a while.
[199:38.06]Yeah, I did a refresher course, but I didn't think of any funny material to put here.
[199:45.85]I think that's, I think that's fine.
[199:49.19]What?
[199:49.63]What's wrong with it?
[199:52.33]Is there like a typo?
[199:57.52]Deltarune Second Chapter.
[200:00.22]That's not... What do I mean?
[200:04.48]The title?
[200:07.20]In-game termo.
[200:09.29]What?
[200:09.83]In-game title.
[200:11.41]What are you talking about?
[200:13.65]Just ignore them?
[200:14.93]Okay.
[200:49.24]I don't have an injury.
[200:50.22]What?
[200:53.82]Your character class is now Moss Finder.
[201:02.31]Um, alright, okay.
[201:04.37]Wait.
[201:08.00]It's a citizen's duty to properly rotate and release mice using the traffic signs.
[201:14.28]Engage and disengage.
[201:15.18]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[201:18.80]Cheese.
[201:19.66]Free cheese.
[201:20.24]Chris, you aren't going to touch that cheese, are you?
[201:25.10]I'm going to touch the cheese.
[201:28.22]You rub the cheese down like a beloved pet.
[201:30.85]Suddenly...
[201:34.66]Mouse, block the way.
[201:37.38]I love the mouse.
[201:39.96]Crap all?
[201:42.42]Crap all.
[201:47.04]Shit.
[201:47.70]I want it.
[201:48.06]I'm tired of being pushed around.
[201:50.58]Mouse is thinking about overly elaborate machines.
[201:58.31]Alright, let's get it.
[202:05.15]Shit!
[202:05.63]You think you're the big change?
[202:08.26]Got it.
[202:09.22]Caught the enemy.
[202:11.86]One to three.
[202:35.91]You won.
[202:36.75]Do I get the cheese?
[202:38.67]I never want to see cheese ever again.
[202:40.01]Cheese was destroyed in the heat of battle.
[202:43.09]Feels like you lost sight of what was important.
[202:45.30]Yeah.
[202:45.52]Wait, there's a chest over here.
[202:47.74]Brass!
[203:00.34]Oh, if you touch the cheese, it's like operation.
[203:04.48]I'm glad I did this though because I want to recruit three.
[203:13.65]Left, right, left, right.
[203:15.07]This way, that way, this way, that way.
[203:17.85]Is there a mouse on the screen?
[203:19.57]Oh, okay.
[203:20.03]I get it.
[203:20.49]Alright.
[203:26.42]Nice.
[203:27.12]Nice.
[203:40.92]Bear.
[203:41.30]3 out of 3.
[203:47.90]Oh, fuck.
[203:48.38]It's like you lost sight of what was important.
[203:52.26]Dammit.
[203:57.17]This feels too easy to get it, right?
[204:00.45]You open the chest.
[204:01.31]It was a seedy bagel.
[204:02.25]I probably should eat one of these.
[204:03.47]Yeah, I'm gonna eat one.
[204:07.47]Use a seedy bagel.
[204:20.83]The dead end?
[204:23.43]One of these... I?
[204:32.43]Switch didn't seem to work.
[204:35.43]Oh, the platform's falling.
[204:36.69]Help me.
[204:37.09]Come on!
[204:49.38]Aisle?
[204:53.75]Huh?
[204:56.61]Oh, sorry, Chris.
[204:57.28]You just saved me, didn't you?
[204:59.10]Oh my god.
[204:59.72]This one's falling too.
[205:01.74]Yeah.
[205:03.70]Who the fuck is this?
[205:06.74]Ah, Chris.
[205:07.20]Stuck on this population.
[205:10.20]I thought I heard Noelle calling for help.
[205:12.41]But... I get that sound.
[205:15.29]I get what that sound was now.
[205:16.67]Okay, I can't... The brain must... I can't read both.
[205:21.61]You read it.
[205:24.18]Stuck on a puzzle just like this one.
[205:25.56]He's but a powerless adult without my help.
[205:40.47]What?
[205:43.47]I love...
[205:52.26]I love mo... mo... I love mo... I love moo mouse.
[206:11.96]I love mouse.
[206:13.70]You love mouses?
[206:26.11]Fuck!
[206:27.73]Fuck!
[206:27.93]Fuck!
[206:29.05]I love mouse.
[206:31.48]How did you... How did you solve that?
[206:38.10]Even a broken clock is right once a day.
[206:43.18]And Chris, if anyone asks, I solved the puzzle.
[206:47.40]Not fair for you to get extra credit for a fluke.
[206:50.44]Get it?
[206:50.68]But no one think otherwise, especially Susie.
[206:54.41]You know, she just lorded over me.
[206:56.45]Oh.
[207:03.71]Gosh.
[207:04.91]You know, I don't think I'm afraid of mice anymore.
[207:07.21]Actually, I think they might be kind of cute.
[207:10.59]Let's keep going.
[207:11.10]Noelle is now immune to mice.
[207:15.48]That's good.
[207:18.74]Let me go to storage for a second.
[207:21.90]Alright.
[207:23.21]I have a dog dollar.
[207:27.19]Revive mid.
[207:28.07]Heals a fallen ally to max HP.
[207:30.01]Okay.
[207:31.75]Can I just store these T's?
[207:36.55]Dog dollar.
[207:37.17]A dollar with a certain dog on it.
[207:38.61]Its value decreases each chapter.
[207:42.00]Okay.
[207:43.18]Um, what do I do with this thing?
[207:52.06]I'm gonna keep the T's.
[207:57.38]You dug through the trash and found $20.
[208:03.35]You dug through the trash and found $80.
[208:05.13]Oh, pop up and mouse appeared.
[208:37.34]Well, cheered rightly.
[208:38.38]Come on.
[208:45.19]I don't like the mouse.
[208:46.07]I'll tell you why the mouse is the one that's hitting me the most.
[208:48.61]It's just the spiders from Binding of Isaac.
[208:51.19]Something about that movement pattern.
[208:53.03]They'll, like, move, pause, move, pause, move, pause, move.
[208:57.23]Nope.
[208:58.19]I hate it.
[209:05.99]It follows you.
[209:06.77]I know.
[209:20.04]It repeats your movements.
[209:23.98]It does?
[209:25.42]CD bagel.
[209:26.31]Actually, I'm going to eat one.
[209:45.85]Now what?
[209:49.22]Uh-oh.
[209:49.82]Noel, what are you doing with Chris?
[209:55.18]I, um... We have a truce.
[209:59.06]A truce with Chris?
[210:02.94]That's impossible.
[210:04.44]That would be double truces.
[210:07.38]Huh?
[210:09.24]Hurry not, my dearest Noel.
[210:11.52]I know what you really want to say.
[210:13.16]You do?
[210:16.68]Going along with all this?
[210:18.94]You feel forced, don't you?
[210:21.30]That's why you're not with Queen right now.
[210:23.34]Thirdly, you get it?
[210:27.75]Yes, I do!
[210:29.57]Chris is forcing you to be on their side!
[210:32.25]Kidnapper!
[210:34.27]Chris, our truce is over!
[210:37.91]Well, this may hurt, but it's to help you.
[210:43.58]Wait, just listen.
[210:46.58]Birdly blocks the way.
[210:47.48]Alright, what do we got?
[210:49.98]Birdly.
[210:51.00]Play smart.
[210:51.47]Let's check Birdly for fun and defend.
[210:55.61]Usually only gets this mad when you play games together.
[210:57.87]Chris, I get it.
[211:00.33]Your head's gotten big from solving that puzzle by dumb luck.
[211:07.10]Oh, this is tricky.
[211:07.96]Okay, okay.
[211:09.34]I've got to get the pattern out.
[211:12.91]Alright, let's do, uh, play dumb?
[211:16.31]Play dumb.
[211:16.67]Play dumb and I need to heal.
[211:21.49]Ice Shock?
[211:31.42]You acted like you were an idiot next to Birdly's genius.
[211:35.78]Ah, Chris, a shame.
[211:36.98]I must have beat this episode lowly.
[211:39.22]Birdly liked that.
[211:41.54]Okay.
[212:04.99]Noelle tried to talk to Birdly.
[212:08.13]Birdly, I'm glad you're trying to help me.
[212:09.67]You need to thank me, dearest Noelle.
[212:13.63]Accidentally complimented.
[212:17.54]Guess what, Chris?
[212:18.14]I have one or two more things you'll never have.
[212:20.38]Behold, comrades!
[212:22.48]Fuck.
[212:32.40]Alright.
[212:33.34]I need to... play smart.
[212:37.26]You encouraged Noelle to use her mind.
[212:39.80]Her magic increased, Birdly found her smarts appealing.
[212:43.12]That's right, Chris.
[212:43.72]Unlike you, I have a loving team behind me.
[212:45.98]And you'll never beat us fighting alone.
[212:49.20]Somebody said, please kill Birdly.
[212:53.50]Um... I... Hold on.
[212:58.17]Um... No, I can't.
[213:04.59]Shit.
[213:04.77]Alright, act.
[213:06.61]I gotta get rid of these guys.
[213:08.63]So, I'm gonna heal her, and she's gonna do the mist.
[213:21.75]Bye.
[213:22.49]My allies are gone?
[213:23.53]They're probably just helping Queen search for me.
[213:26.34]Shut up.
[213:32.26]Okay.
[213:36.54]Early crushes his smart scouter out of frustration.
[213:39.39]Be smart.
[213:44.17]Summon more guys?
[213:49.29]I don't need to do that.
[213:50.79]Just wait, the original ones are going to come back any minute now.
[214:00.38]There you go.
[214:00.68]Alright, again.
[214:01.98]Almost there.
[214:06.57]Why are you hitting me?
[214:08.67]Don't worry, it's part of my calculations.
[214:17.51]Shit!
[214:18.23]And my pants, come on.
[214:19.43]Alright, what is he at now?
[214:28.84]I gotta check.
[214:32.58]Holy halberd, grant me strength!
[214:44.66]Let me see.
[214:45.06]Spare?
[214:45.50]You're at 76%.
[214:46.06]Alright, let's do that one more time.
[214:48.02]Play smart.
[214:50.04]You encourage Noelle to use her mind.
[214:52.78]Acted smart.
[214:53.47]Partake, Chris, the zephyr of punishment.
[215:03.91]See that?
[215:05.39]92%.
[215:05.41]Alright, I just have to do that one more time.
[215:07.11]So I'm going to heal and she's going to...
[215:09.99]Seedy Bagel myself.
[215:12.13]And then have her do her thing.
[215:13.69]And action standard.
[215:14.89]Now we should be at 100% time to, uh, to pacify.
[215:17.79]Oh, don't even need to.
[215:27.54]Dammit.
[215:27.90]Hurtley, are you okay?
[215:30.58]Chris, maybe we should have gone easier on him.
[215:33.00]Oh, easier?
[215:35.45]The only one going easy mode was me.
[215:38.39]If you would just listen...
[216:06.44]After defeating Birdly, a certain scent hangs in the air.
[216:09.30]You're filled with the power of chicken nuggets.
[216:10.80]What?
[216:13.20]He smells like chicken nuggets?
[216:16.24]Now I want that.
[216:19.01]Now that's what I want.
[216:20.81]Hmm.
[216:22.27]Interesting.
[216:26.31]Alright.
[216:27.29]Are they all gonna move or... I'm kind of concerned about this.
[216:30.21]No.
[216:30.31]We're good.
[216:33.18]Well, honey, where are you?
[216:36.01]Oh, no, here she comes.
[216:39.15]Oh, Chris, perfect timing.
[216:48.16]Have you seen?
[216:49.02]Oh, my luxurious queen.
[216:53.44]Oh, my circuits, Chris, get in the car.
[217:01.33]My queen, where are you?
[217:03.75]I've baked you a gamer's delight.
[217:06.54]She's not here.
[217:07.20]Gamer's delight.
[217:12.30]That was close.
[217:14.96]Chris, who is your friend?
[217:18.27]My face recognition software does not compute them.
[217:23.27]And yet, something about them seems... Cool.
[217:29.47]Robotic, even.
[217:33.19]Chris, we must drive to find Noelle.
[217:36.09]Everyone, get in the car.
[217:41.23]Chris, press directional buttons to steer.
[217:44.11]Chris, don't hit the cars.
[217:50.06]So much traffic.
[217:50.86]Isn't it wonderful?
[217:52.44]Lightners love traffic.
[217:53.68]They look it up all the time.
[217:55.14]Poor Noelle.
[217:55.74]I can't look.
[217:56.18]I can't read that.
[218:01.90]Stop everything.
[218:03.30]First, get the banana.
[218:06.74]Why?
[218:07.77]Potassium.
[218:12.51]Stop everything.
[218:13.95]Here comes a crossing to get ready to stop.
[218:17.73]Can I?
[218:20.03]Oh, my circuits, it's a traffic jam.
[218:22.87]A dog must have wandered in the road again.
[218:24.59]Crispy a deer and go press the walk button.
[218:28.33]It's just over on the other side of the road.
[218:38.91]Um, I'll go too.
[218:41.07]No!
[218:42.31]You must stay.
[218:44.55]Hmm?
[218:45.95]Until you hear all of my mixtape.
[218:49.57]Oh, okay.
[218:51.23]Chris, hurry up, please.
[218:56.62]Next up is my CD of vintage hard disk noises.
[219:00.20]Chris, please hurry.
[219:05.38]By Queen Clean, the most popular cleaning flavors.
[219:10.18]Clean, clean, made of 100% acid.
[219:19.20]Hey, every, it's me.
[219:23.48]Everybody's favorite number one rated salesman, 1997.
[219:26.89]Spam, spam, spam, spam.
[219:34.57]Whoa.

[219:38.51]Lightner!

[219:41.09]Looks like you're all alone on a late night!
[219:43.75]All your friends abandoned you for the slime!
[219:47.44]You are?
[219:48.54]Tails!

[220:03.13]If you've lost control of your life!
[220:05.31]Then you just gotta grab it by the silly strings.
[220:09.05]Why be the little sponge who hates a tough one in a nine life when you can be a big shot?
[220:15.29]Big shot.
[220:16.27]A big shot.
[220:17.75]That's right.
[220:18.65]Now's your chance to be a big shot.
[220:21.39]And I have just the thing you need.
[220:26.17]That's hyperlink block.
[220:32.86]You want it?
[220:33.36]You want it?
[220:34.56]Blocked.
[220:35.32]No, you want it?
[220:36.24]Well, I have.
[220:36.70]I got a deal for you.
[220:38.51]All you have to do is show me your heart-shaped object.
[220:42.99]You're a lightener.
[220:44.37]You're a lightener?
[220:45.87]You've got the light.
[220:46.93]Why don't you... Don't you want to be a big shot?
[220:48.83]Okay.
[220:48.97]Check.
[221:02.61]Spamton.
[221:03.51]He wants to make a deal, but don't give him your money.
[221:21.62]There's nothing wrong with having a nice splurge every once in a while.
[221:25.12]Okay.
[221:27.82]Spamton.
[221:29.48]Don't make a deal.
[221:39.26]Deal.
[221:39.54]Hey, hey, hey, I've never seen a heart-shaped object like that before.
[221:43.86]My eyes are burning like DVDs of any movie at that price.
[221:47.56]I have a very special deal for you, kid.
[221:50.93]Tell me more.
[221:54.37]Not interested.
[221:56.43]Wrong answer.
[221:57.21]Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[221:58.25]Try again.
[221:59.37]Meet local singles straight from my...
[222:10.28]Easy!

[222:36.21]So what do I do here?
[222:37.33]Act?
[222:38.49]What does it say?
[222:39.17]Congratulations, you are the 100th visitor.
[222:40.97]Click here to die.
[222:43.03]Okay, let's make a deal.
[222:47.89]Kid in business, you need to say you're interested.
[222:49.83]Alright, tell me more.
[222:52.15]That's the attitude, you little slime.
[222:55.17]Deals like this only come once in your ant size rapidly shrinking life.
[222:59.94]Get big and win.
[223:10.68]Okay.
[223:11.32]Spanton flashes an award-losing smile.
[223:17.04]Heal?
[223:17.52]Deal?
[223:20.06]What?
[223:22.14]Oh, I can heal.
[223:23.66]Can I do deal again?
[223:24.68]Deal.
[223:25.80]Believe it or I used to be a big shot.
[223:28.92]The biggest shot.
[223:29.72]But now I need a little generosity.
[223:32.64]It didn't say don't give him money?
[223:40.05]It said, don't give him money.
[223:43.78]That's right.
[223:44.38]And I don't mean money.
[223:46.52]I'm a salesman.
[223:47.18]I was never in it for the money.
[223:49.28]Enlarge yourself.
[223:50.98]Okay.
[223:51.42]And I was like, what was he at?
[224:03.11]40%?
[224:03.17]Alright.
[224:05.28]Deal.
[224:07.55]I was only ever in it for the freedom.
[224:12.05]Make your own deals to call your own shots.
[224:15.01]And sometimes in the morning, a little hyperlink blocked.
[224:18.93]Yeah, down's good, doesn't it, kid?
[224:21.21]Don't you want to be just like your old pal, Spamford?
[224:24.05]Take the deal.
[224:28.23]Take the deal?
[224:31.14]I don't think, I don't think, no, I'm going to take the deal.
[224:33.86]Take the deal.
[224:35.80]Now that's what I'm talking about.
[224:36.98]You got guts, kid.
[224:38.42]That's discomfort and abdominal pain in my guts.
[224:42.56]And we can win wild prizes.
[224:44.46]Oof.
[224:44.98]Alright, I gotta... What is he at?
[224:48.56]60%.
[224:48.62]I gotta heal.
[224:51.74]If I heal deal, I heal 60.
[224:53.80]Deal and heal 60.
[224:55.01]Let's do it.
[225:05.17]Don't worry, kid, I will give you deal insurance.
[225:07.53]Only for low, low price of a thousand kromer.
[225:10.47]An awesome price, an absolutely terrifying price.
[225:13.17]It's just so low, everyone I know is dead.
[225:19.13]I'm not going to buy the insurance.
[225:21.91]What?
[225:22.67]You don't have enough wacky stats.
[225:24.72]Kid, you're killing me.
[225:27.36]Please stop killing me.
[225:28.36]I will give you another deal.
[225:29.90]Press F1 for help.
[225:30.72]Did I?
[225:46.65]What?
[225:50.17]Alright, he's at 80%.
[225:51.42]Alright, deal.
[225:54.44]Don't worry, kids.
[225:55.40]I'm an honest man.
[225:58.16]I just need your account details and the number on the back of the card and you can enjoy a thousand feet over.
[226:07.34]I refuse.
[226:08.78]What?
[226:09.22]You don't need it?
[226:10.28]That's a real big shot move, kid.
[226:13.76]You're like me.
[226:15.45]Yes.
[226:17.08]We know what we want, don't we?
[226:20.04]Wild prizes, hot single, 100 customer and most of all... Will you take the final deal?
[226:30.37]Remember, this is up to you.
[226:31.55]I won't force you.
[226:32.37]I'll take the deal.
[226:45.66]And a deal's a deal.
[226:47.32]Pleasure doing business with you, kid.
[226:51.63]Oh, he took $24.
[226:52.09]Now on to the next step.
[227:02.55]I'll be waiting at my homemade storefront site.
[227:05.75]In the trash area, closed for repairs.
[227:08.61]Come alone.
[227:10.38]And don't forget to like and subscribe for...
[227:20.62]He's in the trash house.
[227:21.76]Yeah.
[227:25.64]He's in the trash house.
[227:26.86]We gotta go to the trash house now, don't we?
[227:32.59]It's a dumpster.
[227:33.13]Looks like there's a pillow inside.
[227:40.23]The poster is torn, revealing a faded one underneath.
[227:43.33]Big shot autos take a ride around town in our special... The rest is cut off.
[227:51.73]Cool.
[227:53.11]Should I go there now?
[227:54.15]I'm assuming I'll get access to like the actual hub world again, right?
[228:01.16]I loved that guy.
[228:01.88]That guy was awesome.
[228:04.24]Oh, right.
[228:04.60]I forgot about this.
[228:19.01]First we have to drive to find Noelle.
[228:21.41]Turn on the high beams.
[228:25.01]When she sees the queen's signal, she will come running.
[228:29.70]Why does he need to find Noelle so badly?
[228:34.50]What are you saying?
[228:35.14]This city is dangerous.
[228:36.90]Imagine poor Noelle clipping into a wall somewhere.
[228:42.57]Wasting away from potassium deficiency.
[228:46.75]You're actually worried about her?
[228:49.61]It would be if I wasn't going to find her.
[228:54.71]But why her?
[228:55.99]Wait, let me guess.
[228:57.85]Is it because she's weak enough to make it and you can make me make the person into a peon?
[229:04.68]No.
[229:06.14]Just the opposite.
[229:07.78]It's because she's strong.
[229:11.34]What?
[229:11.82]Huh?
[229:13.40]Chris, stop the car.
[229:17.16]What's wrong with it?
[229:20.36]Phew!
[229:21.14]I was just concerned because it hadn't exploded yet.
[229:26.59]Looks like we'll have to split up on foot.
[229:31.17]She's such a weirdo.
[229:34.19]Chris, if you see Noelle, tell her my knowledge of her preferences is absolute.
[229:39.57]And if she needs proof, use this.
[229:42.71]Queen's mixtape was thrown into your key items.
[229:46.13]Toodles!
[229:54.37]somehow I feel like we're almost out of here let's go Chris check on lancer hey thanks for the tape I was hungry push my tummy to hear a cool song that's it
[230:33.75]Nice.
[230:38.57]Gosh, that was close, wasn't it, Chris?
[230:40.81]This strange world, this big city, it's so wild, it kind of makes my head spin.
[230:47.17]Ugh.
[230:48.21]Looks like another puzzle.
[230:50.17]Maybe if I go down here... Okay.
[230:54.23]D. D. E. E.
[231:05.02]D.E.
[231:09.52]When I said the city makes my head spin, I didn't mean it in a bad way, you know?
[231:14.25]I just wanted to go someplace new, you know?
[231:17.73]D.E.C.
[231:18.55]and Des always told me she'd take me.
[231:21.95]Somewhere like this.
[231:24.01]Somewhere with shining lights.
[231:26.83]D.E.C.
[231:30.48]B?
[231:32.55]C?
[231:33.59]Why don't you miss exploring, Chris?
[231:35.35]Back when the four of us were kids.
[231:37.47]Gosh, remember that night we explored the forest behind the graveyard?
[231:48.32]December?
[231:50.16]I know we never found anything interesting back there.
[231:51.96]I mostly remember crying because I was scared.
[232:01.81]Yeah, December.
[232:08.45]For some reason, I feel nostalgic thinking about it.
[232:12.03]Yes.
[232:13.39]Yes, wiping away my tears with a warm sleeves that smell like cinnamon.
[232:17.85]I guess I didn't mind being scared if it meant someone would comfort me.
[232:22.71]December.
[232:23.07]Ah.
[232:32.28]Chris is the only one who knows how weird I am.
[232:35.39]It's not fair, you know.
[232:37.21]Everyone knows how weird you are.
[232:38.85]December.
[232:45.71]We got deals.
[232:46.27]It's a ball throwing game.
[232:51.84]Prizes are seated under the counter.
[232:56.48]Ball throwing game.
[232:57.22]Prizes are seated under the counter.
[233:00.37]Ball throwing game, prizes are seated under the counter.
[233:02.29]Right.
[233:03.27]A lot of ball throwing games.
[233:05.65]Does this matter?
[233:06.19]Does the placement of this stuff matter?
[233:09.27]I feel like it does.
[233:10.85]Why?
[233:15.24]Oh no, she's coming back.
[233:17.42]I'll hide in that stall.
[233:24.36]Hey, check this out.
[233:31.23]Sweet, right?
[233:34.13]Where's my prize?
[233:36.31]Oh, um... Here.
[233:41.09]Nice.
[233:41.37]Wait, I actually don't want this.
[233:48.46]Nobody does.
[233:52.50]How was that?
[233:55.02]Susie, you're not supposed to attack people with it.
[233:59.02]Oh yeah, watch me.
[234:02.71]Chris, there you are.
[234:04.45]Chris, check out my new attack.
[234:08.93]+2 healing.
[234:10.49]You felt slightly healed.
[234:12.63]How's that?
[234:13.17]Meet the new healing master, Chris.
[234:16.45]Oh, yes, she is a real master at it, Chris.
[234:20.51]Oh, teaching you sarcasm was a mistake.
[234:26.27]Oh, Chris, what's that you have there?
[234:28.13]Is that a gift for someone?
[234:32.88]Birdly.
[234:34.96]Give to Noelle, give to Rousey, give to Susie, give to Birdly.
[234:39.34]Who do I want to give this to?
[234:41.63]I think I want to give this to Birdly.
[234:46.17]Chris, have you seen?
[234:47.03]Chris, we took a break from trucing for one second and you're already back with Susie?
[234:57.68]Should have expected this.
[234:58.64]You couldn't keep up with my puzzle-solving skills.
[235:04.92]Here.
[235:06.28]Uh-huh.
[235:10.30]A plush of... Me?
[235:13.98]With nipples.
[235:17.74]I guess I'll forgive you for now.
[235:19.40]See you, Chris.
[235:22.93]Huh.
[235:24.23]Alright.
[235:24.91]Why the hell did you give it to Birdly?
[235:25.91]Why did you give it to Birdly?
[235:26.77]What unexpected kindness?
[235:29.83]Let's just get the hell out of here.
[235:33.06]Wait!
[235:34.44]Noelle?
[235:34.86]What the hell were you doing in there?
[235:40.36]That's cheating.
[235:43.68]I, um, um, um... Hmm, glad you're okay, though.
[235:47.40]Since that stupid queen took you, I was kind of worried.
[235:53.33]Yeah, I don't... Thump, thump.
[235:55.33]That's the foot tap.
[235:57.09]Wait, aren't you on their side?
[235:59.03]Huh?
[236:00.81]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[236:03.29]Uh, I... I... Chris, help me.
[236:07.97]She is our enemy.
[236:10.63]Now, we have a truce.
[236:12.63]That's right, we have a truce.
[236:14.17]Chris said I could be on your team.
[236:15.93]Oh, really?
[236:17.50]Really?
[236:19.34]Well, if Chris said so, I guess.
[236:20.80]Didn't really want to kill you anyway.
[236:27.17]So, get in line already.
[236:30.63]Okay.
[236:34.11]Chris also said I should be behind Susie.
[236:38.32]Well, Chris said so.
[236:40.30]Let's go already.
[236:42.98]Guess I'll join too, but only for this room.
[236:50.60]Yeah!
[236:52.62]Our party is complete.
[236:57.42]That's funny.
[237:02.88]Oh, save point.
[237:04.20]Um, I should probably go pee.
[237:08.59]Yeah, let's go.
[237:09.33]Alright, let me take a break.
[237:11.11]I'm gonna get some water and we'll take a quick BRB.
[237:14.13]I'll be back in like two or three minutes.
[241:21.16]Hello?
[241:21.50]Hi.
[241:22.66]Uh, I'm back.
[241:23.78]But I am crunching on some almonds.
[241:27.05]Good gamer snack.
[241:28.85]So give me one second.
[242:15.60]I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that just like roasted almonds, like salted roasted almonds.
[242:22.21]That's the best gamer snack.
[242:24.03]It's quick.
[242:25.09]You don't need to eat very many of them.
[242:28.91]Peanuts too, but especially almonds.
[242:31.49]They're calorie dense.
[242:33.00]They're nutrient dense.
[242:36.28]Very crunchy.
[242:37.14]They're very crunchy, as you can tell.
[242:38.62]That was Larry.
[242:42.60]I was just doing Larry David.
[242:45.51]Very crunchy, very crunchy.
[242:48.99]Alright, let's go.
[242:59.94]Yeah, monkey mode engaged.
[243:09.73]I should go up.
[243:10.13]Alright.
[243:13.03]Status report update.
[243:16.82]Those of you that have played this, how many more hours from now until I've received the completion of Chapter 2's completion?
[243:26.16]Okay.
[243:32.42]About two to three hours?
[243:33.96]At this pace, about three or four hours?
[243:35.63]Okay.
[243:36.79]Okay.
[243:38.41]Okay.
[243:39.23]You're exactly halfway through.
[243:40.81]Really?
[243:44.85]About two or three.
[243:45.59]Okay.
[243:51.67]Okay.
[243:52.51]So, here's what's probably going to happen.
[243:58.04]We're going to go for a little longer.
[243:59.12]Probably like another hour, I'd say.
[244:04.76]And then tomorrow, we're going to open with this.
[244:08.32]I'm going to complete it.
[244:09.56]And then we'll move on to the umbrella game.
[244:12.96]I don't want to blow through this.
[244:17.90]You know what I mean?
[244:18.46]I don't want to just like do a seven hour stream and like eight hour stream and blow through this and just forget it tomorrow.
[244:26.18]You also have to do the secret boss.
[244:27.64]I'll try.
[244:28.00]Alright.
[244:31.83]So we'll go for like another hour.
[244:33.11]Let's go.
[244:33.37]Do I take the stairs or the teacups?
[244:41.39]What's the point of that?
[244:55.04]Um... Wait, I know!
[245:01.83]Um, to turn up that force field... You just stay standing on this switch!
[245:07.87]Huh.
[245:10.83]Well, see you later.
[245:12.32]Wait, what?
[245:15.10]Okay.
[245:23.43]The treasure of air, where three are one, place one to three.
[245:27.01]Perhaps it means we all have to enter one teacup?
[245:33.05]I don't like doing it, but it works.
[245:34.16]Okay.
[245:35.04]You're eating a tuna melt?
[245:50.06]I wish for a split second.
[245:52.85]And I mean like one full second.
[245:55.37]I could snap my fingers and just be you for one second.
[245:59.33]Right when you take a bite.
[246:00.87]Like you bite down.
[246:02.41]I'm you.
[246:03.77]Now I'm not you.
[246:04.23]You know what I mean?
[246:05.37]God.
[246:05.61]I just want to be you for one second.
[246:08.83]Because I want to eat that delicious fucking tuna milk.
[246:10.79]Okay.
[246:17.82]Okay.
[246:22.26]You want to possess somebody?
[246:23.32]No.
[246:24.76]Wait, what happened?
[246:25.34]Did it work?
[246:29.46]Why are you so high?
[246:30.66]What are you talking about?
[246:32.10]Hold on.
[246:37.94]Do we have tuna haters in the chat right here?
[246:41.70]A tuna fish sandwich.
[246:45.82]We don't, right?
[246:49.92]Nothing in here.
[246:55.39]All for nothing.
[246:57.27]Tuna's good.
[247:01.25]Just don't take too long, okay?
[247:02.81]Wait.
[247:06.99]Dreamer, silence.
[247:10.37]Tuna's amazing.
[247:15.03]Well, let me rephrase that.
[247:16.35]I like Tuna.
[247:18.41]Hold on.
[247:18.95]Sorry.
[247:19.63]Let me redo that.
[247:21.42]I like Tuna.
[247:24.06]But it has to be cooked all the way through.
[247:28.48]I'm talking tuna from the can.
[247:29.38]Let me show you my ultimate healing move.
[247:37.80]Get hit.
[247:39.25]Avoid.
[247:39.65]Susie told you to avoid getting hit by the ambulances.
[248:01.25]It smells like isopropyl.
[248:03.21]Isopropyl alcohol.
[248:09.74]It is amazing from the can.
[248:12.46]Yeah, that's how I like it like that.
[248:14.16]You take it out of the can.
[248:15.76]Mush it up with a fork.
[248:16.64]You get it to... I don't know, this might sound gross, but it's not.
[248:20.67]You get it to a paste consistency.
[248:23.71]Slightly chunky.
[248:24.63]Don't go too crazy.
[248:25.59]So it's not like baby puke.
[248:27.51]You know what I mean?
[248:35.81]Cat food.
[248:36.57]Yeah, what's, okay, sure.
[248:41.17]So, um, why are you all riding a teacup together?
[248:51.08]Nuclear Bunker Andy.
[248:54.80]No, you have no idea.
[248:56.20]Going to school, opening up my lunch, and I had a tuna sandwich in there.
[249:03.47]That was a big deal.
[249:07.28]It's like, wait, mom, what's in there?
[249:09.40]What's the sandwich?
[249:10.92]Usually it would be just like bologna and American cheese, right?
[249:14.06]Oh man, what if it was tuna fish we were eating that day?
[249:18.16]It was amazing if that was in there.
[249:25.71]I would eat it so fast.
[249:31.61]Too fast.
[249:33.29]We were eating fast that day.
[249:44.39]Wait, where'd they all go?
[249:46.21]Oh, wait, didn't the hacker do this?
[249:48.06]You're being invaded.
[249:51.12]Wait, I don't want to pop the balloons.
[249:55.78]No, I want to keep the balloons.
[249:58.66]Oh, no.
[250:00.06]Jeez.
[250:14.72]Alright, can I get all three of them?
[250:18.32]Uh, we'll do that.
[250:28.07]Ah.
[250:28.17]Alright, I'm being pushed around.
[250:36.59]Okay.
[250:42.73]Spare... Well, no, let's actually act.
[250:46.94]Scrap all.
[250:49.36]Spare.
[250:49.80]Shit!
[250:52.98]Alright, I got two.
[250:53.42]Gamble time.
[250:58.14]I'm doing a scratch off ticket.
[250:59.20]If I win money, I'll gift subs.
[251:00.38]Let's bet how much I'll win.
[251:01.68]If you get it right, you get 30% of when I win.
[251:05.35]Here's what's gonna happen.
[251:08.53]You are going to scratch off.
[251:10.43]Let's say that there's eight slots.
[251:13.07]Eight slots, right?
[251:15.27]You're going to win on every single one of them.
[251:17.67]You're going to win on all eight.
[251:19.16]You're going to match eight of your numbers.
[251:20.54]You're going to be freaking out.
[251:22.82]And you're going to go to the bottom to see what you won.
[251:24.95]And it's going to be $2 for each slot.
[251:29.87]That's the worst.
[251:32.13]But you know, this time, this time, here's what I want to hope happens.
[251:35.57]I hope this time you get one just instant win.
[251:39.75]You don't have to match any numbers or anything.
[251:40.91]You don't have to match.
[251:43.17]And it's like $100,000.
[251:43.71]I hope that happens to you.
[251:47.08]And I don't want you to give me any of it.
[251:52.70]Joel's in the chat.
[251:54.86]What's up, Joel?
[251:57.02]What's going on?
[251:59.06]You don't have to, like... He's just watching.
[252:01.92]He's just hanging out.
[252:08.79]Hey, I hope you win $100,000.
[252:10.33]Do I like the game?
[252:10.89]Yeah.
[252:11.71]I think it's really good.
[252:14.28]It's really fun.
[252:14.80]Really funny.
[252:15.16]How the fuck are you doing?
[252:18.46]I'm going to hang out sometime.
[252:23.31]We still have, like, the first part of the second half of the tutorial in Halo Infinite.
[252:29.81]So... I mean, if you're around.
[252:45.75]I don't like this.
[252:46.37]Spiders and Finding Isaac are the worst.
[252:57.55]There we go.
[253:01.73]Hey!
[253:02.99]Susie!
[253:03.19]What the hell are you blaming me for?
[253:05.39]You made the trap.
[253:06.47]What?
[253:14.59]Oh, it tricked me.
[253:16.11]I don't like this one.
[253:16.75]I'm very hard at this one.
[253:25.76]She ate the cheese?
[253:28.61]Is this the time that you played Halo on impossible difficulty and hated it?
[253:31.75]Yes.
[253:34.67]The only time I've ever played Halo in my life.
[253:37.59]We played it on impossible.
[253:39.57]And we didn't even make it out of the tutorial.
[253:42.21]And I never played it again.
[253:43.31]And I hate the series.
[253:44.21]That's so fucked up.
[253:48.48]Oh, wait a second.
[253:48.90]Where's Noelle?
[253:51.78]Sorry, I just never seen fireworks up close before.
[253:56.16]Fuck you for that?
[253:57.60]What?
[253:59.46]Those bullets, what, you scared?
[254:00.88]Uh, um, I guess so.
[254:03.48]Maybe that's why I couldn't stop watching.
[254:08.98]Fuck you for doing that.
[254:17.47]Zero.
[254:19.01]To catch mice?
[254:19.49]Okay.
[254:24.81]So, how do we...
[254:26.75]You put the mice in the hole.
[254:29.99]Ah, okay.
[254:30.49]I get it.
[254:34.09]Wait, I need a mouse?
[254:39.52]Where do I get a mouse?
[254:42.22]Oh, okay.
[254:42.58]You have to let him go.
[254:43.30]Okay.
[254:48.78]What do I think about the final Smash DLC fighter?
[254:53.75]I don't even know who it is.
[254:56.80]I don't think they even announced it yet.
[254:58.52]Are they announcing it next week?
[255:04.96]20 more?
[255:07.66]Maybe if we split up the world.
[255:08.84]I wonder who it's going to be, honestly.
[255:11.14]Because... This is the last Smash character ever, right?
[255:18.13]I don't know.
[255:18.67]Are they going to make another Smash Brothers?
[255:20.39]They kind of can't.
[255:23.65]If they make another Smash Bros., who are they going to add for characters?
[255:26.77]Like Mr. Clean?
[255:28.64]How are they going to do this again?
[255:33.50]Make a prediction?
[255:34.48]I'm going to make a prediction.
[255:36.80]Unless they start adding cereal mascots, there's no way there's going to be another Smash Bros.
[255:44.71]I'm going to say because, okay, they're either going to do one of two things.
[255:48.49]The first thing they're going to do is they're going to do some incredibly iconic video game character that is not there yet.
[255:55.83]Like, I don't know, like the Doom guy, right?
[256:00.58]I saw that floating around before and that would make a little bit sense.
[256:06.08]Like, oh, Doom, like gaming history, right?
[256:10.18]But what they probably are going to do, it's probably going to be Crash Bandicoot.
[256:15.01]Because that would be the ultimate Nintendo, Microsoft collaboration between every third party.
[256:23.35]It's probably going to be Crash Bandicoot.
[256:25.33]It probably will.
[256:26.01]It's like PlayStation, Sony, SEGA, Microsoft.
[256:34.32]I'll tell you.
[256:34.70]Alright.
[256:35.74]Here's a prediction I'll make that will make me really upset.
[256:39.12]It better not be a Fire Emblem character.
[256:41.76]Right?
[256:43.62]You can't do that for the final character.
[256:46.94]If it wasn't going to be Crash Bandicoot or... I don't know.
[256:54.24]Shinkaro Miyamoto?
[256:55.84]Can I say... I don't know.
[256:59.69]That would be actually... That could happen.
[257:05.91]It's not going to be Waluigi, no.
[257:07.29]Unless it's... What is it?
[257:08.05]April 1st?
[257:19.74]Hope they put Mario in.
[257:22.12]Phoenix Wright?
[257:22.94]I don't know if Phoenix Wright's gonna be the last character.
[257:31.86]I'm trying to think of anybody else that I think would actually be in the final slot.
[257:39.15]I know, I know, play the game, play the game.
[257:40.37]I know, give me one more second.
[257:41.39]Crash Bandicoot, Doomguy, Shigeru Miyamoto, or I'll give you one, like, the top four.
[257:49.37]Um... I don't fucking... Ronald McDonald?
[257:56.33]I don't know.
[257:58.05]That'd be awesome.
[258:00.78]Okay, let me ask you.
[258:02.60]Would you be upset if Ronald McDonald was the last character?
[258:06.98]No, you'd be so happy.
[258:12.83]Everybody would go crazy.
[258:19.39]I've said this before, but I'll tell you where they really messed up is not putting Scrooge McDuck in the game, because that was a classic Nintendo game.
[258:24.51]He has a moveset that makes perfect sense.
[258:26.61]He's got the pogo, he's got the gems, he's got the golf swing.
[258:29.79]It was a mistake to not put him in there, and you already have Disney bullshit in the game with the... Wait, do they have Disney bullshit in the game?
[258:40.92]Is there Disney bullshit in the game?
[258:43.73]Fuck, it's going to be Sora.
[258:45.85]No, it's not.
[258:46.51]Nobody cares about Kingdom Hearts right now.
[258:47.99]That should have been like a year ago.
[258:49.10]No, it's not going to be Sora.
[258:57.00]No.
[258:57.58]Okay, I would have agreed with Sora if this was like 2019.
[259:00.30]Or like early 2020.
[259:02.56]Nope.
[259:04.48]Too late.
[259:06.92]Rayman would be cool.
[259:08.35]Alright, I'll release the mice.
[259:09.29]Susie will break the balloons when they reach the top.
[259:15.06]Chrono from Chrono Trigger?
[259:16.12]No.
[259:17.55]Oh, they don't give a shit about that franchise.
[259:23.13]Susie will break the balloons when they reach the top.
[259:25.33]And Chris, you catch them.
[259:26.93]Okay.
[259:30.02]They picked the characters in November 2019.
[259:32.26]Oh, that's, you know, that's right.
[259:34.70]That's actually correct.
[259:35.92]It really might be Sora.
[259:37.80]But don't you think you would do that not as the last character?
[259:44.53]Alright, hold on.
[259:46.05]Because, honestly, if you had... Okay, the final character of the DLC should be Banjo-Kazooie.
[259:53.02]Right?
[259:53.24]Unless you got somebody better than that.
[259:56.18]Think about it.
[259:58.70]Who have they put in the game so far that has, like, a huge impact on all of video games?
[260:04.00]I'm very bad at this.
[260:06.56]I'm saying, like, who could it possibly be that's more ridiculous than Banjo?
[260:15.89]Minecraft Steve?
[260:16.73]Yeah.
[260:18.25]But then who would the final person be?
[260:19.91]It's not going to be Sora.
[260:23.95]If it was going to be Sora, Sora would have been announced where Banjo was announced, and Banjo would be the last character.
[260:28.72]You see what I'm saying?
[260:30.88]Because Kingdom Hearts 3 was relevant back then, not now.
[260:38.34]Master Chief?
[260:39.04]I don't know about that.
[260:41.39]Hell yeah, take that, you stupid mice.
[260:47.69]I'm seeing you enjoy puzzles, Susie.
[260:50.82]They aren't awful if you do them like that.
[260:53.56]Not bad, Noelle.
[260:54.22]That was kind of smart.
[260:55.08]Is it going to be a Tetris block?
[261:01.90]Yeah.
[261:03.18]I mean, nobody really thought that Piranha Plant was going to be in the game, but that kind of just came out of nowhere.
[261:13.51]Can I?
[261:13.85]Okay, I gotta pay attention to the game, but you have my thoughts.
[261:17.05]Crash Bandicoot, Doomguy, Shigeru Miyamoto, a regular Nintendo NES where the controllers are your arms, and, like, two NES light guns are your legs, is also, I don't know, maybe a possibility?
[261:36.74]I need one.
[261:41.40]Oh.
[261:48.63]He's so high.
[261:49.65]Ooh.
[261:54.39]Look, we're finally close to the fountain.
[261:56.63]It's Queen's Mansion.
[261:59.48]What?
[262:00.28]Why did we come here?
[262:04.56]Chris, you brought Noelle right to me.
[262:06.68]I knew our truce was the best.
[262:09.92]But unfortunately, that means truces are over.
[262:13.22]Noelle, get over here.
[262:16.44]But I, Noelle, I will only say it one time, infinitely.
[262:23.30]Get over here, get over here, get over here, get over here, get over here, get over here.
[262:27.44]I, Noelle, are you hesitating?
[262:30.81]Let me if then this for you.
[262:34.15]How about if you don't listen, then a certain bird might take a ride in the acid river.
[262:40.75]Birdly?
[262:45.25]That's right, he was just with us.
[262:47.29]We must have captured him and we weren't looking.
[262:54.78]I'm sorry.
[262:55.32]Chris, Susie, I... I wish I could have stayed with you longer.
[262:58.80]I can't let Birdly get hurt, you know?
[263:05.53]Don't be sad, Noelle, honey.
[263:07.99]All that remains is the final step.
[263:12.03]A splendorous queen, there you are.
[263:14.97]Sorry, I thought I saw you in a used game store and... Oh, Noel!
[263:20.37]Are you okay?
[263:21.27]You look a little funny.
[263:27.13]Okay, plan B. Captured.
[263:31.35]Huh?
[263:33.17]What are you doing?
[263:35.25]I see now her will must be unleashed by force.
[263:38.77]Perhaps if I make her face into a robot one...
[263:43.56]You said you wouldn't do that if I... Variable lying set to true.
[263:49.58]We were going to be smart together.
[263:51.18]That's not fair.
[263:53.40]Understood.
[263:54.74]Fairness activated.
[263:55.70]Hey!
[264:00.04]Good thing I calibrated those cages.
[264:03.64]You said I could trust you.
[264:05.91]How do you know, how do I know I can trust you?
[264:07.75]You said you were a gamer!
[264:10.96]Birdly, I only play mobile games.
[264:15.22]No!
[264:17.04]One of you is going to help me with my plan.
[264:19.90]And it's going to be no help.
[264:23.16]The rest of you, go to your rooms.
[264:25.18]I only play mobile games.
[264:29.02]Not a real gamer.
[264:32.68]What are you going to do with me?
[264:36.31]Damn.
[264:37.55]You're still here.
[264:39.25]I only made four cages.
[264:40.53]I literally don't know.
[264:43.01]How do you like your new room units?
[264:52.80]As you can see, they are perfectly suited to your interests, which I gleaned from your internet search results.
[264:59.34]I estimate you will have no desire to leave.
[265:02.34]Please tantalize yourself with your surroundings.
[265:05.34]And wait patiently while I dominate the world.
[265:08.58]Toodles!
[265:12.93]Chris, hey, can you hear me?
[265:16.65]Looks like there's some way to communicate between rooms.
[265:19.93]Convenient, isn't it?
[265:20.77]I really thought of everything.
[265:22.73]Shut up!
[265:23.87]Anyway, let's think of some way to get out of here.
[265:26.86]Rousey, you got any bright ideas?
[265:31.14]Uh, hey, where the hell's Rousey?
[265:35.19]Damn, that's soft yet tender screaming.
[265:37.75]Chris, that's got to be him.
[265:39.67]Quick, we've got to think of some way to get out.
[265:41.21]Anything you smuggled in that might help us?
[265:54.51]Lancer?
[265:58.05]Should I take the Lancer cookie?
[266:00.33]Maybe he'll come out and help.
[266:04.41]Oh, it's me, Lancer!
[266:05.57]Release me, and I will release you!
[266:11.31]Missed me?
[266:12.77]Because I missed you?
[266:15.47]Lancer!
[266:15.83]Is that you?
[266:16.69]I thought you ditched us.
[266:18.73]No, I love ditches, but I would never ditch you.
[266:21.73]I was simply relaxing in Chris's spacious pants hole.
[266:26.30]Oh, a pocket.
[266:27.76]Yes, and I saw it all.
[266:30.48]Pants, lint, various items.
[266:32.97]A wild mom puts you in some shock cages.
[266:37.87]Uh, yeah, we're trapped, so, uh... Hey, wait, did you see us on the roller coaster?
[266:43.69]Yes, it was amazing.
[266:44.77]My first coaster ride ever.
[266:46.53]Ha, I love getting nauseous with friends.
[266:51.37]Hey, you should probably, uh, free us.
[266:55.09]Oh, right, yes.
[266:56.59]You can always rely on friendly me.
[266:59.89]I almost just swallowed, I almost just choked on my own saliva.
[267:02.96]To make you free.
[267:07.27]I have no idea how to use this.
[267:10.05]Request new item for room.
[267:11.85]That sounds good.
[267:13.47]Item request traveled.
[267:15.35]Modity, let's say, 999.
[267:19.39]Modity overload.
[267:21.43]Oh, it worked.
[267:23.77]Let's go.
[267:24.27]Blue person whose name I know.
[267:31.50]Jelly in the shape of various knives.
[267:33.64]From search query sharpest kitchen knife jaw.

[268:01.97]From search video game piano tutorial.
[268:04.20]Get out of here.
[268:07.86]It's a VHS explaining how to install video game piano.
[268:11.94]From search query video game piano tutorial.
[268:19.16]Use the communication device?
[268:20.60]Yes.
[268:21.64]You put your whole head inside and honked.
[268:24.80]Chris, what the hell are you doing?
[268:26.40]Trying to put your head... Okay, yeah, me too.
[268:28.18]Hey, we don't have time for this.
[268:31.72]It's dozens and dozens of bath bombs from search query DIY bath bomb.
[268:40.03]Alright, let's go.
[268:44.39]Chris, hey.
[268:45.57]Man, Lancer, you're the best.
[268:46.80]Come on, Noel and Rousey are waiting.
[268:50.82]Yes.
[268:53.38]Let's put the pedal on the pedal.
[268:56.20]Yes.
[269:00.47]What?
[269:01.85]Hey, Lancer, are you okay?
[269:04.15]I'm fine.
[269:04.65]I'm just very cold.
[269:06.83]Hey, what the hell?
[269:10.11]I... Are you okay?
[269:14.41]Dude, here, let me help you.
[269:21.02]Thanks, Susie, but I... God, it's not strong enough.
[269:27.22]Quick, Chris, let's find Rousey.
[269:28.62]Maybe he can heal him.
[269:33.22]Wait, wait.
[269:35.14]You two aren't going to leave without me, are you?
[269:38.25]Uh, yeah, we are.
[269:40.23]But, Noelle, my damsel in distress.
[269:41.85]She must be in distress.
[269:44.99]If I cannot help her, then... Okay, fine.
[269:47.43]Come with us.
[269:47.81]Shut up.
[269:54.50]The nameplate reads, Burgly, I mean, Birdly.
[269:57.90]Peek inside.
[269:59.08]Yes.
[270:00.46]You saw surprised you, sort of.
[270:03.51]Okay.
[270:06.35]Nameplate reads, Catty's Room.
[270:07.99]Peek inside.
[270:08.56]Sure.

[270:12.34]It's animated too.
[270:19.71]Nameplate reads, Jockington's Room.
[270:21.93]Peek inside.
[270:22.53]Sure.
[270:24.83]Beautiful.
[270:26.39]Is there a save point?
[270:32.91]If you escape from your second personalized room of the day, you're filled with the power of vacation homes.
[270:45.96]This is an ideal stopping point just so you know the final act of the chapter kind of starts here.
[270:49.60]Oh, okay.
[270:51.54]Um... Okay.
[270:56.88]This is like we're going to the final hour or two?
[271:01.26]Ban that guy.
[271:04.50]Hold on just a minute.
[271:06.54]Because... Oh, it's all the shovels.
[271:12.56]Seems like the room is overflowing with shovels.
[271:15.01]And you don't have anything to dig through them with.
[271:18.59]Who said that?
[271:19.43]Whoa.
[271:26.66]It's a copy of an online skateboarding game.
[271:29.08]From search query, cool skateboarding game online.
[271:34.32]Somewhat glitched out hologram.

[271:45.23]Susie's talk tube thing looks a bit bigger for her larger head.
[271:48.11]An egg?
[271:50.43]Painted egg.
[271:51.13]It's warm.
[271:52.35]From... Can parboil eggs hatch?
[271:57.44]Vacuum-powered book.
[271:59.20]From search query losers.
[272:00.76]This library sucks.
[272:13.67]Can I go in any of the rooms?
[272:17.99]He respected the gamer's code.
[272:19.68]No screen peeking.
[272:24.46]You can smell the glittery cat food from here anyways.
[272:30.75]Uh, let's know.
[272:31.97]You feel like Noelle would enjoy this more.
[272:37.42]Asriel's room.
[272:38.26]Peek inside.
[272:39.00]Yes.
[272:39.90]You open the door with your eyes closed.
[272:41.68]You saw nothing.
[272:45.74]With a feeling you wouldn't learn anything.
[272:47.08]Looks like a puzzle.
[272:56.89]Think.
[272:57.77]Uh, think!
[272:58.61]You can do it, Chris!
[273:02.16]Calm your skinless, boneless thighs, everyone.
[273:05.96]I'll think of a solution.
[273:08.27]Chris, just ignore him.
[273:09.57]I'll just be over here where I can't hear you.
[273:13.07]I'll be here, away from your IQ-debuffing aura.
[273:22.20]These dark bulbs will cast a bright shadow on the ground.
[273:26.72]Why are you doing a Castle Griffin stage voice?
[273:28.60]I don't know, because he's like, I'm a hero, I'm a champion.
[273:32.13]He's like LARPing.
[273:33.37]So that's why.
[273:37.25]Fill in the space with dark to unlock the way.
[273:43.50]Alright.
[273:45.86]See you tomorrow.
[273:47.14]Oh fuck, I can't leave.
[273:50.00]Ah, Chris, still stumped by this simple diversion.
[273:52.77]I'll put your neurons back in the crayon box, Chris.
[273:55.43]I can already feel the solution welling up in my brain cavity.
[273:58.89]Eureka!
[273:59.79]That's what I will say.
[274:00.53]Now go.
[274:01.07]Uh, I saved it back there.
[274:06.71]Yeah, alright, if this is a good stopping point, then this is a good stopping point.
[274:09.09]I'm gonna, I'm streaming tomorrow.
[274:11.57]But I, we're doing two days this weekend, so don't worry.
[274:25.23]Is this a good point?
[274:26.21]Yeah.
[274:27.13]This is alright.
[274:29.67]So tomorrow might be a little longer then.
[274:32.13]Maybe.
[274:33.53]Because if this is only another two hours, maybe.
[274:36.59]Three hours.
[274:38.51]Less.
[274:40.50]Then the Umbrella game... Yeah, I think that makes sense.
[274:45.88]Because I think there's like two or three hours in the Umbrella game left.
[274:49.72]And there's like two hours left in this.
[274:53.41]So, that's a... Should be like a five to six hour stream tomorrow.
[275:03.96]You have about two hours to completion if you do the secret area?
[275:06.68]Yeah, then that makes sense then.
[275:09.70]I want time tomorrow to be able to... Well, not time tomorrow.
[275:12.34]I want... I want to have enough content tomorrow.
[275:15.71]Because I don't know if the Umbrella game has more than an hour or two.
[275:28.42]Two hours, Pepe left.
[275:33.33]Well, like three hours, to be honest.
[275:35.67]Yeah, but I think we'll be okay.
[275:40.28]Depends on how long you take on some of the bosses.
[275:41.96]Yeah.
[275:45.36]And look, tomorrow, we can go a little long tomorrow.
[275:47.64]It's fine.
[275:49.10]I wanted to make sure I started it and got to a point where we could do it again tomorrow.
[276:02.90]Okay.
[276:03.12]And look, if it takes four or five hours to do tomorrow, then whatever.
[276:09.10]That'll be it.
[276:11.14]I don't want to rush through this.
[276:12.84]That's the problem.
[276:13.44]I want to take a time to actually take in the information and stuff.
[276:19.75]Because before, I don't know if you guys remember, if a game was like seven to eight hours before, like seven-ish hours, I would just blow through the whole thing in one stream sometimes and then just be done with it.
[276:31.50]And then it's just like, okay, that's it.
[276:32.66]See you later.
[276:34.56]I really want to like process this shit.
[276:36.84]It's like I've been waiting for this game to come out for a while.
[276:40.70]I don't just want to like just inhale like eight hours of a gamer session and just forget the whole game.
[276:46.96]I need my turtle half to process the game.
[276:51.72]Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.
[276:53.12]Start at the same time, 2 o'clock Pacific.
[276:56.52]We'll finish this, and if there's time, we'll finish the Umbrella game.
[277:04.06]Have a great rest of your evening.
[277:12.53]We're not done yet.
[277:14.37]Because I'm going to go like this.
[277:21.43]Thanks for the subs.
[277:23.11]Appreciate it, everybody.
[277:24.27]Thank you.
[277:27.92]Very much appreciated.
[277:35.04]A little shorter than usual, but, you know, these days I don't really have a timer.
[277:41.19]But I do want each stream to be at least four to five hours.
[277:43.95]Maybe we go a little long tomorrow.
[277:51.95]Or any Grotto Beasts thing?
[277:52.87]When Grotto Beasts?
[277:55.53]We will be talking very, very deeply about Grotto Beasts.
[278:00.78]I'm hoping.
[278:02.66]Very deeply, and I mean very deeply.
[278:06.44]About a month from now.
[278:07.66]You'll be hearing a lot about it, I would say.
[278:09.09]Because I really want to make sure that
[278:16.01]It's possible to get it out for this year's, like, holiday season.
[278:20.19]That's what we're trying to do.
[278:22.75]See if we hit that target.
[278:30.30]Grotto Beasts Tournament Prize Pool.
[278:40.60]Philosophical Grotto Beasts discussion with Professor Jerma.
[278:48.74]Wait, what is Grotto Beasts?
[278:50.36]You don't even need to know until I tell you probably three or four weeks from now.
[279:02.47]But, I think before that, you'll probably hear about a few things.
[279:08.72]Especially considering... Well, you know what?
[279:10.28]Why don't we just... Yeah.
[279:12.34]You know what?
[279:12.66]Maybe tomorrow or the next... No.
[279:13.62]No, no, no.
[279:14.24]I don't want to... Let me talk to people today and tonight and tomorrow.
[279:18.23]And make sure I get you some correct information.
[279:21.65]So... Maybe we'll talk about some stuff tomorrow.
[279:27.61]So now that you said that it's going to be another three months...
[279:34.86]Well, I mean, technically, it probably is going to be three months before you can see it.
[279:39.57]Because that's when I want to have you be able to get it.
[279:45.87]Turn that off.
[279:49.98]I don't have a release date for it.
[279:51.20]All I know is I want to be able to have it accessible before the end of December.
[279:56.34]That's what I want.
[279:58.70]If it's possible, we'll see.
[279:59.66]If not, then it'll come probably shortly after that.
[280:02.05]I hope.
[280:15.24]Oh, that's it, Tip of the Hats.
[280:17.52]So if you didn't know, actually a lot of people that are probably new to the channel don't really know that much about me, maybe, more than the last few years.
[280:27.49]But it was the Team Fortress 2 community did a charity event every year.
[280:32.29]It's called Tip of the Hats.
[280:34.53]And I would participate in it as of, probably I'd say like a few years ago.
[280:42.01]And I think they're doing their final one
[280:45.39]This... The next couple of days, I think.
[280:49.96]So, go, uh... Definitely go support them.
[280:53.10]All the old TF2 guys.
[280:54.58]I think they've moved on, too.
[280:56.78]I think they're doing, like, Valorant stuff now, and... Um... They're all really, really good people.
[281:01.91]So... Uh, we're gonna raid them.
[281:05.91]But this is the final one.
[281:07.27]Go support it.
[281:08.03]Go say hello.
[281:10.76]And I will see you guys tomorrow.
[281:13.22]Oh, they're ending right now?
[281:14.36]Alright, hold this for tomorrow.
[281:15.36]Hold this for tomorrow.
[281:16.32]It just ended.
[281:16.98]Oh, shit.
[281:18.80]Shit!
[281:20.10]Alright.
[281:20.78]I think they're going tomorrow.
[281:22.00]They'll be back tomorrow.
[281:22.88]Alright.
[281:23.87]We'll get them tomorrow.
[281:28.81]Hold!
[281:29.33]Hold till tomorrow!
[281:31.15]We're going there tomorrow!
[281:33.19]Bad timing, Andy.
[281:35.53]But honestly, like, okay, so tomorrow before I go live.
[281:38.09]They're gonna be live before I am.
[281:40.03]I'm certain of it.
[281:40.87]Probably around, like, 11am?
[281:41.41]Um...
[281:44.07]I think they're gonna be live tomorrow, somewhere around 11 to 12.
[281:47.82]Um... Central time, maybe?
[281:50.14]So they'll be live before I am, so go support them.
[281:52.42]Before you, you know... If you want to stay, then stay there.
[281:56.88]So now, alright, but we'll see if we can catch them tomorrow.
[282:02.81]Well, now I gotta... Alright, well, where are we gonna go?
[282:05.49]Who's streaming right now?
[282:13.16]Um... Who's live?
[282:36.77]Oh shit, I just broke my chair.
[282:38.61]Hold on, I was like leaning too far.
[282:44.70]What the fuck?
[282:50.82]Okay.
[282:54.37]Uh, we're gonna... Let's go say hi to Criken.
[282:58.15]I actually... I think I actually did break the chair.
[283:00.03]How did I fucking do this?
[283:01.39]Do I have to go get another chair?
[283:02.41]I haven't really, um... How did I fuck this up?
[283:15.05]No, we're not delaying tomorrow because of that.
[283:16.85]Uh, go say hi to Criken.
[283:18.81]If you don't know, Criken was a huge part of the Dollhouse stream.
[283:22.53]I know a few weeks ago we did the, um, behind-the-scenes show.
[283:27.21]But... Go say hello.
[283:29.43]Playing Minecraft?
[283:31.17]What are you doing in Minecraft, Criken?
[283:34.01]Building a spooky sky carnival.
[283:35.69]Holy shit!
[283:38.87]Uh, go say hi.
[283:40.34]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[283:43.10]More Chapter 2 of... I almost said Undertale, but that's not true.
[283:46.72]Take care of yourselves.
[283:52.72]See you soon.
[283:54.36]Bye.
[283:54.94]Good night.
[283:55.30]See you later.
[284:34.65]you
