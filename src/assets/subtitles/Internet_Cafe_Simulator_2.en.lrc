[00:14.86]You know, it seemed like it was potentially a funny idea.
[00:27.05]I didn't want to delay the stream, though.
[00:38.80]Oh, damn it.
[00:41.30]Don't freak out.
[00:41.86]That's what they say.
[00:42.28]Don't freak out.
[00:47.04]I wonder if I can reach back here.
[00:48.74]I've been sitting here like this for at least 30 minutes.
[00:51.91]I put- I put chicken grease in my hair?!
[00:55.43]Wait a minute.
[01:08.00]Nice swag, thanks.

[01:42.73]So I think we just have to stream.
[01:44.57]Wait, what do these buttons do?
[01:47.80]What does this button do?
[01:57.08]It's like a depiction of an angel in the Bible or something.
[02:02.24]I'd just be like... Like, yes, my son.
[02:08.62]Like, yes.
[02:15.29]Are you okay?
[02:15.75]I'm alright.
[02:16.97]I got a shave, though.
[02:17.71]You can see how weird I look.
[02:20.91]Alright, let's go ahead and... Whoa!
[02:26.60]Holy... Are you kidding me?
[02:28.16]Oh, no.
[02:29.38]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:35.16]See?
[02:35.60]I'm not ugly.
[02:36.24]I can't even use this now.
[02:45.25]You want to see if I'm fucked up?
[02:46.57]Watch this.
[02:46.98]Ready?
[02:51.64]Everyone looks like that, okay?
[02:54.80]Anyways.
[02:55.20]Wait, I need to keep this on.
[02:55.94]No, I don't.
[02:57.24]Turn it off.
[03:00.05]I got it off.
[03:00.63]The chicken grease worked.
[03:03.05]Hey, I'll be live in two seconds.
[03:04.03]It's dual personality.
[03:14.31]Oh shit, that's probably loud, sorry.
[03:15.73]Hey, stream's starting!
[03:20.85]Where's Shito?
[03:25.50]What?
[03:26.06]No, there's no Shito today.
[03:30.80]Shito needs batteries to turn his brain back on.
[03:35.85]And I don't have the batteries that are required.
[03:42.92]You took Shido off the shelf?
[03:44.50]No, I didn't.
[03:47.22]What are you talking about?
[03:48.00]He's right there.
[03:51.81]Look.
[03:53.47]He's sleeping.
[03:58.05]He's sleeping.
[04:11.74]I can hear it.
[04:12.36]Can you hear it?
[04:19.18]Hey, oh, okay.
[04:20.30]Well, geez, I'm sorry.
[04:22.72]No, no, no, no, no.
[04:24.00]I haven't turned them on in like two years.
[04:30.62]Yeah, I know.
[04:35.63]Well, you can go back to sleep for a little while.
[04:41.40]Alright, alright, settle down.
[04:42.32]Settle down.
[04:42.70]Stop, stop.
[04:43.28]Alright, I get it, I get it.
[04:45.84]I'll, okay, yeah, we, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[04:47.70]So, shh.
[04:50.10]Okay.
[04:51.38]Back to sleep.
[04:54.92]Uh, he said he's very grateful that everyone thought he was cool.
[04:57.61]And that people were happy that he was going to make a return.
[05:01.29]He was mad that I kept him asleep for two years.
[05:04.51]I did say that, I said I was going on like a long weekend trip.
[05:08.30]Two and a half years ago.
[05:09.06]And I was like, oh, we'll just shut you off for a little while.
[05:10.64]And it's been two years.
[05:15.82]I will get you new batteries, Chico.
[05:19.05]Plumber for a little longer.
[05:24.19]Hey, we're starting the stream soon.
[05:25.25]Just a minute.
[05:26.97]Did you smoke crack?
[05:28.19]I don't smoke crack.
[05:29.13]I don't smoke crack.
[05:29.95]I don't smoke crack.
[05:30.73]I don't smoke crack.
[05:31.91]I don't smoke crack.
[05:43.44]He's roleplaying and he's 36.
[05:46.30]Who cares?
[05:47.99]Why?
[05:48.47]Does that even matter?
[05:49.31]I can't roleplay at 36?
[05:56.85]Okay, well then every actor has to retire when they turn 30.
[05:59.74]How does that sound?
[06:04.26]Today, we're gonna- I know I lied, I'm sorry.
[06:09.28]There will never be an actor, there will never be like a, like an old man in any movie or TV show you ever watch ever again.
[06:16.78]It'll be people that are like 30 and like 40 in makeup.
[06:26.87]Okay, so we're gonna play Internet Cafe Simulator 2 today.
[06:32.22]I, uh, I know I lied.
[06:33.78]I said we're gonna play Everhood.
[06:34.82]I'm really sorry.
[06:37.10]But... I've kind of... Ow.
[06:40.86]I... Listen.
[06:43.08]I kind of had a headache.
[06:45.74]And Everhood is a game I don't think you want to play with a headache.
[06:50.06]But I've seen some of this game.
[06:51.48]It looks like it could be interesting.
[06:53.38]It seems kind of up my alley.
[06:56.14]I was like, I want to try it.
[06:56.86]It's a simulator game.
[07:00.84]Fart Simulator.
[07:01.42]I know.
[07:02.42]Why would I need to explain it to you?
[07:10.38]This game is not a game you want to play with a headache either.
[07:13.47]Why?
[07:15.17]Yeah, I'm having a good time.
[07:20.63]I'm just hanging out.
[07:21.31]Hopefully you're doing okay too.
[07:22.75]Pretty cool.
[07:25.25]This is a simulator game.
[07:31.20]I beat this in the entire time I was just wishing I could see you play it.
[07:33.92]I'm excited.
[07:34.68]Oh, that's good.
[07:35.36]Cool.
[07:38.53]You lost 4,000 people.
[07:40.77]No, I did not.
[07:42.51]I have my analytics open.
[07:46.93]I can see my analytics.
[07:47.85]Alright, so let's get started.
[07:58.32]Let me just Ster my coffee, not into the microphone.
[08:06.10]How do you feel about being called an e-clown?
[08:09.58]I... We made that term up here.
[08:15.98]That's not... Somebody didn't make that term up and then call me that.
[08:23.03]Like, that's like a... Only a few communities even use that term.
[08:30.11]So, who cares?
[08:30.85]Alright.
[08:36.33]Hold on, let me get this going here.
[08:41.80]I don't even have my dashboard open.
[08:43.12]What an idiot.
[08:46.53]Play the game?
[08:47.09]It's the intro.
[08:48.33]Just give me a second.
[08:53.31]Oh, there we go.
[08:54.29]There we go.
[08:55.09]Okay.
[08:58.07]Is the camera still on?
[08:59.39]No.
[08:59.89]No cam.
[09:01.95]Off.
[09:05.13]Is it going to be a ring light next stream?
[09:08.12]No, I'm not going to torture myself like that.
[09:15.11]There was also a heated debate in the chat room earlier about Hamburger Helper and I- I- I feel like I need to- we have to talk about it.
[09:28.44]I got a lot of shit because- alright, first let me ask a really quick question.
[09:34.31]Do you guys know, in the chat, ones in the chat, do you know what Hamburger Helper is?
[09:42.65]Because apparently it was fucking crazy that a guy was saying these words.
[09:47.74]I was like, yeah, a hamburger helper, you get the cheeseburger mac, and what you do is you do this, you do this.
[09:51.34]Everyone's like, what are you talking about?
[09:53.14]What is hamburger helper?
[09:54.80]Help what?
[10:00.16]It's good, yeah.
[10:01.62]And I was talking about a little recipe that I had.
[10:05.96]If you don't know what hamburger, this is what it looks like.
[10:10.05]It doesn't look like that.
[10:12.12]It doesn't look like that.
[10:13.18]It looks like this.
[10:13.72]So that's Hamburger Helper.
[10:18.32]People would like show us the box.
[10:19.76]There's the box.
[10:28.66]I can't even not laugh at that.
[10:31.02]What was that?
[10:31.56]I don't know.
[10:33.16]It was like an image on my desktop.
[10:35.68]It comes with real cheese.
[10:37.04]Okay, this is what Hamburger... Listen.
[10:39.31]Hamburger Helper.
[10:41.26]is a boxed macaroni product.
[10:43.82]You take a pound of ground beef and you mix it in with this whole box.
[10:48.44]And it turns into this macaroni dish, right?
[10:50.84]It looks like this.
[10:54.09]This one here.
[10:55.87]Uh, this is a good one.
[10:56.91]Yeah, this one.
[11:00.60]It looks like that.
[11:02.38]It tastes... It's... I mean, okay.
[11:04.62]The entire time you're making Hamburger Helper, you're grossed out.
[11:08.18]It's disgusting looking.
[11:09.18]It feels gross.
[11:10.00]It's like you hate it.
[11:11.66]And like, you don't even like looking at it.
[11:13.27]But when you take a bite, it's hard not to eat the whole box.
[11:16.95]At least, you know, between a few people.
[11:20.31]So what I said... What should I put?
[11:22.31]Let me name this.
[11:24.84]Oh, right.
[11:28.26]EXP and Espresso.
[11:30.71]It's the name of the, uh, cafe.
[11:31.71]What are you talking about?
[11:37.77]That's Hamburger Helper.
[11:40.07]Is it actually a stolen name?
[11:41.64]No, it's not.
[11:42.36]From where?
[11:47.08]It looks worse, though.
[11:48.24]No, but, okay.
[11:49.56]So you take the Hamburger Helper, you eat it, maybe you put a little bit of onion in it, maybe you put some, you know, parsley, whatever the hell you want, some other bullshit to make it taste a little better, be a little nicer, whatever.
[11:59.23]But my case that I was making to pre-stream chat was what I do, because you don't just make like half a box of hamburger helper, right?
[12:09.67]You don't just make one, like, oh, I'm going to make like a third of a box of hamburger helper.
[12:13.43]It doesn't work that way.
[12:15.15]So you make a shitload of it, and then you store it.
[12:18.24]And what I said is after you take it out...
[12:21.51]After you store it, you put it between two pieces of bread, or two pieces of toasted bread or bun, and you eat it like a sandwich.
[12:31.50]You heat it up, you heat the hamburger helper up in the microwave for like 20 seconds or something, and then you put it between bread and you eat it.
[12:38.28]And then you put some ketchup on the side and you dip it in the ketchup.
[12:40.58]I- okay.
[12:42.30]Even my mods are like, you're fucked up.
[12:47.12]But that's eating the leftovers, though.
[12:50.03]Okay, you can adapt to the game in a shorter time.
[12:51.97]Okay, don't worry, they're not boring and long.
[12:55.45]Yeah, WC, tab, skills.
[12:57.57]Is this skills?
[12:58.21]Okay.
[12:58.39]I have a punch.
[13:00.67]That sensitivity's gotta go way down.
[13:06.60]Uh, even more than that.
[13:09.08]Yeah, you dip it in ketchup.
[13:13.32]That's better.
[13:16.17]But it makes the, honestly, it makes the leftovers more interesting.
[13:21.16]No joke, that sounds really good, because it is.
[13:23.57]I have a punch.
[13:29.17]I tried to get my girlfriend to take a bite.
[13:34.09]And she did not want to.
[13:36.49]In fact, I got a really, really bad look.
[13:42.45]I don't... It's just leftovers.
[13:44.15]How to press... Call the elevator, okay.
[13:55.91]Yeah.
[13:56.31]I have a weird palate sometimes.
[13:58.83]Yes, it's a current girlfriend.
[14:03.24]It's a current girlfriend.
[14:06.72]I alluded... Alright.
[14:09.96]I alluded to this on Christmas Eve.
[14:13.06]And I think it's time to talk about it.
[14:16.45]I have a girlfriend.
[14:17.77]I've had a girlfriend since early last year.
[14:20.75]I've been pretty private about it.
[14:23.33]For a magnitude of reasons.
[14:28.23]But ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to announce, she's in the chat right now.
[14:34.58]Where can we meet her?
[14:35.26]She's here now.
[14:40.62]And the reason why we kept it private is because we wanted to
[14:45.90]We wanted to find a good place to do this.
[14:47.92]Because I didn't want to kind of just throw her into this whole thing.
[14:52.23]And have it be like, oh, hey, come on.
[14:53.97]Everybody, you and you all know who this is.
[14:57.01]She's a community member.
[14:58.79]And she's been a community member for a while.
[15:01.07]This is not a joke.
[15:03.17]It's Halulu.
[15:04.25]She's in chat right now.
[15:06.55]It's not you.
[15:07.39]It's her.
[15:08.47]It's not community Jake.
[15:13.97]Does she know?
[15:15.00]What?
[15:16.98]She does.
[15:21.85]And ever since Christmas Eve, I know people are like, what are you talking about?
[15:26.17]What did that mean?
[15:26.69]How do I get out of the fucking elevator?
[15:32.12]Do you guys kiss?
[15:33.66]Of course we do.
[15:35.60]But I will say this, all through 2020 and into 2021, right?
[15:41.88]I think I've been dropping some hints to you guys about how much better my personal life was getting.
[15:48.44]You've probably seen a few different times where I've been like, hey, somewhere like at some point last year where I was like, hey, my personal life is going really well.
[15:58.24]I'm really happy right now.
[16:00.82]She had a lot to do with that.
[16:03.28]So, um, we were trying to find the right way to, like, introduce her.
[16:07.04]Uh, and she's fucking amazing, so.
[16:11.40]Taken Andy, that's it.
[16:12.57]Alright, I gotta get out of my fucking apartment.
[16:22.11]How do I leave?
[16:28.08]Okay, here we go.
[16:30.56]Is this an elaborate bit?
[16:31.60]It is not an elaborate bit.
[16:36.70]How do I go up the elevator?
[16:42.60]What do I do?
[16:44.52]Two?
[16:45.92]One?
[16:46.82]What?
[16:47.93]Where am I?
[16:48.49]I thought I was... I'm already on the third floor?
[16:50.83]I thought I wasn't like... Oh, okay.
[17:01.42]Let's go.
[17:04.37]But all through 2021, I kept my private life pretty private.
[17:07.77]I was only streaming like once a week.
[17:09.95]My health was in the fucking shitter.
[17:11.93]You all know that.
[17:15.00]Squid Game?
[17:18.28]Alright, go to your internet cafe.
[17:20.52]Press M. VTC Miner?
[17:25.02]Okay, that's my home.
[17:26.42]That's my cafe.
[17:27.28]I'm ready to fucking rock and roll.
[17:31.50]I can punch people.
[17:32.44]I know that for a fact.
[17:41.44]Wait, this is the sus guy?
[17:42.74]Don't tell her that.
[17:44.08]She already knows that.
[17:47.32]But you'll probably be seeing a lot more of her in the future.
[17:50.06]Because obviously I wanted to wait until we were both comfortable kind of talking about it, so.
[17:55.52]There you go.
[17:58.10]There's your girlfriend announcement.
[18:00.80]What the fuck are you doing?
[18:02.70]Alright, so where's my cafe?
[18:03.88]Up here?
[18:15.44]Does anybody care that I just did that?
[18:19.46]Alright, should I hide?
[18:20.24]That was rude.
[18:25.73]Alright.
[18:26.47]Grab the mop and clean your cafe.
[18:27.83]There's cleaning in this game, so yeah, you know, I'm gonna fucking love it.
[18:37.56]Any plans for her to feature on the stream?
[18:40.26]Um... If she wants to.
[18:42.72]And that's another thing, too.
[18:43.84]I didn't want to, like...
[18:46.48]The reason to keep a relationship private is because, obviously, you guys know, and this is real talk here.
[18:51.32]This is really just me being real.
[18:53.94]I live a pretty private life.
[18:55.04]Besides, like, the public, you know, streams and stuff.
[18:59.97]So, I like to separate that kind of stuff.
[19:03.27]But, if she ever wanted to do something like that, I'm sure that we could, it would be fun, yeah.
[19:11.39]He's an enigma.
[19:12.77]Not, I'm really not, though.
[19:14.53]Like, that's the thing.
[19:15.33]I'm really not.
[19:19.37]I'm really not that complicated.
[19:21.27]I'm pretty simple.
[19:31.05]We know.
[19:31.53]Alright, so that's clean.
[19:39.75]Very cool.
[19:43.21]We call her the sus lady.
[19:46.66]I, I don't, I, well, I mean, she's here right now.
[19:48.68]You literally can ask her.
[19:49.46]She's in the chat.
[19:50.26]I don't think she wants to be called the sus lady, though.
[19:53.70]The electricity's off.
[19:54.92]Alright, let's turn on the electricity.
[19:56.20]How do I use the computer?
[19:59.06]There's space to start the computer.
[20:01.07]No electricity.
[20:03.05]Oh.
[20:05.53]How do I turn the electricity on?
[20:13.31]Oh, shit.
[20:13.73]Alright.
[20:19.17]iComputer case, monitor, and keyboard mouse on Zamabzor.
[20:28.94]Why did you announce your girlfriend while playing Fart Simulator?
[20:38.81]What?
[20:39.01]I...
[20:42.13]I don't know, we talked about Hamburger Helper, and, like, she was literally in this house.
[20:47.37]We were eating it, and I figured it was a good place to do it.
[21:02.63]You're feeding her Hamburger Helper.
[21:04.89]I'm not feeding... Look, she can eat whatever she wants.
[21:09.07]We eat together.
[21:10.11]We eat whatever we want.
[21:11.53]Nobody has to eat Hamburger Helper sandwiches dipped in ketchup.
[21:15.19]I just had to validate the fact that this was a real thing I was doing.
[21:18.91]Okay, buy compute from Zamazor.
[21:26.37]Warcry?
[21:27.33]Crack?
[21:29.97]Do I have money?
[21:33.27]Alright, Zamazor.
[21:35.39]Where's my money?
[21:37.03]I got 2,000 bucks.
[21:37.87]Alright.
[21:38.51]Computer cases.
[21:44.88]Buy a computer case.
[21:46.14]Do I care which one it is?
[21:49.22]Old computer case.
[21:52.00]Add to basket.
[21:52.60]Is it there?
[21:56.33]Computer case, monitor, and keyboard.
[21:57.97]Keyboard.
[22:01.41]Keyboard.
[22:03.04]Okay.
[22:04.37]And a mouse.
[22:09.27]This thing looks like a cell phone from like 1992.
[22:11.85]1991.
[22:12.51]Alright, now what?
[22:19.26]Alright.
[22:19.52]Why am I like in 800x600 resolution?
[22:21.90]Okay.
[22:27.36]Is this the same dev that made Streamer Life Simulator?
[22:29.86]I have no idea, actually.
[22:30.79]That's a good question.
[22:32.70]Alright, so get up.
[22:38.52]Does she know about Otto?
[22:39.40]She loves Otto.
[22:40.24]Okay, so... Oh, this is the guy I punched in the face.
[22:51.35]Why is he just sitting here?
[22:52.21]Alright, that was kind of scary.
[22:59.17]What happened?
[22:59.67]What happened?
[23:03.39]What is going on?
[23:05.87]Why is this guy walking over here with an exclamation point?
[23:09.89]Why are there so many just animals?
[23:12.43]Press E to talk to the beggar.
[23:13.89]I know everything that happens in this city, man.
[23:17.52]You're the owner of that new internet cafe.
[23:18.94]They smashed the man who worked at the cafe before you, man.
[23:21.98]If he got on well with me, this wouldn't have happened to him.
[23:25.90]If you want to build BTC mining rig in this city, you have to pay me license first.
[23:31.42]I want to just run an internet cafe, man.
[23:40.01]Is she taller than you?
[23:47.94]Oh, okay.
[23:52.38]No.
[23:52.60]Alright, old computer case.
[23:56.51]Where do I have to put this?
[24:00.85]This guy just keeps looking at me.
[24:02.15]I don't... This is freaking me out.
[24:07.51]Oh, shit.
[24:07.89]Wait, wait, wait.
[24:08.35]Okay, I get it.
[24:08.71]I get it.
[24:09.07]No, I get it.
[24:09.59]I understand.
[24:11.51]I want to put it like here.
[24:15.09]This is it?
[24:17.47]This is a tiny room.
[24:18.35]This is a bathroom.
[24:23.67]Where's the... Where's the... What happened to the stuff?
[24:32.36]Oh, there.
[24:32.64]It's like blending into the ground.
[24:37.92]Alright, keyboard.
[24:39.50]And then I assume that I have to put the... What about a monitor?
[24:48.26]Oh, shit, I need a... I don't have a monitor.
[24:50.82]Alright, I gotta get a monitor.
[24:51.64]Did you guys come up with Grotto Beasts together?
[24:59.33]Yes, we did.
[25:01.47]We were actually sitting just outside with a hammer breaking geodes.
[25:07.85]we thought this was like a really cool idea and you've probably you've seen a lot of her stuff okay remember the sunflowers I've been like dropping hints about this for like at least the last six fucking months do you remember when I zoomed in on the sunflowers and there was a little picture of Otto she drew that she also took all those sunflower pictures
[25:35.25]Everybody was saying, I remember, they were like, wow, these photos look really, really awesome.
[25:41.27]It's almost, did he hire a professional photographer?
[25:43.65]No, it was just my girlfriend.
[25:50.24]But no, she's awesome.
[25:51.64]I couldn't be happier.
[25:53.50]We were just trying to find like an opportunity to kind of talk about it.
[25:57.40]Not be like private about it anymore, but I just did that for me, right?
[26:01.21]And for her.
[26:03.62]Being private about this stuff was important because you never know, right?
[26:07.16]Like, I never wanted to make somebody like content, right?
[26:13.50]That was a huge part of it.
[26:16.24]Until we were comfortable.
[26:17.08]And if she's comfortable, if she wants to be on streams or something, then yeah, sure.
[26:21.37]Fuck yeah.
[26:23.75]But... I... That's the reason why you didn't hear about this months and months and months ago.
[26:33.72]Could I be your son?
[26:34.44]No, I don't... Nah.
[26:43.38]She's not real.
[26:44.02]Alright, let's go.
[26:50.12]No more hamburger helper talk.
[26:52.46]We don't have to talk about that anymore.
[26:54.10]We're over that.
[26:55.46]It's delicious.
[26:56.22]It's actually a good way to eat the leftovers.
[26:59.73]Trust me, I'm a professional clown.
[27:03.63]That's a lie.
[27:04.07]I don't want to get in trouble for saying that.
[27:05.83]I made that up.
[27:06.37]I've never been formally trained as a clown.
[27:08.95]Alright, maybe a good monitor.
[27:10.15]Should I get a good one?
[27:12.21]How about this one?
[27:12.79]This one's $3.50.
[27:13.05]Alright, where's the... Where's the basket?
[27:27.46]Is that too expensive?
[27:28.42]Should I not buy this?
[27:37.06]Maybe I shouldn't buy it.
[27:39.60]Get a CRT.
[27:41.68]Just get the shit out of me.
[27:43.36]You just saw, like, the mouse tremble.
[27:44.58]It should be dual... Camel Prime.
[27:48.64]Okay.
[27:51.32]There's just so many animals.
[27:52.29]Why are there so many animals in the game?
[27:53.77]Alright, there's an LCD.
[27:56.07]So how do I, like, start the business?
[28:03.27]Alright.

[28:26.02]Setup is not complete.
[28:27.14]How do I set it up?
[28:28.02]Oh, we need a chair?
[28:29.02]Is that a cop?
[28:34.75]Okay.
[28:36.63]Chair.
[28:36.93]I have to use this outdoor plastic chair?
[28:43.72]Like that.
[28:44.76]Alright, open the cafe.
[28:45.64]You can do it from the main PC.
[28:48.04]Oh, hell yeah.

[28:55.24]Cafe opened.
[28:56.20]Wait for the first customer to arrive.
[28:57.74]Okay.

[29:07.97]I need a chair.
[29:08.61]I got a chair right here.
[29:23.32]When's your VTuber debut?
[29:25.62]I don't know, man.
[29:28.94]You should punch that person.
[29:29.94]I'm not punching anybody.
[29:30.81]Do I have to do anything else, or just people... Oh.
[29:38.15]Alright.
[29:40.05]Customer sent you a request to turn on the computer.
[29:44.85]Turn it on.
[29:56.56]On your computer.
[29:58.46]Oh.
[29:58.56]I was like, wow, it wouldn't even request to turn it on.
[30:05.37]Oh, request.

[30:16.70]He's just playing?
[30:22.33]What the fuck?
[30:22.97]Oh.
[30:24.53]Four dollars and five cents.
[30:30.03]Why did you only use the computer for ten minutes?
[30:33.04]You could have gone to the fucking library.
[30:36.08]Why did you do that?
[30:41.40]Oh.
[30:46.26]Oh, wait.
[30:46.56]Alright.
[30:47.44]What do you want?

[30:59.06]The cafes that open around here are like shit.
[31:03.07]Wait, that's why he left?
[31:04.07]Because they don't have a game?
[31:08.31]You can't watch porn?
[31:09.79]Why are you watching porn?
[31:10.89]You can't watch that.
[31:11.77]I thought this was a... Oh, no.

[31:37.82]I'm not watching.
[31:38.18]Someone's going to come and think I'm watching this.
[31:39.54]How do I turn this off?
[31:41.14]I'm not watching this.
[31:42.28]This is not on my stream and I'm not streaming.
[31:43.93]I'm not playing this.
[31:44.45]Someone's going to think it's me doing this.
[31:46.09]How do I turn the computer off?
[31:48.31]I didn't want to comment badly, but what garbage.
[31:50.35]Yeah, don't watch porn in my cafe.
[31:52.59]How do I turn that?
[31:53.21]How do I get that off?
[31:55.95]How do I?
[31:56.96]Okay, thank God somebody cut the electricity.
[32:01.76]Fuck, what?
[32:03.24]Why is it permanently there?
[32:05.26]The computer was turned off.
[32:08.56]How do I get that off?
[32:19.98]Alright, I need to do a quest.
[32:22.39]It's got screen burning.
[32:23.77]Alright, should I do a quest?
[32:25.99]What is that here?
[32:32.67]Alright, it can't be there anymore, right?
[32:34.85]It can't be.
[32:36.85]Okay, good.
[32:37.25]It's like rebooting.
[32:38.03]It's all fucked up.
[32:48.70]God damn it.
[32:53.18]Will somebody please come in here and get that off the fucking computer before I get, like, banned?
[33:00.00]Please?
[33:02.29]Why is nobody coming to my... I almost said restaurant.
[33:06.75]Somebody come in and use my computer!
[33:11.57]How do I get... I think that's why... I think I broke the game.
[33:23.29]Mop the computer.
[33:30.99]This is how a caveman would handle this.
[33:34.45]I don't know what to do.
[33:35.21]Oh, hi, sir.
[33:36.03]How are you?
[33:36.93]Come on into the internet cafe.
[33:38.79]This is not my computer.

[35:40.95]I'm the porn place now.
[35:45.06]Who watches porn like this?
[35:51.10]Nobody watches porn leaning back like that in the chair.
[35:55.10]I don't know... Yes, thank you for coming.
[36:00.74]They do pay a lot of money though.
[36:02.06]Alright, what we got?
[36:07.41]Chair.
[36:20.59]Okay.
[36:23.87]Console.
[36:26.29]Spray that guy with a fire extinguisher.
[36:27.77]I'm not spraying anybody with a fire extinguisher.
[36:29.37]Oh, I need a table.
[36:30.11]Shit.
[36:33.22]Don't touch this.
[36:33.98]I probably should get more than one controller, right?
[36:47.41]My frames are dropping.
[36:49.17]They shouldn't be.
[36:52.51]Frames, frames.
[36:53.23]You know what I mean?
[36:56.65]My frames are alright.
[36:57.21]What are you on about?
[37:03.48]It's fine now.
[37:04.18]I got a 3090.
[37:04.48]Should I turn the graphics down?
[37:07.02]Maybe it's just too much.
[37:08.36]Oh, well, I'm playing on... Yeah, I don't think this game is designed to be played on Ultra.
[37:11.38]Probably better.
[37:18.80]Oh, what's up?
[37:20.00]Oh, right.
[37:20.72]If you'd like to use the computer, let me know.
[37:24.46]Let me accept this request.
[37:27.04]And then I'm going to get a... I got to get a table.
[37:30.99]30 minutes.
[37:31.21]Go ahead.
[37:32.89]I didn't know what to say.
[37:33.73]Alright.
[37:34.47]Leave.
[37:36.13]I want... Are you going to pay?
[37:41.17]Customer runs away without paying.
[37:47.54]You don't really seem to be running.
[37:51.40]What do I do?
[37:52.52]Give me that money back.
[37:55.74]Um... I didn't... Just pay me the money!
[38:00.74]How do I get the money back?
[38:05.98]Alright, I'll just... Why are we fighting out here?
[38:12.49]Oh god, I'm getting my ass kicked!
[38:14.55]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out!
[38:16.53]Can I use this?
[38:19.11]Oh shit!
[38:19.69]Did I get it?
[38:20.77]Two bucks.
[38:21.16]Alright.
[38:21.52]Somebody help her up.
[38:22.86]Somebody help her.
[38:29.64]All that for two dollars.
[38:30.72]That was not worth fighting over.
[38:34.08]That was not worth a fight.
[38:35.28]It really wasn't.
[38:38.73]I was gonna die.
[38:39.53]I need a table.
[38:51.96]Why does the computer keep turning off?
[38:54.92]Cafe's not nice.
[38:55.58]There are zero games you can play.
[38:57.06]LOL.
[38:57.40]So I'm going to walk out without paying.
[38:58.52]Alright, table.
[39:07.77]Desks.
[39:08.79]Does that count?
[39:09.85]You can get VR too?
[39:10.81]Holy shit, I'm invested.
[39:11.69]Basic console table.
[39:14.33]Yeah, I'm running out of money.
[39:19.29]Oh shit, I'm actually running out of money.
[39:20.57]Everybody just comes in here.
[39:27.38]The people that watch porn literally pay the most, so I don't even care anymore.
[39:32.94]Where's my mop?
[39:35.84]You gotta buy the PC games on... Oh, okay.
[39:37.85]Okay.
[39:54.45]There you go.
[39:55.47]Clean this up.
[40:01.69]Don't mind me.
[40:02.58]Don't mind me.
[40:05.52]Just cleaning up the place.
[40:06.84]That's all.
[40:09.76]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[40:14.02]That's not what I was doing.
[40:15.99]I know it looked really, really weird right there.
[40:18.13]I'm not... Okay.
[40:19.43]Yes.
[40:20.43]I'll take that loss.
[40:21.05]I will.
[40:21.89]That's my own fault.
[40:23.63]Oh.
[40:24.96]Finally.
[40:29.75]Oh, yep, yep, yep.
[40:30.41]Hold on.
[40:33.21]Thank you.
[40:33.99]63 bucks.
[40:35.37]Whoa!
[40:38.92]What happened?
[40:39.42]What?
[40:40.70]Why did the computer explode?
[40:52.81]Wait, did that guy overload the computer with porn viruses?
[40:57.87]It was a bomb.
[40:59.07]Oh my god.
[41:05.37]Okay, that was fucking crazy.
[41:07.99]Uh, alright.
[41:11.31]Um, what do I do?
[41:15.64]Um, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[41:16.86]Is it all broken?
[41:22.91]Does it still work?
[41:24.79]Oh, it still works.
[41:25.33]Alright.
[41:25.81]What?
[41:28.97]No wonder the guy paid me 60 bucks.
[41:32.88]He fucking blew up the computer.
[41:35.40]I like that narrative better.
[41:36.64]That's funnier to me.
[41:37.76]Then the guy came in and blew it up.
[41:40.44]Alright.
[41:41.68]Let's put this over here.
[41:42.96]Maybe like in the edge over here?
[41:49.76]Right here.
[42:04.63]This is so cramped.
[42:08.95]Squid game.
[42:11.61]Why can't I put this here?
[42:17.66]Is that not... I can't... I need a TV?
[42:19.90]How is this not a TV?
[42:20.74]Alright, we'll dual monitor setup over here.
[42:25.98]Imagine doing a dual monitor with a CRT.
[42:31.79]I can't do that.
[42:40.56]Whatever.
[42:42.56]Alright, now I need to get a... Can I sell that thing?
[42:46.70]People actually do that.
[42:49.70]Do they really?
[42:50.14]Alright, I need to get an actual TV.
[43:00.07]TV.
[43:00.13]TV.
[43:02.13]Okay, dude, that's... These are so expensive.
[43:07.59]These are the only TVs I can buy?
[43:08.89]That's annoying.
[43:17.46]I'll just wait until I have money.
[43:19.88]30 minutes.
[43:27.59]Unlock.
[43:30.80]Get some damn game.
[43:31.60]Oh shit, that's right.
[43:32.26]Okay, how do I do those?
[43:34.22]Where do I get those from?
[43:34.98]Dude, get a TV.
[43:40.30]Alright.
[43:44.00]Where do I go?
[43:46.26]Buy some games.
[43:47.10]Build root slots?
[43:49.26]Skin case?
[43:51.20]Apps?
[43:53.74]Steam.
[43:54.58]A platform where you can buy the best quality games.
[43:56.20]Alright, download.

[45:07.92]Why does it say he didn't pay?
[45:16.09]You didn't turn his PC on.
[45:17.57]What?
[45:22.01]He didn't do anything?
[45:22.89]Why was he here for so long?
[45:24.19]That's horseshit.

[47:50.51]This is stressing me out.
[47:51.69]You're alright.
[47:53.75]Computers are 20 years behind technology.
[47:55.47]The cafe's not nice.
[47:56.29]There are zero games.
[47:57.01]I was peeing on my pants.
[47:57.97]It would be great if there was a toilet.
[48:00.93]Where would I put that?
[48:01.69]Nobody pissed they have pants over there?
[48:09.23]Who pissed they have pants?
[48:12.57]Well, I guess I'll take care of it.

[54:58.96]What is going on?
[55:09.91]Remember, you're in it too.
[55:11.03]I am not in this game.
[55:13.65]I'm definitely not in it.
[55:25.32]Okay.
[55:29.00]What does that do?
[55:31.66]Alright.
[55:39.30]So now the game is saved.
[55:44.86]Very cool.
[55:48.58]I'm not smoking, no, not before work.
[55:56.57]What's on floor two?
[55:57.33]I haven't even looked.
[55:57.89]Do you think Jeremiah is going to read this?
[56:05.15]Absolutely.
[56:12.82]Alright, back to work.
[56:23.82]Alright, I gotta get to my cafe.
[56:26.24]Is this pre-recorded?
[56:28.96]No!
[56:32.74]Oh, by the way.
[56:34.51]By the way.
[56:35.11]I can give you a hard date now, I think.
[56:41.32]I think I can give you a hard date on a big stream.
[56:46.20]So I said it was going to be somewhere in the end of January, maybe.
[56:49.05]I hope Community Jake does not want to strangle me after saying this.
[56:54.97]But I believe we can say that February 1st, I would be here if you want to see a big stream.
[57:01.66]I'm not going to tell you what it is.
[57:04.04]Wait, turn electricity on.
[57:07.70]Is it going to be special guests?
[57:09.76]Confirmed.
[57:12.03]It's going to be interesting.
[57:13.79]I will tell you right now.
[57:16.18]I'm not going to say shit.
[57:17.10]I will keep reminding you.
[57:19.28]But this might be my top three favorite streams I've ever done.
[57:23.62]Without a doubt.
[57:24.60]Maybe even top two.
[57:28.23]I don't know.
[57:28.87]It's looking like it could be a really fun time.
[57:41.87]Am I invited?
[57:42.45]Of course you're invited to watch the stream on February 1st.
[57:44.68]Alright, I gotta open this door.
[57:52.22]Open.
[57:52.84]I keep hitting escape and I'm stupid.
[57:54.10]Let's go ahead and open.
[57:58.50]How am I gonna reliably make any money?
[58:05.45]I have $130.
[58:12.65]When are you going to do the naked ketchup bath stream?
[58:18.98]That'd be so weird.
[58:20.02]What are you talking?
[58:25.40]Good afternoon.
[58:26.76]Welcome to EXP and Espresso.
[58:30.02]Can I get you an espresso?
[58:33.88]We don't have that yet.
[58:36.12]We will, though.
[58:36.78]It's part of the plan.
[58:38.62]Limitless.
[58:39.18]This guy's going to be here all day.
[58:42.44]Oh, hell yeah.
[58:48.59]It's clean.
[58:53.75]How does it smell in here?
[58:56.13]It smells pretty good.
[58:57.05]I thought something was riding on top of the dog.
[59:05.93]This guy wants to be in here all day.
[59:07.42]That's good on me.
[59:14.40]Should I pay the guy $100 just to get another quest or something?
[59:23.60]Bat to the back of the guy's head.
[59:24.70]Alright, I'm just gonna do it.
[59:27.66]Here.
[59:28.62]Drop by me from time to time.
[59:30.56]We seem to get along well with you.
[59:31.66]Now you can buy BTC Miner if you want.
[59:33.58]I only have $30.
[59:35.02]Excuse me?
[59:43.96]I'm sorry.
[59:51.82]I'm such like a fan.
[60:04.35]He's been here for a long time.
[60:09.55]I hope this guy gives me like 200 bucks.
[60:15.28]Can I do anything else here?
[60:16.22]Can I make any money?
[60:19.15]My cafe.
[60:20.69]This is all too expensive.
[60:23.03]Alright, crypto.
[60:26.01]I... I don't have enough money to do any of this.
[60:32.34]Buying and selling crypto.

[61:04.25]You own zero Warcry coin.
[61:06.19]A hundred Warcry coin is ten dollars.
[61:08.87]Convert the coins you earn in Warcry into real money.
[61:13.07]You better not fucking leave without paying.
[61:18.12]He was in here for like six hours.
[61:24.46]It was a hundred bucks.
[61:25.44]Got it.

[68:09.86]Okay.
[68:11.73]Remember, this place sucks.
[68:14.01]I just opened it.
[68:14.91]I'm trying to get some money.
[68:16.07]Once I get to a thousand bucks, I can buy... Because of the virus?
[68:25.54]The virus.
[68:27.50]Yeah, maybe it's all the porn you've all been watching.
[68:29.48]Okay, where's my virus again?
[68:35.14]Uh, where is it?
[68:36.08]Let me spin this first.
[68:42.87]Okay, apps.
[68:45.47]Virus.
[68:46.27]Where is it?
[68:47.83]Oh, there it is.
[68:49.47]The number of computers connected to the network are two.
[68:50.99]Start a scan.
[68:55.47]The number of viruses?
[68:56.99]46 viruses?
[69:00.96]This reminds me of when...
[69:04.58]I would be at a grandparent's house.
[69:07.36]And you'd run.
[69:08.12]They'd be like, oh, yeah, you could use my computer.
[69:11.43]If you need to use a computer at a grandparent's.
[69:13.53]Oh yeah, the computer's upstairs, sweetheart.
[69:15.65]Yeah, it works.
[69:17.03]I've got Microsoft on there.
[69:19.79]And they don't even ask you to do this, but you just do it because you're just going to.
[69:24.74]Half because you're curious and half because they don't know what the fuck's going on.
[69:28.24]You just run malware bytes or like Windows Defender on their computer just because.
[69:34.58]It's just the first thing you do.
[69:36.60]And I remember I did that one time and I think there was, I'm not kidding, there was probably like thousands of like adware and shit like that on it.
[69:44.41]And you don't even tell them you're doing it either.
[69:46.97]That conversation does not even need to happen.
[69:51.04]Because they would... Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[70:00.76]Speaking of, like, overacting.
[70:05.20]That was, like, the ultimate overacting.
[70:07.93]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[70:09.31]I got hit by the shell in Mario Kart.
[70:14.38]If I had- If I did voice lines from Mario Kart, like- That- Me- I just got hit by a fucking trap thing.
[70:29.20]Why do they- Okay, how do I stop that from happening?
[70:30.94]Why do they keep doing that?
[70:36.46]Why- Like, why are they, like, coming here and, like, blowing up the- Why are they doing this?
[70:43.24]Jerma, please apologize to my girlfriend.
[70:46.67]After your thief stream, I told her you'd be playing Everhood on Wednesday, and we were very excited, but here we are, and there's no Everhood.
[70:51.97]I know.
[70:52.17]I'm sorry.
[70:52.47]I lied about it.
[70:53.55]I'm sorry.
[70:59.12]I'm actually sorry.
[70:59.98]I did say I was going to play.
[71:01.04]I did say I was going to play Everhood.
[71:03.66]It didn't end up happening.
[71:06.24]Very sorry about that.
[71:08.46]I kind of had a headache earlier.
[71:10.04]I feel like that was not the kind of game to play with a headache.
[71:12.32]I will play Everhood.
[71:13.44]You can be rest assured.
[71:14.46]I must throw up.
[71:18.62]At some point, I will play Everhood.
[71:26.62]I'm so sorry.
[71:27.96]I'm really nervous.
[71:28.70]I'm so sorry.
[71:29.34]What was that?
[71:43.10]We just laughed.
[71:43.66]That was weird.
[71:44.12]Okay, how much money do I have?
[71:48.44]How long does it take to do virus shit?
[71:53.41]Did they get it?
[71:53.95]Or did the explosion screw this up?
[72:07.53]Did the explosion mess it up?
[72:08.81]Don't even tell me that's what happened.
[72:13.34]Okay, 324.
[72:14.28]Treasure hunt.
[72:21.94]Get more... No more keys left.
[72:23.64]One key is... Okay, so I'm gonna buy five keys.
[72:27.90]What do you think, guys?
[72:28.46]Top right?
[72:33.60]Good call.
[72:37.24]Right in the middle?
[72:40.25]Eh, guys, come on.
[72:41.85]Middle left?
[72:44.31]Okay.
[72:47.07]Center left.
[72:47.67]Yeah.
[72:48.67]Middle right.
[72:51.11]Oh, man.
[72:51.63]This is a bit of bad... Bad choices.
[72:54.11]Bottom left.
[72:54.64]It's okay.
[72:56.70]Alright, what else we got?
[73:01.46]I didn't do lucky wheel.
[73:02.24]I want to try it.
[73:02.68]How do I do it?
[73:11.20]I'll spin.
[73:11.60]Fifteen.
[73:17.36]Alright, do it again.
[73:21.38]Marine is the most expensive, it seems, right?
[73:22.82]Alright, actually the final one and I'm not doing this ever again.
[73:33.24]Alright, that's it.
[73:39.41]Cash out.
[73:41.93]We got 177 worth.
[73:46.55]I just keep ending up with the same amount that I came in with.
[73:51.42]What about this Warcry coin thing?
[73:56.64]Stop turning the electricity off, whoever's doing that.
[74:03.05]Is there a reason why no one's coming in?
[74:10.23]Turn the Warcraft game into real money.
[74:12.62]Hold on, how do I do that?
[74:22.73]PC is not assembled.
[74:27.13]Apps.
[74:29.25]Employ.
[74:29.65]Data so we can find some employees.
[74:31.65]Warcry.
[74:32.25]There it is.
[74:34.17]World's greatest MMO game.
[74:35.53]Download now and start earning real money.
[74:37.47]Alright, that's downloading.
[74:45.35]Is it really not assembled?
[74:49.39]Oh, that's why.
[74:50.13]Okay, that's stupid.
[74:59.31]Are we clean, though?
[75:00.25]I think so.
[75:03.46]Chair.
[75:03.88]Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot.
[75:05.18]I got it.
[75:12.38]I'm gonna sell this.
[75:13.08]We're closed for a minute.
[75:23.63]Uh, secondhand shop right here.
[75:28.58]Hey!
[75:29.08]What?
[75:29.44]You're being searched for what?
[75:30.70]What?
[75:30.96]What's going on?
[75:31.68]What's happening?
[75:33.42]Why am I being searched?
[75:36.52]You've been fined for not obeying police stop warning.
[75:39.40]What the hell are you talking about?
[75:40.72]What?
[75:43.52]I'm walking down the street with my computer monitor to sell to the secondhand shop.
[75:48.56]What do you mean by that?
[75:50.24]What did I do?
[75:50.66]I got something for you.
[76:00.22]I literally stopped when he said stop.
[76:15.59]Don't even think about it.
[76:22.30]Alright, do I have enough to buy a monitor?
[76:24.02]Oh wait, I can play that game.
[76:30.04]I have a bill due.
[76:32.32]Please stop penalty.
[76:34.05]Come on.
[76:34.83]Oh, fuck off.
[76:38.33]Okay, how do I play it?
[76:41.65]Warcry Classic.
[76:43.11]Start game.
[76:48.79]What?
[76:53.93]Interact.
[76:57.30]What is this?
[77:02.03]Interact.
[77:03.15]Sell item.
[77:05.15]What is this?
[77:05.83]Actually, you can play this?
[77:12.25]These guys are level 12?
[77:13.36]How am I supposed to kill these?
[77:14.24]They sound like something.
[77:19.12]What do they sound like?
[77:21.78]Oh my god, what is it?
[77:29.71]Heart of Darkness.
[77:31.67]That game for PlayStation 1.
[77:32.37]How many coins do I get?
[77:46.61]This hurts my head looking at this.
[77:54.08]Can I do another move?
[77:59.90]Has anybody come into this restaurant yet?
[78:01.78]Okay, open.
[78:11.14]What?
[78:17.45]I can't open- open it!
[78:21.39]Open this!
[78:21.91]There's nothing even in these.
[78:29.19]This guy has a quest?
[78:31.91]Upgrade item.
[78:34.61]Why?
[78:34.91]I don't even have any money.
[78:36.01]The loot despawned.
[78:46.98]What level are these guys?
[78:47.78]1?
[78:47.96]Level 2.
[78:49.82]Alright.
[79:01.31]Dude, why is there nothing in these?
[79:08.29]Finally, what is it?
[79:09.27]Jello?
[79:09.61]Free game.
[79:14.52]No complaining.
[79:15.24]It's a free game.
[79:20.62]You don't have the season pass.
[79:21.66]Is this a health?
[79:26.71]Oh, that's a health potion.
[79:27.65]Okay.
[79:32.95]Are you going to stream the new War Crime expansion?
[79:38.72]I'm actually not that happy with the direction that the devs have taken it.
[79:44.84]The amount of damage that it used to... They changed the scaling on damage.
[79:48.74]At least, that's their plan.
[79:52.78]I've been playing this game since 2013 or something.
[79:56.83]As somebody who's been playing it for a while, it sucks.
[80:00.43]It's probably a good excuse for me to stop playing it.
[80:05.36]This is my... I mean, we're in the starter zone for the new guys watching, but this is probably my, like, 40th or 50th character.
[80:11.34]That's probably a good idea, but I'm going to try something else.
[80:18.05]If they end up fixing it, though, I'll probably come back.
[80:25.47]Yeah, the change in bag slots, too, which is...
[80:29.62]I mean, I love this dev team and shit, so I don't really want to talk that deeply about it.
[80:34.88]And to kind of be overly, I would say, I don't want to be mean or anything.
[80:39.97]Because I truly love this game and I love the community and everything.
[80:44.53]But I don't know if the new lead director needs to get more input from the fans and stuff.
[80:51.76]But I'm just not fucking happy with it.
[80:59.72]I'm going to sell these, though.
[81:12.13]Worst joke taking more than five minutes.
[81:14.15]It's only been 30 seconds.
[81:18.25]Wrap it up.
[81:19.59]Alright, alright.
[81:20.61]Wrap it up, Jeremy.
[81:22.35]Wrap it up.
[81:23.90]Alright, alright.
[81:24.72]Wrap it up.
[81:29.54]This felt like two hours.
[81:30.60]Oh, stop.
[81:31.90]Please, get out of there.
[81:36.50]I'm trying to pass the time so I can sell.
[81:38.47]By the way, is anybody even in the fucking store?
[81:44.41]Why is nobody in here?
[81:45.25]Has electricity been off?
[81:47.33]Oh, no!
[81:47.99]My progress!
[81:49.45]Shit!
[81:52.43]No!
[82:03.46]I'm sitting at one... Oh, thank God.
[82:06.23]Thank God.
[82:06.89]Okay.
[82:07.65]Devs did something right.
[82:19.43]Auto save.
[82:24.32]Okay.
[82:25.34]This is actually kind of hard to control, I'll be honest.
[82:27.38]I'll be honest.
[82:31.46]Open it.
[82:37.56]Alright, I'm turning this stuff in.
[82:38.64]I'm done.
[82:45.31]Okay.
[82:46.17]Can I use this to craft or something?
[82:49.39]Upgrade.
[82:50.43]Belt.
[82:51.09]No, it just costs coins.
[82:51.91]Let's sell.
[82:56.66]Um, um, hello?
[82:58.46]What the fuck?
[82:58.86]Where's the booty bay guards?
[83:00.24]Where's the booty bay guards?
[83:01.14]What the fuck is going on here?
[83:02.08]Where are the guards?
[83:12.25]What the fuck was that?
[83:13.05]How much do I get?
[83:18.41]I have only 34 coins.
[83:25.90]What can I do with these?
[83:26.76]Can I even turn these in?
[83:33.77]How do I get, like, what do I do?
[83:34.55]How do I get out of this?
[83:38.65]Oh, okay.
[83:39.03]Okay.
[83:40.58]So now I go to Warcry coin.
[83:45.76]It's only $10 to convert 100 of those coins.
[83:53.32]I'm never opening that ever again.
[83:56.33]$433.
[83:56.37]Why is nobody coming to the store?
[83:59.01]Oh my fucking god.
[84:05.91]It really wasn't open.
[84:06.71]You guys weren't kidding?
[84:07.37]It's alright.
[84:10.61]Whatever.
[84:12.43]Just gamble instead?
[84:13.33]Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[84:21.49]That's not a bad idea.
[84:25.14]The monitor's not connected?
[84:26.00]Yeah, it is.
[84:29.50]I know the controller's on the ground somewhere.
[84:30.94]Where is it?
[84:31.24]Hey, what the hell are you doing?
[84:34.42]What are you doing?
[84:36.09]What are you doing?
[84:41.04]Give me that back.
[84:41.44]What is that?
[84:51.08]Wait, I heard that laugh before.
[84:58.95]Oh, you idiot.
[84:59.75]Why?
[85:00.85]Stupid.
[85:05.43]Did he take the controller?
[85:06.47]No, I think it's on the ground over there.
[85:18.26]Get it flush.
[85:19.54]Thank you.
[85:19.96]Clean this up.
[85:25.04]I only have room for two things anyways in this damn place.
[85:27.20]Whatever.
[85:27.48]Did he steal the other monitor?
[85:30.22]No, I sold it.
[85:31.48]I got rid of it.
[85:31.88]Alright.
[85:35.60]And the tower.
[85:36.20]Where is it?
[85:36.66]There it is.
[85:41.84]Okay.
[85:41.94]I need... Please decorate.
[85:46.99]I don't have any money.
[85:51.05]I'm going to gamble $200, and then whatever happens from that, we'll smoosh it into decorating.
[86:02.83]I saw that guy's back.
[86:10.38]No, he's not.
[86:10.68]Alright, I thought I saw him sneaking by.
[86:16.32]Don't even think about it.
[86:17.80]Alright, he's not here.
[86:20.97]Alright, what do you say we, uh, do a little gambling?
[86:23.45]Why not?
[86:23.77]Should I buy a case?
[86:33.64]I'm gonna buy a best case for $300.
[86:36.70]Alright, come on.
[86:42.52]Any of these good?
[86:43.82]I got two knives.
[86:44.46]Those are two knives.
[86:45.66]That's worth like $1,000.
[86:46.08]I just won.
[86:46.54]I just won the game.
[86:48.91]There's literally two knives in here.
[86:51.56]What do I do?
[86:51.84]One hundred and six... Wait.
[86:56.69]Do I sell this?
[86:58.59]What's happening?
[87:00.77]What do I do?
[87:04.25]What do I do?
[87:19.32]Excuse-
[87:22.80]Hey, what's up, man?
[87:24.24]How you doing?
[87:25.20]Good to see you.
[87:25.62]Good to see you.
[87:25.96]Yeah, I just opened up this cafe and I'm good to see you.
[87:31.83]I've got games for you if you're really ready to go.
[87:34.59]I've got a... We've got... You can check out whatever we got on the thing over there.
[87:39.97]Just take a look.
[87:41.81]I can get you situated.
[87:43.06]I can get you the whole package.
[87:44.10]It's going in right now.
[87:46.42]Yeah, 30 minutes is fine.
[87:47.22]If you want to stay for like an hour, you can.
[87:49.22]I don't give a shit.
[87:49.70]You know what I mean?
[87:50.76]You can just stick around.
[87:52.94]An hour or two hours, it don't matter.
[88:03.40]Oh, no.
[88:05.86]Oh, no.
[88:10.84]I mean... You know, I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna look the other way on this one.
[88:17.95]I'm gonna look over here.
[88:27.99]Hold on, hold on.
[88:28.63]Let me get up.
[88:29.09]I gotta get up from the seat.
[88:30.75]Thank you.
[88:31.37]No, no, no.
[88:32.69]I'll take the money.
[88:33.28]I'll take the money, please.
[88:34.08]No way.
[88:35.06]He's leaving without paying.
[88:38.22]I don't... I was... It was my fault.
[88:40.54]I'm sorry.
[88:41.10]I should have actually put my hand out and then taken that money from you.
[88:44.16]You know, let's just call it even.
[88:45.92]It was really great to see you.
[88:47.24]If you ever want to come back, by all means, we love having content creators come over and check out our stuff.
[88:53.51]And yeah, I mean, we could just say that this was kind of like a little collaboration and it was really good to have you.
[89:00.69]If you could tell people about us and maybe you come back next time and maybe we have a good time.
[89:24.40]Okay, we're open.
[89:35.12]Pet the cat?
[89:35.84]Okay.
[89:38.11]-2.
[89:38.67]You should have hit him.
[89:39.89]No.
[89:41.71]I can't.
[89:43.60]How do you pet cat?
[89:49.00]I mean, this, I know, like, it's like, oh, he's gonna left click.
[89:51.22]I'm not.
[89:51.66]I'm not gonna punch this cat.
[89:59.53]Oh, check his review.
[90:00.77]Yeah, what did he say?
[90:02.27]Let's see.
[90:09.34]If more beautiful girls come, I'll increase the score.
[90:11.84]He gave me five stars.
[90:15.99]That's pretty good, I think.
[90:16.95]That's not bad.
[90:19.01]That's not bad.
[90:21.17]Wait, does that imply that if there was more porn?
[90:24.47]If I had more porn?
[90:27.84]Oh, man.
[90:43.26]I need to get to downloading.
[90:47.81]I- can I- how do I uninstall this?
[90:51.55]Alright, so now... 290- wait!
[90:57.13]Right.
[90:58.01]So how do I get- I have like all these skins and shit.
[91:01.71]I have a knife?
[91:03.88]Can I sell these?
[91:04.70]Do I have an inventory or something?
[91:12.98]I only got one.
[91:13.74]This is it?
[91:14.66]Where is it?
[91:17.33]Wait, what?
[91:18.55]It only gives you the one... How do I sell it?
[91:26.95]I already got the money for it?
[91:30.13]No way.
[91:35.29]Oh, shit.
[91:35.77]Alright.
[91:43.33]Alright, I just got fucking absolutely annihilated.
[91:45.57]Alright, I'm done.
[91:48.99]I'm done.
[91:49.77]That's it.
[91:50.65]No more.
[92:07.99]Oh, what's he playing?
[92:10.95]He's playing Half-Life.
[92:13.29]He wants more time.
[92:14.03]You got it.
[92:22.46]He's playing a game, so this is going to be worth more money.
[92:26.20]Alright, what's this whole... I actually have to stop messing around.
[92:30.72]I keep just blowing my money and gambling.
[92:39.57]In an arcade machine, they generate a ton of money.
[92:43.70]Okay.
[92:43.90]Alright, actually no more gambling.
[92:48.42]I don't want to do that anymore.
[92:49.78]It's stupid.
[92:50.40]What about food?
[92:50.90]Vending machine?
[92:55.33]This game's kind of cool.
[92:58.59]I need to restart.
[92:59.77]I don't think so.
[93:00.35]I have 440 bucks.
[93:05.96]I screwed up because I bought a bunch of console stuff and I thought I could just put a TV on it.
[93:09.12]Or a monitor.
[93:09.72]Okay.
[93:17.24]There's actually a lot of stuff.
[93:18.93]I'm very interested.
[93:20.17]This is a lot of fun.
[93:22.45]Let's cope.
[93:23.03]Let's not cope.
[93:24.09]I like the game.
[93:24.59]I need to wait until he's done.
[93:36.95]So what should I...
[93:40.38]I have no bills I have to pay.
[93:41.48]Alright, he wants to pay.
[93:43.06]Let's go.
[93:44.42]That was an expensive experience, wasn't it?
[93:47.32]79 bucks.
[93:52.03]It seems fun in a dumb way.
[93:53.37]It's just... Alright.
[93:55.51]Alright.
[94:01.01]Gamble on the fruit slots.
[94:04.50]I would have so much more money if we didn't do any of that.
[94:09.64]Alright, I'll do it for a minute.
[94:14.35]I was peeing on my pants.
[94:15.59]It would be great if there was a toilet.
[94:18.55]By the way, if more beautiful girls come, I'll increase the score.
[94:21.05]How do you increase the score over five stars?
[94:26.65]You really kind of don't.
[94:31.20]Excuse me.
[94:32.88]Excuse me.
[94:34.88]No, put that down.
[94:36.20]Excuse me.
[94:47.14]I only did that because she... Run.
[94:50.26]Are we open?
[95:06.25]Okay.
[95:16.70]$20 bet for a spin.
[95:18.84]$20 bet.
[95:19.92]What am I even looking at here?
[95:30.26]What are the lines?
[95:31.60]Buy a free spin for $2,000.
[95:32.86]What a rip-off.
[95:38.63]I'm not going to hit anything at all.
[95:46.01]Oh.
[95:49.79]Yeah, I got you.
[95:54.36]Hold on.
[95:56.52]Um... What the hell?
[96:00.30]Alright, what's that worth?
[96:10.44]This thing sucks!
[96:22.09]What do these do?
[96:23.07]What?
[96:23.35]That strawberry is right there.
[96:28.88]How is that not a line?
[96:31.14]How is this not a line?
[96:39.38]Come on.
[96:39.76]Come on.
[96:41.98]Alright.
[96:42.56]That's going to be worth like 100 bucks.
[96:43.38]How much was that?
[96:54.65]What are you doing?
[97:02.01]Thanks for coming.
[97:03.51]50 bucks.
[97:03.81]Alright, no more gambling.
[97:05.49]Do a virus scan, please.
[97:06.55]What time is it right now?
[97:14.67]1?
[97:15.09]No new customers come after 1 o'clock.
[97:16.67]Alright, so let's close.
[97:30.38]Fucking goddamn virus skin.
[97:31.62]Do the claw machine one more time.
[97:42.15]I need to buy an arcade machine.
[97:43.35]I don't have... Dude, I gotta tell you up front here.
[97:48.55]Every time that we get more than $400, I go back to zero.
[97:53.35]I wish it was warmer.
[97:54.17]Yeah, so do I. It's January, though.
[98:05.68]Did I buy more of these?
[98:06.44]I guess I'm just gonna sit in here all night and play Warcry Classic.
[98:17.77]Oh, right, the virus skin.
[98:22.39]You can't even get past 300 bucks without gambling it away.
[98:25.92]I promise I am not going to spend a single solitary cent until we get to enough money where I can put it on that console table.
[98:37.85]I'm not going to spend another dime.
[98:40.17]Not one dime.
[98:42.85]Make a prediction.
[98:43.85]Go for it.
[98:44.17]You guys want to bet on that?
[98:46.25]I will not spend another dollar until I have enough to buy a TV for that console.
[98:51.42]The PlayStation 1 over there on the table.
[98:56.58]Make a prediction.
[98:59.62]Trust me.
[99:00.10]I got it.
[99:00.66]I got this.
[99:06.82]I feel like this would be pretty, um... be pretty trivial in a few hours.
[99:12.13]Alright, it's doing it.
[99:14.65]Just don't turn the electricity off.
[99:18.81]Clean this place up.
[99:19.41]It's a little dirty.
[99:24.89]Yeah, I'm not gonna spend any money, I promise.
[99:49.21]I'm going to tell you guys right now, if you bet against that, you're going to lose.
[99:55.09]If you say, no, I will not be able to avoid spending, you're going to lose.
[100:05.16]The controller's still on the floor.
[100:06.94]Well, yeah, because I... No, I can't really do anything with it now.
[100:10.36]I need a TV.
[100:15.84]What about if you get fined?
[100:16.75]No, that does not count.
[100:20.67]It only counts if I physically spend the money.
[100:23.43]Not something that I have to pay.
[100:25.41]Like bills or the police fine or something.
[100:28.61]No.
[100:28.95]It has to be I spend it.
[100:30.38]Like I go, oh, I'm going to buy this or I'm going to gamble.
[100:37.60]Well, it doesn't count.
[100:44.90]Hundreds of viruses.
[100:49.74]There we go.
[100:50.38]Cool.
[100:50.72]Alright.
[100:52.12]It's a new day.
[100:52.72]I haven't slept in probably three.
[100:55.92]So let's just relax and go forward.
[100:58.42]Right?
[100:59.42]Just relax.
[101:00.96]Shut up.
[101:02.04]Shut the fuck up.
[101:03.63]All of you.
[101:05.15]And let's go from here.
[101:13.95]I'm gonna put this in a better place.
[101:15.97]Like, in the corner.
[101:17.53]So I know exactly where it is at all times.
[101:29.56]Alright.
[101:30.68]Let's go.
[101:32.52]Open the store.
[101:36.63]Open for business.
[101:38.69]$92.
[101:39.19]Come on in.
[101:40.59]Maybe there's a quest or something I can do.
[101:43.79]Adjust the prices.
[101:45.15]Should I just make it really expensive and get a bunch of bad ratings and who cares?
[101:49.25]Do I really care that much?
[102:00.16]One point... One point three.
[102:03.18]Hello!
[102:08.16]Yep, that'll be... Computer number one.
[102:11.37]I've got you.
[102:11.93]Is she naked?
[102:18.03]No.
[102:18.17]What?
[102:18.33]What are you talking about?
[102:21.69]She's watching, um... Stock footage.
[102:29.71]Or...
[102:31.46]The beginning of every YouTuber video you've ever watched in your whole life.
[102:37.16]Anytime any YouTuber has ever gone anywhere in their entire life has been this shot.
[102:41.83]Every time.
[102:42.15]The only thing that's missing is the plane.
[102:46.67]The plane wing out the window.
[102:48.19]The plane wing.
[102:54.84]Have I ever done that?
[103:00.20]Have I ever done the, I'm going on a trip, I'm filming out the plane window?
[103:05.11]Have I ever done that?
[103:06.01]I don't think I have.
[103:06.63]Don't you think we count funny?
[103:18.37]What if I made a video?
[103:19.97]And, hold on.
[103:21.32]Thank you.
[103:23.56]What if I made a video where it was just like me introducing that like, hey guys, going on this big trip.
[103:28.62]It's gonna be so much fun and we'll see ya.
[103:31.28]And it's just like four minutes of planes taking off and landing out the window.
[103:38.87]It's just, it's just like that.
[103:40.27]I'm going up out the window.
[103:46.09]And then it, like, it cuts to me, like, holding, like, a drink on the plane, like, mmm, and looking in the camera.
[103:51.27]Why is the computer off?
[104:03.45]You already made this years ago?
[104:04.89]What?
[104:08.56]Just upload the whole flight.
[104:09.83]Yeah.
[104:10.91]It's like... Out the window.
[104:15.71]And then it's just... And you're just sitting there in the seat.
[104:23.47]Just sitting there like looking around.
[104:25.13]It's like a six hour, seven hour video.
[104:34.86]Are you shifting around and, like, stretching your back?
[104:37.48]You get up to take, like, a piss and it's just still sitting where the seat is?
[104:43.06]Oh, no.
[104:43.34]Don't make it a time lapse.
[104:46.36]Wait.
[104:46.60]Somebody want to... Shit.
[104:47.62]I wasn't paying attention.
[104:49.28]Is he doing that for free?
[105:01.19]I should buy a monitor.
[105:02.09]I'm waiting till I can afford it.
[105:07.71]It's open.
[105:11.78]It's true, yeah.
[105:12.92]Have it be the whole flight is the video.
[105:16.96]And then at the very end, it's just like, you get off the plane, and it gets into like a, like, oh, I'm in the Uber!
[105:23.99]Oh, here we go!
[105:24.75]And it cuts to like, I'm in the hotel!
[105:26.21]And you see like in the top right, like a battery is like blinking.
[105:31.02]And it just cuts and the video ends.
[105:37.40]Yep.
[105:47.12]Then the next video is you're getting on another plane.
[105:56.19]The dollhouse behind the scenes starts with an airplane window shot.
[106:03.49]It does...
[106:13.98]Does it actually?
[106:14.68]Let me see.
[106:23.62]Let's investigate this.
[106:29.13]I want to see.
[106:30.69]No, it doesn't.
[106:36.93]Where?
[106:37.17]At the very beginning?
[106:45.56]I don't listen to that.
[106:52.28]It does.
[106:52.62]Oh fuck, it actually does.
[106:53.88]Let me see.
[106:57.76]It doesn't, right?
[107:14.95]It does?
[107:15.41]Oh, hold on.
[107:21.13]It doesn't.
[107:21.61]That doesn't count.
[107:22.81]That doesn't count.
[107:23.57]That's a plane landing.
[107:24.73]That's not a plane out the window with the wing going up.
[107:29.07]It's got the right music though.
[107:30.56]It has the right music.
[107:31.94]I will give you that.
[107:32.56]It's the correct music.
[107:34.12]That doesn't count.
[107:34.68]It's a plane.
[107:35.14]It's a plane going down.
[107:36.36]It's not like plane going up.
[107:37.56]It counts.
[107:38.00]It does.
[107:38.92]Sure.
[107:40.84]Yeah, it counts.
[107:41.36]Fine.
[107:41.90]Okay.
[107:56.07]I have not been paying attention at all.
[107:57.35]Is this person still here?
[107:58.21]Yeah, it counts.
[108:02.96]That's fine.
[108:08.04]Okay, $214.
[108:08.34]How long until the prediction ends?
[108:15.92]Until I either spend money on something I'm not supposed to, or I buy the thing that I'm supposed to buy.
[108:26.03]What can I do for you?
[108:31.90]Can I change my desktop background?
[108:38.16]Do a quest.
[108:39.18]I don't want to just leave.
[108:41.84]I did, like, the Bitcoin quest.
[108:43.13]And the guy was like, hey, come to my Bitcoin store.
[108:45.71]And I never even went.
[108:46.75]And that's the only quest I had.
[108:47.77]Another customer?
[108:55.35]Thank you.
[108:59.50]What can I get for desktop wallpapers?
[109:01.18]Can you actually get them?
[109:02.36]I want something better.
[109:02.88]I almost just clicked that.
[109:07.52]Alright, where do I... Okay, bill, mail, clothes.
[109:10.86]Where do I get it?
[109:11.34]I was peeing.
[109:20.13]It smells disgusting.
[109:24.61]I'm going home to pee.
[109:28.70]How would you go home?
[109:35.44]Okay.
[109:38.55]How am I supposed to get a bathroom?
[109:49.34]Well, stop pissing on the ground.
[109:51.10]Maybe that would be an easy way to make it so it doesn't smell in here anymore.
[110:01.45]You can expand the store.
[110:02.33]Let me... I need to have more than one person here at a time.
[110:15.59]Is there a bunch of viruses on this thing again?
[110:18.05]There's so many viruses again. ...
[110:36.22]Is it dirty?
[110:37.38]It is.
[110:41.22]Reduce slots.
[110:42.76]No.
[110:43.66]I need a TV, and that's priority number one, because once I get a TV, I can have double the income.
[110:49.17]We're trailing so far behind.
[110:51.05]I've been here for two hours, Jeremy.
[111:00.59]Your excuse was that you just started, but... Pay me.
[111:09.45]No, that's not gonna happen.
[111:12.34]There's the bat.
[111:20.48]Yeah, arrest him.
[111:23.50]What?
[111:24.71]This, the guy just stole from me!
[111:26.77]He just stole from me!
[111:40.80]Oh, fuck!
[111:41.56]I didn't mean to... Holy shit, I didn't mean to hit you.
[111:43.46]I was trying to hit this... Can you please open the image that you had in the very beginning of this one?
[112:08.65]Oh, what about it?
[112:21.30]I didn't spend any money, actually.
[112:22.92]Oh, come on.
[112:27.52]I was right there.
[112:28.08]Pay for what you've done!
[112:35.71]What?
[112:39.31]I didn't spend money.
[112:39.99]I have to pay the fine.
[112:40.97]I haven't paid the fine yet.
[112:44.67]See?
[112:45.89]I have four days to pay $50 penalty.
[112:50.02]I'm not paying it.
[113:05.50]What's up?
[113:13.49]Come on.
[113:19.56]You added the stipulation that it didn't count if you had to pay for it.
[113:22.10]Yeah, that's true.
[113:27.41]But, I mean, I don't want to spend $50 right now if I don't have to.
[113:36.97]Can I even go over to the BTC thing?
[113:43.12]Is that TF Classic?
[113:50.74]It's not enough.
[113:53.67]It is for the quest.
[113:54.71]Alright, but not... I'm rolling along here.
[113:56.97]What time is it?
[114:00.23]Alright, I gotta save the game.
[114:01.33]It's been like an hour and a half.
[114:03.96]Turn the lights off.
[114:07.00]Clean up.
[114:12.94]Close this door.
[114:16.83]Alright.
[114:17.93]I gotta go home and save the game.
[114:42.83]Such a silent... We have such a silent community.
[114:47.69]Silent?
[114:48.13]What do you mean?
[114:52.00]What happened?
[114:59.54]Oh, that's what was happening in the very beginning of the stream.
[115:04.00]I was... I was like, what the hell's happening to me?
[115:05.98]Couldn't go anywhere.
[115:19.05]This isn't Thrillville.
[115:19.93]No.
[115:21.39]It's Internet Cafe Simulator.
[115:30.95]Another day.
[115:31.41]Let's go.
[115:33.21]I'm ready.
[115:41.59]What is that image?
[115:42.40]I don't know.
[115:50.84]Is that burger?

[116:02.66]That's a picture of me.
[116:11.61]That's me.
[116:16.73]It's my face.
[116:34.15]It's supposed to be like this.
[116:36.71]It just looks funny.
[116:39.47]Your mouth looks like Among Us?
[116:41.11]No, it's not supposed to look like that.
[116:48.66]It's me lying down.
[117:05.16]He took a picture after I was like in the head in the back of the head with a bowling pin And I'm on like the ground.
[117:12.18]Oh, I'm sleeping That is not you yes it is I swear to God that's me I
[117:34.56]Do you need more proof?
[117:36.00]It looks nothing like me.
[117:37.98]Prove that that's me!
[117:39.26]There's no way proof- Okay, fine.
[117:41.08]You want proof?
[117:42.04]I'll prove it's me.
[117:42.96]Here we go.

[118:10.42]I'm not naked.
[118:11.00]I don't give a shit.
[118:12.17]Who cares?
[118:12.53]If you really need to... If I need to really prove that that is me lying down in a bed, I will.
[118:23.47]I'm ready.
[118:24.61]I'm ready to leak it.
[118:25.48]Alright, let me just hold on.
[118:36.30]Okay, here comes the leak.
[118:42.04]What did I name it?
[118:42.80]I don't know.
[118:46.84]How can I not save this image?
[118:53.84]Oh, there we go.
[118:54.20]Okay.
[119:03.89]Okay, here it comes.
[119:08.61]I hope it doesn't just show up on the fucking screen.
[119:13.62]Like, let me just... I gotta make sure my dick is not in this or something.
[119:17.55]I have to, like... I gotta, like, literally zoom in and make sure my dick's not in this.
[119:23.41]I think I'm good.
[119:25.20]I'm gonna crop it anyways.
[119:26.00]Alright, I can crop it.
[119:46.12]I gotta do this slowly.
[119:47.26]I gotta do it really slowly to make sure I can, like, I'm not actually, let's see.
[119:52.78]Okay.
[119:55.37]We gotta reveal this slow.
[120:04.47]Alright, not that way.
[120:13.93]Where am I?
[120:16.43]Where the fuck am I?
[120:20.57]Why am I not in this image?
[120:22.69]Oh, wait, hold on.
[120:23.73]What is that?
[120:28.32]What is that?
[120:28.72]Is that a dick?
[120:29.86]It's not, I'm kidding.
[120:34.58]It's not an ass, I swear to God.
[120:37.12]It's not an ass.
[120:38.58]It's not an ass.
[120:40.62]It's not an ass.
[120:43.10]What is that?
[120:43.48]I didn't look.
[120:43.88]What does this picture look like?
[120:45.73]I don't know what that is.
[120:48.17]What is that?
[120:48.71]Is that my stomach?
[120:51.95]Alright.
[120:52.23]Well, I think that's the shoulder.
[120:53.41]I think we're good.
[120:54.85]What is that?
[120:55.47]What is this?
[121:04.67]I swear to God, this is my shoulder.
[121:08.33]This is my shoulder.
[121:09.77]It's just weirdly cropped.
[121:12.39]It's just really weirdly cropped.
[121:14.43]What even?
[121:15.15]Okay, it's because it's somewhere.
[121:17.17]Where's my face?
[121:19.04]That's my outfit.
[121:28.08]There I am.
[121:28.64]There I am.

[121:33.50]There I am.
[121:35.71]What's going on in this picture?
[121:37.07]Why is it like this?
[121:39.93]What the fuck?
[121:44.87]I'm so confused right now.
[121:50.32]There you go.
[121:51.50]I told you it was real.
[121:54.08]I told you.
[121:58.34]It's because it was upside down.
[122:04.61]Show the whole thing?
[122:05.64]No.
[122:07.32]Nice neckbeard.
[122:08.48]Oh my god, it's true.
[122:13.30]I'm gonna die.
[122:15.70]What do you mean that's not me?
[122:17.50]Are you out of your mind?
[122:19.10]How do you not understand?
[122:19.88]That's me.
[122:26.65]Let me, I can flip it.
[122:27.83]Let me flip it the other way so you can see.
[122:31.07]Rotate.
[122:32.35]That's my face.
[122:44.26]See?
[122:45.66]This is me.
[122:48.74]My face.
[122:52.45]Okay.
[123:03.99]Somebody said that's literally your stunt double, dude.
[123:06.38]That can't be you.
[123:07.56]That's me.
[123:09.22]That's me.
[123:09.82]I swear to God it is.
[123:13.05]Look at my face!
[123:14.55]Do you need me to do this?
[123:18.81]Look!
[123:20.17]We have to prove this!
[123:21.76]I need to make sure people understand this is actually me!
[123:26.32]Look!
[123:27.40]Look at the beard!
[123:28.72]Look it!
[123:29.90]Look!

[123:38.77]Look it!
[123:40.75]That's me!
[123:41.17]That's me!
[123:43.26]That's my face.
[123:47.14]What more proof do you guys require?
[123:57.78]Squish your face against something.
[124:00.64]I don't know how you guys don't understand.
[124:01.70]This is the same person literally right here.
[124:05.98]Look.
[124:15.19]It's the same person.
[124:30.24]Lay on the desk.
[124:31.30]I'm not laying on the desk.
[124:32.42]We're moving on.
[124:33.02]What was I doing?
[124:50.10]It's a paid, it's not an actor.
[124:54.94]I lost my, hold on, I lost my entire train of thought right here.
[125:06.39]It's a VR model.
[125:09.54]Alright, electricity's off.
[125:12.32]That's fine.
[125:12.96]Turn everything back on.
[125:15.46]Wait, it's that guy again.
[125:16.22]Okay, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[125:17.30]Let me talk to that guy.
[125:21.25]I already did his quest.
[125:21.97]Does he have another one?
[125:23.73]Dude, there's a bum meddling in our business.
[125:25.65]I'll give you a favor if you beat him up for me.
[125:27.17]It says family on the man's t-shirt.
[125:29.35]He always wears a white tank top and is bald.
[125:33.12]White tank top, bald, and it says family.
[125:35.30]Is it on the map?
[125:39.24]Alright, beat up the man in the white tank top.
[125:45.50]That guy's...
[125:52.11]Not happening.
[126:06.96]What's wrong with the dog?
[126:08.54]What dog?
[126:14.83]He's fine, right there.
[126:20.67]Is the store not open?
[126:21.49]Oh, it's not open.
[126:22.01]It's not open.
[126:22.35]I got it.
[126:23.57]Alright, my cafe.
[126:27.83]It's a little cold inside.
[126:28.85]Is that what the burglar just said?
[126:34.08]Is that sleeping version of yourself chug pickle juice water?
[126:42.92]You're gonna buy some wallpaper for the shop.
[126:44.50]Oh, okay.
[126:47.56]Where do I buy it?
[126:51.50]Is it in close?
[126:56.62]No, oh, right, right, yep, yep, yep.
[127:01.47]Yep, yep, yep, right.
[127:03.99]Turn the prices down so people will stay longer.
[127:08.73]Longer means more money.
[127:09.83]Oh, I get you, okay.
[127:12.15]I see.
[127:12.53]Oh, treat the customer with respect and they won't just leave.
[127:18.14]Interesting concept.

[127:49.36]White tank top.
[127:51.73]I mean, it's like everyone has a white tank top on.
[127:53.51]You got a white tank top?
[128:04.60]White tank top.
[128:13.75]What just happened?
[128:24.17]What?
[128:28.77]I broke the bat on him?

[129:56.79]Okay, physical.
[129:57.85]Body.

[130:58.57]He was just in the way.
[130:59.57]I need to get a console.
[131:09.40]It's not fair.
[131:11.24]Wait, did I let him use the computer?
[131:14.18]Yeah.
[131:22.76]You punch like lightning.
[131:23.74]Enemies have a hard time understanding where the punches are coming from.
[131:28.61]Throw harder punches.
[131:29.39]Alright.
[131:30.93]I think that's good.
[131:32.21]For now.
[131:40.74]Please buy a TV.
[131:43.12]Dude, I'm trying to buy a TV.
[131:45.70]They are $600 or $700.
[131:57.75]I have to just wait until I have the money.
[132:01.83]Look.

[132:34.67]I literally was just up to try to take that money.
[132:37.58]Dude.
[132:48.02]No, stop hitting people that are walking by.
[132:50.07]Fuck.
[132:57.47]What?
[132:58.41]How did you get in?
[133:20.17]I can't... I need... Computers don't even have a video card.
[133:25.82]Yes, they do.
[133:27.64]It's on board.
[133:28.66]On board graphics have come such a long way.
[133:30.58]Shut up.
[133:45.07]I think I gotta close.
[133:45.82]Nope, not yet.
[133:51.26]Please, just have a customer do something for the love of God.
[133:55.06]There you go.
[133:57.40]Enjoy.
[133:57.76]There's a used TV at the second-hand store?
[134:02.95]Are you kidding me?
[134:05.27]Alright, after this guy leaves, I'm closing up and we're gonna go get it.
[134:21.39]Hurry up.
[134:23.35]I'm trying to close, man.
[134:44.46]The electricity is off in the store.
[134:46.47]Nobody can get in here anyways.
[134:49.23]Second-hand store.
[134:49.89]Let's go.
[134:59.69]Alright, I'm looking for a TV.
[135:04.05]Uh, quick plus.
[135:06.65]Do you have a TV?
[135:07.38]You didn't have a TV.
[135:11.40]Old LCD.
[135:12.68]Pro LCD.
[135:13.56]Those aren't TVs, though.
[135:18.46]Behind you.
[135:20.10]Holy shit, I thought those were his legs.
[135:21.94]I was like, what is going on?
[135:29.72]Um, there's no TV.
[135:38.93]He's watching the stream down the street.
[135:40.97]At least get a bat.
[135:41.75]I can't.
[135:42.39]I can't spend any money or people lose.
[135:47.55]I lose the bet.
[135:52.59]I'm gonna go save the game.
[135:59.15]Hmm.
[136:10.35]Need a bat?
[136:10.85]I know.
[136:25.50]New day.
[136:29.76]Okay.
[136:30.58]Here we go.
[136:41.12]You're gonna play Monster Hunter Rise?
[136:42.48]Eh, probably not.
[136:44.61]Probably not.
[136:45.19]Okay.
[136:58.19]You got another quest?
[137:02.05]It says family.
[137:03.01]I know.
[137:06.31]But I can't even hurt him.
[137:19.56]Alright, open the store.
[137:20.60]Electricity on.
[137:22.48]Scan for viruses.
[137:30.95]Can play Dying Light 2?
[137:31.99]Yeah.
[137:32.83]I would say, for sure.
[137:46.26]Scan.
[137:49.61]Yeah, yeah, they got a blue screen.
[137:50.85]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
[137:53.67]Can you play League of Legends?
[137:56.31]No, I don't want to play League.
[137:57.77]That's the last thing I'd probably ever do.
[138:05.46]I would cover myself in peanut butter.
[138:08.20]And, like, roll around on the ground.
[138:10.30]Before I played one game of League of Legends on stream.
[138:18.81]I need money.
[138:26.75]Clean.
[138:34.71]600 bucks.
[138:34.99]That's all I need.
[138:36.78]Just stay here for a long time.
[138:38.22]I don't care what you do.
[138:39.98]You have free reign to do whatever you want and go wherever you want.
[138:42.22]I don't care.
[138:42.86]Just stay here and pay me money.
[138:56.38]Okay.
[139:01.38]Still here, yeah?
[139:01.88]Alright.
[139:05.28]Scan, still scanning.
[139:08.31]Just go beat up Vin Diesel, it pays well.
[139:11.47]I tried to beat up Vin Diesel, but my back broke across his cement body.
[139:17.95]My bat shattered on him.
[139:28.87]Alright, let me get some money here.
[139:35.18]It's not bad.
[139:37.16]Almost there.
[139:38.18]Just maybe like another three customers and I'm good.
[139:47.50]More tips.
[139:53.67]Where's my... Do I have a tip jar?
[140:04.60]I can't beat up Vin Diesel with my bare hands.
[140:12.54]What?
[140:16.53]What did I do?
[140:20.77]Why would he do that?
[140:35.05]Alright, watching YouTube.
[140:35.81]Alright, I'm... If I can... Is there a block?
[140:43.35]That's not block.
[140:51.64]Is that me?
[140:52.16]Oh, I'm laughing.
[140:55.46]Oh, okay.
[140:56.10]So now I get it.
[140:56.76]Remember I've been hearing that person laugh?
[141:00.00]I think I've been accidentally pressing it.
[141:02.04]It's been me.
[141:10.91]If you're gonna do a live-action Family Guy roleplay stream.
[141:16.76]I don't believe so, no.
[141:23.96]Why is there a middle finger button?
[141:29.96]No, I'd say there's a zero chance of that happening.
[141:38.01]Okay, we're good.
[141:42.08]Alright, I need... Please let me know.
[141:44.99]Can I actually fight?
[141:47.73]And beat Vin Diesel one on... One.
[141:56.18]He killed me in one hit last time.
[141:57.50]I don't think I'm ready.
[142:10.14]I don't know.
[142:10.50]I keep thinking of Trump putting the mask on from the mask.
[142:16.86]That's all I see.
[142:18.84]The Jim Carrey mask.
[142:26.05]What?
[142:30.27]Somebody stop me.
[142:31.39]Excuse me.
[142:36.88]You can't vote for that for the worst joke of the year.
[142:39.88]It didn't take five minutes to set up.
[142:45.64]P-A-R-T-Y?
[142:46.82]Excuse me.
[142:48.71]No.
[142:49.43]Believe me.
[142:51.53]Because I got it.
[142:59.85]I'm sorry.
[143:02.70]You can't vote for where's impression every year if I do a shitty Trump.
[143:12.44]I do a bad Trump every year.
[143:14.40]More than once a year.
[143:15.31]So don't- you can't nominate it.
[143:16.75]It's all- it's gonna happen.
[143:17.79]It's gonna be bad every year.
[143:25.33]It's cold in here?
[143:45.33]You have enough money to gamble now.
[143:48.48]I am so close to actually being able to play this game correctly.
[143:52.88]I'm not going to do that.
[143:56.51]There are 20,000 people here.
[143:57.89]Holy shit.
[144:00.31]What's up?
[144:04.69]What are you all doing here?
[144:14.60]Just vibing.
[144:15.38]Yeah, alright, me too.
[144:17.36]Alright, close, close, close, close.
[144:18.80]Is it your birthday?
[144:19.40]Happy birthday.
[144:19.94]I hope you have a good birthday.
[144:23.63]I am so close.
[144:30.19]How much is the TV?
[144:31.03]$650.
[144:31.13]I'm almost there for the life of me.
[144:47.37]I'm here from that Reddit video.
[144:54.13]The Reddit videos.
[145:00.28]So funny, like this community has made me more popular without me even doing anything.
[145:04.98]I didn't even do anything.
[145:06.01]I just like my face existed.
[145:18.78]Alright, this'll be it right here.
[145:30.33]The sus guy.
[145:31.07]The serial killer.
[145:32.17]The look-I'm-hearing-again thing.
[145:35.01]I have nothing to do with any of these things.
[145:37.47]None.
[145:38.11]Zero.
[145:44.30]I find out about them when you do.
[145:52.66]So those of you that are coming from some of the stuff that you've seen on Reddit.
[145:55.92]Oh man!

[146:07.56]So I open up my phone, you open up your phone.
[146:09.78]Whoa man!
[146:11.02]What's this on the front page?
[146:12.68]We both do the same fucking thing at the same time.
[146:14.28]I have no idea what they're going to do.
[146:15.70]I don't have no idea what we're looking at.
[146:17.62]I have no idea.
[146:19.30]I'm usually shitting.
[146:27.21]I didn't do anything.
[146:28.41]I'm being stolen from.
[146:29.87]Move.
[146:33.61]Move.
[146:35.35]No, I don't want to fight two people.
[146:38.85]What the fuck was that?
[146:43.19]No, don't fight three people.
[146:45.11]Run.
[146:45.27]I got my money.
[146:45.79]Run.
[146:45.91]Can I climb this?
[147:00.77]Get out of here.
[147:01.35]Close the door.
[147:01.81]Close the door.
[147:02.15]I just saw like sniper bullets go by me.
[147:04.39]What was that?
[147:05.31]What was that?
[147:06.69]What the fuck just happened?
[147:07.79]I just saw bullets go by me.
[147:10.74]How are you walking through a door?
[147:13.12]Okay.
[147:35.95]We're still open.
[147:48.08]No, I'm not warming the inside.
[147:49.70]Why did you hit Elon?
[147:53.06]I don't know.
[147:53.70]He was blocking the way, so I'm trying to get around him and jump over the railing.
[147:57.32]Are you going to play Deus Ex?
[148:02.98]Probably not.
[148:11.64]Any game that is more than 20-30 hours, you'll probably never see on this stream.
[148:18.02]The only exception is FromSoftwareGames.
[148:20.54]And if I get obsessed with something for like a week, maybe like Monster Rancher or whatever.
[148:26.62]This will do it.
[148:27.02]This is going to do it.
[148:27.52]What about Dawn of War?
[148:36.26]Yeah, I mean, if we...
[148:37.95]Maybe it'd be kind of fun to get a bunch of streamers to just play a huge game of Dawn of War.
[148:42.03]I think that'd be funny.
[148:47.08]Give everybody kind of a basic rundown on how the game works and have a gigantic, like, 12 person streamer RTS battle.
[148:56.30]With teams.
[149:05.27]Alright, come pay so I can buy a TV.
[149:13.15]Are you going to stream all of Elden Ring?
[149:15.84]Yes.
[149:20.84]I have played every FromSoftware game that has released in the last six years or so on this stream to completion.
[149:28.45]I'm going to do it again.
[149:33.79]You only stream two days a week, though.
[149:37.05]I mean, when a big release like that comes out that I've been looking forward to, I will play more if I can.
[149:44.50]What about the new Fable?
[149:45.40]Is there a new Fable coming out?
[149:51.98]Alright, this will put us over the edge, I think.
[149:54.52]Yep.
[149:55.54]Alright.
[149:58.18]Finally.
[149:58.78]$668.
[149:58.84]It's time to buy the TV.
[150:04.42]I would like for the mods to pay out.
[150:08.58]I did it.
[150:11.12]I told you not to doubt me.
[150:14.41]But a lot of you did anyways.
[150:15.42]That's the last piece of this puzzle, and then I can start making a bunch of money on the console games.
[150:28.16]Diesel's right there.
[150:42.01]Why can't I just like spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin?
[150:45.01]Tornado punch right here.
[150:46.19]Right in the head.
[150:49.75]I would be able to win.
[150:50.61]I don't want anyone to steal this.
[150:59.40]Nobody take this, please.
[151:02.86]Say Elon Musk again.
[151:03.84]I just did.
[151:08.07]Yes.
[151:08.37]Console TV.
[151:10.63]Console TV.
[151:12.97]Finally.
[151:15.55]Consoles.
[151:20.47]I need a second controller.
[151:21.45]Alright.
[151:25.13]I have $18.
[151:34.55]It's rain.
[151:35.05]There's actually weather in the game.
[151:41.21]I'm just gonna sell, like, the thermometer or something.
[151:48.49]What about, like, Breath of the Wild?
[151:49.93]Or Breath of the Wild 2?
[151:53.93]I'll come clean.
[151:57.55]A lot of the older viewers know this, but maybe the newer ones don't.
[152:00.75]I don't... I'm not... I don't really... I'm not a big Zelda fan.
[152:07.57]I don't get excited for Zelda.
[152:11.01]Breath of the Wild, I know it's an awesome game, but it's a Zelda game and I can't go over that hump for some reason.
[152:21.94]I was never truly into the Zelda games.
[152:28.19]The last Zelda game that I really played or really cared about was probably Ocarina of Time, if I'm honest.
[152:36.45]And then Twilight Princess, I remember playing it, and it's just like opening your eyes underwater in a pool.
[152:45.68]And then getting out and looking at lights.
[152:48.38]The Twilight Princess was pool vision for the whole game, and I couldn't play it.
[152:52.11]You didn't pay.
[153:10.98]Oh my God.
[153:12.28]I'm getting headbutt.
[153:15.02]Fucking $11, man.
[153:20.68]Give me another controller.
[153:30.53]Controllers.
[153:34.72]Why are they so expensive?
[153:51.95]Oh, no, he killed that guy.
[153:53.33]What?
[153:54.45]Oh, my God.
[153:55.32]Is this okay?
[153:58.28]Thank God.
[154:06.60]Is there some storyline that I'm missing here of why the people from Squid Game keep on throwing, just bombing my cafe?
[154:14.91]Am I missing a piece of the story here?
[154:21.15]Or is that just, hey, there's guys that are in Squid Game outfits that are going to, like, explode your business?
[154:26.38]I don't understand.
[154:29.34]Why are they doing that?
[154:31.66]Why?
[154:32.30]Why?
[154:36.12]Why are they in squid game outfits?
[154:56.78]That's good.
[154:57.22]It has a smell in here.
[154:59.82]Awful.
[155:08.89]Okay.
[155:09.41]I think we're good.
[155:09.97]Electricity back on.
[155:14.02]This needs the keyboard back.
[155:20.98]Good.
[155:21.24]Okay.
[155:28.28]Perfect.
[155:28.74]I need that other controller.
[155:33.90]I love this stream.
[155:34.54]Jerma really just says buzzwords.
[155:37.60]I do?
[155:40.63]I just say buzzwords?
[155:42.01]What do you mean?
[155:49.66]What buzzwords?
[155:57.68]There's so many viruses on that computer.
[156:04.47]I need a bat, too.
[156:06.73]Fine, I know.
[156:07.61]I'll pay the fine right here.
[156:11.43]Fucking asshole, why?
[156:13.09]No one pays!
[156:13.91]No one pays!
[156:16.33]Has anyone paid in two days?
[156:24.76]Fucking Jesus.
[156:39.15]Alright, this, whatever, this, like, tinky-winky guy.
[156:41.65]Here.
[156:43.75]Get on, get on, get on, get on.
[156:52.78]What's wrong?
[156:57.55]Need to get a security guard?
[156:58.57]I have $30, dude.
[156:59.39]I have 30 bucks.
[157:12.65]La-la.
[157:27.72]Clean.
[157:28.12]Alright, please pay.
[157:32.18]You said you were never gonna say that again.
[157:35.54]No, I didn't.
[157:35.98]I said I'm never gonna say the, um, the E word again.
[157:46.43]Get the temperature.
[157:49.14]It's 15 degrees in here?
[157:50.22]15 degrees Celsius?
[158:01.36]That's not that cold, is it?
[158:04.55]What is that, like 50?
[158:05.61]60?
[158:06.27]50?
[158:06.29]45 or something?
[158:08.95]How hot is that?
[158:09.91]Yeah, that's not even... How's that cold?
[158:27.56]59 is cold.
[158:28.42]Yeah, I know.
[158:32.58]We've had the conversation about how hot or cold a room should be, right?
[158:39.13]People think I'm crazy for not wanting to be in a house that's 67 or 68 degrees.
[158:46.49]I want my place to be between 72 and 73.
[158:50.01]Between like 72 and like 74...
[158:58.67]68 might as well be an icebox.
[159:01.63]It's a walk-in freezer.
[159:06.00]People turn their thermostats down at night because you get better sleep or something, right?
[159:11.96]Oh, I turn my thermostat down to like 65 at night.
[159:15.26]I would die in 65.
[159:16.28]I would be dead.
[159:17.90]I would wake up dead.
[159:21.21]That's way too cold.
[159:22.37]72 is perfect.
[159:33.80]Being in a colder room promotes better sleep, I guess.
[159:36.95]Some study from somebody.
[159:39.57]I don't know.
[159:41.23]No, not happening.
[159:42.13]64 is perfect.
[159:48.13]No.
[159:49.31]Don't leave without paying.
[159:50.71]Don't leave without... Give me the money.
[160:04.84]What?
[160:06.17]Why does nobody pay?
[160:08.13]Why does nobody pay?
[160:13.91]I didn't give him access to the computer.
[160:15.33]Then why was he there using it?
[160:16.81]He should have been using it.
[160:22.12]So he didn't have access to it, but he used it anyways?
[160:26.00]So he used it and then just left?
[160:34.48]I'm getting a bat.
[160:48.03]How much is the bat?
[160:48.95]I'll take it.
[160:49.33]See, it looks like his legs.
[161:03.16]Oh, how much are the controllers?
[161:06.79]80 bucks?
[161:07.17]Alright, that's better than buying it.
[161:08.39]120.
[161:11.01]Alright, where's Vin Diesel?
[161:19.78]I'm not messing around now.
[161:36.72]He broke the bat last time?
[161:38.36]Wait, will he actually break it?
[161:39.42]I have to pay the fine.
[161:45.49]I'm five cents short of the fine.
[161:54.61]Whoever comes here has no self-esteem.
[161:57.00]Okay.
[162:04.30]Ooh, nice.
[162:11.84]That has a wear meter.
[162:13.34]Is that why it broke?
[162:14.60]Not because Vin Diesel's like stacked?
[162:17.34]So wait, I actually can get him with it?
[162:26.59]It does have a wear meter.
[162:27.70]Alright, I'm going for it.
[162:40.82]Thanks for coming.
[162:53.04]Tell your friends about the consoles that we're about to add.
[162:55.02]If I see Vin Diesel, he's getting it.
[163:00.89]There he is.
[163:07.33]There he is.
[163:08.99]He's right there.
[163:24.97]I don't want to hit four people with this.
[163:29.52]Didn't they double team me earlier?
[163:31.22]These two?
[163:35.86]Oh, damn it.
[163:36.66]I didn't want to hit that guy.
[163:39.58]Fuck.
[163:40.54]That was so salivary.
[163:41.62]Did you hear that?
[163:42.98]Where is he?
[163:51.73]Yes.
[163:52.03]Alright.
[163:52.31]Do I get money for this?
[163:56.31]200 bucks!
[163:57.77]That's really good.
[164:01.71]Don't even think about it.
[164:02.31]Oh, somebody left without paying.
[164:11.28]Alright, I'm gonna go buy a controller.
[164:18.31]And then I can actually use that.
[164:20.39]And that- I'm gonna make that expensive.
[164:31.30]Oh, shit.
[164:35.55]What do I do?
[164:36.95]Does he still owe me that?
[164:40.19]He owes me that, right?
[164:51.96]Okay.
[165:03.41]He owes me that thing.
[165:13.04]Alright, nice.
[165:13.46]Hell yeah.
[165:16.18]Thank you.
[165:17.14]Finally.
[165:17.58]It's only taken two hours to do it.
[165:27.69]Do I like coleslaw?
[165:29.92]Eh, it depends.
[165:30.84]Not really.
[165:33.22]The only place I've really ever liked coleslaw from was Cain's.
[165:37.98]And that's because I like to... So after you eat Cain's,
[165:44.46]Once you got like the sauce, you got the, you know, whatever, the fries, you got the chicken that's kind of all over inside of the kind of styrofoam thing, whatever.
[165:53.54]When it all mixes together, let's say you take a bite of a sandwich or you eat like a piece and it kind of falls into the kind of well that you have in front of you.
[166:01.97]I like to dump the coleslaw in afterwards.
[166:06.03]And I kind of mix it all up and just eat the coleslaw with all like the junk that fell out of the sandwich and stuff.
[166:12.05]That's the only time I really eat it.
[166:17.05]Alright.
[166:18.09]I have... It's a... It's... We're gonna make this two bucks an hour.
[166:24.51]It's expensive.
[166:26.99]We're doing it.
[166:38.44]The bat is ready to go.
[166:39.64]I'm gonna enjoy some console games.
[166:45.55]Get the fine two.
[166:46.25]That's right.
[166:56.49]Okay.
[167:00.68]He eats Hamburger Helper.
[167:01.76]Why are you all surprised he eats like a starving rodent?
[167:04.14]Hamburger Helper is good.
[167:05.44]Consult.
[167:12.72]We don't have to have this conversation again.
[167:25.52]There are no games for the console.
[167:26.84]Really?
[167:30.24]I mean, she's in here.
[167:31.34]Okay.
[167:42.88]Nice.
[167:45.48]Alright, then I'm going to get an arcade machine to go in the corner.
[167:49.33]I wouldn't feed hamburger help to my greatest enemy.
[167:54.76]It's, why?
[167:55.95]It's so easy.
[167:56.83]It's such an easy dinner.
[167:57.83]It feeds, it feeds like 60 people when you make a box.
[168:04.23]All it is, is just ground beef and the box.
[168:06.87]It's really easy to make.
[168:11.39]It's really hearty.
[168:12.25]It's really filling.
[168:13.03]It's good.
[168:18.90]I said this in the beginning of the stream.
[168:20.08]It's gross when you make it.
[168:27.17]But after it's done, and you take a bite, you go, holy shit, this is insane.
[168:44.12]My mom used to feed me hamburger helper all the time.
[168:45.98]Pretty sure it's why I have, whatever.
[168:48.38]Alright, that was 120 bucks right there.
[168:59.42]His birthday's coming up in five days?
[169:01.14]Hold on, let me see.
[169:03.04]This is from Ken.
[169:04.46]My girlfriend and I are massive fans and have been watching for two years now.
[169:07.43]It's her birthday coming up in five days.
[169:08.67]Alright.
[169:09.37]Alright.
[169:12.63]You want a unique birthday present?
[169:14.91]What's your girlfriend's name?
[169:21.93]Does anybody walk out without paying?
[169:35.23]Does all the beef you eat come from a box?
[169:37.17]You don't, it's, the hamburger helper is not, it's not in the box.
[169:41.74]You buy ground beef from the butcher, and it's not inside the box.
[169:47.48]You buy ground beef from the butcher, and then you take that, you brown the beef, you brown it in a pan, and then you put the box in with some water and some milk, and you Ster it up.
[169:56.49]It's so easy.
[170:00.75]Hamburger Helper is divorced dad food.
[170:03.81]Hamburger Helper, this is, you are slandering something that I love.
[170:08.97]And I'm not going to put, I'm going to put my foot down right now.
[170:11.69]It's not divorced dad food.
[170:18.60]I really like it.
[170:19.58]The Beef Stroganoff Hamburger Helper is like actually 10 out of 10.
[170:24.14]Okay, you know the green eggs, you remember green eggs and ham?
[170:26.10]Do you remember what happened at the end of green eggs and ham?
[170:29.61]SamIM ate it, and he said, holy shit, this is the best food I've ever had in my fucking life.
[170:33.55]Thanks a lot, Jerry, whatever his name was.
[170:38.79]Go eat the Beef Stroganoff Hamburger Helper.
[170:41.23]Just go try it.
[170:43.71]And then you can go... And then it goes like... And everyone's like happy.
[171:00.65]Get a divorce and eat hamburger helper on stream.
[171:25.24]How much are they paying you?
[171:27.92]do you let me be very clear I need to be incredibly clear about this do you think that I would take just completely un just solicited a hamburger helper sponsorship on this stream just out of nowhere would I do you really think that would happen that's not even remotely the case it's never been
[171:55.70]Money, money, money, money, money.
[171:57.06]Money.
[171:57.64]Give it to me.
[171:58.02]Don't walk away.
[171:58.88]Give it to me.
[172:00.42]Alright, I'm getting actually cash here.
[172:09.36]Alright, is it her... Her name is, uh... Her name is Ari.
[172:13.97]Ari?
[172:14.77]Ari, sure.
[172:17.47]You want a birthday wish?
[172:18.37]Let's go for it.
[172:18.85]Hold on.

[173:00.15]Hey, Ari.
[173:02.65]Ken lets me know it's your birthday coming up in five days on the 17th.
[173:05.27]I just want to say real quick, happy birthday.
[173:08.80]It's been a rough couple of years for everybody here, but keep your head up.
[173:15.92]Happy birthday, Ari.
[173:18.45]There it is.
[173:19.19]Birthday wishes.
[173:20.55]Anybody else got a birthday?
[173:29.23]Put a cameo watermark up.
[173:34.05]I have one coming up in July.
[173:34.95]Hey!
[173:37.01]Nano wiener!
[173:38.75]Happy birthday in July, for God's sakes.
[173:42.59]That's... I feel like I'm getting, like, radiation sickness from this thing.
[173:50.19]You know what I mean?
[173:50.65]Just like... Should I just be this close to my face?
[174:01.39]Oh, hey, my wife Erin's birthday is coming up.

[174:32.67]Alright, I'm fucking getting off.
[174:46.22]My birthday's February.
[174:47.34]Happy birthday in February.
[174:54.36]Why is he online right now?
[174:55.88]I don't know.
[174:56.34]How much money do I have?
[175:03.17]I already have $366.
[175:03.81]Happy birthday, Leslie.
[175:08.09]It's in February.
[175:08.71]Happy birthday, Leslie.
[175:09.49]It's in February.
[175:11.53]Happy birthday.
[175:11.99]Come on up.
[175:14.80]Alright.
[175:17.40]Nice.
[175:19.16]Clean up a little bit.
[175:32.96]My girlfriend's birthday is tomorrow.
[175:33.84]I didn't see the name.
[175:34.82]Happy birthday.
[175:37.62]Slot machine is coming up here.
[175:39.84]Slot machine's birthday in February.
[175:41.44]Happy birthday to the slot machine in February.
[175:53.11]Speaking of which, I'm going to just play a little bit.
[176:01.12]I'm just going to play a little bit.
[176:02.55]Not much.
[176:03.09]Just enough to get a good taste.
[176:14.83]Alright.
[176:15.13]This is it.
[176:24.10]Dude.
[176:26.48]Why?
[176:27.86]Come on, Gwynn.
[176:31.32]Come on, dude.
[176:31.86]Do it again.
[176:36.82]Somebody else need to... Why is it... I was supposed to say Halloween music.
[176:45.65]Why is it Christmas... Oh my god.
[176:52.67]I just like killed three people.
[176:54.25]What do you want to do?
[177:00.01]Alright, what do you want to play?
[177:00.87]I got a couple games that you can line up here.
[177:09.64]Again?
[177:09.90]Come on, do it again.
[177:12.82]Please.
[177:13.30]This thing sucks.
[177:19.13]It actually sucks.
[177:22.53]I don't even know what lines I'm looking for.
[177:29.82]That, how is that not, doesn't make any sense.
[177:31.99]There should be a line right there.
[178:04.16]They were running in tandem.
[178:05.58]There's nothing I can do about that.
[178:17.35]That's a lot of bananas.
[178:20.39]Alright, nine, seven, watermelons.
[178:24.14]What?
[178:26.80]How is that not a line?
[178:38.64]Where's the- Nobody pays for anything!
[178:45.01]Nobody pays!
[178:46.51]Nobody pays for anything here!
[178:50.59]Where did- Where'd they go?
[178:53.84]What's he gonna play?
[179:14.16]I need candies.
[179:15.60]I'm gonna blow all my money again.
[179:17.28]I have to stop.
[179:18.62]Oh, but come on.
[179:23.57]I need to get something.
[179:24.55]Grapes.
[179:25.53]That seemed good.
[179:26.29]46 plus 30.
[179:28.83]Come on.
[179:29.07]More.
[179:29.29]More.
[179:44.36]More.
[179:46.30]Alright.
[179:46.87]Peaches.
[179:48.41]Peaches.
[179:49.49]Watermelons.
[179:52.17]Stop running out and not paying!
[179:55.31]Was that Trump?
[180:20.06]Okay.
[180:20.78]Hold on.
[180:21.06]I'm coming.
[180:21.28]I'm coming.
[180:23.18]Nobody pays.
[180:23.78]Everybody just runs out of the room.
[180:25.16]And everyone just runs.
[180:27.18]Everyone just runs.
[180:33.51]That was Trump.
[180:35.37]It's a great place.
[180:37.17]It's a great place.
[180:37.93]That's all I need to tell.
[180:39.93]It's the only thing you need to know.
[180:44.75]Even the owner of this place is like a thousand milliseconds.
[180:47.54]He opened the table in
[180:57.40]But he tried to pay and he gave me a good rating Oh Amy Are you messing with my slots?
[181:19.76]Did I win any money?
[181:20.28]I just won money.
[181:23.20]I just won like 300 bucks.
[181:24.74]Look!
[181:34.94]No!
[181:35.80]I was in the...
[181:47.90]There was a whole, there was a line to do, right?
[181:52.74]I think there was actually a line to do.
[181:56.83]I'm doing one more at $100.
[181:58.09]Done.
[182:01.29]God damn it.
[182:02.99]Okay, no more.
[182:07.30]This place is turning into a dump.
[182:38.17]If that hit, it would've been like 10 grand.
[182:48.37]I'm not playing that machine again.
[182:50.11]It's a piece of crap.
[182:53.69]That thing was a piece of shit.
[182:54.81]It just was.
[182:56.11]Let's be honest.
[183:04.75]Alright, it's clean.
[183:09.59]Alright.
[183:12.99]Claw game is literally free money.
[183:14.68]You know what?
[183:15.12]I had so much better of a... I have six dollars now.
[183:18.10]What?
[183:18.28]Can I just get my money back?
[183:25.78]Yeah, I'll buy... I'll buy one dollar.
[183:28.21]I'll buy five dollars in Bitcoin.
[183:34.30]No, I don't want to buy $160,000 in Bitcoin.
[183:35.26]I want to buy .00000000 What?
[183:36.12]I want to buy .0000001 Why can't I? 0.0
[184:04.30]What the hell?
[184:06.12]I have to buy Doge?
[184:07.22]Okay, I have 10 Dogecoin.
[184:17.58]Alright, play for a while.
[184:33.31]Heh heh heh heh.
[184:36.36]Now, you guys don't understand.
[184:37.30]If Dogecoin goes to 450 million dollars, I'm gonna be a billionaire.
[184:43.61]Why does the guy smell?
[184:44.29]Why does he smell?
[184:54.11]He smells.
[185:01.46]Why does he... Oh, I smell.
[185:06.23]Oh, speaking of smelling, I haven't taken a break yet.
[185:07.71]I don't know what that's supposed to mean, but I have to pee.
[185:11.67]I'll pee right back.
[185:14.45]It's pee time.
[185:18.44]Let him play.
[185:18.96]Wait, this pauses the game, right?
[185:20.80]I'll be right back.
[185:22.62]BRB.
[185:23.28]Pee time.
[185:29.73]Oh, by the way, it's still Christmas.
[185:31.29]I like this Christmas thing.
[185:32.27]By the way, Blordow was working on the winter one.
[185:35.86]And it looks awesome.
[185:37.34]I can't wait to switch to it.
[185:39.11]Christmas, one more time.
[185:40.09]Why not?
[185:40.43]One more for Christmas.
[185:41.09]Let's go.
[187:57.28]Thank you.
[190:01.23]Thank you.
[191:16.87]Dude flushed himself.
[191:25.61]Alright, let's keep going.
[191:44.01]We're in the flushed away universe now.
[191:45.97]Fucking god damn it.
[191:47.80]I forgot.
[191:49.38]My water.
[191:49.90]Give me a sec.
[193:44.62]Alright.
[193:49.22]Complete refill.
[193:50.07]Let me turn this back up.
[194:01.99]He's got a full glass.
[194:04.75]Who does the songs?
[194:05.63]Blordow.
[194:08.01]He is a talented individual.
[194:14.32]And he is currently working on four or five new tracks.
[194:18.46]Which is awesome.
[194:20.96]And we should be very excited.
[194:24.12]Also a new winter-themed BRB screen.
[194:27.40]Please package your pee and send it to me.
[194:28.90]No.
[194:36.00]I'm not going to package my pee.
[194:41.43]Why did I read that?
[194:42.17]I don't know.
[194:42.59]I just, I read the, I read the weird shit.
[194:44.47]Okay.
[194:44.97]I'm sorry.
[194:46.01]That's the way it is.
[194:51.88]I'm all refueled.
[194:52.68]Ready to rock and roll.
[195:00.70]Ready to rock and roll.
[195:02.30]What was the last thing I was doing?
[195:13.38]Fueled with heal.
[195:14.26]No, not heal.
[195:15.36]Just regular water.
[195:28.71]Thank you for always reading the weird shit.
[195:30.45]Yeah, I know.
[195:33.41]It stands out like a sore thumb.
[195:34.87]It really does.
[195:48.39]I need to... Okay, trash can.
[195:50.83]I need a trash can.
[195:54.17]I'm sorry for calling you the Ted Bundy of Twitch that time.
[195:56.59]Yeah, sorry.
[195:58.56]Did somebody just run out?
[196:06.92]No.
[196:10.70]This guy's been here for a long time.
[196:11.66]Okay.
[196:23.19]Okay, I looked down.
[196:24.01]I was like, why do I have three dollars?
[196:29.74]I had four hundred like ten seconds ago.
[196:33.76]Why do I have only three fucking dollars?
[196:41.01]How much is Dogecoin gone up?
[196:44.62]Hopefully the devs put, like, a joke in the game or something where, like, Dogecoin goes, like, up, like, 5 million percent.
[196:50.38]I'm just gonna make sure that I always have, like, a hundred bucks in Doge in this game.
[196:55.21]Because they're probably gonna do that.
[196:58.23]Don't leave.
[196:59.47]You left.
[196:59.79]Okay.
[197:00.25]Alright.
[197:07.27]Did I just break it?
[197:08.13]Why is it... This guy kicked me once.
[197:10.77]What?! !
[197:14.67]Everybody's paying without... Oh my god.
[197:25.97]They both just left without... Okay.
[197:33.65]Use the bat?
[197:34.33]I just did and it broke on his head.
[197:35.69]Alright.
[197:41.24]If I gamble again, I'm going to open it.
[197:44.10]We're going to clean up.
[197:44.86]I'm going to open the store.
[197:46.84]If I gamble again, I'm going to turn off the stream, okay?
[197:57.29]Over the next 30 straight minutes, over 30 minutes, if I gamble again, stream turns off.
[198:05.57]I am saving money.
[198:19.09]No more bullshit.
[198:20.34]No more gambling.
[198:22.40]Can we bet on that?
[198:23.50]Eh.
[198:26.40]No, no.
[198:27.04]You don't have to bet on that.
[198:30.28]How much is a bouncer?
[198:36.01]I feel like a bouncer is going to be more money than I'm even making.
[198:38.21]There we go.
[198:46.33]I would have like $1,500.
[198:47.05]I'd have at least $1,000 right now.
[198:55.49]Upgrade the punches.
[198:56.85]Hold on, wait.
[198:57.21]They want extended time.
[198:59.59]Extended time.
[199:07.86]It's the scratch ticket.
[199:08.86]VOD watchers, the stream ends in 10.
[199:10.50]It does not end in 10 minutes.
[199:20.65]Okay.
[199:21.59]Don't you want to go up yet?
[199:22.37]No.
[199:25.81]If you could do a voice for a cartoon, what would you do?
[199:29.05]Probably Otto.
[199:29.45]I feel like Otto would be a fun voice to do for a cartoon.
[199:36.74]Alright.
[199:37.32]70 bucks.
[199:37.54]80 bucks.
[199:38.04]That's really good.
[199:42.36]You smoke in here?
[199:51.73]That guy didn't even do anything, but I knew, I mean, he was, he was creepily walking into the store, right?
[199:57.04]I mean, that's not illegal, but it was, it was a little odd.
[200:01.36]I mean, that guy, whatever.
[200:06.60]You know what I mean.
[200:21.91]Oh my god, I have a lot of... What's wrong with this guy's head?
[200:26.59]Wait, did I punch this guy's neck backwards?
[200:28.31]I'll re-break it.
[200:33.19]Go to chiropractor.
[200:45.73]Alright, now money's absolutely rolling in now.
[200:48.87]No gambling at all till at least 8 p.m.
[200:51.25]Pacific.
[200:51.55]You understand?
[200:57.92]8 o'clock Pacific.
[200:58.48]I'm not gambling a cent till at least then.
[201:02.82]I need to... Okay, I need to warm it up a little bit in here.
[201:04.44]It's a little cold.
[201:07.38]Put the prices up a little bit.
[201:11.80]Here we go.
[201:13.56]Alright, I'm confident now.
[201:14.82]I'm good.
[201:21.25]What do I need?
[201:23.65]What do I actually... Maybe the... Yeah.
[201:31.11]What can I do for you?
[201:33.25]What do you want?
[201:33.63]What do you want?
[201:36.70]That's weird.
[201:40.04]I think it smells in here, does it?
[201:44.38]Oh my goodness, it stinks in here.
[201:46.80]I have no... The can's empty.
[201:49.50]What does it smell like in here?
[201:52.98]I have to go buy a stink remover, whatever it is.
[202:07.28]Buy some Bitcoin miners.
[202:17.95]There we go.
[202:28.51]Crash into the computer.
[202:29.37]That's fine.
[202:29.81]Oops.
[202:35.25]Oh.
[202:35.43]It's because it's an old PC.
[202:40.77]Is that why this thing keeps doing this?
[202:49.27]Just give me a second, man.
[202:50.75]The fucking place is on fire.
[202:56.94]Okay.
[202:58.89]Feel good?
[203:04.03]I'm ready.
[203:09.37]Sell the empty, um, extinguisher and buy a new one.
[203:11.74]You're almost out.
[203:12.20]Alright.
[203:12.38]Alright, you know, everybody just go home.
[203:24.52]Go home.
[203:24.82]Go, go, go.
[203:25.38]Get out of here.
[203:25.92]Go home.
[203:30.64]Take it!
[203:31.02]That was up.
[203:34.69]Oh my god.
[203:35.23]Alright.
[203:36.17]Electricity off.
[203:37.07]Everybody out.
[203:38.43]I'm going to sell the extinguisher.
[203:40.89]There's no electricity, so who's going to even go in there?
[203:48.21]Nobody cares.
[203:57.16]What can I sell this for?
[204:01.89]That's not bad.
[204:04.35]Can I buy one?
[204:05.29]How much are they?
[204:05.75]Alright, I definitely want to take it.
[204:09.09]If the whole place can't burn down, that would be awful.
[204:27.80]What about the spray can?
[204:33.67]Yeah, okay.
[204:34.27]It's time to go to bed.
[204:38.29]Is the place closed?
[204:42.53]Nobody can even do anything anyways.
[204:43.47]Just close it up.
[204:47.17]Save the game.
[205:04.35]Over here, right?
[205:04.77]Yeah.
[205:13.54]Can I call you... No.
[205:23.78]End of the stream voice?
[205:24.68]He hates streaming.
[205:29.12]Let me get that out of your head real quick.
[205:31.48]Look at me!
[205:32.50]See?
[205:32.85]That's not an end of the stream voice.
[205:42.02]I just haven't saved the game in like an hour and a half.
[206:04.15]Let me out!
[206:09.69]Is the city getting more populated?
[206:10.79]I feel like there's more people here now.
[206:22.64]What?
[206:23.00]What happened?
[206:25.92]They okay?
[206:32.13]Okay, they're okay.
[206:35.65]Right, right, it smells, it smells.
[206:36.63]Alright, let me buy another can of spray.
[206:39.61]Clean the place up.
[206:42.47]And then I'm gonna buy an arcade machine, and then we're gonna make a ton of money.
[206:46.12]I promise.
[206:52.46]15 bucks.
[206:52.96]Alright.
[206:53.54]Good to go.
[206:54.84]Let's go.
[206:58.42]Tell the empty can.
[207:09.34]Leave me alone.
[207:12.34]Stop moving.
[207:12.84]Yeah, I did.
[207:13.22]Okay.
[207:14.62]There's a new quest as well.
[207:16.79]Let me go see what that is.
[207:23.94]Hey friend, I heard that electricity is constantly turning off.
[207:26.58]These bastards are deliberately closing the electricity to take bribes.
[207:31.45]If you give me $200, I'll bribe those punks for you and they won't turn off the electricity ever again.
[207:37.01]I don't really care at this point.
[207:40.17]Takes two seconds to turn it back on.
[207:45.54]That's not worth $200.
[207:46.04]Nah.
[207:56.84]Do it for the quest.
[207:57.74]I'll do it once I get an arcade machine.
[208:03.10]Let's take a look.
[208:03.52]How much are those?
[208:05.22]Oh!
[208:07.58]It's up by 5%.
[208:08.02]Alright, just hold on to it.
[208:18.00]Arcade machine.
[208:24.92]There we go.
[208:27.05]That's not expensive.
[208:28.05]That's it?
[208:29.73]325.
[208:30.05]I got that right now.
[208:33.65]Alright, I got it.
[208:35.73]Why not?
[208:36.81]I'll do it.
[208:37.33]That's cheap.
[208:46.20]Alright, where's that empty spray can?
[208:47.28]No more bad reviews.
[208:52.99]And then I'll do the perks.
[208:57.13]That almost took a whole, imagine spraying an entire can of Febreze in your house.
[209:02.51]That would be awful.
[209:03.22]It'd be worse than it smelling bad.
[209:10.34]More customers coming to the cafe.
[209:11.82]Let's do that.
[209:12.24]Customers are greeted with a pleasant conversation and may ask for extra time.
[209:22.29]Or punch two.
[209:24.07]Yeah.
[209:26.85]You're much better at handling the baseball bat because of your background.
[209:29.70]Baseball bats can break more easily.
[209:31.44]I don't know if I want that.
[209:34.14]I'll take this though.
[209:35.36]Alright.
[209:42.57]Please don't.
[209:48.73]Where should I put this?
[209:49.33]In the corner?
[210:02.07]Do I set a price for this?
[210:05.96]We'll get to that, I hope.
[210:08.00]How much is that?
[210:08.46]Computers.
[210:15.88]Orders.
[210:16.36]Computers.
[210:17.16]Requests.
[210:18.36]Where is it?
[210:22.67]This thing is really janky.
[210:23.79]Yeah, but how do I... Does it just work?
[210:36.16]It's just auto-pay.
[210:36.98]Oh, okay, cool.
[210:42.38]Very, very nice.
[210:43.36]That's better.
[210:55.77]These are SpongeBob bubbles.
[210:56.94]They kind of look like it, don't they?
[210:57.90]I need to do a bat, too.
[211:04.04]Yeah, I'm out of bats.
[211:09.09]Okay, open.
[211:09.75]20 bucks.
[211:13.20]Should come back pretty quickly.
[211:16.02]I'm going to run and get it back wicked quick.
[211:20.28]Wait, I don't have any money.
[211:21.82]Never mind.
[211:28.29]Never mind.
[211:37.32]Come on in.
[211:42.66]The arcade machine is facing the wrong way.
[211:44.42]What?
[211:46.90]No, it isn't.
[211:47.24]It just looks like shit.
[211:49.06]That's why you think that.
[211:52.64]It's $30 to use the arcade machine?
[211:57.22]Why did I buy any of this other crap?
[211:58.84]What was the point of me buying any of this?
[212:03.40]I could have bought just three or four arcade machines.
[212:08.92]And just let them just roll.
[212:10.18]It takes two seconds.
[212:15.72]It pays better the more expensive the arcade machine is.
[212:17.57]I'm going to get another one.
[212:23.85]Is it true that you draw on your eyebrows?
[212:27.47]Um, I'll neither confirm nor deny that statement.
[212:31.09]Viruses.
[212:36.62]I'm just gonna pay for the monthly, uh, daily virus service thing.
[212:39.58]I think it's worth it.
[212:49.13]Can I get a- I said this earlier, but is there a barrel?
[212:51.15]Can I get a barrel?
[212:51.63]What are your thoughts on the Earth's core?
[212:54.73]We have no idea what it looks like.
[212:58.88]We made up everything that we think is in the Earth's core.
[213:05.30]Ow!
[213:16.59]Don't all run as one person Help help protect your king protect your king protect your king Okay
[213:44.75]No, please, why?
[213:46.89]I need to hit you with the head.
[213:48.31]I can't even fight you, though.
[213:51.39]Even though I've got level 2 fist powers, and I can't even do anything about it.
[213:54.83]Let me get you.
[213:56.71]Oh my god, that guy was about to walk away with $170 worth of game time.
[214:01.82]That guy slept here overnight.
[214:03.26]That was a hotel room.
[214:05.98]Okay.
[214:06.68]Don't leave without paying.
[214:08.58]I'm gonna say it once.
[214:11.26]Wait, you didn't?
[214:11.76]Okay.
[214:23.33]Okay.
[214:23.65]Stay good.
[214:27.01]300 bucks.
[214:28.45]There's an entire upgrade menu that you're ignoring.
[214:34.31]This one here?
[214:38.63]Don't leave without paying.
[214:40.11]It's so annoying.
[214:41.21]I... I clicked request on that guy.
[214:46.60]Look.
[214:53.27]No, it's in the apps.
[214:54.11]Really?
[215:07.16]Employ.
[215:07.66]Data so we can find employees.
[215:09.36]Alright.
[215:10.86]Great program that allows you to use the computer more professionally.
[215:15.80]Miner device.
[215:18.43]And then Spotify.
[215:19.53]Okay, well we'll do this now.
[215:21.61]That guy didn't pay either.
[215:30.75]I'm not gonna hit you.
[215:32.41]Okay.
[215:38.73]Everyone's fucking... I don't wanna spend... I gotta hire a bouncer.
[215:44.62]Immediately.
[215:48.80]What?
[215:50.74]No, don't.
[215:51.24]Ignore the people punching me in the face, though.
[215:53.52]Yep.
[215:54.20]Thanks for the search.
[215:55.24]I appreciate it.
[215:56.93]Wow.
[215:57.39]I wanna have food.
[215:59.68]Yeah, forget about the people that are attacking me.
[216:01.30]I can't get out of here.
[216:08.68]Request coming in.
[216:09.32]Close it.
[216:15.36]Yes, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[216:16.40]Let me guess, you're not going to pay.
[216:19.69]Shocker.
[216:28.92]It's so dirty in here.
[216:45.99]The arcade pays immediately?
[216:47.51]That's why I'm wondering, why do I even have any of these consoles?
[216:52.87]Or computers or anything, what's the point?
[216:54.71]They get- The arcade cabinet's not gonna get a virus.
[217:00.15]And people aren't going to walk away without paying.
[217:01.53]They have to already have paid.
[217:02.63]Can I just sell them?
[217:06.68]And just line the wall with cabinets?
[217:08.16]I'm paying it.
[217:25.11]No, you need variety.
[217:26.21]Okay.
[217:31.63]Money will start to actually really roll in here soon.
[217:35.43]I'll be good.
[217:44.63]Where's all this trash that I don't see?
[217:59.76]I don't want to fight you, but I will if I have to.
[218:09.53]Well, I don't know what that guy was doing.
[218:18.06]You're not going to walk away with $77.
[218:19.62]I'm sorry.
[218:21.36]Just max out the prices.
[218:22.46]Won't people just leave?
[218:23.22]Alright.
[218:25.16]$625. $625.
[218:32.76]I got some new apps.
[218:34.54]Employees.
[218:37.04]You can protect your shop from all kinds of attacks.
[218:38.81]Neutralize your enemies with a very fast reaction.
[218:41.71]Is this $300 for a day?
[218:44.35]Five?
[218:44.73]Day?
[218:45.05]Three?
[218:45.31]What's that mean?
[218:46.79]I feel like I'm reading the months of the year and stuff, like EU.
[218:49.73]What does this mean?
[218:54.39]Oh, bouncer.
[218:56.29]Nightmare thieves and non-paying customers.
[218:57.85]$260 every three days?
[219:03.27]Alright, where is he?
[219:12.39]Oh, nice, alright.
[219:16.25]So he beats people up for me?
[219:17.35]That's awesome.
[219:18.73]Now I don't have to worry about it.
[219:22.53]What else can I do?
[219:30.92]A mascot.
[219:36.57]Uh, sure.
[219:38.76]Is this stupid?
[219:51.25]Where's the mascot?
[219:58.75]There they are now.
[220:03.16]Everybody come on in!
[220:04.10]Come one, come all!
[220:06.87]And here, I just paid $200, the quest line's gonna go, and my electricity will never turn off.
[220:13.11]That leaves me with a grand total of... $15.
[220:17.18]Oh my god, he stole the TV.
[220:26.60]Oh my god.
[220:39.94]was insane.
[220:40.98]That guy was worth it.
[220:45.22]That was definitely worth it, without a doubt.
[220:51.69]Right to the back of the head, too.
[220:53.49]Wow.
[220:56.95]Alright, cool.
[221:02.10]This doesn't seem to be working.
[221:07.68]How does it smell?
[221:08.76]Smell good?
[221:09.74]We're good.
[221:14.02]This thing was 600 plus dollars.
[221:15.82]That would be so sad if I didn't see that.
[221:17.26]Come on in.
[221:27.96]In the meantime, what are the other apps?
[221:29.68]Alright, I hired some employees.
[221:33.38]What's this?
[221:33.76]Miner.
[221:37.59]Average mining power?
[221:38.63]Could not be reached.
[221:41.19]You could not be included in the network.
[221:42.89]Average mining power.
[221:43.83]I don't have enough power.
[221:46.55]Okay.
[221:54.04]Clean the chair.
[221:59.78]It probably radiates.
[222:00.64]I don't think I can clean the chair.
[222:07.68]So if they leave without paying, they get a roundhouse kick from that guy in the head.
[222:12.32]He's worth it.
[222:31.17]Oh, request.
[222:31.71]Okay.
[222:39.52]Get rid of the panda.
[222:40.14]Did you pay?
[222:42.96]I don't think so.
[222:47.44]Oh, no, no, no.
[222:47.86]He did the arcade cabinet.
[222:49.36]Yep, yep, yep.
[222:55.43]I can't clean this.
[222:59.89]It's just dirty.
[223:10.23]Should I get some more games?
[223:11.09]Alright.
[223:11.45]How much money?
[223:12.57]After I get paid another one or two times.
[223:25.37]He's quick too.
[223:26.43]Alright.
[223:26.87]I like this guy.
[223:30.21]That's a good idea.
[223:31.07]Putting this near the door.
[223:31.90]So I don't panic every time.
[223:43.53]So, if I put it near the door, then I will see them play, and then they'll leave.
[223:53.99]And I won't freak out about it.
[223:55.51]I'm into that.
[223:55.95]Yeah, because when I see somebody run out, it freaks me out.
[224:06.24]Put it over here.
[224:26.20]Come on.
[224:30.50]Is it weird that I'm just going to start hitting them in the head when I see them with bats?
[224:35.48]They just come in and do this.
[224:36.89]Like, what am I supposed to do?
[224:51.45]I need to have a bat just sitting right next to my desk.
[224:56.87]Alright, clean up.
[224:59.17]We're still open.
[224:59.85]There's still an arcade machine that works.
[225:06.14]Guards will take care of them.
[225:07.00]Okay, get this over here.
[225:10.02]Okay.
[225:17.35]Okay, put the table back.
[225:28.75]Maybe I should get a new LCD.
[225:31.05]Although, that thing was pretty good when I got it, though.
[225:32.68]Remember, I got a decent one, right?
[225:33.98]Okay.
[225:43.59]This keyboard over here.
[225:51.41]Okay.
[225:51.91]Pain in the ass.
[225:58.95]Pain in the behind.
[225:59.59]Sorry, I'm just upgrading something funny.
[226:21.06]Okay.
[226:23.22]Upgrade the building.
[226:23.96]You think I have money to upgrade the building?
[226:25.72]I have $400 to my name.
[226:32.46]my cafe okay a fun place that's good but I have 335 dollars and you do no swears for 30 minutes I could try it's possible I could try it my cafe upgrade page new room a kitchen okay for a new room I need 800 bucks kitchen is 1400 that's not that bad actually
[227:03.79]Old speakers.
[227:04.59]Oh, tip box.
[227:06.65]I'm getting it.
[227:14.52]We got a lot of customers now.
[227:22.44]We good?
[227:27.51]What if I can't afford...
[227:34.36]Get out of the way.
[227:34.76]Okay, I got to move this.
[227:39.70]I can't, I actually cannot leave.
[227:47.03]Right here is good.
[227:47.95]Okay, right there.
[227:57.21]The desk in the back.
[228:00.25]This feels really weirdly high.
[228:04.55]Rotate your disk to aim towards the front.
[228:10.00]Oh, I see what you mean.
[228:10.76]So move to actually put the desk in a better spot.
[228:12.58]Okay.
[228:17.69]I don't think I can move this desk.
[228:18.71]No, I can't.
[228:24.05]This desk is permanently here.
[228:42.30]It doesn't smell.
[228:43.00]It's fine.
[228:50.08]It's a little dirty, but it doesn't... Good work.
[228:55.75]Excellent job.
[228:58.05]That guy would have got away with it, too.
[229:07.89]Alright, clean it up.
[229:12.30]Got 185... How much do people tip, usually?
[229:17.77]Is it more than a few dollars?
[229:24.51]No, it stinks.
[229:25.29]It's not dirty.
[229:25.93]What are you... It doesn't... Oh, shit.
[229:28.55]Okay.
[229:34.95]Make sure you tip.
[229:42.77]Thanks.
[229:46.51]Let's go.
[229:47.79]Bingo.
[229:49.59]More money.
[229:50.37]More money.
[229:51.19]More money.
[229:55.85]More money.
[229:56.67]More money.
[230:02.95]More money.
[230:16.79]3D?
[230:18.23]No, I'm keeping my prices fair.
[230:19.95]Somebody was saying, dude, Jack your prices up like crazy.
[230:24.62]Very expensive.
[230:26.60]I want repeat customers.
[230:27.58]I want good reviews.
[230:28.26]You're going to owe about $500 in a couple minutes.
[230:35.87]I am.
[230:38.79]Hope I have it.
[230:39.99]Mm-hmm.
[230:45.95]I didn't run away, right?
[230:50.09]But high prices make people think it's worth more.
[230:52.39]That's actually, like, not... Is that, like, a crazy... That's, I don't know, that's so weird, but I think I, like, I'm gonna do it.
[231:15.58]I can't change the pro- I have to complete the setup first.
[231:17.38]Oh, it's because somebody's using it right now.
[231:20.66]People buy iPhones.
[231:21.56]I don't even know why they still have an iPhone every year.
[231:25.26]I don't get it.
[231:25.68]I mean, I do, but I don't at the same time.
[231:29.96]You know, I had the same exact theory about- the same opinion on, like, the fact that they turned iPhones into, like, Madden games.
[231:41.32]I don't know.
[231:41.90]All these companies just started releasing something every year that's the same thing.
[231:49.20]Like, every two years we have to have this release.
[231:51.28]It's like, why is the world all following the Madden formula?
[232:07.74]Alright.
[232:08.74]This is looking good.
[232:10.97]I'm thinking of buying another... Should I get another arcade cabinet or should I buy another room?
[232:20.97]I feel like I don't need another room right now.
[232:22.49]I feel like I don't want another room.
[232:23.69]I won't see more people stealing stuff.
[232:25.67]I'm gonna stay small.
[232:27.01]For now.
[232:34.33]Oh, you're done.
[232:41.32]Did somebody else run out?
[232:53.57]You know what really solidified this to my brain?
[232:57.05]WWE.
[232:59.61]The wrestling games.
[233:01.29]They turned it into a yearly Madden game.
[233:05.45]And my eyes were opened.
[233:09.26]Because that is the exact moment when those games started to be coming.
[233:14.04]Dog shit.
[233:16.34]My eyes.
[233:17.72]Just, I was, I came out of the matrix.
[233:20.33]And I was like, holy shit.
[233:29.87]Very good.
[233:30.51]No gambling.
[233:31.24]I told you I wasn't going to do it.
[233:32.12]The new one had more time.
[233:38.31]Yeah, I really hope that they learned.
[233:40.63]And you know what?
[233:41.55]I have said nothing nice and nothing good at all about the recent WWE games or like what I think about the development of those games.
[233:50.74]I have said nothing nice.
[233:52.26]It's all been bad.
[233:53.50]All of it.
[233:55.50]I will be happy if they actually took the couple, two, three years here to make the new one and it's good.
[234:01.23]If it's not good, if it's just as kind of bad and broken and shitty and backwards as the other ones,
[234:07.81]I don't even think I'm going to get it.
[234:10.73]I don't think I'm going to play it.
[234:13.82]I don't think it's going to happen.
[234:16.78]It's been over 30 minutes.
[234:17.52]It has you right.
[234:17.94]Let's gamble.
[234:19.52]No, I'm kidding.
[234:28.11]They've been yearly since 2000?
[234:36.98]No, no, I don't think so.
[234:40.19]Well, here's the thing.
[234:40.85]A bunch of companies used to make a bunch of these games.
[234:45.33]I don't know what happened, and this pisses me off too.
[234:47.73]There was a time back before like 2008, 2010, when more than one fucking company could make a video game based on a license, right?
[234:59.56]What happened was, yeah, there'd be a WWE game or WWF game every year, because like there would be three or four companies making these games.
[235:08.20]There'd be like three or four different studios making a WWF game.
[235:11.98]would be three or four different football games three or four different baseball games and now all these companies just have mega licenses that have lasted for the last 15 plus years that they're just the only person that makes the game and nobody else can I was a big baseball fan back in the day baseball game fan I remember mvp baseball was awesome
[235:40.32]And then when they got the license taken away and they could never make a game like that ever again, they just said, fuck it, we're never making a baseball game ever again.
[235:47.55]And their games were so good.
[235:50.03]The MVP baseball games were the best baseball games.
[235:54.06]No one comes close.
[235:55.24]Nobody comes even remote.
[235:56.42]No one comes close.
[235:57.58]And they never will.
[236:00.66]And they lost the license because of all the, well, we're going to get the exclusive baseball license to make a bunch of shitty baseball games in a row.
[236:07.02]And what's that?
[236:07.58]That's weird.
[236:08.70]It was 2K, right?
[236:09.67]Because it was the 2K baseball franchise.
[236:11.47]Because EA, wait a minute, hold on, there's a fire.
[236:16.61]Everybody hold on.
[236:18.79]It was a license war, right?
[236:21.23]Well, you guys are going to do the exclusive rights to football.
[236:24.51]We're going to do the exclusive rights to baseball.
[236:28.89]Why is everything on fire?
[236:30.61]Don't sit down.
[236:31.21]I'm not done doing this yet.
[236:37.42]Is this still burning?
[236:43.97]What's burning?
[236:46.09]Something's still on fire.
[236:46.95]What is it?
[236:59.92]Did I get it?
[237:00.38]Okay.
[237:02.31]Okay, so EA gets the exclusive licensing rights to Madden, like forever, right?
[237:08.17]And then 2K goes, oh yeah, we're gonna get exclusive rights to baseball, and then make just like five terrible baseball games in a row.
[237:16.02]I was so mad when that happened.
[237:17.60]I was, it was, it was inconsolable.
[237:29.67]MLB, the show is great, though.
[237:31.69]Yeah, I know.
[237:33.01]I know the show is good.
[237:34.22]Come on.
[237:43.72]Explainer Andy.
[238:03.31]That emote, I... He's laughing at TikToks again.
[238:09.07]I got TikToks up in the other monitor.
[238:10.61]I'm just laughing about them.
[238:17.68]Is it dirty?
[238:18.22]It is.
[238:20.02]Alright, is it time to expand?
[238:21.86]And turn into an arcade?
[238:28.94]Is it arcade time?
[238:39.28]You made a comment about apples yesterday and said you didn't like Honeycrisp.
[238:45.39]Um... Thank you.
[238:47.29]Good work.
[238:47.57]It's not that I don't like Honeycrisp.
[238:50.65]I just... I don't... I wouldn't buy them at the grocery store.
[238:59.51]I can't afford this yet.
[239:01.07]Um... Maybe I'll buy another arcade cabinet.
[239:08.70]What about... I think this does not look so ugly.
[239:12.36]These are kind of cool.
[239:16.32]I like this one.
[239:17.52]Let's do this.
[239:21.11]Ooh, nice.
[239:24.89]He's about to run.
[239:27.15]He's going after somebody.
[239:33.89]How come you don't just go back to the old WWE games?
[239:35.75]Well, because that's a very specific question and I have a very specific answer.
[239:40.11]The old WWE games are so slow.
[239:49.99]so slow it takes sometimes 10 to 20 30 plus seconds once you have too many layers on a wrestler like a creator wrestler to load even moving an inch to the left some asset it was it's on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and all that shit so it just it's on such old hardware that it just can't do it it can't run
[240:22.75]I could technically do it, but it's just... I thought he was running.
[240:28.55]What happened to the walls?
[240:34.10]I got new paint, and now it doesn't look like we're inside of a public bathroom.
[240:42.86]You're a millionaire.
[240:43.82]Hire somebody to make a wrestling game for you.
[240:48.43]I think you severely underestimate how much it costs to make a 3D video game.
[240:58.84]No, no, no, no, no.
[240:59.40]Sit down, sit down, sit down.
[241:10.64]I'm just sitting on money.
[241:12.58]Sitting on money.
[241:13.04]That's it.
[241:15.93]Gotta do.
[241:16.93]No, he knocked over the console.
[241:19.28]Oh, shit.
[241:21.16]It's okay, sir.
[241:21.86]I'll take care of that.
[241:23.12]Wow.
[241:24.24]Absolutely ridiculous that that happened.
[241:26.00]Here's two free coupons to our go-kart track.
[241:33.14]God damn it.
[241:46.69]Get, uh, hire somebody.
[241:47.57]I don't want to hire too many people before I blow all my money.
[241:57.92]How can we get a polar bear Fortnite dancing?
[241:59.88]Well... Actually, he's bringing in a lot of people.
[242:05.30]Way more people are coming here than were before.
[242:06.77]I'm getting another arcade cabinet.
[242:09.43]One of the nicer ones.
[242:18.92]What's a good one?
[242:23.42]Defender?
[242:26.74]Let's get Defender.
[242:27.83]Yeah.
[242:28.27]That's a three star arcade machine.
[242:32.03]Nice.
[242:32.35]Alright.
[242:35.57]Get a trash can.
[242:36.71]Is that the problem?
[242:37.47]Is that why I've just been permanently just being just sweep Andy?
[242:43.99]I broke that guy's neck an hour ago and it's still messed up.
[242:54.42]Oh, yeah.
[243:02.40]Um... Hold on.
[243:03.66]Right here.
[243:08.42]Is that actually what happened?
[243:13.76]Wait, I just got to pay.
[243:18.81]Thank you.
[243:20.09]Ooh, thanks for the tip.
[243:29.28]Did we just get a raid?
[243:29.76]Did we get a raid?
[243:30.26]Who raided?
[243:31.64]Oh, we did.
[243:32.98]Thank you, Sockpens, for the raid.
[243:37.22]Welcome, Sockpen.
[243:40.04]Playing internet cafe simulation expense business simulator.
[243:46.80]Welcome, everybody.
[243:49.32]How the- Are you?
[243:53.59]What do I have saved here?
[243:54.61]Whoa, man!
[243:55.85]What's this on the front page?
[243:58.92]I just saw that it was on the GoXLR.
[244:00.06]I didn't know what it was.
[244:05.30]How much is this one?
[244:05.88]50 bucks?
[244:06.14]Maybe let's get another one.
[244:08.49]Do I do... Wait, I have to be able to pay these guys.
[244:17.47]I'll try to pay... Should I pay... When do these guys actually get paid?
[244:24.26]When does that happen?
[244:25.18]How about...
[244:30.38]Can you read us an analog clock real quick?
[244:32.22]Yeah, sure.
[244:32.64]8, 19.
[244:32.87]Got it.
[244:33.27]There you go.
[244:43.75]When you hire them, they only last so- Oh, okay.
[244:45.91]So, I already paid for them.
[244:47.39]Okay.
[244:48.33]I get it.
[244:49.39]Makes sense.
[244:53.97]Makes sense.
[244:54.79]No, no.
[244:55.43]I was just- I was trying to click it right now.
[244:59.06]You didn't even need to do that to that guy.
[245:00.72]Well, it was a complete misunderstanding.
[245:02.12]I just had to literally just go, hey, I'm, I'm, I just, come here.
[245:13.21]The room stinks.
[245:14.17]The room does smell, but... Alright, I got people working here.
[245:18.75]I'm just gonna go... I'm gonna go buy a smell thingy.
[245:25.72]I'll be fine.
[245:32.08]How come he only has three?
[245:39.96]Trump's just doing push-ups over there.
[245:58.25]Alright, we're fine.
[246:05.99]Trash can.
[246:06.71]Right, right, right, right.
[246:07.71]Yes, yes, yes.
[246:08.29]Good idea.
[246:20.21]This is... Okay, I'm paying for this every day.
[246:24.97]What about the floor?
[246:25.67]Yeah, I'll... Okay.
[246:27.19]I need to get a trash can and then I'm gonna make the floor a different color.
[246:30.11]Okay.
[246:34.19]Floor...
[246:38.97]Nice.
[246:45.13]What?
[246:46.23]Okay.
[246:46.55]There.
[246:49.17]So, I need... What about an air conditioner?
[246:51.12]How much does this stuff cost?
[246:52.32]What's an air conditioner?
[246:55.90]People keep complaining about the heat and stuff.
[246:59.74]People... Wait.
[247:00.58]Can I get a heater?
[247:03.40]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[247:05.45]Or, how does this work?
[247:07.01]Does the air conditioner help?
[247:08.35]Because they're like, oh, it's so cold in here.
[247:09.99]Does this do it?
[247:10.73]I don't see a heater.
[247:11.51]Trash can first.
[247:14.26]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[247:16.78]Keyboards.
[247:17.88]Lambs?
[247:19.06]Lambs?
[247:20.68]House pad, paintings, desks, TVs.
[247:24.12]Where is it?
[247:27.01]It works for both?
[247:27.55]Alright, I'm going to get it.
[247:28.15]I don't think there is a trash can.
[247:35.00]I don't see one.
[247:47.13]Is it like a service?
[247:49.37]It's the cleaner.
[247:50.35]Wait, I got mail.
[247:50.85]One of our security is neutralize a thief.
[247:56.83]He's standing right next to me.
[248:05.65]Alright, so let me buy this first.
[248:11.21]So, if I go to... Like, the employment?
[248:18.99]Cleaner.
[248:19.35]600 bucks.
[248:21.15]That's so much.
[248:25.35]That's only for every three days?
[248:27.15]No, that's not worth it.
[248:36.72]Maybe it is.
[248:41.15]Maybe it is.
[248:41.69]I don't want anybody to steal that.
[248:57.78]There it is.
[248:58.04]Okay.
[249:01.96]So does it matter where I put this?
[249:05.00]Put it like right up here.
[249:08.79]Press F to direct to adjust air conditioner.
[249:12.11]Temperature.
[249:12.51]What should I do?
[249:16.01]Auto.
[249:16.73]The air temperature adjusted automatically.
[249:18.21]Yeah, okay, that's better.
[249:27.73]Back to clean.
[249:28.23]This has to... Yeah.
[249:29.32]Okay, this is empty.
[249:35.14]I'm going to throw all the empties over in the corner.
[249:39.72]And everything I can use on the desk.
[249:43.30]Why is it so cold in here?
[249:45.22]Didn't I just get this?
[249:47.22]Well, what are you doing?
[249:48.70]Oh, shit.
[250:01.43]Am I hitting it?
[250:11.99]I need another one of these now.
[250:14.06]And maybe even another PC.
[250:30.56]This girl has been here for days?
[250:32.03]She really has.
[250:36.41]You're right, she actually has been here for two- I mean, I can't- What is she doing?
[250:45.05]She has just been squaring up for a week.
[250:49.21]What's going on?
[250:49.97]Okay, I was just checking to see if she was squaring me up or if she was squaring up the bouncer.
[250:59.95]What do you want?
[251:04.17]What's the problem?
[251:09.22]Need a mascot back?
[251:10.54]Oh, you're right.
[251:11.36]Hold on, let me clean.
[251:12.08]Let me get cleaned up.
[251:27.47]Alright, that's clean.
[251:28.67]Clean enough.
[251:33.64]I do it.
[251:33.92]The mascot's right here.
[251:38.46]Stop him!
[251:39.88]Stop him!
[251:41.26]Stop this guy!
[251:42.06]Stop this guy!
[251:46.32]No!
[251:47.18]Alright.
[251:48.06]I'm sorry.
[251:48.94]There was a criminal in here.
[251:52.43]Where's the- oh.
[251:53.33]He stole the computer out of the- underneath where the guy was sitting.
[252:06.79]I'm still not gonna buy that.
[252:07.83]That's not worth it.
[252:12.59]The floor.
[252:13.11]The floor.
[252:13.43]The floor.
[252:13.77]Ah, wait.
[252:14.49]Somebody wants to... That ascot's bringing in too many people.
[252:16.82]I can't even do it.
[252:18.72]Fire extinguisher.
[252:19.34]Wait.
[252:19.58]I'm getting overwhelmed.
[252:20.18]Hold on.
[252:26.02]I'm getting overwhelmed.
[252:27.96]Don't overwhelm me.
[252:31.70]We're doing research.
[252:32.30]I'd like to know the length of your arm from your fingertip to your shoulder.
[252:34.78]Alright.
[252:35.88]How the fuck am I going to measure that?
[252:37.72]I don't know.
[252:39.26]One foot?
[252:39.76]Like two?
[252:40.16]Maybe like three feet?
[252:42.22]You said from my shoulder to my fingertip?
[252:43.72]I don't know.
[252:44.00]Three feet?
[252:45.36]I have no idea.
[252:48.86]Uh, floor.
[252:49.34]Right.
[252:49.54]Floor, floor, floor, floor, floor.
[252:51.78]Ooh, smoky.
[252:53.44]What a fucking idiot.
[252:54.28]I shouldn't have... I should have waited at least a second.
[252:59.94]That looks worse than the other one.
[253:03.60]How is that different?
[253:07.08]This looks worse.
[253:17.06]I would love to take your money.
[253:22.98]Oh, this one, the orangutan.
[253:39.03]I'm watching porn.
[253:39.85]Yeah, the people watch porn in here all the time.
[253:43.87]I can't really do much about it, if I'm honest.
[253:55.28]Hey, dude, did you find those arcade machines in the river?
[254:01.64]No.
[254:03.28]Speaking of arcade machines, I'm gonna go for another one.
[254:07.72]They're just really, really...
[254:19.38]Bananas.
[254:20.72]Bananas.
[254:22.78]Bananas.
[254:23.22]Strawberries.
[254:27.24]Oh, yes.
[254:27.98]Alright, we're good.
[254:32.80]One more.
[254:36.52]Peaches.
[254:38.70]Bananas.
[254:39.16]Strawberries.
[254:40.82]Okay, I'm done.
[254:41.81]That's it.
[254:47.33]What do you have, huh?
[254:50.75]I got requests.
[254:51.41]Get on here.
[254:58.55]Check on your Dogecoin.
[254:59.49]Good idea.
[255:04.56]Where is it?
[255:05.06]Oh, right here.
[255:05.62]Crypto.
[255:09.66]How many do I have?
[255:12.18]How many do I have?
[255:16.58]I wanted to sell five.
[255:17.54]Whatever.
[255:17.82]Whatever.
[255:21.16]There's no... Oh, fire extinguisher!
[255:28.60]Yeah, I said before 8.
[255:29.30]It's 8.30 right now.
[255:31.72]I went well past that.
[255:45.19]I got the bouncer.
[255:47.59]I thought he was just had enough for her once and for all.
[255:50.35]It was just a good dropper.
[256:22.30]You got McDonald's colors in your shop?
[256:29.10]You can't, I, um... Speaking of McDonald's, what?
[256:38.15]Speaking of McDonald's, I've updated my McDonald's order.
[256:41.13]Uh, one of... One of my mods said he got my old McDonald's order and he said he, like, had diarrhea.
[256:51.06]I was like, man, what are you talking about?
[256:52.96]You're eating all the shareables?
[256:58.36]What are you talking about?
[256:59.12]Those of you that don't know, I have a crazy McDonald's order where it's like three sandwiches, like nuggets, and the whole point is some of those items are to be shared.
[257:10.56]And he said he had diarrhea or something, so I was like, alright, let me update the order for you.
[257:18.07]My new McDonald's order that I get almost every time now.
[257:21.55]is two double cheeseburgers, 10-piece nugget, and a Powerade.
[257:28.04]And those are not necessarily to be shared.
[257:29.90]Sometimes they are.
[257:31.66]That's a lot of money.
[257:38.70]He's like, dude, I ate that McDonald's order you were talking about, man.
[257:41.27]It took me a long... I struggled to get through it.
[257:42.85]And I'm like, wait, you ate the whole thing by yourself?
[257:45.77]What about the shareables?
[257:47.47]He's like, shareables?
[257:48.21]What are you talking about?
[258:01.72]No, I always order a 10-piece nugget and maybe like an extra burger or so just for anybody that wants it.
[258:08.24]Just because I like when... I don't know.
[258:13.02]If I go out to eat and people are happy and eating and stuff, it's like, oh yeah, I got a 10-piece nugget.
[258:18.61]Anybody have one if you want them?
[258:19.97]Because nobody wants to order nuggets, right?
[258:22.99]The 10-piece nugget meal and even a 5-piece nugget with a drink never seems like enough.
[258:28.09]So I take that away from the person.
[258:30.29]I make it so they don't have to make that decision.
[258:33.31]So... Oh, dude, I really would love nuggets.
[258:36.04]They're available, man.
[258:37.40]They're just here.
[258:40.96]In my opinion...
[258:43.64]In my experience, most people don't want to just have nuggets and fries.
[258:51.26]Like, a five-piece nugget is an add-on to a lot of people's meals.
[258:54.50]So I'm like, let me take that out of your hands.
[258:56.10]I got it.
[258:56.38]How much money do I have?
[259:11.94]Alright, hell yeah.
[259:12.98]I think it's time for another arcade cabinet.
[259:15.96]Last arcade cabinet.
[259:16.94]This is the final one.
[259:18.66]After this cabinet comes in, I'm going to just coast until I can buy the room upgrade.
[259:28.09]What's the best one here?
[259:29.25]One of these is good.
[259:29.95]Maybe this one?
[259:32.47]We have to have variety, right?
[259:33.39]I'll get this one.
[259:36.27]And I'll buy another Steam game.
[259:40.73]Maybe, like, the Shrek one?
[259:42.47]Alright, let's coast.
[259:46.05]Nice.
[259:52.70]Check your portfolio balance in crypto.
[259:59.32]Okay.
[260:08.51]Okay.
[260:10.88]Portfolio.
[260:11.74]Dogecoin.
[260:13.46]Alright.
[260:14.18]How many do I have?
[260:15.20]15.
[260:16.96]Sell.
[260:17.88]Nice.
[260:18.80]I made $4.
[260:19.34]Actually, I made like 30 cents.
[260:25.73]A trash can.
[260:26.55]There's no such thing as a trash can in this game.
[260:33.73]This is actually the last thing I can probably do before I upgrade the building.
[260:37.85]I'm running out of room.
[260:49.07]This is straight up 90... Yeah, this is 90 bucks.
[260:56.06]I'd say every, pretty much every hour, we get 90 bucks here in the arcade cabinets.
[261:08.16]The next thing, I promise the next thing I do will be a cleaning upgrade.
[261:13.00]Update the floor?
[261:13.80]I already did.
[261:14.48]It's a different floor.
[261:15.20]It just looks like shit.
[261:16.16]I'm sorry.
[261:17.26]Holy shit, I haven't saved the game in a long time.
[261:26.31]You're right.
[261:39.94]You are right.
[261:46.30]If it's the same floor, then why did it cost $200 to put down here?
[261:49.60]Where's the rest of this dirt?
[262:04.97]Don't get scared!
[262:05.80]Oh, he ran off.
[262:18.73]X, Q, C, L. Okay.
[262:37.34]I'm sorry that there was a guy that ran in here.
[262:40.04]The arcade machine is nice and clean, ready for you.
[262:45.47]Maybe I should get a better PC now.
[262:47.25]No, stick to the plan.
[263:00.33]Oh, God.
[263:03.67]Customers running away without paying is reduced.
[263:07.39]You may ask for extra time.
[263:09.25]What else we got?
[263:10.65]You're known around because of your old history and thieves don't come to your shop much.
[263:17.02]Stamina.
[263:18.02]What else do we have?
[263:18.62]Let me see if it's all the way down.
[263:19.56]I don't really care that much about this.
[263:22.04]Stamina.
[263:25.48]Boxing.
[263:26.04]I have the bouncer.
[263:30.72]Body, what's all the way?
[263:32.82]Please don't suspect you and all the physical stuff I don't really care about.
[263:36.02]What the fuck?
[263:39.40]Put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down.
[263:42.12]Where's the extinguisher?
[263:57.49]Hey.
[263:58.83]Nice.
[263:59.09]Alright.
[264:00.19]Um... I think I'm just gonna keep doing the cafe stuff.
[264:04.62]That feels like the best idea.
[264:12.26]This one.
[264:13.74]Extra time.
[264:16.34]Tip box.
[264:17.02]People leave more money in the tip box.
[264:18.66]Oh, yeah.
[264:20.90]Nice.
[264:21.66]That's good.
[264:29.00]stop rushing I do need to say alright so I gotta close close up the shop why have you seen people wishing for a crash yeah we're officially closed save the game
[265:03.40]Autocontext.
[265:05.56]I can't.
[265:05.88]I don't want to alt tab right now, but on the autocontext Twitter, it's something funny.
[265:10.90]Alright.
[265:15.36]Get him!
[265:21.65]We're closed.
[265:22.31]I don't even think about it.
[265:32.58]Close it up.
[265:34.49]How do I tell him to go home?
[265:36.35]Will he just stay and protect this place?
[265:40.95]Most people have said your store is the same as it was hours ago.
[265:43.25]You're better than this.
[265:46.61]I think it's changed pretty drastically.
[265:48.85]I've got three arcade cabinets.
[265:50.13]I'm about to do a second floor.
[265:51.94]Or a second... A second room.
[265:55.12]That's the next thing we're doing.
[266:06.14]Yeah, I tried to punch the panda in the face.
[266:08.11]Yeah, I did.
[266:14.29]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[266:26.82]Go back and finish the job.
[266:27.92]I'm good.
[266:36.36]Priority is to get a new room.
[266:37.71]We're going to have an arcade cabinet room.
[266:41.11]Besides the arcade cabinet room, there's going to be a console room.
[266:43.59]Yeah, we're going to split it up.
[266:46.52]I got a plan.
[266:47.02]Don't worry.
[266:49.54]At least I hope I do.
[267:04.04]You can go to the club now.
[267:05.08]I can go to the club, you're right.
[267:07.20]Is it TOS?
[267:23.23]Is it TOS?
[267:29.71]There are slot machines in there?
[267:30.80]Oh, nice.
[267:32.91]Alright.
[267:33.09]Time to get a second room.
[267:49.71]Okay.
[267:52.95]Hmm.
[267:58.23]What do I do?
[267:58.99]No, I'll do this first.
[268:00.89]I have enough to buy it.
[268:01.53]I got 900 bucks.
[268:04.01]My cafe.
[268:05.63]New room.
[268:06.75]I officially have a new room.
[268:08.23]Is it just here?
[268:08.73]It just made the... It just made it longer.
[268:18.27]Um... Well, I guess I'll put these back here?
[268:24.80]Nah, alright.
[268:26.68]We're closed.
[268:35.25]East to it, going in the back.
[268:37.59]That's the easiest way to do it.
[268:45.43]Okay.
[268:46.39]They should be able to fit back to back, right?
[268:47.83]I'm going to put this up here, right in the middle.
[269:04.06]Auto-adjust.
[269:08.71]Please get a new chair.
[269:09.57]Yeah, I have this.
[269:10.07]I do have this plastic lawn chair.
[269:12.24]You're right.
[269:12.58]I'll do that in a second, too.
[269:17.48]I'll take you.
[269:22.00]That's much better.
[269:22.60]There we go.
[269:40.03]Like that.
[269:41.25]Wait, is that the wrong way?
[269:42.19]Nope.
[269:44.20]It's a huge improvement.
[269:45.12]It really is.
[269:46.00]It took me so long to be able to comfortably pay $800.
[269:47.78]If you're new to the channel, one of the things you have to kind of keep in mind is if it takes an hour to do something in a game, you need to add in brackets like two hours.
[270:06.23]So it takes three hours.
[270:09.68]I get so distracted.
[270:14.72]I'm like the most distractible person probably in the world.
[270:22.24]Let's get another chair and let's get two more chairs.
[270:27.72]We'll just have these.
[270:28.58]Two of those.
[270:30.54]I got enough money, right?
[270:31.12]I think.
[270:34.34]No, I don't.
[270:34.74]I don't have enough money.
[270:35.57]I'll have to do it later.
[270:47.85]Bombs.
[270:53.86]Am I ever going to see a return on this?
[270:55.62]Ever.
[271:01.41]That's a huge improvement, though.
[271:02.39]It really is.
[271:11.64]Wait, what'd you say?
[271:13.74]xQc spent two full hours gambling until he had zero without ever setting up his cafe and then he quit the game.
[271:29.52]My streamer.
[271:38.39]Alright, let's go.
[271:39.11]Clean up.
[271:47.65]I gotta buy a different mouse.
[271:48.99]This just looks like a bar of dirty soap.
[272:01.78]That's good.
[272:02.56]I need a second chair.
[272:04.85]This is ugly.
[272:05.51]It needs to be changed.
[272:06.55]How about just, like, right here?
[272:09.13]Like, along this wall.
[272:15.51]This game's fun.
[272:27.40]Like that.
[272:28.40]Uh, what's wrong?
[272:36.03]Uh, why can't I put this here?
[272:38.69]Too far?
[272:39.01]Hmm?
[272:40.49]Okay.
[272:49.39]I need a lamp?
[272:50.78]What do I mean?
[272:51.08]The light.
[272:51.44]The light.
[272:51.76]The light.
[272:53.44]Oh.
[272:55.88]Oh!
[272:56.16]Alright, yep.
[273:01.85]There.
[273:04.24]How come you're creating an arcade in a crack den?
[273:07.32]I don't know.
[273:07.60]Because it's fun.
[273:19.47]Okay.
[273:23.77]I think I'm ready to open the place.
[273:26.41]I have enough.
[273:27.45]We can just coast for a little bit.
[273:32.36]I don't have any money.
[273:36.76]Electricity needs to be... It's on, right?
[273:38.50]Yep.
[273:38.84]Alright.
[273:41.94]Back in business.
[273:42.50]Let's go.
[273:47.58]This is kind of nice.
[273:49.84]Look it.
[273:51.84]Three or four more arcade cabinets down here.
[273:56.02]Upgrade.
[273:56.26]Maybe get a kitchen eventually here in the next half hour probably.
[273:58.76]Get a new floor.
[274:01.67]It's clean.
[274:02.65]It smells good in here.
[274:03.47]I think.
[274:05.35]It does.
[274:05.65]Is this empty?
[274:09.02]No.
[274:18.20]It's a more light, so it looks bigger.
[274:24.07]What do these other... Let me see what they look like.
[274:26.21]I haven't paid my bills in like a month.
[274:29.45]I don't know.
[274:30.57]We're fine.
[274:42.04]Hey.
[274:43.16]How come there's no street audio?
[274:47.68]I don't know.
[274:50.84]I don't know.
[274:51.48]What do you mean we're fine?
[274:58.43]You have $40 to your name right now.
[275:00.07]But... I have... A income stream here.
[275:06.93]That's about to probably get pretty good.
[275:09.79]I'm a ha-ha.
[275:20.90]Wait, new quest.
[275:24.48]Dude, there's a big fight.
[275:25.55]Can you bring me three baseball bats?
[275:28.49]Okay.
[275:28.61]I mean, I was going to buy them.
[275:33.17]Is that okay?
[275:33.63]Okay.
[275:41.03]Thanks.
[275:54.23]Okay, do I have enough to buy three bats?
[275:55.63]Because I'll probably get some money from this.
[275:57.25]Uh, it's 44.8.
[275:57.75]Okay, one more person leaving and I should be good to go.
[276:00.63]Somebody said read the reviews.
[276:04.91]Oh, good idea.
[276:17.04]Okay.
[276:21.45]What do I want to do here?
[276:22.17]What was I going to do?
[276:23.25]Trash can is in the cafe upgrades.
[276:26.61]Is it really?
[276:26.97]Kitchen, toilet, upstairs, upstairs.
[276:31.23]I don't see anything.
[276:34.34]Hot dog cart.
[276:35.58]Sliding doors, speakers.
[276:37.00]Burglar alarm.
[276:39.98]POS device.
[276:40.72]Piece of shit device?
[276:43.26]Where is it?
[276:51.19]I need to read my reviews?
[276:52.27]Alright, let's read the reviews.
[276:56.15]Great place to experience the life of Eskimos.
[276:58.49]It's so cold, I ran away immediately.
[277:01.45]Don't I have it on the auto temperature?
[277:03.52]Why is it doing that?
[277:09.80]It's so cold in here.
[277:11.40]It's like the Eskimos.
[277:13.46]Except for the times when it's a fire every 10 minutes.
[277:18.11]Did you just write that review?
[277:19.47]Is it you that wrote that?
[277:26.21]Isn't this on auto?
[277:32.94]How?
[277:33.42]What temperature do you want it?
[277:34.48]Nice little tip.
[277:52.11]One more time?
[277:52.61]Alright.
[278:05.54]Buy a backpack when you can afford it.
[278:06.68]You can store items in your bag.
[278:07.80]Oh, that's so much better.
[278:08.62]That's like a hundred thousand times better.
[278:11.10]My dog vomited when I turned on your stream.
[278:19.67]Hopefully you're okay.
[278:26.27]In the private mission, I know a better place.
[278:27.66]Their games are the last quality.
[278:29.12]However, they don't open.
[278:29.92]Computers are shit.
[278:31.76]Like shit.
[278:33.30]I need new PCs.
[278:34.88]Or something.
[278:35.42]I don't know.
[278:35.90]A new computer?
[278:41.16]How much is a decent PC?
[278:42.12]Computers.
[278:49.43]Where are they?
[278:52.85]Thank you.
[278:55.58]What about VR?
[278:56.40]Should I have a VR room?
[279:00.88]Oh, it's cases, right?
[279:01.72]Okay.
[279:03.06]Fast computer?
[279:03.86]How about, okay, what about this one?
[279:07.06]This is a decent computer.
[279:08.46]Let's get it.
[279:10.64]I'll sell the other one right now.
[279:16.68]Buy more CSGO cases.
[279:18.04]I was a big fan of this game, too.
[279:27.42]Are you watching?
[279:29.86]Yeah, I used to watch this channel.
[279:32.68]I really hate to do this to you, but... What can I get for this computer? $100?
[279:57.17]Wait, I need something else from you, don't I?
[279:58.27]Do I?
[280:06.91]I'm going to these cool... No, that's way too expensive.
[280:08.80]Are you crazy?
[280:12.34]Oh, bats, right.
[280:16.94]Um, where is... Let me track him down.
[280:34.04]I need to be here for this because this is a delivery.
[280:36.15]I'll just store them in here.
[280:37.97]Alright, that's much better.
[280:44.03]Better computer, better reviews.
[280:49.37]There we go.
[280:50.09]Alright.
[280:51.13]You can play better games.
[280:52.13]I'll buy a new game now too.
[280:54.13]Let's get, um, let's see.
[280:55.55]What should I get?
[281:01.29]Helmet Boy?
[281:05.11]Is this a porn game?
[281:06.49]Okay.
[281:22.84]I mean, the porn stuff is popular.
[281:25.40]I'm not going to deny the... I mean, look at how many people have come in and just started watching porn.
[281:30.51]If I get a porn game, I think they're going to play it a lot.
[281:39.78]That's so weird.
[281:40.95]It's not.
[281:41.39]No, it's not weird.
[281:41.99]It's business.
[281:48.63]This is business.
[282:04.49]Hey, better.
[282:04.99]Alright, nice.
[282:05.97]Can you turn the computer away so we don't just see the porn?
[282:17.22]I'll tell you when it's coming.
[282:18.00]Just close your eyes.
[282:33.85]Okay, how much money do I have?
[282:36.46]What is the next cool upgrade we can do?
[282:39.48]I can do a kitchen.
[282:40.46]A bathroom is $1,300.
[282:42.44]Upstairs is $2,400.
[282:43.42]Probably a kitchen, right?
[282:45.40]That seems like the logical point of sale.
[282:47.82]Is self-checkout.
[282:49.90]Hmm.
[282:54.42]That's not a bad idea.
[282:59.88]Floor, for the love of God.
[283:00.76]Alright, fine.
[283:01.46]I'll get a new floor right now.
[283:10.80]Floor.
[283:12.32]How about this one?
[283:14.44]This one's blue.
[283:15.04]This one's nice.
[283:20.90]This one's very neutral.
[283:21.92]It's fine.
[283:26.26]I like this one.
[283:26.72]This one's very neutral.
[283:27.46]Why does it look so bad?
[283:41.63]This is not blue!
[283:45.41]Why does it look like this?
[283:59.79]How come it's all beat up looking?
[284:00.83]Do I have to clean it somehow?
[284:02.65]What do I have to do?
[284:04.53]Why is this ugly?
[284:24.69]Okay.
[284:27.36]Okay.
[284:29.50]Okay.
[284:31.36]New floor.
[284:32.12]I spent 400 bucks on these floors.
[284:33.68]No.
[284:33.74]I could have bought another arcade cabinet.
[284:50.21]Hello.
[284:51.42]Hello.
[284:59.21]I swear to god if these are about how cold it is.
[285:00.75]Please warm the inside.
[285:01.83]I want to be warm.
[285:08.18]How do I make it so it doesn't smell?
[285:11.26]Is it even turned on?
[285:18.29]Was it not turned on?
[285:30.62]Views are like shit.
[285:32.37]Alright, I'm running out of... How could it get so dirty?
[285:40.95]Auto does not work and it wasn't turned on.
[285:45.80]So... Okay.
[285:50.94]More arcade machines.
[285:53.24]Okay, that was weird.
[286:01.48]Alright, the next step is going to be... What should the next step be?
[286:12.18]You want more time?
[286:12.72]Alright.
[286:17.18]In the arcade machines.
[286:19.42]I don't think I can clean them.
[286:20.72]Alright, let's go.
[286:29.34]Please warm, please warm.
[286:33.33]Use the mop.
[286:37.57]I need nicer arcade machines.
[286:43.40]Please, I'm begging you.
[286:44.36]Get a nicer trash.
[286:45.42]Where's my mop?
[286:50.82]I need to get spray.
[286:59.92]Getting spray.
[287:01.12]I need another fire extinguisher.
[287:09.25]Your AC's not even on.
[287:10.43]It's not?
[287:18.45]No, that's on.
[287:19.29]How hot should it be?
[287:30.62]This doesn't do anything.
[287:40.33]Is there a sliding door?
[287:46.86]Maybe shortly.
[287:54.34]You need a door for the AC to work?
[287:56.08]Are you kidding me?
[287:59.26]What's the cheapest door I can get?
[288:07.77]No, it's in the other menu.
[288:12.68]Okay, items.
[288:13.30]It's $1,200.
[288:13.42]$1,260 for this?
[288:13.64]What the fuck is going on?
[288:41.24]Why is it not on?
[288:50.28]Green means off?
[288:51.40]No, red means off.
[288:53.08]Green means go.
[288:54.22]Green means on.
[288:55.56]Green, it's on.
[288:56.78]Red, off.
[289:21.83]AC and heater.
[289:22.85]Yeah, they're the same thing.
[289:32.88]27 is way too hot.
[289:35.24]That's 80 degrees.
[289:39.94]Oh, shit.
[289:42.46]How's that?
[289:42.84]Is that alright?
[289:48.34]Imagine just blaring a heater non-stop up to 80 degrees.
[289:53.29]You have it set and you have your just front door wide open.
[290:02.91]Ooh, smart scan completed.
[290:03.95]Alright, now that I have a second here, I'm going to give this bat to the guy and go get another one.
[290:16.54]Where is he?
[290:22.83]Is it this guy right here?
[290:25.52]What?
[290:25.74]Uh-huh.
[290:34.33]Isn't it you?
[290:34.77]It's not you?
[290:51.24]You need to hold three in the backpack.
[290:53.39]Okay, so I need the backpack, right?
[290:54.83]We good?
[291:05.06]I got almost a thousand bucks.
[291:06.18]I got the employee app, maybe.
[291:10.86]Yeah, let's try that.
[291:15.93]Alright, please.
[291:17.91]Guard, cleaner.
[291:19.11]I could do cleaner, but I'm... Finally broke a thousand dolls the first time.
[291:25.48]I'm doing it.
[291:34.38]Get speakers?
[291:36.98]I'm so glad they can't do that.
[291:37.93]They just get stomped when they come in.
[291:41.23]When they go out.
[291:41.67]I don't have to do anything.
[291:43.67]It's awesome.
[291:47.46]I don't have to worry about it.
[291:48.18]Okay.
[291:58.26]I like cold places.
[291:58.92]It didn't bother me.
[291:59.48]A little cold.
[292:00.00]It's a little cold inside.
[292:01.12]How is that?
[292:02.46]I don't... If you sleep, the AC will work.
[292:06.38]The AC's bugged.
[292:07.48]Okay.
[292:08.04]Is that what the... I mean, it's... That's, like, hot.
[292:16.64]Oh shit!
[292:17.24]That just freaked- I had no idea what that thing was.
[292:18.88]Cool, alright.
[292:25.14]Alright, I'm gonna save it.
[292:26.16]After these people are gone, I'm gonna close it up and save.
[292:28.06]Priority tomorrow in the game is to get a point of sale.
[292:41.47]You know how hot 27 Celsius is?
[292:43.57]No, I go by Fahrenheit.
[292:53.21]Shit, I missed it.
[292:57.05]Door.
[292:57.43]I got the trash gone.
[292:58.65]Now I need a door and a point of sale.
[293:08.40]Who just got punched?
[293:10.60]I don't know.
[293:10.98]I'm going to bed.
[293:18.77]Good night.
[293:19.07]Thanks for the stream.
[293:19.57]See you next time.
[293:20.05]Hey, see you next time.
[293:22.67]27 is warm.
[293:25.70]Come on.
[293:32.52]Alright.
[293:34.44]Should I gamble for a minute?
[293:35.66]Just for a minute.
[293:39.87]Not the slot machine.
[293:41.53]I'm talking like CSGO skin.
[293:43.77]I'm doing it.
[293:46.77]Oh, it's a regular knife.
[293:48.85]One more, that's it.
[293:49.53]I'm never doing it again, I promise.
[293:52.69]I got my money back.
[293:53.25]Do it one more time.
[293:56.15]Alright, I'm done.
[293:57.10]Not doing it again.
[294:00.78]Okay.
[294:00.88]Those speakers.
[294:13.59]I have a huge money stream.
[294:15.19]I'm fine.
[294:26.00]Yeah, alright, everybody out.
[294:26.94]I'm closed.
[294:27.36]Thanks for coming.
[294:29.34]I appreciate the business and everything.
[294:31.88]But, that's it.
[294:33.55]This thing is bugged.
[294:48.81]Thank you.
[294:49.21]Have a great day.
[294:52.36]Appreciate it.
[294:54.79]Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[294:58.85]Store is closed.
[294:59.45]Okay, save the game.
[295:00.33]I'm going to come back.
[295:01.03]Somebody said I was bugged.
[295:01.77]Did I trap somebody in there?
[295:06.62]I need to buy speakers.
[295:11.74]Yeah, I'll get speakers.
[295:20.38]Slots can actually get you a bonus that's worth several thousand dollars.
[295:23.78]It's actually not bad to do it.
[295:27.28]Yeah, you gotta hit it though.
[295:31.66]You actually have to hit it.
[295:49.13]Save and then gamble.
[295:53.33]No, I got a plan.
[295:55.09]We talked about it already.
[295:55.91]I already know what I want.
[296:03.61]Oh.
[296:07.55]Just gamble on fruit slots with a really low bet and just do it a bunch.
[296:11.39]Because the bonus can pay a lot.
[296:15.54]You have a tuber voice right now.
[296:18.30]Alright, what you just did is you just did the manual breathing thing to me.
[296:23.60]Like, hey dude, you're manually breathing.
[296:25.50]And she's like, god damn it, am I?
[296:28.02]Shit.
[296:40.01]By gambling upgrades?
[296:45.51]You just did that to 18,000 people.
[296:48.03]No, I'm just saying.
[296:51.61]Saying that to me is the equivalent of the manual breathing thing.
[297:01.75]I think you guys had it wrong, because listen.
[297:06.10]I can hear air coming out.
[297:09.76]I think this is on.
[297:10.44]See?
[297:16.72]See?
[297:22.08]That's on.
[297:31.94]Yeah, it's definitely on.
[297:36.24]Okay, let's do this now.
[297:37.95]400 bucks.
[297:42.83]Can I do anything else in the meantime?
[297:44.11]I'm not doing that again.
[297:53.26]Forget about the chairs.
[297:54.80]Yeah, I'll get some chairs.
[298:07.45]I don't know what this is, but maybe I'll get it.
[298:15.51]Check with the thermometer.
[298:16.39]Yeah.
[298:23.39]Where is the thermometer?
[298:29.35]It's finally on.
[298:30.31]From 15 to 17 Celsius, finally.
[298:34.20]Damn.
[298:53.04]Speakers.
[298:53.50]How much are they?
[298:56.77]$4.90.
[298:57.01]I'll probably get it in a minute.
[299:00.77]I could do some claw machine as well.
[299:05.58]Oh, this guy.
[299:05.94]Wait, wait, wait.
[299:06.54]Can I give it to him?
[299:09.36]One sec.
[299:10.70]Get out of the fucking way.
[299:15.92]Where is he?
[299:17.97]There.
[299:18.15]Can I hand this in?
[299:23.38]Yeah, you're right.
[299:23.98]I gotta be able to carry three.
[299:35.89]Ooh.
[299:37.01]Activate them.
[299:43.81]62 degrees is freezing?
[299:45.01]Is that what 17 is?
[299:56.92]I do need a spray can.
[299:57.68]It probably smells in here.
[300:06.43]Yeah.
[300:06.83]It definitely stinks in here.
[300:07.73]17 is not freezing.
[300:11.03]Here.
[300:17.44]Here.
[300:29.60]Yeah, freezing is zero, huh?
[300:34.75]Good stop.
[300:44.69]Thank you.
[300:47.80]Thank you.
[300:49.88]How much is a backpack?
[300:50.60]21 or 22?
[300:52.32]Okay.
[300:52.50]Okay.
[300:58.60]I'll do 22.
[300:59.04]I like it a little warm.
[301:03.44]Activate this guy's computer.
[301:05.22]And then go get a backpack.
[301:13.61]I turned it off?
[301:16.61]Okay.
[301:28.34]I see this one star up there.
[301:30.10]Can you get more than one star?
[301:37.24]Can you get a chase by the police and everything?
[301:41.07]I keep seeing one star.
[301:44.23]Alright, backpack.
[301:46.63]$475,000.
[301:47.15]I don't have that much money.
[301:48.41]Can I get this one?
[301:53.11]Alright.
[301:53.97]Build.
[301:54.15]Build.
[301:56.50]What am I doing?
[301:58.44]Build.
[302:01.68]Where do I put this?
[302:14.04]Oh, okay.
[302:17.74]Very cool.
[302:21.49]Can I do anything else in the cafe list?
[302:23.15]Probably this one.
[302:26.09]I mean, I might as well just buy it, right?
[302:27.57]How do I get one more point?
[302:40.52]Do I just punch somebody?
[302:43.50]I didn't get a point.
[302:54.36]What's the point if you have a bouncer?
[302:55.38]That's a good- Yeah, that's true.
[303:04.81]Exactly.
[303:05.19]See, what's the point?
[303:19.88]What if- What's the very, very end of, like, the cafe list?
[303:24.94]Your knowledge of mining equipment has increased.
[303:26.64]You can now buy more mining devices.
[303:28.77]Sometimes in the casino, you have the possibility of getting back the bet you lost.
[303:32.95]That's actually huge.
[303:39.25]I'll get this one.
[303:41.37]I get extra luck in gambling?
[303:43.19]Are you serious?
[303:55.29]I need the point of- yeah, I'll get- that's true.
[303:57.05]But I just bought the backpack, so... What has more priority?
[304:10.63]Door?
[304:12.95]Or, um, point of sale?
[304:15.65]I'm gonna say point of sale.
[304:18.37]Is door really that much more important?
[304:20.73]I have a- a bouncer.
[304:33.15]Yeah, point of sale is way more important.
[304:36.51]The bouncer is just roundhouse kicking people in the fucking head.
[304:38.86]And we're good.
[304:41.48]I think we're good.
[304:42.56]I think we're good.
[304:45.16]The only thing I have to worry about is the people that run in and just throw an explosion in here.
[304:52.30]Yeah, I'm getting point of sale.
[304:54.75]Because I'm so bad and so ADHD about actually taking money from people and stuff, so.
[305:02.98]Okay, that's a should be good
[305:33.05]How do I use this?
[305:38.69]What can I do this with?
[305:42.30]Fun place.
[305:42.86]I like cold places.
[305:43.80]I like it cold.
[305:44.46]Even the owner of this place, he opened... Yeah, whatever.
[305:46.44]It's cold.
[305:46.82]It's cold.
[305:47.14]It's cold.
[305:47.46]It's cold.
[305:47.76]It's cold.
[305:48.02]Nothing I can do about it.
[305:50.70]It's for the Bitcoin stuff, though.
[305:54.58]You see, I need the point of sale so bad.
[305:56.72]He's gonna get kicked in the head, and that's not even his fault.
[306:01.91]The door.
[306:02.29]Idiot.
[306:04.11]I'm going to try.
[306:05.29]I have to pick a... The door is 1,200.
[306:16.40]I'm getting points to help right now.
[306:25.28]Where is it?
[306:27.36]Insufficient.
[306:27.96]Why?
[306:29.90]What?
[306:30.06]I thought I just had enough.
[306:34.12]I want to say we'll get you more money.
[306:35.14]Yeah.
[306:36.48]I keep missing it.
[306:44.95]Well, maybe I will just save for the door.
[306:46.41]I think door friends, I think, are outvoting the piece of shit friends.
[306:57.52]Can you play Nancy Drew ever again?
[306:59.96]I don't know.
[307:03.36]I'm not going to say I'm going to deny ever playing Nancy Drew ever again.
[307:07.36]Why wouldn't I?
[307:07.78]I think it's pretty fun.
[307:19.03]What did you say?
[307:20.29]Is it unreasonable to make my mayo have a little bit of crunch?
[307:23.92]Nah, man, whatever.
[307:25.60]People dip their french fries in mayo.
[307:27.58]It's an English thing, right?
[307:34.45]Almost there.
[307:35.15]Almost time for the door.
[307:35.85]Nasty, really?
[307:44.97]My point of sale, I don't, I'm not even collecting people's money.
[307:48.21]My point of sale is the bottom of my bouncer's shoe.
[307:53.41]I feel like that's, that's kind of fucked up.
[308:00.16]I feel like crunchy mayo actually would be kind of good.
[308:03.73]Okay, this crunchy peanut butter, what if there was crunchy mayo?
[308:06.39]How would that even work?
[308:11.14]Is that disgusting?
[308:13.74]Is that too far?
[308:16.84]That's, yeah, that's a little gross, you're right.
[308:21.14]It's eggshells.
[308:22.26]Ugh!
[308:25.04]What the fuck?
[308:27.60]You want more time?
[308:28.10]No, you're good.
[308:33.75]I could go for an egg salad sandwich right now.
[308:39.05]I've been like for five hours.
[308:40.33]I have not even been paying that much attention to that.
[308:47.88]A fresh egg salad sandwich is up there pretty high with everything else.
[308:55.42]Spicy mayo is good, yeah.
[309:03.41]Will you hurry up and get off the computer?
[309:06.37]And see, again, now she's gonna get kicked.
[309:08.19]You think in people's reviews, they would start to write this.
[309:20.86]Hey, make sure you give the guy at the counter a little bit more time.
[309:26.00]Because if you leave without paying because he won't take your money, you get your ass kicked outside.
[309:38.72]Almost there.
[309:39.32]I'll have it tomorrow.
[309:45.60]Or just like leave it on the table.
[309:46.80]I don't know.
[309:48.60]Leave the money on the table.
[309:49.66]Alright.
[309:52.18]Save the game.
[309:52.64]Close up.
[309:54.22]I'll be able to get a door tomorrow.
[309:55.38]Hooray.
[309:55.84]Wow.
[309:56.14]$1,200 for a fucking door.
[310:05.32]Good night, Defender.
[310:07.57]Good night, Galaga.
[310:09.89]Good night, GameBox.
[310:12.71]Good night, PlayStation 1.
[310:17.58]I'm sorry.
[310:20.86]Good night, Bouncer.
[310:23.26]Good night, Piggy.
[310:52.07]Say goodnight to the panda.
[310:55.35]I did, didn't I?
[311:04.48]Goodnight, Otto.
[311:06.94]Oh, Otto!
[311:20.71]Door is number one priority.
[311:22.13]I really shouldn't have even got the backpack.
[311:23.49]That was 500 bucks that I didn't need to spend.
[311:36.81]That was a cool relatable streamer.
[311:43.33]Yeah, I know.
[311:43.83]I know it wasn't very good.
[311:55.32]can complete the bat quest with the backpack.
[311:57.14]Can I though?
[311:58.35]I guess I could hold one in my hand and then two.
[312:01.15]Wait, let me do that now then.
[312:13.66]Oh, I can.
[312:14.24]You're right.
[312:14.60]Alright.
[312:15.18]No, I'm corrected.
[312:16.38]You're right.
[312:31.03]Alright.
[312:32.53]One more bat.
[312:38.14]Right over here somewhere.
[312:39.04]Nice.
[312:43.00]Alright.
[312:43.22]Do I get money for this?
[312:46.58]That'd be great, because then I can put the door in immediately.
[312:48.26]Man, I'm sorry, but I don't have money to give you right now, but don't worry, I'll make it up.
[312:54.96]Dude, there's an internet cafe owner in the city who doesn't listen to my word.
[312:58.52]Everyone in this city listens to my word.
[313:00.43]What I'm asking you to do is place this bugging device under his desk.
[313:03.93]It's located on the second floor of the building where you live.
[313:06.57]Place the bug behind the rival internet cafe table.
[313:13.53]Huh?
[313:16.83]Wait, it's where I live?
[313:26.66]Is this a rival internet cafe?
[313:28.04]I'm gonna need one of these.
[313:30.18]So this is what- this is what the second floor is then, okay.
[313:43.91]Okay.
[313:55.70]Can we play VRChat together?
[313:56.70]I want to show you my SpongeBob avatar.
[314:01.15]I don't really do VR too much.
[314:03.99]One hour for free.
[314:05.53]Alright, this is your little... Oh, nice.
[314:10.77]Where'd you get those computers from?
[314:13.36]Those are the computers they still use at the bank, by the way.
[314:15.60]Hi, Jerma985 here.
[314:18.02]I run a different operating business down the street.
[314:20.54]How are you?
[314:31.22]Did I miss or can I not?
[314:35.20]Smash it up.
[314:36.84]I don't think I can... Oh, wait.
[314:38.58]You got all this over here.
[314:39.70]Hey!
[314:42.14]Alright, I bugged it.
[315:01.77]His floor sucks way worse than mine.
[315:03.35]Why are you guys talking so much shit?
[315:04.75]Where's that guy?
[315:20.41]There you are.
[315:29.77]400 bucks, hell yeah.
[315:32.10]That was worth it.
[315:39.42]It's time for a door.
[315:41.08]Let's go.
[315:41.44]You can play Monster Hunter Rise?
[315:46.06]Nah, I don't think so.
[315:48.62]I played a shitload of Monster Hunter: World and...
[315:52.66]I finished the game.
[315:53.82]I beat the game, and I kind of did a little bit of the extra stuff and kind of kept going, but... I got my fellow monster, Monster Hunter.
[316:01.83]It was fun.
[316:09.67]What's the best iPad game?
[316:10.68]Oh, the Rune series.
[316:12.88]And if you've never played it before, let me just... You got so much to work with.
[316:17.89]They have like five games in the series and they're all so much fun.
[316:20.51]It's just like a relaxing, tinkering puzzle game.
[316:23.60]Get the room, get the whole series.
[316:27.96]That's by far the best iPad game just to play in bed for sure.
[316:33.28]Alright, door.
[316:34.82]Automatic sliding door.
[316:40.62]It's glorious looking.
[316:43.91]Finally.
[316:56.01]Nice.
[316:57.17]Why did this fall?
[317:02.67]I'll do 20... 22.
[317:07.19]What about the Outer Wilds DLC?
[317:09.15]Mmm, probably not.
[317:11.65]Why would this even light on fire?
[317:13.27]No one's even using it.
[317:18.11]Outer Wilds was fun.
[317:20.85]But, oh no, this is a disaster.
[317:24.41]Thank God I had just enough.
[317:26.15]I gotta go now and get another one.
[317:30.64]Outer Wilds was a fun game, but the problem with it was... I've heard the DLC is really... Not necessarily confusing, but very specific.
[317:41.50]And it could take a lot of time.
[317:43.25]I probably don't think I'll be into it.
[317:46.17]That game was really cool, though.
[317:47.99]I'm just not sure I'd be able to do the DLC very well.
[317:51.89]It's very cryptic, yeah.
[317:55.82]We don't do high-functioning brain games on this stream very often.
[318:01.82]I'm just so distractible.
[318:02.98]I'm so all over the place.
[318:04.84]Alright, that's another one of these.
[318:08.45]Okay.
[318:12.53]Next step is the point of sale, and then after that is the kitchen.
[318:16.55]The temperature, yeah.
[318:17.31]Good idea.
[318:21.24]Play it off stream?
[318:21.90]Yeah, I probably will.
[318:22.94]A little warm.
[318:30.99]Money?
[318:35.89]Oh, right.
[318:36.31]Ceiling.
[318:38.43]Not a bad idea.
[318:41.35]I don't have enough money for it.
[318:42.57]Alright, let's get open.
[318:43.15]Alright.
[318:45.73]Alright.
[318:49.54]Seems pretty good.
[318:51.38]Chair is... Actually, no, no, no.
[318:52.98]Chair, you're right.
[318:53.54]I need a chair.
[318:58.37]Is the room both trapped over here?
[319:03.23]You just opened at 6 p.m.?
[319:04.59]Yeah, it's a night place.
[319:05.57]It's people that can come hang out and have drinks and shit, man.

[336:57.98]This thing's not even worth anything.

[338:47.10]No, you can't.
[338:47.44]I was going to say you can't count supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
[338:50.32]That's a fake word.
[338:50.94]Alright, close up.
[339:01.13]Let's go play blackjack.
[339:02.13]And I'm going to let's see if I can get to a couple grand.

[339:49.68]Okay, I'm driving around in a circle.
[340:02.43]Where the hell?
[340:07.55]Oh, it's over here.

[340:21.00]No, okay.
[340:21.52]Alright, blackjack.
[340:25.66]Behind the bar.
[340:28.28]I didn't even see this room.
[340:32.25]Alright, here we go.
[340:35.39]Nice.
[340:38.37]Gentlemen.
[340:38.67]This is really intimidating.
[340:44.40]This is a table you don't walk up to with a bunch of crumpled up 20s.
[340:50.18]Gentlemen, how are we?
[340:51.02]10 versus 7.
[340:57.21]You're already just fucking screwing me here.
[341:00.93]17 versus 20.
[341:01.51]It's over.
[341:03.55]Alright.
[341:03.91]We're good.
[341:05.41]That's pretty good.
[341:06.85]Again.
[341:06.99]Let's do it again.
[341:09.19]Blackjack.
[341:10.09]13 versus 7.
[341:10.95]Give me a free card.
[341:12.49]There it is.
[341:12.87]See you later.
[341:15.89]100 bucks.
[341:16.13]Alright, now we get cocky.
[341:22.93]Okay.
[341:24.11]Okay.
[341:25.99]There it is.
[341:26.81]8 versus... We got 5s.
[341:33.69]We're gonna see if we can get a 10 here.
[341:36.31]That's bad.
[341:37.39]That's okay.
[341:39.97]Take it again.
[341:40.81]Very good.
[341:44.17]Let's fucking go!
[341:44.99]Come on!
[341:47.24]Oh shit, he's got blackjack under there, doesn't he?
[341:59.52]That is absolute horseshit.
[342:02.32]You all know it.
[342:03.99]Dealer gets blackjack on that hand.
[342:07.27]Not.
[342:08.11]Ever.
[342:08.81]Never.
[342:09.81]Never.
[342:10.09]And you stand on 15.
[342:11.31]You stand against a 5 like that.
[342:15.91]I'm coming back.
[342:19.04]Bingo.
[342:19.52]Done.
[342:20.68]It's alright.
[342:27.17]Blackjack.
[342:28.21]Oh, fuck you.
[342:29.73]Fuck you.
[342:30.91]Fuck all of you.
[342:31.73]Not you guys.
[342:32.47]These guys with the suits on.
[342:36.81]I got so screwed.
[342:38.56]You all know it.
[342:41.96]Just give me the safe.
[342:43.62]I got absolutely decimated.
[342:46.31]That blackjack, dealer blackjack, such bullshit.
[342:49.76]Dealers shouldn't even be allowed to get blackjack in this game.
[342:56.02]That's so dumb.
[342:57.38]Give me a break.
[342:58.64]No, I'm not done.
[342:59.38]17 versus a 20.
[343:06.00]Give me a break.
[343:16.91]I can turn this around.
[343:17.55]13 over 7.
[343:23.84]Get the free card.
[343:24.44]There it is.
[343:25.00]20.
[343:25.50]Alright.
[343:26.04]Climbing back.
[343:26.52]Let's go for a 50 here.
[343:30.18]That 9 bullshit.
[343:32.87]You're going to be 19 and it's going to be a draw.
[343:35.03]Great.
[343:36.37]Alright.
[343:36.81]Again.
[343:37.03]Do it again.
[343:40.31]16.
[343:40.35]Stay against a 5.
[343:41.29]Don't ever hit this.
[343:42.79]That's exactly why.
[343:43.71]I would have just taken that card, and I would have busted.
[343:47.29]Do you get it?
[343:47.84]100 bucks.
[343:51.68]Oh, please.
[343:53.08]Oh, my God.
[343:53.92]Oh, my God.
[343:58.92]What is this table?
[344:02.91]I think the guy's shit-faced, Dylan.
[344:04.35]Of course he is.
[344:04.81]Alright.
[344:10.48]Oh my god, I just like angrily almost just like punched you.
[344:19.49]I'll be back and I'm getting my revenge.
[344:21.99]I'm going to get my monetary revenge.
[344:23.49]Let me make that very clear to the three of you.
[344:25.97]Monetary revenge.
[344:26.79]I'm going to come back and make money.
[344:28.19]I'm not going to hurt anybody.
[344:30.40]Monetary revenge.
[344:40.38]That thousand dollar bet, that was a big, that was a big bet too.
[344:45.91]Anything other than 20, I had 18.
[344:47.07]If you had anything other than 21, of course the dealer hits blackjack on that hand.
[344:52.49]It didn't happen any other time.
[344:55.78]That sucks.
[344:56.82]That's so annoying.
[344:57.72]Oh, man.
[345:09.01]Is the Mafia City guy?
[345:10.23]Yeah.
[345:12.87]I will be back there with another 500 bucks.
[345:19.75]There's always a possibility that's why you don't go all in.
[345:22.37]Where you go all in every single time and you just win three hands and you never play ever again.
[345:31.94]Come on in.
[345:39.12]You do a $500 hand.
[345:40.98]You win $500.
[345:41.92]You do a $1,000 hand.
[345:43.52]You win $1,000.
[345:43.80]You do a $2,000 hand.
[345:44.56]You win $4,000.
[345:45.14]And then you get up and fucking leave.
[345:48.70]And then you start... Then you go to, like, those machines that you can do literally one penny for the middle line.
[345:56.36]And you just spend those for an hour and just drink booze.
[346:00.30]You just sit there for, like, four hours and do that.
[346:09.30]Alright, we're good.
[346:12.36]Don't take this advice, by the way.
[346:13.68]No, absolutely do not.
[346:18.50]In fact, don't ever gamble.
[346:21.57]Unless you just don't give a shit, right?
[346:25.17]Gambling is always a lose scenario, no matter what.
[346:30.39]Even if you win, it's always a lose scenario.
[346:34.19]Gambling is entertainment.
[346:35.99]And if it's treated like anything else...
[346:39.69]It's not going to happen.
[346:46.82]If you are comfortable and you're in a financial position to go blow $300 or $400 at a casino, okay, right?
[346:56.26]But if you go to a casino and you take $1,000 there or $100, $500, and you're like, man, I can't wait to sit down and make $2,000.
[347:04.25]Nope.
[347:05.01]Don't ever say that.
[347:07.41]You are going to lose every single time.
[347:10.51]When you walk in the door, pretend that your money just turned into Monopoly money.
[347:13.77]Because it doesn't exist anymore.
[347:15.84]You bring a certain amount of money into the casino that turns into Monopoly money.
[347:21.39]And that's it.
[347:29.91]This is why I lost $10,000.
[347:31.51]I did not lose $10,000 at a casino.
[347:36.13]Always put a limit on how much you know.
[347:37.85]Yeah, exactly.
[347:38.47]It can be fun.
[347:40.13]Just don't go overboard.
[347:40.93]As long as you know exactly what you're willing to kind of play with and just hang out with.
[347:50.13]I've had a lot of good times just kind of sitting around a blackjack table just doing, you know, playing $5,000 to $10,000 hands.
[347:56.09]You know what I mean?
[348:01.54]I've never done... I'm kidding.
[348:02.72]Fucking Jesus Christ.
[348:09.44]Please don't think that's serious.
[348:10.78]I'm actually kidding.
[348:12.94]I'm not.
[348:13.75]Please.
[348:14.11]I saw people sweating.
[348:21.65]What do you want me to do?
[348:25.47]Yeah, it's... The best practice you can do is if you're gonna spend...
[348:32.64]If you're gonna spend $100, $50... Wait, he's trapped.
[348:37.61]Why is he trapped?
[348:38.11]He's trying to go after somebody.
[348:41.45]What happened?
[348:43.05]Why is he trapped?
[348:45.76]Who did you just do that to?
[348:46.60]Did you just do that to an animal?
[348:52.06]Did a cat steal money out of the register?
[348:53.96]What was that?
[349:04.32]Also, play games that are slow, too.
[349:05.72]You don't want to... Don't play games that take a second.
[349:14.76]Roulette's fun because you can do really kind of low bets in roulette.
[349:18.51]Takes a while for it to happen.
[349:19.71]And roulette is just throwing coins in the air and, like, who cares, right?
[349:33.45]Need more of this.
[349:42.86]Blackjack is one of the best games with the least house edge.
[349:47.31]And what the house edge means is that it's a percentage, right?
[349:50.83]And it's based on for every $100 that comes into the casino, a certain percentage is guaranteed to go back to the house.
[349:57.91]Stuff like Blackjack only has, I think, like less than a 5% house edge.
[350:06.80]Slot machines have anywhere between like a 10 to 24% or so house edge, right?
[350:14.28]So that just means that it's guaranteed that for every hundred dollars or for every dollar that comes in, 24 cents is always going to be lost at the casino.
[350:23.69]Now that's over time, right?
[350:25.03]That's over a long period of time.
[350:28.53]And over a year, sure, somebody could hit a million dollar jackpot, but $4 million came into the casino, right?
[350:39.30]over the course of a day or a week or a month or something.
[350:44.70]You're always out to lose, is what I'm saying.
[350:46.42]The casino likes it when you win because that means you're going to play more.
[350:56.57]And I'll tell you, the itch hits you, especially, kick that guy in the head.
[351:01.33]The itch hits you, especially, especially when, if you go to a casino, and you're with a bunch of friends, and you're hanging out, you're having a good time, and you hit on a slot machine or something, within the first 10 seconds that you get in there, right?
[351:15.54]You walk in, oh, this is great, I guess I'll play this one.
[351:18.26]And you've been there for 10 minutes, and you hit like $150 on the machine.
[351:26.06]It's like, holy shit, this is fucking amazing.
[351:27.32]This is awesome.
[351:28.12]This is so much money, right?
[351:31.93]Are you just gonna leave?
[351:34.77]Are you- Alright, that's it, guys.
[351:36.87]Uh, we plan- We plan on having a night out for, like, at least the next four to six hours.
[351:41.03]I'm gonna go home.
[351:41.65]I'm going back to my hotel room.
[351:44.60]No.
[351:45.36]People stick around.
[351:46.54]You hang out.
[351:47.28]You stay- You're not just gonna leave.
[351:53.24]So, you just have to make sure you pace yourself.
[351:55.68]Don't go crazy.
[351:56.69]Don't spend more than you want to lose.
[351:59.35]But you're gonna play, right?
[352:02.75]As long as that's what you- Look, people go to the casino and they don't have any intention of gambling.
[352:05.67]They just watch their fucking idiot friends lose all their money.
[352:08.75]Right?
[352:10.15]You can be that guy.
[352:11.47]You can walk around with the beer in your hand or like the glass of wine or the cocktail and just be like, Oh, so hey, how you doing?
[352:18.14]Oh, you're down 80 bucks?
[352:20.20]Oh.
[352:21.48]This was 8 bucks.
[352:23.00]And I'm just going to sip it for the next hour.
[352:30.96]Back to blackjack?
[352:31.60]What do you think I'm doing?
[352:32.58]I'm building up a bankroll.
[352:35.82]I'm going to do a thousand dollars.
[352:36.84]No, I'm not.
[352:37.62]I want to.
[352:40.08]Stop shilling for the casino suits.
[352:43.53]I'm not shilling for a casino.
[352:45.19]I'm telling you how it is.
[352:52.85]Oh, the point of sale.
[352:53.85]Exactly.
[352:54.27]Good call.
[353:00.42]Alright.
[353:01.30]Now I can literally just leave.
[353:15.43]You live in Las Vegas and you're not chilling for the casinos?
[353:17.89]I mean, Vegas is awesome.
[353:19.71]I love it here.
[353:22.46]I realistically, if you want me to be transparent with you here, I realistically probably go to the casino.
[353:29.37]I mean, maybe, maybe three or four times a year.
[353:34.17]It's usually when there's an event happening, somebody's coming in, a friend, a group of friends, right?
[353:40.76]If a group of friends come in, hey, we're coming and we'll be in Vegas for three or four days.
[353:44.96]Alright, we're going to go to like the Cosmopolitan and hang out.
[353:47.74]We're going to go to the Aria.
[353:48.60]We're going to go downtown, right?
[353:55.64]I have a point of sale.
[353:56.82]What happened?
[354:02.34]What was that?
[354:02.84]Did she just not want to use it?
[354:15.32]Who keeps... What vandal keeps knocking this off?
[354:27.22]Fun place.
[354:34.12]I feel like this is a chat message.
[354:36.95]Don't you?
[354:37.25]The Squid Game person?
[354:44.13]Where?
[354:48.70]Please, please play fruit slots.
[354:50.64]I swear to God you'll make everything back and much more.
[354:53.02]Or ban me if you lose everything.
[354:54.58]Alright.
[354:56.40]We've got a challenge here.
[355:00.30]Stirben67 here is putting his neck on the line.
[355:08.64]And we're looking for a ban.
[355:11.34]Alright, Stirben.
[355:11.80]Stirben.
[355:13.90]What is your criteria?
[355:15.38]I'm going to allow this.
[355:17.29]How much money do I need to spend at what denomination?
[355:20.49]We're going to let you... You have the floor.
[355:24.47]Mods, if he gives a message, I really want to see it.
[355:33.32]Durban.
[355:34.74]I'm talking about how much money and what denomination.
[355:42.85]He said, $10 bets, 100 spins, he says.
[355:45.03]Okay.
[355:45.99]Alright.
[355:48.07]So we're putting up a ban here.
[355:49.73]A 30-day ban?
[355:52.82]I don't want to ban you for that long.
[355:54.54]How about a week?
[355:56.50]I will ban you for a week from this channel if this doesn't work.
[355:58.62]Are we all agreeing with that?
[356:00.42]It's got to be permanent?
[356:02.30]Oh, shit.
[356:06.43]That's a lot.
[356:08.97]Permanent ban?
[356:10.11]Do they agree to that?
[356:10.93]I don't know.
[356:11.29]That's, like, sad, though.
[356:14.30]I don't know if I want to do this, that's kind of sad.
[356:18.94]So I need $1,000.
[356:24.64]You just agreed to a permanent ban if this doesn't work out?
[356:31.08]They've been following since 2019.
[356:33.12]Don't make it permanent.
[356:34.14]Yeah, okay, 30 days.
[356:35.46]I don't want to do that.
[356:38.51]Yeah, that's too sad to me.
[356:39.73]30 days.
[356:42.91]That's kind of sad too.
[356:44.45]Alright, one week.
[356:48.31]No, that's too sad.
[356:50.17]One week.
[356:52.20]Alright, I'll meet you in the middle.
[356:53.98]Two weeks.
[357:03.52]You're going to get banned from the channel for two weeks if this doesn't work.
[357:10.40]He's just that confident though.
[357:14.63]Just wants to be set free from this place.
[357:24.24]Two weeks is like one stream.
[357:25.78]That's so funny.
[357:34.08]No, I've been streaming two days a week.
[357:36.51]I've upped it.
[357:37.53]I'm not just doing once a week anymore.
[357:42.08]I'm streaming twice a week now.
[357:43.60]Usually, like, Wednesday and Sunday.
[357:45.09]Wednesday and Sunday.
[357:45.95]Wednesday and Sunday.
[357:46.87]Come on.
[357:48.07]Come on, Gwen.
[357:56.32]Alright, we gotta get to a thousand bucks.
[358:00.60]This is important, though.
[358:02.64]What's the amount of money that they're expecting I'm gonna make?
[358:12.90]If they win, they need to be VIP'd.
[358:15.83]Hmm.
[358:17.69]Hmm.
[358:20.85]Hmm.
[358:24.45]Hmm.
[358:28.59]Okay.
[358:30.27]Hmm.
[358:30.95]Let me think about that.
[358:35.16]Alright, fine.
[358:35.54]You get VIP'd for two weeks.
[358:36.80]If you win.
[358:37.96]Well, what's the amount of money?
[358:38.98]We need to have it really clear.
[358:40.20]Because if I have to spin...
[358:44.09]100 times at $10, and you're certain of this.
[358:47.38]What amount, because I could just keep going, right?
[358:49.18]So what amount do I have to stop?
[358:50.82]What amount are you expecting me to hit?
[358:54.16]Like in profit from $1,000.
[358:55.50]So I start with $1,000.
[359:02.74]Where do I end up with your guarantee with 100 spins?
[359:11.12]I want to make sure we get it in chat.
[359:12.28]I can't see.
[359:16.80]10k plus, he says.
[359:19.89]That seems... Oh, thanks.
[359:26.39]They said 10k plus?
[359:31.88]That's... Alright.
[359:32.78]Are you sure?
[359:41.60]Okay.
[359:43.20]I guess if you're that confident, this is a two-week VIP or a two-week ban.
[359:49.22]We just gotta get to a thousand bucks.
[359:50.66]We're almost there.
[359:56.68]But wait.
[359:57.80]They said, but you have to increase your bet size if you make a decent enough profit.
[360:01.94]Wait.
[360:02.38]These are not the terms that we're describing here.
[360:06.67]What do you mean?
[360:09.57]I thought it was 100 spins at $10 a spin.
[360:18.26]If you get 10k, perma VIP him, seriously.
[360:26.82]Say you get to like, well, hang on, wait, wait.
[360:29.28]Say you get to like 2 or 3 to 5k, you have to increase my bet to what?
[360:37.44]There's so many terms of this contract.
[360:40.06]There's so many terms to this agreement.
[360:44.02]Okay, so if I hit, if I get to like 3k, I then have to, I can't just go, I need $1,000.
[360:51.23]Alright, so if I get to 3k, I up my bet to what?
[361:08.51]$20?
[361:08.85]$30?
[361:09.75]Make it three weeks.
[361:21.30]Did we get any more updated terms?
[361:23.06]Okay.
[361:24.36]I have to watch xQc play this.
[361:26.16]I'm playing this right now.
[361:28.08]Alright?
[361:28.46]You're here.
[361:31.74]I'm playing it right now.
[361:35.89]Criken just came in with a fucking monster raid, too.
[361:38.39]What's going on, Criken?
[361:40.85]Welcome, everybody.
[361:41.89]We're playing Internet Cafe Simulator.
[361:43.79]We're in the middle of a big, big agreement here, a big contract.
[361:48.12]It's about to be signed.
[361:48.92]We'll make sure the terms are correct.
[361:50.92]Thanks for the raid.
[361:51.42]Hope you had a good stream.
[361:52.30]Welcome, everybody.
[361:54.58]There's your raid song.
[361:55.34]Can I snap that meme's neck right now, please?
[362:02.34]No more.
[362:02.70]Stop doing that.
[362:03.60]Stop doing that to people.
[362:05.06]Everybody hates that fucking thing.
[362:07.10]Nobody likes that.
[362:08.40]Nobody thinks that's funny.
[362:10.04]Stop.
[362:10.84]No more.
[362:13.30]People probably loathe my raids because when I raid somebody, they're just like, oh, here come the fucking raid song people again.
[362:19.02]I don't even want to listen to them.
[362:23.06]Alright.
[362:23.26]Anyways, thanks for the raid.
[362:24.52]And we're ready to get started.
[362:26.32]We have terms here.
[362:28.76]Welcome to Crican viewers.
[362:29.60]Welcome to Crican.
[362:30.28]Thanks a lot.
[362:30.88]Hope you had a good day.
[362:33.02]Okay.
[362:34.76]I was told that if I spin 100 times at $10, starting with $1,000 on this slot machine, that I will be able to get to $10,000 plus.
[362:45.23]There's a person in chat here who is putting their stream chat life here.
[362:51.55]They're going to be banned from the channel if it doesn't work, or they're going to get VIP'd if it does.
[362:56.19]This is very important terms.
[363:02.01]We're just trying to iron them out.
[363:03.35]So if I, if I, if I spin, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, okay, if I hit two, three thousand dollars, he told me he was going to go leave and watch xQc's stream instead.
[363:11.99]But, if you make it to 3k, increase the bet to fifty dollars.
[363:17.37]And then, okay, you got it.
[363:19.65]Are we ready?
[363:21.31]So if I hit 3k, if I get to 3k, I'm going to do fifty dollar spins.
[363:25.84]But we're still only doing a hundred spins.
[363:28.70]No matter what, right?
[363:33.60]Here we go.
[363:34.56]It's time.
[363:38.44]Close the shop for this.
[363:39.26]Yeah, you're right.
[363:40.32]Everybody out.
[363:42.00]I want to be in darkness for this.
[363:46.80]Use the machine.
[363:47.46]Oh my god.
[363:49.04]Okay.
[363:49.46]Everybody out.
[363:51.18]Get the fuck out.
[363:53.12]Get the fuck out, Larry.
[363:54.75]Get the fuck out of here, Larry.
[363:56.53]Get the fuck out, Larry.
[364:01.60]There's no electricity anymore.
[364:02.66]You're not even playing the machines.
[364:03.64]Okay.
[364:18.17]You know.
[364:22.01]Anybody comes in or out.
[364:25.24]You roundhouse kick him like you always fucking do.
[364:27.78]Nobody in.
[364:28.86]Nobody out.
[364:30.38]Not until I say.
[364:51.55]Nobody in and nobody out!
[364:52.97]Did you- it's closed!
[364:54.47]Get the fuck out of my restaurant!
[364:56.65]Close the door!
[365:01.50]What the fuck?
[365:02.22]Oh, there's no electricity.
[365:06.26]How are you people even getting- this- this- I- did I- wait, I didn't- there's no electricity.
[365:12.38]How are you playing when there's no elec- alright, you know what, here.
[365:19.55]We're closed.
[365:20.50]Please, nobody come in.
[365:36.39]We are closed.
[365:37.57]I closed it already.
[365:38.69]This is what I'm talking about.
[365:39.85]I've already closed.
[365:42.57]Let's do it.
[365:48.85]End all the bets.
[365:51.72]You ready?
[365:52.06]Let's see what happens to Ster.
[365:55.13]Um, was her name Stirbun?
[366:00.47]One.
[366:02.61]Two.
[366:05.29]Two.
[366:10.11]Okay.
[366:16.27]Three.
[366:20.15]Oh shit!
[366:20.75]Autospin!
[366:24.56]Alright, so that was 3, so this would be 83 spins, right?
[366:35.98]What the fuck?
[366:37.22]Oh.
[366:38.60]Alright, this would be 84 spins.
[366:50.94]Okay.
[366:54.20]Whoa, shit!
[366:55.00]Whoa, what happened?
[366:58.14]What is this?
[367:00.72]5x?
[367:01.16]Wait, I got the bonus.
[367:02.16]Times two?
[367:10.56]What's the times two?
[367:11.50]How come it's not triggering anything?
[367:14.42]Um... Hello?
[367:25.85]I've won $62 in this bonus so far.
[367:32.69]Oh, they just exist.
[367:34.09]Okay, I get it.
[367:34.63]What a dogshit bonus.
[367:35.17]$10 spin, $80.
[367:36.49]What a piece of crap.
[367:37.61]Well.
[367:37.71]Okay.
[367:37.85]Okay.
[367:54.31]Oh, I... How did a cat get in here?
[368:01.65]I do have to stop this, though, if we get to 3k.
[368:09.63]Stop promoting gambling?
[368:11.19]I don't promote gambling.
[368:12.31]I think you should not gamble at all.
[368:13.69]Ever.
[368:15.81]Unless...
[368:21.67]Just rewind 20 minutes and just watch like the 30 minute rant I just had about this.
[368:31.44]I see candy.
[368:31.98]We need another piece of candy.
[368:36.88]Come on.
[368:43.30]Have you watched any GDQ?
[368:44.60]No, not yet.
[368:45.13]I probably will.
[368:49.12]Oh shit, alright, we got it.
[368:49.92]Come on.
[368:58.69]Come on.
[369:05.07]Times one?
[369:05.81]Give me more.
[369:06.31]Give me like a times a hundred.
[369:09.87]That's a 50x right there.
[369:12.50]Oh, that sucks.
[369:13.66]That's so bad.
[369:15.74]Come on.
[369:18.85]Free spins are... Well, no, free spins don't count.
[369:21.66]100x?
[369:21.80]What just happened?
[369:23.34]Holy shit.
[369:29.50]Okay, uh... Free spins don't count, because they're not actually spins.
[369:33.90]Uh-oh.
[369:37.44]Where it... What's going on?
[369:39.34]What are you doing?
[369:47.06]It actually might happen.
[369:54.88]Prove this is not pre-recorded by reading your message, PigeonMan42.
[369:58.20]Oh, I just proved it.
[370:01.04]Right now.
[370:03.88]Not actually a spin.
[370:04.62]No, it has to be 100 actual paid spins.
[370:07.86]A free spin is a free spin.
[370:09.02]It doesn't count.
[370:10.02]It's part of a bonus.
[370:10.74]The bonus is its own encompassed thing.
[370:15.95]Doesn't count.
[370:17.37]Candy.
[370:20.27]Candy.
[370:26.57]It was a plant.
[370:31.17]Oh, it's getting late too.
[370:32.47]I probably have to stop soon.
[370:33.41]Alright, there's the free spins.
[370:37.49]Looking for 100x.
[370:39.65]Or I'll take a re-triggering.
[370:49.42]Give me another 100x.
[370:52.90]It's time to raise the bet.
[370:54.12]I was not told to do that.
[370:56.79]There's 100x right there.
[370:58.35]Oh, please.
[370:59.29]Why?
[370:59.89]Watermelons.
[371:05.50]Okay.
[371:08.68]Okay.
[371:16.39]Raise the bet to 50.
[371:18.17]Yeah.
[371:18.75]No, it was raise the bet to 50 when I got to 3k.
[371:21.23]Okay.
[371:32.52]That's pretty big.
[371:33.02]How do the bombs work?
[371:46.30]I don't know.
[371:46.72]The bombs in the bonus seem to just be... I just add multiplier.
[371:53.65]Alright, come on.
[371:56.55]It's times one.
[372:02.69]He's saying to do it now.
[372:03.68]We've already locked it in, so I don't know.
[372:04.90]Wait.
[372:05.58]He's saying do it now.
[372:08.50]Do we listen to this?
[372:09.96]He's saying he wants his remaining spins here to be 50.
[372:13.92]It actually might happen right here.
[372:18.94]I got four more free spins.
[372:23.55]Times two.
[372:24.01]Come on.
[372:30.63]That's going to be huge.
[372:31.75]Times 100. 100.
[372:33.70]Alright, no, he's got it.
[372:35.36]He said 2K originally.
[372:36.74]He did.
[372:37.10]He did say 2K originally.
[372:45.28]Alright, alright, alright.
[372:45.88]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[372:47.10]Stop spinning!
[372:47.78]Stop spinning!
[372:49.18]I can't stop it!
[372:51.50]Stop auto-spinning!
[372:52.36]How do I turn it off?
[372:56.81]Okay.
[372:58.69]He said 3K, but he also... He is saying he wants it to go... He wants to change it right now.
[373:10.11]Because in his original message, he said when you get to 2, 3, or 5k, to put it to 50.
[373:20.19]Ster, Ster, Ster, uh, Ster bean or whatever.
[373:22.30]Ster, uh, are you in here?
[373:32.14]What do we got?
[373:35.10]Yes, they're here.
[373:35.82]Okay.
[373:38.22]Wait, we got a message?
[373:39.66]I needed to feel it out.
[373:40.70]You know what I'm saying?
[373:41.68]Forcing CD.
[373:42.54]I'm ready for $50 bets.
[373:43.76]Okay.
[373:45.70]Okay.
[373:51.37]Let's go.
[373:52.97]Alright, let's go.
[373:53.81]Let's go.
[373:54.47]I'm gonna adhere to this.
[373:56.83]You ready?
[373:59.91]Let's go for it.
[374:00.61]$50 spins here.
[374:21.26]He's gonna get banned.
[374:22.38]I don't know.
[374:22.90]If there's another bonus with $50 bets, it could be a big deal.
[374:27.80]We'll see.
[374:29.40]I'm gonna hold my breath for a second, though.
[374:33.21]Because you have to... Those three candies have to show up.
[374:35.35]There's two.
[374:36.33]If there's another one, this is a big deal.
[374:37.37]Uh-oh.
[374:41.87]Oh, no.
[374:42.39]Nothing.
[374:45.23]Is this the Among Us guy?
[374:46.25]No, it's my brother.
[374:46.79]We share a channel and stuff.
[374:52.55]I think he sucks though.
[374:53.17]I don't think he's that funny.
[374:54.07]We have like pretty bad like family problems together.
[374:55.74]I think he's a fucking annoying little shit.
[374:58.90]I mean, we do share the channel.
[374:59.88]We have like a contract and stuff.
[375:05.02]Come on!
[375:12.23]Yeah, me and my brother, uh, Jeremy.
[375:15.05]My name is Jerpa.
[375:21.55]Our personality is like a little different.
[375:22.57]You can always tell who's who.
[375:25.62]I'm the funny one.
[375:26.44]I'm like the one that's like, we got it.
[375:27.80]We got it.
[375:28.10]Shut up.
[375:28.66]This joke sucks.
[375:29.40]Who cares?
[375:29.68]Let's go.
[375:30.14]What a stupid idea.
[375:30.98]Come on.
[375:31.18]Let's go.
[375:33.90]This is it.
[375:34.80]This is his opportunity to make this happen.
[375:41.12]That's two.
[375:42.94]Oh, no.
[375:43.71]Right now, he's probably screaming.
[375:45.87]He wants to see it times 50 or times 100.
[375:51.25]Oh, it's going, though.
[375:53.61]Oh, no.
[375:56.69]A 10k?
[375:59.71]10,000?
[375:59.87]I don't know, man.
[376:00.81]I don't think it's gonna happen.
[376:09.62]50x.
[376:09.86]Oh.
[376:10.60]Uh-oh.
[376:18.63]Not much time left, though.
[376:27.00]Really looking for those free spins.
[376:31.68]Holy shit.
[376:34.14]Holy shit.
[376:34.92]This is still going.
[376:39.76]Oh my god.
[376:40.60]We're back on regular spins now.
[376:51.13]Don't be fooled by that counter.
[376:52.29]There's still about 20 more spins to add on top.
[377:04.26]I don't think it's going to happen.
[377:07.94]Why is the game auto-pause?
[377:15.39]It's starting to drain.
[377:19.63]Andy?
[377:20.33]No.
[377:24.64]Come on.
[377:25.06]I want him to win.
[377:28.22]I'm rooting for him.
[377:35.61]Yeah, there are 16 more spins after this.
[377:38.59]It's looking pretty grim.
[377:39.41]A lot of bombs, but not gonna do anything.
[377:58.44]Oh no!
[378:02.43]no oh no it's draining it was at 3k oh no wait a minute redemption potentially that's a bonus right now if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen right here only times two
[378:32.23]Nothing.
[378:36.34]Only 2x, though.
[378:37.30]That's not very good.
[378:40.04]You need a big one.
[378:40.70]Uh-oh.
[378:53.63]Nothing.
[378:54.47]I don't think it's going to happen, man.
[379:03.99]Nothing.
[379:11.04]Why is it still going?
[379:12.18]340.
[379:17.06]This won't stop.
[379:20.12]Oh my god.
[379:21.01]Alright, he's got 16.
[379:26.15]Come on.
[379:26.75]I want to see it happen.
[379:27.41]5x.
[379:30.12]Alright, so you got- I got- I can just count these.
[379:32.56]Cause you got 16.
[379:32.96]Fire, fire, what do you mean fire?
[379:37.02]Fire?
[379:38.60]Where?
[379:43.00]Oh my god, what?
[379:44.10]Jesus.
[380:01.46]How long is that going?
[380:02.50]I don't have my other earbud in.
[380:06.54]Alright.
[380:06.90]16 more.
[380:12.89]He says do $100 spins on these last ones.
[380:18.43]I mean, I'm willing.
[380:19.47]Alright.
[380:19.77]16 spins at $100.
[380:25.95]I'll allow it.
[380:27.63]Here we go. 1.
[380:37.42]Two.
[380:48.13]It's pretty good spins but not enough.
[380:54.42]Hold on.
[380:57.96]Three.
[381:01.62]Four.
[381:07.61]Five.
[381:11.93]Oh shit.
[381:13.69]Six.
[381:16.77]Seven.
[381:20.89]Eight.
[381:25.67]No, nine!
[381:32.53]Ten!
[381:35.58]You got six more.
[381:37.74]Eleven.
[381:40.62]Twelve.
[381:45.00]Oh, it could happen.
[381:48.08]Thirteen.
[381:51.32]Fourteen.
[381:56.78]Fifteen.
[381:57.44]This is it, man.
[382:03.14]We're down to the final spin.
[382:04.40]This is it.
[382:07.13]Sixteen.
[382:09.67]Oh no.
[382:11.83]But hold on.
[382:14.03]Hold on.
[382:16.76]I'm gonna give him five more.
[382:26.72]Mmm.
[382:32.73]Three.
[382:35.25]Four.
[382:37.92]Five.
[382:38.66]Oh my god.
[382:39.54]I'm so sorry.
[382:43.02]I'm so sorry.
[382:50.77]Too bad.
[382:51.43]Too bad.
[382:53.33]I believed.
[382:55.79]I really did.
[382:59.79]I was rooting for you.
[383:04.41]Wait, did he just get banned automatically because he called me a fucking cheater?
[383:07.54]Wait, what?
[383:08.62]No, no, different person.
[383:16.12]Alright, let's do another one.
[383:17.40]One more.
[383:20.18]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if I get it right now.
[383:25.88]Come on.
[383:26.26]Another candy.
[383:27.48]Let's see it.
[383:28.54]He's gonna be pissed if it happens.
[383:31.98]Oh, it's gonna happen.
[383:33.02]It's gonna happen.
[383:33.62]It is.
[383:34.48]Watch this shit right now.
[383:42.03]Oh my god, there's a candy right there.
[383:43.85]Oh!
[383:54.70]I thought that was gonna happen.
[384:00.06]Ah!
[384:01.46]Come on!
[384:02.22]I'm doing it for him.
[384:10.29]Alright, that's it.
[384:10.85]I'm taking the rest of the blackjack.
[384:15.46]Thanks for playing.
[384:16.72]Oh, I feel so bad.
[384:17.94]I feel so bad.
[384:20.02]It's two weeks.
[384:21.22]That's so sad.
[384:26.80]Buy the bonus for... Wait a minute.
[384:29.10]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[384:34.05]It's $10,000 to buy the bonus?
[384:36.37]Never mind.
[384:41.23]Alright, this one's for you.
[384:45.05]Sorry, you're about to get banned for two weeks.
[384:54.58]I'm- I feel really bad about it, but... Deal's a deal.
[385:00.80]What are we- okay, no, we- we- you have the floor.
[385:02.81]I- we'd like to hear your last words.
[385:06.31]What are- what are your- what are you- what's your final message?
[385:08.51]I will read it on stream.
[385:11.13]What is it?
[385:14.81]Oh, you already banned him.
[385:16.43]Alright, well unban him so he can give his last words.
[385:29.59]Revive him.
[385:32.63]He gets at least a full, like, at least few sentences.
[385:43.54]With confirmation of what they said, you can say pretty much whatever you want.
[385:53.31]What'd he say?
[385:53.61]Wait, what'd he say?
[386:00.09]I didn't catch it.
[386:00.71]I didn't see it.
[386:01.31]What was it?
[386:07.49]I didn't see what he said.
[386:12.61]They said, when next TF2 video?
[386:16.26]What?
[386:25.10]That's your final words?
[386:28.39]When, when's the next TF, alright, the next TF2 video is going to be, um, never.
[386:34.38]I'm probably never going to make a TF2 video ever again.
[386:41.20]Thanks for playing though, dude.
[386:42.06]It was fun.
[386:43.44]We'll see you again, don't worry.
[386:44.84]We will reserve your seat for you, I promise.
[386:49.88]Hey.
[386:54.72]Hey, Ster Ben. 67002.
[386:59.82]This one's for you.
[387:01.52]I'm back, motherfuckers.
[387:02.50]Deal it.
[387:20.27]Music too!
[387:21.49]It pumps me up!
[387:22.41]I was doing it for Sturban!
[387:32.44]Guys are just laughing about me every time I leave.
[387:39.82]Where was that last hand?
[387:41.16]Against a 4.
[387:42.48]Give me a 4.
[387:43.14]You've got to be kidding me.
[387:47.23]Oh, never mind.
[387:47.95]You got 21.
[387:48.23]Great.
[387:49.49]Goodbye.
[387:49.93]Thanks.
[387:50.53]It was fun.
[387:50.87]Alright, I'm done.
[387:58.54]I'll see you guys later.
[388:00.46]I'm banned too.
[388:05.48]I'll see you guys on this weekend at some point.
[388:08.42]I'm gonna make sure, yeah, I'll save the game, that's right.
[388:11.73]Probably Saturday or Sunday, I will let you know.
[388:14.07]Keep your ears to the ground for February 1st.
[388:16.67]That is the tentative day.
[388:17.81]I'm holding in a burp.
[388:22.13]February 1st is the tentative date for the big stream.
[388:25.02]It should be a really fun time.
[388:26.20]It's something I've never really talked about.
[388:30.20]So if you're speculating on what it is, it's not really anything you've heard about.
[388:34.12]I don't think I've ever really talked about it.
[388:36.66]Maybe as a joke in passing.
[388:38.50]For like one second at some point.
[388:42.42]I don't think so though.
[388:44.20]I gotta, hold on.
[388:45.18]Let me close this place.
[388:49.42]Oh no, it's closed.
[388:50.30]It already is closed.
[388:53.62]I think the next stream that I'm going to do this weekend, it's either going to be VR or I don't know.
[389:01.08]It depends on how I feel.
[389:01.92]I've been feeling kind of like shit lately.
[389:03.78]I've been really headachy and kind of sloppy.
[389:06.26]So depending on how that plays out, it's either going to be VR or I'll push VR to like middle of January.
[389:16.05]But there will be a stream this weekend.
[389:17.31]I'll see you guys soon.
[389:18.03]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[389:22.15]And let me save the game.
[389:31.25]It is the middle of January.
[389:32.29]Well, it's January 12th.
[389:35.23]Yeah, I guess it is.
[389:36.11]But, I mean, not a few days.
[389:41.93]The plan is so I can do VR before the big stream.
[389:47.82]Because the big stream is... Well, you know what I mean.
[389:52.90]I don't have to tell you anything, right?
[389:57.42]Give us a hint?
[389:58.06]Nope.
[390:00.70]No hints.
[390:02.14]Zero.
[390:11.06]Hint or riot?
[390:11.86]You want a hint?
[390:14.99]Hmm.
[390:19.05]No.
[390:20.03]Nope.
[390:23.17]I don't think so.
[390:25.71]If I want to give you a hint, it'll be way closer to the event.
[390:29.34]That might be more fun.
[390:31.14]But not two or three weeks out.
[390:33.28]Maybe on the stream before it happens.
[390:38.88]So, thanks everybody for watching.
[390:39.90]We'll see you soon.
[390:41.98]Appreciate it.
[390:42.48]A lot of people here tonight.
[390:45.18]I know it's late.
[390:48.22]I really appreciate it.
[390:49.32]Thanks for the raids.
[390:49.92]There was a couple raids that came in.
[390:50.94]If you're still here from those raids, thanks for watching.
[390:54.45]Maybe we'll see you again.
[390:59.03]Have a beautiful evening.
[390:59.93]Well, we still have a few more minutes.
[391:06.59]Dermatv.
[391:13.63]Dermatv really is kind of... I think that's probably still the least used emote, I think.
[391:26.34]Give us a fake hint.
[391:27.10]I could give you, you know what?
[391:28.02]I could give you three hints, right?
[391:31.87]And two of them aren't real.
[391:33.31]We could play that game, maybe.
[391:38.23]That might be fun.
[391:45.67]I don't know.
[391:46.37]It depends on how much I want to reveal.
[391:53.94]Thanks for staying up.
[391:57.26]This is a fun game.
[391:58.06]I'm not sure I'll return to it.
[392:00.48]Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
[392:02.56]It was a blast, though.
[392:08.65]Yeah, aren't they doing this new thing with, um... What was the thing I saw about the moments thing?
[392:16.25]Where you get a special badge if you're at a certain event or something, or at a certain stream?
[392:22.85]I feel like that's an awesome thing to have.
[392:26.46]I would have loved to have made that for something like Dollhouse or something.
[392:33.47]At least for like the big event ones.
[392:34.55]If you don't know, Twitch is sort of doing like a little test on adding badges, a different badge that you can kind of put instead of the other ones that are for specific streams that you were at if the streamer decided to make a special badge for it.
[392:49.45]That seems kind of interesting.
[392:54.70]I think that's way more, I think that's cooler than just simply having like a, this is how many bits I've given or how many subs I've given.
[393:00.63]It's like, oh no, I was like at this stream and it was like fun, right?
[393:03.07]I think that's cool.
[393:14.71]Wish your friend a happy birthday.
[393:16.99]Uh, Jaden, I wish your friend a happy birthday.
[393:20.51]Whenever it is.
[393:24.32]They can also be applied retroactively, like you could do 2021's worst stream and best stream.
[393:28.46]Really?
[393:28.76]That's cool.
[393:33.05]Alright, I'm into that.
[393:35.81]Imagine representing as a badge the Smite stream from last year.
[393:49.56]Well, I was there.
[393:50.40]Worst dream.
[393:51.36]Like, yeah, 2013 or something.
[393:53.96]That's funny.
[393:55.56]Like little t-shirts.
[393:56.38]Alright, guys.
[393:59.91]I'll see you this weekend.
[394:00.97]Have a great night.
[394:01.55]Let me drink some more water.
[394:06.03]I'm thirsty.
[394:08.49]Good night.
[394:09.15]Take care.
[394:09.51]Have a great week.
[394:29.68]you
[395:04.54]Thank you.
