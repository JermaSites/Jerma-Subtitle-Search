[00:01.38]Let me tell you something about Origin, okay?
[00:03.57]Here comes a five minute Origin rage.
[00:09.23]That guy right now just wrote that and was just like, I fucking knew it!
[00:14.67]And it was a joke, I'm good to go.
[00:16.49]How you guys doing?
[00:23.82]If it's your first time on the stream, my name's Jeremy.
[00:28.79]Your name is Dan.
[00:30.69]One of you's name is Dan.
[00:33.46]Hope you're doing good.
[00:38.28]No, no rage tonight.
[00:40.32]Not tonight.
[00:40.76]I'm gonna do Minecraft VR.
[00:47.22]Not... Not today.
[00:49.98]On the next VR stream, I'm gonna do Minecraft VR.
[01:01.57]Am I drinking?
[01:02.33]I am not drinking.
[01:04.20]No.
[01:06.98]Not tonight.
[01:10.16]Not gonna drink tonight, no.
[01:11.42]Because I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
[01:15.97]So I'm not gonna drink a bunch of booze and then go to a doctor's appointment the next day.
[01:30.36]So, uh, that means there's no stream tomorrow.
[01:34.60]Because that appointment is right in the middle of the kind of evening afternoon.
[01:48.58]Boomer health.
[01:53.78]Have I heard that Sims 4 has first-person mode?
[01:56.56]Yes, it is kind of the reason why I'm doing this stream.
[02:01.09]I have a shitload of mods.
[02:01.99]If you remember, if you were here... If you were part of the channel about a year ago... We did Sims 4 with a bunch of dog shit going on.
[02:16.30]I don't know what the word dog shit is with me lately.
[02:18.98]It's like the fourth or fifth time I've said it.
[02:22.40]Oh, dog shit.
[02:23.18]You know, I've got lots of dog shit.
[02:27.02]I need to extend the vocabulary today.
[02:31.12]That was in November.
[02:32.53]December, January, February, March, April... Alright, so it's been like four or five months.
[02:39.25]No, it's been longer than that.
[02:43.02]No, no, that's been... It's been longer than that.
[02:45.32]I wasn't in Vegas during that stream.
[02:47.12]Yeah, that was like June of last year.
[02:52.34]I was not in Vegas during The Sims 4 stream.
[03:02.16]Oh, yeah, no, that was a long time ago.
[03:12.82]It's been just about seven months.
[03:15.06]Has it really been that long?
[03:20.12]I can't believe, like, thinking about it out loud, it's like, oh, yeah, it's been like just under a year.
[03:24.39]It's been like seven months.
[03:27.19]It's like, man, I feel like that was like two months ago.
[03:30.59]And then again, I think about it.
[03:31.45]I've lived in Vegas now for almost five months.
[03:36.04]It's like, didn't I just get here?
[03:37.22]I just got here.
[03:44.16]Strange.
[03:45.20]But anyways, a lot of you probably weren't here during those streams.
[03:49.38]And what this stream is going to be is a continuation of that.
[03:54.18]Mods.
[03:55.04]Lots of them.
[03:57.44]Sims killing each other, Sims doing drugs, animals doing drugs.
[04:02.50]I got a bunch more too.
[04:04.37]There's at least two or three other mods you have not seen yet, and first person.
[04:09.03]Figured we would give it a try.
[04:13.49]No sex mods, I'm not doing that.
[04:16.17]I cannot do that.
[04:18.45]Did you get more?
[04:19.03]I did get more.
[04:23.81]No, sex mods would get me actually in trouble with the platform.
[04:36.43]Am I ever gonna do a normal Sims game?
[04:38.30]No.
[04:39.20]I can't after this.
[04:41.98]After, like, watching Sims get chewed up by chainsaws, I can't go back and play The Sims.
[04:50.60]We tried to do that, you remember?
[04:52.24]And I'm gonna put a rule on this stream too.
[04:56.66]Because once you climb over that hill, you just start to fall down.
[05:00.47]You hit the peak and you just start tumbling.
[05:03.87]The first person that gets a knife in their back is the catalyst to the snowball.
[05:09.39]So we gotta be prepared for it.
[05:17.68]Anyways, are you ready to make the new family?
[05:29.36]Because we're not doing... Old family gone.
[05:32.24]New family coming in.
[05:36.04]The Elbertsons 2.
[05:37.22]We need a better name than that.
[05:38.29]Let's go ahead and turn this off here.
[05:43.81]Yeah, I don't know how important any of this shit is.
[05:54.27]There's a weird thing about The Sims 4, right?
[05:57.85]Does this have the most DLC out of any video game ever made?
[06:00.95]It really might.
[06:05.01]I don't even have this.
[06:06.71]Get Famous!
[06:10.98]I don't have the Get Famous collection.
[06:14.14]Look at all this though.
[06:14.86]Game packs.
[06:16.76]Stuff packs.
[06:19.02]I don't even want any of it.
[06:20.18]It doesn't have all the DLC.
[06:24.34]It's just like 600 bucks for all this shit.
[06:28.11]Each one of these is like $19.99.
[06:29.03]You want me to spend $12,000 on The Sims 4?
[06:41.94]Train Simulator has more DLC.
[06:44.66]Yeah, it does.
[06:51.13]EA Omega Lull.
[06:55.37]I got BTTV.
[06:56.77]Buy the Vampire Pack?
[06:57.87]The Vampire Pack is not... Okay, listen.
[07:01.47]Ooh, The Sims.
[07:02.51]Strangerville.
[07:03.31]Start your investigation and solve the mystery of a desert town that holds a dark, deep, dark secret.
[07:10.15]Guys, chainsaws can go through people's heads in our mod we have right now.
[07:15.98]Do you really give a shit about this?
[07:19.08]Ooh, The Sims.
[07:19.96]Jungle adventure.
[07:21.16]Take your Sims on a mysterious adventure into the wild.
[07:23.81]Discover new things, new cultures.
[07:25.85]A guy can do acid and, like, pee on his floor.
[07:32.19]This is all small potatoes to what we're doing here.
[07:40.92]New family time.
[07:43.43]Are you ready?
[07:50.66]I'm not gonna buy the DLC!
[07:52.30]Alright, so, you're probably looking at, you've got, look, you see Brazoom playing Bill.
[07:59.16]That's because I had to make sure the mods worked.
[08:01.57]So I had to just make a person.
[08:04.45]Don't worry, we're gonna revict him.
[08:08.93]You didn't see that, okay?
[08:10.39]You didn't see that.
[08:19.65]I just needed to make sure that they worked.
[08:22.57]Alright.
[08:23.57]I don't want to live here, by the way.
[08:25.75]What did we do last time?
[08:27.15]I want to try a different place.
[08:30.41]Because we got Willow Creek, Oasis Springs.
[08:33.82]Does anyone remember where we lived?
[08:38.02]I think we lived in Newcrest or something.
[08:45.00]Go into the city.
[08:45.60]Newcrest.
[08:47.12]Newcrest.
[08:50.83]I think we did, oh yeah, we did the desert last time.
[08:52.99]Let's do Newcrest.
[08:55.23]Newcrest.
[08:57.67]Or the Night City, this one?
[09:03.45]Boring.
[09:04.35]Boring.
[09:06.69]This one.
[09:09.61]Yeah, but is it always nighttime here?
[09:11.45]I don't like that.
[09:15.04]You want it to be always nighttime?
[09:21.41]Look, it's fucking always nighttime!
[09:22.87]Oh, cool.
[09:26.07]There's like a gym here?
[09:29.41]Planet Honey Pop.
[09:32.00]Karaoke bar.
[09:37.10]Okay.
[09:40.10]Uh... What the f- That's- Why the- Okay, I'm freaking out right now.
[09:47.74]Alright, anyways.
[09:49.12]Where the hell am I supposed to live?
[09:52.23]You want me to live in, like, one of these fucking apartments?
[09:57.63]I have- I'm gonna have a huge family.
[09:59.19]There's gonna be a bunch of, like, dogs, cats, aliens.
[10:01.99]You want me to live in one of these, like... New York City high-rises?
[10:06.24]Uh, Superior Cream just came in.
[10:09.78]50 bucks from Superior Cream.
[10:13.58]Thank you so much, Superior Cream.
[10:15.12]5-0. 50.
[10:21.89]And... They say, I'm Michael.
[10:24.55]It's my birthday today.
[10:25.41]Cake and ice cream is on its way.
[10:26.65]Thought I'd share some birthday cheer for all the best content.
[10:30.12]Thank you so much.
[10:32.26]Happy birthday.
[10:33.24]You shouldn't be giving me money on your birthday.
[10:38.80]But thanks a lot.
[10:40.20]Means a fucking shitload.
[10:42.10]Hope you have a fantastic birthday.
[10:44.39]Thanks for joining us for your birthday.
[10:45.95]Where are we going?
[10:46.73]Uh, map.
[10:51.99]Can I live in the art studio?
[10:54.13]Studio apartments?
[10:57.19]House apartments?
[11:01.03]What about this one?
[11:02.98]I don't want to live in the city.
[11:10.76]Art family.
[11:13.56]Not fine.
[11:14.18]Alright, this is going to be the ship family.
[11:19.50]Let us click.
[11:22.34]Okay, alright, fine.
[11:24.02]Fine, you guys get to pick where I live.
[11:26.56]I have to be able to afford it, though.
[11:28.76]No, I don't have any money.
[11:29.62]Are these places expensive?
[11:33.52]They are.
[11:33.84]I think these places are actually really expensive.
[11:40.27]Just cheat and add money?
[11:43.77]I could do that.
[11:44.61]It's Ctrl-Shift-C, right?
[11:46.13]I need to use it for one of the mods I have anyways.
[11:50.13]Alright, here you go.
[11:52.03]Where am I living?
[12:03.21]Wow, very divided.
[12:06.27]Exceptionally divided, it seems.
[12:07.89]I can't live in the park.
[12:18.74]I can't live here.
[12:19.56]I don't know why you're clicking it.
[12:30.27]Can I live in here?
[12:36.19]This is the one it seems.
[12:37.27]Okay, all two apartments.
[12:48.52]Oh, wait.
[12:48.92]Hold on, hold on.
[12:50.68]Let's do this actually democratically.
[12:52.34]Hold on.
[12:57.79]You ready?
[13:00.09]Go for it.
[13:05.75]I want the true democratic experience.
[13:14.74]It doesn't matter.
[13:15.24]Everybody wants me to live in the night town.
[13:24.64]I'm not buying this.
[13:26.66]I'm not going to buy these.
[13:28.90]No.
[13:29.30]No, I refuse.
[13:29.90]100%.
[13:29.94]I'm going here.
[13:32.74]Ready?
[13:34.92]Now pick the place.
[13:36.82]3, 2, 1.
[13:37.08]Go for it.
[13:38.86]This is the only choice that you guys are going to get the whole stream, so make it count.
[13:51.67]I'm going to cheat and give myself money.
[13:52.81]I don't know what the cheat is to do that, though.
[14:02.34]Why does everybody want me to live here?
[14:07.38]Mother load, okay.
[14:18.62]Did I do it?
[14:18.92]Did that work?
[14:28.84]I have to have a family first, okay.
[14:30.54]Alright, so this is where we're going.
[14:31.64]We're going to go to this, uh, Alto Apartments.
[14:33.87]Thank you for voting.
[14:36.05]Let's go make the family.
[14:37.19]Welcome to the next, probably, at least, hour of the stream.
[14:44.81]And everyone that has, you're, there you go, you're about to see why.
[14:48.21]Kind of don't want to change anything.
[14:56.12]More like three hours.
[15:08.68]okay um I gotta get the cheap thing off forehead uh it made it perfect I don't know what I even want to do here alright let's first of all let's get out of this
[15:37.08]Let's do some detail work on the head.
[15:38.42]Always start on the head.
[15:40.58]It looks like Daisy Duck.
[15:44.88]Well, let's go ahead and make Daisy Duck.
[15:54.76]Daisy Duck?
[15:56.66]Like Donald Duck's girlfriend?
[15:58.57]Donald Duck's, like, fiancé?
[16:00.91]Is that who Daisy Duck is?
[16:09.01]How does this look like Daisy Duck?
[16:16.97]Alright, let's keep this, let's go, let's get, I wanna do some detail here.
[16:23.64]Bring the lips down.
[16:28.00]Okay.
[16:30.16]Let's go with a bit more fat on the outside.
[16:39.51]No.
[16:39.95]Forehead being down looks fine.
[16:46.91]Now bring this in.
[16:53.41]Should we see the eyes?
[16:54.40]I don't think so.
[16:55.06]Alright, now all the way down.
[17:11.17]Maybe a little bit skinnier.
[17:21.90]Hmm, I liked it the way it was.
[17:27.88]No, no, no.
[17:28.32]We can't make another Chuck Schnauzwell.
[17:36.00]That's good.
[17:40.40]I like that.
[17:44.93]Put the nose right at the top of the mouth.
[17:48.67]Now that actually looks like a duck.
[17:49.85]Why don't I just make the duck?
[17:52.17]Right?
[18:00.55]That works, right?
[18:03.75]Alright, let's back it up a little bit.
[18:07.15]That actually scared the shit out of me.
[18:10.31]I jumped a little bit backwards.
[18:11.33]I want to grab the chi- I gotta get rid of the hair.
[18:19.03]Oops.
[18:23.26]No, no, the head's way too big.
[18:24.64]There we go.
[18:26.40]Uh, hair.
[18:27.06]Hair, you gotta go.
[18:29.12]Let's get something different here.
[18:38.67]I like this one.
[18:54.21]Not bad.
[18:55.01]I don't hate it.
[18:59.70]Nah, I don't want the nose.
[19:00.98]The nose doesn't do it for me right now.
[19:15.26]No, pull it back.
[19:15.90]Uh-oh.
[19:18.12]I think I've ruined it forever.
[19:19.00]There we go.
[19:23.69]Okay.
[19:28.91]Yeah, I prefer... The nose makes it just too weird.
[19:44.76]That looks better.
[19:45.30]Okay.
[19:49.51]The hair, though, needs to be changed.
[19:55.19]I don't hate this.
[19:58.53]That looks fine.
[20:01.50]Hold on, wait.
[20:03.04]What about just, like, the Marge Simpson?
[20:06.54]It's not the Marge Simpson, but...
[20:12.89]The forehead needs to be bigger.
[20:15.51]I'm not sure I can even make the forehead bigger.
[20:22.62]Oh shit!
[20:28.18]Fixed.
[20:30.08]Don't worry, fixed.
[20:38.53]No, I can't make the forehead any bigger.
[20:41.51]That's what you got.
[20:47.53]Is it a head shape?
[20:48.65]No, no, no.
[20:50.19]We'll keep that hair.
[20:52.07]No accessories.
[20:53.75]Oh, it's makeup.
[20:54.43]Okay.
[20:55.03]No hats.
[20:58.63]Makeup.
[21:01.97]Should we just have big eyes up here?
[21:04.12]Can I paint that myself?
[21:12.48]Holy.
[21:12.62]Holy shit.
[21:13.38]That's terrifying.
[21:22.90]Is there a way I can do this myself?
[21:26.04]Eyes, cheeks, face, paint.
[21:28.28]Can I not just do it?
[21:31.47]I made Dory from Finding Nemo.
[21:39.67]Okay.
[21:40.13]Let's mess around here.
[21:41.37]Wrench at the bottom.
[21:43.75]At the bottom.
[21:50.02]At the bottom, like here.
[21:52.42]What the fuck is that?
[21:54.68]I don't know what that is.
[21:55.40]I don't know what that is.
[21:56.98]Uh... That?
[22:07.75]Chest burster.
[22:13.33]Holy shit.
[22:15.26]Why is that under face paint?
[22:24.55]Alright, whatever.
[22:25.12]That's fine.
[22:29.90]Now let's go back to here.
[22:32.00]Change some stuff around here.
[22:33.08]Should we just give her a little, like, goat feet?
[22:48.45]That looks fine.
[22:52.55]uh let's bring those shoulders in extend the arms out a little bit need to have like alright what about oh Christ okay hold on
[23:21.28]Big, like, thick neck.
[23:25.92]The pear.
[23:26.66]Alright, we made the pear.
[23:28.14]Ooh.
[23:38.41]Okay.
[23:39.51]And then let's have... That's, that's, alright.
[23:50.05]No, it needs to be... I gotta get the right color here.
[23:54.88]Is it just a onesie that you can put on?
[23:58.20]No, no, that's not gonna work.
[24:03.26]Can I just... Can I just put her in a big, pears hair-colored onesie?
[24:09.37]I don't know what that is and I'm afraid to click it.
[24:12.35]I don't know what this is.
[24:13.93]I'm terrified.
[24:16.53]Oh.
[24:17.36]It just makes them invisible.
[24:25.71]But what would that be for?
[24:27.93]Just a floating person?
[24:30.01]A ghost lady?
[24:30.93]I don't know.
[24:34.60]What is this?
[24:36.80]Oh, just a dress.
[24:39.66]That's not bad.
[24:40.76]That's kind of a pretty good pair.
[24:47.16]I like this one.
[24:53.56]There we go.
[24:57.22]Yeah, like Pauline Pear.
[25:00.59]No, no, we need a last name here.
[25:10.03]The Pear family?
[25:11.63]No, this is not going to be the Pear family.
[25:14.76]That means every single person that has to have their last name be Pear.
[25:19.96]Do you want me to make a series of fruits?
[25:24.20]The fruit family?
[25:25.32]You just want them to be all like bananas and apples and oranges and shit?
[25:37.71]Is this worth three hours?
[25:56.74]Can I make, um... Okay.
[26:03.90]Is there... Alright, so this we got... Is this a green apple?
[26:08.35]Is this a blueberry?
[26:16.13]Can I do custom color?
[26:25.59]I hate this.
[26:26.23]I don't want to continue doing this.
[26:31.09]Because we're gonna have, like, an apple, we're gonna have a blueberry, we're gonna have a banana.
[26:36.94]Is there, like... Alright, fine.
[26:43.10]This lipstick's gotta go, though.
[26:46.52]Okay, we have to have more than one family.
[26:48.46]You guys understand that, right?
[26:51.59]Because this is gonna be a drug dealer.
[26:53.43]This is gonna be animals.
[26:56.82]We're going all out tonight.
[27:00.74]Make a vegetable family.
[27:02.06]No.
[27:07.43]Make the whole city food.
[27:12.87]How am I gonna do that?
[27:16.49]It's just fruits, vegetables, meats, and cheeses?
[27:19.99]Take the food land?
[27:26.94]No, that's gonna take me, like, all day.
[27:33.58]I actually kind of like the idea of the food group family, where it's like a... Well, we already had bread.
[27:38.74]Fats, oils, meats, cheeses, vegetables, fruits.
[27:44.82]Let's see how far I can take this, and then I'm gonna move on.
[27:48.72]Welcome to the rest of the stream.

[31:00.40]Benedict.

[31:08.62]And make it a cucumber.
[31:09.64]What?
[31:19.12]No, just have it be Doctor Strange.
[31:23.68]Benedict Cucumber Patch.
[31:30.71]Just make him green.
[31:32.27]No, no, no, no, no.
[31:33.27]Alright, we gotta focus.
[31:34.15]Focus on the banana.
[31:35.14]Benedict Banana.
[31:38.16]Fuck this already.
[31:38.96]How am I gonna do this?
[32:02.13]How am I going to make Benedict Banana?
[32:06.15]Is it looking costumes?
[32:07.31]Is there actually like a banana costume?
[32:10.69]Let's see.
[32:11.27]Suit jackets, business swimsuit, vests.
[32:15.27]Full body.
[32:17.27]Costumes.
[32:17.89]Uh-huh.
[32:20.70]Banana.
[32:30.42]Roll voice team.
[32:53.78]First person to die, by the way.
[32:57.84]No, this should be the drug dealer.
[32:58.82]No, alright, focus, focus, focus, focus, focus, focus.
[33:12.55]Okay.
[33:14.81]Take this costume off.
[33:18.55]No banana, though, unfortunately.
[33:19.93]But there is a hot dog.
[33:20.73]But what if I make the hot dog?
[33:21.84]Can I color the hot dog?
[33:26.90]Can we just pretend this is a banana?
[33:31.40]I can't make this a different color.
[33:37.19]It's a banana.
[33:38.41]Yes.
[33:38.71]Okay, guys.
[33:39.17]This is a peeled banana in a bun.
[33:53.32]With mustard on it.
[33:54.18]No, that's just banana puree.
[34:01.40]Okay, can I do anything else with that?
[34:09.43]Okay, let's see if I can make this work for all of us.
[34:20.23]Let's go in closer here.
[34:21.35]Let's bring it out.
[34:37.27]Bring the face in.
[34:51.89]Okay, really, it's hard to do this with the... I need to get in there.
[35:14.02]It's hard to get in there, though, because its head is in such a strange place.
[35:24.60]I wish I could move the camera more with the detail edit, because see how it's too big?
[35:42.65]Pull that in.
[35:47.60]Angel fish.
[35:48.72]There we go.
[35:49.14]That's a good start.
[36:05.78]Pull these ears back.
[36:08.47]I really need to get a hold of here.
[36:10.81]I can't.
[36:12.77]I gotta make his head temporarily smaller.
[36:25.02]Damn it.
[36:26.66]You really don't want to let me grab that, do you?
[36:39.39]I need to bring these out further.
[36:46.65]Oh, shit.
[36:47.83]There we go.
[37:02.48]I need the back of this head.
[37:07.42]Come on, give me the back of the head.
[37:11.68]We gotta kill all the eyebrows and shit.
[37:14.39]No facial hair.
[37:16.53]Get rid of the eyebrows too.
[37:26.17]It's Lex Luthor.
[37:28.09]Not quite.
[37:40.11]I need this to come up.
[37:45.39]I need to get under here and like pull that up.
[37:47.39]It's too long.
[37:49.93]See, I can't even grab it.
[38:02.26]Jesus Christ, this is horrifying.
[38:11.14]Okay.
[38:17.80]I need to get these eyebrows out of here.
[38:19.40]Okay.
[38:35.01]Hair.
[38:35.55]Facial hair.
[38:36.67]Accessories.
[38:37.35]Eyebrows.
[38:38.11]Delete eyebrows.
[38:46.26]Okay, there we go.
[38:52.77]I can't get rid of them?
[38:53.77]Yeah, yeah, I can.
[38:54.53]This sucks.
[39:05.52]This sucks absolute ass.
[39:09.61]Put them back?
[39:10.43]No, they're not going to put them back.
[39:12.31]I need this skull to come up.
[39:21.97]Alright, let's widen it a little more.
[39:25.30]He's ripping through the costume with his banana face.
[39:27.32]Alright, let's see if I can pull this middle back one more time.
[39:34.98]Okay, I can.
[39:43.79]There we go.
[39:52.60]That's good.
[39:55.62]I'm looking, I need that oil on this side.
[39:59.18]How do I get that little tilt there?
[40:09.65]Come on, give me that tilt.
[40:11.31]Right here.
[40:11.59]Let me see his mouth.
[40:24.85]No, that's too fucked up.
[40:26.15]We can't go totally fucked up.
[40:29.33]He has to at least kind of look like a person.
[40:36.58]That's pretty banana-like, it is.
[40:38.58]Alright, alright, now we need a hat.
[40:45.09]The nose is a little too extreme.
[40:47.19]I agree.
[40:55.39]Notice the pointy hat?
[41:02.27]Let's see, let's see if we can get any, like, goofy, funny hats?
[41:08.39]Kind of, but I can't... No, that doesn't work.
[41:16.60]That doesn't work.
[41:21.92]This is not even gonna fit on his face.
[41:23.60]Yes, it does.
[41:28.22]Yeah, why can't you have Darth Vader?
[41:33.08]Please be yellow.
[41:34.14]Oh, come on.
[41:36.66]That is as good as it's going to get.
[41:41.11]That is a banana in a bun with some hot dogs.
[41:46.37]That was perfect.
[42:02.80]It's not a hot dog.
[42:03.88]It's a banana.
[42:04.56]It's a peeled banana.
[42:06.60]You gotta go with what you can work with here.
[42:09.17]I can't make a banana.
[42:13.03]It's not a tofu dog.
[42:14.55]It's a banana.
[42:19.13]Hold on.
[42:21.29]Can I give him a jacket or something so I can cover this up?
[42:29.13]no no no I it has to be this tops can I throw something else on top no god damn it yellow tux no but it doesn't work I can't do a yellow tux
[43:01.17]It kind of does work.
[43:02.93]Wait, wait, wait.
[43:15.92]He looks like a mustard dispenser.
[43:18.37]Hold on.
[43:22.11]He's just a regular guy in a suit.
[43:24.75]But just happens to also be a banana.
[43:28.35]That's not bad.
[43:39.63]Just do a filter for yellow.
[43:43.73]Now let's get- oh, let me get- let me get out of full body.
[43:55.87]I actually kind of liked- oh, look at this one.
[44:01.19]I like the idea of he's just a regular guy.
[44:04.47]But, really, really, really took on that banana persona.
[44:10.03]And it's just killing it.
[44:16.43]Plus, make sure when we pick stuff that they're wearing that it's easy enough for me to replicate when these assholes inevitably end up in the next rumble.
[44:30.06]Oh, hold on.
[44:33.95]That's too yellow.
[44:34.79]That is mustard.
[44:35.57]This is banana.
[44:43.31]Let's see.
[44:43.55]What if we get the bottoms?
[44:50.67]Oh, no.
[44:51.23]You're right.
[44:53.49]You're right.
[44:54.99]We gotta make some very, very minor changes here because this is just like dickhead man.
[45:05.27]This is just penis guy.
[45:06.51]This is not even a banana.
[45:07.46]I gotta fix this.
[45:11.11]A banana just is a dick.
[45:13.41]If you think about it.
[45:16.69]How do I fix this?
[45:23.60]I'm talking like I'm gonna create a character.
[45:25.14]I'm making a peeled banana.
[45:29.92]And it's this... a peeled banana is this kind of like fleshy color.
[45:46.36]Just make it yellow.
[45:49.25]I can't.
[45:53.51]Alright, he's just going in regular clothes.
[45:59.37]Take off the hot dog head.
[46:00.79]That makes it so much better.
[46:02.73]Because he is a banana.
[46:07.12]He's just a guy with a big chin here.
[46:09.56]No, that has to stay.
[46:19.25]Alright, let's go.
[46:20.63]Time to complete this guy.
[46:22.74]I'm going to put him in... What was that suit I had before?
[46:28.94]No, no.
[46:38.93]He's unfriendly and scary.
[46:41.09]How do you know that?
[46:51.08]Just make him a real person.
[46:55.55]What is that?
[46:57.09]What?
[47:00.89]Oh.
[47:07.37]There it is.
[47:07.78]Why did his chin get smaller?
[47:22.76]Excuse me!
[47:23.24]What happened to him?
[47:28.49]He lost all of his charm!
[47:33.47]Look at his eyes!
[47:42.96]That's actually pretty good, because it's not as extreme.
[47:45.24]I don't hate this.
[47:58.81]The outfit fucked it up.
[47:59.69]Alright, looks good.
[48:04.22]This is Benedict Banana.
[48:05.08]Gonna change the bottom here.
[48:18.34]No, he's not gonna be jacked.
[48:19.36]He's gonna be skinny.
[48:23.95]Hot dog hat and the yellow raincoat.
[48:25.83]Should I just take the hot dog hat off?
[48:27.73]Is it technically still on?
[48:28.73]Yeah, it's technically still on.
[48:34.92]Nah, it doesn't change anything.
[48:49.92]He's perfect.
[48:51.10]He's perfect!
[48:53.71]Alright, we need to... 100% perfect.
[49:12.83]That's the banana.
[49:13.73]Peel.
[49:14.29]He's peeled back.
[49:18.69]Alright, let's see what I'm going to do for pants here.
[49:23.50]Whoa, hey, hey, hey!
[49:26.86]What?
[49:27.10]Oh, because this is full body.
[49:34.22]We can't change the pants.
[49:37.84]Oh, what the fuck?
[49:38.48]What happened to that?
[49:42.54]That's kind of dumb.
[49:51.23]Well, that's the way it's gonna be.
[49:53.07]There's been a banana for you.
[49:56.35]And this is, uh, every day.
[50:00.71]Yellow rain... Do the shoes do yellow rain boots?
[50:11.92]I don't even know if they have that shit.
[50:13.64]Boots?
[50:14.08]Here.
[50:23.54]So what's going on here then?
[50:24.58]Alright, that looks good.
[50:31.80]Benedict Banana.
[50:33.62]Bananas, uh, potassium, right?
[50:42.93]Uh, chef.
[50:47.63]Genius, it's a brain power food.
[50:52.61]No, it's got plenty of vitamins in it.
[50:55.35]Cheerful.
[50:56.83]I would say childish as well.
[51:01.76]Lots of kids eat bananas.
[51:09.58]It's in every lunchbox in America.
[51:12.98]Clumsy?
[51:13.44]Why would a banana be clumsy?
[51:16.90]Clumsy.
[51:21.52]How would a banana be clumsy?
[51:23.58]Alright, got Benedict Banana.
[51:25.74]I gotta change... Okay, so you're dumb.
[51:28.92]I gotta change your name to Pauline Pear.
[51:32.79]And not have it be the... There, Pauline Pear.
[51:37.77]Oh, it's because it was a banana.
[51:40.59]I get it.
[51:43.43]Pauline Pear.
[51:45.61]Alright, we're gonna make... Let's make Apple...
[51:52.79]Apple Andy.
[51:54.25]How's that sound?
[52:02.70]Apple Andy.
[52:06.28]Alright, let's see.
[52:08.86]How am I gonna do Apple?
[52:15.45]Adam Apple.
[52:16.35]And just have him have a huge neck, like a big fucking bump on his front of his neck.
[52:21.73]Let me see if I can do that first, and then we'll go from there.
[52:26.91]I don't think I can do that.
[52:33.34]Alright, we need to get the first things first.
[52:45.51]You should add a baby.
[52:46.97]So you can have like a baby camera.
[52:48.69]No.
[52:49.95]No, I'm not going to add a baby.
[52:51.85]Considering the in-fucking-sane mods that are in this game.
[52:56.53]Uh-uh.
[52:57.75]That's not gonna happen.
[52:58.97]That would be the worst mistake I probably could ever make.
[53:02.07]I'm telling you right now.
[53:03.49]Trust me when I say.
[53:05.09]No baby.
[53:07.11]No.
[53:08.97]No, no, no.
[53:14.44]Okay.
[53:16.46]Boo!
[53:17.04]Alright, we gotta have a huge head.
[53:20.62]There's an apple.
[53:25.84]That might be too big.
[53:29.12]Get rid of the hair.
[53:35.28]Let's go with no eyebrows.
[53:36.76]None of them should have eyebrows.
[53:37.82]Fuck the eyebrows.
[53:39.24]They have fruits.
[53:39.86]Alright, what does an apple look like?
[53:46.08]It's a square, right?
[53:51.86]I mean it's... First of all... No, I'm fucking kidding.
[54:04.61]Do you even have a face?
[54:10.89]No, how big should the nose be?
[54:14.36]Nothing extreme.
[54:16.12]Because that's just, like, dumb.
[54:18.70]I can go absurd with this shit.
[54:32.67]Where's, like, the... Hold on.
[54:37.70]Where did I get the... I know I can tilt.
[54:52.96]Where's the thing to pull it down?
[54:54.69]I just want to show you this.
[54:57.53]Because it's fucking crazy.
[55:01.71]If I can get it to catch on it, you'll see.
[55:05.89]Just how stupid this is.
[55:16.94]That's nothing.
[55:17.44]Like, if I can get the camera in the right place...
[55:21.14]You can actually do some stupid shit.
[55:24.26]Somebody has to be a dinosaur.
[55:39.49]Damn it, come on.
[55:42.25]It's just so hard to grab.
[55:44.98]Is there a way that I can make it do, like, tilt or stretch?
[55:48.96]Or do I have to have it be in the exact spot?
[55:51.95]Is there a certain combination of buttons I can do?
[56:01.29]Hold shift?
[56:04.62]Detail edit?
[56:05.28]Because, yeah, see, I'm trying to get the little tilt thing.
[56:13.92]Because I can pull this all the way down to the ground if I want.
[56:20.42]I'm certain of it.
[56:29.59]I gotta get the combination to do it.
[56:31.31]Because it's crazy.
[56:36.05]Make the nose small first.
[56:37.53]Alright, there.
[56:40.93]There.
[56:43.07]Not that one.
[56:44.49]Alright, right here.
[56:45.05]That's what I'm looking for.
[56:46.81]I want that on the nose.
[56:56.14]Come on.
[56:56.70]Let me see it.
[57:00.33]I'm just making Michael Cera.
[57:12.78]Come on, do it!
[57:14.80]Just do it!
[57:21.91]No!
[57:25.91]Oh, whatever.
[57:46.07]Make it normal.
[57:46.63]This is supposed to be an apple, right?
[57:54.32]Yeah.
[58:01.79]Pull the bridge out.
[58:02.54]It's too deep.
[58:18.13]He needs to be way fatter than this.
[58:28.88]That's not a bad head shape.
[58:29.90]When I said square, what I'm talking about is, you know how an apple has sort of the beefy buff chest and then comes down a little bit?
[58:51.09]Some of you guys know what I'm talking about.
[58:54.05]That's fine.
[59:02.14]Any bigger than that?
[59:02.96]That looks good.
[59:03.62]Okay.
[59:09.16]Maybe the head is a little bit bigger.
[59:12.32]Look at that.
[59:12.78]Perfect apple.
[59:14.62]It just is.
[59:15.04]I want to make the head wider, but I don't think I can.
[59:18.28]That's alright.
[59:18.74]It looks good.
[59:22.14]Right?
[59:24.15]The JoJo song.
[59:26.03]I don't know why I just did that.
[59:34.23]That's all I could just hear right there.
[59:36.95]That like... I don't even know what it is.
[59:49.12]What does it say?
[59:49.54]It goes like...
[59:54.59]The torture dance, right.
[59:58.47]Don't ask me why the fuck I just did that, but there it is.
[60:04.63]Vocal percussion on a whole nother level.
[60:06.41]There it is.
[60:06.75]For those of you that are watching, I've never seen that show.
[60:11.68]I don't know what it is.
[60:20.64]And we want like a big happy family for the apple.
[60:30.47]Love?
[60:31.57]Nature?
[60:37.13]No.
[60:37.41]Apples want, like, a big, huge... Look, that's an apple tree.
[60:40.75]Very, very clear.
[60:47.20]Self-assured.
[60:47.88]They're kind of assholes.
[60:48.92]They think they're the best fruit in the bunch.
[60:54.86]No, he's not done.
[60:56.04]I just want to get this out of the way first.
[61:07.59]I love the halfway out with this.
[61:10.39]Oh, we didn't get to see it.
[61:14.62]That's sicko.
[61:16.52]You're fucked up.
[61:19.96]Okay.
[61:22.18]How does this sound?
[61:22.84]Hmm.
[61:23.14]Hmm.
[61:40.43]That's perfect for me.
[61:44.19]Alright, we're gonna add hair.
[61:45.13]We need a stem.
[61:52.80]That's not gonna work.
[61:53.42]That's way too frayed out to be a stem.
[61:57.82]Is there a single ponytail I can put up?
[62:00.94]What about the bun?
[62:06.14]That's pretty close.
[62:07.63]So is that.
[62:12.45]Oh god.
[62:14.17]But that could be a tomato.
[62:15.37]That's not even a fucking apple.
[62:22.40]It doesn't need to be brown?
[62:26.90]What about this one?
[62:27.82]This one's a little smaller.
[62:34.23]I think that's as close as it's gonna be.
[62:42.40]Alright, what about for clothes?
[62:45.46]Tomato is a fruit.
[62:50.21]Should he just have no clothes on at all?
[62:51.79]I feel like an apple wouldn't have any clothes on.
[62:57.03]Apple's very basic.
[62:58.55]Doesn't need anything.
[63:08.21]You don't add stuff to apples.
[63:10.37]You just eat it.
[63:12.06]At least make the underwear red.
[63:13.22]Yeah, I'll try.
[63:14.10]What do you got right now?
[63:18.67]Can I make it red?
[63:19.27]I can.
[63:22.43]Alright, this is Apple Andy.
[63:25.33]Actually, it should be Andy Apple.
[63:28.33]Last name's gonna be the fruit.
[63:36.66]Change into a formal... Change this into a formal outfit.
[63:40.42]This is everyday.
[63:41.56]Formal.
[63:45.02]No, I'm keeping that.
[63:46.78]I'm not taking this off.
[63:55.14]Why would I take that off?
[63:55.96]Now who's next in this shit show?
[64:02.12]Alright, we're gonna go with five...
[64:08.04]What's left?
[64:08.68]Apple, pear, banana, apple, blueberry.
[64:22.78]Do we already have a berry?
[64:24.18]Is it berry banana?
[64:25.98]No, it's Benedict banana.
[64:27.24]OK.
[64:27.32]OK.
[64:37.90]The candy one, that sounds better.
[64:39.42]Wait, wouldn't Blue- No, Blueberry would have a tiny head.
[64:47.47]Not a big one.
[64:51.13]Wouldn't Blueberry be little?
[64:57.02]Did you say Blueberry Andy?
[64:59.66]Why would I make this guy's name Blueberry Andy?
[65:07.94]Okay, let's detail this up.
[65:19.56]I think the chin, everything has to come up.
[65:21.54]Everything.
[65:23.00]Small.
[65:24.88]Condensed.
[65:39.17]I'm losing his neck here.
[65:45.32]Let's, uh... First of all, let's make you... What?
[65:49.98]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[65:50.80]Yeah, yeah.
[65:55.69]Smaller head or riot.
[65:57.07]I can't make it that much smaller.
[65:59.67]That's as small as I can make it.
[66:08.88]Without distorting, I mean, why is it that long?
[66:12.42]Okay, that looks not bad at all, actually.
[66:23.64]Let me just go in here.
[67:09.48]Do the eyebrows.
[67:14.52]Should the blueberry just have eyebrows?
[67:24.65]Why would that happen?
[67:26.15]I don't know why the blueberry has big ears.
[67:43.06]Nice looking good Hold on, I gotta fix that fix it
[68:24.49]Eyes gotta be a little smaller.
[68:25.47]They're taking up too much space.
[68:34.63]Holy fuck.
[68:37.03]He looks like he's in pain.
[68:49.59]I gotta bring this in.
[68:52.07]In.
[68:53.49]Come in!
[68:57.31]You look like a guy wearing a Slipknot mask.
[69:05.54]Okay, I wanna bring this up and pull this back.
[69:30.00]Oops.
[69:35.40]Oh, no.
[69:36.00]I think I broke it.
[69:40.28]No, I didn't.
[69:40.80]We're good.
[69:49.91]This is Gonzo.
[69:52.69]From the Muppets, is who this is turning into.
[69:59.57]Alright, back to normal.
[70:04.89]I think my hands are up right now.
[70:18.42]How big... I need to make you a little bit smaller.
[70:26.74]Okay, let's go... No, this is fine.
[70:31.29]Barry Blueberry is done.
[70:35.91]This is just a house of the Gusher's Fruit people.
[70:38.07]Yeah, it kind of is.
[70:38.99]Alright, Barry.
[70:45.20]No, we need clothes.
[70:46.30]Everyone just can't be naked.
[70:47.36]Okay.
[71:05.04]Make him short?
[71:05.80]I can't.
[71:08.62]I can't without making him a child.
[71:12.24]I can't do it, and I can't have a child in this game.
[71:26.01]Guys, this is gonna be like a fucking long-ass stream, okay?
[71:34.86]Alright, here we go.
[71:38.40]Smaller, smaller.
[71:39.40]I can't.
[71:40.64]I can't do it.
[71:42.36]It's gonna fuck it all up if I go down to... No!
[71:47.34]His whole head is... Everything's gonna be fucked up.
[71:49.18]All of his head is gonna be misshaped.
[71:50.64]I'm gonna have to do it all over again.
[71:54.74]No, do you see how long this took?
[71:57.02]I'm not making Barry Blueberry again.
[72:04.30]The undo button with control Z?
[72:09.29]If this fucks it up, I'm gonna scream.
[72:10.65]Okay, it works.
[72:26.08]Do you understand?
[72:28.08]Teen didn't do anything.
[72:29.62]See?
[72:30.98]Young Adele didn't do anything.
[72:33.36]You have to make them a child.
[72:38.58]No, no, no, how far?
[72:39.54]Oh, thank god.
[72:40.14]Do you understand why this cannot be in the game?
[72:47.40]Guys.
[72:52.41]Nope, I'm sorry.
[72:54.91]I gotta stand on my moral soapbox here.
[73:01.87]Old man.
[73:06.07]No, we're gonna keep it the way it was.
[73:07.11]You have to make a prune?
[73:16.37]Alright, let's get through.
[73:17.99]We've got berry blueberries.
[73:18.99]Let's get the, uh, aspirations.
[73:20.97]It's a brain food.
[73:25.12]Nerd brain.
[73:25.92]Uh, blueberries are a little on the, uh, they're blue, right?
[73:41.89]Childish.
[73:52.20]Berry blueberry, there you go, okay.
[73:54.52]Now we need another one.
[73:55.46]Alright, I'm kind of sick of the fruit theme at this point.
[74:01.74]This is one house, one apartment.
[74:06.60]So we've got pear, apple, pear, banana, apple, blueberry.
[74:18.15]Grape?
[74:21.43]Baby carrot or riot?
[74:23.03]No.
[74:27.03]I ain't gonna have, I ain't gonna be the guy that... No, uh-uh.
[74:34.55]Grandpa lemon?
[74:39.37]Let me see what I can do here.
[74:43.05]We could do... What else is green?
[74:48.48]Lettuce?
[74:50.00]Larry Lettuce?
[74:52.08]Is that gonna work?
[74:57.66]Lenny Lettuce.
[75:07.30]Lemon, lemon, lemon.
[75:08.22]We don't have like a pure yellow, yellow, yellow.
[75:13.78]A kiwi?
[75:14.60]Yeah, but I kind of like grandpa lettuce.
[75:19.06]Can I make a piece of lettuce?
[75:20.22]Let's see.
[75:21.04]What would lettuce be?
[75:26.68]But that's not a fruit though.
[75:29.26]We'll do a lime.
[75:32.24]Or a raisin.
[75:33.24]We'll see what we get.
[75:39.38]Let's go in here.
[75:48.56]Hmm.
[75:49.72]I actually like it already.
[75:53.06]Just a big head for a raisin.
[76:01.54]I'm done.
[76:06.19]Whoa.
[76:07.69]Say, get now.
[76:11.11]I'm not gonna do any more.
[76:11.85]This is it.
[76:26.02]Fix the shoes?
[76:30.35]What's wrong with the Donald Duck shoes?
[76:42.73]It's a prune.
[76:49.70]Grandpa prune.
[76:59.20]Alright, I gotta change the nose a little bit though.
[77:01.22]If it's grandpa, grandpa has to have like a really bulbous fucked up nose.
[77:17.85]If it is a grandpa.
[77:28.33]How's that?
[77:29.29]Not too crazy.
[77:30.24]Just enough.
[77:41.36]I have to keep it.
[77:52.45]Jesus Christ, I can't even select anything.
[77:54.27]A little on the buggy side.
[78:06.35]He's old.
[78:07.87]Not that much, though.
[78:12.87]Alright, can I get rid of the Wolverine sideburns?
[78:29.99]Oh god, it's like broken.
[78:30.93]A little bit more.
[78:38.24]That's got to be bulbed.
[79:10.76]I need the front.
[79:12.96]There we go.
[79:19.85]That's better.
[79:20.35]Okay, good.
[79:20.71]I need the eyes to be spread out a little more than that.
[79:38.89]Bring him up.
[79:42.65]Nah, that's too much clipping.
[79:50.97]Okay, I'm good with that.
[79:51.65]There they are.
[79:57.87]You just made the old guy from up?
[80:01.45]Yeah, I did.
[80:02.91]Now I'm gonna leave it like that.
[80:04.57]Except for the sideburns, they look just stupid.
[80:08.55]Now I miss them.
[80:10.07]Shit.
[80:10.63]I miss those sideburns now.
[80:22.48]Mustache, maybe?
[80:37.95]Somebody's gotta have a beard, right?
[80:44.27]No, I don't... The Wolverine looks just... It doesn't look good.
[80:53.36]That one's fine.
[81:01.33]I don't like this one because it takes away from his face.
[81:16.04]Bring the shoulders in.
[81:17.26]Okay, make the ass a little bit bigger.
[81:36.56]Prunes aren't blue.
[81:41.98]Yeah, well, I can't... I can't make anybody, like, purple.
[81:47.94]All I can do is give them... Look, I gave them the correct hair color.
[82:00.67]Make them more wrinkly?
[82:01.81]Okay.
[82:15.28]Let's get the name here.
[82:19.47]Should I just make him green and just call him... like a Kiwi or something?
[82:30.32]I'm gonna keep the eyebrows, I think.
[82:33.22]Maybe not, because he has facial hair, so why wouldn't I keep the eyebrows?
[82:37.62]Meh.
[82:52.12]He does look like a Warcraft gnome.
[82:56.02]It just is.
[82:57.26]Should they be liv- No, this has to be fruits only!
[83:04.19]Just pretend he's a Warcraft gnome.
[83:11.79]Peter Plum.
[83:19.77]Alright, alright, alright.
[83:20.65]We got one, two, three, four, five in the fruit household.
[83:28.69]Let's do some detail work here on the face.
[83:33.41]What the fuck is this?
[83:44.06]It's the creepypasta plum.
[83:47.74]With YouTuber hair.
[83:55.00]Put him back.
[83:56.66]What is going on?
[83:57.86]What are these?
[83:58.96]Look at this shit.
[83:59.94]What's with the weird smiling shit?
[84:03.62]I don't know what that means.
[84:06.66]That's just a terrible selfie.
[84:08.34]These are all just bad selfies.
[84:11.36]You go through and you delete these in your phone.
[84:23.38]Okay, more wrinkles.
[84:29.75]This is a fate.
[84:30.77]No, this will screw it all up.
[84:32.23]Skin detail.
[84:43.80]Laugh lines.
[84:45.22]I guess you can kind of see them.
[84:48.44]Alright, Peter Plum is ready.
[84:50.22]Different clothes, though.
[84:51.02]These clothes suck.
[85:13.38]Not even purple.
[85:18.04]You don't have purple here?
[85:18.88]That's fine.
[85:28.33]It is a vet shirt, isn't it?
[85:29.73]Yeah, I'm just realizing this now.
[85:33.96]There.
[85:34.08]Better.
[85:34.80]Better.
[85:42.40]Alright, here's the fruit household.
[85:43.42]We've got Pauline and Pear, Benedict Banana, Andy Apple, Berry Blueberry, and Peter Plum.
[85:52.32]He's still a vet?
[85:52.92]That's fine, he's a vet.
[86:01.31]Change that shirt.
[86:02.01]No.
[86:10.49]Alright, let's move them in and we can make another family.
[86:12.49]I have to make a drug dealer.
[86:13.85]We gotta make the gnome a drug dealer.
[86:15.33]I'm gonna make him the only one that's worth a shit in this house.
[86:37.10]Okay.
[86:38.12]More than five is too much.
[86:42.32]This family is ready to go.
[86:43.24]Let's make sure I double-check.
[86:45.52]Pauline Pear.
[86:47.00]There's Benedict Banana.
[86:48.68]There's the apple.
[86:50.85]No, you need to be in your everyday wear.
[86:55.45]Nice berry.
[86:55.95]Blueberry.
[86:58.63]And you got Peter Blanc.
[87:04.37]Okay.
[87:07.65]Name him Ben Anna.
[87:09.73]Blueberry.
[87:17.08]Leper gnome.
[87:18.34]I can't get over that.
[87:19.50]I'm trying to get over it.
[87:20.48]I can't.
[87:27.15]Peter Plum is the wrong color.
[87:29.13]It doesn't matter.
[87:29.89]Who cares?
[87:30.45]Is that better?
[87:52.20]Make him just rotten.
[88:01.45]Gray food.
[88:12.26]What color is a plum?
[88:16.40]Second row.
[88:20.51]What color is a plump?
[88:22.59]Let me see.
[88:23.35]Plump.
[88:29.41]It's, like, purple.
[88:32.16]I think that's... That's actually... I think this is close, so I'm going to get it.
[88:43.14]Yeah, that's too... Let me see.
[88:54.64]Is there purple makeup?
[88:55.64]There might be.
[88:57.88]Probably not full face, though.
[89:03.99]Peter Plum.
[89:07.75]Look at the color of a prune.
[89:09.67]Prune.
[89:13.99]The prunes are like... The prunes are raisins.
[89:21.40]Now that's close enough.
[89:29.74]Just go download more colors?
[89:40.75]Is there actually like a... can I actually get a mod that... Yeah, but I'd have to leave the game.
[89:49.53]Prunes are Phrasins.
[89:52.29]Get the color wheel mod.
[89:55.02]Yeah, you know, it's probably simple.
[89:59.26]Can any of the mods give me just a quick link while I finish this up?
[90:02.95]Because I'll get, like, actual, like, purple.
[90:06.85]It'll be worth it, yeah.
[90:07.77]It will.
[90:08.55]We're taking this long to set this up anyways.
[90:13.69]Yeah, most of the mods for The Sims 4, you just drag into the mod folder anyways.
[90:28.10]Let me just close this out.
[90:29.02]I can edit the family at any time, so... This is good to go.
[90:32.94]We'll get that later.
[90:35.44]You have to save the family, though, to use the mod.
[90:39.05]That's all good.
[90:39.61]Okay, so I got this family.
[90:40.87]We're gonna move them in.
[90:42.67]Let's see.
[90:45.43]Click the check to save the pear household.
[90:48.11]No, this is the... No, this is the fruits.
[90:54.69]The fruits household.
[91:04.97]Okay, I need to make sure the game is saved.
[91:10.65]That's better.
[91:11.51]No.
[91:17.15]Okay, the fruits.
[91:22.61]So they've got 28 grand.
[91:24.08]Let me just cheat real quick.
[91:40.50]Oh, wait, okay, hold on.
[91:42.96]So this is for... This is one bedroom, two bath.
[91:45.44]This is four bedroom, three bath.
[91:48.57]Weekly rent is $3,500 a week!
[91:49.53]Who's my neighbor?
[91:50.09]Lobo?
[91:50.21]Alright.
[92:09.40]This is the one that has to be with only five people.
[92:18.22]Furnishings $100,000.
[92:20.54]A huge family home with luxury chef's kitchen.
[92:26.21]This apartment is the epitome of uptown chic living.
[92:33.13]Let's go.
[92:39.08]Remaining funds, negative 87,000.
[92:40.20]I don't want the damn thing furnished.
[92:50.03]I can't even do this.
[92:51.29]I have to move into like a shitty place and then get a bunch of money and move.
[92:57.17]Type free real estate.
[93:08.38]Command failed.
[93:10.42]Free?
[93:10.76]You need to enable cheats.
[93:17.65]Testing cheats on.
[93:19.07]Oh.
[93:19.23]Is it on?
[93:37.44]I need to move a family in first.
[93:38.94]Yeah, so I have to, like, go to one of these shitty places then.
[93:47.37]I'm just going to Google it before I just get debated for the next 30 minutes.
[93:51.35]Sims cheats.
[93:55.74]Open the cheat console.
[93:57.64]Bring up the cheat dialog box.
[93:58.80]Enter cheats.
[93:59.30]Don't forget to press the... Yeah, okay.
[94:00.98]Thanks.
[94:05.13]Thanks for telling me how to open the cheat box.
[94:08.39]Hey, here's how you open the cheat box.
[94:10.52]That's it.
[94:11.42]Okay, thanks.
[94:11.96]Alright, here we go.
[94:18.52]Uh, I'm gonna get like five auto-playing videos.
[94:24.83]Okay.
[94:27.21]Uh, testing cheats space true.
[94:36.72]Okay.
[94:41.29]Now let's see if that does anything.
[94:59.26]What?
[95:03.64]Alright, so I'm just gonna move- I have to move into a random place.
[95:05.86]Why can't I just do it from the menu?
[95:14.88]Alright, I need to find, like, a little shitty apartment.
[95:16.67]Alright, all of us have to move in here.
[95:21.39]Alright, good luck.
[95:24.31]Uh, would you like to move in with or evict the Pizah Evictum?
[95:27.31]Get the fuck out of my way.
[95:39.32]Yeah, I got rid of the pizza family.
[95:40.56]Alright, here we go.
[95:45.10]This is really important.
[95:45.92]I have to, like, pause the game because there are a ton of fucked up mods.
[95:49.58]And I need to be totally sure that nothing happens here when I'm gone.
[95:55.34]Because if I get... Hold on.
[95:59.53]What are you doing?
[96:00.99]No, no, no, no.

[128:27.53]No, you're right.
[128:28.51]Oh, that's...
[128:37.57]Good enough.

[129:26.91]I'll show you what I have for hair.
[129:28.59]It's more like that.
[129:29.27]No, I don't know.
[129:37.28]I don't look like Cyclops.
[129:40.32]Last time I made myself a joke.
[129:41.63]This time I'm going to make what I actually look like.
[130:25.97]Getting there.
[130:42.86]I don't even... hair is not correct.
[130:53.78]Yes, it is.
[131:27.92]I know what I look like and this is what I see in the mirror.
[131:45.30]Put on the webcam to compare.
[131:46.56]Hold on, I will.
[131:49.28]I just gotta put clothes on.
[131:50.34]I gotta put like something on.
[132:05.83]blanket around me.
[132:12.10]OK, here.
[132:15.82]Incoming joke?
[132:16.80]I mean, there's no joke.
[132:18.38]I just don't have any clothes on.
[132:24.61]Let's see.
[132:25.41]Let's see how accurate this is.
[133:36.13]I'm gonna turn this a little.
[134:02.42]This is what I see!
[134:03.92]Okay?
[134:46.45]I think that's good.
[134:55.18]Right?
[135:02.50]There it is.
[135:03.44]Done.
[135:05.28]Done.
[135:07.96]I think that looks pretty close.
[135:26.55]Bigger chin?
[135:27.23]Are you sure?
[135:33.48]No fucking way I don't look like that.
[135:37.10]Bullshit.
[135:39.96]I can't look.
[136:09.76]That's better.
[136:10.16]Are these out far enough?
[136:19.99]See?
[136:36.22]I think that's fine.
[136:37.34]The lips are too big.
[136:50.75]Hold on, let me get in there.
[136:57.13]Okay, that looks fine.
[137:03.37]You gotta grab the corners, though.
[137:08.57]How far?
[137:09.09]This is kind of up.
[137:10.16]Yeah.
[137:18.94]Higher.
[137:23.48]This ratio is wrong.
[137:24.46]These eyebrows could have come down.
[137:28.66]Or the eyes have to go up.
[137:33.25]Yeah, but this has to come down.
[137:34.65]There we go.
[137:54.42]Am I getting there?
[137:56.40]The nose is too big.
[138:08.47]Eyebrows have to change.
[138:26.68]No.
[138:29.95]There we go.
[138:31.99]Bring them down.
[138:35.41]Bring these out.
[139:12.03]I mean, it looks pretty similar.
[139:15.59]Skin tone.
[139:16.27]Yeah.
[139:16.61]Well, hold on.
[139:17.05]You're right.

[140:13.83]No, no I think it's perfect like that
[140:43.39]This is actually what I see in the mirror.
[140:48.02]Eyebrows?
[140:48.48]Look at my eyebrows!
[140:49.42]Look at, look at!
[140:51.82]See?

[141:54.16]Why would I add lipstick?
[142:00.59]Alright, what do I- what do I get for clothes on right now?
[142:02.29]None.
[142:02.63]I actually don't have any.
[142:07.77]No, I wouldn't wear this.
[142:08.77]I wouldn't wear that.
[142:14.18]My chin's bigger than this?
[142:15.72]It is definitely not bigger than- you wanna make it look like a cartoon character?
[142:20.32]Pretty stylish.
[142:23.93]No, I don't want the... No, not the black shirt.
[142:29.41]Let's go with... I don't want to do, like, fucking Civil War soldier.
[142:36.86]Do they have any Star Wars shirts?
[142:42.98]Wait, they probably do.
[142:44.98]They have a Darth Vader mask.
[142:46.80]You're telling me they don't have a Star Wars t-shirt?
[142:53.07]Where the hell is it?
[142:55.12]Come on, Star Wars.
[142:59.36]Damn it.
[143:05.84]No, I don't want the headphones on.
[143:07.28]Let's go full body for a second.
[143:14.64]I am a big fan of Star Wars, but that's not, I'm not, I wouldn't wear this.
[143:20.48]Just be in the Vader costume.
[143:28.77]Alright, this will be my formal outfit, okay?
[143:38.85]Every day though, let's go with like a tank top.
[143:42.19]Okay, t-shirts.
[143:43.87]Star Wars.
[143:44.95]Star Wars.
[143:47.48]Tank top.

[143:54.82]That's fine.
[143:56.75]Bottoms.
[143:58.73]Let's go with... I mean... It's a pair of jeans.
[144:07.45]Yeah, that's fine.
[144:11.23]That's pretty close to what I would wear.
[144:15.89]Especially in Las Vegas.
[144:21.72]Put those things away.
[144:23.35]What do you mean put the- what things?
[144:24.89]Alright, I'm happy with this.
[144:30.73]My personality?
[144:31.65]I'm an animal!
[144:35.13]No, I would say let's do like creativity.
[144:38.64]I mean like genius.
[144:41.20]Best-selling author.
[144:43.78]Knowledge.
[144:44.76]Really smart.
[144:46.70]Computer whiz.
[144:49.42]Wicked popular joke star.
[144:55.79]Leader of the pack.
[144:56.77]I'm a leader.
[144:58.77]Little hot-headed.
[145:00.83]Very, very creative, aren't I?
[145:04.60]And I also am very clumsy.
[145:09.84]I'm good.
[145:16.56]No, fine.
[145:20.76]So who lives here?
[145:21.62]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[145:22.30]I've made this person.
[145:26.48]That is not at all what the person probably looks like.
[145:31.77]Can I go back and delete?
[145:33.41]How do I delete somebody else's character?
[145:35.45]You know what I mean?
[145:36.77]Seriously.
[145:41.30]Alright, let's add a dog.
[145:46.72]What kind of breed?
[145:47.36]Uh... No, we're not making auto.
[145:55.55]Let's make... A little fucked up on the face, that's fine.
[146:20.66]Extra large nose.
[146:23.94]This is the Budweiser dog, yeah.
[146:35.73]Looks good.
[146:40.75]It's a giant rat.
[146:43.53]Mm-hmm.
[146:45.36]It's a giant rat.
[146:48.20]Perfect.
[146:50.32]What about the tail here?
[146:51.20]I can change the tail.
[146:54.16]No, rat tails are thin.
[147:01.04]Little legs, if I can make them smaller.
[147:08.84]Let's go in detail mode here.
[147:14.40]Can I make these any bigger?
[147:34.93]Now it just looks like a bird.
[147:36.11]A duck.
[147:43.16]Eyes all the way back.
[147:43.84]It's a rat.
[147:54.63]It does look sad.
[147:55.57]Yeah, I gotta make it... I gotta make the dog not sad.
[147:57.77]The rat, whatever.
[148:07.28]You just always look sad.
[148:10.05]Why?
[148:10.37]Why do you look sad?
[148:14.89]There we go.
[148:29.92]Make the body bigger.
[148:42.75]That's so creepy looking.
[148:43.85]Okay.
[148:45.27]I think that's good.
[148:45.85]I think it's a mouth that's doing it.
[149:04.12]How big are rats' ears?
[149:06.32]Are they huge?
[149:07.06]They're big, right?
[149:08.80]No, they're tiny.
[149:09.56]How big are they?
[149:20.27]They're like that.
[149:23.11]They're massive.
[149:23.89]Let me say rat.
[149:28.01]Yeah, they're little tiny.
[149:28.83]They look like this.
[149:35.23]Okay, here we go.
[149:37.84]Now we need to have a different coat here.
[149:47.88]I think I can just do fur, right?
[149:52.97]Here we go.
[149:53.33]There we go.
[149:59.77]That's kind of rat-like.
[150:05.68]That's pretty close.
[150:09.02]That's better.
[150:13.30]That's better.
[150:13.72]Yeah, paint the tail pink.
[150:16.80]Paint the tail and paws pink.
[150:19.34]That's a good idea.
[150:19.94]Alright, let's paint.
[150:35.93]And the ears.
[150:43.61]God damn it.
[150:54.20]That not so pink.

[153:15.58]Alright, you're good.
[153:16.82]Now let's get your paws.
[153:29.75]This is disturbing.
[153:39.50]That's how far it goes up, right?
[153:49.14]Oops.
[153:51.74]It goes up a little further.
[153:55.52]I painted on his knees.
[153:58.37]I didn't mean to, but that's okay.
[153:59.65]I'm going to give it an eraser.
[154:07.21]I'll clean it up.
[154:11.94]Gloves.

[154:15.68]Perfect!
[154:16.20]Alright, stand up.
[154:17.54]Let's get a good look at you.
[154:32.44]That's just a quick little reference to people that saw the last one.
[154:42.87]Okay, let's draw whiskers.
[154:50.36]Kind of already done for us here.
[154:54.26]No, I can do them myself.
[154:56.18]Thank you very much.
[154:59.83]Which way do they go?
[155:00.73]Out?
[155:14.71]What do they look?
[155:15.57]Rat face.
[155:20.25]No, they're only... The nose is pink, too.
[155:29.68]Here, stand up straight.
[155:30.44]Let me see that nose.
[155:33.66]Oh, I can't do the nose.
[155:36.19]Nose is unpaintable, guys.
[155:38.37]Sorry.
[155:38.53]Sorry.
[155:47.99]Or maybe I could do it on the nose option.
[155:50.85]Alright, let's give them whiskers first.
[155:59.10]They gotta be smaller than that.
[156:01.44]And they gotta be clear.
[156:05.92]Like gray.
[156:18.12]Alright.
[156:22.65]Let's go to the nose.
[156:27.09]Tails.

[156:40.35]Just click on his nose?
[156:51.76]The eyes though, the eyes have to be... Yep, there we go.
[156:57.82]Holy shit, that's pretty close.
[157:08.29]Get rid of the whiskers.
[157:09.31]The whiskers just fuck it all up.
[157:19.95]Oh no, I kind of missed them though.
[157:23.05]Hold on, let me try again.
[157:23.85]Let's go with, like, three.
[157:38.03]What even worse proximity?
[157:55.63]That's like a cat, though.
[157:56.53]Get a little darker.
[158:12.72]Got it!
[158:22.59]Alright.

[158:36.02]These paws need to be cleaned up a little bit.
[158:37.68]I'm not gonna just have to suck.
[158:50.63]Bigger brush.
[158:54.46]I'm not just gonna have to suck, guys.

[159:25.63]Giant rat.
[159:29.41]And let's go with another... I'm just going to see what I can do here.
[159:33.14]I'm going to make... We'll find out.
[159:37.48]Here we go.
[159:43.31]Clear everything.
[159:47.28]Clear hair.
[159:49.46]All hair.
[159:49.94]Alright.
[159:50.30]Alright.
[159:50.52]Let's start.
[159:53.07]Start with the nose first.
[160:02.05]Get me out there.
[160:02.83]What do I grab?
[160:04.21]I want to grab this.
[160:16.01]I have to make an elephant.
[160:24.42]Come on now.
[160:30.37]Let me just grab in there.

[161:37.96]Okay.
[162:02.51]How much further down can that go?
[162:03.65]I think that's as far as it can go.
[162:13.11]Unless I can... No, that's perfect right there.
[162:20.87]Wait a minute.
[162:21.33]No, fuck it.
[162:21.81]I'm making a goddamn bird.
[162:23.80]This is a bird.
[162:24.70]This is a beak.
[162:31.86]It's like a pelican.
[162:46.50]I need to make this mouth much smaller.
[162:54.53]This is just... I'm making the seagull.
[162:57.07]Here.
[162:57.49]Saved forever.
[163:05.93]Um...
[163:16.73]Well, never mind.
[163:37.66]It's a faucet.
[163:50.37]Delete this.
[163:51.99]No.
[163:53.47]It's staying.
[164:12.64]This is terrifying.
[164:17.09]Make the eyes red?
[164:24.88]Ugh.
[164:35.03]This needs to come up.
[164:49.36]That's better.
[164:59.13]I need to get that mouth much smaller.
[165:07.96]Maybe actually, hold on.
[165:09.64]Bring this back up a little.
[165:15.55]Wait, that's good.
[165:50.12]Okay.
[165:54.57]That's a pretty good elephant.
[165:58.71]Just gotta do the ears.
[166:06.05]Oh, easy!
[166:25.77]No, I gotta go bigger than that.
[166:27.13]They can't go bigger than that?
[166:32.71]I don't know why there's an elephant living in this house.
[166:41.79]Please kill this one right away.
[166:43.39]Oh, I must just throw up.
[166:48.28]This dream hadn't even gotten started yet, guys.
[166:53.28]You guys understand that we haven't even begun?
[167:04.35]I wonder, is the... I mean, elephants' heads are fucking huge.
[167:09.21]They are huge.
[167:10.98]But that's just... That doesn't look right.
[167:13.36]It looks strange.
[167:21.14]There's five and a half thousand people here for the pre-stream.
[167:23.83]Welcome.
[167:24.11]Hope you're having a good time.
[167:25.53]We haven't even started the stream yet.
[167:29.91]This looks like Stuart Little, somebody said.
[167:36.69]That's better.
[167:37.17]It can't be that ridiculously huge.
[167:40.03]I need to get... See, when I go into detail mode, can I spin them?
[167:43.59]Alright, here we go.
[167:45.87]Oh, come on now.
[167:47.41]Don't do this to me.
[167:57.68]Better?
[167:57.90]I think they're out more now.
[167:59.96]Alright, what do elephants wear for clothes?
[168:08.29]Fix his eyes.
[168:08.99]I don't know if I want to.
[168:10.33]I feel like I want it like this.
[168:13.45]For some reason.
[168:24.26]No, they're better out.
[168:35.91]Oh, shit.
[168:36.21]I fucked it all up.
[168:46.89]There we go.
[168:53.88]Okay.
[168:55.60]I like it like that.
[168:56.40]I like it the way it is.
[169:04.37]Let's go with... Well, elephant doesn't wear clothes.
[169:19.49]Can I make him go down on all fours?
[169:25.81]This gotta be a jokey feat, right?
[169:33.92]Come on.
[169:34.76]You gotta have something strange, like a goofball outfit down here.

[173:43.72]We've got all our dickheads.
[173:44.98]I need one more animal.
[173:47.71]One more animal.
[173:48.47]Final animal.
[173:50.65]Cat.
[173:50.85]Cat.
[174:02.41]Alright, Bolognese.
[174:04.03]Let's... How do we pick breed?
[174:14.44]No.
[174:14.90]Breed.
[174:17.00]Head shape.
[174:17.79]Where is it?
[174:19.15]I just missed it.
[174:20.83]Get deleted.
[174:21.35]Alright, hold on.
[174:28.35]Breed, breed, breed, breed, breed.
[174:33.72]I want a cat with a very, very small head.
[174:48.44]Like a big-ass neck.
[174:51.00]Mm-mm.
[174:54.44]Oh, boy.
[174:57.40]Alright, should I make one of the human skin cats?
[175:20.30]Let's get in there.
[175:41.11]No, I don't want you to be, like, eyes crossed.
[175:57.79]I'm turning this cat into a dog.
[176:04.65]It's just a dog.
[176:06.35]Not, hold on, not yet.
[176:13.51]I like that though.
[176:23.83]Yeah, big thick neck.
[176:32.27]No, you guys, I don't think you guys got it right.
[176:33.71]This is the statue gargoyle things from the first Ghostbusters movie.
[176:47.33]How big is this thing?
[176:54.82]Tail, let's make the tail big.
[176:56.12]Alright, looking good.
[177:02.68]No, that's good.
[177:03.78]A little bit bigger.
[177:04.86]Make the neck a little longer.
[177:13.81]Oh, I didn't do, uh... Fluffy.
[177:16.15]No.
[177:16.75]Select traits.
[177:18.43]Exchievous.
[177:21.75]Territorial.
[177:24.16]Wow!
[177:25.00]Okay.
[177:27.10]And a prowler.
[177:29.56]This thing's scary to me.
[177:31.06]I don't like this.
[177:48.90]Are you wearing, like, a Dragon Ball Z t-shirt?
[177:50.80]What the fuck is this?
[177:57.34]No.
[177:57.90]Get that off.
[178:11.17]I don't like... I hate it.
[178:26.22]Let's go over here.
[178:27.00]Oh, let's see.
[178:38.63]Like flames?
[178:41.11]Would flames work on the cat?
[178:42.51]Like a car?
[178:43.05]Like a fast car?
[178:50.67]No.
[178:53.82]It's not the right color.
[179:00.38]I need a good, like, fire.
[179:01.54]Here we go.
[179:12.64]This is like feathers.
[179:16.81]No, I don't like it.
[179:18.55]This might be better.
[179:21.23]That's a little better.
[179:22.75]No.
[179:27.39]This looks like somebody put paint on a cat.
[179:34.09]Oh, wait.
[179:39.36]Fire, come on.
[179:41.36]Ooh, fire?
[179:49.04]Not quite.
[179:57.61]No.
[180:08.44]This is prehistoric, Cap.
[180:11.81]It's like stone.
[180:15.31]You guys have seen the Fantastic Four?
[180:18.93]You know that character, The Thing?
[181:01.00]It's like a rock.
[181:01.60]It's not tire marks.
[181:06.06]It's not tire marks.
[181:07.16]I'm going to make that clear.
[181:15.19]God damn it.
[181:16.47]Now I have to get rid of these.
[181:17.35]That's so fucking awful.
[181:26.66]I'm not going to have...
[181:38.75]It is Vroomer's cat.
[181:51.71]No, that's too dark.
[181:53.29]This is too dark.
[182:15.83]It's too dark, I don't know if I can do this.
[182:26.30]No, poor cat.
[182:31.40]No, I can't, that's too terrible.
[182:33.42]That's awful.
[182:45.67]This is just the shit in the ass all over again from last time.
[182:54.48]Alright, what if the cat didn't get run over?
[182:56.70]But, it's just, it's Vroomer's cat.
[183:03.49]So, he has a certain tattoo.
[183:10.47]That's worse.
[183:12.11]It's not worse.
[183:14.97]He's trying to justify it.
[183:16.29]No, I'm trying to correct my wrong ways.
[183:19.17]It looks too sad.
[183:28.51]I can't.
[183:28.93]It's just a rash.
[183:42.56]Vertical tire marks.
[183:46.74]He ran over the whole cat's whole body.
[183:57.24]This is terrible.
[184:03.81]That's worse.
[184:04.39]It's worse.
[184:08.49]I hate this.
[184:09.79]I hate this butt.
[184:10.78]It's a tattoo.
[184:15.39]Just delete it all.
[184:18.36]We're done.
[184:29.78]Sim 5 doesn't even have a name.
[184:37.45]I don't even know what to call it.
[184:42.71]This cat.
[184:43.34]How about...
[184:45.81]Nine, uh... No, I'm not gonna give it roadkill.
[184:51.87]I've removed the tire marks.
[184:55.33]Not speed bump.
[184:56.33]You guys are fucking awful.
[185:00.16]You guys are terrible.
[185:01.54]Eight lives!
[185:06.66]Holy shit, you guys are awful.
[185:21.82]This is the last family.
[185:24.10]Move them in.
[185:28.52]Carfield.
[185:29.04]There they are.
[185:31.08]This bird doesn't even have a name.
[185:34.14]Fuck this guy.
[185:34.74]Who cares?
[185:35.18]What's this guy's name?
[185:38.56]An elephant.
[185:44.13]Uh...
[185:56.21]There.
[185:56.97]How's that for a name?
[185:59.73]You ready?
[186:10.58]Oh, the rat needs traits.
[186:11.86]A hunter.
[186:15.34]And?
[186:16.45]Friendly.
[186:17.51]And?
[186:18.51]A little bit stubborn.
[186:19.31]A little, uh, pretty vocal.
[186:21.93]Troublemaker.
[186:22.51]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[186:23.39]Trouble, okay.
[186:24.27]We need troublemaker.
[186:27.94]We need... not friendly.
[186:34.74]Uh, hunter.
[186:36.04]Praying at night.
[186:36.80]Stalking, like, hunting at night.
[186:39.48]So we got... making trouble, hunting, and then... uh, stubborn.
[186:45.06]Well, not vocal, because they sing.
[186:54.58]You got traits, right?
[186:57.21]Yes.
[186:57.89]Everybody all set?
[186:59.71]Are we ready to start playing the game?
[187:05.31]I don't remember what we made.
[187:06.25]Alright, I think we're good to go.
[187:14.83]Here we go.
[187:15.65]Welcome to the stream, guys.
[187:16.45]It only took us about three and a half hours to set it up.
[187:19.05]Change the animal voices again?
[187:20.33]How do I do that?
[187:41.15]Uh, how do I change his voice?
[187:43.68]Top left, Dumbo.
[187:51.12]Tough.
[187:52.72]Too low.
[187:54.74]Deep.
[188:02.74]Let's see if I can get a good one here.
[188:04.84]Hey, it's me, the giant rat.
[188:11.60]Yay.
[188:13.64]It's pretty good.
[188:18.42]I'm ready.
[188:18.74]Oh, the cat needs it too.
[188:31.40]What?
[188:34.07]This is a... This is a bird?
[188:42.63]It's gonna stay like that.
[188:48.07]My voice is fine.
[188:49.03]Alright, let's play The Sims 4.
[188:56.63]Time to go.
[189:03.62]We're gonna be saving frequently.
[189:07.54]The tutorial just ended.
[189:09.86]Need a place for them to move.
[189:25.59]I like this one.
[189:32.33]That's perfect.
[189:33.23]I like it.
[189:35.07]You look just scary in every single photo.
[189:40.87]New cool 3D world!
[189:43.55]So in here we have the fruits.
[189:48.03]Then Mr. Lobo.
[189:50.42]You've also got the Reinhardt family.
[189:53.53]And then the gnome.
[190:00.02]So where... I need three bedrooms?
[190:05.02]28 grand.
[190:06.10]Could go here.
[190:06.68]How many bedrooms are in here?
[190:08.48]Two.
[190:08.88]This lives right next to the gnome.
[190:12.40]Two beds.
[190:13.19]Two beds.
[190:13.67]I can throw another bed in there.
[190:15.11]Who cares?
[190:15.57]This one's a little bigger.
[190:25.83]You do not want to be next to the gnome.
[190:28.87]No, I don't, but... I think it'll be okay.
[190:37.23]Take a pee break?
[190:39.03]Yeah, you know, it's been three hours.
[190:40.47]I'm gonna grab a drink.
[190:43.15]We're going probably all night.
[190:45.87]Just to let you guys know.
[190:56.26]So, go take a piss.
[190:59.29]I'm gonna grab a drink.
[191:00.57]And I'll see you guys for a, probably, stream that's gonna be for at least another four or five hours.
[191:05.52]Be right back.
[195:03.03]Alright, let's get this show on the road.
[195:09.79]Thank you for hanging out in the creation of the three, four families here.
[195:17.43]All the mods ago.
[195:18.13]Let's do it.
[195:29.98]So who do we want to play with first?
[195:33.38]I need to save the game, first of all.
[195:41.66]It begins.
[195:50.84]Whoever's gonna die the fastest... I think we have to start with the Reinhards.
[195:55.42]Makes the most sense.
[196:00.96]Reality can be whatever I want.
[196:06.29]1800 second slow-vote.
[196:10.03]Holy shit.
[196:13.32]This is where we're going.
[196:14.12]I'm gonna put another bed in here.
[196:17.14]It's a little small, but it needs TLC.
[196:19.68]Somebody said don't do that.
[196:20.76]Lively neighbors, that makes sense, because the drug-dealing gnome is over here.
[196:32.11]Let's see, what's in here?
[196:34.85]Oh!
[196:37.14]No, this place is too expensive.
[196:42.28]I can't afford the pool?
[196:44.85]What's in here?
[196:48.39]Alright.
[196:48.77]Didn't I kill these people?
[196:49.73]No, I didn't save it.
[196:50.61]Okay, this is a party place.
[196:53.04]We're downstairs.
[196:54.46]This is a quake zone.
[196:55.54]What does that mean?
[196:56.18]Quake zone.
[197:00.36]Oh, no.
[197:00.52]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[197:03.26]I gotta do this free real estate cheat thing.
[197:04.70]I have to be in a game for that to happen, though, right?
[197:15.33]Uh, not... I don't for this, do I?
[197:16.91]Didn't I try this last time?
[197:17.99]Alright, there we go.
[197:31.22]Alright, let's do it.
[197:33.72]Let's move downstairs underneath those people, those partiers.
[197:41.30]Where was that, over here?
[197:43.44]Alright, there's two bedrooms, two baths.
[197:46.65]We live underneath the karaoke legends.
[197:51.95]Move on in.
[197:54.97]Fully furnished, I'll take it.
[198:00.21]Okay, we're gonna take it slow.
[198:03.17]I am going to have two bedrooms with three people.
[198:06.45]Yeah, that's fine.
[198:10.71]Alright, here we go.
[198:13.19]Game starts now.
[198:18.76]That is such a tiny dog.
[198:21.08]What's wrong?
[198:24.20]Acquired the comedy skill.
[198:25.32]Didn't even have to do anything.
[198:27.59]We all go right for the TV.
[198:31.64]Get off the table!
[198:32.38]Get off the table!
[198:33.92]I forgot, we all went immediately to the TV.
[198:42.58]So let's do my perspective.
[198:44.86]You're watching Think America's Got Talent.
[198:52.10]Quick, run him over.
[198:54.10]I'm not gonna do... No.
[198:55.58]Why does it say first to die?
[198:56.66]Oh, that's the person's name.
[198:59.78]He still has it.
[199:03.50]Let's interact.
[199:05.10]Play with the laser pointer with the cat.
[199:10.42]No, I'm not killing anybody yet.
[199:14.85]Go get it!
[199:18.41]That rat just doesn't shut up, huh?
[199:23.93]No, no car joke.
[199:25.07]I'm not doing that yet.
[199:26.37]We can't just go to a thousand.
[199:31.83]Let's see.
[199:34.06]What else can I do?
[199:34.70]What else can I do with the cat?
[199:39.06]Pick up.
[199:40.78]You can pick up the cat.
[199:41.58]I can pick him up?
[199:45.85]How do I...
[199:52.52]Get out.
[199:52.90]I guess I can just do the shift tab and do this.
[199:56.16]Alright, let's see.
[200:00.77]You can actually pick the cats up.
[200:02.13]I didn't even know that.
[200:02.71]Guys.
[200:04.19]I can stalk the cat.
[200:23.64]Why would I do that?
[200:24.30]I'm not going to do that.
[200:26.16]Here's the thing, though.
[200:28.85]I can use... I can move around with the animals.
[200:43.16]Remember this?
[200:46.04]I'm going to be nice to the cat.
[200:46.90]Look, I'm holding the cat.
[200:47.88]No.
[200:48.26]Okay, now I just got picked up.
[200:52.28]More choices.
[200:52.84]We got drugs.
[200:56.76]Not doing these yet.
[200:59.56]But I can't control the animals.
[201:03.96]Yeah, I get a spot right on the sofa.
[201:06.76]Oh, also, we can't go right into this yet, but any object of the whole game can be worn as a hat.
[201:14.08]Just throwing that out there.
[201:15.62]Just in case anybody was wondering.
[201:24.39]Let's see here.
[201:25.47]What is in here?
[201:25.89]Alright.
[201:28.27]Can we do something as a group?
[201:31.88]What do I want to do for... What do I want to actually do with the characters?
[201:39.42]I've got to make a decision here.
[201:42.78]Pet obsessions.
[201:43.94]Oh, here we go, here we go.
[201:45.65]Do they like cats?
[201:57.67]Welcome to the neighborhood.
[201:58.97]The cat is about to greet them.
[202:10.58]Is that it?
[202:27.34]No, no, who is this lady?
[202:32.27]Whoa!
[202:35.63]Ah, sorry, my little shit cat.
[202:37.17]My cat's an asshole.
[202:38.07]Hold on.
[202:40.25]Come on in!
[202:40.93]Let's have some fun.
[202:41.71]Come on in.
[202:42.85]Both of you.
[202:47.23]They're relatively normal.
[202:50.54]Sort of.
[202:53.46]What do you have in your hand?
[202:55.62]Oh, I forgot.
[202:56.22]You like reading.
[203:00.52]Can somebody get the door?
[203:03.64]Somebody get the door.
[203:04.28]You're just watching TV together.
[203:05.75]Stop.
[203:08.83]She does look like a fish.
[203:16.33]Oh, you like red cars, do you?
[203:21.09]Uh-oh.
[203:23.39]It's funny you say that you like red cars.

[266:30.52]What?
[266:39.30]Well, that's funny.
[266:40.76]Because it's impossible for there to be world peace.
[266:45.33]Because I still have the decisions to make here.
[266:48.33]What does that do?
[266:52.15]Wish for romance.

[272:50.08]What are you doing?
[273:01.59]No, this is the problem.

[293:58.57]No, stop.
[294:03.22]Anybody out here that...

[294:31.39]Just want his name.
[294:33.33]Okay, here we go.
[294:37.35]Chat.
[294:39.61]Go over there.
[294:42.46]Ugh, what are you doing?
[294:47.65]Don't give me money and run!
[294:49.03]Oh my god, you fucking little asshole.
[294:51.95]Wait!
[294:53.27]Wait!
[295:00.48]Fuck you then!
[295:13.50]I don't even know who these people are.
[295:22.93]He got away.
[295:23.97]Where was I ever going to find him again?
[295:25.27]I let the treasure goblin get away.
[295:34.03]I'm not killing this person anymore.
[295:39.00]Alright, it's time for you to cut the shit and have a part.
[295:42.28]Did I meet anybody?
[295:42.94]I need to see if I chat with... I did.
[295:49.43]There you go.
[295:49.91]I met one person.
[295:56.59]I need to make friends.
[296:03.76]What are you doing here?
[296:08.10]Why is death here?
[296:12.47]That just made him gain some weight.
[296:25.22]Bark at.
[297:17.49]Okay, so... Something we need to remember here is somebody... That was fucking weird.
[297:25.24]The girl was killed in here.
[297:30.12]Let's just keep moving here.
[297:31.22]Can I move?
[297:32.66]No, not with him.
[297:35.13]At least you're having fun.
[297:36.23]Can somebody clean this up?
[297:45.25]Okay, so who... You guys... Both of you two are still alive, so that's good.
[297:50.12]I'm okay with this.
[297:53.44]Death killed somebody.
[297:54.46]No, no, no, no.
[297:55.12]I'm...
[298:03.32]Um... What are you doing with that gun?
[298:10.46]Who is this?
[298:14.21]He was going to shoot me and then he realized how bad I smelled and his AI fucked up.
[298:20.43]Whoa!
[298:34.72]Gotta get in front of it.
[298:51.65]Can I go home now?
[298:57.03]He smells something.
[298:57.91]He thought I was already dead, yeah.
[299:02.70]Why am I still dressed like this?
[299:04.00]Why am I still doing this?
[299:09.84]Why are people glowing?
[299:10.68]Because I enabled world peace from the genie.
[299:13.51]I'm not even sure the genie exists anymore.
[299:16.17]Did somebody free the genie?
[299:26.84]World peace sure did work.
[299:38.09]Alright, get out of here.
[299:38.91]Home.
[299:41.89]Stop dancing and go home.
[299:43.77]How do I leave the gang?
[299:44.94]You just can't get over it, can you?
[299:54.66]You did a great job upholding the world peace.
[299:56.14]I... I'm gonna be honest with you.
[300:02.55]I didn't mean to do anything.
[300:03.39]They just... I did like the gang fight.
[300:10.42]You can't actually do this, can you?
[300:23.32]What are you doing out here?
[300:24.22]Why does everybody keep leaving the house?
[300:31.84]I need to know what you're doing out here.
[300:32.99]Let's follow you.
[300:40.17]And?
[300:40.31]What are you doing?
[300:45.71]Is it the person that's walking towards me?
[300:47.27]That was a huge strike of lightning.
[300:59.30]I'm gonna sit here and watch him.
[301:02.28]This is kind of concerning.
[301:06.82]You know the umbrella is supposed to stay up.
[301:14.81]That's the banana.
[301:17.14]We're getting a crossover episode here.
[301:42.66]I came all the way over here just to do that.
[301:48.85]I don't like this.
[301:49.51]And now he's very sad.
[302:06.99]Very sad.
[302:07.73]What's your problem?
[302:10.18]Social?
[302:11.02]Meet some friends.
[302:11.56]I need to have a party.
[302:13.90]Wait.
[302:16.47]Um... I apparently punched this guy in the face.
[302:23.80]What?
[302:37.27]I walked over, punched him in the face, and then fell asleep on the, uh, bench, apparently.
[302:42.97]But why wouldn't you just go to bed?
[302:47.44]What?!
[302:52.42]Why?
[302:52.80]Eight is running away?!
[303:00.99]Hold on, who's running away?
[303:02.55]Eight is running away?! !
[303:05.88]Posting an alert via computer or phone can help find... What do you mean find her?
[303:10.58]Where... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[303:18.20]Don't leave.
[303:22.99]No, no, no, no, no.
[303:27.43]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[303:28.41]You, you're out here.
[303:29.61]Go get her.
[303:31.03]Right now.
[303:31.81]Stop what you're doing.
[303:36.46]Where's the fucking cat?

[303:59.82]How do I run?
[304:05.87]Run, run, run!
[304:09.86]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[304:10.68]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[304:11.40]Go over here.
[304:15.32]Over here.
[304:17.30]No, sit here.

[306:06.35]Don't you dare.
[306:16.03]Why would you yell at the cat?
[306:18.88]What are you doing?
[306:19.78]It's so bad!
[306:22.00]What the hell is wrong with you?
[306:32.81]Rumor is mean.
[306:33.85]Mean Sims become happy when they say mean things to other Sims.
[306:39.96]What's wrong?
[306:46.66]Okay.
[306:54.09]Comfort.

[311:57.03]Sign Aiden for curing... Sign Aiden for a spay.
[312:02.17]Death is hitting on somebody over there.
[312:13.25]He's gonna do it again.
[312:14.37]No, I'm gonna prevent that from happening.
[312:16.15]A vet will be with you soon to examine and treat your sick pet.
[312:20.06]Please be patient.
[312:26.47]So where's... Get pet examined?

[312:48.26]Really?
[312:49.04]Are you serious?
[312:58.37]Pet exam.
[313:04.43]It looks like 8 has woozy-kiddy-itis.
[313:07.59]Which option would you like to have?
[313:10.62]Expensive trip.
[313:11.34]Spare no expense and cure your pet with the best medicine available.
[313:15.52]I'm so used to seeing guns, man.
[313:22.18]Alright.

[313:45.60]What's going on?
[313:49.12]Sad music.
[313:53.27]That was kind of scary.
[313:57.72]You got one too, okay.

[314:00.16]Wait, Death just got arrested?
[314:07.78]Oh!
[314:19.21]I don't even know what that was.
[314:20.59]No!
[314:26.99]What about the kitty?
[314:32.39]No, stop.
[314:38.92]Stop, stop it.
[314:46.30]Gloomber Spinoia.
[314:50.27]The dog is just like, here.
[314:52.13]How do I get him out of jail?
[314:56.63]You're going to jump up and eat the treats?
[315:17.29]I can't.
[315:18.75]I can't.
[315:20.92]No, I can't.
[315:38.56]I have to stop that.
[315:39.54]I have to stop that.
[315:41.40]I have to stop that joke.
[315:42.48]It's not... We did it too many times.
[315:45.36]I've done that too many times.
[315:48.64]There are no more vets.
[315:53.93]Alright, alright.
[315:54.81]No, it's not funny anymore.
[315:56.15]I'm out.
[315:56.39]Get me out of here.
[315:57.07]Go home.
[316:04.47]Why is he taking a picture?
[316:07.44]Does the cat know how to go home?
[316:10.88]It's gonna arrest the cat.
[316:16.25]No, you can't arrest the cat.
[316:39.45]I need to get this cat back home.
[316:43.45]But nobody can- somebody's gonna pick the cat up.
[316:46.60]I'm in a different world right now.
[316:51.81]What's Jerma doing?
[316:52.77]I don't know, but at home.
[316:55.67]Okay, you need to come get this cat.
[317:00.35]Stop shooting!
[317:01.27]Oh, this is bad.
[317:03.32]Why am I... What was that?
[317:07.10]Am I my covenant blood?
[317:13.60]Is death gonna take my cat?
[317:19.10]Goddammit, I need to get you home.
[317:29.62]That's a bad idea.
[317:30.93]Don't attack death.
[317:32.77]Alright, go... Let's focus on... Switch control.
[317:44.02]I gotta pull that cat back.
[317:57.47]Alright, cat, call over.
[318:03.73]The cat brought two friends, I guess.
[318:07.85]Alright, invite over.
[318:11.71]Funny introduction, welcome to the house.
[318:16.70]It's time to have a party.
[318:19.44]How do I get you out of jail?
[318:23.40]How are you still at the hospital?
[318:37.29]Where is he?
[318:49.74]On the computer at the vets.
[318:55.58]We got two more vets.
[318:56.40]We're good.
[319:02.32]Cat is home.
[319:03.02]Everyone's home.
[319:03.62]Time for you to go home too.
[319:06.72]He's about to make a coffee again.
[319:13.83]Oh my god.
[319:19.17]No, just go.
[319:23.68]Just get out of here.

[321:44.05]Wait, what the hell is Tofurky?
[321:45.47]I have no clue.
[321:51.37]That's all you need to do.
[321:53.15]First to die is just kill somebody.
[321:56.97]What?
[321:57.49]Why?
[321:57.67]Why?
[322:14.80]Technically he was first to die He was out of control he was
[322:40.91]Fortress.
[322:43.11]Alright.
[322:46.15]Can I make a grand meal, please?
[322:51.10]Leffy!

[323:36.90]This really is.
[323:37.58]This is absolutely adorable.
[323:46.01]And what was the point of that?
[323:47.03]Did I add money?
[323:48.31]I think I put money in here.
[323:53.51]My secret ingredient is money.
[324:09.90]This is not a turkey.
[324:14.32]At all.
[324:15.41]This is a bowl of tomato paste.
[324:17.99]And that's it.
[324:23.25]It's tofu turkey.
[324:25.99]Really?
[324:26.27]Oh, what?
[324:30.95]Okay.
[324:36.68]You can turn the oven on?
[324:38.82]That's not how you turn an oven on.
[324:40.14]It is a notch on the top right.
[324:44.00]I just threw a lime in there.
[324:50.09]Turn on the oven.
[324:55.95]Uh... It is... It's already on.
[324:58.39]Okay.
[325:01.20]So it looks pretty good.
[325:07.12]Yeah, it does.
[325:10.02]Did somebody just throw a glass at me?
[325:12.96]What the fuck was that?

[355:10.77]Get out of here.
[355:11.57]Go away.
[355:11.79]Oh, wait, wait, hold on.

[356:07.55]Right, right, right.
[356:08.63]Okay.

[356:39.79]I can't- I can't-
[357:10.29]Where is he?
[357:12.39]Why is everybody freaking out about him?
[357:14.55]Wait.

[357:29.58]What's he doing?
[357:37.18]Why is everybody so pissed?
[357:50.66]Barry feels as if he is being pulled out of his body into another realm.
[357:54.71]A presence of a benevolent entity appears who telepathically communicates that she wishes to guide Barry around the astral place.
[358:07.65]Follow.
[358:13.63]What is your purpose?
[358:36.31]The old man's expression changes from kind smile to berating gaze.
[358:39.57]He speaks, My purpose has nothing to do with why you are here.
[358:43.06]This is a sacred place of self-realization.
[358:45.00]You're not ready.
[358:50.16]Oh.
[358:51.54]That's annoying.

[424:09.36]From mourning from losing a good friend.
[424:15.99]We took that way too seriously.

[429:20.92]Alright, let's have a... Let's cheer up.
[429:32.08]Try to cheer up.
[429:36.43]What's wrong?
[429:37.85]What just happened?
[429:39.49]Something unusual just happened to Penny out of nowhere.
[429:41.67]This will leave her scared for a couple of hours.
[430:01.50]Alright, let's go.
[430:04.08]What are some drugs?
[430:05.90]Just marijuana.
[430:07.42]Not a big deal.
[430:19.23]Game crashed and she cried about it.

[430:43.55]They're alright.
[430:43.99]How are you doing on food?
[430:45.93]You're doing fine.
[430:52.03]This dawn of this last day.
[430:58.72]Pregnancy speedrun.
[431:01.58]It's getting late.
[431:06.66]It's almost 2 AM Eastern.
[431:12.05]As much as it is fun dicking around.
[431:13.85]22 hours.
[431:19.93]Remove the urn.
[431:23.18]I can't even move it.
[431:24.04]I can't get rid of it.
[431:24.62]Just put it in your inventory.
[431:37.95]Put the urn on as a hat.
[431:42.54]The chaos book?
[431:43.50]No, not yet.
[431:44.30]I need to see the pregnancy.
[431:45.42]I've never seen it before.
[431:57.28]You're in Nevada?
[431:58.84]Yeah, I'm talking about for everybody else.
[432:00.63]It's almost 11 p.m.
[432:01.51]for me right now.
[432:02.45]But that means that it's almost 2 for a bunch of people that are in America and forget about EU right now.
[432:16.21]Alright, getting there.
[432:17.71]18 hours.
[432:19.47]How do you have a baby delivered?
[432:22.83]Throw this thing in the trash, please.
[432:30.86]Do I have to have, like, the hospital people, the doctor have to come out?
[432:36.46]Do I have to go to the hospital?
[432:37.60]What's he calling me?
[432:45.02]Let's go down to the karaoke bar and sing some duets.
[432:47.02]I've been practicing like crazy.
[432:51.06]I was trying to say yes!
[432:55.92]Never mind.
[433:05.14]Baby's all I care about.
[433:06.02]Let's go.
[433:11.97]Put a microwave on head and make food.
[433:21.04]Am I gonna vaccinate the kid?
[433:28.30]Oh.
[433:30.02]Alright.
[433:36.35]Are you gonna... What?
[433:37.94]What's wrong?
[433:41.46]Morning sickness.
[433:45.08]And... sore back.
[433:49.04]You're almost through it.
[433:50.24]It's almost over.
[433:58.38]Anti-vaxxing is not politics.
[434:01.36]No, I'm gonna vaccinate my goddamn baby.
[434:15.48]12 out.
[434:15.90]Who's here?
[434:17.56]That's me.
[434:18.03]This cake has lasted a long time.
[434:42.95]What happened to his banana costume?
[434:47.25]My immersion.
[434:48.01]It's now fall.
[434:49.15]Prank day.
[434:59.62]I'm not going to go prank day.
[435:04.48]End the holiday early.
[435:05.34]Is it the next day?
[435:15.50]Almost!
[435:20.24]Prank day canceled.
[435:22.26]All that matters is getting this baby out and away from this house.
[435:36.20]WarStream, you ended prank day.
[435:39.08]We already did prank day like eight hours ago.
[435:45.55]What's going on?
[435:48.35]Oh, she's puking.
[435:57.72]Back to the computer.
[435:58.40]What else can we do?
[436:04.24]Practice programming.
[436:10.16]How fresh.
[436:10.82]You know what I've noticed?
[436:14.95]Is anybody left?
[436:17.57]I think we're the final... Is anybody left?
[436:26.58]The gnome is left.
[436:27.28]Can I... How do I... I wanna... I'm just gonna bring the gnome over here.
[436:33.92]Give me a second.
[436:41.09]I'm gonna age the baby up when the baby gets here, and let's see if it's just the dad again.
[436:45.49]Let's see if we get Peter back.
[436:46.75]Reincarnation through pregnancy.
[437:14.97]Nothing like a pregnant woman buying illegal drugs.
[437:20.17]How do I get him over here?
[437:21.35]I need to call him, right?
[437:26.37]Invite... How do I get you over here?
[437:35.36]Can I explain why there's a ghost in the house?
[437:37.64]Well, it's a genie.
[437:38.64]A genie came out and started to socialize with everybody, granted a couple of the world peace wishes.
[437:47.71]That genie then fell in love with somebody in the house.
[437:53.75]And then that person that she fell in love with during a Sims murder party died.
[438:01.66]I've never met the gnomes, so I can't invite them over.
[438:09.75]Really?
[438:10.01]God damn it.
[438:14.23]Oh, and then he, like, punched her in the face, so I ran him over with a car.
[438:26.68]Alright, let's go.
[438:29.06]Actually, you know what?
[438:29.60]Let's save it here.
[438:30.82]And I'm gonna go to the gnome's house.
[438:41.78]Let's head to the gnome's house.
[438:44.30]They'll be fine for a little while.
[438:49.75]I need to get back to home worlds.
[438:52.31]No, no, no, no.
[438:54.15]Cancel this travel.
[438:54.93]I have to just exit.
[438:57.65]Manage worlds.
[439:09.45]Let's take a look.
[439:10.45]It's been a long time since we've even looked over here.
[439:12.91]We saw what was going on here.
[439:26.38]Alright.
[439:27.80]So.
[439:29.54]How we doing?
[439:31.18]Intro for it.
[439:31.82]I don't think the gnome has left his house.
[439:37.60]Uncomfortable.
[439:41.77]I need you to go and visit.
[439:45.29]I want you to go visit somebody.
[439:50.92]Nobody else knows who I am.
[439:56.80]Stuck in the suit?
[439:57.66]Yeah, he doesn't come out.
[440:00.34]Is there a way I can just go?
[440:03.44]Visit the carrot?
[440:04.10]Wait a minute.
[440:06.36]What are they picketing out here?
[440:12.61]What's going on here?
[440:28.45]What does it say?
[440:28.99]What does it say?
[440:45.87]What is it?
[440:48.39]I don't know.
[440:49.64]Is it about the police?
[440:52.42]About scales?

[443:02.46]You took the trash out now.

[443:28.88]Why would you do that?
[443:29.96]I better not do that too.
[443:31.87]I don't know what to do.
[443:45.24]Alright, that lady was fucked.

[466:07.42]Okay.

[466:56.62]Where are we going?
[467:09.01]Click on her.
[467:09.63]That's what I just did.
[467:10.91]Alright, click on her.
[467:11.71]Go home.
[467:29.66]She's not in labor yet.
[467:30.62]Yeah, I can't go to the hospital right now.
[467:38.67]Click on the actual genie.
[467:39.95]This is her.
[467:43.19]She's going home.
[467:49.19]Uh.
[467:57.45]Click on the lamp to have the baby.
[467:58.89]No, that's not how it works.
[468:01.56]You need to wait until you get the labor passive.
[468:05.46]Yeah, so what are you guys talking about?
[468:06.82]I have to go into labor first.
[468:13.08]I can't do anything about this.
[468:16.55]What, are you just going to jubate me?
[468:17.65]Alright, I'll be ready.
[468:21.75]Buy bassinet from the store.
[468:28.24]What do I like?
[468:28.78]Baby.
[468:43.50]Is it even here?
[468:44.08]The crib doesn't work either.
[468:59.21]Bedroom?
[469:02.13]I have to buy a crib or the baby will not come.
[469:05.21]Okay.
[469:09.24]Wait.
[469:18.40]Is that good enough?
[469:23.67]That's not a crib.
[469:25.07]There is no crib.
[469:54.86]Where is this crib you're talking about?
[470:00.58]I'm in the kids menu.
[470:02.40]I'm in the kids menu right now.
[470:07.84]You guys are just fucking with me.
[470:09.02]Alright, whatever.
[470:09.64]Let's go.
[470:15.72]There is no crib.
[470:16.72]You don't have to have a crib.
[470:18.60]I'll put the school desk over here.
[470:31.31]Just sleep in this bed.
[470:38.41]Get that baby out.
[470:47.48]Today, uh... The crib comes with the baby.
[470:52.76]I knew it.
[470:54.50]A bunch of liars here.
[471:13.06]God damn it.
[471:14.16]I need to eat.
[471:18.41]Penny's off to- Penny got a job?
[471:46.06]Put a bassinet in your home and you'll have the option to give birth or give birth at the hospital.
[471:51.36]We just looked but it doesn't exist.
[472:04.27]This thing is called the Rockabye Bassinet.
[472:10.74]Oh my god.
[472:18.32]Rock-a-bye.
[472:19.96]I couldn't do BA.
[472:22.96]Alright, let's go.
[472:23.66]Let's get this over with.
[472:24.50]It's been a long stream.
[472:27.02]It's been a long day.
[472:29.41]Let's get this fucking baby out.
[472:59.57]Oh, you could cook.
[473:01.21]Good.
[473:03.35]Still waiting for it.
[473:15.64]Well, I actually just typed it and looked it up.
[473:24.35]Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[473:27.41]No, god damn it.
[473:35.75]Where is it?
[473:36.37]What's at work?
[473:39.99]Where's the gnome?
[473:42.29]Alright, come on.
[473:54.74]Hurry up.
[474:02.14]It's so late.
[474:04.27]It's almost 3 AM Eastern right now.
[474:07.43]We can't go to bed until this happens.
[474:09.23]Just give it a minute.
[474:37.66]What a day of work.
[474:38.42]Penny came home and made a... I thought that just said $1.12.
[474:41.54]I was like, what the hell did you do for work?
[474:44.48]Alright, get up.
[474:53.99]Uh... Is he gonna leave that like that?
[474:58.19]Really?
[475:09.55]Fix that, you dickhead.
[475:12.68]Oh, she's out of jail.
[475:18.08]I don't know how she's alive.
[475:24.08]This lady sucks.
[475:27.47]I took her wig.
[475:41.52]What the fuck?
[475:45.62]I'm gonna lose my mind.
[475:46.94]I'm gonna lose my mind.
[475:49.74]I hate this, but I love it at the same time.
[476:07.89]Did you, are you gonna, okay, did you, there's no more hair for you to take out.
[476:11.77]Why do you hate this girl so much?
[476:17.10]What did she do to you?
[476:26.20]Where'd she go?
[476:26.74]Alright, well, whatever.
[476:30.11]I don't know why they hate each other so much.
[476:40.28]Okay.
[476:56.68]Enjoy your coffee.
[476:58.88]I'm just waiting for this stupid baby to come up.
[477:05.23]Hey!
[477:05.59]Hey!
[477:05.95]Hey!
[477:06.37]Hey!
[477:06.99]Here we go!
[477:07.35]Here we go!
[477:07.63]Here we go!
[477:08.42]Alright, what do we do?
[477:09.06]What do we do?
[477:10.78]Going into labor.
[477:11.64]We gotta bring everybody to the hospital.
[477:13.52]Wait, invite the gnome over, quick!
[477:15.46]Call the gnome!
[477:16.12]Call the gnome!
[477:16.80]Call the gnome!
[477:17.90]Call the gnome!
[477:23.42]No, you don't know the gnome!
[477:25.79]Call the gnome!
[477:31.59]Quick!
[477:31.81]Quick!
[477:38.07]Okay, get up, everybody.
[477:39.25]Hospital, let's go.
[477:40.03]Alright, the gnome's here.
[477:49.07]Half-baby.
[477:53.97]This is the moment of truth.
[477:54.69]We've been waiting for this for like three hours.
[477:56.41]Here we go.
[477:58.39]Wait, you just drop it in here.
[478:12.90]Uh... Congratulations, it's a boy.
[478:19.51]I just gave birth to a baby boy.
[478:21.55]This baby needs a name!
[478:22.51]Boo!
[478:39.56]Thank you.
[479:26.63]That's... That's fucking ridiculous.
[479:35.34]What is that noise?
[479:37.98]Ugh.
[479:59.61]Alright, it's time for the baby to grow up.
[480:08.98]No, you get away from that baby!
[480:11.88]Get away from that baby!
[480:13.20]Get away from the baby!
[480:15.44]Get away!
[480:17.62]Get the fuck away from that baby!
[480:19.68]Get out of here!
[480:21.49]You motherfucker!
[480:22.87]No!
[480:23.35]Don't touch that baby!
[480:27.25]Somebody help!
[480:29.68]No, neither.
[480:30.24]You either.
[480:30.94]You go back over here.
[480:39.72]Get over the baby.
[480:40.96]Stop doing... What just happened?
[480:49.07]Okay, get over... Get over here.
[480:53.75]Somebody pick up the baby.
[480:56.39]Somebody pick up the baby.
[481:02.01]Okay, thank you.
[481:03.42]I wasn't going to let that motherfucker get near this baby.
[481:21.49]Why is the gnome here?
[481:22.99]Oh yeah, I invited the gnome over.
[481:24.59]Alright, I'm done.
[481:27.33]I'm done.
[481:27.65]I'm going to bed.
[481:30.33]I can't fucking handle this anymore.
[481:36.77]I'm gonna age the baby.
[481:38.50]You- Alright.
[481:42.28]Show age up.
[481:43.86]Here we go.
[481:45.70]Let's see.
[481:48.04]Who you grow- No wait, did I just do that to her?
[481:50.88]Who did I just do that to?

[482:36.88]Oh no!
[482:38.28]No, the gnome is fine.
[482:39.50]The gnome is gonna be just fine.
[482:42.94]I trust the gnome.
[482:44.96]That's weird for me to say that.
[482:46.18]Excuse me.
[482:46.78]Huh?
[482:50.29]Oh, I thought you just cast a magic spell.
[482:56.53]Toddler's day spent playing with toys, exploring the world, and learning to communicate with words instead of tears.
[483:01.53]Oh wait, this is the perfect time to start skill building.
[483:05.93]Okay.
[483:08.61]Uh... Inquisitive.
[483:15.92]Uh... This is such a fucked up household.
[483:24.31]Alright.
[483:28.69]Here we go.
[483:30.49]How... I need to... I want to age... Age up.
[483:35.45]Age up.
[483:41.22]Did age up work?
[483:45.98]Okay.
[483:46.84]Peter aged up.
[483:48.00]Aspirations.
[483:48.92]Alright.
[483:49.76]Creativity.
[483:50.85]That sounds good to me.
[483:53.39]And, you know, cheerful.
[483:55.75]That sounds pretty good.
[483:56.55]Okay.
[484:06.45]Uh, no, no.
[484:09.58]Creativity, no.
[484:14.36]A botanist.
[484:15.66]Sure.
[484:18.18]And a romantic.
[484:19.26]Come on.
[484:23.12]Actually, dude.
[484:26.94]What a fucking insane childhood you have.
[484:31.47]You're just crying.
[484:33.43]You have the mental... You have the brain of a one-day-old.
[484:39.83]How did you... You already got your phone?
[484:43.67]Alright.
[485:12.23]Okay, I've lost my mind.
[485:13.46]I gotta get out of here.
[485:15.10]Hey, we watched him grow up.
[485:27.17]I'm never doing this again.
[485:28.33]Ugh.
[485:30.23]Ugh.
[485:41.99]Someone just said, you're a mean person.
[485:52.28]That didn't take eight hours.
[485:53.76]I'll bring him back.
[485:57.02]I'll bring him back.
[485:58.84]Just wait.
[485:59.48]I'll bring him back, everybody.
[486:01.40]Settle down.
[486:02.04]Bleed for Peter.
[486:05.94]Oh.
[486:16.16]And it has been accepted.
[486:17.48]What?
[486:22.08]What's the cheat for it?
[486:24.88]How do I cheat?
[486:26.10]How do I bring him back?
[486:32.81]What's the cheat for it?
[486:40.59]there is no cheat for it
[487:07.33]That was so uncalled for.
[487:15.34]At least he got to get to like 32, you know?
[487:20.19]He went from an infant to like 40.
[487:35.32]32 seconds.
[487:35.94]Finish the fight!
[487:36.84]There is no fight!
[487:37.82]No.
[487:39.06]This is a gnome stream, though.
[488:14.74]I got a fucking headache.
[488:19.29]What a joke.
[488:27.13]Man, I need a cup of coffee after that one.
[488:31.90]He lived until 32 in a bathroom.
[488:44.36]Alright.
[488:57.70]Let me just seriously applaud The Sims 4 modding community.
[489:07.83]What a hell of a job.
[489:10.75]How much outrage is shit?
[489:12.05]I can't even believe this stuff is even in the game.
[489:16.71]Did it once before.
[489:18.59]Did it again.
[489:19.31]And there's still somehow interesting things to look at.
[489:22.29]Oh, man.
[489:28.07]My eyes are itchy.
[489:31.97]Alright, I think that's gonna be it.
[489:33.47]Here are your... Here's who's left standing.
[489:38.36]The genie.
[489:41.12]I don't even know who this is.
[489:44.81]Detective, whatever.
[489:47.23]I don't know who this is.
[489:54.45]I didn't make this lady, did I?
[489:55.65]Oh, it's a caterer.
[489:58.02]I evicted this lady eight, nine hours ago, and then I brought them back as a caterer, and then made them part of the family.
[490:05.68]No one, here's an interesting...
[490:09.06]Piece of information here.
[490:10.62]Nobody here is from any original family.
[490:14.28]The gnome was not supposed to be part of any family.
[490:18.97]Everybody's gone.
[490:20.91]The gnome was just a drug dealer.
[490:30.79]Now, thank you for joining me in the nine-hour car joke.
[490:35.47]With some other random stuff sprinkled in.
[490:39.35]What the hell is this?
[491:00.74]What the fuck are you doing?
[491:04.80]Is that Peter?
[491:07.01]No, it's not.
[491:14.31]That's not Peter.
[491:14.85]That's some random person that died here like six days ago.
[491:28.38]There's another person here!
[491:29.58]Who's this?
[491:36.34]Who is this person?
[491:38.91]He's gonna drink out of a dirty cup?
[491:41.83]Where are you going?
[492:07.33]Scared by ghost.
[492:10.29]Oh, I thought he was scared by the ghost.
[492:15.01]Oh, I get it.
[492:15.54]They come and they haunt you.
[492:32.98]I'm so confused right now.
[492:39.93]Do not wake up from that.
[492:41.41]It just turned him green.
[492:50.16]Take the soul.
[492:57.66]Age down the ghost.
[492:59.31]Age down the ghost.
[493:00.25]What do you mean age down?
[493:01.07]Age down until what?
[493:06.61]You're about to use the computer?
[493:12.99]What the fuck are you two doing here?
[493:16.45]I have no clue.
[493:17.81]He's picking up the demon evil book.
[493:32.27]That's... okay, that's not good.
[493:35.95]That's all he wanted to see, he's getting a spell.
[493:38.37]Yeah, how's this for a spell?
[493:49.61]Did it work?
[493:50.03]I don't think you can do it.
[494:05.12]At least you're cleaning up after yourself.
[494:06.62]That's nice of you.
[494:12.39]I don't think it can work.
[494:13.63]Nah, you can't do it to, uh... To ghosts, I don't think.
[494:16.71]Alright, somebody needs to get up.
[494:25.63]Get up and, uh... Let me try to... One last thing.
[494:29.83]Where's the book?
[494:30.35]What, did he put it away?
[494:32.53]Book of Chaos.
[494:33.49]Put it down in the world over here.
[494:37.18]Let's get these evil spirits out of here.
[494:38.66]Alright, where'd you put it?
[494:44.20]I'm not in the trash.
[494:45.80]Alright, uh, free, read, put it, ask to be partners in crime.
[494:48.62]Burn Sim.
[494:50.14]Drown Sim and pee.
[495:00.77]Where are they?
[495:14.32]Can I make the ghost streak?
[495:18.48]Who is this?
[495:18.90]Um... Naked ghost is more clothes.
[495:36.16]Okay, bye.
[495:47.30]We also have embarrass a Sim to death.
[495:51.67]I want it to drown!
[496:20.44]He's still alive.
[496:23.46]He's still alive.
[496:23.96]He's still alive.
[496:24.30]He's not dead yet.
[496:25.00]He's not dead.
[496:25.94]I got it.
[496:26.34]I'm good.
[496:32.08]He's still alive.
[496:32.56]I caught it right at the end.
[496:37.27]I didn't save the game either.
[496:38.25]I saved it before that.
[496:39.77]Like 30, 40 minutes ago.
[496:42.93]Show us proof that he's still alive?
[496:44.09]Sure.
[497:05.27]Well, that was as chaotic as I thought it was gonna be.
[497:19.98]That was a perfect opportunity to gnome chat.
[497:21.85]My brain can't think that far.
[497:23.49]It's been eight plus hours of this.
[497:26.71]Just constant, just total, absolute bullshit.
[497:34.54]Oh my god.
[497:40.29]Thank you all so much.
[497:41.11]That was the part two of The Sims 4.
[497:46.21]Hell.
[497:50.58]I thought that was hilarious.
[497:52.66]You know, maybe too many car jokes, but you know what happens.
[497:59.13]Can't wait for part three.
[498:00.95]We'll have to see about that.
[498:04.87]Sorry we went really late.
[498:06.11]I know a lot of people couldn't stick around.
[498:07.35]Because it is very, very, very late.
[498:13.49]So, I know a lot of you had to leave.
[498:18.45]But I will see you guys again.
[498:20.05]I don't know necessarily... I might be streaming... I'm not streaming tomorrow or today, technically, for a lot of you guys.
[498:30.15]Because I have a doctor's appointment on Friday, so today.
[498:35.45]Saturday... I'm trying to think what's going on.
[498:37.13]I think I have something I have to do on Saturday.
[498:41.12]I know I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[498:44.88]We'll see.
[498:45.16]I'll let you know.
[498:45.84]I'll let you know.
[498:46.44]I'll make a tweet, or I'll be in the Discord.
[498:50.90]The next stream, I'm going to maybe try to set up the next stream to be the PogoStick Gamer Challenge with Joel.
[499:02.32]So we'll see if I can get that at some point this weekend.
[499:07.03]Check his schedule.
[499:16.48]Don't accidentally go to the vet instead of the doctor.
[499:20.00]I will try.
[499:24.15]But that is a long... Long stream of The Sims 4.
[499:32.21]That didn't feel like very long to me at all.
[499:34.95]The first three hours of that though, or two hours or so, was making people.
[499:41.28]But I'll get in touch with Joel.
[499:44.33]Let's go to the bits.
[499:45.95]We've got about... Not very many, I don't think.
[499:49.87]I don't think there's a whole lot of bits to go through.
[499:59.71]Wait, as in Vinesauce Joel?
[500:01.05]Yeah.
[500:02.17]We're going to be doing a little co-op stream over the next few days.
[500:04.99]I'll let you know.
[500:09.80]But going all the way back to making Mr. Kasadan for the 250.
[500:16.62]Can we listen to this next time you do Picross?
[500:20.49]Uh, what is it?
[500:21.91]Let's see.
[500:25.13]This is called Become a Gorilla Fast.
[500:31.18]Pre-experience subliminal frequency hypnosis.
[500:34.32]I ain't gonna listen to that.
[500:37.56]That's like, that's freaking me out.
[500:39.54]Just the name.
[500:46.18]It's like a brown noise.
[500:49.19]But thank you.
[500:51.25]Uh, thank you to...
[500:55.26]Robot Joan for the $2.54.
[500:56.56]Hey Jerma, just wanted to let you know, I wanted to know how your day is.
[501:01.76]You don't need to ask me as I am a robot boy.
[501:03.95]Also, Garfield, that challenge is happening since my cartoon is better.
[501:08.21]Also, I have a giant bulb head.
[501:12.45]Getting a cartoon throwdown here.
[501:17.23]Somehow.
[501:20.16]Thank you, Robot Joan, for the $2.50.
[501:21.14]Appreciate it.
[501:25.95]Thank you, Zach, for the $4.
[501:27.13]Did it just say show love?
[501:29.64]Thank you.
[501:31.64]Trust No One.
[501:33.95]Thank you, Trust No One, for the $2.50.
[501:36.92]Hello, Jerma.
[501:37.48]You are back from the virtual world.
[501:38.87]Your VR experience was something.
[501:40.93]And how nice to see Star and you playing games together again.
[501:43.41]But to get Star back, you had to make him be in robe, wear a mask, speak into a voice morpher, watch stream from phone, crawl in the window, crawl through it during 30 minutes.
[501:53.02]Wow, anytime.
[501:54.38]It's movie time.
[501:55.94]Last time you, Mark, and Will tried your best at dad jokes.
[501:58.66]Those were not good.
[501:59.38]No, it's just playground insults.
[502:04.84]Hey, did you see the money that was in that draw?
[502:07.04]Alright, we got a, uh... Jeremy Elberton and Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg insult each other.
[502:17.68]Let's get it on screen.
[502:18.56]Let's take a look.
[502:33.20]Previously...
[502:34.46]Lazy boy!
[502:35.28]Santa!
[502:36.32]Yeah, this is the... I watched the one before this.
[502:44.61]This is another one.
[502:45.31]We're with Jerma and Mark Wahlberg about to play the playground insults game.
[502:50.85]It's good to see you again.
[502:51.65]I look like I'm made out of paper.
[502:54.23]I'm getting ready.
[502:56.45]You could call me a fucking dumb dickhead McGee and I wouldn't even care.
[502:59.25]I mean, I would.
[503:00.45]It might hurt my feelings a little bit, but don't do that.
[503:02.72]It would be mean.
[503:04.35]You're not a nice person.
[503:06.27]Easy now.
[503:07.13]Easy now.
[503:08.55]This guy sucks.
[503:10.13]Like, this guy sucks.
[503:12.47]Like, what a fucking loser.
[503:16.32]Your hair looks like a Brillo pad that I want to scrub my sack with.
[503:23.02]Why?
[503:23.34]The fuck?
[503:24.98]I thought he was going to jump on me.
[503:27.32]Your hair is like baby hair.
[503:30.10]You're a wonderfully looking human being.
[503:33.41]What are you doing?
[503:34.19]He's being sarcastic.
[503:35.35]Fucking swell boy.
[503:37.95]Your feet smell like weed.
[503:41.19]When did I ever say that?
[503:44.27]That's very kind of you, dude.
[503:46.13]You know, just fuck it.
[503:47.17]You are fucking tiny.
[503:48.31]That doesn't sound very original.
[503:51.27]Were you popular in high school?
[503:54.42]No.
[503:55.54]Remember I told you you could make me say anything you want?
[503:57.88]I will.
[504:01.78]Get ready.
[504:04.52]You smell like baby barf.
[504:08.43]You'll see.
[504:09.99]You'll see.
[504:11.21]You look 90.
[504:13.93]Your mama raised you well.
[504:19.39]You look like a James Bond villain.
[504:22.28]You wish you could scrub your sack with my Brillo head if you had a sack.
[504:28.98]You sackless bitch.
[504:31.26]If you think that aliens don't exist, oh boy, I've got some news for you.
[504:36.18]In your movies, I can see you, in your coverage, mouthing the line of the other actor silently to yourself.
[504:44.79]Don't say such a thing.
[504:45.65]It makes me feel bad.
[504:47.17]I'm an actor.
[504:47.97]You know what I mean?
[504:48.41]I'm a fucking actor.
[504:51.15]You're a terrible actor.
[504:53.70]Oh, great.
[504:54.24]Okay.
[504:55.42]You know that fucked up looking freak show character, The Joker?
[504:59.70]You look like the Joker without makeup on.
[505:05.12]You got a great ass for a guy from Boston.
[505:15.93]Next time.
[505:16.51]Let's see.
[505:16.91]What is it?
[505:17.29]Let's see.
[505:18.03]Hollywood celebrity shutting down reporters.
[505:21.63]Coming up next.
[505:26.51]Good luck.
[505:28.75]This is never going to end, is it?
[505:34.60]Shutting down reporters.
[505:39.10]Now, I told you guys this before, though.
[505:40.46]I've said 85% of every word in the human dictionary.
[505:44.56]You're talking about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and maybe even potentially thousands of hours on stream.
[505:53.36]and eight nine hundred videos I've said almost every word like at least 82 of every word humble brag thank you trust no one for that video it was great thank you hey divas thanks for the 250 divas
[506:23.81]Be where I live, thanks to the 250.
[506:25.39]Hey Jerry, I was just speeding around in my neighborhood outside of Vegas, but now I gotta rush home to catch your stream.
[506:31.29]Vroom.
[506:32.67]Oh, I didn't give a link.
[506:33.39]What am I, stupid?
[506:34.53]Here.
[506:35.31]Yeah, I am pretty dumb, aren't I?
[506:36.43]Yeah, VRJosh got it.
[506:39.59]That's the link right there.
[506:43.65]Thank you, VRJosh.
[506:44.15]Yeah, I'll do it again.
[506:49.83]Here, watch this.
[506:50.73]Now you got a double link.
[506:56.08]I think you'd be where I live.
[506:58.75]Thanks for driving around.
[507:05.47]I'm already in tears.
[507:07.89]Thank you for this.
[507:09.27]I think that's half the fun.
[507:12.23]For me, half the fun is not even getting in the game and having them do crazy shit.
[507:16.43]It's... making them in the first place.
[507:20.01]That's why I spend more than two or three hours just dicking around having fun, making like two or three different families.
[507:32.68]This is just one of those streams where it just happens in front of your face.
[507:35.48]You know what I mean?
[507:37.10]Sometimes... Oh, I wonder what... I wonder... Maybe I could come up with something funny.
[507:42.98]No.
[507:43.44]This should... I'm in the seat here watching it with you guys.
[507:52.42]Just... Whatever they decide to do.
[507:54.32]And however it happens.
[508:00.39]But thank you, mostlyloss, it means a lot.
[508:05.03]And again, mostlyloss, another 250.
[508:06.11]I love how you made Barry both self-assured and gloomy.
[508:24.00]Sometimes you just pick randomly, you know?
[508:26.56]There were five story arcs.
[508:28.02]The best story arc was absolutely the genie.
[508:33.09]I don't know, the cat running away was pretty ridiculous.
[508:38.93]I think the entire arc of the Genie was the best, though.
[508:41.79]From start to finish.
[508:42.50]That was the longest one.
[508:43.22]That took about, like, almost four hours of time.
[508:47.56]Going on a date with a banana?
[508:48.80]The Genie being in the game to begin with?
[508:52.80]The two gangs?
[508:53.60]I forgot about that.
[508:54.66]So much happened, it's just too much to even think about.
[508:57.04]And there had to be a car in every one of them.
[509:05.49]I like mod abused.
[509:08.49]That car joke.
[509:09.21]It's just so out of control.
[509:13.57]It's the most brutal.
[509:15.18]It's so fast.
[509:16.08]It hit the crib with the car.
[509:22.44]It was close.
[509:32.97]It's just the abruptness of the car.
[509:34.71]Yeah.
[509:42.78]But thank you.
[509:43.30]Appreciate it.
[509:49.95]Thank you, CommandoNam, for the $5, $6, $7, $8 here.
[509:52.99]More than that, $18, actually.
[510:01.13]Thank you so much.
[510:04.52]Failing my classes can cheer me up.
[510:07.98]Failing your classes.
[510:08.78]Well, here's what I'll tell you.
[510:14.09]Try to spend a little more time focusing on schoolwork.
[510:20.43]I know it can be a huge pain.
[510:25.57]Unfortunately, you know, you just gotta get it done.
[510:30.88]That's just the way it is.
[510:31.64]I had problems in school when I was in high school.
[510:34.90]But you just gotta get it done.
[510:36.50]You just gotta do it.
[510:39.40]Can't focus on school with 8 hour Sims 4 streams.
[510:44.77]You just gotta do your best.
[510:45.71]Do your best and maybe... Maybe disconnect a little bit from the computer.
[510:52.77]You know, you saw me throw away the computer in the trash.
[510:59.48]Put some music on.
[511:02.98]Relax.
[511:05.71]Grab like a tea or something, and just focus on doing some work.
[511:14.52]That's what I used to have to do.
[511:21.59]I work at a computer!
[511:22.79]Well, if you work- but I mean... That's true, I forgot.
[511:25.77]Like, I used to like, use like, paper.
[511:28.17]Everybody needs a computer now.
[511:30.03]Shit, this advice is bad.
[511:35.89]Hey, throw your computer in the trash.
[511:39.45]You know, the thing that you probably need to do your assignment on?
[511:44.46]Hey, you just gotta do your best.
[511:49.00]Do your best and just focus whenever you can get the opportunity to.
[511:54.08]It's really the best advice I can give.
[511:57.69]Everybody's a little different, though.
[512:00.87]Good luck.
[512:05.11]Mostly lost, thanks for the 250.
[512:06.59]I'm now fully convinced the Vroomer is a stream sniper.
[512:10.63]Me too.
[512:16.18]Freudian weapon, thanks for the 250.
[512:18.90]Happy Thursday.
[512:19.54]Happy Thursday to you as well.
[512:20.72]Well, now it's Friday.
[512:25.22]Now it's Friday.
[512:30.49]CommandoNam, thanks again for the 550 here.
[512:36.04]One of my assignments is biology.
[512:37.96]Can you help in biology?
[512:41.87]I didn't even take biology.
[512:45.39]I have no idea.
[512:48.19]I can't help you.
[512:50.24]All I know is biology has frogs and fish and... Yeah.
[512:55.66]organisms and I didn't really learn that much biology I think we didn't spend very much time on it in science class we spent maybe like two weeks on it I might be completely wrong I haven't been in high school in like 20 years it's been a long time I don't remember I can't even tell you I have no idea
[513:26.88]Have a good night, Kvas.
[513:28.70]See you again.
[513:29.62]Yeah, it's a late one.
[513:34.51]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[513:35.45]Hey, Jeremy, just wanted to say that these kinds of streams are my favorite, but I'm gonna miss most of it because I'm gonna go see a movie.
[513:42.09]Anyways, hope you have fun.
[513:42.85]And I can't wait to watch the VOD, and 90% of it is just character creation.
[513:46.65]And have a good night, Jerma, and chat.
[513:49.89]Close, close.
[513:50.59]Thank you, Peaceful Haley.
[513:52.67]Not quite, though.
[513:53.99]We got...
[513:55.94]eight hours and 35 minutes the first two hours and 30 minutes so it was about 30 35 or so just short of 90. but I appreciate it I love these streams too I love just watching you know what one of my favorite things in the world is watching ai be ai
[514:21.49]And watching people who are math problems come up with ways to do their internal math problem.
[514:36.80]It's just fun.
[514:42.16]Because you never know what they could possibly do.
[514:43.86]Sure, I'm like the orchestra.
[514:45.16]I have to... I've got the... The... Who's the guy that runs the concert?
[514:52.95]What's his name?
[514:53.45]He's the guy with the little stick in his hand.
[514:54.59]He's got the magic wand in his hand.
[514:56.27]The guy, he's like a magician, but he's not.
[514:57.51]He's like a conductor.
[515:00.73]I might be the conductor, but all the instruments are not run by me.
[515:04.09]It's just fun to watch them play.
[515:08.76]But thank you, though.
[515:09.22]Thank you, SuperSeal, for the $2.50.
[515:10.62]Can you enable the Vroom BTTV emote?
[515:17.96]I might have to.
[515:23.69]At this rate.
[515:24.17]That's all you guys hear.
[515:26.11]I only have five slots, though.
[515:30.49]I'm gonna have to delete something.
[515:34.44]What's gonna get the axe, I wonder?
[515:38.34]Hey, Space Cat!
[515:40.20]Thank you, Space Cat, for the five bucks.
[515:41.50]You make the most attractive Sims.
[515:45.51]I think that they're all beautiful, you know?
[515:52.57]Thank you.
[515:52.89]Mostly lost with 250.
[515:53.96]Let it be known that elephant feet is now permanently in your Google search history.
[516:00.24]Uh... So?
[516:08.38]I googled something way worse.
[516:11.66]Like an hour after that.
[516:19.44]I typed in, like, how to make a pregnancy happen in Sims or something, whatever it was.
[516:27.18]It was like, how do I force a baby out in Sims 4?
[516:30.95]I'm trying to, like, because somebody said you can, like, just click it.
[516:34.31]It was something like that.
[516:39.33]Yeah, that's way fucking worse.
[516:43.91]Than elephant feet.
[516:56.83]But thank you.
[516:59.83]We also had, uh, Most of Us Again 250.
[517:02.25]8 Lives is basically the cat from this video.
[517:06.15]Oh, I hope this ain't a cat.
[517:07.40]Something happened to a cat.
[517:10.88]Oh.
[517:11.70]I have seen this before.
[517:14.04]This is, uh, this is, hey, Michael Rappaport.
[517:16.60]I've seen this video.
[517:18.34]Ha ha ha.
[517:31.40]That is a classic video.
[517:36.40]But thank you, Most of the Lost, again, for your 250 again.
[517:40.02]Robot Jones, thanks for the free bucks again.
[517:41.60]Hey, I'm back.
[517:42.10]I wanted to see what your channel looked like back in 2011.
[517:44.14]So I used the Wayback Machine installed in my brain and I found this.
[517:48.79]Amazing.
[517:49.35]Jerma Channel.
[517:55.65]It started YouTube in 2011.
[517:56.51]2010, maybe.
[518:06.13]I was on other channels too.
[518:08.89]They were like... I'm trying to think of like other... There was other projects that I did on other people's channels long fucking time ago.
[518:19.66]They don't like exist anymore.
[518:20.72]I'm talking long, long time ago.
[518:31.17]When I think about how long I've been on the internet for...
[518:39.00]Just, oh, I like, I'm gonna make videos, or, like, you'll get to Newgrounds.
[518:43.56]I'm talking, like, 2004.
[518:45.40]2003, 2004.
[518:45.44]That's a long goddamn time ago.
[518:50.26]Now, how do you think I know Blordell?
[519:07.79]Me and Blordell met on Newgrounds.
[519:09.35]Like 14 years ago.
[519:11.85]Something like that.
[519:12.69]15 years ago.
[519:19.25]Might even be longer than that.
[519:37.58]Newgrounds are old.
[519:39.08]What happened to Newgrounds?
[519:46.47]Is it still there?
[519:47.07]Is it still working?
[519:48.25]Is it still owned by the Phulps?
[519:58.27]Does Tom Phulps still own that website?
[520:04.68]Yeah, wow.
[520:05.02]Talking about someone who's been around for a long time.
[520:10.82]That's a very long time ago.
[520:21.40]But thank you for the trip down memory lane, Robot Jones.
[520:23.50]Appreciate it.
[520:31.02]Tumblr banned porn so they migrated there.
[520:38.92]That's a very long time ago.
[520:42.18]Well, not that, but Newgrounds in general.
[520:52.58]Sleep tight.
[520:56.27]Uh, what else we got here?
[520:56.97]We have... Uh, Tingey!
[520:59.71]Thanks for the 250.
[521:01.13]Nice twerking.
[521:01.85]Takes some money.
[521:08.45]I forgot what happened five hours ago.
[521:11.85]Thank you, MostlyLostForThe250.
[521:13.31]What's your price for twerking on stream?
[521:15.85]Zero.
[521:17.50]Zero, zero, zero, zero.
[521:25.06]Free twerking.
[521:30.93]It's like hitting me like a ton of bricks right now that I'm just exhausted.
[521:39.48]I'm coming down right now after that.
[521:50.83]Past the old man's bedtime.
[521:53.39]Something like that.
[521:54.05]Hey!
[521:58.89]Where are we?
[522:01.99]FutureGamer, thanks for the 250.
[522:02.87]There's a new VR RPG called Shadow Legend with voice recognition.
[522:08.19]That came out today.
[522:09.57]On a separate note, I have 18 rooms clipped and timed.
[522:16.24]Shadow Legend.
[522:18.06]I'm gonna have to look this up right now.
[522:19.22]Shadow Legend.
[522:27.11]RPG exclusive for VR where you play as the Grandmaster of the Knights Templar in a story-driven medieval crusade.
[522:31.79]Freely explore densely filled worlds and use your sword, bow, and magic to save the kingdom from the destruction of Lord Adderoth.
[522:39.54]And it's voice controlled?
[522:43.12]I might have to play this.
[522:49.94]This looks pretty good.
[522:50.82]You can feed horses carrots?
[522:55.28]Alright, add that to the list.
[523:02.79]Thank you, FutureGamer.
[523:03.53]Thank you something or other for the $2.50.
[523:04.49]Hey, Jeremy, it's me from the Applebee's.
[523:06.52]I just want to say thank you again for taking the time to come over and say hi to us.
[523:09.96]It was really cool to meet you.
[523:12.62]As you might remember, it was my grandfather's 80th birthday, and while your grandmother's 80th birthday, and while her mind is slipping and she doesn't know what Twitch is, she loves meeting new people and thought you were a charming fellow.
[523:24.19]She had fun, and I'm really grateful.
[523:25.69]Just one quick question.
[523:27.13]Why did you spit in my food and slip my grandmother your cell phone number?
[523:35.45]Well, one, you were rude.
[523:38.03]Two, she asked for it.
[523:39.31]She, like, wanted me to give her my number.
[523:42.43]She, like, asked me for the number.
[523:45.93]What you don't tell, the story that you're not telling, is you came and spit in my food first.
[523:51.94]Three or four different times.
[523:55.16]I didn't even know who you were.
[523:57.88]You said, Jerma!
[523:59.42]Schpie!
[523:59.96]Schpie!
[524:00.22]You said, Schpie!
[524:01.14]Screaming Schpie in my ear.
[524:02.52]I'm at dinner with my girlfriend.
[524:06.94]And then you mashed up a bunch of Skittles in your mouth.
[524:11.51]I'm like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
[524:12.71]What's his problem?
[524:14.29]You swallowed and you did the big daddy Adam Sandler movie spit.
[524:19.15]But you dropped a huge, huge Skittle spit right onto my hamburger.
[524:24.31]They said they were going to call the police.
[524:29.93]Which I don't know if they did or not.
[524:31.21]You got out of there quick.
[524:32.97]I walked over.
[524:34.66]to your food and spit in yours.
[524:36.84]I don't have any Skittles though.
[524:39.62]Your grandmother simply said, by the way, what's your phone number so I can get in touch with you to repay you for the meal that my obnoxious grandson just ruined.
[524:54.59]So yeah, I gave my phone number to your grandmother.
[525:01.33]The whole story, guys.
[525:02.33]That's what happens when you don't get it.
[525:04.25]Unbelievable.
[525:11.55]I was there.
[525:15.84]I saw it.
[525:23.86]Is that what it takes?
[525:24.58]I'll thank you something or other for the $2.50 and...
[525:30.01]Happy 80th birthday to your grandma.
[525:33.64]I am now fully, mostly moistened thanks to the 250.
[525:36.60]For anyone that may have doubted that Jerma is a good man, I'll have you know that when he saw an old man beat up his pregnant genie girlfriend, he immediately ran him over with a car and made sure that the genie had a place to stay.
[525:48.09]What more proof do you need?
[525:51.17]Man, what the hell is going on there?
[525:59.00]Uh, lone...
[526:00.79]MGR, thanks for the $5.
[526:02.05]First time donating to a streamer.
[526:04.41]Love your content.
[526:05.07]Sorry it ain't much.
[526:06.39]Jerma nose wipe.
[526:07.11]Don't worry.
[526:07.59]Don't apologize for giving me money.
[526:12.71]Thanks for even considering.
[526:18.55]Thank you.
[526:22.19]I really appreciate it.
[526:28.91]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[526:32.17]Do not say sorry.
[526:38.35]Sorry for the cash.
[526:42.27]Ah, Peter, welcome back.
[526:43.66]Peter, P337R, thanks for the 20 bucks, Peter.
[526:48.22]Congrats on the baby, thank you.
[526:51.92]Congrats on the baby.
[526:55.00]Thank you for the $20 bill.
[526:55.66]2,000 bits.
[526:55.86]Thank you, Peter.
[527:03.39]Good to see you.
[527:06.72]The Thrill.
[527:07.34]Thanks for the five dollars, The Thrill.
[527:08.58]Jerm, I'm sorry I called you a dickbag last night.
[527:10.80]It was a big boy word I learned at work recently.
[527:13.64]I was tired and half asleep when I slung that at you.
[527:16.26]In my defense, things were getting heated in regards to the concepts and definitions of cheating.
[527:21.02]Thanks for tonight's fun.
[527:22.28]P.S.
[527:22.78]Whatever happened to Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy?
[527:27.19]It's funny you mention Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy because I will be seeing him very soon.
[527:37.07]Still a friend?
[527:38.09]Still kicking around?
[527:41.67]On the next stream?
[527:42.66]No.
[527:49.76]A lot of the people and a lot of the friends that I have from, you know, before even I turned on a YouTube video.
[527:59.55]No, they're still around.
[528:00.15]I still talk to them.
[528:01.19]I still hang out with them.
[528:04.75]We still converse.
[528:08.48]When is Minecraft VR on the next VR stream?
[528:10.85]Which will be probably next week.
[528:14.55]I will get that set up.
[528:16.63]We'll do another like three or four games.
[528:18.21]And then during that VR session, I want to also do Mind Show.
[528:22.11]So we'll get that started too.
[528:25.50]Just want to take a break from VR.
[528:28.28]Can't just go pedal on the ground.
[528:33.24]You just did it today and it's awesome.
[528:35.10]I'm looking forward to it.
[528:36.16]I've played for at least an hour.
[528:39.21]But thank you, The Thrill.
[528:41.55]Don't worry, I know you guys are just fucking around.
[528:46.24]I say a lot of dumb shit too, and it's just me messing around as well.
[528:51.38]Thank you, Pigeon for the 250.
[528:52.60]You know, if you go into the settings, you can edit the limit of NPC Sims.
[528:56.14]You could have parties with like a hundred people.
[528:58.95]Also just wanted you to know that it was me who suggested Sims for the first time, and I was the one who caused this stream.
[529:05.19]I did.
[529:13.45]Every suggestion is great.
[529:19.53]I'm grateful for a lot of the suggestions over the years.
[529:23.07]Recommendations.
[529:24.11]They've turned out to be amazing experiences.
[529:31.83]Thank you for the $2.50.
[529:32.29]Appreciate it.
[529:35.44]Beware, I live.
[529:36.42]Thanks for the 250.
[529:36.96]I hate when none of the original cast is left when a series ends.
[529:40.88]They always jump the shark with a baby, and then everyone leaves.
[529:44.82]Can't wait for the spinoff.
[529:46.41]I'm Gnott, a detective gnome.
[529:54.69]God.
[529:58.23]There are a lot of subs tonight, too.
[530:02.41]Let's go ahead and start running them.
[530:04.07]So you can see
[530:07.34]All the subs.
[530:08.36]Thank you, everybody.
[530:11.56]Much love to you all.
[530:15.73]Thank you, BeWhereILive.
[530:18.55]And DubskiDude, thanks for the $2.50.
[530:19.73]DubskiDude.
[530:20.65]Don't know if this has been asked before, but what are your chances... What are the chances of an all-star Jerma Rumble with all the old favorites?
[530:27.81]Every Rumble adds new wrestlers, and I feel like we're drifting further from what made the original Rumbles great.
[530:32.84]If you considered it.
[530:34.12]And the Jerma trading cards, too.
[530:37.11]Yeah, we actually talked about the trading card thing like a week or two ago.
[530:41.13]Just about how it was going to cost a ton of money.
[530:44.88]And it needs to be something that I can reliably do and be comfortable doing.
[530:50.28]As to the Jerma Rumble stuff... Yeah, it's just a different beast on Twitch because how it used to be is I would... Especially 2k14 is the last thing I think people don't realize.
[531:03.89]is in 2K14, I could make scenarios happen.
[531:09.52]I could go in and edit.
[531:11.32]And, like, for instance, when Demon Lord Zaraxos in Jerma Rumble 3 goes into the ring, that doesn't happen in the game.
[531:19.82]I had to string all that together with editing.
[531:23.90]And different camera angles and stuff.
[531:28.14]So it's not like, oh, why don't you just... They're very different.
[531:33.95]Really, yeah.
[531:38.71]The new games that have come out since 2K14 got rid of a lot of the creative stuff.
[531:48.74]You're not able to have somebody backstage put in actors and have the characters punch each other and throw each other through tables.
[531:57.09]You can't do them anymore.
[531:59.88]Now, one would say, why don't you just go back and do 2K14?
[532:02.51]We talked about that.
[532:03.45]Why?
[532:03.89]And here's another reason why.
[532:05.69]I did everything I could do in 2K14.
[532:08.97]Every little cutscene, every little story arc, little cutscene edit that I could do, I did it.
[532:13.80]Because there's only a finite amount of them.
[532:17.80]One of the reasons why I even did the Jerma Rumble live action is because there was nothing else for me to actually physically do in 2K14.
[532:26.87]I couldn't do anything else.
[532:28.67]So I was like, fuck it, I'll do it on my own.
[532:32.57]I'll just hire people and make it.
[532:39.36]But that's why...
[532:42.55]They probably feel a little different now because the tools that are in the new WWE games are terrible.
[532:50.49]They're just, they're absolutely awful.
[532:53.11]They're awful.
[532:54.74]The only saving grace that these new WWE games have are the import image feature.
[533:01.54]And it's just a giant band-aid for not being able to create characters that you want to create.
[533:09.86]Now, I could go back to 2K14 just for the sake of making better characters, but I've brought this up too.
[533:17.05]Going back, that was an end-of-life PS3 game that they didn't bring or didn't port anywhere.
[533:25.59]They pushed the PS3 to the absolute limit, and if you have more than a few characters,
[533:33.79]Making characters is hell.
[533:36.47]There's so much slowdown, it lags, the new games at least don't have that.
[533:41.47]Once you get five, ten, twelve layers on a character, it's pain.
[533:48.47]Even turning their bodies and looking at a different angle drops the game down to like four frames a second.
[534:01.29]The new ones now just crash in the middle of the match.
[534:03.12]Yes, that's true.
[534:06.96]But they've stripped a lot.
[534:09.50]Is it still possible to remake old characters in the new game and do it that way?
[534:12.64]I mean, I probably could.
[534:16.61]It wouldn't be that big of a deal, especially if it was like an all-star thing.
[534:24.27]I'm hoping that, and I've been saying this for five straight years now,
[534:31.05]After 2K15.
[534:31.75]Man, okay.
[534:34.01]Next year, maybe they'll lighten up a little bit.
[534:36.83]And make the creative characters a little less serious.
[534:40.66]Oh, we're gonna get new creation suite stuff.
[534:42.68]Cool.
[534:43.02]Oh, what is it?
[534:43.68]No.
[534:44.80]No, it's not anything interesting.
[534:46.56]What about next year?
[534:47.48]Nope.
[534:48.44]What about three years ago?
[534:50.77]Going forward four years now.
[534:53.19]Nope.
[534:55.22]They want that game to be taken as a serious wrestling simulation and not as a fun experience.
[535:03.21]They want that to be a fighting game.
[535:07.33]Strangely enough.
[535:10.73]So that leaves me in a weird position to making characters and... God, I wish this was 2K14.
[535:18.93]So instead of complaining about it all the time, which I still do.
[535:21.43]How many times have you heard me complain about the new games?
[535:28.77]It's just not worth going back and dealing with old technology.
[535:36.70]Very long-winded response, but... Doing like an all-star thing would be pretty fun.
[535:45.44]What about other wrestling games?
[535:46.60]There really aren't any.
[535:49.14]The 2K wrestling games are the only ones that...
[535:52.50]have really any... I can't think of any other wrestling games that exist.
[536:03.18]Unless you're talking about some of the 2D ones that are essentially Flash games.
[536:08.08]Yeah, the McDickey ones.
[536:09.46]That's the ones I'm talking about.
[536:11.54]Not McDickey.
[536:13.04]What's his name?
[536:13.90]MDickey?
[536:21.02]Soul Calibur is kind of good.
[536:21.96]You probably make some characters in that too.
[536:23.36]Yeah, that's true.
[536:26.06]But that's another, I guess, response for that.
[536:31.19]Thank you to all the subs.
[536:32.05]We had Jess, you got it, came in right at the end with 250.
[536:34.27]This is an AI that creates faces.
[536:38.09]Reload it to get a new face every time.
[536:40.55]Have a good night.
[536:41.11]I've actually seen this.
[536:43.11]This person does not exist.
[536:44.15]Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[536:47.67]Is it weird that I don't believe this?
[536:53.38]They could just say that these are AI faces and they just upload the whole employee notebook.
[536:57.88]You know, how many people work at Google?
[537:00.54]Like 4,000?
[537:01.08]5,000?
[537:01.14]But that's going to be it, guys.
[537:13.38]Thank you, everybody, for watching.
[537:15.71]Hope you had a good time.
[537:18.37]I'll see you guys, uh, I definitely, I'm not gonna be more than a day or two.
[537:25.22]But doctor's appointment tomorrow, I got some stuff to take care of and continue.
[537:29.64]Stream, oh, stream legends, right, right, right, I'll give you, I gotta give you guys your gear.
[537:34.21]I've got gear to give you guys.
[537:42.09]I gotta remember to do that.
[537:47.73]See you guys soon.
[537:48.41]I'll let you know on Twitter and on Discord and stuff what's going on.
[537:52.09]Much love to you.
[537:52.79]See you soon.
[537:57.02]How do I get the gift?
[537:57.90]Oh, here it is.
[538:03.10]Here it comes.
[538:03.96]Three, two, one.
[538:07.72]Loot!
[538:08.72]Hooray.
[538:13.90]Take care.
[538:14.96]See you soon.
[538:50.01]Thank you.
