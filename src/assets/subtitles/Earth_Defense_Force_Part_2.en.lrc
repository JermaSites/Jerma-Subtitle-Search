[ve:60.16.100]

[00:06.15]Alive.
[00:10.04]Give me one second.
[00:12.20]Gotta make sure this shit turns off.
[00:19.55]More EDF.
[00:42.42]Hi, guys.
[00:44.87]Yeah, you know what?
[00:46.19]You know what?
[00:47.05]Nah.
[00:49.29]I've just... Nah, I'm going off the grid.
[00:52.25]You know what I mean?
[00:53.35]I'm turning this frame off.
[00:54.11]I'm going off the grid.
[00:56.34]What do you think, Star?
[00:58.98]I know where you are.
[00:59.84]You think I should just go off the grid?
[01:01.24]Yeah.
[01:01.38]Actually, you know what?
[01:04.72]Yeah.
[01:05.70]Because, you know, growing up, you know, I didn't have any, like, good Christmases, and I just, like, I want to disappoint other people, so you should just, like, start your stream every now and again.
[01:13.75]Go up to the other channel.
[01:18.63]I don't think he knows what I meant by that.
[01:22.29]Hey, go up to the correct channel.
[01:24.27]We're on the correct channel right now.
[01:25.65]Now he goes.
[01:26.07]Now he goes.
[01:26.69]Okay.
[01:27.59]It takes time to alt-tab.
[01:28.73]Alright.
[01:29.71]What were you saying about Christmas or something?
[01:32.35]Christmas.
[01:33.27]Nothing.
[01:33.61]It doesn't matter.
[01:35.87]I had bad Christmases.
[01:37.49]Hi guys, yes, we're playing EDF tonight.
[01:39.43]We actually figured out how this game works.
[01:41.35]A little bit.
[01:44.57]Please ignore chat some more.
[01:46.89]No, I can't.
[01:47.78]How am I supposed to watch the chat when I'm going off the grid?
[01:52.46]It's not going to be possible.
[01:59.95]I hope you guys are doing good.
[02:01.43]We're going to continue the EDF grind.
[02:04.76]Just gonna play.
[02:06.10]We obviously had fun playing last night and we did some off-stream stuff to make sure we knew what the hell we were doing.
[02:12.08]And now we kind of know.
[02:12.80]I did more than him.
[02:13.28]I'm more hardcore than him.
[02:14.12]I played a lot last night.
[02:17.18]Wait, what?
[02:21.16]Alright, ready?
[02:22.10]Let's go.
[02:22.64]Day, the L-D-O-D-D-O-D-O-D-O-D, Los Demons.
[02:25.42]There it is.
[02:26.18]This mission is very fun.
[02:27.50]You ready?
[02:28.97]I am ready.
[02:29.43]What?
[02:30.71]Are you ready?
[02:33.71]Are you ready?
[02:36.25]How do you say demons?
[02:41.45]Offstream stuff, yeah.
[02:44.25]Yeah.
[02:44.95]So glad you guys are playing this again.
[02:46.23]Yeah, well, we had fun playing it last night, so... Whoa!
[02:51.73]I don't remember this.
[02:52.49]This is the first time I'm using this weapon, by the way.
[02:54.03]Oh, well, there's just going to be a lot of ants and those things drop them.
[02:59.14]Huh?
[03:01.51]What happened?
[03:02.97]What happened?
[03:03.73]I don't know.
[03:05.27]I really don't.
[03:05.85]I don't know.
[03:06.91]You guys need to see my super soaker.
[03:08.45]Look at my super soaker.
[03:15.06]Holy shit, they're like everywhere.
[03:21.56]We're getting out of the super soaker already.
[03:24.23]Oh my god.
[03:29.99]You guys didn't think I had like the best fucking item in the world?
[03:31.93]The Super Soaker?
[03:33.51]Got this one off stream.
[03:35.87]It shoots poison goo.
[03:38.97]This guy didn't have poison goo?
[03:41.82]Look at that.
[03:42.68]It's just like sprayed all over.
[03:43.88]It's amazing.
[03:53.18]Okay, I thought that was a bad guy.
[03:55.15]Hold on.
[03:56.87]What?
[03:58.94]I only got so much acid per clip.
[04:03.62]Get him off of me.
[04:07.17]Hold on, I only got so much acid per clip.
[04:08.73]God damn it.
[04:12.63]Get him off of me.
[04:13.83]We're good.
[04:14.57]You got another one coming.
[04:16.45]Okay, maybe we're not good.
[04:18.37]Pick up the treasures.
[04:28.52]Collect this stuff.
[04:29.42]We don't want to be too gimped, you know what I mean?
[04:40.19]What's the trajectory on these things?
[04:43.35]It's the first time using this weapon, so I don't know.
[04:45.17]Oh, fuck.
[04:54.40]Oh my god.
[04:56.13]This hasn't gone well for me at all.
[05:00.73]I haven't... Oh god.
[05:08.04]Hold on.
[05:10.36]Tactical dodging.
[05:12.14]No.
[05:12.84]No, we're dead.
[05:16.29]I do not like the weapons I equip.
[05:18.35]That was the experimental, what's this weapon do?
[05:20.91]Yeah.
[05:21.93]I don't like what weapon do.
[05:26.70]That acid gun looks stupid.
[05:30.66]No, it's actually pretty good at close range.
[05:32.16]I didn't like the other thing I had, though.
[05:35.50]I want to go back to the other one I had.
[05:37.16]I mean, do you want me just to, like, heal the shit out of you with my other super soldier?
[05:43.23]No, no, no.
[05:43.93]I just explained I was doing experiment.
[05:46.67]Also, your Super Soaker heals.
[05:49.63]I have a Super Soaker that heals.
[05:51.54]That's pretty cool.
[05:53.64]But no.
[05:54.40]Okay.
[05:58.14]Okay.
[05:59.62]Wait, what happened to level 11?
[06:01.42]We don't talk about level 11.
[06:03.20]We don't talk about level 11 here.
[06:06.34]We're level 11.
[06:07.36]We beat that last night.
[06:08.66]It was the easiest mission we've ever played.
[06:11.58]Yeah, just one enemy.
[06:12.59]It's really easy.
[06:16.76]So what are you using now?
[06:19.36]I had, you know the limpet launcher you shoot it out and you detonate it?
[06:22.10]Yeah.
[06:22.54]I had a limpet launcher with 30 rounds, and it just sprayed like, it was very uncomfortable and unsettling.
[06:29.43]Dude, how funny would that be if I shot that once and it exploded?
[06:34.09]It would be funny.
[06:35.45]I'm gonna get, I have to get an air shot.
[06:38.23]Oh, I almost got one.
[06:40.80]Damn it.
[06:47.07]Oh boy, here they come.
[06:47.99]Time to switch to acid gun right now.
[07:02.93]Back to reality.
[07:05.31]Oh, there goes gravity.
[07:07.39]You know what I'm saying?
[07:12.60]I do.
[07:12.92]I'm just trying to pick up this shit so we don't lose it.
[07:18.41]Reload my guns.
[07:20.27]Yeah, I'm I'm I I mostly don't move So if you want to pick stuff up the right ahead, yeah, I'll be pick stuff up guys this point I'm going in There's one aunt Don't leave him up so we can get this shit.
[07:41.65]Well, I think they're still yeah.
[07:43.25]No arrests are coming.
[07:44.36]Oh
[07:48.22]Maybe I'm gonna back the fuck up here.
[07:49.60]I'm gonna get trapped in there.
[07:53.62]Not smart for me to be all the way up there.
[07:56.68]Or is it?
[07:57.66]Yeah.
[08:04.66]Acid.
[08:06.88]Oh, I gotta get out.
[08:07.98]I gotta get out.
[08:11.92]Back up the stairs.
[08:13.82]Drain them into the stairs.
[08:25.52]Know if I'm gonna be met boy, I kind of do want to just make the game.
[08:29.24]No, I have a controller.
[08:30.20]Oh What is it hard to control without those things are so hard to control I don't know how you've been using it without a controller Not hard, but it would be a lot a lot easier.
[08:42.07]I am totally stuck by the way.
[08:44.87]What I
[08:47.58]Star!
[08:49.46]Star!
[08:50.90]What?
[08:51.62]You're dead?
[08:52.08]There's like four ants here, but they were all on top of my mech when I moved.
[08:55.80]God!
[08:58.68]I gotta get that ass again.
[08:59.76]Well, I almost got surrounded.
[09:01.30]You're fine.
[09:08.12]I can't roll through this goddamn ant car, because I pretty much couldn't move.
[09:12.62]Make our way down this way, where all the health packs and shit are.
[09:16.78]There's a lot of things to collect over here.
[09:18.54]We need to get them.
[09:28.77]Yeah, I'm okay.
[09:31.31]How you doing?
[09:32.59]Good.
[09:33.55]Good.
[09:33.79]Where do I see my points?
[09:35.87]How many credits I got?
[09:38.93]Just input your credit card.
[09:43.61]Oh, it's basically the wrong way.
[09:44.83]I'll see you in a year.
[09:47.98]Here they come!
[09:48.68]We're gonna get overwhelmed!
[09:49.90]Alright, time to be... Time to be a good boy.

[09:58.42]No!
[10:00.40]Time to be a good boy!
[10:01.54]You're supposed to be being a good boy!
[10:03.20]I had fucking... You saw the first shot!
[10:07.40]Dude, I had full health!
[10:08.76]Yeah, I saw the first shot.
[10:10.78]I didn't think you were gonna... Like, I was right in front of you.
[10:12.76]I didn't think you were gonna unload on me.
[10:13.90]I have no depth perception!
[10:15.50]Oh god, we need to get health.
[10:18.12]Don't worry, I'll protect us with the acid gun!
[10:22.20]Is there any more health packs over here?
[10:23.30]Yeah, there's one.
[10:31.51]I'm fucking so dead over here.
[10:33.35]Can I shoot you again?
[10:34.33]Just shoot over here.
[10:35.23]Just shoot over there.
[10:40.97]Get away from me!
[10:43.31]No!
[10:44.03]Get away from me.
[10:44.58]There's like two that are just trying to eat me.
[10:55.91]Get out of here!
[10:56.63]I have just enough health to get hit once and die.
[11:07.32]What are you launching over here?
[11:09.12]What?
[11:09.58]Nothing.
[11:10.22]Why do I see that?
[11:13.38]They blew up my family again.
[11:17.85]Oh, I'm dead.
[11:18.67]That was me.
[11:21.12]Oh.
[11:22.36]It's alright, I'll be fine.
[11:23.00]I was gonna say... Do the ants have grenades now?
[11:26.92]It's gonna be close!
[11:41.53]It was close when I did this mission solo with Fly Girl.
[11:46.11]Uh, I'm not dead yet.
[11:49.37]It'll be fine.
[11:49.89]It's just a couple stragglers.
[11:51.25]There's a health kit even near my body.
[11:53.27]Oh no, there's a bunch more coming at you.
[11:55.05]I think these are the last ones, though.
[12:06.18]Get away from me!
[12:13.28]This guy beat Dark Souls.
[12:14.26]I believe in him.
[12:15.24]It's just dodge rolls, you know?
[12:17.88]Yeah.
[12:19.46]Yeah.
[12:24.54]If I get hit one fucking time.
[12:26.61]Come on, is that health?
[12:27.25]No, it's not.
[12:27.65]It's a fucking weapon.
[12:39.63]Come on!
[12:44.41]Oh, is that health back?
[12:45.09]No, it's not health.
[12:49.95]Jesus!
[12:50.55]Come on, give me that health back!
[12:53.01]Fuck off, you big, giant insects!
[12:56.93]He's got him, giant insects.
[12:58.34]And he did it!
[12:59.48]He did it!
[13:01.88]If you just blew me up, I would have fucking cried.
[13:03.46]Alright, let's get some of the fucking health.
[13:12.00]I think that's it.
[13:12.88]You just have to go and pick stuff up.
[13:14.36]Oh wait, no, I might have nuked the last ant.
[13:18.24]Yeah, pick up stuff.
[13:19.68]Shit!
[13:19.88]You killed the last ant.
[13:21.56]You killed the last ant.
[13:22.92]I killed the last ant.
[13:24.17]You... I was excited.
[13:28.25]I was alive for once.
[13:32.59]Oh, it's alright.
[13:35.72]Yeah, just roll around the ant tomatoes.
[13:38.00]That would be fine.
[13:41.66]That feeling when a guy kills the last ant.
[13:49.82]I kind of like this.
[13:53.70]Never trust purple thanks to the 10 bucks they say.
[13:57.31]Did you guys ever figure out what was handicapping you?
[13:59.53]Don't want to make the same mistake when I pressure friends into playing with me.
[14:03.53]Yes, we found out what we were doing wrong.
[14:05.79]And we're still doing it wrong.
[14:07.29]We're still doing it wrong, but we're not doing it as wrong.
[14:10.64]Star, if you'd like to explain, go for it.
[14:13.84]It's pretty much...
[14:16.06]Diablo, and if you don't play through normal first, you're gonna have a really hard time when you're suddenly in nightmare and everything can one-shot kill you.
[14:22.98]But normal is really boring.
[14:25.34]Yeah.
[14:25.64]So why would you do it?
[14:27.41]That's kind of a dilemma.
[14:31.31]Yeah.
[14:32.97]Yeah, just about.
[14:33.81]But, thanks, Purple.
[14:37.13]Also, thank you to the Aswan Son, KomodoDragonZ...

[15:04.70]It's the same one.
[15:05.40]I want to do this one one more time.
[15:07.94]I like this mission a lot.
[15:09.48]The next one, I'm not sure if we'll be able to do it.
[15:12.06]Unless I'm Flygirl either.
[15:16.05]And then it's still a really hard mission.
[15:17.69]Ah, you see that?
[15:21.81]Got one.
[15:23.31]Two air shots?
[15:24.31]Did you see that?
[15:25.56]Three air shots in a row.
[15:28.19]I mean, I don't want to toot my own horn or anything, but holy shit.
[15:31.73]I mean, when you hit that many air shots, you deserve to toot your horn.
[15:34.04]I mean, kind of.

[16:30.94]I want, like, as many people as possible, like, to take care of me.
[16:34.56]And, like, do everything that I say.
[16:36.04]Another air shot?
[16:41.41]Oh, you can get in this helicopter.
[16:43.69]There's, like, the Gatling guns on the side.
[16:45.47]Oh, that's what this helicopter is.
[16:48.41]Get in.
[16:48.97]Get in.
[16:49.43]Huh?
[16:49.53]What do you mean, get in?
[16:50.27]We're having friend time.
[16:51.21]Friend time?
[16:51.57]Go up to this helicopter.
[16:52.48]Friend time.
[16:55.91]Hold on, I'm coming.

[17:12.26]I'm not in.
[17:13.36]I'm gonna die.
[17:13.66]It blew up.
[17:14.75]The thing blew up.
[17:15.35]It blew up.
[17:15.77]Is that what happened?
[17:16.95]Yeah.
[17:18.79]Friend time.
[17:19.87]No, stop saying friend time!
[17:21.23]We're not gonna have real friend time!
[17:24.21]It took a long time to get up here.
[17:25.67]Well, you can't just go... Friend time.
[17:28.63]And then expect me to be there.
[17:29.66]I was down getting fucking my hands dirty.
[17:31.64]I just wanted to have friend time.
[17:36.84]The thing fucking blows up when I press the... Oh my god, and now we're like fucked.
[17:42.57]I mean, if we're flying around in the battlefield helicopter, maybe we wouldn't be so fucked up.
[17:46.16]Alright, how about we do friend time at the very beginning the next time?
[17:48.92]You can't, because I have to earn enough credits to summon friend time.
[17:54.48]Wow, that was a pretty poor friend time.
[18:00.48]And speaking of poor friend time, you dropping, like, handfuls of grenades on me now?
[18:04.82]Uh, I shot a whale over there to help you.
[18:08.10]That's gonna kill me, not help me.
[18:09.92]Alright, make sure we don't... I need this help bad.
[18:16.54]Alright, now I'm back to reality.
[18:17.88]Oop, there goes gravity.
[18:18.54]Oop, there goes gravity.
[18:19.52]Oop, there goes gravity.
[18:22.20]How does the lyrics go?
[18:23.82]Back to reality.
[18:24.76]Oop, there goes gravity.
[18:26.18]Oop, there goes gravity.
[18:27.48]Oop, there goes gravity.
[18:30.08]Pretty sure that's it.
[18:31.60]How did we do that at the same time?
[18:35.60]Because you've done this before.
[18:37.47]I'm just quoting you.
[18:38.53]Have I done it before?
[18:40.29]Oh, yeah.
[18:40.99]I bet I have.
[18:41.73]You're right.
[18:42.37]What box is this?
[18:47.04]I want to think the same thing happened last time I'm getting as many of these as I can over here So you fight the enemies while I get the stuff Well, it's time here I'll kill the last day there is a lot of it over here Anything else Health boxes.
[19:10.13]Why can't we just have like There's someone pick it all up for a second when it's all said and done
[19:15.71]I mean, I'm picking it up right now.
[19:17.53]No, I mean, like... Like, we're the EDF.
[19:21.17]Oh, yeah.
[19:21.47]We have, like, a collector unit that comes in and gets everything.
[19:25.12]I also wish there was, like, some sort of, like, suction for the boxes.
[19:30.66]Yeah.
[19:32.88]I do, too.
[19:40.03]See, I don't even have another friend time yet.
[19:43.13]Well, you'll get it eventually.
[19:45.35]Yeah, by the time this mission's over, I don't think we're ever going to be friends again.
[19:50.00]It all kind of went downhill.
[19:51.96]You think so?
[20:00.02]Yeah.
[20:05.00]Ow.
[20:08.67]I'm getting surrounded on every single side of me.
[20:13.16]Oh god, oh god!
[20:15.14]One gun.
[20:16.08]What do you mean, oh god?
[20:19.33]Nothing.
[20:21.15]Oh, Gord!
[20:24.37]Alright, we're fine.
[20:25.35]Just make sure we don't kill the last one.
[20:28.91]I am the last chest.
[20:33.92]Alright, be quick.
[20:35.54]Be vigilant.
[20:36.98]Be easy.
[20:38.60]Oh, this is not a good gun for shooting ants.
[20:42.37]What are you using?
[20:44.29]I'm trying out the helicopter gun.
[20:46.51]It has 70 bullets and it's like one shot each.
[20:50.59]No, this vehicle sucks.
[20:57.07]Not a very good friend-o.
[21:01.81]Anything else?
[21:03.49]Help me pick up the armor and shit over here.
[21:05.52]I'm doing it.
[21:07.97]Three ants left.
[21:09.47]As long as we just run one of these ants around in a circle, we'll be fine.
[21:18.01]There's a bunch up here.
[21:21.05]Alright, friendo.
[21:22.67]Hey, he called me a friendo.
[21:23.71]That means we're, like, friends again.
[21:27.43]Isn't that what it means?
[21:28.89]Yeah.
[21:30.09]Hey.
[21:32.07]Uh-oh.
[21:33.17]Watch out!
[21:34.45]Watch out, he's just running around in a circle like an idiot.
[21:36.56]Alright, I think we're...
[21:38.88]Good enough?
[21:39.42]I think we're good enough.
[21:41.12]Yeah, just kill the last friend-o.
[21:43.84]He's not my friend-o.
[21:45.04]Well, he was until you shot him with a rocket launcher.
[21:50.38]Thank you, Foxboy21.
[21:51.26]And procrastinate!
[21:53.80]Procrastinate, boy!
[21:57.82]And thank you, PurpleRose, for those hundred bits!
[22:01.80]Ooh, I got some cool new things, I think.
[22:04.11]Splash grenade, prominence M1.
[22:06.51]The dinghy.
[22:07.03]I got the dinghy, too.
[22:14.04]Okay.
[22:16.58]Let me see what that is.
[22:20.46]Stingray.
[22:23.57]Prominence M1.
[22:24.91]Missile launcher.
[22:25.77]Holy shit.
[22:26.31]Hold on.
[22:28.27]A large, tenacious homing missile flies straight for five seconds before locking onto an enemy?
[22:33.37]By shooting it towards the sky, you can attack an enemy behind a building or out in the distance.
[22:37.95]Comes with a scope.
[22:41.34]How many, uh...
[22:44.86]Damage, rate of fire, reload time.
[22:48.85]Holy shit.
[22:49.39]Okay, I'm going to try this thing.
[22:52.29]Okay, this next mission?
[22:53.89]Yep.
[22:55.67]If you want to do the next one, you're going to need a very long-range powerful weapon.
[23:02.11]When those things open up to drop out the ants, we have to destroy them.
[23:05.15]Alright, well, let's just give it a try.
[23:06.45]I'm trying out the Prominence M1 grenade.
[23:10.19]But you have something that can shoot up.
[23:12.15]I have a super rocket launcher.
[23:15.77]What's max level weapon here?
[23:17.13]What are you looking at here?
[23:19.85]Looking at a 27 here.
[23:25.72]Prominence is pretty strong.
[23:27.40]Well, that's good to know.
[23:28.02]We're going to need it, aren't we?
[23:30.40]Hey, Matthew353.
[23:32.36]Thanks for the subscription.
[23:34.76]And Valium Valentine with 200 bits.
[23:36.46]My mom just got her credit limit raised, so here.
[23:38.82]Alright, well, I hope you had permission to do that.
[23:49.59]This isn't going to go well.
[23:50.55]How do you know that?
[23:51.13]It might go fantastically.
[23:54.89]I think it's going to go swimmingly.
[23:56.63]You need a super long-range weapon.
[23:57.83]Jerma picks a grenade.
[23:58.83]Did you see the other one I picked?
[24:01.39]No.
[24:02.15]I'm talking about my chat.
[24:05.13]I was just answering.
[24:08.17]I have, like, an ultra missile launcher right now.
[24:10.51]Okay.
[24:12.89]Now I have level 28 weapons, so let's go.
[24:15.55]I've been ready.
[24:16.19]I'm waiting on you.
[24:17.17]So, okay, you're telling me we gotta... Jerm is the boring ranger again?
[24:21.65]Well, we, like... Here's the thing.
[24:23.65]We fucked up bad.
[24:24.85]I was playing, like, this ranger for, like, half the game and switching around too much.
[24:30.60]Like, you have to, like, stick with something.
[24:32.56]Alright, what do I shoot?
[24:33.28]Shoot him!
[24:33.66]Shoot the mothership!
[24:35.54]You shoot the inside of it And there's just going to be a shit ton of ants everywhere I I can't shoot this Let's try a dinghy
[25:04.42]That's fucking hilarious.
[25:06.26]I'm gonna fucking throw it!
[25:07.32]What are you doing over there?
[25:12.18]Okay, this weapon is... Okay, we're gonna have to potentially restart here.
[25:18.01]So you don't have a long-range weapon?
[25:19.65]I do, but it's kind of... You got a hold of that for so long.
[25:30.18]It's like wind... Hold on.
[25:33.90]This thing's really good.
[25:34.78]We're going to try this.
[25:36.56]Alright, what about this one?
[25:38.82]Damage 50, reload time.
[25:41.16]Capacity 30.
[25:42.10]An upgraded M with better firepower, improved guidance system.
[25:44.96]Its lock-on maximum is increased.
[25:46.40]Okay, this is a lock-on.
[25:50.58]What about just my regular missile launcher?
[25:54.48]Like, how powerful does this need to be?
[25:57.90]Missile launcher is fine.
[25:59.60]I'm just saying like accurate enough that at range you could shoot into the top of it.
[26:02.78]Okay.
[26:04.10]And not like bullet fall off.
[26:05.26]Like I know some of the machine guns might not even reach how far you're going to have to shoot.
[26:08.42]I'm going to just have it on just because I want to see what it's like.
[26:15.09]I'm just going to use my two missile launchers.
[26:17.83]The regular one will be good enough for now.
[26:23.71]Use the cascade.
[26:24.75]My cascade is level 10.
[26:25.71]I need like a better one to try it really here.
[26:28.70]Well, Narfwack, I'll be able to handle it.
[26:33.70]Thank you, Gorord, for the subscription.
[26:35.86]Welcome to the Annihilators.
[26:39.72]Hey.
[26:41.54]Welcome to the Annihilator Club.
[26:46.26]I need to get, like, a sound for that.
[26:49.32]How are you already that far ahead?
[26:53.02]That's what I want to know.
[26:57.38]Fly girl, best girl.
[27:09.64]Watch it behind I'm going to need some tall buildings to stand on me of a couple That's why I wasn't trying to like blow them all up I blew that one up though.
[27:27.95]These guys have been so far away Shit
[27:39.52]Buckethead?
[27:40.92]Why am I a buckethead?
[27:45.58]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[27:48.48]I think a guy on our team ran by my crosshair when I pointed up and I shot him and hurt myself.
[27:56.78]Thanks a lot, you dumb EDF soldier.
[27:58.51]I don't care, I'm just going to blow those guys up.
[28:00.69]If they're going to do it to me, then I'll do it to them.
[28:03.01]See?
[28:03.27]See what I'm talking about?
[28:03.95]Get the fuck out of the way!
[28:06.49]Stop walking directly in front of me.
[28:09.12]Oh boy, I'm in trouble here man.
[28:13.10]I have nothing close range either.
[28:19.75]Ah yeah, we're gonna have to restart.
[28:21.75]I don't have anything I can do with close range.
[28:28.40]Retreat, I want the acid gun.
[28:30.94]I want the acid gun and the regular launcher.
[28:35.00]Unless you can bring me back, because I have two missile launchers right now.
[28:38.40]I can't shoot it, because I'll hurt myself.
[28:44.11]Yeah, give me the acid guns.
[28:45.07]There's just too many to surround you.
[28:47.51]Okay.
[28:47.85]Yeah, you just focus on ants.
[28:49.55]There's going to be a ton of them.
[28:51.93]Because I have to fly around and destroy the carriers.
[28:56.58]This thing is just better for that many.
[29:03.29]No rewinds.
[29:06.05]Here's the thing.
[29:06.53]I have to play the Ranger.
[29:08.05]Unless we play the game on normal.
[29:11.35]You have to play one class.
[29:12.81]It doesn't have to be Ranger.
[29:14.04]But you picked Ranger.
[29:15.74]I picked Ranger not knowing that that was going to happen.
[29:19.50]Then why did we just do Mission 2 a bunch of times with you guys Ranger?
[29:22.44]Because you could have made up for it.
[29:23.88]I like playing Ranger.
[29:24.94]I don't care playing Ranger.
[29:26.71]That's the thing you should say first.
[29:28.31]I like it.
[29:31.19]Not make excuses.
[29:37.28]Stop making excuses.
[29:49.05]I'm going to leave as many of these buildings up, so I'm not going to use my rocket launcher.
[29:52.97]I just only need the really tall one, so it's easier to fly at the transports.
[30:01.84]Fire!
[30:06.49]This secret slime action is being an ant Attack the open to hatch
[30:35.99]Commander Goodness
[31:05.00]Get acid gunned get laser gunned Be careful I'm right underneath you I know I'm good at video games Besides I killed you a little while ago.
[31:21.71]Yeah, you have done that a couple times only a couple Oh, do you only have to destroy one I don't know
[31:32.57]Because the other ones, I think, left.
[31:34.81]I thought you were good at video games.
[31:36.99]You rolled into that, you know it.
[31:45.24]I'm on the ground dead.
[31:47.18]Okay, I'm coming to get you, Jerma.
[31:56.10]What the fuck?
[31:57.32]You killed me again.
[31:59.22]I did not kill you.
[32:00.34]Alright, then how did I go from that guy back quickly?
[32:03.54]I didn't even get a chance to stand up.
[32:05.66]Same thing happened to me before.
[32:06.64]You didn't kill me.
[32:07.50]Oh, you're a real clowny man.
[32:09.82]Dude, what a klutz.
[32:13.13]Ah, collect some shit.
[32:14.09]I'm gonna need help and stuff.
[32:14.91]Stop doing it.
[32:16.35]Oh, there is another.
[32:17.43]Oh, they went over here.
[32:34.62]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[32:36.42]Anything else over here?
[32:37.60]Yep, another weapon.
[32:39.20]EDF!
[32:42.86]E... E3!
[32:45.18]Oh, I hit him right in his bum!
[32:58.43]That's actually great that they're finally through here.
[33:04.24]Oh no, this is gonna get rough.
[33:07.64]No, don't.
[33:08.40]It's gonna land on you, Jerma.
[33:09.46]The spaceship's gonna land on you!
[33:10.70]What are you talking about?
[33:11.94]Look up!
[33:12.76]Oh my fucking god!
[33:14.30]Holy shit!
[33:19.48]That's insane!
[33:20.80]That's- the scale is so huge!
[33:23.49]Oh!
[33:24.81]It actually can't land on you.
[33:26.23]Oh, but I wanted- that was a good spectacle.
[33:28.15]That was a good one.
[33:35.33]There's a bunch of armor and health over here that we missed.
[33:47.18]Stop shooting the Crunch Berries at me.
[33:50.57]They're cheese puffs.
[33:52.01]Please.
[33:53.61]They're really gross, whatever they are.
[33:59.23]Back to full health.
[34:03.76]I'm just trying to run over here and collect.
[34:07.32]It's the Xbox 720?
[34:08.81]What is that?
[34:10.97]I think once I destroy the... I don't know if we have to finish the ants, so I'm just making sure I'm collecting a bunch.
[34:21.43]This city is quite leveled.
[34:23.91]This is destroyed.
[34:26.09]But I think you could just sit here all day and farm armor if you were an EDF player.
[34:32.07]You probably could.
[34:33.48]One who plays EDF.
[34:39.06]We've got already a lot of armor already.
[34:42.43]Quite a bit.
[34:48.47]Quite a bit already.
[34:51.11]Can you get this game on your VCR?
[34:55.80]I don't know why I think that's so funny.
[34:57.98]I think you can.
[34:58.34]Can you get this game on my VCR?
[35:08.36]Uh, can you jump up?
[35:09.70]I can't, like, get up there.
[35:10.90]Oh, it's just help, never mind.
[35:13.68]Never mind.
[35:14.00]You see what I'm doing?
[35:15.64]You're flying around, being a f- Dude, you've taken out the Millennium Falcon.
[35:19.39]Do you think Chewbacca's flying that thing?
[35:24.03]Am I supposed to be shooting the middle of these things to help you?
[35:30.59]If you can hit it, yeah, because it's- Thank you.
[35:34.78]It's very hard to get all the way up there.
[35:38.58]That's what I'm talking about.
[35:41.61]I just did Independence Day 3.
[35:43.01]Come on, open up again.
[35:44.71]I don't fucking dare you.
[35:51.29]Ooh.
[35:52.39]Fly into the center of it.
[35:55.79]Yeah, the mothership.
[35:56.91]Not so motherly now, are you?
[36:00.27]I just did an Independence Day.
[36:02.49]No, I did.
[36:04.66]No, I want to be very clear that it was me.
[36:06.28]Shit.
[36:07.24]Oh, no.
[36:07.68]Shit.
[36:07.90]That turns out that's just like the Enterprise.
[36:10.73]We were just trying to go to another dimension.
[36:13.59]What the fuck did you do, Spock?
[36:17.93]Oh, shit.
[36:18.97]I told you not to unload any more ants on this planet.
[36:22.01]We were collecting those ants for agricultural purposes, Spock.
[36:25.53]And you have killed us.
[36:27.41]Yeah.
[36:30.10]Wait, that's the last ant.
[36:31.06]Don't kill the last ant.
[36:31.94]Make sure we get everything.
[36:34.74]I told you not to press the ant button.
[36:42.05]We picked those up on SporeDoc.
[36:43.77]We were trying to bring them to the fucking Star Trek Zoo.
[36:46.61]That's the new movie.
[36:48.73]Star Trek Zoo.
[36:50.64]Star Trek Zoo.
[36:54.52]That's the name of the movie.
[36:56.64]Hopefully our idiots don't kill this guy.
[37:00.96]Yeah, our idiot guy killed him.
[37:04.92]That was a good mission.
[37:05.66]That was fun.
[37:10.75]Yeah.
[37:12.67]Yes, fuck.
[37:22.29]Oh, yeah.
[37:25.37]Hey.
[37:27.13]Mr. Azick, or M. Razick, MJ, thanks for this up.
[37:31.34]Goddamn, though.
[37:32.02]No new fucking weapons.
[37:34.30]Really?
[37:34.54]I ain't got any new ones either.
[37:36.63]39 armor.
[37:37.57]Yeah, that's pretty good.
[37:40.47]But thank you, Mr. MJ.
[37:42.55]Purple, thanks for the 500 bits.
[37:43.59]Imagine this game in VR.
[37:45.63]That would be actually pretty awesome.
[37:47.99]Thanks for the five bucks, dude.
[37:50.67]Um, I haven't played this one, but it looks like there's giant minigun robots.
[37:55.05]It'd be vomit-inducing.
[37:57.75]Yeah, probably.
[37:58.60]Yeah, because you have to whip around so much.
[38:01.14]What is this one?
[38:01.80]There's giant walking aliens?
[38:04.64]It looks like I haven't played it.
[38:06.80]Spock, we told you not to drop the fucking giant robots on this planet.
[38:10.89]We were studying it for artificial intelligence.
[38:12.55]What is this buckethead joke?
[38:13.55]Am I missing something?
[38:15.53]Everyone's calling us bucket heads.
[38:16.79]You're a bucket head.
[38:18.25]Oh, I told a story about bucket heads on my stream, but I don't think it was that... What is it?
[38:22.89]Mr. Azick?
[38:23.89]I'll just call you... Oh, okay.
[38:26.99]Tooth cleaning would be pretty good here, I think.
[38:28.53]Oh, I have some things that would be very good for killing these, but...
[38:34.78]I did not bring them.
[38:35.52]I did not know we were going to do fly guys.
[38:37.76]Well, I think the puke gun is not going to work here.
[38:42.56]These guys are far.
[38:43.26]Yeah, I think this might be a long-range potential tooth cleaning, but we'll see.
[38:50.64]It takes like three ruckuses to kill these guys.
[38:57.33]Oh, you can get in my tank.
[38:58.75]Can I?
[38:59.71]Yeah.
[39:01.51]Yeah, fuck the fucking goddamn puke gun.
[39:03.27]Get in my tank.
[39:04.25]I'm coming.
[39:06.72]We're going to have a tank mission.
[39:08.04]Alright, friend time.
[39:11.16]Oh, I'm so sorry, everybody watching right now.
[39:12.68]This is going to give me a headache.
[39:14.02]Ay-yi-yi.
[39:22.23]I'm so sorry right now.
[39:23.69]This is bad.
[39:25.81]I can't even hold it down because it hurts too much to look at.
[39:30.27]Ow.
[39:31.61]I kind of want to get out.
[39:32.21]I'm not kidding.
[39:33.35]Okay, you can get out.
[39:35.69]But this is like too like effective.
[39:37.41]I can't.
[39:39.05]Is it killing them quick?
[39:40.04]I mean, I feel like it's doing something good.
[39:42.96]Especially the big robots down the way.
[39:45.48]My big robots are getting a railgun very well.
[39:48.94]I mean, I could just use it and have it sit here like we are anyway.
[39:51.38]Run around and shoot.
[39:53.48]It's empty.
[39:54.36]I don't really want to look at that anymore.
[39:55.72]I'll just pick them off with my superior rocket skills.
[39:58.32]Game sucks?
[39:59.90]No, I'll just get them with my superior rocket shooting skills.
[40:05.10]Well, missions like this with the beach, what I'm talking about, where Fencer gets really fun, and you just barrage missiles at everything.
[40:10.50]These things are so far away, too.
[40:14.49]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[40:24.82]What are they even shooting at?
[40:25.76]I don't understand.
[40:27.66]We have soldiers on the beach and tanks and stuff.
[40:29.58]You don't see them?
[40:30.96]I guess, but he kinda just lets us do whatever the hell he wants.
[40:33.51]I'm gonna go acid this guy.
[40:38.49]Is that a bad idea?
[40:42.08]Go get him.
[40:43.02]Okay.
[40:44.18]You won't... They're gonna be dead before you get up there.
[40:48.69]Yeah, probably.
[40:51.22]That guy's like stuck.
[40:52.82]He just like tackled.
[40:54.22]Alright, what was that game we played?
[40:55.70]Where like you moved and did body slams to each other really shittily and like mathematical... Game Beasts?
[41:00.92]No.
[41:02.86]It was, you picked... The sword fighting one?
[41:04.38]You picked like joints and you moved a joint and it played out.
[41:09.46]What is that called?
[41:10.21]Yeah, what the hell is it called?
[41:11.83]It's got a weird name.
[41:13.07]It does have a weird name.
[41:17.98]Tamagotchi.
[41:19.05]It was something.
[41:20.79]It actually was something.
[41:22.87]Oh, this gun is awful.
[41:24.25]Toribash.
[41:25.89]Yeah, those guys were just notorious.
[41:27.79]Oh, there's more guys coming.
[41:30.83]Yeah, I have a headache instantly from that.
[41:32.59]I'm surprised you lasted as long as you did.
[41:34.69]Yeah, dude, this would be so much better with one of my long-range missile launchers.
[41:38.62]But he might still just win.
[41:41.36]Not like it really matters.
[41:42.16]We're fine.
[41:42.82]We have a bunch of tanks and I have good stuff for this.
[41:46.29]I guess we can just, for free, I'm just going to keep shooting this guy for free.
[41:51.08]Whoa!
[41:52.80]Wow!
[41:54.20]Oh, are you picking stuff up?
[42:02.65]Yeah.
[42:04.21]You're going to have to get the stuff over on the left, I'll get the stuff on the right.
[42:09.41]Need mechs to fight mechs.
[42:10.57]Yeah, we really do, don't we?
[42:16.19]Distance yourselves from the enemy.
[42:17.35]What the hell are they talking about?
[42:18.79]They're doing air... air... They're bombing them.
[42:26.68]Nice!
[42:28.26]Nice!
[42:29.64]Nice!
[42:33.30]What?
[42:33.44]What did he say?
[42:35.57]Something about a bonsai tree?
[42:38.67]This is like a super boring mission for me right now.
[42:41.15]Whatever, I'll take it.
[42:41.83]I'll be collecting item guy.
[42:45.50]Hey, you picked Ranger.
[42:46.96]Got him.
[42:48.76]Yeah, well, Ranger's fun.
[42:49.46]Alright, I can heal my teammates.
[42:53.98]Get healed.
[42:56.86]A bunch of stuff on this beach.
[43:04.72]I want to acid this guy.
[43:09.18]I'm going for it.
[43:10.56]How far can I go in the water?
[43:11.52]We'll find out.
[43:12.86]Oh, god damn it.
[43:15.66]He's got an item drop right there, too.
[43:18.78]Am I gonna drown?
[43:20.47]That's the last one.
[43:21.21]I'm not killing it.
[43:21.89]Because there's so many items here.
[43:23.27]No, I guess I can't drown.
[43:24.15]I was scared that I was gonna just Dark Souls into the ground and lose.
[43:28.93]Holy shit, where the hell are these things?
[43:30.43]I know there's a weapon over here, though.
[43:36.40]Okay, I guess I got it.
[43:37.26]There's more over here, too.
[43:39.44]There's a lot.
[43:42.35]That was fun?
[43:43.99]No, I'm not going to get it.
[43:44.91]I'm illiterate?
[43:51.19]What do you mean I'm illiterate?
[43:54.33]Ooh, I have Giganticus.
[43:57.67]AF 18.
[43:58.11]That's new.
[43:58.83]Level 23.
[43:59.43]Cool.
[44:00.37]And Goliath D1.
[44:04.95]Let's see what that is.
[44:09.90]Goliath D1.
[44:12.28]Rocket Launcher represents the ultimate in firepower and boasts a huge blast radius.
[44:16.18]A three-time zoom scope is attached as well.
[44:18.90]Enough accuracy to serve as a solid long-range weapon.
[44:23.43]Alright, time to try the Goliath.
[44:28.35]Now, do you want me to just use the silly putty?
[44:31.69]Do you want me to get the bouncy goo?
[44:33.99]I think this is another one with...
[44:36.86]Robots.
[44:37.50]Well, I mean, do you want me to put some bouncy portal gun glue all over you so you can get healed?
[44:43.41]No.
[44:43.63]When my tank blows up, I get another one.
[44:48.35]Alright, this thing looks kind of fucking insane.
[44:51.13]I'm also using Giganticus.
[44:52.87]I'm gonna read what this says.
[44:55.41]Upgraded model with better firepower and improves guidance system.
[44:58.19]Lock on maximum, increase to 30 as well.
[44:59.95]Well, let's just try it.
[45:02.43]Making it possible to attack an entire group of enemies with just one soldier.
[45:07.28]Well, let's see how it is.
[45:17.11]Jeremy wants to put goo all over Star, confirmed.
[45:23.98]It's fun to peel glue off your hands.
[45:28.98]Holy shit!
[45:39.37]Are you kidding me?
[45:41.79]This thing is fucking crazy.
[45:49.50]Alright, I just found the best fucking gun in the game.
[45:53.47]This thing is disgusting.
[45:56.09]Alright guys, I figured out how to play EDF.
[46:00.65]This is just like a Call of Duty killstreak.
[46:04.15]This is not a Giganticus.
[46:11.62]Oh!
[46:13.68]Okay, this is a little bit gigantic-ous.
[46:15.46]Dude, Jerma, look at this.
[46:17.81]I just shot a guy in the fucking face with a rocket.
[46:24.79]Look at my tank shoot.
[46:27.25]And how much recoil there is.
[46:29.23]This thing doesn't do a whole lot of damage at all, actually.
[46:31.37]He's in his own world.
[46:32.98]I know, I really am, because this thing can't even kill a single ant.
[46:38.58]Okay.
[46:38.84]Maybe this thing isn't as great as I thought it was.
[46:40.56]But what were you saying about recoil?
[46:43.66]Nothing.
[46:47.36]I was, you know, saying words.
[46:51.13]Ooh, I like this one.
[46:55.89]Holy shit.
[46:56.59]Okay, I like both these weapons because I can go, like, A, B, C, D, E, F, G. I can get the whole alphabet and shoot.
[47:02.43]And then after I shoot the whole alphabet, bang.
[47:04.59]I like it.
[47:05.67]Each shot does 50 damage.
[47:06.73]Okay, I get it.
[47:10.58]You're gonna destroy this nest?
[47:14.40]That's a big boom.
[47:16.82]Oh, that's a big boom!
[47:19.11]That's a big boom.
[47:26.99]This goliath is sick too.
[47:32.30]See ya.
[47:34.40]Nice.
[47:35.58]Whoa.
[47:37.73]Alright, we gotta collect shit here, man.
[47:39.71]There's a lot of stuff.
[47:41.53]EDF.
[47:42.52]EDF.
[47:46.28]Can you get on top of my tank?
[47:48.72]Yes.
[47:48.88]Alright, just drive us.
[47:52.30]Will you drive us?
[47:54.40]Apparently you can't.
[47:57.75]That would be nice.
[47:58.73]Can I shoot?
[47:59.43]I can shoot this in the air, right?
[48:01.63]Yeah.
[48:03.47]Oh, that is so cool.
[48:04.49]This game is so fucking cool.
[48:08.01]It's just... cool.
[48:21.08]Oh, that makes sense.
[48:22.54]I was wondering why, uh... Class I'm playing has, like, a C4 that you have to walk up and manually place on the ground.
[48:31.38]For destroying these, that would make a lot of sense.
[48:34.90]I can do a lot of damage to the Hive with just the Goliath over and over again.
[48:38.60]It does like 600 or something damage per shot.
[48:42.12]Oh, you got damage numbers?
[48:43.18]Yeah.
[48:43.78]PPS.
[48:45.96]This is a random asshole to the left.
[48:52.24]Jeez.
[48:53.42]Quit moving around so much.
[48:55.11]I can't shoot him.
[49:00.25]I'm sorry.
[49:01.13]I think that was me that did that to you.
[49:03.61]Must have been.
[49:13.80]Excuse me.
[49:17.34]Got it.
[49:18.78]Hooray!
[49:21.61]Collect stuff.
[49:22.15]I don't know how many of these we have to destroy, but there's a bunch of stuff up there.
[49:27.17]Oh, yeah, there's another one.
[49:30.16]Let's collect.
[49:37.95]Anybody play battle tanks battle tanks battle tanks for the n64 no Yes Now we can't talk about it why cuz you haven't played it so okay, we're gonna stream that and we're sure that tonight That would not be good.
[49:57.92]It would not hold up to the test of time.
[49:59.78]I
[50:10.49]Those poor civilians.
[50:12.19]Just get the hell out of the way.
[50:13.45]I was going to be a Battle Tank pro gamer.
[50:27.12]Were you?
[50:28.36]Yeah.
[50:30.36]Well, I can't really... I don't want to shoot you and kill you accidentally, so... I'm getting out of here.
[50:36.17]This was a mistake.
[50:38.31]Hurry up and get out.
[50:39.39]I can't shoot until you leave there.
[50:40.73]Dude, what game was this?
[50:48.83]Dude, this was the old GTA.
[50:50.09]Remember where you drive and shoot yourself forward faster?
[50:52.52]Yeah.
[50:54.78]This tank shot pushes you forward so far.
[51:05.08]Lots of explosives.
[51:11.04]He dodged it.
[51:15.67]I had enough.
[51:21.41]Right now, if I had the other gun, I could heal you right now.
[51:25.35]Shouldn't we be being synergetic?
[51:29.31]Synergetic?
[51:30.79]Synergy?
[51:37.86]This Goliath is fucking great.
[51:39.54]I will never take this off.
[51:40.29]We can't walk forward to get to this thing.
[51:42.37]I might just, like, drive through.
[51:43.81]Um... Yeah, we're kind of... Hey, but didn't you say farming is easy here?
[51:49.87]I guess.
[51:57.51]I'm all about mission progress, you know what I'm saying?
[51:59.99]Can't really kill this thing alone.
[52:02.15]This gun is not great against one enemy.
[52:08.62]Oh, I'm too busy looking at him.
[52:13.25]I can't fucking shoot you.
[52:14.39]I can't shoot you.
[52:16.27]Here we go.
[52:21.77]Yeah, we're gonna move up.
[52:23.91]Can I get in the back?
[52:24.93]No, that's not that vehicle.
[52:27.63]Let's just try to go.
[52:38.51]But if I had something to heal me, this would be so much easier.
[52:41.35]Well, that's why I said maybe I'll just get that thing next time.
[52:45.37]Oh, the thing is right up here.
[52:46.61]Wait, no, is it?
[52:48.46]Alright, let's just go.
[52:49.58]Just fucking move.
[52:52.46]Oh, I blew myself up.
[52:53.44]Oh my god, I dropped a howitzer the second I came out.
[52:55.36]What?
[52:56.80]My tank blew up and I left clicked as it blew up, so I dropped the whale on top of myself.
[53:07.93]Oh, shit.
[53:13.51]Oh, boy.
[53:14.63]Why am I... What?
[53:16.34]That was weird.
[53:22.44]Son of a bitch.
[53:24.30]Oh, this is not good.
[53:27.02]Nope.
[53:31.84]They're everywhere.
[53:32.38]Oh, spiders.
[53:34.55]Spiders.
[53:36.61]No, I can't even shoot these guns.
[53:37.95]They're too close.
[53:38.71]I'm dead.
[53:41.38]You need a weapon that doesn't blow up.
[53:44.28]I was trying out these.
[53:45.50]The auto-lock-on thing is cool, but I feel like it doesn't do enough damage to justify using it right now.
[53:54.06]It's fun to use.
[54:00.13]Damn it.
[54:00.95]Why are we in sub-only mode?
[54:02.15]What happened?
[54:04.30]Everyone was trying to do the alphabet.
[54:06.49]Oh.
[54:11.59]I'm gonna keep the long range rocket and I'm gonna switch the element up.
[54:14.71]This time try not to drop a howitzer on yourself.
[54:18.76]I didn't try to.
[54:24.74]In fact, I'm just gonna switch off of that.
[54:28.02]Though it is really nice to be able to howitzer the site.
[54:33.78]You know, matter of fact... Let's go back to the acid gun, man.
[54:39.34]It's just... I like it.
[54:41.58]I like the acid gun.
[54:42.68]It's very, very versatile.
[54:44.44]It has no splash damage, no blast radius.
[54:48.16]It just melts your skin.
[54:48.96]I wish I had something that wasn't an Olympic gun, like a rifle.
[54:52.82]Because every time your mech blows up or whatever, then there's ants in your face.
[54:58.64]Why did we start doing the alphabet?
[55:00.29]Is it because I said the alphabet?
[55:05.53]That must have been going on for a while.
[55:06.93]Alright, everybody.
[55:10.39]Let's move on from the alphabet joke.
[55:12.21]I command it.
[55:14.37]I demand it.
[55:16.63]You know what that means.
[55:17.37]When Jerma demands something, it gets done.
[55:20.47]For instance, Star?
[55:22.27]Yeah?
[55:23.23]I would like a banana strawberry smoothie in 10 minutes.
[55:28.56]I'll be right back.
[55:32.15]See?
[55:40.94]It's that easy.
[55:46.00]Well, don't shoot me.
[55:47.02]Be careful.
[55:47.50]I'm in front of you.
[55:50.21]Dude, I... Fuck the fuck!
[55:53.01]Fuck your bananas, strawberries, smoothie.
[55:54.53]Now we have to start over.
[55:55.43]No, I don't.
[56:00.21]I didn't say get... Well, I hope this health pack's up here.
[56:05.87]Of course there's health packs up here.
[56:07.07]There's a million and one things.
[56:08.23]I hope this health pack's up here.
[56:09.69]Ooh, watch it.
[56:18.92]Oh, I thought I had this out.
[56:25.72]I'm so scared I'm gonna get hit.
[56:28.85]causing me much stress.
[56:31.22]Health?
[56:31.62]Thank god.
[56:42.34]Alright.
[56:42.64]I'm gonna go pick up all the health before you can get to it.
[56:44.48]That would be very, very unwise.
[56:47.03]That would be very unwise of you to do something like that.
[56:54.67]This game is a Goosebumps book.
[56:58.13]It kind of is.
[56:59.83]It would be called, like, The Day the Ants Ran Wild.
[57:03.60]By R.L.
[57:04.44]Stine.
[57:06.84]The Ants are Choose Your Destiny on page 24.
[57:11.98]Okay.
[57:13.20]Wheelbarrow?
[57:14.52]Why is it Wheelbarrow?
[57:17.46]Why are we... I thought it was Wheelbarrel Streamer, not a Wheelbarrow.
[57:23.07]But, what's cracking thanks to the thousand bits?
[57:25.13]What's up, dude?
[57:26.37]Thanks for all the entertainment.
[57:27.41]Well, thanks for sticking around and watching us shoot bugs.
[57:32.75]The bug shooters.
[57:33.66]Well, yeah.
[57:34.56]We're the two bug cleaners.
[57:37.08]How far does the range on that actually go?
[57:38.76]Not that far.
[57:42.52]But thanks a lot, dude.
[57:44.08]Alright, now I gotta... Where the fuck are you going, Ant?
[57:55.87]Saving my airstrike for over the bridge.
[57:58.65]Probably a good idea.
[58:02.61]Probably smart of you.
[58:11.78]I've seen them shoot out of the top like it's a fucking soda.
[58:15.80]It's a wheel bin.
[58:18.24]Wow, what a wheel bin streamer.
[58:21.44]It's not even the right word.
[58:22.46]Wheel bin?
[58:35.72]Jump with the Cheetos.
[58:36.20]Dude, this is... That's perfect.
[58:40.22]That's why I put this thing on.
[58:41.46]Alright, collect.
[58:48.76]Here.
[58:48.96]Actually, this is perfect.
[58:50.55]Let's go.
[58:51.95]You can use my old tank.
[58:52.85]It has no ammo.
[58:55.23]But we can just drive forward and try and get this next one.
[58:58.17]Alright.
[58:58.69]Well, let's collect this shit first.
[59:02.71]Let me know when you want me to pick up your tank.
[59:06.70]I do also want to throw up my airstrike up there.
[59:12.44]So we're just going straight in?
[59:13.80]This thing that has no more shots in it though?
[59:15.60]Yeah.
[59:16.10]Alright, let's go.
[59:19.32]Right behind you!
[59:20.13]We're just gonna barrel in.
[59:23.75]Here, let me throw my airstrike up there first.
[59:25.27]Alright, well, hurry up.
[59:27.07]Make sure you hit as many of the innocent people as possible, because that's like important, right?
[59:30.77]Okay.
[59:35.48]Just kidding, we're here to protect... Oh, I just bumped it.
[59:37.94]I thought you were driving.
[59:39.80]No, I'm waiting for the airstrike.
[59:42.59]We're going to have a tough time running in here.
[59:45.37]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[59:49.55]I need a high-level helicopter.
[59:54.28]Oh, we didn't get an item.
[60:01.42]Another item we didn't get.
[60:02.46]We missed two items so far.
[60:04.80]Where is it?
[60:06.88]Now you're all about the items.
[60:08.36]Where you going?
[60:10.45]I fucking ran into a wall.
[60:11.69]I don't know where it is.
[60:15.07]Turn the camera.
[60:16.33]Turn the camera.
[60:17.79]Where is this?
[60:18.37]That's right there.
[60:19.03]Okay.
[60:19.13]Alright.
[60:20.34]I kind of want to stay.
[60:21.46]Yeah, it's right there.
[60:22.16]I want to like stay in this.
[60:23.72]I'm scared.
[60:24.10]I'm going to like, you know, we're getting out an acid gun.
[60:34.91]This is why I brought it.
[60:36.03]This is why I brought it.
[60:39.35]You're talking about a reason to bring an item.
[60:41.23]This is the reason why I brought it.
[60:43.29]I'm gonna die.
[60:54.54]I'm never gonna die.
[60:55.86]I'm immortal.
[60:58.05]This gun is fucking perfect.
[60:59.19]Hey chat, remind me, never ever take this thing off ever again.
[61:03.90]Even if you get like a level 40?
[61:06.94]What if you get a higher level squirt gun?
[61:09.22]Oh, of course then, yeah.
[61:11.71]Alright, we gotta move up and start to destroy that thing.
[61:14.05]I'm just trying to kill enough ants so I can get another tank.
[61:31.63]Falling in another tank.
[61:36.68]It's just so perfect.
[61:37.50]It's like the perfect amount of medium range and it staggers them so they can't attack you.
[61:43.06]When they get sprayed by the spritzer, they go like... Alright, you got your tank?
[61:59.52]Ready to start destroying shit?
[62:10.46]Oh, sorry building Woo that is the point when one of us has to go That is the part of the movie where that would happen Let's get up there
[62:35.47]They're blocking my line of sight!
[62:36.69]I need covering fire!
[62:43.96]I threw an airstrike up there, back up.
[62:48.38]It takes a while, but... I know.
[62:49.98]Oh god!
[62:50.44]It's still like right next to me.
[62:57.13]Got it.
[62:58.73]Oh!
[62:59.01]Oh!
[62:59.59]Items!
[62:59.89]Get the stuff, get the stuff!
[63:01.57]Oh!
[63:01.99]No, we still got more.
[63:03.01]We got more to do.
[63:04.65]Really?
[63:05.55]I guess, yeah.
[63:05.97]I'm sure that'd be the last one.
[63:07.43]Well, we get a breather.
[63:12.63]Nice job, nice job.
[63:13.79]That could have gone real wrong.
[63:15.21]I like the strat where we take the tanks up.
[63:17.97]It's a good strategy.
[63:19.73]Well, this time... Okay, can I call in another tank?
[63:22.09]Yeah, okay.
[63:22.75]We're gonna both go in tanks.
[63:23.89]My tank still has ammo in it.
[63:25.21]Okay.
[63:25.89]You got full health?
[63:28.11]Yeah.
[63:29.61]We missed a bunch of shit back there.
[63:30.75]It was like at least two items.
[63:31.79]You wanna go back and get it or no?
[63:33.03]No.
[63:34.61]They're just going to be the same level 20 things, probably.
[63:37.05]Alright, well.
[63:38.25]Alright, where you going?
[63:39.25]This thing still has a couple shots in it.
[63:41.35]Yeah, that's what I said.
[63:42.31]Jesus.
[63:42.83]There's like the actual scary spiders now.
[63:46.29]Oh, man.
[63:50.17]This is actually going to be probably pretty difficult.
[63:53.40]Well, I'll get another airstrike eventually.
[63:56.06]And then we'll bomb it.
[63:58.00]Oh, jeez, there's so many.
[63:58.94]Yeah, I would just... Uh-oh.
[64:02.26]Hold on.
[64:02.84]There's silly string everywhere.
[64:04.38]Hold on, I'm running into debris.
[64:08.12]They're wrapping around the right side.
[64:10.92]They're flanking us.
[64:11.79]They are.
[64:12.75]Watch my back.
[64:15.09]Got it.
[64:16.35]I'll get this one on the right.
[64:17.41]Don't worry.
[64:18.55]Got it.
[64:20.07]I'll get the one on the left over here.
[64:22.43]Ooh, he wanted me to take his picture.
[64:26.52]He was ready for me to take the picture.
[64:28.58]Do it, take it now, quick, when I'm in my action shot!
[64:32.04]Well, I took it.
[64:33.66]Oh, I see the hole up there.
[64:36.37]I wanna get that.
[64:36.97]I wish cities didn't have so much, so many obstacles, you know what I mean?
[64:40.41]Yeah, I know.
[64:40.83]Like, there's a bunch of trees, like, just stop, like, give us a line of sight.
[64:52.50]How far up?
[64:52.98]I see where it is, yeah.
[64:56.58]Oh, hold on.
[64:57.34]We got it.
[65:07.14]Yeah.
[65:07.50]Uh-oh.
[65:10.30]What do you mean, uh-oh?
[65:11.77]My tank's gone.
[65:12.83]Take mine.
[65:13.53]Right behind you.
[65:19.75]Oh, that's not good.
[65:20.97]I'm grabbed.
[65:25.74]Who has me?
[65:29.20]I gotta back up.
[65:30.06]Jeez.
[65:30.54]There's health back here, too.
[65:32.10]We have to fall back until... See, they totally spawn enough for four people.
[65:37.33]Yeah.
[65:38.47]You get that.
[65:39.05]How are you on health?
[65:39.75]Are you, like, actually healed?
[65:43.69]Or how are you doing?
[65:45.41]Good.
[65:45.71]I'm summoning another tank.
[65:48.87]Goddamn, there's so many of them.
[65:51.71]There's so many of them.
[65:52.67]Asshead!
[65:53.65]Asshead's gonna save.
[65:54.31]I'm gonna back.
[66:00.79]Holy shit, dude.
[66:01.61]It's just like fucking lasers everywhere.
[66:03.17]Where's the health?
[66:04.07]Come on.
[66:04.25]I'm going in.
[66:04.93]I'm going in.
[66:05.33]They're all after you.
[66:05.89]I'm going in.
[66:07.35]Actually, my tank's about to blow up.
[66:13.17]I did not know he was right here.
[66:16.03]I'm going to go around the right.
[66:17.18]Fuck this.
[66:17.50]I'm wrapping around.
[66:18.60]I'm going to die.
[66:20.04]You're going to die?
[66:20.48]This is it.
[66:22.74]This is it for me.
[66:23.54]Are you sure?
[66:26.72]Oh, this isn't for me.
[66:27.59]No, no, no, just stay alive.
[66:30.21]I'm covering you back.
[66:34.49]I might have very strong items.
[66:37.03]Fuck.
[66:39.05]What is the guy saying on the audio?
[66:40.91]Did I get it?
[66:41.63]I have no idea, but we're so like... Oh, this is bad, bad, bad.
[66:51.14]Real bad, I'm dead.
[66:56.12]God.
[66:56.70]I did not get it.
[66:59.23]There's a... Yeah, this is like... This is so fucking crazy.
[67:04.73]There's so many of them.
[67:07.71]We played that very well, too.
[67:09.37]That's the problem.
[67:10.49]That's the thing that sucks.
[67:11.23]Now, you want to know what the problem is?
[67:13.13]I think... We don't have any way to get around them to actually get to it.
[67:16.89]Because we're just both going down the main street.
[67:18.75]Like, if I was Fly Girl and in the back bombing it, it'd be fine.
[67:24.18]Or if I had a helicopter, which I won't get ever, apparently.
[67:31.71]Those guys... No, I like this, but I like the loadout I already have.
[67:36.87]It's good for when they get in close.
[67:38.23]Just do what you're doing.
[67:39.61]And I'm going to be Fly Girl and we'll do it.
[67:44.18]Easy peasy.
[67:45.98]Should we both be Fly Girl?
[67:47.16]Would that be better?
[67:47.72]I mean, obviously...
[67:50.16]Because as long as you're killing them in the front, and I can go over top of them and shoot it while you're fighting them, it's fine.
[67:55.82]Okay.
[67:59.05]Hey, Raidbot, thanks for the 12 months.
[68:00.89]They say, hey, Star!
[68:02.89]And Jerva, so glad to see you stream together.
[68:05.27]Well, thanks for the 12 months, dude.
[68:09.79]Appreciate it.
[68:11.71]This mission was long and hard, so we need to focus here.
[68:23.96]Like already this feels like it's going a lot faster just because I flew straight over and started bombing it Yeah as they were coming out.
[68:39.23]I Think we'll be good this time
[68:46.60]How did that happen?
[68:49.04]That went right through there.
[68:50.45]I don't think that's even fucking possible.
[68:52.35]There's some armor that we didn't get.
[68:59.21]Whatever, screw it.
[69:04.85]Watch out!
[69:09.61]I just saw like a huge amount of them just fly in the air.
[69:12.31]I probably killed like 30 with that.
[69:16.05]What the fuck?
[69:16.85]Get out of the way!
[69:18.09]Stupid fucking civilians!
[69:20.73]I just shot a fucking... It's like, why would you... Why are you walking in front of me?
[69:26.25]Get off the street!
[69:28.64]You fucking idiot.
[69:31.14]You blew up their home.
[69:32.48]No, it's like... Let me run in front of the guy with the fucking giant rocket launcher.
[69:37.38]That's a great idea.
[69:41.25]Sorry, soldier.
[69:42.09]Yeah, see how much faster this is going?
[69:44.52]Yeah, because you can just fly right over it.
[69:50.65]Yeah, let me get some of these health packs.
[69:59.43]Shoot him dead.
[70:00.35]It's too bad.
[70:01.05]I thought we beat it after the third one up here.
[70:03.77]Because we had a lot of items that round because how many we killed.
[70:07.58]Blow up what?
[70:09.00]Blow up the tower to the right?
[70:10.74]This thing?
[70:11.10]Oh shit.
[70:14.86]Oh my god.
[70:18.16]That is not structurally sound.
[70:20.95]That's not... Alright, that happened.
[70:31.30]That was crazy.
[70:34.68]I think a civilian just told me to eat this bullet.
[70:38.97]You sure it wasn't an EDF guy saying, eat this bullet?
[70:41.79]Well, the guy ran by me was just like, eat this bullet.
[70:51.98]Hmm, Earth Defense Force.
[70:59.31]Acid Gun.
[71:06.91]I love this thing.
[71:07.43]When are we going to get the Ranger's support?
[71:10.09]They can fly.
[71:10.91]I need to... Dude, do you give me another Super Soaker like this?
[71:17.52]I'm sure there's at least three or four more slots that I don't have in the Super Soaker category, too.
[71:21.16]I'm looking forward to that.
[71:29.60]You should see this laser gun I'm using.
[71:31.48]Like super soakers.
[71:32.52]What turned you into a murdering buckethead acid gun dumbhead?
[71:37.19]Yeah, I don't know what the buckethead's about.
[71:38.61]I don't either.
[71:39.23]Why?
[71:39.37]I don't get it.
[71:39.99]Is it like a thing from EDF?
[71:40.81]Do they say that?
[71:41.97]Are they like, ah, you buckethead?
[71:43.23]I don't know.
[71:46.55]It couldn't be my buckethead story.
[71:49.27]That story's boring.
[71:50.23]Alright, destroy the hive.
[71:58.02]It's dead.
[71:59.61]This is going way more smoothly.
[72:01.23]You being able to go over on top and shoot it from above is so much better.
[72:04.39]Yeah, we had no way of getting to it before.
[72:06.95]Because my tank, like, one shot every couple of seconds was killing.
[72:10.28]We just couldn't get forward.
[72:15.70]Any more items?
[72:16.43]Yeah, there's armor over here.
[72:21.77]Now I think it's just the one guy calling you a buckethead and we just keep looking over and seeing that and in chat This one guy gets calling us bucket heads, and I see it every time I look over So funny how much further up you are I'm like running around getting items and you're just like yeah, I'm at the next one Now here we go this is the difficult part
[73:00.03]Get out of the way, you fucking dumb civilian guy.
[73:03.87]I don't want to shoot you in the face accidentally and kill us all.
[73:10.90]Where is he?
[73:14.14]Who's inside that building?
[73:20.34]Alright, they're kind of wrapping around me on the left here.
[73:22.64]I'm a little bit scared at the moment.
[73:27.25]How are you doing?
[73:28.61]I am halfway, probably almost destroyed it.
[73:30.91]That kind of jumped way ahead of you and came over here.
[73:38.58]Nah, you'd be surprised how many I've killed coming ahead of it.
[73:43.60]Well, there's at least like seven or eight that just went all the way around.
[73:46.35]I got it, it's down.
[73:48.27]Alright, we need item.
[73:56.27]I'm totally okay being item collection boy right now.
[74:00.15]I'm coming back to grab stuff.
[74:02.95]What is left?
[74:03.39]Oh, there's only like four of them left.
[74:08.15]There's one way behind us.
[74:17.12]Careful, you're blowing hell.
[74:19.22]Yeah, there's only one more.
[74:20.86]The last bug.
[74:23.45]Mmm, get stuff, get stuff, get money, get money, money, money.
[74:26.21]You know what I liked about that mission?
[74:28.63]What?
[74:29.57]We failed it once, and we realized, you know, we came up with a strategy, and the mission was actually defeatable.
[74:36.33]Yeah.
[74:37.73]And there wasn't just a thousand things in here.
[74:41.35]We're just like your item collector, ResidentSleeper.
[74:48.70]Come on, world's first.

[76:41.38]I see him in like every stream.
[76:42.62]Did you just alt-tab to do that?
[76:44.46]Yeah.
[76:45.56]Holy shit.
[76:46.16]Oh my god.
[76:46.80]Is that just its face?
[76:52.40]Oh my god, this is crazy.
[76:54.14]I'm so scared right now.
[76:55.64]Can I get it?
[76:56.32]Is that your tank?
[76:58.38]No, I can get one of those, but no.
[77:00.99]Holy shit.
[77:02.75]Oh my god, I don't know what to do.
[77:05.77]Should I shoot him?
[77:12.26]Do we have to shoot inside of it?
[77:14.24]How do I shoot this gun?
[77:20.48]Okay, I just shot that... What?
[77:22.78]Where is it going?
[77:24.98]Where is it going?
[77:25.60]Oh, it's a javelin.
[77:26.30]It goes straight up then comes down.
[77:27.52]Oh my god.
[77:28.30]This is crazy.
[77:36.50]Can we not shoot it?
[77:38.76]I'm just fucking watching it.
[77:40.55]It's gonna hit him.
[77:43.46]Holy shit, dude.
[77:44.74]This is insane.
[77:47.40]I'm gonna get crushed by his fucking foot!
[77:49.16]I'm too- Oh my god.
[77:54.48]Oh my god.
[77:57.42]Okay, I'm not fast enough to get away.
[77:59.34]I didn't know it was just gonna keep walking forward.
[78:03.40]It's too slow.
[78:04.28]I shouldn't have put out the Aston Gun.
[78:11.24]He just walks forward.
[78:14.49]I mean, he didn't step on you, I guess, or did he?
[78:17.87]No.
[78:21.27]Come rescue me.
[78:22.15]Where are we supposed to shoot him?
[78:24.43]Like, right in his mouth?
[78:28.57]Probably.
[78:28.99]Fucking acid gun.
[78:31.49]I didn't know I... I have nothing to lock onto.
[78:41.32]I'll just corrode his leg.
[78:46.81]This thing is fucking awesome.
[78:49.07]Do I have an opportunity here?
[78:50.03]They're saying that an aircraft is coming with a new weapon to shoot at this thing.
[78:55.95]Really?
[78:58.31]This thing is just running buildings over.
[79:00.66]They said do something until then, but I don't know what... I don't know either.
[79:06.48]Oh, shit.
[79:08.60]He's dropping shit right now.
[79:12.76]This weapon is not the thing I needed right now.
[79:18.45]I'll get that guy.
[79:20.81]I'll get that guy, maybe.
[79:22.07]Here it comes.
[79:25.65]Get him.
[79:30.59]Oh, this thing is not good for right here.
[79:36.76]Yeah, I thought it was going to come kill me too.
[79:38.84]It's really cool, but unless I can... It's not really that great.
[79:44.46]It takes us so long to shoot it.
[79:48.00]My thing is completely out of ammo.
[79:50.16]I have this and the acid gun.
[79:53.36]All I can do is watch my thing fly around.
[80:02.79]I really think we're supposed to be shooting in it, and there's no way either of us can do it.
[80:05.77]Eat this!
[80:10.89]Uh-oh.
[80:18.64]I don't think it has a target to lock onto anymore.
[80:20.92]What does that mean?
[80:21.44]Does it not fall?
[80:23.10]No, it just shoots into space.
[80:26.66]Alright.
[80:29.66]I just... Okay, maybe if I get in front of this thing, I can lock onto his belly.
[80:32.32]You know what I'm saying?
[80:35.56]To get, like, under it.
[80:36.52]Yeah, so I'm gonna... Can I get on top of your tank or something?
[80:39.22]No, you're not in the tank.
[80:41.36]He's opening right now.
[80:42.94]This is what I'm talking about.
[80:43.72]Watch this one.
[80:47.43]No.
[80:50.24]I'm gonna get this.
[80:50.92]I'm gonna win.
[80:53.66]I'm gonna be the guy that people talk about when they look at EDF streams.
[81:11.21]He's just telling us to clean up the enemies.
[81:21.76]You got stepped on again?
[81:23.16]No, I got fucking... I just... My loadout is useless right now.
[81:27.50]I hope you can kill everything.
[81:30.78]I thought mine was useless.
[81:32.24]I have the super rocket and the acid gun because I never took it off.
[81:39.90]This weapon loadout is making me cringe.
[81:43.86]Well, I just wanted to try the rocket launcher.
[81:46.55]And then I was not supposed to... Don't worry, we're going to be fine.
[81:48.53]Don't worry.
[81:49.92]Are we?
[81:50.12]Yeah, because you're going to come... I'm right here.
[81:52.86]I didn't have to get the one hit on the boss.
[82:02.66]That matters.
[82:03.08]Yeah, apparently the boss doesn't matter.
[82:07.39]Well, it's still cool.
[82:15.79]Yeah.
[82:17.75]I can at least try to do something with my acid.
[82:23.07]Any health packs?
[82:23.81]A couple right here.
[82:31.43]Destroy the Hector.
[82:32.35]This takes so long to shoot this fucking gun and I'm standing still this whole time.
[82:39.95]Is it even gonna hit him?
[82:45.65]It didn't even kill him!
[82:47.30]No, it did, thank god.
[82:48.16]I was gonna say, that's such bullshit if it didn't.
[82:52.76]Actually, now this thing is gonna shine.
[82:54.88]Because these guys actually take a lot of damage.
[83:00.17]Fuck, I thought I had it right there.
[83:02.19]DDF is just singing over here.
[83:03.33]I need health.
[83:13.55]Ow, my shoulder.
[83:14.35]I actually don't even know what attacks these guys do because they're so slow and shitty.
[83:18.77]I know, really.
[83:19.09]Whoever designed these is an idiot.
[83:25.68]Oh, shit.
[83:26.12]That's coming around quick.
[83:27.62]Nice.
[83:27.94]Alright.
[83:29.00]Yeah, it takes like two or three shots for this.
[83:32.10]You know what I was trying to say.
[83:34.44]You know what I meant to say, and that's what I was saying.
[83:38.18]Whoa.
[83:39.32]What was that?
[83:40.64]Did you just do that?
[83:42.06]What?
[83:44.77]No, I don't want to shoot the guy in the back.
[83:47.07]Oh, fuck it.
[83:47.49]Whatever.
[83:50.93]They're closing in on me.
[83:51.69]I've got to back the hell up.
[83:55.96]These are seriously the lamest enemies.
[83:58.38]It's too bad because they're huge and cool looking.
[84:01.40]Good thing I shot the guy all the way in the back row.
[84:03.16]Okay.
[84:16.38]Health?
[84:18.06]No.
[84:20.12]I'm shooting the guy in the back again.
[84:21.12]Fuck it.
[84:26.89]The Prominence M1.
[84:27.93]Oh, he doesn't care about me anymore.
[84:38.21]I love when you hit them that hard, their whole body just jerks to one side.
[84:47.98]That should kill him.
[84:48.64]Uh-oh.
[84:49.76]What do you mean, uh-oh?
[84:50.82]I'm summoning my mech right in the walk path of this thing.
[84:53.58]And these guys are walking forward.
[84:59.06]Come on, die already.
[85:00.30]There we go.
[85:04.59]Alright, this guy's gonna die there.
[85:05.69]Oh, dude, you... Alright, looks like you're in a little bit of trouble.
[85:11.59]Oh, shit.
[85:13.05]That's not good.
[85:15.51]Oh, fuck.
[85:16.78]No.
[85:17.06]No.
[85:19.07]Not good.
[85:21.07]I'm gonna get overwhelmed here.
[85:25.06]Oh, did they just do the summon everything?
[85:26.92]Yeah, they summoned a fucking trillion of these things.
[85:31.58]I just got my mech.
[85:38.17]Thankfully they're not...
[85:41.89]Fucking acid gun.
[85:42.79]What the fuck do I have this on for?
[85:44.99]God damn it.
[85:45.95]I feel like I'm playing Super Mario Sunshine right now.
[85:50.92]Hey, it's the boss fight.
[85:51.68]You gotta have your acid gun.
[86:03.74]This has to be the last wave.
[86:04.88]I'm killing this guy.
[86:09.30]Come on!
[86:16.55]I'm just, like, mildly irritating this guy.
[86:20.30]Why is that, like, fucking him up so much?
[86:24.64]Oh, for the love of God.
[86:25.52]Okay, I killed an enemy with my acid gun.
[86:31.80]And that guy just tripped in front of me.
[86:32.90]That's good.
[86:34.14]Holy shit.
[86:34.64]I did it.
[86:35.18]Fuck.
[86:36.64]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[86:39.34]Fuck.
[86:39.92]Fuck.
[86:40.72]Fuck.
[86:41.24]He's right there, dude.
[86:42.40]He's right behind us.
[86:44.38]I know.
[86:45.60]I'm dead.
[86:53.40]We did it!
[86:54.58]We did it!
[86:54.90]Don't die, don't die!
[86:55.70]Stay alive!
[86:58.58]I'm 13 health.
[87:05.56]I got four armor, we didn't pick up anything, because we were in a constant backpedal of we can't do anything.
[87:11.59]Get carried.
[87:13.45]Get carried.
[87:14.47]Get carried by the guy just walking forward.
[87:20.37]Dammit.
[87:20.75]Alright.
[87:21.57]Get... I need to take this thing off.
[87:24.37]No, not select a mission.
[87:26.01]No, I'm not ready.
[87:27.83]We have to destroy a transport ship in this one, so have something that can hit it.
[87:31.90]Alright, I'm just going to put on the tried and true loadout.
[87:35.54]It's the one that works.
[87:36.88]Stingray M2, Goliath D1, Acid Gun.
[87:42.34]EDF, EDF.
[87:42.96]Ha ha ha.
[87:48.97]How do we have a 1% completion rate?
[87:53.44]Is this game that huge?
[87:55.18]Yeah.
[87:57.10]It is.
[88:03.17]I'm upset at coffee.
[88:05.39]It's 10 o'clock at night and I'm drinking coffee.
[88:07.05]What am I thinking?
[88:11.28]Yeah, well, no acid?
[88:12.34]No, the acid gun's on there.
[88:13.06]What are you talking about?
[88:16.05]But why acid gun?
[88:16.87]Because, like, 9 out of 10 times, that thing is amazing.
[88:20.05]It's only when you have to shoot 100 ships floating around.
[88:27.49]I got my Goliath D1.
[88:28.70]I'm fine.
[88:29.00]Don't worry.
[88:31.68]Are you going to be able to destroy the guys?
[88:33.78]Because if I'm not flying around, I'm not going to be doing it like I did last time.
[88:38.22]I have the Goliath.
[88:39.62]I don't know if a tank could aim up that high.
[88:42.56]Yeah, I have the Goliath.
[88:43.82]I have my super rocket launcher.
[88:45.06]That's good.
[88:46.87]Should I?
[88:47.19]Hold on.
[88:48.10]Wait.
[88:48.98]I'm sorry, guys.
[88:50.46]But I'm gonna have to go against what I was doing.
[88:54.36]You guys are gonna talk all this shit about me, and I'm sorry.
[88:56.52]But I gotta put on something else.
[88:59.31]The acid gun ain't gonna cut it here.
[89:01.49]It just isn't.
[89:06.69]I said he was never gonna switch it, but you know what?
[89:08.49]It's okay.
[89:14.61]Wonder if that are we gonna get more of those stupid planes ship things Potentially because I feel like this thing would be unbelievable versus those so I'm gonna put yeah guys acid guns gone Fucking worst gun in the game.
[89:27.10]I imagine ants out of transport Transport ship
[89:44.78]uh quit the game why just do it that was the that was the wrong thing it was the I wanted is this thing okay go ahead
[90:15.13]Wrong gun.
[90:22.43]Can I blow it up now?
[90:23.26]I think I can.
[90:28.66]One more!
[90:29.40]Ooh, I got it!
[90:30.08]Is that enough?
[90:31.74]No, I'll get it next time.
[90:32.96]No, it takes a lot of shots.
[90:40.66]Is it too far away right now?
[90:47.41]Tell me when they open.
[90:48.29]It's hard for me to look.
[90:52.91]There it is.
[90:53.37]I like one more.
[91:01.70]Die!
[91:03.86]There it is.
[91:07.22]That does so much damage.
[91:08.52]That works.
[91:09.75]Yeah, the Goliath is an awesome weapon too.
[91:12.19]It just does a ton of explosion damage.
[91:23.99]Kill this one straggler behind us, it's coming for me.
[91:31.92]It's opening.
[91:40.40]Where is it?
[91:46.77]I gotta be careful, I might shoot you right in the back here.
[91:51.83]Nice.
[91:52.81]When we focus on that together, it just goes down in one setting.
[91:57.43]These giant mechs just... Are giant mechs.
[92:01.56]That can't move.
[92:03.40]So, they're too dim.
[92:11.24]Dude.
[92:12.23]This is... Wow!
[92:13.57]A lot of items we need to get here.
[92:17.41]There's so many items that just spread throughout this whole area.
[92:19.69]I...
[92:21.15]I think they said there was another transport ship coming.
[92:24.79]There's one spider over here.
[92:25.81]I don't even just let him be an asshole and don't die to it, I guess.
[92:31.09]I don't think that must be the last one.
[92:32.93]Multi launcher is sick.
[92:33.69]Yeah, no, even in a lot of situations... This is the situation where this thing is amazing.
[92:38.07]Because when there's like a hundred of them that just collide, just go... Okay.
[92:42.67]I'm just fucking hurting myself now.
[92:45.77]See, he's gonna die.
[92:46.73]He's getting too close.
[92:50.31]And everything else is really hard to get.
[92:53.68]Yeah, fuck it.
[92:58.78]Hide in the valley.
[92:59.70]Oh, here it comes.
[93:02.42]Is there more than one?
[93:03.64]Oh, we have to go down.
[93:04.38]Is it fall damage?
[93:07.48]I don't know.
[93:08.16]Oh, boy.
[93:12.89]Thank God.
[93:14.93]For a second, I was like, we're both going to die.
[93:17.47]We're going to get two Dark Souls screams.
[93:21.24]Where the hell is this thing?
[93:23.74]Finally, it's gonna pass over the valley.
[93:25.42]It's right here.
[93:29.48]And... Oh, it's coming from this way.
[93:31.54]From where I am.
[93:32.84]Huh?
[93:33.84]From where I am.
[93:34.36]It's coming this direction.
[93:35.26]Oh, there's two of them.
[93:35.96]Yeah, there's one flying right over right now.
[93:38.80]There's two of them.
[93:40.07]I know, but which one do you want to focus on?
[93:41.43]Because we've got to pick one.
[93:42.27]The one above us right now?
[93:44.85]Whichever one I can aim at.
[93:46.45]Which one can you aim at?
[93:48.21]I'm so slow.
[93:50.29]It's going to have to be this one.
[93:53.89]Oh, shit.
[94:02.14]It's dead already.
[94:04.31]Oh, I can't see anything.
[94:06.25]My mech got destroyed by spiders.
[94:07.73]I can't see anything.
[94:12.31]I hope you're okay over there.
[94:15.07]No.
[94:16.39]No.
[94:18.35]I'm trying to just cover the hell out of everything.
[94:22.79]Shit, he's above.
[94:23.51]You fucking little sneaky shithead.
[94:26.16]Why do you have to be right here?
[94:29.22]Why?
[94:29.50]You didn't even need to be there, you cheater.
[94:35.52]We got to get over to the other one it's gonna start opening now That one's still alive There's also pretty neat mission, yeah, I like this one is it open it's opening I sneak one in there I think so
[95:05.51]Whoa whoa easy easy Sorry if I'm gaming too hard for you try and keep up why there's always one behind us.
[95:29.98]Oh
[95:32.19]For some dumb reason.
[95:33.33]How's your health?
[95:34.91]Good.
[95:35.43]Oh, it's open.
[95:37.46]Is it?
[95:37.82]Shit, I'm not near it.
[95:47.50]Ah, fuck.
[95:49.54]Uh, by the end of this I can get another mech.
[95:53.78]There was one behind us and I just focused too much on it.
[95:59.79]If you focus too much on it, maybe it'd be dead.
[96:02.49]No, no, no.
[96:03.05]The spider, they drop behind us.
[96:09.45]That's what I mean.
[96:11.35]It killed it.
[96:15.01]It's gonna be dead right here.
[96:16.45]No sweat.
[96:20.35]Watch out.
[96:20.73]I don't want to kill you with this.
[96:25.47]Item collection.
[96:26.41]Item collection.
[96:30.61]Come at the item collection.
[96:38.92]Oh, there's a lot of cool weapons.
[96:43.28]Did you get it?
[96:43.76]Come on.
[96:46.24]We're getting them.
[96:58.13]I would have had it.
[96:58.87]Oh shit, I thought you got it.
[97:04.81]Fuck.
[97:05.18]I'm sorry.
[97:09.62]You must have been pixels away from touching it.
[97:12.50]I was.
[97:16.82]No noosh.
[97:19.32]We gotta destroy Hectors.
[97:21.54]Why are they called Hectors?
[97:22.88]I don't know.
[97:24.84]Who knows.
[97:28.05]But thank you, Mexican Tea Radio.
[97:30.19]Mexican Radio.
[97:31.25]Put this up.
[97:33.06]X10 and X for 500 bits.
[97:34.90]Do I like superhero or Marvel movies?
[97:37.42]If so, have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy trailer?
[97:41.46]I am a fan of superhero movies.
[97:44.04]Although I haven't seen any of the Captain America movies, and I'm a piece of crap for that.
[97:47.22]But yes, I do like them.
[97:52.23]I'm going to keep this loadout.
[97:56.45]But, no, I'm a fan.
[97:57.49]I like, um... I love Batman.
[97:59.73]Batman.
[98:00.11]Like, the Chris Nolan Batman is some of my favorite movies.
[98:02.17]So... And again, Mexican Radio for the 250 Bits.
[98:05.63]Say hi to Star for me.
[98:06.61]Well, Mexican Radio says hello.
[98:12.05]Okay, if you're curious... Oh, God!
[98:13.81]What?
[98:14.65]What did you do?
[98:23.90]See I told you they just go oh god, I can't believe see it's fucking stupid you're starting I wanted to make that point again oh Shit, there's they're attacking the beach run to the guys with the guns First out the mission did you shoot yourself?
[98:42.32]I did I did the practice I wanted to show what we're talking about again to make sure people understand
[98:50.87]Good job.
[98:51.15]I wanna see the walking fortress.
[98:53.81]See, it doesn't just happen to me.
[98:55.31]It happens to a seasoned gaming veteran like Star.
[99:03.74]I feel like it's gonna happen again unironically this time.
[99:07.34]Yeah, see?
[99:08.78]It's gonna happen, I know it.
[99:10.60]I'm just walking forward.
[99:11.70]Just get the fuck away from me, you dumbass civilians.
[99:22.98]Should we just focus on one together?
[99:24.94]Make this easier.
[99:25.46]Okay, shoot the one on the front.
[99:28.62]That everyone else is shooting.
[99:30.37]With the giant, like, water lance.
[99:33.23]Yeah, that thing's cool looking.
[99:36.43]Alright, one behind him.
[99:38.11]Oh, who's closer?
[99:38.63]Oh, the guy on the right.
[99:39.85]The guy on the right's, like, a little closer, I think.
[99:42.63]I don't know if I'm actually gonna get to try walking fortress this level.
[99:49.64]Oh, there'll probably be more.
[99:53.78]Little combat.
[99:55.78]What?
[99:56.50]Did that go by his shoulder?
[100:00.64]Guy on the other way to the left.
[100:06.67]Is there a girl you love?
[100:08.69]Then win!
[100:09.93]I'm motivated.
[100:15.23]The next guy on the left.
[100:16.81]Shooting the cool arcing plasma purple.
[100:31.29]Goliath.
[100:32.92]Whoa.
[100:33.42]That just kind of scared me.
[100:39.04]I love how they get really disoriented.
[100:40.20]They're not sure where they're going, and they just shoot in a random direction.
[100:43.50]Guy in the middle?
[100:44.06]Yeah.
[100:46.66]Alright.
[100:47.68]One more.
[100:49.46]Too bad that all these items we're not going to be able to get.
[100:51.52]Is it dead?
[100:57.55]There's so much fire in the way, I can't tell.
[100:58.95]No.
[101:04.53]God fucking damn it.
[101:06.87]Get out of the fucking way.
[101:10.57]There's the unironic one.
[101:16.19]I'm gonna stand like over here.
[101:18.49]God damn it, man.
[101:20.56]And this is even more coming.
[101:22.04]I'm swimming for it.
[101:22.98]I want some of those items.
[101:23.84]There's so many of them.
[101:24.70]Can you go in the water and do that?
[101:28.27]You just can't shoot.
[101:29.75]Oh, these guys are shooting some mortars.
[101:39.00]Can I not get them?
[101:41.94]I'm not sure I can even get them.
[101:43.28]Oh, please come back.
[101:43.96]No, it's not happening.
[101:53.27]You're the fucking Megazord from Power Rangers.
[101:55.49]Did you just do an emote?
[101:56.97]What are you doing?
[101:59.75]Oh my god, that's insane.
[102:01.01]I thought I would have guns.
[102:04.95]Yo, go get him.
[102:06.23]Go get him.
[102:06.63]I'm going to get him.
[102:07.45]Get him.
[102:08.96]Come on.
[102:11.44]Holy shit.
[102:14.50]These kaiju are no chance.
[102:16.78]It's Pacific Rim.
[102:18.74]Go be the rim.
[102:20.42]Go punch them.
[102:21.62]I am the rim.
[102:23.37]You're just... This is so useless for this mission.
[102:31.59]You're just like a huge target.
[102:33.97]I have 50,000 health.
[102:37.30]I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[102:39.56]If you can just get to them and punch them to death, each one.
[102:48.24]Get him!
[102:48.99]Punch him!
[102:56.23]I don't even know how much damage I'm doing.
[102:58.83]It's hard to tell.
[102:59.67]I'm just having fun watching this movie.
[103:07.03]This is so stupid.
[103:12.72]You're just missing.
[103:13.46]You're swinging too high.
[103:14.56]You're just punching him in the face accidentally sometimes.
[103:18.80]Your guy's just like scooping his hands back and forth.
[103:21.88]There you go.
[103:23.95]Oh shit, I gotta start, like, attacking.
[103:28.63]No, I can't watch the movie anymore.
[103:30.05]I have to actually shoot things.
[103:33.69]Am I here for your amusement?
[103:35.19]Oh, that was crazy.
[103:36.15]So what?
[103:36.63]What is it, take like a thousand credits or something to build that?
[103:40.36]It took us killing all those first Hectors to be able to create it.
[103:42.92]That thing is crazy.
[103:46.58]According to the description of this guy, it said it's one of the smaller walking fortresses.
[103:54.52]That's a small one.
[103:56.12]Yeah.
[103:57.08]Do you get bigger ones later?
[103:59.22]I would assume.
[103:59.78]That's... Okay, you just knocked that guy to fucking hell.
[104:03.18]I hope he's dead.
[104:03.78]Yeah, he is.
[104:08.89]There's all... Seriously, I don't understand.
[104:10.45]There are cannons...
[104:12.32]On my hips.
[104:14.50]Shoot.
[104:15.20]You have taken so much damage too.
[104:18.18]That's crazy.
[104:19.50]You've inhaled.
[104:20.12]I've taken 20,000 damage so far.
[104:22.94]I have 350.
[104:23.20]There's essentially like 30 of me standing on that thing.
[104:33.09]Oh no, like 300 of me.
[104:35.83]What is math?
[104:36.90]What is this?
[104:37.24]What is math?
[104:38.10]What is violence?
[104:39.54]Stop doing that.
[104:40.36]I did that already last night.
[104:47.50]Are there any button controls?
[104:50.02]Besides punch and lock?
[104:52.12]You can use the guns.
[104:53.84]I've pressed every button that I would think you'd be pressing.
[104:56.81]I think there's only like one thing left.
[105:01.35]Shift space.
[105:05.73]30.
[105:07.45]NA math.
[105:08.43]Well, I am from North America.
[105:09.55]I'm kidding.
[105:11.77]I shouldn't even be fighting right now.
[105:13.81]It's just a spectacle watching.
[105:17.10]Why does this game look like so much fun?
[105:18.78]Well, I think that's because it is so much fun.
[105:22.62]Hold on.
[105:23.04]Let me... That poor guy is trying to hurt you and he's not going to be able to.
[105:35.53]Wheel click wasn't doing anything.
[105:37.47]Left shift in space.
[105:38.75]Yeah, the stomps aren't doing anything on this one.
[105:40.37]Alright, well, I think I know what I need to do.
[105:54.29]No one's even helping me.
[105:55.25]Yeah, because...
[106:02.52]Excuse me.
[106:03.75]We are helping.
[106:07.19]You tell me this is not helping while you kill the bad guys?
[106:13.03]Who's shooting me in the back?
[106:15.35]Not us.
[106:15.79]I can guarantee you that.
[106:20.85]High five!
[106:21.63]Yeah!
[106:22.03]Nice job!
[106:22.75]We did it!
[106:23.17]Yeah, we did it, man!
[106:25.71]Give me 20!
[106:32.01]I was stuck in the foot of my robot when I got out of it.
[106:35.24]That was, we were helping right there.
[106:37.40]Oh, we got armor too.
[106:40.14]Perfect.
[106:42.35]That thing is, dude, do you just like step on ants?
[106:51.25]I wonder, so wait, go look at your menu.
[106:53.81]Is there like more slots?
[106:55.25]Yeah.
[106:55.75]Holy shit.
[106:56.01]Wait, what do you mean more slots?
[106:57.09]Like is there like more, do you have all them or is there like two or three more slots underneath that one?
[107:01.30]Like is there more of those?
[107:03.02]Yeah.
[107:03.72]Oh my goodness.
[107:04.42]There's always more of them because weapons go up to like level 90.
[107:06.64]Yeah, but aren't they technically the same thing but just higher quality?
[107:13.16]I think, I haven't seen something yet that has been exactly the same thing at a higher level.
[107:18.37]I mean, I haven't played that much.
[107:20.88]I assume the later ones you get get the stomps and the special actions that there are buttons for.
[107:28.19]Armored Core.
[107:29.03]Gus, yeah, it is like... Do you think that the new project that FromSoftware is working on is going to be Armored Core?
[107:38.80]Possible.
[107:39.66]I kind of don't think so.
[107:40.50]They haven't been very successful games, but people would actually pay attention to it now.
[107:44.98]I think...
[107:46.62]Mr. Guy?
[107:48.54]The creative director and everything?
[107:51.66]Mr. Guy, yeah.
[107:52.72]Mr. Guy, yeah.
[107:53.56]I think he's too creative of a person to want to just go back and do Armored Core if he has all this clout within a company that he can do whatever the fuck he wanted.
[108:02.39]That's true.
[108:04.47]That would be like... Yeah, I don't think that's going to happen.
[108:08.99]Holy shit.
[108:11.85]New stuff?
[108:12.49]New things to destroy?
[108:14.84]Shield bearers?
[108:18.06]Yeah, you have to get inside the barrier and destroy it.
[108:20.42]Okay, let's get in there Hey, we can walk right through I wonder if my tank can get in because otherwise what am I doing?
[108:36.98]Cannon that would be weird.
[108:38.24]I mean this is this thing still protected Or can we hurt this thing in here now?
[108:45.45]Yeah
[108:53.21]Yep.
[108:53.51]Alright, tank that in.
[109:00.52]Boom!
[109:03.60]Make sure you pick up the stuff.
[109:04.78]He's kind of in the way here.
[109:09.05]Alright, I gotta blow this thing up.
[109:12.53]Maybe he despawned.
[109:33.68]Where's this thing going?
[109:34.88]He's running too fast, but we can't keep up with him
[109:39.29]I can't even drive fast enough.
[109:41.29]Oh, tank sucks.
[109:42.49]Bring back Pacific Rim.
[109:44.90]Yeah, we really showed the real cool part.
[109:46.80]Now we're just shooting bugs and monsters again.
[109:49.96]Oh my fuck.
[109:52.98]Well, did I shoot you or did I shoot a sign in front of me?
[109:55.76]I'm not sure.
[109:56.88]Okay.
[109:57.50]That wouldn't have happened in Pacific Rim.
[110:03.50]Yeah, that wouldn't have happened in Pacific Rim.
[110:08.34]These things are fucking annoying.
[110:10.06]Yeah, this is annoying.
[110:10.64]They don't do anything.
[110:11.80]They don't shoot back.
[110:12.84]It's just like, we could put a couple of... Oh my god, do you see me?
[110:16.32]No.
[110:19.38]I'm in the skybox.
[110:20.16]Look straight up.
[110:21.57]What?
[110:24.41]How did you get up there?
[110:25.67]I'm dead.
[110:26.15]Alright, I think here's the deal.
[110:34.97]We probably should play characters that can move real fast.
[110:38.44]Yeah, I'm gonna get my, uh, my sex girl.
[110:41.55]Yeah.
[110:48.41]Oh, what is this thing?
[110:52.81]I'm gonna just put on the dentist gun for fun.
[110:55.49]Alright, let's do it.
[111:05.27]This bucket head would step his game up.
[111:07.11]Yeah, here's the deal.
[111:14.47]I need another coffee.
[111:15.39]Should I drink another coffee or is that a very bad... No, it's like... What is it?
[111:19.51]It's like 1021.
[111:21.15]That's a bad idea to drink some coffee right now.
[111:22.91]What do you think?
[111:23.92]That's been a bad idea to drink some coffee.
[111:25.94]Why do I use the shittiest weapons?
[111:27.16]I don't know.
[111:30.26]Because it's fun to play with other things, I guess.
[111:35.82]Why are you so judgmental?
[111:42.41]Double dentist!
[111:46.80]That way you shoot these things You have to shoot the red thing, I don't know like I have no clue I've started shooting the red thing and it died.
[111:57.12]I don't know if it's a coincidence.
[111:58.64]I mean I was just holding the beam on it You're all come on even when we're fast people now I can follow it fine I
[112:15.17]These enemies suck.
[112:16.77]They really do.
[112:24.37]Yeah, we know we can pass through the shield screen.
[112:27.77]What is hurting me?
[112:29.55]Oh, there's like those big scary guys over there.
[112:32.77]Oh, now there's like, it has them inside of the shields.
[112:40.06]This guy just keeps moving away from us.
[112:43.10]It's like, okay, he's dead.
[112:46.23]Any items that guy dropped?
[112:48.21]Yeah, he did.
[112:49.09]Two items!
[112:52.48]Ooh, hello!
[112:53.90]Hello!
[112:55.20]Hello!
[112:55.72]Hello?
[113:01.34]Now we gotta stick together.
[113:02.06]What the fuck is shooting me?
[113:12.41]What the fuck?!
[113:14.71]Well, I'm dead.
[113:15.98]They have so much health.
[113:19.27]I think we split up for some reason.
[113:22.27]Like we were chasing the one that was running away and then you flew to another one.
[113:25.41]You went really far away.
[113:26.87]I wasn't going to follow you.
[113:28.75]Well, I thought we were trying to kill the same one.
[113:34.15]Did you just try to resume?
[113:35.39]It did not work.
[113:35.94]It just hurt you.
[113:38.36]No, I got shot.
[113:39.00]Alright, so just stay on the same one.
[113:41.02]You weren't going to follow the one that was running away?
[113:46.51]I don't know which one you went after I only saw the one running the second one that we attacked It was the one that was like sprinting away Resume act yep They come to this one over to our right, yeah, I Think this is the same one if I shoot him from the other side, he'll walk back to us.
[114:11.52]No, I
[114:16.54]Yeah, see how he, like, sprints away?
[114:22.34]No, I haven't noticed that.
[114:23.24]Fuck, man.
[114:25.68]Ugh.
[114:26.76]He, like, just barely fucking... He, like, walked forward a second, and I ended up hitting the fucking shield.
[114:35.28]Is it health down there?
[114:36.88]I hope so.
[114:37.08]Red alert.
[114:38.02]Inbound airstrikes.
[114:38.44]All ground units disengage from the enemy now.
[114:50.69]Airstrikes in 2017 That's why we Not good Yeah, these guys are okay, yeah, these guys are hard to kill when you have to stand next to them I
[115:23.91]What's the plan here?
[115:28.73]Airstrike, is that going to even hurt them?
[115:33.38]No.
[115:36.34]Kind of.
[115:41.08]No, they're like in the shield still.
[115:43.62]Fuck, yeah, we got to kill... It's hard to get in there.
[115:48.61]I know.
[115:50.79]Dead again.
[115:51.27]It shot through a building to kill me.
[115:54.72]I can't resurrect it, I don't think.
[115:58.12]This is one of the missions that's just not fun.
[116:00.78]And I would already say, like, let's just beat it on easy and keep having fun.
[116:05.70]Let's just keep having fun.
[116:07.69]Yeah, because I'm not having fun.
[116:10.15]Can I get you with this much health?
[116:11.57]No.
[116:17.05]I'm gonna die.
[116:17.77]You need Pacific Rim.
[116:19.47]Dude, that would actually work.
[116:20.88]That would work, but you need to kill things to get the credits, don't you?
[116:32.34]I want to I want to retreat and try that and then we'll have fun.
[116:35.68]Okay, if this doesn't work That's what you wanted to do it on easy or do pacific rim Pacific rim Wait, give me one also This seems like something you need like a a fencer for but neither of us can play that because we have like level four items Plus not a whole lot of armor either.
[116:50.89]Oh I'm gonna take this off Wing divers can equip two weapons
[116:57.13]I don't really have anything that great for the Wing Diver, unfortunately.
[117:02.95]Thunder Bow.
[117:03.37]I'll try the Thunder Bow here.
[117:04.33]And I'm going to take this off.
[117:09.63]Oh, and I have a... What's a Doodle?
[117:16.18]Just try to get right up on the thing.
[117:17.40]Just burn it.
[117:19.94]The What's a Doodle?
[117:22.50]Time to go back to Mission 2 and grind!
[117:30.95]Have, uh, a plantable bombs if I ever actually get close enough.
[117:35.10]Let's see how that works on this first one.
[117:36.78]What's the strategy you're going for here?
[117:39.56]Uh, try and earn enough credits to be able to get... Do you need to get, like, last hits, or does that matter at all?
[117:45.68]I don't think it does.
[117:46.74]Okay.
[117:50.62]Oh, sup, dudes?
[117:51.32]Hey, what's going on, Freed?
[117:55.98]I'm just gonna put on the rapier and just... just try to get wicked close and...
[118:06.52]Darth butt crust it's not just about the items because we can get weapons pretty easily but Then you have a fencer that has the default amount of man hard.
[118:14.46]Holy shit.
[118:15.00]Okay.
[118:15.30]Yeah this thing What did you just do?
[118:21.97]I didn't see that you were that far ahead of me sorry I was reading your chat like bad streamer makes his friends do it I just I just read the chat what are you talking about well I can kill these things very fast don't do anything here wait let me hit it because I want to get my thing alright well I didn't know do you need I don't know if I need last hits well get it
[118:40.65]My god, can you not I wasn't standing next to it.
[118:45.05]It's a very big explosion.
[118:46.41]Well, you didn't Okay, next time tell me huge explosion.
[118:52.09]I thought you had like I'm going in there I'm going like I can't go from here Alright, go ahead go have fun And you blew the bridge underneath me
[119:14.41]Somebody said you don't need last hits.
[119:16.35]People in chat saying you don't need last hits.
[119:18.27]I just wanted to try my bomb.
[119:19.51]Okay, that's what I really wanted.
[119:20.69]Your bombs work perfectly fine, honey.
[119:23.89]I tried to hold him down to throw it.
[119:25.37]It doesn't work.
[119:26.13]Pick up those ITAMs.
[119:26.90]Why should I pick them up when you already are?
[119:30.98]Alright, we got the ITAMs.
[119:34.78]Okay, that's like... I think I can just burn this thing immediately before it starts to leave.
[119:47.90]Oh yeah, that's good.
[119:49.42]This is good.
[119:50.22]This is perfect.
[119:51.55]We're going to be fine now.
[119:52.75]I can just fly around and burn the fuck out of these things and kill them in one clip.
[119:57.01]And then I can summon a Pacific Rim.
[119:59.57]Yes.
[120:00.41]Alright.
[120:02.15]I'm going to go over here now.
[120:03.58]To the one that's further away.
[120:04.60]Because I don't want to... Jesus, man.
[120:07.10]No, I can't.
[120:07.72]Look at the... This sucks.
[120:11.04]They both have two giant mech guys inside of both bubbles.
[120:15.04]If you can fly around and fast enough, I mean I'm gonna go for I'm gonna try but holy fuck man This is gonna be difficult No boy, no I'm dead They just turn and just fire and kill you Oh and we're about to get air striked Well, hold on
[120:43.16]This thing's still alive?
[120:44.76]If you can... I got airstriked.
[120:49.46]Having those two huge guys in the shield is like, oh my god.
[120:53.08]That's what I'm saying.
[120:53.93]You need a fencer to be really fast and get in there.
[120:56.57]But our fencer is shit.
[121:02.43]Oh, you know what?
[121:03.25]Okay.
[121:05.01]If we can get those guys to get out of the bubble... I don't think they were walking, really.
[121:09.98]I mean, they looked like they were moving.
[121:11.74]They kind of just stand in there.
[121:17.50]I can get something that I can call him from the beginning, maybe.
[121:20.70]You only activate when you pierce the bubble.
[121:22.42]Aren't those the only guys that we could attack?
[121:24.16]Were those two on either side?
[121:27.85]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[121:30.57]Here's the plan.
[121:32.73]I'm going to come in from the front.
[121:33.89]No, I'm going to come in from the back as you come in the front.
[121:36.85]They can't kill us both, and I'm going to burn it.
[121:40.96]Put... No, no, no, no, no.
[121:42.88]Here's what we're doing.
[121:43.76]Do you have an M3 rapier?
[121:47.73]We need to just fly together and just short-range dentist.
[121:53.12]That's what I'm saying, except we come from different sides so that they don't shoot us both.
[121:58.42]I know, but I don't see you with an M3 rapier on you right now.
[122:03.82]Okay, now you do.
[122:04.26]Alright, stay together.
[122:07.48]Just eee.
[122:09.46]That's the description I'm going to use here is eee.
[122:14.70]Eee.
[122:15.62]Both at the same time.
[122:16.32]We just do eee at the same time.
[122:21.55]short-range dental gun I don't have any ability you will trust me and we both have to calibrate it at the same time yeah chat what do I have to do e completion rate one percent alright let's see how quick it is when we both do this the same time
[122:51.59]Okay, yeah.
[122:52.29]Let's go to the next one.
[123:07.68]Good E's.
[123:08.16]Nice E. Nice E. Now which one are we going to next?
[123:13.94]I want to get behind that one.
[123:16.04]and coming from the other side so that they don't instantly shoot me.
[123:18.27]Because they're going to have to turn and you're going to come in the front.
[123:20.55]Let me get some boost here.
[123:22.35]So I'm going to go right in the front door?
[123:23.75]An E?
[123:24.81]Just wait.
[123:25.29]Be patient.
[123:26.03]Okay.
[123:26.25]Because they're also about to summon the airstrikes.
[123:29.09]Right.
[123:30.49]Let me know when you want me to go in an E. Red alert.
[123:32.29]Inbound airstrikes.
[123:37.76]All ground units disengage from the enemy now.
[123:39.48]Okay.
[123:43.04]Airstrikes in 2017?
[123:43.58]There you go.
[123:47.74]Where's the airstrike?
[123:49.91]Wait.
[123:51.25]Hello?
[123:53.99]Hello?
[123:54.59]I think we killed those things too fast.
[124:03.37]Ow!
[124:08.70]This is another reason why this mission sucks.
[124:29.39]Alright, we ready?
[124:31.55]We going in?
[124:32.11]Are we E'ing?
[124:34.67]Are we going in?
[124:36.27]Yeah.
[124:36.91]Alright, go right to the middle.
[124:39.13]And E!
[124:40.97]E!
[124:44.72]If you get under it, they can't shoot it.
[124:46.88]Got it, got it, got it, got it.
[124:48.28]Oh!
[124:53.24]Okay, so this mission sucks.
[125:08.21]I was trying to be above while you were below.
[125:09.91]No, it didn't matter.
[125:10.75]They just shoot and explode everything.
[125:12.59]So what you're saying is you can put this on easy and we're just going to fucking beat it.
[125:17.82]Yeah.
[125:20.56]Okay, let's go.
[125:24.18]Still on hard.
[125:28.21]Alright.
[125:28.77]I need to put on some new stuff.
[125:29.81]We're putting on easy.
[125:33.15]It's on easy.
[125:35.44]We're still going with the same strategy.
[125:36.98]Yeah, same strategy.
[125:37.98]I'm just two level zero rapiers.
[125:40.70]Oh, no.
[125:41.12]Whatever this thing is.
[125:41.76]Who cares?
[125:53.38]I love how quick you guys are with that shit.
[125:55.74]It's fucking hilarious.
[125:57.18]That wasn't my joke.
[125:58.67]No, that was their joke.
[125:59.63]I saw it before you said it.
[126:01.23]Really?
[126:01.67]Oh.
[126:02.77]Then I'm as clever as them.
[126:05.29]I should get commended.
[126:11.17]Let's see how easy this is.
[126:12.49]Same deal.
[126:14.01]Ready?
[126:24.42]Very large object, even at the minus sign.
[126:27.46]In 1927, you understand... Guys, don't pick up weapon crates.
[126:38.67]Oh, okay.
[126:41.27]You're really just cluttering your weapon management with level 1 weapons you'll never use.
[126:45.41]Are we just fucking the airstrike?
[126:46.47]Who cares?
[126:46.83]It's going.
[126:49.25]Yeah.
[126:50.21]Alright.
[126:50.97]We're gonna destroy this before the airstrike and we'll kill him.
[127:06.04]Easy.
[127:08.10]Easy.
[127:10.95]Easy.
[127:11.71]I got comboed in the air too and I'm fine.
[127:14.71]Yeah.
[127:16.05]Wow.
[127:16.77]Easy is fucking easy, huh?
[127:19.01]I would have laughed my ass off if we died there.
[127:27.03]We need, okay, we might actually die.
[127:28.38]See, he even just said it on the thing.
[127:29.86]That's why we now have the fencer's equipment.
[127:32.08]Yeah.
[127:36.92]This gun's actually kind of cool.
[127:42.13]You stay there.
[127:43.15]You stay here.
[127:43.69]Because if I die, then it's over.
[127:45.75]Oh, I can't stay here!
[127:48.53]You're going right into it.
[127:49.93]You're right in the eye of the storm.
[127:51.59]You're in the eye of the storm.
[127:53.16]Well, it can't hurt me.
[127:57.40]Why did I get hit by that?
[127:59.79]Why did I get hit by that?
[128:03.25]That doesn't make any sense.
[128:18.34]Stop it, stop it.
[128:22.76]Quick, get the crates.
[128:24.16]Come on, the care packages.
[128:27.21]Don't get the weapon crates.
[128:28.34]I already got them.
[128:29.06]You'll regret it.
[128:29.84]Who cares?
[128:30.32]It's not like we're gonna regret it.
[128:34.28]Why would I regret it?
[128:34.96]It's for one mission.
[128:35.87]Because you're gonna have a whole bunch of level one weapons.
[128:38.37]And you're gonna have to scroll through them to find the weapons you actually want.
[128:41.81]You know what I'm talking about?
[128:42.55]Are you serious?
[128:43.92]Yes.
[128:46.60]red alert airstrikes imminent move away from the shield bearers on the double there's no that we did it's over pvp aiming on this thing is awful whoa the hectors can shoot through shield screens
[129:13.10]Oh my god, they're still doing the dialog.
[129:15.14]Where's this gun shooting?
[129:16.24]Does anybody know where this gun is shooting right now?
[129:18.34]If you're flying, it fucks it up.
[129:19.60]Oh.
[129:22.56]This game sucks!
[129:26.29]They can hit us?
[129:27.45]Oh, they can hit us?
[129:28.05]This game sucks!
[129:38.07]Are you okay, sir?
[129:45.52]Well, this is... Thank God we're doing this on easy.
[129:50.21]Just because this mission sucks.
[129:53.97]We just, like, sit around and kill three enemies, and then... Oh, no, there's another one.
[129:57.07]You know what to do.
[130:01.09]Okay.
[130:08.86]So many code names.
[130:09.98]Quit defending.
[130:10.40]My FPS dropped.
[130:10.78]Yeah, what happened to the bugs?
[130:11.76]The bugs were fun.
[130:14.20]I don't like the robots.
[130:48.16]They're not a threat in and of themselves, but their defenses can turn a battle against us.
[130:53.25]I love this being like an annoying bee.
[130:55.73]Yeah, we already killed it.
[130:57.25]Yeah, it's dead.
[131:04.10]Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang.
[131:04.98]Wee wee wee wee wee wee wee.
[131:10.58]Cool.
[131:11.10]Wow, we're great at this game.
[131:12.38]We're really good at this game.
[131:16.02]Give me the armor.
[131:16.72]That's all I care about in these missions because this guy doesn't have very much.
[131:19.86]This girl.
[131:20.32]Any more shield stuff over there?
[131:24.46]Yep.
[131:33.49]There's more?
[131:34.49]Okay, no.
[131:35.21]Alright, thank god.
[131:36.97]Now, can you select the next mission on hard if you beat one on easy?
[131:39.85]Yeah.
[131:40.67]Why the hell didn't we do that last night?
[131:43.02]Because we wanted to beat it.
[131:44.54]The fuck were we thinking?
[131:46.00]Oh, cool.
[131:46.42]Two new level zero items.
[131:48.24]I have to fucking have in my thing.
[131:50.82]God damn it, Jeremy.
[131:52.63]Hold on, I got it.
[131:54.05]This is another mission with those stupid shield things again.
[131:58.33]Are you scared to do this on normal or hard?
[132:03.38]Oh...
[132:06.51]We'll try it.
[132:07.33]I think we're assholes if we don't at least try.
[132:09.59]Yeah, we are.
[132:10.25]Let me take a piss.
[132:10.83]I'll be right back.
[132:11.67]You're not muted, so... No, in second thought, yes, you are.
[132:15.12]I ain't gonna give him the opportunity to fucking be a dickburger.
[132:18.96]I'll be right back.
[134:12.99]A dog.
[134:13.93]Hello, good dog.
[134:15.01]Alright.
[134:16.13]I am back.
[134:16.53]So what you're saying is you want to do the... Hold on, shit.
[134:24.99]One second.
[134:27.65]Can you hear me?
[134:28.13]Am I muted?
[134:28.59]Hi.
[134:30.04]Hi.
[134:30.72]Hold on.
[134:31.94]Supersonic201, thanks for the sub.
[134:33.48]Proximity, thanks for the sub as well.
[134:37.82]Blurgly for two months.
[134:39.90]I'll drink another coffee if you do.
[134:41.22]Well, I have a Coke now.
[134:43.86]So, I'm not drinking coffee anymore.
[134:45.64]It's a little too late for that.
[134:47.94]Snowded Kibbles, thanks for the sub.
[134:51.04]Welcome back, guys.
[134:53.78]Thanks for the bits as well.
[134:54.88]You guys dropping these bits.
[134:58.72]Thanks.
[135:01.56]I love you.
[135:03.14]Okay.
[135:04.76]I am ready to go.
[135:06.48]You multiply my armor by 10?
[135:08.06]Yeah.
[135:09.79]That's the limit that we can have for this.
[135:12.73]Well, I know.
[135:13.07]That's what we were saying last night.
[135:15.55]We kind of needed to play the game for a while.
[135:18.65]I'm playing Fencer and I have plus 7 armor off of the default.
[135:22.97]Oh, you're actually playing Fencer.
[135:24.59]Yeah, we're doing hard, so change your weapons from level 0.
[135:27.13]Yep, yep, yep.
[135:29.15]Rapier Thrust.
[135:31.50]And... I'm going to stay with the Rapier.
[135:39.32]Okay, let's open it.
[135:40.18]Let's see how good this Coca-Cola Classic is.
[135:43.29]Yeah, my... Okay, these are just by themselves.
[135:52.49]Oh, God.
[135:53.06]And there's hives in here.
[135:58.28]I wonder if I'm going to be able to do this by myself in here.
[136:00.04]I might be able to get this off and kill one of them.
[136:08.68]Okay, I got one.
[136:10.00]I'm getting out.
[136:12.76]That's actually not terrible considering that they're... I died in one hit.
[136:21.97]Why don't you play Fencer?
[136:23.43]I have no idea what's going on.
[136:27.95]Now you know.
[136:28.83]Okay.
[136:29.19]Now it's all confirmed.
[136:35.73]I'm gonna try... Oh man, I could actually get the Walking Fortress on this one.
[136:40.79]Because there'll be enough bugs for you to kill.
[136:42.99]You want to go for it, or I can try and dent this with you?
[136:45.49]My strategy was, because the bugs are on the ground, I can just fly in and get rid of the shields, and then just fly from shield to shield while you do something else and kill the bugs.
[136:55.46]Okay.
[136:55.86]Is that coherent for you?
[136:56.92]Does it make any sense?
[136:57.76]Yeah, yeah.
[136:59.32]Okay.
[137:01.49]If you want to be Air Raider guy, I mean, go for it, get the Walking Fortress.
[137:06.78]And, uh, you know.
[137:09.84]If you destroy those things, I can call bombing runs in.
[137:13.20]Okay.
[137:13.54]Someone said, I saw somebody beat this mission by loading a tank with C4 and then just throwing it in.
[137:21.77]Yeah, but giant robots, though.
[137:22.91]That is a good point.
[137:29.36]Going in.
[137:35.01]Come on, give me some good bug RNG.
[137:37.43]Give me good bug RNG.
[137:44.68]Good bug RNG.
[137:49.82]Got some pretty good bug RNG there, guys.
[137:54.18]Okay, this might be a little bit more difficult too.
[137:57.19]If you can destroy that one.
[138:05.18]Got it.
[138:05.60]Ooh, see ya.
[138:06.70]I'm out of boost.
[138:08.80]That good?
[138:12.55]Oh, boy.
[138:13.71]Holy shit.
[138:15.41]Holy hell.
[138:16.37]Bye.
[138:17.43]I ran out of boost right when I got the second one.
[138:25.99]Oh.
[138:27.41]Okay.
[138:28.33]They're all coming at you, but you just killed like a hundred of them.
[138:33.61]I'm halfway to the walking fortress.
[138:35.23]There's, like, at least 30 other coming to get you.
[138:39.73]But if you res me, then we got it sold.
[138:41.75]Oh, you're dead instantly.
[138:42.93]One shot.
[138:46.32]I can do that.
[138:46.88]I just get to conserve a little bit better.
[138:49.74]Mm-hmm.
[138:56.91]I'm going to not go to the second one right off the bat.
[138:58.95]I don't know why, for some reason I wanted to go faster.
[139:00.93]I guess I was scared that they were going to spawn more of that shit.
[139:04.56]It takes me a long time to get there anyway.
[139:06.32]Yeah, so I'll get the first one and then get out and recharge.
[139:18.83]I'm just going to come back to where you are.
[139:20.27]Let me recharge.
[139:27.69]I'm not calling in the bomb until you get the second one watch out to the left there's like at least a dozen coming up here right now can you handle these by yourself yeah you sure yeah okay well I'm going in in like five seconds there we go in the tower area there was an underground tunnel exit made by the giant insects
[140:00.66]It's dead.
[140:02.40]Floating back over to you.
[140:04.26]That's health.
[140:20.53]Holy fuck.
[140:28.98]Once I get this frickin' titan.
[140:30.94]Just get the titan!
[140:33.99]Oh, I'm trying to follow them around.
[140:40.87]75% of the way there.
[140:41.71]Stay with the troops.
[140:42.49]Stay with the troops here.
[140:46.63]That's how long it took them to walk down the hill, by the way.
[140:49.86]Seriously, holy shit dude.
[140:54.88]Help.
[140:55.52]How you doing on help?
[140:57.76]You can look at me.
[140:59.44]My health bar is on your screen at all times.
[141:02.80]Too much time.
[141:03.98]Get that health back.
[141:09.17]Pick up the health over here.
[141:11.89]You need to stay alive.
[141:12.81]You can fly over to that hole.
[141:17.25]My weapons aren't really designed to take that out.
[141:21.42]Uh, yeah, they are.
[141:22.02]No, they aren't.
[141:22.92]No, they aren't.
[141:23.50]That's why you can destroy the shields so fast, because they just do a shit ton of damage.
[141:26.32]Quiet, quiet.
[141:27.20]You're getting into my gamer sense right now.
[141:28.67]I wonder what that means.
[141:34.55]You're in my gamer sense.
[141:45.42]It's gone.
[141:46.96]Calling it in.
[141:49.14]On me?
[141:51.80]Oh boy.
[141:53.08]Look at how many helicopters it takes to carry this fucking thing.
[141:57.27]That's amazing.
[142:00.03]Alright, here we go guys.
[142:02.35]Drop it!
[142:13.98]Here we go!
[142:14.80]Now the regular sized ants once again.
[142:20.84]I'm gonna go get the other thing.
[142:23.70]You know what I mean, the other dung pile.
[142:27.24]I don't think I can hit the ants on the ground.
[142:29.45]I'm stuck in your body.
[142:30.43]Dude, you are so big.
[142:33.11]You're like too big.
[142:40.88]Dude, they're actually destroying this because I can't really hit them.
[142:43.24]And all of their projectiles are hitting me.
[142:45.90]Well, this is dead.
[142:47.24]Oh, red ants are coming out of this one.
[142:49.22]Red ants?
[142:50.52]Yeah, they're fucking tough.
[142:55.86]Oh, man, there really are red ants.
[142:57.29]I'm scared now.
[142:58.39]They're climbing on me.
[143:03.19]Oh, fuck.
[143:05.15]Too many ants.
[143:08.97]I'm going to be in deep shit right now.
[143:16.31]This red ant.
[143:17.09]The big red ants.
[143:18.17]I got the red ant hole.
[143:19.67]Oh, thank god.
[143:22.21]I'm about to run out of juice.
[143:24.15]Where's the other holes?
[143:25.50]I don't know.
[143:26.30]There's not many, I don't think.
[143:32.38]I actually like this kind of laser bolt thing.
[143:34.60]It's pretty useful.
[143:37.02]I can hear you moving your mouse around like wildly.
[143:39.58]You are so ready to go.
[143:41.26]Because you have to swing it so far.
[143:44.04]I'm going to take this opportunity.
[143:47.19]We need to get items.
[143:47.93]I'm going to go fly around and grab them.
[143:50.97]I just have a bug climbing on me.
[143:53.39]Help.
[143:54.69]Where is he?
[143:55.63]Oh, he's on your arm.
[143:57.14]Get him.
[143:58.26]Swing at him.
[144:00.98]You can't kill like one little bug.
[144:02.72]That's funny.
[144:09.59]That's so funny.
[144:11.51]Don't watch this fight!
[144:12.67]You can't get the one... There's so many items, dude.
[144:15.68]You're on your own for now.
[144:16.82]We can't miss these all.
[144:18.98]Ooh, I got one!
[144:25.01]Those might be the only two left.
[144:29.73]Only one left, I got it.
[144:33.65]Wow, that thing really is massive.
[144:36.59]Do Mission 2 on the hardest difficulty?
[144:38.03]Well, here's the reason why we don't want to do that.
[144:40.69]If we do Mission 2 on the hardest difficulty and we get, like, level 40, 50 weapons or whatever, we can't use those on hard and our characters don't have enough armor to do it on hard.
[144:48.92]I think for the level of difficulty of how high we've gotten, we can use, like, level 30 items now and we'll get level 30 items from Mission 2 on hardest.
[144:57.30]Will we?
[144:58.38]Yeah.
[145:00.59]I think that's, I think, yeah, kill it.
[145:02.35]It's possible.
[145:03.93]We could try.
[145:04.39]I have level 42 items from doing some hardest stuff.
[145:07.47]I thought we could only have up to level 28 stuff on hard.
[145:11.45]No, because our missions are higher now.
[145:13.89]So I feel like this mission was a max of 30.
[145:18.47]Well, I got a level 25 laser lance.
[145:19.81]I got 25 and a 26 actually.
[145:21.11]But they're kind of shitty things.
[145:26.21]Let's see.
[145:26.83]Weapon, uh, where is it?
[145:27.91]Oh, up to level 30.
[145:28.75]Okay.
[145:29.75]Do you want to just go back and do... Yeah, let's do it.
[145:32.36]Let's do it.
[145:32.88]Alright, you guys ready for Mission 2?
[145:35.18]Do what we get.
[145:35.66]Get hyped for Mission 2?
[145:36.38]Let me see what that thing is.
[145:41.22]What is that noise?
[145:47.88]This thing.
[145:48.29]Oh, dude, look at this thing.
[145:50.09]Alright.
[145:51.15]I'm into that.
[145:52.79]Hold on.
[145:53.81]What's wrong?
[145:54.09]Hold on.
[145:56.91]Hey, coffee, cheetos, chicken, thanks for three months.
[146:00.56]Welcome back, much appreciated.
[146:03.78]Nduri, thanks for two months, spending my lunch money wisely.
[146:07.22]Well, I'm glad to take your lunch money.
[146:09.34]No, that's horrible to say.
[146:10.26]I sound like a bully.
[146:11.56]I'm glad to take your lunch money.
[146:14.78]No, I'm not glad to take your lunch money.
[146:16.52]Did he just like fall through his wall?
[146:20.46]Me?
[146:21.80]You made like a crash through a wall noise.
[146:23.60]I don't know what that would have been.
[146:27.12]Oh, opening my door, the lock popping sounds really loud in my mic for some reason, because of how much it echoes out there.
[146:33.40]Who gave these 500... Oh, I can hear that.
[146:38.89]What the fuck is that?
[146:39.97]Somebody, like, knocking on your ceiling?
[146:44.03]Possibly.
[146:44.53]Somebody hammering a nail in downstairs?
[146:48.61]Somebody gave 500 bits while he figures out who's trying to, like, break into his apartment.
[146:53.62]Somebody gave 500, but it's not showing up in Twitch alerts.
[146:56.04]So, but thanks for the five bucks, dude.
[146:57.80]It says four Jerma days in a row, including bonus Ster.
[147:00.60]Holy jeez.
[147:02.24]Well, I don't know why it's not showing your name.
[147:04.89]But thanks.
[147:05.69]I think someone's hammering.
[147:07.41]Also, never trust a purple with a thousand.
[147:08.97]Thanks, purple.
[147:10.97]purple just adding to his like 500,000 bits that he's given to this channel so far thanks a lot man they say for star besides the fortress's normal punching it can do a downward punch in a haymaker apparently it's I was doing some different stuff earlier but it was annoying to do and
[147:31.43]R1, R1, L1, R1, L1, L1, R1, L1.
[147:34.69]Left, down, up, right.
[147:37.47]Wait, is that like right mouse button, left mouse button?
[147:40.73]It's like a combo I guess you can do.
[147:47.95]And play the class you want to play to level up.
[147:50.68]Okay.
[148:00.69]It's Ranger and you know it.
[148:01.97]No, it's not, though.
[148:03.35]Ranger's fun, I like playing it, but playing Wing Lady for the last, like, two missions is like, wow, this is fun, flying around and killing things.
[148:10.02]What do you guys think?
[148:13.50]Alright, the first person that says the class is the thing I'm gonna play.
[148:17.42]First, I don't care, the first fucking person in chat that says it.
[148:20.36]First one was Ranger, boy.
[148:21.59]Nope, that stream delay.
[148:23.57]It's gonna be like, whatever it is.
[148:25.61]You're going to guess when stream delay is, then pick whichever one you want it.
[148:28.63]Shh.
[148:34.01]Ranger.
[148:35.61]Ranger.
[148:35.88]I saw Fencer first.
[148:37.84]I saw two Fencers first.
[148:38.80]It was not between Fencer.
[148:40.06]It was between Ranger and... Dancer.
[148:43.28]Was it?
[148:44.08]What the fuck is the name of this character?
[148:46.14]Dancer.
[148:47.09]Okay, play Dancer.
[148:50.43]The Ameriman gave the 500.
[148:51.81]I gave the last 500.
[148:53.01]Say the name right or I'm taking it back.
[148:55.49]Ameriman.
[148:57.89]Why is it not showing up?
[148:59.78]Is your name like a swear word?
[149:00.94]It's not.
[149:02.64]Do a poll.
[149:03.46]Straw poll.
[149:04.02]I could do that.
[149:05.22]Let's do it actually democratically.
[149:07.00]Sorry, Star, you have to wait.
[149:08.88]Okay.
[149:09.72]I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
[149:12.50]Because this is a democracy in this chat.
[149:14.82]Let's treat it as one.
[149:20.26]Ranger... or... Wind... What the fuck is her name?
[149:27.39]I never remember.
[149:28.17]Windrider?
[149:32.13]Alright, Ranger or Wind Rider?
[149:35.37]Here you go.
[149:36.87]It's a democracy.
[149:38.69]See what you guys want me to do.
[149:50.38]Gobo.
[149:53.98]Wind Rider.
[149:55.38]You said it right.
[149:56.92]Well, thank you, Ameriman.
[149:59.14]Thank you for the $1,500.
[150:01.46]That's 15 bucks.
[150:04.06]Appreciate it, man.
[150:08.67]Purple, I will give money to this channel every day until I die.
[150:14.35]Well, you don't have to do that, but I appreciate it nonetheless, dude.
[150:20.25]If you want to give me money, I'm not going to say no, but I'm not going to encourage it.
[150:27.47]Thank you.
[150:29.97]Looks like Windrider's winning with 57%.
[150:33.15]We can close this poll in 10 seconds.
[150:40.01]Why didn't you get to vote?
[150:41.11]Vote.
[150:43.00]What about all the other people that were in the bathroom?
[150:44.36]I want to see the poll.
[150:45.22]People are saying Mission 12 is the best to farm.
[150:47.10]Apparently it plays itself and gives better weapons.
[150:50.26]That was the one where all the ants just come down.
[150:52.18]It was fun.
[150:52.96]Yeah.
[150:54.38]Yeah.
[150:55.85]Thanks, LPG Games.
[150:56.89]Welcome.
[150:57.27]Thanks a lot, dude.
[150:58.23]Thanks for the subscription.
[151:00.97]No, no Fencer.
[151:02.81]There's no option for Fencer because it's a class that I don't want to play.
[151:07.84]I want to play Wind Rider or Ranger.
[151:10.50]One of those two.
[151:11.56]I don't want to play Fencer because I don't have any shit for Fencer and I don't have any armor for Fencer.
[151:17.16]I don't want to play Fencer.
[151:19.15]He's too slow.
[151:20.39]He's dumb looking.
[151:21.61]He reminds me of Fallout 4.
[151:23.83]And you know how I feel about that game in a power suit because it gets me going.
[151:31.01]Alright, looks like we're doing Wind Rider.
[151:33.45]Which... That's fine with me.
[151:37.55]I like Wind Rider.
[151:38.55]It's good.
[151:40.65]Goliath, Goliath, coward, coward, coward, coward, coward, coward.
[151:45.51]You think we would enjoy playing Killing Floor 2?
[151:48.70]We probably would.
[151:50.28]But as of right now, it's EDF, man.
[151:55.17]But thanks a lot, dude.
[151:56.27]Dragon Breath.
[151:57.79]Junkhead227, thanks for the sub.
[151:59.43]And Blue Milk Dealer, thanks for two months in a row.
[152:04.32]Alright.
[152:05.16]We're ready.
[152:05.90]Poll is closed.
[152:06.48]Thank you for watching.
[152:08.92]The poll is closed.
[152:09.44]Thank you for voting.
[152:10.61]Poll is closed.
[152:11.27]I'm turning the stream off.
[152:15.23]You can vote at Ranger?
[152:16.37]No.
[152:17.35]Wind Dancer.
[152:18.05]See, like, for example, you have 350 armor on Ranger.
[152:20.92]Okay, Wing Diver, not Wind Raider.
[152:23.56]You have 350 armor on Ranger.
[152:25.44]Yeah.
[152:26.04]You're, like, twice as survivable on Ranger as you would be on Fenrir.
[152:29.50]I know, but... No matter how good of a weapon he gets, he's still gonna go, oh, I'm gonna dash in with my sword and die in one hit to any ant.
[152:36.59]Mm-hmm.
[152:40.22]You know, on an ice hot day, I like to relax back and do a little bit of a sip with a Coca-Cola Classic.
[152:47.30]Not too stingy on the throat.
[152:49.38]Not too particular on the nasal passage.
[152:51.85]Coca-Cola Classic.
[152:53.91]It's only $1.49.
[152:56.19]Get it at Cumberland Farms.
[152:58.27]Get it at Walgreens.
[153:00.01]Check your local Walmart.
[153:02.19]Let's go.
[153:05.75]So this thing is just like a short-range super power move?
[153:10.77]Okay.
[153:11.91]Well, that takes a long time to reload.
[153:13.17]Holy shit.
[153:18.41]Wow.
[153:19.45]Wow.
[153:20.33]Okay.
[153:21.93]Very long reload.
[153:24.65]I'm killing you.
[153:25.25]See?
[153:28.23]I'm fine.
[153:34.90]This is the end.
[153:35.98]For you!
[153:38.06]Why did you just sound like Naruto?
[153:41.99]This is the end for you!
[153:50.88]Wait, was this on hard or hardest?
[153:52.94]I don't know.
[153:53.54]I'm not the one in control.
[153:55.46]This would have had to have been hard.
[153:57.98]You're the one that's in control.
[153:59.55]Can we check anyway?
[154:00.29]I don't think so.
[154:06.21]I'm pretty sure it's hard.
[154:07.63]What the hell, dude?
[154:10.49]Ugh.
[154:15.03]Can you believe this guy?
[154:16.03]He just sits around and does a straw fall and doesn't even, like, set the difficulty right.
[154:19.45]Don't blame that on me.
[154:25.55]Wait, what's the highest level?
[154:26.41]Up to level 52?
[154:28.25]Yes.
[154:29.31]So we're looking for weapons that are, like, 30, is what you're saying.
[154:36.29]I guess.
[154:37.87]Yeah.
[154:38.93]Re-vote?
[154:39.47]No, we're gonna do a vote after every mission?
[154:42.91]Oh, yeah, re-vote!
[154:45.12]No, the people have spoken.
[154:47.76]Thanks, NotBird, for two months.
[154:49.54]What is this game?
[154:50.18]A game for ants?
[154:52.40]It is a game for ants.
[154:54.35]Well, it's a game for humans to kill ants, you know what I'm saying?
[154:57.93]By the way.
[154:58.27]There's more ants in it than humans.
[154:59.61]And by the way, when you want to relax and the world's running you by too fast, get in your chair that lounges back, your favorite chair.
[155:12.57]The one that kind of smells like a dog because your dog sleeps in that chair.
[155:16.91]Get in that chair and relax.
[155:19.57]And tip back a satisfying Coca-Cola.
[155:23.72]Yeah.
[155:26.86]And then clean that fucking chair.
[155:28.34]Because it stinks.
[155:39.36]My frame rate is dying right now.
[155:43.90]Is there like too many tings going on?
[155:45.56]There's like too much.
[155:46.47]I'm down to like 30 FPS right there.
[155:50.17]What's the ting rate?
[155:50.91]I don't know.
[155:57.49]I don't want to kill you.
[156:04.21]How the fuck did you even get up here, buddy?
[156:13.01]Lots of stuff on the ground, too.
[156:14.75]That's your job.
[156:17.01]I know.
[156:17.29]I'm just waiting until it's safe.
[156:18.58]This is on hard difficulty.
[156:20.98]Very hard.
[156:21.72]Hardest.
[156:22.48]Oh my god.
[156:25.46]You alright?
[156:26.86]Yeah.
[156:27.38]I just hate how the helicopters fly.
[156:28.92]I'm disappointed.
[156:31.08]EDF.
[156:33.00]EDF.
[156:45.19]Anything I missed over there Well, that could have been bad it almost well you think you still hurt me There's only a couple tings going on attack the giant insects and save the citizens I
[157:16.69]Oh, hey, I'm the researcher.
[157:19.15]Am I incorrect to say, you know, actually, Epiphany, you could get high-level mech armor from just, like, someone letting you do Inferno with them, or letting you do Hardest with them, as this person, and the armor of the weapon, like, you calling it a mech, it's a level, like, it's a high-level mech.
[157:38.40]Your individual armor wouldn't even matter at that point.
[157:42.33]I guess.
[157:44.77]But you have to get it first.
[157:48.12]I'm trying to figure out the trajectory of this thing.
[157:50.00]I haven't really figured that out correctly yet.
[158:01.00]The data is incorrect.
[158:01.94]I feel like there's not a whole lot of drop, except it will hit the ground.
[158:09.32]Get out of the way, guys.
[158:13.82]Yeah, somebody said, that is correct.
[158:16.91]I know, I'm smart.
[158:20.32]I mean, you're... You might be too smart for your own good.
[158:26.02]I agree.
[158:30.38]You know, you... You were good.
[158:32.92]You may have even been the best.
[158:35.00]Where's that from?
[158:38.07]You were good, Sean.
[158:38.79]You may have even been the best.
[158:40.89]But no, you're not the best to me.
[158:46.45]Come here, you little fuck.
[158:47.87]Whoa, something's blowing up over here.
[159:10.42]Start picking stuff up.
[159:23.70]Not a whole lot of green boxes.
[159:28.02]Lots of health packs.
[159:34.61]Anybody see any greens that I missed?
[159:36.83]Don't think so.
[159:38.85]Yep.
[159:39.49]I think we're good.
[159:45.70]That guy drop anything you dropped it.
[159:50.74]Yeah, there's a weapon box right there.
[159:52.68]Where is it?
[159:55.28]Right on the street corner Turn around turn around on the ground He's your fucking blind spell, where is it?
[160:05.21]I don't fucking see it Got it on the street.
[160:08.31]It was right You said oh, it's on the street corner
[160:12.83]Like this... The street cor... This... We're on like a hundred... There's like fifty street corners.
[160:18.67]You're gonna be a street corner in a second.
[160:22.45]Uh... I didn't... I got a bunch of level thirty shit.
[160:26.90]I got one twenty-six item.
[160:36.26]I'm seeing a lot of failfish.
[160:38.94]You know how I feel about that emote.
[160:40.70]I'm going to contact Twitch and see what they say.
[160:43.18]Wait, no.
[160:44.82]I'm going to contact Twitch tomorrow and be like, excuse me, can you shut that emote off on my channel?
[160:49.88]I think I can.
[160:51.06]You can do that yourself.
[160:52.16]You don't have to contact Twitch.
[160:54.10]I'd like to get Twitch's response on it.
[160:56.62]Can you equip your high-level weapon?
[160:58.80]No.
[160:59.30]I don't.
[161:00.12]I didn't even care.
[161:04.18]I know you don't care, and that's really your problem.
[161:06.26]Well, I don't care until I get something.
[161:08.60]We're just grinding this shit.
[161:09.86]Who cares?
[161:10.62]Well, I know.
[161:10.92]It'll make it easier to grind this shit with a weapon that's 20 levels higher.
[161:14.48]If we could just get that command to be permanently disabled in this stream.
[161:19.41]No.
[161:20.19]Do what I... Oh, my God.
[161:21.49]You're inefficient.
[161:22.39]You're lackluster.
[161:23.77]I'd like it if I could contact Twitch.
[161:26.04]If I could get Twitch to make it so Star couldn't talk in the team speak, maybe we'll see what they say.
[161:32.94]See if I can get figure out like how to stop him from talking in our teams big Twitch, but we can probably help there How'd I get under here Watch out it's on the corner.
[161:49.64]I got it Fucking 20 ting rate
[162:14.58]Hey stop with that fire Burning me Is this a dream?
[162:50.54]I got hit once in that How could you because I have 170 on how could you I
[163:03.93]Why don't you just play this game for like a month straight?
[163:06.99]Not leave your house.
[163:08.42]And get to the point where we can do the hardest?
[163:14.80]Defensor gets a missile that takes 25 seconds to lock on.
[163:18.16]Requires an air raider to guide it.
[163:21.00]Holy shit.
[163:21.52]You know what Jerm's problem is?
[163:27.46]He doesn't even care.
[163:32.53]Land that ship.
[163:36.29]Get over here, Master Chief.
[163:44.20]Get over here, Master Chef.
[163:54.88]And I'm going to catch him right here.
[163:56.60]Oh, my.
[163:57.06]Okay.
[163:57.90]Okay.
[163:58.84]Okay.
[163:59.64]Come here.
[164:01.53]Coming over here.
[164:02.97]When you have some time.
[164:03.77]I'm on the way.
[164:06.02]What do you need?
[164:10.55]What is it?
[164:12.75]You got things you want to show me?
[164:14.95]Come to my helicopter.
[164:16.33]Yep.
[164:18.15]And jump into the blades.
[164:19.93]No.
[164:20.30]What?
[164:21.94]I didn't hurt me.
[164:23.68]I know.
[164:23.94]It's just fun.
[164:24.56]Why are you dead?
[164:24.94]It's fun for giggles.
[164:26.26]Because I was doing fun for giggles.
[164:27.82]What are you doing fun for giggles for?
[164:30.00]See, I'm doing you.
[164:30.84]I don't even care.
[164:33.00]Oh, he's got a nosedive!
[164:36.26]Get out!
[164:36.68]Get out!
[164:42.36]You're not supposed to be giggling.
[164:43.28]I was just doing fun for giggles.
[164:50.97]I'm gonna go pick up stuff.
[164:51.81]Save the citizens.
[164:54.45]Save the citizens.
[164:55.43]Save the citizens.
[164:57.55]Save the citizens.
[165:01.98]Save the citizens.
[165:06.48]Just do frog jump, and you'll land on everything you need.
[165:08.78]Just doing fun for giggles.
[165:12.54]Come on, guys.
[165:15.11]Yeah.
[165:16.29]Can we see?
[165:16.73]You guys are doing fail fishes to me.
[165:18.23]He was trying to do giggles when we need to collect these items?
[165:25.69]Can we unban the FailFish now, please? ...
[165:37.40]Good luck.
[165:42.35]How did that pass through that many ants?
[165:44.03]What the fuck?
[165:44.35]That is some next level bullshit.
[165:47.81]You're supposed to be trained in fighting giant insects.
[166:03.32]Anybody over there?
[166:06.57]What are you doing?
[166:07.61]Are you trying to shoot me?
[166:10.47]No, I'm laughing that I have eight turrets now.
[166:12.67]I have six.
[166:13.47]I thought you were trying to kill me or something.
[166:15.51]They're just so dumb.
[166:17.27]I don't know what they're shooting.
[166:18.27]I think I'm going to get hit by them.
[166:27.98]That's a lot of insects.
[166:34.45]Holy fuck.
[166:38.31]Well, I'm not going to get to use this helicopter.
[166:40.78]Looks like Jerm is just doing fun and giggles.
[166:45.98]Does anybody have any clue as to what the fuck just happened to me?
[166:55.03]Same thing.
[166:55.41]I got thrown into the sky.
[166:57.89]I'm assuming that's what happened to you.
[167:14.96]This is pretty much all on you.
[167:18.73]Someone had to fucking blow up my helicopter.
[167:21.39]Why did you just have to say that?
[167:30.98]Hardest difficulty.
[167:33.40]Super fucking hard.
[167:36.72]I don't even care.
[167:39.73]Hey, well, you're the one that was doing the giggle joke before, and now you're trying to yell at me for not caring?
[167:44.75]Okay, imagine if you didn't do the giggle joke.
[167:49.40]We would have had 100% HP.
[167:50.78]What's the giggle joke?
[167:54.74]Yeah.
[167:55.80]If you didn't do Mr. Giggles, we would have been fine.
[167:57.86]Imagine that world.
[168:19.20]Giggles streamer.
[168:28.91]Oh, there's that emote.
[168:30.35]Mr. Giggles.
[168:32.65]What are you doing?
[168:36.27]What do you mean, what am I doing?
[168:37.95]Putting a marker down?
[168:38.91]I was trying to use my ultimate.
[168:42.10]I pressed Q.
[168:50.75]Oh my fucking god.
[168:53.09]Hey, you remember why I got out of my helicopter in the first place?
[168:55.65]No, but let's be real.
[168:56.87]I'm gonna be fucking totally real.
[169:00.03]I think I hit the fucking body of like a dead ant that fell down.
[169:06.64]Like, I was trying to shoot it forward and there was like a fucking carcass.
[169:11.36]That just, it blew up in my fucking face.
[169:14.58]Like, give me a break.
[169:25.96]Should I just be using the acid blaster?
[169:28.26]I really probably should be.
[169:34.36]Hey, jump on my blade.
[169:35.30]I like the dumb random shit that you can just fucking fire in your own face.
[169:43.99]Good joke.
[169:44.47]I wasn't making a joke, I swear.
[169:48.01]I shot one of the random things that can be in- Like this guy.
[169:51.61]Like, look at this guy.
[169:53.17]What do you do- Like, get out of the fucking street.
[169:57.86]Get out of the way!
[169:59.37]I am, I just wanted to yell at the guy in the suit.
[170:01.05]Pick up items!
[170:01.77]I am!
[170:02.13]There's a green box over here.
[170:04.91]Stop yelling at me!
[170:07.13]Other side of the street, there's a green box.
[170:12.11]Hey, if someone doesn't tell you what to do, you just lose all direction.
[170:14.98]You want to fucking giggle-stream me?
[170:23.48]You're just trying to shoot me?
[170:26.26]No.
[170:28.02]I promise.
[170:28.72]I'm gonna get on a building.
[170:40.77]This one guy is gonna make my life a living hell right there.
[170:49.17]I see you.
[170:49.91]I can see you.
[170:50.69]You don't think I can see you?
[170:51.63]Get out of the way.
[170:56.49]I wish they would just be able to phase through them when they died.
[170:59.39]Oh, I'm out of the fire.
[171:24.73]I can't, like, stand still for more than a second right now.
[171:34.61]You're dead?
[171:35.90]Yeah.
[171:39.00]I overexerted myself.
[171:40.50]I mean, I might be able to swoop down and get you.
[171:42.10]You have to give me a second, though.
[171:47.51]Really not worth it, because then all I'm going to be able to do is run away and try and put another helicopter down.
[171:51.83]And it's going to take an hour to get here, and I'm going to die while it happens.
[171:54.56]Just, you know, play patient.
[171:55.92]You got this.
[173:26.87]Starve for power!
[173:29.57]Somebody, please!
[173:30.23]No shooting doesn't take power.
[173:31.94]I know, but I just don't want to fucking overexert.
[173:33.44]Alright, I'm coming to get you.
[173:38.86]No, I'm not.
[173:39.26]I'm dead.
[173:47.92]Hey, wanna equip those level 40 items you got?
[173:50.55]Yeah.
[173:55.00]What keeps killing you?
[173:56.78]Like halfway through?
[173:59.32]Being dumb.
[174:02.12]That's really about it.
[174:04.22]And I have no weapon.
[174:06.00]Why don't you have a weapon?
[174:07.06]Because I planned on being on my helicopter the whole time, but then I keep doing really dumb things with the helicopter.
[174:18.82]I know shooting doesn't use energy, but I need to focus on flying.
[174:25.54]Alright, I'm ready.
[174:30.02]What level is this?
[174:30.60]This is level 2 on hardest difficulty.
[174:39.52]Can't even beat... Yeah, we can't even beat mission 2.
[174:41.40]Holy shit.
[174:42.29]We suck.
[174:43.61]We beat it once.
[174:45.29]The first time.
[174:46.07]Not on hardest?
[174:46.73]Did we beat it on hardest?
[174:47.99]Yeah, the first time we did it.
[174:49.45]It was on hardest.
[174:52.15]That's why you have the level 30 items.
[174:56.28]It wasn't very hard, but then we started being rim jobs.
[174:58.86]I don't even know what this thing is.
[175:02.05]Okay, apparently it's just... Arcs?
[175:04.63]What does this one do?
[175:05.17]Oh, alright.
[175:07.63]What the fuck?
[175:09.33]What the hell is this thing?
[175:16.34]Okay, that thing is a little too weird for me to think about how to use it right now.
[175:22.78]What is it?
[175:24.25]uh it's the mirror gun the mirage yeah it's probably not good here I can't really tell if it's worth putting on
[175:55.05]I mean, I think I'm hurting things.
[175:56.51]Sort of.
[175:56.81]Oh, he's in his helicopter!
[176:18.00]It's gonna be amazing in the underground levels.
[176:19.66]Holy shit, you're right, it would be.
[176:24.77]say the underground levels but I'm pretty sure we only played one isn't there like two or three I don't remember ever doing one let's get some stuff don't come here don't come don't come
[177:05.71]There's always the one ant that causes ten buildings to be destroyed because it's just being an idiot.
[177:10.23]Yeah, because you can't find it.
[177:11.31]You can't fire at it.
[177:18.98]What?
[177:19.98]Oh, shoot it!
[177:20.94]Oh, damn it!
[177:21.80]I forgot the bullets!
[177:25.10]It's fucking useless.
[177:26.12]Something tells me you should have put bullets.
[177:33.87]Let's get some high ground.
[177:35.09]What do you say, fellers?
[177:50.04]Surprising.
[177:50.78]Mm-hmm.
[177:57.13]I see you trying to sneak over here.
[177:58.65]I'm gonna get you with the fucking mirror laser.
[178:05.31]Where are you?
[178:11.65]I wish you luck in the wars to come.
[178:19.97]This is going to bounce back and hit me, isn't it?
[178:25.39]This is very dangerous.
[178:26.41]I knew it!
[178:27.17]I knew it!
[178:27.67]Okay, I'm not using this thing anymore.
[178:32.57]Not up here.
[178:34.96]Mirage will shoot the ground You have to like be flying when you use it Blow this shit up
[179:02.96]I don't want to hit you with this.
[179:04.62]I may have called in artillery.
[179:06.32]What?
[179:06.76]Where?
[179:08.49]No, it's far enough away.
[179:18.89]You need to protect the citizens.
[179:21.17]That was a lot of artillery.
[179:22.30]Alright, I'm going to start collecting stuff.
[179:27.06]Yep.
[179:31.40]Woo!
[179:34.79]One ant left don't kill it Why does the weapon not shoot straight that's a good question, uh, I think there's only a couple more That's it.
[179:52.30]I want the armor Yeah, but it takes a long time for this mission to end Yeah, yeah, they got it.
[179:58.50]I mean, I guess if you don't want to get the kill, you know what I'm saying?
[180:00.58]It doesn't matter
[180:11.25]Oh, wow.
[180:11.45]If you think you're good at this game, I guess.
[180:13.97]That's fine.
[180:14.49]You know, you can do that if you want to.
[180:19.16]Level 42.
[180:21.72]That's great.
[180:22.72]Cool.
[180:24.04]That makes me happy.
[180:24.78]I got a 35, which we're probably not too far off of actually using.
[180:27.92]I like this plasma launcher, but I'm not going to be able to use it for a while.
[180:33.67]I don't like the reflection laser, though.
[180:36.07]I'm not a fan.
[180:37.55]We can go back now, or what do you want to do?
[180:40.94]Um, well, the whole purpose of doing this was to get 30 weapons, and I didn't get any.
[180:46.16]Okay.
[180:46.54]So, we might as well do it, like, one more time.
[180:50.06]Uh, I'm gonna try the Dynastrite X. Oh, we're doing it again.
[180:52.60]I, I, wasn't the whole purpose of that, to get weapons that I could use at their level 30?
[180:56.71]Like, 27, 28, 29?
[180:58.01]Yep.
[181:00.29]What do the armor boxes do?
[181:01.39]The armor boxes, when you pick it up, adds plus one to your maximum health.
[181:06.21]Permanently.
[181:08.68]So, you need a shitload of those.
[181:12.01]Technically, no.
[181:12.85]They add a percentage of one HP to your health.
[181:16.17]You have to pick up several, depending on your class.
[181:18.47]Okay, well, the next time I... Next time I see you in real life, both hands are going around your neck.
[181:28.06]And I'm going to fix your tie, because it was a little messed up, and I made sure I fixed it.
[181:32.16]I don't know how to tie a tie.
[181:33.72]Yeah, I bought some ties.
[181:35.78]I don't know how to tie a tie, though.
[181:36.98]I need to become a man.
[181:40.58]I've got man issues, you know?
[181:44.14]Yeah, I'm gonna make sure I fix your tie and make it look nice.
[181:46.94]Can we, like, kiss after?
[181:49.35]You'll say goodbye, honey?
[181:50.19]No, don't start this right now.
[181:52.73]Let's try the Dino Strike.
[181:55.41]Okay.
[181:56.83]I don't... It's just like a super pulse.
[182:00.75]Okay.
[182:01.49]That uses a lot of energy.
[182:02.48]Yeah, but those are the ones that shatter on the ground, I think.
[182:06.20]Because they do a lot.
[182:08.36]Yeah, they do.
[182:10.83]Well, let's give it a try.
[182:23.55]You can't aim it either when you're flying.
[182:25.25]I don't like that.
[182:29.97]I don't like it.
[182:30.95]It uses too much energy and I don't like being able to not aim it on the fly.
[182:34.61]Throw it in the bargain bin.
[182:44.87]I wanna see what it does with one like a close-up hit Oh this thing sucks
[183:07.09]at, like, close range.
[183:08.27]I just had to shoot that guy, like, three times.
[183:11.21]I know it's not designed for that, but still, that was terrible for what I was trying to use it for.
[183:15.68]Send them to hell!
[183:23.92]Are you gonna kill that thing down there?
[183:27.40]Uh, you have to do it because you can fly.
[183:30.39]It's really a pain in the ass for me to do it.
[183:33.87]Okay.
[183:39.44]Let's get some items.
[183:43.42]Dude.
[183:44.28]Hey guys in chat.
[183:45.16]Hey everybody.
[183:45.70]What's up?
[183:46.36]Star here.
[183:47.08]You like level 2?
[183:47.58]Yeah, how are you guys liking this level 2 gameplay?
[183:50.41]It's pretty exciting.
[183:54.53]If I don't get anything, then just fuck it.
[183:55.97]We'll just go on.
[183:56.55]Move on.
[183:59.27]It's just fun shooting them and seeing the new weapons.
[184:01.79]Yeah, it is.
[184:02.15]A lot of items here, but they all seem like health kits.
[184:09.18]I think they are.
[184:09.88]There's one army over here we can get.
[184:13.12]Yeah, level 2.
[184:14.42]No mechs on level 2.
[184:15.22]Yeah, it's too bad.
[184:18.25]I don't have a high level mech, but these tanks are actually level 40.
[184:21.05]Yeah, these are health packs.
[184:26.93]I didn't arc that enough.
[184:37.55]Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.
[184:41.04]Someone's car alarm?
[184:41.72]Sounds like it when you ring the doorbell.
[184:43.44]Get the beepers.
[184:45.28]Watch out!
[184:48.94]I hate this thing.
[184:51.92]I, like, really hate this thing.
[184:54.72]That uses so much energy, too!
[184:56.42]Fuck that thing.
[184:58.94]Put it in the trash can!
[185:01.26]When you get a chance!
[185:09.32]Alright, items.
[185:09.96]What do we got?
[185:13.94]Healthpack.
[185:14.44]I'm throwing artillery up there.
[185:15.86]Okay.
[185:20.86]Be brave, you pile of shit.
[185:24.95]I wish.
[185:25.41]Ooh!
[185:39.73]Be brave, you pile of shit.
[185:54.67]Hold your ground it will take time for the wing divers.
[185:57.84]Yeah, it's me.
[185:59.14]I'm here.
[186:00.38]Oh, hi What do you think I am like a kill guy think you're some type of BOGO the clown Okay, once they kill him what's PvP
[186:16.80]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[186:17.44]Make sure we got everything.
[186:18.22]Yep.
[186:21.52]Uh, we... I think we did.
[186:23.84]Alright.
[186:24.15]PvP?
[186:26.17]When did we get the PvP?
[186:27.91]PvP.
[186:28.41]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not yet.
[186:29.49]Not yet, yeah.
[186:29.79]I didn't know we were ready.
[186:30.37]We gotta get that item.
[186:31.91]Behind you.
[186:32.21]Just get it.
[186:32.63]Alright.
[186:38.33]PvP.
[186:39.97]Ready?
[186:40.47]One, two, three, go.
[186:45.06]I hope we don't get anything.
[186:49.01]I hope you die a horrible death.
[186:52.26]I got a level 3, I got a level 10, and I got a level 8.
[186:56.24]I got a 32 and a 35, so this is all completely pointless.
[187:01.71]Oh, we also got a whole bunch of armor, so don't say it was completely pointless.
[187:04.05]We got like fucking 60 armor.
[187:05.71]Cool.
[187:07.11]Cool.
[187:08.23]That's not going to help us in the wars to come.
[187:13.66]But I take the Dynastrike off.
[187:15.30]I like the Plasma Launcher, but I can't even use any of this shit.
[187:20.67]Yeah.
[187:21.13]No, I don't want that either.
[187:27.55]Gosh.
[187:28.49]Damn it.
[187:29.71]Well, it's back to the rapier.
[187:32.31]Oh, we have an underground mission here.
[187:34.29]Underground mission.
[187:35.25]Good thing I can't use that thing.
[187:37.01]Because it's level 40, like, fucking whatever it is.
[187:39.13]Wait, is it?
[187:41.24]What was that thing?
[187:41.94]What was it even called?
[187:43.82]Reflection laser.
[187:44.44]Yeah, 32.
[187:45.30]Can't use it.
[187:47.68]What's our max level right now?
[187:48.84]30.
[187:50.20]30.
[187:50.28]Okay.
[187:57.48]I understand.
[187:59.08]Yes.
[187:59.54]I understand.
[188:00.10]Yes.
[188:01.08]Yes.
[188:03.80]Armor limit, 1,000.
[188:05.70]I'm glad that I have like 18% of that.
[188:12.01]I guess I'm ready.
[188:12.63]I'm not.
[188:14.17]Just turn the level limit off, you doofus.
[188:17.77]I mean... Can't.
[188:20.11]But, like, that's... Is that, like... Is that, like, considered, like, cheating, kind of?
[188:27.35]Is that considered, like, BM?
[188:28.37]What do you mean you can't?
[188:31.79]I don't know why that option's even there, because it doesn't let you select it.
[188:35.82]Unless it's, like, something you're only allowed to do in easy or some shit.
[188:39.80]So you can't take off the level limit.
[188:42.34]No.
[188:43.24]Okay.
[188:43.64]Well, that answers your guy's question.
[188:45.40]He can't do it.
[188:47.40]Thank you, Colunes, for the sub.
[188:50.20]Chinsaur, thanks for subbing as well.
[188:52.62]CubeA is able 23 thanks to three months.
[188:55.88]Gun sucks.
[188:56.82]It kind of did.
[188:58.88]You need to beat every mission on every difficulty to unlock that option.
[189:03.36]Apparently.
[189:06.58]We need at least 70% completion, so we can't do it.
[189:13.58]MJ, Kolo, Luka, thanks for the sub.
[189:17.50]Also, not always Carlos.
[189:19.77]He's not always Carl, but sometimes he is.
[189:21.77]Thanks for the sub.
[189:26.31]Maybe they added that since I played.
[189:27.97]It's been grayed out for us, so I'm not sure.
[189:33.45]Oh, damn it.
[189:35.89]Yeah, I can't even use a tank this level, so I'm just going to do something else.
[189:40.07]Well, if we're underground, that's probably not a great idea anyways.
[189:47.71]What's my favorite hot dog?
[189:50.55]Uh... I don't know.
[189:54.14]Condiment-wise?
[189:55.90]Plain-ass mustard.
[189:57.08]That's it.
[189:58.98]One perfect line of yellow mustard.
[190:01.24]That's it.
[190:03.50]Don't dump it in the bun and get it all messy and gooky and mooky.
[190:06.61]You know what I mean?
[190:07.21]Just one perfect line on top of the dog.
[190:10.61]Nothing else.
[190:11.05]Don't stuff it in there.
[190:11.91]That's gross.
[190:12.53]Hey, Darth Buff Crust.
[190:14.69]Don't have a depth crawler.
[190:19.26]Don't have a what?
[190:21.39]You wouldn't understand.
[190:22.15]I guess they're already here.
[190:28.03]That's underground.
[190:33.18]This thing's actually going to be great in here.
[190:34.58]Just fills up the hole.
[190:41.62]What the hell are you doing?
[190:43.73]I died.
[190:45.71]What do you mean you died?
[190:46.57]Why are you playing Fencer?
[190:49.75]Because I can't... If I'm in a tank here or anything.
[190:54.94]How are we going to do this?
[190:56.54]You're going to get hit once and die.
[191:03.34]I didn't get hit once and died.
[191:04.48]I shot myself with a fucking really powerful rocket launcher.
[191:07.56]Oh, well, that changes things, I guess.
[191:22.11]Alright, I need weapons.
[191:23.83]No, just a health pack.
[191:25.49]Now.
[191:25.77]Watch your fire, soldier.
[191:48.41]There's not many bodies in this game.
[191:50.63]I can't even see.
[191:51.95]I don't even know how, who's, this is the one, okay, there was one that was alive just sitting in there.
[191:57.93]Somehow.
[191:59.27]Oh my god, Fencer's sword is fucking really good.
[192:02.97]I underestimated it.
[192:04.05]Be careful though, you're hurt.
[192:07.21]I killed like six things with one swing.
[192:09.73]Did you though?
[192:16.90]I think I hit myself.
[192:22.49]Unfortunately, I don't have 1,000 armor.
[192:26.23]No, you don't.
[192:28.39]You do not.
[192:29.21]And I'm, like, shooting you farther away.
[192:32.43]Come back to me.
[192:33.41]Ooh, there's a weapon.
[192:39.01]Did you just shoot me in the back?
[192:39.91]Did I?
[192:41.76]Yeah, you did.
[192:44.53]You did.
[192:44.95]Let's go this way.
[192:45.65]And I don't want you to go first because I don't want you to die.
[192:48.47]But if you're just going to shoot me in the back... I have a shield.
[192:59.81]Jesus, that scares me when you do that.
[193:08.27]Oh my god, get these fucking things out of the way, please.
[193:14.77]Where's your heal gun?
[193:16.65]I can't heal you, you're not a vehicle.
[193:21.64]Oh man, I love this new weapon.
[193:25.92]Stand behind me for a second.
[193:26.92]I don't want to shoot you with this.
[193:31.44]Okay.
[193:35.34]Uh, did you get him?
[193:36.76]Can I go in now?
[193:38.50]Hold up.
[193:39.70]You look like you are struggling to carry this stuff.
[193:44.74]You're heavy on the left side.
[193:48.04]I'm going in.
[193:58.85]Commander, I will protect you, soldier!
[194:00.83]There's a lot of health and shit in here that I want to grab.
[194:10.42]This weapon is so disgusting.
[194:13.53]I actually really would like to play Fenster.
[194:15.49]I just feel like unless I play for like five hours and collect armor, it's not worth it.
[194:21.38]Somebody filled the toilet with toilet paper.
[194:23.16]We can't flush it.
[194:24.80]There we go.
[194:25.34]Nice drain clog.
[194:33.53]Yeah.
[194:43.90]Easy Easy Yeah, I gotta give him the drain off I backed up if you could just bring them to that corner I think I'll shoot I think they're just gonna come on their own I think I Don't have anything long range so This place is too narrow for this weapon I'm really not helping that much
[195:10.56]um are they even coming in uh I think here they come now yeah who are they fighting is there random dudes over there just in there alright I'm gonna alright wish me luck I'm going for a psycho move you ready to be a psycho I won't be able to resurrect you well be careful to not shoot me there's a bunch of health that just dropped over there
[195:40.41]Back up, back up, back up.
[195:46.11]Alright, I'm going in.
[195:47.51]Watch out.
[195:48.07]Don't shoot me.
[195:51.45]What the fuck?!
[195:52.59]I just told you not to shoot!
[195:53.61]You told me not to shoot!
[195:54.75]I just told you not to shoot!
[195:58.21]Yeah.
[195:59.68]It was a shot.
[196:00.16]You shoot me!
[196:01.66]Okay, I can't... I'm actually really surprised you did.
[196:03.54]I can't go in if you're gonna do that.
[196:06.44]Are you fucking crazy?! !
[196:08.91]There's a whole bunch of health kits there, I've heard.
[196:11.15]Yeah, there is, but when you fill the hole with fire and shoot me, it's not easy for me to get it.
[196:16.81]I'm just going to hug the left wall.
[196:26.72]Jeez, you are scaring the shit out of me right now.
[196:29.65]Don't shoot.
[196:31.15]This was a really bad weapon choice, I know.
[196:35.31]Other than that, I have the sword, but that's like the same thing, because that's a big AoE slash.
[196:39.37]Oh my goodness, I'm not going to be able to get you.
[196:41.15]No, we should probably restart.
[196:44.48]No.
[196:46.36]You know who restarts?
[196:47.48]They're all on the ground.
[196:48.90]I did not think they were all going to be on the ground.
[196:50.46]I thought they were going to be like to the left.
[196:52.86]There's like a huge hole here.
[197:04.65]Okay.
[197:06.88]I thought there was going to be like a left tunnel and a right tunnel, not a gigantic hole.
[197:15.89]But I'm going to do this.
[197:17.33]I don't have a weapon class that will kill everything in front of me.
[197:22.13]Where's the tooth cleaning?
[197:25.27]No, I don't want the tooth cleaner.
[197:26.57]Maybe I do.
[197:27.09]Actually, I do.
[197:28.80]I want the dentist gun.
[197:31.50]Yeah.
[197:35.66]Acid gun in the caves?
[197:37.68]That's not a bad idea, but you're going to get too close, I think.
[197:41.20]This will be good.
[197:41.82]The dentist weapon will be good because I can just stay back and just unload.
[197:46.64]Oh, yeah.
[197:48.44]Unload.
[197:50.26]The reflection laser.
[197:51.86]I would love to use that here, but I can't because it's level 32.
[198:00.35]I picked a long thing.
[198:04.21]You tend to do that.
[198:10.03]Alright, I have to pick Titanfall.
[198:15.31]Stand tall for Turtle Crawl.
[198:17.25]I know.
[198:20.66]Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[198:22.82]Do you have the Dentist gun?
[198:25.20]And the Super Bomb.
[198:26.62]Good, that means we can just be the Dentist.
[198:36.23]Wow, this is much better.
[198:39.64]This is better now that I don't have to worry about getting shot in the back by a giant rocket.
[198:43.48]Yeah.
[198:46.26]Yeah.
[198:50.04]Hey, did you know that this person has the same amount of armor as my, uh, what's-a-ma-doodle?
[198:55.58]What's-a-ma-doodle?
[198:57.76]Like, I've played this character enough that if I play Fencer, I have the same amount of armor as the character that's supposed to have the least armor.
[199:06.11]Okay, this people's still alive, but we can't tell, because there's too many dead in the hole.
[199:11.07]This is so stupid.
[199:17.72]Alright, so you know what this is?
[199:19.52]I do left side, you do right side.
[199:23.04]We have- oh my god.
[199:24.88]You have clogged drains?
[199:26.72]Yeah, this- okay, when you pour Drano down your drain, this is just cut to this, this is what happens.
[199:33.20]We have to keep stuffing them down.
[199:35.56]Keep flushing them.
[199:41.31]The pile of shit and dirt is almost through the drain.
[199:43.79]Drano works.
[199:49.66]Drano sure does work.
[199:51.06]Hey, can you stop mortaring me in the back?
[200:00.18]Oh, this is so dumb.
[200:01.22]Alright, hold on.
[200:01.66]Wait, did we miss any items or anything?
[200:02.70]No.
[200:07.89]Hold on, wait for the other Drano guy.
[200:20.97]This really is very dumb.
[200:22.25]Double Drano.
[200:23.95]Double Dentist, double Drano.
[200:29.76]I'm glad they finally made a spin-off of my favorite TV show.
[200:33.05]Double Dentist.
[200:34.13]Yeah, this is a spin-off to Double Dentist.
[200:39.61]There's one more alive in there.
[200:41.05]Oh, he's dead.
[200:41.51]Okay.
[200:47.79]Yeah, we're in, like, somebody's intestines right now.
[200:50.17]All the bugs represent, like, the junk food.
[200:53.27]Like, the hamburgers, the chicken nuggets, and we are the laxative.
[200:58.53]Alright, hold on.
[200:59.47]They're all down deep in the hole.
[201:01.53]The hole just drops the whole way.
[201:06.73]So this is actually going to be tricky.
[201:10.25]Hello?
[201:10.77]Did you see that guy?
[201:11.75]Hey, there's people up there!
[201:14.96]We just need to tactically... You know what?
[201:17.36]You're probably better off just... Let me do some bombing.
[201:20.20]Just kitty corner.
[201:22.90]And eventually we'll be able to dump it up down there.
[201:28.14]I'm gonna go to the other side.
[201:30.78]Careful.
[201:45.59]I think we're alright.
[201:47.27]There's one or two more over there.
[201:49.57]Now they're down.
[201:50.25]Oh shit, what happened to you?
[201:52.47]That was bound to happen.
[201:53.67]What'd you do, shoot yourself?
[201:55.09]Yeah.
[201:55.63]There's not many left though.
[202:06.17]There's a lot of items down there too, just don't do anything stupid, I guess.
[202:13.97]It's safe!
[202:15.97]Yay!
[202:21.02]Get full health if you can down here before we leave.
[202:23.82]There's a lot of health.
[202:26.94]These missions are a nice change of pace from, you know, from the usual, like, you know, the dining and the diners, drive-ins and dives that we're used to.
[202:36.80]Uh, what's this last thing?
[202:40.30]Man, that sauce?
[202:41.06]Totally out of the park, man.
[202:43.72]Whoa, killer.
[202:51.50]What, you make this sauce here?
[202:53.07]What, man?
[202:54.23]Right here, man, bump it.
[202:55.47]We're here outside of Mama John's.
[203:04.37]Let's go I don't take easy.
[203:07.45]I'm like getting into joke mode and I want to be like halfway through this Well, I don't want to die in joke.
[203:13.11]We gotta kill these things on the left Mama John's Would be a good name for a restaurant
[203:30.35]Mama John's.
[203:32.31]Alright.
[203:33.11]Oh, I know why that sounds.
[203:34.49]Yeah, that's why.
[203:35.47]Why is that something?
[203:36.07]Sounds like Papa John's.
[203:39.71]Jeremiah says something funny.
[203:40.75]Haha, coffee, chicken, Doritos.
[203:47.73]Doritos, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew, soda.
[203:54.09]Whoa, what hurt me?
[203:56.57]Did someone shoot me through the wall?
[204:00.15]What the fuck is happening?
[204:02.68]Remember the first time you were scared of spiders?
[204:04.74]You were like, wow, my phobia of aerobics is there.
[204:07.86]Yeah, my aerobics phobia.
[204:09.12]Yep.
[204:13.96]He said it.
[204:14.52]Oh, no.
[204:14.90]No.
[204:16.65]Alright.
[204:17.37]No, we're not doing the coffee chicken, coffee Cheetos joke.
[204:22.01]There's nothing in here in this game that doesn't warrant us talking about that.
[204:28.55]Easy.
[204:29.99]Slow it down.
[204:30.76]Your other drain cleaner is not with you.
[204:35.02]I can't see anything.
[204:36.74]Apparently there's bad guys in there, right?
[204:43.67]I'm going to hold it down in there.
[204:50.25]Okay.
[204:50.65]Oh, there they are.
[204:51.97]They're red ants.
[204:53.02]Take out drain cleaner.
[204:53.74]Drain, drain, drain, drain, drain.
[204:56.38]Just back up.
[204:57.70]No, back up.
[204:58.46]Fuck that.
[204:58.88]Keep them right there.
[204:59.82]So they stuff in the fucking tunnel.
[205:01.68]Back up so you don't explode.
[205:03.18]I'm not that close.
[205:13.17]You are just slaughtering everybody on our team.
[205:17.65]Well, I told them to back up.
[205:20.33]They're just melting into...
[205:26.99]Hey, look at that!
[205:28.01]Oh, there's one more!
[205:28.65]Wait, don't get cocky.
[205:29.66]There's one where it's hiding in the bodies.
[205:34.52]I'm not... Stop.
[205:35.96]I just want... I need to push the... Look at all this fucking... Yeah, suck it all up.
[205:39.88]Ah, nice.
[205:43.04]I love just drinking these health packs and armor packs.
[205:47.18]There's one more in here.
[205:49.50]So if we go down all the way to the bottom, do we get to fight the fucking four kings?
[205:53.83]I don't know.
[205:55.75]But there's one more and it's at the bottom.
[205:57.35]And I'm scared that it's like a giant crab or something.
[205:59.73]Alright, I'm going down.
[206:01.73]No, it's just a regular beetle.
[206:03.45]Ant thing.
[206:06.10]How far down does this go?
[206:07.08]It feels sort of silly that there'd be that much level for no reason.
[206:13.10]okay no new items I just got such a massive amount of new things that I'm going to be overwhelmed here for the next like 30 minutes not a single new thing for me almost every single thing is new and every not only is every single thing here new it's all better than everything I have like 22 25 26 25. oh yeah yeah okay this is gonna take a second
[206:44.21]Four-way... Look at this thing.
[206:47.69]That actually was a good mission for farming, because everything dies in the tunnel.
[206:50.89]It doesn't get scattered out, and it was really easy to just, you know, push the poop through.
[206:54.76]You know, be like a turd stuffer.
[206:56.46]You know what I'm talking about?
[206:57.20]Like a fudge packer, they call them.
[206:59.80]Okay, come on.
[207:00.66]Come on.
[207:02.12]Don't get them... You're gonna get them all going.
[207:05.73]Now they're all gonna start saying that.
[207:07.89]Because you just said that, and now they're gonna start saying it.
[207:10.25]Here we go.
[207:10.93]I'm waiting.
[207:11.31]Stream delay.
[207:11.65]Stream delay.
[207:15.53]Alright.
[207:16.47]I done D custom.
[207:19.33]Upgraded I done electric shotgun.
[207:22.14]Revamped for greater output.
[207:23.12]Its firepower and rate of fire have been boosted significantly, making it a super weapon to be reckoned with.
[207:29.48]Okay.
[207:30.92]You don't call something a super weapon and have me not want it.
[207:35.42]Wait, what is it called?
[207:37.30]The I-Dun-D Custom.
[207:39.68]Yeah, it's like an electroshock rifle bow thing.
[207:42.44]I don't know what that is.
[207:44.48]Oh, I know what that is.
[207:46.00]Four-way.
[207:46.48]Where's the other one I got that was like level 20-something?
[207:53.03]Didn't I get like a 26?
[207:58.15]I can lift this 25 and I already have that one.
[207:59.71]Here we go.
[207:59.99]I know that's the one I have on.
[208:09.40]I done A. What the fuck is that?
[208:11.82]Why is it level 1 too?
[208:17.30]I think I'm good.
[208:18.07]I don't think I want to try any of this new shit.
[208:21.35]Except for the one I just put on.
[208:22.55]Because I like the rape here.
[208:24.88]The rapiers look incredible, that's what I was telling you.
[208:26.72]I used it in most missions we did because it shreds everything.
[208:29.58]Oh, Jesus.
[208:30.12]Okay.
[208:30.62]Fuck.
[208:31.08]Alright.
[208:31.48]I didn't even know that was possible.
[208:33.52]This game just... Wow.
[208:36.17]That's why I said earlier, Jerma.
[208:38.47]That there's... No, no, no, no, no.
[208:39.69]I'm talking about, like, scrolling down.
[208:42.33]Yes.
[208:43.53]That's why I said earlier not to get level 1 items because it's just annoying to scroll down to the good ones.
[208:49.74]Because you have a whole bunch of level 0s and level 3s.
[208:52.66]But my point is I haven't had enough items in the game yet to be able to physically do this.
[208:57.30]Yeah, now you're going to know how annoying it is.
[208:58.94]And you're going to wish you didn't have level 5s.
[209:00.96]Yeah, but that's cool to scroll down.
[209:04.64]That's the first time I've ever seen this, guys.
[209:06.00]Come on, give me a goddamn break.
[209:07.26]Give me a goddamn break.
[209:10.03]Okay, I'm gonna try a plasma fall.
[209:11.97]Let's give it a try.
[209:12.59]Why not?
[209:12.86]Let's just try the 225.
[209:15.08]Do I even play video games?
[209:16.38]No, I don't.
[209:17.74]This person just called me a fucking idiot.
[209:19.58]I want their, uh... I want them to get a one-second ban.
[209:27.07]Good luck finding that person because, like, 25 people just said it.
[209:32.61]I didn't even know that was a thing.
[209:33.59]Alright, we're good.
[209:38.78]Give me a break!
[209:39.60]Come on, I didn't even know you could do that shit!
[209:48.91]Pan that guy for one second.
[209:50.73]Except if you're gonna find the guy, because it's gonna take, like, everyone who's been calling me an idiot.
[209:57.98]It was me!
[210:05.61]Are you ready?
[210:08.99]Um, yeah, I'm gonna try a weird weapon Send it to the gallows Okay, I love you guys you guys are fucking fun What about me?
[210:32.33]Now, like, you have fun, but I like all my friends in chat.
[210:36.43]Whoa, wait.
[210:37.85]Oh, God.
[210:38.23]That is such a huge arc.
[210:41.33]That's such a huge arc.
[210:43.47]What does this thing do?
[210:44.37]Oh, my God.
[210:47.53]Okay, I found my favorite.
[210:48.87]This is my favorite item.
[210:50.37]Because it's the Ghostbusters weapon.
[210:53.47]It takes a long time to reload, but... Yeah.
[210:58.26]I don't know what any of my weapons do, and I'm just so lost and confused.
[211:04.60]Do we fly up into the fucking way they're coming from?
[211:06.72]That's what I'm doing.
[211:11.72]So much shit is on this screen, man.
[211:15.78]Wow.
[211:19.16]This other one does not seem to be working sufficiently for me.
[211:26.27]This is just total chaos.
[211:32.34]Holy shit, that's such a huge blast, too.
[211:44.73]That's gonna be hard to get used to that, though.
[211:53.82]Oh, shit!
[211:54.94]I need health.
[211:56.00]There's health right there.
[211:57.68]And lots of it.
[212:02.69]Fuck, get away from me.
[212:04.43]Another health.
[212:07.07]Fly up there please.
[212:13.87]Yikes.
[212:18.57]This is too much.
[212:20.73]I'm just like... What happened to the lights?
[212:23.83]How did you... Did you just do something to turn the lights on?
[212:26.65]What?
[212:27.53]The whole place just lit up for me.
[212:28.67]I don't know.
[212:34.53]I'm dead, though.
[212:35.39]You're dead?
[212:36.53]Yeah.
[212:36.67]He's on the ground?
[212:38.05]Yeah.
[212:38.25]I'm going to get you.
[212:40.67]I am not... I am not prepared.
[212:42.61]Holy shit.
[212:54.14]There's so many more coming right now.
[212:55.92]Do you see the fucking mini-map?
[213:00.74]Jesus Christ.
[213:02.64]Oh, yeah, I'm not going to be any help.
[213:10.68]This is just a fucking nightmare.
[213:13.03]It's a fucking nightmare.
[213:16.67]I'm dead.
[213:18.23]Okay, I'm going to pick something that can help you.
[213:20.83]I was truly and utterly useless, so if you were doing well, congratulations.
[213:25.82]I was killing a shitload of things, but that was a nightmare.
[213:31.32]A lot of things are dying, but at the same time... You know what that... Okay, here's what that was.
[213:35.96]That was the very end of the haunted house.
[213:38.96]When all the monsters are coming up from behind the curtains, and there's just lights flashing, and you're trying to sprint because your heart's racing, you just want to get to the end of the haunted house.
[213:47.36]And every time you look over, there's like another flash in the fucking monster's face, and you keep running.
[213:51.34]Stop that, please!
[213:53.99]Stop that now.
[213:55.85]You're just hurting people's ears.
[213:58.39]Can we play it?
[214:03.30]If only I could use the infinite reflection laser, I know.
[214:06.06]Was this level 30 or 32?
[214:09.89]I'm just going up and I'm aiming into this hole.
[214:17.69]I like this strategy.
[214:19.75]This strategy works for me.
[214:27.72]Oh my god.
[214:33.19]Okay, now you want to talk about levels to farm on?
[214:35.57]Yeah, this one.
[214:36.77]You get four people and everybody aim down one of these tunnels?
[214:40.59]Yeah, dude, get... This is exactly how we need to do this, by the way.
[214:44.13]Just stay on that tunnel.
[214:45.09]Just aim at both tunnels.
[214:46.51]They'll never be able to come out, ever.
[214:58.58]Oh, they just all spawned on me.
[215:00.48]There's so many coming in here now.
[215:04.08]Oh, here comes the nightmare.
[215:05.16]There's so many things right here.
[215:13.67]There's just a pile of boxes at the bottom of this tunnel for me.
[215:24.31]There's so many ants.
[215:29.27]I'm so paranoid about running out of ammo that I keep reloading at the worst possible times.
[215:36.04]Alright, I'm going on item collection now.
[215:39.32]Watch out if they spawn on you.
[215:40.94]They did it to me.
[215:41.74]It's just... I think I got the... I gotta stop talking.
[215:47.91]Hold on.
[215:59.15]Please don't spawn on me.
[215:59.85]Please don't spawn on me.
[216:00.45]Please don't spawn on me.
[216:02.04]Please don't spawn on me.
[216:03.72]Don't spawn on me.
[216:06.71]Okay, you want to do this mission like 10 more times?
[216:15.14]Give me this last box!
[216:16.62]Nice, I got it.
[216:17.46]Look at that stuff that was right there.
[216:20.70]Okay, um... Oh, and you know those, um... I don't know if you've unlocked any of them yet.
[216:27.10]The, uh... The things that you can throw out and they just shoot a bunch of shots over and over and over and over again.
[216:34.49]Dude, the V-laser could hit both tunnels.
[216:38.28]Too bad I can't use it.
[216:39.58]Holy shit, that'd be incredible.
[216:40.64]But say that again.
[216:41.42]Sorry, I wasn't paying attention to what you were saying.
[216:44.06]Your special weapon that you get on this character is the ball that you throw that shoots a whole bunch of lasers everywhere.
[216:49.04]Right.
[216:50.15]You just throw it down the tunnel.
[216:51.23]I think if they touch the source of it, it goes away, though.
[216:54.17]Well, that's an amazing thing to farm because we just need to be... How much armor did we get at the end of that?
[216:59.29]I didn't look.
[217:00.49]We didn't have time to collect anything.
[217:02.91]Oh, I collected everything on my side.
[217:05.05]I got as much as I could, but I was still missing one or two things.
[217:09.22]Are we doing giant robots?
[217:13.54]Or are we going to do that one again?
[217:15.52]Do you want to do that one again?
[217:17.59]Let's just go.
[217:18.25]Let's just see.
[217:19.53]Once we hit another wall, we'll come back here.
[217:22.85]Okay.
[217:24.39]I like this combo of items, though.
[217:26.87]No, fuck.
[217:27.81]No, did you pick the wrong thing again?
[217:31.77]I meant to click change class and I just clicked okay.
[217:35.35]I still have the thing equipped from last round.
[217:36.97]I wanted to switch back to artillery man.
[217:38.89]Alright, you guys can call me like the dumb guy, but he's done like the I picked the wrong class, wrong loadout like 50 fucking times.
[217:49.02]Very close to 50.
[217:50.36]At least 30.
[217:51.08]Also, this mission will not load, so it's twice as painful.
[218:03.44]I'm ready.
[218:03.86]I'm ready to go.
[218:10.32]Thank you, Sifo24 and Vinister for your subs.
[218:15.26]Did I miss any more subs?
[218:16.00]Let me make sure I didn't.
[218:17.72]HappyPants for nine months.
[218:18.72]I don't want to miss HappyPants.
[218:20.15]It's a nine-month subscription.
[218:21.39]Thanks a lot, dude.
[218:25.95]Thanks for the sub.
[218:28.51]Hope you're enjoying the stream.
[218:37.52]Oh, wait.
[218:37.82]Oh, my God.
[218:38.48]You didn't.
[218:38.88]Did you do it again?
[218:39.40]You did it again, didn't you?
[218:41.14]No, I didn't.
[218:41.96]Got him.
[218:43.00]Acting.
[218:43.52]He's lying.
[218:44.58]Because he's going to go back to the main menu right now.
[218:45.90]And it's going to be like the joke that he's pretending to do.
[218:52.46]Swear to God if you go back to the menu.
[218:56.36]Swear to God.
[219:00.86]You go back to that main menu, dude.
[219:03.06]And I'm going to fix your tie real tight.
[219:11.59]Now we're good.
[219:13.27]Okay.
[219:18.79]How far does that go?
[219:19.55]Is that hitting him?
[219:21.05]I think it is.
[219:21.55]This gun is fucking incredible.
[219:23.81]Can you stop shooting him for one second?
[219:24.93]I want to try this weapon.
[219:26.83]Don't ever let me take this off, guys.
[219:29.87]Oh.
[219:30.09]What the hell is that?
[219:31.79]Almost spider.
[219:33.80]This weapon is unbelievable.
[219:36.68]God, I hope I get an upgraded version of this thing because it's so long range.
[219:50.26]I need to... I'm getting way too overzealous here.
[219:54.16]Kind of being a dummy.
[219:58.36]I love the Ghostbusters.
[219:59.28]We're, like, surrounded.
[220:00.13]Yeah, we kind of are.
[220:02.95]We kill, like, the... Go, like, down the main road.
[220:04.55]Because we, like, killed everything over there.
[220:08.43]We need to just keep moving.
[220:09.37]And, like, get enough distance.
[220:16.57]Alright, which one do you want to go for next?
[220:18.15]How about this dude?
[220:24.22]I don't even want to use the other weapon.
[220:33.87]We'll be there soon.
[220:36.91]How did we get this surrounded, man?
[220:39.40]Whoever our general is is like a complete moron.
[220:43.24]Yeah, here's a plan.
[220:45.36]You see all the guys, all those giant robots coming into the city?
[220:48.96]Stand in the middle.
[220:51.33]Gives us the best place for victory.
[220:53.25]Gives us the best way to do it.
[220:55.25]Then we can turn in all directions and shoot in every direction.
[220:57.71]And we'll at least have enough to buy a bow.
[220:59.71]Ooh.
[221:00.69]Watch this one.
[221:02.05]Slam dunk.
[221:03.49]Nope.
[221:07.05]Bam.
[221:09.19]I will take care of the items.
[221:10.33]You keep moving.
[221:13.57]I'm going to take care of the shooting.
[221:16.43]You do that.
[221:20.70]There's a lot grouped up.
[221:21.77]Do you have an artillery?
[221:22.67]Because look, there's like four right here.
[221:27.21]That would be a good place for an artillery.
[221:29.44]Oh, come on.
[221:30.44]I only have the whale.
[221:31.84]Oh...
[221:36.65]That really would.
[221:37.27]Like, if I actually had a decent artillery, I haven't found one yet.
[221:40.02]You hit that one guy right in the head with a rock.
[221:43.56]That's what that was.
[221:45.94]I've only been playing this class on the missions where, like, you don't get anything.
[221:53.35]I don't even need to use the other weapon.
[221:54.51]This thing is too good.
[221:55.49]If I could have this and the slime gun, I'd be sitting pretty.
[222:07.10]I got a lot of items to collect.
[222:08.94]We've been surrounded again.
[222:10.02]We've been surrounded again, haven't we?
[222:23.25]Give me that, give me that, give me that.
[222:24.31]Don't want to be careful.
[222:27.93]Don't fly to them.
[222:28.65]I am flying back.
[222:40.99]Damn, he's still alive.
[222:50.79]There's a lot of items I need to get, but I don't really have an opportunity to get them.
[222:53.99]How many cities do we have?
[222:58.30]Yeah, we do have a lot.
[222:59.64]I can't get in there and get them.
[223:00.58]It's not safe.
[223:05.00]That's not safe.
[223:06.24]I'm going to have to wait.
[223:07.06]Wait until we have one left and then let's go around and get everything.
[223:17.02]Ow.
[223:20.20]Nooo!
[223:21.21]You were right next to me!
[223:32.39]Whoa, whoa!
[223:35.94]What just happened?
[223:36.66]What just happened to me?
[223:37.70]What, did you just drop an artillery on my head in the building?
[223:39.76]Nope.
[223:40.62]I wasn't even looking over that way.
[223:43.28]I got, I like walked into the building and then I just fucking went to zero.
[223:49.35]um might be kind of hard to get to you I I genuinely don't know what the hell just happened to me who knows right I don't have enough armor yeah I've heard that excuse acting you I was against the building and it just hit the building that was great aim
[224:21.69]yeah you can have a lot of trouble coming to get me you're perfectly in almost all of them but apparently if you're driving a tank they can't hit you because what is like aiming in front of a target that's moving you got combo
[224:36.44]Oh, I think one of the mechs I just saw on the ground did, like, a nuclear explosion, like, a minute after it was already on the ground.
[224:44.08]Maybe that's, you were just, like, near something like that.
[224:46.52]I don't think so.
[224:47.40]I was, like, in the air.
[224:48.14]I was, I, I walked, like, back flew into a building.
[224:50.62]It's, it's very big explosion.
[224:52.98]It could reach the top of these skyscrapers.
[224:54.62]Well, you have a pretty good opportunity.
[224:55.52]Yeah, after they've been on the ground for a while, it's blowing up.
[224:57.52]I'm coming back to you.
[224:58.22]Yeah, if you come over here.
[224:58.90]I'm driving down Item Street.
[225:00.20]Hold on.
[225:04.18]Charge the plasma ball.
[225:05.24]Oh, I didn't know you could do that.
[225:06.18]I'll do it.
[225:13.08]I can see your laser.
[225:13.74]You were pointing at me.
[225:14.74]That's how I knew you were coming for me.
[225:17.29]I think I honestly just got hit by like three of those at the same time.
[225:19.73]Those purple blasts.
[225:25.93]Oh, they're raining fire.
[225:27.51]Oh, that's... You're gonna get me and it's gonna stay!
[225:35.60]Nope.
[225:36.24]I couldn't get out.
[225:39.62]I took off in the air and just got instantly comboed.
[225:44.45]Well, that was a waste of time.
[225:45.77]Yeah, apparently it was.
[225:52.29]I tried to fly.
[225:53.20]Nope.
[225:54.90]Instantly dead.
[225:56.34]That's great.
[225:58.07]You know what I shouldn't have done is come to Jerma.
[225:59.95]Well, you know what shouldn't have happened is I shouldn't have got insta-combo to death two times.
[226:03.75]That would have been really not great.
[226:12.34]That was a long mission too.
[226:16.08]Yeah.
[226:18.57]Alright, well.
[226:24.47]How do you charge the plasma fall?
[226:27.53]You hold the button down or something?
[226:29.39]Oh, you have plasma fall?
[226:30.43]Yeah, how do you charge that weapon?
[226:32.23]You can't.
[226:32.87]You're an idiot.
[226:33.89]Wait, so you can't... What just... What?
[226:40.96]That went so fucking fast.
[226:48.36]I'm taking it back a little right now.
[227:00.18]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[227:02.32]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[227:03.85]I wish that guy would get the fuck out.
[227:05.25]I wish the dead guy would get out of the way.
[227:06.65]That would be sure cool.
[227:09.21]That fucking idiot that's dead wouldn't stuck to the guy alive.
[227:11.73]That would be sure cool.
[227:15.11]It sure would be sure cool.
[227:16.33]It's gonna sit here.
[227:22.09]Apparently I ran out of shit.
[227:31.37]That was a huge amount of weapons to get.
[227:34.11]Alright, where are you?
[227:34.57]I'm coming to you.
[227:40.19]I'm just driving, you know?
[227:44.57]Well, that would've been bad if that hit me.
[227:55.94]You are like a bug.
[227:56.88]I am kind of just a bug, aren't I?
[228:02.05]More like a boar.
[228:05.13]A bug boar?
[228:08.61]My framerate just died.
[228:10.73]We're kind of getting surrounded.
[228:13.21]We're kind of getting surrounded.
[228:17.80]That's the whole premise.
[228:18.94]Yeah, I mean, but like more so than we were last time, even.
[228:27.38]Crap!
[228:37.77]Big guy over here.
[228:41.23]Don't hit me with that.
[228:42.13]I beg you.
[228:45.29]Hit him right into the bridge.
[228:46.31]He didn't even know I'm there.
[228:52.11]Didn't even know I was there.
[228:57.19]Am I an anime boy?
[229:03.27]Are you?
[229:04.79]Is that the role I'm playing?
[229:05.73]I don't know.
[229:09.59]Is that the role you want to be playing?
[229:12.24]I mean, I think I'd be more anime.
[229:14.24]Okay, shit.
[229:14.86]Now I'm getting what's going on here with this gun.
[229:20.14]This takes a long time to reload, and it drains you when you reload, so I can't do that shit.
[229:24.32]Coming over to you.
[229:33.76]Boink.
[229:39.92]Let's get there to be like one or two left.
[229:43.42]Do what we gotta do.
[229:44.42]How are you on health?
[229:50.11]I only have two howitzer shots.
[229:51.45]Watch out.
[229:52.51]He just like came out of nowhere sprinting.
[229:57.13]Whoa, what the fuck?
[229:58.23]You gotta fucking give it to like the bullshit.
[230:01.93]Come on.
[230:02.53]Come on now.
[230:03.51]What is happening?
[230:06.17]What is... Why are you... Why are you... Where are they... I don't understand.
[230:13.15]I feel like this is what happened to me last time.
[230:14.61]I swear to God.
[230:16.83]Somebody just teleported to me.
[230:18.51]Had to be.
[230:18.83]I'm going to use that.
[230:19.33]I'm going to blame on it.
[230:19.91]I'm going to put the blame on that.
[230:25.13]I don't have a tank for a while.
[230:27.05]I'm useless.
[230:29.05]Well... You're not 100%.
[230:32.11]They're moving so much faster now.
[230:37.40]The commander was killed.
[230:38.24]Jesus Christ.
[230:42.08]Okay, honestly, is it just me or did they... their speed increased by like three times.
[230:45.84]Look at these guys.
[230:49.34]What?
[230:49.64]Maybe.
[230:50.14]Fuck.
[230:56.38]Something clicked in this game and they decided that they were gonna move much faster than normal.
[230:59.69]Yeah, they weren't moving this fast.
[231:03.65]Aren't they bigger?
[231:04.35]I don't think so.
[231:05.43]They seem bigger.
[231:12.03]Jesus, they're everywhere.
[231:14.27]Ah, die, die, die, please, please, please, please, please!
[231:17.34]I haven't said please, fuck!
[231:26.18]Thank God I'm in such a good spot to have to do this.
[231:34.91]Be careful, try to get out of there if you can.
[231:43.85]Hello.
[231:44.49]Hello.
[231:44.91]Hello.
[231:45.21]Hello.
[231:45.35]Yeah, they're really fast.
[231:46.59]Hello.
[231:47.37]Hello.
[231:49.31]Hello.
[231:56.72]I don't like this.
[231:58.18]I don't like this one.
[232:00.98]They become sentient halfway through.
[232:02.90]I don't like it.
[232:03.38]I like when they were just moron meatbags we could just shoot for free.
[232:07.94]Oh, you're taking that guy with you, apparently.
[232:09.56]Yep.
[232:10.14]Take him with you.
[232:16.68]There aren't that many left.
[232:17.84]No, there aren't.
[232:18.74]I'm gonna come get you.
[232:27.53]Actually, no, I'm not.
[232:30.95]They're too close to me.
[232:31.87]Just wait it out.
[232:33.23]Collect some items or something.
[232:41.09]I hate how that fucking does that.
[232:42.71]Even if I switch it.
[232:43.83]And I want it to, like, reload, it still does it.
[232:46.89]I don't like that at all.
[232:50.40]Okay, I'm going to come for you now.
[232:52.68]Actually, let me kill this guy first.
[233:02.13]This dead guy.
[233:03.29]You're in like a weird spot.
[233:04.33]I can't really get you.
[233:05.19]As much as I would like to, I kind of can't.
[233:11.43]I'm surrounded by three guys.
[233:12.83]Yeah, you are.
[233:20.71]Actually, now you're safe.
[233:23.55]At least safe enough for me to come get you.
[233:27.35]So I'm just going to go on an item hunt.
[233:28.70]I hope you're going to have fun just sitting there for like 10... You're going to be sitting there for like 10 minutes while I just frog hop to every item.
[233:40.21]Eventually I'm going to kill this guy over here.
[233:46.04]Alright guys, here comes the best part of the stream where you sit here and watch me collect items.
[233:52.90]There's one left after this guy, right?
[233:55.44]Yeah, okay.
[233:59.93]Alright, now it begins.
[234:11.63]I can get you.
[234:14.98]Hello.
[234:18.69]Thanks.
[234:23.27]I'm gonna go over here.
[234:24.35]There's a lot of shit over here that we missed.
[234:38.89]All the ResidentSleepers.
[234:41.71]Don't you guys want us to get better?
[234:42.77]There's so many opportunities for us to get better.
[234:44.76]Look at all the armor packs.
[234:56.83]We're getting better guys we're getting better and that what matters I'll get they'll wrap around and get those I'm wrapping around I'm getting these how about that sounds like a plan
[235:22.11]Cool.
[235:22.79]I'm kind of sleepy because it's late.
[235:24.57]Yeah, well, it is kind of late.
[235:25.61]See if I can hit you across the whole map.
[235:29.53]No, please don't fuck around right now.
[235:30.97]There's so much at stake.
[235:33.63]You fucking idiot.
[235:35.23]There's too much at stake.
[235:36.47]You can't do that right now.
[235:38.43]You can't fucking do that.
[235:40.43]Don't.
[235:42.81]What are you doing?
[235:44.06]I don't want to do this again.
[235:45.34]You better.
[235:48.62]If you fucking die.
[235:49.86]Don't kill him.
[235:51.58]there's like a hundred more boxes if you don't if you don't get me if you fucking die here I am quitting and I'm done playing I'm fucking out of here if you do not get me or at least get every fucking single no don't kill him you seriously are gonna kill him right now yeah you have like everything no he told this there's like at least like a dozen more boxes
[236:20.15]Are you under his corpse?
[236:21.07]Where are you?
[236:21.77]He's walking past me.
[236:23.13]How far are you?
[236:27.20]You fucking idiot.
[236:29.94]It was a really good shot.
[236:31.52]I don't care how good of a shot it was.
[236:33.68]You can blow smoke up your own ass later.
[236:36.37]Get those items or come get me.
[236:38.25]Either one of those two things has to happen.
[236:43.19]Oh, please don't fucking die to this guy.
[236:50.04]No, just kill him.
[236:50.70]Kill him.
[236:51.32]I'm too scared that something's gonna happen here.
[236:53.29]Just fucking kill him.
[236:54.11]We messed around with like ten red boxes and two green ones.
[236:57.95]It's it.
[237:00.43]You fucking idiot.
[237:03.22]I'm not an idiot.
[237:03.96]An idiot wouldn't hit that shot.
[237:06.52]Get that green box!
[237:09.79]Jerma is actually mad.
[237:11.84]Look at all the stuff we got.
[237:13.28]We had such an opportunity.
[237:15.00]We already got most of the stuff is what you're pointing at.
[237:17.70]Yeah, but there was more stuff.
[237:18.84]We already got it.
[237:20.68]Look at the 40 armor.
[237:21.56]We could have gotten like 60 armor.
[237:26.73]I can't believe you did that.
[237:29.95]Alright, now reverse the rolls.
[237:32.56]If I did that shit to you...
[237:34.88]No.
[237:35.38]If you did that shit, especially because it was on stream, there would have been PogChamps everywhere from how fucking far away that shot was.
[237:45.14]I kind of want to... I'm going to keep that I don't know cannon.
[237:49.89]Keep the I don't know cannon.
[237:51.77]And I'm going to replace Plasma Fall.
[237:56.63]Let's see, what else did I get?
[237:57.55]26.
[237:57.87]Why grenade 20?
[237:59.53]Psy Cluster.
[238:03.44]What the fuck is this?
[238:09.06]Discharges balls of energy which hang silently.
[238:11.38]Oh, this is... Okay, this is weird.
[238:16.59]It's just like a giant cluster bomb.
[238:22.91]What about the other stuff?
[238:27.60]Dynastrike.
[238:28.30]The I Don't Know Cannon.
[238:29.36]Keeping that on.
[238:32.52]Dynastrike 23.
[238:33.08]Let me try Wide Grenade.
[238:44.01]I'm okay with that.
[238:46.25]Yeah, wide like your hips.
[238:48.97]Come on.
[238:53.65]Already plenty of PogChamps.
[239:06.62]I'm ready to go when you are.
[239:09.41]Did you...
[239:14.55]This is why he's here.
[239:15.55]This is why he's on stream.
[239:16.69]This is why I bring him around.
[239:17.79]For him to team kill me in very sensitive situations and to shit his pants on stream.
[239:23.51]Wow, did you hear those potato chip noises?
[239:25.58]Yeah.
[239:26.94]He ruffles loud bags, shits his pants on stream, and team kills me.
[239:31.48]Good thing he's here.
[239:32.12]We should get Etalyx.
[239:35.44]We actually should, because we can have up to four people playing.
[239:38.36]This mission is very long, by the way.
[239:40.71]How do you know that?
[239:42.09]I've played this one.
[239:43.38]How have you played this one this far ahead and didn't know what the other ones were?
[239:45.68]I joined a random lobby.
[239:46.94]Oh.
[239:48.24]To just, like, see what... stuff later in the game was.
[239:51.97]Oh, that's... great.
[239:52.91]Hold on.
[239:53.83]Bobby Tony, let's see what this thing does.
[239:56.71]Wow!
[239:57.37]What the fuck?!
[240:00.03]What?!
[240:01.43]Whoa!
[240:02.97]Okay, that thing is kind- okay.
[240:04.33]That thing's really cool, if I use it correctly next time.
[240:07.94]Ooh!
[240:08.70]I like this helicopter.
[240:16.78]Okay, this helicopter's pretty cool.
[240:20.18]That's a pretty short recharge.
[240:21.36]What happens if I just gun it up there?
[240:23.54]I just want to see what it does.
[240:24.58]This makes like a giant fireworks display.
[240:27.48]It's super slow, though.
[240:30.02]It's like, eventually, it's gonna get you.
[240:32.32]It's gonna land.
[240:34.98]So maybe you just toss that out in front of you?
[240:37.26]Maybe down like a hole or something?
[240:39.80]I don't know.
[240:42.88]Doesn't seem like the most effective.
[240:45.28]It's like a slow motion grenade.
[240:50.13]Oh my god, I've been following this thing waiting for it to open.
[240:53.02]It's already open now, right?
[240:57.96]It's opening inside the, like, barriers, so you can't even shoot it.
[241:01.68]So you have to go destroy the barriers.
[241:02.96]Yeah, you have to run from barrier to barrier, go destroy them, because there aren't even any enemies at them right now.
[241:07.91]But it's going to drop them at each barrier.
[241:09.83]I'm just checking to see what this weapon was doing.
[241:13.23]Seems pretty inefficient.
[241:14.05]Actually, I might even be able to fly my helicopter through these.
[241:16.37]Oh, let me see.
[241:17.01]If I can just toss it, like, straight ahead right here, maybe it'll just, like, instantly kill this thing.
[241:22.91]Eventually.
[241:29.20]Yeah, I don't know about that weapon.
[241:30.94]Seems pretty ineffective.
[241:31.94]I don't think I'm happy with it.
[241:38.46]No, I can't even aim it there either.
[241:41.06]Yeah, fuck that thing.
[241:42.82]Maybe in certain situations, but I don't think right here.
[241:44.91]I'm kind of in a lot of trouble right now because this weapon's not very good.
[241:53.55]Hmm.
[242:07.65]might be okay don't want this thing to reload though until I'm safe I'm coming to you I'm just not safe you're very far away holy you have to destroy inanimate objects that's your your job I I know okay but it's hard to do that when you're one of your only weapons is a slow motion grenade
[242:34.34]Oh yeah, that thing sucks.
[242:36.04]It's really hard to aim.
[242:37.20]Yeah.
[242:38.02]I need... I can't reload this thing until I can stand still.
[242:43.14]Which I have no opportunity to do so.
[242:51.43]Attack gunner.
[242:53.55]Gunner M64.
[242:54.67]Now you're all in big trouble.
[243:01.45]Okay.
[243:02.13]I'm flying up there.
[243:08.29]No, apparently not.
[243:16.42]The grenade gets faster the faster I'm flying?
[243:19.21]Really?
[243:20.69]That's interesting.
[243:32.94]Oh my god, this is so hard to control.
[243:34.42]Alright, okay.
[243:35.46]That's kinda cool.
[243:36.90]So you could really just heave that somewhere.
[243:39.28]Alright.
[243:41.30]Oh, fuck, I'm in trouble.
[243:42.60]Yeah, I'm dead.
[243:46.67]The, uh... For this mission, though, this thing doesn't seem like it's... That should even be in its luck.
[243:51.09]Do you have anything that can destroy the ship up top?
[243:54.85]Uh, I do if I had... Uh... I'm safe over here if you can get me.
[244:01.92]Um...
[244:03.47]One of my other weapons can, but I'll be pretty ineffective doing it now.
[244:14.27]That was the most wishy-washy answer ever.
[244:16.64]Do you have anything that can destroy it?
[244:18.30]I said no, but yes.
[244:20.14]I said I have something.
[244:23.96]I don't care what you have on this character.
[244:25.68]The answer to the question initially was no.
[244:29.21]I answered the question first, and then I said, but I have things I could use if we were to leave.
[244:33.97]But I don't think we need to necessarily leave.
[244:35.93]Forget about the armor for now.
[244:50.39]I just want to see if I can reach it.
[244:51.43]Because when it opens, if I can reach it and shoot the lightning gun in, I might be able to do it.
[244:58.72]Yeah, you'll be able to reach it, especially the higher it gets on the mountain.
[245:01.74]Yeah.
[245:13.40]Yeah, you really need momentum with that thing, too.
[245:15.10]I'm just going to fly around.
[245:19.02]See if I can get up there.
[245:20.83]When it opens.
[245:21.33]I've got a lot of things chasing me, though.
[245:39.39]I wish I had another weapon I could use reliably.
[245:41.25]I'm just not used to using that thing at all.
[245:46.48]It's gonna get me killed!
[245:48.06]I think I did something there.
[246:06.95]Son of a bitch.
[246:13.41]Missiles Alright, is it gonna open yeah, can I yeah I'm too far away with no boost Then I might be able to get there not way too far away It's so hard to get the perfect angle on this with a fucking we need like a helicopter then I
[246:45.56]I mean, a lot... No, you just need to be ready for it.
[246:49.05]Well, it's kind of hard to be ready for it when there's a hundred fucking jumping spiders after you.
[246:53.91]You can... But I have one weapon that I'm using effectively.
[246:58.92]Because I'm trying a new weapon.
[247:05.00]I'm underneath it now.
[247:05.76]We can get rid of these things immediately.
[247:07.54]No, it's gonna fly to the right because it flies to very predictable places and drops them.
[247:10.86]I'm following you right now.
[247:12.14]The right where that, like, field is in between the houses, it's going to drop them next and open right above it.
[247:16.22]I'm right underneath it.
[247:16.88]I'm in a good spot for it now.
[247:18.20]No, you're not.
[247:19.31]You're not.
[247:19.73]No, I'm not.
[247:22.33]I'm hitting it right now.
[247:23.79]Okay.
[247:24.63]Okay.
[247:25.23]And don't tell me I'm not when I am, motherfucker, okay?
[247:29.37]I thought it was going more to the right.
[247:34.11]Eat shit, bug!
[247:37.10]I'm dead.
[247:37.54]No way I'm gonna survive this.
[247:43.24]I lied.
[247:44.62]This is painful.
[247:47.82]Helicopters in this control, like, there's only one axis you can be on at a time, up or down, and it's just... The worst.
[248:01.65]I'm so dead again.
[248:06.28]Give me enough strength!
[248:07.50]Oh, you fucking hero grenade!
[248:11.50]Holy shit, what a hero.
[248:12.54]That grenade was a hero.
[248:14.94]Am I following this thing as far as it's going back here?
[248:18.63]No, it's gone.
[248:20.97]That shit is gone, dude.
[248:22.05]We didn't even destroy it.
[248:35.08]Keep one of these things alive.
[248:38.36]We like we might have just beat it somehow Yeah, we win.
[248:42.66]Okay That honestly, okay, I was talking shit about that grenade the whole time that's why I stayed alive Yeah keyboard to control vehicles the game can't switch between mouse and keyboard to controller I tried to get it to do that
[249:05.93]I killed like four of those red ants in that one second I threw it behind me.
[249:12.69]I wasn't ideal for this mission.
[249:14.43]I wasn't happy using it, but it did end up actually making sure we potentially didn't lose.
[249:19.51]Did you kill it?
[249:22.01]It had me in its mouth killing me.
[249:25.84]How long it would take to run from thing to thing and just do another mission that's faster.
[249:31.74]In its mouth.
[249:38.65]I thought you were in a helicopter.
[249:42.79]How did it get you out of the helicopter?
[249:44.75]Oh, I left the helicopter a while ago.
[249:47.04]Because I did like a... I fucking laser beamed everything from the sky satellite at the end.
[249:53.80]Can you two start a channel where you review nausea medications?
[249:58.64]Yeah.
[250:01.40]Oh, this mission sucks.
[250:03.10]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[250:07.36]What do you mean?
[250:08.09]How so?
[250:09.85]It's very long.
[250:11.09]You have to destroy, like, five support dropper ships.
[250:13.75]There's red ants.
[250:14.63]It's a giant open area.
[250:17.07]I might even preemptively say, let's normal this.
[250:20.02]I think we can beat it, but it'll take a while.
[250:22.12]You want to just normal it?
[250:25.84]I'll normal it if you want.
[250:26.80]But nah, we have terrible weapons, though, for this.
[250:35.79]Hey, thank you, Mask Eptic.
[250:38.11]Mask Eptic.
[250:40.29]Thanks for the sub, dude.
[250:44.97]What do you want to do?
[250:47.76]Let's give it a shot.
[250:49.16]See how fast we can destroy these.
[250:51.78]What would be a good... The laser?
[250:53.22]Tooth laser?
[250:54.66]For this character, what would be a good thing to blow up the ships?
[250:58.88]Medium range lasers are pretty good.
[251:02.20]I mean, the thing I have is amazing, but... I kind of... No, this thing takes too much to fly around.
[251:09.04]Power Stinger... Does she have, like, a missile launcher or something like that?
[251:17.93]I could play Ranger for this.
[251:19.27]Although, I can't really move around that much.
[251:21.53]You know what I want to do, actually?
[251:22.97]What?
[251:23.87]I got a robot that works in the underground areas that's actually a decent level for the first time this whole time we've played it.
[251:31.19]Let's go back into the super cave.
[251:33.13]Back in the cave.
[251:35.29]Alright.
[251:36.11]Let's do a good old super cave.
[251:43.34]Okay.
[251:45.54]I'm definitely not taking off the I don't know.
[251:47.48]Staying on there.
[251:49.76]IDK.
[251:49.88]IDK.
[251:51.43]Is this the new EDF?
[251:52.48]This is the old EDF.
[251:55.20]It's over by one level.
[251:58.04]So we can't do this one.
[252:00.62]This game sucks.
[252:03.62]No.
[252:04.66]We're not doing it?
[252:05.50]Let's just try the other one.
[252:06.62]Why not?
[252:06.96]Let's just do it.
[252:07.70]Oh, I can actually just skip it because I did it and I have the mission directly after.
[252:11.53]I don't want to do it.
[252:12.25]It's just a long... Yeah.
[252:14.47]This one is a whole bunch of spiders.
[252:16.29]You're going to need a long-range weapon.
[252:18.43]Is this level 32?
[252:19.33]It is.
[252:19.75]Alright.
[252:20.05]Let me... Hold on.
[252:22.52]Don't I have something that's 32?
[252:23.72]Okay.
[252:26.22]Let's use our friend the mirror.
[252:28.00]Is this indoors?
[252:30.49]Are we in like a cave?
[252:32.09]Big city.
[252:32.85]Big city.
[252:33.85]The spider webs like snipe you really long range.
[252:38.11]Okay.
[252:39.29]You need some range.
[252:41.07]Then I have that.
[252:42.29]I guess I'll do three-way lance.
[252:49.37]I got my long range and my short range.
[252:50.59]We'll just give this a try.
[252:51.33]I don't think I've even used it.
[252:52.79]I'm ready.
[253:01.30]Hey, did you guys like that last mission?
[253:02.76]It was pretty good.
[253:09.07]Hey, Otto.
[253:09.99]My wife tries to talk to me.
[253:15.76]You don't have that problem because you don't live with anyone, even though you have, like, several bedrooms.
[253:21.47]Uh, by several, you mean two.
[253:24.17]That's a lot.
[253:25.93]You just made it sound like I live in a huge house.
[253:28.65]Oh, yeah, I got, like, so many bedrooms.
[253:30.15]I'd say you have eight bedrooms and four bathrooms.
[253:34.28]Well, that would be incorrect.
[253:38.68]Okay.
[253:42.79]It's getting a good spin.
[253:43.93]Oh, here it comes.
[253:45.07]I've come back, by the way.
[253:48.39]Oh, the jumping spiders?
[253:54.43]Are you dropping the Super D?
[253:58.11]Dropping the Big D?
[254:00.67]Shit, I mistimed that.
[254:01.77]I'm just gonna sit here and fuck it.
[254:06.67]I'm gonna hang on up top.
[254:13.84]There's a guy who wants to come up here?
[254:15.18]Ooh, spiders, huh?
[254:18.92]Where is he?
[254:33.76]Ah, just out of range for that guy.
[254:42.19]Hey, I got it.
[254:44.95]Okay.
[254:47.71]Oh no, don't let them destroy my helicopter before I take off.
[254:51.53]Kind of.
[254:54.90]I'm just gonna sit here for a minute.
[254:57.88]Lance is not great here because it's too short, but, you know, I'm gonna collect some items.
[255:03.18]Oh, there's a spider nest over there.
[255:06.17]Is there?
[255:06.87]Oh shit, there is.
[255:07.49]Okay, I'm gonna get it.
[255:15.66]It's dead.
[255:19.12]Dude, I almost just was a housefly flying into a spider nest.
[255:21.80]That would have been bad.
[255:23.35]I'm going to sit up here for a second.
[255:28.37]Nope, it's not going to work.
[255:30.53]The nest is dead.
[255:31.37]Ah, get off me, you fucker.
[255:41.28]Can I sever this by fucking shooting it?
[255:44.21]You have to destroy the web that it's connected to.
[255:46.25]I'm fucking dead then.
[255:47.13]Yeah, I'm gonna die.
[255:49.29]I'm just getting slowly and slowly.
[255:50.99]I'm caught in like two things.
[255:52.85]I'm dead.
[255:54.87]This item I picked was fucking awful.
[255:57.39]I don't know why I picked it.
[255:59.51]I wanted to see what it was, but I'm dead.
[256:04.85]Oh.
[256:08.62]I have two weapons now.
[256:09.92]The first weapon I have is great.
[256:11.41]The second weapon is one foot in front of my face.
[256:16.31]Don't ask me why I picked it.
[256:17.23]I don't know what that means.
[256:21.69]The second item I have... It's like a lance that shoots like two feet in front of me.
[256:28.08]Hey, thanks.
[256:28.42]Watch out, I can't shoot through that dumb fucking web.
[256:39.09]Biznasty, thanks for the 1500 bits.
[256:41.15]Why does the jetpack woman need holographic pigtails?
[256:43.80]Yeah, I'm wondering that myself.
[256:46.36]I don't know.
[256:49.18]That's a good question.
[256:52.04]She needs that for some reason.
[256:53.92]Can't really give you the answer.
[256:55.36]By the way, we've gone up to like mission 26, 27 now.
[256:58.49]Sure.
[256:58.67]Um...
[257:03.65]How hard was level 10?
[257:06.93]Honestly, yeah.
[257:07.97]It was the hardest mission in the game.
[257:11.84]It was ridiculous.
[257:12.50]It was truly fucking crazy.
[257:22.86]She needs it for aerodynamics.
[257:24.04]I'm just running around collecting shit.
[257:32.37]Oh, I'm overkilling the last guy.
[257:33.85]I think, yeah, we're good.
[257:37.89]We can kill this thing now.
[257:42.64]Aww.
[257:42.94]Yeah, there's, like, one item right here.
[257:47.46]Ah!
[257:48.20]Ah!
[257:50.18]The Fourth of July!
[257:52.32]It was, yeah, it was level 11.
[257:55.72]It wasn't, uh... Ooh, a Jerma rumble!
[257:58.40]Ah, fuck, I just almost broke my screen by pointing at it.
[258:01.66]Ha ha!
[258:03.70]I just, like, fingered into my screen.
[258:05.68]What is it?
[258:06.06]I can't even read it.
[258:06.72]This one's really fun.
[258:08.53]Too much of your dumb text is on the screen.
[258:10.43]Mirage Rumble.
[258:12.57]We gotta see what that is.
[258:15.85]By all means.
[258:17.63]Am I more into pizza or tacos?
[258:18.87]Definitely tacos.
[258:20.69]Tacos are way better, in my personal opinion.
[258:23.07]How could you hate a taco?
[258:24.55]Alright, what is it called?
[258:26.65]The Jerma Rumble?
[258:28.72]Special attack, homing, what is it under?
[258:30.22]Homing weapons, Mirage Rumble.
[258:33.98]The specifically improved version of the Mirage mind-guided weapon.
[258:38.86]It has greatly improved destructive power and homing capabilities.
[258:41.36]However, its output can be difficult to control.
[258:43.47]It's unstable.
[258:46.15]The direction of each discharge changes.
[258:49.11]There's more and more risk of hitting the ground and injuring yourself.
[258:52.65]Yeah.
[258:52.83]I highly recommend it.
[258:53.75]I know.
[258:53.99]It's amazing.
[258:56.28]Wouldn't recommend it for this mission either.
[258:57.98]No?
[258:58.78]Because that's the mission I got that item on, and then I used it on this one, and I felt useless.
[259:02.79]Huh.
[259:03.49]There's just gigantic huge swarms of red ants.
[259:07.37]Just huge swarms?
[259:09.05]Yeah.
[259:09.61]Okay.
[259:10.01]Well, in that case, I'm going to use the... But that Mirage Rumble is really good against anything in the air.
[259:15.18]Right.
[259:17.64]Um... I'll just take the Plasma Fall.
[259:20.64]I like that.
[259:20.98]I mean, being able to... No, no, no, no, no.
[259:22.70]Where is the big Super D2 launcher?
[259:24.67]There.
[259:26.17]Or, yeah, this is the big puffy one.
[259:31.05]This is the big puffy one.
[259:34.98]Oh my god, wait, I had the wrong... What was that?
[259:38.68]What was that, Star?
[259:39.96]Dude, what happened?
[259:41.92]You picked the wrong loadout?
[259:43.96]Oh, don't trick me like that.
[259:45.48]Holy shit.
[259:51.91]There are so many of them.
[259:53.63]Oh, check this out.
[259:55.23]Come on, you gotta do something here.
[259:56.41]Something cool.
[259:56.99]I'm doing it.
[259:57.45]It's gonna take some time.
[260:06.10]Oh, boy!
[260:11.77]Okay, that's fucking awesome.
[260:15.73]Holy shit.
[260:17.85]Wow.
[260:20.19]Okay, well.
[260:22.57]Let's just both be those characters for this.
[260:24.27]Alright, you ever play the game Beach Head 2000?
[260:37.88]Yeah.
[260:38.00]That's what we're playing right now.
[260:43.10]But with bugs.
[260:45.67]Bug Head 2000?
[260:46.07]Bug Head 2000.
[260:46.61]Wait, what?
[261:04.12]EDF, come on, man.
[261:10.92]There's one getting behind us.
[261:18.51]Oh, I hit the guy in the corpse in front of him.
[261:22.01]Aww.
[261:23.11]Does it save me to go out and get stuff?
[261:26.23]Yeah, they come over the far hill next with a whole nother way.
[261:29.35]I'm just trying to see where the green boxes are to right here So do we move just to the other side?
[261:35.98]No, we could stay where we were they come over like Opposite of the oh, no, they're come.
[261:40.36]Whoa.
[261:40.88]Oh god.
[261:41.34]No, that's what I'm saying.
[261:42.48]Like they're all kind of wrong We got to go like the other side of the beach
[261:51.03]I remembered it wrong.
[261:52.83]I remembered the third base.
[261:53.61]Oh, you're so dead.
[261:55.69]Bye, Star.
[261:56.29]It was nice knowing you.
[262:01.83]Ah, good luck.
[262:03.09]I just shot it.
[262:04.05]I just shot it and didn't hit anything.
[262:08.25]The wave of these people is so loud.
[262:11.09]It is like a rushing train.
[262:14.94]Oh, no.
[262:15.16]That might be your bullets.
[262:16.28]I think it was your bullets.
[262:17.18]Yeah.
[262:17.36]Yeah.
[262:19.08]Are you alright?
[262:19.64]Do you need me to come over and, like, help you there?
[262:22.78]I gotta get back to my mech.
[262:29.06]I don't think I can do that.
[262:29.94]Oh, god.
[262:31.30]That was so fucking satisfying.
[262:32.72]Ooh, boink.
[262:43.66]This thing's kind of hard to aim if you're not above everybody, just because it's so big that you don't want it to hit the ground, but you can't... See what I'm doing?
[262:50.00]I'm, like, aiming too high.
[262:50.93]But if I aim too low, it, like, hits the ground.
[262:55.15]I need to, like, fly in the air to use this effectively, really.
[262:58.13]Yeah.
[263:00.07]Okay, this is going to be inherently better.
[263:01.83]Inherently better.
[263:02.41]I like that word.
[263:06.06]No, I got it.
[263:10.62]You might die.
[263:11.96]Oh, no, I moved it.
[263:19.13]Also, this beach is littered with armor.
[263:21.19]Yeah, I know.
[263:21.66]I'm just gonna get it.
[263:24.42]I'll get it.
[263:24.74]I can call another one of those in.
[263:26.78]Is there one more after this?
[263:28.78]Yeah, that's where they come over the distant mountains.
[263:37.91]Yeah, if you talk about a thing to farm and to just get armor, man, there's so many of these.
[263:41.29]Holy shit.
[263:43.57]It's too many for me to even get.
[263:53.12]Alright, now they come over.
[263:54.36]Which hill?
[263:56.34]This one back here.
[263:57.18]Oh, look at that.
[263:57.82]That's so cool looking.
[264:03.29]That is so awesome.
[264:09.25]You really feel like you're part of a massive scale ant war.
[264:11.97]Yeah, this is the best mission I've played.
[264:14.95]That's so cool.
[264:15.89]I love seeing that.
[264:17.82]oh come on boom boom get it oh yes I can't get it right now I'll get it in a minute I'll get it in a minute
[264:49.20]So yeah, this is definitely your favorite mission because you can just fucking rain hell.
[264:54.06]Well, last time I played it, I was your class.
[264:58.50]Just cool to see them all come over the mountain.
[265:01.44]It is.
[265:11.53]Is this the last phase?
[265:13.00]Yeah.
[265:13.61]So you start picking shit up.
[265:15.47]And I'm calling in one more big boy.
[265:16.75]Because I just keep getting these.
[265:18.77]Because every time I call in and it kills enough that I get another.
[265:22.71]This is the artillery guide mission, for sure.
[265:27.58]I'm not even going to fight anything else.
[265:28.68]I'm just going to collect items the rest of the time we're here.
[265:33.08]So many green boxes.
[265:41.48]So many.
[265:42.26]Oh, I love it.
[265:50.89]Is that it for the greens?
[265:53.61]There's one more in the middle.
[266:00.13]He's doing another one.
[266:05.92]He's still alive.
[266:07.40]Are you kidding me?
[266:15.01]Yeah Can't really get it out in the middle is like three Oh shit, you just did another one did you know let's get me like that My Mac shoots him up in here and does something's pretty similar.
[266:36.65]I might have accidentally killed him.
[266:40.70]Oh That one last one has no health
[266:42.75]No, it's alright.
[266:43.19]I got most of the greens anyways.
[266:45.25]Yeah, I got like... I think I got all the greens.
[266:47.88]I see one right near you that you didn't get.
[266:49.42]Where is it?
[266:52.06]Got all the greens, huh?
[266:54.68]I saw that.
[266:55.66]Fuck you!
[266:56.74]Fuck you!
[266:58.28]Fuck you!
[266:59.75]Laser 201, Pandora B, and a move called Heaven's Gate.
[267:05.05]Pandora B is the thing that spits things everywhere.
[267:08.55]They throw out into the air.
[267:09.57]What the hell is Heaven's Gate?
[267:12.13]That's in anime.
[267:15.78]Heaven's Gate.
[267:17.22]A top secret super weapon.
[267:19.28]Its very existence is highly classified.
[267:22.03]It's anyone's guess how exactly it works.
[267:24.57]discharges balls of energy which hang silently in the air and extends pillars of light downward toward the ground.
[267:30.21]All who touch these pillars will be devastated.
[267:33.42]Um... Yeah, yeah.
[267:34.62]This is a good mission.
[267:38.86]Let's give it a try.
[267:40.88]Let's try this highly classified item.
[267:44.20]Um, I would recommend... What?
[267:47.50]Recommend what?
[267:49.45]Hey, thank you, FableEvil.
[267:50.90]Thank you, FableEvil.
[267:52.56]FableEvil8 for the sub.
[267:54.48]Phelpsie97 for 10 months.
[267:56.24]Thanks for 10 months in a row.
[267:58.44]Much love, dude.
[267:59.16]BizNasty with the 1500 bits, even though I said it already.
[268:02.20]Thanks again.
[268:02.74]I want to make that very fucking clear.
[268:04.24]You know what I'm saying?
[268:14.79]Heaven's Gate is a shitty weapon, is it?
[268:16.79]No?
[268:17.09]Well, let's see what it is.
[268:21.23]What's the deal with this one?
[268:27.01]I don't want to tell you.
[268:28.55]You don't want to give your teammate the proper intel?
[268:31.33]I don't want to warn you, but you should have picked weapons that you're very comfortable with.
[268:36.30]Okay, well, that would be Heaven's Gate.
[268:44.18]Oh, boy.
[268:44.58]Yeah.
[268:45.68]Alright, let's Heaven's Gate.
[268:47.84]I don't know what it does, but let's use it.
[269:00.34]Heaven's Gate.
[269:02.45]Heaven's Gate.
[269:04.55]Look at Heaven's Gate over there.
[269:06.75]Take a look at that.
[269:07.35]Heaven's Gate.
[269:08.77]It hasn't killed one enemy.
[269:10.35]Well, it got one bug.
[269:12.07]Heaven's Gate.
[269:13.35]It's top secret super weapon.
[269:16.70]Don't tell anyone about it.
[269:17.62]Yeah, don't tell anyone we just used it.
[269:21.58]Fucking super weapon.
[269:22.54]Okay, we can restart.
[269:27.55]Yeah.
[269:27.71]Yeah, you're really going to need some, like, good weapons on this one.
[269:30.23]Yeah, nice peewee Harmingate.
[269:33.35]Why does it suck that bad?
[269:35.07]Am I, like, missing something?
[269:38.31]Downwards, it's still possible to control the height and trajectory?
[269:41.27]I don't know.
[269:44.21]Let's just go with the tried and true.
[269:47.63]Tried and true.
[269:49.07]I wish I could get that.
[270:06.52]Most of the super weapons suck.
[270:08.70]Yeah, that's kind of what the impression I got from them.
[270:11.52]Yeah.
[270:13.32]Holding a checkpoint.
[270:13.98]Yeah, actually, like in one of those cave levels, maybe you could just throw it down.
[270:16.30]It would just constantly murder people.
[270:24.43]Waiting on you.
[270:29.55]after this mission uh win or lose I think I'm gonna get out of here okay that works out perfectly that works out perfectly one o'clock in the morning and this is technically an off schedule oh my god today's Saturday today is well not not anymore perfect perfect it's Sunday table tennis Sunday 7 00 a.m well you got to be up early then I ain't going to bed
[271:00.05]You're not going to bed.
[271:01.49]You need to recharge, man, and get like a breakfast of Wheaties before you go do table tennis.
[271:04.81]Are you crazy?
[271:06.71]The only way I'd ever make it is if I stayed up all night.
[271:11.09]No, that's not true.
[271:11.75]One o'clock... What?
[271:12.83]If you go to bed at like two, that's like five hours of sleep, man.
[271:16.45]I can't.
[271:16.85]I've been going to bed at 5 a.m.
[271:19.21]Well, I think I found your problem.
[271:22.39]I know my problem already.
[271:23.87]I don't need you.
[271:24.75]Do we have to destroy these like the other ones?
[271:26.95]Yeah.
[271:27.43]Oh, boy.
[271:27.86]This mission's going to be fucking hell.
[271:31.40]Well, as the late, great Homer Simpson once said.
[271:34.76]I think we have help with them being destroyed.
[271:36.33]As you can see, some of them are already blowing up, but there are a couple we're going to have to destroy.
[271:41.43]Like the late, great Homer Simpson once said.
[271:43.91]Don't!
[271:47.35]He's waiting for one to open.
[271:48.37]I'm not sure which one opens.
[271:49.49]They're hurting themselves.
[271:53.73]Holy shit, man.
[271:55.29]Alright, well.
[272:01.29]Is this one on the left open?
[272:02.64]I think it does, yeah.
[272:07.62]Hello?
[272:10.04]Hello?
[272:10.60]I think once we kill some of the ants it starts to open.
[272:18.75]Tell me when it starts opening because I can't see it.
[272:21.47]I would love to.
[272:28.30]Uh, it's... nope.
[272:29.82]Well, there's one crashing down here now.
[272:31.20]So, just looking at this dumb thing, I'm not even paying attention to the ants.
[272:41.66]Nope, still closed.
[272:45.77]Oh my god.
[272:46.67]I have two ants killing me that I can't turn... I'm dead.
[272:50.51]Okay.
[272:51.29]Help me.
[272:52.81]Help is on the way, dear!
[272:57.54]What is your mech doing?
[273:00.28]Your mech is just flying by itself.
[273:07.93]Still closed.
[273:11.27]Still closed.
[273:28.50]Ah, don't think these open for a while.
[273:33.62]If I were to take a guess.
[273:36.14]Are you good?
[273:36.58]Where are you at?
[273:38.58]Oh, I'm so good, and that one's open.
[273:41.48]Which one's open?
[273:42.46]Oh, God, of course.
[273:43.20]Of course it's the one we're not babysitting.
[273:47.89]Well, let's go.
[273:48.51]Okay.
[274:00.30]We are outnumbered, you're right about that.
[274:07.31]Why man?
[274:07.69]Get in the air.
[274:09.07]It's open.
[274:13.89]I think I'm not in a good spot to shoot it.
[274:26.49]On the next one I gotta sit here and charge up I can't go in Hey, let me guess the one on the opposite side is gonna open up we have to destroy this one first Lots of items
[274:59.37]Oh, you want health.
[275:00.27]There's like a shitload of health now.
[275:02.15]I am fine.
[275:03.43]I'm in a giant mech.
[275:06.73]Technically, you're in a mech, but... Your actual health, I mean.
[275:16.00]Don't mind me.
[275:16.76]Oh, in real life?
[275:17.58]Like, I've been doing pretty good.
[275:19.64]How's your health?
[275:24.92]I'm not doing so good.
[275:34.67]Who?
[275:35.29]Who?
[275:36.61]Who?
[275:40.71]I don't know who.
[275:42.87]But, I guess.
[275:44.45]Okay.
[275:45.56]That was a thing.
[275:46.14]Alright, I'm gonna get under there.
[275:51.02]Oh, I'm going for it.
[275:53.36]What was a thing?
[275:54.08]What are you talking about?
[275:54.80]Nothing.
[275:55.04]Just forget I said anything.
[276:04.46]Who?
[276:05.30]Who?
[276:06.40]Who?
[276:06.76]I'm dead.
[276:10.00]It wasn't me.
[276:10.44]Yeah, it actually might have been.
[276:16.92]That actually might have been you.
[276:19.96]Oh god, I need you alive.
[276:21.69]Well, you're gonna have to come get me.
[276:23.11]There's only like three ants over here.
[276:24.53]No, Jerma.
[276:25.47]What do you mean no?
[276:26.49]This is a bad time to be dead.
[276:31.00]Like right here, right now, there's like three ants.
[276:36.88]Come and get me.
[276:38.86]There's like two fucking ants.
[276:40.94]I think we're done with this mission.
[276:43.86]There's another dinosaur!
[276:45.06]What is that thing?
[276:50.68]It's a little mini... It's looking like a special express!
[276:56.37]Oh my god!
[276:59.37]I got ya!
[277:00.31]I got ya!
[277:02.01]I got ya, holy shit!
[277:04.01]Why the... What is this game, seriously?
[277:08.25]Bugs, robots, and like, Godzilla's dragons.
[277:12.72]Does anything in this fucking game make any sense?
[277:16.82]I want the health, but... Alright, I'm... Should we retreat back to here?
[277:20.62]No, you just fly... He won't hit you, really.
[277:22.78]It's very hard for him to hit Flygro.
[277:24.28]Okay.
[277:31.56]I want to be full.
[277:41.62]I just want to watch him.
[277:47.37]He's just playing in the mud.
[277:48.51]He's just having fun.
[277:51.27]Oh, he's looking at me.
[277:52.03]I don't like him looking at me like this.
[277:56.19]Wow.
[277:59.48]Oh dear, I ran out of juice.
[278:03.10]I'm fine.
[278:03.72]No, I'm not.
[278:04.56]Don't come this way.
[278:06.08]How much health do we have?
[278:17.43]Some say, more than one.
[278:21.01]What is that creature?
[278:24.15]We haven't got much yet.
[278:25.73]There's no other species like it in the record books.
[278:29.62]I love how he's kind of just a moron.
[278:31.02]Yeah, he is.
[278:34.62]Is there like a weak point you have to hit him on, or no?
[278:36.28]Just hit him.
[278:37.62]Him.
[278:38.30]Just hit him, the giant monster man.
[278:42.21]Oh, he might come crawl at me.
[278:44.63]Well, I... Nope, he's just going to do the back step twice.
[278:54.84]No, he's still alive.
[278:56.36]Whoa!
[278:59.74]Okay, I'm out of ammo in my mech, and because we're not actually killing things, I can't get another one.
[279:10.23]This is too much, man.
[279:12.79]I'm like, I gotta like stand still to get my recharge.
[279:17.05]Don't bleed, don't bleed that at me.
[279:24.48]This is fucking crazy.
[279:26.16]I love this game.
[279:29.20]It's like, don't... I messed it all up.
[279:34.28]It's okay.
[279:34.58]Alright, I'm going in.
[279:49.23]Come on, you big sack of shit.
[279:53.15]How could anything possibly stand up to this much firepower?
[279:57.36]I kind of can't do anything right now on my two.
[279:59.80]No, I don't want to get that close.
[280:02.68]I'm... I'm all out of my big guns.
[280:10.87]Please?
[280:14.93]Maybe you gotta shoot him, like, in the anus.
[280:17.59]Anus shot, anus shot.
[280:18.83]Funny streamer.
[280:20.83]I wasn't trying to be funny.
[280:21.65]I'm being real.
[280:22.32]It looks like it's not protecting.
[280:23.12]I'm saying it was funny.
[280:23.96]I laughed.
[280:24.44]It was funny.
[280:25.22]I'm saying I laughed.
[280:28.38]I think he's gonna do a lightning bolt.
[280:30.94]No, he's just taunting.
[280:35.46]He's just taunting.
[280:44.95]It's working!
[280:45.47]Come on, EDF!
[280:46.55]EDF!
[280:48.77]EDF!
[280:51.58]God damn, man!
[280:53.50]How much health does he have?
[281:02.63]He just leaves yeah, he just plays in the mud for a bit and goes home Okay, that was fucking cool we did it that was really cool
[281:30.51]I was looking away for a second, and then I just kind of got scared.
[281:33.55]Jerma has been knocked up.
[281:36.99]Plasma launcher, cool.
[281:38.69]Level 25.
[281:41.39]Well, that was a good one to go out on.
[281:43.05]Yep.
[281:43.58]The next one is awful.
[281:45.20]The next one is truly awful.
[281:47.96]Alright, well, Star, say your goodnights and your goodbyes.
[281:50.70]Hey, everyone.
[281:51.90]Thanks for coming by the Jerma stream.
[281:53.92]I hope you guys stay tuned to the Jerma stream.
[281:57.41]Alright, cool.
[281:57.75]Because he's going to stream every day.
[282:01.88]Well, that ain't true.
[282:03.72]He's muted now.
[282:06.30]He's muted, so you can't hear.
[282:07.92]It's alright.
[282:08.76]I don't want him to say any more false information.
[282:12.75]And I'm going to move out of here.
[282:14.15]Star, thank you for playing.
[282:15.09]Star, if I can still hear you.
[282:18.59]And I'm moving up.
[282:20.36]Alright, thanks a lot, guys.
[282:22.56]That was fun.
[282:23.28]This game is really fun.
[282:24.34]Last night, I feel like we made a lot of progress since last night.
[282:28.02]Figuring out how to actually play this video game rather than just jump into hard and be idiots and not understand that you need to actually have armor and get weapons and, you know.
[282:37.06]But, before I go, thanks to Ninjatsune for three months.
[282:43.95]Much appreciated, dude.
[282:47.63]And then, yeah, thanks for the bits.
[282:49.99]Thanks for the subs.
[282:51.03]Thanks for sticking around.
[282:51.77]This was an off-schedule stream.
[282:54.13]Hope you guys enjoyed it.
[282:55.73]I'll see you guys.
[282:56.85]I'm probably not going to stream for the rest of the weekend.
[282:59.40]I'm going to be live on my regularly scheduled program, which is Tuesday.
[283:05.06]So Tuesday, 7 o'clock, it's time to do The Last Guardian.
[283:11.18]And depending on how much fun that game is, we'll do potentially Last Guardian on Thursday and maybe even Friday.
[283:19.28]Or if The Last Guardian is either easily completable or I kind of want to change your pace, we'll play Dead Rising 4.
[283:26.49]Tuesday.
[283:27.03]See ya.
[283:28.75]Much love, guys.
[283:29.69]Have a good rest of your night.
[283:30.95]Have a good sleep because it's probably really late where everybody is right now.
[283:35.35]So good night, guys.
[283:36.83]Good luck and goodbye.
