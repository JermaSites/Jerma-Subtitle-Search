[04:16.31]I did.
[04:16.59]Uh-oh.
[04:18.11]It's duel time.
[04:18.89]I don't know who I room for here.
[04:25.10]I'm just going to knock your teeth out.
[04:29.77]Okay, I'm going to get this guy.
[04:31.99]Are you on this?
[04:45.60]You're as tall as him now.
[04:48.02]No, are you serious?
[04:49.22]I'm as tall as him now when he's kneeling.
[04:50.92]No, you're a little taller.
[04:52.64]No, go back to him now when he's standing up kneeling.
[04:56.86]Alright, Alex, you apparently have to see this.
[05:04.77]Mini-me, playable character in Borderlands 2.
[05:08.90]I love how this guy has an accent, like a British accent.
[05:11.50]I'm spouting exposition again, aren't I?
[05:16.16]Reminds me of the guy from the Wild Thornberrys.
[05:18.00]Yes, he does.
[05:18.76]Yes, Nigel, yes.
[05:19.40]Yeah, Nigel Thornberry.
[05:25.56]Oh, Eliza.
[05:26.32]Ravishing.
[05:26.68]Oh, yeah.
[05:27.46]Oh, here they are.
[05:28.12]Oh, wow.
[05:28.78]Wait for me.
[05:30.56]Oh, yeah.
[05:31.26]Crazy fallen shooting skills.
[05:46.23]Oh, there's so much recoil.
[05:49.75]Oh, there's more.
[05:50.43]They're coming out of that cave now.
[05:53.10]I can't see anything.
[05:54.44]I'm getting dizzy.
[05:58.08]There we go.
[06:01.44]Get cleared, Pond.
[06:02.72]Clear the graveyard.
[06:04.16]Thanks a lot, Nigel.
[06:05.20]Thank you, Nigel.
[06:05.82]Thanks, Nigel.
[06:13.03]What do we got here?
[06:15.11]I want the things.
[06:16.77]I think I'm too small to jump up on this cliff.
[06:20.31]Do we have to go up there?
[06:21.91]I really, yeah, I am.
[06:23.71]I can't get up here, guys.
[06:27.52]I really can't.
[06:28.62]Come on, Jared.
[06:29.98]Hang on, hang on.
[06:30.46]Let me give you a boost.
[06:31.48]Oh my gosh.
