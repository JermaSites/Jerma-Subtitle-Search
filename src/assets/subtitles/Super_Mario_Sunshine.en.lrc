[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.38]Hey.
[00:03.58]What's going on?
[00:06.52]How's it going?
[00:08.67]I am holding back some excitement here.
[00:14.47]I am so excited.
[00:17.73]Because today, I'm going to be playing Super Mario Sunshine for the first time in my whole life.
[00:27.42]I turned 37 this year.
[00:29.08]I have never pressed jump once.
[00:32.14]We're gonna do it together.
[00:33.02]On Super Mario Sunshine.
[00:38.40]Can't wait.
[00:38.82]I'll be right back.
[00:42.17]See ya.
[01:51.14]Okay.
[01:52.84]Are you guys ready?
[01:55.58]Are you ready?
[01:56.12]Should we watch the opening cutscene?
[01:58.29]This is back in 2002.
[02:02.55]The opening cutscene just kind of plays before you press start.
[02:06.59]And it replays sometimes randomly.
[02:08.37]That's how opening cutscenes work.
[02:12.15]Take as much time as possible.
[02:14.44]Take as much time as possible.
[02:21.19]You really want me to do that?
[02:25.45]Wait, the cutscene is five minutes long?
[02:30.32]What has there ever been a five minute Mario cutscene?
[02:32.54]What is this, Kojima?
[02:33.30]Come on.
[02:34.76]I don't got time for that.
[02:35.62]I wanna... I don't wanna do any of that other shit.
[02:40.00]Alright, well this is not the cutscene.
[02:44.23]How do I get the cutscene to play?
[02:45.19]Are you ready?
[02:51.26]Here it is!
[02:51.62]I have to adjust the screen a little bit, but here it is.
[02:55.40]Are these spoilers?
[02:58.70]These are spoilers!
[03:00.78]I'm not going to look at the screen.
[03:04.20]I'm not looking at the screen.
[03:05.72]I'm just fixing the aspect ratio.
[03:07.96]That's all I'm doing.
[03:13.82]There could be something on the screen right now, I don't know what it is, but I want a lyre.
[03:17.56]I can obviously see the screen, because...
[03:20.52]Because I'm moving it.
[03:22.50]I'm moving with my hand.
[03:25.79]Guys, don't worry.
[03:26.39]I can't see the screen.
[03:31.65]We wait for the cutscene?
[03:35.09]Hold on.
[03:36.85]You gotta get it perfect.
[03:39.29]This is the most classic fucking GameCube video game ever.
[03:41.79]You think I'm gonna have like a fucked up aspect ratio?
[03:44.39]Nope.
[03:47.21]Alright, should I press start?
[03:48.69]Or should I wait for the cutscene to play?
[03:55.67]Start.
[03:59.23]Do you want to create a file for this game on the memory card in slot A?
[04:02.11]Yes.
[04:02.62]This actually looks pretty good.
[04:09.80]I've never played this.
[04:11.54]It's actually kind of insane.
[04:13.04]I've never played this game.
[04:15.33]Alright, A, B. Let's go with B. Start.
[04:19.15]Start.
[04:23.58]Oh, here, we got the opening cutscene.
[04:25.06]Alright, shh, quiet.
[04:29.58]Our subtitle, subtitle, our subtitle's on.
[04:31.26]Don't worry, it's gonna be four different words.
[04:33.25]It's oh and whoa.
[04:43.53]Mm-hmm.
[04:52.31]Please explain.
[04:54.29]What the fuck?
[04:55.25]Oh shit!
[04:55.75]They don't just talk in one word like- Ooh!
[04:58.51]They used to do that.
[04:59.52]Is that Mario talking?
[05:00.20]Is that the-
[05:20.01]I am most concerned with the well-being of the princess in this dreadful heat.
[05:24.47]Master Mario, if you would, cross over to that shore and find some assistance.
[05:33.87]Yes.
[05:34.55]Mario, be careful.
[05:35.55]I have a bad feeling about this.
[05:39.97]Holy shit.
[05:40.97]It's so fucking fluid.
[05:43.57]Holy shit, it's so fluid.
[05:50.99]How do I get out of the water?
[05:57.30]You have to do... This is the most fluid game I've ever played in my life.
[06:02.90]Alright, let's go.
[06:09.43]He's struggling already?
[06:12.47]They all talk?
[06:16.13]It looks like this gunk is coming from somewhere below.
[06:19.13]It's really slippery, so watch your step.
[06:20.79]You know when you haven't done something in your whole life, and you've anticipated this moment your entire life, and now that you're doing it, you're like, fuck, I don't, like, the anticipation is like, I don't want to do this.
[06:32.70]I want to constantly never have played this game.
[06:34.50]Alright, let's go.
[06:37.10]What about you?
[06:38.72]What are you waiting for?
[06:42.26]Do something!
[06:42.90]This gooey paint of yours completely covered by friend.
[06:50.86]Come on, I can't.
[06:51.55]This is paint.
[06:55.47]What's going on up here?
[06:59.71]Help, help.
[07:00.17]Are you crazy?
[07:00.89]We're the ones who need help.
[07:02.55]Take that water pump and clean the airstrip.
[07:04.76]You.
[07:05.56]You.
[07:15.90]Where's the pump?
[07:21.87]Am I, like, insane?
[07:26.52]Step on it?
[07:27.12]I mean, the pump is right there.
[07:30.42]Do I have to, like, turn it?
[07:32.50]Use the pump?
[07:33.56]Can I just use it?
[07:41.74]Where's my thing?
[07:51.03]The flood is right there.
[07:52.11]I thought this was a person.
[07:54.57]Okay, I thought that was a person.
[07:56.39]I thought this was a person.
[07:58.09]I've never seen this thing, but it looks like.
[08:00.60]I thought this was a duck.
[08:02.80]I thought I'd never seen this thing up close before.
[08:05.23]This thing talks.
[08:06.57]I thought it was a fucking backpack in Smash Bros.
[08:08.27]I didn't know what this was.
[08:08.93]It is the backpack from Smash.
[08:10.86]Yeah, but I never see it up close.
[08:11.94]I just... I get annoyed by it.
[08:35.75]I've never seen this up close.
[08:51.74]Press the X button to switch to the hover nozzle.
[08:55.19]You can then press the R button to hover in the air for a short time.
[09:02.97]If this tank is empty, no water can be sprayed.
[09:08.14]To refill tank, enter a body of water and press the R button.
[09:14.30]The instructions complete.
[09:19.33]Proceed.
[09:26.96]Mario!
[09:27.20]Alright, we need water.
[09:31.56]Got it.
[09:39.28]This is the most fun game I've ever played in my whole life.
[09:50.27]I have to clean everything.
[09:52.27]I'm gonna clean every single thing.
[10:08.58]I can't play this game.
[10:09.22]I have to leave.
[10:10.73]No, I can't.
[10:11.29]This is Luigi's Mansion 3 all over again.
[10:13.73]It's not going to... I'm not going to... It's never going to stop, guys.
[10:15.83]I'm never going to be able to do this.
[10:19.11]Ah, there we go.
[10:19.85]Alright.
[10:20.91]I can't do it.
[10:21.39]I don't think I should play this.
[10:32.93]Cry in the face.
[10:39.94]This is so cool.
[10:40.84]Did this win any Academy Awards or anything?
[10:44.00]Did it?
[10:44.22]Did it win, like, Game of the, like, Oscar of the Year?
[10:53.66]Sorry, I'm talking kind of loud because I have both headphones in for the first time in, like, three years.
[10:58.91]I'm talking like there's a vacuum cleaner running, and I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
[11:19.45]Ooh, and Mario B. Where's the, um... The only song I know?
[11:26.24]I don't think that's him.
[11:36.42]I don't like how that thing talks.
[11:41.45]I mean, that Kazooie motherfucker, they knew what they were doing with Kazooie.
[11:45.51]This is Banjo-Kazooie, but Mario.
[11:49.89]Why am I arrested?
[11:52.55]Court is now in session.
[11:55.41]As you are no doubt aware, someone has been senselessly defacing fair Isle Delfino using some paint-like substance.
[12:03.44]The accused is charged with ruining our beautiful home, and yes, endangering our very way of life.
[12:10.79]Indeed, how can one not be aware of what is going on?
[12:15.14]Though it is daytime in Delfino Plaza, our poor residents tremble beneath a veil of darkness.
[12:21.72]Expert shine scholars have determined that this darkness has arisen because all of our guardians, the shine sprites, have vanished from their gathering spot at the shine gate.
[12:34.13]The reason?
[12:35.45]It's quite obvious.
[12:37.39]This horrible graffiti is to blame.
[12:41.19]Behold the sketch of the perpetrator based on eyewitness descriptions.
[12:46.11]The truth is obvious.
[12:47.75]The guilty party sits among us.
[12:50.13]It is none other than Mario.
[12:52.51]Is that my lawyer?
[12:55.23]Wait, Peach is my lawyer?
[12:56.53]This feels fan-made.
[12:58.07]Is this what the real story is?
[13:14.57]This appears to be quite a predicament, Mario.
[13:17.91]Data analysis verifies that the island's inhabitants are indeed troubled by pollution, but the pollution itself is not the main problem.
[13:28.60]Mario, you witnessed this object at the airstrip, correct?
[13:32.88]Mario sentenced to life.
[13:34.12]Big bits came in from phylactery.
[13:57.11]The only way to ensure the return of the Sharn sprites is to keep the island from becoming any dirtier.
[14:05.68]The perpetrator is likely at work even as we speak.
[14:10.62]And you, Mario, are being treated as a criminal.
[14:15.03]Tomorrow we must do our best to resolve this situation.
[14:18.09]Break out.
[14:18.51]Can we break out of prison?
[14:20.33]Is there a prison break?
[14:24.57]Mission?
[14:25.72]In Mario Sunshine?
[14:29.72]Holy shit.
[14:32.40]Oh, but Phylactery Lich gave $50.
[14:34.62]5,000 bits.
[14:35.40]Hey, Jerma, glad to see you playing another cleaning game.
[14:37.77]Anybody in chat that likes to... Anybody in chat?
[14:41.05]I think there's a few people in chat.
[14:44.92]Thanks for the- This way, that way.
[14:47.16]Thanks for the five fucking thousand bits, dude.
[14:49.14]That's a lot of money.
[14:50.62]Thanks a lot, dude.
[14:51.78]Again.
[14:51.96]Dude, every stream.
[14:53.14]So much money.
[14:54.74]Oh, this is it!
[14:55.84]Yeah!
[15:25.20]Holy shit.
[15:25.70]Okay, where am I going?
[15:26.62]Clean up the town.
[15:28.82]Buy, uh, salsa.
[15:31.26]Or whatever this is.
[15:32.68]Pepper.
[15:33.08]Salsa pepper.
[15:33.84]Hot pepper.
[15:35.50]Strawberry.
[15:36.97]Throw it.
[15:38.07]I'm overwhelmed.
[15:38.65]Alright, what am I doing?
[15:43.51]For you.
[15:46.39]Well, well, well, if it isn't you.
[15:47.63]You have that tourist map.
[15:49.07]Did I tell you to press the Z button to view that thing?
[15:55.29]This is Delfino Plaza.
[15:57.25]Delfino Airstrip.
[16:01.66]This is so cute.
[16:02.86]Click!
[16:04.60]Delfino Plaza, Delfino Airstrip, one.
[16:07.08]Total one.
[16:10.09]Okay.
[16:10.21]Can I go and zoom in?
[16:12.37]Alright.
[16:12.99]Is that- Wait, is that- Am I- Okay, I might be losing my mind.
[16:14.81]Pianta, okay.
[16:15.13]Alright, let's go.
[16:16.15]I got full water.
[16:16.99]What about Toad?
[16:18.35]Toad have anything to say?
[16:40.19]Everyone on this isle loves to do the Box Breaker.
[16:43.01]Just jump up and press L to smash.
[16:45.59]Why don't you give it a try?
[16:54.36]Mario.
[16:55.27]Vario.
[16:56.35]I like the way that Flood says that.
[16:58.37]Mario.
[17:17.02]RUIN IT!
[17:17.56]Alright, what am I doing?
[17:18.52]Cleaning.
[17:22.33]Well, I'm pleased to see you're safe, I must tell you.
[17:24.49]We were walking around town earlier, and it seems the area near the Shine Gate is still quite bright.
[17:29.89]Perhaps you should check it out, Master Mario.
[17:33.13]Oh, Mario, you're okay after all.
[17:36.05]I just knew you would be.
[17:38.15]We got our first cleaning job.
[17:39.45]First cleaning gig.
[17:42.61]Don't hold the R button so hard.
[17:44.37]Huh?
[17:44.69]I didn't do anything.
[17:47.25]And why is the sky so dark?
[17:48.60]It's not sun-drenched.
[17:51.00]This is hardly my idea of a relaxing vacation, Mario.
[17:53.58]I'm gonna go home right now.
[17:57.92]Oh, I can't do that.
[17:58.76]Oh, that guy was in the mud.
[18:07.01]You good?
[18:11.18]Oh, you have to clean people.
[18:12.54]What do you have to say about that?
[18:13.46]Phew, you saved me.
[18:17.40]Thanks a bunch.
[18:18.86]Don't you have to hold it down?
[18:23.41]Yeah, it's to aim.
[18:29.03]So water kills these guys.
[18:32.99]This is so fun.
[18:33.79]Do you get a bonus or anything for cleaning?
[18:40.78]Yes, I know this is another cleaning game.
[18:45.45]Yes, okay, don't worry.
[18:46.63]We will go back to the blood and violence and murdering people with axes video game some other day.
[18:53.63]But this is like we're cleaning houses and shit this week.
[18:56.03]And the week before.
[18:56.75]And the week before that.
[18:57.63]And cooking and stuff.
[18:58.57]Whatever.
[19:01.90]Seems like some people have gone missing.
[19:04.67]Near the Grand Pinata.
[19:07.69]I'm never going to say that, right?
[19:13.35]Thanks, Mario.
[19:22.68]You know what I feel like I'm playing right now?
[19:24.48]Binding of Isaac.
[19:25.42]Of course, I don't know why.
[19:26.76]Why am I getting that vibe?
[19:28.48]I don't know why.
[19:44.49]You gonna open your mouth?
[19:45.47]Wait, do I have to play something else?
[19:51.03]Play the rest of the junk?
[19:53.67]There you go.
[19:57.13]This is so fun.
[19:58.39]How did I not play this ever?
[20:01.66]How is it even possible that I didn't play this?
[20:03.52]Spin the stick?
[20:15.16]You know, it's Metal Mario.
[20:23.29]Oh, I already know the spoiler here.
[20:24.75]Yeah, I already know this.
[20:35.07]Go!
[20:38.79]A kidnapping!
[20:39.31]Stop the criminal!
[20:40.11]With some water!
[20:43.07]Alright, but...
[20:47.49]I'm sorry.
[20:49.77]I'm sorry.
[20:56.77]I'm sorry.
[21:07.13]Let's go!
[21:13.05]I don't know if this is Binding of Isaac.
[21:14.69]Why?
[21:16.27]Why is it the same game in my brain?
[21:17.55]Why don't I just hover?
[21:33.28]These are useless cups.
[21:39.56]You want to shoot water while moving.
[21:42.04]Oh, right.
[21:45.14]I like cleaning up the whole town.
[21:47.77]Alright, do it.
[21:48.45]More!
[21:55.30]Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[21:56.00]Not fair.
[21:56.44]Completely unfair.
[21:57.64]You shouldn't be allowed to use tools like that.
[22:04.92]Mari, I'm sure I saw that person out on the airship.
[22:07.38]I'm positively responsible for all this casing.
[22:14.78]Dibs.
[22:19.16]Well, that's old news.
[22:29.45]The suspected kidnapper was last seen escaping through the eastern fruit market.
[22:37.44]Yeah, I mean, isn't that where I am?
[22:43.36]Chase him.
[22:43.76]Well, I don't even know where he is.
[22:45.96]This is the fruit market.
[22:49.59]He's got a negative IQ.
[22:54.26]I have to just run straight?
[22:57.32]I didn't see him?
[22:58.12]No, I was looking.
[22:59.58]I'm so... I'm all over the place today, guys.
[23:02.70]I'm like looking at all different places.
[23:04.50]I was looking down.
[23:05.22]I was looking at my phone.
[23:06.76]I'm like all over the place.
[23:07.80]I wasn't looking at all.
[23:08.62]I have no idea.
[23:10.35]He's heading for the square.
[23:11.39]Go get him.
[23:14.33]I was looking at him.
[23:15.11]The camera was pointed at him, but I wasn't looking at the camera.
[23:19.61]I was looking over somewhere else during that cutscene.
[23:32.11]He's not even looking.
[23:32.67]I wouldn't even look at the screen.
[23:33.89]I swear to God.
[23:39.94]I swear.
[23:40.28]There he is.
[23:52.63]He escaped into the graffiti.
[23:53.83]Try spraying it with water.
[24:01.49]That didn't work!
[24:05.11]Oh, it did.
[24:12.76]Bianco Hills.
[24:14.90]Episode 1, Road to the Big Windmill.
[24:24.22]Oh, yeah.
[24:25.26]So it's like paintings from Mario 64, but they're graffiti in this one.
[24:32.41]There's probably secrets, too.
[24:33.43]There's another link.
[24:33.97]Alright, let's test the sync, by the way.
[24:39.65]Jump.
[24:40.45]Jump.
[24:41.19]Jump.
[24:41.93]Jump.
[24:42.73]Jump.
[24:43.96]Jump.
[24:48.90]We good?
[24:49.98]Alright, let's go.
[24:50.36]Oh, you're back again, are you?
[24:57.02]You seem like you were in such a hurry last time I saw you.
[25:03.22]There's probably, like, secrets and shit everywhere.
[25:07.70]Ooh, wait, is that Frank?
[25:14.33]Whoa.
[25:15.25]Hold on.
[25:15.71]There's a little, uh, thing I can walk on.
[25:20.61]I gotta get that coin.
[25:24.71]Holy shit, he found the slide.
[25:26.91]Can I go down the slide backwards like in all the other Mario games?
[25:30.81]What do you mean he found the slide?
[25:39.39]It's right here.
[25:43.93]Dude, you found the fucking slide, dude.
[25:47.19]It's the first thing you see in the whole game.
[25:49.97]Dude, hog, you found the slide.
[26:04.75]Okay, let's keep going.
[26:05.71]You need the plane?
[26:06.81]Anybody?
[26:07.79]There's a trail here that connects to the big windmill.
[26:11.99]The group made it too dangerous, so the door's been closed.
[26:14.83]You'll not be able to get through at the water wheel up ahead.
[26:17.13]You guys evil?
[26:23.24]I mean, can I... Oh, just like in the original Super Mario Bros.
[26:27.04]Versus game.
[26:28.94]You knock things upside down and you can hit them.
[26:36.56]You murderer.
[26:37.24]Alright, let's go.
[26:40.06]Uh, let's go this way Blood all over the wall.
[26:50.05]Oh, it's dirt
[27:03.76]This game is too violent.
[27:05.50]It's good.
[27:06.66]It's good, don't worry.
[27:08.28]Alright, what am I missing?
[27:11.15]People to talk to?
[27:11.73]Hmm.
[27:12.61]Really?
[27:13.01]What are you saying?
[27:13.65]If I go like this...
[27:38.44]Can I do that from here?
[27:39.46]Got it!
[27:53.73]Oh, can I jump up on that?
[27:59.51]It's plus one coin, nice.
[28:09.07]Oh, aw, that was so cool.
[28:10.03]Alright, let's get that one coin.
[28:19.39]Use the hover nozzle.
[28:22.55]Could.
[28:23.79]You did it too slow.
[28:26.19]I'm on the rooftops now, though.
[28:27.31]Alright, um... What's his name?
[28:33.38]I don't know, like Ugly Mario, whatever his name is.
[28:35.70]Ugly Mario went the other way.
[28:38.74]Well, like, what's he called in this game?
[28:41.30]Like, Evil Mario?
[28:42.34]What's that?
[28:42.90]What's that?
[28:43.88]Amorphous Mario?
[28:44.76]What's his name?
[28:48.04]No, not Wario.
[28:49.16]The guy that's, like, goo and evil.
[28:52.06]Dumb Mario.
[28:57.07]Shadow Mario.
[28:58.27]There you go.
[29:00.75]Wait, can I do... Oh, look at that.
[29:05.91]Windmill?
[29:09.24]Oh, come on, really?
[29:10.04]There's something up there?
[29:12.54]There's gotta be something on here.
[29:13.74]Fuck.
[29:23.32]Oh, look!
[29:24.84]Wait, there's a big windmill!
[29:25.88]We're going this way.
[29:26.90]Wait!
[29:28.02]Yeah.
[29:33.32]Press X, I found a pole.
[29:34.98]Yeah, I found a big pole.
[29:42.09]Nice.
[29:42.45]Check this out.
[29:48.93]Whoa!
[29:50.82]Oh, wow!
[29:53.90]Look at all that dirt!
[30:08.43]What's this?
[30:08.73]A super coin!
[30:10.01]You got a super coin!
[30:11.57]Collect 10 of them.
[30:13.87]Collect 10 of them, then visit the boat house in Delfino Plaza.
[30:18.09]Ah, I'm gonna just like crack my hand.
[30:25.57]I'm ready, let's go.
[30:29.35]Anything else up here?
[30:30.41]Wait!
[30:30.61]There's a water, there's a water mill.
[30:34.55]I fucked up, it's okay.
[30:35.63]I pressed, I tried to do something fancy.
[30:37.20]It's alright, let's do this.
[30:44.74]Not helping at all?
[30:55.63]Dude, that's so much more efficient.
[30:56.91]Alright, stock up the water.
[30:59.27]Now, does it matter that this is, like, salt water or fresh water?
[31:01.56]Does that matter?
[31:02.04]It's like, you don't want to use, like, salt water on the plane.
[31:10.10]Okay.
[31:17.29]What's the average playtime of this game?
[31:20.57]Anybody know?
[31:21.25]Was it like 16, 18 hours?
[31:27.10]It's gonna take me a very, very long fucking time to beat this game.
[31:42.73]Like, I can't help it.
[31:46.19]Same reasons why I had to stop playing Luigi's Mansion.
[31:50.50]I have to do it.
[31:52.30]Look at this, it has to- aww.
[31:55.00]Alright, let's work on this.
[32:00.07]It's gotta be 100% clean.
[32:00.89]Does this hurt you?
[32:11.47]You're never going to get this clean.
[32:12.69]Yes, I am.
[32:13.21]I'm going to get rid of the dirty melted chocolate ball.
[32:17.45]It's alright.
[32:22.53]There we go.
[32:40.17]Teach him spin cleaning.
[32:42.15]Whoa, what did I just do?
[32:45.47]Am I firing a gun?
[32:46.33]Is that like a cannon?
[32:49.75]I just pressed A. Go on, open your mouth.
[32:57.06]Is that like a, it's like a, ooh, it's like a shotgun.
[33:09.01]Ooh, got myself a moon.
[33:10.85]Wait, this is not Mario Galaxy.
[33:12.13]Not Mario Galaxy.
[33:12.83]Mario... Mario It's a Weird Wild World, whatever it's called.
[33:18.93]No!
[33:21.21]That was a bit all the way down.
[33:22.41]There we go.
[33:30.00]Made a wink.
[33:30.38]Yeah, we actually had a couple.
[33:38.85]Yeah, Winx are not on sale yet.
[33:41.70]I didn't tell you the plan.
[33:43.54]So the plan for Winx are going to go as follows.
[33:48.34]At some point over the next few days, we're streaming Mario Sunshine until I pretty much get it done.
[33:55.99]Then, we've got Community Content Night this weekend.
[33:58.61]I'm going to block off a probably 20 to 30 minute section of Community Content Night.
[34:06.47]whether somewhere at the front or somewhere at the end, where I go full cam and just sit there for 30 fucking straight minutes while Winx are at least 50 to 75% off.
[34:25.18]It's the only way that it makes any sense.
[34:34.74]You're gonna fuck up your eye?
[34:35.86]You blink every day.
[34:37.91]A trillion times a day or something.
[34:48.40]Deb's Alert.
[34:49.10]Isle Delfino Police are investigating a possible connection between recent graffiti incidents and the loss of contact with Bianco Hills and Rico Harbor.
[35:09.32]Right.
[35:09.84]Okay, so this is what happens when you have your phone on airplane mode for like a day or two, and you don't realize it, and you go, oh fuck, I only turned off airplane mode.
[35:17.30]You get news stories from like three days ago.
[35:21.04]Alright, I'm going back in.
[35:23.82]This is a Mario game, man.
[35:24.90]You gotta do them all.
[35:32.51]Down with Petey Piranha.
[35:34.99]Road to the big windmill, and then down with Petey Piranha.
[35:43.66]He's up all the way at the top of the windmill.
[35:45.78]Looks like he's got his, uh... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's... He's...
[36:06.12]How do we go from here?
[36:07.09]What was that?
[36:08.27]Can I move this log by running?
[36:11.47]No, I can't.
[36:13.25]Alright, so we gotta get up there.
[36:17.88]But this is now open because we cleared it.
[36:22.62]Okay, I'll see you in about 20 minutes.
[36:29.23]What if I...
[36:34.34]Okay, so if I press them together, I, like... Can I, like, spin?
[36:40.66]I'm just trying out the technique here.
[36:46.25]If I spin the analog, do I, like... Spin and press R.
[37:05.12]Whoa!
[37:06.10]Alright, that kind of worked.
[37:08.06]Jump, then press R. Dude, you're getting blasted.
[37:18.86]I'll be alright.
[37:20.06]Spin, then jump.
[37:32.80]Really?
[37:34.64]No, that's cheating!
[37:44.09]Why's it not working?
[37:49.95]No, when you clean, okay, when you clean your room or you clean your bathroom, you don't just hold two cans of Lysol in your hand, hold them both down, aerosol, and just spin in a fucking circle and... No, you don't.
[38:03.67]You get on, you get on your fucking hands and knees and you spray.
[38:06.91]And then you, you wipe the grunge off.
[38:16.70]Mario.
[38:17.63]Danger!
[38:17.99]Danger!
[38:18.25]Bridges out!
[38:18.71]Use my hover nozzle to cross the bridge!
[38:20.45]Why would I do that when I can just do this?
[38:29.00]What if I... I'm running out of water.
[38:34.14]He's gonna ignore me.
[38:36.76]He's gonna ignore me.
[38:37.44]Is there water up here?
[38:44.16]You can run while spraying.
[38:45.13]I know, but I like to really get in there.
[38:48.11]I like to really, like, get in there and see.
[38:54.37]Oh, I'm out of water.
[39:00.26]I know there's water right here, but... Is there any up top on the windmill?
[39:17.13]Ooh, almost.
[39:18.81]Alright, this is freaking me out.
[39:20.15]I hate this.
[39:20.75]I need to clean this.
[39:21.51]I don't know.
[39:30.36]I need to clean this.
[39:37.53]I thought you said there was water up here.
[39:39.50]Is there water up here in the window?
[39:41.22]I don't see any water.
[39:42.04]Oh, I'm gonna die!
[39:43.50]I can't die in a Mario game in the first level.
[40:04.56]Dying to Bianco Hills.
[40:08.60]No, I didn't.
[40:10.24]I'm preventing that.
[40:11.39]But I'd love to get this fucking other coin.
[40:14.01]Alright.
[40:14.55]Wait, hold on.
[40:15.11]Is this shit over here?
[40:15.83]I don't know these guys.
[40:28.16]Wait, what's that?
[40:28.74]What?
[40:36.87]Somebody over here!
[40:48.41]How do I reliably jump out of the water?
[40:50.76]Get the coins.
[40:53.88]I'm getting them!
[40:55.72]Alright, what does this guy do?
[40:57.38]There's a guy over here.
[41:06.98]I can't get up there?
[41:12.48]Okay, whatever.
[41:14.48]Sorry, yeah, I... This game is silly.
[41:18.06]Nothing there right now.
[41:18.93]Alright, let's go back and do what I was doing.
[41:20.69]Sorry, I'm getting distracted.
[41:27.05]Bring the lily pad.
[41:33.77]What in the name of fucking god just happened?
[41:39.12]Are these spikes?
[41:41.06]Okay, well... Double jump.
[41:52.74]I didn't even... I didn't even know that was going to happen.
[41:55.87]Hold on, let me fill this guy's veins with water.
[42:00.83]What?
[42:01.59]Did I... Maybe try using the hover nozzle here.
[42:06.53]I guess I just did.
[42:13.69]Alright, here we go.
[42:22.03]I want these coins.
[42:26.92]Oh, shit.
[42:28.32]Um... Oh, I- I- right, I have a hopper!
[42:32.90]I forget this is not like a regular Mario game.
[42:34.60]I can fly.
[42:35.40]Alright, right through the middle?
[42:43.73]Could you help out with the big-headed creature up there?
[42:45.63]You're the only one we can ask to lend us a hand.
[42:48.99]I know it's a pain, but you think you can handle it?
[42:52.08]Of course I can.
[42:55.86]Wait.
[42:56.12]That's a Super Coin.
[43:05.96]Dermot, the M, reee.
[43:08.34]The M, reee.
[43:11.32]Reee.
[43:12.82]Get the M, reee!
[43:16.62]Ooh, it is right up there.
[43:35.76]Alright, boss battle incoming.
[43:38.32]3, 2, 1.
[43:50.11]Breaking.
[43:54.43]The piranha's like a baby, right?
[43:55.65]It's like a big, goofy baby.
[44:00.17]That's how I see it.
[44:01.23]I'm under the impression that Petey Piranha is a big, unruly baby.
[44:10.30]Why would water hurt plants?
[44:13.60]Would it make it stronger?
[44:16.84]Thinking face.
[44:18.61]What's he doing?
[44:22.21]Oh, he is a baby.
[44:23.97]Up.
[44:47.64]I'm trying to stomp on him.
[44:59.45]Alright, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[45:00.37]I'm gonna fill his mouth when he opens it.
[45:02.51]Okay, I get it.
[45:03.97]No, I don't.
[45:04.39]What is that?
[45:05.19]Is he just gonna be present?
[45:06.43]Alright, open your mouth.
[45:12.47]Holy shit, this is actually what you have to do?
[45:14.01]This is horrible.
[45:14.59]Oh!
[45:15.10]Oh!
[45:16.63]And then step on his belly button!
[45:18.71]Here we go, right here
[45:48.17]Get it!
[45:49.25]Get it!
[45:50.11]Dude, this is, like, kind of fucked up.
[45:57.45]Again.
[46:00.37]Come on.
[46:01.35]Actually, he's concerned to do it now.
[46:03.83]Oh, almost.
[46:04.49]Come on.
[46:05.37]Come on!
[46:08.10]Open.
[46:09.50]It's a ring.
[46:21.00]Three times.
[46:21.76]That was smooth.
[46:24.42]Ooh.
[46:24.76]Whoa, that's like all his guts.
[46:31.31]Yes!
[46:50.09]How many of those stars are in the game?
[46:51.60]120?
[46:51.64]There's 120?
[46:53.62]Wow.
[46:59.96]Something's opening up here.
[47:01.30]A dock?
[47:02.36]Yes.
[47:03.34]Alert.
[47:04.51]This just in.
[47:19.76]The boathouse west of town has disappeared What do you want?
[47:34.36]Scroll faster Let's go investigate
[47:43.79]Mario, what's going on over here?
[47:46.25]This darkness makes me feel gloomy and depressed.
[47:49.27]It's been this way ever since our shine sprites went away.
[47:52.30]This is your fault and you don't even look apologetic.
[47:57.94]Something about being available.
[48:15.21]That was a collective No
[48:48.43]Fire!
[48:53.42]Streamer's ignoring the game depth.
[48:59.14]What are you talking about?
[49:07.88]Streamer ignoring game depth.
[49:16.67]That's not even... Why?
[49:19.03]It doesn't... You guys are so fucking quick, it's ridiculous.
[49:36.06]This is a party.
[49:37.16]Alright, look, we have a new one.
[49:49.56]Do I want to go in there or do I... Yeah, I wanna.
[50:03.67]What happened to finishing the old one?
[50:05.65]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[50:06.93]I've never fucking said anything like that before in my entire life.
[50:09.61]You're making shit up.
[50:11.01]I don't appreciate things being made up about me.
[50:15.49]Gooper blooper breakout!
[50:24.01]Ooh, this looks interesting.
[50:28.45]What's in there?
[50:28.95]Looks like a tiger in there?
[50:31.11]Coin?
[50:38.70]What do you do with coins in this game?
[50:40.84]Are they, uh, like every other Mario game besides Odyssey, where it was a useless collection for no reason?
[50:53.85]Besides the heal?
[50:54.69]Yeah.
[50:56.11]Alright, Jeremy.
[50:57.95]Jeremy, what the fuck are you doing?
[51:00.42]You used to- you got like three years- four- five years ago.
[51:03.20]Six years ago.
[51:03.82]You could get like 40 kills in one life as a Demoman.
[51:08.22]What are you doing?
[51:08.98]You can't even like- Pay attention.
[51:11.07]Jesus.
[51:11.57]Door 1, 2, or 3.
[51:14.41]Wait, is this- this is trash, right?
[51:22.11]This is like sea trash!
[51:24.88]and I know it is because it's squid and octopus gross what's this oh calamari's delicious
[51:52.75]Is this so I don't look directly into the sun?
[51:54.34]What's that for?
[51:54.92]Alright, let's go break out the... What is this?
[52:16.95]What the fuck?
[52:17.76]Do I just have to keep going?
[52:19.14]Where does this end up?
[52:20.22]Wait, I can go up here?
[52:22.42]How do I get up that?
[52:50.88]I have to move the boxes.
[52:52.18]Luigi, help me.
[52:53.06]I'm in the sewer.
[52:56.31]How many times do you think Luigi got a weird phone call from Mario?
[52:59.85]If people talk a lot of shit about Luigi, I'm included.
[53:01.81]I talk shit about Luigi all the time.
[53:03.45]But he's definitely the one that gets the phone call that's like, Luigi, I'm under some boxes in the Alpino Plaza.
[53:10.23]I'm in the sewer.
[53:12.14]And Luigi's just saying, oh, my God.
[53:14.26]Alright, I'll be there in five minutes.
[53:21.35]Are these all covered?
[53:27.59]I gotta move all these boxes.
[53:29.46]How far does this go?
[53:30.62]What the fuck?
[53:36.36]Alright, move all boxes.
[53:40.84]Wait, can I go up here?
[53:41.81]Luigi, please!
[53:51.07]And Luigi, could you also bring me some Clif bars?
[54:11.23]Mario they don't have them at the 7-eleven down the street.
[54:15.09]Oh well according to My find a store near you.
[54:20.23]It's at the 7-eleven eight miles away Luigi.
[54:23.69]Thank you I know you'd be doing it for your brother.
[54:26.22]These are terrible voices Can I climb up?
[54:38.98]No, it's blocked
[54:45.25]Mario.
[54:57.58]Do Mario and Luigi live in the same house?
[55:01.70]They don't, right?
[55:02.22]That's never been clear, has it?
[55:10.55]Okay, they do.
[55:11.49]They do.
[55:12.93]How big is Mario's bedroom versus Luigi's bedroom?
[55:15.77]Like, who gets the master bedroom?
[55:19.34]Is it Mario?
[55:21.94]Where does Luigi sleep?
[55:23.30]How many rooms are in that house?
[55:24.36]Mario.
[55:30.51]There's even bunk beds!
[55:31.89]Do they actually...?
[55:42.74]Luigi has three mansions?
[55:45.80]No, Luigi got stuck in three places.
[55:50.44]Flip through this.
[55:51.02]Okay, that's cool.
[55:53.51]That's not Luigi's mansion.
[55:54.97]That Luigi gets stuck in three places.
[55:57.29]That's it.
[55:58.53]Wait, have I gone in there?
[56:00.55]Yeah.
[56:01.49]Alright, well, what do you have to say?
[56:03.31]Watch out, there's a fucking ghost behind you.
[56:13.11]He doesn't... He does own them, though.
[56:18.23]Look, how the fuck do I know this?
[56:19.29]I played the first, like, 45 minutes of Luigi's Mansion 3.
[56:24.11]Huh, you think the area was pointing that way on purpose?
[56:27.00]R-r-really?
[56:30.74]Oh, that's just you being an asshole.
[56:32.14]Okay.
[56:51.31]Oh, you can climb up here.
[56:55.40]Can I punch through?
[56:56.36]Alright, where's the thing that's trapped?
[57:02.80]Over there?
[57:04.80]Back there?
[57:06.23]Where's the actual goal here?
[57:11.97]Luigi wasn't in Mario 64 for this.
[57:14.05]He was trading cryptocurrencies.
[57:30.93]Whoa!
[57:31.33]Fuck.
[57:34.79]Wait, let me block it.
[57:46.32]Is that just a shortcut?
[57:54.32]I remember when my brother and I used to play Mario 64, and I was terrible.
[57:59.00]I never got it.
[57:59.56]I was like, I can't jump on anything.
[58:01.22]I keep missing everything.
[58:02.48]Why?
[58:02.80]I don't know how to time it.
[58:04.12]He's like, Jeremy, man.
[58:06.30]Just use the shadows.
[58:08.30]Once you see the shadow go over the bottom, you know you're in the right place.
[58:11.07]Thanks.
[58:13.57]Yeah.
[58:14.13]And it worked.
[58:22.57]And then he gave me a quick little punch like, hey, man, you ready for dinner?
[58:28.64]Oh, yeah.
[58:31.37]Mom's making lasagna tonight.
[58:33.31]What?
[58:33.93]No way, man.
[58:35.63]Race you upstairs.
[58:36.31]No, no, no, no.
[58:37.91]No, me first.
[58:55.47]Alright, what am I doing?
[59:12.80]I forgot.
[59:14.97]Smash this!
[59:18.07]I have the shortcut to here.
[59:20.65]Ooh!
[59:22.51]Isaac!
[59:23.23]One up!
[59:28.67]Let's go in both.
[59:31.12]Can I make it from here?
[59:32.02]Can I climb it?
[59:35.04]It was hovering me.
[59:35.92]It was hovering around me in a circle.
[59:37.32]Guys, this game is just whining about it.
[59:38.70]I don't know what you think we're playing.
[59:41.63]Wait.
[59:52.67]Use the hover nozzle.
[59:53.53]No, it's going to take a little bit of getting used to.
[59:57.33]I've never used it.
[59:58.01]This is the first time I've ever played a video game.
[60:00.11]I've never even opened it.
[60:01.61]First time ever opened it.
[60:03.25]Alright, we're good.
[60:09.67]Back to what I was doing.
[60:14.60]The first video is a sealed copy.
[60:15.98]It was.
[60:17.00]This was $480.
[60:17.28]Sure, could I have bought a used one for, like, $22?
[60:21.80]But I wanted a real one.
[60:23.47]I wanted to be able to pretend like it was me opening it the first time.
[60:27.33]So I opened up the sealed copy and shit, and... Pretended like I was, you know, like, Hey, bro!
[60:33.17]Look what I got!
[60:34.83]No way!
[60:35.61]What is that, man?
[60:37.15]Hey, Mario Sunshine!
[60:40.17]Oh, what?
[60:40.77]Punch in the arm.

[60:44.74]Yeah, you already played?
[60:45.82]Okay, I'll switch off every life, dude.
[61:07.45]Where are you guys going?
[61:11.94]You want me to toss you all the way across the port?
[61:14.88]Sorry, but I don't have that kind of power yet.
[61:16.72]You think I can throw you?
[61:22.10]I heard that you can raise the sub by spinning that thing.
[61:25.98]How in the world are you supposed to do that?
[61:27.26]You don't happen to know, do you?
[61:30.85]Oh.

[66:10.09]Yep.
[66:10.71]Welcome.
[66:12.87]Thanks for checking out the stream.
[66:18.30]Back in like 2014, I made a video where I killed like 50 people in one life with the Huntsman.
[66:24.50]And it was on a map that was huge.
[66:26.50]Like Badlands or something.
[66:27.56]Which is like almost fucking impossible to use that item.
[66:31.56]And like people talked about it for years.
[66:33.24]People actually talked about it.
[66:34.26]I see the video pop up in the threads.
[66:48.35]He's googling his own name.
[67:00.98]Alright.
[67:02.08]You want... You want me to be honest with you guys?
[67:06.36]You wouldn't?
[67:07.42]You wouldn't type in, like, Jerma985?
[67:10.88]You know how many times over the last 10 years?
[67:12.98]I've been doing this for 10 years.
[67:14.97]Sometimes I'm like, oh, I'm curious.
[67:16.71]Like, Jerma985 sucks.
[67:19.17]Jerma985, bad video.
[67:22.01]Jerma985, cool.
[67:24.87]Jerma985, he's like a punchman.
[67:28.51]You know, you just, and like, what are people saying?
[67:30.94]Jerma985, bad YouTuber.
[67:33.20]Like, okay, what the, I need to know why.
[67:37.44]Jerma985, handsome.
[67:39.54]Type that like three times.
[67:52.52]No, I'm not even saying that one blooper surfing Safari You are your own market research team.
[68:02.84]Yeah, I'm the only one that works for my own personal company I Don't have a market research guy.
[68:09.76]That's me.
[68:11.66]I'm just Jerma nine eight five.
[68:13.16]I scream on Twitch I don't have like a marketing team
[68:21.71]What would... Can I, like, leave here?
[68:24.13]I want to see that cutscene again.
[68:25.75]I was not even looking at the screen.
[68:27.05]Again.
[68:31.84]I'll find it.
[68:36.40]Whatever.
[68:38.40]You know, there sure are some odd folks out there.
[68:41.36]Haming little bloopers is bizarre enough, but riding on their backs.
[68:44.58]I tell you, some folks are just plain loony.
[68:49.93]Got it.
[68:51.77]Thanks God this game is idiot-proof.
[68:56.53]Wait, I have to ride a frog?
[69:07.04]That's right, I'm the Big Daddy of bloopers-surfing.
[69:09.42]If you like surfing, hop on a blooper and give it a whirl.
[69:11.88]Oh, but one thing, Big Daddy waives all liability for accidents.
[69:15.75]Now hang loose, bud.
[69:21.35]Alright.
[69:21.97]Green.
[69:24.37]Yellow.
[69:24.75]Well, pink.
[69:25.25]Well, it's going to be a Jerma985 color.
[69:28.55]That's a Jerma985 color.
[69:29.97]That's a Jerma985 color.
[69:32.65]That's not a Jerma985 color.
[69:34.11]Hmm.
[69:59.07]Can I jump?
[70:01.99]I got it, right?
[70:09.41]That's it.
[70:12.76]Wahoo!
[70:13.72]You want to go for a ride, bud?
[70:15.50]Go ahead and jump on the blooper you like best.
[70:17.44]Give me some super blooper surfing and win yourself a prize.
[70:32.38]I thought I had to jump them.
[70:33.70]I thought I had to jump it.
[70:35.20]I thought I had to jump it.
[70:37.80]Pretty relaxed.
[70:39.44]Thought I had to jump it.
[70:53.39]Can I go faster?
[70:55.55]Yeah, if I hold, I can hold up.
[71:01.66]Alright, now that I know that.
[71:12.91]Alright, let's see if I can do it again.
[71:15.95]Probably just gotta be under a minute, right?
[71:19.79]Pretty weak, bud.
[71:20.45]That's not even worth talking about.
[71:21.93]Come back after you've conquered the kiddie pool.
[71:29.96]Wait, I get sent all the way out to the... All the way out here.
[71:33.21]Oh, fuck.
[71:46.27]What?
[71:46.87]Hold on, I've got some fucking cup surgery to do here.
[71:49.84]Hold on a second, give me a minute.
[71:54.25]Why did I even do this?
[71:55.17]I'm fucking... I'm stupid.
[71:57.39]Okay?
[71:58.35]I'm gonna paint you a picture here.
[71:59.53]Just think about this.
[72:00.11]Listen to what I have to say.
[72:02.01]I have a container.
[72:03.30]That's like a coffee container.
[72:05.92]So I drank all the coffee out of here.
[72:08.62]It was like half full.
[72:10.06]Whatever.
[72:10.54]It was not very much.
[72:12.58]Kim and I split this.
[72:14.92]so I got I brought another little can of coffee I like the cans of coffee so I was like oh when I'm done drinking this I'll just refill it with the can why would I open up this container to pour this into another container why wouldn't I just drink it out of the can just drink it out of like it's designed to be drank
[72:37.27]Yes, there are, like, cans and bottles of coffee.
[72:39.35]You can get them anywhere.
[72:40.91]You can order them on Amazon, you get them special ordered, you get them at, like, grocery stores.
[72:44.03]Guys, you can get, like, cans of, like, cold brew coffee.
[72:47.66]You're unique.
[72:49.38]Is there a link?
[72:59.94]Let me just double check.
[73:13.66]This time, no messing up.
[73:19.78]I don't even need this.
[73:24.31]We go fast.
[73:26.63]Chain squid?
[73:27.29]No, no, no.
[73:27.93]Always bring it.
[73:37.44]Pink, pink, pink, pink.
[73:38.80]Fine, I'll do pink.
[73:40.56]Oh, you want to go for a ride?
[73:41.58]Try it again.
[73:42.12]Fine, I'll do... colors at different speeds.
[73:46.59]That's a lie.
[73:47.17]I've never heard such, like, a crock of shit in my life.
[74:08.77]Somebody said press A. A jumps.
[74:49.11]Why is pink slower?
[74:52.04]Press X?
[74:52.74]Okay, shit.
[74:55.56]Press the power button.
[75:00.21]I'm doing- I'm doing green.
[75:04.93]Green's faster.
[75:05.41]Look at that.
[75:07.77]Green's actually faster.
[75:45.51]There we go.
[75:49.33]You're grinding that blooper's face onto the ground.
[75:51.49]No, come on, do it.
[75:54.33]I'm sorry, I have to fucking do it like this.
[75:57.04]It's been like this since I was a kid.
[75:59.02]Fuck.
[75:59.26]Whatever.
[76:21.86]Play the level again.
[76:22.64]Oh, you're not a kid anymore.
[76:31.06]Says you, I took the Toys R Us commercial.
[76:33.44]Literally.
[76:35.78]They fucked up a whole generation of us.
[76:38.36]No, it's their... Okay.
[76:47.59]I'm never gonna grow up, I'm a Toys R Us kid.
[76:49.94]I don't wanna grow up, I'm a Toys R Us kid.
[76:52.30]I'll always be a Toys R Us kid.
[76:55.30]And then that company got fucking liquidated, and now we're all fucked up.
[76:57.94]Thanks a lot, Toys R Us.
[77:13.89]Toys R Us is...
[77:19.41]That's why I... Okay, I'm going to move on from this.
[77:22.43]What is this thing?
[77:25.72]This is one of my nozzles.
[77:26.92]The... Oh, you cannot use it yet.
[77:28.66]It's only a hologram.
[77:35.50]He doesn't know.
[77:39.98]It's okay, Jerma.
[77:40.67]Come to Canada.
[77:41.31]We still have Toys R Us.
[77:45.47]That place was ridiculous.
[77:54.23]They left.
[77:54.63]Idiot.
[77:56.00]I didn't do anything.
[77:56.88]Alright, what was this, uh, thing that I'm doing here?
[78:01.32]What do we got?
[78:01.94]Anything new?
[78:02.56]Guy throws me.
[78:05.70]Onto the boat.
[78:07.27]Ooh.
[78:09.05]Christmas.
[78:09.51]Alright.
[78:25.61]No, what are you doing, Mario?
[78:26.63]Why don't you get off?
[78:27.23]I didn't even say to get off.
[78:28.13]Wait.
[78:29.01]Anything down here?
[78:31.17]Alright, hold on.
[78:35.80]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[78:38.60]What does that do, though?
[78:39.22]Does it slow me down?
[78:43.64]Is that... Can I hover by doing that?
[78:52.02]Oh, it's if I touch the top.
[78:54.18]Oh!
[78:54.58]If I...
[78:56.94]Okay, if I touch the top.
[78:58.68]I'm understanding the mechanics of video games now.
[79:04.86]Okay, anybody else have this problem in Mario?
[79:07.45]It's been like this since I was a kid.
[79:08.85]Since I fucking went to Toys R Us.
[79:10.95]When you jump and you make a jump, you press A again for some reason.
[79:14.61]You're like, here's the jump, jump.
[79:15.93]No, no, I didn't want to.
[79:17.09]I press it twice sometimes.
[79:18.32]Like, even after I land.
[79:23.98]Is this a me problem?
[79:34.90]Come on.
[79:38.62]Panic jump is really... Yeah, it's like a panic jump.
[79:44.26]Because I think... My brain doesn't understand that I'm going to make the jump that I just did.
[79:48.83]So it's like, wait, you should do that again.
[79:50.27]Alright, we're just going to dump on this guy.
[79:58.53]That's going to be tricky here.
[80:00.10]Hold on.
[80:10.67]And now where we want to go that way?
[80:11.97]I gotta turn.
[80:13.61]I don't fall off, do I?
[80:20.36]Easy.
[80:22.16]Hey.
[80:23.50]Hey.
[80:24.60]Hey!
[80:31.36]Wait till the next turn.
[80:32.20]Don't just panic.
[80:33.26]Hurry.
[80:33.42]Need to have some brain fluid.
[80:40.01]I had a half of a burrito this boy.
[80:41.45]Does that count?
[80:49.60]It does, right?
[80:52.80]I can't believe they got rid of the punch in, uh... Okay.
[80:58.90]I was just gonna call this Mario Q.
[81:07.75]Mario cubed.
[81:13.25]I don't know.
[81:14.34]I can open this, though.
[81:15.10]This is one of my nozzles, the GAD Science Hover Nozzle.
[81:19.86]So, how do I get it?
[81:21.12]Oh shit, this is not good.
[81:25.99]What did I just get?
[81:33.31]What does it do?
[81:33.75]Is it just a refill?
[81:36.61]Just a refill.
[81:37.27]Oh, okay.
[81:38.79]What's your problem?
[81:40.81]Oh, you made it all the way here.
[81:43.27]Hey, by the way, have you spoken to that guy on the roof over there?
[81:49.03]No, I haven't.
[81:51.59]That guy, I just murdered.
[81:53.32]Oh!
[82:16.65]I guess we died all over again.
[82:23.76]Where... I have to go from here to... Can I get there from... How in the world can I get up there?
[82:45.10]No, I don't want to do that.
[82:46.70]Stop doing that.
[82:47.26]Stop doing the cool thing.
[82:48.90]Stop doing the cool thing!
[82:49.76]I just wanted the regular thing!
[83:00.95]I get it.
[83:01.35]Wait.
[83:04.51]Suck it up.
[83:15.54]Alright, no fucking up this time.
[83:18.42]Shit.
[83:20.02]I was too busy looking at the guy that I killed.
[83:25.53]Turn, Mario.
[83:27.53]Oh my god, Mario.
[83:28.67]Mario, you gotta get a cliff bar in you, man.
[83:33.50]By the way, I don't eat those.
[83:35.45]I'm just saying that for some reason.
[83:37.51]Those are... Any protein bar or meal replacement bar takes me so long to eat.
[83:44.61]Please get here.
[83:47.95]It takes like 40 minutes to eat a fucking flip-flop.
[83:53.85]They're so dense and so nutrient-packed.
[84:06.34]When I take a bite of a Clif Bar, I know I'm going to be chewing that thing for at least two to three minutes.
[84:11.56]Nope.
[84:11.98]Nope.
[84:12.84]Nope.
[84:13.12]What am I doing?
[84:14.60]Wait a minute.
[84:15.42]Oh my god.
[84:16.68]What's happening?
[84:17.46]What the fuck was that?
[84:18.38]Grab the... Mario, what the fuck is going on?
[84:21.96]Why wouldn't he... It's alright.
[84:24.80]Everything's fine.
[84:26.61]Oh god damn it.
[84:29.27]I don't know what happened there.
[84:30.89]I really don't.
[84:39.28]I'm apparently going this way, though, for some reason.
[84:43.32]Where the fuck am I?
[84:45.00]Wait, what the?
[84:45.84]Wait, I'm going backwards.
[84:47.20]This is the way I need to go.
[84:49.76]Guys, I'm a little confused.
[84:52.06]Okay.
[84:54.51]I saw the lily pads and I had to jump off.
[85:03.75]I didn't do anything.
[85:04.45]I just pressed up.
[85:05.09]I was holding up.
[85:05.77]What happened?
[85:08.27]I was just holding up.
[85:09.91]What did I do?
[85:10.29]I don't get it.
[85:14.00]What happened?
[85:16.96]I'm holding up right now.
[85:18.32]Why did I fall off?
[85:20.30]Did I, did I touch, did I grab that guy's leg instead of... What happened?
[85:27.59]What happened?
[85:34.16]Holy shit, he's not pretending.
[85:36.45]No, not on that.
[85:37.15]I mean, everything else, yeah.
[85:40.72]Ha ha ha!
[85:48.73]As a streamer, let me level with you here.
[85:51.93]Do you know how, imagine, like, do you know how probably fucking horrible it would be to be sitting here and, like, pretending to lose?
[86:03.14]That would be so exhausting.
[86:05.00]Don't you think?
[86:05.52]Like, that would just be exhausting.
[86:08.28]Like, I'm up here right now.
[86:09.54]I'm gonna, like, just jump off and be like, no!
[86:11.96]Like, that's exhausting.
[86:23.38]Listen to your brother right here.
[86:41.89]Can I get up there?
[86:43.31]Hold on.
[86:44.21]Can I climb this?
[86:46.46]It just seems like I can climb this.
[86:51.66]Ooh, this is tricky.
[86:54.08]Oh, shit.
[86:57.79]Okay, I gotta go that way.
[86:59.01]Oh, fuck.
[87:00.25]I don't like this place.
[87:02.35]It's low.
[87:06.25]It's low!
[87:08.15]No need to run that fast.
[87:13.89]Let me just jump into that.
[87:14.83]That doesn't hit me in the head.
[87:19.87]Ooh!
[87:20.13]Super coin!
[87:20.87]Alright, I gotta get that coin.
[87:24.07]Okay, I'm... I'm freaking out.
[87:38.65]Look at this, too!
[87:39.30]There's three!
[87:39.80]Look at how many coins are here!
[87:46.29]Don't fall, MonkaS.
[87:48.73]Don't fall, MonkaS.
[87:50.01]Okay, the goal here is to go that way to get the coin.
[87:59.84]Slide it up.
[88:04.48]What's that?
[88:05.50]What's that thing?
[88:05.90]That's a tornado?
[88:06.42]I don't know if that's a tornado.
[88:15.90]No!
[88:16.32]I have to go back.
[88:24.83]Okay, I didn't know that thing did.
[88:26.25]I thought it was gonna blow me up.
[88:28.79]Oh, it's exhausting.
[88:30.99]I gotta pretend to get up here and fall again?
[88:32.89]This is so just draining me mentally.
[88:38.50]Oh, fuck.
[88:44.10]This place is kind of tricky.
[88:54.08]Oh, shit.
[88:54.56]Oh, my mic is on.
[88:55.70]That's another thing, right?
[88:59.92]Like, you know, like, the hot mic thing?
[89:04.27]If I was sitting here live to almost 6,000 fucking people right now, why would I ever, under any circumstances, like, hit the mute button and think that, like... Oh, now I can say literally whatever I want and my mic is turned off.
[89:22.71]That's so bad.
[89:23.75]That... What?
[89:33.02]Because you're stupid.
[89:41.94]Oh, that's... Is that why?
[89:44.13]I can still get it.
[89:44.69]Alright, I need to refill.
[89:52.73]Yep, I actually don't I hate this part.
[89:56.34]This is I hate not well instead soon.
[89:59.18]Yeah A hot mic.
[90:02.02]Oh, we hit the mute button to talk a bunch of shit about everybody.
[90:05.42]That's a good idea Where's that button right here press?
[90:10.68]Let me now say everything that I've ever wanted to say bad about everything.
[90:15.24]Oh Hot Mike whoops
[90:19.89]Almost like you should prepare to not say anything stupid when you're hooked up with a microphone on your neck.
[90:31.97]Don't fuck this up.
[90:39.78]Who's calling me right now?
[90:41.86]Who the fuck is this?
[90:56.33]Okay.
[90:57.61]What does it got?
[90:58.41]The wind guy.
[90:59.15]I'm just gonna run and then run back.
[91:00.59]Is this a stupid idea?
[91:01.87]Jesus.
[91:06.29]There was just three of them.
[91:07.70]They go away.
[91:08.26]They go away.
[91:24.53]Okay, now get that.
[91:25.29]Look at this, two more.
[91:27.02]Look at this shit.
[91:29.20]Doesn't do your brother.
[91:29.98]Got it.
[91:31.90]Got it.
[91:53.47]Now we walk back up.
[91:55.37]Do we?
[91:56.27]Walk back up?
[92:01.67]Wait.
[92:04.95]Wait.
[92:07.13]Wait!
[92:08.73]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[92:09.51]I can spray this.
[92:13.63]That means I can spray this, right?
[92:22.71]Do a backflip.
[92:23.89]How do you do a backflip in this one?
[92:26.86]How do you do a backflip in, uh, Mario Sunshine?
[92:31.00]Can you?
[92:35.06]Is there, like, no... Same way, left trigger... he... left trigger is his camera.
[92:43.91]Just have to do the quick jump one.
[92:51.01]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oi oi!
[92:55.88]Yeah, crouch jump, that's what I mean.
[93:02.14]God damn it, it's... I'm gonna fucking die.
[93:04.52]I'm done.
[93:05.76]I'm done.
[93:08.10]Well, at least I got the coins, whatever.
[93:12.18]There is no crouch jump, though.
[93:13.68]Oh, that's disgusting.
[93:25.77]This is exhausting.
[93:29.97]Oh, one of these days I want to like, have like a fucking fake audio leak or something of me.
[93:35.45]Like I'll record it through like a fucking cell, you know what I mean?
[93:37.61]Like, not like I'm calling somebody else.
[93:44.04]I just have to be like... Hey yo, what's up?
[93:49.24]Hey yo, what's up?
[93:54.35]I, uh, I just got done streaming.
[93:56.47]And it was fucking so annoying, dude.
[93:59.27]It was exhausting.
[94:00.15]I don't know, do you have, I'm just so sick of fucking, like, pretending to fall down off shit.
[94:05.30]And I know you do it, too.
[94:06.34]Like, everybody does it.
[94:06.98]We all do it.
[94:07.76]And I know it brings in fucking views.
[94:10.22]But I'm just so sick of it.
[94:11.74]It's so fucking exhausting.
[94:12.72]I'm not doing it anymore.
[94:14.10]Like, I'm just gonna do what I want to do on streaming.
[94:15.92]I think it's probably gonna be, like, painting.
[94:17.46]Like, sculpting and shit.
[94:19.60]I'm just so fucking sick of, like, pretending to be bad at video games.
[94:22.28]It's so annoying.
[94:24.66]If you're satisfied with this message, please press 1.
[94:28.76]If you'd like to... Neurotically listen to everything you just said to make sure you didn't sound like a total dickhead, press 2.
[95:00.89]Thank you.
[95:04.25]Here's what she said.
[95:06.55]Count the amount of times you say, uh.
[95:08.93]Was it too many?
[95:14.29]May as well redo the whole message.
[95:48.72]Someone just said, you're fucked up.
[95:54.00]Alright, let's go.
[95:58.52]I got all the coins though, so it's worth it.
[96:03.00]Dude, you're fucked up.
[96:03.84]I got all the coins though, so it's worth it.
[96:14.59]Okay, we're gonna follow the signs now.
[96:16.22]I got three of those coins.
[96:17.60]I'm excited about it.
[96:21.26]Let's go talk to this guy up here.
[96:29.62]Hey, just like in the movies, you know the scene?
[96:31.77]It's where something's on the manhole and they can't get it open.
[96:37.49]Oh, this is a shortcut!
[96:38.83]That's good to know.
[96:40.51]Get the coins.
[96:41.29]What does 100 coins get you in this?
[96:43.09]An extra life?
[96:43.65]Are there even any lives in this game?
[96:46.47]Is there one-ups?
[96:47.27]There are.
[97:05.05]Wait, you get a shine?
[97:06.01]But the... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[97:09.23]What?
[97:10.69]Didn't I ask if coins were useless in this game and everybody said yes?
[97:13.47]Everybody said yes!
[97:22.54]I was like, dude, are these, like, useless?
[97:23.76]They don't do anything?
[97:24.32]You just get, like, a one-up and everyone's like, yeah, yeah, sure.
[97:42.90]Alright, let's go.
[97:44.98]Up.
[97:49.42]Five Guys.
[97:50.11]Deception and lies.
[97:52.59]Hey!
[97:53.41]We found the guy that just turned the stream off.
[97:55.89]Now I want a hamburger.
[97:57.55]There it... Found him!
[97:59.53]Thanks for making this stream two hours long.
[98:03.90]You don't say anything about delicious foods while I'm streaming.
[98:08.50]That's a rule.
[98:09.02]I'm gonna put that in the fucking rules.
[98:12.60]Don't talk about delicious foods.
[98:14.44]Otherwise the stream will end.
[98:19.30]What kind of a fucking weirdo would you like... Would I have to actually be?
[98:25.59]We have simple rules here.
[98:26.63]You know, no bullshit.
[98:27.81]No, like, toxicity.
[98:28.85]Don't be, like, an asshole.
[98:30.33]Don't be, like, a racist dickhead.
[98:31.79]Don't, like, be a bigot.
[98:32.75]Like, really, like, simple, like, basic shit that we could all just do.
[98:36.19]Also, don't talk about food on my stream or you get banned and the stream ends.
[98:39.15]Oh.
[98:39.59]Oh.
[98:43.87]Okay.
[98:44.57]Yeah, no, just basic.
[98:46.46]Just stuff that everyone, like, fucking agrees with.
[98:48.20]Okay.
[98:49.08]That was risky, but I did it.
[98:51.72]The inverse does work, though.
[98:52.88]Holy shit.
[98:53.92]What is this?
[99:10.73]You got the rocket nozzle.
[99:12.53]Power up with R and blast off.
[99:17.31]I forgot you weren't watching a VOD.
[99:21.51]Holy shit.
[99:23.00]Okay.
[99:24.22]Do I get... Oh, it's a permanent... It's a permanent upgrade.
[99:30.84]Cool.
[99:31.56]So the red one's a permanent upgrade?
[99:36.02]I thought I had to do... I thought that was an indicator that you had to start... Okay, we're fine.
[99:50.41]Jeez, this guy sucks.
[99:52.48]Alright, I gotta... I gotta move.
[99:55.48]I'm just really wrecked.
[100:00.82]Fuck you, man.
[100:01.72]I hate these guys.
[100:02.64]I don't like these guys.
[100:03.40]Right into the hole.
[100:07.85]What?
[100:08.03]What's happening?
[100:13.05]Oh, shit, there it is!
[100:28.17]Is this like the mouse trap board game?
[100:30.95]It actually kind of is.
[100:32.43]Good observation.
[100:33.27]Give that guy a fucking sub, somebody.
[100:41.79]No?
[100:43.85]I will.
[100:44.13]What's his name?
[100:47.49]You do it.
[100:47.89]What's his name?
[100:48.77]Who said it?
[100:49.11]It's already gone.
[100:52.01]Who said it?
[100:55.05]What a liar.
[100:57.29]Oh, yeah?
[100:58.87]Oh, yeah?
[101:03.63]I'm a liar, huh?
[101:12.87]Okay.
[101:13.21]I'm a liar.
[101:13.63]It's me.
[101:14.05]We need to... Somebody find who that was.
[101:15.53]They're going to narrow it down.
[101:16.25]What'd they say?
[101:17.57]They said something that... What'd they say?
[101:19.25]They said something.
[101:24.29]Who said it?
[101:25.37]It was the mousetrap thing.
[101:26.55]Yep.
[101:26.95]Alright, so who said...
[101:34.23]The secret of Rico Tower.
[101:37.39]What was it?
[101:41.29]Somebody's got it open.
[101:44.23]Who's got it?
[101:45.91]It was... Dude, this level is just like the mousetrap board game.
[101:49.07]Laughing my ass off.
[101:49.97]And it was like... What was it?
[102:07.32]It's just like a mouse.
[102:09.10]We got it?
[102:09.52]Alright, we got it.
[102:12.46]Okay, I got it.
[102:13.58]Write that name down.
[102:15.04]How do you give a... Alright, write that name down.
[102:17.94]I'm going to write that name down over here.
[102:25.48]Write that name down.
[102:34.65]Where are we going now?
[102:36.39]We're going to the shortcut.
[102:41.21]Can you imagine a Mario game that they didn't put this in?
[102:50.43]Do you think they get annoyed that they have to put this in every single Mario game somewhere?
[102:57.37]Did you ever think about that?
[102:58.43]And they're like, oh, we have to, oh, wait, wait, we've done everything we've done so far.
[103:02.07]The game's done.
[103:03.86]Oh, fuck, we have to put dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun in the game somewhere or everyone's going to be mad.
[103:11.69]Just, I don't know, just throw it in here.
[103:16.23]Who cares?
[103:25.08]That's true, I would be mad.
[103:30.54]See?
[103:31.12]Boy, that sun's bright.
[103:32.30]Yeah, I need the sunglasses.
[103:33.44]This game sucks.
[103:40.41]Shit.
[103:47.65]Oh, is my microphone on?
[103:49.83]I bet you're muted to say that.
[104:07.96]Hey, what's up?
[104:08.64]I'm not, uh, available.
[104:09.77]Take the call right now.
[104:10.71]Leave a message when you get a chance.
[104:11.87]See you later.
[104:13.49]Hey, what's up, dude?
[104:16.11]I'm just calling again.
[104:17.29]I, um... I don't know if I... I guess you didn't get back to me from my last message, but I, um... I'm really getting fucking irritated at, like, the streaming thing.
[104:26.89]And, specifically, I don't know if you've ever played it before, but, like, for some stupid fucking reason, people love Mario Sunshine.
[104:33.49]It's, like, the worst Mario game.
[104:36.29]And...
[104:37.54]Like, I'm just playing it just to, like, appease everybody.
[104:39.76]Like, I don't even fucking want to play this stupid fucking game.
[104:43.58]But, I mean, I'm gonna, and I have to, because I started it, so... If you have any tips on, like, how to, like, make it... I can do, like, a 60-star thing or something.
[104:50.73]I know you played it a while ago.
[104:51.73]If not, just give me a call back whenever.
[104:53.07]Um, just call me whenever you feel like it.
[104:56.39]Preferably, like, uh... Yeah, you know the number.
[104:59.91]Just give me a call.
[105:01.27]And any tips on how to get to, like, all the shines as fast as possible to make it possible to...
[105:06.31]Cameron, we know you don't have friends.
[105:16.32]We know you don't have... oh yeah?
[105:17.56]Write those names down.
[105:19.46]They're getting subs.
[105:37.11]Kidding, I'm not gonna do that.
[105:40.41]Where am I going?
[105:41.19]Where do I go?
[105:41.77]Alright.
[105:47.81]A liar.
[105:48.39]Yes, that was a lie.
[105:49.40]I'm not gonna get like a fucking thousand subs right now.
[105:52.80]Should I go up this?
[105:54.12]What was the goal again?
[105:56.42]The goal?
[105:58.00]The secret of Rico's power.
[106:09.41]Wait, get that back.
[106:13.27]Helipad?
[106:13.73]Stag me when Jerma lies.
[106:23.02]Holy shit, I can jump on this?
[106:24.92]Okay, that... I was not... That's not a springboard.
[106:27.42]That's a valve.
[106:28.71]That's misleading.
[106:29.65]Oh, I got it!
[106:42.00]Alright, let's go!
[106:48.15]Grab the top of that.
[106:55.64]Can I punch through here?
[106:58.22]Oh shit, how do I... How do I, uh, punch through?
[107:01.28]How do I flip this bee?
[107:05.84]It's gonna be... Can I not punch that?
[107:11.62]Oh, I'm gonna do shit now.
[107:16.54]I'm gonna change this to... There we go.
[107:25.84]So, how do I do it?
[107:36.62]Hey chat, what's the best Diablo II character to start with?
[107:38.38]Uh, Sorceress.
[107:40.35]Lightning, Sorceress, you'll kill everything.
[107:41.75]No matter what.
[107:42.37]A?
[107:42.47]It's A. Okay, so we need to go over there, right?
[107:53.67]I'm just gonna go this way.
[107:57.75]Can I make this jump?
[107:59.69]Should I jump from there to there?
[108:06.14]That's not the tower.
[108:06.96]What is this tower?
[108:08.44]Over there?
[108:08.92]That's a tower.
[108:10.30]Oh!
[108:16.89]Coin!
[108:18.33]The game music is really loud.
[108:20.83]Is it?
[108:40.71]A little bit.
[108:42.18]How can I change that?
[108:48.36]Another shortcut.
[108:51.46]It's perfect now.
[108:55.27]Game music's kind of quiet when you turn it up.
[109:17.37]Imagine if I had a Patreon that had like a five thousand dollar tier Where you like I like flew you out to come like meet me like they all do
[109:28.69]So the reason why I say that is because I was about to just say, $5,000 Patreon tier, fly that guy out in like Patreon tier.
[109:37.18]Like I was making like a joke about that, but I had to make that, I had to tell you about that first so you know that it's not real and it's a joke.
[109:43.75]So I gotta make sure I explain that completely before I say it.
[109:48.11]Kickstarter donation tier, yeah.
[109:55.58]No, that's fine.
[109:56.86]I'll take the -2 because I am not going to say that out loud without giving a huge stupid explanation for it.
[110:06.72]No way.
[110:07.08]Like, oh, give that guy a sub!
[110:09.08]That's a joke, right?
[110:09.60]That's easy.
[110:10.10]Like, $10,000 Kickstarter tier that guy is like, I can't even make that joke.
[110:14.00]I'm not going to make that joke.
[110:30.35]Alright, I'm gonna get to the... over there.
[110:31.63]Oh, look, honey!
[110:34.15]Well, you did.
[110:34.75]No, I didn't.
[110:35.25]I explained what would happen if I did make the joke.
[110:37.05]It's different.
[110:41.92]Ooh!
[110:43.56]Pull it up, pull it up, Mario.
[110:44.58]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!
[110:45.96]Got it.
[110:52.40]No, no, no!
[110:53.56]Panic jump!
[110:57.15]Fuck.
[111:00.60]He's taking the coin.
[111:02.36]There's a coin in here, too.
[111:04.96]Wait, why is it... What's going on?
[111:19.79]Oh, I thought that was just a... I thought... Oh, it's not just a refill.
[111:23.15]It switches to... Oh.
[111:26.69]Shit.
[111:27.29]Okay.
[111:28.77]I thought it was just like a... Oh.
[111:30.93]Alright, that makes sense.
[111:33.07]No, it makes sense.
[111:33.59]It makes sense.
[111:34.01]I'll go get it.
[111:34.45]It's fine.
[111:43.97]I've never even hit jump in this game.
[111:45.83]Until two hours ago.
[111:46.93]Come on.
[111:52.08]Alright, I gotta do this bit over there.
[111:58.66]This is fucking exhausting, man.
[112:00.64]That wasn't good enough.
[112:04.34]Gotta be like this.
[112:22.13]I can't see.
[112:23.31]Alright, now let's get the heck out of here.
[112:47.11]This guy sucks.
[112:47.53]Does anybody know what his brother's channel is?
[112:52.61]That's my brother.
[112:55.24]What's he up to now?
[112:56.64]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[112:58.02]Hey, we got a big group of people coming in.
[113:00.84]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[113:01.86]What's up?
[113:03.12]What's Jeremy up to?
[113:04.22]Oh, he can't jump?
[113:05.28]Oh, I'll handle this.
[113:06.14]Oh, shoot.
[113:07.36]He comes in and he's like, hey, punch his... Hey, give me the controller for a second.
[113:10.88]Right, guys?
[113:13.15]Alright.
[113:13.61]Alright, bro.
[113:14.23]I take it, man.
[113:14.71]I think that's a first try.
[113:16.54]And he just like pats me in the back like, yeah, there you go, buddy.
[113:22.22]Hey, raid my channel.
[113:23.46]And I'm like, yeah.
[113:28.54]I earned this.
[113:29.46]And that's like the last thing he hears before I scream and he closes the door.
[113:32.15]Alright, I got it again.
[113:47.44]Now just, it's simple.
[113:48.38]You just have to jump like this.
[113:49.54]Simple.
[113:59.52]It's wicked easy!
[114:03.86]It's wicked easy!
[114:25.21]Come on, I don't have much water Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[114:28.99]Sorry Where, uh... What do I do from here?
[114:51.12]Like, okay, you know, like the, oh, this is a neighborhood.
[114:54.60]Slow down, dickhead.
[114:55.68]Right?
[114:56.18]They're not going to hear you.
[115:00.46]If you scream at a car that's, like, going by, boy, they're going to hear you scream.
[115:05.58]This is what they're going to hear.
[115:10.81]That's it.
[115:11.31]Not even.
[115:11.59]It'll be like, what?
[115:16.97]What do I go from here?
[115:20.48]I'm on the tower.
[115:21.44]Yeah.
[115:21.92]So, now what?
[115:22.80]Smash it?
[115:25.52]Throw in the hole?
[115:27.58]Oh!
[115:27.82]The... I see what you're saying.
[115:29.15]I... I don't have enough water to do this part.
[115:43.92]Sorry, just... Should I do it with oil?
[115:59.71]Oh my god.
[116:00.45]Don't drink the oil, Mario.
[116:01.80]Alright, alright, I gotta focus.
[116:03.50]No more fucking around.
[116:04.30]No more people speeding by my house, driving as fast as they fucking can, dangerously.
[116:09.05]What an asshole.
[116:10.21]But, like, alright, let's keep going.
[116:38.11]It's actually kind of hard.
[116:40.87]It's actually kind of hard.
[116:42.09]By the way, I haven't played a... Listen, listen to me.
[116:44.59]Everyone relax, relax, relax.
[116:46.11]I know everyone's going to freak the fuck out right now, but you have to remember something.
[116:48.79]Very important.
[116:49.67]Before everyone starts throwing rocks at me.
[116:52.29]Listen.
[116:53.75]I haven't played a fucking Mario game in 15 years.
[116:57.97]At least.
[116:58.69]I'm telling you the truth.
[116:59.69]What is this?
[117:07.48]Oh, this looks easy.
[117:09.32]Get the Rugrats remix.
[117:24.01]Where's the biyaku?
[117:27.01]There's no biyaku in this one?
[117:51.08]Holy shit in my fucking diaper.
[118:22.17]Oh, we're gonna be here a while, I think.
[118:24.97]Can I just walk over it?
[118:28.12]No, that's a bad idea.
[118:42.34]Ah!
[119:15.85]You fucking gotta be kidding me.
[119:23.97]What?
[119:24.15]How did I miss that?
[119:26.69]What?
[119:29.17]That was just so off, apparently?
[119:34.66]The shadow didn't show up.
[119:36.16]Listen to your fucking mother, god damn it.
[119:38.42]Itchy fucking whole body.
[119:40.51]My whole body's itching.
[119:41.91]Alright, I'm good.
[119:49.75]I'm sad that there's no Byahu.
[119:52.63]I would be so much better with the Byahu.
[120:01.12]Thankfully I can do this as many times as I possibly can do.
[120:04.14]Yeah, I can do this an infinite amount of times.
[120:07.90]That's a lot of greed right there.
[120:28.46]Oh my god!
[120:31.77]Oh my god!
[120:32.55]Oh!
[120:44.43]Shit, that gets hard at the end.
[120:52.50]Jumping diagonally over there and it gets a little tricky.
[120:54.84]Okay, let's go.
[121:01.92]Real voice.
[121:04.57]Real voice.
[121:07.37]Oh my god.
[121:09.43]Excuse me.
[121:10.03]I mean, hey, what's going on everybody?
[121:11.19]I'm a black retriever.
[121:12.75]Hey.
[121:15.02]Oh, dear.
[121:15.58]Oh, boy.
[121:17.62]Oh, crap.
[121:24.30]What is... Wait, they move!
[121:25.79]They move.
[121:26.37]That's what's going on.
[121:27.43]That's the problem.
[121:28.21]I figured it out.
[121:28.99]They move.
[121:30.05]They're moving.
[121:31.19]Oh, shit.
[121:35.74]They're moving back and forth, not just spinning.
[121:39.58]Oh my goodness.
[121:42.00]Oh man.
[121:42.72]I have to try a new strategy this time.
[121:46.46]You know what?
[121:46.84]Let me tell you.
[121:47.28]I'm fucking exhausted.
[121:50.81]This is the last message I'm going to leave.
[121:53.41]I'm not exhausted right now.
[121:56.27]I'm so tired.
[121:57.19]I'm just pretending every day.
[122:00.74]Call me back, dude, and just give me the secrets to beat Super Mario Sunshine in 40 stars or less.
[122:06.59]Okay.
[122:07.17]Alright, we'll go to that new lunch spot soon.
[122:10.21]Okay, bye.
[122:25.79]He just dropped on his own.
[122:27.45]Shit.
[122:29.89]I'm telling you, he dropped on his own.
[122:31.77]Something going on with the way the game's emulated on the fucking GameCube 2 Wii.
[122:36.23]I swear to God, I'm not even mad.
[122:38.31]This is fun.
[122:39.71]This is what happens when you play Mario.
[122:42.95]Okay, I didn't want to do the weird jump.
[122:44.63]Okay, let's just settle down a little bit and like... This is original hardware.
[122:56.06]I'm not even angry tilted.
[122:57.52]I'm like comedy tilted.
[122:59.28]This is funny.
[123:00.00]This is making me laugh, not even making me mad.
[123:14.59]Alright, if I don't get it right now, then I am gonna give 40 or 50 dollars towards when me and my friend go to get lunch at that new lunch spot.
[123:27.61]Like, I'll pay.
[123:43.28]Bad greed, but it's alright.
[123:50.99]Oh my god, I fucked it up.
[123:52.19]It's okay.
[123:52.55]No, I didn't.
[123:52.99]I'm good.
[123:53.31]Calm down.
[123:53.83]Relax.
[124:05.77]Oh my god, it's gonna make me fuckin' puke.
[124:08.07]It's gonna make me fuckin' puke.
[124:09.47]Um... Where'd I go from here?
[124:11.29]Over?
[124:11.83]Where?
[124:12.09]Over there?
[124:32.88]That seems so far away!
[124:33.90]That almost was really bad.
[124:37.14]Dude, you styled into it.
[124:45.25]Friend pays for lunch.
[124:48.77]Oh, nice!
[125:11.14]Hey, he's not even watching.
[125:12.06]Hey, dude, yeah, you wanna check out that new lunch spot?
[125:17.40]Yeah, yeah, we're gonna check that out.
[125:19.89]Oh, mmm.
[125:20.17]Mmm.
[125:20.73]Oh my god, that was delicious.
[125:22.07]Yeah, thanks for paying.
[125:24.57]Wait, what?
[125:26.07]Wait, you weren't watching?
[125:26.99]I beat that, like, secret level in Mario Sunshine.
[125:30.85]And I bet that you would be paying.
[125:33.65]But you bet... Well, that's fucking hilarious, dude.
[125:37.95]But, uh... You took me here.
[125:43.99]I'm going back here.
[125:44.61]Dude.
[125:47.15]What do you mean, dude?
[125:51.77]This one is the Hillside Cave Secret.
[125:54.26]This is another secret level.
[125:57.00]But Larry.
[125:57.78]Finish the joke.
[126:01.16]There is no finish the joke.
[126:02.20]What are you talking about?
[126:08.33]The joke is that was a prequel to me calling him five times and leaving a voicemail.
[126:18.92]What's the punchline?
[126:19.70]What punchline?
[126:24.83]It wasn't a joke, was it?
[126:26.01]I don't remember.
[126:26.49]Was I making a joke?
[126:27.59]Not really.
[126:32.33]Finally!
[126:32.87]Oh, I got to hear it!
[126:33.93]It's been... Come on!
[126:35.23]That's what I was looking for!
[126:36.28]It's in the game.
[126:37.94]It's just recycled audio.
[126:44.46]There it is.
[126:45.66]Yeah.
[126:45.98]Alright.
[126:46.62]So now we want to go.
[126:47.68]What's over there?
[126:51.98]Make a joke or I'm going to unsub.
[126:55.36]Write that guy's name down.
[126:56.16]He's not.
[126:56.50]He's not.
[126:56.78]You think you're going to unsub?
[126:58.41]Oh, that's funny.
[127:01.25]Not on my watch.
[127:01.95]I'll make sure you stay subbed.
[127:03.57]What's that guy's name?
[127:16.86]I subbed that guy forever, like I do.
[127:20.50]So he can't unsub.
[127:21.84]Should I do the thing?
[127:31.20]What is it?
[127:31.52]It's not really that big of a deal.
[127:39.68]I mean, I just murdered that motherfucker, but...
[127:50.66]Yeah, that's how you do this, right?
[127:52.22]Is that it?
[127:59.22]How am I not hitting these?
[128:14.51]Don't jump?
[128:23.12]Oh shit, my guy.
[128:24.22]I thought he had me.
[128:25.08]Give us a wink?
[128:29.03]I got it.
[128:29.97]I'm going the right way, right?
[128:46.35]Always listen to your brother.
[128:48.16]Watch the shadow.
[128:49.54]Don't even watch anything else where you're going.
[128:51.12]Just watch the shadow.
[128:52.14]So this is not even correct.
[128:53.32]Can I still get it from here if I do a big one?
[129:07.66]Don't jump!
[129:08.12]The panic jumped again!
[129:10.36]See?
[129:10.94]Everybody knows.
[129:11.52]Everybody knows what I'm talking about.
[129:12.73]I was there, and I was like, No, I'm not there!
[129:14.69]I'm not there!
[129:21.44]Why does he always stare at the camera with an angry face?
[130:02.80]I'm actually... I have a criticism of this game.
[130:06.14]Where's the Biahu?
[130:06.90]They took it out.
[130:07.50]That's like the most favorite move ever.
[130:13.19]Do something funny or I'm un-VIPing.
[130:15.01]Nope.
[130:16.29]I make the VIP list.
[130:21.67]You don't go to like an exclusive club and say to the bouncer, Hey, I'm VIP, but take me off the VIP list.
[130:27.97]Nope.
[130:29.75]Okay, the game is out to get me.
[130:34.56]The bombs are gonna be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[130:37.52]Alright, here we go.
[130:45.27]There's another secret level?
[130:51.49]Oh no, it's one of these!
[130:53.75]They're all like this, huh?
[130:55.13]Holy shit, this looks horrible.
[130:56.85]Actually, this doesn't even look that bad.
[130:58.82]First try.
[131:09.56]Where is he?
[131:11.41]Where is he?
[131:12.05]Okay.
[131:12.93]Oh, this ain't even that bad.
[131:18.69]This is weird.
[131:19.43]Okay, it is kind of bad.
[131:20.69]Was I going under?
[131:21.47]I thought I was going under.
[131:22.37]Um...
[131:47.43]that one wasn't bad at all you can make that one harder if you try to jump on the top of the things the other one was way more difficult probably because it's a harder level didn't get the one up yeah that's less important than redoing the mission like three times
[132:21.53]Yeah, that was like level one or two.
[132:24.33]So is that it?
[132:25.37]Are there three per stage?
[132:30.14]Is it three, four, five?
[132:33.48]Ooh.
[132:35.74]Red coins of Windmill Village.
[132:40.22]Is it eight?
[132:42.24]Oh, man.
[132:44.28]Eight shines.
[132:44.88]You need to do the first seven.
[132:46.16]I see.
[132:46.32]Oh, here's the red coins.
[132:49.81]They stole this from Yoshi's Island.
[132:53.38]Alright, where they at?
[133:08.13]One, two, three, four.
[133:10.95]Self-plagiarism.
[133:12.81]Ah, there's one right there.
[133:14.57]Any back here?
[133:17.48]I stole Mario from Yoshi's Island.
[133:20.26]See, you get it.
[133:22.56]If only more people could get it like you.
[133:39.47]Sub them.
[133:39.91]Wait, they're not subbed?
[133:41.59]Hard to know.
[133:47.12]What just, what's happened to me?
[133:48.34]I'm, oh, I wasn't even looking.
[133:49.54]Okay, there's four.
[134:04.47]Uh... One over... I can't see any.
[134:12.07]Just checking the perimeter.
[134:12.97]What about this way?
[134:14.79]I see one over there.
[134:28.64]Okay, who is a blue coin to blue cone
[135:02.29]Okay, there's another one right here.
[135:05.29]Go, Grandpa, go.
[135:06.35]Go, Grandpa, go.
[135:07.55]Two blue coins?
[135:09.13]Holy shit.
[135:14.30]How many does that make it?
[135:15.22]Two, twelve, fifteen coins?
[135:20.12]I think I need, I need sixteen coins and then I can move on from here.
[135:36.26]Finally, there's the money, there's the money, there's the money!
[135:47.10]Five community subs just came in from Raddest Raccoon.
[135:49.90]Didn't we also have a ton more money somewhere?
[135:53.24]Am I making that up?
[135:53.94]I made it up.
[135:56.50]Thanks, Raddus Raccoon for the $500.
[135:57.58]Welcome back.
[135:59.34]I hope you got one.
[136:01.68]I think I can think much better when I'm alone.
[136:03.84]I used to go to the hillside cave for a good think.
[136:06.84]Now it's just too scary.
[136:09.33]Well, if you had gone in there, you would have got the fucking thing that's worth like at least $80,000 United States dollars.
[136:16.01]One of those shines, but I got it.
[136:17.45]It's mine.
[136:19.19]Oh, that's cool.
[136:32.10]Alright, first impressions of Mario Sunshine.
[136:37.02]You ready?
[136:37.40]Can I give you my first impressions?
[136:42.59]You want them?
[136:45.17]It's been two... Alright, it's been almost two and a half hours.
[136:47.49]Okay.
[136:49.23]Um... That was horrible.
[136:55.51]Okay, this is horrible.
[136:56.43]This is...
[137:00.16]Uh, it's very good.
[137:02.12]It's very good I hmm
[137:20.54]We'll see.
[137:21.76]We'll see.
[137:23.10]I need three more red coins.
[137:32.25]We'll see.
[137:36.55]I played Mario Galaxy when it came out, and it was like, wow, this is...
[137:48.46]That's the last Mario game that I actually, like, played all the way through.
[137:58.51]So... Hmm.
[138:02.35]It's going to be a question whether or not I think this is better than Mario Galaxy.
[138:05.93]It's going to take a little while.
[138:12.32]Where's the last free point?
[138:13.82]Okay.
[138:19.76]it is it's not it's not well that's for me to decide remember what I say becomes a fact that's how it worked holy I didn't know you could do that wait where did that even go
[138:48.12]And remember, you have to think one's better than the other.
[138:53.39]There is no like, oh, I just like video games.
[138:55.31]I like them both.
[138:55.85]No, no, no, no, no.
[138:56.75]You have to say this one's better than that one.
[139:05.05]Where'd that other coin go?
[139:08.06]Where'd that blue coin come out from?
[139:14.70]what is it oh my god ring those bells hold on give me that water oh you're gonna find the axe okay
[139:42.27]Yeah, you can't just like them all.
[139:43.77]They're not doing it?
[139:58.22]Duh.
[140:01.48]You're a centrist.
[140:06.34]That doesn't make any sense!
[140:09.36]Because they're all Mario games!
[140:14.25]No, a true centrist position would say that I think Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog games are equally as good, and there's not one better than the other.
[140:22.04]That's me being, that's a centrist.
[140:24.68]All Mario games.
[140:40.01]Where are these last two coins?
[140:41.17]I gotta go, hold on.
[140:47.45]I need to get a good view.
[140:49.89]How do you switch to camera mode?
[140:52.99]Where's camera mode?
[140:56.92]I had it before, how do I do it?
[141:00.54]It's Y, okay.
[141:02.68]Okay, here we go.
[141:08.54]Well, there's not one over here.
[141:11.23]I'm gonna go that way.
[141:12.43]Yeah, I guess.
[141:20.58]What about over here?
[141:21.12]Anything over here?
[141:28.35]Ooh, this... I thought those were bananas.
[141:32.39]Why the heck is it on one of these coins, man?
[141:34.45]They're all in that village.
[141:45.24]Oh, shit!
[141:53.53]This is the X, but where's the... Oh, this is the X. Okay, let's get it.
[142:10.07]Alright, now it goes that side.
[142:11.77]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[142:14.25]Okay.
[142:15.19]Sure.
[142:15.73]I mean, I think it's bullshit, but whatever.
[142:26.01]God damn it.
[142:29.89]Alright, get in there.
[142:32.77]Too slow.
[142:33.93]What the fuck?
[142:40.14]No, Jeremy!
[142:41.64]Yeah, just do it again.
[142:42.80]Just do it again.
[142:43.32]These guys are just pissing me off.
[142:45.30]These guys are just pissing me off.
[142:49.13]You gotta go up around quickly.
[142:50.53]These guys are just being annoying.
[142:52.33]Fucking Binding of Isaac.
[142:58.05]Okay.
[143:07.26]Fifty dollars!
[143:11.48]We had, oh, we had, whoa, we had some big bits, and then we had five community subs.
[143:17.18]Back to back right there.
[143:18.18]Five subs.
[143:18.64]Thank you for the five subs.
[143:20.67]From JermaSucks.
[143:25.55]Thank you.
[143:27.33]And then, we also had... 5,000 bits.
[143:31.33]5,000 bits.
[143:35.31]From SuperGuppie.
[143:39.01]Thank you, SuperGuppie, for the 50 fucking dollars.
[143:44.08]And your message says, Hey, Jerma!
[143:45.50]It's been a while since I donated.
[143:47.76]Just want to tell you how much I appreciate everything you do.
[143:50.28]And I'm going to be missing these streams while I'm deployed.
[143:52.38]I was wondering if you had any plans to play the Battle for Bikini Bottom rehydrated whenever that comes out.
[143:59.06]Yeah, they're remaking this shit, aren't they?
[144:02.16]Yes, definitely.
[144:04.78]What is it going to be on?
[144:09.47]What platform is that going to be on?
[144:11.07]Everything?
[144:13.72]Just everything, okay?
[144:15.36]If I could do it on PC.
[144:16.10]Yeah, I'll definitely play it.
[144:19.06]Is it going to be on stream?
[144:21.90]Yeah, why not?
[144:24.97]If not, that's cool, but we're definitely doing it.
[144:27.23]I was going to get it for the old consoles, but why would I do that when I can play the new one?
[144:33.00]I appreciate everything you do and all the laughs you give my girlfriend and I. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being you, hands down the best streamer and the only one I watch.
[144:43.15]That means a fucking lot.
[144:47.65]I wish you the best of luck.
[144:49.33]Good luck with your deployment.
[144:52.73]Thank you so much for watching.
[144:54.59]And that means a fucking lot.
[144:55.63]That's a really, really nice fucking thing to say.
[144:59.84]Thanks for the $50, dude.
[145:11.23]You're the only streamer I watch.
[145:14.91]That's... Well, that's really... That's good, because if you watch anybody else, you'll see how shitty this stream actually is.
[145:24.34]Don't watch anybody else ever.
[145:25.36]Don't ever click on another stream, because then you'll see how bad these streams are.
[145:34.56]I'm kidding.
[145:35.22]We got the best of the business here.
[145:37.55]You know what you don't think?
[145:38.19]Come on.
[145:38.53]I gotta give myself a little bit of fucking credit where it's due.
[145:41.39]This is the best in the business.
[145:42.47]Right here.
[145:50.50]Where's this last coin?
[145:52.52]Egomaniac.
[145:55.26]Oh, yeah.
[145:55.84]Egomaniac?
[145:56.46]I'll be leaving a voicemail on one of my friend's fucking phones later about that one.
[146:00.29]You better believe it.
[146:07.46]I'm almost out of water, but I don't need that.
[146:08.62]Get there!
[146:10.90]Oh!
[146:34.01]I gotta get that coin.
[146:34.97]I don't even know what the hell these things do.
[146:36.74]I have no idea what these do.
[146:40.98]All I know is that I want them.
[146:42.04]I don't even know what they do.
[146:44.82]They're just blue.
[146:46.36]And that's enough for me.
[146:50.91]Hold on.
[146:52.03]What?
[146:58.37]Well.
[146:59.95]Isn't that interesting.
[147:06.60]Cool.
[147:07.06]Alright.
[147:13.00]I see a blue coin over there.
[147:13.86]I don't even need that.
[147:19.19]Do it from here.
[147:21.59]And there's a last red coin.
[147:24.51]Oh, isn't that cute?
[147:25.67]Oh, that's wrong!
[147:27.75]I know what that is.
[147:28.97]Brennan Stimpy.
[147:30.45]Write that person's name down.
[147:43.43]Oh, yeah, yeah, two stupid dogs.
[147:44.67]Yeah, sorry, that's incorrect.
[147:45.92]Oh, it wasn't that cute, but it was wrong.
[147:50.12]It was.
[148:06.80]Fucking idiot, stupid, fucking idiot, dumb, fucking idiot, fucking dumbass, fucking idiot.
[148:11.44]Yeah, I know.
[148:12.04]I deserve that.
[148:13.72]I want that.
[148:14.84]How do I get that from here?
[148:15.80]I need a super spring?
[148:17.46]Sounds like I can get it from here.
[148:29.33]No, I can't get it from here.
[148:31.55]Get the stuff.
[148:33.11]Up.
[148:33.55]Go up, Mario.
[148:34.13]Come on.
[148:39.62]Go up and get the stuff.
[148:58.82]I fucking knew that was gonna happen too.
[149:00.73]Like I could see it from a mile away.
[149:01.99]I just... I'm gonna run out of water.
[149:06.45]He sucks.
[149:07.03]Stop saying that.
[149:09.47]Don't fucking say that.
[149:14.56]He sucks.
[149:14.94]He sucks.
[149:15.28]He sucks.
[149:15.62]He sucks.
[149:15.94]He sucks.
[149:16.30]He sucks.
[149:16.64]He sucks.
[149:17.26]Don't fucking say that fucking thing.
[149:26.35]Stop pretending.
[149:26.95]I just don't fucking say that anymore.
[149:29.17]Alright, I have to focus.
[149:30.74]I'm not focusing.
[149:31.48]That's the problem.
[149:33.28]What happened there, Mario64?
[149:34.30]Wannabe.
[149:56.70]He really does hate this game.
[149:57.96]No, actually, I don't.
[149:58.72]I actually really like it.
[150:03.00]I enjoy... I enjoy this streamer.
[150:04.26]Is he a cool dude?
[150:08.78]Up to you.
[150:09.58]Make that decision.
[150:10.18]I can't make it for you.
[150:13.38]Tag me when he lies.
[150:14.32]Tag me when he lies.
[150:15.18]Why... What did I do?
[150:16.79]Why... I don't get it.
[150:17.63]Um... Alright, I'm gonna... I'm gonna see.
[150:24.49]Let's check this one again.
[150:25.37]Okay.
[150:32.26]Lady Piranha strikes back!
[150:34.17]What does this mean?
[150:40.07]Lady Piranha strikes back?
[150:42.89]He's all the way over here on a little island.
[150:46.83]This one is awful.
[150:56.75]Why?
[150:57.25]Let's take a look.
[151:01.17]This one sucks.
[151:02.19]Okay, well... Let's find out why.
[151:11.72]I'll go over here.
[151:26.24]No, not over here.
[151:27.22]Other side?
[151:34.22]Slurp the chocolate off the ground.
[151:37.71]Yeah, I just think of Willy Wonka whenever I see this stuff.
[151:42.15]Where is he?
[151:49.13]Get a good view.
[152:01.97]Ow!
[152:02.39]God!
[152:04.75]That's not how you work that, Mario.
[152:10.10]How many times have you guys ever car-doored yourself in the face?
[152:14.42]Raise your fucking hand.
[152:15.92]Raise your hand.
[152:16.70]I know you.
[152:17.40]I've done it a bunch of times.
[152:20.11]How many times have you ever closed your car door and, like, it hits you right in the chin?
[152:25.39]It's happened at least once or twice to all of you.
[152:27.15]I know it has.
[152:33.41]It looks like we've got a lot of liars in here.
[152:36.38]Tag chat.
[152:38.18]Tag that person when chat lies.
[152:43.24]Where is he?
[152:43.72]That's embarrassing.
[152:55.02]So you're telling me that you've never had, like, a bag of groceries in your hands, and, like, you've closed your car door with your hip, and you, like, scraped the top of your head with the door somehow, or, like, the bottom of the door.
[153:06.85]You've never done that before.
[153:10.11]Not even one time.
[153:10.89]This doesn't happen every day.
[153:22.71]It's happened maybe three times in my whole life.
[153:26.12]But it's definitely happened more than once.
[153:29.56]How do you do that?
[153:30.20]Because you use your elbow and hip and you go too hard and you hit the back of your head or the top of your head.
[153:37.90]It happens.
[153:40.38]Or like your chin or your neck.
[153:42.56]Not the top of your head.
[153:43.40]No, I know where this is going and I'm going to stop it right now.
[153:47.82]I'm talking about...
[153:50.47]Where's PD Piranha 2?
[153:51.49]There?
[153:51.87]I'm gonna get the rocket.
[153:54.18]Can I get the rocket through this?
[154:24.54]clown car door.
[154:38.25]Mario!
[154:40.33]Alright, this is, that's too strong.
[154:41.83]Dude, that's fucking high.
[154:47.79]You know what I mean?
[154:48.55]Like, I can even fucking do that.
[154:51.59]Your brother coming in and doing it for you.
[155:05.63]over there I have no idea where he is you saw it before yeah but I am I going right away I go I'm going up there
[155:32.45]Am I dumping my pants?
[155:37.03]What am I doing?
[155:39.42]Oh!
[156:06.48]Alright.
[156:09.63]Let's see.
[156:11.87]Let's go up here.
[156:13.07]Off camera.
[156:14.51]No.
[156:31.80]Wrong way! Wrong way! Wrong way! Wrong way! Wrong way! Wrong way! Wrong way! Wrong way!
[156:43.11]Plete- complete wrong side of the map.
[156:49.11]What is this? What do you want?
[156:51.11]Hey it's that big headed this from that windmill. It's back!
[157:02.43]How do you see this and not me?
[157:05.85]Wrong way.
[157:06.53]Complete wrong way.
[157:08.03]So I have to go this way?
[157:12.95]Just go to the sludge.
[157:16.52]Wrong way.
[157:17.62]Wrong way.
[157:18.42]Alright, here's the sludge.
[157:25.38]Wasn't he- he was on like a little island.
[157:33.00]wrong wrong it's not over there is it over here wrong wrong somebody tell this guy's going the wrong way go to the cliff wrong
[158:02.66]He's on the cliff.
[158:05.36]I mean, we're surrounded by cliffs.
[158:11.57]Up there?
[158:11.95]Is he up there?
[158:13.35]Is he up there?
[158:15.17]He's up there?
[158:17.21]Is he up there?
[158:18.57]Wrong.
[158:20.37]Wrong way.
[158:28.15]Yes, yeah, I thought he was like down in the... Alright, let me see.
[158:35.05]Alright, is he up there?
[158:38.05]Okay.
[158:41.25]Oh, well, come on!
[158:43.39]I... I... The zoomed out, I didn't know you were... Alright, now what do I do?
[159:00.79]big arc I'm just jumping on his head
[159:30.99]Well, I know where it is.
[159:32.01]Let's go.
[159:35.21]You think when Mario falls out like that and all the toads are over there, you think he just shakes it off or you think he's just like, don't fucking look at me, man.
[159:43.55]Did they know that I failed?
[159:45.45]If I fall back out of that painting on my back, isn't it like, holy shit, is he alright?
[159:50.31]Should we talk to him?
[159:51.99]Or is it just like, don't fucking talk to me.
[159:54.46]I'm going back in.
[159:56.68]Don't even look over here.
[160:00.87]I wonder if it's like that.
[160:01.61]If it happens, like, three or four times in a row, do you think that one of the toads eventually would be like, Mario, do you need some help?
[160:11.55]Mario, do you want... Do you even bring it up?
[160:15.11]Dude, he found the slide.
[160:22.46]Hog.
[160:22.82]Alright, well, I need the rocket again.
[160:40.01]He found the slide, dude.
[160:41.16]Oh, play wow.
[160:42.66]Did somebody just write play wow in this?
[160:46.62]What?
[160:47.40]Why would I do that?
[160:49.22]Ever.
[160:49.80]Again.
[160:51.06]Mario, you alright?
[160:54.33]Dude, this thing doesn't even work.
[160:55.97]Malfunction.
[161:02.15]Karazhan.
[161:05.44]I remember Karazhan.
[161:15.92]Okay, so of those 6,000 people that are here right now, how many of you were around for the Karazhan era?
[161:29.00]Hey!
[161:29.16]These guys are just dying.
[161:36.06]Okay.
[162:06.76]Oh, he's coming over here.
[162:10.55]He's coming over here!
[162:12.47]No!
[162:13.93]Where's he going?
[162:29.82]Kick his ass Okay, why is he just flying around shoot him with a
[162:58.04]Alright, where is he?
[163:02.08]He's about to, like, go terrorize the town.
[163:04.33]How do I get more?
[163:15.27]I need more pigs to fire, don't I?
[163:29.26]Oh shit, he's on the ground.
[163:32.92]Oh, what the fuck?
[163:34.50]Can I stop?
[163:35.40]Is he on the ground permanently?
[163:49.97]Oh, I got hit by the pig.
[163:57.66]Um... Alright, watch out.
[163:59.67]Get out of the way.
[164:04.23]If I can just spray him, I don't need a pig.
[164:09.29]Spray him.
[164:17.19]Spray him.
[164:17.63]Spray him.
[164:18.11]Spray him.
[164:25.18]Where the fuck is this guy?
[164:30.86]Wrong way, wrong way, wrong way, wrong way, wrong way, wrong way.
[164:36.02]That's right.
[164:38.92]You're playing it wrong, give me the controller.
[164:51.97]Fine, dude, fuck, take it!
[164:53.03]Jesus, take it!
[164:58.52]You're doing pretty good.
[164:59.22]Alright, cool.
[165:00.04]So you're following his shadow.
[165:01.16]And just aiming straight up.
[165:06.78]Okay.
[165:07.26]You missed.
[165:10.00]You fucking missed.
[165:11.30]Now you have to chase him.
[165:15.17]It's hard to get the refill.
[165:16.37]Why'd you step in the mud?
[165:21.81]Oh, did you switch?
[165:23.05]Well, you accidentally switched to the other one?
[165:25.01]Why'd you do that?
[165:26.44]Why are you so bad at this?
[165:27.52]How have you not hit him yet?
[165:43.43]Oh, finally.
[165:44.33]Jesus.
[165:45.81]Open.
[165:49.80]Open!

[166:35.28]Hey, can I have the controller back now?
[166:38.54]No, no, I'll give it back.
[166:41.50]Give me the controller.
[166:42.49]Just give it to me, dude.
[166:43.31]Right here.
[166:45.13]Let go.
[166:46.27]Let fucking go of the- Just let it go!
[166:49.19]I wanna- Let me play.
[166:52.26]Let it go.
[166:53.92]Let it fu- Come on, dude.
[166:55.14]Don't-
[166:57.15]Fine, fine, fine.
[166:57.99]Alright, I'm done.
[166:58.73]I'm done, I'm done.
[167:00.11]I'll- I'll just be like... I'll just get it.
[167:02.74]Fucking idiot.
[167:03.62]You- I- Dad, never let your guard down.
[167:05.18]I gotta-
[167:27.24]Big bro never let you play.
[167:31.89]Don't you guys understand the little brother, big brother strategy?
[167:37.21]Oh, hey, you've been playing for like an hour and a half straight, big brother.
[167:40.81]I'm the little brother.
[167:42.77]Oh.
[167:43.53]Can I play?
[167:44.39]Yeah, after the next level.
[167:47.19]Oh, okay.
[167:49.64]Do you want something to drink?
[167:52.20]Yeah, actually, grab me a Coke.
[167:55.10]Sure thing, brother.
[167:57.11]You go get a coke, and you put it down right there.
[168:00.42]There it is.
[168:01.64]And that takes two hands.
[168:04.64]One, two, open tab.
[168:06.94]The controller is yours.
[168:09.28]Hey!
[168:10.20]What the?
[168:22.61]Or just mention going to the bathroom.
[168:26.34]You know, just make it, like, really obvious that you just were in the bathroom.
[168:28.81]And when people start to think about them being in a bathroom, like, oh, like, uh, yeah, sorry, I'll be right back.

[174:14.99]Rico Harper.
[174:16.19]Gooper Blooper Returns.
[174:21.60]Do another race?
[174:31.00]Oh, no.
[174:34.57]This is the other one.
[174:35.15]This is this thing.
[174:35.69]Okay.
[174:35.99]Alright.
[174:37.11]Gooper Blooper.
[174:41.21]I thought you... Yeah.
[174:42.03]You guys said this is a guy's name for Sid the Squid.
[174:47.06]This is bullshit.
[174:50.39]His name is Gooper Blooper.
[174:51.95]What do you mean no one said that?
[174:58.65]Why would I have said that for no reason?
[175:00.23]I wouldn't just randomly make up the guy's name.
[175:04.60]Sid the Squid.
[175:07.18]He made it up.
[175:09.32]Wait, I'm gonna be fine.
[175:18.76]I didn't make it up.
[175:20.12]I didn't make that up.
[175:20.98]No, I didn't.
[175:22.60]I did not make that up.
[175:24.33]Somebody else did.
[175:24.95]Alright, there's the squid.
[175:33.41]Is this part two?
[175:34.10]Just another fight?
[175:34.72]Alright, how much is the easy squid?
[175:40.80]Should I get the rocket?
[175:41.48]Probably the rocket, right?
[175:48.91]I guess not.
[175:49.31]I can just get up there from here.
[175:51.41]There's a jump right there.
[175:53.03]And now I know it's a fucking jump.
[175:55.67]Alright, here we go.
[175:59.30]Alright.
[176:21.31]What?
[176:25.44]You must find a way to fight it.
[176:27.00]This is the way to fight it.
[176:27.80]I'm gonna rip his face off.
[176:29.54]Are you kidding me?
[176:31.67]Are you kidding me?
[176:46.91]oh no phew losing to the easiest boss in the game I am I'm about to win right now now I win now you gotta get all cool
[177:16.25]You know how many old game facts threads about this guy exist?
[177:23.12]What?
[177:41.79]I'm having trouble.
[177:42.47]I can't beat the squid.
[177:43.97]I don't understand.
[177:44.84]I pulled the cork out and I'm spraying him.
[177:46.58]I don't know what to do.
[177:47.42]And then you get the one, like, just messed up keyboard typing response.
[177:58.67]The person's definitely like 13th.
[178:14.04]And that person knows everything.
[178:20.63]And it's funny because I do that shit all the time still.
[178:23.79]I actually write like that still.
[178:25.39]If you ever part of the pre-stream chats, you'd know that I do that all the time.
[178:30.63]I mess up half the words I type on a keyboard.
[178:37.27]I do incorrect punctuation, wrong capitals.
[178:40.17]Sometimes I capitalize a word in the middle of a sentence for no reason.
[178:42.73]I don't know why.
[178:43.19]It just feels right to do that way.
[178:53.25]I'm going over there.
[178:54.76]No, I'm doing this one again.
[178:57.30]Let's see a new area.
[178:58.18]We've been on the same areas for a while.
[178:59.42]I'm just like a weird completionist for no reason.
[179:05.80]New area.
[179:10.32]Let me take a look.
[179:11.04]Was Peach having anything to say?
[179:14.48]Oh, I'm getting that feeling again.
[179:15.56]This is not good.
[179:16.58]Has something bad happened again?
[179:17.96]It feels like it.
[179:18.98]Mario, please check it out for me.
[179:20.38]I've been fucking texting you this shit.
[179:28.70]Hey, Peach almost died from a squid.
[179:33.71]I've been in the hospital for three days.
[179:35.35]I fell off a cliff.
[179:36.87]What are you talking about?
[179:43.08]This was made in, like, 2004.
[179:44.16]And, wow.
[179:46.61]Unbelievable how a game from 2004 holds up better than a lot of games I've played in the last, you know, Jerma 2006 streamers.
[180:01.84]Here's a little experiment for those of you guys watching right now.
[180:04.30]The last game that I played on this stream that was made after 2011 or 2012.
[180:09.30]What was it?
[180:10.36]How long ago?
[180:11.80]Jump King?
[180:13.41]Okay.
[180:25.12]Sekiro?
[180:26.24]That was, no, I played, no, it hasn't, are you serious?
[180:29.65]That's like the last game I played after 2012.
[180:34.27]Outer Wilds is probably the last one.
[180:36.29]When did Outer Wilds come out?
[180:37.17]Like 2018, 2019?
[180:37.35]Red and Evil 2?
[180:38.15]Outer Wilds?
[180:43.40]Outer Wilds was like a few, a couple months ago.
[180:45.50]Yeah, that's, that's pretty accurate.
[180:58.03]Rain World?
[180:59.87]Yeah, I only played Rain World for like an hour, though.
[181:04.05]Oh, fuck.
[181:10.45]That guy has no Joker in him.
[181:16.17]Didn't float?
[181:18.21]Yeah, that's cool.
[181:20.55]Play it more?
[181:21.01]Alright, I'm gonna do that.
[181:27.37]We're on Mario Sunshine.
[181:35.66]Universal Paperclips?
[181:38.68]Yeah, that's true.
[181:40.37]I did beat that game.
[181:43.99]I mean, is that a game or is that an experiment?
[181:46.93]Are they the same thing?
[181:53.31]Alright, what's this place?
[182:01.96]Tell the shit stain story.
[182:07.50]What the fuck are you talking about?
[182:11.15]Dunebud Sand Castle Secret.
[182:18.51]Frog Detective.
[182:19.21]That's true.
[182:19.73]Yeah.
[182:20.53]We're not only a 2006 streamer.
[182:22.45]We're just mostly a 2006 streamer.
[182:30.72]This place is cool.
[182:35.32]Ooh, what's that?
[182:41.53]Triangle.
[182:44.01]Well, I don't know where that other triangle is, but...
[182:47.75]It ain't over here.
[182:48.54]It's gotta be close, though, right?
[182:50.22]This side?
[182:54.44]It's probably right up here.
[182:59.64]It's probably up...
[183:16.14]Nope.
[183:18.06]Variety Influencer?
[183:21.61]Where's that triangle?
[183:22.29]Right there?
[183:22.81]Come on, where is it?
[183:24.25]Right up.

[184:09.16]It's reflecting into the sun Okay
[184:16.85]Where's that triangle?
[184:18.80]It has to be close enough to get it before it despawns.
[184:20.44]I don't know.
[184:22.36]Whatever.
[184:22.62]Alright, we gotta find that flower that's here.
[184:25.22]Right here.
[184:30.82]Holy shit.
[184:31.68]What is that?
[184:36.20]Should I be standing on it?
[184:36.96]Does it, like, launch me?
[184:40.84]It does, but... Where do I go after that?
[184:50.61]What's this thing called?
[184:52.45]Doonbud Sandcastle Secret.
[184:54.73]Sandcastle?
[184:58.33]Are there more than one of these?
[185:00.95]There is.

[192:03.67]I wouldn't look again.
[192:04.45]Alright.
[192:04.91]Some weird thing has curled up on the tower to take a nap.
[192:08.07]This should endanger the legendary sand bird egg.

[204:36.33]Is it a turtle?
[204:40.84]Okay, is Bowser a turtle or is he a dinosaur?
[204:44.42]Which one?
[204:44.80]Okay.
[204:49.43]Obviously a combination of both.
[204:52.59]He's a turtle.
[204:58.71]He's a koopa.
[204:59.73]That's right, a made-up animal.
[205:01.62]So, I could say crab, I could say dinosaur, I could say turtle, and it'd all be accurate.
[205:05.72]Okay, Wiggler Ahoy, full steam ahead.
[205:15.75]A koopa is a made-up animal.
[205:17.37]A koopa.
[205:19.82]Oh, and now he's pissed.
[205:23.24]Yeah, when Charles Darwin was at the Galapagos, I don't remember him riding down Koopa.
[205:40.10]Get on.
[205:41.18]Oh, come on.
[205:41.90]Get up.
[205:42.74]Wait, what the fuck did I just do?
[205:44.32]Something?
[205:44.82]Oh, I know what to do now.
[205:46.04]I figured it out on my own.
[205:48.46]You gotta launch him.
[205:55.03]Go.
[205:57.21]Motor.
[205:57.53]Get him.
[205:59.81]Flip him.
[206:00.23]Flip him.
[206:00.49]Wow.
[206:00.83]What was that?
[206:06.29]Did you hear that crackling?
[206:09.78]Oh, he didn't turn.
[206:19.78]Oh, that crunching.
[206:22.28]Oh, the crunching's killing me.
[206:24.84]Oh!
[206:26.44]It's an emulator audio.
[206:40.41]Ow!
[206:41.82]Fucking crunchy-ass audio.
[206:46.06]It's not an emulator.
[206:47.32]I can show you the disc.
[206:48.46]It's in there.
[206:49.74]I'm laying it on a fucking Wii.
[207:25.61]Jesus Christ!
[207:34.25]Come here!
[207:38.71]Get this over with so I don't have to do this anymore.
[207:40.63]It's crushing me.
[207:42.66]It's like chewing sand.
[207:44.98]This one, this one, this one, this one, this one, this one.
[207:46.36]Over here.
[207:49.40]You must... You must stop rubbing your socks on the rug.
[208:01.71]Flip him!
[208:08.96]20 flip.
[208:10.24]Am I doing this wrong?
[208:11.26]Flip him!
[208:30.35]Flip him!
[208:30.63]Alright, get up there.
[208:33.95]Come on, yah, bah, bah, hoo!
[208:36.65]This is the last time! Last time!
[208:40.65]Alright. Why was that so loud?
[208:52.65]Dropping your socks on the ground on a dry ass day. That's so funny.
[209:13.81]What are you doing over here?
[209:15.29]What are you, a little, a little buddy bee?
[209:17.65]What?
[209:17.95]Don't come this way!
[209:43.20]He wants me to go over here.
[209:44.30]That's a fucking crab's face.
[209:46.61]That is not a turtle's face.
[209:48.03]That is very much a full... Like, the crab has that... That's a crab face.
[209:51.89]Might be a turtle animal, but it's a crab face with crab eyes.
[209:55.45]I will win that argument every time.
[209:56.66]You want me to take you to court?
[209:58.56]Would you like to go?
[210:08.61]A sandbird is born.
[210:12.81]Take me to Crab Court.
[210:15.73]Would it be Crab Court or Turtle Court?
[210:19.37]No, it would just be regular law.
[210:32.02]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[210:46.40]Okay, here's what's happening right now.
[210:58.71]This is something that's pretty interesting to think about.
[211:00.67]I am triggering an automatic response from a lot of people where they hate hearing somebody sing.
[211:10.10]It's an interesting phenomenon.
[211:13.68]You hate
[211:14.14]I hate hearing somebody, like, sing.
[211:16.44]It's like, ugh!
[211:17.94]Shut the fuck up.
[211:19.41]I don't know why it happens to some people.
[211:20.75]Alright, how do we get in there?
[211:34.12]Bounce?
[211:37.54]My friend is like that.
[211:45.15]Make it!
[211:46.43]Okay.
[211:47.97]Ooh, I can go that way.
[211:52.43]Alright, we're in.
[212:00.86]Sing more?
[212:01.40]Uh-huh.
[212:07.63]What the hell is this?
[212:09.11]This thing's Shadow of the Colossus.
[212:10.57]It's a legendary sandbird.
[212:13.55]It's climbing around the tower.
[212:14.71]Watch your feet.
[212:15.31]Alright, so what's this?
[212:19.84]Just get coins?
[212:23.28]Get eight coins.
[212:24.60]Easy.
[212:27.52]He's probably gonna...
[212:29.79]Alright, I was gonna say... I got hit by the cloud.
[212:34.67]You can get hit by clouds.
[212:36.87]Don't you pass through clouds?
[212:43.45]That's inaccurate.
[212:44.17]Clouds are not solid.
[213:10.93]Stop!
[213:14.90]Stop!
[213:22.52]Somebody stop him!
[213:47.23]That took... You know how hard that was to do?
[213:49.41]That was really hard to do that and get through the whole thing.
[213:53.53]Alright, where's the... I'm gonna go crab level.
[214:16.25]Alright, well, I'm just having fun.
[214:17.24]Where am I going?
[214:23.50]This is where I was... I want to try the level again.
[214:25.82]Let's do that one more time.
[214:30.43]You did that in two tries and you gave up?
[214:34.11]Well, I didn't give up.
[214:34.87]I was going to come back.
[214:42.15]Actually scary face.
[214:58.57]Yeah, I look like the fucking penguin.
[215:02.81]I look swollen.
[215:03.67]I don't look a little swollen?
[215:06.97]That's the... Yeah, that's the... I shit myself.
[215:17.03]Well, here's your... Alright, yeah, here's your, like, shit stain story.
[215:20.89]I was streaming, dude, and fucking holy shit, can you imagine?
[215:24.28]Playing Mario Sunshine.
[215:36.08]Something's in water today.
[215:37.70]You know what I mean?
[215:38.20]I think something's in the water today.
[215:40.99]What was it?
[215:41.67]What did I have to eat today?
[215:43.71]What happened today?
[215:44.59]Something's in the water, I think.
[215:45.73]I think there's something in there.
[216:03.34]It's the 5G.
[216:04.36]Oh, yeah.
[216:05.30]They did just put 5G in Vegas.
[216:06.68]You're right.
[216:07.04]Yeah.
[216:12.96]5G's in Vegas.
[216:17.13]I think they just turned it on, like, today.
[216:19.77]Did they?
[216:23.09]Hey, let's go, bird.
[216:32.98]Did he do the 5G gum joke again?
[216:34.75]Nah, I don't think so.
[216:37.43]Okay, let's make this... Holy fuck, the tail.
[216:52.34]It's gonna be horrible.
[216:53.12]Okay.
[217:02.42]Hey, hey, give me that!
[217:03.20]Uh, I don't know what it... Pop door!
[217:22.78]I have a glass breaking sound right at the end of that.
[217:34.93]It's like, yeah, it's a little weird.
[217:36.17]I'll get it right here.
[217:57.02]Where's, where's the last one?
[218:02.00]He's turning.
[218:02.46]Fuck, he's turning.
[218:04.84]Oh my god, he's turning!
[218:06.18]He's turning all the way!
[218:07.20]Jesus!
[218:09.68]What?
[218:12.02]God, he's flipping upside down!
[218:16.48]He's flipping upside down?
[218:25.26]Is the last coin on his backside?
[218:27.66]No.
[218:28.30]Where is it?
[218:30.42]I gotta go quickly.
[218:34.92]Oh!
[218:35.10]Oh!
[218:35.42]Okay.
[218:36.02]Now, tail.
[218:36.82]Now, work.
[219:21.02]Can I jump onto one of the platforms?
[219:23.82]I'm gonna jump on one of these.
[219:24.78]Well, let me get them all first.
[219:26.54]Let me get the hardest one first.
[219:27.46]Give me the tail.
[219:27.92]Give me this one.
[219:36.57]I don't like holding down on the controller.
[219:38.03]I like pressing up.
[219:45.92]Six, seven.
[219:50.77]Alright, now where the hell is this gonna- where we go?
[219:52.67]Where we going?
[219:53.11]I need to look.
[220:06.58]No, fuck!
[220:08.32]No, what?
[220:09.36]I'm trying to... ...grab onto, like, his ehh... like, stand on his... So I have to- while he's turning, I have to jump and then hover.
[220:21.84]Can I land on his back?
[220:23.46]Can I land on a cloud?
[220:25.58]Can he land on a cloud?
[220:28.10]The clouds disappear, though.
[220:42.33]Yeah, my plan was to try to stand on the top of his wing.
[220:47.68]But before I could jump, I just started sliding.
[221:08.49]Alright, let's go.
[221:09.65]Sandbird is born.
[221:16.10]Apologize to Toad?
[221:18.04]No.
[221:20.26]At this point, you get the fuck out of Mario's way.
[221:22.14]You see Mario jumping and flipping.
[221:24.65]Okay, if you went to a gymnastics competition, you know they have the floor?
[221:29.69]They do the floor routine?
[221:31.83]Are you gonna fucking stand on the floor?
[221:35.26]In front of, like, where they're going?
[221:37.16]No.
[221:37.44]Why would you do that?
[221:40.40]I have a good idea.
[221:41.34]The person's doing seven flips in a row and they're doing an insane floor routine.
[221:44.82]I'm gonna stand in their way.
[221:47.80]That's your fault at that point.
[221:49.31]I got another coin.
[221:50.17]Alright, I'm gonna try.
[221:57.55]This is my last... After this continue, I'm gonna move on to the next place.
[222:02.67]This is like too high.
[222:03.91]I don't like this shit right now.
[222:25.47]Next game?
[222:28.35]What?
[222:29.99]What?
[222:30.19]How?
[222:30.63]I only have 14 stars.
[222:32.56]Why would I... I'm not gonna... Quit Mario Sunshine?
[222:36.50]No, I'm not doing that.
[222:41.82]This game was $280.
[222:42.96]Oh, whoops.
[222:49.72]I needed to be on that.
[222:52.00]I fucked it up.
[223:05.21]We're good.
[223:09.50]That's a lie.
[223:11.27]I know it was.
[223:11.85]Of course it was.
[223:12.61]Of course it was a lie.
[223:15.37]It was like, I don't know, 40?
[223:18.39]30?
[223:18.41]20?
[223:22.95]Factory sealed.
[223:24.03]Imagine buying a factory sealed original untouched copy of Mario Sunshine and opening it.
[223:29.63]When you can just have one for like 10 bucks.
[223:31.61]Or like 20 bucks or something.
[223:32.97]Okay.
[223:42.13]Alright, let's do this.
[223:47.95]Not the tail.
[223:48.67]The head?
[223:49.09]Alright, we're going for the head?
[223:54.30]We're going for the wing.
[223:55.20]We're going for the wing.
[223:55.72]Which way is it gonna turn?
[223:56.44]Going for the head.
[223:57.46]We're going for the head.
[224:05.10]Fucking panic jumped again!
[224:07.74]Oh, I didn't... I had it!
[224:09.50]What the fuck?
[224:12.43]Oh, it was right there.
[224:13.39]I was like, jump again!
[224:14.58]Oh, god damn it.
[224:16.82]I want to, like, duct tape my fucking thumb.
[224:19.70]I want to make my thumb wicked heavy.
[224:22.92]No, no, no, reverse.
[224:23.78]I want to have, like, a Bowflex machine attached to my thumb, so I have to, like, press down to jump, and it's this resistance.
[224:36.24]Because then these little, like, oh, tap, tap, tap, oops.
[224:39.64]No, I want, I need resistance training.
[224:40.98]I need to have my thumb way fucking up in the air.
[224:44.88]So then you don't do panic jumps anymore.
[224:47.50]God damn it.
[224:48.30]That was it, too.
[224:56.37]Fuck.
[224:58.73]Alright, slow it down, slow it down.
[224:59.95]We're doing the head.
[225:00.41]We're doing the same place.
[225:04.31]Stop freaking out!
[225:05.01]He's shaking me!
[225:06.25]He's trying to shake me!
[225:13.80]Why even jump?
[225:14.68]Oh, now what?
[225:30.46]What?
[225:31.34]Why?
[225:32.38]Why that time?
[225:33.56]Did it not work?
[225:36.18]I walked over the first time, and I walked over the second time, and he fell off.
[225:44.67]If you fall off, you can't hover immediately.
[225:51.60]If I fall, if I slip the hover, I can't turn it on immediately.
[225:57.03]I had it that fucking first time.
[225:58.31]Stupid sand bird.
[226:02.98]Jump and hover?
[226:03.62]No, I can't.
[226:04.80]My thumb is weighed up right now.
[226:06.20]I can't do it.
[226:18.20]Okay, come on.
[226:20.36]What if I go from there?
[226:20.92]Do I just stay on him?
[226:25.04]Here we go.
[226:26.98]Can't see.
[226:32.84]That's really awkward to do this.
[226:35.50]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[226:36.59]I don't like that.
[226:37.13]I'm not doing that again.
[226:39.27]That's really weird and hard to do that shit.
[226:42.61]What do I do from here?
[226:43.31]I have to just... Okay.
[226:49.14]There's wind and shit.
[226:49.94]Alright, I'm done.
[226:50.46]I'm done.
[226:50.68]I did it.
[226:50.90]I did it.
[226:51.12]I did it.
[226:51.38]Where is it?
[226:51.68]Where are we going?
[226:53.30]Where are we going?
[226:56.72]Where we going?
[227:12.83]It's over a tower.
[227:14.31]I'm alright.
[227:14.67]I'm alright.
[227:14.97]I'm alright.
[227:15.23]I'm okay.
[227:15.45]I'm okay.
[227:15.71]I got it.
[227:32.10]Yeah!
[227:32.54]I only died a million times.
[227:48.66]Yeah, I don't know.
[227:52.16]I thought I was gonna be on a cloud.
[227:56.76]Alright, I just want to see what's in this one.
[227:58.60]I want to see what's in it.

[233:21.27]And now we shall race to that flag.
[233:23.21]Okay.

[233:34.38]By the way, the current record is 35 seconds.
[233:37.76]Are you at the ready?
[233:38.28]Then set and go.
[233:46.96]I don't even know where is it.
[234:10.89]I was trying to just cheat but I guess I can't do that Alright, how do I die
[234:31.15]I thought I was gonna just get over there right there.
[234:34.83]Cheating into hell.
[234:35.91]Imagine if I hit the flag.
[234:37.91]That would've been fucking crazy.
[234:43.57]Alright, do that again.
[234:44.17]Can I just drown?
[235:02.80]It would just be faster just to finish.
[235:08.02]Oh, what?
[235:08.56]I thought there was a... Well, I went the wrong way.
[235:14.67]Just give me the thing so I can get up there.
[235:18.31]This pendant's because you said his name wrong.

[236:00.79]If I went this way?

[266:40.47]Why can't I just...
[267:32.74]Boink!
[267:34.85]No, no, I wanted to... Alright, I got it.
[267:36.71]We got subs?
[267:37.23]How many subs did we get?
[267:37.81]Let me see.
[267:40.01]We got 10 community subs.
[267:41.65]10 from JermaSucks.
[267:42.99]Thanks a lot, JermaSucks.
[267:45.90]Thanks for the, uh, 10 subs.
[267:47.70]More than that, you gave like 15.
[267:51.16]I need help again.
[267:51.78]This is where I'm gonna do... I'm gonna make a dodgeball NES.
[268:00.45]Dodgeball NES reference here.
[268:06.38]And you turn and throw it backwards.
[268:17.05]That's actually, like, one of the best games to come out on regular Nintendo.
[268:19.95]And I don't know why the hell they didn't make it and, like, do it again.
[268:23.15]That's one of the most... That game is crazy.
[268:28.58]That game is so good.
[268:29.42]Why would they not make that again?
[268:31.48]Or do it in another spot?
[268:32.38]But that game was so fun.
[268:37.53]Alright, let's do the... Let's get in here.
[268:48.09]The game dodgeball for regular Nintendo is one of the best video games.
[268:51.07]Hold on.
[268:51.87]I was gonna talk really fast.
[268:54.17]Slow it down.
[268:57.93]I thought that was a sword.
[268:58.93]I was like, holy shit, he has a knife.
[269:16.45]That is Pina Island.
[269:18.53]The villain's secret hideout must be there.
[269:24.93]Okay.
[269:26.01]How do I get there?
[269:26.63]Oh.
[269:28.29]That's how.
[269:32.88]Okay.
[269:35.62]That's how you get there.
[269:40.20]Uh... Pina Park.
[269:42.38]Mecha Bowser appears.
[269:49.62]Mecha Bowser.
[270:01.39]Wait, it's a theme park.
[270:08.61]You know, I was gonna make the reference that I could see the Superman Ride of Steel ride from here.
[270:15.21]I didn't.
[270:16.33]This is cool.
[270:20.68]The entrance to Pinna Park is just straight over that way.
[270:23.62]You can't miss it.
[270:25.44]You still did.
[270:26.00]Well, I was going to do it a long time ago.
[270:27.40]Too bad.
[270:28.18]A bunch of people would have probably laughed and been like, that guy's way fucking funny.
[270:32.40]I like him.
[270:32.84]I should probably stay here.
[270:35.13]Fuck.
[270:36.09]It's alright.
[270:36.43]It's okay.
[270:51.12]Hey, you!
[270:51.90]What's wrong?
[270:54.02]Hello there.
[270:54.52]Do I have water?
[271:00.49]What is this saying?
[271:05.67]Whoa, that's... Let's have mo, let's have a dip.
[271:16.21]Let's have a dip.
[271:19.67]I'm loving it.
[271:21.86]I'm loving it.
[271:23.44]I don't think that's what it is.
[271:27.47]Hello, doesn't the sunshine feel lovely?
[271:38.63]Oh, they're not saying anything.
[271:43.17]I think it's just... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[271:47.45]Okay.
[271:52.20]Okay, uh, I need to get in to... This is to get back, but I don't want to go back.
[271:57.94]I want to go and fight Mechadouser.
[272:05.13]What was it you guys saying?
[272:05.91]Hit a... While I dive, I can jump and... sprays?
[272:17.41]Slide into a spray.
[272:23.20]Spray water, then slide.
[272:24.38]If you dive into your water, you go fast.
[272:35.58]Wait, you're talking about like I go like this, and then dive into the... Oh, shit.
[272:57.18]That actually kind of works.
[272:58.50]Huh.
[273:09.96]What the fuck?
[273:13.01]What?
[273:16.73]Why can I go with this?
[273:18.27]Why can I do this?
[273:23.51]That's unfair.
[273:24.09]Alright.
[273:24.81]Well, we're going in.
[273:25.79]What do you have to say?
[273:39.00]Wait, I just learned my new tech!
[273:44.92]Got ya.
[273:51.77]Think of all the shit that just went down Mario's pants.
[273:54.33]Well, he's got overalls on for a reason.
[273:55.79]They're pretty secure.
[274:16.67]Holy shit Well, uh
[274:47.09]Shadow of the Colossus.
[274:52.17]What a spectacle.
[274:52.83]Is this a new show of ours?
[274:57.57]You guys are great.
[274:58.11]Whoever hired you needs a raise.
[275:00.18]I love how you play the fearless hero and he's like a bad version of you.
[275:04.78]But you both look the same and stuff.
[275:07.60]Well, as director of this park, I want to ensure your success.
[275:09.98]So how about I provide you with a hero's vehicle?
[275:14.61]What?
[275:22.69]We're riding the roller coaster?
[275:32.26]A bullet bill approaches from behind.
[275:34.32]Holy shit.
[275:41.22]Alright.
[275:42.97]How do I stop him?
[275:46.37]How do I stop him?
[275:48.39]Okay, we're good.
[275:51.19]You gotta shoot him in the chest.
[275:56.39]What the fuck was that?
[275:57.29]Alright, missile.
[276:02.05]That was the... Oh, okay.
[276:09.99]I need a missile for in there.
[276:21.62]I press a button?
[276:28.06]And the head?

[276:47.11]Ugh.
[276:49.54]Ugh.

[277:45.44]Wink?
[277:47.00]Was there?
[278:01.30]This wink shit is the worst thing to happen to the channel.
[278:03.62]Well, don't worry, because it's going away in a few days.
[278:05.72]I'm taking it off permanently, don't worry.
[278:16.17]Get over there.
[278:18.37]Got him!

[287:11.97]Where's the sunglasses guy?
[287:15.39]I wanna talk.
[287:27.78]Oh, uncork the waterfall.
[287:39.11]I've been kind of... I have an unfortunate thing to say right now.
[287:45.41]I've been kind of hiding the fact that something weird happened.
[287:51.91]Not hiding, that's the wrong word.
[287:53.66]Something kind of strange just happened, like 30 minutes ago or so.
[287:56.96]20 minutes ago.
[288:01.39]my like this is hard to describe um this is new and weird it's kind of freaking me out uh my like throat my like the muscle in my back of my tongue and into my throat it hurts uh this is new like as if I pulled a muscle back there as this is brand new I don't know what's going on here I don't know why this is happening
[288:30.21]Not a sore throat.
[288:31.87]Like, the muscles in my actual tongue behind my... This is weird.
[288:39.08]It was... It hurt.
[288:40.12]It was like, ow, that hurt.
[288:41.22]But I didn't do anything.
[288:41.80]I didn't say anything.
[288:42.62]I was just sitting there.
[288:43.85]Just playing.
[288:44.81]I hadn't even spoken yet.
[288:45.67]It was very weird.
[288:50.89]No, no, no.
[288:52.08]This is, like, muscle pain.
[288:53.94]And the reason why it's kind of pissing me off and freaking me out is because of the whole costochondritis thing.
[289:00.58]Like, I've had pain in my ribs that just came out of nowhere for no reason.
[289:04.90]And I'm going to be real mad if now I just have, like, muscle pain in the back of my tongue now.
[289:11.33]You know what I mean?
[289:11.93]Like, what the fuck?
[289:13.79]It's freaking me out.
[289:23.94]Well, I'm alright, but... I might have to stop screaming.
[289:35.81]Hmm... No, it's not like my voice.
[289:40.67]It's not like my vocal cords.
[289:42.01]It's like... weird to describe.
[289:46.03]It's kind of annoying.
[289:48.74]He's making it up to leave.
[289:50.12]I want to play Mario Sunshine!
[289:56.66]I'm having so much fun.
[289:58.14]This sucks.
[290:04.96]I'm gonna monitor it for now.
[290:06.78]But I want to let you guys know what's happening.
[290:08.75]Because I might have to stop in a little bit.
[290:11.85]If it stays.
[290:18.13]This is very sudden and very new.
[290:25.43]Lay on the floor for a minute?
[290:34.86]He has a muscle cramp in your tongue.
[290:36.62]Well, the reason why I'm bringing it up is just because... I just got, those of you that don't know, I just got diagnosed, like, three or four months ago with costochondritis, which is just, like, mystery inflammation in your ribcage for no reason.
[290:49.41]And there's no start, there's no stop, it's just there.
[290:51.47]So, it's just like, eh, is this, like, another thing now that's happening?
[290:56.49]It's pissing me off.
[290:58.11]I'm pissed off right now.
[290:58.89]It's pissing me off.
[291:01.15]Anyways, Mario Sunshine, let's go.
[291:14.16]What was it?
[291:14.88]Uncork the waterfall.
[291:15.76]Alright, let's go.
[291:19.90]Where's the waterfall?
[291:24.74]Is it all the way up?
[291:47.44]Oh, well, there is a cannon up there.
[292:18.15]I don't know who did it, but someone corked our waterfall.
[292:21.51]This no doubt is why our lovely bay has become polluted.
[292:27.97]Stay away from WebMD.
[292:29.44]No, dude.
[292:31.52]I've been to the doctor like 17 times in the last two years.
[292:35.90]I've had a colonoscopy.
[292:36.96]I've had an upper endoscopy.
[292:38.40]I've had fucking x-rays of my whole body.
[292:40.24]Don't worry.
[292:41.14]It's not like, hi, I wonder, do I have this?
[292:43.99]We got a pretty clear diagnosis on a couple of things, but this is like another thing that just kind of came out of nowhere for no reason.
[292:51.11]So.
[292:51.37]Write it down.
[292:51.89]Put it on the list.
[292:55.61]Please fulfill this old man's wish.

[293:44.60]There we go.
[293:47.98]Alright, hold on.
[293:58.15]Can I press that?
[294:06.65]Were they doing an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy at the same time?
[294:10.11]Trying to meet in the middle.
[294:15.92]We just wanted to see if we could do it.
[294:19.82]Period.
[294:23.25]That's so stupid.
[294:38.52]Now we go... On the wheel?
[294:45.49]Can I weigh the wheel down?
[294:48.79]I'm gonna run out of water.

[300:31.68]Oh, I don't think so.
[300:34.20]I gotta go this way.
[300:37.60]From here... Why can't I... Oh, wait!
[300:55.16]Oh shit, I got it.
[301:08.81]Hey!
[301:11.25]What?
[301:15.96]That's so far away now.
[301:21.84]We had a $100 drop just come in right now.
[301:27.36]$100 from Shady Seas.
[301:29.94]I can't go in this water.
[301:30.80]I can't go in this water.
[301:31.54]I can't go in this water.
[301:32.24]I can't go in this water.
[301:35.49]Thank you, Shady Seas, for the 10,000 bits.
[301:40.31]Thanks for the huge money drop.
[301:42.92]They say, I've been living with Cosmo Conjurators for a long time and it really sucks.
[301:46.66]Your streams have helped out a lot when it's flared up really bad.
[301:48.78]Hope you're doing better now and take some time off if you need to recover.
[301:52.58]Yeah, I'm alright.
[301:53.48]I'm good.
[301:54.02]It's just... It's just irritating.
[302:02.55]Don't worry.
[302:03.43]I'm doing physical therapy for this shit.
[302:06.95]I've been going for the last couple weeks.
[302:10.91]Like two or three weeks?
[302:13.71]But, uh, that's why, you know, it's not like it's a concern, but... This is... I really do hope that I just kind of tweak something randomly for no reason, because... Oh, first it was in your back, now it's in your ribcage, now it's in your tongue!
[302:28.95]Wow!
[302:29.61]Hooray!
[302:32.59]Life really is pain.
[302:35.17]Oh, shit.
[302:35.83]Made it.
[302:49.49]Maybe it's working its way out of you.
[302:51.59]Maybe it's trying to get out of your mouth.
[302:56.27]Let's go up there?
[303:00.25]All the way up?
[303:06.89]Let me go all the way up first.
[303:07.71]This place is crazy.
[303:19.38]You gotta get that big cork.
[303:26.22]Make sure you read!
[303:27.04]Read!
[303:27.46]Read!
[303:27.96]Read!
[303:28.36]Read chat!
[303:29.06]Read it!
[303:29.69]Read chat!
[303:30.39]We need to read!
[303:32.25]Read!
[303:41.23]We gotta rip out that cork.
[303:44.49]Alright.
[303:45.11]Is that a cork?
[303:48.35]Or is that an onion?
[304:04.11]That's not a waterfall.
[304:05.51]Yeah, I'm trying to find them.
[304:06.17]I'm trying to look to see where the waterfall is.
[304:08.99]Where is this waterfall?
[304:09.99]Over here?
[304:14.64]I don't see any waterfalls.
[304:22.50]I'm staring at it?
[304:25.02]Oh, up there.
[304:26.36]Right.
[304:26.56]I thought that was a fucking honeycomb, like a beehive or something.
[304:31.93]Alright, so...
[304:40.55]I just wrap all the way around.
[304:41.61]Should I try to just just YOLO jump this and get up there?
[304:44.85]What do you think?
[304:48.74]Alright, let's go I fell off the edge.
[305:01.03]I didn't even jump I fell
[305:09.94]Alright, let's get that big core.
[305:20.20]What do you want?
[305:22.56]Oh, Yamario, that guy down there is my teacher.
[305:24.44]I mean, my grandpa.
[305:25.70]Hehe, that cork is farther up ahead.
[305:27.21]Be careful, though.
[305:28.27]There's a weird guy perched on top of it.
[305:30.41]He'll start tossing explosives at you if you get too close.
[305:33.03]I thought you might need help, so I got you this spring.
[305:36.35]Spray it, it'll shrink.
[305:37.29]Really?
[305:40.69]Oh, that's cool.
[305:41.31]That's pretty sick.
[305:44.95]Alright, just bring it with me.
[305:51.23]Should I throw it over there?
[305:52.03]Should I throw it down?
[305:53.85]Should I throw it over there?
[305:54.73]I'm gonna throw it down, because I fall.
[306:02.21]Do I even need this?
[306:29.22]Eat shit.
[306:30.10]I know what to do.
[306:40.48]No, stop with the three, two, one.
[306:42.38]Did I hit him?
[306:48.88]Is this not... I don't think I'm hitting this shit.
[307:00.74]I got him.
[307:06.82]Give me that cork.
[307:15.31]Thank God.
[307:16.05]Did I fall all the way down?
[307:21.28]I jumped over the edge.
[307:22.22]We're good.
[307:31.23]Wait, no.
[307:34.61]Oh, there's coins down here.
[307:36.65]Are there blue coins?
[307:39.45]No?
[307:40.89]That was cool.
[307:56.89]But what's up there?
[307:57.61]I don't know.
[307:59.21]That's a good question.
[308:08.22]You want me to do that again?
[308:10.93]That very clearly was like, hey, please do that again.
[308:13.03]Alright.
[308:19.13]The boss of Tricky Ruins.
[308:30.66]Off to the old man.
[308:42.76]Can I talk to the kid yeah, yeah, alright, what do you want me to do
[308:59.49]You have returned our waterfall to normal.
[309:01.25]Bravo.
[309:01.75]What's that?
[309:02.23]The ocean's still dirty.
[309:03.31]Strange.
[309:03.97]It looks like my theory was way off.
[309:06.31]Yo, Ho-Ho, Hackpeth.
[309:08.41]That's okay.
[309:08.79]I think I've got a lead on the real cause.
[309:10.63]Now, this may not seem like much of a reward, but I'm gonna reveal to you one of Noki Bay's deepest secrets.
[309:25.69]Grandpa, I got like 30 of these.
[309:28.43]This bay actually contains the tomb of an ancient Noki king.
[309:33.13]When you spray water on the wall paintings, a path usually opens.
[309:36.23]It's almost like magic and one path leads to a hidden shrine.
[309:40.23]Honestly, this is all true, maybe.
[309:48.87]Found it.
[309:55.49]I just exploded your eardrums.
[310:03.57]That was bad for me, too.
[310:05.59]That was bad for me, too.
[310:07.31]Trust me.
[310:09.06]Okay, always remember, if it's bad for you, it's very bad for me, too.
[310:12.80]I got a direct line here, you know what I mean?
[310:16.98]Oh, fuck.
[310:22.94]Oh, well you gotta do it fast then, huh?
[310:24.80]Don't you?
[310:25.18]Cover your rears.
[310:30.85]I'll do it for you.
[310:52.87]How the hell are we going?
[310:56.41]Twice?
[310:58.87]Wait, what?
[310:59.65]What are you talking about?
[311:19.47]You're cheating, now you're watching a speedrun.
[311:21.44]I just opened up a video.
[311:51.73]Audio splicing.
[311:52.99]I'm not splicing any audio.
[311:56.17]What audio do you hear is being spliced?
[311:57.89]I'm not splicing audio.
[312:05.57]I did it.
[312:08.11]I mean, I want that.
[312:31.79]F squid f squid f squid Alright, let's keep going there's another thing to spray over here
[312:52.01]Yeah, F-Squid.

[312:57.36]Dead.
[312:57.60]Dead.
[313:00.02]Yeah, dead.
[313:02.92]Grandma, can I ask a question?
[313:04.24]Yeah.
[313:04.88]What is it?
[313:07.77]Ask.
[313:08.03]Dead.
[313:10.03]Ask.
[313:23.95]Wasn't ready for that one.
[313:34.04]Shit, sorry.
[313:39.40]Oh no!
[313:41.06]We're good.
[313:43.68]Oh no!
[313:52.11]Oh no, it's gonna crush me!
[313:55.70]I made it.
[313:56.82]This is the secret!
[314:03.22]I don't have any water.
[314:10.86]Is there... You got water near you?
[314:14.58]Oh, water.
[314:14.96]Give me that.
[314:21.47]Alright, spray a space.

[315:44.32]Tag me when Jerma lies.
[315:54.95]I don't need to prove this.
[316:01.94]I've already shown it.
[316:03.26]You guys know it's real.
[316:04.86]You guys know it's real?
[316:05.82]It's real!
[316:16.12]Prove that there's no crumbs in the Wii.
[316:19.07]I can't guarantee that.
[316:21.89]I ate a whole lot of weird shit up here and put my hands all over the controller and stuff.
[316:30.51]Back here again?
[316:33.30]Alright, you got it.
[316:40.03]Wipe your hands after you eat.
[316:41.19]I do.

[329:52.91]Oh, no, no.
[329:56.49]What if his teeth fell off?
[329:58.96]Well, he didn't treat his mouth well for like 20 years.
[330:01.56]It's not my fault.
[330:02.32]I didn't do anything.
[330:03.10]I'm just cleaning.
[330:11.00]And there we are.
[330:12.88]Take care of your teeth or you're going to fucking jail.

[331:12.70]There it is.
[331:13.48]Got it.
[331:22.86]But what about the heart?

[343:41.76]That was seriously the fucking best thing ever.
[343:44.66]I don't even care if I got hurt there.

[344:36.07]I don't understand what's going on.
[344:50.16]How do you pull a muscle in your tongue?
[344:52.06]How do I pull all these muscles in my chest and back?
[344:54.28]It doesn't make any sense.
[344:55.52]I feel like Mario does right now.
[344:57.72]Another one?
[345:03.67]What was that?
[345:17.22]Do you even exercise anymore?
[345:18.44]Yeah, I go to physical therapy.

[345:27.45]Alright, back in there.
[345:32.47]No, Pachinko.

[346:10.33]Alright, fine.
[346:10.81]I'll do Pachinko.
[346:11.91]Fine.
[346:18.25]Fine, I'll do Pachinko.
[346:28.42]Wait, do I want to do that?
[346:30.02]Maybe.
[346:40.37]It's not going as fast as I want it to go!
[346:46.07]Oh wait, Pachinko's under the bridge.
[346:48.21]I forgot.
[346:50.48]It's in a weird spot.
[346:52.16]Where am I going?
[347:00.12]Yeah, I don't know where the fuck I'm going.
[347:05.25]Help them, they're on fire.
[347:06.89]No, I can't do anything.
[347:10.15]What do I want to do?
[347:12.09]I want to go over here.
[347:12.97]Alright, give me the boat.
[347:21.18]Fucking tried to jump.
[347:22.00]The control is like, the control is broken.
[347:26.50]Get in there!
[347:27.10]You have to do it first try or I'm going to bed.
[347:43.06]Fucking dumb, fucking dumb, fucking idiot game.
[347:44.74]Fucking stupid fucking game.
[347:46.80]Which side does it come from?
[347:47.54]Here it is.
[347:56.95]Great camera work.
[347:58.01]Write up the review right now.
[347:59.29]Great camera.
[348:00.31]The camera's the best part of Mario Sunshine.
[348:02.55]It's got a great camera system.
[348:04.15]That's what I'm going to write when I do my review.
[348:12.64]Oh, man.
[348:13.02]It's going to be a scathing review.
[348:16.14]People are going to read it and be like, whoa, he really didn't like this.
[348:18.38]I'm going to be like, I'm typing wicked hard on the keys.
[348:29.65]Hey!
[348:39.82]Here comes both.
[349:09.72]You tell me I can't get in there.
[349:10.68]Yes, I can.
[349:11.38]I'll just fuck it up.
[349:15.72]That's unbelievable.
[349:16.92]Just go.
[349:18.86]If you do it first try, you can't do it first try.
[349:20.96]It's impossible.
[349:22.59]There's no first try pachinko machine.
[349:25.11]You need at least like three or four pachinkos.
[349:30.17]I just figured out how to do this.
[349:36.29]I figured out how to do this.
[349:46.77]I can't fit in there?
[350:10.14]How do I not fit in here?
[350:12.36]Why is it like an invisible wall?
[350:16.33]What?
[350:19.41]Oh, come on!
[350:28.43]So, is it Vinny first tried this?
[350:32.17]I want proof of that, and I want $100.
[350:34.47]I want proof and $100.
[350:35.11]Buddy, I think... Why?
[350:54.86]Like, why does that even... Why do you need to have that?
[350:57.23]I don't understand.
[351:11.14]I should not have fucking said that.
[351:12.62]That was stupid.
[351:14.51]I forgot.
[351:14.91]I can't make money jokes.
[351:16.99]Because somebody will do the joke.
[351:19.87]But the joke is... It's not even a joke.
[351:21.97]I now have an extra $100 now because you did that.
[351:26.38]By Latria, let's just give $100.
[351:27.38]That's $100.
[351:27.64]10,000 bits.
[351:29.94]They say you rang.
[351:30.44]Well, I didn't.
[351:30.76]Did I?
[351:32.02]I did.
[351:32.26]Alright.
[351:45.10]Give me it.
[351:45.60]It's right there.
[351:46.74]Oh, come on.
[351:49.48]How many lives do I have?
[351:52.18]Do I have no more lives?
[351:56.33]Okay, I have another one.
[352:00.77]Okay.
[352:22.64]Can I get out of this?
[352:37.10]What do you get for doing this?
[352:37.96]Do you just get one shine for doing this?
[352:39.70]I would put that in the not worth doing category.
[352:47.52]Yep.
[352:49.04]Huh.
[353:02.34]Okay.
[353:10.03]I just have to make sure I actually go into one of the holes.
[353:12.87]If you don't make it into one of the holes, you're just screwed.
[353:15.89]It's over.
[353:16.29]Uh-oh.
[353:20.53]It's over.
[353:28.49]No, it's not.
[353:28.77]It's not over.
[353:34.62]I can make it onto the left.
[353:36.16]Watch this.
[353:36.66]Why can't I leave?
[353:37.42]I can't go to the left?
[353:38.82]Accept your fate.
[353:39.44]No.
[353:39.58]Because there's glass.
[354:04.97]I'm not accepting shit!
[354:13.11]Just build speed for 12 hours.
[354:36.93]Build speed for 12 hours.
[354:44.89]Keep licking it, boys!
[354:46.33]No way.
[355:22.69]Nothing matters with this.
[355:28.22]This is the pachinko level.
[355:29.46]This is the dreaded pachinko level.
[355:31.52]Guys need to know.
[355:32.74]Should they be shaving them?
[355:34.35]It's sexier if it's true.
[355:36.09]You just feel sexier when you dance.
[355:38.83]I'm getting bombarded.
[355:40.11]I'm being bombarded.
[355:42.05]I go to the barber every two weeks.
[355:45.82]Okay, here we go.
[355:49.90]I can see it.
[355:51.16]Is this first try?
[355:52.08]Is it actually first try?
[355:56.98]Same thing happened to me.
[356:15.17]Yeah.
[356:27.28]I'm sorry, what was the problem?
[356:34.87]I think Shadow Mario is just magical.
[356:36.53]You're right.
[356:42.67]You're right.
[356:43.33]This is the pachinko level.
[356:44.53]This is the dreaded pachinko level.
[356:46.13]Right there.
[356:50.55]Pretty sneaky edit there.
[356:52.48]I caught it.
[356:52.92]I'm a video fucking guy.
[356:54.20]You think I don't know that?
[357:02.17]This was three years ago.
[357:07.79]Spliced.
[357:15.75]Let him sleep.
[357:23.79]Hey, remember when you played Mario Sunshine three years ago?
[357:27.51]I do that.
[357:28.01]I did that now.
[357:30.42]I did this for them to first try, hey!
[357:34.11]Why?
[357:34.45]Alright, I'm... What did I want to do?
[357:52.84]Secret of the Dirty Lake.
[357:53.66]That's what I wanted to do.
[357:54.44]Not pachinko.
[357:55.24]I'm not doing it.
[357:56.82]I am not going to do pachinko.
[357:59.14]We're gonna do Secret of the Dirty Lake.
[358:01.62]And then... Remember, we'll go... Hey.
[358:06.08]We're going five days in a row this week.
[358:09.31]Probably.
[358:10.55]Maybe three.
[358:11.95]Maybe.
[358:12.53]I don't know.
[358:14.15]Because I just... Wow, what a backtrack.
[358:15.75]Backtrack Andy.
[358:17.41]Backtrack Barry.
[358:19.21]Um...
[358:20.62]I want to beat Mario Sunshine this week.
[358:22.80]So... I might go four or five days in a row.
[358:25.78]And then we're doing Community Content Night, so... You know.
[358:29.75]I don't know.
[358:34.99]I want to beat this before Community Content Night.
[358:42.86]In before no stream for the rest of the week.
[358:45.30]I would not start this now.
[358:48.37]And then not stream tomorrow.
[358:50.35]And the next day, and probably the next day, and the next day.
[358:53.37]I'm into this.
[358:53.97]I want to do this.
[358:56.53]Alright.
[358:57.53]Most... More importantly.
[359:01.25]I need to... Alright, where was it?
[359:06.87]It's like over here, isn't it?
[359:07.75]I don't know.
[359:09.67]The dirty lake.
[359:10.35]The dirty lake.
[359:10.97]I need the... I'm going to keep this.
[359:12.25]I don't want the rocket.
[359:12.97]That was a dumb mistake.
[359:16.43]How's my throat doing?
[359:17.43]It still hurts.
[359:19.61]But I'm kind of just gonna see what happens when I get up tomorrow.
[359:22.57]I should be fine.
[359:23.21]I don't know.
[359:23.85]It's just, like, weird.
[359:25.91]It just doesn't make any sense.
[359:26.77]Because, like, I've been alive for 34 years.
[359:30.10]This shit, like, it just never fucking happens in my life.
[359:33.32]It's just weird.
[359:35.00]Alright, let's go.
[359:35.61]I need to go to the dirty lake, which is the other way.
[359:44.69]Got boomer pain now.
[359:46.81]Eh, probably.
[359:49.02]Alright, where is that dirty-ass lake?
[359:54.18]Over there?
[359:58.32]I missed... Did I miss bits?
[359:59.36]Where?
[360:04.89]Oh, I did.
[360:05.31]Why is this down here?
[360:06.11]Oh, that was a hundred bucks.
[360:11.71]Another hundred.
[360:12.37]Look at all the red.
[360:13.65]Red.
[360:14.70]There's so much red today.
[360:18.49]Red, red, red, red, red.
[360:20.09]There's like hundreds of dollars of red.
[360:22.35]Uh, core monster, 10,000 bit.
[360:30.07]Fucking hundred bucks.
[360:32.53]There's another hundo in it for you if you beat Pachinko.
[360:35.21]I will, but maybe not today.
[360:38.32]We're on this for the long haul, guys.
[360:39.90]This is the stream the next, like, four, at least, probably three or four days in a row, at least.
[360:44.03]This is what we're doing.
[360:45.37]I'll get... Sorry, I almost spurted in your face.
[360:47.71]That would have been really rude.
[360:56.00]There it is.
[360:57.64]Alright.
[360:58.62]Go over there.
[361:21.61]Sorry, I still made it.
[361:23.39]What the hell?
[361:27.72]You got the turbo nozzle.
[361:32.94]Turbo nozzle?
[361:34.78]Press and hold R to power up the turbo nozzle and do a super dash.
[361:40.25]We gotta go in here first.
[361:42.81]Oh, this is one of these levels.
[361:44.85]Uh-oh.
[361:48.27]Uh-oh.
[361:51.73]Holy fuck!
[361:56.33]Panics.
[361:56.73]Panics.
[361:57.21]There was some panics there.
[362:22.99]I bet Jerma can't do this first try.
[362:24.47]Well, you can't bet that I'm not gonna do something after I fail it.
[362:28.45]You gotta do that well before.
[362:29.77]Like, during this first loading screen.
[362:41.39]I fucked it up!
[362:42.61]I thought it was... I fucked it up.
[362:47.49]I just... I don't know why I didn't know where it was gonna spin.
[362:53.26]You bet I can't do this within five tries.
[362:54.78]You're probably right.
[362:56.56]Sometimes you gotta go fucking risky shit like this.
[363:00.72]Oh, how did I dive?
[363:03.26]That would've been fine.
[363:15.45]You just instinctively press buttons in Mario.
[363:17.99]I don't know why.
[363:22.79]Probably the right play, though.
[363:23.79]Let's be safe.
[363:34.92]Did I not make that?
[363:35.72]Are you serious?
[363:37.82]I needed to be, like, further up.
[363:44.12]Yeah, you actually, you probably have to go to the other one.
[363:46.52]I was trying to skip it.
[363:56.18]It sounds drained?
[363:59.64]No, it's just this... No, I'm fine.
[364:02.04]I don't want anyone to be concerned about me.
[364:06.06]I'm alright.
[364:13.73]I wanna do this.
[364:18.65]I already am.
[364:20.29]Oh, he's coming down from the crack.
[364:24.27]That's the problem.
[364:25.71]He just smoked so much crack and now he's like on the down.
[364:28.72]I've been having a lot of fun though.
[364:36.01]This game is fun.
[364:36.97]It's fun just to play and just dick around and stuff.
[364:41.49]He needs more crack.
[364:42.55]I was probably gonna end soon, anyways.
[364:44.83]I wanted to do... I wanted to, like, separate this out between, like, three to five, like, six to seven hour streams.
[364:51.75]So there's plenty of content to do every day.
[364:58.78]He's really gonna stretch out Mario Sunshine.
[365:01.22]Yeah, I mean, I... Yeah.
[365:02.42]Yeah.
[365:04.17]Yeah.
[365:11.60]Alright, why am I going over this way?
[365:20.23]Stalling.
[365:21.59]Well, it's not stalling, it's just spreading.
[365:25.13]Stalling would be if I sat at the starting soon screen talking about how I can't wait to play Mario Sunshine for 45 minutes.
[365:37.65]I started playing almost immediately, so that's different.
[365:43.38]I'm going to try this... Here's the plan.
[365:45.73]Try this one more time like this.
[365:48.87]And then I am going to go... Wait, Otto, what's the matter?
[365:52.41]You want to leave?
[365:54.42]Alright, give me a sec.
[365:56.02]Otto's like, I want to get out of this room.
[365:57.48]You want to get out of the room?
[365:59.76]Okay.
[365:59.86]Hold on.
[366:31.34]Okay, he's good.
[366:33.66]Oh, he's diluting his content here.
[366:35.40]He's diluting.
[366:38.64]I'm not diluting.
[366:51.39]Diluting?
[366:51.87]What do you mean dilute?
[366:52.47]I'm not diluting.
[366:55.59]Oh, I mean, and Mario, yeah.
[366:59.95]That's the whole point.
[367:02.87]He's mega milking his content.
[367:08.79]I shouldn't be laughing at what you said, but I am.
[367:11.31]I shouldn't laugh at that.
[367:13.61]I should not be laughing at that statement.
[367:18.38]He's actually playing Mario Sunshine?
[367:19.98]Yeah, that's fucking great.
[367:21.22]This game's awesome.
[367:23.04]I love it so far.
[367:27.26]Alright, here we go.
[367:33.04]Spin, and here we are.
[367:34.50]Alright, that's the plan.
[367:35.76]Here we go.
[367:36.30]Get them one up.
[367:39.70]Really?
[367:39.94]Okay.
[367:43.12]Now, what happens over here?
[367:44.40]What does this thing do?
[367:45.24]What is that?
[367:49.20]Oh, god.
[367:52.62]Okay, that's, um, alright.
[367:54.20]Can I go down?
[367:55.12]Do a wall run?
[367:56.50]Holy shit.
[367:57.48]Is it moving?
[367:58.56]Oh!
[368:33.84]Fuck those cubes.
[368:34.86]Probably shouldn't even be jumping.
[368:39.18]That was bad.
[368:41.94]What was that weird timing right there?
[368:45.56]The timing's all fucked up.
[368:46.50]Look at this shit.
[368:47.16]What?
[368:49.33]What the hell was that?
[368:50.23]What was with that timing?
[368:58.52]That was weird.
[369:11.01]That was my fault.
[369:11.59]Yeah, it was.
[369:11.91]That was my fault.
[369:13.43]I take full responsibility for what just happened.
[369:22.59]Yeah, let's try this again.
[369:23.47]We're just gonna run.
[369:43.07]Uh, okay, do they sweep across?
[369:45.11]Go!
[369:54.18]Holy shit, that thing tilts us sideways!
[369:57.54]Wow!
[370:00.22]It started to turn and tilt.
[370:01.58]Aw, they threw- I gotta run into the corner when that happens.
[370:26.79]At least I'm getting this every time.
[370:29.63]So we can do this an infinite amount of times.
[370:32.19]They're trying to teach me.
[370:38.28]Then I'm gonna- the corner shit.
[370:39.64]I'm gonna lose it.
[370:40.24]I'm gonna fail it again, probably.
[370:41.38]I wouldn't be surprised.
[370:43.24]Okay, here we go.
[371:15.45]Okay, what the hell?
[371:17.07]I had to hit my head on the ceiling.
[371:19.01]Okay.
[371:22.40]What happens here?
[371:27.17]I don't know.
[371:27.73]I don't know what to do.
[371:28.83]I'm gonna... Which one?
[371:35.57]This one?
[371:40.11]Which one?
[371:46.75]Oh yeah!
[371:47.89]Oh yeah!
[371:49.90]I now jump off for a joke.
[371:59.19]Okay.
[372:29.64]Okay.
[372:31.24]Save the game.
[372:32.22]Save.
[372:33.06]26 stars, 39 blue coins.
[372:34.56]And that's what I'm going to call it.
[372:42.39]Stretching content is what we call this.
[372:44.87]It's six hours.
[372:45.85]This is going to be like a... That's normal.
[372:47.73]Six to seven hours, that's a normal stream for me.
[372:59.76]No, don't leave.
[373:04.22]You scammed people out of Pachinko.
[373:09.78]No, I'm gonna beat that tomorrow.
[373:17.49]This is not a normal game, Jeremy.
[373:19.71]No, it's Mario Sunshine Week.
[373:24.39]Please, that guy's on fire!
[373:42.72]I got him, I got him.
[373:43.60]I think, does this guy want to be on fire?
[374:11.26]I think this guy wants to be a... Oh.
[374:15.00]Well, you saved me.
[374:15.62]Thanks a bundle.
[374:17.60]Holy shit.
[374:18.25]That makes it even 40 points.
[374:25.35]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[374:34.72]uh sorry about the weird like tongue thing that was weird I I don't know why I'm apologizing for that but kind of stopped the stream for like five ten minutes but it's all good uh I'm gonna go drink some tea and hopefully this is not a thing that sticks around because that would really be annoying but um I will see you guys tomorrow
[375:04.50]Around the same time, Mario Sunshine continues.
[375:14.91]Don't put hot shit down your throat if it hurts.
[375:17.45]No, I don't.
[375:18.57]I drink warm tea.
[375:20.51]I don't drink hot tea.
[375:24.91]Don't leave.
[375:25.49]Five more minutes.
[375:26.77]Oh, this isn't the snooze button.
[375:28.59]Well, no.
[375:29.37]Well, I'll be back.
[375:31.16]Tomorrow.
[375:31.98]I'll be back in less than, like, 16 hours.
[375:34.18]Like, 12 hours.
[375:34.64]Hit the snooze.
[375:38.94]No, no.
[375:40.52]I'm going.
[375:42.14]No.
[375:42.46]No snooze button.
[375:44.44]I love this game, too.
[375:45.76]And we're gonna enjoy the fuck out of it for the rest of the week.
[375:49.26]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[375:51.77]Have a great rest of your night.
[375:55.37]Goodbye.
[375:56.65]We'll finish up with the bits and everything and hang out for a little bit.
[376:00.81]See you guys tomorrow.
[376:03.27]I'm not going to keep playing without you, I promise.
[376:05.11]I will literally turn it off right now.
[376:06.45]Ready?
[376:06.77]The game is... Game is saved.
[376:12.78]Save.
[376:13.22]Continue.
[376:14.52]Sure.
[376:14.78]Okay.
[376:16.44]Turn it off.
[376:17.26]I'm going to promise.
[376:18.02]Look, it's going off right now.
[376:25.49]See?
[376:26.47]Told you.
[376:26.75]Thanks for watching.
[376:32.91]See you tomorrow.
[376:38.68]Disconnected video cables.
[376:41.56]I had a lot of fun, though.
[376:42.58]I had a lot of fun.
[376:46.24]This is a great game to play.
[376:47.80]I love it.
[376:48.30]I think it's fantastic.
[376:49.28]And I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[376:50.79]We'll continue tomorrow.
[376:53.41]Well, let's go back.
[376:53.91]We had LM Man for $5 earlier.
[376:57.89]Jerma, you are a greedy tyrant.
[377:02.91]I disagree.
[377:05.05]I disagree.
[377:06.05]Thank you for the $5.
[377:08.61]WembleyTTV, thanks for the $2.50.
[377:10.53]Jerma, I had a dream about you last night with your head on a naked Willem Dafoe body.
[377:15.37]And you were just dancing.
[377:18.37]I woke up screaming.
[377:22.01]Get this nightmare out of my head.
[377:26.74]Well, go watch... Go watch... I don't know.
[377:29.54]Go watch, like, a documentary on... On how trees grow or something.
[377:36.06]I don't get... Dude, watch something else.
[377:39.72]The reason why you're having these dreams is because I'm up there.
[377:43.04]You gotta... Before you go to bed, you gotta watch something else.
[377:44.92]You gotta watch, like...
[377:47.26]So let's say you watch a stream and the stream's over.
[377:49.94]You've got to turn on, like, a baby TV show, like Nick Jr.
[377:53.84]or something.
[377:54.78]Or, uh... I don't know.
[377:57.78]Something else to get, like, more characters in your head right before you go to bed.
[378:01.24]I think that's the problem.
[378:03.98]Watch, like, Spongebob.
[378:04.78]But no, then it'll be me and Spongebob, like, sword fighting.
[378:08.84]So I don't know if I can solve this problem for you.
[378:12.22]I can't get that out of your head.
[378:19.25]That sounds pretty cool.
[378:23.21]So, I can't help you.
[378:24.07]I can't help you.
[378:26.63]Eat less macaroni and cheese right before you go to bed.
[378:29.61]Backbiter, thanks for the five community subs.
[378:35.74]Just five subs.
[378:36.48]Thank you.
[378:37.90]Willgot, thanks for 250.
[378:39.32]Hello, King.
[378:40.16]There it is again.
[378:41.04]The way Mario launches himself with his water pack reminds me of my last episode on the toilet.
[379:00.84]um I was playing indoor mini golf and eating pizza slices served on plates for everyone to grab I was convinced I had the coronavirus anyway keep up the great work king king your streams are as epic as bacon more more uh whatever thanks hey cream corn thanks for the 250. did you write off the carnival stream as a business expense uh
[379:29.51]Yes.
[379:30.97]At least a lot of it.
[379:36.53]Some of that stuff you can't write off.
[379:45.03]To write off... It's not like you'd be like, Okay!
[379:47.99]And this is what happened!
[379:49.65]And there it is!
[379:51.12]It's over.
[379:51.54]You kind of need to go piece by piece.
[379:54.70]But I have... I have a lot of
[379:59.57]documents and things that are ready to go.
[380:01.77]So don't worry about that.
[380:06.06]But for the most part, yes, I can do a lot of writing off on those things.
[380:12.56]But I did say, remember I said this a long time ago, just talking about, you know, spending money on the business, in quotes.
[380:25.12]I'm gonna do shit like that.
[380:26.84]I'm gonna spend a bunch of fucking money if I have it.
[380:32.16]Because if it's available, I want to put it back and try to do something interesting or try to do something fun.
[380:42.38]If I'm capable of doing that, and I have the money to do it, then I'm gonna try.
[380:47.92]Business.
[380:48.36]Laughing my ass off.
[380:59.10]Alright, this warrant's being put on.
[381:05.52]This is good, actually.
[381:06.54]That's great.
[381:08.68]Oh, Super Frog Sunshine!
[381:14.04]But, yeah.
[381:18.43]Yeah, if you're wondering why I took an extra day, I was getting my taxes prepared.
[381:24.11]Get stuff sent to my CPA.
[381:27.05]And get going from there.
[381:28.51]Just get it done.
[381:31.52]That's why I was gone yesterday.
[381:32.86]I just didn't get it done all the way.
[381:38.77]We know you don't do your taxes.
[381:40.17]Yeah.
[381:41.25]I prepare it for somebody else that's way smarter than me to do it.
[381:45.99]Yes, that's correct.
[382:03.50]Why are US taxes so hard?
[382:05.04]For fuck's sake.
[382:07.59]Yeah, it's... Yeah, as well, there's another thing is just especially considering like where like a lot of this money comes from.
[382:16.96]It's a lot more... It's a lot different than just I have a W2.
[382:22.07]And okay, and here's what I owe.
[382:23.31]Here's what I'm going to get back.
[382:25.01]There's a lot of weird little moving parts.
[382:29.53]But that's why it takes a while.
[382:39.84]Fringe taxes for fail country.
[382:45.58]All countries have taxes.
[382:47.26]What are you talking about?
[382:49.49]What are you talking about?
[382:50.57]Where are you?
[382:53.19]Are you on some random island that's in the Atlantic Ocean or something?
[382:56.35]What are you talking about?
[382:56.99]All countries have to pay taxes.
[382:59.87]At least for the most part.
[383:09.55]Alright, let's go.
[383:10.19]Very much so.
[383:13.09]Not under Anthony Banthony.
[383:13.87]I like to eat taxes.
[383:39.60]You guys... American taxes are especially confusing because of lobbying from the very companies you use to do your taxes.
[383:51.02]Don't... Don't... You can't say the evil lord's name out loud.
[383:58.89]Into it.
[383:59.91]Oh, fuck.
[384:12.66]I'll be alright.
[384:22.41]Nice one, Jeremy.
[384:23.51]Solid bit.
[384:24.25]Thanks!
[384:24.73]I appreciate that.
[384:25.71]Thanks a lot.
[384:31.44]They got him.
[384:42.39]Alright, I'm gonna keep moving.
[384:44.60]I'm still super high energy right now, but like... Like, my back of my... Whatever.
[384:49.80]I'm so high energy right now.
[384:51.64]You have no idea.
[384:52.40]I'm gonna bottle this up and take this energy tomorrow.
[384:56.66]Hey, LM man, thanks for the 500 bits.
[384:58.08]Hmm.
[385:13.26]No, I wouldn't be a Toad.
[385:14.88]No, no way.
[385:17.04]Probably a Goomba.
[385:18.80]Yeah, I can see that.
[385:21.44]I could... I would be... I'd be a high-ranking Goomba, though.
[385:25.06]I wouldn't just be, like, a regular Goomba.
[385:27.10]I would be, like, a Goomba Captain.
[385:29.96]I would be a high-ranking Goomba.
[385:37.61]Aren't there some named Goombas in the Mario universe?
[385:41.67]I know there are.
[385:42.13]They've had dialogue lines before.
[385:43.43]In Paper Mario.
[385:52.20]Yeah.
[385:53.32]Could be that one.
[385:57.50]AC4G, thanks for the $2.50.
[385:59.22]People happy.
[386:00.16]Jerma Otto.

[386:36.28]The game's called Clive and Wrench.
[386:39.02]He's available.
[386:43.99]Probably not.
[386:45.07]Look, I'm going to be really honest.
[386:48.13]When I...
[386:49.97]I've been asked to do things before, from other places, and to do lines and shit, and I just never do them.
[386:56.35]I just, like, don't- I- I just lose track, I don't have enough time to do this shit, I- I- I focus on the stream almost 100% if I'm not, and then I'm doing something in my, like, real life.
[387:07.24]I- people have asked me to do some things, and I just haven't done- I've been like, oh, yeah, maybe, or yeah, sure, or no, or... I just don't want to be like, yeah, maybe, oh, sounds good, hit me up, and it just- and it never happened.
[387:22.42]I don't want to tell people that I'll do these things, and I just won't.
[387:24.90]I just don't want to, I want to be honest.
[387:35.63]Too busy doing nothing.
[387:36.99]That's not even true.
[387:39.97]That's not even true.
[387:42.21]I know, I know that a lot of people think when the stream is up, I sit in the chair, and there's like a feeding tube in my mouth, and then the stream turns on, and I'm here.
[387:52.47]I know, that's what a lot of people think happens.
[387:57.60]I just sit here and stare at the blank monitor for three days.
[388:05.78]You just schlep around your house naked.
[388:17.59]Do a line for the Rat King right now.
[388:20.41]Get out of here, will you, stupid?
[388:22.29]I'll kill you.
[388:25.77]Uh... I'll just slow that down.
[388:30.49]Like, pitch that tempo down, like, 10 to 20%.
[388:32.97]That's not family-friendly?
[388:36.91]I'm a boss!
[388:37.99]It's supposed to be a boss battle!
[388:39.45]He's supposed to say, I'm gonna get you, or I'm gonna attack you, or something. ...
[388:50.87]Yeah, you can literally just use that.
[388:52.87]I don't even care.
[388:55.21]I don't care.
[388:55.73]You don't have to pay me.
[388:57.47]You don't have to pay me.
[388:58.41]Don't worry.
[388:58.75]I just use it.
[389:05.30]I don't care.
[389:05.78]How about some dialogue pop-ups?
[389:08.38]Huh?
[389:10.50]What is it?
[389:12.43]What are you doing?
[389:16.07]Oh, oh.
[389:17.47]Oh, okay.
[389:20.21]What's that?
[389:22.20]Get over here.
[389:23.62]I'll get you.
[389:25.12]Get over here.
[389:26.20]I'll get you.
[389:28.18]Use it wherever you want, it doesn't matter.
[389:37.13]Ask for cheese, oh yeah.
[389:41.39]Give me that cheese.
[389:42.15]Have some cheese.
[389:47.33]I'm available to do it on the spot for no money.
[389:52.72]Alright, here we go.

[391:51.72]I'll miss you.
[391:52.28]P.S.
[391:52.56]My stomach exams show nothing out of the ordinary, but the pain I'm feeling is real as fuck.
[391:57.88]I know that life is annoying.
[392:01.07]They took a biopsy of my stomach.
[392:02.71]It might not be anything at all, but it might mean my pain might never go away.
[392:07.86]Sorry to hear that.
[392:09.74]That's never fun.
[392:13.46]Like I said earlier, I've had these fucking mystery symptoms for two years.
[392:18.08]No idea what it is.
[392:18.90]I knew I had colitis my whole life, essentially, the last at least 12 years or so.
[392:25.06]Like, I've known that.
[392:27.32]But when you have some new random medical problem that you cannot, nobody can actually tell you this is exactly what's wrong with you, it's a huge pain in the ass.
[392:42.62]What if you're allergic to something you're eating?
[392:43.98]I... It's not it.
[392:45.54]I had a full... I had a full allergy panel.
[392:48.59]So they tested for everything.
[392:51.35]Nothing.
[392:53.55]And sometimes you have to just kind of... You just kind of have to... Punch at it.
[392:58.39]While you just try to live your normal life.
[393:03.69]Just cast full heal on yourself, you dummy.
[393:06.40]I wish that... If that were real...
[393:11.10]Imagine you just cast Heal on yourself and just like, oh wow, I feel fucking perfect.
[393:20.09]But I try not to let this shit bother me.
[393:25.29]Because obviously, if it did, if I let it annoy me and irritate me and bother me all the time, then I would just be in a bad place where I would just be annoyed and miserable all the time.
[393:37.77]So I'm trying to look on the bright side and just be like, alright, I'm just going to keep going at it and just see what happens.
[393:49.16]And if it turns out that I have to go do this fucking injection into my nerve, I've gotta do it.
[393:58.83]Like, I'm gonna do it.
[394:01.23]Not at that point yet.
[394:06.65]We'll see.
[394:13.31]But I don't really like to... I mean, we talk about this kind of medical stuff sometimes, but I really don't like talking too much about it, only when I have to, because I don't want people to think that there's something wrong.
[394:27.09]Oh, he must be in pain right now streaming.
[394:29.86]Dude, stop streaming.
[394:31.10]What are you doing?
[394:31.48]Get out of here.
[394:31.88]It's like, I've said this before and I'll say it again.
[394:35.82]If I wasn't comfortable, which has happened before at least a handful of times, I just won't stream.
[394:41.72]I'll just tell you, hey, it's not happening today.
[394:44.18]Maybe tomorrow.
[394:45.22]That's happened at least a handful of times over the last few months.
[394:47.77]Of course it has.
[394:49.73]I'm not going to do that.
[394:52.51]So, don't worry about that.
[394:53.73]I'm not going to just stream and sit here and be in pain or anything like that.
[394:59.17]And that doesn't really happen that much anyways.
[395:00.57]It almost happened today.
[395:04.73]Yeah, but today was weird because it just kind of... I've never been in a scenario before where, okay, here's a new thing that might be... I pulled a muscle in my tongue somehow.
[395:18.23]It's still there.
[395:19.93]But this is exactly how it started when my chest and back started to hurt.
[395:26.31]It was just like, ow, this hurts.
[395:28.35]What's wrong?
[395:29.13]What is that?
[395:29.45]Did I just pull a muscle in my back?
[395:32.29]I must have.
[395:33.31]Oh, that's weird.
[395:33.73]That's not going away.
[395:35.49]Now this is there forever.
[395:36.83]Okay.
[395:37.33]Weird.
[395:37.77]Okay.
[395:38.99]Same exact scenario.
[395:41.63]So...
[395:45.27]It's almost like I'm on edge when it comes to stuff like that.
[395:49.55]So that's why I was giving a small, like, hey, I might leave in 10 minutes if this gets any worse.
[395:56.33]I just want to be, obviously want to make sure I'm okay, too.
[396:05.83]You kissed too hard.
[396:08.36]But at the same time, I also don't want to create some kind of...
[396:14.55]worry or panic in the community that, oh my god, something's wrong.
[396:18.01]He needs to go to the doctor right now.
[396:20.29]It's under control.
[396:22.25]Don't worry about me.
[396:23.79]I'm actively doing this shit every week.
[396:27.73]So don't worry about me.
[396:28.63]I'll be alright.
[396:34.18]And it's not... It's not that bad.
[396:39.26]It's annoying and I have to deal with it.
[396:42.83]But I'll be alright.
[396:45.43]I just don't want people to be worried about this shit.
[396:49.99]If I'm not worried about it, you shouldn't be either.
[396:53.29]Let's put it that way.
[396:55.63]Just keep going.
[396:59.13]You do have a pretty flexible job, luckily.
[397:01.13]Yeah.
[397:02.55]I do.
[397:03.85]And...
[397:07.40]Every day that I wake up, I go, holy fuck.
[397:11.82]I can actually say, no, I'm not doing it today.
[397:16.30]A lot of people aren't in that scenario.
[397:20.45]But I'm incredibly lucky.
[397:22.81]I am very, very, very much lucky for this.
[397:25.47]Because I know that if I was doing anything else, I can't just not go to fucking work.
[397:33.50]You know what I mean?
[397:34.32]You can't do that.
[397:37.30]I'm incredibly fucking lucky.
[397:49.75]Don't be extra hard on yourself because of your blessings and push yourself too far.
[397:53.73]No, no, no, no.
[397:54.65]Don't worry.
[397:57.02]I take time off.
[397:59.32]I just, I mean, we just made the, I was making the joke before, but I mean, I just took the last four days off.
[398:04.18]I'm alright.
[398:06.72]Don't worry.
[398:14.86]We know you're waiting tables.
[398:16.41]Shh, don't say anything about that.
[398:24.25]Unhint your jaw and... I would delete that if I could.
[398:29.23]I can't.
[398:30.09]I don't have access to my deletion.
[398:36.10]But, anyways.
[398:38.58]Don't want to get anybody concerned.
[398:41.62]If I'm not concerned, you shouldn't be either.
[398:44.81]Hey, let's move on to the fucking comedy!
[398:46.79]Yeah, I mean, gotta be careful, man.
[398:47.93]Listen, Jerma, I'm gonna be real with you.
[398:49.61]I clearly need more stickers, and I mean a lot more.
[398:51.75]When are you going to have your own vinyl stickers?
[398:54.57]I've been waiting so long.
[399:19.68]What is... Okay, one of your stickers is, I never leave Rhode Island.
[399:29.50]Seagulls are everywhere.
[399:31.04]Seagulls are everywhere.
[399:31.66]What else are these ones?
[399:36.17]Shark attack?
[399:42.93]Well, let's take a look at these.
[399:48.19]They're everywhere.
[399:49.31]Okay, I have a question.
[399:51.90]At what point does this become illegal?
[399:56.54]You know what I mean?
[399:57.60]I'm going to show this.
[399:58.42]When does this become illegal?
[400:10.13]Are you getting there?
[400:23.00]What are the laws on this type of shit?
[400:29.81]I can't see.
[400:30.25]I know.
[400:30.53]I'm just moving some stuff.
[400:36.27]Why is it so big?
[400:37.27]Jojo.
[400:39.69]Ow.
[400:43.78]I zoomed right in on the Jojo.
[400:58.00]Why can I... Why is this... Am I even resizing this fucking thing?
[401:07.07]Why is this never ending?
[401:08.79]Okay, so... I see you have sands back there.
[401:28.10]What else you got?
[401:28.94]Like a skunk?
[401:33.63]Oh yeah, but at what point do you get pulled over for this?
[401:37.61]They're everywhere!
[401:41.43]Your car has sticker acne!
[401:48.85]This is if Reddit was a car.
[402:03.54]What does this one say?
[402:05.60]Bitch, I'm going oo-you-oo mode?
[402:12.71]Ban this guy.
[402:13.51]I can... What is this car?
[402:20.40]Alright.
[402:21.12]Cool car.
[402:23.14]Ow.
[402:31.47]Bitch, I'm going.
[402:33.67]I don't even know what that means.
[402:34.63]I'm not going to ban somebody if I have a Reddit car.
[402:41.65]I don't even know what that means.
[402:45.99]Say it right.
[402:46.95]How am I supposed to say something right that I've never heard in my life?
[402:59.70]Uh, when am I gonna have my own stickers?
[403:02.21]Oh.
[403:04.53]Um, I don't know.
[403:06.69]Maybe someday.
[403:08.69]Who knows if that's ever actually gonna happen.
[403:11.93]I have no idea.
[403:12.97]There's all kinds of things that I want to do.
[403:26.04]There's all kinds of things that I want to do.
[403:28.66]But I got to focus on one thing at a time.
[403:32.20]Where's the background music?
[403:33.24]Oh, whoops.
[403:38.78]There you go.
[403:43.18]But we'll move on.
[403:46.39]I can't tell you when or if it would happen.
[403:48.39]Hey, this is Esquilo13 for the 250.
[403:50.43]Hello, jerk, but this is Nintendo calling.
[403:52.43]We want you to explain this video.
[403:55.47]Uh... But for reals.
[403:57.43]Most of my edits got deleted on Community Content Night like this one and this one.
[404:04.08]Yeah, there's gonna probably... As much as I don't want to say this, I think I should...
[404:14.06]that there are so many submissions to Community Content Night that I cannot show every single submission anymore.
[404:27.65]There are sometimes month to month hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of submissions.
[404:39.24]And at first, when people first started to figure out, oh, we're just gonna put whatever in, it'll just get on stream, whatever, that's cool.
[404:46.92]But going forward, there's gonna have to be some type of, some type of, like, initial kind of content filter, I guess, and show things selectively, and just because of the amount of submissions, there's just so many.
[405:03.48]And I really don't want to do a case where, which it's not like I felt it happening in any of the other ones, but so let's say for instance, either the, the community content streams, they're all, they're all between four and the last one was what four and a half hours.
[405:19.10]They're between like four and five hours.
[405:21.36]And I'd like to maybe instead of have those potentially go even higher to like six plus hours.
[405:31.60]We got to start to... Because I don't want to just skip through them.
[405:35.72]Oh, I know that we're going to be here for six and a half hours going through artwork and edits and stuff.
[405:40.82]So look at that one.
[405:41.57]Oh, that one's kind of cool.
[405:42.53]Look at this one.
[405:43.09]And then look at that one.
[405:43.85]And then this one.
[405:44.61]And oh, that one's pretty cool.
[405:45.85]Look at the line work.
[405:46.81]Oh, this one.
[405:48.33]Essentially, you have to channel surf quickly.
[405:51.21]Otherwise, you'll be there for 10 hours.
[405:54.47]So at this point, probably going forward...
[405:58.72]There's gonna be at least a base level of sort of selectively choosing what goes on to the stream.
[406:04.58]And that's not to say that everything's gonna just, oh wow, now there's only gonna be like 15 pieces of artwork and it's only gonna be the fucking insane ones that took people like six weeks to make.
[406:15.11]No.
[406:16.15]But there'll be at least a base filter where we try to shave it down a little.
[406:25.87]But that's kind of where that stands.
[406:32.06]That's where that stands.
[406:36.64]No meme generator type stuff.
[406:40.65]Originally, Photoshop were in there.
[406:44.67]They could be funny and they could be fun.
[406:47.21]But, I don't know.
[406:48.81]It's tough.
[406:49.59]It's tough to try to put some kind of filter on it.
[406:55.55]Still trying to figure that out.
[406:58.14]Now show the frogs again.
[406:59.58]Oh, I accidentally did.
[407:01.44]Wait.
[407:02.70]Oh, this.
[407:09.48]Why is it not here?
[407:10.02]I'm trying to show the frogs.
[407:14.35]I'm clicking on them.
[407:15.07]Why?
[407:15.31]I don't know.
[407:15.69]They're not showing.
[407:16.27]Why can I not show the frogs?
[407:27.90]They should be on the screen right now.
[407:30.46]Oh, there they are.
[407:39.30]Wait, did big money just come in?
[407:41.54]Another $50 from Phylactery.
[407:46.79]All these red numbers.
[407:48.95]Holy shit, guys.
[407:50.61]Phylactery, another 5,000 bits.
[407:52.19]Give me a fucking Jerma.
[407:53.61]Jerm plus you streamer-y.
[407:58.86]$50 from Core Monster.
[408:00.96]If you don't do Pachinko first thing tomorrow, I'm going to scream.
[408:03.46]I will.
[408:03.72]I'll beat it first thing tomorrow.
[408:05.98]Maybe.
[408:12.88]Re-ResidentSleeper.
[408:15.25]But thanks, both of you.
[408:16.07]That's a lot of fucking money.
[408:17.33]You guys give a lot of money.
[408:19.77]A lot.
[408:21.83]I appreciate it.
[408:24.79]Anyways, let's keep going.
[408:26.45]Let's go to LM Man for 500 bits.
[408:28.96]$5 from LM Man.
[408:30.10]Jerma, when are you going to do Viva Pinata?
[408:33.74]Probably not this week, because I really want to get Mario Sunshine done.
[408:38.76]And if we do Mario Sunshine for the next three or four straight days, between like six to seven-ish hours per stream, six to eight hours a stream, I would assume, for Mario Sunshine, that's talking...
[408:53.65]How long is Mario Sunshine?
[408:54.55]Like 20 hours?
[408:55.99]25 hours?
[408:57.67]But I'm not just beating the game.
[408:58.94]I'm obviously doing a lot of the extra stuff as he's seen today.
[409:04.36]Doing like six to eight shines in each level is going to take how long?
[409:09.45]What do you guys say?
[409:15.51]Not 100% of the game, but I'd say like how long would like 70% of the game take?
[409:24.54]18 hours.
[409:27.00]I don't know.
[409:27.34]I only watch speedruns of it.
[409:30.26]Average run is like 16 hours.
[409:31.59]Okay.
[409:35.99]Alright, well.
[409:37.45]We'll see.
[409:38.71]The whole stream, all the content, 15-20 hours.
[409:41.27]That makes sense then.
[409:44.52]Yeah, that's... That would be like 3-ish, 4-ish streams.
[409:49.06]Sounds good to me.
[409:51.60]But there's not going to be any time.
[409:52.63]And then community content night is right after that.
[409:58.61]There will not be any time for anything else this week.
[410:00.81]We'll have to do it next week.
[410:05.38]Any percent.
[410:06.00]As long as you're not doing full blue coins, it should be good.
[410:11.68]Nah, I'll probably... I just get them when I see them.
[410:15.60]Hey Atrolox Atrix, thanks for the thousand bits.
[410:17.66]First you played my childhood game, Tony Hawk's Underground.
[410:20.60]Now you're playing my childhood game, Sunshine.
[410:22.42]I love you so much, thanks.
[410:24.02]Also, what was the hardest mission during tonight's stream?
[410:28.15]Um... Probably one of the jump on the rotating cubes.
[410:33.37]Secret levels.
[410:35.75]Pachinko's not hard.
[410:37.46]I mean, it's just... Dumb.
[410:40.34]It's not...
[410:42.18]That level's not hard.
[410:43.92]It's just stupid.
[410:44.90]And I mean stupid as in... Not that I don't think it's any fun.
[410:49.08]It's just like... You just launch Mario with a spring in a pachinko machine.
[410:54.37]It's just... It's stupid.
[410:56.93]It's not bad.
[410:58.19]It's just stupid.
[411:00.19]Mad because bad.
[411:00.93]No, no.
[411:01.39]It's not bad.
[411:02.85]It's just stupid.
[411:04.75]If you saw, if I was, if this was a green screen edit of me flying around at a pachinko machine, you'd be like, well, that's, this is pretty stupid.
[411:11.02]You'd probably think it was cool.
[411:12.58]I would.
[411:12.88]Somebody get on that.
[411:16.18]Thanks, Atrolux, for the thousand bits.
[411:21.99]Ten bucks.
[411:22.41]Appreciate it.
[411:24.36]It'll probably be right at the very end.
[411:26.68]That'll be the last thing that we do.
[411:28.52]Nobody wants to open a stream like that.
[411:30.66]That's gonna be the last thing that I do.
[411:31.90]I'm gonna sit there for 30 minutes and just stare at the camera.
[411:55.30]That's gonna be a wicked, creepy, awkward fucking stream.
[411:59.37]I'm gonna lose fans from that stream.
[412:04.12]Whatever.
[412:04.42]I gotta rip the band-aid off.
[412:10.48]Welcome.
[412:11.18]Welcome to the stream.
[412:12.16]Hope you enjoyed it.
[412:13.08]Maybe we'll see you again soon.
[412:14.06]Thanks a lot, NotPrior.
[412:38.21]No one ever beat this game.
[412:39.09]I don't think so.
[412:39.51]It's Mario.
[412:39.85]Yeah, maybe you're right.
[412:40.55]I've seen it a couple times.
[413:08.37]I wasn't even getting mad.
[413:09.33]I was just... I mean, these levels are fun and interesting enough.
[413:12.47]And it's really easy to start them over again.
[413:14.25]They just said the game is stupid.
[413:21.77]But in a good way.
[413:22.49]Hey, Mr. Kool-Aid, thanks for the thousand bits.
[413:25.71]Jerma, would you enable feels, dance, or alien, please?
[413:28.90]It would help me express myself more honestly in chat.
[413:31.92]Thanks for the consideration.
[413:32.88]Thanks for the good times.
[413:35.00]You're welcome, Mr. Kool-Aid.
[413:36.18]And... I don't know, maybe...
[413:39.21]Enable POG.
[413:39.93]No, I want to be able to read it.
[413:40.83]I don't want to enable POG.
[413:42.38]I want to read POG.
[413:45.40]Josh, thanks for the 500 bits.
[413:47.06]You should play Mario Kart Double Dash.
[413:48.54]It's a pretty solid Mario Kart game.
[413:54.37]What you meant to say was the last good Mario Kart game.
[414:00.21]I'll say it.
[414:01.09]I know.
[414:01.61]You don't have to.
[414:02.09]I will.
[414:06.02]I'll say it.
[414:10.66]Everybody, 2,500 people here are all thinking it.
[414:13.98]I'll be the one to say it.
[414:15.94]Let me take the flag for this.
[414:18.81]Not you.
[414:19.87]I'll take it.
[414:30.96]uh no but the wii one the wii one I remember this is before I guys this is before I had a Twitch channel a youtube channel I played the wii one and I fucking hated it I remember playing it and just being like oh the new Mario Kart and being like I fucking hate this thing
[414:55.75]What?
[414:56.19]I'm in first place.
[414:57.01]I'm in second place.
[414:57.97]Why do I get hit?
[414:58.49]Why do I get hit with a blue shell again?
[415:00.14]Every time I get into first place.
[415:01.10]Just don't go in first place.
[415:02.28]Ever.
[415:04.38]Only be in fourth place until the last ten seconds of the race.
[415:09.38]Why are these in the game?
[415:10.56]Why does this exist?
[415:12.59]Because the asshole in ninth place is just going to troll people in the first two places?
[415:16.15]This is stupid and I'd fucking never play it again.
[415:29.91]It's a matter of balance.
[415:33.63]That's how all of them work.
[415:34.49]Not all of them.
[415:35.87]Not all of them.
[415:42.14]I need to make it fair so people in last can catch up.
[415:47.26]Well... But maybe the people in last place shouldn't have driven into the wall ten times.
[415:53.93]When you pass... When you laptoed a third time...
[415:58.47]Is it Toad?
[416:00.72]Like Toad, when you lap Toad for a third time, should Toad get a shell to throw at you in first place?
[416:12.61]Like Toad, just like pull over.
[416:14.93]Toad, pull over and cheer from the side at that point, Toad.
[416:19.76]Come on.
[416:27.75]Toad deserves it.
[416:28.99]Sherva's a dick.
[416:33.23]What?
[416:33.57]We're talking about Mario Kart.
[416:37.40]This is Mario Kart here.
[416:39.92]We're not talking about, like, life.
[416:44.64]Sherva, that's... You hate... No, no.
[416:48.84]Hey, we're talking about Mario Kart.
[416:50.40]We're talking about passing Toad three times.
[416:53.76]And you get hit with a turtle shell.
[416:56.12]Because on your third time passing him, he accidentally pressed the fucking A button in the right way and hit you with a green shell.
[417:20.95]Everyone loves Mario Kart unless you're inherently evil.
[417:26.11]I don't think so.
[417:27.55]I don't think it makes you evil to be sick of Toad in the fucking back throwing blue shells at you.
[417:37.03]He's a villain.
[417:41.34]I can't be evil.
[417:42.58]I can't be evil.
[417:48.14]He's got something against Toad.
[417:49.34]No, okay, but still.
[417:54.16]Alright, how many?
[417:55.04]Put the music on.
[417:56.75]How many times have you... It's a fucking video game.
[417:59.29]It's my free time.
[418:00.51]If I'm going to be in first place in a video game in my free time, I would like to stay in first place.
[418:04.81]Unless I do something wrong.
[418:07.89]And if I'm going to pass Toad five times.
[418:12.37]I paid for this game.
[418:13.21]It was $60.
[418:17.92]I'm at the finish line, and I get hit with a bullet bill and a blue shell, and now I'm in seventh place.
[418:24.06]And I gotta read through the level.
[418:25.04]Every spy paid $60 for this game.
[418:31.80]You beat, you're beating up a, you're beating a kid.
[418:33.82]Toad's like, Toad's like, yeah, what are you talking about?
[418:45.92]Toad's in his, like, late 30s.
[418:54.93]If you're in first the whole race, it's boring.
[418:56.90]If that's where you took a wrong turn, you paid $60 for a video game.
[419:21.31]He definitely raged at somebody, like, Wii online or something.
[419:25.81]No, I know that's what some of you guys are thinking.
[419:27.79]He must be so bitter for Mario Kart Wii, because it was the first time Nintendo even tried to do online.
[419:35.49]Oh, and by the way, there's a new Mario Kart for the iPad.
[419:40.18]I did not know this until it was brought to my attention.
[419:45.72]That game's not online.
[419:47.16]You're playing against bots.
[419:48.68]I thought it was online.
[419:54.61]They give them flags and names and... Some of the names are in different languages and shit.
[420:06.09]It's just like they're pretending that they're people playing.
[420:16.59]I bet he lost.
[420:17.37]I did!
[420:17.70]Because I got hit with a blue shell in the first place like five times.
[420:22.00]I'm in first place and he's leaving me alone.
[420:26.02]Best place to be in Mario Kart is in third place.
[420:33.25]This is why you're mad.
[420:36.35]Old people fall for so many scams.
[420:43.97]It used to be like an old pastime of mine.
[420:46.77]To see how many times I could pass Toad in Super Mario Kart for Super Nintendo on the Bowser level.
[420:54.88]You could do it six or seven potential plus times.
[421:00.24]That was the game.
[421:01.64]It wasn't about how many times I could win the race.
[421:05.24]It was, I need to pass Toad eight times this time.
[421:18.42]Am I psycho?
[421:19.44]Does this make me like a psychopath?
[421:21.87]Does this make me a psycho?
[421:27.77]Huh.
[421:29.09]Okay.
[421:30.65]I'll bring this to the doctor.
[421:32.23]Be like, hey, what do you think about this?
[421:34.55]Oh, hey, here comes the time to pretend to be the doctor.
[421:37.27]Aw, fuck toad, that guy sucks.
[421:39.55]By the way, let's take a look at... I'm not doing it.
[421:52.43]Anyways, what was it?
[421:53.03]Oh yeah, play Mario Kart Double Dash.
[421:54.49]Yeah, maybe I will.
[421:55.55]It's a good one.
[421:56.03]Are there blue shells in Double Dash?
[421:59.71]I don't remember.
[422:01.21]When did they introduce the blue shell?
[422:03.65]Alright, I gotta move the fuck on.
[422:05.05]I gotta stop this.
[422:07.91]But it was like a 1% drop, wasn't it?
[422:20.42]Okay, I'm done.
[422:23.05]Pugles, thanks for the 400 bits.
[422:24.55]Hey, Jim.
[422:25.99]Just wanted to throw some money at you as I vent about how I was just at McDonald's drive-thru at 3am and they were cleaning their deep fryers so like half the menu was unavailable and it ruined my plans for the night.
[422:36.72]Anyways, here's a short video.
[422:40.82]I don't click videos anymore, but I'll click it.
[422:47.28]We don't click videos anymore on this channel.
[422:49.82]I get gnomed and ear blasted.
[422:54.60]How many times?
[422:56.83]Hopefully it's too dangerous.
[423:02.43]I'll check it out though.
[423:03.13]Let's check it out.
[423:05.75]This is Oblivion NPC conversation.
[423:17.52]Where's your AMD?
[423:20.16]My dick?
[423:21.73]Your DM.
[423:24.15]You trying to slide in the DMs?
[423:25.29]You trying to slide in the DMs?
[423:28.41]What the fuck are you talking about?
[423:32.77]You know Twitter?
[423:35.37]Yep.
[423:38.01]What the hell is this?
[423:49.56]Oblivion Conversations.
[423:53.39]Oh.
[423:55.07]Okay.
[423:55.69]Well, thanks for that video.
[423:59.73]That wasn't you, right?
[424:03.19]Thanks a lot, Jim.
[424:05.17]Well, your name, you know, hey, Jim.
[424:06.64]That's not my name either.
[424:08.24]It's neither one of our names, probably.
[424:10.46]Thanks for the $4.
[424:11.24]Hey, Pixel Otter, thanks for the 400 bits.
[424:13.76]Genius, kind angel, baby streamer Jerma.
[424:19.36]Thanks for the $4.
[424:21.68]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50.
[424:23.63]I'm excited to hear that you're going to play the Battle for Bikini Bottom remake.
[424:27.25]I kind of want to see you play the original.
[424:28.57]Maybe it's just nostalgia talking.
[424:31.25]But I feel like that'll be a better version.
[424:32.87]Whatever the case, it'll be a fun stream.
[424:36.09]Well, I mean, here's the 500 IQ play here from me.
[424:40.85]Um... Jerma only plays games before 2010.
[424:44.09]But... But... What if that game is a remake of a game from 2006?
[424:51.84]Comes out in 2020.
[424:54.40]That means that's a new game?
[424:59.20]New game?
[425:03.33]Hmm.
[425:04.19]Cool.
[425:08.12]Thank you to Polly Hex for 10 community subs just a few minutes ago.
[425:14.64]No, it was two hours ago.
[425:17.70]More than a few minutes.
[425:19.08]A few more minutes after that.
[425:20.63]Thanks for the 10 subs.
[425:24.83]Appreciate it.
[425:26.71]Thanks for tossing some in here.
[425:28.63]Bug Smoke, thanks for 300 bits.
[425:30.33]Hey, Jeremiah, if you spray water in front of you and slide on it, you get really good speed boost.
[425:35.28]I figured that out eventually.
[425:36.44]Thank you, though.
[425:36.90]Appreciate the tip.
[425:38.88]Seven layer Wario.
[425:39.78]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[425:40.94]I yell at the TV when you fuck up the same way other people yell at sports.
[425:51.94]He dropped it.
[425:53.00]Oh, what the fuck?
[425:54.72]I can't fucking believe you.
[425:56.48]I'm not in competition with anybody.
[426:01.12]Why is this so much at stake?
[426:06.19]There's not two people in here playing Mario Sunshine at the same time to see who can beat it first.
[426:14.96]It's me, like, sitting in my chair, relaxing, playing Mario Sunshine.
[426:18.98]This is not like a football game.
[426:20.68]Just betting on my gameplay.
[426:23.98]I don't condone that.
[426:24.76]That's nothing that I did.
[426:32.50]Doesn't know.
[426:34.24]Bad call.
[426:35.04]Fire that guy.
[426:39.08]Well, I hope you don't lose any money.
[426:41.06]Keith King Crimson, thanks for the $2.50.
[426:42.92]Fun fact, under two Pantismos mask, he looks like the running guy from Ocarina of Time.
[426:57.83]Is it the same character?
[426:58.71]I don't know.
[427:01.41]Could be.
[427:04.07]marry me Jerma nope sorry put Germany and he doesn't have the reach well normally that's the kind of comment that would get you timed out for at least six to seven days but it's clever I'll reduce your sentence by one day see you in five days
[427:40.00]No, no, not because I'm banning anybody.
[427:42.65]I'm just not streaming for five days.
[427:43.85]I'll see you in like a week.
[427:45.19]See you in like six days.
[427:51.37]Let's get the credits rolling.
[427:52.23]What do you say?
[427:52.73]I knew it.
[428:04.37]He won't stream because of one guy.
[428:06.43]The all-powerful
[428:09.87]The all-powerful one.
[428:10.95]Ah, I'm going to hit you here.
[428:12.89]Sorry.
[428:18.16]Ah, here they are.
[428:18.86]Here come the subs.
[428:20.18]There were a lot of them, as you can see.
[428:24.68]Lots of people subscribed.
[428:26.36]Lots of people community subbed.
[428:27.92]Lots of people just decided they were going to sub for the first time today, right now.
[428:32.64]Whoever you are.
[428:33.60]Thank you.
[428:36.54]Appreciate it.
[428:39.59]I really do.
[428:42.45]Much love to y'all.
[428:44.23]Dodged them all.
[428:44.95]Damn.
[428:46.15]Write that guy's name down.
[428:49.33]By the way, I haven't written down any of these people's names.
[428:51.56]Hopefully people did.
[428:57.34]Hey, JermaSuck, speaking of subs, you gave 10 community subs earlier.
[429:02.42]Thank you.
[429:04.75]Uh, NV11Casting, thanks for the $2.50.
[429:08.29]My favorite streamer is playing my favorite childhood game, and my Taco Bell delivery guy gave me like 40 sauce packets.
[429:15.26]This is the happiest I've been in weeks.
[429:17.06]People happy.
[429:18.46]Well, honestly, thank you for being you, Jerma.
[429:19.92]You've been a great help through the past few months of college stress.
[429:23.60]That's a lot of packets.
[429:26.39]Thanks for the $2.50.
[429:27.79]Enjoy your Taco Bell.
[429:29.11]Hopefully it was good.
[429:29.79]Hopefully it was filling and fulfilling.
[429:35.26]Oh, whoa.
[429:36.76]Alright.
[429:37.60]This is mine.
[429:39.14]That's like a restaurant.
[429:40.34]If you go to a restaurant and then it's at the end of your meal and the waiter or waitress comes over, they say at the very end, you sign the check and they go, thanks for coming.
[429:51.10]I hope your meal was... Hold on.
[429:54.04]Um, thanks for coming.
[429:55.32]Yep, appreciate it.
[429:56.46]Thank you for the, uh, yeah, your card.
[429:57.86]I'll run it.
[429:58.64]I hope your meal was fulling.
[430:00.04]I can't, uh, thanks for the card.
[430:02.46]I hope your meal was filling and fulfilling.
[430:05.24]See you next time, hopefully.
[430:06.44]There it is.
[430:06.72]That's mine.
[430:08.08]When I open up my restaurant.
[430:10.73]Booker burgers.
[430:11.71]Just wipe their fucking nose all over the buns and shit and spit on all the hamburgers.
[430:19.47]Hey, yo, it's Mike.
[430:21.49]Thanks for the ten bucks?
[430:27.87]And also from you, it's Mike.
[430:28.83]Dermot, thanks for playing this awesome classic games.
[430:33.01]Hope you can chill with some more with Viva Pinata.
[430:35.33]Yeah, I will.
[430:39.32]I had a lot of fun playing it.
[430:41.24]Definitely something I'll do.
[430:48.82]You will see it again.
[430:57.30]Hope your meal was filling and fulfilling.
[431:00.80]Stupid fucking idiot.
[431:01.92]Fucking goddamn dumb fucking idiot.
[431:07.10]You better leave at least 40%.
[431:09.21]See you next- Hup!
[431:16.09]Come back soon!
[431:23.53]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[431:24.79]My god, Jerma.
[431:27.43]I love you and I never send mean bits, but god damn man, what the fuck are you doing?
[431:34.35]You're triggering me with your play style right now.
[431:36.97]I'm a Mario fan and this is the end of the line for me.
[431:40.50]I'm un-suffering.
[431:44.66]What?
[431:44.92]I'm not even playing that poorly.
[431:46.56]I'm playing like a normal human plays video games.
[431:51.07]What?
[431:51.33]Okay.
[431:52.35]I'm a normal human.
[431:54.99]enjoying a video game on an old elderly console.
[432:00.39]What's wrong?
[432:01.21]He's playing like shit.
[432:05.30]I'm playing just fine.
[432:08.36]I'm playing just fine.
[432:11.82]Goiki, thanks for the 500 bits.
[432:13.14]I only caught the final pachinko moment of the stream, but I'm excited to watch more of this game when I don't have standardized testing on a stream day.
[432:19.73]Maybe we'll see you tomorrow.
[432:27.09]You did great on the water.
[432:28.11]People like to tend to forget about the watermelon level that I just did.
[432:32.70]I did that in less than 10-15 minutes.
[432:34.90]I know for a fact that took you at least 6 hours when you were a kid.
[432:40.48]I get credit for the watermelon level, I do.
[432:46.57]Uh, thank you, Hemmerroid, for the five, uh, Heim, Heimroid, Heim, Heimroid, what?
[432:55.59]Thanks for the Heim, thanks for the 500 bits.
[433:00.14]Hey, Jerma, I'm going to Boston in April to hang out with friends.
[433:02.38]Are there any places I absolutely need to visit while I'm here?
[433:05.04]I remember you mentioning an arcade party place, but I don't remember the name.
[433:08.36]That would be Jillian's.
[433:10.86]Jillian's is great.
[433:12.84]Jillian's has two or three floors.
[433:14.28]There's a full bowling alley.
[433:15.78]There's a full arcade.
[433:16.68]There's a bar in there.
[433:18.65]Jillian's is kind of like Dave and Buster's, but not a meme.
[433:22.93]If that makes any sense.
[433:30.05]Oh, go to the Hash House of Go-Go.
[433:38.02]That doesn't exist.
[433:38.86]Sorry.
[433:46.22]What's with you guys and Reddit?
[433:47.38]Dave and Buster's is a Reddit restaurant.
[433:49.38]Well, I don't know.
[433:51.50]Somebody has a Reddit car.
[433:52.62]Somebody has a Reddit restaurant.
[433:54.14]Somebody has a Reddit dog food.
[433:57.21]Somebody has a Reddit coffee.
[434:00.21]What else is there?
[434:06.77]Reddit streamer.
[434:08.07]I'm not a Reddit streamer.
[434:11.05]I'm just a regular streamer.
[434:13.09]I'm not a Reddit streamer.
[434:19.76]I found you through Reddit.
[434:20.82]Yeah, but you found me through Reddit.
[434:22.18]I'm not like... Guys, I have a Reddit account.
[434:25.54]I think I've posted it three times.
[434:27.54]My Reddit account's name is Jerma's One Reddit Post.
[434:31.74]That's my actual account name.
[434:34.92]I actually... I did like one post.
[434:38.76]I was responding to somebody and I use it sometimes to talk to people in the community.
[434:43.04]I think I've written three times in ten years.
[434:47.89]Why would you admit to having a Reddit?
[434:51.93]I've used it like three, I don't know, I've used it like three, I've used it like three times.
[435:04.82]No, whatever, it's a fucking website.
[435:07.06]It's like, Reddit is like number four, and it's like real close.
[435:12.30]Maybe two or three points off from Pornhub at number three, okay?
[435:15.85]So it's like one of the world's most visited websites.
[435:18.55]What do you want me to do?
[435:26.71]He's going, here he goes.
[435:27.73]He's gonna be defensive.
[435:28.91]No, I'm not.
[435:29.73]I'm going.
[435:30.51]I'm out of here.
[435:36.60]Wait, Jillian's in Boston was turned into a lucky strike.
[435:40.50]What?
[435:42.84]What?
[435:43.84]Wait, Jillian doesn't exist anywhere anymore.
[435:46.29]What?
[435:47.43]Is it good?
[435:47.83]Is it still good?
[435:52.88]Is it good still?
[435:53.68]Is it still fun?
[435:54.22]Do they still have an arcade?
[435:55.48]They still have an arcade, though, right?
[435:56.60]Like, the third floor?
[436:04.49]What time is the stream tomorrow?
[436:05.75]Uh, between 2 o'clock and, like, 3 o'clock.
[436:08.20]2-ish, 3-ish.
[436:10.42]2, like, 30, 2.40, 2.20.
[436:11.16]I don't know.
[436:11.92]Between 2 and 3.
[436:12.32]2 o'clock, 3 o'clock.
[436:12.86]One of those.
[436:22.54]PM.
[436:25.77]Hey, Gooberry Juice, thanks for the $2.50.
[436:27.31]Well, Jerma, it finally happened.
[436:28.33]I had a dream with you in it.
[436:29.69]Alright, and here we go again.
[436:32.27]Stop eating McDonald's 10 minutes before you go to sleep.
[436:35.13]I dreamed I was meeting up with a couple of old friends in a New York bar.
[436:38.65]The weird part was that you were doing stand-up comedy at this random New York bar.
[436:43.12]And I didn't know if it's because I don't have a good mental cognition of what you look like from the neck down, but you were, like, really fat.
[436:51.96]Like, failed high school soccer coach fat.
[436:56.26]People were going up to the stage you were on throughout your routine, and dropping donations in this little Easter basket you had.
[437:05.29]Your stand-up was alright, by the way, if you're curious, it was just inside jokes from the stream.
[437:10.89]Anyway, at the end of your stand-up, you read off the donations, most of which were like, who are you?
[437:17.85]I went up to you after and asked what you were doing in New York, and you just started crying.
[437:22.22]He told me Otto died recently and this is the only way you could cope with it.
[437:25.98]I'm sad.
[437:26.68]I said I'm sorry for you.
[437:28.30]Then I woke up.
[437:29.96]What the fuck?
[437:32.57]What the fuck?
[437:34.07]This is fucking horrible.
[437:37.09]Oh, I'm sorry, dude.
[437:38.55]What are you doing in New York?
[437:39.97]I'm sorry, man.
[437:42.01]Otto died.
[437:44.24]So I went to New York to be a stand-up comedian.
[437:53.29]Jesus Christ.
[437:55.42]And got pretty fat, by the way.
[437:58.02]And people were just coming up on the stage.
[438:03.34]Well... Well, thanks.
[438:10.12]Weird.
[438:10.68]Hey, Gen Pendulum, thanks for the 300 bits.
[438:13.18]Hey, Jerma, I know you said you don't like D&D, but I would really like you to actually roleplay.
[438:17.26]Have you looked into other tabletop RPG systems?
[438:21.00]I just, I don't, I'm not out for it.
[438:23.26]I came to a realization a long time ago.
[438:25.90]I don't have the patience for it.
[438:27.76]Ugh, fuck.
[438:28.28]Hello.
[438:28.98]Hello.
[438:29.46]Hello.
[438:29.94]Hello.
[438:30.63]Hello!
[438:32.13]Hello!
[438:32.47]Alright, we're good.
[438:37.87]Thanks for the gold.
[438:39.09]Stop.
[438:42.39]No, it doesn't grab me.
[438:45.22]I lose my patience with it.
[438:46.96]I lose interest in it.
[438:48.62]I've tried to do it a couple times before, and it just didn't click.
[438:58.34]Well, and I will say that I do respect D&D, because it's the reason why we have skill trees, and it's the reason why any RPGs even exist in the first place.
[439:06.33]Almost all video games are because those guys made Dungeons & Dragons.
[439:10.96]Like, all video games are because of it.
[439:13.10]So, I highly respect it.
[439:19.43]That's a Reddit silver-worthy comment.
[439:21.41]Thanks.
[439:22.73]You don't thank somebody for silver, though.
[439:24.47]That's like... Thanks for the silver, I guess.
[439:27.23]Where's the gold, huh?
[439:29.05]Silver?
[439:29.85]Ah, cool.
[439:30.41]You don't even reply to that.
[439:31.53]You don't edit your comment for silver.
[439:42.04]I think that's taking it too far.
[439:48.58]How would you know?
[439:49.28]I'm just guessing.
[439:53.19]That's how people do things.
[439:54.85]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[439:59.79]Get some sleep.
[440:00.67]That's incorrect.
[440:02.69]So is this.
[440:04.84]So is that.
[440:06.88]So is this.
[440:08.58]So is... Okay, now, there we go.
[440:10.26]Found it.
[440:11.60]Nope.
[440:12.18]There it is.
[440:12.60]Okay, goodbye.
[440:15.53]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[440:16.55]More Super Mario Sunshine.
[440:17.87]I'm gonna go, um... Rest my tongue.
[440:21.95]And be annoyed.
[440:24.56]But, see you tomorrow.
[440:26.52]We have a couple more bits.
[440:27.16]We have just B for 250.
[440:29.04]How is the... How in the isity heck do you get 75,000 channel points?
[440:33.55]I want the power to make my favorite diaper joke master wink at my fingertips.
[440:37.81]Well, don't worry, because as of this weekend, you're only going to need half of those.
[440:50.77]Uh, by the way, if you are subscribed, you get, like, double points or something, don't you?
[440:55.47]Yeah.
[440:55.65]Something like that.
[440:59.97]Thanks a lot, though.
[441:00.57]And finally, PeacefulHaley, thanks for the $2.50.
[441:02.43]I gave you $50 when I told you I was going to Vegas, and all you had to say was, Go to Hash House or GoGo, which you've said 50 times to us.
[441:08.83]And Jillian's is permanently closed.
[441:10.31]Omega low.
[441:10.95]What the fuck?
[441:16.95]Yeah, I know.
[441:18.43]And I said go to Gordon Ramsay Steak.
[441:20.53]Gordon Ramsay Steak is awesome.
[441:26.72]Gordon Ramsay Steak is the other restaurant I would say to go to.
[441:30.90]Or Carson Kitchen in downtown.
[441:34.94]You know, to be real with you, Carson Kitchen in downtown is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.
[441:37.84]It's a new one.
[441:45.89]That's a new one.
[441:47.70]And also, here's the thing.
[441:48.86]Vegas, there's so much you could... There's so many reasons why people come to Vegas that it's hard to give exact things that you should do.
[441:56.77]Some people come to Vegas with five grand and they blow it in the casinos.
[442:01.17]It's like, oh, did you... Do you gamble?
[442:03.49]I mean...
[442:05.63]If you do, I'm not telling you to, but, you know, don't do that.
[442:09.21]Be careful.
[442:10.53]But, Cosmopolitan and the Aria are two of the best casinos and resorts in Vegas on the Strip.
[442:18.26]If you, are you hungry?
[442:20.18]It's got some of the best restaurants in the world.
[442:21.50]Do you like hiking?
[442:22.90]Do you like skiing?
[442:23.74]It has everything.
[442:32.90]Just depends on what you want to do.
[442:34.96]You want to go see a bunch of shows.
[442:36.00]There are some good shows.
[442:38.22]Penn and Teller.
[442:40.31]Him and I saw Penn and Teller.
[442:41.69]It was pretty good.
[442:42.97]They still got it.
[442:43.57]It's still a fun, interesting show.
[442:55.46]It was like half magic, half stage magic, half commentary from Penn, and it was pretty cool.
[443:04.48]It was really, like, it was a nice show.
[443:06.91]We'll put it that way.
[443:09.11]It wasn't sarcastic, but I love Penn and Telly.
[443:14.93]Is Jermis' voice pitch-shifted?
[443:16.39]Um, no.
[443:18.23]You're probably noticing I'm talking a little differently because my throat is kind of fucked up for some reason.
[443:26.21]Wait.
[443:26.69]I don't have my effects turned on.
[443:32.44]You went up five octaves.
[443:33.76]What?
[443:34.04]No, I did.
[443:34.42]How?
[443:38.68]Anyways, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[443:40.80]Have a great rest of your night.
[443:44.42]High low rent for the rest of this trip.
[443:49.13]Thank you all so much.
[443:50.79]I really appreciate it.
[443:54.19]I just want to say...
[443:57.07]But, they don't, obviously, all the support of all the other people.
[444:02.77]Here, right now, we wouldn't be the first order.
[444:06.05]I wouldn't have any reason to try to, I don't want to give spoilers on the recent Star Wars movie.
[444:15.54]But, as you know, I just want to say that I...
[444:23.93]Thank you.
[444:58.83]It would sit and think, uh, why the fuck is that sky blue?
[445:08.00]It would just dream that the sky was green instead.
[445:12.64]Or the sky was red.
[445:13.94]What if the sky
[445:31.91]2D!
[445:33.95]2D!
[445:35.37]2D!
[445:35.93]Is this better?
[445:38.36]Is that better?
[445:40.44]Okay.
[445:41.30]That's better?
[445:42.16]Did you guys actually hear it now?
[445:44.22]Okay, that's good.
[445:45.70]Let's go.
[445:46.10]Let's reset to 1.
[445:47.14]Reset to 1, guys.
[445:48.38]Okay, reset to 1.
[445:49.66]Right at the sky.
[445:52.89]Alright, I'm fine.
[445:55.29]I'll see you tomorrow.
[445:56.35]Bye.
[446:08.29]you
[446:38.20]oh oh oh oh oh
