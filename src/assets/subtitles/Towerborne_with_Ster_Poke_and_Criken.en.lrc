[ve:61.1.100]

[00:20.69]What is up?
[00:23.97]How's it going?
[00:28.54]Good to see you again.
[00:29.56]I just saw you yesterday.
[00:33.64]Well, maybe some of you who knows it could be a completely different group of people.
[00:38.27]It probably is a different group of people usually.
[00:44.79]How the fuck are you?
[00:53.51]Good.
[00:54.21]Bad.
[00:54.81]Good.
[00:55.51]Bad.
[00:56.21]Good.
[00:56.73]Bad.
[00:58.13]That's... So today... I said yesterday I wasn't sure if we were going to start with this or end with this.
[01:14.09]But we are starting with it.
[01:16.44]And the reason for that is we've... Not quite the group here.
[01:22.38]We got four people.
[01:27.13]Who I'm calling the sponsor boys.
[01:30.01]Because all four of us have.
[01:32.73]A sponsor for this game.
[01:40.20]Me Ster poke and criken all have the same sponsor.
[01:46.46]So, uh, we're just gonna play it together over the next couple days.
[01:50.01]Don't, that's not, I, I don't have an Elmo laugh.
[01:52.98]I have a cartoon laugh.
[01:57.34]It actually is pretty Elmo-like.
[02:02.19]So, we're gonna start with this.
[02:03.48]We'll be playing this for about two hours.
[02:06.78]After this...
[02:09.40]When this couple of hours concludes, we will move on to either Dracula 3.
[02:18.49]That's ready to go.
[02:20.85]Or... Or... Watch Ster play White Knuckle and get popcorn and just relax.
[02:32.41]It could be either one of those.
[02:34.69]It could be both of those things.
[02:35.87]I mean, we'll see.
[02:46.10]Why do you always sound like a pre-recording?
[02:48.28]I'm just talking into a microphone.
[02:49.56]Will you relax?
[03:00.31]I'm gonna go read a book.
[03:01.86]Dude, you should read a book.
[03:04.24]How many books have you read this year, guys?
[03:10.79]I can tell you how many books I've read this year.
[03:13.15]Zero.
[03:16.73]That's going to change though.
[03:24.66]The cereal box doesn't count.
[03:28.02]I think if you read.
[03:29.14]How many cereal boxes would it take to equal one book?
[03:36.44]Because that's possible.
[03:43.53]Probably 300 a thousand.
[03:53.01]Alright, let's see if everyone's ready to do this.
[03:56.60]Let's check on the check on the sponsor boys.
[04:02.98]You guys good to go?
[04:08.16]You have the reading level of a first grader.
[04:09.86]I abso-fucking-lutely know I don't.
[04:12.43]I have read so much shit on this stream.
[04:15.09]If you really think that, I think that you're a fucking idiot, okay?
[04:20.80]I have the reading level of at least a 10th or 11th grader.
[04:24.40]Way more than that.
[04:27.27]At least like a 12th grader.
[04:33.24]You couldn't read an analog clock.
[04:35.30]This is a sponsor stream right now.
[04:36.56]We're not going to talk about why I couldn't read that clock.
[04:39.95]There was a reason why.
[04:41.65]I'm not going to take that right now.
[04:43.25]You all know what happened.
[04:44.53]We don't need to rewrite history.
[04:49.72]What's going on?
[04:50.88]Sponsor boys.
[04:53.63]What?
[04:55.23]You're cutting out, J-Man.
[04:56.83]Hello?
[04:58.62]Hello?
[05:00.98]What's up, gamers?
[05:02.57]Nothing, just being an alpha dog out here in the hard streets.
[05:06.51]I said, what's up?
[05:07.69]He started the call, so he is the alpha dog.
[05:09.92]I did.
[05:10.80]I sure did.
[05:12.32]First one in the den.
[05:14.74]I call Discord the den now.
[05:16.73]Yeah, welcome to the den.
[05:20.63]What's happening, you guys?
[05:21.59]Isn't it cool that we all have the same thing?
[05:24.96]We all have the same sponsor.
[05:26.40]That's pretty sick.
[05:27.95]That's pretty great.
[05:29.13]It's an excuse to hang out with my friends and make a little money.
[05:32.45]Yes, please.
[05:33.47]Let's go.
[05:34.43]Let's freaking go.
[05:36.24]One absolute serendipity.

[05:42.02]Oh, okay.
[05:42.92]Oh, okay.
[05:43.76]Yeah, we got to get going.
[05:49.09]Imagine being on a laptop doing a sponsor stream.
[05:52.60]You're sweating as you're like going live.
[05:54.50]You're like, I have to hit the two hour mark.
[05:57.45]It's like giving you all the warning signs as it's starting to shut down.
[06:00.61]You get like the critical battery warning.
[06:03.29]Oh, no.
[06:04.81]I'm on my mobile hotspot.

[12:55.00]Really?
[12:55.60]If I laugh, it hurts like hell.
[12:57.80]Okay, so don't be funny at all.
[12:59.80]Yeah, keep it down.
[13:00.62]I'm not going to do any jokes.
[13:02.63]It's going to be pretty standard.
[13:04.79]I'm so sorry to hear that, but this seems like a weird...
[13:07.98]That's going to be hard.
[13:09.02]I feel bad.
[13:10.06]No, no, no.
[13:10.70]Don't worry.
[13:11.12]I knew what I was signing up for.
[13:12.74]This is a funny group.
[13:15.24]You're streaming from the hospital?
[13:19.75]Stop.
[13:20.29]That's not funny.
[13:21.03]The way Criken is from Europe, I would believe it.
[13:24.97]They double booked your hospital room.
[13:27.61]I only have two hours of life on this battery in the hospital bed, please.
[13:31.38]We have to hurry.
[13:32.80]And one hour on the IV, which we'll empty first.
[13:37.19]They won't refill it until the stream is done.
[13:40.47]Yet the sponsor is refilling my IV manually.
[13:43.05]Are you actually in a neck brace on cam?
[13:45.22]Yes.
[13:46.46]Yes.
[13:47.20]How did you pinch your nerve?
[13:49.08]I don't know.
[13:49.54]I woke up like that.
[13:51.28]Oh, old.
[13:51.90]Old.
[13:52.68]I thought you pinched it yourself.
[13:56.87]I was like, pinch me.
[13:57.97]Go on, pinch me.
[13:59.09]And they just fucking snapped my neck.
[14:02.53]Alright, well, we'll try to keep that in mind for you.
[14:06.10]Thank you so much, guys.
[14:07.94]Okay.
[14:08.62]Or if you're going to be funny, just give me a heads up and I'll look away.
[14:16.47]Alright.
[14:17.19]Like if you feel a joke coming on, that's all I ask.
[14:19.95]This might be funny, but... I'm going to stick to the facts.
[14:26.74]Stick to the facts.
[14:31.05]Alright, so this is... we're very low level, right?
[14:33.39]So we're... Yeah, this is mission number one after the tutorial.
[14:38.86]They're gonna go easy on us.
[14:39.62]These are goblins, right?
[14:42.03]Do you guys have, like, 7 TV?
[14:43.41]Uh, yeah.
[14:47.33]Oh.
[14:48.73]Just wondering if you guys were hip like that.
[14:52.58]Alright, it's teaching us the dodge roll.
[14:55.18]Do you guys have low?
[14:55.86]What is that?
[14:57.92]The low emote?
[15:00.03]I, dude, I have, I don't have anything.
[15:05.70]I still have a VCR.
[15:07.30]Can you describe it for those of us that don't have it?
[15:10.85]I'm thinking of getting Blu-ray.
[15:13.22]Wait, we need to do a block break.
[15:16.12]Some things can be... I'm worried about your neck right now, so I'm not going to say anything.
[15:19.95]Yeah.
[15:21.49]Not knowing is worse.
[15:22.29]A really good one, but I'm keeping it in the chamber.
[15:25.01]I'm sorry.
[15:25.41]Dude, I'm just waiting for someone to do something funny and say something funny, and all of a sudden, Craig is just like, ow.
[15:33.92]I sneezed the first day I got this, and then I screamed.
[15:39.07]I screamed so loud.
[15:40.99]I sound like I died.
[15:42.63]I'm a bad person if I'm trying to make you laugh.
[15:45.07]Yeah, but it's okay.
[15:46.11]I would be doing the same in your situation, so I don't hold against you.
[15:48.55]Well, actually, sorry to hear that.
[15:49.77]Hopefully it's not... Hopefully it gets better.
[15:52.28]I'm on so many drugs right now, so it's starting to get better.
[15:57.49]They prescribed me steroids and muscle relaxant, which is like an upper and a downer.
[16:02.17]Oh my god.
[16:03.22]I don't know what's going on in my brain right now.
[16:04.86]It's very strange.
[16:06.40]All because you went to bed.
[16:08.23]Yeah.
[16:09.14]Let that be a lesson.
[16:10.36]Do not go to bed.
[16:11.70]Yes, please, everyone.
[16:13.38]Do not sleep.
[16:14.40]This could be you.
[16:14.84]Can we get a Freddy vs. Jason scenario?
[16:18.23]If you go to bed, I'll pinch your neck.
[16:22.42]You gotta wake up with a pinched nerve in your neck.
[16:26.48]How do I heal?
[16:28.40]Up on the D-pad.
[16:29.71]Nice.
[16:30.87]I'm using controller this time, not mouse and keyboard.
[16:33.23]Noob.
[16:35.35]Sorry.
[16:36.44]It's a big one.
[16:38.58]Boss.
[16:38.90]Oh, that is big.
[16:43.54]Alright, everybody on the count of three, everyone say, boss.
[16:47.57]Ready?
[16:48.57]One, two, three.
[16:50.57]Boss.
[16:51.19]Boss.
[16:51.72]Boss.
[16:52.12]Boss.
[16:52.62]No.
[16:54.38]There's desync, I think.
[16:56.08]Yeah, we're a little delayed.
[16:59.15]I actually was late.
[17:00.73]One try again, I'm done.
[17:03.03]If we see a boss on screen, we have to wait one second, then all have to go.
[17:07.11]Boss.
[17:08.61]Is this door the explorer?
[17:10.48]Boss, can you say boss?
[17:16.30]F-O-S-S.
[17:19.58]Boss.
[17:20.41]Purple.
[17:20.79]And no, that is not in the contract.
[17:23.21]I'm just giving it a little twist.
[17:27.65]You need to tell everyone to say boss.
[17:33.89]Look at Prince Chris's face up top.
[17:40.14]Stop.
[17:40.90]Stop.
[17:41.70]Stop picking.
[17:43.40]Don't point it out.
[17:46.23]Why is your face so small?
[17:48.75]I don't know.
[17:50.29]You're kind of weird looking.
[17:51.75]You do that on purpose?
[17:54.18]What's wrong with that guy?
[17:56.50]Let me take the helmet off and you'll see what we're fucking really working with here.
[17:59.42]Hold on.
[18:00.86]I can't do it right now.
[18:02.02]Imagine being born with a face like a third the size of everyone else.
[18:05.22]Just like same proportions, but it's just really fucking small on the entire head.
[18:10.49]Look at him.
[18:11.51]Is it going to be... Are we going to show like a kill count there?
[18:14.85]Because I feel like it did a lot of work.
[18:18.37]Uh-oh.
[18:18.93]Let me see it.
[18:19.33]We all ranked up.
[18:21.96]Ooh.
[18:22.78]Two levels.
[18:24.26]Okay.
[18:27.12]New skill.
[18:29.80]Oh, it says I killed the most.
[18:31.64]what wait no yeah and it took the most damage damn dude you get what do you say that he's right art rt dude I look at that damage dealt though I was all over the place damn actually wait how do you change your weapons I want to go to the rock guy I think we just return to the belfry yeah and then you start and put on it you're level four
[19:04.09]Wait, I'm still zero.
[19:09.06]Wait, should we do one more?
[19:10.92]Should we do one more mission?
[19:12.72]We're going to do multiple more.
[19:15.99]Can we do one more?
[19:17.07]Can we do another one?
[19:19.19]Just one more.
[19:22.33]Yeah, so we got skills now.
[19:26.01]This is where you kind of alright I do what I want to play as the Sentinel looks like it's sword and shield.
[19:31.84]And a little bit of everything block parries pyroclast.
[19:37.16]War Club you can burn.
[19:41.53]Big rock hands.
[19:43.07]The part class was fun.

[21:11.14]I kind of want no helm, so they have to see what my head looks like.
[21:17.73]I think these are all the same.
[21:27.22]I'm going to go green.
[21:28.10]I'm going to go green.
[21:28.68]I like the green.

[21:48.81]Are you wearing a wig?
[21:56.29]I wonder if this carries over.
[22:00.44]Where's the completion for this?
[22:03.02]I gotta level up, guys.
[22:07.00]Complete.
[22:07.62]Well, yeah, can we just do one more?

[22:13.63]Where do you complete this?
[22:14.41]Is it on the world map?
[22:16.87]The quest?
[22:17.29]That should be like a big old.
[22:19.49]Big old icon.
[22:26.14]Yeah.

[23:32.48]Yeah, we have to go to the map and do that.
[23:34.12]Oh, we haven't done that.
[23:34.94]Okay, I thought we just completed it.
[23:37.51]So you are ready.
[23:39.43]Technically, yes.
[23:44.05]I got a new shield.
[23:46.32]I'm a big fan of role play.
[23:47.40]I was wondering if you guys could flesh out your characters a bit with some backstory.
[23:52.52]Mine is an alien from space.
[23:56.15]Very cool.
[23:58.52]And I'm here in the Snaggleshire trying to get lucky.
[24:05.01]Oh.

[24:09.64]Oh, lucky loot.
[24:10.06]I'm trying to get this loot.
[24:11.50]I'm a bird.
[24:13.84]Jerry killed the bird.
[24:14.96]My character is a squire who's not quite ready for knighthood yet.
[24:19.69]I thought you were a prince.
[24:22.39]I thought you were going to narrate like a full book.
[24:26.38]It is Prince in the name.
[24:29.13]Can a prince be a squire?
[24:29.91]So his first name is Prince?
[24:32.63]Hey, Polk, look at the top left for a sec.
[24:33.89]His last name's Chris.
[24:34.93]First name Prince, last name Chris.
[24:36.08]Take a look at the top left for a sec.
[24:39.56]Dude, you took off your hat?

[25:28.89]Me too.
[25:33.48]Boss.
[25:37.22]It's not a boss.
[25:39.73]Sorry, it had an icon.
[25:41.95]I was trying to get the jump on it.
[25:46.16]Make sure you guys, do you equip your new skills when you level?
[25:49.74]No.
[25:52.08]Can't think.
[25:55.10]Nice juggle.
[25:56.94]I forgot the button already, though.
[25:58.84]Knocking him up.
[26:01.09]Like a fighting game.
[26:04.81]Stunning.
[26:05.47]You spend all the time in training mode, then you go into the match, you're like, I can't do one move.
[26:09.76]I can't do the combo.
[26:12.58]Those tents are burping him out.

[26:52.45]Your neck's getting to your brain.
[26:54.94]No, that's the steroids getting to my brain.
[26:58.31]Dude, time to lift.
[27:00.72]The doctor said, this will make you a little more aggressive, so be careful.
[27:06.91]Is it going to make you more aggressive?
[27:09.23]Yeah.
[27:10.03]You need to look at the positive side and find an area in your life that you need to be more aggressive in.
[27:16.70]Like you just took a power-up pill.
[27:19.20]Oh, you're right.
[27:20.00]My collapse.
[27:21.02]I should be a little more aggressive.
[27:22.38]I'm often a little more laid back.
[27:23.59]I don't think that's... It's time to level up.
[27:27.37]Yeah, so like...
[27:30.31]Start yelling at one of us.
[27:31.15]We got to beat this in 30 seconds.
[27:32.43]If you take damage and it's our fault, really let us know today.
[27:35.95]Hey, squad.

[27:38.47]We got to beat these in 30 seconds.
[27:40.70]Alright.

[27:47.22]It hurts to yell.
[27:52.59]Last tent.
[27:53.29]Focus up.
[27:57.78]Need damage on that tent.
[28:00.83]Got it.
[28:03.48]The version of aggressive is cooperative.
[28:08.00]I'm going to help these guys.
[28:14.85]Assertive, assertive.
[28:17.91]Those raid leaders.
[28:19.95]The roids that make you a raid leader.
[28:25.52]I'm so colorblind.
[28:29.22]Okay.
[28:29.92]Just letting you guys know.
[28:33.33]The red health bars are hard to see.
[28:35.29]Sorry to hear that.
[28:35.79]What do they look like?
[28:37.31]I don't know.
[28:41.02]What do you mean?
[28:44.08]I just gotta squint.
[28:44.92]You know what I mean?
[28:45.40]I gotta squint to see them.
[28:47.51]Okay.
[28:48.19]Okay, what does that have to do with color?
[28:51.47]They blend in.
[28:53.61]The grass?
[28:55.86]I guess, yeah.
[28:59.93]Walking.
[29:01.13]I saw the stream where you were talking about that and you realize that you find out that you're colorblind every four months and you forget.
[29:09.02]Oh, that must be not fun.
[29:10.26]I talk about it every day.
[29:14.05]It's one of my main content pieces.
[29:18.99]It's a reoccurring thing.
[29:21.38]Watch out for the spikes.
[29:22.14]Hop over them.
[29:23.66]Nice, dude.
[29:24.30]Good call out.
[29:26.56]You can do it, Glorpette.
[29:28.92]I believe in you.
[29:29.68]I'm not aggressive enough.
[29:34.63]Was that Criken sneezing?
[29:35.93]Are you alright?
[29:37.51]Don't worry, it's not me.
[29:38.77]Oh, okay.
[29:39.11]I actually got scared.
[29:40.09]If it's me, you'll hear it.
[29:47.52]Have you sneezed yet?
[29:48.72]Have you sneezed at all?
[29:49.72]No, don't even start talking about it because he's going to make him sneeze.
[29:53.35]I'm so tired.
[29:54.76]I'm yawning.
[29:57.00]Oh, don't yawn.
[29:57.54]That actually hurts too.
[29:59.11]And I'm an empath.
[30:00.15]It's going to work.
[30:00.67]Wait, I'm not yawning.
[30:01.53]This is so fun.
[30:02.48]What can you do?
[30:03.18]I was yawning.
[30:06.00]That was a joke.
[30:08.41]My agent just messed with me.
[30:17.60]Wait, I'm also being messaged by my agent.
[30:21.37]Okay, hold on.
[30:23.13]You guys are getting messaged by your agent?
[30:25.35]We're doing something wrong.
[30:26.29]Hold on.
[30:26.61]We're doing something wrong?
[30:27.47]I need to check.
[30:28.69]You got to cover for me.
[30:30.56]Yeah, I'm getting messaged.
[30:31.72]You guys are not being funny enough.
[30:33.86]Oh.
[30:34.66]Uh-oh.
[30:37.06]That's Jerma every time I play games with him.
[30:39.56]Discord is lighting up.
[30:41.85]What?
[30:42.31]Me saying, you got to be better than this.
[30:44.62]You gotta be, like, funnier.
[30:45.54]Like, why are you not being funnier?
[30:46.72]It's just constant, the nitpicking.
[30:50.95]It was good, but next time be funnier.
[30:52.41]I fell.
[30:53.05]Yeah.
[30:54.89]Alright, break bar.
[30:55.67]Break bar is a yellow bar located beneath an enemy's health bar.
[30:58.01]Certain skills and moves do break bar damage in others.
[31:00.32]Break the break bar and inflict it on the break bar.
[31:02.96]Huh?
[31:04.12]I will break the break bar with my big break bar hands.
[31:06.36]Somebody has a stun.
[31:07.12]Boss!
[31:07.85]Boss?
[31:09.03]Bar?
[31:10.19]Boss?

[32:27.23]Oh my god.
[32:28.35]I'm already blasting them.
[32:30.85]Careful on your health potions.
[32:32.16]I only have... I have none left.
[32:34.02]I have one.
[32:34.86]You have none left?
[32:37.30]Dude, I've been chugging.
[32:39.32]You've been in the middle of it.
[32:41.26]What have you been doing, Chris Pratt?
[32:43.26]I got the shield, man.
[32:44.44]I'm the shield guy.
[32:47.22]It's not a full block.
[32:47.95]It's 50% damage.
[32:49.11]Okay, well, you must not be blocking with your shield if you're taking that much damage.
[32:52.93]It's 50% damage reduction on a block.
[33:00.78]Clear comms.
[33:05.24]Okay, after you clear comms, you have to make a call, though.
[33:11.50]Good.
[33:12.78]Finish it.
[33:13.92]Kill him.
[33:15.14]Kill him.

[39:17.54]Yeah, I know.
[39:18.64]I don't think you should withhold though.
[39:23.15]Really?
[39:23.77]Your neck's fine.
[39:25.44]Where is Bumble?
[39:30.12]Look at your map and you'll see an icon.
[39:33.96]Where's Matt?
[39:35.44]Oh, wait, never mind.
[39:37.78]He's in the middle.
[39:38.36]He's a big forge.
[39:42.27]Okay.
[39:47.33]Dude, I'm just upgrading.
[39:54.14]Nice.
[39:54.36]Okay, I get it.
[40:05.14]Uh, there's a trial coming up after this.
[40:19.54]What?
[40:21.28]DPS.
[40:22.34]Okay, the in-game NPC is telling you that what's coming up is a DPS check.
[40:28.29]That is his dialog.
[40:33.10]Okay, would you want him to lie?
[40:34.87]That's just funny.
[40:35.42]They're just like, oh, by the way, this is a DPS check.
[40:40.50]Yeah, last time I played, I remember we had to do a single-player boss.
[40:45.37]It was a trial.
[40:45.95]Oh, yeah, we all had to fight it on our own.
[40:48.11]Yeah, it was hard.
[40:49.26]It was hard.
[40:50.06]Oh, it was hard.
[40:52.00]I remember.
[40:54.98]Whoever beats it first try is a good gamer.
[40:58.13]Whoever is the last to beat it needs to read the next advertisement CTA.
[41:07.02]Thank you, Stoic.
[41:12.65]That's not supposed to be a punishment.
[41:16.90]It's not.
[41:18.36]That's supposed to be where... Oh, man.
[41:20.66]Alright.
[41:26.23]Man, I have to say, like, thank you?
[41:30.08]No, I'm just trying to make, like, a fun game for us.
[41:36.22]Oh, I remember this.
[41:37.06]This I was stuck on this for like an hour last time.
[41:41.90]Oh wait.
[41:45.19]We all have to do it for each of if you already did it before on the class.
[41:52.28]Maybe I think.
[41:53.76]Do we leave the danger license trial?
[41:56.22]Was it just up here?
[41:56.85]This is just kind of stuff to do up here.
[41:59.49]Maybe it was back in the town.
[42:09.88]um let's see I think it's like on the far right there's like a door with a dual sign on it oh here it is yeah also if any of you are actually playing this right now or into tomorrow uh I believe it all carries over all your progress during the free to play uh period so you can keep all your stuff
[42:42.18]Is it just right here?
[42:47.56]I don't think last time I played there was damage numbers.
[42:50.59]Oh wait, it's not hard.
[42:51.25]This is actually easy.
[42:53.49]The first trial is easy.
[42:54.53]The one with the boss though is hard.
[42:56.55]Ring the bell.
[42:57.49]So we have to do this alone?
[42:59.36]Yeah.
[43:00.06]Oh, alright.
[43:05.08]Okay.
[43:08.01]Oh, you can check your gear score on the top left.
[43:10.41]We should be able to do this one.
[43:22.58]Wait, was this made by the Banner Saga, guys?
[43:25.86]I believe, yeah, with Microsoft Studios, right?
[43:30.37]Or Xbox Studios?
[43:35.39]Ring the bell.
[43:37.19]Yeah, ring the bell to start.
[43:46.60]I'm going to do the boss one.
[43:47.74]I may have...
[43:49.36]Oh, we timed on it too.
[43:50.58]Alright.
[43:53.17]I finished.
[43:54.17]You finished already?
[44:01.78]Uh, where's Bumble?
[44:02.61]I need to upgrade a weapon.
[44:07.70]I'm getting the parries down.
[44:19.97]I want to get a different umbrella, whatever they're called.
[44:24.90]I like this one, but I want something else.
[44:27.22]Oh, I got it.
[44:37.44]Okay, so we're making the game harder by doing this.
[44:42.66]That's a lot of dust.
[44:44.23]I think we're increasing our danger level.
[44:48.34]That's how we get the better loot, though.
[44:49.96]That's true.
[44:52.32]Oh, yeah, I remember this one.
[44:53.32]We actually have to do a... I'm not going to spoil it.
[44:55.31]You'll see.
[44:56.77]I'm going to go pee-pee, though.
[44:57.83]One second.
[44:58.41]Thank you, Stoic.
[45:03.40]They provided him with the water that he drank.
[45:11.33]Alright, return to courage.
[45:14.81]I passed.
[45:18.00]So now I think the game is opened up completely.
[45:23.91]We can go pretty much wherever we want around that.
[45:26.21]There's like at least a few different hexagons to look at.
[45:32.84]These enemies fight back.
[45:35.02]Yeah, dude, it's a trial.
[45:37.93]I beat the next trial too.
[45:43.25]You weren't supposed to do that.
[45:44.95]Oh, no.
[45:45.35]It's going to be too hard for us now.
[45:46.97]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[45:48.87]You're level like six.
[45:56.30]I have a quest here I can do.
[46:01.93]You can just make your class whoever you want, right?
[46:04.07]That's cool.
[46:06.21]You can swap out skills, I think.
[46:11.00]Thanks, Stoic.
[46:13.59]Those classes, by the way, are Sentinel, Pyroclast, Rockbreaker, or Shadow Striker.
[46:28.39]Oh, I gotta speak to Ogden.
[46:36.66]I got a better hat, didn't I?
[46:42.01]That barely covers the top part of my head.
[46:49.13]And it's not a hat.
[46:52.62]It does look.
[46:54.40]It looks a little odd.
[47:02.79]I'll stick with Sentinel.
[47:08.97]Yeah, I'm looking shadow striker.
[47:19.57]Okay.
[47:23.32]No weapons.
[47:23.98]I got some new stuff though.
[47:27.74]I'm gonna go break a bunch of stuff down.
[47:28.97]I'm gonna be... Dude, I'm gonna be so decked out.
[47:31.19]I'm gonna be the strongest one of the party.
[47:34.91]I got a drink.
[47:42.13]From Stoic?
[47:44.67]Yes.
[47:45.74]And we said, why am I playing as the default Andy?
[47:48.85]I like the sword.
[47:50.99]Sword and shield.
[47:52.07]People hating on sword and shield.
[47:53.75]You read that one comment out of 20,000.
[47:56.06]Your first comment read.
[47:57.22]Why are you?
[47:57.78]Yeah, I think you can put.
[48:03.32]Can you put this in?
[48:05.27]Hold on.
[48:06.93]Why did you read that?
[48:08.33]I don't know.
[48:08.79]I don't know.
[48:11.23]Love wins, Jerma.
[48:17.71]Love you.
[48:20.01]I am a huge fan of you too.
[48:26.04]Oh, that was so sweet.
[48:33.57]Uh, these aspects should we break him down, but I feel like this is 10% hurt is kind of awesome.
[48:39.44]Oh, there's a train like slot them in on your.
[48:43.49]What is up to?
[48:54.05]Do you guys use mouse and keyboard for this?
[48:56.60]No.
[48:57.92]Nah.
[49:00.56]I'll control it all the way.
[49:08.59]Are you ready for another mission?
[49:11.24]I almost am ready.
[49:13.98]I am accepting crafts requests from the board, then I assume we're ready.
[49:20.09]Defeat 20 gobos.
[49:26.22]I think you get like daily quests and you get them, you finish them, you get writs and those writs unlock the different things on that.
[49:34.43]Curious like tree and like a like a Helldivers Battle Pass style thing where you like work your way down the path to get more stuff.
[49:45.82]OK, I'm ready.
[49:47.72]I can go to world map, but I'm I'm the leader.
[49:50.30]I gotta speak to Ogden and then I think I'll be ready to go.
[49:55.55]What are you going to say to him?
[49:56.69]I don't know.
[49:57.13]We'll see.
[49:58.17]I'll let you know in a sec.
[50:05.44]Splies.
[50:08.71]Oh, the request board.
[50:09.81]I think this is like a quest board.
[50:12.43]I can't block.
[50:14.92]Yeah, I don't think we get blocks as the dagger guys.
[50:16.86]We just dodge.
[50:17.68]Yeah, it's just shield man who is apparently basic.
[50:20.54]That one guy who said he's basic.
[50:22.97]Well, he didn't know you're the only one who can block.
[50:25.21]and I am really happy for it wait if you're gonna go dagger guy I might go fire staff guy then because this next quest makes us all change classes does it oh really you see it this is uh you gotta do one of each I think that is a side quest but yes we do it we will have to do that I'm not I have a level though if you 20 gobos is the one that I have for yeah perhaps request yeah I think there's a lot of optional ones so wouldn't yeah we can do it
[50:58.90]I'm ready for a quest.
[51:06.27]Okay.
[51:07.73]Crafts request.
[51:10.10]Kill the gobos.
[51:11.98]I guess we do the same mission and kill the gobos?
[51:14.77]Let's do it.
[51:15.47]Oh, I just have rewards.
[51:17.49]Uh-oh.
[51:21.04]fastest way to get oh you have to go to the map uh and we and I'm setting it to danger two which says that gear score 130. oh I don't yeah I don't know that I did that I think that's gonna I think you guys can handle it f-u-c-k I almost just said that right there that's gonna destroy us our gear score I'm 56. uh it should be the gear icon uh-oh
[51:51.28]Uh oh.
[51:54.10]We're gonna have to focus up here.
[51:55.26]Oh, I got the quest now.
[51:57.74]I got 158.
[51:58.36]Alright, well you better carry.
[52:02.05]Ready up.
[52:03.49]Uh, our gear score, we are 100% too weak for this, by the way.
[52:07.29]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[52:09.84]It's gonna lock in, it's alright.
[52:11.94]That, that gear score is recommended for people who aren't certified gamers.
[52:15.83]Exactly.
[52:16.01]I just got mine in the mail, I put it in the plaque.
[52:18.11]I got one yesterday for beating Act 2 of White Knuckles, so I'm glad to get that.
[52:23.81]Very impressive.
[52:24.77]Criken hasn't done that, and he needs to do that now.
[52:28.64]This is like the water bucket challenge.
[52:32.06]I name you Criken.
[52:35.39]Sure, I played more.
[52:37.89]Oh, did you play White Knuckles?
[52:39.45]Like 20 minutes.
[52:40.77]No, I played more the other day.
[52:42.14]You didn't see it?
[52:43.30]I didn't know.
[52:43.86]I got kind of far.
[52:45.84]I have to tune in.
[52:48.46]Is it the new falling game where everyone climbs a bunch and then falls and then gets mad?
[52:54.77]Yeah.
[52:55.21]No.
[52:55.97]Yes, it is.
[52:56.57]No.
[52:57.11]No.
[52:57.57]No.
[52:58.30]Yeah.
[53:00.56]Well, okay.
[53:01.38]You can control your character unlike other ones.
[53:04.56]I would tell you it's probably one of the... It's probably up there as it's the best one of those that's ever come out, I think.
[53:12.43]Oh, really?
[53:13.29]Without a doubt.
[53:18.10]you guys uh tried baby steps yet it was a demo during next fest you know I have not I've tried um power born yeah I've only tried yeah wait there's other games which I'm having fun with my I'm having fun with my sponsor boys oh I'm okay uh we actually am I dead yeah yeah dude this is the 150 guys you gotta pay attention here
[53:56.56]I got to say, for a 150, I'm feeling confident.
[54:00.20]Well, this is great.
[54:00.78]This will probably level us up like crazy.
[54:03.39]We're about to be level 40.
[54:04.13]Watch out, thorns!
[54:08.07]They're still there.
[54:08.73]Do you guys ever get like, when you're a kid and you go out adventuring and you either find poison ivy or a bramble bush and just fucking dive right into it?
[54:22.83]No.
[54:23.92]No?
[54:24.06]Wait, you jump into poison ivy for fun?
[54:26.47]I didn't know what it was at the time, but I found out later.
[54:33.98]Hey, just me thing.
[54:35.05]Sorry.
[54:35.35]That's alright.
[54:35.93]Yeah, just you.
[54:36.35]Sorry.
[54:36.59]We cannot relate to you.
[54:37.31]Try to find a more relatable story next time.
[54:38.97]Yeah.
[54:41.64]No, I mean, I've, uh, I've, like, out in the woods, like, swam in a random, like, pond that was, like, disgusting.
[54:49.63]And that was stupid.
[54:52.01]as kids did you guys think that scoliosis was the most devastating disease that our world has ever seen you had to be checked for it yearly oh yeah I do remember that you ever graffiti no no I have not I had a spray paint phase but like on canvases
[55:14.25]I spray painted in a... like a tunnel once.
[55:18.15]That's all.
[55:18.77]Bad boy.
[55:19.76]Yeah, it was cool.
[55:21.04]I have no idea.
[55:22.08]Hoke was here or what?
[55:24.18]No, it was just my old name.
[55:25.47]It was very cringe.
[55:27.39]It was like Z-O-N.
[55:28.97]That water that I dove into was dark green, by the way.
[55:31.70]I forgot to mention that.
[55:33.64]Demon Lord Zon was here.
[55:36.40]What was your first gamer name?
[55:38.77]Mine was iGod, like the iPod.
[55:41.91]That's pretty modern for that to be your first It was one of my first like I remember having that Yeah, you're right.
[55:52.68]It was it does sound modern, but it was there.
[55:55.34]I got pretty good man That's a great one.
[55:58.10]Actually, you should have gone with that instead of hokey main Yeah That was my Counter-Strike name.
[56:04.07]I got
[56:05.72]Are you good at Counter-Strike?
[56:06.84]Because if not, I feel like that would be really annoying.
[56:08.84]I was pretty good, man.
[56:09.86]I did scouts and eyes only.
[56:12.64]I used to go into old AOL group chats.
[56:17.67]Old AOL, the original AOL.
[56:20.85]And I think my name was like the Arcade Boy or something.
[56:24.94]With an R. It was just capital R. It was capital R. And I would sit there and I would ask people.
[56:31.58]I would have a cheat code guidebook sitting right next to me.
[56:36.14]And I would be like, who has a question for the arcade master?
[56:39.79]And I would actually, people would ask me about like, oh, what about love like Zelda?
[56:44.28]And I would flip through and I'd be like, I got you.
[56:46.46]And I would, I would give them like tips and cheats.
[56:49.77]Wow.
[56:50.73]You're an authority in this space.
[56:51.74]To back you up.
[56:52.90]that was like pre-internet I'm assuming like aol this is like original aol this is very when I would go to school and we had like a typing class that was the only access to the internet I would have and I would literally check like the starcraft cheat codes while I was there and write them down Lawrence Lawrence dude I remember computer class and like uh doing computers as a kid and I thought bowser the browser was bowser I'm talking about browsers like dude Mario
[57:20.79]What the fuck is Bowser?
[57:21.63]Wait, it's like a browser?
[57:23.46]Yeah, I thought Bowser was going to come on my computer the whole time.
[57:25.86]I'm like waiting for... That's scary.
[57:28.44]That's so funny.
[57:29.30]Where is he?
[57:29.70]Where is he?
[57:30.16]There was a jump scare.
[57:32.58]My first name was Monkey Chunky Hunky.
[57:36.19]Wow.
[57:37.19]Good name.
[57:38.59]It was from Fairly Oddparents.
[57:41.11]Oh.
[57:42.83]Oh.
[57:43.10]You don't think it's good anymore?
[57:44.72]Well, yeah, I thought it was original like everyone else's.
[57:46.32]Yeah, no, sorry.
[57:49.51]I apologize.
[57:52.88]Mine was literally just cracking.
[57:53.92]To this day, I'm Chunky.
[57:58.29]Well, I mean, at least you leveled up, right, from Chunky Monkey to Star.
[58:02.58]Or, you know, that's a pretty...
[58:05.33]nah I like the timeline where I'm still chunky monkey yeah I remember I was part of it it was I think it was like an old like it was an old chat room where everyone pretended to we would just role play as wrestlers like wwf wrestlers yeah and it was like oh I will I suplex you into the mat and the crowd goes crazy and we were all different wrestlers
[58:28.60]Were you still Arcade Kid at this time, or did you... Oh, no, no, no, no.
[58:31.70]No, I was a wrestler.
[58:33.35]Wrestling kid, yeah.
[58:36.09]I was a referee.
[58:37.88]It was legit RP, though.
[58:39.64]We were RPing as some of those superstars.
[58:42.97]I genuinely love the old text RP days on the internet.
[58:47.09]Those are so wholesome and cringe.
[58:49.74]Mm-hmm.
[58:53.03]Not a lot.
[58:55.06]I still do this today.
[58:58.48]It's my job now.
[59:01.20]Can't say it on stream.
[59:04.03]Can't say it in the sponsored stream.
[59:05.57]Sorry.
[59:07.63]Have we killed 20?
[59:08.35]Yeah.
[59:09.29]I feel like we have.
[59:10.51]Oh, definitely.
[59:11.07]Well, it's not like we're ending the mission.
[59:13.76]Leave the village to their feet.
[59:15.48]Yeah.
[59:15.94]Let's just forget about it.
[59:16.96]Boss.
[59:18.50]Boss.
[59:19.59]Boss.
[59:20.31]Boss.
[59:20.84]Dude, I just got a message from my agent that, hey, you had the mouse on the screen for the last 40 minutes.
[59:27.75]Completely inexcusable.
[59:30.40]I just moved it.
[59:31.34]I'm kind of freaking out.
[59:34.62]Yeah, we got to do two more hours, guys.
[59:36.30]I had my mouse on screen.
[59:41.69]I didn't get a parry.
[59:42.43]That sounds like it was a bad thing.
[59:44.09]I'm enjoying the game.
[59:45.56]Why are they punishing you guys?
[59:49.11]No, I am genuinely enjoying this.
[59:51.05]This is fun just to kind of beat stuff up and hang out.
[60:01.62]This guy is getting murder-tailed, though.
[60:05.48]Yeah, we're definitely rising the cage.
[60:06.91]You know, despite the higher DPR score, we're still killing it.
[60:10.73]That's not a parry.
[60:12.85]I need to get better at parries.
[60:13.85]I'm the parry one.
[60:18.99]Oh, you just got quadrupled.
[60:26.29]Oh, that looks like a parry.
[60:29.85]There we go.
[60:32.98]We're gonna level up like crazy from this.
[60:37.89]Oh, you're parrying him?
[60:38.71]That's why he's just like stun-locked forever?
[60:41.81]That seems awfully basic.
[60:49.35]Finish it up.
[61:01.23]No, my combo.
[61:08.07]I almost died right there.
[61:08.76]I was doing work on this one.
[61:10.78]That's not even a joke.
[61:14.52]Finished it.
[61:17.79]I thought it was a joke.
[61:19.57]Ooh, there's a purple somewhere.
[61:20.58]I got a purple.
[61:23.34]Purple?
[61:23.50]I'm purple, I'm purple.
[61:24.64]Somebody said, yeah, drops are on.
[61:26.20]How long do you have to watch for drops?
[61:29.15]Usually it's like an hour or two.

[62:14.58]Okay.
[62:14.70]Criken, how the hell did you do 40,000 damage and I did 14,000?
[62:18.40]This guy is over-leveled.
[62:19.88]I had a higher gear score.
[62:22.21]It was not skill.
[62:23.11]I just... Yeah, he was like gear score 100-something.
[62:26.83]Yeah.
[62:26.97]Damn.
[62:28.66]Oh, my God.
[62:29.42]You really did do an insane amount of damage.
[62:33.40]I did pretty good, like, on the pleb scale.
[62:37.91]Yeah.
[62:38.51]Oh, you guys did great.
[62:40.15]I'm done with that.
[62:40.71]Thanks.

[62:44.02]Poke.
[62:44.84]I'm sending you a DM.
[62:46.70]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[62:50.05]That's not good enough.
[62:55.72]I've added like 40 people by accident.
[63:02.73]Return to the quest board because we finished the quest.
[63:06.28]Yeah, I'm also literally on steroids, which is probably helping, so.
[63:09.42]That's true.
[63:10.40]Then we get Ritz for this, which is one of the currencies.
[63:17.91]The cracker?
[63:20.39]W-R-I.
[63:21.37]Cheese Ritz are so good.
[63:23.65]Damn, they are, with the cheese in the middle.
[63:32.54]Where's Kraft?
[63:35.03]Grabs mac and cheese with the Ritz crackers?
[63:41.44]Wait, did I just invite this guy to be friends?
[63:44.45]See?
[63:54.13]I want a new sword.

[64:26.79]Okay, as a four-person party in the world, what class would you think we would all be?
[64:36.24]Out of the four classes in this game?
[64:38.42]Yeah.
[64:41.12]This guy loves the character quiz.
[64:45.29]Like, what character are you?
[64:46.27]MySpace quiz.
[64:49.13]I always love those because you do like the SpongeBob one, for instance.
[64:52.81]What SpongeBob character are you?
[64:54.81]And one of the questions is, do you enjoy large pineapples with front doors?
[65:00.66]It's like, yes, I do.
[65:01.78]It's like, oh, I wonder who you're going to get.
[65:04.73]Is the clarinet your favorite instrument?
[65:07.05]Like, oh, okay.
[65:08.71]Yeah, I'm going to get Squidward.
[65:15.12]I would be a shadow striker.
[65:17.58]I'm so blind.
[65:21.92]I don't know what I'd be.
[65:25.40]I think I'd be... Sentinel.
[65:32.35]Uh, Jerry, uh, Jerry, I almost just reported you.
[65:36.67]How do I go back?
[65:37.53]Okay, don't do that.
[65:38.55]Who's Jerry?
[65:39.13]Me?
[65:39.91]Yeah, you're Jerry.
[65:40.91]Wait, is my name... You named yourself!
[65:43.28]Oh, that was a long time ago!
[65:46.38]It was a long time ago.
[65:47.12]It was an hour and a half ago.
[65:48.84]No, it was yesterday.
[65:51.08]I love that.
[66:03.85]Okay, quest done.
[66:13.96]The name Jerry is so funny.
[66:15.22]I'm sorry.
[66:16.04]I'm sorry.
[66:18.10]My name is not Jerry.
[66:20.17]Wait, is it?
[66:21.07]No.
[66:23.43]Ster, what the fuck?
[66:26.02]Jeremy.
[66:26.78]My name is Jeremy.
[66:27.82]We talked about this.
[66:29.16]Jerry is short for Jeremy, right?
[66:32.24]Wait, so no one's really named Jerry?
[66:34.16]Jerry is short for Gerald.
[66:36.33]What are you talking about?
[66:37.65]Can't it just be both?
[66:39.29]No way.
[66:40.35]Is Gerald the short?
[66:41.67]That's not even shorter than Jeremy.
[66:42.89]It's the same length.
[66:44.20]Yeah, it's Gerald.
[66:45.38]Gerald is Jerry.
[66:48.50]Oh.
[66:49.78]I don't know anyone named Gerald that's a new one always think Jerry has like a like an online funny name or Tom or something there's like there's a one Gerald listening that's funny just pouting what do you mean yeah if your name hey by the way if anybody here is named Jerry or Gerald you've got a funny name I'm sorry this girl yeah my name is georgie you know I got bullied okay oh which I like that name that is Jerry right with a g Gary
[67:21.97]Gary.
[67:25.45]Wait, am I done?
[67:26.81]Oh, no, I got two quests.
[67:29.98]Oh, I think we actually have a couple of these, uh... Yeah, upgrade your gear.
[67:34.34]...curios things.
[67:41.24]Yeah, make sure you upgrade your gear.
[67:45.64]Wait, Jerry is short for a lot of things.
[67:51.13]What else is a short form?
[67:51.81]Are you getting educated?
[67:53.17]But, like, what if your root name is Jerry?
[67:55.21]Is that possible?
[67:56.67]Your root name?
[67:58.86]Yeah, the main name is... Does anyone have Jerry on their passport?
[68:04.39]Send me a picture.
[68:05.39]I'm sure someone does.
[68:06.59]Actually, you know what?
[68:07.65]I think you're right.
[68:08.57]I think, actually, I think you can have just J-E-R-R-Y as a root name.
[68:13.74]I think you're right.
[68:15.91]I'm not crazy.
[68:17.96]You can name your kids like F14Q or whatever.
[68:21.99]I'm sure there's a Jerry.
[68:24.25]I don't think I know a single Jerry in real life.
[68:26.70]I'm trying to think.
[68:27.50]I don't know.
[68:28.78]I know a lot of different strange names, but I've never known a Jerry.
[68:32.03]That's not even that strange.
[68:34.49]Yeah, which is why it's strange that I don't know anyone.
[68:37.46]But I mean, you could have C colon slash Gerald slash Jerry, but you could also have C colon slash Jerry.
[68:48.15]What?
[68:48.65]I think that makes sense, yeah.
[68:49.86]What are you talking about?
[68:51.48]Like, you could have a root directory of Jerry.
[68:52.86]Like, it doesn't have to be Gerald.
[68:54.42]A root directory of a computer joke?
[68:58.24]Oh, I see.
[68:58.88]Computer root.
[68:59.64]Because you could also be, like, C colon slash Gerald slash, in that same directory, it could also be Jerry.
[69:06.87]They could be, like... Like a subfolder.
[69:08.71]Yeah, there's multiple kind of nicknames.
[69:10.83]Like, for instance, like, you know, like William.
[69:12.93]Like C colon slash William slash Bill.
[69:16.20]The worst conversation I've ever been a part of.
[69:18.10]Billy.
[69:19.30]C colon, right.
[69:20.52]You could have a ton of different directories under that.
[69:22.30]Bill I am also would be a subcategory of William.
[69:25.65]Yeah.
[69:27.75]Don't -2 this.
[69:29.01]This is a sponsored stream.
[69:31.08]I just wasted... Oh crap.
[69:36.98]Oh, I just got the cool hat.
[69:40.17]Dude, I'm into this root name thing now.
[69:50.94]I'm like...
[69:52.74]rewiring my brain to think of everything as if you go back really far it's really just John yeah or Adam yeah a lot of us are part of a major uh poke poke when you said that you were actually completely onto something you really were yeah thank you oh poke you started this you know what they say you reap what you sell shouts out if your name's Jerry I'm sorry oh cool I got the hat on
[70:25.43]Subject dismantle.
[70:30.52]So that's the kind of like you said, like the Battle Pass, right?
[70:33.34]You get the little in just a little things.
[70:36.30]We also have three.
[70:37.90]We have three.
[70:39.69]Bigger ones too, I think right from the inventory.
[70:44.59]I don't know if I do.
[70:47.38]I only have 70 writs and you need those to unlock the Battle Pass stuff.
[70:52.45]Are you using the aspects or just disenchanting them for now?
[71:00.40]I have not disenchanted those.
[71:02.90]I haven't seen how to use them.
[71:06.10]There's slots in the gear.
[71:10.55]Oh, here it is.
[71:11.05]I dismantled a few.
[71:13.89]I think this is it.
[71:20.07]It's probably a different gem guy.
[71:21.93]You do Ogden's stuff and then you talk to Rick's.
[71:27.16]For the Rick's rids?
[71:30.32]Stop and pay attention to what I say to you.
[71:33.83]I repeated what you said.
[71:38.79]Okay, there we go.
[71:42.42]Oh, you can only have three quests.
[71:47.44]Oh, I got cosmetics now.
[71:50.55]I got the quest breaking good.
[71:58.72]I get that.
[72:06.93]OK, I got you should get a curio core for this.
[72:10.17]And then you can unlock some stuff.
[72:16.68]I think maybe not yet.
[72:25.78]Okay, I just have complete a mission as rock.
[72:29.47]I'm ready to do missions.
[72:32.65]I don't know what you're on.
[72:36.47]So you can try doing the boss solo, right?
[72:42.18]You guys want me to solo the boss?
[72:44.86]No, the trials, right?
[72:48.96]Okay, I'm soloing the next mission without you guys, I guess.
[72:51.61]No, it's a single player one with the trial.
[72:55.33]Yeah, the left door.
[72:57.43]If you go to the left, it's pretty hard.
[73:02.14]I don't want to get one of these and just everybody go.
[73:03.76]Where did you get that?
[73:11.51]Do you guys need me to do that so that we can up difficulty?
[73:14.74]How far are we going?
[73:16.96]Oh, I guess so.
[73:18.12]That's 188.
[73:22.97]I am going to upgrade my stuff.
[73:29.49]I probably should leave.
[73:33.09]I'm gonna die.
[73:36.78]Wait, you guys already did a mission without me.
[73:39.68]The single player one.
[73:40.14]Yeah, we're already back.
[73:41.68]Oh.
[73:43.31]Yeah, I died to it.
[73:46.27]And you have three minutes... That shit's hard.
[73:49.25]You gotta level up.
[73:51.30]I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm not strong.
[73:54.38]Yeah, he's... I don't think I'm beating this.
[73:56.28]You sent me to die, Poke.
[73:58.13]What?
[73:59.78]yeah I'm just gonna die you sent me to die the forests unfortunately my character revives hey scouts and check the aces I want a reason they're gonna go okay I'll check it out oh god wait a minute are you guys on the lichen fell uh cops
[74:30.37]Yeah.
[74:33.03]Yeah.
[74:47.75]Guys, can we do one more mission?
[74:50.80]Yeah, let's do it.
[74:53.14]I'm heading north along the road.
[74:56.69]Oh my god, I need to die.
[74:59.40]I can't die.
[75:02.18]I'm gonna upgrade my stuff.
[75:03.00]I'm gonna be ready for a wish.
[75:07.81]Oh man.
[75:09.75]Those are way better than what I have.
[75:13.97]These are blue.
[75:18.74]Hold on a second.
[75:20.66]That's your favorite color.
[75:22.30]That is my favorite color.
[75:23.97]The altar different class.
[75:30.60]Is there trading in this?
[75:31.64]I might have items for your guys' class.
[75:35.86]I'm still self-owned.
[75:38.17]Oh, okay.
[75:49.58]These are kind of better.
[75:57.03]They'll only have this?
[75:59.09]Yeah.
[76:07.72]I'm not equipping this, no.
[76:11.05]I'm ready to do whatever you guys want to do.
[76:13.69]Let's go to the cops.
[76:15.54]What was it called?
[76:16.12]Uh, the Lichenfell cops.
[76:22.25]Lichenfell cops.
[76:27.14]Yeah, there you go.
[76:28.08]Okay.
[76:40.88]So I think on the world map, it's like these tiles that you conquer, almost like Risk style, and that gets you access to different areas.
[76:50.33]Yeah, you kind of move the hexagons.
[77:01.27]This person's all the way out there.
[77:07.48]I don't know which direction the cops... Oh, there it is.
[77:11.31]It's right over here.
[77:11.77]Wait, I got out of the zone.
[77:13.40]I think you're higher level, so you can... I think we have to clear this.
[77:18.75]Oh, yeah.
[77:19.09]Alright, let's clear this then.
[77:20.64]Because I can't see it.
[77:22.33]Wait, what are you guys doing?
[77:24.23]Which one is the Lichenfell Cops?
[77:27.17]It's this direction, but we have to clear tiles to get there.
[77:31.02]There's a Chester.
[77:31.68]We should get the one with the Chester here.
[77:33.54]Yeah, let's do it.
[77:34.81]We have to do this one first in the swamp.
[77:37.59]Is there a vinyl edition of this OST?
[77:40.79]I don't know.
[77:41.20]That's a good question.
[77:42.42]It's very pretty.
[77:44.06]It is very nice.
[77:46.90]If I had a vinyl, because I've never had one, I would use it as a food plate.
[77:53.85]Damn, ow.
[77:55.99]Why did I laugh at that?
[77:57.27]That was a waste of a laugh.
[77:58.99]Any of the food you don't like, you scrape to the middle.
[78:02.54]No.
[78:02.62]Yeah, did you only have like four or five laugh lives left before?
[78:07.02]Yeah, really.
[78:08.38]I'm really going to use them more sparingly.
[78:09.52]That did not deserve it.
[78:12.53]New zone.
[78:13.81]I like that when it's my joke, it's undeserved.
[78:17.27]it's not just your joke it's just that one I don't I just what a coincidence hey oh I gotta equip my heavy um you're too literal you're too you're too oh dude no come on hey save it for the gobos
[78:42.04]Oh yeah, you can push him in the poison.
[78:44.35]Thank you so much.
[78:44.87]So it's a sponsorship.
[78:46.27]Sorry about Ster.
[78:49.79]He's not the same since that one joke that I shouldn't have laughed at.
[78:53.32]I apologize for laughing at it.
[78:56.38]I can see now it was in poor taste.
[78:58.90]You should not use vinyls that way.
[79:03.19]Fuck.
[79:03.37]Oh no.
[79:04.39]I don't even have a vinyl player.
[79:08.48]I'm not even like attached to vinyls as a concept.
[79:10.50]I don't know why I'm laughing at it.
[79:28.64]You guys like my new cosmetics, by the way?
[79:29.92]No one commented on it.
[79:31.34]I was gonna say you look cooler than me.
[79:32.90]You do look pretty cool.
[79:34.77]Yeah, we have like two at Athens and one of them is the cool one.
[79:40.44]It's my last game.
[79:43.80]You void the sponsorship because you can't cope.
[79:48.23]Just not feeling it.
[79:58.59]Dude, you can use the currency to get different... I think it might be pet skins or the Umbra skins.
[80:05.15]I was looking at them.
[80:05.80]I kind of want to get one.
[80:07.40]There's some cute ones.
[80:07.92]I got the poison potion one.
[80:10.84]yeah I don't think we can see them until we I could do a certain thing yeah we have to unlock that I thought it was someone else for like a good 30 seconds you thought you looked cool no such luck I think I can have like a shield now
[80:46.48]I really like this class.
[80:48.02]They got a lot of cool moves.
[80:49.59]I'm glad I picked hands.
[80:52.79]I think I'm going to switch to the other guy.
[80:54.63]You're a better rogue.
[80:55.53]Whatever.
[80:58.76]We do the pyromancer.
[80:59.24]Yeah, I'm going to do that.
[81:03.08]I also have pyromancers.
[81:03.99]I could swap if you want.
[81:04.83]I was thinking about doing the pyromancer.
[81:07.93]We get all the pyromancers we want.
[81:09.39]Pyro class, guys.
[81:10.58]Yeah, pyro class.
[81:15.30]Sorry.

[82:24.86]We need more.
[82:26.88]Oh, boy.
[82:27.90]We're not going to get it.
[82:28.88]This is going to be embarrassing.
[82:30.98]We're going to get it.
[82:32.33]More DPS on the Gobbles, man.
[82:36.91]One more.
[82:40.28]Got him.
[82:41.86]Now, Ster is a little too busy hurting our friend.
[82:45.61]What?

[82:47.47]You made him laugh like three times.
[82:48.68]We didn't get chest?

[83:13.34]Wait, Prince Chris is a higher level than all of us now.
[83:16.36]I think the game just kind of understands what's going on.
[83:22.25]I did twice the damage of everyone else.
[83:27.22]That's alright.
[83:28.36]Not mad.
[83:29.80]You're still like level 40.
[83:31.07]It's whatever.
[83:40.58]Can I really say getting on my nerves?
[83:42.18]Yeah, I guess that is not appropriate right now.
[83:46.18]Wait, me?
[83:47.42]I chuckled.
[83:49.25]That's good.
[83:50.49]Oh, I get it.
[83:52.53]I got to stop doing this announcing.
[83:56.66]I got to stop saying I left.
[84:01.12]You want to keep going or you guys really want to go to a town again?
[84:04.48]I want to just punch.
[84:06.25]I want to keep going.
[84:06.93]Yeah, let's go.
[84:07.59]Let's keep fighting.
[84:08.57]I should switch to the pyro.
[84:10.21]Oh, you can open the chest.

[84:43.84]Okay.
[84:45.63]Well, Jerma's going to be there for like 20 minutes.
[84:47.21]No, no, no, no, no.

[84:49.51]Okay.
[84:50.84]Just count to... Oh, we got a Shrek out here.

[85:55.92]He's riffing.
[85:56.40]Let him riff.
[85:56.84]You're a little too literal on that one post.
[86:00.02]That was the first time I was literal.
[86:01.49]That was the first time I was literal.
[86:02.61]Are you calling me out?
[86:04.49]You're taking me pretty literally again, man.
[86:06.77]Get yourself a couple of sponsor boys and have some fun with it.
[86:12.08]Some sponsor boys?
[86:13.02]What does that mean?
[86:15.04]Sponsor your friends to play with you.
[86:18.13]True.
[86:19.93]I just want to upgrade this once and I'm done.
[86:23.88]Prince Chris is really a prince, isn't he?
[86:25.54]Yo, Stoic, can you sponsor my mom, please?
[86:29.17]She's gonna start streaming soon.
[86:31.63]That'd be sick.
[86:32.51]That would be awesome, actually.
[86:38.08]Oh my god, this thing is legit.
[86:42.39]Oh!
[86:42.75]Prince Chris in town, painting his nails.
[86:44.77]I just... Oh, no, I didn't... No, no, no, you popped that up right when I hit B to exit that map.
[86:51.74]It had been up for 30 seconds.
[86:54.02]No, it wasn't.
[86:54.62]Not on my screen.
[86:55.34]Don't at me.
[86:56.35]Oh, sure.
[86:56.85]Okay.
[86:57.55]This was a gear score of 40, by the way.
[87:00.19]I don't know why this one's lower.
[87:02.61]But, like, beating the tier 3 difficulty was hard.
[87:07.98]Let's just speedrun this.
[87:10.36]Yeah, but I'm a new person, so I don't know what I am.
[87:12.10]Look at my sword.
[87:12.76]I just got it.
[87:14.40]Hey, Jerry.
[87:14.90]Nice.
[87:17.01]Yep.
[87:19.47]I think we should have an emote showcase.
[87:20.85]Oh, by the way.
[87:23.11]I can't read.
[87:25.27]I can't read.
[87:26.92]Down on the day pad.
[87:39.26]These things look tasty.
[87:44.83]In the greenest way.
[87:47.43]Yeah.
[87:49.09]There's a hypothetical I've been playing around in my head for a while.
[87:52.22]Would you guys eat a gnome?
[87:53.72]That one in real life?
[87:54.94]Like a real gnome.
[87:56.04]Eat a gnome.
[87:57.50]Yeah, like a three, maybe like a two-inch tall little gnome.
[88:02.11]Do you know one?
[88:05.05]No, but what if you had a hunch that it would give you magic powers if you ate him?
[88:10.61]Where do I get this punch from?
[88:12.12]I don't know.
[88:14.76]Like you are with what you eat sort of thing?
[88:16.02]I feel that gnomes are like sentient creatures, but you can't talk.
[88:20.29]A gnome is a mammal, right?
[88:21.63]A gnome is like a human.
[88:23.33]You don't know what it's saying, but it seems to be communicating in some way or form.
[88:29.80]I don't think I'd eat it.
[88:30.56]I don't know if they are considered human or not.
[88:32.14]I don't think they're the same species.
[88:34.73]Wait, a gnome is definitely a mammal.
[88:39.10]Yeah, I think they're at least a man.
[88:40.28]Yeah, I'm willing to concede that.
[88:42.96]What else could they be?
[88:43.64]Reptiles?
[88:44.85]I don't know, but no, but the gnomes have like babies, right?
[88:49.77]If we're losing at this Gears 440 map, what's going on?
[88:54.36]I'm not saying, I'm saying just hold on, we gotta play.
[89:00.14]I have an entire book about gnomes that does actually assert that they are real.
[89:06.45]You seem like a gnome expert.
[89:08.77]I am a gnome expert.
[89:10.34]So should we eat them?
[89:14.38]Yeah.
[89:14.50]The answer is yes.
[89:15.92]Why?
[89:16.22]I learned enough about them to know that I think they contain some magical properties.
[89:21.27]Especially when prepared properly.
[89:24.77]I mean, if they taste good, yeah.
[89:26.23]I ain't even a gnome.
[89:27.11]No way.
[89:28.17]I'm down.
[89:28.55]It's the first time I've gone down.
[89:29.78]It's been on these little explosive guys.
[89:34.08]This is rough.
[89:35.34]I'm looking for my contacts.
[89:37.33]Someone help me.
[89:38.69]Actually, we're kind of in a little bit of trouble here.
[89:47.58]I'm out of potions.
[89:48.08]I can't get you.
[89:53.03]Guys, use your dodge button.
[89:56.25]Anybody dodging?
[89:59.66]I've been dodging.
[90:00.58]I got you.
[90:02.24]I'm trying.
[90:02.73]No, I wouldn't eat a gnome.
[90:09.44]That's just a human.
[90:11.26]That's a small human.
[90:12.83]Not a human.
[90:13.57]Definitely not.
[90:15.07]That's how they trick you.
[90:18.26]You're telling me that you could eat?
[90:20.30]You walk up to this gnome and it's like, Oh, hello there, sir.
[90:24.12]A Criken?
[90:25.15]So wonderful to meet your acquaintance.
[90:27.07]Oh, I would love to show you some of my jewels and some of my things I have.
[90:30.07]You're going to eat that guy?
[90:35.04]Probably.
[90:35.52]What's wrong with you?
[90:36.86]I was hungry.
[90:39.42]I think I can get away with it, yeah.
[90:41.28]Is that what cursed your neck?
[90:43.44]Okay, I was going to say, I was in Sweden recently and I bought a bunch of gnomes that I brought home.
[90:47.83]And ever since, I got a... You're a slave trader?
[90:51.68]I got a pinched nerve in my neck and I think... I'm looking at one right now.
[90:55.32]He's sitting at my desk.
[90:55.98]He's staring at me.
[90:56.58]He's giving me the eye.
[90:57.68]I think he did this.
[90:58.85]Is this a Willy Wonka scenario?
[91:00.35]Do they work for you?
[91:04.60]they don't move when I'm looking at them but I'm pretty sure they move at night oh yeah no they do that's true yeah so is it that feels unfair that's like if you eat them you're looking at them they can't move right they can't even get away that I don't like this at all you can hear them scream though they just don't tower born people are just in the office like they're all just watching this in one room
[91:29.01]We can change the subject.
[91:29.81]I'm sorry.
[91:30.28]I don't want you to move over me.
[91:31.92]It's the drugs.
[91:32.28]Legal drugs.
[91:32.90]I'm on prescription drugs.
[91:33.84]I'm on drugs.
[91:34.98]It's the drugs.
[91:37.34]Alright.
[91:37.69]We're stoic.
[91:38.43]First of all, sorry that we have somebody here on drugs.
[91:41.55]I'm sorry about that.
[91:44.13]Are we doing the next one or does Jerma need to upgrade his items again?
[91:47.36]Oh, please.
[91:49.66]I am ready.
[91:50.64]Wait, let me even take a look at where we go.
[91:52.73]Okay, fine.
[91:53.97]Let's go.
[91:55.13]We're going to Lichtenfeld all the way to the west in the west.
[92:01.08]Mouse on screen.
[92:02.96]The devs are gnomes.
[92:06.56]You better watch it.
[92:08.42]Yeah, my account is locked.
[92:18.02]Jerry, last one.
[92:19.16]I'm so weak with my new character.
[92:21.60]No, you're not.
[92:21.94]I don't know.
[92:22.94]I am.
[92:23.92]What are you going to do?
[92:24.50]One level.
[92:24.89]What are you going to do?
[92:25.95]Upgrade your gear in town?
[92:28.27]What are you scared?
[92:29.83]Yes.
[92:32.06]I like upgrading things.
[92:33.24]It's one of my favorite things to do in any video game.
[92:34.94]We'll do it after this one.
[92:35.78]You have to space it out.
[92:37.84]Boss.
[92:38.75]Sorry, no.
[92:41.53]It could be though.
[92:45.51]Just keep moving.
[92:48.56]Uh oh.
[92:51.16]We're here.
[92:51.56]Don't worry, we're here.
[92:55.80]The sponsor boys.
[92:59.75]Here to fight evil.
[93:01.83]And protect the innocent.
[93:04.93]She's on a cracker.
[93:05.63]You should have just in time.
[93:08.47]Ritz cracker.
[93:09.81]Ritz.
[93:10.69]Mac and cheese crap.
[93:14.00]Just running back all the classics from earlier in the stream.
[93:16.04]Somebody said, hey, bro, that's not going to stick.
[93:18.58]All of the dots.
[93:21.66]So, yeah, they only blow up when they're in big mode.
[93:24.41]Yeah.
[93:24.61]So don't hit them in big mode.
[93:26.49]What?
[93:26.63]That one blew up and that wasn't a big mode.
[93:28.97]It's not going to stick.
[93:29.95]I love that.
[93:35.05]I'm locked in right now.
[93:39.96]So locked in right now.
[93:48.19]Music is very nice, yes.
[93:49.55]You have a gun?
[93:50.21]I think so.
[93:53.49]You can light things on fire too.
[93:56.34]Okay, that thing's awesome.
[93:58.00]You want to trade?
[93:59.92]You want to trade glass?
[94:02.14]Maybe I'll try.
[94:04.31]I like this class too though.
[94:13.95]I think if you hit them when they're big, it like explodes them on the bar in one hit.
[94:18.03]So if you have any range.
[94:21.16]I think they hurt each other too when they do that.
[94:28.90]I do appreciate this is the kind of game where it's like, at early level, it's just a fun beat-em-up, but then later there's like definitely some strategy, you can tell, between like juggling and stance breaking and stuff that you have to use.
[94:40.11]Wait a minute.
[94:41.86]Hold on.
[94:42.16]Are we moving into the Z-axis?
[94:44.86]Oh, no.
[94:45.42]Are they really going to Z-axis?
[94:47.48]Yeah, let's do a competition here.
[94:48.66]Whoever steps on the least of these wins.
[94:53.41]I just learned the first one.
[94:55.89]That's okay.
[94:57.70]Ow!
[94:57.80]Oh, you got doubled.
[95:02.70]Well, good job.
[95:04.08]That was crazy.
[95:05.44]I guess we all won.
[95:07.57]Boss.
[95:08.09]Boss.
[95:08.97]Trampoline.
[95:09.41]Oh, I thought it was.
[95:11.87]Oh my god, a furry.
[95:17.56]What?
[95:19.92]Are you saying this guy's a furry?
[95:23.28]You didn't see him.
[95:24.29]I don't know about y'all.
[95:25.47]I really like the furries.
[95:27.27]Yeah, half my chat are furries.
[95:29.57]Same.
[95:30.47]As a TF2 player, same.
[95:34.00]Furries run the internet, to be honest.
[95:35.88]You gotta pay respects.
[95:37.44]I feel like people don't mess with the furries anymore.
[95:46.61]Who gives a shit, right?
[95:48.21]People are just fucking hanging out.
[95:54.24]I'm hurting one at the moment.
[96:02.98]Dude, have you not seen my rat Sona?
[96:07.84]I go to Anthrocon every single year.
[96:11.01]I should go.
[96:11.85]For the tax credits.
[96:14.19]Well, I mean... I'm dead, man.
[96:19.19]I'm dead.
[96:20.44]Oh, come on, Jerry.
[96:25.36]Jerry is killed.
[96:27.32]Thank you.
[96:27.96]We can move him back.
[96:28.84]Let's move him back.
[96:29.76]Yeah, yeah.
[96:31.87]He's on the trampoline.
[96:33.93]I'll go for Jerry.
[96:34.77]Alright, you get Jerry.
[96:35.99]I'm just handling, I guess, these infinite archers.
[96:38.87]Thank you.
[96:39.55]I'm learning to juggle.
[96:44.42]No, parry that.
[96:45.12]Shit.
[96:46.38]Wait, oh, I was on cooldown.
[96:53.23]There you go.
[96:55.95]There you go, JerBear.
[96:59.01]That was a double parry.
[97:01.59]Nice job.
[97:03.24]Nice shot.
[97:10.77]Oof.
[97:10.87]I'm having fun in the back.
[97:14.42]I'm just having my own fun.
[97:17.89]I don't know how to just shoot when I... I just want to shoot.
[97:24.12]I think all you're like... My guy's throwing up.
[97:25.80]Oh, no.
[97:32.59]Ooh, purple.
[97:33.73]I saw purple.
[97:35.45]Is that purple?
[97:36.45]Or is that blue?
[97:43.02]Wait, you're colorblind too?
[97:52.63]That's a blue.
[97:55.03]Nice.
[97:56.33]You guys ever get purple nurpled growing up?
[97:59.55]Um...
[98:01.85]Yeah.
[98:02.93]It sucked.
[98:04.93]I hate that.
[98:05.67]Or the towel.
[98:06.73]Is that what I think that is?
[98:08.01]Yeah, just someone grabs your nipple and twists.
[98:11.86]Why are we bringing up your trauma?
[98:16.06]Is there a story behind this you want to share, Poke?
[98:18.33]No, I was just... You were just interested.
[98:20.79]Yeah, I was just thinking about it.
[98:22.57]Someone said purple.
[98:24.07]My chat says, like it's an epidemic.
[98:28.56]I don't think I ever did.
[98:29.60]I'll be honest.
[98:30.28]I don't think anyone...
[98:32.56]yeah I know that was all we did that was that was everywhere it was just like come on man like leave me the fuck alone what I guess I missed out on this or dodge I died a swirly isn't I think of those in the same or a wet willy which of those are the most common yeah I'd be sitting there like you'd be there like reading a book or something all of a sudden it's just like
[98:59.73]Oh!
[99:00.49]He's like, yeah man, I got you!
[99:02.17]Oh yeah, I totally, I totally got you with that.
[99:05.42]Like, get, leave me alone, get away from me.
[99:10.01]Tell him.
[99:10.25]Did that work?
[99:15.08]Dude, this one, I remember this one guy in my school, he would, like, do this thing where, like, he would do this thing where he, like, tried to
[99:21.72]go for like your balls with his hand, but then do like, but do like a, like a sound, like a kiss sound.
[99:28.42]You know what I'm saying?
[99:30.33]Okay.
[99:30.45]Um, but no, you're not touching your, it's not touching.
[99:32.83]It's like a high school, like a, like, Oh, what's up, bro?
[99:36.47]No one did that.
[99:37.58]No one had that.
[99:38.42]It's assault.
[99:39.44]Yeah.
[99:39.58]He's in jail.
[99:40.14]I never met this guy.
[99:41.36]I don't know.
[99:42.08]I can't say.
[99:43.10]He only, he didn't do it to me.
[99:47.07]You didn't know him.
[99:48.48]Alright, so... Dismantling.
[99:51.84]Dismantling items.
[99:53.47]Dismantling items.
[99:55.05]It sounded really bad being... It sounded bad.
[99:57.27]Okay.
[99:57.87]I have to show you guys.
[100:00.20]Okay, so I've got these... I've got the Dancer's Daggers.
[100:08.97]And these things are dual welding.
[100:12.54]If you put them on two slots with one character, the Shadow Striker,
[100:19.53]It's not even your class.
[100:20.69]I know.
[100:21.25]I blanked over that because it's not even my class.
[100:27.42]What do I even have right now?
[100:39.67]Yeah, that thing's way better.
[100:45.76]Was it really bad what I said?
[100:49.31]I mean, like... I think I just described it wrong.
[100:52.64]Oh, okay, so it wasn't that bad.
[100:54.06]Yeah.
[100:54.22]No, it's... No, it was bad?
[100:56.44]You gotta trust me.
[100:57.96]What am I trusting you about?
[100:58.84]The sexual abuse?
[101:01.53]No, no.
[101:03.27]I believe you, it happened.
[101:08.29]Alright, we're gonna be doing a new mission.
[101:10.86]Okay.
[101:15.04]It's bad.
[101:19.50]Dismantle.
[101:21.55]Dismantle.
[101:28.46]Should I not be doing that?
[101:30.20]I feel like I should be keeping these.
[101:31.72]I think dismantling freely is good, but they kind of add up.
[101:38.45]It takes a while to get through everything.
[101:40.82]You can also mass mark them and dismantle at once.
[101:53.51]I think I'm going no helm.
[101:56.87]Can you toggle the helm in options?
[101:57.95]I feel like it's probably a thing.
[102:01.43]Yeah.
[102:03.28]Where is that?
[102:04.44]Go to your loadout and then left click on the bumper.
[102:08.88]Or click down on your left bumper.
[102:11.08]You go no helm.
[102:15.35]Um... Rewind?
[102:17.41]That's much better.
[102:19.11]Yeah, I just talked to my community.
[102:21.31]It's an Arabic thing.
[102:23.49]That's what I said.
[102:24.23]We're just going to move on.
[102:27.00]When I press left bumper, it brings up options.
[102:28.48]We're already over.
[102:29.38]We're past it.
[102:30.58]Oh, you mean the left stick.
[102:33.82]Yeah.
[102:34.86]Oh, not bumper.
[102:35.30]Sorry.
[102:35.58]My bad.
[102:36.03]That's my bad.
[102:36.53]Sorry.
[102:36.73]It's the meds.
[102:38.07]Yeah.
[102:39.05]Thanks.
[102:39.49]Yeah.
[102:39.63]It's the meds I'm on.
[102:45.85]I need more stuff to dismantle.
[102:49.84]Loves upgrading so much.
[102:52.43]Well, we can get stuff to dismantle on the next mission.
[102:58.42]Huh?
[102:59.14]How far away are we from the Blitzenfell cops thing?
[103:01.90]I feel like we're pretty close.
[103:02.64]Or maybe like one or two fights away.
[103:05.09]Yeah.
[103:07.49]We're right there.
[103:08.73]I just got off the phone with the devs.
[103:09.77]I gotta give them 20 more minutes.
[103:13.16]Is it the ball thing?
[103:14.58]Yeah.
[103:15.74]Oh, man.
[103:16.34]Well, we got 20 more minutes anyways.
[103:18.30]Yeah.
[103:19.06]We still have 20 minutes.
[103:21.51]Yo, same time tomorrow?
[103:23.77]I mean, yeah.
[103:27.06]Oh, this actually is where we need to be alright.
[103:28.70]Are you guys ready to do this?
[103:31.04]Ready to do this.
[103:38.71]Yes, wait.
[103:40.81]I'm one behind.
[103:41.59]Or we could just start.
[103:45.96]Are you already?
[103:48.30]I'm ready to to lay down.
[103:51.85]Okay.
[103:52.11]Absolute smackdown.
[104:00.52]On me old gobos.
[104:01.90]Let's get a huddle before the next mission.
[104:03.70]Alright, you got it.
[104:04.22]Everybody, hands in.
[104:08.21]I'm gonna take down the, uh, we're gonna take down the Lichenfell Cop's boss.
[104:12.77]And we're gonna do it fast, we're gonna do it swiftly.
[104:16.01]And I gotta get a one, two, three, break!
[104:18.88]Break.
[104:19.33]Break.
[104:19.95]Break.
[104:20.17]Oh, one, two, three.
[104:21.49]Boss.
[104:21.97]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[104:23.19]One, two, three.
[104:26.08]Break.
[104:26.80]Oh, we can just do it right now.
[104:28.26]It's just letting me walk there.
[104:29.90]It's just letting me skip.
[104:31.40]I think we did a bunch of these in a row, didn't we?
[104:35.59]There's another Glorp.
[104:38.35]Alien Glorp.
[104:39.84]Alien Glorp and Glorpette.
[104:41.58]I found my guy.
[104:43.58]What?
[104:46.83]You don't see him?
[104:48.53]Prince Prince right next to me?
[104:50.20]You don't see alien glow?
[104:52.08]Oh, okay.
[104:52.50]I do.
[104:54.68]Aw.
[104:56.75]Mine, uh... I don't know.
[104:58.17]Mine hits better.
[105:01.69]He doesn't even have the ears.
[105:03.09]Like, he's not even trying.
[105:05.64]This is a 131 gear score.
[105:07.58]The extra one on the end really does it.
[105:14.37]Guys, I'm ready.
[105:15.51]Oh, never mind.
[105:19.94]Hey, did you get a game sponsor deal and convince these others to play?
[105:23.28]Don't they know he's getting paid?
[105:26.37]Uh, well, I've got news for you.
[105:28.31]Every single person on this call has their own sponsor deal with this game.
[105:33.91]Thank you, Stoic.
[105:35.51]Thanks for reading that one guy's comment.
[105:40.10]Pick a nice one.
[105:40.78]It was my comment.
[105:43.74]Yeah, Poke, you wrote that.
[105:44.80]What happened?
[105:50.62]I just read the DMs.
[105:51.38]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[106:00.91]I think we actually have a real boss at the end of this, by the way.
[106:02.95]Like a real one.
[106:04.45]Like a boss boss?
[106:05.57]A boss boss.
[106:07.84]So try to save your health drinks.
[106:17.03]The trips.
[106:21.41]Watch over the trip.
[106:42.52]I understand the fire guy now.
[106:45.07]I'm on fire.
[106:46.45]You firing up?
[106:47.85]Ow!
[107:01.09]Seems nice to have gun mode.
[107:03.17]I don't know how to shoot, though, whenever I want.
[107:06.77]Just kind of random.
[107:07.90]Is it part of your meter?
[107:08.68]I think it's, like, combo-related, yeah.
[107:12.68]But you can charge up your meter and then spend it.
[107:23.63]I just punched that guy out of this world.
[107:27.68]One dash two now.
[107:36.95]Whoa, you send them high.
[107:39.43]See that?
[107:45.80]Ultimate dopamine to hit the guys in the air.
[107:50.97]The higher you hit them, the more dope.
[107:54.33]Watch out.
[107:55.79]Watch out.
[107:56.31]I think I've asked you guys this before.
[107:58.74]Can you guys juggle?
[108:01.42]no I've tried so many times every week with this dude what is this a frequent question is it because you can juggle and you want to bring it up I can't juggle that we got that all sorted out no can't juggle sorry for trying to get to know you guys
[108:32.74]juggle in this game hey yeah in a combat related sense very sure my brain just can't do it I I start doing it I throw one or two in the air and then as the second one oh my goodness I freak out actually yeah this is not good no I did not kill the vibes
[109:02.82]I mean, you put it into question when you say that in that volume.
[109:09.03]That's funny.
[109:09.75]It's like, no, I did not kill the vibes.
[109:16.52]Vibes are fine.
[109:17.40]Hey, the vibe meter is slowly rising back.
[109:21.05]We're good.
[109:21.77]The vibe meter is back.
[109:23.63]That implies.
[109:25.05]I mean, the vibe meter took a slight hit of damage, I think.
[109:27.99]It did a tiny bit.
[109:28.72]I'm not thinking about the things I can't do that I wish I could.
[109:30.98]We're good.
[109:32.32]Like, laugh.
[109:32.82]I remember when I used to laugh.
[109:34.44]That was fun.
[109:38.29]If you laugh, this will be all okay.
[109:39.79]You need to laugh, bro.
[109:41.05]I can't laugh.
[109:41.65]I can't juggle.
[109:43.05]What am I even doing here, guys?
[109:44.85]That's got a blue.
[109:48.54]Thanks for... You know what?
[109:49.86]That is something to celebrate.
[109:50.80]It kind of is.
[109:52.44]I've only gotten two of those.
[109:58.79]You got two blues at all?
[110:02.05]I think I've only gotten like two of them.
[110:03.48]Have you guys gotten more than two or three?
[110:04.82]Are you you?
[110:06.08]Is everyone here colorblind?
[110:08.50]There's no way you only got two.
[110:09.96]I'm telling you, I've only gotten like three.
[110:13.01]Oh, you need better RNG.
[110:14.91]I like the backgrounds.
[110:15.95]The backgrounds are really pretty.
[110:24.82]Group them up.
[110:25.34]I'm about to juggle.
[110:27.24]Okay.
[110:28.36]Grouping.
[110:29.66]And I'm gonna, I'm gonna bunch them.
[110:36.16]There was no juggle.
[110:37.72]Yeah.
[110:39.84]I was ready with the follow-up.
[110:43.23]Somebody just asked me, would I eat a smurf?
[110:45.07]No, that's the same thing as a gnome to me.
[110:49.30]I think Gargamel is on something, man.
[110:51.60]It definitely got to be magic.
[110:54.94]And they look tasty.
[111:06.84]Yeah, that's the same category as a gnome for me.
[111:08.40]I couldn't.
[111:08.82]No way.
[111:14.77]They don't like being lumped into the same archetype, mind you.
[111:20.22]Well, I for one would eat both of them regardless of their similarities.
[111:24.71]So it makes me the better person.
[111:34.29]It just hit me again that you are playing right now in a neck brace.
[111:38.96]Yes.
[111:40.15]It's actually really warm.
[111:41.71]It's kind of comfy.
[111:42.29]I might do this more often.
[111:44.52]It's the big turtleneck.
[111:47.06]Yeah.
[111:49.38]I feel like with a neck brace, you could really just go to sleep anywhere.
[111:53.09]That's basically, you have those for the plane, you know?
[111:55.44]Oh my God, you're right.
[111:58.34]I mean, if I'm like taking this out of my like little luggage on a plane, I feel like the most extra person.
[112:03.60]Well, no, you wear it there.
[112:05.56]we're on the way the entire time through security and then at like any point uh you could ask someone to help you with your luggage and they'll like oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah you're right I get so much free stuff I'd like go to the McDonald's I'm like oh life hack faint I just have this
[112:25.27]And you do the thing where you turn your whole body with your shoulders, not your neck, where you're like, oh, yeah, I just, I kind of... Yeah.
[112:32.48]You do the Darth Vader.
[112:33.48]That's a great way to put it.
[112:34.78]The Darth Vader pivoting.
[112:43.09]I, like, go to the security checkpoint to tell you to put your hands above your head, and I go, oh, I don't want to.
[112:50.38]They're like, you've just gone through, sir.
[112:55.18]Oh, I didn't touch the thing.
[112:57.16]I don't think I used the potion, though.
[113:01.72]You guys use potions?
[113:02.91]You're ready.
[113:03.39]Yeah.
[113:03.53]Not really.
[113:04.39]Cherry kill on two right now.
[113:07.73]Hey, one minute, by the way, guys.
[113:10.11]One minute.
[113:11.50]Why are you potion watching me?
[113:15.00]I don't know.
[113:15.58]I just looked at the top.
[113:23.89]One minute.
[113:24.19]Two more tents.
[113:29.04]One more over here.
[113:33.61]So did you guys get different right trigger spell abilities?
[113:37.43]Us.
[113:38.55]Or did I not do that?
[113:39.87]Big juggle.
[113:41.62]Oh, man.
[113:42.88]Hey, we got to get up here.
[113:44.46]We got to go.
[113:48.30]Big boss.
[113:50.53]Big juggle.
[113:52.49]I messed up.
[113:52.85]Never mind.
[113:53.19]Play with the adds.
[113:53.77]Play with the adds.
[113:58.19]Yeah, that's what I say every time I watch your stream.
[114:01.77]You've run ads too.
[114:02.74]What are you talking about?
[114:21.88]If you ate a gnome, I'd eat a gnome.
[114:24.70]If we were together.
[114:26.08]Yeah.
[114:27.14]If you're pressured, you're into it.
[114:28.48]No, it's not even social pressure.
[114:29.81]More like just camaraderie.
[114:32.83]Oh.
[114:33.47]There's a distinction there, right?
[114:36.23]I guess one sounds nicer.
[114:37.95]Thank you.
[114:40.05]Can I parry those?
[114:42.56]I can.
[114:45.38]I think you just stand on me and rez.
[114:47.98]No.
[114:49.62]No, night reigning.
[114:51.43]I can't say that word.
[114:53.35]Why are you not... Glarpet, excuse me.
[114:56.13]We have a situation here where a boss is currently fighting Criken alone.
[115:00.42]Oh, Criken's like level 40.
[115:03.26]Not level 40.
[115:03.94]I appreciate your confidence.
[115:11.75]If you think Criken's powerful in this, you should see him in an RP server.
[115:17.72]I got him again.
[115:23.44]Damage dealt.
[115:31.95]Ooh.
[115:33.99]Oh my god.
[115:37.26]Ooh.
[115:38.84]I just die every day.
[115:42.31]Here we go.
[115:42.77]Finish it.
[115:44.61]Why do you keep punching me?
[115:46.43]I killed you.
[115:49.64]Nicely done.
[115:52.42]Ow!
[115:53.53]That's like we beat the boss you jumped on barbed wire I don't know why we just beat the boss and then you decided to swallow a grenade I went lightheaded like bad I
[116:21.19]Look at his face!
[116:22.69]Wait, look at everyone's faces!
[116:24.79]What the hell's going on?
[116:29.82]You made that face, Criken.
[116:31.70]What?
[116:32.50]Your character is so cool.
[116:34.45]Oh my god, I spent half the time punching you while you were dead and we have like the same damage dealt.
[116:39.56]Bro, I'm level... I'm low level.
[116:43.84]Well, no, that's a detriment to me.
[116:51.17]I tried to make my character look like they're from Tintin.
[116:53.48]Did you guys ever read Tintin when you were a kid?
[116:55.62]Oh, that's a classic.
[116:57.84]No.
[116:58.58]That's the one that goes, Tintin, Tintin, Tintin, Tintin, Tintin, Tintin, Tintin, Tintin, Tintin, Tintin, Tintin, Tintin.
[117:07.11]Right?
[117:09.67]Yes.
[117:10.91]And I love that part of the show and movie.
[117:15.84]Is the server down?
[117:17.62]I'm still in.
[117:19.25]It said I'm now the group leader, which I already was.
[117:24.52]Steam maintenance?
[117:25.78]Me and Jerm are usually stream when there's steam maintenance.
[117:27.80]Oh my god, you're right.
[117:28.86]Actually might be.
[117:30.42]It might be steam maintenance.
[117:32.37]Oh wow.
[117:32.75]That seems like a normal thing that we do.
[117:35.01]Actually kind of weirdly perfect timing though, because it's been almost exactly two hours, but... We did beat the big boss.
[117:42.62]We're playing more of this later, right?
[117:45.80]We are playing more of this tomorrow.
[117:48.18]Tomorrow?
[117:49.98]Yeah, let's do it.
[117:51.86]Yeah, time flew by quick, honestly.
[117:54.25]Yeah, I would play more right now.
[117:57.25]I'm enjoying it.
[117:59.25]I like punching things.
[118:00.19]I want to upgrade.
[118:02.12]This dude needs to upgrade.
[118:06.50]Did you can't tell me how you able to with the server with steam?
[118:10.35]I I'm still in a server of some kind.
[118:13.25]I'm in now.
[118:14.65]Mine's weird.
[118:15.17]It's not letting me go into the belfry.
[118:17.52]Well, it's nice it didn't kick us while we were in that mission.
[118:20.15]Yeah, that's good.
[118:25.11]Yeah, it is like prime time on a Tuesday.
[118:28.04]I'm going to write Gabe in an email.
[118:35.17]I just don't get it.
[118:38.95]Hey, by the way, you know you can mark things for dismantle so you don't have to do it individually.
[118:45.52]Yes.
[118:46.44]Why are you reading our chat?
[118:49.80]I'm just trying to help you out.
[118:51.89]Thanks.
[119:01.18]I kind of like seeing everyone's character.
[119:04.64]Because you really can do so much in the character creator.
[119:07.49]Yeah, I thought it was great.
[119:09.65]It's a pretty unique style too.
[119:13.04]Keep a couple of these.
[119:16.43]Thank you, Stoick!
[119:19.32]Yeah.
[119:19.94]Thank you, Stoick.
[119:23.88]Or, Ster?
[119:24.12]Ster, I haven't heard you say anything.
[119:26.39]Here's what I'm gonna say.
[119:27.37]Check out the trailer.
[119:28.51]I think Ashley did art in it.
[119:32.41]I have to check.
[119:33.09]I have to watch it.
[119:34.04]Oh, shit.
[119:34.80]Really?
[119:35.48]Wait, really?
[119:35.90]Yeah, I think that there's one background that is of the Belfry that she drew.
[119:39.56]Oh, that's amazing.
[119:40.91]Oh, shit.
[119:41.23]That's really cool.
[119:42.81]Wait, what?
[119:44.48]I gotta see I'm gonna mute and watch it real quick the trailer I'll watch it too let's watch it I'll put it up uh I actually have it right here oh
[120:12.46]I want to watch there it is uh let me turn the volume down a lot for a second just make sure because I didn't pre-bake this so hold on
[120:47.64]Let me get it and we can watch it.
[120:53.61]Oh, that was actually sick.
[121:15.00]Okay.
[121:34.60]Cool.
[122:03.95]Oh, that's the gun.
[122:05.41]That's the gun.
[122:07.64]Fire class guy.
[122:10.43]So what background Ster were you talking about?
[122:12.61]A lot of really pretty backgrounds.
[122:41.40]Very cool.
[122:52.18]I'm the only one not muted.
[122:54.42]Probably fucking annoying.
[122:56.50]I'm like, oh, ooh, okay.
[122:58.09]Hmm.
[122:59.49]So, which one was it?
[123:00.67]Everyone's watching this.
[123:01.93]I'm the only one in the call not muted.
[123:03.38]I just realized.
[123:15.91]But again, yeah, before we're pretty much at time here, I want to do a little bit more character customization.
[123:21.24]Alright, guys, I think I'm going to bounce.
[123:22.58]I've got to play something else.
[123:25.08]But I will see you tomorrow.
[123:26.15]Yeah, see you tomorrow.
[123:28.93]I had a lot of fun today.
[123:29.55]See you tomorrow.
[123:32.80]Thanks for putting up with the...
[123:36.04]Ah, fuck.
[123:36.84]Alright.
[123:37.40]No, dude.
[123:38.10]Actually, it was a great arc.
[123:39.24]It was a great story arc.
[123:40.44]It was a whole bunch of drama next to it.
[123:42.80]I loved it.
[123:43.90]I'll bring the drama tomorrow, too.
[123:45.95]I have one more steroid pill.
[123:48.49]I honestly hope you feel better.
[123:50.01]All jokes aside, that doesn't sound fun, so I hope you feel better, dude.
[123:53.91]Thanks, man.
[123:54.47]Yeah, it's been rough, but we'll get through it.
[123:58.08]Feel better, brother.
[123:59.84]Alright, see you guys tomorrow.
[124:00.92]See you guys tomorrow.
[124:05.38]Bye.

[124:06.46]Bye, guys.
[124:07.80]You missed the goodbye.
[124:10.09]I did miss the goodbye.
[124:14.35]I like the game.
[124:17.64]I wonder tomorrow how far we get because I feel like we just kind of opened up some new cool stuff to do.
[124:23.82]We're going to open up tomorrow and Jerma's going to be level 20.
[124:27.59]No.
[124:28.93]Let me video call you guys later and show you what I meant earlier because out of context, it sounded crazy.
[124:35.22]My bad.
[124:36.34]I know what you're talking about.
[124:38.10]I just think there's a time and a place.
[124:40.20]Yeah, my fault.
[124:42.11]I was having so much fun.
[124:43.21]That was a thing.
[124:44.87]You know, I can't relate to that thing.
[124:47.47]Sorry, I was having too much fun.
[124:49.74]We're having fun.
[124:50.88]It's all good.
[124:51.58]Don't worry.
[124:53.66]Lesson learned.
[124:55.75]Hey, live, laugh, love.
[124:56.57]It's my first sponsor.
[124:59.45]Yeah, it can be nerve-wracking, man.
[125:03.97]Alright, well, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[125:05.79]Yeah, I take it easy.
[125:08.40]Bye guys.
[125:11.38]Have fun playing in our graders.
[125:13.14]He didn't hear the joke.
[125:15.33]That would have made him sad.
[125:18.19]Why you want to make him sad?
[125:19.27]I don't.
[125:20.55]I don't know.
[125:25.16]I want to do one more thing in the game.
[125:27.24]As I want to be ready to play tomorrow.
[125:32.34]Oh, he's going to upgrade it?
[125:33.94]I want to do... I just want to... I want to take a look.
[125:37.51]Okay.
[125:37.69]What's this?
[125:38.99]What are you doing?
[125:39.53]What's your deal?
[125:40.39]Because I was thinking about... Oh, I can turn this in.
[125:44.14]My chat really wants to hear about this one singular white knuckle.
[125:49.88]What do they want to hear?
[125:52.27]I don't know.
[125:52.57]There was mention that there might be white knuckle, and I'm on hold.
[125:56.29]Oh.
[125:57.68]There was an idea of me watching you play white knuckle.
[126:01.67]I watched your stream after last night absolutely tragic you showed up and were so happy and excited and you got obliterated yeah that's the way it is that's the game's hard I think you would roll it if you played again on a fresh like one one run fresh I think you would crush
[126:31.25]I don't know.
[126:32.37]I feel like I've got to be ready to go with that.
[126:35.64]I don't know if I'm ready to play.
[126:37.68]No, I'm telling you.
[126:38.80]First session, first one, you weren't ready.
[126:41.09]You're goofing, you're laughing.
[126:44.86]I don't know, man.
[126:45.68]Unless you're traumatized.
[126:46.84]I told you it was very stressful.
[126:49.60]I understand if you're traumatized.
[126:50.83]Look at this thing.
[126:55.74]Um.
[126:57.70]I don't know.
[126:58.02]Maybe do you want to do that tomorrow?
[126:59.66]I kind of want to play Dracula.
[127:00.80]I feel like I've promised people Dracula for a very long time.
[127:03.29]Do you want to screen share?
[127:06.15]White knuckle or whatever you want.
[127:07.21]I'm just figuring it out so I I don't know what I'm doing at all.
[127:12.10]Because we're doing this tomorrow, so maybe after tomorrow, because I'm just not in like a go really fast white knuckle kind of mood and more of a chill and watch Dracula be funny.
[127:26.92]Dracula is not funny.
[127:28.00]He's serious.
[127:29.04]True.
[127:29.70]He's dangerous.
[127:30.62]But tomorrow after the... When we do the sponsor again.
[127:34.65]Towerborn Part 2.
[127:36.01]After Part 2 Towerborn, I would love to watch you play White Knuckle.
[127:40.32]And then maybe do a few runs myself.
[127:43.54]You first, then me.
[127:45.26]Okay.
[127:45.42]I'm telling you on a fresh brain, you've got it.
[127:49.87]Okay.
[127:50.91]I think you can even beat the elevator shaft.
[127:53.67]Oh, my God.
[127:54.61]You think so?
[127:55.37]I don't know.
[127:55.69]I've only seen it once.
[127:56.49]I think you'll beat it.
[127:59.15]You even got so screwed there that you didn't get a revive.
[128:03.36]Because you didn't have four bugs.
[128:05.08]Everything went wrong for you.
[128:07.08]And it was rough.
[128:08.28]Okay.
[128:08.58]I feel bad.
[128:09.61]Alright.
[128:09.89]Well, I had fun doing it.
[128:14.19]Alright.
[128:14.43]Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
[128:15.51]Yeah.
[128:15.83]See you tomorrow, dude.
[128:16.67]Take care, man.
[128:17.47]Love you.
[128:19.22]Right?
[128:19.68]He didn't even stay for me.
[128:20.66]You know what?
[128:20.96]I'm not going to say it back because he didn't even stay for me to say it.
[128:24.43]Alright, let me get this.
[128:27.21]Because I want to see.
[128:27.86]What do I have equipped right now?
[128:33.34]One is... Okay, 73.
[128:38.17]Which one should I upgrade?
[128:39.25]I want to be ready tomorrow.
[128:44.04]Bleed damage.
[128:44.98]I'll keep this one.
[128:46.88]Yeah.
[128:48.16]I want to upgrade that one.
[128:50.89]And then I'll be ready.
[128:52.07]Yeah, I think it's fun.
[128:54.05]Again, thank you Stoic for the sponsor.
[128:56.40]I do want to give just a little bit of extra time here just because I know we took about 5 to 10 minutes to get ready.
[129:00.64]85 damage.
[129:06.87]Let's go.
[129:09.97]Yeah, the free-to-play is going through tomorrow.
[129:12.84]Or till tomorrow.
[129:14.36]If you want to check it out, absolutely.
[129:16.04]Go for it.
[129:17.72]As you can see, if you have some friends, it's fun just to kind of
[129:22.28]Talk a bunch of shit and just hang out and play.
[129:24.24]It's just a fun game to have on.
[129:27.69]It's on Game Pass.
[129:28.97]It is on Xbox.
[129:29.97]It is on Steam.
[129:34.02]Seems like there's a fair amount of... Let me look at the map, too.
[129:36.24]I just wanted to take a look at the map.
[129:40.41]You can do it solo, too.
[129:41.17]You don't need to do it with people.
[129:43.63]It looks like there's a bunch of people that are walking around, too.
[129:48.56]Let me see how big the map is.
[129:51.71]Reminds me of some old side-scrolling brawlers.
[129:54.95]I feel like that's probably where a lot of the inspiration is, is just kind of jump into a game with some friends and just kill a bunch of stuff.
[130:03.43]Oh, right.
[130:04.33]The connection is messed up, but... Yeah, that was Towerborn.
[130:13.06]The one thing I want to do tomorrow is I got to figure... I want to figure this out before tomorrow.
[130:17.53]I want to figure out how to open... I have a few of these.
[130:20.36]See in the top left?
[130:21.06]I have four of these.
[130:21.74]I want to figure out how to use these because I want to actually use them for something.
[130:31.77]But we'll see.
[130:32.79]I'm going to take a break.
[130:33.51]I'll be back.
[130:34.77]And we're going to open up Dracula 3, which took me a million years to get working.
[130:38.82]Give me a few minutes, though.
[130:39.54]Give me like five minutes, ten minutes.
[130:41.44]I'll come back and we'll continue the stream.
[130:43.53]Thank you again, Stoic, for the sponsor.
[130:45.79]I'll be right back.
[130:54.64]Also, I wanted to mention, I am probably going to run ads again to turn the pre-rolls off.
[131:00.41]So...
[131:02.70]We will hop out of here and we'll go back to the regularly scheduled breaks.
[131:09.31]I will be right back.
