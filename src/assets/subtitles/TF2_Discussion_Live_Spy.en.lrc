[00:01.74]Hey, what is happening, guys?
[00:03.24]Jerma here with a live Team Fortress 2 commentary.
[00:06.32]Gonna try and play Spy.
[00:09.10]Don't ask me how good this is going to go, because as you know, I need very, very high amounts of concentration whenever I play Spy, especially whenever I play this game in general.
[00:19.97]But this is not a good start.
[00:22.25]Oh, let me get by there.
[00:24.41]Did I get by?
[00:24.93]I did.
[00:27.08]And a one.
[00:28.10]And a two.
[00:29.00]And a three.
[00:30.94]Get off that point.
[00:32.86]Give me this medic.
[00:34.14]Got ya.
[00:35.08]Got ya.
[00:36.48]No.
[00:36.90]No.
[00:37.22]Wait.
[00:37.58]What?
[00:38.10]Wait.
[00:38.54]Whoa.
[00:38.90]Whoa.
[00:39.20]Whoa.
[00:39.40]Whoa.
[00:39.66]Whoa.
[00:39.98]What just happened?
[00:41.80]Did they really?
[00:44.31]What?
[00:45.91]Oh my god.
[00:47.87]Okay.
[00:48.17]Well, they already capped the point and they almost... That was bad.
[00:53.09]Oh god.
[00:53.59]Can I get like nine kills right here?
[00:56.41]One.
[00:57.15]Come on.
[00:58.61]Just pull it out.
[00:59.39]Pull it out.
[00:59.73]You're good.
[01:00.32]You're okay.
[01:00.84]You're okay.
[01:02.60]So anyways, give me that.
[01:03.96]Oh, you piece... You goddamn bastard.
[01:07.42]You... Oh, boy.
[01:10.48]I'm in trouble.
[01:12.61]I'm in total trouble.
[01:13.55]Come on.
[01:14.15]Come on.
[01:14.45]Jump around long enough so I can get the... Come on.
[01:16.75]Come on.
[01:17.43]Come on.
[01:17.85]Yes.
[01:20.53]Oh, yes.
[01:22.17]This... Yeah.
[01:23.01]Okay.
[01:23.17]There we go.
[01:23.58]There we go.
[01:25.48]Okay, so now I'm going to go as a sniper.
[01:27.58]Give me some health.
[01:30.12]I'm just a sniper.
[01:31.74]I'm just a sniper there, buddy.
[01:33.46]Oh, God.
[01:34.96]I don't want to find myself in any hell.
[01:38.85]No, he's healing me.
[01:40.11]Good.
[01:43.53]Keep it up.
[01:44.01]Keep it up.
[01:44.49]Keep it up.
[01:44.91]I'm not doing too bad.
[01:47.09]Usually, guys, when I... You guys know this.
[01:49.93]Live commentary and me, it's pretty much the worst thing ever.
[01:54.72]Got you.
[01:57.17]Oh, playing the default Spy Revolver, the Dead Ringer, and the Stinger.
[02:03.50]And I am shocked that I'm doing this well, guys.
[02:07.46]Shocked.
[02:08.92]Oh, come on.
[02:11.70]Oh, come on.
[02:12.62]Come on, let me get a backstab.
[02:14.02]Come on!
[02:14.83]Get over here!
[02:15.79]No, get out of my way!
[02:17.61]Oh, you've ruined everything, Dr. T. I would have backstabbed that Medic.
[02:23.69]But yeah, very, very shocking that I'm doing this well.
[02:27.57]Because live commentary... I'm just an idiot.
[02:31.79]So what do I want to talk about today?
[02:34.49]One thing.
[02:35.69]The one thing I want to talk about in this game while I fail as Spy is kind of important.
[02:41.94]It has to do with the fact that Team Fortress 2... I really, really... In the very, very most sincere way... I really hope that Team Fortress comes out with a very large update...
[02:55.21]in the next couple weeks.
[02:56.83]Because if this Christmas update is just a bunch of hats and a bunch of miscellaneous items and what?
[03:03.45]Miscellaneous items and stuff like that, then Team Fortress 2 as we know it is starting to die.
[03:10.76]And that's not me saying I'll never play Team Fortress ever again.
[03:13.66]That's not me saying that Team Fortress isn't fun.
[03:16.24]It's just been a very, very, very long time since they came out with any updates for any items.
[03:23.32]Sure, they've done a lot of little bug patches and they've done hat updates.
[03:27.42]But I will say it right now, if the Christmas update does not have any actual real items, then Team Fortress 2 is starting to die.
[03:36.75]And it's unfortunate, but that really is the truth.
[03:38.61]Because guys, you've got to remember, it's been...
[03:41.45]It's been almost, I'm just running into piss and getting myself killed.
[03:44.75]So let's see, August, September, October, November, December.
[03:48.11]It's been four months since we have seen any real items.
[03:53.44]Almost, coming on five months.
[03:56.20]So if it's gonna take the Valve team almost half a year to implement new items into this game, things aren't really looking so hot.
[04:05.91]That's why I'm really, really hoping to God that this big Christmas update they're talking about, using the Steam Workshop and the Steam Store and stuff like that, hopefully it's a very big deal.
[04:17.72]Here's a teleporter here.
[04:18.68]Are you serious?
[04:20.12]Can I get rid of it before I die?
[04:21.60]How did that pyro not see me?
[04:24.44]Whatever.
[04:24.78]That should get rid of the... That guy just flew right back into my knife.
[04:31.95]Oh, that was sick.
[04:33.95]Well...
[04:35.79]But this is me hoping so much that it happens.
[04:38.99]Because I'm scared.
[04:39.75]Alright, let's see.
[04:42.57]Can I do something?
[04:46.29]Now, Team Fortress 2 will never die.
[04:49.85]It absolutely will never die.
[04:52.09]Oh, come on.
[04:54.83]Oh, come on.
[04:56.09]It absolutely will never die.
[04:58.54]I'm talking more in the sense of Valve putting development time into the game.
[05:04.84]Because Gabe Newell said a long time ago, and even like Robin Walker, all of the guys that are involved in Team Fortress, they said that they wanted to turn Team Fortress 2 over to the community.
[05:16.95]They wanted to give Team Fortress 2 to the community.
[05:19.71]All these items, the Steam Workshop is supposed to be their starting point of Valve giving Team Fortress 2 to the community.
[05:28.61]Where, okay, here's a bunch of items.
[05:30.19]You guys pick the ones you want in, and then we'll put them in.
[05:33.13]And that's been going on for a while, and we haven't seen anything.
[05:37.78]So I'm just curious as to how many people I can backstab right now.
[05:42.56]One.
[05:44.33]No!
[05:47.13]Shit.
[05:51.91]We're about to lose the game.
[05:55.12]We are gonna lose right now.
[05:57.36]Oh, no!
[05:58.92]No!
[06:00.64]Get out there, my brethren.
[06:02.72]Get out there, my brethren, and protect the point.
[06:07.38]Yeah, they didn't get it.
[06:08.66]Spy, oh god.
[06:11.57]Gotta pull out the Dead Ringer.
[06:14.03]Question is, can I... Come on, come on, come on.
[06:21.05]Oh, my goodness.
[06:22.64]Alright, we're good, we're good.
[06:25.24]Look it, I'm on your team.
[06:30.14]Are they still looking for me?
[06:32.04]Oh, man.
[06:33.80]Oh, man.
[06:37.22]That's the guy I'm disguised as right here.
[06:38.92]He's right underneath me right now.
[06:41.74]There he is.
[06:42.16]I'm going for the medic.
[06:45.78]And the heavy.
[06:46.61]And the sniper.
[06:47.73]And the... And the sniper, too.
[06:50.61]And not going to run into a pyro.
[06:52.05]That's bad news.
[06:57.69]Thank you, doctor.
[06:58.85]Whoa!
[07:01.13]One shot, one kill.
[07:03.77]What?
[07:04.43]What?
[07:05.31]What?
[07:07.03]What?
[07:08.36]Still standing right here.
[07:13.20]I keep getting the ammo.
[07:19.76]That was funny.
[07:23.92]Spy sapping my dispenser.
[07:27.07]Oh, he just got... Oh, God.
[07:28.35]Oh, God.
[07:28.79]Oh, God.
[07:29.13]Oh, God.
[07:30.37]Come on.
[07:30.79]Come on.
[07:31.05]Give me my Dead Ringer.
[07:31.93]Give it to me.
[07:32.95]Oh, there he is.
[07:33.51]Hey, what's up, buddy?
[07:34.61]Hey.
[07:38.30]And I went right by him.
[07:41.74]I'm just trolling this guy hard.
[07:43.44]I'm trolling the crap out of this guy.
[07:48.24]Yeah, throw your piss and then get stabbed in the back.
[07:50.92]Whoa.
[07:53.60]Oh, let me drop down.
[07:55.42]Oh, aerial stab.
[08:02.74]Put me out here, doctor.
[08:04.64]Help me out, doctor.
[08:07.12]Oh my god.
[08:08.34]Distractions everywhere.
[08:09.30]Might as well just run up behind everybody.
[08:12.52]No!
[08:13.14]Save the day!
[08:14.04]Save the day!
[08:15.08]I did it!
[08:17.44]Oh, you want to go?
[08:18.38]You want to go?
[08:19.46]You want to go?
[08:22.20]Get behind him!
[08:26.20]Oh, no!
[08:26.92]He needs one shot and he's dead.
[08:30.78]Thank you.
[08:31.48]Jeez.
[08:34.82]This is coming down.
[08:35.82]I can't believe we still have this down.
[08:37.50]Come on, I've just... I got the bushwhacker.
[08:42.81]God damn.
[08:45.11]Well, thank you guys so much for watching.
[08:47.51]I hope you appreciate this fail spy.
[08:50.87]Jerma, the ultimate fail spy.
[08:53.91]We are definitely going to lose right now.
[08:56.59]They're coming.
[08:57.07]Oh, God, it's over.
[08:58.39]It is all over.
[08:59.59]I can't even spawn.
[09:00.31]Let's go.
[09:00.65]Come on.
[09:00.87]Let's do this.
[09:02.01]Going to jump on the point.
[09:03.17]Come on, Spy.
[09:03.81]Wait, what?
[09:06.49]Oh, right.
[09:08.11]Well, thanks, everybody, so much for watching.
[09:10.03]I really do appreciate it.
