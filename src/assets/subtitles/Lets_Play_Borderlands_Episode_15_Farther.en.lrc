[00:10.82]Hello again everybody, this is Lepter1 in Jerma.
[00:13.93]Hello.
[00:14.83]Jerma comes out from the smoke, la de la.
[00:19.51]Hello, you jumped.
[00:20.79]Alright, so, we were just discussing a lot of things that we have to do, and one is to use the map to follow into the diamond, which is right here.
[00:29.58]So shall we?
[00:30.06]Would you like to do the honors?
[00:31.50]Yeah, I initiated the travel.
[00:34.13]Yeah.
[00:35.17]Um, another thing, I have to give you the revolver.
[00:37.75]So I'm going to do that right now.
[00:39.61]Yeah, how do you even trade?
[00:40.79]I don't even know how to trade this game.
[00:43.09]What is up with my... I can't even turn.
[00:45.29]What, are your controls all screwed up?
[00:48.87]Yeah.
[00:52.47]I think my sensitivity got lowered.
[00:53.90]Oh, probably.
[00:55.58]Okay, here, let me try and give you the revolver.
[00:57.68]Where do I throw this?
[00:58.96]Here.
[00:59.14]Now I have to go to tab and then... Jesus Christ.
[01:02.58]I think it's space when you just hover over it and it's space.
[01:05.18]Yeah.
[01:05.42]Alright, so let's see.
[01:09.23]Revolver, revolver, revolver.
[01:11.69]Is that it?
[01:12.59]There we go, I dropped it.
[01:15.58]Where'd it go?
[01:16.62]Oh, it's already gone.
[01:18.54]And we're supposed to use our backpack as to use, so there we go.
[01:22.50]So now we have a lot more space.
[01:26.10]What is this even?
[01:27.21]Ah, shit.
[01:28.49]I just dropped my sniper rifle.
[01:30.11]Hold on, I gotta get that.
[01:31.01]Alright, and I'm supposed to use these, uh... Jesus Christ, what is wrong with this?
[01:38.01]My sensitivity's all screwed up.
[01:44.69]I would I'm just give me a sec here okay go I there we go national and then to you in here too okay so did you arrest me there we don't need that right so and let that stay on the ground we have to go now let's check the map and we have to make our way all the way so we just have to hug the left side yep showing let's move
[02:15.51]How do I initiate that thing?
[02:16.69]F, right?
[02:17.85]And apparently I have to melee when I go out of it.
[02:20.55]Because that does so much more damage.
[02:23.09]And I chose to melee at the wrong time.
[02:24.87]I didn't know that guy was there.
[02:26.71]There's a lot of guys here.
[02:30.51]Bird of prey.
[02:32.69]Oh, by the way, we had to name that thing.
[02:34.99]I saw a few comments saying what you should name it.
[02:39.12]I think the best one was probably... Oh, ouch.
[02:41.80]Holy shit, what did I get shot at?
[02:43.14]Yeah, what is going on?
[02:46.28]I was thinking of picking that thing up, but I don't know if it's good or not.
[02:50.74]Oh, your health is at zero.
[02:52.49]Whoa, what?
[02:52.97]What's going on?
[02:53.63]Oh yeah, and a lot of people said that I can revive you too.
[03:00.35]There we go.
[03:01.25]Yeah, I'll just pick that up.
[03:03.35]I'll use it some other time.
[03:05.37]We're still trying to figure out what weapons are good and what weapons aren't, so if anybody can help us out on that, that'd be great.
[03:12.96]Here, should we just drop down here?
[03:14.80]Let's do it.
[03:15.94]Where am I getting shot at from?
[03:18.66]Oh god, they're all down here.
[03:25.92]Oh god, I'm gonna die.
[03:27.26]Yeah, I got him.
[03:30.39]Did that seriously miss?
[03:39.97]Um, I'm not too hot on health right now.
[03:43.90]And as it looks, neither are you, but let's just continue.
[03:46.70]What level are these guys?
[03:47.88]I don't know, but they're shooting... They're 11.
[03:52.88]They're not even that high.
[03:55.52]What the hell's going on?
[03:57.52]Alright.

[13:59.49]What are the little stars?
[14:00.53]The little stars are transitions.
[14:03.13]Nah, let's go to the far one.
[14:04.93]How do we summon the car?
[14:06.27]Ooh, wrong keys.
[14:07.83]Yeah, somebody told us that we can just get the car when they drive it around.
[14:11.84]Yeah, there we go.
[14:17.60]Let's get out of here.
[14:21.74]Oh, yeah.
[14:22.10]Alright.
[14:23.68]Much faster.
[14:25.88]Oh, that's how you use speed boost.
[14:29.51]You press F. Oh, let's do it.
[14:31.49]Let's speed it up.
[14:33.99]Oh, yeah.
[14:38.37]That's almost unnatural.
[14:41.96]I'm just going to go want to get by these guys.
[14:44.35]Yeah, I'm just shooting random stuff.
[14:45.93]Is this where we're supposed to go?
[14:48.16]Yep.
[14:48.34]Alright, let's get out.
[14:50.16]We got a bunch of stuff we can loot here.
[14:51.70]Yeah, this is a boss, I think, actually, to be honest.
[14:58.77]I'm down.
[15:01.17]Oh!
[15:02.17]A light healing kit?
[15:03.41]What is it?
[15:04.23]It's just, like, some rum or something.
[15:06.23]I don't even know.
[15:07.35]A lot of ammo here.
[15:10.92]Yeah.
[15:11.71]What's good is that some of the ammo that I use, uh, you don't.
[15:15.20]So, and some of the ammo that you use, I don't either, so.
[15:18.41]It's good.
[15:23.20]I really like the art style.
