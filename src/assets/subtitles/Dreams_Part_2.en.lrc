[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.13]Hello, everybody.
[00:05.13]Give me one second.
[00:06.81]And we'll get started.
[00:08.09]Be back in a minute.
[00:10.11]Tweeted something.
[00:12.61]Got my drink.
[01:34.29]Alright.
[01:36.67]So.
[01:37.81]Today.
[01:41.62]We're gonna be playing some Dreams.
[01:43.94]We're gonna try to play Dreams.
[01:46.30]He speaks.
[01:50.16]He speaks, finally.
[01:51.54]Yeah.
[01:52.36]I had to get this shit going here.
[01:53.93]Alright, I'm gonna get... Let me just move my character.
[02:00.35]We can explain what's gonna happen here.
[02:03.47]Okay.
[02:03.61]Okay.
[02:05.01]Let me just get it on the screen because it's already here.
[02:07.51]Sorry, I'm like listening to three things at the same time.
[02:09.97]So today we're going to play Dreams.
[02:11.87]I cannot guarantee that I'm going to be very good at this.
[02:18.32]I did all the tutorials.
[02:20.02]Well, not all of them.
[02:21.26]It actually took a long time.
[02:22.70]So I think I only didn't do one.
[02:25.00]And it was like the master class one.
[02:28.44]So I do know...
[02:32.85]A handful of things.
[02:33.87]Yeah, somebody said it took me eight hours to do them.
[02:36.02]Yeah.
[02:37.34]It's a lot.
[02:38.92]So I am very much at the baby steps.
[02:42.84]I've done the painting advanced tutorial, the sculpt tutorials.
[02:45.70]I know how to use the program now.
[02:49.91]And... And I made something.
[02:53.61]You'll see it in just a second.
[02:56.43]Just learn how to code.
[02:59.15]It really is.
[03:00.75]It is like a... It is absolutely a full game engine.
[03:08.48]It is a full movie maker.
[03:10.04]It's a full game engine.
[03:11.10]It's a full sculpting tool.
[03:12.48]It's like having every single one of these programmed.
[03:19.06]And it's really, really cool.
[03:23.38]Now, what is going to happen today?
[03:26.59]Here's what's gonna happen today.
[03:28.55]I'll tell you.
[03:30.23]This is going to be a... I had a... I don't know, I was trying to think of, like, what to do with it, because... I tried searching.
[03:37.39]Remember I said, oh, I'm gonna look for, like, the tags, or... Uh, search for... Jerma in the title.
[03:44.13]There's... There's nothing.
[03:45.77]Nobody has made anything with the... With Jerma in the title.
[03:50.15]Um... So, there's zero.
[03:53.63]I made something.
[03:56.63]But I do want to learn how to play this.
[04:01.27]And previously, years ago, what I would do is I would just spend two straight weeks in here.
[04:11.30]Making anything I wanted.
[04:12.64]Learning everything, making sure I knew what I was doing.
[04:15.74]It's kind of not possible to do that unless it's kind of broadcasted out.
[04:22.68]You know what I'm saying?
[04:23.78]Because think about it, if I stream, you know, three, four, five days a week, I'm not doing this.
[04:30.32]And it used to be I would just sit here for like 50 hours and do it.
[04:39.09]Don't let your dreams be dreams.
[04:40.75]But, anyways, I'm going to go ahead and show you when have I ever streamed five days a week last week.
[04:49.23]That happened literally last week.
[04:54.44]Anyways.
[04:59.96]Anyways, I'm gonna show you what I have.
[05:03.61]This is the culmination of hours of work.
[05:11.61]I tried my hardest.
[05:13.17]I'm still learning.
[05:20.28]It's not a dunk tank.
[05:26.04]I don't even want to put it on screen.
[05:27.46]I have to, it's so bad.
[05:28.76]Alright.
[05:33.62]Ladies and gentlemen.
[05:36.10]Here is my creation.
[05:38.27]It's called Scorpion Boss.
[05:58.09]Oh shit!
[06:03.91]That wasn't supposed to happen.
[06:05.93]That wasn't supposed to happen yet.
[06:08.39]He wasn't supposed to scream yet.
[06:11.65]But we're gonna dodge roll!
[06:13.07]Let's jump a scorpion!
[06:20.43]No, I did something wrong.
[06:22.49]Because he's supposed to go... Oh shit!
[06:34.36]I beat it!
[06:35.22]I did it.
[06:40.68]That's all I got, that's the only thing I made.
[06:43.74]It's really hard.
[06:44.74]That's so scary.
[06:46.00]Should we do it again?
[06:48.92]Again?
[07:04.96]How many hours was this?
[07:05.92]I don't know, maybe like one?
[07:07.62]Two?
[07:08.14]No, it was like one.
[07:10.32]It didn't take that long.
[07:12.00]Alright, again?
[07:12.64]Alright, again.
[07:14.72]He doesn't even have the health bar.
[07:22.23]Yeah, I beat him first try.
[07:27.07]I beat Jervis Scorpion first try.
[07:29.51]I gotta add some shit.
[07:39.74]This is the first time I haven't played around with the sculpt tool.
[07:41.84]Come on, give me a break.
[07:44.66]What is this music?
[07:45.52]This is Gwyn from Dark Souls.
[07:49.56]Oh, I think I broke it.
[08:00.45]It's the worst thing I ever saw.
[08:01.89]That was literally like, I just had finished the tutorials and I was like, I'm gonna try to do anything.
[08:19.35]There it is.
[08:20.99]No, see, okay, this is literally last, this morning at 2.48 a.m.
[08:28.56]I spent all yesterday doing the tutorials.
[08:33.50]And it culminated here, earlier this morning at 3 a.m.
[08:38.92]Go to sleep, Jeremy.
[08:40.36]I can't, I had to make Jerma Scorpion.
[08:43.81]Anyways, release, I don't think so.
[08:48.43]I'm gonna come back and fix it.
[08:52.55]Alright, so let's go back.
[08:58.09]So.
[09:00.08]Let me explain again what's gonna happen today.
[09:11.32]Hold on, hold on, I need to see that.
[09:14.43]Somebody said the Jerma scorpion face is what the official Jerma985 popsicle would look like.
[09:21.72]An ice cream bar.
[09:44.47]He killed me.
[09:51.03]Oh my god.
[09:57.40]I'm never gonna fucking be able to not- I'm only gonna think about that for the next like 30 minutes.
[10:03.69]Alright, let's- we're gonna start fresh.
[10:06.03]I'm gonna make like- I'm gonna make something really easy.
[10:08.59]I'm gonna make like a rock, okay?
[10:13.96]I need to start small.
[10:15.76]I tried to go way too big here.
[10:17.96]I was going to make like a Dark Souls boss and no, no, no, no.
[10:21.10]I know I got to start small.
[10:22.62]I'm going to make a rock.
[10:26.55]Okay, we're going to do... I'm just going to make a character.
[10:32.07]Although I didn't even do that tutorial.
[10:34.31]Sculpture, sculpture.
[10:36.63]Okay, I'm just going to make a sculpture here.
[10:41.49]I'm going to make a...
[10:45.75]Didn't do that tutorial.
[10:46.85]No, it takes like two days to do these tutorials.
[10:52.49]Okay, I'm going to make a character here, or I'm going to make a sculpture.
[10:56.95]Something that I'm going to try to do as best I can.
[11:01.96]So if you don't know how this works, I didn't show this the last time.
[11:06.54]It's really important.
[11:07.98]Look at how insane this is.
[11:29.30]Probably should have started with a square.
[11:49.52]Oh!
[11:50.74]God damn it!
[11:52.00]Okay.
[11:53.52]Never mind.
[11:54.88]Here's what we're gonna do.
[11:55.60]I'm gonna show you.
[11:56.16]I'm still learning.
[11:58.88]Alright, so anyways.
[12:00.04]The way that this works is you have a literal smear tool that you can paint in three dimensions.
[12:10.27]And guess what?
[12:11.23]You can also take it away, too.
[12:15.73]This is what was blowing my mind, uh, yesterday.
[12:19.56]is this shit.
[12:21.26]Being able to carve out almost like clay is really, really, really fun.
[12:33.46]And you can do this with any shape too.
[12:34.68]And make a Minecraft pig.
[12:43.46]Uh-oh, lagging here.
[12:44.32]Uh-oh.
[12:46.45]Alright, so let's start with... I'm gonna just make... The fucking popsicle thing is killing me.
[12:54.69]I need to stop using the flesh skin color.
[12:57.73]Yeah, but... It... That was like... That was like doctor's office level of realism.
[13:09.02]I don't know what to say about that.
[13:10.18]I really don't.
[13:12.83]That was like image and like sex ed class level of like fucking how perfect it was.
[13:21.94]Let's start simple.
[13:23.00]Okay.
[13:28.21]I'm just going to make like a mountain.
[13:29.59]I'm going to make a mountain.
[13:34.43]Sculpt a frog.
[13:36.41]Well, let me just, because look, ready?
[13:37.93]I can do this.
[13:46.37]Using the controller is kind of finicky, but it's still fun.
[13:54.89]Done!
[13:57.02]I'm done!
[13:58.02]That was fun, huh?
[14:01.28]And there's a way that you can blend this shit together, too.
[14:09.27]Which is what I should be doing.
[14:15.19]Alright, we're going to get... No, no, no.
[14:16.31]This is fine.
[14:16.75]This is fine like this.
[14:17.35]Because, hold on.
[14:22.27]I need to go into here.
[14:25.87]See, if you wonder what this is, this means it's going to do... It's going to be a gradient, essentially.
[14:30.33]I'll show you.
[14:30.83]See?
[14:31.79]It just picks a random color in that gradient.
[14:35.95]It's pretty good.
[14:38.16]Now, you're probably asking, well, these might be too small.
[14:41.02]They're not.
[14:42.26]They are not.
[14:42.66]The great thing about dreams...
[14:45.16]is once these are connected together you can make them as big or small as you want forever they could be an inch tall or they can be 30 feet high 100 feet high alright so but I am just in like the sculpting menu see for instance look at this you ready I can make this as big or as small as I want
[15:13.72]You can start small.
[15:16.27]And, as you see... This is pretty good E3 demo.
[15:22.63]Well, I want to go small, because then we can scale it from there.
[15:27.97]Okay, let's get back in here.
[15:29.77]And I'm going to add... And I'm going to... Jeremy, this is kind of rough looking.
[15:34.44]Don't worry, I'll fix it.
[15:35.98]There's going to be snow.
[15:39.54]Make sure I can make snow here.
[15:42.71]I need a painting tool.
[15:45.31]I'm not done making rocks yet.
[15:47.12]This is just the rock structure.
[15:53.20]Let's go back here.
[15:54.10]Okay, this is just the structure of the rocks.
[15:59.61]I'm going to put some more rocks on it.
[16:04.01]What do I need to do?
[16:04.63]I need to go to... Yep, the smear is fine.
[16:09.71]I need the color to be... We'll do this.
[16:12.73]We'll make it just kind of a random color.
[16:15.35]Random rock type color.
[16:19.71]Oh, shit.
[16:20.77]I want this part of this.
[16:22.17]There we go.
[16:26.92]Okay, so we're going to make little bubbles on it.
[16:29.70]Let's get in there a little closer.
[16:51.56]I mean, you might be asking how it looks a little rough, but it's alright.
[17:05.51]So we're gonna do all kinds of cool shit to this.
[17:13.44]Alright, it's like little puffballs.
[17:16.24]Looks okay.
[17:32.34]Uh, hold on.
[17:34.66]This is snow?
[17:36.02]No.
[17:47.37]It's pustules.
[17:54.65]Is this the snow?
[17:55.29]Was this supposed to be the snow?
[18:07.60]You tell us.
[18:09.34]I'm just experimenting.
[18:10.42]Alright, yeah, it was supposed to be the snow.
[18:12.72]Alright, get in there.
[18:16.41]Except this is going to be different.
[18:17.61]This is going to be different.
[18:19.19]Hold on.
[18:26.00]I want it to be the circle.
[18:27.04]And then we're going to make some snow here, okay?
[18:30.06]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[18:31.08]I need the paint tool.
[18:34.54]Paint mode, I need... What do you think?
[18:37.52]What looks like snow?
[18:39.76]That's kind of snowy.
[18:43.53]Because now this just becomes an object.
[18:48.43]Okay.
[18:51.71]Getting close.
[18:54.93]Let's see here.
[18:55.80]Dots.
[19:01.56]Dots.
[19:05.22]That could be snow.
[19:18.35]And then just sprinkle that around the top.
[19:20.31]Okay.
[19:23.37]What else?
[19:23.69]What are these else?
[19:24.25]I don't even know what these look like.
[19:25.47]This is actually one of the first times I've played with the paint tool.
[19:32.34]No.
[19:32.70]I think this is it.
[19:33.28]I do.
[19:33.88]I do.
[19:39.66]So you can take, uh, you can have it snap to surfaces, you can paint it on surfaces, you can have it, uh, you can put a grid up to have it so you can't really get lost.
[19:48.19]You'll get, like, snapped over and over.
[19:51.73]Or you can do the kaleidoscope tool, which, uh, interestingly enough, um, see what it does here?
[19:58.50]You can kind of make it as many as you want spreading out.
[20:04.24]So you can go do cool stuff like this.
[20:05.88]You can make, like, flowers and shit.
[20:13.12]But we're making snow.
[20:18.05]I think it's going to be dots.
[20:19.03]Maybe I'll make them a little bit... Maybe I'll make them smaller.
[20:23.14]Look, this is just to get into this one thing.
[20:25.18]You know what I'm saying?
[20:27.30]We can take our kaleidoscope.
[20:29.64]I don't really know what this shit does.
[20:36.29]Okay, tools.
[20:38.65]Let's go with the draw flex, because this is more precise.
[20:42.23]And by precise, I mean, if you look, ready, you can start small.
[20:47.85]And the more you hold down right trigger, the bigger the fleck will get.
[20:56.01]So let's go ahead and get over here and paint some snow.
[21:02.92]I'm just gonna... Okay, let's go with... What's a good snow color?
[21:08.22]Maybe white?
[21:10.08]Like teeth white?
[21:14.73]Yeah, it's gonna have to be like teeth white.
[21:16.27]Okay.
[21:18.87]And then let's zoom in a little.
[21:23.17]And I want the dots.
[21:27.45]Now, hold on here.
[21:31.34]How do opacity, scatter... How do opacity, scatter is... No, that looks fine.
[21:43.27]Okay, so let's get in there.
[21:45.01]And make some snow!
[22:01.06]Tilt it a little.
[22:01.68]I think that looks alright.
[22:11.04]Fuck, did I lose my place?
[22:14.50]Why is it blue now?
[22:21.04]Why is it blue?
[22:23.88]Oh, I didn't pick the finish!
[22:25.14]Stupid idiot!
[22:25.76]Alright, plastic.
[22:28.14]Shiny.
[22:29.70]Snow is pretty shiny.
[22:33.58]Yeah, snow is pretty shiny, isn't it?
[22:45.57]Okay.
[22:53.40]Seeing now how difficult this is to do.
[22:56.78]Trying to work in 3D space with a DualShock controller is almost unbearable.
[23:05.50]Why can't I just get down there?
[23:07.32]What the fuck is going on?
[23:13.66]Alright, get over here.
[23:15.42]This is driving me crazy right now.
[23:17.54]Okay, just bring it over here.
[23:23.96]Learn to control it?
[23:24.88]I mean, I know how to control it.
[23:26.12]It's just really hard to use.
[23:27.79]Okay.
[23:38.49]Let's go like this.
[23:51.00]Oh, I need to turn on the snapping for this.
[23:56.40]Wrong thing.
[23:56.82]There it is.
[23:59.36]Obey auto guides?
[24:00.56]Where is it?
[24:02.05]Isn't there... Oh, no, it's not.
[24:04.65]I have to go like this.
[24:05.77]Come here.
[24:08.06]I did make that very small.
[24:31.17]Is that close enough?
[24:32.89]Close enough for a picture.
[24:43.06]I still need to rough this up a little bit.
[24:46.80]Is there a paint to surface?
[24:47.90]There might be, it's just I'm still trying to figure out how the fuck to do this.
[24:51.84]Because there's a sculpt, but then paint is... As I said, this is a complete learning experience for all of us.
[25:05.01]Yeah, there's a snap to surface, which is here.
[25:09.40]Okay, yeah, there it is.
[25:13.52]Well, let's go ahead and do that then.
[25:17.36]Let's get rid of that.
[25:22.02]So let's go back to the dots.
[25:25.12]Make sure the brush fleck is fine.
[25:29.96]Color is not fine.
[25:31.00]Go back to white with a shiny finish.
[25:34.80]And then snap to surface is there.
[25:39.56]Right, okay, here we go.
[26:04.12]Make a massive pig.
[26:06.54]Well, I'm just trying to learn how to use the tools properly.
[26:08.88]I just want to go in and... That's alright.
[26:25.84]But I don't want this to be one object.
[26:27.66]That's what will happen.
[26:37.73]Okay, how's that look?
[26:40.21]I'm just gonna copy it anyways.
[26:43.10]Alright, let's see.
[26:44.12]Alright.
[26:59.53]Three snow things.
[27:02.41]What am I gonna do with this when I finish?
[27:04.21]Throw it in the trash.
[27:08.04]Throw it into the garbage can.
[27:09.26]Alright, that looks alright.
[27:18.38]This has to come up, though.
[27:19.32]I want to change this.
[27:37.07]Let's go out again.
[27:39.37]Into... What is it called?
[27:40.81]You can do style, right?
[27:42.01]Okay, yeah.
[27:43.19]I'm going to drop this a little bit.
[27:49.73]It's going to be an expressionist painting.
[27:55.24]What I'm doing right now is I'm loosening up the fleck, which is kind of another word for pixel.
[28:03.68]That one looks stupid.
[28:05.40]But it don't matter.
[28:09.45]Look at this, see?
[28:10.01]You can make it, um, you can make it a mess.
[28:15.01]That's how you make really fucked up, uh, photos of stuff.
[28:20.43]That looks okay.
[28:21.19]Let's go into... Um... Is Impasto.
[28:27.14]Let's go to Tint.
[28:30.50]I want a better rock look.
[28:34.68]There's Coat Mode, so you can apply... Tints, you can apply finishes.
[28:40.54]Mmm... That looks okay.
[28:52.91]Alright, what about effects?
[28:57.43]Yeah, you can use this.
[28:58.15]The weird part is you can make it move around too.
[29:00.11]So, ready?
[29:02.24]The snow can be, like, moving.
[29:09.48]Alright, well now it's wind.
[29:11.00]It's wind now.
[29:15.71]The rocks are moving too.
[29:21.69]It's just mist now.
[29:23.05]Yeah, no, it is mist.
[29:24.38]Good idea.
[29:25.34]Back it up.
[29:42.73]That's got to be much lighter.
[29:43.63]I'm going to break it up even more.
[29:44.67]Okay, let's get back in.
[29:52.47]I need to paint this again.
[29:53.81]I need to mess this all up.
[29:56.87]Where's the tool that I need for that?
[30:00.35]I think it's actually... Where's the damn tool?
[30:06.15]You can fray it out and really fuck it up.
[30:09.17]Let's see.
[30:11.17]Ruffle, maybe?
[30:13.95]Yep.
[30:15.11]Ruffle.
[30:15.53]Okay.
[30:24.29]You can change the direction.
[30:25.31]Okay.
[30:38.04]Doesn't look terrible.
[30:43.44]And then we're going to paint.
[30:44.32]Let me see.
[30:51.25]This is just, by the way, this is just part one.
[30:58.53]This is, you guys understand that this is the background for a popsicle scene.
[31:07.55]This is what you do.
[31:09.83]You just have to experiment and play around until you find something you like.
[31:17.03]Use the brushes?
[31:17.83]Yeah, here's the one problem, right?
[31:21.50]This is the problem that I had with this stream in particular.
[31:24.78]It takes, like, probably 50 to 100 hours playing this game to know where everything is, know how to do everything, and know exactly how to use every tool.
[31:35.34]There's logic in this game.
[31:39.70]There's actual logic buttons and shit to connect stuff to.
[31:48.34]But I think I just want to try it, you know?
[31:51.67]Add background music?
[31:52.56]Oh, you got it.
[31:53.04]Sure thing.
[32:16.87]Holy shit!
[32:18.63]Whoops!
[32:19.69]See?
[32:20.16]Look at this.
[32:21.64]This is the logic to make this.
[32:24.98]Hold on, how did I... Isn't there a, um...
[32:48.87]I thought I could change the speed.
[32:50.97]Oh no, I definitely can't.
[32:53.99]I have to go over here.
[33:02.95]There it is.
[33:04.41]We can make a song too.
[33:05.85]I'm down with that as well.
[33:07.25]Let's go back here.
[33:17.13]Uh, here we go.
[33:17.67]Playback speed.
[33:18.57]Make the rat song?
[33:20.33]I might be able to, maybe.
[33:22.09]Ah, I hate it.
[33:22.89]I hate it.
[33:23.57]I closed that out.
[33:45.36]So for some reason, they had one timeline connect to this timeline.
[33:51.78]I don't know why you just want to make the song in one timeline.
[33:55.94]Alright, let's actually get a song here, though, a decent one.
[34:05.25]I'm going to make a little, OK, I'm going to make a house, like here.
[34:11.50]But not yet.
[34:12.98]I'm painting, goddammit.
[34:15.78]So let's do, let's just get a song.
[34:18.24]Something easy.
[34:21.20]Make a Minecraft house?
[34:22.72]The house I make is gonna be real bad.
[34:27.92]Wait, is this like Kingdom Hearts?
[34:39.09]delfino plaza these things people made these face my fears this is awesome animal crossing new leaf 1am I think that's pretty good I think that's what we're gonna have to loop here
[35:10.72]I actually don't think this will play when I'm editing.
[35:12.98]No, sorry, guys.
[35:13.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[35:38.23]As the congressional debate over gun control flares up yet again, we regret to report the murder of a wife and her two children by their husband and father.
[35:46.87]The father purchased the rifle used in the crime at his local gun store.
[35:55.87]No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[35:57.31]That's the PT thing.
[36:02.98]Why?
[36:08.62]Well, Seymour, I made it.
[36:10.20]Why are you doing this?
[36:11.78]Ah, Superintendent Chalmers, welcome.
[36:13.70]I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon.
[36:16.22]Oh, you gods!
[36:22.34]My roast is ruined!
[36:29.81]I want... Let's just... I want... I need snow.
[36:34.33]Oh, no, actually, you know what?
[36:36.57]Here, let's go...
[36:39.95]I'll go by tags, too.
[36:41.05]Like, they have this all sorted out here.
[36:44.87]Motion, ambience, ambience.
[36:46.45]Here we go.
[36:51.79]Lustery winter wind.
[37:00.00]Check this shit out.
[37:06.98]What is it?
[37:10.98]Oh, I can't make a field, can I?
[37:14.02]Because this is just in the background.
[37:19.97]I believe you can make a field where it only will play when you get in a certain distance.
[37:27.49]Because right now this is just going to play completely in front.
[37:32.72]Okay.
[37:40.70]Okay.
[37:41.54]It's very relaxing.
[37:42.28]It's very nice, but we're not done.
[37:46.50]Turn up my voice.
[37:47.34]I'm just going to turn this shit down.
[37:52.57]Shit.
[37:53.67]Okay.
[37:54.51]So we... This needs to be a little more detailed.
[37:59.11]I don't like it.
[37:59.81]I hate it.
[38:00.91]I'm going to delete the whole thing.
[38:02.03]Just kidding.
[38:04.04]Okay sculpt paint no let's do some painting let's get some more like dirt and shit on here You know what I mean like there's got to be so like let's get some good Fleck And I want like a 3d effect here Let's put the kaleidoscope on Maybe like make a fucking single goddamn flower right here.
[38:31.93]Oh
[38:33.35]No, no, no, no, no.
[38:34.19]Go back to sculpting.
[38:34.93]It's my ADHD.
[38:37.31]This is why I can't play these games.
[38:42.49]This needs to be the same color, though.
[38:49.18]And I need to blend them together.
[38:50.88]There's a way to do that, and I did the tutorial, and you blend shit.
[38:59.39]You can blend it.
[39:00.41]But how?
[39:01.43]I forget...
[39:09.08]Not looseness, not crop.
[39:10.78]There's a way that you can make two things blend in together.
[39:14.89]And can move them around and they stick together.
[39:16.99]And it looks really, really, really cool.
[39:26.53]I think it's like the stamp shape.
[39:30.80]I think it's like you go into the... Hold on.
[39:33.28]Let me just check this out for a second here.
[39:39.50]Is this it here?
[39:43.48]Like properties, effects, no.
[39:47.72]Boil?
[39:48.28]It's not boil.
[39:50.60]Physical properties.
[39:52.40]Movable.
[39:54.38]Friction.
[39:55.24]Fuck, I forget what it was.
[40:05.20]Damn it.
[40:05.70]I might have to go do that tutorial again.
[40:12.01]Because I know there's a way that you can make it.
[40:13.51]It looks really, really awesome.
[40:24.95]Ah, ha, ha, ha.
[40:25.55]This is it.
[40:25.87]This is it.
[40:26.21]This is it.
[40:29.37]Varying looseness.
[40:30.33]Yeah.
[40:30.67]Okay.
[40:31.37]This is it.
[40:32.29]Alright.
[40:32.75]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[40:34.01]I think it has to be on a certain... It has to be on stamp, too, as well.
[40:43.77]You can put a hole in it.
[40:45.27]Yeah, okay, okay.
[40:45.99]I have to do stamp.
[40:52.50]This is pretty good rock formation, though.
[40:54.04]Okay, I'm going to keep this rock formation.
[40:55.30]I'm going to clean it up a little.
[41:12.89]I'm going to carve this up a little.
[41:21.16]It's just gum.
[41:25.36]Yeah.
[41:32.85]No, that's a pretty decent rock formation, OK?
[41:36.91]Just wait.
[41:50.91]Oops.
[42:08.40]I'm gonna carve it up, don't worry.
[42:36.07]Pretty nice rock formation, I would say.
[42:37.55]I gotta just color it the right color.
[42:42.35]Okay.
[42:48.62]So, let's deselect.
[42:51.40]Yeah, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[42:53.84]That's pretty good.
[42:54.64]Just give me a second.
[43:02.22]I'm gonna put... Oh!
[43:35.94]No, you bet your ass this is how it's gonna go.
[43:37.78]There's gonna be a fucking, like, a little village right here.
[43:49.26]And then there you go, there's your shot.
[43:50.94]No, no, no, it's gonna be over here.
[43:52.41]I'll fix that later.
[43:53.21]Here's your shot right here.
[44:10.68]Can be like a little fucking farm or something right here.
[44:19.39]Can we think we can make a little to scale house over there?
[44:29.94]Alright, first of all, I need to make these the right color.
[44:37.81]Don't you guys know when you scale out of any image, it don't matter?
[44:41.67]This is the money right here.
[44:44.27]Right there.
[44:58.40]I'm going to shave it.
[44:59.60]Don't worry.
[45:00.02]I'll shave it.
[45:00.44]Just wait.
[45:00.82]Just watch.
[45:14.95]Okay, let's get the shave.
[45:17.67]Let's shave it out.
[45:19.39]I'm going to group these two together because this is where we're going to shave.
[45:24.44]I have to group these, you know, just in case.
[45:29.74]Group them up.
[45:31.20]Let's get in here.
[45:34.53]And let's get sculpting.
[45:36.37]What do you say?
[45:36.95]Okay, let's shave this up.
[45:40.95]It needs rounded for this one.
[45:46.34]That's way too much.
[45:50.48]No, I need like the filled donut.
[45:51.82]There we go.
[45:52.48]Okay.
[46:05.30]It's like carving clay with a knife.
[46:11.17]Look at Link, Link, Link, Link.
[46:12.73]What do you mean?
[46:17.30]What?
[46:17.50]What?
[46:36.74]Here, I'm gonna put this on the screen.
[46:39.08]I'm gonna put this on the screen for a while, too.
[46:40.74]This is too good.
[46:48.87]That should be a new emote.
[46:50.57]Yeah.
[46:51.75]Yeah, it will be.
[46:52.41]That's a new emote.
[46:53.13]I'm gonna literally do that today.
[46:55.03]That will be an emote you can use tomorrow.
[47:03.05]Just like that face.
[47:10.42]Oh my god, I'll let that sit there for a little while Alright, it's too harsh
[47:42.31]I can change it in the options later.
[47:55.58]Don't worry.
[47:55.84]With the Fleck tool, don't worry.
[47:57.68]It looks too carved.
[47:58.58]It looks too perfect.
[47:59.30]I'll fuck it all up.
[48:00.14]I'll make it look better.
[48:00.78]I'm only going to use it from this side anyways.
[48:10.66]okay go down a little okay let's give me a different give me like the wedge
[48:37.57]I mean, it's still going to look kind of natural, right?
[48:39.21]So that looks a little bit... When I do some more messing around with the flat, it'll look a little bit natural.
[48:45.88]Actually, no, no, no, no, no.
[48:46.84]I want that to be flat.
[48:50.80]Because I want to put, like, a little house here.
[49:00.77]That'll be okay.
[49:01.43]I'll mess with it with the flat tool.
[49:05.91]Okay, let's see.
[49:06.61]If I was to be, like, up here.
[49:12.27]Let's go back.
[49:18.82]This is a pretty decent start.
[49:26.08]Okay.
[49:29.16]I need to change this, though.
[49:30.30]We need to mess with this.
[49:32.70]I need to go into paint tool.
[49:36.66]And I want to make... I need to make like a cactus or something.
[49:40.56]I don't know.
[49:43.69]We'll go with... Like this.
[49:47.57]Come here.
[49:49.21]I got to get the snap off.
[49:50.59]Take the snapping to surfaces off.
[49:51.73]Because I'm just going to make something to use in the scene.
[49:54.27]Alright.
[49:54.59]I'm going to make a... I don't know.
[49:56.44]Throw me something.
[49:56.88]Give me an idea.
[49:57.46]A rock?
[49:58.54]Alright.
[49:58.84]Good.
[49:59.18]I'll do a rock.
[50:02.15]No, I already have a bunch of rocks.
[50:03.37]Like, I'm gonna make a cactus?
[50:06.07]A pine tree.
[50:07.09]Alright, I'll do a pine tree.
[50:08.05]But why would a pine tree be out here?
[50:13.23]Alright, pine tree.
[50:14.31]I don't know what a pine tree looks like.
[50:15.39]I'll try.
[50:16.72]Okay, pine tree.
[50:19.44]Let's go.
[50:19.88]We need, like, a straight line here.
[50:21.36]We need, like, a... straight... or... No...
[50:34.90]Okay, draw a fleck.
[50:38.88]What the fuck does a pine tree look like?
[50:40.35]I know it's gonna get brown.
[50:44.89]It's like a brown base, right?
[50:51.11]That doesn't look brown.
[50:57.27]Oh, I still have the hexagon tool on.
[51:00.75]Kaleidoscope is still on.
[51:02.14]Okay.
[51:06.40]And they are pretty waxy.
[51:08.64]That's fine.
[51:09.30]We'll go with this.
[51:15.73]Why is it like... No, it's because the lighting is weird.
[51:21.11]I'm going to have to do it like this.
[51:29.17]No, I don't like that tool.
[51:30.11]I don't like this one.
[51:30.81]It's definitely not this one.
[51:33.65]Veins?
[51:40.09]We can make a tree out of this.
[51:41.73]Just gonna make it smaller.
[51:42.85]Okay, hold on.
[51:47.13]Expressive Impressionist.
[51:50.31]Hmm...
[52:10.39]No, I don't want it to be scattered around everywhere.
[52:17.25]Change the bootleg elevator music?
[52:19.27]What are you talking about?
[52:20.87]I feel like I should just do it like this.
[52:26.69]Just, like, paint it up and then add... No, that's too... that's ugly.
[52:32.74]Go back to the paint tool.
[52:35.12]Alright, close, please.
[52:40.38]I just got, I'm so, ah, there's so many options, so many things to do.
[52:48.12]Hide everything else.
[52:49.25]Um, I know there are other things to do, which is lost in the tutorials in my brain.
[52:57.35]I know, okay, let's do kaleidoscope.
[52:59.38]I'll do three.
[53:01.80]And then...
[53:05.89]just try this with the color just go brown and I'm gonna make it so it's the draw so see that's as big as it's gonna get okay so let's just try to make a trunk
[53:50.27]Looks alright.
[54:00.88]Looks like a giant Jenga tower, but that's okay.
[54:03.26]Because then it sprays out a little.
[54:12.17]No, maybe not all the way.
[54:13.37]I think that's alright.
[54:38.42]Oh, it's a palm tree.
[54:41.91]No, I need to have roots down here.
[54:45.07]They gotta be good roots.
[54:46.13]No, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[54:50.66]We're going to do just kind of random color in the bottom there and different fleck.
[54:56.27]Cubist?
[55:07.60]I like it.
[55:07.96]I like it.
[55:21.61]Let's just see.
[55:22.27]Don't just wait.
[55:22.86]Let's just see.
[56:16.04]What?
[56:17.82]It's expressionist.
[56:31.47]Oh, it's too quiet.
[56:32.35]Sorry.
[56:33.51]What does it express?
[56:34.43]I don't know.
[56:34.71]It's just like a broad paint stroke.
[56:36.17]Alright.
[56:36.83]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[56:38.41]Wait, wait, wait.
[56:38.97]Leave me alone.
[56:39.53]Leave me alone.
[56:41.43]Okay.
[56:41.93]This is done.
[56:44.35]We're going to start a new painting.
[56:46.88]Wait, is it there?
[56:48.04]Okay.
[56:49.32]Okay, now, we're gonna do the top.
[56:52.58]This is where we get to be really, really, really fun.
[56:55.62]Okay, we're gonna go with veins.
[56:58.80]Check this out.
[56:59.41]Ready?
[56:59.65]Get rid of the hexagon.
[57:00.57]And then let's turn this like this.
[57:05.25]Let's just see what that looks like, painting it.
[57:29.50]Don't let anybody tell you that you're doing it wrong I think it could work
[57:56.49]No, they're not fucking pubes.
[57:59.55]No!
[58:00.63]Alright, hold on.
[58:03.13]Let me just see what they look like.
[58:04.53]Edit Fleck.
[58:05.07]I like the scatter.
[58:10.97]Bring the opacity down a little.
[58:12.37]You can make like an expression, just bird.
[58:15.12]You can do whatever you want.
[58:17.02]These need to be smaller.
[58:17.90]And they also need to be green.
[58:23.50]Pine tree is, like, super ugly.
[58:25.38]Well, I'll do the whole spectrum here.
[58:26.80]Okay.
[58:27.74]Here we go.
[58:30.80]So, it just needs to be... Let's go spin it this way.
[58:37.45]So we go down.
[58:39.19]And we're gonna put flow on this, too.
[58:41.11]What's flow, Jeremy?
[58:41.97]You'll see.
[58:42.49]Just wait.
[58:45.58]Oh, I hate this.
[58:53.93]I want to, like, move it this way, but it's like flying three airplanes at the same time for some reason.
[58:58.47]Alright, just tilt this way.
[59:00.43]Why is it so difficult to have you go over here?
[59:06.16]Oh my god.
[59:10.68]You're killing me.
[59:17.99]Okay, that's what I wanted.
[59:20.79]I'll put new music on in a second.
[59:23.53]So we're talking about pine tree.
[59:25.49]So pine tree, very sticky and prickly, right?
[59:30.75]Who gives a fuck it's a pine tree? ...
[60:13.83]Spread that a little more.
[60:21.39]Hide everything so I can get a good view.
[60:26.01]This comes out.
[60:33.15]It doesn't look bad.
[60:35.64]It's gonna be a little longer.
[60:58.40]I think that's good.
[61:05.36]to check the sides it did look yeah it's a little flat you have to make it a little bit bigger over here it's a little flat but it's okay because I'm just going to come down here and we'll make it down this way probably should have turned on like the mirror tool or something
[61:49.20]Every tree needs another tree.
[61:50.39]Oh, yeah, I know.
[61:52.49]The best thing about this game is you only have to do this once.
[61:57.49]You only have to do this once.
[61:59.99]Oops.
[62:00.49]Yeah, I kind of screwed that up.
[62:04.20]There we go.
[62:07.48]Get in here.
[62:08.80]I look like down.
[62:09.52]There we go.
[62:12.00]That's better.
[62:16.24]Oh, come on.
[62:18.63]This game's gonna have VR later?
[62:19.97]That'd be awesome.
[62:24.63]Is snapping on?
[62:25.41]I don't think snapping's on.
[62:33.77]Doesn't need to be perfect.
[62:35.43]Just needs to get the idea across.
[62:37.03]It's gonna be scaled anyways.
[62:47.75]we're gonna put some flow on this too so don't worry we'll be good alright and not I don't know if that's really a pine tree it's more like a bush but that's alright
[63:16.68]Okay, so now we put this over here.
[63:21.12]Oh, something's wrong there.
[63:22.10]That's all fucked up.
[63:26.74]I'll fix it.
[63:29.96]Yeah, that's all fucked up.
[63:31.86]That's all fucked up.
[63:33.30]Ah, that's all fucked up.
[63:34.18]Looks like the erase tool.
[63:39.63]Ah, shit's all fucked up.
[63:42.91]How do I erase it?
[63:45.55]I don't even know if there is an erase tool in the game.
[63:50.78]I really don't think there is.
[63:58.15]Well, I'll figure it out in a second.
[64:12.65]Spiderman?
[64:14.43]How long before you guys get rid of that one?
[64:51.03]Is this the whole song?
[64:52.99]Okay, fine.
[64:53.55]We'll do this one.
[64:57.76]Which one of these is Animal Crossing?
[64:59.62]There it is.
[65:26.60]There you go.
[65:28.14]You got a friend?
[65:29.46]Alright.
[65:29.94]You got a friend in me.
[65:33.10]You got a friend in me.
[65:53.02]I don't know, I have no idea how this song goes.
[65:57.54]How do I erase this?
[66:24.75]I know you can.
[66:26.13]Here we go.
[66:26.55]Delete.
[66:27.91]Delete.
[66:29.71]Ah, there is an erase tool.
[66:55.20]There we go.
[66:55.62]I'll clean it up a little.
[66:58.30]Alright.
[67:02.64]Let's connect these two together.
[67:16.26]Kind of sad, but it's alright.
[67:18.53]I'm not done.
[67:20.29]No, I forgot to do the fucking cool shit.
[67:21.87]Hold on.
[67:24.49]The trunk is too long.
[67:28.89]No, it's not, is it?
[67:29.63]I don't even know what a pine tree looks like.
[67:34.29]I think I have to shave off some of this.
[67:52.17]It's too much.
[67:58.91]This is like a willow tree.
[68:00.13]Yeah, alright, let's go shave some stuff off here.
[68:02.33]A little too long.
[68:21.87]Take out some of the bulk from the back.
[68:30.82]Alright, that's a little better.
[68:32.28]And I'm going to move... I'm going to fuck with this a little bit too.
[68:36.71]Oh, Jeremy, don't fuck with it.
[68:37.73]I'm going to fuck with it.
[68:41.91]What's flow?
[68:42.71]I'll show you.
[68:45.11]So, here is where we get to have a little bit of fun.
[68:50.01]I'll connect these two together in a second.
[68:51.21]But, let's go to style mode.
[68:54.21]Alright, this is what we... Hold on.
[69:11.72]Bring it back a little, what do you think?
[69:27.87]No.
[69:29.41]No, no.
[69:30.07]It's turning into that guy's hair from the meme.
[69:33.19]What is that meme?
[69:36.62]That's not bad.
[69:39.40]I don't hate this.
[69:54.21]That looks pretty good.
[69:59.64]And then check this shit out.
[70:02.38]The finishing touches we're gonna put on this, you wouldn't even believe it.
[70:18.17]Maybe a little too much.
[70:26.06]Look at that.
[70:27.81]It's alive.
[70:31.97]That's all you need.
[70:32.75]That's it.
[70:33.45]Don't need anything else.
[70:40.67]And, okay, back it up.
[70:44.58]Now we're going to go to style.
[70:46.98]No, no, no, no, no, no, we're not.
[70:48.36]We're going to go to coat mode.
[70:52.72]Finish.
[70:55.51]And we're going to get some shine, more shine on these leaves.
[71:07.24]Look at that, glistening.
[71:09.16]More.
[71:10.92]More?
[71:13.62]No, less.
[71:19.48]I'll go back.
[71:24.40]paint we can add some we can add like a couple of little things here tint hue glow okay maybe this is what I want for glow where's the glow okay color I want it to be like baking in the sun
[71:52.61]A little burnt.
[71:53.13]No, no, no, no, no.
[71:54.13]I'm not even glowing.
[71:55.45]I'm not even doing glow.
[71:59.53]Go back.
[72:02.31]Apply glow.
[72:03.31]There it is.
[72:07.13]Oh, too much.
[72:08.62]Too much.
[72:09.12]Back it up.
[72:09.58]Back it up.
[72:14.54]That looks good.
[72:16.94]Now we're going to do the trunk.
[72:22.64]You didn't think I was going to make a good tree, did you?
[72:26.40]You didn't think I was going to make a decent tree.
[72:28.32]And the roots are there for a very specific reason.
[72:30.32]Watch.
[72:30.64]I'm not done.
[72:37.38]This one, no.
[72:43.33]We're going to change this a little bit.
[72:46.51]I want to... Let's go into the tool menu here.
[72:50.69]Mmm.
[72:51.89]It's actually terrible.
[72:52.93]Alright, I'm turning on the ice cream cone.
[73:00.36]Mmm.
[73:03.88]Hold on a second.
[73:05.28]Hold on a second.
[73:06.00]Hold on.
[73:06.36]Hold on.
[73:34.00]No.
[73:34.76]This was checking... I just wanted to know.
[73:36.06]Just was curious to see what it looked like.
[73:38.30]We're going to make this a little smoother.
[73:39.50]We're going to ruffle the fleck up a little bit.
[73:44.58]So let's go ahead and do that now.
[73:49.40]Alright, I want... Color's fine.
[73:52.04]The finish is fine.
[73:52.90]Tint is fine.
[73:53.60]Actually, I want it to be a little lighter.
[73:58.34]Let's go to... from here to here.
[74:00.48]Let's see if we can make this a little lighter.
[74:06.48]There we go.
[74:08.28]That's more like a wood look.
[74:11.90]Don't you just want to take these little wood chips and just chew them up?
[74:14.37]I do.
[74:14.61]Okay, back it up.
[74:18.45]Into... We don't need any effects on this one.
[74:20.61]We just need... Loosen it up a little.
[74:29.16]No.
[74:31.00]Actually, tighten it up.
[74:40.59]Mmm... Yeah, it's already tight enough already.
[74:56.84]I don't hate that.
[75:05.38]I don't hate that.
[75:09.06]Yeah, it's a little crooked, but it's okay.
[75:22.11]There we go.
[75:25.52]Now it's wood.
[75:27.06]It's square like wood.
[75:28.40]Now let's... Hold on.
[75:33.08]I'll fix it.
[75:34.25]I'll make it straight.
[75:46.09]Too big.
[75:52.91]Top needs to be shaved a little.
[75:58.63]Alright, now... This is what we're gonna do here.
[76:04.11]Oops.
[76:06.69]That needs to be way smaller.
[76:11.57]I just combed all the flecks, like, down.
[76:13.59]Never mind.
[76:15.78]Nope.
[76:17.04]Now it's just turning into sheet metal.
[76:30.49]No.
[76:30.89]Tight flecks are fine.
[76:31.81]It looks more like a trunk.
[76:39.95]Okay.
[76:41.35]Let's stick this over here and combine them.
[76:46.69]I think we're good on tint.
[76:48.15]We don't need any effects on here.
[76:51.17]Unless I want to add... Alright, let me straighten it.
[77:01.04]Oh, fuck.
[77:01.52]I don't think this ever can be straight.
[77:06.60]Is this like an optical illusion?
[77:07.72]How do I make this straight?
[77:17.41]Oh, come on.
[77:19.47]What?
[77:28.77]What?
[77:29.35]This is an optical illusion!
[77:39.87]It don't matter.
[77:40.55]Alright, we're gonna just combine it.
[77:44.93]Make sure it's in the right spot.
[77:53.17]I almost think the bottom should be prayed out a little more.
[77:55.53]Don't you think?
[78:31.44]There we go.
[78:32.54]Lower?
[78:32.88]Higher?
[78:33.30]That looks alright.
[78:34.34]Maybe a little bit higher?
[78:35.00]I think that's it.
[78:35.68]I think we got it.
[78:36.66]Perfect.
[78:37.69]Done.
[79:04.03]Why are you spending two hours making a tree?
[79:07.83]Why not?
[79:12.93]Why not?
[79:13.55]It's fun.
[79:16.99]I think you're describing this whole game.
[79:19.33]That's the whole game.
[79:20.15]Alright, that's it.
[79:24.69]Here's the tree.
[79:27.89]So that two hours... I haven't even lived for two hours.
[79:31.10]What are you talking about?
[79:33.33]Alright, so that's... Where's that going to go?
[79:37.03]Here's the beauty of this.
[79:56.28]And I can go in and change these too.
[80:00.40]They're all identical.
[80:01.58]Don't you worry about that.
[80:02.62]You don't think I...
[80:06.69]You don't think I thought about that?
[80:12.05]Don't worry.
[80:16.37]I can... Because these are all grouped, I can go in and... Come on, Shredding.
[80:21.99]Just change this one.
[80:23.57]So let's select this one.
[80:25.45]Let's go into it.
[80:27.55]And then see how I have both of these.
[80:29.19]Now, go ahead and pull up that menu we had before.
[80:32.81]The style menu.
[80:35.97]Loosen it up.
[80:39.01]Ruffle some feathers a little bit.
[80:45.79]Can even add some to it.
[80:48.84]And that's done.
[80:50.32]Different.
[80:50.74]Now I can copy this one if I really so desire.
[81:03.86]Oops.
[81:17.98]I can't tell the difference.
[81:19.00]Well, look, if I really wanted to spend time, I could do this.
[81:22.94]You really want me to do this again?
[81:24.14]Because this is how I do it.
[81:27.14]Look.
[81:28.90]I make another Luch.
[81:31.14]You want me to do it again?
[81:31.94]Because I already have an object there now that's ready to go.
[81:35.98]And I could make like two or three more tree leaves.
[81:41.50]I'm going to make... No, no, no.
[82:03.19]Look, this is just for the, like, oops.
[82:09.51]I don't even want those there.
[82:15.85]Okay, get rid of these two, because these two are different.
[82:21.63]And they flow, too.
[82:23.21]First of all, we're going to change this to stone.
[82:25.41]It's freaking me out.
[82:31.62]Oops, that was the ambient sound.
[82:33.12]I thought that was fucking, you got a friend in me.
[82:38.42]You got a friend in me.
[82:41.07]Alright.
[82:42.09]Now I'm gonna... RIP fleshy ground.
[82:46.03]No, we can't just have the ground be looking like that this whole time.
[82:53.87]I need... I need to animate...
[83:00.19]Okay, let's get to the beginning.
[83:01.77]Okay, let's see how that looks.
[83:19.34]Looks good.
[83:31.37]I'm gonna make Q-Bert.
[83:33.09]Oh, I wanna make Q-Bert now.
[83:34.27]I wanna make a Q-Bert level.
[83:35.85]No, no, no.
[83:36.35]Focus first.
[83:37.07]Focus, focus, focus, focus, focus.
[83:45.18]So this is what it looks like alive.
[83:47.10]Living scene.
[83:48.76]And I'm gonna, like, make this look fucking sick.
[83:51.30]I can't wait.
[83:51.88]Alright.
[83:54.32]Let's change this.
[83:55.56]Because this is... I'm gonna put something here.
[83:59.90]Do Q-Bert or Riot.
[84:00.92]We'll make Q-Bert at the end.
[84:02.14]You can just hang out on top of the mountain.
[84:03.36]I could redo that smoking shit up there, too.
[84:08.78]Alright, so this... And I'm going to make it a level.
[84:11.42]It's going to be a platform level to get to the top of the mountain.
[84:13.34]I'm biting off way more than I can chew, okay?
[84:19.82]I need...
[84:21.99]no no no I need to go to the coat tint and we need to make this not the skin like flesh color what color do I want um maybe they could be like a little blue like kind of like this it's supposed to be snowy
[84:51.14]It could be cold and snowy and shit.
[85:03.13]Let's try this one.
[85:11.62]What?
[85:26.86]I suck ice.
[85:27.90]Alright, hold on.
[85:30.23]Let's bring it back a little.
[85:31.63]I need to... This needs to be flatter.
[85:38.51]That's good.
[85:40.88]You know what?
[85:41.28]Fuck it.
[85:41.60]Let's...
[85:58.13]Now that makes more sense.
[85:59.21]Alright, now, let me go back into style mode and let's change this, make it look a little better.
[86:05.71]This looks like shit.
[86:14.48]Oh, that looks way worse.
[86:49.73]Hmm.
[86:53.87]No, it's gonna be flat.
[86:59.84]Let's flatten this out.
[87:01.40]And I think I'm gonna apply some fleck here.
[87:10.81]Yeah.
[87:11.27]We're gonna apply a little fleck.
[87:13.23]And it's gonna be the square.
[87:14.31]Let's see.
[87:25.38]Is that doing anything?
[87:26.00]I don't think it's doing anything.
[87:32.91]I feel like I should just... How did I fuck that up in the first place?
[87:39.03]This, you know what I mean?
[87:41.11]Why is it like that?
[87:41.85]I think I have to... Yeah, it was in here.
[87:46.32]Right?
[87:46.62]Yeah, looseness.
[87:51.60]Looseness and varying looseness.
[87:58.34]It's kind of irredeemable at the moment, though.
[88:05.51]Wait, what are you doing?
[88:07.89]What?
[88:08.73]Hey.
[88:11.91]Hey.
[88:12.13]I don't want to put a circle here.
[88:14.93]What are you doing?
[88:19.05]I want to edit this.
[88:24.36]Wait a second.
[88:25.68]Here we go.
[88:39.35]I'm confused.
[88:40.13]Why is it not?
[88:49.71]Shouldn't I be able just to edit this one?
[88:50.97]Because that's what it looks like I'm doing.
[88:57.75]Is there a reason why I can't change that back?
[89:00.32]Or am I changing it back?
[89:05.05]Is it happening and I just don't... I'm just dumb?
[89:08.31]No, see, it's happening to that one.
[89:09.45]See what I'm saying?
[89:11.71]Shouldn't that be doing the smoothness on this one, too?
[89:13.53]Oh, it's because I need to be on the stamp tool.
[89:19.50]Right, right, right.
[89:20.20]Okay.
[89:21.70]I will forget that a bunch of times.
[89:23.00]Don't worry.
[89:31.81]Stamp.
[89:32.35]There it is.
[89:33.15]Okay.
[89:33.31]Okay.
[89:34.98]Now I can go in and make this smoother.
[89:39.06]Technically, right?
[89:39.92]Should I?
[89:42.94]Wait.
[89:48.20]Why is this not working?
[90:02.03]I don't understand why I can't change the properties here.
[90:11.78]I have no idea why.
[90:12.62]I have absolutely no clue.
[90:18.14]Because it's making me change this one.
[90:20.84]Aww.
[90:41.74]Just put it inside the other shape and just combine them.
[90:45.62]I guess I could do that.
[90:46.70]I feel like there's an easier way to do it, though.
[90:48.92]Okay, and now... Edit shape.
[91:01.79]No, it's... Maybe it is affecting it.
[91:07.69]No, it's not.
[91:12.08]Well, unfortunately, I have no idea.
[91:13.88]I have no clue.
[91:16.64]And I'm gonna have to go back and, like, watch tutorials again, because I don't have a single fucking clue.
[91:26.25]I changed it before, and now I can't change it back.
[91:30.41]For some reason.
[91:34.67]Mmm, oh well.
[91:37.91]Am I scoped in?
[91:38.85]Oh, yeah.
[91:39.79]I am now.
[91:42.47]Like I was.
[91:43.23]Here, I'm scoped in again.
[91:44.15]Is it because they grouped?
[91:46.55]Let's see.
[91:48.67]Let me just edit the object outside of sculpt mode.
[91:58.04]Hold on.
[91:59.80]Edit sculpture.
[92:00.66]Will this work now?
[92:09.12]I don't think so.
[92:12.65]It looks like it's doing something, but maybe I just fucked it up too much that it can't do it anymore.
[92:20.78]I guess it is doing it.
[92:26.45]Yeah, it is.
[92:29.25]I think I just screwed with it too much.
[92:32.59]Oh well.
[92:35.57]It's editing the tool that I'm using.
[92:37.23]Yeah, but is there no way for me to revert this back to the way that it was before?
[92:43.33]It's alright.
[92:48.16]Let's keep going.
[92:48.66]Alright, what's next?
[92:56.12]L1 plus square.
[92:57.18]Invisible, movable...
[93:03.29]Collision labels.
[93:04.89]Audio.
[93:07.67]Maybe, hold on.
[93:08.79]Scope in and then L1 square.
[93:11.21]Alright, hold on a second here.
[93:13.25]Tint amount.
[93:15.51]Shine.
[93:15.89]Alright, hold on.
[93:16.40]This is the actual menu menu of this thing.
[93:20.10]Waxiness, metalness.
[93:21.80]Okay.
[93:25.40]Roughness.
[93:28.36]That looks kind of cool.
[93:31.03]Hue Cycle.
[93:31.85]I feel like I don't want to screw with this.
[93:38.55]This is the Fleck Properties.
[93:39.95]I don't think this is going to work.
[93:46.21]Looseness.
[93:47.15]Fleck Perspective.
[93:48.11]Whoa!
[93:55.62]Yeah, I have big flecks that I can't really shrink.
[94:03.76]Effects?
[94:04.12]No.
[94:07.59]Friction?
[94:09.13]No.
[94:12.45]I feel like I may have gone too far on it.
[94:16.33]It's possible.
[94:21.21]I can change the... I'll make it a little different.
[94:25.50]Waxiness?
[94:26.50]Yeah, it's all good.
[94:29.38]It's all good.
[94:32.24]It looks alright.
[94:32.74]It looks fine.
[94:34.54]It just looks like it's made out of puff pastry.
[94:38.58]Or paper mache.
[94:39.66]But that's fine.
[94:42.37]I'm just playing around.
[94:46.61]Alright.
[94:49.23]What's next?
[94:50.11]This next part is... I kind of want to fix this.
[94:56.96]And I want to change that, too.
[95:00.54]webcam demands.
[95:01.52]I'm just... Honestly, I'm just trying to focus.
[95:05.27]So, I haven't really been looking at chat that much because I've been trying to focus on making trees.
[95:11.95]And that's a pretty damn good tree.
[95:15.81]But, no, I'm not going to put on a webcam.
[95:17.37]Why would I put a webcam on?
[95:22.32]No, you want to see the beauty of the mountains, not me.
[95:24.74]Alright, let's go into...
[95:32.85]Now, unfortunately, I said I wanted this to be a sculpture.
[95:36.81]So I didn't say I wanted this to be a video game.
[95:39.91]Does anybody know if does that matter?
[95:41.93]Or can I make this a platformer?
[95:45.21]Starting like over here and make it over here.
[95:50.67]No, it doesn't matter.
[95:51.33]Okay.
[95:53.30]Well, let's do what I was going to do in the first place.
[95:54.80]And let's just put these trees in different places.
[96:12.56]Yes, they all look the same, but you know what?
[96:16.67]I don't got time.
[96:17.43]I don't got time to care about that.
[96:38.46]Because once you do this, it almost doesn't matter.
[96:41.82]But I did this.
[96:45.78]Nope!
[96:50.40]Nice grass.
[96:51.36]Yeah, I should probably put grass here first.
[96:55.13]And this isn't even big enough to have that tree here.
[96:59.41]Now it should be fine.
[97:00.53]Let's go like this.
[97:09.98]That should do it.
[97:18.22]Now what does that look like?
[97:19.08]That looks better!
[97:28.59]This looks stupid.
[97:32.53]That doesn't look like it belongs anywhere over here.
[97:37.51]Let's just go like that.
[97:43.69]And this needs to be changed to get in here.
[97:57.97]Because that's just sort of sticking out.
[98:00.02]It looks bad.
[98:05.28]Make it bigger.
[98:13.08]Eh.
[98:15.01]Eh.
[98:15.63]Oh well.
[98:16.67]I can only add a couple later anyways.
[98:23.09]Let's get some grass here.
[98:24.79]In fact, the paint tool.
[98:29.78]And I would say, what looks the most like grass?
[98:35.96]Mm.
[98:39.01]That's not terrible.
[98:48.87]You know you don't own a single thing in the game.
[98:51.33]What do you mean?
[98:57.22]That's grassy.
[99:00.04]That's good and grassy.
[99:04.30]Oh, yeah.
[99:05.02]Okay, let's get some grass.
[99:07.00]What do you mean?
[99:07.54]You don't own it?
[99:08.16]Oh, is it one of those scenarios where a media molecule owns the rights?
[99:14.12]Well, I don't know.
[99:14.80]I guess you have to sign that EULA, right?
[99:17.93]Or whatever it is.
[99:30.03]This is grass.
[99:37.21]I'm going to do a fun thing called copy this 5,000 times.
[99:39.38]They're going to start producing the popsicle.
[99:51.95]I just make somebody eating a popsicle next.
[99:55.61]God damn it.
[99:56.87]Ah!
[99:58.97]Why?
[100:06.06]Well, whatever.
[100:08.34]Just going to do it like this anyways.
[100:17.22]I'm just going to paint it on there.
[100:18.84]Why make an object?
[100:20.30]There's no reason to even do that.
[100:21.36]I'm just going to paint it to the surface and call it a day.
[100:29.21]Brush is fine.
[100:31.07]Surface snap.
[100:34.56]Yeah, fuck it.
[100:35.24]Let's just paint it on here.
[100:41.32]Give me the green.
[100:44.88]And it was, which one was it?
[100:45.76]This one, right?
[100:49.31]Straight up, maybe?
[100:51.63]Yeah, that's fine.
[100:52.37]Whatever, that's fine.
[100:53.47]Doesn't matter.
[101:02.83]Once we get it painted in here, we can mess with the fleck and it'll look like grass.
[101:15.56]Chat's bored.
[101:16.60]Well, I did tell you what I was going to be doing today.
[101:19.54]I did make it very clear that I was going to just be playing Dreams and sculpting random stuff and learning.
[101:25.28]I did say that.
[101:29.86]You promised Sam and Max.
[101:31.99]on Friday.
[101:34.01]Today's not Friday.
[101:37.12]Check your calendar.
[101:49.58]Do the whole stream like that?
[101:51.30]No.
[101:57.39]You said you were playing other people's maps?
[101:58.91]Well, here's the thing.
[102:00.05]Nobody made any.
[102:03.47]so that happened there are no maps with the title Jerma unless somebody made one and I don't know about it I've said for the last like week that I was going to be playing dreams today and that's what we're doing
[102:34.45]Because I, like, want to learn how to play it.
[102:38.53]Look, I can't make anything unless I learn how to play.
[102:41.17]And I can't learn how to play unless I play.
[102:43.21]And I can't not stream it because I stream three or four days a week.
[102:48.15]So I have to play it.
[102:49.69]Otherwise, I'm never going to make anything.
[102:51.03]Alright, let's see how this looks.
[103:07.53]There's only, like, five new games since the first stream.
[103:12.90]Well, it is... Here's something I will say, right?
[103:18.16]This game asks a lot out of the player.
[103:24.66]It's very, very much a full video game engine.
[103:28.72]When you have, like, ten hours of tutorials, you're expecting somebody's gonna want to do it, right?
[103:41.40]And this game has been sort of in development for a very... It's been sitting in development for like, what, five, six years?
[103:53.89]Maybe they've been desperately trying to figure out how to make the game appealing to people without requiring them to play for like 150 hours to do anything.
[104:03.35]But you kind of have to do that.
[104:07.79]It's an amazing art tool and an amazing game and crafting tool.
[104:17.85]So, it might be a hard sell for most people though, because, I mean, that doesn't surprise me.
[104:23.90]Because the game asks, it does ask a lot.
[104:27.04]The game's tutorials take as long as, like, Resident Evil 2 did to beat the whole game.
[104:31.20]At least one of the, you know, sides.
[104:36.21]Alright, let me see how that looks.
[104:37.41]Wait, wait, wait.
[104:38.53]I don't want grass all the way over here.
[104:40.23]I'm going to do a little bit.
[104:41.07]I'm going to have it fade out.
[104:49.94]Alright, let's see what that looks like.
[104:58.58]Because now we go like this.
[105:04.76]Okay.
[105:07.62]Uh-oh.
[105:08.48]What's going on here?
[105:11.71]What did I fuck up here?
[105:16.71]I screwed something up here, and I don't know what.
[105:18.75]I just want to select this.
[105:24.65]And make it look like grass.
[105:26.36]Oh god.
[105:31.15]This game would be amazing on PC.
[105:33.55]Yeah, it's kind of baffling, actually, that they would spend this much time making such a cool experience that you have to control with, like, the motion controllers or the DualShock.
[105:43.92]If I had a mouse, this stuff would be going 500 times faster.
[105:51.11]And I think that's going to be a huge problem for a lot of people that want to get into this game is they'll just be like, well, why did I just go play with Unity instead?
[105:58.43]You know what I mean?
[106:00.28]It's like way too much for like a casual audience to do and way too little for somebody that has Unity.
[106:08.44]It's weird.
[106:14.27]Because I'm not sure what audience they're targeting with this game.
[106:22.01]But regardless, I need to find out why... Why is this happening?
[106:31.70]Oh, there we go.
[106:32.30]Volume brush.
[106:32.98]There it was.
[106:33.36]Alright, here we go.
[106:33.90]Okay, come down.
[106:42.26]People who want Unity but don't want or don't have a PC or something.
[106:45.38]Oh, maybe.
[106:59.07]I'm going to make this a little tinted a little bit.
[107:03.01]Put on music?
[107:03.69]I will.
[107:05.93]I will.
[107:06.23]Just a minute.
[107:16.46]I'm not sure what the fuck this thing is even for.
[107:20.02]It just kind of screws everything up.
[107:21.18]Alright.
[107:24.92]Let's do effects.
[107:30.94]And what do you do?
[107:32.02]Wave.
[107:38.28]That's a little too much.
[107:39.56]That's like water.
[107:42.63]Um, flow maybe?
[107:43.63]Mmm.
[107:53.38]But, yeah, to give you, like, I guess... I've put... We've streamed for, like, an hour and, like, 50 minutes or so.
[108:00.26]And the tutorials.
[108:00.96]I've put probably 15 hours in the game so far.
[108:04.00]20, if we count, right?
[108:06.00]Like, 15 to 20 if you count the first stream.
[108:14.37]Are you making a poison swamp?
[108:15.69]What is throb?
[108:17.15]Evaporate?
[108:19.33]Boil.
[108:21.51]I really think it just needs to be like wave, but just a tiny bit.
[108:25.39]Alright, that looks fine.
[108:33.11]But yeah, I do foresee a very, very difficult time when this releases.
[108:36.79]Because like I said, it's almost too complicated for anyone to play it casually, but not complicated enough for somebody that's serious about it.
[108:53.88]Let's change this.
[109:03.04]Is that type?
[109:03.98]It is.
[109:11.55]OK, let's see.
[109:15.27]Uh-huh.
[109:19.49]Oh, no, not again.
[109:20.25]What happened?
[109:29.18]Alright, let me.
[109:30.00]Alright, now let's take this back here.
[109:34.68]And I need this look bad.
[109:40.47]Alright, let's get it.
[109:42.43]Wait, I can move a tree now over here.
[109:45.61]We've got a good group of green hues.
[109:54.19]What's the end game mirror?
[109:55.13]I really don't have one.
[109:56.17]I'm just trying to make sure I know how to use the tools.
[110:02.52]And then I'm going to make the ice cream.
[110:05.00]Or something.
[110:05.68]I'm going to try to sculpt a face.
[110:08.66]But I'm just kind of dicking around.
[110:13.24]Let me add some more color here.
[110:20.88]Same thing.
[110:21.36]We'll do more of this.
[110:24.92]If I try the move controllers, I have not used the move controllers for one reason, because you need the camera.
[110:30.24]And I don't have the PS Move, PS4 camera anymore, because I gave the PS VR to a friend.
[110:37.78]So I don't have it anymore.
[110:38.76]So I have the move controllers, not the camera.
[110:44.95]But I gotta pee.
[110:46.23]I'll be right back.
[110:49.15]And then we'll make like a person.
[110:50.87]We'll make like a character.
[110:51.75]I'll be right back.
[112:46.53]Alright.
[112:48.89]I think I have an idea.
[112:49.75]I got an idea.
[112:59.96]Once I get the scene done, I'm going to make the giant that lives here.
[113:11.71]Oh, play something else now.
[113:15.42]How am I ever gonna learn?
[113:16.76]You know what I mean?
[113:19.64]Like, how am I ever gonna know how to do anything?
[113:24.44]That's been an hour.
[113:25.16]See you later.
[113:26.28]I'm gonna play a different game.
[113:27.52]I'll come back and do it again.
[113:29.00]When I... Impossible, by the way.
[113:37.01]Just learn Unity instead.
[113:38.59]Yeah, but, like...
[113:47.81]Imagine learning.
[113:49.05]I know.
[113:49.31]Imagine learning anything.
[113:53.67]No.
[113:54.27]No learning.
[113:55.49]Only results.
[113:57.53]No preparation.
[113:58.87]No learning.
[113:59.83]Only results.
[114:10.22]Imagine actually learning.
[114:11.58]Alright.
[114:13.46]What else do we have?
[114:14.04]Songs.
[114:26.46]I should make water down there, too.
[114:27.70]Yeah, I can't tell you this is going to be the most interesting stream, but I want to play it.
[114:39.91]I want to learn how to do some things.
[114:43.11]So at least, look, I was looking forward to this game for a long time, right?
[114:47.26]And we're also going to make it rain.
[114:49.02]Yeah, we're going to make it rain.
[114:57.46]So I'm gonna take my time and I'm gonna just try to make something interesting.
[115:00.60]Look, what you see here, it's the culmination.
[115:03.02]It's gonna be in like another hour or two.
[115:04.98]There's gonna be like a whole village over here.
[115:07.58]There's gonna be like something going on over here.
[115:09.08]I'm just gonna make like a big living sculpture.
[115:15.74]The only way you can learn is if you do it.
[115:19.09]That's the only way.
[115:20.11]And it's gonna take a little while and that's alright.
[115:27.06]I'm going to move this out of the way.
[115:32.78]You can also study to learn.
[115:34.22]When?
[115:36.00]When would you like me to do that?
[115:38.14]You want me to take two weeks off?
[115:40.46]You want me to not stream for two weeks and come back with two things that I made in Dreams?
[115:44.10]Is that what you want me to do?
[115:49.63]You sure?
[115:59.21]You were supposed to do that.
[116:00.23]I was supposed to take two weeks off of streaming to learn how to play Dreams?
[116:05.70]What are you talking about?
[116:17.05]What do you mean I did that?
[116:20.61]I said I wanted to do the tutorials, which are ten hours.
[116:31.23]And I already did it.
[116:31.95]You're talking about when I was with my mother.
[116:40.74]Hey, Ma.
[116:41.24]No, no, no.
[116:42.26]Sorry.
[116:43.34]I haven't seen you in like eight months.
[116:45.86]No, no, no.
[116:46.36]I'm not going to do anything with you.
[116:49.86]I'm playing Dreams.
[116:51.70]Every day.
[116:52.70]For like six to ten hours a day.
[116:55.97]No, just go home.
[116:56.33]I'm studying.
[116:59.41]I'm studying.
[117:17.36]No tutorial is going to give you creativity.
[117:19.16]Yeah, so what do you think I'm doing right now?
[117:21.70]Let's get a song.
[117:50.93]Is somebody ma- is this- I- Final Fantasy Overworld theme.
[118:06.61]Bubble tea.
[118:07.81]I feel like I want to make some music.
[118:09.09]I want to make a song too.
[118:10.79]After I'm done with this I want to make-
[118:26.27]I was just thinking about the playlist in the background.
[118:28.25]I thought my PlayStation just turned off.
[118:31.07]I was like, what the fuck just happened?
[118:38.80]Let's get the playlist.
[118:39.98]Actually, I can't even hear it because of the PlayStation 4.
[118:45.10]Put on the moon theme?
[118:46.36]Eh.
[118:49.24]I feel like that'll get old in a few minutes.
[118:57.81]Evil Morty.
[118:59.92]Wait, is this an entire playlist?
[119:08.32]Whoa, okay.
[119:14.04]City Folk?
[119:22.26]Not again!
[119:24.26]Oh, Nier Automata!
[119:26.44]Alien Manifestation?!
[119:27.50]Mmm... Eh... I feel like this is kind of... Soy milk.
[119:54.89]Added vocals.
[119:58.28]Okay.
[120:02.60]Let's see what you got.
[120:10.68]Added vocals!
[120:13.48]Oh, it's just instrument- there's no added vocals!
[120:16.00]Alright, let's go here.
[120:27.46]I'm gonna make the giant.
[120:55.20]Okay, let's get some eyes.
[120:57.02]This is fucking terrifying.
[121:52.35]devil in his head
[122:28.24]come on out here this is so scary it really is with this song in the background
[123:22.71]That's way too big of an ear Okay, it looks like somebody's punching through his head through his brain that's what it is
[124:22.38]I'm gonna... I can't... I don't think I can put blood everywhere, can I?
[124:25.97]It's gonna be way, way thinner.
[124:55.97]He's doing a thumbs up That's not a thumb
[125:27.86]It's not a thumb.
[125:28.60]I gotta get it right on.
[125:29.78]Look at this.
[125:31.47]Look at that, like, cooked, cut up cauliflower.
[125:36.04]I can do it.
[125:36.48]Hold on.
[125:57.19]Dude, I can't.
[126:03.63]No, I like it like that.
[126:05.50]That's your thumb.
[126:06.42]Your thumb bends all the way backwards like a fucking deflated balloon.
[126:12.44]It's not even pointing the right way.
[126:28.02]Alright, so that's the end of his hand.
[126:29.38]I'll fix it.
[126:30.28]He's down there looking like a clown.
[126:38.46]Alright, that's his arm.
[126:40.40]Okay.
[126:56.49]So that's the end of his arm.
[126:57.53]Moving up into here.
[126:59.73]Into his, like, bicep.
[127:04.21]Oh my god, this is... What the fuck have I done?
[127:09.75]I gotta keep track of who is who.
[127:12.79]Because this is bicep into shoulder.
[127:20.21]Okay.
[127:21.07]So he... This guy didn't even see him coming.
[127:27.57]By the way, it doesn't, this doesn't matter because I just needed to, I just needed to look over the edge.
[127:39.09]It just needs to be up, when we take the picture, it just needs to be above there.
[127:52.06]Alright, so... Arm, and we're gonna have shoulder.
[127:55.48]What does it look like?
[127:57.28]What's like a body look like?
[127:58.46]I don't even fucking know.
[128:00.42]Big cylinder here.
[128:02.82]Tilted a little bit.
[128:15.69]Okay.
[128:16.75]That's like chest.
[128:17.65]Chest.
[128:19.92]I can carve it a little more.
[128:21.60]Hold on.
[128:21.98]OK, let's go down here.
[128:48.67]They don't need to see the rest of the body.
[128:50.85]And by they, I mean you.
[128:52.41]And by you, I mean me.
[128:54.33]And by people, I mean anyone.
[128:58.85]No, you don't have to see the whole thing.
[129:00.31]Because look, I'm going to move him over here.
[129:07.01]He's got somebody's head as a wristband.
[129:15.09]Alright, let me just, let me move them over here.
[129:33.83]Maybe I need, okay, I might need a little bit of legs.
[129:45.01]Like that.
[129:45.77]That'll be up a little bit higher.
[129:51.15]And more this way.
[130:05.27]Nah, that's better.
[130:16.14]I love how this shit is moving, but he's not.
[130:21.15]So the head doesn't matter because we don't need a head on him.
[130:26.19]He needs a body.
[130:26.89]I need to take a good screenshot too.
[130:35.08]Alright, we need a body on him.
[130:36.24]Maybe hair too.
[130:42.46]Alright, get back in here.
[130:56.65]It's a long ass neck.
[131:06.83]No, no, no, no, no.
[131:09.35]Come down and we'll go like this.
[131:28.58]No, that's not his leg.
[131:29.56]That's his collarbone.
[131:36.64]What is the point of this?
[131:38.17]To just use the program and learn how to use it.
[131:41.65]And be comfortable using it.
[131:44.91]Is pretty much the point.
[131:51.46]He's got like a ruffled shirt on.
[131:58.66]And then this has to be a little bigger.
[132:07.23]And arms will come out of here.
[132:13.36]We got a paint job to do too.
[132:23.51]He's made out of party cups.
[132:37.95]He's made out of paper cups!
[132:40.97]Who cares?
[132:41.77]He just wanted to be a real boy.
[132:52.42]Alright, alright, alright.
[133:00.38]See, from here it doesn't even matter.
[133:04.90]I was making a nice scene too and then everyone got like mad because I wasn't doing anything.
[133:11.28]So then I came over and made Paper Cup Monster get punched through his head.
[133:15.34]Are you happy now?
[133:22.27]Are you happy that I made this now?
[133:29.86]Now we're angrier than before.
[133:31.56]Alright, let me paint this.
[133:38.46]I need paint.
[133:43.71]Uh... Spray can.
[133:45.03]Where is it?
[133:48.09]What about the other guy's head?
[133:49.01]Well, hold on.
[133:49.87]I need to get this done first.
[133:53.07]Um... These are like... It's paper cups, right?
[134:04.07]It's like fucking solo cups.
[134:06.53]Snap to surface.
[134:07.33]Let's paint.
[134:15.41]Can that face be a new emote?
[134:17.85]No, we can only get one new emote.
[134:20.77]And then we'll get the circle.
[134:22.77]It's easiest to paint with.
[134:25.14]And spray can.
[134:28.56]And red.
[134:29.12]It's not that dark.
[134:33.16]I guess maybe it is.
[134:53.76]That's a great color.
[134:56.82]Red party cups.
[135:04.72]Proceed to party.
[135:14.55]Where the hell am I?
[135:16.95]What the hell just happened?
[135:28.90]Be careful I don't go all the way up.
[135:44.35]Okay.
[135:51.77]Oh, this is no longer, I don't think, party cups anymore.
[135:54.43]I think this is just the guy's, like, spine.
[136:01.21]I'm gonna make them plastic though, so... Hold your horses.
[136:14.76]Tighten this up just a little bit.
[136:28.74]Okay.
[136:33.33]I also have to make this a different group.
[136:34.84]Uh-oh.
[136:38.44]Because if I change the coat on this, it's not going to look right for the rest of the person.
[136:44.70]So... Get me out of here.
[137:03.43]Get out of this.
[137:06.59]Okay, so this is... Uh-oh.
[137:10.67]I didn't think this through.
[137:11.47]I just kind of was making it because this needs to be a completely separate thing from the group so I can change this without changing that.
[137:26.84]Yeah, see, I was supposed to start a new... I should have started a new sculpture down here.
[137:33.27]I could just erase the neck.
[137:36.12]But it's still part of the same sculpture, though.
[137:38.44]Yeah, I can't break it up.
[137:46.78]Shit!
[137:54.07]Wait, can I?
[137:56.71]Cut out.
[138:00.93]Um...
[138:03.53]I'm not sure what it means by cut out.
[138:05.85]Like, cut out the... Hold on.
[138:12.85]Will it just take this whole thing?
[138:14.01]Let me try... I can see the whole thing.
[138:24.40]Ah!
[138:37.31]I... Let's see what happens.
[138:41.35]Uh... Did I get it?
[138:48.12]Makes it a separate sculpture.
[138:49.40]I don't think I really got it.
[138:53.32]Um... Give me the shape.
[138:54.62]Give me the square.
[139:12.90]alright how are they all in I think they're all in right not quite oh my god it's so hard to control this and get it in the right spot I wish I could have the camera stay put like actually stay in one spot
[139:39.54]I don't want the camera to follow me around everywhere.
[139:41.58]I wish I could just keep the camera just, like, up here.
[139:44.58]Just keep it there.
[139:46.46]I don't think you can.
[139:48.56]Because every time I move, it moves the camera forward.
[139:54.85]Did I get it?
[139:55.29]I kind of got it.
[140:04.01]I missed the bottom.
[140:08.44]That's good enough.
[140:12.34]So now, what do I do with that now?
[140:14.80]That's it?
[140:15.24]It's just its own sculpture.
[140:20.22]Okay, cool.
[140:20.64]Alright.
[140:25.38]So let's give it a finish.
[140:29.63]Shiny, where's plastic?
[140:31.21]Plastic.
[140:36.97]It's already there.
[140:37.79]I need something better than that, shiny.
[140:43.12]I'm not really seeing a difference at all.
[140:48.32]Shiny metal.
[140:54.88]Hmm.
[140:56.98]Shiny wax.
[140:58.56]Shiny.
[140:59.26]Plastic.
[141:00.10]Rough.
[141:01.10]Metal.
[141:07.83]Go back to here.
[141:08.77]Shiny.
[141:13.06]I don't really see a difference.
[141:14.88]I mean, I guess a little.
[141:15.62]I guess it is shiny, huh?
[141:27.76]A little shiny wax.
[141:30.83]No, that just makes it look weird.
[141:39.51]Mmmmm!
[141:45.89]Well, I mean, it's on there.
[141:49.79]Change the lighting.
[141:50.65]Isn't there a way to turn on studio lighting or something?
[142:15.33]It's in the guides.
[142:17.55]There it is.
[142:19.59]Studio lighting.
[142:26.32]That's one thing that I don't think there was a tutorial for lighting.
[142:43.08]Let me just paint the rest of this.
[142:50.10]So this is going to be, we'll just go with a... I don't know.
[142:58.93]Orange, something blue.
[143:01.15]Big like Frost Demon, Frost Giant.
[143:04.86]That's what it's going to be.
[143:16.58]Shit, his head is also a part of this.
[143:31.99]Well that didn't really turn out exactly what I was looking for.
[144:07.24]Well, okay.
[144:09.32]Close the context menu.
[144:12.15]What happens if I...
[144:36.87]That's like all fucked up I need here.
[144:42.35]Here's the problem.
[144:44.41]I know what the problem is
[145:16.35]Oops.
[145:42.16]Hmm.
[145:44.30]Don't know what you're looking at?
[145:45.10]Neither do I.
[145:52.05]All I know is I need more grass.
[146:23.06]mm-hmm okay I need more like snow and too this has got to be much more pronounced than it is and these tops need to be changed
[147:03.09]That's what I'm talking about.
[147:05.49]Should have been like this since the very beginning.
[147:11.53]Not individual pieces.
[147:25.92]Closer.
[147:28.75]They look like clouds.
[147:29.75]Yeah.
[147:30.13]I think they're just kind of wind.
[147:33.39]I'm going to paint snow on.
[147:36.01]That's a finishing touch, though.
[147:37.15]We're not closing it.
[147:40.63]We're going to do the same thing over here.
[147:41.89]I need to add texture to this shit, too.
[147:52.68]Because it looks like shit.
[147:54.70]Those mountains look like shit.
[147:57.12]You can say it.
[147:57.60]You're not going to hurt my feelings.
[147:58.54]They look like dog shit.
[148:01.00]Say it.
[148:02.56]Don't worry.
[148:03.50]I can handle it.
[148:08.12]You know what?
[149:10.69]The trees are moving, right?
[149:11.82]It's a big tree, hold on.
[149:47.66]I need some more color.
[149:53.33]I'm not sure I like this.
[149:58.95]You know what I mean?
[149:59.85]I don't think I like it.
[150:00.55]I don't think it adds anything.
[150:08.74]No, I don't like it.
[150:11.12]Alright, now we're going to do a little bit of work down here, because there needs to be some more rocks.
[150:14.62]This is too plain.
[150:15.38]Looks like a textured... No, this is going to be more detail.
[150:19.75]They call me Jeremy Mr. Detail Elbertson.
[150:32.13]No, they don't.
[150:32.71]Yes, they do.
[150:34.26]Yes, they do.
[150:34.68]Okay.
[150:38.94]Okay.
[150:40.70]paint.
[150:41.90]Let's get some snow up here.
[150:43.30]I'm going to start with the snow.
[150:47.64]I think a splat would look good.
[150:50.39]Splat with... Let's see.
[151:00.01]Make it nice and... Let's get the white here.
[151:25.99]No, I don't need the kaleidoscope.
[151:32.62]Unnecessary.
[151:33.29]Don't need it.
[152:06.29]What is it on?
[152:06.95]Stamp?
[152:10.87]Brush.
[152:13.29]Brush is fine.
[152:21.75]Paint.
[152:22.31]Same deal.
[152:23.04]No, no, no, no.
[152:23.48]What are you doing?
[152:24.64]What the hell are you doing?
[152:27.06]Splat.
[152:30.12]Right there.
[152:30.60]Okay.
[152:34.38]Why is it blue?
[152:41.02]Shiny default rough.
[152:46.93]I want it to be this color.
[152:48.83]Why is it blue?
[152:54.76]Am I missing something here?
[153:13.97]Can I, like... No, this is a different sculpture now.
[153:17.76]Oh, what the fuck.
[153:21.08]It actually doesn't look bad.
[153:22.00]Let's shrink it a little bit.
[153:46.19]More clouds?
[153:46.91]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[153:49.49]Not yet.
[153:55.00]I need to go... This.
[153:59.84]The top should be snow-covered, right?
[154:07.92]Um... What?
[154:11.79]The fuck happened there?
[154:30.68]Oops.
[154:32.10]No, it's because it's on Snap.
[154:36.63]It's kind of hard to fucking even see what you're doing.
[154:53.86]He's doing Yoshi's Island?
[154:55.12]Yeah!
[154:56.24]Yeah, you get it!
[155:17.37]Doesn't look like snow though.
[155:18.77]I guess it kind of does.
[155:19.85]The clouds sort of ruin it.
[155:36.93]There needs to be a different color.
[155:38.17]It needs to be like blue or light blue.
[155:43.01]It does have to be blue because the more this has to be lighter.
[155:51.32]Alright, back in.
[156:00.25]Make the snow glossy?
[156:01.47]Yeah, I could do that too.
[156:07.75]Fuck.
[156:18.61]Ooh, I like this.
[156:29.94]Don't you want to just lick this mountain?
[156:31.94]I do.
[156:42.27]I think I can make it a little bit bigger.
[156:44.09]Maybe not.
[156:50.08]It's getting caught on itself.
[156:54.06]And then I also have to do some more detail to the mountains themselves.
[157:10.33]Oh, it's the shadow.
[157:11.85]I get it.
[157:12.25]Okay.
[157:12.73]I was going to say, why is it changing color?
[157:31.45]Oh, God.
[157:31.87]I'm going to throw up.
[157:34.42]Oof.
[157:42.44]Now I'm going to do the tip last.
[157:46.21]Do you think I can copy this and put it over on the other sculptures?
[157:55.49]I mean, that's cheating.
[157:58.75]But it's okay.
[158:07.28]You don't think I can cheat this?
[158:17.69]Alright, let's get up here and get the peak.
[158:21.05]I'm not gonna make it snow.
[158:40.13]Yes!
[158:47.05]It's a little grassy looking, but it's alright.
[158:56.53]I'm gonna fluff it up a little bit.
[159:09.56]Oops!
[159:12.70]We need the styles.
[159:16.03]Looseness.
[159:16.59]Alright, here we go.
[159:17.37]Might be a little too loose.
[159:53.09]That's alright.
[159:55.53]That don't look terrible.
[160:07.13]Ruffle them up?
[160:09.41]Nah, I'll pull it back.
[160:10.23]I think that looks fine.
[160:16.49]This is a little heavy over here though.
[160:23.41]I think I need to move this a little or shave a little bit off because it's a little heavy handed over here.
[160:29.44]Just a little.
[160:41.57]This little part kicking up right here.
[160:49.98]Right there.
[161:10.51]I can't get this one.
[161:14.31]There it is.
[161:16.91]Alright.
[161:17.65]I think that's good.
[161:21.22]Ooh.
[161:24.23]Now, should I make these bigger and drop them?
[161:39.48]Ooh.
[161:44.56]Oops.
[161:48.50]I don't think I even need these ones.
[161:49.98]Oh, come on.
[161:59.47]I need to add a little bit over here.
[162:01.05]It's a little too intense, I think.
[162:35.28]Drop it even lower.
[162:43.46]I think I'm getting rid of this one.
[162:44.58]Let me see what it looks like.
[162:46.46]Yeah.
[162:48.33]Yeah.
[162:48.73]I mean, like, yeah.
[162:50.45]See you later.
[162:50.89]That's gone.
[162:51.75]Wait a minute.
[162:52.07]I think I'm just going to shave it.
[162:55.15]I need more, like, over here.
[162:56.27]I need to add lore.
[163:02.04]Not yet.
[163:02.96]I can't do that yet.
[163:06.68]My housemates are gonna think I'm fucking insane if they hear three seconds of that song again.
[163:19.88]You just keep replaying a MIDI version of Bohemian Rhapsody.
[163:27.71]No, they're not gonna think you're insane.
[163:29.33]They're gonna think you're learning how to play that song on the piano.
[163:33.21]And you keep starting over, over and over again.
[163:36.41]to learn the first 10 to 20 notes.
[163:41.88]Jeremy's going through a rough patch?
[163:43.50]What are you talking about?
[163:44.46]Hey, get off my case, okay?
[163:48.20]I'm trying to learn how to play Dreams.
[164:00.53]I might just turn this into like a fucking super expressionist broad painting here.
[164:06.87]That means I can move this out.
[164:13.14]Make these a little bit... No, no, no, no.
[164:15.76]No, no, no, no.
[164:19.36]Look at how fucking huge this is.
[164:21.25]Alright, the tree's too big.
[164:22.77]I figured out the problem.
[164:27.75]The trees are too big.
[164:28.73]Now it looks better.
[164:38.78]Now we got skill.
[164:40.12]That didn't look good.
[164:43.92]What happened here?
[164:47.42]Sorry, we're not taking the picture from that side anyways.
[165:00.83]We're taking the picture from... I don't know.
[165:07.22]This is a three hour long bit.
[165:10.08]No, there is no joke here.
[165:12.96]Look, not everything has to be a joke.
[165:15.48]Okay?
[165:15.92]You know, and in fact... No.
[165:21.30]We're just doing a mountain scene.
[165:31.89]Fine.
[165:41.91]How does it... Okay.
[165:43.49]I know.
[165:43.83]Your roommates are gonna fucking kill you.
[165:45.72]I know.
[165:46.06]Okay.
[165:46.64]I took care of it.
[165:52.52]These need to be changed.
[165:53.42]These gotta look a little different.
[165:58.61]By the way, I'm going for it.
[166:07.85]No, don't ever tell me that you can't, like, change that and make that look alright.
[166:12.19]I'm taking a photo.
[166:18.77]Look, you'll see what it's going to turn into.
[166:30.80]It's balding.
[166:33.74]It's not balding.
[166:40.76]OK, I want to rotate this.
[167:00.03]Not bad.
[167:00.95]It's alright.
[167:01.57]Not bad.
[167:07.14]These need to be changed, they need to look a little better.
[167:09.90]Gotta add some more patterns on them, some more rocks.
[167:11.66]Woo!
[167:36.59]Try and play Dreams, goddammit.
[167:45.55]No, no, no, no, no.
[167:46.32]Get up here.
[167:51.24]I fucked it all up.
[168:07.32]Oh, Mom, I'm studying!
[168:11.56]I thought you were going to show me the Vegas Strip.
[168:14.03]No!
[168:14.31]Fuck.
[168:23.41]Ooh!
[168:23.81]There needs to be more.
[168:26.49]More snow across it.
[168:27.47]I'll fix it.
[168:31.35]This is going to be nice and tidy in a minute.
[168:33.09]I'm just trying to get the gist of it here.
[168:49.13]Rome wasn't built in a day.
[168:53.61]It was built in like fucking over the course of 75 years.
[169:02.48]Results, results, results.
[169:03.68]I'll give you results.
[169:04.80]You just gotta wait a little bit.
[169:10.85]Just wait till I make my first video game.
[169:15.45]On this screen.
[169:31.93]No, that's really fucking terrible looking.
[169:39.26]I just don't need it.
[169:39.86]Mmm, not bad.
[169:56.65]Maybe even more.
[169:57.54]Ends lower.
[170:16.16]A little too much snow Facial hair mountain
[170:53.82]Turn.
[170:54.46]Tilt.
[170:56.62]Grab.
[170:57.82]Tilt.
[171:08.31]This just has more snow on it.
[171:09.45]It's fine.
[171:14.69]Alright.
[171:16.15]We're getting there.
[171:26.11]Now I need to make a... This has to come out a little bit further.
[171:29.87]There's not enough trees.
[171:36.51]There's got to be... Maybe like a body... A body of... A body... What?
[171:44.97]Body of water.
[171:46.27]Body of water.
[171:49.05]Yeah.
[171:49.45]Yup.
[171:53.74]Check this out.
[171:54.52]Alright, this is gonna be done right.
[171:56.42]I'm gonna make like a big body of water right here, a big ice lake.
[172:08.38]How am I gonna do that though?
[172:12.25]Paint tool?
[172:21.57]And then do like circle?
[172:24.45]Now what does that look like?
[172:25.59]Let me just see what this looks like.
[172:30.55]No, it's gotta be denser than that.
[172:35.97]Although it might not need to be.
[172:46.06]That could be decent water.
[172:51.40]Hmm.
[173:04.96]If it's painted on thick enough, it will be alright, I think.
[173:13.19]Maybe a little bit of a... Let's see.
[173:22.23]No, that's fine.
[173:25.61]And then I can do flow on it.
[173:26.71]But what are the other, let me see the other shapes.
[173:30.50]Square.
[173:42.46]Let's see, compare the two.
[173:45.89]This one's a little more pixely.
[173:50.33]Although I could do a different stroke here.
[173:51.87]Let's try heavy.
[173:59.51]That's heavy.
[174:02.13]Although, this looks like ice crystals.
[174:12.97]You know what I'm saying?
[174:16.41]This is more water-like, but this is ice crystals and chunks of ice.
[174:19.59]Let me try something here.
[174:22.15]Hold on.
[174:25.73]Check this out.
[174:27.08]Now let's go with the square.
[174:29.56]I'm going to change this.
[174:55.01]Can I do a custom one of these?
[174:56.66]Okay, I think I can.
[175:05.30]Pure mixed.
[175:07.24]Save color, clear mixer.
[175:09.06]Let's go with this.
[175:15.70]Add.
[175:17.18]And then mix, tumble.
[175:19.84]What?
[175:25.72]Save color.
[175:28.80]And then can I mix them up to make it so it's a gradient like the other ones?
[175:37.86]Whoa.
[175:38.89]That's not what I wanted.
[175:43.55]There has to be a way to get that to do my own gradient.
[176:02.64]L1 in direction.
[176:03.46]Yeah, it's just changing the frame.
[176:05.99]Mixed.
[176:07.37]We'll wait.
[176:09.51]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[176:10.17]Get over here.
[176:16.43]Pure.
[176:17.79]Mixed.
[176:22.80]I don't get it.
[176:23.22]I want to make my own gradient.
[176:34.36]Oh well, fuck it.
[176:37.28]We're just going to go with like a light blue.
[176:43.48]Alright, you can get out of here now.
[176:55.17]I actually kind of like the crystal-y ice looking one.
[176:58.59]And I'll add the flow to it and comb it.
[177:04.78]This is the most water-like, but I like this one.
[177:06.80]Alright, here we go.
[177:12.80]So I need this to be a... I need like a zone here.
[177:18.29]What do I want this?
[177:19.01]I want this to start here and come out this way.
[177:23.67]Like that.
[177:24.17]And go over here.
[177:29.16]Let's try it.
[177:36.87]It was this one.
[177:39.79]And it was this color.
[177:41.53]It was this light one.
[177:44.33]And it was wax, shiny metal, shiny.
[177:48.75]It is water.
[177:49.25]Okay.
[177:52.21]Okay.
[177:58.56]No, this won't be that much work.
[177:59.62]Check this out.
[178:00.12]Watch this.
[178:02.42]I'm just gonna do it flat.
[178:03.20]I'm gonna zoom out.
[178:04.78]I'm gonna get a ballpark here.
[178:06.52]We'll do flat like this and check it out.
[178:08.48]One, two, three.
[178:16.92]Why is it on kaleidoscope?
[178:19.86]Um, I never picked kaleidoscope, did I?
[178:22.78]Wait, what the fuck is going on here?
[178:26.47]What are you talking about?
[178:29.79]Well, um, okay.
[178:37.61]Looks like I'm just gonna have to paint a big one in front of my face.
[178:39.79]And we're just gonna have to scale it.
[179:07.00]Hydrate.
[179:09.22]I will.
[179:10.78]When I go on a break, I will.
[179:12.28]Don't worry.
[179:12.60]I will hydrate properly.
[179:13.70]Yeah, this looks nice and icy.
[179:28.83]Once it starts to move around a little bit and I shape it.
[179:33.59]How big does it need to be?
[179:41.03]actually pretty big, so let's make it actually much bigger.
[179:43.33]Alright, here we go.
[180:01.50]Let's try it.
[180:02.48]Let's just get it in there and see if I can... I can always fix it later.
[180:08.33]Well...
[180:10.39]Okay.
[180:11.69]Did not know that was happening.
[180:13.75]So we're going to take the... Give me a break.
[180:31.10]Okay.
[180:32.26]This one...
[180:42.64]Let's just get it over there.
[180:43.58]I need to just get it out here.
[180:58.89]I can add to it in a minute.
[181:00.43]Let's put it right here.
[181:04.99]So I need a lot more paint on this.
[181:12.22]a lot more and then it has to wrap around here let's go okay bring it over here what are you doing uh let's do brush is fine I'm gonna snap to surface be
[181:45.21]So it should be snapping to here.
[181:46.31]Alright, here we go.
[181:59.30]Why is this a different color?
[182:07.81]It's not.
[182:08.45]It's just a weird shadow.
[182:17.17]And there's a spot here that I need to fill in.
[182:32.56]There we go.
[182:35.12]Imagine playing MS Paint with a PS4 controller.
[182:43.68]I mean, I think you're wrong, but you're also not wrong at the same time.
[182:49.25]You know what I mean?
[183:02.45]OK.
[183:02.77]It does look pretty icy.
[183:04.69]It needs to come across here.
[183:24.20]I mean, we don't care about what it looks like underneath at the moment.
[183:31.20]It just needs to exist.
[183:41.73]Because all that matters is like here.
[183:43.99]A little bit over here too.
[184:00.81]Messy, but it'll get the job done.
[184:02.85]It will.
[184:11.41]No.
[184:13.21]It don't matter.
[184:13.90]It don't matter.
[184:14.32]It just needs to get the job done.
[184:15.52]Because guess what?
[184:24.64]Now I put like a boulder over here.
[184:42.11]Check this.
[184:42.57]Ready?
[184:48.24]No, give me the... Give me this.
[184:49.82]I'm just going to see.
[184:54.39]I'm just going to test something.
[185:22.90]Okay, then it's going to come up here.
[185:24.45]Actually, one big one right here.
[185:44.73]Okay, I just got a quest.
[185:46.37]Okay, this is the worst part, right?
[185:48.77]I want to move it down, but I can't move it down because it moves my imp.
[185:55.96]I just want to move this thing I'm holding straight down.
[186:03.09]It's almost like I have to go at a strange angle to move this back and forth where I want to.
[186:21.43]Like, I don't want to move the camera forward.
[186:23.34]I want to move this forward.
[186:26.86]You know what I'm saying?
[186:31.06]I... Like, this is... The tutorial... I mean, I did the tutorials already.
[186:46.55]Because I can go like this.
[186:47.91]I can move in and out and all around...
[186:52.61]I can circle, I can go up and down, left and right, but I want to just move this thing that I'm holding forward and backward.
[187:02.20]You know what I'm saying?
[187:06.06]Is it the snap surface thing?
[187:07.50]Okay.
[187:14.89]Oh, Jesus Christ, that's not what I wanted to do.
[187:25.61]Yeah, but even still though, okay, so snap surface is off.
[187:28.86]And this is where it gets weird.
[187:29.78]Alright, so when I'm holding a device and I hold back, the camera doesn't move.
[187:38.22]It's like weird how the camera, this controls the camera and it also controls, see what I'm saying?
[187:45.17]I don't wanna move forward.
[187:48.79]I just wanna move this.
[187:49.93]Let me move this thing forward.
[187:51.63]No, let's move the camera too.
[187:54.91]That's awful.
[187:59.68]Does it have to do that?
[188:02.28]This is to lock the camera.
[188:04.46]But when you lock the camera, you just move in and out and all around.
[188:06.90]There has to be a way where you can not move the camera and just move the device.
[188:18.25]You would think it would be maybe like one of the Rs?
[188:20.98]No, let's rewind.
[188:24.78]Well, whatever.
[188:25.36]That's a minor complaint, but it is... I just don't like when the camera moves.
[188:29.24]I wish I could just stop the camera from moving.
[188:39.20]You know, let's get out... No, no, no, no, no.
[188:55.24]No, I want the rounded one.
[189:02.13]No, I don't.
[189:02.75]What do I want?
[189:04.45]What do I want?
[189:05.17]There we go.
[189:30.41]No, too fleshy.
[189:32.23]That's not terrible.
[189:49.79]No!
[190:07.26]It's his hand coming up from the other side.
[190:15.79]It's somebody else reaching up here.
[190:17.75]There's somebody down here.
[190:26.74]No, no.
[190:30.18]Alright, let's get this rock and frosty colored.
[190:32.28]And then I got to change this because this needs to be like a little, this has to be, well, it could be just ice.
[190:38.10]Doesn't have to be that.
[190:43.83]It's a giant drowned in the lake.
[190:47.61]You know, I'm sure this looks really good in his head.
[190:50.87]It didn't look like anything in my head.
[190:59.28]You know what?
[190:59.62]Yeah, fuck it.
[191:00.08]That's a metal hand.
[191:26.48]Change the tint.
[191:37.05]This is going to be called the War of the Giants.
[191:45.89]What color do I want this to be?
[191:47.07]Don't you think it should be called that?
[191:58.66]Okay, that looks better.
[191:59.42]And now let's shape the K. Hold on.
[192:02.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[192:10.55]That's hand.
[192:13.71]Grabbing.
[192:14.29]It's like right hand.
[192:15.77]Face needs to be here.
[192:19.60]Or here.
[192:28.85]Now I want some Junior Mints.
[192:33.42]Hold on.
[192:38.08]Just wait.
[192:38.88]Wait.
[192:39.32]I'm studying.
[192:43.14]Let me open up the menu.
[192:44.06]Let me check.
[192:44.54]I got to do the ice first.
[192:45.46]Hold on.
[192:46.22]Everybody's freaking out.
[192:52.00]I need some glow.
[192:54.09]Needs to be bright blue.
[193:06.65]Okay.
[193:09.17]The finish is already a shiny metal.
[193:12.80]Let's go ahead and apply it though.
[193:17.38]Ooh.
[193:20.02]Not that shiny.
[193:26.16]Okay.
[193:28.10]Let's go to effects.
[193:31.27]Flow!
[193:45.18]Too much flow.
[193:52.18]It is ice, you're right.
[193:54.97]We need a little bit, though.
[193:58.83]Just a little.
[194:02.27]No, no, you're right.
[194:03.03]No flow.
[194:05.59]Boil.
[194:09.85]It's boiling.
[194:26.11]Yeah, because there's going to be fire flowing down into it.
[194:28.37]No, stop it.
[194:29.25]Stop it.
[194:29.57]Just like, I need to finish this thing.
[194:32.96]Wasn't I going to make like a game?
[194:34.10]Alright, I need... How are these looking?
[194:50.77]These are moving a little bit.
[194:51.79]We need some more sounds.
[194:55.00]What is playing right now?
[194:58.38]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[195:03.76]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[195:19.69]That's too much wind.
[195:30.82]It's kind of spinning around.
[195:31.82]Where is... Holy shit.
[195:36.16]Whoa!
[195:59.40]I don't hate this.
[196:00.26]If I'm going to make it a little bit smaller.
[196:01.94]Wait, hold on.
[196:38.91]It's like the ice.
[196:42.23]Okay, hold on.
[196:42.89]I need to get... I've got an idea.
[196:45.39]Idea, idea, idea.
[196:46.31]Back it up.
[196:48.89]I'm going to make more of this on the ice.
[196:50.41]Okay, close this.
[197:05.80]Let's make this a little cleaner.
[197:16.50]Alright, so now... I want to put... Check this shit out.
[197:25.90]You want to see a real 5 trillion IQ hyper brain?
[197:35.85]We're going to do some lines here.
[197:39.67]Just a few.
[197:40.29]Just like one of them.
[197:41.45]Two of them.
[197:47.26]paint mode we're going to do a uh don't want the surface snap I want a straight line and I want it to be a mist so I don't know this doesn't look bad the scribble is okay I think the scribble will do it let me see what the scribble looks like
[198:15.53]Yeah, absolutely.
[198:17.09]Okay.
[198:18.69]So here, let's show... I'm going to show you what I'm talking about here.
[198:23.73]We're going to get the scribble.
[198:24.63]I'm going to make sure it is white.
[198:29.27]Or blue.
[198:31.43]Yeah!
[198:33.01]Yeah, it's going to be blue.
[198:34.74]Oh, just wait until you see what happens.
[198:36.04]You're going to fucking... Everyone's going to resubscribe.
[198:39.14]After you unsubscribe.
[198:42.98]Everyone's going to just re-subscribe right now.
[198:45.29]Okay, here we go.
[199:00.96]Alright.
[199:02.86]Okay.
[199:04.88]Easy.
[199:07.72]Take this.
[199:17.65]Alright Hold on hold on
[199:54.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[200:00.16]Inside sphere.
[200:01.44]Now I need... Wait, we've got five community subs!
[200:16.64]Holy shit, five community subs.
[200:18.58]Are you fucking shitting me?
[200:25.42]Thank you to Torati for the five subs.
[200:30.43]Where's the way I can make it so they... It's like pulse or something.
[200:36.19]Fade in, fade out.
[200:37.63]No, no, no.
[200:39.59]It's called something.
[200:43.03]What the fuck is it called?
[200:44.27]It's called like pulse.
[200:46.43]Where is it?
[200:53.10]Pulse.
[200:53.74]Where is it?
[200:54.30]I know it exists.
[200:57.42]Pulse.
[201:02.67]Ooh.
[201:04.31]Okay.
[201:16.92]Okay, hold on.
[201:36.53]On Plain, Inside Sphere.
[201:38.41]I think Inside Sphere is probably the best.
[201:42.19]This guy hates his fans.
[201:45.11]Salmon or Breakfast?
[201:46.40]Uh... Salmon is, I think, is... I definitely didn't say anything, but I'm gonna say Salmon.
[201:55.20]There, there's like a little bit of mist.
[201:58.17]Scale, Jitter.
[202:06.04]Probably like that.
[202:06.66]And then we can do... We can take off the fades.
[202:19.70]Maybe do the playback.
[202:20.60]Maybe do it faster.
[202:21.74]Where's like playback speed?
[202:23.70]No, no, no, no, no.
[202:37.88]Now, what would that even be?
[202:39.50]Now, all I have to do is go like this.
[202:51.29]Check this out.
[202:53.37]I'm going to do like 5 or 2 or 3%.
[202:55.13]This is going to be underneath the ice, is what I'm going for here.
[203:01.53]So it's going to be like crackling ice.
[203:04.77]Yeah.
[203:11.15]Now you get it There we go Now we can just stretch it out a little
[203:46.05]That's what I want right there.
[203:47.13]Come on, do the dumb thing I want.
[204:04.86]Oh, it's so close.
[204:05.74]No, don't touch that.
[204:09.25]It's so close.
[204:34.38]Ooh!
[204:34.72]Ooh!
[205:02.44]I like it.
[205:05.34]I think that's alright.
[205:14.49]I almost wish I had it broken up a little bit more.
[205:16.19]Let me look at it one more time.
[205:17.15]Definitely doesn't need to be that bright.
[205:27.44]Are you kidding me?
[205:29.46]Like, are you kidding me?
[205:39.46]There's a goddamn old one under there.
[205:41.66]How's that look?
[206:14.95]I like it like that.
[206:18.41]And then check this.
[206:18.99]What we're going to do is this.
[206:23.68]I'm going to mess that up a little bit more.
[206:26.82]We need a little bit more.
[206:33.20]We need a... Okay, clones.
[206:35.87]We need less clones.
[206:41.85]That's so much better.
[206:42.57]Look at that.
[206:45.92]I love it.
[206:46.60]I don't think I want to change anything.
[206:52.10]Except for that.
[206:52.64]Fuck.
[207:27.88]I got it.
[207:38.03]And wait, wait, wait, wait.
[207:38.89]That's not all.
[207:39.33]That's not all.
[207:39.77]Hold on.
[207:44.57]I'm going to loosen it up a little so it doesn't look so... Let's see how that looks.
[208:05.35]ruined what do you mean ruined did I ruin it yeah it's a little too yeah a little too much okay what about okay this is important no it's not this is here we go let's try roughing it out oops wow look at that ice
[208:38.29]And it made it perfect.
[208:41.62]That's perfect.
[208:57.60]Loosen it up a little bit, though.
[209:05.50]That doesn't need to be as harsh.
[209:10.13]Now I have to change the sky.
[209:11.37]I will.
[209:13.57]I will.
[209:13.85]Don't worry.
[209:14.65]I will.
[209:14.99]Alright.
[209:42.00]Let's get a sun over here.
[209:44.64]How do I cover them?
[209:45.98]More trees that look bad in just one corner.
[209:49.70]Yeah, you're right.
[209:53.82]You're right.
[209:55.92]You're right.
[209:56.38]No, you are.
[209:56.76]I'm going to say let's get over here maybe.
[210:12.01]We're gonna play around with some scale here, guys.
[210:14.43]Watch this shit.
[210:24.49]That could be like a fucking mile away.
[210:46.45]What am I making?
[210:47.33]Oh, just kind of whatever at this point.
[210:49.33]I don't really have a plan.
[210:51.06]I'm just kind of making random stuff.
[210:55.34]Move this around, though.
[210:56.14]It looks too perfect.
[211:10.17]This has got to go on the ground.
[211:15.90]Put a little forest back here.
[211:17.54]That looks bad.
[211:40.52]Don't worry.
[211:40.82]I'm going to go in here and I'm going to ruffle them up.
[211:58.06]Coming together over there.
[211:58.86]Although this is a little too big.
[212:02.42]Did I fuck something up here?
[212:10.83]Oh, I did.
[212:11.25]Oops.
[212:12.57]Okay.
[212:26.42]Okay.
[212:30.39]Are the shirts in limited time?
[212:31.57]No, they're here forever.
[212:34.73]I gotta get the giant hair?
[212:35.69]I will.
[212:40.35]Okay, what?
[212:41.71]Um... Let me see the whole thing.
[212:45.57]What is this?
[212:55.26]I feel like I wanna... Alright.
[212:57.56]Hear me out on this one.
[213:33.90]I'm just a little too perfect for me Alright, that's okay let's do the snow too
[214:03.77]That's kind of cool looking.
[214:15.40]That is really cool looking, actually.
[214:19.04]They're frozen like that.
[214:27.75]No, let's...
[214:30.63]That's fine.
[214:31.29]It looks okay.
[214:32.61]Alright, let's do some work over here.
[214:41.30]This game seems amazing if you can't draw and want to make art for fun.
[214:48.34]All you have seen me do is just dick around.
[214:51.01]That's it.
[214:51.51]I haven't done anything else.
[214:59.74]I've done nothing else but dick around.
[215:04.15]Let's do a little bit of work here, though, because you need hair.
[215:16.80]What kind of hair, though?
[215:19.21]Snap it to... Yep.
[215:28.33]studio lighting.
[215:29.18]I want to change the lights.
[215:30.96]There has to be a way I can do that.
[215:33.20]Has to be.
[215:35.58]Right?
[215:39.83]Alright, here.
[215:41.27]He is made out of metal.
[215:44.89]Or stone, or whatever it's going to end up being.
[215:51.56]He looks like Beaker.
[215:52.52]Yeah, he's really not really supposed to be here.
[216:08.77]Wait, why is it... Oh, it's because it's shiny metal hair.
[216:16.46]Okay, right.
[216:18.30]Makes sense.
[216:26.71]Why do I feel like this is going to take up all the frame rate?
[216:50.05]This looks like the shittiest toupee you could ever wear.
[216:52.43]Am I gonna change this?
[217:09.80]Oops!
[217:15.24]Well, that's fine.
[217:15.94]Who cares?
[217:20.05]I'm gonna have like a little spike.
[217:29.45]No, it's a bird's nest.
[217:40.00]Just put a bird in here.
[217:51.92]What?
[217:59.99]He punched him so hard in his hair.
[218:04.51]Okay, well... It's because I'm drawing in 3D.
[218:13.62]It's because I have snapping on.
[218:26.78]Fuck it, let's go wild with this shit.
[218:28.38]Wild, yeah, you know, wild I say.
[219:07.61]His cosmic horror hair.
[219:23.63]You can't even tell what's going on from over here.
[219:32.30]Dude, I've got a fucking idea.
[219:34.28]Are you serious?
[219:35.42]You know what I'm going to do?
[219:36.38]Are you serious?
[219:38.36]I'm going to have to just... No, never mind.
[219:40.18]That's going to take like about three hours.
[219:41.49]I definitely have to make his hair flowing like crazy though.
[219:56.00]And he needs more hair up here.
[220:07.67]Smaller flex here.
[220:10.02]This is kind of getting out of hand.
[220:12.68]And I'm going to turn off the snapping.
[220:46.11]That's part of the platformer!
[220:47.57]I didn't... No, look!
[220:49.47]Wait, wait!
[220:50.27]Oh, boy!
[220:51.13]Mora!
[220:51.73]Oh, it's a step!
[220:52.43]Turning this into a level.
[220:59.61]You have to jump through here.
[221:00.55]You gotta go around the whole goddamn robot.
[221:08.59]The whole thing's gonna be scalable.
[221:20.08]Yeah, you're gonna run up his hair.
[221:23.84]So check this out.
[221:25.22]Alright, hold on.
[221:30.01]Down and, like, flowing down.
[221:32.67]I need to see from a better angle.
[221:39.03]Flow it down and come across... No, he's got... Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[221:44.99]The hair is gonna... There's gonna be another thing going on right here.
[221:54.25]We'll do that later.
[221:54.95]We're going to make a head right here.
[222:03.00]God damn it, this is so in the way.
[222:06.06]It's okay.
[222:35.02]She's got a tiny head.
[223:09.05]Okay.
[223:55.58]Is this on Steam?
[223:56.56]No, it's not.
[223:57.34]It's only for PlayStation 4, which is very unfortunate.
[224:00.03]Eyes need to be bigger.
[224:16.52]Nah, I like him better like this.
[224:19.72]He looks like a pumpkin.
[224:21.96]Just wait.
[224:24.03]Um...
[224:30.92]A little party hat?
[224:31.74]Is it a baseball cap?
[225:24.21]Now he needs to be metal.
[225:43.50]I'm going to tint him.
[225:46.40]He's going to have a purple hat.
[226:10.34]Whoa, wheezy.
[226:13.35]It's the Iron Giant.
[226:16.59]It kind of is the Iron Giant, in a way.
[226:18.13]Alright.
[226:19.21]Apply the finish.
[226:20.29]I want shiny metal.
[226:23.17]But I do not want it to be that stupid thing.
[226:25.65]I want it to be the, like, spray can.
[226:28.08]I don't know why it's on this dumb thing.
[226:36.44]It's on, like, the spray can.
[226:40.22]No...
[226:44.93]How did I get it off this before?
[226:46.03]I just wanted to do it.
[226:50.45]How did I get it off this before?
[226:51.53]I don't remember.
[226:52.33]It's over here.
[226:55.89]Okay.
[226:56.99]Apply finish.
[226:57.53]Let's make him nice and shiny.
[227:09.17]I don't like the color.
[227:20.33]No.
[227:20.53]Let's go back to, like, metal.
[227:23.21]Actual kind of chrome look.
[227:36.42]He looks like he's made out of wood.
[227:38.52]His head needs to be a little bigger, too.
[228:04.20]Okay.
[228:14.04]Okay.
[228:17.40]He's Mario.
[228:20.44]He looks like a Roblox character.
[228:24.26]Alright, now we're getting somewhere.
[228:27.26]Now we need to face over here, because that's his hand.
[228:52.55]I need to see from the other side.
[228:53.57]Here we go.
[229:05.00]Pull it out.
[229:15.01]Have him peeking over with a big nose?
[229:18.19]You mean like that cartoon character?
[229:26.06]That weird cartoon nose thing.
[229:27.96]Where's the hand?
[229:30.73]Right here.
[230:07.34]OK.
[230:15.34]Now, this is where we set up the blending options.
[230:30.29]OK, here we go.
[230:30.97]Edit shape.
[230:31.59]Oh, it needs to be stamp.
[230:33.65]It needs to be stamp.
[230:36.86]Is this mirror?
[230:38.04]Back it up.
[230:43.27]Stamp.
[230:45.09]Okay, now I should be able to do weird shit with this nose.
[230:57.04]Why not try to sculpt natural looking faces?
[230:59.02]I mean, because I'm trying to get used to the tools.
[231:05.15]You want me to make like a natural looking face?
[231:09.27]I just figured out how to pan.
[231:11.57]Like yesterday.
[231:15.82]Ow.
[231:15.98]Okay, blend amount.
[231:26.54]Let's see what this does.
[231:27.78]Because now I should be able to... Okay, let me see here.
[231:37.69]Yeah, look at this.
[231:51.10]Where is it?
[231:51.56]He's got to come out a little further.
[232:01.72]Hold on.
[232:19.32]This is not what I thought was going to be here.
[232:28.13]You can't even see this guy.
[232:31.41]It's got to be much smaller.
[232:55.79]There you go, that's better.
[232:56.59]Because it's going to get squished into here.
[233:12.59]Okay, what does that look like?
[233:13.57]That's not bad.
[233:34.96]That's not a tongue.
[233:35.92]This has to go down.
[233:38.58]This has to be changed.
[233:45.18]I actually think I can do it like this.
[233:59.79]That looks fine.
[234:06.74]Okay, make nostrils?
[234:08.94]Well, no, I can't make nostrils, because the nostrils are both flat down, like, sniffing the mountain.
[234:27.79]Yeah, he's going like... I'm gonna... Look, I'll show you.
[234:46.35]No, let me, I gotta go back and finish this.
[235:39.06]No, his eyes are bugging out of his head and he's staring at the mountain.
[235:53.97]Okay, what does this need to be?
[235:56.63]Down here.
[236:12.81]A little bit more to the right, like over here.
[236:18.99]Like that.
[236:25.36]Okay.
[236:29.86]Nose is here.
[236:30.80]I mean, I could put the nostrils here.
[236:34.90]You know.
[236:36.91]What about mouth?
[236:51.88]Maybe have it over here.
[236:53.66]Yeah.
[237:05.13]I don't hate it.
[237:05.63]Let me just see.
[237:25.14]He's taking a bite?
[237:26.00]No, he's just going like... Alright, that means... I don't know what the fuck's going on over here.
[237:38.61]I'm gonna have to turn these guys, I think, a little.
[237:42.09]And bring them down.
[237:42.71]This is a hand.
[237:54.98]Alright, let's do the eyes.
[237:58.30]Those are important!
[238:02.21]Let's get right where we need to be.
[238:04.71]Right here.
[238:10.95]Um, excuse me, what just happened?
[238:12.73]What's going on here?
[238:15.04]Oh.
[238:19.68]Okay, let's get the paint tool.
[238:22.64]Spray paint.
[238:27.48]And let's scare the shit out of everybody that's here.
[238:39.39]Because if you weren't concerned right now, you will be very soon.
[239:11.35]just be lower like this okay let's get some blue or I don't know black
[239:48.97]His eyeballs fade into the stalks.
[239:51.05]Okay.
[240:00.62]No, that eye is going to be pointed down.
[240:02.62]Like down here.
[240:09.72]Back it up.
[240:11.44]What is going on?
[240:14.74]Come back here.
[240:16.28]Where are you going?
[240:19.50]OK, so it needs to be crazed.
[240:34.45]Much better.
[240:42.05]OK.
[240:45.76]I wonder... Okay, so now I've got to make him not flesh-colored.
[240:51.29]He needs to be metal.
[240:57.13]You know what?
[240:57.48]Let's make it fucking even weirder.
[241:15.98]I don't think I can do that.
[241:17.08]No, that's alright.
[241:17.82]No, that's alright.
[241:18.28]I can leave it as is.
[241:21.14]These eyebrows?
[241:22.36]Yeah, I'll paint them on after.
[241:25.50]Maybe it should just be a big guy.
[241:27.26]Maybe it's just not even a robot.
[241:29.20]Although that would kind of break all the continuity.
[241:31.77]Like there ever was one to begin with.
[241:37.59]Give him more eyes.
[241:39.07]No.
[241:46.43]I got another three eyes pointing down.
[241:49.20]Just not yet, not yet, not yet.
[241:51.04]Hold on.
[241:54.10]I need to figure out.
[241:55.58]Alright, so he's this kind of chrome, almost bronze.
[242:06.40]Let's go in here.
[242:13.75]Let's get that coat of almost like a bronze like this.
[242:36.97]Apply the finish.
[242:51.03]Now that's fucking crazy.
[243:03.74]Maybe I might light him up a little bit.
[243:05.60]Let's make... Hold on.
[243:12.44]Maybe like gold.
[243:13.94]Yeah, this guy's gonna be gold.
[243:19.49]Oh no!
[243:20.01]His eyes!
[243:20.43]I can fix him.
[243:34.36]Am I not making you gold?
[243:37.33]There we go.
[243:39.23]Alright.
[243:56.35]Now let's do the finish again.
[243:57.74]Okay.
[244:08.20]I lost a little bit of the gold.
[244:10.02]Maybe I should lighten him up to a little bit more.
[244:11.90]Maybe that'll be better.
[244:14.14]No.
[244:15.92]I need like a brighter yellow.
[244:18.96]He's not cheese.
[244:22.78]Gold is like this.
[244:26.65]But I don't know if I can get... It might have to just be this kind of mustardy yellow.
[244:35.49]I gotta save the color.
[244:43.10]It just doesn't look the same.
[244:52.99]It doesn't look right.
[244:53.83]I guess that's close enough.
[245:04.38]No, I think that's because of the finish.
[245:08.82]Let me remove some of the finish.
[245:18.29]That's better.
[245:20.32]Alright, there's gold.
[245:26.02]Now let's go back to the eyes.
[245:33.06]And we'll make the eyes gold, too.
[245:43.95]Maybe we should make them physical.
[245:50.66]Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[246:13.18]Wait, why is it?
[246:13.62]Oh, OK.
[246:19.86]I was wondering why it looked like that.
[246:21.06]It's because it's metal.
[246:24.15]I don't want it.
[246:24.61]Let's just do default or plastic.
[246:27.68]That's better.
[246:28.14]Okay.
[246:49.36]fucking ice cream face oh god great lord walden just gave I think I'm gonna spray paint it it just doesn't look right what are you doing great lord walden is just giving 20 community subs over and over again twice in a row holy shit dude
[247:22.74]Thank you for the 40 community subs.
[247:27.16]Make it have eyelids.
[247:29.84]Let me paint it first.
[247:31.22]But that's a lot of fucking subs, dude.
[247:33.26]Thank you.
[247:35.28]That's an insane amount of subs.
[247:41.43]How do you know when you get one?
[247:44.71]Because I look over and I see it then blowing up in the chat.
[247:52.47]Alright, let's get the spray paint.
[247:57.25]It's going to be easier to do it like this.
[248:03.11]Circle.
[248:03.47]OK.
[248:11.21]Reason why it's not showing up?
[248:13.79]Any guesses?
[248:20.57]I have it on paint can.
[248:25.46]Hmm.
[248:26.36]Why?
[248:26.56]Am I missing something here?
[248:29.66]Maybe I need to just make it again.
[248:47.14]Maybe I have to... Let me see.
[248:50.90]New sculpture?
[248:51.58]No, it's just not coming up at all.
[248:58.84]That's weird.
[249:00.00]Maybe it's because I had the coat on already?
[249:03.54]I'll just do it the way I had it before.
[249:20.55]That's actually fucking horrifying, so I'm gonna keep it.
[249:42.86]That one's white, right?
[249:54.15]Why do you look like that?
[249:57.35]You're not metal.
[250:04.70]Why are you doing this to me?
[250:09.90]Well, oh, I gotta move on.
[250:11.38]I don't know what's going on.
[250:12.12]I don't know why this is doing this.
[250:15.22]I have no idea, but I gotta move on.
[250:49.04]God damn it.
[250:50.10]Alright, I gotta pee.
[250:51.04]This is driving me nuts.
[250:52.77]I'll be right back.
[255:13.51]Hey.
[255:18.51]Alright.
[255:20.13]So what I'm going to do next, I'm going to put a cap on this one.
[255:27.63]When I just came back, I just saw this.
[255:31.29]I'm going to save this one because I want to try something.
[255:36.60]I want to try to mold my face.
[255:49.14]I just wanna see.
[255:59.54]I wanna just go make a guy and walk around the world.
[256:12.25]So pretty!
[256:18.80]Mold my butt first.
[256:20.49]I'm not going to mold my ass.
[256:26.95]Just drop a puppet in.
[256:29.31]Yeah, I wonder.
[256:30.13]Let me see.
[256:30.55]Let's go back to edit mode.
[256:36.86]Yeah, let's drop a puppet in.
[256:38.30]How do I do that?
[256:42.54]Is it under guides?
[256:43.99]Gadgets?
[256:45.57]Gadgets, right?
[256:48.65]Gameplay gear.
[256:51.29]And it is... One of these.
[256:53.94]Blank puppet, blank puppet, puppet.
[256:55.98]Yeah, one of these.
[257:02.13]Don't step on the ice.
[257:02.97]You can make, like, death zones, too.
[257:04.81]Alright, here we go.
[257:15.90]Well, the camera needs to be adjusted.
[257:18.20]He's going way too fast.
[257:23.71]There's no collision on those.
[257:25.23]How do I adjust the camera?
[257:35.43]Come on, go back to edit mode.
[257:36.29]I want to, like, pull the camera in.
[257:41.24]You have to be adjusted here.
[257:43.58]Turn speed, movement speed...
[257:47.21]It's way too fast.
[257:48.39]Run speed way too fast.
[257:52.54]Okay, jump height.
[257:55.60]I'm just realizing something right now.
[258:01.12]I think this is very small.
[258:05.18]This whole thing is only this big.
[258:11.89]It's tiny.
[258:15.70]It's very, very, very small.
[258:23.82]Oops.
[258:25.44]I can scale it all up, but I can scale everything down too.
[258:28.92]That's the next part, right?
[258:32.19]Okay, so now I want to upper body movement, behavior.
[258:39.73]Where's my camera?
[258:44.32]I know that it exists somewhere.
[258:50.35]I've not done any of this yet.
[258:56.63]Collision, labels, audio.
[259:00.79]Yeah, you can make it first person.
[259:02.15]It's just that I didn't do that.
[259:04.17]I don't even know if the tutorials exist to do that.
[259:09.93]That's something I would need to learn
[259:13.10]Kind of on my own time, I guess.
[259:16.20]Because I don't know if there's any camera options.
[259:21.36]But regardless, let's just, uh... Let's just stick around again.
[259:26.17]That guy's so weird.
[259:35.55]What about over here?
[259:36.17]Oh, it's over here!
[259:37.85]Nice trees!
[259:38.55]Who made these trees?
[259:39.67]These look pretty good!
[259:51.82]I don't think I can make the jump over here through the ice.
[259:53.70]Nope.
[260:03.88]Oops.
[260:04.04]Oh, there you go.
[260:12.39]This is the first actual real attempt I've really made.
[260:19.86]Yeah, I can make the... I can have collision under there.
[260:21.99]But this was not supposed to be a game.
[260:23.39]This was just me messing with the sculpting tool and moving stuff around and... Yeah.
[260:32.73]Now let's try something else.
[260:34.91]I want to save this, though.
[260:43.13]Me.
[260:47.75]Who cares?
[260:56.37]Okay.
[260:57.65]So this has been saved.
[260:58.85]Remix.
[261:02.76]Save it.
[261:03.24]It's saved.
[261:03.96]Exit creation.
[261:06.56]Okay.
[261:08.20]Let me try this.
[261:09.14]I wanna just do this.
[261:11.56]You can make, like, effects.
[261:13.60]Look at these sculptures and shit.
[261:15.12]I don't even know how the hell you would do that.
[261:20.39]Make a vehicle.
[261:23.49]Make a song.
[261:27.01]Alright, music timeline.
[261:32.47]It's got eight bars.
[261:33.51]Let's drag it out.
[261:36.92]Just go with like 16.
[261:38.26]Okay, now... I need search.
[261:49.20]Search for music clips.
[261:56.97]Animals.
[261:59.18]No results.
[262:03.08]Outer space.
[262:03.70]What do you mean no results?
[262:12.05]Collections.
[262:15.59]What are you talking about?
[262:24.74]So here's like Media Molecule's little collection of clips.
[262:33.00]Music tracks, music clips.
[262:34.88]Let's start here.
[262:39.55]Loops.
[262:40.77]Drums.
[262:46.07]Bass tracks.
[262:47.83]Chords.
[262:48.93]Rhythm section.
[262:51.21]Okay, let's do drums.
[263:03.25]Popsicle Breakbeat?
[263:09.58]Whatever this is has to be played the whole time I sculpt my face.
[263:15.73]I'm gonna try to do every detail.
[263:23.91]Popsicle?
[263:25.74]Okay, we'll do Popsicle.
[263:37.40]OK, let's add.
[263:42.76]Let's get back in here.
[263:43.66]Pull it back.
[263:53.07]Let's go to chords.
[264:03.82]Yeah, this really is just GarageBand.
[264:05.36]You can make your own stuff.
[264:06.95]I don't know how to do that yet though.
[264:35.33]Hey, this doesn't suck.
[264:36.38]Alright, let's change.
[264:43.88]Let's mess with this, though.
[264:46.27]So we got... Pitch.
[265:13.69]Well, I'm not adding this part.
[265:16.09]What is doing that?
[265:17.15]Alright.
[265:25.71]Well, that sounds alright.
[265:26.65]What else we got?
[265:37.36]Distant traffic?
[265:59.17]Okay, let's fade that out.
[266:07.92]Put in the Bohemian Rhapsody sample.
[266:09.90]This is the beginning.
[266:18.75]Bang!
[266:19.63]Right here.
[266:34.97]Lightning Strike.
[266:38.37]I need to go search by categories.
[266:41.37]Projectiles.
[266:46.41]Crossbow.
[266:50.26]Pew Blaster.
[266:53.34]We need special effects.
[267:00.32]Wait.
[267:07.87]You got it.
[267:18.78]And then, get the other one.
[267:27.15]Oh my god, that was fucking loud.
[267:29.73]Which one of these?
[267:30.23]This is the first explosion.
[267:31.39]I don't want this part.
[267:32.51]No, actually, yeah, I do.
[267:34.49]Just get in here.
[267:38.31]I just need one.
[267:39.17]That's just too loud.
[268:15.99]I don't know why that's so loud.
[268:22.56]Playback speed.
[268:26.74]Like, does it have to be that loud?
[268:32.46]And this is only gonna happen for like a second, right?
[268:40.01]Can I put the timeline here?
[268:41.37]Yeah.
[268:42.77]No, I wanna play from here.
[269:03.64]Now let's go back here.
[269:04.50]Can you do your own voice?
[269:06.88]Yes, you can.
[269:14.01]I need a heavy guitar.
[269:24.53]Go back to the main menu here.
[269:29.13]I need this most recent... No.
[269:32.81]Tags.
[269:35.09]Animals.
[269:36.81]Starting point.
[269:37.79]Phases and loops.
[269:39.57]Track.
[269:42.63]It just turns into Africa?
[269:47.13]No.
[269:50.42]I think this is kind of broken right now.
[269:57.38]Collections.
[270:05.09]Because if I go to all, I want to do categories.
[270:10.76]Category music.
[270:12.48]Tag.
[270:13.04]Tags A to Z. Blues, animals, classical.
[270:17.26]Classical.
[270:18.54]Okay.
[270:20.63]Dance, country.
[270:21.91]What is like rock?
[270:23.99]Heavy metal.
[270:25.47]There we go.
[270:30.93]Turn the game volume back up.
[270:31.97]Yeah, that's good.
[270:43.78]I actually, I like it.
[270:48.04]So let's see.
[270:51.46]Well, I don't know why it has to be that loud.
[271:15.21]No, no, no, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[271:22.76]What does this sound like?
[271:23.56]I want to play it from here.
[271:57.66]The dial tone.
[271:59.12]I don't know.
[271:59.48]I'm just putting stuff in just to see.
[272:01.04]I haven't played with this yet.
[272:02.44]This is the perfect theme song for Jerma Popsicle.
[272:32.03]Uh, I don't want this to go all the way.
[272:41.65]These really aren't supposed to be, unless you have a real idea where you're gonna make your own song.
[272:47.18]I don't know if more than 16 bars, 24 bars of a loop is a good idea.
[273:17.44]You really need to come in and make your own stuff.
[273:20.04]But I don't really know how to do that yet.
[273:24.00]I know how to play around with the timeline, but nothing else.
[273:34.97]Alright, let's sculpt my face.
[273:36.85]I'm not going to do music.
[273:38.49]It'll take all day.
[273:39.61]And I don't know how to do it, so we're not going to do it.
[273:47.86]So, here's what we're going to do.
[273:53.12]That sounds like 2013 GarageBand.
[273:54.52]Yeah, it's probably very similar.
[273:58.38]We're just going to put on something easy.
[274:10.75]There, there you go.
[274:17.13]So I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[274:18.57]Let's see if I can do it.
[274:26.46]I'm going to try to sculpt my face.
[274:29.48]At least the front part.
[274:33.36]I'm not going to put the explosion on loop.
[274:39.00]I don't even know what camera this is.
[274:42.02]Is this the right camera?
[274:45.99]find out it is so I'm gonna just take a screenshot of my face and I'm gonna try to get it correct so there we go
[275:15.99]Let me change this.
[275:22.43]And it should show up now.
[275:28.26]Just want a little screenshot.
[275:30.26]Yeah, we'll do the beard, too.
[275:37.12]OK, ready?
[276:00.72]I can't take it.
[276:01.28]How am I supposed to take it?
[276:02.08]Okay.
[276:05.82]Ready?
[276:06.90]I got an idea.
[276:16.49]Okay.
[276:18.07]Got the screenshot.
[276:20.31]Get a profile shot too.
[276:26.28]Hold on.
[276:26.82]Hold on.
[276:28.14]I can't do all that at once.
[276:36.37]Is it out of sync?
[276:37.33]Hold on.
[276:38.95]Let me get the first screenshot.
[276:51.27]I gotta do this first.
[276:52.53]It's gonna be so much easier if I get my other monitor back.
[277:04.59]Oh my god, you piece of shit.
[277:11.82]Don't ever buy a monitor that has a fucking touchpad on the right.
[277:15.22]It's a piece of crap.
[277:17.30]Like, it's a piece of total crap.
[277:23.88]Alright, there's, uh... I feel like I don't even look like a real person.
[277:35.35]Alright, hold on.
[277:54.61]Save that.
[278:07.45]Oh my god, I hate computers more than anything.
[278:17.78]Save that.
[278:18.36]Okay.
[278:28.82]I bet you I could probably get it pretty close.
[278:36.78]And then this side too.
[278:40.98]I need to bring this over here.
[278:43.32]OK.
[279:13.01]okay I got it wait what why is it a different image it's taking a screenshot of every of all three of my monitors oh my god
[279:48.89]Hurry the fuck up!
[279:53.25]What are you doing?!
[279:54.25]I hate computers.
[279:58.42]I can't wait till we go back to fucking newspapers, I swear to god.
[280:04.60]Alright, I'm go- I'm gone.
[280:06.50]I'll be back.
[280:10.64]I gotta add the zits too, there's like two zits.
[280:15.00]Alright, let's get him on screen.
[280:35.36]It's like lit up better.
[280:48.68]Okay.
[280:49.72]So that's what I'm going for.
[280:53.24]I need these references like on my screen.
[280:55.34]I'm going to put it down here.
[281:07.22]That's for you.
[281:15.58]It's your super face cam.
[281:30.03]Make them kiss.
[281:33.63]So now I also bear with me here.
[281:41.07]Those are three different people.
[281:46.43]They are not, I can assure you.
[281:47.89]Alright.
[281:57.17]Now I get them over here.
[281:58.25]Alright, here we go.
[282:02.51]Let's see how close I can get this.
[282:08.32]I'll spend four hours on this.
[282:10.04]I could care less.
[282:16.84]Alright, time to begin.
[282:19.14]So we're gonna start with, um, we're gonna go with the front.
[282:37.52]Okay.
[282:39.16]So.
[282:40.98]We have to go with the circle.
[282:43.20]Or maybe like the cone.
[282:49.23]It's probably cone.
[283:15.40]No.
[283:15.90]No.
[283:17.22]No.
[283:18.12]No.
[283:19.73]Nope.
[283:24.01]Alright, so let's start with the forehead.
[283:33.62]And then it comes down here.
[283:34.91]I just need like a base.
[284:01.36]I don't think I can fucking do this.
[284:04.11]I need like a base first.
[284:11.73]To do this correctly, it's gonna take like 50 hours.
[284:20.07]This is like an actual art project.
[284:32.88]There you go.
[284:33.50]Done.
[284:34.76]It's... Who is that?
[284:36.82]No, no.
[284:37.30]What character is this?
[284:39.36]It's a cookie character or something.
[284:40.78]What's the character?
[284:41.86]There's his mouth right there.
[284:43.00]This is eyes.
[284:43.83]Who is this?
[284:46.27]Oh my god.
[284:46.73]It's like a fucking cereal character.
[285:01.07]Okay.
[285:05.19]Let's take this and then let's shave off.
[285:12.37]Let's get in there.
[285:19.65]What are you doing?
[285:23.03]What?
[285:24.36]That was weird.
[285:27.36]Why does it look so weird here?
[285:33.07]Alright, let me see what we got.
[285:34.25]Does this part stays up a little?
[285:44.75]Is that the mouth?
[285:59.82]No, no, this is like the side of the head.
[286:05.30]This is not the nose.
[286:13.33]I just need to get the general shape.
[286:29.08]Let me just get off the edges here.
[286:35.34]I think I may have made it too big.
[286:38.14]Oh my god, these controls are killing me.
[286:54.80]This way.
[287:11.46]This comes in like this.
[287:29.01]Circle's not gonna work?
[287:29.99]Um... It's alright.
[287:33.59]It's... I'm doing it.
[287:35.29]I've already started.
[287:36.09]I don't know.
[287:36.35]There's no going back now.
[287:43.54]the side oh my god this is gonna take forever this is gonna actually take forever where I know I can do this where's mirror okay there it is
[288:11.11]I believe I can do it on both sides.
[288:13.35]There we go.
[288:13.93]Okay.
[288:16.85]Zoom out.
[288:34.40]It's getting there.
[288:51.66]I wish I could just see it all.
[288:54.60]I don't want to like have an axis of it.
[288:56.84]I want to like see it the whole thing and be able to do it and not have to move the fucking camera around.
[289:01.82]I want to stay... I want to stay... here.
[289:09.42]I don't want to move in.
[289:13.56]That's like the biggest gripe I have with the game.
[289:19.22]I would love to just lock the camera here and be able to move around and sculpt from here.
[289:23.60]No, I have to move forward.
[289:33.87]I can't lock the camera.
[289:42.55]I don't think there was anything in the tutorials talking about to lock the camera in place.
[289:50.52]Well, let's just keep going like this.
[289:56.76]Just do it in Blender, it's free.
[290:00.22]It probably would be easier to do this in Blender.
[290:06.88]Yeah, look, I know I can hold R1 and rotate all over the place, but I can't paint like this.
[290:13.44]I can't do anything.
[290:18.55]I have to move forward.
[290:21.07]It's just really odd.
[290:25.30]The fact that the camera moves with you while you move to sculpt is just very, very odd that they would do that.
[290:34.48]But it doesn't move backwards.
[290:35.36]Alright, we're getting there.
[290:44.82]These are correct.
[291:17.03]I just want to lock the camera.
[291:18.15]That's all I want to do.
[291:19.53]Okay.
[291:36.28]I almost got the initial shape.
[291:52.43]This has got to go back here, though.
[292:05.85]I'm just turning it into a bike helmet.
[292:19.78]Okay, so... Let me go up.
[292:27.08]No, no, not up.
[292:28.54]I need to keep these here.
[292:35.44]This has to be changed, though.
[292:36.62]I need to go... Let's go square.
[292:38.30]No, no, no.
[292:43.87]Back here.
[292:57.04]Streamer, don't do it wrong?
[292:59.14]What do you mean, don't do it wrong?
[293:10.63]This is immensely difficult to control.
[293:13.94]Dude, you know what?
[293:19.98]Does it really have to be motion controlled?
[293:23.00]I heard somebody say that they were making a non-motion controlled part of the game.
[293:29.49]Like, can I just turn this off?
[293:31.31]I don't want this.
[293:46.26]I don't want this.
[293:48.57]They're adding control methods.
[293:50.21]Thank God.
[293:50.81]He's sculpting General Grievous.
[293:55.70]It's just hard to get anything.
[293:56.84]I'm just...
[294:28.23]I'm almost ready to start doing details.
[294:51.04]Look at the side of my face.
[294:52.72]How am I ever going to fix this?
[294:57.74]like a fucking imbecile.
[295:01.67]I'm gonna look like an alien race.
[295:33.85]That's close enough.
[295:45.32]Let's see with the front.
[295:46.26]All I care about is the front and the sides.
[295:53.55]Take this in.
[296:02.26]No, I don't have... This is like turkey neck.
[296:14.90]Okay.
[296:16.64]Alright.
[296:17.72]I'm ready to start doing... Get rid of the mirror.
[296:20.60]Alright.
[296:27.25]What does my face look like?
[296:28.51]Let's see.
[296:29.87]I'm gonna start bottom to top.
[296:37.39]Let's see.
[296:37.93]I need the cylinder.
[296:38.97]I have it on.
[296:42.83]Okay, here we go.
[296:43.53]I need to do surface mode.
[296:50.11]And blending.
[296:52.99]Right?
[296:56.75]Oh, it's no, no, no, no.
[296:57.71]Not blending.
[297:02.52]So this, my nose, where's my mouth?
[297:13.94]It starts like this.
[298:05.65]I need to go... Alright, so then what's the measurement from here?
[298:10.49]It's like up here, and then this is where the nose starts.
[298:16.32]Right there.
[298:16.94]Like right here, actually.
[298:32.80]And then...
[298:34.78]It's still a little bit like a bulb, but this way.
[298:37.34]It gets a little thicker up here.
[299:04.18]It's like two people playing volleyball.
[299:47.91]I need to get it right from this side.
[299:49.71]This is so fucked up.
[299:54.05]This is not even close.
[299:55.49]It looks like somebody took their hand and smashed it into my face.
[300:02.54]They just bombed me straight ahead and squished
[300:15.68]Man, no fucking way.
[300:26.61]It gets wider here.
[300:32.77]Like this.
[300:33.41]Okay, now let me look over here.
[300:43.28]It's kind of flat right here.
[300:56.41]no this is like just growths all over my nose okay eyes but hold on I have some like dips here no that's not gonna happen
[301:28.99]Let me see what the eyes look like.
[301:34.62]They go... How close are they?
[301:38.24]This one's kind of close to my nose.
[301:46.35]This one's a little further away.
[301:48.13]Like this.
[302:04.98]OK.
[302:11.87]And then I have kind of a big brow bone that sticks out like this.
[303:00.58]I'll get this end here.
[303:01.68]And then it kind of comes down like this, but they don't connect.
[303:06.33]And then up on the forehead.
[303:14.01]My forehead's a little longer than this.
[303:17.53]I can't add to it, though.
[303:34.99]Let me check over here.
[303:35.97]I need to go like this.
[303:45.08]Back this up.
[303:47.11]Let's take all this out.
[303:48.27]It doesn't need to be here.
[304:03.61]Oh god.
[304:05.83]Don't cut the whole thing off.
[304:09.35]Alright.
[304:10.13]I have to add the hair, so don't worry.
[304:21.44]I'm just like a moon face.
[304:30.15]Oh well.
[304:54.13]Alright, getting better.
[304:54.99]Is my internet dying?
[305:00.54]My internet's going fucking crazy, huh?
[305:09.68]New emote?
[305:10.24]Not yet.
[305:10.65]Am I gonna stream here, or what's going on?
[305:13.87]It dropped like 15,000 frames.
[305:22.45]What the fuck is going on?
[305:31.87]Let's shave this part off.
[305:49.74]I can cover this with hair, so I'm not concerned about that.
[305:52.10]The question is, is this correct?
[305:58.17]Not really.
[306:01.38]No.
[306:07.62]Goddamn camera.
[306:08.74]Alright, let me go in here.
[306:27.01]The mouth is wrong.
[306:33.73]I have to try to fix this.
[306:49.30]I have a big bottom lip.
[307:17.68]Somebody put some indents on my face.
[307:20.80]Let me just patch those up real quick.
[307:33.10]The nose is way too far away from my mouth.
[307:36.69]And the eyes are not correct, but I think we can move on.
[307:46.46]need to the nostrils are there I need to go back here and no alright I need to do paint go to tint that's cut that is kind of the my skin right now I don't think I need to change that
[308:20.13]Just spray paint?
[308:20.89]No, no, no.
[308:21.33]It's got to be... Well, let's go to the paint tool.
[308:31.40]And let's grab this one.
[308:35.74]How does that look?
[308:37.18]No, it needs to be the veiny one.
[308:44.08]Even worse than that.
[308:46.07]Worse than that.
[308:51.67]What's my beard look like?
[308:52.61]It's really stringy and terrible.
[309:00.85]No, not like that.
[309:03.97]I'll probably just go with veins and then the color is dark brown.
[309:08.66]Okay, let's map that.
[310:13.58]It's like that.
[310:15.62]No, it's not.
[310:19.87]This is not like glued on hair.
[310:41.56]Wait, what happened here?
[310:59.31]Oh, shit, I need side... No, no, no, not yet, not yet.
[311:14.36]This does look like my beard.
[311:15.76]It looks terrible.
[311:19.82]Okay.
[311:25.01]And you didn't think that looked like my beard?
[311:28.11]Come on, now.
[311:43.86]Cox is trying to kill the stream.
[311:47.92]Yeah, they do that, don't they?
[311:49.66]Alright, no.
[311:58.55]Let's put the eyes in.
[311:59.65]I can do the hair, too.
[312:07.64]Paint.
[312:09.04]Hair, I'm gonna say, would be...
[312:12.81]I know how it looks.
[312:15.49]Probably expressive.
[312:18.29]Yeah, it's definitely going to be expressive.
[312:20.17]Same color, too.
[312:20.78]Okay, so this swoops down.
[312:48.43]goes around here.
[313:07.22]What's happening?
[313:07.80]What do you mean?
[313:12.44]My hairline's not higher than this.
[313:13.86]What are you talking about?
[313:14.79]It's already awful.
[313:17.79]It's already so bad.
[313:18.97]Friar Tuck.
[313:36.22]Hold on.
[313:54.56]You look like a stooge.
[314:00.00]Just let me get it all on there before anybody makes fun of me.
[314:05.26]I'm going to comb it.
[314:13.51]I just have to comb it first.
[314:23.96]Which side does it go down?
[314:25.20]Not that one.
[314:26.04]This one.
[315:00.20]Alright.
[315:35.42]I'm going to try to comb this, and then we'll see what happens.
[315:44.80]You're looking low-key cute in this image here.
[315:47.38]Oh, thanks.
[315:47.96]I appreciate that.
[315:48.68]OK.
[316:10.48]I don't think this is going to work.
[316:14.38]I may have given up.
[316:15.34]I may have given up a little.
[316:20.00]Not completely.
[316:21.04]100%.
[316:21.06]Although blurry, squint your eyes a little.
[316:33.65]I'm going to finish it.
[316:34.87]Don't worry.
[316:38.67]I came this far.
[316:39.53]You think I was not going to finish?
[316:41.77]I'm going to turn into a Final Fantasy character.
[317:03.89]What's with the hair not being over here?
[317:05.63]Oh my god!
[317:10.22]And why does my internet suck?
[317:31.68]Okay, almost done with this part.
[317:38.58]This needs to be fixed over here.
[317:39.87]I just need a little more going this way.
[317:44.96]It's very flat.
[317:45.98]My hair's not that flat.
[318:12.07]It does look like a wig.
[318:13.11]Alright, I need... No, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[318:30.58]I need to put my eyes in there.
[318:35.20]And then I'll do some more detail.
[318:40.43]I need the... No, I need the spray paint tool.
[318:47.03]Paint.
[318:48.55]I'm gonna go white.
[318:51.89]And spray paint.
[319:17.12]This no-joke looks like a skinny version of my dad's face.
[319:27.69]Does it?
[319:28.09]Alright, well, okay, I got... I'm gonna do one circle of black.
[319:41.72]Which, it's like here.
[319:50.12]No, no, I need blue.
[319:51.74]Blue first.
[319:55.16]What kind of blue is it?
[319:56.64]It's like a slate blue.
[319:59.29]It's like this.
[320:04.59]Thank you, I'll take it.
[320:05.49]Yes.
[320:08.41]Yes, I would love to paint with this, please.
[320:38.43]It doesn't help.
[320:39.21]Don't worry, we're gonna do terrifying nightmare face, Jeremy.
[321:12.63]Red.
[321:12.89]What kind of red?
[321:18.11]It's not that red.
[321:26.36]It's not that red either!
[321:27.62]This is very very very bad.
[321:37.86]It's okay.
[321:38.52]It's like this.
[321:42.30]There we go, that's better.
[321:59.23]This just needs to be sculpted.
[322:04.91]By somebody that knows what they're doing, not me.
[322:15.30]alright that was I don't know why this hair looks so strange god damn it no no I don't want paint
[322:50.20]This just doesn't look right.
[322:51.82]It just doesn't look right.
[322:56.89]No!
[322:57.87]Oops.
[322:59.70]Somehow that looks better.
[323:00.62]No, I forgot the eyebrows.
[323:04.58]You're right.
[323:04.90]But this needs to be...
[323:29.13]I just look like Tom Green.
[323:39.00]Maybe it's... Maybe let me paint the... Let me get the eyebrows painted on.
[323:41.46]And then... I don't know what the fuck else to do about this.
[324:02.18]Let's try eyebrows and see if that helps.
[324:33.62]Kind of helps a little.
[324:43.02]My face is too rounded over here.
[324:59.59]See, that could be me.
[325:10.78]I'm going to do... Yeah, the hair is too fucking stupid looking.
[325:27.45]Okay.
[325:31.03]The hair is wrong by a little bit.
[325:32.35]Let me try to fix that.
[325:42.71]Alright, so here, get your screenshot now, because I'm going to try to fix it.
[325:55.43]OK.
[326:25.54]Makes you a little stranger.
[326:28.93]Whatever doesn't kill you.
[326:29.95]I went a little too far.
[327:22.75]Nightmarish?
[327:23.67]You ain't seen nothing yet.
[327:40.84]Which color is it?
[327:41.48]This one?
[327:42.80]No.
[327:43.20]What's the regular, just standard, just default one?
[328:02.54]How do I just get default color?
[328:11.53]Oh, whatever.
[328:14.91]Save this one.
[328:23.37]There is a color.
[328:23.93]This is like the color picker, but I don't understand how this works.
[328:28.00]Like pure and then mixed, I don't...
[328:31.98]I don't understand how this is.
[328:33.24]Custom picker, right?
[328:36.33]And then pick a shade, okay?
[328:39.33]But it's not doing it.
[328:40.13]And then it's like, whoa, this is save color.
[328:42.33]It's confusing.
[328:50.57]It's like the eyedrop tool in a way, I guess.
[329:18.03]No, that's not going to work.
[329:18.91]It needs to be bigger.
[329:30.88]Come on now.
[329:34.92]Come on.
[329:36.74]What are you waiting for?
[329:42.15]Come on.
[329:42.47]I'm trying to do like a jawbreaker.
[329:44.01]Like I'm chewing on a big bubble gum thing.
[330:02.25]It has to be on the other side, too.
[330:03.87]Because I'm, like, crunching on this side.
[330:11.89]A little too much.
[330:25.82]Do you have to be like this, game?
[330:28.49]Do you have to be like this?
[330:29.89]What's going on?
[330:31.87]What's the problem?
[330:34.33]There's no problem.
[330:35.11]Stop snapping.
[330:36.41]Don't be like this.
[330:37.11]I need like a wincing face too.
[330:57.76]No, I should be blowing like a bubble?
[331:15.82]Oops, not that deep Pull it forward a little
[332:05.10]Jesus.
[332:20.71]Pretty good.
[332:21.19]I'm going to turn the nose a little bit.
[332:36.11]Should be pulled up a little on this side.
[332:37.97]You have to animate this?
[333:00.60]I don't even know how to do that.
[333:11.68]Turn this down.
[333:14.78]These eyes have to close a little, like this.
[333:32.52]It just looks like somebody beat him up.
[333:41.47]These brows need to change a little.
[333:44.57]Oops.
[333:59.46]Like that.
[334:00.12]Alright.
[334:13.92]The nose needs to connect to the eyebrows, does it though?
[334:16.94]No, he's eating the big candy.
[334:23.59]Alright, now I'm going to make my body.
[334:28.35]What do I have on?
[334:33.43]Blue shirt?
[334:36.44]Boogers all over the nose.
[334:52.96]OK.
[335:42.66]Not bad.
[335:49.81]No, that's about an earthworm.
[335:51.11]A little lower.
[336:16.83]Looks alright.
[336:29.35]Okay.
[336:34.39]And let's do some work over here.
[337:20.34]Don't give it arms?
[337:21.20]Why not?
[337:21.66]OK.
[337:33.91]Let's group these together.
[337:38.04]Are they already grouped?
[337:50.33]Are they grouped already?
[337:51.55]Oh, they are.
[337:52.04]OK.
[338:29.09]I need to do it a little differently though.
[338:59.69]Why is everybody so horrified?
[339:01.33]I can't make a fucking monster?
[339:14.97]Turn Snap back on.
[339:16.11]Yeah, that's actually a good idea.
[339:23.52]Let's get down in here.
[339:30.48]Oh, no, never mind.
[339:31.18]I'll just copy.
[339:38.19]Oh my god.
[339:38.81]I hate that so much.
[340:16.04]Oops.
[340:18.97]Stand back.
[340:19.59]I'm gonna vomit.
[340:26.69]Alright, fine.
[340:28.06]I'll conclude it here.
[340:32.06]But not yet.
[341:14.34]I have to put a blue shirt on him.
[341:16.10]And I have to put him on, like, a stone pedestal.
[341:22.40]Oh, fuck.
[341:24.37]It's okay.
[341:25.87]I never group these together.
[341:32.07]Oops-a-daisy.
[341:48.42]Looks alright.
[341:52.80]Oh, didn't group those together either.
[342:01.00]Why are you going so slow?
[342:03.12]No, deselect.
[342:23.41]Am I selecting the beer, too?
[342:25.21]I hope so.
[342:35.30]No.
[342:40.40]Okay.
[342:41.04]One.
[342:41.58]Two.
[342:43.02]Three.
[342:44.60]Four.
[342:45.34]What?
[342:45.56]Oh my god, this game's gonna make me puke.
[342:55.66]Okay.
[342:56.74]Grab.
[342:58.10]Two.
[342:59.78]Three.
[343:00.90]Group them.
[343:02.92]Oh my god.
[343:15.74]Why are you doing this?
[343:20.75]What are you doing?
[343:24.07]No, now I have to ungroup this shit.
[343:40.32]I... I'm about to fucking exit the game.
[343:46.62]The- this- I'm just trying to group these together!
[343:51.19]Wha- I undid it already!
[343:57.12]Oh my god!
[343:58.14]Okay, that's better.
[344:19.14]I'm not sure this is attached.
[344:33.66]No, it is.
[344:35.84]Alright, now for the final finishing touches.
[344:37.88]I need to put a little t-shirt on him.
[344:40.60]And then turn this into stone.
[344:45.35]Mad because bad.
[344:46.35]Mad because bad.
[344:48.03]No, it takes a lot of fucking work to figure this shit out.
[344:56.22]Even still, I still don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[344:59.28]Alright, let's do this.
[345:06.29]And then, I wanna make this stone... I'm gonna make him shiny.
[345:18.66]Let's go with a... shiny.
[345:23.00]See what this looks like.
[345:32.43]Perfect, nice and sweaty.
[345:48.71]No, it looks like he made it out of glass.
[345:54.81]Okay.
[345:58.18]Now, the color is fine.
[346:00.68]Although I do need to change the color of this, because I just want this to be stone.
[346:06.22]Yeah, just like a little place to show off.
[346:09.32]Maybe a little bit darker.
[346:10.74]There we go, that's better.
[346:12.24]Okay.
[346:14.72]Make him have glowing red eyes.
[346:24.65]I don't even know if I can do that.
[346:27.95]Hold on.
[346:41.97]Oh, I can definitely do that.
[346:44.69]Glowing red?
[346:45.31]You got it.
[346:45.75]I still have to put a t-shirt on him.
[346:59.95]Okay, let's make these glow red.
[347:04.29]I want these things to move around too.
[347:13.80]Are they moving?
[347:40.59]I don't think so.
[347:42.73]He's wet.
[347:43.52]I'm going to put rain in.
[347:44.92]Thanks for telling me.
[348:06.11]And I need glow.
[348:09.23]Where is it?
[348:10.03]Is it under style?
[348:10.91]Yeah.
[348:11.47]No, it's not.
[348:12.05]Where is it?
[348:14.60]Glow?
[348:14.96]Right here.
[348:15.58]Glow.
[348:17.90]Now, I want this to be red.
[348:20.28]Like this.
[348:30.27]And then glow.
[348:32.15]Glow.
[348:40.95]It works.
[348:42.46]That's got a lot of glow.
[348:54.89]I don't think it works.
[348:56.45]How about blue?
[348:57.21]Because my eyes are blue.
[349:11.70]Why is it still red?
[349:12.42]Oh, whatever.
[349:16.08]Alright.
[349:25.58]Rain.
[349:30.59]So we need paint.
[349:32.69]I gotta go over here.
[349:35.09]We gotta do the ruler.
[349:38.24]We're gonna put, like, fucking lightning and shit in the background.
[349:41.64]I have to add a penis.
[349:42.90]No, I don't.
[349:43.68]I don't have to do that, actually.
[349:47.09]I'm gonna do straight line, right?
[349:49.71]Straight.
[349:51.53]Make it blue.
[349:52.13]Okay.
[349:56.71]Okay.
[350:10.44]Now I should be able to... Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
[350:17.18]Hey, hey, hey!
[350:18.88]Where's the other one?
[350:23.04]Where's the other one?
[350:24.44]Oh, just blend in.
[350:30.66]Alright, now I should be able to open up this menu.
[350:36.35]And we're going to go to Animation, Playback Settings.
[350:40.68]There we go.
[350:42.50]Trail length.
[350:43.24]OK.
[350:51.01]That's taking a long time to fall.
[351:01.09]Not the best rain I've ever made.
[351:12.69]Zoom it out.
[351:16.83]I think I made them too big.
[351:27.08]Animate in sequence.
[351:28.75]Pulse.
[351:55.59]Spread, there we go.
[351:59.03]Jitter, there we go.
[352:04.46]It needs to be better looking, though.
[352:06.10]It looks weird.
[352:12.84]Move this out of the way.
[352:33.77]I wonder how... I need this to go faster.
[352:41.16]There we go, okay.
[352:47.86]No, not really.
[352:58.79]I thought I had it.
[353:18.64]Because these need to be spread out a little bit more.
[353:20.88]Maybe effects?
[353:27.15]Oil?
[353:28.83]No.
[353:30.71]Evaporate.
[353:31.85]Ooh!
[353:32.27]Okay, there we are.
[353:34.19]That's how we get droplets.
[353:40.03]And throb, maybe?
[353:41.11]They're just in weird places.
[353:57.25]Maximum throb.
[353:58.39]Let me go down here and look up.
[354:07.48]Yeah, I'm close.
[354:10.00]I'm really close.
[354:11.02]I'm just not quite there.
[354:15.15]Almost there, but not quite.
[354:37.98]How are you talking without moving your mouth?
[354:44.19]It's like ice.
[354:44.73]Maybe you need to shrink it.
[354:52.87]Drop the opacity too.
[354:53.89]Hey, look at that.
[354:54.97]It looks a little better.
[355:06.17]Turn it down, turn it down, turn it down, turn it down, turn it down, turn it down!
[355:09.33]Oh, God!
[355:11.36]I can't turn it down!
[355:12.32]Alright, that's fine.
[355:19.04]Alright, that's good enough.
[355:24.44]Now we just need some scary sounds.
[355:33.39]Sounds like a windstorm.
[355:37.07]Ooh.
[355:48.75]I actually like that.
[355:57.18]That really does look like a windstorm.
[356:14.59]Alright.
[356:16.93]You guys remember?
[356:19.18]I'm going to take these off now.
[356:25.20]Kim just brought up this.
[356:31.38]Look at this.
[356:33.38]I feel like I'm having like dreams again of this saying that this is like the same amazing dinner.
[356:40.40]Is it the same day?
[356:41.36]This is fucking awesome.
[356:45.32]She just made it apparently.
[356:50.63]Uh, I like it the way it is.
[356:52.35]I like it like that.
[356:55.65]I am going to put on some song here, some music.
[357:05.27]No, I don't want to sound gadgets.
[357:06.41]I just want, like, rain and thunder.
[357:08.77]And scary music.
[357:15.77]Uh, then right here.
[357:17.97]Oh my god.
[357:19.85]Alright, rain!
[357:25.18]There we go.
[357:29.34]Uh, this means this is the field where you hear it.
[357:33.22]But you'll hear it the whole time anyways.
[357:37.30]Now I need, like, lightning strikes.
[357:49.95]I like that, too.
[357:50.51]Alright, now I need scary music.
[358:02.36]Okay.
[358:07.09]See you guys.
[360:11.07]Oh, I couldn't go in fast enough.
[360:12.85]Really.
[360:13.09]I was trying to go in really fast to his face.
[360:21.64]Alright, I think that's gonna be it for dreams for now.
[360:29.78]Unless, does anybody, did anybody make something?
[360:34.55]Did anybody make something?
[360:48.17]I can hear that from my kitchen.
[360:50.61]Let me check again.
[360:57.88]Well, I'm gonna save this as... Ah, fuck if I know.
[361:09.60]My creation three.
[361:21.57]Imagine coming across with that thumbnail.
[361:27.35]Okay.
[361:28.41]Here's what I made today.
[361:31.78]Those of you that didn't see this before, I will show it to you.
[361:45.92]It's the ice cream.
[361:52.01]It's so fucking funny, I can't believe that.
[361:54.07]I forgot about that too.
[361:58.41]jermaPopsicle.
[361:59.61]Or jermaPop.
[362:02.31]That's probably what that'll be.
[362:09.13]I love how I just made a better version of this today.
[362:12.72]You know how we talk about progress?
[362:15.12]Alright, look at this.
[362:16.48]Take a look at that thing.
[362:19.58]And then you tell me that I didn't make progress today.
[362:28.22]Okay.
[362:29.76]You don't think I made progress today?
[362:47.48]And then, what was the other one I did?
[362:48.98]I spent like three and a half hours on that other thing.
[362:51.10]I don't even remember this one.
[362:59.22]Oh god.
[363:14.23]Oh yeah, now I remember.
[363:19.76]I wanted to fix this.
[363:29.78]King of the Monsters.
[363:37.18]Well, there you go.
[363:41.76]Those are my three dreams that I was able to come out of my head in the last 12 hours.
[363:48.72]And I'll tell you my final assessment of the game so far.
[363:51.02]Well, final as of today.
[363:56.20]And we dropped a lot of frames too.
[363:58.59]I think this game is really, really good.
[364:00.97]It's really awesome.
[364:03.15]I love the idea.
[364:06.87]I just want... I want some different control schemes.
[364:12.95]Because I would almost much rather the camera be the gyroscope.
[364:18.52]Like, I can tilt the camera around and have it set to sensitivity and use the sticks to move all the stuff around?
[364:28.46]I don't know how true this is, but somebody was mentioning that a mouse and keyboard, right?
[364:35.59]Does that work?
[364:42.82]That sounds worse.
[364:43.58]I really just don't.
[364:44.22]It's hard to make a game like this on console that has this much detail.
[364:56.10]And the journey so far, depending on how... I know a lot of people were saying earlier in the stream, and I kind of lashed back about how, I don't know, this is a boring stream or whatever, but this is really the time that I have to do it.
[365:12.84]You know what I'm saying?
[365:17.65]And sure, I could turn the stream off right now and go play it again.
[365:21.31]But... You know, there's other things that I have to do.
[365:26.05]And speaking of other things... Hold on.
[365:35.42]Just trying one of those tomatoes.
[365:38.10]I gotta get this off the screen, so...
[365:41.98]Okay, there we go.
[365:45.82]Not every stream has to be like 100 miles per hour.
[365:48.19]Yeah, I know, and it's... And I'm honestly just trying to learn a new game.
[365:52.27]I mean, you can't be... You can't know everything and... No, every single thing works in the first 10 to 12 hours of a game that's designed to put hundreds...
[366:07.23]But I know that people want to see more high-octane kind of stuff on the stream.
[366:12.66]But... I don't really have any other option than to stream it.
[366:16.90]Because if I don't stream this game... For instance, like, tomorrow and Friday, right?
[366:22.13]I'm not playing Dreams.
[366:25.43]I'm not learning more things tomorrow.
[366:33.72]But it's all good.
[366:38.50]Surf some more?
[366:41.87]Yeah, we'll, um, we will do this all tomorrow.
[366:47.27]Tomorrow.
[366:53.50]Well, I'm not, I'm not, no, the stream's not over yet.
[366:55.02]Because I do want to search for, uh, to see if anybody made any Jerma-related stuff.
[367:00.16]J-E-R-M-A.
[367:03.39]But tomorrow's gonna be, um, the start time's gonna be different.
[367:10.13]Let me see.
[367:10.71]Depending on when I get up tomorrow, I might go early, like really early.
[367:15.56]Let me see.
[367:17.68]It's either going to be really early or a little bit later.
[367:19.56]Alright.
[367:29.60]Looks like we're going to be an early boy tomorrow.
[367:36.59]And when I say early boy, I mean early.
[367:43.89]This is an EU-friendly stream tomorrow.
[367:51.46]I'm probably going to... Because Otto has an appointment at the vet at 5pm Pacific.
[367:59.08]So I'm going to try to start the stream tomorrow somewhere around like 11 or 12.
[368:03.44]Stream for about 5 or 6 hours.
[368:09.36]So you're going to get a really early one tomorrow.
[368:12.84]No, he's fine.
[368:13.40]He's fine.
[368:14.08]He's good.
[368:15.18]He just needs to go get a shot.
[368:16.64]He gets a shot every three to four weeks because he has Addison's disease.
[368:20.14]11 or 12 Pacific or Eastern Pacific.
[368:29.23]So somewhere around like three, three ish p.m.
[368:33.03]Eastern is when the stream is going to start tomorrow.
[368:37.82]He has Addison's disease.
[368:43.10]What am I going to stream?
[368:43.82]That's a good question.
[368:45.52]I really don't know.
[368:50.51]There's a couple of options.
[368:52.93]But I really... I don't know.
[369:02.11]More dreams?
[369:04.04]Maybe.
[369:06.72]Maybe.
[369:08.58]Maybe make a game next time.
[369:10.68]Like a little platformer.
[369:11.58]I don't know.
[369:18.41]Jet Island.
[369:19.43]My VR is all packed up right now.
[369:26.03]I don't know.
[369:26.77]I'll figure it out.
[369:28.71]If it's not Dreams Part 2 or Part 3, then it'll be something else.
[369:39.86]With that, I am going to switch back to the game.
[369:43.06]And we're going to look to see if anybody has anything.
[369:47.11]Browse all.
[369:49.07]And I believe, do I have all this stuff?
[369:52.60]No, no, no, I want to just get these off.
[369:58.40]Or should I leave them on?
[370:00.92]Should I leave them on?
[370:05.41]People are probably coming to this room just being like, what the fuck is this dude doing?
[370:08.41]I need to, Jerma.
[370:13.19]Jerma.
[370:15.58]Bring it back, oops.
[370:20.39]J-E-R-M-A.
[370:27.21]Oh, wait a minute.
[370:30.76]We got a couple.
[370:37.80]Look at that.
[370:41.10]This is Jerma Test.
[370:42.72]Let's try this one.
[370:47.93]Uh.
[370:49.83]Ugh.
[371:04.42]I'm just, what's with, what is up with my face?
[371:08.07]I'm just in a constant, permanent dab.
[371:12.55]That's a pretty nice Bob, too.
[371:13.89]Alright, hold on, I wanna get like a close look at this.
[371:22.80]Look at that face.
[371:27.12]I'm skipping with one foot.
[371:33.39]Yeah, my right leg's really bothering me lately.
[371:37.72]That's fucking hilarious.
[371:38.72]Alright, let's go back.
[371:40.12]Lums that one up.
[371:44.88]And this is Jerma-Joop.
[371:48.46]Jerma-Jupiter.
[371:49.06]I think it's just a painting, a little sculpture.
[371:53.02]Yep.
[371:56.52]Okay.
[371:57.52]Yep.
[371:59.72]And it has an ass.
[372:00.81]Of course it does.
[372:03.39]Why wouldn't it have butt cheeks?
[372:11.97]What's the other one?
[372:12.55]We got jermaOld.
[372:14.75]jermaOld and jermaOld.
[372:16.47]This is a game.
[372:38.82]After streaming for 75 years, FTierBoomer decides to retire, choosing to leave Vegas for the sticks.
[372:51.49]He can't help to feel something follows from his past.
[373:16.83]This is for real.
[373:38.98]What's in the shed?
[373:50.66]What a nice compact cabin.
[373:55.91]Says me.
[374:02.11]Yeah?
[374:02.67]Is that it?
[374:16.48]What about outside, maybe?
[374:26.77]What the fuck?
[374:31.77]Six months later.
[374:41.06]A noise outside.
[374:42.50]How do you make grass like that?
[374:47.37]Better go check what it was.
[374:48.97]How do you make grass like this?
[374:52.71]How do you make trees like this?
[374:58.99]What's this trail?
[374:59.67]Alright, how long did it take you to make this?
[375:07.82]How long did it take you to know how to do this?
[375:13.05]Oh wait, there's assets in the search bar.
[375:27.62]Less time than it took you to make this scorpion ice cream.
[375:30.20]Alright, where's over here is like a bunker What the fuck is going on
[376:10.46]I think these are the same thing.
[376:12.54]That was fucking awesome.
[376:19.14]For Jerma!
[376:20.38]What's this one?
[376:21.86]What is this?
[376:35.94]Is this a song made for me?
[376:39.36]Wanna see the timeline?
[377:14.05]These are a few of my favorite things.
[377:18.51]When the dog bites, when the... Simply remember my favorite things.
[377:29.40]So bad.
[377:43.65]You thought it was going to be a gnome?
[377:53.86]No, that's pretty good.
[377:55.12]Thumbs that up.
[378:01.14]What is this one?
[378:04.50]This is a remix of... Is this supposed to be me?
[378:13.76]So, okay, I see what you did here.
[378:15.38]You got this asset from somewhere, and then you put this fucking head on it.
[378:22.46]With the crusty, the clown hair.
[378:23.98]That has to be what it is.
[378:34.75]Remix.
[378:38.29]I love how this is kind of just feeding in here.
[378:41.61]Mystic Manor preview.
[378:48.69]What is this?
[379:01.90]Holy shit.

[379:25.26]Pot.
[379:26.76]What's over here?
[379:30.02]Haunted Hedge Maze.
[379:33.32]These are all going to be levels, right?
[379:39.51]This is pretty great.
[379:45.37]I mean, this is great.
[379:49.47]It is.
[379:55.78]What did mine look like?
[380:03.24]And maybe that's fucking awesome.
[380:05.42]I think that's it.
[380:16.07]What about mine?
[380:23.87]That's so detailed.
[380:30.91]Is another test.
[380:34.07]Alright.

[386:19.72]Once you've made something public, you won't be able to take it back.
[386:22.08]You will only be able to stop it from appearing in searches by unlisting it in the creation setting.

[387:43.41]I might jump into something else.
[387:51.00]But we're going to go back.
[387:52.83]I missed a lot today because I was just really focused trying to make sure I was doing things correctly.
[388:00.95]But six and a half hours ago, we had $15 come in from Bill Buttlicker.
[388:06.85]Thank you, Bill.
[388:11.69]Thank you, Mr. Buttlicker.
[388:12.67]I appreciate it.
[388:17.56]Long time YouTube viewer.
[388:18.62]I don't get a chance to watch your streams very much because I work all the time.
[388:22.20]But thought I would show some support for all the hours of entertainment you give me over the years.
[388:28.53]Thank you.
[388:30.25]I was on YouTube for a long time.
[388:35.17]You must have been around for a while.
[388:38.96]But always a pleasure to have anybody pop in that's been around for a long time.
[388:45.37]Thanks for the $15 and thanks for the literally hundreds of hours you've spent hanging out, watching content.
[388:56.50]It means the world to me.
[388:57.48]Thank you.
[388:59.08]Snooze and Cofter, thanks for the $2.50.
[389:01.41]Jerma, thanks for the stream.

[389:05.82]And it's 2 a.m.
[389:06.58]here now.
[389:08.00]I was hoping for a stream like this and I was worried you already prepared something beforehand.
[389:11.96]I look forward to working on Dream Stuff alongside you tomorrow.
[389:16.56]Also, are you using the motion controls?
[389:17.90]I've heard they're superior in terms of sculpting.
[389:23.24]I'm not using the motion controllers, but the motion controllers I've heard, they're good for sculpting, but they're awful for everything else.
[389:39.42]So, I've seen people switch between them.
[389:44.86]Actually switch between them when they sculpt, they use the move controllers.
[389:50.13]I might just try... You know what?
[389:51.67]Why don't we just fucking keep playing it?
[389:53.39]You know what I mean?
[389:53.87]While my voice is beating around the bush, like, I don't know, maybe.
[389:58.93]Like, I obviously want to put time into it.
[390:03.61]We'll do it again tomorrow.
[390:14.05]Because I can't think of anything else that I would be doing tomorrow.
[390:17.55]Because Friday is Salmon Max.
[390:28.24]Unless something comes up that I know that I would rather do.
[390:36.88]So I do apologize if you're one of those people that don't really want to watch this kind of stream.
[390:42.99]But don't worry.
[390:43.49]Don't worry.
[390:45.19]There's gonna be something fucking crazy in like a week or two anyway, so don't worry.
[390:55.64]I'm slowly trying to like eat and not make a bunch of noises.
[391:04.26]But...
[391:06.42]I'm ready to dunk you.
[391:07.68]I hope you are.
[391:10.76]Thank you, Snooze and Copter.
[391:11.58]Thank you, Daddy.
[391:12.44]I'm just gonna... Daddy.
[391:16.38]Thank you, Daddy, for the $15.
[391:19.68]Thanks for the laughs through the years, you goober.
[391:21.70]Thank you, Daddy.
[391:25.39]You might think it's weird me saying that, but it would be really weird if I said the rest of the name.
[391:30.73]So... Thank you for the $15.
[391:34.37]Thank you so much for hanging out here.
[391:45.39]um we also had oh I got cut off here spaghetti thanks for the five dollars funniest streamer on Twitch I'm a fireman I should make fireman I should make like a fireman game like the volcano and lava I know what I'm doing tomorrow thanks for the five dollars spaghetti uh the Jack thanks for the five dollars
[392:09.83]I want to take a screenshot, print it out, and hang this on my fridge.
[392:12.31]I'm enjoying your child finger painting in 3D stream.
[392:19.27]Well, thank you.
[392:24.67]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber for the $2.50.
[392:26.33]This stream is just the writing my sci-fi post-apocalyptic novel Silence is Appreciated joke for five hours.
[392:38.62]But...
[392:40.58]I know, but it's like... Do I have to lash out again?
[392:52.18]You're gonna make me lash out again?
[392:54.24]I lashed out.
[393:01.45]I did.
[393:01.71]I put up the shield.
[393:04.09]I defended myself.
[393:09.94]I was like, shut the fuck up!
[393:12.32]Shut up!
[393:14.24]What'd you say?
[393:14.76]What'd you say to me?
[393:17.10]Like, an hour straight.
[393:23.35]And then I got confused.
[393:25.33]I was looking at a mirror.
[393:27.87]And then I went on to talk to chat.
[393:31.12]It was like, oh, anyways.
[393:33.92]Yeah, you guys, I'm really trying to work on to be better at dreams and
[393:41.42]No, don't make me lash out again.
[393:47.56]Was it like the Warbrand stream?
[393:49.12]No, no, no, no.
[393:52.10]There was a certain percentage of people that didn't want to watch me do this.
[393:58.47]And I said... Okay!
[394:01.81]And that was it.
[394:19.57]But, no, I kid.
[394:22.85]Thank you for the 250.
[394:23.29]Thank you to Smotherum.
[394:27.33]This is $50 from Smotherum.
[394:28.33]I missed $50.
[394:28.61]5,000 bits from Smotherum.
[394:29.61]Your lake seems to have many layers, Mr. Germiser.
[394:49.51]Your lake seems to have many a layer.
[394:54.05]It did.
[394:54.37]Did I have too many layers?
[395:02.46]Thank you for the $50.
[395:03.12]That's an insane amount of money.
[395:04.60]Thank you.
[395:05.94]Freudian Weapon.
[395:06.74]Thanks for the $2.50.
[395:07.50]That's quite the masterpiece you're making.
[395:10.20]Nicely done.
[395:12.02]Practicing.
[395:13.86]Daddy-O.
[395:14.42]Thanks for the $10, Daddy-O.
[395:16.84]Hey, thanks.
[395:17.24]I had a dream that involved you.
[395:33.35]The dream started with me on this huge cube-shaped building, and I decided to enter it.
[395:38.55]I soon found out that I was trapped inside, so I started looking for an exit.
[395:43.17]I somehow knew that the very center of the building had horses, and horses would help me escape, so I head there.
[395:49.60]I was walking and I saw a weird gray slime start flowing out of a wall, and in my head that meant that a monster was nearby.
[395:57.98]I grabbed an axe and killed it.
[396:00.55]I kept going.
[396:01.37]It was at this point of the dream that I found my actual house.
[396:04.31]I went to my bedroom and went on Twitch to watch you stream.
[396:07.49]You were making your way through the same cube-shaped building trying to find the horses.
[396:11.66]People in chat were all arguing in caps about how there were no horses and that you were going the wrong way.
[396:16.76]I turned off the stream and tried to sleep, but I was too scared that a monster was going to enter my room.
[396:21.30]I just sort of ended up in my bathroom and took a bath.
[396:25.43]I was just relaxing in my bathtub, trying not to freak out from possible monsters.
[396:29.91]All of a sudden, more of that gray slime burst out of the faucet, and it got all over me and into my mouth.
[396:35.68]I was trying to claw my way out of the bath, but it was too slippery and I could not leave.
[396:40.22]This is when the dream ended.
[396:41.32]Interpret this, please.
[396:47.92]Uh... I don't know, the gray slime is maybe some- I don't know.
[396:58.07]Why do I need to interpret that?
[396:59.35]The only thing that I had to do with that was you happened to watch my stream for five seconds.
[397:06.33]You got like grey slime going into your mouth.
[397:08.72]I have nothing to do with that.
[397:09.84]You just watched me on camera.
[397:11.46]You just watched my stream.
[397:21.08]The no horses thing fucking killed me.
[397:27.16]Well, Future Gamer, that was $7.50 worth of dream.
[397:36.01]I don't know.
[397:36.85]Maybe the gray slime represents something that you're holding back.
[397:40.35]Or something that you're afraid of.
[397:42.17]And you don't want it to catch up with you.
[397:50.41]Make it in dreams.
[397:57.88]You're going the wrong way.
[397:58.90]There are no horses.
[398:00.22]I've seen that already.
[398:03.93]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $2.50.
[398:05.33]Welcome back to the Jerma985 Conspiracy Corner.
[398:08.03]Today we're going to explore theories of Etalyx being the man behind the mask.
[398:11.29]After Jerma's death in January, the Phantom of the Jerm Opera.
[398:15.23]Uh, here, it's important to... What is this?
[398:21.76]Alright, dude, this is freaking me out.
[398:29.03]I think it just blew screen to my computer.
[398:37.22]I don't even know what to say about that.
[398:38.54]That's absolutely strange.
[398:41.38]It's important to note that Etalyx has a history of faking appearances and had plenty of time to prepare.
[398:45.64]Besides, Jerma's death is canon.
[398:46.98]I checked the wiki.
[398:47.64]Join us next time as we explore the mysterious disappearance of Shito and its dastardly cover-up.
[398:53.48]Oh.
[398:54.79]The disappearance... You mean of...
[399:01.56]This guy.
[399:03.39]Disappeared.
[399:04.91]Disappeared.
[399:10.89]He's just fine.
[399:14.55]GreatLordWalden gave 40 community subs, an absolute shitload, thank you so much.
[399:20.40]That is a lot of community subs.
[399:25.42]And speaking of them, why don't we take a look at them all, fly by.
[399:31.75]Thank you for your incredible generosity, everybody.
[399:35.49]And your support of this channel.
[399:40.10]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[399:46.88]Gunther!
[399:47.76]Thank you, Gunther, for the three dollars.
[399:49.10]Bits to go.
[399:49.82]1060 bits to go till I get the hexagon.
[399:52.99]Been a while since I've been able to donate or sub, but I'm making money again, baby.
[399:57.51]Glad you're making some money.
[399:59.47]Thank you for the three dollars.
[400:03.82]Really appreciate it.
[400:05.02]Congratulations on making some money.
[400:10.80]Thank you.
[400:12.94]Multitrip!
[400:13.80]$10 for Multitrip!
[400:15.04]Don't worry about dreams being tough to learn.
[400:16.85]I know how to 3D model and draw, and I still couldn't get past the bad controls to make something for today.
[400:28.15]Well... It's just really...
[400:35.03]Your brain kind of hits a wall when you sculpt.
[400:41.05]But I do appreciate the effort.
[400:43.08]I think it's a great game.
[400:45.60]I just, like we were saying a few hours ago... I don't know what the target audience is.
[400:51.22]I don't know where they're going with it.
[400:54.98]It's kind of too hard to have anybody care about it for like a few hours a week.
[401:00.88]And it's not Unity or Unreal.
[401:08.23]It kind of sits in this weird place where it's so elaborate and has so much shit you can do that it's almost too much stuff you can do to the point where I don't know if anyone's going to use it.
[401:23.70]The controls really aren't that bad.
[401:24.76]They're just very different than anything that's been done with the controller.
[401:29.54]Yeah, I mean, that's true.
[401:34.50]I think it's supposed to be aimed for everyone, but the learning curve is really steep, but it offers so much.
[401:46.65]It's a lot of tools in one.
[401:47.79]It's a lot more fun to use than a usual game engine.
[401:49.93]Yeah.
[401:51.39]That's also true.
[401:55.83]Because I definitely found myself getting frustrated.
[401:58.05]And obviously I know I'm not an artistically inclined person.
[402:04.84]There's some people that are wonderful and can sculpt and... But for somebody that is not artistically inclined in the traditional sense, I guess, it's frustrating to use those controllers.
[402:17.59]I'm gonna try to use... I'm gonna... I'm gonna go for it.
[402:21.15]I'm gonna get up early tomorrow.
[402:22.75]I'm gonna go get a PlayStation camera.
[402:25.01]I have my Move controllers.
[402:26.15]I'm gonna try to use them.
[402:28.97]And we'll see if they make a difference.
[402:40.58]Mad because bad.
[402:44.47]You'll be amazed how nice sculpting is with the sticks.
[402:46.63]I'm looking forward to it, because it was really... I could feel myself getting just really frustrated.
[402:53.59]And I don't want to, you know, do that on stream.
[402:58.09]I don't want to be like, I don't like this.
[402:59.59]It's dumb.
[403:00.07]It sucks.
[403:01.69]You know, I don't like being that guy, so... I'm going to make a trainwreck scorpion boss ice cream.
[403:08.82]No, I'm not.
[403:12.40]We're going to make a platformer tomorrow.
[403:17.95]I'm going to just make a big space.
[403:20.95]Cubes and platforms.
[403:22.71]I'm just going to try it.
[403:30.50]I told you we're going to make a fireman.
[403:31.86]We're going to make fireman first.
[403:35.12]We're going to bring in some assets too.
[403:36.56]I'm not going to make everything from scratch.
[403:38.02]Nobody does that.
[403:40.11]Except for the talented people.
[403:41.87]The talented people do that.
[403:49.04]Is there going to be a story?
[403:50.66]I don't know if I'm that well versed to make a story.
[403:59.99]Would you mind tweeting out about the dunk tank stream when it comes around?
[404:02.69]Oh, you will know very much in advance.
[404:08.12]That's going to have a set date and a set time.
[404:11.48]At least a week before it happens.
[404:13.30]So don't worry.
[404:20.94]in a few months you're gonna be making games.
[404:25.75]Well, that's one of the reasons why I got, like,
[404:29.52]pissy pants over the things people were saying in chat today.
[404:33.12]Well, not really, but... It's because, like, alright, it's... To be able to make something, I need to spend time in it.
[404:38.81]To spend time in it, I have to put the hours in to be here.
[404:42.63]To put the hours in, I need to do it on stream, because I can't really do it off stream.
[404:46.68]So, it's almost like this cycle of... It's either stream, me learning it, or don't, and just spend ten hours a day learning it for, like, two weeks.
[405:02.85]It's kind of a rock and a hard place in that scenario.
[405:15.85]And I figure, I mean, if I'm gonna try, I might as well stream it, otherwise I'm just gonna do it off-stream.
[405:22.24]At the same time, it's hard to please everyone.
[405:24.42]Yeah, but I know that.
[405:25.44]And look, I was not... I was not that angry today.
[405:29.74]Not even close.
[405:33.13]Sometimes you don't want to tell people where I'm coming from.
[405:36.10]That's my side of the story.
[405:52.33]This game definitely has potential.
[405:53.45]It does.
[405:58.13]It does.
[406:04.40]But I'm gonna... I wonder if I can go get the camera now.
[406:09.56]Is everything open in... I mean, I live in Las Vegas.
[406:13.52]Everything's fucking open.
[406:19.10]That ice technique was really nice.
[406:22.62]It's fun to have Eureka moments and just do it.
[406:25.31]I just wish I knew more and knew about where things should be and how to do them.
[406:30.05]It's funny because if you give me 3D Movie Maker right now...
[406:33.16]I could show you every fucking little technique, every tiny little thing.
[406:39.99]Weird workarounds and... I will never forget that stuff, it's burned in my brain forever.
[406:54.46]I feel like some people think every stream has to be a high-energy clown comedy stream.
[407:02.34]Yeah, but... That's kind of my fault though, you know what I mean?
[407:06.00]Like, I... I do these... A lot of my streams are, like, fucking high-energy fucking clown comedy streams.
[407:14.17]So I can understand when people come here and they're like, wait, he's... He's just gonna play Dreams?
[407:19.77]And he's gonna just sculpt?
[407:23.01]Why?
[407:24.95]Where's, like, the car crash?
[407:28.18]Now, a lot of that's my own doing, right?
[407:38.55]Wouldn't blame you.
[407:39.17]No, and I'm not... I'm really not trying to make this some kind of thing about, well, you know, I really wish I could do this and not have to work.
[407:49.47]No, it's all good.
[407:50.28]I was not... I'm kind of making this more of a bigger deal than it was today.
[407:56.64]It just wasn't at all.
[407:59.56]I mentioned it for like maybe 30 seconds.
[408:06.89]You set the bar too high with the scorpion battle Should I have not pulled that out so quickly because then I went yeah, you know I went from that to just like making a mountain I just yeah, I went from that to snow covered mountain Oh
[408:36.43]You started with the main event.
[408:38.83]Yeah, but I wanted you to... I wanted you to see what my... I did!
[408:48.71]You gave them Hogan versus Andre first.
[408:53.42]Yeah, but do you think... Alright.
[408:54.60]Do you think anyone would have stuck around if I started with the snow-covered mountains?
[409:01.54]No, people could see the potential with the Scorpion boss battle.
[409:04.64]They know, holy shit, this ain't just a snow-covered mountain stream.
[409:20.65]You know, content creation's hard.
[409:21.97]You never know what to start with.
[409:24.91]Start with a beetle battle.
[409:26.09]You know what?
[409:26.71]Maybe I'll just stay.
[409:27.47]I don't know, man.
[409:28.09]Maybe I'll just... Maybe I'll just be a psycho.
[409:32.43]I, I, I said, I said this last time, but I might, maybe I'll just be a psycho tonight and I'll just make a bunch of stuff tonight.
[409:45.31]And then just I'm streaming early tomorrow.
[409:52.38]Maybe.
[409:58.47]No, but then I gotta, like, I gotta go.
[409:59.81]I have to, like, drive.
[410:02.45]So I can't do that.
[410:07.16]No, I don't, I don't want to, like, no, that's not a good idea.
[410:13.72]What's tomorrow?
[410:14.36]Tomorrow is an early stream.
[410:15.96]And then I'm due, I have to take Otto to the bed.
[410:23.36]So we're gonna go for, like, six hours before five.
[410:31.86]But, let's finish up the bits.
[410:34.28]We're at the end here.
[410:37.25]The Bala Koala gave $14.
[410:38.77]Dude, stop looking for horses.
[410:40.21]There are no horses.
[410:41.19]FailFish.
[410:43.89]Shut up.
[410:44.15]Yes, there are.
[410:46.97]Thank you for the $14, Bala Koala.
[410:48.66]Thank you, Sikilos, for the five bucks.
[410:51.97]Jeremy, would you mind tweeting out info about the dunk tank stream?
[410:54.78]We caught that earlier.
[410:56.96]Yes, yes.
[410:58.22]My friends and I want to plan a big watch party for it.
[411:00.72]Well, it's not going to be, like, next week.
[411:03.68]I will give you at least one week notice.
[411:06.11]I'm, like, trying to prod every single resource here to get this going in the next couple weeks.
[411:16.47]If that goes well, that stream's going to be a ton of fucking fun.
[411:27.06]Am I still alive?
[411:28.48]Did we actually turn off?
[411:30.86]I think we may have actually turned off.
[411:35.75]Maybe not.
[411:37.87]I think we're still on.
[411:42.05]But yeah, you will know far in advance.
[411:43.53]I'll tweet about it.
[411:44.13]I'll talk about it.
[411:45.08]And I'll give some actual detailed, detailed details of how it's going to work when it does happen.
[411:52.28]Hey, C2K, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[411:56.12]Hey, Jerma, are you ever going to play God of War, the 2018 one?
[411:58.50]I mean, the PlayStation is hooked up right now.
[412:03.43]So, maybe I'll just do that after Sam & Max or something.
[412:11.25]Sounds like a fun game.
[412:13.25]It looks amazing.
[412:16.15]Thank you for the $10, and yes, I do plan on playing it.
[412:21.36]Hey, Mr. Comcast, thanks for the six bucks.
[412:24.57]You gonna bail me out here, Mr. Comcast?
[412:26.23]Hey, Jerma John, Comcast here, sitting in my Scrooge McDuck bank vault of money.
[412:29.11]Got me thinking, well, what if money can't buy us true happiness?
[412:35.83]It's a question that I ponder often, and I was wondering if you knew the answer.
[412:39.30]Also, in other news, can you move the billions that are in your overseas Swiss bank account somewhere else?
[412:43.68]You're clogging it up for all of us other rich boomers.
[412:46.94]If you don't move it up, you'll be forced to tell people about the Ponzi scheme you run on your Twitch streams.
[412:55.19]Sure, well, um... No, no, I don't think money buys happiness.
[413:02.04]I think happiness comes from within.
[413:05.60]Happiness comes from within.
[413:08.96]Happiness comes from within.
[413:13.83]Um... Get your fucking money out of my way.
[413:21.22]I got plenty of those bank accounts than mine.
[413:23.64]I've got the papers signed over, Mr. John Comcast, you ain't gonna get your hands on any of it.
[413:34.84]Oh no, his happiness is escaping!
[413:41.21]No.
[413:45.43]But money can ins- insulate you from exterior factors that can make you unhappy, that's true.
[413:50.43]That is true.
[413:54.76]But I, here, uh, you know when you put a, you know the whole goldfish in the bowl thing?
[414:00.14]The goldfish just gets bigger, the bigger the bowl you put it in?
[414:08.22]You're, it's almost like, even if you have a million dollars, you, your life kind of just, that becomes normal.
[414:23.46]and even having a million dollar life like a multi-million dollar life cannot like buy you love it can't oh did we get cut off I think I was about to say something really really important what the fuck is going on it hasn't been this bad in like months
[414:54.95]Well, uh, I did not expect it to be this bad tonight.
[414:59.17]Um... Well... Uh... Okay.
[415:14.75]You got it out of your system now?
[415:15.83]Are you gonna keep doing it?
[415:16.53]Are you gonna keep cutting me off, or what?
[415:22.94]If money could buy some better internet, you'd think that would be true, but it's not.
[415:43.28]What was I saying?
[415:47.88]I sure would love to tell you what I was saying.
[415:57.26]God it went down to zero again What the fuck You know, I'm I'm just gonna type it um I'm gonna type it because I can't say it I
[417:35.35]Okay.
[417:47.84]Got it.
[417:48.40]Done.
[417:49.08]Can you hear me?
[417:57.76]That's a new coffee pot.
[417:59.02]Okay.
[417:59.54]Alright.
[418:00.72]I think I can speak again.
[418:05.60]So yes, money alleviates the burdens of life to have a comfortable life.
[418:11.26]But it cannot put people in it.
[418:13.26]And as humans, we strive and we long for true friendship, true love, and things to share with other people.
[418:22.45]We long for it.
[418:23.09]We want it.
[418:24.27]You can't buy it.
[418:25.61]You can buy... You can buy pretend.
[418:29.36]but not the real thing.
[418:30.80]And we all want the real thing.
[418:32.39]So, you know, you could have $5,000 in your checking account.
[418:37.17]You could have $5 million in your checking account.
[418:39.79]The $5,000 checking account person may have a ton of fucking great friends and a bunch of wonderful people in their life, somebody that they love,
[418:50.30]And they just live their life.
[418:52.10]The person with the $5 million might have, might pay for a bunch of shit and might own a bunch of cool stuff, but they might not have anybody to share it with.
[419:00.77]Or the people that they are sharing it with might, they might not have a true connection.
[419:09.57]I know this because I have $4 million in my bank account and everybody fucking hates my guts.
[419:13.76]Nobody likes me.
[419:14.80]I'm just, I'm kidding.
[419:15.38]I'm kidding.
[419:16.74]I would, I don't have that much money.
[419:24.26]I do not have, even remotely, a percentage of that.
[419:28.74]That's not water, it's a seltzer water, relax.
[419:38.15]But, no, I'm a firm believer of the only reason why you really do anything at all
[419:50.09]is because if it's somehow some way you want to share it with someone you know oh I want to go out I want to go out to dinner tonight I want to go out to dinner why because I like this restaurant but why do you want to go to that restaurant because they have good food anything else uh well hold on I went to zero no we're back okay
[420:20.82]But whenever you go deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, and you think about it, you want to go to that nice restaurant with somebody so you can experience the food together, so you can... It's like this human thing.
[420:36.31]I want to go to the restaurant because... Oh, hey, how is that?
[420:39.99]Is that... Is the pasta good?
[420:42.97]It is good!
[420:43.69]Yeah, it's good, isn't it?
[420:45.47]I got the chicken.
[420:46.27]Oh, it's amazing.
[420:46.89]You want to try?
[420:49.71]Mmm, yeah, no, it's really good.
[420:51.11]Yeah, try it, try it.
[420:52.19]Yeah, I really like that wine that they were serving.
[420:55.07]It was really good wine, wasn't it?
[420:59.90]Experiences with other people.
[421:10.74]And they don't all have to be at like a restaurant.
[421:14.72]There are plenty of
[421:16.92]You know, does it cost anything?
[421:17.86]I mean, of course it costs something to, you know, use the internet.
[421:22.87]But I know a lot of people that have a bunch of friends that are online.
[421:26.11]That they've met through, you know, playing video games.
[421:29.67]And look at half of the people that I know.
[421:31.93]The connections that I've made with people.
[421:34.64]Because we were making YouTube videos and shit.
[421:40.24]I think... I think it's nothing to do with money.
[421:42.88]It has to do with having experiences with other people that you like.
[421:48.73]Unless you go to a 3D movie by yourself, which is fine.
[421:51.87]I did it.
[421:53.09]And you're the only person in the theater and you get to experience the 3D movie alone.
[421:58.76]It was fucking cool and it was great.
[422:10.15]And experience like a cooking stream.
[422:19.01]But... No, it's not all about the dollar.
[422:25.21]There are plenty of people that are not happy with lots of money.
[422:28.37]And there are plenty of people that aren't happy that don't have money.
[422:30.57]There are plenty of people that are really happy that don't have a lot of money.
[422:33.82]It's just who the person is.
[422:36.78]And I'm not going to pretend like... No, money doesn't do it.
[422:41.98]Money does a lot.
[422:42.96]It does.
[422:45.04]But it will not fill the human connection.
[422:50.91]And with that, that's my talk.
[422:53.37]And I will see you guys tomorrow afternoon.
[422:54.99]Early this time.
[422:55.93]Make sure you get up.
[422:57.67]We've got some stuff to do.
[423:04.69]Which WWE game is the best?
[423:05.99]2K14.
[423:07.83]The rest are terrible.
[423:11.33]2K, well, 2K13, 2K12, okay, maybe.
[423:13.73]They're pretty good.
[423:15.21]Everything after 2K14 is awful.
[423:20.68]There it is.
[423:21.98]Have a good night.
[423:23.04]I will hopefully have an internet that works tomorrow.
