[00:33.89]Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38.09]It's me, the Joker.
[00:40.11]Yeah.
[00:42.01]What's going on, Starstrike?
[00:45.85]Thanks for the sub.
[00:46.59]And not your neighbor's dog.
[00:51.64]Good evening.

[00:53.36]I just did that already.
[00:54.80]Can't do it again.
[00:57.62]Late?
[00:57.90]Yeah, I'm late.
[01:00.20]It's kind of annoying to set this up.
[01:02.82]Running it in the window was kind of hard to do.
[01:04.86]And if I didn't run it in the window, then guess what?
[01:08.10]Would have been at like 1280 by 1080 or something.
[01:12.08]Fucked up.
[01:15.64]Give me just a moment here, guys.
[01:17.42]Just chill.
[01:18.94]Hang out.
[01:20.08]Minus one point for every second you're a late streamer?
[01:22.16]Well, Grimman, thanks.
[01:23.62]But the two months up.
[01:26.34]I will be back, and we'll talk about the movies.
[01:29.52]I'm going to edit this text to say... It's going to say this.
[01:38.50]Movie's one minute.
[01:39.76]There we are.
[01:40.32]Send out that shit.
[01:41.44]Here we go.
[02:21.14]Wait, what?
[02:24.74]Okay.
[02:25.78]I'm here.
[02:26.98]I'm here to play.
[02:52.18]Let's get this situated over here.
[02:54.64]So I can see the subs and the bits if they come in.
[02:57.80]And you should be able to see it.
[03:01.20]Can you see it?
[03:01.78]I think you can.
[03:03.92]Wow.
[03:05.18]Oh.
[03:06.82]Heck yeah.
[03:11.72]Should I turn the music down?
[03:12.46]What do you guys think?
[03:13.95]Music down?
[03:14.55]Music up?
[03:17.59]Who gives a shit?
[03:20.65]Let's turn it down a little.
[03:24.03]It's hard to hear myself think when music's blasting in my one ear.
[03:32.52]Although, it's probably pretty interesting music.
[03:37.63]Alright, so, if you're curious what the hell this is, what's gonna happen here tonight... Uh... This was very heavily requested by at least a few regulars in the chat.
[03:49.18]pump up the jams yeah apparently this is a game it's a like tycoon game but the difference with this I guess is you actually make movies you have actors that you you actually have to make the movie so we're gonna make some movies I only have one ear I only put headphones in one ear if I put a headphone in the other ear I am useless
[04:15.81]You guys want a way to make me completely and totally catatonic and, like I said, useless?
[04:22.50]Put two headphones in my ear and put something loud enough where I can't hear, like, the human voice.
[04:28.80]And I will have to sit there with, like, my mouth drooling.
[04:31.21]I can't do anything.
[04:33.67]We could make rat movie.
[04:34.65]If there's rats in it, we could do it.
[04:36.07]Calling us not regulars?
[04:37.53]No, no, I'm just saying, like, there was a couple people that were, like, very adamant that I play this game.
[04:44.56]You can have people slip on banana peels.
[04:51.22]Look, I went to film school.
[04:53.13]I know how to make movies.
[04:54.13]We're going to make some gold ones.
[04:55.37]We're going to make some good ones.
[05:00.33]I want to formally apologize for last night's stream.
[05:05.08]It fucking sucked.
[05:06.52]So we're going to redeem ourselves tonight.
[05:09.14]Hey, by the way, we're going all night.
[05:11.66]Fuck, why did I just say that?
[05:13.65]Why do I have to make those dumb jokes?
[05:15.71]Alright, I need to kind of learn how to play.
[05:21.65]We're gonna learn how to play.
[05:26.89]I minored in art, so that's even better.
[05:30.51]It wasn't that bad.
[05:31.19]I know, I'm just kidding around.
[05:34.71]I fell asleep during the Skate 3 stream.
[05:38.91]Well, I don't blame you.
[05:39.97]24 hours.
[05:42.21]No, we'll see how much fun we have.
[05:43.67]I feel like I could have a lot of fun with this game.
[05:47.87]Yeah, Wednesday night, all night stream.
[05:49.51]This is going to be great.
[05:51.53]Then how am I going to have any energy for tomorrow?
[05:53.79]Alright, let's go.
[05:54.74]I need to learn the basics.
[05:56.84]So let's go.
[05:57.38]Thank you for joining me.
[06:00.70]Let's learn how to play the movies.
[06:02.04]It's probably going to be loud.
[06:06.82]Maybe not.
[06:11.34]I love how it's doing the- Welcome to the movies!
[06:12.44]Okay.
[06:12.54]Yes!
[06:12.64]I don't know where that is.
[06:13.22]I don't know where that is.
[06:14.48]Right here?
[06:14.90]That's not it!
[06:34.16]You can move around the studio lot by moving the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen.
[06:39.15]Or you can use the arrow keys.
[06:41.07]Oh, thank God.
[06:41.61]Try this now.
[06:43.25]I hate... Can I, like, hold the mouse button down and do that?
[06:45.35]Nope.
[06:45.91]This game's from 2005.
[06:46.65]You're not allowed to do that.
[06:48.85]Looks like we're using, like, arrow keys.
[06:52.07]This is old school, like, red alert controls.
[06:56.13]Okay, that's fine, yeah.
[06:57.19]Information about characters and objects is displayed in bubbles.
[07:01.41]Try hovering the mouse pointer over a person in the studio lot.
[07:06.91]Great.
[07:10.51]This is a wannabe star.
[07:12.22]Let's talk about how you hire someone or assign them a job.
[07:15.92]Have a look at the stage school building.
[07:18.36]Okay.
[07:19.78]Stage school building.
[07:21.39]As you can see, each building has a floor plan that's divided into a number of rooms.
[07:26.52]You can perform actions by placing people and objects within these rooms.
[07:31.18]Create extra, create actor, create director, CAUSE A FIRE!
[07:35.55]CAUSE A FIRE!
[07:37.49]To pick up a person or object, you can hold the left mouse button for a short time while the pointer is hovering above them.
[07:47.10]Okay, and then pick a person, click and hold the left mouse button, and... You can pick people up.
[07:51.38]Can I drown them?
[07:52.06]That's it.
[07:52.40]Now drag this person over the create actor room in the stage school.
[07:56.42]Wait, what?
[07:57.84]Rooms turn green when you can perform an action.
[08:01.42]Left click to drop a character or object into a room.
[08:04.80]Do this now.
[08:05.64]Alright, create actor.
[08:06.34]Congratulations.
[08:07.92]You've just hired your first star.
[08:10.46]Can't wait.
[08:10.86]We're gonna make so many good movies.
[08:13.75]Go it all night.
[08:16.62]So this is, I just made like an actor.
[08:17.88]Sparkling streams will guide you in the right direction, suggesting where to go next or where to place a person or object you're holding.
[08:25.88]Sparkling streams.
[08:27.85]They're talking about my stream.
[08:31.17]Alright.
[08:32.59]Where to go next.
[08:33.23]Okay.
[08:33.51]So like right here.
[08:34.83]Alright, grandma.
[08:35.37]There you are.
[08:38.02]Okay, now pick up your new star.
[08:40.78]The guiding stream is suggesting you place your star in the nearby trailer.
[08:45.44]Do this now.
[08:46.18]Oh, this is gonna be so much fun.
[08:48.52]I hope you guys are ready.
[08:50.18]We're gonna assassinate this lady.
[08:53.83]Fantastic.
[08:55.15]You're really getting the hang of this.
[08:57.29]You'll be making movies in no time.
[09:00.27]Okay, a sign.
[09:02.57]Sparkling streams will also suggest things to build.
[09:06.14]Click on the build menu button now.
[09:08.44]Build.
[09:10.34]Okay.
[09:10.54]That's it.
[09:11.84]Now click on the sparkling facilities button.
[09:14.80]Then again on the snack van button.
[09:17.27]Snack van?
[09:17.89]Okay, snack van, $3,000.
[09:21.43]The place where your employees can buy quick, cheap, artery-clogging snacks.
[09:26.58]You can place the building in your studio lot by left-clicking on the desired location.
[09:31.91]Try this now.
[09:34.21]The outline will go red if there is something in the way.
[09:38.83]How do I rotate it?
[09:40.35]Can I rotate this?
[09:44.45]Looks like it's trying to tell me to put it... How do I rotate it?
[09:48.74]Tell me the secret to rotate.
[09:50.80]I'll make her happy.
[09:51.48]I'll put it right here.
[09:54.06]I love when you click something in this game and you build it.
[10:00.87]It makes an explosion.
[10:04.27]So, by the way, what you're watching right now, this is like not even half the games.
[10:08.97]Stick around.
[10:10.41]This is not like a tight... We actually make movies with the actors in like a movie making program.
[10:15.85]So just stick with it.
[10:17.15]Alright.
[10:21.17]Star icon.
[10:23.28]Each of your stars, movies, and staff members has an icon on the side of the screen.
[10:28.55]Hover over this star icon now.
[10:31.19]Okay.
[10:32.67]Hovering over a star icon will reveal information about that star.
[10:36.75]Not a Final Fantasy stream?
[10:39.21]Left clicking on a star icon will move your view to that star in your studio lock.
[10:43.95]Sure does.
[10:44.43]How do I get them to fight each other?
[10:48.91]To pick up a star, you can left click, hold, and drag them off their star icon.
[10:53.93]That's it.
[10:55.05]Now you know how to use star icons.
[10:57.23]Alright, that was easy.
[10:57.99]Drop the star when you're ready to continue.
[11:00.37]I really wish I could just fucking toss them.
[11:03.60]Okay, now let's learn more about information bubbles.
[11:06.44]Emergency indicators, like the one now over your star, highlight problems you need to deal with.
[11:12.06]Emergency, you put me on the grass.
[11:14.12]To view this information.
[11:16.94]Okay, you can see the star's mood.
[11:18.30]Okay.
[11:18.73]Okay.
[11:18.95]Yeah, so she's happy.
[11:33.24]Wait, what?
[11:34.26]Hovering over a person or object will reveal its information in order of importance.
[11:39.69]Hover over your star or their star icon to try this.
[11:43.21]Hover over your star?
[11:44.79]To quickly view all of the information on a person, simply right-click on that person.
[11:49.47]That's what I wanted to know.
[11:50.17]Right-click them.
[11:50.89]Try it.
[11:52.79]This person's 19?
[11:53.67]This person's 19 years old.
[11:59.88]I thought they were like 75.
[12:00.50]Alright.
[12:00.96]Okay, interesting.
[12:02.74]Cool.
[12:02.84]Oh, moving the view around.
[12:05.36]Yeah, yeah.
[12:05.56]I already learned that.
[12:06.92]I already know how to do that video game.
[12:32.24]You can also do this by holding control.
[12:34.08]What?
[12:36.20]Why would I need to do that?
[12:38.28]You can rotate your view around a point by pressing down the middle mouse button.
[12:43.06]Then moving them.
[12:43.92]Okay.
[12:44.88]Now you know how to zoom and rotate your view.
[12:47.61]Thank you.
[12:48.33]Great.
[12:49.15]You now know how to interact with characters and find out information about them.
[12:53.59]Here we go.
[12:53.97]I hope you guys are ready.
[12:57.37]And you know how to interact with building floor plans.
[13:00.47]We know how to deal with sparkles.
[13:01.49]You now have the skills to begin running your own studio.
[13:04.97]So get started.
[13:05.98]He's like The Sims?
[13:07.44]Okay, let's go.
[13:09.32]Alright.
[13:10.48]Did anybody learn anything from that?
[13:13.54]I didn't learn a damn thing.
[13:16.10]It told me that look out for the sparkles and watch how angry people can be sometimes.
[13:21.99]And how to move around.
[13:22.79]That didn't teach me a fucking goddamn thing.
[13:25.55]Alright, new game.
[13:27.76]Studio name.
[13:29.38]Plucky Pictures.
[13:30.80]Name?

[13:42.05]We gotta have a good studio name.
[13:45.27]Why is there only a clown and, like, a naked lady?
[13:50.83]We need a... Oh, definitely the eye.
[13:53.45]No, no, no, no.
[13:54.39]The fucking horse?
[13:57.44]Bald Eagle?
[13:58.32]The Meat Cleaver.
[13:59.06]We're gonna make horror movies.

[15:31.61]First, build a thriving studio.
[15:34.27]Hire wannabes and nurture them into your stars.
[15:37.87]Make the movies that'll get the big bucks rolling in and clean up at the awards.
[15:43.60]Then, with every award you win, with every success you enjoy, your studio's reputation will grow.
[15:51.03]I don't know where we are.
[15:51.91]Soon, stars from rival companies will flock to your studio, and you'll unlock new technologies, scenes, and sets to make your movies better than ever.
[16:02.99]So, what are you waiting for?
[16:05.72]You've got a suitcase full of cash and a world full of possibilities before you.

[16:10.96]Get out there and start making your dreams come true.
[16:14.30]Because in the movie industry, anything is possible.
[16:18.08]I got it pretty good.
[16:18.87]Welcome to your new movie studio.
[16:20.77]I did that pretty well.
[16:23.65]Alright, new movie studio.
[16:24.97]This term of being three people.
[16:26.19]Alright.
[16:26.55]Stage school.
[16:27.50]What was the point of the tutorial?
[16:29.90]Why did they make the tutorial in this game?
[16:52.32]This is the tutorial.
[16:54.50]It doesn't make any sense.
[16:56.33]That whole thing didn't need to exist.
[16:59.11]Alright.
[16:59.33]We need a stage school of $5,000 where actors and directors are hired and taught their craft and how to say darling in annoyingly high-pitched voices.
[17:07.88]Okay.
[17:08.04]You can place the stage school anywhere by left-clicking at the desired location.
[17:12.50]Go ahead.
[17:13.86]Give it a try.
[17:15.04]Well, let's make it like – how much space do we have?
[17:19.78]We'll make this like the centerpiece like it was in the tutorial because we're terrible at video games.
[17:24.40]To build the stage school, you need to hire a builder at the staff office by the studio gates.
[17:29.16]Who are these people?
[17:32.50]These are people lining up for work?
[17:34.22]Move your mouse pointer over one of them?
[17:35.76]Now click and hold down the left mouse button briefly to pick them up.
[17:41.13]These people want to be actors and I'm going to make them build a building.
[17:44.48]Great.
[17:45.08]Now click and hold down the left mouse button briefly to pick them up.
[17:49.30]Now hire them.
[17:50.76]Follow the sparkling stream and drop them in the creating builder room by left clicking.
[17:55.39]Hey, you see, son?
[17:56.27]You want to be an actor?
[17:57.05]You want to be a big star?
[17:58.33]You're going to have to build the buildings first.
[18:01.13]Great.
[18:02.13]By the way.
[18:03.66]Oh, I thought that changed your gender, but it's alright.
[18:08.64]Get in those clothes!
[18:11.14]Okay.
[18:11.34]Create a janitor.
[18:18.00]Oh, welcome, sweetheart.

[18:24.96]Well, first, you're gonna have to be the fuckin' janitor!
[18:30.63]We'll see how you grind your teeth on this one.
[18:36.47]Okay, we'll see.
[18:37.15]Alright, what else do we need?
[18:40.44]Okay, now build a casting office.
[18:42.60]You'll need this for assigning stars to your movies.
[18:45.50]Just follow the sparkles on the build menu.
[18:47.92]Alright, I need to make a casting office.
[18:53.44]Casting office, the place to assign your director, select your cast, organize a crew, and allow your stars to rehearse for a forthcoming movie.
[19:01.60]Can you shut up up there?
[19:03.44]I'm trying to do a little bit of a tutorial here.
[19:06.40]You can rotate a building by holding down the left mouse button and moving the mouse around in a circle.
[19:11.80]Thank you for telling me that.
[19:12.70]Try this now.
[19:13.50]You know, it would be great if you told me that in the tutorial that I clicked on.
[19:17.68]Not the action.
[19:18.20]I'm going to put this over here.
[19:19.30]This is the casting office.
[19:22.79]Over here somewhere like here.
[19:26.76]Now build a crew facility.
[19:28.86]Every movie needs a crew to operate the filming equipment.
[19:32.10]Crew facility.
[19:32.99]Okay.
[19:36.47]Hire crew and fire your movie crew.
[19:38.47]Okay.
[19:42.99]Let's put the crew building back here.
[19:45.19]Go over here.
[19:52.90]Right.
[19:55.49]There.
[19:56.22]I'm gonna blow all my money.
[20:00.76]Why is it so loud?
[20:01.76]I don't know why they do an explosion.
[20:03.90]Alright, which one of the... Should I pick one of these same ladies?
[20:08.38]Alright, we got Caitlin Griffin, PJ Hughes, Ashley Boslett, or Jane Gibson.
[20:15.56]Alright, come on, Hughes.
[20:19.64]Okay, you'll also need a set to shoot your movie on.
[20:22.86]Let's get a set.
[20:23.60]The stage set will be perfect for your first movie.
[20:27.42]Wait, what?
[20:28.06]It's the 1920s, it was way louder back then.
[20:30.71]Left click on the sets icon, then select the stage set.
[20:34.61]Stage, a good all-purpose set for basic movie scenes, ideal for practicing comedy roles, okay.
[20:40.59]Set's gonna be over here, behind all this shit.
[20:44.90]Finally, build a production office.
[20:47.18]You'll need this to release your movie.
[20:49.81]Production office.
[20:51.13]This one is huge.
[20:53.79]This way.
[20:55.23]Okay.
[20:55.51]You can't walk to anything, it's just open space.
[21:12.55]Okay.
[21:12.87]Yeah, I need paths.
[21:13.67]Ooh, sparkling path!
[21:14.53]Remember they told us about this?
[21:16.10]Paths?
[21:16.38]Paths get your staff around a lot.
[21:17.28]Yeah, yeah, it's a path.
[21:17.84]Okay.
[21:18.00]Oh, that's very good.
[21:42.66]I'm glad you're able to do that in a game this old.
[21:45.38]Because typically wouldn't it be like, yeah, you gotta do it individually.
[21:50.68]I'll go here.
[21:54.34]Hey, all these motherfuckers playing Planet Coaster, check me out.
[21:58.14]Okay, that'll do for now.
[22:00.18]Remember to lay down more pads as the studio expands.
[22:02.98]Why did I just like talk shit about, what was the point of that?
[22:08.09]Alright, cool.
[22:10.21]Nice working environment.
[22:14.33]Star is mad because we didn't play D&D today.
[22:20.08]I couldn't play today.
[22:20.88]I had things to do earlier.
[22:22.94]Sometimes you have things to do.
[22:25.52]Okay, another important factor is placing items in ornaments.
[22:29.10]Okay, ornaments.
[22:30.78]Bush.
[22:32.78]You know what would make me just work a little better?
[22:34.28]I think a bush.
[22:34.58]God, you know what would make me work so much more?
[22:37.25]Looking at a bush every day.
[22:38.31]And this too.
[22:52.83]No, let's make it like that.
[22:56.08]Okay, time to move on.
[22:58.12]Remember to place down more ornaments as the studio expands.
[23:00.96]Okay, you fucking idiot.
[23:01.96]Like, let's go.
[23:03.52]Excellent.
[23:04.35]The studio is now ready.
[23:06.67]Carry on improving things if you wish.
[23:08.39]Deck dolls.
[23:08.73]And when you're ready, you can open the studio.
[23:11.01]Furniture.
[23:11.87]Furniture.
[23:15.25]Oh shit, this is a bathtub there?
[23:16.77]Oh, whatever.
[23:18.41]Alright, basketball hoop and a bathtub.
[23:21.08]Shit, that's a thousand dollars.
[23:22.40]That was a one thousand dollar joke.
[23:26.06]Saving game.
[23:26.62]Okay, whatever.
[23:27.16]Alright, let's keep going.
[23:31.32]Am I?
[23:31.52]I don't know.
[23:31.88]Is everything open?
[23:33.26]This thing hasn't been built yet.
[23:36.33]Where are my builders?
[23:38.73]Excuse me.
[23:41.65]Oh, that's the janitor.
[23:42.53]Oh, never mind.
[23:43.01]Where are the builders?
[23:51.61]I guess we're not quite ready.
[23:52.73]Oh, there we go.
[23:53.13]They're building it now.
[23:55.51]All the sound effects are from Skate 3 right here?
[23:57.81]Hold on.
[23:59.63]I gotta get a path.
[24:04.26]Where was the path?
[24:04.70]There it is.
[24:06.80]It's not ready yet.
[24:07.82]I'll just open it.
[24:10.06]Alright.
[24:15.84]Let's make a movie.
[24:18.54]Who are these people?
[24:23.25]Looking doesn't bore easily.
[24:25.29]Who the fuck are these people?
[24:27.41]And why is everybody, like, 18?
[24:31.37]These people are lying about their age.
[24:32.87]This person's, like, 45.
[24:35.61]Where are they running?
[24:37.85]I've just got to get to that production studio.
[24:41.36]Even the local station's talking about you.
[24:42.90]Okay, so... Stage school.
[24:48.78]Okay, we need... Let's make a movie.
[24:51.56]What is that?
[24:53.35]Okay, time to make your first movie.
[24:55.65]Here we go!
[24:56.33]You won't get far without an actor and a director.
[24:59.41]So select a couple of appropriate wannabes at the stage screen.
[25:02.70]Yeah, that's what you are, a bunch of wannabes!
[25:06.94]20 years old?
[25:07.94]You don't have like gray hair at 20.
[25:09.60]Alright, let's see.
[25:11.68]Action.
[25:12.60]We want horror movies, so the first movie's gonna be a horror movie.
[25:15.05]This person has a lot of experience in horror.
[25:19.51]This person has no experience at all.
[25:21.26]Right here.
[25:21.76]Like, I'm sorry, get out.
[25:23.14]You don't have experience?
[25:26.46]Sorry.
[25:26.96]Horror.
[25:28.30]Actually, she's getting back in line.
[25:33.16]Didn't I tell you?
[25:33.72]You weren't ready?
[25:36.36]Looks, physique.
[25:37.06]Alright, we want... This person's a horror director.
[25:38.88]I'm gonna make her a horror actress.
[25:42.38]$6,000.
[25:42.46]Okay.
[25:42.58]Action, horror, this... Alright.
[25:43.93]Anybody else over here?
[25:44.81]Like, waiting in line?
[25:46.11]No.
[25:46.17]Why are there only, like, four people that want to work?
[25:47.89]I kind of want to go to work.
[25:49.13]I want to be a director.
[25:50.29]Fine.
[25:50.43]Go for it.
[26:11.98]Here we go.
[26:16.64]Comedy.
[26:17.63]Script complete.
[26:18.51]Ready for casting.
[26:19.31]I don't want to make a comedy.
[26:22.13]I don't know how to hire any screenwriters.
[26:24.75]Huh?
[26:24.99]Somebody just left a script at my front door.
[26:26.25]Alright.
[26:40.67]Follow the stream to the casting office where you can get your new stars to rehearse the script.
[26:45.60]Begin casting for this comedy.
[26:48.38]Okay, your movie now needs a cast and a director.
[26:52.28]Let's start by assigning your new director.
[26:54.38]Alright, we need a new director.
[26:59.11]Director's face to the side.
[27:00.45]Okay, so if you're a director, you look this way because you don't want to be on camera.
[27:03.23]Got it.
[27:03.39]Alright, well, you're a director.
[27:11.67]So we need a director.
[27:13.81]Uh, okay.
[27:14.37]Director.
[27:15.29]This person is terrible.
[27:17.88]They have no experience.
[27:20.54]Here's my actress that I hired.
[27:23.36]They're both horror movie people, but it's okay.
[27:27.42]Uh, lead roles.
[27:28.44]Alright, you're gonna be the lead role.
[27:30.62]Do I need a crew?
[27:39.36]Okay.
[27:40.92]I still need a couple of extras.
[27:43.06]Create crew.
[27:43.88]Alright, these people are in line.
[27:49.98]Alright, movie crew, movie crew.
[27:51.18]You all have no experience, so it doesn't really matter.
[27:53.14]Just get in there.
[27:54.22]Okay.
[27:55.18]That's good.
[27:55.56]It's going pretty well.
[27:56.50]Good rehearsal.
[28:10.30]Almost there.
[28:14.06]She's rehearsing her lines and she's yelling into a cone.
[28:19.23]Alright.
[28:20.07]The Baggage Boy rehears- Wait, the name of this movie is The Baggage Boy?
[28:26.91]I didn't name this movie.
[28:30.22]The baggage boy.
[28:31.54]Let's do it.
[28:31.96]Let's do it.
[28:33.18]Let's make our first movie.
[28:34.23]The baggage boy.
[28:34.97]Here we go.
[28:35.51]I can't wait.
[28:35.89]Nice.
[28:36.09]Okay.
[29:02.13]Casting crew.
[29:03.09]Crew 2 assembling on set.
[29:09.15]The Burgah Boy.
[29:10.12]Alright, get over here.
[29:12.02]We need to start shooting.
[29:16.90]Oh, fuck.
[29:17.72]There's no path.
[29:19.22]Hold on.
[29:22.02]I'm gonna bring the chair.
[29:25.71]I'm hired to bring the chair over there.
[29:29.29]Shit, hold on a minute.
[29:30.09]I gotta fix this.
[29:36.50]place to go.
[29:39.66]The first scene is now being shot.
[29:42.10]You can see the overall movie progress in the movie's information bubbles.
[29:44.62]How do I, like, make the movie?
[29:46.22]I thought I, like, don't I shoot the movie?
[29:50.04]Scenes that are still to be shot are displayed in the movie's shooting schedule bubble.
[29:55.11]Each scene shows which set it will be shot on.
[29:57.79]Okay.
[30:00.35]So they're gonna all be here.
[30:02.31]Okay, now you can continue to follow the movie's progress.
[30:09.65]How do I shoot my own movie?
[30:11.69]Oh, after this, okay.
[30:12.83]Okay, cool.
[30:13.69]So, a new set.
[30:14.61]Wild West Saloon.
[30:15.15]Oh, boy.
[30:15.45]Alright, well, here, we're gonna obviously connect this set to this one.
[30:19.97]We're gonna have a giant set studio over here.
[30:23.75]Ow.
[30:23.83]Now, how's this one going?
[30:42.05]I can't wait to make my own movie.
[30:44.13]So, for those of you wondering, alright, I want to make sure I break this down so people don't get uninterested.
[30:49.65]Like, you actually physically go in and you make... Oh, no, the game was going to crash.
[30:54.63]No, it's good.
[30:55.79]You go in, like, scene by scene and make the movie.
[30:58.49]So, don't worry.
[31:00.15]This is just the intro.
[31:00.97]Alright, this is worth looking at the rest of the studio.
[31:04.87]Look around the studio for information icons.
[31:06.41]Okay.
[31:06.93]Anybody playing basketball?
[31:08.64]No.
[31:08.82]Oh, oh, oh!
[31:11.67]M key to enter map mode.
[31:12.73]Okay.
[31:17.67]That's cool.
[31:19.07]Alright.
[31:22.86]Somebody want to build this, please?
[31:24.66]Get over there.
[31:28.74]How is this a comedy, by the way?
[31:32.03]Look at how funny this movie is.
[31:33.27]Oh, she's going to lift up the big barbell and she's going to hurt her back.
[31:39.56]I can't lift it up.
[31:40.52]This is pure comedy from 1930.
[31:42.58]Oh, no.
[31:47.27]And cut.
[31:48.45]Release it.
[31:49.67]What a fucking hilarious movie.
[31:52.33]Got it.
[31:52.95]Print it.
[31:54.09]Send it in.
[31:57.27]It's a wrap.
[31:57.91]Told you.
[32:01.74]Oh, that was just fantastic.
[32:03.90]That was unbelievable work.
[32:07.93]Alright, anything else I need to look at before we go?
[32:10.07]This is still going.
[32:12.58]The baggage boy.
[32:13.42]What the fuck does it have to do with barbells?
[32:16.80]Oh, yeah.
[32:17.56]And the baggage boy.
[32:19.06]Some lady can't lift barbells up.
[32:22.38]She can't seem to lift it.
[32:25.53]The baggage boy.
[32:26.61]I guess we can just chill.
[32:30.69]Alright, let me take a look at what we have in here.
[32:32.67]Whoa, boy.
[32:34.25]Hold on.
[32:36.31]Double left-click on an empty set for a fly-through that will show off its key features.
[32:42.69]Okay.
[32:42.89]Okay, in this loon, this looks exactly like that Wild West game I played like a year ago.
[32:48.36]What the fuck was it called?
[32:49.08]I don't know.
[32:50.60]It's the one where you punch people.
[32:53.30]This is going to be a fucking great movie in there.
[32:55.36]I can't wait to make it.
[32:57.66]I cannot fucking wait to make a film there.
[33:01.18]We're going all night.
[33:07.56]Hope you guys are ready.
[33:11.10]This one's almost done.
[33:13.55]In the meantime, let me say a special thank you while we wait for this movie to be complete and we can continue to play the game.
[33:22.03]Cyborg92, thanks for two months.
[33:23.45]Volkmar Nacknud for two months.
[33:27.33]Boosh511, go milk tea for three months.

[33:44.18]Do me a favor.
[33:44.84]Fucking freeze.
[33:45.63]What freeze?
[33:47.71]24-hour stream, though.
[33:48.65]We're not going that long.
[33:49.67]Going long, though.
[33:51.13]This stream will probably be at least six to eight hours long.
[33:54.25]I would assume.
[33:55.29]Because it's piqued my interest.
[33:58.23]I want to make a fucking movie.
[33:59.84]I'm here, and I'm ready to go.
[34:00.86]You know what I mean?
[34:03.63]Uh, thank you, Shadowbolts, for three months.
[34:05.65]Jah!
[34:06.27]God damn it!
[34:07.09]Shooting has finished on your movie, and it's now ready for release at the production office.
[34:11.26]That scared the shit out of me.
[34:12.64]Alright, the movie's done.
[34:13.36]You guys ready to see the movie?
[34:14.26]The Baggage Boy?
[34:16.38]It's done, it's at the production office.
[34:19.22]Ready for release.
[34:22.42]Alright, let's... Should we release it?
[34:23.72]Let's... Okay, movie player.
[34:27.40]Oh god, the movie is attempting to receive an audio stream.
[34:31.02]Hold on, what?
[34:33.07]Uh...
[34:35.07]Yeah, okay, what the- Alright, here comes the baggage boy!
[34:38.63]This is so loud, I'm sorry!
[34:58.62]Oh, she can't lift it!
[35:00.62]Oh, no!
[35:35.53]I knew it!
[35:36.09]I knew it!
[35:36.43]That was the whole movie!
[35:38.01]I knew it!
[35:38.95]No, wait, no, I'm back in the frame!
[35:40.61]What the fuck is this movie?
[35:46.52]This movie's terrible!
[35:50.50]Why is this baggage boy?
[35:52.21]Dude, I can't...
[36:01.51]That's it, movie's over.
[36:03.15]Movie's over.
[36:04.07]Good movie.
[36:06.07]That's the whole movie.
[36:10.53]What?
[36:11.41]How do I get out of here?
[36:13.38]Stop it.
[36:14.76]Stop the movie.
[36:18.56]That movie's not ready for release.
[36:22.38]Release the movie by placing it... Okay, let's release it.
[36:25.81]No, boy.
[36:26.45]The package boy!
[36:30.55]Oh wow, that was a 10 out of 10 movie.
[36:40.97]That movie doesn't have a quarter of a star.
[36:45.48]I didn't think that was possible.
[36:47.42]I don't think that was possible.
[36:49.08]Sometimes you see half a star, sometimes you see one star.
[36:52.20]I don't see, I've never seen a quarter of a star before in my life.
[36:58.11]No watch your movie.
[36:58.99]I don't want to watch that again.
[37:00.31]No fuck We're not watching that again Alright, we got our first movie Monica Dubinska
[37:13.85]I just want to be very clear about something for a second.
[37:16.79]Let's just break it down.
[37:18.83]Monica Dubinska made $4,000 on that movie.
[37:24.25]And Elizabeth Beery made $3,800 on that movie.
[37:28.12]The production of that movie was $10,000.
[37:30.02]And it lasted six months.
[37:37.08]That movie took six months to make.
[37:49.52]Oh, here are the reviews.
[37:50.96]A movie packed with originality.
[37:52.32]The sets used in this movie were pretty good in condition.
[37:55.08]A movie with some pretty poor direction.
[37:58.35]The overall quality of acting in this movie is appalling.
[38:01.35]I don't like how she lifted up the barbells.
[38:05.11]You'll just be stunned at how much Elizabeth Berry's lack of experience affects her performance here.
[38:12.10]Yeah, no shit.
[38:12.50]The movie was awful.
[38:13.32]Excellent.
[38:14.02]Your first movie has been released.
[38:16.36]Releasing a movie has given you some recognition.
[38:18.64]And you're now listed in the official industry charts.
[38:23.63]Okay.
[38:25.71]We're making money on that movie.
[38:27.53]$5,000.
[38:27.69]Okay, cool.
[38:28.25]I love how the baggage boy seems to be doing well.
[38:34.48]What the fuck was that noise?
[38:37.23]That was weird.
[38:38.53]Okay.
[38:38.75]Your studio's chart rating is based on the movies you release, the stars you employ, and the overall status of your studio.
[38:47.04]The bigger your stars, the higher your studio rating.
[38:50.34]Right.
[38:52.32]Make a Glue Man movie?
[38:53.10]I'm gonna make a bunch of fucking dumb movies.
[38:54.11]The better your movies, the higher your studio rating.
[38:57.59]Cool.
[38:58.07]To view the star, movie, and studio charts, left-click on the rosette.
[39:03.27]Now that you have a movie out...
[39:06.59]Okay, February 1921.
[39:07.35]Linear production... Alright, these are the other studios.
[39:14.79]Holy shit, all these movie studios are so bad.
[39:19.31]Does it concern anybody else that the number one studio in the world has one star?
[39:25.53]I'm doing pretty well then, apparently.
[39:29.02]By comparison... Okay, cool.
[39:36.35]Finally, this guy's playing basketball.
[39:39.33]Please tell me he's going to play basketball and then take a bath.
[39:42.01]No, I don't want him tired of that.
[39:43.75]But this bath over here looks real interesting.
[39:48.44]Come on, take a bath.
[39:51.88]Get in the bath.
[39:54.08]Get in there.
[39:57.83]That would have been great if he got tired.
[40:00.43]What was I doing?
[40:03.24]Take a look at my stars.
[40:04.32]Okay, let's take a look at my stars.
[40:05.32]Your employees need good sanitation, so place down some restrooms to improve your studio rating.
[40:10.89]There's no bathrooms.
[40:12.83]Okay.
[40:13.03]Let's get some bathrooms in here.
[40:16.65]Small restroom.
[40:17.73]Let's put, like, two of them.
[40:22.09]Why not right outside the main door?
[40:23.94]Your employees need good catering provisions, too.
[40:27.02]A snack van will do for now.
[40:28.68]Snack van's gonna go right here.
[40:31.94]So people don't have to walk too far to get it.
[40:34.14]This will raise not only your catering rating, but your overall studio rating too.
[40:38.99]My studio rating go down?
[40:39.91]No, no, I added a bathroom.
[40:42.93]So now I'm the second best studio in the world.
[40:46.31]Apparently, apparently the other two studios underneath me don't have a bathroom yet.
[40:50.82]So we're in direct heated competition.
[40:56.64]Happy stars make better movies.
[40:59.08]If you want a star to perform well in a movie, you need to make sure they're happy.
[41:03.11]Boom.
[41:03.51]Okay.
[41:05.11]So I want to make sure.
[41:07.03]And their mood bar shows you how happy they are.
[41:09.29]They're doing okay.
[41:12.41]Yeah, you're doing fine.
[41:15.66]Let's take a look at you.
[41:16.74]This is the lead actress.
[41:19.54]And the mood bar shows you, okay.
[41:20.60]I would love to rate it.
[41:21.34]Cool.
[41:21.48]What's she doing?
[41:21.98]She's throwing shit on the ground.
[41:40.31]Try hovering over your stars to see how they feel.
[41:44.91]One way to improve a star's image is to give them a makeover.
[41:48.01]To do this, you'll need to build a makeover department first.
[41:52.04]Stop the steam train.
[41:53.10]Where's their train track?
[41:54.34]Is that the fucking stupid snack bar?
[41:57.84]Okay.
[41:58.22]Alright, hold on.
[42:00.72]Improve a star's image to give them a makeover.
[42:03.35]Build a makeover department.
[42:05.83]This is very vain.
[42:07.46]Remember, you can rotate a building by holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse around in a circle.
[42:13.99]Go on, give it a try.
[42:15.35]All the sets are gonna be like in this area.
[42:17.71]All the other bullshit's gonna be over here.
[42:19.21]Oh, like this way.
[42:23.39]Like over here.
[42:23.89]Right here.
[42:25.29]You can drop builders around the sides of the building to speed up construction if you want.
[42:29.47]Okay, drop builders.
[42:33.64]Use the arrows above the star icons to view your other staff types.
[42:37.62]I need some more staff.
[42:38.54]Staff icons can be used in the same way as star icons.
[42:42.44]Yeah, movie.
[42:43.20]No, these are movie crews.
[42:44.38]Okay.
[42:45.16]While the makeover department is being built, try placing a few more ornaments around your studio.
[42:49.90]I want this to go a little faster.
[42:53.76]What is it?
[42:54.38]Fix the bathroom?
[42:57.78]Oh, no.
[43:00.56]I want this shit to go a little bit.
[43:01.66]This is just like the orcs.
[43:04.52]These are the orcs in Planetside 2.
[43:09.92]I mean, Warcraft 3.
[43:11.32]Warcraft 2.
[43:11.80]Okay, whatever.
[43:16.01]Place more ornaments.
[43:16.77]It wants me to put more ornaments around?
[43:18.13]Okay, I can do that.
[43:21.81]What else was there?
[43:25.33]Go with this?
[43:26.33]Put it right.
[43:27.29]Okay.
[43:28.07]The makeover department is built.
[43:30.24]Okay.
[43:30.38]Pick up a star whose image you want to improve.
[43:33.88]Whose image do we want to improve?
[43:39.74]Who has a bad image?
[43:40.78]Let's see.
[43:43.08]You stay right there.
[43:43.66]I want to see how bad your image is.
[43:47.23]Your image is pretty high, actually.
[43:48.43]I don't think I need to do anything with you.
[43:49.41]What about you, Grandma?
[43:52.20]Your image is alright, too.
[43:53.42]But, you know what?
[43:53.98]You need a makeover.
[43:54.80]Okay.
[43:55.50]Give this star a makeover.
[43:57.59]Follow the guiding... Drop a star in the makeover room to enter the makeover screen.
[44:02.01]Oh, God.
[44:02.65]Oh, yeah.
[44:03.15]Oh, here we go.
[44:04.30]Alright.
[44:04.62]Here's the makeover.
[44:05.50]Let's go for it.
[44:25.52]Oh, look at how beautiful you look now!
[44:27.36]Or use the auto room if using the makeover screen is a lot quicker than an auto makeover and gives you more control.
[44:34.14]Oh, no, you can't.
[44:34.64]Be careful not to choose something a star is unhappy with.
[44:40.33]Oh, shit.
[44:42.09]She's not happy that I gave her a beard.
[44:43.73]Okay.
[44:45.75]Make sure all your stars are happy with their image.
[44:48.87]When you're ready to move on, click.
[44:51.00]We gotta take the beard off.
[44:53.48]No, fuck it.
[44:54.18]The beard's staying on.
[44:56.19]I don't give a shit how bad you are.
[44:58.62]No, I have to.
[44:59.46]Auto.
[44:59.62]Yeah, this is the tutorial.
[45:00.72]I can't fuck around here.
[45:01.38]She'll pick what she wants.
[45:02.58]Let's see how happy she is.
[45:25.20]We're gonna wait and see exactly what she wants because she wasn't happy with the beard the lipstick and the tattoos and the funny hat So I'm gonna wait and see what she wanted
[45:40.96]She's got a monocle, too.
[45:42.04]Does she have, like, green eyes?
[45:44.11]Okay, she's almost done.
[45:46.13]Oh, hold on.
[45:47.97]She found something she likes.
[45:49.47]She spent a bunch of my money.
[45:50.97]Okay.
[45:52.03]She's gonna get in the changing room.
[45:54.97]And... She has chosen... She has chosen...
[46:07.65]To keep the beard.
[46:09.15]She kept the beard.
[46:09.97]It wasn't the beard that was the problem.
[46:12.47]It was the dress.
[46:13.53]She's got the beard still on.
[46:20.15]Okay.
[46:21.03]Alright.
[46:21.83]I can't say it was... She's still unhappy.
[46:30.76]She's still not happy.
[46:33.60]Why are you still so unhappy?
[46:35.02]What did I do wrong?
[46:36.91]Your image, you had the choice to change your image.
[46:40.06]Oh, boy.
[46:41.38]Okay.
[46:43.52]What are we doing now?
[46:47.54]This guy's always playing basketball.
[46:52.95]Every time I come over to this guy... No, see?
[46:55.45]Watch.
[46:56.01]He knows.
[46:57.95]He fucking knows.
[46:58.85]Every time I come over here, he knows I'm looking at him and he's pretending to go back to work.
[47:02.47]No, I wasn't playing with that basketball.
[47:03.87]What are you talking about?
[47:04.65]I was just checking on it.
[47:05.63]Checking to make sure there was enough air in it.
[47:08.40]It's the same guy every time.
[47:12.02]Alright, what am I doing?
[47:13.36]Revisit the makeover department if any stars aren't happy with their image.
[47:15.34]Okay.
[47:16.86]She is so sad right now.
[47:19.16]But, whatever.
[47:20.74]Nothing I can do about it at this point.
[47:22.24]Alright, let's do it.
[47:23.04]Let's keep going.
[47:23.52]Let's make a new movie.
[47:25.11]New movie?
[47:25.35]Mm-hmm.
[47:34.84]Well, here's the plus side to this.
[47:37.83]She's not going to want much more money.
[47:39.45]Hover over one of your stars to see how they feel about their salary.
[47:43.55]If you want to give a star a raise, take them to the production office.
[47:48.17]Maybe a raise will make you feel better.
[47:49.91]Work, comedy, actress, salary, $6,000.
[47:52.11]Salary.
[47:52.45]She's happy with her salary.
[48:04.28]She's just unhappy that she didn't shave her beard.
[48:07.88]She's unhappy with her salary.
[48:09.12]We'll take, we'll deal with her.
[48:10.60]No?
[48:10.66]Okay, bro.
[48:10.92]To review star salaries, place a star in the finance room in the production office.
[48:16.18]What?
[48:16.36]I just, they can talk?
[48:16.98]Hover over one of your stars to see how they feel about their salary.
[48:20.06]Shit, I fucked this up.
[48:20.85]If you want to give a star a raise, take them to the production office.
[48:24.93]Do you like my beard?
[48:25.69]Oh, I love it.
[48:27.97]We're gonna give her some self-confidence here.
[48:31.65]Alright.
[48:33.45]Salary office is down here.
[48:34.86]Okay, how much money?
[48:35.40]Well, salary satisfaction, current influence.
[48:37.34]I'm going to give her some extra money because she's not happy.
[48:39.66]$6,500?
[48:39.76]Come on.
[48:40.06]$7,000?
[48:40.36]What?
[48:40.52]What?
[49:03.20]They're gonna be fighting, though.
[49:04.08]If one of them makes more money than the other one, aren't they gonna know?
[49:07.80]If I give her an extra $500 a year, then she's gonna be like, what the fuck?
[49:14.68]Oh, fuck it.
[49:15.02]Who cares?
[49:15.34]And that's when they get fired.
[49:17.14]Shit.
[49:17.26]I knew it.
[49:17.62]I knew it was gonna happen.
[49:29.73]I laughed so hard that she kept the beard.
[49:31.27]I got the hiccups.
[49:33.29]It was fucking pretty crazy.
[49:36.17]It wasn't the front.
[49:37.08]It was the dress.
[49:37.68]It was, like, the clothes.
[49:38.36]At some point, your stars will begin to get bored and will need something new to do.
[49:42.32]Yeah, I got the bathtub and the basketball court.
[49:45.66]There's plenty of stuff to do.
[49:46.56]If the board and bar falls below the threshold line, a star will become very bored, which will affect their mood.
[49:52.27]I'm making money here, though.
[49:52.95]The bar will gradually go down when a star has no work.
[49:56.84]Now, we're going to board them.
[49:59.06]Okay, board them.
[50:01.14]They're alright.
[50:01.60]They're doing fine.
[50:02.04]Let's get a movie going.
[50:02.98]Yes, let's go.
[50:03.46]Let's go.
[50:03.74]New script.
[50:04.08]Let's see what this movie is.
[50:05.14]Love Lasso.
[50:20.52]Remember to follow the guiding streams and read the information bubbles to see what you need to do.
[50:26.26]Mm-hmm.
[50:26.68]Okay, so this is casting.
[50:27.80]We already have crew members.
[50:30.46]We need a director.
[50:31.38]This movie has some minor roles that you can fill with extras.
[50:35.06]You can hire extras at the stage school.
[50:37.40]Okay.
[50:39.26]Who wants to be an extra?
[50:40.16]Dude, this guy has been sitting here.
[50:43.32]Both these guys have been sitting here for a long time.
[50:44.88]Alright, you want to be an extra?
[50:49.02]Sure.
[50:49.94]Available extras will automatically fill any minor roles in your movies.
[50:54.22]You got it?
[50:54.58]They'll gain genre experience, and you can turn them into stars if you think they're good enough.
[50:59.32]I need some directors.
[51:00.02]I need a romance director, right?
[51:02.86]How are you in romance?
[51:04.84]You're okay.
[51:06.08]You're okay in romance.
[51:07.10]What about the other director that I have?
[51:08.44]Is there a way for me to see?
[51:13.16]Oh, here we go.
[51:13.50]Staff.
[51:14.86]Staff.
[51:17.47]Crew, where are my directors?
[51:19.83]That's director, right?
[51:21.34]Oh, that's a janitor.
[51:24.94]Extras.
[51:28.14]Builder, these are builders.
[51:32.34]These are crew members, movie crew members.
[51:36.83]That looks like, no, where's my director?
[51:40.18]Oh, right here.
[51:40.54]Okay, never mind.
[51:41.02]Sorry.
[51:42.02]I'm stupid.
[51:42.36]Alright, how are you in romance?
[51:44.22]You're terrible in romance experience.
[51:45.66]I don't want you directing my new fucking romance novel.
[51:49.14]But you, on the other hand, you are perfect.
[51:55.99]Director.
[51:56.97]Romance.
[51:58.75]Get on in here.
[52:01.57]Now we need a romance actress.
[52:02.67]How are you in romance?
[52:04.55]Zero.
[52:07.57]Both of you are zero in romance.
[52:08.75]Well, let's just try to make her feel better.
[52:10.42]Let's give her a leading role.
[52:14.04]Now, let's rehearse.
[52:17.00]Shoot it!
[52:19.80]It's not even a novel.
[52:20.90]It's a script!
[52:22.46]It's a script.
[52:25.46]Now, I'm gonna make some more minor adjustments here.
[52:29.96]Snack van.
[52:30.44]I already have a snack van.
[52:35.40]Wild West already had that.
[52:39.69]Let's get some fucking more bathtubs in here.
[52:45.37]Who needs like the most... No, no more bathtubs.
[52:48.97]Is this a swing set?
[52:51.54]What the hell is this?
[52:54.84]What is that?
[52:56.60]Is this a pull-up bar?
[52:57.62]Alright, let's put like a bench here so you can watch somebody do pull-ups.
[53:04.76]Oh, that's awful.
[53:05.64]I'm gonna... That'll change eventually here, don't worry.
[53:09.21]Alright, rehearsing the script.
[53:10.07]Let's shoot it.
[53:11.79]This reminds me of Theme Hospital.
[53:12.97]We're going to eventually get to the point where we can film our own movies, which is where I want to get to.
[53:30.95]Keep an eye on your star's moods during shooting.
[53:34.00]If a star's mood bar is glowing green, they will give a great performance.
[53:38.56]But if it's glowing red, they'll give a very bad performance.
[53:42.70]As the studio improves, you'll attract more job seekers to this building.
[53:45.40]If needed, job seekers from other buildings can also be hired here.
[53:47.81]Okay.
[53:51.08]Here we go.
[53:51.52]We're gonna use the same dumb fucking set.
[53:53.84]There are some new sets available to build, which will help add variety to your future movies and keep the public interested.
[54:00.26]We're not gonna do another barbell movie, are we?
[54:05.72]Please tell me that if a barbell shows up here, I'm going to fucking shit my pants.
[54:09.69]No, no, it changed a little.
[54:12.79]Movies can be themed around one of five different genres.
[54:16.29]Action, comedy, romance, sci-fi, and horror.
[54:19.39]Sci-fi, horror.
[54:20.31]Making movies of different genres and using different sets will keep your movies fresh and interesting.
[54:27.68]Action.
[54:28.04]Here comes the romance.
[54:31.30]How's that another actress or actor?
[54:34.40]She shaved.
[54:35.80]She shaved for the part.
[54:37.94]Maybe she had to.
[54:39.86]Okay.
[54:40.82]Let's get a new set.
[54:41.42]Cut.
[54:43.96]Where is it here?
[54:45.23]Cast?
[54:45.51]I don't know.
[54:45.93]It's here.
[54:48.35]Musty Cellar.
[54:50.07]Starship Bridge.
[54:51.17]Alright, we're gonna do Musty Cellar.
[54:55.99]Over here.
[54:58.87]Different genres.
[55:00.67]Romantic sci-fi comedy.
[55:02.86]This is a very long tutorial.
[55:04.60]But I think it has to be here.
[55:06.66]Oh wait, they're shooting another scene here.
[55:10.38]They're going in here.
[55:12.78]Ooh, we're going to get a pretty... Uh-oh, she's angry.
[55:16.24]She's throwing a tantrum.
[55:22.67]Apparently throwing a tantrum.
[55:23.95]Get in there.
[55:24.41]Where are you going?
[55:29.97]Get in the movie set.
[55:31.95]Get in here.
[55:35.69]You came here to work.
[55:37.91]Not run around and throw a tantrum.
[55:41.87]Oh, there we go.
[55:43.31]Get in there.
[55:45.97]You do what I say.
[55:46.83]I'm the fucking big boss.
[55:50.94]Alright.
[55:51.12]Okay.
[55:51.46]Well, she's not experienced, but whatever.
[56:09.71]Can we get more than one?
[56:10.81]Let's hire a bunch of people.
[56:13.51]These are crew members.
[56:14.49]I don't think we can.
[56:16.31]Something got finished.
[56:18.45]I don't know what the hell that was.
[56:24.07]Release.
[56:24.71]Alright, the baggage boy has made almost $100,000.
[56:27.57]Just shocking.
[56:28.29]Are we still alive?
[56:29.45]Uh...
[56:40.43]Okay, I guess.
[56:56.37]Uh, okay.
[56:57.27]We're apparently... That was weird.

[57:12.93]She's getting in shape for her next roll.
[57:20.22]Let me just make sure everything's going smoothly here.
[57:28.01]Yeah, I'm still live.
[57:32.27]Did I press a button?
[57:33.17]Did I end the stream accidentally somehow?

[59:54.73]Fantastic.
[59:55.85]Your latest movie has been released.
[59:58.01]To get to the top of the charts, you'll need to focus on improving the star ratings of your stars.
[60:03.68]Yeah, and now we're at the bottom.
[60:06.16]Alright.
[60:07.76]That's two movies done.
[60:08.88]I want my money back.
[60:10.75]No refunds.

[63:28.42]Because I don't know what you want.
[63:29.38]How am I supposed to know these things?
[63:31.36]The script writing office is built.
[63:33.34]Time to start writing a new script.
[63:35.22]Here comes that first script.
[63:36.52]What is it going to be?
[63:37.58]Horror movie, right?
[63:41.11]The baggage boy is done.
[63:44.68]Okay, archive it.

[64:00.47]Alright, script writing office.
[64:01.97]Where is the script writing office?
[64:03.09]I just built it over here.
[64:05.21]Okay.
[64:07.44]Taking someone from the line and placing them in one of the rooms.
[64:09.74]Pick your favorite movie genre.
[64:10.94]Okay.
[64:13.38]Ugh.
[64:14.72]This guy's looking for work.
[64:15.68]Script writing.
[64:17.04]What?
[64:17.32]That guy died.
[64:19.64]What the fuck happened to that guy?
[64:23.41]Why did this person just fall down?
[64:27.91]Did this slip on a banana peel?
[64:34.39]What?
[64:36.07]Alright, script writing.
[64:36.89]Who cares?
[64:37.37]Alright, here we go.
[64:39.27]Horror, action, romance, sci-fi, comedy.
[64:42.81]Horror.
[64:44.52]Yes, this is what I'm talking about.
[64:45.64]Script writers will write a script based on the genre you've selected and the sets you have.
[64:50.50]Although this gives you less control over the details, it allows you to focus on other things.
[64:55.62]Okay, while the script is being written, let's take a look at the relationships between your stars.
[65:00.28]Let's take a look at the stars again.
[65:01.40]Good chemistry will boost the quality of your movies.
[65:03.78]Pick up one of your stars, then you can get them socializing.
[65:07.56]You can hover over each star to see how they feel about their colleagues.
[65:12.91]Yeah, they all think each other is real swell.
[65:16.50]Great.
[65:17.26]Now let's find another star.
[65:19.18]Yeah.
[65:19.46]To make two stars interact, you can see how a star feels about another star when you hold them over a chat icon.
[65:26.25]She got her makeover, right?
[65:26.95]Drop this star onto the icon to make them interact.
[65:29.75]When you make two stars interact, you'll be able to see what they're thinking.
[65:34.19]Guys, she put the beard back on.
[65:35.81]Okay, while you're waiting for the script to finish...
[65:38.74]And she still doesn't care.
[65:41.16]She shaved it and put it back on.
[65:42.42]She's gotta be fucking kidding me.
[65:44.87]She put the beard back on.
[65:59.80]Uh... Practice on set.
[66:01.00]Go practice.
[66:02.00]Okay, cool.
[66:02.98]Yeah, and then they go to the snack bar.
[66:28.05]Oh yeah, you mean speed it up?
[66:34.36]You mean go wicked fast?
[66:39.66]Triple speed.
[66:40.90]Quadruple speed.
[66:43.07]Holy shit, this takes a long ass time.
[66:51.83]This is a very long time.

[77:18.22]Oh, wow.
[77:18.62]That studio would do well to release another horror movie after such a superb first effort.
[77:24.30]The cast as a whole was a little more than adequate.
[77:30.17]The pinnacle of this studio's achievements.
[77:32.89]It was somebody pretending to get shot with a machine gun.
[77:39.62]I fucking already love this game.

[79:20.40]So, wanna make sure I completely understand how everything's working.
[79:24.12]And then we'll just make whatever the hell we feel like making.

[80:07.40]Yeah, you're fired.
[80:08.44]Get rid of her quick.
[80:12.10]How do I fire her?
[80:14.68]You're fired.
[80:15.18]Okay, it just made like a gunshot sound.
[80:21.67]You know, I gave you a couple chances to change your image and you didn't do it.
[80:24.35]So you're fired.
[80:27.21]Now I kind of feel bad.
[80:32.18]Easily stressed, easily bored, loves to eat, and can't turn down a drink.
[80:38.26]Yeah.

[81:08.82]I feel bad now.
[81:09.86]I know, I kind of do too.
[81:12.18]But to be fair, I gave her a new image and she didn't like it.
[81:15.85]And she had the choice two times to fix it.
[81:19.25]I got lots of money.
[81:20.01]Let's like fucking spend it.
[81:23.07]Starship Bridge.
[81:24.19]Shit.

[82:02.35]Okay, good first scene.
[82:07.59]Cut.
[82:08.17]Let's get the next scene going.
[82:12.19]I mean, it's a wrap.
[82:14.59]I love how they can only film in one spot.
[82:17.23]That's so awful.
[82:18.56]I can't wait to make my own goddamn movie.
[82:21.68]Okay.

[94:46.07]I need to release five movies.
[94:49.76]Earn $500,000.
[94:50.95]And release movies with a total star rating of 5.
[94:54.41]Are you fucking kidding me?
[94:57.93]That's going to take a million years, isn't it?
[95:03.78]How the fuck am I going to do that?
[95:05.16]I think it might be time to go to sandbox mode.
[95:10.98]That might be time to do sandbox.
[95:12.42]You think I'm going to make a 5 star movie right now?
[95:18.33]Yeah, we're going to sandbox mode.
[95:19.59]I'm going to save this just in case.
[95:22.48]But I got the basics.
[95:23.64]I know how the game works.
[95:25.32]We're going to sandbox.
[95:27.84]Main menu.
[95:32.42]All my movies were half a star.
[95:36.79]New game, sandbox.
[95:39.37]Game starts at... We're starting in the 50s.
[95:42.24]With this much money, with a hundred million dollars.
[95:45.42]Ah, that's a... Instant movie making.
[95:48.04]Choose whether films are instantly shot if they go through the entire movie.
[95:51.68]Okay, buildings instantly constructed.
[95:54.16]Hmm.
[95:58.79]Well, that lasted a while.
[96:01.97]I don't have the expansion.
[96:03.41]But, if I have enough fun with this game, then I can have the expansion by tomorrow and I'll stream the game tomorrow.
[96:11.62]Five stars total?
[96:14.41]It's total, not all at once.
[96:18.25]Was it?
[96:18.57]Okay, well then maybe it'll happen.
[96:23.49]This is an option.
[96:24.19]Holy shit, there's like skeletons and zombies and stuff.
[96:26.05]I can't wait.
[96:26.43]Alright, so those of you that have this game, in my saved game right now, how much longer game time would it be before I get to make my own custom movies?
[96:44.37]So like where I am right now.
[96:47.93]What would you say?
[96:48.53]Those of you that own the game.
[96:53.99]It's just to stay in the game that I had.
[96:59.52]Three minutes.
[97:00.10]At least two hours.
[97:02.14]Five to six hours.
[97:04.36]Holy shit.
[97:06.16]Probably a long time.
[97:08.22]Three to four days.
[97:10.73]Two hours.
[97:14.58]I did it when I was 10, but probably a couple hours.
[97:16.82]Two to three hours max.
[97:20.28]It's gonna take a couple years, like, in the game.
[97:22.24]Okay.
[97:25.70]Alright.
[97:26.28]Well, let's just get into the sandbox and just play around.
[97:28.92]This will be just... I wanna know, like, what we can do.
[97:32.08]That save game is not gonna go anywhere.
[97:36.02]So, alright.
[97:37.04]Start with a ready-to-build studio lot.
[97:41.87]Let's start with, like, a lot ready to go.
[97:48.15]Like three hours.
[97:52.83]I just want to see what's possible, you know?
[97:55.40]Coward?
[97:55.84]Don't go.
[97:56.34]Come on.
[97:56.82]This is sandbox mode.
[97:59.12]Stars?
[97:59.46]No, no, no.
[98:00.12]That's all I want.
[98:00.70]I just want a hundred million dollars.
[98:02.38]Alright, let's just go.

[98:10.31]And that symbol.
[98:10.89]Whatever the fuck that means.
[98:14.31]Check out.
[98:14.65]Well, I don't want to be that.
[98:15.77]I mean...
[98:17.07]Turn it all on.
[98:19.09]That's like cheating, isn't it?
[98:23.11]I got a fully made lot.
[98:24.79]It's time to make some movies.
[98:28.23]Alright.

[118:44.50]No.
[118:44.90]Well, I want you wearing the other costume.
[118:52.68]Maybe I just have to save it.
[118:59.03]Okay, this just got inherently better.
[119:01.77]It's gonna be like a guy in a chicken suit.
[119:06.13]Yeah, you're getting the fucking chicken suit.

[119:34.28]No, shit!
[119:35.23]That's the wrong guy.
[119:45.33]And then somebody else in a chicken costume shoots the guy who's supposed to be in the chicken.
[120:05.56]Okay, so.
[120:06.78]We gotta start back here.
[120:09.42]We gotta put these people at all in mascot costumes.

[121:37.59]Okay, then.
[121:38.11]This is her again, right?
[121:44.30]There's only like... There's like fucking two actors here.
[121:48.08]Why do you keep doing this, lady?
[121:55.76]Okay, I very clearly have her selected, but it does not want to make her in the chicken costume.
[122:03.96]You know what I'm saying?
[122:04.96]Am I doing something wrong here?
[122:06.04]Because I very clearly want her to be in the chicken costume.
[122:15.19]That's her, right?
[122:15.88]Okay, that was weird.
[122:31.74]Alright, then... But the question is here, who actually pulls out the shotgun?
[122:36.97]Is it her?
[122:40.11]I think it is, yeah, it's her.
[122:46.35]So this guy has to be in a different costume.
[122:47.67]It can't be two chickens.
[122:55.28]Okay, it's gonna be the guy in the robot costume.
[123:05.51]Let's just see what happens here.

[128:32.49]She gave him the poison's fucking cigarette.
[128:37.54]Yep.
[128:39.18]But then... What you don't know... Wolfguy gets the fuck up.
[128:43.86]They thought they had it done.
[128:45.26]Nope.
[128:52.66]He's got an axe.
[128:53.20]No.
[128:53.26]Uh...
[129:01.98]Doesn't even show him getting up.
[129:06.46]No, no, no.
[129:07.04]It can't be that.
[129:08.18]It can't be that.
[129:10.08]Subway carriage.
[129:13.74]Pursuit.
[129:14.32]Okay.
[129:26.80]Hold on.
[129:27.70]They gotta get off the subway.
[129:29.80]They gotta get off the subway.
[129:33.55]Keep this one in mind.
[129:34.85]Because we're going to use that.
[129:37.89]Critical talk.
[129:43.44]He has to get up and shoot one and then chase him out.
[129:50.24]Person shot.
[129:50.94]There it is.
[129:51.28]I need more actors in here.
[129:59.55]Where is he?
[130:13.68]This takes a long fucking time.
[130:15.68]Hold on, wait, no, that doesn't make any sense.
[130:19.38]Doesn't make any sense.
[130:21.96]Regain consciousness, okay.
[130:26.43]Regain, regain, regain.
[130:30.75]Regain consciousness.
[130:38.81]Why does it always have to be the same person?
[130:43.21]Should he have no costume on now?
[130:44.49]Alright, regain consciousness.
[130:52.44]Oh, shit.
[130:53.72]Wait a minute, why is it showing us this?
[130:57.58]Oh, boy.
[131:00.50]He's not dead.
[131:01.38]He's still alive.
[131:06.83]He's very slowly getting up.
[131:13.11]Okay.
[131:17.62]Okay, can I like trim that shit?
[131:19.92]That's way too long.
[131:26.34]duration short backdrop.
[131:35.39]And this is when the train stops by the way.
[131:38.51]He gets up quick.
[131:42.37]Actually, let me go in here now.
[131:47.13]And we're going to go in this light.
[131:49.89]It's scrolling.
[131:51.45]Yeah, this is fine.
[131:52.93]They're on the tree.
[131:56.71]I love that image so much.
[131:59.79]Okay, they're sneaking up behind him.
[132:01.59]Let's take a look at what we can change in here.
[132:03.91]Attack style.
[132:06.83]Chop, neck pinch, neck break.
[132:10.98]What the fuck does that do?
[132:12.22]Okay, okay.
[132:28.93]No, she holds him up.
[132:30.55]And then...
[132:42.67]Oh, that's fucking funny.
[132:49.09]It's a neutral novice.
[132:52.85]Cool.
[132:53.26]She's gonna do it real cool.
[132:55.32]Yeah, you know, you bet you'll be ready.
[132:58.94]Yeah.
[133:02.58]Which then in turn, he's smoking a cigarette.
[133:10.12]No, the train's just going.
[133:12.50]Can't do any changes to that.
[133:15.63]And then... What happens here?
[133:24.11]What?
[133:26.83]Where the hell is he?
[133:33.89]What the fuck is going on?
[133:49.30]Okay, so then they have a critical talk.
[133:54.58]They have a nice critical talk about the upcoming problem.
[133:58.48]Mood.
[134:02.03]Argumentative.
[134:03.93]It's very abrupt.
[134:06.93]Chat and outcome, yep.
[134:08.15]Because it's like, I can't believe you didn't do that.
[134:11.39]I know.
[134:11.67]We've got to get out of here.
[134:14.33]How did you steal that briefcase without me?
[134:17.55]Yeah.
[134:18.54]Okay, then he gets up.
[134:20.72]Oh, shit.
[134:22.04]This is where we're getting real fucking intense here.
[134:24.22]Short.
[134:25.04]The train stops.
[134:26.40]He gets up.
[134:28.24]Subway.
[134:35.55]Where was it?
[134:37.99]Where was neck break?
[134:44.73]Incidental.
[134:45.25]What the hell is it?
[134:49.06]Fight.
[134:52.32]No.
[134:52.64]No, no, no.
[134:52.94]Wait, wait, wait.
[134:53.62]No, no.
[134:55.46]He's to sneak up and break the guy's neck.
[134:57.18]Okay.
[135:03.14]Sneak.
[135:03.64]Sneak up.
[135:06.26]Monster sneak.
[135:11.45]Okay.
[135:12.79]It's this guy.
[135:19.59]Uh, hello?
[135:20.65]Here we go.
[135:26.26]Let's see what we can do with this.
[135:27.44]He gets up.
[135:28.48]They're in the middle of their conversation.
[135:29.68]They don't notice that he's creeping by.
[135:31.90]Wait, who the fuck is this?
[135:35.04]Who the fuck is this person?
[135:39.54]No, I don't want two people.
[135:42.34]Monster is sexy.
[135:46.48]The train has already stopped.
[135:58.19]This person doesn't exist.
[135:59.41]Get the fuck out of here.
[136:03.55]I want him to sexually walk up.
[136:10.81]No, that's not gonna happen.
[136:13.85]Back to the drawing board.
[136:16.59]You gotta choose someone?
[136:18.14]Well, I don't want it to be anybody.
[136:19.60]I want him just to sneak up sexually and then break the guy's neck.
[136:29.57]Because you can change lighting, by the way.
[136:32.25]It gets real moody in here.
[136:36.93]Okay, well, let me go back to this.
[136:43.75]Sliders.
[136:46.07]Well, it looks like we can't do sexy.
[136:49.86]What is sad?
[136:50.46]Let's watch sad.
[137:00.46]Alright, no, we're keeping sexy.
[137:01.58]Fuck it.
[137:01.92]Who cares?
[137:02.24]Because then he sprints over and breaks the guy's neck.
[137:06.44]Okay, sneak up.
[137:23.76]I love how it's the same.
[137:27.40]It's the same.
[137:29.02]Oh god.
[137:30.40]Oh my god, I fucking love this shit.

[149:47.87]Yeah, okay.
[149:48.32]At least it's working.
[149:51.35]Dude, what really got me going, the thing that made me go over the edge is the fact that I didn't make an intro screen.
[149:56.15]So it was the same default fucking intro.
[149:59.23]For every single intro screen.
[150:01.31]I don't know why that got me going so much, but it did.
[150:03.69]My stomach is killing me.

[153:12.14]Well, that's... I don't know.
[153:13.24]Who knows how that movie's gonna turn out.
[153:15.08]It might be a piece of shit.
[153:17.21]Sure, we'll find out.
[153:20.22]But thanks a lot, guys.
[153:22.46]Let's get back to it.
[153:23.92]Much love.
[153:25.00]Oh, let's talk about Bloodborne.
[153:27.24]So I've beat Bloodborne like seven times or something.
[153:30.88]And I feel like... I love how you can kind of say... Why is there a clown?
[153:35.07]Why is there a clown?
[153:37.71]Why the fuck is there a clown?
[153:41.31]Who is this?
[153:45.27]Something went wrong here.
[153:47.75]Something went wrong.
[153:48.51]There's a clown here now.
[153:50.24]Wait, what?
[153:54.14]What?
[153:55.86]Okay.
[153:57.08]Apparently it's a clown.
[153:59.70]I guess.
[154:05.09]Thanks, Chrono Waster.
[154:06.59]For nine months.
[154:07.87]Little jermaRat Jr.
[154:13.71]The movie is fucking ruined.
[154:15.96]Where's the wolf?
[154:17.14]Where's the werewolf?
[154:19.98]What the fuck is this?
[154:21.62]Who is this person?
[154:26.36]Oh, God.
[154:27.08]I don't know what's going on over here.
[154:33.73]Something is not right.
[154:35.77]But we'll figure... I guess we'll see what happens in a minute.
[154:42.01]There better not be a fucking clown.
[154:43.63]There is.
[154:44.02]It was by mistake.
[154:47.22]Set the permanent costumes.
[154:48.26]We'll do it for the next one.
[154:52.11]Wait, can I just rip this off?
[154:53.35]This guy doesn't even have a fucking costume on!
[154:57.75]Hold on, hold on!

[155:24.32]What's going on?
[155:25.30]I'll return to set.
[155:26.46]What?
[155:26.94]The director is creating gaming liberties?
[155:28.74]Creative liberties?
[155:29.98]He's the robot costume.
[155:31.34]Maybe he's just being weird.
[155:32.12]Get back to the set, you fucking pieces of shit.

[157:01.67]This person has like a stomach ache.
[157:06.67]Should I fire this person?
[157:07.53]They're just walking around in circles.

[157:52.42]This guy's gonna get recasted here in a second.
[157:54.68]No, I forced him in there.
[157:58.26]Now he's practicing comedy.
[157:59.38]This guy's not even in the movie.
[158:10.47]Get up there.
[158:14.07]Return to the set.
[158:19.83]What are you idiots doing?
[158:24.66]Here goes the movie.
[158:25.68]Okay, is he gonna be... He's getting happier now that he's practicing.

[158:41.91]Alright, now you're ready to go.
[158:43.29]Let's do it, please.
[158:44.01]And thank you.

[159:03.24]What the fuck are you people doing?
[159:04.54]Cosmetic surgery?

[159:18.86]Am I doing something wrong here?
[159:22.70]Like, return to set.
[159:25.74]Just re-drag everybody in there?
[159:28.57]They're all having tantrums.
[159:33.49]Can they finish the fucking movie?
[159:37.74]This is so stupid.
[159:38.76]The same guy.
[159:39.98]Get the fuck out of here.
[159:44.83]Fuck you, you know what fuck you, too Let's get let's recast this fucking thing Where my other actors this guy you're now an actor here I Don't understand what's going on?
[160:14.54]Why is it shooting on hold?
[160:18.76]Do I have to, like, bring it?
[160:20.54]Like... What the fuck?
[160:23.86]What?
[160:28.66]I had to, like, drag it in that little circle?
[160:30.42]Oh my god.
[160:33.34]Who gives a shit?
[160:33.96]Those guys were having a tantrum anyways.
[160:37.88]I didn't even know that thing existed.
[160:42.65]It's alright, we're good.
[160:46.86]You're firing innocents.
[160:47.90]It's the script.
[160:51.08]The script is the thing.
[160:52.14]That's the problem.
[160:57.14]I thought it was on hold because one of the guys was having a tantrum and wouldn't go back to work.
[161:03.68]Alright, it's almost done.
[161:07.94]But, anyway, I'll talk about Bloodborne while this is going.
[161:12.16]So, I've beaten that game so many times that I feel like streaming that game, it would be me just kind of going through the motions playing it.
[161:23.51]And that's not like a terrible thing, but I'm not like speedrunning it or anything.
[161:26.99]And there's not going to be any big moments where I'm like, whoa, what the fuck is that?
[161:31.39]Because I like know everything.
[161:37.32]So maybe as a chill-out stream one day, I will beat it in a couple streams.
[161:44.12]Alright, it's almost done.
[161:46.07]We're gonna see our fucking awful masterpiece.
[161:51.09]With the two actors.
[161:53.29]Oh, hold on a second.
[161:54.31]I think I understand what's happening.
[161:56.40]So there's two actors.
[161:58.44]One of them's playing multiple characters.
[162:03.37]Okay, I get it.
[162:05.13]I understand.
[162:07.09]We can research some shit.
[162:09.70]What can we research?

[173:10.43]It's a bird though, it wasn't even a purple screaming.
[173:12.36]It wasn't even a purple, it wasn't even a purple scream.
[173:15.80]Oh, fuck me.
[173:21.36]That took... Look how long that movie took to make.

[173:33.59]That movie took four years.
[173:46.27]Wow.
[173:47.73]That's unbelievable.
[173:51.36]Oh, yeah, Andre Silva really let this movie down.
[173:56.50]God damn it.
[173:58.22]The acting was more painful than gouging out your eyes with a spoon.

[176:36.50]There we are.
[176:38.82]Right?
[176:40.32]No, this isn't like a person.
[176:42.40]I gotta give it like a role.

[176:46.38]Okay.

[176:51.87]The intro burps killed me.
[176:54.17]That whole thing was just a total train wreck.
[176:56.55]Alright, this is what our costume is going to be the whole time.
[177:01.31]Oh, god damn it.
[177:03.47]Why the fuck do you keep giving me these stupid costumes?
[177:07.05]I'm not going to make a real movie.
[177:09.89]But Polar Autumn 201.
[177:11.71]Thank you, Polar, for the 30 bucks.
[177:15.47]3,000 bits.
[177:15.69]That's very kind of you, dude.
[177:18.17]Let's see if we can make... People can follow up.
[177:22.23]Alright.
[177:22.47]It's going to be the ape.
[177:27.70]This guy in the stupid space suit.
[177:29.78]Oh, that's so... No, this one.
[177:32.20]No.
[177:32.64]Space...

[177:44.90]Marsh creature.
[177:46.82]No, no.
[177:47.20]Just everyone's an ape.
[177:49.56]They're all fucking apes.
[177:50.42]Who cares?
[177:50.94]Except now I gotta change the color.
[177:56.52]Can I change the color?
[177:57.32]I don't think I can.
[178:00.35]Well, at least there's two different apes.

[203:31.22]Is this another double cross?
[203:37.40]Hold on, wait a second.
[203:43.55]Beating extreme.
[203:50.03]These two are working together the whole time.

[203:54.53]Oh.
[204:01.66]Alright, horrific.
[204:03.42]What's horrific?
[204:08.04]I kind of want this guy just to be like a dinosaur or something.
[204:13.57]Okay, hold on.
[204:27.25]This guy needs to be in a costume.
[204:34.15]No, he can't.
[204:34.75]No, no fucking costume for this guy.
[204:37.52]God damn it.
[204:38.58]Now it's just off the fucking rails.
[204:43.08]This is supposed to be apes.
[204:50.17]Okay, now.

[205:25.91]She gets up.
[205:28.45]She's fine.
[205:30.45]Mm-hmm.
[205:33.57]Not a scratch on her.

[205:39.33]Is she dead?
[205:39.71]Who knows?
[205:39.97]Is this, like, a dream?
[205:40.73]Could this be a dream?
[205:53.10]No, there's no, like, getting fucking hit by a car.
[206:00.84]This is where she walks with the axe.
[206:07.92]Yep, there we go.

[209:10.51]Okay, wait.
[209:11.15]Who gets beat up here?
[209:12.29]I don't remember.
[209:19.45]It's a double twist.
[209:20.33]Alright, so it would be this guy.
[209:22.62]He would be answering the door.
[209:30.12]Oh shit, a twist!
[209:32.40]Turns out she was dead the whole time!
[209:34.14]Okay, and then, uh... No, shit, this guy's dead.
[209:46.33]I'm confusing my plotlines.
[209:55.19]Okay, now they're gonna celebrate and regain consciousness again.
[210:03.89]It was like happy conversation.
[210:08.31]And now they're going to admire the baby.

[210:20.96]Now he's in like a different outfit again.
[210:22.28]Okay.
[210:35.36]And then, wait a second.
[210:36.32]You thought she was actually dead.
[210:37.40]She's not dead.
[210:46.11]This movie's gonna be like fucking two hours long.
[210:48.27]I thought he was the baby.
[210:51.45]Oh shit, we have major plot holes.

[221:01.88]Where is she?
[221:08.12]What are you doing?
[221:10.32]How do I get there again?
[221:13.15]How do I just get to the salary menu?
[221:17.69]I know there's a way to do it.
[221:23.39]Finances?
[221:24.03]Where is that?
[221:28.53]12 years in Ape?
[221:31.87]The world passes by.
[221:37.73]Isn't that an actual movie?
[221:43.58]It's gonna take like 12 years to make this fucking movie.
[221:47.18]Uh, what is this?
[221:58.37]You still pissed off?
[222:06.70]Where's the fucking financial menu?
[222:13.63]Oh, I thought he was making a reference to, like, how long the video was gonna take to make.
[222:17.57]Like, we were talking about the movie was gonna take, like, years to make.
[222:20.91]Is everything all built?
[222:38.63]It's in the... Finances is in a building.

[222:59.11]Who cares?
[222:59.43]It's sandbox mode.
[223:03.60]Jerma racist.
[223:05.88]I'm sorry.
[223:06.88]I got like...
[223:08.81]That's not what I meant by that.
[223:10.39]I hope you all know that.
[223:16.27]I thought, like I said, he was referencing the fucking, like, time it was gonna take to make this movie.
[223:22.84]It's my absent-minded stupidness, and I'm sorry about that.
[223:27.62]So let's go... I think we're ready to go.
[223:30.28]Attention.
[223:32.06]An actor is needed in the casting office.
[223:37.50]I need an actor?
[223:38.56]Who the fuck else do I need?
[223:50.75]Role unassigned?
[223:51.73]Who's the other role?
[223:54.14]Somebody quit?
[223:55.30]I don't understand.
[224:01.04]I have to recast her?
[224:02.16]That was dumb.
[224:06.99]Okay.
[224:15.68]Alright, it's ready to go, right?

[224:42.95]I just want to see the 8 movie.
[224:45.25]So do I. It's gonna seriously be like a 25-year movie.
[224:48.64]Or like a 10-year movie.
[224:49.80]Think about it.
[224:50.32]If this movie was like...
[225:04.18]10 years long.
[225:06.54]The last one that we just did was like less than two minutes and it took like fucking four years.
[225:11.56]This is going to take 30 fucking years to make this movie.
[225:29.77]Eat during shoot.
[225:32.17]Getting drunk.
[225:32.85]Getting drunk.
[225:33.43]Oh, come on, you guys.

[227:05.53]Is the ape movie spinoff of rat movie?
[227:07.23]I'm not sure what the fuck it is.
[227:08.31]We're gonna do a lot of post-production of this, don't worry.
[227:14.21]Somebody's getting drunk again?
[227:16.30]Where the fuck are they going?

[228:12.13]So, OK, well, we might as well.
[228:18.01]What the fuck?
[228:18.71]Throwing a tantrum.

[228:37.73]What is the actual time that this movie took to make?
[228:39.69]More than 10 years?
[228:54.74]20 years?
[228:55.78]I'm gonna say it's gonna take... 14 or 15 years.
[229:05.09]9 years?
[229:11.35]So can we... Can we expect this to release the day after Half-Life 3?
[229:16.19]Just look at the top left!

[229:20.88]It ain't even close!
[229:23.58]Control my actors.

[229:26.30]They're like frantic.
[229:29.80]Get in there.
[229:30.56]Oh, you're going to get recast.
[229:36.64]How many years has it been already?
[229:37.78]It's been at least two or three.
[229:46.21]This person is in such a bad mood.
[229:54.06]Yeah, well, you're right.
[229:56.16]Clean up the fucking trash.
[230:02.53]Get in there.

[230:07.09]I'm okay with that.
[230:10.51]Be wary of the recasting.
[230:11.69]You're gonna get clowns.

[230:22.78]But what this proves to me is this.
[230:25.92]Tomorrow, I kind of want to get the expansion to have more like things.
[230:31.20]Because in the expansion, correct me if I'm wrong, there's like explosions and stunts.
[230:36.87]There's a bunch of crazy shit you can do in the expansion, right?
[230:39.73]And can't you move the camera around freely in the expansion?

[236:32.32]Where is it?
[236:32.78]I fucking went by it again, didn't I?
[236:56.67]This guy's got me all kinds of mad right now.
[236:59.69]No, where the fuck is it?
[237:01.31]That's his... Starring studio with mainstream packs?
[237:06.44]Cult packs?
[237:09.90]Where the fuck is it?
[237:12.26]I wish I could zoom out more.
[237:13.20]I thought it was down here.
[237:20.86]Wait a minute.
[237:21.28]You just stand still for a second.
[237:22.64]Where the fuck is it?
[237:27.36]Is this it?
[237:29.32]Production office?
[237:31.84]There it is, lower right.
[237:36.89]Alright, get the fuck in that costume.
[237:38.47]Alright, which one was it?
[237:46.59]Oh, fuck, which one was it?
[237:47.95]I think it was this one, right?
[237:49.71]There.
[237:51.45]He hates these costumes!
[237:53.71]God damn it, he's gonna be in one scene without the costume on.
[238:03.78]Oh my god.
[238:05.22]God damn it.
[238:06.78]In one of these little scenes.
[238:10.30]Shit.
[238:14.18]Stay here.
[238:19.63]Finish the fucking movie.
[238:22.41]You're not even halfway done.
[238:26.19]Oh my god.
[238:26.89]Where are you going?
[238:28.27]You're not even allowed to go to the bathroom where I am.
[238:31.38]This movie made a... Oh, by the way, Train Days 9 made $170,000.
[238:34.08]If you were curious, it made some money.
[238:41.95]I need to... What do I need to do?
[238:47.93]Archive.
[238:49.77]Back here.
[238:52.79]Yep.
[238:53.79]Now you're upset.
[238:54.77]I understand.
[239:00.88]The director is seriously crazy.
[239:03.99]Hey, we got a hundred million dollars.
[239:04.99]We're fine.
[239:12.53]Who's missing?
[239:14.98]No, where are you all going?
[239:16.94]Oh, new scene.
[239:17.56]Okay, good, good.
[239:18.40]We're done there.
[239:18.84]Now we're moving on to the next place.
[239:20.68]Good.
[239:21.36]Whoa.
[239:26.77]Like I said before, I don't care if I have to force them to work.
[239:29.37]Like, this lady seriously just wants to go get a drink.
[239:32.57]Every time.
[239:32.99]Who are we waiting for now?
[239:43.36]Who the hell is this?
[239:44.40]Oh, right, that's the extra.
[239:45.54]Okay.
[239:47.23]Alright, we're almost there.
[239:48.05]Fucking 25 years later.
[239:51.40]I should have done, like, instant building.
[239:55.34]Can I, like, still do that?
[239:57.14]Game options?
[239:59.36]Auto-save, max... No, that's too bad.
[240:01.82]I should have done that.
[240:08.39]Even on fast-forward, we're, like, just about halfway done.
[240:16.47]Six years so far.
[240:22.71]Now where are we going?
[240:24.23]I don't think he's in this scene, is he?
[240:26.79]I don't think so.
[240:32.48]Okay, now here we go.
[240:33.20]He had to get changed.
[240:35.18]Save it.
[240:35.70]He got it.
[240:37.66]Thanks for the reminder.
[240:42.18]Almost there.
[240:48.06]I've been watching this stream for six years.
[240:50.28]I know, right?
[240:59.46]Alright, next scene.
[241:02.51]Everybody is not happy, but don't care.
[241:09.75]Get in here.
[241:10.35]Here comes the extra.
[241:20.63]Save the game again?
[241:21.43]No.
[241:21.75]We're almost at the end.
[241:27.20]I'm getting sleepy.
[241:30.50]This'll be worth it.
[241:31.36]This is gonna be worth it.
[241:32.22]Don't worry.
[241:33.32]It's gonna change the world.
[241:37.62]The years pass us by.
[241:42.49]Oh shit, the director's gonna quit.
[241:43.57]It's alright, I'll just get a new director.
[241:46.33]Fuck this lady.
[241:50.98]You think I care?
[241:52.09]You're easily replaceable.
[242:01.19]It takes a month for an actor to walk around.
[242:05.28]Seriously.
[242:07.48]Alright, so what do we... Let's talk about something.
[242:09.46]Let's have like a discussion.
[242:13.26]Threatening to quit.
[242:14.32]Are you threatening to quit again?
[242:16.44]That's cute.
[242:26.60]Make a documentary on the making of this film.
[242:29.81]Only got 14 scenes to shoot.
[242:35.60]Can I like save this script or something and like do it instantly off?
[242:39.10]I wish I wasn't an idiot and didn't do this.
[242:49.69]Alright.
[242:51.13]Getting there slowly but surely.
[242:53.45]Even if they quit.
[242:55.01]Guys, even if they quit, who cares?
[242:56.75]Who cares?
[242:57.17]They can just... One random person can get in a fucking gorilla costume.
[243:00.10]Doesn't matter.
[243:08.84]Did anybody do anything?
[243:12.61]How come they're not moving?
[243:14.03]They weren't moving at all.
[243:18.34]I love how it freezes when it loads like the next frame.
[243:20.44]What are we waiting for?
[243:24.05]Alright.
[243:29.87]22 out of 34.
[243:30.73]Only getting close to 10 scenes remaining.
[243:32.67]It's been daytime for seven years.
[243:42.30]If it spreads, our boys will go in and purge the pinko threat in minutes, stated one cautious government spokesman when pressed on how long a war could last.
[243:53.13]This person's gonna quit.
[243:56.13]Can we get all of them done before she quits?
[244:01.05]Come on.
[244:01.49]What, a new scene?
[244:03.79]Where are we going?
[244:05.25]Shit, she's gonna quit here.
[244:06.81]Get back here.
[244:08.89]Where's the next scene?
[244:12.96]Going to get a drink.
[244:13.72]Where's the next scene?
[244:15.89]This way.
[244:16.53]Get over here.
[244:24.13]You too.
[244:25.43]Aren't you supposed to be here?
[244:32.05]Get over here.
[244:35.87]Okay, good.
[244:37.86]Who are we filming?
[244:39.54]Oh, right.
[244:40.06]When she gets up.
[244:41.38]Cue the fog.
[244:42.00]Cue the fog.
[244:44.24]She's about to quit.
[244:44.82]I need a new director.
[244:45.96]This guy.
[244:48.60]This guy's going to be the new director immediately.
[244:53.48]Watch this.
[244:53.84]Ready?
[244:55.00]Oh, that's cute.
[244:59.37]Oh, that's cute.
[245:00.43]Like three times now.
[245:01.63]Should I give her a trailer?
[245:11.48]No.
[245:11.72]What should I do with her?
[245:13.93]It's under the bar.
[245:14.75]Get fired.
[245:15.87]I can't fire her.
[245:21.25]I can't fire her.
[245:27.64]Why can't I fire her?
[245:28.56]Yeah, go get... Hey, you go get plastic surgery now.
[245:33.84]Maybe that'll make you feel better.
[245:41.52]And while you're at it... Hey, new director.
[245:45.13]How do I like Adam?
[245:50.86]Alright, how funny would it be if she came out in a gorilla suit?
[245:58.18]I better not have just given her free plastic surgery before she leaves.
[246:04.51]Alright.
[246:06.57]Please come out in a gorilla suit.
[246:10.65]Please.
[246:10.95]No.
[246:14.86]Alright, cool.
[246:16.96]Your image is... You don't like your image still.
[246:19.02]Mo, go get a makeover then.
[246:24.00]Go get yourself a makeover.
[246:25.04]Hurry, before she quits.
[246:29.98]This person is just still here.
[246:37.66]Oh my god, cool.
[246:41.90]We're getting there.
[246:42.54]Our magnum opus is almost done.
[246:45.00]She just wanted to have a shorter skirt.
[246:51.71]Image has improved.
[246:56.37]Threatening to quit still.
[246:57.41]She's stressed out.
[246:58.95]Go do what you do best.
[247:00.30]Go to the bar.
[247:03.36]Go to the VIP bar.
[247:07.54]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[247:08.54]You're having fun.
[247:09.32]If you don't, you quit on me.
[247:13.81]It says she quit and not wait away.
[247:17.03]Hold on a second.
[247:19.68]She's threatening to quit on the 25th of August, 1963.
[247:25.50]She's like a year late.
[247:35.48]She's late.
[247:42.80]She wanted to quit a year ago.
[247:44.26]Are you still threatening to quit?
[247:50.98]Ah, God.
[247:54.61]I don't like this.
[247:55.25]I don't like this.
[247:55.91]I don't like this.
[247:57.83]You just were at the bar.
[247:58.99]Yeah, sunshine and rainbow is flying out of you.
[248:05.02]Nice empty threat.
[248:08.70]I don't know why I find that so funny.
[248:09.98]That's fucking hilarious.
[248:12.06]She's still gonna quit.
[248:14.14]She's still... She's doing okay now.
[248:15.51]Come on.
[248:16.03]Get your bar filled up.
[248:20.91]You can probably pause it to drop them between sets so they can't quit before the film's done.
[248:25.71]Oh, man.
[248:26.21]That's funny.
[248:26.67]Alright.
[248:26.87]She's no longer gonna threaten to quit.
[248:29.34]So... Get over here.
[248:31.94]Go back to fucking work.
[248:34.68]But thank you, cigarette, for the...
[248:37.23]For the 1,000 bits.
[248:38.71]Thanks a lot, dude.
[248:39.27]Much appreciated.
[248:41.73]Where are you?
[248:43.17]You're threatening to quit.
[248:44.85]Alright, this person was gonna quit on November 21st, 1960.
[248:50.06]Which was four years ago.
[248:53.68]This person was even worse.
[248:57.62]Alright.
[249:00.66]I guess that's... These are very empty threats.
[249:10.55]I'm gonna do it.
[249:11.39]I'm telling you.
[249:12.15]This time I'm gonna do it.
[249:13.45]I'm gonna quit.
[249:15.25]It's like, okay, yeah, yeah, whatever, Gary.
[249:17.08]You're gonna quit.
[249:17.66]You sure are.
[249:22.96]Who are we waiting for?
[249:24.18]Get over here.
[249:25.16]Who else?
[249:31.26]Okay, you can just stand around.
[249:32.72]Almost there.
[249:35.70]Less than ten.
[249:36.36]Nine more scenes to shoot.
[249:42.74]We got, like, burps to add and sound effects to add, too.
[249:45.26]God damn it.
[249:51.23]Yeah, force them.
[249:51.97]I mean, I feel like I bugged something out.
[249:55.41]Where they were supposed to quit, but I just kept forcing them to work, so they didn't, um... Didn't stop and didn't quit when they were supposed to.
[250:04.06]Alright, yeah.
[250:07.96]Get back over here.
[250:10.96]Yeah, the actors have been trying to quit for the entire movie.
[250:14.60]Oddly enough.
[250:15.18]Bring this baby into post-production.
[250:18.41]Add the shit we need to add.
[250:37.50]And we're gonna get... I bet this is probably gonna be three stars.
[250:39.62]We got multiple locations.
[250:42.08]There's like four locations in this movie.
[250:44.42]This isn't just on a fucking train.
[250:47.72]This is... Go clean up... Oh, shit.
[250:50.01]I just made that secondary direct to clean up trash and now he's gonna quit.
[250:53.35]Got threatened to quit.
[250:55.43]Come on.
[250:55.69]Come here.
[250:57.85]Any more trash in the park for you to pick up?
[251:00.73]You gonna quit?
[251:02.81]Hmm?
[251:05.58]Hmm, I don't see any more trash for you to pick up.
[251:08.78]You know, like, fucking scrub the floor in this, like, dirty bathroom.
[251:11.78]I'm a director!
[251:14.33]This is bullshit!
[251:15.11]I have to paint the side of a building?
[251:16.65]I'm a visionary award winner!
[251:18.71]I swear to God, I'm gonna quit in January of 1962!
[251:20.71]Fuck out of here.
[251:29.60]Nope, no you don't.
[251:35.79]Save the game?
[251:36.47]Okay.
[251:39.30]Doesn't the game automatically save every 15 minutes?
[251:47.34]We're almost done.
[251:49.04]Almost done.
[251:53.58]So, how many years do we have so far?
[251:56.36]Has it been 8?
[251:57.72]7?
[252:03.62]Still sparkling.
[252:09.99]15 minutes is two years.
[252:11.01]Oh, those, the big, these big hangups.
[252:22.40]Every time it does a scene, it freezes and I'm just, I get terrified that it's going to freeze and crash.
[252:26.58]Six years.
[252:40.44]It's a wrap, but not for you.
[252:45.06]Final four scenes.
[252:50.26]Then we get to see the fruits of the labor.
[252:58.12]When you stay up to watch a movie in a video game in a live stream.
[253:04.65]So for next time, for tomorrow night, I'm going to make it instant.
[253:07.29]We're going to do the instant movie making thing.
[253:11.70]Because we've been spending a majority of the time waiting for them.
[253:14.57]You know, these people to complain and tell me that they're going to fucking quit.
[253:18.81]What are you doing?
[253:19.29]Get out of here.
[253:22.75]Almost done.
[253:23.73]What does this mean?
[253:25.01]Action?
[253:25.31]Okay, good.
[253:29.21]It's going to get like three or four stars.
[253:32.33]The game's like dumb 2005 AI.
[253:33.39]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[253:37.41]What are you doing?
[253:38.03]What are you doing?
[253:38.53]What are you doing?
[253:38.97]What are you doing?
[253:39.47]What are you doing?
[253:40.03]Why are you in this costume?
[253:42.74]What the fuck is this?
[253:43.72]Why are you in this costume?
[253:46.91]Oh, God damn it.
[253:49.55]No, that's... You got in the wrong costume.
[253:53.53]This is gonna be all fucked up.
[254:06.06]Two more scenes.
[254:10.00]The stupid, like, 2005 AI is gonna be like, oh, you changed scenes four times.
[254:15.60]And you had four actors do different moves.
[254:18.27]This is a 10 out of 10 movie.
[254:21.40]PurpleRoseTattoo, thank you for the sub.
[254:23.98]MiguelMeanGreenBenElnor.

[255:05.54]There's one more scene to shoot.
[255:07.62]Where is it?
[255:08.54]Oh, fuck, it's in the dumb jail.
[255:13.10]Okay.
[255:14.56]Thank you, Toddy Knows for the 500.
[255:17.76]Also, can we just acknowledge that this is a very well-made game?
[255:21.81]It is.
[255:23.69]This is an 11-year-old game.
[255:27.01]And this 11-year-old game feels like it's a pretty current game.
[255:32.22]Just judging by the world building and scene building and stuff.
[255:37.38]Where's this guy going?
[255:40.54]Is that it?
[255:41.04]33 out of 34 scenes?
[255:41.88]34 scenes done.
[255:43.82]We're done.
[255:45.32]This nightmare is over.
[255:48.82]No, it's not.
[255:49.69]What's left?
[255:51.80]Finalized shooting.
[255:52.76]Yeah, the last scene.
[255:56.20]Get it done.
[255:58.20]But no, thanks a lot, guys.
[256:07.49]Hey, PBBullet, thanks for the sub, dude.
[256:09.75]Final scene.
[256:11.05]It's almost over.
[256:11.83]The nightmare is almost over.
[256:15.66]Save it.
[256:20.51]Bring it to post-production, baby.
[256:26.77]Time to edit it up.
[256:29.83]There it is.
[256:30.69]Yes!

[258:16.33]Anymore?
[258:19.99]There we go.
[258:20.65]That's what I was saying.
[258:38.85]These sound effects sound like they're voiced by me.
[258:41.49]That would be fucking hilarious.
[258:42.59]Alright, I'm running out of room here.
[258:52.56]One more sound.
[259:06.94]And we need a long scream.
[259:13.44]There's a shitload of screaming females, but there's only one or two male screams.

[260:04.64]That's good.
[260:05.26]We can drag this back a little bit with the trimming tool.
[260:10.12]How do I delete this?
[260:17.47]There we go.
[260:21.61]No, what?
[260:22.39]No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[260:29.43]Okay, well, that has to stay.
[260:31.09]That has to stay.
[260:35.53]How do I just... I want to drag this.

[260:45.30]How do I just cut this?
[260:51.25]Bad movie.
[260:55.15]How do I just get rid of this?
[261:00.01]This is going to be such a piece of shit.
[261:01.44]I can't wait.
[261:03.36]Right here, the neck, the music that is to change.
[261:08.16]Can you add an R to the kiss?
[261:10.32]I'm going to.
[261:10.86]Don't worry.
[261:11.30]I'm going to add more sounds.
[261:12.81]How do I trim shit?
[261:14.53]Drag from the end.
[261:15.41]Really?
[261:15.67]Didn't seem to really do anything.
[261:20.44]That just seems to move it around.
[261:21.66]Yeah, that's just like dragging it back and forth.
[261:34.60]Okay, ready?
[261:35.00]I'll drag the right end.
[261:35.86]Watch, ready?
[261:37.20]It just moves it.
[261:48.53]Can you stop the movie?
[261:50.27]Maybe.
[261:52.09]The movie is stopped.
[261:57.35]Record your own voice?
[261:58.21]I don't think I can.
[261:58.95]Yeah, I think it's like an old ass game.
[262:16.56]Scissor only affects the video.
[262:19.98]Playing a new song will stop the previous one.
[262:22.10]Alright, so what if I just do this?
[262:25.04]This needs to be like a scary song.
[262:37.80]So it opens the door here, right?
[263:00.83]Okay.
[263:01.27]I need to add, like, an aw.
[263:08.29]Wait, what?
[263:17.04]Fuck.
[263:17.50]It's gonna get all fucked up from here.

[263:46.62]I know.
[263:46.98]Now we need to add... Right here.
[263:58.64]That's not a chicken.
[263:59.40]That's not a chicken.
[264:00.34]This is a guy doing a chicken.
[264:02.40]Holy fuck, that's awful.
[264:05.53]That's a guy making a chicken noise.
[264:16.19]He's got flowers in his hand.
[264:22.17]I forgot about the shotgun.
[264:26.89]Okay, hold on a second.
[264:29.07]We need some different music.
[264:51.94]Okay, hold on.
[265:02.56]No, I didn't want to put that there.
[265:16.57]Ow!
[265:16.97]Fuck, I'm sorry!

[265:37.94]See, like, record dialog.
[265:41.28]I can't, like, press it.
[265:42.28]Wait, what?
[265:43.30]It doesn't let me do it.
[265:50.34]But thank you, Killick Rockemeier.
[265:53.51]These sounds of pushing it on.
[265:54.89]Wait, wait, wait.
[265:55.39]This is important.
[265:59.96]God, you guys are going to think I'm a fucking child here.
[266:19.94]God, you got this is this is so fucking childish.
[266:33.85]What a fucking little boy.
[266:35.70]There's a fart noise when she moves back and forth.
[267:06.42]Fuck, she moves back like two more goddamn times.
[267:08.58]I'm spending so much time on this.
[267:34.55]Like right there, she shits her pants.
[267:38.51]That was the last straw.
[267:47.48]Wait, they're fucking kissing?
[267:48.80]What the fuck is the... What is happening here?
[267:59.11]Almost done.
[267:59.69]We're getting there.
[268:10.20]Okay, one more song, and that's going to be a wrap.
[268:27.32]We need... I don't even know.
[268:31.34]Will this work?
[268:36.55]What else is there?
[268:37.37]I need like a fucking horror sound here.
[269:07.64]Alright, let's just fucking watch this piece of shit.
[269:13.32]Let's just watch this fucking pile of crap.
[269:32.15]Wait, I'm so confused right now.
[269:36.06]Does anybody remember what happened here?
[269:39.36]I don't know what fucking happened.
[269:44.68]Something got really fucked up here, and I don't know what it was.
[269:49.76]But, uh, okay.
[269:52.69]I'm gonna do all-out action.
[269:57.53]We're done.
[269:58.47]That's it.
[269:59.59]Print it.
[270:00.75]Print it.
[270:01.91]Print it.
[270:02.77]Save.
[270:05.22]Yep.
[270:05.90]Okay.
[270:09.48]Here we go.
[270:10.12]You guys ready for the masterpiece?
[270:11.84]I just moved something.
[270:12.66]I don't know what it was.
[270:16.83]Let's go.
[270:18.33]Movie has been saved.
[270:21.05]Let's release it.
[270:24.85]If this doesn't go on YouTube, I'm going to climb in my dryer and turn it on.
[270:29.23]Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's been like two hours since
[270:33.96]But let's see what happens with the years pass us by.
[270:37.96]Ape Edition.
[270:45.18]Two stars?
[270:45.84]Is script quality?
[270:49.19]Come on.
[270:50.63]Fuck.
[270:52.61]It's bad.
[270:54.09]It's bad.
[270:54.87]Alright, here we go.
[270:55.87]Turn your fucking volume up.
[271:21.52]Ha-ha!
[271:51.82]That's a good girl.
[272:19.52]Mm-hmm.
[272:54.81]Well, alright.
[272:55.83]Wonder when that happens.
[272:57.37]Wait.
[273:10.17]It's the wrong actor.
[273:13.39]It's the wrong actor.
[273:15.96]What is it?
[273:16.52]Well, alright.
[273:17.26]Wonder when that happens.
[273:25.09]Well, alright.
[273:26.62]I'm going to let her go.
[273:29.45]I just want to know.
[273:51.52]Damn it.
[273:53.88]Broke him out of jail.
[273:55.38]He's got a knife!
[274:31.30]This is fucking music.
[274:42.99]This is music.
[275:03.56]No.
[275:04.14]No.
[275:33.94]It's a different game.
[275:36.14]What?
[275:39.00]What?
[275:39.23]I didn't even make this.
[275:41.65]I didn't do this shit.
[275:43.29]I didn't even make that.
[275:45.31]God damn it.
[276:24.41]How does it end?
[276:28.72]I don't even remember.
[276:51.18]God damn it.
[276:52.00]That was fucking amazing.
[276:57.16]God.
[277:04.33]I did not think this game was going to make me laugh as hard as it has.
[277:09.05]But man, that's fucking funny.
[277:12.48]They're going the wrong way and shit.
[277:14.36]Like people walking in the scene at the wrong time.
[277:17.54]Extra scenes that didn't need to be there.
[277:19.42]I fucked up something when the ape slipped on the banana peel.
[277:24.84]Oh, I'm gonna fucking throw up.
[277:27.63]Alright, 92 months.
[277:30.77]That's like fucking almost 10 years.
[277:37.87]Production cost.
[277:38.61]This cost $422,000. $422,000.
[277:44.18]I hope you're happy.
[277:44.76]You killed me with laughter.
[277:45.86]Dude, I could have died right there too.
[277:53.44]Put them all on YouTube.
[278:01.53]That's seven.
[278:02.17]That's almost eight years.
[278:11.54]Well, that was a journey.
[278:15.36]A solid film that's unlikely to enjoy much box-off.
[278:18.02]Look, it's one of those cult classic movies.
[278:22.88]I'm not even kidding.
[278:23.60]I'm probably gonna, like, diarrhea later.
[278:25.46]Because, like, my stomach hurts so much.
[278:29.62]I'm gonna, like, shit my pants in an hour.
[278:35.70]Well, here it is.
[278:36.58]Let's see how much money it makes.
[278:39.42]It's kind of killing it right now, actually.
[278:46.98]But I think... I think I'm gonna call it there.
[278:50.60]Because that seriously killed me.
[278:52.20]I need to go take like a break.
[278:54.72]Ugh.
[279:00.59]This is gonna make like a million dollars.
[279:05.41]My word hurt.
[279:06.69]First of all... Uh, thanks to... All you guys giving these bits.
[279:12.48]Jeez, man.
[279:12.92]Renegade Coaster 1500 bits.
[279:15.14]That's literally the hardest I've ever left.
[279:18.22]Well, you're welcome.
[279:19.44]It's this game.
[279:20.26]It's this fucking game, man.
[279:21.35]It's the movies.
[279:24.09]There's an expansion of Deathly.
[279:25.61]Absolutely going to stream this tomorrow with the expansion.
[279:27.75]Going to go all night?
[279:32.49]Well, it's midnight.
[279:33.85]That's all night.
[279:34.47]You're the fucking devil.
[279:36.75]Oh, jeez.
[279:36.99]Yeah, there's no way.
[279:49.57]There's absolutely no way I'm not going to play this game tomorrow night with the expansion.
[279:53.71]We're going to make another fucking outrageous movie.
[279:56.31]The expansion adds a ton of shit, apparently.
[280:02.05]But thank you so much.
[280:03.07]Cigarette spaghetti, a thousand fucking dollars.
[280:06.67]A hundred dollars, ten thousand bits.
[280:09.43]Damn, dude, thank you.
[280:11.30]Doctor recommended 500 bits.
[280:12.50]Thanks a lot, man.
[280:15.02]You guys are spoiling me right now.
[280:19.67]Thank you Grimman342 for the 1500.
[280:23.40]Much appreciated, dude.
[280:25.66]Oh, that was fun.
[280:27.66]Renegade Coaster with the 1500.
[280:29.66]Did you do it twice?
[280:31.28]You gave a lot of money, man.
[280:33.94]Tender Taco, 500 bits.
[280:35.40]Grimman for 500 earlier.
[280:37.83]Big Marsh 213, 1000 bits.
[280:40.45]God is dead.
[280:41.35]Jesus.
[280:45.13]Cigarette Spaghetti with 1000 again.
[280:49.28]Crockemeyer with 1,500.
[280:50.99]Thanks a lot, man.
[280:52.93]I gotta find a way.
[280:53.75]By tomorrow, I'm gonna figure out how to put my own dialog in the movie.
[280:56.93]We'll make something stupid.
[280:58.77]Hand Shoes, thanks for the 500.
[281:01.45]Much appreciated, dude.
[281:03.45]You gotta be pretty immature to not laugh at a fart joke.
[281:05.89]Well, it's just the way that they were placed.
[281:08.29]It's just so out of... There's no reason for it.
[281:13.49]But thank you, guys.
[281:17.20]Burt Glick, thanks for two months.
[281:19.03]Crutherford for two months as well.
[281:21.71]XXFishy for seven months.
[281:22.99]MrDuckPlays for nine months.
[281:25.53]Thanks for the great streams and the great laughs.
[281:26.99]Well, thanks for sticking around, man.
[281:29.46]That's a lot of consecutive time in a row to be subbed to a channel.
[281:32.62]So thanks, MrDuck.
[281:34.42]The AmeriMan for six months.
[281:37.92]Meep617 for ten months.
[281:40.27]PBBullet, thanks for the new sub.
[281:43.68]And that's where I'm going to call it.
[281:45.56]Because I need to go take a break.
[281:47.66]Because seriously, the first one was funny.
[281:50.30]The second one was really funny.
[281:52.80]That one just put me over the fucking edge.
[281:54.72]This game is amazing.
[281:57.94]I'm so glad that... This was a heavily requested game by a few people that were in the chat.
[282:03.98]And... I'm saving, don't worry.
[282:07.88]You hit the nail on the head.
[282:09.24]This was a perfect game to play.
[282:11.71]So for tomorrow, 7 p.m.
[282:13.71]Eastern Time.
[282:15.35]I'll see you guys all there.
[282:18.12]I went for about five hours.
[282:20.70]The stream turned off for some weird reason.
[282:22.40]I have no idea why.
[282:23.26]I wish I could tell you why the stream just cut off after an hour of playing.
[282:29.39]I don't know.
[282:31.21]But have a good night, guys.
[282:32.15]I'll see you tomorrow with the expansion to the movies and another stream.
[282:38.33]So, much love.
[282:40.21]Respect.
[282:41.05]Peace.
[282:42.08]You know how it works.
[282:43.66]See you guys tomorrow.
[282:46.60]Yeah, that's a cut.
[282:47.82]That's a cut.
