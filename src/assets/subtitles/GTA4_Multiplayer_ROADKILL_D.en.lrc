[00:05.61]Why do we all have berets on?
[00:08.05]Who is shooting at me?
[00:11.17]Why do all three of us have berets?
[00:13.41]We're like triplets.
[00:19.64]Why is he shooting me?
[00:20.78]Oh, I have a star.
[00:23.92]My apologies.
[00:26.86]Oh, I was diced.
[00:28.20]I can't believe we're the same character.
[00:30.61]I'm pretty sure I was me before you were you.
[00:33.63]Hey, well, we could be like... I customize this many times.
[00:37.31]Oh, get in.
[00:37.83]It's alright, Etalyx.
[00:41.81]I don't think the cops want you.
[00:43.81]I don't want this cop.
[00:44.45]This cop's gonna pull me out of the car.
[00:47.07]What's with that rag doll?
[00:48.25]Will you let us in?
[00:49.43]You guys have to beat the cop.
[00:53.17]Let me in.
[00:55.87]What?
[00:57.88]Now this is all for nothing.
[01:00.48]How do you fist fight?
[01:02.34]What's going on?
[01:02.86]What is he doing?
[01:04.30]I took a swing.
[01:05.86]I took a wild swing at Jerma accident because I couldn't figure out how to fist fight.
[01:11.93]Oh, man.
[01:12.35]Maybe it's because we're trying to get into a police car right now.
[01:15.11]That might have something to do with it.
[01:15.93]I don't know.
[01:16.27]I took a random swing at you and I had a star.
[01:19.14]I think I see what you mean about these beret things.
[01:21.79]Yeah, why does everyone have a beret?
[01:26.45]I don't... Is that like a... Oh, I actually got out of the car.
[01:31.30]Is it like a server setting?
[01:32.54]Everyone gets a beret?
[01:37.92]Where are you guys?
[01:38.74]Get away from me!
[01:41.67]Get away from me!
[01:43.35]No!
[01:45.89]Oh yeah!
[01:48.13]That's what I'm talking about!
[01:53.84]Bridgeway explosion.
[01:57.64]You barely jumped down the rail.
[01:59.84]Beautiful aiming there.
[02:01.45]There's so many people over there.
[02:02.81]Oh, goodness!
[02:03.55]My face just ate the pavement.
[02:06.01]I didn't even see you there.
[02:07.11]I wasn't even looking that way.
[02:08.07]That was a very unfortunate positioning for you.
[02:11.59]Raymond Stereo from the top turnbuckle.
[02:13.43]Yeah, Jerma just threw me out the Royal Rumble.
[02:16.83]He just, like, catched me on the way down.
[02:18.84]What the?
[02:19.14]What was that?
[02:21.30]What's going on?
[02:22.74]No, no, I don't want to get in the backseat now.
[02:24.44]Why is this car exploding?
[02:25.68]Etalyx, are you shooting us from afar with an explosive sniper rifle?
[02:31.30]Who, me?
[02:33.80]This play session, explosions are Etalyx.
[02:36.09]Hey, I didn't kill you.
[02:37.13]I coulda.
[02:38.45]He's like posted up behind cover.
[02:40.47]This is what I think of your cover.
[02:43.31]Oh, God!
[02:45.91]Oh!
[02:46.91]Ow, that looks so painful on my side.
[02:49.45]Explosive bombs and a sniper rifle.
[02:51.37]I'm out of here.
[02:51.89]Ow!
[02:55.73]oh I survived I probably need like 50 stitches in my head but I'm alive hi Etalyx I see you have explosives in your hand I do I was aiming them downwind of Jerma run away oh no oh he got me even though I ran and stealth stood still
[03:17.00]I don't know how I missed, I missed like both of you guys somehow.
[03:20.58]Yeah, with my pickup that's closed for some reason.
[03:25.34]Sorry about your window.
[03:26.92]It's like elbow through the window.
[03:28.80]No big deal.
[03:30.26]Who's behind us?
[03:30.87]Hey, nice ride you got here.
[03:35.49]Who is this?
[03:35.97]Who is just sitting over here?
[03:37.93]That's Etalyx.
[03:39.11]Having some car trouble?
[03:40.25]Of course he has brakes.
[03:41.15]Oh no.
[03:45.14]Boo, get out!
[03:46.10]Don't die!
[03:46.48]Oh, you jumped out?
[03:47.44]Oh, I was hoping you were gonna deliver it back to him.
[03:50.90]Oh, I'll deliver something.
[03:53.27]I'll deliver something to him.
[03:56.39]Don't worry.
[03:56.87]Don't worry.
[03:57.37]Hey, guys!
[03:58.23]Oh, baby!
[03:58.55]Who's the enemy right now?
[04:00.73]Oh, my!
[04:03.25]What are you doing over there, Boo?
[04:07.17]He's like trying to give me a smoochie.
[04:08.53]How do you turn off?
[04:09.41]Oh!
[04:10.13]What?
[04:10.63]Watch out, Alex!
[04:12.51]Are you pinned?
[04:13.86]I died.
[04:15.10]Oh, you died?
[04:16.04]What happened?
[04:17.64]We got cops coming.
[04:19.28]I have stars.
[04:19.92]I think Boob definitely has stars.
[04:22.92]Nah.
[04:23.44]It's okay, officers.
[04:24.44]We have this under control.
[04:25.64]Go, go, go, go, go.
[04:29.28]We've captured him.
[04:30.02]It's alright.
[04:30.64]You can stop.
[04:32.18]Yeah, we got him.
[04:35.00]He's under arrest.
[04:38.70]Alright, so we're gonna start... Is this a jump?
[04:40.49]No, no, no, no.
[04:41.07]Wait for it.
[04:42.23]I gotta turn around and we gotta go around the way.
[04:44.29]So I gotta try not to crash into a whole bunch of crap.
[04:47.06]Here we go.
[04:47.90]It looks like we went through a tunnel and our arms, like, broke in the tunnel.
[04:53.64]Oh, no!
[04:54.16]I didn't mean to jump out!
[04:57.95]And we're going straight this way.
[04:59.27]It's just straight down this road.
[05:00.87]Holy crap, the number of cops.
[05:05.43]There goes the hood.
[05:06.03]Straight down?
[05:07.05]Yeah, straight down.
[05:07.85]No, wait a minute.
[05:09.39]I gotta get out.
[05:11.01]Here we go, Stealth.
[05:12.19]Here we go, Stealth.
[05:13.88]Jump out of the way!
[05:15.40]Parachute!
[05:15.96]Parachute!
[05:16.36]No!
[05:21.47]Oh my god, I just watched you do that.
[05:25.35]I just defied gravity and then face-planted into a rock.
[05:27.78]Yeah, I face-planted into the water.
[05:29.86]I, like, magnetically attracted myself to the water.
[05:32.92]Oh, I got an idea.
[05:42.05]I'm having to dodge so much traffic to get down there.
[05:51.23]It's gonna be almost impossible to go in a straight line.
[05:52.87]Where seems to be a car?
[05:53.70]Right in the way, actually.
[05:54.64]Let me, like, shoot him to make a move.
[05:56.04]Oh, this car?
[05:57.14]You mean this car?
[05:58.52]Oh, no!
[05:59.02]What?
[06:02.92]How did you completely miss?
[06:05.32]Because I rammed into the car that was in the way.
[06:07.74]Oh, Etalyx.
[06:10.96]Hi.
[06:11.06]Do you need some help getting back up?
[06:12.14]Yeah, just shoot me.
[06:13.22]Alright.
[06:14.00]Oh, no problem.
[06:15.36]Oh, jeez!
[06:16.84]Oh, this is gonna be a complete disaster.
[06:26.80]Right, if anyone survives this, I will pay you such good money.
[06:30.90]If anybody survives and lands on the other side of the river, you get- Is that an- is that a talons?
[06:37.22]Oh, that's a talons.
[06:38.09]Oh, here we go, here we go, here it comes, jump!
[06:40.91]I'm still alive!
[06:42.03]I'm alive!
[06:42.43]I'm alive too!
[06:46.23]I think I missed Boo.
[06:48.55]No, you didn't hit me.
[06:49.49]Oh, I hit him.
[06:51.15]I think that's him.
[06:52.27]No.
[06:53.08]Why do we all have white berets?
[06:55.05]Well, that's definitely him right there.
[06:56.81]Alright, here we go.
[06:59.87]Run.
[07:00.25]Oh, yeah.
[07:09.25]If I can just get right on the edge, it'd be perfect.
[07:11.55]Oh, God.
[07:11.99]Oh, no!
[07:16.17]Oh, no!
[07:16.89]I took Jemra out, if anything.
[07:19.25]Why would you sit on a bike?
[07:20.98]I'm gonna see how far he could, like, lift us off.
[07:25.70]Am I gonna get to you in time?
[07:26.92]Whoa!
[07:27.58]Alright, here we go.
[07:32.46]Oh, yeah.
[07:39.48]Look at that wheelie.
[07:41.02]Look at that.
[07:42.56]That wheelie.
[07:47.06]That wheelie is still going.
[07:48.62]You're not meant to hold it for this long.
[07:50.32]Poor lady.
[07:54.54]We're still going.
[07:55.44]You're going to have to stop very soon.
[07:57.34]Oh, Christ.
[08:01.35]Oh, my face.
[08:02.61]That was amazing.
[08:03.87]Looks like it just upgraded his car.
[08:06.54]I did, that I did.
[08:07.86]I guess that's why there's a vacant car.
[08:10.72]Right next door, he's driving.
[08:11.70]What's going on?
[08:12.60]It's Bill.
[08:12.94]Uh oh.
[08:16.82]Oh, you've been juked, sir.
[08:20.41]I shot out another one of his tires, it's alright.
[08:25.17]Oh no, steam overlay.
[08:26.55]I can't see what I'm doing.
[08:29.44]He's ejected.
[08:30.14]He's aiming at us.
[08:32.80]Wow.
[08:33.66]I'm alive.
[08:35.94]I'm alive.
[08:37.14]Etalyx, how did you get over here?
[08:40.02]I drove.
[08:40.50]Don't move.
[08:46.71]Don't you move.
[08:47.39]I'll blow you up.
[08:48.13]Don't move.
[08:48.69]I moved.
[08:50.75]You don't move.
[08:51.19]I'll blow you up.
[08:52.45]Don't move.
[08:54.11]Oh.
[08:54.59]My.
[08:56.11]God.
[08:59.76]You don't move, sir.
[09:01.72]You don't move.
[09:13.47]Oh, wow.
[09:15.73]Uh-oh.
[09:16.03]Alright, Donix, you're my new driver.
[09:17.15]That was amazing.
[09:18.45]You've won survival of the fittest.
[09:19.71]That was brutal.
[09:47.52]you
