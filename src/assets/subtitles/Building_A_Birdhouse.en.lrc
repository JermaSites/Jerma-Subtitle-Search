[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.28]Hey, sorry I'm late.
[00:07.24]I had a couple things I had to do that I wasn't aware of until like 45 minutes ago.
[00:15.33]Let me just get a tweet out there.
[00:23.03]Hey, a tweet, what a coincidence.
[00:28.67]tweeting out a birdhouse stream I mean there's something funny there I think uh rvm just gave out five community subs thank you so much rvm right off the bat didn't even get started yet I'm making a gaming bird like this is gonna be the worst stream you've ever watched hold on let me just I'll be right back give me one second
[01:16.88]Okay.
[01:19.63]So yes, tonight is, uh... There's more proof that all you need to do is kind of just be the one guy sometimes.
[01:33.29]Maybe like five or four or five days ago, somebody in the recommended channel just wrote, build a gamer birdhouse.
[01:44.66]And I was like, oh, that's...
[01:47.08]That's really dumb.
[01:49.56]And then I bought a birdhouse kit.
[01:53.94]And that's where we are right here.
[01:55.58]That's what we're doing now.
[01:58.62]One guy.
[01:59.76]More proof that eventually, if you stick around long enough, you'll probably be the one guy.
[02:12.14]And I was thinking about it as I was unpacking this thing and just looking at it and taking a look at the directions.
[02:18.64]This is gonna be really bad.
[02:26.55]This is gonna be bad.
[02:27.77]I just want to make sure right off the bat, your expectations are very low, okay?
[02:32.49]We're talking, like, think about where you could put your expectations, like a scale of a 10-point scale, okay?
[02:39.03]Uh, one is... Hold on, let's get, like, this off the screen here.
[02:44.67]So, uh, expectation one on a ten-point scale is a guy turns on a livestream and he's asleep with a black screen.
[02:55.14]Right?
[02:57.34]It's ti- they are- what do you mean it's tiny?
[03:04.11]Uh... ShiXOXO, thanks for the five community subs.
[03:08.27]Ooh, and I'm already dropping stuff.
[03:09.63]That's super glue.
[03:11.65]Don't wanna get- don't wanna get that on your lips!
[03:14.50]Watch be- uh, hey, here's like the funny joke for today.
[03:17.48]I'm gonna pretend that this is ChapStick at some point.
[03:20.16]I'm gonna put super glue on my lips and I'm gonna go and then everyone's gonna laugh.
[03:28.26]Ripped shirt?
[03:29.96]No, it's old.
[03:30.70]This is like a shirt from 1981.
[03:34.40]Is it ripped shirt or is he wearing a choker?
[03:37.09]No, this is a ripped shirt.
[03:38.71]I'm not wearing a fucking choker.
[03:45.65]Okay.
[03:52.91]Wait.
[03:55.03]Anyways, let me just get a sip of my delicious fucking tea.
[04:00.94]Ow, my tooth.
[04:09.57]That's good tea.
[04:11.03]Alright, my train of thought.
[04:12.97]Thank you to the five community subs.
[04:13.99]Thanks for coming out.
[04:15.13]And so here's what we're talking about here.
[04:17.89]So if you talk about a point scale for streams.
[04:21.53]One is guy turns on stream, black screen, sleeping.
[04:24.88]You just hear him snoring.
[04:26.36]And that stream is on for 12 hours.
[04:28.08]Nothing changes.
[04:28.74]It's just black screen, guy snoring.
[04:31.12]A two would be cam on, guy sleeping and snoring.
[04:36.40]Not just black screen.
[04:38.40]A three...
[04:40.75]is this stream.
[04:45.02]That's what you're about to watch.
[04:47.26]You're about to watch a tier above the guy sleeping with the webcam on.
[04:54.71]Let's see what we even got in here.
[04:55.83]We have to work with this like nails in here.
[04:59.19]So I gotta be actually careful that I got this.
[05:01.83]I could get hurt.
[05:04.20]Somebody just wrote joke incoming.
[05:07.65]This is the joke.
[05:08.51]This is it.
[05:09.07]Like somebody told me to build this on stream.
[05:12.51]It's gonna be so loud.
[05:13.45]This fucking hammer is gonna make like loud noises.
[05:17.04]The neighbors are gonna fucking hear me.
[05:24.64]Alright.
[05:25.24]So let's take a look at the pieces we've got in our fucking birdhouse.
[05:31.97]No, it's too early for that.
[05:36.93]So this little guy right here, that's what the bird sits on when he's outside of his house.
[05:44.05]Let's go over the pieces.
[05:45.11]So we've got front door, back door.
[05:48.27]I don't know what these are.
[05:56.39]Side panels?
[06:01.25]Okay, well, this has like a, why is this like a tombstone?
[06:07.20]It's like a bird tombstone.
[06:10.02]Okay.
[06:11.23]Uh.
[06:12.75]This looks like the floor.
[06:15.21]Where's the roof?
[06:18.43]Where's the actual roof to this thing?
[06:20.13]And I got- and paint.
[06:22.84]It came with four paints.
[06:25.04]So I hope you're ready to paint this, because you only get to choose between yellow, white, red, or blue.
[06:33.26]So, was this the roof?
[06:36.09]This comes with instructions, but should I try to build it without the instructions?
[06:39.07]Maybe that would be more fun.
[06:43.81]I don't think fun is the right word.
[06:45.77]Without the instructions, but I don't know how I'm gonna do this.
[06:48.87]I need the instructions.
[06:49.81]I need the glue.
[06:54.63]Alright.
[06:56.96]No, no instructions.
[07:01.12]I can fucking do this.
[07:02.10]Alright, so here we go.
[07:02.92]So it's gonna look, let's just block it out so we make sure we know what we're doing here.
[07:09.47]Like this, right?
[07:11.43]This is a fucking small birdhouse.
[07:14.09]What bird is going to fit in here?
[07:19.79]No bird's gonna fit in this.
[07:23.73]By the way, I don't think there are any birds in Las Vegas.
[07:30.73]Are there birds that can- I don't think there are birds here.
[07:35.90]Alright, let's go.
[07:38.63]I'm using the fucking instructional manual.
[07:41.69]Alright, sort the pieces, find the hammer, ask an adult if you need to find a hammer.
[07:49.18]Are they labeled?
[07:53.50]Don't use it!
[07:59.74]Fine, here you go!
[08:25.58]Okay, this is... This is the top.
[08:29.96]This is the roof.
[08:31.56]Because look, it has to go like that, right?
[08:33.16]Because there's that chain that comes over.
[08:35.39]So this has to be the roof because there's a chain in here.
[08:44.17]So this is the floor.
[08:46.79]Is that the floor?
[08:50.89]I don't think that's the floor.
[08:52.17]I think this is the floor.
[09:04.22]Cause then, ah, look at that!
[09:07.21]You guys didn't think I was gonna figure it out.
[09:10.03]No, this is the floor right here.
[09:12.09]Here's the floor.
[09:17.68]How do I, I have to like hammer the nails in here?
[09:21.62]But which way do those go?
[09:23.82]So that's the floor.
[09:25.71]Here are the side panels.
[09:37.57]Like that?
[09:41.08]What about the sides?
[09:42.56]Are these the sides?
[09:49.98]Give me instructions!
[09:51.33]I don't care!
[09:51.97]I crumpled them all up!
[09:57.63]Let me just get the base first and then we can, who cares?
[10:04.91]These are the side walls.
[10:06.19]How the fuck are these the side walls?
[10:09.85]I had it right.
[10:10.49]So how- what?
[10:16.28]So this is the roof.
[10:21.92]So that's the floor.
[10:23.16]I had it right the first time.
[10:24.64]How are these the walls?
[10:27.11]Those are walls?
[10:30.09]Look at this from this angle.
[10:33.17]This is not- That's not a fucking wall.
[10:40.45]This is very clearly not going to help.
[10:44.93]They go on top of the wood?
[10:46.33]Okay, wait, what about the pro- I'm doing the first two steps.
[11:01.41]The floor.
[11:01.91]What do you mean the floor?
[11:10.58]You're talking like that.
[11:19.86]There we go.
[11:21.35]Okay.
[11:23.17]Right there.
[11:30.87]I have to glue this shit on top of the floor.
[11:34.45]Wait, I'm gonna stop reading this chat room.
[11:45.56]Okay, just let me just read this.
[11:47.46]Select perch B and house front C.
[11:51.07]which is this, these two, okay.
[11:53.35]I'm doing it one at a time.
[11:54.51]Place, I can't do it, if I do it in the wrong order, I'm not gonna be able to get it right and the no birds that are in Las Vegas are not gonna enjoy this.
[12:03.74]I need a small amount of glue on end of perch and insert small.
[12:07.30]Alright, so I gotta glue this thing on.
[12:09.84]Just relax.
[12:13.04]See, it's gotta go right there.
[12:15.26]I don't even need glue.
[12:18.25]No birds are gonna enjoy this.
[12:20.13]They'll be fine.
[12:22.89]So this is the glue.
[12:23.57]I can't, I'm not gonna fucking be stupid.
[12:25.24]I'm not gonna eat this.
[12:27.12]Although it, oh, it is tempting though.
[12:30.94]Frosting, frosting, it's like frosting.
[12:32.20]It's not frosting, Jeremy!
[12:34.18]Okay, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, okay.
[12:37.28]Whoa, okay.
[12:39.74]So this is glue.
[12:40.67]What kind of glue is this?
[12:42.31]Oh, that comes out fucking fast.
[12:44.51]You guys want a good shot of the glue going on?
[13:02.51]Perfect amount of glue.
[13:03.83]Look at that.
[13:08.73]See?
[13:09.67]And then that goes in here.
[13:16.01]Like this.
[13:16.53]I don't want to see any of the glues go out around the edges though.
[13:19.45]I already fucked it up.
[13:22.71]It's already ruined.
[13:23.57]Look it.
[13:23.95]It's already ruined.
[13:25.79]Already I fucked it up.
[13:27.17]It's already fucked up.
[13:28.33]I already ruined it.
[13:29.60]I already fucking ruined it.
[13:31.32]See?
[13:34.50]No, don't.
[13:37.00]Whatever, who fucking cares, okay?
[13:38.94]Done.
[13:40.74]Let's take a look at what the next step is.
[13:44.49]Place floor on flat surface.
[13:48.57]This is the floor.
[13:54.71]What?
[13:55.93]Like this.
[14:04.18]Just wipe it.
[14:05.71]No, I'm not going to wipe it.
[14:08.93]Okay, I will stop after this and I'll throw the directions behind me in a fucking fit of rage.
[14:13.41]You'll think it's cute, right?
[14:17.67]Okay.
[14:18.63]On the inside bottom edge, I've got to run glue down here and then glue it.
[14:23.98]To here.
[14:24.98]Like this.
[14:28.34]So we've got glue.
[14:30.24]Again.
[14:30.52]Oh, fuck.
[14:32.77]I need like...
[14:33.81]Four people for this.
[14:48.00]OK.
[14:51.49]Ow!
[14:54.05]So like this.
[14:54.99]And then I have to hammer this in.
[15:42.23]What happened?
[15:46.09]Ask your mother for help.
[15:47.11]I'm gonna have like sticky fucking hands.
[15:50.85]Let me look at the instructions again.
[15:56.51]That is the floor.
[16:04.27]Place floor on flat surface.
[16:06.41]That's what I did.
[16:10.47]Take the front.
[16:13.08]Place against floor edge matching up nail holes.
[16:18.57]Don't you understand?
[16:19.23]I had it done right.
[16:23.33]Like, I did that right.
[16:25.65]Like this.
[16:26.63]That was correct.
[16:27.87]Why is everybody freaking out?
[16:34.40]That's what I was supposed to do.
[16:35.68]Because, see, look.
[16:41.26]See?
[16:42.81]See the holes there?
[16:44.59]Something else has to go in there.
[16:45.59]Because this is the floor.
[16:49.81]On top?
[16:52.51]What do you mean on top?
[16:53.33]Like this?
[16:55.89]How am I supposed to hammer this in?
[17:00.96]How am I supposed to hammer this in?
[17:05.72]I can hammer it in this way.
[17:09.30]Why do I even need to put the glue there?
[17:10.78]Just fucking hammer it in.
[17:20.63]Fucking God damn it.
[17:23.84]Now I don't know where the holes are.
[17:28.40]He's pretending.
[17:33.04]Yeah, got you.
[17:36.17]Alright.
[17:37.31]So then like this, and then the nails.
[17:41.51]Look at that, alright.
[17:47.99]Alright, I don't want a bird to go in this.
[17:49.95]They're gonna like die from like the glue poisoning.
[17:55.09]Okay, we're gonna hold it there for 10 seconds.
[18:03.25]Alright, now I need to hammer the nails in.
[18:06.97]How am I gonna do that though?
[18:07.99]Is it?
[18:11.74]Oh, whoa, disgusting, there's a fucking worm in my fucking drink.
[18:17.03]Don't step on those.
[18:24.33]You didn't.
[18:24.87]Whatever.
[18:27.72]Don't step on that.
[18:29.10]Watch it.
[18:29.74]Hey, watch it.
[18:31.34]This is fucking dangerous now.
[18:41.14]Watch it.
[18:56.77]I don't think this is possible.
[18:57.83]Alright, I got an idea.
[19:03.83]Okay, so if I just like make it land on the spikes.
[19:12.02]I'm gonna put a nail through my hand on this stream.
[19:20.26]I'm taking my fucking time, man.
[19:21.62]Alright, here we go, ready?
[19:28.83]You gotta put... Alright, it's in.
[19:44.86]Now I gotta get the other one.
[19:51.93]Oh look, like coddled soft hands man.
[19:57.08]Scared by, scared by fucking hammer and nail.
[20:04.26]I don't touch those things!
[20:11.87]That's it right?
[20:12.31]That's going in?
[20:12.73]Let's get it in one hit.
[20:16.89]Oh no, don't do that.
[20:18.01]This is dangerous and you could be, you could get hurt.
[20:21.11]Don't fucking try this at home.
[20:23.15]Uh, yeah, don't build a birdhouse at home.
[20:24.81]That's, they're fucking dangerous, guys.
[20:32.95]Pretty sick.
[20:33.45]Alright, that's good.
[20:38.18]It's in there, it ain't going anywhere.
[20:45.74]Alright.
[20:46.88]Now we're on the right track.
[20:47.76]Now I don't need... I know this is the back.
[20:50.77]So that's going here.
[20:52.99]That's probably really fucking loud.
[20:56.99]Table dented.
[20:58.73]Where?
[21:00.81]Right there?
[21:03.96]Where's the table dented?
[21:06.80]Right there?
[21:07.64]Right here?
[21:07.92]Hmm.
[21:15.92]Stop.
[21:16.50]This table is... Alright.
[21:19.78]Listen to me.
[21:20.90]This table has seen a lot of work.
[21:24.82]I've built every labo on these tables.
[21:28.47]That's a lie.
[21:29.15]But some of them.
[21:30.49]This was thrown in as the last second in the moving truck.
[21:34.11]Because it was just a random shitty table that I still had.
[21:37.55]That my mother gave me like ten years ago.
[21:40.62]So...
[21:42.47]Look, it's gonna be fine.
[21:43.75]Don't worry, this is not an expensive table.
[21:45.17]This table was like probably four and a half dollars.
[21:47.98]12 years ago, 20 years ago.
[21:50.24]It's an heirloom?
[21:51.70]No, it's tested.
[21:52.76]Look, it's tested with the test of time and it can take anything I want.
[21:58.55]This is my like, fuck you table, you know what I mean?
[22:01.27]Like build a birdhouse and paint on it.
[22:02.93]Alright, will you guys relax?
[22:15.35]How are these... Wait a minute.
[22:23.36]Look at how small that is.
[22:25.28]A bird can't fit in here.
[22:26.64]This is a wall?
[22:37.87]If I were a bird, I would throw up in here.
[22:39.41]I'd get claustrophobic inside of this place.
[22:44.86]Alright, where are the holes here?
[22:45.98]There's a hole here.
[22:49.08]So these two holes are designed to go in?
[22:53.57]There's holes on the edges here, so that's like this?
[22:57.55]Okay, so they'll have to connect that.
[23:03.67]Let's glue it first.
[23:14.35]I don't understand what the glue is for if you have nails.
[23:27.25]Okay.
[23:29.45]The wasps are gonna appreciate this nest.
[23:38.28]I'm done, I'm done using the glue.
[23:40.12]Look, okay, the glue will be the icing on our, is it gonna be like a gingerbread house?
[23:44.08]I'll just put like icing swirls on it.
[23:45.82]Fuck this shit.
[23:46.52]Get this out of here.
[23:49.74]Don't, dude, don't get that on the nice desk.
[23:51.69]Don't put that over here.
[23:57.67]Don't fuck up this desk.
[23:59.13]I don't care about this one.
[24:00.65]This one, they might look the same, guys, but they are not the same.
[24:03.13]They are very much not the same desk.
[24:07.57]I'm so paranoid.
[24:08.30]I dumped a whole coffee on here the other day.
[24:09.70]Alright, that was enough time to load it in.
[24:12.02]Is this shit blurry?
[24:17.80]Is this blurry?
[24:21.71]No, you're good.
[24:25.73]Basically the same desk.
[24:26.97]No, it's not the same desk.
[24:31.03]I'm just realizing right now where the web with the facecam is.
[24:34.72]This looks like I'm like fucking huge.
[24:36.36]I got like a tiny head and a huge fucking arms.
[24:40.26]Yeah, this looks easy enough for me.
[24:42.02]It's like a mech suit.
[24:47.68]The body type of a fucking Megazoid.
[24:49.78]Alright, uh, nail.
[25:09.57]Right in the front, right?
[25:10.47]Right there?
[25:18.24]Huh.
[25:22.92]I'm not using glue anymore.
[25:24.06]There's no reason to do it.
[25:25.06]It doesn't do anything.
[25:27.94]It doesn't fucking do anything.
[25:33.97]I have to hold this and hammer the nail in.
[25:37.92]I should have put these on first.
[25:39.44]Why did I not do the walls first?
[26:13.49]Fucking gamer birdhouse.
[26:36.10]How can I think of this with physics, right?
[26:39.48]Because, you know, because phonetically speaking,
[26:43.65]I have to connect these two together, but the centripetal force of the glue is not holding it, so it falls off.
[26:54.99]So I gotta go like that.
[26:56.50]Oh yeah, I got it.
[26:57.72]I got it right fucking here.
[27:00.00]That lined up right?
[27:01.02]Yeah, fucking just squeeze it.
[27:24.14]Alright, just get it.
[27:25.00]Here we go.

[27:35.85]Got it.
[27:47.53]No!
[27:51.45]There's a fucking little gap.
[28:06.20]There's no gap anymore.
[28:11.12]Get over there, motherfucker.
[28:27.14]Am I hitting this into cement or I don't understand?
[28:52.04]I'm gonna break it.
[28:54.16]I'm gonna break it.
[28:56.38]It's in.
[28:59.89]No, it's in, it's in.
[29:11.28]Look at how red I am.
[29:30.75]come back to that later I gotta get the other one in now how am I supposed to do this how are you supposed to actually do this I gotta think of what color I want to paint my birdhouse oh my god and now it's like bent
[29:59.03]The nail is bent.
[30:00.29]I bent the fucking nail.
[30:04.29]Look, no, alright, it's an extra perch for the bird.
[30:06.99]You know what I mean?
[30:09.71]The bird, one daddy bird can go here, right?
[30:13.88]And then baby bird can go here.
[30:16.28]And then baby bird two can go over here.
[30:23.42]I'm like knocking out other nails.
[30:29.43]There's no pulling this out.
[30:30.58]I'm already committed.
[30:31.88]I've got to just really get this in.
[30:35.48]I've become completely committed.
[30:37.80]But how?
[30:38.68]I'm going to need something to wedge this up against like a wall or something.
[30:40.98]I'm going to like push up against... No, but I can't like... I'm going to put a hole in the wall.
[30:48.61]Use the side of the table.
[30:50.21]Yeah, but look at it.
[30:50.83]It's all wiggly.
[31:07.52]I think that was a clue in my head.
[31:10.04]No, that wasn't.
[31:10.66]I'm just panicking for no reason.
[31:19.64]Okay.
[31:21.14]Alright.
[31:22.04]What's next on, this is not even, alright, so now I gotta put the other wall, no, I gotta put the other nail in.
[31:31.15]God, this is, are we having fun yet?
[31:32.83]You know what I mean?
[31:33.37]We haven't fun yet on this stream.
[31:40.03]No, no, no.
[31:44.76]Like, hey, fucking one guy wanted to do this.
[31:48.02]You understand?
[31:48.60]That's what we're doing this for.
[31:51.56]One fucking guy said, hold on.
[31:59.39]Alright, that was on.
[32:02.71]This feels a little not secure at all, though.
[32:07.74]Alright, you know when you're sitting at a dinner table and if you put your elbow on it goes and then you have to spend the entire evening trying to not put enough pressure on the table so you don't knock everybody's food around and knock everybody's drinks off and shit?
[32:23.22]I hate that, man.
[32:24.57]That's the absolute worst.
[32:25.59]You know, don't you like hate like fucking weird shit like that?
[32:27.35]Don't you just hate stuff like that, guys?
[32:28.55]Relatable?
[32:28.93]Alright, now other wall.
[32:41.27]This is gonna... I don't even know if I'm gonna get this correct.
[32:44.62]It's gonna be... this is gonna be so fucked up.
[32:50.00]So then this goes... I need... I need... I don't... the glue is not gonna... is not doing it for me.
[32:55.24]Forget about the glue.
[32:55.94]That's the decoration on top.
[32:57.46]I dropped nails on the ground.
[32:58.64]Don't... let me forget those.
[33:01.90]That'll go through my foot in like three days.
[33:10.90]Don't forget those, don't forget them.
[33:15.28]This birdhouse is like such a simple, stupid little shit birdhouse.
[33:22.43]Yeah, what's the point of the glue?
[33:24.51]It's just there to make like little, little Timmy think he's like working on something.
[33:30.79]Because you bet your ass that's why that's there.
[33:35.09]You think them parents are gonna let little Timmy pick up this hammer and fucking hammer this thing?
[33:40.73]No.
[33:41.92]That's what dad's for.
[33:42.90]That's what I'm for, you know what I mean?
[33:47.06]That's gotta go on the bottom one first.
[33:57.90]Get that in there.
[34:00.40]Okay, same deal as last time.
[34:01.92]I gotta... I gotta be careful because it's not flush.
[34:06.99]If it's not flush here, that means it's not gonna be flush up top either, though.
[34:11.35]Come on, get over here.
[34:20.99]Like this.
[34:22.26]Get on the edge of the table.
[34:24.64]Get on there.
[34:29.74]This doesn't feel right.
[34:39.50]I don't know what that was, I'm sorry.
[34:46.58]Alright, we're almost done with the construction.
[34:47.92]Actually, no, we're not.
[34:48.62]We have a lot of other shit to do with it.
[34:51.76]That was cool.
[34:53.71]I love those muscular arms.
[34:55.07]Hey, thanks.
[34:59.03]Alright, one... Don't... Every time I put my thumb here... Okay, I'm gonna line it up real quick.
[35:06.29]That's cartoon goofy from fucking the Disney Channel.
[35:09.56]That's how he hurts his hand every episode.
[35:14.60]What?
[35:14.74]Oh, it didn't go in.
[35:23.95]Uh-oh.
[35:29.33]No, we're good.
[35:33.29]Ooh, maybe not.
[35:35.17]I think I may have actually broke it.
[35:36.42]No, I didn't.
[35:36.80]We're fine.
[35:42.44]Alright, come on.
[35:43.12]Don't goofy this.
[35:44.76]Do not goofy this.
[35:47.26]It's in the perfect spot to get goofy, and I don't want to do that.
[35:50.10]So we're going to be very gentle.
[36:07.71]It's going like this.
[36:22.98]Whatever, I don't have to fucking live here.
[36:26.26]So then hammer it in there.
[36:30.26]Almost got, it's almost complete.
[36:35.31]I can't, it's almost complete for us to go to the top and just baseball throw it down into the ground and watch it explode.
[36:42.39]We're not doing that, I'm kidding.
[36:48.99]Jesus, he's not very smart, is he?
[36:53.43]It's a fucking birdhouse.
[36:55.05]Do you think that these things are cut correctly?
[37:00.55]No, they mass produce 500 fucking million of these and they're all at random specs.
[37:05.32]They're not cut correctly.
[37:06.84]They're not all cut correctly.
[37:14.74]Yes, they are.
[37:15.44]It says who?
[37:16.74]Do you work at Birdhouse Factory 4?
[37:22.01]It's just some credentials.
[37:27.37]Oh, you see, I work at the birdhouse factory.
[37:30.71]They're all cut to spec.
[37:32.98]There ain't any room for error in my birdhouse factory.
[37:39.98]How is this gonna stay down here?
[37:44.94]No, I gotta go through them.
[37:45.94]No, I have to go through this one first.
[37:48.06]I can't go through the bottom because I have to connect it first.
[37:55.66]Yeah, alright.
[37:57.02]What side of the birdhouse factory did you guys wake up on today?
[38:01.31]Fuck!
[38:07.96]No, it's alright.
[38:08.52]I thought it was really wrong.
[38:23.96]Mmm, that's moving a lot.
[38:26.30]I don't like how that's moving around so much.
[38:30.82]These pieces of wood are near flawless for a quarter of a penny.
[38:37.09]Really?
[38:40.95]And that's so.
[38:41.71]Is that so?
[39:00.11]He's the same piece.
[39:06.22]Would you look at that?
[39:09.06]Would you look at this?
[39:10.20]That's not exact, is it?
[39:15.90]It's a little... What happened here?
[39:19.48]What happened there?
[39:21.22]Factory?
[39:26.66]What happened here?
[39:45.51]Yeah, get the birdhouse factory exposed.
[39:53.71]I don't even know where these... Where were these plugged in?
[39:57.58]I don't know.
[39:58.86]I gotta move this way, though.
[40:00.00]I'm stuck over here.
[40:02.10]Not in the birdhouse.
[40:03.64]I'm talking about in this life.
[40:07.02]There we go.
[40:07.50]Alright.
[40:09.80]Of course, baby!
[40:10.53]Whoa!
[40:14.26]Almost did it, Mickey.
[40:32.12]Don't fucking do this at your house.
[40:49.35]It didn't do anything.
[41:02.32]How the fuck?
[41:04.56]It's still, the Pinocchio nose is in the front.
[41:06.69]That's why it makes it impossible to do this.
[41:23.49]Table, table, broken house.
[41:35.13]Alright, looking pretty good.
[41:36.29]I'm gonna do the other side first.
[41:50.35]I don't know why... Does anybody else feel like this when you're working with tools?
[41:53.37]Especially with wood and nails?
[41:55.71]So, this is getting very tight right now.
[41:58.11]To a point where I... It's like... I gotta pull it and then hammer it in.
[42:02.21]Don't you feel like the wood's gonna explode?
[42:04.43]Isn't that... Can't that happen?
[42:06.64]Can't there be like enough pressure being pulling and pushing and crack crack crack that the thing just blows the fuck up?
[42:14.90]I don't want that to happen.
[42:15.88]So I'm being very careful.
[42:20.83]This thing's going to explode.
[42:34.82]Ow.
[42:34.90]Alright, I'm missing a nail somewhere, right?
[42:43.56]Thank you for reminding me about the nail on the floor.
[42:52.68]They're still gonna put the roof on.
[42:57.20]Oh, shh.
[42:59.16]There's already a bird in here.
[43:01.22]He like found his way in.
[43:02.26]How does this even?
[43:19.39]I'm barely fucking reaching here, huh?
[43:30.74]You can see it better that way, right?
[43:37.05]I'm very proud of myself right now.
[43:39.27]This is an accomplishment.
[43:48.31]You know what I mean?
[43:49.03]I'm going to go to sleep tonight and I'm going to be going, just having a couple of nightmares, like fucking nightmares of like Jason, the chainsaw, like chainsawing me.
[43:57.36]And then I'm going to scream, wake up and like go back to bed.
[43:59.92]And then I'm going to have like a pretty decent dream about like birds and, you know, I built that.
[44:06.09]That was fun.
[44:15.61]I don't think that's in.
[44:16.99]It is, actually.
[44:18.31]Alright, the general construction is complete.
[44:21.07]No, it's not.
[44:23.40]Not yet.
[44:27.30]Are you stressed out?
[44:30.14]No, I'm just kidding.
[44:48.65]Bird lands in the bottom fall.
[44:50.13]Yeah.
[44:50.47]Alright.
[44:50.67]So we make like a bird trap door.
[44:53.14]The bird lands and like falls out.
[44:56.40]And then I'll build a bigger, better house.
[44:59.10]Right?
[44:59.78]Connected.
[45:00.26]And this thing has cushions and it's got like cable TV and it's five times as big.
[45:04.89]And they go into that one.
[45:05.83]And then this is just kind of the entrance.
[45:07.69]So then the people don't know what the bird has.
[45:11.11]I mean, this is like the fake house.
[45:12.65]Like, I just have like four walls and a fucking front door.
[45:15.46]But they don't know.
[45:16.04]Like they come down, the trap door goes whoop, they fall through.
[45:18.92]And then there's another exit out the back of the tree.
[45:22.90]So they can have as many nuts in there as they want.
[45:35.82]Bird tax evasion.
[45:44.42]I did it.
[45:45.44]Now I'm just gonna put these two on.
[45:46.68]Now how the fuck does this work?
[45:50.78]Because this little, little slot here.
[46:04.31]So it goes like this.
[46:07.46]Oh, wait.
[46:08.04]Hold on.
[46:08.58]I see.
[46:08.96]I get it.
[46:11.30]Do I?
[46:11.52]Yeah, because the chain goes through there.
[46:16.60]Because this goes like that.
[46:18.58]Because there's the slots on top.
[46:23.11]You should really pull your pants up.
[46:25.01]I'm wearing pants today.
[46:26.81]I had to.
[46:27.23]How the fuck?
[46:29.65]No, it goes like this?
[46:32.11]Because then the chain goes...
[46:36.87]How the fuck does this work?
[46:40.59]It goes like that.
[46:41.86]How does a chain go in here?
[46:44.86]The chain has to go up and through there.
[46:53.08]Like that?
[46:53.58]Because the divot, I don't know if you guys can see.
[47:02.05]I'm pretty sure it has to go like this.
[47:10.89]I have no fucking idea.
[47:12.11]Because the chain has to go through.
[47:13.25]The chain has to go through.
[47:14.97]So... You know what?
[47:17.51]It's like that.
[47:18.11]Got it.
[47:18.73]Bingo.
[47:20.49]But this might have to turn around like this.
[47:22.22]Because the chain goes... No.
[47:27.36]No, I had it right.
[47:28.34]Bingo.
[47:32.42]Okay, so like that.
[47:33.32]So this one's going to go on first.
[47:36.93]Oh, shit.
[47:37.33]What?
[47:39.31]What?
[47:41.14]How the fuck does this go on?
[47:43.98]There's no holes here.
[47:44.86]I don't have a guide.
[47:45.52]I don't have any hole guide.
[47:58.70]The holes are on the top.
[48:01.98]I think that's how it works.
[48:02.92]I think this is how it goes.
[48:03.88]I'm just going to deal with it.
[48:06.33]I think.
[48:06.67]This is...
[48:13.02]Don't get angry!
[48:16.80]Because there's no... the only holes are on the top here.
[48:21.88]Nail it with the chain already attached.
[48:54.65]My neck is too thick for this.
[48:57.77]Somebody mentioned choker earlier.
[48:59.36]Okay.
[49:10.73]You can like see this digging into my skin.
[49:14.81]Hey, what's up?
[49:17.23]Do you like my new look?
[49:19.45]It's just like digging into my body.
[49:24.77]Yeah, I'm gonna do like accessories now.
[49:26.20]What do you think?
[49:26.66]Now here's the worst part about this.
[49:32.95]I might not be able to get this off.
[49:54.18]See, it didn't even leave a mark.
[50:01.46]Very clearly it did.
[50:03.40]It's like a fucking red line.
[50:08.67]My neck just drank Kool-Aid.
[50:12.67]Whatever.
[50:14.27]How do I do this?
[50:16.29]I'm about to go get alcohol.
[50:27.34]I'm done, I don't care.
[50:28.14]I was hanging, look, wouldn't it be better, okay, listen, hear me out.
[50:33.53]Hear me out, guys.
[50:34.91]Just wait.
[50:36.03]Don't you think it would be better if I put like water in here?
[50:39.73]And it looks like a bird hot tub?
[50:43.75]You know, like a bird bath.
[50:45.15]Look at how perfect this is.
[50:46.67]They come in here, they can put their towel over there, they go right through, they can be in the water, bird bath.
[50:52.54]take a bath, come out and leave.
[50:54.64]This is not a house, this is a bird, this is a shower.
[50:57.84]This is a shower that goes in your house.
[51:06.22]I don't think the seal is good enough though.
[51:12.09]There's no birds in Vegas.
[51:14.45]I slowly came to the realization about this.
[51:16.31]Alright, give me the instructions.
[51:19.26]Who ripped them?
[51:20.24]That's what I want to know.
[51:21.16]Who ripped them?
[51:22.60]Which one of you guys ripped these?
[51:24.02]Because I wouldn't... I... One of you guys possessed me.
[51:31.47]I saw like ripped paper and my eyes fucking turned red.
[51:40.49]Why am I... What am I sitting like?
[51:43.45]Okay.
[51:45.46]Oh, it's just the old treasure map.
[51:50.68]How do we build the old fucking hot tub, mate?
[51:52.52]Alright, so... Take a side wall piece E and run a thin line of glue on either edge.
[51:57.30]That's not where we are.
[51:58.10]We already did that.
[51:59.38]Lay roof panel F flat on working surface.
[52:03.18]Place roof panel G at a 45 degree angle on top of panel F, matching edges and nail holes.
[52:08.75]There's only one way to put these pieces together.
[52:10.59]This will ensure proper alignment.
[52:11.89]Once you've lined up the nail holes, remove roof panel G and run a thin line on the length.
[52:15.63]Okay.
[52:15.83]Yes.
[52:19.68]Get out of my head.
[52:20.55]Stop it.
[52:22.63]God damn it.
[52:23.81]No.
[52:24.27]Okay, I'm back.
[52:29.99]I'm just fucking connecting the damn thing.
[52:35.82]Like this.
[52:37.42]There's only one way the thing can go.
[52:38.88]This is the way it goes.
[52:41.14]Like that.
[52:41.62]Nail holes are here.
[52:45.60]I'm going to do it off camera.
[52:53.47]it was the goblin okay so here like right here alright the instructions weren't clear enough for me like that how the fuck am I gonna do this do you see how impossible this is
[53:22.25]How would a six year old do this?
[53:41.25]Alright, score check.
[53:42.21]I want a score check of the string.
[53:43.35]I told you it was gonna be a three.
[53:52.97]Four?
[53:58.79]You can't, Jeremy, you can't hold it and put it down and then hammer it.
[54:07.44]Why does that hurt?
[54:24.90]Almost, this is gonna end bad.
[54:26.67]It's the only way I can do it.
[54:27.51]Imagine if I missed.
[54:36.01]I would just hit myself like right in the chest.
[54:44.03]My stomach is too malleable.
[54:46.47]It can't, it's not gonna work.
[54:47.53]I have too much of like a jiggly stomach.
[54:49.76]I gotta like rock hard abs this.
[55:03.85]Why is this not going so loud?
[55:05.57]I'm sorry.
[55:06.45]Ready?
[55:06.71]I'm going to try to talk over it.
[55:08.23]So it's not so loud.
[55:09.25]So sorry, it's loud.
[55:12.28]That wasn't even funny.
[55:38.95]This is just Nintendo Labo, but dangerous.
[55:44.03]This is going to be loud.
[55:44.79]I'm going to mute the mic because you're not going to want to listen to this.
[55:55.46]Trust me, you didn't want to hear that.
[56:00.94]That's a little fucked up, but that's fine.
[56:05.62]Alright, here comes the moment of truth.
[56:16.96]Don't do it.
[56:17.50]Don't do that joke.
[56:18.36]Don't do it.
[56:18.76]No one's going to think it's funny.
[56:28.83]Castlevania.
[56:29.35]Just pretend I did a Belmont thing.
[57:00.50]Get in there.
[57:03.06]Get it, oh, get in, oh.
[57:11.05]I'm just gonna put it on the ground, okay?
[57:14.07]Why do I need to hang this?
[57:16.93]I'm just gonna put it under the dirt.
[57:23.97]Fuck you.
[57:25.43]How did this even happen?
[57:30.17]Birds fly so they can land on the ground.
[57:32.49]They go to eat the worms on the ground.
[57:34.17]They can't go in their house.
[57:38.21]Yeah, a squirrel will just go in there and take all their stuff.
[57:41.95]So add a security system.
[57:44.77]Which is what I'm gonna add.
[57:50.82]Okay.
[57:52.50]The chain is in.
[57:55.52]So how the fuck do I do this?
[58:00.32]I have to connect these two.
[58:03.18]How the heck am I gonna do that?
[58:07.92]What the heck is gonna happen?
[58:09.78]What the heck?
[58:11.33]Okay, I need the knife.
[58:29.55]No, I need to paint this first.
[58:30.98]Get out of here.
[58:32.16]Get it out.
[58:33.32]Get it out of here.
[58:33.92]This has to be painted before the chain goes on.
[58:38.68]There you go.
[58:39.34]There's your little birdhouse, guys.
[58:41.04]There's the fun little birdhouse.
[58:43.02]Okay.
[58:44.90]Now I need... How do I keep this on?
[58:46.43]Do I have to glue this?
[58:49.55]Alright, so do we want the birdhouse to have like a Sonic the Hedgehog hair?
[58:53.45]Or... Like a visor.
[59:01.43]Well, balding.
[59:02.71]I mean, that's like balding or Sonic.
[59:11.08]Cause that, I don't, that's too typical.
[59:12.94]It's gotta be like somebody's blowing a hairdryer in the birdhouse's face.
[59:19.57]Oh, that's right, that's a lot of shade for the bird.
[59:22.53]That's a nice shade there.
[59:27.67]That's not bad.
[59:32.13]then they can hang out but what bird is I don't this is what I don't understand this is the bird is supposed to sit here what bird is this big this is a bird a bird's not this big is this a replica is this like not supposed to be held anywhere
[59:57.71]This is a bug house.
[59:59.37]This is going to be filled with fucking cockroaches and beetles in like six months.
[60:07.28]I'm going to look in there and it's going to be like... That X-Files fucking sound effect is going to play.
[60:12.20]That like weird fucked up violin.
[60:20.71]I'm going to cause an infestation.
[60:25.40]Yeah, I know what a birdhouse looks like, but I mean, lots of birds have nests that are like this big, right?
[60:31.53]They're like huge.
[60:34.75]A fucking condor ain't going in there.
[60:43.77]A hawk ain't going in there.
[60:52.25]Uh-oh.
[60:53.45]This is not good.
[60:54.19]That's not good.
[60:57.65]Oh, that's not good at all.
[60:58.70]This is not even going to fit.
[61:02.72]Oh, shit.
[61:06.30]How did that happen?
[61:11.46]Oh, that's not good.
[61:12.26]But during the wintertime, they're going to get cold.
[61:14.42]That's raft.
[61:14.89]Alright, I'm just plugging it in.
[61:17.79]I'm hammering it in.
[61:20.07]Where are the nails that I dropped?
[61:23.15]Because I need both of them.
[61:33.44]Do you see it?
[61:39.73]I have no idea where they are.
[61:40.97]Alright, this is one.
[61:47.17]I'm gonna have to glue this, because I only have one.
[61:50.85]Wait, hold on a second.
[61:55.33]Did I only drop one?
[61:56.25]I think I only dropped one, right?
[62:11.03]Because the... How does this stay on?
[62:17.62]I don't think... That was a disgusting, gross, under the breath burp and I'm just like, hold on, what are these?
[62:22.84]What are these?
[62:27.58]These little hooks?
[62:28.48]What are those for?
[62:30.84]Use the glue?
[62:31.50]But this is the fucking icing.
[62:42.34]Alright, we're going with the shade.
[62:43.48]Because I want the bird to have a nice shade.
[62:46.24]Let's get the glue on there.
[62:48.73]I don't want to use that much of this though, because I swear to god this is really icing.
[62:57.83]And then I'm gonna paint it.
[62:59.39]And you'd better believe that we're not gonna spend very much time on that shit.
[63:09.62]The bird won't fit.
[63:12.66]Don't put that over there.
[63:15.60]I gotta think of a good color scheme with the four colors I can choose from.
[63:21.00]This is important.
[63:24.72]Yeah, but the bird, yeah, maybe the bird, but then, look, no, I'm doing the bald head.
[63:30.27]Because if a bird can't stand up, if a bird's this tall, right, then it can't, it'll bump its head on the ceiling.
[63:36.49]We're doing the bald head.
[63:48.94]Ruined it.
[63:49.58]How did I ruin it?
[63:52.78]And there we go.
[63:55.91]Alright, this needs to be hammered a little bit.
[63:57.59]How can I do this in a way that it's not going to... See?
[64:01.25]Look at that.
[64:03.17]It's perfect.
[64:11.24]What happened up here?
[64:16.70]It exploded like I told you it was going to.
[64:21.26]I split the wood.
[64:33.13]Alright, so now it's time to paint.
[64:35.91]This is gonna be a joy.
[64:37.25]What about this last nail?
[64:40.37]Extra nail.
[64:41.29]Alright, let me show you, can I show you the utensil that they gave in the box here?
[64:50.21]The utensil that they gave... Are you ready for this?
[64:55.09]Here's how you're supposed to paint the birdhouse.
[65:01.55]It's a fucking carrot brush.
[65:03.44]What am I supposed to do with this?
[65:06.50]I'm supposed to paint with this fucking little carrot.
[65:10.48]Alright, important.
[65:12.44]Red roof, yellow roof, white roof, blue roof.
[65:16.23]I ain't gonna... It's gotta be one color.
[65:23.30]I think... I think I like Blue Roof, but that's just me.
[65:31.71]Because then we get Blue and then... Blue White?
[65:38.15]Blue and then Sonic.
[65:39.99]Blue, Yellow... No, I'm not making a Sonic the Hedgehog birdhouse.
[65:46.38]Smart click the...
[65:50.01]Alright, fine.
[65:50.67]You want to play that game?
[65:51.49]We can play that game.
[65:53.19]Enhance it.
[66:06.87]Here we go.
[66:14.68]What have I selected here?
[66:15.62]Hold on.
[66:30.43]Wait, I can rip these off, right?
[66:31.93]No, I can't.
[66:32.39]We've got to get even closer.
[66:33.63]Fucking goddammit.
[66:34.51]Hold on.
[66:44.88]Okay, you ready?
[66:53.04]Go for it.
[67:00.14]No, it looks like blue is get don't click my face Blue is winning by a lot.
[67:07.87]Yeah.
[67:08.47]Yeah He's distracted me
[67:27.03]Why was- I'm such a total- I'm looking at the- Get away from me!
[67:35.31]Get out of here!
[67:37.29]I'm not afraid to use it!
[67:40.67]Don't- I didn't hit myself in the fucking face.
[67:42.37]Alright, it was blue.
[67:45.39]Alright, stop.
[67:46.26]Stop it.
[67:49.22]Everybody stop it.
[67:54.74]Stop.
[67:57.27]Alright, so the color of the fucking roof.
[68:02.27]Okay, so the color of the roof is gonna be blue.
[68:06.31]Please select the color.
[68:08.49]Please select the color of the front panel here, the front.
[68:13.31]What color is the front going to be?
[68:15.03]Oh, it's blue again.
[68:30.54]Blue?
[68:31.00]Is it blue or white?
[68:36.73]This is tough.
[68:37.53]If only, if only like a massive amount of you guys weren't clicking this spot right here.
[68:43.45]Alright, it's gonna be white.
[68:53.18]Why am I, I'm gonna hurt myself.
[68:54.92]Put that down.
[68:55.64]Alright, so we got blue.
[69:01.24]White.
[69:02.86]What would you like the back panel to be?
[69:06.46]Don't vote yet.
[69:09.44]Back panel.
[69:10.56]What do you want the back to be?
[69:15.34]Go ahead.
[69:15.72]I mean, geez.
[69:21.76]Blue.
[69:23.96]Really?
[69:27.22]That's gonna fuck it all up.
[69:29.48]Blue?
[69:33.06]So it's gonna be, so blue up top, blue on the back, white in the front.
[69:40.36]So then what about the side panels?
[69:46.07]Side panels, what are the side, both, they have to be the same.
[69:50.98]Side panels.
[70:01.44]Really?
[70:01.70]The whole thing's gonna be fucking blue?
[70:07.55]The whole thing is gonna be blue except for the white.
[70:12.79]Okay.
[70:18.17]What would you like the bottom, the base to be?
[70:21.20]What is the base?
[70:27.70]Oh, we're getting a little bit of a different story here.
[70:33.98]Red!
[70:34.32]This is just gonna be a Spider-Man house.
[70:41.54]Oh no, it's just red shoes for Sonic the fucking Hedgehog.
[70:46.21]Alright, bottom is red.
[70:48.13]What about the bottom?
[70:48.85]Most importantly, the little tip.
[70:52.11]What's the tip gonna be?
[70:57.21]Sonic does not have a fucking red nose.
[71:05.02]Yellow Okay, I think I get what you guys are saying here So we got blue all around blue blue blue blue white in the front yellow tip red base Okay, thank you for thank you for playing
[71:34.61]Let's try to get this back to where it was and begin painting.
[71:49.64]Fucking Sonic the Hedgehog.
[71:53.38]Okay, so let's get this a little closer.
[71:55.82]Alright, that's good.
[71:58.87]So let's begin.
[72:07.43]So how do I do this reliably?
[72:10.95]We have to start from the top.
[72:12.23]No, we can't start from the top.
[72:13.47]I have to do the bottom first.
[72:15.15]But how am I gonna, okay, bottom first.
[72:27.10]Red bottom?
[72:31.06]Do I have to, are these concentrated orange juices?
[72:33.34]Do I need water for this shit?
[72:37.18]No, I like this cup.
[72:38.77]Hold on.
[73:53.62]Okay, so I got something to do this with.
[73:58.31]I got like a machinima mixer shot glass.
[74:03.83]I don't even know where I, I don't even know who this gave this to me.
[74:07.65]But we're gonna use it to fucking dirty our brushes in.
[74:10.37]I think I got that like, so I don't know why, it was just in like a group of glasses.
[74:23.68]Maybe you got it from Machinima.
[74:25.20]Probably.
[74:26.20]Whatever.
[74:26.60]Let's just dirty our brushes in there.
[74:29.45]Alright, so we're going with red, right?
[74:36.61]Like this first?
[74:41.25]I have not painted in a very long time.
[74:43.01]Okay, so I gotta be careful here.
[74:45.29]I gotta do this correct, because if I don't do this correct, then the whole thing goes to hell.
[74:57.58]I already started.
[75:08.64]You don't need water to paint it?
[75:18.78]Wrong side!
[75:19.56]What are you talking about?
[75:20.38]This is the bottom!
[75:23.14]This is the bottom!
[75:24.54]The bottom of the device!
[75:29.21]How could this be the wrong side?
[75:30.19]It's the bottom.
[75:33.13]I don't know.
[75:33.55]This is not the top of the birdhouse.
[75:35.06]You think I'm fucking dumb?
[75:40.78]I do need water for this.
[75:43.92]It'll make it spread easier.
[75:52.01]Could they have given me anything besides like the bridge cleaning dental device?
[75:58.11]You know what I mean?
[75:58.59]Like, let me clean into my dentures.
[76:05.68]This is one of those fancy flosses that nobody uses.
[76:12.12]Am I doing this right?
[76:15.62]But I can't be done after, I have to decorate it.
[76:17.92]I have to write sayings on it.
[76:20.48]Like, I've got a couple of frags, you know what I mean?
[76:24.50]Because it's a gamer birdhouse.
[76:31.62]This is already drying.
[76:35.92]Give me that house!
[76:38.85]No, this is for the birds.
[76:42.37]This is not for you.
[76:44.35]Not for me either.
[76:47.40]It's for next week's recycling.
[76:58.97]I mean, yeah, burn houses.
[77:06.38]I don't like the way this looks.
[77:07.44]I need like a brighter light on here.
[77:09.04]Give me this fucking sun.
[77:12.12]There we go.
[77:12.70]Now you guys can see.
[77:13.60]Look at how much better that is.
[77:16.47]You can give me like some tips and some pointers.
[77:21.27]Get over here.
[77:24.73]Although that, don't drop a fucking expensive light.
[77:28.95]Why are you like this light?
[77:30.45]Stop!
[77:33.38]Oh my god, will you please just fucking stop?
[77:36.40]There, that's better.
[77:37.10]I mean, I'm like blowing up my face huge, but... This is for you guys to be able to see the colors here.
[77:47.99]Was this... What?
[77:49.05]Hold on.
[77:50.75]I gotta like change the settings here, because this is blowing me out.
[77:57.44]That's better.
[77:59.80]Hey, look at that.
[78:00.40]That's better.
[78:00.86]Now I don't look, well, I don't, I don't have paint on my hands, right?
[78:03.98]I already have enough fucking hair problems.
[78:08.60]Okay, here we go.
[78:16.81]So what did that guy, Jerma985, is it Jeremy985?
[78:20.01]What's his name on Twitch?
[78:22.21]Yeah, yeah, no, you had it right, man.
[78:24.24]You watch that guy?
[78:25.80]Yeah, I mean, I check his stream out every now and then.
[78:27.74]Like, sometimes he's playing something cool or he's doing something.
[78:30.39]I'm like, oh, yeah, I'm, like, a fan.
[78:32.39]Oh, really?
[78:32.83]What's he doing now?
[78:33.63]Oh, dude, probably something really fucking cool.
[78:35.89]Like, you've never heard of him before?
[78:37.99]No, never.
[78:39.05]What is he?
[78:40.03]Yeah, I'll check him out.
[78:41.08]Yeah, right now he's, uh... I just saw what he was doing.
[78:45.94]Uh, no, you know, man, let's, uh... You want to, like, get in the lobby and, like, play Overwatch or something, man?
[78:51.11]No, no, I'm gonna check this guy out.
[78:52.33]You're like a fan of him.
[78:53.37]Yeah, I want to see what he's doing.
[78:54.49]Yeah, no, no, no, we should like go.
[78:55.98]I gotta go though.
[78:57.30]Like, hey, do you want a free Steam game?
[79:01.24]Yeah, dude, free Steam game.
[79:02.22]What are you talking about?
[79:02.92]Yeah, just pick a game that you want and just like don't open that page.
[79:06.53]Because like I think Twitch is fucking broken or something.
[79:08.27]Twitch is fucked up.
[79:16.94]Yeah, man, I'll have to check him out some other time.
[79:18.34]Yeah, some other time.
[79:19.07]Like, I mean, he's live.
[79:20.69]He's live, like, sometimes.
[79:21.69]And he's live.
[79:22.53]He plays.
[79:23.97]He's like, alright, though.
[79:28.39]It's not today.
[79:30.19]Not today, Dan.
[79:34.06]Look at that.
[79:34.74]Perfect coat of fucking paint.
[79:37.32]It almost makes me want to just grab it and fucking smear my hands on it.
[79:41.78]Alright.
[79:42.06]So now, how do we wait till this dries?
[79:47.29]I didn't think this through.
[79:53.34]I'm not gonna do a second coat.
[79:58.80]No, I gotta get the edges.
[80:07.85]this is kind of relaxing sometimes listen listen to me okay sometimes you like we do little relaxing fun little relaxing streams you know not every stream has to be you know something that you share with your friend sometimes we're just gonna relax and then build a birdhouse on stream right this is just one of those relaxing streams that you refuse to tell your friends that exists
[80:36.91]Why do I have this shirt?
[80:37.89]It's Alf, it's an old Alf shirt.
[80:39.31]It was a gift.
[80:42.83]I can't, if I even get one touch of paint on any other place where this is not supposed to be, one pushup.
[80:59.47]Then I'm talking about over the course, if I do it once, it doesn't matter, it doesn't stack.
[81:10.85]Whoa, dude.
[81:11.35]One push-up.
[81:11.79]Yeah, one.
[81:15.23]No, fine.
[81:15.61]We'll make it 100.
[81:15.97]Alright.
[81:24.62]Almost done with the base.
[81:29.30]No, we're not.
[81:29.72]Okay, I've got to be very careful.
[81:32.15]Because this... Oh, no.
[81:34.37]Oh, no, no, no.
[81:35.57]How am I going to get in there?
[81:37.95]This little bit here.
[81:39.47]Don't touch it.
[81:45.44]Alright, have we gotten to a point in the world, right now I'm sitting here thinking, man, I have to like do all this shit by hand.
[81:53.06]If this was just like a building video game, I would put my cursor over this and it would go red and I'd be done.
[82:05.60]I'm just thinking about, man, if I only had like the paint tool and like House Flipper or something.
[82:13.15]This is gonna look really nice when it's done.
[82:15.75]And then you guys can all say that you helped pick out the colors.
[82:20.55]Cause I made this.
[82:22.17]No, I did.
[82:23.21]No, I did.
[82:23.77]No, I did this.
[82:24.39]Okay.
[82:25.91]I need a little bit of water here.
[82:34.98]How am I going to switch color?
[82:39.70]That's why I got to get it all done in one go.
[82:42.56]Whatever color I'm using.
[82:47.46]Don't rush it.
[82:48.78]This is not a video game.
[82:50.62]This is one of those experiments, guys, where we have to have patience.
[82:55.92]Okay?
[82:57.13]Sometimes you gotta bring yourself back to reality.
[83:01.03]Not everything can be done by opening up a Google Doc.
[83:24.18]Google Doc painting well you know what I'm saying not everything can be done with a fucking Google Doc you know back when I was a kid if we wanted if you wanted to like say hello to somebody you know what our Discord chat was the living room and I had to call up on the phone hey what's up man how'd you got all four of us want to get in the room and play ninja turtles yeah it was the living room
[84:05.37]The arcade.
[84:05.97]Yeah, the arcade was awesome.
[84:09.18]The crazy thing about the arcade... We're... We're in this... Like, hear me out on this, right?
[84:15.44]So, it used to be... Back when video games were just becoming very, very popular thing, and arcades still existed.
[84:23.13]Think about, like... Think about the original microtransactions, guys.
[84:29.25]You used to have to pay, like, 50 cents to play a game.
[84:34.25]You'd go in and play Mortal Kombat?
[84:37.39]No, no, that's 50 cents.
[84:38.67]And if you lose, good fucking see you later.
[84:40.83]Give us another 50 cents or you can't play again.
[84:42.55]What do you think they got the idea?
[84:53.97]Not wrong.
[84:54.59]I mean, just think about it.
[84:57.03]And I would go into that arcade with my allowance.
[85:00.49]And I would spend, I would put $20 in that machine.
[85:04.22]And I would spit just 20 bucks and quarters.
[85:09.74]And I would spend it all in a couple hours.
[85:12.42]Alright, hold on, I gotta be careful.
[85:14.38]Make sure there's no bubbles.
[85:17.36]It's gonna be hard with this little toothpick, though.
[85:22.49]Yeah, it was an entertainment vending machine.
[85:23.97]That's a really good way to put it.
[85:31.90]Okay, now I've got all the edges done.
[85:35.94]Now, how am I gonna do this?
[85:41.44]I think I can go underneath like this.
[85:45.18]This is where I gotta be actually careful because as you see, I gotta get right in this little edge, but it's okay, I can paint over it later.
[85:59.13]Play Christmas music?
[86:00.15]It's not Christmas yet.
[86:03.11]It's not close, it's not Christmas yet.
[86:10.91]It's alright, I'm gonna paint over it.
[86:16.12]Not bad, actually.
[86:17.26]Not bad at all.
[86:19.38]Spider on the wall.
[86:23.20]Ah!

[87:03.07]Okay, looking good.
[87:04.93]Looking good, Jeremy.
[87:07.59]Have you been practicing off stream with a paintbrush to make sure you didn't make a fool out of yourself?
[87:13.20]No.
[87:15.04]No, I didn't buy five birdhouses and build them all five times to make sure I knew exactly where the pieces went.
[87:26.18]You know, I'm not like that, guys.
[87:29.84]I'm a genuine streamer.
[87:36.23]I wasn't even paying attention and I didn't fuck it up.
[87:42.78]You know what I could use right now?
[87:46.20]A piece of toast.
[87:49.18]Do I want toast because this is reminding me of toast?
[87:52.23]These pieces.
[87:52.77]This is just bread.
[87:55.57]I'm trying not to eat bread though.
[87:57.55]Trying to stay the fuck away from it.
[88:02.28]Original doom ost I'm not putting on fucking do oh my god.
[88:06.76]Do you want to put on doom for this shit?
[88:09.56]You want me to put that on?
[88:12.02]Is that all you guys list you guys listen to any hook?
[88:14.10]I thought that was an animal on My camera.
[88:17.70]I looked over at the OBS preview and I thought this I Thought this was an animal in my room Anyways
[88:33.26]Do you guys listen to any other songs?
[88:36.30]It's just, hey, I got an idea.
[88:38.28]Doom OST.
[88:40.62]Yeah, that's just what's always on repeat.
[88:43.00]That's what my alarm is.
[88:44.84]I cook to it.
[88:55.25]Although, it's kind of like that with a lot of things.
[88:58.51]Like, I can tell you right now, there are some songs on YouTube especially where I am absolutely at least 10% of every single play.
[89:05.21]Absolutely.
[89:10.93]The little hairs are coming off of this fucking toothbrush.
[89:15.25]Is the bottom dry enough for me to put this down?
[89:22.72]I think it is.
[89:25.28]We got a good coating on it.
[89:28.58]Filled in all the cracks, just this last little bit right here.
[89:32.80]See it?
[89:34.08]Don't worry, I'm gonna get it.
[89:38.56]And then we'll put on the Doom OST.
[89:47.69]How many times have I caved in and just put on the Doom soundtrack?
[89:51.71]I wonder how many times that's actually happened.
[89:57.83]Doom O.S.T.
[90:01.03]Alright, looks good, huh?
[90:03.27]Bang.
[90:04.39]So, can... That shit's dry.
[90:21.55]No, it's not.
[90:22.07]Fuck.
[90:26.36]The edges are like... I've got to spread the edges out.
[90:34.70]I'm bleeding.
[90:35.38]I don't know.
[90:36.92]I cut myself accidentally on the wood.
[90:40.39]That's dry.
[90:41.37]That's just blood.
[90:43.85]It should be a little more alarming.
[90:45.21]Okay, I've got to...
[91:06.60]I'm gonna pass out.
[91:07.28]Don't do that.
[91:22.01]Okay.
[91:24.87]Uh, I think it's good?
[91:28.90]Look, I don't cut all day, okay?
[91:31.02]It's good!
[91:33.50]Wash it off in the machinima, oh yeah baby!
[91:36.26]Oh, look at that!
[91:40.34]Oh, I got this cool, awesome new drink idea!

[91:46.18]What's in there, man?
[91:47.14]Oh, we got... We got... Triple sec... Uh, rum...
[91:54.15]Some watermelon juice.
[91:57.85]It's the machinima slam.
[92:00.49]Yeah, you won't do it.
[92:04.11]I need another color now, right?
[92:11.61]No, I'm fine, right?
[92:12.55]Is this going to be dirty?
[92:16.86]Because that's, we're done with the red.
[92:18.36]I see one little spot right there.
[92:19.64]Let me just get it.
[92:23.59]Should this be in arts and crafts now?
[92:27.03]Am I in the wrong category?
[92:29.52]This is just like, I need to be in like arts and crafts.
[92:34.92]How do I do that?
[92:36.42]Arts and crafts.
[92:41.56]Art.
[92:43.50]This is not art though.
[92:47.86]This is not art.
[92:49.36]This is like, this is like offensive.
[92:53.57]I'm an art streamer.
[92:55.23]Look at me.
[92:56.27]I'm painting a birdhouse.
[93:03.89]Creative?
[93:04.87]There's no... Creative?
[93:06.31]Destruction.
[93:09.35]Go under body painting.
[93:12.29]I'm not going to go under body painting.
[93:18.71]Crafting?
[93:19.53]I just... I don't...
[93:27.13]What about like birdhouses?
[93:29.51]Is there a birdhouse category?
[93:34.87]God damn it.
[93:36.65]I'll just have to go into art.
[93:41.06]Okay, how about building a birdhouse in parentheses, don't watch this stream.
[93:44.30]It's not, don't watch it.
[93:45.78]Don't tell your friends about it.
[93:47.38]No, that's like a reverse psychology.
[93:48.78]Like, oh, don't watch this, man.
[93:57.52]Whatever, building a birdhouse.
[94:01.10]I was in just chatting before, but we're like just chatting building a birdhouse.
[94:10.74]Alright, here we go.
[94:11.96]I did not forget about the Doom OST.
[94:15.90]I can't fucking believe I'm putting this on.
[94:33.14]Give me a second.
[94:37.24]He chose the path of perpetual torment.
[94:42.64]Don't drink that!
[94:43.50]In ravenous hatred, he found no peace, and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains, seeking vengeance against the Dark Lords who had wronged him.
[94:58.23]And those that tasted the bite of his sword
[95:05.53]Slit.
[95:41.69]Welcome to the fucking Satan stream.
[95:44.44]Whoa!
[95:46.20]Why am I made out of plastic?
[95:49.60]I swear to God, I don't look like this.
[95:53.00]I don't look like this.
[95:56.14]That's so strange.
[95:57.75]This is something to do with the lighting, I can promise you.
[96:00.07]I'm not, like, greasy.
[96:01.49]This is... I didn't just paint my face.
[96:07.58]I just painted my face.
[96:09.18]That's what I did.
[96:09.72]I painted my face red.
[96:25.67]I can't even see.
[96:26.57]I need to do paint.
[96:30.56]Hold on.
[96:30.90]Just hold on a minute.
[96:31.90]I'll be right back.
[97:51.00]Dude, it fucking stinks in this room.
[97:52.97]I don't know why.
[97:54.57]It smells like old... old, like, rubber mats.
[98:00.99]I don't understand why that is.
[98:02.09]Alright.
[98:05.79]Back to... back to our Doom birdhouse.
[98:09.14]So, it was all blue, right?
[98:10.88]Blue everywhere, on all the sides.
[98:14.16]Out in the back.
[98:15.52]Right?
[98:20.80]Or should we just do fucking red?
[98:22.30]Let me close red.
[98:24.48]We don't need it anymore.
[98:28.25]Give us the old boom.
[98:30.59]The old doom.
[98:32.97]Doom... No, I'm not doing all red.
[98:39.31]We already voted on it.
[98:41.01]All blue up top.
[98:43.87]I can't fucking see, though.
[98:45.45]This is hard to see.
[98:46.73]I can't read this.
[98:51.69]This is the, it doesn't, it's messing with my brain, it's the wrong color.
[98:57.65]See, you guys, we can't, that looks like black.
[99:01.99]I'm gonna change the, the screen back to normal in a minute here.
[99:04.65]That's right.
[99:17.00]We're building a fucking birdhouse.
[99:25.75]I need more than that, I gotta get like a lot on there.
[99:29.45]Not doing more than one coat, just get it on there.
[99:33.10]This actually is kind of working like a blacklight, so I can see exactly where I haven't painted.
[99:40.82]You wanna put on the boom doom?
[99:42.89]Boomer doom?
[99:51.97]Yes, I'll put on Boomer Doom in a little bit.
[99:54.88]Let me get one panel with the original Doom new boom soundtrack.
[100:01.06]The new boom, you know what I mean?
[100:07.55]It's alright, if that's... I splattered it a little bit.
[100:10.65]What if we did like a cool thing where it was like... Never mind, shut the fuck up, Jeremy.
[100:16.18]Whoa.
[100:28.61]Alright, so anybody that comes in from, like, the art category, we need to just tell them that I did all this by hand.
[100:36.07]Like, I crafted the wood myself.
[100:39.02]I, like, cut it.
[100:39.78]I, like, did it with my bare hands.
[100:49.34]When this is done, I know a lot of people might be taking a little bit of jokes and talking shit, but you are going to wish you had this birdhouse when it's done.
[101:00.62]which won't be very long from now.
[101:01.96]Alright, this, okay, can I stop the boom joke?
[101:07.28]The doom joke?
[101:09.04]Alright, hold on.
[101:10.22]I'm gonna like move out of the way so I can make sure I, cause I need to see it from afar so I can make sure the lights are correct.
[101:22.69]There we go.
[101:23.43]Hey, now we can actually see what we're doing.
[101:39.64]It's purple, but it's but we're on Twitch who gives a shit.
[101:42.66]That's my excuse So original doom Original Doom OST Okay
[102:07.23]This is from- this is the original Doom soundtrack.
[102:14.26]I'm gonna put it low in the background, because I don't want it to be- I don't want it to take over the stream.
[102:19.42]Not like it matters.
[102:26.72]What- what happened here?
[102:27.90]Why is it yellow?
[102:32.98]Sonic the Boom House.
[102:35.34]Sonic the Bird House.
[102:38.53]Sonic the boom-hus you guys got me saying boom and boomer and shit.
[102:43.15]I don't know who came up with that Some television show of course bring it we contribute it back to TV shows I
[103:31.13]Someone just says, stop.
[103:36.01]Stop doing what you're doing, Rao, please.
[103:37.55]I don't need any more paint than this.
[103:44.74]This is a little too much.
[103:48.43]This is a cute little birdhouse.
[103:50.37]Don't you think so?
[104:14.35]What?
[104:16.11]What's wrong with you guys?
[104:17.13]Calm down.
[104:27.06]I feel like I've been doing the same motion for five minutes straight.
[104:44.06]Fucking just move on already, man.
[104:47.70]Swirl it in the holes.
[104:53.41]Look, it is perfect.
[104:58.09]It is perfect.
[105:02.33]I'm not doing it again, don't worry.
[105:04.93]I had at least a thousand people just fucking clicked mute wicked fast right there.
[105:17.15]Somebody was like, I had a sandwich, and they like fucking dropped this sandwich.
[105:19.61]Fucking god damn it, dude.
[105:21.61]Jeremy, what the fuck?
[105:26.55]Like a food all over the floor.
[105:27.63]Right now they're cleaning that all up.
[105:29.27]And it's my fault.
[105:30.89]And it is.
[105:36.07]Somebody's on their hands and knees right now.
[105:37.77]Because they dropped like a fucking bowl of macaroni and cheese on the ground.
[105:41.85]Because they thought I was going to be really loud again.
[105:50.32]Okay, this is turning into more of a Super Mario house than it is a Sonic the Hedgehog house.
[105:54.37]I'm gonna have to finish it up by drawing his face on the front.
[105:59.83]Right?
[106:01.17]Alright, that looks good.
[106:02.09]We're completely coated on the front.
[106:06.46]Same thing on this side.
[106:07.40]Let's get a little bit of water on there to loosen it up.
[106:20.25]You know what I could really go for right now?
[106:24.15]I'm a slammer.
[106:27.78]Triple sec, rum, watermelon puree.
[106:34.56]Really craving one right now.
[106:41.93]I could probably do this better with my hands, but I'm not going to because then what do I do with my hands?
[106:50.41]What am I supposed to do with the hands after that?
[106:59.34]Paint.
[107:00.00]Okay, so if I dunk my hand in here and smear it all over there and do it in five seconds... Okay, that's great.
[107:06.79]Then what am I supposed to do with my hands?
[107:09.85]I can't leave the room.
[107:10.99]I would have to sit here until... I would have to scream for help.
[107:18.59]What, am I gonna grab the doorknob with paint all over my hands?
[107:21.48]Wipe it all over my nice shirt?
[107:25.06]You know?
[107:31.11]All you guys that are talking shit right now about this shirt, keep in mind, I put this shirt on because it's like a shitty shirt.
[107:37.73]And if I got paint on it, it wouldn't be the end of the world.
[107:41.42]When you paint, you wear painting clothes that you know you don't care about.
[107:45.16]But I care a lot about this shirt.
[107:46.66]This was a gift from my mother.
[107:49.20]And it means a fucking lot to me.
[107:51.34]So I'm not getting paint on it.
[107:53.35]She gave it to me a long time ago and it's a really great fucking gift and I don't want to ruin it.
[108:02.85]So was the table.
[108:03.75]But do you understand?
[108:06.15]I... No.
[108:07.81]Don't go that far.
[108:17.07]Your shirt is amazing, sweetie.
[108:18.41]Thanks, Mom.
[108:21.65]Thanks a lot, Mom.
[108:22.91]I appreciate it.
[108:26.83]Running out of blue paint, just to let you guys know.
[108:30.37]We're getting down to the bottom.
[108:41.94]God, oddly satisfying.
[108:45.75]Like, yeah.
[108:47.37]Watching him paint that, pfft, oddly... You know what I'm saying?
[108:54.61]Was it Dev in the chat?
[108:57.07]Dude, love your birdhouses, man.
[109:01.06]Can you confirm for the viewers here?
[109:04.90]First of all, yeah, I mean, I think the release went really well.
[109:08.94]But can you confirm, just, I just was curious, is there something about the, in the factory, the way that they cut the pieces?
[109:16.16]Because some of the pieces weren't matched up correctly, but I mean, you can't, come on, it's day one, bugs, you can't get over bugs on day one.
[109:22.56]So I understand, but.
[109:29.38]Is it going to be, yeah, day one bug, like there was a bug in here when I put it up on the first day.
[109:33.54]Because I've had birdhouses from the same company before.
[109:40.19]But, I mean, it's still a problem, I think.
[109:44.65]Alright, so this is almost done here, and then we can do some finesse work.
[109:47.95]And then I'm gonna add the icing.
[109:50.87]I don't give a shit if this is supposed to be a Sonic the Hedgehog house.
[109:53.11]He's getting icing all over his head.
[109:55.68]What else am I supposed to do with the globe?
[110:00.58]This is Christmas Sonic the Hedgehog.
[110:07.23]I gotta really thin this out.
[110:08.90]The blue is going away.
[110:10.14]I don't have very much and I have to do the whole rest of the house.
[110:16.32]Any art people in here that know how to do that?
[110:17.70]How do I like make this go further?
[110:21.68]Can I put like olive oil in there?
[110:30.61]Paint thinner.
[110:33.01]Easier said than done when you can't see.
[110:34.53]This wood eats it up.
[110:35.63]It drinks it up, man.
[110:37.95]Yeah, something about your walls are just drinking up the paint.
[110:41.28]That's why it's going to take us a couple more days.
[110:45.34]Yeah, we put a coat on.
[110:46.92]Your walls just fucking drank the thing up.
[110:49.00]You know, we're going to give us like four more coats.
[110:52.21]That'll be like $425.
[110:52.67]But, you know, your walls, man, they just fucking drink it up.
[111:03.07]Alright, it looks good.
[111:05.17]Pretty decent.
[111:06.01]I thought we were missing a little bit down here.
[111:10.71]Paint, put less on your brush at a time.
[111:20.70]That's a good idea!
[111:25.54]But you see what I'm saying?
[111:26.18]Look at the edge here.
[111:27.36]I mean your fucking walls just fucking drinking up though.
[111:34.86]Alright, that looks fine.
[111:35.46]Let's see if we can get away with this.
[111:53.73]Not getting away with it.
[111:55.21]This is the hard part, because this is where the little divots are.
[112:05.26]Shit, I gotta go underneath.
[112:07.74]Can underneath be white?
[112:10.44]Guys, do you care about that underneath is white?
[112:17.05]No, no, it can't be white.
[112:19.45]Why can't I have the underneath be white?
[112:20.79]Because it's Sonic, but whatever.
[112:34.31]Doesn't Sonic have, like, white frosted tips?
[112:36.71]Or is that his, like... No, that's his, like, weird cousin, right?
[112:42.31]Who's the Sonic the Hedgehog with the frosted tips?
[112:50.78]There really is one.
[112:51.90]Silver.
[112:54.24]Silver the time-traveling hedgehog, right?
[112:59.80]He went over real well.
[113:01.36]Didn't see him in another fucking game.
[113:03.70]Alright.
[113:05.77]Why didn't anybody tell me that I was dripping?
[113:09.83]I can use that later though.
[113:10.75]I have to wait till this dries to do that part.
[113:20.30]So the front is white.
[113:24.68]Alright, this is going a little bit further than I thought on the edge here, because this is a smooth edge.
[113:33.53]Looking kind of good.
[113:35.72]Lookin' kinda good.
[113:43.99]Looks good.
[113:44.69]It worked.
[113:46.21]Now we're just gonna do that on all sides.
[113:48.43]Thankfully the blue is gone after this.
[113:49.89]I have plenty of yellow too.
[113:51.31]Can I just make his whole body yellow?
[113:53.73]You guys are not really gonna care that much.
[113:59.01]No one is gonna care that much if his body is fuckin' yellow.
[114:10.32]No, no, no, no.
[114:11.66]Alright, my god.
[114:14.72]And why do I care?
[114:15.64]Like, the bird that's gonna live in this house is not gonna worry about if his house looks like Sonic the Hedgehog.
[114:22.45]He doesn't know what that is.
[114:23.19]He's a bird.
[114:26.25]Birds don't play video games.
[114:28.14]No matter what Falco tries to tell you.
[114:39.94]It's Falco's house.
[114:41.08]No, it's not Falco.
[114:42.10]Well, it could be.
[114:45.20]Guys, are you starting to realize that every fucking video game character is the same color scheme?
[114:49.58]Are you figuring this out yet?
[114:51.86]Think of a video game character right now in your head.
[114:54.71]Are they... Are they red and blue?
[115:01.65]Yes, they are.
[115:06.17]No, no.
[115:07.35]Doomguy.
[115:07.93]Doomguy is red and blue.
[115:10.53]Look it up.
[115:11.89]Somebody said Link.
[115:13.51]The game on the DS with the four of the links and one of them is blue and red.
[115:20.41]Metroid.
[115:21.49]Samus is blue and red.
[115:29.58]Pac-Man is yellow.
[115:41.31]Donkey Kong.
[115:42.63]His tie is blue and red.
[115:45.77]Red tie with a blue DK on it.
[115:48.37]Oh, I'm almost out of fucking paint.
[116:03.71]Oh, this has got to make this go longer.
[116:10.27]Captain America, blue and red.
[116:14.65]Spider-Man, blue and red.
[116:16.25]Thor, blue and red.
[116:18.87]Iron Man, red with a little bit of blue and a small orange for his eyes.
[116:39.08]Heinz tomato ketchup.
[116:41.02]The weird blue bottle.
[116:42.56]And it's red.
[116:43.44]And they did a blue- they did a blue version of it too.
[116:45.38]Remember the gross blue one that nobody wanted?
[116:47.20]Blue and red.
[117:04.51]What the fuck was that noise?
[117:09.57]Jerma985.
[117:10.19]Well, you're probably thinking, Jerma, your colors are not... Oh, wait, they're blue and red.
[117:18.58]They're like teal, and they're like a version of that.
[117:29.52]Okay, looks good.
[117:31.49]Did I get some on me?
[117:32.21]No.
[117:32.85]Alright, we're getting to the point...
[117:36.83]Where I need, I still have blue, I still need to do blue.
[117:38.91]Just gotta do the back.
[117:41.01]Wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[117:43.11]Only the front is white, right?
[117:45.62]Front is white, the sides are blue, the back is blue.
[117:50.32]Is that correct?
[117:52.38]Right, he's right, okay, right, right, right.
[117:55.89]I need to spread this out a lot.
[118:11.03]Because I did heavy, heavy-handed coats on the top.
[118:17.07]And this children's toy only gives you two teaspoons of paint.
[118:35.38]There we go.
[118:36.16]Nice and liquidy.
[118:46.53]Blue is white.
[118:47.49]Yeah, white's in the front.
[118:49.01]Blue's in the back.
[119:10.06]It's not a big deal!
[119:11.02]Like, I didn't just get... What the fuck is wrong with me?
[119:13.50]I can fix it later.
[119:16.91]That was a horrible jump scare in a horror game.
[119:20.35]No!
[119:21.09]I painted blue on the red!
[119:32.30]Whatever will I do?
[119:45.52]Okay.
[119:47.00]Do I have enough?
[119:49.30]I think I might have just enough, just barely.
[119:59.09]Can I get underneath here?
[120:00.09]Good thing the whole thing is blue.
[120:02.51]You guys really didn't make it that hard for me.
[120:05.00]If you guys had made the sides yellow, the top blue, the corner red, you guys really just said blue house.
[120:12.24]Do whole house blue.
[120:15.13]You made it pretty easy for me.
[120:16.47]Thanks guys, I appreciate it.
[120:22.73]Pay up with those pushups, baby arms.
[120:25.56]What did I say, I was gonna do one?
[120:28.28]I can't put this down.
[120:31.62]Don't you realize this?
[120:32.48]I cannot put this down.
[120:39.55]You're gonna have to wait a minute.
[120:42.43]Just remember that.
[120:44.71]They won't.
[120:51.67]That is top dry.
[120:56.59]Not really.
[120:57.03]Gotta spread that shit out, man.
[121:07.44]This blue paint fucking everywhere.
[121:09.90]Thanks, mom, for the fucking desk.
[121:17.25]I have to put this down.
[121:18.45]Alright, now I gotta do... I can't hold it.
[121:42.96]I didn't think this through at all.
[121:46.97]Get out of the way, machinima.
[121:55.98]That table is now fucked up.
[121:57.34]No, it's a memory that I'll never lose.
[121:59.52]I always will remember the day that we all built a birdhouse together.
[122:05.58]You know what I mean?
[122:12.24]Remember that time that he built a birdhouse and we were all there screaming and cheering him on?
[122:25.79]You got to the finish line.
[122:29.62]I'm just... Okay, I gotta... Just pick it up.
[122:31.76]Just rip off the band-aid and pick the fucking thing up.
[122:53.47]I'm out of fucking paint.
[122:55.61]Why wouldn't they give me like triple the amount that's in here?
[123:00.03]Who made this?
[123:00.53]I did.
[123:02.99]I made this.
[123:03.54]Me.
[123:03.92]I did.
[123:04.44]I did this.
[123:04.96]Me.
[123:05.26]I did this.
[123:06.66]Me.
[123:07.00]I did this.
[123:21.27]Change the OST.
[123:29.78]Hold on.
[123:30.30]I just got to fill it in good enough.
[123:34.23]It's a whole other side that I have to do and I don't have any more blue.
[123:36.87]We're going to have to desperate times call for desperate measures because this is not going to work anymore like this.
[124:15.63]Thing is fucking empty.
[124:24.27]Blue.
[124:24.89]Everything has to be blue.
[124:30.32]I'm on the desk, right?
[124:31.18]Alright, okay, good.
[124:40.49]The top is so good and the fucking god damn it.
[124:44.67]Mix the other colors.
[124:48.93]I can't make blue with yellow and red.
[124:52.11]I can't make blue with white and yellow.
[125:01.78]How do you make blue?
[125:04.92]Go buy more paint.
[125:05.98]Use a blue marker.
[125:09.07]I don't think I even have a blue marker.
[125:11.66]No, I can work with this, just wait.
[125:35.42]This soundtrack sounds like shit, by the way.
[125:37.95]I can't, it's not, my headphones aren't in, but all I can hear is like, and I'm, does that, that must sound fucking terrible.
[125:59.43]Almost.
[126:00.55]And then we just deal with the consequences.
[126:10.76]I got it.
[126:11.78]It's over man.
[126:12.68]I got it I'm gonna be good to go.
[126:16.41]What that was so unnecessary.
[126:17.79]Just put just add water And then swirl it up And that's perfect.
[126:28.66]We're good.
[126:30.70]I Can touch up bullshit later.
[126:32.96]Just wanna make sure it's coated.
[126:33.86]Oh
[126:40.62]Look at that.
[126:40.94]Doesn't that make you feel fucking great?
[126:45.64]Okay, is a robot singing right now?
[126:47.26]I can't tell.
[126:53.15]Is there lyrics to this song?
[126:55.77]No.
[126:55.95]Okay.
[127:08.14]Dude, ah, man, you know what I'm craving right now?
[127:11.34]The new fuckin' drink from Machinima!
[127:14.56]Bacardi 151, top it off with a little bit of rum chata.
[127:18.87]Underneath that, a layer of fuckin' orange juice, and then blue food coloring.
[127:52.71]Alright, almost done.
[127:58.23]See?
[127:58.65]We stretched it out.
[128:00.41]We stretched it out, guys!
[128:01.65]We made it!
[128:02.41]We stretched it out and we did it!
[128:11.64]Crisis averted.
[128:12.38]Nice and blue.
[128:19.76]Just have to take care of the edges, but that's fine.
[128:23.12]The touch-up work can come later, because I'm going to use the white to do little touch-ups.
[128:29.68]And I did not think in a fucking trillion years that the birdhouse room was going to be more than two hours.
[128:41.57]Not in a fucking million years.
[128:46.15]I would have taken the bet last night if you said this was going to take 15 minutes.
[128:59.12]Nah, dude, that's gonna take like 15 fucking minutes.
[129:01.76]Alright.
[129:08.12]Good?
[129:09.61]Gotta get the underside here.
[129:11.35]Or do we really even need to?
[129:13.73]Oh, fuck you, Jeremy.
[129:14.91]You touched it and it's ruined now.
[129:16.63]How am I ever gonna win the fucking birdhouse contest?
[129:41.70]Just gotta get a little bit here and then the blue is done and I can finally- it's empty empty empty actually empty actually literally physically literally physically fucking actually empty, you know?
[129:58.59]This is a pretty good Splatoon song.
[130:11.56]What's wrong?
[130:13.03]The roof?
[130:13.51]What's wrong with the roof?
[130:14.25]The roof is a design choice.
[130:17.19]No, well, it's the reverse of the design choice.
[130:18.97]Alright, that looks a lot cleaner.
[130:32.09]So it was supposed to be shade for the bird, but we ran into a little problem where it looked so cool if it was wind blowing against the house's hair.
[130:42.61]So we just said, cool, man.
[130:44.36]We decided to do that instead.
[130:48.80]Needs to be a thicker amount of paint here, and then we move on to the white.
[130:53.10]I'm gonna take the nub out.
[130:59.59]That looks like shit.
[131:01.59]I'm not happy with that at all.
[131:02.67]This is goddamn art, man.
[131:06.69]It's gotta be the way that I want it.
[131:23.87]Done.
[131:26.23]It looks fucking horrible back here.
[131:29.80]What like fucking pizza delivery music is this?
[131:35.23]Is this actually Doom?
[131:50.69]Okay.
[131:51.83]Done.
[131:53.15]All sides are done.
[131:56.79]Blue, blue.
[131:57.87]It's not perfect over here.
[132:04.71]See that you see like the faint.
[132:17.58]Done.
[132:19.18]There it is.
[132:20.08]Now we just need to... I need to wash my fucking hands.
[132:27.17]I can't touch... See, this is the problem that I knew was going to happen.
[132:30.29]Why didn't you... Why did you let me do this?
[132:32.27]Why did you guys let me do this?
[132:33.21]Because now I can't leave the room.
[132:36.43]I can't touch anything over here because I don't want to get paint on my fucking mouse.
[135:09.07]back okay close this wait this is paint all over this I'm not touching that ever again just open the white alright front this is it still is drying so I can't really touch it is there ost still playing don't touch your mouse you're fine
[135:36.11]Okay, uh, what other OST?
[135:38.71]Something like relaxing, something we can just chill to.
[135:44.07]Sonic OST.
[135:52.19]Sonic Mania.
[135:53.93]Complete soundtrack.
[135:54.89]Is it playing?
[136:19.97]Sonic the Hedgehog Sonic Mania OST Sonic Heroes OST Guys, it's so hard to decipher because there's like 400 Sonic games Okay, I have to hold it by this thing
[136:43.05]Yeah.
[137:21.72]I gotta use a lot because it's not showing up.
[137:29.65]This just looks like glue.
[137:31.65]Paste.
[137:34.85]This looks so fucking bad.
[137:39.00]What's with this color opacity here?
[137:41.04]What's with the pigment?
[137:49.93]This pigment sucks.
[137:53.36]Dump the whole thing on there.
[137:54.76]No, because then it'll never dry.
[137:56.04]How am I ever supposed to draw Sonic the Hedgehog's fucking shitty face on here?
[138:14.72]I'm so mad right now.
[138:16.06]This was looking kind of good.
[138:18.44]And now the white paint just ruined it.
[138:26.43]It doesn't even show up through the wood.
[138:27.81]I'm gonna have to do like five coats.
[138:37.68]Mix in the glue.
[138:39.72]But I need this for the, I don't, not, not yet.
[138:41.68]That's, that is absolute last resort.
[138:49.81]This needs to dry.
[138:54.34]And then we can figure out a fucking absolute last resort plan.
[138:58.64]If it doesn't work.
[139:04.34]How come all the other paints were so good, but this one was terrible?
[139:09.03]This is not even trying to be paint.
[139:11.21]Um, I actually, I'm pretty certain this is not even his paint.
[139:13.27]This is not even paint.
[139:18.85]Absolutely not paint.
[139:19.87]Fucking bullshit.
[139:21.45]This looks terrible.
[139:25.63]Why even put this color in here?
[139:27.29]You know what I mean?
[139:28.41]Why, instead of white, why don't it give like orange or brown or green?
[139:33.58]Where's green?
[139:34.44]You put a white that just doesn't work?
[139:54.34]I need layers, but I don't have enough to do that many layers.
[139:57.14]I really should just put fucking frosting on here.
[140:04.50]That's what it looks like.
[140:06.02]Are you fucking kidding me?
[140:14.66]It is frosting.
[140:28.72]What color are Sonic's eyes?
[140:29.62]Look at this, up close.
[140:42.85]That's just powder.
[140:45.66]Baking soda on the front of this thing.
[140:57.70]I guess we could do the nose, and then paint over it again.
[141:09.85]It's gotta dry, and then we'll do it again.
[141:11.25]Alright, so let me do some, let me do some little bit of, alright, so this, now that I have a minute here, let's do the icing.
[141:19.36]Because this, this is done up top here.
[141:21.84]So what do you think, like, horizontal?
[141:24.84]Vertical?
[141:27.52]What do you guys think?
[141:29.24]I would say probably horizontal, like this.
[141:38.38]Just a little bit, so it's festive.
[141:40.09]What do you mean?
[141:40.85]Those are the spikes!
[141:41.93]It's spikes!
[141:44.11]How have you not figured this out yet?
[141:45.57]I gotta go like spikes.
[141:47.63]Spikes.
[141:56.41]Don't ruin it.
[142:00.29]Oh, yeah.
[142:01.63]Don't ruin it.
[142:03.15]Don't ruin this fucking great piece of work here.
[142:09.65]Don't ruin it.
[142:13.02]Hey.
[142:13.38]Why was I saying hey?
[142:16.30]Hey.
[142:18.16]Oops.
[142:18.98]I accidentally just turned off Sonic the Hedgehog.
[142:22.46]Sonic... What was it?
[142:23.42]Sonic Heroes you wanted to
[142:26.05]Sonic Heroes OST.
[142:28.19]Alright.
[142:46.24]I gotta dry this quicker.
[142:55.26]I fucked it up.
[142:56.06]I was going to sing it, but I can't hear it.
[142:58.00]I was going to lip sync it.
[143:08.19]Whatever.
[143:09.69]Alright, let's try another.
[143:17.73]I'm going to see if I can fit something in there afterwards.
[143:26.32]Sharpie?
[143:26.74]I don't think I even have a Sharpie that'll do that.
[143:30.70]Let's try another coat.
[143:35.86]No, it just clumps up and you can't even see it.
[143:39.34]Whatever, Sonic's face is a little patchy, right?
[143:49.71]He's gonna have like a fucking goatee anyways.
[143:51.49]Sonic has like a big goatee, right?
[143:55.15]He is an animal.
[143:55.79]He is a hedgehog.
[143:56.43]Why would he not have a fur there?
[143:57.47]This is fur.
[143:58.09]That's perfect.
[143:58.65]Okay, that's fine.
[143:59.51]I'm okay with this.
[144:04.03]It's not going to get any better than this.
[144:08.88]I mean the stream, by the way.
[144:10.82]Fucking goddammit.
[144:27.83]This really doesn't do anything.
[144:29.03]Okay, I'm gonna have to- it's time for glue.
[144:30.45]Let me just see what it looks like.
[144:32.29]I'll try it in one spot.
[144:45.94]Doesn't seem to be helping much.
[144:54.31]But!
[144:55.24]Here's what I'm gonna do with the glue.
[144:57.16]I'm gonna draw his face with the glue.
[145:00.58]That's right.
[145:01.02]Because I'm gonna mix in some blue into this bottle.
[145:05.72]I'm gonna shake it up and I'm gonna draw his face.
[145:07.75]This actually is working somehow.
[145:19.80]It's almost forcing the paint to clump together so it makes an actual patch.
[145:28.36]Like, don't you remember the- you guys have seen the videos where the guys make the pancake art?
[145:31.96]It's gonna be like that.
[145:33.34]Except just forget about the pancake part.
[145:38.69]Figured out what was wrong, by the way, everybody.
[145:40.97]Everybody's gonna freak out, but I... I should have painted the whole thing red, and then I would have painted over the paint white.
[146:03.67]Because look what's happening with it.
[146:04.79]Look down here.
[146:05.99]See how this is actually coming up?
[146:07.99]It's coming up white.
[146:09.49]Rather than this weird fucking puke.
[146:12.71]I can't even say it.
[146:27.55]Start it over.
[146:28.31]No.
[146:28.79]I want to get to the design.
[146:30.00]That's the best part.
[146:33.96]So I need to put blue.
[146:37.26]I need a picture of Sonic.
[146:38.20]Okay, turn the shitty fucking music off.
[146:40.28]It's not shitty, it's okay.
[146:42.18]For like a 2003 game.
[146:42.86]Alright, Sonic.
[146:45.72]Sonic.
[146:47.72]What does he look like?
[146:49.16]What does Sonic look like?
[146:52.95]Alright.
[146:54.49]You guys made me do this all wrong.
[146:57.67]Why did you make me do it like this?
[147:00.48]It needs to be blue down to here, eyes, and then it's a yellow here.
[147:13.09]Alright, so I need yellow.
[147:18.53]Might as well paint the stick here.
[147:21.65]We're so sorry.
[147:23.23]Don't be sorry, I'm just kidding.
[147:25.83]Alright, white doesn't matter because it doesn't stick to anything, so we just need to paint this thing yellow.
[147:39.52]This one sucks too.
[147:40.34]Whatever.
[148:00.38]Alright, look at that.
[148:01.36]Would you look at that?
[148:02.34]It's almost completely done.
[148:06.38]Just got here.
[148:06.88]How shitfaced is Jerma?
[148:09.26]I mean, not really.
[148:10.60]I've only been drinking these Machinima drinks.
[148:14.34]Like the latest one.
[148:18.34]The fucking Moo Machine.
[148:21.24]This is vodka, cream, heavy cream that is, and then two droplets of fucking hot sauce.
[148:33.87]It's called the Crazy Fucking Cow from Machinima.
[148:47.54]Alright, I'm done with this.
[148:48.46]And we're gonna put the chain on.
[148:51.28]And I'm gonna hang it.
[148:59.09]You won't be able to see the hanging, because that's not gonna, alright, well, there we go.
[149:03.55]I gotta fix the red down there.
[149:06.97]Do the face, the face is gonna be very, very much less.
[149:16.38]And then I gotta do push-ups.
[149:17.30]Yeah, don't worry, I'll do them.
[149:20.47]It's fine.
[149:20.93]Alright, just need the red to get the bottom.
[149:23.13]Because that's all dry.
[149:24.41]And then I'm gonna paint the Sonic face.
[149:27.95]A bird's... Is this lead paint?
[149:31.42]What is this based off of?
[149:32.26]Is this acrylic?
[149:34.62]Can birds even, like, touch this stuff?
[149:39.16]I feel like a bird can't touch this.
[149:47.53]I feel like the music will hit them so hard when they land in here.
[149:50.80]It'll make them say, oh my lord.
[149:55.80]And then if they go to bird church, they'll be blessed.
[150:01.42]I'll take the minus twos for that.
[150:02.56]That was fucking horrible.
[150:10.27]Alright, hold on.
[150:16.40]Nice coat of red.
[150:18.02]Almost done.
[150:30.53]You guys won't let me put on the icing.
[150:33.71]I'm just going to do it off fucking camera anyway.
[150:37.01]Anyway, thanks for coming to the stream, guys.
[150:38.21]That was a lot of fun.
[150:39.03]And see you later.
[150:39.57]And I'm going to fucking drench it with icing.
[150:47.01]Alright.
[150:55.11]I'm above Bob Ross right now.
[151:01.04]Jesus Christ.
[151:06.84]Alright, one more little coat.
[151:10.58]And I can say that this is ready to dry while I do the face.
[151:17.90]We're ready.
[151:19.40]Seems sturdy, seems like a good fit for any Sonic the Hedgehog bird.
[151:26.24]Let's do the face.
[151:27.94]So let's see if my tactic is gonna be worth doing.
[151:31.84]We'll just do yellow.
[151:33.13]So I need to put yellow paint in this glue jar.
[151:37.73]How am I gonna do that?
[151:46.17]It's got limoncello!
[151:48.43]And it's apple cider!
[151:50.53]And this one's called the Shooter!
[151:52.29]No, never mind.
[152:07.20]I wanted that one.
[152:19.72]He's breaking down.
[152:20.93]No, I'm fine.
[152:21.43]I'm fine.
[152:21.69]I'm good.
[152:21.95]I'm good.
[152:22.15]I'm good.
[152:22.33]Here we go.
[152:22.61]I'm going to get this into there and then we're going to Ster it.
[152:26.71]This is going to be hard because take a look at the little hole there.
[152:30.76]But man, if this works, I will be a fucking genius.
[152:55.29]It's working.
[152:58.17]It's working.
[153:01.35]Everybody thought I was insane.
[153:06.92]That's not gonna work, Jeremy.
[153:08.40]Oh, really?
[153:10.56]Take a look at my science.
[153:16.39]Almost there.
[153:26.07]And I'm going to put the cap back on.
[153:30.77]Don't just... Why am I showing this to you guys?
[153:33.18]It's not that important.
[153:43.60]There we go.
[153:45.42]It is a nice dyed yellow.
[153:49.60]Put the cap back on and here we go.
[153:53.49]Check this shit out.
[153:57.44]Alright, Sonic's face.
[154:58.34]His nose is inside of his mouth.
[155:02.50]I can fix it.
[155:03.06]Hold on.
[155:33.30]Well, if it wasn't safe for birds before, it's definitely not safe for them now.
[155:38.69]What'd you use for the paint there?
[155:40.37]Oh, glue.
[155:40.93]This is just plank from Ed, Edd n Eddy.
[156:04.83]I can't put my hands on this.
[156:05.93]I need to put the chain on.
[156:07.30]And I still need to figure out what these fucking two hooks are for.
[156:10.18]Alright.
[156:10.74]One last be right back.
[156:12.10]Hold on.
[156:16.94]Fuck.
[156:20.08]Why did I even shut the door that tight?
[157:06.03]I almost just dumped this.
[158:53.91]Thank you.
[159:49.22]Almost got it open.
[159:50.86]It's close.
[159:57.05]I tried to get it open with my foot.
[159:58.21]I couldn't get it.
[160:00.61]Okay, so we're good, right?
[160:04.39]It moved.
[160:09.61]It moved, huh?
[160:15.25]Listen closely.
[160:15.89]There are screams coming from the birdhouse.
[160:20.05]I don't think I want this in my house.
[160:23.61]You know what I mean?
[160:39.74]No shit, it's a birdhouse.
[160:40.96]Yeah, but I don't think I want this near my house.
[160:45.05]Alright, there you go.
[160:45.59]There's birdhouse.
[160:46.23]Let's get... These hooks are for something.
[160:51.38]Finishing touches.
[160:52.06]And then we smash it!
[161:05.86]Fuck.
[161:13.73]It's a treasure map.
[161:16.67]Three pieces.
[161:18.33]Three pieces.
[161:22.25]That's all I got, three pieces.
[161:23.57]Alright, so... You've created a... Okay, this is a very... Hold on, wait.
[161:29.66]This is a very specific birdhouse for very specific birds.
[161:34.54]Get out of the fucking way, dummy.
[161:37.86]Alright, so this birdhouse is for... Somebody look this up and see if these are in Vegas.
[161:46.07]You've just created a perfect home for chickadees
[161:50.84]Nuthatches and finches.
[161:54.80]Are any of those in Las Vegas?
[162:02.52]I don't think there are any.
[162:09.28]The only birds that we have here in Vegas are scorpions.
[162:13.36]Okay, so connect.
[162:18.41]Can't believe I have to use the fucking treasure map to figure this out.
[162:24.86]Lay roof panel on flat surface... Match up the hill... Lay roof panel flat on surface...
[162:35.70]Place roof panel at 45 degree angle.
[162:39.54]Once you have lined up the nail holes, remove roof panel G and run a thin line of glue along the connecting edge.
[162:47.99]Connect one end of the chain to a hook.
[162:51.45]Run it through the bottom of the roof, across the top and back down again, attaching it to the other hook.
[163:07.68]Where's the chain?
[163:08.22]I know my mother took it from me because I was playing with it too much.
[163:11.68]Alright, so like this.
[163:12.80]Okay.
[163:23.09]Hold on, just like the crane game.
[163:24.07]I can get it.
[163:27.08]This is just one of those tense scenes in a movie where I have to be very quiet because, like, the weird pig guard over there, like, the guy with the pig face, he's snoring and he's fat and he's, like, he ate a bunch of sand shit before I came over and I'm trying to get the key from his fucking side of his pocket here.
[163:45.24]Oh, oh, you woke up!
[163:45.90]Oh, hold on a second, hold on.
[163:47.64]Okay, he's back asleep.
[163:49.16]I gotta get that key.
[164:14.19]Just fucking karate chop him in the back of the neck and then take the key.
[164:16.91]That's what I would do.
[164:25.12]I'm stuck.
[164:26.04]Alright.
[164:27.60]So I need to feed this through here like this.
[164:37.30]Wait, hold on.
[164:37.88]No, no, no, no, no.
[164:38.46]This has to go the other way.
[164:43.10]Put the hooks down.
[164:45.77]For a second.
[164:47.01]Jesus, Jason.
[164:48.86]Oh, real name!
[164:50.07]Fuck!
[165:41.58]Get in the fucking hole.
[165:45.26]It's really just too, it's too thin.
[165:49.30]It won't go through.
[165:51.50]Get in.
[165:52.52]Aye.
[166:07.21]I'm getting the paint!
[166:08.45]Oh, that's stupid!
[166:10.15]Fuck!
[166:10.89]No!
[166:11.31]I'm getting it everywhere!
[166:12.55]God damn it, you stupid face!
[166:17.15]It's glue!
[166:23.03]That's not gonna dry.
[166:24.31]I'm wiping it off.
[166:25.85]Oh, it's ruined!
[166:26.83]I've ruined it!
[166:27.67]Look at the side of the fucking hose!
[166:39.46]I want to show you that.
[166:40.21]I'm trying.
[166:40.93]Do you see what's happening here?
[166:43.89]This shit, it don't want to work.
[166:45.05]Like, it don't want to work.
[166:46.43]It doesn't want to... Okay.
[166:52.91]Got it.
[166:55.37]Now... What does this want me to do?
[167:12.49]You know what I mean?
[167:14.27]How does this want me to actually do this?
[167:15.61]Do I have to... I have to hang this.
[167:16.81]I have to drill those holes somewhere.
[167:23.70]What labo is this?
[167:24.72]This is pretty much a labo stream.
[167:34.08]So then it wants... because then you hang it like that.
[167:35.90]Okay.
[167:37.63]So this has to come out here.
[167:56.77]The hole is just not big enough for the chain to be in here.
[167:58.89]That's the problem with this device.
[168:04.75]Alright, we're almost through completely.
[168:10.07]So that's through like this.
[168:13.88]So, but am I supposed to have these connected?
[168:17.02]So it's like that.
[168:25.26]You feel like it's not that hard?
[168:48.27]Now these get connected, and then it hangs somewhere.
[168:54.49]Now the question is, how the fuck am I gonna connect these?
[168:56.35]Who needs it?
[169:03.66]Perfect.
[169:12.57]I need to test it though.
[169:24.32]Got it.
[169:25.02]Look at that.
[169:26.20]It's ready.
[169:27.34]Alright, now we need to like put stuff in it to pretend there's a bird in there.
[169:31.78]Here, I got an idea.
[169:37.40]Get away, get in there.
[169:42.13]See, it's like a little bird.
[169:46.43]Okay, I'm gonna make a family and see how they like it in there.
[169:56.26]Okay.
[169:59.62]There's one.
[170:00.14]Gotta get the baby bird.
[170:02.22]See?
[170:08.61]It's like a little baby bird, right?
[170:10.81]See?
[170:15.64]And we can make the papa bird.
[170:36.30]um whatever this is alright so now there's a family in there close this up let's take a look how does it how is it pretty good I think so this is sturdy
[171:06.07]If it was just hanging on the side there.
[171:07.57]See, that's what it's gonna look like when it's hanging.
[171:20.98]Don't smash it with the birds in there.
[171:23.94]I need to connect this though, because it seems, I can't really bend it.
[171:32.20]It looks like I can, but it's... I need, like, a wire.
[171:36.04]I need, like, a wire cutter or pliers or something.
[171:40.18]Well, whatever.
[171:41.00]Alright.
[171:41.34]Here's your birdhouse.
[171:43.14]No, it can't fit in there.
[172:01.20]I can't put any more birds in here.
[172:03.56]Now unpaint it.
[172:05.82]What do you mean I can't unpaint a birdhouse?
[172:11.53]Make the hole bigger with the hammer.
[172:13.33]No, this is perfect.
[172:20.39]Okay, it's good.
[172:25.63]Now burn it.
[172:29.36]Wait, how am I gonna get that out of there?
[172:37.68]Oh, that stuff is just in there.
[172:48.84]This is bad.
[172:49.48]I gotta get rid of that.
[173:21.14]The wood is split here.
[173:37.36]Why is that not doing anything?
[173:38.50]Come on, get in there.
[173:53.01]We're good.
[174:19.08]What is with the Scooby Doo nails?
[174:20.90]Like I smashed one and the other one opens up.
[174:24.86]Is this whack-a-mole?
[174:26.86]I got it stuck in here.
[174:42.80]Jesus, alright, we're good.
[174:50.38]Okay, it's all free in there, see?
[174:52.10]I need a little bit more of this to put this back on.
[175:01.35]This is like, hey, you Pikachu.
[175:03.99]What the hell are you talking about?
[175:12.61]I used all the glue to do this stupid face, didn't I?
[175:16.58]Nope, we're still good.
[175:18.84]Just need enough to put it on there and so it stays.
[175:24.59]Perfect.
[175:25.05]Alright, come on.
[175:25.77]Just a little bit more.
[175:28.03]That's like you never saw a fucking thing.
[175:31.46]Got it.
[175:33.48]Okay.
[175:33.62]Okay.
[175:52.28]Back to normal.
[175:52.94]There it is.
[175:55.72]Eat the glue.
[175:57.23]I'm not gonna eat the fucking glue.
[175:59.99]Glue your fingers together.
[176:02.73]That doesn't work, guys.
[176:03.67]This isn't a cartoon.
[176:12.38]There we go.
[176:18.10]There's the birdhouse.
[176:23.21]Chain has been the hardest part.
[176:25.13]That's what broke it the first time.
[176:27.07]Just do it very carefully.
[176:30.58]Glue your tongue to a lamp post.
[176:32.12]It doesn't work.
[176:32.64]I've tried it.
[176:42.43]Alright.
[176:43.55]There it is.
[176:44.15]There's your birdhouse.
[176:45.17]Done.
[176:47.49]I can't wait to f- This fucking chain is just whatever.
[176:51.84]It was, it looks fine.
[176:53.50]It looks alright, it looks cute.
[177:01.46]What do you mean pull?
[177:04.88]What am I doing a pull for?
[177:10.78]A pull for what, for this?
[177:15.78]The roof is backwards.
[177:16.90]No, that's Sonic the Hedgehog.
[177:19.14]That's what we decided on.
[177:24.79]Thousand volts?
[177:26.47]Where do you think I'm gonna get a thousand volts from?
[177:32.67]Look at the paint.
[177:34.49]What?
[177:36.12]I mean, there's some paint here, but that's okay.
[177:38.00]As long as I don't get it on my desk, or on my mouse, or on my face, or on my body, I'll be fine.
[177:45.88]Has Sonic Heroes been playing in the background this whole time?
[177:48.76]I hope it hasn't.
[177:50.70]Under the roof.
[178:02.46]I don't have any, I don't have any blue.
[178:04.10]There's no more blue left.
[178:12.80]It's gonna have to be red.
[178:14.96]I'm not gonna smash it.
[178:16.28]This has been almost three hours.
[178:18.03]This has been three hours to make this fucking thing perfect, okay?
[178:24.37]The roof is so bad.
[178:34.52]I'm not going to smash it.
[178:35.96]This is a piece of memorabilia.
[178:38.62]It's a memorabilia piece.
[178:41.64]That glue is actually pretty good.
[178:47.17]Fix it with the hammer.
[178:50.97]Get this away from me.
[178:52.09]Don't put it over there because there's paint on it.
[178:53.69]I have to look at it.
[178:55.75]What am I doing with the treasure?
[178:56.71]I've got clean up.
[179:00.41]Sell it?
[179:04.57]How much would you have?
[179:05.31]Okay, let's start it.
[179:06.05]Start the bidding.
[179:07.73]Start the bidding.
[179:08.83]Start the bidding at 30 cents.
[179:23.60]Well, that was fun.
[179:27.03]I pulled it off the auction.
[179:31.41]I'll give you six golden rings for it.
[179:35.36]God.
[179:37.78]I'll trade it for a better one I made myself.
[179:46.65]The back does look a little fucked up, but it doesn't matter.
[179:49.52]We tried our best with the resources that we had.
[179:53.04]Four dumb shitty cheap paints, a little stick of don't eat me glue, a treasure map, and badly cut wood.
[180:22.52]Nevermind.
[180:25.08]This took him four hours?
[180:26.27]Don't add time for no reason!
[180:27.93]It was three!
[180:29.21]This took him four hours.
[180:30.57]This took me three hours, okay?
[180:32.27]Not four.
[180:32.99]Don't add time to make it funnier.
[180:34.99]It was three.
[180:36.03]And by the way, an hour of that was us just chillin' out and talkin' and playin' an IRL stream.
[180:41.53]So it wasn't a complete and total build.
[180:43.59]I left, I washed my hands.
[180:46.48]It probably took like two and a half hours.
[180:50.73]and we were just hanging out.
[180:52.14]That's what we were doing today.
[180:55.00]I'm gonna smash it.
[180:56.62]Don't smash it.
[181:01.02]This didn't take nine hours.
[181:04.32]I look like kind of dirty today.
[181:07.24]Oh, it's because of this.
[181:07.94]That's right, I forgot.
[181:16.42]Facecam you putting it up.
[181:18.19]Where am I gonna, oh, I have to do a pushup, right.
[181:21.38]Here.
[181:22.86]I can't touch anything.
[181:23.90]Just let me be right back.
[181:25.42]Let's just like, we're going to chill and hang out for a little bit longer.
[181:29.95]I need to like clean the fuck up, but I can't do that yet.
[181:34.69]Hey, let me, I'm going to move this to somewhere safe.
[181:40.59]Just move the whole fucking thing.
[181:41.69]Hold on.
[181:48.26]That looks like a torture instrument.
[181:53.95]It's very clearly a birdhouse.
[181:58.20]Oh, hey, Birdot!
[181:59.98]We've got a bird coming in right now with five community subs!
[182:03.50]Thank you, Birdot.
[182:06.49]See?
[182:06.97]I told you birds love this thing.
[182:08.33]Alright, let me at least, like, hold on.
[182:12.49]Let me at least wash my hands and I'll come back and we'll just hang out for a second.
[182:14.79]Hold on.
[183:31.70]okay so whoa hold on that's hold on there okay oops naked see I had to wear clothes today that sucks
[183:58.88]Let me move this back to here.
[184:02.12]Actually, let me just go like this.
[184:07.96]Alright.
[184:09.56]So that was that.
[184:12.53]Thank you for joining me on that.
[184:15.29]Let me move... Do I have... I should be using the other camera, but it's all good.
[184:25.17]It's all good.
[184:27.28]So that was kind of the plan today.
[184:29.13]And I'm gonna give you a couple of things to look forward to.
[184:32.49]Uh... Oh, that's disgusting.
[184:34.89]That was not a booger on my hand, okay?
[184:37.61]So many people are gonna freeze frame this image.
[184:40.85]It was like this.
[184:42.97]And people are gonna be like, what the fuck is that on his thumb?
[184:45.28]There's like yellow-green boogers on his hands.
[184:47.42]It's paint.
[184:51.52]Oh, freeze it right there, dude.
[184:52.34]What does he have on his thumb?
[184:53.10]Is that like fucking snots?
[184:56.35]No, so I want to go over a couple of things while there's still a lot of people here.
[184:59.71]Thanks for coming out.
[185:00.33]That was just a stupid one guy said to do that.
[185:04.39]And that was that was the stream was the one guy said to build birdhouse.
[185:08.86]Proving yet again that you could be the one guy.
[185:11.80]But what I've been doing the last couple of days and today and I'm going to continue to do today and probably tomorrow and for the next few days, the Christmas Eve stream is is this two things that are going to happen here.
[185:25.27]Uh, I can't really talk about them yet.
[185:27.13]But, if I can get studio time on Christmas Eve, watch out for that fucking stream, because it's going to be insane.
[185:39.70]If I can do what I want to do on Christmas Eve, and I'm going to try, and that's why I took the last couple days off.
[185:44.67]Um, not green screen part two, something completely different.
[185:48.79]Uh, if I can get in there,
[185:52.26]We're going to have a lot of fun.
[185:54.14]So it's something I've been trying to plan and something I've been spending a lot of time recently trying to get it to work.
[186:01.01]And if it doesn't work, if I can't get into the studio on Christmas Eve, we're still going to do something.
[186:06.53]That's going to be very, very fun.
[186:08.73]I'll give you more details very soon.
[186:10.49]I've only got like another couple days to plan this, really, before knowing if it's gonna be possible in studio or out of studio.
[186:18.06]So... It's kind of what I've been doing over the last, uh... No, not iPad games.
[186:22.72]Something different.
[186:23.36]Something that you haven't seen before on the channel.
[186:25.19]Something different.
[186:26.75]Something a little different.
[186:28.61]But let me, uh, move with this.
[186:30.19]I need, like, the better camera.
[186:37.72]Because this game really sucks.
[186:44.33]But it does.
[186:44.99]I'll tell you what it does involve.
[186:46.17]No, I can't.
[186:46.59]I'm not going to do that.
[186:47.91]There's like five different segments that are going to be on that stream if it happens.
[186:51.27]And I'm going to put a ton of time into it.
[186:55.03]Where did I go?
[186:55.59]Hold on.
[187:00.18]Well, that's as good as I'm going to be able to get.
[187:01.76]Because I can't put the other camera in.
[187:05.14]It's an incoming joke.
[187:06.18]No, no incoming jokes.
[187:07.84]Well, actually, incoming joke potentially on the 24th.
[187:12.18]Because that's Christmas Eve.
[187:18.81]Al's shirt, yeah?
[187:20.97]No problem.
[187:21.37]This motherfucker used to eat cats.
[187:22.69]You know that, right?
[187:27.37]I thought he was a cat.
[187:31.25]He's a cat with...
[187:33.70]Look at this, like, pompadour haircut he has.
[187:38.08]You sure?
[187:38.48]Yeah, I know.
[187:39.40]We've talked about the hole in the shirt.
[187:41.85]I need to get off of... I need to get off of this.
[187:47.81]Because I'm on art right now, and I'm just kind of sitting here.
[187:50.11]So let's go back to just chatting for a little bit.
[187:52.81]So the plan over the next couple days, like, uh, what, no, no, title, just chatting.
[187:56.94]No, that, build birdhouse complete.
[188:00.12]Birdhouse.
[188:01.58]Done.
[188:02.86]And then in brackets.
[188:05.42]Pretty decent.
[188:08.44]Okay, and then this is just chatting.
[188:10.06]Because that's what we're actually doing now.
[188:15.68]Oh, I think I did push-ups.
[188:16.94]Fine, here you go.
[188:23.38]I can't.
[188:28.82]You can't even see this.
[188:34.05]Is this a TV?
[188:36.31]No, that's my chair.
[188:37.23]I thought that was like a giant fucking TV.
[188:38.83]Get out of the way.
[188:43.48]You can see here, OK.
[188:51.12]Come on, there you go.
[188:52.24]I don't care.
[188:52.74]Green?
[188:53.26]Where's green from?
[188:53.88]I thought there was a person behind me.
[189:06.20]What the fuck is wrong with me right now?
[189:08.39]What's wrong with me?
[189:09.35]I thought this was a person.
[189:14.15]Like standing behind me.
[189:18.53]I'm losing my fucking mind.
[189:22.13]I just caught it in the peripheral.
[189:23.22]I'm like, who the fuck is that guy?
[189:28.01]Too much paint.
[189:29.37]Yeah, dude, I'm like breathing these fucking fumes.
[189:33.62]But anywho, yeah, so let's go over a couple of things.
[189:37.52]One, Christmas stream incoming and it's gonna be fun.
[189:42.84]And whether it's in the studio or not in the studio, I got two different plans.
[189:47.12]Tomorrow, we're probably gonna play Hotline Miami 2 and I'm just gonna play it all day and all night.
[189:52.64]That's the plan tomorrow.
[189:56.30]And then, so Monday
[190:00.55]I'm probably going to take Monday and Tuesday off because I desperately want to try to get this stream to work for Christmas Eve.
[190:09.65]And it's going to take a lot of off stream work where I can't really be live.
[190:13.45]I have to be making phone calls and hiring people.
[190:18.29]And without giving anything away, I have to really, really give it an honest try because I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
[190:24.89]So that's the plan over the next couple of days.
[190:28.39]Tonight we had this, tomorrow we're doing Hotline Miami.
[190:31.58]I might try to beat all of Hotline Miami tomorrow.
[190:34.90]Try to give you guys like a good like eight to ten hour stream tomorrow.
[190:37.88]Just fucking beat the damn game.
[190:39.32]Just play it and fucking engross into it.
[190:43.72]Nervous streamer?
[190:47.40]No, I don't think so.
[190:49.51]When I talk about... I'll give you a little in-depth into my life here.
[190:54.53]When I'm just like being me...
[190:57.13]It's like hard to just be me.
[190:59.91]You know what I mean?
[191:00.37]With a camera on.
[191:02.19]Like if I'm doing like a character or like voices, look at how easy, I'm not nervous at all.
[191:07.08]But not like, hey, I'm just like talking to you guys with a camera on.
[191:09.80]It's like, wait, hold on.
[191:11.92]I gotta be me.
[191:12.58]Okay.
[191:15.98]So guys, hey, it's me and...
[191:24.87]Is there a god?
[191:25.63]I'm kidding.
[191:26.85]I'm not nervous.
[191:27.67]I don't know why I would be.
[191:28.79]Why would I be nervous right now?
[191:32.91]I don't have like a reason to be nervous.
[191:35.37]I just talk too fast.
[191:39.67]Stop shaking.
[191:41.93]Speaking of shaking, is there any coffee left in here or tea?
[191:49.48]Alright, I had a panic attack in my brain for a second.
[191:51.56]I thought there was paint in here.
[191:53.82]I thought, because remember I reached over to this and I was like, oh yeah, dip that in there.
[191:58.04]I thought, because it was like three hours ago now.
[192:00.68]I thought I did that.
[192:03.28]There's nothing even, look, it's like empty.
[192:07.28]You want me to drink that gross dirt at the bottom?
[192:12.63]He's flying off the handle.
[192:15.33]No, but that's the plan.
[192:17.37]I really hope I can get it to work.
[192:18.77]Because it'll be...
[192:21.48]If I can do what I want to do on Christmas Eve, it will be the most intricate stream that I've ever done.
[192:27.88]By far.
[192:28.99]By a fucking million times.
[192:30.87]So... It's gonna be... We'll try.
[192:34.55]I'll try.
[192:35.15]I'm gonna try as hard as I fucking can.
[192:37.01]But if I can't get it... Then we'll... I have plan B. And plan B is not as elaborate and intricate as the studio stream is.
[192:49.59]But it'll still be a lot of fun.
[192:54.57]This is not something that I've talked about before.
[192:56.18]This is just a Christmas themed stream.
[193:00.12]That's all you need to know.
[193:04.96]But let me, let me hammer out some of the details before I really like announce anything because it's very easy to be like, so this is what's happening on Christmas Eve and I hope you're there and it's going to be a lot of fun and this is exactly what's happening.
[193:14.47]And then some of it just doesn't happen.
[193:15.91]So I'd rather, why are you guys adding pushups?
[193:25.54]What's this command that we're adding?
[193:27.00]Pushups?
[193:30.38]Somebody adding plus one pushup?
[193:34.14]Why?
[193:34.36]I didn't do them all.
[193:40.45]Oh, it's being deleted.
[193:42.47]It's being deleted.
[193:43.65]Okay, I get it.
[193:46.75]Why would you be counting those in the first place?
[193:54.15]Christmas Eve present.
[193:56.29]Maybe.
[193:58.32]Maybe.
[194:00.08]Keep your ear to the ground over the next few days, guys.
[194:05.32]Hopefully I have something interesting to announce.
[194:06.74]But, speaking of that, it's still early enough where I can go work on it.
[194:12.35]So, I'm gonna get out of here now.
[194:15.23]Short three-hour stream.
[194:17.00]Sorry that this is where it's ending.
[194:19.72]But tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, Hotline Miami 2, we're just going to go as long as I can.
[194:29.43]So, tomorrow we're going to do Hotline Miami 2.
[194:32.09]It's going to be a fun game.
[194:33.33]Can't wait.
[194:35.03]You're so ominous.
[194:36.99]No, this is not something that's ominous.
[194:38.35]It's something that's very fun.
[194:43.28]See you tomorrow.
[194:45.06]Okay.
[195:01.73]Got ya!
[195:03.21]Alright, let's do the bits.
[195:07.74]And the subs.
[195:10.15]What time tomorrow?
[195:10.83]Probably around the same time as today.
[195:12.51]Probably around 3.30.
[195:14.38]No, no, no, not the same time as today.
[195:17.06]I had a phone call.
[195:19.56]I had a couple of phone calls, actually, that I had to make.
[195:23.24]So that's why I wasn't here at where I was supposed to be.
[195:25.57]But probably 3 o'clock tomorrow.
[195:27.77]3 PST.
[195:29.53]And we'll go probably all night.
[195:32.89]Should be a lot of fun.
[195:33.55]Hope to see you there.
[195:35.35]See you tomorrow, if you're leaving.
[195:36.83]Thanks for joining us for the, uh... The birdhouse stream, which... That's what it was.
[195:42.27]That's what we did.
[195:46.57]And thank you to Double D!
[195:48.05]Thank you to Double D for the $1.

[196:03.38]Thank you, Double D. Thank you, Hasnain, for the $1.
[196:07.40]If this stream isn't a 10 out of 10, I want my money back.

[196:31.11]This Jeremy guy's a real jokester.
[196:32.53]Will you marry me?
[196:33.45]I'm mailing you a ring so you can't refuse.
[196:40.21]I don't think that's how it works.
[196:42.57]But thank you E-Troop for the 10 bucks.
[196:45.14]Appreciate it.
[196:45.60]Thank you for the $10 and the ring that you're sending.
[196:49.96]I'm gonna have to send it back.

[196:59.08]Thank you.
[197:00.04]Thank you Divis for the $4, Divis.
[197:03.30]Hashtag charity.
[197:05.36]Awesome.
[197:05.64]Thank you, Divis.
[197:09.00]Uh, Varian, thanks for the $1.
[197:10.34]This is already my favorite stream.
[197:12.48]P.S.
[197:12.78]Your hair's looking really good today.
[197:14.08]Did you do something special with it?
[197:16.16]I use a couple of products.
[197:18.54]I don't... Here's tip number one.
[197:20.18]I don't put any product in my hair.
[197:23.20]Right?
[197:24.18]I use products in the shower.
[197:26.72]So I'm in the shower and I use good shampoos and conditioners and then I don't do anything else to it.
[197:32.47]And I let it do what it's going to do and I make sure it's nice and fluffy.
[197:37.13]I don't put hair gel, mousse.
[197:38.79]I don't do that at all.
[197:40.03]Never.
[197:51.65]Your hair is fluffy in the shower when you get out and you fluff it up.
[197:55.46]I fluff it up and then I leave it alone.
[197:59.98]Moose hair?
[198:01.28]What?
[198:05.06]How often do I comb?
[198:06.06]Only after the shower.
[198:07.71]So I get out of the shower, I brush my teeth.
[198:10.63]Sometimes I brush my teeth in the shower to save some time.
[198:14.07]Sometimes I piss in the shower to save some time.
[198:18.81]And then when I get out of the shower,
[198:22.62]I just go with a comb.
[198:24.44]Not a fine-tooth comb, because you don't want to rip out hairs.
[198:31.22]You go back with it, you know what I mean?
[198:33.62]You just kind of get it nice, so it's not all crazy, and flip it up a little bit, make it do fluff it up, and then leave it alone, and make sure it's been combed, and then I leave it alone.
[198:46.05]Why we all, yeah, you all, everybody pees in the shower.
[198:48.13]Don't, anybody, that's weird.
[198:50.51]Why do people say that?
[198:52.08]What the fuck?
[198:53.14]Ew, what's wrong with you?
[198:54.40]You did that today.
[198:56.29]I know you did.
[199:00.95]I know you did it today.
[199:06.71]Did I ever tell you guys this story?
[199:09.97]When I was in college and somebody was peeing in the shower.
[199:14.34]And everybody was upset about it.
[199:16.36]It's like, dude, somebody's like pissing in the shower.
[199:18.98]Somebody's peeing in the shower, dude.
[199:20.30]I don't know who is it.
[199:21.67]It was like 10 of us.
[199:23.61]Like almost 12 of us that lived in this place.
[199:27.05]And there was detective work, everybody was trying to find out who it was.
[199:31.75]And ha, here's the punchline.
[199:33.53]All of us was doing it.
[199:35.99]It was like pretend, we were pretending that we were upset about it for some reason because nobody wanted to get caught.
[199:42.87]It was at least like 4 or 5 of us that were doing it.
[199:50.80]And I remember sitting on the couch being like, who's fucking doing this, man?
[199:54.60]That's, like, really messed up.
[199:55.74]Like, stop doing that.
[199:56.70]Like, we go in there, and I was doing it.
[200:08.05]There are people who piss in the shower, and then there are liars.
[200:21.13]in other people's showers.
[200:22.41]Guys, I don't piss in the shower every fucking single time.
[200:26.47]Okay?
[200:28.47]Please be clear about this.
[200:35.88]If I come over to your house, I'm not gonna pee in your shower.
[200:44.24]No, I'm not.
[200:44.90]I wouldn't do that.
[200:49.64]I'm a liar.
[200:55.97]Don't invite him over your house, man.
[200:57.27]He's gonna pee in your house.
[201:00.55]Why are you showering at my house?
[201:02.55]Because you invited me over there and I like stay the night.
[201:07.69]What do you mean?
[201:08.19]Why am I... We're talking about if I was invited to sleep over and I stayed there and I agreed and we both were like, yeah, that would be fun.
[201:17.76]Do you shit in the shower too?
[201:19.22]No, it's a polar deal.
[201:20.24]You gotta open up the drain and it's like a pain in the ass.
[201:22.28]I haven't, I don't do it anymore.
[201:35.27]I'm sorry, anymore?
[201:37.91]No, never.
[201:39.61]I pee in the shower like three times a year.
[201:41.35]This is all, this is all just smoke and mirrors.
[201:48.67]Anyway, thank you to Sprite37 for the $1.
[201:50.79]I hope you're enjoying Las Vegas, and it's treating you better than it did me before I moved away several years ago.
[201:57.23]Uh, be safe, and I hope you have a chance to check out, uh, Excalibur's Tournament of Kings if you decide to visit the Strip.
[202:04.44]There's a lot of interesting stuff in the Strip.
[202:07.08]But, yeah, you do have to, you do have to, like, just be careful.
[202:11.58]You can get really sucked in to the Vegas culture.
[202:15.90]So, actually, uh,
[202:21.02]I wanted to go to the esports arena at some point here to check it out, because that's on the strip.
[202:30.02]I think we were talking about that a few weeks ago.
[202:41.17]In the Luxor, yeah.
[202:42.95]Did you move to Las Vegas?
[202:44.00]Yes, I did.
[202:45.28]Just about a few months ago now.
[202:47.80]Back in October.
[202:55.08]Well, I don't think you're ready to compete.
[202:58.92]No, to watch.
[203:01.75]And I'm going to go to EVO this year.
[203:03.61]Because that's right in Vegas.
[203:09.11]I've always wanted to go to EVO.
[203:11.07]Just because I feel like it's an interesting thing to watch.
[203:12.65]I want to go watch Mortal Kombat 11 at EVO.
[203:21.74]It'll be out by then.
[203:27.63]What the hell is Evo?
[203:29.31]Uh, Evo is the fighting game tournament.
[203:35.15]But yeah, I kind of said I wasn't going to do any more... any conventions for the next probably six to twelve months, just because... uh, moving was very expensive.
[203:45.58]And... spend... We spent... we've spent a lot of money so far just on getting this place livable.
[203:54.81]So I kind of like, yeah, you know, that expensive trip to TwitchCon or the expensive hotel rooms at PAX East going back.
[204:05.38]I just don't think I'd be able to do it.
[204:11.74]But 2019, somewhere in the halfway point in the summertime, I'll probably be making my way back to conventions and stuff.
[204:22.12]Anywho, thank you, Sprite.
[204:25.60]I've been enjoying Vegas so far.
[204:27.29]Thank you.
[204:29.39]Joey Fettuccine, thank you for the $27.50.
[204:31.69]No message.
[204:34.91]Thank you, Joey.
[204:37.91]Thanks for the $27.
[204:41.65]Appreciate it.
[204:44.61]And there's no message here.
[204:47.77]Put all your money on red.
[204:49.25]No.
[204:49.55]No.
[204:53.01]No.
[204:55.82]Thank you to, uh, Jinzibo for the $10 here.
[204:59.02]We had a big nearly $30 from Joey and then a big $10 here from Jinzibo.
[205:05.20]Jerma is like that weird uncle who keeps telling the same fucked up story every time you meet him and you're still not sure if it's real or not.
[205:11.73]So you sit there nervously contemplating whether you should laugh or not.
[205:16.39]I got you right where I want you.
[205:20.35]Because anything could be real.
[205:22.86]Anything could be real.
[205:26.57]You know what I mean?
[205:46.21]What does your reality look like, huh?
[205:50.91]Hmm?
[205:52.95]Tell me.
[205:58.31]What does your reality look like?
[205:59.46]Huh?
[206:05.78]What does your reality look like?
[206:07.20]You can't even see it.
[206:07.86]I gotta turn off these monitors.
[206:12.85]It's a glow-in-the-dark squishy ball.
[206:21.77]I don't know why this is in here.
[206:24.38]Hold on, can you see?
[206:24.98]I got a
[206:32.62]Let that sit there for a minute.
[206:37.18]I fucked it up.
[206:37.70]It doesn't matter.
[206:42.15]He could... Alright.
[206:43.97]Whoa.
[206:46.15]See?
[206:46.49]It looks like this.
[206:47.07]There we go.
[206:47.89]It's kind of glowing.
[206:48.81]I gotta get all these monitors turned off.
[206:59.10]Hold on.
[207:09.47]Alright, ready?
[207:11.67]No, don't drop it.
[207:22.50]What the fuck does your reality look like?
[207:55.65]Let me get a little bit more juice on it.
[207:59.46]Okay, that should be better.
[208:01.68]Nice.
[208:07.18]This thing is fucking powerful.
[208:11.60]What the fuck?
[208:15.38]Whoa!
[208:17.26]What the fuck?
[208:21.37]Turn the fucking lights back on, man.
[208:22.57]This is freaking me up.
[208:37.29]Okay, I can see you guys again.
[208:43.98]I've got a slimy face.
[208:49.14]Nice joke, you idiot.
[208:55.10]I don't have a slimy... It's a contrast.
[208:58.82]If you see me... Those of you who see me in real life, you know that I don't have a slimy face.
[209:10.26]Uh, thank you, Slimer.
[209:13.22]Oh, thank you, Slimes, for the $5.
[209:16.60]That's a really, uh, perfect name to read right this second.
[209:20.46]No message, thank you, Slime.
[209:23.28]Thank you, FreudianWeapon, for the $1.30.
[209:25.08]jermaHeart, thank you.
[209:27.10]SlothJones, thanks for the $1.00.
[209:28.70]Streamer builds house for himself.
[209:32.62]LOL.
[209:34.54]That's me laughing out loud.
[209:39.23]For those of you boomers in here.
[209:42.45]Hey, awesome!
[209:43.73]Awesome, Alec, thanks for the one dollar.
[209:45.09]If you were a bird, I think you could fit in that house.
[209:48.93]Back to back.
[209:52.21]Back to back.
[209:55.11]Hey, DubskiDude, thanks for the one dollar.
[209:56.64]The act of you turning on your webcam is the equivalent of taking a sledgehammer to my already fragile heterosexuality.
[210:08.53]Well, thank you, Dubsky.
[210:16.03]Thank you so much for the one dollar.
[210:20.42]Although, I don't know.
[210:20.90]I have, like, weird days.
[210:21.92]I have days where I look in the mirror and I go, ooh, nice.
[210:26.26]And then I have days where I look in the mirror and I go, ooh.
[210:30.80]I think we all have those days, though.
[210:33.86]But, thank you.
[210:36.96]Thank you.
[210:38.42]Thank you, SheXOXO, for the $1.
[210:40.84]Hey, Jerma, where did you get that Pac-Man mug?
[210:44.10]Looks really neat.
[210:46.26]I have secret locations, like Amazon.com.
[210:51.14]Now, you can get it... There's a lot of places you can get it.
[210:52.68]You can get it online.
[210:56.43]You can get it... There's a lot of, like, novelty gift stores you can get it at.
[210:59.73]If you have one of those weird novelty stores near you.
[211:07.52]Sponsored by Amazon.
[211:08.84]Uh, this whole website is sponsored by Amazon.
[211:12.16]What are you on about?
[211:14.04]The entire- this whole entire platform is now sponsored by Amazon.
[211:17.63]The whole thing.
[211:23.71]I didn't- that's not my decision.
[211:31.55]But thank you for the $1.
[211:33.83]Hey, Logan.
[211:34.55]Thanks, Logan, for the $1.
[211:35.41]Hey, Gerber, I've been a big fan.
[211:36.95]I've been a big fan since TF2 days, and this is the worst thing I've ever seen.
[211:41.00]Thanks.
[211:41.52]God bless.
[211:42.30]Hashtag charity.
[211:43.56]I told you guys.
[211:47.56]I've made sure your expectations were very low today.
[211:54.56]Thank you, Logan.
[211:55.20]Thank you, Novi, for the $1.
[211:56.44]This is more embarrassing than the Raptor.
[211:58.26]Hashtag charity.
[211:59.43]No, what?
[212:02.67]Me building a birdhouse on stream is more embarrassing than me putting on a dinosaur costume and making dinosaur noises.
[212:11.34]No fucking way.
[212:12.74]Absolutely, there's no way that I can agree with that.
[212:19.01]They're about equal.
[212:25.58]Thank you, thank you Hans Beatz for the two bucks.
[212:27.52]He's still going to do the music stream in FL Studio.
[212:31.48]Love the streams, thanks for the laughs.
[212:33.26]Yes.
[212:36.53]That's kind of in the back pocket right now.
[212:40.67]In fact, that will probably end up being the next large stream after the Christmas one.
[212:48.35]Because I have quite a few ideas.
[212:51.04]And now that I have access to that studio and I told you pretty much like once a month I want to get in that studio and do something.
[212:58.42]And we're talking about potentially hiring like a real band to like record and make terrible fucking music.
[213:08.72]I mean... There's... I have access to stuff now that I never had before.
[213:18.77]Hire like a- hire like an actual audio engineer to mix together songs.
[213:24.03]This- this goes way beyond me just fucking around an FL studio at this point.
[213:38.92]Make up the band name, make a whole album.
[213:42.25]God.
[213:42.77]We'll see, though.
[213:43.67]I'm into it.
[213:45.80]So.
[213:46.28]But that'll happen after the Christmas stream.
[213:47.84]Because if the Christmas stream does happen the way that I want, that will also be a fairly large stream.
[213:53.30]So.
[213:54.40]Gotta spread them out.
[213:55.72]Once a month or so.
[213:56.48]Once every, like, 40, 30 to 45 days.
[213:58.58]That's what I want.
[214:02.35]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1.
[214:03.31]Remember to pick up the nails you dropped.
[214:04.85]P.S.
[214:05.07]I'm really glad you're not a contractor.
[214:07.51]Hashtag charity.
[214:11.23]Yeah, I did kind of make a fool out of myself trying to hammer those in, didn't I?
[214:17.51]It's alright.
[214:19.03]Thank you, Butter Dirt, for the $1.
[214:20.25]If you really wanted to do this well, you'd use wood glue and clams.
[214:24.67]jermaMoon.
[214:27.34]It was whatever came in the kit.
[214:30.88]Oh, clamps, okay.
[214:34.26]Freudian Weapon, thanks for the $10, Freudian.
[214:37.00]Looks like you don't skip arm day.
[214:40.49]I never used to.
[214:42.35]And it just stuck with me.
[214:43.39]I did so many arm workouts, guys, that my arms still look fucking sick.
[214:47.78]I don't even do it anymore.
[214:51.74]But thank you for the $10 Freudian weapon.
[214:57.38]Appreciate it.
[214:57.82]Thank you so much.
[214:59.87]Uh, really, probably really hot.
[215:00.57]I mean, they both have awful consequences.
[215:01.64]Really cold, you freeze to death.
[215:02.58]Really hot, you dehydrate to death.
[215:03.50]Which one of those things would you rather do?
[215:04.68]Probably hot.
[215:28.19]Because I feel like I could, like, search while it was hot.
[215:32.31]You can't really search when it's cold for stuff.
[215:34.69]Because your body locks up.
[215:44.57]In heat, you die slower.
[215:45.67]Yeah, but that gives me more time to search.
[215:48.23]For, like, I don't know, I'm stranded on a desert island.
[215:50.71]Where are, like, the fucking bananas and coconuts and strawberries and carrots and shit?
[215:54.90]They might be on that island.
[215:56.06]That gives me more time to find them.
[216:03.56]I don't know why I just read that.
[216:05.32]Thank you for the $1.
[216:06.44]Are you sure that by encouraging smaller birds to stay in one place, you aren't just building a bird feeder for a larger audience?
[216:34.76]We're making just, like, a live feeding den for vultures.
[216:43.74]Thanks for the advice.
[216:46.76]Thank you to Parfallumule for the one dollar.
[216:49.24]It's a YouTube link, I'm not gonna make the mistake by clicking it again.
[216:55.10]Uh...
[217:00.44]It's a guy, like, putting a bird in his mouth.
[217:02.69]I want to fucking... Thank you for the $1.
[217:08.89]Extra cheesy.
[217:10.94]Thank you.
[217:11.34]Why is GameCube's intro playing?
[217:13.74]What the fuck?
[217:14.76]Okay, there we go.
[217:18.84]One dollar.
[217:19.92]Extra cheesy.
[217:20.56]The judgmental man was some old crotchy guy who wouldn't understand the antics of a spry young streamer such as yourself.
[217:27.60]So don't worry, you're still cool.
[217:28.74]Also, I'm the place you're stranded on.
[217:31.44]Would you rather eat a Razer DeathAdder or a Logitech mouse?
[217:35.16]Well, a Razer DeathAdder would mean I would have to have it with me, and I would not want that with me.
[217:40.50]So, I'd probably want to take the Logitech mouse.
[217:49.67]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber, again, for the $1.
[217:51.89]Hey, Jeremy, back again.
[217:53.29]Wanted to clarify something about my bits from earlier this week.
[217:55.46]What I meant was, you are a very attractive man, regardless of your age.
[217:59.34]Not in spite of it.
[218:00.82]I'm crushing pretty hard, to be honest.
[218:06.90]Well, thank you!
[218:09.10]No, that's very kind of you.
[218:10.44]That's a very nice of you.
[218:12.42]I'm... I... I'm... Thanks, I don't...
[218:19.13]I don't know, like, how to... I don't even know how to react when people give me compliments like this.
[218:26.06]Because... I don't know.
[218:28.18]I, like, sit on the couch, and, like, shit my pants and stuff, and, like, don't get up, and, like, then I... I get, like, fed.
[218:39.57]None of that's true.
[218:40.85]None of that's true.
[218:41.41]I'm just...
[218:49.68]I don't know where I get fed comes from.
[218:51.88]I'm serious.
[218:53.54]I get fed.
[218:54.58]It's because we're talking about the vultures and that just jumped into my brain.
[219:09.67]I don't know what I was going with that.
[219:11.67]See I told you I don't know how to act when somebody says things like this.
[219:14.53]Thank you Demonic Cucumber.
[219:16.99]Again, for another dollar here.
[219:19.11]Also, my mom wanted to threaten chat for implying that she was old.
[219:24.15]But I can't post what she said because I'd get banned.
[219:26.85]Just be warned, chat.
[219:27.89]She's a scary lady.
[219:34.98]Yeah.
[219:36.94]Don't talk about somebody's mother like that.
[219:39.90]She's not old.
[219:46.76]Kim and Etalyx must have their hands full with you.
[219:50.46]No, I'm very good.
[219:54.48]I'm very good.
[219:55.82]Don't worry.
[220:00.16]Just put a face cloth on while you talk.
[220:02.18]Why would I put a fa- What?
[220:03.30]A face cloth?
[220:06.26]Dr. Clay, thanks for the one dollar fun fact.
[220:07.96]This is the fourth stream in a row where you've made the Hey Peter joke.
[220:12.26]No, I did not.
[220:12.98]When did I say Hey Peter this whole entire stream?
[220:16.64]I did not go, hey, Peter.
[220:17.90]No, I didn't.
[220:20.48]When?
[220:26.07]I did.
[220:26.75]An hour ago.
[220:27.47]No, I didn't.
[220:33.25]You actually did.
[220:34.15]You literally did.
[220:36.31]I need to have this proved to me, because I definitely do not remember doing, hey, Peter.
[220:44.20]There's no way.
[220:50.43]Dive to go vaude-diving.
[220:54.77]Somebody can get that to me, because I, like, okay, we're talking, because there's two different ways to say Peter.
[221:00.51]There's, hey, I'm Joe Swanson from Family Guy, and, uh, Peter.
[221:04.95]Let me tell you something now, Peter.
[221:06.77]Peter.
[221:07.87]Right?
[221:08.79]Then there's, uh, don't tell Harry, Peter.
[221:11.91]That's not the same thing.
[221:17.84]You definitely said Peter.
[221:22.03]I did not find it.
[221:24.38]You combined them.
[221:25.74]I definitely didn't.
[221:27.80]Yeah, I'll be proven wrong if I need to be.
[221:30.18]But that's a pretty good fun fact, Dr. Clay.
[221:31.98]Thank you.
[221:33.36]Apparently it was about three hours ago, because that's when this bit messaged.
[221:37.78]That's when Dr. Clay wrote this.
[221:41.34]Hawkeye of mine.
[221:42.02]Thanks for the $15, Hawkeye of mine.
[221:44.68]Alright, somebody has it.
[221:48.29]All of the towers have been unlocked.
[221:50.05]This is not even the right stream.
[221:51.01]This is the end game.
[221:53.97]Peter.
[221:54.73]Peter.
[221:55.59]We're at the end game now, Peter.
[221:58.37]That was like a week ago.
[222:06.67]I can't help it.
[222:07.59]I can't help it.
[222:08.23]I just can't.
[222:08.69]I'm sorry.
[222:09.87]Hawkeye of mine.
[222:10.43]Thanks for 15 bucks, Hawkeye of mine.
[222:11.95]Make me a hawk house.
[222:14.55]jermaVenus.
[222:17.42]Well, just, you can come get the birds that are in the house.
[222:19.76]Because you're a hawk.
[222:21.12]No, no birds are gonna- I'm gonna make sure the birds are safe.
[222:24.07]Okay?
[222:29.63]Darkstar700000games, thanks for the $1.
[222:31.93]Is your shirt collar trying to become a choker?
[222:34.67]Yes.
[222:35.41]It is.
[222:36.37]DoubleD, thanks for the $1.
[222:37.15]Hey Jerma, what keyboard do you use?
[222:38.59]It looks very nice.
[222:40.31]This is a... Uh, I believe this is a Walmart Logitech $15 keyboard.
[222:48.36]That's actually what this is.
[222:59.88]And guess what?
[223:02.38]Works just fucking fine.
[223:07.65]Works just fine for me.
[223:13.53]Yeah, it's the one in the green box.
[223:16.38]You'll know what I'm talking about.
[223:17.54]Next time you go to Walmart, look for the one in the green box.
[223:20.18]It's this one.
[223:20.64]It comes with a mouse, too.
[223:22.72]And it's wireless.
[223:31.39]Is it the K12?
[223:32.77]No, hold on.
[223:33.29]Let me see.
[223:35.21]This is the... This is the K540.
[223:39.70]Oops.
[223:40.12]Oops.
[223:47.80]Let's see.
[223:48.22]K540.
[223:53.18]Logitech.
[223:58.20]Where can I... Okay, there it is.
[223:59.42]No, no, no, no, no.
[224:03.58]You gotta go to, like, Walmart.
[224:04.74]Like, K... Like, Walmart.
[224:06.22]Okay.
[224:17.32]Okay, it's actually like 30 bucks.
[224:20.64]Yeah, I think it's like 35 dollars.
[224:23.98]Maybe not, I don't even know.
[224:34.71]It's in like the realm of like 40 something dollars.
[224:53.68]I'm just closing windows Alright, so Yeah, it's a Logitech 540 whatever it was it's like 40 bucks comes the most all you need man unless you like you do do you really want to have like I Don't like mechanical keyboards cuz it sounds like it's raining in my house.
[225:14.41]I don't want that I've had them before and it's just no I
[225:29.59]It's mostly streaming.
[225:31.11]I got my mic right here, like... Okay, let me go this way.
[225:35.49]Okay, yeah, he's over here.
[225:39.67]Yeah, let me get him.
[225:41.93]Okay, I just missed that shot.
[225:50.18]Fake E3 voice.
[225:56.23]Don't get a blue switch.
[225:57.39]Yeah, I know, there's like the cherry red and the, the, with the O-rings.
[226:01.73]I know, I've had them before.
[226:04.27]But I've dumped sodas and, and like, beers in them.
[226:06.69]And like, they're too much money.
[226:08.45]And I've come to the conclusion that I cannot be trusted with anything.
[226:11.51]So, a $40 keyboard and mouse from Walmart.
[226:16.01]Like, if I dump a fucking beer in here, like, it's not gonna be a huge problem.
[226:21.09]If I dump a beer in a $180, $150 piece of machinery, I'm gonna be upset about it.
[226:38.86]I've had really nice keyboards before, but... I don't know, I really am turned into like an old fucking van.
[226:45.06]I want to go back.
[226:45.62]I like the old keyboards.
[226:47.46]The ones that just... That's all you need.
[226:49.48]They don't need anything fancy.
[226:50.74]It just needs to have the letters on it.
[226:52.38]And you press the letters and then... That's all I need.
[226:57.97]What's wrong with that?
[226:58.93]There's nothing wrong with that at all.
[227:07.76]Boomer.
[227:08.22]Call me what you want.

[229:40.72]HawkeyeBind, thanks for $4.
[229:42.30]GamerBirdHouse, alright.
[229:44.92]Hashtag charity, thank you.
[229:47.65]GamingHash, thanks for the $1.82.
[229:49.11]You should play House Slipper again.
[229:50.25]They're coming out with a new gardening DLC.
[229:52.59]And they redid the graphics.
[229:57.42]Um, maybe.
[229:59.04]Maybe.
[230:00.27]We have gone back to that game a few times.
[230:03.59]And, I don't know, I feel like trying to squeeze out the last remaining bits from that game.
[230:09.41]If there's enough there, if there's actual a lot of content for the gardening, then maybe I'll go back to it and do it again.
[230:17.70]Birdhouse Flipper DLC.
[230:22.20]But thank you for the suggestion.
[230:23.46]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[230:24.44]Oh my god, the red light exposed Jerma's true identity.
[230:28.99]Sluggo, the melted action figure.
[230:35.01]Thank you, SandDraker, for the $1.
[230:39.36]Long time watcher, first time caller.
[230:40.82]Have you thought about getting a PO box that people can send stuff to?
[230:44.02]I imagine there's a lot of traditional fan art that people would love to send and share.
[230:46.84]If not, it'd probably be motivating a lot of people to make some.
[230:50.38]There's a few streamers I watch that open their public PO boxes every week, and it's really entertaining.
[230:56.00]Love you, and give Otto a pet from me next time you see him.
[230:59.70]I have talked about this a couple times before, and unfortunately I have to say no.
[231:05.51]P.O.
[231:05.77]boxes, because number one, they have to be maintained.
[231:09.31]I can't, I'm so scatterbrained.
[231:12.23]You guys all know that.
[231:13.19]That P.O.
[231:13.67]box would fill up.
[231:15.48]And I would get calls from the post office.
[231:17.80]Like, can you fucking come down here?
[231:19.96]And pick this shit up?
[231:22.46]Um, whoa, shit.
[231:23.74]Right, okay, okay, okay.
[231:27.62]And then also, there's like the chances that people send really fucked up stuff and
[231:34.69]I've thought about it in the past before.
[231:44.28]People send terrible shit to... Yeah, I just...
[231:48.75]I mean, for some streamers in some communities, like, yeah, it's, like, a fun thing you do, and I get it.
[231:54.06]I think that's, like, a funny, interesting thing to do.
[231:56.82]But I am not, like, ready nor prepared to, like, open up a box and have there be, like, throw-up in it.
[232:04.66]Because I'll just be like, and I'll, like, have to leave the room and, like, end the stream.
[232:16.39]But...
[232:17.65]Yeah, maybe like one day.
[232:21.43]But no, I don't even want to like pretend like that would be a reality.
[232:25.29]Probably not.
[232:28.38]Your viewer base is very wholesome.
[232:29.76]I can't imagine that happening.
[232:31.70]I know, but just don't want to have the opportunity for it to be a thing that could happen.
[232:41.59]Hold on to it, though.
[232:42.39]In the future, maybe I'll lighten up a little bit about it.
[232:45.66]But not now, not in the immediate future at all.
[232:49.88]But thank you.
[232:51.16]For the $1 sandraker.
[232:57.51]Appreciate it.
[233:01.31]It'd be like five people that actually send, like, blood and ruin it for everybody else.
[233:12.71]Yeah, I made like a whole video about getting like blood in the mail.
[233:15.56]Are you trying to tell me that you don't think that five of those packages the first day would not be like red liquid in a box?
[233:23.80]Come on now.
[233:34.69]But thank you.
[233:35.15]It's time for slime for the two bucks.
[233:37.56]Congrats on becoming the number one art streamer on Twitch.
[233:42.20]And I was building a birdhouse.
[233:56.67]Was I actually number one there?
[233:57.87]I think there are people that are spending lots of time and energy and effort on their pieces and artworks and stuff.
[234:06.27]And then look at me!
[234:07.01]Look at me!
[234:08.05]It's a hammer!
[234:12.59]But thanks for that.
[234:13.25]That was... Thank you.
[234:20.22]So a birdhouse is your side business?
[234:21.76]Or... Yeah, man.
[234:23.08]Sell them for 20 bucks a piece.
[234:27.52]But thank you.
[234:27.91]It's time for slime for the two bucks.
[234:30.53]Thank you, Suedo Lane, for the one dollar.
[234:32.63]Please pee on the birdhouse.
[234:35.15]Moon2Dev.
[234:36.47]Hashtag charity.
[234:39.14]What?
[234:41.79]Please pee on the moon house.
[234:45.17]On the fucking bird house.
[234:46.89]God damn it.
[234:55.68]Oh, that's what that is.
[234:56.48]Okay.
[235:02.95]Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[235:04.29]So where do you fit the Joy-Cons on this one?
[235:11.10]Ayayay.
[235:12.30]Thank you, Swerdy Swanky, for the one dollar.
[235:14.62]Story time.
[235:15.18]When I was seven, I wanted my dad to make a birdhouse with me.
[235:17.84]It was a special time because he was never home being a truck driver.
[235:22.07]However, shortly after the birdhouse was finished, a starling did try to go inside it, but the hole was made too small and the bird's head got stuck and couldn't get out.
[235:34.93]It was only until a week later that my dad had to throw away the birdhouse and
[235:40.10]with the body still attached and vowed never to make anything with me again.
[235:44.30]Oh my God.
[235:48.93]That's fucking horrible.
[235:54.79]Oh no.
[236:02.88]No, that's so sad.
[236:04.02]Yeah, how do I like unread that story?
[236:14.90]Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[236:16.58]That's not, that's, that's terrible.
[236:21.85]But, but, Peter!
[236:22.63]Here's a Peter.
[236:23.47]Hold on.
[236:24.37]But does that actually count, though?
[236:45.68]That doesn't count because I'm not doing... That doesn't count.
[236:58.29]That's clearly not a B. That's a P. That's a fucking B, whatever.
[237:10.78]But I'm not doing Joe from Family Guy.
[237:12.94]I'm doing Willem Dafoe from Spider-Man.
[237:17.66]Those are two different Peters.
[237:20.49]That's a half.
[237:25.89]That's a half.
[237:26.75]That's a half Peter.
[237:32.21]What the fuck?
[237:32.65]I'm like looking at this image right now.
[237:35.64]That had to have been the thumbnail for the stream at some point, right?
[237:41.43]I think I'm making a fucking little lunchbox.
[237:48.23]Just a hammer and a shitty little lunchbox next to me.
[237:53.53]And then my Magic Wizard Wars mousepad.
[237:59.94]I've had this mousepad for four years.
[238:02.28]I don't think the servers are even still turned on on this game.
[238:15.20]But anyways, thank you, Swiggity Swanky.
[238:18.47]Sorry to hear about that horrible story.
[238:20.43]That horrible, traumatizing, awful story.
[238:29.11]Thank you, Smelly Boy for the $1.
[238:30.43]How would you feel if you walked outside one day to check on the birdhouse and a full seagull was stuffed inside it like a Looney Tunes character with its beak poking out the front?
[238:39.94]No, not right after that last story.
[238:42.50]No.
[238:48.62]You mean, what you mean to say, you mean the bird is in the house, arms, like the wings are sticking out the side, beak out the front, feet out the bottom, and he's pretending like he can't see me.
[239:00.72]And he doesn't think I can see him.
[239:03.14]That's the trope you're talking about?
[239:08.94]I would, first of all, I'd laugh.
[239:11.46]And then I would be like, I would try to help the bird by taking the top off.
[239:16.98]I would, I would take the top off.
[239:20.08]And then the bird would... and get out.
[239:32.64]But this is the Looney Tunes universe, so it would be alright.
[239:39.42]But thank you for the $1.
[239:40.38]Thank you, Zazasalt, for the $1.
[239:42.12]Finches and chickadees are both native to Las Vegas.
[239:44.88]You could actually put it out somewhere and make a home for birds.
[239:49.40]You... Ornthologist... What the fuck is orn... What, orthodontist?
[239:55.87]You orthodontist fuck.
[239:57.39]Hashtag charity.
[239:59.49]Orn... Ornithologist.
[240:06.27]Ornithologist.
[240:07.61]Orthodontist.
[240:10.54]Ornithontidist.

[240:15.30]Okay.
[240:20.84]Thank you to... Birdot for the... Two, three, four... Five dollars here.
[240:30.45]They say, am I winning?
[240:33.49]Should I PM you my address to collect my prize?
[240:39.04]What?
[240:42.75]What prize?
[240:45.03]Oh, the bird.
[240:46.39]Bird.
[240:46.81]That's right.
[240:47.65]Okay.
[240:48.61]Birdot.
[240:51.22]Talking about the birdhouse.
[240:53.36]He was auctioning.
[240:54.12]I mean, yeah.
[240:55.86]It's for you.
[240:57.34]Just fly on over to Vegas.
[241:00.34]I'll know it's you.
[241:02.02]Just wear like a Jerma985 wristband or something so I know it's you.
[241:07.91]Just don't get stuck in it.
[241:11.59]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[241:13.11]We need those push-ups.
[241:14.16]I already did them.
[241:17.64]Scoot Shaco, thanks for the $5.
[241:19.90]Dude, your nuts were hanging out.
[241:24.51]Charity.
[241:24.99]Hashtag charity.
[241:28.93]No, that's not even possible with these pants.
[241:30.47]Sorry.
[241:31.33]They're completely sealed.
[241:34.43]Thank you for the $5, though, Scoot Shaco.
[241:38.39]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1 tweet.
[241:40.37]Tweet, come here, Woodstock.
[241:41.44]How do you do, Jerma?
[241:42.34]You got... Jerma, you got me while I was inviting everyone's favorite avian over to your birdhouse.
[241:48.86]Remember when Woodstock had that terminal illness and you cured him with your Fozzie Bear impression live on stream?
[241:55.48]That was really something.
[241:56.74]Woodstock's real thankful to his savior and wants to give you some popular Toon publicity.
[242:01.63]He's buying the birdhouse for 100 bits.
[242:04.53]What a historic event in streamer-Toon relations.
[242:07.76]Say cheese.
[242:15.39]That was something.
[242:17.75]What did I do?
[242:18.79]I can hear it's pain.
[242:21.05]I'm not in pain.
[242:27.15]He said his pants are sealed.
[242:28.49]It means that there's no way for... There's no way for my beaters to do anything like that.
[242:37.99]It's sealed.
[242:47.09]Thank you Garfield the Monday Killer again two more times for a dollar each.
[242:49.86]So three bucks here total.
[242:50.90]Thanks Garfield.
[242:52.34]I can't say I care much for Alf.
[242:54.82]He's threatened my life on multiple occasions.
[242:58.85]Now, if I get to send the ALF-threatening-my-life bits, you get an extra Garf buck.
[243:04.90]Hey, thanks, Garfield.
[243:22.58]This guy, okay, ALF is just the Sans and Barney rebel voice.
[243:28.24]That'd be a pretty good Sans voice actor.
[243:31.52]What the fuck does that mean?
[243:34.00]Okay, moving on.
[243:55.97]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim, for the one dollar.
[244:01.28]Don't eat Etalyx' brownies.
[244:05.22]Oh, I've seen this.
[244:07.06]Why would he do that to me?
[244:23.50]That's disgusting.
[244:24.18]Why would he ever do that?
[244:25.20]Why would he do that to me?
[244:26.18]Why is he doing that to me?
[244:27.10]Did the brownies he made like fucking three days ago do that?
[244:30.01]Did he do that?
[244:30.47]Did he shit in brownies for me?
[244:32.81]He was so adamant that I eat them.
[244:39.61]Hey, it's Russ Gower.
[244:40.67]Thanks for the $1.
[244:41.39]Hey, Jay.
[244:42.64]You've done an emote contest in a movie night, and he plans for an art showcase.
[244:46.88]I've been working on some drawings of Jerma characters, and I got wondering about it.
[244:49.66]By the way, you pronounced my name wrong again.
[244:52.07]No worries, though.
[244:53.17]I get that you can't read.
[244:55.59]Love you, hashtag charity.
[245:08.55]I think for some reason my brain is saying that your name is like Russell Gaara.
[245:17.10]That's your name.
[245:18.48]That's your first and last name.
[245:19.90]Russell Gaara.
[245:22.50]Like hey, it's Russ.
[245:23.26]It's like Russ Gaara.
[245:27.78]But that's not it.
[245:35.40]It's not like Russ.
[245:38.09]Is it, like, Etrus?
[245:42.54]Etrusgara?
[245:43.74]Etrusgara?
[245:46.36]Correct me, I need to know.
[245:50.32]Like, Etrus.
[245:54.61]Etrusgara.
[245:56.33]So it's not Russellgara.
[245:57.67]Well, thanks a lot, Russ.
[246:02.87]I appreciate it.
[246:03.73]No, thank you.
[246:06.05]I don't want to say these things.
[246:07.13]I don't want to say these things to people I don't know.
[246:08.55]I'm not gonna tell somebody to eat my ass and I'm not gonna... What?
[246:36.76]Thank you, Agent Pigeon, for the one dollar.
[246:39.80]Hey, Clueless Sniper.
[246:41.90]Thanks for the one dollar.
[246:42.76]Hello, Jerma?
[246:44.34]Smaller than average beer here.
[246:46.30]I just got evicted from the dumpster I was living in, and now I'm looking for a place to crash.
[246:50.53]What's the rent for the birdhouse?
[246:51.69]I've got a half-eaten cheeseburger and a very shiny penny.
[246:56.17]Oh, the birdhouse is for birds.
[246:57.49]It's not for people.
[247:02.29]Dude in the beer voice.
[247:05.62]Smaller than average beer.
[247:09.24]Streamer wants his viewers to eat his ass.
[247:12.16]No, I was correcting myself to make sure you didn't think that that's what I was trying to say.
[247:16.55]And that's not even what he was saying.
[247:18.69]He was telling someone by direct first name to eat their ass.
[247:25.13]And I'm not going to participate.
[247:30.25]Can't even do the voice anymore.
[247:32.59]Smaller than average beer.
[247:33.54]Smaller than average beer here.
[247:35.97]You know, I just got evicted from the dumpster.
[247:38.85]Now I'm looking for a place to crash.
[247:41.73]What's the rent on that birdhouse?
[247:44.52]I got a cheeseburger, half-eaten, don't worry about it, and a shiny penny.
[247:49.82]That gonna be enough for me to live there?
[247:54.49]Don't think I still fucking got it.
[247:55.67]Come on, man.
[248:05.56]Arthur from Red Dead.
[248:06.82]I just got a victim from that dumpster.
[248:24.66]It actually is.
[248:25.90]Damn.
[248:28.60]No, no, I didn't have none of that here.
[248:32.15]Dutch, I just, I need, I gotta get out of here, Dutch.
[248:37.19]Alright, fine, I guess I'll do whatever, whatever you say.
[248:41.13]Hey, mister.
[248:41.67]That's Pierre, Arthur.
[248:58.50]Arthur.
[249:01.80]What a fun- what a good voice acted video game.
[249:04.52]Alright.
[249:05.50]I got a plan!
[249:11.87]I was gonna just scream and do the Dutch scream, but not right now after doing that.
[249:15.39]Well that was a fucking revolting thing that I just read.
[249:18.87]In a just stone cold voice.
[249:19.75]Uh, thank you Toon!
[249:34.68]That's 94!
[249:35.68]Shit!
[249:36.64]I read it.
[249:37.68]But thanks for the 94 bits.
[249:42.00]Thank you.
[249:43.48]Thank you Graveyard Ghoul for the five dollars.
[249:45.52]How many streams till we get the roast of Jerma985?
[249:49.05]There's too much material there.
[249:51.69]You ever watch a roast, and they're just like trying to reach for like weird shit to say about somebody?
[249:57.77]Or, you know, let me come up with something.
[249:59.73]Oh man, let me tell you this one story, and the story's just like, who cares?
[250:03.06]That's not even a big deal.
[250:07.12]Let me tell you something about X. They prefer... I'm not even kidding.
[250:13.37]Listen to me.
[250:14.61]They one time... I was sitting on the couch with them, right?
[250:17.07]So we're sitting on the couch.
[250:17.75]We're gaming.
[250:18.33]We're playing Fortnite.
[250:20.31]Just like we always do.
[250:22.11]And my goodness, if... He doesn't pick up a controller and plug it in.
[250:28.26]And it was... He wasn't even kidding.
[250:30.20]And he only eats red and pink Starbursts?
[250:34.46]Why does he only eat red Starbursts?
[251:04.64]This guy's fucked.
[251:07.85]But for somebody, like, there's so much fucked up material.
[251:11.91]That would be actually embarrassing for me.
[251:15.27]It happened, like, two nights ago.
[251:17.14]When we were playing EDF, they were talking about, like, how I'm naked and shit and how, like, I'm an idiot and, like, it's embarrassing when I'm, like, naked.
[251:25.00]That, like, if that was on a roast, that would be real and it would be actually embarrassing for me.
[251:42.38]You never responded about the art showcase.
[251:44.45]Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[251:47.29]Uh, yes.
[251:48.53]Yes, yes, yes.
[251:50.65]I think something like that would be very fun.
[251:52.71]I know that there's a few streamers that I know of, and particularly that do art showcases, and it seems really, really cool, really fun.
[252:03.34]Really great way to show off stuff from the community.
[252:05.82]And I'm all about that.
[252:08.15]Just not immediately.
[252:09.99]Once we get to the new year, I'm going to sort out a few things to try.
[252:14.10]2019, I'm going to come up with a couple of things to do for either the end of streams or once a week or once a month that we just kind of hang out and do.
[252:28.66]Yeah, Vinny does it, yeah.
[252:29.52]I think there's a few other people I know that actually do art streams.
[252:36.58]But
[252:38.22]Yeah, Vinny's been doing it, and it's really, really cool.
[252:43.49]But that's not something I would do on, like, a day-to-day or a week-to-week basis.
[252:48.33]That would be something I'd want to do once in, you know, I feel like once, like I said, every month or two.
[253:00.07]Is there going to be a Death of the Memes on New Year's Eve?
[253:04.46]Not this year.
[253:05.02]They get to live.
[253:08.33]You saw what happened when I killed the memes.
[253:10.35]They just came back stronger, Obi-Wan style.
[253:20.25]But.
[253:21.29]Thank you to Why Am I Small?
[253:24.94]No, that's Will.
[253:25.98]That's Will I Am Small for the $1.
[253:29.72]When I visit Vegas, I can invite you to my hotel room and you can piss in my shower.
[253:36.14]I will probably respectfully decline
[253:45.24]Thank you, Will I Am Small, for the $1 and the invitation.
[253:54.32]Hey, Siruk!
[253:55.42]Siruk, thanks for the $1.
[253:56.76]Hello, Jerry.
[253:57.30]I have one question that will only take a minute to answer, but you can spend as long as you need elaborating on the answer if you feel the need to.
[254:03.10]How have you avoided capture for your crime of yadadadada last year?
[254:12.88]Because I didn't do anything.
[254:16.38]I didn't do anything.
[254:17.90]I didn't do anything.
[254:22.94]That's how.
[254:24.12]Because I didn't do anything.
[254:40.11]Vegas is a cover-up.
[254:44.57]Thank you for the one dollar, but I didn't do anything.
[254:49.61]Where are the Pikachu socks?
[254:52.58]I didn't do anything, okay?
[254:57.38]Uh, the Pikachu socks and the whale... They will be here soon.
[255:03.09]Don't worry, I will make sure to show the second those come in, the day those come in, you're going to see them the day they come in.
[255:14.45]Uh, Will I Am Small thanks for the $1 10 out of 10 ball tricks.
[255:17.69]Thanks man.
[255:19.91]Hey Serrano, thanks for the 50 cents and I read it.
[255:24.08]I don't know why I'm, I'm, I'm breaking my own rules.
[255:30.28]But it's a hashtag charity and you know it's worth reading because it was for charity.
[255:34.74]Thank you Serrano.
[255:39.82]Thank you Will I Am Small again.
[255:44.32]For $3?
[255:46.54]Ever since I watched Jerm's tutorial for the Tomislav, I've been a big fan.
[255:50.36]Gotta go now, but enjoyed the stream.
[255:52.20]That was a long time ago.
[255:55.02]Holy shit.
[256:03.52]The Tomislav tutorial.
[256:07.84]Wow.
[256:10.53]Thank you, I'm being corrected here.
[256:12.11]It's William.
[256:14.50]William, thanks for the three bucks.
[256:18.66]Well, if you're not here anymore, thanks for watching.
[256:22.00]Hopefully we see you again soon.
[256:30.60]Don't waste your talent.
[256:32.56]Come to the UK.
[256:33.58]Wait, what?
[256:39.57]Oh, let me see.
[256:39.97]I want to see this.
[256:43.08]130,000.
[256:44.28]Over $130,000 total raised so far for direct relief.
[256:49.81]12 more days to show support.
[256:50.95]Cheer and include hashtag charity.
[256:52.35]$130,000.
[256:53.37]Damn.
[256:53.61]I just saw it pop up on the screen.
[257:03.01]Hashtag charities.
[257:06.39]If you want to include it in that.
[257:08.73]Which, that's awesome.
[257:09.37]That's a lot of money.
[257:14.64]But anyways, thank you Dr. Clay for the $1.
[257:17.62]You're the only streamer I know of who can build a birdhouse on stream and make it watchable still.
[257:22.56]Take care.
[257:23.04]Hashtag charity.
[257:27.24]Well, watchable or not, it was something I was going to do.
[257:33.76]And I don't know, I kind of had fun.
[257:35.75]That was fun for me.
[257:42.87]In quotes, watchable.
[257:45.93]You, you bastard.
[257:49.49]Sdogman, thanks for the $1.
[257:50.77]Hey Jerma, if you ever did a holiday, if you ever did a holiday to Australia, would you consider aligning it with a con of some kind so we could meet our esteemed streamer?
[258:00.95]I wanted to donate 10,000 last time, but 5,000 bits costs over a hundred fucking dollars.
[258:08.50]You deserve it.
[258:08.98]You're an idol to me and many more.
[258:10.12]I love you, man.
[258:12.94]Holy shit.
[258:13.90]Why is it, why is that so much money?
[258:17.81]Why is 5,000 bits over a hundred dollars in Australia?
[258:28.71]That's an insane.
[258:33.21]That's an exchange.
[258:33.97]That's the exchange rate and like the tax that's fucked up.
[258:45.36]but anyways um yeah don't worry about that don't worry about wanting to give me like a hundred dollars or fifty dollars that's not important thank you for even considering it but yeah if I ever decide I mean Australia that's a long ways away
[259:11.09]Australia is... That's a trip.
[259:14.27]That's like a two-week long trip.
[259:18.55]You can't really just go to Australia.
[259:20.51]I live in the US.
[259:21.41]Let's just go to Australia for a few days.
[259:23.97]I would want to spend at least a couple weeks there.
[259:31.89]Maybe one day.
[259:32.91]But if I was going to go there, it would have to be for... I'd want to line it up with at least a couple of particular reasons why I would go.
[259:43.25]Three months in a balloon.
[259:45.99]But, thank you.
[259:47.53]Sdogman, appreciate it.
[259:49.99]Maybe one day I'll make my way over to Australia.
[259:51.95]Let's put it on the list.
[259:58.32]Agent Pigeon, thanks for the $1.
[259:59.28]I love you, Jerma.
[260:00.78]If you could please tell this girl... No, I'm not doing that.
[260:05.44]What?
[260:07.07]Also, eat my... I'm not naming these two people.
[260:16.87]Thank you Sdogman again for the one dollar.
[260:18.92]Oh, also, I use FL Studio a lot.
[260:22.10]If you need help getting the hang of things, message me on the Discord or something.
[260:24.77]Would love to be able to contribute.
[260:27.89]Yeah, there's a lot of talented fucking people.
[260:31.07]And I definitely would, before that stream, I'd probably hop into a channel.
[260:36.16]There's also, like, I want to make a game design channel on the Discord eventually here because I want to see how many people are interested and how many people... Because I've seen people making games.
[260:49.84]I've seen at least two instances, three instances of people making playable video games.
[260:55.40]And it's fucking really cool.
[260:57.86]So... It would be nice to have a place for that.
[261:07.89]And somewhere down the line, I would love to... I don't know.
[261:11.17]I always have trouble saying stuff like this because it's not necessarily true.
[261:17.36]But I have a lot of things that I'd like to do.
[261:19.90]A lot of things that interest me.
[261:20.90]I have a lot of ideas that I'd like to try to have happen.
[261:23.94]Now, how many of these things are realities, right?
[261:27.12]You watched me over the course of four years talk about how badly I wanted to write something, write a book.
[261:33.53]I started it, I tried it, and every few months I'd be like, yeah, I'm trying.
[261:37.75]And then like a year went by and it's like, I don't think I can do this.
[261:41.22]And then like a year ago, it was like, that's never going to happen.
[261:46.17]So I don't want to do that anymore.
[261:49.78]I don't want to be like, Hey, uh, yeah.
[261:52.02]So I'll see you next year when there's a video game that's released and that I made.
[261:56.42]No, these are ideas that I just want to see if they're possible.
[262:08.29]But the channel on the Discord would mainly just be for just general game dev talk.
[262:15.46]Because a lot of you guys are interested in it too.
[262:18.04]You know, it's not just me that eventually that'd be fun to make a game at some point, wouldn't it?
[262:23.38]Wouldn't that be like fun to do in like a few years or something, right?
[262:27.78]The bullet hell thing was a game.
[262:29.20]There's somebody else working on another game.
[262:33.86]Somebody made a whole Mugen template for me.
[262:36.62]There's a lot of you guys that are interested.
[262:38.02]So it might be fun to do.
[262:39.60]To have a place where you could go talk about it.
[262:48.10]But yeah.
[262:51.00]Getting close to the end here.
[262:57.54]Thank you, DinkyDuper, for the $1.
[262:59.20]Hey, did you see that Jeremy guy on Twitch?
[263:00.72]Yeah, man, he went ballistic over a birdhouse.
[263:02.90]What a boomer.
[263:03.93]He started smashing stuff and then sniffed a whole jar of paint and pooped a blood vessel.
[263:09.21]Still doesn't live up to Bill Crazy, though.
[263:11.21]I mean, how are you going to beat him?
[263:13.45]Thank you, Kyra Toby, for the $1.
[263:15.96]Rats, rats with rats.
[263:18.62]Celebrating yet another milestone bash.
[263:22.30]Jeremy, $200k this week.
[263:25.72]Jeremiah Venus, coffee and Cheez-Its are on the way and Jeremy's been such a good streamer this year.
[263:30.20]Jeremiah Heart, open up your bits while we all cheer.
[263:34.80]There's a lot of emotes in there.
[263:37.04]But yeah, I got past 200,000.
[263:37.52]Not 200,000 beaters.
[263:37.84]Well, sure, whatever.
[263:38.42]200,000 followers.
[263:39.12]Happened, I think, yesterday.
[263:40.88]Offstream.
[263:54.95]2,000... 200,500.
[263:54.99]So thanks a lot, guys.
[264:04.46]I think we passed 100,000 almost exactly a year ago today.
[264:09.94]That was back last year, right?
[264:11.50]Beginning of last year?
[264:12.30]It's been about a year and a half.
[264:16.36]Just under a year, maybe?
[264:19.20]That's 100,000 followers in a year.
[264:23.72]Thank you.
[264:24.94]That's fucking awesome.
[264:27.02]You guys are too good to me.
[264:31.36]Uh, but... Thank you, KyroToby.
[264:37.85]Thank you.
[264:38.17]Double D, again, doubled for the one dollar.

[265:26.36]Bake a cake on stream and then threaten your neighbors into eating it.
[265:28.56]If they try to refuse, say 4,000 people will know how they failed.
[265:37.10]Boba Fett Wars.
[265:37.84]Again, four more dollars from Boba Fett Wars.
[265:40.04]I don't know if bits went through.

[267:17.06]No, that was a joke.
[267:18.38]It was a joke, and it was just for fun.
[267:23.77]Sell the Logitech keyboard and buy these keyboard pants.
[267:29.21]Extra cheesy, thanks for the one dollar.
[267:30.71]No, I'm not gonna buy keyboard pants.
[267:42.63]How would these even work?
[267:45.57]This is just a joke, right?
[267:54.44]Those don't actually do anything.
[267:57.80]Although that would kind of be kind of good.
[267:59.72]I am not even fucking kidding.
[268:04.84]I think I would want to use those.
[268:08.83]Because your hands, think of where your hands are naturally resting when you're just sitting in a chair.
[268:14.53]WASD is right there.
[268:20.22]I don't know, those kind of, those are kind of cool.
[268:25.70]Maybe I'll do a stream one day where I just hook up a bunch of elaborate gamer gear all over me.
[268:32.30]And do like the gamer android man stream.
[268:41.55]Alright, put that on the list of things to do.
[268:47.09]Uh, thank you, Art Vandelay, exporter of another 25 center.

[269:35.84]Uh, yeah, you know, you know, yeah, I do.
[269:38.04]I do.
[269:38.92]I do have something special.

[269:45.36]You know what it is?
[269:47.04]All you guys.
[269:48.32]Because you thought that that was worth watching.
[269:54.04]That's the special part.
[269:57.00]Because... You know, like, I'm very lucky.
[270:08.00]that we can just have fun doing that.
[270:13.65]I'm grateful to have a fun, laid-back, a little bit on the Loose Cannon side, but, community.
[270:28.32]You guys make this even more fun for me.
[270:31.28]So, absolutely.
[270:41.73]Why is sub and donate time without facecam?
[270:44.63]Well, that's because I don't like facecam.
[270:52.21]Oh, whoops.
[270:54.27]I don't like facecam.
[270:55.11]I don't like having facecam on.
[270:58.97]Because I'm a fucking weirdo.
[271:01.22]And I do a lot of weird shit with my face.
[271:03.54]I've gone back and watched VODs.
[271:06.88]Where I- I- Well, let me take a look at how that went.
[271:10.06]I want to see a particular section to see how that went.
[271:12.72]And I'm like this.
[271:13.30]It's just like, I don't- What are you doing, dude?
[271:28.97]Why?
[271:32.58]This whole sec- there was a whole, like, 25 minute section of the stream one time.
[271:36.74]Where I had my mouth, my lips, just going like this.
[271:47.50]It's just like, are you gonna eat it or are you gonna spit it out?
[272:06.80]I did the wrong... I clicked... I... I clicked the... I thought that was connected to this, but it's not.
[272:13.25]I thought it was fucking connected.
[272:17.01]Hey, thank you Timmy Tim Tim for the $1.
[272:18.37]Was your pizza good on Thursday?
[272:20.65]It was muy delicious.
[272:23.33]Yeah, it was very good.
[272:26.10]I'm trying to gauge whether or not how I feel, and I feel kind of bad.
[272:28.48]I've had bread the last couple of days, and I do feel a little worse than I did a few days ago.
[272:36.60]I don't know.
[272:39.48]I got a fucking laundry list for this doctor.
[272:42.16]Because this is a new doctor.
[272:44.80]Right?
[272:45.12]I moved across the country.
[272:46.18]So I'm going to be like, okay, listen.
[272:47.72]Let me tell you.
[272:48.50]All these fucked up things that are wrong with my body.
[272:51.18]He's going to tell me to leave.
[272:53.04]I'm going to get the music at the doctor's office.
[273:00.31]The doctor is going to pretend to get a phone call.
[273:02.55]Because we're going to be talking about this for so long.
[273:06.75]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[273:09.85]Oh, sorry.
[273:10.19]I gotta take this.
[273:11.25]Man, sorry to hear about all that.
[273:13.17]Just go down to the lab and we'll take some blood.
[273:14.79]Alright, bye.
[273:24.26]But thank you to... Thank you to Trocephalia for the $1.
[273:30.19]Get exposed.
[273:30.95]You just pronounced my name wrong, too.
[273:33.33]It's...
[273:34.98]Dro... it's Dro-soph-illa.
[273:39.62]Though at this point, I might just let it be our little thing.
[273:46.07]Yeah, there is no I-A.
[273:51.83]Dro-soph-illa.
[273:52.67]Alright, I got it.
[273:57.45]Dro-soph-illa.
[273:58.87]Dro-soph-illa.
[274:00.33]Dro-soph-illa.
[274:02.01]Dro-soph-illa.
[274:05.32]I have trouble reading.
[274:07.76]Thank you.
[274:09.50]Drosophila.
[274:10.88]Appreciate it.
[274:16.16]Yes.
[274:16.36]No.
[274:16.58]Wait, what do you mean yes?
[274:17.59]No.
[274:17.99]Drosophila.
[274:20.11]I'll go with Drill.
[274:25.81]Hey, Drill.
[274:27.09]It's quicker.
[274:32.37]I snapped and it fucking turned back on.
[274:34.03]Got the delayed magic.
[274:35.67]Whatever.
[274:40.57]Thank you to... Spuds.
[274:45.43]Spuds for the $1.
[274:46.33]Hashtag charity.
[274:47.05]Hey, Jerma.
[274:48.17]Thanks for the stream today.
[274:49.17]What's a good dad gift?
[274:51.13]I need ideas.
[274:52.65]A nice pair of memory foam slippers.
[274:56.78]The good ones.
[274:59.13]Get a nice pair of memory foam house slippers.
[275:01.89]Your dad's gonna fucking love them.
[275:08.11]That's a guarantee.
[275:12.03]Timmy Tim, Tim, thanks for the $1.
[275:12.87]Was your pizza good?
[275:13.87]I already answered it.
[275:14.71]Yes.
[275:16.24]I don't know why that- I read that one again.
[275:17.86]Thank you Marty20k for the two bucks.
[275:19.60]Hey Jerma, just wanted to let you know, uh, my feet smell real bad right now, party.
[275:25.16]Okay, party, party.
[275:26.92]That's wonderful.
[275:28.16]I'm really glad to hear that.
[275:30.15]That's fantastic.
[275:32.31]Oh, thank you.
[275:33.67]Uh, Dark Prime, thanks for the five dollars.
[275:38.21]I love your streams.
[275:39.11]Would you care to check out a green screen video I made?
[275:41.75]It's called The Germinator.
[275:47.76]Uh, well, I did say a while ago that we weren't going to do them, uh, in, like, bit messages, but I think what I'm going to do, I think what I'm going to do is there may be, there may be a movie night encore.
[276:07.75]And what I mean by that is not like a five or six hour long stream.
[276:16.16]We're talking like an end of the stream kind of deal here.
[276:19.80]Hey, here's like movie night encore.
[276:22.28]And we're talking like maybe 30 to 40 minutes of other ones that have come in since.
[276:27.18]You know what I mean?
[276:36.87]Because there were a lot of submissions that I've talked about.
[276:39.31]Hey, it's not just going to be for one day.
[276:40.59]Maybe we'll do it again.
[276:41.45]And we probably will.
[276:43.03]Because I've already seen at least a dozen that were not on the movie night that were very, very good.
[276:50.45]Just do it every couple of months.
[276:53.15]Yeah, but if we were going to do it every couple of months, I'd want to give more material.
[276:57.69]Because there's only so much you can do with like... Like a fucking raptor.
[277:03.10]There needs to be more.
[277:04.94]If it's going to be a regular thing.
[277:16.35]Kiwo uploaded like six already.
[277:26.33]That's so funny.
[277:30.81]Six.
[277:34.41]I actually saw one on Twitter.
[277:36.61]It was fucking funny.
[277:42.24]But if I was going to do more of that, I would want to do more.
[277:46.74]So maybe I would do another green screen appearance.
[277:51.65]Like the green screen bonus pack.
[277:55.27]I don't know.
[277:56.83]One thing at a time.
[277:57.99]I got this Christmas stream that I need to get ready.
[278:00.61]And one step at a time.
[278:04.33]Green screen DLC.
[278:09.08]But hopefully that answers your question, Dark Prime.
[278:13.42]We will probably see it very soon.
[278:16.04]Disproved.
[278:45.49]Can I go one stream without doing that?
[278:50.91]Okay, I'm not allowed to say that tomorrow.
[279:10.50]When I'm doing Hotline Miami 2 tomorrow, I'm not allowed to say, Peter, tomorrow.
[279:15.62]Call me out on it if I do.
[279:16.56]Because I'm not going to.
[279:19.36]Hey, thank you, Marty20k again for $1.
[279:23.72]Hashtag charity.
[279:24.60]I forgot what to say.
[279:26.32]Oh, man.
[279:29.96]What were you going to say?
[279:32.78]Thank you, Isner, for the $10. $10.
[279:37.98]Thank you so much for the $10 here.
[279:39.52]I'll never be the one guy if I only lurk.
[279:42.52]Checkmate, Jeremy.
[279:43.44]Oh, and hashtag charity.
[279:48.77]And never be the one guy if you lurk.
[279:50.33]Well, you have to be the one guy.
[279:52.57]You have to be if you say something.
[279:56.95]But thank you for the $10 and thank you for putting the hashtag charity there as well.
[280:01.17]Thank you.
[280:03.41]Dark Prime again for $5.
[280:04.69]Thank you.
[280:04.99]I appreciate your streams.
[280:06.03]Would you care to check out the green screen video?
[280:08.53]I think maybe it didn't go through the first time.
[280:11.69]Anyway, that's $10 total here.
[280:15.04]I was late to the party, but I think you'd love it.
[280:17.28]Hashtag charity.
[280:18.00]Thank you for putting the hashtag charity there.
[280:19.98]Hopefully I answered your question.
[280:21.40]Hopefully you're still here.
[280:23.70]Hold on to that.
[280:24.86]Because we will probably put it into a small compilation.
[280:30.63]On green screen, Encore Night.
[280:33.19]At the end of another stream at some point over the next... Probably in the early 2019.
[280:37.71]After the Christmas stream.
[280:39.63]Because that gives some more time for people to get some, and we'll do another little thing, and... You hang on to that.
[280:49.02]Thank you Sdogman again for the $1 on the bits thing.
[280:51.20]Yeah.
[280:52.06]A U D T U S D plus G S T. And I guess there's the online tax entertainment tax shit.
[280:59.63]Yeah, it's an around the world thing.
[281:01.53]Traveling here.
[281:02.31]I've wanted to go to America, but likewise it's a big commitment to make and a lot of travel.
[281:08.35]Yeah.
[281:09.59]Travel's hard no matter how far you go.
[281:12.45]You go an hour you know, to another state.
[281:17.89]You go
[281:19.55]Yeah, I'm going, uh, I'm gonna go up to... I'm gonna go to Maine for the weekend, right, when I was in Massachusetts.
[281:26.11]That's like a four-hour drive, and that, like, that sucks.
[281:28.45]It's a long way.
[281:31.94]So... Any type of travel is stressful, especially going that far.
[281:37.68]Five minutes to McDonald's, yeah, it's like, it's fucking a lot.
[281:42.79]Why can't McDonald's just deliver?
[281:50.19]But yeah, anytime you get it like on an airplane or you travel by boat or more than four or five hours in a car, it's always a pain in the ass.
[282:03.15]Man, maybe one day you'll come over here.
[282:07.55]Uber Rats, what?
[282:13.19]Thank you Marty20k again for $2.
[282:15.17]Hey, Jerma985, where's the ocean the deepest?
[282:19.45]At the bottom.
[282:22.73]I threw up.
[282:23.65]I just puked because I read that.
[282:26.83]Hey Novi, thanks for the $1.
[282:28.11]Congrats on the 200,000 Jermamites.
[282:30.09]Hashtag charity.
[282:30.81]Thank you.
[282:34.55]200,000 of you guys.
[282:38.69]Timmy Timtan, thanks for the $1.
[282:39.65]I'm running out of these daily TV videos.
[282:42.47]I think are funny very quickly.
[282:48.49]I'm running out of these.
[282:50.01]I love how you can run out of them.
[282:52.67]Like you've had a supply.
[282:56.28]Excuse me.
[282:57.48]May I see your license?
[282:58.91]I'm afraid I've left it at home.
[283:00.90]In that case, you'll have to take it to the police station within five days.
[283:05.02]But why?
[283:06.12]You were speeding, ma'am.
[283:07.29]But I was only doing 75.
[283:08.59]There's a 70-kilometer-hour speed limit on this road, ma'am.
[283:12.43]Is there?
[283:12.85]I didn't see a sign.
[283:14.69]Well, ma'am, we've been following you.
[283:16.99]So you were doing 75, too.
[283:19.75]No, ma'am.
[283:20.53]We were doing 90 kilometers an hour, and we couldn't catch you.
[283:23.75]Wait.
[283:25.15]90 kilometers an hour?
[283:26.45]Isn't that like...
[283:29.70]That's like 30 miles per hour.
[283:31.40]Isn't it like 40 miles per hour?
[283:40.57]Boomer can't do math.
[283:41.65]I don't work in kilometers.
[283:43.35]I don't work in kilometers.
[283:46.83]I work in miles per hour.
[283:54.86]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim.
[283:55.70]Thank you, Chubby Funster for the $1.
[283:56.90]Hey, Jeremy, you make me laugh, so I guess you're funny or something.
[283:59.53]Shrug.
[284:00.51]Just for confirmation, your fursona would be a rat, right?
[284:03.27]I'm sure you'll answer this and not laugh nervously and move on from it.
[284:08.33]No.
[284:08.81]Hashtag charity.
[284:09.41]No, my fursona would be...
[284:11.68]If I were to have one, like an alternate... Look, haven't you seen that Spider-Man movie where they're all different Spider-Mans from different Spider-Man universes?
[284:17.72]There's a bunch of you already.
[284:19.46]The one Jerma that is in a fursuit right now somewhere that exists in some alternate timeline is probably in a big slippy toad costume.
[284:37.74]This one.
[284:38.39]No, not this one.
[284:45.09]Or, uh... I was gonna say goblin.
[284:49.44]But that's not an animal.
[284:53.18]That is a mythical creature.
[284:55.92]Can a goblin be a fursona?
[284:59.56]It can, right?
[285:00.16]Like a goblin, is that technically an otherworldly mythical animal?
[285:16.29]Goblins don't have fur.
[285:18.94]Who cares?
[285:23.92]Well, yeah, that's two different alternate timelines.
[285:27.36]One of them's a frog, one of them's a toad, and one of them is a rat.
[285:31.92]One of them's a goblin.
[285:34.10]One of them is a wolf.
[285:37.50]And then in this timeline, it's a leopard.
[285:41.58]So...
[285:47.69]God damn it, whatever.
[285:52.83]Okay.
[285:59.25]I really gotta, like, put this to bed.
[286:04.40]One of them is a human.
[286:05.06]It's this one.
[286:12.86]Thank you, MoistN, for the $1.
[286:15.61]I've been watching your YouTube videos forever.
[286:18.15]So glad I finally started to watch your stream.
[286:19.81]Keep doing what you do and love your stuff.
[286:22.13]Thank you, Moist.
[286:23.19]Thanks for the $1.
[286:25.95]Cook, thank you, Cook, for the $1.
[286:27.09]Jeremy, you rock my socks.
[286:28.95]I hope you're doing well and keep us smiling.
[286:32.86]I'm going to just keep doing what I'm doing.
[286:34.86]If you like it, then you do.
[286:35.78]Thank you.
[286:38.30]Thanks for liking it.
[286:40.10]Thanks for hanging out.
[286:43.40]Socks rocked, confirmed.
[286:46.12]Hey Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[286:47.66]If you don't title the Gamer Gear stream, the Bionic Boomer, I will unsubscribe.
[286:57.23]It's the Bionic Boomer.
[287:00.91]I'm gonna get one of those eye trackers and track the screen and shit.
[287:05.56]I'm gonna be so plugged in.
[287:06.76]There's gonna be so many cords all over me.
[287:09.62]The Bionic Boomer.
[287:16.17]I'm gonna look so shitty too.
[287:18.83]A heartbeat sensor.
[287:19.99]I'm gonna- oh my god.
[287:21.67]Don't tell me to do all this.
[287:24.40]I'm gonna do this like soon.
[287:26.08]I'm gonna get so much fucked up shit.
[287:29.40]I'm gonna get like a virtual boy.
[287:30.76]I'm gonna take my blood sugar in the middle of the stream.
[287:38.58]Although I don't think I can do that.
[287:41.68]Can I, like, take my- can I, like, read my blood sugar in the middle of the stream?
[287:44.95]I don't think I'm- I don't think I'd be allowed to do that.
[287:46.59]That, like, breaks TOS.
[287:55.80]What if it was really fucking bad?
[288:01.42]Oh, by the- look at- it's been long enough.
[288:03.62]Can I tell you guys the thing that I- that I'm so pissed off that I didn't get a chance to do?
[288:08.37]During the lie detector stream...
[288:11.06]So I purchased a bunch of medical shit.
[288:14.55]I bought one of those blood spinning machines.
[288:18.75]One of those things where you put all the blood tubes in and it... I purchased one.
[288:25.27]I actually fucking bought one.
[288:28.02]And the thing I was gonna do is I was gonna...
[288:31.88]This is too bad.
[288:32.66]I'm so sad that this didn't happen.
[288:34.88]But we were gonna do an elaborate thing, me and the doctor, where every question, instead of just asking a question and then like reading and saying, oh, that was a lie, that wasn't a lie, he was gonna take up, he was gonna draw blood from me.
[288:49.80]Every question.
[288:51.34]So he was gonna ask a question and then draw blood, put it in the spinning machine, and then put it under a microscope and then determine if it was a lie.
[288:59.78]And the whole joke was, over the course of the stream, I was going to be losing so much blood.
[289:05.02]That like, okay, yeah, it takes a while.
[289:06.58]We're going to do like 20, 30 questions.
[289:10.87]And I was going to like go get like water and come back with like blue skin.
[289:16.75]Like I was draining all my blood.
[289:19.47]And then I realized that like breaks a lot of rules here.
[289:29.92]I bought, like, fake syringes and shit, and I'm like, wait, I can't do that.
[289:35.23]I don't think I can do that.
[289:43.12]But I was, like, laughing my ass off about it.
[289:45.52]Me and, uh... The guy that helps me do most of the videos and stuff.
[289:50.30]We were just like... Oh, and the doctor was gonna look up every now and again.
[289:54.01]He was gonna look through the microscope and be like, Ah, this is the most full of shit blood I've ever seen in my life.
[290:02.19]Like, why would you need that to determine if it's a lie or not?
[290:09.21]There you go.
[290:10.11]That's, uh...
[290:12.35]There's some insight on that stream.
[290:15.11]I couldn't do the draw blood from me until I like am fucking turning into... Like I was gonna be like falling asleep and shit and he's gonna be like waking me up to ask more questions and draw more blood.
[290:30.10]And then we were like, nah, I think that's a little too much.
[290:43.18]I'm gonna need a piss sample.
[290:51.77]Because we were trying to think of ways that if you took a lie detector, what would you not ever have to do?
[291:04.14]But yeah, that was part of one of the ideas that just never ended up... And I still, I fucking had the machine up until I moved.
[291:11.00]I was trying to think about another way to use that machine.
[291:14.87]And I couldn't.
[291:15.79]It was just not enough time.
[291:16.67]No, he wasn't really going to be drawing any blood from me.
[291:28.82]It was going to be all fake.
[291:41.11]How much did it cost?
[291:41.91]It wasn't that expensive because, I don't know, somebody was like getting rid of it, weirdly enough.
[291:52.11]Bionic Boomer, we have the technology.
[291:56.75]Yeah, now that I think about it, what the fuck was all that shit?
[292:05.95]How much was it?
[292:09.19]I can't say.
[292:10.69]I can't say.
[292:12.99]What can I say?
[292:15.27]I don't still have it.
[292:17.11]Look, there was only a certain amount of stuff I could put when I moved, right?
[292:23.81]So when I was stuffing up boxes and shit, the big spinning blood machine is not something that it was a priority to bring to Vegas.
[292:38.63]How do you come up with this stuff?
[292:40.73]I don't know.
[292:42.72]I don't know.
[292:46.06]You still took the machinima shot glass.
[292:48.60]Um, excuse me.
[292:51.15]The machinima shot glass is like an inch tall.
[292:54.45]The blood machine was a fucking huge machine.
[292:57.57]It was giant.
[292:58.61]It was a big, heavy, clunky machine that made a loud noise.
[293:09.07]Alright, let's finish this up.
[293:14.19]But, uh, look forward, I look forward to the Bionic Boomer stream.
[293:19.21]Put it on the list.
[293:21.49]Thank you, uh, Lull Amour for the $1.
[293:25.03]Found you on your old Layers of Fear YouTube stream, where you were dying laughing when the baby was hitting the wall.
[293:31.68]Been hooked on you since.
[293:33.74]Love your stuff, you always make my day.
[293:35.02]Hope you're well and merry, whatever it is you celebrate.
[293:38.10]Thank you.
[293:44.06]That... That was the hardest... That was one of the hardest composures I've ever had to... Because that had a facecam on.
[293:51.43]I was desperately trying to keep my cool and not look like a weirdo.
[293:55.25]But how do you keep your cool when something like that's happening?
[293:57.35]I don't know.
[294:03.11]Back when I had short hair.
[294:04.25]Yeah.
[294:10.89]But thank you, Lalamore.
[294:13.62]Uh, right back at you as well.
[294:16.36]Whatever, uh, merry whateverous, whatever you celebrate.
[294:20.60]Thank you.
[294:22.10]Alright, only a few more.
[294:22.94]Extra cheesy things for the one dollar.
[294:24.21]You could wear these with the pants.
[294:28.23]Uh, mouse belt buckle.
[294:33.43]Hello?
[294:34.13]Why is there a craziestgadgets.com?
[294:38.76]What the fuck is that dumb website?
[294:44.30]Is that website just in the back of the seat on an airplane?
[294:50.29]Like that mall, whatever it is, like the weird shit that used to be in the mall?
[294:56.93]Not the mall, in the back of an airplane.
[295:01.00]The Sky Mall.
[295:08.96]It's gonna be all, it is going to be a joke.
[295:11.98]If you think that the birdhouse stream was just like, oh, somebody said, look at these pants.
[295:17.96]Hey, build a birdhouse.
[295:19.63]This is gonna, I'm taking this to a hundred now.
[295:22.85]The Bionic Boomer is going to, it's gonna happen, and I'm going to be decked out head to toe.
[295:29.17]There's not going to be a fucking inch of my body that does not have a peripheral attached to it.
[295:34.43]It's gonna take hours to go through them all.
[295:47.44]I'm gonna attach you know those little claws those like robotic hands like those things that you can reach up that grandma uses to grab stuff We're gonna like pour a drink I'm gonna have a robot on me like moving an arm and shit.
[296:00.12]I
[296:15.31]Oh, spill drink joke incoming.
[296:20.55]You're gonna spill a drink.
[296:25.15]Not on this desk.
[296:31.75]I love this so much.
[296:34.49]But thank you, ExtraCheesy, for the belt buckle.
[296:36.13]Thank you, Marty20k, for the five bucks.
[296:38.03]Hearing you read my messages is making me regret giving bits while drunk.
[296:43.07]Sorry and thank you.
[296:44.03]Alright, that's enough!
[296:45.69]No more bits!
[296:46.27]Uh, no more bits anyways, because the stream is pretty much over.
[296:51.07]But thank you, Marty20k, for the $5.
[296:52.81]And no more drunk bits, okay?
[296:59.53]If you spill a drink on the Bionic Boomer, he dies.
[297:05.95]I actually want it to be hard to move.
[297:09.24]I'm going to need help here.
[297:11.94]I'm going to make an elaborate suit that is going to be physically difficult for me to actually move.
[297:19.27]It's going to be very hard.
[297:27.25]Thank you, Windar, for the $1.
[297:32.15]If we do a movie night encore, will there be limitations on what we watch?
[297:36.55]Like, is it possible to avoid 15 to 20 vids of JoJo stuff?
[297:40.75]They're fun to watch, but they took up a lot of the first movie night.
[297:46.09]I would probably say it would be...
[297:52.19]I don't know, I don't know.
[297:53.67]I can't really... I can't say.
[297:57.21]Because... I haven't thought too much about it until right now.
[298:02.29]So I don't want to give rules and guidelines on something that I haven't even personally thought about yet.
[298:07.27]So... We'll talk about that at a later date, when I can get a more clear idea of what I would like to do.
[298:17.65]But, we'll see.
[298:19.78]And then finally, uh, SolomonTheSquid, thanks for the two dollars.
[298:23.18]Hey Jerma, love the stream.
[298:24.02]Was wondering if you ever had made progress on that book you said you were writing a year back.
[298:28.14]It's no big deal to me if you decided to cut it all together or put it on hold.
[298:33.59]I just wanted to know if there was any cool details you'd like to share on it.
[298:39.79]Well, I actually, I've talked about the book not only tonight, but I put the can on it probably like a year or two ago.
[298:51.28]Remember we were streaming, I don't know what we were playing, but I like actually put the nail in the coffin like a couple of years ago, didn't I?
[299:05.84]It was gonna be a choose-your-own-adventure book wrote with this engine that I was learning.
[299:14.22]Tell us the end of the book now that it's dead.
[299:16.88]How far did it get?
[299:18.82]I didn't- I copy and pasted like a bunch of shit in here.
[299:22.38]Remember that?
[299:23.67]How long- how many of you guys were here for that?
[299:26.17]I copy and pasted probably like 1500 words in here.
[299:32.39]Was it Twine?
[299:33.09]It was not Twine.
[299:34.07]It was the... It was the Ink... The Inkling Rider.
[299:39.17]No, not Inkling.
[299:40.31]The Inkle.
[299:42.61]Inkle Rider.
[299:53.86]Woom?
[299:54.28]What is this Woom?
[299:55.08]What are you guys doing?
[300:00.99]Weren't there like a dozen pages that got pasted?
[300:02.95]Yeah, I just like copy and pasted all the shit that was there.
[300:05.57]Oh, oh, okay.
[300:12.96]But that's it.
[300:14.84]Talked about it.
[300:16.44]I'm surprised that people were asking about it.
[300:19.11]Was anybody asking about it?
[300:20.01]Did I just go off?
[300:21.95]Because I thought I did kind of put the nail in it like a year or two ago.
[300:28.09]When I copy and pasted everything.
[300:37.24]Because we like your stuff.
[300:38.49]Oh, okay.
[300:44.03]It was a lot of fun to try to make.
[300:45.77]But here's the next part of this that needs to be addressed.
[300:50.42]To do something like that, that's what you have to do.
[300:53.66]You know what I mean?
[300:55.16]I can't, like... Unless I, like, wrote that book on stream...
[300:59.70]it would never get done, because that's what I'm doing right now, you know?
[301:03.44]There's only so much time in a day where if you focus on something, that's kind of what you're focusing on.
[301:15.26]Stream making an adventure book.
[301:17.55]Yeah, but that's... as much as everybody says that that's something fun to do, I don't work well that way.
[301:25.29]I have to be, like, silent, just staring at a screen when I come up with something that I want to try or write, or... Talk, you know, like, uh, when I came up with, like, you know, the getting blood taken from me and put in the, uh, in the spinning machine for the lie detector.
[301:37.32]I mean, I was silent, just staring at the screen.
[301:45.51]Smart click, so you guys write it for me.
[301:50.65]No.
[301:52.53]Anyways, that is going to be it.
[301:53.91]We got a few more here.
[301:57.43]Thank you.
[302:00.23]Cool42.
[302:00.82]Thanks for the $1.
[302:02.40]By the way, the name's pronounced Cole, not cool.
[302:05.22]And for some strange reason, I watched like five ads and didn't get any bits for them, which caused this message to get delayed.
[302:11.76]Anyway, now that I'm here, I'm not really sure what to say other than you're a great streamer, and I'm looking forward to future streams and future bionic booming.
[302:19.67]Hashtag charity.
[302:20.65]Thank you, Cole.
[302:22.88]Thank you Timmy Timtan for the $1.
[302:24.20]Can you get some money out of your money bath and order me a pizza?
[302:28.48]Be there in five minutes.
[302:30.18]Uh, FGW, thank you for the $1.
[302:31.98]Hey Jerm, I recently got my first car.
[302:34.43]It is a compact SUV.
[302:36.37]So my friends and I nicknamed it the streamer mobile.
[302:39.83]All in fun.
[302:40.49]Love the stream.
[302:41.95]That's a pretty good car.
[302:45.35]Compact cars are great.
[302:46.37]You can get them anywhere.
[302:47.31]You can fit it in a lot of spots.
[302:51.20]Uh, and then here is from ExtraCheesy, here's another dollar, here's a wearable TV.
[303:01.35]A fucking wearable TV.
[303:06.22]I'm probably gonna get... Alright, you guys ready?
[303:08.54]You guys ready for like, this is like the stream where like Jeremy gets sued?
[303:12.62]I'm gonna have like QVC on that fucking TV.
[303:16.33]The whole stream.
[303:22.28]This is the... Wow, the credits roll.
[303:24.80]Somebody just linked to this.
[303:26.56]Thank you for all the subs that came in.
[303:30.61]They were a lot tonight, so thank you guys so much.
[303:32.37]We're the rats.
[303:42.59]We pray at night.
[303:43.69]We stalk at night.
[303:45.14]We're the rats.
[303:47.59]I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules.
[303:51.89]Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.
[303:57.65]Rats, we're the rats.
[304:01.03]We pray at night, we stalk at night.
[304:03.61]We're the rats.
[304:10.01]Why are there so many of these?
[304:13.45]Heartbeat sensor, gloves, eye trackers, yeah.
[304:23.72]I'm... I'm picturing the way that I'm going to look in my head that is making me laugh every time.
[304:30.44]So that's how you know that it's a... That's how you know that it's worth doing.
[304:35.16]A thermometer sticking out of my mouth.
[304:48.03]Picture the robot Labo?
[304:49.29]Yeah, but way more.
[304:52.88]for the actual... Dude, I better be careful.
[304:54.96]I'm gonna get, like, fucking electrocuted.
[304:56.44]Imagine if I had, like, a toaster or something.
[305:02.77]Like a... Some type of... Like an Easy-Pake oven.
[305:18.13]Make food, okay, put a whole chicken in like a rotisserie and have that like on my back as like a backpack and cook it the whole stream.
[305:34.94]He's the ultimate weapon.
[305:38.41]And then eat that at the end.
[305:39.41]Do you remember, that will kill you.
[305:46.21]Nah, I'll be careful.
[305:47.11]If it's too dangerous, I won't do it.
[305:54.53]Somebody just wrote, you will, you're gonna burn.
[305:58.41]I'm gonna get like a burn.
[306:18.85]Internet streamer burns down house.
[306:23.23]Pretending to be a robot on live stream.
[306:30.12]Imagine the write-up of that article.
[306:32.92]Going by his fake superhero name, the Bionic Boomer.
[306:45.86]Anyways, I'm out of here, guys.
[306:47.92]Have a great rest of your night.
[306:48.74]I'll see you tomorrow for Hotline Miami 2.
[306:53.65]I can't promise we're gonna complete the whole thing, but we're gonna play it for a while.
[306:57.71]So we'll see how far we get.
[307:00.09]See you real soon.
[307:00.77]Thanks for coming out.
[307:03.63]Take care, everybody.
[307:23.56]Thank you, ExtraCheesy, for the one dollar.
[307:25.59]Oh, how'd you get that nasty burn?
[307:28.45]I cooked a turkey in a backpack while wearing it.
