[00:00.79]Ladies and gentlemen, we are now live.
[00:02.81]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04.13]Welcome to the stream where Star just writes countless things in the chat that she should never have written.
[00:11.91]And it's just being annoying.
[00:13.25]Good for him.
[00:22.70]Oh my god, that's a bad hold on a sec screen.
[00:27.70]What?
[00:28.00]I had to just do it quick.
[00:31.32]Oh my god.
[00:32.24]You are such a professional streamer, boy.
[00:34.89]I'm glad, like, oh, I've been planning for weeks and weeks to stream Armored Crockett.
[00:38.27]Got to let him off.
[00:38.89]I had even more time to prepare.
[00:40.91]Here is my, like, happy meal.
[00:43.67]BRB.
[00:45.55]Look, I don't have all that stuff.
[00:47.91]I just barely got Nightbot to work.
[00:52.03]Did you go to the Nightbot website and click Join Chat?
[00:55.36]I couldn't.
[00:56.02]I didn't have the time.
[00:57.16]Yeah, I'm moving in.
[00:58.62]Sorry I didn't have, like... I don't have, like, city skylines and, like, cool lighting effects on all my stuff.
[01:05.83]Oh, sorry, you don't have any talent.
[01:08.21]Wow.
[01:10.07]Can you believe this guy?
[01:13.01]Sometimes it's hard to believe the things that come out of his mouth.
[01:16.45]Yeah, like... But, whatever.
[01:17.73]Alright, let's switch over to Armikrog.
[01:22.92]Let me get my chat popped out.
[01:27.08]Actually, I should probably say I'm streaming this game, right?
[01:30.54]You should, and you should give people a second to join so they don't miss the opening cutscenes.
[01:34.28]Don't worry, I'm going to make sure.
[01:35.76]We're going to sit here and chat about this for a few minutes.
[01:38.66]Okay.
[01:39.44]So don't worry about it.
[01:40.76]You should color in the face while we wait.
[01:43.40]I can't do that.
[01:46.10]You just didn't even plan it.
[01:50.92]I'm doing a little bit of a tweet here.
[01:52.16]I'm using Twitter.
[01:54.50]What's your favorite thing about Twitter?
[01:58.72]um very quick thoughts very quick you know you can get your mind out there as soon as you want you know you can get your brain to do things you normally don't do do you think the government's spying on Twitter I don't fucking know I'm hearing that I'm way louder than you are you yeah
[02:23.74]When you look in OBS, you can see the speaking volume and your mic, you know, they're separate.
[02:28.02]I use those to line up, which like the equalize them a bit better.
[02:32.76]Some pro streamer tips, because I know you've never done it.
[02:35.72]Is that better?
[02:37.24]I don't know.
[02:38.14]You're going to have to ask.
[02:39.76]You tell me.
[02:40.20]I just I think I just lowered you a little.
[02:45.72]Don't worry about your tweets, dude.
[02:47.70]Don't worry about the tweets.
[02:48.64]Just tell a story while we get started here.
[02:51.76]Guys, listen.
[02:52.72]Here's the story all about how I... Belair... You suck so bad.
[03:04.65]Like, if it was me, if you brought me into your stream and you were like, oh, I gotta get some stuff set up, like, tell a story, I'd be like, listen, ladies and gentlemen, let's talk about, let's tell a story here.
[03:12.69]Yeah, thanks.
[03:13.59]Oh, let me tell you all guys about my favorite cartoon character that appears on branded material.
[03:19.13]Good, go for it, let's hear it.
[03:22.52]Aunt Jemima.
[03:25.30]Is she really anybody's aunt?
[03:27.44]Is that what she was known for?
[03:29.42]What's her deal?
[03:31.50]Did she really make that syrup, Jerma?
[03:33.28]Did she really make that syrup?
[03:37.22]I'm not even listening to a single word you're saying.
[03:39.52]Alright, that should... Okay, did that work?
[03:45.39]Alright, I tweeted.
[03:46.29]I used the Twitter function.
[03:53.20]So we're going to wait a minute here.
[03:55.70]Get yourself a snack.
[03:57.44]Find yourself a nice place to sit.
[04:01.60]Because I don't want people to miss the... Because this is a let's play of... That one just threw up in my mouth.
[04:11.21]What the hell was that?
[04:15.29]My God.
[04:18.31]I was like sick earlier.
[04:22.52]What's wrong with you?
[04:24.32]Like, let's start the stream.
[04:25.66]Let's... Oh, God.
[04:27.08]Hey, man, just let out all the voices in your head.
[04:31.86]I don't have very many.
[04:35.73]Let them all out.
[04:36.19]Alright.
[04:46.83]How loud is this?
[04:52.81]Alright, guys.
[04:53.25]How loud is this?
[04:57.21]I wonder how loud this is.
[04:58.29]I hope it's not too loud.
[04:59.35]I wonder how loud this is.
[05:01.05]I wonder if Aunt Jemima really made that.
[05:09.84]Hey!
[05:10.26]Lookit!
[05:10.58]There we are!
[05:11.30]Alright.
[05:20.18]So...
[05:22.49]For those of you that are wondering what this is... We're gonna just... Just sit here and enjoy this song.
[05:35.49]We're gonna enjoy this music.
[05:37.39]Is this the frickin' like Harariya music?
[05:39.24]What are you talking about?
[05:42.82]Alright, I lowered it a little bit more.
[05:45.38]You're about to play Spore.
[05:46.96]Alright, can you listen in on this?
[05:48.82]How does it sound?
[05:50.04]How does it sound?
[05:55.75]I thought you were going to play mobile games.
[05:59.47]No.
[06:00.89]Not today.
[06:01.99]Not today.
[06:02.75]It sounds better now.
[06:04.07]Okay.
[06:06.57]Okay.
[06:08.57]So, Armogrog, if you don't know what this is, we'll give a brief synopsis of this before we actually start playing the game.
[06:16.79]This is one of my favorite games of all time.
[06:19.59]It was a Neverhood.
[06:21.55]It came out like 20 years ago.
[06:24.23]It's a claymation game.
[06:25.47]It's a point and click.
[06:26.58]You walk around.
[06:27.20]You interact with stuff.
[06:28.02]There's a lot of dialogue.
[06:30.24]And this is the guys that made Armikrog.
[06:33.06]I mean, the guys that made Neverhood made this game.
[06:35.66]This was a Kickstarter game.
[06:37.80]And...
[06:39.10]it's really awesome because the guys that made the original game came together finally after a long time to make a new one so hopefully they still have like everything they still have the passion and they still have the creativity like they did 20 years ago so we're gonna sit here for another five I might say five minutes
[07:10.89]Maybe I'll turn up the sound during the cutscene.
[07:13.03]Maybe that should be better.
[07:18.81]Yeah.
[07:21.61]Yeah, I was listening to the volume.
[07:23.51]Everything in general seems fine.
[07:26.15]It's all a little low.
[07:28.34]People are saying, I could barely hear, but they don't understand that there's a volume slider on the website.
[07:33.67]Twitch.television.
[07:34.59]I'd look on the lower left-hand side of your screen.
[07:37.01]You're going to see a thing that looks like an old-timey, old-fashioned speaker.
[07:40.91]That's not actually what speakers are really looking like nowadays anymore.
[07:44.21]But they still use that to help people understand.
[07:46.68]You know, the same way there's a telephone.
[07:48.34]Alright.
[07:49.44]So to cut you off.
[07:52.52]This game requires a pen and paper.
[07:55.44]And I'm gonna say this right now.
[07:58.98]I ain't speedrunning this game.
[08:00.52]I'm not going through this fast.
[08:01.90]I want to enjoy this because I've been waiting for like 20 years for this game to come out.
[08:06.59]So I might take a little while in some places.
[08:10.54]I might want to listen to songs and stuff like that.
[08:12.74]So if you're one of those people that's just like, get on with it and do the puzzle.
[08:18.42]What are you doing?
[08:21.24]You're probably going to want to just hang tight.
[08:25.09]Because this game is going to be like a chill.
[08:29.51]I'm just going to play and run.
[08:31.11]I got my little notepad here.
[08:32.19]I got to scribble some notes on it and stuff.
[08:34.91]You know how it is.
[08:39.98]So, how many people are here?
[08:42.24]Um, like, four, like, showed up.
[08:43.70]I think you can turn the volume up by maybe just, like, the in-game volume a little, little, you know?
[08:48.34]Like, 10% boost, and then, um... Alright, well, those are 10%.
[08:57.31]We're looking quite keen, you know?
[08:59.93]Oh, but you better not talk during any cutscenes.
[09:01.65]If you speak during a cutscene, I am just going to end.
[09:04.83]I'm gonna end the call.
[09:05.65]I'm just gonna get out of here.
[09:07.87]The only thing I'm gonna say during a cutscene...
[09:12.30]better not say anything alright mine yeah so here we go this is your answer yeah I got my pen I got my paper I got my coffee I got my little dog to the right we're gonna play on the crud so here we go
[10:33.48]We'll reach the final space, and heal us and survive.
[11:06.13]Okay, Beak Beak.
[11:07.99]I'm just glad we're still alive.
[11:10.67]Yeah, me too.
[11:12.84]Now, let's get a look at the hull.
[11:17.78]Yeah, this does not look good.
[11:19.66]I don't think our pod insurance is gonna cover this.
[11:22.84]Our deductible is nuts, too.
[11:25.75]Beak Beak, look at that.
[11:27.05]What do you make of this guy?
[11:28.63]Ooh, an arm.
[11:56.56]Nice work, little wing buddy.
[12:15.02]Hey, that's what I'm here for.
[12:20.50]Looks good enough for me.
[12:21.74]Let's go in.
[12:22.86]Hold on, hold on.
[12:23.56]We don't know what's inside.
[12:25.02]There could be Carpathian brain suckers.
[12:34.96]Here we are.
[12:35.65]Beaky, what is this place?
[12:38.53]Got me.
[12:39.03]I don't know.
[12:40.51]This looks too hard.
[12:41.93]I think I'd stop here.
[12:43.17]Actually, I'm going to do this because it probably would be a good idea.
[12:49.12]Let's turn on some subtitles.
[12:50.69]That'll probably help.
[12:52.81]Alright.
[12:53.21]So.
[12:54.21]So, this is me.
[13:00.03]This is Tommy Knot.
[13:00.75]This is a little dog.
[13:01.72]Okay, I can click on the dog and move the dog around.
[13:08.34]So, you control two characters in this game.
[13:10.62]Alright.
[13:11.42]Interesting.
[13:12.06]Well, let's go pick up this.
[13:20.14]Take a look outside.
[13:21.40]Yeah.
[13:21.86]I am a little louder than you, but you know.
[13:24.32]Man, whatever.
[13:25.58]I don't worry about it, man.
[13:29.45]What the hell was that?
[13:30.57]Alright.
[13:35.68]I gotta pay attention.
[13:37.75]Because these guys, the Neverhood guys, they put random weird clues that you'll need like four hours from now in these rooms.
[13:47.54]In these first rooms.
[13:48.24]If I remember from the last game, there's a lot of wacky shit.
[13:51.68]So...
[13:55.63]Let's take a look at some of the stuff over here.
[13:57.01]I mean, that was 20 years ago.
[13:59.53]Do you think you're going to need to know the information from 20 years ago?
[14:02.25]That would be cool if you did.
[14:03.65]I can't click on this.
[14:04.95]From the back of the box, the cell number?
[14:07.17]That looks like a dog hole, but, you know, okay.
[14:10.42]There's a spot here.
[14:11.82]There we go.
[14:15.74]Okay.
[14:17.74]Easy as pie.
[14:23.00]Get a load of that thing.
[14:25.95]This room is so cool.
[14:26.97]I apologize in advance.
[14:29.90]I'm gonna take in every single room.
[14:35.08]What is that?
[14:35.54]Is that a piece of cheese?
[14:36.42]It's like a fuzzy piece of cheese.
[14:39.06]Ah, I knew you'd come.
[14:46.50]You have traveled far, yet your true journey begins through the exit unseen.
[14:53.75]Okay.
[14:54.55]Anything else?
[14:55.01]Okay.
[14:56.73]Can I do anything over here?
[14:58.71]There's a spot up there, it looks like.
[15:00.59]Let's go touch this guy.
[15:25.28]That looks important.
[15:28.18]Light bulb up there.
[15:29.12]Can I jump?
[15:29.50]Can I touch it?
[15:32.12]No, I can't.
[15:32.56]I can go over it, can't I?
[15:33.66]Yeah, I can go down.
[15:37.10]Button press.
[15:39.29]Symbol.
[15:39.63]Write it down.
[15:40.85]Write this down.
[15:43.51]They don't put random symbols like this in the game.
[15:45.55]I'm telling you right now, guys.
[15:46.81]Get your notebooks ready.
[15:49.01]What would you call this room?
[15:50.31]Light bulb room, right?
[15:52.85]I would call it spaghetti.
[15:55.56]That's not that good.
[15:56.52]Why?
[15:56.76]No, you see the big spaghetti in the background?
[15:59.08]Tell me that's not some pasta wall.
[16:01.82]Kind of is.
[16:03.66]Yeah, now you see it my way.
[16:05.43]Okay, light bulb room.
[16:06.35]We're going to call this... I don't know, what would you call it?
[16:09.51]Like a Super Mario ship, right?
[16:13.11]Spaghetti room with a crouton.
[16:16.51]Alright.
[16:21.77]Well, the dog looks like he can fit down here.
[16:27.12]I'm going to put the light on.
[16:30.88]Whoa.
[16:35.22]Whoa, this is... Oh, God, this is trippy.
[16:43.37]What's that?
[16:45.35]What did I just eat?
[16:47.47]Shit, I should have paid attention.
[16:48.92]I just ate something.
[16:49.64]I don't know what the hell it was.
[16:52.66]I'm going to come out the doggy door, right?
[16:54.85]Yeah, press Ctrl-I.
[16:55.89]There's another symbol.
[16:57.39]Write this one down.
[16:58.13]There's another symbol.
[16:58.81]Hold on a second.
[17:03.63]It's a box.
[17:07.72]A little swirly in the middle.
[17:10.98]And then two squares next to it.
[17:17.41]Can you do anything else?
[17:19.61]Can I walk in?
[17:20.43]No, this door's closed.
[17:24.68]Jelly Roll, that's a good name for it.
[17:25.80]Yeah, Jelly Roll.
[17:27.08]It looks like the end of an armchair, if you ask me, dude.
[17:29.22]It kind of does.
[17:31.66]He's not tall enough to grab that, but... Okay, I got another symbol, though.
[17:37.30]So... That's good to know.
[17:42.22]Now, is this because the light is on?
[17:44.62]What if the light's off?
[17:47.43]Because I don't think I can switch back to Tommy Nod.
[17:51.99]What happens if I turn... Let's put the light on and try that again.
[17:55.20]What?
[17:57.12]Oh, he just puked up a lever.
[17:58.45]Oh, shit.
[18:02.43]Uh... I just ate it again.
[18:10.31]Where does the second lever go?
[18:15.20]Oh, no.
[18:15.76]Okay, there was a lever in this next room.
[18:17.78]Over here.
[18:19.78]I remember.
[18:20.46]I remember.
[18:22.92]There it is.
[18:30.13]That opens that door.
[18:32.51]That door I could not open before.
[18:34.85]I can push this fuzzy guy.
[18:36.35]I love this character, by the way.
[18:40.16]The fuzzy guy?
[18:40.96]Yeah.
[18:41.46]Whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck?
[18:42.42]The fuzzy guy has no emotions.
[18:47.70]He's just like... Do whatever you want with him.
[18:51.56]He's a sofa.
[18:52.16]Okay, I can go up.
[18:53.98]I'm leaving Beak Beak behind, though.
[18:57.88]Ooh, smells like bacon in here.
[19:03.95]I kind of feel like I need to click this.
[19:07.99]Greetings, friend.
[19:09.01]I am Abraham Lincoln.
[19:17.17]One, two.
[19:20.61]That was one, two, one, two, three, one.
[19:23.45]I've got to see that again.
[19:24.25]Hold on.
[19:25.75]Aunt Lincoln.
[19:30.85]Two, three, one.
[19:31.61]Okay, Ant Lincoln.
[19:37.74]Two, three, one.
[19:40.62]Was there anything else in there?
[19:41.42]What should I... One, two, three, four, five lines.
[19:49.81]I have no idea what this means.
[19:50.91]I'm sure maybe later I'll figure it out.
[19:57.07]What's the significance, you think, of him being the tallest American president?
[20:01.63]Quite the stature, even without the top hat over James Madison.
[20:08.57]James Madison, 5'4", really didn't stand up to anything Abraham Lincoln had accomplished.
[20:13.23]They say politicians have to be tall.
[20:16.64]I think you're going to have to be tall to do one of these puzzles.
[20:20.52]I don't think I'm tall enough to do this puzzle.
[20:25.64]This obviously correlates to
[20:27.63]The ant guy, so... I mean, I see a couple Pop-Tarts on that top row.
[20:33.35]You're scrolling by.
[20:40.18]Any of these symbols... The armchair was on the top row.
[20:43.50]Yeah, I thought it was too.
[20:46.36]But does that mean anything?
[20:51.03]This is the only world that's lit up.
[20:55.51]Well, can't you push them down?
[20:56.67]There's the ups and the downs.
[20:58.23]Yeah, I guess.
[20:58.81]Oh, yeah, I can.
[20:59.81]Okay, yeah, cool.
[21:02.42]Jesus Christ, what would you do without me?
[21:04.96]So let's try to make the... The jelly roll, right?
[21:12.68]What can I do?
[21:13.20]I don't think I even... Whoa, hold on.
[21:14.62]Are there any more swords, too?
[21:30.98]I'm going to come back to this in a second.
[21:34.08]I want to go down to... I want to look at this one more thing.
[21:39.58]Because I want to turn the light on and let him go down.
[21:44.93]Go down there.
[21:47.43]Can you not go down there?
[21:49.61]Whoa.
[21:50.55]Let's head back down.
[21:59.16]Oh, boy.
[22:00.80]Wow.
[22:02.88]Look at this.
[22:03.96]Look at this.
[22:04.44]I feel like this has something to do with it.
[22:08.84]Oh, does it?
[22:09.26]Yeah, it does, right?
[22:10.08]I mean, why wouldn't it?
[22:15.04]Oh, man.
[22:16.36]So this is obviously the top row, right?
[22:22.20]Okay, I'm going to come back to this room, but I do want to turn that light on.
[22:28.91]So, you go in there now that it's on, because there might be something else in here I didn't see.
[22:34.03]Can I hear your dog?
[22:36.06]Yes.
[22:37.30]I can hear it.
[22:38.76]Hold on a sec.
[22:40.40]Hey, what are you doing?
[22:41.88]It's very faint.
[22:43.78]Just had to point out, you had a real horn dog.
[22:48.54]Hey.
[22:48.80]Hey, don't.
[22:51.60]Hey, what are you doing?
[22:54.97]Stop it.
[22:55.83]Stop doing it.
[23:00.94]How did you have to point that out?
[23:03.42]You would only know what it was if you were listening for it.
[23:05.97]Okay, well obviously that's the same.
[23:10.75]So... Let's go back in this room.
[23:15.49]Can I?
[23:15.97]Or does the light have to be on?
[23:19.21]Alright.
[23:22.06]Oh no, please.
[23:25.00]I'm gonna lose my composure.
[23:32.25]Uh, so I should probably write some of these down.
[23:35.57]Let's make this circle here.
[23:39.14]Were these symbols even up there?
[23:43.46]I don't think so.
[23:46.02]Can I get a look at these?
[23:46.78]Let's see if this guy can tell me anything.
[23:52.56]In turn, you shall find two rooms in the round.
[23:56.22]Hmm.
[24:01.83]Interesting.
[24:03.77]I'm gonna go look and see if those symbols are up there.
[24:13.09]If these symbols are up there, then obviously that's the first, second, and third row.
[24:19.63]Aunt Lincoln does this again.
[24:21.07]I could just take pictures with my phone, you're right.
[24:32.05]Why does he take so long to do the third one?
[24:33.51]Okay, where are those?
[24:41.05]I'm not noticing any, really.
[24:47.47]It's like astronauts and...
[25:09.36]Maybe there's one picture in here that I can even make.
[25:11.75]Can you reset that thing to default?
[25:16.59]I wonder.
[25:17.99]Maybe it'll just go to default?
[25:20.35]No.
[25:23.97]I feel like there's just one picture in here that you can actually make.
[25:26.67]You know what I mean?
[25:35.05]Like, why would this line be here?
[25:38.21]It's obviously telling me that there's something has to be in these three lines, right?
[25:43.07]So what can be made?
[25:43.87]Did you try moving them each in the number of clicks that he did?
[25:49.30]Possibly, but I mean, there's gotta be one picture I can make here.
[26:04.28]Well, that's that guy's face downstairs.
[26:13.09]Yeah, the yellow button is to say, hey, I did it.
[26:20.91]Well, just for fun, let's do, it was two, three, one, right?
[26:26.78]Yeah.
[26:27.46]But that doesn't determine up or down.
[26:29.84]No.
[26:35.30]No, it's definitely a picture you have to make in this row.
[26:38.56]But what is the picture?
[26:44.13]I'll check Instagram.
[26:46.05]Check Instagram.
[26:51.56]Scales... Is there anything else I can click on here?
[27:03.13]No...
[27:18.43]Who's that?
[27:18.97]This guy with the glasses on.
[27:25.19]It has to involve the jelly roll, right?
[27:27.95]That's the thing that's been... Hold on.
[27:35.92]I want to go back to the first room.
[27:38.30]Because I don't think I pushed... I didn't push that thing all the way forward.
[27:44.78]Can I keep pushing this?
[27:45.60]I think I can, right?
[27:46.24]Yeah.
[27:46.55]I should be able to.
[27:49.94]No, I guess not.
[27:56.35]No.
[27:58.35]I guess not.
[28:04.07]Hmm.
[28:06.49]What about this?
[28:07.77]This is the only row that is full.
[28:15.46]In turn, you shall find two rooms in the round.
[28:23.37]Now that just opens the door.
[28:24.49]Yeah, I'm going to send the dog back in.
[28:34.24]Go in, go in.
[28:35.04]I think he actually used to be in the room.
[28:38.64]These symbols of this show have to mean something.
[29:03.37]Alright, look at that.
[29:05.57]Okay, alright, alright, alright, right, right, right.
[29:07.25]That jelly roll is in that spot.
[29:08.89]Look at it.
[29:09.25]One, two, three.
[29:10.43]Jelly roll absolutely goes in the left spot.
[29:13.71]Abso-positively, why would they have these three squares?
[29:17.80]So, if that's the first one, what determines the second and third slot?
[29:28.14]Is it the two things I wrote down?
[29:30.66]But were those even pictures?
[29:31.78]I don't remember.
[29:33.48]Let's go find out.
[29:39.62]But yeah, the Jelly Roll app is in the first spot.
[29:49.95]Let's just let it go back to that room.
[29:55.45]When do you get a gun?
[29:59.82]Hmm.
[30:00.62]I want to look at the symbols again that were on this thing.
[30:05.80]I love how this is a heart.
[30:10.78]It's like beating.
[30:15.10]Okay, let's get the jelly roll here.
[30:20.69]Where is the jelly roll?
[30:22.19]There it is.
[30:23.21]Alright.
[30:23.85]This has to be in this spot.
[30:25.69]I can't put this anywhere else.
[30:26.73]It has to be here.
[30:29.14]Now where is anything else?
[30:37.96]Is there a spike?
[30:48.07]That kind of looks like it, right?
[30:49.51]Not really, though.
[30:58.83]Can I?
[30:59.37]Maybe I can see.
[31:03.52]Oh, geez, Louise.
[31:06.70]You can fucking go higher.
[31:08.82]Whatever happened here, it was not good.
[31:12.72]Alright, well.
[31:14.84]We figured it out.
[31:15.66]We could go up a room.
[31:18.38]Look at this guy.
[31:19.88]Can you go any higher?
[31:21.54]Yes, there's even more.
[31:22.66]Alright, there's a whole lot going on here.
[31:24.25]Let's
[31:25.92]Holy shit, that's gross.
[31:28.00]Can I talk to this guy?
[31:29.22]Yeah, you're going to want to write that down, Jeremiah.
[31:32.42]And there are a lot of people saying they solved it already, even without knowing you could go up.
[31:36.26]It doesn't really do anything.
[31:41.37]Sure.
[31:41.61]Let's just walk over here.
[31:45.35]Okay, another piece to pick up.
[31:50.23]I should probably take this.
[31:55.39]Can I put anything in here?
[32:01.70]I guess I can't walk over here yet.
[32:05.68]Can the dog go over there?
[32:07.40]No.
[32:09.80]Alright, well I did get another lever.
[32:15.59]This looks very important.
[32:17.77]Look at that mess.
[32:18.81]I'm going to have to figure that out eventually.
[32:24.91]This room, I believe, is the important room.
[32:32.71]Anything I can do in here?
[32:35.57]Well, this is where the lever goes.
[32:43.43]Okay.
[32:50.01]There's two rooms in the room.
[32:52.42]I guess I had to just keep going.
[32:54.99]What about that?
[32:55.45]Can you do anything with that, dog?
[32:57.94]Yes, you can.
[32:59.10]Nice work, Beak Beak.
[33:05.26]This is a cool room.
[33:12.93]Oh, boy.
[33:15.21]I've seen these symbols, too.
[33:19.49]Yep.
[33:20.75]This square was on top of the octopus.
[33:25.27]I got to turn the machine on, though.
[33:28.43]Right?
[33:28.61]I think I do.
[33:34.17]It turns on a vacuum.
[33:35.07]He has to go up there.
[33:35.91]Do I have enough time to get there?
[33:44.07]I'm not sure.
[33:48.51]Write that down.
[33:50.15]Maybe I should write that part down.
[33:56.23]So one thing I have noticed is yes, these correspond to certain rooms.
[34:02.02]Write that down.
[34:02.50]I don't need to write it down yet.
[34:04.24]I just gotta remember.
[34:08.18]Can the dog come in?
[34:09.16]The dog can't come in here.
[34:10.84]No, write that down.
[34:15.84]Can I make it before this?
[34:16.76]No, I can't.
[34:19.42]Anything else in here that I need to... There's like a crystal floating up there.
[34:27.77]Remember we talked about the notebook?
[34:29.43]This is why you have the notebook.
[34:32.48]I'm going to go back to the other room.
[34:33.62]Let's figure out the first thing first because these things might not all be in the same order.
[34:40.38]Isn't there still another room to go into?
[34:45.61]So see here?
[34:46.71]I want to just remember this because look up here.
[34:50.17]That rectangle right here corresponds to the octopus.
[34:58.27]These three prongs.
[35:03.18]Was this game handmade?
[35:06.30]Yes, it was.
[35:07.82]This whole game is made out of clay and stuff and blocks and wood and all kinds of cool things.
[35:19.09]There's a button.
[35:19.57]Press the button.
[35:24.77]Maybe the dog has to press it.
[35:30.26]Can one of you press the button, please?
[35:39.24]Touch it.
[35:40.78]It's got a lightning bolt on it.
[35:41.80]I need to write that down.
[35:53.07]Lightning bolt over button.
[35:56.35]Their lightning bolt was also over the car.
[35:59.66]The top right.
[36:01.34]Oh.
[36:02.46]It was.
[36:02.88]I didn't even write that down.
[36:05.98]Maybe that's probably how you power the car.
[36:09.74]So, I guess you go.
[36:10.70]I'm going to put the dog in here, obviously.
[36:17.49]Another trippy, freaky-ass room.
[36:19.15]I feel like we're getting closer to solving the first Abraham Lincoln puzzle.
[36:29.96]What the hell?
[36:31.38]Ooh!
[36:32.94]There it is!
[36:33.82]There's the second symbol!
[36:35.10]There's the second symbol!
[36:40.12]I'd call that... I'd call that... Pac-Man's cousin eating a lightning bolt.
[36:54.96]Now, theoretically, here's like the theoretical, right?
[36:59.20]We could go do that, and then just wild guess on the third one and get it eventually.
[37:03.26]Uh, do you remember?
[37:04.96]Mm-hmm.
[37:06.22]That is actually Baby Carriage Constructed by Lightning.
[37:09.54]And I want to make sure you got that symbol right.
[37:18.91]No, it's Pac-Man's super cool sideburn brother.
[37:24.17]eating up lightning power-up in the new pac-man's cousin game it's a different power-up oh okay I see I haven't played that one yeah remember that though okay let's go back this is army Krog it's currently oh I just clicked out of the window whoops
[37:58.11]Let's see if we can actually finish that puzzle.
[38:05.05]Go back down.
[38:12.81]Pac-Man Elvis impersonator.
[38:14.31]Yeah, there you go.
[38:15.27]There it is.
[38:20.21]Okay, where is it?
[38:26.70]Hmm, this is not lined up correctly, is it?
[38:32.40]There's that one.
[38:33.44]Can I get the jelly back here, though?
[38:39.89]Where's the jelly?
[38:40.51]I gotta get it in the right spot.
[38:48.83]Oh, this is tough.
[38:50.54]This is like a puzzle within a puzzle.
[38:55.02]No.
[38:55.22]No.
[38:58.07]Is there only one?
[38:59.49]It must have to be like perfectly lined up.
[39:07.05]Where the hell is the jelly?
[39:17.20]There it is.
[39:17.64]Oh.
[39:20.04]Oh.
[39:21.26]Okay.
[39:22.02]I get it.
[39:22.36]Okay.
[39:23.76]Let's see if that's the one.
[39:25.26]No.
[39:35.01]I don't know what the last symbol is.
[39:35.99]There's no way to tell.
[39:38.87]You just have to spam it.
[39:41.11]See which is the last one.
[39:41.99]I just got it.
[39:43.69]Did you?
[39:44.50]No, I didn't.
[39:45.54]What?
[39:46.00]Oh, is it just... No, it's just different every time.
[39:48.86]I thought I had it.
[39:49.40]Alright, well, there's no way to determine that.
[39:52.14]Because I might have to move these around too.
[39:54.04]Like this.
[39:56.16]So... We need to find that last symbol.
[40:02.59]It's only like 50 other possibilities.
[40:12.20]One thing that's been a common factor here is the dog is the one that sees them.
[40:18.30]So... Did I miss an area where he can go?
[40:24.94]I don't think I did.
[40:28.92]Let's go back in here.
[40:29.60]Can I touch anything in this room?
[40:43.23]I don't think so.
[40:43.91]I feel like I should be able to press this button.
[40:56.19]For some reason I can't.
[40:57.01]I don't know.
[41:18.50]Whoa.
[41:22.11]Okay.
[41:23.51]That symbol is in this room.
[41:25.83]Star, pay attention.
[41:26.91]That symbol is in this room.
[41:28.55]Thanks, little buddy.
[41:32.11]Oh.
[41:34.29]That lowered it.
[41:36.33]I still can't operate this, though.
[41:42.80]Okay.
[41:43.92]Write that down.
[41:46.36]Yep.
[41:47.97]I'll write it down.
[41:54.61]It's down.
[41:57.23]Good.
[41:59.35]Let's go back.
[42:04.50]So for that to activate, that has to be there.
[42:06.34]So I can't do that puzzle until that room is in the right spot.
[42:19.45]That's different.
[42:25.68]Holy, what the fuck is this thing?
[42:29.92]I'm like scared to go in this room.
[42:31.12]I feel like he's gonna eat me.
[42:36.88]Oh boy.
[42:45.05]What was that?
[42:53.61]It's a... It's a baby.
[43:00.31]Can you imagine the wandering monsters this thing is attracting?
[43:03.87]I'm just saying.
[43:08.22]Tommy, Tommy, don't touch that thing.
[43:10.70]You don't know where it's been.
[43:14.18]Pee.
[43:14.48]Pee?
[43:23.83]Okay.
[43:28.06]There you go.
[43:29.18]Tommy not has you now.
[43:30.98]I'll take care of you until- Gonna have to strike that baby with lightning.
[43:34.04]I can figure out how to get you back to where you belong.
[43:42.23]So I hold on, I have- Did I just put the baby in my- Where did I just put that baby?
[43:49.21]Another lever.
[43:54.32]Weird look at this thing Something else has to be in this room.
[44:09.43]This is a weird pattern for the cracks Was that a symbol I don't remember I
[44:23.28]Well, just remember, it's a square with the... What can I do with that lever?
[44:32.18]Can't grab any of this stuff, can I?
[44:38.02]Crack's a weird pattern.
[44:38.82]Write that down.
[44:44.69]Yeah, that lever has to go somewhere.
[44:47.23]Let's find out where... I'm just going to remember that weird crack symbol looking thing.
[44:53.11]Oh, he's crying.
[44:55.75]Wait, what?
[44:59.17]I'm, like, pulling him off.
[45:01.45]Oh, boy.
[45:01.93]Um... Um... So I can't leave.
[45:18.22]Oh, shit.
[45:27.62]Did I get it?
[45:28.04]Oh, it's a song. ...
[46:08.39]it's not right that goes there right okay that's in the right spot so yeah these two just need to be flipped
[46:29.94]This is the one.
[46:32.65]Write that down.
[46:33.21]Write that song down.
[46:34.47]I didn't even need to write it down.
[46:38.69]You blow it.
[46:46.34]Oh, I can take the other ones off.
[46:49.78]Oh, I hope that doesn't mean I have to take off a bunch of these.
[47:06.06]So the back ones are the ones that are correct.
[47:07.70]Yeah.
[47:31.79]Just rip them all off.
[47:37.74]Alright, so it goes... Nope.
[47:41.46]No, it worked.
[47:41.92]I got it.
[47:44.44]He threw up a... So, there's one of these crystals.
[47:51.16]Pick it up, please.
[47:54.04]There was another crystal in the other room back here, but I got a lever.
[47:56.74]Right?
[48:01.51]Let's find where that lever needs to go.
[48:02.95]I think it's up here.
[48:15.20]Go back up there, Tommy.
[48:26.41]I can probably now use this after I press the button.
[48:29.99]Good thing Star was there to contribute and tell me what I needed to do.
[48:37.11]Pull it.
[48:39.53]Pull the lever.
[48:47.68]Huh.
[48:49.00]What the hell is he doing?
[48:50.92]Is he alright?
[48:51.76]He's just freaking out.
[48:53.82]So I have to power it on.
[48:56.04]But I couldn't press that button before.
[48:58.54]Maybe it was... Can he just go?
[49:01.01]No.
[49:03.71]There's no power here.
[49:04.71]The power needs to be turned on in this room.
[49:09.97]I am going to piss my pants, by the way.
[49:13.43]I gotta get this first area done.
[49:16.99]Before I piss my pants.
[49:19.63]It's really important.
[49:22.07]Now we gotta turn the room.
[49:23.75]Back to where it was.
[49:28.47]Now what if... What if... This means that there's power.
[49:34.90]When I turn it to the right spot.
[49:41.62]You know what I mean?
[49:42.38]I mean, I know I have to turn the power on, but that light turned on.
[49:54.27]Is there some connection that has to be made to this button?
[50:05.96]I'm just going to say that I'm going to try that.
[50:08.59]I'm going to turn this so the light turns on because then that means there's power.
[50:14.87]In regards to the power, it probably has something to do with the green Nickelodeon sludge in the pipes and the room below that is the room you can't get into.
[50:23.99]Maybe.
[50:24.29]I want to try this first.
[50:25.80]That's my vibe I'm getting.
[50:27.08]I just want to see because the light is on now.
[50:30.16]I wonder if that does anything.
[50:34.52]Okay, Jerma.
[50:36.60]Whatever you say, boss.
[50:39.94]Okay.
[50:45.62]The dial upstairs can be used.
[50:57.72]Just turning this... Hold on.
[51:15.08]Alright, so that turns... Remember where that is, so let's see what happens if I spin stuff.
[51:23.69]Wow, spin to win.
[51:26.41]Because there are things all over this.
[51:35.88]Alright, yeah.
[51:36.56]So that's changing.
[51:44.14]Do it again.
[51:46.65]This isn't a speed room.
[51:53.93]Woah, that was kind of... that was buggy.
[52:01.73]One more time, maybe?
[52:08.54]Uh, I gotta quit.
[52:09.42]Have you been writing these things down, Star?
[52:11.76]I have written everything down that has happened.
[52:13.68]I am the cartographer.
[52:15.52]Good.
[52:20.37]What's the quiz?
[52:23.31]The quiz is... Just that there was no quiz?
[52:26.13]Is it going to be on the test?
[52:34.86]You know, it might just be... Can I just not press the button?
[52:37.40]I feel like it's going to be lined up when that room is connected.
[52:42.50]I really do.
[52:43.33]I feel like when that room is connected to the one with the button in it, it'll be lined up, but I can't press the button.
[52:49.11]I hope that's not a bug.
[52:51.66]I hope that isn't a bug.
[52:54.88]You can hear what I said, you moron.
[52:58.28]Too busy paying attention to the video game.
[53:01.50]Go look in the power room again.
[53:03.53]You're going to agree with me once you see it.
[53:04.87]You're talking about the green slime?
[53:08.17]Yeah, the Nickelodeon goo.
[53:09.71]Yeah.
[53:10.95]You need to amp up that goo way before you can power it.
[53:13.17]Don't you know how these things work?
[53:15.61]I don't know, but I want to just get this in the right spot.
[53:17.47]I want to see...
[53:21.40]Never going to do it, dude.
[53:25.36]Shit.
[53:27.65]Can those even line up?
[53:28.65]I feel like... Alright, let's see.
[53:37.34]It's probably going to be lined up.
[53:38.50]You would think, right?
[53:42.54]No, it isn't.
[53:47.94]I don't even feel like I should be worried about this right now.
[53:52.66]No, but I just wanted to make sure.
[53:53.78]I wanted to get it in the right spot.
[53:54.94]The power.
[53:55.62]So you're saying in this room you're talking about in here, right?
[53:59.20]Like this green goo shit.
[54:01.80]Yeah.
[54:02.54]It's very low.
[54:03.66]And the room below that, where you'd imagine the green goo is coming from, you can't get into yet.
[54:08.40]So I'd leave this until you figure that out.
[54:12.92]I just wish I could press the button.
[54:15.78]I just love pressing buttons.
[54:17.22]I know, I do.
[54:25.58]Every time I press a button, I write it down.
[54:30.33]Yeah, the squiggles are aligned now.
[54:34.15]Right?
[54:35.61]No.
[54:39.11]Do whatever.
[54:39.41]I'm going to buy the game and erase you.
[54:40.73]Erase me.
[54:47.56]There was other one I didn't do.
[54:48.72]Hold on.
[54:49.37]I want to do this.
[54:57.31]It's a lot of trial and error to see if this works.
[55:02.38]I did skip one, although.
[55:05.96]You're getting the error part down, right?
[55:10.85]What is underneath?
[55:11.43]Let's go look under there.
[55:16.74]Yeah, because I can't get in this room.
[55:20.76]Man, I wish I could just, like, accidentally get this.
[55:26.62]And let's wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait just a second.
[55:32.91]No, like, maybe this is like a goo symbol, right?
[55:36.25]Maybe it's like a green goo symbol.
[55:38.77]The third most important symbol has been that lightning bolt.
[55:41.61]Is there a lightning bolt symbol?
[55:42.83]Let's find out.
[55:44.23]That's true.
[55:45.33]The lightning bolt is on the baby carriage, so maybe not.
[55:58.10]Is there a baby?
[55:59.14]Maybe that's a baby.
[55:59.80]Hmm.
[56:19.39]This kind of looks like a baby.
[56:21.77]No.
[56:28.83]Alright, well, I think we can sit here and wild guess as much as we want.
[56:33.56]But that's not going to work.
[56:38.38]So I can't get in this room.
[56:39.18]I have to get in this room to figure out the power.
[56:40.76]So maybe we go down.
[56:42.96]Can I touch this?
[56:43.75]Can I do anything here?
[56:45.47]Greetings, friend.
[56:47.23]I am Abraham Lincoln.
[57:03.54]Let's take a look at the... Nothing in the middle row really speaks to me.
[57:16.94]Try it, though.
[57:18.08]Why not?
[57:21.42]Got it.
[57:23.74]Got it.
[57:28.31]Oh, boy.
[57:29.33]This is not... What did that do?
[57:35.79]Oh, Jesus.
[57:38.65]Are you serious?
[57:41.65]I gotta, like, freeze the room?
[57:44.51]I gotta line this up?
[58:01.92]Let's go all the way to the left.
[58:03.30]You can only go a certain amount of ways, right?
[58:19.81]What does that mean?
[58:31.33]Slow down, slow down.
[58:42.57]Oh, okay, so one, two, two.
[58:45.09]I guess I have to make it hit it twice?
[58:46.25]Because there needs to be two in the middle.
[58:49.21]Yeah, I think that's what you have to do.
[58:55.44]shit no it's doing okay see what it's doing it's doing each part oh yeah man dude come on man I really didn't think about this one let's see so it's got to go over here it's like it's a safe it's a lock let's try this let's get this one
[59:24.43]So that one is not frozen.
[59:25.45]Let's see.
[59:27.79]That one will start to move.
[59:28.81]I'm assuming this is the answer, right?
[59:40.42]Let's try and do that again.
[59:43.06]Let me go to the right.
[59:54.19]I'm going to assume this is correct.
[60:02.61]There it is.
[60:05.69]Alright, so there's the line.
[60:06.91]I should be able to press the button now.
[60:10.13]Should I pull this?
[60:11.25]No.
[60:13.33]I'm scared to pull that.
[60:14.09]I don't want to reset it.
[60:18.56]So let's go back up.
[60:25.91]Now, go back in this room.
[60:29.79]I wonder if we have a thing I can do.
[60:32.43]If I can press the button.
[60:44.12]One more.
[60:46.98]We all doubted him.
[60:47.84]He's a genius.
[60:49.58]No, not really.
[61:02.90]Well, shit.
[61:16.99]Chairman didn't solve it the way that I wanted.
[61:21.31]This is connected now.
[61:25.00]So now I'm... Okay, now there should be power to it.
[61:29.50]If I get to the power side.
[61:30.64]Alright.
[61:36.06]I'm gonna go up there first.
[61:37.16]Just to make sure.
[61:42.18]I don't wanna spin the... I can't press that button.
[61:47.14]I love this song, by the way.
[61:48.20]I wanna listen to it for a second.
[62:05.88]Circuit is complete.
[62:13.29]Shit!
[62:17.37]There's one of the tubes.
[62:33.77]Now the real question is, is this going to be lined up if the power turns on here?
[62:41.84]So now, okay, we got power.
[62:45.00]I wonder if this is going to be out of alignment now.
[62:49.90]No, it's still in alignment.
[62:55.06]But I don't think there's any power.
[62:59.07]No, there's not.
[62:59.99]Gotta hit that button!
[63:02.64]I have to activate that button.
[63:16.01]I gotta suck up the dog in that vacuum.
[63:18.09]I'm gonna go back down here.
[63:30.26]Just wanna look in here one more time.
[63:35.56]No, I don't want to change that.
[63:53.61]What does he have to say?
[63:54.27]Anything?
[63:55.69]Nothing!
[63:56.17]Who is this, by the way?
[63:58.59]Is that, like, Noah?
[64:07.23]I don't think there's anything I can do in here.
[64:18.26]I'm going to go to the vacuum room.
[64:25.37]I'm definitely going to pee, though.
[64:29.27]I'll let you guys enjoy this while I go pee.
[64:32.29]I'll be back in like two minutes.
[64:33.93]Quick bathroom break.
[64:34.87]I'm going to go over this in my head.
[64:37.29]What the hell is that?
[64:41.01]Somebody was just making a bunch of fart noises.
[64:42.93]I'll be right back.
[64:44.25]I'm going to just pee.
[64:45.39]Here's my professional hold on screen.
[64:51.52]I'll be right back.
[64:58.08]Star, tell them a funny story.
[64:59.54]I don't want to be your funny story guy.
[65:02.42]Here's a funny story.
[65:04.68]Once upon a time... Jerma played... Jerma Krog... He was, um... He was, uh... Um... Once upon a time... Um...
[65:31.55]I haven't been writing down any jokes.
[65:35.74]I really haven't been paying that much attention.
[65:38.52]It's really hard to follow what's been going on on screen because he's saying everything like 15 seconds ahead of me seeing it.
[65:48.10]You know, typical streamer boy stuff.
[66:11.13]Yeah, stream was really dead without you.
[66:12.95]Where are you, dude?
[66:15.26]Thought I heard a door.
[66:16.00]I heard a door.
[66:18.53]Maybe that was a door in real life.
[66:48.28]Just sitting here at the Elmo screen.
[67:07.27]Just hanging out.
[67:21.66]Okay.
[67:23.53]I hope the story was good.
[67:25.11]It was good.
[67:26.21]I think people are still laughing about it.
[67:27.93]It was awesome.
[67:32.91]It was awesome.
[67:35.31]Okay, let me go over a couple things in my brain here.
[67:37.99]So I have a crystal.
[67:39.85]I have the power turned on.
[67:46.91]Where was the power room?
[67:49.01]Which one actually had the power in it?
[67:51.49]Well, the crystal thing, not this one.
[67:53.43]Oh, now this dream is boring again.
[67:54.75]That dream is back.
[67:55.45]There we go.
[67:58.53]You know what you can do.
[68:02.85]Suck an egg.
[68:03.43]Hey, you can suck an egg.
[68:10.59]Okay, what a weird insult that is, by the way.
[68:12.98]Oh, thanks, little buddy.
[68:14.00]That's pretty weird.
[68:26.19]Can this be activated now?
[68:30.75]Okay, so maybe if I put... Can I put something up here?
[68:34.97]I feel like the dog has to be in here with me.
[68:36.87]Can I weigh that down?
[68:37.77]Maybe I can... Can I put the baby on the green thing?
[68:40.84]Baby tube.
[68:41.90]Baby tube.
[68:43.02]Baby tube.
[68:44.12]Baby tube.
[68:47.76]Obviously the dog... The dog has to go up there.
[68:51.06]But how do I get... I might have to actually put the baby on that.
[68:56.75]Kill the baby.
[68:58.13]Kill the baby.
[68:59.19]Because this doesn't really seem to do anything yet, at least.
[69:13.72]You know that baby vomited?
[69:15.00]Like it threw up and gave you that green crystal?
[69:18.60]And then you stuck its vomit back in your stomach with it.
[69:24.14]So?
[69:28.53]I can't go on here.
[69:35.78]Can't interact with that.
[69:41.36]Alright.
[69:42.92]Let's go over a couple of things.
[69:46.71]I have a crystal.
[69:48.79]I need to turn the power on so I can use the roller coaster.
[70:03.93]And then there's the vacuum there that you suck the dog up and the dog ends up up here.
[70:17.19]I'm assuming, right?
[70:19.11]He comes out of one of these tubes.
[70:27.79]Whatever.
[70:34.13]I can't really keep him there either.
[70:40.40]I'm gonna go back in this room.
[70:50.56]This is the green room.
[70:51.56]There's nothing else in there besides the dog.
[71:16.94]One, two, three.
[71:17.80]Let's go up.
[71:22.47]He goes in here and he comes out the other side.
[71:23.99]I just want to look at this again.
[71:37.45]Can he go anywhere?
[71:38.49]I don't think he can go anywhere else.
[71:47.77]Alright.
[72:00.31]He can't do this either.
[72:09.02]And click every single inch of this.
[72:18.52]Because that is right in his wheelhouse.
[72:20.69]He's like ready to press this button.
[72:24.91]Look at how ready he is just to put his face into this button.
[72:41.86]At least you should be able just to press it, right?
[72:44.22]Even if it doesn't do anything.
[72:51.22]Maybe it's just an indicator.
[72:55.56]Otto, what are you doing?
[72:56.10]I'm going to go down.
[73:10.01]I'm going to look at the orange thing.
[73:17.19]This can't be interacted with.
[73:26.78]These don't mean anything yet.
[73:34.10]Oh, hold on.
[73:36.24]Hold on a second.
[73:37.40]Hold on.
[73:41.56]Wait a second.
[73:42.66]That's the same type of button that's up there.
[73:45.69]I swear, if me just turning the power off down here means the power upstairs can be turned on.
[73:52.35]That'd be crazy if that's what this was.
[73:56.54]That is a very Neverhood thing.
[73:58.90]If that's what the problem is.
[74:01.48]Like, oh, you gotta use the power upstairs.
[74:10.42]I guess not.
[74:13.06]Should've wrote that down.
[74:25.23]Does the octopus talk?
[74:28.39]No, he doesn't.
[74:34.51]Hmm.
[74:35.05]I wish there was a way to keep him here.
[74:41.02]I wonder if you can make him, like, stay.
[74:47.96]Huh.
[74:57.98]I'm trying to think about what hasn't been done.
[75:09.43]The only thing I can think of is trying to get into the crystal room, but that power's not, like, on.
[75:16.58]Maybe the power has to be on here, and then I can put the dog on here and then go in and do that?
[75:21.06]I'll try that.
[75:22.60]Maybe this works.
[75:27.18]See what that does.
[75:27.88]Nice work, Beak Beak.
[75:29.22]You know what I mean?
[75:32.71]Like, now is this turned on?
[75:33.67]No.
[76:34.03]Fucking stumped.
[76:35.66]I'm stumped!
[76:49.57]Let's take the dog back through here.
[76:57.35]Try to have the dog talk to the octopus in the weird... You know what?
[77:00.92]That's a good idea.
[77:02.80]That's a very good idea.
[77:03.90]I'm going to do that.
[77:09.46]Maybe he'll tell me something like, You need to turn the power on.
[77:12.42]Press the button.
[77:14.14]That's not the right room.
[77:14.70]Whoops.
[77:19.01]I hope that works, because otherwise I'm not entirely sure what else to do.
[77:27.83]Any thoughts, Star?
[77:29.99]Oh, I don't know.
[77:30.65]People tell me I'm a loud sniper.
[77:32.07]I forgot that people could even hear.
[77:34.24]I've just been spacing out.
[77:35.88]Yeah, you have.
[77:36.38]You've been totally spaced out.
[77:38.22]Oh, fuck.
[77:39.04]No, I wanted to click on... Damn it, come on.
[77:40.80]Can I hold this?
[77:42.14]No.
[77:42.96]Yes, I can.
[77:44.60]I didn't want to click on that again.
[77:46.46]Have you hit the baby with lightning yet?
[77:49.53]No.
[77:50.71]I have not.
[77:51.49]You can't do that.
[77:58.07]Yeah, I mean, this is a game by the guys that made The Neverhood, so it's very, very much you have to remember a lot of things.
[78:06.80]I'm in it for the long haul, though.
[78:09.88]It might take me a little while, but I'm in it for the long haul.
[78:12.61]I'll be back in three weeks.
[78:14.54]Yeah, I'll see you in like six months.
[78:16.42]You're just turning this lever like, what do I do?
[78:22.01]Alright.
[78:22.67]Please let me talk to the octopus as the dog in the secret world.
[78:30.34]That's an MMO.
[78:34.80]Here we go.
[78:35.80]Hey, you.
[78:37.56]Oh, it worked!
[78:54.01]I don't speak this language!
[78:55.81]Can't write this all down!
[79:19.53]Gaeula Nushef, Nisdien Raziva, Anukkot Darajafdal, Ekhatarap Nuzoreth, Rerug, Naeg, Saltnemdien Ratlifo, Masre Dab, Darinethetem et Tensitras, Araya, Nujal, Ilus, and Anukkot, and Acherb, and Alei, say Asankhid.
[79:38.94]Erdath, and Erdem, Sipikath, Moksole, and Sadase, Daribastet, say Asi, Adrak, and Enel.
[79:48.07]It's a great honor for me to be able to speak with you today.
[79:52.67]I'm very happy to be able to speak with you today.
[79:55.39]I'm very happy to be able to speak with you today.
[79:58.91]I'm very happy to be able to speak with you today.
[80:09.71]So these people were all killed.
[80:40.94]Alright, well, I got a thing.
[80:44.44]Did you get all that?
[80:49.02]I have a transcript if you want to go back.
[80:51.68]I'd like to hear the transcript.
[80:52.56]What is it?
[80:54.93]That was the first part.
[81:01.57]Just in case, I'm going to see if... Why do I feel like this game would be trivial and really easy if you spoke galactic space octopus?
[81:10.70]I picked up the thing, right?
[81:13.20]Yeah, what if that entire thing just told you every single puzzle?
[81:15.52]It sounded like it was telling you at least two or three of them.
[81:19.24]I think it probably was.
[81:21.49]At least at the beginning, it was like, okay, you use this one, this one, you go here, and you're going to need that.
[81:26.05]Oh, he puked.
[81:32.75]I think my audio may have gotten screwed up.
[81:38.14]Yeah, the game's not making any more, like, sounds.
[81:42.74]Wow.
[81:43.14]Quiet world, dude.
[81:44.63]Let me save it and restart it.
[81:46.35]I think that's, uh... Yeah.
[81:47.65]Go find a Koopa.
[81:48.51]Okay, hold on.
[81:50.57]Yeah, I've lost audio.
[81:53.15]We ran into a bug.
[81:54.29]There's a bug.
[81:55.15]After that cutscene, sometimes maybe you lose all audio.
[82:00.92]Uh, save the game.
[82:01.88]Um...
[82:08.57]Audio.
[82:14.27]No, it sounds back now.
[82:18.25]Is it just not in some places?
[82:22.56]Yeah, it killed the audio in random places.
[82:27.50]That's where that fits.
[82:30.42]Now I can probably press the button.
[82:31.42]Yeah, I want to... Hold on a second.
[82:37.28]Hold on just one second.
[82:39.94]Should lower my volume too a little bit.
[82:45.96]I kind of can't because you're coming through the same line as the game.
[82:49.22]Can't you lower Skype's volume in Windows?
[82:52.06]I've done that.
[82:53.18]That is what I have done.
[82:54.48]Do it a little more.
[82:57.84]It's like... Shut up.
[83:02.28]Shut him up.
[83:02.72]Shut him up.
[83:03.14]Shut him up.
[83:04.49]Oh my god.
[83:06.28]Really, why did you draw Elmo on this screen?
[83:08.78]That's not Elmo.
[83:10.02]Who is it?
[83:11.91]Is that you?
[83:12.57]Is that supposed to be you?
[83:13.53]You're not that handsome.
[83:15.35]I am that handsome.
[83:17.31]I am that handsome with my funny eyes and funny nose and big mouth.
[83:25.04]It's kind of a llama mouth.
[83:28.29]I've turned you down to like 10 and in the mixer I don't know if it's gonna help should have done zero zero alright let me reload the game let's hope we hey look at that we got audio again
[83:53.66]When is the Twitch event a way that if people clap or laugh, you can hear the laugh track.
[83:58.78]You can hear everyone's laughs.
[84:00.60]But if they say words, you can't get them through.
[84:03.27]It's only claps and laughs.
[84:07.71]Now I can press the button.
[84:08.75]See, I couldn't... There we are.
[84:10.03]Alright.
[84:17.37]We did it.
[84:19.65]I didn't do anything.
[84:21.37]That's really cool looking.
[84:27.11]That's so cool.
[84:29.61]Now I can use the thing and fly around on the go-kart.
[84:46.34]Ahaha!
[84:50.36]Oh!
[84:51.50]Wait a minute.
[84:52.00]There we go.
[84:52.42]We're both... Okay, we're both in here.
[84:58.49]Let's move!
[85:06.92]I remember this was in the Neverhood.
[85:18.94]This is so cool.
[85:20.77]Weeeee!
[85:26.39]Looks like there's a little spot to go in.
[85:28.13]Hey look, remember that thing that I already got?
[85:34.21]I already guessed it.
[85:43.76]So that's a... I like was a step ahead.
[85:46.00]There's a way to go that way though.
[85:53.00]How do I get up there?
[85:57.90]Well, we're gonna go all the way around.
[86:01.70]Weehee.
[86:04.46]Hopefully this weird octopus lady doesn't say anything strange to me.
[86:08.53]She's gonna go like, I'm gonna go, I don't know what the hell that means.
[86:19.67]Let's keep going.
[86:24.83]Haaah.
[86:32.19]No.
[86:33.07]Do it again.
[86:35.51]I'm gonna go down first.
[86:36.99]Just in case there's something down here.
[86:40.49]Shit.
[86:41.81]Never mind, gotta go up.
[86:49.91]Go on.
[86:55.71]Those are symbols from...
[87:01.98]These... I remember the bush.
[87:08.02]Let's speed through this.
[87:09.18]Can I go down, maybe?
[87:10.18]I wonder.
[87:10.48]No.
[87:12.26]I've got to keep going to the right.
[87:18.70]New area.
[87:19.22]Because that's how you go in here, so we're not going to do that yet.
[87:38.10]uh well here we go I obviously have to put this down there okay this is gonna take me a minute I only have one going at a time
[88:08.64]Only one can fit in at a time.
[88:09.82]You definitely have to clear out the bottom.
[88:21.25]This one's going to be tough.
[88:29.88]I got to get them all over in one side, I think.
[88:34.18]For instance, this has got to go...
[88:38.35]All down here first, maybe.
[88:45.89]Shit!
[88:51.51]All three of those can go up here now, right?
[89:03.40]Where's the bottom?
[89:04.18]Bottom's over there.
[89:04.86]Let's get the bottom out.
[89:21.45]Get the bottom out first.
[89:23.89]You are not good at this.
[89:24.95]What are you talking about?
[89:29.39]I'm having some trouble, dude.
[89:33.65]I'm just watching you.
[89:34.55]You're having trouble.
[89:35.45]Hey, you're the one having the trouble.
[89:41.88]Oh, shit.
[89:42.30]I think actually I can move this over here.
[89:49.50]Want to talk about it, Jerma?
[89:53.12]I did kind of screw myself with that.
[89:59.07]Actually, no, not really.
[89:59.73]Now I can just do that.
[90:01.67]I bet if you used the baby, you could just skip this.
[90:04.93]Maybe.
[90:06.83]Maybe baby.
[90:09.29]Complete.
[90:09.69]Hey, you having some trouble, Star?
[90:14.58]Me?
[90:15.56]No, I did it.
[90:16.70]Why would I be having trouble?
[90:18.66]I don't know.
[90:20.73]Is there a troublesome person?
[90:21.65]Another one of these octopus people.
[90:24.72]Is that a dog food bowl?
[90:29.70]It's a dog bowl.
[90:30.64]Eat out of that dog bowl.
[90:31.96]I command you.
[90:39.92]Up here, that looks like a haunted house.
[90:50.03]grass coming out over here.
[90:51.22]I'm assuming something's going to come out of there and land and he's going to eat it.
[90:58.56]I just want to take a look at the rooms.
[91:07.97]Hmm.
[91:17.26]Interesting.
[91:20.59]Doesn't seem to be doing anything at the moment.
[91:22.07]Maybe I have to turn it on.
[91:31.60]Can you grab that, dude?
[91:32.32]What are you doing?
[91:43.40]You don't want to pull the lever?
[91:44.90]Is there a reason why you don't want to do that?
[91:53.48]Okay.
[91:55.84]Okay.
[91:56.90]Let's see what's in this room.
[92:00.31]Here's this guy again.
[92:03.53]Okay.
[92:09.76]Inspire others to great heights and your objectives shall be reached.
[92:22.64]He didn't say it again.
[92:24.72]Holy shit.
[92:31.91]You wanna read a whole book?
[92:36.66]Oh man, this is a long... This is lore.
[92:43.89]This is a lot of lore.
[92:50.46]What if I had to read this whole thing to figure out a certain puzzle?
[92:52.72]I probably will.
[92:54.94]Knowing these guys, I probably will have to read this whole thing.
[93:00.44]Well, we'll find out if I need to or not.
[93:03.30]Write it down.
[93:03.86]I'm going to write that down.
[93:05.40]Write down that entire script.
[93:11.42]Well, might as well have him stand on that and see what happens.
[93:16.42]Maybe I can just stand on it.
[93:31.74]Turns the lights off.
[93:34.47]I'm just gonna keep him there.
[93:35.33]Maybe he can stay there.
[93:42.53]Alright.
[93:42.87]Can I probably level her now?
[93:56.76]Jesus.
[94:03.02]I'm not even sure where to start here.
[94:12.39]Is there some color coding?
[94:16.17]That needs to be thought of here.
[94:17.47]Let's go from room to room to see.
[94:33.34]Well, these are symbols.
[94:34.64]I don't know if these mean anything, but they probably do.
[94:41.88]And they're wearing things, too.
[94:52.16]Each astronaut has to be the right... Let's pull this again.
[94:54.73]Just want to see what happens.
[94:57.43]Kind of scrambled it a little bit.
[95:05.39]I'm going to go outside here because I haven't been out here since it's been dark.
[95:08.89]I guess it doesn't really affect out here that much.
[95:19.48]I'm going to turn the lights back on because they had badges.
[95:30.57]Turn the lights back on.
[95:41.80]Okay, big peek.
[95:45.32]Green.
[95:46.82]Guess what, guys?
[95:48.14]Hey, guess what?
[95:49.96]Write it down.
[95:51.76]Green, red, purple, blue, yellow, or orange-ish.
[96:06.13]Line those up.
[96:08.90]Somehow, by using your skills of deduction... Still don't know what this does.
[96:22.06]Star, are you going to contribute or what?
[96:27.73]I don't think he's even here.
[96:30.85]I don't think he's here.
[96:36.31]Let's just see what happens here.
[96:47.00]Wait a second.
[96:50.48]I'm muted.
[96:50.92]I'm just watching.
[96:52.20]Is it combining the colors?
[96:53.50]I think it's combining them to make these colors.
[96:55.52]Let's see.
[97:02.43]This is correct.
[97:06.53]Bye.
[97:07.71]Are you leaving?
[97:09.35]I'm watching.
[97:10.49]If I see something and you're too stupid, I'm going to go tell Ash.
[97:15.66]green okay got that one look hey you haven't you haven't like even all you told me to do was like strike the baby with lightning what is that oh good advice that was that was cool that was great advice these are color coded and in some way you're going to have to line them up uh what do you think I'm doing what do you want me to tell you
[97:37.21]I don't know you.
[97:38.69]I did it.
[97:39.39]I already did it.
[97:40.25]Didn't even need Star's help.
[97:42.43]You know what?
[97:43.61]Get out of here.
[97:44.49]You know what?
[97:45.03]Get out of here.
[97:46.79]Get out.
[97:47.85]Can I have you listen for a second?
[97:48.99]I have a story I want to tell everyone.
[97:50.09]Alright, go.
[97:52.95]So... I didn't think you were going to get by.
[97:58.36]I'm waiting for a story.
[98:02.38]No, I didn't think you were going to let me.
[98:04.66]I'm waiting for a story.
[98:06.80]If you want a story, read the one on the wall.
[98:16.81]Go, do it.
[98:17.57]Everyone wants to hear it.
[98:21.15]No, it's a lot.
[98:22.55]It's a long, long... You're not going to want to talk again after you do it.
[98:31.45]Another one of these guys Hold on, we got a great song, hold on I need to listen to this It's got an accordion This music is so great
[98:59.61]Terry Scott Taylor, you are a genius.
[99:01.33]I'm going to push this in the other room.
[99:14.14]Can I look out here?
[99:17.46]I can't look out the window.
[99:18.38]I want to get down.
[99:21.32]I want to get down.
[99:26.43]Maybe I can't push him.
[99:28.01]I'd like to go down here.
[99:31.23]No, I guess not.
[99:32.01]Whatever.
[99:35.49]Oh, yeah, here's the... Yeah, I can't even push him.
[99:40.30]I really want... Yeah, somebody's saying I want one of these.
[99:42.22]It'd be cool just to have one of these as, like, a toy.
[99:45.12]Just so I got, like, something to put on your desk.
[99:47.92]Like a paperweight.
[99:49.36]That'd be cool.
[99:51.95]So what did that... I got a lever.
[99:55.09]Is there a lever in the first room?
[100:04.81]That allowed me to get the lever to put into something here.
[100:11.48]Maybe.
[100:15.88]No.
[100:17.60]No.
[100:17.80]I just want to make sure there's nothing out here that I missed.
[100:21.96]Nope.
[100:23.48]Besides the weird birds.
[100:28.48]I actually am going to write this down.
[100:31.46]See this octopus?
[100:33.36]This purple octopus has this symbol.
[100:36.10]So we're going to say P-Octo.
[100:41.31]I'm going to draw that.
[100:43.01]P-Octo.
[100:45.37]This first symbol.
[100:50.03]And the other one was like orange, right?
[100:52.64]It was an orange Octo.
[100:55.06]He had orange lips.
[100:56.60]And he had the rectangle.
[100:57.86]Oh, Octo.
[101:00.30]Had the rectangle.
[101:06.06]Okay, let's go down.
[101:06.90]Let me just make sure I can't go any further.
[101:16.73]I can.
[101:17.19]There is another area.
[101:21.10]Another power symbol.
[101:24.20]Let's start at the bottom.
[101:25.44]And there's a lever.
[101:28.62]What?
[101:30.86]What?
[101:32.32]The lever doesn't go here?
[101:33.12]Are you kidding me?
[101:39.28]Are you kidding me?
[101:39.88]The lever doesn't go there?
[101:40.66]Well, this is... I can't do anything in here right now, so we're going to go back up.
[101:48.22]I need another lever.
[101:49.90]Write that down.
[101:58.69]You're progressing too far.
[101:59.81]Yeah, I... There were things I didn't do in the other room, but that's... You got backtracking, man.
[102:03.57]You gotta go backwards at some point.
[102:08.77]This is so cool.
[102:09.55]Look at this bird shit.
[102:11.91]That's so... This is definitely... I love stuff like this, man.
[102:15.57]Like, they... This is probably real bird shit.
[102:20.47]Right?
[102:22.33]That's a place for a lever.
[102:25.29]Whoa.
[102:25.73]Whoa.
[102:43.07]that was cool that was really cool it just stretched out the accordion room hey I remember this we wrote it down and what was it to a fuck already going on 231 but oh
[103:18.50]It's got to be the right color, too.
[103:24.92]It's got to be the right colors.
[103:27.16]Okay.
[103:33.97]I actually don't know.
[103:36.03]This has been shown up a couple times, I think.
[103:40.21]Well, we can't do this one yet.
[103:41.09]I need to know what the colors are.
[103:42.07]Can I do anything with these birds?
[103:47.89]Let me save it.
[103:48.44]I want to make sure I save the game.
[103:50.16]Often.
[103:51.08]There is an auto-save, but... You know, just in case.
[103:55.28]You never know.
[103:56.70]Could run into, like, a crash.
[104:02.42]The colors.
[104:03.73]Actually, you know what?
[104:06.73]I'm going to write the symbols down, too.
[104:09.81]Because that would make sense, right?
[104:12.19]The colors.
[104:13.41]My notebook is all screwed up.
[104:15.19]I got scribbles everywhere.
[104:16.43]This is not right.
[104:18.85]This is just... Not right at all.
[104:23.33]This is just incorrect.
[104:28.31]Squirrely symbol with the crown.
[104:35.73]Then we got giant mustache.
[104:42.40]And then we got the shoe.
[104:45.40]That looks like a shoe, kind of.
[104:50.36]Like a Yoshi foot.
[104:56.68]Okay.
[104:57.82]Let's go back.
[105:01.36]Everything in here might have changed as well.
[105:04.70]It did.
[105:06.70]Look at the color.
[105:14.44]Dude.
[105:16.98]Here's another power machine.
[105:18.76]What color is it?
[105:21.16]I'm assuming I have to get it from the octopus person.
[105:23.82]Yeah, check out what color.
[105:33.11]That's a blue button, ain't it?
[105:33.91]A lot of rooms here.
[105:40.77]A lot of rooms here.
[105:53.25]There they are.
[105:53.91]Oh, it's like doing the subtitles now.
[105:55.75]Okay, it was purple, green, purple, green, yellow.
[105:57.93]Purple, green, yellow.
[106:24.06]Got the colors.
[106:25.12]We got the colors, boys and girls!
[106:38.87]Thomas Jefferson.
[106:42.51]Now what the hell does that do?
[106:44.33]Hey, remember what the colors were.
[106:48.54]I'm assuming that turns on this vacuum.
[106:50.70]That can't be turned on because there's no power.
[106:56.53]I'm stretching.
[106:59.35]Yeah, I was remembering the colors.
[107:06.78]Yeah, what the hell?
[107:07.72]You're just like saying, you're repeating yourself very slowly.
[107:10.66]Purple, green, then yellow.
[107:15.90]And then yellow.
[107:19.28]Oh shit, no.
[107:19.78]Purple.
[107:21.22]You messed it up and that's all I've been talking about.
[107:23.53]Well, I'm trying to concentrate and there's a guy just like going... Do I boot him?
[107:31.62]What do you guys think?
[107:32.54]Should I boot him?
[107:34.68]Before I... I already clicked it, but... I mean, do you want to get booted or what?
[107:42.73]There's the quill.
[107:46.69]Let's go back to Thomas Jefferson.
[107:48.05]Give Thomas Jefferson the quill.
[107:51.83]I'm seeing a lot of yeses.
[107:53.29]I'm seeing a lot of yes Bodum.
[108:05.86]What does he do with the quill?
[108:09.58]Is he going to write me a parchment?
[108:16.30]You say the colors one more time like that, and you're gone.
[108:20.78]You're out of here.
[108:21.70]Huh?
[108:22.18]What does that mean?
[108:45.17]Okay, I guess we're going to write it down.
[108:53.09]I don't know what it means, but it's like a constellation, kind of.
[109:02.38]You talk to the ant president so you could get... There's definitely going to be like a George Washington ant or something.
[109:08.68]Like George Washington ant.
[109:11.16]Is that it all there is here?
[109:14.82]Actually, I want to see what were the colors on that.
[109:17.48]Yeah, make sure you write down colors.
[109:21.76]I wish I could vote you, but I can't.
[109:23.70]It's relevant.
[109:28.03]I guess the colors don't matter here.
[109:29.49]In Congress today... Okay.
[109:37.61]Okay.
[109:40.14]Yes, this is made.
[109:40.92]The creator of Earthworm Jim did make all these characters, and he's like the creator.
[109:46.92]Co-creator, I guess.
[109:48.42]There's another bunch of people that worked on it.
[109:52.56]What does that do for me?
[109:56.82]There's a bunch of rooms I still haven't gone in, so... Wasn't there something?
[110:05.17]Oh, shit.
[110:07.77]That's a symbol.
[110:08.65]Write it down.
[110:09.49]What color is it?
[110:13.45]Speaking of ants, there's an ant that's bothering me right now, and he's about to get booted.
[110:21.25]So, you know, let's give him a countdown.
[110:23.09]Oh, my God.
[110:24.57]If you end up needing to know what color that symbol was, you're really going to regret this.
[110:30.58]It's just like a Soviet.
[110:36.06]He's God, baby.
[110:47.89]Let me write this down.
[110:59.11]He really wanted to get that last word too.
[111:04.96]It's just like a ship.
[111:08.42]Yeah, poor drunk star.
[111:13.50]He had somewhere to go anyways.
[111:15.00]He needs to go eat food.
[111:16.88]Why don't you get shock jocked?
[111:20.32]Climb back up.
[111:30.11]Oh, damn.
[111:31.41]Can we go up higher?
[111:34.50]How does he get up there?
[111:40.07]Well, I mean, to be fair, right?
[111:42.01]To be fair.
[111:42.93]He was just typing.
[111:44.59]Very loudly.
[111:46.21]And then would just say the colors.
[111:47.84]I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[111:50.40]It's like, you get booted.
[112:00.75]That is that.
[112:01.37]Okay, so that's where the dog comes out.
[112:02.55]You talk to the person.
[112:06.15]But is there a dog hole I didn't go into?
[112:12.42]Let me go back over here.
[112:16.14]Hey, he was writing things down.
[112:18.44]He was writing things down.
[112:21.42]No dog hole here.
[112:22.82]That doesn't bring it back up.
[112:28.38]Oh, jeez.
[112:28.86]Oh, jeez.
[112:45.85]We'll continue in here.
[112:47.03]Can you go in the sewer?
[112:47.69]We need a dog hole.
[112:59.83]Maybe did I miss one that was down here?
[113:04.67]There was a button to press.
[113:06.19]I'm going to get from that lady.
[113:08.25]I'm going to get...
[113:15.17]Shit.
[113:16.89]Where is there another dog hole?
[113:18.33]Maybe... Hey, Seanbud.
[113:26.04]What's going on, dude?
[113:36.63]Did anybody see a dog hole?
[113:38.89]There was the exit for the dog hole.
[113:40.41]Maybe can I... I can't climb it and put him through.
[113:44.24]And there's no power.
[113:45.02]There won't be power until I talk to the octopus person.
[113:51.26]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[113:52.06]Hold on just a second here.
[113:56.34]Oh, I got it.
[113:57.94]I got it.
[113:58.30]I got it.
[113:58.60]Hold on.
[114:00.86]Whoa.
[114:01.24]No, no, no, no, no.
[114:02.08]I got to make that symbol.
[114:05.18]The symbol is from here.
[114:13.26]I need to determine where these guys are moving, because I wrote that symbol down.
[114:19.06]That's the first one, right?
[114:23.25]No, it goes down to the right.
[114:32.93]No, that's not it.
[114:33.53]Nope.
[114:43.96]I had him in the right spot.
[114:50.67]Well, what determines where they move?
[114:52.07]Is it just the empty spot?
[114:56.07]Because it goes right, left, right, up.
[114:59.85]So it would go bang, bang, bang, bang, right?
[115:05.70]Oh, this can move too.
[115:06.86]Shit.
[115:14.37]Maybe it's the laser has to come out.
[115:18.27]Okay.
[115:29.41]This needs to go right.
[115:33.09]That.
[115:36.27]No.
[115:40.81]Okay.
[115:45.26]I'm trying to determine, is the white line the one that's active, or the black line?
[115:55.90]It's almost there.
[115:58.19]This has to go down this way.
[115:59.43]Like, if this right now was going like that instead...
[116:16.03]You know what I mean?
[116:20.23]Like this way, this way, that way, that way.
[116:28.14]What determines if they connect?
[116:35.70]Maybe his mouth.
[116:40.64]Yeah, every time it's from his mouth.
[117:01.41]That's like it, but it's not the right way.
[117:03.59]It's like upside down.
[117:07.51]I'm assuming I have to shoot the laser into the mouth.
[117:19.16]I just don't know how to get it the way I want it.
[117:24.69]And am I trying to make it shoot into his mouth or have him go backwards?
[117:34.39]Hold on.
[117:47.29]This to that.
[117:47.99]I feel like there's some connection there.
[117:55.99]And I can't move this one now.
[118:09.56]I feel like I have to get this one up there.
[118:12.34]And then he has to be over here.
[118:19.82]So once he's here, that's the end.
[118:22.68]This is the end right here.
[118:25.60]So then it needs to go down this way.
[118:30.26]No.
[118:30.85]Let's move him over here.
[118:33.35]Oh, that's so close, but it's not right.
[118:35.15]That's so close.
[118:42.03]One, two, three, four.
[118:43.24]That's so close, but it's not right.
[118:52.68]Oh, hold on.
[118:57.52]no nope this needs to be that way cannon joins the dark lines
[119:27.30]The cannon's definitely in the right spot.
[119:31.49]I had it close before.
[119:32.47]I gotta move him back out of the way.
[119:52.70]So it has to go to here to...
[120:10.94]Laser should be in the right spot, right?
[120:15.54]Because wouldn't it come down like this?
[120:21.32]Put the laser here.
[120:23.38]Because then it would be
[120:31.66]no who was is close shit said this is really close to try to think about it for a move anything
[121:02.32]These have to be swapped, right?
[121:04.69]Hold on.
[121:05.19]Let's just do that.
[121:11.71]No, put him back.
[121:12.47]1, 2, 3, 4.
[121:31.91]Alright, so this is always going to come out like this, right?
[121:51.01]Let's see where it pops out from.
[121:52.73]Bottom here.
[121:53.31]Okay.
[122:01.95]no it's the way that it connects okay hold on
[122:34.62]Yeah, this kind of like has to go here, right?
[122:36.56]That has to go there.
[122:38.46]Because now I need it to come down and over.
[122:40.76]Done.
[122:49.17]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[122:55.23]Ah, shit.
[122:58.89]It's so close.
[123:07.92]It's close.
[123:25.15]I'm looking at the symbol from this perspective.
[123:33.69]Move this one over here for a second.
[123:43.30]No, these can be moved over here, but that doesn't help me at all.
[123:52.08]I'm going to put them back.
[123:53.36]Everyone go back.
[123:54.02]There needs to be a line here.
[124:04.68]You need to switch.
[124:07.52]How do I get this guy to get down here?
[124:11.36]You go down here and it's over.
[124:19.41]I wonder if he can't be connected to something.
[124:21.03]He has to go like around?
[124:34.95]He's down there now.
[124:35.85]Hold on.
[124:45.74]No, no, no, no.
[124:46.92]Come back here.
[124:47.78]No.
[124:49.68]Oh, it's just the connections are just confusing the hell out of me.
[125:10.00]There.
[125:10.28]Ah, shit.
[125:12.04]OK, I need to go.
[125:45.28]He needs to go down here.
[125:46.30]Oh, shit.
[125:55.76]Oops, I didn't mean to do that.
[126:03.02]Just for fun, I'm going to just move the cannon around a little more. ...
[126:16.26]I need to see it from every angle.
[126:28.59]Hold on.
[126:28.93]Hold on a second.
[126:36.35]He's almost down there.
[126:37.21]Okay.
[126:45.59]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[126:46.49]Hold on.
[126:58.84]It's just the wrong way.
[127:01.10]It's just the wrong way.
[127:02.38]One, two.
[127:04.87]It's all twisted.
[127:07.27]It's all twisted.
[127:38.30]There needs to be a connection here, but there's only two lines.
[127:43.54]You know what I mean?
[127:44.02]Like, I'm trying to... Because it has to be like this.
[127:48.59]One, two, three, four.
[127:51.75]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[127:53.01]There's five pieces.
[127:56.00]They only connect a certain way, like this, like with diagonals.
[128:13.17]I had it the right way before.
[128:52.77]Trying to get the cannon to go down there.
[129:21.28]Alright, hold on.
[129:23.35]This is so close.
[129:28.37]Hold on.
[129:29.13]So it's upside down in that way.
[129:40.94]This one's just like... I just keep getting confused.
[129:49.09]But I can't bring this guy back down.
[130:03.89]You go that way, you go this way.
[130:05.75]Fuck.
[130:08.39]Maybe we should pull a baby out.
[130:16.08]It's on.
[130:23.79]I was so close before.
[130:29.91]This way?
[130:30.43]That way?
[130:37.48]Hold on a second.
[130:44.93]This needs to make a V. This needs to be like that down here.
[130:57.69]Because the way I'm looking at it on the symbol, right?
[131:00.21]This has to be like that.
[131:04.79]How do I get that down there?
[131:06.27]Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[131:13.54]Hold on.
[131:18.02]Okay.
[131:25.80]No, I'm getting it.
[131:27.10]I got it.
[131:27.40]Hold on.
[131:33.41]Oh, yeah.
[131:34.83]Come on, now.
[131:38.35]No.
[131:38.93]No, not quite.
[131:39.47]Hold on.
[131:40.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[131:40.87]I got it.
[131:41.39]This is correct now.
[131:46.54]I need... Oh, shit.
[131:52.10]This has got to be in the middle.
[131:58.55]So this guy... Okay, this has got to go like that, and this has got to go like this.
[132:06.88]So he has to be here.
[132:08.96]Yeah, I got it.
[132:09.74]I got it.
[132:11.82]Just got to do some moving around.
[132:12.98]He has to be down here.
[132:13.80]Okay, now he has to be there.
[132:31.33]Because then that connects that.
[132:37.98]These two need to be swapped.
[132:47.99]That's correct.
[132:49.31]It just needs to make that V down here.
[132:50.99]Okay.
[133:09.18]Okay.
[133:17.17]That's it.
[133:17.73]Just needs to be rotated.
[133:20.11]That's one, two, three, four.
[133:22.87]Needs to go there.
[133:24.19]You need to go here.
[133:26.13]I did it!
[133:26.87]I did it, Mom!
[133:28.69]I did it, Mommy!
[133:33.29]I did it!
[133:38.99]Hey!
[133:46.73]You know, okay, so here's how I got crossed up there.
[133:50.49]I'm a fool.
[133:51.53]I didn't look at what I wrote down.
[133:54.10]Because, we'll look at it first.
[133:56.00]I wasn't thinking kind of outside the box.
[134:00.28]All I had to do was just make a V on the left and a V on the bottom.
[134:06.76]That was all I had to do.
[134:19.31]Okay.
[134:22.41]Let's see what's in the next room.
[134:28.55]Same thing, except it's a way to blog.
[134:30.19]Let's just go all the way through and take a look at everything.
[134:37.48]What the hell is wrong with this guy?
[134:45.96]Can I get up there?
[134:49.00]I guess I can't climb up that.
[134:53.24]I know what I can do though, I can push.
[134:58.01]Where did Beak Beak go?
[135:04.91]Where's the dog?
[135:09.68]Where the hell is the dog?
[135:18.18]No, I don't want to go over.
[135:36.42]I don't want to go.
[135:36.94]Where's the dog?
[135:43.48]He's just sitting on the button.
[135:44.80]Get over here!
[135:49.50]I forgot I had you sitting on that button.
[135:57.84]Yeah, Beak Beak, I've got a new button for you to step on.
[136:07.26]Yeah, step on this one.
[136:10.40]You're my button-pressing dog.
[136:13.06]Oh, thanks, little buddy.
[136:18.46]Did I, like, screw myself here?
[136:25.52]Or... Did I... I'm kind of scared that I might have just accidentally screwed that whole thing up.
[136:34.77]I can push this now.
[136:35.43]Okay.
[136:35.53]Don't go all the way back.
[136:44.58]Him stepping on that drops the block.
[136:51.37]So I gotta jump on this and then jump on him and then jump on his head and you know what you get to do.
[137:04.04]Look at his face.
[137:04.64]He's like, yes, I'm helping.
[137:07.82]He reminds me of little Otto.
[137:11.26]Go on, keep pushing.
[137:21.42]So now I'll get off.
[137:25.47]And that should loosen this one, right?
[137:34.25]No.
[137:38.27]Can I reset this one?
[137:59.44]Okay, hold on.
[138:04.15]You go ahead and stand on that, buddy.
[138:20.24]There we go.
[138:26.24]Let's see what's up here.
[138:34.72]I love how they just stretched this out.
[138:36.09]It's a little bug.
[138:46.49]That's it?
[138:48.27]A fly?
[138:51.07]Save it.
[138:58.55]Can that fly be put somewhere?
[139:01.98]I think so.
[139:03.88]Gotta have to.
[139:08.17]Where was there a spot for a fly?
[139:11.84]Was my question.
[139:24.41]I can suck up something here too, I gotta remember that.
[139:39.16]Can we fit in here?
[139:41.54]No.
[139:47.56]Can I put him in the dog bowl?
[139:49.20]Oh no, the baby's crying again.
[139:53.12]Don't I- Oh shit.
[139:57.66]Okay, um... Oh boy.
[140:11.82]Go on the right way.
[140:13.40]That one's all screwed up.
[140:27.20]I'm pretty sure this is right.
[140:32.08]We got octopus.
[140:34.02]Let me listen.
[140:56.22]No.
[140:58.70]I think that's right.
[141:01.33]No.
[141:04.47]No, this goes here.
[141:11.77]So it's there and there, right?
[141:14.09]No, here and here.
[141:20.56]Did I swap this the wrong way?
[141:30.14]Yeah, I wish there was like a speed up button.
[141:40.61]Hmm.
[141:41.29]Hmm.
[141:52.53]I hope I didn't do this wrong.
[141:54.03]I don't think I did, though.
[142:04.73]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[142:05.87]Where's it going?
[142:08.68]Okay, done.
[142:09.44]See, the worst part about this particular puzzle is this obviously is a staple of this game, so when I have to do the entire thing, it's going to be really annoying.
[142:28.06]And he dropped another crystal.
[142:30.62]That's the third crystal, by the way.
[142:34.62]That is crystal number three.
[142:39.16]Put the fly in here, maybe?
[142:40.89]Yep.
[142:44.79]What does that do?
[142:48.73]Uh.
[142:51.69]He just, like, died.
[142:52.69]Does he eat that?
[142:54.63]Beak Beak eats it now?
[142:58.77]I mean, it is a dog bowl, right?
[143:04.55]Doesn't Beak Beak fly when he eats a fly?
[143:08.60]Didn't that happen?
[143:12.96]Well, he ate it, so I can't get it back.
[143:20.38]Now, do I fly out here with Beak Beak?
[143:28.66]Maybe I take him up to that.
[143:30.00]Yeah, I might take him up to the area where I found the fly.
[143:42.05]I'm going to pee again.
[143:43.05]I've been drinking a bunch of coffee and I'm like piss boy right now.
[144:05.11]I just want to see if he can fly over here.
[144:08.55]I know the... Probably can take him to where that thing was above the octopus.
[144:14.31]But I just want to know.
[144:15.05]No, he can't even come down.
[144:15.87]Let's turn around.
[144:17.29]He can't even walk up it.
[144:27.34]So yeah, he'll fly up the vine.
[144:28.58]Yeah, I'm seeing it.
[144:30.76]I'm seeing it.
[144:45.26]I love these rooms.
[144:45.86]These are all so interesting.
[144:48.17]So interesting.
[144:49.91]Let me guess.
[144:50.67]You gonna get wings?
[144:52.89]You gonna fly up here?
[144:57.30]Come on.
[145:01.16]Uh, beak beak.
[145:03.66]What's going on here?
[145:14.62]Uh... Beak, beak.
[145:16.04]It'd be real nice if you could fly up there, buddy.
[145:19.36]It'd be really, really great if you could get up there, man.
[145:42.81]How do I get him to fly?
[145:57.56]Is there something I'm missing here, or is he not ready to fly yet?
[146:08.25]Can I?
[146:08.81]I don't think I can flatten the room.
[146:10.01]There's nothing in here.
[146:11.87]This is where the spinning wheel was, right?
[146:13.53]Over here.
[146:13.87]About this way.
[146:33.64]Because he ate it, I can't get it back.
[146:35.75]If he has something to give me, he'll spit it out in front of me.
[146:40.85]Well... Let's go!
[147:05.68]I can't go anywhere here.
[147:08.72]There was like a place in the area.
[147:15.24]Backtrack to the first room.
[147:17.20]Oh god.
[147:19.14]That might be a thing.
[147:22.79]Wasn't there something in this room that I missed?
[147:24.61]I feel like there was something else that I didn't do over here.
[147:38.76]Can you fly up there?
[147:40.22]Can you go up there, Beak Beak?
[147:43.00]No.
[147:53.95]No.
[147:56.73]Huh.
[148:01.57]So... This seems to be a little bit of a...
[148:16.73]There are no more flies to feed him.
[148:28.09]There's a button right here, though.
[148:29.34]I feel like I need to move this out of the way.
[148:34.72]But I can't.
[148:38.90]There's a big red button here, but I can't move this guy.
[149:03.85]Backtrack.
[149:05.45]Backtrack time.
[149:25.79]He already ate this.
[149:28.83]He already ate that.
[149:29.63]He already ate this.
[149:40.74]Oh my god.
[149:41.76]What?
[149:42.92]What?
[149:43.84]What the hell?
[149:44.58]How was I ever... What?
[149:46.68]You have to do it in the same room?
[149:47.98]Okay, well, let's talk.
[149:51.24]Let's see another cutscene with a bunch of gibberish.
[149:54.50]Here we go.
[149:55.83]I already did that, though.
[149:57.17]That's the thing.
[149:57.99]I think I had to do it twice.
[150:20.10]A real certain die a cata di enrique urdan da se anac a a redoc le dare sed.

[151:14.51]Eat it.
[151:18.77]Eat the... Thank you.
[151:22.49]Let's go in here.
[151:26.25]This is going to take me... I'm not entirely sure.
[151:29.20]There's a lever for the sewer.
[151:34.40]He sure can fit a lot of things in his stomach.
[151:48.98]That just said my name.
[151:50.18]That just said my name.
[151:52.04]That just said my fucking name.
[151:54.76]Are you kidding me?
[152:06.15]That's so cool.
[152:09.18]That just said... That was just Jerma985.
[152:15.15]I think this is showing some of the backers.
[152:19.23]I better write that down.
[152:20.23]I better write that down.
[152:22.65]Alright, well that's cool.
[152:30.10]That was cool.
[152:31.08]I got to see my... I got to write all these names down.
[152:37.46]Yeah, this is probably one of the Kickstarter credit roll things.
[152:45.35]That was very surprising.
[152:46.99]I did not expect to go into this room and then see my name on the screen.
[152:53.07]No, this is not the end of the game, by any means.
[152:55.98]Let's think about this.
[152:56.70]Is there anything I can actually do in this room?
[152:58.96]Or is this like a bonus Kickstarter room?
[153:03.20]There it was again.
[153:03.84]Alright, well, I guess let's... Let's leave.
[153:12.00]Well, we found the... We found that.
[153:24.23]I have a few things to give my friend down here oh
[153:54.70]Can I get out of this?
[153:59.59]Oh, thank God I can skip it.
[154:12.05]Hey, give me that stuff you just got.
[154:18.51]Grr.
[154:21.78]I can't even tell what that was.
[154:27.86]That's a lever for downstairs, and then that's also the thing to turn the power on.
[154:30.88]I don't know what I should do first, but I do know... Actually, I do know what I should do first.
[154:38.06]It's pee.
[154:39.46]So, I'll be right back.
[154:41.58]I've been drinking coffee, so, you know, it makes me... Just hold on a sec.
[154:44.68]I'll be right back.
[156:43.19]Write it down.
[156:43.81]It could be a clue.
[156:44.77]Yeah, this could be a clue.
[156:52.79]Alright, I just peed and forgot the entire game.
[156:56.07]What was happening?
[157:06.30]I got the piece.
[157:06.84]I got a couple pieces.
[157:07.72]Let's go down.
[157:08.16]I'm going to go down first.
[157:10.42]Let's go down.
[157:22.92]This is not the lever for right here.
[157:24.78]Alright.
[157:30.24]Call me stupid.
[157:30.82]I really thought that was going to be it.
[157:52.65]And... doink!
[157:58.07]No, whoops.
[158:00.23]Where was the power button?
[158:01.35]The other room over here?
[158:05.25]There it is.
[158:06.34]Except it's... not currently functioning.
[158:10.22]Now it is.
[158:17.62]Okay, well, let me go out back again.
[158:24.81]This should be functioning.
[158:25.91]It is functioning.
[158:34.20]So now does that allow me to use the shit downstairs?
[158:46.46]I can press this button though.
[158:48.70]Does that open the door?
[158:49.48]I hope so.
[158:50.87]Please open the door.
[159:00.20]Oh, I pressed the button.
[159:01.22]I can press it.
[159:07.40]Beep, beep.
[159:08.86]It's time for you to take another trip.
[159:23.36]Fly.
[159:31.06]Couple different ways to go here.
[159:32.02]I just saw that up here.
[159:33.02]Let's go here first.
[159:38.48]This is going to be confusing.
[159:39.56]Oh, boy.
[159:45.44]Oh, shit.
[159:45.90]I accidentally clicked out of the window.
[159:47.10]I always do that.
[159:52.47]Well, wish me luck because I have no idea where the hell I'm going.
[159:59.17]I found a button.
[160:15.00]That sounds like suction.
[160:22.90]Okay.
[160:24.36]So there's one of two things that are going to happen here.
[160:27.92]I suck up the cheese guy from the pipe that's in that room.
[160:37.85]I can push that block back and it sucks up and it's probably going to go back to that other room.
[160:44.74]Let's go down here.
[160:51.04]There's another lever.
[160:59.95]Go on, go down there.
[161:00.85]Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.
[161:10.25]That's all I could do up there, right?
[161:13.85]Let's go left just to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[161:19.30]No, I didn't, because this takes you all the way around, right?
[161:21.20]I think.
[161:23.04]Just to be clear, I'm just going to look up here and make sure... Yes, okay, let's leave.
[161:34.38]Yeah, he's flapping a lot.
[161:35.57]He is flapping so hard, that's... If he stopped doing what he was doing, he was going to hit the ground like brick.
[161:41.40]That's a lot of flapping.
[161:42.28]Alright, I'm going to move the cheese Cheetos block.
[161:47.16]Now I can open the other door.
[161:48.02]Let's just see what's in that other room first before I do anything else.
[161:53.87]Thank you.
[161:57.17]Very much.
[162:03.37]Has to go right here, right?
[162:09.40]Let's go.
[162:13.97]Well, there's the other lever.
[162:17.53]Oh, fuck.
[162:18.01]I didn't want to do that.
[162:24.76]Well, I did it, so let's just see what's over here.
[162:40.05]Can't go that way.
[162:46.70]Whoa.
[162:50.82]We can keep going?
[162:52.28]Look at this.
[162:52.82]Look at how crazy this is.
[162:55.92]What does that say?
[162:56.40]5%?
[162:56.42]5 over 50?
[162:56.56]Write it down.
[162:57.51]5?
[162:58.03]Is that 5% 50?
[162:59.71]What the hell is that symbol?
[163:05.87]50-50?
[163:06.25]50-50?
[163:17.38]The zero, that zero is really small.
[163:51.35]Damn.
[163:52.41]Okay, this is going to take a minute.
[164:05.47]Let's see how much that moves, and then I can determine how many more times I have to do it.
[164:08.03]That moved.
[164:16.11]One more, but I still can't go over there.
[164:18.78]Maybe this one moves that.
[164:24.61]I'm going to assume doing that is going to move this, so let's go move the second one once more.
[164:53.95]Thanks.
[165:00.97]Wait a second.
[165:04.09]Was that not moving that other one?
[165:06.56]This one here.
[165:09.72]Right?
[165:10.00]That should be moving... Which one is it moving?
[165:16.44]It's moving the green one.
[165:22.29]One more.
[165:28.93]One more or two more?
[165:30.48]One more.
[165:31.40]Then I have to bring this one all the way around again.
[165:32.94]So that's one, two.
[165:34.74]So one over here and then two over there.
[165:40.71]One.
[165:40.83]And then one, two.
[165:52.08]Do I re-chat at all?
[165:53.02]Of course I do.
[165:54.62]But I am trying to focus on the game because this requires a... Fuck, I did it too many times.
[166:06.41]With a game like this, I have to remember a lot of things and focus on a puzzle.
[166:09.85]It's hard to... I need to focus.
[166:15.26]How many more times?
[166:16.14]Can I only do it once per screen or something?
[166:19.16]No.
[166:19.48]Let's go.
[166:32.21]Hello, screen I've seen a million times.
[166:42.80]A lot of things to remember.
[166:43.70]I'm going back to the original area.
[166:45.58]Is this guy, like, dancing?
[166:56.81]What are these guys doing?
[167:03.30]There's something here I need to remember.
[167:08.73]You know what I mean?
[167:09.33]Is it in the order they do this?
[167:12.47]Or the colors?
[167:13.11]I have no idea.
[167:30.63]Well, it's three pinks and two grays.
[167:33.19]They were there when you looked out the window?
[167:41.76]Yeah, they were.
[167:47.46]Well, I'm just gonna... Pink, gray, pink, pink, gray.
[167:53.03]Pink, gray, pink, pink, gray.
[167:56.69]Just, I don't know, I feel like they're gonna need to... It's probably the order they're chirping to.
[168:03.07]One pink.
[168:04.39]Gray.
[168:05.13]Gray.
[168:08.29]Okay.
[168:17.11]Oh, five.
[168:17.77]No idea.
[168:18.35]If we need to come back, we come back.
[168:26.28]You're out here.
[168:26.80]Thanks a lot.
[168:27.14]Thanks for coming.
[168:28.08]Take it easy, dude.
[168:34.66]Whole another room.
[168:36.10]Whole another area.
[168:36.94]This one has a gigantic scratch on it.
[168:43.10]Looks like someone tried to break in.
[168:48.63]Another one of these.
[168:50.49]Oh, shit.
[168:54.45]This is not fair.
[168:56.83]That's not fair at all.
[169:02.26]Which one goes on the bottom?
[169:03.86]I need to look at the bottom first.
[169:09.28]So it's a swirl.
[169:12.04]This one, right?
[169:13.03]It's the only one that exists.
[169:18.35]Holy shit.
[169:19.03]This is going to be difficult because I need to know exactly which one
[169:29.88]so that's that so it comes up and around the left so that one or that oh my god it could be any wikipedia in one of these it's this one right let me look at it the way it's supposed to be looked at comes up around her left her right thigh
[169:59.71]Is it that one?
[170:05.45]That one first.
[170:06.83]That's obviously the top piece.
[170:11.85]It has a little bit of a bump to it, though.
[170:18.71]Could be that one.
[170:21.13]Well, let me get some of these out.
[170:25.85]I need to get, obviously, the bottom one out.
[170:29.50]Because I can't bring more than one.
[170:30.96]They're the different colored ones.
[170:32.40]Maybe it's the ones that are colored differently.
[170:34.28]Okay.
[170:59.10]Okay.
[171:16.31]These have to go down.
[171:17.19]I'm turning my head sideways.
[171:24.13]It's this one, right?
[171:25.71]Let's take a look.
[171:26.55]Oh yeah, definitely.
[171:28.69]Definitely that one.
[171:29.51]I just want to make sure it was that one.
[171:38.95]Go back up here.
[171:47.58]It's turning my head from side to side.
[172:18.87]Shit, these have to come out.
[172:40.71]No, I'm doing it backwards.
[172:47.90]This needs to be right.
[172:48.63]That one has to switch with this one.
[172:52.46]Everybody come out.
[172:53.46]Come on out, all of you.
[173:17.14]That one's next, right?
[173:52.57]Go that way.
[173:54.36]Get out of my way, block.
[174:00.78]Is that the one?
[174:01.70]That is the one.
[174:05.40]Open the door.
[174:06.05]Oh, I got it, guys.
[174:10.43]I got it.
[174:10.79]Everyone just chill out.
[174:12.21]Everyone hang out a second.
[174:13.19]Everyone just calm down.
[174:15.85]I got it.
[174:16.35]It's alright.
[174:16.93]Don't worry about it.
[174:30.47]Okay, we're in another area with another pump.
[174:34.68]I feel like the pumps matter, the colors of the pumps.
[174:36.90]Because this is a blue one.
[174:37.88]The one before this was purple.
[174:39.12]The one before it was red, right?
[174:56.62]This is a really cool looking room, by the way.
[175:00.84]Anything to tell me, mister?
[175:02.12]Outside solutions, huh?
[175:04.46]Okay.
[175:28.30]A generous meal can often weigh heavily in your favor.
[175:34.22]Let's go.
[175:41.45]Come on, Beak Beak.
[175:44.99]So there's a monster in here apparently or somebody else is in here.
[175:48.15]Another octopus to tell us more of a story.
[175:55.74]Eggs.
[175:56.92]You can't go wrong with eggs.
[175:59.16]Keep going.
[176:03.54]We're going to get to see another president.
[176:04.57]There's going to be another president ant in here.
[176:06.59]Hope you guys are ready.
[176:10.27]Bully!
[176:14.37]What?
[176:15.49]That's all you got, Roosevelt?
[176:17.61]Bully!
[176:24.63]Bully.
[176:27.71]So that's all I'm going to get from him is bully.
[176:38.44]Pink, gray, pink, pink, gray.
[176:41.68]I'm just making sure because it's showing me this again.
[176:46.50]We can fly.
[176:47.46]We're not going to do that yet.
[176:50.98]I want to see what this is on the wall.
[177:08.50]Okay, so you have to make one of the robot.
[177:15.17]Well, let's simply look at what they look like.
[177:20.13]Let's try this one.
[177:21.85]This one has the thing on the top left.
[177:24.91]I guess I can't make that one.
[177:38.27]What about this one?
[177:39.73]Top left, bottom right.
[177:43.59]That's the right one, isn't it?
[177:47.16]What about the middle?
[177:48.28]Three on this, and then that.
[177:54.48]Wait, hold on, no.
[177:55.44]This one doesn't have that right.
[177:56.94]There we go.
[177:59.03]Now he's got a claw for a hand.
[178:03.91]Yep.
[178:05.23]The body is that.
[178:08.25]Triangle with the square on the right.
[178:11.45]I think that's the right one, right?
[178:15.54]Yeah, that's the right one.
[178:17.28]And then the head is the knife sticking out of his neck.
[178:20.44]And the pretzel on the left.
[178:21.74]Okay.
[178:27.83]Nope, there's no hole on the right.
[178:33.62]Like that.
[178:34.10]Okay, let's try this one.
[178:37.08]Oh, nope.
[178:47.08]Saw?
[178:47.38]What is a saw?
[178:53.16]Oh, that's right.
[178:58.73]Is the bottom one wrong?
[179:02.27]Oh, the bottom one has the three.
[179:03.67]Yeah, this one is wrong.
[179:06.38]It's this one.
[179:21.94]One, two.
[179:23.81]One, two.
[179:25.61]Unless it's on the other right.
[179:27.49]No, it is.
[179:33.50]Right one's more curvy.
[179:34.38]Let's just take a look through this one.
[179:43.51]Oh, is it a fist?
[179:44.85]It's like the glove.
[179:46.55]Yeah, it's that.
[179:49.39]No, it's not that one.
[179:50.30]Okay.
[179:51.06]So it is not this robot.
[179:52.08]Because that went way over.
[180:00.64]What about?
[180:03.36]So we just did this one.
[180:04.52]No, I didn't.
[180:17.32]He has one line on his chest.
[180:23.27]That is the one.
[180:31.70]Is the head correct?
[180:32.34]Is the head of a... Head does.
[180:36.67]So that's the head.
[180:37.29]The head is correct.
[180:38.79]The upper body has the line, the circle here, and then it's filled.
[180:45.44]Line, circle here, and it's filled.
[180:49.00]Yeah, that's right.
[180:59.83]That's right.
[181:00.63]One line.
[181:01.69]One line.
[181:04.88]One line.
[181:05.30]One line.
[181:05.74]Let me just make sure.
[181:09.40]Hold on.
[181:09.72]There it is.
[181:12.84]Drop the egg, please.
[181:17.16]Hey, it landed.
[181:18.32]Ooh.
[181:28.26]Okay.
[181:34.43]You know, it's good that I picked to do this one.
[181:37.09]Because otherwise I would have been here a long time, huh?
[181:39.96]This is the correct one.
[181:41.58]If I started like, oh, let's start over here.
[181:44.90]I would have been here a while.
[181:50.96]Yay!
[181:54.13]Now why should he be able to eat this?
[181:59.37]Should he fly out there?
[182:00.31]I mean, he can go in here, but...
[182:04.07]I guess he's gonna go in there.
[182:17.98]Octopus.
[182:20.46]Hey, look at that.
[182:21.92]Time for an octopus story, guys.
[182:23.84]I can't wait.
[183:30.67]Are we sure I didn't change the language in the settings?
[183:35.07]That'd be funny.
[183:36.07]This one is... I don't know what color this octopus was, but...
[184:00.17]What color were the octopus's lips?
[184:03.21]Because to see the symbol above his head.
[184:06.93]That's a symbol that we need to write down.
[184:17.49]What would you do if someone gave you a million dollar donation on stream?
[184:20.35]I would immediately refund it.
[184:25.73]That's a scary amount of money.
[184:32.46]Get down here.
[184:42.61]Give me what you picked up.
[184:44.29]Please.
[184:50.05]Take that.
[184:53.69]And the lever.
[184:59.09]Thank you.
[185:00.73]That's it.
[185:01.91]Let's go.
[185:06.50]Now, is Theodore Roosevelt gonna tell me something?
[185:11.35]Bully!
[185:14.51]Nope.
[185:15.61]He's still gonna say bully.
[185:26.25]Oh, shit.
[185:28.94]Not this again.
[185:29.78]Oh, no.
[185:38.82]Let me remember this.
[185:39.70]It was... I really should have written it down.
[185:43.35]You know what I mean?
[185:43.85]Like, I should have written down the pattern because now I have to do, like, the whole thing.
[185:51.61]No.
[185:52.01]It was... This was here.
[185:55.43]This was... Where the hell is this fuzzy son of a bitch?
[186:06.04]I don't know I don't like no I don't remember I think that this is this is kinda close now I didn't you know I'm gonna write this down shit I think that's right when it when I get this right I'm writing this whole thing down because I'm gonna have to do the whole thing probably eventually
[186:40.76]rewatch the broadcast don't fall off
[187:10.36]Okay, got it.
[187:12.96]I want to write this down.
[187:15.10]It's gone.
[187:16.18]It's gone.
[187:18.10]Can't write it down.
[187:18.64]It's gone.
[187:24.46]Creepy.
[187:32.79]It's okay.
[187:45.27]No!
[187:49.17]Stole the baby.
[187:50.97]What are we gonna do now?
[187:52.72]We're going to get pee back.
[187:59.92]Alright, I'm kind of glad that I don't have the baby anymore.
[188:03.50]Because it means I don't have to do the song thing anymore.
[188:05.40]Alright, what were we doing?
[188:12.17]Something before the guy stole my baby.
[188:19.17]Oh, I can power this now.
[188:25.15]Please plug it into the device.
[188:26.37]The power button was back here, I believe.
[188:33.46]If I remember correctly.
[188:47.81]This is the Neverhood spiritual successor.
[188:54.33]This is not a sequel to the Neverhood.
[188:56.91]Same style, same people that worked on it, but not a direct sequel.
[189:03.92]Alright.
[189:04.42]Do you have anything new to tell me now?
[189:08.56]Bully!
[189:08.92]Nope.
[189:20.27]Let's go upstairs.
[189:21.91]Or downstairs.
[189:37.60]Can't go down.
[189:38.22]Can go up.
[189:48.04]purple face.
[189:50.12]I'm not sure it matters.
[189:54.18]But, you know, it might.
[190:02.88]Did I miss anything here?
[190:05.18]Well, now I can go across because the... I did the egg thing, so now I can go this way.
[190:15.60]One of these is definitely Bill from The Neverhood, by the way.
[190:18.99]Leave the hook.
[190:25.55]Write it down.
[190:38.96]Minus plus.
[190:43.05]Got the block down here, going across.
[190:50.32]Square.
[190:55.02]And what a bunch of odd symbols.
[191:03.92]It's a box within a box.
[191:06.65]Or no, more like a... Like that.
[191:11.79]Two lines.
[191:16.65]Done.
[191:32.52]Okay.
[191:33.50]Uh... Um... Should I write this down too, right?
[191:43.55]Yeah.
[191:49.04]Shit.
[191:50.54]More symbols.
[191:51.28]This one's odd.
[192:14.99]Hey, there's the music kicking in for me.
[192:16.69]Thanks, music.
[192:27.82]I want to go back for a second because I think one of these wasn't filled in over here.
[192:34.88]It's more fun to write it down, though.
[192:36.18]Oh, fuck.
[192:36.74]I clicked out.
[192:45.49]That way.
[192:45.83]Okay.
[192:47.11]Make sure I remember that.
[192:50.97]I like keeping a notebook.
[192:52.15]It's fun.
[192:52.53]I could, like, take a picture with my iPhone.
[192:54.63]But then I thought about it.
[192:55.31]I was like, you know what?
[192:55.81]I want to, like, write it down.
[192:56.49]I want to keep my detective notebook back.
[193:04.48]Okay.
[193:04.94]Well, we teleported.
[193:15.31]That's the solution.
[193:17.59]Like I told you, that was such a good, lucky guess to do that one first, because if you came over here first, you would have seen that that was the correct one.
[193:24.99]Now we have another one of these.
[193:26.89]Oh, boy.
[193:27.47]I'm not even sure there's a way to tell.
[193:38.51]Let's move all this out of the way to see...
[193:48.65]Baby?
[193:54.11]What did he scratch?
[193:54.91]There was something scratched off.
[194:02.66]Didn't he scratch off the part of the door?
[194:04.92]Maybe it's there on the door.
[194:05.98]I'm going to check behind all these.
[194:08.54]Make sure it's not listed here somewhere.
[194:13.40]It's not behind this.
[194:23.33]No.
[194:25.53]Well, it's somewhere.
[194:29.79]It's definitely the guy holding, or it's definitely the guy that took the baby, but I mean, there's a bunch of different faces here.
[194:35.05]It could be any one of these.
[194:37.83]There's like two or three versions of the same face, and you gotta get it exact.
[194:41.10]I don't want to just, yeah, I'm gonna have to figure it out.
[194:46.94]It looks like Darkwing Duck.
[194:51.88]Ugh.
[194:54.46]Yeah, I'm gonna have to come back to this, I think.
[194:59.52]There's no way I can do that without knowing what the right picture is.
[195:02.50]Oh, he can go in here.
[195:08.91]Maybe the picture's in here.
[195:12.21]That would sure be swell!
[195:22.99]There's the picture.
[195:30.75]Gotta write that down.
[195:32.45]I have to draw this correctly.
[195:35.53]No, you know what?
[195:36.23]Fuck it.
[195:38.93]This is what I'm going to take a picture of.
[195:41.52]This is the one I'm going to take the picture of.
[195:46.18]I went through all that trouble of describing the notebook.
[195:49.12]No, no, no.
[195:49.56]I'm going to use the notebook.
[195:52.03]The notebook is like, it's so key.
[195:53.77]It's gotta be the notebook.
[195:57.95]I just went back on my word and I'm not using the notebook now.
[196:02.53]I just took a picture with my iPhone.
[196:07.08]Cheater!
[196:09.52]Wait, was anything else in this room?
[196:13.54]You want me to draw?
[196:14.22]If I draw this, are you kidding me?
[196:18.50]What?
[196:18.86]What's this?
[196:21.27]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[196:23.61]Hold on.
[196:25.03]I wrote all this down.
[196:30.68]So it was this one that was filled in with the plus and minus there.
[196:41.37]Good thing I wrote it down.
[196:45.41]And then where is it?
[196:48.37]The box in the middle.
[196:49.99]This one.
[196:52.71]Alright, it's filled in.
[196:53.57]Is there another one that's not filled in?
[196:55.31]No.
[197:01.11]That's all correct.
[197:04.91]What does that do?
[197:10.34]Shouldn't this do something?
[197:12.82]Is there an indication that I just did this?
[197:21.64]Huh.
[197:25.97]It was already on the second sequence.
[197:27.97]That's the thing.
[197:39.85]What was that?
[198:11.06]I can't move this anymore.
[198:14.70]Well, there we go.
[198:22.44]I don't know.
[198:23.02]I mean, I guess just for fun, I'm going to put it back.
[198:27.07]I'm just going to try the other one just for fun.
[198:35.53]Just make sure I didn't miss anything.
[198:42.94]That's the other one.
[198:43.52]So we're going to put it on the one now.
[198:48.01]I think it was on this one to begin with.
[199:03.62]Blink, blink, blink.
[199:05.02]Blink, blink, blink.
[199:08.74]And this is... Let me write that one down.
[199:22.17]Everyone's doing like the triangles.
[199:34.28]Maybe that did change the path.
[199:35.58]We'll find out.
[199:47.96]So I am getting very hungry.
[199:54.51]So I'm going to potentially do this and then go get some food.
[199:58.87]Oh, he's spitting something out.
[199:59.89]That's right.
[200:00.37]He's got this.
[200:01.67]Give me that.
[200:06.49]Okay.
[200:06.77]Let me look at this picture of Darkwing Duck.
[200:13.29]The eyes, the head has, oh God, I can't even like see.
[200:20.59]I think this is the right head, right?
[200:22.21]Right here.
[200:25.72]Is that the right head?
[200:32.46]Yes.
[200:36.53]That is the right head.
[200:42.11]So this is going to go over here for now.
[200:45.97]Where's the eyes?
[200:47.47]Oh, this is going to be so hard for me to figure this shit out.
[200:50.06]No, those are not right.
[200:52.66]Where are the right eyes?
[200:58.23]He's looking to the left, kind of.
[201:00.51]I think it's down here.
[201:02.81]I need to make sure.
[201:05.89]I don't want to screw this one up.
[201:08.07]So let's flip it around.
[201:14.64]Could be.
[201:15.50]It could be.
[201:22.02]Wait, what?
[201:22.76]Hold on.
[201:23.40]So it has to...
[201:25.58]So it needs to go up because this doesn't fit down here.
[201:30.70]God, this is making my head hurt.
[201:34.59]There's only three eyes and one of them... Where's the helmet?
[201:40.55]Where's the head?
[201:43.83]Is this the right head?
[201:45.37]I think so.
[201:48.32]Let me get that over there.
[201:50.14]This is going to be very slow because I need to make sure I'm doing this correctly.
[201:57.93]Is that the right body?
[202:03.48]I can't even... I don't even know what piece of the body that is.
[202:06.60]Are those hands?
[202:21.11]No, this has got to go up this way.
[202:36.96]That's the right head, for sure.
[202:40.66]That is not the right eyes because, look, it's the wrong way.
[202:44.18]So it really just determines how to match it up the right way.
[202:49.41]So the right eyes are the ones that are down here.
[202:55.25]Let's just see.
[203:00.25]I don't know.
[203:09.85]So I flip this upside down.
[203:11.26]Yep, those are the right ones.
[203:18.72]I gotta get those back up.
[203:19.74]Shit.
[203:22.51]I'm seeing all these pieces really messing with my brain.
[203:25.25]So these have to come back down.
[203:26.93]I gotta get that one out of the bottom, though.
[203:46.52]I'm just going to do this piece by piece.
[203:55.65]Like, I'll figure it out later, I think.
[203:57.01]Hold on, what's that one?
[204:01.37]Oh, shit, I lost the picture.
[204:04.93]There it is.
[204:05.33]Okay, so the body's hand comes across.
[204:07.56]Let's see.
[204:14.91]This is going to be very, very annoying.
[204:16.45]I need the mouth.
[204:23.78]His mouth has this like... That's it right there, right?
[204:31.14]I think.
[204:35.86]Pretty sure that's the right mouth.
[204:39.80]Let's see.
[204:43.78]Yeah, that's correct.
[205:02.80]Getting there.
[205:03.24]We're getting there.
[205:04.58]We're getting closer.
[205:06.68]Now I need to go down to his hand.
[205:10.98]Which is the right way this way?
[205:13.66]No.
[205:16.60]It's hard to tell what hand is even going the right way here.
[205:25.09]I think it's the one down the bottom.
[205:27.79]This one.
[205:33.89]Yes, it is.
[205:46.49]Alright, what's the last one?
[205:47.61]The hand coming down on the right.
[205:54.58]Is it... It's like fingers and shit.
[205:58.66]Is it this one?
[205:59.14]Is it the one that I just had?
[206:00.18]Nope.
[206:07.40]It's definitely not this one.
[206:14.00]There it is.
[206:15.32]Okay, that was kind of strange.
[206:22.25]No power.
[206:30.77]No power.
[206:31.91]No power.
[206:34.01]I did pick up a power thing, though.
[206:38.60]I want to see what that potentially changed when I moved the blocks.
[206:42.72]Because I did change all those blocks that were over here.
[206:51.43]And ba-boom.
[206:54.61]Ba-da-boom.
[207:02.16]They look power.
[207:12.61]I'm assuming I can put this in here and then there'll be power and this thing up the stairs that goes that way to do this puzzle and figure out the game and win the game.
[207:21.63]No, this- Octopus.
[207:22.93]This is the octopus part.
[207:26.27]Remember I told you about the octopus?
[207:50.08]Okay, well, the first octopus was the one with the rectangle.
[208:22.09]So in the second one we saw was the... Let me see.
[208:26.25]So servitude, family, hope, honor.
[208:32.74]It's going the right way.
[208:33.36]Servitude, family, hope, honor.
[208:38.18]Servitude, family, hope, honor.
[208:41.80]I'm going to write underneath them.
[208:44.02]Servitude, family, hope, honor.
[208:47.09]Servitude, family, hope, honor.
[208:52.31]This one is hope.
[208:56.45]Servitude.
[208:57.13]No.
[208:57.63]Honor.
[209:03.15]Okay.
[209:03.57]Bye-bye.
[209:09.25]That should allow us to get in the door that we just had.
[209:25.85]I'm actually curious about something.
[209:26.99]I'm gonna go up.
[209:30.21]Can I go?
[209:31.03]Oh, yeah, let's go.
[209:36.89]I'm gonna go back down there, but I want to see what's in this room over here, because I can turn the power on now.
[209:53.88]Oh, damn!
[209:56.24]I just looked at the chat.
[209:58.32]Maybe they're speaking English now.
[210:01.26]Instead of... Okay, that's kind of cool if that's what that did.
[210:12.30]Yep.
[210:12.70]I'm going to be able to understand them now.
[210:15.60]So, this is cool.
[210:17.18]This is cool.
[210:18.19]This is going to tell the whole story.
[210:20.55]So, we need to do it in order.
[210:23.65]This is not the right order.
[210:25.81]But, I mean, this right here is the last part of the story, right here.
[210:34.80]You have made it far.
[210:37.00]Mother and father must be pleased with your courage and honor.
[210:41.53]Yet, all is for naught without saving the child.
[210:46.51]Vognath has her, and is building a machine to extract her power.
[210:52.05]A process she will never survive.
[210:55.57]Take this.
[210:57.07]It's the final piece you will need.
[211:01.95]Spit it down on me.
[211:07.08]So what is it?
[211:07.68]No, I gotta go listen to the other part of the story.
[211:09.82]I gotta go all the way back.
[211:10.66]You wanna talk about backtrack?
[211:16.60]You didn't think we were going to backtrack to the very beginning?
[211:19.14]That's exactly what we're going to do.
[211:32.48]We're going all the way back.
[211:35.76]Because I want to see it from the beginning.
[211:41.43]Hope you guys are ready.
[211:44.24]Hope you guys are ready to go all the way back.
[211:47.83]If I even remember how to get there.
[211:49.27]This is going to take a long time.
[211:57.69]Okay, no.
[212:08.03]I didn't have to do anything there.
[212:13.13]So where is the last... Let me just... Hold on a sec.
[212:17.79]I'm going to flip through my notes here.
[212:22.03]I'm going to flip through my fucking notes.
[212:32.45]Beak, beak, see how to go back.
[212:35.65]Can we even go all the way back?
[212:36.79]I think we can.
[212:37.63]I'm pretty sure we can.
[212:42.56]Goodlet!
[212:48.34]Big, big, change it back to normal, you... Fucking dog!
[212:53.53]Hey, can I get over on either side?
[213:02.21]There was a, like a... I can go down.
[213:07.02]I didn't even do this.
[213:22.76]Oh no.
[213:26.22]Guys?
[213:30.76]This symbol was on the wall a while back.
[213:40.89]This was somewhere too.
[213:41.85]Shit!
[213:42.57]I didn't write him down!
[213:47.46]I didn't write them down.
[213:48.36]That was my downfall.
[213:50.18]That was the downfall.
[213:51.64]I didn't write these ones down.
[213:55.28]Let's just go in and see what's going on here.
[213:57.43]Let's just go through.
[213:58.05]This is the baby.
[214:11.82]Can I... Pee!
[214:17.23]Not so fast, brother of mine.
[214:20.14]Vognat, come on.
[214:21.40]Let's be reasonable.
[214:22.64]You've got to let me get her out of that thing.
[214:25.58]Oh, no.
[214:26.42]I need her power.
[214:27.88]It's wasted on her anyhow.
[214:29.34]I'll put it to real use.
[214:31.16]Vognat, don't.
[214:35.93]Sorry.
[214:36.31]Too late.
[214:38.05]Hm?
[214:47.45]Oh shit!
[214:48.11]Did he just kill my dog?
[215:34.33]I feel like we're not focusing on the fact that my dog just insta-died.
[215:46.15]The dog that's been with me the whole game is dead.
[215:50.13]What the hell?
[215:55.02]What?
[215:58.78]Okay.
[216:00.06]Beak, beak.
[216:00.76]Rest in peace.
[216:06.10]Here are the... This is the last piece of power.
[216:10.76]I can actually turn this on now.
[216:14.51]Huh?
[216:14.83]How do I even fill the...
[216:36.20]hope servitude honor mustache guy grab the mustache oh okay drag it
[217:07.63]Yeah, the symbols.
[217:09.03]I feel like I need to watch the cutscenes again.
[217:15.31]I'm going to go back.
[217:17.47]Let's go back to the first octopus.
[217:19.19]That's what we're going to do to begin with.
[217:22.37]Is this the first octopus?
[217:28.72]So this is octopus number one.
[217:32.44]This is octopus number one.
[217:34.72]Let's see what he has to say.
[217:39.22]Ah, welcome, I must tell you.
[217:42.34]In service to Father, my Obdivator kin and I have seen much within these grand walls, most of it glorious, yet some tragic as well.
[217:55.23]It is the planet, Spiro V, where you now find yourself.
[217:59.64]Entombed in the fortress, Armacrog.
[218:03.08]Created by father as one home for science magic, goodwill, and servitude.
[218:08.75]In Armacrog, we enjoyed a peaceful existence, safe from the Longrolls, wandering Gelidzor, and other dangers indigenous to Spiro V.
[218:22.00]Then, one day, without warning, Omicron fell under attack by a fierce warrior who, while lacking ultimate power, possessed intelligence sufficient to find a weakness in Omicron and breach its defenses.
[218:42.20]Father and Mother, as evil as they were, knew the state of Omicron.
[218:47.43]All I need is hope, servitude.
[218:49.51]This interloper, a lost soul disfigured by ego and envy, saw the power of Armacrog for his own gain, and saw Mother as the key to this power.
[219:02.20]Father put forth a grave defense, but alas, was struck down by his foe.
[219:10.89]Struck down, but his essence lives on here in Armacrog.
[219:21.54]Bad guy comes, wants the power of the Armikrog Fortress.
[219:24.83]Servitude is the X with the square with the little lines on it.
[219:27.99]Each one of these sentient octopi are gonna give me one of those.
[219:33.39]So that's the first one, we gotta go to the second one.
[219:37.22]So that, this is the... Servitude, and I got servitude from the rectangle, I just remembered that.
[219:45.44]This notebook is such a fucking mess.
[219:50.06]seriously okay so now where was the second one second octopus was this way
[220:19.76]What?
[220:25.34]I just heard... Did he just... Did I just hear the dog?
[220:31.14]I swear to God, I just heard the dog.
[220:34.86]Oh yeah, I have multiple pieces of paper.
[220:36.50]They're just all over the place.
[220:41.31]I'm hungry, too.
[220:42.57]I feel like I'm pretty close to the end, though.
[220:44.73]In the next, maybe, half hour, 45.
[220:49.22]Went the wrong way, I think.
[220:56.04]What was the second octopus?
[220:58.14]Down around this way, right?
[220:59.52]Because this is the second area to go to.
[221:14.48]Beak, beak.
[221:27.08]How many bugs have... I've actually seen... Believe it or not, I heard this game had a lot of technical problems with it.
[221:34.83]I don't think I've seen any.
[221:36.75]I don't think I've seen one technical bug with this game.
[221:40.17]Why is this blocked?
[221:47.84]Is this door locked now?
[221:51.82]Okay.
[221:58.04]That's unfortunate.
[222:01.42]Yeah, the only bug I've seen was with audio.
[222:03.26]That was it.
[222:03.68]There was one bug in like the four hours or whatever I've been playing this game.
[222:07.43]Do I have to go down?
[222:31.44]Have I even gone this way?
[222:32.57]I don't even remember.
[222:40.41]Here we are.
[222:40.89]Now, which one is this?
[222:50.90]There's an octopus in here.
[222:51.88]I think this is the third one or the fourth one.
[222:56.64]Let's see.
[222:58.93]This is the...
[223:01.72]This is the second octopus.
[223:05.60]I believe.
[223:06.83]Let's see.
[223:07.29]Let's get it.
[223:08.35]I got my hands ready.
[223:11.33]My Octavator sibling told you of the attack upon Spiro V, I presume.
[223:17.26]Allow me to continue.
[223:19.86]Our fortress had been breached, but Father was prepared.
[223:24.81]Designed with an Omicron was a hidden defense mechanism Father added to ensure the safety of his planet, his people, his family.
[223:34.57]The intruder had attacked, believing it was another who was key to the power he desired.
[223:41.46]But she knew the truth.
[223:43.96]The power resides in their infant daughter, Peele.
[223:48.55]Hiding Peele from sight, Mother hurried to initiate Father's plan, but was interrupted just as she began the activation procedure.
[223:58.17]The intruder, called Bognut, saw Mother's empty shell and realized his mistake.
[224:05.47]She did not hold the power after all.
[224:08.45]There must be another.
[224:10.74]Okay.
[224:16.42]Family is the circle with the three circles on it.
[224:26.17]Alright.
[224:27.41]Servitude.
[224:27.77]We got servitude, family.
[224:28.71]We need hope.
[224:30.75]And... What was the other one we need?
[224:32.73]Hope.
[224:36.61]Shit.
[224:42.69]It's not the right way.
[224:50.07]Hope and honor.
[224:51.47]Of the last two.
[225:01.44]I feel like I need to suck something up this.
[225:02.84]Don't... Wasn't there... Remember with the button I pressed?
[225:07.64]And it made the vacuum sound?
[225:14.32]Am I crazy?
[225:14.92]Remember when Beak Beak was up there and there was a button to press and it made the vacuum sound?
[225:20.66]I don't know.
[225:28.08]Where's the dog?
[225:30.66]I think you might have missed what happened earlier, unfortunately.
[225:55.24]down the vine down the vine what was out here I forget where the other one was was it this way I mean hold on because through this door is yeah this is where he flies up and hits the button so we gotta go down here
[226:26.58]Let's continue.
[226:29.03]Did I miss one of the sentient octopus people?
[226:35.59]I feel like I missed somebody.
[226:36.59]Okay, go up.
[226:46.38]I forget which way to go.
[226:47.44]It's not that way.
[226:59.40]There's the 50-50.
[226:59.74]There's the 5% 5-0.
[227:00.08]Go on.
[227:00.24]Get over there.
[227:00.64]Get up.
[227:26.59]speed it up speed it up anything change up here with these weird birds I swear it's gonna be like and remember the five birds of our ancestors pinky grayson pink mondo pink modo and gray sanity remember their names I swear to god it's gonna be something like that whatever
[228:02.98]Let's go!
[228:03.63]He's right here and he's well fed.
[228:12.19]Don't worry.
[228:12.71]What?
[228:12.81]That's an odd dream to have.
[228:13.65]Get up there.
[228:30.47]What are you doing, man?
[228:31.97]Okay, let's activate it again.
[228:37.55]Uh-oh.
[228:38.31]Okay, good.
[228:38.71]Let's see what you have to say.
[229:01.82]Did I already do this one?
[229:06.38]Did I already do this one?
[229:09.04]No, I didn't.
[229:09.78]Okay, here we go.
[229:10.62]This is the... I missed one.
[229:12.45]But we'll get it, though.
[229:17.71]You know of Argonaut.
[229:19.51]You know of the attack.
[229:21.25]Allow me to tell you what came next.
[229:23.88]Vognat, believing Mother was dead, began his search for the child.
[229:28.54]But Mother was still alive, in a fashion.
[229:32.62]She had used the Soul Transfer Device to insert her being into the fortress, the first of a two-step process which would activate Father's defense mechanism.
[229:42.56]Yes, she had narrowly escaped Vognat's blast, but the Soul Transfer Device was destroyed, forever trapping her within the walls of Armachron.
[229:52.80]The original plan was for Father to use the Soul Transfer device to complete the first step.
[229:59.61]He would insert himself into Armachrog, while Mother would perform the second step, power up the machinery from the control panel located in the Emerald Room.
[230:10.13]However, with Father killed by Vognat, Mother's only option was to inhabit the fortress herself.
[230:17.76]And hope that Father Spirit could somehow find a way to activate the console.
[230:22.43]Where is it?
[230:23.09]Unlikely, yes.
[230:24.55]But this was her only hope.
[230:27.39]Thankfully, Father Spirit appears to have found a way.
[230:33.41]You know what's really funny about this?
[230:36.41]star was in this call like four hours ago and he said wouldn't it be funny if all the things that these octopus were saying was just how to beat the game and he he called it so yeah good job good for you now all we're missing is honor
[231:09.54]Honor, and then we can pull the thing off the crystal.
[231:17.96]That one was the... You know what I haven't been doing?
[231:22.83]Shit.
[231:23.53]I haven't been... Oh, no.
[231:25.29]Hold on.
[231:25.61]I gotta go back.
[231:28.15]I need to write down what the symbol was above that octopi head.
[231:36.95]Because I feel like I'm going to need to know that.
[231:47.86]So that one was the piece facing this way.
[231:53.57]As in that was hope.
[232:14.10]I didn't write down which one was above the one that was family, unfortunately.
[232:21.43]Shut up, bird!
[232:21.99]I wish I could move.
[232:39.09]Keep going.
[232:46.29]Didn't I already see this one, though?
[232:48.03]I must have missed one.
[232:55.19]No.
[232:55.61]Ah, come on.
[232:57.05]That's annoying.
[232:57.93]Pull me up.
[233:04.50]Pull me up.
[233:09.08]So I already... This is the one... Was this servitude?
[233:22.52]No.
[233:22.97]Okay.
[233:23.31]So this one is...
[233:25.36]What was this one?
[233:26.18]Was this family?
[233:26.70]There it is.
[233:27.08]Yep.
[233:27.20]Okay.
[233:27.60]I already got it.
[233:52.77]I just want to make sure I got it right.
[233:54.83]It's a square with sunshine.
[233:57.67]Alright.
[233:58.13]Sad square.
[233:58.83]I can now do that puzzle.
[234:33.37]Beam me back.
[234:36.22]Let's do it.
[234:42.18]Let's finish this up, huh?
[234:52.51]Alright.
[234:54.23]Servitude goes here.
[234:55.83]Servitude was the circle with the X.
[235:06.74]Where is it?
[235:09.76]Is that it?
[235:10.18]No.
[235:10.72]Which one was servitude?
[235:16.99]It was the one with the circles, right?
[235:22.41]Was it that one I was just on?
[235:23.27]Because that one, that's family.
[235:28.31]That's honor.
[235:31.51]That's hope.
[235:32.41]This one was servitude, right?
[235:39.28]I wrote it down like crazy.
[235:53.53]Wait, which one does it match up with?
[235:54.91]That one is hope.
[235:56.63]So that goes over here.
[236:01.63]Go there.
[236:05.03]Where is family?
[236:09.24]family goes there no wait yeah and honor goes there alright my servitude is like so screw I don't even know which one it is is it this one yeah
[236:40.15]And then we go back into this room.
[236:41.94]We pull the thing down so it gets down here as we get the power.
[236:44.94]Oh wait, where the fuck is Bigby?
[236:48.56]Okay, thank god.
[236:49.34]I don't even need him.
[236:50.38]Or do I?
[236:50.72]Alrighty.
[237:06.77]Whoa.
[237:20.59]Alright.
[237:22.33]Press the button.
[237:28.53]Oh, this is the... I wrote this down a long time ago.
[237:41.58]This is the shortest one.
[237:50.59]This one needs to be short.
[238:04.87]Oh no, I gotta go look at it again.
[238:06.25]It's like a weird accordion.
[238:22.18]That's not it.
[238:29.13]Didn't write this down good enough.
[238:34.76]Mind this is like teeth.
[238:37.22]Is it the other way?
[238:37.76]Maybe I went this way.
[238:51.98]um let's see how big they are sockets are deeper though I think I can I still look at it I'm pretty sure I can still look at it isn't it down it's in here right it was a Super Mario ship I remember but is there a way I can still see it
[239:37.33]There it is.
[239:37.79]Okay.
[239:41.21]The fat one goes at the end.
[239:42.36]And then it's just a nice straight line.
[239:48.52]Fat one goes at the end.
[239:56.20]At least I know that.
[239:56.92]Because now I can get it done.
[240:17.17]Fat one at the end.
[240:18.23]Let's get him in there and just take a look.
[240:34.35]So which one is the smallest one?
[240:39.53]This one, right?
[240:49.26]The one that's in here, the littlest, I think it's that.
[240:56.51]Not quite.
[241:05.93]Oh, that's in there deep, huh?
[241:14.38]You stay there.
[241:17.03]That's not small enough.
[241:19.39]That's too small.
[241:21.77]That's too small.
[241:23.05]That's not it either.
[241:23.81]I guess it was that one.
[241:28.21]I guess.
[241:43.08]Huh.
[241:44.18]Interesting.
[241:53.39]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[242:01.32]Hmm, why?
[242:05.09]This one has to be the smallest one.
[242:09.69]It's either that one or that one.
[242:12.27]Yeah, it has to be one of these two.
[242:15.84]Which one is smaller to those?
[242:21.25]I can't tell if those are exactly the same.
[242:22.73]I'm going to line this up.
[242:28.29]That one looks like a little bit lower.
[242:41.59]Huh.
[242:48.45]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[242:50.47]No.
[242:50.67]Is it flipped?
[242:51.51]Did I flip it?
[243:05.01]Oh, shit.
[243:06.63]Whoa.
[243:07.45]Okay.
[243:08.15]Alright.
[243:09.11]Well, that's a thing that exists.
[243:16.33]now to get this right oh boy let's just throw a bunch oh boy this is gonna be annoying
[243:42.05]So that one's, whatever one is the lowest here.
[243:44.33]So it looks like it's there.
[243:45.71]There, there, there, and there.
[243:51.39]Taminat, you have saved my daughter with your acts of servitude and honor.
[243:58.21]P has given you her Potonium Crystals, which will provide your planet with power for eternity.
[244:04.57]Thanks.
[244:04.78]Because you have shown yourself to be a true hero, I can now give you what you need to complete your journey.
[244:12.33]A way home.
[244:14.43]Activate Tower Transformation.
[244:35.00]Complete.
[244:37.06]Giant robot mobilized and ready for takeoff.
[244:39.78]Look at the count of birds.
[244:41.12]Count how many birds are there.
[244:42.40]Thank you.
[244:46.14]Aha, Tommy Knot.
[244:48.08]So you think you're a hero?
[244:50.22]Just wait till I blast you out.
[245:10.73]Get destroyed.
[245:15.87]Downvote done.
[245:22.93]Beaky.
[245:25.45]Oh, the dog.
[245:28.28]Hey, Tommy.
[245:31.18]I feel kind of funny.
[245:33.30]Beaky, you're alive.
[245:36.15]If by alive you mean hungry, then yeah, sure, I'm alive.
[245:40.80]Come on, little buddy.
[245:42.44]We're heading home.
[245:43.36]Mayday, mayday.
[245:46.40]Stuck in Sector 7, outside Darshan's orb.
[245:48.98]Mayday, mayday.
[245:51.76]What do you know?
[245:52.54]It's Numnoth.
[245:53.06]Mayday, mayday.
[245:55.93]Beak, beak.
[245:56.77]Change coordinates to Darshan's orb.
[246:00.65]Aye, aye, Captain.
[246:02.25]I've always wanted to say that.
[246:05.14]Look at that, like, big practical effect.
[246:15.89]Did I win?
[246:29.82]Darshan's orb?! !
[246:38.68]Yeah!
[246:46.62]No, that's not it.
[246:47.42]Don't forget about the secret at the end.
[246:49.59]I'm hearing like two songs at the same time here.
[247:00.12]There you go.
[247:00.56]Alright, options.
[247:07.17]Uh, save the game.
[247:09.41]Alright, well.
[247:12.71]Listen to all the music happening.
[247:16.85]The sad music and, like, the title theme playing at the same time.
[247:19.58]Let me, uh...
[247:40.32]Hold on a second.
[247:45.10]Alright.
[247:46.74]Well.
[247:49.38]So that was the game.
[247:52.08]Pretty short.
[247:53.62]It was about four hours or so.
[247:56.72]To beat the game.
[248:03.19]it was uh it was good that was fun that was interesting I I enjoyed that four hours I uh wish it was a little longer maybe like a part two kind of where you go to like a different planet or something but that was cool now we want to see the notebook um
[248:31.81]I'll tell you know what let's see can I take a couple pictures of this I don't even know what I did here I scribbled on this now these are my notes these will stay my notes forever yeah what did the the ant
[249:01.18]The Theodore Roosevelt ant.
[249:03.38]He didn't do anything, did he?
[249:04.92]I feel like there are some things that I missed.
[249:07.92]Right?
[249:09.34]Like, I feel like there are a couple things that I didn't do that could have added some time.
[249:24.86]Shit, that was Armikrog.
[249:31.90]What time is it?
[249:33.53]1030.
[249:33.85]Four hours.
[249:35.93]I really would have liked to have seen it be like six.
[249:39.09]I thought I said, alright.
[249:42.81]Like 10 would be like, well, that's that's way up there because the Neverhood wasn't even that long.
[249:47.36]The Neverhood was like maybe five or six, maybe total.
[249:51.96]It might have even been like the same.
[249:53.49]And I just don't remember.
[250:00.51]But I mean, they did what they could.
[250:02.45]It was only a team of like three or four people, I think, that put almost 90% of that game together.
[250:08.21]So it's pretty impressive because it was just a Kickstarter kind of game.
[250:13.56]So hats off to the guys that could put all that animation work and all that design work together in a little under a year, I think.
[250:20.46]A year and like some odd months.
[250:25.36]Would I have liked to have seen it go on for like another hour or two?
[250:27.86]Yes, absolutely.
[250:30.27]But it was what it was, and I thought it was fun.
[250:39.64]So... Two hours of me trying to explain the notebook.
[250:46.92]Yeah, they did.
[250:47.70]I'll give them a round of applause for their accomplishment, because that was pretty damn cool.
[250:56.13]Am I going to make any YouTube videos out of these streams?
[250:59.27]Mmm...
[251:00.87]Probably not.
[251:04.47]Maybe I would make eventually like a playlist and upload highlights or something.
[251:16.06]Oh boy, I'm starving though.
[251:20.80]End credits.
[251:21.28]There probably was something at the end.
[251:22.08]I probably should have watched the whole thing.
[251:25.69]But that was an indie game.
[251:26.86]I think that it was just over, just under, I think, a million dollars.
[251:33.84]And for what the game actually was, for all that work and all that shit that had to go into it, like $900,000 is not a lot of money when you're making an entire game in claymation.
[251:45.93]So that was cool.
[251:50.34]Considering the fact that I played Broken Age, and Broken Age was just about, like, three hours long.
[251:57.15]And that game took in, like, millions of dollars, didn't it?
[252:00.53]And that game was, like, a 2D, like, hand-drawn game.
[252:05.50]So all the guys at Pencil Test, and, like, Doug TenNapel, and, you know, all the guys that worked on the game.
[252:11.68]Very, very nice job.
[252:13.96]I much enjoyed that.
[252:26.08]And with that, that's going to wrap it up.
[252:30.60]I'm actually kind of glad I got the whole thing done in one stream.
[252:32.94]That's kind of cool.
[252:36.01]When my name just popped up out of nowhere, that was crazy.
[252:44.13]I'm actually surprised that that was just in there.
[252:47.07]I know that because obviously I was a huge Neverhood fan and a huge Earthworm Gin fan.
[252:52.56]So I gave enough money, I think, to be put somewhere in a game somewhere.
[252:59.64]And that took me off guard.
[253:00.86]That was funny.
[253:03.38]But yeah, games are very expensive.
[253:04.42]Very, very expensive.
[253:06.89]Very expensive.
[253:09.11]Now, if Pencil Test got like $10 million or like $20, $30 million from a studio, yeah, then it probably would have been like an eight-hour long game with a bunch more stuff going on.
[253:19.76]But that was an independent game.
[253:24.48]But yeah, I think I'm going to take off.
[253:26.22]I'm starving.
[253:28.18]I was hungry when I started the stream.
[253:29.44]Even like two or three hours into the stream, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like really, really, really hungry.
[253:35.11]Hold on.
[253:35.41]Let me just get to the right page here.
[253:36.75]You want to see?
[253:37.47]I'm going to tear out some of these pages.
[253:48.33]You guys want to like see?
[253:50.25]Here's like one of the pages.
[253:51.48]Actually, let me see if I can even turn on my webcam.
[253:58.06]Is it even connected?
[253:58.80]Oh, let's see.
[254:07.03]Can I add?
[254:18.82]Okay, did it work?
[254:20.58]So here's the page.
[254:21.77]Here's the page.
[254:22.33]You want to see?
[254:23.45]Are we here?
[254:25.59]Hey, look at Servitude Family Hope.
[254:30.22]I remember these symbols.
[254:31.44]We're going to write those down.
[254:32.62]There you go.
[254:35.80]This is one of my notebook pages.
[254:50.49]It was before that, anyway.
[254:58.14]Yeah, there's all this stuff.
[254:59.24]That's funny.
[255:04.62]Alright, guys.
[255:11.52]Well, that's just one.
[255:12.64]I have four other pages, but we don't need to see those.
[255:14.89]We don't need to see my awful, awful handwriting.
[255:20.90]But yeah, I'll talk to you guys later.
[255:24.28]Take care.
[255:26.34]Hope you enjoyed the stream.
[255:28.34]I will be around probably the next couple days.
[255:30.42]I'll probably stream something.
[255:32.79]But yeah, I'm off.
[255:34.45]Take it easy, guys.
[255:36.37]Good night.
[255:37.27]Thanks if you've stuck around the whole time.
[255:39.95]Thanks.
[255:40.35]Cool.

[255:43.39]You can get it right now.
[255:44.45]I believe it's $19.99 or $20, $25.
