[01:02.17]Oh, god damn it.
[01:05.37]I accidentally pressed the start streaming button.
[01:09.77]I was sitting here, I was drinking my coffee, I was getting ready for the day, I had a couple errands to run, and I clicked on the wrong button.
[01:17.55]And here we are.
[01:20.01]Well, you know what?
[01:21.20]I'm a man of my word.
[01:22.58]I'm a man of my actions.
[01:25.08]We're gonna stay on.
[01:26.70]Fuck it.
[01:27.70]Def- whoops.
[01:31.87]I'm a man of my action.
[01:35.66]I tweeted that to make sure you guys know.
[01:38.84]EU friendly stream.
[01:39.54]We're going to do an EU friendly stream.
[01:41.08]We do one of these every three months.
[01:42.80]Surprise stream.
[01:46.73]We're also going to play Deadly Premonition.
[01:51.85]Yeah.
[01:53.37]I don't know why.
[01:53.92]I just decided it was going to be this.
[01:55.32]This was the day we were going to try to play this game.
[01:59.25]I heard this game is awful.
[02:00.87]I heard this game is really good.
[02:02.65]Uh, funny story.
[02:04.20]You know, let's wait.
[02:04.96]Let's wait.
[02:05.64]Let's wait till people get here.
[02:07.56]Let's just have a discussion about, um... I don't know.
[02:11.74]Dunkachinos.
[02:13.90]You guys ever had a Dunkachino before?
[02:16.34]Life-changing.
[02:17.94]You will never be the same for the rest of your life.
[02:23.53]It's got great amounts of cream.
[02:25.17]Great amounts of... Cocoa.
[02:31.65]Good stuff.
[02:33.71]Yep.
[02:36.65]Every game made by Suda51.
[02:39.79]Is this a Suda51 game?
[02:43.75]I thought this was a... I was about to go grab the box, but I bought this on Steam.
[02:49.89]Are we going to get over it later?
[02:54.41]No.
[02:55.69]Maybe if I'm feeling antsy, you might see Get Over It, but I don't think you will.
[03:00.02]I'm going to be real with you.
[03:02.03]Dunkachino is real?
[03:02.95]Yeah, do the dunkadunkadunkadunkadunkachino.
[03:07.99]Asking Europeans about American food in American restaurants.
[03:14.14]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[03:17.56]This is supposed to be an EU-friendly stream.
[03:19.30]Wow, shit, boys.
[03:22.28]We're still talking about chips then?
[03:25.08]You know what I love?
[03:25.58]The fucking prawn chips.
[03:28.21]What is it?
[03:28.69]The Pringles are only available in some parts of England.
[03:33.57]They're the fucking prawn chips.
[03:36.71]What is it?
[03:37.17]Shrimp prawn.
[03:37.91]What's the prawn chips that everybody loves in England?
[03:44.00]Crisps.
[03:45.10]What are they?
[03:49.48]Prawn cocktail.
[03:50.20]There it is.
[03:50.52]Prawn cocktail.
[03:51.14]Don't you haha me.
[03:52.96]That was a jokey... I'm not going to get haha'd in my stream right now.
[03:56.24]It's prawn cocktail.
[04:07.91]Getting fucking haha'd.
[04:10.01]Stream's been on for five minutes and already I'm getting haha'd.
[04:12.73]Come on, guys.
[04:16.03]What is this?
[04:16.49]What are you... What...
[04:19.34]Because I did like a shitty accent all of a sudden.
[04:22.44]We're doing ha-has.
[04:26.84]I didn't know the EU crowd was this demanding.
[04:30.87]I didn't know the EU crowd was this on my ass about jokes.
[04:39.37]Anyways, let's talk about this game.
[04:44.88]Never doing an EU stream ever again, apparently.
[04:52.65]What's the weather?
[04:54.55]What's the weather?
[04:55.01]Weather is cold.
[04:56.37]Been snowing here recently.
[04:59.95]Feels bad.
[05:01.43]I'm just kidding.
[05:02.01]I'm just joking.
[05:03.29]I love you Europeans.
[05:06.55]And Asians.
[05:07.87]And... What do they call it?
[05:11.55]Australians.
[05:12.35]Who's awake right now?
[05:14.11]Is Asia awake right now?
[05:15.97]What time is it in Asia right now?
[05:18.11]This is an Asia-friendly stream, I think.
[05:26.24]Fairly certain.
[05:32.71]I'm awake.
[05:35.65]Asia's pretty big.
[05:36.55]How many time zones are in Asia?
[05:40.15]Eight?
[05:43.45]It's a continent, dude.
[05:47.02]Well, how many time zones are in there?
[05:49.54]Seven?
[05:49.96]There's seven time zones?
[05:52.20]I was taking a wild guess.
[05:55.07]So this full... I was getting fucking... I was getting dated.
[06:00.96]Anywho, thank you Mostly Lost for the $1.
[06:02.42]I was about to have a productive Monday.
[06:05.18]Damn.
[06:07.06]Keep me out of the background.
[06:09.96]It's still a productive day.
[06:13.76]Moifity, thanks for the $10.
[06:14.98]EU-friendly stream.
[06:16.80]Take my bits.
[06:17.52]Love you, man.
[06:17.96]Well, love you too, Moifity.
[06:19.94]Thank you for the $10.
[06:20.75]Much appreciated.
[06:23.56]European.
[06:24.65]From the EU, apparently.
[06:27.19]Wetrix300, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[06:28.73]An EU-friendly stream.
[06:30.11]Cheers to that.
[06:31.01]You got it, Dunkachino.
[06:35.71]PeacefulHaley, thanks for the 25 cents.
[06:37.17]And DCMurphy, thanks for the 25 cents as well.
[06:40.37]And Haley says, tomorrow's my 20th birthday.
[06:43.19]I can't really believe it.
[06:45.03]No one else can either.
[06:47.01]No one else can enter the always.
[06:49.66]My brain is... No one else can...
[06:54.57]Why is Twitch Alerts screwing up this donation here?
[07:00.21]It says, I look way younger than I am.
[07:02.09]I'm sure you understand this feeling.
[07:03.15]I also have a good day.
[07:05.37]Well, happy belated birthday, can't we?
[07:11.72]Sometimes I can't read.
[07:14.42]But, happy birthday.
[07:16.24]So, we're gonna play Deadly Premonition.
[07:17.41]We're gonna start now.
[07:18.55]I'm just gonna move it over here.
[07:19.41]I'm gonna turn off the intro.
[07:20.39]Go ahead and get it over here.
[07:22.15]Uh, this game, if you don't know, is, has a very, very interesting accolade.
[07:30.95]It is, uh, the most polarizing, the most polarized reviewed game of all time.
[07:37.52]At least in the survival horror genre.
[07:40.51]Every critic.
[07:41.17]This game is in the Guinness Book of World Records because of just how all over the place the reviews are of this game.
[07:49.53]Half the people said this is the worst game they've ever played.
[07:52.75]Half the people said this game was a 10 out of 10.
[07:55.90]And it's the Director's Cut.
[08:00.84]That's true.
[08:01.24]Look it up.
[08:02.76]Whoa!
[08:04.46]Whoa!
[08:05.20]Thanks for the $50!
[08:05.80]Thank you, Time96, for the 50 bucks.
[08:11.39]Coming in with a big drop.
[08:15.64]Hey, Jeremy, big fan.
[08:16.64]Hey, Jeremy, big fan.
[08:17.50]Love your streams.
[08:18.40]Gives pleasure.
[08:19.28]Is that a meme?
[08:22.76]You dropping a meme already?
[08:25.56]Thank you, Tim.
[08:27.06]Tim.
[08:27.56]All right.
[08:27.88]Thank you.
[08:28.14]I'm going to call you Tim.
[08:30.37]That's loud.
[08:33.95]How sweet the sound.
[08:39.74]No one knows the rest of those lyrics except for the first two words.
[08:46.88]Find me a fucking person that knows the rest of the words to this song.
[08:55.12]And I'll pay you two dollars tonight.
[09:05.37]Ow.
[09:06.64]I want to hear another story.
[09:08.17]Pay me.
[09:11.01]Yes, of course.
[09:14.27]You've been waiting a long time for this.
[09:17.57]Shitty old man to start off with.
[09:18.83]How about a special one?
[09:21.54]This story is very strange and very nasty, but somewhat nostalgic.
[09:30.35]Do you think you can be a good girl and listen all the way to the end?
[09:36.14]All the way to the end?
[09:37.24]Is it a scary story?
[09:38.26]Yes, it's quite scary.
[09:41.64]But it's also a very important story.
[09:46.80]That's clearly somebody breaking leaves in their hand.
[09:50.74]I can tell you a different story.
[09:52.81]No, I want to hear it.
[09:56.07]Somebody's just cooking bacon.
[09:57.99]I won't be scared.
[09:59.17]That's not a fire.
[10:00.41]Will you turn on the TV?
[10:02.15]I got to drop some of this audio.
[10:03.74]Leave the sound down.
[10:06.76]Drop the sound, please.
[10:08.40]I agree.
[10:13.00]Now, listen.
[10:15.27]This is important.
[10:17.47]At times, we must purge things from this world.
[10:23.35]Sorry, I can't change it right now.
[10:24.59]You should not exist.
[10:27.53]Even if it means losing someone that you love.
[10:30.12]Thank you, Time, for the $50.
[10:31.06]Much appreciated.
[10:33.98]Also, TatoSeal, thanks for the $1.
[10:35.82]Your content's been making me cry laugh for years.
[10:39.45]I have a nerve disorder, so the laughter you cause is medicine to me.
[10:42.63]Well... If I can bring you any... What the fuck is going on right now?
[10:51.36]Much love to you, Teito.
[10:55.65]What the hell is going on?
[11:01.39]We're in New York?
[11:02.43]York, move, run.
[11:09.05]Alright, there's a run.
[11:09.77]We got two weird angels.
[11:12.93]There's a talk and an observe.
[11:14.25]What does observe do?
[11:15.35]Let's watch.
[11:16.01]Let's hear what this person has to say.
[11:20.27]No, this is just an internal monologue.
[11:21.94]Alright, what's over here?
[11:23.86]When AY is displayed on screen, act as A observe.
[11:26.12]Yeah, okay.
[11:27.02]That's what I figured.
[11:29.80]A doll shaped like a fat man has a plate on it which reads Washington State.
[11:35.00]Okay.
[11:39.09]So why do you all like this game again?
[11:41.84]That's not fair.
[11:43.28]That's not fair.
[11:45.82]I literally just turned it on and I'm already like, wait, why do you guys like this?
[11:52.06]Nobody told me they liked this.
[11:53.24]I just implanted that.
[11:57.58]Alright, I'm ready.
[12:05.52]It's about time to get started.
[12:08.54]So this game's dumb.
[12:10.50]I'm already over it.
[12:11.18]I'm getting a call.
[12:21.91]I see I'm playing the best game.
[12:25.04]I really don't want to talk over cutscenes, but... Can you hear me?
[12:28.90]It's me.
[12:30.14]You're
[12:32.46]You know, I really was getting deja vu from the beginning there.
[12:35.56]That is that Lucifer game.
[12:37.64]That little kid Lucifer game.
[12:38.80]That's like the beginning.
[12:41.00]Wait, I have to answer?
[12:41.68]Is this like... Does it mean something if I don't do it?
[12:45.73]Perfect shot.
[12:46.21]That's going to be on the green.
[12:48.51]I thought you went to sleep.
[12:50.61]One putt will take that into the hole.
[12:52.47]Don't be surprised.
[12:54.73]A crime took place out in the country this time.
[12:58.81]Let's take it slow.
[13:01.18]Okay, Zack?
[13:06.29]Lucius, there it is.
[13:08.21]Wait!
[13:09.27]Stop it!
[13:10.49]My ears are forever ruined.
[13:13.26]My ears are... Oh my fucking god.
[13:31.93]I wish I could pay attention to this.
[13:34.01]I turned down the audio, too.
[13:35.87]Nice director's cut.
[13:37.34]Did you add more sound effects?
[13:38.42]You gotta be kidding me.
[14:00.82]How do I get rid of this?
[14:02.68]You've got to be kidding me.
[14:05.02]That is white noise.
[14:06.19]That's static in my ear.
[14:08.01]I turned it down for you guys, but holy shit.
[14:09.85]I can't even have the earpiece in my ear.
[14:13.97]Eating almonds?
[14:14.37]These almonds are going to make me real healthy.
[14:16.67]Those Omega-3s.
[14:31.10]Those weren't drugs.
[14:31.66]Are those police cigarettes?
[14:32.64]Police cigarettes.
[14:33.16]He is talking to himself.
[14:57.66]Don't you agree, Zack?
[14:59.40]So I have like split personality- The game is cutting me off.
[15:09.26]I can't even talk over it.
[15:15.93]What in my- What the fuck is happening?
[15:21.81]Why?
[15:22.91]What?
[15:29.02]That was a chimpanzee.
[15:31.00]Ow, my fucking ear.
[15:36.56]God.
[15:42.28]All right.
[15:46.56]Yeah, why wouldn't you just hit the brakes?
[15:49.00]You don't have to go 100 miles per hour.
[15:51.56]In fact, that is a very much a brake scenario.
[15:55.81]Maybe if I step on the gas, I'll be able to drive through the trees.
[15:59.93]Smart.
[16:08.50]Dude, I hope there's no Bitcoin on that laptop.
[16:12.02]Otherwise, I'm losing quite a lot of money.
[16:15.06]Am I going to get control of the game right now?
[16:28.31]What the fuck man?
[16:29.33]Give me like the control of the game.
[16:30.97]I'm sitting there smoking cigarettes.
[16:36.43]Crypto.
[16:37.90]You know what I... Yes, I want to say.
[16:39.58]But first of all, let me... You know what I heard somebody said?
[16:42.81]uh maybe some maybe maybe I said this I don't remember did I say this I don't remember so if like somebody else said this like give them credit but like I'm gonna say this right now like crypto is the new vegan like you gotta tell everybody about it I have to tell you no matter who the fuck you are I gotta talk to you about fucking bitcoin I gotta talk to you about ethereum I I need to make sure you know that I'm into cryptocurrency it's the new vegan
[17:11.23]I'm sorry.
[17:11.73]I'm sorry.
[17:13.25]I'm a coin vegan.
[17:14.25]I'm sorry.
[17:18.88]Let me turn this down.
[17:22.36]Save it.
[17:26.86]How long does the game take to save?
[17:35.27]Did the game save?
[17:38.05]Or did the game crash?
[17:40.73]Still getting audio.
[17:41.27]I believe that's it.
[17:45.98]I believe that we have to start it over.
[17:47.20]Because the game is hanging, I think.
[17:52.66]I don't think I got to save it, and I don't think we can skip that fucking cutscene.
[17:57.88]Alright, I'd like to show you something here, if I may.
[18:02.11]I'm going to give you a screenshot because what the fuck is this?
[18:06.76]Why would this... This doesn't make any sense.
[18:11.98]Just give me one moment here.
[18:14.12]This is currently on my screen right now.
[18:22.72]Let's go ahead and save this.
[18:28.77]Right there, that's fine.
[18:33.06]Let's show you what this is.
[18:35.92]Somebody explain to me what the fuck this means.
[18:43.95]That's on my desktop right now.
[18:48.05]Save failed.
[18:49.75]Win save.
[18:50.73]Save failed.
[18:58.63]Is this like one of those Kojima games?
[19:01.82]With like Psycho Mantis that kind of makes fun of you for a minute and then you have to plug the controller in.
[19:06.82]It has to be, right?
[19:09.64]Alright, I pressed okay.
[19:10.48]Let's see what happens.
[19:16.97]Okay.
[19:19.47]Flashlight on and off.
[19:23.14]Is it just that crash?
[19:27.10]That's run.
[19:28.04]Can I do anything with the car?
[19:29.28]No.
[19:32.14]I got $30 for picking up the agent badge.
[19:34.06]Nice.
[19:37.93]Don't really need that.
[19:39.35]I don't give a shit about secrets, guys.
[19:41.63]Let's make that really clear.
[19:42.59]Steel pipe.
[19:43.69]Take item.
[19:45.17]You got a steel pipe.
[19:47.25]I'm going to bash somebody's head in with this.
[19:48.95]How do I use it?
[19:53.05]Looks like it was hidden in a gun.
[19:57.37]No.
[19:58.11]No gun?
[19:59.13]Put item away.
[19:59.91]Take item out.
[20:03.25]There's nothing in here.
[20:03.99]This is my box?
[20:08.06]Weapon.
[20:09.40]Item.
[20:10.82]No, I have like a... I want to keep this.
[20:12.24]I have a gun.
[20:13.26]How do I equip this stuff?
[20:14.77]What is this?
[20:15.23]Why is it telling me how to... What is this?
[20:16.55]That's where you store things.
[20:19.97]Can I get to a menu where I can equip something?
[20:24.16]Alright, here's the menu.
[20:25.96]What the fuck?
[20:27.86]Alright, weapon.
[20:29.70]Put... No, I want to put the pipe on.
[20:31.91]That looks good.
[20:33.89]Equip.
[20:36.35]Is it on?
[20:39.89]No, no, no, no.
[20:40.39]It's equipped.
[20:42.27]It would have been nice if somebody could tell me that the game told me how to do that.
[20:46.39]Alright, let's go.
[20:53.37]That's not the right way.
[20:56.44]Is there like a crouch?
[20:59.82]That has to be the right way.
[21:01.76]Is there a climb through fence?
[21:05.80]I tripped over the fire.
[21:07.90]Whoops.
[21:10.09]Watch out for that fire.
[21:19.91]I very clearly have to go this way.
[21:21.29]So why can I not go over this?
[21:23.54]Break it.
[21:24.31]How do I attack?
[21:26.85]What is the attack button?
[21:30.67]Pressing R2?
[21:39.34]What is smash?
[21:41.00]How do I smash gate?
[21:47.66]Hey Zach, there's a path up ahead in the headlights.
[21:49.44]Must be years since I last set foot on a dirt path.
[21:53.50]Yeah.
[21:57.02]Yeah.
[21:59.68]There is a dirt path here.
[22:08.49]How do I get through this?
[22:14.38]Let me smash the gate!
[22:16.88]Stop putting it away!
[22:19.44]What the fuck?
[22:20.18]Oh my...
[22:21.74]Oh my lord.
[22:22.42]Okay, it's- okay.
[22:23.88]It's RB and LB to swing.
[22:28.96]That took a long time.
[22:40.82]It's Pokemon all over again.
[22:42.64]I got a- I got a first fight in the game.
[22:45.34]Start profiling.
[22:48.98]What?
[22:53.87]Is this supposed to be inside of my head?
[22:55.27]I don't have to whammy stop this.
[23:05.58]Extra for profiling.
[23:11.40]I just played a game show in my own head.
[23:16.00]I hear a dog.
[23:16.48]Is that a dog or a cat?
[23:18.77]The lighting looks ages old.
[23:20.09]We're off the path now, but things aren't looking much better.
[23:23.59]I'm just waiting to get attacked by the fucking zombie dog that's gonna jump around the corner.
[23:26.97]I hear it in the distance.
[23:31.44]Yep, I hear it.
[23:35.42]Where is it?
[23:36.08]Where is it?
[23:39.66]This dog is singing a song.
[23:45.72]And there's blood.
[23:51.92]Oh no!
[23:54.52]It just died.
[23:55.96]I could have gotten there faster.
[23:57.54]Well, maybe not.
[24:02.14]It's the dog's mean.
[24:07.91]Villain Disney dog.
[24:11.55]So much for my hopes for a peaceful picnic.
[24:13.29]Do me a favor and stay sharp, Zach.
[24:16.61]You got it.
[24:17.03]More breakable fence?
[24:21.21]No, we don't want to use that.
[24:27.28]Zumbini?
[24:32.02]I could have saved it if I broke the fence quicker.
[24:36.85]That is just not true.
[24:39.01]I'm not going to believe that.
[24:40.07]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[24:41.59]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[24:42.79]What was that?
[24:43.15]What was the flash for?
[24:48.22]Is it in the... Stuck in the building?
[24:49.88]Is she right here?
[24:51.46]Where the fuck is this enemy?
[24:52.62]Because I don't understand.
[24:54.95]I'm getting audio cues and this enemy's not here.
[25:02.64]Okay, well.
[25:06.64]Can of pickles.
[25:09.26]Take it.
[25:14.56]In the corner or anything?
[25:16.67]By the way, these sound...
[25:19.92]This text appearing on the screen audio reminds me of a Super Nintendo burp Clearly that's what happens when somebody drinks like a bunch of beer at a bar in an SNES RPG like this I feel like an earthbound when you're in the end and you go talk to one of the random patrons.
[25:38.68]That's what you hear What is this?
[25:44.78]Turn off observe That was a long one
[25:49.66]A control panel for the power grid.
[25:51.12]This should give us the electricity we need.
[25:52.82]Not an expert opinion though.
[25:56.58]Turn it on.
[25:59.50]Looks like that's where we need to go.
[26:13.43]Alright, first enemy.
[26:19.01]How fast are the enemies?
[26:20.13]Do I need to use a gun?
[26:22.09]Are bullets scarce?
[26:25.01]Is a lead pipe enough to kill an enemy?
[26:28.32]We'll find out.
[26:30.50]In about 15 seconds.
[26:32.38]No, I guess we have to use the gun.
[26:33.82]She's gonna do the crab walk, the backwards horror movie crab walk.
[26:37.56]Yes she is.
[26:38.84]She's gonna make a bridge with her arms and crawl at me.
[26:41.04]No, she's not even gonna go that far.
[26:46.72]What did I get?
[26:52.17]Do I need to shoot this person?
[26:54.29]Equip weapon and draw it with LB, and draw weapon and aim with R. Draw weapon and look with RT.
[27:02.49]And then... it's... okay.
[27:04.01]Did I get her?
[27:12.56]Alright, she's dead.
[27:14.68]Alright.
[27:15.58]Hooray!
[27:16.16]Are there more?
[27:21.69]Is that aiming?
[27:22.29]Oh, it is.
[27:24.15]It's not fun.
[27:25.33]There is more.
[27:30.29]Does that guy have a long neck?
[27:32.61]Is that his head or is that a piece of hair?
[27:35.29]Oh, that's a hair.
[27:35.85]Okay, I thought this guy had long hair.
[27:37.47]Thank God they give you plenty of time to do their stupid entrance music thing.
[27:45.86]Yes.
[27:46.82]Great.
[27:48.16]Yeah, great.
[27:50.52]I really am glad I get their entrance titantron going down the alleyway.
[27:56.06]Where is it?
[27:56.80]I hear somebody else.
[28:01.02]First aid kit.
[28:03.67]Yes.
[28:11.51]Reload it.
[28:12.27]Make sure it's all reloaded.
[28:13.21]Wait, you need to collect keys?
[28:14.43]Somebody behind me.
[28:20.48]Yeah, everyone's doing the limbo.
[28:22.00]Amazing.
[28:26.56]Got him.
[28:29.99]The latest limbo competition.
[28:33.13]Get some money.
[28:33.61]Do you buy things in the game?
[28:37.97]Can't see much through this fog.
[28:39.21]This path might be blocked in the rain.
[28:40.57]We just stay away from this obvious danger.
[28:45.82]Is this a meme game?
[28:46.72]It might be.
[28:49.37]I don't know much about it, all I know is that it is a video game that we're currently going to play for at least a little while.
[28:55.97]You have infinite ammo, shoot like crazy.
[29:00.45]Profiling start.
[29:01.23]Do I have to select it?
[29:05.42]I don't get it.
[29:14.73]That one takes the cake.
[29:16.21]It's the first time I've been attacked so directly.
[29:19.90]Zach, can you give me a logical explanation about what that was?
[29:25.58]It's me, I'm Zach.
[29:26.00]I'm Zach.
[29:26.22]Thank you so much, Ben, for the 50 bucks.
[29:35.31]This is one of those non-alt-tappable games, because I will crash it.
[29:39.27]So I'll get to the bits when I have a moment.
[29:41.25]But thank you so much, dude.
[29:42.75]Thank you, everybody, that's been giving any money.
[29:46.15]I will hit you guys up shortly.
[29:47.71]Lollipop.
[29:49.57]That's a lollipop, dude.
[29:53.81]Yeah, it is an early stream, though.
[29:56.05]Today.
[29:56.37]It's an early stream today.
[29:58.13]Save point.
[29:58.65]Fuck, is this gonna happen again?
[29:59.67]Yeah, it's gonna happen again.
[30:06.71]I'm not going to be able to save the game one time.
[30:11.15]What you see is what you get today, guys.
[30:17.16]Great director's cut.
[30:24.38]Why early stream?
[30:25.37]Because I'm awake.
[30:27.65]And I haven't done one of these in a long time.
[30:35.29]I see you like playing 1-2-Switch.
[30:39.61]Apparently the fix is to make a save data folder manually in the game's directory.
[30:43.60]Is that going to cause a problem mid-game?
[30:51.20]Aren't you usually awake by noon?
[30:53.10]Yeah, but what I meant by that is I'm like alert.
[30:56.27]Takes me like seven hours to be alert.
[30:59.49]Is anybody else like that?
[31:01.48]Let's say I get up at 8 o'clock in the morning, right?
[31:04.12]Somebody said I could shoot a million bullets, right?
[31:06.32]Were they lying?
[31:08.61]Amazing.
[31:13.19]But anyway, so let's say I wake up at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[31:16.96]It takes me until like 4 o'clock in the afternoon to be completely alert and awake.
[31:25.13]Doesn't matter if I drink coffee.
[31:26.83]Does not matter.
[31:27.81]I could take caffeine.
[31:29.63]I could get a good night's sleep.
[31:31.10]I could get full rest.
[31:32.28]Nope.
[31:33.86]That shit don't matter.
[31:34.74]This guy's blocking.
[31:37.04]I need some drain fluid.
[31:49.15]Steel pipe.
[31:50.79]Toolbox that shit.
[31:55.48]That's where my classes are.
[31:56.78]I do like the money collection aspect.
[32:02.38]It's fun.
[32:05.88]I woke up at 4am.
[32:12.48]I get groggy.
[32:13.48]I get real groggy.
[32:20.50]I wake up with like stuffy nose and...
[32:23.43]Whoa, hold on, I gotta do my acting motion before I attack you!
[32:28.23]Great.
[32:29.79]Extra for enemies killed.
[32:32.99]So what happens if you don't kill enemies?
[32:36.20]Can you just run by everybody?
[32:37.24]I'm assuming you probably can.
[32:42.34]I just did it.
[32:42.84]Am I gonna get a video game point detriment for not doing that right?
[32:52.22]Hey, pro tip.
[32:53.60]That sideways eight next to your bullet count implies you can shoot as many as you want.
[32:58.28]Is that what that is?
[33:00.83]Is that what that thing is?
[33:04.99]Ah, I thought that was just a pretzel.
[33:07.07]I thought that was like a switch between handgun and pretzel.
[33:09.69]And that was my health.
[33:11.81]Ah, thanks for the tip.
[33:23.66]Push this out of the way.
[33:28.57]Fucking got him.
[33:32.01]That exploded.
[33:35.55]So what is the top?
[33:36.15]The top left my health.
[33:37.22]What do the two health mean?
[33:38.12]Is it health and stamina?
[33:39.00]I don't get it.
[33:39.48]Is that health and blood pressure?
[33:41.68]Right in the butt.
[33:52.42]So, the question I have for you guys is how... Uh, how much longer do I have to walk on a bridge and shoot the same enemy?
[33:59.51]You know what I'm saying?
[34:03.07]I ain't complaining yet.
[34:04.25]I'm just saying, like, how long do I have to shoot the same guy?
[34:07.01]Yeah, the same KILL ME enemy until I get to play the game.
[34:11.63]Is this the game?
[34:14.03]It's more like stress than stamina.
[34:19.10]You got machine broken by an axe.
[34:23.46]the second key.
[34:26.51]I feel like I shouldn't be doing this every time.
[34:33.54]I clearly saw a hamburger there.
[34:36.12]I love how this is- I'm like inside my own mind here.
[34:39.08]And as well as all the stuff with the- all the fucking crazy murders and shit that's going through my mind.
[34:45.67]Still gotta think about lunch.
[34:47.33]I love how like lunch and dinner just like pops up there.
[34:50.19]That's- I love it.
[34:51.35]Let's try to fix it.
[34:52.07]Let's find a way to fix this shit.
[34:54.13]I got the fuse box.
[34:59.88]Okay.
[35:00.06]Do I have to like-
[35:03.22]Do I have to do anything with the fuse box?
[35:04.46]Okay, items.
[35:12.85]Looks like nothing is broken.
[35:14.05]Since it's the same model, I think I can fix it.
[35:15.83]Okay.
[35:17.67]I don't know how to fix it.
[35:28.29]I'm overthinking this game.
[35:29.40]It's very simple.
[35:31.74]I got money for observing that shit.
[35:34.90]Okay.
[35:39.30]I'll just keep moving.
[35:44.08]Yes!
[35:46.18]Let's go.
[35:48.66]The main character is 5'8", like you.
[35:50.58]And check out how tall he looks.
[35:55.49]He's a pretty averagely tall person.
[35:58.23]And I shoot the lock off.
[35:59.36]It is a survival horror game.
[36:00.56]This has to be able to be shot off.
[36:02.16]I guarantee it.
[36:02.92]You want to put my money where my mouth is here?
[36:06.14]I guarantee this comes off when I shoot it.
[36:10.40]That's a fucking guarantee in a survival horror game.
[36:17.97]I'm doing this joke again.
[36:19.01]What do you mean we're doing this joke?
[36:20.85]Bet my Bitcoin I would have... Where?
[36:24.61]There you are.
[36:32.16]But he didn't say headshot.
[36:34.40]He very well may have, though.
[36:37.11]Obviously, I gotta put that in here.
[36:38.67]I guess.
[36:41.93]Looks like nothing's broken.
[36:42.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:43.99]Put it in there.
[36:44.83]Put it in the microwave.
[36:46.57]Set it for two minutes.
[36:48.10]And you've got four hot dogs.
[36:50.94]And some spaghetti.
[36:53.84]Mmm!
[36:56.36]Power in the area should be more stable now.
[36:58.14]Let's hurry ahead, Zack.
[37:02.32]Hey, what do you say, Zack?
[37:11.60]Is there another door in there that I could have gone in?
[37:16.36]No, I think I can just walk through.
[37:18.30]Headshot.
[37:21.24]Headshot.
[37:21.68]Got him.
[37:21.92]Move that out of the way.
[37:26.36]And thank you for playing the tutorial.
[37:28.04]You now win.
[37:29.68]Who eats spaghetti with hot dogs?
[37:31.05]Are you out of your mind?
[37:31.81]A lot of people do.
[37:34.87]Hot dogs and beans.
[37:36.53]Hot dog and spaghetti.
[37:39.77]You guys have never... What do you... Spaghetti-o's.
[37:41.83]You guys have never had spaghetti-o's?
[37:44.23]You'd put chunks of hot dog in the spaghetti-o's?
[37:47.91]Nobody did that.
[37:49.03]Wow.
[37:49.57]Are you kidding me?
[37:51.32]I don't believe that for a second.
[37:54.14]Bullseye.
[37:54.54]Bullseye.
[37:55.62]Amazing.
[38:00.83]Okay, this guy.
[38:02.19]That guy's moving too fast.
[38:03.23]He's moving extra steps.
[38:04.51]That's not fair.
[38:07.53]I've done that before.
[38:08.31]Everybody has.
[38:12.33]This shooting camera.
[38:13.51]Don't ever shoot anything that's to the left of you, guy.
[38:16.61]You'll miss it every time.
[38:21.12]Okay, what the fuck is that shit?
[38:24.08]That really is so annoying.
[38:25.20]I don't like the fact that they get those extra steps.
[38:28.74]That's not cool.
[38:32.05]Yes, this is Jay.
[38:32.93]What's up?
[38:33.29]Shibby!
[38:33.77]Shibby!
[38:37.15]Hey, Shibby.
[38:37.81]Yeah, it is an early morning.
[38:40.89]We're playing Deadly Inquisitor.
[38:45.27]Can't go through the fog.
[38:46.00]Can't go this way.
[38:46.56]Go.
[38:51.62]This guy impresses himself.
[38:53.50]I didn't have to do anything.
[38:55.60]I just looked at you and you died.
[38:56.72]Huh.
[39:00.71]I just gave him the blue steel and he died.
[39:03.87]Why can I not get this?
[39:12.77]All it took was blue steel and I Zoolanded him.
[39:22.80]Come on, give me that one.
[39:25.82]I'm allowed to have three bad jokes every spring.
[39:30.95]That's how it works.
[39:32.13]I get my bad joke quota.
[39:34.38]Uh-oh!
[39:36.00]Boss fight!
[39:37.02]What?
[39:40.32]That was not a long time.
[39:41.52]I don't know if there are quick time events in this game.
[39:46.52]I gotta be ready.
[39:47.96]Wait, that's not a button!
[39:52.75]Alright.
[39:58.99]That was fun.
[40:02.33]Just got Dark Souls invaded.
[40:08.80]You're in joke debt.
[40:10.64]No, I'm not.
[40:13.06]There's no such thing.
[40:13.80]Alright, get me out of the tutorial.
[40:31.37]And this is where I wake up from the car crash.
[40:35.63]Here we go.
[40:37.19]Alright, let's see what's on my mind now.
[40:38.33]Let's find... I was hungry before.
[40:39.65]Profiling start.
[40:46.20]Still hungry.
[40:47.02]Okay, that was like a naked lady.
[40:48.06]I'm thinking about like sex and stuff.
[40:49.48]Alright.
[40:50.82]Satan.
[40:54.10]What's going on?
[41:01.55]I'm still thinking of food.
[41:02.73]This is like lollipops, sugars, sugar donuts.
[41:07.67]There's definitely something in this town.
[41:11.27]Do you feel it, Zack?
[41:13.21]My coffee warned me about it.
[41:14.64]Just waiting for him to do another voice.
[41:15.88]Yesterday morning, the milk I poured in my coffee made a sign.
[41:19.46]It said, tomorrow you'll arrive in a place that will change your fate.
[41:24.18]He's waiting for him to be like, what do you think about that, Zack?
[41:25.84]And he's like, well, I'm not sure.
[41:27.03]Train tracks.
[41:30.37]No, I mean cars.
[41:34.32]I can't press that button.
[41:38.08]500 yards this way.
[41:39.85]Is what exactly?
[41:41.29]Why am I running?
[41:42.27]Why is this DayZ?
[41:43.55]Alright, let's run fucking 500 yards this way.
[41:48.45]I can't save the game, it's broken.
[42:03.32]Go the other way.
[42:04.58]Get the car.
[42:05.68]What car?
[42:06.22]What do you mean car?
[42:15.16]Was there a car back here?
[42:16.08]No, there's a telephone.
[42:21.57]Guys, that, that, that, I know it might look like a limousine on your screen, but that's a telephone.
[42:26.71]Yeah.
[42:28.83]I got baited.
[42:29.67]You fucking assholes.
[42:32.99]Wait, hold on.
[42:36.27]There actually might be a car up here.
[42:40.70]I don't know why that noise is happening, but that's okay.
[42:49.80]I ran out of breath.
[42:51.72]What's the other way?
[42:53.18]Now I need to know what the other way is.
[42:59.61]Just keep- oh my god, keep going for a secret?
[43:02.13]Don't fucking say that, man.
[43:03.45]Is there a secret back here?
[43:08.19]Okay.
[43:09.71]Is there- is there a secret back here?
[43:11.07]Somebody tell me if it is or not.
[43:17.10]There better not- there better be something back here, otherwise this is a fucking mistake.
[43:22.96]There is no secret.
[43:24.28]Oh god damn it.
[43:26.20]This is just a bunch of mess.
[43:27.24]This is just the in-game-
[43:32.14]Yeah, I'm getting battlefield turned around.
[43:35.46]I flew too far out with a plane and the game corrected me.
[43:38.78]Okay, now I have to go 700 yards.
[43:45.81]Secret fog.
[43:46.81]What the fuck?
[43:53.96]Metal on the left.
[43:56.60]No, I don't care.
[43:57.54]I don't care.
[43:59.30]We need to get to the... There it is.
[44:01.50]That's the right.
[44:02.12]It's a loud amount of grass.
[44:09.89]I'm not sure what that sound is, but it doesn't sound good.
[44:14.73]Alright, somebody look up real quick.
[44:20.34]Can somebody look this up for me?
[44:21.64]Real quickly.
[44:23.64]Can I, mid-game, add the save folder fix?
[44:29.46]Because otherwise this game cannot be saved.
[44:31.50]I actually did miss one.
[44:36.90]Whatever.
[44:37.76]I don't care.
[44:41.24]No stink up my ass, as they say.
[44:42.90]You know what I mean?
[44:44.60]You imagine it would work.
[44:45.64]Yes, it would work.
[44:46.40]Okay.
[44:48.92]I see a car.
[44:51.04]Oh.
[44:52.02]Almost ran out of gas.
[44:58.51]New introducing of a character.
[45:01.45]Not today.
[45:05.88]Emily Wyatt, Greenvale Deputy Sheriff.
[45:11.19]Classic saying.
[45:15.83]FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan.
[45:18.83]Please, just call me York.
[45:20.79]That's what everyone calls me.
[45:21.53]That's an interesting name.
[45:23.43]York Morgan.
[45:24.07]Agent York?
[45:25.89]Good, that's good.
[45:26.81]Maybe because I keep thinking of York Peppermint Patty.
[45:28.90]Are you the sheriff?
[45:31.14]No, I'm Deputy Sheriff Emily Wyatt.
[45:33.42]George.
[45:33.86]Special Agent York Peppermint Patty.
[45:36.16]I tingle, I burn, and then it's all chocolate.
[45:41.89]If you don't mind me asking... You know, you can also call me...
[45:46.40]Captain Diarrhea.
[45:48.26]Agent Diarrhea.
[45:49.09]Because I just described the same exact thing.
[45:51.39]That happens when you have that too.
[46:01.67]She's easy on the eyes.
[46:04.36]Definitely worth a trip to the primitive world.
[46:07.42]By the way, don't mention anything about what happened back there.
[46:10.12]Pay attention.
[46:11.04]You're a psycho.
[46:13.87]Don't want that.
[46:14.71]Huh?
[46:14.99]What else would I call you?
[46:19.55]My name's George.
[46:21.96]Call me George.
[46:22.54]Is that the joke?
[46:23.40]Is that over my head?
[46:23.92]Okay, that's a joke.
[46:24.56]They went over my head there.
[46:40.44]Could you tell me why the FBI is so interested in a small town homicide?
[46:46.00]Let's just say it's a personal interest in killers of young women.
[46:49.46]I'm always looking for new sample cases to help me with my profile.
[46:53.10]Teleporting sheriff.
[46:54.42]Both our superiors have cleared this with each other.
[46:58.21]You can remain in command.
[46:59.33]Everything goes over your head.
[47:00.25]That's not true.
[47:01.99]No.
[47:03.33]No problem.
[47:05.99]Just want to set things straight.
[47:08.03]Our small town has its share of problems.
[47:11.89]I'm the one fixing them one by one one of which is definitely not Road maintenance because whew These puppies are beautiful perfectly paved perfectly painted course of course Wish I had these in my town by the way George.
[47:28.22]I had a little accident in my car I Got a new one someone to take care of it.
[47:35.06]Oh And my clothes and luggage are still inside All right, don't worry
[47:42.29]I'll get my assistant Thomas to take care of it.
[47:46.58]Road jokes, really?
[47:47.48]That's not a joke.
[47:48.08]I'm saying that it's pristine.
[47:51.01]Nothing like a fresh paved road.
[47:54.24]Because even when you have a shitty car, you can drive on a fresh paved road and feel like you're driving a BMW from the commercial.
[48:00.06]You know, like that smug asshole that's like, oh, the ride is so clean and smooth.
[48:05.75]You can't even feel you're driving.
[48:09.07]You're just like floating.
[48:11.25]Sometimes I get that feeling with my car on a fresh paved road.
[48:16.51]And we'll handle the investigation.
[48:18.94]You just think of this as a vacation.
[48:21.30]Take it easy.
[48:22.22]Enjoy the nature here.
[48:25.02]Do I have a license?
[48:27.50]How the fuck do you think I get anywhere?
[48:30.44]No, I ride a unicycle.
[48:34.54]I drive a car.
[48:36.20]I have a car.
[48:36.76]What do you guys think I am?
[48:39.84]Like a weirdo that sits in the basement and rides around on a unicycle?
[48:42.68]Really?
[48:42.98]Is that what you think?
[48:43.64]A lawnmower.
[48:53.59]I do have a lawnmower too, but not here.
[48:55.65]I have a separate lawnmower garage I collect.
[48:58.07]Is this taking screenshots?
[49:03.93]All right, can I save it here?
[49:05.83]Let me see something.
[49:07.45]Number of days, total enemies defeated.
[49:08.96]Number of continues, clear.
[49:11.96]Can I save this game?
[49:14.46]200 bucks.
[49:17.86]Unpaid salary.
[49:19.56]All right, hold on.
[49:20.54]Give me, give me, wait, wait, wait.
[49:22.20]Create the folder mid-game.
[49:23.12]It has to be called savedata.
[49:24.58]So where does this go?
[49:26.58]Savedata goes into which directory?
[49:29.12]Just the game's directory?
[49:30.26]That's it?
[49:30.56]Because I'll do it right now.
[49:36.24]And why is the disk spinning up right now?
[49:37.70]There's no disk in here.
[49:40.30]Just in the game directory.
[49:44.47]So that would be steam, steamapps, common,
[49:51.71]deadly premonition of the director's cut and then just right here and just a new folder save data all lowercase there it is save data all lowercase hacking the system here let's see what happens when I do this what a what a
[50:20.56]Absolutely unbelievable oversight.
[50:24.58]Previously during the investigation, these puppies are making me go to another town in the boondocks again.
[50:30.75]I didn't think you'd keep me waiting in the rain for so long.
[50:33.51]Welcome to Greenland.
[50:35.57]I'm the sheriff, George Woodman.
[50:38.03]Call me George.
[50:39.09]There's definitely something in this town.
[50:40.87]Zach's view?
[50:41.61]Do you feel it, Zach?
[50:43.05]I caught your warning.
[50:48.08]All right, let's never do that again, because I'm so glad I turned it down.
[50:53.54]What the fuck are you doing?
[50:54.82]I gotta take the headphones out, doesn't matter.
[50:56.83]It's broken.
[50:58.91]I've been using that one for a long time.
[51:02.11]Sorry about sticking needles in your ears, Gus.
[51:03.75]Why didn't you get it repaired?
[51:04.77]I wish I wasn't.
[51:05.57]This TV is important to you, right?
[51:10.97]It's got some memories attached to it, sure.
[51:16.90]I used to watch movies on this thing with your grandma all the time.
[51:21.66]Grandma liked movies?
[51:23.84]Of course she did.
[51:27.08]Everyone loves movies, right?
[51:29.10]I love movies, too.
[51:31.24]I've never been to a movie theater, though.
[51:40.37]Good story.
[51:41.73]Episode 1, the first day of the investigation.
[51:45.53]So this is, uh, Angel Isaac.
[51:50.23]You got Angel Isaac.
[51:55.85]Do I have, like, powers now?
[51:57.93]To collect everybody's nameplates?
[51:59.35]Alright.
[52:04.85]Sugar Donuts, take it.
[52:08.10]This game is so bad.
[52:12.99]We can't say that yet.
[52:14.05]Remember, every game that is ever played on this stream deserves 45 minutes before we give our absolute complete opinion.
[52:31.60]Oh shit, it's been 52 minutes.
[52:34.69]Whoops.
[52:35.71]Well, not yet.
[52:36.89]We're on episode one.
[52:44.45]I don't have any guns or anything.
[52:47.78]I think I know what's going on.
[52:48.76]I think I'm... This is Zack.
[52:50.72]I'm inside of my own brain right now.
[52:52.30]Yeah.
[52:55.16]Like, I'm inside my own head.
[52:56.50]This is my brain.
[52:58.30]This is my cerebral cortex.
[53:00.58]This is my inner child.
[53:01.49]Mm-hmm.
[53:15.27]Don't breathe.
[53:17.09]Hold your breath.
[53:19.03]They can't see you if you hold your breath.
[53:22.77]Can't see you if they... Hurry.
[53:24.87]Like this.
[53:26.01]Cover your mouth.
[53:26.69]I hope this kid does not just get, like, snatched up right now.
[53:28.99]That would be terrifying.
[53:30.83]Hold your breath.
[53:31.37]R.T.
[53:37.57]Why is he leading me around?
[53:39.13]Aren't I the adult?
[53:42.29]This should be reversed.
[53:45.09]I'm just scared.
[53:45.99]I don't know what to do.
[53:49.19]Thanks for leading me around here, daddy.
[53:50.84]No!
[54:09.39]I had to do it.
[54:10.63]I had to see what was going to happen.
[54:12.47]Oh, god damn it.
[54:13.27]I had to know what was going to happen.
[54:16.03]Now I can't leave.
[54:16.73]Oh, there's the wrong door.
[54:20.49]Okay.
[54:25.26]It's so funny.
[54:26.28]He didn't do what he was supposed to do.
[54:28.04]I just wanted to see what was going to happen.
[54:31.22]I didn't... It's not like I did that particularly.
[54:34.38]There's a malice behind it.
[54:38.31]Yeah, I don't understand.
[54:44.01]Why can't I just shoot people?
[54:51.57]Oh, because I don't have any weapons in my own brain.
[54:53.27]Okay, I get it.
[54:59.41]Is the right trigger anything else?
[55:09.61]Do we have to do anything here?
[55:14.28]Or can we just... That little boy can hold his breath for a long time.
[55:21.96]I would have already lost.
[55:22.96]Why would we just keep walking?
[55:24.28]Why are we sitting here watching this?
[55:28.87]Just keep going.
[55:29.81]You don't need to hold your breath.
[55:33.99]Just go.
[55:41.29]Okay, well.
[55:43.00]Can I let go of right trigger?
[55:44.22]Is it safe?
[55:52.40]Okay.
[55:55.07]It's safe.
[55:55.49]He's breathing through his nose.
[56:05.60]He cheated.
[56:16.24]This game's not bad good, it's just bad.
[56:18.24]But don't say that yet.
[56:22.24]We gotta get at least, at least like an hour or two into this game.
[56:25.18]At least.
[56:26.65]Come on.
[56:34.11]It's not realistic.
[56:34.77]There's not a pool of sweat right there.
[56:36.41]Not realistic.
[56:38.09]And the pillow's not like stained yellow.
[56:41.43]Unrealistic game.
[56:58.47]Zach, the symbolism in my dreams continues to intensify.
[57:03.58]A forest of red trees.
[57:05.00]Did you pee your pillow?
[57:06.56]No.
[57:07.46]With red leaves, a strange doll, and twin angels.
[57:12.79]But that child is what bothers me the most.
[57:16.41]I swear I've seen him before.
[57:17.91]Come on, man.
[57:18.69]I just can't remember where.
[57:20.27]It's 2017.
[57:21.37]Your resale value is gonna drop if you do that shit.
[57:24.51]Well, it'll probably come back to me eventually.
[57:28.11]For now, we need coffee.
[57:31.37]I agree.
[57:34.57]Let's head to the cafeteria, Zach.
[57:36.05]Head to the cafeteria.
[57:37.23]I hope they have some real coffee.
[57:39.54]I really need some coffee.
[57:41.50]Then we can head to the sheriff's office.
[57:43.06]This guy's really all about coffee.
[57:44.16]There's a proper procedure for everything, right Zack?
[57:48.60]Toolbox.
[57:49.00]Do I have anything in here?
[57:52.56]Oh boy.
[57:53.46]Ben Elnor just gave one million dollars.
[58:01.05]He gave a million dollars.
[58:05.79]Holy shit.
[58:06.71]A fucking million dollars.
[58:11.78]Thank you so much, Ben.
[58:14.92]Thank you for the hundred bucks.
[58:20.96]Much appreciated.
[58:23.23]You are a fucking incredibly generous person.
[58:28.83]Did I even take the item out?
[58:34.35]I don't know.
[58:34.76]I don't know.
[58:40.29]But yeah, man.
[58:41.55]One thing I do hope... People that give this kind of money... Like, if you give this kind of fucking hard cash... I hope you have, like... I hope you got some money in oil.
[58:53.43]You know?
[58:56.69]I hope you got, like, a good 401k investment strategy.
[59:02.96]Is this a shave?
[59:03.74]Is this a shave minigame?
[59:05.04]It better be.
[59:08.04]No, it's not.
[59:13.83]This is a money laundering scheme.
[59:18.60]No, you don't do it.
[59:19.18]You just... You get money for shaving.
[59:23.74]Ethereum.
[59:26.80]But, Ben, thank you so much, man.
[59:30.34]And I don't... You know, actually, I was thinking about it.
[59:32.96]I was thinking about if I just put, like, my... Like, a Bitcoin address as, like, something down there, if anyone was, like, cared to do it.
[59:42.07]If anybody has any crypto that they want to trade or something.
[59:45.05]Because I get asked all the time to have a PayPal, but I don't know.
[59:50.59]I don't think I want to do that.
[59:53.33]You know, it's not real when it's crypto.
[59:55.23]Not yet.
[59:55.65]Not until you actually use it.
[60:03.22]How much Bitcoin do I have?
[60:06.28]I have 42,000 BTC.
[60:07.84]Something like that.
[60:10.58]Give or take.
[60:13.69]I have a feeling that I forgot something, Zach.
[60:23.34]I think I forgot to mention that I am now... I'm a billionaire.
[60:27.52]I have like 9.8 billion dollars.
[60:31.78]Well, I mean, that's why I said it's not real yet.
[60:33.42]It's in BTC, so I have like 7.8 billion dollars in BTC.
[60:40.94]What am I missing?
[60:44.30]What is this?
[60:47.05]Suit?
[60:48.25]Suit Crimson.
[60:50.55]Of course we're going to put on the Riddler.
[60:53.35]Change clothes.
[60:53.89]Put on the Riddler outfit.
[60:59.99]I have $1,000 in my wallet.
[61:04.21]Looks good.
[61:08.89]You can sleep.
[61:10.59]You can make phone calls or you can sell a safe.
[61:15.01]Buy the DLC clothes.
[61:17.26]No.
[61:24.82]Okay, well that's how you open up doors quick.
[61:27.92]Let's get out.
[61:31.79]I gotta give you guys terrible riddles for the rest of the stream.
[61:38.19]I'm not very good at riddles.
[61:39.97]Coffee, there we go.
[61:40.65]$31 for coffee.
[61:45.01]What?
[61:50.67]Are you shitting me?
[61:51.51]3150.
[61:55.14]Okay, that's it.
[62:00.52]I don't want any more.
[62:03.00]How much is a lollipop?
[62:06.39]Alright, this is some fucking inflation here, guys.
[62:08.57]This is a year like 2891.
[62:09.15]$24 for a lollipop?
[62:16.30]$35 for crackers it I would feel like in a world lollipop should be more expensive than a saltine cracker Right this hunger in this game Think of it as yen well, it's hard to think of it as yen when the US dollar symbol is there It's hard to think of that as yen when it's not the yen symbol I
[62:43.91]We got phones.
[62:45.39]Fuck it, let's just go.
[62:52.81]Just pretend it's part of a s'more.
[62:54.39]Uh, cutscene?
[62:59.14]Why does everybody walk like this?
[63:02.58]She's doing the zombie walk, but the other way.
[63:15.33]Thank you, Mrs... Polly Oxford.
[63:18.73]Just Polly is fine.
[63:20.17]Well, then.
[63:22.05]Thank you, Polly.
[63:23.05]I'm starving.
[63:28.63]All right, time for a fight.
[63:32.20]Is everything all right, Mr. Morgan?
[63:39.28]What is it, Mr. Morgan?
[63:42.61]Oh, nothing.
[63:43.46]I just said that these bacon and eggs are the very best I've ever tasted.
[63:46.82]Oh, really?
[63:48.28]You flatter me again.
[63:50.12]Well, Mr. Morgan, I'd better start cleaning up.
[63:53.24]You just take it easy.
[63:54.20]I don't know why it's such a long table.
[63:55.21]I'll bring your coffee out in a moment.
[63:56.93]Thank you, Polly.
[63:58.97]I have to warn you, though.
[64:00.47]I am very particular about my coffee.
[64:03.81]The very best you have, please.
[64:05.89]I understand.
[64:06.97]I admire it anyways.
[64:07.50]I'll be right back with it.
[64:08.78]Why did my demeanor change?
[64:11.56]I'm going to set up some bowling pins and just have her throw a bowling ball down here.
[64:25.85]Nice galaxy inside of my coffee.
[64:28.77]Look with interest.
[64:29.99]I'm going to get hypnotized by my own coffee.
[64:36.34]Did you see that, Zack?
[64:38.55]Fucking big hair.
[64:39.27]What's wrong with this guy?
[64:40.91]F. K. Alright.
[65:06.31]For some reason, this game is stupid.
[65:08.95]But I am heavily intrigued with the whole thing.
[65:13.01]I forgot something.
[65:17.80]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[65:18.66]This game is very clearly terrible.
[65:21.46]But is it?
[65:22.14]It's not.
[65:22.74]Is it?
[65:22.96]I don't think it is.
[65:25.24]It's keeping me... No, fucking goddammit.
[65:26.74]I don't want to sit down and do this.
[65:35.38]Unexpected trouble is coming your way lucky item lights always trouble hitting my way in this job But I'm always up for a little excitement to have to bring a lighter same again What I'm just I'm just pounding coffees to get why is coffee like a magic 8-ball You will have a lot of fun today lucky place the theme park.
[65:58.70]Oh this game.
[65:59.18]There's no theme park in this town though Fuck you don't tease me like that good luck is just slipping away.
[66:04.35]Oh
[66:05.81]But I think I'll have a thrilling enough time right here anyway.
[66:09.40]No, I don't want to do it again.
[66:11.30]Don't ever drink more than one or two coffees in one day.
[66:13.30]It's not fun.
[66:14.06]You just feel like shit.
[66:18.90]Let's make it outside.

[66:30.65]Polly.
[66:32.13]Oh, hi.
[66:36.61]I was waiting for her to keep talking, and this is the only time I've ever had a dialogue that wasn't read to me.
[66:41.39]If you need anything, you can find me at the front desk.
[66:43.13]I sell daily goods to guests.
[66:45.27]I don't have much, but they may help you out.
[66:48.23]So you're the sales girl too, aren't you?
[66:50.89]Yes, that's right.
[66:51.53]Coffee comes as a set with breakfast.
[66:54.23]This sound is not what I would imagine would be an old woman's voice.
[67:01.81]Great, thank you.
[67:04.33]Let's buy it.
[67:06.77]Coffee, stabilizer, cigarettes.

[67:24.20]I'm gonna buy six.
[67:25.10]$120 for a worm.
[67:27.84]That's fine.
[67:28.26]Okay, now...
[67:40.09]It's fine.
[67:42.06]I'm finished.
[67:42.70]I'm done.
[67:44.44]Thank you, Mr. Morgan.
[67:45.12]Take it easy.
[67:46.12]Same to you.
[67:46.76]$119 worth.
[67:51.40]First day.
[67:51.68]I didn't do any investigation.
[67:54.91]What?
[68:06.28]Why am I getting paid?
[68:07.76]All I did was drink coffee and hallucinate.
[68:10.14]I just got $1,221 for sitting here and being a weirdo.
[68:15.63]What kind of fucking person has that job?
[68:18.11]You sit there, you act like a fucking weirdo, you drink coffee, and you just say a bunch of nonsense.
[68:27.80]Oh.
[68:39.67]I just dropped this.
[68:40.51]That was a long drop.
[68:41.89]Of course I want to save!
[68:45.42]Should work for the FBI.
[68:57.26]Am I the sheriff?
[69:09.63]A police car?
[69:10.41]Is that mine?
[69:13.17]It is now.
[69:14.09]I'm gonna steal a police car.
[69:15.39]Our office is open from 9 to 17.
[69:17.25]Fucking military time.
[69:18.56]I hate that shit.
[69:21.42]I do.
[69:21.88]Just give me the imperial time.
[69:23.78]Whatever it is.
[69:24.30]What's it called?
[69:25.10]Wait.
[69:25.28]Do you actually get to drive cars in this game?
[69:40.37]It's gonna be a cutscene, isn't it?
[69:41.35]I have to tell you, Zack, this place... simply amazes me.
[69:45.88]The keys were left on the front hood.
[69:49.02]And nobody stole the car.
[69:50.82]Oh my god.
[69:51.54]Values.
[69:54.70]Um... This town has what the country needs.
[69:57.50]Values.
[69:58.48]Let's head over to the sheriff's department.
[70:00.14]What's the number one rule?
[70:02.10]Oh, boy.
[70:02.98]What's the number one rule for all video games, guys?
[70:09.82]If there is a drivable car, the game gets a full letter grade higher on the scale.
[70:19.07]You can turn on the windshield wipers, you can signal.
[70:23.05]How far do I have to drive?
[70:24.23]You can honk brakes.
[70:25.31]Okay, let's see.
[70:25.99]Boost is left trigger.
[70:29.20]Side brake, accelerate, change view, talk.
[70:32.72]Wait, you can just talk while you're driving?
[70:35.08]Headlights, change view, signal.
[70:37.70]Oh boy, this is going to be fun.
[70:41.76]This is a lot of random controls.
[70:43.28]I got a flare?
[70:45.38]Oh no.
[70:51.15]I can turn on the- oh well.
[70:53.15]This game just got real good.
[70:55.97]This game got good.
[70:56.79]How do I drive?
[70:57.41]Okay, this is my blinker.
[71:00.91]How do I turn the blinker off?
[71:09.10]Oh my god.
[71:11.69]This is fucking bad.
[71:13.29]What are the- what are the windshield wipers?
[71:16.31]Wait, what happened?
[71:17.03]Why don't I just get- I just got like a scary thing.
[71:20.58]No, turn this way.
[71:23.02]I have to pay attention to the gas or I'm gonna get stranded.
[71:25.90]Alright, let's go.
[71:28.48]Alright, now let's use the boost!
[71:37.05]Oh my god, there's other cars on the road too.
[71:39.93]How do I change view?
[71:42.39]How do I change view?
[71:47.55]Now you're in trouble!
[71:54.00]There's a third person mode?
[71:55.18]How do you- Oh, there it is.
[71:56.28]Okay.
[71:57.99]Pull over!
[72:00.87]this is so Zach I can actually talk about those bonus features in DVDs nowadays you know the ones from the 80s have almost no bonus not even one minute even if they do it's a trailer and the visual quality is pretty bad well that visual quality is a good reminder of those days I'm just like an old motherfucker I have my left flicker on still
[72:21.65]Do you remember the first video deck we bought?
[72:24.13]We bought it to record one of the Star Wars movies on TV.
[72:27.31]And remember when that video store opened, we spent hours there.
[72:31.16]Just trying to find a good movie to rent.
[72:32.90]What's the break with it?
[72:33.66]What did that many to choose from back then?
[72:35.16]Whoa!
[72:35.64]We were renting some really bad ones after reading those back cover taglines.
[72:40.65]Hey, remember?
[72:41.61]Attack of the Killer Tomatoes?
[72:44.35]Filmed in 1978.
[72:46.19]Produced, directed, written, and edited by John DiBello.
[72:50.63]It was really awful, but for some reason I still remember it pretty well.
[72:54.66]It had so many sequels, and the original was re-released in 95.
[72:58.06]87-minute long theatrical release bumped up to a whopping 90 minutes.
[73:03.62]But that was around the time I joined the Bureau.
[73:06.51]I never have a chance to see it.
[73:08.79]I know, Zach.
[73:10.09]Once this case is over, we can launch it together.
[73:12.67]I bet we can buy a copy on the internet pretty easily.
[73:15.67]Did the internet exist when this game came out?
[73:17.41]When did this game come out?
[73:18.09]2007?
[73:18.11]2003?
[73:19.27]How do I get out of the car?
[73:20.95]There it is.
[73:33.52]Zach, is there something here that you want to check out?
[73:35.54]We're supposed to go through Anna Graham's file at the sheriff's office, but if you want to act on a hunch, then I'm with you.
[73:45.28]Let's go in the sheriff's department.
[73:48.40]2010.
[73:48.54]That's one fine building for such a small town.
[73:51.04]This game looks really awful for 2010.
[73:52.90]The exterior would look spectacular.
[73:55.64]Don't you agree, Zach?
[73:56.46]No, it is not 2010.
[73:57.74]This looks like a PlayStation 2 game.
[74:04.80]Isn't the 360 really?
[74:13.82]Wow.
[74:14.60]Okay.
[74:16.88]They had a very low budget.
[74:19.81]They seem to do a pretty good job with that low budget.
[74:26.15]Pleasure to meet you, Agent Morgan.
[74:27.97]We've been expecting you.
[74:29.13]I'm Thomas McClane, the Sheriff's Assistant.
[74:33.15]Thomas McClane.
[74:36.09]FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan.
[74:39.55]Please, just call me York.
[74:41.01]It's what everyone else calls me.
[74:42.27]Very well, then, Agent York.
[74:44.35]I believe I owe you a thank you for retrieving my belongings from my car.
[74:48.23]Thanks.
[74:49.63]Oh, no, no.
[74:50.49]Just doing my job.
[74:52.11]I just... What's this guy's deal?
[74:54.54]I want to help do everything I can to help the investigation.
[74:59.26]I just can't believe Bono was murdered.
[75:00.36]What the fuck?
[75:00.66]I thought he was asleep.
[75:02.45]She was such a bright and lovely girl.
[75:05.71]Did you know her well?
[75:08.61]Well, no, not really.
[75:10.98]But it's a very small town.
[75:13.06]I'm sorry.
[75:14.24]It's just that this is the first really big case I've ever seen.
[75:17.86]Why is this guy being so, like, submissive?
[75:20.98]I understand.
[75:21.80]Just try to relax.
[75:22.92]I don't understand this.
[75:24.36]Can I have a look at Anna's file now?
[75:26.25]Yes, of course.
[75:27.73]The sheriff told me to let you through to the meeting room, but
[75:31.04]Am I that intimidating of a character?
[75:32.40]I'm about to pass 150,000 followers?
[75:33.28]You shitting me?
[75:33.96]150,000 followers!
[75:35.28]That's pretty cool.
[75:35.92]Hey, thanks everybody for 150,000 twitch.tv followers.
[75:37.82]That's cool.
[76:00.76]that and run wait I didn't even see it did he run weird let's do it let's go I don't have any weapons otherwise I would just start swinging all right what are we going in here a speech you want a speech uh why would I shave in the police station bathroom without a mirror
[76:25.22]And there's food on the table.
[76:27.30]This is disgusting.
[76:28.22]I just shaved like an hour ago.
[76:32.16]Why would I even have the option to do this?
[76:37.02]Thanks for the 14 shave dollars.
[76:39.18]Gray squirrel keys.
[76:43.26]What the hell is this for?
[76:46.88]It's the employee room?
[76:51.35]How many of you guys shave at work?
[76:54.41]Let's shave at work.
[76:55.55]What are you talking about?
[76:56.40]Arnold.
[76:58.52]Me.
[76:58.58]You do not shave at work.
[76:59.78]Dumbbell.
[77:00.78]Gonna be annoying to carry around.
[77:17.53]Imagine, like, going to the break room and seeing one of your coworkers in a towel.
[77:22.66]Only.
[77:22.92]And he just gets shaving cream all over his face and he's shaving in the mirror.
[77:28.84]Open it.
[77:29.12]Is there a debit card in the fridge?
[77:35.89]Turkey sandwich.
[77:36.85]That's not a turkey sandwich.
[77:39.93]It's like a microchip.
[77:40.99]Is that a picture of a turkey sandwich?
[77:42.59]It is.
[77:44.75]Okay.
[77:46.89]Okay.
[77:51.11]Thanks for the photo.
[77:52.79]I have squirrel keys now.
[77:55.81]I could run through here?
[77:57.71]No.
[77:58.21]Gotta go back.
[78:01.89]Can I get in?
[78:02.41]Can I get inside of one of these things?
[78:07.31]I hope so.
[78:07.89]Eventually.
[78:09.51]Long-tailed flying squirrel keys.
[78:14.89]Can I work out?
[78:18.43]It's hardly a mystery who uses these, is it, Zach?
[78:20.42]Alright, well...
[78:22.63]Suitcase.
[78:23.62]Can I go into a police outfit?
[78:25.00]No.
[78:26.24]Let's keep the same outfit on.
[78:28.08]It's fucking terrible, but I don't care.
[78:29.46]Here we go.
[78:32.54]Open.
[78:32.78]What the fuck is in here?
[78:36.88]Open it.
[78:41.10]George's locker looks like it's seen quite a lot of use, Spartan.
[78:44.07]Just like the owner.
[78:46.17]So why can I not open the locker?
[78:49.51]That was weird.
[78:53.60]Nothing in it.
[78:56.45]Alright, let's keep going.
[78:57.79]Out the door.
[78:58.31]You end up getting more suits later.
[79:01.19]That's cool.
[79:01.61]Let's save the game.
[79:05.31]Have you tried smashing it?
[79:07.29]No.
[79:08.89]When do I get to shoot more stuff?
[79:11.80]I want a level where I can drive around.
[79:15.62]Let's progress the story.
[79:19.52]No, it's gonna be a fucking puzzle.
[79:20.88]It's gonna be a pull-the-shelves puzzle.
[79:24.16]God damn it.
[79:26.12]Agent York, did you find the key?
[79:28.70]Oh, wait.
[79:29.86]What did he want?
[79:36.56]Which one did he want?
[79:40.97]Is this the one?
[79:41.57]You found the key.
[79:42.51]I guess that's the one.
[79:43.47]I hope so.
[79:48.29]I didn't listen to him.
[79:48.99]Hopefully that's the right one.
[79:53.55]not the right one no this is a sugar glider sorry wrong key the sugar glider is a small gliding possum it has shorter hair and a longer column like tail you can really see its muscle definition on this image can't you but we're looking for a southern flying squirrel right now Zach can you tell these things apart I have another one like that try the other one
[80:21.94]Let's try the other key.
[80:23.04]Yes, I have another key.
[80:25.20]The gray squirrel.
[80:27.35]You found the key.
[80:29.27]Is this the one you were looking for?
[80:31.49]No, that's a, uh, south... That's a south suburb.
[80:37.07]I got nothing, because I'm just watching at this point.
[80:39.93]I'm watching the video.
[80:41.45]This is a gray squirrel.
[80:43.17]Sorry, that's not the key.
[80:45.57]Nothing particularly special about the gray squirrel, I'm afraid.
[80:48.97]You can find them in the U.S., Canada, and in England, too.
[80:53.25]A grey squirrel.
[80:54.81]What was I thinking?
[80:56.27]But we're looking for a southern flying squirrel right now.
[80:58.93]Alright, whatever.
[81:05.89]I gotta obviously look around.
[81:08.89]There's other doors I haven't gone.
[81:09.93]I'll go in storage.
[81:12.15]Just find the key.
[81:14.73]Pointy-tailed flying squirrel.
[81:16.24]Get it.
[81:18.44]There's probably, like, one more.
[81:19.88]This probably is it, I would assume.
[81:22.22]Can I even go in any other doors?
[81:23.58]Yeah, I can.
[81:27.49]That's a fire exit.
[81:29.55]Let's have this be it.
[81:31.31]Three keys, three choices, three options.
[81:34.45]And it's this one.
[81:35.13]I thought he was naked.
[81:36.79]From this angle, it really looked like he didn't have any clothes on.
[81:43.43]Can't tell what the southern flying squirrel looks like.
[81:48.75]You found the key.
[81:49.69]How was I supposed to know?
[81:50.67]I think so.
[81:51.33]Is this it?
[81:52.32]Walk in, there's his pants are off and his shirt's off.
[82:00.72]Is it?
[82:02.64]You don't know your squirrels, do you?
[82:04.08]Oh, my God.
[82:04.70]This isn't the right key holder.
[82:06.45]This is a Siberian flying squirrel.
[82:09.01]It's closer to a land-based squirrel.
[82:11.09]The Siberian flying squirrel is larger than the southern flying squirrel and has a standing tail while the southern has a hanging tail.
[82:19.83]I'm just hanging out now.
[82:20.57]But we're looking for a southern flying squirrel right now.
[82:25.03]You sure do know a lot about squirrels.
[82:26.83]I thought this was supposed to be a horror game.
[82:34.25]Well, I guess we need to keep looking in the police station for the other squirrel.
[82:39.97]Let's go down.
[82:40.85]No, that's not this squirrel.
[82:46.81]It's this squirrel.
[82:53.91]You don't seem to know your squirrels, do you?
[82:59.07]Maybe I shouldn't open this.
[83:00.27]Somebody's in this jail cell.
[83:01.43]Is there a criminal in here?
[83:02.41]No, just a random police.
[83:05.65]Yeah, there are criminals in here, aren't there?
[83:11.97]Who has the last squirrel key?
[83:13.46]Come on.
[83:14.22]I don't sleep in the bed?
[83:15.50]No.
[83:22.10]No, I don't have to go to sleep.
[83:23.04]Not yet.
[83:25.44]Just looking for a key.
[83:29.60]What about this guy?
[83:30.70]Hopefully we'll be bringing in the culprit soon.
[83:33.14]No, that'll mean the end of our little vacation here.
[83:37.88]Can't talk to that guy through the cell.
[83:41.06]And it's gonna be in the toilet.
[83:42.58]Alright, fine.
[83:49.21]Curvy-tailed flying squirrel keys.
[83:53.24]This one's gold, so it has to be the right one.
[84:02.65]Shave again?
[84:04.27]Go shave in the bathroom sink.
[84:06.77]There is no way to shave.
[84:07.85]I can't shave in the toilet.
[84:14.15]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[84:19.05]What?
[84:19.21]I can't let out the villain?
[84:20.65]I can't let the Joker out?
[84:24.39]That's too bad.
[84:25.99]Alright, we're good.
[84:29.87]The golden one's definitely the right one.
[84:34.61]Didn't notice the door in the cell?
[84:35.87]Yeah, I did notice the door in the cell.
[84:37.23]Like, what am I supposed to do about it?
[84:43.65]I need the southern flying squirrel.
[84:46.31]It doesn't say that on the key.
[84:49.45]I'm gonna give it the gold.
[84:50.45]It's going to be the gold key.
[84:53.20]This game was made in 2004.
[84:55.08]It's the one that's the different colored key.
[84:58.59]Check it out.
[84:59.97]You found the key.
[85:02.47]That's the right one?
[85:03.47]That's the right one.
[85:10.34]See?
[85:11.18]He's like, yeah!
[85:12.48]Yes.
[85:13.40]A southern flying squirrel.
[85:15.32]Thank you so much.
[85:17.00]I'll bring the files right in, so please go to the meeting room.
[85:22.07]Okay, I'll be waiting for you.
[85:23.05]What are you guys talking about?
[85:24.99]Everyone's telling me I was wrong.
[85:27.17]What are you guys on about?
[85:29.46]Definitely not that one.
[85:36.52]Oh, fuck.
[85:37.06]My game's crashing.
[85:39.04]No, I haven't saved.
[85:39.74]I don't want to do this stupid squirrel key thing again.
[85:41.98]Come on.
[85:44.54]Come on.
[85:47.26]No, hold on.
[85:47.87]I gotta...
[85:52.14]You stupid thing.
[85:53.78]Oh my lord.
[85:59.04]Wait, no, we're okay.
[85:59.76]We're okay.
[86:01.35]We're back.
[86:01.65]The victim's name was Anna Graham.
[86:04.27]Age 18.
[86:05.49]We're good.
[86:06.19]Graduated from high school this year.
[86:08.86]Her dream was to move out to the city and become a model.
[86:12.32]But for the time being, she was working in the A&G diner here in town.
[86:16.75]She lived with her mother, Sally.
[86:18.63]Anna's father died in an accident in the lumber mill when she was a child.
[86:25.83]Her mother is unemployed and lives on the insurance money from her husband's accident.
[86:31.13]Looks like a Cinnabon.
[86:31.93]I love Cinnabons.
[86:32.87]That's a core of a Cinnabon.
[86:34.31]Best part of a Cinnabon core.
[86:35.29]After all, it's a small town with a low cost of living.
[86:38.48]Financially, they seem to get by fine, and they led normal lives.
[86:42.34]A normal life is exactly what a curious teenager doesn't want.
[86:47.92]It's all starting to make sense, Zach.
[86:49.28]Do want.
[86:50.56]Oh, a deadly premonition.
[86:51.78]Do want.
[86:54.98]Eat that, Cinnabon Core.
[86:57.88]Yeah.
[87:00.36]City folk, huh?
[87:02.45]No.
[87:03.25]No, I take that back.
[87:04.85]All of them can't be as bad as him.
[87:06.11]That's not a donut.
[87:06.87]Some should have better manners.
[87:08.31]Huh.
[87:09.31]Have you guys ever seen a donut before?
[87:10.65]It's a good biscuit.
[87:11.41]It's a biscuit, see?
[87:12.61]I've never tasted a biscuit this delicious.
[87:16.59]Where in town can I get these?
[87:18.25]Well, actually, I, well, I baked them myself.
[87:26.07]I hate this game.
[87:26.91]It's amazing.
[87:29.25]What are you doing in law enforcement?
[87:30.49]I'm very particular about biscuits, I'll have you know.
[87:33.86]The balance of milk and butter you've achieved here.
[87:37.42]Oh, man.
[87:37.58]I think I hate this game so much that I like it.
[87:39.58]Creepy painting.
[87:39.98]No, that's not- I'm eating the core of an apple that's been in the trash for four days.
[88:12.03]When an apple gets all brown and gross.
[88:21.73]17.
[88:21.85]I lost money.
[88:24.10]I didn't make as much money this time.
[88:31.06]When do I get to the good stuff?
[88:32.10]The country ham.
[88:35.11]That took an hour?
[88:36.03]No, that's total in-game time.
[88:39.18]That's my total in-game time.
[88:41.04]That's not just for that part.
[88:42.62]It might have felt like an hour, but I can assure you it was not an hour.
[88:52.94]The Greenvale General Hospital is down the road by the lake.
[88:55.82]It's too far to walk.
[88:57.49]Come on, get in the car.
[88:58.57]If I'm riding in a car, George, I prefer to be the driver.
[89:01.69]Can you provide a car for me?
[89:02.91]What are you talking about?
[89:04.43]You don't even know how to get there.
[89:06.73]Did I see the pickles?
[89:07.43]Yes.
[89:07.51]Can I ghost ride this guy?
[89:08.29]Okay.
[89:36.16]George, we better get moving.
[89:37.82]The hospital closes at 2100.
[89:38.88]Nobody... Yo!
[89:39.42]I don't know what time that is!
[89:43.56]What time is that?
[89:44.30]21,000.
[89:44.32]I don't know what that means.
[89:45.42]Is that... 24 is midnight.
[89:45.88]No, 24 is 1.
[89:46.04]No, it's not.
[89:46.32]24 is midnight.
[89:47.44]So that's 23 is 11.
[89:47.92]22 is 10.
[89:48.16]21 is 9.
[89:48.30]Why do I have a fucking cape on now?
[89:49.96]I thought I had like a superhero cape.
[89:51.39]9 p.m.
[90:07.21]I want to drive the van.
[90:14.13]Agent Morgan, get us there quickly, but drive within the speed limit.
[90:17.37]Just because you have a badge doesn't mean you can drive like a maniac.
[90:20.27]Yes, it does.
[90:20.75]George, what are you, his mother?
[90:23.22]We just need to get the autopsy results.
[90:25.72]Agent York isn't accustomed to the tone yet.
[90:27.72]I'm just kidding.
[90:28.44]It's easy.
[90:28.90]Am I actually going to get in trouble if I don't drive the speed limit here?
[90:35.84]Well then, Agent York, let's get going.
[90:38.10]Sure.
[90:38.70]Sounds good.
[90:39.68]Okay, sure.
[90:40.68]Make sure you drive within the speed limit.
[90:44.82]I'm sorry.
[90:45.34]Sometimes I have to just press the buttons a little.
[90:47.20]When I was a kid.
[90:50.10]I used to go to the block party.
[90:53.21]And there'd be one cruiser there.
[90:54.73]There'd be one fire truck.
[90:57.57]And I actually got to press the button when I was eight.
[90:59.95]And now I get to do it whenever I want!
[91:03.03]It's so awesome.
[91:06.26]Keep going.
[91:09.90]Agent Morgan, I can't help noticing you prefer to work alone.
[91:13.78]Most of the time, yes.
[91:14.98]Don't you get lonely flying all over the country alone?
[91:17.87]I must say I've never felt lonely.
[91:20.23]Are you married?
[91:21.01]Unfortunately, relationships and I are fleeting strangers.
[91:25.40]I don't get on very well with women.
[91:27.16]You might be surprised to hear.
[91:28.42]That's because you're young.
[91:29.64]You notice things like that at my age.
[91:32.22]You have to treat women carefully.
[91:33.78]Why can't I drive over this?
[91:35.30]I don't understand.
[91:36.44]If you don't, they can cut scars on your face.
[91:39.00]Just like yours, right?
[91:41.02]What is preventing me from driving?
[91:43.45]I see you're a seasoned professional.
[91:44.85]There's random invisible kaizo blocks.
[91:46.43]Let's not talk about my scar.
[91:48.21]It was caused by a problematic woman.
[91:51.26]Well, she got you good.
[91:53.34]Terribly good.
[91:54.20]It'll fade away, and nobody will notice it in a week.
[91:56.90]A week?
[91:58.33]It's not that bad.
[91:58.85]How do I get out of here?
[92:03.47]So, Emily, tell me.
[92:06.66]Is there really a need for a full-time sheriff in a small town like this?
[92:10.46]I'm sure it is small to your city eyes, but any gathering of people leads to all kinds of problems.
[92:16.19]Fights, runways, stray pets.
[92:18.83]You're too fixated on violent crimes.
[92:21.21]Our job is to guide the people along the correct path, first and foremost.
[92:25.19]That's what I consider to be my duty as the sheriff of Greenville.
[92:28.00]Like there he is, the monarch, in all his glory.
[92:32.51]I'm not even on the mini-map anymore.
[92:34.07]This is a shortcut?
[92:34.81]Shortcut?
[92:35.17]Got it.
[92:35.65]Alright, is that thing in the lower left telling me that that's what time might be?
[92:40.86]Where's the actual time?
[93:02.26]Hold on, did I just drive... Did I just go around in a circle?
[93:07.43]I think I did.
[93:08.11]Ah, shit.
[93:15.51]The time is 50%.
[93:16.63]It's alright, guys.
[93:19.45]It's only 4900 hours.
[93:28.10]I'm just driving so fast.
[93:29.56]I gotta get there before it's like 3pm.
[93:37.95]Actual goldfish memory?
[93:39.61]No, that's not true.
[93:40.49]I'm just trying to get my bearings in the video game.
[93:46.67]Use the town map.
[93:48.51]No, I ain't using fucking GPSs.
[93:50.29]Not anymore.
[93:53.23]You guys, you millennials can't just rely on a computer to tell you where to go.
[93:58.54]I'm going fishing.
[94:01.34]Fuck these people.
[94:10.70]If you're wandering off, then we'll go on ahead.
[94:13.00]Wait, what?
[94:13.56]We don't have time to mess around.
[94:15.56]Okay, I'll meet up with you later.
[94:17.12]Agent York, the hospital closes at 2100.
[94:20.39]Please make it inside before then.
[94:23.19]I need the car.
[94:24.19]Don't go without me.
[94:26.07]Oh, okay.
[94:26.43]2100.
[94:26.45]What time is it?
[94:28.17]1037?
[94:28.19]This is what we came here for.
[94:39.30]Standard rod.
[94:39.92]Yes, that's the one.
[94:40.58]Put some normal bait on it.
[94:44.65]Wait for the right timing to get a big hit.
[94:46.71]But if your line breaks, you will lose one bait, so be careful.
[94:51.75]Throw it in.
[94:52.15]I don't know what button to press to pull it up.
[94:57.87]Could use a better angle than this, though.
[94:59.23]I don't know what I'm supposed to be pressing here.
[95:06.29]The sticks?
[95:09.93]You didn't even tell me what to fucking press!
[95:14.94]I'm a millennial?
[95:16.58]Exactly!
[95:17.04]I need your understanding.
[95:20.14]Does it just tap A?
[95:31.91]Or does it move the sticks?
[95:41.14]I don't know what to do literally literally literally just literally literally $240 down the drain literally I don't know Is it a dog?
[96:00.31]Are the dogs friendly in this game?
[96:02.31]Or are they hostile?
[96:04.09]Is there a pet dog command?
[96:08.40]No, you can't interact with them, unfortunately.
[96:11.26]There is some random guy's house, though.
[96:14.84]No, these are bathrooms.
[96:17.40]Alright, where's the car?
[96:18.04]Let's go.
[96:18.68]What time is it?
[96:19.12]1043?
[96:19.82]Plenty of time.
[96:24.55]Pretty big oversight, it is.
[96:25.57]I was on the right track, right?
[96:32.89]780 yards.
[96:40.31]I got plenty of time.
[96:46.23]Does this use extra gas if you punch it?
[96:52.62]I don't like that big spin out.
[96:56.74]Alright.
[96:57.52]How did I get that wedged?
[97:02.61]I don't know.
[97:04.49]Speaking of 80s movies, one jewel in the rough springs to mind.
[97:08.20]I don't want to listen to this.
[97:09.22]Just get out of the car.
[97:10.38]Go in the GTA 5 online lobby.
[97:13.86]Zach, we're here.
[97:15.33]Let's continue our chat later.
[97:16.99]Rainvale Hospital.
[97:21.73]Rainvale Hospital.
[97:32.41]Agent Morgan, have you no respect for rules and protocol?
[97:36.67]We were waiting for you, and now you try to go in by yourself.
[97:39.99]Oh, George, I didn't see you in the parking lot, so I thought I'd wait inside.
[97:46.89]Just watch it from now on.
[97:52.39]I don't like inconsiderate people who think that they're above the rules, and I'm sure I've made this point clear by now.
[97:58.92]Calm down, George.
[98:00.54]He probably just got lost on his way here and rushed in.
[98:03.66]Right, Agent York?
[98:05.02]Sure.
[98:05.76]That's exactly what happened.
[98:06.78]Thank you for covering for me.
[98:12.37]Potatoes will satisfy a small... I have to eat.
[98:14.29]I think I have some food in my inventory.
[98:19.81]Hello, Sheriff.
[98:22.29]Freckly Fiona, the receptionist.
[98:27.49]Hi there, Fiona.
[98:28.91]We're here to see Usha.
[98:30.61]Do you know where he is?
[98:31.53]I think Dr. Johnson is in the computer room.
[98:35.29]The computer room?
[98:37.17]In a hospital?
[98:39.14]Nice to meet you, Mr. FBI agent.
[98:41.46]The computer room is where our employees share a computer.
[98:44.24]Very nice to meet you, too.
[98:46.08]I'm FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan.
[98:48.48]But how did you know I was FBI?
[98:51.55]Easy.
[98:52.45]None of the police in this town wear cologne.
[98:57.73]Is she going to turn into a titan now?
[99:01.71]Somebody's going to get that.
[99:02.53]Somebody will get that and you will think that was really funny.
[99:06.43]I don't care if more than half of you don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.
[99:10.29]Somebody's going to think that was funny.
[99:15.02]You haven't heard of this yet?
[99:17.02]It's a recent bestseller mystery.
[99:19.02]It's set in the U.S., a small traditional North American town close to the Canadian border.
[99:24.64]A peaceful, traditional place.
[99:26.55]However, that peaceful town is shattered by a terrible crime.
[99:30.21]The murder of a local girl.
[99:31.83]I don't even watch anime.
[99:32.97]I've seen like four.
[99:33.53]Super Mario Super Show.
[99:34.43]Adventure Time.
[99:34.81]Teen Titans.
[99:43.54]He's referenced so many animes, he's a fucking liar.
[100:10.40]No, I don't even know what that is, man.
[100:12.28]I don't even know.
[100:12.90]What is that?
[100:13.40]Is it made in Japan or something?
[100:16.12]I don't even know.
[100:16.70]I don't think I've heard of one before.
[100:18.58]You know, I don't think I've heard of one.
[100:20.56]I mean, like, full metal?
[100:24.45]Full, like, the guy with the arm and, like, the guy with the big suit of armor?
[100:27.87]I don't think I've heard of that.
[100:35.95]I've seen every fucking episode of Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super and Dragon Ball Z Kai, all of them.
[100:45.49]Four times.
[100:57.98]Sunny in the morning, but cloud at noon that should turn into rain by the evening.
[101:03.87]You're like an old man.
[101:04.77]I would love to just... No.
[101:06.69]Don't say that.
[101:08.23]He's like a random old man.
[101:10.81]Alright.
[101:11.86]What do we do here?
[101:12.50]What's your favorite anime here?
[101:17.96]What is my favorite anime?
[101:19.40]What is my favorite anime?
[101:20.90]I wonder.
[101:23.62]Hmm.
[101:25.68]I don't know what it is.
[101:27.51]Favorite anime.
[101:32.07]Hmm.
[101:35.62]I don't know.
[101:36.68]I'm the wrong person to ask this question to.
[101:44.47]What is this, Stardew Valley?
[101:48.37]We couldn't find him.
[101:49.27]Fiona needs to check her information.
[101:53.90]No, I don't think so.
[101:55.94]Does the doctor like playing games by any chance?
[101:58.62]What do you mean?
[102:00.66]There's a message on the computer and a card key already set in place.
[102:05.24]The king passes the rook and meets the bishop.
[102:10.36]The knight takes a pawn along for the queen.
[102:14.38]What does that all mean?
[102:16.27]It's a simple puzzle.
[102:18.64]Zach, let's take him up on his challenge.
[102:20.88]You can do this, right?
[102:21.72]Can I get to a point where I, like, drive somebody, like, what did he say?
[102:26.06]I fucking missed it.
[102:27.23]This game's been a bunch of fucking dialogue, and I haven't been paying any attention.
[102:30.93]What is it?
[102:31.45]It's right there.
[102:32.01]King passes rook and meets bishop.
[102:34.19]I don't know what the king is.
[102:35.11]Is the king the godly one?
[102:36.41]The king's the godly one.
[102:37.39]King passes rook and meets bishop.
[102:38.71]No, no, no.
[102:39.37]King passes... No, no, no.
[102:41.31]Back it up, back it up.
[102:41.95]King passes rook and meets bishop.
[102:43.45]The bishop is also... Bishop is the, um...
[102:47.52]Well, that's the seahorse.
[102:48.74]That's not the correct one.
[102:51.46]Knight takes a pawn to the queen.
[102:52.82]Alright, so... Knight takes pawn to queen.
[102:59.74]The rook is this one.
[103:01.18]No, that's the bishop.
[103:02.16]This is a pawn.
[103:03.40]This is the queen.
[103:03.98]This is the bishop.
[103:06.40]So, king passes rook.
[103:07.93]Rook is this one.
[103:09.63]So, king passes the rook and meets up with the bishop.
[103:13.73]And then the knight and pawn take the queen to...
[103:23.57]How did I get it wrong?
[103:24.51]Zach, something is still missing.
[103:26.77]We need more clues.
[103:29.39]What?
[103:30.38]Do it again.
[103:32.22]Alright, king passes rook and meets the bishop.
[103:33.88]Knight takes pawn to the queen.
[103:35.20]Okay, knight takes pawn to the queen.
[103:38.04]So I got the king.
[103:39.44]He passes the rook and meets up with the bishop.
[103:47.62]How did I fuck that up?
[103:48.28]What are you talking about?
[103:51.50]They're labeled.
[103:54.90]King passes rook and meets the bishop.
[103:59.04]Knight takes a pawn to the queen.
[104:03.32]That's the knight.
[104:03.88]That's the queen.
[104:04.52]So the knight is taking the pawn to the queen.
[104:11.12]I did it the other way around and it wasn't right.
[104:15.56]King then rook.
[104:16.38]That doesn't mean he's passing him.
[104:27.84]Don't even fucking tell me.
[104:30.15]Am I overthinking this puzzle?
[104:34.91]Are you fucking serious?
[104:36.31]I mean, King passes Rook and meets Bishop.
[104:38.93]KING.
[104:39.90]PASSES ROOK.
[104:41.84]And meets- That means he's in front of the fucking Rook.
[104:45.06]Not behind him.
[104:47.84]Excuse me!
[104:48.76]Another code?
[104:50.99]But there's nowhere to insert a password.
[104:53.67]More games.
[104:55.19]I'm going to get Fiona to call Usha up here right now.
[104:57.77]That means he's in the place ahead of Rook.
[105:00.39]The message appeared with the card key.
[105:02.61]It's telling us where to use it.
[105:03.81]This is not the time to be joking around, Agent Morgan.
[105:08.93]Dr. Usha is below with the deceased.
[105:11.04]With Ana.
[105:13.20]Below being underground, I take it.
[105:15.78]Simple.
[105:16.62]More games.
[105:17.40]More games.
[105:18.22]Games.
[105:18.64]More games.
[105:20.54]Then it's time to meet the mischievous architect of this little game.
[105:25.10]Why do I like this shit game so much?
[105:26.66]I don't know, why am I still here?
[105:29.97]Why am I still playing this game?
[105:32.07]I have not been able to figure that part out.
[105:42.13]It's time to duel.
[105:42.95]And I'll show him with this.
[105:48.25]Dave and Buster's player card.
[105:51.76]Half off Wednesdays.
[105:52.90]Oh, come on.
[105:59.65]I need to go down.
[106:00.29]I need to go down.
[106:04.69]Ay-yi-yi.
[106:05.95]This is not the right way.
[106:09.15]Don't think of this game as a typical horror game.
[106:12.99]Well, that's pretty clear that this is not a typical horror game.
[106:22.07]No, open it.
[106:23.93]Open it.
[106:26.33]Read the directions.
[106:29.43]Read the direc- oh.
[106:33.04]Main.
[106:42.40]Am I hungry?
[106:43.22]I am.
[106:44.42]I'm hungry.
[106:45.14]No, I'm not.
[106:47.19]I ate a lot.
[106:55.74]I'm just gonna play like Guitar Hero on stream next.
[107:02.50]Play it on expert and show you guys what I can do.
[107:07.49]I forgot the pickles.
[107:09.15]Maybe I forgot the pickles.
[107:15.63]No, I don't want to go to bed.
[107:16.99]This is like a random hospital.
[107:21.38]Sleep for 12 hours in the hospital bed.
[107:23.90]Agent York, I'm sorry.
[107:25.12]The hospital's closing now.
[107:26.68]Could you come back tomorrow?
[107:28.36]But we still haven't heard the autopsy results.
[107:30.98]I'm sorry.
[107:31.82]That's the rule.
[107:33.20]Dr. Johnson always makes a fuss about these things.
[107:36.02]Agent Morgan, we can't force our way in.
[107:38.84]You must respect the ways of our town.
[107:41.10]Rules.
[107:42.44]Rules.
[107:44.32]Zach, from the looks of it, there's nothing we can do.
[107:46.32]I didn't think that was going to happen.
[107:47.44]We'll have to just come back tomorrow.
[107:49.66]That's it for today, then.
[107:51.57]Let's meet up here again tomorrow.
[107:54.07]Okay.
[107:55.15]See you then.
[107:56.19]Let's do a little bit of detective work.
[107:57.97]Yeah.
[108:00.01]I don't think that has any relation to the case.
[108:02.35]These two people aren't suspects.
[108:04.48]Time to go to bed for 12 hours.
[108:06.84]Oh, man.
[108:14.34]Alright, can I go?
[108:15.36]Is it time?
[108:15.74]Are they open yet?
[108:19.28]Can I sleep on the ground?
[108:21.48]No one's here.
[108:23.27]Of course, they did mention that the hospital closes at 2100.
[108:25.63]Well, so much for that.
[108:27.85]I'll just have to come back tomorrow.
[108:30.95]Can I sleep on the ground?
[108:31.77]That has to be like a bed somewhere.
[108:34.53]I can just sleep in the grass.
[108:37.89]What is back here?
[108:38.57]A bed.
[108:42.35]No.
[108:42.57]It's a metal back here.
[108:49.57]Smoke my cigarette.
[108:52.00]Where's my time travel cigar I Can't go that high George George wait for me George George Can I get a ride home with you?
[109:22.44]George, can I get in your car?
[109:28.46]Wait, this is my hamburger car.
[109:31.44]Get in quick.
[109:36.24]Come on, I gotta track him down.
[109:38.33]I can't let him get away.
[109:41.55]Fuck, he got away.
[109:42.11]Did he get away?
[109:44.85]Shit, he got away.
[109:45.67]What are you doing?
[109:51.36]What the fuck was that?
[109:53.23]Zach, is there something here that you want to check out?
[109:55.49]They told us to be there before 2100.
[109:58.09]But don't worry about that.
[109:59.67]Let's do whatever you want to do.
[110:03.19]It's technically before 2100, right?
[110:07.68]Sleep in the car.
[110:09.90]Guys, it is technically right now before 2100 hours.
[110:11.86]Because we passed it.
[110:24.65]No one's here.
[110:26.41]Of course, they did mention that the hospital closes at 2100.
[110:28.79]Well, so much for that.
[110:31.83]I'll just have to come back tomorrow.
[110:33.27]How many times is this guy going to go up and try the door?
[110:36.61]Oh, man.
[110:37.17]All right, let's go.
[110:42.11]You're not wrong, but also, fuck you.
[110:44.31]Hey, come on.
[110:47.23]That's not how it works.
[110:50.48]Between 9 a.m.
[110:51.98]And 9 p.m.
[110:53.04]Don't back into this again, please get me out of here Where am I supposed to go?
[110:58.27]What else can I do I have to do I'm seriously I have to go to sleep What is this circle for?
[111:13.06]Game start I guess we're doing a race
[111:20.28]This is just a checkpoint race.
[111:23.82]Don't accidentally press A, or you'll quit the game.
[111:32.13]By the way, what kind of psychopath am I?
[111:35.61]I checked the door twice after I slept and got kicked out, and now I'm just doing like... Now I'm just doing peel-outs in their parking lot.
[111:45.38]And speeding around in their parking lot.
[111:50.82]Like, this guy is a grade-A psychopath.
[112:00.75]Oh, goddammit!
[112:01.91]What are you doing?
[112:08.43]Why would they let this be even a possibility?
[112:10.61]No one's here.
[112:12.93]Of course they did mention that the hospital closes at 2100.
[112:15.27]Well, so much for that.
[112:17.43]I'll just have to come back tomorrow.
[112:20.84]Can I finish the race?
[112:21.78]Oh my fucking god.
[112:30.53]It blocks the race.
[112:35.90]Yeah, and why is the hospital closing?
[112:37.26]That's right.
[112:38.83]I lost the race.
[112:40.23]Oh boy, I thought it was going to happen again.
[112:42.41]Don't touch it.
[112:44.05]I'm just going to go.
[112:45.79]I would love to do the race, but it's not going to happen.
[112:49.92]I'm just going to go do a side mission.
[112:51.68]I'll go to sleep.
[112:58.84]Can I go through this?
[113:00.56]Nope, I can't.
[113:03.20]Reload the save.
[113:05.18]No, no rewinds, man.
[113:06.55]Not allowed.
[113:07.21]Oh, fuck.
[113:08.77]He's gonna start talking to himself.
[113:12.15]One jewel in the rough springs to mind.
[113:14.93]Deadly spawn.
[113:15.79]Wait a minute.
[113:16.25]These are the guys I was just with?
[113:18.21]Back in 83.
[113:19.69]Directed by Douglas McCown.
[113:21.69]Right.
[113:22.25]It was filmed pretty cheap.
[113:23.07]It took him this long to get out of here?
[113:25.16]The monster design with the mouth crammed full of teeth.
[113:28.06]I loved it.
[113:29.16]So many delicious B-movie cliches.
[113:32.12]Did you know that they made a sequel?
[113:33.88]But I never got to see the sequel.
[113:35.30]Oh, man.
[113:36.18]The rental store didn't have it for some reason.
[113:38.56]They said the staff for the sequel was totally different from the original.
[113:41.79]Tail George.
[113:42.35]All right, I'm going to follow George.
[113:43.15]I wonder how the sequel turned out.
[113:45.35]You're just not a good driver.
[113:47.85]He just keeps hard braking.
[113:49.35]Is he doing this on purpose to fuck with me?
[113:50.85]Stop doing that, dude.
[113:52.36]Stop riding your brake.
[113:53.52]Like a 75-year-old lady.
[113:54.66]He wants to go around so badly, but he's not gonna.
[113:56.68]He's just hammering his brakes on me.
[114:17.33]Don't do that, guys.
[114:20.57]If you're ever driving a car, don't hit your brakes like that.
[114:22.39]Because guess what?
[114:22.81]I have to do it too.
[114:23.41]The person behind me has to do it.
[114:24.33]The person behind them has to do it.
[114:26.49]And somebody down that chain is going to hit the person in front of them.
[114:29.83]All because you wanted to change your fucking radio station.
[114:35.22]Don't text and drive.
[114:36.86]Pay attention to your fucking 10 and 2 on the wheel.
[114:40.44]No bullshit.
[114:42.30]I'm leaving.
[114:43.78]This is dumb.
[114:46.56]How many people have... Is this a funeral?
[114:48.99]Why are we all going in the same direction?
[114:50.55]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[114:51.59]I don't even know where I'm going.
[115:04.29]They teach 9 and 3 now, do they really?
[115:07.19]Oh, I can sleep in there.
[115:15.19]I can sleep in this random outhouse.
[115:16.47]2100 on the wheel.
[115:21.14]Oh my god.
[115:21.36]Let's go sleep in the outhouse.
[115:22.10]I gotta... It's only been 13 minutes.
[115:22.90]Why is this counting in real time?
[115:42.86]Isn't this supposed to be like Minecraft?
[115:44.12]When does, like, the scene change?
[115:49.86]Alright, here we go.
[115:51.90]Sleep in here.
[116:03.54]Alright.
[116:04.78]Here we go.
[116:07.30]Sleep.
[116:10.36]I am gonna sleep on the ground, aren't I?
[116:13.11]Okay, what time is it right now?
[116:14.23]21.
[116:14.25]So we need to go 21 to... Here.
[116:17.73]No.
[116:17.87]Six hours.
[116:18.65]That's not ridiculous.
[116:27.74]What is going on right now?
[116:29.82]I've already got something to eat soon.
[116:34.09]Why is the world closing in on me?
[116:44.14]Alright, I need to eat a donut.
[116:45.60]Need a sugar donut.
[116:46.35]And can I eat the worm too?
[116:49.13]I'm gonna put a hunger.
[116:54.63]Oh my god, this really, this sucks.
[116:58.03]Cracker.
[117:00.49]What did I just do?
[117:02.53]No, I wanted to eat a fucking cracker!
[117:08.89]Huh?
[117:15.44]What just happened?
[117:16.14]Did I just get a... Did I just... This got a ghost car to come to me.
[117:23.99]I thought I clicked on Cracker.
[117:27.95]Did I not click on the Cracker?
[117:32.97]Apparently not.
[117:33.91]I thought I was on Cracker.
[117:36.41]Yeah, it was a fucking Uber... It was a Lyft... It was a taxi flare.
[117:48.41]I'm not eating the pickles.
[117:50.37]Alright, it's 3.17.
[117:52.69]Okay, so after like 3 o'clock in the morning is when the monsters come out.
[117:56.46]I get it.
[117:56.80]This is gonna be fun.
[118:02.50]Let's do some driving.
[118:09.98]Let's see if this game has some fun.
[118:13.70]Physics.
[118:14.05]Let's try to drive into this person.
[118:23.29]There is no physics.
[118:26.91]Can they even hurt me?
[118:27.71]I don't think they can.
[118:31.65]I'm almost 99% positive this guy will not do anything to me.
[118:36.66]I think he's just gonna back into the car and it's gonna kill him.
[118:48.65]Well, that wasn't too bad.
[118:51.72]Now let's get to the hospital.
[118:52.60]Now wait a minute.
[118:59.10]What enemy are these guys from?
[119:00.34]Like Mario?
[119:01.98]The enemies that... They're in the ground and they come up and they die, but you can kill them when they're in the ground.
[119:07.74]The moles that throw the wrenches.
[119:09.23]That's what it reminds me of.
[119:13.99]It's 3 a.m.?
[119:15.53]Well... You're right.
[119:18.77]I gotta go back.
[119:24.41]What if I had an emergency?
[119:25.38]What if my fucking arm got cut off?
[119:27.42]What the fuck is that thing?
[119:29.36]What is that thing?
[119:30.66]What is that giant fucking dog?
[119:33.44]Huh?
[119:35.84]Huh?
[119:37.26]Oh my Jesus Christ!
[119:39.51]Does this thing chase you?
[119:45.75]Where's the thing?
[119:46.13]Wait, I gotta go back to bed.
[119:46.89]Back to sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.
[119:48.35]Back to sleep.
[119:50.47]Back to sleep.
[119:53.32]Oh boy, that is fucking terrifying.
[119:59.04]I'm going back to bed right now.
[120:10.09]Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.
[120:12.47]Good night.
[120:13.55]I ain't dealing with this right now.
[120:14.61]Alright, let's see if we can let three hours.
[120:22.70]Six hours to get us to the morning.
[120:29.75]That was pretty terrifying.
[120:33.91]Okay.
[120:35.15]Back to the hospital.
[120:41.14]Why six?
[120:41.80]Because now it's nine.
[120:48.29]It's going to take some getting used to.
[120:49.39]Not being the triggers.
[120:51.73]Usually it's right trigger, left trigger.
[120:53.15]It's right bumper, left bumper.
[120:55.63]As odd as that sounds.
[120:58.88]What's this?
[121:01.68]What is that?
[121:02.02]I don't want it.
[121:14.21]game legit is scary I did not expect a gigantic dog that runs 100 miles per hour no I didn't tremors I think fred ward was in it you say fred ward and I say remo williams the adventure begins that one was back in 85 I think directed by fine I'll eat it I'll eat the pickles everyone's freaking out eat the pickles eat the pickles
[121:41.25]I already did.
[121:41.81]Because I already ate the pickles.
[121:48.92]Yep.
[121:52.26]I already ate them.
[121:58.64]I don't understand.
[121:59.76]What happened that was... Eat the worm.
[122:02.45]No, I don't need to eat the worm.
[122:05.99]A little lollipop for breakfast.
[122:16.12]Get that boost.
[122:18.30]Slow it down.
[122:22.82]It's right here.
[122:23.42]Not bad.
[122:26.80]Nailed it.
[122:27.44]Yeah, these worms are $119.
[122:28.51]What are they, fucking crypto worms?
[122:42.58]Agent Morgan, have you no respect for rules and protocol?
[122:46.12]I thought he took out a gun.
[122:46.92]We were waiting for you, and now you try to go in by yourself.
[122:52.09]Mm-hmm.
[122:53.55]That's me.
[123:00.57]So, uh... George, let's hope we can finally meet Dr. Johnson today.
[123:04.39]We need to get the results of Anna's autopsy as soon as possible.
[123:07.55]Then let's stop talking and hurry.
[123:10.36]I don't think I'm going to do it tomorrow, but I'm going to do a Christmas decoration stream.
[123:16.20]So one of the streams probably next week, or when we get a little bit closer to Christmas, I'm going to do a full-on IRL decorate this room and have it be just like an extreme Christmas room.
[123:31.21]Hope you guys are ready for that.
[123:32.97]Hopefully you like that.
[123:33.91]It's going to be fun.
[123:40.86]Alright, now what was I doing before?
[123:42.70]Before all this nonsense started?
[123:45.80]The first thing I hear when I enter the stream is a cryptocurrency joke.
[123:49.32]I'm so sorry.
[123:55.41]Christmas, no, it's not, we're, there's going to be no comedy.
[123:59.51]It's not going to be a joke.
[124:01.01]It's not going to be, oh look, Jeremy destroyed his room again.
[124:04.33]Nope, we're going to decorate the room.
[124:07.38]It's going to be a wholesome, family-friendly stream.
[124:10.44]No nonsense.
[124:11.40]We're going to have Christmas music playing.
[124:12.66]We're going to hang out.
[124:13.36]I'm going to tell you guys some of my favorite embarrassing Christmas moments.
[124:19.96]No, I'm not going to destroy my room.
[124:21.94]It's not going to happen again.
[124:22.82]Where are the stairs?
[124:25.60]Oh, fuck.
[124:36.20]I don't, I don't, like... Why did this happen?
[124:43.64]My phone just texted me.
[124:46.58]And told me... What do you think about if Roy Moore wins tomorrow?
[124:55.91]What?
[124:59.37]That wasn't a person, that was a robot just sent that to me.
[125:03.22]That was not anybody I know.
[125:06.46]That was weird.
[125:07.22]Okay.
[125:10.68]Let's go.
[125:18.56]I can't go this way, though.
[125:20.38]How do I get down the stairs?
[125:21.52]There's a staircase somewhere.
[125:22.72]Where is it?
[125:26.38]Why is your phone texting you about my state's politics?
[125:29.43]I don't know.
[125:29.99]I don't know.
[125:30.41]I'm not signed up for any of this shit.
[125:34.21]I don't have, like...
[125:35.72]Politics go!
[125:36.76]On my phone, I don't, I don't.
[125:39.52]My phone just sent me that message.
[125:41.02]It was like, hey, just in case you didn't want to know about this.
[125:45.42]Hey.
[125:50.48]Where are the stairs?
[125:54.34]Have you ever used Tinder or did you never bother since you're so short?
[125:59.56]Dude, I got a fucking girlfriend right now.
[126:02.78]I think you might be a little late here.
[126:07.09]I think he might be a little late here.
[126:10.68]There's a lot of sleeping bags in here.
[126:11.98]Okay, there are stairs.
[126:18.42]Can I set this something to map?
[126:22.38]I can't move.
[126:22.98]Oh my god.
[126:29.81]What happened?
[126:30.87]Why can I not go anywhere now?
[126:32.55]Do I have another message from the developer telling me, sorry, you can't press that button?
[126:43.96]No, the game's not paused.
[126:45.84]I'm pressing every button.
[126:47.88]No.
[126:50.70]Nope.
[126:51.83]Game should expand.
[126:57.85]Okay, well, I mean, the save point was right there, wasn't it?
[127:03.05]Wait, is there a developer here for Deadly Premonition?
[127:07.24]I don't think so.
[127:13.23]Let me just delete this and we'll get back to it.
[127:17.85]I do want to give this game like another like I want to give this game a little bit more time.
[127:25.17]This is my game.
[127:28.25]We already did the whole if the development team was in this chat and it was the only people watching my stream.
[127:33.35]We did that with crash cars, crash time, whatever it's called.
[127:35.91]One sec.
[127:38.43]Let me just reopen it.
[127:40.17]Cover your ears because this might not be good.
[127:45.03]Oh, what the fuck, dude.
[127:46.31]I just clicked on Resident Evil Revelations 2.
[127:50.75]This is not what I wanted to do.
[128:09.40]You'll see that some other time.
[128:18.79]I know, you'll see it another day, okay?
[128:25.90]Now, how did I accidentally do that?
[128:27.30]Because I have a separate list for installed games that I'm going to play on stream.
[128:34.26]There's only like three here right now.
[128:36.58]So it's not difficult for me to misclick it.
[128:44.77]Play it now.
[128:45.29]I'm not going to play it now.
[128:54.43]Is Resident Evil 7 DLC coming out tomorrow?
[128:56.33]What is it?
[128:59.25]Show your list and prove your point.
[129:00.73]Like, I will.
[129:02.17]If you really want me to.
[129:08.12]Bring back Putt-Putt.
[129:09.36]Play it or riot.
[129:10.28]No, I'm not gonna play it now.
[129:11.52]That's gonna take like six hours to play through that game.
[129:15.69]That's a whole nother stream.
[129:17.53]We're currently doing Deadly Premonition.
[129:19.99]The worst game ever.
[129:28.33]Why is this not showing up?
[129:31.41]There it is.
[129:31.89]Okay.
[129:36.03]I love how we get the South Park warning before playing the game.
[129:42.97]Load game.
[129:45.31]Resume.
[129:45.71]Would you like to restart with this file?
[129:49.64]Wait, no, no.
[129:51.14]Resume.
[129:52.08]I guess that's the right one, right?
[129:53.78]Previously during the investigation... These puppies are made...
[130:00.07]No putt-putt equals no bits.
[130:04.31]Look, we're right here.
[130:04.87]I just need to get all... Don't press any buttons.
[130:08.65]I just need to see the map.
[130:09.53]Because I need to take a la... Where do I got to go?
[130:12.04]Where's the stairs?
[130:12.68]Staircase.
[130:13.14]Staircase.
[130:14.46]We got a staircase down here.
[130:17.74]So we got to go turn around straight all the way.
[130:21.02]Bang a right.
[130:22.51]No, no, no.
[130:24.97]Backwards.
[130:26.51]Straight.
[130:27.17]Right.
[130:29.31]Right?
[130:29.65]Down?
[130:30.07]Alright, I get you.
[130:36.61]I don't get it.
[130:37.19]I don't get you.
[130:39.01]Where the fuck was I?
[130:41.71]Down that fucking hall.
[130:43.79]The hall that I went to before.
[130:44.83]The way that I was going originally.
[130:48.57]I already forgot it.
[130:49.39]And yes, I did.
[130:50.31]And whatever.
[130:51.05]Sometimes... This game is from... This is an old game from 2001.
[130:54.31]So, give me a break.
[131:01.77]It's through here and then wrap around.
[131:09.95]Looking for the stairs.
[131:11.47]There they are.
[131:14.03]Old game meets old streamer.
[131:20.16]Yeah.
[131:22.56]That's... You're correct.
[131:26.20]Alright, turn it on.
[131:30.65]Go in the freezer and see what's cooking.
[131:36.29]Doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor.
[131:38.89]Where are you?
[131:40.80]In here.
[131:42.92]Dead body.
[131:48.62]He's clearly just sitting in there.
[131:49.80]Can I knock on the window?
[131:55.37]Can I turn the lights off on him?
[132:02.13]Shit.
[132:03.59]What the fuck is this?
[132:07.59]Shelves for storing bodies.
[132:08.69]I wouldn't open these unless we really needed to.
[132:10.97]I guess I can't go in here yet.
[132:24.26]Does he have a separate door?
[132:25.60]He does.
[132:28.28]For some reason.
[132:29.64]I can't open the other one, but I can open this one.
[132:35.03]Come back at 21.
[132:43.10]Usher, sorry to keep you waiting.
[132:45.46]Ah, you made it.
[132:47.08]Let's get started, shall we?
[132:51.02]Doctor.
[132:53.72]This must be a plot sending text.
[132:54.68]This is Agent Morgan from the FBI.
[132:59.00]Nice to meet you.
[133:00.32]I'm Usher Johnson, the doctor in this hospital.
[133:02.78]FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan.
[133:04.94]This guy likes to have a... Please, call me York.
[133:08.49]Everyone calls me that.
[133:09.19]Every opportunity for this guy to... Very well, Agent York.
[133:13.73]Just tell him everybody his name.
[133:15.07]Are you a forensic practitioner?
[133:17.33]Let's just say I've dealt with corpses before.
[133:21.34]That battle of wits, by the way, did you create that yourself?
[133:24.76]Mm-hmm.
[133:25.65]I just wanted to see if our FBI agent could handle the task.
[133:29.89]I see.
[133:31.21]Well, it was pretty fun.
[133:32.21]Oh, I'm glad you liked it.
[133:37.83]We don't have much time.
[133:39.16]Can I do anything yet?
[133:40.66]Let me do something.
[133:47.68]Next time, try challenging us without obstructing an investigation.
[133:52.49]You've angered the Monarch.
[133:55.59]of just introducing characters and having you walk in doors.
[134:01.77]From the onset of rigor mortis, the stiffening of the muscles, the time of death is estimated to be between 20 and 2200 hours.
[134:10.01]That's still quite early for such a crime to take place.
[134:12.52]I'm in trouble for that.
[134:14.02]Note that there are two exterior wounds, pressure marks around the neck, and a long cut running from chest to abdomen.
[134:21.74]This is the game.
[134:22.42]That is the game.
[134:22.86]Blood marks on her right hand tell us she was gripping something round in her right hand.
[134:26.39]Hey, Jim, I fell asleep in your stream last night.
[134:27.95]Did you get over it?
[134:28.55]Yep.
[134:30.49]I did get over it.
[134:32.44]That whole entire skull is also fractured, but that is unrelated to the cause of death.
[134:38.43]It probably happened to her after she was killed.
[134:44.75]I didn't beat the game, but I got over it.
[134:47.30]Now, I first thought death by suffocation due to the marks on her neck.
[134:52.82]But after further investigation, I now have a different conclusion.
[135:00.16]The direct cause of death was a loss of blood from the wound.
[135:10.39]Hey, remember when German was stuck at the start of Get Over for three hours?
[135:13.51]That did not happen.
[135:14.95]Don't feed misinformation.
[135:18.61]She was cut up while she was still alive.
[135:19.81]She looks very much in one piece to me.
[135:23.46]How was she cut up?
[135:24.36]Are we talking about a different person?
[135:28.60]The excessive loss of blood from her internal organs is what actually killed her.
[135:34.35]Her nails are clean and with no skin cells from the attacker.
[135:39.35]She also doesn't appear to have been bound nor badly beaten.
[135:44.31]She was apparently killed without resistance.
[135:46.83]The most tragic thing, however, was that she was unable to speak her story to anyone who could hear her cries.
[136:01.96]Everyone keeps saying Twin Peaks.
[136:06.04]The perpetrator cut out Hannah's tongue.
[136:07.92]What is Twin Peaks?
[136:09.58]Well, I believe she was drugged first to phase her consciousness, and then the killer killed her.
[136:18.77]Now, the killer most likely has a deep, traumatized past.
[136:22.75]Can you get your hand off of her neck, dude?
[136:24.75]Like, what the fuck are you doing?
[136:25.55]Cutting out the tongue...
[136:31.07]suggests a very lonely individual, either that or a truly hardcore sadist.
[136:42.28]He must get off on watching women suffer, especially when they can't answer back.
[136:48.84]He watched as the blood pumped from her body.
[136:51.99]as she gradually grew cold.
[136:53.63]Music is not fitting.
[136:54.97]A case in Seattle in 1985... That's my life!
[136:57.97]That's my year!
[136:59.07]Limit your report to your findings as a doctor.
[137:02.21]Criminal profiling is my job.
[137:08.76]You're wrong, also.
[137:11.10]Anna died fully, deeply, painfully aware of what was happening to her.
[137:16.98]Tell me, what time did it stop raining on the night Anna was killed?
[137:21.30]I'm going to go fight the dog.
[137:22.84]Just before I went to bed, right after the movie on TV ended.
[137:26.50]So around 1 a.m.
[137:29.32]What movie was it?
[137:31.10]An American Werewolf in London.
[137:32.62]Nice.
[137:33.20]That's a movie.
[137:34.32]Directed by John Landis, 1981.
[137:37.12]So the rain stopped accompanied by the ending song.
[137:40.24]He knows every movie.
[137:43.11]George, would you mind if I examined Anna myself?
[137:46.73]What more do you hope to find?
[137:51.72]I'm sure I mentioned that I have a personal interest in cases like these.
[137:56.49]So we're going to look.
[138:01.49]I thought I was going to examine the body, not this guy.
[138:10.73]Why?
[138:11.73]I already know who this guy is.
[138:12.55]Why am I examining him?
[138:15.57]Oh.
[138:18.67]Dude, her eyes were removed!
[138:19.69]Lookit!
[138:20.47]Somebody replaced her eyes with fucking caterpillars!
[138:24.39]How do I... What are you?
[138:27.07]Okay.
[138:39.28]I'm looking really closely.
[138:42.72]Traces have evaporated liquid around the eyes like a caterpillar.
[138:46.17]She must have cried before she was murdered.
[138:49.89]I'm going to get up and grab these.
[138:53.63]She's neatly wearing fake fingernails.
[138:57.19]That was not supposed to be a fucking joke.
[139:00.82]That was supposed to be a terrible observation.
[139:04.12]What about the mark on her hand?
[139:06.64]She's holding something.
[139:09.58]Circular with a relief shaped like a peace mark.
[139:14.90]Anna's body is lying on the table.
[139:16.24]I'm about to turn her into fucking Wolverine.
[139:19.80]Alright, now what?
[139:27.18]That was the most pointless thing ever.
[139:31.62]From her lack of resistance, I'd say that Anna's injuries happened very quickly.
[139:36.93]Unable to speak, she was then left to cry herself to death.
[139:42.67]Ghoul feet.
[139:43.07]It's like it's all starting to come together.
[139:45.72]The perpetrator stayed with her for at least two hours.
[139:49.82]No, it's called somebody that has all the blood removed from their body.
[139:53.14]At the estimated time of her death.
[139:55.10]After you die, your blood evaporates.
[139:57.32]But you can still see tear marks on her cheeks.
[139:58.88]Does that happen?
[140:01.12]That means she was... Your blood like evaporates, right?
[140:04.32]When you're dead?
[140:06.26]Don't they suck it out of you?
[140:07.84]Alright, if you were to die and just be lying on the ground, would you still have blood in your body?
[140:17.72]Wouldn't it turn into jelly?
[140:19.06]Wouldn't it evaporate?
[140:20.74]In fact, it's more likely it was simply chopped off.
[140:25.95]Usher, are you a passionate man?
[140:29.15]Well, not particularly, but I am man enough.
[140:34.89]No, I'm talking about the doctor.
[140:37.51]Don't you go in and they set you up to a machine and suck out all your blood and guts and stuff?
[140:42.14]Don't they turn you into a stuffed animal?
[140:45.96]I don't know.
[140:46.38]The perpetrator is just like you.
[140:49.22]He's passionate about women.
[140:53.14]He's a passionate kisser.
[141:00.30]taxidermy humans you know you know I'm just obviously just making like a joke here but like you know what I'm talking about but this is still a big league they pump you full of like worcestershire sauce isn't that what happens in south park
[141:25.12]What are we doing?
[141:35.30]Ah, she jumped out an almond.
[141:37.04]That's how she died, guys.
[141:37.78]I know I said I was passionate.
[141:53.48]But you can't think I did this.
[141:55.42]Long cutscene.
[141:56.90]That's not why I'm assuming command, George.
[141:59.26]You're a suspect just as much as every other passionate man on Earth.
[142:02.20]Embalming.
[142:02.76]I'll show you something.
[142:03.72]Yeah, like embalming fluid.
[142:10.31]What?
[142:10.67]Alright, what is he doing?
[142:19.22]As you can see, I have quite a collection of monster fingernails.
[142:23.35]Some would call it a fucking sick fetish.
[142:26.21]There you go.
[142:26.83]I call it life.
[142:27.55]Amazing, huh?
[142:29.11]I'm sure you have a lot of questions, but most of the details are top secret.
[142:36.95]George, Emily, we should be going.
[142:40.35]No need to stay here any longer.
[142:42.63]Okay.
[142:44.21]I have to sign the release.
[142:45.87]Just give me a moment.
[142:46.61]They're not all in one bag because he's reliving the same days over and over again in his head.
[142:50.83]Taking any longer down here.
[142:55.51]He's doing this all his head.
[142:56.83]This is like the eighth time he's done this.
[142:59.37]His rook takes your queen.
[143:01.24]Then your knight takes rook.
[143:03.84]And checkmate.
[143:06.58]Huh?
[143:07.12]You got me.
[143:13.58]No, it's not like... Okay, imagine Groundhog Day, but... Like, Bill Murray doesn't know he's in Groundhog Day.
[143:19.41]My first victory in the Grandmaster rankings.
[143:33.57]Uh-oh.
[143:37.85]Uh-oh.
[143:39.77]The world is different.
[143:51.62]Zack, they're here.
[143:54.14]I'm going to look up the Wikipedia at the end of this game.
[143:56.50]I want to look up all the plot points.
[144:02.01]That's what I'm going to do after this.
[144:03.39]I want to know what's going on here.
[144:12.10]Got my gun.
[144:12.58]What do you mean, no?
[144:19.90]Can I get out of here?
[144:22.89]I think I have to shoot this wall.
[144:31.41]Beat the game and you'll know Zack.
[144:32.89]Zack is like probably some weird... I can't go in here.
[144:41.30]Somebody in here.
[144:42.38]Somebody's in here.
[144:46.08]Not quite.
[144:46.56]I'm gonna get jump scared.
[144:49.40]I know it.
[144:55.71]Running in slow motion.
[145:01.56]Interesting thing to see.
[145:08.93]One of these is going to jump up.
[145:09.85]Someone's going to be underneath it.
[145:16.35]I'm going to open this one.
[145:18.47]Here it comes.
[145:23.04]What?
[145:23.76]Ten auto... These bullets don't do anything, though.
[145:26.16]Is there another gun?
[145:27.00]What?
[145:32.04]There you are.
[145:35.30]Door has to be... Okay.
[145:46.48]Let's keep going.
[145:52.28]Yes, I know you're right there.
[145:53.60]Oh, sorry.
[146:02.39]Don't shoot the hospital staff!
[146:09.37]Easy.
[146:21.21]For what it is, this game is very strange.
[146:30.41]When did Resident Evil 4 come out?
[146:35.46]It's very clear that, I mean, what's the superior game here?
[146:38.31]Amazing.
[146:40.79]Resident... Resident 4.
[146:44.25]I wanna... see how this one holds up, though.
[146:49.83]Great.
[146:50.13]Yes.
[146:50.33]Alive still?
[146:51.27]Nice shot.
[147:08.53]This game is very low budget, unlike Resident Evil 4.
[147:13.65]Didn't, like, three people make Resident Evil 4?
[147:15.88]Great.
[147:21.74]Resident Evil 4 was made by, like, two guys.
[147:24.64]And a dog.
[147:31.29]The two guys, like, developed the game, and they trained the dog to go get him beers every, like, 40 minutes.
[147:39.22]Oh, goddammit.
[147:41.95]Yes.
[147:44.93]Yes.
[147:45.93]Amazing.
[147:51.77]Yes.
[147:52.15]Yes, please... die.
[147:54.28]Please die.
[147:58.08]Keep the gun out.
[147:58.62]Don't keep... Why would you put it away?
[147:59.94]I'm gonna collect another person here.
[148:09.69]Whoa!
[148:10.91]Whoa!
[148:11.01]Somebody behind me, somebody behind me.
[148:18.98]Ah!
[148:19.48]Fuck.
[148:23.66]You're moving too fast, I don't like you.
[148:25.22]Hey, hey!
[148:26.85]Nice shot.
[148:28.27]Nice shot.
[148:30.17]This game is scaring me, only because they just move so strangely.
[148:41.61]Hey, nice shot.
[148:45.83]Made it to the exit.
[148:46.61]Amazing.
[148:52.39]Okay.
[148:55.95]Anything else?
[148:56.37]Probably a metal down here.
[148:59.17]Or not.
[149:00.07]No metal.
[149:04.89]Why?
[149:10.83]God, don't fucking think about that shit.
[149:13.15]I hate that.
[149:13.81]Don't do that to me.
[149:16.23]That teleport is the scariest damn thing.
[149:19.62]It's the only really, truly horrifying thing in the game, besides the giant dog.
[149:23.24]I'm gonna go over here.
[149:28.74]What is this?
[149:30.26]I need a key card, obviously.
[149:41.30]The op Hopefully the post is good, and it's not a repost op you fuck I'm stopping halfway through that one.
[149:53.53]Sorry That one is done.
[149:57.69]I didn't that one doesn't count because I didn't even finish it.
[150:00.05]Oh
[150:10.56]Drink one of these coffees.
[150:14.11]Smugs and a cigarette.
[150:19.29]I don't need that.
[150:20.67]Um, how am I out of places to put anything?
[150:22.91]Alright, um, so I got a lot of shit for this.
[150:33.39]But I'd like for you guys to look at the screen.
[150:37.15]A lot of you guys gave me shit.
[150:39.51]But did you see that that... See?
[150:42.25]This is what happened.
[150:43.07]Remember I shot the flare in the air and everybody called me a moron because I tried to click on crackers?
[150:50.62]Look.
[150:51.56]It's a bug in the game.
[150:53.36]Because I'm clearly selecting worm right now.
[150:58.06]So... Come on.
[151:00.74]Give me some credit here. ...
[151:08.10]Give me that coffee.
[151:15.02]Director's cut.
[151:22.10]I don't have any... Whatever.
[151:25.32]I can take it now, can't I?
[151:26.40]I just drank one.
[151:33.51]What's next?
[151:34.73]Oh, yeah.
[151:35.23]The scary guy that's gonna jump up underneath.
[151:37.03]It's gonna be a boss fight.
[151:41.86]I have to fight the girl, the girl's gonna tell me her story, and then I have to shoot her.
[151:45.56]It's the keycard.
[151:53.96]Queen of Hearts.
[151:56.92]Mm-hmm.
[151:57.70]Yeah, yeah, of course.
[151:58.90]Why wouldn't you spawn two enemies?
[152:03.43]Which one teleports?
[152:04.15]Nice shot.
[152:08.03]I don't... Because they teleport.
[152:10.49]I don't like it.
[152:12.37]I really don't like it.
[152:18.32]Just trying to teleport and it's not happening.
[152:25.47]Where am I?
[152:28.65]That's what happens when you walk backwards like that.
[152:30.61]You're bound and run into a wall.
[152:37.39]Drop something.
[152:38.01]What did you drop there?
[152:41.35]Put it in the toolbox.
[152:50.00]Keycard.
[152:56.16]Where was that other door?
[152:58.54]Down here?
[153:02.02]I don't think it was down here.
[153:03.26]Maybe it was?
[153:05.61]No, it wasn't.
[153:10.13]Shit!
[153:10.73]It was the other way.
[153:20.55]Don't run out of stamina.
[153:22.15]Not now.
[153:27.96]I just charged to my card.
[153:29.18]I don't know what I'm fucking saying.
[153:31.34]Get in there.
[153:36.04]Spooky game?
[153:36.76]Facecam?
[153:37.46]Nah, this ain't a spooky game.
[153:40.26]This is a fake spooky game.
[153:44.44]A lot of stuff in here.
[153:47.18]Why do I feel like this is a very major part of the game that I'm about to do?
[153:57.22]Please don't do accents.
[154:00.92]Why?
[154:04.68]Film in red.
[154:15.02]No, I'm not going to... I'm not gonna... Why would I... Why do you want a face cam for this game?
[154:20.32]You don't want that.
[154:23.39]Put item away.
[154:35.48]I can't even fucking move down.
[154:37.13]Oh my god, director's cut.
[154:41.49]Yeah, more like director just signed the bottom of the paper.
[154:46.73]And released game.
[154:50.99]Deadly Premonition, director's cut.
[154:55.10]Dev team threw together a PC release and CEO signed bottom.
[155:03.26]I can sleep.
[155:04.04]No, I don't wanna sleep.
[155:07.98]Need a hair status?
[155:11.03]Nah.
[155:15.49]A big survival knife.
[155:19.05]Don't I already have one of these?
[155:19.97]Yeah, you're gonna have to take a guess to know what my hair is like.
[155:24.75]You'll never know.
[155:29.39]Turn on the TV.
[155:34.23]Should I take a 12-hour nap?
[155:37.78]Let's save it.
[155:38.46]I feel like I'm about to do something weird here.
[155:41.00]If I go to bed, isn't this all gonna go away?
[155:42.82]I kinda don't want that to happen, do I?
[155:45.23]Let's just save it and see what happens.
[156:00.40]Through the door.
[156:00.92]I don't think there's anything here.
[156:10.63]You wanna see?
[156:11.13]You wanna turn on the facecam for a minute?
[156:13.81]Maybe I will.
[156:15.33]If you're good.
[156:17.04]If you're all good boys and girls, I'll turn the facecam on.
[156:25.08]What ever happened to the don't breathe?
[156:32.92]I guess I'm not breathing.
[156:34.64]But I'm not breathing, so can they hear me?
[156:42.59]I think I'm alright.
[156:45.18]Alright, honestly, in that sh- I'm out of breath already.
[156:49.76]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[156:51.54]Dude, me and the child!
[156:53.18]Me and that little fucking kid, but I held that breath for like three minutes!
[156:56.34]Oh lord.
[156:59.76]Duh!
[157:04.58]I can't run!
[157:05.16]I can't run!
[157:05.80]I can't run!
[157:08.07]I can run now.
[157:13.89]That was bullshit, man.
[157:15.87]You saw how long me and that kid held our breath.
[157:18.03]Amazing.
[157:21.66]It was like a full three minutes.
[157:28.32]Too many cigarettes.
[157:39.39]Took a little too much time to prepare for that one.
[157:44.35]Where's this other guy?
[157:50.41]There you are.
[157:54.42]You ain't gonna get it out of me.
[157:56.18]He's trying to scratch his back.
[158:06.66]Why do they all insist on crawling backwards?
[158:10.31]Good question.
[158:14.06]Smashed wheelchair.
[158:14.88]I think I see bullet holes.
[158:16.20]That's not good.
[158:18.26]Instead of pushing it this way, probably should go the other way.
[158:22.48]This is not made with the best craftsmanship.
[158:31.71]Somebody threw that together.
[158:37.85]Lots of blood.
[158:41.86]Should I just go to sleep?
[158:43.38]I feel like that's the goal here.
[158:44.46]No, it's not.
[158:45.02]There's a cutscene.
[158:49.41]One bullet, back of the head.
[158:51.47]He's obviously a monster.
[158:52.49]Of course.
[159:10.13]What else would be happening?
[159:19.34]Can I ask you guys something?
[159:21.26]Did I solve the... Yes, I'd like to solve the puzzle, please.
[159:29.50]Is this me in the real world right now?
[159:33.06]I'm having like a mental breakdown and I'm killing people in the real world, but I think I'm in like some weird zombie world.
[159:39.70]Great.
[159:40.94]I'd like to solve the puzzle.
[159:53.29]Probably.
[159:56.80]That's dumb.
[159:57.40]You're dumb.
[159:59.06]Hey!
[160:07.86]This is the part of the game where the developer was strong-armed into adding gameplay?
[160:17.18]That's completely wrong.
[160:23.20]Yeah.
[160:26.04]Why not play the game and find out?
[160:27.26]What a genius idea.
[160:29.82]That's a pretty good idea.
[160:30.69]You're right.
[160:35.51]Alright, got another keycard.
[160:49.88]This is for a different door.
[160:50.94]Am I enjoying it so far?
[160:57.60]I think so.
[160:59.38]It's interesting enough where... I'm... Let's put it this way.
[161:04.82]I ain't not liking it, you know?
[161:06.98]I think it's a fairly interesting game.
[161:12.33]Key to the entrance.
[161:17.03]I think so.
[161:28.26]Alright, well, what's the correct way?
[161:31.22]Where's the entrance?
[161:34.94]This looks like it could be an entrance.
[161:39.01]Or at least a place for me to use the key.
[161:41.57]Yep.
[161:54.66]Yeah, I ain't saying I like it, but I ain't saying I don't like it.
[161:56.50]This is the best way I can put it.
[162:03.67]This is a claustrophobic room.
[162:04.97]Get me out of the corner.
[162:12.98]Can't leave the hospital.
[162:18.66]$25 game, $119 worm.
[162:20.04]That guy has a gun.
[162:27.99]They can hold guns now?
[162:29.19]He's holding the shotgun upside down.
[162:34.69]I feel like I should be concerned about this.
[162:43.37]Um...
[162:50.14]I'm gonna get a quick time... Red Dead Redemption thing here.
[162:54.94]Yes.
[162:57.30]Bullseye.
[163:02.87]Does that mean I get a shotgun now?
[163:07.47]Whoa!
[163:09.07]He hit me.
[163:10.39]He actually hit me with that one.
[163:12.35]That took a lot of health off.
[163:14.99]That was not just a little joke.
[163:19.35]That was a chunk of health.
[163:22.15]Here he is around the corner right now.
[163:25.83]I need to heal.
[163:26.41]I'm gonna shoot him right now.
[163:38.16]Oh, the gun's disappearing.
[163:45.83]That's a lot of damage.
[163:46.53]Is that a gun?
[163:47.97]No, it's just shotgun shells.
[163:51.43]Whoop!
[164:02.43]More shotgun shells?
[164:04.83]I'm assuming I don't have infinite ammo with this thing.
[164:12.26]That would make a lot of sense.
[164:19.54]He just looked like a kid I went to fucking high school with.
[164:22.38]That was weird.
[164:27.92]The black screen when you pick up an item is kind of that old school Resident Evil bullshit.
[164:38.43]Remember when you used to open a door in Resident Evil?
[164:43.03]It would go to black and it would open the door really slowly.
[164:47.63]I hated that.
[164:51.79]Also, I think my character had an aneurysm and the game stopped.
[164:54.91]Okay.
[165:22.60]I can't alt-tap either.
[165:28.09]Oh lord.
[165:28.97]Well.
[165:30.43]Looks like we're going to have to force quit.
[165:34.67]Is that even going to work?
[165:37.97]This is where the director cut the game.
[165:40.88]This is where the director cut the game.
[165:42.76]That's the best joke all night.
[165:47.84]Nice one.
[165:48.62]That was the best joke all night.
[165:52.39]I should play this on PS3.
[165:54.69]My PS3 is not... I can't even close this shit.
[166:01.61]I have a black screen forever.
[166:03.13]There's nothing I can do about it.
[166:04.65]Hi.
[166:14.72]I look a little dirty.
[166:15.76]I look a little dirty.
[166:17.10]It's alright.
[166:17.78]There you go.
[166:21.44]There's your face cam.
[166:25.23]Give me a moment while I try to figure out what the hell I'm going to do here.
[166:27.60]Because this is hard locked.
[166:33.66]I might have to play another game on my other monitor.
[166:40.08]Because I don't have access to my main screen right now.
[166:43.95]This is not good.
[166:47.09]Control-Alt-Delete does nothing.
[166:49.85]Ending task does nothing.
[166:51.33]The task manager is not... I can't even access it.
[166:58.92]So, well, this is a predicament.
[167:06.39]We had a good run.
[167:13.78]Call the director.
[167:16.26]I can't even open up anything on Steam either because I can't pull it over here.
[167:22.98]What happens if I do this?
[167:28.41]What screen is it going to be on?
