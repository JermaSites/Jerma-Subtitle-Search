[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.31]I made it.
[00:15.84]Hold on, Reggie.
[00:19.16]...low to on high.
[00:21.44]Where will Nintendo Switch take you next?
[00:24.26]To a smashing Invitational cheered by fans and challengers?
[00:28.76]Or on a journey?
[00:30.07]through verdant fields and viridian cities.
[00:32.79]Hold on, I gotta get in the right spot.
[00:34.53]I can't be on facecam right now, by the way.
[00:37.60]I, like, just got out of the shower, and I put on a, I'm like the couple that just got out of the shower.
[00:43.20]A few weeks ago, we showed you Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu and Pokémon Let's Go Eevee.
[00:48.88]A grand new Pokémon adventure through the vibrant Kanto region where your partner, Pikachu or Eevee, is always by your side.
[00:57.97]Add the transformative power of Nintendo Switch and you can play as you like, anywhere you like.
[01:04.81]or for the first time in this series, catch or battle Pokémon on one system with a friend.
[01:10.91]You can even transfer a Pokémon into the game from Pokémon Go.
[01:14.63]Wait, you can transfer a fucking Pokémon?
[01:16.72]This is a Pokeball Plus.
[01:20.24]You can use it like a Joy-Con controller with Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee, or play the entire game with it alone.
[01:28.56]You can put a Pokémon into the Pokeball Plus, then bring it with you.
[01:33.82]Oh, wow.
[01:34.50]Sounds like there's already one inside.
[01:36.32]It's the mythical Pokémon Mew.
[01:38.71]Mew comes exclusive with every Pokeball Plus and can join you on your journey through the game.
[01:43.59]Shut up, Jeremy.
[01:44.25]Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu, Pokémon Let's Go Eevee, and the Pokeball Plus will be available on November 16th.
[01:51.73]Discover new friends and challenges as you explore this mysterious and enchanting world.
[01:57.20]Don't tap on the glass, Reggie.
[01:58.32]Wherever you go, with whoever you like, only on Nintendo Switch.
[02:03.20]Now, let's check out something else we can't wait to show you.
[02:07.06]A Jerma with a greedy businessman haircut.
[02:10.22]Okay, you ready for this?
[02:11.80]I need a cigar.
[02:13.60]Alright.
[02:14.06]Come on, give me some announcements.
[02:16.62]Don't even think about it.
[02:18.90]Come on, man.
[02:20.33]All or nothing.
[02:21.13]Something cool.
[02:23.68]Mario Party!
[02:24.92]Mario Party!
[02:27.11]I'm so not ready for this.
[02:28.53]I didn't even tweak that.
[02:29.67]Hey, what's up?
[02:30.57]What are y'all doing?
[02:31.53]I'm playing.
[02:32.39]I have a 90s villain haircut.
[02:33.57]Hold on, I can't even see.
[02:35.49]That's going to go too fast.
[02:36.47]Let's do it this way.
[02:38.67]We need to have, like, some angles.
[02:40.93]OK.
[02:42.02]That looks cool.
[02:42.62]Ready?
[02:43.30]Do it.
[02:45.47]Oh, game on.
[02:46.93]I want one of these.
[02:48.07]But, like, I don't at the same time.
[02:49.83]Is that, like, weird for me to say?
[02:54.43]Really?
[02:54.97]Come on.
[02:55.49]Oh, no!
[02:56.57]You know, I, like, I don't fucking want a Switch.
[02:59.10]Are you guys ready to do this?
[03:00.06]But, I mean, who doesn't want to take this up camping?
[03:03.42]Alright, ready?
[03:06.46]Yeah.
[03:10.85]What happened?
[03:11.93]Wow.
[03:12.89]One more.
[03:13.53]One more.
[03:14.09]We should do one more.
[03:15.11]Why is everybody so cool?
[03:18.51]Everybody in these commercials, Nintendo always has people dressed really trendy.
[03:25.10]He always has them.
[03:26.22]Nintendo, it's the guy, right, that I'm talking about.
[03:29.76]They always dress really trendy.
[03:31.06]They have really expensive clothes.
[03:32.56]They're really, like, really, like, attractive people.
[03:34.48]What was that?
[03:35.64]What was that?
[03:40.63]Where's this guy?
[03:41.95]You know what I mean?
[03:43.27]In his bathrobe.
[03:45.23]Drinking his fucking sewer tea.
[03:48.53]Where's him?
[03:50.89]Not that attractive.
[03:52.53]Attractive enough, right?
[03:53.57]I could be in the commercial.
[03:58.53]And by the way...
[04:00.55]Spider-Man.
[04:01.87]The deal is not on the table anymore.
[04:06.86]I was talking to my ear and shit.
[04:10.74]I couldn't even do the joke.
[04:11.98]I was gonna do something else.
[04:12.96]Zelda.
[04:27.10]Fire Emblem's cool.
[04:31.54]You know, I've never played Fire Emblem, I'm just saying it's cool.
[04:33.87]You know what?
[04:34.65]You know what?
[04:35.51]Fuck Fire Emblems.
[04:40.20]I'll tell you why.
[04:41.30]Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is the only game you should ever play.
[04:44.66]You understand?
[04:47.00]Don't play any other video game that has tiles.
[04:49.71]Hey, can I smoke in here?
[04:51.89]Whoa!
[05:08.53]I should just start, like, smoking.
[05:10.33]I don't even smoke cigarettes, but I should just have a lit cigarette in my hand.
[05:23.09]What I hear Fire Emblem music, really, it's a really good song.
[05:28.29]That's what I'm told.
[05:30.77]Into the dawn, oh, I wish I could stay.
[05:37.52]Do you dare to walk this path with me?
[05:40.49]One misstep and we fall to our ruin.
[05:43.93]So take your first step.
[05:45.01]It's now or never.
[05:52.03]I will return here someday, my teacher.
[05:55.18]Promise me that you won't forget me.
[05:57.84]Be louder?
[05:58.48]I accidentally turned myself down because I was too excited about this.
[06:04.62]By the way, pre-recorded Nintendo?
[06:06.64]Why don't they get shit for this?
[06:20.13]Fortnite's coming to Switch.
[06:23.69]Who didn't see that coming?
[06:30.93]Look, okay, my mother's a teacher.
[06:32.97]Listen.
[06:34.09]My mother told me that they already have trouble with kids in school only talking about Fortnite and trying to play Fortnite during school.
[06:43.32]You want to give these kids a device that they can bring around and play with their friends in the cafeteria and shit?
[06:48.06]This is gonna make it way worse.
[06:54.68]Nintendo is just enabling all these kids now.
[06:58.68]I can't wait to drop off the battle bus and meet some of you on the battlefield in Fortnite.
[07:04.33]And on Nintendo Switch, you can have the complete Battle Royale experience.
[07:08.95]I can't wait.
[07:09.31]Reggie's going to school with these kids.
[07:12.19]Reggie goes to school at the same middle school, I guess.
[07:14.53]Available at 10 a.m.
[07:15.96]Pacific time today.
[07:17.54]Nintendo Switch, a home console where you can access a full range of games content, including a wealth of groundbreaking games.
[07:25.22]Weirdly enough, I've been held back 41 times.
[07:28.44]Your support for indie games on Nintendo Switch has been inspiring.
[07:33.40]And to all of you, as well as all of the developers behind these riches.
[07:37.46]I can't get over the whole geometry thing.
[07:40.07]Arithmetic.
[07:40.59]I don't understand it.
[07:41.53]Thank you.
[07:42.71]Let's pull back the curtain on a few more, including two we're showing for the first time here today.
[07:49.68]Aspiring chefs, ready your cleavers, pots, and cutting boards in Overcooked 2, a sequel that's brimming with more recipes, characters, kitchens, and white-knuckle mayhem.
[08:01.62]Prepare for the ultimate cook-off with new features like the ability to throw ingredients, kitchens that can change on the fly,
[08:09.87]and with Nintendo Switch, the opportunity to bake, barbecue, or broil with another player in wireless, local, and online play.
[08:18.91]Save the world from clumsy cooking when Team 17's frantic food juggler arrives on August 7th.
[08:26.76]Hop on a snail, hoard berries, or wipe out the enemy's queen to claim victory in Killer Queen Black.
[08:34.14]Redesigned from the ground up, Liquid Bit and Bumble Bear Games' acclaimed arcade extravaganza that became the multiplayer phenomenon is coming to Nintendo Switch.
[08:45.19]And for the first time on console, two teams of up to four each can square off in exciting battles.
[08:51.96]Play it first on Nintendo Switch later this year.
[08:55.74]And finally, venture through the mysterious subterranean landscapes of a vast forgotten kingdom in Teen Cherry's Hollow Knight.
[09:04.72]An action adventure filled with gripping combat and haunting secrets.
[09:09.45]Hand-drawn characters and sublime scenery abound in this sweeping platformer that offers endless hours of intricate exploration.
[09:18.41]We revealed earlier this year that Hollow Knight was coming to Nintendo Switch.
[09:22.97]And I'm pleased to announce that the game...
[09:26.14]All the previous downloadable content is available on the Nintendo eShop starting today.
[09:32.98]These are just a few of the terrific indie games you can play in the months ahead.
[09:37.91]After this presentation, stay tuned for Nintendo Treehouse Live, streaming right from the E3 show floor, where our Nintendo game experts will give you a closer look at some of these games and more.
[09:51.73]And I personally cannot wait to watch
[09:54.17]As intrepid challengers test their mettle in our Splatoon 2 World Championship and Super Smash Bros.
[10:01.13]Invitational 2018, the action starts immediately following Nintendo Treehouse Live.
[10:08.31]Before we move on, I have an important update on a game I know fans have been looking forward to.
[10:14.24]Octopath Traveler from Square Enix is coming exclusively for Nintendo Switch on July 13th.
[10:21.46]and you can download a brand new demo for the game from the Nintendo eShop on June 14th.
[10:27.16]What is that game?
[10:27.80]What is it?
[10:28.14]Octopath?
[10:28.86]What is that?
[10:29.14]Let's take another action-packed look at some more experiences.
[10:32.37]No, tell me more about that.
[10:33.23]Coming soon to Nintendo Switch.
[10:35.69]That looks fucking cool.
[10:37.19]I like that one.
[10:41.33]And here comes Andrew WK.
[10:42.89]Starbucks.
[10:47.68]Starbucks.
[10:52.03]This stupid fucking mobile game.
[10:55.82]Another Minecraft, I guess.
[10:58.30]Just look at all these things we're putting on Switch that you've played before.
[11:06.04]Mario and Rabbids Kingdom Battle.
[11:09.60]Nick's Ark.
[11:11.73]No, that's just Ark, but they made it in Minecraft.
[11:14.79]Look, if you take away the dinosaurs from Ark and you add pixels, it just becomes Minecraft.
[11:19.41]What?
[11:19.67]I don't understand.
[11:21.09]Why'd they do that?
[11:29.32]Captain Toad's Treasure Grove 2.
[11:31.24]Is that one?
[11:46.23]FIFA 18 is coming, don't you worry.
[11:48.79]FIFA 19 will be there.
[11:51.59]Arc, actual Arc.
[11:53.83]Fallout Shelter, yeah, we can go back.
[12:06.06]Dark Souls Remastered Summer 2018.
[12:09.12]Although everybody already can play it now.
[12:15.33]I might as well be saying, wow.
[12:42.96]Hi, everyone.
[12:44.84]I'm Shinya Takahashi of Nintendo.
[12:47.07]I hope you enjoyed what you've seen.
[12:48.41]I thought I had my own stream playing.
[12:51.41]People pull their Nintendo Switch systems from their bags to play, even when they have only a little bit of free time.
[12:57.79]Every time I see that, I can't help but smile.
[13:02.36]At Nintendo, we approach development with the goal of delivering new and unique games to surprise people all over the world, and we're thankful for the many publishing partners also making games for Nintendo Switch.
[13:14.38]Today we shared just a small portion of what we're currently working on.
[13:18.16]We hope you will look forward to what's coming next on Nintendo Switch.
[13:22.86]Now, it's time to share information on a certain title.
[13:26.20]I'll turn it over to someone I think you know.
[13:29.56]Miyamoto.
[13:31.04]Miyamoto.
[13:31.58]No, Sakurai.
[13:35.45]Hi.
[13:36.13]I'm Masahiro Sakurai from Sora Limited.
[13:38.63]Today, I'd like to introduce you to the new Super Smash Bros.
[13:41.67]game for the Nintendo Switch.
[13:44.15]As you may know, Super Smash Bros.
[13:46.17]is an action game about smashing beloved games off the screen.
[13:53.28]Many fighters have appeared in this series.
[13:55.64]I'm sure you are all eager to find out who will be joining the roster this time.
[14:02.34]So we made a video to showcase some fighters appearing in the game.
[14:05.68]It's a tank top.
[14:06.80]It's a giant tank top.
[14:08.04]The number next to each fighter signifies the order in which they joined the Super Smash Brothers series.
[14:13.83]I was going to sneeze.
[14:15.25]Please take a look.
[14:16.13]I was going to sneeze on camera.
[14:17.85]Just only sneeze and then turn it off.
[14:20.71]I missed it.
[14:21.78]Hold on.
[14:22.06]This is important.
[14:26.58]Mario's in it.
[14:27.10]There he is.
[14:32.42]I bet you, you know what?
[14:33.04]I bet you Luigi's in it too.
[14:40.35]Kirby, come on, show us.
[14:43.53]Show us Tails, man.
[14:44.57]Come on, put Tails in the game.
[14:45.71]He deserves to be there.
[14:49.53]Put Tails, Knuckles, Amy.
[14:54.71]What are the other ones?
[14:57.71]Big Fish, Big Cat.
[15:02.93]Why are they skipping numbers?
[15:09.30]Pac-Man in this one again or no?
[15:16.98]There he is Toad?
[15:24.89]That Toad?
[15:25.45]There you go guys, Toad unconfirmed
[15:31.49]You don't get to play as Toad.
[15:32.91]Sorry.
[15:35.03]That is a Splatoon person, yeah.
[15:43.93]Ice Climbers?
[15:45.05]Whatever.
[15:47.11]That's old news.
[15:48.89]We're looking for a big reveal.
[15:53.12]Nessa's... I guess Ryu's just coming back.
[16:01.33]Oh, Snake is definitely not coming back.
[16:06.14]Cloud... I didn't even... Hold on!
[16:12.08]Oh, he is coming back!
[16:17.13]Everyone is here.
[16:18.27]Wait, hold on.
[16:23.73]Did they just... Is this every single character they've ever made is gonna be in this?
[16:35.77]Yeah, it's gonna be every single character.
[16:37.29]There's Bayonetta.
[16:48.83]There's 54, 50, there's like 60, 62 characters!
[16:57.44]Every single video game characters in the game.
[17:06.00]You're even going back down.
[17:07.18]I'm telling you, if I see Glover, I swear to God.
[17:11.79]Thank God he's back.
[17:16.90]Oh, here comes Gex.
[17:20.78]All three Battletoads.
[17:37.50]Please tell me that they just unconfirmed Luigi by putting him in an egg for eternity.
[17:44.80]Alright, what about the big reveal?
[17:46.52]Who's the new character we haven't seen yet?
[17:48.34]They're gonna show him.
[17:50.00]They're gonna zoom in on his face.
[17:52.61]There he is!
[17:58.47]That's right.
[17:59.47]Every fighter in Super Smash Bros.
[18:01.27]history is joining the battle.
[18:05.21]Indeed, absolutely every Super Smash Bros.
[18:08.11]fighter ever is in this game, whether they were originally DLC or only appeared once in the past.
[18:13.57]Are you fucking kidding me?
[18:14.43]We believe that's what players want, so we made the impossible possible.
[18:19.17]Any way you slice it, this one has the most Smash for your butt.
[18:22.71]That's kind of insane.
[18:23.63]Simply put, this is the biggest crossover in gaming history.
[18:27.53]Once again, worlds will collide.
[18:30.62]Even so, your starting roster may be as small as the original Nintendo 64 game.
[18:35.03]We've streamlined the conditions for unlocking fighters and we want to make the process interesting so it feels like you're constantly recruiting popular characters to your side.
[18:45.06]Eight-player battles are also making a return.
[18:49.94]See what happens when you pit many different fighters against one another.
[18:54.19]most unbalanced video game.
[18:56.61]Now let's take a closer look at certain fighters by highlighting how they've changed since their last appearance.
[19:04.26]Mario's still easy to use, but we did add a little something for someone from his latest adventure.
[19:11.64]He can also wear his wedding and builder outfits.
[19:18.56]Link dons his champion's tunic from The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
[19:22.96]His bombs are now remotely detonated, and his final smash unleashes ancient arrows.
[19:30.32]He can also wear Link's familiar tunic of the wild.
[19:36.06]Although it's been a while, the two-in-one fighter, the Ice Climbers, are back.
[19:42.82]Work together with Nana.
[19:44.36]Once she's gone, you're in serious trouble.
[19:47.32]Nah, I've seen plenty of pros lose Nana and win the game.
[19:49.97]The two different versions are even voiced a little differently.
[19:52.97]Prepare yourself.
[19:53.75]Prepare yourself.
[19:54.89]We now have the female version of Pikachu complete with a heart-shaped tail.
[19:59.23]Did you notice Pikachu Libre is a girl?
[20:16.33]Fox's design is now based on Star Fox Zero, and his Final Smash has received an overhaul.
[20:23.04]This time, Final Smashes are straight to the point, so you can get right back to fighting.
[20:31.96]Valko's Final Smash features an unorthodox ship formation that's more unruly than Fox's.
[20:38.17]Either way, its landmaster has been retired.
[20:45.26]In one-on-one fights, Ryu will always face his opponents, just like in his original game appearances.
[20:52.10]It's a small touch that reduces accidental command inputs.
[20:55.22]I feel like that's going to be a big deal.
[20:57.76]Charge moves, like Samus' charge shot, can now power up a hitter.
[21:02.81]You can cancel with jump or dodge, but you'll be open to attack.
[21:09.56]Marth's dancing blade is faster and it's easier to unleash one after another.
[21:13.99]This holds true for Roy and Lucina too.
[21:17.19]In addition, Marth is now fully voiced in English.
[21:20.31]Keep your eyes open!
[21:21.35]By Jerma985.
[21:25.12]What if this is a big deal and I never told you?
[21:26.98]Veteran fighter Snake is sneaking back into the fray.
[21:31.28]It's been 10 years since his last appearance in the series, so we can finally make some new dream matches come true.
[21:37.59]Of course, Shadow Moses Island is back too.
[21:40.07]Wow.
[21:44.75]King Dedede's Final Smash is basically a cage fight where he unleashes missiles and a jet hammer.
[21:53.64]What you mean is a cool animation to do the same thing.
[21:56.14]Pichu is also returning from Super Smash Bros.
[21:58.42]Melee.
[21:59.47]Its electric shock still damaged itself too, so be careful.
[22:04.97]That Pichu, Pikachu, they just shrunk Pichu's body and slated his head and added his funny ears.
[22:11.29]That's it.
[22:11.55]Same goddamn Pokémon.
[22:12.13]They're just a young Pikachu.
[22:13.17]Like, come on.
[22:20.91]Her final smash is a ceiling move called Triforce of Wisdom.
[22:29.65]Sonic's final smash, Super Sonic, is more souped up than ever.
[22:33.66]Either you're too slow, or he's lightning fast.
[22:38.38]I liked the other one.
[22:39.28]That seems a little too much.
[22:40.40]Pac-Man also got a speed boost this time around.
[22:43.27]This is like impossible to avoid.
[22:45.64]You can't avoid this.
[22:47.86]They made Final Smashes impossible to avoid.
[22:50.10]You're just too slow for .00.02% frame moves.
[23:04.46]Also, you can play as a female trainer for the first time.
[23:07.41]Don't play with items on?
[23:09.03]Yeah, but... I don't play with all... Spinal smashes are fun.
[23:13.61]...a dramatic slow-mo effect on strong attacks in one-on-one fights.
[23:19.18]No one plays with... Look, I don't usually play with items.
[23:22.00]I understand.
[23:24.46]All items off, only Final Destination, only 1v1.
[23:27.64]Just like before, you can play as Cloud in his Final Fantasy VII costume or his Final Fantasy VII Advent Children costume.
[23:37.91]Why is Cloud in this game?
[23:41.00]I mean, I know that for the longest time, back when I was in college, this was the meme when Super Smash Bros.
[23:48.28]Brawl was gonna come out.
[23:49.80]This was like the obvious joke character that nobody ever thought was gonna come in.
[23:56.07]Cloud's not in any Nintendo game.
[24:02.21]Between the male and female versions, there are eight different villagers.
[24:08.14]Bowser's final smash, Giga Bowser, is even bigger and better.
[24:11.97]He's now as big as Bowser from the Yoshi's Island game.
[24:18.95]Yeah, but Sonic and Mario had this huge rivalry.
[24:22.68]It makes sense.
[24:24.06]The console wars of yesteryear, Sonic vs. Mario, was a major deal.
[24:30.74]There was no Mario vs. Cloud from PlayStation 1, remember that?
[24:36.65]Lon Lon Milk, anyone?
[24:40.48]After 10 long years, Wolf makes his return.
[24:43.45]His design is based on Star Fox Zero, and each of his moves receive a significant upgrade.
[24:54.03]Kirby is his usual puffy self, but we've added a little something to his stone ability.
[25:01.18]He has a copy ability for every fighter, so the more fighters we have, the more challenging he becomes to develop.
[25:11.35]Shulk used to require repeated button presses to toggle Monado art.
[25:15.71]But now you can choose a specific one with a button press and a quick directional button.
[25:19.43]I just want that sword.
[25:21.03]Sure is handy to change arts on the fly.
[25:23.33]What's that sword called?
[25:24.11]Guarantee it's on Etsy right now.
[25:25.16]We also added Fiora to his final smash.
[25:26.76]Somebody has like a $250 version of that sword.
[25:29.60]Like a $400 version of that sword.
[25:31.58]I'm gonna get it.
[25:32.18]It's on Etsy.
[25:32.78]Definitely right now.
[25:33.42]Ganondorf rises again, returning to his popular design from The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
[25:39.25]And for his final smash, he becomes Demon King Gan.
[25:41.85]He's gonna have LEDs and everything too.
[25:44.81]Mii Fighter's proportions have been tweaked a bit.
[25:47.54]There it is.
[25:48.04]There are three types.
[25:49.10]Brawler, Sword Fighter, and Gunner.
[25:53.14]The move set for each type has also been enhanced, and you can now choose from 12 voice options.
[26:00.65]We're hoping to get this fighter ready for online play.
[26:08.09]Previously, its final smash was three sacred treasures.
[26:11.61]This time, he'll be riding in style on the Lightning Chariot.
[26:14.31]$45 for the replica.
[26:16.33]I'm talking about the real one that somebody made.
[26:18.53]In the last game, Zero Suit Samus' final smash called in her gunship.
[26:23.28]This time, she uses her power suit to fire a devastating laser.
[26:30.40]Yeah, why is this a Patch Notes video?
[26:31.72]When Olimar gets damaged, you'll see a crack in his helmet.
[26:36.33]But don't worry, you'll get fixed up right away.
[26:41.72]Bayonetta's costumes from her first two games are both available.
[26:46.44]Listen closely and you'll hear differences in the sound of them.
[26:52.70]It seems we have a guest.
[26:54.22]Who's this?
[26:56.20]Rodan appears as an assist trophy.
[27:00.48]Warrior's Final Smash, Warrior Man, has changed quite a bit.
[27:04.12]After transforming, he no longer uses individual attacks to get the job done.
[27:12.40]Donkey Kong's Final Smash is all rapid fire punches like Donkey Kong Jungle Beat.
[27:19.57]You'll notice that he and other fighters have expressive new facial animations.
[27:26.29]Little Mac's Final Smash is now a rush of blows from Giga Mac.
[27:30.41]In fact, all Final Smash moves in the game get right to the punch.
[27:34.39]Wait, why?
[27:35.11]It should be the big Super Punch that you can just miss.
[27:37.56]You know how many times I've missed that in the actual Punch-Out video game?
[27:40.52]Of course, Jeff still shows up as an assist trophy.
[27:43.50]Are they making Spinal Smashes impossible to miss?
[27:47.00]Likewise, Lucas' Spinal Smash features Kumatora and Boney.
[27:53.44]At first glance, Wii Fit Trainer seems the same, but her face has a new look.
[27:58.72]I wavered a bit on whether to change it, but it was a request from the Wii Fit developers.
[28:04.75]It was the same.
[28:05.55]What?
[28:05.85]I don't understand.
[28:06.73]It was like a mannequin face.
[28:08.65]It was like a slightly different shade of blue.
[28:11.29]What was the difference?
[28:16.43]And for his final smash, say hello to Proto Man and Bass.
[28:20.49]I mean, they aren't in the game, but they're here for a second.
[28:24.49]Palutena's special attacks have been streamlined this time around.
[28:28.76]And her down special is now both a counter and a deflector.
[28:33.14]Really?
[28:35.56]Rob has a new gauge on his chassis showing how much fuel he has left for hovering.
[28:40.40]Go on, Rob.
[28:41.22]Float.
[28:44.54]They really are showing every single character.
[28:46.74]...next to Lucina and Darkpit's numbers.
[28:49.37]Each of these fighters are based on another fighter in the game.
[28:52.17]We're treating these fighters a little differently and have decided to call them Echo Fighters.
[28:56.39]Clone.
[28:58.76]Allow me to introduce a brand new Echo Fighter.
[29:06.72]Oh my god!
[29:07.32]It's Daisy!
[29:09.80]So there's gonna be a... Okay.
[29:10.92]Here's what they're doing.
[29:11.80]I get it.
[29:12.04]I get it.
[29:12.30]Have fun playing as your favorite princesses.
[29:25.41]They're gonna have a hundred playable characters and then forever.
[29:29.01]All in all, if you add up the changes we're making, there could be tens of thousands.
[29:31.19]There's gonna be skins.
[29:32.47]It's just skins.
[29:32.91]Echo fighters, aka skins.
[29:33.75]I hope you're looking forward to some serious matches.
[29:35.47]That's it.
[29:38.04]And here's a new fighter.
[29:39.76]What?
[29:42.66]Oh.
[29:43.24]We already knew that.
[29:45.66]Inkling is a completely new addition to the roster.
[29:48.58]We already knew that.
[29:49.58]They already announced that.
[29:50.20]If you ink opponents, they'll take more damage from attacks.
[29:57.54]Different weapons are available as smash attacks or special attacks.
[30:02.02]The splatter shot.
[30:04.00]Splat bomb.
[30:06.46]Splat roller.
[30:07.14]There really ain't anybody else I could add.
[30:08.98]And the final smash.
[30:10.34]Killer whale.
[30:12.90]Can you guys think of one character that's put in the game that's not there?
[30:15.40]So it's important to refill by pressing the B button while shielding.
[30:19.32]Inkling Boy also debuts alongside Inkling Girl.
[30:23.45]People like to pull out really obscure old Nintendo characters and stuff, and I, you know, everyone does it.
[30:29.73]Well, hold on a minute.
[30:31.09]They might, I think that they might actually go back and... There was a star character with a face?
[30:36.76]He was a star?
[30:37.50]We added in the Squid Sisters as an assist trophy.
[30:40.52]During their live concert, the camera zooms in for a close-up.
[30:43.90]That means it's easier to get knocked off the screen.
[30:52.38]What the hell was that?
[30:55.56]While we're on the topic of assist trophies, let me share some additional information.
[30:59.10]Connor from Detroit become human.
[31:01.58]Get out of here.
[31:05.68]There he is.
[31:06.70]He's not allowed.
[31:07.68]Your beloved fucking character is not allowed on the roster, guys.
[31:13.55]Sorry.
[31:14.41]However, some assist trophies will remain unbeatable.
[31:17.81]Maybe an unexpected guest will photobomb your battle.
[31:21.92]He's so important.
[31:22.72]Yep, it's him.
[31:23.24]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[31:28.97]There's a wide variety.
[31:30.27]More than 50 of them appear in the game.
[31:32.75]Why was Barberman not in the game?
[31:34.99]Barberman should have been a playable character in the game.
[31:37.37]Of course.
[31:37.91]We're also adding even more Pokémon and items.
[31:40.87]We can't wait to show you.
[31:45.47]They made him an assist trophy.
[31:51.21]Well, that's too bad.
[31:56.67]I don't know why I turned this on.
[32:04.34]You look like someone's uncle.
[32:05.48]So?
[32:05.64]You look 60!
[32:06.00]You have a problem with that?
[32:07.48]Uh, see, maybe this is what some of you might not understand.
[32:23.13]I might be a completely different fucking Jerma.
[32:28.03]What you don't realize is the Jerma that you watched two days ago got too excited over Nioh 2's announcement.
[32:36.72]He died.
[32:38.48]He had four heart attacks in a row.
[32:41.48]And I think then they got me.
[32:43.92]I was ready.
[32:44.94]I've been ready for 40 years.
[33:04.14]Why are you wearing his poop dress?
[33:06.82]Because I get all of his clothes.
[33:15.86]Don't worry, I'll be gone in like a few days.
[33:17.22]I don't even like this shit.
[33:20.92]twitch.tv, and apparently I have to stream here more than two or three times a week.
[33:25.96]I don't have time for this shit.
[33:28.68]I work downtown.
[33:31.62]I'll hand it off to somebody else.
[33:34.18]You guys play video games and watch people play video games and livestream themselves?
[33:40.25]It's weird.
[33:40.57]I don't know.
[33:42.85]I'm just going back to my office.
[33:44.49]Factory downtown.
[33:45.57]I kind of don't want to see...
[34:04.38]This monumental patch notes video.
[34:10.70]It can come in handy when recovering from a fall.
[34:12.72]Maybe there's not much else.
[34:15.12]However, if you dodge too much, even on the ground, you'll be wide open to attack and your duration of intangibility gets shorter.
[34:21.76]Alright, so there's diminishing returns on dodges now.
[34:25.80]That's kind of a big deal.
[34:26.60]You can execute short hop attacks by pressing the A button and jump at any time.
[34:33.12]Also, you can smash attack by pressing the A and B buttons, just like the previous game.
[34:39.23]No Animal Crossing?
[34:39.99]What's not even done yet?
[34:40.77]Perfect shield occurs when you release the shield button.
[34:45.47]Until now, you were able to pull it off without any major risks, but going forward, you'll need to time it carefully.
[34:55.34]For one-on-one battles, the damage dealt will now be greater than in battles with higher numbers of players.
[35:00.96]This is a lot of info.
[35:02.41]This should help ensure that the action is well paced.
[35:06.11]Everybody in the E3 audience is watching this on the screen right now.
[35:09.13]It's probably just sitting there like this.
[35:10.89]They're probably just staring like... Better do something or no victory pose for you.
[35:21.64]We've got something special for your playing pleasure in Super Smash Bros.
[35:25.14]Ultimate.
[35:28.96]Hey, did you get that?
[35:29.74]What happened?
[35:31.85]One-on-one damage now is... What's this?
[35:36.60]Nintendo GameCube controls for the new Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
[35:41.04]For many of you, it just isn't the same without them.
[35:44.91]Not to mention, all Super Smash Brothers series Amiibo figures are compatible this time as well.
[35:51.60]In fact, all fighters' current amiibo figures will be supported, even if they're from a different series.
[35:57.27]Tap a compatible amiibo figure to add in a figure player, or FP, and level up.
[36:02.69]Your FP data from previous titles can be transferred.
[36:09.81]And one more thing!
[36:10.91]We hope you're as excited as we are.
[36:13.11]Our staff will continue working hard until the game releases.
[36:16.61]We really appreciate your support.
[36:19.64]We've made including every single fighter ever our number one goal, so I'm kind of hoping you aren't expecting too many new challengers.
[36:26.28]Oh, there it is.
[36:27.02]There's the smashing, crushing defeat.
[36:29.84]However, we do have one more announcement.
[36:31.92]Please, take a look.
[36:33.84]Who is it?
[36:35.00]It's Waluigi.
[36:35.76]No, it's not.
[36:36.08]He was in Assist Trophy.
[36:36.76]It's Bomberman.
[36:37.28]No, it's not.
[36:37.68]He's a... It's the star guy from, like, the... StarTropics.
[36:43.45]Come on.
[36:44.03]Mike from StarTropics.
[36:45.35]Mike from StarTropics.
[36:48.67]We've been waiting for him for a long time.
[36:50.03]Where is Mike from StarTropics?
[36:52.13]Give him to me.
[36:57.87]It better not be Sora.
[37:04.67]It's going to be Ridley.
[37:08.91]It'll be Ridley.
[37:10.14]They'll shrink him down.
[37:23.08]He's fucking huge.
[37:39.26]Oh no, he's not okay.
[37:40.04]I was just gonna say, they're definitely stronger.
[37:51.86]The final smash is he's going to grow huge and get to the left side of the screen.
[38:09.46]Yeah, it's been a long time.
[38:13.64]People have been asking for Ridley for like 20 years.
[38:20.79]Yeah, he's not a Metro villain.
[38:22.99]He's a Metroid villain.
[38:26.85]And the release date.
[38:28.51]What if it's like 2024?
[38:31.23]Oh, wow.
[38:32.13]That's this year.
[38:41.16]I thought my OBS crashed.
[38:43.91]Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Nintendo Treehouse Live from the Los Angeles Convention Center and E3.
[38:50.49]Was he just proving that he could speak Japanese?
[38:53.91]Oh, okay.
[38:54.87]I thought he was just proving that he could speak it.
[39:12.21]I am Bill Trinen.
[39:13.08]I am here with Nate Bildorf and Eric Smith from the Treehouse.
[39:16.78]I'm going to tell you, I went to a wedding one time where they did the whole thing in English and then the whole thing in Spanish.
[39:25.15]It was like a two-hour wedding, like two and a half hours to get through the ceremony.
[39:30.35]We're gonna get every single thing translated here into Japanese.
[39:33.24]It's gonna be great.
[39:34.82]I know that was probably a lot of Smash to digest.
[39:43.86]For those of you viewing at home, Mr. Sakurai on video explained quite a bit to us.
[39:48.46]Okay, wait, wait, hold on a minute.
[39:49.32]I gotta translate that into Japanese.
[39:50.56]He's gonna come up here and watch.
[39:51.33]Mr. Sakurai here with us with his translator, Raymond Illigent.
[39:54.56]This is going to be hard.
[40:08.12]That makes sense.
[40:09.84]I'm really speechless at the fact that we've been working so hard and we're finally able to announce this.
[40:26.80]Yeah, they go across.
[40:27.68]There's like 14 people over to the right of this guy from different countries.
[40:33.72]Next guy's like French.
[40:34.76]Says it in French.
[40:35.52]Then he looks over.
[40:36.24]The next guy says it in like fucking Jerma.
[40:38.38]Next guy says it in like Arabic.
[40:39.99]Next guy says it in like... They just have every language.
[40:43.09]It's just a giant game of telephone.
[40:45.51]They all like look to the left like as every language goes through.
[40:53.96]That would be fucking funny.
[40:57.97]It takes him 30 minutes to get through one sentence and then the conference ends.
[41:02.21]Hey, and welcome to the conference!
[41:05.79]Just want to extend our deepest gratitude and make sure we tell you all about the new Smash game!
[41:10.99]Next guy goes, next guy goes, 40 minutes later they do every language and then they have to stop.
[41:14.60]And, you know, may continue this in the future.
[41:17.90]But I don't know if we'll ever be able to pull this off.
[41:20.28]So I really hope that you'll enjoy this iteration of the game.
[41:24.44]I certainly plan to.
[41:25.16]Oh, yeah.
[41:25.56]There's no Arabic language?
[41:27.22]What?
[41:27.34]What are you talking about?
[41:28.32]There isn't?
[41:28.76]What?
[41:28.93]That isn't language.
[41:29.67]What?
[41:30.35]That isn't language.
[41:48.49]He just grabs the controller out of Sakurai's hand.
[41:51.17]I go first.
[41:51.69]Me first.
[41:52.01]It's my house, dude.
[42:15.74]I built this fucking tree house.
[42:17.14]My house.
[42:19.56]So I'm just going to do an explanation.
[42:21.44]So let's just go to Final Destination.
[42:23.48]And this Final Destination is actually a special version of Final Destination that is going to be slightly different from the version that's in the full game, correct?
[42:31.78]God damn it.
[42:33.70]Just fucked it up.
[42:35.64]I wanted to go like up there with him.
[42:36.92]That's correct.
[42:41.36]That was a bit of a change right there that we changed my title to exclusive first look Like I'm playing it And let me get into Ridley now
[43:00.52]I'm so happy I get to try this for the first fucking time, man.
[43:03.28]I've been such a huge fan of this game.
[43:07.34]Ridley's in the game now.
[43:08.48]Ridley's here.
[43:09.28]Thanks for joining me.
[43:11.06]Let's try that.
[43:11.70]Nice.
[43:11.86]Okay, so you got a fireball.
[43:12.88]That's interesting.
[43:13.66]And comparatively, he's actually very, very tall.
[43:17.53]He's four meters tall.
[43:27.47]And because of that, it was very hard to actually get him into the game in a working condition, but there was a lot of outcry from fans, especially overseas, who decided to put him in.
[43:48.93]In terms of his characteristics, in terms of Smash Bros., he's very much on the cruel side.
[44:07.81]And in Brawl, he made an appearance as a boss and he would do moves like grabbing Samus and just dragging her across the wall.
[44:16.74]And now he drags another fighter.
[44:25.74]These all have commentary.
[44:29.21]It's like two people always playing against each other.
[44:32.69]You can do jumps while he's grabbing onto opponents and do all these other kinds of technical moves.
[44:41.25]And his neutral special is... Get me back on the screen.
[44:44.96]I'm so glad I get to try this.
[44:59.61]Just like the original game, his weak point is actually when he's charging up the fireball in his mouth.
[45:10.49]This is looking awesome, man.
[45:16.54]It's actually crazy that I get to try this for the first time.
[45:18.72]So, is it just like the other ones?
[45:20.46]Like if I press B, do I jump?
[45:29.07]Fuck, hold on a second.
[45:38.92]I can't mute their stream.
[45:42.08]I need their stream.
[45:53.45]They're just talking, I can't mute them.
[45:56.11]Why are they gone?
[45:57.29]Oh wait, I might be able to do this.
[45:59.53]Nah, I can't.
[45:59.95]I can't mute their audio.
[46:04.41]That's too bad.
[46:04.81]That's so... That's too bad.
[46:23.43]Hold on, let me see if I can figure this out.
[46:25.18]I'd have to pull this through a different line, but I don't have any lines set up right now.
[46:29.50]Nope, that didn't work.
[46:50.48]No, I can't mute it because it's coming through my desktop audio.
[46:53.28]The only way I can do this.
[46:54.60]Maybe we could actually play a match and see what it looks like in action.
[46:57.12]How do you guys feel about that?
[47:05.23]No, I can't drop the browser volume because the browser volume just goes through the desktop audio.
[47:09.96]I can't mute it.
[47:10.42]Because I'm pulling the stream from the feed.
[47:13.28]You can mute it by ending.
[47:14.56]Actually, I could probably... No, I can't.
[47:29.52]First, I'd like to start off with what Nate mentioned earlier about having a stage select before you select the fighters.
[47:48.10]Yeah, the volume mixer is OBS.
[47:50.78]Because remember, I'm pulling the feed.
[47:54.24]Here's what I can do.
[47:55.50]I'm dedicated.
[47:57.28]So just enjoy this while I do this.
[47:58.76]I have to do a workaround.
[47:59.70]Just enjoy this fight.
[48:00.40]Very effective.
[48:07.30]And so to add a little bit of strategy, we decided to be able to select the stage beforehand.
[48:14.11]And that way, in a series of matches, the loser gets to pick the stage.
[48:20.10]And I think you might have seen the score display there.
[48:28.21]And then for one-on-one battles, we decided to display the score like that.
[48:38.12]And obviously, you lose when you reach zero.
[48:40.96]Don't do this.
[48:45.06]Good triumphs.
[48:46.90]Nate has no mercy, does he?
[48:47.86]Never.
[48:48.12]Especially against a new fighter.
[48:50.20]Alright, I got it.
[48:50.72]Give me one minute.
[49:06.61]Oh!
[49:07.47]There we go.
[49:08.75]Oh, come on, man.
[49:10.73]That should be illegal.
[49:11.57]And of course, this game is still in development, so the damage ratio, where the speed spot is, things like that may change in the future.
[49:33.25]And as I mentioned in the video earlier, there is this one-on-one damage where you take on more damage, and that's been implemented here.
[49:52.15]And as we speak, we're at a tie right now.
[49:57.77]This is a new item we see on screen here.
[50:00.24]This new item is called Black Hole.
[50:01.82]That's not yours.
[50:02.46]Basically, what happens is it attracts all the fighters into the center of that black hole.
[50:17.38]And I was talking about assist trophies, and it usually only gets points in time matches, but as we're speaking, we've got a finals match.
[50:36.03]And you can see Samus' ship crashing in the background.
[50:40.15]We got a review for that animation.
[50:42.11]And it looks like we've added some new technology to the game as well.
[50:45.55]I'm ready.
[50:45.91]Oh.
[51:02.59]Yeah, let's start right from the previous title.
[51:08.12]I had to open this in Firefox.
[51:11.14]So yeah, the damage ratio was low and that's why we were able to get out of Mos Galaga.
[51:17.32]One more second.
[51:18.34]Let's just stick this up in the air real quick.
[51:21.28]Oh, come over here.
[51:21.94]Come over here.
[51:28.21]That was bad.
[51:28.89]And we actually added a new spec to the Warp Star.
[51:31.25]So holding up, you can actually delay when the Warp Star falls.
[51:34.35]Just one viewer.
[51:34.97]I'm burning now.
[51:35.43]OK.
[51:35.61]Here we go.
[51:36.09]God damn it.
[51:36.70]Right when the fucking game ends.
[51:59.77]I'll get it next time.
[52:01.79]Check this out.
[52:02.51]I got it.
[52:03.25]Play one more game.
[52:03.95]Play one more.
[52:04.91]One more.
[52:05.13]So I can make this fucking stupid joke.
[52:08.19]I'm ready.
[52:08.51]Do a really long one too.
[52:10.29]So I get an opportunity.
[52:31.88]So, Mr. Sakurai, would you like to play one?
[52:34.74]Here we go, here we go.
[52:36.10]Alright, let's do it.
[52:38.50]Let's do a four-player match.
[52:40.18]What do you guys say?
[52:40.92]Sounds good.
[52:41.64]I'm ready.
[52:42.18]Center one.
[52:42.54]Here you go.
[53:00.72]okay so which what stage should I play on I'm gonna I'm gonna try this one this one looks good who should I play as though I'm gonna say I should play as this is this is online too so interesting
[53:24.27]Mega Man.
[53:24.75]He's going to play Mega Man.
[53:25.65]I'm going to play as Ganondorf, I think.
[53:28.13]He's my favorite from the Zelda series.
[53:32.27]That's my new screen name that I go by.
[53:34.28]N8.
[53:34.50]It's kind of like saying mate.
[53:36.98]You go like, oh, good night.
[53:39.42]Alright, let's try it.
[53:40.12]I'm looking forward to this.
[53:46.61]I'm ready.
[53:57.57]Watch out for the, uh... Mega Man's an annoying character to play against, seriously.
[54:07.00]Is he in the same moveset, or is it different?
[54:09.52]Oh, Nintendog!
[54:10.86]Gotta get the Nintendog outta here!
[54:12.84]Get outta here, you stupid Nintendog!
[54:15.36]I'm the first guy on Twitch to get this!
[54:16.97]I gotta make sure I get like a thousand more viewers!
[54:20.47]Did I fall down?
[54:20.97]No, I'm still there.
[54:25.60]I gotta make sure it looks good.
[54:28.34]Gotta grab him.
[54:30.72]Ah, the whole stage comes down.
[54:32.38]That's fucking crazy.
[54:36.90]Shit.
[54:39.68]No, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.
[54:40.56]I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.
[54:41.54]Fuck!
[54:41.76]I'm the first guy on Twitch to get it.
[54:46.50]I gotta make sure I show it good.
[54:49.40]Watch out for the final smash.
[54:58.10]It's hard with four people on the screen, seriously.
[55:01.81]You get the sword, the sword's back.
[55:05.43]Watch out for the fire thing down there.
[55:08.95]Don't grab the... Is the grab less than it was before?
[55:12.35]Or what?
[55:20.06]The audio seems to be getting a little weird, but...
[55:28.97]Oh, my game crashed!
[55:41.80]I think my game fucked up.
[55:43.48]Oh, who are these people?
[55:58.38]It's just some audio bugs.
[56:00.34]This is just a video bug and an audio bug.
[56:03.07]Let me fix the video and audio bug here.
[56:06.79]There we go.
[56:09.45]That makes sense.
[56:11.09]It fell down.
[56:18.41]So the forward B is now a dash?
[56:21.37]Is that what I'm understanding?
[56:29.44]Alright, I can't.
[56:30.68]I'm playing in... There you go.
[56:39.33]There's your joke.
[56:47.77]Oh, you can't even hear it.
[56:48.41]Let me pull this audio back up so we can actually watch the conference.
[56:55.63]Fake?
[56:58.15]Come on, man.
[56:58.55]You gotta get...
[56:59.70]You know how hard it is to get viewers these days?
[57:01.58]I didn't try anything.
[57:11.43]This is the guy that played Smash Brothers first on Twitch.
[57:16.98]Lost 100 viewers and then gained back 200.
[57:19.22]Now you can hear it though.
[57:34.27]So it's kind of just Smash Brothers, huh?
[57:36.61]He burped.
[57:37.77]Here comes a sub.
[57:40.45]Oh, thanks, man.
[57:41.69]Is this the guy that burped on stream?
[57:44.37]Yes, it is.
[57:44.98]Welcome.
[57:45.24]Welcome to the stream.
[58:03.25]Yeah, it really is just Smash 4 with balance changes.
[58:06.73]I mean, the whole thing with having 100 characters in the game, essentially.
[58:17.82]Like, what?
[58:18.34]60, 70 characters are going to be in this game.
[58:24.73]At some point, it just becomes the Marvel vs. Capcom.
[58:27.99]Right?
[58:28.59]Like, this is going to have the same amount of... How many characters did Marvel vs. Capcom 2 have?
[58:40.22]There were, like, at least 40 or 50 characters in that game.
[58:42.72]Maybe 60 or something.
[58:51.64]So is it 80?
[58:53.56]So think of it like that.
[58:55.76]So is this it?
[59:00.17]That's it.
[59:01.17]They're just going to play... They're going to have like a gameplay smash commentary now with the creator.
[59:08.97]Is there anything else that they're doing?
[59:09.97]Is this the entire conference?
[59:11.55]Is that it?
[59:12.47]I guess it is, right?
[59:13.57]Has to be.
[59:19.95]wow that was fun yeah that was yeah I almost want to play again yes I mean I'm gonna play it I'm gonna want to play it I need to cool down
[59:39.29]You know, it's the type of game where you kind of smash the conference, want to play and have fun.
[59:44.65]So we've we've obviously talked about Ridley.
[59:48.57]We also lost a hundred since I stopped the joke about how this game is going to use all of the previous amiibo.
[59:55.24]Was Sony's any good?
[59:55.92]Um... Sony's was okay.
[59:56.34]There was a few interesting things.
[59:57.34]Death Stranding, but nobody even knows what Death Stranding even is.
[60:25.77]We keep getting these weird cryptic trailers and gameplay moments.
[60:31.86]Does anybody even know how that game plays?
[60:34.44]Nobody does.
[60:36.50]For all you know, that could be a puzzle game.
[60:41.96]Nobody knows what the hell it is.
[60:46.71]And we also have a new Inkling amiibo for the Smash Bros.
[60:50.57]series.
[60:51.37]You're a delivery guy.
[60:52.39]Yeah, but nobody knows even what it is.
[60:54.13]I think this is the first time I've seen a 3D realization of... It's being an Amazon Prime delivery person.
[61:02.17]I mean, obviously I've seen it during production and development, but...
[61:05.83]Well, we got Ridley.
[61:06.48]A little nerdy?
[61:06.98]Dude, you're at a video game conference.
[61:17.96]You can share whatever you want.
[61:19.24]That's nerdy.
[61:22.40]He says the thing, and all of a sudden, like, a bunch of jocks in the audience.
[61:25.22]It's an audience full of jocks, and they're all, like, in tank tops, and they're all like, fucking, boo, this sucks.
[61:30.39]How could you say that?
[61:31.83]They're all, like, lifting weights in there, in the fucking audience.
[61:34.47]There's, like, 50 benches, and they're all, like, benching their body weight.
[61:42.92]You're going to be fine, man.
[61:45.12]Say whatever you want.
[61:45.68]And that denotes how much ink you use up when you use the splat bomb.
[61:48.60]But the amount of ink you use in Splatoon and Smash is different.
[61:51.00]In Smash, you can use a lot more splat bombs, so the spec is a little different.
[62:09.25]Details, man.
[62:10.05]Details.
[62:12.81]We don't have a figure to show today.
[62:14.99]We did also introduce Daisy as an Echo Fighter in the game.
[62:18.91]They got that in the museum case.
[62:20.71]There will also be Daisy Amiibo in the Smash Brothers series.
[62:23.93]It's like break in case of fire.
[62:25.99]Might as well put that underneath that.
[62:30.22]Just in case the building catches fire, smash this and put it out with the Wrigley figurine.
[62:35.00]Yes.
[62:40.92]This is here for a nerd emergency, you know what I mean?
[62:48.20]They all laugh.
[62:54.50]The guy starts getting his ass kicked.
[62:56.71]Sakurai's like destroying him and he's got one stock left.
[62:59.27]He turns around and like elbow smashes into it and grabs the Ridley amiibo and puts it down.
[63:03.61]There we go.
[63:06.12]It was an emergency!
[63:07.78]Ridley comes on stage with an assist trophy and he wins the game.
[63:10.53]So, is FromSoftware's new game that Samurai game?
[63:12.35]Yes.
[63:12.81]Well, they have a couple, actually.
[63:14.13]They have this really strange PSVR game that's coming out.
[63:30.41]where it didn't really show or do anything.
[63:32.89]It was just, look at this house.
[63:34.97]This house has rooms.
[63:36.69]There's a girl in this house.
[63:37.69]That's it.
[63:39.69]Nobody has any idea what that is.
[63:41.22]But there's that, and then there's that Activision collaboration they have with the samurai sword fighting, horseback riding.
[63:49.14]That game looked crazy with the hookshot.
[63:54.10]Just kind of scared that Activision is involved.
[63:56.18]I don't know what the fuck they were doing that for.
[64:00.90]Spider-Man was probably the only thing... Yeah, that's true.
[64:03.40]The only thing that really grabbed my attention in the Sony conference was Spider-Man.
[64:06.73]Alright, do I need to keep streaming this?
[64:08.15]I don't think I do.
[64:16.22]I have a doctor's appointment in, like, an hour.
[64:19.58]I have to, like, get out of here.
[64:21.60]When is my doctor's?
[64:22.30]Yeah, I'm good.
[64:23.08]I'm good.
[64:27.04]I have a follow-up doctor's appointment in, like... Yeah, like 3 o'clock, so I gotta go soon.
[64:31.06]E3 is more important.
[64:32.00]Alright, well, I'm gonna turn this, like, off, and you're just gonna get me for a minute.
[64:45.98]This is what you came for.
[64:46.90]You came for this.
[64:47.86]I don't need to do that.
[64:52.09]Like, I can very clearly just be here while we listen to this lightly in the background.
[64:56.51]Okay, that's better.
[65:00.13]Like, you can barely hear them.
[65:01.17]You can just hear me.
[65:02.96]So, this is it.
[65:04.38]Well, that was fun.
[65:06.92]That was the...
[65:08.97]That was the Nintendo Direct E3 Conference.
[65:12.14]If you like the things that I had to say, and if you like hanging out with me, then go ahead and hit that follow button, you know what I mean?
[65:18.32]And yeah, I am one of those streamers that streams in a fucking bathrobe.
[65:21.44]I just ran down here from the shower, so... Do I have $40 pomade in my hair?
[65:28.29]No, it's called shower water.
[65:30.07]I got hard water here, so that's why.
[65:35.78]Do you drink scotch?
[65:36.48]Do I drink?
[65:36.90]No, I don't drink scotch in this role, but I was sweating here.
[65:40.14]No.
[65:43.94]That's it, I guess.
[65:46.90]I would say of all the... Okay, let's rate the conferences.
[65:49.36]Okay?
[65:49.81]I watched them all.
[65:59.45]I can't rate... I don't know how to rate these conferences.
[66:13.52]They were all bad.
[66:14.58]All of them.
[66:17.72]Spider-Man is cool.
[66:20.34]That's it.
[66:21.24]Alright, see you later.
[66:31.27]I think... The only things that are... Maybe I'm just... I'm getting fucking old, guys.
[66:36.19]I'm getting old.
[66:37.96]Everything that I saw, all the stuff, all the games that were being played, all the people that were talking on stage.
[66:44.09]I don't like, I don't give a shit.
[66:46.73]Is that weird that I just don't give a shit at all?
[66:52.75]The Resident Evil 2 remake is awesome.
[66:55.23]That's awesome.
[66:55.85]If it plays like Resident Evil 4 or Resident Evil 5, it's going to be great.
[67:01.03]I think I'm just getting old.
[67:04.63]Dude, I used to stay up.
[67:06.82]Talking about Smash Brothers here.
[67:07.92]I used to stay up until 3 o'clock in the morning every single Friday.
[67:14.41]I was in school, and I couldn't do that.
[67:17.27]You can't stay up till 3 a.m.
[67:19.01]when you have to go to school the next day.
[67:20.19]At least I couldn't.
[67:21.06]It was a disaster for me.
[67:22.80]But Sakurai used to tease every Friday at 3 a.m.,
[67:28.20]Well, that would mean that Saturday, well, I had a lot of Saturday detentions.
[67:32.07]I was a bad kid.
[67:33.19]And this is college.
[67:33.89]So, by the way, none of this is even real.
[67:35.19]It's Friday into Saturday.
[67:37.47]There would be no school.
[67:38.69]So there's no school on Saturday.
[67:40.05]But the point still remains.
[67:41.05]I was groggy the next day.
[67:43.64]But I was in school.
[67:44.56]I was in college.
[67:46.04]And he would tease at 3 a.m.
[67:48.10]this new thing, this new, oh, we might even announce a new fucking item.
[67:53.99]He did it for like 30 weeks in a row.
[67:56.19]And I was so excited for it.
[67:58.15]I told all my friends in college that if certain characters got announced, if they didn't, and I would shit in a diaper and stuff, and we would like sit up and stay up late at night to discuss.
[68:08.35]We'd have like four hour long discussions about who's going to and who's not going to be in this game and what are their movesets going to be.
[68:17.61]I'm just sitting in the bathroom watching like the greatest Smash Brothers game in history.
[68:22.91]And all I can think about is, did I eat any tomatoes last night?
[68:31.47]And am I going to have any oranges today because I need to get my vitamin count up?
[68:36.00]Did I have any, like, what did I eat last night?
[68:37.86]What did I take in for nutrients?
[68:42.00]Or my car needs to be serviced.
[68:47.32]Should I do that now?
[68:48.06]Or should I do that in a couple days?
[68:59.81]I don't care about Sonic the Hedgehog anymore.
[69:05.39]I'm hitting this epiphany right now.
[69:08.62]Everything in E3 has been like...
[69:15.58]Like, somebody needs to wow me.
[69:18.60]This is what happens when you do too many drugs.
[69:21.38]This sucks.
[69:21.94]Don't do drugs ever.
[69:24.81]Because if you do too many drugs, then no drug will ever get you there ever again.
[69:29.61]And then you start doing crazy shit to try to get there.
[69:40.99]The greatest Smash Brothers game in history.
[69:42.89]That's not hard enough.
[69:44.63]I need more.
[69:47.79]Don't do drugs.
[69:49.04]Don't ever play a video game in your life.
[69:51.46]Just stick to raking leaves.
[69:53.20]You know what I mean?
[69:54.86]Just stick to raking leaves.
[69:56.16]You'll be fine.
[69:57.26]Don't have to do any of this stuff.
[69:58.66]The drugs won't be enough in five to ten years.
[70:01.11]I guarantee it.
[70:13.36]And that's been the treehouse now.
[70:17.08]Battletoads looked fucking cool for the... Okay, here we go.
[70:21.12]Spider-Man for PlayStation, Cuphead DLC, and the new Battletoads.
[70:26.31]So I guess you could say just by me saying that, and I don't want to say this out loud because somebody will scream in my face.
[70:32.63]The Microsoft conference, just based on the games that I'm the old man fucking leaf raker that is excited for.
[70:41.02]Was the random indie games that the Microsoft conference showed.
[70:48.43]Now, Bethesda did show the most interesting stuff.
[70:53.59]Bethesda probably had the best stuff to show.
[70:57.37]But they didn't show a logo of Battletoads.
[70:59.12]They didn't show text on the screen of Battletoads.
[71:02.10]I mean, fuck, man.
[71:08.11]bethesda was probably the best show in quotes but whatever I think that um Microsoft's gonna tank the whole company's gone the whole company's tanking but it is what it is objectively wrong
[71:35.75]I don't really care about Nioh 2.
[71:38.17]I didn't really like Nioh 1.
[71:39.47]I got shit-faced and played it on stream and I didn't like it.
[71:45.82]Dreams is the only other thing I'm really excited for.
[71:48.26]And they didn't really even care to talk that much about that.
[71:52.74]They brought the two people from Media Molecule on and said, Dreams is coming.
[71:57.17]Cool.
[71:57.79]Yeah, it's kind of cool.
[71:59.07]See ya.
[72:05.48]So there you go.
[72:06.00]Here's my top... I'll give it to you.
[72:07.76]I'll put the camera on so you can see me.
[72:10.46]I seriously need... I don't have one of those rope things that ties it together.
[72:13.44]I don't.
[72:13.68]I got rid of it.
[72:14.08]I don't like it.
[72:14.51]It irritates my skin.
[72:15.61]Because it like cinches here and I don't like it.
[72:20.43]Dreams, Spider-Man, Battletoads, Cuphead DLC, and Cyberpunk.
[72:24.55]There you go.
[72:25.87]Best in show.
[72:27.53]It only gives it what I actually even remotely care about.
[72:37.22]And you could say Metro, but I have to play Metro Last Light to get excited for the next one.
[72:49.77]The FromSoftware game?
[72:51.21]I don't even... I don't know anything about it.
[72:54.47]I'm just naming things that I know I'm going to enjoy.
[72:57.01]There were a lot of fucking interesting things.
[73:05.58]I'm just old and stupid.
[73:06.78]That's what happens.
[73:08.12]When you get a little bit older, your brain just starts... You see?
[73:11.06]I told you.
[73:13.96]Sea of Thieves, I would rather... I would rather chew up coffee grounds than pretend to be excited about the Sea of Thieves DLC.
[73:26.17]I would rather... You know, I would rather get bit by a homeless guy.
[73:34.00]Not that hard.
[73:34.52]You know, you walk by him and like you're with your friends and you're like pointing over there to show them like a tourist attraction.
[73:40.46]Oh, yeah.
[73:41.06]See, the Great Wall of China is this way, like 4,000 miles that way.
[73:45.46]But way before that, you can see the Capitol building right here.
[73:49.33]And then he like bites your fucking hand like, ah, shit, dude.
[73:54.17]And like he leaves like one of those like cat bite marks, like not like very much.
[73:58.43]It's, you know, we don't bleed at all.
[74:00.65]I'd rather just deal with that than care about Sea of Thieves.
[74:04.54]Where are we going?
[74:04.94]What happened?
[74:05.50]Oh.
[74:09.76]That's how you get infected?
[74:11.12]Whatever.
[74:11.54]This is cures.
[74:15.46]I was kind of excited for Sea of Thieves last year.
[74:17.24]Yeah, but that's before they just made it.
[74:19.48]The E3 demonstration last year is what the game turned out to be this year.
[74:24.08]The teaser?
[74:25.99]Look at this.
[74:27.33]That's the whole game, by the way.
[74:28.83]That's the entire game.
[74:29.67]There's nothing else there.
[74:30.31]I thought it was going to be like an expanded, giant, big...
[74:33.29]game with a ton of shit to do.
[74:34.87]It's just kind of a multiplayer game where you run around a ship and... It's just Agario with ships.
[74:48.90]But with that...
[74:51.35]Fucking Hitman 2 is coming out too.
[74:52.71]I'm just wrong.
[74:53.51]I'm just incorrect.
[74:54.59]Don't listen to any of us.
[74:55.99]Any of these streamers and YouTubers that you listen to, don't listen to a goddamn thing we say.
[75:00.30]Hitman 2 is going to be fucking awesome.
[75:01.74]It's going to be awesome because Hitman 1 was my favorite game of two years ago.
[75:04.38]It was my game of the year.
[75:05.80]It's going to be great.
[75:07.30]Don't listen to anybody.
[75:09.52]As Stone Cold Steve Austin once said in his book, don't trust anybody.
[75:15.74]Especially me.
[75:16.74]That's what he said.
[75:24.15]When's Hat coming out?
[75:25.05]What do you mean, Hat?
[75:33.12]I'm not going to play the new Don't Starve.
[75:34.44]I didn't really play the old one, so I don't know why I played the old one.
[75:40.96]Not into Anthem, really.
[75:45.71]But do I trust you about that?
[75:47.17]Yeah, just take everything with a grain of salt.
[75:49.51]You never know.
[75:50.83]You never know what some fucking psycho has to say about it.
[75:54.45]I'm not saying we're all psychos, but I mean, that's for you to decide, not for me.
[76:04.25]But I got a doctor's appointment to go to.
[76:05.61]Let me see what's going on here.
[76:11.28]This is kind of the story.
[76:12.70]I really thought this was going to be a little longer and we'd have more time to do it.
[76:14.98]I thought there was going to be more here.
[76:17.06]Is there anything else going on right now?
[76:18.75]Or is it just, that's it?
[76:26.51]No, that's it.
[76:28.13]That's not.
[76:28.89]I'm going to be at the doctor.
[76:30.59]Alright.
[76:30.87]Well, so here's the deal.
[76:33.13]When I get back from the doctor, I might just come back and stream again tonight after the doctor.
[76:42.00]Later.
[76:43.00]And if for some reason that I don't, then I don't know why I wouldn't.
[76:46.40]But maybe for some reason, what if I get like stuck in traffic on the way back from the doctor?
[76:51.17]I might get in four hour traffic.
[76:52.33]So I'll stream on Thursday if I don't stream tonight.
[76:57.81]We'll see.
[76:59.15]Stay tuned.
[77:02.34]People were giving bits and shit too, weren't they?
[77:05.02]Hold on.
[77:08.40]I didn't have an intro or an outro.
[77:09.96]Let's make this quick.
[77:13.20]Thanks for coming out to the Nintendo conference.
[77:15.87]No, I am not.
[77:17.73]Before I go, before we do this, I am not excited at all, at all, about Kingdom Hearts 3.
[77:24.33]At all.
[77:25.72]They showed those trailers were awful.
[77:29.00]They were terrible.
[77:30.37]And I don't know what, something about them seemed very rushed and thrown together.
[77:38.38]It just didn't look very good.
[77:39.48]It just looked like there was a lot of frame rate issues.
[77:43.52]It sounded like a fucking fan dub with no audio.
[77:46.64]It was just like, what the hell is going on here?
[77:49.50]The production quality was like really, really bad.
[77:51.88]And that doesn't mean it's going to be a bad game.
[77:53.78]That just means that what they were showing was weird.
[77:58.91]It just felt off for some reason.
[78:07.59]The Disney contract's gonna come to an end.
[78:09.07]I mean, the Pirates of the Caribbean world look cool.
[78:12.32]I mean, obviously Frozen's gonna sell millions of copies like we already talked about.
[78:18.30]But somebody, like, fucked up that video.
[78:21.18]Because it was not good.
[78:28.92]Some random intern made the trailers.
[78:30.60]Be nice.
[78:32.38]For an E3 conference where you're showing this stuff for the first time, come on.
[78:36.33]You can't get that wrong.
[78:41.80]Felt really rushed, it did.
[78:46.52]But.
[78:47.85]With that, that was probably my biggest disappointment of the whole show.
[78:51.87]Because I played through the first one, played through the second one.
[78:54.44]Obviously been waiting 60 years in dog years to be able to play that game.
[79:01.85]Kingdom Hearts 3 has been a thing for so long and I was super underwhelmed by those trailers.
[79:12.13]Anywho, I will be back probably in four or five hours or not.
[79:17.88]And if I'm not, then I'll just stream on... Instead of Friday, we'll stream on Thursday.
[79:22.08]I want to start... I'm getting the Dark Souls itch.
[79:24.68]I want to play Dark Souls Remastered.
[79:27.06]Not yet, though.
[79:33.59]But let me get this out.
[79:34.39]Thanks for coming out, everybody.
[79:36.81]To this little baby stream.
[79:40.66]And let's do the credits.
[79:41.68]I'm not sure they even were many, but maybe they were.
[79:46.20]I'm not even logged into Streamlabs yet.
[79:53.56]And as always, take everything I say with a grain of salt, because I'm just some fucking guy.
[79:56.66]You know, a lot of people want you to listen to their opinion on things.
[80:03.38]You gotta listen to me.
[80:05.64]Listen to everything I say, and if you don't agree with me, you're stupid and wrong.
[80:10.00]No, I'm just a guy.
[80:12.86]Just like you.
[80:14.92]Or girl.
[80:16.22]Just like you.
[80:24.17]Alright, so we got like a little couple of... Let's see the subs today.
[80:27.45]It's gonna be really slow.
[80:29.95]This is gonna go so slow because there probably was only like a few subs.
[80:39.06]Thank you for subbing during this Nintendo conference.
[80:43.78]Thank you, DedoDedo.

[81:54.02]Topramin.
[81:55.18]Topramin.
[81:56.53]AndyGSW.
[81:58.27]Antonic.
[81:58.69]Why?
[81:58.93]There's a lot of people.
[81:59.83]I didn't expect this many people.
[82:01.71]FidoFitter.
[82:02.57]CornOnTheRob.
[82:04.01]PriceyBabe.
[82:04.69]ReliablyLazy.

[82:33.20]Thank you guys.
[82:35.32]For only streaming for like an hour and a half.
[82:37.92]That's a lot of people to subscribe.
[82:39.41]Thank you.
[82:43.85]And the bits.
[82:44.31]We're going to get through them very, very, very quickly.
[82:46.67]Because there's not very many of them.
[82:52.05]Let's give a special thank you to StixRenegade for the $1.
[82:55.76]PokeCharizard for Smash Please.
[82:57.90]Got confirmed.
[82:58.48]You can play as him for as long as you want.
[83:00.94]SirFeline, thanks for the $3 in a row here.
[83:04.55]My favorite character from the best game, Wii Fit, is back.
[83:07.97]Is it the Nintendo conference or the Smash conference?
[83:09.89]And where is Solaire in this game?
[83:14.69]I don't even... What's Solaire?
[83:16.31]Solaire?
[83:16.75]I don't know what that is.
[83:22.43]Chair is for Jerma.
[83:23.64]Chair is popular.
[83:24.36]What do you mean, chair?
[83:27.52]Thank you, Snooze, for the $1.
[83:29.10]Big ol' butt cowboy.
[83:31.02]What is this?
[83:37.34]I'm not saying all this.
[83:39.90]Thank you, Snooze, for the dollar.
[83:42.27]I'm not going to say the next two words there.
[83:45.51]You got me in a... I ain't doing a problem speech.
[83:49.65]That's what I like to call these.
[83:50.61]These are problem speech.
[83:52.93]Sometimes people like to catch you in a problem speech.
[83:55.04]Ain't going to happen.
[83:58.84]Thank you for the dollar, Snooze.
[83:59.74]I appreciate it.
[84:04.21]Thank you.
[84:05.95]It was an honor.
[84:13.62]I'm glad that I gained and lost 100 viewers instantly, and those people will never come back.
[84:18.92]Because they think I'm a... awful person for doing what I just did.
[84:23.98]They didn't think it was a joke.
[84:25.02]They thought I, like, stole it.
[84:27.34]I wonder what would happen if my title was actually, I stole this game from the E3 booth.
[84:34.02]And I did that.
[84:35.40]And how long would it be there for?
[84:39.93]Thank you Grantman for the $1.
[84:41.55]Thanks, Grant.
[84:43.29]Stream your doctor's appointment.
[84:45.31]That's a breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.
[84:47.49]I'm not going to do that.
[84:50.85]Thank you HalfMoney for the $1.
[84:53.71]CommandRabbit for the $2.
[84:56.07]Cloud has no reason to be in Smash.
[85:00.04]I mean, besides the fact that it was demanded by millions of people...
[85:04.78]But technically speaking, I don't know why he's there.
[85:08.24]But whatever.
[85:09.04]It's not me to decide.
[85:11.80]Thank you, Frexter, for the two bucks.
[85:15.18]That's it.
[85:15.52]No message.
[85:16.02]Thank you.
[85:17.57]And with that, I potentially will see you guys in a few hours.
[85:20.59]And if not, then I'll see you Thursday.
[85:23.11]For sure.
[85:24.27]And we're either going to keep doing Destroy All Humans or we're going to start Dark Souls Remastered.
[85:31.47]I think I'm going to continue to play Destroy All Humans, because why wouldn't I?
[85:38.25]And I'll see you soon.
[85:40.13]Thanks for watching.
[85:40.73]Take care, guys.
[85:42.49]See you later.
