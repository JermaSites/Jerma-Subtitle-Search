[01:10.52]Is the email joke old yet?
[01:12.26]Have we decided that?
[01:13.30]Is the email part of this title thing a joke?
[01:16.26]Is it old?
[01:17.72]Or am I going to just keep having different forwarded emails and replying emails?
[01:23.02]I'm not so sure.
[01:23.60]I don't know.
[01:26.79]I don't know my Twitter password, so I can't get into my Twitter and tweet about this.
[01:32.01]Just tweet about this.
[01:33.89]Tell your friends that I'm streaming, because I don't even know how to communicate with any of your friends.
[01:36.77]You know what I mean?
[01:42.71]CC me.
[01:43.35]Ah, shit, you're right.
[01:44.38]I gotta, like, CC.
[01:48.78]Is FWD... Is it FW or FWD?
[01:52.50]Is that before or after?
[01:53.46]Alright, re-re-forward.
[02:01.08]We'll do re-forward.
[02:09.48]Like that, right?
[02:15.64]It's going to be forward re.
[02:16.76]Okay.
[02:21.72]Oh, lowercase?
[02:22.90]I haven't been sent an email in like four years.
[02:33.81]CC me on that one.
[02:38.53]There we go.
[02:39.35]Forward re, like reply, Red Dead.
[02:42.98]This is like a very important company email.
[02:49.80]Anyways, hi guys.
[02:51.18]Hope you're having a good Thursday.
[02:52.40]Hope you're enjoying yourselves.
[02:56.22]I, um... Okay.
[02:59.54]I'm a little on the weird side today.
[03:00.76]I got like a migraine.
[03:02.93]You know, that's pretty typical.
[03:04.23]I'm like Mr. Migraine.
[03:07.99]And I went to the coffee place and I didn't get a straw.
[03:10.87]So I literally just popped open the top.
[03:12.67]I'm gonna drink this like a fucking soda can.
[03:19.64]Alright.
[03:21.38]So, we're gonna continue Red Dead.
[03:23.32]We're gonna continue Red Dead tonight.
[03:24.64]Uh, I don't think we're gonna play this tomorrow.
[03:28.79]I wanna do a, like, big Friday night shitshow with, um, PSVR.
[03:34.27]So, wanna finish this... I mean, we might finish the game, like, in the next couple of streams that I stream this game.
[03:40.53]But we're gonna do an extra stream, uh, Saturday or Sunday.
[03:44.46]You'll see another Red Dead stream.
[03:47.38]Just get it on the screen and get this fucking intro off.
[03:52.61]And here we are.
[03:55.61]I think my chat is broken.
[03:57.61]That's not surprising.
[04:01.10]Not surprising at all.
[04:03.18]That should be good to go.
[04:04.04]That should be good to go as well.
[04:06.44]And let's reload my chat because it doesn't exist anymore.
[04:15.04]Well, there we are.
[04:16.16]Hey.
[04:17.22]Pop it out.
[04:19.67]Move this one away.
[04:23.03]So we're about to go to Mexico.
[04:25.79]We are about to go to Mexico.
[04:27.79]I don't know much about this at all, what that means.
[04:30.75]All I know is people told me, dude, you're in for a treat.
[04:33.32]I'm like, okay.
[04:33.72]It's like, alright.
[04:36.64]Calm down.
[04:40.44]I can't make a tweet about this and that angers me.
[04:44.11]We're not going to do an angry stream today.
[04:46.07]Last stream, let me just, like, throw this out there.
[04:49.05]We'll wait for more people to come.
[04:50.57]I'm going to apologize.
[04:52.71]We're going to do an apology stream.
[04:56.02]And by an apology stream, I mean I'm going to plead my case.
[05:02.16]Where the hell are we?
[05:05.14]And somebody didn't fucking stop that fire out correctly.
[05:08.14]They didn't put, like, extra lighter fluid on that.
[05:11.36]Alright, where are we going?
[05:13.36]I...
[05:15.56]let's see so those of you that have played this game do we am I going to lose access to all this if I go to Mexico or can I just travel back and forth and it doesn't matter apology not accepted like if we so I I'll still be able to do it no you're good okay that's cool okay well let's
[05:49.49]My thoughts on the Hearthstone expansion.
[05:51.25]Well... I mean, opening packs is kind of fun, but I don't really play Hearthstone.
[06:00.26]There are unlockables as you progress.
[06:01.84]Okay, that's cool.
[06:08.12]Let's just go to McFarland.
[06:09.35]I feel like that's the best place to go.
[06:19.67]Hearthstone's cool.
[06:23.69]I really, really was into Hearthstone when it was in beta.
[06:27.18]In like the first year it was out or so.
[06:30.42]But for some reason, I don't know, it's one of those games that requires like... You constantly have to keep up with it, and you constantly have to play it.
[06:39.26]I'm not a big fan of games that you have to constantly, consistently play to be able to play them.
[06:46.12]There's a lot of games that are like that.
[06:47.64]Where, like, new things come out, and new cards come out.
[06:50.46]You have to constantly be on top of it, otherwise you're just gonna get stomped.
[06:54.03]And you can just play, like, tavern brawl and shit like that.
[06:56.47]That's fun.
[06:59.41]But...
[07:00.85]You have to be on top of it.
[07:02.21]If you don't have the new cards, then good luck.
[07:05.11]You know what really angered me about Hearthstone?
[07:07.57]Is... There was a deck.
[07:09.41]I think it was Control Warrior.
[07:11.99]Where you had to have like seven legendaries.
[07:14.42]There was like seven or like eight specific legendaries you had to have.
[07:18.50]Or you couldn't play the deck.
[07:19.98]And it was like THE deck to play.
[07:22.26]It was like the best deck.
[07:24.16]I remember just being like, I don't have Grom Hellscream.
[07:27.48]I can't play Hearthstone.
[07:30.32]Alright, look, I'm trying to figure out a way to get around this.
[07:32.46]I'm gonna have to go down.
[07:33.76]Yeah, that's what it was, Wallet Warrior.
[07:39.89]You didn't have Grom Hellscream and Sylvanas or something.
[07:46.09]Yeah, you couldn't play it.
[07:48.51]No, I'm not jumping off.
[07:49.35]This is not a joke stream yet.
[07:50.82]We've got plenty of time for jokes.
[07:52.36]This is gonna be a fucking 6800 hour stream in a row.
[07:57.54]And I'm gonna sit here the whole time.
[07:59.10]And I'm not allowed to eat.
[08:00.30]I'm not eating.
[08:01.10]I'm not gonna drink.
[08:02.70]6800 hours.
[08:03.10]Nah, I'm just kidding you guys.
[08:07.05]That's when the stream's ending.
[08:08.27]At like 06800.
[08:09.85]Yeah, that's what you guys don't know.
[08:14.71]06800 hours is when the stream's gonna turn up.
[08:17.35]Whenever that is.
[08:18.03]What does that mean?
[08:18.81]Is that time?
[08:19.29]Is that a real time?
[08:24.92]Let's see what we do here.
[08:25.89]Let's go to Mexico.
[08:26.69]Looks like we're getting in the water.
[08:27.79]Yeah.
[08:30.53]Okay.
[08:32.91]Haha, yes, well, that's what makes you such an interesting fellow, Mr. Irish.
[08:38.66]Ah, Mr. Marston, I've come to wish you well.
[08:41.62]How are you, sir?
[08:42.58]I'm okay.
[08:44.05]It seems that our friend, Mr. Irish, is well-connected south of the border.
[08:49.29]Oh, it's true.
[08:51.11]They love me down there.
[08:52.21]It's like a second home.
[08:53.17]I've got more friends than you could shake a stick at, should you so desire.
[08:57.50]I do love this guy's, like, voice and accent, though.
[09:27.46]No, but not through lack of trying.
[09:29.36]Well, you boys have fun down there.
[09:32.14]I shall miss you, John Marston.
[09:34.86]Thank you.
[09:35.24]Where are you headed?
[09:36.51]Oh, me?
[09:37.07]Oh, London or Paris or maybe Peking.
[09:41.29]I'm a traveling man, sir.
[09:42.35]I'm not going to stream myself sleeping.
[09:46.85]Do you want to stream yourself sleeping?
[09:48.17]Do you want to play Hearthstone now?
[09:49.59]And I've paid you a lot of money.
[09:50.80]Yes, you have.
[09:51.12]Well, thank you.
[09:51.70]Alright, let's do it.
[09:52.34]No, no sleeping on stream.
[10:14.83]I remember watching when IRL first came out.
[10:17.31]This is like an IRL story.
[10:19.27]I don't think I've ever laughed this hard in my life.
[10:22.05]Somebody was streaming themselves sleeping with a playlist.
[10:26.92]You could request songs or something.
[10:30.12]And they had the headphones on.
[10:32.50]And they were sleeping in a bed.
[10:33.78]And people in the chat were just trying to find the loudest fucking shit to wake this guy up.
[10:39.94]And like somebody, somebody had this fucking piano song.
[10:43.98]It was literally just like a fucking, somebody mashing piano keys.
[10:49.47]I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
[10:50.77]It's fucking making me laugh about it a little bit.
[10:53.29]Oh my god, it was literally like... You guys know what I'm talking about.
[10:57.33]Like somebody's fucking hammering their hand on keys.
[10:59.55]And it was so loud.
[11:01.91]And this guy's sitting there sleeping with like his mouth open while this fucking song blasting in his ears and it didn't wake him up.
[11:09.10]That could have been, like, one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
[11:10.86]Like, how the fuck do you not wake up to that?
[11:12.20]And his headphones were on, and they were, like, turned up.
[11:15.90]So this is fucking, like, random.
[11:17.94]And this kid couldn't have been more than, like, fucking 14 or, like, 15, by the way.
[11:23.39]He was just sitting there sleeping.
[11:24.83]It was, like, the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen.
[11:29.81]Alright, now let me, like, play the game.
[11:31.35]Now I need to, like, take cover.
[11:32.46]God, it was so funny.
[11:36.98]I, like, wish I could find that song.
[11:39.51]I don't even know what it was.
[11:41.73]Everyone was contributing with their usual madness, right?
[11:45.95]But this one guy is a fucking brilliant person, whoever he is.
[11:49.45]You know, I'm gonna blast somebody's fucking mansion on a piano.
[11:56.14]You can see this guy's face was twitching a little.
[11:59.92]Every so often, his face would be like, like he was gonna wake up, but he just wouldn't.
[12:05.13]IRL streaming.
[12:09.04]God, it was fucking funny.
[12:10.40]Did Jerma watch his kids sleep?
[12:15.66]No!
[12:16.12]It was like on IRL!
[12:19.00]It was literally like an IRL scream that I like happened to- Holy shit!
[12:24.76]Okay, well he's dead.
[12:28.28]Hold on, did he scream after the fact?
[12:29.77]He screamed in the water.
[12:37.98]It's like, you guys don't do that.
[12:40.86]You guys sometimes just don't go to IRL and just scroll to the fucking bottom and see what's there.
[12:48.14]You haven't lived yet if you haven't done that, by the way.
[12:51.33]All kinds of shit there.
[12:53.31]Everybody knows the IRL streamers.
[12:55.95]There's some IRL people that play, you know, in real life video games.
[13:02.23]But, you know, besides the popular ones, next time you get a chance, trust me,
[13:09.74]Is this gonna breach?
[13:10.42]I don't know.
[13:15.82]Okay.
[13:16.82]Yeah, the next time you get a chance, like, make sure you get to IRL and go down to the people that have, like, four viewers.
[13:24.13]Some of them are... Sometimes it is a fucking shit show.
[13:26.95]Sometimes you get to see shit that is just like, holy fuck, what the hell am I watching?
[13:32.79]Oh my god, there's a lot of fucking people here, by the way.
[13:42.65]Come on, come on, come on.
[13:47.64]Got him.
[13:49.76]Got him.
[13:56.60]Come on, kill him.
[14:00.60]I'll be back, I'm going to the bottom of IRL.
[14:03.28]Not good, not good, not good, not good.
[14:11.80]This is not a good place to be.
[14:13.50]Can I have your spot?
[14:14.48]Give me your hiding spot.
[14:19.28]Oh my lord.
[14:19.88]Come on, dude.
[14:28.16]Come on, shoot him.
[14:34.99]Okay, finally.
[14:35.77]Jesus.
[14:36.11]Give me some more ammo.
[14:42.79]That was actually not easy.
[14:44.75]Who is Dark Souls 300 folks?
[14:45.56]What's going on?
[14:46.30]Bill Williamson.
[14:46.98]Oh my gosh.
[14:47.54]Funny moment.
[14:48.20]It's going to be like
[15:17.79]Hey!
[15:20.24]Thank you, Ashbringer.
[15:23.52]Ashbringer108 for the $15.
[15:27.86]No decision is permanent.
[15:28.78]Click the rewind button at any time if you want to scroll back and try again.
[15:33.06]We got a good path so far.
[15:35.02]Thank you for the $15.
[15:36.26]Much appreciated.
[15:38.36]And what is it?
[15:39.08]Are we just floating in the water?
[15:40.64]What?
[15:41.08]Okay.
[15:46.71]What?
[15:46.87]Wait, wait, no, I didn't want to fucking do that.
[15:52.51]Oh my lord.
[15:53.23]Okay, the game was just like fucked up right there.
[15:59.06]That was pretty dumb.
[16:04.42]A couple people through the woods.
[16:07.66]Come on, get that guy too.
[16:08.64]Get him.
[16:13.87]I don't know.
[16:15.21]No, I don't care.
[16:17.00]Stop fucking auto-locking the birds.
[16:25.00]Oh, shit.
[16:25.94]Oh, shit.
[16:30.14]Oh, shit.
[16:30.58]He's got it.
[16:30.96]He's got it on the boat.
[16:31.98]Did he get it on the boat?
[16:32.80]Oh, shit.
[16:34.52]Oh, god damn it.
[16:39.42]Oh, god damn it, man.
[16:40.78]Like, I blame the stupid fucking auto-locking birds.
[16:46.14]Do I have to do the whole thing?
[16:47.26]Thank God.
[16:49.96]Dude, can there be target priority in this game?
[16:55.65]Honest to God, don't auto-lock birds if there are criminals shooting at me.
[17:03.27]This weapon sucks too.
[17:08.79]Why did I have that one by default?
[17:16.52]Excuse me, did you assure you didn't want to lock on to a bird flying by?
[17:20.76]Seriously get up
[17:47.03]Okay, well, TNT guy has to die.
[17:49.27]Oh, my lord.
[17:54.91]They're loaded up.
[18:10.54]Mm-hmm.
[18:11.50]Yep.
[18:16.49]Is that all it takes to get to Mexico?
[18:17.79]Just to go down the river?
[18:19.71]Here he is.
[18:21.69]Right there.
[18:25.59]Get out of here.
[18:27.01]Roll down the hill.
[18:28.15]TNT guy is gone.
[18:30.33]Don't need to worry about this TNT anymore.
[18:37.28]Come on.
[18:38.14]Show your shed.
[18:39.42]Show your shed.
[18:40.30]Show your shed.
[18:41.82]Gotta reload this dumb rifle.
[18:47.25]No, who cares.
[18:50.12]Was that one of the last guy's head?
[18:58.14]I was just trying to get a bird, too.
[19:00.41]That would have been real dumb.
[19:02.49]Oh, headbutt!
[19:02.91]Did you want to shoot the flying frog?
[19:08.05]No, I wanted to shoot that guy.
[19:26.41]Reload it.
[19:26.81]Are there any flying frogs?
[19:29.25]Yeah, they are.
[19:29.61]What are you talking about?
[19:32.49]You guys don't know about... But you guys can go ahead and look it up.
[19:36.68]Amphibious dactylus.
[19:38.12]Excuse me.
[19:39.68]Thank you.
[19:44.54]Amphibious dactylus.
[19:54.47]Okie-dokie.
[20:00.29]Last guy, where is he?
[20:03.90]Crouch, please.
[20:08.28]Crouch, please.
[20:09.44]Yeah, the amphibious dactylus.
[20:15.60]A flying frog, also called the amphibious dactylus, has the ability to achieve gliding flight.
[20:19.87]That is, it can descend... Hold on, I need to pause this.
[20:23.87]A flying frog, also called a gliding frog, is a frog that has the ability to achieve gliding flying.
[20:27.92]That is, it can descend at an angle less than 45 degrees relative to the horizontal.
[20:31.54]Other non-flying... It's gone, but you saw it.
[20:35.78]Thank you, DubskiDude, for the three bucks.
[20:38.62]Not sure if they patched this or not, but using Deadeye to throw a Molotov at a bird is the funniest thing you'll ever see.
[20:43.82]Okay.
[20:45.02]And JayKlaser, thank you for the ten bucks.
[20:48.04]Remember your slacks tweet.
[20:49.22]Did you ever get slacks?
[20:50.22]Also, buy some Hearthstone packs, idiot.
[20:53.27]Well, thank you, J.K.
[20:54.43]Laser.
[20:55.10]J. Clazer.
[20:55.92]Oh, hey, hey, J. Clazer.
[20:57.84]This is not good.
[21:00.96]I gotta, like, do this now.
[21:02.68]Like, I'm reloading the fucking gun right now.
[21:12.62]Get him, please.
[21:13.32]I'm not gonna hit that guy.
[21:21.93]Is he still alive after that shit?
[21:24.97]Are you kidding me?
[21:28.03]Show your head.
[21:35.65]I think I blew himself up.
[21:39.71]I don't know why.
[21:40.33]Okay, time slowed down for all of us except for the views.
[21:42.69]Google image flying frog.
[21:43.58]You guys got it.
[21:44.52]It's over.
[21:52.00]There's a beach coming up on the left.
[21:53.56]Oh, God.
[21:54.62]We'll be on dry land soon.
[21:56.36]Oh, God.
[21:57.23]No.
[21:57.71]You see, I was right.
[22:01.87]We shoot that bird.
[22:02.81]God, the bird was attacking too.
[22:04.21]Oh, my God.
[22:04.97]Get out of the way.
[22:08.93]Now let's get on our steeds.
[22:11.08]Let's get on our steeds.
[22:13.28]And everything.
[22:14.62]And here it comes.
[22:15.60]Oh, yo, dude.
[22:34.19]Hold on a second.
[22:34.88]Let me get really ready to play Red Dead.
[22:36.50]You know what I'm talking about?
[22:37.42]I met an American guy...
[22:47.22]Oh, that's fucking, oh, wow, top of the line shit.
[22:50.40]Oh, yeah.
[22:50.56]Boring streamer.
[22:51.60]Nice boring rip.
[22:52.52]Content.
[22:53.36]He's a real nice chap.
[23:15.22]It's funny because it's about weed, and he goes, no, that's a joke.
[23:17.78]I'm uncomfortable now.
[23:18.38]Oh, but I just drained a bone on stream.
[23:20.62]Good weed joke.
[23:21.22]Don't ever laugh at any marijuana jokes.
[23:24.31]If somebody says, like, blaze at 420, just stare at them.
[23:26.71]With a dead stare.
[23:44.00]Next time somebody says, yo, blades at 420, fucking stare in his eyes and just, like, have to purse your lips like, you motherfucker.
[23:55.24]Like... Wait, hold on.
[24:03.13]Might as well do this, right?
[24:06.81]You know, birds of a feather fucking flock together.
[24:11.97]Alright, so there's, uh, LD, uh, LR.
[24:14.74]There's Lead Dead Redemption.
[24:19.18]Okay, so we got Red Dead Redemption over there on the right.
[24:25.12]Am I in Mexico now?
[24:27.44]No, I'm not.
[24:29.57]I guess I am, right?
[24:38.25]Birds of a Feather auto-aim together.
[24:43.31]Let's go to fucking Red Direction.
[24:45.75]Okay, I'm sorry.
[24:47.15]I'm sorry, guys.
[24:49.71]I can't fast travel to, like, go find it, right?
[24:51.43]This actually is beautiful.
[24:53.76]The other side of the wall is, like, gorgeous.
[24:56.32]The other side of the fucking north of the wall.
[24:58.78]South of the wall.
[24:59.48]I've been watching Game of Thrones lately.
[25:04.04]I've been catching up.
[25:05.08]Winter seasons this week.
[25:10.80]Where do I want to go first?
[25:13.91]I mean, I guess I have to... I'll just go with this one first.
[25:19.57]Nice reference.
[25:20.67]Thanks.
[25:21.65]Sometimes I try to do a reference.
[25:22.91]Hey, Louie, thanks for the bits.
[25:24.19]Thanks for the one buck.
[25:26.19]One buck-o-rino.
[25:29.01]Thanks to everybody that's been subbing, too.
[25:31.90]I love y'all.
[25:34.22]I'm gonna ruin the music.
[25:35.16]What do I do?
[25:36.82]Spell eye cup.
[25:39.22]Why?
[25:43.08]Is that a pee-pee joke?
[25:46.79]I refuse.
[25:50.99]Where's the music?
[25:51.57]I don't know.
[25:51.85]Is there the B music right now?
[26:04.77]That's not how you spell it.
[26:05.99]I'm sure it is.
[26:13.76]I feel when Dremel will read out $1 but won't read out a $5 sub.
[26:17.73]I'm so sorry.
[26:19.05]Look, we'll talk about this again.
[26:20.69]I have to bring this up every time.
[26:23.86]I'm like, I'm going to, don't worry.
[26:26.26]Like, I talked to fucking Blordow.
[26:28.80]We're going to get a solution.
[26:30.41]All you longtime subs, all you expensive subs, because there are a couple of you guys, there are some people that have the, I think there's at least one of you that has the $25 a month sub.
[26:38.17]That's a lot.
[26:39.47]So, like, I'm so sorry that I haven't been reading subs.
[26:46.14]But it's, I just, it's difficult for me to explain.
[26:54.05]Die so you can hear the song.
[26:55.39]Is that what happened?
[26:57.29]It's not the same without a teeth cam.
[27:01.97]Now, this is not a complaint at all.
[27:04.29]I just want to make sure you guys know that if you subscribe... It's not that I don't notice it, that I don't care.
[27:11.96]I think what I'm going to have to end up doing is... It's going to be one of those situations where I'm going to have to, like...
[27:24.86]I don't know.
[27:25.52]I don't know.
[27:25.96]I don't know.
[27:31.89]I have to find a solution where this doesn't become a money stream.
[27:34.43]That's not what I want.
[27:39.35]Because remember, a lot of these go up on YouTube.
[27:41.57]And I've said, we've talked about it, this is a broken record at this point, but like... These streams are edited down to videos.
[27:48.31]Almost all of them.
[27:49.26]At least the ones that are like, worth watching again, right?
[27:51.72]You'll never see a Karazhan video.
[27:53.84]Like, on my second channel ever.
[27:56.36]You know, but the ones that are worth like, watching again, because there's things that happened, things that were funny, things that were interesting.
[28:02.97]I'd rather be able to be able to be a video.
[28:06.39]And not necessarily have to have, like, you know, edit around shoutouts.
[28:13.74]Have dedicated sub, like, sections.
[28:15.74]That's probably what I'm going to end up doing.
[28:20.78]It's not against like anybody anybody that's giving money or anything.
[28:25.28]It's I just want a I want to like do a broadcast like a stream And sometimes that requires and dude sometimes I miss like fucking huge donations, and it irritates me because obviously I don't want people to think that I don't care and
[28:46.21]But I also don't want to run a broadcast that is me yelling out names every, you know, 25 seconds.
[28:52.63]Or every, like, minute.
[28:53.59]It's like me stopping what I was doing to say, like, hey, thank you for this, thank you for that, thank you for this.
[28:59.54]And that's not to say I don't want to say thank you.
[29:02.28]I appreciate every fucking cent that anybody gives this channel.
[29:05.56]Whether it's a long-term person or a short-term person.
[29:15.45]Just read everyone's... I actually might do that.
[29:17.21]I might, like, read all the subs at the end.
[29:18.65]I have to think of a solution.
[29:21.15]Thank you, letters.
[29:21.63]No, sir.
[29:43.60]Pardon, pero yo habla un solo poquito español.
[29:46.78]He doesn't speak that language.
[29:49.66]Habla English?
[29:50.98]Oh, si, gringo.
[29:52.68]Hablo mucho inglés.
[29:54.12]Hablo.
[29:56.15]filthy fucking bean eater.
[29:58.35]I'm a slippery little Mexican.
[30:01.68]I'm a little piece of shit.
[30:05.10]Comprende, amigo?
[30:06.00]Comprende?
[30:06.52]I don't know what that one means.
[30:07.80]Hey, what are you doing here, gringo?
[30:11.30]I don't remember inviting you to my country.
[30:13.61]I don't think you did, amigo.
[30:17.21]I mean you no harm.
[30:18.51]Sensitive audio.
[30:19.47]You mean I have no harm?
[30:23.13]This is funny.
[30:24.64]Racist stream.
[30:28.87]Calm down.
[30:31.07]Just chill out.
[30:34.19]It's okay.
[30:35.05]Just a little bit of this, you know, a little bit of this.
[30:37.79]There's some shit on screen.
[30:39.75]We got, yeah, okay.
[30:40.83]Such beautiful land.
[30:42.11]Any further unpleasantries?
[30:44.58]If you'll excuse me.
[30:46.56]Hold it, Gringo.
[30:47.42]I think you're forgetting something.
[30:49.62]A little taxation.
[30:53.00]I have a large family.
[30:54.76]Very big.
[30:57.28]I too have a family friend.
[30:59.50]So when we see our families again, I suggest we part ways amicably.
[31:04.12]I don't know, bad words in a video game.
[31:08.28]Okay, now you stole my hat, and that's not cool.
[31:10.44]You don't take another man's hat.
[31:12.47]Can I see the boots, gringo?
[31:14.83]I think you can see them from where you're standing just fine, senor.
[31:17.47]Uh-oh.
[31:21.33]Take off the boots, Americano.
[31:23.01]Uh-oh.
[31:23.75]Am I going to have to do a dead-eye walk in here?
[31:26.97]As you wish.
[31:28.47]Uh-oh.
[31:30.81]It's gonna be one, two, three.
[31:31.93]One, two, three.
[31:32.43]Right in the heads.
[31:33.13]Bang, bang, bang!
[31:34.57]Got it.
[31:39.70]I'll take my hat back now.
[31:43.04]Oh, very good.
[31:45.56]Very good indeed, sir.
[31:48.93]What a great way to improve border relations.
[31:52.22]An illiterate farmer crossing the river, coming into their civilization and butchering the local peasants?
[31:57.68]He's got a point.
[31:59.92]Thank you very much, sir.
[32:02.41]Don't mention it, old man.
[32:04.81]You kill peasants, you become a peasant.
[32:07.63]That was me, by the way.
[32:08.27]I did those shots.
[32:09.09]A socialist, huh?
[32:16.16]Socialist dog, take my back, you must be a Bernie Sanders supporter.
[32:19.76]What am I doing?
[32:20.16]Most of them bad.
[32:21.66]But a man of political principles?
[32:22.90]What am I doing?
[32:25.10]I'm breaking my own rule.
[32:29.04]Don't you worry about me.
[32:30.82]Oh, but I do worry.
[32:31.90]I'm sorry.
[32:32.71]An angry man a long way from home?
[32:34.65]A man who handles a gun as sly as you?
[32:38.11]I can handle a gun okay, partner.
[32:39.93]As long as you're killing quail or peasants.
[32:42.39]Why, why?
[32:43.15]If you have to face another man, you don't stand a chance.
[32:46.57]And you do?
[32:48.09]I can show you a few tricks.
[32:49.28]It's in your rules.
[32:50.96]I know, I know.
[32:52.94]What's your name?
[32:54.64]I know.
[32:56.08]And you?
[32:57.76]I never had a name, mister.
[32:59.46]I was raised in an orphanage.
[33:03.11]A real American.
[33:06.81]Breaking my own rules.
[33:09.50]Sorry Sorry, it's gonna be fine.
[33:11.96]It was that was like that wasn't even like a political joke.
[33:14.68]That was just it was very very clearly me making like a Politically charged joke.
[33:22.13]It was a political joke.
[33:23.11]It's over like it don't even matter Now who are you?
[33:29.35]No, no, no, no, no, no, no don't tell me I don't tell me that I don't land in Ricketts Not a name that means much anymore
[33:37.63]Means a little.
[33:38.81]You were famous when I was a boy.
[33:42.91]Yeah, killing men's a strange kind of fame.
[33:46.65]I was the fastest in my time.
[33:48.15]I must have been.
[33:49.79]I'm the only one left.
[33:50.71]What are you doing here?
[33:54.33]Living quietly.
[33:56.95]Waiting.
[33:58.63]For what?
[34:01.21]I don't know.
[34:02.98]And you?
[34:04.10]It's just, it's just, it's just un-fucking-believable.
[34:06.46]Hello?
[34:06.66]Hello?
[34:06.98]Okay, well, I'm good.
[34:07.94]I'm good.
[34:08.14]Alright, we're good now?
[34:32.23]Now there's another local guy running around promising the peasants they're friendly.
[34:37.09]Just like the last two or three.
[34:40.20]Local government.
[34:42.42]Good thing you couldn't hear me.
[34:43.38]I was fucking raging.
[34:44.64]Colonel Allende, he runs this place like a feudal king.
[34:49.20]He's an awful individual.
[34:50.22]It'd be funny if they were vaping instead of smoking.
[34:53.00]Why?
[34:53.34]What?
[34:53.48]Why would they be vaping?
[34:55.80]It'd be the worst decision Rockstar could ever make.
[35:00.42]Otherwise it makes the gun jump.
[35:03.99]But thank you.
[35:04.87]Oh, wait, hold on.
[35:05.51]See if the skull field makes a difference.
[35:07.67]Ooh, that's my favorite gun.
[35:15.80]Oh, I can actually tag.
[35:16.72]Oh, come on.
[35:19.06]I can't tag this guy.
[35:19.90]Oh, I can tag this guy.
[35:21.12]No, I can't.
[35:22.26]I actually love the skull field.
[35:22.98]Skull field's my favorite gun in Fistful of Frags.
[35:33.40]So cool.
[35:33.88]I like it.
[35:34.94]The only gun I got gold in multiplayer.
[35:36.51]These birds are huge!
[35:37.93]What are these, like, gargoyles?
[35:39.05]Look at these fucking gargoyles!
[36:02.63]Oh, no, they're turkeys.
[36:03.41]Okay, they're turkeys.
[36:04.23]Alright, well, we're going to have fresh fucking turkey dinner.
[36:13.98]Nice.
[36:14.54]I'd have to say I'm surprised you heard of Landon Ricketts.
[36:17.94]I would have thought an old goat like me would have been long forgotten by now.
[36:22.00]I heard many a story when I was a boy.
[36:24.36]Still do sometimes.
[36:26.04]What, these days?
[36:27.38]I find that hard to believe.
[36:29.65]This is a real, like, American game.
[36:31.17]Turkey dinner for everybody.
[36:33.29]Fellas arguing over who's the toughest, who's the fastest, and who shot people in the back.
[36:39.71]Like, trolling you guys.
[36:41.33]A troll.
[36:42.13]What a troll.
[36:42.91]That might be my favorite thing in the world.
[36:44.92]I think you move for the... Ah, hold on.
[36:48.28]I'll get you in a second.
[36:51.96]Flying frog turkeys.
[36:52.78]Getting back into politics.
[36:53.70]That's not politics.
[36:54.90]Talking about turkeys and shit.
[37:14.85]But hey, moo means moo, thanks for the bits, as we say.
[37:17.49]Remember, if for some reason the song didn't kick in riding into Mexico, please do us a favor and watch a clip on YouTube.
[37:23.03]The song with the scenery is one of the best moments in a video game.
[37:26.35]In video games.
[37:28.44]Well, I love the screen, by the way.
[37:31.20]Nice!
[37:32.40]I abandoned Ricket.
[37:33.84]Okay.
[37:36.53]Oh, I don't want to eat frog's legs.
[37:37.78]No.
[37:38.64]No, absolutely not.
[37:39.54]That's like my favorite animal.
[37:40.62]I would never eat frog's legs.
[37:42.84]That's like my favorite animal.
[37:47.28]Why would I ever eat my favorite animal?
[37:49.72]This shit's gonna happen again.
[37:55.12]Get out of the fucking way.
[37:57.80]Are you serious?
[37:59.76]Oh my god.
[38:01.08]It's that game.
[38:01.88]What the fuck?
[38:05.90]Okay, don't turn, because you'll get stuck on this wood over here.
[38:11.82]Go this way.
[38:13.23]Holy shit.
[38:17.15]Okay, anyway.
[38:18.79]I would never eat my favorite animal.
[38:21.52]Let me, like, take this off of my screen.
[38:25.47]But, yeah.
[38:27.07]I will listen to the song at some point here soon.
[38:29.05]Thank you, though, Moo.
[38:30.43]Also, thank you to Torbarsk for the seven bucks.
[38:32.63]Hello, favorite internet man.
[38:33.83]Is there any way for a grown-up boy to send you an actual serious fan letter?
[38:37.91]No pee-pee jokes.
[38:39.25]No promises.
[38:40.76]Uh, well... Uh, no.
[38:43.60]I don't have like a P.O.
[38:45.42]Box or anything like that.
[38:47.32]I don't know, that shit kinda scares me.
[38:49.42]A little.
[38:50.04]If I'm honest.
[38:52.19]Like, I'm gonna be like real honest with you, like I thought about doing like a P.O.
[38:55.05]Box and like, oh, people can send me shit.
[38:57.17]Um, you ever seen iDubbbz's videos?
[38:59.77]Where he opens up like a P.O.
[39:01.07]Box for people to send shit and people send him like fucking like heinous, awful shit in the mail?
[39:07.05]I don't want to open up my PO Box and there's a dead bird in there.
[39:10.51]You know what I mean?
[39:15.46]For every person that would want to... I double killed that guy.
[39:32.13]I didn't shoot him!
[39:33.01]He did!
[39:33.41]Why did he shoot him?
[39:38.26]I didn't shoot!
[39:38.98]He shot him in the fucking head!
[39:44.18]What?
[39:46.54]Hold your fire, dude!
[39:47.68]What the hell?
[39:48.56]I didn't shoot him!
[39:57.94]Oh my god.
[39:59.88]Don't do this to me.
[40:04.01]But anyways, that's what held me back from a BL bomb.
[40:09.64]J.K.
[40:10.00]Laser, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[40:12.00]Spell, I cuff before the dog pees his pants.
[40:18.32]Alright, alright, alright.
[40:19.72]I'll spell it.
[40:20.92]I'll spell it, okay?
[40:21.94]Don't worry.
[40:22.46]I'm gonna spell it.
[40:24.94]In a second.
[40:25.94]I'm gonna do Deadeye correctly on these guys.
[40:30.48]Keep your distance and use Deadeye to take out the captor.
[40:32.30]Okay, so wait, did I just get too close?
[40:46.58]Got it.
[40:47.42]Gracias.
[40:47.70]I can play the DLCs?
[40:48.85]Probably.
[40:49.31]I probably will play the DLC.
[41:02.56]The game is very good.
[41:03.76]Why wouldn't it?
[41:04.26]Gorgeous, though.
[41:04.66]Oh, I wish they put this game on PC and made it, like, good.
[41:06.60]Oh.
[41:06.70]Shoot the lantern.
[41:07.60]It burns underground.
[41:32.53]Did that work?
[41:33.29]Kind of.
[41:36.17]I guess.
[41:37.13]Where's it going?
[41:37.69]It's just going.
[41:38.87]Okay, it's just gone.
[41:40.23]Goodbye.
[41:40.79]Goodbye.
[41:41.21]That was not cool.
[41:42.79]Poor horses.
[41:43.69]Nice job.
[42:06.45]I didn't kill those cowboys.
[42:08.86]I mean, those powerses.
[42:10.32]Why are they... What am I talking about?
[42:11.92]Oh, nice whiskey.
[42:13.24]Can I shave that giant caterpillar off his face?
[42:15.18]Current Deadeye level 3 of 3.
[42:16.80]I'm getting famous.
[42:17.56]It's an honor.
[42:18.06]Okay.
[42:34.21]Well, that was fun.
[42:35.41]Now what do we do?
[42:36.33]Let's do... Okay, let's go back to land.
[42:39.25]Should I keep going?
[42:42.44]Oh, we're here.
[42:42.92]Might as well stay with Landon and Ricketts.
[42:45.38]Is there a... Is there a bar over here?
[42:47.56]You know what I mean?
[42:49.38]Is there a fucking bar?
[42:52.10]Is there a bar that I can have a fucking couple hours of time on?
[42:55.14]Oh, nice.
[43:09.91]Did you guys pay for a dance?
[43:12.17]No, joke ruined.
[43:16.65]Never mind.
[43:17.66]Is there a dance emote?
[43:22.54]Come back between 7am and 10pm.
[43:26.18]So what time is it now?
[43:28.96]Huh?
[43:31.73]It's not between 7am and 10pm.
[43:37.79]What fucking time is it then?
[43:40.71]Do you want to make some money?
[43:42.43]Follow the stranger to listen to his proposal.
[43:45.33]Sure, let's listen.
[43:46.09]Am I going to get robbed here?
[43:56.90]Should I be prepared?
[43:57.56]I'm just going to have my knife ready just to be prepared.
[44:02.46]What's your proposal?
[44:03.78]They're delivering provisions to the market.
[44:05.66]You steal one of the wagons, I give you good money.
[44:08.22]Okay.
[44:11.16]Sure.
[44:15.82]Steal the wagon.
[44:19.27]Am I gonna get, like, a bounty for this?
[44:23.81]Alright, for a second I thought, was that girl just checking a cell phone?
[44:28.65]Like, in GTA 5, was she holding up, like, a cell phone and taking a selfie?
[44:33.28]What was that?
[44:34.34]You guys saw that.
[44:40.32]Bandana?
[44:41.56]Oh, wait.
[44:42.16]I bought one.
[44:42.60]Where is it?
[44:48.76]How do I put it on?
[44:54.53]It's on.
[44:56.09]Now nobody will know who I am, right?
[45:04.15]What's in the back here?
[45:07.55]Oh, wow.
[45:08.47]Fucking... Oh, I can't believe they're fucking shipping off that bootleg cereal.
[45:14.45]Wow.
[45:14.81]Like, bag Captain Crunch.
[45:17.11]That's what's in there.
[45:25.63]I gotta get these fucking, like, super crunches out of here.
[45:30.71]Come on, that was...
[45:34.07]Come on, that was a good joke.
[45:35.19]You guys know that, like, bag cereal?
[45:36.89]Like, the bootleg bag cereal?
[45:41.08]It's not bad, but it's not good either.
[45:42.74]Alright, we're good.
[45:48.86]I'm gonna have to drive this back into town anyways.
[45:51.48]Is that guy shooting at me?
[45:54.08]Yeah, seriously.
[45:58.10]Whoa.
[46:00.01]Whoa.
[46:03.41]Whoa, easy horses.
[46:05.35]Whoa there.
[46:06.01]You guys are okay.
[46:10.89]Oh my god, my face is so itchy right now.
[46:13.75]God, can we like... Pollen, seriously.
[46:16.77]I blame pollen for this one.
[46:19.06]This shit wouldn't have happened if there wasn't pollen in my room.
[46:24.10]I have no fucking Xbox control.
[46:26.26]What?
[46:28.71]The fuck is this guy doing?
[46:33.12]My whole face is itching.
[46:43.38]I'm about to get, I'm about to go buy, I'm gonna get a new face in a second.
[46:47.27]I'm gonna go to the fucking plastic surgeon guy.
[46:48.89]I'm gonna go to a doctor and be like, hey, peel this fucking whole face off and put somebody else's face on me like John Travolta.
[46:53.77]I want John Travolta's face.
[46:56.05]You, I've seen that movie.
[46:57.01]You can do it.
[47:00.02]Cut to, like, me, like, in handcuffs.
[47:03.02]Yeah, this Xbox controller is, like, fucking releasing pollen into the air.
[47:10.68]Every time I press X. That was close.
[47:17.91]I almost ran the guy over.
[47:18.85]53 bucks, damn.
[47:19.67]That was actually worth it.
[47:29.84]Thank you.
[47:31.90]Alright.
[47:33.90]Well, thank you for the, uh... Aww.
[47:47.45]I was hoping he was gonna drive off.
[47:50.65]Hey, lightning boy!
[47:54.59]I'm not going to shoot him.
[47:55.17]He might have more work.
[47:56.19]That was the most that anyone's ever paid me for anything.
[47:58.69]And here's this guy that's still following me.
[48:01.82]This guy's still chasing me, right?
[48:03.50]This guy's been firing at me and following me around.
[48:07.28]The whole mission.
[48:08.78]He's going to pull his gun out.
[48:09.62]He's going to go, there you are.
[48:10.66]Now you're dead.
[48:13.02]Maybe not.
[48:16.02]Okay.
[48:18.53]Let's get the bandana off.
[48:20.49]Don't need this anymore.
[48:25.27]I think they just ran that guy off the road.
[48:31.01]He's going the same way.
[48:35.83]Alright, the map.
[48:38.12]Let's go back to Landon.
[48:39.76]Let's go back to Lando Calrissian.
[48:42.34]Star Wars joke.
[48:43.24]That's a Star Wars joke.
[48:49.94]Yes, Regis.
[48:51.03]I'll take Star Wars references for 400.
[48:53.63]That's an early level.
[48:55.93]Let's go see LD.
[49:14.48]No, LR or whatever.
[49:18.41]Dude, I'm so glad that... I love just fucking running people over.
[49:26.45]Muy interesante.
[49:28.09]Gracias, amigo.
[49:28.61]Mr. Marston, how the devil are you?
[49:29.81]You're fine.
[49:30.19]How are you, Mr. Reitz?
[49:31.09]I'm good.
[49:31.37]I'm glad to hear it, because these men were just telling me about Mr. Azcuela.
[49:34.54]Javier Azcuela?
[49:35.24]Emilio, let me ask you something.
[49:36.28]His nombre is Javier Sr.
[49:36.98]Azcuela is Javier T.C.?
[49:37.92]No se, señor.
[49:52.27]Also, thank you to Liler for the five bucks.
[49:55.15]What's the best way to find Will Smith in the snow?
[49:58.58]Mustache.
[49:59.78]Did he have an American in tow?
[50:01.96]Big American?
[50:03.42]Emilio.
[50:04.76]Rhyme of the Americano?
[50:07.30]No.
[50:11.40]Again, I got that.
[50:13.91]But they do have his sister.
[50:15.95]Emilio's, I mean.
[50:18.11]She's a fine young woman, teacher, a human being, not the clothed vermin so many people seem to have turned into.
[50:27.09]Tell him I'm sorry.
[50:28.39]When a man's family is involved, you need a little more enthusiasm than mere apologies.
[50:32.71]I have enough worries, sir.
[50:34.79]This man's problems pain me, but they're not quite my own.
[50:37.93]Those who sit on the fence make a choice in their own way.
[50:41.64]Don't you think, Mr. Marston?
[50:43.40]Are you laughing?
[50:43.94]I'm fine.
[50:45.36]What about you, Reckless?
[50:47.22]A man living in the past?
[50:49.04]A man who ran away from home?
[50:50.58]What choice did you make?
[50:51.54]I'll tell you what choice I made.
[50:54.38]I'm a fighter, sir, and I'll fight to the end.
[50:57.96]I think we should get going.
[51:01.11]You can feel my silent laughter.
[51:02.49]What?
[51:02.61]What are you talking about?
[51:03.46]I chuckled at it.
[51:04.20]It was a clever piece of literal linguistics.
[51:09.50]I want to take the train.
[51:14.61]There's probably plenty of funny LOL moments on that train, you know what I mean?
[51:19.77]I can't wait to get into, like, top, like, the clips.
[51:27.43]Red Dead Redemption clips compilation.
[51:31.03]Funny fails and funny wins.
[51:32.55]Number, like, 78.
[51:32.87]I can't wait.
[51:33.29]By the way, I... John L. O'Connor.
[51:49.74]Dude, top wins and fails.
[51:51.84]I'm going to get on the train and he's going to fall off.
[51:53.80]I didn't do it.
[51:54.81]He fell off the train.
[51:56.05]And it's going to get on top wins and fails.
[51:59.03]Nice stutter.
[52:01.49]I do have a stammer when I get going.
[52:02.93]It does happen sometimes.
[52:05.13]Especially when I'm trying to think and talk at the same time.
[52:07.21]It doesn't usually work that well.
[52:08.92]I'm doing it right now.
[52:14.08]This is going to be so epic.
[52:16.56]I don't need to stutter.
[52:29.53]No, I didn't say that, I said I do.
[52:37.43]I think this is just a train ride.
[52:38.69]I don't think I can do anything.
[52:39.50]There's no funny LOL moments on this train.
[52:43.56]Well, just like a train ride.
[52:54.62]What an epic moment.
[52:56.97]No, I can't shoot out the window.
[53:05.71]Epic.
[53:07.65]Trains.
[53:08.45]That's so funny.
[53:23.39]There should be some horses for us across the way.
[53:25.56]Ugh, but what about my funny train moments?
[53:29.48]What's that?
[53:30.70]Is that a chest?
[53:34.34]No, I can't do anything.
[53:41.25]Oh well.
[53:42.17]There'll be another time for a funny train moment at some point.
[53:44.41]Alright, let's head to El Matadero and see what they know about Luisa.
[53:50.83]This is fucking beautiful though.
[53:52.64]Holy shit.
[53:52.92]We need to find a man called Carlos.
[53:55.10]I was told he could help us.
[53:56.56]We'll ask around when we get there.
[53:58.48]This game really is just, like, beautiful.
[54:01.54]For being almost ten years old at this point.
[54:05.31]Rockstar knows how to make video games, that's for sure.
[54:07.89]She's a rebel, and apparently close to their leader, Reyes.
[54:11.27]She's a pretty young thing.
[54:12.71]That's normally reason enough for Arlindae.
[54:14.87]So I've heard.
[54:15.95]She's a good woman.
[54:17.12]A teacher.
[54:17.84]If they lay a finger on her, I swear I'll feed those bastards their balls.
[54:27.54]Here we are.
[54:28.71]Looks kind of sleepy, don't it?
[54:29.85]Here we are.
[54:31.73]The guy sounds like the voice that I do sometimes when I do the one voice.
[54:37.11]It's like fucking Carl Pewterschmidt from Family Guy.
[54:42.10]That's what I do sometimes.
[54:45.77]That's some fucking originality.
[54:46.69]You know what I'm saying?
[54:52.77]Carlos.
[54:53.72]Si.
[54:55.04]We're here for Luisa.
[54:56.00]Is she still being held up in the caves?
[54:57.62]Yes.
[54:58.94]She's still up there.
[55:00.84]Family Guy funny moments.
[55:02.44]We're here to help.
[55:04.68]Muy bien.
[55:06.40]I can distract the guards.
[55:08.68]You and the gringo can get inside.
[55:10.10]Family Guy epic moments.
[55:12.56]Let's do it.
[55:17.58]I will keep them talking, senor.
[55:19.28]The rest I will leave to you.
[55:20.64]I want the shotgun.
[55:26.28]Oh, whoa.
[55:26.64]Fireworks.
[55:29.03]That's like bricks.
[55:30.07]That's like jumping jacks.
[55:31.71]This thing's the best.
[55:35.49]I have to walk too, right?
[55:46.97]No, actually, this looks like a meeting.
[55:49.59]Probably should take out the Springfield.
[55:52.21]I'm talking about, like, Simpsons jokes, right?
[55:56.41]Lighten the cover with a distraction, and then start fire.
[56:02.21]That looks like it hurt.
[56:10.59]The scenery of this game is just a mash of everything beautiful in North America.
[56:14.35]It is true.
[56:16.81]Yeah, so donate to your fucking conservation services.
[56:20.45]You want the Grand Canyon to still be there?
[56:21.95]In like another 4,200 years?
[56:26.45]Then fucking support your local wildlife conservation.
[56:29.00]There's an argument here.
[56:47.80]He said something was beautiful.
[56:48.78]Can I see what they're saying?
[56:50.48]Inferno fire.
[56:50.78]Can we just go?
[56:51.54]We don't have to save our friend?
[56:53.86]I guess not.
[56:54.79]Going into caves.
[56:55.41]I wanted to, but I don't want to ruin the mission.
[57:16.33]Holy shit.
[57:30.91]It's that easy.
[57:32.27]That Deadeye is so much fun.
[57:33.43]Especially with the fucking Schofield.
[57:35.87]I'm gonna do it right now.
[57:39.17]Don't get up!
[57:39.51]What are you doing?
[57:40.75]What are you doing?
[57:41.55]What the fuck are you thinking?
[57:44.47]You shouldn't be up there that far.
[57:45.97]Come on, you don't have very much blood left.
[57:47.87]You only got like six pints left.
[57:50.99]Come on, you can sneak back over here.
[57:52.29]You only got like 14 holes in you.
[57:53.91]You're almost there.
[57:54.73]Yeah, you're doing good.
[57:56.39]You're doing a run towards him.
[57:57.81]Now do like doggy style.
[57:59.49]Yeah, get down.
[57:59.91]Do downward dog.
[58:00.77]That'll save you.
[58:01.85]This time now lie down on your back.
[58:03.03]Yeah, alright.
[58:04.31]Right in the face.
[58:04.74]Good jump back.
[58:05.34]Nice train.
[58:06.08]That's how you take a bump in wrestling.
[58:09.06]I'll take care of this.
[58:11.34]Oh shit.
[58:11.54]I didn't mean to.
[58:12.59]Wait, wait, wait.
[58:13.21]Alright, he's good.
[58:13.71]I should be looting these guys.
[58:15.35]I'm not.
[58:37.20]No, no, no, no, no, no, we don't want to talk about Game of Thrones.
[58:40.34]No Game of Thrones.
[58:41.20]Oh, Kim, that was a mistake.
[58:42.67]Nobody say anything about Game of Thrones.
[58:44.17]Don't say anything.
[58:44.91]If you say anything about Game of Thrones, you're permanently banned from the channel.
[58:46.75]Permanently.
[58:47.13]Forever.
[58:56.97]And...
[59:03.08]No fucking... Oh, what are you thinking?
[59:06.28]What are you thinking with that one?
[59:10.11]Well... Alrighty.
[59:13.99]Watch out for the two fucking rangers.
[59:17.17]These are the guys from before, right?
[59:18.67]Nice, like, snake.
[59:20.34]What are you...
[59:36.13]Sitting here like trying to control my chat from like Game of Thrones spoilers.
[59:41.39]Oh, this is so annoying.
[59:45.00]Oh my god.
[59:54.82]That wasn't my fault.
[59:55.65]I'm like sitting there trying to like tell people not to give like the massive spoilers about Game of Thrones.
[60:03.59]And then I fucking die.
[60:06.18]Oh my god.
[60:07.06]Fucking please, just get over here.
[60:24.93]Can we just go?
[60:25.65]Do we have to wait for him?
[60:27.15]Where is he?
[60:29.33]Where's Lando Calrissian?
[60:30.47]Where is he?
[60:30.82]He's not here.
[60:34.30]Where's my partner?
[60:37.59]Isn't there supposed to be another guy with me?
[60:38.71]I don't understand.
[60:43.45]Oh, okay.
[60:44.13]He's very well hidden.
[60:45.21]We have to do this again.
[60:50.27]Oh, my God.
[61:04.25]No, stand.
[61:04.87]Don't.
[61:05.57]Stand.
[61:06.15]Stand.
[61:06.85]Ay, ay, ay.
[61:11.97]Oh, no, no.
[61:12.69]Speaking of ay, ay, ay, my fucking internet's dying.
[61:15.23]Don't do this.
[61:16.39]Don't fucking do this right now.
[61:18.25]My internet's like shitting the bed.
[61:21.61]Better not be.
[61:23.61]Oh, God.
[61:25.25]Don't even fucking do this shit.
[61:27.27]I swear to God.
[61:28.18]I say we've waited long enough.
[61:30.56]I swear to God, like, no.
[61:32.48]No, Comcast, don't do this right now.
[61:34.61]I'm going to be so upset if this happens.
[61:41.21]Seems like it's alright.
[61:44.69]Don't you dare do this.
[61:51.78]This guy's not even paying attention.
[61:52.84]Kill that guy.
[61:54.32]Where's the other guy?
[61:54.85]Where's this one?
[61:55.51]Whatever, just kill them all.
[61:57.21]This guy's a terrible guy.
[62:05.31]Here we go again.
[62:05.83]Remember this?
[62:06.25]Alright, one more.
[62:17.72]What are you doing back there?
[62:19.59]What am I doing back here?
[62:20.37]What are you doing out there?
[62:21.81]Should be the real question.
[62:23.61]You shouldn't be that far up.
[62:25.51]Have you played PUBG?
[62:27.09]I got a lot of shit in PUBG for doing what you're doing.
[62:30.11]But don't talk shit about me.
[62:31.19]Talk shit about you.
[62:39.43]Don't shoot the box three times.
[62:47.68]I'm going to see if I can blow the door open.
[62:49.66]You keep guard.
[62:50.82]Don't yell at me about PUBG.
[62:54.09]Remember the snake.
[62:55.35]We've got to watch the snake.
[62:56.71]It's going to happen again, right?
[62:58.21]It's going to be funny.
[63:00.29]No, it's not.
[63:00.77]Just kill the people.
[63:01.95]Forget about the fucking joke and kill the guys.
[63:04.99]Holy shit.
[63:06.11]Forget about it.
[63:12.90]I'll shoot the guy five times.
[63:14.34]Oh my god.
[63:19.98]No, no more... I gotta stop with this joke.
[63:22.72]No more fucking pretend jokes.
[63:28.36]These guys have a lot of money.
[63:38.20]Thank you, Moo.
[63:39.68]That was like an Old West version of Robocop opening.
[63:41.85]Also, George R. R. Martin dies at the end of the show.
[63:48.66]Okay, that's a that's okay.
[63:49.46]That's not that's like a timely like George RR Martin can't write his books in time joke Okay, that was an alright one stick with that one Well this is me like a dynamite now Stand back damn it here goes oh
[64:15.85]I wasn't standing that far back.
[64:16.95]We would have really been seriously injured.
[64:18.37]Shrapnel would have gone into my fucking collarbone.
[64:19.99]I would have been upset about it.
[64:21.43]I would have been like, ouch.
[64:35.91]Person in there?
[64:36.51]Alright, let's go.
[64:37.89]Alright, we rescued Snow White.
[64:40.51]From like the 700 dwarves that are in here.
[64:48.37]Oh, this is great.
[64:51.23]Okay, that's fantastic.
[64:53.45]You know, you can move.
[64:54.91]Look out, more of them.
[64:56.89]Yeah, you know, you're the one that should be looking out here.
[64:59.05]I'm gonna die because of this.
[65:00.60]Okay, that was fun.
[65:21.09]Thank God he moved.
[65:21.99]I don't want to do this whole thing again.
[65:25.45]Where are these guys?
[65:26.03]I don't see anybody.
[65:33.30]Oh, there they are.
[65:36.76]Almost.
[65:37.42]Almost got me.
[65:43.98]That's true.
[65:46.38]Didn't get me.
[65:54.88]I love the scroll field.
[65:55.84]It's fucking fantastic.
[65:58.70]It's definitely my favorite gun.
[66:04.90]I wrecked that sandbag.
[66:06.28]They did a number on that sandbag.
[66:14.52]Alright, now let's get her back safely.
[66:18.68]Okay.
[66:19.36]Looks like Carlos left us some horses.
[66:23.76]No, I'm not.
[66:24.26]That was not funny.
[66:27.06]You're not pulling out like your shitty Richard Nixon.
[66:29.28]Funny LOL.
[66:29.98]Look funny.
[66:30.62]Laugh out loud president.
[66:35.12]Should I take her or what?
[66:38.56]No, he's going to take her.
[66:40.88]Let's go before any more of them show up.
[66:43.49]Internet, come on.
[66:44.63]What is this shit?
[66:45.49]Don't do this.
[66:47.39]I'm looking over and I'm just seeing red right now.
[66:51.35]Oh, great.
[66:51.97]And I'm like, I'm looking at my fucking internet and shit.
[66:54.08]Like, I'm scared that I'm gonna die.
[66:56.74]Where are these people?
[66:58.54]What am I getting shot at by?
[67:01.08]Who?
[67:01.28]Where?
[67:02.92]I'm not aiming at you.
[67:03.68]I'm upset about my internet connection.
[67:07.40]It's okay.
[67:07.96]He's unkillable.
[67:09.22]He's just a fucking bullet sponge, so that's fine.
[67:11.08]Alright, let's go.
[67:23.57]That guy.
[67:27.04]Is that really the best way to carry this person?
[67:31.82]Probably not.
[67:33.36]Too much safer if she was actually sitting up on the horse.
[67:37.52]I hear coyotes.
[67:46.63]I'm going to dead-eye these last guys up here.
[67:55.18]Or ammo.
[67:58.88]I got his hat.
[68:01.50]Got his shoulder.
[68:02.46]And these guys up there.
[68:05.46]Still alive?
[68:12.98]Oh!
[68:13.70]Right in the head.
[68:15.06]I could do a couple of rock ramps with that one.
[68:23.99]This guy's proning over here, I swear.
[68:29.56]Got the birds though, that's the good part, got the birds.
[68:36.68]I'm gonna be fucking L-D-O-D-D-A-B-L-D-O-D-O-D-A-B-L-D-O-D-A-B-L-D-O-D-O-D-A-B-L-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D
[68:56.07]Hey, why don't you go join Diablo?
[68:57.99]Fucking L-D-O-D-D-I-A-B-L-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O.
[69:03.49]It's the fucking L-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O.
[69:04.65]When I come running in the fucking town.
[69:10.32]It's the fucking L-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O.
[69:18.62]I probably should wait for him, right?
[69:27.02]Come on.
[69:28.36]Nah, that's a callback joke.
[69:33.79]Let's see.
[69:35.41]I got that box.
[69:38.59]Wait for Carlos.
[69:39.35]Okay.
[69:41.23]Like, right here?
[69:41.73]Where?
[69:44.77]Where is he?
[69:45.11]Oh, okay.
[69:45.41]We're good.
[69:53.55]This is not an ambush, no.
[69:56.27]The game plays itself or it goes back on the shelf.
[70:00.66]I beat Dark Souls 3 and the DLC on stream.
[70:03.78]That game played itself.
[70:05.46]Have you beaten that game yet?
[70:20.64]You know, according to my achievements and my trophies and shit.
[70:24.36]Only like 0.2% of people have completed Dark Souls 3.
[70:28.31]So I am... Excuse me.
[70:34.61]And I did it on stream too.
[70:35.75]While I was like fucking eating.
[70:36.97]Remember that one?
[70:37.47]I was eating while we fought the dragon.
[70:43.15]75k.
[70:49.09]I had help.
[70:52.71]I'm sorry to say this, but I beat every single Dark Souls 3 boss.
[70:57.33]Besides the one dragon in the optional area.
[71:00.84]And one other boss by myself.
[71:03.72]And the other times I didn't, it was like a joke.
[71:07.00]We were making jokes about playing Mario Party.
[71:09.84]Come on.
[71:12.14]There he goes, bragging about Dark Souls again.
[71:32.93]What the fuck was this?
[71:35.77]I don't understand what just fucking happened.
[71:38.33]I just rode into a guy getting executed.
[71:41.89]And I got the- I got executed.
[71:44.01]I took his place.
[71:45.51]Only fucking life can pay for death.
[71:50.15]Other way around.
[71:50.65]Only death can pay for life.
[71:54.70]I don't know what the fuck was even going on.
[72:01.52]That same thing just happened to me.
[72:02.92]The same thing happened to me that was infuriating.
[72:06.18]The guy was hidden.
[72:07.00]How was I supposed to see that?
[72:07.98]Alright, we can go back to LR.
[72:16.35]We can keep doing LR.
[72:17.21]We can do D. Let's go to D. Let's do DeSanta.
[72:21.56]Let's go find DeSanta.
[72:24.22]I'm going to laugh so hard.
[72:25.26]This is literally just a Santa Claus.
[72:27.78]It's just Santa.
[72:41.13]Lots of crazy shit happening over here down in Mexico.
[72:46.60]Michael DeSanta.
[72:49.20]GTA 5.
[73:00.30]Why did I move here?
[73:01.20]I guess it was the weather.
[73:10.05]My favorite part about GTA V is when Michael screams.
[73:12.79]His scream is crazy.
[73:17.98]He's got, like, one of the best, like, screaming voices.
[73:28.55]Okay...
[73:33.47]No, I ain't doing it.
[73:34.73]I'm not doing it.
[73:36.27]I can't do it.
[73:37.55]I will get fucking angry again if I do this.
[73:40.35]I'm having, like, fun right now.
[73:43.53]I'm not gonna fucking get, like, angry and pissed off right now.
[73:47.01]That's what's gonna happen.
[73:49.23]It's not gonna be fun.
[73:50.34]I'm gonna get frustrated.
[73:51.52]150 bucks?
[73:53.88]Maybe.
[73:54.12]Because everyone's gonna, like, make fun of me and, like, how bad I am and shit.
[74:00.74]And, like, they don't know, like, the truth.
[74:04.79]Nobody knows the truth.
[74:14.58]Do it, dumb head.
[74:15.60]Hey!
[74:15.68]What the hell is this?
[74:24.44]I guess we're here.
[74:28.34]D. Just in time.
[74:32.16]Civilization at any price.
[74:34.28]What do you want, gringo?
[74:37.92]What are you doing here?
[74:40.56]Have you heard?
[74:41.40]There's a war going on.
[74:43.50]My name's John Marston.
[74:45.30]I've been sent here to retrieve a couple of men.
[74:47.48]Can I speak to your commander?
[74:52.25]You want to talk to my boss, gringo?
[74:55.81]I guess.
[74:57.55]Because I'm not good enough for you?
[75:00.13]No, sir.
[75:02.27]You think you're better than me?
[75:05.77]Thank you, William.
[75:11.49]Thank you, William Kangaroo.
[75:16.39]I'm glad you're enjoying the game.
[75:18.80]It's one of my favorite games.
[75:20.04]It's one of my only games I've 100%ed, and it's my top three of all time.
[75:25.18]It's very fun.
[75:28.10]Relax!
[75:28.80]I mean, relax!
[75:33.23]That was a really good drawn-eye laugh that that guy did.
[75:48.88]My name is Capitan Vicente de Santa.
[75:51.51]John Marston.
[75:53.13]John Constantino.
[75:53.91]My country is in pain, John Marston.
[75:57.73]Terrible pain.
[75:59.93]The rebels have seized the people by the throat and destroyed our way of life.
[76:04.36]I'm no politician, sir.
[76:07.39]And I am no soldier.
[76:09.85]A killer.
[76:12.29]But we're both beholding to wartime.
[76:15.78]The guy like really awkwardly and creepily leaned in and smiled in my face.
[76:19.56]I don't, like... If I was like at a restaurant or something.
[76:24.52]Like, we're at a restaurant right now.
[76:25.80]That's kind of weird, right?
[76:27.60]To keep our civilization alive.
[76:29.92]But it's tough.
[76:32.25]Let's see what he does.
[76:35.93]I'm going to do it again.
[76:37.12]He is doing it.
[76:38.84]He's doing it again.
[76:39.50]It breaks my heart.
[76:53.00]Did he just give a drink to the fucking umbrella?
[76:56.96]I wish I enjoy your freedom.
[76:58.87]He did.
[77:00.29]He poured me a drink, he poured him a drink, and then he poured a drink for the umbrella above us.
[77:05.01]Who was that for?
[77:06.79]I believe he came here to seek protection from another outlaw named Javier Escuela.
[77:11.42]You're no moralist, but you hunt outlaws?
[77:14.88]So it would seem.
[77:17.14]Heard anything of these men?
[77:18.60]I am the governor.
[77:19.46]That's odd.
[77:20.38]Or what is left of me.
[77:22.45]Allos seek each other.
[77:24.65]They're possibly hiding with thieves and killers who pose as freedom fighters in the hills around here.
[77:31.28]They're united under one traitor named Adam Reyes.
[77:35.76]Where could I find this Reyes?
[77:37.96]If I knew, I would be there, hunting him with everything that is true within me.
[77:43.69]Reyes finds you.
[77:45.15]Like cholera.
[77:49.17]Something like that.
[77:51.29]But it's possible though.
[77:53.53]My men are trying to lure him into a trap.
[77:57.75]Possibly, you could ride with us.
[78:01.55]And if everything goes okay, I'm sure the colonel will help you.
[78:06.67]It's a cool looking rifle.
[78:07.75]Is it weird that I want to shoot that rifle?
[78:12.80]I feel like that rifle's really really old school and like fun to shoot that like BADOOM and like aim at like a target or something.
[78:19.02]I want that rifle.
[78:20.12]How much are those?
[78:25.34]I want like a horse too.
[78:27.09]One of these horses.
[78:28.37]How much is like a horse?
[78:30.15]I sound like fucking Veruca right now by the way.
[78:33.35]I want it.
[78:34.13]How much is it daddy?
[78:37.19]It's not like singing.
[78:41.55]I want the world.
[78:43.76]I want the whole world.
[78:46.66]I want to lock it all up in my pocket.
[78:49.26]It's my bar of chocolate.
[78:51.66]Wait, wait, wait.
[78:52.38]We're still going?
[78:55.16]We're still going?
[79:00.74]You did not expect such a warm welcome from the Mexican army.
[79:04.86]I guess he's still coming.
[79:05.88]I didn't know what to expect.
[79:07.80]I hadn't even crossed the border and I was being shot at.
[79:10.42]You will hear a lot of words like tyrant and oppression here.
[79:14.65]Words that the peasants have been taught.
[79:16.77]I'm not shooting the other one.
[79:18.47]The army is suffering a crisis of repulation.
[79:23.39]What is wrong with you?
[79:24.29]A lot of things, I think.
[79:24.89]You have heard about the colonel down here.
[79:26.91]He's not famous for his compassion.
[79:28.81]This is the point.
[79:30.01]Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of the best movies ever.
[79:42.50]The remake was a fucking piece of shit.
[79:44.90]It's not far now.
[79:46.00]Are you ready?
[79:47.02]Ready for what?
[79:48.18]We will lure the rebels into a trap.
[79:50.39]There's a train leaving Chuparosa soon.
[79:53.23]Tim Burton, you know, oh, I... Tim, in quotes, look at how weird I am.
[79:58.59]My movies are so weird, end quotes, Tim Burton.
[80:01.79]Like, took the fucking Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and made it like his fucking Edward Scissorhands movie.
[80:07.88]Come on, the train is waiting.
[80:18.33]You cannot stop Gene Wilder.
[80:19.87]Gene Wilder is a fucking legend.
[80:23.53]How dare you remake that movie?
[80:25.51]Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka was perfect.
[80:27.69]I ain't gonna do this well.
[80:31.23]I'm gonna fuck this up.
[80:32.57]Just to let you guys know.
[80:41.40]Let's go!
[80:46.78]We gotta protect the train.
[80:47.68]It's kind of a loud train.
[80:55.07]I'm gonna get hit by the train.
[80:56.65]Guaranteed.
[80:56.97]Should I slow down a little here?
[81:04.13]What's going on?
[81:04.93]You can only go on the left side, so hopefully nobody's on the right side.
[81:19.11]Gene Wilder.
[81:21.03]If you've never seen any of Gene Wilder's actual comedies, do yourself a favor and watch them.
[81:27.15]Like some of the old Mel Brooks movies.
[81:38.24]Don't get hit by the train.
[81:44.84]Don't get- Jeremy!
[81:45.86]Don't get hit by the train.
[81:46.64]I'm trying out loud.
[82:07.20]Do not get hit by the train.
[82:11.18]Alright, so far so good.
[82:20.65]I need ammo in that thing.
[82:25.21]That guy had a grenade and it's gonna blow.
[82:28.18]Just be aware, don't go over there.
[82:35.83]Still got like 90% health, we're okay.
[82:37.13]Don't worry about it.
[82:38.55]I feel like we're getting through.
[82:44.79]I'm gonna cut these guys off.
[82:57.00]Whoo!
[82:58.00]Ooh!
[83:00.30]He's still alive?
[83:00.96]Surprised I didn't kill him.
[83:06.21]Now he's dead.
[83:06.87]Uh oh.
[83:07.83]Easy now.
[83:08.59]Don't get hit.
[83:14.28]Get outta here.
[83:19.42]Loaded.
[83:19.78]Do you remember the horse killer in 985?
[83:27.78]Do we have to go in the tunnel with this?
[83:39.28]This is a little tight.
[83:52.15]Get rid of that right now.
[84:01.76]Whoa!
[84:05.71]I'm gonna go around.
[84:07.87]Go around, go around.
[84:08.81]Come on.
[84:17.54]Keep moving.
[84:18.94]Keep moving, dude.
[84:19.82]One more guy behind.
[84:24.70]He hit the train, though.
[84:27.72]Where is he?
[84:32.21]OK, go.
[84:32.79]Go, go, go, go.
[84:33.41]You're dead!
[84:43.54]And... head.
[84:44.12]Where the fuck is this other guy?
[84:48.05]Where are they?
[84:48.61]Am I this blind?
[84:50.09]I can't be that blind.
[84:53.43]Come on!
[84:55.79]These dudes were lying down in the bushes?
[84:57.53]Really?
[85:03.54]I entered my Deadeye and they stood up.
[85:13.76]Not that blind.
[85:14.44]They were not visible.
[85:16.00]We did it.
[85:17.14]We went.
[85:19.18]Cool.
[85:19.72]Thank you, Stix Renegade, for the five bucks.
[85:42.73]I personally like the Johnny Depp one more.
[85:44.67]One of my favorite movies.
[85:45.81]Plus the songs will lit well sticks.
[85:48.33]I'm gonna have a little bit of a disagreement on that one.
[85:51.50]There was no... Did you see the fucking tunnel scene when they're in the boat?
[85:56.10]That can't be beat.
[85:56.60]That's one of the best scenes ever.
[86:00.24]Oh, shit.
[86:02.24]Pretty good Half-Life 1 sound.
[86:07.30]That's a big disagreement.
[86:08.04]Thank you also to Controlled Couchfire from Portals.
[86:11.88]You are a songbird of generations.
[86:35.61]I disagree.
[86:37.45]No, I get on my horse.
[86:39.85]What?
[86:40.09]Where's my horse?
[86:43.19]We're gonna re- now we have to retake the train.
[86:58.60]Get up!
[86:58.92]What am I paying you all for?
[87:00.84]You don't pay us at all!
[87:02.00]That's what I thought was gonna happen.
[87:13.52]Can I board the train?
[87:14.52]I feel like that'd make things a little easier.
[87:21.22]We got double-crossed, though.
[87:22.51]That's a bad one.
[87:26.45]Get alongside the front of the train and jump into the train.
[87:32.09]Go along the side... What?
[87:35.61]Go along to the front and jump into the train.
[87:41.68]I need to get, like... I'm not on a good spot right now.
[87:44.12]I can't, like, get any speed.
[87:45.02]There we go.
[87:51.50]Get me off the train and kill it.
[88:01.44]Am I gonna... Can I match this train speed?
[88:03.30]Am I gonna be going this fucking slow the whole time?
[88:07.14]Stop the train quickly, time is running out.
[88:08.70]Well, I can't go that fast!
[88:12.33]Jump into the train.
[88:13.43]Get to the front of the train and jump on the train.
[88:15.47]Sure.
[88:20.47]Okay, so jump onto the train.
[88:24.92]I did it.
[88:25.18]Now I gotta, like, pull the brakes, right?
[88:37.75]Damn it, CJ.
[88:47.40]By the way, I almost pressed triangle.
[88:49.98]I almost just jumped off the horse.
[88:53.19]But, I'm good.
[89:00.94]Trains are very well known for stopping quickly.
[89:03.24]50 bucks.
[89:06.69]Alright, I got some money.
[89:07.61]Let's go... We got lots of options here.
[89:17.11]L, D, or L. L, R. Luisa.
[89:22.68]Let's go back to Landon.
[89:24.78]Do I have Tuporosa on my...
[89:28.80]I think I have Chuparosa, right?
[89:30.34]I should be able to get out there and do it, right?
[89:39.61]El Dio de Diablo de Odio de los Muertos.
[89:43.37]Get your controllers right, smart streamer.
[89:45.31]No, I can't.
[89:46.43]I don't play Xbox.
[89:51.36]I want a different height.
[89:52.14]I want a different suit.
[89:56.14]Okay, I almost have this one.
[89:57.48]Win at the horseshoes.
[89:58.44]Win at horseshoes and search thieves landing.
[90:05.44]I mean, I have some of these.
[90:06.42]I'm putting this back on.
[90:14.42]I'm sick of looking like a fucking chump.
[90:19.34]Let's go to... Chuparosa.
[90:29.88]I'm putting the classy thing on.
[90:35.40]What's wrong?
[90:35.78]Why does everybody hate the wine guy so much?
[90:40.10]Let's go to the store.
[90:46.03]This guy's fucking strong.
[90:47.95]Alright, come on, get up.
[90:51.85]You can't climb this?
[90:52.61]Come on, I know you can.
[90:55.24]Climb it.
[90:56.88]I know you can do this, see?
[90:58.22]I knew it.
[91:06.63]Ooh, wants more money.
[91:07.91]Yep.
[91:08.33]Okay, this is that guy.
[91:11.01]This guy gives a lot of money.
[91:12.13]It was 50 bucks last time.
[91:13.09]We're doing it again.
[91:14.57]We're not talking about, like, fucking freaks and geeks and strangers and, like, tweaks.
[91:18.28]Like, this guy is the guy that I like the most because he gives the most money.
[91:20.84]Get that bandana on.
[91:37.59]Steal the wagon.
[91:38.31]It's always like $55.
[91:38.99]What do they got this time?
[91:41.07]Same thing.
[91:41.53]It's alright.
[91:41.87]I need to get out of here!
[92:04.71]No, he had to be coming right down this road, didn't he?
[92:07.55]Is this road?
[92:08.01]Is this road?
[92:08.49]Is this road?
[92:08.85]Is this a road?
[92:09.38]Is this a road?
[92:10.00]Is this a road?
[92:15.70]It's a road.
[92:19.86]That is the worst possible time for me to come over here.
[92:25.53]All kinds of fucking bumps and cruises.
[92:27.65]Holy shit.
[92:28.81]We're okay.
[92:29.19]I have this one guy.
[92:31.59]Should I kill this guy?
[92:32.97]I kinda have to.
[92:39.16]I have to get rid of this guy.
[92:40.28]I do.
[92:40.60]I don't even know where we're going.
[92:44.27]This is not the right way.
[92:46.93]This ain't gonna be correct.
[92:54.37]Fuck off.
[92:59.92]Why is my bounty not going down?
[93:01.34]Why is the wanted thing not going down?
[93:10.78]Yep.
[93:12.64]Put her into four-wheel drive.
[93:13.86]You'll be out of there in no time.
[93:18.74]What?
[93:19.08]What?
[93:29.12]Where's Burnout?
[93:30.22]Oh shit.
[93:31.58]Easy.
[93:34.56]I gotta get back on the road.
[93:38.21]am I putting the horses in reverse yeah kinda alright we're back on the road get our money I have a pardon letter too don't I still so it don't matter
[94:06.20]I like this little walkway, though.
[94:07.54]I like this road.
[94:08.28]It's a good road.
[94:10.20]He is the left.
[94:17.86]Down.
[94:18.60]There he is.
[94:22.42]Pardon the letter for the U.S.
[94:25.60]Is that how that works?
[94:26.48]Really?
[94:27.36]I can't use that here?
[94:29.88]Interesting.
[94:32.63]By the way, look at my character right now.
[94:34.29]He's not really moving.
[94:36.31]I don't have any animation.
[94:44.31]62 bucks.
[94:46.87]That guy seriously is loaded.
[94:50.59]I love it.
[94:55.79]I will come see you again.
[94:56.59]You pay more than fucking major story missions.
[95:09.84]Okay, let's go here.
[95:11.40]Let's go back to... Wait, where did I go?
[95:16.25]I gotta take the bandana off, don't I?
[95:23.55]I need to go get, like, some stuff.
[95:32.04]I wouldn't need to steal off-branded Frost and Flakes if I just looted more corpses.
[95:39.27]Bounty over here?
[95:42.95]I want to do some exploring in this town.
[95:44.65]There's like a store.
[95:45.77]Is there a weapons dealer in here?
[95:47.55]Because I have money.
[95:50.41]I may as well spend some of it, right?
[95:54.86]This is the fucking barbecue guy?
[95:57.64]Look at that.
[95:57.92]He's got a fucking nice rib there.
[95:59.02]Nice fucking spare rib.
[96:01.50]He's just tenderizing to make sure it's nice and tender.
[96:05.50]Look at the fucking smoke.
[96:06.34]Look at this fucking smoker.
[96:07.26]That's a sick smoker.
[96:11.60]Now what do you got?
[96:13.73]Survivalist map, uh... Hmm, revolver ammo, snake oil... A lot of random shit here.
[96:21.77]What can I sell?
[96:22.39]Crow feathers?
[96:23.53]Get these out of here.
[96:24.55]Yes, tenderizing bone.
[96:26.13]Hey, Doc!
[96:46.35]I guess there is no arms dealer here.
[96:48.81]Probably have to go to a different town for that.
[96:52.85]You can make that jump.
[96:55.71]Lucky in love.
[96:59.01]Lucky in love.
[97:09.87]Thank you.
[97:10.67]Oh, yeah.
[97:12.55]Hey, Mr. Marston.
[97:13.95]How you keeping, sir?
[97:14.99]Just fine, thank you.
[97:16.03]And you?
[97:16.99]Very well, sir.
[97:18.61]Thank God my wife died.
[97:20.02]Thank God my wife died.
[97:22.86]That's pretty morbid.
[97:27.46]Keep playing, Mr. Ricketts.
[97:30.16]Oh, I'm sorry, Herr Muller.
[97:32.46]I'll keep playing you in servitude for the rest of your life on Earth, if that makes you happy.
[97:37.26]Yes, I shall indeed, sir.
[97:40.56]A lot of cards.
[97:45.10]Oh, do I have to beat somebody in poker?
[97:47.40]I don't know how to play poker very well.
[97:51.69]This guy's got a gold tooth.
[98:00.31]No, I have to win in poker.
[98:01.67]A hundred bucks!
[98:05.21]Oh, no.
[98:05.77]I don't know how to play poker.
[98:14.71]Just give me pocket aces and let me win.
[98:19.23]I don't know how to play poker.
[98:22.83]I really don't.
[98:23.72]The first time I sat down it was a joke.
[98:24.92]I don't know how to play.
[98:29.64]A7.
[98:29.80]I don't know.
[98:30.36]Call.
[98:34.07]Please let me just win money.
[98:34.93]I won money.
[98:35.35]I did.
[98:35.53]Good.
[98:35.65]I win.
[98:35.89]Now what do I do?
[98:47.61]I think it's about time I showed you fine fellas how this is done.
[98:52.05]Ace high.
[98:52.69]No, thank you.
[98:55.78]Everybody folds.
[98:56.38]I win.
[98:56.62]That's that easy, guys.
[99:02.46]Everybody who sits at the table has to fold two times in a row.
[99:04.68]You fucking cheat.
[99:07.19]Excuse me?
[99:07.83]You fucking looked in my fucking cards, you fucking cheat.
[99:11.66]Now, Herr Muller, let's calm down.
[99:13.66]There must be some mistake.
[99:15.68]There's no mistake.
[99:16.66]Your Yankee friend here is a fucking cheat.
[99:19.38]Easy there, Germany.
[99:20.42]Calm yourself down.
[99:21.64]Pay that man his money.
[99:24.63]Check, check, check.
[99:25.47]I know exactly what I did.
[99:26.63]No, no, he beat me straight up.
[99:28.79]I'd prefer it if we could all play a friendly game and never get hurt.
[99:32.47]You, you planted this guy Ricketts.
[99:34.69]Now, why would I do that?
[99:36.59]I've already beaten you.
[99:37.87]Now calm down and let's finish the game.
[99:40.29]No more cards game.
[99:42.27]Ease up there, friend.
[99:43.35]Uh-oh, who's going to fire first?
[99:44.49]That guy stood up with a bottle of, like, booze.
[99:47.61]I'm involved, too.
[99:48.53]Yeah, I was having a drink with my wife, but I'm involved.
[99:53.90]An impasse, sir.
[99:55.36]An impasse.
[99:57.34]We could all die here and now.
[100:03.01]Who is even on whose side?
[100:04.07]I don't even know.
[100:24.62]Too many guns pointed at people.
[100:26.04]Like, who's... Where their loyalties even stand?
[100:28.78]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[100:29.58]My guy was pointing at me.
[100:31.52]That fucking guy, Lando, was pointing the gun at me.
[100:34.81]What?
[100:35.17]Did he change his mind halfway through?
[100:41.83]A duel is all about timing.
[100:43.85]If you pull your gun too soon, you'll be less accurate.
[100:47.23]I don't even know how to do duels.
[100:48.21]I just have to aim or something.
[100:49.67]I don't even know.
[100:51.14]I don't know how to duel.
[100:52.76]I like fucking skipped the tutorial.
[100:54.98]I should have been ahead.
[100:56.62]Is it like right bumper and X or right trigger?
[100:58.70]I don't understand.
[101:15.37]I just don't understand how this works.
[101:28.42]I don't fucking get it.
[101:29.32]I literally pressed every single button.
[101:35.38]I pressed every single fucking button.
[101:37.77]All of them.
[101:38.91]It didn't do anything.
[101:40.59]Nobody steals from me, especially an American.
[101:44.45]I hit A, X, right trigger.
[101:45.99]It doesn't matter.
[101:46.45]I don't know.
[101:46.75]I don't get it.
[101:47.29]I'm shooting this guy in the fucking head.
[102:04.36]That's it, right?
[102:04.86]Shoot.
[102:05.30]Like, shoot.
[102:08.14]I still don't understand how this works.
[102:09.92]Holy shit, that guy's a science experiment now.
[102:12.04]Your health.
[102:25.52]Well, you're bad at poker.
[102:26.86]We're doing this again.
[102:27.66]Alright.
[102:27.96]Take out the stranger without killing the hostage, sure.
[102:31.34]Is the same thing gonna happen here?
[102:32.64]Oh, Dios mio.
[102:55.89]Wait, is he holding a gun too?
[102:59.53]Oh, got him.
[103:09.27]She's dead 100%?
[103:09.73]Uh, no, she's not.
[103:12.70]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[103:16.16]Make sure you shoot the door.
[103:22.36]Make sure you shoot that, like, fucking fountain too.
[103:32.93]I guess we can say this poker game is over because that's coming up well I must say you tourists certainly bring peace and prosperity abcd efg that's beginning of the alphabet I doubt muller will be missed wasn't much of a poker player
[103:54.21]50 bucks.
[103:54.49]Cool.
[103:56.79]We got a stranger over here.
[103:58.36]Let me loot these dudes.
[104:03.70]Grover.
[104:09.20]Auto-aim is OP.
[104:10.56]I mean, it kind of is.
[104:16.57]And again, you know, I'm not going to complain about it, am I?
[104:29.94]The whole point was you're going to get a refund.
[104:31.30]I mean, wasn't it $25?
[104:32.68]It was $25, right?
[104:33.14]I won twice, so it's $50.
[104:33.86]How much is this?
[104:36.06]$200.
[104:36.08]Should I buy this house?
[104:38.78]Should I drop $200 right now and buy this?
[104:59.64]What do you think?
[105:04.83]Let's do it.
[105:05.23]Let's buy this.
[105:06.21]Mexican poncho menu entry complete.
[105:12.35]Really?
[105:12.61]So now I get a poncho?
[105:16.38]What is in here?
[105:18.70]Revolver ammo.
[105:22.68]Rifle ammo.
[105:23.86]What else is in there?
[105:24.72]Shotgun ammo.
[105:36.53]There it is.
[105:36.91]It's like an astronaut.
[105:43.95]Alright, let's change it.
[105:46.13]Hey, look at that.
[105:47.39]Now I'm a real... I'm a real Rootin' Tootin' McCree.
[105:50.99]Let's save again.
[105:56.18]Save, please.
[105:59.86]Save, please.
[106:03.77]Now he looks good.
[106:05.61]I do look good.
[106:12.47]Mm-hmm.
[106:13.79]Mm-hmm.
[106:17.92]LR again?
[106:18.66]Is it too late to go to LR?
[106:20.76]Let's try it.
[106:22.24]Hasta luego.
[106:23.60]Hasta luego.
[106:24.72]Hello.
[106:27.20]Mexican wagon train.
[106:28.42]Here comes a big bull.
[106:30.50]Hey, gringo.
[106:33.21]Mr. Ricketts, come on in.
[106:35.71]Sit down and have yourself a drink.
[106:38.21]Sure.
[106:40.85]Say, any word of Javier Escuela?
[106:43.85]The man has no name.
[106:45.65]No, hasn't yet.
[106:47.85]Say, why are you after him anyway?
[106:51.32]We're old friends.
[106:52.94]We're old wagon friends.
[106:54.30]Educated together.
[106:56.84]So what is this, some kind of high school reunion sort of thing?
[106:59.84]Something like that.
[107:04.99]Well, you killed people.
[107:07.36]You lived a life.
[107:08.02]I wonder what scent those candles are.
[107:09.68]Fucking definitely apple on the right and like summer's breeze in the middle.
[107:14.34]I mean, I don't know.
[107:17.16]I tried to go straight.
[107:18.74]I did.
[107:19.96]I left the gang after the gang left me.
[107:22.85]Left me to die after I'd been shot.
[107:26.65]They'd all gone crazy anyhow.
[107:28.93]Our old leader?
[107:30.13]Fellow you probably heard of.
[107:32.11]Anyway, he more or less lost his mind, went and shot a bunch of people unfair like.
[107:38.02]I got shot in a robbery.
[107:39.82]Two in a factory robbery.
[107:41.34]I left them.
[107:44.82]That's how it goes.
[107:47.32]Yeah.
[107:48.82]Nice work.
[107:50.08]Nice story.
[107:51.78]Already had me a woman.
[107:54.03]Got me a farm.
[107:56.01]Then I got me more trouble.
[107:57.39]Sure.
[108:00.87]That's like a goofy impression.
[108:02.25]I used to run with.
[108:03.97]Fucking good Disney impression, dude.
[108:06.65]Well, if you don't, someone else will.
[108:09.63]There's no escape.
[108:12.15]Look at me.
[108:12.69]I spent 25 years killing men.
[108:16.37]Look at me now.
[108:17.71]Sitting around here like some low-rent would-be messiah.
[108:22.48]We're relics.
[108:24.74]Come on, have yourself another drink and let's wallow in a little self-pity.
[108:30.36]Sounds like a plan.
[108:31.08]Okay.
[108:31.66]Self-pity.
[108:32.46]Here we go.
[108:32.88]To your health.
[108:33.24]Mr. Ricketts.
[108:34.48]Mr. Ricketts.
[108:35.66]Thank the Lord I have found you.
[108:37.31]And you, Mr. Marsden.
[108:38.29]Will you sit down?
[108:40.31]Something bad's happening.
[108:42.01]I'm well, sir.
[108:43.23]But Allende is sending more men to the death.
[108:45.87]Prisoners who have not been tried.
[108:48.76]a prominent writer castilla and the local official whose only crime was not putting the small holders on the street when they were late with taxes writers and government officials for once I agree with the Hyundai some men need to be killed Mr. ricketts I was just joking where are they let's hang up our self-pity and go shoot ourselves some bad guys you're gonna be all
[109:15.78]Watching this is painful.
[109:16.72]Red Dead Redemption 2 is too far.
[109:19.78]Hey, just be happy that it's like coming out at all.
[109:22.85]You know what I mean?
[109:24.31]Be happy that it's actually going to be a thing.
[109:26.55]You know, like almost 10 years later.
[109:28.63]Alright, company landed.
[109:29.27]Let's do it.
[109:45.73]Oh, Jiminy Ricketts.
[109:47.07]What's the release date for Ender?
[109:48.49]Isn't it... It was supposed to be this year, right, when they pushed it back?
[109:52.82]What if it gets canceled?
[109:54.14]There's no way they're gonna cancel that game.
[110:04.71]They've probably been working on Red Dead Redemption 2 since maybe a year after this game came out.
[110:09.17]I have to find these two men.
[110:10.57]With respect, how I do it is no concern of yours.
[110:14.03]Choose your tone wisely, partner.
[110:15.91]Remember who you're talking to.
[110:17.61]How could I ever forget?
[110:18.73]And who are you, John Marston?
[110:20.35]Apart from a rat feeding every other hand he can find, my name means something.
[110:24.59]All you've done is kill a few peasants.
[110:26.63]And the only real outlaw you've taken on dropped you like a bad habit.
[110:30.33]Now, I politely ask you to watch your tone, Rick.
[110:33.25]All I'm saying is, maybe there's a reason why people around here don't want to talk.
[110:40.66]You must miss your family.
[110:42.12]It's the only thing that keeps me going.
[110:44.16]You know, you remind me a lot of myself.
[110:46.84]That's going to be huge.
[110:48.46]Stubborn and angry.
[110:49.94]If this game is as interesting and as open as it is, with this much to do back in 2010... It's an army convoy.
[110:57.38]I think I see the prisoners in those wagons.
[111:02.00]Was I not supposed to do that?
[111:06.49]Oh, I think I was.
[111:08.07]I gotta take control of the wagon.
[111:10.55]The wagon?
[111:11.95]I don't understand this.
[111:28.92]Dude, can you kill, like, what the fuck?
[111:31.76]Can you kill the guy that... Why did he just run by that guy?
[111:36.78]What the fuck was that?
[111:37.68]You know, I'm just gonna run by all the enemies.
[111:43.21]Make sure you do everything.
[111:44.79]Yeah, okay.
[111:45.53]Okay.
[111:58.33]Why is the shotgun out?
[111:59.91]Who the fuck did this?
[112:01.43]I didn't do that.
[112:03.01]I didn't have the fucking shotgun equipped.
[112:08.46]What?
[112:12.30]Why did that happen?
[112:13.28]What do you mean it got wrecked?
[112:16.91]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[112:21.70]I shot the guy and the thing is wrecked.
[112:23.68]Pretty sure, make sure you have the shotgun turned on.
[112:32.11]Like seriously, like I'm gonna fucking scream.
[112:43.73]These guys aren't even dead.
[112:48.82]It's like left bumper, right bumper bullshit.
[112:50.86]Like left trigger, right bumper.
[112:52.89]Give me a fucking PC.
[112:53.93]Give me a mouse and keyboard for Christ's sake.
[112:57.33]This shit makes me want to fucking rip my fucking head off.
[113:02.69]Give me a mouse and keyboard.
[113:04.51]Fuck playing with a controller.
[113:11.28]And I have the shotgun out again.
[113:15.28]Why do I have a shotgun in my hand?
[113:16.40]Break.
[113:16.54]Wait, didn't it just tell me to take control of the fucking wagon?
[114:03.95]Seriously.
[114:04.89]Dude, you know what?
[114:05.49]I don't care.
[114:06.23]It's like holding left trigger, pressing right stick and hitting like right bumper.
[114:11.55]It's like scratching my ass and like picking my nose.
[114:17.52]Give me a fucking mouse, for God's sakes.
[114:23.89]You know how much easier that would be to like press like fucking Q and aim with the mouse?
[114:50.21]No, I don't play, I don't, I barely play console games.
[114:54.49]I'm gonna make this complaint a thousand times.
[114:59.08]All of my, like, muscle memory is not with the controller.
[115:03.54]This is so foreign to me.
[115:06.42]I had to take this left.
[115:08.91]Whoa, the light.
[115:25.87]Ooh!
[115:27.03]Just fucking run him over, who cares?
[115:28.65]They're throwing... They're throwing glass!
[115:31.89]They're throwing glass bottles!
[115:33.55]They're throwing glass!
[115:39.04]What's going on?
[115:46.30]Who's that?
[115:49.38]Put your gun down, friend!
[115:56.74]Go!
[115:57.20]Just go!
[116:00.72]How are these guys still alive?
[116:04.40]I don't know.
[116:04.80]Fucking controllers, man.
[116:24.85]I can't do it.
[116:28.41]I love this game.
[116:29.83]This game is fucking a ton of fun.
[116:32.50]Give me a mouse.
[116:34.62]Let me hold down right click and shoot with left click, please.
[116:42.06]Why is the screen title in email?
[116:50.43]Because we're playing Red Dead for like a third stream in a row.
[116:55.23]So we're like replying to each other and like I'm like forwarding the stream.
[116:59.35]It's like pretty much we're doing another Red Dead stream.
[117:01.89]I think you blew for the two bucks.
[117:06.05]They just say PJ Salt.
[117:06.95]Yeah, sometime.
[117:22.75]Alright.
[117:28.43]Let's see the map.
[117:29.15]Let's see.
[117:30.15]We got... Can we do D or L?
[117:34.30]Let's go to L. Let's just ride.
[117:38.10]Let's do the scenic route.
[117:47.23]So long, Mr. Ricket.
[118:02.09]Okay, give me a little bit of credit here.
[118:05.67]Somebody, you guys have to give me at least a hair of credit.
[118:09.31]Have I once complained about this game?
[118:13.83]I have not.
[118:14.69]I have not said anything bad about Red Dead Redemption at all.
[118:17.65]I've just had complaints about the system in which it is controlled.
[118:21.43]That's it.
[118:21.69]It's a fucking fantastic game.
[118:25.27]I just have an issue with the system.
[118:26.92]I have not complained about Red Dead.
[118:29.08]The game is fantastic.
[118:31.24]I've talked about the systems in place.
[118:33.94]The video game systems in place that require me to use the controller.
[118:37.83]And an Xbox controller.
[118:38.91]That's all I've said.
[118:50.91]Those are complaints.
[118:52.53]No.
[118:53.25]No, they're not.
[118:55.47]They're technical complaints.
[118:59.78]Not even technical.
[119:00.38]The game runs fine.
[119:06.04]Look, it's alright.
[119:06.80]We're good.
[119:07.28]Everyone's doing fine.
[119:08.58]Sometimes you get a little heated.
[119:09.56]I'm back between 5 a.m.
[119:12.68]and 2 p.m.
[119:14.16]Well... Okay.
[119:16.54]Can I sleep in your outhouse?
[119:22.32]Can I go, like, diggin' in your outhouse?
[119:27.70]Oh, what the fuck am I?
[119:28.42]That's disgusting.
[119:29.10]What am I talking about?
[119:29.80]Is she in there?
[119:30.76]Hey, I need to talk to you now.
[119:37.22]I need to do this mission right now.
[119:39.90]Wake up.
[119:45.56]There's nobody in here.
[119:46.56]Open... Open what?
[119:49.42]Am I, like, stealing her clothes?
[119:54.28]What am I doing?
[120:00.32]Well, there's still five dollars out of her underwear drawer.
[120:02.86]Okay.
[120:03.14]Can I just, like, sleep in her bed?
[120:13.51]Oh, there's a guy here.
[120:15.41]Getting chased by dogs.
[120:16.45]Alright, you're safe.
[120:17.57]Now pay me money.
[120:30.78]I can't.
[120:34.92]Five bucks.
[120:40.66]Only five dollars.
[120:46.93]Let the dogs win.
[120:47.81]Well, I need to sell them.
[120:51.99]I've never seen what that does, by the way.
[120:53.33]I've never seen what happens when you shoot
[120:57.52]What are you talking about?
[121:08.63]The voice says this is nasty while he's still doing it.
[121:13.27]You stink.
[121:20.01]Why are all of John Marston's insults so tame?
[121:28.68]Alright, well, let's just advance time.
[121:29.74]Let me just go to bed.
[121:30.78]Can I do it out here?
[121:32.60]I don't think I can be on a road, can I?
[121:37.45]I guess I can.
[121:38.05]Let's just advance some time.
[121:54.49]I should use my treasure map.
[121:56.39]Yeah, I really should.
[121:58.37]I should do a lot of things, actually.
[122:06.09]Okay.
[122:09.31]What?
[122:11.13]Why am I this far away?
[122:14.43]Did somebody pick me up in my sleep and move me all the way over here?
[122:19.74]And move my campfire?
[122:22.32]It was right there.
[122:23.56]Alright.
[122:28.99]Here we go.
[122:29.45]Somebody pranked me.
[122:34.83]Why does everybody keep saying censor?
[122:37.11]There's nothing to censor.
[122:38.77]What's happening?
[122:54.04]great and terrible things.
[122:55.44]The revolution is coming.
[122:56.76]The country will be in turmoil once more.
[122:58.37]This time, we hope, is the last time.
[123:00.91]Does that seem likely?
[123:03.11]With Abraham Reyes, anything is possible.
[123:06.91]Where's your family going?
[123:08.29]My parents and my brother are headed to the hills.
[123:11.03]My sister has to flee.
[123:12.75]The army have an unfortunate way of treating women.
[123:15.80]And you?
[123:16.92]Don't worry about me, Mr. Marston.
[123:18.90]I'm living in history.
[123:20.28]I'm not afraid to die.
[123:22.32]Your nobility is almost as affecting as your naivete.
[123:25.74]I would rather be dead than a cynic like you, Mr. Marston.
[123:29.59]What do?
[123:30.95]I know you're not really like that.
[123:32.49]You saved me.
[123:33.93]Luisa, who's going to save me?
[123:37.34]I'm watching the sensor wiggle in the corner.
[123:39.18]Still there.
[123:39.64]I got it ready.
[123:40.36]I'm always prepared for a sensor.
[123:41.51]You do know that, right?
[124:05.75]Put an orange tip on that gun, so it's dangerous.
[124:09.23]So it's a fake one?
[124:14.81]Let's go.
[124:17.31]Oh, okay.
[124:17.85]Drivers.
[124:18.41]I'm gonna just... We don't have time.
[124:23.81]You're right.
[124:24.19]I'm gonna go really fast.
[124:26.99]In the dark before sundown.
[124:29.03]Oh, Jesus.
[124:30.07]Okay.
[124:30.41]Well, we gotta go.
[124:39.09]This is just, like, arbitrary, right?
[124:40.93]It's not like it's going to take that long.
[124:45.03]No, you can't.
[124:45.49]No, don't stop me.
[124:46.23]We've got to deliver a package.
[124:53.04]What do they want now?
[124:55.62]Act normal.
[124:56.44]Act normal.
[124:57.58]It's nothing to worry about.
[124:58.82]We can't just plow through them.
[125:01.20]What?
[125:01.40]What?
[125:12.23]We don't got time for that.
[125:13.11]Is that an army checkpoint?
[125:14.45]What is that wagon doing?
[125:16.21]What is it, roadblock?
[125:17.91]Take the left, Steve.
[125:19.45]Stay away from it.
[125:20.99]What is it, just blowing up?
[125:23.35]Oh, my God.
[125:23.73]Oh, my God.
[125:24.41]Did you see that?
[125:25.75]Keep going.
[125:26.59]Faster, señor.
[125:36.92]We're good.
[125:37.88]Don't worry.
[125:38.68]We'll make it
[126:05.30]He's driving right through people.
[126:07.08]It's not a big deal.
[126:10.14]Keep going!
[126:10.70]We can make it!
[126:11.50]Go!
[126:14.09]I still got native.

[126:24.89]Go!
[126:25.03]Go!
[126:41.89]I had to see... I just had to see what was gonna happen.
[126:46.44]I did that for fun.
[126:47.52]I wanted to see, like, if I could go over the tracks.
[126:58.05]He crashed over me.
[126:58.87]I just wanted to see if that was possible.
[127:05.75]You don't have to be, like, every mission first try.
[127:08.04]Like, I'm just trying to have some, like, fun.
[127:11.85]How dare you like just fuck around in like a open world video game.
[127:15.78]Do the mission exactly how you're supposed to do it immediately and don't ever do anything else.
[127:24.28]You're not allowed to do anything.
[127:26.01]All you're allowed to do is do exactly what you're supposed to.
[127:32.09]You guys sound like my fucking English teacher right now.
[127:47.59]I will show you the way we must be careful to avoid the army or they will kill us both what kind of English teacher is that look senor more soldiers I can't shoot what what can I know I can't take my gun okay well I can't take off my gun I was trying to like just bread that those guys

[128:31.29]Hurry!
[128:33.97]We have to get to the door!
[128:39.46]We're going to lead up straight to the door!
[128:48.11]I was trying to take the pole to the right.
[128:49.81]God damn it.
[128:50.69]Nice.
[128:52.86]Yeah, nice.
[128:53.70]Too big.
[129:01.08]I wasn't trying to have fun there.
[129:02.22]I got, like, stuck.
[129:04.38]No, get the fuck in here.
[129:08.80]Wait, why can't I take the gun?
[129:09.50]I can take the gun now.
[129:10.34]Why?
[129:12.69]Why couldn't I take the gun up before?
[129:21.40]laughing about it.
[129:22.10]Whatever, that was... Why can't I take my... I couldn't take the gun out before.
[129:25.54]That doesn't make any sense.
[129:26.60]I couldn't hold left trigger before.
[129:31.03]Oh, no.
[129:31.39]Now I can't.
[129:31.91]Okay.
[129:33.77]I actually can.
[129:35.95]I actually can take the gun out.
[129:50.31]Don't you fucking go.
[129:57.66]She's getting lit the fuck up right now.
[129:59.30]Stagecoach is so fucking sloppy.
[130:01.48]It really is.
[130:20.17]Like, the horses move, then you move.
[130:21.85]It's really hard.
[130:30.34]Oh my god, this fucking update.
[130:36.04]This keeps fucking me up every time.
[130:37.88]Every single time I do that.
[130:39.76]God damn it!
[130:40.84]Don't you dare!
[130:52.39]We have to lose them!
[131:01.30]They're going to follow us to the top!
[131:08.54]Go!
[131:08.78]Go!
[131:09.14]Go!
[131:09.28]Go!
[131:09.66]Go!
[131:11.61]Why is the shotgun equipped?
[131:13.03]I don't understand this.
[131:14.69]Why does it keep defaulting me to the fucking shotgun?
[131:31.58]Where are you taking me, lady?
[131:36.67]I can bend it around these bends!
[131:54.66]Let me go right.
[131:57.82]Down here?
[132:17.69]Like that guy could have just been like a merchant for all I know.
[132:20.09]What are you talking about?
[132:32.54]Just go!
[132:33.58]Get out of this fucking wagon!
[132:39.99]I didn't like this mission at all.
[132:41.39]Fuck this mission.
[132:42.75]First try.
[132:43.23]Complaining about... No, that wasn't a complaint about the game.
[132:47.33]No, it wasn't.
[132:48.99]That's not true.
[132:50.69]That's not true.
[133:12.29]I got a lot of honor.
[133:13.23]I need to do some disarmable things to even this out, don't I?
[133:23.83]Why do I have a bed here?
[133:28.12]What the fuck are you doing, dog?
[133:30.38]What the hell?
[133:32.66]Get out of here.
[133:34.66]What are you over here for?
[133:36.28]Whose dog are you?
[133:39.26]Don't fucking make me do this.
[133:42.41]Get out of here.
[133:44.19]Get out of here!
[133:50.63]No, seriously, get the fuck away from me.
[133:53.23]Fine, he finally listened to me.
[133:56.51]Save the game.
[133:58.63]Now I hear gunshots.
[133:59.51]I think he's going after the dog.
[134:07.83]Alright.
[134:11.48]He's having trouble over there.
[134:17.51]A pack is going to come get me, I know, right?
[134:24.66]I'm going to save it again.
[134:27.52]Where do I want to go?
[134:28.14]I want to go back to L. I'm right next to D. I'm right next to Santa.
[134:31.46]Let's just go there.
[134:31.96]I'm going to just get to Dawn.
[134:35.04]I got to pee too, though.
[134:36.77]Give me one minute, guys.
[134:37.53]I'm going to take a pee break.
[134:39.01]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[134:41.27]Go get a snack or go take a piss.
[134:42.69]Go do whatever you need to.
[136:26.14]Thank you.
[137:22.51]Okay, here we go.
[137:23.23]Let's get back to it.
[137:26.01]Welcome back, everybody.
[137:27.16]Uh, did I do this already?
[137:30.96]No.
[137:31.34]I think I'm okay, though.
[137:32.64]I think we're at... Are we at dawn yet?
[137:37.44]What is it?
[137:38.00]It's 5 a.m.?
[137:38.70]It's probably... I'll be... It'll... Let's just go.
[137:42.74]I can... I'll be... I'll be... I did... Can I speak, please?
[137:49.51]Now this is fucking beautiful.
[137:50.75]This is absolutely gorgeous.
[137:55.12]When you're coming up to like dawn.
[138:01.63]That's like a painting.
[138:02.49]The P sounded unhealthy.
[138:15.43]Well, it was pretty healthy actually.
[138:22.33]Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.
[138:29.05]I just, like, rammed them.
[138:31.19]If this horse was a goat, they would be in big trouble.
[138:38.94]Stagecoach.
[138:40.26]Alright.
[138:42.81]Five-finger fillet.
[138:43.93]I ain't doing that.
[138:54.86]And there's the property for sale.
[138:57.44]I don't want to go buy no gun.
[138:58.52]Alright, after this mission, we're going to go buy some stuff.
[139:00.84]Because I have a lot of old shit.
[139:05.86]Besides the skull field.
[139:18.51]7am and 10pm.
[139:19.45]Alright, well, come on.
[139:22.24]Don't make me wait.
[139:25.05]You gotta make me wait.
[139:25.87]I really thought it was gonna be like morning by the time I got here.
[139:29.29]Let's just go steal shit then.
[139:32.51]I don't think I can.
[139:37.88]Alright.
[139:45.56]Who is just blood-curdlingly screaming?
[139:51.14]Some lady is just belting out right now.
[139:54.18]Where?
[139:58.70]Alright, what?
[140:08.07]Is there a weapons deal?
[140:08.89]Maybe I'll just do that now.
[140:09.83]Is there a weapons deal here?
[140:10.83]Like in this town somewhere?
[140:13.21]Or do I have to go to the other town?
[140:21.52]Me and my horse would like to leave.
[140:35.32]Okay, where is there somebody I can buy shit from?
[140:42.04]What is this?
[140:42.62]What's happening right here?
[140:55.07]What's in there?
[140:56.73]Oh, it's an execution!
[140:58.91]Holy shit.
[140:59.57]Okay, can I watch from like a different spot?
[141:08.10]You can see me.
[141:08.70]Come on.
[141:09.02]Alright, that's it.
[141:13.39]They executed him.
[141:14.61]She got out.
[141:18.83]Jesus.
[141:24.98]Wow, the AI really is programmed.
[141:26.94]Can I loot the bodies?
[141:28.56]Oh, I can.
[141:29.18]Is she looting the bodies?
[141:32.78]Did your husband have any money?
[141:39.27]Can I pick her up or something?
[141:45.93]Whatever.
[141:46.47]Thanks for the money.
[141:51.24]Cool.
[141:51.68]Okay.
[141:56.12]This is a town full of terror.
[141:57.84]I'm not sure if you can turn off loot animations.
[142:06.65]Send her to her husband.
[142:07.77]No, that's evil.
[142:10.19]There is no gunsmith, like, here, then.
[142:12.69]Is he, like, in the house?
[142:18.72]Shop's open soon.
[142:19.96]Where'd they open?
[142:20.68]Are they, like, up here or down there?
[142:22.18]Because I don't see anything.
[142:27.38]Probably, like, getting to be that time, though.
[142:37.17]Where's the censor?
[142:37.77]I don't know.
[142:38.71]Not ready yet.
[142:41.89]There we go.
[142:42.15]Well, I'll just do this.
[142:42.91]I can go in the house.
[142:50.76]The demon drink.
[142:51.58]Okay.
[142:52.22]One of the houses down.
[142:54.50]Okay.
[143:07.14]Obviously a celebrated general or something.
[143:09.32]Very helpful subtitles.
[143:10.34]Hello, sir.
[143:32.69]Hello, gringo.
[143:33.81]So you are the bounty hunter, huh?
[143:36.35]Have you found your prey yet?
[143:38.33]No, sir.
[143:39.66]Ah, perhaps you've come to hunt me, huh?
[143:42.10]Your country loves to make trouble in mine.
[143:43.98]Alright, leave politics out of this.
[143:46.60]No politics.
[143:47.24]Perhaps I should tie you to a horse and let it drag you around town or let the dogs fight you, huh?
[143:56.59]That guy's always laughing.
[143:57.67]Then see what you say.
[143:59.81]I'd say the same thing.
[144:01.94]I'm here to bring two men to justice, nothing more.
[144:05.66]Your politics or ideas of entertainment are not my concern.
[144:09.56]Let me ask you this, sir.
[144:11.72]Do you know anything of the men I'm looking for?
[144:25.29]I love how the subtitles are just like subtitles.
[144:27.75]Whoa, we got it.
[144:30.17]Well, I was gone, I think.
[144:32.84]Two magpie.
[144:34.18]Two magpie gave $17.
[144:35.74]Thanks a lot.
[144:39.66]I know you get messages like this a lot, but thanks for everything.
[144:42.70]Thank you for everything.
[144:43.96]None of you guys are under any obligation at all to give me money.
[144:49.77]Yeah, you do.
[144:52.11]They turned their back on him.
[144:54.94]And that's something I'm forever grateful for.
[144:56.67]I was looking away.
[144:57.27]I was looking at chat for a second.
[144:58.51]And I thought I had food as well.
[144:59.51]This is the cigar.
[145:24.35]...but I know one thing, Senator Marston... ...'force'... ...'force'... ...must be used... ...IF you are to have your own way.
[145:33.10]I'm sure.
[145:35.08]Now...
[145:36.21]Perhaps you can do me a favor while I find these men for you.
[145:40.99]After we find the men.
[145:42.87]Then I'll help in any way I can.
[145:45.97]You are in no position to negotiate.
[145:48.32]That wasn't in the script, by the way.
[145:50.28]A bunch of desidious men are fighting at Tesoro Azul.
[145:55.58]You head there and you lend your support.
[146:03.53]Okay, I sent some men ahead.
[146:05.05]We'll meet them there.
[146:06.59]Shall we?
[146:31.42]I finally met your great leader.
[146:34.57]He certainly lives up to his reputation.
[146:36.85]What would you know about leadership?
[146:39.15]I swear, every time I get on a horse, my face itches.
[146:41.03]It is easy to criticize power when you have never had it yourself.
[146:44.13]Maybe it is because you have never been in the presence of a strong man before.
[146:48.41]I have seen the pictures of your country in the newspapers.
[146:50.70]Look at all these roads.
[146:51.88]Men printing and decorating...
[146:53.80]These roads look like somebody just drew them in Microsoft Paint.
[146:56.34]They're just everywhere.
[146:58.66]Look at this.
[146:59.26]That just looks like somebody just scribbled random roads in MSP.
[147:03.04]Colonel Allende controls any situation he's in because he knows that situation can never be allowed to control him.
[147:09.23]It is what a leader must do.
[147:10.89]And in case you had not noticed, we're fighting a war.
[147:14.27]We're all under a lot of pressure.
[147:16.61]I hope not.
[147:17.73]The colonel needs recreation like everyone else.
[147:20.65]He does not have time to...
[147:21.87]It's very mutual at that point.
[147:24.27]Race?
[147:24.71]I don't want to race it.
[147:25.93]No races!
[147:26.31]We were just talking about how I didn't want to race.
[147:28.54]And now we have to race.
[147:29.42]So that means that I have to beat him first try, because otherwise we're going to have to listen to that whole thing again.
[147:58.39]Stay on the road.
[147:59.23]Come on.
[148:05.57]Sidewalk Gulch.
[148:06.53]He's gonna pass me here.
[148:08.55]I need to... Yeah.
[148:15.21]Prompt two races.
[148:16.04]I love it.
[148:16.60]Please get out of the way.
[148:18.58]I don't want to run into some stupid kid on the road.
[148:37.13]I win.
[148:37.33]Cheat and use horse pills to shoot his horse.
[148:39.91]We're barging in.
[148:40.35]Search the town for rebels.
[148:41.37]Uh...
[149:05.29]Found him.
[149:06.79]Found him.
[149:08.47]What?
[149:09.01]What?
[149:10.27]Why?
[149:10.69]I didn't have a gun.
[149:11.79]I didn't have a gun.
[149:12.55]I held my hands out.
[149:13.71]I just walked in there pretty much holding my hands in the air going, don't shoot me.
[149:19.68]What?
[149:21.32]Like, what?
[149:22.16]What?
[149:23.06]I don't, sometimes I don't understand this game.
[149:26.72]Like, what the fuck?
[149:31.70]Now I don't have my hands out.
[149:32.74]I have a gun this time.
[149:39.57]Go find the rebels in there.
[149:41.55]Oh, I wonder where they are.
[149:45.27]That guy fell into that guy and he died.
[149:58.00]Well, okay.
[150:04.58]Okay.
[150:07.38]Fucking Tomb Raider.
[150:08.34]Let's go.
[150:08.78]This guy's still alive.
[150:11.32]Looks like it's directly in the head.
[150:39.17]Come on.
[150:41.79]Find the rebels.
[150:42.80]Is this a rebel?
[150:48.32]Look how many people are over here.
[150:49.46]Hold on a second!
[150:51.02]No, shit!
[150:51.60]I freaked out!
[150:52.18]Alright, I did it.
[150:59.31]It's okay.
[151:00.85]They all did the baseball slide over here.
[151:02.33]I got them.
[151:05.70]This guy's on the roof.
[151:08.32]Show yourself.
[151:10.16]You clearly don't like me much!
[151:15.87]Just had a little adjustment to do.
[151:21.23]Sorry, partner.
[151:22.67]That guy ran full speed into the wall.
[151:24.52]He would have died anyways.
[151:26.64]Didn't even need to shoot that guy.
[151:29.22]I heard the little horse crying in that house over there.
[151:32.77]That lady a rebel?
[151:34.41]Burn some buildings down.
[152:03.44]How do I have?
[152:03.74]Get some fire.
[152:04.26]Okay, we gotta get some molotovs here.
[152:06.04]Okay.
[152:06.20]How many can I take?
[152:07.04]Okay.
[152:07.26]I have ten of them.
[152:08.56]We're in a hideout.
[152:09.38]Okay.
[152:35.24]Easy.
[152:35.54]This is just teaching me how to throw grenades.
[152:39.82]And last one.
[152:47.64]Alright.
[152:50.42]Lose this guy.
[152:54.32]Got six dollars on him.
[152:59.74]Isn't that beautiful?
[153:01.29]Dead eye, throw a bottle at a bird.
[153:03.05]Okay, I will.
[153:04.00]Dead eye, a bird.
[153:11.38]How far away?
[153:12.00]Can they be close?
[153:20.12]New items are available in stores.
[153:21.42]That's good to know.
[153:22.48]I can't go in there.
[153:23.12]I need to loot a body, but I can't do anything about it.
[153:26.16]Let's refill on these.
[153:30.25]Because they're free, might as well take them if I can.
[153:32.19]I guess I can't.
[153:32.65]Oh, whatever.
[153:33.63]Alright, you guys want me to dead-eye lock onto a bird?
[153:39.61]The bird has to be flying.
[153:40.79]Okay.
[153:52.24]Looking for birds.
[153:56.46]What year is it?
[153:57.82]Uh, 2010.
[154:05.11]We got our Marlatovs out.
[154:06.75]Just looking for a bird.
[154:07.71]Well, good thing that the horse was smarter than me.
[154:25.61]Are there any birds in Mexico?
[154:26.99]What's going on here?
[154:29.85]I didn't know that Mexico was a birdless country.
[154:38.05]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[154:38.97]Bird?
[154:39.55]Nope.
[154:48.04]I'm surprised we haven't seen a bird.
[154:51.18]Bird.
[154:51.72]Bird.
[154:52.18]Bird.
[154:52.76]Bird.
[154:59.90]What?
[155:02.06]Uh, hold on.
[155:02.74]Wait, what?
[155:08.14]How come it won't do it?
[155:11.45]I can't, like, lock onto the bird.
[155:13.83]Uh... I can't.
[155:20.79]It doesn't work.
[155:23.31]Right bumper, right?
[155:24.03]It's not doing anything.
[155:29.85]Yeah, right bumper wasn't doing anything.
[155:38.83]Let's try it again.
[155:39.35]Here comes another bird.
[155:48.67]But it is right bumper.
[155:50.03]I have to get it perfect.
[155:50.99]Does it have to be close?
[155:56.24]How close to the ground does it have to be?
[155:57.36]People are saying this was patched years ago.
[156:01.86]Was it?
[156:18.52]Um.
[156:20.44]Did I get off the horse?
[156:23.33]He was patched midstream.
[156:24.63]Alright, I'm gonna drink like moonshine or whatever.
[156:26.65]Or whatever.
[156:27.21]Snake oil to get this back.
[156:31.09]There's an opportunity right here.
[156:32.47]This guy's pretty close.
[156:33.89]Right here, right?
[156:39.21]Bird right here.
[156:42.48]Okay, I got it.
[156:42.94]I got it.
[156:50.37]What?
[156:50.80]Why was that so funny?
[156:54.80]What?
[156:56.72]I don't understand.
[156:57.81]It just like... Oh, wow.
[157:01.13]That was fucking...
[157:19.51]Fucking heat-sinking okay, that was funny, but it didn't work on the bird it worked on a guy Let's try it again
[157:53.19]Okay, that's fucking funny.
[157:55.67]That's so stupid.
[158:09.48]What?
[158:10.88]What?
[158:11.16]Hey!
[158:11.82]Alright, let's go.
[158:19.65]That's so fucking funny.
[158:22.99]Alright, yeah, it was funny.
[158:24.31]Alright, it was a funny joke.
[158:25.55]Now let's not waste every molotov we own.
[158:28.05]I thought deadhive mollies were just a meme.
[158:35.32]Well, they are.
[158:38.56]Oh shit, I can't go this far.
[158:40.38]Oh no, oh no.
[158:41.34]We can't go this far.
[158:43.90]Oh god, oh god.
[158:45.36]There's fucking water here.
[158:55.13]They can't go in the water and neither can I. That's pretty funny.
[159:10.12]Come on.
[159:10.76]Stay with it.
[159:11.86]There we go.
[159:19.25]I'm going so far away right now.
[159:23.95]Playing that, like, beach level in Mario Kart.
[159:26.54]GOD DAMN!
[159:42.05]Well, we're done.
[159:42.83]We made it.
[159:43.31]Okay.
[159:47.05]Just like Mario.
[159:51.86]Let's just go back to D. We did what we needed to do.
[160:02.19]No more birds.
[160:09.33]Yeah, that really did, like, electrocute me.
[160:10.65]I just got hurt.
[160:11.77]There's water right in front of me.
[160:16.37]I should have seen it coming, but how would I have been able to do it?
[160:18.39]I just wouldn't have.
[160:27.03]Fucking people are idiots.
[160:28.83]Honest to God.
[160:31.37]And now this guy's in trouble.
[160:32.31]You lost your horse.
[160:33.45]Get back on your horse.
[160:36.21]You should have been smarter about that.
[160:39.46]This guy, what is your problem, really?
[160:52.54]Why would Marston know how to swim?
[160:56.75]You know, this is like an old trope in video games, and I never understood it.
[160:59.75]I mean, I kind of do.
[161:00.49]Because it takes a lot of programming, and you have to essentially design around the fact that people are going to do it.
[161:07.45]People are going to go in the water, they want to swim, they want to go to the bottom, they want to explore, and it takes time and effort to put that in.
[161:13.91]But, I mean, the fact that old video game characters were made out of, like, 4,000 pound cinder blocks...
[161:21.74]Like, people just don't sink and die instantly.
[161:24.14]If you jump in the water, if I jump into a water that's 5,000 feet deep, I don't, like, sink to the bottom and my feet hit the ground, like, and I just die instantly.
[161:35.51]At least give me, like, a drowning animation.
[161:37.21]Give me, like, a, like, you fucking clawing and you die, you know what I mean?
[161:41.65]Don't just sink to the bottom of the ocean.
[161:43.13]That doesn't happen.
[161:47.79]Gunsmith.
[161:53.95]And, like, even like Super Mario, right?
[161:55.39]In Super Mario Bros.
[161:56.21]1.
[161:56.23]Like, come on, man.
[161:58.11]Like, even touching the water kills you.
[161:59.73]Just if your toe, like... Like, that shouldn't happen.
[162:04.45]Show Mario fucking clawing and drowning.
[162:09.23]Like, where was that animation back in, like, fucking 1993?
[162:12.68]Mario should have hit the water and been like... And, like, then, like, after 12 to 25 seconds of that, you know, the animation ends and you start over.
[162:24.50]And he's like spitting up fucking blood coming out of his esophagus and shit.
[162:27.72]Like, it should be in the game.
[162:28.83]Okay.
[162:29.01]Oh, we got semi-automatic pistol.
[162:30.65]Semi-auto shotgun.
[162:32.85]Why are these not available?
[162:52.73]Thousand bucks.
[162:54.83]I do not have a thousand dollars.
[162:56.37]Wow, Wolfheart.
[162:57.51]Twelve dollars.
[163:00.29]It's worth a lot of money, actually.
[163:04.81]These are worth a lot.
[163:10.84]Um... Is a semi-automatic pistol better than the Schofield, or is it not worth me dropping $300 right now?
[163:17.58]Fire bottle.
[163:18.90]Dynamite, not available.
[163:20.10]Let's see.
[163:24.23]Fast rate of fire.
[163:25.23]A lot of ammo.
[163:28.34]Extreme rate of fire and extreme reload speed.
[163:31.08]And, okay.
[163:32.28]That's great.
[163:35.60]Bolt action rifle.
[163:36.52]Semi-auto shotgun.
[163:38.00]Jesus.
[163:38.34]When did you guys tell me the Buffalo rifle is, like, really good?
[163:45.15]Semi-auto is OP as shit.
[163:46.43]Okay.
[163:47.51]Maybe.
[163:51.33]For now, I'm gonna, um...
[163:54.90]Maybe I'll get the semi-auto.
[163:55.78]It's 300.
[163:55.94]I'm going to get it.
[163:57.66]I do.
[163:58.40]But I want to have ammo.
[163:59.50]Pistol ammo.
[164:00.38]Let's just fucking get a bunch of it.
[164:05.16]Let's take a look at it.
[164:23.74]You've acquired a new weapon in the same category as mine.
[164:25.60]Yeah, I know.
[164:28.20]Semi-automatic pistol.
[164:32.30]Thing looks cool.
[164:35.06]7 out of 93.
[164:35.56]Yeah.
[164:37.90]Why am I getting failfishes for this?
[164:44.78]This thing's fucking cool.
[164:46.78]Semi-automatic pistol?
[164:47.66]That's fucking pretty sick.
[164:53.81]Alright, let's do this mission over here.
[165:01.20]Try it out on the locals.
[165:03.24]I just bought property.
[165:04.18]I just bought property.
[165:08.60]Why am I getting fail fishes?
[165:14.94]Shut up.
[165:17.99]I can get it for free.
[165:19.07]Shut up, you butthead.
[165:25.83]There we go.
[165:28.21]Let's do it.
[165:31.61]Empty promises.
[165:40.82]Did I watch Donnie Darko recently?
[165:42.58]No.
[165:42.68]Hey, thank you, Ozone.
[165:44.60]For these six bucks.
[165:45.12]Much appreciated.
[165:55.43]Can I get a mock reaction of you receiving $1,000?
[165:57.23]Like in a donation.
[165:58.59]Yeah, sure.
[165:58.95]Just chilling out, riding on a horse.
[166:00.83]What's that?
[166:01.17]Somebody gave $1,000?
[166:01.63]Somebody gave $1,000.
[166:02.09]Cool.
[166:02.35]Nice.
[166:02.61]Thanks, dude.
[166:19.86]You know, I wish I could just jump on first.
[166:22.52]Let's go now.
[166:22.94]Let's go now.
[166:23.54]Drive Vizanta to Kokomata.
[166:50.58]I guess we can just skip this, right?
[166:51.98]We don't have to do this.
[166:52.70]If you shoot the horses, they go faster.
[167:01.72]Arston, wake up.
[167:02.94]We're almost there.
[167:03.66]Not true.
[167:03.94]Wake up?
[167:04.28]I was asleep.
[167:06.20]Let's check out.
[167:06.64]Let's try my new semi-automatic pistol.
[167:10.89]Keep your eye out.
[167:11.85]I have a bad feeling about this.
[167:13.69]Mm-hmm.
[167:15.91]Ramos, hold them off!
[167:17.23]We're now far from the camp!
[167:28.92]Uh, pretty good gun, I think.
[167:33.83]Gun's pretty good.
[167:34.49]I think it's a pretty good gun.
[167:37.25]I like it.
[167:49.89]I actually do really like this guy.
[167:53.62]I like the sound too.
[167:56.12]It's got a good mouthfeel, you know what I mean?
[167:59.82]It's got a real good mouthfeel.
[168:01.14]Just gonna like, swirl it around him.
[168:03.82]Swirl, swirl.
[168:04.58]Mhm.
[168:05.44]Put this fuckin' oak in there, this little bit of this aged in a barrel.
[168:08.53]Fuckin' good stuff.
[168:14.13]Pickin' up some fuckin' apple notes.

[172:14.70]I really do.
[172:16.72]I can't just like run over their bodies.
[172:17.86]There's a lot of money to be had though.

[174:03.10]Easy.
[174:11.82]Come on, that was a moving target.
[174:13.24]Give me a break.
[174:15.69]That was a legit moving target that I just legited.
[174:19.39]I just legitimized that guy.
[174:24.01]Try to tell me I didn't just fucking legitimize that guy.
[174:25.87]That guy got notarized.
[174:27.25]He got killed so bad, you know what I mean?
[174:40.25]You shouldn't have fucked so hard.
[174:41.67]Did you say you shouldn't have fucked so hard?
[174:45.69]What?
[174:47.19]Am I mishearing that?
[174:48.71]The name of the gun.
[174:50.94]The Legitimizer.
[174:52.22]There's obviously a sniper over here.
[174:57.16]You see where I'm aiming, right?
[174:59.98]What?
[175:18.99]And he gets it!
[175:37.41]That guy was so dead.
[175:40.73]He's left.
[175:43.43]He's up here.
[175:50.62]Put the pistol back out here.
[176:01.90]I wanna do an absolutely epic fucking shot here.
[176:05.33]I gotta get like seven people with this.
[176:11.39]One.
[176:12.45]Two.
[176:13.53]Three, four.
[176:15.77]Five, six.
[176:18.57]Seven!
[176:25.79]I want to aim at the guy that's back here.
[176:31.65]Let's get seven more kills.
[176:39.21]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[176:44.95]Killed fucking seven people.
[176:48.87]There's so many people here, my god.
[176:52.54]Are you kidding me?
[176:57.03]Jesus, this is like kind of insane.
[177:02.07]Let's actually go up to something crazy.
[177:14.52]Kind of crazy.
[177:15.10]Good enough.
[177:20.93]Guys at the top there.
[177:26.22]Anybody else at the top?
[177:28.36]I see you right there.
[177:30.18]Who else?
[177:31.34]TNT!
[177:43.26]Somebody did the hostage thing where like don't shoot the hostage you jumped up and they instantly died And then he fell down that was really odd
[178:08.50]Yeah, in every light gun game, you know like the innocent that just stands up after like four people you shoot in a row?
[178:12.76]Like, don't shoot!
[178:13.58]And you shoot them and it takes away a life.
[178:14.90]That's what just happened.
[178:17.46]Except that was actually a bad guy.
[178:26.50]Somebody gave five dollars.
[178:27.38]I can't see the name unfortunately, but thank you.
[178:30.40]Let's see.
[178:30.68]How am I today?
[178:31.30]I'm very good today.
[178:32.88]Hopefully you aren't good too.
[178:34.62]You've never seen that in any real game?
[178:36.63]What are you talking about?
[178:37.67]That's in so many light gun games.
[178:49.59]And that's in the first light gun game ever.
[178:54.53]The one with the cops and robbers in the window.
[178:57.75]You shoot, like, there's, like, nine windows.
[178:59.31]You shoot in the windows with, like, the duck hunt gun.
[179:02.41]And they flip over the panels and... Oh, it's an innocent person!
[179:04.98]What are you talking about?
[179:05.54]That's in, like, a million games.
[179:09.52]What the hell's a light gun?
[179:12.54]Oh, boy.
[179:17.29]Am I really that old?
[179:20.99]You guys don't remember, like, Time Crisis?
[179:27.69]That was a good amount of money.
[179:31.33]You're becoming more famous.
[179:32.81]Posses, bounty hunters, and other pursuit wait twice as long before repeatedly accosting you.
[179:37.17]Okay.
[179:37.49]I love how there's still a dead guy in here.
[179:42.75]And there's not.
[179:44.96]There's TNT in here, though.
[179:49.50]Yeah, you don't remember when it's like... You have a certain amount of time to beat the game and then it goes... Action!
[179:56.65]Action!
[179:57.59]Action!
[179:59.09]Somebody will know what I'm talking about.
[180:02.67]These guys play Five Finger Salute sooner or later here.
[180:08.47]Yeah, with the pedal, you press the pedal down and you let go of the pedal.
[180:13.01]Let's go.
[180:16.09]Reload!
[180:16.71]Reload!
[180:17.32]Reload!
[180:19.67]You had to shoot off the screen?
[180:20.81]I'm surprised a lot of you guys haven't played those before.
[180:25.26]Alright.
[180:27.34]We have L and D again.
[180:28.34]I'm going to have to sleep and go over here.
[180:30.18]Well.
[180:32.44]Okay.
[180:32.70]Okay.
[180:48.70]I was thinking I could get it.
[180:49.76]At that point, I had to commit.
[180:52.09]Once I fell down the first part, I was like, let me try and commit.
[180:54.57]Nope.
[181:00.07]And look where we are.
[181:00.75]Perfect.
[181:02.97]Absolutely perfect.
[181:04.15]Now I can just travel.
[181:09.54]You and your Skyrim logic.
[181:20.63]We've seen that work like three times now though.
[181:25.16]There's a Twitch clip of that working.
[181:29.95]So don't tell me it's not going to work when we've seen it work like three or four times.
[181:33.39]Come on.
[181:36.26]I need to go to bed though.
[181:45.14]Is there like a little place I can go sleep?
[181:49.77]Yes, there is.
[181:53.03]Let me go to sleep in the town.
[181:54.13]I can't do like that old school thing.
[182:06.65]What game was that in?
[182:08.09]Oh my god, this is gonna drive me crazy when you can like jump up the wall.
[182:13.25]What the fuck was the name of the game?
[182:14.47]This is gonna drive me nuts.
[182:15.47]You can, like, go, like... What game was it where there was a little wall that you could, like, climb, jump, jump, jump, jump, and eventually get all the way up?
[182:22.65]What the hell was it?
[182:34.92]It was a very specific corner.
[182:42.25]No, not Qbert.
[182:43.31]There's a guy coming in here right now.
[182:47.03]Yes?
[182:55.66]I'm sorry.
[182:56.54]I don't care.
[182:57.00]Might as well meet this person because they're here.
[183:08.68]Can I trouble you for a minute?
[183:11.38]Talk to the man.
[183:12.69]Excuse me, sir.
[183:13.59]Excuse me.
[183:15.61]You are an American, are you not?
[183:18.19]Last time I checked.
[183:19.41]Oh, thank God, sir.
[183:20.97]Thank God.
[183:21.57]It's time crisis three.
[183:23.05]Yeah, time crisis three.
[183:23.95]I have had it up to here with dagos up to here.
[183:27.10]Oh, these dagos have memes.
[183:28.76]Many memes.
[183:29.76]Well, I do what I can to help.
[183:31.30]But this land was imagined by an angry God for an angry people.
[183:36.58]Well, America ain't exactly a peaceful Paradise, mister.
[183:39.47]Well, I tried, but at least you lot tried to speak bloody English.
[183:44.79]This bloody lot.
[183:46.47]My God, if I'd wanted to speak Spanish, I'd have gone to Spain.
[183:50.75]Actually, I was going to have my stream title be that, by the way.
[183:56.71]It was going to be Red Dead Dance Revolution, but people would think it was an actual dancing game, so I didn't do it.
[184:07.29]I'd give you a reward for picking up a package of mine from the docks.
[184:13.25]There's some fighting broken out there.
[184:15.89]It seems like it's more your kind of thing.
[184:19.20]Why would I want to do something like that?
[184:21.76]You Americans are all the same.
[184:24.38]Obsessed with bloody money.
[184:26.46]Well, I will pay you, sir.
[184:28.38]I will give you a buck.
[184:29.54]This is a famous voice actor.
[184:32.71]The name...
[184:36.21]leaves me right now.
[184:36.99]Alright, now turn around and throw Molotov at his back immediately.
[184:43.43]No.
[184:43.55]Let me just go to bed.
[185:10.54]Go to sleep.
[185:11.18]Wake up.
[185:11.58]Go to L. You failed to stop the crime.
[185:14.68]Oh, whatever.
[185:15.02]I didn't want to do that anyway.
[185:18.22]How did I end up down there?
[185:22.12]How do I get to my room?
[185:23.10]Where's my room?
[185:27.71]Is it in the back of the house?
[185:30.35]I bought this, didn't I?
[185:31.63]Yeah, it's right there.
[185:33.95]You can't come in my room.
[185:34.75]You're not allowed in my room.
[185:48.00]No poker.
[185:50.88]Not playing poker.
[185:51.64]I don't know how to play it.
[185:53.57]I can do blackjack.
[185:54.61]I know the rules of blackjack.
[185:56.15]You can't play poker unless you know poker.
[185:59.29]Otherwise, you're going to lose money.
[186:00.51]A lot of it.
[186:02.29]I thought that was a cat.
[186:04.58]Look at that cat right there.
[186:08.24]That's a cat.
[186:09.56]Come on.
[186:09.98]Let's go from far away and I'll show you how much of a cat that is.
[186:15.43]Look.
[186:18.50]That's a cat.
[186:23.12]Look at this cat!
[186:25.02]Look at the tail, the way it's sitting.
[186:26.34]Dogs don't sit like this.
[186:32.35]Fucking cat.
[186:34.83]I don't want to do any mission right now.
[186:39.12]I want to go to L.
[186:45.03]I mean, I could just do this.
[186:46.17]It's so easy.
[186:47.45]And it's a bunch of money every time.
[186:52.09]No, no.
[186:54.55]Not right now.
[187:00.83]Let's just do what we're supposed to be doing.
[187:03.90]I don't want to get banned again from gambling.
[187:14.43]Goat incoming.
[187:15.64]No, goat alive.
[187:21.86]Molly the goat?
[187:23.74]No.
[187:26.32]I don't think so.
[187:32.45]I don't remember this being this far away, but it is.
[187:42.87]Why?
[187:51.49]Streamer kills dog?
[187:52.61]I didn't kill any dog.
[187:53.59]I didn't shoot him.
[187:54.53]What are you talking about?
[187:58.99]That dog was not chopped.
[188:01.83]You're making that up.
[188:03.25]Don't make things up.
[188:05.72]Don't make things up about me.
[188:06.84]I don't like it.
[188:14.54]Almost there.
[188:19.61]And here we are.
[188:20.33]Is this place burnt down?
[188:23.85]What the fuck?
[188:27.08]She's just sitting on the smoldering ashes.
[188:29.08]What's wrong, Luisa?
[188:31.34]I don't wait for myself before my country.
[188:34.24]Abram Reyes has been captured.
[188:35.68]He has?
[188:36.86]Was it like this before?
[188:39.84]He was coming to meet me at Roca Madera.
[188:42.30]It's a very romantic spot.
[188:44.18]It was a beautiful night.
[188:45.96]And he was ambushed by patrol.
[188:48.31]My heart is breaking, but I cry for Mexico.
[188:54.87]Where's he being held?
[188:57.47]El Presidio.
[188:58.49]How come she's not talking about her house?
[188:59.75]I know in our hearts we are married already, but his family do not approve.
[189:04.33]How could they?
[189:05.59]When I'm little more than a passive girl.
[189:08.48]But that's what makes Abram the man he is.
[189:10.92]He doesn't care for their bourgeois, snobbery, or elitism.
[189:15.46]He sees the real me.
[189:17.64]The woman.
[189:19.65]That was a really awkward stance.
[189:22.63]Why do they have their leg in the air?
[189:26.20]That's what everyone keeps informing me.

[193:42.74]Oh, fucking god damn it.
[193:44.26]Ah, you did that on purpose.
[193:46.51]I did not fucking do that on purpose, actually.
[193:49.57]I jumped down on purpose, that's for sure.
[193:51.85]Not down there.
[193:52.61]I'm going to make this bit too easy, for Christ's sake.
[194:01.17]I'm going to take that right seriously, dude.
[194:02.71]Right now.

[195:43.34]I wish this wasn't worth doing, but it is.
[195:47.24]Going and collecting everything from everybody.
[195:49.20]Somebody just has ten bucks, like, every time.
[195:53.34]You can get an entire mission's worth of money by looting, like, five people.
[195:56.78]As kind of much of a pain in the ass as it is.
[196:02.68]Yeah, well, that... We don't actually have to.
[196:04.68]There's no time limit here.
[196:06.28]Okay, now we can leave.
[196:18.39]Pick this guy up with the horse.
[196:20.94]Can I just have my horse?
[196:24.76]My horse is better.
[196:25.56]Come here.
[196:27.00]Wow, that was... Alright.
[196:32.83]That's pretty sick.
[196:35.95]Come on!
[196:45.06]Here we go.
[196:45.50]So where are we going?
[196:47.24]Luis has hit me.
[196:48.26]Vamos, dete prisa.
[196:49.36]The army's coming.
[196:52.02]The army is coming.
[196:54.16]Well, yes, they are.
[196:54.90]Look out!
[196:58.83]What am I doing?
[197:02.65]Just a chest dive.
[197:03.21]It doesn't even matter.
[197:03.93]It's over.
[197:04.83]Okay.
[197:05.19]I don't think I'm going to narrow a little road like this.
[197:10.67]This is a bad place.
[197:12.31]I see more in front of us.
[197:17.85]Why did he fucking fall off?
[197:22.19]Why did he fall off?
[197:24.21]Why did he fucking fall off the horse?
[197:32.32]Where are you going?
[197:33.10]Stop running around!
[197:34.24]What are you doing?
[197:35.22]Get on!
[197:35.92]Get on the fucking horse!
[197:37.56]Get on the horse!
[197:40.90]Get on the horse!
[197:42.12]Get on the horse!
[197:43.60]And stay on the fucking horse!
[197:45.38]Don't immediately fucking jump off of it!
[197:47.94]You fucking stupid motherfucker!
[197:52.32]Okay, let's get- stay on, please.
[197:55.16]Hold- please, hold on to me!
[197:58.25]Put your arms around my waist.
[198:01.06]Like you're supposed to be doing.
[198:02.74]Like, I don't know why he's not wrapping his arms around me.
[198:08.28]He went out of his saddle.
[198:09.42]He doesn't have anything to hold on to.
[198:11.20]Hold on to me.
[198:12.18]Well, try to resist the urge.
[198:21.43]How do you know my young lover, Laura?
[198:24.15]It's Luisa.
[198:25.67]I saved her life not so long back.
[198:28.45]I will not forget this, compadre.
[198:30.30]You will be rewarded with money, women... Slow down.
[198:33.30]I don't want to get knocked off the road by this idiot.
[198:34.64]I'm here for two minutes, and that's it.
[198:36.90]You've been spending too much time with Captain de Salta.
[198:39.68]This guy will push me off the road into the water, and it will be not fun.
[198:42.66]I'll explain later.
[198:47.27]I am free again.
[198:48.61]I will write a poem about this day.
[198:50.59]This is from a man who was tied to a post with a gun in his face a few minutes ago.
[198:55.65]Why did your horse not run out of stamina?
[198:58.55]Mind up.
[198:59.87]All you've done is get on the back of this horse, my friend.
[199:02.77]She's up ahead.
[199:06.17]Are we rescuing her?
[199:10.15]She's over there.
[199:11.44]I remember her now.
[199:13.06]Mi amiga.
[199:14.99]There she is, right?
[199:15.73]I don't get it.
[199:18.67]Okay, why was he going forward?
[199:20.41]Abraham!
[199:21.27]Mr. Marston!
[199:22.29]The revolution will live on thanks to you.
[199:25.13]Yes, indeed, young.
[199:26.83]You are as a brother to me.
[199:29.15]And my people need a man such as you to help our cause.
[199:33.18]My ranch is in Agave Viejo.
[199:34.78]And let me say, my brother, that we await you.
[199:39.31]Well, best of luck to both of you, but I need to find two men so I can return to America.
[199:43.58]He just fell off the horse twice.
[199:45.05]No problem.
[199:45.49]I will help you find those men.
[199:47.55]And you return.
[199:49.37]You will win a people her freedom.
[199:51.43]You see the horse?
[199:53.33]Laura, fuck.
[199:53.88]Laura, give me the strength to fight
[200:19.37]Okay.
[200:19.67]200 fame.
[200:24.89]Are they still just sitting right here?
[200:30.85]The dock isn't even there anymore.
[200:31.97]Okay.
[200:36.56]We don't have any more L. We do have D, though.
[200:39.44]We've got plenty of D. We're going to go to Escalera.
[200:44.36]I think I'll take a quick little nap right here.
[200:48.02]Go to Escalera.
[200:56.23]Travel to Escalera!
[201:04.33]Is it gonna be a late night stream?
[201:05.55]Well, we started like three and a half hours ago.
[201:07.87]We started at the normal time.
[201:10.39]I mean... These streams have been a little longer than usual just because I'm playing Red Dead.
[201:17.14]I'm enjoying Red Dead.
[201:18.94]So I'm gonna continue to play and enjoy Red Dead.
[201:23.20]The stream might be four hours, might be five.
[201:24.90]I don't know.
[201:25.84]They've been longer just because I'm like doing a playthrough, in quotes, right?
[201:31.16]Let's go here.
[201:34.80]It's right there.
[201:35.80]I don't know.
[201:36.40]Why did I do that?
[201:40.95]Let's go.
[201:41.27]It's just the D on the mini-map.
[201:42.21]There you go.
[201:46.59]Shortcut.
[201:49.75]Told you.
[201:52.34]Shortcut part two.
[201:54.61]Told you.
[201:57.21]Shortcut part three.
[202:04.57]Alright, they can't go this way.
[202:20.08]Turn around.
[202:35.37]Get the fuck in the house.
[202:37.71]Come on.
[202:38.13]The horse can't go in the house?
[202:47.38]So I'd have to go the regular way.
[202:48.54]God damn it.
[202:49.16]I don't want to have to do this.
[202:50.36]I want just to go up.
[202:56.01]For the love of God, I have to go down.
[203:05.78]Why does this house have to be all the way around?
[203:09.48]You can't, like, put the house somewhere else.
[203:13.34]There we go.
[203:18.23]Just get the fuck off the horse.
[203:19.45]Just get me in here, please.
[203:24.41]Just, I'll just, I'll go this way.
[203:25.73]Whatever.
[203:26.29]Just climb the fence.
[203:29.38]You're like fucking compound.
[203:30.64]I can't even climb this.
[203:35.38]It's like one way into this piece of shit place.
[203:38.76]Really?
[203:39.14]Come on.
[203:41.10]Yeah, now I can get there.
[203:54.83]I have to go in the front fucking door.
[203:57.66]Okay, I'm here.
[203:58.58]Thanks.
[203:58.94]Thanks for letting me in.
[204:01.04]Wait, what?
[204:01.40]Okay.
[204:05.63]Check back between 7am and there's people screaming again.
[204:07.93]That's great.
[204:19.28]I can't just like do drugs and have time pass.
[204:24.13]It's definitely almost 6am.
[204:28.85]I can't just like smoke a bunch of crack and like fucking four hours will go by.
[204:37.49]They had a crack in the Wild West, right?
[204:43.67]Oh my god.
[204:55.25]Go out here and put a campfire down.
[205:02.94]Go to bed.
[205:07.36]Use the Metal Gear Cigar.
[205:08.40]I know, right?
[205:11.93]And it'll just go... It goes like... And the fucking time goes crazy.
[205:17.19]It needs to be in every video game.
[205:23.54]I would try to do that, but there ain't no way I can hit those notes.
[205:35.50]You gotta be actually, like, musically talented to hit that note.
[205:46.53]Did I make it to New Vegas?
[205:47.59]Not yet.
[205:50.50]I don't think that exists.
[205:52.74]I did make it to, like, loud air conditioner, though.
[205:55.82]Oh my fucking god.
[206:03.20]I did unlock an extremely loud air conditioning unit right next to my house.
[206:12.37]How much is that worth?
[206:17.45]Okay, here we go.
[206:22.16]Mexican Caesar!
[206:24.71]Thank you, Dolos, for the bits.
[206:26.55]They just say, try hard.
[206:28.95]I am trying hard, actually.
[206:30.49]You're right.
[206:31.03]I just did.
[206:31.59]What's going on here, Captain DeSanta?
[206:35.67]Just a little recruitment.
[206:36.71]Nothing for you to be concerned about.
[206:50.40]You boys using women soldiers now?
[206:52.49]Our customs are none of your concern.
[206:54.73]Apparently not.
[206:56.71]Here comes this guy.
[207:03.83]Here comes the fucking colonel.
[207:08.31]These two patriots were keen to make your acquaintance, be coronel.
[207:13.72]Fantastic.
[207:14.90]I love patriots.
[207:16.40]Ah, Mr. Marsden, you here to fight the war?
[207:20.26]I shall make a patriot of you yet.
[207:22.98]Yeah, I hope so.
[207:25.44]Any word of those men?
[207:26.24]Oh, yes.
[207:28.12]I heard they were riding with Reyes.
[207:30.56]I wanted to talk to you about it.
[207:31.92]Tell him what I wanted.
[207:34.02]I love that it has the Spanish and the English.
[207:37.32]The job is dangerous.
[207:38.16]I think I just appeared out of nowhere.
[207:47.08]That guy just fucking teleported up here.
[207:49.06]And he just puts his hand on him.
[207:50.34]Is this guy a character?
[207:51.44]Does this guy talk?
[207:52.76]This guy feels like he doesn't belong here right now.
[208:06.52]Mexico loves you.
[208:07.34]He's just here.
[208:08.00]I feel like he- okay, you know when you're watching a cutscene in a multiplayer game, and like, you- one of- your friend can move around and- What the fuck?
[208:19.52]Why?
[208:21.26]Why did he just puke?
[208:25.11]Why did he just puke?
[208:28.25]I'm talking about like smoking crack.
[208:33.94]That guy was smoking crack and drinking like ecto-cool.
[208:46.80]Ringo!
[208:47.80]Ringo, are you listening to me?
[208:50.13]Does it seem quiet to you?
[208:53.35]I don't know.
[208:54.45]You tell me.
[208:55.43]We have not seen a single rebel yet.
[208:58.05]I'd say that's a good thing, wouldn't you?
[209:02.39]I'm ready for the rebels.
[209:07.08]Can we go faster?
[209:12.18]Oh no, an explosion.
[209:18.39]And your friend.
[209:19.11]Where is he?
[209:21.59]And your other friend.
[209:22.77]Ah, don't worry about it.
[209:25.60]There he is.
[209:26.22]Don't take care of him.
[209:27.64]I won't be semi-automatic.
[209:29.46]What do I do?
[209:30.70]Shit.
[209:36.60]That's not cool.
[209:37.96]What are we doing?
[209:41.10]Are we driving?
[209:43.00]The guy's not dead.
[209:53.37]Next, if somebody dies.
[209:55.13]Okay.
[210:05.13]Why are we going so slow?
[210:06.50]We stopped for no reason.
[210:15.04]We stopped right in the middle of the fucking road.
[210:48.70]If anyone dies, it's over.
[210:50.60]Okay.
[210:50.92]I didn't know that.
[211:02.02]That took a lot of bullets.
[211:08.65]Where are we moving to?
[211:11.25]Ride with the captain.
[211:13.60]I don't like how it does this cinematic mode.
[211:16.78]Freaking me out.
[211:17.30]That was close.
[211:19.18]I don't know.
[211:19.68]This doesn't feel right to me.
[211:22.66]We're on our way to escort a train to rebel-held country.
[211:25.72]The guy in the back is just bobbing up and down, playing my music.
[211:28.36]That's funny.
[211:29.50]Soldado!
[211:30.36]¿Quién eres?
[211:31.44]¿Cuál escuadrón?
[211:33.00]Somos nuevos reclutas, Capitán.
[211:36.00]I know I have not seen these men before.
[211:40.04]They are new recruits.
[211:41.56]People have been talking about the rebels planning a large attack.
[211:46.69]These supplies are so important.
[211:48.99]Why have we been given so few soldiers?
[211:51.73]Don't ask me.
[211:53.17]You're the captain.
[211:54.75]I thought you were supposed to be fearless.
[211:56.68]I am fearless, but not brainless.
[212:00.50]Stop aiming at your guy's friend.
[212:02.12]There is something wrong.
[212:04.54]I feel it.
[212:06.02]Maybe you just need to take a piss or something.
[212:08.70]Here comes another ambush.
[212:09.46]The colonel told me that the Santa had praised my actions at Torquemada and called me a hero.
[212:14.11]He asked for me to be given this important assignment.
[212:17.37]Why would he do that?
[212:19.35]The cabrón hates me.
[212:21.21]Yeah, but doesn't everybody hate you?
[212:23.63]Maybe we should turn back or wait for reinforcements.
[212:26.21]Wait, the sound got out of sync again?
[212:27.55]It did?
[212:28.59]Another ambush!
[212:30.58]Couldn't be out of sight again.
[212:32.92]I tried to fix that.
[212:37.31]Did I shoot him?
[212:38.35]Wait, is the audio happening first?
[212:58.67]This is happening like a few streams ago.
[213:00.05]Shoot well, gringo.
[213:01.81]Tell me something.
[213:03.16]What is your weapon of choice?
[213:05.42]What do you mean?
[213:06.70]Come, my friend.
[213:08.52]Your belt is full of weapons.
[213:10.68]Which is your favorite for attacking a man?
[213:12.58]You ain't right in the head, Captain.
[213:14.84]Do you want to know what mine is?
[213:17.08]We are close to Chuparosa now.
[213:19.56]I still have a bad feeling about this.
[213:21.79]Tell me, why are you here?
[213:23.75]What did they promise you?
[213:25.61]That is a lot of promises.
[213:29.81]Do you know where Escuela is?
[213:32.53]You think I am going to tell you that before you have fulfilled your obligations?
[213:36.74]Do not take me for a fool.
[213:41.28]You must understand why we are suspicious of you.
[213:44.30]Most American vigilantes come here to help you.
[213:47.37]It is strange you have chosen to work for the army.
[213:51.47]Do I lock my door?
[214:05.05]That's a terrifying thing to ask somebody.
[214:06.86]Hey dude, what's going on?
[214:08.36]Just coming to the stream here.
[214:09.36]Do you lock your doors when you go to bed?
[214:11.84]Yeah, of course I do.
[214:40.74]It's a Twitch problem.
[214:42.08]So if you refresh it gets better.
[214:43.66]That's weird.
[214:44.84]Well, hopefully it's not on my end.
[214:46.16]I tried to fix that the other day.
[214:50.55]This was the worst mission in the game so far, by the way.
[214:53.83]I've enjoyed pretty much every mission except this one.
[214:58.35]We just rode around slowly and I shot like five people.
[215:03.62]And now we're slowly walking.
[215:05.84]Where's mission in the game?
[215:11.23]Complaint?
[215:12.25]That was a complaint.
[215:13.89]No, that was an observation.
[215:15.97]I do not think we have seen the last of the rebels.
[215:18.50]He hates the game.
[215:20.58]I need you to man the Gatling gun.
[215:22.40]I ain't the soldier here, Captain.
[215:23.92]Do not question me, Gringo.
[215:25.68]Just do as I say.
[215:30.03]It might actually get pretty good though.
[215:31.25]We got a Gatling gun now, this might be fun.
[215:33.87]Are we about to make some taffy?
[215:37.55]Are we about to make some fucking pasta?
[215:51.34]Alright guys, you ready to make the fucking pasta?
[215:53.14]Put the wheat there.
[215:54.30]Let me grind up some wheat.
[215:56.02]I'll make some fucking al dente pasta.
[215:59.08]Dave, funny joke.
[216:00.35]Rigatoni's popping.
[216:01.99]Look it, Rigatoni's popping up.
[216:04.27]It's terrible.
[216:05.95]I win that one.
[216:07.81]Alright, well, if you don't even use the gun, then I'll leave the gun.
[216:16.01]Yeah, well, I wasn't exactly expecting a pleasant picnic by the Seaside myself.
[216:38.49]I didn't think... I didn't think... Look, you can't like shoot anybody.
[216:45.08]It has like the blue marker.
[216:50.56]I didn't think... We're good.
[216:53.34]Everything's fine.
[216:54.48]We're fine.
[216:54.96]Just don't... Oh, God.
[217:01.41]What are you doing?
[217:06.60]That was so, like, just stupid and anticlimactic.
[217:09.27]It just was like... The guy just instantly falls down.
[217:12.39]I'm sorry.
[217:14.35]I thought that was very funny.
[217:15.63]My brain couldn't handle that one.
[217:18.35]If I reset the whole mission, then I would have fucking screamed.
[217:21.09]I would have just gone to bed.
[217:21.87]Alright, let's just get this done.
[217:32.54]Let's get it done.
[217:33.72]Keep moving.
[217:34.02]Keep moving.
[217:37.95]Especially because it was one bullet in the Gatling gun.
[217:41.13]I don't want to shoot this far to the left here.
[217:58.44]I'm going to hit somebody's head accidentally.
[218:13.09]No, don't shoot that close.
[218:14.03]I am going to accidentally get what he's got in the head.
[218:29.98]I really am.
[218:30.78]That's going to happen.
[218:41.64]Fuck, take it seriously.
[218:45.76]Aiming this weapon.
[218:47.88]Aiming anything.
[218:49.92]Like, you know what I mean?
[218:50.50]Like, listen.
[218:53.06]That, like, fucking half-second delay.
[218:57.16]What is that?
[218:58.46]What is this?
[219:06.52]Jerma, just refresh your game, and, like, you'll lose the obvious descent.
[219:14.17]Those people are just eating grass.
[219:17.07]They want to be bad guys.
[219:31.73]Oh lord.
[219:32.07]Can I... I can't use Deadeye.
[219:36.13]I'm trying to spy.
[219:43.04]So many unnecessary force steps, by the way.
[219:59.17]One more.
[220:01.59]Nice one.
[220:10.22]Speaking of getting close, this is getting dangerous to shoot with this Gatling gun.
[220:29.15]I'm going to hit a random guy in the head and he's going to just... Wait, wait, wait, a guy got on!
[220:32.69]Somebody got on!
[220:33.81]Which one is the bad guy?
[220:34.81]Which one's the bad guy?
[220:36.05]Who's the bad guy?
[220:38.51]I don't know who the bad guy is.
[220:43.99]I'm not aiming down there.
[220:56.14]Are you like shitting me right now?
[221:00.08]Was that a bad guy?
[221:01.02]Was that a bad guy?
[221:07.33]Get back on him.
[221:09.22]We ran that guy's head over.
[221:27.69]This is lasting a long time.
[221:37.03]Shoot only the horses?
[221:37.75]I feel like the bullets aren't even hitting.
[221:47.70]God.
[221:49.06]I don't understand.
[221:52.00]I don't even fucking concentrate here.
[221:58.60]I fucking swear.
[222:01.19]How is it possible to play video games with the right stick?
[222:05.46]I feel like I'm drunk right now.
[222:08.84]Like I'm fucking shit-faced right now.
[222:12.04]This is the drunkest I've ever been.
[222:37.20]what's going on right now what am I doing I was reloading the gun okay oh my god
[223:06.91]Okay, can I please like sober up and get off this thing?
[223:23.44]Hello?
[223:25.46]Hey!
[223:26.04]Oh.
[223:39.59]I think that's all of it.
[223:41.42]Am I missing something here?
[223:42.58]The base camp is just at the top of the hill.
[223:45.16]That was madness.
[223:46.44]You did well, compadre.
[223:48.14]Very well.
[223:48.68]I almost shot that guy.
[223:49.92]That would have been so angry.
[223:52.87]I don't think DeSantis expected us to come back from this.
[223:55.95]Did you want to kill him, or should I?
[223:58.41]No.
[223:59.21]Until I find Escuela, he's more used to me alive.
[224:04.20]Easy, Jeremy.
[224:05.22]Easy.
[224:06.64]Easy now.
[224:07.80]Not the time.
[224:09.36]This is not the time.
[224:11.18]Easy.
[224:11.38]This is not the fucking time.
[224:25.84]Not the time.
[224:27.66]It's not the time.
[224:30.99]This is not the time for this.
[224:33.71]Don't do it.
[224:34.75]Okay, I'm good.
[224:37.48]Yeah, it just wouldn't be funny right now.
[224:40.80]I'd have to do the whole dumb thing again.
[224:42.42]Don't fucking try it.
[224:43.14]I know.
[224:43.36]I'm wasn't gonna.
[224:44.84]Save by cutscene.
[225:02.35]$75.
[225:02.89]Spurred to victory.
[225:07.77]New items are available in the stores.
[225:10.75]Still got, we have D. Only D. D is the only thing.
[225:16.02]Now let's just go to bed.
[225:17.62]And go to Escalero.
[225:18.78]Let's just do it.
[225:26.96]Uh, thank you GrowDiv for the $5.
[225:28.42]$5.
[225:28.48]Whoa-ho request.
[225:32.39]I'm gonna try it.
[225:35.53]I'll give you guys a, let's see, hold on one second.
[226:06.06]Hold on.
[226:14.49]Let's just go ahead and save it.
[226:28.61]Did that work?
[226:30.23]What was that?
[226:33.73]Did it happen?
[226:37.50]What is this video?
[226:39.36]I need to listen to this.
[226:40.52]I probably will.
[226:41.14]I need to be able to hear this.
[226:46.12]Oh, yeah, there we go, yeah.
[226:50.62]Got it.
[226:52.20]Just making sure it wasn't like something fucked up.
[226:54.02]You know, YouTube videos.
[226:55.98]Could just be like, oh, here we go.
[226:58.10]Here's a funny YouTube video that you just found.
[227:00.12]No, it's not.
[227:00.72]It's like, it's somebody screaming like a bunch of awful things in your ear.
[227:05.88]Let's, uh, let's sleep again.
[227:07.50]Actually, no, we don't, we don't, we don't.
[227:11.24]Uh, but thank you.
[227:12.12]Thank you, Wildcats, as well.
[227:13.76]Also, thank you, RedRider, for the bits.
[227:15.22]Hi, how are you?
[227:15.70]I'm good.
[227:16.56]Dolos, thanks for the bits, as well.
[227:18.94]Oh, you bit donators, thank you.
[227:23.72]Uh, Escalera, right?
[227:25.86]Watch out for the fucking human bones.
[227:27.12]I think you hear a ghost.
[227:31.82]What do you mean, a ghost?
[227:35.44]What does that mean?
[227:40.35]And let's go to D. Yes, D. And D, I just have to walk forward.
[227:45.87]Just go there.
[227:49.94]Don't need the horse.
[227:51.90]Don't need anything.
[227:52.62]Just go in the front fucking door.
[227:54.70]I'm sorry, pal.
[228:01.32]Founding the piano while somebody's sleeping.
[228:06.05]Hold on, I need to see if I can find this.
[228:14.95]Buenas!
[228:17.61]I need to listen to this on... This might be it.
[228:32.35]Alright, what, capture the thief?
[228:43.47]This is not it, by the way.
[228:48.92]This is not it.
[228:51.72]This is like somebody actually playing the piano.
[228:54.26]I can't go in this house.
[229:04.51]It says pounding on the piano.
[229:06.01]No, this is not even it.
[229:14.49]Like, what a fucking lie.
[229:22.83]How about this?
[229:23.23]Let's see.
[229:28.37]This one's called random piano.
[229:38.18]Random piano sounds.
[229:40.24]Look, this video sucks.
[229:41.50]Okay, well, I'm not going to find it, so let's just go.
[229:43.34]I thought I was hearing things.
[229:49.19]Where did I go?
[229:50.29]I just ran the other way.
[229:51.53]Okay.
[229:57.03]Huge moan incoming?
[229:58.70]What are you talking about?
[230:03.26]Go back to D.
[230:08.45]Record you, like, smashing the piano.
[230:10.31]No.
[230:10.63]Don't, like, smash your own piano.
[230:11.87]That's not a good idea.
[230:18.09]I hate going to this place.
[230:21.83]I hate this.
[230:22.37]I hate how there's one entrance.
[230:30.26]Wait, you found it?
[230:33.06]Is this actually it?
[230:38.03]What is this?
[230:39.63]Did you actually find Smash on the piano?
[230:41.53]Are you fucking serious?
[230:50.12]Really?
[230:50.44]That's what you're going to link me?
[230:52.32]Really?
[230:53.86]Really?
[230:54.30]Amazing piano.
[231:00.86]What the fuck is this?
[231:05.23]That's not it!
[231:06.13]That's not it!
[231:06.63]Good news!
[231:06.95]Good news!
[231:07.59]The coronel himself wants to speak to you.
[231:09.93]Come!
[231:10.17]It's not right.
[231:10.55]You guys don't have it.
[231:11.30]It's not right.
[231:11.78]This is not it.
[231:14.88]Look at that ass, huh?
[231:16.18]Magnificent!
[231:25.37]Not save her for later.
[231:26.93]Or I'll kill her and all her family.
[231:28.96]They're probably rebels anyway, huh?
[231:31.90]Anyways, it's good to see you, amigo.
[231:33.70]Good to see you.
[231:34.54]You know, you are a rare find.
[231:37.70]A gringo who is also a friend of our country.
[231:40.30]Bienvenido, we welcome you.
[231:41.24]Okay.
[231:44.91]Relax, relax.
[231:46.25]I have some wonderful news for you.
[231:47.69]What if I just have a terrible piano?
[231:49.59]You know the men you hunt?
[231:51.03]They have been captured in Chuparosa.
[231:53.61]I want you and DeSanta to ride out there, and then you can take possession of them.
[231:58.49]It is my gift to you.
[231:59.69]For all your help.
[232:00.49]For all your help, senor.
[232:02.47]Although part of me wishes that you would remain here and enjoy more of our hospitality.
[232:09.08]Thank you.
[232:09.60]If it's all the same, I'd like to collect the men.
[232:12.24]Alright.
[232:12.44]The wagon has already been prepared.
[232:13.84]Ride shotgun.
[232:14.92]We always ride shotgun.
[232:48.69]I don't think you guys understand what I mean when I say it was like a piano, literally.
[232:51.83]It was like eight pianos layered on top of each other.
[232:55.83]Just being smashed.
[233:05.98]Let's go.
[233:20.48]Here we are.
[233:20.92]Why am I going in here?
[233:24.44]Why do we have Dick Tracy music playing?
[233:50.64]I gotta have my gun ready.
[233:53.78]Shotgun is good.
[233:54.56]This one's like right here.
[233:57.68]Okay.
[234:04.88]Every possible note from every possible timeline.
[234:14.17]Mr. Marston.
[234:16.65]Gracias.
[234:17.15]For your service.
[234:20.71]Is this guy gonna double-cross me right now?
[234:23.23]Yeah he is.
[234:24.43]Of course he is.
[234:27.93]Great.
[234:35.78]So I get double-crossed.
[234:36.76]Where's my magician?
[234:37.60]Does he come and save me?
[234:40.38]Does the magician come save me?
[234:49.34]You have betrayed this land enough.
[234:53.64]I hope you have a clear conscience.
[234:55.76]Where's Mr. Mustache?
[234:56.66]You're about to meet God.
[235:01.72]Yeah, I knew it.
[235:02.74]It's Willem Dafoe.
[235:04.32]They will kill you if we don't get your robes off.
[235:06.22]Over here, I will free you.
[235:09.18]What?
[235:11.06]He shot one guy.
[235:11.88]Wait, he shot one guy?
[235:15.30]What in the name of God is happening?
[235:21.66]Nobody seems to care about me anymore.
[235:24.54]Can I go in the house?
[235:29.46]Okay, I'm gonna go up.
[235:30.64]Is this just the opening of Skyrim?
[235:39.76]I'll have the knife.
[235:41.44]I'll have the knife.
[235:52.22]Alright, gotta get my weapons back.
[235:55.64]Grab the dash.
[235:56.56]There it is.
[235:57.23]Stop it.
[236:01.13]Not at all bad.
[236:02.35]Alright, hit.
[236:02.95]Is that a good gun?
[236:19.92]What?!
[236:22.04]What?!
[236:25.10]I'm so confused.
[236:27.50]That didn't make any sense.
[236:39.15]That's more like it.
[236:39.89]Okay, I gotta kill the captain guy.
[236:53.00]Alright, one last guy.
[236:53.74]We gotta make this work.
[236:54.78]We gotta make this work.
[236:55.68]Dynamite!
[236:56.86]This bloke has gotta help.
[236:58.52]Oh, fuck!
[236:59.82]I thought there was another guy up here.
[237:16.78]Is he in there?
[237:29.82]That was awesome.
[237:30.50]Better than dynamite, I guess.
[237:40.95]Yeah, I guess so.
[237:56.95]Justly ruled by fine men.
[238:00.83]Push him downstairs and put a fucking shocker.
[238:04.81]The job is not done.
[238:07.41]Our struggle is not over.
[238:10.48]We will fight all day and night until local tyrants like Allende are no more.
[238:17.18]And him and all his dogs are brought to the sword.
[238:27.29]We shall be free.
[238:30.43]Let me know if I fixed the sync issue.
[238:34.37]I just dropped something there.
[238:35.83]And one day, and one day soon, again they will know justice.
[238:45.23]My brothers, fight on.
[238:50.07]In our hearts, we are
[239:10.87]Cigarette.
[239:12.09]First time I've seen him smoke.
[239:13.27]He's had one cigarette the whole time he's been here.
[239:15.43]Actually, I want to see if the smoking issue is still... Wait, what is this?
[239:23.23]I'm not... No.
[239:26.26]Looks like it's fixed.
[239:27.04]Because I had to do it... I had to add a delay to it last time.
[239:29.82]Alright, where the hell did he go?
[239:34.02]We got L and we got R now.
[239:36.82]I guess we're going to do L. He smoked at least three times?
[239:42.94]No, he has not.
[239:49.38]He has not.
[239:51.95]I mean, we've actually done a lot of these missions.
[239:53.61]Who's this new person?
[239:55.52]Abraham.
[239:55.92]I feel like we've done, like, all L. We have a new guy.
[240:05.41]Let's see.
[240:11.33]He's a smoker!
[240:13.39]I wish I could just jump off.
[240:15.17]That's why cars are better than horses.
[240:16.75]Because I can just drive off the cliff and land and just keep driving and make it a shortcut.
[240:21.98]There are no shortcuts in Red Dead.
[240:25.90]There aren't.
[240:26.52]I can't do any shortcuts.
[240:27.56]It's my biggest issue.
[240:38.39]I can't just dive off here and land.
[240:42.19]Good observation.
[240:42.95]Well, it's true!
[240:44.41]It's true!
[240:52.46]Look at this.
[240:53.10]See?
[240:53.30]This is exactly what I'm talking about.
[240:55.70]It's right there.
[240:57.31]Look at this.
[240:57.65]It's right... I just have to jump off this.
[241:00.45]No, I have to go all the way around.
[241:02.09]I can do at least this shortcut right here.
[241:06.91]Oh, what a shortcut.
[241:19.39]I also haven't been lassoing any new horses.
[241:21.18]Am I missing out on shit?
[241:22.16]I feel like I am.
[241:25.42]Alright, can I go this way?
[241:28.56]This would be a pretty great shortcut if I could.
[241:35.28]It looks like it's okay.
[241:36.26]I think I made it.
[241:36.68]Yeah, I'm okay.
[241:39.16]Let's get back on the road.
[241:44.94]And... I can't go that.
[241:47.02]I don't think I can... Let me see.
[241:50.23]No, I gotta go like around the whole mountain.
[242:00.40]Ride off the cliff with your horse.
[242:01.52]No, I've done that like a thousand times.
[242:03.08]I'm not doing that again.
[242:04.06]That's not gonna happen.
[242:24.58]I, uh... What the hell is going on?
[242:26.28]That was weird.
[242:31.58]Oh, I just want to jump.
[242:32.36]Okay, we're... What is this?
[242:41.78]What is this?
[242:43.04]This is not even the right place.
[242:47.29]Yes, it is.
[242:48.59]Arm wrestling can now be done.
[242:50.11]That's good.
[242:55.09]This is not correct.
[243:03.66]Actually, maybe this is it.
[243:04.66]Maybe this is it.
[243:06.20]I think this is it.
[243:09.77]Except it was way louder.
[243:21.61]No, actually, it was more than this.
[243:24.16]It was more than that.
[243:24.82]Where is Abraham Reyes?
[243:27.46]Here, amigo!
[243:28.80]Here!
[243:29.16]It's that, like, times ten.
[243:33.14]Well, well, well, look who it is.
[243:36.45]The American bandit turned bounty hunter who is about to win the Mexico Revolution.
[243:41.73]I don't know about that, mister.
[243:43.59]No, but I... I just typed in loud piano.
[243:46.33]I do.
[243:47.44]A man like you...
[243:48.56]What the fuck is this?
[243:49.54]A crazy piano?
[243:50.42]Okay, hold on.
[243:50.94]I gotta turn this off, because this is fucking really fucking loud.
[243:53.40]Let me just make sure.
[243:55.46]Hey, hermanos unidos!
[243:57.64]Set my people free!
[243:59.08]Libre, Mexico!
[244:00.88]Libre, Mexico!
[244:09.73]Their energy is like food to me.
[244:14.53]I feel I was sent for them, and they were sent to me.
[244:18.41]Good for you.
[244:18.95]I'm not answering a YouTube survey.
[244:20.61]When I rule these people, I shall be fair and judicious and wise.
[244:26.52]How so, you ask?
[244:27.84]No, I don't want to do a YouTube survey.
[244:29.30]I know these people.
[244:31.12]I know this land.
[244:32.82]In short, I can make them better.
[244:37.46]It must be pleasant to be a man so at one with his destiny.
[244:41.40]I don't do it for myself, John Marston.
[244:43.45]I do it for my people.
[244:46.15]Well, exactly.
[244:51.60]Sarcasm, my friend, should be beneath a man such as you.
[244:55.92]Don't you think?
[244:57.12]Very little is beneath a man such as me.
[245:00.26]Okay, well, in that case, I assume a little robbery will be a pleasant day's work.
[245:06.72]All in a good cause, of course.
[245:09.01]Come, my bro.
[245:10.53]Let us strike while the iron is hot.
[245:19.09]Follow me.
[245:19.87]We must hurry.
[245:22.72]I hear typing.
[245:24.90]I'm trying to find this.
[245:30.17]This might be actually it.
[245:35.23]Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[245:37.27]Don't fail this.
[245:42.80]Okay.
[245:50.29]I think I may have found it.
[245:51.24]I'll pump it in here.
[245:52.10]Good thing Raze goes really, really slow.
[245:53.54]That's my super secret move.
[245:54.84]The spit in face.
[246:14.27]Williamson and Escuela.
[246:16.31]I'm not sure exactly where they are definitely amazing.
[246:20.39]That much I know already.
[246:22.49]You told me you found them.
[246:23.89]And I will.
[246:24.97]I have my very best man working on them.
[246:27.58]But I find out you're lying to me.
[246:29.16]Oh, watch what you're writing.
[246:31.40]You'll really see the man I used to be.
[246:34.34]I will give you your friends, I promise.
[246:36.80]Just give me time.
[246:42.55]So how did you meet these Williamson and Escuega?
[246:45.19]This one's with 50,000 notes being played at the same time.
[246:48.18]Alright, I'm gonna have to check this out.
[246:50.80]Lost, angry, and forgotten.
[246:53.77]He kind of saved me.
[246:55.03]And turned you into criminals.
[246:56.71]Dutch didn't see us that way.
[246:58.57]I'll give it a shot.
[246:59.17]We robbed banks, stole from the rich, and we gave the money to people who needed it more.
[247:04.80]Thank you, Moo, for the... It's called Black Midi.
[247:08.70]It's a million notes being played.
[247:10.50]Okay, well, I'll look it up and see.
[247:13.48]Is it a fucking million from Super Mario Brothers?
[247:15.26]Is that what this is?
[247:15.80]Because I see this in my search right now.
[247:17.02]It's like right here.
[247:17.75]I got it.
[247:18.11]I think I opened it.
[247:20.15]I opened this one already.
[247:21.17]Alright, we'll check it out.
[247:43.33]You have quite a story, John Marston.
[247:45.57]I really am a little jealous.
[247:47.31]Jealous?
[247:48.05]Of his poder potential, I mean.
[247:50.19]He would make an excellent corrido.
[247:52.27]A bullfight?
[247:53.31]No, mi hermano.
[247:54.93]That is a corrida.
[247:56.53]No, a corrido is as Mexican as Mexico itself.
[248:00.12]It sure is.
[248:01.98]A story, a ballet, a musical tribute to a heroic man.
[248:08.36]We're going pretty far out right now.
[248:13.86]In a country where most people cannot read the newspaper, song is a powerful means of communication.
[248:19.97]We do what we can to battle the lies and propaganda of the government.
[248:24.37]I know.
[248:25.41]I've seen your posters.
[248:26.91]My volume?
[248:28.05]What do you mean volume?
[248:29.94]How's that?
[248:30.48]Finally, the people have the truth.
[248:38.46]That better?
[248:44.60]Yeah, I gotta get a mixer because this microphone, the thing I currently use sucks total asshole.
[248:50.06]I would never recommend this product.
[248:53.12]It's a Focusrite Scarlett Solo.
[248:55.54]Avoid like the fucking plague.
[248:58.35]That's a very specific example, Abraham.
[249:14.91]that's why you don't buy off-brand I mean is it focused right like supposed to be a good brand they told us sanchez was making things better here not far now we must hurry the train will be leaving
[249:30.69]Well, let's go.
[249:32.01]If you want to hurry, then hurry.
[249:32.85]Let's go.
[249:33.33]Hurry up, then.
[249:34.51]Stop talking.
[249:35.07]Jump onto the train.
[249:35.77]No.
[249:36.01]I would.
[249:36.83]If this wasn't a mission, we had to sit here and listen.
[249:40.40]I would.
[249:41.08]Alright, let's go.
[249:41.94]We're good.
[249:43.02]We're good.
[249:44.20]Everything's fine.
[250:00.05]And for a train robbery?
[250:00.91]Cool.
[250:01.65]I like train robberies.
[250:08.10]Local streamer yells into an asshole.
[250:10.40]What?
[250:11.96]Thank you, Moo.
[250:16.06]This is a stealth mission.
[250:17.62]Huh?
[250:29.90]Am I playing this on console?
[250:31.08]It's only on console.
[250:32.68]So, yes.
[250:32.90]Am I going to TwitchCon?
[250:34.22]I am going to TwitchCon this year.
[250:36.10]I'll be there the whole time.
[250:39.03]All three days.
[251:02.65]Oh, he secured a distraction.
[251:03.83]You got it.
[251:06.43]Wait for the distraction.
[251:09.01]Okay.
[251:12.41]Sneak onto the train.
[251:14.60]Use throwing knives to kill guards without alerting anybody.
[251:17.62]Throwing knife.
[251:19.78]Finally, I get throwing knives.
[251:21.58]It's been too long.
[251:27.33]Are they in the door?
[251:44.57]That guy dead?
[251:50.48]Okay.
[251:50.70]So you have to arc these.
[251:54.58]Where's the last guy?
[251:57.10]Okay, we're good.
[252:08.45]We're good.
[252:09.45]Didn't get spotted.
[252:11.45]That guy heard something, but he didn't see me.
[252:19.13]We made it.
[252:26.18]I did it.
[252:27.58]Let me take out the guards.
[252:28.56]What?
[252:36.46]Are they in here?
[252:42.05]If I open this door, am I going to get seen?
[252:51.03]Huh, there's nobody here.
[252:51.93]They're all upstairs?
[252:52.61]I don't know.
[253:04.09]Actually, wait, what do you mean actually blind?
[253:06.19]Is there a guy there?
[253:08.54]Oh, he's right there.
[253:09.34]He's sitting down.
[253:10.62]How did he not see me before?
[253:18.66]These things suck!
[253:22.53]These things are the worst!
[253:27.75]Why would you ever use these?
[253:31.29]What the fuck would you use these for?
[253:34.11]These things are the fucking worst item!
[253:42.16]What the fuck?
[253:48.90]Wait, I have to be like... I could throw a knife further than this.
[253:58.93]I think I was mid-piss.
[254:00.01]Okay.
[254:07.13]Okay.
[254:09.25]Get those guys, too.
[254:10.14]Oh, come on.
[254:16.18]Where's the other one?
[254:16.82]There's one more guy.
[254:18.84]Where is he?
[254:28.33]Okay, if John Marston can throw a fucking, like, bottle further than that.
[254:37.81]That's tiny.
[254:38.81]I could throw that so much further.
[254:40.09]You guys know it.
[254:45.14]What does he want me to do?
[254:45.76]Attach the car.
[254:49.58]Do I have to get on this?
[255:02.38]Take control of the Gatling gun.
[255:03.58]Okay.
[255:08.46]Okay.
[255:08.66]You know... Okay.
[255:12.05]That's... That's fucking fantastic.
[255:14.55]So is that.
[255:17.39]Glad you were able to get on the train.
[255:18.65]I have the Gatling gun.
[255:31.45]Take out the guards.
[255:34.00]I'll take the guy out that's at the Gatling gun first.
[255:41.09]Probably be smart.
[255:53.91]Don't you dodge me.
[255:55.36]Don't do it.
[256:07.01]Oh, the fires.
[256:08.47]Watch out for the fires.
[256:18.66]More?
[256:23.79]What am I waiting for here?
[256:29.17]Hello?
[256:29.85]What is going on here?
[256:45.75]Like.
[256:47.15]Alright.
[256:50.83]Easy enough, I guess.
[256:58.29]We'll control the car.
[257:00.25]If that killed me, I was supposed to be very upset.
[257:02.49]I could throw a fire bomb.
[257:08.71]Yeah.
[257:11.11]I could.
[257:15.41]Just go.
[257:15.91]Get on it.
[257:19.71]Pull the brake lever to steal the train.
[257:22.87]Train stolen.
[257:33.89]Congratulations.
[257:38.75]Sixer has maximum style points.
[257:41.71]Yeah, it does.
[257:52.30]Hooray.
[257:55.80]Pulling up into the station.
[257:56.82]Hello.
[257:59.95]It's me.
[258:02.26]This is you guys.
[258:02.76]This is you guys cheering for me right now.
[258:05.52]Plant the dynamite in the armored car?
[258:08.32]Interesting.
[258:09.34]Excuse me.
[258:38.05]Get in the tank.
[258:41.51]Are the people still in here?
[258:47.73]Alright.
[258:49.35]Do I have to, like, run?
[258:54.54]Yes, I do.
[258:55.14]Okay.
[258:58.58]Okay.
[259:02.55]Do I have to drop down and kill the last people in there?
[259:06.81]There's probably a guy in here.
[259:20.68]There was.
[259:24.45]Safe.
[259:25.23]Look at that.
[259:26.19]Can I open the safe and take everything and just say there was nothing in it?
[259:41.36]More this way.
[259:51.63]Got it.
[259:55.22]What's in the fridge?
[259:58.42]Couple of... Couple of sacks of dough.
[260:01.92]Cool.
[260:06.40]Am I going to finish this on stream?
[260:07.96]Yeah, I'm going to complete Red Dead Redemption on stream.
[260:10.76]Yes.
[260:12.30]On stream.
[260:15.92]There's a gun in there too.
[260:17.12]Wow, 200 bucks.
[260:20.52]What was the gun?
[260:21.06]Was it just ammo?
[260:26.60]I don't get to keep all that, do I?
[260:40.85]I probably have to split it.
[260:49.46]But we're not going to play this tomorrow.
[260:51.34]We're going to take a break from Red Dead tomorrow.
[260:53.38]We're going to do PSVR tomorrow.
[260:55.68]We will go back to Red Dead this weekend.
[261:02.05]I'm going to do another stream this weekend.
[261:04.53]We're going to do an extra stream.
[261:06.87]See how far we can get on probably Sunday.
[261:12.22]And then we'll see what's up after that.
[261:16.78]There's a lot of like PSVR games that we've not played.
[261:21.24]I want to play Bridge Crew.
[261:23.22]That's at least one of them I've seen that.
[261:24.67]I want to play that.
[261:30.73]There's a couple other like PSVR exclusives that came out.
[261:33.31]That might be funny.
[261:35.85]Might be fun.
[261:42.90]Alright.
[261:43.82]Again.
[261:47.33]And this stream... I'm going to say... I'm going to do this mission here and see where we're at.
[261:59.41]I'm just going to fast travel, actually.
[262:08.63]After this mission, I think I might call it for tonight.
[262:12.09]Looks like we did plenty of stuff in Mexico.
[262:20.10]Where did I want to go?
[262:20.72]Escalera, right?
[262:30.88]Oh, that's right.
[262:32.44]The piano song.
[262:33.99]Yes, I will have it ready.
[262:39.79]I got it.
[262:40.17]Here it is.
[262:45.21]I almost GTA'd that guy.
[262:55.90]Come on, let's go!
[263:03.68]Fast travel to the waypoint?
[263:05.02]Yeah, I can do that, you're right.
[263:09.01]Come on, horse.
[263:09.91]Come on.
[263:11.87]I know you got it in you.
[263:12.99]I do.
[263:13.27]Don't make me have to do this the right way.
[263:16.03]I have to do it the right way.
[263:20.51]Fucking video game.
[263:22.60]Fucking video games.
[263:34.85]At least I got it.
[263:41.67]I was trying to kill that guy.
[263:42.67]I'm not going to lie.
[263:43.71]That guy was... I was trying to murder him.
[263:54.26]Cross, and there it is.
[263:56.52]Don't fucking seriously...
[264:10.27]This horse is fast as fuck, it is.
[264:11.69]It is very, very fast.
[264:22.71]I'm still using the warhorse, right?
[264:28.35]I think I...
[264:39.94]Full Jupiter.
[264:42.09]Another one.
[264:42.53]Meet the sheriff with a broken wagon.
[264:44.33]Is that already on a mission?
[264:46.73]Why?
[264:52.40]What in the name of gravy?
[264:54.34]Alright, lightning.
[264:58.02]You're going to have to take a backseat here for a second.
[265:08.51]Is this a second double cross?
[265:11.37]We're gonna get double double crossed?
[265:15.23]That's not cool.
[265:15.91]Alright, I gotta go up.
[265:24.21]Is this guy right here?
[265:24.95]Where the fuck is he?
[265:33.17]Another guy, another guy.
[265:34.05]Anybody, anybody.
[265:35.49]Shoot the cross, whatever.
[265:44.58]Uh, one guy there.
[265:50.32]Shoot the one guy this friend is watching for no reason.
[265:54.13]One guy left over there.
[265:57.21]Peek.
[265:57.73]Peek.
[265:58.09]Peek.
[265:58.39]Peek.
[265:58.95]Peek.
[265:59.23]Peek.
[265:59.49]Peek.
[265:59.77]Peek.
[266:00.69]Peek.
[266:03.27]Still alive?
[266:07.27]He is.
[266:07.81]He's still alive.
[266:10.87]Okay, no.
[266:11.31]Now he's dead.
[266:14.84]I'm gonna throw a Molotov in there.
[266:20.82]We have to Molotov this guy.
[266:21.92]That's like the... Fire bottle.
[266:25.02]No, we're dynamiting him.
[266:27.26]I don't even know how this works.
[266:30.11]Alright, it's going in.
[266:30.67]It's going in this right here.
[266:34.31]No, wait, wait, wait, wait a second!
[266:42.23]What?
[266:42.35]I lit it.
[266:42.69]I lit the thing.
[266:43.25]I lit it.
[266:49.25]Okay.
[266:50.09]No dynamite.
[266:50.71]We're not gonna use dynamite right now.
[266:52.31]Dynamite's a little too dangerous.
[266:57.45]Who the fuck is this guy?
[266:58.63]I wanted to get style points.
[267:12.59]I'm not even in here.
[267:15.99]The guy's not even inside of this building.
[267:22.70]He's in there.
[267:23.12]Okay, this is gonna be perfect.
[267:24.80]Perfect.
[267:26.50]Just gotta sneak something in there.
[267:30.50]Right there.
[267:31.22]Perfect.
[267:31.78]He's not even gonna fucking see it coming.
[267:42.80]What happened?
[267:49.80]Why did I get minus 50 honor?
[267:56.87]Okay, well... What?
[268:01.01]I'll take it.
[268:04.18]Wait, there was a good guy in there that I was supposed to save?
[268:06.50]Oh.
[268:11.91]Well... Uh... Collateral damage.
[268:17.74]Outposts deliberated.
[268:27.86]Minus 50 honor, plus 100 honor.
[268:28.76]Come on, what?
[268:43.52]I want to see this again.
[268:44.30]I want to see that funny joke again.
[268:47.82]No, they're not moving fast enough.
[268:48.88]Who cares?
[268:57.25]Follow me!
[268:57.77]Dude, Deadeye with the dynamite?
[269:03.91]It's just going to explode.
[269:04.99]It's not going to do anything.
[269:13.00]Use dynamite, you nerd.
[269:14.24]Hey!
[269:15.02]Excuse me.
[269:15.48]Did somebody just shoot me?
[269:23.02]Why does it hurt my horse?
[269:30.65]Where are you guys going?
[269:41.16]I didn't even know I fucking had to get... Come on!
[269:53.16]Those things just jump up on you so quickly.
[269:59.20]And they just instantly kill you.
[270:00.96]Like, I...
[270:03.82]What the fuck were you trying to do?
[270:04.98]I had my molotovs out.
[270:06.64]I would have shot him, but I had my fucking molotovs equipped.
[270:09.68]I rode into a random scene and instantly died.
[270:17.42]Oh, for the love of fucking God, don't even tell me.
[270:21.40]Alright, I'm just fucking teleporting to my waypoint.
[270:27.06]Somebody please help me!
[270:28.94]You're dead!
[270:29.32]Fucking go.
[270:39.24]That guy got a stick?
[270:44.55]What's the guy have a stick for?
[270:45.43]Is he gonna hit me with- Oh, he's playing with the dog!
[270:50.59]Okay, well that's cool.
[270:54.36]I didn't know you could play with dogs.
[270:56.46]Does he bring it back?
[270:57.06]Alright, bring it back and do it again.
[271:00.22]Can I do it?
[271:02.80]Let me see, let me do it.
[271:04.00]Can I do it?
[271:05.20]I wanna play with the dog.
[271:13.72]I want to play with the dog.
[271:15.26]It should be my turn.
[271:22.41]Whoa!
[271:22.75]His dog actually fights you!
[271:25.13]Why?
[271:25.95]Wait, hold on.
[271:27.29]The dog actually fights you?
[271:29.03]Because I pushed his master.
[271:31.53]Alright, I'll lose the dog.
[271:37.90]Don't worry.
[271:44.93]Come on, leave me alone.
[271:46.13]How far do you have to run?
[271:47.15]You don't have to follow me this far.
[271:49.87]It wasn't a big deal.
[271:52.61]I bumped into the guy.
[271:54.21]Sorry.
[271:54.65]I wonder how far does he follow you?
[272:01.20]Looks like you don't follow that far.
[272:02.50]Maybe you do.
[272:07.74]What?
[272:09.24]He's still going.
[272:11.58]You're gonna follow me to the ends of the Earth, dog?
[272:14.74]Unwise.
[272:20.46]Don't you want to check on your master to make sure?
[272:22.38]And now we've got a train.
[272:24.16]And now we've got the train.
[272:25.91]So, I mean, you guys know what's going to happen here, right?
[272:30.73]How long is this going to take?
[272:35.99]Don't keep following me.
[272:38.78]This is bad news for you, dog.
[272:42.76]Really, get away from me.
[272:46.64]He's gonna end up killing me because like I had to scratch my fucking dirty itchy ass greasy face.
[272:54.39]Can I tie the dog up?
[273:01.23]I can't believe he follows you this far.
[273:05.14]For a second I thought he was gonna get picked up by an eagle.
[273:10.24]He's cutting me off.
[273:10.98]He's doing like a GTA cop move.
[273:15.03]Get the fuck away from me.
[273:18.27]He's going faster.
[273:22.24]He's actually going faster.
[273:23.84]Where's my horse?
[273:37.13]Come on.
[273:46.31]Come on.
[273:48.15]Keep going.
[273:55.41]He's faster than a horse.
[273:57.44]Yeah, not faster than a horse.
[274:00.48]And the dog whistles and the dog gets on a horse.
[274:03.04]Skunk!
[274:03.64]Skunk!
[274:04.90]Oh.
[274:05.66]Wait, he's going after a butterfly?
[274:10.65]I'm not going to hurt the dog.
[274:12.05]The train is going to hurt the dog, guys.
[274:13.71]There's a difference.
[274:19.62]No, this is gonna take a thousand years.
[274:21.16]I gotta lose him.
[274:24.52]I'm just gonna lose him.
[274:25.80]Come on.
[274:26.12]Come over here.
[274:29.73]Yep.
[274:32.21]Good luck to you, dog.
[274:34.31]Say a prayer for the dog, everybody.
[274:39.65]Say your prayers.
[274:41.03]Because we're going over a cliff.
[274:45.36]Right over here.
[274:49.05]Okay, bye dog.
[274:53.99]Oh, nice clip.
[274:57.67]Ugh, now there's another person that wants my help.
[275:03.74]What is it?
[275:07.04]The dog is still fucking following me over here.
[275:12.51]Surrender to the robbers, press B. What?
[275:19.84]Good job, Tom.
[275:44.80]The dog set me up.
[275:45.98]I don't know.
[275:46.36]Whatever.
[275:46.66]I'm just fucking... I'm just messing around.
[275:50.54]The dog provoked him, but they didn't shoot the dog.
[275:52.80]They shot me instead.
[275:56.89]Alright.
[275:57.37]We're doing this mission, and then we're done.
[276:02.07]I'm going to bed.
[276:02.97]I'm going to play PSVR tomorrow.
[276:04.95]It'll be fun.
[276:05.65]It's going to be a fun time.
[276:14.03]Travel to waypoint.
[276:19.69]Too close to the settlement.
[276:21.23]Okie dokie.
[276:23.48]How about now?
[276:28.70]Travel to waypoint, please.
[276:36.32]Travel to destination.
[276:38.67]Travel to waypoint.
[276:41.53]Alright, this is the last, the last thing we're going to do before the stream ends.
[276:52.77]Here we go.
[276:58.26]Father Abraham.
[276:59.26]Hey, Señor.
[277:03.48]You want trouble, friend?
[277:12.58]There's the piano.
[277:13.30]Okay, I'm done.
[277:15.51]Time to play the game.
[277:17.59]The dog fast travels, too.
[277:39.82]It's strangely fitting.
[277:41.10]Why are they holding guns at me?
[277:45.05]I'm hungry.
[277:45.91]What am I going to eat?
[277:47.59]Hot dogs.
[277:47.81]I'm going to have three hot dogs.
[278:01.52]Mr. Marston, my father was killed yesterday.
[278:05.80]The army found him and accused him of treason.
[278:08.81]They cut out his heart and fed it to their dogs.
[278:11.09]Alright.
[278:12.19]Allende did this.
[278:13.69]Then he took the honor of two young girls.
[278:17.43]I'm sorry to hear that, Louisa.
[278:20.31]My father must not die in vain.
[278:22.40]His death must mean something.
[278:24.95]It'll mean that war is brutal and unnecessary and good people die.
[278:28.61]And that's all it will mean.
[278:31.77]That is not enough.
[278:32.43]He's talking about war.
[278:33.43]War is hell, you know?
[278:34.91]You know I'll do whatever I can, but I have problems of my own.
[278:38.54]We all have problems.
[278:40.20]This is about the people.
[278:41.28]My father died for his people.
[278:42.88]Wait, where's the poncho?
[278:43.66]You're right.
[278:44.12]For these men and for millions like them that they may be free.
[278:48.24]While there are guns and money, there won't be any freedom.
[278:51.46]How come it's, I changed my clothes?
[278:53.76]Mr. Marston, the movement is on the brink of great victory.
[278:57.74]Allende knows this and has sent for reinforcements.
[279:02.24]Abram Reyes asked personally that you stop them reaching Escalera.
[279:07.52]They're coming by the old trail.
[279:09.66]You must ambush them.
[279:11.52]I have my own family.
[279:12.52]Do I finally get to ambush somebody?
[279:13.68]I don't get ambushed?
[279:14.36]Mr. Marston, I have lost my father.
[279:17.87]My mother is in the United States.
[279:20.05]My sister has fled.
[279:21.19]I have no family.
[279:23.27]Just because.
[279:25.67]Please.
[279:27.33]Good actions make you a good man.
[279:30.11]Then I'm doomed.
[279:33.78]But I will help you.
[279:35.50]Out of respect for your loss.
[279:38.08]Alright.
[279:39.20]Am I just hiding in the bush?
[279:45.13]Ambush the ambush.
[279:45.77]Ambush the ambush.
[280:04.81]I really hope this isn't another we drive away while we get attacked by people on horseback.
[280:08.17]Come on.
[280:08.87]It is not for now.
[280:10.15]The army, if you are going to shoot me, shoot me.
[280:13.50]We going to steal their supplies?
[280:17.30]No, destroy them and kill everyone.
[280:20.26]Abraham wants to send a message.
[280:22.46]You have experience.
[280:23.74]You make up your mind.
[280:29.53]What purpose did that serve?
[280:39.66]Yeah, it is kind of actually.
[280:42.60]It is kind of a joke to me.
[280:43.64]Is this a joke?
[280:51.51]Yeah, I guess.
[280:57.46]For what purpose?
[280:59.54]I'm doing a live stream, don't you understand?
[281:01.28]It's for that.
[281:01.78]This guy's a double-fisting dynamite.
[281:03.16]Everyone is.
[281:04.28]I need to know.
[281:04.74]Ha ha ha!
[281:04.98]Ha ha ha!
[281:34.61]Alright, where do we place the dynamite, boys and girls?
[281:42.30]Two's explosive?
[281:43.04]What do I mean, two's explosive location?
[281:45.30]Right here?
[281:45.72]Put it right here.
[281:50.82]Okay, how about over here?
[281:57.04]Put one here.
[282:10.41]Are you sure you want them so close to each other?
[282:12.79]This is good.
[282:14.55]Another one here.
[282:16.37]Set the last one here.
[282:18.13]Good.
[282:18.71]Now go.
[282:19.53]Luisa is waiting for you at the top of the hill.
[282:27.13]Okay, there's a lot of these here.
[282:30.71]You guys are doing a great job.
[282:33.79]Okay, let's go to the detonator.
[282:37.53]Funny, funny, funny, funny.
[282:42.73]what a meme no what a funny joke I think it's still gonna be fine don't get mad this is the last mission anyways good I am glad you are here to help us I tried I just tried to push her off the edge I'm not gonna lie I just tried to push her ready the detonator these are supplies to be used against my people they must be destroyed there it is get ready
[283:15.17]Where are the dynamite?
[283:16.05]Where's the dynamite?
[283:21.01]Oh, they're all on the right.
[283:21.67]They're alright there anyways.
[283:22.74]Okay, so whatever.
[283:38.29]Is this a bad joke incoming?
[283:42.80]I mean, I don't know.
[283:43.66]This might... Tell me if this is gonna be like a bad joke.
[283:55.00]Wait till the big thing gets over there.
[284:10.19]They didn't even go across.
[284:11.63]Wait, what do you mean they're getting away?
[284:13.35]They didn't even go across.
[284:16.08]What is happening right now?
[284:22.10]I couldn't even fucking detonate it?
[284:32.35]Why couldn't I even... They can't go that far.
[284:37.84]Alright, that's... Okay.
[284:40.44]I didn't even get to detonate, so I have to go, like, all the way up here.
[284:42.56]This is dumb.
[284:44.76]She just, like, screamed for no reason.
[284:50.86]Put one here.
[284:54.63]What?
[284:59.23]Put one right here.
[284:59.77]Okay, then put another one, like, here.
[285:07.51]Another one here.
[285:11.07]One here.
[285:12.13]Here.
[285:14.07]Put one here.
[285:15.03]Here's good.
[285:15.59]Put one here.
[285:17.08]And the last one here.
[285:19.44]Alright, whatever.
[285:20.10]That wouldn't be nice.
[285:36.50]What do you see in those binoculars?
[285:37.78]Here they come.
[285:39.24]Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[285:40.98]Uh, switch explosive.
[285:42.44]This is the first one.
[285:45.76]There's the first one right there.
[286:06.15]So I'm going to wait till they're over everything and blow them all or go 1, 2, 3, 4, I guess.
[286:10.79]I guess.
[286:15.07]They're probably... Wait, they're going to notice me.
[286:18.00]Maybe I should have gone all the way down the road.
[286:24.42]I don't know.
[286:25.02]As long as it works, I don't fucking care.
[286:40.63]If she would just shut up.
[286:52.38]You know what I mean?
[287:01.93]If she would just...
[287:09.83]She would just stop screaming.
[287:10.85]I would have just died there.
[287:11.91]Alright, that was easy.
[287:12.43]One more mission?
[287:12.87]Fine.
[287:43.60]Last mission of the night.
[287:50.74]The final mission.
[288:04.33]Good streamer extends the stream.
[288:08.94]Sometimes he does.
[288:10.08]Sometimes he ends it early.
[288:17.42]That's some good streamer karma.
[288:19.08]That's right.
[288:19.68]You're right.
[288:20.00]I think, uh, is it too late to do this?
[288:36.83]Chat remains in balance.
[288:40.07]I mean, hold on a minute, though.
[288:41.15]Like, let's be real.
[288:45.76]Like, don't I have to know if this is possible?
[289:01.29]I guess it's possible.
[289:05.39]I just want to know if it was possible.
[289:16.48]Answer?
[289:16.98]Yes, it is possible.
[289:25.71]Look, it looks pretty possible.
[289:30.54]Picks a sniper.
[289:31.42]I don't know.
[289:31.92]I was just picking a random gun.
[289:46.13]Alright, let's end the stream with a bang, huh?
[289:52.65]Slightly possible.
[289:58.96]What is that?
[289:59.34]Is that a fucking, like, tiger?
[290:15.80]What the fuck was that?
[290:21.14]I tried.
[290:21.54]I just hit right trigger.
[290:30.15]I legit just tried to kill her.
[290:37.33]Don't aggro the cougar.
[290:40.07]A mountain lion.
[290:40.92]This game's great.
[290:41.60]Is she gonna ride too?
[290:43.14]Maybe the Santa can tell you where to find Javieres.
[291:16.10]You are just getting missed, by the way.
[291:19.33]How?
[291:20.73]Oh my god.
[291:21.51]Are you telling me none of those bullets could graze her and hit her in the fucking head?
[291:23.93]No, no dynamite.
[291:42.64]She was dodging and weaving those bullets really well.
[291:47.17]Quantum suicide theory in action.
[291:55.38]Local PC gamer uses thumbsticks.
[291:57.04]No, Etalyx, actually you can't shoot that NPC.
[291:59.84]She's untargetable.
[292:01.50]I was trying to have her lean into a bullet and have it hit her right in the face.
[292:05.23]That's what I was trying to do.
[292:07.01]Get with the program.
[292:19.62]Alright, I made it back.
[292:22.80]Am I going crazy?
[292:29.38]Mad because bad?
[292:30.12]No, you physically can't shoot NPCs.
[292:32.08]What are you talking about?
[292:35.43]Mad because bad?
[292:36.39]Yeah, because I can't physically aim at that person.
[292:41.69]Don't test me.
[292:42.23]I'll drop a Molotov on this whole team here.
[292:45.07]Don't test me.
[292:47.35]That's a pretty good transformation.
[292:49.15]Won't do it.
[292:49.53]Do it.
[292:49.69]Won't do it.
[292:50.19]No, I'm not doing it.
[293:16.16]I have to capture this guy.
[293:18.42]No killing.
[293:23.04]Do not kill DeSanto.
[293:34.01]Am I using a sniper rifle right now?
[293:41.69]To do things like this.
[293:48.63]Like that.
[293:48.97]Come on.
[293:51.37]Alright, now I'm going to take the sniper rifle out and go to the semi-automatic to stab.
[294:03.14]They don't kill him, so I'm going to isolate him.
[294:12.44]And which one is he?
[294:13.32]There's like three people over here.
[294:14.70]Which one is he?
[294:16.62]Oh, he's running.
[294:17.18]Oh shit, he's getting away.
[294:28.01]Come here, you son of a bitch.
[294:33.39]Please don't die from that.
[294:34.31]Got him.
[294:37.75]Got him.
[294:40.47]There's one more guy alive up there, and he's kind of freaking me out that no one's killed him.
[294:51.85]My Ming will kill you!
[294:58.57]It actually worked out.
[294:59.49]Yeah, it did.
[295:00.55]Yeah, it did.
[295:03.17]Let's go, shall we?
[295:05.41]If you kill me, we'll have the entire Mexican army after you!
[295:07.93]Gotta hit him in the foot.
[295:09.91]This one guy is concerning me, though.
[295:11.81]I don't want him to shoot at me and hit this guy.
[295:13.73]Uh, you're the Winchester repeater.
[295:17.63]Freeze!
[295:17.83]We can come to an agreement.
[295:20.38]Where is he?
[295:20.78]He's like in the bush.
[295:22.36]Where is he?
[295:25.30]He's right there.
[295:30.96]Good work.
[295:33.21]Nice work, dude.
[295:39.07]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[295:41.13]Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back, come back.
[295:44.59]Come back, please.
[295:48.08]I thought the mission was going to just end when I got here.
[295:51.48]Okay.
[295:51.60]Take him off the horse.
[295:58.38]I know you can jump.
[295:59.08]You can jump.
[295:59.74]Yeah, you can jump real well.
[296:01.08]You can jump really well.
[296:03.32]But please hit X and take him off horse.
[296:09.27]You fucking stupid horse.
[296:12.51]Come.
[296:13.83]Just give him to me.
[296:15.05]Just give him to me.
[296:17.71]Okay.
[296:19.25]Just give him to me.
[296:27.01]Here's your fucking bounty!
[296:28.63]My goodness.
[296:37.72]I always have my hand hurts.
[296:41.50]Was that like a here it comes, here it comes?
[296:42.86]Or was that my hand hurts?
[296:43.87]Pretty good acting.
[296:59.02]Kill me or let me go.
[297:01.54]He just did my special move.
[297:08.15]I just did my fucking special move.
[297:10.89]We got a choice here.
[297:32.44]Taking this guy for a fucking ride.
[297:43.86]Coming with me.
[297:44.36]I am making the decision.
[297:49.89]He's coming with me for a ride.
[297:51.09]Come on.
[298:02.55]Oh, sorry about this!
[298:09.71]How far away am I gonna get?
[298:11.05]Let's go.
[298:12.01]We're gonna go off like a bucket.
[298:13.11]We're taking him off like a cliff.
[298:15.98]We're going all the way up here.
[298:17.12]Can he make it?
[298:17.92]Can the horse make it?
[298:21.62]Just leave me here?
[298:22.60]No, I gotta get him all the way up this thing.
[298:26.44]Take him to the train?
[298:27.72]That's a long ways away.
[298:30.12]Just get him up here.
[298:35.63]There we go.
[298:41.13]Now let's take him for a ride.
[298:45.44]He's like- he's like doing tricks.
[298:52.38]This is cruel.
[299:06.18]Uh, how much... I know.
[299:09.40]What a better man.
[299:10.20]I think we're... Okay, I got him on the train.
[299:13.16]Where's the train?
[299:15.22]Let's get him run over by the train.
[299:18.44]What?
[299:21.82]Oh.
[299:23.93]Oh, what?
[299:27.05]Did I hit his head on the metal and it killed him?
[299:32.63]Oh, goddammit.
[299:33.21]I must have smashed his head on the metal.
[299:37.00]What is this guy talking about?
[299:38.60]We do, though.
[299:38.94]I hope this guy comes over here.
[299:40.24]Come over to me.
[299:40.66]Just move over here a little.
[299:41.78]It's very important.
[300:08.38]Come over this way and just stand right on the track.
[300:11.46]Talk to me.
[300:11.98]Teach me.
[300:14.00]Teach me what I should be doing.
[300:16.84]And do that by standing still on the track.
[300:20.53]He's not going to do it, is he?
[300:23.91]No, he's not.
[300:28.66]Isn't he going the wrong way?

[302:04.10]Horse, get the fuck out of the way.
[302:07.93]No, those aren't bad guys.
[302:09.15]Those are just people running out because they're fearing their safety.
[302:11.57]Okay, okay, okay.
[302:18.84]I just like the firework for that guy.
[302:21.60]Why do I want to shoot these people so bad?
[302:28.59]I want to like kill... I shot that door.
[302:30.45]The door opened because I shot it so bad.
[302:32.31]Got it.
[302:41.35]Who you boys steal their uniforms off?
[302:48.77]Alright, where is he?
[302:59.16]Hey, you, lady.
[303:00.78]Where's Javier Escuela?
[303:02.70]Javier Escuela?
[303:04.56]He hasn't been seen around here in months.
[303:07.40]You shot up this place for him, huh?
[303:10.22]I wouldn't spit on him if he was on fire.
[303:12.20]I don't blame you.
[303:13.80]But Captain DeSantis said he was here.
[303:16.62]And you believe him?
[303:18.15]You must be more stupid than you look.
[303:21.56]Go shoot up some play sauce.
[303:23.92]That was disgusting.
[303:29.92]You came in here to start dancing?
[303:45.96]There's nobody in here.
[303:46.78]This girl is just fucked.
[303:57.37]What?
[303:57.83]Oh, shit.
[303:58.67]Okay.
[303:59.03]Whoops.
[304:07.47]We're fine.
[304:18.85]R is right here.
[304:19.79]I'm gonna try to do a shortcut.
[304:28.46]And end stream.
[304:31.48]This one's right here.
[304:41.62]I know, I'm getting the one more mission vibe from this game.
[304:45.16]I could go up there, but I don't want to right now.
[304:48.18]One more for you guys, for sure.
[304:50.47]For you guys.
[304:53.35]Extended.
[304:54.29]We keep extending the screen.
[304:57.97]I hope this is not a clip that just drops off right here, except I think there is.
[305:00.98]Of course there is.
[305:02.34]It's right there.
[305:05.18]I don't know, like a parachute or something.
[305:06.68]I think I can do it.
[305:07.66]I really do.
[305:08.92]I can do it.
[305:10.52]Don't tell me I can't, because I know I can.
[305:12.08]I just have to go right there.
[305:20.17]So far so good.
[305:22.45]Just wait till we recharge our health.
[305:34.94]We're good.
[305:36.32]We're okay.
[305:40.30]The game wanted me to die.
[305:42.42]But I'm still alive.
[305:44.88]There's another little drop right here.
[305:51.77]This way.
[305:54.39]Okay, good.
[305:54.97]Got it.
[305:56.41]Wrap around to the left.
[305:57.07]Is somebody shooting me with a sniper rifle?
[306:03.70]Perfect spot right here.
[306:05.82]Ride the wave.
[306:07.66]Got it.
[306:12.08]Not much further.
[306:27.85]And we have made it to the mission.
[306:36.30]The gates of El Presidio.
[306:39.20]Presidio.
[306:59.32]Get up, dude.
[307:00.10]It's long enough.
[307:01.10]Wait, wait, wait.
[307:04.60]Got it.
[307:05.40]I got it.
[307:09.06]I got it.
[307:09.56]Got it.
[307:17.10]Let me tell you something I strongly recommend you take her when you
[307:39.76]Literally nothing says there.
[307:42.02]You were warned.
[307:45.00]That's why I was ready.
[307:46.50]You didn't think I was ready right there?
[307:48.26]That was me being ready.
[307:49.90]Had to do one more.
[308:00.37]I should have just played that.
[308:01.29]I should have played that while it was happening.
[308:04.07]That was a mistake.
[308:05.21]Interesting.
[308:26.98]How did he put his penis away so fast?
[308:29.12]I don't know, because he pulled it in and zipped.
[308:36.70]Well, I had it up there earlier, Sarg.
[308:39.88]It just... I didn't have it being shown on OBS.
[308:43.46]I had it, like, hidden.
[308:46.17]So I was moving it around while it was hidden.
[308:47.87]I would have been faster.
[308:48.81]Fuck this game!
[309:00.03]Alright, for a second I thought it was gonna be, like, okay.
[309:05.45]Let's go, John!
[309:06.44]Today we will both have victory!
[309:10.04]Step away from it!
[309:10.90]Step away from the fucking wagon!
[309:13.96]Oh shit!
[309:15.22]He just came up straight!
[309:18.74]Hold on!
[309:19.94]Dude, was that his body that went straight in the fucking air?
[309:26.54]Wait a minute.
[309:27.88]I need the Z for science.
[309:29.18]Holy shit.
[309:30.12]Hold on.
[309:30.56]Where does his body go?
[309:32.96]Look at his fucking body.
[309:36.07]No.
[309:40.91]This is gonna... Ah, god damn it.
[309:44.17]Stand on it and blow.
[309:45.05]Oh, that's a great idea.
[309:46.03]First thing, I'm gonna shoot one of those guys in the head first.
[309:55.04]I don't think I can climb up.
[310:00.12]Where's my horse?
[310:10.08]Come here.
[310:11.70]Come on, get up there.
[310:15.50]You can do it.
[310:16.44]Just gotta get a little speed.
[310:19.04]Oh, we're going downhill now.
[310:29.64]I don't know what's wrong with my horse.
[310:30.94]Alright, that's it.
[310:48.46]That's it.
[310:49.56]I'm done.
[310:50.58]That's it.
[310:51.46]We're done with this mission.
[310:53.62]We'll come back on fucking... Come on, mi hermano.
[310:55.90]This is the day we have all been waiting for.
[311:03.03]I see that you're already excited, my friend.
[311:05.47]Save at least one bullet for your friend out here.
[311:10.95]You sure like true rebels now, yo?
[311:13.65]I'm ready!
[311:14.37]I see these people just screaming.
[311:16.67]I see that you're already excited, my friend.
[311:19.19]Save at least one bullet.
[311:21.53]Oh, I got her!
[311:23.45]Okay, cool.
[311:24.15]Alright, see, I'll see.
[311:28.04]I'm done.
[311:28.42]I gotta, like, go get something to eat.
[311:30.84]Let's go, John.
[311:31.82]Today we will both have victory.
[311:34.42]Let's just finish the mission.
[311:35.46]Let's finish it and be done.
[311:36.36]Let's join the ride shotgun.
[311:39.32]Do I need to ride shotgun?
[311:44.16]Or can I go in one of these other cars?
[311:47.85]I guess I can't.
[311:48.87]Don't you want to go home to your family, you strange man?
[311:51.47]Last one.
[311:51.99]This is it.
[311:52.31]I'm just going to have to skip this fucking cutscene.
[311:55.77]Here we go.
[311:56.91]You guys are talking a lot.
[311:57.81]Okay, bye.
[311:59.69]We're here.
[312:02.64]Now we can just do the mission and be done.
[312:03.86]Alright guys, goodnight.
[312:38.53]Did I get you?
[312:39.21]Did I get you?
[312:43.47]Censored.
[312:45.43]Nah, I'm going back.
[312:48.18]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[312:50.28]Tomorrow is going to be PSVR.
[312:53.76]We're gonna take a break from Red Dead Redemption.
[312:57.62]We're going back to Red Dead Redemption.
[313:00.96]On Sunday, probably.
[313:05.33]So with that, I'll see you guys tomorrow for PSVR.
[313:08.65]We are in no means done with Red Dead.
[313:11.24]And I'll catch you guys later.
[313:12.28]Have a good night.
[313:13.88]Have a good rest of your time.
[313:16.14]See you later.
[313:46.73]There is no need for that, John.
[313:48.87]I am not lying to you.
[313:50.61]I see that you're already excited, my friend.
