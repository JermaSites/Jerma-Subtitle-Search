[00:09.08]Alright, what's going on everybody?
[00:10.82]It's Jerma here with BooMan61 and MLC_St3alth.
[00:15.71]Gonna be doing... Hey, I'm trying to do the intro here.
[00:20.55]Gonna be doing a live commentary on Payload Race Hoodoo.
[00:25.85]And what am I doing?
[00:26.82]I'm just like standing here.
[00:28.32]I'm playing an engineer.
[00:29.26]I'm just like standing still going like, okay, so I play this game like this.
[00:33.26]That's just like your Jerma craft where you're telling stories and building the same like tower of blocks and like taking them down.
[00:41.84]I got to move this thing.
[00:42.59]I can't stand her anymore.
[00:44.40]Did you say payload race?
[00:46.42]Did I say payload race?
[00:48.10]I think you said payload race.
[00:50.04]Maybe I did.
[00:50.66]We're here on payload race hoodoo.
[00:54.67]Is payload race where there's two of them?
[00:56.93]Yeah.
[00:57.33]That's not what this is, okay.
[00:58.93]That's not what this is.
[01:01.07]If that's what I said, then I'm totally incorrect and that's not what this is.
[01:05.59]This is on regular payload.
[01:09.44]Oh man, they're gonna... No, I got him.
[01:10.76]I got it.
[01:11.20]I got it.
[01:11.66]I'm good to go.
[01:14.11]They seem to have a lot of soldiers.
[01:18.95]Yep.
[01:19.67]Unless they get an Uber, I don't think they're gonna be able to get over here.
[01:24.40]Oh, come at me!
[01:25.92]Oh god, oh god, oh god.
[01:29.00]Oh god!
[01:30.24]Ah, I knew that was gonna happen.
[01:32.19]Is that sentry still alive?
[01:34.07]Yep.
[01:35.73]I was trying to back away from it, but I was just getting hit too hard.
[01:40.19]Boo, the floggy pyro bastard.
[01:44.79]Oh, I went in his hell of water.
[01:46.27]Whoops.
[01:46.85]I need to change my name.
[01:48.95]Oh, I just shot through that.
[01:50.89]Oh, lucky crit.
[01:52.87]Yeah, they got it.
[01:55.09]Alright.
[01:55.93]Time to go, like, real blue.
[02:00.95]Trying to get another sentry up.
[02:03.27]Come on, come on!
[02:04.05]Alright, there's another sentry sitting here.
[02:08.75]Go, go, go, go, go!
[02:09.41]That was close.
[02:14.42]Spies, Spy Pyro, Spy Pyro.
[02:17.06]Spyro.
[02:17.76]Oh, save Martin Van Buren's... We got it, we got it.
[02:20.69]Teleporter.
[02:21.35]Er, what's that called?
[02:23.55]Oh god, I don't have any ammo.
[02:24.81]I don't have any ammo.
[02:29.87]God, get this spy out of here.
[02:34.41]No, keep him off the... Keep him off the cat!
[02:38.05]No, they got it.
[02:39.81]Oh my god, it just teleported right into the middle of them all.
[02:42.01]Shit.
[02:44.65]I still- yeah, this teleporter's still up.
[02:46.97]Oh, not anymore, not anymore.
[02:48.41]It's gone.
[02:51.11]That spy.
[02:52.31]I knew it!
[02:54.21]I can smell ya!
[02:55.79]I can smell ya from a mile away.
[02:57.61]Oh, you have smell edition, too?
[02:58.40]I can smell ya getting off the elevator.
[03:00.54]Home Alone.
[03:01.06]Oh, wait, that's from- oh, Home Alone.
[03:02.74]Yeah.
[03:03.10]Oh, come on.
[03:04.12]Home Alone.
[03:05.14]I can smell ya getting off the elevator!
[03:09.94]What was it, uh... Home Alone?
[03:11.56]Phony Bab?
[03:14.16]You were smooching all over everybody.
[03:18.29]That is such a fantastic movie.
[03:20.27]And Happy New Year.
[03:22.99]What did you call him?
[03:24.57]That's a spy.
[03:25.61]Wow, we have like four snipers sitting in the back here.
[03:27.97]I just got clubbed.
[03:30.05]I got the spy.
[03:30.61]Oh, save my sentry, thank you.
[03:31.91]Marcus Van Machinery, you are... Machinery.
[03:35.25]Am I even saying that word right?
[03:39.45]For the longest time, I didn't know how to pronounce, uh, the machinist with Christian Bale.
[03:44.02]I thought it was called the mechanist, or the mikanist.
[03:47.68]The mikanist!
[03:50.16]That was a sniper up there.
[03:51.18]Mechanist.
[03:51.78]Oh my god, that guy is getting... How is that guy still up there?
[03:57.17]Yeah, he had nowhere to go.
[03:58.09]The gates closed behind him.
[04:01.09]Kind of trapped himself.
[04:02.77]Poor bugger.
[04:06.07]They're coming through the tunnels up ahead.
[04:09.76]Oh, get through there.
[04:13.50]Get this thing built.
[04:17.78]Oh, careful for the Demoman.
[04:19.00]There's a Demoman up on that top left.
[04:20.22]He's being a real prick.
[04:21.71]Yeah, there's a Heavy up there and a Medic.
[04:24.31]He's trying to take this stuff out.
[04:25.83]Oh, God.
[04:27.21]The Heavy's dead.
[04:28.93]No, he's still alive.
[04:31.01]Oh, they're trying so hard.
[04:32.35]I'm moving it.
[04:33.66]Well, I'm reflecting everything away.
[04:35.76]Hey, this thing was going to go down.
[04:36.72]You good?
[04:38.98]See?
[04:39.40]Look at that.
[04:39.76]Look at that.
[04:40.50]It's alright there.
[04:41.48]What's up, Pyro?
[04:42.04]Pyro, Spy, Spy, Spy.
[04:47.06]I think he cloaked.
[04:48.80]I'm reflecting every single thing.
[04:51.02]You're actually... I didn't realize you were doing that.
[04:52.66]Thank you.
[04:58.54]You were just sitting next to this man.
[05:02.77]Wow, that is, that is crazy.
[05:06.89]You're being babysat by a pyro.
[05:10.23]I'm gonna shoot down this hall.
[05:12.25]Alright, I think I can, like, leave now.
[05:17.05]Oh, no, I can't.
[05:21.47]No, they're gonna get my dispenser.
[05:23.99]Oh, Demoman's back for more.
[05:25.43]Here's the real test of might right here.
[05:28.25]Follow me up here.
[05:29.41]I'm gonna put the sentry up in front of that goddamn door.
[05:32.87]No, I'm gonna die!
[05:35.58]I just had two crit runs in a row.
[05:38.70]Go up those stairs.
[05:40.26]Go up around the left of this corner over here.
[05:41.80]I'm gonna try and put the sentry right in front of the door.
[05:44.54]Go up there and then protect me.
[05:48.21]Is that a spy?
[05:48.87]Alright, block it.
[05:52.25]Good.
[05:53.33]Now that they opened this door, they are in big trouble.
[05:59.56]I almost just made that Demoman kill himself.
[06:03.34]Gonna save my dispenser!
[06:05.00]Sniper in the tunnel.
[06:08.18]I just saw that.
[06:09.62]I was trying to, like, reflect it back at him the second it opened, and it would kill him.
[06:15.53]Which I almost did that.
[06:16.93]Oh, great.
[06:18.61]Nope, not happening.
[06:19.81]Not happening.
[06:20.83]You're not taking this out.
[06:22.51]Oh, Uber?
[06:23.87]Oh, he got it anyways.
[06:25.87]I tried.
[06:26.67]I tried to run.
[06:28.27]I'm going just stone-cold demo right now.
[06:32.29]Did you just kill him, or did he kill himself?
[06:33.81]He killed himself.
[06:34.93]Jeez.
[06:36.19]That scout scout has 5,000 kills.
[06:40.79]Jesus.
[06:42.45]Whoa, whoa.
[06:43.78]It's fun being in troll pyro.
[06:44.98]Uh-oh.
[06:50.96]Demoman in caves ahead.
[06:53.12]Oh, I need a medic.
[06:58.05]Need a medic!
[07:01.13]Oh my god, there's two Demoman up on the left, uh, the left walkway.
[07:04.15]If you have sentries, they're going down.
[07:06.33]Trying to shoot up there, trying to punch him through.
[07:13.96]Open up that door.
[07:15.70]Get slaughtered.
[07:17.02]Get slaughtered!
[07:20.17]Oh, three health.
[07:21.07]Okay, that's really cool.
[07:21.99]Let me run away.
[07:24.46]They got anything going on?
[07:25.24]Yeah, they got a dispenser.
[07:26.14]Get out of town.
[07:27.92]That's a spy pyro.
[07:29.16]Yeah.
[07:29.62]He's a Dead Ringer.
[07:31.42]Where'd he go?
[07:32.52]I have no idea.
[07:35.26]Oh, there's the teleporter.
[07:38.84]Gone.
[07:39.80]Did they get another one?
[07:41.78]I think there's another teleporter somewhere.
[07:44.18]I'm just... There's a sniper coming for me.
[07:47.24]Oh, that's so unlucky.
[07:48.64]Oh, it's a battle of wits.
[07:51.19]He got me.
[07:53.05]How does he have full health?
[07:55.65]How does he have full health?
[07:56.99]There's no health right there.
[08:00.17]I hit him twice with that frying pan.
[08:03.45]That's what we call grade A bull snip.
[08:06.66]Two Demoman on the car and a Mini-Sentry behind it.
[08:09.20]Uh-oh.
[08:10.42]This is bad.
[08:11.02]This is bad news.
[08:13.06]Okay, I'm going heavy.
[08:17.07]They might get this.
[08:17.81]Yeah, they're gonna get it.
[08:21.79]No, attack!
[08:22.55]I'm on the point!
[08:23.41]Get out of here!
[08:27.27]No, get him off!
[08:29.36]Dude, I have no... Oh!
[08:30.78]No!
[08:33.60]Oh, damn!
[08:34.82]Oh, I got a lot of points.
[08:36.06]I had a crits crew.
[08:37.04]I was gonna give it to you right away, but I just got murdered.
[08:41.14]Oh, well.
