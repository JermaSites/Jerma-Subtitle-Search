[05:22.59]What's the shot?
[05:26.07]You triggered all my explosives.
[05:29.08]You went soaring.
[05:32.57]Oh, man.
[05:36.76]Those explosives are just ridiculous.
[05:40.10]What a shot.
[05:40.48]I didn't know you had that.
[05:41.77]What a shot.
[05:42.07]I need to find those.
[05:43.29]What a shot.
[05:48.17]Just like good little boys and girls.
[05:50.39]Are these kids in traffic?
[05:52.09]Alright, you ready?
[05:54.13]What is that guy's problem?
[05:55.69]Alright, you ready?
[05:59.35]Just like good little students.

[06:07.34]Oh, the tandem.
[06:09.06]Here we go.
[06:10.16]All going for the same time.
[06:11.26]See you later, guys.
[06:17.85]It was so synchronized
[06:39.04]He didn't even get away.
[06:40.04]Like, he tried to bail and get away.
[06:42.29]I tried to get away.
[06:45.35]I was trying to just bail.
[06:46.95]Oh, that was so perfect.
[06:50.44]But not perfect at all.
[06:52.54]Oh, we don't flat ramp.
[06:54.38]Alright, let's do it.
[06:55.54]Watch out for the guy in the Ferrari.
[07:00.96]That seriously startled me.
[07:05.41]That scared me.
[07:06.75]What is blowing up?
[07:08.25]What just happened?
[07:09.50]What is going on?
[07:11.08]Whoa.
[07:11.40]Why are there so many explosions?
[07:13.84]Apparently I had my grenade launcher out instead of my pistol.
[07:18.94]What happened to me?
[07:21.03]Why did that happen to me?
[07:23.39]I don't know.
[07:24.65]I almost threw up in my mouth.
[07:26.97]I'm not kidding.
[07:28.24]That puke almost just came out of my mouth.
