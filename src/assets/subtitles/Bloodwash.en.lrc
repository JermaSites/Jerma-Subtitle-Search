[ve:61.7.100]

[00:21.71]I fixed it.
[00:22.25]I fixed it.
[00:22.61]Okay.
[00:22.93]Hi.
[00:23.75]Hey, how are you?
[00:25.11]Actually muted.
[00:25.79]Not anymore.
[00:27.95]How do I sound?
[00:31.25]What do you guys think?
[00:32.87]Do you like the new audio?
[00:33.97]Do you think it sounds alright?
[00:36.67]How does it sound?
[00:39.29]Welcome back.
[00:39.91]How are you?
[00:43.28]It sounds like shit.
[00:45.00]It does not sound like shit, okay?
[00:49.99]By the way, I only stream every three or four days, so I already know the joke.
[00:55.32]I already know the funny joke.
[00:57.20]But to put the mute thing up... You sound like you're in my head, please get out of here.
[01:10.94]You sound like old Jerma.
[01:16.49]It sounds too clean.
[01:18.89]It does sound worse.
[01:19.87]No, it doesn't.
[01:22.73]You know what the funniest part about this?
[01:24.31]In like three days, you guys will get used to this, and it'll just be normal.
[01:34.44]You sound like a 16-year-old.
[01:36.34]What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:37.84]Hold on, let me listen to it.
[01:38.66]Let me see how it sounds.
[01:41.46]You sound like 2010 Andy.
[02:13.14]This is what I hear, okay?
[02:16.75]I am a quarter of a second delayed in my head.
[02:22.61]So, I am listening to myself talking and I'm a quarter of a second delayed in my head.
[02:49.60]Okay, I have to mute that.
[02:51.22]I was hearing myself in my ears a quarter of a second after I talked.
[02:54.84]Okay.
[03:04.03]You sound like a librarian.
[03:06.49]I don't sound like a librarian.
[03:07.45]Look, it's going to take a little bit of tweaking.
[03:08.99]I just got it set up.
[03:10.83]It's going to take some tweaking.
[03:11.83]It's going to take some finagling.
[03:14.41]It's fine.
[03:17.98]You sound like a podcast host.
[03:23.45]Well, okay, what's worse?
[03:24.37]Podcast host or Jerma, please go back to the setup you had.
[03:28.37]You sound like you were in my bathroom.
[03:29.55]I don't think there's any compression even on.
[03:33.97]Alright, let's do a test.
[03:36.37]Ready?
[03:37.13]You guys can help me.
[03:38.78]Alright, this is going to be a quick test.
[03:40.28]We're going to see how you guys feel about this.
[03:45.46]How do you guys feel about this?
[03:48.67]I turned off some setting and now it sounds probably really awful.
[03:54.66]That sounds better.
[03:56.42]That's perfect.
[03:57.54]It sounds like an Xbox 360.
[03:59.10]Your voice is too crackly.
[04:02.74]It sounds exactly the same.
[04:04.48]Worse.
[04:08.14]It sounds the same.
[04:08.94]Okay.
[04:10.26]How about now?
[04:12.46]How does that sound?
[04:15.13]Do you guys like this better?
[04:15.97]Are you happier with this setup?
[04:18.37]Does this sound better?
[04:19.67]If I were to turn it up?
[04:24.45]It's very quiet.
[04:25.25]Well, okay.
[04:26.71]So how about this?
[04:28.43]You tell me.
[04:28.87]You tell me.
[04:29.83]We'll figure this out.
[04:30.51]We'll figure this out.
[04:31.13]How do you sound now?
[04:33.01]How you doing?
[04:37.23]Now you're too loud.
[04:40.34]You sound like a podcaster.
[04:42.64]That sounds really good.
[04:43.98]That was better before.
[04:48.07]I can't tell the difference.
[04:49.19]How do you sound?
[04:52.09]It's really too quiet?
[04:55.83]You sound like SpongeBob.
[04:58.15]What?
[05:03.05]It sounds like SpongeBob?
[05:07.53]Somebody said that's good, but you have the mute thing on.
[05:10.74]So you're full of shit.
[05:12.04]And look, there's no compressor on now, so if I get loud, it's gonna hurt your ears.
[05:15.90]Hold on.
[05:17.08]I have to... We're going back to this one.
[05:18.98]Oh my god.
[05:20.21]Okay.
[05:21.73]Alright, I don't fucking care.
[05:23.59]My audio setup has sucked assholes since I started fucking YouTube back in like 2010, okay?
[05:29.53]I really here for the audio?
[05:30.79]Are you here for the audio?
[05:31.87]Are you here for the audio?
[05:32.69]Is that what you're here for?
[05:37.93]Huh?
[05:40.33]You're here for the audio?
[05:41.51]I look like my fucking dad.
[05:43.21]Hold on.
[05:46.23]Are you even here for the audio?
[05:51.47]Okay, there we go.
[05:53.39]I think that sounds fine.
[05:54.29]Let me listen to it.
[05:54.81]Let me see how it sounds.
[05:56.95]Let me get a quick... I haven't changed my audio set in like fucking four and a half years.
[06:01.39]Okay.
[06:02.57]I think this sounds fine.
[06:03.67]This really does.
[06:05.35]Holy shit.
[06:06.53]Complainer Andes.
[06:08.53]This sounds fucking fine.
[06:09.89]This sounds flawless.
[06:11.53]If I get a little closer to the microphone... By the way, it's up here now.
[06:15.66]This sounds fucking flawless.
[06:17.84]This sounds, let me get loud.
[06:20.34]It's too loud.
[06:22.26]Oh, it's too loud.
[06:23.34]Oh, it's too soft.
[06:24.48]I need the bandage.
[06:27.26]Hold on.
[06:30.64]Bunch of fucking Goldilocks Andes.
[06:36.56]I have to stop monitoring because I can't even talk.
[06:42.43]How many times am I going to say Andy in the same day?
[06:44.37]Okay.
[06:45.63]I think it sounds great.
[06:46.99]I'm ready.
[06:48.35]That last bit sounded weird when you went high pitched.
[06:53.81]Microphones are fucking stupid.
[06:55.49]Microphones suck.
[06:56.41]And like, you're in a different place too.
[06:58.13]I moved my, look, this is here.
[06:59.75]It's in the way.
[07:00.67]Look at this.
[07:01.11]I don't even want to move it, but like, cause I got it in the right spot.
[07:03.45]This thing is aiming at me.
[07:05.73]I have this thing that's like aiming directly at me.
[07:08.65]It's literally aiming at me.
[07:12.05]Yeah, it's freaking me out.
[07:14.43]Actually, he's kind of freaking me out.
[07:15.67]This thing is literally aiming at me like a cannon.
[07:20.15]Dude, you got a duck.
[07:22.63]Alright, we're good.
[07:24.29]You sound like you have auto-tune on.
[07:25.81]No, I do not.
[07:26.71]I do not.
[07:27.11]I sat there for fucking an hour holding my hands like this and talking and going like, A, B, C, D, E. A, B, C, D, E. A, B, C, D, E. And I was like, that sounds fine.
[07:36.34]So we're going to keep it the way it is.
[07:43.12]Check the gain.
[07:49.20]I think it's fine.
[07:50.50]It's fine.
[07:53.38]Look, I have to turn my gain up because, look, listen.
[08:02.21]Why can I not talk?
[08:02.95]I just like froze up.
[08:06.01]Listen to me.
[08:07.10]Where?
[08:07.40]There you are.
[08:07.84]You're in a different spot now.
[08:09.04]Like the chat's like over here now.
[08:11.14]Like you're over there.
[08:12.52]I don't like this new thing.
[08:13.92]I'm going back to like it was in 2012 when I used to hold the mic like this because I didn't have a mic stand.
[08:23.21]The laugh had a distortion on it.
[08:25.07]Well, we'll figure it out some other day.
[08:28.83]My audio has been too low.
[08:31.03]People have complained about how I'm not loud enough.
[08:35.05]the laugh had a tinny sound hold on I know look trust me we'll get on with it just hold on let me see so when I laughed it was a tinny sound oh my god that is weird what the why is it doing that
[09:05.05]Why?
[09:05.49]You're the loudest person on Twitch?
[09:07.35]No, I'm not.
[09:08.43]Why is it doing that?
[09:10.99]Why is it doing that shit?
[09:15.23]Fuck.
[09:17.37]I'm sorry, guys.
[09:17.99]I didn't sit there.
[09:19.49]I didn't sit there and put my headphones in and sit there and go, like, what am I doing in here?
[09:27.80]You need to refund it.
[09:29.08]You're out constant.
[09:30.08]Am I too loud?
[09:31.22]But everybody says I'm too soft.
[09:34.78]The gain is too high.
[09:35.90]Alright, I'm going to turn the gain down and then we're going to get this right.
[09:43.22]We'll get it right.
[09:44.40]Okay, you ready?
[09:46.10]Boom.
[09:46.70]How's that?
[09:47.52]How are we feeling about this one?
[09:49.07]How do we feel about this?
[09:49.81]Do we feel pretty good about this?
[09:51.87]Are we feeling better about this?
[09:54.93]This is literally perfect right now.
[09:56.85]Okay, we have to do a test.
[10:01.43]Oh, I fucking hate that.
[10:02.65]Get off camera.
[10:07.57]The laugh is still weird?
[10:09.87]I think that was a weird laugh, man.
[10:11.39]Does that sound weird?
[10:18.21]You have a distortion filter on.
[10:19.42]I actually, I really don't.
[10:20.24]I promise, I really don't.
[10:22.54]It's phasing.
[10:23.52]Yeah, why is it phasing?
[10:25.86]Whatever.
[10:27.46]Look, the game we're playing is wicked fucked up today anyways.
[10:29.98]So look, just pretend it's part of the VHS filter.
[10:35.66]Yeah, who gives a shit?
[10:36.58]Let's go.
[10:38.96]I'll get it right.
[10:42.78]It's trying to cut off your weird voices.
[10:46.33]Why?
[10:46.83]That's weird.
[10:51.93]Alright, I just came in here to do some settings.
[10:54.15]Should I turn the filter off?
[10:55.79]Should I turn the VHS filter off?
[10:57.37]Or what?
[10:57.65]I mean, everyone hates this, don't they?
[11:07.82]Turn it off.
[11:08.20]And lights off, too.
[11:09.84]All the lights are off in my whole house.
[11:14.40]Just don't laugh or don't make any weird sounds.
[11:16.52]I'll figure out the weird sound filter that I have for no reason.
[11:21.13]Your... Your... Your mic thinks your noises are inhuman and is filtering them out.
[11:29.14]This is stupid.
[11:35.05]Whatever.
[11:35.53]I'm getting caught by a weird noise filter?
[11:37.75]I don't have a noise gate on.
[11:40.88]I don't have a compressor on right now either.
[11:43.84]I think this just hates me.
[11:47.02]Okay.
[11:48.96]The VHS filter kind of hurts my head.
[11:50.32]I'll keep the CRT filter on.
[11:52.98]If anyone has to complain about that, then get in line.
[11:55.67]I've got a lot of announcements to make today.
[11:58.95]Hold on.
[11:59.27]I'm not even fucking ready to stream yet.
[12:00.61]I've got a lot of things to talk about.
[12:04.72]Yeah, I'm not even ready yet.
[12:05.44]Hold on, give me a second.
[12:09.02]I have some announcements.
[12:13.26]Announcement number one.
[12:14.66]Are you ready?
[12:17.67]Over the next day or so, next couple of days... We are going to be officially... Officially... Did that sound weird?
[12:28.05]I just coughed, normally.
[12:33.71]Green Screen Part 3, the finale.
[12:39.31]The final Green Screen stream is coming in the next week or two.
[12:45.91]I'm going back in front of the screen one last time.
[12:50.58]One final time.
[12:53.26]Ever.
[12:55.54]So what's gonna happen is, just like in previous years in the Discord,
[13:00.61]You are going to go to the Discord.
[13:01.93]The channel has to be created.
[13:04.61]The rules need to be pinned up and everything.
[13:08.32]But I need actions.
[13:09.94]I need things that you want me to do.
[13:11.90]Just like in previous years, we're going to have people curate a ton of actions.
[13:16.42]I myself am going to go do some things as well.
[13:18.73]I'm going to make my own actions up.
[13:21.61]Please do all the Fortnite dances.
[13:23.61]Well, let me just be very clear.
[13:25.25]This is the last time this is ever happening.
[13:29.01]Three times in front of the green screen.
[13:31.00]There you go.
[13:31.62]That's it.
[13:33.74]We'll have the whole trilogy.
[13:35.98]And I'm going to do a green screen movie night.
[13:39.74]At some point in June.
[13:43.92]I will tell you the hard date that I'm going to go in front of the screen, but for now, let's just make this really, really... My microphone sucks, dude.
[13:52.30]We'll make this really easy.
[13:53.78]And just, if you have actions, I would like to see you do this.
[13:57.02]I would like to see you do this.
[13:57.98]We're going to have a discussion channel to open up and some ways you guys can figure out what you want me to do.
[14:04.80]I'll give you more info soon.
[14:06.60]What's the status on baseball?
[14:09.52]July 14th?
[14:11.44]The baseball stream is happening July 14th.
[14:13.30]That's all you need to know.
[14:15.20]I'm not telling you anything else.
[14:17.92]Please use multiple outfits.
[14:21.58]Do this IRL.
[14:22.61]I just did!
[14:25.57]Yeah, a lot of Discord users probably coming in right now.
[14:27.75]I don't think it's there yet.
[14:28.83]I just want to talk about it now.
[14:33.50]The second thing I want to talk about is auto.
[14:36.90]Otto was doing way better, if you missed the past weekend.
[14:40.40]Otto had a UTI.
[14:42.72]And it was actually really, really awful.
[14:44.58]Really sad.
[14:46.52]He was throwing up.
[14:48.63]He was peeing 10, 20 times in a couple of hours.
[14:53.63]He was constantly, every 5, 10 minutes, I gotta go out, I gotta go out, I gotta go out.
[14:56.41]It's like, alright, well, let's see what's going on.
[15:00.71]So, I kind of canceled the whole weekend worth of streams.
[15:03.57]And we're picking up... Did this horror stuff I was supposed to do two days ago?
[15:07.52]But he's been put on an antibiotic, and he is way better.
[15:12.24]I would say he's pretty much back to normal.
[15:13.64]He is almost 100% normal now.
[15:16.53]So that's really good too.
[15:18.33]Really happy about that.
[15:20.47]The other thing I want to talk about, let's talk about this.
[15:23.27]The archive channel, the VOD channel, you know, the Jerma archive channel on YouTube that you've come to know and love over the years, is now officially an official channel.
[15:38.36]That has been absorbed into the Jerma network.
[15:42.78]So that's really, really cool too.
[15:44.10]If you don't know what I'm talking about, the Archive channel has been uploading every stream I've ever done.
[15:53.40]And I mean, they're dating back to like 2014, 2015.
[15:56.12]Every single one.
[16:04.43]You need to upload the... Guys, I... I don't even have access.
[16:09.11]Okay, people are like, hey, dude, back in, like, 2013, you did, like, a stream.
[16:14.23]Do you have, like, access to that stream?
[16:16.15]Like, we kind of want to see it.
[16:17.11]It's like... Bro, I... I don't even know what computer I uploaded that on.
[16:23.79]You know, I have no fucking idea.
[16:28.17]I have no idea.
[16:29.91]Hey dude, you played Diablo back in 2012 on stream, on YouTube?
[16:34.63]Do you have any idea where I can find that?
[16:37.51]No.
[16:37.75]I don't know where that would be.
[16:40.81]I have no fucking idea.
[16:55.82]Only three Jerma channels.
[17:01.21]Hey, back in 2013, you did a stream.
[17:02.67]Do you have backup of that stream?
[17:03.65]Because a lot of us would like to see it.
[17:05.53]I have no fucking idea.
[17:06.38]Because I don't even know, I don't remember what I even had for breakfast yesterday.
[17:09.88]You think I remember what, like, hard drive from 10 years ago that I had some stream on it, maybe?
[17:14.88]I don't fucking know.
[17:17.92]Can we see the baseball stream in person?
[17:19.91]No.
[17:21.67]No.
[17:35.37]Saj.
[17:36.33]What about baseball merch?
[17:37.65]There will be baseball merch.
[17:39.47]A lot of it.
[17:41.41]And I'm really excited for it because it's gonna be... Oh, man.
[17:44.98]What do the kids say?
[17:46.88]It's gonna be... Give me some things that the kids say so I can sound fucking cool right now.
[17:51.72]I'm serious.
[17:52.10]They're gonna be some of the best merch you've ever seen in your whole life.
[17:55.92]It's gonna be awesome.
[17:57.74]Now, let's add a style right now.
[18:00.98]Bustin'.
[18:01.64]There you go.
[18:04.47]Oh, man, you're gonna be wanting to take, like, fucking pictures of this.
[18:06.79]This is gonna be so sick, trust me.
[18:11.44]Alright, I got another thing to talk about, because this is something that I wanted to address.
[18:15.38]You probably noticed a few days ago, or a week ago now, that I VIP'd some new people.
[18:21.26]And revoked VIP for all those people.
[18:24.68]Well, some of them.
[18:26.16]And there's a very important reason for that.
[18:28.24]As you know, over the last three years or so.
[18:30.37]Where's mine?
[18:33.25]Precisely what I'm about to talk about.
[18:36.51]So VIP has been in this weird place in the channel for the last three or four years or so, because I haven't really given it to really anybody.
[18:42.29]I mean, maybe a few times during random streams and whatever, but besides the community leader stuff in the Discord, I haven't really given it to anybody.
[18:51.40]And what I realized, and what I'm going to kind of change my rules here, I'm not giving VIP to anybody ever again.
[19:00.47]and there's very few specific reasons why, I cannot pick and choose people in this community.
[19:07.30]It seems like if I give VIP to somebody, there might be 10 other people that are disappointed.
[19:14.08]There might be 100 people that deserve it, but how can I possibly do that?
[19:20.29]Since this, I mean, there are 16,000 people here right now.
[19:23.77]Ever since this channel grew two or three times in the last two or three years, I cannot reliably pick out even probably a hundred of you that I would be like, okay, should I?
[19:33.60]You've done this, you've been around, you've said this, you've been like an active member of the... There's just too many people I could give it to.
[19:38.84]So...
[19:41.35]No one's gonna get it.
[19:43.05]I'm just... No one's gonna get VIP anymore.
[19:46.45]Unless... You are... Somebody that I really need to see.
[19:51.36]Like another streamer or... A game dev comes in or whatever, right?
[19:56.24]And I want to see them.
[19:57.72]Like in the chat.
[19:59.90]This is communism.
[20:05.07]What do you mean communism?
[20:06.37]I'm literally removing it from everybody.
[20:08.69]I'm not giving it to everybody.
[20:13.08]That's not... What are you talking about?
[20:17.29]Jerma, communist move.
[20:19.25]Mad, communist.
[20:22.79]Actually, that's not... That's not communism.
[20:27.97]I'm about to disturb... I'm about to disturb my microphone.
[20:30.40]Don't get me loud.
[20:31.26]I'm gonna do... Don't make me distort my microphone.
[20:37.13]No, but in all seriousness, no, it's too hard to pick, and I don't want- people will get pissed off at each other, and I already see the issues of, hey, this person got VIP, um, why didn't I get it?
[20:52.34]Or this person doesn't deserve it for XYZ, and it's like, I don't- I just don't even want to- I just don't even want to- I don't even want to do it.
[20:59.43]There's too many people to give it to.
[21:02.15]Too many people I could give it to.
[21:04.73]So, I'm just not going to give it to anybody.
[21:08.72]Understand?
[21:14.27]No cap, your mic is ass.
[21:18.41]VIP that person for an hour.
[21:24.10]The nuclear option.
[21:25.90]But sometimes you have to do the nuclear option.
[21:28.38]You really do.
[21:30.98]I don't want to have... I don't want to give VIP to five people and have five other people then like get mad at those five people and cause ripples through the community of people that are just pissed off that they don't have it or that they don't think somebody deserves it.
[21:46.29]For real.
[21:47.79]I don't want to cause this big pick... Jerma's picking favorites and he gave it to this person but not to this person.
[21:55.71]It's a huge problem.
[21:56.57]It really could be.
[21:57.47]So I don't even want to have it be a problem.
[22:00.99]And this is a horror game night, so you should be fucking scared.
[22:08.70]We have a webcam mic on.
[22:10.14]I don't, there's no webcam mic on right now.
[22:14.28]You know how angry, you know how angry that just made me, what you just said?
[22:21.88]You guys are gonna get used to it.
[22:24.35]New things are evil and awful, right?
[22:27.68]Remember when I had the new audio setup and everyone told me that I'm the worst streamer on the website?
[22:33.69]I remember looking over at chat and people on my other audio setup that you've gotten used to over the last two or three years, right?
[22:40.21]Somebody wrote like this paragraph.
[22:42.85]I might be making this up.
[22:43.75]I don't know.
[22:44.17]I could be.
[22:44.57]But like, I swear to God, I looked over and someone was like, dude, like you're like probably the worst fucking Twitch streamer, like quality wise and professional wise or something.
[22:51.58]And I'm just like, what the hell?
[22:59.40]Let's go.
[23:00.14]Why is this here?
[23:00.76]I don't know.
[23:02.09]This is a mystery that we need to solve.
[23:06.77]Can you guys help me with this mystery?
[23:08.15]Why is there a chili cheese Frito here on my desk?
[23:14.71]What?
[23:15.11]Why is this here?
[23:16.03]I'm not going to eat it.
[23:18.52]What if it hit the ground?
[23:19.58]Why is it in here?
[23:23.24]The mic censored.
[23:24.30]Fuck.
[23:24.66]Or did you not say it?
[23:25.92]I don't know.
[23:29.85]He saves all his production value for the big streams.
[23:32.41]Thank you.
[23:33.87]Thank you.
[23:34.91]I appreciate that.
[23:35.65]Alright, this is Bloodwash.
[23:38.59]It's a scary game about... I don't know.
[23:41.71]People told me to play this.
[23:42.61]People said, hey dude, play this game.
[23:43.85]And it's scary.
[23:44.45]And I've been sitting here for 30 minutes.
[23:45.87]So, what production value...
[24:11.57]That's all I have to say about that.
[24:12.45]How do you not know what I'm doing?
[24:22.61]There's people talking!
[24:39.52]Are you fucking kidding me?
[24:40.48]What are you... Those!
[24:41.10]No, I'm doing the thing.
[24:41.80]I'm doing the thing.
[24:42.44]That fucking meme.
[25:06.79]I actually just did it.
[25:10.81]Whatever.
[25:11.33]I don't care.
[25:11.79]Let's go.
[25:12.15]Let me pay attention to this because this is important.
[25:15.37]I need to pay attention.
[25:16.15]This is a scary game and you're fucking with me.
[25:19.11]Should I turn the volume down on this?
[25:20.89]Should I turn it up or loud?
[25:21.69]This is one of those games that's going to blow my eardrums out, right?
[25:36.01]I'm scared.
[25:37.85]I'm not scared of the jumpscares, I'm scared of my ears hurting.
[25:43.60]Okay.
[25:46.54]Haven't had time to unpack yet.
[25:47.84]Not sure when I will.
[25:50.49]He did that on purpose.
[26:02.93]Not really, actually.
[26:05.77]I mean, I got like halfway through it, and then I realized that I was doing it, so I was like, fucking whatever.
[26:10.17]And then I started laughing about it.
[26:12.21]Hold on, I need to see it.
[26:16.07]Well, people were like, what do you mean, what am I talking about?
[26:18.27]It's so clear what I was pointing at.
[26:20.85]Soy Andy.
[26:21.51]Let me see if I did it on purpose.
[26:23.07]What are you... Those...
[26:31.78]Yeah, okay.
[26:33.24]Okay, at about, so of this clip right here.
[26:36.98]At exactly eight seconds when my mouth opens and I say those is when I was realized that this is what I was doing.
[26:45.42]So I just held it.
[26:46.06]I freeze.
[26:47.27]I froze.
[26:47.99]And that's when it was, you know, it could have been, um, could have been on purpose at that point.
[26:53.45]It was not on purpose until about seven and a half seconds in that clip.
[26:59.03]Can I play the game before people scream at me for being the worst streamer on Twitch again?
[27:02.08]Okay, I'm done.
[27:10.61]Why do you hate Europeans?
[27:11.71]I live in the fucking America!
[27:20.42]I live in the United States of America on the westernmost coast of the country.
[27:24.70]You and I, when you're eating breakfast, dude, I'm just going to bed.
[27:28.42]I'm like getting under the covers and like going to sleep when you wake up and you eat breakfast.
[27:32.74]When you go to bed, I'm like, oh, waking up, it's like fucking 11 o'clock in the morning.
[27:38.47]I live across the world from you.
[27:41.77]I live in the United States of America.
[27:45.87]He hates Europeans.
[27:49.65]Alright, I need to leave.
[27:55.27]It's 3 a.m.
[27:55.94]right now.
[27:56.76]Dude, it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon here, and I'm at peak happiness.
[28:00.92]So, I'm sorry.
[28:04.78]Okay.
[28:06.04]Let's go.
[28:08.64]I can't leave.
[28:09.08]I need to gather my dirty clothes.
[28:10.31]Alright, let's get the dirty clothes.
[28:16.53]Pizza?
[28:18.83]Chia?
[28:18.97]Chia?
[28:22.36]Small black and white TV, okay?
[28:25.47]Okay.
[28:26.37]Alright, how much dirty clothes do I have?
[28:30.33]Dirty clothes and... Coke 24-packs.
[28:35.11]Did I get it all?
[28:35.61]Okay, I think I got it all.
[28:39.33]Is there a sprint?
[28:39.79]There is.
[28:41.47]What do you mean, all my dirty clothes?
[28:45.18]No.
[28:45.92]Is that it?
[28:47.00]There we go.
[28:47.70]I think that's all the dirty laundry.
[28:48.78]Time to go to the basement.
[28:52.65]You didn't deny that you hate EU.
[28:54.33]What do you mean I hate EU?
[28:58.69]No, I'm saying I don't hate EU.
[29:03.86]I just said it.
[29:05.18]I said I don't hate EU.
[29:06.80]Why are you making that up?
[29:07.56]What, are you trying to make me look bad?
[29:11.78]I'm sorry that our clocks are different.
[29:14.19]Right now.
[29:15.83]Where's the basement?
[29:18.65]Oh, okay.
[29:27.26]Wait, what?
[29:28.76]Jerma, keep me entertained while my bowels are being cleansed.
[29:31.92]That's from the Dusk dev.
[29:41.08]I'm gonna try.
[29:41.96]A nice man lives here.
[29:44.26]It's good to know you have at least one good neighbor.
[29:46.16]Alright.
[29:52.31]Newspaper. Headline reads: womb ripper strikes again. In the early hours of the 30th authorities were called when a passerby found a terribly mangled corpse haphazardly tossed on the nearby grounds.
[30:05.31]Sources indicate that the woman was indeed pregnant, and just like previous victims the fetus was cut out and assumed to be taken by the assailant.
[30:13.31]This is now the fourth victim in as many weeks and authorities are struggling to come up with leads in one of the most gruesome crime sprees the city has ever endured.
[30:23.77]What the fuck?
[30:25.79]A woman and her son live here.
[30:26.81]Now that I think about it, I haven't seen either one in about a week.
[30:32.89]Holy shit.
[30:37.76]Okay.
[30:40.44]Oh, also, you know what's different about this audio setup that a bunch of people are going to be really pissed off about?
[30:45.24]But I'll try to fix it eventually.
[30:47.43]I make a ton of mouth sounds.
[30:48.99]And now... Now you can hear them all.
[30:54.97]See, before you couldn't hear any of those.
[31:02.82]See?
[31:03.58]I hate that.
[31:05.61]Okay.
[31:07.23]I don't need to go to that floor, besides one of the people on that floor has a mean dog.
[31:13.56]Alright, we'll make sure we get over this really quick.
[31:16.32]Let's get over this really quick, because I know that we're going to see a lot of these, so let's just get over this for the next minute or so.
[31:21.80]Let's just get over this.
[31:23.64]Hold on, let me just get over this real quick.
[31:30.52]Let me just get over this.
[31:36.32]Okay.
[31:37.72]This is... We're going to get over this.
[31:39.48]Just bear with me while we go through these.
[31:42.44]Okay.
[31:45.30]Very nice.
[31:47.31]Yes.
[31:47.99]Absolutely.
[31:51.03]Okay.
[31:51.27]I think that's BB-8, or whatever that character's name is.
[31:56.83]Okay.
[31:58.35]Yep.
[31:59.33]Let's keep them coming.
[31:59.95]We're going to blow through these.
[32:01.31]Uh-huh.
[32:07.63]Very nice.
[32:08.01]It's a pretty good website if you're looking for news or... How did you... Okay.
[32:22.00]That one's kind of big.
[32:22.68]Uh-huh.
[32:31.30]This one's... But why are these so... Like, who cares?
[32:34.10]This is like...
[32:40.76]Yeah, I'm sorry, but Las Vegas is fucking cool, okay?
[32:43.66]I'm sorry.
[32:44.58]Me pointing at the Las Vegas sign is not me pointing at the Reddit sign, because Vegas is fucking cool.
[32:50.00]I love this place.
[32:51.26]So, um... Excuse me?
[32:57.39]Somebody made the template.
[33:04.03]But it's not even... Here's the template.
[33:06.47]Should I leave this on the stream?
[33:23.25]So stupid.
[33:31.55]Oh, this is so annoying.
[33:35.70]Wait, I've already done this?
[33:36.90]What do you mean?
[33:37.38]Hold on.
[33:40.96]A classic.
[33:41.70]I did already do this?
[33:46.28]This is from years ago.
[33:52.25]This is the hot air balloon.
[33:55.31]I didn't actually do this, did I?
[33:56.75]I fucking did.
[34:00.53]This is before anybody even gave a shit about this.
[34:05.31]This actually was from like four years ago.
[34:07.80]Before that meme, anyone even cared.
[34:09.00]Oh my god, I look like shit.
[34:14.18]I look tired.
[34:14.90]What's wrong with my eyes?
[34:16.76]Why do I look so fucking disheveled?
[34:18.72]Okay.
[34:21.51]Okay.
[34:23.40]Uh, this one, we'll just put this one up, and then I'm gonna move on.
[34:25.42]I'm gonna play the horror game that I'm supposed to be playing.
[34:28.38]But, you know, why not show this one too?
[34:29.96]This is gonna be a favorite, I think.
[34:35.45]You look... like a newly discovered fish.
[34:40.91]Alright, dude.
[34:49.33]Okay.
[34:50.89]That was fun.
[34:52.67]Let's, uh, let's play the video game.
[34:55.71]Do I have audio?
[34:56.17]Alright.
[35:00.22]You look like a taxidermy fish.
[35:06.26]What do you look like at 8 o'clock in the morning?
[35:08.26]Oh, that's loud.
[35:12.32]That's very loud and it hurts.
[35:13.52]I gotta... Alright, this is the last one I'm gonna show, I promise.
[35:43.78]Nice zit.
[35:54.05]An old tire.
[35:55.15]Actually, I don't like the CRT filter.
[35:56.95]It kind of makes me want to throw up.
[36:04.72]Out of order?
[36:08.00]Turn it off.
[36:08.42]Yeah, it kind of makes me want to puke.
[36:13.86]Fuck.
[36:24.04]It's worse.
[36:28.62]Smells like it hasn't been taken out in months.
[36:33.78]Out of order?
[36:34.72]What am I gonna do now?
[36:35.76]I should probably go back upstairs and figure something out.
[36:38.10]Turn the head bump off.
[36:41.52]I think I heard something coming from the closet.
[36:53.13]I think I need to keep it on.
[36:54.49]I think it's designed to have it on.
[36:55.65]Because it looks weird now.
[36:58.97]Yeah, it looks... It somehow looks worse the other way.
[37:01.57]What do I mean from the closet?
[37:12.94]Oh, that hurts.
[37:13.54]I don't need to go through there.
[37:27.52]Loud, by the way.
[37:28.30]It's probably going to be loud.
[37:29.14]Somebody's probably going to jump in front of the screen.
[37:33.58]Go back.
[37:34.88]You ignored this jump scare.
[37:36.91]What?
[37:37.11]What are you talking about?
[38:01.32]Let's see what's inside.
[38:02.12]This one's empty.
[38:07.44]Filled with porno.
[38:08.46]What are you talking about?
[38:14.50]The closet?
[38:17.43]What closet?
[38:19.77]This is a filing cabinet.
[38:46.17]That's a tuba reaction.
[38:47.09]I kind of feel like a cartoon.
[38:49.77]It was a tuba reaction.
[38:50.73]I didn't not... Whatever.
[39:01.36]Goddamn girl, you scared the bejesus out of me.
[39:04.46]Goddamn girl, you scared the bejesus out of me.
[39:07.05]I scared you?
[39:08.51]You scared me.
[39:10.33]What the hell are you doing creeping around down here?
[39:12.83]Goku.
[39:15.79]I love this acting.
[39:16.90]I love this actor.
[39:17.92]This is great.
[39:18.62]This is actually, I love this.
[39:20.18]Yeah.
[39:42.48]This is never gonna end, is it?
[39:44.68]This is never gonna end.
[39:45.48]This is what happens.
[39:46.86]I just can't stop.
[39:47.82]I cannot stop this.
[39:55.93]But I need to show them, right?
[39:58.01]It's my obligation to.
[40:04.69]I believe you.
[40:05.61]Just next time, maybe don't go around slinging doors open and hiding in the dark.
[40:15.92]Okay.
[40:22.07]Thanks a lot.
[40:25.33]I thought you guys were full of shit that I missed the jump scare.
[40:27.97]I thought, like, the, go check the closet.
[40:30.20]I thought it was this.
[40:32.38]I did not know the door was gonna rip open.
[40:39.00]That was very scary.
[40:39.94]It was probably loud.
[40:41.78]Just, it's going to be loud.
[40:42.76]Just please be aware of that.
[40:44.98]You're going to hear... Oh, fuck.
[40:51.17]I don't have a noise gate anymore.
[40:52.19]You definitely heard that, without a doubt.
[40:56.93]Oh, well.
[41:00.15]Fuck.
[41:01.41]This is why I can't... Wait.
[41:03.07]Forget what I just did.
[41:06.90]What's up, sir?
[41:08.66]Oh, you know, trying to balance life, school, and job hunting.
[41:11.88]It's a tough world these days.
[41:14.08]Liam been treating you well?
[41:15.70]When he isn't drunk, yeah.
[41:18.32]Look, you'll tell me if it gets bad, yeah?
[41:22.42]Is this my neighbor?
[41:23.92]I know it ain't easy to talk about, and you don't have to tell me nothing.
[41:28.21]Just promise me you'll tell me if you need help.
[41:31.01]My sister used to be in a bad situation too, and there's places you can go.
[41:34.89]I appreciate that, Stan.
[41:36.65]I really do.
[41:37.67]Yeah, sure.
[41:38.93]You doing some laundry at this time of night?
[41:41.15]I'm trying to.
[41:42.05]Of course, when I really need it, the washer downstairs is broken.
[41:46.34]Ain't that some shit?
[41:47.98]Yeah.
[41:49.08]And speaking of shit, I have an interview tomorrow, so I guess I'll show up smelling like crap.
[41:54.42]Jesus.
[41:54.74]Well, if it's an emergency, I heard of this laundromat that's open 24-7, just outside of town.
[42:00.50]Still early enough to catch the last bus.
[42:03.23]24-7 outside of town.
[42:04.97]I'll have to say, though, it's a hell of a time to be out so late, especially with that maniac roaming around.
[42:11.24]I mean, if I needed to do laundry and I couldn't, I'd probably just turn the sink on and just put a bunch of soap in the sink and plug the hole so the sink would fill up and just like and then just kind of hang it over the shower curtain and just let it dry.
[42:35.34]I'm a big girl, Stan.
[42:37.21]Do you know the address?
[42:39.57]Sure, sure.
[42:40.67]Let me write it down for you.
[42:42.55]1800s Laundry?
[42:43.03]I mean, if you just need one, you know, a shirt, a pair of pants, maybe another shirt or something.
[42:52.16]Yeah, I would just turn the shower on.
[42:53.56]I would just put the clothes on and just get in the shower and take a shower with the clothes on.
[42:58.58]And then just take them off and just air dry them.
[43:11.32]Why is that weird?
[43:13.94]Is that really that weird?
[43:15.22]To like wash your clothes in an emergency situation where your laundry machine doesn't work or to just wash your fucking clothes in the sink?
[43:26.62]Why is that such a weird take?
[43:31.56]It's warm water and soap.
[43:33.23]What do you think happens in the washing machine?
[43:34.77]Do you think there's like a magical elf when you turn the washing machine on that takes your clothes to some place to clean them?
[43:43.13]It's just soap and water and it just goes... It doesn't do anything else.
[43:53.92]While wearing them.
[43:56.36]Well, I don't know.
[43:56.76]You could probably save water.
[43:58.02]You could take a shower and clean the clothes at the same time.
[44:09.98]Okay.
[44:11.12]So now I just gotta get ready to go to the laundromat, I think, right?
[44:14.36]I thought that was a clock.
[44:19.94]I thought that was a health pack.
[44:29.64]Alright.
[44:30.08]I'm ready to go.
[44:30.54]I got my clothes.
[44:32.49]I'm ready to move out.
[44:38.55]Let's go!
[44:39.03]Do I have to go all the way down, or just out this front door?
[44:55.70]I'm on the second floor right now, okay.
[44:57.10]Second floor.
[44:59.46]I need to get my purse first.
[45:01.50]What?
[45:10.26]Stan's the murderer.
[45:13.20]Don't you dare.
[45:13.94]Okay, if that's a spoiler, you're in deep shit.
[45:19.02]You're in deep shit.
[45:23.65]That person's in deep shit.
[45:25.99]Alright, where's my purse?
[45:33.81]Where's my purse?
[45:35.43]Oh, there it is.
[45:36.81]You can backseat me.
[45:38.19]You can call me an idiot.
[45:39.27]You can call me stupid.
[45:40.43]But the second that you put what happens at the end of Endgame in the chat here, I don't think so.
[45:49.28]Alright, let's do it.
[45:57.47]Goodbye.
[45:57.71]This image is just on my other monitor.
[46:01.71]I'm going to add this as JermaChest to BTTV.
[46:05.59]Whatever, that's fine.
[46:07.98]That's fine.
[46:13.78]That's fine.
[46:18.88]Ugh.
[46:20.68]Alright.
[46:21.06]Can I turn the audio down?
[46:23.24]Is it really going to be that loud?
[46:24.28]I don't like that.
[46:26.10]I don't like this.
[46:27.46]I don't like how loud the sounds are.
[46:29.04]There's a person right here.
[46:33.90]Hi there.
[46:35.38]Are you okay?
[46:36.46]Can I get you anything?
[46:38.25]It's gone.
[46:40.03]They took it.
[46:41.81]Did someone steal something from you?
[46:43.53]They took it.
[46:45.77]The people in the walls.
[46:47.17]They took it from me.
[46:49.45]Oh God!
[46:50.17]She's here now!
[46:52.23]I should probably leave him alone.
[46:54.05]Poor guy.
[46:54.61]Jesus.
[47:08.08]Bus stop.
[47:08.34]What?
[47:30.94]What are you doing?
[47:32.42]Run?
[47:37.72]Is that the bus?
[47:39.04]That's not the bus?
[47:39.86]That would be a really weird bus.
[47:57.11]What the fuck?
[48:00.75]Got any change?
[48:02.27]Sure, I have a couple dollars.
[48:04.87]Better than nothing.
[48:05.97]Thanks, kid.
[48:07.11]Haven't seen you around here before.
[48:08.85]I moved in not too long ago.
[48:11.37]I'm usually studying or at my classes, so that's probably why.
[48:14.67]What's that?
[48:16.99]Oh, a college girl, huh?
[48:19.25]What are you studying?
[48:21.75]I'm pursuing a career in education at the moment.
[48:24.72]Nice.
[48:25.36]That's what I got my bachelor's in.
[48:28.08]Oh, that's great.
[48:30.20]I hope I can find a gig soon afterwards.
[48:34.07]If not, my sleeping bag has room for two.
[48:36.63]Anything in the dumpster?
[48:43.86]Oh, there's the bus!
[48:49.62]How do I get on?
[48:54.92]Where are you heading at this hour?
[48:57.49]If you don't mind me asking.
[48:59.77]The laundromat on the outside of town.
[49:06.35]Not sure I believe that.
[49:08.23]Pretty late to be doing laundry.
[49:09.99]Hey, if you're looking to score, I have a good deal just for a pretty little thing like you.
[49:16.00]You won't even have to pay cash if you know what I mean.
[49:19.62]How about you just drive the bus and I'll pretend you're not a desperate loser?
[49:23.14]Whatever, bitch.
[49:25.08]Sit the fuck down so I can get this piece of junk rolling again.
[49:28.83]What the fuck?
[49:32.86]Dirty seat, dirty seat, dirty seat, dirty seat, dirty seat.
[49:44.88]Um... Well, I guess I'm gonna sit here.
[49:47.94]Ah, it's gonna be fucking loud.
[49:49.26]Should I turn it down?
[49:59.73]Turn it down.
[50:20.09]Turn it up.
[50:20.53]I was gonna say, excuse me, when does the bus leave?
[50:30.54]There was a... I looked online and said the schedule was at 12.15 and it's 12.18.
[50:33.14]Turn the FOV down.
[50:51.39]What are you doing?
[50:52.11]Sit down in a seat.
[50:56.27]Why are you still... Okay, that's fucking... Sit down in a seat!
[51:10.20]Alright, dude.
[51:10.86]Like, seriously, sit down.
[51:12.07]No fucking way.
[51:14.11]This is no way.
[51:15.19]This guy right now would be going like this.
[51:18.57]Flanning his right foot and stuffing it on the ground and desperately trying to not fall down.
[51:27.14]You don't have to do that, by the way.
[51:28.62]I know that when some of you guys get on the train or on the bus or whatever, you just grab onto it.
[51:40.94]Dude, I fucking hate this guy.
[51:42.80]He's just weird and he's right next to me.
[51:50.98]How many of you guys have done that shuffle?
[51:53.40]Where you just plant your foot and you don't want to grab onto anything because it's like, well, no, I can't grab onto the pole.
[52:00.17]I can handle it.
[52:01.85]Then you go... And then everybody looks at you and they're like, fucking idiot, should have just held on to the pole.
[52:14.96]Alright, I don't want...
[52:20.58]This person's freaking me out.
[52:28.12]I did that as a kid?
[52:31.50]Look out the window.
[52:34.21]It's so dark I can't even see the street.
[52:38.19]I knew he was gonna do that.
[52:40.27]I was ready for it.
[52:41.27]I was like, oh dude, look out the window.
[52:42.81]Okay.
[52:44.41]Hmm.
[52:47.59]I fucking knew that was gonna happen.
[52:49.07]I knew it.
[52:49.61]I was waiting for it for the whole time he was on the bus.
[52:52.23]May I sit beside you?
[52:56.17]There's plenty of other seats, so I don't see why you would need to do that.
[53:02.72]May I... May I sit beside you?
[53:08.26]Are you deaf?
[53:10.88]Do I need to get the driver to throw you off?
[53:13.66]You're going to die tonight.
[53:19.67]What?
[53:20.91]You're going to die tonight.
[53:23.73]I've seen it.
[53:25.23]Tonight is your last night on Earth.
[53:28.51]You are walking straight into your doom.
[53:31.79]Can't you see that?
[53:33.81]You and that child inside you.
[53:38.47]How did you... You will be found, just like all the others.
[53:45.58]I-I mean...
[54:10.27]That's where you put the fucking, just fucking grab him by the neck.
[54:13.00]Just grab him.
[54:13.72]Just fucking go bang into the back of the, over here.
[54:16.08]And be like, what are you, what are you threatening me with?
[54:17.92]Tell me what's happening here.
[54:25.90]Get his ass.
[54:38.13]Yeah, you mean, if someone, like, I don't know, man, I'm just like... You kind of be like, oh, what's, uh... Let's go!
[54:45.39]You know what I mean?
[54:46.07]Like, go!
[54:50.59]Like, what's that?
[54:51.25]The lights are... Something... God, crap!
[55:04.00]No noise gate so loud.
[55:05.64]I told you!
[55:19.05]It's not that bad?
[55:26.04]That guy was fucking scary.
[55:39.62]I'm scared, please turn it off.
[55:42.54]This is what we're here for.
[55:47.21]Good job.
[55:47.53]You completed the tutorial in one hour.
[55:49.83]No.
[55:50.89]Don't be a liar.
[55:53.27]Don't be a liar.
[55:54.69]That's what you're doing.
[55:55.27]You're lying.
[55:56.67]The first 30 minutes of the stream was me talking about announcements, talking about some changes that I'm going to be making.
[56:02.22]We sat there for about 30 minutes.
[56:03.78]Then I did the soy face thing.
[56:05.84]That was about 15 minutes.
[56:07.36]So no, that's you being a liar.
[56:09.12]And I don't appreciate that very much.
[56:11.84]It's been about 15 to 16 minutes of actual in-game video game time.
[56:33.65]What?
[56:39.81]Laundromat.
[56:43.39]Okay.
[56:50.16]Yes, what is it?
[56:51.88]Oh, um... Are you all really open all night?
[56:56.26]We're open all night, but I take my naps at midnight, so you better not need anything after that.
[57:01.84]Oh, okay.
[57:03.54]I'll be sure not to need anything.
[57:05.12]Yeah, we'll see.
[57:06.82]You get a game toy here?
[57:11.49]Press tab to equip and un-equip your inventory.
[57:15.27]I'll bring it back before I leave.
[57:16.41]It'll be a long night, so I might need it.
[57:20.10]Game toy?
[57:20.62]Can I play it?
[57:21.92]Whoa, okay.
[57:22.76]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.

[57:37.16]How do I- what do I do?
[57:37.80]How do I control the game?
[57:42.64]What the fuck?
[57:43.26]Did I just kill somebody?
[57:44.00]Am I doing this right?
[57:56.21]Am I doing this right?
[57:58.79]Should I not be doing that?
[58:06.38]Should I not be doing that?
[58:07.30]Alright, what if I avoid?
[58:08.12]Well, I can't.
[58:08.88]I have to.
[58:10.11]Score one!
[58:18.87]Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.

[58:26.56]Alright, I gotta pay attention to the screen!
[58:40.06]How many, what do I need to win?
[58:51.02]The song is really good.
[58:52.54]Yeah, it's a pretty good song.
[58:57.16]Oh, I'm done.
[58:58.48]That was stupid.
[58:59.06]Like, I... Alright, what do I, do I actually have to, do I have to do this?
[59:04.07]You have to get to a hundred.
[59:15.25]Okay, get that out of here.
[59:16.91]Alright, so I'm just gonna do my laundry.
[59:18.89]Which one should I use?
[59:20.22]Those are dryers.

[59:39.11]Yeah, I work night shift at the factory down the road.
[59:43.97]This place is the only one open when I get off work.
[59:47.19]Was a real pain when the first one burnt down.
[59:50.56]First one?
[59:52.36]You knew around here?
[59:53.96]Yeah, this place used to be next door years ago.
[59:57.58]But there was a big fire.
[60:00.02]I don't think they ever found out exactly what caused it.
[60:03.12]That sounds awful.
[60:05.90]Girl died in that fire too.
[60:08.73]It was me that died in the fire.
[60:10.99]This is like a whole weird Silent Hill type thing where it's me that died in the fire.
[60:36.39]right they were close to opening up a murder investigation right that a detective thought the girl was locked in could be but then decided to drop it when nobody came up you know cops lazy sons of bitches
[60:52.89]As a fellow writer, you know, as a fellow writer, when you start to see the pieces come together in the intro, or what could be the outro, I can kind of see it from a pretty long way away.
[61:05.84]As a fellow writer, of course.
[61:07.02]Well, if that's true, it does sound pretty suspect.
[61:14.53]sure does feels like it got swept under the rug pretty quick what with the womb ripper coming around and butchering those women that has all the headlines these days okay so alright so let me just do my laundry pick up urban legends one
[62:07.48]Okay.
[62:10.93]Alright, that was pretty good.
[62:12.35]What happened though?
[62:15.05]I couldn't really tell.
[62:15.63]Oh yeah, okay.
[62:23.12]So how do I do laundry?
[62:25.94]Dryers?
[62:33.54]Washers.
[62:34.14]Okay, where do I... How do I use one?
[62:36.83]Washers, washers, washers.
[62:42.21]Oh, okay, this one's open.
[62:43.85]Need to get some change first.
[62:54.62]Where's the change?
[62:55.12]Change machine?
[62:55.44]Change machine?
[63:01.56]What do I make change?
[63:03.44]What do I make change?
[63:04.20]What do I make change?
[63:12.35]The vending machine?
[63:13.25]Isn't that usually a thing to do it with?
[63:18.65]Or is it?
[63:22.66]Magazines.
[63:23.34]Where's the change machine?
[63:27.96]You put the dollar in, you get the arcade tokens.
[63:32.91]You need to look in your purse.
[63:36.09]Explore, you stooge.
[63:40.29]I'm still fucking so pissed off that they're not in Fortnite.
[63:44.55]Yeah, look at who the other day added to Fortnite in the last two weeks.
[63:48.64]And you tell me that the three stooges could not have been a possibility.
[63:52.34]Please.
[63:54.82]In fact, it's going to fucking happen.
[63:56.76]It will happen.
[63:57.52]It's just not going to happen on our timetable.
[64:05.25]Aren't they adding, aren't they adding, like, Obi-Wan Kenobi?
[64:17.12]Three Stooges is two, bro.
[64:18.20]Eh, Pac-Man?
[64:19.82]Pac-Man, how is Pac-Man not Boomer?
[64:24.07]Alright, where do I make change?
[64:27.61]That's fucking weird.
[64:30.47]Oh my god, why is it all the way over here?
[64:31.79]What a terribly designed place.
[64:38.23]Pac-Man's coming next week.
[64:39.21]They're going to add all the Wizard of Oz characters.
[64:46.62]Dorothy, Tin Man, the Tiger, the Scarecrow.
[64:52.68]They're going to add... There's going to be a Wizard of Oz update.
[64:55.38]They're going to add... Okay.
[65:01.45]I feel so pissed off by this.
[65:03.58]I'm going to have FOMO on this.
[65:05.78]Because if I don't make a bet here, and they add the Wizard of Oz characters in a year, I'm going to be pissed because I could have told you I was right.
[65:17.06]You know what I mean?
[65:17.86]I didn't say that.
[65:19.20]I may have started to say it, but I didn't say it.
[65:25.16]Take a look at the other stores in the plaza.
[65:30.10]How much are you going to put up?
[65:31.78]There's no way they're going to add the Wizard of Oz.
[65:35.27]What about like Willy Wonka?
[65:37.41]Right?
[65:40.57]Also, I don't know why I'm attributing... Fuck.
[65:43.85]This is what's happening.
[65:45.97]I am attributing all the slot machines in the casino with what is popular with the Fortnite kids.
[65:51.27]Which is completely inaccurate.
[65:53.67]Willy Wonka slot machines are literally fucking everywhere.
[65:57.19]Wizard of Oz slot machines.
[65:59.04]Everywhere.
[66:01.27]The Three Stooges have a bunch of slot machines.
[66:07.13]I'm doing this wrong.
[66:12.40]I still think... Sounds like a child crying, but I don't think it's a kid.
[66:31.80]shoes that's because boomers play slot machines and zoomers bet on Fortnite skins just wait I am are you ready listen to me you can in a hundred years you can go back and watch this clip they are going to have to pivot soon in these Vegas casinos
[66:54.43]Because all the Wizard of Oz slot machines are not going to do very well when Zoomers are like, no, no, no, no.
[67:00.66]I want, where's my Fortnite machine?
[67:03.66]There's going to be Fortnite machines.
[67:05.98]There's going to be video game, like Zoomer type machines.
[67:10.62]There's not, I don't think, I think slot machines might be replaced with like skins.
[67:16.29]You sit down and you like pull the machine and it's like a skin, like a box opening.
[67:22.25]I think, I don't know in like the next 50 years or so if people are going to care that much about spinning a slot just in making, oh, like I hit money.
[67:30.96]I don't think so.
[67:32.00]I don't think the younger generation cares that much.
[67:35.08]I think like Fortnite skins might be more or some type of video game thing.
[67:41.77]A Morbius slot machine.
[67:43.65]I'd play it.
[67:45.25]I've never even seen the movie.
[67:46.41]I would just sit there and like laugh.
[67:52.23]Morbius slots ah customer looking for a TV toaster blender sorry I'm just browsing Oh what kind of person just browses appliance stores at this time of night
[68:16.18]I don't know if I, I mean, anytime I go to like a Best Buy, I always just end up walking around the washer and dryers and stoves and just go, oh, that's nice.
[68:27.64]I'm never going to buy one of those.
[68:28.82]But you kind of just walk around, just open up the lid, turn the dial.
[68:34.90]That's it.
[68:35.18]I'm just waiting on my laundry.
[68:36.86]Well, then why don't you just buy a washer and dry here?
[68:40.48]We have the newest models at the lowest prices.
[68:44.02]That's such a stoner thing to do.
[68:48.37]I've never heard of a stoner that's like, yo, bro, let's go look at the washing machines at Best Buy, dude.
[68:58.50]No, it's like, I've been abducted by aliens, and I think aliens exist.
[69:05.23]And I think the aliens are putting the TV shows on, the TV stations.

[77:43.97]My friend was, like, making a joke about, like, let's, like, go into the porn section.
[77:48.65]And, like, it was funny.
[77:49.54]It was, like, you have one of these?
[77:51.50]That's crazy.
[77:52.72]I was just saying, I, like, couldn't believe you actually had one of these.
[77:55.28]It's, like, crazy.
[77:56.02]Like, what the fuck?
[77:56.82]I was going into it.
[77:57.28]Like, that's funny.
[77:57.80]Should I buy a gumball?
[78:20.95]Ooh, games.
[78:22.89]The Master System is out now.
[78:24.73]This is still my favorite.
[78:27.22]Okay, I don't think... My laundry has probably been done for an hour.
[78:30.91]What am I doing still here?
[78:39.76]Oh, the story of Pee Pants, right.
[78:40.88]Okay.
[78:42.38]So, Burgah Boy and I used to play Smite all the time.
[78:46.22]And we would just, you know, you'd make the... I think it was like a party or something.
[78:51.29]You had to, like, join with a password or something.
[78:53.11]Whatever it was.
[78:55.21]So, we would be playing games and we'd be making the...
[78:59.85]yeah smite okay whatever fine you can do you batch test me all you want so we were in the essentially I was being told hey here's the password to get into the lobby so then we can queue up together or whatever it was so he gives me the password he's like hey this is it the password is pee pants and I was like okay fine so I'm like pee pants um it doesn't work so the password is incorrect I said hey do the password is incorrect this doesn't there's no it's not pee pants
[79:27.60]And Burgah Boy looks at me and he just goes, yeah, it is.
[79:30.80]By the way, Burgah Boy was high.
[79:32.24]He was like as high as a kite.
[79:33.98]And he's sitting there going, it's pee pants, dude.
[79:35.98]It's like, Burgah Boy, it's not.
[79:38.52]Is there a space?
[79:39.96]Is it like pee space pants?
[79:42.35]No, it's just no spaces, no capitals, pee pants.
[79:46.06]I'm just like, I keep typing that.
[79:47.94]It's not it.
[79:49.10]And me and him get into an argument about how he thinks I'm, like, fucking with him.
[79:54.46]Because I'm... It's pee pants and you're not doing it and this is annoying and we want to... I want to play.
[80:01.21]So eventually, finally, after, like, probably at least three to five straight minutes of being annoyed with each other, I go, how are you spelling this?
[80:09.91]And I walk over and I show him what I'm typing.
[80:12.29]And he's like, what?
[80:13.49]This not... He's like, this...
[80:18.64]Pee pants.
[80:19.78]That's how he thought it was spelled.
[80:23.53]He thought it was P-A-N-C-E in his like high weed brain.
[80:29.21]So we were actually in a pretty, it was, I was not, we were both pretty annoyed.
[80:34.12]And he was spelling it P-A-N-C-E.
[80:36.16]And that's what he, that's what he thought pants was spelled in that moment.
[80:40.72]And then finally, he sat there and was just like laughing his ass off.
[80:46.26]And then pee pants just became a verb that we just started using.
[80:52.72]We would call each other that if we had like a stupid moment.
[80:56.38]It'd be like, oh, hey, pee pants.
[80:58.67]Come on, pee pants.
[80:59.85]Like we just started calling each other that.
[81:01.05]We started using it as a verb and stuff.
[81:04.86]Oh, dude, you're a wicked pee-pants right now.
[81:07.84]Oh, yeah, okay, yeah.
[81:09.76]It was fun.
[81:10.54]Using it as a noun, verb.
[81:12.02]We pretty much used it as... We used to use random words, kind of like Smurfs.
[81:17.81]We'd replace them as nouns and verbs, and it was just a Smurf language.
[81:22.25]It was weird.
[81:23.31]We used to do it all the time with tons of stuff.
[81:32.39]is Burgah Boy.
[81:33.35]Oh, that's a... New viewers.
[81:51.76]Okay, so I think I'm ready.
[81:52.54]Okay, I thought someone was coming to get me.
[82:04.30]Why is he called Burgah Boy though?
[82:05.68]I don't know.
[82:06.00]Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he used to bring double cheeseburgers into the movie theater.
[82:09.92]Like they were popcorn.
[82:12.54]Like a bag of at least four to six of them and eat them for the movie.
[82:16.74]That might've had something to do with it.
[82:18.12]Did I get the laundry?
[82:28.69]You haven't said that?
[82:35.45]How do I use the dryers?
[82:36.47]Oh, these are washers.
[82:54.95]Bathroom key?
[82:59.55]That's old lore?
[83:00.49]Oh, yeah.
[83:01.67]I know I've told that story before.
[83:07.16]Okay, so go to the bathroom?
[83:15.59]You've told the pee pants stream a bunch of times, too.
[83:17.84]Oh, yeah.
[83:18.12]Do you guys still talk?
[83:21.60]Yeah, from time to time.
[83:22.46]I think he's doing alright.
[83:30.66]Just living on the west coast, a lot of people that I would talk to on a regular basis.
[83:35.52]Obviously, I live in Vegas, right?
[83:37.73]But yeah, I think he's doing pretty good.
[83:40.73]Last time I talked to him.
[83:44.33]Don't I have the key?
[83:54.69]God damn it.
[84:09.20]I don't want to read that.
[84:15.12]This might be fun to call if I get bored.
[84:16.56]There's a phone in the lobby.
[84:19.19]Really?
[84:21.45]Really?
[84:21.75]Wait, why did I go in here?
[84:40.60]Is there something I need?
[84:41.71]Police report.
[84:43.39]Police report that details a suspect named Lewis Kennedy.
[84:47.09]This is just for public intoxication, but that name keeps popping up.
[84:50.65]Wonder if I can find out more about him.
[84:52.63]Bring this to the people and see if they have anything to say about it.
[84:56.09]Do something funny.
[84:57.29]Your dog is crying?
[84:58.30]Why does your dog care if I make a joke or not?
[85:03.82]Oh my god, there's somebody in here.
[85:06.04]Oh my god.
[85:08.96]Is there an item I need over here or anything?
[85:13.84]Dude, okay.
[85:14.48]This is probably something I need right here.
[85:19.70]Nothing?
[85:21.64]Okay, goodbye.
[85:31.53]What is... Who's that?! !
[85:39.79]What happened?
[85:40.53]I feel like I was supposed to be scared.
[85:42.30]I was like, why is there a naked guy?
[85:45.16]What happened?
[85:45.68]I just turned the corner and I thought there was a naked person.
[85:52.48]So I just went like this and then I was supposed to get jump scared, I think.
[85:56.91]Who put this here?
[85:57.69]I don't know.
[86:05.75]Did you do that?
[86:07.35]Doing a late night wash too.
[86:09.11]Yeah, I work night shift at the factory down the road.
[86:13.97]This place is the only one open.
[86:15.85]Yeah, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know.
[86:25.42]Okay, don't click again.
[86:27.08]Do you know anything about this?
[86:30.17]No, not these comic books.
[86:31.77]This.
[86:32.62]Do you know anything about this?
[86:33.98]Shows him a porno mag.
[87:09.00]So I just gotta show this to people in the town?
[87:15.24]That sounds like you.
[87:16.34]Call that number.
[87:19.72]Don't tell me what to do.
[87:21.02]Okay.
[87:23.76]Where's the phone?
[87:28.62]Oh, what?
[87:29.29]The phone is ringing!
[87:32.99]In just a few moments, you will be connected to the girl of your wildest fantasies for 63 seconds.
[87:40.07]Well, hey there, stud.
[87:42.41]Alright, for one second, one second, I thought she said 63 seconds with an English accent.
[87:50.06]Not 63 seconds, 63.
[87:54.78]You'll be connected for 63 seconds.
[87:56.48]I was like, what?
[87:57.64]Oh, okay, that's a weird number.
[87:58.84]And then I read it.
[88:02.38]The phone rang.
[88:34.71]Didn't the phone ring?
[88:35.55]I didn't call.
[88:37.57]I answered the phone.
[88:38.81]Oh, I bet.
[88:40.03]Well, what kind of person just dials a random phone number at this time of night?
[88:44.37]A burnt out college student who's waiting.
[88:46.25]I didn't make any phone calls.
[88:47.87]Go home and get some sleep.
[88:50.22]Those places are still open at this time of night?
[88:53.90]Just this one, a little out of town.
[88:56.60]Wait, in that plaza with the pizza palace?
[89:00.92]Yeah, that one.
[89:02.60]You know it?
[89:04.68]Yeah, I live out there.
[89:06.17]Hey, you really shouldn't be out over there this late at night.
[89:09.03]Not with the womb ripper at large.
[89:10.85]I remember... Do you guys remember the commercials late at night on TV for these lines that were 1-900 numbers?
[89:18.35]It's like, call now and talk to the hottest of all of us, right?
[89:23.79]Do you remember those?
[89:24.33]And it was always like two or three dollars a minute.
[89:28.57]I remember just sitting there going...
[89:31.36]How... I wonder... Do they like try to keep people on the phone?
[89:37.98]And the more that I thought about it is like... I'm trying to think of ways to keep somebody on the phone for $2 a minute.
[89:44.99]And one of the things I was thinking of was... Oh yeah, it would be so sexy if we played a full game of Monopoly over the phone.
[89:53.09]I would think that was so hot.
[89:55.96]Yeah, you do?! !
[90:00.16]That'd be like, oh, you know, if we could play Risk, that would be fantastic.
[90:06.18]Just gave them there.
[90:09.82]They were always so weird, though.
[90:10.90]I remember just being, because I was an infomercial aficionado, right?
[90:14.38]We all know that.
[90:15.88]But in between those or on random channels at the past 12, 1 a.m., you'd get those ads all the time.
[90:31.94]you called them do you guys really think so I'm gonna call and have sent to my parents house huh I wasn't even old enough to make these phone calls I don't think why would I what are you talking about I am in no way going to have my mother or father back then
[91:01.81]You're like, why is there... Why is there all this shit here?
[91:05.83]Why would there... I never thought they were worth it.
[91:07.81]I was like, I'm not going to call these.
[91:08.83]I was like, I don't know.
[91:12.74]I don't want to do that.
[91:13.88]That's weird.
[91:15.48]He's offended.
[91:16.72]What an obvious lie.
[91:22.16]The 30 second call the 1-900 number that we're just talking, taking the piss on right now.
[91:28.26]You think I was calling it every day?
[91:32.57]You're weirdly defensive about this.
[91:34.81]I have not called one of these numbers.
[91:37.80]I was with one eye open like this.
[91:41.64]With that on TV, I don't fucking care.
[91:45.00]Where's Cathy Mitchell?
[91:50.82]Why do I do this to myself?
[91:52.38]Why do I do this?
[91:53.30]Why are you doing this to me?
[91:54.82]Listen to me.
[91:55.92]I mean infomercials, infomercials, infomercials, infomercials.
[92:00.48]I wanted to watch infomercials, not call fucking.
[92:03.38]Okay.
[92:04.50]Alright.
[92:04.84]That's enough.
[92:06.22]Why are you doing this to me?
[92:07.74]That's enough.
[92:08.68]That's enough.
[92:11.15]I have to get out of here.
[92:26.27]Look at how red I am.
[92:27.49]I'm like embarrassed.
[92:28.59]Like I don't want anybody to think this.
[92:32.32]It's a real psychopath, and you are right in the middle of its hunting ground.
[92:35.24]Do you understand?
[92:39.26]You need to take your laundry right now and get out of there as fast as you can.
[92:43.22]That's like embarrassing.
[92:45.65]What is going on in this dialog?
[92:51.53]Your free 60 seconds has ended.
[92:53.83]To have another late night sexy conversation, please enter your credit card number now.
[93:01.22]It's the same reason why hotels, when they had all the porn in the hotel rooms.
[93:06.76]I didn't want to check out of a hotel and walk up to the person at the checkout counter and... Sir, would you like a receipt?
[93:18.08]No.
[93:18.92]No.

[93:28.07]Can you drag the receipt into the recycling bin right now?
[93:31.21]I'll give you $200 right now.
[93:34.09]Sir, it says you only have about $42 in charges.
[93:36.66]No, just don't open it.
[93:37.44]And here's $200 cash.
[93:38.38]Don't look at the receipt.
[93:39.02]Don't look at it.
[93:41.64]I don't know.
[93:42.22]I don't want to talk to somebody and be like, oh, hey, by the way, what do we have for these charges?
[93:48.12]Some incidental charges to the room.
[93:53.55]No.
[94:03.54]So you bought it.
[94:04.08]No, I didn't.
[94:04.88]I'm just saying.
[94:06.10]I didn't want to have anybody... You're making it worse.
[94:09.22]This is a self-report.
[94:10.20]No, it's not.
[94:10.94]I'm watching porn in a hotel room.
[94:19.90]No, I, like, I just want to sleep in the hotel room.
[94:22.56]You know what I mean?
[94:23.02]I don't want to do, no.
[94:25.98]I don't want to sit there and, and just sit there like, what, like, alright, let's, here we go.
[94:35.47]No.
[94:36.53]Jerma, stop.
[94:37.37]You need to act cool.
[94:38.95]Act cool.
[94:39.31]You gotta act cool.
[94:41.11]Alright, alright, I'm gonna, I'll act cool.

[94:50.70]It's not a big deal.
[94:51.48]Whatever.
[94:51.86]Be cool.
[94:57.25]This is actually so bad.
[94:59.05]No, it's not.
[94:59.85]I'm telling you that we made a couple of comments about late night telephone sex lines.
[95:05.91]And all of a sudden, I buy porn every time I go to the hotel.
[95:10.19]That's you doing that.
[95:11.66]That's you putting that on me.
[95:14.04]We never talked about that.
[95:15.74]We literally never talked about that.
[95:18.42]I made a quick comment about this, and it became literally what I do every day.
[95:24.41]Lewis Kennedy?
[95:25.87]Nope, never heard of him.
[95:27.23]Do you ever watch his porn and gets naked?
[95:32.93]Yeah, I mean, no, no, I get naked.
[95:35.01]You have to go take a shower and get naked.
[95:37.71]I'm done with this conversation.
[95:38.61]Put it in emote-only mode right now.
[95:40.25]Put it in emote-only mode.
[95:41.43]I demand emote-only mode right now.
[95:44.19]Emotes only.
[95:46.36]For an hour.
[95:55.32]Alright, you've never heard of Lewis Kennedy.
[95:58.28]That's fine.
[95:59.49]Anybody else here?
[96:00.05]Can I play this?
[96:13.89]You look just like her.
[96:15.89]Who?
[96:17.75]Same eyes.
[96:18.79]I'm telling you, it's me.
[96:19.95]Same hair.
[96:20.93]It's me.
[96:22.21]Oh, she used to be so beautiful.
[96:26.18]But I've lost her.
[96:31.26]It's been so long now.
[96:35.02]Oh, did you know one of the girls who went missing around here?
[96:42.60]Ma'am?
[96:48.64]Oh, and by the way, let me just make this really clear.
[96:53.76]It's 2022.
[96:56.44]If you've consumed pornographic material, this isn't like 1902, where it's like, oh, no, nobody's consumed, how dare you, the devil.
[97:07.21]Who really gives a shit?
[97:08.77]Who really gives a shit?
[97:10.25]If you watch porn movies in the hotel room, I don't...
[97:15.97]I don't care.
[97:16.55]Who cares?
[97:24.87]I don't give a shit if you're watching porn in your hotel room.
[97:27.53]What the fuck do I care?
[97:28.57]It has nothing to do with me.
[97:36.09]I'm glad that got sniped and I'm glad it did.
[97:45.45]My fingers are so... Okay.
[98:09.47]I'm going to take it off of emote-only mode in ten seconds.
[98:20.99]I want strict behavior.
[98:27.76]Okay.
[98:28.42]Okay.
[98:31.92]We want behavior.
[98:32.96]I want you on your best behavior.
[98:37.44]There could be a sponsor watching.
[98:39.02]You never know.
[98:40.10]There could be a sponsor watching.
[98:42.40]How would you... There could be somebody from... I don't know.
[98:46.81]You never know.
[98:47.29]I gotta be careful.
[98:49.11]Don't talk about that anymore.
[98:51.81]Alright, so is my clothes done?
[98:56.37]I just keep getting derailed.
[98:59.73]I think this game is like a 40-minute experience, and I just keep getting so derailed.
[99:08.43]What about maybe Peepaw?
[99:10.57]Yeah, I'll go talk to Peepaw.
[99:26.66]Old Lewis was a real son of a bitch.
[99:29.96]Had a real eye for the younger girls he did.
[99:33.40]Don't mean to gossip, but I have it on good authority he was the one who knocked up that poor girl who worked for him.
[99:41.83]Can't remember her name, but between that scandal, the fire, and then the disappearances, I would say all the details will never be known.
[99:51.93]Okay.
[100:08.45]I don't know why, I just thought it would be, like, kind of funny.
[100:11.37]Remember Supermarket Sweep?
[100:14.59]Imagine they did, like, a Supermarket Sweep type thing with, like, a video store.
[100:19.07]And it was the person, the contestant got to the end.
[100:21.45]And it was like, okay, you gotta go through each aisle and you gotta get as many DVDs as you want!
[100:27.24]Any shelf, anything that you care about, right?
[100:29.44]And the music starts and it's like, alright, let's go!
[100:33.70]they fucking sprint into this room and just start sliding their hand into the cart just filling it with all these porns and they don't even touch anything else and after five straight minutes they come out of here with like a cart full of just porn dvds and everyone just sitting there like what the fuck don't go in there I'm whatever he looks like a shrimp me like wait the animal the shrimp
[101:03.59]What does the shrimp's face look like?
[101:04.79]There's blood on this?
[101:15.30]Gross.
[101:16.00]Okay.
[101:32.14]Can I just read you a portion of my modding chat?
[101:37.62]This is from VRJosh.
[101:38.94]This is very important.
[101:41.85]Thumbs up.
[101:42.69]Emote only mode enabled.
[101:44.03]I'm not going to read that one.
[101:46.25]Next one.
[101:47.51]I'm ready, LOL.
[101:48.77]Okay.
[101:49.47]Emote only coming off.
[101:50.46]I'm going to block the word porn.
[101:53.06]Never mind.
[101:58.23]They're trying.
[101:59.86]They're trying, guys.
[102:01.68]They're trying.
[102:02.18]Did I already show this?
[102:05.48]Did I already show you this?
[102:06.16]Okay.
[102:08.34]I think that's pretty much it.
[102:10.80]There's nobody else to talk to, right?
[102:25.58]Is there another store over here?
[102:26.38]Wasn't this the car that was in front of the bus stop?
[102:32.26]Yeah.
[102:35.90]That's the bus stop car.
[102:41.08]Do I look like a shrimp?
[102:44.36]Let me see.
[102:47.66]What does a shrimp look like?
[102:49.26]I know what they look like, but... Do I look a little bit?
[102:52.74]What animal do I look like?
[102:54.92]Alright, mods, run a poll.
[102:56.96]I want you to run a poll and I want you to put 10 of sort of the most iconic animals.
[103:03.14]I don't want people to vote on what animal they think I look like.
[103:18.19]I need to code for that lockbox.
[103:21.17]Ugh.
[103:28.30]Can I break this?
[103:35.00]What do I do with this doll head?
[103:39.41]Polls only have five options.
[103:42.21]Oh, never mind.
[103:52.86]So what do I do?
[103:54.40]My clothes are not done drying yet.
[103:58.70]Or maybe they are.
[104:02.90]No, they're not done.
[104:05.82]Oh, there it is.
[104:06.74]What the hell?
[104:07.90]These clothes are still wet.
[104:09.69]This machine must be broken, but those were my last quarters.
[104:12.97]Where's that employee?
[104:16.97]Um, excuse me.
[104:20.99]Excuse me.
[104:27.09]Where are you?
[104:29.89]Hello?
[104:30.31]Get out.
[104:35.21]There's blood.
[104:44.53]What are you doing in here?
[104:45.73]What do you have to say about this?
[104:47.93]Not my kind of doll, if you know what I mean.
[105:01.06]Do you read these?
[105:01.60]I don't need to ask him about this, okay?
[105:05.02]So what's going on?
[105:05.80]Oh my god.
[105:18.43]It's the employee.
[105:20.19]He's been ripped to shreds.
[105:21.77]I need to call the police.
[105:27.84]Beep, beep, beep.
[105:38.45]Shit.
[105:47.63]You watched porn at the Holiday Inn and got caught.
[105:51.70]That's very specific.
[105:52.76]Why are you still on that?
[106:00.19]Somebody just fell from the ceiling.
[106:03.49]Somebody fell from the ceiling covered in blood and they were, like, ripped up.
[106:07.13]And you're still on the dude you got, like, caught at the Holiday Inn, like, back, like, a year or two ago or something.
[106:13.87]We're trying to play a game.
[106:15.13]20 minutes later.
[106:22.50]20 minutes later.
[106:29.74]Dispatch said they got a call coming from out here.
[106:33.50]But it's strange.
[106:37.27]Don't give them specific time frames.
[106:39.77]I'm just... I'm getting in their mindset.
[106:44.35]I can't seem to be able to find anyone.
[106:47.13]Where is this person talking?
[106:50.72]There's no body in here?
[106:51.66]What?
[106:51.76]What?
[106:57.79]What do you mean?
[106:59.77]I'd be a rodent.
[107:02.63]I don't know if I'd be a rodent.
[107:03.55]I think I'm more of a lion.
[107:09.09]Well, you're a police officer.
[107:15.03]Go look.
[107:31.90]I hate this.
[107:32.62]I hate this.
[107:33.70]Go look in there!
[107:35.12]Go look in there.
[107:36.10]I... All I have is I have a key for a weapon.
[107:42.38]I'm the police officer?
[107:43.39]What are you... Oh, I'm the officer.
[107:49.75]Oh.
[107:56.47]The office by the pizza place?
[108:07.43]Oh, it's just somebody that has to do their taxes.
[108:12.33]Yeah, I get upset every fucking April 10th as well.
[108:15.89]Hello?
[108:27.00]Is anyone there?
[108:29.21]That was a boomer joke, that's fine.
[108:31.10]Oh, god!
[108:31.32]Business plan.
[108:31.70]Computer, doesn't look suspicious.
[109:03.86]Binders... Copy machine... Water... Water... Cooler?
[109:16.85]The TV got worse.
[109:17.85]It's hard to see.
[109:26.33]Oh, fuck off.
[109:30.71]I found if you sniff in when you think a jump scare is going to happen, it scares you less.
[110:07.42]How many bolts do I have an infinite amount good
[110:37.74]Office key.
[110:39.55]I'm so bad I want to press G and throw a grenade down the hall.
[111:08.28]Get the key!
[111:08.88]Get the key!
[111:09.38]Get the key out, man!
[111:11.82]Where's my key?
[111:12.42]I got an office key.
[111:14.80]Office... Oh, I thought it said office Burton.
[111:17.80]Burton's office.
[111:18.80]Walked.
[111:19.24]I can find a key.
[111:19.92]What is this?
[111:21.84]Is that where... I can't... How do I get it?
[111:34.17]The door is stuck.
[111:38.97]Why do I get my key out?
[111:40.03]Turn on a flashlight?
[111:41.09]What do you mean turn a... I don't... I need... Where's my key?
[111:47.92]I just picked one up.
[111:50.28]Door's stuck.
[111:50.96]Door's stuck.
[111:51.64]Door's stuck.
[111:53.94]But I got a key to the office, didn't I?
[111:57.62]Locked!
[112:01.15]It's tab, isn't it?
[112:02.41]There's no scroll.
[112:13.79]Where do I get it?
[112:14.59]Press I?
[112:15.13]I picked it up, didn't I?
[112:23.79]I don't get it.
[112:24.43]Yeah, I have it.
[112:25.01]How come I can't use it?
[112:28.55]Look at the fire extinguisher.
[112:37.19]Where?
[112:37.39]I don't get it.
[112:37.93]Press 1, 2, 3, 4.
[112:40.62]Press the key button.
[112:41.62]Usually I just hit tab and I have an inventory.
[112:47.10]I don't understand.
[112:47.68]What's happening here?
[112:49.82]It's one?
[112:50.54]It's not one.
[112:58.83]It even says I need a key.
[113:01.15]Is it bugged?
[113:02.27]Right click?
[113:06.09]Locked.
[113:06.65]What the fuck?
[113:07.55]Scroll with the gun out?
[113:09.37]Oh, come on, Gwynn.
[113:37.29]What?
[113:51.66]Oh my god, you gotta help me.
[113:55.60]Slow down.
[113:56.20]It's okay.
[113:56.82]Just follow me and I'll get you out of here.
[114:07.61]Fire!
[114:08.53]Fire!
[114:10.23]Fire!
[114:11.97]Fire!
[114:14.74]What happened?
[114:15.60]Huh?
[114:17.66]What?
[114:18.10]Okay, go.
[114:19.38]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[114:35.44]Honestly, at this point, I don't give a shit.
[114:37.44]I'm gonna turn the corner and... Yeah!
[114:40.02]Yeah!
[114:42.94]I don't care.
[114:43.54]I'm gonna turn the corner and someone's gonna go, Wait!
[114:45.68]And I'm gonna... You know what I mean?
[114:48.34]In those old, like, shooter games.
[114:58.48]Yeah!
[115:23.76]What are you talking about?
[115:25.16]I didn't get him.
[115:26.58]I was shooting every two steps.
[115:28.88]And the one step that I don't shoot, I get killed.
[115:33.71]No one's coming?
[115:35.27]Maybe I can make a run for it.
[115:53.31]I'm fucking smashing in the head.
[116:24.82]Receipt.
[116:26.24]It's a receipt for a building repair company.
[116:28.94]Looks like they had to repair one of the walls in the... Oh.
[116:33.56]Okay.
[116:36.00]I can smash the wall with a hammer.
[116:38.84]Without a doubt.
[116:43.53]God damn it.
[116:44.07]Am I closed on...
[116:54.63]What the fuck are you doing?
[116:56.53]Rock.
[117:01.95]When the pound breaks, the cradle will fall.
[117:11.32]What?
[117:11.64]Baby.
[117:14.78]Cradle and all.
[117:19.66]Baby is drowsing.
[117:23.85]Who is doing that?
[117:24.81]Are they in the washing machine?
[117:29.78]Discord mic?
[117:35.14]I don't know, we're just gonna get out of here quick!
[117:37.89]There's a door behind here.
[117:40.65]Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[117:58.17]Grenade.
[117:58.65]Nope.
[118:04.94]Do I hide?
[118:10.13]Do I... Where do I go?
[118:10.83]Do I hide in here?
[118:11.95]In a vent?
[118:12.29]Just leave?
[118:33.70]Fuck you.
[118:39.79]Newspaper.
[118:42.59]Main suspect in police investigation disappears.
[118:47.26]45-year-old Lewis Kennedy has gone missing.
[118:49.68]The top suspect in the grisly crime of an arson and alleged kidnapping.
[118:54.30]What the fuck?
[118:56.28]Sources say that Kennedy had been under surveillance for a few weeks and at some point over the course of the last night had broken contact with officers.
[119:02.60]That was a centipede scream?
[119:09.13]The audio did something really weird to your voice.
[119:11.11]Can I hear it?
[119:11.53]Let me hear it.
[119:14.41]Take less cocaine next time.
[119:17.62]Let me hear this.
[119:21.71]Let me see.
[119:22.01]I need to know what this sounds like.
[119:27.93]How bad does it sound?
[119:36.34]That's so weird.
[119:43.22]What the fuck?
[119:43.85]It sounds like I'm in a different room.
[119:46.74]So it doesn't sound like that right now.
[119:48.12]It's only when I get loud.
[119:49.66]It sounds like I have like, it sounds like I'm like yelling into my hands.
[119:57.87]It doesn't sound like that right now, right?
[120:03.11]That sounds like a Diablo II death sound.
[120:06.33]It really does.
[120:28.69]it does it sounds like a Diablo II death but what's missing is me slamming the desk and going what the dude it's trying to filter out anything that it's a noise that humans don't normally make
[120:50.94]I don't know.
[120:51.52]I tried to fix it, but I don't know what the fuck is going on there, man.
[120:59.87]That's so fucking dumb.
[121:02.15]Sounds like an old Mortal Kombat attack.
[121:08.20]It does.
[121:09.76]It really does.
[121:15.06]Mortal Kombat on the SEGA Genesis.
[121:18.56]Okay, um...
[121:28.40]Okay, I'm gonna fucking freak out.
[121:36.65]AC unit?
[121:38.65]It won't open.
[121:39.93]Flashlight.
[121:41.99]How do I turn it on?
[121:48.39]F for flashlight?
[121:56.69]What the fuck?
[122:00.78]I don't want to look this way.
[122:01.74]I want to run away.
[122:02.46]It won't budge.
[122:05.47]What do you mean it won't budge?
[122:06.91]Hide somewhere.
[122:07.79]Hide in the filing cabinet or something.
[122:09.23]Hide in the filing cabinet.
[122:11.09]Hide over here.
[122:12.41]Go this way.
[122:12.99]Turn on the flashlight.
[122:16.29]Yikes.
[122:18.45]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[122:26.04]Whoa!
[122:32.45]A scalpel.
[122:42.55]I thought that was my face.
[122:43.87]I thought that was an emote of my face.
[122:47.53]I know I won't be getting out of here alive.
[122:52.57]That psychopath.
[122:54.29]It kills women like me.
[122:55.63]I've heard at least three of those brought here and killed.
[122:59.33]Peeking through the cracks, I saw that it creates these masks out of skin.
[123:04.01]Whoa!
[123:05.67]I don't know what kind of game it's wanting to play.
[123:07.25]I think my time is up.
[123:08.93]It made me swallow a key.
[123:10.19]A key that I think would get me out of here, but I have a feeling it won't let me live long enough to use it.
[123:14.69]I'll at least try to butcher it like the rest.
[123:27.32]Ah!
[123:30.97]Where are you?
[123:31.90]I know that this is this person over here.
[123:33.28]Is this gonna burn me?
[123:36.94]You?
[123:37.38]I got a scalpel and I got a... There's a key?
[123:42.54]I can't believe I'm doing this.
[123:43.46]I got a key to get out of here.
[123:45.99]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[123:47.33]Give me that key.
[123:48.11]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[123:50.13]Just... I'm gonna hold this out and run.
[123:52.05]Oh, he's gonna be in this door.
[123:57.59]He's gonna break through this door.
[123:58.50]I know it.
[123:58.78]He's gonna break through the door.
[123:59.50]He's gonna... He's gonna break out the door.
[124:04.84]Wrong key.
[124:23.02]Is that?
[124:23.28]Who's that?
[124:30.48]Corpse.
[124:31.98]Who is it?
[124:33.32]No, I don't want to... Get out of here!
[124:34.44]How do I get out of here?
[125:11.22]Oh.
[125:14.72]Oh.
[125:14.86]Person, Scoob.
[125:20.42]Rocky, we need to run out of here.
[125:21.76]Like, I agree, Scoob.
[125:22.69]Let's skedaddle.
[125:24.47]Rocky, we need to run out of here.
[125:45.22]Find the child.
[125:54.99]Oh, by the way, speaking of those two... I have access to the Multiversus Early Alpha.
[126:02.50]I was thinking about playing it on stream at some point.
[126:06.56]Just letting you know.
[126:07.60]I have access to it.
[126:10.96]And that could be pretty fun if we were to do it eventually.
[126:16.45]Can I go through here?
[126:19.91]I need to get this lock off.
[126:29.14]What was that?
[126:29.88]I don't know.
[126:30.98]I don't know.
[126:31.42]I don't know.
[126:32.16]I don't know what it is.
[126:35.90]I don't know.
[126:40.22]I don't know.
[127:12.97]Pick up ammo.
[127:16.56]I have ammo?
[127:17.16]Okay, I've got ammo.
[127:19.12]I don't know.
[127:30.69]You're gonna be right here, aren't you?
[127:57.39]Gun.
[128:04.94]How many bullets does this have?
[128:07.18]I'm afraid to shoot it.
[128:09.66]How do I turn the flashlight on?
[128:13.67]It's so hard to see.
[128:22.66]Oh, there's so many washing... Gosh, there's so many washing machines down here, Mickey.
[128:28.48]Oh, of course there is, Goofy.
[128:30.64]That's where they do their laundry.
[128:46.15]That's a bad bit.
[128:46.93]I'm not doing a bit.
[128:56.06]Come out, you asshole.
[128:57.76]I'm ready for you.
[129:02.98]Why would you do that?
[129:04.92]Don't say that.
[129:06.35]You need to... Actually, you know what?
[129:08.77]This is what I'd do.
[129:11.09]I'd say, like, come get me, motherfucker.
[129:14.11]Like, I'm here.
[129:14.63]I'm waiting for you.
[129:15.39]And then I would throw something over there and be like, ow, my knee!
[129:18.88]Ow!
[129:19.14]Ow!
[129:20.24]I'd be like, ow, my knee!
[129:22.20]And they'd think, holy shit, he must have fallen down and gotten hit.
[129:26.04]And then he'd run over there.
[129:27.15]There's a person right there.
[129:56.70]Where's my flashlight?
[130:09.49]Oh my god, I can't see anything.
[130:15.71]Oh my god, I can't see.
[130:40.27]That's like sounds like my mic Why can't I move?
[130:46.59]I'm just gonna- wait what the-
[131:02.31]What the fuck, dude?
[131:14.56]What's wrong with my mic?
[131:15.52]What are you guys talking about?
[131:16.58]Something wrong with my mic?
[131:18.14]It's fucked up?
[131:24.06]What's wrong?
[131:36.78]What the fuck?
[131:37.96]What the fuck?
[131:38.56]What the fuck?
[131:39.20]What the fuck?
[131:45.08]This game's not even fucking scary.
[131:46.05]It's fucking easy.
[131:51.41]It all makes sense now.
[131:53.75]Lewis Kennedy wasn't killing all those women.
[132:00.32]You sound all muffled.
[132:01.40]I don't know why.
[132:02.10]I think the microphone is freaking out when I hit a certain level.
[132:06.69]Because I sound completely normal right now.
[132:09.57]But when I get to a certain audio level, it just muffles me and puts like a wall in front of my face.
[132:22.88]The mic keeps freaking out.
[132:24.36]Yeah.
[132:31.53]Is it the noise gate?
[132:34.03]I don't think it's on.
[132:37.38]Your mic is trying to smother you when you get really loud.
[132:45.26]Scream loud right now.
[132:47.94]Actually, let's find the level, right?
[132:50.46]So, like... Were those all fine?
[132:59.29]Were those fine?
[133:03.32]Yeah.
[133:04.58]Okay, so... What happened?
[133:11.40]What happened to the end there?
[133:16.97]That was fine, too.
[133:18.87]Weird.
[133:24.09]I don't know.
[133:24.69]I'll have to mess with some of the settings.
[133:28.79]She must have lost her baby, though.
[133:32.34]With almost being killed, losing her child, and being terribly burned, she completely snapped.
[133:39.46]Maybe loud, quick loud sounds freak it out?
[133:44.90]I think she has sudden loud sounds.
[133:48.42]That's like half my fucking content.
[133:51.96]She killed Louis, and then set her sights on killing others who had something she didn't.
[134:00.17]Oh, God.
[134:14.51]That was intense.
[134:15.03]That was blood wash.
[134:22.79]Isn't the Barf Drinker?
[134:24.63]It does kind of look like the Barf Drinker.
[134:31.41]It turns into a McDonald's mic eventually.
[134:34.23]Yeah, it does.
[134:37.98]That was pretty good.
[134:38.52]That was good.
[134:39.18]That was scary, interesting, creepy.
[134:43.95]I thought that was cool.
[134:47.69]Are you going to play MultiVersus?
[134:49.84]I mean, yeah.
[134:52.02]Eventually.
[134:59.70]Wait for the end.
[135:00.26]I'm not going to skip the after credits.
[135:05.00]Don't act like you were paying attention.
[135:06.66]I was.
[135:07.68]What do you mean?
[135:08.30]Of course I was.
[135:12.11]What's next after this?
[135:16.58]Hold on a minute.
[135:17.04]That's really cool.
[135:19.81]So those were custom-made comic books for this game.
[135:23.53]Is that what I'm understanding?
[135:30.30]That's pretty cool.
[135:32.62]Hold on.
[135:41.58]Well, I was pretty upset to be woken up so late for an impromptu autopsy.
[135:46.29]But when they told me that it was the actual womb ripper, well, I got down here as soon as I could.
[135:51.29]I can't believe that it turned out to be Samantha Rhodes, who'd gone missing and was presumed dead years ago.
[135:59.53]So what I did is I do what I do with all of these potential serial killer maniacs.
[136:04.33]I stand across the room first, even though they're supposed to be dead, and I throw a fucking brick as fast and as hard as I can at their head to make sure that they're not going to get up and scare me and grab me and stab me with a knife.
[136:38.25]Use boxes down the hall.
[136:39.59]Yeah, great.
[136:41.62]I wonder what happens here.
[136:43.40]You should have threw the brick.
[136:48.16]I mean, like, honestly, it's like, do we need... Just... Always keep a brick.
[136:54.23]With your... No.
[136:57.89]Goddammit, I thought it was over.
[137:08.41]Shut the fuck up.
[137:36.40]Ugh.
[137:41.42]No, don't.
[137:46.99]What the?
[137:47.29]She's gone.
[137:47.77]I have to get out of here.
[137:58.49]Cause of death.
[137:59.69]Multiple gunshot wounds.
[138:00.73]That's the official cause of death.
[138:01.83]But Jesus Christ, I don't even understand how she was still alive in the first place.
[138:06.67]I took so many shots to bring her down.
[138:07.94]Most of these look fatal on first glimpse to me.
[138:09.86]Guess we'll dig in to find out more.
[138:23.92]I... Okay, well, let's go.
[138:31.15]How does that?
[138:32.97]Done.
[138:39.86]I'm sorry, but I'm just gonna go... Right here.
[138:44.94]Right there.
[138:45.99]Just... Bang!
[138:50.81]Just... You wanna see a fucking...
[139:04.21]That was fun.
[139:06.83]You should play chess.
[139:08.03]Why would I ever play chess?
[139:11.79]I'm never going to play chess.
[139:14.72]The game is too high brain for me.
[139:16.66]It's too slow.
[139:17.54]It needs to be... Alright, if there was chess, where after every move, we got to watch a Family Guy clip.
[139:24.12]It just happened.
[139:25.65]Then okay, I'd play it.
[139:34.38]Make a Family Guy chest, and every time I move Peter Griffin, he says just a random audio clip from the show.
[139:43.29]It's very clear that they didn't record any new dialog.
[139:46.87]You move Peter.
[139:47.67]Oh, holy crap, Lois!
[139:51.43]So you didn't record any new audio for this.
[139:55.50]Stewie gets moved.
[139:57.22]Stewie just says, like, you can tell he's talking to somebody during one of the episodes.
[140:03.34]but it has nothing to do with chess he's on to something yeah no they know that that wouldn't happen it wouldn't be oh wow look at me I I'm the king lois no no no no it would be like a specific oh wow I can't believe I became mayor thanks what does that do with chess okay alright we're gonna go on we're gonna move on
[140:35.39]Play checkers.
[140:39.11]I'm not going to play checkers.
[140:41.68]Alright.
[140:42.40]I'm going to take a quick break.
[140:43.22]I'll be right back.
[140:44.72]I'm going to pee.
[140:45.16]I'm going to refill this drink.
[140:46.68]And we're going to play Murder House.
[140:48.38]That's what's on tap next.
[140:50.47]See you guys in about, I want to say two minutes.
[140:53.99]Maybe a little less.
[140:55.61]We'll find out.
[140:57.31]See you in just a moment.
[141:49.43]Oops.
[141:51.58]Hold on, let me fix it.
