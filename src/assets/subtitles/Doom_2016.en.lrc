[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.25]Okay.
[00:05.81]Uh, my microphone wasn't working.
[00:07.01]I don't know why.
[00:09.07]Hi, guys.
[00:10.67]Welcome to Doom.
[00:12.13]Gonna be playing Doom.
[00:22.10]Let's switch over now.
[00:25.74]Hey, look, a screen.
[00:35.12]So I'm going to be playing the Doom campaign.
[00:39.98]Of all things.
[00:41.36]Just came out.
[00:42.16]Why not?
[00:46.37]I have to move a couple of things around.
[00:48.43]Give me a second.
[00:53.23]Hey.
[00:54.22]Skikikikiki.
[00:55.66]Skiks.
[00:56.98]Welcome back.
[00:57.68]Seven months.
[00:58.66]Seven months.
[00:59.16]That's a long time.
[01:01.21]I think that's one of the first seven-monthers I've seen.
[01:03.47]You could be the first seven-monther.
[01:07.87]It is possible.
[01:11.95]Although I did not hear that.
[01:13.89]Why is the question?
[01:16.96]Yeah, I'm not hearing these.
[01:20.16]Do I have to restart my stream again?
[01:23.52]Mr. Kool-Aid, thanks a lot.
[01:24.90]I don't know what the hell is happening.
[01:28.71]Let's see what happens.
[01:30.17]Because now I have... Huh.
[01:33.64]I did a bunch of changes on my computer.
[01:35.02]I had to redo some things.
[01:36.58]So... Hopefully that works itself out.
[01:41.74]Otherwise I'm going to be real fucking angry.
[01:53.59]Hold on a second.
[02:01.30]Yeah, I'm gonna have to restart the stream.
[02:04.44]Again.
[02:06.78]Because my audio got all fucked up.
[02:10.32]Hold on a second.
[02:11.88]Hold on.
[02:13.18]God.
[02:13.78]I think I got it figured out.
[02:27.89]I think I gotta figure it out.
[02:30.19]I hope so, at least.
[02:36.69]God, computers are so... Computers.
[02:38.69]You know what I'm saying?
[03:01.00]I didn't think it was going to take me this long.
[03:03.36]Doom was like taking over my lines.
[03:05.48]Is what was going on.
[03:12.99]Okay.
[03:16.09]Should have it under control.
[03:19.31]Should is the question.
[03:20.95]Who knows.
[03:23.67]Anyways.
[03:29.47]Hi.
[03:33.44]I have audio here.
[03:35.24]Always a good thing.
[03:35.96]I can start the campaign, but we're going to give it a second.
[03:41.30]There we go.
[03:43.19]Awesomeness591.
[03:43.65]Thanks for the three months, dude.
[03:46.47]Sorry for the two people I missed.
[03:48.39]And I believe I just missed Tinkle Supreme.
[03:50.51]Tinkle Surprise.
[03:52.33]I think that's his name.
[03:56.88]You can't have a starting soon screen.
[03:58.96]What does it say?
[04:03.62]Be talking at the same time with no music.
[04:05.44]Yeah, you can.
[04:07.04]Why not?
[04:10.98]What a fucking catastrophe.
[04:14.03]Doom was just breaking my computer.
[04:16.27]I need a new computer.
[04:18.39]I never fold.
[04:18.93]I need a new computer.
[04:19.61]Bad.
[04:21.31]Thank you for the three months, though.
[04:24.33]Much appreciated.
[04:26.55]Wow, we're gonna get him out of the way now doggy doggy age three months.
[04:31.41]Holy shit And Abbott J. I see I can see him.
[04:36.32]I see him trickling in what they are Abbott J. There you go two months Adidas footwear you guys are these are rolling in right now everybody like subscribed at the same time.
[04:46.92]Oh
[04:48.59]Adidas footwear.
[04:49.99]We might as well turn on the facecam for this one.
[04:52.07]You know, while we have the resubs coming in.
[04:54.49]I'm going to close that door.
[04:56.29]Hi.
[04:56.93]Welcome, guys.
[04:58.25]This is going to be at John Carpenter Presents Doom, a playthrough on single player.
[05:04.10]Continue to join me while we wait it out while people trickle in.
[05:09.16]And, yeah.
[05:11.50]Hope you guys are having a good day.
[05:14.38]Didn't think you'd see a full screen facecam, did you?
[05:19.13]I surprise you every fucking day, don't I?
[05:22.69]Show them the biceps.
[05:24.61]I don't... It's not there yet.
[05:26.31]You're going to have to wait like six months.
[05:29.42]That's how long it takes.
[05:32.86]Yeah, I got a haircut too.
[05:34.58]I just got back from the gym, actually.
[05:35.90]It's been like 10 minutes since I got back.
[05:38.58]That's a lie.
[05:39.52]It's been like... Whoa, hey, what's going on?
[05:41.77]Better Mix Master, three months.
[05:42.99]Thanks a lot.
[05:44.80]It's been like an hour.
[05:46.13]I didn't even take a shower.
[05:46.97]You know, I don't even give a shit.
[05:48.13]I'm not going to the shower.
[05:50.03]We're just going to be a sweaty asshole and play Doom for like six hours.
[05:55.67]Play the multiplayer?
[05:57.12]I will.
[05:58.52]I will on my own time, I guess, on my own terms.
[06:06.60]What are you saying?
[06:09.65]Why are my lips so red?
[06:11.87]Because I'm full of blood.
[06:13.31]I'm full of blood, dude.
[06:15.45]I got blood coursing through my veins.
[06:18.73]Frozen crazy tuna.
[06:19.71]And also the lights, too.
[06:21.43]You know, it doesn't help that these are, like, beaming down on me.
[06:24.10]I swear to God, I don't have, like, lipstick on or anything.
[06:25.90]It's just the way that I am.
[06:26.80]If you can't accept me at my worst, obey your thirst.
[06:30.36]Alright, I think that's enough facecam for the day.
[06:37.32]Etalyx, Doom multiplayer sucks?
[06:39.28]Does it really?
[06:40.44]I thought it was supposed to be good.
[06:43.84]I thought it was supposed to be, like, a fun, good thing.
[06:46.22]I didn't think it was supposed to be bad.
[06:50.28]Lipstick confirmed.
[06:51.90]I get chapped lips and shit.
[06:53.52]I don't have it right now, but... Look, leave me alone.
[07:02.65]Hey, thanks.
[07:07.21]Welcome.
[07:07.63]Thank you so much, dude.
[07:09.15]I was, like, too busy to just, like, Bob my head.
[07:10.61]I didn't even know who that was.
[07:12.03]And what was his name?
[07:14.36]And... Andrew Bear!
[07:17.76]Thanks a lot, dude.
[07:19.58]Alright.
[07:20.24]Let's fucking play this game.
[07:21.66]And I'll just have you sit here awkwardly.
[07:23.30]I fucking hate face cams.
[07:25.31]Get it off.
[07:26.15]Turn it off.
[07:27.13]I don't ever want to see it again.
[07:28.73]Dr. Cheese, it's gone forever.
[07:30.93]It's never coming back.
[07:31.65]We're gonna do this like one-on-one, like I turn the camera on and just talk to you for like fucking ten seconds.
[07:36.25]And that's it.
[07:37.13]Then it goes off forever.
[07:38.45]And it never turns back on.
[07:42.95]Oh shit, Assbag.
[07:50.91]Assbag4269.
[07:51.55]Who else was that?
[07:55.10]Somebody else did it too.
[07:59.64]Sash... Sashilar.
[08:03.46]Sashilar.
[08:04.76]And the Assmaster.
[08:09.57]I fucking hate glasses.
[08:10.87]So, oh God, I look like shit.
[08:13.48]How much like shit do I look like in these, by the way?
[08:16.30]Total shit.
[08:19.64]Facecam brings in the money.
[08:22.98]Nah, it's not staying on.
[08:24.56]I fucking hate it.
[08:25.38]I can't do it.
[08:27.14]You guys like just staring at me.
[08:29.24]Just, it's just like, it makes me want to like go, like go take a fucking bath.
[08:34.48]You know what I mean?
[08:35.00]I get real awkward when I know someone's like watching me.
[08:40.75]I look like a fucking total douche.
[08:48.11]Alright.
[08:49.47]Facecam's going off.
[08:51.05]I'm gonna look like this, you know.
[08:52.21]I'm gonna look like this.
[09:06.81]Alright, let's go.
[09:08.41]Enough people have trickled in.
[09:10.59]I'll see you later.
[09:11.65]Have fun watching the stream and not my fucking stupid ass face.
[09:17.53]I have a ratty skull, little honey.
[09:20.46]I will kill you just for... Just for him!
[09:26.10]Oh shit, I missed it.
[09:27.82]Every time I go full screen... Percussive taco.
[09:31.70]Percussive.
[09:32.60]Percussive taco.
[09:36.12]Thanks for subbing.
[09:36.66]Let's play the campaign.
[09:37.74]We're just going to play campaign.
[09:41.65]Ragglefrack.
[09:42.79]Welcome back.
[09:43.43]Thank you.
[09:45.33]I'm too young to die.
[09:48.49]Ultra violence.
[09:52.33]No, I don't... I'm too young to die, guys.
[10:01.34]Let's just do regular.
[10:02.20]I don't want to do anything fucked up.
[10:06.82]Those glasses make you look like the only 40 year old to still work at Google.
[10:14.15]Oh, whatever.
[10:14.61]There we go.
[10:15.39]It comes like a cutscene.
[10:18.89]It's going to be loud as shit, so I recommend turning it down.
[10:28.50]I like the voices so far.
[10:30.76]Getting right into it here, huh?
[10:34.04]Good.
[11:01.47]Alright.
[11:02.07]Smashed his head.
[11:02.76]I'm okay with that.
[11:08.82]Already right in the game, huh?
[11:13.86]We got sensitivity issues to work out, for sure.
[11:16.30]This is pretty sick.
[11:21.51]They just get you right into the game.
[11:22.61]No messing around.
[11:23.25]I do like the voices so far.
[11:30.87]Oh, it's Cortana.
[11:31.45]Let's see what she has to say.
[11:37.66]Aliens.
[11:39.20]Fucking aliens.
[11:40.80]Get rid of them.
[11:42.04]We have to contain this.
[11:43.62]Alright, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me a sec.
[11:54.17]Something feels a little, uh... Something feels a little fucked up.
[12:02.41]Vertical sync off?
[12:04.31]Yeah, it is.
[12:06.02]So what the heck, man?
[12:09.72]Maybe my computer just sucks and I can't handle it.
[12:20.72]That's a little bit better.
[12:21.52]What's my FOV?
[12:23.11]Get that out of the way, too.
[12:24.09]95.
[12:24.11]100.
[12:25.59]Get it up to 100.
[12:26.21]What are you thinking? 100.
[12:30.92]This mouse smoothing you have to disable through the console?
[12:33.20]Really?
[12:36.46]Okay.
[12:37.98]Huh.
[12:39.24]Well, I'll have to remember that.
[12:45.00]Is that my spacesuit?
[12:49.61]Whoa.
[12:50.87]Whoa, watch out!
[12:51.59]Whoa!
[12:54.77]Oh, no.
[12:55.29]I have to make changes to mouse smoothing.
[12:59.57]Do I finally get to be Master Chief?
[13:06.87]FOV can go... 130 FOV?
[13:08.17]Holy shit.
[13:14.47]How does the stream look, by the way?
[13:16.14]Because this is a very, like, highly intense graphical game.
[13:18.52]I hope it doesn't look like shit.
[13:23.38]Casualties unavailable.
[13:24.46]Satellite dish array offline.
[13:25.82]No signal.
[13:27.82]Scanning.
[13:29.74]They're in the southwestern peninsula.
[13:30.98]Looks alright.
[13:32.98]Looks good.
[13:33.42]Don't catch who he was till he put on the mask.
[13:36.56]Kind of is pain, isn't it?
[13:41.38]That would be extremely painful for you.
[13:43.18]Whoa, I was not happy about that.
[14:01.19]I feel like you move around really fast.
[14:02.79]I want to just walk around.
[14:03.77]I feel like you go too quick.
[14:06.77]Whoa.
[14:12.19]Oh, this is getting scary.
[14:13.11]This is a scary game.
[14:14.16]I forgot.
[14:20.16]Glory kills.
[14:20.76]Dealing damage to demons will cause them to stagger, which is indicated by a blue highlight.
[14:25.42]Move into closer range, and when the highlight turns orange, press F. Fuck, I didn't read it all.
[14:34.48]Alright, so you can just kind of bash their brains in.
[14:38.76]Okay.
[14:41.99]They're teaching me it.
[14:42.69]Sometimes we'll do it.
[14:48.19]So if I hold this, is this charging it?
[14:49.89]I'm assuming.
[14:56.85]What's that?
[14:59.27]It's another gun.
[15:01.31]I'll take another gun.
[15:03.49]Sure thing.
[15:05.55]combat shotgun.
[15:07.65]Let's see it.
[15:10.47]Can they be upgraded?
[15:11.31]Is that what it is?
[15:16.10]Yeah, John Carpenter presents Doom.
[15:19.30]Okay, well, whatever.
[15:23.00]Ah, it just keeps track.
[15:24.20]A codex.
[15:24.98]Okay.
[15:25.12]Let's go.
[15:28.02]Any more monsters?
[15:31.54]Monsters?
[15:33.12]Look out.
[15:34.72]Oh, it's a... It's a licker!
[15:39.74]Easy.
[15:42.50]No mod equipped?
[15:43.72]Cool.
[15:45.04]Let's go.
[15:45.28]Oh, what is that thing?
[15:52.05]It's a giant mouth.
[15:56.79]This is actually pretty fun.
[15:58.75]Shooting monsters' heads.
[16:00.91]Wait.
[16:01.67]What?
[16:02.09]Wait.
[16:03.91]Spec tag.
[16:04.37]Welcome back, man.
[16:04.97]Three months.
[16:07.75]Very much love.
[16:09.07]Very much love.
[16:11.11]What a guy that can speak the language he can speak.
[16:15.02]Oh!
[16:17.10]Oh!
[16:18.40]Oh, that's disgusting.
[16:20.46]This game's too gross.
[16:21.92]Lockdown.
[16:22.22]Finisher.
[16:26.61]I don't want to play this game anymore.
[16:27.63]It's gross.
[16:33.64]Can I throw fireballs?
[16:39.66]Assuming these are health and ammo.
[16:45.74]That mouse moving thing is really going to... Ow.
[17:02.65]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[17:09.27]What the hell are these?
[17:11.71]Is it cash?
[17:12.85]Oh, dosh.
[17:14.29]Nice, I got some dosh.
[17:19.57]There's something I need to be doing, by the way.
[17:21.73]Do I need to just wait for the door to open?
[17:25.81]Down from there.
[17:28.77]No, you just have to kill things.
[17:29.77]It's just an arena fighter right now.
[17:38.95]I feel like the game wants me on a controller.
[17:41.13]The way that it's moving my mouse around.
[17:45.27]Is there any more money?
[17:47.49]Okay, that's a bomb.
[17:51.98]I could have probably known that by the red barrel.
[17:58.20]Some money over there, going for the long jump.
[18:03.06]Miss anything?
[18:07.99]John Carpenter presents Doom 4.
[18:09.93]You cannot be allowed to leave this place.
[18:16.16]I want to change that.
[18:18.64]I want to make that this button.
[18:27.67]Use equipment.
[18:29.21]Where is it?
[18:29.83]Where is it?
[18:30.31]Where is it?
[18:30.81]Where is it?
[18:31.29]I just had it.
[18:32.97]Where are you?
[18:34.79]Melee glory kill.
[18:35.77]Boink.
[18:37.61]What are grenades?
[18:38.13]Are there grenades in this game?
[18:40.39]Come on, show me grenade.
[18:43.75]Chainsaw.
[18:48.21]Fire weapon, weapon mod.
[18:50.53]Switch... No, actually... No, that's fine.
[18:54.86]I'll just keep it as if... Better.
[19:06.97]Set M smooth zero in the launch options.
[19:12.75]Okay, I gotta remember that.
[19:14.22]Plus set M smooth zero in the launch options.
[19:17.76]I might do that in a few minutes, but this is like the tutorial, it's fine.
[19:21.04]Yeah.
[19:44.52]Bethesda?
[19:47.34]What did Bethesda have to do with this game?
[19:52.58]Bethesda.
[19:55.24]Huh.
[19:55.74]I had no idea.
[19:56.86]I told you.
[19:57.56]I thought this was John Carpenter.
[20:01.70]Didn't the guy that made the Oculus make this?
[20:04.32]Or the guy that came with... This is gorgeous, by the way.
[20:08.48]Press tab to access your dossier.
[20:10.80]The available objectives.
[20:11.68]You can also press left to auto-intentional permission.
[20:13.84]Okay, so.
[20:16.30]Auto-map.
[20:16.88]Mission tab will show you the auto-map.
[20:19.02]Whoa.
[20:19.78]Thank you too, Bit Johnny.
[20:22.04]Welcome.
[20:22.54]Much appreciated, dude.
[20:36.33]Okay, the mission tab.
[20:38.41]Show the automap available in mission challenges and exploration items that can be found in your current mission.
[20:41.99]Okay.
[20:43.97]So, I'm just discover the cause.
[20:47.63]Whoa, that's weird.
[20:49.27]It's like a three-dimensional map.
[20:52.61]Okay.
[20:53.45]There's only like one direction I can go.
[20:59.36]This is sweet looking though.
[21:03.16]Might just take a few minutes to look around.
[21:11.34]Where am I supposed to go?
[21:12.02]Is it fall damage in this game?
[21:19.33]Alright!
[21:20.95]Okay!
[21:22.19]I'm fine.
[21:27.61]Ah shit, I just skinned my knee for a second.
[21:29.70]I'm alright.
[21:30.22]I just dropped like 50 fucking thousand feet.
[21:38.84]So you get the money.
[21:42.75]Get the money!
[21:45.39]What about bunny hopping?
[21:46.13]Bunny hopping?
[21:49.01]Yep!
[21:49.47]Look at that, bunny hopping!
[21:54.35]Codex acquired.
[21:57.91]Utopia Fox, thank you.
[21:59.40]Welcome back.
[22:00.30]Three months.
[22:02.04]Big three-monther.
[22:07.02]It's armor?
[22:07.68]Yeah, so?
[22:11.09]You put on a suit of armor and jump off a cliff.
[22:13.03]Let's see what happens.
[22:20.12]This is so awesome looking.
[22:22.16]I don't even want to play the game.
[22:23.20]I just want to be on rails.
[22:27.08]Hey, Rambone.
[22:28.20]Five months.
[22:29.02]Almost half a year.
[22:32.64]Much love, dude.
[22:33.30]Thanks.
[22:33.58]Welcome back.
[22:36.75]It's fun just getting headshots.
[22:42.92]Just stumbling around.
[22:45.26]Alright, let me look for a second.
[22:46.26]Alright, this map is kind of freaking me out.
[22:50.56]Already got that.
[22:54.10]Cycle objectives.
[22:58.15]Discover the cause, find the resource ops entrance.
[23:02.37]Find an art.
[23:13.77]This guy doesn't want to die.
[23:18.31]Mr. Moobler, welcome back two months, man.
[23:19.87]Appreciate it.
[23:27.14]Dude, I ripped that guy's arm off.
[23:30.22]And hit him in the face with it.
[23:37.63]Come here.
[23:42.57]Oh, that's so fun.
[23:44.73]Whoa, low health!
[23:45.47]Whoa!
[23:46.49]Whoa, hold on a second.
[23:50.38]Getting too busy being a dipshit.
[23:52.80]Hold on, let me just pick up all the things.
[23:59.78]What is screaming at me?
[24:03.66]Who's screaming?
[24:04.60]Maybe I shouldn't have dropped down here.
[24:22.76]Anime Jesus.
[24:25.12]The Jesus of all anime.
[24:27.12]Welcome, dude.
[24:28.12]Thanks for the sub.
[24:30.53]See ya.
[24:31.83]See ya later, bro.
[24:34.97]Alright.
[24:35.17]I feel like I should just be moving somewhere instead of just shooting these guys over and over again.
[24:44.48]I can go up this way or down here.
[24:49.19]I guess I got to go down there.
[24:50.13]I want to get all the stuff.
[25:01.82]Can I get up there?
[25:02.60]Yeah, I can.
[25:07.48]What?
[25:08.68]I very clearly hit that guy right in the head.
[25:13.05]Door not open?
[25:20.67]Give me a second.
[25:21.33]I need to see what's going on around here.
[25:23.52]There we go.
[25:26.84]Find blue access key.
[25:27.96]Find the resource ops entrance.
[25:31.12]Okay.
[25:34.66]Right click to rotate the map and press C to turn the map to 2D.
[25:39.79]Thank you, Hypo.
[25:40.99]Because I would have never fa- I- I- Alright.
[25:44.93]I'd much rather the 2D version.
[25:48.25]So, we're just gonna go this way.
[25:51.66]Down the cave.
[25:52.30]The hell is that?
[25:59.16]We got access keys, boys, yeah.
[26:03.48]Oh, shit, a colleague!
[26:05.60]One of my colleagues!
[26:11.78]I always break stuff.
[26:12.50]You never know when you're gonna need to break it.
[26:17.22]Damn.
[26:22.47]Who's making that noise?
[26:23.33]Looks like somebody's coming out of the generator.
[26:27.51]Okay.
[26:33.25]Oh, there he is.
[26:34.67]You alright?
[26:36.67]Keycard.
[26:39.30]Found the keycard.
[26:41.82]Mr. Squishy, thanks for three months, man.
[26:43.26]Welcome back.
[26:45.95]Welcome back, Mr. Squishy.
[26:47.13]I feel like this might be just a little... a little too loud.
[26:58.40]Is that better?
[27:03.92]Better.
[27:06.24]That's my opinion on Google Earth.
[27:09.35]Google Earth.
[27:12.65]Left control.
[27:14.96]Yeah, that's got to change.
[27:17.32]That's going to go to my other mouse button on my thumb.
[27:22.80]I mean, Google Earth is kind of cool.
[27:24.42]I guess.
[27:25.92]It's alright.
[27:29.13]So I'm going to make that a different mouse button.
[27:36.13]Use equipment.
[27:39.49]Left control on mouse 3.
[27:41.94]Actually, you know, Mouse 3 is not terrible.
[27:46.93]But I'll put it on Mouse 5.
[27:53.41]Hold on.
[27:56.15]Hold on.
[27:56.88]I'm going to change that.
[28:04.36]I always have such trouble with my key bindings.
[28:10.92]Where are you?
[28:14.24]Where are you?
[28:15.94]There you are.
[28:19.71]Now let's make melee.
[28:24.85]This.
[28:25.39]Okay.
[28:27.47]I should be happy with this now.
[28:30.69]Yeah.
[28:31.31]Okay.
[28:33.40]Hypo's telling me I'm missing all kinds of secrets and shit.
[28:37.56]Maybe I'll go back and look.
[28:41.66]Secret.
[28:43.98]Secret.
[28:45.96]How do I get it?
[28:46.40]How do I Mario wall jump over there?
[28:54.93]I can get up there.
[28:57.33]Come on.
[28:57.55]There's a secret up there.
[28:58.19]I can see it.
[28:58.57]Hold on.
[29:02.43]I think I can make that.
[29:05.95]Shit.
[29:06.19]I don't think I can.
[29:11.89]Come on.
[29:14.69]There we go.
[29:16.57]Secret.
[29:20.61]What does that do?
[29:24.62]Combat shotgun model?
[29:27.08]Best chin in North America.
[29:29.48]You have the best chin and you're back for two months.
[29:32.46]Thank you.
[29:34.76]There are two UIC Marine Guy collectibles in every map.
[29:37.50]Each one you will find will unlock a model that can be viewed by visiting the collectibles menu.
[29:42.30]See if you can find them all!
[29:44.78]The collectibles menu can be viewed after you select them.
[29:46.50]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:48.62]Get it off with this.
[29:49.42]We can keep moving.
[30:06.59]Play the game only with your facecam on and describe what you're seeing.
[30:12.03]That would be a terrible live stream.
[30:15.91]That would be such an awful live stream.
[30:17.83]I would never want to watch that stream.
[30:22.77]That is so awesome.
[30:23.69]You can just jump down on somebody.
[30:25.53]What's my objective?
[30:29.54]Find the resource ops entrance.
[30:36.55]This 3D map really is freaking me the fuck out.
[30:38.29]Can I get in there?
[30:47.92]Come on, I've watched the Hydraulic Press YouTube channel.
[30:50.30]I want to see what happens to me.
[30:53.90]Do I squish up all over the place and curl up like the clay?
[30:58.27]I don't know.
[31:06.41]It's so easy to kill.
[31:07.41]Look at this.
[31:08.35]There's nothing.
[31:14.77]Look over here.
[31:15.39]I don't want to miss anything.
[31:16.39]Can I jump up there?
[31:27.66]Yeah, I can.
[31:31.84]Oh, I just was up here.
[31:33.25]Okay.
[31:34.71]What a fool.
[31:38.14]What a fool.
[31:44.86]Slowly but surely, don't rush it.
[31:49.61]Something's gonna happen here.
[31:50.99]Guaranteed.
[31:51.39]Let's try the grenade.
[31:55.51]Let's see how it works.
[31:56.33]Okay, it's pretty quick.
[32:02.71]Actually, very quick.
[32:08.10]Checkpoint.
[32:13.37]Can I grab this?
[32:16.27]I guess not.
[32:18.49]Weapon cache.
[32:23.49]I can wrap around.
[32:25.33]That was a lot of money.
[32:28.03]Nice money.
[32:32.88]This is tagged as anime and dating sim.
[32:36.02]Why?
[32:37.06]Does this make any sense?
[32:41.31]Secret!
[32:45.02]Yeah, I got his USB data port.
[32:48.88]The Praetor Suit tab allows you to upgrade a variety of the Praetor Suit's capabilities.
[32:52.74]Here you can spend Praetor Suit tokens on available upgrades and view requirements to unlock remaining categories.
[33:01.10]Alright.
[33:04.15]So these are the upgrades.
[33:04.89]I already like it.
[33:07.29]The game's got upgrades.
[33:08.15]I love upgrades.
[33:12.06]Explosive damage.
[33:14.46]Can I just put straight up points into health?
[33:16.48]Can I just do that?
[33:19.24]Weapon upgrade points.
[33:20.36]Arsenal.
[33:24.20]Kind of a lot going on here.
[33:29.31]Cool.
[33:32.31]And then make sure up here, guys, make sure you save your work.
[33:36.77]It's vital.
[33:37.57]You don't want to lose it, so make sure you save and then save as.
[33:40.45]Alright, save.
[33:43.57]I don't care about that really at all.
[33:45.79]But I do want to go back to this.
[33:51.49]I mean, might as well just do it, right?
[33:53.45]Wait, what?
[33:57.55]Renee?
[33:59.10]Renee?
[34:01.84]Thank you for the two months, Renee.
[34:03.24]Everyone say hi to Renee.
[34:11.44]If you have not followed Renee, go do it right now.
[34:16.48]She's a streamer.
[34:17.84]She's awesome.
[34:20.02]I refuse to continue playing the game until at least 500 of you follow Renee.
[34:27.63]Consider her all fucking day.
[34:29.95]It's some kind of goddamn joke.
[34:37.91]So what...
[34:39.87]I can put two into this.
[34:41.61]I think I get it.
[34:45.75]I think I understand.
[34:48.31]Let's go.
[34:53.42]Holding you hostage.
[34:57.98]And then Dragon Breath.
[35:00.58]Breathing fire and shit for three months.
[35:02.26]You've been breathing fire for three months, dude.
[35:04.74]That's a lot of months of fire.
[35:17.03]Thank you, Kyle.
[35:18.89]What did I just pick up from this thing, by the way?
[35:20.63]I have no idea.
[35:22.93]But welcome Kyle.
[35:24.97]TS8.
[35:29.23]What the fuck did I get out of this?
[35:30.25]I was too busy looking at, like, chat.
[35:32.03]What a dummy.
[35:41.06]Can I do anything?
[35:41.60]No.
[35:42.90]Let's just go.
[35:43.38]I need to find my way out of here.
[35:47.64]Jeremy's not very good at holding hostages.
[35:51.88]No, I'm not.
[35:52.84]Not really.
[35:54.62]Looks like I can go this way.
[35:57.51]This way.
[36:00.57]Elite guards?
[36:02.85]Oh, okay.
[36:06.70]No, I wanna go... Wasn't that like an elevator right here?
[36:09.97]Like, what the fuck did I get out of this?
[36:11.17]I was not even paying attention.
[36:15.03]Melody Z, welcome.
[36:18.13]Thank you so much.
[36:29.65]Welcome to the group of people that love to play John Carpenter Presents the Thing.
[36:35.90]What the fuck was that behind me?
[36:37.04]Oh, it's just a magician.
[36:39.68]Don't worry.
[36:41.74]It's just a shitty magician.
[36:44.22]Give me a map.
[36:46.14]Okay, cool.
[36:48.56]Alright.
[36:48.84]Let me look over here.
[36:55.25]What mic do I use?
[36:56.23]It is a Neumann.
[36:58.54]Neumann TLM.
[37:01.08]Or TLS.
[37:03.70]102.
[37:05.96]Pretty good.
[37:07.38]It was expensive as all shit.
[37:08.46]It better be good, right?
[37:10.82]Let me get my little cars here.
[37:13.22]Three cars.
[37:13.91]Wow, nice.
[37:15.83]A box of cars?
[37:19.91]Those grenades...
[37:25.00]Yep.
[37:26.40]Had to just see.
[37:36.07]I'm gonna get in the boat and just take off.
[37:41.37]Lot of stuff over here.
[37:45.46]Can't open you?
[37:58.90]I guess I can go down?
[38:03.52]Super awkward.
[38:06.87]I'm gonna go down.
[38:07.47]Or are we?
[38:08.87]Do I have to make a jump here?
[38:13.55]Maybe.
[38:17.13]I don't think I'm supposed to go this way.
[38:18.33]Let me look at this again.
[38:30.97]Find the resource ops entrance.
[38:34.21]Where the fuck is that?
[38:36.13]Over here?
[38:36.49]I think that's it right there, right?
[38:45.17]Was it legend?
[38:46.86]Does that mean I gotta go that way?
[38:52.62]You've so much to live for.
[38:53.56]I guess I do.
[39:00.63]This isn't Dark Souls.
[39:01.53]Try jumping is not going to work.
[39:11.70]I feel like I have to go that way.
[39:12.78]I have no idea.
[39:24.59]Try rolling.
[39:29.96]Probably should have paid attention to where, like, what the checkpoints actually look like.
[39:36.36]Oh, where's, like, the actual legend?
[39:37.64]I just want to make sure I'm going the right way.
[39:38.96]Yeah, it's right there.
[39:40.29]Okay, so I have to go over here.
[39:44.13]So how do I get over there?
[39:47.75]With my anthill map.
[39:50.25]Seriously.
[39:50.71]Is this a map or is this a science project?
[39:56.33]With fucking ants.
[39:59.52]Go up here and take a left.
[40:03.20]We'll go this way and take a left.
[40:07.08]Come on, get me back up here.
[40:07.96]Get the fuck off me.
[40:11.72]Forklift, screw you.
[40:15.77]Oh!
[40:17.15]I thought I was dead.
[40:17.83]What the hell is this?
[40:23.49]Combat support drone.
[40:27.02]Field drones will supply you with weapon mods that can be activated by using weapon mod button.
[40:31.22]Choose which mod you want and be attached to your weapon.
[40:33.46]Okay.
[40:36.87]I kind of want the charge shot.
[40:37.87]That seems cool.
[40:40.89]Somewhat cool, at least.
[40:41.77]Put it on.
[40:50.92]Put it on.
[40:51.32]I want to put this shit on.
[40:58.30]Charge up a three-round burst or... Arcing Explosive.
[41:02.24]I like the three-round burst.
[41:03.30]That sounds like fun.
[41:07.32]What a dick.
[41:07.82]I really just punched the thing in the fucking face?
[41:16.18]Alright, let's go.
[41:16.60]Let's give that a try.
[41:18.78]Cool.
[41:27.25]Long recharge though.
[41:28.27]A lot going on over here.
[41:33.35]I'm gonna come, I'm gonna get that guy.
[41:38.77]Get me up there.
[41:42.31]Oh, fuck you.
[41:42.97]Hold on, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[41:46.17]I don't want to die in the tutorial map.
[41:49.05]That would be embarrassing.
[41:55.19]Blend in with the background.
[41:57.66]You don't eat shit.
[41:59.76]Checkpoint!
[42:02.88]Ooh!
[42:24.31]Oh, people everywhere.
[42:26.23]People everywhere.
[42:27.61]Go back.
[42:28.53]Go back.
[42:32.79]Okay, this is... The game might start here.
[42:34.81]Nice try.
[42:38.26]Nice try.
[42:39.62]Hit him.
[42:45.12]Cave.
[42:50.08]Cave.
[42:51.94]Always go in the cave.
[42:53.42]It's really important.
[42:54.20]I gotta be almost there, right?
[43:07.98]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[43:19.77]Get outta here.
[43:27.23]That guy didn't even have a chance.
[43:28.53]Oh, low ammo.
[43:42.20]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[43:44.22]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[43:47.90]Oh, oh.
[43:57.96]Damn, that was nice.
[44:01.61]Damn.
[44:02.67]Oh, damn.
[44:03.59]Did you see that?
[44:07.43]Oh.
[44:09.49]Oh, damn.
[44:11.04]Can I say something else?
[44:15.76]What the fuck are you doing?
[44:16.76]That guy just let me shoot him in the back.
[44:24.61]Damn.
[44:32.83]Damn.
[44:35.21]Where am I going?
[44:37.95]Okay.
[44:38.61]Back here.
[44:41.19]How do I get... How do I get up there again?
[44:49.82]Chili Roe is 13.
[44:52.42]Another 7-Monther.
[44:54.00]Another 7-Monther.
[44:54.68]I'm trying to fucking talk to somebody.
[44:56.64]Get the fuck out of here.
[45:04.14]Okay.
[45:06.42]Uh, Chili Rose.
[45:08.42]That's a seven month subscription.
[45:09.64]That's kind of crazy.
[45:10.44]That's almost a year.
[45:11.18]Uh, much love.
[45:14.06]Thank you.
[45:14.38]Checkpoint reach.
[45:14.96]I haven't moved.
[45:16.74]I have not moved.
[45:17.36]This is it, right?
[45:27.09]Oh, that's a huge piece of money.
[45:28.75]I just got a huge money bag.
[45:34.23]What?
[45:34.59]I fucking could have... I could have grabbed that shit.
[45:36.13]Come on.
[45:43.50]Guess I can keep going up.
[45:44.36]I don't have to do that if I don't need to.
[45:47.28]Hey.
[45:49.84]Is somebody shooting a cannon?
[45:51.26]Don't shoot a cannon at me, dude.
[45:54.06]Not that big of a deal.
[45:54.82]I'm just a guy.
[46:03.14]Slow it down.
[46:04.22]Slow it down.
[46:05.68]No reason to get yourself killed from the money.
[46:09.59]Nice.
[46:09.83]I just realized something.
[46:14.07]That's not money at all.
[46:16.81]It's armor.
[46:17.81]That is actually like... I thought it was like cash.
[46:21.77]What a fucking idiot.
[46:26.73]My missile is short.
[46:33.93]Am I like four feet tall?
[46:35.34]Look at this.
[46:38.68]I am like four foot eight.
[46:40.26]Alright.
[46:40.86]Did it.
[46:41.16]Next area.
[47:06.91]I thought you were joking when you saw the shield and said that's just a big bag of money.
[47:15.44]Well, I was kidding there, but not later on.
[47:20.75]That's a big bag of money.
[47:24.89]Let's get the fucking facecam on, huh?
[47:32.99]Oh shit, I just lost it.
[47:37.07]I'm fucking red.
[47:39.11]Am I really like this red right now?
[47:41.29]I shouldn't be.
[47:45.62]It's the lights.
[47:46.34]I'm telling you.
[47:47.16]I'm not this red usually.
[47:48.20]I'm just a little flustered.
[47:49.66]You get flustered when you play video games, guys.
[47:51.68]It happens.
[47:55.07]Okay.
[47:55.85]Why am I still loading?
[47:57.51]Shouldn't this have ended by now?
[48:01.47]Oh!
[48:10.59]Are you in a basement?
[48:12.97]No, this is my recording place.
[48:15.10]My recording studio.
[48:16.16]Fuck, who was that?
[48:17.14]Am I still loading in this game?
[48:20.20]Why is this taking so long?
[48:26.70]Fuck, who just subscribed?
[48:27.72]I lost it.
[48:32.15]Hyperon Rising.
[48:33.17]Hyperon Rising, thank you.
[48:37.44]Fucking God, hit space.
[48:51.95]Fuck you, Vega.
[48:54.47]Did you just get embarrassed like I just did?
[48:58.21]It appears that I can activate optional challenges that when completed will assist in upgrading your arsenal.
[49:08.08]You're looking a bit flush there, Jeremiah.
[49:11.74]It's because I'm under lights.
[49:13.96]And I'm under distress.
[49:19.68]Mission challenges are activated when a mission begins.
[49:23.30]Weapon upgrade points and all that.
[49:24.67]Who cares?
[49:25.15]Let's go.
[49:27.95]Kill two of the possessed with one trigger pull from a shotgun.
[49:33.35]Five different glory kills or find three secrets.
[49:38.13]Okay.
[49:41.85]But, uh, no, Renee, this is, uh... Stop blushing.
[49:46.07]I can't help it!
[49:47.13]Whenever I turn the... I can't use facecam.
[49:49.13]I'm too scared.
[49:49.91]I'm too self-conscious.
[49:50.85]Uh, but Renee, this room... is, uh... technically is in a basement.
[50:00.70]It's not my mother's, though, I promise.
[50:06.43]Or do I?
[50:12.92]Get blown up.
[50:18.52]Do I get to drive a car in this game?
[50:19.60]I hope so.
[50:21.82]He's going to jump right at my face.
[50:25.54]Whoa.
[50:26.66]Get out of here.
[50:32.18]Wait, wait, wait.
[50:32.62]Hold on.
[50:32.82]I got to kill two people with one shotgun, right?
[50:36.94]There you go.
[50:37.80]Two dudes.
[50:39.10]They're screaming like there are 30 people here.
[50:40.94]It's only two.
[50:43.14]Get over here.
[50:45.94]Stupid fucking slug people.
[50:47.64]Here we go.
[50:49.06]You fucking idiots.
[50:53.02]Oh, you dumb fucks.
[50:54.74]No.
[51:03.76]I did it.
[51:07.84]Weapon upgrade point.
[51:08.70]Okay.
[51:13.54]Let's go do it.
[51:18.68]Speedy recovery... Recharge time.
[51:22.26]Fire rate of the burst.
[51:24.24]What about this gun?
[51:27.00]Eh.
[51:27.66]That's not that cool.
[51:32.59]Jerma's not cute, guys.
[51:33.69]He's a small guy who's shy about wearing his new glasses and blushing his natural not-cute one bit.
[51:39.15]I'm not sure if that's a compliment or if that is a shade being thrown.
[51:46.68]Calum.
[51:51.50]Another seven-month-old.
[51:53.92]El Pepperoni, thanks a lot, man.
[51:55.36]Welcome.
[51:57.12]Thanks a lot.
[51:57.54]El Pepperoni, I love you.
[51:59.17]Thank you.
[52:01.45]Welcome back to the fucking green tomato fucking facecam shitheads.
[52:05.57]Actually, I will get that.
[52:06.33]I feel like I need to use it more often.
[52:21.83]This game's really red.
[52:24.17]You guys notice that?
[52:25.55]It's a very red game.
[52:27.33]Red and orange.
[52:38.48]She's not talking.
[52:41.54]What is going on?
[52:42.16]She just got angry.
[52:48.51]She just got mad at me for doing that.
[52:51.61]Oh, this is fucking scary.
[52:53.03]Look at this lady's face.
[52:54.21]She's terrifying me.
[53:03.11]Okay, I'm getting the story.
[53:12.87]Got it.
[53:15.29]Alright.
[53:17.01]Now what do I do?
[53:18.34]Where do I go now?
[53:35.10]There she comes.
[53:37.76]Now she's... Was she back on the computer?
[53:40.25]Hold on.
[53:41.99]I'm gonna go check something.
[53:47.21]No, it's just a bunch of fucking arteries.
[53:49.25]Okay, I got the map.
[54:02.80]Uh, whatever.
[54:05.43]I guess somebody else will read it.
[54:07.93]Alright, let's do it.
[54:19.91]Have I managed to fuck up every game I play?
[54:23.17]I don't know.
[54:27.21]Is she still talking to me?
[54:28.73]She's still talking.
[54:29.37]There's too many noises!
[54:35.93]Is anybody else getting freaked out by how many sounds are going on right now?
[54:40.26]It's like I want to turn them off.
[54:43.40]This game is too much.
[54:44.26]Oh shit, hold on.
[54:50.72]There we go, that's what I want.
[54:54.91]What?
[54:55.37]What the fuck am I?
[54:58.89]Give me the money suit!
[55:00.67]Give me the- I'm fucking stuck!
[55:10.17]Maddie Calde.
[55:11.89]Thank you.
[55:12.29]A whole lot of weird shit was just going on right there.
[55:15.07]I couldn't move, I wanted to get the money suit.
[55:19.90]But uh, thank you, welcome.
[55:22.58]And she's still talking.
[55:26.32]Game sucks.
[55:31.44]I was legit stuck there.
[55:32.46]I couldn't move.
[55:32.96]I promise you that.
[55:35.74]I promise.
[55:40.64]Let's not have that happen again.
[55:43.33]We're gonna go get the money suit.
[55:45.33]Let's run by.
[55:48.51]I'm gonna do the speedrun strategies.
[55:53.85]There it is.
[55:54.49]Nice.
[55:56.44]Made out of Washingtons.
[56:02.08]God, it's too many enemies.
[56:03.32]Oops.
[56:27.17]Oops.
[56:28.17]I didn't mean to do that.
[56:28.99]It's okay.
[56:29.27]Okay.
[56:31.60]We're gonna be fine.
[56:34.18]Press space!
[56:38.24]Get good.
[56:40.20]How embarrassing.
[56:56.00]You guys ready to watch me embarrass myself?
[56:57.96]All night?
[56:59.46]It's gonna happen.
[57:01.68]It's gonna happen.
[57:03.72]I hit that guy in the head.
[57:14.37]I just like wrecked that guy in the head with the grenade.
[57:19.79]What the fuck is that?
[57:28.42]Faraldo25, thank you for subscribing dude.
[57:32.35]Welcome.
[57:33.91]Welcome.
[57:35.95]Okay, I'm getting a little overwhelmed here.
[57:40.79]I'm not gonna lie.
[57:42.37]Hypo's telling me to look for secrets.
[57:44.93]I can barely even function right now.
[57:53.99]It's too... Give me that cassette tape.
[57:57.46]Area locked down.
[57:58.10]I have to kill everything in here.
[58:02.18]Easier said than done.
[58:06.17]Nice.
[58:19.22]I feel like this is really loud.
[58:21.41]Is it?
[58:22.01]Am I?
[58:22.29]Is it way louder than me talking?
[58:24.33]I kind of feel like it is.
[58:28.81]Who's left?
[58:36.82]Jayrastics.
[58:43.72]Thank you, dude.
[58:44.24]Welcome.
[58:46.70]No, it's not too loud?
[58:47.48]Okay.
[58:47.62]It just feels like it is.
[58:52.70]That's a chainsaw.
[58:54.84]That's a chainsaw.
[58:56.82]That's a chainsaw.
[58:59.74]Don't ever give a psycho like me a chainsaw.
[59:03.12]Don't ever do it.
[59:06.50]Versus G. Requires fuel to bigger the demon, the more you need.
[59:10.45]Cutting apart the demon with a chainsaw will always drop a surplus of ammunition.
[59:16.46]Oh man, I can't wait.
[59:21.19]This is gonna be awesome.
[59:22.49]Get outta here.
[59:28.41]I'm just gonna, you guys wanna see speedrun strategies?
[59:31.65]You wanna see going fast?
[59:33.37]Do you wanna see how fast we go?
[59:36.39]Easy.
[59:45.77]Did I run out of fuel?
[59:47.19]What is all this?
[59:47.89]What's all the gold pieces?
[60:08.12]I like this game.
[60:08.84]It's fun.
[60:09.72]I went a little too fast.
[60:11.08]Just a little bit.
[60:13.14]You're fucking hopeless.
[60:20.17]I'm fine.
[60:21.09]Don't worry.
[60:21.45]Take care of it.
[60:27.99]Take care of it, guys.
[60:29.91]Don't worry.
[60:31.72]Get the fuck out of here.
[60:34.20]Wait, I'm already dead.
[60:35.14]I'm already dead.
[60:36.02]What is burning me?
[60:38.84]Which one of these guys has the insta-light-you-on-fire move and you die instantly?
[60:41.94]What.
[60:42.36]What am I doing wrong?
[60:45.72]What just happened?
[60:51.12]There's not even any time for me to know.
[60:53.44]Is this room full of gas?
[61:01.99]Is this room, like, full of... Hold on.
[61:03.97]I need to, like, investigate this.
[61:09.61]Is that oil?
[61:12.55]Oh, that's what was going on.
[61:13.51]I was getting shocked.
[61:14.11]I was getting zapped.
[61:15.18]Okay.
[61:20.26]Who's this guy?
[61:21.14]Alright, I'm not going to fuck around now.
[61:31.02]Hey, hey.
[61:34.70]No, I'm not going for a melee kill.
[61:36.36]Just give me the... Shit.
[61:37.88]Shit.
[61:53.49]Salty Riley, thank you.
[61:56.05]Thank you so much, dude.
[61:57.07]Welcome.
[61:57.89]Okay.
[61:58.30]That was a hard room.
[61:59.58]For some reason.
[62:01.48]Train!
[62:01.80]Do I get to ride the train?
[62:18.57]I need a yellow key.
[62:22.09]Come on, I don't want a yellow key.
[62:23.47]Should I follow this guy?
[62:30.77]I think I gotta follow this dude.
[62:34.67]Well, you didn't open the door for me.
[62:38.40]Okay.
[62:39.72]Yellow card.
[62:42.44]Hmm.
[62:45.24]Hold on a second.
[62:49.41]What does that mean?
[62:57.63]Money suit?
[62:58.73]I would gladly take a money suit right now.
[63:04.73]I shouldn't be standing here.
[63:05.49]I feel like there's something to do with this, though.
[63:09.01]Gas can?
[63:13.18]Whoa.
[63:15.58]Oh, shit.
[63:17.08]Thank God.
[63:17.56]I thought they were, like, gassing me in here.
[63:20.24]Alright, let's go.
[63:20.80]Elevator up.
[63:21.38]I feel like I'm playing Aliens.
[63:40.43]Whoa.
[63:44.03]Easy now.
[63:45.29]Easy now.
[63:48.89]Who's doing that?
[63:51.20]Shut up!
[63:53.58]Shut up!
[63:56.88]Shut up!
[63:59.86]Oh, are there two of you down there, or two hundred?
[64:09.03]Boss Cod Bear.
[64:10.63]Basket Bear.
[64:11.99]Basket Bear.
[64:13.47]Welcome back.
[64:13.99]Thank you so much, dude.
[64:14.75]Two months!
[64:15.91]It's your second month anniversary.
[64:23.58]Shit.
[64:25.12]Lock doors everywhere.
[64:25.96]Get some of that money.
[64:38.55]This is a busy room.
[64:40.45]Very busy room.
[64:41.53]I'm just going to stay here for a minute.
[64:47.19]Destroy the core nest.
[64:49.09]Got it.
[64:53.16]It didn't, okay.
[64:54.92]It didn't explode, like I thought it was.
[64:56.36]Get it!
[65:02.38]Get it.
[65:12.43]Chainsaw.
[65:13.37]Chainsaw is cool.
[65:15.03]Quick, get the gold!
[65:21.21]Oh, shit.
[65:40.06]This game is intense, man.
[65:41.38]It really is.
[65:48.25]Hale, they run away from you.
[65:49.17]They really do run away from you.
[65:50.97]They turn and they sprint.
[65:57.50]Where is he?
[65:57.80]Where'd he go?
[66:00.78]Yikes.
[66:01.23]Run, run, run, run, run.
[66:11.36]That's my favorite one.
[66:12.08]I love jumping down on them.
[66:21.69]Thankfully there's health packs everywhere.
[66:35.58]Oh, no.
[66:36.98]Do not.
[66:38.06]Do not.
[66:38.98]Help, help, help, help, help.
[66:40.74]Big help.
[66:46.76]Are you invincible when you do that?
[66:47.80]I feel like you should be.
[66:52.05]Dude, I shot that guy so bad, he shipped blue pellets.
[66:54.67]That's how you know I'm doing well.
[67:05.73]Dammit, they just spawn everywhere.
[67:07.23]How much longer do I have to do this for?
[67:13.00]Lock me in a room with a bunch of psychopaths.
[67:24.49]Where's the big one?
[67:25.15]When's the giant guy gonna come out and like throw up all over the place and it's acid and you can't touch it?
[67:36.38]Pretty radical.
[67:41.15]You done?
[67:43.27]Where's this guy again?
[67:47.41]Facecam?
[67:48.35]No.
[67:49.71]No.
[67:54.55]No facecam.
[67:55.61]No.
[67:57.97]No.
[68:01.27]Take a moment to wipe the sweat from your slippery body.
[68:07.63]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[68:08.71]You're right.
[68:12.13]Hold on.
[68:12.35]I've got to move this.
[68:19.39]Okay, I can see now.
[68:25.96]I feel like Jerm is fond of the weak-ass pistol.
[68:28.10]I am.
[68:28.48]That's pretty good.
[68:31.20]It works when it needs to.
[68:42.52]Did I just kill his body?
[68:47.23]Is that why he just... Ah, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[68:52.75]I already have one.
[68:54.89]Can I unlock the other one?
[68:56.61]Do I have another weapon mod thing yet?
[69:03.86]Three.
[69:04.14]I have one.
[69:04.70]I'll buy this one.
[69:11.49]Because I am using this little dinky pistol more often.
[69:15.42]Might as well.
[69:18.62]What difficulty is this on?
[69:19.64]This is just on normal.
[69:23.76]I think I just want to try to.
[69:28.35]So now this one is... How do you activate this one?
[69:33.05]Wouldn't even pay attention.
[69:36.13]Pressing R. Oh.
[69:39.62]That's cool.
[69:43.23]That one's a little different.
[69:47.57]Alright.
[69:49.13]Shall we?
[69:51.47]Yellow key card?
[69:53.09]I think so.
[69:54.98]Fuck, I'm just... Don't fuck around.
[69:57.76]Look at his foot.
[70:04.94]His final moments.
[70:06.12]He was doing what he loved.
[70:07.66]Tap dancing.
[70:08.60]Tap dancing.
[70:12.08]I know he was, Orthacon.
[70:13.32]He was.
[70:16.53]Seven months.
[70:18.05]Welcome back, man.
[70:18.77]That's a very long time.
[70:22.11]And Leather Jacket.
[70:23.51]Jacket, thanks a lot, dude.
[70:24.29]Welcome back again.
[70:25.83]One of the mods of this channel.
[70:33.06]Thanks a lot, dude, for your continued sticking around.
[70:37.10]All of you.
[70:43.26]Thank you very much.
[70:43.87]I really am getting a big aliens vibe from this.
[70:48.71]You got a new gun.
[70:49.95]This guy gonna jump at me too?
[70:51.31]Heavy assault rifle.
[70:52.15]This thing's nice.
[71:12.40]Okay, there's a weapon wheel now.
[71:16.78]I like it.
[71:19.42]I like it.
[71:29.77]Money suit.
[71:33.06]And... Shock jocker.
[71:37.66]Excellent.
[71:39.10]What the hell does this do?
[71:46.01]It's just healing.
[71:46.87]Okay.
[71:48.83]Whatever.
[71:50.31]Well, hold on.
[71:50.81]What does that do?
[71:53.83]Cycling airlock.
[72:00.66]What's going here?
[72:01.46]Open.
[72:01.76]It's a blood pressure machine?
[72:16.95]That's what it looked like.
[72:25.30]Ooh, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[72:26.40]Double, double, double, double, double.
[72:29.96]Did I play the original Doom?
[72:31.21]Yes, I am an old piece of shit.
[72:34.93]And I was around when the original Doom was not really a thing, but it was still playable.
[72:44.40]Low ammo.
[72:49.69]Barely dodged that one.
[73:03.15]Gas can.
[73:03.57]Do I have full gas?
[73:04.39]I don't really want to waste that, though.
[73:09.90]Seems like a waste.
[73:11.78]To just spam that ship.
[73:16.89]And I played Wolfenstein.
[73:18.13]Yes.
[73:19.51]Wolfenstein.
[73:20.33]Wolfenstein.
[73:21.05]So I think I'm noticing the difference here.
[73:29.93]If you... When they glow a different color, the ammo drops out?
[73:32.97]Or is my crazy?
[73:41.10]And a shield?
[73:45.18]It took a lot of hits.
[73:59.38]That guy just threw a grenade.
[74:00.68]Is that an enemy?
[74:01.92]Is this like fire thing or an enemy here?
[74:03.78]I'm confused.
[74:10.71]Get this guy.
[74:13.13]Nice.
[74:19.59]This is just too much adrenaline.
[74:28.26]They're really kind of sticky in arenas, don't they, in this game?
[74:30.64]In the single player.
[74:35.52]Vine Thulu.
[74:38.49]Welcome back, Vine Thulu.
[74:44.71]Almost jumped off the edge.
[74:46.92]Came pretty close.
[74:50.12]Not gonna lie.
[74:55.82]Thank you for your $5.
[74:58.38]You spent $5.
[75:04.12]Thank you very much.
[75:11.03]Did I do it?
[75:15.27]I think I did, because here is the elevator, right?
[75:19.31]Looks like it.
[75:22.77]Jerry almost did a Jerma again.
[75:24.15]Yeah, there's two different people.
[75:26.84]You're much better at this than Siege, so at least there's that.
[75:30.20]God.
[75:32.39]It is like... I think Siege is the worst game I've ever been.
[75:36.19]Like, I've been the worst at Siege out of any video game I've ever played in my entire life.
[75:45.39]When we play that game, I must look like such a child.
[75:50.99]Like, I'm playing on my older brother's computer.
[75:52.99]Uh-oh, dead guy.
[76:01.75]What's the point of that?
[76:04.75]You're not that bad.
[76:05.75]I mean, it's... Siege is fun, though.
[76:09.79]Somebody just fell off the roof.
[76:11.98]Did somebody just fall off the roof?
[76:16.10]You guys saw that, right?
[76:19.64]Some dude just fell off the roof.
[76:23.88]Wasting ammo.
[76:24.42]What a dummy.
[76:31.38]So what you're saying is there'll be a siege video soon?
[76:33.34]No.
[76:34.02]No.
[76:41.61]Hello?
[76:42.21]What's going on?
[76:44.61]Now where do I have to go?
[76:45.29]Over here?
[76:52.30]Do I claim these or what?
[76:54.06]How do I get those?
[76:57.68]That way.
[77:00.27]So, to get that way, I have to go all the way back, huh?
[77:07.24]Oh, fuck.
[77:08.06]Okay, so out here and then left.
[77:09.64]Whatever, we're just gonna go.
[77:10.44]Hey, at least I have, uh, Renee.
[77:18.94]I have people like you to carry me.
[77:20.44]You guys can carry me.
[77:21.26]You and your team.
[77:35.71]This guy's running away.
[77:42.81]Why are they smart?
[77:46.12]You shouldn't be that smart.
[77:51.08]Hello.
[77:52.80]Hello.
[77:58.96]Money suit.
[78:00.00]Thank you.
[78:01.63]Make sure I'm going the right way.
[78:04.45]Welcome, Zach.
[78:16.60]Thank you for subbing.
[78:18.20]Thank you for subbing.
[78:24.78]Run away.
[78:32.32]Okay.
[78:39.26]Backseat gaming is against the rules.
[78:40.66]Can't carry you.
[78:41.26]That's not backseat gaming.
[78:44.88]That's playing a game that you are terrible at and having somebody else play better than you so you can enjoy the video game.
[78:54.81]I might be in some danger here.
[79:03.34]Thank God they drop health.
[79:13.77]I'm so used to hitting R to reload that I'm just reloading.
[79:15.97]Ooh.
[79:20.55]Daddy like.
[79:23.16]Okay, that was weird.
[79:24.52]Wait, what?
[79:28.12]Laddie596, seven months.
[79:29.90]Thank you so much.
[79:32.09]It's a long time.
[79:33.73]I didn't have anything else to say.

[79:39.66]I'm sorry.
[79:41.26]What the fuck?

[80:05.18]Don't make me kink-shame you.
[80:06.60]Come on.
[80:07.70]You don't have to do that.
[80:12.83]Damn it.
[80:14.59]See, I feel like I'm reloading the gun.
[80:15.81]Stop doing that.
[80:18.71]Compose yourself.
[80:20.19]Figure it out.
[80:20.71]Okay?
[80:23.28]Oh, God.

[82:38.51]Hopefully nothing bad happens.
[82:43.58]Okay, here we go.
[82:43.92]This guy's kind of creepy.
[82:44.82]I don't know if I trust him.
[82:48.68]Eh, whatever.
[82:49.12]Give me the ISR, Ron.
[82:50.04]I don't give a shit.
[82:50.58]He broke it.
[83:12.19]Terminally increases maximum health.
[83:14.67]Ah!
[83:14.79]I feel like I'm always out of ammo.
[83:25.78]Alright, what do you guys think?
[83:27.22]Health, armor, or ammo?
[83:29.20]Go ahead and let me know.
[83:31.40]Health, armor, or ammo?
[83:32.74]Whatever one gets the most amount of votes is the one that I'm going to pick.
[83:37.00]Let's see it.
[83:43.69]Now here's your chance.
[83:45.27]To choose.
[83:46.29]Choose your own adventure stream.
[83:48.29]It was ammo the whole time.
[83:49.25]Just kidding.
[83:54.22]And everybody is saying ammo.
[84:01.68]Faith.
[84:02.92]Luck.
[84:03.96]Charisma.
[84:06.15]Who the fuck is this guy?
[84:07.59]Go back to portal, dickhead.
[84:11.85]Get me out of here.
[84:15.14]Why is there a map of Japan over here?
[84:29.53]Now we wait.
[84:34.59]I'm just gonna sit here.
[84:35.81]I'll sit here and wait.
[84:36.63]I got time.
[84:38.71]I got time.
[84:51.50]I'm not paying any attention.
[84:53.62]The subtitles are going by so fast that I... It's hard for me to even care.
[85:01.18]Anybody else getting this?
[85:04.71]Willy Sploosh.
[85:06.61]Willy Splosh.
[85:18.56]Thank you, my friend, for your subscription.
[85:24.36]You decided to give that $5, and it's going to go to me.
[85:29.97]Uh-oh.
[85:31.55]Alert.
[85:33.55]Alert.
[85:33.95]Can you believe it?
[85:35.55]Where's the alarm?
[85:37.85]Something really intense is happening right now.
[85:43.38]That was supposed to be really dramatic, but it wasn't at all.
[85:50.85]This is supposed to- look it, look it off- look, everything's red.
[85:53.05]There's alarms everywhere, except I'm not seeing or hearing them.
[86:00.05]This is a rush moment, guys.
[86:08.08]Just another day at the office.
[86:10.22]No big deal.
[86:11.98]Just big bright lights everywhere.
[86:19.65]Uh, did I just win?
[86:24.51]Okay.
[86:27.85]That was very anti-climactic.
[86:33.24]Don't you guys feel like it was supposed to be like a, Get out!
[86:35.30]Get the fuck out of here!
[86:36.50]Like, run!
[86:41.06]No.
[86:42.26]Just a shitty kid's birthday party.
[86:45.90]Press space.
[86:46.48]They gotta just let me in the game.
[86:48.21]Don't, I'm just, I take my hands off the keyboard and mouse and I'm just sitting there moving my hands around talking.
[87:03.60]Stop the meltdown.
[87:04.94]Incoming voice comm.
[87:06.08]I wonder if we'll hear it.
[87:06.86]Mm-hmm.
[87:07.14]Right.
[87:07.28]Mm-hmm.
[87:32.91]Didn't I get something here?
[87:36.77]Yeah, I do.
[87:38.05]Area scanning technology.
[87:39.04]These upgrades improve the capabilities of navigation systems.
[87:43.46]Let's take a look.
[87:49.18]I don't really care about spider sense or item awareness.
[87:52.52]I don't care about secrets.
[87:57.72]Oh my god.
[87:58.48]I'm going to get so fucking lost here.
[88:08.44]Nice one.
[88:09.70]What an idiot.
[88:11.06]What a fucking idiot.
[88:16.62]It could have been me.
[88:18.20]It could have been me.
[88:22.36]This is crazy.
[88:23.10]Oh!
[88:25.26]Gold!
[88:27.86]It didn't kill me.
[88:28.60]I'm still alive.
[88:35.60]You guys knew that was gonna happen.
[88:36.60]Come on.
[88:52.21]Don't do death counts a death count for space See if he does it again Do it again Another weapon facility
[89:21.57]Calm down.
[89:24.91]God, you guys are so loud and annoying.
[89:26.65]I kind of like that tactical scope.
[89:37.20]Okay, please shut the fuck up.
[89:43.17]Ah, I like that a lot.
[89:44.05]I like that a lot.
[89:50.44]My right ear is enjoying this.
[89:51.82]Yeah, I know, really.
[89:58.72]This game just got so much easier.
[90:11.63]Just playing the chump way to play.
[90:23.87]I win.
[90:29.50]Gas leak detected.
[90:31.18]Whoa!
[90:37.34]That guy looks like a different enemy and he looks scary.
[90:45.82]Access denied.
[90:48.26]What?
[90:52.80]Was there a dead body?
[90:54.00]Can I pick some guy up and put him over here?
[91:00.20]Turn off the gas!
[91:00.86]Fuck, I'm on fire.
[91:10.40]Um... Sly161, not sure what to do here.
[91:14.85]I feel like I have to jump this.
[91:16.51]Thanks for two months though, man.
[91:17.39]Welcome back.
[91:18.85]Welcome back.
[91:19.49]Can I make this jump?
[91:21.66]Alright, it's either do or die.
[91:22.87]Now or never.
[91:25.01]Didn't make it.
[91:30.35]Why am I at this fucking foundry?
[91:31.93]I have no idea.
[91:32.63]Secret.
[91:34.11]Secret.
[91:40.20]I don't know what that is.
[91:41.04]It's not a secret.
[91:53.24]Predator token.
[91:55.30]I will hold on to that one for sure.
[91:56.62]Where the hell am I going?
[91:59.50]I have no idea.
[92:02.54]I'm going to get steamed.
[92:03.70]I made it down to the engine room.
[92:19.70]I gotta go this way.
[92:22.03]So up top and then down around.
[92:25.11]Shit, I was already up there.
[92:26.53]I gotta get back up.
[92:36.45]Get up there, you stupid ass.
[92:42.81]How do I make my way back around?
[92:44.05]Am I just stuck down here forever?
[92:45.29]No.
[92:59.67]Why am I playing Dying Light right now?
[93:02.92]I wanted to play Doom, not Dying Light.
[93:04.88]Fucking Bethesda.
[93:14.08]And you know what, Bethesda?
[93:15.74]Game sucks.
[93:16.98]How does that feel?
[93:22.43]Oh, I made it across.
[93:28.95]Get his arm.
[93:29.71]Yep.
[93:29.91]And I'm going to put it on the thing on the other side.
[93:40.84]Serious?
[93:46.50]Let's go open the door.
[93:51.36]He's right here.
[93:51.76]Access granted.
[93:57.06]You're making struggling sounds in real life like you were actually climbing.
[93:59.79]Yeah, I was.
[94:02.65]Another one of these giant alien birds.
[94:20.89]I'm the Benjamin Button gamer.
[94:22.51]The more I play, the worse I get.
[94:23.93]It actually has some truth to it.
[94:26.21]It really does.
[94:31.18]Do I like the game so far?
[94:33.34]Yes!
[94:36.00]Although... Although... So far, it seems to be... A little generic, if I would say.
[94:49.72]Kind of just moving from room to room, killing enemies and opening doors.
[94:52.66]It's like an arena shooter almost.
[94:58.24]But I am holding back judgment until I get a little bit further.
[95:01.57]You know, I'll give you more assessment on the whole thing.
[95:07.85]I think you could play better with a facecam just saying, no, I wouldn't.
[95:10.29]Because then I know the people are looking at me.
[95:25.77]Trust me.
[95:26.53]You don't.
[95:27.29]Demonic threat reduced by 25%.
[95:31.65]You play better with glasses, too.
[95:32.93]You know, I actually would play better with glasses.
[95:35.21]You're right.
[95:41.84]What?
[95:43.14]Wait.
[95:43.82]What?
[95:44.06]There's four corn nests I have to destroy.
[95:47.08]Okay.
[95:52.34]Can't get in there.
[95:56.88]I don't think you know what you're talking about.
[96:02.19]Oh, come on.
[96:02.49]I'm a shy gamer.
[96:03.81]I'm a shy gamer.
[96:13.02]I don't really want to have to kill all these.
[96:15.78]This is going to be a pain in the ass.
[96:20.78]Let me just take a look.
[96:23.38]Where am I going?
[96:23.86]Stop going that way.
[96:24.70]What are you doing?
[96:25.88]No!
[96:27.14]Bring me back the map!
[96:31.28]Why did I go that far away?
[96:39.40]So I gotta go down here.
[96:43.17]At least give us something worthwhile to watch?
[96:45.49]Oh my god!
[96:46.49]I just got burnt!
[96:50.57]You just burnt me with the end of a cigarette.
[96:54.18]Right on my nipple.
[96:59.62]Renee's angling for a nude.
[97:01.46]Alright, so if I go straight... Alright, you guys, you gotta remember this.
[97:08.88]Straight, right, left, straight.
[97:11.47]Straight, right, straight.
[97:13.81]Straight, right, straight.
[97:15.21]No, fuck, hold on.
[97:16.49]Straight, right, left, straight.
[97:21.27]Yeah.
[97:23.21]Straight, right...
[97:26.36]I already forgot it.
[97:29.99]No, back it up.
[97:31.41]This way.
[97:33.41]Straight right.
[97:35.09]Left.
[97:36.11]Straight.
[97:39.27]Got it.
[97:42.81]Naked.
[97:43.17]Okay, straight right.
[97:53.41]Okay, straight, straight right.
[97:56.75]Straight right, right left.
[97:58.29]Straight, straight.
[98:00.02]Got it.
[98:06.64]Hold on, what was it again?
[98:08.40]Straight.
[98:13.19]It's over here.
[98:31.16]Ah, that's a grenade now.
[98:36.65]Speaking of grenades, just, I don't care.
[98:43.25]Put the shield down.
[98:48.55]Come on, put that cookie down.
[98:50.51]Now.
[98:50.73]Alright, no more fucking around.
[98:52.73]I don't want to lose here.
[98:58.06]Dammit, did I miss that many times?
[98:59.30]Am I really that much of a shitty?
[99:01.98]I really could be.
[99:05.70]Turn left at the tertiary power coil, then up the high output plaza- Ronnie, I can't even read that.
[99:10.88]Ronnie, I can't read.
[99:11.60]Okay, we're just going.
[99:20.07]I'm in the middle of a cutscene here, please!
[99:41.38]If you drive by the Dunkin' Donuts, you've gone too far.
[99:45.58]100%.
[99:45.92]100% is shitty.
[99:49.86]Cutscenes won't save you.
[99:50.88]That's bullshit.
[99:53.00]Oh, man.
[99:53.38]Why do I have 4 HP?
[99:55.67]Why did I start with that low health?
[100:00.25]Do more executes.
[100:01.03]Yeah, I probably should be doing that.
[100:02.97]You're right.
[100:19.92]Stop trying to reload.
[100:21.42]You dingus.
[100:31.18]He doesn't know where to go.
[100:34.77]He doesn't know where to go.
[100:42.85]Ooh, we blew him up.
[100:43.95]I did okay.
[100:45.19]I did okay, Mom.
[100:47.77]Fuck, these guys hurt.
[100:49.07]A lot.
[100:51.06]I don't remember seeing this guy at all, by the way.
[100:57.83]Why did they put me here?
[100:58.63]Go, go, go, go, go!
[101:18.70]Don't forget the chainsaw.
[101:19.64]You're right.
[101:20.02]I forgot the chainsaw.
[101:23.38]Don't forget the chainsaw.
[101:28.69]I don't even... I killed him.
[101:31.41]Got him.
[101:36.91]Demon glue man for revenge.
[101:42.79]I did it.
[101:43.61]I did it.
[101:44.63]I did it.
[101:45.29]I'm so good.
[101:45.99]Not really.
[101:48.03]I could put a point into something.
[101:58.22]Whoa.
[101:59.50]Whoa.
[102:01.62]Don't.
[102:05.09]Did he just gain a thousand percent speed?
[102:08.07]You fuck.
[102:09.85]Ugh.
[102:20.56]Chase her!
[102:21.90]Chase her!
[102:30.86]This way, go this way again.
[102:32.08]This way again.
[102:33.12]Bunny hop, bunny hop, bunny hop.
[102:34.15]Go, go, go, go, go.
[102:37.85]I have so much to live for!
[102:38.93]Where's the health?
[102:45.77]Thank you so much.
[103:02.17]That guy didn't... What a wuss that guy just was.
[103:04.53]Okay, do I have a second?
[103:12.76]Dead or dead in two months.
[103:17.40]Thank you so fucking much.
[103:21.74]What do they say in the F word for you, man?
[103:24.65]I'm saying the F word for you.
[103:26.53]You know I saved the F word for you.
[103:36.20]Jerry is a talented gunman.
[103:38.48]Go back?
[103:38.92]Why do I need to go back?
[103:39.64]What did I miss?
[103:47.42]Please stop saying the fuck word.
[104:01.93]You know, I want to get this guy with the grenade.
[104:03.49]Watch this one.
[104:06.19]Good thing I'm recording.
[104:07.23]Good thing I'm recording, guys.
[104:08.55]Because this one's going to be one of the fucking books.
[104:15.75]See that one?
[104:16.13]I'm going to get the chainsaw.
[104:23.06]Yeah.
[104:23.32]Yeah.
[104:23.48]Where's...
[104:32.74]Secret level?
[104:33.40]I missed a secret level?
[104:43.85]Whoa, for the books.
[104:44.83]Get out of here.
[104:56.53]You lobster.
[105:00.19]Okay, let me just look at something quickly.
[105:05.92]Bullets fired while zoomed in penetrate targets.
[105:08.36]Thank you very much.
[105:11.04]I'd love for you to give me that.
[105:16.10]I'm not highlighting that.
[105:16.93]I'm only showing the parts where you suck.
[105:19.55]Eh.
[105:20.97]It's pretty typical, right?
[105:23.59]Pretty typical.
[105:26.71]These things penetrate now.
[105:27.69]Alright, I'm getting my grand WWF entrance.
[105:32.71]The fireworks are already going.
[105:35.78]I can't... I can't fit through this, and I'm getting hurt.
[105:42.70]Where to?
[105:44.77]Down here.
[105:46.17]Okay, let's get this out of the way here.
[105:48.77]Straight.
[105:49.73]Straight left.
[105:51.01]Straight.
[105:51.87]Straight left right.
[105:52.85]Straight.
[105:53.27]Got it.
[105:57.93]Okay.
[106:06.27]Ooh, I pushed that guy against the wall.
[106:18.91]Not today.
[106:20.69]Not today.
[106:25.15]What do we say to the god of death?
[106:27.77]Not today.
[106:29.09]No!
[106:30.77]No!
[106:41.63]Stop doing that.
[106:50.18]God damn it.
[106:51.50]Oh my god, I'm going to pee my pants.
[106:59.04]No, I was gonna execute him!
[107:02.45]You loiny bastard!
[107:14.39]Back to full health.
[107:19.19]Okay.
[107:24.10]Two more of those.
[107:29.90]Stupid search and destroy mission.
[107:31.30]I'm not really into it, I'm telling you.
[107:32.84]This next one is down... One of them's in the middle of nowhere.
[107:39.15]Where is that?
[107:39.67]It's at the very bottom.
[107:46.06]I'm just going to follow the marker that's up here already.
[107:51.40]Blue keycard.
[108:02.59]Apparently there was a lever earlier in that area that unlocked a secret from what I've heard.
[108:06.17]It's classic Doom level.
[108:09.80]Eh.
[108:10.66]Eh.
[108:12.50]Eh.
[108:13.84]Whatever.
[108:18.62]He's fucking serious.
[108:20.23]The only reason why I did that was to get the money suit and I just didn't.
[108:22.85]I completely missed it because I slid off.
[108:26.73]God damn.
[108:27.81]What a dumbass.
[108:28.47]Straight right.
[108:29.37]Straight left.
[108:48.43]That's creepy.
[108:50.56]Where's the other one?
[108:53.68]One more, right?
[108:56.56]Get off this godforsaken planet.
[109:05.80]So, Etalyx of the multiplayer is not that good.
[109:08.58]But, I got... Get the fuck out of my way.
[109:12.00]Stop swearing.
[109:12.64]I got a...
[109:15.83]Condense my squares.
[109:18.99]Huge guy.
[109:22.80]I missed that one completely.
[109:24.86]Stuck in the railing.
[109:28.62]I'm... not happy about this.
[109:35.27]Sorry, he's dead.
[109:39.75]Demonic threat reduced by 75%.
[109:43.36]Where's the last one?
[109:44.20]It's the one that's down at the bottom.
[109:45.86]How do I get down there?
[109:50.87]It's in the bottom of the pit.
[109:53.97]Straight right down.
[109:56.19]Right straight left up.
[109:57.57]Straight down straight.
[109:58.93]Straight left left right straight down down.
[110:01.83]Got it.
[110:07.79]Pushing back a key demographic of Catholic nuns with these swears.
[110:14.33]Yeah, I guess I am.
[110:15.95]I guess I am.
[110:16.75]I don't really know where to go here.
[110:30.96]Hold on.
[110:35.40]It's a blue door here, and that leads me... Maybe I can go down again?
[110:38.78]I guess?
[110:39.64]I don't know.
[110:46.65]This is not the way I want to go.
[110:47.55]No, I want to go back down.
[110:58.78]Tone down the swears.
[110:59.68]I can't help it.
[111:01.04]I get really into it.
[111:02.04]I need to stop losing my mind.
[111:15.19]Yeah, that's the way I want to go.
[111:16.55]This is the way I want to go.
[111:17.23]Is it down there?
[111:31.00]To the left, around, and then down?
[111:35.91]Is there one just like straight down here?
[111:44.63]Yeah, it's right there.
[111:46.49]There it is.
[111:47.51]Found it.
[111:56.05]That wasn't so hard.
[111:56.71]I'll say that now, but how do I get over there?
[112:01.95]No, actually.
[112:02.53]Actually really help.
[112:04.32]Somebody help me.
[112:04.78]I missed again.
[112:10.46]Just do it!
[112:27.10]Not gonna lie I am running in circles right now.
[112:33.31]Fuck.
[112:35.31]The money and the gas.
[112:36.31]Alright we're going gas.
[112:40.46]Right through his body.
[112:41.78]See you later.
[112:43.77]See you later.
[112:49.75]Emperor Palpatine.
[112:52.58]Thou witness the full power of the dark side.
[112:58.80]Anakin.
[112:59.64]Anakin, I'm too weak.
[113:01.21]I'm too weak.
[113:10.87]Everything is fine.
[113:11.61]This isn't a shit show.
[113:14.86]Yeah, it kind of is a shit show.
[113:17.68]Not that you mention it.
[113:18.50]I think I'm safe.
[113:25.06]Did I actually complete this area?
[113:26.90]Good.
[113:28.18]I wanted to execute him for the health.
[113:42.20]And I can actually destroy him.
[113:47.15]Actually, a Palpatine sub sound might be kind of funny.
[113:51.91]I could have Paul Bearer and Palpatine both say destroy him at the same time.
[113:57.65]Where am I off to?
[114:01.97]That way?
[114:03.51]That way, I think?
[114:04.75]Wait, what?
[114:06.25]Wait, what?
[114:11.10]I see you over there.
[114:13.57]Ooh, sorry.
[114:22.00]Sorry.
[114:22.88]What are you kids doing in here?
[114:30.20]Getting into trouble.
[114:32.40]It's fun getting into trouble.
[114:39.09]This is new.
[114:43.17]I think I actually, yeah, I have points to spend.
[114:49.43]Weapon self-damage.
[114:54.21]Don't care.
[114:57.27]Here we go.
[114:59.87]Recharge duration of grenades, I'm assuming, right?
[115:06.90]Why am I doing like a kissy sound?
[115:09.30]Oh, quick charge.
[115:10.02]Oh, cool.
[115:13.47]I don't really like that either, though.
[115:14.55]I don't like any of these.
[115:19.03]I really don't like any of them.
[115:28.20]What the fuck?
[115:32.40]I want Jerma the... I want Jerma the smooch me.
[115:39.57]Not PG-13.
[115:40.39]This is R-rated stream.
[115:43.89]You know?
[115:48.11]I feel like someone's going to yell at me if I don't get this.
[115:50.97]So now you can't yell at me anymore.
[115:52.27]Even though I don't really know what it does, nor do I care.
[115:56.05]I have to go that way.
[116:05.04]So we got to go up here.
[116:08.88]What's the correct way to go?
[116:12.46]This way.
[116:13.32]I just gotta keep following this and go up and around and up and around and around.
[116:20.01]Jeremy, my mom said I'm not allowed to watch R-rated streams.
[116:30.21]Easy enough.
[116:32.42]Jeremy kisses her band on Twitch.
[116:34.16]No, they're not.
[116:38.89]They are not.
[116:39.69]Don't say those things.
[116:41.47]Don't say that.
[116:47.05]Straight.
[116:48.26]And then right.
[116:56.16]Anything in here?
[116:56.66]Not really.
[116:59.74]Oh, there we go.
[117:01.32]Found something.
[117:01.80]I'm a bad influence?
[117:05.43]I'm not a bad influence, am I?
[117:10.26]Hopefully I'm a good influence.
[117:13.56]Somebody is talking and I can't hear them.
[117:18.51]Up and around.
[117:31.57]shirtless Jerma kiss cam now that would get me banned shirtless Jerma kiss cam absolutely I would get I would not be allowed to stream on Twitch ever again I can be certain of that totally certain of that although somebody would probably laugh for a few seconds I probably would laugh too
[117:57.76]Thanks a lot, Arpel.
[118:08.77]Arpel underscore.
[118:11.39]You are a hero.
[118:15.61]Much appreciated, dude.
[118:16.99]Thank you so much.
[118:20.16]What the... Really doing this right now?
[118:31.43]Worth.
[118:33.33]Would it be, though?
[118:34.79]Would it be worth?
[118:35.31]I kind of don't want to even fight the door.
[118:43.56]The door's going to be locked, isn't it?
[118:46.64]Oh, alert!
[118:47.08]You have to kill all the enemies in the area.
[118:48.86]Welcome to Doom.
[118:55.36]Damn.
[118:56.34]Calm down.
[119:04.17]I just skipped a rocket that guy and it got him.
[119:11.00]That was great.
[119:15.62]Come on, not a big guy.
[119:16.72]Stop spawning the big guys right next to me.
[119:27.48]See ya.
[119:30.38]I wouldn't really want to be ya.
[119:35.44]Don't burn me.
[119:36.72]It's not burning me, okay.
[119:40.52]Arcaneer, thanks for two months.
[119:46.15]Much love, thank you.
[119:48.65]Another one.

[119:54.57]Really?
[119:57.91]That's... Okay.
[119:58.95]Well, hey.
[119:59.33]What's up, man?
[120:00.05]Thanks.
[120:01.29]Welcome back.
[120:02.43]I did not even know you were subscribed for one month.
[120:04.68]That's how much of a moron I am.
[120:15.30]And a lot of you guys apparently subscribed at... What time is it right now?
[120:21.31]9.17 p.m.
[120:26.50]A month ago.
[120:27.12]Two months ago.
[120:27.62]Is this one chump-ass enemy gonna kill me?
[120:35.98]Better not.
[120:42.79]He hasn't actually died in quite a while?
[120:44.11]Yeah, I learned how to play.
[120:46.73]See, I can play video games sometimes.
[120:49.63]Even though this is on, like, just normal... ...you're a shitty difficulty, like people would say, right?
[120:58.34]Woo!
[121:00.76]One hit and I get... Alright, now... See, I got cocky.
[121:04.06]You guys really boosted my confidence too much that I started to play bad.
[121:21.75]Don't get cocky.
[121:22.91]Don't get cocky.
[121:23.63]Get even.
[121:25.68]What's that quote?
[121:26.30]Don't get... Don't get angry, get even, right?
[121:29.08]Don't get... Yeah.
[121:30.56]You know how it goes.
[121:31.10]There's two of these guys.
[121:38.36]Shit.
[121:39.79]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[121:43.77]Give me that health.
[121:44.93]You fucking... See, we started talking about it and I got my ass kicked.
[121:58.72]That happens.
[122:00.56]Performance anxiety.
[122:01.48]Now I have to do that again.
[122:14.41]Filthy casual.
[122:15.29]Yeah, I just got hunted.
[122:19.05]Somebody just left for deaded me.
[122:20.23]Am I playing versus right now?
[122:25.05]God damn.
[122:25.79]Okay, hold on.
[122:26.65]I can actually do something here.
[122:29.45]Can't I?
[122:30.57]Yeah.
[122:36.27]Jerma hasn't died in quite a while.
[122:40.93]Don't say that.
[122:41.97]Stop saying that.
[122:42.95]Bad things happen when you say that.
[122:48.15]Ooh, give me that.
[122:51.56]Skullcracker.
[122:53.00]Yes, I will.
[122:58.91]So what triggered that event there?
[123:00.93]I'm not entirely sure.
[123:08.15]Don't really know.
[123:08.77]Oh, it's up here.
[123:12.35]Okay.
[123:16.17]Let's do it again.
[123:16.75]This time, don't lose.
[123:18.83]I'm going to sit in the corner.
[123:21.95]This is the real strategy, guys.
[123:31.98]Just play like a total asshole and you'll be fine.
[123:42.16]Not a good idea.
[123:45.53]Yeah, no, I'm not doing that anymore.
[123:46.69]That's a terrible idea.
[123:53.13]Strats.
[123:58.26]I gotta conserve ammo, too.
[124:01.36]There's no reason for me to spam like that, but I am.
[124:07.71]They made a fast doom.
[124:08.95]I'm going to sit in a corner.
[124:18.95]I know, it's so true.
[124:20.63]It really is true.
[124:25.75]I got to just get these guys, burn these guys down.
[124:28.95]Check this.
[124:29.41]Ready?
[124:31.39]Check this.
[124:33.01]You're gonna be proud.
[124:34.55]You're gonna be real proud of me.
[124:45.36]I didn't think he was gonna take the long way down, guys.
[124:49.14]Sorry that he took the safe way.
[124:50.68]He's a gigantic monster.
[124:58.56]He very carefully came down to get me.
[125:10.61]Ayayay.
[125:15.25]He's not- What?
[125:16.90]Fucking Schmeagle.
[125:19.10]Get out of here, Schmeagle.
[125:42.88]Ooh, there's guy number one.
[125:47.20]Here are the two of them.
[125:49.12]Gotta be tactical.
[125:51.36]Give me the money suit.
[125:52.92]Boink.

[125:58.31]Damn it.

[126:20.45]Come on, die.
[126:21.91]Where'd he go?
[126:34.88]Fucking idiot.

[126:40.18]Good job, Darren.
[126:48.07]I turned into a high school cheerleader.
[126:49.55]What?
[126:49.85]What did I do?
[126:52.33]You're not gonna do it.
[126:53.41]I think that's the exit, right?
[126:54.25]Okie doke.
[126:54.67]How would I rate this game so far?
[126:56.61]Zero out of ten.

[127:59.28]Welcome back.
[128:01.74]You wonderful, wonderful person you are.
[128:10.37]Oh, it's the lady.
[128:10.99]The lady that doesn't have words.
[128:12.37]It's the first time I've heard this lady talk, by the way.
[128:23.30]What's she doing?
[128:35.71]Uh-oh.
[128:40.73]Guys, there's a portal that's going to be open.
[128:42.75]They're ripping up a portal.
[128:46.37]Watch out for the portal.
[128:49.87]I'm going to get sent to another dimension.
[128:55.01]Tell her I hate her.
[128:55.77]Nathan hates you.
[129:01.80]She wasn't a fan of that, Nathan.
[129:03.62]She just took off.
[129:07.81]She's performing Reiki on you?
[129:09.51]That was awesome.
[129:20.80]She's performing Reiki on you.
[129:26.17]Wait, what?
[129:36.35]Why do I think that's so funny?
[129:41.33]Shrivel.
[129:41.85]Thanks for the healing touch.
[130:00.07]Just the way she was moving her hands too.
[130:02.45]That's what it could have been.
[130:04.17]You guys are going to give me a headache today.
[130:08.29]I'm going to end up with a migraine.
[130:16.18]I don't get it.
[130:17.14]If you don't know what Reiki is...
[130:21.48]It's the thing where you like don't touch somebody and you heal them.
[130:25.64]It's like a healing like pretend like touch thing or something.
[130:32.17]It was a good joke.
[130:33.21]It was a high quality A plus joke.
[130:40.44]I was a big fan of that one.
[130:50.87]Zero out of six secrets.
[130:52.22]We're not going for secrets.
[130:53.10]I'm going for gameplay.
[131:05.15]You're welcome, Munger.
[131:07.99]Necroman.
[131:10.23]It was very, very funny.
[131:13.78]Fucking space bar.
[131:15.18]God damn it.
[131:19.35]I have to turn.
[131:19.99]I'm like, guys, hold on a second.
[131:22.43]Let me explain this for a second.
[131:25.79]I'm reading chat, right?
[131:28.09]In between levels.
[131:28.99]Hold on, this fucking idiot won't shut up.
[131:31.17]Give me a second.
[131:37.49]Alright, so in between levels, I'm reading chat.
[131:41.55]I look over at chat, and I start to read what people are saying.
[131:46.03]I'm not focused on pressing the space bar.
[131:47.37]I'm looking at what I want to interact with you guys.
[131:48.83]You know what I'm saying?
[131:51.27]Let's press space bar.
[131:53.27]Just load me into the game.
[131:56.28]I don't need you to confirm with me.
[131:58.10]Untethered cross-dimensional activity is a frequent occurrence outside of the base.
[132:02.46]So it is recommended that workers buddy up when journeying onto the Martian surface.
[132:08.78]Okay.
[132:13.22]Okay.
[132:14.44]Okay.
[132:15.32]What do I do?
[132:17.40]Just mash space while you reach out?
[132:18.96]Yeah, that's a pretty good idea.
[132:24.62]He's saying it's our fault.
[132:25.42]We should put ourselves in the corner.
[132:26.72]No, that's not what I said.
[132:35.21]Gothholic.
[132:35.89]Two months.
[132:37.19]Welcome back, Goth.
[132:42.61]Thank you so much.
[132:45.97]Now that is cool looking.
[132:51.71]This is really cool looking.
[132:55.58]This is Ghostbusters.
[132:59.76]Seriously, Zool is going to come down through there.
[133:03.46]Gozer.
[133:04.96]That is exactly what that is.
[133:07.38]Ghostbusters 3.
[133:08.99]Ghostbusters 3 confirmed.
[133:11.98]Actually, Ghostbusters already was confirmed when the trailer came out, and people were already talking about it.
[133:18.02]Where am I going?
[133:19.02]Down here.
[133:37.24]I feel like there's a purpose for this.
[133:38.74]Why would I have to come down here?
[133:41.05]Nothing here.
[133:41.65]Come on.
[133:42.63]Is it a generator?
[133:48.17]Blackhall Sun?
[133:49.11]Yeah.
[133:49.31]In that case, it wasn't Blackhall Sun.
[133:52.61]Give us a detailed description of what the plot is so far.
[133:54.95]I have no idea.
[133:56.85]Half of it I couldn't hear because the audio didn't work.
[134:00.45]And the other half, I wasn't paying attention.
[134:04.49]The only thing I know is that I'm shooting monsters with a gun.
[134:08.09]That's it.
[134:09.63]I don't know anything else.
[134:17.47]I really don't know where the hell I'm supposed to be going.
[134:19.99]I guess this way.
[134:25.20]Rune trial?
[134:26.56]Use the combat shotgun to eliminate 15 imps before the timer expires.
[134:33.08]Okay.
[134:33.68]Let's
[134:36.44]We're going to a different dimension.
[134:40.91]That's all you need to know, to be honest.
[134:45.27]Press space.
[134:45.99]I saw it.
[134:48.24]Okay, so I kill 15 imps in 10 seconds.
[134:51.24]Got it.
[134:51.48]3, 2, 1.
[134:51.62]Here we go.
[135:09.68]Come on.
[135:11.22]Come on, Jerry.
[135:12.84]Come on, Jerry.
[135:14.82]You can do it, Jerry.
[135:20.72]Come on.
[135:23.64]One more kill, Jerry.
[135:26.06]Did it.
[135:26.74]It was so easy.
[135:30.96]Okay.
[135:34.83]Okay.
[135:43.50]Jerry MLG.
[135:45.52]He's got an achievement for that.
[135:52.88]Press space to continue.
[135:54.50]God damn it.
[135:57.28]The runes tab is where you can view available runes and equip them.
[135:59.97]There's a lot of stuff in this game.
[136:01.57]You can also view your progress toward upgrading any runes you have acquired as well as requirements for unlocking additional rune slots.
[136:12.39]That's the only thing I have, so I might as well put it on.
[136:19.67]Uh, okay.
[136:26.70]I want to try the multiplayer.
[136:30.06]Maybe one more area and I'll go to the multiplayer.
[136:31.88]Because I really am curious as to what it's like.
[136:35.64]Ew.
[136:38.48]Why am I staying in this?
[136:41.21]Am I cursed for life now?
[136:45.62]New gun?
[136:47.28]New gun.
[136:51.54]Rocket launcher.
[136:53.72]Ooh.
[136:54.65]New toy.
[136:56.51]New toy.
[136:57.49]I don't want to use that right now.
[137:03.61]I'm going to save it.
[137:07.27]You do not want to play the mobile... I think it wants me to try the new weapon I got.
[137:13.38]Yep.
[137:24.64]I was curious if I could penetrate his shield.
[137:27.82]Turns out I can't.
[137:28.78]That was a nice shot, if I do say so myself.
[137:58.71]My spin move you did there, buddy, but it's not gonna save you.
[138:01.97]It's not gonna save you.
[138:04.81]It ain't gonna save you.
[138:05.91]I need more ammo.
[138:27.34]I upgraded this and I haven't even been using it at all.
[138:29.32]I feel kind of bad.
[138:34.56]What is the actual objective here?
[138:35.96]Straight?
[138:36.80]Shut down the three Argent filters.
[138:43.41]Can't say I'm too much of a fan of this second area.
[138:49.01]Second area in a row where I have to kind of do three spread out, destroy the objective things.
[138:55.68]Mmm, can't say I'm too happy about that commander steel.
[138:59.84]I'm gonna steal wool.
[139:01.03]Thank you for subscribing resubscribing for two months Much appreciated dude No spoilers Unless you think shooting these enemies is a spoiler
[139:26.12]Well, goodnight, Ryman.
[139:27.73]Thanks for coming out.
[139:36.93]Pay $3 to skip it.
[139:41.12]Why would I want to skip it?
[139:42.26]I spent $60 on this game.
[139:43.52]I don't want to skip anything.
[140:00.35]Give it to me.
[140:02.83]I immediately lost it too.
[140:04.16]Shit.
[140:04.98]Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
[140:09.06]Damn it.
[140:10.82]Not cool.
[140:16.32]Whoa!
[140:19.66]Ran out of real estate.
[140:21.56]Ran out of real estate.
[140:26.14]I didn't know.
[140:28.57]Uh...
[140:37.77]Nice one.
[140:39.69]I called it.
[140:40.27]Yeah, you did.
[140:47.97]You didn't win.
[140:48.69]Oh, I didn't win.
[140:51.97]It's free real estate.
[140:52.95]I got a free house for you, Jim.
[140:55.09]It's free real estate.
[140:56.11]These aren't my keys, Jim.
[140:58.91]These are your keys for your house.
[141:02.37]It's free real estate.
[141:16.65]Didn't know we were streaming Dark Souls.
[141:18.31]Yeah.
[141:19.95]Yeah.
[141:22.01]Yeah.
[141:27.25]Got to hit him in the head.
[141:30.15]I didn't hit him in the head once.
[141:34.51]But I'll take what I can get.
[141:35.56]I was going to do the same thing.
[141:44.86]I had the same idea.
[141:50.68]I've actually kind of gotten used to the mouse moving as annoying as it is.
[141:56.24]Coming up there.
[142:14.74]Get off my tower.
[142:19.78]Okay.
[142:22.17]I did it.
[142:26.88]Nine shots on the rocket launcher.
[142:28.24]That's a lot.
[142:30.28]That's a lot of shots.
[142:32.22]Yeah, you can turn the mouse moving off.
[142:34.04]I honestly have just been too lazy to do it.
[142:50.44]It would mean I'd have to like kind of turn the stream off.
[142:52.66]I'd have to restart the game and... The beginning of this stream went oh so well to begin with that I'm not going to make you guys suffer watching me.
[143:01.66]I like loading screens anymore even though, you know, could help a little but I don't really... don't really care that much to be honest.
[143:13.03]Where's the next one?
[143:18.61]Up there?
[143:21.75]Uh, out and around, I guess.
[143:29.65]Nothing else in here, right?
[143:37.06]Don't think so.
[143:37.50]I need to get up.
[143:45.44]Up above, on top of there, I think, to get over there.
[143:54.23]I dunno.
[144:00.27]I dunno.
[144:00.67]That way?
[144:06.09]I think it's that way.
[144:26.31]Shotgun is so reliable.
[144:27.45]I always feel like I have bullets for it.
[144:37.46]How's the game so far?
[144:38.20]It's pretty good.
[144:39.46]It's pretty good.
[144:42.56]I definitely want to... Everyone keeps telling me not to play multiplayer, but I want to play multiplayer for like a couple hours.
[144:47.64]Or maybe not.
[144:48.48]Maybe like an hour.
[144:50.02]I have no idea.
[144:50.62]And I have to pee too.
[144:52.32]I gotta go to the bathroom too.
[144:57.95]Is this the bad guy?
[144:58.77]I have not figured that out yet.
[145:04.09]I'm fairly certain this guy is not the good guy.
[145:06.19]All the way across.
[145:33.19]Loud pee incoming.
[145:35.35]No.
[145:35.79]No.
[145:40.29]I mute my microphone now, guys.
[145:43.12]You can't hear me pee.
[145:44.28]It's not gonna happen.
[145:52.48]Whatever.
[145:52.84]Screw those guys.
[145:53.42]I don't even care.
[145:58.53]This looks like a way I can go.
[146:02.23]Secret.
[146:04.22]Secret.
[146:04.96]Found a secret.
[146:11.45]It wasn't really a secret, but it was, you know... I want to jump from there.
[146:28.17]My gaming chair is a toilet.
[146:29.58]That would be very uncomfortable.
[146:35.33]I just want to hear loud pee and you saying in the distance, oh yeah, that's the stuff.
[146:39.75]That's so much to ask.
[146:42.71]I made a video where I did that.
[146:46.55]That's actually a video.
[146:48.21]You were describing a video I made.
[146:50.99]Punishment of the pee.
[146:51.89]A lot of people didn't... People were really weirded out by that video, by the way.
[146:58.73]What the fuck are you doing?
[147:06.19]Snapped his neck.
[147:11.79]Doom pacifist run?
[147:16.91]That would not be possible.
[147:18.07]I've really learned how to take the big guys on.
[147:33.52]Pretty easy at this point.
[147:34.52]You just have to shoot him in the head like 55,000 times.
[147:36.78]Is this the grenade?
[147:45.50]Ow.
[147:47.46]Ow, ow, ow.
[147:55.59]No, that was a rocket launcher.
[147:56.61]I don't want to shoot the rocket launcher at this guy.
[147:58.25]Easy.
[147:58.53]Easy.
[148:11.24]Don't jump off into the electrical waters down here.
[148:14.87]They look like they're electric.
[148:19.73]Stupid things up there.
[148:33.38]Don't hit me with that.
[148:34.64]One hit and I'm dead.
[148:36.54]Not anymore.
[148:36.94]Good.
[148:37.86]I got the vacuum.
[148:43.35]As a professional gamer, what's my current thoughts on Doom?
[148:52.53]There you go.
[149:04.56]It's alright.
[149:07.62]Fun to run around and shoot monsters.
[149:14.28]Are guys still alive or what?
[149:18.00]Who the hell is still alive?
[149:25.18]There's one idiot down here.
[149:32.06]The enemies could be more uniquely designed from one another.
[149:34.30]They're all kind of just gross dude.
[149:35.86]Yeah.
[149:44.24]Yeah, but it is fun to run around and shoot monsters.
[149:53.14]Really?
[149:53.46]Reminds me of Dead Space.
[150:00.61]Dead Space was a little, uh... A little more to it.
[150:03.95]A little more dangerous, I think.
[150:07.75]In regards to enemy... enemy placement.
[150:12.05]this reminds me of BioShock infinite you guys remember BioShock infinite BioShock infinite did the same kind of thing where you just kind of went from one place to the next the area needed to be cleared and then you left and went to the next spot they very much just kind of close you off and say kill all these guys
[150:37.95]And then go to the next spot.
[150:40.93]And here comes a bunch of fucking guys.
[150:43.85]Go to the next spot.
[150:45.87]Here comes a bunch of fucking guys.
[150:49.37]Go to the next spot.
[151:01.16]Where's our time bomb?
[151:02.14]I already broke this one.
[151:04.62]Shit.
[151:04.96]Where is it?
[151:09.80]Was I already?
[151:10.42]I was in the air.
[151:11.30]Fuck me.
[151:13.14]Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.
[151:16.78]Crap, crap, crap, crap.
[151:17.76]Went the wrong way.
[151:18.42]I was going the right way and I just turned around like an idiot.
[151:23.58]That's every shooter.
[151:25.84]Let me make it a little bit more.
[151:27.24]I'll try to clear up my thoughts there.
[151:31.17]When you go to certain areas in this game, it just locks you in.
[151:35.13]Like, you've noticed that, right?
[151:36.71]It's like, hey, you're locked in this room, you kill everything before you're allowed to leave.
[151:44.48]That's, uh, that's what I'm talking about.
[151:46.10]What the hell is... Okay.
[151:51.86]I will take that for sure.
[151:56.46]I gotta go down.
[151:57.10]And over here.
[152:07.30]Use the blood pressure machine.
[152:08.35]It's called an arena shooter.
[152:15.65]Yeah, it will.
[152:19.44]Where's my... Are there bosses in this game?
[152:34.51]Did I just ask for a boss and did one just appear in front of my face?
[152:42.89]Did that just happen?
[152:48.62]I feel like that's what just happened.
[152:57.22]Alright, well...
[153:10.18]Ah shit, area locked down.
[153:18.21]Help, help, help.
[153:29.02]I don't think that's a boss.
[153:33.52]No, I wanted to execute you.
[153:34.86]You don't have like full health again.
[153:49.32]Oh no, it's the flash.
[153:57.80]Hello?
[154:01.12]One more guy.
[154:03.38]He's going to walk into his own death.
[154:04.60]Come on.
[154:06.62]Go that way.
[154:08.80]Fall into the electricity.
[154:09.88]Go into the electricity.
[154:10.70]Go.
[154:16.03]Fine.
[154:16.55]Get out of here.
[154:21.98]Why are you hitting yourself?
[154:22.80]Why are you hitting yourself?
[154:24.95]There's not another guy.
[154:25.63]There's another guy.
[154:26.69]Come on.
[154:29.69]You have to kill every single little piss enemy in this game.
[154:40.24]Oh my god.
[154:43.58]Shoot him.
[154:55.60]I have six.
[154:58.54]That's a lot.
[154:59.06]I can upgrade something.
[155:00.16]I feel like this is the weapon of choice.
[155:06.71]Yeah, I'm going to do it and move faster.
[155:08.19]What's the mastery?
[155:10.05]Ammunition fired while zoomed uses experimental heavy damage rounds.
[155:15.38]Get 50 headshot kills while using the tactical scope.
[155:21.20]Looks like we're going to have to do that.
[155:22.96]Where's this guy's flash drive?
[155:23.76]Did I already take the flash drive out of this guy?
[155:25.82]I guess I did.
[155:53.38]So that way and then left.
[155:59.24]I do move a lot faster.
[156:00.74]That's cool.
[156:03.18]Wrong.
[156:05.79]Accidentally clicked my thumb button.
[156:07.99]If you were curious as to what just happened there.
[156:13.33]It's probably going to get me killed too.
[156:32.45]BossySuit with the subscription.
[156:34.35]Thanks a lot, BossySuit.
[156:36.93]Welcome.
[156:39.83]Enjoy your stay.
[156:43.82]You are now one of us.
[156:44.80]Just gonna get headshot kills.
[156:55.05]Little self-exploders.
[156:59.39]I want those headshot kills.
[157:11.89]Sweep the leg!
[157:13.22]Sweep the leg.
[157:28.40]Got him.
[157:30.97]Ow.
[157:31.19]Is there health over here?
[157:35.51]No.
[157:37.57]Shit, one of these Psycho Mantis ladies.
[157:45.74]Ooh.
[157:48.48]Ooh.
[157:49.06]Ooh.
[157:51.60]Ooh.
[157:55.05]Ah, I can't listen to him.
[158:01.86]Oh, shit.
[158:06.53]Get away from me.
[158:09.73]Wow, that was lucky.
[158:14.07]What am I going back out here for?
[158:26.12]I had a good thing going on in there.
[158:33.33]Why am I pulling this out right now?
[158:35.59]Why would I do this to myself?
[158:37.23]I can't believe I'm not dead.
[158:46.76]Thank goodness.
[158:47.62]That was very lucky.
[158:50.94]Berserk.
[158:58.95]Come on, I gotta get somebody.
[159:08.54]Gotta take the power cable out.
[159:09.78]You gotta take the Homer Simpson thing out.
[159:14.04]Give that back to Homer Simpson.
[159:39.28]Go on.
[159:40.20]Very interesting stuff.
[159:41.18]Very interesting.
[159:42.06]Okay.
[159:42.20]Uh, I gotta pee.
[159:43.00]So... I'll be back.
[159:44.70]Alright, I'll wait for a second, Quack.
[160:08.26]Quack of Dawn, welcome back.
[160:09.58]Two months.
[160:10.49]Thank you so much.
[160:12.07]Take it easy, Nathan, by the way.
[160:16.19]Quack, thanks a lot, man.
[160:17.23]Welcome back, dude.
[160:17.69]I'm going to be right back.
[160:19.61]So we go to this screen while I leave your mic on.
[160:22.96]No, I'm not going to leave my fucking...
[162:41.68]Sounds like you are peeing directly into the mic.
[162:47.56]This... What are you guys talking about?
[162:53.08]Every time.
[162:53.70]It's pee-pees.
[162:54.56]Every time he pees.
[162:55.60]He pees this, pees that.
[162:58.72]People pee, man.
[162:59.80]People have pee.
[163:01.68]What, you never peed before in your life?
[163:06.89]Alright, what do I get on?
[163:10.40]God, that reminds me.
[163:12.29]Grump clump.
[163:14.05]Six months.
[163:14.67]That's half a year.
[163:15.73]Thanks a lot, man.
[163:18.19]Welcome back.
[163:21.95]All I heard was piss for the last hour.
[163:23.68]No.
[163:24.42]No.
[163:27.48]One time.
[163:29.38]One time I fucking... I left my mic on and I went upstairs and I pissed.
[163:33.50]And everyone freaked out.
[163:36.03]Because they said they could hear it, but there's no way they could have.
[163:38.23]Now, every time I go to the bathroom, people say they can hear it, and it's not true.
[163:43.00]Do you think the pee was red?
[163:45.74]What?
[163:54.00]All I've heard was piss.
[164:02.42]We can hear it.
[164:03.54]I turned my mic on.
[164:05.14]No, don't encourage them.
[164:07.80]Do not encourage them, Renee.
[164:10.76]You're in space.
[164:11.60]I'm so sorry.
[164:16.26]I'm such a bad streamer.
[164:16.98]Why are you guys watching?
[164:35.55]Oh, geez.
[164:41.85]Danny?
[164:43.13]Danny K. Desho.
[164:46.05]Welcome back.
[164:49.05]Welcome back.
[164:50.37]New enemy.
[164:55.35]Okay, new enemy shoots rockets.
[165:00.75]New enemy scares me.
[165:09.74]Not this time.
[165:16.77]That guy's cool looking.
[165:21.95]Why are you watching viewer count drops by 10 instantly?
[165:26.99]Did that actually happen?
[165:28.47]That's kind of funny.
[165:37.63]I've only hit seven headshots only.
[165:39.67]Come on.
[165:46.67]Headshot kills.
[165:47.43]I want to get the mastery.
[165:56.69]I missed.
[166:06.24]Still alive.
[166:06.78]These guys take a lot of hits.
[166:09.06]I will say.
[166:09.70]You know, one of these days, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
[166:24.48]I'm gonna be like, oh, I'm going to the bathroom.
[166:26.06]No, I'm not.
[166:26.42]No, never mind.
[166:26.90]Hold on.
[166:27.70]Fuck that.
[166:30.58]I gotta hold on to that one.
[166:31.84]I gotta hold on to it.
[166:33.70]Not gonna say.
[166:36.55]We'll see.
[166:38.45]We'll see what happens.
[166:41.45]Keep that one locked away for a little bit.
[166:43.01]Error 83.
[166:43.87]Diablo 3, man.
[166:44.71]Remember Diablo 3?
[166:45.61]Never forget Diablo 3.
[166:47.16]Where am I going?
[166:47.76]Okay, so this must be a boss.
[166:48.76]Kill Olivia Pierce.
[167:10.06]If it's not a boss, then I don't know what it is.
[167:16.77]New legs?
[167:25.09]Double jump?
[167:25.66]Okay, that's awesome.
[167:27.64]Finally.
[167:28.70]Finally, give me something to care about.
[167:30.88]Okay.
[167:42.15]400 meters this way.
[167:43.47]Double jump!
[167:53.43]That was on purpose.
[167:55.52]I wanted to see if momentum stayed.
[167:57.56]Or if you could change directions quickly.
[168:01.68]You don't have to laugh at that.
[168:04.94]If I see a fucking one FailFish, I'm ending the stream.
[168:09.22]You understand?
[168:10.84]If I see one FailFish, I'm ending the stream.
[168:25.04]I wanted to see if you could go like this.
[168:26.96]But you can't.
[168:27.82]You know, jump, turn, and jump backwards?
[168:29.29]No, you can't.
[168:36.39]Alright, looks like I'm turning off the stream.
[168:40.57]Alright.
[168:45.69]I'll see you guys later.
[168:48.88]Got ya.
[168:49.34]Man, I fucking just got you guys.
[168:51.82]Got ya.
[168:52.18]I was gonna turn my facecam on and give everybody the finger, but it was too much work.
[169:14.70]Ah, he got me.
[169:18.96]Hey, what's this?
[169:19.78]Oh shit, can you jump down here?
[169:20.90]I can't even, how do I turn my webcam on?
[169:45.53]Nevermind, joke's over.
[169:49.87]Alright, no more fucking around.
[169:55.05]Where am I supposed to actually be going?
[170:01.59]Where am I supposed to go?
[170:03.99]Cross the bridge.
[170:06.63]Easier said than done.
[170:11.32]Sure you can't.
[170:12.06]A likely excuse.
[170:24.10]I didn't even know you could fall off that way.
[170:30.21]That was not intentional.
[170:31.51]I didn't even know you could go off that way.
[170:33.15]I was trying to jump around.
[170:35.77]No more fucking around.
[170:36.89]No more fucking around.
[170:38.59]I'm just trying to learn how to do double jumps.
[170:49.79]This is the easiest task I have been given in this whole fucking game.
[170:54.18]Just jump from platform to platform.
[170:57.32]You've done it before.
[170:58.46]You can do it.
[170:59.34]It's not that hard.
[171:00.10]Okay, I can't really go on with that.
[171:08.35]Murray's Bagels.
[171:09.31]Best bagels in town.
[171:10.77]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[171:12.37]Thanks for the resub.
[171:15.87]Three months?
[171:17.21]Three months.
[171:17.85]It was three months.
[171:19.61]So should I go that way?
[171:24.29]There we go.
[171:25.19]Why the fuck wasn't that working before?
[171:27.66]You saw me do that before.
[171:28.68]That was bullshit.
[171:34.14]I'm self-conscious of how I look every day.
[171:36.20]Not just today.
[171:39.84]Oh, my dog wants to come in.
[171:44.84]I'm very self-aware, guys, as I'm sure you probably know.
[171:50.25]Uh, let me let my dog in.
[171:51.31]One sec.
[171:56.85]Come on in, dog.
[172:00.91]Hey, dog.
[172:04.32]Show the dog.
[172:06.48]I'll show the dog in a minute.
[172:09.70]Alright, you wanna see the fucking dog?
[172:12.24]You guys wanna see the dog?
[172:26.51]Finger... What's his name?
[172:28.29]Fingerprints.
[172:29.67]Welcome, Fingerprints.
[172:30.53]Thanks for subbing.
[172:32.78]Welcome to the... Welcome to the group.
[172:51.83]Saw the dog.
[172:52.89]Wait, what?
[172:58.16]And somebody subscribed.
[173:01.18]Stilvan.
[173:05.06]Welcome, Stilvan.
[173:06.34]Welcome back.
[173:09.01]Tell him I said hi.
[173:09.77]Hey, Otto, Renee says hi.
[173:14.57]Yeah, you don't think you're... Otto has never been seen awake.
[173:16.79]That's true.
[173:17.75]You know, you are right about that one.
[173:19.29]When you're right, you're right.
[173:23.02]Okay.
[173:24.42]Let me go back to this.
[173:27.62]The cruelest thing you could do is cut the video.
[173:30.04]Well, we gotta go back to playing this game, man.
[173:32.36]It's more important things.
[173:36.81]I'm all turned around now.
[173:39.95]That way.
[173:41.63]This way.
[173:44.71]Just gonna give some fair warning here.
[173:46.39]Fair warning.
[173:46.95]There's gonna be a lot of double jumping.
[173:48.81]I'm probably gonna fall.
[173:50.77]So...
[173:52.57]Get your stream enders ready in the chat, guys.
[173:56.54]You guys ready?
[173:56.90]Get your stream enders ready.
[173:58.20]Do they have double jump too?
[174:10.87]See that double right there?
[174:15.55]Holy shit.
[174:27.59]Actually, it makes the game more fun.
[174:40.04]Really?
[174:41.50]Jump over here.
[174:42.79]Jump over here.
[174:44.13]Who is behind me?
[174:47.69]So badly.
[174:48.25]I want to hit him in midair.
[174:49.03]Come on.
[174:50.61]Jump.
[174:51.81]Just jump.
[174:52.43]Jump.
[174:53.90]Jump.
[174:58.72]You guys are no fun.
[175:00.02]I wanted you to jump.
[175:09.57]Whoa, what?
[175:10.67]Where?
[175:12.15]Where?
[175:14.35]Where?
[175:20.23]This is the one.
[175:21.99]After all that, this is gonna be the one where I fall.
[175:30.77]I made it.
[175:31.85]I did it.
[175:32.13]Hooray.
[175:35.39]I'm not embarrassed.
[175:36.39]Uh-oh, there he is.
[175:37.07]There's Olivia.
[175:38.61]Oh.
[175:41.09]That's one nasty... Get her.
[175:43.43]Kill her.
[176:03.93]I didn't even fall off.
[176:04.65]You guys can't do failed fish.
[176:05.59]What the hell?
[176:11.43]Ooh, shotgun.
[176:13.03]That's a real shotgun.
[176:14.43]It's an old school shotgun.
[176:16.02]I like it.
[176:26.15]Something sweet.
[176:27.83]Very sweet.
[176:28.51]Whatever.
[176:28.91]Didn't fall off.
[176:29.91]I know.
[176:30.95]I'm gonna sneeze, though.
[176:31.85]I gotta mute.
[176:32.57]Hold on.
[176:32.87]I'm gonna sneeze.
[176:33.99]Okay.
[176:54.95]Look at this thing.
[176:55.55]This thing's nice.
[176:56.33]Will you sneeze already?
[176:57.75]This is really messing me up.
[177:07.59]God, I would love to just sneeze right now.
[177:09.23]Please don't do this.
[177:20.80]A lot of people.
[177:25.40]Sneeze cam?
[177:27.16]Now that would be funny if I turned it on for that reason only.
[177:42.11]Die.
[177:42.57]I'm using a lot of these rockets.
[177:53.60]Come on, how many rockets does it take to kill one of these things?
[178:06.76]Hold on, Star is saying something.
[178:10.74]Yes, Doom has a story.
[178:11.58]The four-part book series.
[178:12.78]I was a young lore man.
[178:14.00]That dude just gave me a wall of text.
[178:15.16]I can't read that.
[178:15.68]I'm busy fighting a gigantic fucking triceratops lady.
[178:18.29]You're going to have to give me a minute.
[178:32.86]Too close, too close, too close.
[178:39.87]Jeez.
[178:45.05]Jeez!
[178:47.75]That was something.
[178:52.56]Almost halfway to the headshot goal.
[178:58.36]Almost.
[178:59.82]Almost there guys.
[179:02.28]We're getting close.
[179:03.56]Do I need to jump on this?
[179:22.13]I don't think so.
[179:23.52]Or do I?
[179:23.92]Do I have to climb up there?
[179:25.18]Let's see if I can get on top of it from here.
[179:31.87]Yep, I got it.
[179:55.08]I got it.
[179:56.84]I tried.
[179:57.32]Space.
[180:09.21]Hit space.
[180:10.63]Hit fucking space.
[180:15.67]Ah, stop fail fishing.
[180:16.75]Stop it.
[180:17.17]I don't like fail fishes.
[180:18.95]You're making me feel uncomfortable.
[180:22.05]Alright, so check.
[180:23.39]Don't need to go up there.
[180:26.63]Don't go up there.
[180:31.83]Oh, God.
[180:33.34]Look at how fucking huge this is.
[180:39.78]I'm not going to lie.
[180:41.48]This is making me want to give up right now.
[180:47.30]This is making me want to just go into multiplayer for like a little bit.
[180:51.04]They just scared me away with this huge map here.
[180:58.52]There's a secret up there?
[181:00.99]How am I supposed to get it?
[181:01.75]I'm trying this again.
[181:09.57]Didn't work.
[181:13.91]Hold on.
[181:16.44]Give up and play iPhone games?
[181:21.01]Okay, okay, hold on.
[181:25.23]Oh, fuck me!
[181:28.71]I'm done.
[181:29.75]We're gonna go.
[181:30.57]We're gonna play.
[181:30.99]I'm not doing that again.
[181:35.06]So I have to go.
[181:35.94]Ugh, what a pain in the ass.
[181:40.54]Wait a minute.
[181:44.06]Oh.
[181:46.04]Okay.
[181:47.16]Follow your nose.
[181:51.53]Alright, this is... scary.
[182:00.81]Okay.
[182:06.39]I will take your essence.
[182:13.82]Good job.
[182:20.27]Alright, boys.
[182:32.82]I think we're at the boys and girls.
[182:36.43]This is the last boss of the game.
[182:38.81]We made it to the end.
[182:50.03]Alright, wish me luck.
[182:50.61]I'm gonna need some luck here, guys.
[182:55.84]I'm gonna need some power.
[182:59.88]Uh-oh.
[183:01.19]It's gonna say his name.
[183:01.89]No, it's not.
[183:24.98]Give me your energy.
[183:26.86]Raise your beers.
[183:33.92]That's what I'm talking about.
[183:34.81]That's what I wanted all along.
[183:38.57]A boss fight.
[183:39.29]Are you serious?
[183:44.23]How are you still standing, dude?
[184:04.90]He's dead.
[184:05.24]That wasn't even a... No, there's just a bunch of them.
[184:31.14]It's a regular enemy, dude, in the first 15 minutes of the game.
[184:34.08]This isn't the first 15, man.
[184:37.86]I've been playing for like three hours.
[184:39.46]What are you on about?
[184:43.03]I so badly need to get you with an execute.
[184:49.67]I'll take it.
[184:52.59]I'll take it.
[185:02.06]3 HP!
[185:08.72]He's right here!
[185:13.61]Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[185:14.73]Full health.
[185:15.25]Wow.
[185:16.89]That.
[185:17.59]Was.
[185:19.37]Kinda crazy.
[185:21.25]Don't jump into the giant plasma beam.
[185:22.91]That would be a mistake.
[185:30.99]Wow, I annihilated that guy.
[185:51.55]Utilize your guns.
[185:52.39]What do you think I'm doing?
[185:54.29]What's this button do?
[186:03.48]This double barrel shotgun is amazing.
[186:07.24]I really like it.
[186:08.02]This is my regular shotgun.
[186:17.99]Oh, you rocket launcher.
[186:19.55]Where are you?
[186:20.45]Come on, give me an air shot.
[186:24.39]Double air shot, guys.
[186:26.79]You see that double air shot?
[186:27.72]Holy shit.
[186:29.54]I can't believe I just got that.
[186:31.84]Play of the game, for sure.
[186:39.41]Yeah.
[186:42.43]Okay.
[186:48.86]Oh, God.
[187:24.28]I'm in a good mood right now.
[187:26.01]You guys are making me in a really good mood.
[187:35.75]No triple?
[187:36.57]What?
[187:37.53]Come on.
[187:45.28]Oh, grab it!
[187:48.42]I didn't know that's what I was supposed to be doing there.
[187:53.04]Look at the chat.
[187:54.88]Reading the chat.
[187:56.72]Now I gotta go all the way back up.
[187:58.54]Shit, everyone's gonna failfish me.
[188:01.66]Wait, what?
[188:07.22]Mini... Mini Monk, three months.
[188:09.25]Three months.
[188:10.05]No, here come the failfishes.
[188:13.45]Stop it.
[188:14.35]Don't do that.
[188:14.99]I don't like it.
[188:15.85]I hate it.
[188:21.11]Can I not get...
[188:23.62]For the love of God.
[188:25.38]I'm about to just jump into the stupid Kool-Aid gun.
[188:38.87]Okay, here we go.
[188:39.73]One, two, three.
[188:42.43]Go for it.
[188:44.61]I made it this time, guys.
[188:45.61]I did it.
[188:45.91]How far up do I have to go?
[188:54.19]It's kind of making me sick.
[188:59.49]Oh, we gotta go.
[189:01.33]Whoa.
[189:02.31]I can't look at that.
[189:04.07]He did it.
[189:16.09]He did it.
[189:16.57]He actually made it up.
[189:19.45]Unbelievable.
[189:22.42]Can I make that?
[189:24.43]No.
[189:27.09]Yes.
[189:30.12]I'm so glad they have indicators with big green lights on them for morons like me.
[189:47.67]That scared me.
[189:50.53]I got scared.
[189:51.43]I got a little scared.
[189:54.85]I threw a grenade.
[190:03.55]And a frag.
[190:10.34]Okay, wait for a... What is going on?
[190:15.48]I'm gonna have to grab this and then move?
[190:22.17]Alright, I made it.
[190:32.69]I want more ammo for this thing.
[190:33.73]Where can I get more ammo?
[190:43.50]Those are a lot of headshots I'm doing on this guy.
[190:46.94]Seriously.
[190:58.64]I want that upgrade, please.
[191:00.66]Give it to me.
[191:02.52]I'd love to take it.
[191:06.12]Thank you, Ronnie.
[191:08.20]Thank you, Ronnie.
[191:11.50]Oh, chainsaw kills also get you killed.
[191:22.50]This is such spam.
[191:32.65]Where am I going?
[191:34.70]Actually, kind of helped.
[191:39.60]Invulnerability.
[191:41.30]Oh, yeah.
[191:52.22]Three hours in.
[191:52.82]Where do I get ammo?
[191:53.50]Well, I'm not invincible anymore.
[192:00.92]see okay on multiplayer I feel like this would be a ton of fun just jumping around diving around going into these cubes
[192:28.56]You get the feeling I don't understand the game?
[192:30.40]Tried to punch him and I threw a grenade.
[192:39.37]Ooh, back up.
[192:42.27]Didn't grab the ledge there.
[192:44.56]Are you fucking me right now?
[192:58.54]Took his arm clean off.
[193:00.19]Say goodbye to your arm.
[193:09.09]Whoops.
[193:20.14]I can't believe this guy is still alive somehow.
[193:27.96]That wasn't very clean.
[193:29.67]Nothing on this stream has been clean.
[193:32.11]Not even me.

[200:50.99]That's too far.
[201:00.80]Isn't that too far to jump to?
[201:02.02]I feel like I'm not going to make that jump.
[201:03.74]That's what I did last time, and I... Like, I tried to get it here, and it squished me.
[201:11.63]This is right there.
[201:12.33]I can get on it from here, alright?
[201:16.57]Okay, then... Go.
[201:18.51]Now, should I have stayed on top of that?

[202:11.40]Thank you for showing me that I can't go through that.
[202:13.20]I will instantly die.
[202:27.54]You are all wrong.
[202:33.72]He's gonna get squished.
[202:34.94]Told you.
[202:40.14]That was kind of unnecessary, but whatever.
[202:41.56]That was close.
[202:45.69]That was close.
[202:56.53]Can we finally be done with that shit, please?
[203:00.72]Every time he jumps in this game, I get a bad feeling in my leg.
[203:03.96]That doesn't sound healthy.
[203:10.81]Sorry I'm doing that to you.
[203:35.01]What the fuck?
[203:38.62]Checkpoint's right there.

[204:07.13]It's alright.
[204:15.09]This room is just a total clusterfucker.
[204:19.42]One of these idiots is in here in a closed off space.
[204:21.40]What the hell?
[204:34.86]I'm just going to run through the door.
[204:43.39]Yeah, rockets would be good right about now.
[204:51.37]I'm just running through.
[204:52.09]This area sucks.
[204:53.71]I'm just going this way.
[204:57.39]Fuck all of you.
[204:58.75]Charge me.
[204:59.25]Charge down the hallway.
[205:02.69]I don't want to fight you guys in this, like, little fucking teeny tiny corridor.
[205:08.86]Now I have to.
[205:09.52]No, I don't.
[205:11.50]Shit.
[205:14.56]Some of the people are exploding.
[205:16.54]People are exploding and shit.
[205:17.66]I don't even know what the hell's going on.
[205:24.61]Jesus.
[205:33.43]I'm dead.
[205:39.08]I just don't want to... I told you I was going to hate this level.
[205:42.70]It was the giant scale of the mountain.
[205:45.38]And then get stuck in a corridor with a hundred enemies.
[206:08.19]Get rid of your shield, please.
[206:18.98]Fuck.
[206:19.44]Did I really just hit myself?
[206:20.56]Is that what happened?
[206:23.56]Okay.
[206:26.19]Should have played on easy.
[206:35.66]I really need this.
[206:36.80]Give it to me.
[206:56.71]I will just take you out one by one.
[207:00.69]I'm not fucking around.
[207:07.50]Okay.
[207:08.98]Chill out.
[207:12.26]Take a look.
[207:14.10]Is that a book?
[207:20.46]Jump up there.
[207:22.32]Let me just see where the hell I am right now.
[207:26.22]There's even more to go.
[207:27.64]I have to go even further up this stupid thing?
[207:29.58]Aye aye aye.
[207:32.28]I think I didn't have to go out that window.
[207:39.34]Yeah, I do.
[207:39.74]If it's one of these runes, I'll do it.
[207:48.15]Armor the combat shotgun to eliminate 10 unwilling with explosive barrels.
[207:52.45]Damage before the timer.
[207:53.37]Okay, let's try it.
[207:55.50]Give it a go.
[208:04.77]I am the raddest girl, little honey.
[208:07.97]I will kill you just for... Just for him!

[208:19.73]We're all friends here.
[208:21.13]We're all buddies.
[208:21.69]Okay, we need... I can kill myself with this, so I need to be careful.
[208:28.98]Seriously?
[208:31.68]Seriously?
[208:39.82]Do you want me to kill him?
[208:43.98]Not going to happen.
[208:44.92]Not going to happen.
[208:47.63]What?
[208:48.21]He didn't die from that?
[208:48.91]Are you serious?
[208:49.51]I'm going to try it again.
[208:53.27]I didn't know that they don't respawn.
[209:03.20]So I need to be very careful with it.
[209:15.25]I can't believe it.
[209:15.87]How is this guy still alive?
[209:17.19]I don't understand that.

[212:02.12]Okay.
[212:07.60]Let's fight Olivia.
[212:11.28]Oh, she's got a bicycle pump.
[212:12.34]Look out.

[212:59.43]What what what what what what what what what what are they counting down?
[213:02.23]What's counting down?
[213:02.89]What are you doing?
[213:03.85]I don't know what this means.
[213:08.27]I feel like it's bad for me though.
[213:09.33]Thought he was gonna jump.
[213:19.54]Let's go with some long-range artillery fire here.
[213:31.58]Where did you come from?
[213:32.28]I did it.
[213:34.22]I win.
[214:02.92]Alright.
[214:04.54]That was fun.
[214:05.96]Got it.
[214:12.99]I guess that was a good thing, yeah.
[214:17.79]You did it.
[214:20.65]Zero secrets.
[214:23.24]I'm not looking for secrets.
[214:24.30]I found one secret and it was just a doll.
[214:31.89]I think I've arrived in hell.
[214:37.87]I kind of want to upgrade this thing.
[214:41.69]Here's the time to reload the next shot.
[214:43.45]Yes, I will take that.
[214:46.47]Penetrate targets.
[214:47.39]I don't have enough, but... What else can I do?
[214:56.78]How's the game pushing my system?
[214:59.68]Not really at all.
[215:01.08]Runs pretty well.
[215:02.30]Even when streaming and recording.
[215:06.48]So it's working pretty well.
[215:12.28]This is the... What is it?
[215:17.82]Fire the burst.
[215:18.54]Yeah, I'll take it.
[215:27.00]Vacuum 2.
[215:31.14]I'll keep vacuum on.
[215:34.33]I'm running at 50 or 120.
[215:35.91]I believe it's... I'm not actually sure.
[215:37.39]I'm pretty sure this is 100 something.
[215:39.03]At least like 60.
[215:47.37]Dexterity.
[215:49.57]Switch weapons faster.
[215:50.56]I don't really care about that.
[215:57.70]Power up.
[215:58.06]We're up on... Activating a power up.
[215:59.42]Health will be filled.
[216:05.29]Total number... Yeah, there we go.
[216:06.39]We can throw more grenades.
[216:07.81]I like that.
[216:15.51]Is that Satan?
[216:20.54]Alright, Satan.
[216:24.34]This game just changed into a different game.
[216:27.56]We were fighting on like the moon or Mars.
[216:30.70]Now we're in hell.
[216:45.32]Does that find the exit portal?
[216:46.72]Okay.
[217:00.67]Show your head.
[217:04.39]It only took me like 15 shots to hit that guy in the head.
[217:12.56]Gotta go that way.
[217:19.87]What is this?
[217:20.39]Is this a saw blade gun?
[217:24.73]Gauss cannon.
[217:34.60]Okay, so that's pretty sexy.
[217:37.52]Sexy.
[217:38.81]That's pretty sexy.
[217:39.91]How many gas?
[217:49.70]No, there's gas.

[218:00.66]They're so annoying.
[218:13.70]Zarya's gun.
[218:14.42]It actually does look like Zarya's gun.
[218:15.98]It actually fires like Zarya's gun too.
[218:24.22]This is just Zarya.
[218:40.41]Get you a head blown up.

[219:22.64]Anything over here?
[219:23.22]Hmm, just poison.
[219:31.76]It looks like I can climb up these rocks.

[226:18.38]I do not want to do that.
[226:22.86]That doesn't sound like very much fun.
[226:24.14]Okay, this is... This is kind of unbearable.
[226:40.83]Just want to play Team Deathmatch.
[226:44.31]Do we really have to sit here?
[226:45.43]What are we, banning and picking phase?
[226:47.05]Come on.
[226:47.55]Let's go.
[226:48.17]Let's do it.
[226:59.30]God, Doom, you got me on my phone right now.
[227:14.57]Requiring people to ready up in 2006.
[227:16.11]Yeah, it seems like you could just go.
[227:25.56]And we're sitting here.
[227:27.82]Loading screen to loading screen to ready up screen to loading screen.
[227:30.60]Hmm.
[227:38.12]Okay.
[227:43.44]Okay.
[227:48.00]I thought that was a guy.
[227:49.04]You can count more time?
[227:51.00]Another 15 seconds?
[228:02.44]Ash in one.
[228:05.01]Ash in circle.
[228:05.75]Thanks a lot.
[228:06.21]Welcome.
[228:06.63]Thank you for subbing.
[228:09.11]Hope you're enjoying this exhilarating stream right here.
[228:29.05]I thought that was going to kill him.
[228:33.05]We're kind of all just jumping around in a circle.
[228:41.79]That works.
[228:42.15]I have a double jump here, too.
[228:52.95]I think I picked that.
[228:53.66]That's fine.
[228:58.38]Where's the other team?
[229:02.32]I have not seen another bad guy.
[229:12.62]Lots of enemies.
[229:19.53]Box.
[229:19.83]I don't know what that does.
[229:22.71]Bigger box.
[229:32.03]Where are you?
[229:34.67]Show yourself.
[229:36.37]It's actually not that bad.
[229:45.12]I mean, I can't see myself playing this, like, all day.
[229:50.34]What the fuck?
[229:52.78]Wow.
[229:55.27]That should just crush that guy against the wall.
[229:57.81]Okay, I am inherently more interested now.
[230:19.18]Ooh, that's like some type of sniper rifle that guy's got.
[230:28.03]Where'd he go?
[230:35.26]Demon possession.
[230:38.56]Interesting.
[230:40.54]So that guy turned into that?
[230:41.88]That's kind of cool.
[230:58.32]I went invisible.
[231:00.62]Of course, it's an FPS in 2016.
[231:02.60]There has to be a guy that goes invisible, right?
[231:05.41]Is that what I just saw?
[231:17.21]What settings am I... I'm running on high.
[231:22.83]Games on high.
[231:24.23]Pretty much defaults on high.
[231:31.01]Ooh, I'm getting electrocuted.
[231:38.93]Still not dead.
[231:46.59]Shit!
[231:47.79]Mr. Dream.
[231:48.45]Of course, Mr. Dream puts it down.
[231:51.02]That's a screen that shakes a lot.
[232:01.34]Demon rune.
[232:02.53]Oh, everyone has to run to it.
[232:04.77]Give it to me.
[232:08.49]Where's the demon rune?
[232:09.43]Is that guy using it?
[232:12.22]Ow.
[232:12.30]He got sniped.
[232:37.59]Apparently not.
[232:44.09]Let's try another class.
[232:47.33]Let's try, uh, Ambusher.
[232:53.09]This is not bad.
[232:54.05]I'm not, like, hating this, guys.
[232:59.57]I hate it.
[233:00.47]Fucking insta-dead.
[233:01.29]Game sucks.
[233:14.48]I wonder how much damage this does.
[233:15.60]I wonder if it's any good.
[233:16.40]You don't really get a movement penalty when you use it like this.
[233:23.79]Oddly enough.
[233:40.44]Ooh!
[233:42.24]What?! !
[233:43.87]I just bricked it in his face and it didn't do anything?
[233:46.75]You can actually do damage with that?
[233:49.35]Did not expect that.
[233:50.29]I don't like this class.
[233:55.78]Are we gonna win?
[234:20.26]I won.
[234:22.98]I guess.
[234:25.62]That was kind of fun.
[234:27.06]That's... This is, like, fun.
[234:32.74]I mean, it's not the greatest thing I've ever played in my entire life.
[234:37.52]Okay.
[234:39.72]Those dance moves.
[234:41.66]Those... Ugh.
[234:54.29]I'm convinced.
[234:58.01]No, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if we didn't have to wait like three minutes to play another game.
[235:03.26]Look at this intermission.
[235:10.24]60... 70 fucking seconds.
[235:16.49]In... In no way is that even remotely acceptable.
[235:23.17]I'm sorry.
[235:30.05]Like, almost more than a full minute of intermission.
[235:39.84]Would it be easier if I just left the lobby and then joined again?
[235:42.84]I feel like I should just leave.
[235:57.28]This is going to happen after every game, right?
[236:03.91]That is not... Okay.
[236:12.29]I guess we're playing another game.
[236:17.14]People have to finish customizing their dances between games, really.
[236:20.20]I know.
[236:26.72]Bunnyhopper?
[236:27.24]What the hell does that mean?
[236:29.24]This looks like a cool map.
[236:31.87]Play single player?
[236:32.58]I just played the single player for about four hours.
[236:34.62]I'm going to play this for a little bit and then probably end the stream.
[236:39.25]I didn't want to stream for more than like five or six hours today.
[237:01.99]And this, too.
[237:02.51]This takes forever, too.
[237:06.57]You gotta keep people interested.
[237:08.03]Let's go, go, go, go, go, go.
[237:11.18]And then another 20 seconds here.
[237:12.86]Wait, what?
[237:15.72]Kun Choi.
[237:17.34]Three months.
[237:17.88]Thank you, dude.
[237:19.75]But you see, like, look at this.
[237:21.51]This is like three to four full minutes of time between games.
[237:24.41]Four.
[237:28.09]But welcome back, dude.
[237:29.13]Thank you for resubscribing.
[237:30.55]That is a three month anniversary.
[237:31.97]It's our three month anniversary, dude.
[237:33.91]Oh, I think I hit him directly.
[237:40.60]Fuck.
[237:42.66]I like the rifle.
[238:03.33]What the fuck even killed me?
[238:05.77]Trying to melee that guy.
[238:39.58]What is right clicking on this dude?
[238:43.00]Whoops.
[238:45.22]They're all over there.
[238:46.06]Oh, Winston shield.
[238:46.80]See if Winston's there.
[238:51.74]Damn.
[238:52.82]Kind of getting stomped right now.
[238:54.00]Sneak up on this guy.
[239:13.87]Yikes.
[239:20.62]Yeah, we're getting beat.
[239:23.98]Bye.
[239:39.11]See ya.
[239:40.95]That's a second environmental death.
[239:49.02]He's not using any hack modules.
[239:53.47]It's my second game ever.
[239:54.63]I kind of don't really just kind of play and get a feel for the gameplay.
[240:00.96]Oh boy, he turned into one of those.
[240:04.88]Holy shit!
[240:17.44]Yeah, everything is on an angle.
[240:18.56]You're right.
[240:18.88]I didn't even notice that.
[240:20.20]I keep instantly dying.
[240:30.39]What's the gun that he has?
[240:31.85]That thing kills you in one hit.
[240:33.73]I'm going to use it.
[240:42.96]It has to be a sniper rifle with a charge.
[240:53.64]It's got that shotgun too.
[240:54.75]It's got this crazy shotgun.
[241:04.17]Damn.
[241:07.84]I didn't have time to react.
[241:13.52]I hit that guy two times before he shot me.
[241:15.94]And I still instantly died.
[241:31.08]I'm getting chainsawed.
[241:31.83]What the fuck is going on?
[241:46.62]Give me the demon rune.
[241:47.28]I want to play with it.
[241:53.16]Shit.
[241:53.54]Somebody got it, I think.
[242:11.48]This announcer doesn't even care.
[242:13.72]He kind of just is like... Demon spawned.
[242:18.12]Magnet activated.
[242:19.34]Damn.
[242:30.21]Can you show us some melee finishers?
[242:31.55]I would love to, but I keep dying over and over again by the other team.
[242:45.73]Damn it, I was running his head too.
[242:46.95]Oh, that's a teleporter.
[243:07.26]I thought it was like a mine.
[243:08.10]I thought that was gonna be like a little detonator.
[243:20.89]I was at the demonic room, was I?
[243:22.09]This dude's fucking 18 and 4.
[243:32.78]Are you shitting me right now?
[243:34.03]This game came out yesterday.
[243:55.31]Oh, he's trying to melee him.
[244:03.10]That tele is OP as fuck.
[244:04.46]Is it really?
[244:04.80]I feel like I shouldn't be going down here.
[244:27.57]Yeah, we got crushed.
[244:35.75]The demonic room appears where the demon dies.
[244:37.65]You will... I'm leaving this lobby.
[244:41.99]I'm gonna get out of this lobby.
[244:44.43]We got fucking dudes going like 20 and 4.
[244:48.85]Look, we're like just a team of shitheads.
[244:50.52]And these guys are like all fucking like 3 times 3 KD.
[244:53.30]Get the fuck out of this lobby.
[245:01.06]Game sucks.
[245:04.28]What a soul harvest.
[245:10.66]I'll try this.
[245:26.52]At least this is not a full two minutes.
[245:34.74]Alright, let me look at these.
[245:36.78]Alert you to nearby enemies.
[245:39.80]Displayed respawn timers.
[245:45.46]I mean, I have no idea.
[245:48.52]I guess I'll take alarm.
[245:49.82]60 seconds times 1.
[245:57.41]What about loadouts?
[245:58.89]Can you actually... Fuck.
[246:01.09]Too bad I didn't have a 60 second intermission.
[246:18.23]Feel like I was playing better on this guy.
[246:32.54]So what is this just kill confirmed?
[247:05.81]This is a weird level, a lot of corridors here.
[247:14.04]And a lot of health.
[247:29.40]Whoa!
[247:31.28]Diablo just killed me.
[247:39.69]I just got killed by Diablo.
[247:50.96]Sounds like a lawyer.
[247:53.60]Talking about me or talking about the guy narrating?
[248:08.73]Wow.
[248:10.55]Did not expect to see you around that corner.
[248:16.53]Stockpile.
[248:17.55]Supply timer.
[248:18.66]Sure.
[248:34.66]Teammates.
[248:37.20]You'd love to have me as a lawyer?
[248:38.78]We'd lose every case.
[248:39.86]I can actually see him through the wall.
[248:52.73]Shit!
[248:53.09]I have a degree in criminal law.
[249:02.20]It'd be really weird if I did.
[249:10.21]Is that gonna spawn there?
[249:10.95]Oh, we have the demon now.
[249:14.12]Does that mean we win?
[249:15.28]We get the demon?
[249:27.33]He's almost dead.
[249:33.73]Jeez.
[249:41.16]Got a germology degree?
[249:42.32]That's a pretty odd degree to have.
[249:44.82]What do I just, like, know of it?
[249:52.34]Alright.
[249:53.87]I just spawned and somebody stuck a chainsaw in my stomach.
[249:57.61]You're a demon.
[250:05.21]You're a demon.
[250:05.77]God.
[250:11.70]There's so many ways to die instantly.
[250:14.70]And I haven't figured out what they all are.
[250:16.30]What the fuck was that?
[250:25.97]Was that a grenade?
[250:26.75]Was that a bomb?
[250:30.37]That's the third time I've exploded.
[250:48.87]Give me these.
[250:49.25]I don't know what they are, but I'm going to take them.
[251:04.03]Whoa.
[251:08.25]We still have the demon.
[251:09.67]We still have the demon.
[251:13.76]Don't scare me like that.
[251:23.71]Mitt Romney with the... with the frag.
[251:32.71]Ah!
[251:33.36]He's on fire.
[251:34.02]Damn.
[251:35.72]Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn.
[251:41.64]Alarm?
[251:42.10]What does that mean?
[251:53.28]Yeah, that guy takes a lot of hits.
[251:54.84]Uh-oh.
[251:55.66]I think they have a Diablo.
[252:02.75]Jump to this guy where he is.
[252:16.62]Whoa!
[252:20.30]Did I get...
[252:25.74]What is going on?
[252:27.98]What is going on in this game?
[252:40.43]Really?
[252:40.71]I didn't kill that guy.
[252:43.27]I swear to god those hit him like...
[253:02.97]That guy's so dead, is he?
[253:04.05]Yeah, he's dead.
[253:13.04]Nooo!
[253:15.48]Stay away from me, please.
[253:26.91]What?
[253:28.81]Did his trip over the banister and die?
[253:33.24]I think I just fell over the banister.
[253:36.30]Ah, this is not the Zarya.
[253:56.19]This is the rocket launcher.
[253:58.44]Itchy nose.
[253:58.86]Hold on.
[254:00.90]Star, I have an itchy nose.
[254:02.00]What did you do?
[254:18.83]That was a lot of damage.
[254:19.63]Let me see it!
[254:27.80]Give it to me!
[254:28.90]Oh, here we go.
[254:30.28]I have no idea what's going on.
[254:31.50]I'm the bad guy, though.
[254:35.71]Okay.
[254:37.25]No!
[254:37.89]What?
[254:38.43]No!
[254:39.23]I wanted to play with that.
[254:41.65]No, that's not fair.
[254:43.77]Give it to me and take it away.
[254:48.04]No.
[254:58.41]I just got so robbed.
[255:12.80]If only I had a level 3 chin.
[255:18.20]No, leave game.
[255:19.46]Get out of here.
[255:21.06]Why would you ever sit in that?
[255:34.71]This might be my last game before I go take a break.
[255:46.67]This might be the last one before I break.
[256:02.00]Go get a snack or something.
[256:03.18]We've got a long time to wait.
[256:06.40]You know, we got a full minute of time.
[256:12.46]Not that big of a deal.
[256:14.83]Yeah, no.
[256:15.57]Not a big deal.
[256:33.36]What the hell is that, like, code this guy just put in the chat?
[256:42.74]Look at my loadouts for a second.
[256:46.52]Can't really do anything.
[256:49.51]Super shotgun.
[256:51.27]And... Burst rifle.
[256:54.77]And... Frag grenade.
[257:00.92]Okay.
[257:03.34]Isn't that just the sniper?
[257:04.20]I just made the sniper, I think.
[257:10.92]I don't know why I timed him out for it.
[257:14.16]Yeah, who knows?
[257:18.74]Take a shower, you sweaty boy.
[257:20.12]I will.
[257:21.86]After this game, I will.
[257:31.21]Jerma, just wanted to let you know I've been with you since the beginning of this intermission.
[257:34.19]I found a wife, had kids, and became a successful zookeeper.
[257:38.45]Well, you still got time to wait.
[257:58.75]Really odd gun.
[258:04.71]This is like something is stuck in the drain gun.
[258:09.69]Oh, crass.
[258:51.83]I didn't get an assist for that.
[258:52.68]I did like 50 damage to him.
[258:53.98]I did like half of his health.
[258:55.44]Where's my assist?
[259:02.44]I think we're gonna... We have two.
[259:32.45]Just pepper him.
[259:33.03]Just pepper him a little bit.
[259:41.88]That's not fun.
[259:43.12]That's not cool.
[259:43.92]I don't know what hit me.
[259:49.06]Anybody know?
[259:50.26]Because I don't.
[260:03.27]Give me that health.
[260:04.79]Wow.
[260:10.05]So much going on down here.
[260:16.25]There's like a million different things going on down there.
[260:20.76]I'm gonna sneak and watch this, guys.
[260:29.38]This dude is done.
[260:40.44]I did a lot of damage.
[260:42.38]I did a lot.
[260:43.08]He exploded.
[260:43.54]I did that.
[260:45.10]I'm just going to say I did that.
[260:46.84]Even though it probably wasn't me.
[260:49.97]Put on the Zaraxas cam.
[260:57.17]Demon Lord Zaraxas.
[261:11.24]This thing's actually kind of cool.
[261:12.08]Did he teleport over there?
[261:27.28]My kids are disappointed in you?
[261:29.48]Why?
[261:29.80]What did I do?
[261:30.26]Nice punch.
[261:37.68]You punched him.
[261:41.80]Not doing so hot right now.
[261:45.32]This level looks like it was taken out of Castle Griffinsteed.
[261:47.56]It kind of does.
[261:48.20]Shit.
[262:15.80]Oh, he snuck over here.
[262:17.02]I got the kill.
[262:30.72]Health, please.
[262:34.67]What?
[262:35.83]What?
[262:40.21]I don't believe that for a second.
[262:56.39]Give me another one.
[262:59.73]Oh, give me another one.
[263:00.85]That's three.
[263:05.63]Looks like we're in the lead.
[263:06.87]What up?
[263:37.51]This guy's running 100 miles per hour.
[263:44.34]My Minecraft series comes back next week.
[263:46.66]Thought he was going to jump into it.
[264:01.57]Don't hurt me.
[264:04.56]Don't.
[264:05.72]Hurts me.
[264:06.24]Please.
[264:06.94]Give me the money.
[264:16.18]Anybody on the bridge?
[264:18.14]Hmm.
[264:18.72]I did see somebody on the bridge.
[264:29.85]Cap it.
[264:30.99]And then we win.
[264:35.11]Destroy him, son.
[264:38.20]Destroy him, please, for daddy.
[265:02.85]Wait, what?
[265:04.67]Wait, what?
[265:06.01]Hey, Zeus.
[265:07.45]Hey, Zeus23.
[265:07.97]Thanks a lot, dude.
[265:10.73]Welcome.
[265:11.29]Welcome back.
[265:15.25]Pfft.
[265:33.31]I actually thought we were going to win right when I jumped off.
[265:36.81]But I was, uh, I jumped the gun a little.
[265:40.90]I was hoping that it was going to be 250, 240, boom.
[265:48.15]It's alright.
[265:48.63]It's fun.
[265:49.81]I can't say it's the, uh, the world's greatest multiplayer I've played, but it's cool.
[266:02.38]So... Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls... Uh... I'm just gonna fucking chill, you know?
[266:21.45]Thanks for watching.
[266:23.31]I'm gonna take off.
[266:25.77]You want my final consensus on Doom?
[266:30.13]Uh, it's pretty good.
[266:31.86]If you like shooting monsters, it's good.
[266:35.16]Nothing really was like, whoa, this is the greatest fucking game I've ever played, but it's still, uh, still good.
[266:44.22]Still good.
[266:51.81]Bye, daddy.
[266:55.59]Uh, you know what?
[266:56.15]Hold on a second.
[266:56.83]This is gonna be fun.
[267:01.20]Is Renee streaming right now?
[267:02.90]I think she is.
[267:03.44]Alright, guys.
[267:07.10]Don't go too overboard.
[267:09.06]Don't fucking... Don't keep doing... Keep spamming shit, but just... I think we're gonna raid Renee.
[267:15.38]We're gonna fucking throw up her chat for, like, a few seconds.
[267:22.40]So... Go, uh... Go here.
[267:28.02]Go there.
[267:29.62]Bye, guys.
[267:31.50]Have fun.
[267:32.32]I'll see you later.
[267:34.11]I'll probably stream tomorrow.
[267:36.05]Take it easy, guys.
[267:36.93]Have a good night.
[267:38.07]Bye-bye.
