[00:02.03]Why is that in my head?
[00:09.97]Because every time we touch the ceiling, I reach for the stars.
[00:16.81]Who said that?
[00:18.50]Who in here said that?
[00:19.48]Who in here made that reference?
[00:27.26]I don't know why I'm singing that.
[00:29.26]It wasn't on TV or anything.
[00:36.34]Do you have a custom mechanical keyboard?
[00:39.33]No.
[00:39.45]I mean, I have a Corsair mechanical keyboard.
[00:44.11]I'm actually a mesh keyboard fan.
[00:47.77]I think I've gone over this before.
[00:51.37]Something about the individual buttons, I kind of get stuck in them.
[00:55.90]I like laptop keyboards the most.
[01:00.12]I just want a laptop keyboard without the top part of the lap.
[01:03.36]You know what I mean?
[01:04.38]I just want a lap.
[01:08.19]If I could sit here with that sitting right on my lap, but there's no... I love laptop keyboards.
[01:12.80]They're the best.
[01:16.38]Mechanical keyboards, I don't... I like them, but... I don't know.
[01:21.30]The fact that you can hear somebody typing on a mechanical keyboard from, like, three houses down.
[01:27.92]I... That's fucked up.
[01:31.91]I don't think it is.
[01:37.90]And do I really need a mechanical keyboard?
[01:40.64]Think about it.
[01:43.23]Yeah, membrane.
[01:44.03]Yeah, membrane, mesh, whatever they're called.
[01:49.59]I like them more.
[01:50.39]They're more comfortable.
[01:58.40]Anyways, hi.
[02:00.06]I'm a little late.
[02:01.50]Just by a little bit, but whatever.
[02:02.76]How you doing?
[02:09.40]Yeah, if I say two, guys, you get it.
[02:12.23]My streams used to start at four.
[02:14.37]Now if I say two, I, alright, I'm gonna, I'm definitely gonna start before four.
[02:19.19]This is my way to get here before three o'clock.
[02:24.82]We can hear the poop line.
[02:25.84]That's actually a green tea.
[02:28.10]Ban that guy for an hour.
[02:31.76]You were late by 36 minutes.
[02:37.11]Please accept my friend request.
[02:38.81]I'm not going to accept a friend request.
[02:40.37]What are you talking about?
[02:55.04]You need to accept.
[02:55.76]I'm not accepting anything.
[02:57.64]I'm not accepting anything.
[02:59.88]It's green tea and it's based.
[03:01.03]Yeah, it's a green tea powder.
[03:03.65]And you know what?
[03:04.19]It is.
[03:05.25]It is based.
[03:05.85]What I'm drinking right now is based.
[03:08.23]And I'm safe to say that.
[03:14.70]Okay, so what are we doing today?
[03:17.10]First of all, how are you doing?
[03:19.02]Second of all, we're going to do it with testing the chat again today.
[03:23.80]A couple days ago, we made the reference of playing Freddy Fish, the entire Freddy Fish cinematic universe.
[03:31.89]And I was told, oh man, you have to do it.
[03:35.97]That's gonna be so awesome, dude.
[03:37.31]Please play it.
[03:38.07]Please.
[03:38.27]Oh my god, Freddy Fish is my childhood.
[03:40.56]Get in there, dude.
[03:41.42]Get in there and play Freddy Fish.
[03:43.86]So we're gonna find out.
[03:45.44]A lot of people wanted me to do this.
[03:47.54]And after about 20 minutes, if all of you are fighting each other, then I'm gonna know if this was, you know, worth doing.
[03:59.24]I did not know this, but there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Freddy Fish games.
[04:08.34]I thought there were two.
[04:11.23]I am not going to play all these.
[04:15.05]I'm not going to play all seven of them.
[04:18.39]Maybe I'll play one or two, or maybe, I don't know.
[04:23.33]If I get sick of this shit...
[04:25.69]I'm going to move on to Unpacking.
[04:28.69]Which is a chill game where you... decorate a room.
[04:32.41]You unpack stuff into a room or something.
[04:36.75]So that should be fun.
[04:40.41]Play the second one, please.
[04:46.19]We're starting... I'm sorry!
[04:48.93]We're starting with the first Thor movie.
[04:52.37]Okay?
[04:54.54]You don't just skip to Ragnarok.
[04:58.32]We gotta watch the first two Thor movies, guys.
[05:09.29]You gonna go insane over this?
[05:10.73]I don't think so.
[05:15.57]There's no second Thor movie.
[05:18.35]There isn't?
[05:20.32]Isn't there two Thors?
[05:21.12]Wait, isn't there like Thor 2?
[05:23.29]What's Thor 2?
[05:24.01]Yeah, there is Thor, the dark world.
[05:27.89]Yes, there is.
[05:42.14]It doesn't exist.
[05:42.86]Okay, so you guys didn't even know that existed.
[05:44.68]It's the worst movie ever.
[05:46.26]I... I don't remember that movie.
[05:49.65]I don't even know if I saw it.
[05:50.47]Did I watch that movie?
[05:51.31]I don't know.
[05:54.37]Okay, so here we go.
[05:55.03]We're gonna play Freddy Fish.
[05:55.94]This is Freddy Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds.
[06:00.03]Mods, I want you to do, I want you to monitor the chat for, you know, negativity, swears.
[06:08.13]I need to see how they enjoy this game.
[06:10.68]So, we're going to monitor for negativity, swear words.
[06:13.58]I think, I almost just, okay, I almost just turned off the stream.
[06:16.10]That was bad.
[06:19.18]I remember monitoring them for negativity.
[06:21.28]Negativity.
[06:22.54]That's a lot of syllables.
[06:23.92]Negativity.
[06:26.80]Five syllables.
[06:27.54]Negativity.
[06:28.23]Negativity.
[06:36.07]Fuck this game.
[06:39.67]Why?
[06:43.71]We haven't even started playing it.
[06:50.87]You know what?
[06:51.75]I'm going through the first one at least.
[06:54.91]You're going to have to vote if you want to see the second one.
[06:56.59]You guys ready?
[06:56.99]You've been waiting a long time.
[06:58.88]Let's go.
[07:05.71]Can you see me?
[07:07.78]No?
[07:09.56]Can you see the game?
[07:12.48]Not yet, hold on.
[07:14.52]Freddy Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds.
[07:19.14]Can you hear it?
[07:27.80]Oh, there he is!
[07:28.40]No, that's not Freddy.
[07:30.99]Where am I?
[07:35.12]Thanks for getting the flowers, Sam.
[07:37.92]Sure thing, Freddy.
[07:40.10]They're wonderful.
[07:41.45]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[07:43.41]Gotta go, Sam.
[07:44.67]Bye, Freddy.
[07:45.65]Alright, Freddy Fish, the curse of the missing kelp seeds.
[07:51.93]You look like a villain.
[07:54.09]That's fine.
[07:55.83]Did you part your hair?
[07:58.13]No, I didn't.
[07:59.25]Wait, did I?
[08:02.68]No, I'm just balding.
[08:04.72]And it's going back.
[08:05.66]Hi, Jason.
[08:08.06]Want a flower?
[08:09.34]Sure.
[08:11.10]Did any of this matter?
[08:12.81]Thank you.
[08:13.85]Where are you going, Freddy?
[08:15.57]I'm bringing flowers to Grandma Grouper.
[08:17.85]Grandma Grouper.
[08:21.73]Nice receding hairline.
[08:24.31]Yeah, talk to me when you're 40.
[08:26.69]You know, stuff like that used to really kind of freak me out and scare me.
[08:30.85]I don't fucking care.
[08:32.53]I don't care anymore.
[08:33.53]Hi, Grandma Grouper.
[08:34.85]Here's a flower for you.
[08:36.37]Ten years ago, I was like, ooh.
[08:37.67]Thank you, Freddy.
[08:38.30]Wait a minute.
[08:38.84]I've got to make sure it looks okay.
[08:40.12]Come on, Grandma Grouper.
[08:41.92]Someone took my treasure chest.
[08:43.22]I don't care.
[08:43.76]I could go ball tomorrow.
[08:44.62]I wouldn't even care.
[08:45.70]Grandma, your treasure chest that holds all the kelp seeds.
[08:48.92]Yes, Freddy.
[08:50.06]Look at the garden.
[08:50.92]Pay attention.
[08:51.40]It's dying.
[08:55.33]Classic cartoon comedy.
[08:56.47]So we're gonna find the treasure chest.
[08:58.76]What else are we gonna do?
[09:02.00]Ugh.
[09:02.38]I don't need to pay attention to this game.
[09:04.66]I don't need to pay attention to this game.
[09:06.88]This is every Nick Jr.
[09:07.60]cartoon.
[09:22.29]in one go.
[09:24.41]I don't need to pay attention to that.
[09:25.43]Alright, so I got my jellyfish sandwich.
[09:29.09]Why does anybody need to pay attention?
[09:32.26]Pay attention to what?
[09:33.08]Freddy Fish?
[09:34.90]Fuck this guy!
[09:36.40]Wait, do you think he's fucking funny?
[09:37.68]Alright, so what do I do?
[09:42.68]Is this too loud?
[09:51.13]Don't disrespect Freddy Fish.
[09:55.15]Okay.
[09:59.79]Ooh!
[10:00.45]Everything's clickable.
[10:01.51]R1, R1, R1, R1.
[10:03.77]Okay.
[10:04.59]So I gotta go find... I don't know.
[10:05.97]I don't remember.
[10:06.93]I'll run into somebody that can help me.
[10:21.70]Oh, that's cute.
[10:23.61]Oh, that's cute.
[10:24.47]Oh, did you hear that banjo?
[10:35.59]You can't... Don't do initial... Wait, you're doing a poll already for an initial impression?
[10:38.84]We've been playing the game for less than two minutes.
[10:42.26]Nice comb-over, comb-over Andy.
[10:49.14]Hi, Luther.
[10:50.06]What are you doing?
[10:51.20]I'm trying to swim a loop-de-loop.
[10:54.40]Ow!
[10:55.30]How long is this game?
[10:56.40]Hey, Freddy.
[10:57.60]Bet you can't swim a loop-de-loop.
[10:59.60]It's easy.
[11:03.06]Wow!
[11:04.36]Let me try again.
[11:05.31]Ow!
[11:08.43]Just move backwards five feet, dude.
[11:11.69]I cried as a kid playing this because I got stuck.
[11:14.57]And there's a note inside.
[11:18.17]You're a fucking idiot.
[11:19.87]What?
[11:20.03]All the fish are going to die if we don't do this.
[11:43.67]That's... Okay, that got a little... It says, to find Grandma Grouper's treasure chest, go near the beach.
[11:50.41]Go near the beach.
[11:51.05]Alright.
[11:51.77]So where is the beach?
[11:53.47]Alright, let's go this way first.
[11:58.58]This game is really hard.
[12:00.86]I doubt it, but that's fine.
[12:02.54]The bottle ain't here, boss.
[12:06.24]Maybe somebody else found it first.
[12:09.87]Maybe somebody else found it first.
[12:13.33]Of course someone else found it first, you sponge head!
[12:16.51]Come on, we gotta find that bottle!
[12:19.37]Oh, it's shark bait!
[12:21.23]Boist.
[12:21.57]But boss, we are sharks!
[12:27.21]Okay.
[12:34.58]Pretty good at cat puke, alright at the bat.
[12:37.44]Alright, so now we gotta go to the beach.
[12:41.12]Should we go to the crown?
[12:42.96]Can I read these signs?
[12:47.99]Click on everything.
[12:48.55]Click on everything.
[12:52.21]Nice.
[12:53.71]Okay.
[12:55.82]Oh, boy!
[12:57.52]I want to do that one again.
[12:59.70]I like that one.
[13:02.28]That's my favorite guy so far.
[13:04.12]That's my favorite character.
[13:07.14]One more.
[13:08.74]No, not even close.
[13:10.50]One more.
[13:11.47]Yeah, that's a good one.
[13:14.79]That's a good one.
[13:15.47]I like that one a lot.
[13:18.79]Just keep going?
[13:30.64]Okay.
[13:32.08]What do we do?
[13:38.06]Do we push?
[13:39.32]Pull?
[13:39.82]Pull!
[13:40.88]Pull!
[13:42.04]Pull!
[13:43.72]I'm giving it all I got, Captain!
[13:49.29]Save.
[13:51.29]Sorry, Luther.
[13:52.37]Don't mention it.
[13:54.40]So we're going to go in there.
[13:55.14]Who's in there?
[13:55.88]Are you happy?
[13:57.64]Are you happy?
[14:01.12]I'm just curious.
[14:03.80]I'm asking.
[14:04.66]Are you happy?
[14:05.20]Okay.
[14:05.71]I'm just checking in.
[14:06.81]Actually, I am too.
[14:07.89]This is fun.
[14:08.33]I like this.
[14:21.23]We gotta get a crowbar.
[14:22.57]Crowbar.
[14:23.07]Pull.
[14:23.19]Push.
[14:23.41]Twist it.
[14:23.69]What's that?
[14:24.37]Can I prop this underneath here and crank it?
[14:49.52]We already have one.
[14:58.34]I don't get it.
[15:00.05]I don't get it.
[15:00.91]How do I do this?
[15:03.47]I don't fucking get it.
[15:04.13]I don't wanna play.
[15:05.01]This game's fucking stupid.
[15:06.29]Fuck this game.
[15:07.33]I don't get it.
[15:07.71]I don't understand.
[15:08.43]Like, they didn't make it clear enough for me.
[15:11.01]Like, why don't games make shit clearer?
[15:12.47]You know what I mean?
[15:13.15]Anymore?
[15:16.01]I'm fucking done.
[15:18.14]That's like... That made me feel a little bit better.
[15:21.52]Okay.
[15:23.98]I don't have the item, so we gotta go.
[15:29.11]Did you find my guppy?
[15:30.73]Yes, Mrs. Halibut.
[15:31.67]Gabby's stuck, but he's okay.
[15:34.35]Oh, thank goodness.
[15:36.91]So... We're just gonna leave.
[15:39.62]Let's go find the next bottle, Freddy.
[15:41.86]I hope we find Grandma Grouper's kelp treasures.
[15:44.20]Alright, bye.
[15:45.80]Hopefully you're...
[15:47.16]It's okay.
[15:47.80]Oh, another bottle!
[15:48.58]Oh, guys, look!
[15:49.28]Another bottle!
[15:50.92]We just left him.
[15:56.02]I should have left a sandwich.
[15:57.02]Alright, I'm sorry.
[15:59.16]If this is me, I'm leaving the sandwich.
[16:00.93]I'm gonna be like, hey.
[16:03.01]Gary, whatever your name is.
[16:04.33]This is a peanut butter and jellyfish sandwich.
[16:06.59]This will last you at least fucking a few hours.
[16:09.49]So, if you want it, you know what I'm saying?
[16:14.52]Why leave the sandwich for him?
[16:16.26]Alright, go to the junkyard, go to the beach.
[16:19.36]What's that?
[16:19.68]Got it.
[16:19.94]Let's go save that kid.
[16:20.98]Urchin?
[16:21.28]Alright, let's go.
[16:21.68]This is a Jax moment, yeah.
[16:42.03]I'm imagining somebody crying because they can't beat this.
[16:44.91]I literally did.
[16:45.47]That's so sad.
[17:11.35]That's so sad.
[17:12.19]Okay, we got a key.
[17:17.67]Wait, what happened?
[17:18.37]What happened to the... Do I have... How much stuff do I have in my inventory?
[17:23.55]Is this... Can I have more than this?
[17:28.72]Or am I going to run out of space?
[17:31.84]We're going to raid?
[17:33.30]Yeah, I miss raids, man.
[17:34.96]I've been missing raids when they come in.
[17:37.77]People will raid this channel with hundreds or thousands of people and I'll just be like...
[17:44.28]So where are we going?
[17:45.55]That's rude.
[17:46.09]I don't want to be rude.
[17:47.73]Thanks for the raid.
[17:49.03]That's Chipley.
[17:50.37]Thanks for the raid, Chipley.
[17:52.09]Appreciate it.
[17:54.72]Welcome, guys.
[17:55.32]Playing Freddy, uh... Fish's...
[17:58.79]Adventure of... I don't know.
[18:00.57]Whatever this game is.
[18:01.29]There's like ten of them.
[18:01.93]Who cares?
[18:03.11]How do we get the pearl?
[18:04.55]I like this guy.
[18:05.21]I like this guy.
[18:05.99]A clock?
[18:28.66]Alright, that was cool.
[18:29.86]The super duper... What is it?
[18:31.99]Write it out.
[18:32.37]The super duper what?
[18:36.23]The super duper.
[18:38.19]I love a lot of syllables, so I found this one.
[18:40.11]What is it?
[18:41.43]The super duper.
[18:43.55]It's the super duper duper.
[18:45.39]The super duper duper gala gizmo.
[18:47.89]And if you get the super duper duper gala gizmo, I'll give you a clock.
[18:52.45]Whatever it is.
[18:57.51]I want to go back...
[18:58.76]To where the kid was trapped.
[19:02.44]Did I go the wrong way?
[19:03.58]How do I go back that way?
[19:06.52]Where's the map?
[19:12.73]Is there a map?
[19:13.19]Alright, let's go in here.
[19:16.21]I know I'm doing this for a fact.
[19:24.02]I got you.
[19:25.98]Just wait.
[19:28.00]Check this out.
[19:29.23]See ya.
[19:30.83]Now what do I get?
[19:40.22]A purple sea urchin?
[19:42.10]Is that currency down here?
[19:45.48]So I got two... What do I do with this?
[19:47.56]Alright, I gotta go to the beach.
[20:06.62]I have a key, I've got a sandwich, I've got a... conk shell.
[20:13.75]I'm gonna go back this way.
[20:17.68]Yeah, let's go ahead.
[20:18.16]Let's head up here.
[20:18.88]To the castle.
[20:20.08]Castle.
[20:21.56]Conch.
[20:22.16]Conch.
[20:22.56]Whatever.
[20:23.18]Wait, maybe this guy wants a purple one.
[20:24.34]Turn that shell down.
[20:25.88]I wish I could get some sleep, Freddy.
[20:28.24]But this shell, it glows all day.
[20:31.06]It glows all night.
[20:32.80]I wish I could trade it for a shell that doesn't glow.
[20:36.14]I got one of those.
[20:37.96]Alright, let's go.
[20:39.60]Herman, I brought you a new shell that doesn't glow.
[20:43.38]Will he fit into this?
[20:45.22]That's huge.
[20:53.65]Here, Freddy.
[20:55.05]Maybe you can use this glowing shell.
[20:58.13]Thank you, Herman.
[21:00.25]Good night.
[21:01.39]I don't know why, but the Curb Your Enthusiasm music was just playing.
[21:07.74]That was the exact same way that it starts.
[21:09.70]It was like...
[21:12.48]Okay, so what can I do with this?
[21:20.52]What do I need to get in?
[21:29.61]Sea urchin!
[21:30.43]What, do I get three of these, four of these, five of these, and I can do something?
[21:37.62]Oh, I don't have to... The guards just let you in?
[21:41.72]Sick.
[21:46.61]Who's that?
[21:48.85]I'm fucking five years old, I swear to God.
[21:52.97]I thought that was funny.
[21:54.45]I thought that was genuinely humorous.
[22:01.06]That's a different person's game.
[22:02.82]It was cute.
[22:05.62]Yeah, it's fine.
[22:06.22]Whatever, I don't care.
[22:10.21]Alright, what do you want?
[22:12.99]Alright, so is this a case of I gotta get through Season 1 to enjoy Season 2?
[22:20.84]Right?
[22:26.44]Because this is Season 1.
[22:28.50]Everyone said play Season 2.
[22:29.96]Play Episode 2.
[22:33.60]We'll see.
[22:33.94]I actually enjoy this.
[22:35.26]I don't hate this.
[22:36.58]I'm having a good time.
[22:45.12]Feels weird, man.
[22:46.22]What?
[22:47.28]Oh my god, what is... Oh, look at these!
[23:13.00]Alright, what do you welcome to my kingdom with all my shells and pearls?
[23:19.55]But what really makes it very grand are all the boys and girls?
[23:26.27]Cool, so what do you want?
[23:32.27]It's Grandma's last... It's a key!
[23:34.27]It's a glowing chest!
[23:35.59]It says, to find Grandma Grouper's treasure chest, go to the junkyard.
[23:39.84]What do I do with this?
[23:41.06]This is kind of loud.
[23:41.82]Let me turn it down.
[23:43.10]Just a little.
[23:44.68]I do love my beautiful pearls.
[23:47.96]Okay, you like pearls.
[23:50.80]So do I bring a pearl, maybe?
[23:53.21]I do love my beautiful pearls.
[23:56.87]Give him something.
[23:57.53]I can't.
[23:57.95]It's Grandma's last peanut butter and jelly... Alright, well we're gonna leave.
[24:02.68]Now it's too quiet?
[24:03.68]No need.
[24:07.02]There.
[24:07.24]Alright, so I can't do anything here yet.
[24:09.66]Let's go back.
[24:10.08]I need to go to the beach.
[24:15.77]They specifically said beach.
[24:18.09]What the hell?
[24:25.38]Oh, Shito!
[24:26.82]Hold on, it's been three minutes.
[24:28.94]There.
[24:29.58]There.
[24:33.89]This is a library-ass game.
[24:40.21]This is a library-ass game.
[24:45.79]Alright, I gotta go find the beach.
[24:54.59]I have a distinct memory of trying to play these games, but I just didn't- I didn't understand how to install video games.
[25:02.76]Back in, I want to say, like, DOS.
[25:05.54]Because here's the thing that you guys don't understand.
[25:07.07]DOS was a huge pain in the ass.
[25:09.97]I don't know if this was on DOS.
[25:10.93]This is 94.
[25:12.81]I want to say, like, 1991, 1992, maybe?
[25:17.47]DOS, it wasn't just, oh, I'm going to double-click this game on my desktop and it's going to open.
[25:22.98]You used to have to put the CD, like, the floppy in, get it to run, go into prompts, command prompt, and get the shit to run.
[25:32.07]It was actually kind of a pain in the ass.
[25:33.78]For a little kid, I didn't get it.
[25:39.36]Just type CD.
[25:41.04]No, sometimes it didn't work.
[25:42.04]Sometimes you had to install it and then run the EXE from the mounted drive and shit.
[25:46.81]It was weird.
[25:49.05]Type slash cheat.
[25:50.05]That wouldn't work either.
[25:50.73]Alright, let's keep going.
[25:54.37]You lost to a floppy drive.
[25:58.80]That was after DOS.
[26:00.26]It was something... Okay, so Windows 3.1 ran on DOS, but sometimes you had to go into DOS to do certain things.
[26:08.07]It was weird.
[26:15.27]Oh, it's the beach.
[26:19.79]Do I get that now?
[26:24.30]Windows 98 actually still ran on DOS.
[26:26.54]Did it really?
[26:32.92]Should I do something?
[26:33.40]What do I do?
[26:35.88]Oh, there's a log.
[26:44.58]On July 14th, there's going to be a baseball stream on this channel.
[26:49.00]It's going to be the Cincinnati Clowns versus the Maryland Magicians.
[26:52.62]I would suggest you stick around for that one.
[26:54.94]July 14th.
[27:00.71]Fiddler Crab, what's wrong?
[27:02.17]Oh, I got a key.
[27:03.23]Oh me, oh my.
[27:04.53]Oh me, oh my.
[27:05.55]How did I get in this cage?
[27:08.21]I must get out of this cage.
[27:10.40]Please help me get out.
[27:12.64]And I'll give you my fishing pole.
[27:17.06]That was a banger.
[27:17.84]This key should get you out of the cage, Fiddler Crab.
[27:25.28]I have a question.
[27:27.52]Thanks for unlocking the cage.
[27:30.97]Crabs always kind of scare me, and lobsters too, because they have those claws.
[27:40.54]How much damage would those actually do to a human hand?
[27:44.06]If, for instance, I fed the crab, right?
[27:50.57]If I fed the crab went bang on my fingers, would they just chop him off?
[27:57.65]Would it just break the skin?
[27:59.33]Would it break the bone?
[28:00.57]How bad would it be?
[28:03.71]I always have this distinct kind of vision in my brain that if a lobster gets my finger, it's gonna saw it off.
[28:16.60]It could absolutely sever your finger.
[28:18.88]It depends.
[28:20.30]Damn.
[28:20.44]Damn.
[28:26.52]It'd be a bad cut.
[28:27.92]But you'd probably keep your thingy.
[28:33.83]What about a pistol shrimp?
[28:34.85]Alright, why don't you give me the... Oh, alright.
[28:36.91]So what can I do with that?
[28:43.25]Whoa.
[28:47.28]What the hell is this?
[28:49.81]Three buckets of jellyfish.
[28:51.75]I'll toss the jellyfish to the hungry animals.
[28:54.31]I'll toss the jellyfish to the hungry animals.
[28:57.18]It's feeding time.
[28:58.42]I could probably do something like... You fed that one, Freddy!
[29:03.84]What?
[29:04.22]Alright, Freddy!
[29:22.11]Now it's time to do it on hard!
[29:23.65]And all of a sudden fucking guitar hero buttons start coming down and through the fire and flame starts playing.
[29:31.31]And they just start running out.
[29:38.57]You missed one?
[29:39.29]I don't think it really matters.
[29:48.13]How close can they get?
[29:50.54]Is this the part that you cried at?
[29:52.00]Is this the part that you cried at?
[29:55.00]Yes.
[29:55.14]Uh-oh, it is getting harder.
[29:57.04]I was going to say ammo, but technically...
[30:19.67]Whoa, that was crazy.
[30:20.73]23?
[30:20.77]Isn't that a scary number?
[30:22.15]I don't like that number. 23?
[30:47.55]Yeah, it's like a scary number.
[30:49.65]What do you mean question marks?
[30:54.94]The number 23, right?
[30:55.80]Wait.
[31:04.23]Hold on.
[31:05.77]The scary thriller Jim Carrey movie, the number 23, is not based on any actual real folklore.
[31:14.90]They just made that up for the movie.
[31:19.24]I'm being dead serious.
[31:33.97]You fed them all.
[31:34.89]Let's play again, Freddy.
[31:36.49]Turtles love jellyfish.
[31:38.21]No, not they made the number 23 up.
[31:40.10]I'm saying did they make up the folklore around how scary the number 23 is?
[31:46.26]Or is that actually number 23 is seen in a lot of different places?
[31:51.26]My game's lagging.
[31:56.16]So they made that whole thing up for the movie.
[31:58.18]It was just for the movie.
[31:59.30]What?! !
[32:00.88]You did great, Freddy!
[32:03.16]You have all three buckets of jellyfish left!
[32:04.54]There are more hungry animals back there, Freddy!
[32:06.70]Make sure you toss the jellyfish into the animals' mouths!
[32:33.19]It was just made up for the movie, but I thought it was all these, like, weird biblical references.
[32:41.93]I thought it was like the Da Vinci Code, right?
[32:43.47]Where it's like, oh, Leonardo Da Vinci had a secret map to a treasure in the United States.
[32:48.39]Wait, no, that's a Nick Cage movie called National Treasure.
[32:52.54]Well, you know what I mean?
[32:54.66]I thought it was something like that.
[32:57.22]I thought it was like a biblical thing.
[32:58.72]I don't know.
[32:59.20]Okay, I just minimized the game.
[33:03.46]Stop!
[33:09.39]Wait, wait, wait.
[33:09.85]How can I pause this?
[33:13.44]The number 23 has been directly mentioned several times in the Bible.
[33:15.90]14 times, to be precise.
[33:16.99]This goes to show its significance in the Bible.
[33:20.57]The judge of Israel, 23 years of service.
[33:22.41]It's also worth noting that Jehovah was 23 years old when he inherited the throne and became Judah's new king.
[33:26.99]Interesting.
[33:28.16]Yeah.
[33:29.38]Sorry.
[33:29.88]So I was right.
[33:31.26]I was right.
[33:35.08]I was right.
[33:35.68]So they didn't make this whole thing up for the Jim Carrey movie.
[33:45.76]2 divided by 3 is 666.
[33:46.54]That's what I'm saying, sir.
[33:48.90]What do you mean question marks?
[33:51.68]Yeah, it's an actually biblically accurate scary number.
[34:07.07]What?
[34:07.29]It's a scary number.
[34:08.89]It's... Hold on.
[34:09.78]Is this mic not loud enough?
[34:14.47]Have I thrown 157 of these?
[34:15.38]Two divided by three is not... What?
[34:16.44]Dude, you can do that with any number.
[34:38.21]You know what else is really funny about this whole scenario?
[34:41.01]I've never even seen the number 23 with Jim Carrey.
[34:44.35]I've never seen the movie.
[34:46.57]I just knew it was a scary number movie.
[34:50.69]And I looked it up on Wikipedia.
[34:53.33]And it was like, oh, the number 23 is scary.
[34:55.33]Jim Carrey writes it down a million times.
[34:57.77]No, you know what?
[34:58.35]I think I saw the trailer.
[35:00.52]I think I saw the trailer and I was scared of the number.
[35:04.24]I swear to God.
[35:04.78]I really think that's what happened.
[35:07.87]I never even saw the movie.
[35:09.61]I don't even care if I lose.
[35:12.01]I have 200 points.
[35:14.03]No five-year-old is going to get 200 points.
[35:20.18]Let me just win.
[35:34.69]Alright, I have 200.
[35:35.55]I don't want 223.
[35:35.99]I want 250.
[35:36.25]I don't want 230.
[35:36.55]This is fine.
[35:37.13]I want something else.
[35:38.13]240 is fine.
[35:39.75]I don't like that number.
[35:40.71]That's like an odd number.
[35:43.79]I want an even number, like 250.
[35:46.16]Okay.
[35:46.78]I'll touch it.
[36:00.74]Huh?
[36:00.84]What are you talking about?
[36:01.92]I have to do this again?
[36:03.34]Why do I have to do this again?
[36:05.31]How do I leave?
[36:06.09]I can't click the arrow on the top left.
[36:09.11]Alright, I'm just gonna lose.
[36:10.61]The number 23.
[36:12.11]Why did it scare me so much?
[36:32.65]I don't care if I lose.
[36:33.65]Hold on, this is important.
[36:46.01]Make sure you toss the jellyfish into the animal's mouths!
[36:59.21]I'm not trying to play.
[37:00.09]I'm trying to find this trailer.
[37:01.81]How did I do, Luther?
[37:02.89]Why did this scare me so much?
[37:04.25]Let's feed some more animals, Luther.
[37:07.61]We have three buckets of jellyfish.
[37:11.11]It's feeding time!
[37:15.88]Why can I not leave?
[37:17.18]I'm trying to just leave.
[37:25.30]Too bad, Freddy.
[37:29.27]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[37:37.13]Alright, Freddy, I don't care.
[37:40.17]How do I shut him up?
[37:46.98]How do I get out of this?
[37:49.16]There's something else important going on right now.
[37:52.70]Okay, I left.
[37:55.72]Alright, why did this scare the shit out of me so much?
[38:01.16]Let's find out.
[38:03.44]I never saw the movie.
[38:05.46]Okay, let's go.
[38:17.23]Where is this?
[38:19.91]Okay, let's see why I was scared of this so much.
[38:26.34]Why does it look like such shit?
[38:27.38]I suppose I'm buying that for you, too.
[38:33.35]Actually, I've had a good long time to flip through it.
[38:35.33]Why don't you give it a try?
[38:37.45]The number 23.
[38:38.01]A heart-wrenching odyssey into paranoia.
[38:40.51]One of the most horrifying metamorphosis ever told.
[38:43.54]I'm buying this for you.
[38:45.96]Chapter 1.
[38:46.74]All I could think about was the number.
[38:50.97]I met you when I was... 23.
[38:52.23]And the day we met was?
[38:54.87]September 14th.
[38:55.36]9-14.
[38:55.40]14 plus 9 is?
[38:55.80]23.
[38:55.90]Is it all just a coincidence?
[38:56.76]I don't know.
[39:04.27]so what is 23 the 23 axioms to euclid's geometry the human body consists of 46 chromosomes 23 from each parent see two divided by three point six six six number the devil so it's 23 blessing 243 240 pixels
[39:22.15]I was born at 11, 12 p.m.
[39:24.25]11 plus 12.
[39:25.01]23.
[39:25.81]My birthday at 2, 3.
[39:27.31]Imagine if this was 230 feet.
[39:29.87]It actually counted.
[39:32.01]You've drawn wild conclusions from them.
[39:35.33]Every 23rd word on every 23rd page.
[39:40.09]I warn you, hell is waiting.
[39:47.20]The number.
[39:47.62]What does that mean?
[39:52.49]Waco, Texas, and the Oklahoma City bombings happened on April 19th.
[39:58.39]He's got to get out.
[39:59.01]It's coming for you.
[39:59.67]4 plus 19 is 23.
[40:01.13]This is not who you are.
[40:02.38]The Hiroshima bomb was dropped to 815.
[40:04.02]Dad!
[40:04.20]8 plus 15 is 23.
[40:04.64]13 years of lies!
[40:06.32]No more!
[40:06.78]Don't do this to us.
[40:07.74]See?
[40:29.21]Okay, well, that's it.
[40:30.11]Number 23.
[40:34.05]See?
[40:34.45]Everything's 23.
[40:35.11]That's why... That trailer scared me.
[40:37.13]I didn't see the movie, but I was scared of the numbers, so I stopped... I started thinking about that, like, wait a minute.
[40:42.77]How many, uh... How many waters come in a case of water?
[40:46.76]23.
[40:47.48]So I stopped buying them.
[40:49.26]They had to be 24, 25 in a case of water.
[40:50.56]It started freaking me out.
[41:04.91]You're actually 5 IQ.
[41:06.11]I don't even know about my IQ.
[41:09.29]I don't know anything.
[41:17.00]23 IQ.
[41:19.30]I don't know, man.
[41:19.90]How old was I?
[41:20.64]When did that movie come out?
[41:22.52]Like 20 fucking years ago?
[41:24.35]How old was I?
[41:25.59]I was probably like... I don't know.
[41:26.81]I don't know how old I was.
[41:28.91]I probably was very influenced.
[41:33.42]It was 23 years ago.
[41:35.46]It actually might have been, and that's fucked up if it was.
[41:38.43]If it was fucking 23 years ago, quiet now, because that's weird.
[41:59.79]You were 23?
[42:05.56]What?
[42:07.18]I was?
[42:12.91]That's fucked up.
[42:13.81]Alright, I was 23.
[42:14.59]What?
[42:14.85]I was.
[42:16.29]It's gonna be 2023 next year.
[42:18.41]9 plus 8 plus 5 is 23.
[42:36.74]What?
[42:37.36]It's not?
[42:38.44]It's 22.
[42:39.66]Check your math.
[42:41.02]For a second, I was like, holy shit, this is weird.
[42:44.74]Alright, I gotta finish this game.
[43:09.72]What do I do with this stuff?
[43:11.24]It's grandma's last peanut- It's a fishing pole!
[43:14.82]We found another purple sea urchin!
[43:21.11]There are 23,000 people watching.
[43:22.61]Is there?
[43:23.15]That is not-
[43:45.71]It's not.
[43:46.03]It's like 17.
[43:48.53]Alright, I need to go figure some shit out.
[43:51.58]Alright, so fishing pole.
[43:58.62]What do I do with the fishing pole?
[44:03.46]I actually was scared of that number for a little while.
[44:05.15]It was weird.
[44:09.69]Oh, here we go.
[44:10.17]Alright, so let's go that way.
[44:24.65]I'm Mr. Starfish, your math teacher for today.
[44:28.54]Welcome to class.
[44:30.38]This better not be 23.
[44:32.04]How hard do you want the questions to be?
[44:35.26]Easy, medium, hard, very hard, or advanced?
[44:41.95]Advanced it is.
[44:44.45]What is...
[44:46.26]I thought it was 23.
[44:46.88]I was like, no, it isn't.
[44:52.53]Shit, that's 23 backwards.
[44:56.61]That's 23 backwards, and that's how old I was when the movie came out.
[45:06.24]12.
[45:06.68]You're right.
[45:07.96]Yay, yay, yay!
[45:10.22]Now try this one.
[45:13.25]What is...
[45:15.59]84 plus 14.
[45:17.60]Um... I... Um... Stop.
[45:23.54]Stop.
[45:23.86]I need to get out.
[45:25.34]98.
[45:26.18]Very good.
[45:27.54]Yay!
[45:28.14]Yay!
[45:28.78]Yay!
[45:29.70]We've answered two problems right.
[45:32.46]Now let's try another.
[45:33.28]What is... 53 minus 24.
[45:34.30]Shit.
[45:47.23]Twenty-nine.
[45:48.71]That's correct.
[45:51.53]Let's do another problem.
[45:54.62]What is the difference of twenty-three and twenty-one?
[46:00.92]Two.
[46:05.58]You're right.
[46:06.42]Yay!
[46:07.50]Yay!
[46:08.54]Yay!
[46:09.10]Now let's try another.
[46:12.24]How much is...
[46:15.67]37 minus 21.
[46:20.47]16.
[46:20.85]You're right.
[46:22.20]Yay!
[46:22.64]Yay!
[46:23.30]Yay!
[46:24.24]We've answered five problems right.
[46:27.00]Now try this one.
[46:30.04]What is... 88?
[46:32.30]81.
[46:34.50]That's correct.
[46:36.80]Here's another equation.
[46:38.58]How much is...
[46:41.99]Forty-two plus twenty-one.
[46:45.29]Sixty-three.
[46:48.96]That's correct.
[46:49.60]Sixty-nine.
[46:50.80]Yay, yay, yay!
[46:52.74]Now let's try another.
[46:55.00]You're the devil in the sky.
[46:56.22]What is the sum of forty-one and twenty-three?
[47:01.99]What the fuck, man?
[47:05.75]What the hell?
[47:08.55]Sixty-four.
[47:09.97]You're right.
[47:12.09]Now try this one.
[47:15.11]What is the sum of... Fifty.
[47:18.75]Four.
[47:19.57]And thirteen.
[47:20.67]Sixty.
[47:21.57]Seven.
[47:22.42]You're right.
[47:25.02]Let's do another problem.
[47:26.50]No, I don't want to do another one.
[47:28.52]What is... Sixty.
[47:31.12]Ninety.
[47:31.74]Seven.
[47:32.44]You're right.
[47:35.03]Now try this one.
[47:36.65]Uh, but hold on.
[47:38.13]What is the difference of...
[47:41.55]97 and 65.
[47:43.29]What's that backwards?
[47:54.90]32.
[47:56.02]That's correct.
[47:59.88]We've answered 11.
[48:01.70]Problem's right.
[48:03.04]Here's another equation.
[48:06.18]What is the difference between... I'm done.
[48:08.95]I don't want to do this anymore.
[48:11.51]52 and 10.
[48:13.57]52.
[48:14.03]That's correct.
[48:15.64]Yay, yay, yay!
[48:17.84]Let's do another problem.
[48:19.30]It says stop.
[48:20.84]How much is... I know, but I kind of think I need to get to 23.
[48:28.32]71.
[48:28.40]I'm not doing 23 questions.
[48:29.44]I'm sorry.
[48:31.21]What happened to him?
[48:32.21]Why'd he pass out?
[48:32.85]That was weird.
[48:33.75]We found another purple sea urchin.
[48:38.05]I hit stop.
[48:42.51]That's dangerous.
[48:43.01]That's going to hurt someone.
[48:46.31]Hey, stop that.
[48:54.12]Hey, stop that.
[48:56.42]Cool.
[48:56.78]Alright, let's go.
[49:05.04]Oh, there's a bottle.
[49:06.72]We're gonna be rich?
[49:07.98]We're gonna be rich!
[49:09.72]What's that from?
[49:11.68]Hearthstone, I think.
[49:13.03]Oh, a sandwich!
[49:14.29]It's 3.23 right now.
[49:35.10]Dogfish don't eat peanut butter and jellyfish sandwiches.
[49:41.88]There's more than one way to catch a dogfish.
[49:53.99]I guess we can't get past that junkyard dogfish.
[50:09.49]No, I need different food.
[50:14.15]I need different food.
[50:15.99]Okay, so I need a way to feed the dog.
[50:19.01]We need a bone.
[50:23.03]Yeah, but whatever.
[50:24.11]I mean, I feel like you're just gonna have to... This is clicking from screen to screen, right?
[50:44.95]OK, let's go up.
[50:46.13]23, I'm fine.
[50:50.11]No one gets past Eddie the eel.
[50:59.89]But we're looking for Grandma Grouper's camp treasure.
[51:03.13]If we don't find it soon, all the fish are gonna die.
[51:08.08]Oh, I've heard that one before.
[51:09.90]Look, kids, why don't you just get out of here before I have to eat you?
[51:13.52]Technically, I'm a snake, right?
[51:15.20]They're not fish, right?
[51:16.36]So technically, you could make a funny thing where you say, well, I'm not a fish, Fred.
[51:24.19]It's a glowing shell.
[51:32.00]Mmm, yum.
[51:33.22]Grandma Grouper's famous peanut butter and jellyfish sandwich.
[51:37.28]I guess I could let you get past.
[51:39.34]Good luck finding Grandma Grouper's kelp treasure.
[51:47.04]Looks like the coast is clear now.
[51:49.09]Fucking moron.
[51:49.69]Alright, let's go.
[51:52.63]But first, click all the funny things.
[51:54.69]Click all the funny things first.
[52:03.94]Cool.
[52:06.82]Nice.
[52:08.24]That was fucking 3D.
[52:09.64]That was revolutionary back in 1994.
[52:13.77]That was revolutionary.
[52:15.19]People would probably scream when it was coming up the screen.
[52:18.53]There's the audio.
[52:22.35]Oh, it's too dark.
[52:23.55]I'm scared, Freddy.
[52:25.19]We have something that would help us see.
[52:28.54]The game is too loud.
[52:30.70]Oh, it's because we watched the number 23 trailer and I turned everything way up.
[52:33.98]I'm sorry.
[52:36.20]I can use this.
[52:36.78]That's better.
[52:42.51]We found another purple sea urchin.
[52:50.66]Cool.
[52:50.84]What about that?
[52:54.61]Is that all that was in here?
[52:58.03]Is that it?
[52:58.43]I don't want to miss anything.
[53:03.09]I've got a whole handful of these.
[53:09.11]Oh, check each one.
[53:13.78]I got it.
[53:26.78]This thing's trying to kill somebody.
[53:31.82]What can I do in here?
[53:33.92]Nothing?
[53:36.12]What is this?
[53:39.69]Hold up.
[53:40.19]Jim Carrey himself just cursed you.
[53:42.01]Send this message to 23 of your friends to avoid the curse.
[53:49.41]I was actually scared of that movie.
[53:53.35]I'm scared, Freddy.
[53:55.07]I can't see.
[53:58.65]There.
[53:59.71]Now we can see.
[54:01.23]I'm not scared now.
[54:03.09]Oh, that was cute.
[54:04.93]What about the duck?
[54:34.53]So did I get what I needed from here?
[54:38.27]Is it just cute things to click on?
[54:50.65]So I gotta go left.
[55:00.18]The volcano is this way.
[55:04.45]How come Jerma's funnier on the VOD?
[55:08.37]I don't know.
[55:09.11]What are you talking about?
[55:14.75]This is number, uh... Oh!
[55:16.59]Look at that.
[55:20.35]What does that mean?
[55:21.51]Should I keep these?
[55:24.83]Do I need these anymore?
[55:29.93]Should I keep these?
[55:44.40]Do I need them?
[55:45.68]You don't need them anymore?
[55:47.22]Okay.
[55:48.44]Alright, so I gotta add another slot.
[55:53.73]Let's go to the volcano.
[56:01.39]That was sick.
[56:10.82]That was really cool.
[56:12.36]You know what?
[56:13.10]You know, think about this.
[56:14.42]What a fun job.
[56:17.81]Think about how fun this is.
[56:18.77]So some of the artists and the game director and stuff, they sit around and they come up with this piece where, look, we got a volcano and some kelp and some rocks.
[56:29.96]And then they go, you know what?
[56:30.78]What happens if you click on them?
[56:32.50]And they come up with these really funny little cool things that happen when you click on everything.
[56:36.96]Just with this empty canvas, they go, alright.
[56:39.74]When you click the kelp, they're going to spin around.
[56:41.42]It's going to make a cartoon sound, and it's going to sneeze out a fish.
[56:44.91]And then it does just that.
[56:47.75]That's really cool.
[56:51.35]This would be fun to do.
[56:54.43]Whoa, he almost made it.
[57:13.47]The theater is over here.
[57:14.69]The theater?
[57:16.20]You're an actual child?
[57:18.38]I'm just talking about how the game is interesting.
[57:21.44]It's a fun thing for young kids to be engaged with.
[57:26.62]I'm reviewing the game.
[57:27.73]I like that guy.
[57:38.49]You're 46.
[57:42.24]How old do you think the game director of this game was when they made this game?
[57:48.88]Guys, other 10-year-olds don't make games for 10-year-olds.
[57:54.64]A 9-year-old didn't make this.
[57:59.56]Who do you think is making the games?
[58:03.18]It's not like a room full of toddlers in oversized suits pretending to be adults.
[58:07.45]A 23-year-old made it.
[58:11.77]Still.
[58:18.01]It's a great show.
[58:21.72]Step right up.
[58:24.02]Oh, I like that one.
[58:25.56]Alright, let's go.
[58:29.79]Let's see the show.
[58:30.79]Alright, shh.
[58:35.35]Quiet.
[58:39.05]Where did it clap?
[58:40.34]Don't be a fucking rude asshole.
[59:07.47]This better be funny.
[59:19.42]That's it?
[59:19.80]Hey, how much was your ticket?
[59:26.12]Yeah, $39.
[59:27.28]Me too.
[59:28.40]That's not it, right?
[59:31.38]There's more.
[59:31.77]It has to be.
[59:35.26]alright okay okay that's the real show this is why shushing the show kick that person out
[60:06.87]You're going to shush the act?
[60:08.11]Alright, that was a guy getting... Jeez!
[60:24.21]Jeez!
[60:25.01]That guy just got... That guy died.
[60:29.43]Jeez.
[60:31.09]Sheesh.
[60:47.28]Is there nothing else to do here?
[60:53.78]That was the worst sheesh.
[60:55.50]They're not saying, what are they saying?
[60:56.92]They're saying, jeez.
[60:59.86]I'll try to get it.
[61:00.48]Sheesh!
[61:11.68]Nobody else did it!
[61:12.44]Why did nobody else do it?
[61:16.62]You all fucking set me up!
[61:22.61]Let's leave.
[61:28.26]Wait, is it another show?
[62:05.25]They were speaking... Somebody said Jermaese.
[62:12.30]That's a Jerma joke.
[62:14.04]Don't say... Please.
[62:24.90]That was fantastic.
[62:29.75]I like that.
[62:31.05]Again, more.
[62:46.97]So why is this act way better than the frog?
[62:50.03]The frog's trying to do a good job.
[62:51.39]This would be a live show if I did it.
[62:58.44]I would get a one-star review.
[63:06.85]I would probably have the worst rated show.
[63:09.32]It would be like... It would be like 15% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[63:15.88]It was like the Jerma985 comedy special.
[63:18.18]It would have 15% on Rotten Tomatoes and a like 60% audience score.
[63:26.13]You know what I mean?
[63:27.97]We can pretend it was alright, but not all of us.
[63:30.45]Not all of us are going to do that.
[63:35.67]Oh, there's another one.
[63:42.55]Come on.
[64:12.11]Alright, if I'm gonna have to rate the performances here.
[64:20.74]Wait, there's more.
[64:31.94]Holy shit, that was fucking phenomenal.
[64:34.28]That was absolutely phenomenal.
[64:35.38]That's the best one so far.
[64:37.06]That's the best one so far, without a doubt.
[64:38.88]Without a single doubt in my mind.
[64:43.43]And that was only one third of the act.
[64:51.07]The nuance is different.
[64:52.25]The nuance is different between that and the first one.
[64:54.47]Holy shit, man.
[64:56.85]The different kind of order that those played out in.
[64:59.11]It's just such a small difference, but it made a big difference.
[65:02.84]One more.
[65:10.26]The end of that one spoke directly to me.
[65:14.20]Because it wasn't just a cut-off clip of a frog, it was the whole sound.
[65:18.98]You finally get to hear the whole sound effect.
[65:22.49]There's more!
[65:48.99]Everybody has three.
[65:52.39]Everybody has three acts.
[66:19.62]How many are these?
[66:20.36]The Flying Carp Brothers?
[66:21.62]That's not even that hard.
[66:40.24]That's not even... They're swimming.
[66:41.28]That's not even hard.
[66:42.38]What you're doing is not hard.
[66:43.90]I don't know about this one.
[66:51.29]Nah, that's an F. That's an F. Sorry, I don't even want to see the next one.
[67:04.06]No, that's an F. It is.
[67:21.58]Perfect.
[67:23.10]Love it.
[67:28.61]What?
[67:28.89]Are you serious?
[67:31.39]They didn't give him a chance.
[67:32.69]Get back out here.
[67:36.85]That's you.
[67:52.28]I don't agree with the audience.
[67:53.66]I think... I don't agree with the audience at all.
[67:57.51]Don't agree.
[68:01.71]This is Puffo.
[68:02.49]I don't get it.
[68:07.07]I don't get it.
[68:26.70]See?
[68:28.79]Everyone in the audience, y'all fucking threw your tomato at the turtle that didn't deserve it.
[68:33.33]I still got mine.
[68:46.50]Bump and gump.
[69:03.79]Do they have any more?
[69:07.37]Or is that it?
[69:11.23]And their sign has graphics.
[69:18.46]A lot of other people had more than one act, so I'm gonna have to deduct points from that one.
[69:26.25]Okay, so, what do we got?
[69:28.43]Frank the Fabulous Frog is, um... Okay, Helga was S tier, number one.
[69:36.69]What was this one?
[69:47.43]Alright, this is alright, but you're just a worse version of the guy with the shells.
[69:55.90]Where are they?
[69:57.22]This one, right?
[70:00.96]Yeah, to me, just a worse version of Luc Fisch von Bastoven.
[70:08.05]Yeah, I mean, I felt that.
[70:09.01]I felt that in my bones.
[70:13.73]Your winners are Helga and Luc Fisch.
[70:16.97]I don't need to say any more.
[70:31.32]I don't want to burp, but I've got to.
[70:34.09]Alright, so where do I go from here?
[70:36.15]Now what?
[70:39.49]I can't shake my drink anymore.
[70:41.53]I don't like drinking on camera either.
[70:47.41]I feel like I do weird shit with my mouth and I don't even want to see it.
[70:51.42]Alright, so where do I go?
[70:53.78]Is that just a secret unlockable?
[70:54.90]Okay.
[71:03.82]So this is just an unlockable.
[71:11.26]That's cool.
[71:16.78]These are nice backgrounds.
[71:18.34]No, it is.
[71:18.80]The art's really nice.
[71:21.94]Alright, so I gotta go... Um, down?
[71:26.14]I can go down here.
[71:27.06]Ooh.
[71:27.72]This place is scary.
[71:34.27]No, it's beautiful.
[71:35.83]Look.
[71:36.23]Oscar the Grouch?
[71:47.59]How come the Super Frog is not in the talent show?
[72:01.03]Did anybody else think it's fucking weird that we just... All of us just all go, yeah, yeah, it's normal for that to be down there.
[72:08.96]Why?
[72:09.20]Why would we think that's... There are fish... There are stuff down in the deep sea that make their own light with their heads.
[72:15.32]And they're weird monsters and shit.
[72:18.72]We just are like, yeah, that's fine.
[72:20.64]There's like giant, weird, scary monsters down there.
[72:23.18]Okay.
[72:25.76]That's whatever.
[72:27.96]A huge amount of the sea is not even explored.
[72:30.82]Yeah.
[72:37.74]They're just minding their own business.
[72:41.24]Isn't it weird, though, that those things exist?
[72:47.20]What else can I... Nothing to do with her?
[72:49.87]Go to the junkyard?
[72:50.63]I need to get a bone.
[72:51.53]Only 23% of the seas has been explored.
[72:53.37]That's kind of crazy.
[73:08.50]Okay, I'm gonna go back.
[73:24.29]You're flipping off children.
[73:29.83]You know my favorite comment is this one?
[73:31.77]If you care so much, why don't you explore it yourself?
[73:40.75]We only know about 5% of the universe.
[73:42.63]Yeah, the fact that the universe itself is just so weird.
[73:50.11]Okay, where do I go from here?
[73:54.76]I need to go find a bone.
[74:01.48]Where would I get bones?
[74:11.09]It was a skeleton.
[74:15.27]Where was it?
[74:16.81]The whale bones.
[74:17.46]Where were they?
[74:22.58]I forgot.
[74:22.94]Yeah, they're around here, right?
[74:44.46]Oh, wait, I have a fishing pole now.
[74:46.18]I can probably get that.
[74:48.56]That won't help us get through the net.
[74:49.72]What are you talking about?
[74:51.92]No thanks.
[74:58.70]You need the sooty-doopy-doopy-doopy polygizmo like I need another clock.
[75:03.47]I need to get a clock?
[75:04.19]And I do need another clock.
[75:07.65]Find a clock.
[75:08.21]The old whale bones are over here.
[75:10.38]Alright, let's go get the bone.
[75:11.16]We're going to go to the dog.
[75:11.94]We're going to get the thing over there.
[75:13.48]Get a bone.
[75:14.00]Here we go.
[75:28.51]Do you guys think that there's another Earth where the only difference is they just have one nostril and that's the only difference?
[75:35.83]Nothing.
[75:36.17]Everything else is identical.
[75:49.83]Yeah.
[75:53.11]Oh, it's a multiverse.
[75:54.03]I don't believe in multiverse.
[75:59.29]I don't believe in multiverse.
[76:00.07]It pisses me off that like one of the Jermas hit the fucking lottery and I didn't.
[76:03.25]That makes me angry.
[76:08.13]You know, like one of the Jermas has huge muscles and is like six feet tall.
[76:12.27]That pisses me off.
[76:13.17]I don't even want to believe in it.
[76:14.45]I don't want to even know it's real.
[76:15.97]That annoys me.
[76:24.78]If I get, like, if I get, like, a crossover with, like, oh, the Jerma multiverse!
[76:28.08]And there was, like, a tall, like, 6'2 Jerma.
[76:31.00]Jeremy, whatever.
[76:31.62]And he's in a suit.
[76:35.37]I'd fucking shove him.
[76:36.59]I'd be like, get out, shut up.
[76:39.41]I'd be like, bring me another one!
[76:41.75]Bring me another one!
[76:46.15]I don't want this to be my crossover.
[76:50.67]Because I want to be the one in the multiverse scenario where I'm the cool one.
[76:55.10]Where I'm the one that's the good one, right?
[77:09.23]Bring one shorter.
[77:13.35]I'm going the wrong way.
[77:14.01]Go back.
[77:21.67]Yeah, bring me, like, weird cannibal Jerma.
[77:25.14]And Jerma that flunked every grade.
[77:29.70]So I could just be... I'm the one that's the one that can tell... I can be the one that dictates what we do.
[77:35.30]Watch out, no, I wouldn't want a cannibal.
[77:36.82]I wouldn't want cannibal Jerma.
[77:37.87]I don't think I'd want cannibal Jerma around.
[77:41.73]Just bring me, like, caveman Jerma.
[77:43.73]Alright?
[77:44.29]Alright.
[77:57.88]You're the caveman.
[77:58.98]No, I'm not.
[78:02.54]No, I'm not.
[78:03.79]Bring me the dumb ones.
[78:06.51]So I can be the smart one and I can be the one that the movie is based around of.
[78:10.71]Because I don't want to be one of the other ones where the movie's not based on them.
[78:13.77]You know how pissed off that would make me?
[78:15.51]If Chad's 6'2 Jerma with the suit, it's their movie and I'm the side other character?
[78:22.62]No, fuck you.
[78:24.56]Uh-uh.
[78:25.66]That ain't happening.
[78:32.56]You would be the villain.
[78:34.26]No, I don't, no, I want the movie to be, I want it, Jerma goes around the multiverse.
[78:39.46]I don't want, I don't want to be the side character.
[78:41.06]I don't want to have a portal open up behind me and I'm sitting at this desk and I'm the joke.
[78:46.24]The Chad Jerma, it's his movie.
[78:47.90]He's done like fucking 10 scenes already.
[78:50.03]And he's like, oh, so gaming, huh?
[78:51.41]And he like, then I, it's like, I'm the loser guy.
[78:54.96]Like, I look up my shoulder, and he's in my universe, and I'm a side character?
[78:57.90]Nope.
[79:05.64]I'm gonna be ready for him.
[79:08.06]I'm just sitting there, like, I see the portal open, and I'm just sitting there, like, ready to fucking punch.
[79:13.47]He puts his head through, and a fist just hits him right in the square in the fucking face.
[79:18.29]He's just like, and he falls back in the hole.
[79:21.57]And he just sucks around.
[79:25.94]And then obviously the cameras are still in the room, so I look around and I go, it's my movie!
[79:30.38]It's my movie, motherfuckers!
[79:44.19]Where's the junkyard?
[79:49.41]That's a villain.
[79:51.77]Whatever.
[79:55.33]Where's the junkyard?
[79:55.93]I forget where the junkyard is.
[79:56.87]I don't know.
[80:02.01]I actually am lost.
[80:05.70]Is it down?
[80:07.24]No, it's not down.
[80:07.92]I forget where it is.
[80:08.88]I have not been paying any attention to this.
[80:18.57]Imagine the scene after that, though.
[80:20.89]Imagine you going through the multiverse and just one's waiting for you.
[80:24.12]Just fucking full-on punches you square in the face.
[80:28.18]And like smashes your nose in.
[80:31.12]And you have to sit there with the other characters in the movie and be like, why did that happen?
[80:35.59]What was wrong with that one?
[80:38.47]Why did he do that to me?
[80:52.84]And yeah, I gotta be careful, because then I would be in the credits.
[80:58.59]As... Psycho-Jerma.
[81:01.63]No, no, no!
[81:02.47]Real-Jerma.
[81:03.45]I'm Real-Jerma.
[81:04.43]Don't put me as, like, Weirdo or Psycho-Jerma.
[81:06.89]No.
[81:07.37]Real-Jerma.
[81:08.27]That's what I am.
[81:11.51]And... I would be ten rows down on the credits.
[81:16.12]And that makes me angry, too.
[81:18.56]Mm-mm.
[81:19.55]Mm-mm.
[81:20.15]No.
[81:21.13]Not happening.
[81:23.28]Nice, doggie.
[81:25.20]Here's a bone for you.
[81:30.42]Alright, I got it.
[81:34.68]Looks like the coast is clear.
[81:36.92]Now we can pick up that bottle.
[81:38.68]The universes.
[81:41.80]And why do we think that the parallel multiverse universes are different versions of us?
[81:45.90]Go to the three caves and enter the one on the right.
[81:49.90]There's not an infinite amount of versions of us.
[81:54.59]If anything, we're going to jump around the multiverse and I'm going to be sitting in the same goddamn spot with a different shirt on.
[82:01.10]I'll have a green shirt on.
[82:02.22]With the same exact version.
[82:16.81]Not the Squidfather?
[82:19.23]Oh, clam up, Sponge-head!
[82:21.69]You lost the treasure, so now you got to see the Squidfather!
[82:26.46]Oh, please, boss!
[82:28.44]Not the Squidfather!
[82:30.02]He's playing a different game, talking about a different topic.
[82:41.85]Where's green shirt, Jerma?
[82:42.97]He's better.
[82:48.00]Hold on, let me open up the portal.
[82:57.73]It's always like... It's always like this, right?
[83:00.57]Like... They always, like, put their fingers together, like... And they, like, do threading around a thread.
[83:07.79]I've talked about this before on stream, but I'm sorry.
[83:10.37]I don't understand casting.
[83:13.09]I don't.
[83:13.63]I know it's been like, yeah, old material.
[83:16.07]I don't care.
[83:16.40]There's new people here.
[83:18.24]Why do people do fucking casting to cast spells?
[83:21.56]Just go.
[83:22.08]Go!
[83:23.14]Done.
[83:25.76]You don't have to go like this.
[83:27.50]Just go.
[83:27.88]Fireball, go!
[83:31.61]That is a repeating joke.
[83:32.29]That's fine.
[83:42.71]Somebody just said, Yerba Magic's not real.
[83:58.47]So, I'm talking about in... creatively.
[84:16.86]that's linear action that has no mysticism to it the action makes the move come to life poopoo head
[84:53.59]I'm stuck in the car.
[84:55.65]Oh, I got the clock.
[84:56.61]Let's go.
[85:01.67]You'd be the shittiest wizard?
[85:02.67]No, I wouldn't.
[85:04.82]Because I would just go, lightning!
[85:06.00]And the person would go, While they were sitting there doing all kinds of fucking moves for the camera, they've already been struck by my lightning move.
[85:14.20]Because I don't care.
[85:14.88]The bullshit around it.
[85:17.21]I'm just gonna, lightning, get him.
[85:24.40]I like this song.
[85:31.24]But that would be evil.
[85:32.30]No, that would be efficient.
[85:33.38]Alright, where's the clock guy?
[85:48.33]Clock guy's somewhere over here, right?
[85:51.83]Through here and then left.
[85:56.48]Right?
[86:01.51]Dermot, that's just a gun.
[86:04.65]Whatever.
[86:27.41]Now open that up.
[86:28.29]Thanks for the clock.
[86:29.51]You're welcome, Ray.
[86:31.61]Now you get the super duper duka buka poly gizmo.
[86:35.27]Thank you for the super duper duka buka poly gizmo.
[86:38.93]Nice doing business with you.
[86:40.29]Okay, thank you.
[86:44.59]I don't see how this thing is gonna get us through the net.
[86:50.69]Oh, that's how.
[86:52.07]Okay, I feel better.
[87:00.91]Follow the pearl.
[87:04.58]Which one was it in, this one?
[87:07.02]Where is the pearl?
[87:09.92]Bingo.
[87:10.94]You found the pearl.
[87:12.60]Wonderful.
[87:13.93]Take this pearl as your prize.
[87:15.73]Then we bring the pearl to the king.
[87:18.65]Only one pearl per customer.
[87:20.61]Thanks.
[87:21.63]I'll bet King Crab would like this pearl.
[87:26.89]Another one for free.
[87:27.83]I'm leaving.
[87:56.87]The old whale bones are over here.
[87:58.56]No, I don't need whale bones.
[87:59.44]I don't need whale bones.
[88:02.04]Hey, they clap with their teeth.
[88:02.92]That was weird.
[88:04.14]They were like... This game's disturbing.
[88:15.47]No, it's not.
[88:16.03]It's a game for kids.
[88:18.48]The beach is up there.
[88:22.40]I gotta go find the castle again.
[88:23.60]It's back with the crown.
[88:24.16]The crown.
[88:25.74]Go.
[88:26.36]Get up.
[88:30.98]Strawberry magic was disturbing.
[88:32.20]Yes, it was.
[88:33.65]This is not strawberry magic.
[88:35.05]This is, I would say, pretty tame.
[88:42.41]Alright, so now I go this way.
[88:52.15]We go to the castle, bring the pearl.
[88:54.13]I still have a fishing rod, for whatever reason.
[89:06.12]Strawberry magic was a masterpiece.
[89:08.42]Yeah, we powered through that.
[89:09.62]A lot of people didn't want to see it.
[89:13.33]But, we did it.
[89:17.45]Alright, here you go.
[89:18.01]What do I get?
[89:18.37]It's a pearl.
[89:19.53]What a pretty... I love all the citizens of my kingdom.
[89:23.55]We love you too, king crab.
[89:26.61]It's a pearl.
[89:28.01]What the fuck?
[89:29.19]The clue says go to the three caves and enter the one on the right.
[89:34.63]Dude, I already did that.
[89:37.89]I already did that.
[89:44.60]I already did that.
[89:47.23]I couldn't give the pearl.
[89:53.15]This guy's a dictator?
[89:54.33]What?
[89:54.79]Alright, I gotta go back to the big... where the hole was.
[90:04.17]I don't remember, dude.
[90:13.23]Putt putt's better than this?
[90:15.67]That's... I mean, be careful.
[90:19.28]Oh, play Pajama Sam, play... They're all the same exact video game, guys.
[90:22.42]They're the same game.
[90:25.52]They're probably all maybe the same company.
[90:27.28]Alright, one on the right.
[90:40.41]So what was the point of coming in here?
[90:44.24]That wasn't here before.
[90:47.73]I was already in here.
[90:48.41]The clue says the treasure is hidden in the sunken ship.
[90:54.03]Let's go get the kelp seeds at the old ship.
[90:56.35]I know just where it is.
[90:59.26]Oh, wait, this is it.
[91:04.02]The old ship.
[91:06.42]I put all my clues in bottles so I could find my way back to the treasure.
[91:11.68]I thought I put the first bottle at the Nexus.
[91:17.22]But, but, Squidfather... Oh, was the voice bottle with the key?
[91:23.29]Come on, Spongehead.
[91:25.63]Think!
[91:26.51]The Squidfather trusted us to hide the stolen kelp treasure for him.
[91:31.37]But, but, but, but, Squidfather... Oh, no!
[91:36.99]He's spewing ink!
[91:40.80]I remember where the treasure is!
[91:47.17]Come on, sponge head.
[91:51.87]Doesn't a lot look like me.
[91:52.97]Somebody said it's you.
[91:54.77]Look, loser, the sunken ship.
[91:57.35]This is where Grandma Grouper's kelp treasure should be.

[95:07.35]They're not.
[95:08.01]It's just sometimes some cartoon sound effect farts are.
[95:13.27]It's the multiverse.
[95:16.97]Oh dear.
[95:30.24]Oh, it's the Doctor Strange would be sitting there going like this and go, oh, it's me.

[95:36.45]And he makes the circle.
[95:39.55]I'm going to the zoo.
[95:44.36]Magic isn't real.
[95:45.94]I know it's not.
[96:12.15]Ooh, it's a crutch.
[96:14.99]Okay.
[96:18.31]My eyes were looking over here, and just bear with me here.
[96:21.90]So I'm looking right here, and my eyes right here see this is a turkey leg.
[96:26.68]This is a bone and meat on it.
[96:28.46]And I was like, oh, a turkey leg, but it's not.
[96:50.02]Keep going down?

[101:46.30]Alright, so we're about to get the treasure, guys.
[101:50.42]Are you guys ready?
[101:51.42]Guys.
[101:52.52]Let's see what the treasure is.

[102:24.77]TOLD YOU WE'D FIND THE TREASURE, BOSS!
[102:26.93]That was really loud, I'm really sorry.
[102:27.99]OKAY YOU TWO!
[102:28.99]HAND OVER THE TREASURE!
[102:31.80]NO!
[102:33.08]GRANDMA GROOPER'S CALP TREASURE IS DONE FOR EVERYONE TO SHARE!
[102:35.14]I'm sorry, I forget that this fucking thing sucks.
[102:36.52]But we gotta take the treasure to the Squidfather so we can grow some kelp.
[102:43.16]If we share the seeds, we can all grow kelp.
[102:46.26]Share the kelp seeds?
[102:48.36]Gee, boss.
[102:50.28]The kelp seeds are for everyone.
[102:53.93]Wait.
[102:56.03]I got an idea.
[102:57.82]We can share the kelp seeds.
[103:00.78]Great idea, boss.
[103:03.42]Yes.
[103:05.42]Yay.
[103:07.10]Well, that's all it took.
[103:08.24]Let's go tell the squid father we're all going to share.
[103:13.61]All it took was just being like, hey, we should probably just share these.
[103:19.15]Aye.
[103:24.78]Oh, it is just kelp.
[103:33.86]They're really messing up this dev's engine here.
[103:42.01]They're just messing with the grass tool.
[103:45.25]Somebody has to come and clean this shit up.
[103:46.63]Don't let your son on the computer when you're working on a game.
[103:52.02]Freddy, you found the treasure!
[103:58.53]I saved your treasure, Grandma Cooper.
[104:03.17]Well, okay, Freddy helped a little, but I figured it out.
[104:06.74]I was very brave.
[104:09.44]Oh, I'm sure you were, Luther.
[104:12.04]Now, can you both help me plant the seeds?
[104:16.05]In my backyard?
[104:19.05]Of course they'll be for everyone, but I will be the one to dictate who gets what I, you know, who gets it.
[104:24.08]But plant them all in my backyard.
[104:26.60]Of course I'll spread it out evenly.
[104:29.62]I was very brave, Grandma Goodbird.
[104:31.98]There was big, mean sharks.
[104:33.88]They must have been 50 sharks.
[104:35.86]I was dodging left and right, swimming loop-de-loops.
[104:40.10]I'm so proud of you both.
[104:44.23]Why don't we go inside so you can tell me all about your adventure?
[104:49.09]There's so many extra seeds.
[104:55.77]Stop.
[104:56.15]Go.
[104:56.51]What?
[104:57.27]That's my favorite character.
[104:59.79]That's my favorite character.
[105:19.54]Oh, can't you just see this being Smash Bros.
[105:21.32]stage music?
[105:24.58]Three!
[105:25.54]Two!
[105:26.58]One!
[105:27.36]Go!
[105:28.02]So what do I- It's go.
[105:35.66]Here we go again!
[105:37.79]I don't wanna go again?
[105:38.91]I don't wanna go again.
[105:43.27]I don't wanna go again.
[105:53.05]Alright, I need the true ending.
[106:00.63]There is no true ending.
[106:05.03]Alright, so that was fun.
[106:08.13]That was Freddy Fish and the magic of the kelp sheets.
[106:17.56]On to Freddy Fish 2.
[106:19.67]Which I've been told just skip Freddy Fish 1, go to Freddy Fish 2.
[106:23.98]So we're going to find out.
[106:24.86]I'm saying a lot of please no.
[106:28.30]Please don't no, please.
[106:29.10]This is Freddy Fish Day.
[106:42.40]Can we please play Freddy Fish 4 next?
[106:45.44]No, it's Freddy Fish 2.
[106:46.20]Everyone said Freddy Fish 2 is the one you play.
[106:48.76]We did Freddy Fish 1 to get to Freddy Fish 2.
[106:54.30]Well, I guess it's time for you to decide.
[106:57.26]After Freddy Fish 2, final impressions of Freddy Fish Kelp Seed Mystery 5 equals best.
[107:07.68]Okay, you know what?
[107:08.38]This is honestly looks like every Amazon review I've ever seen.
[107:15.19]Even if it's five stars, there's like a shitload of five stars and then a bunch of one stars.
[107:26.66]How do you reliably give something a three?
[107:29.34]I don't think you can.
[107:30.48]You can't do it, right?
[107:31.92]If you're going to leave a review, you either loved it or you hated it.
[107:35.28]I don't know if you make a review on Amazon for something that you just kind of generally thought was okay.
[107:40.12]You don't really.
[107:40.68]You either do it if you love it or hate it.
[107:41.88]Alright.
[107:49.81]So people like that.
[107:50.53]So we're going to do Freddy Fish 2.
[107:51.51]Let's go.
[107:52.47]I'm ready.
[107:53.93]Maybe I should go pee first.
[107:54.87]Should I go pee?
[107:57.52]This is the case of the haunted schoolhouse.
[108:01.83]Okay.
[108:03.65]Let's give it a go.
[108:10.41]Uh... Okay.
[108:16.34]Jesus.
[108:18.44]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[108:19.04]I'm not ready.
[108:21.66]I'm not ready.
[108:22.18]I'm not ready.
[108:22.76]What the fuck?
[108:28.30]There it is.
[108:28.74]Okay, I got it.
[108:30.64]Wait, where the hell is it?
[108:33.06]Where the fuck is it?
[108:36.94]Come on!
[108:37.36]Okay, we're good.
[108:40.78]Alright, let's go.
[108:41.68]This art is worse?
[108:42.68]No, it's not.
[109:00.57]Alright, let's see.
[109:01.13]Are the clickables as good?
[109:02.71]People said this is the one to play, the first one's a bad game.
[109:05.13]I'm already bored that the clickables are not very good so far.
[109:09.21]That was alright.
[109:09.71]I'd give that a 3 on Amazon.
[109:10.65]Okay.
[109:11.45]That's a 5.
[109:32.22]I'm ready for a great day, and I hope you are too I
[110:01.49]I've had my breakfast.
[110:03.77]I've got my books.
[110:06.07]Cold my bin.
[110:08.16]Check out my books.
[110:10.70]Ready for learning.
[110:12.48]And to have some fun.
[110:14.14]Heading off to school.
[110:17.26]Our days speed up.
[110:19.21]Three, two, one, go!
[110:30.79]School is going to start soon.
[110:36.93]Oh, look at that.
[110:49.84]I'll race you to school, Freddy.
[110:51.92]So the school is haunted?
[110:53.30]Is that what I've been told?
[110:55.82]Where are all the guppies?
[110:58.28]We're hiding.
[110:59.78]The guppies say the school is haunted by a ghost, and that the ghost is stealing their toys.
[111:05.73]I saw the ghost, Mrs. Croker.
[111:07.59]It stupefied me with fear, and then it stole my toy.
[111:13.41]Boo!
[111:18.27]Hey, that's my toy!
[111:21.85]Boo!
[111:24.17]That couldn't have been real.
[111:26.73]There's no such thing as ghosts.
[111:29.23]Luther and I will find that so-called ghost and get back all the toys.
[111:35.35]Good luck, Freddy.
[111:37.59]Um... I don't want to do all that.
[111:47.08]Uh... This is... This is Guppy.
[111:50.16]Is somebody... Dave is in the cabinet eating paste.
[111:54.56]We probably shouldn't have him do that.
[112:02.87]Oh, no.
[112:05.21]What is he doing?
[112:11.17]We need to get him out of there.
[112:18.09]It's a multiverse.
[112:18.77]Shut up.
[112:20.43]Freddy and Luther would be the most.
[112:32.37]They should have added songs in this one.
[112:34.15]A lot of songs.
[113:01.73]That ghost scared me out of ten years gross.
[113:05.23]And I'm not even ten yet.
[113:06.63]What happened?
[113:08.47]If we had to get haunted, why couldn't we get a friendly ghost?
[113:13.01]I'm really glad Mrs. Croker decided to stay with us.
[113:16.41]She's great.
[113:18.32]With all this spooky stuff going on, maybe Mrs. Croker will forget to give us homework.
[113:26.90]Okay, bye.
[113:33.48]Does that technically mean make the Earth flat?
[113:38.08]Is that technically right?
[113:44.54]If the Earth was a cube, would it be flat?
[113:46.74]I mean, technically, some of the Earth would be flat, right?
[113:49.64]If the Earth was a cube.
[113:51.66]It's Minecraft.
[113:52.84]I'm just saying, if the Earth was a cube, not a globe, it would be a flat plane.
[114:14.55]It would be three-dimensional.
[114:22.07]Cube does not mean flat.
[114:23.39]But what?
[114:24.87]It would be three dimensions.
[114:27.15]It would be three-dimensionally flat.
[114:36.63]guys no I do not okay scissors will come in excuse me we need to get this really cleared up here immediately I'm just making a thing I'm making a joke as to it turned it into flat sides okay it was merely a jokey reference okay I can't take the glue
[115:08.84]Whoa.
[115:09.12]Get out of there.
[115:25.26]Oh, it's the scrubbing bubbles.
[115:27.50]I love that guy's voice, by the way.
[115:29.83]The scrubbing bubbles, cleaning extra fast with their scrubbing bubble technology.
[115:34.45]I love that guy.
[115:35.17]I love that voice so much.
[115:40.29]You guys know who I'm talking about.
[115:41.49]You know exactly the commercial.
[115:42.57]You know exactly the voice.
[115:43.41]There's a lot more clickables in this one.
[116:09.94]I don't watch Reddit TV.
[116:13.60]Man, I don't think Reddit was even a website when this commercial was airing.
[116:19.88]Vote Freddy for Class Prez.
[116:24.06]That's cute.
[116:24.44]I like that.
[116:26.54]Go Marlins.
[116:29.22]I just kind of broke everything.
[116:41.94]Hey, look!
[116:42.64]That was the ghost!
[116:44.27]Let's get it!
[116:46.23]Hey, you!
[116:49.81]Stop!
[116:55.95]You better look out!
[117:01.65]I'll be back to get that toy!
[117:07.52]Get it out.
[117:08.32]Get it under a microscope.
[117:09.80]Hmm.
[117:32.94]I've got it.
[117:33.92]Let's build a trap to catch that phony.
[117:37.14]See?
[117:37.72]We already have almost everything we need.
[117:41.62]Uh, this is not going to work, Fred.
[117:43.38]This is a list of all the things we need to build our trap.
[117:47.08]We'll just need to get a trident, a wheel for the baby buggy, a mock stock middle box whopper bopper, a cork, and a rope for our trap to be complete.
[117:59.12]I can't sneeze on stream.
[118:00.38]I don't know what's going on.
[118:04.81]Every time I have to, it just doesn't happen.
[118:08.55]I start thinking about it a lot and then I try to mute the microphone and it stops the sneeze.
[118:11.76]Okay, I'm fine.
[118:30.30]Look at all this stuff.
[118:43.55]Come on Are you messing up my joke?
[118:48.86]This dude's stoned?
[118:49.42]Alright, so we gotta trap him in the chandelier
[119:09.38]Okay.
[119:11.56]So we gotta drop that.
[119:15.91]We need to get a few tools.
[119:17.35]Drop that shit on him.
[119:21.61]What are the scissors for?
[119:23.03]Oh, there's a frog from the first one!
[119:40.12]Say it.
[119:40.46]How do you look like this?
[119:44.21]I don't know.
[119:47.17]People ask that question all the time.
[119:48.37]I don't... What do you want to say?
[119:49.43]Good thing we didn't pass up that purple sea urchin.
[119:52.51]It might come in handy.
[119:56.09]Oh, peanuts.
[119:56.81]There's a book about untying knots.
[120:00.68]Okay.
[120:01.34]We may need it later.
[120:10.55]That was fun.
[120:13.31]Okay, I got a book.
[120:20.51]But should I move the painting?
[120:22.61]I'm going to move the painting.
[120:26.07]The clock has blood all over it.
[120:27.39]What are you talking about?
[120:33.29]I wish I could have just done that.
[120:38.69]Let's go down.
[120:47.41]So I'm guessing I need four or five of these again.
[120:54.72]Open that cork.
[120:55.34]Air?
[121:06.94]That's water.
[121:07.74]Just pulling out the cork is definitely not going to work.
[121:11.52]Well, we need a pipe, right?
[121:12.94]Because look, this connects here.
[121:16.85]No?
[121:16.93]It'll connect the pipe.
[121:19.13]I like that.
[121:22.53]Oh, a wrench.
[121:29.77]This is a saw room?
[121:42.24]Okay, wrench, scissors.
[121:45.26]How to untie a knot.
[121:47.45]Hmm.
[121:47.73]Okay, let's go back up.
[121:56.62]Do you know, and I figured this out recently, I had it kind of warped and wrong in my brain.
[122:01.12]Remember I told you guys that I bet, I don't know, whatever, whatever I bet that time, that I said they definitely say the word gas in the Saw movie like a thousand times or something, right?
[122:12.50]I thought, oh, the room's gonna fill with gas.
[122:14.54]No, what it actually was, and this is where I got screwed up, is that there's a poison coursing through your veins.
[122:21.63]There's a deadly nerve poison.
[122:24.11]They all had poison.
[122:25.73]Slow-acting poison was what it was, not gas.
[122:28.67]I had it wrong.
[122:31.05]It's a slow-acting poison in your blood.
[122:35.73]That's what I was thinking of.
[122:46.88]I mean, people, when I said that for the first time, some of you fucking movie transcript Andes went to every script, you found them all, and you Control-F'd gas and told me that it said three times in the whole, like, ten movie franchises.
[123:15.50]Okay, so I'm going to go out.
[123:18.08]Because I have scissors and I have a wrench.
[123:21.70]What should I do with this stuff?
[123:30.49]Wrench here?
[123:31.05]No.
[123:31.15]Control F Andy's.
[123:37.99]So what do I do with the- with this- what do I do with this stuff?
[123:40.57]This is Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
[123:42.13]This is Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
[123:43.43]Yep.
[123:57.40]Oh, yes it is.
[123:58.30]Alright, the cork is down there.
[124:00.50]The rope, I don't know.
[124:01.22]The wheel, I don't know.
[124:02.20]The box-dock-mibble-bop-whopper-bopper.
[124:06.56]Whatever that is.
[124:07.06]And then a trident.
[124:08.52]Okay, so what do I take with this?
[124:13.17]Hey.
[124:17.89]Get him.
[124:23.13]Let's go out here.
[124:27.64]Alright, so this is cool.
[124:28.54]I'm gonna piss my pants.
[124:30.82]I'll be right back.
[125:03.88]Thank you.
[126:25.41]Thank you.
[127:44.32]Thank you.
[129:16.12]Okay, let's turn this off.
[129:17.24]Back to Freddy Fish.
[129:41.89]Why would I be sitting here doing that?
[129:45.90]We just heard angry breathing.
[129:59.57]You gonna play Pajama Sam?
[130:01.35]I don't know.
[130:02.13]People request these games all the time as a joke.
[130:05.37]And then when I actually play them, I go, oh, that was okay.
[130:08.45]I don't really want to play 15 more of these.
[130:13.15]They're cool.
[130:13.77]They're fine.
[130:15.51]But I don't want to play 20 Pajama Sam, Putt-Putt, and Freddy Fish games.
[130:26.84]You know what I'm saying?
[130:32.30]How come?
[130:32.58]What's going on?
[130:37.82]Okay, back to it.
[130:39.66]You can see the wrench, right?
[130:44.96]That's fine, yeah.
[130:47.55]Okay.
[130:48.35]So, what was I doing?
[130:50.15]I was going to... Let's go this way.
[130:59.23]50 community subs from Freddy Dredd.
[131:05.76]Somebody named Big C gave 52.
[131:07.26]You guys give a lot of subs.
[131:08.56]Holy shit, though.
[131:13.12]Oh, my glasses are so very important to me.
[131:16.76]Without them I can hardly see.
[131:19.42]Who is this kid?
[131:20.38]My eyes are so bad I can't say with certainty if you're holding up one or you're holding up two.
[131:30.22]It's a wrench.
[131:33.64]A science magazine and glasses to read it with.
[131:39.07]Life is good.
[131:41.90]I hope this is not a scenario where he loses his glasses, right?
[131:45.99]I'm not gonna hit him with- what?
[131:50.65]Alright, so, uh, what are you looking for?
[131:53.83]Are you looking for something?
[131:55.49]Alright, let's go right.
[132:04.22]There it is.
[132:04.64]There's the pipe.
[132:05.54]Yep.
[132:05.70]So pick it up.
[132:13.38]Oh no.
[132:13.72]How am I gonna get you out of there?
[132:30.40]Could you lend a fin to get this thing off my head?
[132:34.04]We'll try, Tucker.
[132:36.23]Come on, Luther.
[132:38.39]Let's put our backs into it.
[132:41.25]The turtle has his head in it.
[132:43.47]I don't think our backs will fit.
[132:44.99]That looks painful.
[132:45.87]Alright, well, you've screwed that up.
[132:51.04]We're going to have to get some product to get you out of there or something.
[132:53.96]Whatever.
[132:56.16]We're going to come back.
[132:57.34]Is he going to still be alive?
[132:59.58]This is fucked up.
[133:04.31]There's the trident.
[133:17.63]Look, there's another purple sea urchin we can add to our collection.
[133:22.16]Bad end.
[133:25.06]You're leaving him to die.
[133:26.38]That statue is holding the trident.
[133:28.84]Just what we need for our trap.
[133:32.96]Alright, so how do we get the trident?
[133:35.35]Hey, this statue is really attached to that trident, isn't it?
[133:40.71]It's not that, Luther.
[133:42.53]The trident is being blocked by the ceiling.
[133:45.51]Do I have to get rid of the ceiling?
[133:49.26]Oh, great.
[133:57.01]I mean, this thing is already done.
[133:59.61]This is a finished puzzle.
[134:01.37]The kid just needs to click three times to move it.
[134:06.16]You know what I mean?
[134:07.18]This thing's finished.
[134:09.20]I don't have to go too hard with this.
[134:22.51]This shit's done.
[134:23.83]I just need to- Why is this a huge one?
[134:27.89]Why is it so huge?
[134:54.10]No, it was finished.
[134:55.70]They finished it for me.
[134:56.78]Why does that... Okay.
[135:26.67]Why is it a double?
[135:30.48]I would be fine if it wasn't a double.
[135:39.04]It's a fucking double.
[135:46.37]You're overcomplicating it.
[135:47.99]No, I'm not.
[135:48.59]It's a fucking double.
[135:49.69]Why is there a double?
[135:50.71]Why is there a double?
[135:59.41]I don't do... I hate these fucking things.
[136:01.41]I just... Every time one of these comes up, I exit the game or I skip it.
[136:05.61]I don't... I hate it.
[136:08.70]I just hate these fucking things.
[136:10.10]I hate these things.
[136:15.08]Alright, well this obviously is in the wrong spot.
[136:23.45]I hate these things.
[136:25.61]I thought it was already done.
[136:26.63]I thought it was already done.
[136:27.94]I overcomplicated that for myself.
[136:35.32]Yay!
[136:36.64]We got the Trident!
[136:39.81]We need to get four more things to make our trap.
[136:43.09]Alright, we got the Trident.
[136:44.61]Anything else here?
[136:48.20]What's going on?
[136:52.39]Oh, I thought a video was playing in the background.
[136:54.39]Oh, I can keep going.
[136:57.13]Let's go.
[137:12.83]What's this?
[137:14.82]Secret passage.
[137:15.64]No, it's not.
[137:18.95]Stop showing me other games to play.
[137:20.41]I don't want to play that one.
[137:35.05]I guarantee you there is videos on YouTube that are Freddy Fish episode 2, um, the search for the haunted school, colon, brackets, no commentary, clicking on every clickable slowly.
[137:51.76]Guaranteed.
[137:53.24]And the video is just silent and it's just
[138:10.43]That would probably do pretty well.
[138:11.45]That would probably do pretty well.
[138:16.61]Cool.
[138:17.41]I think that would do pretty well.
[138:20.19]Alright, so is there anything I can do here?
[138:29.02]I can't do anything.
[138:46.57]I'm just gonna leave.
[138:49.77]Save the guy.
[138:50.63]What guy?
[138:55.65]Save what guy?
[138:56.57]Oh, that's right.
[138:59.95]I don't know how.
[139:08.34]It's the trident we're going to use to build our trap.
[139:12.38]Alright, I'll be back.
[139:14.93]He's not moving.
[139:15.91]He's not moving.
[139:17.15]It's the trident we're going to use... I don't know.
[139:24.11]What's going on?
[139:38.95]Oh, that was apparently wrong.
[139:39.99]Do it again.
[139:47.28]Come here.
[139:51.36]And pick up the umbrella.
[139:52.52]Pick up the duck.
[139:53.46]Pick up the clock.
[139:55.24]Pick up the starfish.
[139:56.76]Pick up the bag.
[139:59.32]Pick up the kelp.
[140:00.32]Pick up the rock.
[140:10.75]What?
[140:10.93]I don't understand.
[140:11.63]That was so weird.
[140:12.35]Horseshoe!
[140:12.69]I don't think there's anything else here.
[140:15.59]Nope, just go.
[140:18.11]Was there nothing down there?
[140:43.84]Alright, well there's a submarine over this way.
[140:50.60]I got a lot of tools still.
[140:52.72]I'm ready.
[140:53.96]I'm good.
[140:55.20]I'm good.
[140:57.77]Flipper?
[140:58.41]That was cute.
[141:12.56]This would be fun when I was a kid.
[141:21.76]This would be fun.
[141:27.31]Did you play this, kid?
[141:28.29]I played Putt-Putt, I think, for 10 minutes.
[141:30.63]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[141:50.12]Is this on iPad?
[141:52.88]Wait, there's something shining down there.
[141:55.27]Oh, it's this guy again.
[142:05.35]Living underwater is what bugs me the most.
[142:08.62]You wake up in the morning with soggy toast.
[142:11.84]And the frying pan never really gets that hot.
[142:15.54]I can't keep the lid on my croquette pot.
[142:18.75]It's terrible.
[142:19.83]Don't ever sing again.
[142:22.45]I'll give you a thousand dollars and never do that again.
[142:38.44]I'm just kidding.
[142:39.06]Do it again, do it again, do it again.
[142:40.34]Aw, trident?
[142:40.80]Yeah, I've been chewing trident lately.
[142:42.10]It'll make my teeth a little bit better.
[143:14.83]That's a reference to when I was younger and I said that at the dentist.
[143:21.63]Do you guys even watch my stream?
[143:26.21]That's the worst joke ever.
[143:27.17]That is a direct reference to me at the dentist chair when I was like fucking 12.
[143:34.03]Remember I told you when I went to the dentist and I told the dentist that I was chewing Trident?
[143:39.63]I made it up.
[143:40.94]Do you guys even watch this stream?
[143:51.90]I gotta go down
[144:05.08]Ahoy, Captain Schnitzel.
[144:06.58]How's the submarine?
[144:07.95]Oh, not going nowhere fast.
[144:11.05]But that's okay.
[144:12.89]It gives me time to zing my zee ditties.
[144:18.77]I had a girlfriend, a 2,000 pounder.
[144:21.66]That's slim for a whale, but she was a flounder.
[144:24.34]Hey, nanny, nanny, and a hot cha-cha.
[144:26.46]Hey, nanny, nanny, and a hot cha-cha.
[144:28.54]You know what I just noticed?
[144:32.80]How come every horror movie, all the horror movie antagonists, there's always a scene.
[144:38.70]Every time, in every one of the movies.
[144:40.24]Every scary monster or scary person movie, they always do this.
[144:43.92]They go, there's a scene where it's them, and the main character's looking at them, and they go... They go like... They do the head tilt thing.
[144:55.15]Why?
[144:56.45]It's like...
[145:01.53]Why do they keep doing that?
[145:02.39]They do it in every fucking single movie.
[145:07.34]May we have that rope for our trap, Captain Schnitzel?
[145:10.02]You'll see it now.
[145:10.74]Yeah, you can take it.
[145:12.33]If you can untie it.
[145:13.97]I just ruined every horror movie you're going to watch now.
[145:16.31]Because when they show the bad guy or the monster or the thing, that's the scary thing, it does the dog head tilt.
[145:27.02]You're going to see it now because you're going to be looking for it.
[145:29.70]And you're going to say, what the fuck, you just ruined the whole movie for me.
[145:36.04]jeepers we're not having whoops wow got it you're wrong just watch it we need to pull on the end really slow and then it's like a chase scene we need to pull on the ends of the rope to untie it what are you talking about I just did it
[145:56.58]Wait, what?
[145:58.00]What's going on?
[145:59.32]What?
[146:00.04]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[146:02.68]Hold on.
[146:03.22]This is where we are now.
[146:06.27]Yay!
[146:24.22]Now we have the rope we need for our trap.
[146:26.60]We need three more things to make our ghost trap.
[146:31.28]That is literally only in Halloween.
[146:33.20]No, it is not.
[146:35.30]Look, I don't have to be right right now.
[146:37.50]I can be right like two months from now when you figure it out.
[146:39.66]I don't have to be right right now.
[146:45.90]Every time Michael Myers tilts his head.
[146:52.36]It's other movies too, it's not just Michael Myers.
[147:09.35]Everybody does it because it's a reference to Michael Myers.
[147:15.25]Whatever it is, I keep seeing it.
[147:16.89]Alright guys, we good?
[147:20.76]We're good.
[147:24.01]I made a stop-motion animation and I had my monster do that, laughing my ass off.
[147:28.48]That's what I'm saying.
[147:33.30]My favorite thing about this stream is you can leave for half an hour and Gerber will still be talking about the same thing when you get back.
[147:37.56]Huh?
[147:38.66]It's been five minutes!
[147:39.65]Look, I'm the captain!
[147:41.97]Ball speed ahead!
[147:44.63]Woof!
[147:45.15]Woof!
[147:45.95]Woof!
[147:52.85]Luther, are you okay?
[147:54.53]I'll be okay.
[147:55.63]Just feeling a little buggy right now.
[147:58.67]Luther, I think you've hit on something.
[148:01.45]Yes, unfortunately it was something very hard.
[148:05.19]No.
[148:06.67]That wheel will be perfect for a trap.
[148:09.21]Oh, I need the wheel.
[148:12.73]Luther, we'll need to find a way to loosen this bolt so we can get the wheel.
[148:18.96]Chat, I got a wrench, Chat.
[148:20.86]I got a wrench.
[148:24.75]The game is too loud?
[148:26.53]It has to be.
[148:28.91]So you can hear the voice acting.
[148:31.19]Is that oil?
[148:31.43]Pick that up.

[152:46.56]It'll fit.

[154:48.82]It's definitely this way.
[155:24.05]Where is it?

[157:49.98]Where's my mouse?
[157:53.89]Alright, last one.

[157:59.03]That was kind of fun.
[157:59.65]So where's this thing?
[158:03.79]I feel like I went a really long way to not get this thing.
[158:12.26]This way?
[158:18.30]That was kind of fun.
[158:20.40]Alright, I'm gonna go in.
[158:22.56]You should be like Club Penguin.
[158:30.13]Oh, alright.
[158:30.91]Let's go.
[158:31.45]So just get four... Just get eight shoes.
[158:50.15]That's not even a joke.
[158:51.61]Just get eight sneakers and you can run.
[158:53.81]I don't get it.
[158:56.37]That was cute.
[159:19.86]So what do you need?
[159:20.58]These are my fish.
[159:29.54]We have three.
[159:30.44]We have... It's a list.
[159:32.63]What do fish use for money?
[159:34.95]I think I know this one.
[159:36.43]Sand dollars.
[159:38.03]I thought so.
[159:42.13]These... Come on.
[159:43.81]There once was a cow guppy who'd hoop and holler.
[159:48.80]and he had a fine young seahorse by the name of Sand Dollar.
[159:53.62]He'd ride into town with his 10-gallon hat, but nobody knew his name.
[160:00.19]As a matter of fact,
[160:17.25]I don't know what I do now.
[160:26.98]Are you having a good time?
[160:29.48]I'm just kind of chilling.
[160:30.36]This is fun.
[160:30.86]I'm just chilling.
[160:46.57]The stream activated my acid reflux.
[160:48.49]I don't know.
[160:54.79]What did you eat?
[160:56.49]Hi, kids.
[160:58.03]What can I do you for?
[160:59.59]Hey, Ray.
[161:00.53]How's business?
[161:02.65]You probably heard that I am now a collector of fine new and used trophies.
[161:08.55]And I'm trading one of the specialty items.
[161:13.49]I gotta move on.
[161:15.22]I gotta play another game.
[161:16.82]I was like about to yawn.
[161:20.04]I was like... It's too chill.
[161:21.78]I'm loving it.
[161:22.88]Trophy?
[161:42.91]Where do I get a trophy?
[161:47.19]I don't have a trophy?
[161:50.85]Fuck you.
[161:53.41]Casino.
[161:55.41]That's not a casino.
[161:56.17]It's a movie theater.
[161:57.11]I think it is.
[161:58.83]Okay, um... Should we go to the movies?
[162:02.72]Flashing lights?
[162:08.36]Or a casino in my brain.
[162:10.16]Alright, let's go to the movies.
[162:11.46]Alright, let's see.
[162:13.91]Yes, I'm actually now.
[162:15.35]I'm excited again.
[162:18.03]We get to watch movies.
[162:19.33]I love going to the theater.
[162:30.46]Freddy, do I like the next movie?
[162:32.98]Yeah.
[162:35.08]Alright.
[162:39.84]Codzilla?
[162:42.40]Action figure guy.
[162:43.95]Roma.
[162:45.13]Worm doodles.
[162:46.65]Sheriff.
[162:49.53]Uh... Goblin?
[162:51.59]Dracula?
[162:53.09]Fish with thing on his nose.
[162:54.77]Bug movie.
[162:57.43]Let's go.
[163:03.57]This is awful.
[163:16.24]Alright, how about Lightning?
[163:18.68]How about Gatorade, the movie?
[163:22.02]How have they not done that yet, by the way?
[163:26.34]That one was bad too.
[163:52.26]that's two thumbs up that's two thumbs up for me
[164:29.67]Oh my god.
[164:31.22]Alright, that was funny.
[164:33.80]Alright, yeah, that one gets one thumbs up.
[164:44.11]This is another, this is another, this is a game.
[164:59.50]It's Canadian?
[165:13.11]Alright.
[165:19.16]These are just TikToks.
[165:54.86]That was the whole movie.
[165:57.24]That was the entire movie.
[166:04.70]This is a scary movie.
[166:05.96]I wonder if the character goes like this.
[166:10.21]Curse of the Sardine.
[166:11.75]Let's go.
[166:29.61]Conchilla.
[166:33.28]Okay, that was the title.
[166:41.57]Coming to a theater.
[166:42.35]Oh, these are trailers.
[166:43.93]Godfish Commando.
[167:15.87]That was dumb.
[167:16.45]Alright, worm doodles.
[167:19.59]You gotta have them.
[167:21.27]Mmm, mmm, worm doodles.
[167:24.33]Squishy, squashy worm doodles in all your favorite flavors.
[167:28.53]Original, chocolate, sea cucumber, lemon, orange, red.
[167:33.86]Is this Justin Roiland?
[167:34.98]Grab them, because you gotta have them.
[167:43.84]This reminds me of a Justin Roiland skit.
[167:46.83]Red.
[168:17.21]Sheriff Gill!
[168:18.35]Alright, this is... Count... Count... Well, I couldn't even read that.
[168:26.17]I like the sound effects.
[168:55.17]Luther, if we spend too long in here, we'll never trap that ghost.
[169:00.57]Freddy, do you think they'll play the movie with that fish I like?
[169:03.81]I don't know, Luther.
[169:08.21]That person just ate a whole turkey.
[169:11.29]Holy shit.
[169:25.54]How much food does this guy have?
[169:27.58]Yeah.
[169:29.50]Yeah.
[170:01.67]I have to get out of here.
[170:03.03]I have to leave now.
[170:03.93]I just couldn't get out.
[170:07.75]Alright, what about the pulley?
[170:09.99]Pulley emporium.
[170:15.31]Break it, you buy it.
[170:16.05]It's a big sale today.
[170:20.03]There we go.
[170:20.41]Okay.
[170:27.36]I'll bet there's a neat story behind that pulley A pirate fish had this pulley and would not give it away Until I won it fair and square in a game of underwater croquet How much is it?
[170:45.31]That looks like an interesting pulley
[170:49.62]How much does it cost?
[170:52.30]How much does it cost?
[170:54.56]What do I need to give you?
[170:56.44]How do I get one?
[170:57.52]I'm just gonna take it.
[171:24.14]That was cool.
[171:25.32]I'll bet there's a neat story behind that pulley.
[171:27.86]They're not for sale.
[171:28.74]It says big sail on it.
[171:29.94]It says big sail.
[171:30.58]This pulley comes down to the sea, my friends.
[171:32.75]To the lonely sea from the sky.
[171:35.09]From the port bow of a tall ship that sailed from Paraguay.
[171:39.63]Okay.
[171:41.51]Big sail.
[171:43.37]Great stories abound in your pulley emporium.
[171:46.65]Just point to a pulley and I'll tell you some more of them.
[171:55.25]This business is a fucking flop, man.
[171:57.05]I'm sorry.

[172:09.32]Look at... I don't need these anymore?
[172:10.70]What'd you do that for?
[172:27.32]King Crab donated his pearls to build this hall of fame.
[172:31.42]Trophy!
[172:32.76]Tina Tuna held her breath above water for 13 minutes.
[172:39.18]Sergy Sturgeon won four gold medals in the all-ocean powerlifting competition.
[172:45.30]Cool.
[172:46.00]Alright, give me the trophy.
[172:46.88]That's the trophy I won for the deep-sea spelling bee.

[172:53.15]Darn!
[172:56.48]The trophy case is locked.
[173:00.12]So open it.
[173:01.56]I wonder who we could get the combination from.
[173:04.11]Oh, come on.
[173:04.75]Hey, I think this fell off the back of the lock.
[173:09.39]From the, the kid with the glasses?
[173:10.75]It says, to get the combination to this lock, show this card to Mr. Triple Finn.
[173:18.17]Who?
[173:18.83]Who's Mr. Triple Finn?
[173:19.73]I don't know who that is.
[173:20.99]Who's that?
[173:21.35]It's the guy with the guitar?
[173:24.03]I gotta go all the way back there?

[178:49.23]We can make the trap.
[178:50.11]A pornography critique stream would be hilarious.

[179:02.46]I... I go away.
[179:18.60]Alright, I got everything.

[180:21.80]Are we trying to kill this guy?
[180:24.64]That's just about everything.
[180:27.68]Luther, can we use your toy as bait?
[180:31.31]Well, okay.
[180:35.57]Our trap is complete.
[180:37.93]Someone's coming.
[180:39.75]Hey, boss.
[180:43.51]Look, a toy.
[180:45.97]Let's grab it.
[180:47.23]It's these two.
[181:06.75]Whoa, we got him!
[181:10.97]We got him!
[181:12.89]It's the two sharks!
[181:16.37]What the fuck?
[181:16.95]It's the two sharks!
[181:21.47]What?
[181:22.63]Whoa.
[181:35.27]You should know that you can't just take things that belong to someone else.
[181:40.73]Uh, you know, she just might have a point there, boys.
[181:45.62]Okay, you can give back the toys.
[181:49.08]The squid father doesn't need the toys as much as the goblin.
[181:52.04]These kind of hold up.
[181:52.78]They still do.
[181:53.28]Here, give this to the squid father.
[181:55.39]He should have at least one toy.
[181:58.89]Where we're giving the toy where... Isn't this just enabling that bad behavior?
[182:06.76]Isn't the whole point of this that they were sending the bad guys to go steal the toy and we just gave the toy to them?
[182:12.77]At the end?
[182:15.75]The message is to share.
[182:18.27]Okay, I understand the message is to share, but they're trying to kill us!
[182:47.28]selfish these guys are dressing up in a costume talking about how they were going to get us and and trying to like come and scare the kids and I'm missing out on clicking stuff how dare you guys say that to me
[183:14.15]I can't... somebody said the moral of the story is to... I can't even fucking breathe.
[183:22.14]The moral of the story is to stomp the bad guy's teeth into their brains.
[183:33.27]No, that's not what I said either, by the way.
[183:36.31]That's not what I said.
[183:42.91]That is not what I said either.
[183:44.13]The moral of the story is... fucking consumerism.
[183:47.42]Stop clicking?
[183:47.98]That's what you do in this game.
[184:14.00]Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[184:15.00]Fucking consumers.
[184:23.63]What's in that?
[184:24.13]Oh, magical gold!
[184:28.03]Now, the moral of the story is I want all the toys for myself.
[184:37.30]Everybody coming over here with a toy, it's not mine.
[184:42.61]Give me that toy.
[184:43.31]What is it?
[184:43.67]I want it.
[184:45.45]Give me that skull.
[184:46.05]Give me that one.
[184:47.73]The whole thing.
[184:53.77]Give me that.
[184:55.21]Pop that.
[184:55.53]I don't want anyone to play with me.
[184:56.72]Pop it.
[184:58.96]What's this?
[184:59.36]It's cheap shit.
[185:02.14]Get it out of here.
[185:06.06]Do that again.
[185:19.87]Okay, I'm done.
[185:21.05]Do you want to start the game all over?
[185:23.84]No.
[185:25.20]That was fun.
[185:25.56]That was Freddy Fish 2.
[185:26.68]The curse of the mean antagonists that continue to cause a problem.
[185:35.99]In Freddy Fish 3, they'll be stealing the fucking pie off the sill.
[185:40.43]See you next time.
[185:43.63]We're going to play the other game.
[185:44.37]That was fun.
[185:45.73]Actually, I liked it.
[185:50.03]legendary boring stream you almost just got me to hiss into the camera which would change your mind but no I'm just hanging out playing kids games what's the matter I was gonna I was gonna hiss at you remember you're 36.
[186:18.85]Alright, you guys ready?
[186:19.41]We're going to move on.
[186:20.77]We are going to play Unpacking.
[186:24.58]It's a game where I have to, I think, decorate a room.
[186:27.10]I'm looking very much forward to it.
[186:28.88]It's going to be such a chill, relaxing stream.
[186:31.71]I recommend you have it in another tab and maybe just sit back, relax, maybe have a little bit of a snack.
[186:36.85]We'll go for it.
[186:37.39]Let's go.
