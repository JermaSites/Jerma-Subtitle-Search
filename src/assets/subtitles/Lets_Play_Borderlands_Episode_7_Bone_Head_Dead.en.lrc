[03:58.53]I got it.
[04:00.29]A bunch of money, too.
[04:01.99]Look at that.
[04:02.77]All that money for me.
[04:05.01]None for you.
[04:06.83]There's more in here.
[04:08.59]There has to be.
[04:11.28]In there.
[04:11.90]Oh yeah, in the toilet.
[04:13.34]In the toilet.
[04:14.16]I was going to say, did I just swipe up all the cash?
[04:18.32]What was that?
[04:19.06]Who's just screaming at us?
[04:19.90]That was me.
[04:22.89]I did my super sexy scream.
[04:24.17]What's wrong with you?
[04:27.89]Oh, alright.
[04:29.35]So now, we get to turn this in.

[04:35.19]Mine.
[04:35.55]I saw it first.
[04:35.97]My cash.
[04:36.93]Oh, I got it.
[04:38.63]My finger's quicker than yours, apparently.
[04:42.12]for picking up money on the ground.
[04:44.30]Hey, hey, hey, watch this.
[04:46.88]Sucker.
[04:48.34]Yeah, you can run, but you can't hide.
[04:51.42]Hey, you know what's really funny?
[04:53.81]I guess you can, uh, you can duel.
[04:55.51]You can, like, do PvP in this game.
[04:57.55]Really?
[04:58.11]So we'll definitely have to, you know, eventually figure that out and mess around with that.
[05:02.25]I jump over a piss-washed gully.
[05:05.64]And open the bandit's gate.
[05:07.94]Alright, I can do that.
[05:11.12]Let me just compare my stuff that I have in here.
[05:14.96]This thing with the violent SMG.
[05:17.14]Everything goes down.
[05:18.40]All the stats are up.
[05:19.86]Wow.
[05:21.62]The zoom is nice.
[05:23.78]This thing, look, can you see when I shoot it that some shit comes out?
[05:28.52]Do it again.
[05:28.92]Oh yeah, it's like blue plasma.
[05:33.75]Yeah.

[05:49.13]Maybe he's getting, like, overrun.
[05:50.85]Oh, no, no, no.
[05:52.79]There's bad guys coming out of here.

[10:00.89]Yeah.
[10:01.59]How much money do we have?
[10:02.44]7,000, I think.
[10:06.00]6,000.
[10:06.60]Really?
[10:07.34]It says I have 6,000.
[10:09.44]I have 335.
[10:10.88]So maybe, yeah, we definitely don't share money then.
[10:13.38]Oh, I got a light healing kit.
[10:18.45]Alright, I got plenty of ammo, so I'm not worried about that.
[10:23.21]Alright, um... There's a sniper rifle over here.
[10:25.91]There's a lot of skags over there, so watch yourself.
[10:29.22]Yeah, it's junk.
[10:30.60]This one's much better.
[10:31.34]Where are they?
[10:33.46]They're in the gully that you just jumped in.
[10:37.12]Elder Skagg.
[10:39.89]That guy's fast.
[10:43.75]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, combo.
[10:46.25]Combo.
[10:47.13]Go, bird.
[10:50.17]Ow.
[10:55.86]Oh, you bastard.
[10:56.82]Whoa.
[10:58.33]That was painful.
[11:01.65]That was very painful.
[11:03.59]Watch out behind you.
[11:04.42]Badass fire skag.
[11:06.14]Oh my god.
[11:07.14]Watch it.
[11:08.64]Throwing grenades over there.
[11:11.08]Oh god.
[11:12.22]Oh my god.
[11:14.98]This guy's gotta get away from me.
[11:16.86]Okay.
[11:18.10]Shit, he's called a badass fire skag.
[11:21.57]See, he's still alive.
[11:23.11]Come on.
[11:23.65]No, no, no, no!
[11:24.73]Don't kill me!
[11:26.96]Oh god, this is bad.
[11:29.64]I'm about to go down.
[11:31.18]I'm going down.
[11:32.04]No!
[11:32.54]I died too.
[11:35.00]Unless I can kill one of these guys.
[11:37.04]Maybe.
[11:37.42]Just maybe.
[11:38.78]I think I might be able to be OK.
[11:42.18]And the verdict of that is... I'm back.
[11:45.38]Alright.
[11:46.24]I weakened the elder stag for you.
[11:47.84]Nope.
[11:48.12]I'm dead again.
[11:49.62]Instantly after getting up.
[11:53.86]You can get up.
[11:54.42]That would be ideal.
[11:59.09]I'm about to be going down in about three seconds.
[12:02.04]Three, two, one.
[12:03.94]I'm out.
[12:04.70]I'm dead.
[12:05.98]You'll be back here in a sec.
[12:07.84]Ready?
[12:09.24]There we go.
[12:12.63]Oh, it costs a ton of money.
[12:20.33]Any assistance will be appreciated.
[12:21.91]Yeah, I'm out of ammo.
[12:22.79]I need to switch guns.
[12:28.35]Go bird!
[12:29.19]Oh god, I'm running.
[12:36.20]Yeah, go for the Elder Skag first.
[12:37.54]Just get him down.
[12:40.30]Alright, now we just have to... I just killed him!
[12:43.76]Nice.
[12:45.46]Now we just have to... Big dude!
[12:46.44]I'm about to be down.
[12:47.28]I'm trying to get him to come after me.
[12:52.60]Let me see if the reload sequence stays over the time.
[12:56.50]Here, where is he?
[12:57.02]Is he still there?
[12:57.74]Yep, he's still here.
[12:59.30]I'm just pumping him full of rounds.
[13:04.35]He's about to die.
[13:12.09]Die already!
[13:12.85]There we go.
[13:15.81]Well, that wasn't easy.
[13:18.95]We lost a bunch of money, too.
[13:22.18]More people.
[13:24.89]God, these skag whelps are, like, much stronger.
[13:31.11]Yeah, there was a couple there.
[13:32.75]One or two hit, killing me.
[13:33.97]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[13:36.17]Oh, jeez.
[13:36.43]There's another one.
[13:52.23]Oh my god, die.
[13:53.45]I got him, I got him for you.
[13:57.64]Nice.
[13:58.02]Alright, can we have like thirty seconds to pick this stuff up on the ground?
[14:06.34]That would be useful.
[14:09.84]Shotgun shells, shotgun shells, shotgun shells.
[14:13.47]That completely missed.
[14:14.67]I had like hundreds of rounds in both of my guns.
[14:18.25]Now I got like ten.
[14:22.62]Yeah, same.
[14:28.39]Oh, more guys.
[14:33.15]Put the ammo.
[14:46.21]Go for the skag on the far.
[14:48.39]Wait, let me get the kill on him.
[14:55.71]I'm trying to get his mouth, but it's open.
[14:57.11]Anyone need help?
[14:59.25]Oh, you son of a bitch.
[15:00.19]How am I crouching?
