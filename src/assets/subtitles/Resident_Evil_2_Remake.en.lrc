[00:01.83]Good afternoon.
[00:04.58]Welcome to class.
[00:06.70]I'm your teacher.
[00:10.04]Sternma.
[00:11.20]I'm stern today.
[00:12.32]I got bubble gum.
[00:14.98]Get the fuck out of here.
[00:18.10]I can smell it.
[00:18.64]Hi, guys.
[00:20.28]Uh-oh, internet.
[00:23.80]Uh-oh.
[00:25.28]Uh-oh.
[00:32.28]Kind of going with a theme here.
[00:35.02]Starting streams and having them... Have cocks problems.
[00:41.85]But, Resident Evil 2 tonight.
[00:44.07]Looking forward to it a lot.
[00:46.75]I played the original a long time ago.
[00:51.39]And... Fuckin'... Are we gonna turn off?
[00:56.03]Is this stream gonna stay connected to the internet?
[00:59.37]What the fuck?
[01:01.41]I'm not even going to tweet this out yet.
[01:02.67]This is... Come on.
[01:06.83]They're just playing with me here.
[01:07.83]It's not actually going to happen.
[01:12.87]I've been looking forward to it.
[01:14.66]Jerm of Pluto.
[01:23.00]Yeah, you moved to avoid this?
[01:24.60]Well, here's the problem.
[01:25.74]I live in North America.
[01:29.38]It's a problem everywhere.
[01:38.40]So, unfortunately.
[01:46.51]I think it's gonna be fine.
[01:49.15]I'm gonna do a prediction here.
[01:50.07]In about five minutes, it's like it's not even... It's like it never happened.
[01:54.47]Alright?
[01:59.98]Just take a balloon to Europe.
[02:01.60]You know, I might as well.
[02:05.52]Alright, quick.
[02:06.02]What's the best state in Europe?
[02:21.57]Somebody said Norway?
[02:23.47]Norway.
[02:23.73]I've seen a lot of Norways.
[02:26.23]London?
[02:27.83]But... Isn't that not even... Alright, give me a second.
[02:38.76]I'm gonna go just... I'm not going anywhere.
[02:41.96]I'm actually... I'm just gonna like sit here like this.
[02:43.74]Let's turn the camera on just to... As well, right?
[02:47.24]But hold on.
[02:47.88]Let me make sure that there's no like... I'm not like naked in this one.
[02:54.55]Okay.
[02:54.83]I should be clothed.
[03:01.91]I am.
[03:02.25]Okay, hold on.
[03:04.05]Hmm.
[03:26.54]Okay, well, uh, hi everybody.
[03:28.86]Welcome to the spring.
[03:30.86]This is, uh, this is the portion of the spring where we sometimes just have to wait until I'm allowed to have my internet work.
[03:40.77]And... How was your Monday?
[03:43.45]Mine was pretty good.
[03:44.87]My hair slicked back with oil.
[03:48.27]I went like this, I just stuck my hands into, like, jelly.
[03:53.17]I just went like this, and I smeared it back over my fucking head.
[03:58.45]I had to look okay today, because the facecam might come on at random jumpscare moments.
[04:10.11]2,000 drop frames.
[04:20.57]Don't do it to us again.
[04:29.49]Turn off the lights?
[04:31.51]It's the middle of the daytime, though.
[04:32.79]I can't just turn the lights off.
[04:37.07]That's too much.
[04:37.93]That's too much for my brain.
[04:38.63]I cannot sit in a dark room when it's light outside.
[04:44.39]Do it.
[04:45.15]No.
[04:45.53]It's daytime.
[04:47.01]You're going to fuck with my cerebral.
[04:58.11]It's not even going to do anything.
[04:58.90]There's light coming through the window over here.
[05:05.06]My camera just auto-adjusted.
[05:07.40]Because this light didn't do anything.
[05:14.39]You think this is going to be scary?
[05:16.99]No.
[05:23.74]Boomer Cerebral can't handle the dark.
[05:26.74]No, the boomer's cerebral can't handle the red indicator that keeps popping up on my OBS.
[05:38.84]The next time I get internet, I'm going to ask a very specific question.
[05:43.30]I'm going to ask, can I reach the moon in less than a tenth of a second?
[05:50.14]And will it come back to me from the moon in less than tenth of a second?
[05:56.20]If the answer is no, I'm going to tell them to fuck off.
[06:12.85]Rude?
[06:14.27]I'll tell you what's rude.
[06:15.23]You wanna know what's rude?
[06:19.80]Charging fucking hundreds of dollars a month for a service
[06:24.31]that only wants to work like fucking 48% of the time.
[06:28.51]That's pretty rude.
[06:29.59]That's real rude, actually.
[06:30.90]It might even be goddamn illegal.
[06:32.98]It's not.
[06:39.02]That's rude.
[06:44.40]That's rude.
[06:46.50]But it'll fix itself, don't worry.
[06:49.40]Let me turn this back on now.
[06:51.76]That looks so much worse.
[06:54.84]That looks terrible.
[06:55.72]I don't like how that looks.
[06:59.36]In fact, let me move this.
[07:02.78]Where... Because I'm going to be looking this way, right?
[07:08.96]So it needs to be over here.
[07:15.89]That's way too far.
[07:18.79]No, it's not.
[07:19.11]That's good.
[07:20.43]Because I'm going to be looking this way, right?
[07:27.01]Do I have to use the vlogger angle?
[07:28.54]I don't even know what that means.
[07:36.48]No, this is the one time like a year you're going to get a face cam.
[07:39.30]So, let's do it.
[07:41.26]Alright, I might as well just go.
[07:43.97]Unless something really, really bad happens here, which I don't know if it will.
[07:47.13]It might.
[07:49.91]What the fuck am I going to do, you know?
[07:51.85]What am I going to do?
[07:53.99]Nothing.
[07:56.22]So, uh, let me just make sure, let's, hold on, is this lined up correctly?
[08:06.50]Kind of is.
[08:06.96]Let me just get it over here.
[08:09.28]Uh-huh.
[08:19.23]Don't be mad already.
[08:20.49]Uh, I don't know if mad's the right word.
[08:23.33]I think just disappointed is the right word.
[08:30.62]I think the word is disappointed.
[08:40.74]Uh, but yeah, uh, what are we at?
[08:43.12]10% of every frame drop.
[08:44.02]That's just fantastic.
[08:45.96]What a great $400 a month service.
[08:51.23]$400 a month.
[08:53.75]Did you hear what I just said?
[08:55.29]That's a, that's reality.
[09:02.85]Yeah.
[09:03.61]You just heard me say that.
[09:04.47]That's Cox business.
[09:06.91]Works great, doesn't it?
[09:08.61]No, it doesn't.
[09:09.25]Not at all.
[09:19.04]Anyways.
[09:25.12]Complain on Twitter?
[09:25.92]No, here's what happens when you complain on Twitter, guys.
[09:28.59]They have, like, people that automatically just watch...
[09:32.23]It doesn't matter if it's Comcast, Cox, Disney Quest, whatever internet you have.
[09:37.61]It doesn't matter.
[09:38.65]There are people that just scope through and try to find people putting hashtags of like, hashtag Cox sucks, Comcast sucks.
[09:47.02]And these support agents just go, hey, what happened?
[09:49.60]Are you okay?
[09:51.08]And then you reply to them.
[09:53.60]And they are like not even like the base level of technician.
[09:58.24]They're like, they like get you in contact with like a base level technician.
[10:03.42]They're just there to try to get you to shut up on Twitter.
[10:06.88]It's stupid.
[10:07.84]And there are a lot of people that thought that I went, I still have Comcast.
[10:25.39]No.
[10:27.77]I went from... This is a completely different company.
[10:30.39]This is a new ISP in a new state.
[10:32.79]It doesn't matter.
[10:50.10]It's gonna be fine.
[10:50.98]It will fix itself.
[10:52.01]It will.
[10:52.35]It just... For dumb, stupid, random reasons...
[10:59.53]It'll just go to like 20% of what we pay for for like two hours, three hours in a row.
[11:18.24]He's stealing Wi-Fi from McDonald's.
[11:20.80]You know what?
[11:21.22]It would probably be better.
[11:23.96]Why can't McDonald's make their own internet?
[11:27.24]Think about this, for real, I want you to think about this, because people are going to be like, what are you talking about?
[11:31.68]McDonald's has some of the fastest service.
[11:35.48]Ever.
[11:37.24]You pull up to the window.
[11:39.64]You order, like, a bunch of food.
[11:42.82]And this shit is at the window ten seconds later.
[11:46.54]I bet you McDonald's could get a burger to the moon and back in less than fucking five seconds, if they really wanted to.
[11:53.72]I would love to pay for a McDonald's internet service.
[12:01.77]Yeah, because they made it hours ago.
[12:04.20]So?
[12:07.58]So what?
[12:10.31]They could make the internet hours ago.
[12:12.31]They could just get the data package and like get it in a fucking box and get it ready and then send it out to customers.
[12:19.29]Oh, you're over here now.
[12:20.05]Hi.
[12:20.77]Hi, everybody.
[12:21.27]My name's Jeremy, and this is called Let's Wait Out the Internet.
[12:24.33]It's a fun game we play.
[12:25.61]I've been playing it since, like, 2016.
[12:28.71]It's very fun.
[12:29.41]It's an interesting thing.
[12:31.07]Resident Evil 2 sounds like a fun game to play.
[12:39.34]It will fix it.
[12:40.08]It's going to fix itself.
[12:41.64]I know it will.
[12:44.78]Fucking Internet.
[12:49.36]Gonna have to, gonna have to fucking... Are we gonna just silently be angry here until this is, like, working?
[13:10.25]I might have to just sit here.
[13:12.04]We're gonna have to go fullscreen then.
[13:16.70]Get this off.
[13:18.34]Look, it's ready.
[13:19.10]It's right here.
[13:19.64]The truck is there.
[13:21.16]I'm in the goddamn truck.
[13:22.78]I'm ready to go.
[13:23.82]And it's stalled out.
[13:25.08]Look at that.
[13:27.24]Oh, no.
[13:28.86]Sorry, there's pedestrians crossing.
[13:30.91]Can't really go anywhere.
[13:32.61]Sorry, Claire.
[13:33.43]I can't go anywhere.
[13:35.23]Yeah.
[13:37.49]This is the internet data is going across.
[13:39.59]It's like a bunch of ducks.
[13:40.53]There's like 7,000 of them.
[13:41.55]We've got to wait here for like four hours.
[13:57.14]Well, let's go ahead and just do this.
[14:00.92]Let's figure out what the hell I'm going to even do when I'm allowed to do anything.
[14:05.70]So we got Leon or Claire.
[14:07.44]I was going to go Leon because Leon is from the original game.
[14:11.94]Claire's from the original game too, but don't you start with Leon from the original game, right?
[14:21.53]From my understanding, this is two completely different paths, right?
[14:28.63]It's two completely different campaigns.
[14:31.22]So, that's okay.
[14:35.28]Do a smart click.
[14:36.00]I was going to play Leon.
[14:38.22]I'm a huge fan of Resident Evil 4, and this is the sequel to Resident Evil 4, backwards.
[14:42.57]So, you know.
[14:55.15]Maybe if I just, like, go to the options menu for a while.
[14:57.30]Maybe you guys... Wait, look, look, look.
[14:58.40]You guys are gonna make fun of my graphic settings for, like, ten minutes.
[15:01.20]And then we'll be able to do it.
[15:05.20]I'm gonna go like that.
[15:07.32]This... Let me just make... Hold on.
[15:10.26]I need to, like, just triple check something here.
[15:13.16]I'm gonna back out of this for a minute.
[15:18.13]How do I exit the game?
[15:22.60]How do you exit Resident Evil 2?
[15:28.69]Is there no exit?
[15:29.89]How do you exit?
[15:40.05]Because I need to exit to look at something, and I can't alt tab either.
[15:47.64]How do I get out of here?
[15:51.90]Well, I was going to play Leon.
[15:55.16]Assisted.
[15:56.05]Standard or hardcore?
[15:59.13]Assisted.
[15:59.73]For players who are unfamiliar, aim assist, recover a certain amount of health automatically, and enemies are weaker.
[16:04.17]I can't do that, though.
[16:04.99]Normal.
[16:06.73]Hardcore.
[16:09.15]Saving requires an ink ribbon, no auto-save, and... I don't care.
[16:14.95]I don't care about the difficulty of the game.
[16:17.25]It's the saving that I... No.
[16:18.92]We're not doing that.
[16:20.52]That looks absolutely delicious, holy shit.
[16:34.70]Is that a triple?
[16:35.82]Is that a quadruple?
[16:39.75]One, two.
[16:40.47]How many patties are in there?
[16:41.65]That's at least two or three patties.
[16:43.71]He's eating the wrapper, too, I think.
[16:45.15]That's what you do.
[16:45.73]You can't eat and drive.
[16:46.87]You might accidentally eat the wrapper.
[16:48.71]It's happened to me a couple times.
[17:05.56]And I'm in the passenger seat, by the way.
[17:07.18]He's gonna crash into something.
[17:09.88]What?
[17:10.32]No, no, not good.
[17:42.76]I think for a second I thought he just flew out of the car.
[17:44.60]I was like, hold on, what happened?
[18:00.69]Truck driver with a truck driver hat on.
[18:05.20]There's a truck on that hat, isn't there?
[18:15.47]Just in case you were wondering what he did for a living.
[18:27.13]What's the thing about Leon?
[18:28.61]It's Leon's birthday today, right?
[18:30.18]It's like his 18th birthday.
[18:31.42]It's his first day on the 18th birthday.
[18:36.53]There he is.
[18:55.36]Turn up the game?
[18:55.92]I will.
[18:56.20]I just have no control over the game right now.
[18:57.90]Don't worry.
[19:01.64]Cohen's around.
[19:08.86]That's weird.
[19:15.06]We are open.
[19:15.88]Let's go.
[19:26.68]Alright.
[19:27.22]So.
[19:28.34]Let me explore your surroundings.
[19:32.24]Not yet.
[19:32.62]Because I need to turn this up.
[19:38.95]How bad is it?
[19:39.61]Is the internet still fucking bad?
[19:41.13]Are we still having problems here?
[19:50.29]Stop dropping frames?
[19:51.45]I wish I could stop it.
[19:55.75]You know, I do have to turn the lights off.
[19:57.03]It doesn't make any sense like this.
[20:06.84]It's a little better, right?
[20:08.62]No.
[20:09.00]I'm like so out of place here.
[20:11.10]Okay.
[20:23.79]There we go.
[20:24.23]Let's bring this down.
[20:28.96]Now it looks like I actually belong in here.
[20:36.29]It's like darker.
[20:37.37]It's a little scarier, right?
[20:44.63]I can already see people making fun of my sideburn.
[20:46.92]I can see it.
[20:47.40]I don't even have to look at it in chat.
[20:49.26]I already know you're doing it.
[20:51.98]Alright.
[20:53.74]Pray that we get our internet back, but I'm just going to go.
[20:56.30]What can I do, right?
[20:57.84]Okay, here we go.
[20:58.42]Explore surroundings.
[21:03.97]Speaking of brightness, this monitor is too bright.
[21:10.05]How do I turn the brightness down on this?
[21:12.89]Oh, I can just turn... We can just turn it off.
[21:19.55]But then I can't see chat.
[21:27.45]Hold on, I got it.
[21:33.07]Oh, you piece of shit.
[21:36.60]There we go.
[21:41.95]Alright, that's better.
[21:44.59]And yeah, I'm gonna do whatever I can to stall.
[21:46.93]Because... Like, fuck this internet.
[21:51.93]Alright.
[21:52.56]Explore surrounding.
[21:53.26]Now I can actually fucking breathe.
[21:55.80]Alright, we got a fire extinguisher.
[21:59.18]We got a gas pump.
[22:02.40]Explore... Let's go take a look at the highway.
[22:08.01]I'm just gonna walk home.
[22:12.95]Beautiful game, though.
[22:25.84]It says explore your surroundings, it didn't say how far.
[22:27.74]Nothing out here.
[22:28.90]Okay, see?
[22:29.50]I wanna make sure I know exactly what's going on.
[22:32.98]Uh, and we have an anonymous five gifted subs.
[22:37.30]Thank you.
[22:38.25]From anonymous.
[22:40.77]I gotta check the other way too.
[22:41.96]There might be mutants out there.
[22:43.42]Hold on.
[22:44.60]I see an item in the distance.
[22:45.70]That is a twinkling item on the ground over there.
[22:48.34]And half of you guys didn't even do that.
[22:50.94]See it all the way down there?
[22:51.94]You see the red?
[22:52.48]The orange and red?
[22:53.37]I'm gonna pick it up.
[22:58.73]It's gonna be an Easter egg.
[23:00.25]And then I'm gonna be on the front page of every fucking subreddit.
[23:12.06]Nevermind.
[23:15.69]I have to find a way to stall.
[23:18.05]Because this is 7,000 drop frames, guys.
[23:21.57]I've been looking forward to this game for like fucking 30 years.
[23:24.19]And you want me to do it with like 20% drop frames?
[23:37.62]Okay, here's the cop car.
[23:41.52]I'm just, we're just gonna go in.
[23:46.58]This hamburger's in here, this is where the guy got the hamburger.
[23:48.63]Okay, let's just open the door.
[23:50.41]But wait, this is important.
[23:51.93]Is this the part?
[23:55.79]I didn't even get to say my piece.
[24:01.54]How infuriating. 4.58.
[24:13.07]I just heard something.
[24:19.62]Up in the ceiling?
[24:21.94]There's a guy crawling around in, like, the vent right now.
[24:23.82]Alright, let's take a look around.
[24:30.43]Catch up.
[24:30.83]Now that's, alright, that's Heinz57's sauce.
[24:34.85]It's gross, but after you eat it for more than, like, a couple minutes, like, four or five french fries in, you forget how gross it is, and you start thinking it's actually kind of good.
[24:43.18]Am I gonna bite in the neck?
[24:50.42]He's gonna get me from behind, isn't he?
[25:18.06]Stop moving.
[25:18.98]Officer, you need help?
[25:20.32]Stay back, sir.
[25:20.92]I got this.
[25:22.04]Never take your eyes.
[25:25.95]Wait now.
[25:27.33]Help me.
[25:32.39]Oh, my God.
[25:33.19]That's fucking so horrible looking.
[25:35.99]Jesus.
[25:37.91]Freeze.
[25:39.13]I'll shoot.
[25:42.15]What the...
[25:49.42]That was... That was so ridiculous.
[25:52.12]That was every tendon.
[25:53.14]That was joints in there.
[25:56.61]Fluid.
[25:57.01]That was horrible.
[25:58.21]Showing off their new engine, huh?
[26:01.23]Alright, here's a key.
[26:05.09]Key.
[26:05.50]There's the inventory.
[26:06.34]Put it in here.
[26:07.12]So you hold items and weapons, right?
[26:09.90]Okay.
[26:11.50]I'm fine.
[26:12.08]Escape from the store.
[26:18.64]I might have to adjust the sensitivity on the... Okay, I thought the shadow was a person.
[26:24.68]God damn it!
[26:25.36]Where is he?
[26:26.00]Oh, fuck.
[26:26.74]No way.
[26:28.38]This can't be.
[26:34.52]How... I... Don't even shoot him, right?
[26:36.30]I gotta set... Resident Evil 2 is all about conserving ammo.
[26:43.05]I've already used, like, 30 bullets.
[26:52.17]Come on, there's got to be like 30 bullets in here.
[26:56.87]This door... The guy's going to get up.
[26:58.45]And he's going to fucking burst through the door.
[27:01.31]Hold on.
[27:06.17]Let's just go through there.
[27:12.96]When you need to use an item to unlock a door or solve a puzzle, select the item and then use the use command.
[27:19.30]Would make sense, wouldn't it?
[27:24.76]He's gonna die in the store.
[27:26.34]Why would I die in the store?
[27:28.42]Jesus.
[27:34.34]Oh, shit.
[27:35.02]No, no, no, no.
[27:35.60]How do I... What's the run command?
[27:37.43]What's the run command?
[27:39.17]What's the run command?
[27:44.81]I'm not... I... It is clear.
[27:51.30]Don't shoot!
[27:52.24]Get down!
[27:54.62]That doesn't count for bullets from me, right?
[28:02.42]Pretty good gamer reactions.
[28:03.82]Hey, thanks.
[28:04.46]Where did they come from?
[28:05.68]You didn't kill those guys?
[28:06.84]You're terrible.
[28:24.39]Idiot.
[28:27.03]I killed those guys in my place.
[28:28.51]Hold on.
[28:30.08]Alright, we made it out.
[28:42.35]I win.
[28:42.95]I win.
[28:43.49]I win.
[28:45.90]What the hell is going on?
[28:46.56]I don't know.
[28:48.36]Hopefully they'll have some answers at the police station.
[28:51.28]Huge bits from Great Canadian.
[28:53.09]Yeah, Leon Kennedy.
[28:55.01]You are?
[28:56.07]Claire.
[28:57.35]Claire Redfield.
[28:58.63]I'm Chris Redfield's daughter, right?
[29:00.65]Whatever it is.
[29:02.19]No.
[29:03.20]Thank you, Great Canadian, for the $50.
[29:06.62]Well, it's a good thing we found each other.
[29:08.44]I don't know what to expect anymore.
[29:12.57]Twitch let me resub for free for some reason, so this will cover it, I hope.
[29:16.69]I'll cover it like 50 times.
[29:20.67]Thank you so much, Great Canadian.
[29:24.63]Capcom.
[29:25.28]This is a Capcom game.
[29:26.62]Capcom really just killing it lately.
[29:39.96]What is this?
[29:45.51]just sitting on the desk.
[29:59.81]Is it watchable?
[30:01.67]Are we alright?
[30:03.09]Because I'm still looking over and I'm seeing the red indicator that's like, stop streaming, Jeremy.
[30:13.15]Okay.
[30:15.72]Resident Evil 2.
[30:18.02]So here's my piece I was going to say earlier that I'm really excited for this game.
[30:20.83]Not because of the game.
[30:22.53]I'm trying to talk.
[30:23.15]Oh my god, this is so unreal.
[30:25.07]Police station's not much farther.
[30:28.07]They'll know something.
[30:45.39]Yeah, but what if we're the only ones?
[30:48.23]What if there's no survivors?
[30:49.11]No, there's survivors.
[30:51.55]It's a big city.
[30:52.43]I mean, technically the zombies are survivors, right?
[30:56.06]They're not completely dead.
[30:57.70]They've survived somehow.
[31:10.40]Looks like we're walking from here.
[31:13.76]They're not dead.
[31:14.14]They still have brain activity, guys.
[31:15.48]You're not dead.
[31:15.94]You're not completely dead.
[31:21.55]More like running.
[31:23.45]Yeah, good call.
[31:24.59]Jesus Christ.
[31:25.85]Leon, we gotta back up.
[31:31.59]Are there quick time events?
[31:32.97]What the...
[31:41.14]That's a zombie driving a car.
[31:42.38]Are you talking about- Oh, no it's not.
[31:44.36]Holy shit.
[31:45.78]There, get out.
[31:56.69]He's just speeding through.
[31:57.87]No, he's dead.
[32:07.78]Watch out.
[32:14.71]Dripping oil.
[32:17.65]Dripping gasoline.
[32:22.73]Claire was probably in there, right?
[32:24.07]That's what I'm thinking.
[32:25.23]What is this?
[32:32.70]This is loud.
[32:34.10]I'm gonna have to turn the game down a little.
[32:40.53]I remember this from the first one.
[32:46.72]I gotta get out of here.
[32:51.98]I gotta run.
[32:52.38]What's the run button?
[32:53.44]How do you run?
[32:54.86]I don't want to shoot.
[32:56.76]There's like 50 people here.
[32:58.49]I just want to run.
[33:00.93]Capcom, what's the run button?
[33:18.49]Just tell me what the run button is.
[33:26.92]Is there no run in this game?
[33:28.74]Press in left stick.
[33:29.76]That would have been great to know.
[33:34.24]No, just kill me.
[33:35.34]Somebody kill me.
[33:36.28]Kill me.
[33:39.40]Do it.
[33:39.68]Just bite my fucking neck open.
[33:41.64]Kill me.
[33:43.96]Just like every other game?
[33:44.82]No, it's like B or A. Holding it.
[33:55.50]No, it was actually X in the original one.
[33:58.02]It was the face button here.
[34:03.54]That's the... Let's take a... That's how Leon dies.
[34:05.96]Let's check out Claire's side of the view.
[34:07.78]Let's check out Claire's view.
[34:09.84]No, wait!
[34:10.18]No, no, no, no, no.
[34:10.86]No, yeah, hold on.
[34:11.44]I wanted to... No, that's fine.
[34:16.90]Because I wanted to, like, alt-tab before, and I can't.
[34:23.01]Just stop there for a second.
[34:27.61]Do I really have to pull this out of borderless window to alt-tab the game?
[34:31.23]Because I can't move.
[34:35.13]Hold on.
[34:35.47]Get out of the way for a second, game.
[34:43.55]Okay.
[34:45.87]Okay, okay, okay.
[34:48.55]I'm just making sure I don't have anything open that would be using any resources, but I don't.
[34:53.27]It was a long shot, but it was worth a try.
[34:59.73]Another huge amount of money just came in.
[35:02.61]That was from Miniclips.
[35:05.03]Thank you, Miniclips, for the $50.
[35:06.59]Off to a good start.
[35:07.69]Keep it up.
[35:12.51]Thank you so much for the $50.
[35:13.38]Okay, now let's go.
[35:19.86]Oh, I tried to bait him.
[35:20.76]You blame Cox for this, because I'm like, how many frames did I drop today?
[35:27.98]Blame this dogshit internet company.
[35:38.60]Alright, let's go.
[35:40.88]So which way?
[35:41.40]Should I go this way?
[35:41.96]Into the alley?
[35:48.81]Oh fuck.
[35:53.19]Aging boomer can't figure out internet.
[35:57.53]No, it's called a bunch of fucking workers just throw a bunch of lines.
[36:03.73]Bury a bunch of fucking lines.
[36:05.79]Don't even care if it works.
[36:06.91]They just build it.
[36:08.21]And then the company that's responsible for it just kind of goes, does it work?
[36:12.99]Yeah, it technically works.
[36:14.59]Alright, then fucking just turn it on for everybody.
[36:16.19]Who cares?
[36:16.65]I don't know.
[36:19.31]There may be like a problem.
[36:20.55]I think there's like water down there.
[36:21.89]Nah, then fucking just turn it on for everybody.
[36:23.35]Who cares?
[36:36.68]How much would it cost for us to, like, fix that?
[36:39.27]Like, 40 grand?
[36:42.17]I don't know about that.
[36:42.87]How much did we take in last month from subscriptions?
[36:46.71]12 million.
[36:47.95]No, I don't know about that.
[36:49.27]I don't think that's worth it.
[36:50.61]No, no, just keep it on.
[36:52.17]Turn it on.
[36:54.94]No, hold on.
[36:55.28]I gotta pay attention.
[36:55.92]Hold on.
[36:56.20]Let me see.
[37:05.64]No.
[37:09.97]It's like, seriously.
[37:16.65]I bet you whatever this problem is could be solved if just somebody gave a shit.
[37:22.19]You know what I mean?
[37:24.73]Like, if anybody, if anybody from here to here just gave a shit, this wouldn't happen.
[37:40.64]Oh, I remember this place.
[37:41.53]This is the police station.
[37:44.21]Jerma is mad.
[37:45.69]I am, because it's fucking stupid.
[37:49.01]There we go, bolts.
[37:54.07]Alright, that's six.
[37:54.85]You get six handgun ammo.
[37:58.82]Takes up a spot in the inventory, right?
[38:03.72]Okay, we got a RPD.
[38:06.44]This is the storage box.
[38:08.90]And a save point.
[38:10.42]Thank God I don't have to do the hardcore ribbon shit.
[38:17.49]Anything... Sometimes there's stuff in the boxes, but I think a key, well-worn key.
[38:23.50]I don't think I'm going to need this.
[38:24.70]This is the key to the store.
[38:31.34]Probably shouldn't have this anymore.
[38:37.77]Right?
[38:38.27]I mean, is that... That's not like a skeleton key, right?
[38:46.29]Do I write for IGN?
[38:52.74]What?
[39:02.69]Watch out!
[39:05.71]There's Chicky over there on the bottom right camera.
[39:08.63]Check camera, no, no, camera three.
[39:10.77]Freddy's on camera three, go check it.
[39:13.40]You guys wouldn't believe it.
[39:16.26]Doesn't matter, like when I was in Massachusetts.
[39:32.62]I'm fucking in Las Vegas.
[39:33.56]Doesn't matter.
[39:34.42]You know how many people you have to go through before you find the guy that's like, yeah, I guess I'll take care of that.
[39:40.54]Like, this is just like super ultra company bullshit.
[39:44.84]There's a guy that you have to talk to to see if you have a real problem.
[39:48.22]Then that guy has to talk to another guy above him about how your problem's real.
[39:51.68]That guy then has to be currently caring about your current situation to talk to the guy above him
[39:56.70]To say we have to fix the problem that's going on with the guy.
[39:58.88]Guy 5 below me said there was an issue, but guy 2 said it might not be an issue.
[40:03.03]Guy 11, that's like the regional manager.
[40:23.27]Jeremiah, stop.
[40:23.89]It's getting annoying.
[40:27.33]Like this?
[40:28.25]You're talking about me dropping a dickload of frames.
[40:31.83]That is annoying.
[40:32.39]You're right.
[40:32.73]Alright.
[40:40.54]Put gun in circle left.
[40:43.02]Bullets in circle right.
[40:49.60]Alright.
[40:50.30]So.
[40:52.06]Do I have a knife yet?
[40:52.68]I don't think I do.
[40:57.46]No.
[40:58.26]Not yet.
[41:03.72]Can you please adjust your internet?
[41:06.64]Alright, so I need to go... Let's, uh... So, here's the map.
[41:12.70]The map is very useful for more than just your current location and surroundings.
[41:16.22]It will also show you points of interest and items you have found and haven't picked up yet.
[41:23.32]Ooh.
[41:24.72]Oh, that's cool.
[41:25.36]Taped box.
[41:27.20]goddess statue.
[41:27.98]So it'll tell you pretty much everything in the room.
[41:30.48]That's really cool.
[41:32.38]The door over here, I wonder if I can open it.
[41:33.70]Let's find out.
[41:44.04]You probably have a bunch of torrents seating.
[41:47.30]I would be very surprised.
[41:49.54]I need the spade key to open this door, which I do not have.
[41:52.85]So let's go take a look upstairs.
[42:11.16]Let me see.
[42:12.54]Two doors up here.
[42:14.48]How's this one?
[42:16.48]This one opens.
[42:17.23]Alright.
[42:17.67]Isn't there like a police chief in here?
[42:21.61]From what I remember.
[42:22.33]Is somebody above?
[42:29.03]Alright, I got the herb.
[42:34.44]Uh, got combining herbs.
[42:35.94]I'm gonna have to remember this shit.
[42:40.51]this safe.
[42:42.63]Anybody know?
[42:43.07]No, don't tell me the combination.
[42:43.95]I don't want to know.
[42:55.70]Shit.
[43:00.02]Alright, we got a photograph here.
[43:01.74]Guide pamphlet.
[43:03.41]Welcome to Raccoon City.
[43:04.49]Did you know, while we are the home of pharmaceutical giant Umbrella Corporation, Raccoon City is a vibrant and dynamic city with a long, rich history of its own.
[43:12.68]In this guide, we'll introduce you to a few more unusual points of interest.
[43:17.88]The police station.
[43:19.12]Inside the police station, there are...
[43:24.33]The skipping makes my webcam look pre-recorded.
[43:27.06]Look, ready?
[43:27.74]It's not.
[43:28.38]One, two, three, see?
[43:31.24]Various features like the unusual clock tower.
[43:33.20]Yeah, yeah.
[43:33.96]This is an orphanage.
[43:35.80]That's pretty cool.
[43:39.70]Any more points of interest?
[43:41.24]There is the safe.
[43:42.58]That's it.
[43:42.97]This door needs a spade key.
[43:44.49]I don't have it.
[43:46.37]So let's keep going.
[43:49.25]What do we got in here for Coca-Cola?
[43:52.23]We got camp-a, art-a, foooood, food.
[44:00.27]Crack open a food soda.
[44:08.22]There's also across the hall.
[44:09.96]And then I could leave and check the other parts of the town, but let's just see what's up here first.
[44:22.07]Another puzzle with some dials on it.
[44:25.93]Okay.
[44:27.82]All information that will be presented in some way or another.
[44:30.30]I'm gonna have to get my notebook.
[44:36.68]A spade key as well.
[44:37.62]Alright, so I cannot go in any of these rooms.
[44:43.39]There are bullets up here, which is good.
[44:47.41]And that leaves us with going back downstairs.
[44:54.83]Pre-recorded?
[44:55.79]Confirmed?
[44:56.88]Oh, you want me to dab.
[44:57.76]Well, that's not gonna happen.
[45:00.16]Just use the emote and pretend I did it.
[45:05.36]Just pretend I did it with the emote.
[45:10.31]Alright, so let's go back out.
[45:13.31]There's the interrogation room.
[45:14.71]Let's save it first, just so I have a clean slate.
[45:19.33]Can't get in there, can't get in there, can't get in there.
[45:20.87]Okay.
[45:27.02]He dabbed.
[45:28.26]Well, I did just wipe my nose, so you're not completely wrong here.
[45:33.13]First aid spray.
[45:34.93]No, pick it up.
[45:38.79]Oh, did I miss?
[45:39.77]I didn't miss anything down here, right?
[45:42.21]I better not have.
[45:42.83]Did I crawl under here?
[45:57.63]alright it says keep out but that's alright I'll go in so you got company yet you got guy like number 11.
[46:26.57]Alright, need a fuse.
[46:27.43]Okay, nothing back there.
[46:32.79]Let's just go.
[46:44.64]East office.
[46:45.62]Let's check the office.
[46:47.69]If I can.
[46:48.13]I can't.
[47:01.95]I'm gonna be so meticulous here, guys.
[47:04.21]I'm sorry, I have to.
[47:06.47]You got this.
[47:09.13]Don't talk.
[47:11.05]Why would you talk?
[47:11.65]My press room is right here to the left.
[47:23.87]God damn it.
[47:24.51]Okay.
[47:29.94]Press room.
[47:31.86]Turn the lights on.
[47:32.48]Ooh, bullets.
[47:34.52]Nice.
[47:35.10]Only three?
[47:35.60]How did you only have three bullets?
[47:37.42]You didn't come prepared.
[47:38.12]Alright.
[47:41.46]Finally.
[47:41.84]Good.
[47:42.20]You can actually see what the hell I'm doing.
[47:49.41]I can think of a pretty good joke here where I give a fake speech like I'm talking to the press.
[47:54.47]But it would just devolve into me talking about Cox.
[47:58.13]Though, I'm not going to do that.
[48:09.66]No, oh yeah, it's the name of the terrible company.
[48:21.19]Did I miss, what am I, is this a... All typewriter shaped objects save points?
[48:29.98]I guess not.
[48:34.42]Do the speech, no, I'm not.
[48:37.32]No speeches.
[48:41.87]No speeches, just sunny beaches.
[48:45.90]No speeches, sunny beaches.
[48:52.42]Okay.
[48:56.77]Okay, I'm good.
[49:10.08]Cleaning in progress.
[49:11.50]Hydrate.
[49:14.44]Yep.
[49:15.62]What's over here?
[49:16.50]Got a bathroom.
[49:17.68]And... Alright, what's in the bathroom?
[49:26.40]How many gonna be in the stall?
[49:29.78]There was the door closing behind me.
[49:31.02]Okay, whatever.
[49:34.26]There's gonna be a person in one of these stalls.
[49:36.01]This is a horror game.
[49:49.23]Nope.
[49:52.17]Just the wet bandits, that's all.
[49:55.60]There's no bullets or anything in here?
[50:00.14]Why even let me come in here?
[50:01.00]What was that?
[50:20.72]Lantern?
[50:21.90]Can I, like, pick up the lantern?
[50:22.98]No, I don't think so.
[50:30.16]Blind!
[50:30.48]He's blind!
[50:30.97]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[50:31.59]What do you mean he's blind?
[50:35.27]Did I miss something?
[50:37.85]What did I miss?
[50:38.41]I thought it was, like, hairspray.
[50:44.46]I didn't think it was, like, a healing item.
[50:47.34]I thought that was, like, for your head.
[50:55.46]I'm gonna sneeze.
[50:55.94]Okay.
[50:59.90]Alright, we're good.
[51:08.47]What's in here?
[51:09.59]Coffee, and I could use some right now.
[51:12.55]Jesus.
[51:19.21]Oh, this is something wrong here.
[51:21.39]Something, this is, oh, this is something wrong here.
[51:24.43]I'm just gonna leave it.
[51:25.83]Maybe I can shoot it off.
[51:27.77]Possible.
[51:29.15]Although that's a waste of a bullet, isn't it?
[51:32.83]We just had five community subs come in from Herbert.
[51:35.41]Thank you, Herbert, for the five community subs.
[51:37.83]Congratulations to all of you that got a community sub.
[51:42.65]Open up!
[51:43.95]Hurry!
[51:45.41]Open up!
[51:46.55]Where?
[51:46.91]Open this goddamn door!
[51:48.67]No, wrong one.
[51:49.45]Sorry.
[51:49.83]Are you still alive?
[51:53.33]I can't open the door, dude.
[51:54.63]I'm sorry.
[51:55.13]The door's locked.
[51:56.87]Just, he's blocking it with his body.
[52:03.24]Oh.
[52:04.30]What he's talking about.
[52:06.78]Here.
[52:11.07]Oh, got cash?
[52:12.63]I'll take that cash.
[52:31.14]Quick, put him back under the rug!
[52:32.62]Put him back under!
[52:33.30]Oh my god, that's disgusting.
[52:48.27]It's ridiculous.
[52:50.19]Officer's notebook.
[52:51.13]Okay, hold on.
[52:52.48]Goddess statue.
[52:53.28]Then we get three.
[52:54.28]Three medallions.
[52:54.98]This guy was just playing the game.
[52:58.16]He was almost done with figuring it out.
[53:02.68]So a statue that goes down underneath.
[53:06.64]So after you put the three medallions in, you can go through underneath the statue and then get out.
[53:15.94]Okay, so we got some symbols here, which now will allow us to go to the symbol machine and spin it around until we get out of here.
[53:26.45]Okay.
[53:29.63]You have anything to add?
[53:47.37]Oh, fuck.
[53:48.09]Okay.
[53:49.84]Take a left up here.
[53:55.16]Left and then a left.
[53:58.59]No, let's get to the fuse box.
[54:00.45]Yeah, no, that'll work.
[54:01.15]Let's go.
[54:09.76]Ah!
[54:32.36]pinpoint precision.
[54:33.24]Sometimes you have to be good at that, you know?
[54:35.54]You gotta be prepared sometimes.
[54:38.28]Quick time.
[54:45.34]Crush his head.
[54:47.52]Nice work.
[54:50.72]There, there's the chief.
[54:59.39]Leon Kennedy.
[55:00.85]Stock sound effect.
[55:08.35]Beer.
[55:15.25]I'm sure you did what you could, Leon.
[55:16.61]Alright, so now I have the... Does anyone know what started this?
[55:25.70]Not a clue.
[55:27.57]But honestly, all you need to know is that this place will eat you alive if you aren't careful.
[55:32.19]Yeah, well, I was supposed to start last week, and I got a call to stay away.
[55:34.72]I'm not going to mention his stomach.
[55:38.44]You're here now, Leon.
[55:39.34]That's all that matters.
[55:41.84]Hey, yo, dude, I got some spray paint for that wound.
[55:44.52]I'm ready.
[55:45.50]You want it?
[55:46.24]Hopefully, you'll be able to find a way out of this station.
[55:49.20]That officer you met earlier, Elliot, he thought this secret passageway might do the trick.
[55:56.39]Hmm.
[55:58.49]This is good news.
[56:00.20]We can get you to a hospital.
[56:01.46]No, no, I am not the priority here.
[56:03.40]Lieutenant, I'm not just going to leave you here.
[56:05.48]I'm giving you an order, rookie.
[56:07.74]You save yourself first.
[56:10.88]I'd come with you, but I'd just slow you down.
[56:14.45]Just open your mouth.
[56:16.89]You'll need this.
[56:19.25]I can't take it.
[56:19.99]Stop.
[56:21.13]I can't take your lightsaber.
[56:23.04]Take it.
[56:23.70]Fine.
[56:24.00]Don't make my mistake.
[56:26.40]A Jedi never can give up his lightsaber.
[56:28.42]Uniform or not, you do not hesitate.
[56:33.57]You take it out or you run.
[56:37.21]Got it?
[56:39.45]Yes, sir.
[56:56.23]knife equip on the inventory screen to use this knife wears down with use and will break when its gauge is depleted lbrt okay can be used to counter-attack lb when you are caught by an enemy and can only be retrieved once you defeat them what okay how do I repair it do I only get one knife with a one bar of damage I'm allowed to do
[57:27.76]Okay, Left Bumper and... Is it not equipped?
[57:37.63]As you take damage, your health monitor in the bottom left will drop from fine to caution to danger.
[57:41.93]When in danger, quickly heal yourself with a green herb or first aid spray before it's too late.
[57:47.63]Interestingly enough, I'm looking at the same thing over here.
[57:50.49]Uh...
[57:52.07]I'm looking at my... I'm going to give you a cocks internet dog shit reference.
[57:55.67]Right?
[57:55.85]You got... Green is fine.
[57:57.13]I've been yellow this whole time.
[57:58.39]And then sometimes it drops to danger.
[58:01.23]For an hour straight.
[58:02.61]What a great reference.
[58:03.55]He's still angry and he won't get over it.
[58:05.13]I can't get over it.
[58:05.85]It's not going to happen.
[58:09.31]Alright, so it's equipped.
[58:11.43]So... Okay, so you have to hit them both to... I guess not.
[58:15.89]Okay.
[58:17.35]And then you swing.
[58:18.52]I'm not using durability...
[58:22.13]Thanks for the jumpscare.
[58:23.85]For whoever just called me.
[58:24.77]Alright, let's go.
[58:28.32]So now I got the... I gotta go back up here.
[58:38.36]So let's see the symbols.
[58:39.28]We can go... Looks like I have... Okay, the notebook.
[58:45.65]Should I go lion?
[58:48.39]Lion, witch, or wardrobe?
[58:49.63]Which one?
[58:50.25]I'm gonna go... Hmm...
[58:53.27]Lion's just right here.
[58:54.31]Let's go with lion.
[58:55.35]So we need lion, herb, and then dove.
[59:08.51]This is going to take us to... There we go.
[59:14.04]Thank you!
[59:15.00]Lion medallion.
[59:19.10]I'm only going to be... I've got to put something in the box.
[59:22.17]Next one is Lady Arrowsnake.
[59:26.73]Oh, I can't do it again.
[59:40.78]Oh.
[59:42.12]Okay.
[59:43.36]Well, might as well just put it in.
[59:54.04]Cool.
[59:55.00]Alright.
[59:58.54]I need two more.
[60:05.09]What are you playing over there?
[60:07.47]Alright.
[60:07.93]Now, let's see.
[60:08.85]I had East Office.
[60:13.37]Let's save it.
[60:23.17]I could use the heal, but I don't think I need to yet.
[60:31.24]I could use the herb, but you can combine herbs and shit in this game.
[60:34.34]I'm not gonna do it yet.
[60:38.84]Why am I being selfish?
[60:39.83]Give him the first aid spray.
[60:48.33]Okay.
[60:49.87]So, we've got... Okay, go back over here.
[60:53.51]I don't think I can even leave this way.
[60:56.41]Oh, no, the taped box is right here.
[60:58.17]That's right.
[60:59.91]Let's go check it out.
[61:01.51]Why are my graphics so bad?
[61:02.91]I don't think they are.
[61:03.63]I think... What's wrong with my graphics?
[61:06.19]What are you talking about?
[61:11.30]Image quality, 100%.
[61:14.78]Anti-aliasing.
[61:16.68]Texture quality high.
[61:18.16]Texture filter high.
[61:20.03]Mesh quality medium.
[61:21.83]High.
[61:22.49]On.
[61:23.33]On.
[61:23.85]On.
[61:24.53]On.
[61:26.07]Medium.
[61:27.93]High.
[61:30.42]What's wrong?
[61:33.96]Turned off the bloom.
[61:34.66]Turned off the motion blur.
[61:39.70]Yeah, I'm an old Counter-Strike pro, guys.
[61:42.57]I don't put on graphics.
[61:44.19]I can see better when there's not a bunch of, like, bloom and shit.
[61:46.27]Alright, can I... is it... Yeah.
[61:57.73]I was about to potentially just waste.
[62:06.27]The film grain is not on?
[62:08.76]What do you mean?
[62:09.84]Film grain?
[62:11.34]The film grain is off.
[62:13.26]At least I thought I turned it off.
[62:20.97]Film noise is off.
[62:22.27]What?
[62:28.36]Put it on!
[62:36.12]Alright, now let's go, let's do this.
[62:40.88]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[62:43.24]I'm such a hoarder.
[62:45.42]Because there's yellow and red herbs too, right?
[62:59.53]Dude, on the lowest graphics, I would never...
[63:04.15]Alright, let's just leave.
[63:05.85]Nothing else in here.
[63:06.53]Okay, what do we got?
[63:18.56]I'm not gonna... No.
[63:21.36]I'm not doing the 3DS port joke again.
[63:30.83]Here, I'll do... Here's what I'll do for you.
[63:33.93]Because one guy told me to do this, so one guy is going to get it.
[63:41.00]We'll do TAA.
[63:42.46]Okay.
[63:49.37]That actually looks worse for me.
[63:50.45]That looks worse.
[63:55.53]It looks like somebody blew, like, cold air in my eyes.
[64:09.17]Seriously, gelatin.
[64:10.53]What?
[64:17.08]You got anything else you got?
[64:17.90]What do you want to do with the window?
[64:25.41]What?
[64:36.95]Okay, I need the club key.
[64:49.24]Something's gonna happen here.
[64:50.30]Somebody's gonna attack me.
[64:51.58]There's gonna be... I'm trying to remember.
[64:53.30]Isn't there a... Look at how long this hallway is.
[64:58.55]This hallway's too long for there not to be something that comes up.
[65:03.55]What does he want me to... What do you want me to do with the window here?
[65:15.30]Yep.
[65:16.20]Okay, I was ready for it.
[65:18.92]Open these, open the, open the blinds.
[65:26.60]Did you get in?
[65:27.36]Did you get in?
[65:27.94]I think you got in.
[65:28.62]But wait, is there anything over here?
[65:29.70]Any items?
[65:30.54]Did you get, you got in.
[65:31.28]Okay, let's go, go, go, go, go.
[65:37.16]They're not smart enough to follow me in here, right?
[65:38.56]Okay, there's a way to go that way.
[65:43.14]Hold on.
[65:43.76]What's this?
[65:45.30]Record of events.
[65:46.56]We're turning the station into a temporary shelter due to the massive sudden outbreak.
[65:51.92]All police personnel have been instructed to make the safety of the citizens their top priority.
[65:57.90]And then all hell broke loose and it went to shit.
[66:02.23]Yeah, it is a lag stream today, unfortunately.
[66:08.19]This is wild.
[66:10.44]I don't think there was one drop frame at all two days ago.
[66:13.60]It's ridiculous that like not even two days later, it's like barely a streamable day.
[66:20.64]I wish there was something I could do.
[66:21.46]Alright, I got a police station first floor map, which is good.
[66:31.56]Okay, open that up a lot.
[66:33.19]Good.
[66:35.21]So going over here, this is the safety deposit room.
[66:39.17]Or towards the safety deposit room.
[66:41.63]See if I can... Can I open this door?
[66:45.65]Thanks for the tip!
[66:53.43]This is very... I need like wire cutters or something.
[66:55.75]Okay, so...
[67:08.82]Can I bang a left up here into the safety deposit room?
[67:11.74]Or is that, no, that was locked, wasn't it?
[67:17.36]Can I turn the flashlight off?
[67:24.74]Oh, goddammit.
[67:27.64]Ah.
[67:40.78]What is this?
[67:43.26]More handgun ammo?
[67:45.10]Alright, I got a lot of ammo, so I should be okay to at least shoot somebody once.
[67:51.86]One bullet should be fine.
[67:55.34]Uses of gunpowder.
[67:58.10]Gunpowder times two is handgun ammo.
[67:59.56]Gunpowder plus high-grade gunpowder.
[68:01.32]So gunpowder plus yellow is shotgun.
[68:04.02]And then gunpowder +2 yellows is mag ammo.
[68:08.67]Okay.
[68:11.79]There's not a lot of ammo left around the station, so maybe it's just how many gunpowder you find.
[68:14.87]Different guns require different ammo.
[68:17.13]So pay attention when you're combining things or you won't get what you need.
[68:26.15]Gunpowder.
[68:28.63]Okay.
[68:32.51]Fuck.
[68:36.87]Okay, I have to shoot this guy in the head.
[68:38.38]I gotta kill this guy, I think.
[68:42.48]I have to shoot him.
[68:43.02]I have to kill him.
[68:49.06]God damn it, really?
[68:52.67]Okay, get me out.
[68:54.15]Before he gets up.
[68:54.73]He might get up.
[69:02.37]Alright, no more.
[69:03.01]Don't shoot anybody else.
[69:06.38]Let's see what we got.
[69:07.06]We got a spade key.
[69:08.06]We got something over here.
[69:09.18]That's a safe.
[69:12.73]What the hell?
[69:13.48]What the hell was that?
[69:14.66]What the fuck?
[69:17.26]What the fuck, man?
[69:18.60]Okay.
[69:21.44]Your mission is to unlock your desk.
[69:23.10]The key to your success is in the initials of our first names.
[69:29.04]Input the letters in order of our desks.
[69:32.30]There are two locks, one on each side of your desk.
[69:35.06]Make sure you get them both.
[69:38.31]Basically, your first task is to remember your fellow officers' names, but you've figured that much out, right?
[69:43.23]Good luck, Leon.
[69:44.85]By the way, it might take a little work to get Scott to give you a straight answer.
[69:51.49]Be glad you're not here, rookie.
[69:57.47]They're just, they fuck with me on my first day.
[70:02.28]In the initials of our first names, input the letters in order of our desks.
[70:07.90]So we got Scott.
[70:09.93]Right?
[70:10.35]What does it say?
[70:10.79]Scott?
[70:14.35]So, S. So who else?
[70:19.59]Who wrote this?
[70:25.71]S and B?
[70:28.01]S, B?
[70:44.98]What?
[70:46.74]Hold on.
[70:47.24]The initials of our first names?
[70:57.25]Does this have an S?
[71:01.35]I'm going to have to look at everybody's name tags.
[71:10.50]Cops are known for their love of puzzles.
[71:15.02]okay so let me look at that one more time because so we're gonna look at the desks okay this is David David Ford alright this guy's gotta die maybe not alright we got m where are you coming from I knew you were gonna get up m
[71:42.80]M. Oh, god damn it.
[71:45.25]So this is the... Okay.
[71:49.85]Name tag.
[71:50.81]We got N. It's down to just me and three others.
[72:00.26]No weapons, no ammo, and too many skirmishes.
[72:01.94]Well, who are you?
[72:02.54]I don't care about any of this.
[72:03.98]E. So N-E.
[72:07.78]N-E-D is this one.
[72:14.80]Ned.
[72:15.77]Okay.
[72:19.35]And then this one is... M. I don't need to kill you.
[72:31.01]What is your name?
[72:31.61]What the fuck is your name?
[72:47.33]Give me the knife back.
[72:54.84]God.
[72:55.80]Give me the knife.
[72:58.86]It's almost broken.
[73:03.20]Okay, that was George.
[73:04.32]So that's G. R. M. George.
[73:16.43]George RR Martin.
[73:23.23]Open the desk.
[73:25.21]High capacity mag.
[73:28.29]And?
[73:31.35]No.
[73:31.55]I have to take one of these.
[73:44.89]I gotta take one of those herbs.
[73:46.25]I have to.
[73:46.99]I hate that I have to do it.
[73:48.47]I hate it.
[73:49.35]I'm gonna... No, but I can combine these.
[73:54.73]Just do it.
[73:55.42]Fuck it.
[73:59.04]I'm not taking any heals.
[74:11.97]Goodbye.
[74:19.94]What did I do wrong?
[74:20.66]What are you talking about?
[74:21.22]Isn't that for a machine gun?
[74:23.24]Alright, I'm getting out of here.
[74:36.19]Where the fuck am I gonna go now?
[74:37.27]Safety?
[74:37.57]I can't open this door.
[74:39.85]I can, apparently.
[74:43.34]It's for the pistol?
[74:53.13]I just, I saw that the mag and I thought it was the gunpowder said that like pistol and then shotgun mag and I was like, oh, a mag for... Fuck me.
[75:11.38]I've only been on fucking Comcast.
[75:13.00]Not even, that's the wrong company.
[75:15.84]Okay.
[75:17.44]It's alright though.
[75:18.25]I was going to combine them anyways eventually.
[75:21.41]So it can hold 24 rounds, cool.
[75:25.63]Oh my god.
[75:27.33]Oh my fucking Jesus.
[75:31.49]The Olaf just gave 50 community subs.
[75:35.27]50.
[75:37.29]50!
[75:37.31]50!
[75:41.92]Gifting a moron!
[75:45.50]I'm not a moron!
[75:48.68]It's very dark in here.
[75:50.02]Do you see how dark it is?
[75:51.06]You think you can read a screen when it's this dark?
[75:59.28]Thank you so much for the 50 community subs.
[76:03.62]That's a shitload.
[76:06.24]You are an idiot.
[76:09.22]Look, I'm like juggling so much stuff right now.
[76:14.61]I'm juggling, I'm juggling with the fact not only do I'm playing this game, I got a dark room, I got an internet that's not working.
[76:19.51]I had diarrhea this morning, still have it.
[76:23.61]It's coming up right now.
[76:25.21]I've been going like this to try to keep it quiet.
[76:37.84]Anyways, that's a huge amount of money.
[76:39.12]Thank you so much.
[76:39.76]209.
[76:43.62]109.
[76:44.04]I don't know what that means.
[76:48.16]I think it's moot.
[76:49.46]Thank you very much.
[76:51.16]First try.
[76:52.00]Got it?
[76:53.56]Fucking Jesus, man.
[76:56.32]This is 23,000 dropped frames.
[76:58.40]Should I even stop?
[76:59.73]Should I just stop and do something else?
[77:01.53]Because I don't want this to be like a lag dog shit stream.
[77:12.59]This is something I've been looking forward to doing for a long time.
[77:14.60]Alright, what we got?
[77:18.28]We got prizes.
[77:19.70]Okay, this is 203.
[77:20.34]I think it's missing.
[77:24.00]208 is shotgun.
[77:25.10]That one's already open.
[77:27.21]109, 108.
[77:27.73]106, where is he?
[77:29.69]103, 102.
[77:41.09]I swear to God, is there another guy over here?
[77:42.43]Okay, 1-0... Let's do 1-0... 1-0-8?
[77:48.82]No?
[77:49.12]1-0-7... Which one's the one right there?
[77:53.76]1-0-2.
[77:57.64]1-0-2 and 1-0-3.
[77:57.88]Oh, there is no 2.
[77:58.83]Okay, I need to find the 2.
[78:09.21]Can any of these other ones be opened?
[78:10.79]103?
[78:10.85]No, 2 and 3 are both gone.
[78:13.96]So none of these can be opened until I get the number off of the keyboard, whatever the hell I have to do.
[78:20.18]What about this?
[78:20.84]This is a weapons locker.
[78:22.26]I need a key card.
[78:23.02]I don't have it.
[78:25.71]There's a shotgun in there.
[78:26.67]That's pretty amazing.
[78:30.09]I don't think I can do much in here right now, so let's go back to...
[78:40.33]Uh... Let me, um... Give me one second.
[78:52.89]Let me go take a piss.
[78:54.81]Let me figure out what the hell I want to do about this, because... It has not gotten better, and I really was going to give it like an hour or so.
[79:01.43]So we need to do something else, I think.
[79:03.63]Unfortunately, I'm sorry.
[79:07.07]Let me see what else we can do.
[79:09.16]I was, like, praying that this wasn't going to happen for this long, but it has, so.
[79:13.00]I'll be right back.
[79:13.60]We'll figure it out.
[79:39.89]Yeah.
[80:34.11]Yeah, it seems to have gotten worse since I just left.
[81:01.56]So, I really don't know what to do about it.
[81:04.36]All I can do is continue to try to get every ISP I've ever had to fix their fucking internet.
[81:11.30]So, it's stupid.
[81:26.79]So, I do apologize.
[81:27.73]I'm sorry.
[81:28.35]I really was looking forward to doing Resident Evil 2 tonight.
[81:31.66]I was planning on going for a long time.
[81:36.58]But, I don't know.
[81:40.52]Kind of at the mercy of this shit.
[81:43.22]So, I'm really sorry guys.
[81:48.85]I'm gonna give it like another 20 to 30 minutes.
[81:52.65]And if it's still doing it, if we still have problems...
[81:56.46]Then we'll just go IRL and I'll just hang out.
[81:58.62]We'll just chill and maybe play GeoGuessr or something.
[82:02.29]Or something else.
[82:03.37]Maybe we'll just hang out for a little while.
[82:05.05]We'll try again tomorrow.
[82:08.21]I'm going to also get in touch with Cox as well.
[82:12.85]Let's see what happens.
[82:21.66]So...
[82:25.02]So many subs came in, too.
[82:27.42]Thanks a lot, guys.
[82:29.36]Appreciate the patience.
[82:31.23]So, let me look at what's over here.
[82:33.55]Storage locker terminal memo.
[82:36.85]It appears that the keypad to the locker's terminal is missing a few keys.
[82:39.83]I suggest that the person responsible for this mess find some spare keys and fix this right now.
[82:47.00]Spare keys.
[82:49.18]Interesting.
[82:50.48]Spare keys.
[82:53.10]Wherever that would be.
[83:02.23]Uh, so, locker terminal, dark room.
[83:04.71]How do I get to the dark room?
[83:05.77]Just through here?
[83:11.05]Jesus.
[83:13.48]Somebody's gonna come from the right side, I just know it.
[83:19.64]What's this?
[83:21.32]A heal.
[83:25.97]I could take that.
[83:26.87]Let's open this.
[83:27.67]Ooh, what's that?
[83:29.37]Wooden boards?
[83:30.57]One.
[83:30.75]Oh, I thought there was a gun taped to this.
[83:34.78]Oh, shit.
[83:40.34]Wooden board.
[83:40.92]A sturdy piece of wood that can be used to board up windows.
[83:43.10]Perfect for keeping the riffraff out.
[83:48.58]Let's just eat the herb.
[83:54.94]So, should I board up this window?
[83:56.64]I could board that window up.
[84:03.86]I mean, the board in that window... No, I'm just gonna save him.
[84:20.43]Well, he ain't getting it.
[84:21.31]Okay.
[84:26.60]What is in here?
[84:30.01]There's a save point right there.
[84:33.91]Might as well do it.
[84:36.75]It was that simple.
[84:39.74]We saved.
[84:42.04]Additional benefits of herbs.
[84:44.18]Humans have used herbs to treat sickness and disease since the dawn of time.
[84:47.68]In this book, we will explore...
[84:51.58]No, that's a plane.
[84:52.96]That's just a plane.
[84:54.66]I don't know why I thought there was like a bee or a bug enemy in the game or something.
[84:59.54]Green herbs have the ability to heal basic injuries, while blue herbs have been used to treat poisoning.
[85:04.67]As for red, they're very visually appealing.
[85:08.19]They offer no medicinal benefits, or so it was thought until recently.
[85:12.63]Okay.
[85:14.39]It's well known that combining herbs produces blends that heighten the herb's effects, but it's been discovered that red herbs can play a big role when mixed properly.
[85:22.90]Blue and red produces a blend that will strengthen one's constitution.
[85:28.40]Truly, we have just begun to realize the full potential of these herbs and their ability to heal the human body.
[85:32.17]Further research is sure to yield even more fascinating results.
[85:35.19]Red and blue is constitution.
[85:39.27]Very cool.
[85:41.69]And then you can do a triple herb, right?
[85:43.55]Okay.
[85:50.65]Well, there's the gunpowder.
[85:53.52]So do I hold on to... I have such trouble playing these games because I always want to hold on to everything.
[86:03.32]In fact, I'm going to.
[86:04.10]I'm going to store... I'm going to store the herb.
[86:12.21]No, I'm not.
[86:13.61]Let's store a heal.
[86:17.13]Should have kept the damn key.
[86:24.47]Alright, save it one more time.
[86:34.16]Yeah, the red checkmark.
[86:35.00]So wait, you got... Yeah, everyone was... Everybody was telling me that I could have used that key.
[86:40.20]No, I couldn't have.
[86:40.78]It has a red checkmark on it.
[86:45.78]See?
[86:45.99]You can just discard it.
[86:51.25]Okay.
[86:51.49]Okay.
[86:57.73]How do I discard it from... Do I have to do it from here?
[87:01.57]Okay.
[87:04.59]I'm not getting fucked with, right?
[87:10.97]No, I'm not.
[87:12.39]Okay, cool.
[87:15.89]Anything else in here that I need to do?
[87:17.05]This game's fucking good.
[87:19.00]It is.
[87:21.26]It just is.
[87:21.54]Okay.
[87:27.82]So we got some... I need a photo.
[87:29.36]A photo.
[87:35.54]We got some... Oh, this is a red herb.
[87:39.73]Shit.
[87:40.13]Okay.
[87:40.83]Uh... Film contains evidence.
[87:43.17]Do not leave out.
[87:44.21]Okay.
[87:48.43]So I need a photo to put in here.
[87:50.49]And wash it so I can see what it looks like.
[87:52.06]I'm gonna store that herb.
[87:59.62]Guarantee you, I bet you a thousand dollars, that an hour, two, three hours into this playthrough, that box is going to be full of shit that I haven't used yet.
[88:08.39]And I'm going to be like, no, no, no, I need that for later.
[88:09.75]I'm going to need that for later.
[88:11.52]Later is going to come on.
[88:12.32]Dude, hey, are you going to combine the red herbs and the blue herbs?
[88:14.76]No, no, I might need them.
[88:16.49]I think I'm going to need them later.
[88:18.33]They're going to see the credits.
[88:19.59]The credits are going to roll.
[88:21.29]And you're going to say, dude, you never used those blue and red herbs.
[88:25.39]Yeah, but New Game Plus, man, it's going to be important when I need those.
[88:29.27]I'll never use them.
[88:34.27]So let's take a look at the map.
[88:35.08]We've got item box, darkroom, sink.
[88:40.79]Alright, there's so much to explore.
[88:43.72]I can't go into these rooms yet.
[88:48.28]So we're going to have to take a... Let's see, where do I go from here?
[88:51.46]Views box?
[88:52.44]Entrance?
[88:52.90]How the fuck?
[88:54.30]Upstairs, maybe?
[88:55.06]Because I can bang a left and then maybe... Oh, up the stairs.
[89:00.78]There's a stair.
[89:07.07]I remember these stairs from the original game.
[89:27.34]He can't open the door, right?
[89:28.30]Gas.
[89:30.00]Deon.
[89:36.04]Nothing?
[89:38.68]Shotgun shells.
[89:40.58]Store them.
[89:45.25]Portable safe.
[89:48.12]A small portable safe.
[89:49.22]What the fuck am I going to do with that?
[89:51.35]Portable safe instructions.
[89:55.05]Press a button to light up its corresponding lamp.
[89:57.71]Yes, I'm like itching my ear.
[89:59.05]Sometimes when I have to think hard, I go like this and I itch in my ear.
[90:02.67]Press a button to light up its corresponding lamp.
[90:04.57]Then light them all to open the safe.
[90:07.46]The buttons must be pressed in a certain order.
[90:09.18]Pressing a single button out of order will cause all the lights to go out and you will need to start the sequence over again.
[90:14.64]Okay.
[90:17.20]Okay.
[90:19.88]They're going to press them in an order.
[90:25.80]Examining items from different angles.
[90:27.70]You can examine it and spin it around.
[90:31.43]OK.
[90:33.03]So let's go.
[90:34.53]Certain order.
[90:50.46]Okay, okay, okay.
[90:52.06]Top right, bottom right.
[90:54.61]Top right.
[91:01.47]Top right, bottom right, top left.
[91:02.71]Okay.
[91:33.25]Ooh!
[91:34.09]Spare key.
[91:37.77]What number is it?
[91:38.69]One?
[91:40.97]Oh, it doesn't matter what it is, okay.
[91:47.30]Some way I can turn off that gas, right?
[91:55.36]No, I didn't even need to do that.
[91:57.30]Shit.
[92:00.30]It's alright.
[92:04.92]I just shot for no reason.
[92:06.18]Okay.
[92:08.04]Turn the gas off.
[92:09.64]I don't have anything to do that with, but I do have the key now.
[92:12.92]I can probably get something.
[92:13.90]Let me go store.
[92:14.64]No.
[92:14.74]No, don't even walk through it.
[92:20.24]You can't.
[92:22.44]Let's go back to the main room.
[92:26.68]What's this?
[92:27.39]Handgun ammo.
[92:27.79]Really?
[92:30.33]Really?
[92:38.60]Come on.
[92:39.22]Don't, like, bait me here.
[92:40.74]Just... Just get in here.
[92:49.38]No, I don't need to fight this guy.
[92:50.48]I don't need to fight anybody.
[92:54.67]Oh, my God.
[92:55.25]Another $50 just came in.
[92:57.97]Let me go back to the... $50.
[92:59.97]From... From... Apocalyptic Cheeseburger.
[93:08.85]Thank you so much for 50 bucks.
[93:11.92]Going off my last update, my friend says he's getting more calls, but they're already calling back telling him that they're fixed.
[93:17.94]He is also hoping to play Resident Evil 2, the remake tonight.
[93:21.50]And apologies to you for working with people who don't know what they're working with.
[93:26.95]Love you, man.
[93:29.31]Thank you for the $50.
[93:32.63]Thank you so much.
[93:33.23]It's a lot of money.
[93:34.51]It's so much money.
[93:35.79]You guys are giving so much.
[93:37.61]But, no, and the thing with Cox is fixed, yeah.
[93:42.51]But, like, it shouldn't have to be like this.
[93:45.87]It shouldn't be like this.
[93:48.47]It shouldn't be seriously like every other stream, me throwing dice in the air to see if I'm going to be able to turn a stream on.
[93:52.81]You know what I mean?
[93:53.27]I think it just shouldn't be like that.
[93:55.25]And now I mentioned it by name and I just dropped a frame.
[94:01.45]Turn the lights on in my room.
[94:02.83]Oh, here.
[94:06.55]It is getting too dark now.
[94:15.48]There, see?
[94:16.88]That's like, fine.
[94:20.37]That's like, still okay.
[94:24.11]It doesn't have to be like this.
[94:25.55]No, it really doesn't.
[94:30.45]It's just companies loading on as many subscriptions as they can and not caring about anything but a bottom line.
[94:40.49]When you just dump as many possible customers as you possibly can, you don't, it doesn't matter.
[94:46.06]Now we need to go to the dark room.
[94:49.34]No, no, no, no, no.
[94:49.98]The safety deposit room.
[94:57.24]Alright, uh, so I got a new key.
[94:59.10]Let me... Fucking god, I forgot this guy.
[95:02.17]You know, I'm using some bullets.
[95:03.29]I can.
[95:11.60]Like, I'm gonna use a couple of bullets here.
[95:13.02]I don't wanna deal with this guy anymore.
[95:16.20]Okay.
[95:17.30]So, I have a spare key.
[95:19.80]I could do 202, which looks like some kind of fanny pack.
[95:25.62]208, which is shotgun bullets.
[95:28.86]And then I need a key card for this.
[95:30.20]So, should I do fanny pack, or what's the... 109, 106.
[95:32.04]Oh, I saw something I didn't do.
[95:35.28]Okay, we'll get that.
[95:36.10]102... 103 is another knife.
[95:36.62]No, we're gonna do 2.
[95:45.46]How can you still be alive after that?
[95:47.58]No way.
[95:53.36]Just stay down.
[95:57.87]Holy shit.
[95:58.53]Okay.
[96:01.13]Put on... Put it on 2.
[96:02.17]Uh, on 2.
[96:07.45]And then we need to do 2-0... 2-0-3?
[96:09.97]Oh, fuck!
[96:11.65]I can't open that!
[96:12.27]2-0... 2-0-8.
[96:24.29]208, 106.
[96:24.33]106.
[96:24.57]Opens up that.
[96:32.63]Looks like a battery?
[96:35.09]And then, I think... I don't know what the other ones are.
[96:38.26]Let's just get these.
[96:41.44]208.
[96:41.58]Open it up.
[96:44.58]More shotgun ammo.
[96:45.68]Good.
[96:48.68]And then 2106, which is... What the hell is this?
[96:51.80]Ooh!
[96:52.12]Ooh!
[96:55.50]It's a roll of film.
[96:58.46]Back to the darkroom.
[97:03.22]Any others?
[97:03.70]Can I open this one?
[97:05.00]103.
[97:05.10]No, 102 can be opened.
[97:06.54]Let's get it.
[97:15.99]Just gunpowder.
[97:20.00]Alright, back to the darkroom.
[97:22.34]And the storage box.
[97:23.22]I'm gonna burp.
[97:27.10]Okay.
[97:28.10]Uh, so, wrap around.
[97:30.52]The left.
[97:35.66]Right.
[97:41.53]Okay.
[97:41.89]Darkroom and the storage box.
[97:43.55]Good.
[97:45.31]Bah!
[97:45.79]Bah!
[97:46.45]Bah!
[97:46.83]What happened?
[97:48.03]What happened?
[97:48.59]Why is everybody saying bah?
[97:54.69]Got three gunpowders.
[97:55.85]Gonna hold on to them.
[97:57.83]Store the shotgun shells because I don't have a shotgun yet.
[98:00.23]And maybe eventually I will, but not right now.
[98:02.66]And then we got the film.
[98:05.54]Bunch of sheep.
[98:06.64]Bah, bah, bah.
[98:13.52]Film canister.
[98:14.26]Let's give it a try.
[98:15.91]Use.
[98:16.11]Okay, it's a king.
[98:19.59]Commemorative photo.
[98:27.03]I don't get it.
[98:29.57]Is the king with a book in his hand?
[98:35.09]Move the camera so we can see the bullets.
[98:36.55]Oh, that's a good idea.
[98:37.57]You're right.
[98:39.19]You are absolutely right.
[98:46.88]See?
[98:47.00]There we go.
[98:51.86]Okay.
[98:55.35]no no no no back up back up back up back up back up uh that looks okay alright so uh I got the picture of the king whatever that means let me look at that again so it's a picture of a king with a crown and a scepter and a book
[99:25.99]I can't move it around.
[99:26.67]I can't flip it.
[99:27.21]That's just what it looks like.
[99:28.10]Alright.
[99:31.46]Oh, that's good to know.
[99:33.04]Where was that?
[99:35.04]Was there a guy with a book that I missed?
[99:41.83]Not the statue.
[99:43.95]It's the Burger King!
[99:48.35]The Burger King.
[99:49.39]Alright, so it looks like there's some windows down here.
[99:53.11]Operations room, maybe, but I can't go through there.
[99:57.70]Now I can't see health.
[99:58.98]Re.
[100:00.78]Uh.
[100:03.70]I don't know if there's anywhere I can go.
[100:13.12]Let me go back.
[100:15.70]Uh.
[100:15.88]I didn't get any new keys or anything.
[100:20.28]Let me see.
[100:20.84]Maybe back upstairs?
[100:24.07]Just keep your face always over Leon's.
[100:28.02]No, no, no, no, no.
[100:29.35]That's not right.
[100:32.89]There's a safe in there.
[100:34.29]There's a couple of safes.
[100:36.85]Fuse box.
[100:37.13]I don't have a fuse box.
[100:38.13]Maybe up here.
[100:38.71]No.
[100:39.81]Bathroom?
[100:40.31]Break room?
[100:42.33]Watchman's room, maybe?
[100:44.23]This is... Maybe over here.
[100:47.71]Put the cam in the corner.
[100:58.52]More handgun bullets.
[101:11.99]Nobody knows what that is.
[101:13.35]I'm just too old.
[101:15.45]That's Popeye the Sailor Man.
[101:18.39]That's just showing my age.
[101:19.29]I really am getting too old, I think.
[101:25.41]This is... I don't know what the fuck that is.
[101:26.75]Ooh!
[101:41.45]The key!
[101:41.83]The spade key!
[101:42.45]Now we have so many more doors to open.
[101:48.99]Nothing I can do with the, uh... ...the mannequin thing?
[101:52.60]Okay.
[101:59.88]What's this?
[102:00.88]Dial lock?
[102:01.80]Can't do anything about it.
[102:02.64]I need to find a map of this area.
[102:08.69]What in the... Perseverant Lung.
[102:20.12]No.
[102:31.17]To any survivors, consider this a gift to anyone still unfortunate enough to be alive.
[102:36.07]Keep your eyes peeled for those creepy fucks that look like they were skinned alive.
[102:40.20]Lickers, we call them.
[102:41.28]They're blind as bats, but their hearing more than makes up for that.
[102:43.88]I forgot about the other enemies in this game.
[102:45.70]They're like spiders.
[102:47.00]They're lickers.
[102:48.12]They're...
[102:49.69]So as long as you don't run around like a total idiot, guns blazing, you should be able to slip right by them, probably.
[102:54.71]Either way, make like my grandma and creep around as slow as possible.
[102:59.34]Anyway, not that I want to go, but duty calls.
[103:01.44]That, and I got a friend to avenge.
[103:03.12]David.
[103:07.44]Gotta be quiet, and they're blind.
[103:08.78]Now I'm gonna have to turn around.
[103:12.68]There's gonna be one behind me.
[103:15.70]What's the sneak button?
[103:18.16]There is no sneak button.
[103:39.64]Yes, I apologize for the E3 demo, but I just got the word that they're here, so...
[104:21.39]Okay.
[104:22.35]Back to the main hall?
[104:24.19]I look like a dirty version of the original Leon.
[104:26.41]Hey, thanks!
[104:27.39]Can I do a Dark Souls for each, huh?
[104:28.49]I guess not.
[104:29.37]Alright.
[104:29.59]There's so much to look at.
[104:30.59]So much to explore.
[104:53.35]Alright, so far, I'm gonna give my first impressions.
[104:56.57]Kind of bad game.
[105:05.05]I was gonna make... It's a great game.
[105:07.31]Never mind.
[105:08.39]Never mind!
[105:09.59]I go back on everything I just said.
[105:14.54]Where am I?
[105:14.96]The library?
[105:15.60]What's this?
[105:16.54]There's a Jack.
[105:21.74]Red book!
[105:34.32]Hold on, I... So at some point I gotta start fighting, you know what I mean?
[105:38.40]This can't just be like a passive playthrough.
[105:40.44]Is he ever gonna not land a headshot?
[105:52.03]What do you think, guys?
[106:09.96]I mean, headshots only we're talking about.
[106:11.70]Okay, Jack this up.
[106:14.06]Fuck.
[106:18.66]Where can I go with this?
[106:19.50]Over?
[106:19.82]Left?
[106:20.14]Right?
[106:28.43]Can I not?
[106:28.81]I can move this one.
[106:29.83]Why can I not move the other one?
[106:32.41]Whee!
[106:35.97]Can I not do it?
[106:36.55]Can I do it?
[106:39.90]Only headshots we're talking about, guys.
[106:41.16]I'm sorry.
[106:44.16]So, there's shit in the way.
[106:45.32]I can't do it.
[106:45.90]I gotta Jack that up first.
[106:52.26]Okay.
[106:52.76]I need that book!
[106:55.50]What can I do here?
[107:01.91]Boards?
[107:02.31]The window boards?
[107:03.29]Just get rid of them?
[107:07.85]Maybe I could just get rid of the boards.
[107:10.33]I could come back.
[107:11.21]Yeah, come back for it.
[107:12.07]I got the key right.
[107:12.77]Yeah, that's right.
[107:13.21]That's right.
[107:13.53]That's right.
[107:13.85]You're right.
[107:14.27]You got it right.
[107:15.15]I think it's fine.
[107:16.49]The door's right here.
[107:23.97]Back to the main hall.
[107:25.16]That's so cool.
[107:27.16]Just one giant puzzle.
[107:35.26]There we go.
[107:35.76]I got the storage boxes right here.
[107:39.53]There you are.
[107:40.79]Come here.
[107:41.89]Take a look.
[107:45.19]Yes.
[107:45.73]Who is that?
[107:46.45]I knew she'd make it.
[107:48.39]You know her?
[107:48.91]I have no idea who that is.
[107:50.53]Yeah, name's Claire.
[107:51.57]I came into town with her.
[107:53.78]You can get to that courtyard.
[107:55.52]Claire?
[107:55.96]Through the second floor, east side.
[107:59.12]I don't know.
[107:59.46]It doesn't ring a bell.
[108:01.74]I'm on it.
[108:04.18]Thanks, Lieutenant.
[108:08.04]Dude, make a new meme or riot.
[108:10.40]That's not how it works.
[108:12.12]You don't just create a meme because you feel like having a new meme.
[108:15.66]That's not how it works.
[108:17.40]That would not be a true new meme, and it wouldn't at all.
[108:23.17]Alright.
[108:24.37]Gunpowder.
[108:24.83]I'm going to keep the key.
[108:26.89]Keep a couple of heals.
[108:28.97]The boards, I mean... I don't... For now, I guess I don't know what to do with them.
[108:38.52]Make a new meme or I'm unsubbing.
[108:42.47]Nobody is ever required to be subscribed to the channel.
[108:45.71]I'm sorry.
[108:46.17]If you don't deem this channel necessary to subscribe to and pay for, that's on you.
[108:51.89]I can't tell you otherwise.
[108:54.03]But if you're looking for a fresh new meme in 2019, you're going to miss it if you unsubscribe.
[108:59.52]Okay, let's go back here and get the book.
[109:04.96]Claire's alive.
[109:06.08]That's good to know.
[109:08.76]Give me the book.
[109:11.91]Streamer doesn't care about his fans.
[109:14.89]Wait, this is the wrong... wait.
[109:19.93]Wrong.
[109:22.33]But... but also different.
[109:28.03]Because this is the offices.
[109:29.58]I don't know the safe combination, so...
[109:36.33]Anything else in here?
[109:37.07]Yeah, this is the safe.
[109:38.37]Okay, yeah.
[109:39.73]This is just a quicker way to get through here.
[109:44.17]My meme stocks are dropping?
[109:46.49]Oh, they're not.
[109:47.13]They're doing just fine.
[109:49.27]Look, we were able to... It's alright.
[109:51.45]We were supposed to go through a meme correction.
[109:54.67]Our memes went parabolic in 2018.
[109:56.13]There needs to be a correction.
[109:57.61]Okay, so... This is the book.
[110:09.47]So who... Shit.
[110:11.93]Okay.
[110:12.17]Who needs this book?
[110:14.45]Is somebody in the main hall?
[110:15.41]Let me go look.
[110:16.55]Uh, handgun ammo is in there somewhere.
[110:27.22]Alright.
[110:27.84]Waiting room.
[110:28.98]Safe.
[110:29.32]And then here's a spade door on the other side of the waiting room.
[110:32.54]Let's go look at it.
[110:34.50]But first, let's go find... Okay, is that the Statue of Liberty that needs a book?
[110:40.41]Where's the Burger King guy?
[110:45.16]That's not the Burger King.
[110:52.08]Where is the Burger King guy?
[110:56.51]In here?
[110:56.87]No, this is like the press room.
[111:03.41]No.
[111:08.55]Alright, well let's just go open the... There's so much over here.
[111:13.85]Let's go open the spade door that's over there.
[111:15.34]So we can go back up.
[111:18.28]Save the game.
[111:25.34]I'm back.
[111:25.64]Did you make a new meme yet?
[111:29.06]Yeah.
[111:29.76]You missed it.
[111:31.10]Nobody should repeat it either.
[111:32.24]Because... I mean, come on.
[111:36.90]We're going to keep that one secret for now.
[111:39.76]Here's the spade door over this way.
[111:41.16]Let's go check it out.
[111:43.97]You missed it.
[111:45.45]I'm sorry.
[111:48.35]Okay.
[111:49.11]New place.
[111:54.43]There's somebody on the other side of this door.
[111:57.09]I think.
[112:03.69]Organize items.
[112:06.23]You can discard items that have served their purpose or any other key items with a checkmark by selecting discard.
[112:10.77]So that's it.
[112:11.57]That's all the spade doors.
[112:15.97]I can't do that though.
[112:17.01]I'm just so attached to it already.
[112:20.25]If I get rid of this then I can't have my like three key collection.
[112:33.95]Okay, I had to.
[112:41.24]Alright, we got two ways to go here.
[112:42.74]Let's just try up here.
[112:45.17]Do I have any boards?
[112:46.87]No.
[112:47.89]Are there windows?
[112:51.71]They might be a window, so just take it.
[112:57.60]What's this do?
[112:59.10]Okay, I need a crank.
[113:01.24]I don't have a crank.
[113:05.94]Art room.
[113:10.10]There's the king.
[113:11.68]No, there's the king.
[113:15.53]An article, The Red Stones.
[113:19.38]The ruby that captivated Edward, the black prince, the pearl that the queen of the Nile milked dry, the diamond that led a queen to the guillotine, there is no end to the numbers of tales related to the appeal of jewels.
[113:31.01]The mysterious red stone is some of the latest to sparkle among them.
[113:33.87]Like those other jewels, this one's origin is unknown.
[113:37.71]It's sad that it once adorned a noblewoman's jeweled box and was even dedicated to a wise king.
[113:44.77]this fall this stone that's long been shrouded in legacy will be on display during auction there are sure to be many eager enthusiasts there but dear reader one would do well to approach with care and to read this on another another rainy day shotgun shotgun shotgun shotgun alright we've been going for like another 20 or 30 minutes we good internet fucking normal kind of how are we doing
[114:19.07]Okay?
[114:22.00]Okay.
[114:24.20]We'll just move on.
[114:24.86]We're not going to talk about it.
[114:27.10]But thank you for your patience.
[114:28.66]I really appreciate it.
[114:30.62]There are like 3,600 people here.
[114:32.68]I'm fucking grateful and thankful for your patience.
[114:34.72]Thank you.
[114:36.41]Alright, so let's go.
[114:39.05]Now I can give the Burger King his Burger King late night menu.
[114:46.83]What's that?
[114:47.69]King's hand.
[114:54.49]A piece of plastic shaped like a book.
[114:56.29]It looks like it was being held by a hand.
[114:59.73]So this is bullshit.
[115:01.21]This is just a replica.
[115:03.48]This is a perfect copy.
[115:06.44]Okay.
[115:11.92]Why can't I combine with hand?
[115:15.71]Oh.
[115:17.59]Statue's left arm.
[115:20.99]Fucking... wood.
[115:24.30]Can I just go find a window to pour it up?
[115:36.73]Raid?
[115:37.77]We got a raid?
[115:43.01]Combine it with the book.
[115:43.89]Can you do it from the menu?
[115:49.39]Who just came in with a raid?
[115:59.34]Oh, I did.
[116:00.92]No, it was all sham.
[116:06.92]Sham wow.
[116:08.62]Thanks a lot, dude.
[116:11.10]We haven't talked in a while.
[116:12.32]We've got to fix that.
[116:16.18]We've got to fix that.
[116:16.89]That's something we've got to fix.
[116:18.65]Thank you so much for the raid.
[116:19.69]Hope you had a good stream.
[116:29.01]I thought that they lived.
[116:30.05]Wait, you thought me and all, no, we didn't live together?
[116:37.89]What?
[116:39.17]Alright, but thanks a lot, man.
[116:41.43]Welcome, everybody.
[116:43.11]I'm in the process of, like, just being a play in Resident Evil.
[116:54.48]I can't believe Mark's moving in with Jerma.
[117:00.19]Oh, Diablo II Paladin chapter.
[117:03.99]How's that for a reference to a 2018 parabolic meme?
[117:16.25]I'm getting -2 for that one.
[117:17.55]That's a reference to 2016, which was then revitalized in 2018.
[117:21.77]No, sorry, 2014, which was revitalized in 2016, and I'm referencing a revitalized meme.
[117:27.15]That's how you know our memes are parabolic, and we gotta fucking change something about that.
[117:31.89]Don't sell those anymore.
[117:32.95]Don't buy those.
[117:33.57]Don't buy any more fucking 700,000 games memes.
[117:34.91]They're not gonna be worth anything in like six months.
[117:46.39]Alright, so now I got the scepter.
[117:49.69]Now what the hell are you supposed to do with the scepter?
[117:55.89]Nothing else in here?
[117:56.51]No secrets?
[117:58.11]Okay, let's go.
[118:03.42]A jewel for your scepter.
[118:18.24]I got a jewel.
[118:20.10]Can I put that in the gun?
[118:23.81]Can I, like, add that to my gun to make it look cool?
[118:28.13]Sell it.
[118:28.47]Alright, what's over here?
[118:31.29]We have the crank that's over here.
[118:32.81]Wait, is that a gem?
[118:33.93]Do you put a gem in there?
[118:34.81]No, it's a crank that I don't have.
[118:38.01]Have a laser red dot sight.
[118:41.58]We've gone to the art room.
[118:42.32]There's the waiting room here.
[118:43.88]The safe is in here.
[118:45.74]Let's just keep moving down here.
[118:48.41]I got full bullets.
[118:54.76]Why are you fucking driving?
[118:57.54]That guy, I don't even know how he got there.
[119:01.02]Somebody just GTA'd over a stunt jump and landed into the wall.
[119:03.69]I don't have enough room for this.
[119:18.78]Alright, I got a super herb.
[119:22.12]Hey, I got a superb.
[119:38.67]Helicopter.
[119:41.85]Claire?! !
[119:46.08]Claire, hold on.
[119:47.90]You've been standing at that door for a long time.
[119:50.70]Alright, in the Claire playthrough, do you stand there for 40 minutes?
[119:59.04]Claire, it's so nice to see you.
[120:02.64]How are you doing?
[120:03.18]That helicopter just came out of nowhere.
[120:06.48]One piece.
[120:08.31]I'm guessing you don't have a key in one of those fancy pockets?
[120:11.79]Unfortunately, no.
[120:14.25]Come on, I'm not going to do a joke here.
[120:15.17]What are you doing?
[120:17.22]Grab the gate and go and pretend you're a zombie.
[120:20.26]They had an opportunity to make that joke.
[120:21.94]Any luck with your brother?
[120:23.50]No, not yet.
[120:25.34]Claire, don't lose hope.
[120:27.32]I'm sure we're gonna find him.
[120:33.55]Dammit.
[120:33.87]You know what that means?
[120:36.87]Yeah.
[120:38.69]Dinner time.
[120:42.82]Claire, I think you should go.
[120:43.94]Don't worry about me, Leon.
[120:45.60]You take care of yourself.
[120:49.68]I can't really climb that.
[120:53.88]Marvin?
[120:54.44]I don't think Marvin's alive.
[120:56.66]Alright, cutting tool.
[121:19.03]God damn it!
[121:21.63]The stupid wooden boards!
[121:23.69]I agree.
[121:24.75]Can I just board this up?
[121:31.38]This ammo too.
[121:33.06]More boards!
[121:54.80]I don't need the boards.
[121:56.90]This is a boardless playthrough.
[122:01.95]This is a real board playthrough.
[122:03.37]I know, yeah.
[122:04.83]Lots of action going on.
[122:10.45]Headshots only.
[122:11.13]Got it.
[122:28.31]Give me the knife.
[122:29.05]What the fuck?
[122:29.57]I thought he was... Honest to God, how many times do I have to shoot you in the head?
[122:36.41]Fucking bozo.
[122:38.71]Alright, uh, so that is... That's good.
[122:43.56]Back to... There's places where the guy couldn't cut before.
[122:47.78]I gotta go back to the main room, because I gotta see if that guy's okay.
[122:53.66]So we gotta go... Straight right.
[122:58.06]Fuck!
[123:06.77]I screwed it up!
[123:08.99]I need to heal.
[123:10.79]Do I care about the knife?
[123:17.16]Give me the knife.
[123:17.58]Where'd the knife go?
[123:19.24]Why's the knife gone?
[123:21.52]The knife just disappeared.
[123:22.60]Why?
[123:32.35]Okay, leave.
[123:34.73]I'm just gonna- I'm no more killing people.
[123:36.55]Just gotta go.
[123:43.99]All the way down, straight.
[123:52.13]It's okay.
[123:59.32]Shit!
[124:00.60]This is blocked!
[124:03.15]Oh, god damn it.
[124:04.03]Okay, I don't have the fuse.
[124:05.31]Oh, I gotta go back through the press room?
[124:07.83]Back up the stairs?
[124:16.79]Can I... Hold on.
[124:18.87]Uh... I haven't gone through there yet.
[124:25.26]No, I don't want any boards!
[124:39.67]Okay, this way.
[124:45.41]And then I can bang a left.
[124:50.41]No, back up the-
[125:01.41]Turn light back on, why did I turn it off?
[125:13.06]change door oh okay okay out here take a left I was supposed to take a left it doesn't matter I can go in either one of these doors
[125:43.86]Chained door.
[125:48.04]No, the chained one is on the other side of this door.
[125:52.15]Oh, Jeremy.
[125:54.13]Sometimes I wish that you didn't have an eighth grade fucking brain.
[126:16.74]No!
[126:17.02]Get him off!
[126:21.06]Okay.
[126:22.56]So that takes us to take a right and then cut the door down.
[126:25.19]This is the east office.
[126:41.76]Let's take a look around.
[126:42.56]Let's explore.
[126:47.58]What the fuck is that noise?
[126:54.52]Flash grenade.
[126:57.27]Equip on the inventory screen to use.
[126:58.75]Guaranteed to daze and stun enemies within its effective radius.
[127:04.15]Can be used to counter attack when you are caught by an enemy.
[127:06.61]That's great.
[127:07.01]Okay, so you just left bumper and then right trigger is throw it.
[127:14.07]Window!
[127:23.08]Alright, we're good.
[127:23.52]I got herb, I got room for it.
[127:30.19]What else is in here?
[127:30.91]Let's take a quick look.
[127:31.73]Got a bloated window now.
[127:35.37]He can't get through it.
[127:37.19]Watch out for the glass.
[127:38.47]There's probably... Oh, it's over here.
[127:41.06]More gunpowder.
[128:05.12]Electrical part.
[128:19.26]Mushroom.
[128:19.60]There's so many important items in here that I can't take.
[128:25.48]High-grade gunpowder.
[128:27.04]Shit!
[128:28.06]Can I...
[128:35.70]I have to come back here and just pick everything up.
[128:37.86]All these are incredibly important items.
[128:47.26]I need the fuse to open the door to unlock here.
[128:49.92]So what am I going to replace or get rid of?
[128:52.26]I love this game.
[128:53.88]Alright.
[128:55.06]I'm fine.
[128:55.62]I can't combine this.
[128:57.13]I can't... I have to throw the flashbang at somebody.
[129:02.41]Consume the herb?
[129:06.99]I know I gotta take the fuse, but what do I gotta replace the fuse with?
[129:09.11]Just so I fucking put the herb up my nose?
[129:15.15]I could throw the flashbang, but that's not worth it.
[129:21.95]Or I could go to stor- where's the storage box here?
[129:24.87]Watchman's room?
[129:26.23]Yeah, just hold on.
[129:26.97]Hold tight, everybody.
[129:29.16]Because then I can- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah?
[129:34.52]Yeah?
[129:34.72]I think so?
[129:35.66]Yeah?
[129:40.85]Is there a storage box in here?
[129:48.43]No?
[129:48.81]Yeah?
[129:50.41]No.
[129:57.27]Okay, I'll take these.
[130:06.20]Hold on.
[130:10.60]Where's that storage box?
[130:13.41]Yeah?
[130:16.99]Press room?
[130:17.55]Bathroom?
[130:18.69]Press room?
[130:26.27]I know there's one on the floor, isn't there?
[130:32.88]Where's that storage box?
[130:35.36]No, it's not in here.
[130:36.44]Is it in here?
[130:37.22]Yeah?
[130:37.50]No.
[130:39.24]No.
[130:42.24]Is it not marked?
[130:43.44]Oh, I don't think... Are all of them marked?
[130:46.83]Oh, fuck, it isn't.
[130:47.59]No.
[130:47.93]Yeah, you're right.
[130:49.01]There's one here.
[130:49.83]That's where I'm thinking of.
[130:51.07]We're not there.
[130:59.46]I could try to go back upstairs.
[131:04.24]Or I'm just gonna... You know what?
[131:05.86]Fuck it.
[131:08.86]Oh, this is a lot.
[131:09.86]This is a lot to have to think about because I need to... I have to just eat the herb.
[131:15.24]Look, I've been doing... I've been playing so well.
[131:17.53]The game has given me enough healing to heal.
[131:20.53]And I'm just like throwing it right back in their face with such lines as, I don't need this shit.
[131:25.41]And it's clear that I've already eaten.
[131:27.69]So I'm not hungry.
[131:30.33]Let's go.
[131:35.22]Okay.
[132:07.35]Don't care.
[132:07.87]Let's go.
[132:22.96]Don't need it.
[132:24.42]Just get hit one less time.
[132:25.90]Don't you guys understand?
[132:28.59]Just don't get hit one extra time and that doesn't matter.
[132:31.13]Alright, where you at?
[132:33.23]How you doing?
[132:37.29]I can hear him.
[132:38.15]He's a zombie now, isn't he?
[132:44.53]Is somebody in here?
[132:45.23]No, still alive.
[132:49.87]Alright, okay.
[132:55.68]Alright, that's fine.
[132:57.88]Storage box.
[133:02.83]Streamer wets himself on stream.
[133:05.45]Oh, you would know if that were the case.
[133:06.57]Alright, I'm gonna store the ruby, bring the keycard, store the... Look at all these things I have in here.
[133:14.66]I could just use the gunpowder or... I could store the flash grenade.
[133:31.92]Let me go get... I just burped so fucking loud.
[133:35.13]That's why I don't do face cam.
[133:37.05]That's why I don't have mic ever.
[133:42.46]Alright.
[133:43.26]I want another water.
[133:44.00]I'll be right back.
[137:24.54]Okay, it's so dark in here.
[137:27.64]I don't like how dark it is in here.
[137:31.30]Can I turn the lights back on?
[137:37.48]What's going on?
[137:41.88]All the hearts?
[137:43.50]Why is everybody doing hearts?
[137:47.76]Hey, thanks.
[137:53.91]Any particular reason?
[137:57.29]Show my pants.
[137:59.79]What's wrong with my pants?
[138:01.76]They're just regular pants.
[138:05.86]Because you peed yourself and we feel bad.
[138:07.66]Alright, I don't need this.
[138:14.64]I want to get the shotgun.
[138:16.60]But then I'm going to have a permanent shotgun.
[138:18.66]What am I supposed to do?
[138:22.93]I have to think about this stuff because then what am I supposed to do?
[138:26.23]Shotgun is going to go here.
[138:27.76]Shotgun bullets.
[138:31.54]When do I get the inventory upgrade?
[138:39.18]So, alright.
[138:43.45]This is a very... I like this a lot.
[138:46.39]Okay.
[138:48.39]So we got press room.
[138:51.35]Bathroom, I have, where do I, where are the wire cutters?
[138:56.05]Locked door, chained door, so I could go back here.
[138:58.67]Let me see the, uh, let me see the other floors.
[139:06.97]Any other, okay, so I got one more chained door to cut, right?
[139:11.89]And then that will be done.
[139:13.63]So let me go open this chained door.
[139:17.10]Uh, well, uh, Herbert gives five community subs.
[139:19.26]Thanks a lot, Herbert.
[139:21.89]Thank you, all of you.
[139:22.87]You guys are fucking incredible.
[139:23.83]Thank you.
[139:28.13]You guys are fucking unbelievable to me.
[139:30.39]Thank you so much.
[139:32.45]Chained door.
[139:37.99]Because then I can get rid of that.
[139:42.06]Yeah, let me just go get rid of the pliers.
[139:45.18]Because I'm not going to need them more after this.
[139:46.74]Let me set a waypoint right here.
[139:49.22]So straight through the reception...
[139:50.98]Bang a right.
[139:52.25]Straight through a reception.
[139:53.73]Straight through the door.
[139:54.71]Bang a right.
[139:55.63]Operations room.
[139:56.37]Chain door.
[140:00.51]Okay.
[140:06.62]Straight through.
[140:07.20]And then that brings us to here.
[140:10.54]And then we go straight all the way down to the right.
[140:12.30]Do I have any boards?
[140:12.80]I don't have any boards, so... Operations room.
[140:15.48]Straight all the way down.
[140:25.09]The windows are now open.
[140:25.89]Now I understand why I should have boarded those windows.
[140:33.33]Damn it!
[140:34.84]Spin?
[140:35.24]Do I spin?
[140:39.26]Okay.
[140:48.19]Shit.
[140:50.35]Why are there so many of them?
[140:55.44]There's like 300 enemies against me right now.
[140:57.04]Alright.
[140:58.03]Chain.
[140:58.33]This'll be it.
[140:59.03]I'm gonna use it.
[140:59.65]That's the last door that's locked up.
[141:06.01]Yup.
[141:06.37]Okay.
[141:07.33]Goodbye.
[141:08.25]Thank you.
[141:08.71]It was very nice of you to be here and give me the checkbox, but now you're gone.
[141:12.67]What's in here?
[141:15.69]Electric jag- uh, electronic gadget.
[141:24.38]I said I was gonna get a water and I just got another cup of coffee.
[141:29.56]I think he might be deranged.
[141:31.61]Alright, a medium sized electronic gadget.
[141:33.67]Let's examine it.
[141:38.93]Some sort of electronic gadget.
[141:46.80]Needs a battery.
[141:48.78]A detonator for C4 explosive.
[141:50.32]It's missing a battery.
[141:54.13]Okay.
[141:54.35]So I'm going to store this until I find a battery for it.
[141:59.53]Lobster room.
[142:03.79]How am I doing on health?
[142:07.43]Fine.
[142:08.61]I'm fine.
[142:12.41]What the fuck is that?
[142:33.35]I don't... What is that?
[142:36.07]Oh, I unlocked it?
[142:36.97]There's a flashbang in there.
[142:43.01]Okay, locker, terminal... I got the electronic gadget.
[142:47.82]It's a flash grenade.
[142:53.66]All headshots.
[142:55.02]I'm sorry, but when I went downstairs to get some water and a coffee...
[143:00.14]I was immediately back-seated.
[143:02.22]Like, it was... Etalyx was waiting at the bottom of the stairs for me.
[143:05.62]He was sitting there going like this, waiting.
[143:06.80]He knew I was going to take a break.
[143:08.42]And when I opened up the door, I looked over.
[143:09.56]He said, it's bad if you just shoot heads.
[143:12.42]He said, shoot the limbs and stuff.
[143:13.96]It'll help you.
[143:14.50]And I'm like, oh, okay.
[143:16.24]How long have you been standing there for?
[143:18.26]He's like, the whole time.
[143:19.08]I've just been watching on my phone, waiting for you to come down.
[143:20.73]I'm like, alright.
[143:23.27]Thanks, man.
[143:23.65]Alright, we got the records room here.
[143:28.23]Let's go in.
[143:40.15]I don't have that key.
[143:45.20]Damn it, I fucking missed him.
[143:50.96]Heart door.
[143:55.24]Sink.
[143:56.59]Locker terminal.
[143:57.41]Weapons locker.
[143:57.97]Ah, the weapons locker.
[143:58.93]But I don't have enough room for that.
[144:01.27]What's on the table?
[144:07.92]Nothing else in here that I need.
[144:08.88]I got the electronic equipment.
[144:12.34]I have just screwed myself so much.
[144:20.25]Die!
[144:20.85]Why did you?
[144:29.02]Ah, okay.
[144:30.60]Weapons locker.
[144:31.40]We're gonna jump through here.
[144:36.76]And I know I'm a compulsive map viewer.
[144:40.54]I know I am.
[144:41.18]But I have to.
[144:43.06]Straight, left, left.
[144:48.72]What?
[144:49.48]Was it a dud?
[145:10.70]Alright, I got the keycard.
[145:14.20]I can finally get rid of this now.
[145:21.13]Open the locker.
[145:22.45]Give me the shotgun.
[145:23.17]Give me the shotgun shells.
[145:26.81]Nice.
[145:27.73]W870.

[145:31.13]Change weapons.
[145:32.39]So it's down.
[145:33.20]Let's go ahead and load it.
[145:38.08]Fucking asshole.
[145:38.82]What are you doing in here?
[145:45.92]What is going on?
[145:46.88]Alright.
[146:07.49]I got the shotgun.
[146:10.65]I'm fucking, like, itchy and stuff.
[146:12.07]That's how you know shit's getting all actually wild.
[146:15.49]Okay.
[146:17.62]I need to go back here to the east office to get myself the handle and some gunpowder and then the valve goes into the valve unit which was over okay so we got to turn around through west office so through the door to turn around through door out the other door into the main hall save game
[146:50.47]You're not going to get up, are you?
[147:01.38]How you doing?
[147:01.80]You good?
[147:02.10]Hey, dude, I found a shotgun.
[147:04.26]We're going to be just fine.
[147:12.07]Okay.
[147:13.03]So there, I got shotgun shells in here.
[147:15.37]Get them out.
[147:18.62]Wooden board, electronic device, store it.
[147:21.14]Wooden board, store it.
[147:23.18]Gunpowder.
[147:24.42]First aid spray, maybe.
[147:25.62]No.
[147:26.14]Red herb, no.
[147:29.46]Red jewel, maybe, is what I'll need here soon.
[147:31.83]I don't know.
[147:34.39]Yo, shave tonight.
[147:36.19]I'm not shaving ever again.
[147:42.17]Save it.
[147:44.37]This will take us out there.
[147:45.61]I can get the valve now, which is just straight through.
[147:48.47]Go in, grab valve.
[147:55.65]Is there an enemy in here?
[147:57.17]No.
[148:00.57]Can only hold six bullets in the shotgun.
[148:02.21]That's fine.
[148:04.71]This thing is broken.
[148:11.33]No, never mind.
[148:16.15]Let's bring this in here.
[148:17.15]Give me the valve.
[148:19.59]Which is in this office.
[148:20.61]Is somebody in the office?
[148:21.55]I think there might be somebody lying on the ground.
[148:23.01]No.
[148:25.83]Okay.
[148:26.81]Round handle.
[148:27.83]Take it.
[148:30.41]Super gunpowder.
[148:31.39]Take it.
[148:36.12]Now, where was that valve?
[148:42.88]The valve was...
[148:49.61]Jack.
[148:50.41]Valve.
[148:51.57]Second floor.
[148:54.03]So we gotta go main hall.
[148:55.15]Is there a way I can get up from here?
[148:57.99]A fire escape, maybe?
[149:00.56]No, that's too far away.
[149:01.74]We gotta go main hall.
[149:03.86]So does it go back to where I was?
[149:06.30]Save game.
[149:06.80]Am I doing a joke, or am I just acting weird?
[149:11.44]What do you think?
[149:17.53]The way he's narrating everything is very YouTube streamer.
[149:25.57]Am I acting weird?
[149:35.08]Am I?
[149:35.38]I can't even tell.
[149:44.97]let's go back to the main it's because I'm saying everything I'm doing is that the issue it's very tuber like what you're doing okay so get the main hall and then I'm gonna activate this device that's the problem I guess
[150:12.43]Okay.
[150:13.79]I need to use all this, but I'm going to store the gunpowder.
[150:16.32]I have a lot of gunpowder.
[150:18.38]I'm doing it again.
[150:19.87]But I would...
[150:57.13]How do I get over there?
[151:01.48]Hey, you're doing great.
[151:02.44]Hey, thanks.
[151:07.16]Is there a way I gotta go up?
[151:08.77]Can I climb up?
[151:10.55]I don't know.
[151:13.39]Who has any damn idea?
[151:26.88]valve I'm on the third floor now wrong floor I'm gonna go up and around here and then down which will take me okay so I gotta go around through the
[151:57.34]Bullets.
[152:04.17]Don't wanna miss anything, though.
[152:05.99]Like that.
[152:06.69]Some.
[152:07.29]Guys.
[152:08.05]Scribblings.
[152:11.55]Damn those corporate assholes, they cut me off after all I've done for them, but that's... If that's how it's gonna be, so be it.
[152:18.08]I'm gonna have a little fun of my own as the world goes to shit.
[152:20.38]I boarded all those filthy pigs up in a steel pen.
[152:25.62]And set some C4.
[152:26.60]All I gotta do is detonate it.
[152:29.02]Okay.
[152:30.45]It's no fun if it's over too soon, so maybe I'll give that one raving loon something to really squeal about.
[152:36.69]Yeah, maybe I'll give him a little toy and tell him, kill the guy next to you and I'll spare the others.
[152:41.35]I wonder what he'll do.
[152:43.63]You yell about justice and pride, but how many times did you go against me, your own superior?
[152:49.29]Yeah, you're such a good cop, so good you had to die.
[152:52.37]This is fun.
[152:53.43]I need some music for this.
[152:57.39]Okay, so there's people locked up somewhere?
[152:59.75]What the hell is this?
[153:03.19]Hip pouch.
[153:07.17]That's exactly what I wanted.
[153:11.59]Thank god.
[153:14.85]So that's how you increase your size.
[153:18.19]Got it.
[153:24.50]Grandfather clock.
[153:34.71]Nothing else over here.
[153:35.57]I don't want to miss anything.
[153:40.23]So what is this going to lead to?
[153:43.08]This will lead out to where I want to go.
[153:44.60]Do I have any boards?
[153:57.98]No.
[153:59.68]Unnecessary though.
[154:05.38]Then I could be able to take the stairs down, and there's the valve.
[154:11.54]Interesting.
[154:11.94]I still don't know the combination of this shit.
[154:27.34]Dick.
[154:30.76]I have to shoot this guy.
[154:32.16]There's nowhere for me to get out of here.
[154:35.34]Alright, I'm stooping into the heads.
[154:42.97]I'm only shooting in heads.
[154:56.29]Okay, so I could heal full.
[155:00.38]I'm not supposed to have these.
[155:01.42]I'm not supposed to take this right now.
[155:10.07]I shot him in the leg and the stomach and the groin and I went against my own rule of headshots only and I got bit.
[155:17.65]This is your fault.
[155:19.05]You told me to do this.
[155:26.18]Shoot him in the leg more than one time.
[155:27.50]That's not what you said.
[155:28.74]You said shoot him in the leg.
[155:29.84]And I said, okay.
[155:30.64]Alright.
[155:34.68]Valve is back here.
[155:36.28]There's bullets over here though.
[155:43.64]Only a Sith.
[155:44.74]Only a Sith deals in absolutes, right?
[155:46.34]That's what you would say in that accent.
[155:52.17]Let's turn it off.
[156:01.71]Still... I feel like I'm missing some things with the locker combinations.
[156:07.76]But it's all good.
[156:08.42]Alright.
[156:08.92]Anything I can do in here...
[156:13.50]Hot water tank.
[156:20.12]Pretty cool.
[156:24.78]Dead or alive?
[156:40.30]Yeah.
[156:42.25]Dead!
[156:43.46]That's fine.
[156:47.05]What is this?
[156:47.49]Gunpowder.
[156:48.01]I'm going to combine it.
[156:54.35]I have so much handgun bullets.
[156:57.49]Might as well do it.
[156:58.33]Just on one of them, right?
[157:12.51]Giving me a lot of ammunition here.
[157:21.47]So this is bringing me back here.
[157:22.89]There's a door here and a door there.
[157:30.84]It's one of those- Shh!
[157:31.86]Don't- Walk silently!
[157:35.64]What?!
[157:35.88]He just did like a Street Fighter move to me!
[157:38.80]Oh my god!
[157:57.75]I have no health now.
[157:59.79]Oh, shit.
[158:00.61]Whatever.
[158:00.91]I don't think there's anybody in here.
[158:07.99]Keeping the shotgun out, though.
[158:09.13]I'm not going to let that happen again.
[158:13.36]Flashbang.
[158:21.68]Dart.
[158:22.20]Throwing dart.
[158:22.80]Hold on.
[158:31.36]First aid spray.
[158:32.06]Alright, there's an office in here.
[158:37.76]I'm not going to activate that computer just yet.
[158:42.04]What's in the office?
[158:46.11]Internal memo.
[158:48.13]Oh, office supply internal relocation notice.
[158:51.01]Heat resistant three number combination safe.
[158:54.71]Moved from Star's office to West office first floor.
[158:59.87]Right?
[159:00.45]So West Office.
[159:02.57]The combo is left 9, right 15, left 7.
[159:04.57]9, 15, 7.
[159:04.63]9, 15.
[159:05.11]Okay, please change the combo as soon as possible.
[159:12.38]It's a combination of the safe downstairs.
[159:15.90]Very cool.
[159:20.48]You guys need to... And there's the battery.
[159:23.94]That goes into that unit.
[159:27.85]Alright, nice.
[159:28.57]Making progress here.
[159:31.60]Plenty of bullets.
[159:33.50]Some red herb.
[159:37.60]Out of space.
[159:42.34]No, I'm not.
[159:50.76]I have so many of those, it's worth doing at least once, maybe.
[159:55.92]Throw away the gunpowder.
[159:58.46]Now that's not correct.
[160:02.48]Matilda?
[160:03.04]Wait, wait.
[160:04.44]Do I have a CD or a thumb drive or something I need?
[160:10.20]What about the battery?
[160:14.78]Fail to authenticate account.
[160:19.06]I need a USB dongle to unlock this door.
[160:27.23]Looks like a different gun.
[160:29.93]Okay.
[160:32.63]back out to where the liquor is lightning hawk times three so I got a battery and I got the safe combination to the door to the safe down here so we need to go down which is west office safe is back here it's for that so I'm gonna get out here and back downstairs just to make our way to the west office
[161:01.08]Or I could... Let me just keep going.
[161:02.44]No, I need to get a save point.
[161:08.15]Behind you.
[161:11.77]Stop doing that.
[161:14.47]You know how fucking neurotic I am?
[161:15.81]Don't do that.
[161:17.81]Don't do that to me.
[162:25.64]I'll come back here after I go back.
[162:39.09]Right in the fucking brain!
[162:47.00]What the fuck, he's still alive, no!
[162:50.97]Die, die, die, die, die, die!
[163:12.14]What?!
[163:13.68]What was that?!
[163:16.76]What was that clown move?!
[163:33.41]He just fucking threw himself into the corner!
[163:43.97]Did he come through the door?
[163:44.73]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[163:54.77]He can't go through there, right?
[163:55.75]Does the door eventually explode?
[164:05.98]Okay.
[164:07.06]So this is... I need the horse.
[164:15.83]It's this, right here, right here.
[164:17.23]No, where is it?
[164:18.55]This one.
[164:20.17]So it's Pisces... fish crab... vase, I guess.
[164:38.90]Give me the disk.
[164:39.54]It fits.
[164:46.77]I really thought three shotgun blasts point-blank would do it.
[164:50.45]Apparently not, and there's a police station up the floor map.
[164:54.37]Nice.
[164:56.51]I can't go in the linen room.
[165:00.22]This is going to take me back to the library and then back down to the main hall.
[165:05.72]Okay, so I did everything I could do there.
[165:10.42]Fish, crab?
[165:11.16]No.
[165:11.52]Fish, then crab, then vase.
[165:16.04]I'm gonna put this back in there, and then we'll go from there.
[165:23.92]He's not gonna be, like, behind this door, right?
[165:27.71]They are, though.
[165:29.75]Take a right!
[165:36.35]Here we are.
[165:38.43]Beautiful!
[165:43.78]Save point.
[165:51.42]Stick it in there.
[165:58.85]You're in Castle Cainhurst.
[166:00.93]That's a pretty great reference, actually.
[166:06.74]So.
[166:08.84]Gunpowder, gunpowder, the jewels.
[166:12.24]Let me put the battery in the detonator.
[166:15.84]Uh...
[166:24.32]Detonator.
[166:27.48]Examine.
[166:27.98]It looks like it's just for C4.
[166:36.46]Red herb.
[166:37.54]No blue herbs.
[166:40.02]Alright, so I got gunpowder, and then I got high-grade gunpowder.
[166:43.78]Should I do one and two?
[166:45.10]What was it?
[166:49.38]What are you doing?
[166:54.20]What are you guys doing?
[166:56.46]I have to increase the visibility in my room.
[166:58.08]Hold on.
[167:04.00]Okay, that's better.
[167:06.54]Every hour I have to increase the visibility because the sun's going down.
[167:12.15]Alright, BB pistol, BY shotgun.
[167:17.05]Let's do a... Let's make a... Let's do a BY.
[167:20.93]Let's make some shotgun shells.
[167:21.97]Why not?
[167:22.23]Might as well use them
[167:31.45]I could do it again.
[167:31.93]I'm gonna do it again.
[167:40.44]I'm one of those people that will never use these.
[167:42.40]I just won't.
[167:45.42]I just, I'm so obsessed with... Oh, don't use them.
[167:52.85]You're gonna need them later.
[167:53.65]Alright.
[167:58.27]Uh, that's $100 from Lucranda.
[168:03.37]100 bucks.
[168:05.09]Thank you, Lucrondo.
[168:07.25]What's going on, Jerma?
[168:08.23]I hope to see you playing Fortnite tonight with Thanos.
[168:10.77]I know I'd want to be there.
[168:13.03]Much love.
[168:14.73]That's not going to happen.
[168:16.01]I'm not going to play Fortnite ever.
[168:18.09]For any reason.
[168:20.19]But I appreciate the... Thanos is in Fortnite.
[168:23.59]Sometimes I forget about that.
[168:27.89]Why?
[168:28.09]Why?
[168:31.58]but uh that's thank you so much for your hundred fucking dollars I really appreciate it but uh unfortunately you're not ever going to see me play Fortnite sorry to say why yeah why is he in Fortnite and a second about why is John wick in Fortnite just wait Mickey Mouse will be in Fortnite in six months
[168:58.01]Uh, I'm gonna hold on to these because at least, yeah, because I want to save for the machine gun.
[169:05.47]But, should I carry the detonator around with me?
[169:08.64]That's something I don't think I want to do.
[169:12.26]Take the first aid spray.
[169:13.40]The jewel, maybe?
[169:15.30]I don't know, maybe I'll need it eventually here.
[169:16.96]No, it'll be in Fortnite.
[169:22.55]Or, like, Donald Duck or somebody will be in Fortnite.
[169:28.16]Save it.
[169:32.90]Default skin.
[169:36.94]So now let me take a little bit of inventory and figure out what the hell I want to do here because now I have some options.
[169:41.35]So I got the West Office is number one because I have the key, the code to the save.
[169:52.21]So let's do that right now.
[169:56.21]What was it?
[169:57.33]9, 15, something else?
[170:06.65]9, 15, uh... Somebody's in the office.
[170:13.27]I'm gonna have to blow this guy's head up with a shotgun, aren't I?
[170:16.11]No, I'm not.
[170:22.50]Shit!
[170:36.53]Are you watching?
[170:37.07]I hope you're watching.
[170:37.73]I got two on me!
[170:53.76]Am I dead?
[170:56.92]No, I just saved it.
[171:01.88]Kill me.
[171:03.10]Load game.
[171:05.97]What?
[171:07.31]There's this one right here.
[171:18.46]Use the shotgun?
[171:19.12]No, I can't.
[171:20.08]I need to only use that for scary enemies.
[171:32.05]Save scum.
[171:32.79]Oh, if I have the opportunity to, I have to, man.
[171:42.03]Don't get me angry in a video game like this.
[171:44.61]Alright, 9.
[171:45.37]It was left 9.
[171:49.70]Right 15.
[171:55.98]Left what?
[171:57.08]Left... Left, um... Don't be fake numbers.
[172:01.69]4, 5, 6, 7.
[172:14.59]Guys, it didn't tell me to go to those numbers.
[172:17.05]It told me to turn the dials that amount of times.
[172:20.83]Big brain up here.
[172:22.41]Got a big brain up here.
[172:23.69]Nice.
[172:29.42]Alright, I got that.
[172:30.26]Let's head back to the other room.
[172:32.30]Excuse me.
[172:35.40]So now I'm kind of... It's open now.
[172:37.24]I'm not sure what else to do after that.
[172:39.61]Maybe explore a place that I haven't gone before.
[172:48.63]Who puts a pouch in a safe?
[172:51.49]Some fucking dummy.
[172:55.95]Okay.
[173:00.63]Opening locks and talking about cocks.
[173:02.80]That's a great... Actually, that is a great title for this stream.
[173:10.80]Now.
[173:12.34]Got an extra pouch.
[173:16.18]Sink.
[173:17.60]I do have the detonator.
[173:21.26]Hmm.
[173:24.45]The detonator was up.
[173:26.67]What room was that in?
[173:28.15]Safe.
[173:30.29]Jack.
[173:32.03]A hundred.
[173:33.01]A hundred dollars.
[173:38.66]Again.
[173:40.42]First LaCronda.
[173:42.06]No.
[173:43.28]G-Bot.
[173:43.98]H-D-H-F-E.
[173:46.93]Thank you for the $100.
[173:52.61]Thank you.
[173:52.99]It says, hey, Jerma, if you got gender-bent into a female version of you, would you mess with Etalyx and seduce him?
[173:57.62]What?
[174:00.02]What?
[174:00.22]I don't think I would do that.
[174:07.73]I don't think I would do that to Etalyx.
[174:18.51]But thank you so much for the $100.
[174:20.65]I really appreciate it.
[174:32.88]Imagine giving money to this evil man.
[174:36.20]What are you talking about?
[174:46.39]But anyways.
[174:50.29]I really appreciate the hundred fucking dollars.
[174:51.75]You know what?
[174:54.79]You know what would happen if I... I'll give you an answer.
[174:57.78]If that would have happened... I would just be the same person I am right now.
[175:03.86]What would change?
[175:05.58]Not much.
[175:05.90]Alright, save it.
[175:17.09]Alright, so...
[175:19.99]I want to go back to the detonator room, which is up here.
[175:27.20]Right?
[175:29.62]Combat knife in there.
[175:30.88]We've got pirate room.
[175:34.16]Crank handle slot.
[175:37.87]I have not been in this area, but I don't know if I can.
[175:40.73]I need the crank to get up here.
[175:42.81]So I can't really go over here.
[175:47.27]I feel like I have to do something with this.
[175:51.65]Or maybe up another floor?
[175:54.11]Dial lock?
[175:57.83]Where do I bring the detonator?
[176:01.07]What was that message where the guy was like, I've done it, I've locked them away, and I need a battery?
[176:05.01]I don't know.
[176:07.59]I'm going to go upstairs.
[176:11.56]That's where I feel like I need to be.
[176:19.32]Shower.
[176:22.55]Let's go up.
[176:30.13]How we doing on ammo?
[176:30.97]Good?
[176:32.86]Yes, sir.
[176:34.04]I have lots of ammo.
[176:36.12]So, we gotta go up, up, up, up, up.
[176:40.84]Shut up.
[176:41.18]Shut up.
[176:41.40]You're not even fucking funny.
[176:42.62]You're stupid.
[176:43.40]Nice.
[176:45.74]I deserve it for fucking just trying to make a joke for no reason.
[176:49.38]No fucking reason.
[176:50.68]I don't know what the hell that was.
[176:51.74]Somebody was... I was trying to make a new 2019 meme.
[176:55.34]I don't know what I was doing.
[176:56.42]I can't tell you why I did that.
[176:59.90]You gotta be very careful in this game.
[177:01.42]And you can't just do that.
[177:02.28]I don't know what the hell I was doing.
[177:10.99]Alright, hold on.
[177:19.93]Where do I put this detonator?
[177:21.45]It was this room.
[177:25.35]It's dead.
[177:29.83]Right here?
[177:35.80]Right here.
[177:38.14]Alright, detonator, use.
[177:41.70]Confirm.
[177:43.73]That's got 10 seconds.
[177:44.61]Does the whole room explode?
[177:51.71]Or just... That angered somebody.
[178:06.98]Got it.
[178:07.50]Final medallion.
[178:10.92]Wait, what's on the other side?
[178:11.74]Okay.
[178:20.58]I just need to look at the thing.
[178:23.20]It is... Face, Arrow, Snake.
[178:28.56]Face, Ar- Arrow... Snake.
[178:37.97]It's the blind ones, be quiet!
[178:41.85]That doesn't make any sense.
[178:44.51]Alright, I got them all.
[178:46.02]Nothing else in here.
[178:46.74]I gotta go out right down into the main hall.
[178:54.24]Just one.
[178:54.62]Don't have to worry about it.
[178:55.68]Don't have to freak out about it.
[178:56.78]Just gonna spray it.
[179:01.41]I can't believe that there's one of those things in here.
[179:14.74]Where's the exit?
[179:20.71]Shotgun!
[179:21.05]Give me the shotgun!
[179:33.52]Will you fucking die?
[179:36.90]Is it dead?
[179:37.34]Does it get up?
[179:39.10]It doesn't get up, does it?
[179:44.36]Get the fuck out of my way.
[179:45.24]I don't even care.
[179:53.64]I just started the... I just sang that song from Sia.
[179:58.92]The chandelier one.
[179:59.74]Let go!
[180:07.45]We're not gonna go that way.
[180:09.29]Uh...
[180:19.97]I need this.
[180:22.75]No.
[180:23.05]Why would you have anything like that in the game?
[180:25.45]Of all the things to have in the game.
[180:30.75]Come on.
[180:31.75]That's horseshit.
[180:35.37]So we gotta go down and then back to the main hall.
[180:37.34]We should just go this way, right?
[180:46.06]Main hall is just around the corner and back.
[180:49.97]Although, where's this combat knife?
[180:55.36]I don't... I don't care.
[180:56.26]Let's save it first, because something's gonna happen.
[181:04.22]The boss is gonna drop down through the middle of the thing.
[181:09.49]Nemesis is gonna show up, and I'm gonna scream.
[181:12.27]You're gonna get a YouTuber scream.
[181:13.93]You already have, like, five of them.
[181:15.03]And I sang like a YouTuber.
[181:16.25]I'm like, oh, it's something attacking him.
[181:17.51]YouTuber sound.
[181:22.34]Alright.
[181:33.12]Let's put it in.
[181:36.30]He still alive?
[181:39.17]He'll get up after this and I'll have to shoot him.
[181:43.57]Alright, put a three in.
[181:45.63]One, two, three.
[181:46.71]One, two, three.
[181:49.33]One, two, three.
[181:50.29]One, two, three.
[181:51.15]I can't get it out of my head.
[181:53.54]One, two, three.
[181:54.56]One, two, three.
[182:02.08]Is he gonna get up?
[182:04.62]I don't think so.
[182:09.00]He probably will.
[182:09.56]It's gonna be a cutscene right here.
[182:20.99]So it goes underground.
[182:22.91]Huh.
[182:23.87]That's it.
[182:24.99]That's our way out.
[182:26.53]Lieutenant Branagh!
[182:28.11]Marvin!
[182:31.30]It's time to go.
[182:31.88]Hey, Marvin.
[182:37.94]We need to get you to a hospital right now.
[182:40.36]A hospital?
[182:40.98]I think that's gonna help.
[182:43.70]Save yourself.
[182:44.86]You need to shoot me.
[182:46.42]Go!
[182:48.64]Look, we can still make it out of here together.
[182:50.80]Just give me...
[182:53.40]It's too late.
[182:57.82]I tried, Leon.
[183:00.83]But I couldn't stop it.
[183:04.23]We can't let this thing spread.
[183:07.47]It's on you now.
[183:10.19]Just go.
[183:10.85]I understand.
[183:18.23]Jerm is crying.
[183:37.54]I won't let you down Marvin.
[183:55.45]What a fucking actor!
[184:02.96]OK.
[184:07.15]Gunpowder, got it.
[184:07.77]This is the new little save point here.
[184:22.72]No, I need health.
[184:30.38]Heartless streamer tries to make himself cry.
[184:34.26]What you meant to say was incredibly talented actor shows his skill and craft on stream.
[184:43.55]Nowhere I wear in the secret room and there's a T bar handle slot over here.
[184:49.55]I don't have a T bar.
[184:50.55]I don't have a valve.
[184:57.35]What about the gem?
[184:58.09]I'm just carrying the gem around still, for some reason.
[185:02.64]Let's go.
[185:06.81]Bring the Coil of El.
[185:29.05]Take out the gun.
[185:41.65]Two ways to go.
[185:43.01]Let's go down.
[185:52.90]Floor.
[185:54.52]Hand grenade.
[185:55.32]Equip on the... This is gonna kill me.
[185:59.76]This is going to bounce back and hit me in the face.
[186:02.33]Equip on the inventory screen to use.
[186:03.99]Guaranteed to kill enemies within its blast.
[186:05.65]Guaranteed to kill its enemies in its blast radius.
[186:10.37]I got a guarantee.
[186:15.93]I can't open that at all.
[186:17.67]I need some type of key or device.
[186:24.26]Nothing else in here.
[186:25.50]Am I still hurt?
[186:26.16]That's my health.
[186:28.04]Fuck, I am hurt.
[186:34.48]Is this open?
[186:35.64]No.
[186:37.10]Locked.
[186:38.69]Back up the stairs.
[186:40.61]Sure.
[186:47.71]Which takes us to... This is the only way I can go.
[186:50.02]Somebody up there?
[187:00.74]Somebody's walking up top.
[187:10.44]Like a boiler room?
[187:11.56]Probably an item somewhere, right?
[187:25.84]Machinery room.
[187:28.12]Only one way to go.
[187:40.83]The me?
[187:41.83]That's me!
[187:48.96]So they, they, they, they took me and this is my DNA.
[187:55.28]Where the fuck are we going?
[188:02.50]Oh, well, now it wants, it wants to go.
[188:04.18]It wants me to go.
[188:04.98]You gotta... Where the fuck...
[188:13.46]Boss?
[188:13.94]I'm fighting a boss.
[188:22.33]He's gonna give me a red herb right now.
[188:23.69]I need healing.
[188:27.24]What is this?
[188:28.08]Box?
[188:29.68]Oh, shit.
[188:30.44]What do I do about this?
[188:31.04]What do I do?
[188:31.32]What do I do?
[188:31.62]What do I do?
[188:31.94]What do I do?
[188:32.26]What do I do?
[188:32.56]What do I do?
[188:32.86]What do I do?
[188:33.22]What do I do?
[188:33.62]What do I do?
[188:41.80]Steam?
[188:42.12]I have to blast him with steam in the face.
[188:56.60]Guaranteed grenade.
[189:02.53]Blast him with steam.
[189:10.08]There's got to be something I can do to, like, blast him, right?
[189:17.15]Nothing to blast him.
[189:21.89]I'll give you a blast.
[189:30.73]You have a gun.
[189:31.41]I know, but I just want to see if there's, like, an environmental blast.
[189:37.02]Oh, should I just combine these two?
[189:38.44]I'm not going to use the heal.
[189:44.52]Just do it.
[189:45.16]Fuck it.
[189:45.50]Do it.
[189:46.94]Don't heal.
[189:47.48]Not gonna use it.
[189:47.98]Don't need it.
[189:54.04]Where is he?
[190:07.78]Wow!
[190:09.11]I see.
[190:09.61]I see.
[190:10.03]Right there.
[190:14.25]Oh shit, I didn't see it.
[190:15.55]No, that's what I... He's got an eye right there.
[190:56.84]No choice.
[191:03.93]Got to take it down.
[191:10.96]What?
[191:11.86]Show me the eye.
[191:12.54]Where's the fucking eye?
[191:15.25]Where's the eye?
[191:29.14]Even eye, like, up your ass or something?
[191:30.74]I don't get it.
[192:11.69]Oh shit!
[192:12.43]Where am I going?
[192:14.73]I turned around twice.
[192:15.71]I'm dead.
[192:16.37]See you later.
[192:17.77]It's gonna crush my spot.
[192:29.22]Goodbye.
[192:33.78]Now I play as him.
[192:34.44]That was scripted.
[192:38.00]Okay, so Eye opens up.
[192:39.92]Shoot Eye and run away.
[192:42.50]and then just just kill guy you shoot I okay uh I probably should get the first aid but we'll see you use grenade yeah I understand
[193:10.77]Can't go through there.
[193:12.33]Just unlocking it.
[193:13.19]I'm gonna save again.
[193:21.53]Should I just go back up?
[193:23.17]Let me see.
[193:23.89]Did I not bring the other... I thought I had one more first aid spray.
[193:28.09]Apparently not.
[193:31.90]This is... No, I gotta go now.
[193:32.76]No, no, just beat him.
[193:34.30]It's not gonna be a problem.
[193:36.24]Just fucking beat him.
[193:39.88]I'm good.
[193:48.74]No, fuck, no, against the other way.
[193:53.86]Left eye, middle eye, right eye, fire.
[193:57.17]At least now I know what to do.
[194:00.35]Alright, area, walk along.
[194:02.01]It really is nemesis.
[194:02.99]Just don't waste shots on him for no reason.
[194:09.74]Only shoot him when the eye opens and when you have an opportunity to shoot.
[194:12.26]Alright, here we go.
[194:19.46]FurtBernandez, 20 community subs.
[194:21.80]Thank you so much, Furt.

[194:54.55]Not yet.
[194:54.87]There's a heal right behind me.
[194:56.91]Let's go get the heal.
[195:02.43]Which... Right here.
[195:08.56]Well, this is not a heal, but...
[195:14.21]Which way you going, which way you going?
[195:16.85]Alright, which way is he?
[195:18.07]I don't know which way he is!
[195:27.48]And go, take it, use it!
[195:35.32]Where you at?
[195:41.81]I know, I know how to combine, yes.
[195:46.16]Alright.
[195:46.96]Where the hell did you go?
[195:49.28]Is he up top?
[195:49.96]Where the fuck is he?
[196:01.51]That eye ain't open yet.
[196:04.29]What's it gonna take?
[196:09.71]Open your eye!
[196:12.20]Open that eye!
[196:18.53]There it is.
[196:33.30]Oh, fuck!
[196:34.02]No, don't crush my head again!
[196:52.01]You gotta wait for the second swing.
[196:53.19]He swings twice.
[196:54.03]Get the heal.
[196:55.81]Oh, come on!
[196:56.75]I'm dead.
[196:57.27]Am I dead here?
[197:32.93]Steam.
[197:33.57]I didn't do that.
[197:36.17]Blast him right here, right?
[197:37.23]Where the fuck is he?
[197:45.19]What's going on?
[197:45.61]Is he getting steamed?
[197:48.11]Damn.
[197:49.18]Where is he?
[197:55.00]Wow.
[198:01.73]Where's the eye?
[198:13.09]Oh shit, that's a wall behind me.
[198:16.77]Oh my god, why is he doing this to me?
[198:20.11]He's running so fast.
[198:27.68]Open your eye.
[198:32.39]Goodbye.
[198:56.06]Is he smart?
[198:56.54]Is he gonna, like, wrap around this way?
[199:00.04]Got it.
[199:03.57]There he comes again.
[199:11.37]Don't go that way.
[199:26.84]Stop here, man.
[199:27.58]Stop here.
[199:33.50]Where are you?
[199:34.18]Are we getting even more steam in here?
[199:37.96]Oh fuck.
[199:38.22]Jeremy!
[200:16.09]He's probably gonna transform.
[200:18.99]Okay.
[200:25.59]That was pretty cool.
[200:29.73]That was fun.
[200:33.41]Phase two.
[200:36.29]Somebody's watching.
[200:37.18]Alright, I can leave the... Wait, hold on.
[200:41.42]Let me make sure I didn't leave anything here.
[200:43.38]I did.
[200:45.58]In the corner there is a grenade.
[200:46.92]That I didn't pick up.
[200:52.19]But where?
[200:56.19]Right there?
[201:00.52]Let's reload the guns.
[201:03.00]Four, and I got plenty of ammo left.
[201:05.08]That's good.
[201:17.96]Alright.
[201:18.99]Very cool.
[201:22.11]Gunpowder.
[201:22.69]What do we got down here?
[201:29.51]Looks like a whole lot of nothing.
[201:35.22]What's my health at right now?
[201:37.46]Fine.
[201:40.04]Jerma smells like Minecraft Steve.
[201:45.30]I don't know what that means.
[201:54.39]Like a piece of plastic?
[201:55.89]Like a brick?
[201:57.89]Minecraft Steve's not even a person.
[202:06.29]All the people in Minecraft are made out of blocks and shit, right?
[202:12.78]Is he gonna make a bridge go across?
[202:20.50]Mm-hmm.
[202:23.48]Minecraft Steve is more real than you.
[202:26.51]What?
[202:29.99]Minecraft Steve is made out of clay.
[202:32.13]He's made out of dirt blocks.
[202:42.59]So are you.
[202:44.27]Yeah?
[202:50.32]You ever seen somebody with this much, like, stretchy neck skin before?
[202:58.57]When I'm like 60, I'm gonna have to get that taken care of.
[203:09.97]Okay, let's see.
[203:13.59]I have a lot of red herbs.
[203:15.79]I feel like I'm gonna need them for poison later.
[203:24.17]Keep this in the inventory.
[203:27.62]That looks good.
[203:28.24]And what about take the boards?
[203:32.30]I feel like I'm going to need them.
[203:35.67]He doesn't know what red herbs do.
[203:37.43]Yes, I do.
[203:37.99]It's poison.
[203:40.35]Red and green is anti-poison.
[203:43.93]Red and blue is constitution, which I have no idea what that does.
[203:50.55]That's not what it does.
[203:53.03]That's incorrect.
[203:55.47]Are you sure?
[203:55.91]Do you have the game manual in front of you?
[203:57.45]Because I don't.
[204:19.52]Blue is poison.
[204:24.37]Okay.
[204:25.53]That's fine.
[204:29.16]Save point.
[204:32.58]Nice, another pouch.
[204:35.16]Oh, this just makes the game so much better.
[204:40.58]Streamer admits he was wrong.
[204:41.96]I will admit when I'm wrong.
[204:43.38]Of course I will.
[204:45.19]Can somebody with this much neck skin tell you, like, be wrong, be right all the time?
[204:49.45]No.
[204:50.59]No.
[204:58.89]This looks good.
[204:59.39]That means I can take... I'll take the jewel.
[205:03.49]Okay.
[205:14.85]You know that I'm a reptilian.
[205:19.80]I watched his eyes during the stream, and they were going like this.
[205:24.56]I did a freeze frame, and they turned green for a second.
[205:42.40]See Leon's eyes there?
[205:43.90]They went like... Parking garage.
[206:04.03]so uh three and a half hours ago I was gonna say this and we had the internet problems and we seem to be okay now but so what I think I was gonna say back when I was like oh I want to make this I got something I gotta say so in the original game there was an npc who was the gun store owner and I was really did they omit that from the game because he was my favorite npc of the game
[206:28.15]The guy that goes, who are you?
[206:30.01]And what are you doing here?
[206:31.75]It better be the same voice actor.
[206:33.21]They better have just taken that same audio file and put it over him.
[206:38.18]That's in Claire's campaign?
[206:40.28]Oh.
[206:43.22]That's too bad.
[206:46.30]I think I'm going to restart the game and play as Claire.
[206:52.01]Alright, big open space.
[206:53.79]There's probably going to be something that jumps out here.
[206:58.45]No, uh, this door looks locked and it is Don't go too fast Probably a liquor or something
[207:31.40]Guy in the trash?
[207:32.30]No.
[207:33.34]Item in the trash?
[207:34.42]No.
[207:39.33]There's two more doors.
[207:40.33]That door's locked.
[207:43.35]They're all locked.
[207:47.13]Okay.
[207:51.80]Hmm.
[208:00.44]All of them are locked.
[208:03.78]Fuse box?
[208:04.44]No.
[208:07.21]Parking garage ticket?
[208:10.86]I don't have one.
[208:12.52]Oh, cutscene.
[208:34.96]Boom.

[209:15.66]Sorry, that information is classified.
[209:18.04]Where are you going?
[209:21.78]Do yourself a favor.
[209:23.94]Stop asking questions and get the hell out of here.
[209:30.01]Underappreciated emotes, Saturn.
[209:33.46]Oh, by the way, just want to let everybody know, because there's people here, right?
[209:41.07]The t-shirts that I've been talking about, remember I told you that before January was over?
[209:47.41]The shirts are coming up tomorrow.
[209:49.41]So the shirts will be launching, if not tomorrow, then Wednesday.
[209:51.92]I'm going to try to get it to work, try to launch the t-shirts.
[209:56.58]Two of them, Gloom Man's coming back, and the Solar System, because somebody brought up the Solar System.
[210:01.81]So that's going to happen tomorrow or Wednesday.
[210:04.37]I have not figured it out yet.
[210:05.23]Make sure I get it ready to go.
[210:07.77]But yeah.
[210:08.81]And they will be there permanently.
[210:10.75]So no more three-week campaigns.
[210:16.06]And the Gloom Man shirt is going to be in like three colors.
[210:19.72]Get it if you feel like it whenever you want.
[210:23.12]How much money for a shirt?
[210:24.08]20 bucks.
[210:27.28]Or like, yeah, probably 20 bucks.
[210:31.02]Because I think there's like different, I get a lot, I was trying to talk to somebody at Teespring because it, three years ago when I made the shirt the first time, it was, there's different like t-shirt material.
[210:43.66]You can do like premium shirts that cost more.
[210:45.74]I don't know.
[210:46.84]I have to like look into that, but it probably will not be more than $20 for sure.
[210:51.14]So there you go.
[210:55.38]Do I accept what coins?
[210:56.72]I don't know what that means.
[211:01.16]Nah, a shirt on this channel would never be more than like $22 to $25, but I'm not going to need to do that.
[211:07.73]It'll be $20 for a shirt.
[211:09.11]So where am I going?
[211:13.55]Whoa, hold on, this door opened.
[211:15.11]Both doors just opened.
[211:17.04]I could follow, I'll follow her out.
[211:19.02]Whatever, let's go this way.
[211:22.32]He's already raising the prices!
[211:25.20]No, I just said $20.
[211:33.28]Okay, this opens that, which brings me to the jail.
[211:37.02]Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[211:42.22]Police station B1 map.

[212:02.63]No.
[212:04.15]We talked about why.
[212:06.11]We talked about why before.
[212:11.15]Don't just sprint.
[212:11.93]Wait a minute.
[212:12.55]Go save the game.
[212:14.49]Can I get like a save point in the jail somewhere?
[212:16.70]You're going to break this open.
[212:23.92]I know you are.
[212:25.66]Should I just take care of it?
[212:35.90]They're all gonna open.
[212:38.10]Just watch.
[212:44.18]All these damn things are gonna open.
[213:04.47]That's gonna open them.
[213:05.80]So I need to have an escape route here.
[213:07.24]Doesn't look like there's any items in any of these cells.
[213:12.53]Hello?
[213:13.49]NPC.
[213:14.23]Hey.
[213:15.33]I don't believe it.
[213:16.33]A real human.
[213:17.17]Hello, human.
[213:20.23]You been here long?
[213:21.73]Long enough.
[213:23.37]Are we the last ones alive?
[213:25.57]Who's that?
[213:25.87]He has a full cigarette.
[213:28.21]Just took one haul and threw it in the trash?
[213:31.25]On the ground?
[213:54.66]Hey, I'll make you a deal.
[213:57.34]Unlock this cell and I'll give you this.
[213:58.53]Okay.
[213:58.95]There's no other way out of that parking garage.
[214:00.57]Believe me.
[214:01.55]Sorry, I can't do that.
[214:03.75]I have to talk to the chief first.
[214:06.55]Look, we're both prisoners in this station.
[214:09.69]I'll do it.
[214:09.99]So we can play nice and help each other out.
[214:13.60]Shit.
[214:14.54]It's coming.
[214:15.26]What's coming?
[214:16.28]What's coming?
[214:16.88]Come on.
[214:17.62]Come on, don't be an asshole.
[214:19.14]You need this.
[214:37.10]Oh, what is that?
[214:37.88]I just did a boss.
[214:40.58]I just did a boss.
[214:42.07]It was Ada!
[214:45.99]Sorry, she's got the same glove.
[214:49.37]Ada, you got superpowers, huh?
[214:52.47]Yeah, sometimes I get literally fucking mad and I turn green.
[214:55.20]I get huge.
[214:56.44]Just don't make me pissed off.
[214:57.58]He was an informant.
[215:03.65]Had information of use to my investigation.
[215:06.45]So what he said was true?
[215:07.61]I didn't have breakfast this morning.
[215:08.73]Hey, you can't keep walking away from me.
[215:14.28]I don't even know your name.
[215:17.52]I'm Leon Kennedy.
[215:21.94]No.
[215:22.56]Find a way out, Leon, before it's too late.
[215:26.62]You're really going to give your full hand there.
[215:28.88]Just say, my name is L.
[215:30.55]Name's Ada.
[215:31.47]Okay, that's a start.
[215:33.11]You give him one letter first, and then you say, I'll give you the next letter when I see you again, if you give me your first letter.
[215:37.65]Well, I guess the deal's on.
[215:44.62]That's the... Pull the lever, and then... Hold on, before I do that, let me make sure I don't miss any items.
[215:51.86]Because they're all going to open, and I've got to get a perfect escape route.
[215:54.93]So... That's the key card to the parking garage.
[216:03.68]Which means I just gotta go right out the door after pulling this.
[216:08.36]So I gotta be prepared.
[216:09.26]I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
[216:12.58]There's a tool.
[216:13.54]It's like a crank.
[216:15.54]I know where that goes.
[216:17.32]Jail power panel.
[216:18.92]Uh, I assume everyone knows, but since the jail's power panel is old as hell, we're gonna need those custom power panel parts no one makes anymore.
[216:26.15]There should be a few in the generator room.
[216:29.15]Okay.
[216:31.55]Okay, there's only one of those power panel parts in the generator room.
[216:35.01]The guy that's here to fix the bell in the clock tower should have another.
[216:37.58]So someone swipe, I mean ask nicely for it, please.
[216:41.90]Okay.
[216:49.73]So I have an unfortunate thing to say.
[216:51.15]And it's actually kind of, this really, like, sucks, actually.
[216:58.26]um remember a couple days ago when I thought I was getting like a migraine and it it's happening again uh wait wait why can't why is this not open I just did the power does that not do anything
[217:31.70]Oh, okay.
[217:36.07]Sometimes, the unfortunate truth about this is, sometimes I get like a string of headaches, and a string of like migraines, and then I'm fine.
[217:45.84]For like another, like after a few days.
[217:49.54]I have seen a doctor about it, don't worry.
[217:51.80]But, it's kind of happening again.
[217:56.05]Unfortunately.
[218:00.77]I get like a string of like five, four or five days in a row where I'm just really fucked up.
[218:06.17]But... I'm alright right now, but the stream may have to do another one of those... Ending before I want to.
[218:15.21]But, what can you do, right?
[218:17.95]Uh, electronic door panel.
[218:19.31]It's that thing right there.
[218:20.99]Oh, I can't use it.
[218:21.73]Let me look at that thing again.
[218:22.55]Uh, alright.
[218:27.22]We're gonna need those custom power panel parts.
[218:31.17]Yeah, I've been sleeping fine.
[218:37.64]Just taking aspirin.
[218:40.16]Nah, I'll be good.
[218:40.82]Don't worry.
[218:42.70]This should be a few in the generator.
[218:43.58]I've got to go to the generator room.
[218:46.98]I got word that there's only one of those power panel parts in the generator room.
[218:49.59]The guy that's here to fix the bell in the clock tower should have another.
[218:54.93]So clock tower and then generator room.
[218:57.81]Let's see where that is.
[219:00.73]generator room so we have to go out this way so back to the garage get some I've been drinking water I mean I made the joke how I went and got coffee again but when I was downstairs I had a full glass of water so that's I don't think it's that but yeah
[219:24.43]If I do end up stopping prematurely, then we will try it again tomorrow.
[219:30.25]We'll do it again tomorrow.
[219:34.30]Okay, so what other door?
[219:36.64]This door opened over here.
[219:41.06]Make sure you have good posture.
[219:42.16]No, I'm good.
[219:43.32]I'm good.
[219:45.74]You're supposed to drink four gallons of water a day.
[219:50.97]That is not sound medical advice.
[219:54.01]I will tell you.
[219:56.69]This is a stray generator room.
[219:58.34]We can go up here.
[219:59.32]I don't know.
[220:00.36]I guess down?
[220:01.80]Through the kennel.
[220:02.42]Let me check over here first.
[220:14.85]Shooting range.
[220:18.99]Lunchbox.
[220:22.20]I'm going to examine that right now.
[220:26.48]There's something inside.
[220:30.21]And... A well-worn key.
[220:36.33]Equipment disposal notice.
[220:39.85]Bent key no longer usable, but can still open the car's doors and trunks with its keyless entry buttons.
[220:49.08]So it can open car doors and trunks.
[220:52.90]That's excellent to know.
[220:56.20]A message from Mr. Raccoon.
[220:58.68]Howdy, boys and girls.
[220:59.46]This is your pal from the Raccoon City Zoo.
[221:00.98]It's always great to see you.
[221:02.72]Today I want to talk about something really important.
[221:04.26]You know, my popular Mr. Raccoon toys.
[221:07.48]Well, I heard some bad kids have been using them for target practice.
[221:12.92]Bobbleheads, right?
[221:15.36]Good little kids wouldn't be that mean, right?
[221:18.05]Plus, it's super dangerous.
[221:23.03]Bobbleheads?
[221:24.79]That sounds like a graphograph.
[221:28.35]It really does.
[221:28.85]But I'm going to assume that's the bobbleheads of this game.
[221:35.06]I'd probably be correct, right?
[221:47.57]There's one right there.
[221:54.80]After you shoot ten of them, eight of them, whatever, you get probably a gun, right?
[221:58.14]I'm gonna get the bad ending if you shoot them.
[222:03.45]Kind of like a waste of bullets unless I really care, right?
[222:09.81]Can I go this way?
[222:12.72]I need a diamond key.
[222:13.94]This guy's gonna get up.
[222:28.06]Yeah, shotgun bullets.
[222:29.34]When I pick these up, they're gonna stand up.
[222:31.36]Like every video game ever made.
[222:33.06]No?
[222:33.26]Maybe not.
[222:37.57]Nothing on either one of you?
[222:43.31]Well, I was gonna give my first impressions before I got jumpscared.
[222:47.95]This is, uh... This is very, very good.
[222:52.81]It's very, very sound, fun gameplay.
[222:56.79]Now everything's connected, and everything, you can see everything, the doors, everything makes sense.
[223:01.69]It's very, I would, I would, this is great.
[223:04.07]This is a very good game.
[223:05.37]So far.
[223:05.87]It's been fantastic.
[223:10.00]This door's locked.
[223:13.62]You're gonna fall through the floor again.
[223:15.40]Imagine, that would be ridiculous.
[223:17.36]At that point, I knew what was gonna happen.
[223:19.86]And I'm just pretending for the video.
[223:21.18]You know what I mean?
[223:24.18]This is also blocked off.
[223:28.68]So we can go... Got the key and the crank.
[223:33.72]Let's go around.
[223:39.99]Just check around the other side.
[223:42.33]Is it a shotgun?
[223:43.21]I thought it was just an umbrella.
[223:46.17]I was like, new shotgun, just sitting on a bench.
[223:48.05]Alright, slow down.
[224:02.93]Finally, a blue herb.
[224:06.51]We can use that.
[224:11.77]What the fuck is in here?
[224:13.08]Loaded, right?
[224:13.74]Loaded.
[224:14.02]There's the kennel.
[224:15.78]There's gonna be dogs here.
[224:24.39]Watch out for space.
[224:25.23]I'm running out of space.
[224:35.99]Mmm, the dogs are gonna be so fast, too, and it's gonna... No, oh god, oh god, just end it, do it!
[224:50.45]Go, go, get out, out, out, out, out, out, before they break out, they're gonna break out, they're gonna, just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, run, run, just run through.
[224:58.62]Vent?
[225:00.88]Is it a dog door?
[225:01.76]Watch out for the dog door.
[225:02.64]Where am I?
[225:03.94]Hang a left?
[225:14.59]It's actually a doggy door.
[225:24.31]Well, here's a crank.
[225:27.78]That'll bring it back out here.
[225:29.86]What is out here?
[225:30.62]Oh, there's the generator room over there.
[225:40.01]Let me go to the morgue first.
[225:45.16]Fucking doggy door.
[225:53.98]Autopsy record number 53,477.
[225:55.00]Found dead in jail cell bed by staff.
[226:02.33]Clenched due to rigor mortis.
[226:05.23]Seized was known kleptomaniac.
[226:09.16]He would steal even while in jail, though that was consistent with his clinical diagnosis.
[226:18.12]Okay.
[226:23.37]Why do I hear shit right now?
[226:25.93]Somebody's gonna break out of one of these fucking doors.
[226:34.47]Here we go.
[226:37.93]Somebody's gonna be on one of these dinner plates.
[226:44.00]Ugh.
[226:44.72]Fuck.
[226:46.86]Yep, he's gonna jump out.
[226:48.04]What are you holding?
[226:58.47]Diamond key.
[227:01.21]I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!
[227:23.31]No!
[227:23.67]I didn't want to do that.
[227:25.31]I keep thinking it's a knife.
[227:48.23]Come on, where's the jackpot?
[227:49.35]There's got to be something here.
[228:00.90]Come on, give me a jackpot.
[228:03.08]That's not a jackpot.
[228:05.30]That's just a flash grenade.
[228:18.41]Really?
[228:20.29]No jackpot?
[228:23.50]What the hell are these bugs?
[228:28.74]They're faces?
[228:29.42]I don't know.
[228:34.51]red herb I'll take it I can do three though red blue green is a full super heal right and that will red come out of all three of them that's a super heal and it's poison
[229:08.94]So we need to hold on to this until we really, really need it.
[229:11.68]It's a defense bonus, poison heal, super heal.
[229:16.73]Good.
[229:25.67]That wasn't really a jackpot, but I'll take it.
[229:28.91]Nothing else in here.
[229:31.85]Bullets are doing fine.
[229:37.49]Alright.
[229:38.77]Let's get to the generator room.
[229:40.67]RGB healing?
[229:44.33]Yeah.
[229:44.75]Now there's supposed to be a piece in here.
[229:52.32]Right?
[229:53.06]Somewhere?
[230:01.04]Box electronic part.
[230:03.62]There's one of two.
[230:05.18]And then I gotta go to the clock tower.
[230:09.49]Wherever that is.
[230:11.29]Doggy door.
[230:11.95]You're not going to fucking fool me.
[230:38.54]I'm so paranoid right now.
[230:39.50]Okay, so this is on, on, on, on.
[230:49.22]They're all on.
[230:52.22]That didn't do anything.
[230:55.89]Maybe on, off, on, on?
[231:05.03]So what, they'll probably all have to be, both of them, okay, I see.
[231:09.44]So I think both need to be in the red, so we got it on.
[231:11.56]That's it, right?
[231:13.40]No, not quite.
[231:16.86]There it is.
[231:20.60]Gotta hit that sweet spot.
[231:33.19]Where I see the shadow!
[231:43.96]One climbed over.
[231:44.70]There's a heal right there.
[231:57.79]Just give me the heal.
[232:03.75]I got enough room for it.
[232:04.79]Why do I have the boards?
[232:05.99]The boards are so useless right now.
[232:07.98]I don't even need them.
[232:10.26]Alright, bingo.
[232:12.74]Where the fuck is the dog?
[232:13.52]Where is the dog?
[232:14.18]He's sticking his head through the dog door.
[232:18.49]Oh, shit!
[232:23.77]Oh, I hate it.
[232:24.30]Uh, where was it?
[232:26.64]Where was it?
[232:42.51]I'ma shot it again.
[233:03.00]Okay, so I gotta get out of here, then go all the way around and up.
[233:09.22]Oh my fucking face!
[233:22.46]Jesus.
[233:23.68]Okay.
[233:24.74]We're good.
[233:25.30]We're safe.
[233:26.17]That's all the dogs.
[233:27.01]No more dogs.
[233:27.57]No more dog doors.
[233:33.15]Is there another dog?
[233:33.83]Okay.
[233:46.07]That's what opened over here and then bang it left.
[233:52.30]Okay, I made it.
[233:54.20]Nothing else, right?
[233:54.92]I think we're good.
[234:05.43]There they go.
[234:10.33]That brings us all the way up here.
[234:13.38]Oh, wow.
[234:13.68]We're back at the main halls out here.
[234:18.02]Very cool.
[234:24.21]Combine.
[234:24.73]Combine.
[234:28.95]Key for the range.
[234:38.08]Ignition key for a car.
[234:39.14]Blade is bent.
[234:43.23]Let me get to a save point first, and then I can go back.
[234:45.61]There's like a break room here.
[234:47.45]There we go.
[234:58.47]Is there a storage unit in here?
[235:01.53]Shit, there's no unit in here.
[235:05.31]Electrical part.
[235:06.73]Shit.
[235:07.29]Okay, I need a box.
[235:11.83]Oh, I need a box.
[235:14.83]Hey, look, there's a box.
[235:17.97]Okay.
[235:18.73]So, I... Let's store this for a second.
[235:23.36]I just need... I gotta see what I got here.
[235:26.10]Another key.
[235:33.01]Still don't need the jewel yet.
[235:38.49]I'm probably gonna need this.
[235:45.25]Yeah, I have the red herbs to combine with.
[235:48.35]Yes, yes, yes.
[235:49.03]Okay.
[235:56.81]Gunpowder.
[235:57.25]I got gunpowder.
[235:58.55]I can make some shotgun ammo, right?
[235:59.88]Because I have one more.
[236:00.72]Do I have any yellow?
[236:01.70]Yeah, I do.
[236:05.26]Shotgun ammo.
[236:10.40]I can make some more pistol ammo.
[236:11.48]Yeah, I'll do it.
[236:13.56]Why not?
[236:19.14]Because then I can keep this one gunpowder.
[236:24.52]This window is here to board.
[236:25.66]That's a good idea.
[236:26.60]Don't need the flash.
[236:31.55]There was another place down where I could use this.
[236:34.53]Wasn't there somewhere down on the actual floor here?
[236:40.89]I'm glad to be here.
[236:44.17]Thank you.
[236:45.31]Glad to have you.
[236:46.93]Thanks for sticking around.
[236:50.85]If you don't organize it, then I'm going to be very mad.
[236:53.73]There, see?
[237:05.92]Got two boards, 45, car key.
[237:11.82]And I have to stop.
[237:15.16]I have to.
[237:17.60]I'm sorry.
[237:21.31]um sorry that we have to stop so early but like I can feel it now so kind of annoying that this has kind of happened twice two streams in a row but uh I got another doctor's appointment coming up so I'm gonna bring it up again but uh I'm fine don't worry
[237:47.52]I just kind of have, like, another weird headache again that, like, won't really go away.
[237:53.01]So, uh... I hate to stop after four hours.
[238:00.41]But I have to.
[238:03.01]I don't want to just, like, do it.
[238:04.85]I'd rather enjoy this and, like, be able to have fun and hang out with you guys and actually not have to think about, like, this.
[238:12.00]So we're going to try tomorrow.
[238:13.18]We're going to do it again tomorrow.
[238:16.80]uh take care of yourselves if you're gonna take off I I I got I can still do the bits we've only been streaming for about four hours so uh sorry again that we have to stop um trust me I I want to stream but it's kind of annoying really annoying actually but whatever you do what you got to do right uh thank you for watching we're gonna just we're gonna pick up exactly right here tomorrow exactly where we left off
[238:43.46]And we'll try again.
[238:45.60]Thank you so much for your patience and understanding, everybody.
[238:48.98]There was a lot of support tonight, like there always is.
[238:52.04]Much love to you.
[238:52.58]Thank you so much for coming out.
[238:55.67]And I even had a day off yesterday, too.
[238:58.49]Should have just streamed yesterday.
[238:59.49]I felt fine.
[239:01.13]Whatever.
[239:05.17]Take care, guys.
[239:10.25]Did I even feel fine?
[239:11.05]I don't remember.
[239:12.16]I probably did.
[239:16.80]Yesterday, you said tomorrow.
[239:22.01]So, I'll see you again tomorrow.
[239:24.09]I'm going to complete this on stream because it's a great game.
[239:26.55]I'm having a bunch of fun so far.
[239:29.89]But let's do the bits.
[239:32.81]We don't have very much to go through, I don't think.
[239:34.23]So, no, not really.
[239:36.27]So, it shouldn't take us too long.
[239:41.86]We had a dollar from Timmy Tim Tam.
[239:45.22]Thank you, Timmy Tim Tam.
[239:50.92]No bits.
[239:51.48]Go to bed.
[239:55.06]No, we're okay.
[239:55.86]We're okay.
[239:56.42]I can... I can do this.
[239:57.98]I'll be good.
[239:59.92]There's only about maybe 10 to 15 to go through anyways.
[240:08.61]But let's... Thanks for the dollar.
[240:12.61]It's a YouTube link.
[240:15.93]Another daily conversation in English.
[240:17.53]Let's see what it is.
[240:19.72]That was like a pretty normal conversation.
[240:43.02]But thank you.
[240:43.48]Thank you, Sad Vega for the $1.
[240:45.08]Oh boy, Resident Evil 2, hope you do this hardcore.
[240:47.58]You're robbing yourself for great experience if you don't do hardcore first time through.
[240:51.10]Let me tell you hardcore mode first time.
[240:54.40]Woo, will you be on the edge of your seat?
[240:59.60]No, we're going to do normal.
[241:00.58]I just want to play through.
[241:01.28]I don't want to panic.
[241:04.35]Thank you, Alec for the $1.
[241:05.47]Can't wait to see you scream at Mr. X.
[241:09.33]I don't know what that is, but I'm sure I'll, whatever, whoever that is.
[241:15.68]Dork Cube, thanks for the $1.
[241:16.88]My brother and I were watching back through your subscriber milestone videos, and when I told him that Burger Boy was married, he was amazed that even the egg could find love.
[241:26.58]Yeah.
[241:28.46]Look, everybody.
[241:29.32]There's somebody out there for everybody, guys.
[241:30.40]Don't worry.
[241:33.33]Thank you, Crusade, for the $4.
[241:35.33]Thank you, Divus, for the $2.
[241:36.15]Thank you, guys.
[241:40.76]Uh, thank you, Fricknut, for the $1.
[241:43.58]Pause the game, I need to pee.
[241:45.06]You can pee right now.
[241:48.70]You got time to pee right now?
[241:51.64]Flugboy, thanks for the $1.
[241:52.96]So I honestly have been trying to stay away from watching Resident Evil 2 gameplay, but I couldn't stay away from watching yours.
[241:58.77]Just want to say, after Resident Evil 7, this will be my first Resident Evil game, and I want to go back and play the other.
[242:04.67]Do you think it's worth to buy the previous consoles for it?
[242:08.91]Uh, I don't think you need to.
[242:12.38]At least three or four of them have been ported, right?
[242:14.80]Aren't there at least a few of them that have been ported to the PC?
[242:19.16]I don't think you have to go back to the old, old consoles.
[242:30.83]But they're great games.
[242:32.14]Some of them are a little old and dated.
[242:36.35]But I think they're still all great experiences as long as you can stomach a lot of kind of old-school type of gameplay.
[242:46.37]Resident Evil 3 Remake is coming up for sure after this.
[242:49.01]I would be surprised if they didn't just do them all up until 4.
[242:51.85]I mean, they already kind of did one, but not like this.
[242:57.71]But thank you, Flugboy, for the two dolls.
[242:59.17]Also, sorry for the lack of bits.
[243:00.67]I hope you're doing well, Jeremy.
[243:01.65]Much love to you, Kim, and Etalyx, and the rest of the family.
[243:06.08]Don't worry about a lack of money.
[243:08.34]You don't have to... You don't have to pay me.
[243:11.33]Don't worry about that.
[243:12.31]Thank you for sticking around.
[243:13.09]Thanks for watching.
[243:13.67]Thanks for the support as always.
[243:16.65]Robot Mentality, thanks for the $1.
[243:19.25]Andy's Mountain, thanks for the $5.
[243:20.23]Hey Jerma, are you still planning on releasing shirts?
[243:24.62]Tomorrow or Wednesday?
[243:27.00]It'll be a storefront.
[243:28.14]It'll be there forever.
[243:28.80]Because I can do other stuff besides shirts.
[243:34.33]Uh, thank you, Jeremiah, for the $5.
[243:35.61]I love you, Jerma, but your incompetence dishonored a great game with Toy Commander.
[243:41.81]Uh... It's alright.
[243:47.50]Toy Commander was fun.
[243:48.40]I don't need to watch the speedrun.
[243:53.64]Appreciate the $5, though.
[243:54.66]Thank you.
[243:54.94]Uh, Anonymous, thanks for the $1, Anonymous.
[243:58.66]Hey, Jerma, it's the Animal Rescue Guy.
[244:00.24]Just wanted to say thanks for having people go to my baby duck stream...
[244:04.34]I truly didn't expect that.
[244:05.84]Hoping a few people got cheered up by watching them.
[244:07.74]Thanks again.
[244:09.52]For sure, yeah.
[244:09.94]They're very cute ducks.
[244:16.29]Everybody loves ducks.
[244:20.33]But thank you.
[244:23.21]We had some big bits just coming right now.
[244:26.12]From Gornhole.
[244:27.58]$50 from Gornhole.
[244:30.16]Thank you.
[244:32.63]Here, have some bits for the Bitcoin-operated doctor on the Vegas Strip.
[244:35.79]I hear he's great at telling the future for 25 cents a pop.
[244:39.41]What?
[244:42.08]Thank you so much for the $50, Gornhole.
[244:44.54]Is that even real?
[244:47.92]That's not a real thing, is it?
[244:54.99]Thank you so much.
[244:59.61]And then the Olaf gave us a million subs.
[245:02.57]Thank you so much.
[245:03.43]That's so much.
[245:04.97]So much, so much.
[245:05.83]I just said so much so many times.
[245:08.77]But thank you.
[245:12.12]Apocalyptic Cheeseburger, thank you again for $15 and $50 on top of that.
[245:18.82]Cox seems to have gotten the message.
[245:20.48]My friend from Nevada who works with them said there was a surge a few minutes ago when I asked him about it.
[245:29.86]Really?
[245:33.16]So, that was... There was a surge?
[245:36.16]So, should I not have been talking all that shit?
[245:38.28]Oh, of course I should have.
[245:41.35]Was there more money?
[245:42.37]Lacronda, $50.
[245:46.97]My goodness, thank you.
[245:48.33]$50 more.
[245:48.55]You guys are showing me so much love and so much support.
[245:55.25]I gotta get, like, a full stream in here.
[246:00.89]four hours four and a half five hours I usually like to go for like six to eight where's my goddamn stamina lately with these fucking migraine things thank you they say hey Jerm I love donating to you I plan on donating even more in the future I love the rush of being noticed by somebody I idolize well let me tell you one very important thing you don't have to pay me to do that
[246:29.11]I hope you know that it doesn't matter if you give me $50, $100, $2, $5.
[246:33.77]Thank you.
[246:36.24]You're allowing me to do this and do it for a living.
[246:40.98]So you don't have to worry about paying me that much money.
[246:45.43]I just hope you all know that.
[246:48.97]There's no requirement to have to give me money so I'll be thanking you, you know what I mean?
[246:56.00]Like, you being here by yourself, one out of doesn't matter how many people.
[247:04.01]I appreciate you nonetheless.
[247:06.91]But thank you so much for even thinking about doing it in the first place.
[247:10.77]That goes for everybody.
[247:17.02]back earlier, uh, after some of these huge community subs.
[247:21.36]Uh, but thank you, uh, Apocalyptic Cheeseburger.
[247:24.28]Hopefully that it was just a problem.
[247:27.34]And it's fine now, because that would be very annoying if it didn't go away, which has been weird the last week.
[247:33.88]Uh, thank you, Meow, for the $1.
[247:35.08]Have fun getting spooked, Jerma.
[247:37.22]I know I did on my first playthrough.
[247:38.64]It's been pretty scary.
[247:41.88]It's been pretty good.
[247:43.04]There's been some decent scares.
[247:45.78]Thank you, IkeTurtle, for the one dollar.
[247:47.06]The game's graphics were very impressive.
[247:48.56]That sweaty zombie in the corner looked very realistic and frightening.
[247:54.05]Also this.
[247:54.63]I look like Leon Kennedy.
[247:56.25]Good.
[247:59.07]Yeah, good.
[248:00.25]From the Christmas stream?
[248:01.05]Yeah, he's a handsome guy.
[248:05.29]Hey, SolidMilk, thanks for the dollar.
[248:06.96]Cox controls compact consumer's crappy connection.
[248:11.62]The six C's.
[248:15.07]It's true.
[248:16.43]But I need to know my own limitations.
[248:17.45]And I've told you guys this a lot of times.
[248:18.83]If I know that I'm not going to be able to put forth something that's... I don't want to force myself to do something.
[248:45.89]And if I know in my brain and in my heart that I know that I'm going to have to force myself to do this and kind of power through an issue, I'd rather do it again.
[248:57.40]Just do it again and we can just go again and have fun.
[249:01.19]Not like I wasn't having any fun, but I could just tell.
[249:04.37]I could feel it.
[249:05.29]And it's starting to happen now too.
[249:09.03]But that's just kind of a mentality I've always had.
[249:12.23]But thank you so much for the ten bucks.
[249:14.19]Thank you, Sosredo, for the three dollars.
[249:15.73]It's a clip.
[249:16.29]Let's see what it is.
[249:18.11]He wasn't... No, no, no.
[249:18.97]I was having a lot of fun.
[249:19.85]This game's fucking awesome.
[249:21.47]It's just... Why is this black screen?
[249:28.40]Alright, back to the dark room.
[249:30.74]And the storage box.
[249:31.58]I'm gonna burp.
[249:39.11]That's why I don't like the face cam.
[249:40.95]Really.
[249:42.41]Uh, Joel.
[249:43.29]Thank, uh, not Joel.
[249:44.47]Thank you, IamMonk, for the one dollar.
[249:45.99]Joel has your back.
[249:47.93]Nothing.
[250:09.50]We just had Jerma host us, we're not gonna have this.
[250:13.06]He's got my back, hey.
[250:14.64]That's enough.
[250:19.16]I can't laugh that hard right now.
[250:24.52]Just, hey, Joel, all I gotta say is one thing.
[250:27.33]Just wait till the fucking gamer challenge.
[250:31.17]Oh, he's so bad at games, you know.
[250:32.95]Just, I'm gonna turn it on and I'm gonna destroy you in the video gamer challenge.
[250:41.89]What happened to Jerma?
[250:42.61]He sounds sad.
[250:43.31]I'm not sad.
[250:44.03]I'm perfectly fucking happy.
[250:45.69]Everything's great.
[250:47.03]Except for I've developed another headache here.
[250:49.93]In the middle of the stream.
[250:50.81]And I'm doing just alright.
[250:52.15]I'm doing fine.
[250:56.11]But thank you, IamMonk, for the clip.
[250:58.39]Mouse8, thanks for 10 bucks.
[250:59.73]A jewel for your scepter.
[251:00.91]Also examine the scepter with a winky face.
[251:04.30]Thank you, Mouse8, for the tips.
[251:07.12]And the 10 bucks.
[251:07.86]I'm not sad.
[251:09.28]I'm not sad.
[251:11.38]Oh my god, another $50.
[251:12.70]Holy shit.
[251:16.58]AceMcLace, 50 bucks.
[251:18.90]Head pain is the bane of my existence.
[251:21.67]Thanks for the stream, Jerem.
[251:23.27]Jeremaheart, Jeremaheart.
[251:26.45]Yeah, there's one thing I really can't handle.
[251:31.68]And it's like head pain, like headache.
[251:35.02]It makes anything I do impossible.
[251:38.43]So those of you guys that get, like, cluster headaches and migraines and headaches a couple times a week, I completely feel your pain here.
[251:45.40]I completely understand exactly.
[251:47.78]It sucks.
[251:51.54]Joel already challenged me?
[251:52.62]Yeah, I know, but I don't want to play Getting Over It.
[251:55.42]He's already getting practice.
[251:56.59]That's not fair.
[251:57.53]How would that be fair at all?
[252:01.23]I don't get the practice in Getting Over It.
[252:03.39]He's streamed it, like, twice in a row now.
[252:11.36]We gotta do something that we both have never done.
[252:17.13]Toothaches are worse.
[252:18.03]Yeah, those are... Those are really bad, too.
[252:21.55]There's a lot, but I don't know.
[252:25.19]It's tough.
[252:27.05]But... Thank you so much to Mouse8.
[252:31.89]Thank you, SmellyBoy, for the $1.
[252:33.35]I shoveled snow.
[252:36.19]Congratulations on the snow shoveling.
[252:37.59]I haven't seen snow in a while.
[252:39.77]Part of me misses it.
[252:41.86]Part of me misses it.
[252:45.22]Thank you, Yiliwa.
[252:48.52]Thank you for the $1.
[252:51.85]Robot Mentality, thanks for the $1.
[252:54.77]Slop Shop, thanks for the $10.
[252:56.69]Slop Shop.
[252:58.29]Hey, Jerm, I've been a fan of the channel for a while.
[253:00.15]When is the live-action Jerma Rumble 2 happening?
[253:04.32]I want it to.
[253:06.36]I don't have a set date.
[253:07.74]I don't have a set date for really anything.
[253:09.88]But it's definitely something I want to do.
[253:14.32]And that would be something that I would want to be actually live broadcasted on Twitch as an event.
[253:20.56]And really go all out.
[253:23.62]Even more so than I did last time.
[253:25.24]So definitely something I want to do.
[253:27.18]Stay tuned.
[253:29.90]What about the school play?
[253:30.86]Yep, that would be a nice precursor, wouldn't it?
[253:34.21]But Slopshop, thank you for $20.
[253:35.35]You gave another $10 as well.
[253:37.19]Thank you.
[253:37.97]Right after that.
[253:40.09]Thank you so much for the $20.
[253:42.74]Egg Johnson, thanks for the $1.
[253:44.08]Please stop playing.
[253:44.98]I want to go play the game and I can't if you're streaming.
[253:47.78]Also, would you play Fortnite if they added you as a playable character?
[253:50.42]No.
[253:53.58]Hey, well, I stopped streaming.
[253:55.84]So you can go play it.
[253:58.34]Hey, you got Egg.
[254:00.66]Egg Johnson, you got your wish.
[254:03.53]Wish granted.
[254:05.81]But no, I wouldn't play Fortnite if I was a playable character.
[254:11.90]I wouldn't... I'd be like, oh, that's kind of cool.
[254:14.76]And then I'd say, um... Where's my lawyer?
[254:19.09]And then I would lawyer up.
[254:21.07]Then I would just start calling and suing everybody.
[254:25.59]You know how quickly they'd get sued?
[254:33.22]Sue Fortnite.
[254:34.40]Peaceful Hayley, thanks for the $1.
[254:35.72]Hey Jeremy, just stopping by to say hi.
[254:37.70]And recently, I don't know, I've been so confused on what I want to do with my life.
[254:40.72]I mean, I know what to do, I guess, but starting is the hardest part.
[254:45.08]I've been streaming, which is fun, and I'm just trying to go through more creative routes in my life.
[254:48.70]Because all I want in life is to make myself and others happy.
[254:51.41]And yeah, I don't want to ramble, but thanks for the inspiration.
[254:57.71]The thing about, like, creative stuff and challenging yourself creatively... Creativily?
[255:03.01]Creatively?
[255:03.75]What the fuck am I saying?
[255:06.79]Is... There's... There really is no right answer.
[255:14.58]If you're stuck creatively, or if you want to go through more creative stuff in your life, you kind of just have to... You kind of have to make it happen.
[255:22.77]You know?
[255:27.49]And you said starting is the hardest part.
[255:30.05]Starting is probably the hardest part, but an equally difficult part is continuing to do things that you want to do.
[255:37.20]And not letting roadblocks get in the way.
[255:41.16]Because they will.
[255:41.86]It'll happen.
[255:43.80]But you also have to remember that you don't have to do something just because you think you do.
[255:51.49]You know, there's plenty of things that I wanted to do in my life that I didn't do.
[255:56.14]that I wanted to do.
[255:58.22]And you just, you have to make sure that you have a few different interests so that when at least one of them works out, then you're happy.
[256:08.53]Roblox in the way.
[256:17.20]But you just want to make sure that you have, like I said, we've kind of gone over it a couple times, and that's my opinion on it, is make sure that you have a few interests that you would be happy with.
[256:27.18]And pursue them.
[256:29.00]If one sticks, great.
[256:30.36]Awesome.
[256:31.78]If the others don't, you have more than one interest, right?
[256:36.95]I'm not saying that streaming is one of those things, but it could be anything.
[256:43.93]Just become the number one Roblox streamer.
[256:51.21]You can do that.
[256:53.07]But I wish you the best in life.
[256:55.19]I wish you the best luck in whatever you're doing.
[257:01.00]Just try.
[257:01.74]As long as you try, as long as you have a few things that you like, give them all a try.
[257:07.22]You never know.
[257:09.26]But thank you for the $1, Haley.
[257:11.17]Thank you for the $1 to Robot Mentality.
[257:14.35]Thank you.
[257:15.93]No message or anything, but just a dollar.
[257:17.65]Thank you.
[257:19.35]Getting close to the end here, we've got King of Acorns for $5.
[257:21.83]Hey, Jerma, my name is Austin.
[257:23.55]I'm a long-time viewer of the streams.
[257:25.42]Thanks for all the laughs.
[257:26.30]You are awesome.
[257:27.58]Never stop doing what you're doing.
[257:28.94]Also, can I get a birthday shout-out?
[257:31.06]Yeah.
[257:33.04]Happy birthday, King of Acorns.
[257:35.22]Happy 23rd birthday.
[257:36.32]23?
[257:39.36]And then say, LOL, thanks.
[257:42.28]You're welcome.
[257:43.42]Hope you have a great one.
[257:46.66]Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the $1.00.
[257:50.07]Please explain this.
[257:53.39]It's a freeze frame of... I don't know what that is.
[257:57.63]Those are green eyes?
[257:59.31]You doctored that photo.
[258:03.45]Thank you for the $1, though.
[258:05.01]$2, actually.
[258:09.09]Emooch, thanks for the $1.
[258:10.15]Hey, Jerma, much love, and I'm always happy to support the channel.
[258:13.83]I really appreciate it.
[258:17.04]Thank you.
[258:19.24]Uh, MailValo, thanks for the $4.
[258:21.34]Hey Jerma, recently changed my alias, used to be FGWGWF.
[258:25.48]Not sure if you remember me, I do.
[258:27.30]Figured it was time for an actual username and not one that I got from slapping my keyboard.
[258:34.86]While on the subject, I remember you talking briefly in a TF2 video like four years ago, how you got your alias, because your name is Jeremy.
[258:43.09]Is it inspired by anything though?
[258:45.85]No.
[258:48.37]Just kind of an easy nickname that I was called and kind of just stuck.
[258:56.91]But thank you for the four dollars.
[258:58.91]Oh, great name change.
[259:02.49]Hey Tingy, thanks for two bucks.
[259:03.67]Hey, here's two bucks for express shipping on those shirts.
[259:06.78]If you can give Teespring a call and let them know I paid extra, that'd be nice.
[259:13.96]I'm not in control of the shipping.
[259:16.30]That will be on Teespring.
[259:18.50]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the three dollars.
[259:19.90]Not sure if this was brought up, but your headaches might be caused by straining your eyes on the screen.
[259:23.02]Have you considered getting your eyes checked?
[259:25.46]Feel better, man.
[259:27.68]Ah, but first of all, thanks for the three bucks.
[259:28.96]Second of all, I've had my eyes checked.
[259:30.58]I had an eye exam last year.
[259:32.60]Everything is good to go.
[259:34.18]It's... I've had headaches my whole life.
[259:38.28]I actually got diagnosed with migraines.
[259:40.32]I had to take Imitrex for a little while.
[259:43.08]I had an Imitrex nasal spray.
[259:46.22]But I didn't like taking it anymore.
[259:47.56]I didn't like what it did.
[259:50.41]So... Last year?
[259:52.31]Well, I mean, it's 2019.
[259:53.81]I'm talking like 2018.
[259:55.83]Probably like four or five months ago.
[260:01.65]But, yeah.
[260:03.27]It's just something that happens sometimes.
[260:05.48]And I've had... I've had like CT scans of my head to make sure there's nothing really going on.
[260:13.77]But it might be worth another conversation because it's really annoying.
[260:22.42]The spray gets you high.
[260:25.14]No, it just like shuts you off.
[260:26.72]It's weird.
[260:30.24]And when I would do, when I would get a bad migraine and I would do an Imitrex, you're supposed to do it right when the headache comes on.
[260:35.35]Right at the onset of a real migraine, you're supposed to do it.
[260:39.07]But man, it would shut me off for like four days.
[260:42.13]I would be just turned the fuck off.
[260:45.53]Groggy, messed up, sloppy, slippery.
[260:48.37]I would be like for at least three, four days.
[260:49.97]I hated it.
[260:57.86]But do not be concerned.
[261:01.84]I know that sometimes when I talk about medical stuff, people go, oh, fuck.
[261:05.45]Are you alright?
[261:06.17]I'm just like, no, I'm fine.
[261:07.09]I'm fine.
[261:07.71]Don't worry.
[261:10.43]Don't worry about me.
[261:12.97]Everything's going to be just fine.
[261:16.79]But thank you, Freudian.
[261:17.63]Thank you, Robot Mentality for the $1.
[261:19.40]Thank you, Kinky Lil Poo Poo for the $5.
[261:25.33]I'm gonna... I can't laugh at that.
[261:26.61]I don't know what that is.
[261:28.09]I don't know what that means.
[261:29.31]What the fuck did I just read?
[261:30.23]Thank you for the five dollars.
[261:31.17]Thank you, Keldos, for the one dollar.
[261:34.07]I swear this is not a gnome.
[261:37.17]It's a Vinesauce animated thing.
[261:46.81]Uh... Clip it.
[261:51.23]It's a Vinny animated geese.
[261:56.40]You wanna hear it again?
[261:57.02]Alright, here's the whole video.
[262:07.15]The video's like two minutes long.
[262:09.09]I'm just kidding.
[262:11.37]But thank you for the video.
[262:15.21]Thank you, Kinky, for the $1.
[262:17.11]I forgot to send a link, but I clipped the video of you killing a dog and uploading it.
[262:21.34]What?
[262:21.52]Oh, we're talking about in the game.
[262:24.86]What the fuck?
[262:32.50]This is like a broken link.
[262:34.74]I can't even click this.
[262:36.94]There's like five spaces in here.
[262:47.77]Why did you type W space W?
[262:49.71]Why did you do all the spaces?
[263:02.38]W space W. Alright, so what is this?
[263:07.77]What the hell did you just give me as a link here?
[263:12.39]You put a space between you and tube.
[263:19.49]You guys wanna know what it was?
[263:21.03]What do you think it was?
[263:22.24]Yeah.
[263:22.68]Yeah.
[263:29.12]That's, like, next level.
[263:30.24]Alright, thank you for the dollar.
[263:34.13]Uh, thank you, Dr. Zoot, suit for the one dollar.
[263:36.07]Jeremiah, I finished drawing female you.
[263:38.07]I have sinned.
[263:39.65]Whatever.
[263:41.23]Thank you for the one dollar.
[263:42.03]Thank you, Lord Muffins, for the one dollar.
[263:43.57]Hey, Jeremiah, I've been a fan for 25 years.
[263:46.78]I would love it if you would light by... I'm not doing either of those things.
[263:53.44]Thank you for the one dollar, Lord Muffin.
[263:56.24]wizard ribbit thanks for the one dollar need to wear gunner optics to avoid gamer headache no that's not what it is thank you though thank you jess for the one dollar I've been keeping a library of all the sounds you've made since the start of the year was gonna keep it all I was gonna keep it up all year but it's actually way more than I thought I have 270 sounds that's too many sounds
[264:24.32]That's more sounds than are in the Star Wars trilogy.
[264:29.61]You're in a tantrum.
[264:30.51]What is this?
[264:45.22]That was pretty fucking close.
[264:46.66]I haven't heard that since the stream.
[264:48.30]That was really close.
[264:49.26]That was really good.
[264:52.42]That was on the spot.
[264:53.76]No practice.
[265:02.54]But thank you, though, Jess.
[265:03.26]Thank you something or other for the $1 Euro germs.
[265:05.70]I apologize this one hasn't come up before.
[265:08.21]Would you ever consider doing a Jerma Rumble with community-submitted characters in bios?
[265:12.31]Seems like a train wreck.
[265:15.81]Probably not.
[265:20.14]Probably not like a Community Rumble.
[265:22.38]Because I think that would get a little messy.
[265:25.74]Great Canadian FK Club, thanks for five more Community Subs.
[265:33.05]On top of the countless amount that you currently have, thank you so much.
[265:37.95]But a Community Rumble would get messy for the same reasons that I think a lot of stuff like that has a tendency to get messy.
[265:45.19]Because let's say that there was, you know, 10 contestants or like 5, 20 contestants or something that I'd be accepting.
[265:53.71]You know, not picking somebody's if there's like hundreds of entries.
[265:56.37]I don't want to make it like a competition.
[266:02.86]The emote contest was the last real competition in quotes.
[266:07.94]And it was handled pretty well.
[266:12.36]But I don't want to make a whole lot of competitions.
[266:21.50]Mod Rumble.
[266:26.71]But it's an interesting idea.
[266:29.47]But I don't want to have a situation where it's like, You picked this and not mine?
[266:33.65]What the fuck?
[266:34.35]That one sucks!
[266:35.63]And then people get angry and you're like, well, uh... Stuff like that is hard to make everybody happy.
[266:49.38]And I've learned a lot over the years of trying to get them to do it, trying to get it to happen the right way and how would I want to do stuff like that.
[266:56.69]I've done it a couple times.
[267:02.75]But I do like the idea.
[267:05.21]Just the execution would need to be done correctly.
[267:08.27]But thank you.
[267:10.66]Thank you to Guido for the $1.
[267:14.72]I used to get those headaches a bunch, too.
[267:16.19]Went away after I got these glasses that help with the eye strain.
[267:18.93]Maybe you should try it.
[267:20.57]I mean, it's worth a shot.
[267:23.83]I think a long time ago when I was doing YouTube and sitting in front of a screen for a long time, it did help to wear, like, to have, like, flux on or have, like, optics on.
[267:35.49]Maybe I'll go back to doing it again.
[267:41.09]But I do appreciate it.
[267:42.17]Thank you.
[267:43.35]Flying Sombrero, thanks for the $1.
[267:44.65]Hey, Jerma, I was talking with this girl I recently met about our favorite YouTubers and streamers.
[267:48.65]I mentioned that you were my favorite streamer and she stopped talking to me.
[267:51.43]Thanks.
[267:53.17]Well, good.
[267:54.69]Because that wasn't a keeper.
[267:59.62]You know what I'm saying?
[268:09.82]Thank you for the $1.
[268:12.64]Thank you, MomThePeach, for the $1 sub today and looking forward to the future.
[268:16.60]Hope your head feels better.
[268:17.84]Thank you, appreciate that.
[268:18.66]I'm gonna take some Advil and just relax.
[268:23.12]And we're gonna try again tomorrow.
[268:26.49]Krusty Earwax, thanks for the $1.
[268:28.15]I don't know if referencing JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is still a joke, but you should play one of the shitty JoJo games.
[268:33.47]And then they do like the, I don't know, but whatever.
[268:39.86]There was one on Dreamcast that I hovered over the purchase button and realized that it got ported.
[268:44.48]I'm not kidding.
[268:46.68]Didn't buy it, though.
[268:48.17]Thank you, Awesome Stevie, for the $1.
[268:50.03]Okay, you are epic.
[268:53.13]Thank you.
[268:54.85]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[268:56.71]We talked about Joel challenging me.
[268:58.33]I already accepted the challenge.
[269:01.15]Invader Z, thanks for the $2.
[269:03.49]I was finally able to make a stream.
[269:04.99]Thank you so much, Jerma.
[269:05.85]You're awesome and you always make me laugh.
[269:09.47]Welcome to the stream.
[269:10.40]Glad you made it.
[269:11.02]Sorry it was a short one.
[269:13.78]Thank you, Breenland, for the one dollar.
[269:15.32]Hey, yo, are you gonna play Kingdom Hearts 1, 2, and 3?
[269:17.60]Uh, I'd say all of them, but it'd never finish.
[269:23.92]Um, no, that's like 6,000 hours.
[269:28.09]I don't think I'm gonna play Kingdom Hearts 3 on stream, or 1, or 2.
[269:31.74]But I hope you enjoy it when it releases in, uh, like, less than 24 hours.
[269:37.56]So, have a great playthrough of Kingdom Hearts 3.
[269:45.34]I heard it's pretty good.
[269:48.44]Thank you for the suggestion, but probably not on this channel.
[269:52.18]Hey, Tingy, thanks for the two bucks.
[269:53.38]I see how this is gonna happen.
[269:54.45]Sliding more bits under the table.
[269:55.75]Will this do?
[269:56.37]Wink.
[269:57.81]You can't pay me to do anything.
[270:01.97]Thank you, Double D, for the $1.
[270:02.79]Hey, Jerma, could you please assist me in identifying this man?
[270:06.29]He's been tormenting me for months.
[270:08.67]He keeps rambling on something about playing Army of Two with his college.
[270:11.27]It's a picture of Etalyx.
[270:15.04]Thank you.
[270:15.90]Subwab, thank you for the $10.
[270:20.42]Jerma, figuring out the person I want to be in life has been difficult, but I want to let you know you've been a huge inspiration.
[270:25.44]You're a real hero to me, so thanks for all the good times.
[270:29.49]If I can inspire somebody to do anything positive, then I'm fucking honored.
[270:35.83]Thank you.
[270:38.76]Thank you for even saying that.
[270:41.30]I hope you, whatever you take from me, whatever that is, hope you have it positively affect your life.
[270:49.07]Seriously, thank you.
[270:51.35]And thank you for the $10.
[270:54.30]Thank you, Dr. Plato, for the one dollar.
[270:56.62]Don't know if you're gonna see this, but I've had constant headaches and migraines recently.
[271:00.98]Currently in the Navy, so it's straining.
[271:03.15]I get where you're coming from, and getting headaches every day is so hard to deal with.
[271:06.31]I've gotten an MRI, but came back clean.
[271:08.41]Honestly don't know what to do about it.
[271:11.97]Yeah, for me, for me they come in like strings.
[271:16.23]Like, I will go to bed with a headache, wake up groggy and fucked up and feel, like, slow and headachy.
[271:22.59]And then another day, like, it's like an eye pain headache.
[271:25.59]And then, like, a back of the head headache.
[271:27.05]And then it's gone for three months.
[271:29.59]It's weird.
[271:31.57]I feel like I'm currently, like, in the thick of that right now.
[271:36.65]But I'm really sorry to hear about your struggles there.
[271:39.71]Hopefully you can figure out some kind of solution.
[271:42.66]Because that, it sucks.
[271:43.50]It does.
[271:43.76]It's annoying.
[271:48.43]I wish you the best.
[271:49.97]Thank you for the $1.
[271:51.99]Only a few more here.
[271:52.69]Thank you, Solid Milk, for the $1.
[271:56.41]Should I try to ask a girl I've been friends with out for a while?
[271:59.97]Wait, hold on.
[272:00.95]Let me read this again.
[272:02.48]I've been wondering if I should try to ask a girl I've been friends with for a while, but I don't want to ruin our friendship.
[272:09.06]Oh, okay.
[272:09.68]So you ask a girl out that you've been friends with for a while.
[272:15.43]I don't know.
[272:16.14]I can't give you an answer there.
[272:18.08]Because I have no idea what your relationship is like.
[272:20.56]I don't know how long you've known this person.
[272:23.78]Plus, I'm terrible with relationship advice.
[272:26.70]I'm definitely not somebody good to ask stuff like this.
[272:34.75]Remember to make sure not to tell her that you know me.
[272:36.97]That you, like, not know me, but that you watch me.
[272:40.73]So how well that goes.
[272:46.28]But without being able to gauge kind of the whole situation, it'd be really easy for me to be like, yeah, go for it!
[272:52.26]But I have no idea.
[272:53.00]You know, and I don't want to be the person that gives you the wrong info.
[272:57.66]And then it's like, why the fuck did Jerma tell me to do that?
[273:02.21]So I'm not really that great with relationship advice.
[273:04.15]I, uh... I do wish you luck in your romantic endeavors.
[273:17.08]But remember, if somebody wants to just be friends, if you figure that out... And that's, you know, you... I know people that have... You gotta be careful because I've known of people before where they were friends for a long time and then somebody tried to put the line out there.
[273:34.18]They're like, hey, maybe we could be more than just friends.
[273:37.81]And then it makes it awkward and you go apart.
[273:41.97]So that's possible.
[273:42.99]I mean, it depends on what your friendship is like.
[273:45.51]But you just have to be careful.
[273:54.09]My Tinder pickup line is, hey baby, you watched Jerma985.
[273:57.83]He beat Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls 3.
[274:07.27]No, but I wish I could give you better advice.
[274:09.33]But there are much better resources than me.
[274:13.19]But thank you, though.
[274:14.11]Good luck.
[274:15.84]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[274:16.68]It's really fucking impossible to lose an animal.
[274:19.44]I think you've got a picture here of...
[274:45.98]Is this a photo of the dog?
[274:50.22]Let's see.
[274:54.40]Let's take a look.
[274:57.04]Is it a golden retriever?
[275:09.05]Oh, she's beautiful.
[275:13.13]I'm really sorry to hear about that.
[275:16.53]Yeah, she was.
[275:23.76]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[275:27.90]Take care of yourself.
[275:29.90]Much love to you.
[275:31.00]And I don't know what your dog's name was, but rest in peace, for sure.
[275:39.99]Thank you for the $1 up, Quark.
[275:43.42]Also, thank you to Chubby Funster for the $1.
[275:44.90]Hey Jerma, you're really cute and funny.
[275:48.52]How come you don't grow out your beard?
[275:49.84]You'd look really good with one, I think, unless you got something against beards, which I don't think I could support a beard-hating streamer if that were the case.
[275:56.05]Love you lots.
[275:58.75]Uh... No, my facial hair doesn't grow out full.
[276:02.97]It's bad.
[276:04.01]It looks like shit.
[276:05.53]It's very patchy and scraggly.
[276:07.61]It's not full.
[276:08.14]It looks bad.
[276:08.92]That's why I never do it.
[276:10.82]But thank you.
[276:12.37]Thank you Nebula Brand for the $15.
[276:13.93]Fifteen.
[276:16.37]Thank you.
[276:19.49]Hey Jerm, I just want to say that even though we've never met, watching your streams always feels like hanging out with an old friend.
[276:23.80]2018 was a hard year for me for a lot of reasons, but even when I only had 20 bucks in my bank account, I couldn't unsub from you.
[276:31.78]I don't know how I would have gotten through the second half of 2018 if I didn't have your streams to come home to every other day.
[276:37.25]Thank you for bringing so much laughter to my life, and here's to a much happier 2019.
[276:42.86]Hell yeah.
[276:44.53]Here's to 2019.
[276:45.05]Thank you so much, Nebula Brand.
[276:52.41]I'm really sorry to hear about your struggles.
[276:59.01]Much love to you.
[276:59.75]Thank you for everything.
[277:02.01]Thanks for sticking around.
[277:03.87]I hope you have a solid 2019.
[277:05.39]Thank you.
[277:13.17]Thank you, Wizard Ribbit, for the two bucks.
[277:15.83]Drink some brain fluid for a healthy brain.
[277:19.24]It probably gives you headaches.
[277:23.46]Tingy, thanks for the two bucks.
[277:24.70]Man, you're one tough customer.
[277:26.14]Wait, I'm the customer.
[277:27.52]What the hell's going on here?
[277:28.40]Fine, I'll just have to get them the good old-fashioned American way.
[277:33.70]No.
[277:36.91]Thank you, DrZootSuit, for the one dollar.
[277:38.77]I realize I didn't have the link.
[277:41.55]Link, what is this?
[277:50.77]Oh.
[277:51.35]Oh, okay.
[277:52.01]Alright.
[277:52.50]Oh.
[277:53.58]Right.
[277:55.06]Oh.
[277:55.94]Well.
[277:57.22]Alright.
[277:58.12]There it is.
[278:01.46]Thank you, Dr. Zoot Suit, for the $1.
[278:02.82]Thank you, Meme Machine, for the $2.
[278:05.20]Solid Milk, $1.
[278:07.51]I fucked up the grammar, but thanks.
[278:08.75]I'll be sure to tell her I watched you.
[278:10.39]Oh, God.
[278:13.01]Oh, God.
[278:15.39]Thank you for the $1 solid milk.
[278:17.25]Good luck.
[278:18.89]Thank you to... Thank you, Django, for the $5.
[278:24.33]You're a good guy, Jerma.
[278:25.18]Thanks for all the great streams.
[278:26.18]Have a good night.
[278:26.90]You as well.
[278:28.12]Thank you so much for the $5.
[278:29.20]Appreciate the kind words.
[278:32.86]Double D, thanks for the $1.
[278:33.96]Please share this photo with the stream.
[278:35.28]Anyone who sees this must have to report... It's just... It's Etalyx again.
[278:41.10]What are you doing?
[278:44.49]He's 1,200 Jerma Bucks for the... Etalyx was last seen on the Vegas strip with an extremely short streamer.
[278:49.87]That's very, very... That's not probably more than me.
[278:52.83]There are plenty of other streamers that this could be who are small.
[278:56.61]Not me, though.
[278:57.45]I'm average small.
[278:58.65]I'm small, but I'm average.

[280:24.28]And finally, quarter dime for the $1.
[280:25.74]Hey, Jeremiah, I know this might sound weird, but I actually enjoy the spam memes.
[280:30.76]Can we just get a good five minutes out of them before they get shut down?
[280:34.89]What do you mean shut down?
[280:39.57]Shut down?
[280:40.27]No, there's no spam.
[280:43.79]I'm not going to encourage spam on this channel, unless there's a PogChamp moment when I'm going to say that on stream.
[280:50.54]But here are the subs and the resubs for tonight.
[280:54.49]A ton of community subs.
[280:55.61]A ton of money.
[280:57.43]I, again, just want to apologize for another, like, five-hour stream.
[281:01.75]Or four-hour, and then, you know, this part.
[281:05.01]We'll come back.
[281:05.51]We'll try to get tomorrow strong.
[281:07.77]If you're just joining us, I just, like, got another one of those fucking weird, like, tired headache things.
[281:13.76]Last time, it just, I got, like, just sleepy.
[281:17.57]But I'm actually feeling some, like, pain and pressure here.
[281:20.32]So... Annoying, but I have to deal with it.
[281:23.64]I'm sorry.
[281:24.26]It's just the way it is.
[281:27.04]See you guys tomorrow.

[281:38.67]And then they actually put a smiley face.
[281:46.42]See you tomorrow.
[281:55.15]Smiley face.
[281:58.95]Yeah, there was, there was a, let me see how many community subs came in from earlier.

[282:17.21]Great Canadian.
[282:19.67]Great Canadian.
[282:23.37]You guys are significant.
[282:24.39]You have a significant amount of subs come from a lot of... A lot of people that are here now, so thank you guys.
[282:30.59]You mean like, restream a stream and then do DVD commentary?
[282:34.56]How many emotes slots do we have now?
[282:38.96]It's probably so many.
[282:40.02]Let me see.
[282:53.90]At least another ten.
[282:54.78]I already had, like, I still had like five or six that were still open.
[282:59.11]Gonna have to come up with some more emotes.
[283:07.63]See a doctor for the headaches?
[283:08.97]I have, don't worry, I have seen a doctor.
[283:13.96]I have.
[283:15.20]I actually have been getting all kinds of checkups and tests over the last three or four weeks.
[283:22.19]So, I'm in the process, don't worry.
[283:27.77]Let's see the Bitcoin doctor.
[283:31.33]I don't think that's real.
[283:41.14]If it is, that's pretty ridiculous.
[283:46.98]But take care, guys.
[283:49.10]I'm going to go relax.
[283:51.22]And we'll go again tomorrow.
[283:52.92]Hopefully I can finish Resident Evil 2 tomorrow.
[283:56.54]See you guys very soon.
[283:58.49]Take care.
[283:58.91]Much love.
[283:59.55]See you soon.
[284:00.01]Have a great night.
[284:02.15]Goodbye.
