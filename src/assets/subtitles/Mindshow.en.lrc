[00:01.98]Hey.
[00:04.52]Sorry I didn't start.
[00:07.28]Sorry, I got lost in the mail.
[00:12.07]I thought I could get myself shipped here in a timely matter, but I got lost in the fucking mail.
[00:20.09]What is this?
[00:20.67]Get this out of here.
[00:23.32]But I bid you hello.
[00:26.54]Hope you had a good couple of days, three days here.
[00:30.28]Speaking of three days, we are going to do three days.
[00:34.76]That's one, two, three in a row of virtual reality.
[00:40.42]We're going to start today with Mind Show.
[00:43.63]If you don't know what Mind Show is, well, I'll tell you.
[00:49.79]You get in that headset and you act out scenes from movies that you make in your mind.
[00:59.97]I'm gonna show you guys some of my acting chops.
[01:04.33]What's wrong with my desk?
[01:05.47]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:06.61]What is this?
[01:06.98]Why is there like goo on this desk?
[01:10.76]What the fuck is this?
[01:11.66]I use coasters every time.
[01:13.18]I need to get like some desk cleaner.
[01:17.46]Oh, that sucks.
[01:18.42]What the fuck is this?
[01:25.09]I'm not happy about that.
[01:27.33]Someone's in fucking deep shit.
[01:30.10]I don't know who did that.
[01:33.48]Very deep fucking shit, though.
[01:34.64]Let's see who comes in this room.
[01:40.01]Me?
[01:42.37]Anybody else come in this room?
[01:45.91]No, just me.
[01:47.92]You're in big trouble!
[01:50.36]I'm sorry!
[01:50.92]I didn't mean to not use a coaster!
[01:52.26]Use a coaster next time!
[01:53.70]Every time!
[01:54.62]Not next time!
[01:55.48]Every time!
[02:00.62]No, not the top row!
[02:03.64]Anyways, let's turn the camera on.
[02:06.98]No, not yet.
[02:08.44]I don't like that.
[02:09.28]I don't want to be on camera yet.
[02:10.88]Not until I've had my coffee.
[02:13.26]Because I have to finish it.
[02:18.67]You know what?
[02:18.97]Fine, fuck it.
[02:19.45]Let's just get on camera.
[02:26.63]That, like, ultra gamer hunch.
[02:29.27]Did you see that?
[02:31.88]That was almost like somebody was holding me up by my neck.
[02:34.83]Like this, like pinching.
[02:38.41]twitch.tv!
[02:39.05]I got a Twitch shirt on today.
[02:40.89]Just in case you didn't know where you were.
[02:47.34]I got the influencer shirt on.
[02:49.60]The thing is though, it's incredibly light.
[02:51.74]So it allows me to go like this.
[02:54.34]I had to prepare for this straighter.
[02:57.16]Guys, I've been walking.
[02:59.11]I've been taking walks to prepare for this day.
[03:01.96]Remember last time I streamed VR?
[03:04.24]I kept going like this, like... No, I've been, like, moving.
[03:12.26]It's been great.
[03:15.07]I've been taking, like, a 40-minute walk every day.
[03:17.87]I'm dead serious.
[03:18.55]That's not a joke.
[03:20.29]This is not one of those scenarios where, like, Jeremy says something completely fucking untrue, and then we laugh about it in 40 minutes.
[03:26.36]No.
[03:28.96]I'm staying active.
[03:30.32]Get active.
[03:33.84]Facial hair?
[03:37.48]Yeah, I mean, I just... I just didn't care.
[03:43.07]I was thinking... Here's the thing.
[03:45.59]Help me out here.
[03:46.95]How many of you guys hate the way that you look with a freshly shaved face?
[03:54.17]I hate it.
[03:56.27]I need like two days after shaving before I'm happy with what's going on up here.
[04:02.67]I don't like it.
[04:04.11]So what happens is I know that I have to shave but I know that if I shave I'm gonna get that weird like crystal face.
[04:13.31]I don't like it.
[04:14.51]So I usually try to wait like a day or two and then it's been like four days and then four days turns into five and then it gets hard to do
[04:25.29]Just trim it?
[04:26.33]No, I have an ugly fucking beard.
[04:27.71]Look at this.
[04:28.09]Like this is... I grow facial hair here, and like here, and then here.
[04:33.45]I don't grow facial hair here.
[04:39.96]It just looks like coal.
[04:44.32]Shaggy, yeah.
[04:45.48]It doesn't look good.
[04:47.28]I know people that can grow big thick beards up here.
[04:49.72]No, not me.
[04:51.75]I'm lucky if I get, and if you look up close, I'm not gonna do it because some people might be eating, so I'm not gonna do that.
[04:56.38]But up close, see from here, this is just, oh, he's just got like a little beard today.
[05:01.82]If I go up close, you can see every individual disgusting hair, and I know some of you are probably snacking, so I don't want to make you throw up.
[05:11.55]Anyways, why don't we go ahead and get this started.
[05:15.49]I've been here long enough, let me just, hold on, I gotta finish my coffee.
[05:18.89]Let me get this nice dog mug.
[05:25.86]You want to see it?
[05:26.46]You really want to see this?
[05:29.13]Alright, fine.
[05:30.65]I'm going to give you a fair warning.
[05:33.03]If you've got, like, a Bolognese in front of you, put the fork down, get the bib off, and just go like this.
[05:40.46]You don't want to see this.
[05:56.14]You see?
[05:59.91]This looks like I glued on hair on my face.
[06:02.63]See what I'm talking about?
[06:10.03]It looks like I went to the barber, right?
[06:13.03]I went to like the hair salon and like I'm just like crawling on the ground.
[06:17.51]They're like cutting people's hair and I'm just like picking up pieces and going like, oh, that's a good one.
[06:21.78]I like put that in my pocket and then I get home and I like glue them on.
[06:27.73]It doesn't... It's alright.
[06:32.63]He's covering the zit.
[06:36.22]No, I was stretching my... Look, there's two there!
[06:38.88]I'm a human, okay?
[06:41.74]Some people want to pretend that they don't look like shit sometimes.
[06:44.14]I'm a human!
[06:46.45]Humans look like shit!
[06:48.09]That's just the way it is, alright?
[06:50.31]So for those of you that have trouble seeing a guy with a pimple right here... Humans are gross.
[06:55.69]That's all you need to know.
[07:03.54]Do you know how many gross things your body does on a daily basis?
[07:09.70]Alright, no, no, no, let's go, let's go.
[07:12.44]I'm done with this shit.
[07:13.90]I'm picking up my VR headset.
[07:15.24]I don't wanna, I gotta like get started.
[07:19.98]I don't wanna talk about every gross thing that we do.
[07:22.68]Saliva, think about it.
[07:25.13]Inside of your mouth right now is a viscous liquid that is never ending and always is produced.
[07:31.57]That's disgusting, that's gross.
[07:34.14]When are we going to get the ability to, like, sap the DNA from trees?
[07:38.68]And I just want to become a tree person.
[07:40.17]I actually was talking to Kim about this two days ago, so she can vouch for it, I swear to God.
[07:43.43]I was talking about trees, and how, like, I want to be, like, a tree.
[07:51.95]You had to be there, alright?
[07:53.03]You had to be there.
[07:55.92]Because trees don't have, like, oh, fucking nerd neck.
[08:03.67]Anyways, here we go.
[08:12.70]Let's get in here.
[08:13.50]I gotta get, hold on.
[08:14.22]Let me get these on first.
[08:15.12]Is this the right?
[08:16.26]Is this the right hand?
[08:23.68]I don't know.
[08:25.41]No, okay, this is right because you guys are on left.
[08:31.12]We were talking about, I can't even explain it.
[08:33.10]That's for like a Monster Rancher type stream, right?
[08:36.10]Let's talk for 40 minutes of how I wish I could be a tree.
[08:42.07]That's the title of a book.
[08:45.71]Are we sure that like Shel Silverstein didn't write this poem?
[08:49.83]I think he may have.
[08:53.92]I really think that exists.
[08:57.06]Is this going to work?
[09:00.52]What's going on here?
[09:02.56]Alright, I'm going in.
[09:03.52]This is Mind Show.
[09:04.22]Can you guys hear this?
[09:06.02]I hope so.
[09:06.38]You're going to have to tell me no.
[09:10.14]It's been a while.
[09:12.22]So give me a break.
[09:14.80]I don't know.
[09:15.26]Never mind.
[09:15.66]I was going to say, never mind.
[09:18.92]I'm all over the place today.
[09:20.34]But it's probably a good thing.
[09:23.55]I'm happy.
[09:24.29]It's a happy day.
[09:28.32]Oh, and before we get started, I want to show you this.

[09:52.81]It's a fucking lemonade relaxer.
[10:07.41]Here we go.
[10:09.81]Yes, I know I'm stalling.
[10:11.70]And I'm going to continue to stall because you know how fucking bad I get in here?
[10:17.44]My, like, light flashes before my eyes after two hours in VR.
[10:23.12]Oh, T-pose!

[25:04.37]Hop in, right?
[25:06.67]Hop in.
[25:11.85]Is this like protected?

[26:33.05]Okay, I'm ready.
[26:33.51]Ahem.
[26:38.75]There's the cell phone that you were looking for.
[26:41.87]How else do we fucking get in there, huh?
[26:46.10]I think if you have a brick or something, we could throw the brick through the window and steal the phone.
[26:51.88]That's my idea.
[26:53.42]You are swearing way too much.
[26:56.94]I did not raise you like this.
[26:58.52]I did not raise you like this.
[26:59.46]You swear too much.
[27:00.46]Your mother says the same thing.
[27:01.92]You're going to go to jail one day.
[27:12.07]The deadest, uh, cell phone that you've been looking for.
[27:14.43]Why don't you fucking break in, you fucking idiot?
[27:16.53]How else do we fucking get in there, huh?
[27:19.22]If you have a brick or something, we can throw the brick through the window and steal the phone.
[27:23.94]I don't think I fucking care.
[27:26.12]It's a new fucking phone.
[27:27.08]You see that shit over there, man?
[27:28.22]That's the fucking new iPhone 25.
[27:30.06]I did not raise you like this.
[27:31.64]I did not raise you like this.
[27:32.58]You swear too much.
[27:33.56]Your mother says the same thing.
[27:34.94]Fuck yeah, dude.
[27:35.56]Let's fucking do it.
[27:38.38]You're going to go to jail one day.
[27:40.62]What?
[27:44.62]Let's remix this fucking one too.
[27:48.48]We got that one.
[27:56.06]It is the cell phone that you were looking for.
[28:06.76]Yes.
[28:07.60]Cell phone in here.
[28:08.94]Heavy wants cell phone.
[28:16.29]That's good idea.
[28:17.73]Let me try.
[28:18.35]I will break door down with... You're swearing way too much.
[28:21.78]I did not raise you like this.
[28:23.10]Swear.
[28:23.42]I did not raise you like this.
[28:24.32]You swear too much.
[28:25.16]When did I swear?
[28:27.36]I will crush puny man with fingers and squeeze.
[28:31.39]I'm kind of doing Reinhardt right now at the beginning.
[28:34.05]Alright, whatever.
[28:37.06]What?
[29:15.79]No, I don't want to be a scream stream.
[29:20.21]God damn it.
[29:22.11]I'm sorry for everybody.
[29:23.49]Just lower the volume a little.
[29:39.92]Just a cell phone that you were looking for.
[29:43.95]I told you to be ready for it, I'm sorry.
[30:15.74]It is the cell phone that you were looking for.
[30:19.00]Yes, cell phone in here.
[30:21.18]Heavy, one cell phone.
[30:23.02]I think if you have a brick or something, you can shrewdly shrewdly... That's a good idea.
[30:29.96]Let me try.
[30:31.12]I will break door down.
[30:32.26]You're swearing way too much.
[30:33.86]I did not raise you like this.
[30:35.44]I did not raise you like this.
[30:36.38]You swear too much.
[30:37.36]When did I swear?
[30:39.58]I will crush puny man.
[30:40.98]Please, I'm begging you.
[30:47.10]This is fucking terrible.
[30:48.98]Can I delete this character forever?
[30:51.24]I'm not going to do that.
[30:52.00]You're going to blow my vocal cords out if I have to put him in every single scene.
[30:59.12]And he just has my voice.
[31:00.48]He doesn't even have a cool voice.
[31:11.31]By the way, I'm just coming to a realization here.
[31:14.33]This is part two of somebody's story that they made.
[31:19.89]I just came in the middle.
[31:21.59]Okay, this person's making a cake.
[31:23.83]And the cake is, it's got eggs, it's got baking soda, it's got vanilla extract.
[31:28.48]I just walked in.
[31:29.76]They went to the bathroom.
[31:31.46]And I came in here and I just dumped in like a bunch of gravy.
[31:34.50]And just fucking shook it up and left the house.
[31:37.82]That's seriously what I did.
[31:40.16]Okay.
[31:41.16]Uh, I don't think I can add any more people.
[31:45.64]Let's watch it one more time, then we'll move on.
[31:47.62]It's just a cell phone that you were looking for.
[31:50.78]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:54.30]Remix.
[31:55.33]Remix.
[31:55.69]Get me in here.
[31:56.95]Get me in here.
[31:57.39]We're redoing this one.
[32:04.77]It's just a cell phone that you were looking for.
[32:07.27]Yes.
[32:08.69]Cell phone in here.
[32:11.70]That's good idea.
[32:17.81]Let me try.
[32:19.73]I will break the door down.
[32:21.29]You say it's way too much right now.
[32:22.89]I did not raise you like this.
[32:23.90]I did not raise you like this.
[32:25.42]You swear your mother says this too.
[32:36.58]There's a cell phone that you were looking for.
[32:39.70]Yes.
[32:40.61]I'm fucking outta here.
[32:42.31]I'm outta here.
[33:10.80]I'm out of this.
[33:11.62]I'm done.
[33:13.14]That was bad.
[33:13.88]What?
[33:14.04]What happened to mine?
[33:15.16]Oh, I went back.
[33:15.62]Why is it always a little kid?
[33:16.93]It's always a kid.
[33:24.31]Why is the...
[33:39.54]Why is the biggest guy always like the little kid?
[33:42.85]Oh, that sucks.
[33:43.57]Well, there's a new phone.
[33:44.73]How do we get in to get it?
[33:46.43]You break the window.
[33:48.37]Alright.
[33:48.85]I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[33:54.96]What else is there?
[33:55.74]I love this.

[34:15.24]Space Trek, part three.
[34:18.83]Let's get in this one, watch this.
[34:25.95]Make them all screaming letters.
[34:27.45]Guys, you want this stream to be like 45 minutes long?
[34:32.41]Is that what you want?
[34:34.00]Because the more that I scream as loud as I can, the more it's gonna be over in like less than two hours.
[34:42.53]Alright, here we go.
[34:43.31]I got a good one for this one.
[34:48.01]Who should I be?
[34:48.53]Let's find out.
[34:50.15]Wow.
[34:50.23]So, how did it go?
[34:52.98]It could have gone a little bit better.
[34:54.20]The alien was pretty hostile, I got to admit.
[34:57.34]But, you know, at least we're here in this great desert.
[35:01.98]There are literally no life signs on the entire planet, in case you were wondering.
[35:06.17]Oh, okay.
[35:06.79]Well, I wasn't wondering, but thanks for letting me know.
[35:10.19]well at least there's no one left to write us a bad report right sorry we can find our way back to the ship watch this one remix come on I can't be like the tourist

[35:47.27]Oh, it's protected.
[35:48.77]Come on.
[35:51.08]Why is it protected?
[35:52.22]I was going to put him all the way back there and be sprinting down screaming about how there's no oxygen on the planet.
[35:58.87]Oh, come on.
[36:01.89]Yeah, I'm holding it.
[36:15.35]Can I, how do I teleport?

[36:48.07]Where am I?
[36:50.49]I'm going to smash into something.
[36:52.30]I'm not careful.
[37:08.24]Thank God, it's light!
[37:09.54]How did it go?
[37:11.90]Hey!
[37:12.62]It's quicksand!

[38:01.87]Bad.
[38:02.77]It's quicksand.
[38:03.29]It didn't go very good.
[38:07.13]He didn't like me.
[38:08.19]Why do you not have astronaut helmet on?
[38:11.35]There's no oxygen on the planet.
[38:15.20]No!
[38:16.44]No!

[38:45.32]Put the boomer in.
[38:48.65]Hold on.
[38:49.11]I'm gonna delete this character, hold on.
[38:56.59]Alright, now we got our own scene.
[39:18.29]Let's go right here.
[39:20.17]What can I do about that?
[39:23.05]Characters.
[39:24.95]What about voices and shit?
[39:32.96]Is there a way I can change that?
[39:34.40]Let's hold on.
[39:36.12]Looks good.
[39:36.66]No, no, no.
[39:37.16]This is like more... There we go.
[39:38.98]That's better.
[39:39.70]Okay.
[39:47.39]Three o'clock.
[39:52.41]Do you know this guy?
[39:56.79]You alright?
[39:57.77]Why do you not have astronaut helmets on?
[40:00.25]Because we can breathe.
[40:00.97]There's no oxygen on the planet.
[40:05.41]You're stupid.
[40:07.03]I told you.
[40:08.13]Do you know this guy?
[40:10.89]He keeps saying, we can move around fine, man.
[40:13.43]Just call somebody.
[40:14.33]You're stupid.
[40:27.90]How do I change the voice?
[40:32.04]Jesus!
[40:34.22]Is there a way to change the voice?
[40:43.48]It auto-changes though, okay.
[40:46.52]Oh, hey Kiwa.
[40:47.70]Here we go, ready?
[40:50.02]I gotta get this right, because we have to both suck in the air at the same time.
[40:56.46]I don't know what that is.
[41:02.02]You are an idiot.
[41:03.92]I don't know that.
[41:05.67]Why do you keep asking me that?
[41:07.61]A rope.
[41:07.85]I got a rope.
[41:08.45]Hold on.
[41:08.65]Middle finger!
[41:09.99]That's what the rope...

[41:41.75]I got too into the fucking scene.
[41:43.79]Hold on.
[41:44.97]Go back.
[41:52.27]I wanted to see it so bad from this angle.
[42:00.39]I gotta learn how to do, like, cameras.
[42:01.99]Like, I think it's like this, right?
[42:06.41]So we can start here.
[42:07.23]It's 3 o'clock.
[42:12.82]Thank God, it's light!
[42:19.12]Hey!
[42:20.40]It's quicksand!

[42:31.09]Why do you not have astronaut helmets on?
[42:33.73]Because we can breathe.
[42:34.29]There's no oxygen on the planet.
[42:39.05]I hate that.
[42:39.65]I hate it so much.
[42:40.45]Stupid.
[42:41.27]I told you.
[42:42.73]You're an idiot.
[42:43.49]Do you know this guy?
[42:44.39]Quick, Sam.
[42:44.79]I don't know him.
[42:45.33]Why do you keep asking me that?
[42:46.33]He has a rope.
[42:47.31]We can put him on fire, man.
[42:48.96]I'm going in.
[42:51.62]I'll give you the oxygen with a finger.
[42:53.74]What the fuck was that?
[42:55.98]Alright, hold on.
[42:56.44]Does it?
[42:59.92]Alright, okay, okay.
[43:03.19]My hands are, like, too shaky to do this.
[43:06.35]God damn it.
[43:07.27]Hold on.
[43:07.85]My, like, hands are, like, fucking shaky as hell.
[43:13.11]Alright, hold on a second.
[43:15.13]I'm gonna put this down.
[43:19.70]Where's the... Put it down on the ground.
[43:22.76]Alright, let's sit here and watch it while I, like, shaky sniper hands.
[43:27.18]Thank God it's lightened.
[43:32.48]It's Quicksand!
[43:33.12]You know this guy?
[43:34.23]Shit!
[43:34.77]I don't ever get it.
[43:36.25]Hey!
[43:37.09]You alright?
[43:37.91]Why do you not have astronaut helmets on?
[43:39.75]Because we can breathe.
[43:41.13]There's no oxygen on the planet!
[43:43.11]Stupid.
[43:44.84]I told you!
[43:47.36]You're an idiot.
[43:48.42]Do you know this guy?
[43:49.30]Quicksand!
[43:49.70]I don't know that.
[43:50.24]Why do you keep asking me that?
[43:51.24]You have a rope.
[43:52.22]We can move around the island.
[43:53.86]I'll go over there and I'll give you the oxygen.
[43:55.73]No finger!
[44:07.15]What do I, save performance, okay.
[44:10.27]How do I do that?
[44:12.67]Now get this off.
[44:17.03]Quick share.

[56:58.12]Why is it locked?
[57:10.02]It's DLC!
[57:10.82]It might be in record mode.
[57:15.86]How do I get that off?
[57:26.75]No, it's not DLC.
[57:31.15]Weirdly enough, it thinks I'm still trying to videotape.

[57:39.55]Still doing the same thing.
[57:44.61]Nothing like over here.
[57:48.03]It's just glitched out.
[57:49.39]Let me go back to the main menu.

[59:03.59]I think I'm going to have to restart the game.
[59:12.35]Yeah, I can't even press this.
[59:18.82]Yellow dots?
[59:23.53]Clear?
[59:29.43]Nah, something's not right here.
[59:33.08]Something's not right.

[60:02.74]Woof!
[60:03.06]Oh, this is a ton of fun.
[60:17.39]I will be right back.
[60:18.06]I'm going to get this restarted and grab a glass of wine.
[63:41.43]Dude, it's like 4,000 degrees in this room already.
[63:46.53]Alright, let me get back in here.
[63:47.82]Let's hope that fixes it, because this is... I'm not going to say it yet.
[63:53.32]I'm not sure, but this could be... This could be one of the coolest VR games.
[64:02.47]Very possible.
[64:03.01]Alright, reopen it up.
[64:12.83]Mind show.
[64:14.45]Okay, let's try it again.

[64:56.48]Alright, let's go.
[65:01.62]Get me back in.
[65:05.74]Show it again.
[65:09.40]This also might be skunked.
[65:14.12]Because, okay, hold on, for all you, like, scientists, if this, if you leave a bottle of wine out for, like, six hours after opening it, and you put it back in the fridge, are you gonna die?
[65:28.21]Does that kill you?
[65:34.43]Am I gonna get tapeworm?
[65:35.95]I don't wanna get tapeworm.
[65:38.99]Am I gonna get, like, am I gonna get worms?

[66:56.60]Okay.
[67:02.66]Where's like... Assistant!
[67:05.80]To help me get in here.
[67:08.86]You need a personal assistant to get in and out of VR.
[67:12.26]That's why when they do the demos it's like three people there holding stuff for you.
[67:16.79]Alright.
[67:19.49]I'm ready.
[67:22.83]Fuck, wrong hand.

[76:26.95]Alright.
[76:48.62]Can I add another scene?
[76:54.56]Right?
[76:57.84]Can I add another one on top of this?
[76:59.52]Okay, I'm not shaking around that much.
[77:07.18]Can you enable labs mode?
[77:08.96]Labs mode.
[77:09.88]What is that?
[77:12.99]Where do I find labs mode?
[77:18.10]from the main menu, OK?
[77:19.26]Well, I'm going to save this one.
[77:22.99]Is it saved?
[77:54.40]I was gonna do every stream, every day.
[77:56.68]There you go.
[78:01.62]Alright, so.
[78:02.84]What happened?
[78:07.44]What's going on here?
[78:08.68]Did that save?
[78:11.28]What'd I do?
[78:17.51]What'd I just do?
[78:18.49]Did I just fuck it up?
[78:22.07]What the hell happened?
[78:25.85]Well, that was a big one.
[78:29.05]Alright, let's go do labs mode.
[78:30.11]You got that one.
[78:32.41]Alright, back to the main menu.
[78:38.99]Because that means I can do more characters.
[78:40.95]Labs mode.
[78:41.66]Warning, click to enable labs.
[78:50.20]Hold.
[78:50.38]Alright, we're in labs mode.
[78:56.25]Welcome to the labs.
[78:57.63]Alright, we're gonna break the game.
[79:01.90]Why is this behind me?
[79:05.18]Alright, create show.
[79:08.48]We're in labs mode now.
[79:09.46]Alright, let's do the gym.
[79:21.54]Is this gym?
[79:30.67]I can't tell what this is.
[79:32.11]No, this is not a gym.
[79:33.17]Alright, it could be.
[79:34.77]We're gonna block out over here.
[79:38.86]Shit, it's doing that thing again.
[79:46.16]No!
[79:46.66]It's doing that thing again.
[79:51.04]Is there something I can do to fix this?
[80:00.53]Or do I have to reload the game again?
[80:09.09]I don't have a character, so I don't have the options.
[80:10.81]Okay, well, let's get a character in here.
[80:13.23]I'm gonna do the gym guy.
[80:14.61]There.
[80:18.92]Yeah, see?
[80:20.56]What the hell?
[80:21.04]Come on.
[80:23.12]No!
[80:27.42]Try creating a spectator camera empty.
[80:43.26]Wacky weather report.
[80:44.20]He can't reach it.
[80:45.02]Google it.
[80:46.86]Let me Google that.
[80:54.81]Try lettuce.
[80:55.27]Check the options for more characters and time.
[81:00.93]Experimental tools.
[81:02.81]I guess we're going to put it on.
[81:04.71]Clear.
[81:06.93]Come on, give me something here.
[81:13.32]Alright, there we go.
[81:13.94]No, no, no.
[81:14.18]Ragdoll.
[81:15.50]What?
[81:20.53]Oh, that's experimental tools.
[81:28.89]No, I can't do anything on the controller.
[81:31.09]No!
[81:33.15]Damn it!
[81:42.24]Well...
[81:47.73]Turn the controllers on and off.
[81:49.25]How the fuck do I turn the controllers off?
[82:00.60]Let me switch.
[82:05.72]Settings.
[82:08.14]Controller.
[82:11.68]camera customized controller binding SteamVR no that's not it hold the button down that's what I just did this is off I mean just I'm just holding it maybe okay that one's off let's try this again come on my energy my energies are here alright they're both off I could have just pressed that couldn't I okay
[82:43.35]Now let's go back to here.
[82:44.71]Ah.
[82:49.75]God damn it.
[82:50.79]If you're playing with a starter, certain parts of the land menu will have locks over them.
[82:55.96]Plays go through each part of the starter in a specific order.
[83:00.26]So I have to do the starter stuff?
[83:03.34]But I mean, I just reloaded and came back and I could do the comedy club scene.
[83:10.07]Hold on, let me see.
[83:15.60]I have to beat the tutorial, but what is the tutorial?
[83:27.16]I mean, we kind of already did it, didn't we?
[83:35.90]Just restart the game.
[83:37.38]Well, let's just restart it.
[83:38.60]That worked last time.
[83:41.99]Alright, let me just turn, let me just hold on.
[83:45.70]Maybe I can do this.
[83:51.02]Shit!
[83:54.52]No.
[83:55.76]This is restarted.
[83:56.93]I really hope I don't have to do this every time.
[83:59.97]It'd be kind of irritating.
[84:02.61]Oh well.
[84:06.53]Let's open it again.
[84:08.30]It's when I bring out the camera.
[84:10.02]The actual recording camera is when it screws up.
[84:15.69]Unfortunately.
[84:29.09]Get rid of the camera in my hand.
[84:30.19]Yeah, but you only do that by navigating out.
[84:32.55]I can't navigate out.
[84:33.56]I can only go to teleport.
[84:37.92]The audio is ahead of the facecam.
[84:39.56]That doesn't make any sense.
[84:42.90]Shouldn't be like that.
[84:45.82]Everything's on zero.
[84:48.06]Alright, let's try this again.
[84:57.17]Okay.
[85:01.75]Why can't I open Steam?
[85:03.03]What the hell's going on?
[85:05.62]Why is my whole computer fucked up?
[85:11.78]Oh dear god, give me a break.
[85:15.89]It's the future, VR.
[85:18.93]You just need like four assistants to get it to work.
[85:22.19]It'll get there one day.
[85:22.99]Alright, let's open it back up.
[85:27.72]Let's try it again.
[85:33.92]Frustration levels are rising.
[85:42.24]Welcome to Mind Show.
[85:43.94]What?
[85:44.12]I already did this.
[85:50.66]Quickly, quickly, quickly before I cause a problem.
[85:53.60]I don't know, man.
[85:59.05]That smells like acid tastes.
[86:07.19]I'm ready.
[86:07.55]Let me play my video game.
[86:08.43]Alright, I'm going in.
[86:11.59]What did I just do?

[86:25.50]6 o'clock?
[86:27.13]Ah, thanks for watching, man.
[86:28.19]It's kind of getting late a little bit here.
[86:32.29]It's getting a little later.

[86:37.30]Alright, here we go.
[86:41.62]Give me a show.
[86:42.42]Create show.
[86:44.22]Is labs mode activated?
[86:45.96]Does that stay on?
[86:48.55]No, it's not.
[87:02.71]Fuck.
[87:07.07]Okay.
[87:10.29]I'm ready.
[87:17.44]It's the gym.
[87:20.92]We got our stuff back.
[87:24.88]Hop in.
[87:25.47]Alright, so let's delete.

[87:49.64]Okay, no, no, no.
[87:56.04]Camera?
[87:57.88]Come on, it's gotta be, like, dumbbells.

[88:08.74]Okay.
[88:18.65]Can I, I can, wait, can I glue shit together?
[88:20.33]Because I could get, okay, hold on, let me get an item.
[88:23.15]Let me get that again.
[88:24.55]And then I'm gonna glue it together.
[88:27.50]Okay.
[88:36.69]No, that's not the right thing.
[88:38.05]Actually, these are probably... What's that prop?
[88:41.11]I want that prop.
[88:42.44]Did I go buy it?
[88:43.06]I don't see it in here.

[89:16.98]Alright.
[89:18.18]So this... We're going to move this out of the way.
[89:19.92]This is just like another barbell.

[99:51.17]There's a surgery scheduled in 20 minutes.
[99:53.31]What are we supposed to do?
[99:57.34]Just call the cops.

[100:26.01]This will be a viral video.
[100:27.19]Some of these people aren't even alive.
[100:29.39]There's a skeleton in there.
[100:30.41]I get a salary nonetheless.
[100:33.07]It doesn't matter.

[102:33.33]I believe in you, bro.
[102:34.37]Yeah, that's what you need to do.
[102:37.04]You got like 3.6 on yellow.
[102:38.82]That's a start.
[102:39.36]You suck.
[102:40.72]Okay?
[102:41.22]You can do it, man.
[102:41.90]You can do it, bro.
[102:42.84]Come on, bro.
[102:43.32]Get your cell phone out and film this.
[102:44.82]This is a cool video.
[102:46.34]You can do it.
[102:46.98]Some of these people aren't even alive.
[102:48.11]That's a scary thing to do.
[102:49.39]Play this, man.
[102:50.25]I gotta put a cell phone there.
[102:54.44]I'm gonna go, okay, we need to, I gotta think about how I wanted this to be shot, because it's gonna be fucking mayhem.
[103:09.37]So, um, I think we, okay, so we start in here, because you don't know, obviously you know they're in a, let's just go as we go, right?
[103:19.48]Uh, teleport.
[103:21.96]I think start over here.
[103:23.78]Let's get the camera.
[103:30.68]Let's see how this looks.
[103:34.70]Actually, let's start here, start here.
[103:36.28]Ready?
[103:39.62]Ready?
[103:41.04]Watch this.
[103:41.52]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[103:42.50]Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[103:51.29]There's like three different scenes going on.
[103:54.58]Wait, let me back it up, back it up, back it up.
[103:56.96]There's so many things going on here.
[104:21.74]Now we're gonna get this a surgery scheduled.
[104:28.92]Come on, back it up.
[104:49.07]We're locked out of the room.
[104:50.21]We can't get in there.
[104:51.34]Bingo.
[104:51.50]Get me outside here.
[105:03.52]There's a surgery scheduled in 20 minutes.
[105:13.11]I know there's a surgery scheduled.
[105:20.08]Let's go with this.
[105:20.64]Just look out.
[105:21.18]Let's look at the scene.
[105:21.84]I scheduled him.
[105:29.47]I don't know what you're talking about.
[105:31.67]Just call the cops.
[105:33.19]You already did.
[105:47.44]This is unbelievable.
[105:48.18]You're gonna do the work.
[105:49.12]You're gonna do the work.
[105:50.20]It's all on you.
[105:51.40]Hey!
[105:52.30]Hey!
[105:52.38]Hey, you're dirtying up our stuff.
[105:53.96]You're dirtying.
[105:55.14]I know.
[105:55.56]I know.
[105:55.86]I just say it.
[105:56.52]You can do it.
[105:57.00]You can do it.
[106:00.64]You can do it.
[106:01.16]I believe in you, bro.
[106:02.04]You got like 3.6 on Yelp.
[106:02.98]I don't even know where to put the camera.
[106:16.12]Stop.
[106:16.40]Okay?
[106:17.31]You can do it, man.
[106:18.21]You can do it, bro.
[106:18.87]Come on, bro.
[106:19.47]At least get your cell phone out and film this.
[106:21.19]This is a real video.
[106:22.85]You can do it.
[106:23.27]Some of these people aren't even alive.
[106:24.71]That's a skeleton.
[106:33.33]Playlist, man.
[106:43.41]This is fucked.
[106:44.90]I can't even handle how fucking dumb this one is.
[106:46.84]Are you guys ready to watch this shit?
[106:56.13]Alright, I need to save this one.
[106:59.53]Save performance.
[107:15.37]How do I do that?
[107:16.11]Share?
[107:24.23]Wait, did I do it?
[107:28.72]That's it, right?
[107:29.24]Did I do it?
[107:36.86]Yellow dots is save.
[107:40.08]Well, it said save performance, right?
[107:43.60]Let me see if this works.
[107:46.52]Where's the camera?
[107:52.44]Did I just lose everything?
[107:56.34]Why would it do that?
[108:01.59]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[108:09.73]I did save performance.
[108:11.11]I clicked on it, and then it didn't do anything.
[108:12.95]Did that actually work?
[108:22.05]How did I... I mean, I did all that work, and then I said save performance, and it just X'd out of the screen.
[108:28.77]Save.
[108:29.07]Yeah, I know, but like... Is this gonna save the camera shit?
[108:33.11]I hope so.
[108:41.68]It will not.
[108:46.81]Wait, what?
[108:47.35]Hold on, let me see.
[108:58.28]I'm so confused at how that works.
[109:00.10]Because I did everything and on the top left it said save performance and I clicked it and then everything went, it just like cleared it.
[109:12.71]Can I watch that now?
[109:27.25]Cause now, like, I can't... Where's my, my... Hold trigger to record.
[109:35.15]That's like what I did.
[109:35.91]That's kind of an odd menu system.
[109:43.89]Cause now... I misclicked when trying to save.
[109:56.08]What?
[110:04.67]The recording thing is still red.
[110:08.49]So how do I like watch it from here?
[110:11.69]There's no real clear indication of like how, like, alright.
[110:14.25]So when I like record like this, where, where's it go?
[110:23.56]Is that it?
[110:24.04]I'm just gonna go to the menu and just see what happens.
[110:39.94]uh I'm just gonna go back it's confusing sharing to stream saving the performance overwrites the camera data why the hell would that happen
[111:12.75]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[111:31.03]I'm so confused.
[111:32.45]What the fuck is happening?
[111:34.75]Hey!
[111:34.99]Hey!
[111:36.07]Hey, you dirty, you are!
[111:37.32]Stop!
[111:37.80]It's dirty.
[111:38.24]You can do it.
[111:39.00]You can do it.
[111:39.98]You can do it.
[111:40.62]I believe you.
[111:41.96]You got like 3.6 on you.
[111:43.38]I think it's just doing it.
[111:44.24]What the fuck is happening?
[111:45.08]At least get your cell phone out and film this.
[111:48.20]No, it's working.
[111:48.74]Some of these people aren't even alive.
[111:51.53]That's a skeleton.
[111:52.23]Play this, man.
[112:01.56]Am I gonna be in the scene?
[112:02.70]Does that do it?
[112:03.70]What the hell is going on here?
[112:05.08]What the fuck?
[112:05.44]Da-
[112:33.68]Does anybody have any idea what the fuck is happening?
[112:39.08]It just went, it's going crazy and now it's like doing the thing.
[112:47.21]It was rendering, was it though?
[112:48.71]I feel like that's the beginning.
[113:00.03]Did I have two conflicting takes?
[113:01.75]No, I don't think so.
[113:18.55]I mean, it's exporting, but it's exporting, like, incorrectly.
[113:26.97]So if I, like, even... If I even touch right trigger at all, it deletes the whole thing.
[113:32.86]You'd think there'd be, like, a confirmation there or something.
[113:36.18]Like, oh, you sure you want to, like, delete all the camera shit you just did?
[113:41.04]I don't think I did that.
[113:50.11]That's the multiple takes at the beginning.
[113:52.40]Oh, okay.
[113:53.46]How do I get out of here?
[113:56.16]How do I get out of here?
[114:01.02]What?
[114:19.66]Did I beat the game?
[114:21.58]Uh, this is all fucked up.
[114:29.54]Uh... Okay, I'm back.
[114:32.74]View... Viewer position... What the fuck is happening?
[114:39.07]So, I have to do that again.
[114:47.90]So this is the very beginning.
[114:49.22]God damn it.
[114:49.74]Alright.
[114:51.68]Fuck!
[114:52.54]That was done!
[114:53.16]Alright, so let's do it again.
[115:03.91]What a pain in the ass.
[115:18.69]We can't get in.
[115:20.17]I'll make it quick.
[115:33.80]There's a surgery scheduled in 20 minutes.
[115:36.34]I know there's a surgery scheduled.
[115:38.44]I scheduled it.
[115:44.59]No, back up here, back up here.
[115:53.58]I already did.
[115:55.90]Alright, slowly but surely.
[116:09.09]This is unbelievable.
[116:10.43]I know.
[116:10.79]Hey!
[116:10.91]Hey!
[116:11.09]Hey, you're dirtying up our stuff!
[116:12.47]No, you're dirtying.
[116:14.13]You're dirtying, I know.
[116:15.11]I know how to say it.
[116:15.99]You're dirtying.
[116:29.96]You can do it!
[116:31.42]You can do it!
[116:34.05]You got like 3.6 on Yelp as a search.
[116:36.35]You can do it, man.
[116:44.40]You can do it, bro.
[116:45.42]Come on, bro.
[116:46.02]At least get your cell phone out and film this.
[116:47.86]You can do it.
[116:48.54]Some of these people aren't even alive.
[116:51.12]That's a scam.
[117:01.30]Alright, okay, alright
[117:31.81]Nobody move.
[117:34.43]Nobody move.
[117:44.93]I got it.
[117:46.55]So now it's ready.
[117:50.18]I didn't need to do this.
[117:53.08]It's already saved.
[117:55.32]Well, but what about the camera like freaking out all over the place?
[117:57.38]Because I did like the multiple takes, right?
[118:01.90]I didn't need to redo it?
[118:04.38]Oh, it already did it.
[118:05.42]Oh, what the fuck?
[118:07.42]Alright, let's watch the damn thing.
[118:08.78]You ready?
[118:17.54]No!
[118:17.72]No, play it.
[118:49.30]I just, right, it needs to render?
[118:51.96]Alright, but like, so what now, save performance from here?
[119:01.90]Look at my computer.
[119:06.47]What about it?
[119:07.89]What are you talking about?
[119:15.21]Labs is the culprit.
[119:17.95]So you're telling me if I click on save performance, or if I click on more and I do save, yeah, okay, I know it saves it in documents folder, but, so if I go to export right now, the files are on, yeah, but like how do I know it's even saving what I just did?
[119:46.83]Alright, hold on.
[119:53.51]Documents mine show videos.
[119:55.33]Okay.
[119:55.65]What the fuck?
[120:08.98]I see it, but is it... Nah, it's all fucked up.
[120:13.20]Alright, so...
[120:15.54]It's the camera's all fucked up.
[120:16.94]It's all shaking around like crazy.
[120:18.34]I don't know why it's doing this.
[120:21.62]Holy shit.
[120:24.52]It's so fucked up.
[120:30.38]What the fuck?
[120:35.32]Alright, I'm going to export this one and see what happens.
[120:42.27]Yeah, this video is all fucked up.
[120:46.38]It's the same... I'll show you the curse after.
[120:52.35]I'm gonna try to save this one.
[120:53.55]So, alright, let me get this straight.
[120:54.73]Save, performance, export video, right?
[121:05.84]My God.
[121:06.62]This shouldn't be this complicated.
[121:12.78]Save performance.
[121:16.62]What?
[121:17.04]Alright, the... Export... Where is it?
[121:24.64]What?
[121:26.84]You see what I'm talking about?
[121:29.88]What happened to it?
[121:37.54]Share?
[121:37.96]60 FPS?
[121:52.02]I can't hear this anymore.
[121:53.36]You just dropped it away, Finn.
[121:55.60]It's a surgery scheduled in 20 minutes.
[121:57.62]I know.
[121:58.04]It's a surgery scheduled.
[121:59.73]I scheduled it.
[122:00.47]I am a pretty intelligent.
[122:02.35]Call the cops.
[122:03.49]I already did.
[122:04.11]This is unbelievable.
[122:07.35]I think this is working.
[122:08.31]Hey!
[122:08.43]Hey!
[122:11.47]Alright, if you've got a save performance button in the top left, you've got to go right to another menu after that.
[122:20.10]Because otherwise you can just fuck it all up.
[122:23.68]I thought like save performance, save it, save.
[122:39.41]But it's not like the video, they're two separate entities.
[122:41.83]Okay, alright.
[122:42.17]It's time to watch that video.
[122:43.87]Oh, thank god, it's finally done.
[123:09.11]Time for the next scene.
[123:10.21]Well, there was no tutorial on that one.
[123:18.56]I had to just guess.
[123:31.01]We're not gonna watch this one.
[123:32.19]We've seen this one so many times.
[123:33.93]I don't wanna hear the wait thing.
[123:36.01]We'll watch them all at the end.
[123:44.76]Oh, they see the skeleton in there.
[123:46.06]You see the skeleton?
[123:46.98]I don't want to get in that fucking line anymore.
[123:52.74]Alright.
[124:02.23]Now I know how to save and export performances.
[124:05.71]I figured it out.
[124:11.06]Some of these people aren't even alive.
[124:13.14]That's a skeleton in there.
[124:22.04]Yeah, I'm going to put all these... I'll do a compilation at the end of the stream.
[124:29.41]3.4 on Yelp.
[124:31.75]Alright, next scene.
[124:33.09]Give me an object.
[124:33.95]Give me a place.
[124:34.53]Oh, no, no.
[124:35.19]I'm going to do the clip thing.
[124:36.33]Right.
[124:36.55]Let's see if I can recreate the clip.
[124:50.44]I do have to do a fight scene, too.
[125:00.47]Acknowledge the pleas for rat movie?
[125:02.11]I can't do all... I can't do the whole rat movie, guys.
[125:09.35]That's like fucking seven minutes.
[125:11.98]I'm lucky to get one scene done with 30 seconds.
[125:14.68]Minute long.
[125:21.64]That was like a painful procedure.
[125:31.56]Give me a scene.
[125:32.51]Give me an object.
[125:33.37]Give me a thing.
[125:33.97]Give me a person.
[125:34.53]Give me a place.
[125:35.11]Give me a thing.
[125:35.59]Give me a noun.
[125:36.23]Give me a verb.
[125:36.75]Give me an adjective.
[125:37.39]Give me an adverb.
[125:38.11]Give me a conjunctivitis.
[125:47.55]Horse.
[125:47.87]Okay, I can't do that.
[125:48.65]Sorry.
[125:48.87]Believe me.
[125:49.49]I'm going to wait for this to be done.
[126:13.73]Go!
[126:21.26]Hey!
[126:27.66]We're back!
[126:43.60]I want to see this.
[126:44.36]Get me out of here quick.
[126:46.39]New scene.
[126:47.05]Clear it.
[126:57.25]Oh, shit.
[126:58.55]Oh, god damn it.
[126:59.71]No, that's fine.
[127:00.31]Just in case something goes wrong.
[127:04.45]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[127:06.45]Okay.
[127:09.51]Alright, clear it.
[127:11.26]New place.
[127:11.72]We need a...
[127:31.37]hello hello and welcome to another episode hello and welcome hello and welcome hello
[128:15.19]Fear.
[128:16.82]Death.
[128:18.36]Okay.
[128:22.77]This one's going to be experimental.
[128:24.77]We're going with experimental poetry.
[128:33.36]I'm not even doing that.
[128:34.64]Do you see what's happening here?
[128:36.00]I'm not doing that.
[128:36.72]I'm not doing that.
[128:39.94]Stop it.
[128:51.01]My father was fairly wealthy.
[128:53.63]He would sometimes come home and shower us with gifts.
[128:57.65]Various toys, trinkets, and the like.
[129:02.13]But my father also brought something else into the house.
[129:05.43]Animals.
[129:08.19]Lots of animals.
[129:11.15]See, he was a zoologist by trade, and besides the money, which was great, we had an entire zoo in our backyard.
[129:20.21]Although through the years,
[129:22.32]One would say that sharing a bed with a giraffe is not so great after a while.
[129:34.93]We grow distant, him and I. The last time I spoke with him was July of 2006.
[129:43.22]And here's why.
[129:47.06]He killed my mother!
[129:47.86]I don't know.
[129:48.68]I don't know.
[129:49.16]That was not enough time.
[129:55.78]My father was fairly wealthy.
[129:58.44]He would send out his own children and kids, various toys, crickets, and the like.
[130:07.03]But my father also brought something else into the house.
[130:12.63]Animals.
[130:12.83]This sucks!
[130:15.97]So he was a zoologist by trade.
[130:18.85]And besides the money, which was great, we had an entire zoo in our backyard.
[130:25.09]All through the years, one would say that sharing a bed with a giraffe is not so great.
[130:39.74]We grow distant, him and I. The last time I saw him was July of 2006.
[130:49.91]And here's why.
[130:51.85]He killed my mother!
[130:52.65]I don't know why.
[130:55.21]Are you ready?
[131:07.07]My father was fairly wealthy.
[131:09.43]He would sometimes come home and shower us with gifts.
[131:21.03]Various toys, crickets, and the like.
[131:34.49]My father also brought something else into the house.
[131:37.47]Animals.
[131:40.43]Lots of animals.
[131:43.37]So he was a zoologist by trade.
[131:57.34]And besides the money, which was great, we had an entire zoo in our backyard.
[132:03.49]Although through the years, one would say that sharing a bed... Ow!
[132:18.10]When the giraffe... is not so grand.
[132:27.50]After a love.
[132:29.88]We grow distant.
[132:32.24]In the night.
[132:34.62]The last time I spoke with him was July of 2006.
[132:47.25]And here's why.
[132:53.25]Kill my mother!
[132:58.58]This one sucks.
[133:12.46]My father was fairly wealthy.
[133:15.12]He would sometimes come home and shower us with gifts.
[133:19.14]Various toys, crickets, and the like.
[133:23.60]But my father also brought something else into the house.
[133:25.84]D-sync.
[133:26.24]Animals.
[133:28.86]My father was very wealthy.
[133:31.16]He had a bag of money.
[133:32.80]He was a zoologist by trade.
[133:34.80]Now I'm going to choreograph a fight.
[133:36.10]We had an entire zoo in our backyard.
[133:41.71]I look through the years, one would say that sharing a bed... I'm trying to think of an animal.
[133:49.11]I was so desperately thinking of an animal.
[133:52.51]It's not so great.
[133:53.67]You can feel the cogs turning there.
[133:56.41]We grow distant, him and I. The last time I spoke to him was July of 2006.
[134:04.58]And here's why.
[134:08.52]He killed my mother!
[134:09.42]I...
[134:19.78]Hey, make sure to scream at the end.
[134:21.80]Look at this camera work.
[134:28.94]You don't think I know what I'm doing?
[134:33.73]You don't think I didn't go to school for this shit?
[134:41.78]mods please what's going on don't turn that into a coffee pasta Jesus Christ don't July what various toys trinkets that was just alright so you know
[135:08.36]When words just come out but they mean abso-fucking-lutely nothing.
[135:12.95]Words were just coming out of my mouth and they meant nothing.
[135:17.95]It was just word soup.
[135:19.52]It didn't mean anything.
[135:20.50]It wasn't going anywhere.
[135:21.54]It was just a run-on sentence.
[135:44.55]Fix the audio desync, I don't even know what, hold on, what are you talking about?
[135:50.60]What are you, hold on, hold on, ready?
[135:51.72]Like, up, up, up, up, up.
[135:55.72]It should be, that's not synced?
[136:01.53]It's the game audio, that shouldn't be a thing.
[136:06.39]The video has desync.
[136:07.83]Alright, but how, by how much?
[136:16.87]Let's do a test.
[136:18.24]I wanna see.
[136:21.62]It's three seconds.
[136:22.80]What the fuck are you talking about?
[136:24.46]What?
[136:26.16]What?
[136:29.22]It's three seconds of desync?
[136:31.26]No way.
[136:33.70]You gotta be kidding me.
[136:34.58]What the fuck are you?
[136:35.54]What?
[136:35.78]Are you serious?
[136:38.04]Why?
[136:39.04]That doesn't make any sense.
[136:41.98]How does that make any sense?
[136:44.21]Alright, hold on a minute.
[136:45.01]I gotta do some testing here.
[136:48.20]That makes no sense.
[136:52.97]That makes no sense.
[136:53.87]That makes no sense.
[136:56.93]Save it.
[136:57.29]Save this.
[137:01.82]Alright, you ready?
[137:04.08]Click, click, click.
[137:07.88]Are you hearing that when I click it?
[137:17.17]It's delayed?
[137:17.89]Alright, but by how much?
[137:20.47]So, are you hearing the... It's actually bad.
[137:29.11]I'm surprised.
[137:32.87]No, it is not five seconds.
[137:34.53]Click comes way later in the video.
[137:36.69]That's fucking strange.
[137:39.41]That's strange.
[137:40.37]Alright, hold on a second here.
[137:45.63]So it comes way later.
[137:49.73]It's like two seconds?
[137:52.78]What the fuck?
[137:56.40]It's actually a couple seconds.
[137:57.46]That makes no sense.
[137:59.24]Because on my... It's to do with the game.
[138:06.89]Yeah, that's weird.
[138:07.49]Because on my screen it looks fine.
[138:09.67]Let me see if I can delay this.
[138:11.63]So... Tell me if this changes anything.
[138:20.11]I'm sorry, guys.
[138:20.69]That's really weird.
[138:26.69]Tell me if this changes anything.
[138:29.75]Ready?
[138:31.31]Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[138:42.62]Now it's worse.
[138:45.12]Hold on a sec.
[138:54.04]Let me try this.
[138:54.62]I'm going to try something here.
[138:59.28]Tell me if this changes anything.
[139:10.67]I'm going to add a filter on it and see if I can just make it.
[139:15.43]That's annoying.
[139:16.25]Damn.
[139:20.64]wait wait wait restart the game and it'll be fixed it's a known issue oh are you kidding me okay okay alright but I'm gonna restart we'll try it again I saved that one so that one's ready to watch later let me make sure these are actually coming out okay because this would be a disaster if later on I put a giant like eight minute compilation and they all suck they all don't do anything
[139:54.40]No, that's good.
[139:54.84]Well, they work.
[139:55.40]We'll just put it that way.
[139:59.45]Alright, we're good.
[140:02.05]I'm going to restart the game, apparently.
[140:26.66]Jerma is upset no I just want to make sure it's not there's not like a huge delay you know that'd be like kind of hard to watch uh great canadian club five community subs thanks a lot great canadian thank you for the five I've not been paying much attention to bit I really can't stream labs is turned off for VR as you're aware let's reopen it and see if it fixes it
[141:03.12]Get in there.
[141:04.62]Get in there!
[141:05.04]Okay.
[141:11.88]You tell me.
[141:12.36]Hey, thanks.
[141:23.48]Okay, ready?
[141:24.06]You tell me.
[141:34.62]You should be hearing like... What happened to my chat?
[141:46.97]Oh.
[141:57.17]It's... I have no idea why the fuck that's happening.
[142:09.00]It's the game audio that's delayed.
[142:12.54]I wonder if I should just delay all the audio then.
[142:20.14]Let me see what it sounds like.
[142:24.21]That's really odd.
[142:27.99]Ready?
[142:29.97]Quick, quick, quick.
[142:32.25]What the fuck?
[142:33.73]Quick.
[142:35.81]Alright, you ready?
[142:37.58]You ready?
[142:54.43]I have no words for why that's happening.
[142:56.09]Hold on, let me try something.
[143:04.78]That's like a six second fucking delay.
[143:09.88]Alright, hold on, ready?
[143:12.58]Can I delay this?
[143:18.36]Yeah, I'm gonna delay the video and mix the audio.
[143:22.59]Jesus.
[143:25.94]Why can't I add a filter on here?
[143:33.64]I need to delay.
[143:39.56]So if you're hearing it like, let me see if this works.
[143:46.50]Tell me how this works.
[143:47.24]Ready?
[143:50.27]I'm sorry, this is an issue I've never run into before.
[143:53.91]Alright, ready?
[143:54.33]So if it's like, let's just say it's like this.
[144:01.05]And put the mic delayed to.
[144:09.42]So now, you tell me if this change, that it's gonna be delayed to be even worse.
[144:19.04]Because now my motions will be delayed, but the audio won't.
[144:22.48]Ready?
[144:23.44]One, two, three.
[144:25.76]One.
[144:32.91]Nah, it's even worse now.
[144:47.17]Restarting SteamVR.
[144:48.67]Yeah, maybe I'll try that.
[145:02.49]This just started happening after you recorded the ghost character.
[145:05.43]Okay.
[145:06.38]So.
[145:08.74]Let me try a couple things.
[145:11.42]I apologize, everybody.
[145:14.58]Give me like a couple minutes.
[145:15.68]I'm going to be right back.
[145:17.54]Let me try to get this fixed.
[145:19.38]I'm going to restart SteamVR.
[145:23.08]And, I mean, of course.
[145:25.08]Get another one of these.
[145:36.63]Fuck.
[145:37.91]Well, this is going to be a technical troubleshooting stream.
[145:44.27]God damn it.
[145:47.13]Alright, I'll be right back.
[145:49.27]See if I can get this fixed.
[150:36.68]Alright, come on.
[150:39.24]Don't do it to me.
[150:41.24]Don't do this to me.
[150:43.74]I've got so much going on right now in the VR.
[150:49.59]Fuck.
[150:51.37]I'm trying.
[150:54.45]I'm trying.
[150:56.75]The effort is here.
[151:01.43]Come on, work.
[151:04.29]Let's get back on camera so we can test it again.
[151:10.94]Yeah, um, I really don't know what to do with my hair.
[151:14.54]I was thinking maybe let it grow out a little, and then maybe you can trim it and change it a little?
[151:21.56]Uh, sir, sir, this isn't human hair.
[151:26.59]Oh, I know.
[151:27.81]I took a little bit of uncooked spaghetti and put it on here.
[151:31.75]Can you still do something with it?
[151:32.69]Can you still work with it?
[151:35.79]That's an old joke.
[151:36.51]He said that before.
[151:39.36]Welcome to Mindshow.
[151:40.40]Shaved your beard?
[151:43.40]No.
[151:44.56]I'm gonna grow it until it's on the fucking floor.
[151:49.98]That was an old joke, it was.
[151:50.96]I know.
[151:51.38]Who cares?
[151:52.38]This is just what happens.
[151:56.02]My appearance is at the bottom of the ladder right now.
[151:58.19]Stream functioning is up here.
[152:00.31]Appearance?
[152:01.03]Who cares?
[152:01.47]I don't want this delay to be a fucking thing.
[152:07.45]Pubic hair.
[152:10.77]Nah, I was going to give you the finger.
[152:12.05]I was thinking about it.
[152:15.33]Oh, I was thinking it was about to come up.
[152:16.93]See, I'm trying to keep... Just don't do that.
[152:19.75]Okay, we're fine.
[152:20.29]You guys are going to have to help me.
[152:29.53]Let's see if I can test it.
[152:37.08]Alright.
[152:38.58]You tell me.
[152:40.76]Are we fixed?
[152:43.30]Ready?
[152:46.24]Click, click, click.
[152:48.52]Click, click, click.
[152:57.35]No?
[153:05.23]What happened?
[153:09.09]What the fuck happened?
[153:12.92]I don't understand what happened.
[153:14.20]You're telling me this started after I went into the ghost thing?
[153:18.75]I restarted SteamVR.
[153:22.49]It's even lighter now.
[153:26.87]Shit.
[153:33.07]I'm gonna try one more thing and we're just gonna move on.
[153:35.01]We're gonna go.
[153:36.13]I got to.
[153:36.59]I can't just fucking do this all day, you know guys?
[153:38.57]Sorry.
[153:43.24]I can't just, like, do this all fucking day.
[153:46.28]God damn it.
[153:47.16]Let me try one more thing.
[153:53.06]Hold on.
[153:55.42]Shit.
[153:57.42]Delay all the other audio, and... Yeah, but I tried that before, and it just... You can't queue it up.
[154:05.35]Validate the game files for Mindshow.
[154:09.07]I was having a lot of fun, too.
[154:10.17]God damn it.
[154:10.75]I don't know what's going on.
[154:15.43]Let me reboot again.
[154:16.35]That was going somewhere, too.
[154:21.58]It really was.
[154:22.06]Let's reboot VR again.
[154:32.29]There it goes.
[154:34.31]Let's see what happens.
[154:43.57]I have to kill the chat too, so sorry guys.
[154:46.49]I won't be able to see what you're saying for testing purposes.
[154:56.19]Okay, let's try again.
[154:59.68]Last attempt before I have to kind of... I guess just have to deal with it, maybe.
[155:05.28]You ready?
[155:17.04]Is this fixed?
[155:23.83]We good?
[155:28.25]Yeah?
[155:29.27]It's fixed?
[155:33.15]Yeah!
[155:33.48]Are you sure?
[155:40.92]Hey!
[155:41.58]Would you like a piece of pie?
[155:45.24]Good.
[155:46.74]I don't fuck.
[155:47.16]What the hell was that?
[155:48.03]I've been doing this for almost 10 years, right?
[155:52.47]And sometimes, like, shit just don't make no sense.
[155:54.99]It doesn't matter how much you try to get ready for something to prepare.
[155:57.49]That shit makes no sense.
[155:59.36]What happened?
[156:01.12]I don't understand.
[156:03.66]Fucking computers.
[156:04.82]Don't ever buy one.
[156:06.46]Just read a newspaper.
[156:07.26]Do the crosswords.
[156:07.94]Don't buy a... Uh-oh.
[156:09.35]I'm shutting off.
[156:10.27]What?
[156:11.55]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[156:12.53]What?
[156:12.67]What's going on?
[156:15.70]I didn't do anything.
[156:17.56]I was playing the game on my computer.
[156:19.73]Just only do crosswords.
[156:20.83]Don't ever fucking buy a computer.
[156:23.71]Jerma, do you have any specs I should buy?
[156:25.65]Yeah, it's called a fucking book.
[156:28.43]Go read Lord of the Rings.
[156:30.47]Don't buy a computer.
[156:32.91]Alright, I'm ready.
[156:34.65]I can't do OVR Drop right now.
[156:38.20]I can't do the chat here yet.
[156:40.22]We gotta move on.
[156:41.06]I gotta make something and we'll go back to it.
[156:44.06]I'm sorry, guys.
[156:45.28]I can't see the chat anymore.
[156:46.54]Maybe that was the problem.
[156:49.49]That might have been fucked up.
[156:50.37]I don't know.
[156:50.71]Because I didn't have it on here.
[156:54.33]Fuck!
[156:57.63]What a disaster.
[156:58.25]It's been like fucking 30 minutes.
[157:00.80]Thank you for sticking around.
[157:04.12]There was like 4,400, 4,300.
[157:05.10]There's still like 4,000 people here almost.
[157:08.36]Thanks.
[157:10.00]Glad you could sit through this fucking nonsense.
[157:11.80]Thank you.
[157:12.85]Let's go.
[157:17.55]I'm ready.
[157:24.73]That wine is so gross.
[157:30.02]I mean, it just smells the way that tastes.
[157:36.34]You know what I mean?
[157:36.98]Like, what the?
[157:40.40]I'm ready.
[157:42.69]I can't see you guys' reactions.
[157:44.03]I don't like this.
[157:47.53]I need, like, reactions, man.
[157:48.91]I'm a reaction streamer.
[157:52.39]Dude, can you fucking believe what that thing is?
[157:54.43]What the fuck?
[157:55.17]I got shit in my eye.
[157:56.05]God, no.
[157:56.88]I don't care.
[157:57.78]Deal with the pain.
[157:58.96]I got stuff in my eye.
[158:00.66]I have charcoal in my eye.
[158:01.96]I'm ready.
[158:02.44]Create show.
[158:04.76]I can't.
[158:05.64]I can't.
[158:08.06]Where are you?
[158:10.00]I can't see anybody.
[158:11.04]You ready for this one?
[158:19.21]I got it.
[158:21.11]Oh, I got it.
[158:23.44]Check this shit out.
[158:24.66]What?
[158:53.86]Lab mode's not on, don't worry.
[159:04.56]Okay.
[159:05.84]So who has the mythic key to do this?
[159:08.30]We're a mythic plus eight.
[159:10.12]So, I mean, you gotta be ready to go.
[159:15.06]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[159:16.02]You see, I'm the guild leader, so I determine when we open the door.
[159:21.19]You're the key holder.
[159:22.57]That's what it says on your resume.
[159:24.43]On my resume, it's Guild Leader.
[159:27.49]This is gonna be tough.
[159:29.72]Shut up.
[159:30.02]You don't matter.
[159:31.14]You don't matter, okay?
[159:46.25]I love World of Warcraft.
[159:50.56]Oh, I do!
[159:51.10]I do!
[159:51.30]I got the key!
[159:51.76]Plus eight.
[159:52.48]Yeah, it's a mythic plus eight.
[159:53.58]You gotta be ready to go.
[159:55.02]I'm ready.
[159:55.44]I'm ready.
[159:55.72]I've been ready since there's X-Men running trying to meet into the guild.
[159:57.91]No, no, no, no, no.
[159:58.87]You see, I'm the guild leader.
[160:00.55]Yeah, I know.
[160:01.11]So I determine when we open the door.
[160:02.69]But can I open the door?
[160:03.91]You're the key holder.
[160:05.37]I am the key holder.
[160:05.99]This is on your resume.
[160:07.29]On my resume, it's guild leader.
[160:09.73]But we're co-guild leaders.
[160:12.88]You don't matter.
[160:13.72]Yes, he does.
[160:14.62]Yes, he does!
[160:24.33]Guys, I gotta go.
[160:25.15]My baby's gonna be born in 45 minutes.
[160:28.41]I've gotta get out of here.
[160:29.41]Just open the fucking door.
[160:30.97]My baby's gonna be born in 45 minutes.
[160:32.96]Are you listening to me?
[160:33.84]It's fucking raw.

[165:08.30]I mean, you're mentioning winds, but you're not mentioning the fact that Las Vegas is going to be wiped out by the meteor.
[165:13.57]And I bumped my hand on the table.

[190:10.80]Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[190:15.50]Amen.
[190:25.30]Well, I got an A-minus in my math class.
[190:30.39]And the teacher told me to come after school to run the national play.
[190:36.01]So I've been doing very well.
[190:38.13]A-plus.
[190:39.09]Mm-hmm.
[190:40.35]Right.
[190:42.37]Exactly.
[191:05.64]Blessed our Lord for these side gifts that we are about to receive.
[191:09.40]From thy bounty, through Christ our Lord, amen.
[191:12.88]Give us this day our daily bread, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and we forgive those who trespass against us.
[191:20.51]Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[191:22.45]Amen.
[191:22.59]Amen.
[191:32.57]Oh, me.
[191:33.36]Oh, me.
[191:34.50]I have news.
[191:35.32]I have news.
[191:37.76]Well, I got an A-minus in my math class.
[191:42.85]And the teacher told me to come after school to run the national play.
[191:48.47]So I've been doing very good.
[191:49.71]But I, I...
[191:52.74]I went to a field trip today, and the teacher called on me and said that I had the best answer out of all of them.
[191:59.05]I talked about how the cows get milked three times a day, and Johnny said two.
[192:13.51]Blessed are thou for these high gifts that we are about to receive from thy bounty.
[192:19.70]From thy bounty.
[192:20.44]Christ our Lord, amen.
[192:21.64]Christ our Lord, amen.
[192:24.06]Give this day our daily bread.
[192:25.30]And we forgive those who trespass against us.
[192:27.20]And we forgive those who trespass against us.
[192:29.68]And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[192:32.24]Amen.
[192:32.40]Amen.
[192:32.62]Amen.
[192:43.58]Me!
[192:43.74]Me!
[192:43.86]Me!
[192:43.96]Me!
[192:44.30]Ah!

[193:21.04]Say your goddamn prayer.
[193:22.76]Bless it.
[193:23.06]Bless it all.
[193:37.06]Got it!
[193:40.38]Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[193:44.28]Oh, they got it!
[193:45.72]Nice job, kids.
[193:46.74]So who wants to tell me about their day?
[193:49.00]Who wants to tell me what they did today?
[193:52.10]Tim, Jenny?
[193:54.16]You.
[193:54.74]You.
[193:55.06]You get to speak.
[193:56.58]A minus in my math class.
[193:59.92]And the teacher told me to come after school to run the national play.
[194:04.96]Good.
[194:05.82]Good.
[194:06.06]You, go!
[194:08.52]But I, I...
[194:11.53]I went to a field trip today, and the teacher called on me and said that I have- That's my boy!
[194:17.85]I talked about how the cows get milked- What did you do?
[194:22.31]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[194:25.91]Say your God-damned prayers.
[194:27.61]Blessed our Lord, I will release thy gifts that we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord and King.
[194:35.80]Give us this day our daily bread, as we forgive those that trespass against us, and we forgive those that trespass against us.
[194:43.93]Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[194:48.65]Oh, they got it.
[194:51.02]Nice job, kids.
[194:52.34]So who wants to tell me about their day?
[194:54.28]Who wants to tell me what they did today?
[194:56.58]Me.
[194:57.24]I do, sir.
[194:58.42]Kelly?
[194:59.46]You.
[194:59.80]You.
[195:00.04]You get to speak.
[195:03.49]And the teacher told me to come after school to run the national play.
[195:08.83]I've been doing very well.
[195:10.25]Good.
[195:11.11]Good.
[195:11.37]You, go.
[195:12.19]I, I...
[195:15.13]I went to a field trip today.
[195:17.63]The teacher called on me and said that I had the best answer of all of them.
[195:21.43]I don't know how the cows get milked.
[195:23.37]Can I have somebody play the piano?
[195:24.83]Never mind.
[195:43.35]It's a huge desync again.
[195:44.97]I'm going to render this and we'll try it again.
[196:11.15]I restarted SteamVR before.
[196:16.39]Let me render this.
[196:17.32]Let me get the right camera angles that I want.
[196:21.62]It's hard to really make a full thing in a minute.
[196:25.02]You know what I mean?
[196:26.44]There's a lot I want to condense.
[196:27.96]What I'm going to have to do, so the next thing I'm going to do is one minute per scene, and we're going to have to watch them all back to back.
[196:35.40]Can I extend that timer?
[196:37.12]I feel like I could do way more.
[196:39.85]Alright, so let's get the camera here.
[196:42.96]Okay, let's open this up here.
[196:44.65]Right here.
[196:52.17]Say your goddamn prayers.
[196:53.89]Bless it, O Lord.
[196:54.53]Bless it, O Lord.
[197:03.35]Bless it, O Lord.
[197:16.34]Let me get over here.
[197:48.51]Got it!
[197:49.43]Nice job, kids!
[197:50.41]So who wants to tell me about their date?
[197:52.67]Who wants to tell me what they did today?
[198:03.04]Ah!
[198:06.06]You!
[198:08.28]You get to speak.
[198:13.84]Fuck.
[198:14.12]I'm bumping into some shit.
[198:20.45]And the teacher told me to come after school to run the national play I
[198:47.96]I went to a field trip today, and the teacher called on me and said that I had the best answer out of all of them.
[198:54.27]I don't know how the cows get milked.
[198:55.93]Okay.
[199:02.79]That's it?
[199:04.39]What?
[199:04.65]What?
[199:06.25]I don't have any more time.
[199:08.88]Oh, fuck.
[199:11.86]Alright, I need a part two.
[199:14.58]Ugh.
[199:26.22]Say your goddamn words.
[199:28.01]Bless it. Bless it. Bless it. Bless it. Bless it. Bless it.
[199:49.05]Oh, they got it.
[199:51.35]Nice job, kids.
[199:52.67]So who wants to tell me about their day?
[199:54.61]Who wants to tell me what they did today?
[199:55.83]Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me.
[200:15.50]I went to a field trip today, and the teacher called on me and said that I had the best answer out of all of them.
[200:21.54]That's my boy.
[200:22.08]About how the cows get milked.
[200:23.80]Alright, what did you do was the last thing.
[200:26.57]We've got to wait for that to render.
[200:33.61]What did you do?
[200:34.33]Now it's time for her to speak.
[200:40.69]It desyncs whenever I, yeah, export a video.
[200:45.47]well let me get this done that's so sad so every single time I export a video the desync gets exponentially worse just stop exporting videos apparently oh well still fun can I export all of them at the end I don't think so
[201:13.01]What's this called?
[201:13.57]Mind Show Untitled 3.
[201:25.90]So I gotta get one more one minute.
[201:28.96]We're gonna get the Broccoli's answer.
[201:32.09]And we'll go on from there.
[201:37.25]I'm not sure if saving them and then doing it off stream is a good idea.
[201:41.41]Because it seems like...
[201:46.24]It seems like you only get this one instance of the scene.
[201:53.44]Am I correct on that?
[201:59.70]Just watch, yeah, that's true.
[202:02.46]I could just watch it, but we had a problem with that before too.
[202:04.76]Remember I tried to play the last one and it just wouldn't play, it was skipping all over the place?
[202:14.17]Alright, we're gonna do part two.
[202:15.95]I'm gonna finish this up.
[202:18.87]Dad's gonna see how fast they can eat.
[202:21.83]And that determines who the favorite child is.
[202:33.63]Is it storming?
[202:35.42]That's in the game.
[202:36.68]That's not outside here.
[202:39.06]No, it's not storming.
[202:51.67]Yeah, where's the jazz?
[202:54.38]This feels really out of place.
[202:55.50]Alright.
[203:40.59]The next thing I'm going to do is singing.
[203:43.26]I'm going to try to sing with like six or seven people.
[203:47.28]Any particular songs that you'd like to hear?
[203:50.08]We're going to do harmony, acapella.
[203:53.90]What song?
[203:54.26]September?
[203:55.46]No, I don't think so.
[204:14.60]You know, let's just do it here.
[204:16.74]I got an idea.
[204:18.60]Let's have them sing.
[204:19.88]For dad.
[204:20.28]Okay.
[204:44.84]So he comes over here.
[204:49.89]So he's over here now, okay.
[204:52.47]So that's saved, so now he's over here.
[204:54.45]So he goes, you!
[204:57.55]So now it's her turn, okay.
[205:06.14]No, no, wait, wait, wait, I gotta, hold on.
[205:11.99]say your god damn I gotta like stop them from talking I wish I could just pick off right where I left off I can't go all the way to the end here there's some things that would change in this app there's a few things alright
[205:42.72]I think I have to make a whole new scene.
[205:46.80]What the fuck?
[205:51.00]Because this is just... Let me get to the end and see if I can add.
[205:57.70]I think I need to do a whole new scene.
[206:01.87]Really?
[206:02.57]No, that can't be fucking for real.
[206:12.09]I can't just like keep this scene but add.
[206:14.71]I'm just going to do a new scene and just put everybody back in here.
[206:27.81]I could delete the other characters, that's true.
[206:35.41]Let's delete them.
[206:47.31]What the fuck are you doing?
[206:49.47]What are you doing?
[206:50.35]Why don't you switch hands?
[206:51.69]Okay.
[207:26.58]Oh dear god.

[211:34.18]Alright, let's get some more characters in here.

[213:14.42]Because my stomach's fucking tearing apart.
[213:16.92]I'm sorry for swearing!

[218:01.55]Hope to see you back.
[218:04.49]When did we do something else?
[218:08.40]Tomorrow?
[218:34.68]Jesus Christ.
[218:38.88]I'm living in a goddamn dream right now, you understand?
[218:41.68]Here we go.
[218:48.70]Alright, who cares?
[218:49.78]Let's get it done, for fuck's sake.
[219:00.64]What did you do?

[220:40.63]Was it actually spaghetti or was it glass?
[220:42.49]I feel bad too.

[220:49.42]I'm fucking tearing apart.
[220:51.32]I'm sorry.
[220:51.76]Alright.
[220:52.82]That's it.
[220:53.10]I'm done.
[220:53.92]That's enough.
[220:55.06]What are you doing?
[221:02.15]What the fuck are you doing?
[221:06.59]What are you doing?
[221:09.02]What are you doing?
[221:12.94]What are you
[222:45.76]Nothing works.
[222:49.18]I can't press any buttons.
[222:50.95]Nothing.
[223:16.16]No!
[223:21.26]Why?
[223:28.81]What the fuck?
[223:33.15]Nothing does anything.
[223:34.65]Can I not even save all the dumb dog shit that I just did for 30, 40 straight minutes?
[223:41.99]Give me a break.
[224:33.64]Dad is mad.
[224:35.20]I want to love this game.
[224:36.30]I really do.
[224:37.74]I really do.
[224:38.66]I want to love this game.
[224:41.48]But there's been like a dickload of technical fucking problems.
[224:46.95]That just kinda- what the fuck?
[224:48.96]This game is so good!
[224:50.26]What the fuck?
[225:07.46]Try teleporting off the table?
[225:20.29]I can't go anywhere.
[225:24.59]No where is safe.
[225:47.60]God dammit, really?
[225:54.68]I don't want to delete anything, I want to save it!
[226:04.96]What?
[226:16.75]Hello?
[226:17.49]What the fuck just happened?
[226:20.85]What?
[227:00.41]Next game.
[227:13.62]Damn it!
[227:14.46]Really?
[227:14.86]The game is so good!
[227:22.07]That's such a fun game.
[227:29.94]I don't know what the fuck happened there.
[227:35.86]We're gonna move on.
[227:37.88]Fuck, come on.
[227:59.59]We got videos to watch.
[228:04.45]Half of them, I don't know if they saved or not, but... Damn it!
[228:10.50]That's so... That was so stupid.
[228:12.48]That took so long.
[228:14.18]That was such a terrible joke.
[228:16.36]I needed to see it play out.
[228:18.72]But... It's probably the labs mode.
[228:23.54]Yeah, that's probably it.
[228:26.41]Shit.
[228:26.87]Oh, well.
[228:28.82]Well, what's there is really, really, really fucking fun.
[228:33.31]I think we're just using the experimental mode too much.
[228:38.29]But, unfortunately, we're going to have to move on.
[228:42.88]Let's watch the videos we made.
[228:45.88]Listen to VRJosh.
[228:47.24]What did VRJosh say?
[228:49.20]Look into the beta build called Mindshow Unleashed.
[228:53.38]It might be more stable.
[228:58.79]oh you know I'll give it a um my show unleashed is the beta more stable that does not sound more stable the beta had a fix for that oh uh we'll come back to it how does that sound
[229:27.20]Who knows?
[229:28.24]Okay.
[229:30.02]Well, what is there is a fantastic, fun little movie maker.
[229:35.36]Just some unfortunate technical issues can plague ABC.
[229:43.97]You know, it's probably a good thing.
[229:45.57]Let's be real.
[229:47.03]That's probably a good thing that that happened because I was all over the place.
[229:52.45]We lost like 450 viewers.
[229:53.40]So we're going to move on.
[229:59.90]I wanted to see that come to fruition, though.
[230:06.62]We're going to move on to... What do I got?
[230:11.71]Disassembly VR.
[230:14.45]Elven Assassin.
[230:16.81]Jet Island.
[230:19.83]Those are the three choices right now.
[230:26.98]I'll give you a vote.
[230:29.62]Why not, right?
[230:35.18]But that was Mind Show.
[230:37.34]For what?
[230:37.66]You know, that was a lot of fun.
[230:39.62]I'll be fair.
[230:41.34]For the weird technical issues.
[230:44.60]And we'll watch them when I come back.
[230:46.86]I'm going to grab one more drink.
[230:48.45]And we'll move on from here.
[230:52.57]When I get back, we'll watch them.
[230:57.84]There's like three things to watch, I think.
[231:01.41]And I will give you a vote for the next stream.
[231:06.83]Or, I mean, the next thing we're gonna do tonight.
[231:11.27]So we got Elven Assassin Disassembly Disassembly How the fuck do you spell that?
[231:26.15]Disassembly
[231:34.93]Uh, Jet Island.
[231:37.13]Something we need to finish eventually, right?
[231:39.97]And Gorn!

[237:47.69]That's the end of the poll.
[237:51.43]Sorry that we had to get rid of Mind Show.
[237:55.61]But had some issues with it.
[237:58.99]Sorry.
[237:59.73]It was a lot of fun.
[238:01.54]It really was.
[238:04.22]I actually had a blast with that game.
[238:10.00]What was available was really, really cool.

[240:01.09]Start over.
[240:03.29]Three, two, one.
[240:06.35]We're locked out of the room.
[240:09.92]We can't get in there.
[240:13.06]It's a surgery scheduled in 20 minutes.
[240:15.08]I know it's a surgery scheduled.
[240:17.18]I scheduled it.
[240:18.22]I'm pretty intelligent.
[240:19.82]Call the cops.
[240:21.20]I did.
[240:24.06]This is unbelievable.
[240:24.68]You gave me a spot.
[240:25.38]I know.
[240:25.66]Hey!
[240:25.88]Hey!
[240:26.06]Hey, you dirty, ugly, ugly stuff!

[240:56.11]Great.
[240:56.23]What's this one?
[240:56.73]Three, two, one, action.
[240:57.83]My father was fairly well.
[240:59.27]He would sometimes come home and
[241:24.17]Chower us with gifts.
[241:26.17]Various toys, trinkets, and the like.
[241:30.61]But my father also brought something else into the house.
[241:33.95]Animals.
[241:36.71]Lots of animals.
[241:39.65]So he was a zoologist by trade.
[241:42.54]And besides the money, which was great, we had an entire zoo in our backyard.
[241:48.70]Well, over the years, one would say that sharing a bed
[241:56.23]But the giraffe, it's not so great after a while.
[242:03.43]We grow distant, him and I. The last time I sculpted him was July of 2006.
[242:11.72]And here's why.
[242:15.56]He killed my mother!
[242:24.23]What is... I don't know what this one is.
[242:25.57]Here's another one.
[242:26.28]3, 2, 1, action.
[242:31.90]Yeah, you will.
[242:32.66]Wait, wait, wait.
