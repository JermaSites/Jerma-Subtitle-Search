[00:03.97]Are you still here, Jerma?
[00:05.27]I'm still here.
[00:06.11]Oh, oh no, okay, he's gone.
[00:07.63]He wiggled.
[00:10.59]So, Hot Pocket.
[00:13.31]A.K.A.
[00:13.79]MLC_St3alth.
[00:16.21]Yeah.
[00:17.79]Let's go.
[00:18.51]Let's, like, let's go adventure.
[00:19.89]Or are you gonna, like, disconnect again?
[00:27.13]I can't believe that, like, disconnects you.
[00:31.61]I'm going as fast as I can.
[00:33.61]Why isn't it working?
[00:37.43]It's like he's having a seizure.
[00:38.59]Oh, there he goes.
[00:47.86]Oh, no, he's still here.
[00:49.20]He's still going strong.
[00:50.32]Oh, there I go.
[00:54.90]I can't believe that actually works.
[00:56.54]So you're just wiggling the mouse around?
[00:58.89]Yeah, hold right as quick as you can.
[01:02.96]I wanna see if this really works.
[01:04.50]You know, I'm like being a troll and pretending to do it.
[01:10.10]As fast as you can.
[01:10.96]Oh, there you go!
[01:11.80]It kicked you, it kicked you!
[01:15.14]You have been disconnected from the server.
[01:17.30]Your turn, Lan.
[01:18.80]What do I do?
[01:19.70]Just... Hold right click and shake the mouse as quick as you can.
[01:23.74]Am I doing it?
[01:24.80]You're like, you're like shaking your head at us.
[01:27.46]Oh, you said shake, you said hit the right click, right?
[01:30.36]Yeah, hold it and just shake the mouse as fast as you can.
[01:32.36]Does it matter if I have a trackball?
[01:35.92]A trackpad?
[01:36.30]A trackball on my mouse.
[01:37.44]You probably won't be able to do it fast enough.
[01:39.82]But I was wondering, what if I, okay, I'll do it with my other hand, wait.
[01:43.01]You're like, you're shaking your head at us like, no.
[01:45.39]Seriously?
[01:46.07]No?
[01:46.59]Nothing?
[01:49.21]No, you gotta like, you gotta like freak the fuck out.
[01:52.26]Pretend there's a spider on your hand while you're holding the mouse.
[01:56.11]Well, no, because I can't just shake the mouse.
[01:57.80]I have to do the ball with my thumb.
[02:00.48]Yeah, it's not gonna work.
[02:02.67]I can't... I can't fool the system.
[02:06.41]Oh, no, yours is like, no, no!
[02:08.49]She's, like, doing this.
[02:12.41]No, you have to, like, you have to make the game think that you're... No, dude, stop!
[02:16.42]We're gonna get, like, banned.
[02:19.38]It thinks we're probably, like, botting the game right now.
[02:23.74]Oh.
[02:31.39]I can't wait to get, like, the Blizzard email tomorrow.
[02:33.55]Like, oh, your account has been terminated because you're, like, botting.
[02:38.38]Seizure time with MLC stuff and World of Warcraft.
[02:43.42]I would laugh so hard if you tried to log in and it was like, um, no, sorry, this account is being, like, investigated.
[02:48.77]It has been banned.
[02:49.41]Alright, I'm back.
[02:51.19]Banned from the WoW universe.
[02:52.37]Oh my god, dude.
[02:55.05]I wonder how...
[03:01.80]This is exhausting!
[03:02.83]I'm like breathing heavily.
[03:13.28]Are you getting carpal tunnel?
[03:15.12]Yes!
[03:20.01]It still hasn't done it.
[03:22.56]Maybe it's, like, learned.
[03:25.42]It's learned that you're real.
[03:27.04]Is he still here?
[03:29.28]No.
[03:29.64]No, he's not.
[03:30.72]You have to do it again, Jeremiah.
[03:33.46]I can't do it.
[03:34.14]I'm such a failure.
[03:35.08]I'm afraid to do it again.
[03:36.16]I don't want to do it.
[03:36.94]Pretend to be a bot.
[03:38.90]I'm literally afraid to do it.
[03:40.56]Why are you afraid of cat?
[03:43.38]I'm scared because I don't want to get my account banned.
[03:47.24]Get your account banned.
[03:49.50]Alright, let's go do something.
