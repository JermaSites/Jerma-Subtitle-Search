[00:19.03]How's it going?
[00:22.15]How we doing?
[00:22.63]We doing good?
[00:29.39]He's early.
[00:29.95]Yeah, I am early.
[00:31.07]I am.
[00:34.21]I'm very early.
[00:35.63]I am at least four minutes early today.
[00:40.43]Very interesting.
[00:46.91]I could be way earlier too, couldn't I?
[00:48.98]I could have showed up at 3.50.
[00:51.80]You know, I saw the messages.
[00:57.72]It's always late.
[00:58.28]It's always delaying.
[01:00.02]But you know what?
[01:02.96]Not today.
[01:06.68]There is a lot of stuff to talk about today.
[01:12.10]Let's start.
[01:14.88]The first thing that we're going to talk about is Katamari Damacy.
[01:19.53]I'm going to be finishing it today.
[01:22.39]We love Katamari.
[01:26.95]We love Katamari.
[01:28.01]I was going to do Zumbini's, but pre-stream chose differently.
[01:32.35]So, that's what it is.
[01:40.82]Why are you doing this?
[01:41.38]You could be eating a big bowl of soup right now.
[01:46.67]I think soup is probably the worst stream snack.
[01:49.93]I don't think that works very well.
[01:53.73]Imagine some streamers eating a bowl of fucking soup.
[01:56.99]In the middle of plan- It doesn't- Soup does not work.
[01:59.09]You ever have a bread bowl?
[02:14.17]Yeah, they're amazing.
[02:18.81]Red Bull and broccoli cheddar soup.
[02:22.84]Pretty good.
[02:25.60]Yeah, we have a lot of stuff going on today.
[02:27.40]So we're going to finish Katamari.
[02:30.16]And later... Final Fantasy XVI sponsor segment for the demo.
[02:36.91]Thank you.
[02:38.25]Thank you.
[02:39.43]Thank you.
[02:42.61]But we'll do that after.
[02:44.89]We're going to finish Katamari before we do that.
[02:50.86]So we're not going to jump right into that.
[02:52.80]Hashtag ad.
[02:56.04]That's right.
[03:02.44]Do you like Final Fantasy?
[03:04.48]I have not played a Final Fantasy in probably 10 years.
[03:09.17]But this one caught my attention because it's action combat.
[03:19.82]Right?
[03:21.50]I think the last time I played Final Fantasy, I was probably, I don't know, maybe Final Fantasy 4?
[03:27.12]Final Fantasy 5?
[03:31.35]But it's kind of like DMC.
[03:33.23]Really?
[03:34.63]Interesting.
[03:40.73]Can you play something else?
[03:41.45]I don't want to be spoiled on Katamari.
[03:44.06]It's all good.
[03:44.68]Katamari's fine.
[03:55.83]What about TF2?
[03:56.37]Yeah, that's the idea.
[03:58.99]Eventually, maybe play some man versus machine.
[04:01.75]Let me clarify the record here for a lot of people that probably were expecting.
[04:06.38]Like I said the words TF2 and I think a lot of people were like, he's going to play TF2 again.
[04:11.76]Hold on.
[04:14.52]I don't know.
[04:15.22]I think I want to play man versus machine.
[04:17.40]I don't know if I want to.
[04:19.66]I don't know what's going to happen with that.
[04:21.87]So it's just an idea.
[04:26.49]He confirmed it.
[04:27.83]What about Peggle?
[04:28.67]You know we're playing Peggle.
[04:30.55]Just not Peggle 2.
[04:31.17]We're playing the original one.
[04:39.04]What about Zoombinis?
[04:41.56]Well, Zoombinis is the next game we're playing.
[04:47.98]The next game we're playing.
[04:53.76]Here's how it's going to play out.
[04:57.49]Katamari Damacy.
[04:58.79]Today.
[05:00.61]Final Fantasy 16.
[05:01.87]Sponsor segment today.
[05:04.47]Zumbinis.
[05:05.95]Another day.
[05:07.41]Like, in the next few days.
[05:10.37]After Zumbinis.
[05:12.07]Sorcery.
[05:13.31]Lined up.
[05:14.48]Sorcery.
[05:21.32]I told you we were doing it.
[05:22.76]On the 24th, but I lied.
[05:24.96]We're actually doing it.
[05:25.80]No, we'll probably still do it on the 24th.
[05:30.21]Somewhere in the middle of that.
[05:32.76]There's more shit to do.
[05:33.66]Something else.
[05:36.44]Did you rest that time you did a wet fart?
[05:47.70]Nah.
[05:48.54]It happens.
[05:49.06]It's alright.
[05:49.36]When are you going to play Skyrim?
[06:02.62]Okay, this is not the game request hour.
[06:09.24]We're just going over the schedule for the things that I want to do for the next week or two.
[06:17.31]Remember, what about the something else?
[06:20.93]Oh, what about the something else?
[06:22.11]Yeah, there was something else, too.
[06:23.35]I forget what it was.
[06:24.41]What was it?
[06:24.79]I don't remember.
[06:26.33]Is there something else?
[06:32.65]You stalling?
[06:34.88]No, not really.
[06:35.48]I'm just chilling, just waiting for people to come in.
[06:37.72]Because we're going to play Katamari.
[06:42.88]Oh, and something else.
[06:44.96]No, I don't think I'm ever going to play Yakuza.
[06:47.99]I'm really sorry, everybody.
[06:50.82]but I don't think that's going to happen.
[06:53.74]It's been so long.
[06:55.02]What's the... You guys have been watching.
[06:57.80]Some of you guys have been watching for years.
[06:59.86]What is the period where if we cross that period, there's no way I will do it?
[07:06.73]No way.
[07:08.59]Let's say I play something and a certain amount of time goes by and I have never gone back.
[07:17.20]A few days?
[07:20.31]Really?
[07:20.63]A few days?
[07:21.83]No, it's got to be like a week.
[07:26.33]Really?
[07:32.30]Yeah, it's at least a couple weeks.
[07:33.80]I don't know.
[07:36.60]I just move on so quickly.
[07:38.04]I really do.
[07:40.42]It's been nine months since you played Sorcery.
[07:43.51]Yeah.
[07:45.87]Open up Street Fighter real quick then.
[07:47.89]Yeah, I know.
[07:51.34]Are you done with Breath of the Wild?
[07:52.64]It's been a few weeks.
[07:53.99]Oh shit.
[07:55.09]You're right.
[07:55.67]It actually has been a few weeks.
[08:08.42]Who cares?
[08:11.08]Who cares?
[08:15.68]Because the zero won the rumble, it is owed as an extra stream.
[08:19.58]Yeah, it's not fair.
[08:21.63]It's genuinely completely fucking unfair.
[08:31.99]I do have something I want to talk about, though.
[08:36.22]This is the something else.
[08:39.22]The something else is what I'm about to tell you.
[08:41.50]So I've been stalling.
[08:44.69]As of right now, are you ready for a major, major fucking announcement?
[08:50.34]This is a major announcement.
[08:54.86]Okay, here we go.
[08:57.64]He's going for it.
[08:58.52]He's going for it.
[09:02.07]As of today, I am now the official chief creative officer of off-brand.
[09:10.15]Let's go.
[09:10.63]Oh shit.
[09:12.39]That was kind of loud.
[09:17.73]Chief Creative Officer for Off-Brand.
[09:21.28]If you don't know what Off-Brand is... No, this is good news.
[09:24.14]This is really good news.
[09:24.90]This is great news.
[09:26.70]I don't know.
[09:27.44]Why are people expecting bad news?
[09:32.56]Off-Brand, if you know Ludwig...
[09:36.70]Ludwig started a company.
[09:37.77]I want to say a year ago now or so.
[09:41.55]We've been talking back and forth.
[09:43.67]It's been a long time in the making.
[09:46.61]No, I'm not pregnant.
[09:54.51]So I think I want to let's just talk real quickly about this because.
[09:58.33]Oh, shit, I'm still on my like starting soon screen.
[10:02.30]Oh, fuck.
[10:03.06]Oh, God, hold on.
[10:05.94]Over the last couple of years, I think a lot of you guys have... I didn't even set up my webcam.
[10:10.60]Oh, no, this is not good.
[10:12.11]It's alright.
[10:12.49]Whatever.
[10:12.73]It's all good.
[10:13.13]I'll just turn this off.
[10:15.35]It's alright.
[10:15.65]It's alright.
[10:15.95]It's alright.
[10:17.65]Here.
[10:17.83]Well, I'll give you something else to look at.
[10:18.87]There you go.
[10:22.37]Okay.
[10:23.03]There's like birds in the background and shit.
[10:24.17]Okay, here we go.
[10:26.52]So I want to say like two or three years ago, we talked a lot on this stream about where I wanted to be in the future.
[10:33.26]And this is all kind of real talk right now.
[10:34.80]I don't want to, um, all jokes aside, I want to kind of get real for a little bit.
[10:40.43]I want to say two or three years ago, I talked on stream.
[10:43.95]I want to say over the course of three or four months about, I want to do shows.
[10:49.87]I want to make stuff and I want to help people make shit too.
[10:55.15]And I floated the idea around of, like, after streaming, right?
[10:58.44]Like, what did I want to do when I was done streaming?
[11:01.50]And some of that, you know, I remember talking to some of you guys in the community being like, hey, what if I helped people make shows?
[11:09.12]What if I got, I try to be in a company, be a creative director or a creative consultant or something like that?
[11:15.12]And I was approached by off-brand to do that very thing.
[11:19.56]So I am insanely excited to work with the off-brand team, the off-brand productions team, with obviously with Ludwig, with Stans, with... There's all kinds of people in this company now.
[11:35.29]He's doing his career voice?
[11:36.43]Yeah.
[11:39.47]Let me tell you what this is not.
[11:43.65]Oh, shit.
[11:44.35]It's... No, no, no, no.
[11:45.39]Okay, so I knew that a lot of people were going to be saying that, so let's address it.
[11:49.49]Let's address it.
[11:50.69]Company Andy, Company Andy.
[11:52.03]Okay.
[11:54.92]The streams going forward.
[11:57.74]I'm not done streaming, by the way.
[11:59.34]I don't know where you're getting that from.
[12:00.90]I never told you that.
[12:02.76]I'm still here.
[12:03.20]I ain't going anywhere.
[12:07.75]I'm not going anywhere.
[12:09.21]No.
[12:11.15]Yeah, still here.
[12:15.81]But I think my focus is going to be obviously... I'm going to be splitting time.
[12:22.90]And I want to spend a bunch of time with off-brand because there's a lot of shows to do.
[12:26.92]There's a lot of things that I really want to bring to the table.
[12:28.88]Do you have a speech ready?
[12:33.45]This is the speech.
[12:36.13]Streams are going to operate pretty much as normally.
[12:39.17]I don't think there's going to be a pretty major change, at least right now.
[12:43.67]But...
[12:44.92]I mean, there's always a but, right?
[12:47.28]I definitely want to spend a lot of time on the project that they're going to be putting me on.
[12:51.72]So.
[12:53.82]I am very, very excited.
[12:56.85]Do you understand how hard it's been to not tell you guys this?
[13:00.23]I think off-brand was going to fucking strangle me.
[13:03.73]There's been so many times where I'm like, oh, can I tell people this?
[13:16.01]They grow up so fast.
[13:17.53]No, no, no, no.
[13:21.99]So, what this means is there's going to be a lot of things that you're going to see that comes from off-brand that I will have had a hand in.
[13:31.14]If you saw the Ranboo show.
[13:32.90]Ranboo show was not part of off-brand.
[13:34.12]I'm just giving an example.
[13:36.46]That was a little bit of this already.
[13:39.69]kind of working with Ranboo and talking to him and being like, what do you want?
[13:43.15]What's your vision?
[13:43.67]What do you want to do for this scene or for this part of the show or whatever?
[13:47.10]Breaking down scenes and writing stuff and helping with creative direction.
[13:53.60]I am so fortunate and so happy to be able to say that that's what I'm going to be able to do.
[13:59.26]Now, I didn't have that huge of involvement in Ranboo's show, but I, you know, I was consulting on a few things.
[14:04.99]But now, as a creative officer and a creative director, whatever you want to call it, I'm going to be involved in almost everything that Offbrand does.
[14:18.72]And it's great because they're all awesome.
[14:20.86]I get along really, really well with Ludwig, of course, obviously, with all the rest of the Offbrand group.
[14:29.95]I'm... I'm gonna cry!
[14:31.67]No.
[14:34.23]No, don't do it!
[14:35.11]Don't cry!
[14:36.07]You're gonna... I'm telling you right now, you better not start crying.
[14:39.88]I'm fine.
[14:42.14]I'm so glad the fucking webcam isn't on.
[14:47.04]Now, I'm excited.
[14:47.82]This is gonna be really cool.
[14:50.28]We'll see how it goes.
[14:50.86]Do a facecam sobbing stream.
[15:02.20]Yeah, so, hey, when you see that off-brand is working on something in the future, yeah, there's an official, I gotta retweet it too.
[15:13.47]And this is all still very new, so obviously there's still a lot that has to happen with, I gotta get completely onboarded into the company, we have a lot of meetings to do before it's like, actually start working on something.
[15:25.58]So it, we're in the very early stages, but it is official.
[15:35.34]So let's just keep doing what we were doing.
[15:38.92]I guess the only thing that you guys really need to know in the future is I am going to continue to stream.
[15:46.38]And I'm going to continue to stream kind of when I want to.
[15:49.46]And when I feel like it.
[15:51.12]And when I think it's going to be a fun thing.
[15:54.28]Now let me reiterate what that means.
[15:57.46]That could mean anything.
[15:59.06]That could mean five days in a row.
[16:02.38]That could mean once in a week.
[16:04.69]That could mean, I mean, think about when the Elden Ring DLC comes out.
[16:08.41]You're talking about, literally, that's going to be all day, every day.
[16:15.76]But, I do have to make it really clear that I have a job now.
[16:23.16]He still hasn't tweeted about his card game, by the way.
[16:26.43]Oh, I've got a few tweets I've got to make, alright?
[16:29.77]I've got a few tweets.
[16:32.48]Oh, this motherfucker went corporate already.
[16:41.16]But yeah, you're not going to see that much of a difference.
[16:44.80]I'm just telling you, I am an employee of a company now and I have duties that I have to do so.
[16:54.87]um this is not I'm still here we're obviously streaming right now we're obviously streaming I'm not going anywhere I don't plan on it either so keep it real I'm keeping it real yeah I'm keeping it real right now you better watch what you say now on stream no no no no it's fine
[17:19.69]Look, I'll prove it to you.
[17:21.03]I just announced that.
[17:22.91]And I'll just say a bunch of bad words, right?
[17:26.59]So then you know that this is like not changing anything.
[17:30.24]Poopoo.
[17:32.14]Penis poopoo.
[17:33.42]See, it's fine.
[17:34.86]I still have a job.
[17:35.52]Wait, I just got something.
[17:39.30]What's this from?
[17:39.72]From off-brand corporate, was it?
[17:43.20]What happened?
[17:50.66]Now, I don't want to give you guys... I'm insanely excited.
[17:55.57]I cannot wait to get started on projects.
[18:00.31]And I hope I do a good job.
[18:01.53]I hope I actually do a good job.
[18:03.13]That's what I really want to do.
[18:04.03]I really want to work with creators and streamers, YouTubers, whoever that wants to do something that will come through off-brand.
[18:11.07]And we'll talk and we'll develop it.
[18:13.80]I'm going to do my best.
[18:15.06]Hopefully I can make everybody, especially everybody here that's been watching the shows and watching the stuff that I've been doing for so long, I just hope that you like the stuff that I do over there too.
[18:27.01]Because I'm going to put the same effort, the same time, I'm going to put as much as I can into each one of these things.
[18:35.41]Let's play Katamari!
[18:41.96]What's the process going to be like working for off-brand?
[18:44.38]Well, that's a good question considering today's my first day.
[18:48.93]So, okay.
[18:52.21]What do we do?
[18:52.83]I was going to walk into the office with a cup of coffee in my hand and just be like, alright, guys.
[18:59.86]What do we do?
[19:00.38]What do I do?
[19:00.88]What do you want me to do?
[19:03.35]I'm just gonna, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have a whiteboard, I'm gonna just pull off the top of the whiteboard pen with my teeth.
[19:11.68]To be like, alright, I got an idea.
[19:15.78]We got you.
[19:17.02]We're gonna get you up at a podium.
[19:18.94]You're gonna be given a presidential speech.
[19:21.48]That's where it starts.
[19:22.34]And I'm gonna write presidential speech, right?
[19:24.94]And I'm gonna go bullet by bullet, right?
[19:26.36]Bullet line by bullet line.
[19:34.03]Fuck, I have to retweet that.
[19:36.81]Yeah.
[19:39.91]I'm looking forward to it.
[19:40.82]I know I don't want to repeat myself that much, but the whole studio seems like it's going to be a really, really great venture.
[19:47.10]Let's go ahead and retweet this because, come on, look at that.
[19:50.16]Chief Creative Officer.
[19:51.20]Come on, Ma.
[19:55.56]Hey, Ma!
[19:57.60]I got a job!
[19:58.31]Hey, Ma!
[19:59.65]I got a job!
[20:02.37]Oh yes!
[20:03.15]It only took him till he was 40!
[20:06.11]It only took him till he was 40!
[20:07.21]But yeah, let's just keep going.
[20:17.67]That's the news.
[20:18.65]That's the thing I've been wanting to share for a little while.
[20:20.59]It's shocking I haven't told you it yet.
[20:29.04]This feels like a milestone.
[20:32.44]I think it kind of is for me.
[20:33.48]Because, I mean, we do make the 40-year-old joke, but... I think there's still a lot of stuff I really want to do.
[20:41.38]And there's a lot of things that I really have left, I think, to say.
[20:43.62]Um... No, I'm not quitting streaming.
[20:48.48]I know a lot of people think that's what this is.
[20:50.42]That's not what this is.
[20:52.57]I'm not.
[20:59.21]Welcome to the workforce.
[21:01.09]Yeah.
[21:02.58]It's the job that you said you always wanted.
[21:04.40]I think that's the most important thing to take away from this.
[21:07.84]This is the... Like I told you, a couple years ago, I've talked about it.
[21:11.26]This is the thing that I really wanted to do.
[21:13.70]And I hope I do a good job.
[21:17.60]If it goes the way that I think it's going to go, then I'm ready to work.
[21:22.79]The job is Chief Creative Officer at Offbrand.
[21:26.27]For those of you that are just trickling in that didn't hear or didn't see the tweet.
[21:35.19]White collar, white collar Andy, yeah.
[21:44.37]Are you gonna move?
[21:45.53]I don't, I, I don't, I don't know.
[21:48.67]All these things have to be taken into consideration eventually in the future.
[21:51.96]I don't know.
[21:53.54]I'm just gonna take it at really one step at a time.
[21:58.38]Wait, he's the chief, he's the chief creative officer?
[22:01.80]That's right.
[22:08.36]He's the chief.
[22:14.71]No, I like Vegas, though.
[22:19.65]I think I'll probably stick around for a while.
[22:21.63]Let me turn up the... Chief Elbertson.
[22:41.45]Alright.
[22:42.07]Hello, honey.
[22:42.71]You're so flown in.
[22:45.15]You make it look easy.
[22:46.67]Flying is actually hard work, isn't it?
[22:50.29]What?
[22:50.45]Roll up clouds?
[22:51.67]We thought this was about flying.
[22:53.93]When did we finish talking?
[22:55.17]Like you can even roll up clouds.
[22:57.99]I want to be like the king when I grow up.
[23:00.86]My gosh.
[23:02.22]Don't give up.
[23:03.88]Clouds can be rolled up, no doubt.
[23:05.22]Of course they will.
[23:06.86]I'm thinking what we did in Katamari Damaskus.
[23:10.43]Rue Chief Elbertson.
[23:18.36]Are you still going to do your own event streams?
[23:20.50]Yeah.
[23:22.22]I know I want to make sure I'm a broken record on this, but I want to make sure I'm very clear.
[23:28.02]Me working for off-brand and being a position at off-brand does not mean that I will not do anything anymore.
[23:35.94]That is not what that means.
[23:38.02]It just means that I'm going to be spending a lot of time working on shows with off-brand.
[23:43.61]A lot of those shows that I would want to do too will probably just be with off-brand.
[23:47.29]Of course they will, right?
[23:51.31]So it's mainly a, I have another set of duties to do that are not just streaming.
[23:59.35]That's what this announcement is about.
[24:00.83]Alright, we have- wait, I'm already this big?
[24:11.80]He said duty.
[24:15.60]I did.
[24:22.50]Why did I have to scream let's go after I announced it?
[24:25.10]I just like, I was like nervous.
[24:28.69]The one, like, clippable moment of like, I am chief creative officer for Offbrand.
[24:33.49]Let's go!
[24:34.03]What the fuck?
[24:36.61]God damn it.
[24:37.39]Oh, I'm all the way up here.
[24:43.18]Let's go!
[24:44.98]Great.
[24:47.96]Wait, how do I pick up anything?
[24:49.91]Oh, I see.
[24:56.29]Are you going to star in some off-brand shows or will you be mainly behind the scenes?
[24:59.94]It really depends on what it is.
[25:05.24]I just want to participate.
[25:12.39]I can't pick anything up.
[25:13.51]I only have three clouds total.
[25:23.96]Which ones can I pick up and not pick up?
[25:27.92]I'm gonna know what the fuck is going on right now.
[25:34.98]Oh, it's these little, little ones.
[25:48.18]Hey, dude, you gonna watch the Golden Knights game tomorrow?
[25:52.44]Yep, looking for the sweep.
[26:01.20]Can I go fast up here?
[26:02.34]Alright, I might have to redo this one.
[26:09.53]It's not going to be a sweep.
[26:12.47]Yeah, it's alright.
[26:13.67]Here we go.
[26:14.93]Wait, get this guy.
[26:26.59]Oh, hold on.
[26:27.53]Check one thing.
[26:28.27]Let me check one thing real quick.
[26:33.86]Make sure I didn't miss anything here.
[26:36.06]Okay.
[26:37.88]Good.
[26:41.25]I haven't even grown at all.
[26:58.97]Where are the clouds I get?
[27:00.05]Oi, cousin!
[27:01.53]Yes!
[27:16.39]Work email is a weird way for you to pronounce solitaire.
[27:24.86]I don't even know how to play Solitaire.
[27:27.50]Alright, so let me just correct that.
[27:31.51]I don't understand how Solitaire works.
[27:33.35]And anytime somebody tries to explain to me Solitaire, I just stop paying attention after the first 10 seconds.
[27:37.79]Because it's just like, I don't, I don't even care.
[27:51.06]This was pretty bad, but it's alright.
[27:57.79]It's not even 200 clouds.
[27:59.19]Careful.
[28:04.57]This is an embarrassment.
[28:08.67]Chief Creative Officer of Off-Brain Kansas cannot have a display like this.
[28:13.35]You know what I'm saying?
[28:17.65]Gotta have at least 250.
[28:28.21]I was thinking about, I didn't want to be like a weirdo about it or anything, but I was thinking about going live and just being like, oh yeah, chief creative officer for off-brand and just be wicked mean for the whole stream.
[28:39.52]And then you'd be like, uh, yeah, uh, you're talking to the chief creative officer of off-brand.
[28:42.80]Like, do you know what the fuck you're even talking about?
[28:45.32]And just have it just be like a nightmare.
[28:47.08]Alright.
[28:49.34]That's alright.
[28:50.08]We're just getting started.
[28:53.93]That would not go well.
[29:04.46]That's how your normal streams are.
[29:10.44]Massive ego.
[29:12.62]I'll move the cursor.
[29:20.00]I got it.
[29:20.46]60% possibility of rain.
[29:21.48]There's no Katamari Damacy without fans, so let's roll up more clouds.
[29:25.32]Alright, that was pretty.
[29:26.24]57% is not good. ...
[29:33.88]Should we add Chief Creative Officer at off-brand to the stream tags?
[29:39.58]Yeah.
[29:40.78]Yeah, that sounds pretty good to me.
[29:42.22]Yeah, definitely.
[29:42.98]100%.
[29:50.09]I like that a lot.
[29:52.01]Who would ever type that in to the search on Twitch?
[29:56.31]Hmm.
[29:56.67]Okay, Twitch.
[29:57.48]Show me streams of chief creative officers of off-brand.
[30:02.00]Oh, there's only one.
[30:03.10]Oh, okay.
[30:11.80]Do they know that you only have a 98.5 IQ?
[30:13.51]Shit.
[30:14.03]Hey, they didn't hire me because I'm smart.
[30:21.59]Maybe they did.
[30:26.32]Who said clearly?
[30:27.40]Alright, whoever said clearly, time them out.
[30:29.78]I made a little joke and they said clearly and I want them timed out for five minutes.
[30:41.93]You're a creative officer, not smart.
[30:44.71]Yeah, not intelligent officer.
[30:53.17]Chief creator of shitting pants.
[30:58.22]No, that would probably get more hits on the tag on Twitch than that one.
[31:06.41]Let's do, who's new?
[31:07.45]Are you new?
[31:08.67]Who's new?
[31:09.85]You're new.
[31:10.31]Nice to meet you, your highness.
[31:13.69]Katamari Damacy is really fun making stars.
[31:15.77]That's so cool.
[31:17.06]So I kind of ended up, I missed it.
[31:19.96]Alright, this one's actually really good.
[31:44.09]Because this is just like a... Alright, you just like... You twisted the knife a little.
[31:47.73]I like it.
[31:49.17]It's funny.
[31:50.69]Chief... Where is it?
[31:52.71]It was funny.
[31:54.09]Chief Visual Learning Officer at Offbrand.
[31:59.82]Yeah.
[32:00.70]Come on.
[32:09.92]All jokes aside though, I'm going to try to do as best I can.
[32:13.43]I really am.
[32:15.90]There's a lot of people that have a lot of cool ideas.
[32:17.62]I would love to develop them with them.
[32:23.90]Hope I do a good job.
[32:28.08]We are what we are because of our tights.
[32:30.48]Safe and snug, fit and fab.
[32:32.14]That's how we'll make this Katamari.
[32:45.29]And you do a Microsoft Excel stream because now you're an executive.
[32:49.99]Well, I... I don't know how to use Excel.
[32:58.71]Okay, 20 centimeters is about this big.
[33:00.23]Ready?
[33:00.47]Here it is.
[33:00.87]Okay.
[33:07.28]So that's how big it is.
[33:09.92]Alright, it's all yours.
[33:11.08]Okay, so I have to make a 20 centimeter ball.
[33:18.45]I have no time limit.
[33:21.73]20 centimeters, by the way.
[33:34.54]Do you even know how to use Microsoft Word?
[33:43.75]I know that, uh, popular belief would have you think that I write all of my ideas and all of my shows on, like, a bag of a napkin.
[33:52.32]Um, that's kind- I mean, that's somewhat true.
[34:00.58]Ludwig- Ludwig tweeted, what did he say?
[34:05.23]Jerma being my coworker is now the coolest thing about me.
[34:12.46]He's such a cool fucking dude.
[34:13.70]He really is.
[34:14.28]Uh... Oh, I'm excited, man.
[34:21.77]Let's do some cool shit.
[34:32.65]My first order of business... ...is in the company break room.
[34:39.35]There must be!
[34:41.88]MIDI M&Ms.
[34:45.26]I'm not even fucking looking at the game.
[35:11.55]walking into walls just reading chat and looking over at mod chat it's a big day alright like we're gonna retry it's kind of it's kind of a wild day today okay I need to make it 20 centimeters oh there's no time limit it's okay but I wasn't paying attention now I'm gonna pick up the uh chocolates
[35:42.12]beatbox now okay
[36:00.05]This is me.
[36:01.53]If we were in the break room, hold on.
[36:04.64]What are you saying?
[36:30.03]I'm sorry, it's a big day.
[36:32.43]Uh, if you were in a break room, you would have another apple juice.
[36:36.24]What?
[36:37.52]Oh, you mean like I would take apples?
[36:39.00]Well, whatever.
[36:39.48]They already know all this.
[36:49.02]This is getting close.
[36:51.05]I wouldn't say it's there yet.
[36:52.31]Okay.
[36:59.25]I think after all these glues.
[37:00.61]What do you think?
[37:01.15]It's almost there.
[37:01.69]A little bit more.
[37:02.77]I think this is good.
[37:04.59]Yeah, this is it right here.
[37:28.58]I'm gonna say that's it.
[37:29.36]Might be too big.
[37:38.99]Who knows?
[37:39.73]Alright, let's find out.
[37:44.57]I've just shown up to work and your boss is never wearing pants or underwear.
[37:50.91]Wait, what?
[37:52.27]Why did I read that?
[37:53.57]Wait, why did I just read that?
[37:55.38]Why did I read that?
[38:06.77]I read that so nonchalantly like it was just a regular message.
[38:10.26]Oh man, there's no wear pants and no under... What the fuck?
[38:14.78]I didn't want to read that.
[38:24.75]I just kept reading and reading and reading and reading and it just didn't stop.
[38:30.95]Why do you read the most unhinged messages?
[38:33.05]Well, I don't know, because everyone's writing salad right now, and there's one fucking weird message in the middle.
[38:51.17]Hey, did they, wait, wait, wait, 14?
[38:53.93]Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[38:56.57]I can do, yeah, I can do better than that.
[38:58.59]So it has to be much bigger than that, okay.
[39:01.48]Let's do it again.
[39:01.90]Okay.
[39:02.16]Move the cursor or I'm going to call your boss.
[39:06.22]Okay.
[39:40.76]Oh, baby crying sounds.
[39:43.58]Oh, this is cool.
[39:44.54]There he is.
[40:13.41]Cool.
[40:15.21]I want to do that one again.
[40:17.67]Which one was it?
[40:18.17]This one here?
[40:18.54]It was this one, right?
[40:27.94]20 centimeters.
[40:28.36]I can do it.
[40:29.12]It's two meters next.
[40:30.71]Is it?
[40:50.56]Oh, we sm- wait, this is different.
[40:57.10]Oh, they change it up on you.
[40:58.40]They don't want you to be able to go in and just grind it.
[41:02.00]Alright, two meters.
[41:07.04]That's way- that's huge.
[41:09.14]Alright, I gotta- There's two or three versions of every level.
[41:19.71]Oh, cool.
[41:20.41]Why did you just fake excitement?
[41:35.66]That was genuine excitement that I turned into fake excitement because I didn't want anyone to BatChest me because I was genuinely excited about having three different levels per level.
[41:44.86]And I was afraid because I was excited about something on the internet.
[41:49.97]And I thought I was going to get yelled at for it.
[42:06.37]Oh, your Brachias just give me more power.
[42:13.13]Give me more of them.
[42:18.42]Alright, two meters.
[42:21.24]Take my energy, Jerma.
[42:23.30]Ugh.
[43:03.56]I just joined, who the fuck is this guy?
[43:05.16]Oh, are you from the tweet?
[43:07.82]Well, my name is Jerma985, Chief Creative Officer of Off-Brand.
[43:14.18]You might know me as the guy that did that Dollhouse stream one time.
[43:20.25]You also might know me from such unbelievable bangers as meme image I didn't make as the most popular thing that's ever happened to this channel.
[43:29.69]It had nothing to do with... I didn't do it.
[43:33.35]Somebody else did.
[43:34.97]They stretched up my face and put me in an Among Us cartoon.
[43:38.99]And... I also talk about food.
[43:43.94]Uh...
[43:52.15]I'm pretty strong.
[43:59.78]I think I'm at two meters.
[44:00.84]Oh, you may have seen me in Team Fortress 2.
[44:09.95]A long time ago.
[44:21.67]Oh, they put it up on the Discord.
[44:23.27]That's funny.
[44:30.30]Okay.
[44:32.04]Did I do it?
[44:34.95]It wasn't even close!
[44:37.31]Shit.
[44:50.85]You probably like The Strange.
[44:51.76]I did.
[44:52.02]I played the original a long time ago.
[44:53.42]Pretty much when it first came out.
[44:55.24]Alright, well these ones are hard.
[45:03.08]We like that in a Saturn.
[45:04.36]Let's pop it up.
[45:14.49]I guess it wasn't that far off.
[45:15.53]1.4 to 2.
[45:16.19]Eh, it is.
[45:28.13]What's this one?
[45:29.43]Oh, Your Highness really is resplendent.
[45:32.03]Yeah, I love studying, so I haven't played Katamari these days.
[45:35.29]I'm really sorry.
[45:36.92]Anyway, I study so much that they cut it off.
[45:39.82]Cut off the electricity to my apartment.
[45:43.42]I do nothing but study, so I don't earn any money.
[45:47.12]That's why.
[45:47.86]I didn't even notice.
[45:49.70]But I do want to study when it's dark at night.
[45:52.76]Your Highness, can you help?
[45:58.61]uh they're sharing an image in the uh in the Discord right now that I cannot publicly share but they're sharing it nonetheless I cannot publicly share that image it's uh it's got you know it's kind of a brand issue I think wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[46:30.09]Oh, I thought that was real.
[46:31.35]I was like, what the fuck?
[46:33.99]Somebody said, just check the website and look at the picture they used for you.
[46:36.39]And it was me sitting naked in the chair.
[46:37.76]I was like, did they do that?
[46:39.66]No.
[46:40.10]Alright, it's edited.
[46:41.06]Oh, shit.
[46:41.58]I was like, what the hell?
[46:42.48]I was like, alright, well, that's the direction.
[46:45.74]Yes, it's a little brighter.
[46:50.68]What?
[46:50.91]No, you're talking about a van?
[46:52.71]We forbid it.
[46:53.31]It's all about us.
[46:56.51]So much larger than life.
[46:57.59]You're the king of all cosmos.
[46:58.79]Alright.
[47:06.16]I agree, that's no good.
[47:07.16]Too dark is no good.
[47:08.50]Somebody said, I have to admit, that would be a creative photo to use.
[47:33.24]Okay, what's going on in the game?
[47:35.56]Anyways, this is our bookish fan, studying by nothing more than the light of the moon.
[47:43.75]Let's give this boy a brighter future, yes?
[47:45.71]Okay.
[47:48.73]Roll up a bunch of fireflies, then roll him up in the Katamari to brighten things up.
[47:53.57]If you can manage it in this time, that would be romantic.
[47:57.07]We know you can do it, honey.
[48:00.83]Fireflies.
[48:04.66]I'll just make it really bright.
[48:10.76]I'll just take it slow.
[48:11.38]I don't want to go too fast.
[48:23.91]Because I'll miss the little crunchies.
[48:27.47]Whatever they are.
[48:28.37]Oh, fireflies.
[48:29.03]No, they're not crunchies.
[48:42.18]Do not eat these.
[48:43.12]No, don't eat these.
[48:43.90]That's right.
[48:46.86]Okay, it's still very dark.
[48:57.86]Hold on.
[48:58.64]I'll look at some other questions and stuff.
[49:07.91]Just looking at questions.
[49:11.39]Anything rolls in that I can answer, I will answer.
[49:21.10]I haven't really started.
[49:23.50]So there's some things that off brands doing that I have not really participated in.
[49:28.20]Because obviously this announcement today and some of the other stuff, right?
[49:32.97]This is kind of starting as of production stuff for like as of now forward.
[49:54.57]Are you gonna wear a suit every day?
[49:55.79]I was thinking about wearing a suit.
[49:58.31]Turning on the face cam and having like Super Mario pajamas on as my pants and stand up at some point to get a coffee and you guys can see.
[50:04.11]I was like, eh, but I didn't have very much time to... I had to... I had to get out of here.
[50:17.18]And then come back with like a Super Mario ice cream or something.
[50:26.71]Alright, it's still dark, technically.
[50:49.06]Yeah, I'm gonna answer... Alright, so here's the thing.
[50:54.10]I will answer questions like, hmm... So, what kind of... No, that's such a softball question.
[51:00.69]What kind of projects do you think you'd be the most excited about?
[51:04.27]Like, alright, did you just give me a fucking layup?
[51:07.57]Is that... Really?
[51:13.29]Somebody... Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm not... Hey, Jerma.
[51:17.39]How much money are you making?
[51:21.65]I'm not gonna answer these questions!
[51:38.38]It's his first day!
[51:40.38]It's my first day!
[51:43.22]It's my first day and I'm playing Katamari Damacy!
[51:48.10]Oh, shit.
[51:49.10]I'm gonna get in trouble.
[51:58.51]Uh, hey guys, where's Jerma?
[52:00.35]We're doing our, you know, day one company meeting.
[52:03.01]Where is he?
[52:05.36]Oh, he's like joking about being naked and playing Katamari Damacy.
[52:09.52]The meeting was at 4.30.
[52:10.38]Alright, if I get to Bride, it should be fine, right?
[52:32.20]Hey, what's the best part about working with off-brand?
[52:35.08]Ah, let me answer that one.
[52:44.79]Hey, Jerma, what would you say your level of excitement is right now?
[52:47.93]Well, I would say it's definitely at least like a 9 or a 10.
[52:51.42]Working with off-brand to me seems like...
[53:01.33]Kind of bright.
[53:13.73]Kind of bright has got to be pretty good, right?
[53:18.95]Oh, I am itching to go.
[53:21.19]I'm itching to just get started on a project and just start typing.
[53:27.33]Get involved.
[53:35.11]If I was your intern, would you make me... use me as a human footstool?
[53:40.67]What?
[53:49.57]No.
[54:03.14]Is that from a TV show?
[54:09.06]I'm not reading chat anymore.
[54:11.32]Look, I got a sponsor segment coming up, so you can't write that shit anymore.
[54:16.93]Hey, I'm the goddamn chief creative officer of Offbrand, okay?
[54:22.93]Let's clean it up a little.
[54:33.12]Ooh, look.
[54:35.40]Wait, it's bright.
[54:36.58]What's wrong with it?
[54:42.77]You can have this thing?
[54:43.73]Oh, it was bright.
[54:47.17]Uh-oh.
[54:57.54]So what do you guys think?
[54:59.38]Let's get some feedback here.
[55:03.32]Because all jokes aside, I genuinely am really, really happy about this.
[55:16.91]What does Offbrand do?
[55:18.85]Offbrand is a company that facilitates multimedia productions.
[55:38.80]You need flashcards?
[55:40.12]No.
[55:43.31]And also too, a lot of these things, I know a lot of people have a lot of questions and I know that we're jokingly, we are jokey Lee answering them, but I be honest, I really, I need to see, we need to see how this plays out, what the workflow is like, what, um, how long I'm going to be spending on certain things and what, uh, who I'm going to be working with every day.
[56:03.94]And, uh, I actually, I it's so new that I probably could answer a lot of these questions in the next few weeks.
[56:18.34]But all I can tell you now is that I'm excited.
[56:24.23]Yeah, so referencing somebody mentioned a good point.
[56:29.99]Like the baseball stream, the Christmas stream, the dollhouse show.
[56:33.81]Those are the kinds of things that I want to be working on.
[56:37.68]And not just that either.
[56:38.60]There's going to be a lot.
[56:40.02]There's a lot of projects that are going to probably come through off-brand that are not dollhouse streams.
[56:45.92]Dollhouse level streams.
[56:49.22]I've made it pretty clear that if there's a cool project to work on, I want to work on it.
[56:55.96]I don't care how much it costs or what if it's... Oh, well, that's not going to be that expensive.
[57:01.38]Well, that's going to be too expensive.
[57:02.68]I think it's just pretty much anything and everything.
[57:04.86]Whatever I can put my hand into.
[57:05.98]Whatever I can try to make better if I can.
[57:09.65]Whatever it is.
[57:10.17]I'm going to try to.
[57:23.08]Will you still stream?
[57:23.82]Yes.
[57:26.12]If you missed the first part of the stream, I did go over that a little bit.
[57:30.26]Streams are not stopping.
[57:33.28]But I do have a job that I have to do and I'm going to have to pay attention to.
[57:38.77]So not going anywhere, not stopping streaming.
[57:48.27]I like this one.
[57:49.55]Can I show this one?
[57:50.45]Is anybody from off-brand here?
[57:52.39]Can I show this one, me as the vampire?
[57:56.31]Can I show that one?
[57:57.15]That's alright.
[57:57.67]That's like that company policy.
[57:59.00]That's fine, right?
[58:06.86]It's me as a vampire as... Well, you'll see it in the Discord.
[58:17.28]I'm going to show it.
[58:19.91]I don't care.
[58:20.73]It's too good.
[58:27.67]It's just too funny.
[58:28.99]I have to show it.
[58:29.55]Imagine if they used this.
[58:48.76]Like that's if I requested that.
[58:54.56]That would be like a personal request.
[59:15.42]What was the most important thing that led you to this decision?
[59:17.65]That's a really good question, actually.
[59:20.15]Thank you.
[59:21.43]Person that obviously did not get planted there to say that.
[59:24.85]They really didn't.
[59:25.49]Like, I'm just fucking around.
[59:26.89]They actually asked a good question.
[59:29.30]So, I have my most fun when I'm coming up with something to do.
[59:37.11]And as much as I lo- I still genuinely enjoy hanging out and playing games and, you know, spending time with the stream and doing this stuff, I am at my happiest coming up with and trying to execute on something just kind of wacky.
[59:53.10]Uh, and that, again, that's not to say that I don't like streaming.
[59:56.40]What just happened?
[60:02.40]A bear, for sure.
[60:03.38]Finally got one.
[60:04.32]Want to go home now?
[60:08.42]Oh, well, I think I'm supposed to avoid the bears.
[60:13.98]You know the rules.
[60:14.66]Alright, good luck.
[60:15.68]What would... Wait, what are the rules?
[60:16.66]I have to avoid them, right?
[60:23.56]You need to get the... How is there a bear in front of me?
[60:32.97]Okay, I need to get a huge bear.
[60:34.39]Well, that's not fair.
[60:47.07]Okay, so I have to get huge without touching a bear.
[60:52.60]Look at that.
[60:53.58]That was my favorite thing.
[60:56.54]What?
[60:57.02]Oh, it's cow themed.
[61:16.78]You guys are fucking just absolutely roasting me in the sub stream.
[61:24.78]So many of these images are popping up.
[61:26.76]It's like I can't even keep track of them anymore.
[61:30.46]Like so many of these with just a different fucked up image is popping up.
[61:39.67]What?
[61:41.11]Where?
[61:41.65]Okay, I'm done.
[61:52.11]That was a fun one.
[62:04.86]Hey, it's really okay, you don't need to say you're sorry Should have just caught them myself, really Oh, well, we get to keep it
[62:48.50]Somebody said, hey, dude, why are you so popular?
[62:52.90]I don't know.
[62:53.74]I don't know.
[63:01.58]And I don't know how popular I really am.
[63:03.08]Am I?
[63:03.20]I don't know.
[63:16.87]Is that dog still in the Select Plaza?
[63:18.45]Woof, it could work out.
[63:19.41]Woof.
[63:21.61]Oh, there's a bunch of those King of the Cosmos missions, too.
[63:29.16]Dog?
[63:30.24]I want to roll up the brightness.
[63:32.30]Somebody else just wanted to do that, too.
[63:43.19]If you found someone you considered funnier than yourself and had the chance to trade fame with them, would you?
[63:47.64]No.
[63:49.06]Absolutely not.
[63:53.00]No, 100% no.
[63:55.08]If you're... Good.
[63:57.52]That's good.
[63:59.83]I'm cool with being where I am.
[64:02.11]I don't want to trade places with anybody.
[64:04.11]Okay.
[64:07.05]What about trading consciousness with someone?
[64:10.59]Um, no.
[64:32.85]we have a dog among our fans yes and she talks and talks this dog hmm what did you say woof want to roll up woof roll up the sun we heard it we heard it loud and clear yes we weren't hearing things amazing yes our course is clear off to the sun we go oh are all the main missions done
[65:04.56]Okey-dokey.
[65:05.58]Want to go for the sun?
[65:06.64]Want to roll the Earth and roll up the sun?
[65:08.40]We know you can do it.
[65:12.34]I don't think I'm quite ready.
[65:37.23]However you've seen this channel over the years, whether you like it or you don't, hopefully you can take something from it that at least, I don't know, makes you feel better.
[65:52.78]If you don't like the stream, if you don't like me, whatever.
[65:55.38]That's fine.
[65:57.16]If you do like this place, if you do like what's going on here, that's great.
[66:00.13]Cool.
[66:01.61]That's all I really will ever say about it.
[66:15.50]I'm never going to be bigger than the sun.
[66:27.10]I think I've tried over the years to... I don't know.
[66:32.74]I'm just trying to do as best I can.
[66:35.04]That's it.
[66:37.28]It's all it ever was and all it probably ever will be.
[66:53.96]You're doing great, sweetie.
[66:56.42]Thank you.
[67:09.27]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[67:11.02]Am I big enough?
[67:20.77]Unfortunately, you peeked at Coffee Cheetos Chicken.
[67:26.38]There's some truth to that, I think.
[67:34.63]Well, there are no more... Let's see.
[67:35.65]There are no more planets.
[67:37.09]Let's see if I can get it.
[67:43.91]Did I get it?
[67:48.42]Oh, shit.
[67:48.82]I got it.
[67:53.99]rolled up the sun it's a huge deal but there's something else that's kind of you rolled the world into one you know we don't really know whether that's a good thing or a bad thing but it's powerful global news
[68:11.08]Earth must be going nuts now.
[68:13.10]Oh, you were rolling Earth.
[68:13.98]I wonder if our fans are alright.
[68:17.06]Ah, we feel something.
[68:18.34]We're feeling the presence of each and every fan.
[68:21.60]Earth is fine.
[68:22.40]Don't worry, Your Highness.
[68:24.20]That's what they're saying.
[68:25.10]Oh, what a relief.
[68:26.58]Come to think of it, this game's mission was to roll a Katamari to, you know, grant fans their wishes.
[68:36.02]There are still other fans on Earth.
[68:41.55]maybe we didn't grant all their wishes yet but then again rolling up the sun is such a happy thing so we're going straight on to the ending the king decrees it so now here's the profoundly moving ending coming up fast it's not the end we have to get ready we'll just go on ahead see you later I know the curse is on the screen I can't get it off
[69:24.62]I could do better than that Anybody here?
[69:53.10]Namco!
[69:59.06]Didn't the creator of Katamari go on to make a couple other games?
[70:21.95]Oh, come here.
[70:24.18]I can't, I can't have people come with me.
[70:32.30]Oh.
[70:54.50]Come on, cousin, run!
[70:55.56]Run, cousin!
[71:01.84]Don't show the vampire anymore?
[71:02.96]I'm gonna get a word in the letter.
[71:10.12]Wait, they're making another one?
[71:26.92]Are they actually making another Katamari?
[71:35.93]Oh, not Katamari.
[71:37.79]Okay.
[71:38.37]I'm turning the volume up, by the way.
[71:40.15]I'm turning the song up.
[71:52.60]Oh, I got grabbed.
[71:59.59]I told you to dodge.
[72:01.11]I didn't know how to dodge that quickly.
[72:05.21]You fucked it up?
[72:15.16]Oh.
[72:15.30]Okay.
[72:28.91]You can replay it.
[72:31.79]I'll replay it and I'll dodge.
[72:34.85]But there's more levels.
[72:35.91]We're not done.
[72:36.31]There's at least four or five more levels to do.
[72:42.48]When are you going to play Monster Ranch or DS?
[72:45.44]That sounds really fun.
[72:50.26]What class should I play in Diablo 4?
[72:54.85]Um...
[72:57.79]the uh sorceress the only one or uh yeah necro drew it all the way I I tried druid I tried werewolf druid and I got to like level 20 something
[73:28.85]And I was just like, I hate this.
[73:40.97]And then I changed to Sorceress.
[73:42.96]I was like, this is kind of fun.
[73:45.54]This game is kind of fun.
[73:47.84]Is it going to be loud?
[73:55.28]I'm turning it down.
[73:56.38]Let's go.
[73:57.28]Oh, you were so close.
[73:59.16]Just a little more.
[74:02.00]Just a teeny bit.
[74:03.72]Just a squash.
[74:05.56]That's always the way it is.
[74:26.89]Just a little bit more.
[74:27.65]Cool.
[74:31.87]Alright, so now... What's this one?
[74:39.29]Hello, it's been a while.
[74:40.13]It's...
[74:42.21]We met in Katamari Damase.
[74:43.37]That was a great experience.
[74:45.59]Looks like it also put the Hoshino family on the map.
[74:49.37]But wait!
[74:50.69]Who cares?
[74:51.29]Earth is in danger.
[74:52.81]Your Highness is the only one who can save us all.
[74:55.84]Please, we need your help.
[75:08.91]Okay, Earth is blue.
[75:10.71]A very beautiful star, yes.
[75:12.71]I hope that it can hold a candle to the great cosmos.
[75:15.99]Oh, honey.
[75:16.47]Hmm.
[75:18.73]Giant asteroid is headed towards Earth.
[75:21.53]Oh, sounds like fun.
[75:23.33]Please help us.
[75:24.09]We're all waiting for your highness.
[75:27.03]All waiting?
[75:28.50]Oh, so you really were waiting.
[75:29.82]Alrighty, we'll totally save Earth.
[75:39.65]Danger!
[75:40.27]Earth is in danger.
[75:41.59]Trouble of the planet is in big trouble.
[75:43.66]If you don't hurry up and roll a really big Katamari, Earth is going to have even more problems.
[75:48.72]This is going to smash into Earth.
[75:53.52]Sounds bad.
[75:56.29]Honey, you have to hurry or Earth is toast.
[75:59.59]Somebody help.
[76:05.73]Oh, you're picking up all the countries.
[76:07.71]Okay.
[76:08.86]Cool.
[76:13.39]Come on!
[76:13.93]How many countries are on Earth?
[76:21.03]Shit, I gotta get, like, all the islands.
[76:24.32]Oh my goodness.
[76:27.04]There goes all of... Okay, but that was all of Europe? ...
[76:50.09]It's almost here.
[76:52.84]Why is the Earth round?
[76:58.12]What's this one?
[77:19.37]Where's the... I should have said, where's the United States?
[77:23.09]I know where it is, I just... I'm gonna get... This is all of Africa?
[77:34.49]I have to get 100%, right?
[77:45.95]Oh my god, it's right here.
[77:50.55]I got USA, Canada.
[77:54.45]Oh, I got Brazil.
[77:57.39]What's left?
[78:02.59]Am I not big enough to pick up?
[78:06.79]I can't pick up Russia?
[78:11.79]Get it.
[78:14.65]That's it.
[78:16.26]Wait, there's like one island.
[78:26.52]Oh no, the Earth is gone.
[78:30.06]No more Katamari Tabasi, I guess.
[78:33.17]I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[78:37.63]Okay, let's go.
[78:54.34]I cannot go fast.
[78:56.90]Retry.
[78:58.36]All the islands around me.
[78:59.26]Move your mouse, please.
[79:02.04]I'm telling you, I can't do it.
[79:08.18]I gotta stay around here and get the islands.
[79:09.64]That's a good start.
[79:17.81]Good start.
[79:29.81]That's a good start.
[79:36.29]Come on.
[79:44.86]Can I get the United States yet?
[79:46.80]No, sorry.
[79:47.28]South America?
[79:50.92]I can't get Brazil.
[79:53.81]I'll come back for it.
[79:57.91]Come on, hurry up.
[79:59.41]Hurry!
[80:02.10]Hurry!
[80:02.60]Hurry!
[80:03.70]What am I missing?
[80:30.80]What am I missing?
[80:32.68]Okay.
[80:33.19]Good.
[80:33.51]Face is fine.
[80:35.05]Face is fine.
[80:58.60]Pace is perfectly fine.
[81:01.40]Got Australia.
[81:01.98]I got China.
[81:05.02]There's Russia.
[81:07.26]Alright, I got it.
[81:08.44]I got everything.
[81:10.32]Did I get everything?
[81:14.85]Did I get everything?
[81:20.89]Did I get everything?
[81:21.39]Get the meteor?
[81:25.25]Holy shit, I didn't think I had to do that.
[81:30.80]I thought I just had to save everything.
[81:38.12]That's like two pixels away, isn't it?
[81:41.48]It's a little further than that.
[81:51.98]What should I make for my birthday dinner?
[81:54.12]Buffalo chicken.
[81:55.58]If you like it, if you can handle it.
[81:58.93]Buffalo chicken subs.
[82:11.23]Everyone on our Earth is alright.
[82:12.53]We just confirmed it.
[82:13.73]It turned out well.
[82:18.57]Cool.
[82:23.38]Tell you the truth, I'd given up.
[82:25.04]But we all managed to survive.
[82:26.26]As a token of our gratitude, we'd like your highness to... Seriously, fabulous.
[82:34.62]Thank you.
[82:35.00]We are so pleased.
[82:37.48]What should we do with it?
[82:46.94]I'm sorry.
[82:52.72]I'm just imagining it being... I'm just thinking if I was like a teacher, it would be such a pain in the ass to get the class to just shut the fuck up and pay attention again.
[83:04.81]Do you know what I'm saying?
[83:08.07]In the middle of teaching, like in a classroom, being like, okay, kids.
[83:11.60]Being like...
[83:16.05]what was that it was I had a late lunch today be like everybody stop talking now stop talk that's enough streaming is so interesting because you may have just laughed out loud at me and I have no idea I'm just still going we're just going
[83:46.16]That was kind of a small Katamari.
[83:50.40]Let's try it again.
[83:58.11]What'd he say?
[84:00.07]Did you forget that you have already told us?
[84:03.13]Already told you what?
[84:03.89]Imagine if you could hear all of us like a laugh track.
[84:16.36]That would be so awful.
[84:19.24]That one time I went into Discord and there was like about 200 people in that call.
[84:26.23]Times that by 10.
[84:32.19]We are not that easy.
[84:33.42]Alright, so we did this one before.
[84:36.10]But I think it has to be big, right?
[84:38.22]Well, not big.
[84:38.68]This one has to be
[84:45.92]We're sick and tired of just making it bigger.
[84:47.66]So we had a notion.
[84:49.28]We had a notion even though we're starving.
[84:52.07]Just try rolling as quickly as possible and get it to about this big.
[84:57.77]You can do it, we know.
[84:59.37]Alrighty, good luck.
[85:02.92]Alright, just get it to 50 and then submit it.
[85:13.80]Do the teacher noise?
[85:15.22]I don't even think I could anymore.
[85:17.04]I have to be, like, really excitable to do it.
[85:20.18]I have to be- I have to be super excited.
[85:47.66]Try it?
[85:48.02]I could probably do it.
[85:49.54]Shit.
[85:49.74]Alright, good.
[86:16.65]I'll be happy if I can do this in two minutes.
[86:19.51]Damn it!
[86:53.44]Get it!
[86:54.54]No, not gonna get it.
[87:23.20]Hurry.
[87:25.18]Okay.
[87:26.23]220.
[87:26.27]That's not great.
[87:27.43]That's not bad.
[87:37.55]I'll try to do it.
[87:38.27]Turn your volume down because it's probably going to be annoying.
[87:41.13]You guys ready?
[87:41.51]Ready?
[87:50.36]Ready?
[88:04.42]50 fucking years old, I still got it.
[88:05.54]Hey, don't ever ask me for that ever again.
[88:21.35]Because I won't do it.
[88:23.60]You understand?
[88:42.47]Oh shit, sorry.
[88:43.05]I was looking at like off-brands Twitter.
[88:45.29]I was like, oh cool.
[88:47.11]What are people saying?
[88:53.46]Do a moment?
[88:54.34]No, that doesn't... We don't need a moment for that.
[89:10.87]Hey, you guys pumped for Final Fantasy 16 demo sponsor segment coming up very soon in the next probably couple hours?

[89:55.78]Extra special training.
[89:58.18]Night school.
[90:01.21]Lots of wheels.
[90:03.99]Let's do night school.
[90:08.38]Oh, that one is the last one.
[90:10.22]No, I just told you we're playing sorcery after that.
[90:12.82]Like, three days after that.
[90:21.45]And then that's the... Yeah, okay.
[90:23.35]I see what's going on.
[90:28.53]Hurry to the school and get them.
[90:29.77]Alright, so I'm the king of the cosmos right now.
[90:42.76]Okay, don't be afraid of ghosts.
[90:45.92]Just hurry and get the forgotten instruments.
[90:48.76]Five in total.
[90:50.32]If you touch a ghost, you have to leave.
[90:56.38]What?
[90:56.64]I need to get the five instruments?
[91:04.32]Are they in this room?
[91:18.35]Okay.
[91:20.35]Recorder.
[91:22.27]Oh, shit.
[91:28.39]Can I leave?
[91:28.85]I can leave.
[91:33.55]Oh my god.
[91:34.25]I'm just gonna hug the wall.
[91:38.17]Alright, take an observation first.
[91:45.37]Where is it?
[91:57.38]OK, there it is.
[92:00.14]How do I climb this?
[92:04.38]OK, wait, can I even get there?
[92:06.64]Do I have to get bigger?
[92:08.98]Oh.
[92:11.32]I'm done.
[92:36.56]Don't touch the ghost.
[92:37.96]I bounced.
[92:38.47]It'd be so funny if you played Five Nights at Freddy's.
[92:53.89]That would be actually pretty funny.
[92:55.71]Okay, what about lots of wheels?
[93:04.08]Okay.
[93:04.84]First, collect the tires.
[93:06.70]Run and run into the sunset.
[93:09.06]Become a charming king.
[93:12.40]You get presents for these?
[93:13.29]Ooh, cool.
[93:14.37]I'm into that.
[93:22.31]You got the katamari faster than usual.
[93:25.17]Run, just run.
[93:26.05]Get lots of tires.
[93:37.57]You gotta be big enough to do that.
[94:12.62]Tires.
[94:18.83]I only have nine tires.
[94:28.18]I need to be big enough to pick up cars.
[94:29.70]Once I can pick up cars, it's all over.
[94:52.64]Alright, come on!
[94:53.62]Level up!
[94:58.97]Alright, I'm gonna be upgrading in a second.
[95:04.89]Here, give me these.
[95:24.11]Boof!
[95:31.39]Well, there's a whole tire factory over here.
[95:33.05]I need to be big enough to pick up the actual cars!
[95:46.02]Here we go.
[96:01.45]Not big enough.
[96:02.23]Shit.
[96:04.71]Alright, where is... Somebody said I was missing tires.
[96:14.48]What about all this?
[96:16.60]Look at these Minecraft houses up here.
[96:18.46]I got 200.
[96:38.10]There they are.
[96:38.54]350?
[96:38.62]You-ow-ow-ow-ow!
[97:07.63]20 seconds, I can pick up cars.
[97:12.19]No, I can't.
[97:13.01]Dammit.
[97:13.45]Sorry.
[97:19.55]YOOOOOO!
[97:32.13]Barely passing?
[97:34.15]The real test starts now.
[97:37.09]Shut up.
[97:37.59]God.
[97:44.38]How did that happen?
[97:51.15]We think we were better than that.
[97:52.21]We aren't a prince.
[97:54.99]50%.
[97:55.45]That's it?
[97:56.13]That's a challenge mode.
[98:12.68]so I did this one I did this one extra special training stop skipping salad uh I don't think there is a salad in this one I'm gonna do the 17 minutes to make a huge one again because I think I can do better than I did
[98:38.03]Collect fighting spirit and seize victory.
[98:43.68]Become a brave king.
[98:44.84]Yeah, these are new.
[98:45.32]These missions are new as of the remaster.
[98:53.16]Shadowboxing boxer.
[98:54.50]Very sexy.
[98:56.79]If you get burning fighting spirit, your punches will get stronger.
[99:04.89]Roll until you're ashes.
[99:08.53]What is that?
[99:09.15]Okay, I'm imagining... Does it get... Okay, the water does not affect it.
[99:18.30]You just have to get burnt?
[99:38.23]Street Fighter VI.
[99:39.39]I'm not picking anything up besides the fire, is this a mistake?
[100:11.41]Oh, hold on.
[100:12.05]Look at this.
[100:18.21]There we go.
[100:25.30]This song's pretty good, huh?
[100:31.15]Yeah, I think I have this set to favorite songs.
[100:32.93]That's why it keeps playing.
[100:45.18]This is one of those songs, this is such a summertime, windows down, volume up, cruising kind of song.
[101:16.09]Not too loud.
[101:16.87]Not too loud.
[101:19.07]Loud enough to enjoy it, but not too loud to distract your driving.
[101:37.78]Not too loud.
[101:41.72]Centrist Andy.
[101:45.10]Yeah, turn it up!
[101:46.90]Turn the volume up!
[101:48.94]Let's go pump it!
[101:50.28]No, but not too much volume.
[101:52.58]Maybe like a little more than halfway is fine, though.
[102:01.69]Battle Damacy roll time?
[102:04.13]Oh.
[102:09.77]Oh, you got your salad.
[102:10.55]Yeah, there it is.
[102:15.51]I have not completed one of these.
[102:16.63]These are tricky.
[102:29.76]Salad.
[102:32.30]I think both quiet and loud volume have pros and cons to consider with that face of me moving around and talking quickly.
[102:38.50]No, that is accurate.
[102:45.02]you're saying is the truth there is a time and a place for low music and loud music I'm sorry I'm sorry if I offend anybody here but if I go out I'm at an establishment and I want to I want to go out and have you know have a couple drinks and talk I want to be able to hear you talking I'd like to hear you speaking here we go here he goes here he goes here he goes
[103:13.80]I would like to hear you talk.
[103:19.03]A lot of establishments play very, very, very loud music to the point where you're talking over a vacuum cleaner for the entire night.
[103:31.62]I propose a separate room in every establishment that is closed off
[103:40.29]That is the same building.
[103:42.15]It's just a place to go to get away from the loud music.
[103:48.45]This place can be decorated the same.
[103:50.36]It can be the same spot.
[103:51.18]It's just, hey, this is a room here that's like a little bit quieter.
[103:55.74]You can have a conversation if you want.
[104:08.56]No, I don't- I'm not talking about a- I'm not- I want like a sens- a sensory room?
[104:13.43]What is it?
[104:13.69]What do you mean a sensory room?
[104:17.63]I didn't even pay attention to what this was.
[104:22.13]What?
[104:22.43]No, I'm saying it's this- Wait, what?
[104:31.94]And then you turn your head, tilt, and aim your ear at their fucking mouth.
[104:38.25]Huh?
[104:40.49]I have to aim my ear directly at your mouth talking.
[104:44.87]And lean in.
[104:46.07]And lean in and put my hand up.
[104:47.77]And tilt.
[104:51.25]I didn't pay attention again.
[104:59.94]Don't give up.
[105:00.40]Won't allow it.
[105:01.68]Roll Katamari until you collapse.
[105:04.16]Become the king of all cosmos.
[105:10.16]Anytime I'm at a place where there's a bunch of music playing, like a bar, or... It's just like, I want to hear you talk.
[105:19.47]Hey.
[105:20.81]Let's go, then.
[105:21.81]Let's go, then, you know, have a few drinks and talk.
[105:24.85]And, like, you know, let's do some interpersonal communication.
[105:31.48]Yes!
[105:32.06]I think we can do this!
[105:41.96]I just asked if I wanted to get fucking pizza.
[105:44.22]And then I said yes.
[105:45.38]And then everybody at the end of the night, everybody at the end of the night sounds like this.
[105:49.66]Yeah, yeah, no, I'll call you to see what you're up to tomorrow.
[105:53.80]Yeah, give me a call when you have a chance.
[105:56.78]I'll probably get up at like 11 or something.
[106:00.93]I want interpersonal communication.
[106:12.90]Hey, look, I get it.
[106:20.55]Sometimes, sometimes you just want to just fucking rock out to some music and you don't want to talk to fucking anybody.
[106:27.31]I don't want to talk to some fucking asshole.
[106:29.86]I just want to rock out.
[106:31.98]Yeah, that's fine.
[106:34.80]Absolutely.
[106:36.04]Go for it.
[106:49.33]I was supposed to be picking up ballerinas, and I have not found one.
[106:51.69]You know how places do, like, oh, we're doing loud music Fridays.
[107:12.95]I would love for a bar or, like, a place to go, like, hang out or, like, anywhere.
[107:19.07]That would be like, hey, this is, uh, quieted down Fridays.
[107:24.72]Where we play the music 50% softer.
[107:26.84]And... Quiet reading time.
[107:27.80]Okay.
[107:45.43]No, it's not a library.
[107:46.59]They would be playing music.
[107:48.41]Just loud enough where you can actually talk to people.
[107:53.25]Look, I like loud environments too.
[107:55.07]It's not that I don't like a loud environment.
[107:57.55]It's just there's an environment where I want to talk to people.
[108:01.50]And when you stand around in a circle with four or five buds and you all have a cocktail in your hand and everyone just kind of looking at each other because I know I'm not going to be able to hear you.
[108:11.42]So I just kind of sip the drink and nod at you.
[108:16.58]sip and nod at you and then walk the other direction do you start every conversation with I would like to start a dialog
[108:45.91]Bro, just go to the grocery store?
[108:48.14]No, but I'll tell you, the grocery store is a good example of the kind of level of audio that I am looking for.
[108:57.86]That is the level of audio that I am looking for.
[109:01.06]And look, every now and again, you know, when they play tequila.
[109:04.11]It's like, alright, turn it up.
[109:11.23]If I'm talking to you, and we kind of have our drinks, yeah, so I think about that business meeting.
[109:15.97]I'm going to be like, alright.
[109:21.67]You understand this is going to get loud, so we're going to rock out, right?
[109:25.30]I'm rocking out to tequila.
[109:30.02]And by rocking out to tequila, I mean putting the straw up, sipping the drink, and just, like, moving my shoulders left and right.
[109:38.27]Just, yeah, tequila!
[109:47.20]And then someone does the Pee-Wee Herman, and everybody freaks the fuck out.
[109:51.10]Every time.
[109:52.06]You, I'm telling you right now, if you want to make sure that you are... You are awesome at one of these, at a party or something.
[110:01.51]If Tequila comes on, and you do the Pee-Wee Herman dance, you just made like 10 new friends.
[110:07.85]At least.
[110:19.32]I'm not doing this right at all.
[110:29.66]Everybody knows that intro.
[110:34.25]What the hell is the Pee-Wee Herman?
[110:36.95]It's the two fists closed, right foot out, sticking out, bent at the knee.
[110:43.63]And it's you go forward, tap, tap, your fist closed together, hitting your thumbs together.
[110:49.37]And then you go back with the right foot behind the back with the fists.
[110:55.71]I would show you, but I don't have pants on.
[110:57.27]That person that said that was right.
[110:59.07]Alright, I gotta find ballerinas.
[111:05.50]Just go to YouTube and type in Pee Wee Herman Dance.
[111:07.98]You'll find it.
[111:08.38]How big are these ballerinas?
[111:28.13]There's kind of like people like this, or are they smaller or bigger?
[111:31.41]How do I... What am I looking for exactly?
[111:34.27]I know what top left, but... I accidentally picked one up early.
[111:45.10]I don't know.
[111:56.96]Focus on getting bigger first.
[112:00.08]This game is fucking fun.
[112:14.09]But here's the problem though.
[112:15.47]Make sure you're the first one to do the Peewee Herman because someone's going to upstage you.
[112:20.05]You'll know, because the second that that song comes on, someone's going to put the drink down.
[112:24.85]They're going to be like, oh, fuck, this time.
[112:26.68]Like, can you hold this for a second?
[112:30.40]Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't.
[112:32.40]No, no, I'm not going to hold your drink.
[112:35.14]And then you go, hey, hold my drink.
[112:36.08]There's somebody else.
[112:39.87]You got to make sure you do it first, because if you're the second person to do the Pee Wee Herman tequila dance.
[112:44.95]Oh, come on.
[112:47.49]Yeah.
[112:52.35]Joe already did that.
[112:59.55]Gotta make sure you're the first one.
[113:04.27]Who's Joe?
[113:05.25]I don't know.
[113:11.06]Go put some fucking pants on and show us.
[113:14.42]You already know what it is.
[113:15.48]You just want me to embarrass myself on webcam.
[113:18.52]Which, I get it.
[113:20.18]I can understand you.
[113:21.34]I understand where you're coming from.
[113:25.78]No, no, dude.
[113:26.28]I don't get it.
[113:26.92]How does it work?
[113:30.14]Look at this fucking idiot.
[113:37.06]Okay.
[113:37.60]I think I'm picking up.
[113:47.94]This game just became a hidden object game.
[113:50.68]And I'm not very good at it.
[113:53.52]Have you guys seen any so far?
[114:03.80]How would you do this in under two minutes?
[114:13.26]Oh, right there.
[114:25.91]This one's weird.
[114:26.55]What the hell?
[114:32.40]I'm not big enough.
[114:46.41]Still too small?
[114:53.21]How am I still too small?
[115:07.57]I see it.
[115:08.13]I just can't.
[115:08.81]I cannot pick up the ballerina.
[115:10.03]To get a little bigger.
[115:22.52]These fishes were just dancing.
[115:32.27]I just saw the peewee dance.
[115:33.21]It looks like fringe.
[115:42.23]What do we do with them?
[115:45.33]You know what I mean?
[115:45.99]Like... That's... What?
[115:53.11]Huh?
[115:57.80]In Mod Chat, Pee Wee Dance is just the first Fortnite dance.
[116:02.58]It actually is.
[116:04.44]That's true.
[116:16.73]Alright, this is only for you guys' ears only.
[116:22.08]The next time that I show up on camera, I will do the Pee Wee Herman dance to any music that pops up.
[116:31.89]And I'm talking about, I could be with a bunch of other people.
[116:35.18]Like, I'm doing the peewee dance.
[116:37.06]And next time that I'm on stream, this one or whatever one, if music starts playing, and it's danceable music, I will do the peewee Herman.
[116:48.69]And see what happens.
[116:52.63]Okay, now I can definitely pick people up.
[117:01.30]Okay, there we go.
[117:01.94]There's two.
[117:07.76]Probably out of this area.
[117:09.16]Do you see any?
[117:22.83]There's one.
[117:23.95]Alright, one more.
[117:26.77]Way too much time on this, by the way.
[117:30.03]Way too much time.
[117:37.85]I would avoid the person doing the peewee dance.
[117:41.71]That's alright.
[117:42.29]That's alright.
[117:46.40]Me and the buds will be having a grand old time.
[117:48.58]We'll be having a good old time.
[117:54.20]Where?
[117:56.88]Where?
[117:57.96]By where you started?
[118:28.77]We're gonna hold you to that.
[118:29.59]That's fine.
[118:32.34]No, that's fine.
[118:36.26]Please hold me to it.
[118:53.43]Over here?
[118:59.65]Oh, right here.
[119:06.84]Alright.
[119:10.58]Well, that was so long, but I did it.
[119:24.82]Fucking finally.
[119:29.35]Okay.
[119:30.15]As long as me and the buds are having fun.
[119:31.63]Take eight minutes.
[119:34.68]Take five minutes.
[119:35.36]Doesn't matter.
[119:35.96]You do you.
[119:44.94]Alright.
[119:49.78]Okay.
[119:51.04]So this last one is this one.
[119:54.73]Study time.
[120:00.87]Can we please restart the debt arc?
[120:04.25]The debt arc never came to a conclusion.
[120:08.92]You want some insider info of the debt arc?
[120:11.84]I tried to close that joke a half a dozen times at least, and I kept failing the bets and kept making the price higher.
[120:22.22]Trust me, I tried.
[120:23.04]It's like, okay, a billion off the debt if I do this.
[120:26.28]And I just wouldn't do it.
[120:27.16]I would fuck up every time.
[120:28.40]It would never happen.
[120:30.27]I was always increasing it.
[120:32.39]Even when I thought I was decreasing.
[120:33.71]It was something I knew I could do.
[120:39.39]End it now.
[120:43.02]Solve it.
[120:46.52]I'm so glad you stopped talking about it.
[120:48.90]Well, it just got to a point where I kept screwing up.
[120:53.46]Clean up quick and... Oh, I only have a minute.
[121:05.01]A minute?
[121:06.35]How am I going to do this in a minute?
[121:20.14]Actually, it's not that much.
[121:30.07]I did it, right?
[121:50.99]Yeah, I got enough.
[121:58.12]Barely passing and still passing.
[121:59.92]Wheeze.
[122:15.79]Can I, um, whatever.
[122:21.21]You guys are on today.
[122:22.91]You guys are on point today.
[122:24.09]Cool.
[122:28.92]Alright, I want to go do... I want to go do this.
[122:38.10]Did all these.
[122:38.68]That was pretty fun.
[122:39.78]I want to do some more of these.
[122:48.40]Where's the big one?
[122:50.10]The elephant, right?
[122:52.22]I have to get that one much better.
[122:53.58]Oh.
[122:56.56]Something new over here.
[123:02.37]What's new?
[123:02.89]Is it you?
[123:05.27]Cousins, second cousins, I want to play with them all.
[123:07.29]Hurry and roll them all up.
[123:10.89]What do you mean?
[123:16.39]Get a bunch of cousins?
[123:25.84]Alright, here we are.
[123:32.19]No?
[123:32.39]I need them all.

[126:28.89]How do you miss an elephant?
[126:31.00]It's called... The screen is showing lights and colors at me, but information is not being processed.
[126:39.58]I am just up here in my head.
[126:41.86]Nothing else is going on.
[126:43.28]The screen is just colors and lights.
[126:46.00]There's nothing on it.
[126:48.11]When I start talking, I'm just looking at chat and stuff.
[126:52.71]Alright, let me try to make this one big.
[126:53.93]I want to get this one done right.
[127:01.14]I'll do it right.
[127:13.19]There's no way you're dodging a Battle Axe.
[127:21.07]You can think that's fine.
[127:22.23]A thousand meters?
[127:32.56]Oh shit, okay.
[127:45.11]Hmm?
[127:45.99]Play The Last of Us.
[127:52.25]Oh, I feel like I missed... I missed that big time.
[128:02.57]Why are you just skipping over the laugh?
[128:08.04]What laugh?
[128:12.76]What laugh?
[128:14.15]With the mouse I have to scream!
[128:33.55]There we go.
[128:41.57]Oh, we can talk.
[128:42.11]It's still just three meters.
[128:44.19]You're going for a thousand.
[128:45.65]Well, with such a long way to go, how about having some fun with the rolling?
[128:49.10]Like, roll backwards the rest of the way.
[128:51.16]Or trying a roll or two with your eyes closed.
[128:54.04]Of course, there's no benefit whatsoever, but it could be kind of fun.
[128:57.24]Maybe.
[128:57.56]Can we get over here now?
[129:07.61]I never played Stray, no I didn't.
[129:12.86]Uh, I'm not ready to go that way yet.
[129:33.03]You unironically promised Paper Mario a thousand year door back in 2017.
[130:01.66]Okay.
[130:02.39]Well, I'm going this way.
[130:19.54]You also said you're going to play Ark 2 when it came out.
[130:22.02]No, I did not.
[130:23.24]That's reaching.
[130:24.54]You are reaching really far into the memory bank here.
[130:26.90]No, I never said that.
[130:29.49]When did I say I was going to play Ark 2?
[130:38.77]Get the clip, get the clip.
[130:40.01]There is no clip of me saying, yeah, man, I'm really excited to play Ark 2.
[130:44.45]I don't... I don't think that's ever came out.
[130:47.59]That sentence has never been formed out of my mouth.
[130:52.27]I definitely didn't say it.
[131:03.96]Careful.
[131:05.52]Huh.
[131:11.59]You never played the Barbie horse adventure game either.
[131:16.85]Yeah, but you gotta give me a little give me a little bit of slack here.
[131:20.01]There's how many video games exist?
[131:24.79]Ever.
[131:24.97]There's a lot.
[131:28.88]There's a lot of them.
[131:35.52]Are there more than 500,000 video games that have released?
[131:42.17]I made just about a thousand YouTube videos before I started really streaming on Twitch.
[131:48.54]And I've streamed like, what, like two or three thousand times?
[131:56.49]Like at least a couple thousand times.
[131:58.43]That means I've only played like 3% or 5% of every video game that exists.
[132:07.96]What is this shit?
[132:19.30]I'm just laughing already.
[132:20.77]What's even funny?
[132:26.79]I really am Beavis and Butthead combined as one person.
[132:29.55]What the fuck are you talking about?
[132:33.10]Ark 2 Vin Diesel is the character.
[132:36.76]I don't understand what we're watching here.
[132:39.82]That was a fan fiction.
[132:41.68]That's right.
[132:42.46]Ark 2 starring Vin Diesel.
[132:45.10]Somebody made that in Blender.
[132:46.59]One more announcement for all Ark fans.
[132:48.25]What?
[132:48.55]Check this out.
[132:50.58]I didn't say I was going to play it.
[132:53.26]I have to play that day one.
[132:55.68]Well, you're an idiot for saying that.
[132:57.00]Dude, why are people pulling out these receipts?
[133:11.16]Grump Clump.
[133:12.66]You said you were going to play Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg.
[133:17.07]It looks fun.
[133:17.95]I'll add it to the list when slash if a GameCube night comes back.
[133:24.69]This is a year ago.
[133:25.57]You should do an ice cream making stream.
[133:40.28]That sounds actually really cool.
[133:41.34]I like that idea.
[133:46.16]Thank you.
[133:48.16]I got it.
[133:50.22]Don't let it happen again.
[133:51.15]I'll try, Jesus.
[133:55.05]Settle the fuck down.
[134:12.24]I could read you guys the list of games that I have.
[134:14.60]And it dates years back.
[134:16.30]And some of the stuff I just have never opened.
[134:17.91]That sounds fun.
[134:20.79]Put it on this list.
[134:22.05]And then I never open it.
[134:28.54]One day we'll also have to go over the, you know, when you talk about like retirement, retirement.
[134:33.63]I definitely want to go over with you guys all the ideas that I wish I could have done and just didn't.
[134:40.81]And we'll just kind of go over them and rank them on a tier list of what you guys, what you guys think would have been the best one.
[134:46.88]And I'll do that one.
[134:50.25]You know what I mean?
[134:51.69]We'll go over the... I'll open my fucking notebook.
[134:55.01]We could go over like the 30 different stream ideas that I've wanted to do.
[134:59.62]And we'll rank them.
[135:01.46]And then I'll do it.
[135:07.24]I'll do the one that's the highest rank.
[135:19.45]You're streaming until you drop dead.
[135:22.99]Okay.
[135:27.74]You fucking maniac.
[135:34.43]You're streaming until you drop dead.
[135:45.89]No, I have an idea.
[135:47.09]I know what I'm doing for the retirement stream.
[135:49.73]Oh, I know.
[135:50.97]It's been... I've had it ready.
[135:53.36]It's been up here.
[135:54.00]I know exactly what it is.
[135:56.76]It's gonna be... humorous.
[136:09.25]It makes me laugh.
[136:10.97]It makes me laugh every time.
[136:13.41]Because, like, I don't know.
[136:14.29]It's kind of... It's kind of, like, fucked up, but whatever.
[136:18.67]Not really, but it is.
[136:19.65]It's just... I think it makes me laugh, so I don't care.
[136:31.84]I want to tell you one of the jokes so bad, but if I do actually go through with this, then it'll be worth it.
[136:36.30]And just not... And just waiting until whenever that happens.
[136:44.66]It's kind of fun to just relaxingly play this game.
[136:47.20]Just like roll over stuff and get bigger.
[136:49.13]This is fun.
[136:49.55]I like this game.
[136:55.51]Yeah, I pro- No, I'll show the Aaron Fart video before I retire.
[136:58.59]I promise.
[137:02.99]I'll release all of my draft tweets.
[137:05.36]No, I will.
[137:14.13]Stop making promises you're not going to keep any of these.
[137:26.10]Can we talk about candy or something instead?
[137:39.96]No, don't worry.
[137:41.62]Don't worry.
[137:52.47]You're gonna be digging your grave here by making all these promises.
[138:07.76]Give me the housing.
[138:09.70]How's your talkie addiction going?
[138:12.19]Oh actually.
[138:15.27]So here's a funny little story.
[138:18.39]I started drinking beet juice.
[138:22.84]And.
[138:23.02]I. Like I don't want to say like 12 hours later.
[138:30.58]Beet juice.
[138:31.72]B as in berry.
[138:34.50]B as in berry.
[138:35.96]E-A-T.
[138:36.90]Beet juice.
[138:37.72]No.
[138:38.02]B-E-E-T.
[138:41.10]How many E's?
[138:42.84]Chief Creative Officer of Off-Brand.
[138:44.44]How are you?
[138:44.88]Good.
[138:45.08]Nice to meet you.
[138:45.98]Kick my hand.
[138:46.52]There you are.
[138:47.22]Yeah.
[138:48.13]How do you spell beets?
[138:50.21]I don't know.
[138:50.67]B-E-E-T.
[138:57.56]B-E-E-T juice.
[138:59.94]Not meat as in M as in Mary.
[139:09.35]Okay, the whole punchline with this is I peed right red and I thought I pissed blood and I freaked out.
[139:17.66]And I thought it was the Takis that I ate.
[139:19.18]I was like, no, I can't be asking me the Takis.
[139:21.78]Takis were red.
[139:24.27]But no.
[139:26.61]I did not know this.
[139:27.29]Apparently some people, like 20% of the population, if you drink beet juice or if you eat B-E-E-T-S, you pee red.
[139:46.78]No, you don't.
[139:47.22]If you drink beet juice, your pee is red.
[139:58.68]This is weird.
[140:04.68]Somebody lied to you?
[140:06.92]No, they did not.
[140:08.90]Because every time I've drank beet juice, a day later, I have a full red piss.
[140:15.02]Like, oh, that's a lie.
[140:16.06]It's like pink.
[140:17.70]I'm just embellishing because I'm a fucking live streamer and that's all we do.
[140:37.16]You are fucked up.
[140:40.26]I'm really not.
[140:41.20]I think... Just eat some beets and then tell me how you feel.
[140:45.11]Probably will feel pretty good because they're really good for you.
[140:46.71]Kind of tastes like dirt, though.
[140:49.59]Alright, I think I can get a lot of these buildings here now.
[141:16.70]Does it taste like goat cheese?
[141:18.03]It's in that same world of goat cheese flavor where it has that kind of very soily kind of dirt sort of.
[141:25.36]It's kind of like dirt.
[141:38.76]Name five historical landmarks on this map.
[141:42.22]Taj Mahal, Great Wall of China, Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
[142:08.62]and then big London
[142:40.72]Oh.
[142:51.48]I love this no time limit routine.
[142:53.74]That's great.
[143:06.02]Big London's the name of the bell.
[143:09.46]Cool.
[143:18.24]Have you ever really gotten mad at chat before?
[143:20.02]Oh, yes.
[143:24.28]Yes, it has happened.
[143:27.77]I have been streaming for like seven years.
[143:32.07]Yes, there's been at least one or two times where I've been like, what the fuck are they saying?
[143:35.91]What do they know?
[143:39.66]It's had to have happened at least once.
[143:53.27]Getting there.
[144:09.21]When we're full of contrarian Andes, he gets sassy.
[144:13.21]Can I get?
[144:16.23]Nope, not yet.
[144:30.53]You spent two minutes mocking me one time because I said that one of the nerds in Sam & Max sounded like you.
[144:40.33]Um... Okay.
[144:43.31]But we're... This is a two-way street.
[144:47.07]I... It's not like, oh yeah, remember that time that Jerma got... Yeah, yeah, Jerma gets mad in chat all the time.
[144:54.42]Remember the time that we berated him until he fucking got angry at us?
[145:00.94]You're leaving out a very important part.
[145:06.33]Yeah, remember that time the Jerma got really upset?
[145:08.09]Yeah, it was weird.
[145:10.11]I just said his hair looked like shit, and he smelt like yellow M&Ms.
[145:14.65]And that I think that he, uh, his, his eyes, uh, his eyes are too close together.
[145:20.89]That's all I, I don't, why did he get mad at us?
[145:23.45]Why did he say, I don't understand.
[145:25.09]Why was he so upset with us today?
[145:43.51]What's the maddest you've ever been on screen?
[145:45.42]I don't know.
[145:45.94]I'm trying to think of some real genuine moments where I was actually really, really unhappy.
[145:57.64]They're very far, few and far between.
[146:00.14]Because, I mean, no more jokes, let's be real.
[146:03.56]I treat this stream, I mean, like, the whole point of this stream is kind of just fucking around.
[146:08.82]I just like having fun.
[146:11.30]It's fun to kind of just mess around with a bunch of people.
[146:15.53]It's fun.
[146:18.27]I don't take what I'm doing here.
[146:22.01]Well, I do take it seriously.
[146:23.59]I take fucking around really seriously.
[146:26.45]Does that make sense?
[146:29.71]I take messing around really seriously.
[146:36.42]But, besides that, I just treat this as like a fun space where I'm not really... I know that we're all kind of messing around for the most part, so...
[146:49.37]Yeah, sometimes somebody comes in and just like, oh, this guy's a fucking dickhead.
[146:52.59]And I was like, okay, whatever.
[146:56.92]But like 99.9% of the time, it's just like, it doesn't bother me.
[147:03.92]And I know people just have fun.
[147:08.15]Yeah.
[147:23.54]I'm going to assume this person's accusing me of being bald.
[147:27.40]Let's see.
[147:29.78]What did you say?
[147:34.39]Be honest.
[147:34.85]Is this the reason why you haven't had a face cam on?
[147:37.65]Oh.
[147:38.83]Wait, what?
[147:39.11]Oh, I thought you were going to say be honest.
[147:41.15]Do you not have a face cam on because you're bald?
[147:42.97]That you don't want to show anybody?
[147:48.10]No.
[147:48.96]I'll let myself answer that.
[148:01.17]Self-reporting, yeah.
[148:05.73]It's gonna happen.
[148:09.29]I wonder... When I do start to really show... When I start to show that I'm going bald... Which I don't think I'm gonna... I don't think it's really gonna happen, but... What do you think is gonna be more important to the community?
[148:25.42]Bald guy or short guy?
[148:29.67]That's a conundrum.
[148:36.34]I wonder how you guys are going to take it.
[148:38.06]Will it always be like, oh, he's kind of short.
[148:40.14]Or will it be bald?
[148:40.86]Bald, he's a bald guy.
[148:41.56]Bald would be fresh?
[148:45.38]Why can't you be bald and short?
[148:48.66]Maybe you're going to pick one.
[148:50.86]I know you.
[148:58.97]I know you.
[149:00.57]When I turn the webcam on and I'm bald for the first time, or like balding, you're just gonna write bald.
[149:07.13]You're not gonna write short and bald.
[149:09.41]No, no, no.
[149:09.79]That's far too much.
[149:10.39]You're just gonna write bald.
[149:13.76]That's it.
[149:19.90]I'm gonna make it really hard for you.
[149:21.06]I'm gonna... I'm gonna stand next to like a measurement tool that says like 5-5 on it.
[149:27.64]But I'm going to be balding for real.
[149:30.70]Make your choice.
[149:31.36]Yeah, I don't even care.
[149:55.99]I don't even care.
[149:58.31]Said by the person that very much does.
[150:09.23]He's crying.
[150:11.76]I don't actually care.
[150:14.14]I'm very confident.
[150:16.34]I'm very confident in who I am.
[150:18.44]I'm, I'm who I am.
[150:20.98]I don't care.
[150:24.05]I'm super quick.
[150:25.85]I'm very, very... I can have explosive energy.
[150:29.28]I can fit in a lot of really... I can fit in a lot of spaces that normally, you know, a lot of big, tall people can't fit in.
[150:35.02]I don't give a shit.
[150:41.29]And... Eh, never mind.
[151:03.05]And what?
[151:03.99]And what?
[151:04.51]There is no and.
[151:05.53]20 minutes.
[151:24.14]Wow, this is relaxing.
[151:27.46]Hey, what's the point of this game?
[151:28.30]This would be... Nope.
[151:34.41]Oh, brand awareness.
[151:35.83]No, no.
[151:38.31]We're going to have a lot of fun.
[151:54.22]I can't wait to the first company meeting.
[151:58.11]Where me and Stans.
[152:00.90]I have a friend-ending argument and he throws a coffee in my face.
[152:22.03]No.
[152:24.65]We've already talked a bunch of times.
[152:27.56]And I think we're all kind of laser-focused on trying to be...
[152:31.05]Trying to make as good a stuff as we can and have fun doing it.
[152:37.24]The group is very much on the same page completely.
[152:56.84]Yep, I know I don't want to keep, you know, I mean, obviously I do want to keep reiterating it, but for people that weren't here at the beginning.
[153:03.20]Yeah, I am now officially an employee of off-brand.
[153:10.57]As the chief creative officer of the company.
[153:15.87]Can I keep going?
[153:22.15]Oh, I didn't get to roll up everything.
[153:37.03]Finally got a job.
[153:37.94]That's right.
[153:42.00]I'm looking forward to it.
[153:50.94]Yeah.
[153:51.46]Again, I'll make it clear.
[153:52.70]The role that I'm going to have in Off-Brand is to be essentially creative director of most of the stuff that comes through.
[154:00.40]So if you have a show and you want to do it through Off-Brand, we're probably going to talk extensively to develop out some of those things.
[154:13.33]So essentially, it's like a creative director of the company.
[154:27.44]That was fun.
[154:45.33]Are you gonna give ideas or just help other ideas happen?
[154:51.84]I think it's kind of gonna be everything.
[154:53.72]A little bit of everything.
[154:56.78]If I have something that I think I could add or that I want to do that I think would be great, maybe there's people that would want to do it.
[155:06.39]Help develop somebody else's idea.
[155:09.63]That sounds really fun to me.
[155:11.18]I would do that right up my alley.
[155:16.08]Land of Mystery Small Bang.
[155:22.92]And also working very closely with the production team.
[155:31.62]My responsibilities will probably develop a lot over the coming period.
[155:37.78]But I'm imagining it'll probably play out something like how I do it for my own shows.
[155:45.71]I write a bunch of stuff.
[155:48.09]I say, hey, I want it like this.
[155:49.63]I want it to be like that and like that.
[155:50.93]And it should be like this.
[155:51.79]And here's like the whole document of how I want it to go.
[155:55.52]And we take that to production.
[155:57.14]We see how it can fit in, go back and forth a lot.
[155:59.90]It's essentially just sort of the
[156:02.36]The... a lot of writing, a lot of kind of on-site direction I think too, which is what I like to do.
[156:12.26]That's where I hope to be.
[156:14.26]Are you just an ideas guy?
[156:19.34]No, no, I'm gonna be like on-site for a lot of these shows.
[156:23.48]And I'll be writing probably a very large portion of a lot of stuff that we're working on I imagine.
[156:30.66]So, no.
[156:31.98]But, I mean, it is that, too.
[156:33.92]It's kind of everything that you're describing.
[156:35.38]That I'm describing.
[156:43.51]Oh, he's a rider now.
[156:46.35]I can't ever tell anybody I'm a rider.
[156:47.97]I just can't.
[156:49.91]Because I'm not.
[156:55.15]Did I beat everything?
[157:00.87]I think we're done.
[157:04.01]He's gonna be an on-the-scene e-clown.
[157:06.13]I'm gonna walk over there and be like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on a second.
[157:11.78]That was... You need to say it with a little more oomph.
[157:14.32]A little more oomph.
[157:16.32]You need to squeeze your nose afterwards.
[157:20.80]Like, there's no... We don't have a clown nose in this scene.
[157:23.26]Why not?
[157:24.88]How could there not be a clown noise in every scene?
[157:36.19]Do you worry that you'll be so busy with projects that you'll run out of creative steam and won't be able to work on your own stuff?
[157:43.19]No, I don't think so.
[157:45.53]Because my own stuff at this point is going to probably be... is off-brand.
[157:50.31]That's a lot of the point, I think.
[157:59.64]You're only 45% finished?
[158:00.24]Uh...
[158:07.30]What do you got?
[158:09.36]What's this one again?
[158:15.06]They all have alternate versions, right?
[158:16.78]So it's just a change in focus in terms of where stuff like baseball stream will be coming from.
[158:38.04]I think it's both focus and sort of the evolution of where I really wanted to be.
[158:46.62]This is something I've always wanted to do.
[158:50.42]And I can continue to stream and still do this stuff.
[158:57.22]Working on a show and working on a project or something and doing all these things with off-brand is... It's going to take up a significant amount of time, but not all of my time.
[159:06.85]So I still can do this too.
[159:10.87]Sort of in an evolved way where I'm putting time here and putting time over there, putting time here.
[159:17.02]Because I genuinely love doing this.
[159:20.24]I love to stream.
[159:21.08]It's fun.
[159:21.76]It's a lot of fun.
[159:28.82]Uh, in the mod chat, there's a comment that says I need to respond to this.
[159:32.41]Okay.
[159:33.05]Jerma, will you ever have to for when you are going to in the future, will you be able to wanting to have that or no?
[159:40.31]I don't think so.
[159:41.99]I think, um, I think what matters is how I feel about, um, what you're describing.
[159:47.83]And I think how I feel about it is I feel like this is just the natural way that I would have done it anyways.
[159:57.13]What a really good question.
[159:59.31]What a really good comment.
[160:09.94]Use your left and right... Wait, this is the tutorial.
[160:16.48]Wait, how come I'm doing the tutorial again?
[160:18.46]Is there a reason why I'm here?
[160:29.91]That guy was the tutorial?
[160:37.58]I thought he had a different mission for me.
[160:53.36]Jeez.
[160:55.38]Oh, I want to do another car one.
[160:56.56]That sounds fun.
[161:02.14]I played this yesterday.
[161:03.96]It's a it's a good game.
[161:05.42]You can fly now beyond what you want to roll up cars.
[161:28.53]I've also talked to other streamers and YouTubers over the past year or two and just been like, you know, we should work together.
[161:33.79]We should do some stuff together.
[161:38.07]And now, I'm... This is my job now, is to do that.
[161:43.73]So I'm really hopeful and excited that anybody that I've really talked to over the years is like, hey, we should do something.
[161:52.33]Like, oh, yeah, we should.
[161:54.26]Okay, well, let's do it.
[161:55.60]Let's do something.
[162:02.64]because it's really easy to get into that mindset where oh yeah we'll do something yeah oh yeah and it's like I'm like I got my own going on and I I something else happened and yeah maybe some maybe well maybe one day yeah no wow let's do it let's do it
[162:30.20]My job here going forward is to make sure I follow up on those things.
[162:35.72]Because that's the point now.
[162:52.07]I want all those.
[162:55.03]Oh, this one.
[162:55.63]Oh, that's right.
[162:56.05]This one has all forward momentum.
[162:57.61]I can't stop.
[163:12.23]What is that sound?
[163:13.09]I want... There it is.
[163:18.15]He's your perfect cousin?
[163:32.93]Uhh...
[163:42.42]The ball.
[163:44.08]The tennis ball.
[163:47.04]I think I did pretty good there.
[163:58.71]2 minutes and 16 seconds.
[164:03.13]Yeah, Macho's pretty cool.
[164:13.86]Oh shit, that's right.
[164:14.44]I said, somebody's talking about, are you still eating Takis?
[164:17.01]I thought the Takis is what made me pee red.
[164:20.09]And I looked it up.
[164:22.13]It was the beets all along.
[164:27.24]Oh, they actually like it this time.
[164:30.28]You like it?
[164:33.22]Ooh.
[164:37.25]Got a good score.
[165:01.38]No more salad.
[165:04.52]What are we doing?
[165:05.12]The Final Fantasy 16 stuff?
[165:08.13]Um, just whenever.
[165:09.63]Whenever I feel like switching over to it.
[165:11.11]So it's just the demo.
[165:16.09]I think we're also going to watch one of the trailers for the game too.
[165:21.82]But I am actually... I'm very curious if I like this or not.
[165:28.78]Because Final Fantasy is, I never really got into very much Final Fantasy.
[165:31.92]By the way, Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross.
[165:34.93]Most important media in human history.
[165:36.45]It's up there.
[165:38.95]But Final Fantasy has been something I haven't really paid that much attention to for, I want to say, since Final Fantasy X?
[165:47.45]Final Fantasy VI or something?
[165:56.11]I'm going to do one more level and I'll switch over.
[166:04.04]Chrono Cross is mediocre.
[166:05.36]I agree.
[166:07.48]I agree.
[166:08.02]But I will tell you, Chrono Cross's soundtrack carries that entire game.
[166:20.85]The Chrono Cross soundtrack is so good that I can handle the kind of
[166:30.12]Kind of wild, kind of convoluted storyline.
[166:34.74]And don't put spoilers, please, because a lot of people don't know what I'm talking about.
[166:37.47]But if you know, you know.
[166:39.73]It's kind of messy.
[166:41.69]You needed to experience a text-based adventure game before playing Chrono Cross to get the actual story of how the game fucking worked.
[166:52.13]So there.
[166:54.47]Talk to that dog.
[166:57.74]I did before, didn't I?
[167:03.42]Another nice day.
[167:04.13]Didn't I already do the sun?
[167:11.39]Uh, but Chrono Cross's soundtrack carries the whole game.
[167:14.33]Except for the battle music.
[167:18.20]Which is unfortunate, because you hear the battle music more than anything else.
[167:24.92]You really rolled it up.
[167:25.94]You rolled up the sun, really and truly.
[167:27.99]Oh, we are impressed.
[167:29.77]We have a dog among our fans.
[167:31.73]One more time.
[167:32.59]One more time?
[167:34.47]I can't say no.
[167:38.08]Do it till the end.
[167:39.34]Do only this.
[167:40.48]The battle music's okay.
[167:51.52]It has no lasting power at all.
[167:53.68]I think it's just kind of the tempo is sort of out of whack with the game.
[168:05.24]It's just like that... Oh my god, I just scared the shit out of myself.
[168:11.86]I thought somebody was in my room.
[168:18.10]I was hitting my desk and something fell off the desk to the left and fell down.
[168:22.85]And I was like, oh shit, there's something in here.
[168:25.45]I thought there was an animal in my room.
[168:32.13]I'm sorry.
[168:37.59]That fucking sound from Devil May Cry, I swear, has permanently fucked me up.
[168:57.82]The prey instincts.
[169:00.12]Corn nuts?
[169:00.78]Yeah.
[169:09.14]But what I was trying to say is... This is too fast for battle music.
[169:18.33]This is too fast for battle music.
[169:20.47]Let's go to the other one.
[169:21.37]Let's go to Chrono Trigger.
[169:23.15]Ready?
[169:23.59]You hear the tempo?
[169:26.43]Here's that.
[169:27.46]You hear that, right?
[169:36.62]That's proper tempo.
[169:37.96]I think that Chrono Cross's tempo of... It's just like, eh, it's too slow down.
[169:44.61]Too much.
[169:44.87]There's a lot more planets here.
[170:10.00]What about Doom Eternal?
[170:11.21]Doom Eternal is not a turn-based RPG.
[170:18.54]Oh.
[170:18.72]What did I get?
[170:22.22]Mega and Altair?
[170:24.47]Those cousins?
[170:44.55]He doesn't know the stars.
[170:49.00]Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.
[170:56.62]Orion.
[171:01.05]Capricorn.
[171:01.63]Pisces.
[171:14.52]Big dipper.
[171:15.02]The little dipper.
[171:23.81]I'm a big fan of the little dipper, by the way.
[171:27.09]The little dipper is, you can see, I can make out the little dipper before anything else.
[171:33.75]What kind of food do you think they ate there?
[171:53.20]Did you watch the Starfield presentation?
[171:57.40]No.
[171:58.80]I have not seen a single clip from any of the summer game stuff.
[172:05.42]I don't even know what got announced.
[172:06.74]Yeah, I got everything right.
[172:15.41]I'm not going to pick up every single star.
[172:21.44]Elden Ring DLC trailer?
[172:22.84]No, no, sorry.
[172:23.80]I have an alert on my phone that will ping me the moment that happens.
[172:28.32]So, I'm sorry.
[172:29.38]I would have been the first person to tell you that.
[172:46.12]Every single morning I wake up and I just refresh the Elden Ring YouTube official page.
[172:52.31]At 6 a.m.
[173:08.97]But what if the announcement drops at 8 a.m.?
[173:12.07]Then I just won't see it till tomorrow.
[173:22.05]Alright, so now I will try not to lose in the credits.
[173:27.91]And then we'll move on.
[173:29.09]Just to give those of you that know, it's going to be a sponsor segment.
[173:31.89]We're going to chill.
[173:32.87]We're going to just hang out with the demo of Final Fantasy XVI.
[173:35.27]We're going to watch a trailer.
[173:36.97]And we're just going to fucking hang out.
[173:38.55]If you want to join us, please stick around.
[173:41.63]If you don't, then we'll see you at some point soon.
[173:44.19]Thanks for playing.
[173:45.23]Thanks for hanging out.
[173:46.25]Final Fantasy XVI.
[173:47.29]Coming up.
[173:51.41]Alright, I'm not going to get hit by the thing this time.
[174:02.28]Try the lies of P demo.
[174:04.56]I actually saw Charlie playing that for a little while.
[174:08.62]It actually looks fun.
[174:21.70]Is it actually good?
[174:22.54]It is good.
[174:27.22]I'll definitely try it.
[174:28.17]I mean, when does it come out?
[174:28.91]Maybe I won't play the demo.
[174:29.75]I'll probably just wait until it launches.
[174:34.09]Probably this summer, right?
[174:42.17]Yeah, September.
[174:42.69]I can wait.
[174:50.95]Okay, I have to be careful now.
[174:59.30]Everything is coming out in September, yeah.
[175:15.25]What about Trepang 2 when it launches?
[175:20.35]Oh, some of those Steam demo best things are coming out now, aren't they?
[175:25.50]OK, I'm not going to mess it up.
[175:28.02]I'm going to turn it up.
[175:49.21]I'm going to turn the volume up because it's like a big crescendo of the song.
[175:53.36]Here we go.
[176:03.91]Oh shit!
[176:26.70]oh every day
[177:02.83]Oh, no!
[177:04.22]I thought I was high enough.
[177:05.40]I was going to say, why is this character not in Smash Brothers?
[177:10.70]I thought there was room above.
[177:14.50]Alright.
[177:14.74]Well, we got at least the first verse.
[177:18.11]That's alright.
[177:26.37]We got through the first verse.
[177:31.43]Do better.
[177:38.47]Time to play Final Fantasy.
[177:41.23]Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy.
[177:45.25]Alright, let's move to Final Fantasy.
[177:46.60]It's been like three hours.
[177:48.18]This is what I kind of planned on.
[177:49.38]Stream in for like three-ish hours and then move to Final Fantasy.
[177:55.44]I'm going in.
[177:58.92]You look like Richard Lewis.
[178:03.55]Alright, cool.
[178:06.02]Cool.
[178:08.14]Hell yeah, that's kind of cool.
[178:16.62]Save the game?
[178:17.18]Yeah.
[178:27.27]No, I'm probably never going to play Cyberpunk.
[178:28.77]Cyberpunk.
[178:31.21]Alright, let me take a quick break.
[178:32.23]I will come back.
[178:32.93]We will start the Final Fantasy 16 hangout sesh.
[178:36.55]I'm going to watch the trailer first.
[178:40.95]And then we'll play it.
[178:44.97]So, again, this is going to be, we're going to slow it down.
[178:47.99]This is going to be kind of just a chill part of the stream.
[178:51.80]Because it is the demo.
[178:52.78]The demo is also available right now if you want to play it.
[178:59.59]I'll be right fucking back.
[179:06.33]Before I do.
[179:08.13]Let me just make sure this is ready.
[179:09.50]I'll check it real quick.
[179:15.38]Yep.
[179:16.88]Make sure this is good.
[179:17.84]Yep.
[179:19.92]Okay.
[179:24.35]Oh, by the way, I got a PS5 now.
[179:29.17]So that means also I can play the Demon's Souls Remaster remake.
[179:36.06]It only took me like two years to get one.
[179:42.06]So I'm excited about that.
[179:44.16]Alright, I'll be right back.
[179:46.70]I'm going to take me probably like a few minutes, maybe.
[179:49.20]I'm just going to set up a couple of things.
[179:50.60]There's a nightbot timer.
[179:52.62]Give me a minute.
[179:52.96]I'll be right back.
[179:54.15]Bye-bye.
