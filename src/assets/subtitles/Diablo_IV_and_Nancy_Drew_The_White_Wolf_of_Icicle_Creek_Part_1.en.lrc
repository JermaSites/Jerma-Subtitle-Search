[ve:60.16.100]

[00:37.40]Hello everyone.
[00:38.18]Hello, hi.
[00:41.86]He's alive.
[00:42.50]Yeah.
[00:46.57]Yeah.
[00:51.15]Welcome back.
[00:54.13]Been gone for a little while.
[00:54.85]Been a little busy, but you know.
[00:59.33]Those of you that saw the stream rewards, it was there.
[01:06.98]in Los Angeles oh he was in la it always feels like that's such a I don't know those of you that live in la you just live in la but those of us that visit la it's I went to la yeah I was in la cool but isn't that cool it's like a cool thing to go do for people that don't live there
[01:33.04]Anytime you tell somebody you were in LA, they go, really?
[01:35.78]Los Angeles, California.
[01:39.30]Yeah.
[01:40.79]Wow.
[01:41.91]Really?
[01:46.13]No one lives there.
[01:48.89]That would be weird considering it's one of the most populated cities in the entire country of the United States.
[01:55.04]That'd be interesting.
[01:56.50]What you said is true.
[02:06.60]But yeah, it was a great weekend.
[02:08.20]I took a little bit of time.
[02:11.05]I probably will take a little bit more time, if I'm honest with you.
[02:15.37]Not right now, obviously, but we'll go for the week.
[02:21.49]Yeah, I'm just turning the stream on just to be like, hey, what's up?
[02:23.65]And then I'm out of here.
[02:26.09]I'm kidding.
[02:26.73]Stop.
[02:28.51]Please address the goblin picture.
[02:32.45]I know there's a lot to address.
[02:38.15]I don't even... I kind of had one of those moments with the thing picture.
[02:48.55]And I was like, no, that's not real.
[02:51.57]That's not a real picture of a person.
[02:53.84]That's not a picture of me.
[02:59.66]But it is.
[03:03.23]Alright, let me just talk about the close-up Ren and Stimpy detailed SpongeBob picture.
[03:11.51]I've seen a lot of people, I've seen a lot of takes on it.
[03:14.73]The CEO rushing out of the courtroom with all the bodyguards trying to get into a limousine to avoid the interviews and the news cameras because of the scandal that they are involved in.
[03:26.96]I've heard it all.
[03:28.38]Seen many of them.
[03:38.44]But yeah, I don't take... Okay.
[03:41.51]You guys already know this.
[03:43.01]I don't take good pictures.
[03:45.61]I never have, and I never will.
[03:48.59]When a photo is taken of me, my face morphs into something else.
[03:55.32]It's not even my face anymore.
[03:58.60]Me on video versus me in pictures, it's almost like it's two completely different people.
[04:04.36]I've never gotten it.
[04:05.50]It doesn't make sense.
[04:10.65]You can't take a picture because it's his true form.
[04:12.79]He morphs.
[04:13.53]He doesn't want you to see his true form.
[04:14.95]You're literally Bigfoot.
[04:23.20]My face is really angular, too.
[04:25.10]Like, it just depends on what angle you take it from.
[04:27.12]You got a bunch of flash in the face, right?
[04:30.66]It's all good.
[04:31.08]I think it's funny that I'm here.
[04:41.99]I have a pointy face.
[04:43.03]Yeah, I kind of do.
[04:46.76]It doesn't also help that... I don't even know what I was... It almost sounds like I'm leaning... It looks like I'm leaning in.
[04:53.82]Pointing at my ear.
[04:56.68]Saying, could you say that again?
[04:58.34]Like I didn't hear what the person said?
[05:01.68]I don't know.
[05:02.24]But yeah, it was a good day.
[05:07.15]It was a good weekend.
[05:10.44]That legacy award is something I honestly had no idea was happening.
[05:16.32]It's kind of funny because
[05:19.26]I started to understand what was going on when the two camera guys started leaning down in front of the table we were sitting at and like rack focusing the camera directly in front of me like on my face like just right in front of me and I'm like this why is this person here this person is literally focusing like it's I can see them moving the the dial and they're right in front of me why are they here in front of me
[05:48.38]so it's really cool I I don't you know obviously there's a lot of people in the streaming world and in the content creation world that deserve that award I'm just surprised and shocked that it was me there's a lot of other people here I I wish I could tell you more I wish I could say more
[06:14.50]But people have been incredibly nice to me, incredibly supportive to me for a decade, more than that.
[06:22.59]And a lot of times I look at it and I kind of... I don't know, it's like, do I deserve it?
[06:28.63]I don't know.
[06:29.39]It's a weird feeling sometimes.
[06:34.40]But I really do hope that whoever's here, whether you started watching 10 years ago, 12 years ago, or you found the channel a month ago... Cool.
[06:44.89]I hope you'll like it.
[06:46.15]That's all I care about.
[06:50.99]Other streamers have come up and said a lot of really nice things.
[06:54.13]It was really... I just hope people like it.
[06:58.03]That's all I care about.
[06:59.73]And the thing about other streamers, too...
[07:02.98]There's a lot of really, really funny people.
[07:05.36]Really, really interesting people that do this.
[07:08.72]And I kind of want to make sure they understand that they are fucking awesome.
[07:14.44]There's lots of really cool people in this space.
[07:18.32]And although I don't get a lot of opportunity to tell them that, I hope I could this past weekend.
[07:42.89]I met people that I watch that say things to me about like how I'm awesome at what I do.
[07:53.84]But they are too.
[08:08.08]Dude, just cry already.
[08:09.65]I knew when I turned this, I was waiting to turn this stream, I was like, fuck, man, I'm going to talk about this and I'm going to cry.
[08:15.05]No, I'm good.
[08:18.64]But yeah, I want to make people aware that there's a lot of other people that do really interesting things, and I want them to know that too.
[08:25.96]Especially the people that I watch, that I have seen lots of their content before.
[08:30.49]And it's funny because people are almost surprised when they hear that I've seen some stuff that they do.
[08:35.31]Like, wait, what?
[08:36.31]How?
[08:36.67]You've never seen me?
[08:37.38]What are you talking about?
[08:38.04]Yeah, I have.
[08:39.56]And what you do is fucking cool.
[08:49.08]But anyways, it was a great weekend.
[08:53.40]He's always watching.
[09:01.63]Somebody said, you're the you do you guy.
[09:06.82]But it's true.
[09:07.68]There's a lot of people that should be recognized that are doing amazing things.
[09:22.33]It's time for a staring contest.
[09:31.91]Who is your successor?
[09:35.91]There is no successor.
[09:37.39]There are tons of people that are already doing their own thing very well.
[09:41.60]Nobody has to succeed me.
[09:43.60]I don't like that.
[09:45.48]That's a weird thing to think about.
[09:47.56]Yeah, I saw the Bill Clinton kid too.
[09:53.45]That was interesting.
[09:56.66]At first, I didn't know what was going on.
[09:57.90]I was really tired after the awards.
[10:00.75]And I was just kind of like, you know, had a couple of drinks.
[10:05.57]And he kind of leaned in.
[10:07.77]He was like, hey, he was trying to get me to talk into the camera.
[10:11.37]I think I was like, oh, yeah, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go and I'm going to get a massage.
[10:16.58]I was just saying words.
[10:17.94]I don't even know if they were.
[10:18.96]Like, what was I fucking talking about?
[10:30.69]Oh, is it vodka pineapple?
[10:31.91]Yeah.
[10:40.30]Vansley interview.
[10:42.88]That's right.
[10:43.60]I did.
[10:44.18]I did to like think of other things to talk about when I have nothing really to talk about.
[10:49.36]You know, the drink of choice is a vodka pineapple.
[10:52.42]Yeah, it's very clean.
[10:53.48]It's like, is there anything else you can talk?
[10:54.78]And the gorillas?
[10:56.18]Oh, yeah.
[10:56.84]Plastic Beach is my favorite album.
[11:00.32]Okay, dude.
[11:02.16]Do you have anything else to say to anybody?
[11:03.85]Yeah.
[11:13.91]We all have the things that we default to, I think.
[11:21.58]Plastic Beach?
[11:22.38]Really?
[11:23.32]Basic.
[11:25.34]I like Plastic Beach.
[11:26.24]I think Plastic Beach was... Hold on, don't say that.
[11:31.79]Easy.
[11:35.25]Don't say that.
[11:36.40]The Demon Days fans are going to be very upset with me.
[11:44.52]I think they're both equally fantastic albums.
[11:53.11]There you go.
[11:57.55]Yeah, there's not too much more to say.
[11:58.79]I'm just overwhelmed with the support that people give me.
[12:02.97]And I just hope it's worth it.
[12:06.64]I think about it every single day.
[12:09.68]How to improve stuff, how to be funnier, better.
[12:14.90]But I don't want to get too much in my own head, though, because I think that's where you get into trouble.
[12:19.62]Because I've told you this before, that I've got to be funnier.
[12:22.16]I've got to be better.
[12:22.88]I've got to be faster.
[12:23.74]I've got to be stronger.
[12:25.32]At some point, you end up flying into the sun.
[12:27.70]And I don't want to do that.
[12:28.34]Part of the reason for telling you guys that this year was going to be a little slower was because of that.
[12:38.89]And then some.
[12:41.69]So...
[12:44.03]Dude, just keep doing you.
[12:45.67]Exactly.
[12:46.99]Exactly.
[12:47.85]You get it.
[12:52.97]I mean it, though.
[12:53.55]I really do.
[12:54.27]I really do.
[12:54.77]I promise.
[12:57.18]You do.
[12:57.84]Hey, I'm telling you.
[12:58.48]That's true.
[12:59.24]There's been people that have been here for a decade.
[13:09.37]And...
[13:12.09]I don't know.
[13:13.55]It's hard to put into words.
[13:14.59]It's overwhelming.
[13:15.19]And that's why I pull out a lot.
[13:17.71]That's why I disconnect so often.
[13:19.13]Because I need to.
[13:22.22]I don't want to get too overwhelmed that I end up... Alright.
[13:28.56]I pulled back from the internet.
[13:30.42]Alright.
[13:30.68]That's what I was trying to say.
[13:31.38]I pull out from the internet.
[13:32.58]I can't... Come on.
[13:35.47]Come on.
[13:35.81]Come on.
[13:36.11]Excuse me.
[13:41.53]What if I just turn the camera on, which is bawling for 10 straight minutes.
[13:52.54]Would people think that would be weird?
[13:57.12]And I just, I put, I like have the, I'm holding the trophy.
[14:01.39]I'm holding the award.
[14:02.41]It's just crying.
[14:04.35]What if that's how I started the stream?
[14:06.51]And then I moved on after about 20 straight minutes.
[14:11.23]And then I get, like, I get, like, I look at it, I, like, start to... I look in the reflection in it and stuff, and I just sit there and I turn it so you can see me looking in the reflection into the metal.
[14:24.76]Would people leave the channel?
[14:26.40]Would you leave?
[14:26.98]Would you be like, alright, this is fucking weird, I'm leaving.
[14:29.52]This guy's a weirdo.
[14:31.84]I don't want to really be here anymore.
[14:35.49]How long into the 20 minute cry with the award in my hands bit before you leave the stream?
[14:49.61]Four hours.
[14:50.42]Oh my God.
[14:54.24]Alright, we can move on.
[14:54.98]I just wanted to talk a little bit briefly about streamer awards.
[14:57.54]There's a lot of awesome people in this industry and I like telling people that because I genuinely watch a lot of different people.
[15:05.91]And I'm shocked that this many people think that I'm cool enough or nice enough or interesting enough to even decide that that's something that I should have received.
[15:15.31]Shocked and floored and thank you everybody that's been here for this long.
[15:18.65]Even if you don't like it.
[15:19.73]Even if you fucking came here and you're like, this guy sucks.
[15:21.72]This guy's not funny.
[15:23.84]Thanks for checking me out in the first place.
[15:25.02]I appreciate it.
[15:27.44]Thank you.
[15:27.74]So now we're going to play Diablo 4 if we can and not get booted in 10 minutes from the server.
[15:41.48]We have a contingency plan.
[15:43.12]If Diablo 4 does not work, if I get booted and can't play it, some of you are going to be really excited over this.
[15:51.79]And I don't even know if I want to say it because I feel like it's going to derail the entire stream.
[15:56.95]And I'm just going to play D4.
[16:00.20]But I do have to tell you about the contingency plan.
[16:03.40]um if we do get booted and there's like a 60 minute wait time I'm gonna go back into the queue and we're gonna play Nancy Drew mystery of the icicle wolf in between in the downtime
[16:27.97]By the way, I don't even know if I can capture that game.
[16:30.05]I tried to three or four times and it was kind of a mess, but I got it to work very briefly.
[16:34.23]So we'll see if it works.
[16:36.07]We're going to hit downtime in the Diablo 4 server, and it's going to take me 40 minutes to capture this Nancy Drew game.
[16:43.24]So it might not even be worth it at all.
[16:45.90]We're also going to talk about Grotto Beasts a little bit later.
[16:50.47]There's a couple of little things to kind of show you or to let you know exist.
[16:55.54]Some stuff that, something people have been waiting for.
[16:57.26]So that's cool.
[17:00.48]And I think it's time to play.
[17:02.48]I don't want to say I'm excited for Diablo 4, because I told you a week or two ago when this was a thing, that I don't want to be excited for this, because I refuse to be excited over a game like this, because my entire life revolved around Diablo II.
[17:17.10]And Diablo 3 was like, eh, it was alright.
[17:22.60]They made a bunch of improvements to it over the years, but it just wasn't it.
[17:29.86]Diablo Immortal came out.
[17:30.98]I thought it was... awful.
[17:36.13]So, Diablo 4 comes out.
[17:38.31]Awful.
[17:39.55]So let- I'm ju- I have zero- We're going in with zero expectations.
[17:43.05]Zero.
[17:46.84]I'm- I ju- I'm- I- I- Here we are.
[17:49.50]Okay, ready?
[17:52.76]character creator.
[17:53.90]I wanted to make sure I was in the game, so I had to kind of get into the character creator because there was a 70-plus minute wait to get in here.
[18:01.60]Um... Yeah, I wanted to name the character Internal Temp, uh, 145 degrees.
[18:08.59]But, yeah, it's like, oh, yeah, like a fire character.
[18:10.57]I don't know.
[18:11.01]I mean, this is sorceress.
[18:13.67]We're just gonna go with Internal Temp.
[18:15.65]We've probably already seen the cutscene before.
[18:17.25]You've probably already seen it.
[18:18.27]If you haven't, then, I mean, it's probably on YouTube.
[18:24.61]145 degrees.
[18:25.94]That's meat, right?
[18:27.12]Internal temperature of 145.
[18:28.32]Is that accurate?
[18:30.12]Or is it 160?
[18:31.14]165?
[18:31.22]Give him a real name.
[18:35.96]This character is going to get deleted probably in three days.
[18:39.75]What do you mean it needs to be a real name?
[18:44.07]This guy is getting deleted.
[18:46.01]Probably.
[18:47.73]It's 145, isn't it?
[18:50.09]Alright, let's go.
[18:51.14]I am not excited.
[18:53.66]Don't get excited.
[18:55.86]Just let's start at zero.
[18:56.96]Here we go.
[18:57.82]You ready?
[19:05.30]It's this one, right?
[19:06.74]World tier?
[19:08.40]Okay, this is like normal nightmare hell, I'm imagining.
[19:14.77]Enemies are more challenging, monsters give more experience.
[19:16.45]Yeah, I mean, we're doing this one.
[19:19.30]Hey, here we go.
[19:20.15]I'm not.
[19:23.17]I'm don't get excited.
[19:24.05]Whatever.
[19:36.06]Sanctuary was never meant for humankind.
[19:39.46]It was forged as a refuge from the war between the high heavens and the burning hells.
[19:48.13]Instead, it became a new battleground in this eternal conflict.
[19:54.69]A secretive group called the Haradrim has kept mortals safe.
[20:01.27]But now this once powerful order is a husk of what it was.
[20:07.02]And Sanctuary's ancient creators have returned to claim the hearts of humankind.
[20:13.16]Alright.
[20:15.30]This is the story of their downfall.
[20:32.75]Is Deckard Cain in this game?
[20:33.91]Tell me!
[20:34.37]Is Deckard Cain in the game?
[20:51.50]I just jumpscared a shitload of people.
[20:53.62]I'm sorry.
[21:04.07]It's a cutscene.
[21:04.69]What am I even doing here?
[21:08.67]Deckard Cain.
[21:10.19]If you didn't play Diablo 3, let me tell you something.
[21:11.93]Deckard Cain.
[21:13.10]Something happens to him in the third game.
[21:18.50]What was that?
[21:22.86]Internal temp?
[21:24.24]Oh, that's me.
[21:25.48]That's not my computer.
[21:29.79]I thought it was telling me my computer was overheating.
[21:39.11]How did I forget that already?
[21:40.32]I need to drink some fucking water.
[21:41.81]Jesus.
[22:09.82]Alright, what are the controls?
[22:34.32]I am so excited.
[22:35.28]I don't even care if this game sucks or whatever.
[22:38.32]I'm here.
[22:43.84]I just want to collect loot on the ground and have it go, wickle, wickle, wickle, wickle, ping.
[22:51.09]His internal temperature is way too low.
[22:54.33]True.
[23:12.72]The only dialog we've had this whole cutscene has been gasping and heavy breathing.
[23:21.34]I should find better shelter before I freeze.
[23:28.62]OK.
[23:28.86]Hold on, I'm going to give you my initial assessment here.
[23:31.68]How far can I pull the camera out?
[23:33.58]OK.
[23:42.06]Melee range is very big.
[23:45.90]Gold.
[23:50.11]Okay.
[23:52.17]I find shelter in a nearby town.
[23:53.77]Okay, let's go.
[23:57.51]So I'm a sorcerer.
[24:02.91]Melee range is... Oh, it's not melee.
[24:05.13]I get it.
[24:07.97]It's like a little... What is this?
[24:11.78]Oh, that's just attack.
[24:16.50]You're going to do face cam?
[24:19.74]I'm only doing face cam for like the first 10 minutes.
[24:24.12]Just game viewership and then it's gone off.
[24:26.52]Hold, okay.
[24:27.74]Do I have to hold alt?
[24:41.69]I'll tell you my initial reactions to the one swing, the few swings on enemies and stuff.
[24:49.70]I love it.
[24:51.04]Well, hold on.
[24:51.50]No, no, no.
[24:51.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:52.42]That was a weird way to say that.
[24:56.34]So one thing that they added in this game that I don't know if you could turn it off in Diablo 3.
[25:00.06]You're probably noticing that every time I attack an enemy, they don't light up like a Christmas tree.
[25:09.59]I'm so glad that I can turn that off.
[25:13.42]I don't know why we had decided to put that in games.
[25:16.78]Like, let me... I'm so glad I can just turn it off.
[25:19.22]I hate that so much.
[25:20.60]Keep it on?
[25:26.40]No.
[25:27.40]And there's no screen shake either.
[25:28.58]I turned that off too.
[25:29.80]Is it audio?
[25:30.42]Is it too loud?
[25:34.56]I think it's a little too loud.
[25:35.78]Hold on.
[25:48.76]What's going on here?
[25:49.42]Interesting.
[25:50.06]Turn it up.
[26:19.03]It was okay?
[26:19.65]Okay, I'll put it up a little higher.
[26:23.93]Ooh, alright.
[26:25.07]In this game, it's like MMO, kind of.
[26:28.75]It's like MMO... It's like MMO internal temperature here, right?
[26:33.08]Okay.
[26:33.26]Wait, I'm going to slow down.
[26:50.56]Alright, that's the heel.
[26:53.04]If Devmir is taking up all the space by the fire, just give him a shove.
[27:00.56]What's that?
[27:01.80]You see something?
[27:02.76]Okay.
[27:04.12]Fire is looking good, but I should watch it a little longer to make sure it doesn't go out.
[27:12.22]Alright.
[27:12.74]Could you protect us from whatever is out there?
[27:16.34]We have nowhere else to turn.
[27:20.33]Kill rats in the basement?
[27:21.31]You got it.
[27:25.49]Are you wearing a periodic table?
[27:39.44]Oh, this is embarrassing.
[27:44.16]Because this is a periodic table of all the Star Wars characters that's ever existed.
[27:52.94]I don't know why I own all these shirts.
[27:56.95]I don't know why I have all these.
[27:58.81]I think they were... I think most of them were gifts.
[28:12.03]That's a shirt for a 12-year-old.
[28:14.07]It's just... You know, maybe one day I'm going to give all these Star Wars shirts to somebody.
[28:24.64]Is it going to kill me?
[28:35.10]Gold.
[28:36.58]Oh, it's heals.
[28:37.76]Okay, Q is an instant heal.
[28:42.18]And then it's a heal over time.
[28:43.34]That's interesting.
[28:48.42]Didn't I level up?
[28:49.10]Hold on.
[28:52.76]I leveled up, didn't I?
[28:58.35]Alright, I want to compare.
[28:59.05]Oh, I don't even have gloves on.
[29:00.17]Alright, what abilities?
[29:08.68]On Earth?
[29:09.22]Okay, hold on a second.
[29:11.86]So this is the skill tree.
[29:13.22]Guys, I have not looked at anything of this game.
[29:16.36]I know absolutely nothing.
[29:18.46]I saw like two or three little videos just kind of describing the game as it sort of turned into what it is today.
[29:25.44]But I've deliberately avoided almost everything.
[29:29.62]So it looks like it's a big... So you start up here, and then you can go down this way, and then this way, and then this way, and then this way, and then this way, and then this... Down here.
[29:38.41]Okay.
[29:40.29]Well, what can I do?
[29:41.99]Spark.
[29:44.17]Is that what I have right now?
[29:45.21]No.
[29:46.69]Launch a bolt of lightning that shocks an enemy four times.
[29:50.99]Frostbolt.
[29:55.83]firebolt it's kind of like the character's name is internal temp makes sense for me to have this flaming and it's a burn and arc lash what do you think should I go let us pick okay what do I do let us choose yeah that's fine thematically it does kind of have to be firebolt but I'll let you decide spark frostbolt firebolt or arc lash let's go pull up two minutes less than two minutes
[30:24.82]Unleash arcing lightning that does 13 damage to enemies in front of you.
[30:27.30]Every 10 times arc lash swipes, it stuns all enemies.
[30:30.60]Why does this seem like the best thing here?
[30:43.62]It is the best one.
[30:45.48]Yeah, but do we want to... I don't want to do the thing... Wait a minute.
[30:47.86]I might veto this.
[30:49.11]Does every sorceress that you've seen on Twitch pick this?
[30:52.51]Because I want to... I don't know.
[30:53.37]I want to do something different.
[31:00.90]Enhance spark.
[31:01.68]2% crit strike.
[31:04.90]You're going to make the worst character.
[31:12.29]Why are you such a hipster?
[31:14.85]I'm not.
[31:15.27]I just don't know.
[31:16.03]It's a beta.
[31:16.61]I want to be able to showcase the other stuff.
[31:23.41]What about down here?
[31:23.95]Incinerate.
[31:27.15]Are these out of 5?
[31:29.51]Or are these just 3 points?
[31:32.57]So what, it would be 8 points to max it out?
[31:38.54]Those are 1, okay.
[31:40.38]What is the cap?
[31:41.64]50?
[31:41.82]Level 50 is the cap.
[31:42.78]So you realistically... Realistically, you really only could be able to at level 50...
[31:52.89]Only get a handful of these, right?
[31:55.63]Interesting.
[31:56.07]Okay.
[31:56.57]So you really have to kind of decide.
[31:59.11]We want fire.
[31:59.63]What is it at right now?
[32:00.25]Alright.
[32:02.01]We'll go with fire.
[32:03.29]That's what I would have picked anyways.
[32:04.18]Alright.
[32:05.38]Fire bolt.
[32:07.62]Here it is.
[32:07.96]Cool.
[32:09.62]So this is now here, but I want it here.
[32:12.24]Oh, it's locked.
[32:12.76]Okay.
[32:16.04]Ooh.
[32:16.86]How much mana does it use?
[32:33.74]So Nancy Drew is a game that we're going to be checking out today.
[32:36.42]Diablo 4 happens to be not functioning as we have intended.
[32:41.10]Nancy Drew is going to be the game that we are going to be taking a look at today.
[32:49.37]God damn it.
[32:50.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[32:51.05]Hold on.
[32:51.27]I think I'm still in.
[32:53.59]Am I still good?
[32:54.19]Wait, I think I'm still good.
[33:04.46]I wanted to play Diablo 4.
[33:05.60]What's that mean?
[33:21.11]Just restart the game?
[33:26.35]Okay.
[33:26.99]Restart the game?
[33:27.77]Won't I have to go back into the cube for like a fucking hour?
[33:38.23]Don't restart, people are saying.
[33:45.61]I unlocked one move and now I can't play anymore.
[33:53.76]Shit.
[33:54.04]It says restart.
[34:00.00]You need to restart.
[34:07.83]You're playing day one?
[34:10.37]Well, I mean day one of two days for a beta.
[34:15.66]It's not... It's day one of two.
[34:23.24]Or three.
[34:24.18]Day one of three.
[34:26.09]Okay.
[34:28.75]I'm going to just restart it and see how long it takes to get back in.
[34:31.31]And then I'm going to play Nancy Drew.
[34:38.24]Three days next weekend?
[34:39.54]Yeah.
[34:40.76]Still.
[34:41.04]Alright, let's try it.
[34:47.87]I'm hoping for, like, less than five minutes.
[34:49.59]That was just getting good.
[34:59.13]That felt, like, that felt good from what I was walking around.
[35:06.11]Alright, what's the queue?
[35:07.77]Ooh, we got a queue of only nine minutes!
[35:18.10]Let's open up Nancy Drew.
[35:19.12]Might as well just get it open.
[35:51.24]Uh, here's one big problem.
[35:53.68]This game was made in like, I don't know, like 1996 or something.
[36:01.41]Um, so I don't even know if I can, can you see this?
[36:03.55]Hi, I'm Nancy Drew.
[36:04.65]Since you can tell a lot about a person by where he or she lives, I thought I'd introduce myself by showing you my room.
[36:10.70]As you can see, I keep it pretty neat.
[36:12.92]Of course, I don't spend that much time in here.
[36:15.08]I always seem to be off solving mysteries.
[36:17.68]Anyway, here's...
[36:19.41]Yes, you can.
[36:20.01]Don't lie to me right now.
[36:21.26]I can't alt tab.
[36:22.48]Don't lie.
[36:23.42]Stop lying.
[36:25.72]My desk.
[36:26.72]Go ahead and poke around.
[36:28.36]If you want to know the particulars of how I do what I do, take a look at the book titled How to Be a Detective.
[36:34.26]It's real helpful, especially if you're new to the mystery solving business.
[36:38.05]This is Nancy Drew and the history and the mystery of the wolf in the icicle cave or something.
[36:41.99]I don't say anything about it.
[36:52.82]Head to the Icicle Creek Lodge, a small guest lodge deep in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta, Canada, and try to figure out why so many accidents have been happening there.
[37:01.75]The woman who runs the lodge, Chantal Moit, called me out the blue, saying that I can't even read fucking English words.
[37:11.97]From Shadow Ranch, it's recommended.
[37:15.00]I'm so flustered right now.
[37:17.30]She sounds so desperate that I couldn't refuse.
[37:20.14]It's something with the way the words are blurry, and I can't read them.
[37:23.38]She said she was on her way to Edmonton to meet with her lawyers, so her handyman, Ollie Randall, will pick me up at the airport.
[37:31.87]She told me it's been really cold and snowy there, and that I should pack accordingly.
[37:36.77]And then she said something about a wolf.
[37:38.63]The connection was getting really bad, and I could barely hear her.
[37:41.39]But I'm pretty sure she used the word prowling, or was it howling, along with dangerous and be careful.
[37:48.26]Couldn't you have just said, she told me to be careful of the howling and it might be dangerous?
[37:53.06]Why do you have to do all this weird prowling, howling, dangerous, and be careful?
[37:59.02]She just said one sentence to you.
[38:00.98]Like, why do you have to break it up like this?
[38:05.08]Okay, but wild animals?
[38:06.38]I hope I know what I'm getting into.
[38:07.56]Okay.
[38:10.40]How do I do it?
[38:11.76]I just fucking exited the goddamn game.
[38:14.20]No, I didn't.
[38:14.54]Thank God.
[38:18.00]okay oh there it is so get on the uh get on the plane the junior level provides a lot of help and hints most more experienced players may enjoy playing the senior level
[38:47.59]I don't want to click this because it makes me feel old.
[38:50.11]I don't want to click this because it's going to be like two +2 equals four.
[39:00.53]When Chantal told me you were just a young thing, I thought she was pulling my leg.
[39:04.50]But you're not much older than my little girl, Freddie.
[39:07.34]Well, if one of the people at the lodge is to blame for all those accidents, Chantal thinks somebody like me has a better chance of figuring out who it is than somebody more, you know, hard-nosed.
[39:17.53]Chantal has a bad habit of making up her mind without thinking things clear through.
[39:22.75]No need for you to tell her I said that.
[39:24.11]Look at the road, dude.
[39:25.61]Is she still in Edmonton?
[39:26.79]Afraid so.
[39:28.47]Insurance company's giving her and her lawyers a real hard time.
[39:32.08]Left running the lodge up to me.
[39:34.26]Which is why I'm not real crazy.
[39:36.40]Oh my god!
[39:38.62]Especially if something else happens.
[39:40.78]I won't be underfoot, Mr. Randall.
[39:42.84]And I may be young, but I'm no novice when it comes to solving mysteries.
[39:46.56]I'm sorry.
[39:48.01]If you look over at somebody in the passenger seat, one, two, three, four, that's the car spinning.
[39:55.85]What actually happened there?
[39:57.30]Was anyone in the bunkhouse when it exploded?
[39:59.96]No, ma'am.
[40:00.50]Everyone here at the lodge is accounted for.
[40:17.86]had been living.
[40:18.48]Guess it was a good thing they quit after all.
[40:21.50]Elsa was my maid and Becky was my cook.
[40:24.04]Does the sheriff have any idea why the bunkhouse exploded?
[40:27.50]He said he'd know more after the lab was done running tests on the debris he'd collected.
[40:31.52]He did say the blast was pretty powerful.
[40:33.74]Any slide puzzles available?
[40:34.68]One of his deputies found a knob to the back door clear out on the highway.
[40:37.88]Oh, that does it.
[40:39.48]Nancy, you have to find out who or what is behind these incidents and you have to do it fast.
[40:45.08]You sure you don't want to give your daddy a call?
[40:49.10]runs a whole chain of resorts ollie if you think I'm gonna admit to him that I can't handle running just one guess again besides Nancy comes highly recommended and I'm sure she's got a foolproof plan for getting to the bottom of this don't you Nancy well I was thinking that maybe I'd just be your new maid you want to be my maid how's the audio give me access to everyone's room and I could question people without making them overly suspicious
[41:19.04]That's an excellent idea.
[41:20.52]Alright.
[41:22.20]You're my new maid.
[41:23.66]In fact, you're my new cook, too.
[41:25.78]The phone's not connected to anything.
[41:27.28]Your cook?
[41:27.96]Well, that way, Ollie can stop pretending he can even read a recipe, let alone follow one.
[41:32.84]You'll have even more excuses to talk to the guests, and I won't have to pay anyone.
[41:36.93]Well, I think that's a fine idea, ma'am.
[41:39.61]Now, we're not taking any more guests until this accident thing is cleared up.
[41:43.39]So I want both of you to make sure that the four guests we have are well taken care of.
[41:48.02]Sounds like Stirr doing one of his voices.
[41:49.30]Are we alright?
[42:10.82]Oh, and Nancy, I want you to call this police detective I've hired as a consultant.
[42:16.02]I put his number on the phone there at the lodge.
[42:18.94]In fact, I think you know him.
[42:21.30]Tino Balducci?
[42:23.57]I gotta go.
[42:24.19]My lawyer's here.
[42:25.27]Good luck, you guys, and keep me posted.
[42:27.95]Coming!
[42:29.45]Tino Balducci.
[42:31.19]Okay.
[42:32.63]I'll get you a master key and leave it in your room.
[42:35.47]If you need anything else, I'll be in the basement.
[42:37.84]It's Ster's wolf voice from when we played that game.
[42:40.78]It's the only thing I can hear.
[42:42.06]Okay.
[42:48.05]Mystery.
[42:48.89]What's this?
[42:50.99]Tea?
[42:52.58]What's this?
[42:54.32]What's that?
[42:54.82]What's this?
[42:56.16]What's that?
[42:57.28]What's this?
[42:59.52]What's that?
[42:59.80]What is this?
[43:01.48]What's this thing?
[43:02.14]What's that?
[43:03.36]What's that?
[43:03.64]There's a key inside of that.
[43:04.60]Open that key here.
[43:05.30]Got it.
[43:05.52]Okay.
[43:05.64]Alright, we got a clock here.
[43:06.56]It's 9... I can read it.
[43:07.16]It's 9.15.
[43:29.52]We don't have any information for this yet.
[43:30.84]What's this?
[43:36.14]Daily cleaning.
[43:36.90]Pick up laundry bag at the front desk.
[43:40.67]Available after 545 AM.
[43:43.25]Enter and clean only those rooms displaying the housekeeping sign.
[43:46.35]Make the bed.
[43:46.89]Wait.
[43:49.56]I actually have to do it.
[43:50.44]I thought I was just pretending to be the maid.
[43:54.16]I don't actually have to do this, do I?
[43:58.39]Did you do pond maintenance?
[44:03.25]I thought that I was just... I thought part of this routine was that I was going to pretend to be the maid so I could go in and question people.
[44:13.92]Alright, whatever.
[44:16.08]Okay.
[44:17.02]Pawn must be shoveled out after every snowfall.
[44:20.28]Some sections of ice will be very thin due to hot spring activity.
[44:23.64]Pay close attention to the color of the ice and only shovel off those areas which are safe to skate on.
[44:30.68]The shade of the ice will reveal how many adjacent ice grids have dangerously thin ice.
[44:36.50]Mark these areas with an orange safety cone.
[44:39.41]Okay, so we don't want to... This is bad.
[44:44.01]So at what point is it safe to skate on?
[44:45.77]Oh my goodness.
[44:51.71]Diablo is still... I have authentication pending.
[44:56.05]I don't think we're getting it anytime soon.
[45:03.49]This color means that there are three patches of... It's Minesweeper.
[45:06.77]Report all avalanches to the avalanche patrol
[45:17.22]Do not make loud noises when in the backcountry.
[45:20.84]Wear snowshoes.
[45:21.86]Can you imagine if this is what a clock sounded like?
[45:25.92]This thing would be smashed in a second if it was near me for more than a minute.
[45:33.99]Report any criminal activity.
[45:38.65]Okay.
[45:39.67]I can't even think when that's in my ears.
[45:41.77]Employees should remember that heat and moisture sometimes cause the door to the sauna to stick.
[45:46.11]Check to make sure.
[45:46.59]Is this giving me all the solutions to the puzzles?
[45:52.90]This is puzzle solutions.
[45:58.12]Breakfast is served from 7 to 8.
[46:00.22]Lunch from noon to 1.
[46:01.38]Dinner from 6 to 7.
[46:02.24]Okay.
[46:03.60]Okay.
[46:22.30]I think I just crashed my computer.
[46:34.19]Okay.
[46:45.12]Alright.
[47:06.03]Wow now this is very loud now Don't worry guys.
[47:12.87]I'm gonna kill three more skeletons, and we'll play Nancy Drew again Ocean charges, that's right, okay You can only have up to four
[47:34.13]Got it.
[47:34.37]Let me just check over here.
[47:36.97]What is A?
[47:38.43]Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
[47:41.01]Whoa!
[47:45.23]Guys, Nancy Drew is still open in the background.
[47:47.71]That clock is ticking into Nancy Drew's AI brain.
[47:52.54]And she just has to sit there.
[47:59.38]It's still open.
[48:00.14]Oh, don't worry.
[48:00.54]It's open.
[48:01.00]I'm making sure.
[48:02.40]I'm prepared now.
[48:05.53]Um, I think I'm just gonna do that one in here.
[48:08.42]Yeah.
[48:10.90]How many points to get?
[48:11.86]Oh, I already can.
[48:12.50]Alright, I think I'm just gonna be a weirdo and just do this five times.
[48:28.80]Doesn't Nancy Drew have a day-night cycle?
[48:31.20]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if we go back over there.
[48:34.63]It's like 12 days have passed.
[48:39.07]Just staring at the clock.
[48:43.59]What a miserable fucking life Nancy Drew has right now.
[48:46.96]I'm so sorry, Nancy.
[48:52.40]He's better?
[48:52.76]Yeah.
[49:02.88]She's stuck in purgatory.
[49:04.14]Actually, it is kind of loud, isn't it?
[49:10.89]Just a little.
[49:11.35]Just a little bit.
[49:12.05]Just a little.
[49:20.22]Chest.
[49:21.70]Oh, uniques.
[49:22.62]Uniques.
[49:26.58]Okay, so search the depths of Ice Howl ruins.
[49:29.23]The games are blending together for me.
[49:30.71]I feel like I'm in Nancy Drew.
[49:31.87]I feel like I am Nancy Drew right now.
[49:35.13]Ice Howl, wolf, icy.
[49:36.96]It's like the same thing.
[49:43.26]Guys, just pretend that we went to go investigate the wolf.
[49:58.26]It does feel pretty fun to play so far, but let's not say that yet.
[50:05.39]The first 10 minutes of Diablo 3 were fun too.
[50:08.35]Were they?
[50:10.07]Yeah, they were.
[50:10.93]I would be lying if I didn't say that they weren't.
[50:23.67]It definitely feels a little slower than D3.
[50:29.21]Which is a good thing.
[50:49.68]They really took it in a new direction.
[50:55.16]It's like a dodge roll?
[50:59.20]Oh, shit.
[50:59.54]Hold on.
[50:59.76]This is like a... What?
[51:09.52]Demons.
[51:10.01]Cool.
[51:21.75]Oh, that original sound.
[51:24.27]Wait, I want to check over here.
[51:45.15]Where's the loot?
[51:45.55]Where's the items?
[51:50.25]This is pretty much Roblox gameplay.
[51:52.59]It is not Roblox gameplay.
[52:03.40]Cool.
[52:03.58]Actually, I'll just take it.
[52:07.90]So true.
[52:19.70]I do like the fire.
[52:25.98]How much time?
[52:26.72]Oh, it's five seconds, okay.
[52:36.29]I need some splash damage or something.
[52:47.46]Oh shit.
[52:49.71]First blue ever in D4.
[52:56.21]So what is the itemization like?
[52:57.37]What does it look like?
[52:58.03]36 armor, 4 decks.
[53:01.24]Okay.
[53:05.56]He's better than I have.
[53:10.71]Item power.
[53:11.47]Okay.
[53:13.15]Okay.
[53:15.73]Take Arc, Last Jerma.
[53:17.53]It should help with mobs.
[53:21.02]Hold on a second here.
[53:21.92]I have a lot of choices here now.
[53:35.57]Incinerate.
[53:40.69]Is this a flamethrower?
[53:54.12]So this is kind of better than this.
[53:55.95]But this has a damage on it.
[53:58.03]Refund.
[54:01.81]Because Fireball is better than Firebolt.
[54:03.67]I think Firebolt, maybe with the damage over time, is good.
[54:10.07]Is Nancy alright?
[54:11.43]I think Nancy's alright.
[54:15.91]Don't stack Bolt.
[54:18.80]So this is 19.
[54:19.14]This is...
[54:24.14]17.
[54:24.24]And 14 of it is over 8 seconds.
[54:29.52]So I definitely want to go for... Wait, what about the other ones?
[54:31.68]Frozen Orb?
[54:32.30]Nah, I don't think so.
[54:36.55]That's not bad.
[54:37.37]I don't need it right now, though.
[54:38.45]Alright, we'll go Fireball.
[54:40.75]And then, should I refund this?
[54:46.09]I don't think I can.
[54:51.28]So now I can go... But it probably costs a lot of mana, though.
[54:53.92]Alright, that's why you do... I get it.
[54:57.28]Alright, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[54:58.24]Let's go.
[54:58.57]I get it.
[55:10.14]Only if you have no mana.
[55:11.20]Yep.
[55:11.34]That's a good way to put it.
[55:18.08]Alright, I understand.
[55:22.90]I get the rotation.
[55:23.62]It's a good sound effect.
[55:30.29]I do appreciate this for dummies like me that walk in circles and forget where I just was.
[55:38.35]I do appreciate that.
[55:46.72]Lightning resistance.
[55:50.08]Where are my... Oh, here we go.
[55:53.96]Oh, these are materials.
[55:59.05]Strength.
[55:59.41]Okay, hold on.
[56:03.23]So resistances are in the game.
[56:05.55]That's cool to know.
[56:30.88]Check on Nancy.
[56:31.48]I will, I promise.
[56:36.31]We just open up the other game and she's just screaming.
[56:47.29]Alright, where?
[56:50.87]Okay, I've been over here.
[56:52.17]This way.
[56:55.88]Dude, she's wolf food now.
[57:07.16]Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.
[57:11.41]I'm low on precious metals.
[57:15.51]Cool.
[57:20.77]Start a Nancy timer.
[57:23.73]No, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[57:40.46]I can do that two times before I have to do it again.
[57:45.16]Are there mana potions?
[57:46.33]Probably, right?
[58:00.41]It's so funny because I knew showing Nancy Drew was just going to be, that was a bad idea.
[58:07.83]Because now everyone knows that she's just sitting there looking at the clock.
[58:22.19]I am curious, though, because I really do wonder if there's a time limit on that game.
[58:26.35]That's going to be very funny, too.
[58:27.65]So let's see how it plays out.
[58:35.48]What is this button?
[58:40.89]What do you want?
[59:00.03]I'll tell you, this is fun.
[59:04.02]This is fun to play.
[59:09.44]This is a thousand times better than Diablo Immortal.
[59:12.46]I mean a hundred million times.
[59:14.32]I lack limited mana.
[59:30.12]I'm not excited yet.
[59:31.96]Don't get excited.
[59:34.48]You haven't played Diablo in a while.
[59:35.92]That's why it's fun.
[59:37.86]I'm not excited yet.
[59:39.82]In fact... Fuck this.
[59:42.40]You know what I mean?
[59:52.44]Lucky hit chance?
[59:56.96]What is... Is a lucky hit a crit?
[60:00.89]Lucky hit.
[60:02.81]I don't get it.
[60:10.67]It's a baby crit.
[60:16.33]Okay, well.
[60:19.53]So another thing I want to ask, which is important.
[60:23.36]I didn't really think to ask this question originally.
[60:28.12]This is not...
[60:30.95]Because Diablo 3 was like weapon power is what scaled everything.
[60:38.04]So this is just 4 damage and burning for 16 damage.
[60:42.30]Is it like Diablo II and they just kind of got away from that and its skills just do damage and you get plus to skills?
[60:48.88]Or is it based on your weapon damage?
[60:53.91]It is weapon damage.
[60:59.74]It's weapon damage and intelligence.
[61:04.15]I never played Diablo in my life.
[61:06.43]Ask Nancy.
[61:07.07]Oh, I'll ask.
[61:10.33]Yeah, I'll ask her.
[61:11.00]Let's hear what she says.
[61:22.13]She's been reading this note.
[61:28.08]It's still 9.30, so no time has passed.
[61:39.74]Guys, only one minute passed.
[61:41.50]It's fine.
[61:41.98]Alright, we're fine.
[61:53.99]Wait.
[61:54.57]Okay, hold on.
[61:55.21]It's 9.32.
[61:55.43]Wait, I need to save it.
[62:02.80]I need to know.
[62:06.72]I'm saving the game.
[62:07.68]Okay.
[62:15.00]We're just going to let this run and see what happens.
[62:17.78]Check back on her every 30 minutes.
[62:19.36]Okay.
[62:20.08]That sounds like a good idea.
[62:20.96]We'll see what happens.
[62:21.56]She's looking at a wardrobe right now.
[62:24.91]I'm curious what happens.
[62:36.00]Six months are gonna go by.
[62:37.10]She hasn't left her room.
[62:39.64]She's gonna be a skeleton when you go back.
[62:58.82]That's it?
[62:59.12]Was that a yellow?
[63:00.40]Oh, what?
[63:05.83]Cool.
[63:25.15]Put Nancy Drew in the corner.
[63:27.45]I wish I could do that because that would be very funny and be a very interesting little joke to do today.
[63:32.78]That game is so old.
[63:35.20]It takes over the whole computer and it makes your resolution.
[63:39.46]It just ruins the resolution on every screen.
[63:41.93]And I just it's not possible.
[64:15.03]Put Diablo in the corner then No, you don't understand I can't I can't like I cannot interact with any screen when Nancy Drew is active on a monitor.
[64:26.00]I
[64:45.50]Put it in windowed?
[64:46.32]I tried, you can't.
[64:47.58]It's too old.
[64:50.17]That's a cool little first boss.
[64:57.57]This is cool!
[65:23.85]I wonder how many difficulty tiers there's going to be.
[65:39.02]Die!
[65:44.11]Alright.
[65:45.79]We gotta split this gear up.
[65:47.57]I know, it's... Alright, alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes.
[65:51.27]Okay, so who's gonna get what?
[65:53.50]I mean, you're the rogue, so you should definitely take the dagger.
[65:55.94]And I'm a sorcerer, so I should probably get the staff.
[65:58.76]But, I'm just relaxed.
[66:01.00]I'll take it, so I can identify it, and then... Core skill damage.
[66:15.78]I'm imagining that's just abilities, right?
[66:23.49]Because what core skill I'm imagining is these are not core skills.
[66:36.88]That's alright.
[66:38.10]I feel like it's not worth a point right now.
[66:42.52]Did I just beef up Fireball?
[66:51.35]Oh, core, core.
[66:52.43]I get it, yeah.
[66:57.15]I don't want to spread out too thin.
[66:58.13]I think it's just Fireball.
[67:07.97]After casting a non-basic skill, you gain 2% resistance to all elements and 1% additional resistance to that skill's element.
[67:17.54]That's not number goes higher when you click on somebody.
[67:21.40]Boring.
[67:26.19]Okay.
[67:26.35]Let's do it with Fireball.
[67:33.21]That was pretty cool.
[67:36.41]That's fun.
[67:45.25]I'm very much enjoying this more than I...
[67:49.88]I don't know.
[67:50.36]Stop saying things.
[67:51.50]I don't want to look back six months from now and be like, remember when you played Diablo 4 and it's beta and you were like, wow, oh my god, it's so good.
[67:59.08]You know what I mean?
[68:01.34]I'm having a good time.
[68:02.83]I'm having a good time.
[68:09.05]Truly.
[68:17.49]Centrist Andy.
[68:20.19]That's not even a... I'm just having a decent time playing the game.
[68:23.13]I think it's fun so far.
[68:25.00]That's me taking a take.
[68:26.74]That's a take.
[69:07.47]Somebody get Nancy Drew on the fucking line.
[69:09.90]There's been a murder!
[69:22.03]What's wrong with me?
[69:42.03]What the hell is going on?
[70:11.35]Heard it up.
[70:43.09]So what?
[70:43.37]This wasn't a town after all.
[70:44.63]This was a... Is this like a... They kind of like poisoned me or are they going to like sacrifice me or something?
[71:20.82]By mother's blood... ...by mother's body... ...so... ...shall you... ...witness her glory.
[71:32.59]Before you die.
[71:33.80]Not ready yet.
[71:57.47]Eh... THEY'RE COMING!
[71:59.65]THE WHOLE DAMNED VILLAGE!
[72:02.28]GET UP!
[72:04.40]GET UP!
[72:05.66]WE HAVE TO FIGHT OUR WAY OUT!
[72:06.96]THERE!
[72:08.71]TAKE THEM!
[72:09.81]May the light preserve us.
[72:17.05]LOST SOULS!
[72:26.33]Oh, a leather Dublin.
[72:27.95]I think that's better for me.
[72:39.39]That was cool.
[72:41.27]That was creepy.
[72:42.61]Interesting.
[72:46.40]You are blessed like us now.
[72:52.92]That was all of them.
[72:55.31]Light wheeling.
[72:59.77]Oh, hold on.
[73:00.29]Wait a minute.
[73:05.05]Oh.
[73:07.05]More healing received.
[73:11.41]Oh, it's a dagger.
[73:12.31]I need to put that on the bar, don't I?
[73:15.87]Hmm.
[73:17.23]Am I ever going to be doing this?
[73:19.00]Probably not ever.
[73:27.47]You're the madman from the shed.
[73:29.91]Madman?
[73:31.31]Those heretics drugged me after I returned from the ruins.
[73:35.14]Just like you.
[73:36.92]I came to my wits and escaped.
[73:39.30]Tried to get inside the chapel, but it was locked.
[73:49.59]What manner of evil is this?
[73:51.47]What the fuck?
[73:52.71]Petals?
[73:54.47]I don't think that came out that way.
[73:56.42]They must have fed them to me.
[74:02.30]A blasphemous ritual.
[74:04.52]How did they learn this?
[74:06.78]Perhaps the answer lies in the chapel.
[74:10.32]They kept it locked up for a reason.
[74:13.93]The key might be on that woman who was leading them.
[74:20.34]Mute your mic.
[74:21.83]No.
[74:23.73]Okay, loot the chapel key from this corpse.
[74:28.65]Oh, cool.
[74:39.82]Okay.
[74:41.32]What else is going on over here?
[74:45.97]Why does it want me to go this way?
[74:52.73]Oh.
[75:00.04]Um... Okay.
[75:07.69]It's in beta.
[75:21.84]Dude, the smart thing to do is just always have your game in 0.999.
[75:24.68]It's just you're never in 1.0.
[75:28.34]It's still, you know.
[75:31.02]Just don't ever come out of beta.
[75:31.92]Nancy Drew would have solved this.
[76:22.60]Those who they're asked.
[76:23.30]Yeah, I'm playing the Resident Evil 4 remake on launch day Bet your ass that's happening Shameful Our father has granted you a path to salvation
[76:49.65]So if you eat these you...
[77:19.07]Sin is their birthright Oh my god The lords of hell are coming to devour our world Salvation lies not in the light But in you
[77:49.23]The faith has taught you to deny your heart's desire and turned you into a prisoner within yourself.
[77:58.74]She says she's made out of wood.
[78:02.04]Break the chains and discover who you were meant to be.
[78:11.15]Break the chains and be beautiful in sin.
[78:27.79]What are you doing?
[78:28.39]What?
[78:29.79]What the hell?
[78:30.13]What's going on?
[78:31.25]Why is this-
[79:00.06]Let's just blow it out.
[79:09.43]My god, they just destroyed this guy.
[79:25.86]Go to the Dry Steps and continue your preparations.
[79:32.00]Now, our true work begins.
[79:54.14]one minute has passed in the world of Nancy Drew so hey guys one minute in Nancy Drew time is an hour in real life right it's like this that time is past slower here um let me just go ahead and do uh reconnect
[80:21.24]Let me just start the queue again, and it's... The queue's just gonna get longer and longer, isn't it?
[80:28.87]It was PM before?
[80:31.99]Was it?
[80:34.03]No.
[80:40.27]Yes, it was?
[80:42.13]No, it wasn't.
[80:42.83]Just give me a second, I gotta just reconnect.
[80:47.64]Reconnect.
[80:50.92]It's so funny, like, immersion.
[80:55.46]Like, this unbelievable... Okay, it's a 20-minute cue, by the way.
[80:59.91]This amazing world of Diablo and all these crazy cutscenes and the immersion just gets snapped out of reality.
[81:10.35]When it's just like, and let them come.
[81:13.07]Let them try to find us.
[81:14.48]We will be buried into the caverns.
[81:17.02]Like...
[81:20.15]YOU'VE BEEN DISCONNECTED!
[81:21.23]IT'S A VIDEO GAME!
[81:22.03]IT'S A VIDEO GAME!
[81:22.71]IT'S A VIDEO GAME!
[81:23.33]IT'S A VIDEO GAME!
[81:24.27]It's like, aww, shit.
[81:26.07]Okay, it's a video game.
[81:27.67]It's right.
[81:28.25]Dammit.
[81:30.36]It's a video game.
[81:31.78]And I'm connected to a video game.
[81:39.17]Do you imagine if you went to a movie, and 10, 20 minutes into the movie, there's a very touching scene with this like, or very insane scene, something crazy happens.
[81:47.38]And the movie, it's like, whoa, like Thanos, like, and it freezes on Thanos doing this with like the Infinity Gauntlet.
[81:55.18]And it just says, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that you are watching a movie.
[82:00.62]This is a movie.
[82:02.05]And isn't it an interesting one?
[82:06.99]Now, please use the bathroom.
[82:09.39]Please go and get some snacks at the concession stand.
[82:13.62]We'll be back in 20 minutes.
[82:15.02]It's like, dude, I was fucking watching that.
[82:21.52]That's kind of how it feels, like playing a day one launch sometimes.
[82:27.12]Okay, I'm ready.
[82:33.82]No, I'm clicking out of the window.
[82:35.42]Come on.
[82:38.01]Alright, so what are we doing?
[82:40.51]Am I like opening this person's door?
[82:58.27]I have to call Ned.
[83:05.49]No, we're not doing that.
[83:11.01]This must be where I drop the laundry bag after I'm done cleaning all the rooms.
[83:15.51]This chute is for dirty laundry.
[83:16.96]Okay, so we're gonna clean the rooms.
[83:26.65]Wha- huh?
[83:29.25]What was that?
[83:30.59]What was that?
[84:07.95]I gotta clean the rooms.
[84:15.43]Don't I have the key?
[84:23.14]How do I get in here?
[84:28.52]How do I get in here?
[84:29.08]You have to make breakfast first.
[84:45.36]Okay.
[84:45.58]Find the bone.
[84:46.12]Sorry, I've been playing a lot of Diablo.
[84:48.14]Blue, red, white, green, blue, red.
[85:15.82]Somebody remember that one.
[85:28.39]Hmm.
[85:33.72]How would you read that?
[85:34.82]That's like two point font.
[85:46.73]Sasquatch sightings hit five-year low.
[85:51.15]Area Man attacked by Wolverine.
[85:56.37]That's just the name of the next Marvel movie coming up.
[86:01.06]Don't forget to catch Area Man attacked by Wolverine in theaters this Friday.
[86:08.80]We're getting there.
[86:16.72]I think that- oh, hello.
[86:19.80]Hey.
[86:27.13]What's your name again?
[86:28.77]Nancy.
[86:29.41]Nancy Drew.
[86:30.35]Just thought I'd come over and say hello.
[86:32.53]Well, Lou here is a grad student.
[86:34.46]Art major, of all things.
[86:36.30]You're probably gonna need a jackhammer and some hydrochloric acid to clean his room, eh?
[86:41.06]Are you two old friends?
[86:42.70]Not hardly.
[86:43.58]I've known Lou for all of, what?
[86:45.38]About a week, I guess.
[86:47.04]I checked in right after he did.
[86:48.76]We sat down after breakfast one morning and discovered that this fox and geese game is pretty darn fun.
[86:53.85]I've been whipping his tail ever since.
[86:56.69]Hmm.
[86:59.11]You didn't just come here to play games, did you?
[87:01.34]Heck no.
[87:03.00]I came for the ice fishing.
[87:04.44]Course, knowing there's a renegade wolf running around is kind of dampening my enthusiasm.
[87:09.27]Have you seen the wolf?
[87:14.11]Have you seen the wolf?
[87:15.89]Just heard it.
[87:16.87]Every night since I've been here, in fact.
[87:19.19]Gets creepier each time.
[87:21.13]They should get rid of it, and the sooner the better.
[87:23.51]They didn't put up with wolves prowling around this place 40 years ago, and they shouldn't put up with them now.
[87:28.14]Who would argue, Little Red Riding Hood?
[87:31.02]That wolf's not hurting anybody.
[87:33.06]People should just leave it alone.
[87:35.06]You'll be singing a different tune when it has some little kid for breakfast than has you for lunch.
[87:40.39]Alright, gotta shovel the pond.
[88:07.54]Get that pond shoveled so we can settle this, okay, kiddo?
[88:10.48]Consider it done.
[88:11.54]Okay.
[88:14.19]So we gotta shovel the pond.
[88:21.45]Not time for kitchen duty yet.

[90:10.36]Mooses?
[90:11.28]Moose?
[90:11.54]It's just moose, right?
[90:12.28]Okay.
[90:19.11]All moose?
[90:24.81]All meese.
[90:26.45]Meeses.
[90:26.91]Alright, you're distracting me.
[90:32.14]Okay, let's figure this out.
[90:35.60]If I need to do all moose.
[90:44.12]Fuck.
[90:44.94]I'm so torn apart in like three directions.
[90:48.89]Okay, I need to just get a second.
[91:00.86]Okay.
[91:02.22]Alright, I'm ready.
[91:04.46]This needs to be... So to get this all... So I need to get this... Let's go like this.
[91:12.33]Raccoon, raccoon, raccoon.
[91:17.08]Raccoon.
[91:18.04]Raccoon.
[91:19.46]Raccoon.
[91:22.72]There we go.
[91:24.48]Now, there we are.
[91:26.32]Okay.
[91:27.76]Easy.
[91:28.26]It wasn't even hard.
[91:39.30]I messed it up.
[92:00.68]I got it.
[92:06.24]It's not all Mises.
[92:15.73]It needs to be all raccoons.
[92:18.75]All wolves, all pigs, all raccoons, all mooses.
[92:21.87]What is it?
[92:22.25]Is it wolves?
[92:23.72]It's definitely wolves.
[92:24.68]Alright, everything is ready.
[92:25.80]I just have to move it.
[92:29.30]It's definitely, why would it, why would it be moose?
[92:31.50]The whole game is based around this ice wolf in the forest.
[92:36.51]Why would it be moose?
[92:39.21]Okay, let's get it.
[93:03.80]That's all wolves!
[93:07.14]I don't think we have the solution to this yet.
[93:18.51]Worth a shot.
[93:27.16]Chicken Ridge.
[93:29.78]Okay, so they want me to go outside.
[93:32.34]I could do that.
[93:38.14]What is that?
[93:53.39]There's the lake.
[93:55.15]Yo, you'll be fine.
[93:57.73]Just bring enough sandwiches to last you a day or two.
[94:00.71]Okay, here we go.
[94:03.13]Skating pond.
[94:13.97]Don't ever underestimate the power of four bologna and cheese sandwiches wrapped in, like, sandwich wrap.
[94:24.28]Don't ever underestimate it.
[94:26.16]Guess I better get this pond shoveled off.
[94:30.70]Okay.
[94:32.47]So, I need to...
[94:45.16]How do I do that?
[94:55.93]It's like my sweeper, but how do I hold click?
[95:03.00]Holding click is not doing anything.
[95:16.49]Bash it with the shovel.
[95:18.03]Start in a corner.
[95:20.15]Oh, shit.
[95:20.71]Okay, so this is unsafe.
[95:25.83]Alright, don't touch that one.
[95:34.70]So this is unsafe.
[95:37.64]How do I know it's safe?
[95:43.50]Just don't step on that.
[95:50.03]So wait, this is safe, this is unsafe.
[95:57.26]He's never played Minesweeper?
[95:58.40]I mean, I've played the amount of time that most people that have a Windows machine played Minesweeper, and as you opened it for 10 seconds, put it on the highest possible difficulty, and then clicked in one spot and lost.
[96:14.33]Or, you put it on the lowest possible difficulty, click in three places, and win.
[96:22.80]I understand the concept of Minesweeper, but like a... What am I trying to... I guess I'm just... Right?
[96:33.00]Okay.
[96:34.40]So that means that there... I don't even know what this is trying to tell me, though.
[96:42.64]Alright, so this is a little bit... This is kind of a... Yeah?
[96:44.60]Whoa!
[96:52.40]Yes, but I'm okay now.
[96:53.82]I just got a little wet and cold.
[96:55.82]Actually, I got really cold.
[96:57.52]My lips turned this really interesting shade of violet.
[97:00.08]You're supposed to be investigating accidents, not having them.
[97:04.64]I know.
[97:05.10]I'll be more careful next time.
[97:06.47]I promise.
[97:07.57]I'd like to believe that, Nancy, but I just can't afford to.
[97:11.43]I'm in enough trouble with my insurance company already.
[97:14.51]You don't mean... Oh, but I do mean you're fired.
[97:25.11]If you don't want to concern your employer, you don't say... You know what I mean?
[97:30.93]Like, oh, yeah.
[97:32.45]Hey, so everything okay?
[97:33.65]Oh, yeah.
[97:34.07]Hey, dude, my lips turned this really crazy shade of purple.
[97:38.79]It's like, huh?
[97:42.23]What are you talking about?
[97:45.15]That was like a funny thing for Nancy to say.
[97:48.57]That was like, oh, my lips turned purple.
[97:52.07]Are you alright?
[97:53.51]No, no, no, no, no.
[97:54.69]You got to go check.
[97:55.19]We got to check you out at the doctor.
[97:59.25]Guess I better get this pawn shoveled off.
[98:02.67]Okay, well.
[98:03.19]It's been fun, Nancy.
[98:11.37]See you in a little bit.
[98:13.92]Don't worry, Nancy.
[98:14.82]We absolutely will be back.
[98:25.27]See you in probably 30 minutes.
[98:37.66]She's freezing.
[98:38.88]She's fine.
[98:42.68]There's a timer.
[98:48.41]I don't think the game, uh, here's the thing.
[98:50.39]I don't think the game is active if it is alt-tabbed.
[98:55.78]I think we're gonna be fine.
[98:58.26]I believe the Nancy Drew client has to be active.
[99:10.09]My lips turned this wacky shade of violet.
[99:18.35]Only fire can cleanse the darkness and I can do that this Have a look inside, but hurry I will prepare the torch Blood petals like the ones I was fed Here we already saw this some this really
[99:49.95]We already saw that.
[99:51.17]Okay.
[99:51.63]We are good.
[99:52.77]Why'd you skip?
[99:58.55]Did we not see that one?
[100:18.33]Oh shit, that's right.
[100:19.43]It happened.
[100:19.79]Oh, that's right.
[100:21.87]Oops.
[100:22.34]Can you say it again?
[100:22.86]Oops.
[100:26.52]Because it ended... Oh, I forgot.
[100:28.00]Sorry.
[100:28.18]It's a beta.
[100:28.84]We're going to see this all in a week or two anyways.
[100:42.43]Alright, there's a hermit that I have to find.
[100:44.87]Lilith is able to manipulate people.
[100:49.72]She's the lord of manipulation.
[100:53.04]Lord of, alright.
[100:55.66]Permanent stat boost to all characters on the realm.
[101:02.35]Maximum capacity of murmuring eyeballs.
[101:05.33]Claim an altar of Lilith.
[101:12.82]OK.
[101:15.62]Interesting.
[101:20.98]This is permanent.
[101:23.85]Reward lucky commoner player title.
[101:29.23]Alright, let's keep going.
[101:35.45]Very loud.
[101:46.04]Guys, it's still so loud.
[101:47.36]Every time I restart the game, it gets louder.
[101:49.50]Gold.
[102:16.60]Thunderbear.
[102:17.42]Is this an elite?
[102:30.89]How do I sell stuff?
[102:37.68]This looks like a granny-like.
[102:39.34]I can assure you it's not.
[102:40.36]Nancy Drew is more a granny-like than this.
[102:43.90]That's actually a fact.
[103:00.98]All of your hits are crits.
[103:02.08]Going fast too.
[103:29.09]Random dungeon.
[103:30.61]Cellars are small chambers that can contain a wide range of content.
[103:35.49]Let's check it out.
[103:53.58]Eternal Tempest Engaged Skeleton Captain.
[104:13.88]Tell him not.
[104:23.39]Okay, so that was just like an Elite.
[104:29.93]Cool.
[104:30.77]Anything else in here?
[104:31.33]What do you think Nancy Drew's internal temperature is right now?
[104:36.58]Uh, probably low.
[104:49.57]Slain militia.
[104:51.29]Ooh.
[104:53.13]Should I salvage?
[104:53.93]Should I just hold the salvage button?
[104:57.19]Right?
[104:57.39]Because you can do that, can't you?
[104:59.23]Oh, and a mark as junk.
[105:04.15]Is this junk?
[105:09.63]Okay, hold on a second.
[105:15.33]52 damage a second.
[105:16.58]This is a staff.
[105:20.36]I definitely should put this on.
[105:21.44]This is more plus the core damage.
[105:31.25]Yeah.
[105:31.43]I'm going to this way.
[105:54.46]Oh, man.
[105:56.15]Get Elden Ringed.
[105:59.81]Is this... Okay.
[106:14.02]Resistance to all one max health.
[106:16.19]Better than nothing.
[106:16.87]Better than nothing.
[106:38.55]He's in greens.
[106:40.33]Omega law.
[106:44.22]I just started the game.
[106:45.86]I like fire.
[107:03.97]It's good.
[107:04.75]I like the big splash.
[107:20.34]Challenge Swift hunter was I mean I'm down Green is frozen
[108:09.31]Oh, Nancy is.
[108:10.23]Yeah, I see what you mean.
[108:12.29]I see.
[108:33.86]I think I'm going the right way, right?
[108:41.02]Group up, group up, group up.
[108:46.08]Am I the only streamer doing fire?
[108:50.20]If not, I'll change.
[109:01.05]What else is down here?
[109:01.83]Okay.
[109:11.67]Is anybody else streaming this?
[109:13.59]I think a lot of people were today, weren't they?
[109:14.85]Alright, let's go back up.
[109:23.64]Alright, find the hermit's cabin.
[109:37.10]Herbs and ore can be found throughout the world and are used by artisans for a variety of functions.
[109:46.73]Wait, you, wait, you, there's... There's material, there's like... Okay.
[110:00.72]Lightberry?
[110:01.36]There's crafting.
[110:05.56]This is literally Fortnite.
[110:06.74]Okay.
[110:09.81]I don't mind crafting, though.
[110:16.16]Light crafting is fun.
[110:18.14]I think it's cool.
[110:19.60]I don't mind it.
[110:25.40]I actually do not mind random busy work in-game sometimes.
[110:30.46]I don't really mind it.
[110:41.22]You know, this is the kind of thing you just hop in a Discord call and it's just like, you're just doing it.
[110:54.83]Doing what?
[110:55.67]Picking up herbs and spices and ore.
[111:01.13]And you make like a, like a steak.
[111:03.07]That's my one friend.
[111:10.03]I have one friend.
[111:14.48]Okay.
[111:16.30]Or... Picking up herbs with the bros.
[111:23.72]Yeah, sometimes you just pick up herbs with the bros!
[111:25.74]Is this better?
[111:41.15]Will... Okay, hold on.
[111:42.17]I should look at this first.
[111:44.95]Strength is armor.
[111:50.17]This is skill damage and resistance.
[111:54.15]This is resource gen.
[111:56.51]Healing received.
[111:58.45]And what is overpower damage?
[112:05.57]Overpower.
[112:07.15]These are new terms.
[112:11.60]Lucky hits.
[112:13.66]Overpower damage.
[112:14.57]This is new.
[112:14.99]I don't know.
[112:24.31]Aspects.
[112:26.05]I'm going to run out of inventory space.
[112:30.27]Eh, whatever.
[112:31.47]Why is it still glowing?
[112:37.56]How much are you throwing in for the herbs?
[112:47.47]Are you gonna play Pizza Tower some more?
[112:48.71]Probably not.
[112:50.31]Not on stream.
[112:52.47]I think I got exactly what I wanted out of that game and it was fantastic, so... I'm not really the type to get, you know, P rank or S rank on every level, so... I got what I wanted out of it.
[113:10.76]Is anyone here?
[113:16.12]No, I got it the first try, I wanted to like, look around.
[113:18.43]I wanted to Nancy Drew- By the way, how- you- Nancy, how you doing?
[113:22.59]You alright?
[113:30.57]We're fine.
[113:31.19]I didn't- I didn't mean to click it twice.
[113:54.17]She's alright.
[114:04.34]Herbs, mushrooms, organs.
[114:07.34]A healer's tools.
[114:11.84]Okay.
[114:12.17]I just want to see if there's anything in it.
[114:20.35]Strange skull.
[114:21.25]Oh.
[114:23.30]Okay.
[115:19.43]If you're going to trespass into my home.
[115:25.55]Rifle through my things.
[115:29.53]Then at least have the decency to join me for supper.
[115:35.08]I'm bloody hungry.
[115:38.12]Is not the is not the response I would think would happen.
[115:44.30]That's quite the story.
[115:47.94]I wish it wasn't true, but it is.
[115:54.52]Why did I have that vision?
[115:57.16]Thank those friendly villagers.
[115:58.78]They gave you the blood of Lilith.
[116:05.20]The blood of a demon?
[116:07.84]Not just any demon.
[116:10.32]The daughter of hatred.
[116:12.58]The mother of sanctuary.
[116:15.80]She was banished ages ago.
[116:19.08]But this world is her creation.
[116:25.36]It was prophesied she would come back.
[116:27.90]We know this person's name.
[116:31.07]That's the question.
[116:33.75]Sanctuary has always been trapped amid the eternal conflict.
[116:38.69]A war between angels and demons.
[116:42.26]But Lilith serves neither side.
[116:45.17]She has her own plans for us.
[116:47.91]And me.
[116:49.45]Am I corrupt?
[116:50.59]People that have booming, low voices like this, I wonder what happens if you pitch this down.
[116:56.93]What will you do about it?
[116:58.89]What would it sound like?
[117:00.37]Use it.
[117:01.77]Find out what she's after.
[117:04.92]Good.
[117:06.44]Then we're in this together.
[117:09.04]Rest while you can.
[117:11.55]Then we'll start some key overshot.
[117:13.37]Do it.
[117:13.75]I don't know.
[117:14.75]I don't know.
[117:15.45]Recording software right here.
[117:17.12]Record the audio.
[117:19.12]We'll all be damned.
[117:27.02]Okay.
[117:31.60]Company Lorath to Kilvashad.
[117:36.28]Oh, wait.
[117:37.28]I have new points, don't I?
[117:39.72]Alright, should I be boring Barry and just keep doing fireball or should I do something else?
[117:51.43]That's kind of good.
[117:57.81]The radius increases for distance traveled.
[118:03.03]That's pretty good.
[118:05.17]Keep it hot.
[118:06.13]Keep it hot.
[118:07.09]Okay.
[118:07.19]Okay.
[118:18.63]I'm just gonna go boring berry.
[118:22.53]Herbs and spices and jewels and gems.
[118:28.41]I'm okay doing boring berry.
[118:29.49]It just works.
[118:50.52]I honestly don't, I can't hear what he's saying.
[119:05.94]Ah, shaman.
[119:22.51]Jerma changes audio mixing.
[119:23.69]Jerma, I can't hear what he says.
[119:24.81]Yeah, but I mean... The audio mixing is in line with the way that it... You know what I'm saying?
[119:35.72]Like, I should be able to hear it fine.
[119:38.66]The audio mixing was fine.
[119:40.28]It's just... You know what?
[119:41.96]Time that person out for one full minute.
[119:48.27]Okay, it's the effects volume that has to come down.
[119:51.93]Dialog come up, effects come down, music up a little.
[119:55.26]Master volume up a little bit, ambient down.
[119:58.11]Dialog up.
[119:59.89]There.
[120:02.01]Perfect.
[120:16.82]Out of mana.
[120:17.44]Alright, now that's too loud.
[120:19.10]That sounds like he's talking into my ears.
[120:20.68]He just leaned over from behind my chair.
[120:25.32]Out of mana.
[120:27.14]Dude, what the fuck?
[120:28.61]Get away from me.
[120:34.85]Never thought I'd live to see your worst.
[121:02.21]I'm just imagining there's a fucking actor in the room right now.
[121:07.41]The angel in Arius.
[121:10.13]I'm sure you've heard the Cathedral of Light.
[121:11.67]He's dressed as a sorcerer.
[121:14.68]Well, he's real.
[121:16.78]An angel walks across his arms, pacing back and forth with a cloak on.
[121:22.22]Blood will flow.
[121:23.26]I wouldn't have done it like that.
[121:26.24]They'll drag the whole damn world into their feud unless we can stop it.
[121:33.47]That's not Linga.
[121:34.99]Key Overshot lies just ahead.
[121:46.51]Roads blocked.
[121:48.35]Should clear up when the storm has passed.
[122:04.35]Oh, it's a town.
[122:07.31]You need to have an original thought right now.
[122:10.44]What are you talking about?
[122:11.46]We have no time for this.
[122:17.68]What does that mean?
[122:19.60]To enter Kyovoshad, you must perform a cleansing ritual.
[122:23.21]Meaningless gesture, but some people take comfort in it.
[122:27.01]How dare you?
[122:29.36]Just let him through, lad.
[122:31.48]I've tried for years to get Lorath to do the ritual.
[122:36.04]Fine.
[122:37.00]But this one stays.
[122:39.62]I'll meet you inside.
[122:44.10]Take a piece of holy cedar wood from the shrine and inscribe it with the sin which troubles you.
[122:51.45]Then, cast it into the brazier.
[122:54.69]As the fire burns the wood, so too will the light burn away your sin.
[123:00.45]I mean, I'm fire, so... Let's do it.
[123:14.10]Okay, let's grab fear into the wood, anger, pride, greed, or just scribble all over it.
[123:21.91]I don't think I want to do this because what if I write something I don't know what it says and it's something really bad and I don't want to have that be burnt into my character?
[123:29.10]Hmm.
[123:34.34]No.
[123:34.52]Hmm.
[123:37.18]Hmm.
[123:40.99]Great.
[123:41.73]Great.
[123:48.19]That means I get extra gold for kill, right?
[123:58.80]It's probably some bonus, right?
[123:59.74]It's probably a money bonus.
[124:00.46]Okay.
[124:22.21]Well, a man that old has lived through some dark days.
[124:26.98]Explains why he's so cross.
[124:29.68]Okay, it's time to take a BRRB because I'm going to come back and I'm going to give you a little bit of Grotto Beasts info.
[124:39.42]Not long.
[124:40.02]Just going to give you a couple of quick little pieces of information.
[124:44.36]It'll take literally two minutes.
[124:48.38]And by that I mean I'm not leaving yet.
[124:50.90]I'm going to leave in about 20 minutes.
[124:57.13]So just be aware that in like 20 minutes I'm going to leave and then I'll come back with some info.
[125:01.75]There you go.
[125:02.25]Sorry about that.
[125:02.89]I had it completely wrong.
[125:05.82]It's my fault.
[125:06.80]What a bad announcement.
[125:08.91]So, what did you write on that piece of wood?
[125:13.14]Something about greed or gluttony, perhaps?
[125:16.42]Well, it matters little, I suppose.
[125:18.70]Where are you going?
[125:23.17]I'm off to the dry steps in search of that pale man from your vision.
[125:27.17]I must know...
[125:29.61]What party plays in all this?
[125:32.46]But first, I need you to retrieve something of mine while I finish my negotiations.
[125:36.94]A merchant in the center of the city has it.
[125:39.30]Just tell him I sent you.
[125:49.56]Okay.
[125:52.12]Stable merchant.
[125:55.00]Ooh.
[126:03.55]uh give me one sec drink water I've got a big ass water right here I've been drinking it the whole time when I go BRB I'll refill the water don't worry don't worry I'm good I'm hydrated I promise
[126:37.18]Let me do this.
[126:37.86]Let me do this.
[126:41.39]Let me do this.
[126:42.47]Okay.
[126:47.13]The mod said do slash dance.
[126:55.00]Really?
[127:01.68]That didn't do anything!
[127:02.55]Okay, so this seems like a big hub town then.
[127:08.97]Got ya.
[127:09.45]Okay, wait, waypoint.
[127:10.65]Are waypoints... What about town portals?
[127:34.55]Collections.
[127:35.76]Clan.
[127:36.34]I'm not joining a clan.
[127:45.56]Oh, wait.
[127:45.94]This is Blacksmith.
[127:47.74]Waypoints allow you to fast travel freely across sanctuary.
[127:50.16]Yep.
[127:51.70]Activate them.
[127:52.92]You can earn renown by completing various activities across the continent.
[127:55.85]Cool.
[127:58.15]Obtaining renown will grant rewards in certain thresholds.
[128:00.75]View the status of your renown for each region from the map.
[128:08.00]What will it be?
[128:09.40]Alright.
[128:12.32]So I can salvage just all junk.
[128:15.64]And imagining this means that it's just... Unlocks new look on a salvage.
[128:20.07]Oh, okay.
[128:20.63]Is that a stupid idea?
[128:40.24]Alright, let's just salvage this.
[128:47.58]Ah, there we go.
[128:53.57]This is better.
[128:54.97]Is it though?
[128:56.07]No, it's not.
[128:56.61]I want the willpower.
[128:59.21]Okay.
[129:03.67]Repair.
[129:07.11]Upgrade.
[129:07.85]Can't really do anything with that yet.
[129:15.48]If you press P, you'll pee.
[129:17.74]That's made up.
[129:18.80]And it's an incredibly immature thing to say.
[129:22.86]In fact, that's just... That's just... It's a very immature thing for you to say.
[129:28.15]I'm not going to tolerate that.
[129:39.97]Purveyor of Curiosities.
[129:46.19]25 of this.
[129:49.57]The curiosity event.
[129:50.71]Is this gambling?
[129:53.47]How do I get?
[129:54.03]Okay, this is gold.
[129:54.93]This is red PVP.
[129:58.08]And this is all balls.
[129:59.52]How do I get those?
[130:00.20]An in-game currency.
[130:04.52]Okay.
[130:16.18]I don't think I'm gonna buy or do anything.
[130:17.38]What's that?
[130:17.72]Is it like a random event?
[130:25.24]How fair is the city guard?
[130:26.18]Okay, I need to know what's going on here.
[130:27.62]Hold on, I need to know what's going on here.
[130:30.34]I need to know what's going on.
[130:31.83]What's going on right now?
[130:32.75]Hold on a second.
[130:33.39]Okay, so this is a side quest.
[130:58.84]What's happening here?
[131:00.48]Okay.
[131:06.50]So, this is a little side quest?
[131:08.14]There are side quests in Diablo 4?
[131:10.26]Hold on.
[131:16.97]Okay, never mind.
[131:17.85]It's nothing.
[131:20.51]Never mind.
[131:21.45]Fossil arm.
[131:22.01]Fossil arm.
[131:26.67]Alright, I got a little distracted.
[131:27.59]What was I doing here?
[131:29.68]Let us in on the joke.
[131:30.76]I don't know.
[131:31.35]I got distracted.
[131:32.03]Alright, what was going on here?
[131:34.63]Cool.
[131:35.03]Cheer at the training area.
[131:40.61]How?
[131:42.71]Cheer.
[131:49.69]E. Oh.
[131:58.45]So there is a dance.
[132:09.30]Is there a dance?
[132:10.00]There's no dance.
[132:16.78]What?
[132:22.07]It's kind of a dance.
[132:38.38]Thanks.
[132:39.72]I hope they don't get used to it.
[132:41.16]I guess I'm renowned.
[132:48.91]What's that?
[132:50.33]Oh, I got like a loot chest.
[132:53.41]Oh, an herb cache.
[132:55.47]Let's open it.
[133:08.62]Back to Nancy.
[133:19.64]I crashed the server.
[133:21.60]Wait, I crashed the server?
[133:23.18]No, I didn't.
[133:32.03]I don't think I crashed the whole server.
[133:38.94]Alright, what's the queue time?
[133:44.08]I got disconnected too.
[133:47.33]That means we all got disconnected.
[133:51.21]21 minutes.
[133:52.89]Long enough for us to just go like this.
[133:56.75]Can you see it?
[133:57.53]No, you can't.
[134:01.05]No, you can't.
[134:01.51]Alright, let me get this.
[134:02.17]How do I do this?
[134:05.39]Guess I better get this pawn shoveled off.
[134:07.66]Okay.
[134:15.46]Alright, so that means that there is one crack.
[134:20.87]So there's one... This means there's one crack.
[134:23.57]So that means it has to be here.
[134:31.79]Right?
[134:32.03]Because it was there before.
[134:36.78]Zero.
[134:37.28]There's nothing here.
[134:39.78]But is it adjacent?
[134:41.80]Like, it's just one, two, or three.
[134:44.18]So it can't be here.
[134:46.77]That means it has to be either here or here.
[134:48.25]I'm going to say here?
[134:51.68]No.
[134:53.06]That means zero.
[134:54.18]Zero.
[134:54.46]So it has to be right there.
[134:55.82]Okay.
[134:56.50]So now I know.
[135:02.17]There we go.
[135:06.86]What?
[135:19.84]I have a question.
[135:20.36]I have a question.
[135:23.29]That means it's zero here, here, here, and here, right?
[135:28.37]That's how Minesweeper works.
[135:29.29]This is zero here, right?
[135:32.48]Okay.
[135:33.76]That means it has to be right there.
[135:34.68]I don't play this game.
[135:55.54]Oh, shit.
[136:01.38]Zero.
[136:01.84]Oh, okay.
[136:04.54]Alright, hold on.
[136:09.00]Zero.
[136:11.44]Zero.
[136:17.58]All eight squares around a zero are not mine.
[136:19.88]Okay.
[136:33.27]That's what I thought.
[136:44.22]That just scared the shit out of me.
[136:45.28]They're definitely going to sell dances.
[137:01.33]I don't know what they're going to do.
[137:07.45]I made this way harder on myself for no reason.
[137:22.62]Okay.
[137:25.54]Alright.
[137:26.42]So this means there's two.
[137:30.08]It means it has to be one here.
[137:36.32]And one here.
[137:39.42]Has to be.
[137:41.48]This means there has to be one here and here.
[137:43.76]Technically could be the same.
[137:45.08]This one could be here and here.
[137:46.94]This one's two could be here, but also could be here.
[137:54.96]This one is two.
[137:56.97]One, two.
[137:57.83]Has to be there.
[137:59.75]This one is also two.
[138:00.71]Has to be here.
[138:02.45]Because one, two.
[138:04.69]One, two.
[138:04.89]Has to be.
[138:13.95]What do you mean no?
[138:16.19]What do you mean?
[138:16.81]What?
[138:16.93]What do you mean wrong?
[138:19.54]This has... This is two.
[138:21.12]So this is one.
[138:23.28]Two.
[138:23.80]It has to be here.
[138:26.70]This is also a two.
[138:28.56]One, two.
[138:31.16]One, two.
[138:33.64]One, two.
[138:34.92]One, two.
[138:35.72]I think this is safe then.
[138:39.78]I'm intelligent.
[138:46.46]are all one okay well this it has to be here because there's nothing else it could be this could be it this could be it this is a two two has to be one but it could be this one here these might be safe I think they're safe thank you I was right
[139:16.56]Is one.
[139:17.02]That means this is safe.
[139:18.70]There's another one, right?
[139:20.62]Wait, no.
[139:22.40]It's talking about this one, technically.
[139:24.08]This is safe.
[139:30.96]Three.
[139:31.24]One, two, three.
[139:31.99]One, two.
[139:32.53]One, two, three.
[139:38.39]One, two.
[139:39.85]One, two.
[139:48.30]Can you just ditch this and pack a bowl on stream?
[139:51.87]No, dude.
[139:52.69]I'm busy.
[139:53.93]Oh, shut up.
[140:09.60]I thought it was talking about this one.
[140:12.18]What?
[140:15.56]How is it not talking about this one?
[140:20.01]What happened here?
[140:22.58]This is... How... Is it not adjacent?
[140:24.80]What is... That's one.
[140:26.96]This one is right... This... What?
[140:36.46]Who told me to put that cone there?
[140:44.00]One.
[140:44.98]Two.
[140:45.68]Three.
[140:45.98]There we go.
[140:51.59]One, two, three.
[140:56.56]One, two.
[140:57.42]It could be one, two.
[140:58.48]This is one.
[141:00.38]I just tried to guess.
[141:25.28]Okay, if this is just a one, then this is safe.
[141:30.62]One, two, who knows.
[141:37.03]One.
[141:37.71]So it has to be this one or this one.
[141:46.46]One, two, three.
[141:48.88]I don't know.
[141:49.16]I can't get this one.
[141:52.73]Do click maps, please?
[141:53.99]No.
[141:54.25]Have you never played Minesweeper?
[141:57.03]I don't play Minesweeper.
[141:58.61]I don't play it.
[142:05.00]Oh, this is wrong.
[142:13.96]Skill issue.
[142:14.80]Yeah, whatever.
[142:16.22]It can't be skilled at all, the things you try to do.
[142:23.93]Shut the fuck- Ban that person for an hour.
[142:29.21]Okay.
[142:29.43]Alright, let me- Let's pay attention here.
[142:35.43]So this is- These are safe, then.
[142:38.22]Because this is the only one.
[142:39.24]Here's another zero.
[143:07.25]Okay.
[143:10.03]Five.
[143:11.17]One, two, three, four, five.
[143:13.59]Damn.
[143:14.01]Okay.
[143:23.60]It's not five.
[143:24.88]Oh, it's four.
[143:26.46]Shit, it is four.
[143:30.14]Is it?
[143:33.47]One.
[143:34.57]Well, there's no way it's not here.
[143:36.87]One, two, three.
[143:37.71]Yeah, it's at least these three.
[143:38.81]Has to be two.
[143:45.04]Could be here.
[143:45.70]This has to be one.
[143:46.76]Could be there.
[143:48.84]This is three.
[143:50.22]One, two, three, potentially.
[143:51.94]This is three as well.
[143:53.10]One, two.
[143:54.62]No.
[143:57.50]Well, this is one, so it has to be there.
[143:59.48]This is also one.
[144:01.46]Therefore, this is safe.
[144:05.78]Therefore, this is safe as well.
[144:12.09]This has to be here.
[144:13.95]What are you talking about, bro?
[144:23.59]This is three.
[144:24.05]So one, two, three.
[144:25.03]That means this is safe.
[144:27.62]That means this is safe.
[144:31.96]This is not safe.
[144:34.72]Okay.
[144:41.85]Get off of this nonsense.
[144:45.99]I don't want to do this again.
[144:48.39]This is my timer.
[144:50.19]How long is that relative?
[144:51.75]Hold on a minute.
[144:54.81]The countdown right now for D4 is 10 minutes.
[144:57.81]It was 21 minutes.
[145:00.27]So this is 10 minutes of time.
[145:01.89]10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.
[145:05.02]This is almost 200 minutes of time.
[145:07.26]This is three hours.
[145:10.50]This is like a two to three hour timer.
[145:13.00]That's a lot of time to do this.
[145:26.87]Is that what that is happening?
[145:28.36]I can't tell.
[145:34.18]Alright.
[145:36.60]I'm almost there.
[145:40.05]Two.
[145:40.67]One, two.
[145:44.05]There's the three.
[145:44.75]One, two, three.
[145:45.39]Therefore, this is safe.
[145:46.95]This game's kind of fun.
[145:47.67]It kind of reminds me of Picross.
[145:51.49]One, two, three.
[145:54.86]There's the four.
[145:55.66]One, two, three, four.
[145:57.28]This is safe.
[146:03.24]There's your one.
[146:04.10]This is safe.
[146:06.80]This is not safe.
[146:10.23]This is.
[146:16.65]There are three more.
[146:18.13]I think that's it.
[146:23.33]It's safe to walk on the ice now.
[146:34.72]I guess not.
[146:35.84]Wait, wait, wait.
[146:48.68]This is not safe.
[146:51.52]Now is it safe?
[146:52.78]No.
[146:56.43]Am I missing a square?
[146:57.19]1, 2.
[146:58.99]OK.
[146:59.37]1, 2.
[146:59.41]1, 2.
[147:03.02]1, 2.
[147:03.42]Is it this one?
[147:09.00]Put them on the cracks.
[147:18.03]Oh.
[147:19.47]That ought to do it.
[147:20.79]Wait a second.
[147:22.21]Those look like wolf tracks.
[147:24.15]Maybe I should find out where they go.
[147:41.42]I don't know how to open it.
[148:12.96]Where am I?
[148:13.48]I don't know what the fuck I just did.
[148:23.82]Let's go back.
[148:42.98]Can I pull this?
[148:49.58]There's got to be something I can pull.
[149:00.67]Chicken Ridge.
[149:01.63]Okay, Chicken Ridge.
[149:04.09]Should I just go for it?
[149:08.95]I see tracks.
[149:12.54]Sounded like an explosion.
[149:14.80]Why is this wolf throwing grenades?
[149:25.11]Oh, no.
[149:30.01]What?
[149:34.37]I'm buried in snow.
[149:36.25]I've got to dig myself out before I run out of air.
[149:39.06]Oh, God.
[149:39.76]Okay.
[149:40.90]I'll never make it.
[149:42.92]It's gonna be the dog.
[149:46.66]Yeah, that's like... That's like a sniffing dog.
[149:49.66]Quick, just throw a raw turkey out there!
[150:13.65]It's gone.
[150:14.51]But thanks to that hole it dug, I can breathe again.
[150:17.91]Now, if I can just pull myself out.
[150:26.94]OK, well, we got to see the we got to see the wolf.
[150:34.66]That was pretty cool.
[150:45.70]Oh, this is where the grenade went off.
[150:57.87]What is it?
[151:01.93]Uh, warning, Diablo 4, there was a problem logging in.
[151:07.09]Well, that's not good.
[151:11.46]Oh, that's bad.
[151:14.66]Try it again.
[151:29.77]I'm going to laugh this is like two hours.
[151:34.69]Hey, 15 more minutes to wait.
[151:37.04]That's funny.
[151:38.78]Okay.
[151:40.70]Well.
[151:43.86]Back to Nancy Drew.
[151:48.28]Oh, right.
[151:48.71]I'm going to BRB.
[151:50.17]It's a good time to BRB.
[151:53.49]I'm going to come back.
[151:53.95]I'm going to talk about Grotto Beasts very, very quickly.
[151:56.15]A couple things to let you know.
[152:01.24]Very interesting things.
[152:03.54]I will be right back.
[152:09.52]Just a second.
[152:10.16]Let me do this for a second.
[152:11.93]Hold on.
[152:26.97]Okay.
[152:27.27]I'll be right back.
[152:33.03]I'll be right back
[156:44.64]Okay, let's see.
[156:45.58]Let's see if this works.
[156:48.00]Might not work that well, because I'm trying to, uh... Holly and I have been trying to, like, charge it with a little light.
[156:54.13]Uh, let's see.
[157:03.09]Uh, I turned my monitors off, so I can't see you.
[157:06.83]Hold on.
[157:17.59]Alright, I gotta turn this off.
[157:18.29]Let's see if it works.
[157:26.25]Can you see it?
[157:29.63]This is the glow in the dark.
[157:35.83]I got one of the hoodies!
[157:41.74]It probably works better if you charge it in like actual light light, like sunlight.
[157:46.94]That's cool.
[157:49.82]What if I do this?
[157:55.26]This is scary.
[157:58.19]Ready?
[157:58.45]I'm going to turn everything off.
[158:00.23]I'm going to stand over there.
[158:00.95]Let's see if it works.
[158:05.13]Can you see me?
[158:14.18]The camera might not be able to pick it up.
[158:27.86]Ow!
[158:28.62]Fuck!
[158:30.30]I just hit my knee so hard!
[158:36.19]Can you see it?
[158:38.93]I can't even tell if you can see it.
[158:47.36]Alright, I need to see chat.
[158:53.16]You can't see it?
[158:53.96]Shit!
[158:58.15]We were trying to charge it with this little light.
[159:03.49]It comes up pretty well.
[159:08.26]Bro, get a flashlight.
[159:10.52]Hold on, let me see.
[159:15.26]Usually need some intense sunlight.
[159:17.94]Hold on.
[159:18.22]I got this little thing here.
[159:24.42]I wanted to show it earlier with the sunlight, but I kind of couldn't.
[159:28.34]Because you can't really turn the sun off.
[159:32.60]How do I do this?
[159:34.05]I got these little things.
[159:34.99]Alright, ready?
[159:39.83]This is like a seance.
[159:41.05]I don't like this.
[159:42.19]I'm like, yes!
[159:43.23]Alright, ready?
[159:48.60]These are not that bright, unfortunately.
[159:58.36]Oh, is there another solution?
[160:00.78]Hold on.
[160:02.31]Wait, hello?
[160:07.91]No, you're good.
[160:11.77]Oh, Grotto Beasts, I see you.
[160:13.60]Welcome.
[160:14.90]These things are cool.
[160:18.34]Well, I can't really show that well, unfortunately.
[160:20.22]I thought maybe it would work.
[160:24.35]Unfortunately, it's too dark out.
[160:29.34]I can see it pretty well, but it's not coming through the camera that good.
[160:41.56]You need UV light?
[160:46.02]Still cool.
[160:49.04]I mean, it's glowing, but just not that brightly.
[160:50.96]Yeah, I'll turn the light on so you can see.
[161:03.86]Here's one of the shirts.
[161:14.21]I think it came out pretty good.
[161:16.01]Turn the light back off?
[161:18.65]This is a large, by the way.
[161:20.95]Wait, let me turn this on.
[161:28.40]Hey, there we go.
[161:30.46]So you can see the color better.
[161:35.19]This is a man-sized hoodie, that's right.
[161:39.15]Do we have maybe like a UV light?
[161:42.99]So, me and Holly played around with these.
[161:46.01]We got it to work before.
[161:47.69]But it was daytime, so that makes sense.
[161:51.36]It's a comfy hoodie, it is.
[161:52.90]Well, this is a large.
[161:54.60]So, I usually wear mediums.
[161:57.32]Somebody said he's so ugly.
[161:59.94]Shut up.
[162:06.76]Use your phone?
[162:07.57]If you have a blacklight.
[162:11.66]Why do you look so sweaty?
[162:12.50]Because I am sweaty.
[162:14.12]Oh, let me try something.
[162:15.36]I'll be right back.
[164:31.00]There we go.
[164:31.60]Alright, there it is.
[164:32.41]Wait, why am I here somewhere twice?
[164:37.17]Okay, hold on.
[164:45.17]So the phone light works much better than just like a regular light.
[164:48.40]I wonder why.
[164:49.84]Yeah, this is cool.
[164:50.56]Alright.
[164:50.84]Yeah, let's do it.
[164:51.54]Let's see.
[164:51.88]You ready?
[164:54.86]I got to turn all my monitors off.
[165:03.16]Okay, here it comes.
[165:05.72]Should be able to see it now.
[165:20.28]Yeah!
[165:20.86]There it is!
[165:21.34]Can you see it?
[165:31.71]It works!
[165:41.12]Can you see it?
[165:41.70]Is it being picked up by the camera?
[165:44.34]Because it looks great here.
[165:45.24]I don't know if you guys can see it or not.
[165:56.83]You can't see.
[165:57.81]Fuck.
[165:59.65]Well, I assure you it looks really cool.
[166:04.97]We can't see anything?
[166:06.11]It's the camera.
[166:06.89]The camera's not good enough.
[166:08.61]We'll take a photo of it.
[166:12.15]Yeah, you can see it now, but... I think the camera's not good enough to pick up the light.
[166:20.52]We believe you.
[166:24.02]I promise it closed!
[166:25.17]I promise!
[166:25.77]Alright, give me one second.
[166:30.95]I think there's too much light in here.
[166:36.76]Diver truck brick demo.
[166:39.58]No, I swear to God, it is glowing.
[166:41.56]It's just not picking up well on camera.
[166:53.61]There we go.
[167:02.03]Okay.
[167:04.05]Hold on.
[167:04.71]Alright, I'm going to go pee.
[167:05.72]I'll be right back.
[169:08.93]Okay.
[169:11.99]Well, I wish it showed up.
[169:16.35]We'll take a picture with it so we can prove it actually works.
[169:24.21]You didn't just piss?
[169:24.91]Yes, I did.
[169:25.29]Hi.
[169:36.22]I think the issue is that
[169:39.22]Trying to just blast it with like a flashlight and then stand in the corner with a webcam probably doesn't show it that well.
[169:46.78]We'll take a picture.
[169:48.72]After stream, we'll light it up.
[169:50.66]I'll get into a dark room so you can see it.
[169:53.63]It actually is pretty awesome.
[169:56.79]But anyways, the brick went through the cyber truck.
[169:58.87]Sorry about that.
[170:02.79]Keep the blue lighting?
[170:08.91]I missed the Reddit shelf.
[170:10.91]It's okay.
[170:11.19]Alright.
[170:14.65]This will take two minutes.
[170:16.81]Well, it was supposed to take two minutes.
[170:18.02]Uh, also, hey, let me show this.
[170:22.38]Wait.
[170:28.48]Let me just get into Diablo first.
[170:31.45]What's my hair routine?
[170:32.55]Uh, it's called use a decent conditioner.
[170:39.98]Don't overwash.
[170:43.16]Don't sit there and just scrub your head for too long.
[170:51.12]Okay.
[170:51.30]Let me do this.
[170:57.64]Nancy Drew is okay.
[171:00.24]She'll be fine.
[171:00.78]Another thing I want to show you real quick.
[171:08.04]We've been getting lots of questions about the rules of the game.
[171:12.30]Because I'm sure a lot of you understand that it's channel merch first, but on top of that, it's also a game.
[171:22.70]And people saying, how does this gameplay?
[171:25.00]What the hell are you even doing?
[171:28.02]Is this like, is this like magic or Pokémon or Yu-Gi-Oh?
[171:32.42]Like, what can I compare this to?
[171:34.37]And we haven't really given any rules.
[171:37.10]So, the game designer has put together a quick start video and is ready to watch.
[171:47.92]We're going to link it into the chat room if you want to see how the game is played.
[171:58.93]Why is that person's name glowing?
[172:00.99]What was that?
[172:03.09]That person's name is literally glowing in the chat.
[172:06.05]What was that?
[172:07.43]I can't even find it anymore.
[172:08.37]Am I going crazy?
[172:11.13]What was that?
[172:17.34]Somebody's name was glowing!
[172:21.42]But yeah.
[172:22.30]We got a video.
[172:24.62]GrottoBeast, on the GrottoBeast YouTube.
[172:27.16]They'll be unlisting it.
[172:28.22]They'll be showing it.
[172:31.66]Probably get a link here in a second.
[172:40.03]Maybe.
[172:41.37]Possible.
[172:45.93]Possibly.
[172:48.80]Eventually.
[172:50.96]They went offline.
[172:56.78]There he is again.
[172:57.30]There he is again.
[173:02.18]Stop talking.
[173:02.76]I want to see what they're doing.
[173:07.01]But anyways, here is the quick start guide.
[173:09.69]It's only about, it's less than 10 minutes.
[173:11.71]This is not the entire rules of the game.
[173:14.21]This is just telling you how it's played.
[173:16.69]It's showing you some basic tutorials of how it works.
[173:19.93]This is from our game designer.
[173:21.39]It's on the Grotto Beasts YouTube right now.
[173:26.56]Here is the video in question.
[173:29.58]The rules...
[173:33.79]And the FAQ will be up on the site very soon, probably in the next two or three days.
[173:40.09]But for those of you that want to know exactly what the hell the game portion is, there it is.
[173:46.20]Give you a pretty good idea of how it works.
[173:50.76]And two minutes is up.
[173:53.08]Glad it was a two-minute Grotto Beasts talk.
[174:01.19]And from there...
[174:03.37]Also, keep in mind, some of that merch, the actual apparel, like the shirts and stuff, is leaving the store soon.
[174:13.01]That glow-in-the-dark hoodie, I promise I prove that it'll work.
[174:18.63]This webcam just sucks.
[174:21.59]That is going off the store, I believe, a couple of days, we moved it up until like the second or third of April.
[174:34.87]We gave like two or three more days.
[174:36.49]It was going to be March 31st, but now it's like April 2nd, April 3rd.
[174:49.40]I believe the original 40 shirt, the posters, and the glow-in-the-dark shirt are all leaving the store.
[174:58.08]as of the 2nd or 3rd of April.
[174:59.90]So, if you want to watch the video, the quick start guide is there.
[175:02.62]The game portion of the, uh, and that's, there is the two minutes.
[175:04.86]Took about 20.
[175:08.58]Very, very cool.
[175:16.17]Thanks for postponing this just for my birthday.
[175:17.87]Alright.
[175:25.07]This is the glowing guy.
[175:26.47]Ugh.
[175:30.08]Did it even show up at all?
[175:31.42]Could you even see it?
[175:31.96]Because it was showing up in real life.
[175:33.96]That's unfortunate.
[175:34.74]Oh well.
[175:40.29]Alright, let's get back to Diablo.
[175:56.71]You were having a vision.
[176:03.19]Is Nancy Drist still open?
[176:05.15]I think it is.
[176:05.53]Okay, there we go.
[176:16.28]Alright.
[176:18.60]Missed my camera.
[176:19.74]There it is.
[176:21.18]I look a little sweaty.
[176:25.50]Alright.
[176:26.76]For the inevitable next crash, I'm ready.
[176:29.80]We have the fossil in view.
[176:34.22]I didn't even get a water.
[176:35.62]Shit.
[176:38.02]I'll BRB in like 10 more minutes.
[176:42.96]Is this fun?
[176:43.54]I can't tell you.
[176:47.50]I can't tell you.
[176:52.80]I'm not allowed to tell you.
[176:56.46]Maybe in an hour or two I will give you my real opinions.
[177:00.26]I'll give you my real thoughts.
[177:07.54]Didn't I already talk to him?
[177:08.30]Oh, it's because the game crashed.
[177:10.44]Right, right, right, right, right.
[177:11.16]Alright, here we go.
[177:13.30]You hate the game?
[177:14.18]Stop saying that.
[177:14.92]It's going to make me look bad.
[177:16.30]I'm enjoying it so far.
[177:37.64]Ah, so the old man's finally decided to fight back.
[177:40.26]And you rush me to level 3?
[177:42.57]Knowing him, he didn't mention coin, did he?
[177:48.99]If he wants his weapon, you will need to pay.
[177:51.73]Okay.
[177:59.80]Lorath's polearm.
[178:01.10]This shit was 20 bucks.
[178:02.98]How is that cheaper?
[178:03.80]This is kind of embarrassing.
[178:07.38]20 cents and the next thing you got is 1500.
[178:08.86]That's kind of fucked up.
[178:17.23]Okay.
[178:38.14]Strange amulet.
[178:55.59]What is Nancy's funeral?
[178:58.63]Apologies.
[179:01.36]He also gave me this amulet.
[179:04.12]What is it?
[179:05.54]The mark of the Haradrim.
[179:08.43]An ancient order of scholars and mages.
[179:11.64]Sworn to protect sanctuary from demons.
[179:15.30]These days, we are few in number.
[179:18.44]This game should have a hypothermia meter.
[179:22.48]His breadth of knowledge of our demons is equal only to his hubris.
[179:30.95]Sounds like he could help us.
[179:34.74]You should seek him out in Scotland.
[179:37.59]But don't forget about the cathedral.
[179:39.29]Don't be expecting him, and they might prove to be useful allies too.
[179:43.53]You're not coming with me.
[179:46.05]I'm going to the Dry Steps to find out who that pale man is.
[179:49.80]Join me when you can, just be careful.
[179:53.72]Your ties to Lilith, the visions you see, you are the key to finding her and stopping whatever she has planned.
[180:03.70]There it is.
[180:08.92]Sometimes our paths in life are set to collide.
[180:13.38]We just don't know it.
[180:16.95]Whether it is by accident or fate's hand, there is nothing we can do about it.
[180:23.97]The wanderer lost in the storm, fed the blood of Lilith, saved by a lone monk,
[180:34.98]Different lives and incidents drawn together.
[180:39.05]By what?
[180:40.89]I like listening to this voice.
[180:44.21]I want this guy to read a book.
[180:45.03]Or something greater power pulling the strings.
[180:49.29]I did not know.
[180:53.46]But at the time, I thought I had the chance to protect humanity from the daughter of hatred.
[181:02.92]The wanderers connection to her gave me hope.
[181:07.86]Imagine that.
[181:12.96]OK.
[181:23.51]So now this is like the hey, the world is opened up now.
[181:25.99]Go pretty much everywhere.
[181:27.45]OK.
[181:36.98]oh this is like hey you're almost at the end of the demo like Mario's about to pop in and be like that's enough next player please okay locations tab you purchased items you have a wardrobe alright okay so you can buy emotes wait is that it
[182:00.95]Oh, I thought that actually was the end of the beta.
[182:03.48]I was like, that's not right, right?
[182:05.28]I was like, hold on a minute.
[182:06.80]What's happening?
[182:08.14]I thought I just got Mario'd.
[182:09.44]I really thought that's what just happened.
[182:11.22]Okay, we're good.
[182:13.96]Aren't I in the beta right now?
[182:17.70]Okay, we're good.
[182:26.36]Okay.
[182:28.43]Open your journal to view active quests.
[182:32.97]Not Q. Okay.
[182:44.38]Travel to the Cathedral of Light.
[182:45.90]I think that's the one I'm going to do.
[182:47.26]Pin activities on the map with right click.
[182:55.11]Okay.
[182:55.29]I think it already is pinned, right?
[182:59.73]That is.
[183:09.47]Should I do this?
[183:10.05]I mean, do I really need to?
[183:11.19]I probably shouldn't even do these.
[183:12.09]Beta's probably going to get shut off anyway.
[183:15.59]I wonder if this progress goes through the beta.
[183:16.81]I doubt it.
[183:17.13]It doesn't.
[183:17.43]Okay.
[183:17.57]Yeah, we'll just do the main thing then.
[183:53.60]why does cilantro taste like soap um cilantro is good I think aren't there certain people that have like a genetic code in their body that makes it so it tastes gross to them
[184:06.14]We were born in sin.
[184:08.94]Children of darkness.
[184:12.07]But the Father's light can be sought through penitence and faith.
[184:19.45]Walk in the light.
[184:24.80]We must be ever vigilant against sin, brother.
[184:28.11]Yes, Reverend Mother.
[184:29.69]Let the light of Inarius burn away wickedness.
[184:33.63]Let not temptation lead you from his holy radiance.
[184:37.11]Let righteousness seal away corruption and sin.
[184:40.53]Cast out thy darkness, for only light must remain.
[184:45.27]Cast out thy darkness, for only light must remain.
[184:50.31]Is this the one from Nevest?
[184:52.77]Yes, Reverend Mother.
[184:55.43]Did Lorath not accompany you?
[184:58.21]He sent me on without him.
[185:00.73]Putting faith in that old man was a mistake.
[185:03.91]What could possibly be of greater import?
[185:08.47]Lilith.
[185:10.88]So... ...you know.
[185:12.26]Hm.
[185:18.09]We have received word from one of our knights of a demon sighting in Gale Valley.
[185:23.87]The description matches too closely to the sighting in the vest.
[185:27.40]I can't really alt-tab yet.
[185:28.74]Let's see what people send.
[185:30.24]And take stock of events there.
[185:33.12]You would have the gratitude of the Cathedral of Light.
[185:37.36]I had thought to send Lorath, but... Again, he fails in his duty.
[185:43.07]With or without Lorath.
[185:45.65]The will of Inarius shall be done.
[185:56.04]Here, take the knight's report before you go.
[186:00.61]Let's go.

[186:34.91]Oh
[186:36.60]Tell your grandma to stop fucking screaming awful shit in the chat then.
[186:52.97]Based granny.
[186:56.05]Open up your granny's chat logs and see like the wacky ass shit granny's been saying.
[187:04.25]So 72% say it tastes good.
[187:08.92]That's a lot of people that said it tastes awful.
[187:10.36]28%.
[187:13.20]That seems kind of high, doesn't it?
[187:32.89]I'm out of mana.
[187:42.32]You don't have to have the gene to not like Solange.
[187:44.80]That's true.
[187:45.98]That's true.
[187:48.08]I'm low on precious mana.
[187:50.60]Which is hurting bad.
[187:52.18]Definitely helps, though.
[188:08.52]I lack the needed mana.
[188:19.06]Hog wizard gameplay?
[188:24.84]I wonder how many people are playing as the other classes.
[188:27.97]Don't kill the animals.
[188:44.82]Event joined.
[188:45.74]Caravan under siege.
[188:47.10]Slay the enemies.
[188:48.08]Oh, okay.
[188:54.48]How much time?
[189:02.42]Oh, it's like a minute.
[189:23.15]Am I destroying the caravans accidentally?
[189:25.48]No.
[189:26.92]Oh, shit.
[189:31.88]I'm not quite prepared for this.
[189:45.09]Shit, I should have bought two more spells.
[189:47.68]I'm low on precious metal.
[189:53.56]I'm taking a lighter and just going like click click click I do not have any potion oh my god come on man

[190:28.84]Ooh, I got some orbs.
[190:39.12]Gain oboes by completing events and spend them at... Okay, so that's cool.
[190:43.67]So that's how you get those.
[190:44.45]I got a rare.
[190:57.50]Stop biting your lip.
[191:01.43]Hold, Shadow Resist, five decks.
[191:16.32]Boring Barry?
[191:22.09]Boring Barry, should I continue?
[191:23.57]Boring Barry?
[191:31.43]I'm doing it.
[191:37.55]It's just too much damage to not do it.
[191:58.40]Where's Nancy?
[192:00.36]Nancy only appears when there's a problem with this game.
[192:04.38]And it's been pretty frequent, so I'm sure we'll check in with her soon.
[192:29.72]Am I not allowed down here?
[192:44.95]Is the winds blowing too far?
[192:48.29]The winds are blowing.
[192:49.25]How do I stop the wind from blowing?
[193:03.89]Oh, it's not supposed to be happening.
[193:15.19]Uh... Nancy?
[193:21.92]How are ya?
[193:28.20]Nancy?
[193:37.74]Alright, let me go.
[193:38.22]I'm going to get some water.
[193:38.98]I'll be right back.
[193:41.63]We'll get Nancy up here and I'm going to give me one second.
[193:43.95]I'm going to let me get some water.
[198:53.61]Hello.
[198:55.89]Sorry, I had to redo my queue.
[198:58.72]Okay.
[199:03.18]Hello!
[199:03.54]So where were we?
[199:12.81]Nancy and I... ...were digging up fossils.
[199:20.98]Oh shit, this ha- no.
[199:23.56]No, we're good.
[199:24.00]We're good.
[199:27.07]Okay.
[199:27.21]Do I have to take a picture of this or no?
[199:30.57]Should I go back and tell them that the dog is real?
[199:37.62]I don't think so.
[199:52.05]Is this like a sprint back and yell like, the dog is real, the dog is real.
[199:57.97]Did they believe us?
[200:04.34]The dog is real.
[200:05.62]Yeah, that might make you look a little weird.
[200:28.56]Did I even get any items or anything?
[200:33.00]It's like lunchtime, right?
[200:35.67]Ah, warm again.
[200:41.11]They were the two guys playing that chess game or whatever it was, right?
[200:47.51]Where were those guys?
[200:58.39]Because they were like, oh, I gotta make burgers?
[201:09.52]Avoid overcooking anything on the griddle or in a frying pan.
[201:12.12]Fire may result.
[201:14.90]Guests may order French toast and omelet or Canadian bacon.
[201:18.24]French toast and Canadian bacon should be cooked on the griddle.
[201:20.72]Omelet, well, it's not breakfast anymore.
[201:22.24]It's lunch.
[201:30.44]Hamburgers or quesadilla.
[201:32.14]Put hamburger patties on the griddle and remove them from the griddle when they are dark brown to ensure that they have been thoroughly cooked.
[201:37.24]Okay.
[201:39.38]Put the cooked hamburger patty on the bun first and any extra ingredients.
[201:46.73]Dark brown.
[201:47.93]Put it down first, then any extras.
[201:50.07]Quesadilla.
[201:50.63]Put the tortilla into which cheese has already been folded.
[201:55.27]In a frying pan.
[201:56.37]Never on the griddle.
[201:58.23]Remove the quesadilla from the pan when it has been lightly browned.
[202:03.29]Okay.
[202:05.13]Put it in the frying pan.
[202:05.85]Don't... And just remove it when it's been browned.
[202:09.72]Alright.
[202:10.30]Are you ordering food or what?
[202:13.38]You want a quesadilla and one hamburger.
[202:15.66]What?
[202:18.54]What?
[202:22.79]Oh, shit.
[202:23.31]Sorry.
[202:23.57]I handed you an empty plate.
[202:25.50]Alright.
[202:27.08]You don't... You want one hamburger, two cheese, one lettuce, two pickle, one tomato, onion... Wait, is this... Okay, you want two... Two cheese, one lettuce, two pickle, one tomato.
[202:39.10]Two cheese, one... Two cheese... Two cheese, one lettuce, two pickle...
[202:54.21]Two cheese.
[202:57.49]Now what?
[202:58.77]Where do I put it?
[202:59.27]Where do I put it?
[203:01.41]Where did I just put that meat?
[203:03.68]What did I do?
[203:04.30]Oh, okay.
[203:04.86]Well, somebody's going to find that at some point.
[203:07.30]How do I put it on a plate?
[203:12.73]Two cheese.
[203:13.39]Oh, boy.
[203:18.37]Son of a, God damn it.
[203:20.91]I, alright.
[203:21.83]I thought I was looking for a plate.
[203:23.17]I didn't, I thought, alright.
[203:24.68]Two cheese.
[203:28.44]One lettuce.
[203:31.68]Two pickle, one tomato.
[203:39.54]And then ketchup.
[203:50.35]It looks like fucking dog shit.
[203:53.43]Order up!
[203:58.37]Alright, you just want a quesadilla.
[204:03.58]You want anything on it?
[204:06.10]No.
[204:12.36]Order up!
[204:14.62]One quesadilla.
[204:27.32]one two cheese alright um
[204:56.70]Hamburger patties, like, in the onion tray.
[204:59.36]The person should be like, alright, you're trolling the restaurant, you're fired.
[205:02.00]Like, stop.
[205:03.44]Like, why did you do that?
[205:04.94]I don't know, I thought it was funny for the internet.
[205:06.55]Alright, well, sorry, but, like, what the hell are you doing?
[205:11.67]It's been buried at the bottom.
[205:15.73]Alright, what do you want on these?
[205:18.52]Cheese, lettuce, pickles.
[205:24.67]Shit!
[205:25.91]Nope, this one's two cheese, two lettuce, one pickle.
[205:31.50]One tomato, two onion.
[205:32.54]Okay.
[205:37.36]One ketchup.
[205:44.28]Order up!
[205:46.36]Two cheese, one lettuce, two pickle.
[205:53.98]One tomato, mustard, ketchup.
[206:04.53]Order up.
[206:06.03]Then you want two things.
[206:07.03]You want one burger, one quesadilla.
[206:09.77]One cheese, two pickle, one tomato.
[206:17.68]One mustard, mustard, ketchup.
[206:23.49]And a quesadilla.
[206:25.05]This one's for me.
[206:32.15]That easy.
[206:57.48]Hey, there we go I'm low on precious mana
[207:21.12]Bro, what?
[207:22.74]Anytime I'm in a queue for Diablo 4, I play Nancy Drew.
[207:29.19]Out of mana once again.
[207:38.91]I'm going to play Nancy Drew though.
[207:40.69]I'm feeling that right now.
[207:53.69]Alright, let me get to the end of this, and we'll go back to Naziru for a little bit.
[208:15.18]I do like this, though.
[208:16.14]I probably... This would probably be, like... Probably play this, like, on a chill stream.
[208:20.75]When it actually releases, or maybe next week or something.
[208:23.43]What do you need?
[208:24.07]Because I actually do like it.
[208:27.15]I'm looking for Viggo.
[208:29.55]You and that nuisance of a child both.
[208:32.60]Girl's been nagging us about that demon woman all week.
[208:36.62]Viggo's gone, looking into her claims.
[208:39.28]He should be at the mining camp north of here.
[208:42.96]All escort of knights went missing there last week.
[208:46.36]Play Grim Dawn.
[208:49.57]I played Grim Dawn when it was in early access up to, I believe, Act 3.
[208:55.85]I played it a long time ago.
[209:08.86]Waypoint.
[209:14.21]This map is actually really big.
[209:17.68]I wonder if it's just this or if there's any more.
[209:19.04]This is actually pretty large.
[209:24.54]Pretty cool.
[209:41.93]Uh, I can't wait.
[209:42.93]Can I afford this?
[209:47.75]Not much.
[209:57.43]Go to the mining camp.
[209:58.31]Let me see what these things are.
[210:01.75]I provide a steady supply of, shall we say, specimens for the clergy nearby.
[210:07.88]However, the desire for knowledge has become more dangerous to satisfy.
[210:14.21]I require a host of intact ghoul hearts from the surrounding area.
[210:19.27]There's something special about the ravenous dead nearby.
[210:22.92]I don't know what happened Better
[210:53.44]Cool.
[210:55.94]Yeah, let me just do this next little arc and we'll go back to Nancy Drew.
[211:16.49]Stay in Diablo?
[211:17.28]Yeah, I don't know.
[211:20.80]I'm down for pretty much anything.
[211:23.10]We'll see how this goes.
[211:23.84]I am enjoying playing this.
[211:32.67]Cool hearts.
[211:36.35]Indecisive?
[211:37.41]That's literally my entire life.
[211:40.84]My whole life is being indecisive of things.
[211:52.05]What's that?
[211:58.81]Offhand?
[211:59.13]I think the staff is better.
[212:21.41]We got a great hairline.
[212:23.11]Well, the thing about hairlines is what they change every five to seven years, right?
[212:29.43]At least that's what I've been told.
[212:32.60]You notice a difference every five to ten years.
[212:37.16]So if it stays like this for like five to ten years, I'm happy with that.
[212:42.62]Although at what point of the cycle am I in, right?
[212:47.35]Am I at the end of the ten years or am I at the beginning of a new ten years?
[212:52.20]For a hairline.
[212:52.62]For what your hairline looks like.
[212:54.30]That's the question.
[212:55.72]Could be the end.
[213:10.77]Oh.
[213:11.43]I lack the needed magic.
[213:15.70]That's a cool shrine.
[213:18.74]Dude, your roots are holding on for dear life.
[213:20.96]You're definitely at the end of the cycle.
[213:30.75]More strangers in the camp.
[213:41.97]Ooh, iron.
[213:45.57]Your roots are hanging on.
[213:48.46]Well, I think they're fine for a little another while at least.
[213:51.39]I don't know.
[213:53.77]What's that?
[214:08.77]like a beast.
[214:10.09]Strolled right past where you stand.
[214:11.55]This is a loud.
[214:13.37]I think my mother's trapped in there with her.
[214:16.96]You let my mother through, sir.
[214:18.88]Shouldn't you be responsible for her safety?
[214:23.18]We have soldiers stationed inside.
[214:25.12]You should be worried about them, too.
[214:26.72]Did I fuck this up?
[214:31.68]Maybe you can help me.
[214:37.29]I think it's because... Alright, we have to fix this.
[214:44.99]The pots and pans are louder than the people.
[214:47.03]I think it's because I have the... This is all fucked up.
[214:50.58]Hello.
[214:54.00]There we go.
[214:59.06]Mines are closed on church orders.
[215:01.20]They're not safe.
[215:02.98]Especially not for children.
[215:06.05]Ugh.
[215:12.84]She did.
[215:14.64]The horned woman is the demon Lilith.
[215:20.82]No, that can't be.
[215:24.60]My mother taught me that name.
[215:27.54]You speak of the Daughter of Hatred.
[215:31.04]Did Frava mention me?
[215:33.59]She wasn't angry, was she?
[215:36.27]There's more than your job at stake here.
[215:43.67]Let's go.
[215:44.15]What's my shirt say?
[215:54.37]It's the Star Wars periodic table.
[216:09.59]I like it.
[216:19.32]The damn hoist is stuck.
[216:21.80]We've got to go on foot.
[216:25.84]Look out.
[216:34.75]Level up.
[216:36.15]Hey, that's my mother's charm on your wrist.
[216:40.51]Ooh, wait a minute.
[216:48.55]Engulf yourself in flames for two seconds.
[216:50.09]Burning surrounding enemies for 18 damage per second.
[216:55.42]20 second cooldown.
[216:59.96]That seems kind of good, though.
[217:07.01]18 damage a second.
[217:10.03]I mean, that's like 40 damage over two seconds.
[217:22.44]This is a heal.
[217:23.50]Self heal.
[217:27.88]Teleport is always good.
[217:28.93]I kind of like this.
[217:42.79]Frost Nova.
[217:43.39]I think I'm just going to do this.
[217:44.27]Just be damage.
[218:03.28]Two spell, Andy.
[218:05.60]I know, but it does so much damage.
[218:07.60]I'm destroying stuff.
[218:14.42]Hey, look, if you want to... The person that has to go like... Ice Lance!
[218:19.76]And then... Electrical Pulse!
[218:24.03]Dash!
[218:24.73]And then... Machine Gun!
[218:27.31]No, I just go like this and I do the same amount of damage that you did.
[218:40.78]I just go like this.
[218:43.91]And motherfuckers explode.
[218:50.79]But you have less fun.
[218:54.93]Who said I was having less fun?
[218:57.49]I kill people in one hit.
[218:59.39]They die in one hit.
[219:14.30]He's having no fun.
[219:16.98]He's talking... Whatever.
[219:22.10]Alright, we're playing.
[219:25.34]Your face says you're not having fun.
[219:27.22]Ha!
[219:27.64]What are you talking about?
[219:37.99]Yeah, I don't know.
[219:38.59]I only have two moves.
[219:41.90]And one of them is here.
[219:44.14]Really, I should just take this off the bar, right?
[219:46.20]Because I'm not really doing it.
[219:49.35]One move.
[219:50.79]Maybe we should go back.
[219:53.71]Round up the knights.
[219:55.77]Hey, nobody complains to Cyclops when he takes his glasses off.
[220:01.69]Cyclops.
[220:03.95]I mean, you should do something else.
[220:07.12]Why?
[220:09.20]Out of mana once again.
[220:16.43]What do you mean, what?
[220:22.09]What do you mean, what?
[220:22.89]Cyclops takes his glasses off and he has red beams come out of his eyes.
[220:26.85]That's all he has.
[220:27.75]That's what he does.
[220:29.24]He just goes... And it's like, holy shit, dude.
[220:33.46]He's annihilated the whole room.
[220:35.16]Nice job.
[220:35.66]A dead end.
[220:50.01]Bro, you're on to nothing.
[220:51.83]Cyclops has the glasses that kind of constricts his eyes to make it so the laser beams don't come off.
[220:57.99]And he takes the glasses off and he... I've seen every... Cyclops is like my favorite character in Marvel.
[221:03.64]Besides Spider-Man.
[221:05.36]And Wolverine.
[221:07.90]And... I don't know.
[221:16.44]What is Cyclops' name?
[221:34.39]real fan yeah I didn't even have to even type that one on the second monitor
[221:44.78]What happened?
[221:45.56]Cyclops was never given a chance to level up and pick a new skill.
[221:51.61]That's fair.
[222:17.62]I'm low on precious mana.
[222:20.67]Alright, but hold on a minute.
[222:22.03]Why are you assuming that Cyclops, Scott Cyclops, would pick, like, Ice Bolt?
[222:31.57]No, he would just be like, wait a minute, the thing that I already know how to do, the thing I already know what's happening, the thing I already have been used to, I can just make it do 20% more damage.
[222:41.38]Who's picking that one?
[222:59.40]Itchy ear.
[223:32.01]What is the... What's special about this place anyway?
[223:35.04]What would draw Lilith here?
[223:36.48]What's the level cap in the beta?
[223:38.24]Hell if I know.
[223:39.04]Is there one?
[223:39.84]The cover doesn't tell us anything.
[223:41.76]No one goes in, nothing comes out.
[223:44.28]That's all.
[223:44.76]25.
[223:55.37]He goes, no longer following you.
[223:56.53]They're not following me anymore.
[223:58.47]No lift.
[223:59.91]The jam must be deeper down.
[224:02.11]Does he like it?
[224:02.73]I do.
[224:02.97]The thing about a game like this, though, is going through the story and going through the game progression, it's enjoyable.
[224:13.00]It's fun.
[224:13.60]It's kind of just relaxing to play, right?
[224:17.22]But the real test, if this game is any good, is 12 hours from now.
[224:24.56]20 hours from now.
[224:26.29]I think that's how you really tell if a game like this is any fun, for real.
[224:30.11]Because that's where the loot, you go find the certain gear and do the high-level bosses and the dungeons and is that fun.
[224:39.86]It's hard to say, oh wow, Diablo 4, this is fantastic.
[224:43.28]I kind of don't know until you have to play it.
[224:46.55]I think there's enough time that you have to pass for you to experience at least the part of the game that I want to experience.
[224:53.59]My favorite part about Diablo II was just opening up the Mephisto loot box.
[225:11.24]That was my favorite thing to do.
[225:12.34]I loved the item hunt.
[225:14.12]That was the best part for me.
[225:22.66]God.
[225:36.19]My favorite part about Diablo 4 is Nancy Drew.
[225:38.75]Out of mana once again.
[225:41.28]That's a pretty good part as well.
[225:46.98]Your favorite part about Diablo was loot boxes?
[225:51.25]I mean, kind of.
[225:55.15]Killing Mephisto or killing Diablo was, you know, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[225:59.95]There's the, okay, two greens, a yellow, and ah, there's no unique.
[226:05.03]That's alright, but cool.
[226:05.87]What's the set though?
[226:06.61]It's just fun to do.
[226:12.58]And then trading was kind of fun too.
[226:14.30]Being able to be like, oh, I got this and this is kind of fun.
[226:16.04]I can trade this.
[226:21.76]That's a huge part of why I feel like a lot of people played the old Diablo games.
[226:32.17]I liked collecting stuff, too.
[226:33.87]Every time I made a character in Old Diablo, I always had to have a... I'd have, like, three or four other characters just to hold perfect topazes.
[226:44.88]I would never use them.
[226:45.74]I just wanted to have them.
[226:46.94]You'd have, like, 20 rows of... Ding!
[226:49.70]Ding!
[226:50.68]Ding!
[226:51.64]Ding!
[226:52.04]Just perfect skulls, perfect topazes, perfect emeralds.
[226:56.38]It's fun to collect.
[226:57.12]It was a collecting game for me.
[227:03.02]That was quick thinking.
[227:06.98]You freak hoarder.
[227:09.18]You hoarder.
[227:10.76]It's Diablo.
[227:16.90]Why would your mother leave you like that?
[227:20.98]She wouldn't.
[227:22.76]Or she shouldn't have.
[227:24.68]I really was like a little loot goblin.
[227:26.06]Just having like the sack over my shoulder.
[227:27.78]Like...
[227:39.33]Oh, you're looking for perfect skulls?
[227:41.05]I've got plenty of those.
[227:50.50]Identifying an item was always cool too.
[227:52.16]I don't know how many people don't know how Diablo really works or... I don't even know how it works in this game because I haven't really found one yet, but...
[228:03.48]Getting an item that you know was potentially really cool and needing to have that second step of, alright, what is it?
[228:12.86]Or what are the roles on it?
[228:16.55]What's the enhanced defense role?
[228:18.03]What's the enhanced damage role?
[228:19.69]Enhanced damage role, this is a big deal.
[228:22.01]What is it?
[228:22.43]It was fun.
[228:26.05]Now, I don't love wild RNG.
[228:31.45]One of my favorite parts about D2 is the unique items.
[228:33.95]I know you're going to spam that.
[228:34.93]It's fine.
[228:35.38]Spam the emote.
[228:37.72]I'm not fucking a chat anymore.
[228:40.80]One of the... Shit.
[228:43.50]Alright.
[228:44.24]One of my favorite parts about Diablo II was that a unique item was the same every time you found it.
[228:50.23]Let's say it was like a unique, like colossal sword, right?
[228:53.71]It was always going to be the grandfather colossal sword, right?
[228:56.07]But when you opened it, when you identified it,
[228:59.88]was a couple of parameters that were random there it was always the same parameter but it was either a good percentage lower or higher right it was always a percentage that was lower or higher and and I and I'm getting food off the stage but you know what I mean
[229:27.18]But an item having 200 to 250% enhanced damage and it rolls a 201 is like a... I'm still going to use this, but no, it sucks, but it's okay because it's still the same item.
[229:45.37]I wasn't a big fan of having everything be random on the item.
[229:48.88]Everything.
[229:49.26]Just be kind of just throw dice in the air.
[229:52.82]But if you rolled like a 240...
[229:55.51]Hey, now you're talking.
[229:57.55]Now you're talking.
[229:58.17]I'm just gonna get up and do this in an open mic night one day.
[230:16.62]This game is cringe.
[230:17.90]Okay.
[230:35.11]Yeah.
[230:36.73]This cringe.
[230:41.92]I'm not ready yet.
[230:47.46]Well, I only have two moves, so it doesn't look cool when I do that.
[230:49.93]But you know what I mean?
[230:50.65]It would have been cool if I had three or four moves.
[230:56.33]I'm not dying here.
[231:03.84]Alright, here we go.
[231:15.19]Get more spells.
[231:18.65]All jokes aside, this is working out pretty fine.
[231:43.68]Flame Shield.
[231:49.94]Charge Bolts is fun.
[231:51.58]At least it was in the other games.
[232:02.07]Upgrade Fireball.
[232:14.67]Mana wouldn't be bad.
[232:26.73]Upgrade Fireball to be more like a hot.
[232:31.76]That is actually really good.
[232:36.12]Bigger radius.
[232:38.88]Yeah.
[232:41.02]If I got five points in this already, then I definitely should just keep going this way.
[232:49.97]Increased based on the distance traveled.
[232:57.05]The tunnels closed.
[232:58.97]We're trapped without the hoist.
[233:02.79]Look, there she is.
[233:06.10]Why do you look at Calvin Klein model like your lips are doing some Zoolander shit tonight?
[233:11.94]I think it's because I'm biting my lip and I'm going like.
[233:14.16]Look, I'm biting my lip.
[233:29.26]Turned the face, came on, and I'm just like... Now he's extra conscious of it.
[233:41.23]Ah, it's alright.
[233:41.67]I don't care.
[233:45.13]I feel like this is going to be a boss.
[233:46.54]And I really want to see what it is.
[233:56.50]My enhanced fireball.
[234:00.07]No filters, no makeup.
[234:01.41]I don't even know how to put one of those on.
[234:07.82]Filter.
[234:33.50]Slain?
[234:34.84]What happened?
[234:35.43]This is on normal.
[234:37.43]This is on the, whatever, tier two, whatever it is.
[234:39.83]Veteran.
[234:42.75]We need reinforcements.
[234:45.09]I would even want to turn it up another one.
[234:47.24]I wonder how many they're going to have at launch.
[234:50.14]What was that?
[234:52.20]It came from beyond the gates.
[235:04.74]This is definitely a boss room.
[235:05.94]Alright, let's do it.
[235:19.25]Over there.
[235:23.28]Who did this?
[235:24.18]A woman.
[235:26.20]Viggo.
[235:29.08]Are they actually difficulty settings or are they bullshit?
[235:36.80]That's a good question.
[235:40.84]I don't know.
[235:41.58]This just makes monsters have more health, right?
[235:44.06]You get more experience.
[235:46.15]I don't know exactly what it does.
[235:48.85]Where is she?
[235:54.27]She begs for her life.
[235:55.33]20% more health.
[235:58.71]Let her deeper in.
[236:02.05]We can take a look.
[236:03.77]Second half.
[236:05.14]She's lost.
[236:05.76]I'm pretty sure you can change it on the fly.
[236:08.34]You must listen.
[236:10.34]Steel did nothing.
[236:13.44]Spells.
[236:14.92]Prayers.
[236:15.98]All useless.
[236:18.16]Go to Korvala.
[236:20.13]Tell Plow... Raise the army... The father... Evil... Itself... Vox Sanctuary... Do... This... For... Me.
[236:38.39]He is dead.
[236:39.01]I'm done for.
[236:42.57]Your mother told me this trinket would bring good fortune.
[236:47.59]To think I trusted her.
[236:50.33]She bribed you with it, didn't she?
[236:53.19]You weren't supposed to let her through at all.
[236:56.77]But it's not too late.
[236:58.17]She can still be saved.
[237:00.81]Not by me.
[237:02.45]Not anymore.
[237:03.84]There it was.
[237:04.48]Prava will know what to do.
[237:07.78]You're leaving us?
[237:09.62]Abandoning her?
[237:10.42]This happened to my buddy Eric, man.
[237:12.02]There's nothing left to abandon.
[237:13.38]Yeah.
[237:15.59]She's good as dead.
[237:17.53]I'm sorry, kid.
[237:18.69]Yeah, my buddy Eric.
[237:20.62]Damn.
[237:20.72]He's bored.
[237:21.20]I'm just playing the game.
[237:25.39]Relax.
[237:25.85]We're actually going to fight Lilith right now, aren't we?
[237:52.41]What is this?
[237:59.18]How your mind races.
[238:02.48]Yes, I am Lilith, Mother of Sanctuary.
[238:09.23]Daughter of Hatred.
[238:11.89]I have what you seek.
[238:15.67]You hunger for knowledge.
[238:17.65]Just water.
[238:18.51]You dragged your child all over Sanctuary in pursuit of it.
[238:24.13]No, I... I taught her how to survive.
[238:28.24]Is that what you want to believe?
[238:32.40]Drop the act.
[238:35.12]You have questions.
[238:37.68]I have answers.
[238:40.86]I know the fabric of the cosmos.
[238:46.43]Everything I've read has warned me against you You've read so much Yet know so little Will you accept my offer no, I I don't know Will you let me try Fucking glasses off your mother is alive She came this way with Lilith
[239:16.26]How can you be sure?
[239:20.68]Sometimes I see visions of the past.
[239:24.65]I saw them.
[239:26.81]What?
[239:27.93]How?
[239:29.59]Lilith's petals.
[239:31.53]Her blood was fed to me once.
[239:34.55]You stupid human.
[239:37.20]I'm immune to the plasma damage that your eyes emit.
[239:42.32]It's too bad, because ice and fire both hurt a lot.
[239:50.65]But it has ten points in it!
[240:05.75]I'm low on precious matter.
[240:12.28]That was too much.
[240:13.28]Oh well.
[240:18.78]Chat is more divided.
[240:23.11]You watched X-Men yesterday, didn't you?
[240:26.97]No.
[240:43.35]I mean, what are we really going to argue that Cyclops didn't have the best grip out of all the X-Men?
[240:50.28]It'd be weird if you were to say that.
[240:53.10]Just drip.
[241:01.55]What are you talking about?
[241:07.03]I said drip, drip, drip.
[241:14.71]Fucked.
[241:29.24]I didn't say grip.
[241:30.32]I said drip.
[241:34.86]Watch the clip.
[241:35.60]Just go download a clip and watch it.
[241:38.59]I didn't say that.
[241:39.39]I said drip.
[241:46.74]I'm going to get out of here.
[241:47.85]I'm going to get out of here for a minute.
[241:58.21]You definitely said... No.
[241:59.72]Give me a clip.
[242:00.52]I want to see it right now.
[242:04.10]Somebody show it to me.
[242:05.04]Link it to me.
[242:05.44]I want to see.
[242:05.78]Prove it to me.
[242:28.37]I didn't do that!
[242:32.03]What?! !
[243:03.44]I mean, what are we really going to argue that Cyclops didn't have the best grip out of all the X-Men?
[243:09.49]It's drip.
[243:10.59]I said drip.
[243:11.67]I swear to you.
[243:12.55]I mean, what are we really going to argue that Cyclops didn't have the best grip out of all the X-Men?
[243:33.87]No, dude!
[243:34.93]It's D!
[243:35.79]I'm telling you, I said D!
[244:03.84]It's the noise gate on here or something.
[244:06.04]Why would I say that?
[244:06.98]I'm talking about his clothes.
[244:08.52]He's got these.
[244:09.08]He's got the blue.
[244:10.40]He's got the yellow.
[244:12.18]It's... It's... It's... I... I... Whatever.
[244:16.95]Who cares?
[244:17.83]Fuck it.
[244:18.51]You know, fuck it.
[244:19.23]Whatever.
[244:19.81]Yeah.
[244:20.25]Cool.
[244:20.55]I don't care.
[244:21.39]Yeah.
[244:23.11]Yeah, we're good.
[244:23.79]We're cool.
[244:24.91]Either way, I don't care.
[244:26.57]Yeah, we're good.
[244:32.38]Fuck it.
[244:32.74]We're still alive.
[244:42.59]It's fine.
[244:47.43]I can't fucking believe it.
[244:48.43]It's funny.
[244:54.25]It literally is the noise gate.
[244:56.58]Well, let them have their fun.
[244:57.48]It's okay.
[245:13.40]Okay, I need to find a deeper way into Kusama.
[245:27.17]This works.
[245:36.88]Rathma.
[245:42.81]Yeah, there.
[245:47.68]Alright, let's go.
[245:53.02]You think you're better than us.
[245:54.14]Just remember, when did I say that?
[246:07.58]Grip gate.
[246:09.36]So curious.
[246:11.66]You are eager to know why you were spared.
[246:16.24]Yes.
[246:18.49]Do you have faith in me?
[246:19.95]Freaking water through a straw is hard to do.
[246:22.41]I want to.
[246:25.57]Good.
[246:26.93]For now.
[246:28.61]All you need know is that we are going to meet my son.
[246:35.13]Rathma.
[246:36.55]The first necromancer.
[246:39.78]I just want to like... You know what I mean?
[246:43.10]Just drink it!
[247:27.82]Okay, so when you drink water, oh my God.
[247:30.92]Alright.
[247:33.36]Drinking water through a straw.
[247:35.40]It's like... I wanted to just... You know what?
[247:41.26]GrottoBeast.net.
[247:43.98]Check it out.
[247:44.46]It's a fun game that we got.
[247:46.00]It's a fun piece of community merchandise.
[247:48.51]I would love for you to check it out.
[247:51.87]I got a glow-in-the-dark shirt.
[247:53.01]We'll take a picture of it so you can see what the glow-in-the-dark really looks like.
[247:55.71]It's about a shitty webcam.
[247:57.95]Should be cool.
[247:58.55]It looks pretty cool.
[248:07.15]grip game it's gonna be shared pretty frequently what I was trying to say is I like to drink water faster than I can get it out through straw
[248:47.47]Especially when I'm just thirsty as hell.
[248:58.08]Use a bigger straw.
[249:01.35]Man.
[249:13.94]Come on.
[249:17.78]I need mana!
[249:21.59]I was gonna say, that was it?
[249:50.25]Do the vortex trick so the water goes into the straw faster.
[249:53.43]How does that work?
[250:21.72]Oh, I completely forgot.
[250:25.72]So the Grotto Beach presale stuff.
[250:28.61]There's been some questions on that.
[250:29.61]I'll answer it very quickly.
[250:31.65]So the whole point of the presale was to make sure that we didn't run out of inventory.
[250:38.52]We'd be able to get more for this period.
[250:41.98]But as of this coming, I believe this coming week, we're going to be coming out of presale.
[250:49.50]So what that really realistically means is that we're not... Hold on.
[250:57.99]I want to die.
[251:03.91]Okay, so with that... Ooh, hold on.
[251:17.32]Almost 10% of crowd-controlled enemies.
[251:20.59]Close enemies?
[251:24.49]Okay, so it's essentially 13% to 14% more damage no matter what.
[251:35.72]Very cool.
[251:39.60]Got a lucky hit.
[251:41.50]Close enemies.
[251:42.96]And then more lightning damage.
[251:46.47]So I gotta get close.
[251:50.75]But yeah, so we're confident now that a lot of the... We want to make sure that the people that really wanted to get in on it had access to it.
[251:59.57]So now we're just coming out of pre-sale soon.
[252:02.97]So just when they're gone, if they are gone, then that's it.
[252:07.53]There's still availability.
[252:11.15]So I wouldn't worry too much about... Oh shit, I gotta hurry the fuck up.
[252:16.47]uh but we're we don't need to be in a pre-sale anymore as of um this first shipment especially because this first shipment is going pretty soon from my understanding so
[252:50.92]Did you dye your eyes?
[252:52.12]No.
[252:55.16]You've mastered your fear.
[252:57.10]How is it selling?
[252:57.76]What's your expectations?
[253:00.12]We'll talk about this later.
[253:03.01]You miss your daughter.
[253:05.65]My magpie.
[253:07.81]She's scared right now.
[253:09.93]She must be.
[253:11.99]Go.
[253:14.08]Or stay.
[253:16.36]It is time to choose.
[253:17.74]I can't.
[253:21.00]I trained her well.
[253:22.22]She's a good kid.
[253:23.38]Strong.
[253:24.44]She'll be alright.
[253:25.14]She... You've chosen well, my child.
[253:31.50]To reach Rathma, we will need to cross a lake at the bottom of these ruins.
[253:38.66]It requires a ritual.
[253:41.68]I will teach you.
[253:44.20]As you wish, Mother.
[253:47.84]Good.
[253:49.30]You're ready for lesson one.
[253:51.99]Okay, so...
[254:19.67]It's been selling that the sales have absolutely been above and beyond expectations.
[254:25.30]It's part of the reason to do the pre-sale.
[254:27.04]So I told you a couple weeks ago, the booster packs, we had to do another print on the boosters.
[254:33.53]because we essentially went through the whole first print of the booster packs so that was part of the reason to stay in a pre-sale for a while because we didn't want to just have it run out and then it's just okay well that's it whoever gets it gets it without making sure that people that want to get in on this first pass are able to get in
[254:55.36]So the second print of the boosters, we're in the middle of going through that now.
[255:00.34]So there's inventory now.
[255:02.56]And I think we're comfortable and confident to now just pull us out of a pre-sale and just let it just exist now.
[255:09.70]Again, we were trying to make sure to make it so you were just going to get it if you wanted it.
[255:16.79]And now it should be able to be available.
[255:19.23]I mean, I don't think there's any... If you are thinking right now that... Oh my god, it's going to run out tomorrow when they come out of pre-sale.
[255:29.50]That's not going to happen.
[255:31.14]I can... Well, I don't know, but... We do have plenty of inventory.
[255:37.52]Now, that being said...
[255:39.80]I'm not going to promise you that there will be, because who knows in the future.
[255:43.29]I'm not going to say.
[255:45.37]But when it's gone, it will be gone.
[255:48.93]At least when we come out of pre-sale.
[256:06.86]And I can briefly talk about the digital version.
[256:10.20]I talked about it very briefly.
[256:11.14]I'm just going to reiterate it one more time.
[256:12.42]The idea is to have a digital version of this.
[256:15.30]Whether it be a mod of something else or some other standalone, we don't know.
[256:20.33]We're trying to figure that out, but the whole idea is to make it because this is channel merch.
[256:24.01]It's merch for this community, but...
[256:26.25]We do understand that there is a game on top of it.
[256:31.15]And a lot of you guys, a lot of people that would be buying this, maybe you don't have access to be able to play a physical card game with somebody.
[256:37.96]So we wanted to make it so it was possible to be able to play the actual game portion of it and not have to worry about it too much.
[256:45.56]So the merch can be merch for the channel and then we can have a game, a digital version of the game that you don't really have to worry about.
[256:59.74]And again, this would not be... Let me... I'm going to make this really clear.
[257:03.05]Whatever digital version that we do, and like what I said, whether it's a mod or something else, this is not a case of, oh, now I have to buy digital card packs.
[257:15.64]No.
[257:16.84]No.
[257:18.14]That's not what would be happening.
[257:42.95]Would it be all card access in the digital version?
[257:46.74]I think the idea is that that would be yes.
[257:49.84]We're still trying to figure that out.
[257:50.98]We don't know how to implement everything perfectly, but I think that's the idea.
[258:00.29]But we're not doing booster pack openings digitally.
[258:03.09]That's just not happening.
[258:05.95]Because that's not something I really want to do.
[258:08.03]And everybody on the team agrees with that.
[258:19.73]That'd be kind of scummy.
[258:22.00]Well, I mean, yeah, that's... Like, I want people to enjoy the experience, right?
[258:27.32]Whether you... The card box, the card, the booster packs, it's merch.
[258:36.28]It's an interesting way for me to do, instead of doing a hoodie, it's, okay, well, let's do this instead.
[258:42.17]And this is like, when we open up, oh, what'd you get?
[258:43.75]What's in the card packs?
[258:44.53]What's in your booster?
[258:45.23]Whatever.
[258:46.89]It was just an interesting idea.
[258:48.69]but we're not going to pretend that there's not a game on top of this that people might actually want to play and might actually care about and how do you let everybody participate and have everybody enjoy something like that um especially when we think of how many people you know from different countries you know who knows if you can't just play like a physical card game with somebody from like a different state or a different country or a different town right
[259:17.87]And I don't want to have this turn into some never-ending monetized thing.
[259:23.15]That is... Oh, yeah, you bought the physical cards.
[259:26.11]Buy all the digital packs, too.
[259:27.81]Good luck.
[259:29.67]No, I don't think so.
[259:33.90]We all seem to agree on that.
[259:49.11]We are very excited, so when people actually get them, I wonder what the experience will be, right?
[260:03.15]The starter kit and the boosters are already $80 and $10 respectively.
[260:09.31]I'm not going to tell you to... I'm not going to make you buy a bunch of shit in a digital version.
[260:15.40]It's not going to happen.
[260:29.93]Play with people online?
[260:32.01]Yeah, that's kind of the idea.
[260:37.68]And there's plenty of opportunities to make something where that's possible.
[260:40.54]That's the reason to do it, pretty much.
[260:51.06]Are you going to run Grotto Beasts tournaments?
[260:59.78]I... That's... I don't... It's hard to say any answers to these questions because...
[261:13.45]Let's make sure that it goes well.
[261:16.77]Let's make sure that people get things.
[261:20.61]Let's get through part one first, and then we'll figure out if there's a part two, part three, part four, part five.
[262:00.43]No, don't.
[262:01.55]Yes.
[262:06.01]Who was I even talking to?
[262:07.17]Are they going to be reprints?
[262:11.16]We've already done... What do you mean by reprint?
[262:15.85]Because we went through... We went through the booster pack inventory and needed to do a second print.
[262:22.89]Is that what you mean by that?
[262:24.22]That's what you mean, right?
[262:26.04]Because we already had to do that during the pre-sale.
[262:34.56]And we think and we hope we have enough inventory now just to kind of have it for as long as it's possible and as long as it's available still.
[262:44.03]After we get out of pre-sale.
[262:46.85]This is on the veteran difficulty.
[262:48.99]It means re-release.
[262:50.49]Oh, I don't know.
[262:51.55]We don't have any... I don't think I know...
[263:02.58]Reprint, re-release.
[263:03.28]Hold on, let's talk in a minute.
[263:04.20]My little magpie.
[263:05.44]She awakened me.
[263:07.42]She showed me things...
[263:33.36]I can't even put into words.
[263:37.24]Once I've finished, you will understand.
[263:39.90]I don't care what she showed you.
[263:42.54]Please, let's just get out of here.
[263:44.36]Oh, I see.
[263:50.10]Yes, clever magpie.
[263:53.85]Mute.
[264:32.91]Uh-oh.
[264:33.55]Ma-
[265:03.11]ow oh shit I almost have potions please I don't want you to die
[265:40.17]Oh, Pit Lord.
[265:44.44]This is so out of place.
[265:49.96]I'm not ready yet.
[265:57.83]Get out of my ears!
[266:02.67]Stop!
[266:07.52]Why can't I cast?
[266:09.19]I need time to prepare that I'm not ready yet
[266:38.00]How are you still alive?
[266:57.83]And he drops.
[266:58.87]You were protecting me.
[267:02.14]I don't want to hate you.
[267:06.11]I'm trying.
[267:06.84]I really am.
[267:13.44]We're going to make Lilith pay for what she's done.
[267:18.73]So we need blessed blood.
[267:21.69]Go back to your prava.
[267:23.69]Get that blessing.
[267:25.43]Beg if you need to.
[267:27.57]Whatever it takes.
[267:30.02]My mother started this damn ritual.
[267:33.58]I'm going to finish it.
[267:36.20]Meet me in the Mistral Woods.
[267:39.10]Why there?
[267:40.88]And it really feels like the ritual didn't even work.
[267:42.74]I mean, there was nothing that, like, happened that was...
[268:10.76]Oh, no.
[268:14.10]Where's the loot?
[268:28.32]Wait, there's no box or chest or anything?
[268:46.58]There's no box.
[268:52.11]Well.
[268:53.63]Check your inventory.
[268:57.65]Oh, I did get this.
[269:01.38]Let's do all stats.
[269:05.78]I'll hold on to it.
[269:06.38]That seems pretty good.
[269:15.00]I need to look in town at all this stuff.
[269:46.67]Alright, so if somebody... Here we go.
[269:48.35]So, Grotto Beasts re-release as in, will you be able to buy the game in the future after pre-sale and stuff runs out?
[269:54.10]Will it be a continuous item that you'll be able to purchase from the store?
[269:57.36]So, the way that it works with the printing is we have to be able to order a certain quantity for it to make sense, from my understanding.
[270:06.36]And I don't... There's no plan on us doing, like, a year or two from now.
[270:11.58]Like, oh yeah, by the way, turn it back on.
[270:15.07]I think the idea is that we have a lot of inventory now.
[270:18.65]And when it's done, it's done.
[270:20.67]And it's a limited run.
[270:22.21]And then the digital version will be a thing that exists pretty much indefinitely.
[270:29.55]But I don't know.
[270:30.03]I guess it depends on demand, too.
[270:32.07]It really depends.
[270:33.57]we we went into this as this uh being a limited run project that was supposed to be merch for the channel um and then the actual game portion of it can probably live pretty indefinitely through the digital version so yeah that's the idea but we don't know we don't know how it's gonna work out we're
[270:53.81]We're operating on it being a limited run piece of merch.
[270:58.12]That isn't going to exist until it doesn't and we have plenty of inventory.
[271:02.34]We'll see how it goes.
[271:09.18]I need to upgrade.
[271:25.33]I need a third spell.
[271:26.89]And I think it's going to be... Alright, I need to slow people down.
[271:30.35]What about... Should I just be Flameshield?
[271:38.63]That seems kind of good.
[271:40.96]I'm doing it.
[271:41.32]So you're immune when it's active.
[271:49.98]So if there's a bunch of enemies, I can just press it.
[271:51.90]It'll just go boom, boom, boom.
[271:58.33]These are the players, I think.
[271:59.46]Oh, it is.
[272:02.58]These are other players.
[272:03.24]I need to go to the blacksmith.
[272:20.59]What else is in here? 3500.
[272:30.31]I wonder if it's always salvage.
[272:34.73]Let's have a look at you, hmm?
[272:37.45]Hmm.
[272:39.07]Buckles need reinforcing.
[272:41.62]This leather's cracked.
[272:44.04]What have you been getting yourself into, huh?
[272:47.74]Look, you live or die by the quality of your equipment.
[272:52.00]If you have the coin and materials, I can improve it for you.
[272:59.73]Alright, don't do this yet.
[273:04.18]Let me see.
[273:04.62]Alright, get rid of that.
[273:09.66]Get rid of that.
[273:10.84]I just don't want to accidentally give her something I can use.
[273:27.79]You can take what's left.
[273:29.12]Like that, okay.
[273:29.84]Let me get out of this menu.
[273:40.34]This gives more fi- eh, 1.5% of 60 damage is like .2 or something, who cares.
[273:58.45]OK, salvage.
[274:01.33]Came apart nicely.
[274:06.75]Can't salvage that one, huh?
[274:11.80]Upgrade.
[274:19.14]What?
[274:19.56]OK, hold on a second.
[274:29.81]This is probably a bad idea.
[274:33.59]What about Nancy Drew?
[274:34.31]Oh my god, Nancy Drew is just sitting in the cold.
[274:37.15]I don't think I'm going to do this.
[274:42.04]You replace so much stuff in the early levels at what point?
[274:46.16]Is there a stash?
[274:52.83]Where is it?
[275:09.92]There it is.
[275:13.46]I wonder how the stash works.
[275:14.46]Is it account bound?
[275:15.64]Is it account stuff?
[275:16.44]Or is... Is it between characters?
[275:20.22]Is it just individual?
[275:21.32]Is there a shared tab?
[275:23.56]How does it work?
[275:25.42]What about sorcery?
[275:27.12]Yeah, I know.
[275:28.74]I gotta finish Breath of the Wild before sorcery, though.
[275:30.82]I feel like that's more necessary because the new one's coming out soon.
[275:48.00]So you can buy more tabs, I'm assuming.
[275:51.10]Okay, cool.
[275:57.22]What do I give these to?
[276:00.86]Ravenous dead.
[276:10.20]Oh, it's part of the quest.
[276:11.07]I have to upgrade one thing.
[276:15.64]Alright, I'll do it.
[276:17.18]Healing potion upgrade.
[276:23.18]Interesting.
[276:23.73]I'll do this first.
[276:25.11]Wait, hold on.
[276:36.79]You're not going to play Tears of the Kingdom for years.
[276:38.83]Maybe not.
[276:51.26]Excellent work, friend.
[276:53.48]Ghoul hearts seem to have captivated the clergy as of late.
[276:57.76]It's no surprise, really.
[276:59.78]Understanding your enemy is the first step to defeating them.
[277:03.53]What would you do if your soul was trapped in a cube?
[277:06.01]I would wait patiently until some random dumb adventurer let me out.
[277:10.65]Might take a few thousand years, might take a few million, but it would probably happen eventually.
[277:29.79]My husband, Theodore, left our home in the middle of the night.
[277:34.09]I heard him talking to someone, another woman.
[277:38.83]I went to confront them, but they fled towards a strange light in the forest.
[277:44.27]They have been gone all night.
[277:46.68]I think it's time I went after him, but the forest is dangerous.
[277:51.16]Would you accompany me?
[277:53.45]Hmm, escort quest?
[277:58.16]Sure, let's go.
[277:58.70]I can try my new move.
[278:06.53]That's fine.
[278:08.99]How does the new move work?
[278:12.13]Okay.
[278:14.75]What's the radius?
[278:27.31]Jesus.
[278:29.69]Okay, it's down here.
[278:32.05]I'll help the lady.
[278:32.99]Why not?
[278:45.29]I wonder, is magic find in the game?
[278:47.33]Because that was always fun in Diablo II.
[279:13.33]Alright, that was pretty good.
[279:15.39]That's pretty good.
[279:15.81]So you group them all up and then just do the big fireball.
[279:29.62]Would you go back to Cuphead for money?
[279:32.86]No.
[279:34.52]No.
[279:34.64]No.
[279:42.42]Just out of curiosity though, how much money?
[279:45.64]Just curious.
[279:47.46]What do you mean by that?
[279:56.28]No.
[280:11.78]No, I got everything I wanted out of Cuphead.
[280:15.62]It was a very, very fun experience.
[280:17.50]The game was great.
[280:19.24]But I'm done with it.
[280:23.22]Games like that I probably go back to every so often.
[280:26.54]Usually like a year or two will... Cuphead's one of those gamer cooldowns.
[280:31.83]You know what I mean?
[280:35.19]You got like a gamer cooldown where you play it and a year goes by and it's like, alright, I'm ready to do it again.
[280:45.42]That happens to me with Dark Souls.
[280:46.51]It happens to me with pretty much any game that requires very intense focus.
[281:00.56]You get the gamer cooldown.
[281:09.31]Watch out!
[281:14.05]Oh, come off it.
[281:15.17]What do you mean?
[281:15.89]What's that?
[281:16.57]That was very... Oh, come off it.
[281:20.88]Come off it.
[281:21.46]Is he drunk?
[281:24.88]No, what?
[281:27.16]Why was that such a weird... That was a weird take to some people.
[281:29.80]What was it?
[281:30.92]It's kind of like a movie.
[281:40.22]Some really, really...
[281:48.17]There's a lot of movies that I, you know, the movie cooldown, same thing.
[281:53.15]Do I have to stand still for that?
[282:18.79]Wait, Will Neff wants to play?
[282:26.28]Will wants to play?
[282:28.38]Oh, hold on.
[282:28.90]I think, wait.
[282:29.54]Is that what I... I got a notification over here.
[282:31.24]Hold on a second.
[282:35.74]Oh, no.
[282:36.31]The Drew crew is about to be very disappointed.
[282:40.73]Ooh.
[282:41.31]Ooh.
[282:47.33]But that's not, hold on, that's not accurate.
[282:50.99]It's very possible that I get booted and have a 20 minute queue.
[282:56.69]How about this, Drew Crew, let's do some bargaining here.
[283:00.87]Drew Crew, I've come to bargain.
[283:04.46]I want to play Nancy Drew and the Ice Wolf on Thursday of next week.
[283:17.76]You understand me?
[283:23.18]Oh, no, that's Resident Evil 4.
[283:27.80]Fuck, I think you guys might be in a little bit of trouble here.
[283:30.18]How about this?
[283:38.15]Drew Crew?
[283:39.99]I'll tell you.
[283:42.29]If I don't play Nancy Drew and the Ice Wolf, or whatever that game was that we were playing earlier,
[283:48.84]By the end of March 31st, I will delete my Twitch channel.
[283:55.44]Okay?
[283:55.80]There you go.
[283:57.34]If I do not play Drew Crew and the Icicle Wolf, whatever that game that we played earlier, I will, um... That's a bad thing to say.
[284:05.90]MonkaS.
[284:07.49]I'll just play it before the... Okay.
[284:09.29]Wipe that bet.
[284:10.81]Wipe that deal.
[284:12.49]I will just play it before the 31st of March of this year.
[284:16.87]There you go.
[284:28.01]Drew Crew accepts.
[284:29.71]Okay.
[284:37.52]Uh, what was I supposed to do?
[284:39.48]Oh, find her husband.
[284:46.74]It might be worth checking out the multiplayer to see how it works.
[284:51.64]Although I'm going to have to add a few people though.
[284:57.13]Did I level up again?
[284:57.89]Ooh, I like that.
[285:10.52]More damage, more duration.
[285:12.18]What do you guys think?
[285:14.02]I think it's a pretty good escape.
[285:22.82]Will's in a party right now.
[285:25.12]Uh, well, whatever.
[285:25.74]I figure it...
[285:27.71]We'll figure it out.
[285:31.95]I think I want more damage.
[285:34.17]Because this move actually is.
[285:34.91]And you don't have to stand still.
[285:35.84]That's good.
[285:36.50]Okay.
[285:36.76]Just checking to make sure.
[285:37.42]Alright.
[285:39.56]Where is your husband?
[285:42.62]Are you really going to go all fire?
[285:43.69]I'm going to go mostly fire.
[285:58.74]Fire Sorceress is one thing I never really did in Diablo II, so I'm going to fix that and do it in Diablo 4.
[286:04.70]How are you going to explain to that group that you only have three skills?
[286:10.32]I'm not going to say that.
[286:14.77]But who cares if I only have three skills?
[286:16.03]They're very powerful.
[286:18.11]It doesn't matter.
[286:18.69]Hey, here's the nature of Diablo.
[286:24.98]I make my build.
[286:25.92]You make your build.
[286:26.64]If you want a whole hot bar of moves and you don't just want three fire abilities, then you do it.
[286:32.36]Good luck.
[286:36.39]Good luck.
[286:38.53]Oh, my God.
[286:39.21]Don't let her run.
[286:42.67]Don't let her run.
[286:55.39]Such sights... ...I have witnessed... ...such pleasure... ...such pain... ...I must have... ...more.
[287:07.85]What?
[287:09.23]Fyodor?
[287:10.61]H-how is it that you... More!
[287:15.03]Please... ...go after that woman who did this to him!
[287:19.71]More!
[287:21.05]More, more, more!
[287:28.39]I'm going to leave you two to sort this out.
[287:29.49]And I'm going to go this way.
[287:38.23]It's no surprise Fedor was drawn to me.
[287:42.67]But I have given only what was desired.
[287:50.13]His petty soul has been torn asunder by agony and ecstasy, but his flesh is unyielding.
[287:59.81]You will not interfere.
[288:02.89]Oops, I'm not ready yet.
[288:31.66]I'm going to go back over there.
[288:33.32]I don't really want to know what's over there.
[288:47.67]More.
[288:49.65]More.
[288:52.77]You.
[288:53.95]You deserve much worse than the mercy I have just shown you.
[289:05.24]That woman was a demon.
[289:07.16]I have dealt with her.
[289:08.10]Oh, shit.
[290:11.44]10% more damage to injured enemies.
[290:12.82]11% basic skill damage.
[290:19.30]I don't think it's better than this.
[290:23.84]This staff is actually really good.
[290:26.27]I get a plus damage increase to anything.
[290:29.05]Doesn't matter how close or how far away.
[290:32.55]I think I'll hold on to that.
[290:41.02]Yeah, I think that sounds good.
[290:48.99]That was an interesting quest.
[290:51.69]Any advice on how to stop slouching?
[290:54.53]Um, not really, but I'll tell you a little tip.
[290:59.80]Every, I would say in between, okay, let's say you're playing, let's say you're playing Apex Legends, right?
[291:05.86]Drop.
[291:06.90]Got 100 people that you have to fight.
[291:08.82]You get that guy, you get that one, you get that person.
[291:10.90]Boom, you're in the top 10.
[291:12.81]You got nine people running around.
[291:15.61]Ah, you got sniped from the window.
[291:18.65]Nice fucking work, though.
[291:19.79]Nice job.
[291:20.43]You did it.
[291:21.95]After every round, just sit up.
[291:24.85]Sit up after every run.
[291:27.61]Just make it clear that every time that you are going to get... And that was a... Who cares?
[291:31.79]Okay.
[291:33.72]Alright, I'm going this way.
[291:44.70]Just make a conscious effort every so often.
[291:48.59]Every 20, 30 minutes or so.
[291:50.09]Or like 40 minutes.
[291:52.13]Correct it.
[291:52.57]That's what I do.
[291:53.23]You see it happen all the time.
[291:55.35]How many times have you seen me just kind of move and go, wait a minute, hold on.
[291:59.02]And readjust and stay that way.
[292:09.24]Who cares?
[292:09.82]No, I didn't mean that.
[292:10.79]I just mean like, who cares about that story I was telling you?
[292:24.17]A lot of people didn't believe in that.
[292:27.07]Yeah, I'm a dental assistant.
[292:31.78]So yeah, just after you do the teeth work, then just kind of sit up for a little bit.
[292:37.96]Stretch a little bit.
[292:40.38]You got a nice target-ass shirt.
[292:43.31]Don't know where I got this shirt.
[292:45.61]All you can do is speculate.
[293:01.43]Ooh!
[293:03.55]Ring.
[293:05.87]Can I do anything with this?
[293:06.51]So this close range, this far away range, is there a medium range?
[293:30.56]Got that shirt.
[293:31.24]Kids are us.
[293:32.40]Rofflecopter.
[293:39.53]Behold the truths that lie within.
[293:41.21]I didn't do anything with this stuff.
[293:44.78]There's something strange going on here.
[293:47.94]Nehram must be nearby.
[293:58.91]Alright, search.
[294:07.17]Am I at the right level for this place?
[294:10.63]Oh, somebody wanted to see this.
[294:16.48]I'll show it to you.
[294:18.16]You're still here.
[294:25.20]Is there a place to see the...
[294:30.61]um the difficulties or is that a different menu we've had the McDonald's shamrock shake uh yeah I've had a sip or two of it one of those items where you can only have one sip or two sips before you just like just never want to drink it ever again but those three or four sips are delicious
[295:08.39]The first sip of a shamrock shake is... This is the greatest thing I've ever had in my life.
[295:14.26]Nothing will ever compare to how good this tastes.
[295:16.86]Sip two is kind of mostly just sugar flavor.
[295:21.96]Sip three is this is the best thing I've ever had in my whole life, again.
[295:25.96]And then sip five hurts and makes me kind of want to put it down.
[295:42.93]missed four exactly except four is between you and god that's right
[296:09.23]We don't talk about SIP4.
[296:11.59]We don't discuss SIP4.
[296:39.54]I do appreciate that the thought shows you if it's going to kill them.
[296:55.71]If you're not out of shake by step four, you're doing it wrong.
[297:02.94]That depends.
[297:20.85]Sips or gulps?
[297:22.07]Well, that's what I was saying to you guys earlier.
[297:24.83]Drinking water?
[297:29.03]Sometimes I can drink a water faster than anything.
[297:34.14]Where am I going here?
[297:34.90]This way.
[297:45.79]Alright, this way.
[297:49.56]What temperature do you like your water at?
[297:53.82]Water, to me, needs to be just above room temperature.
[298:00.09]Not cold, but above room temp.
[298:03.05]So maybe something like
[298:10.72]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[298:11.36]Below, below, below.
[298:12.10]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[298:12.82]Below.
[298:13.36]Just below.
[298:13.86]I'm not, like, high.
[298:17.54]Just below room temp.
[298:20.82]So, let's say room temp is somewhere between, what, like, 68?
[298:23.80]70?
[298:23.92]I like a, like, a 60 degree.
[298:31.49]Like, 50 to 60 degree.
[298:34.75]The portal will lead you through this crude trap.
[298:41.16]Nancy?
[298:41.46]It's the ice wolf.
[298:52.27]Okay.
[298:54.89]Chest.
[298:55.15]Who is this?
[299:16.20]Who are you?
[299:18.40]An admirer of sorts.
[299:22.22]I saved you in the mountains.
[299:24.86]You'd lost your horse and crawled into that cave.
[299:29.41]Would have frozen to death if not for me.
[299:34.55]Why are you helping me?
[299:37.19]Oh, it's very simple.
[299:38.97]You want to stop Lilith, and I want you to succeed.
[299:43.60]But you'll never do that by following the Holrodrim.
[299:54.69]Their path always ends in fire and death.
[300:01.06]So what is this path?
[300:02.92]Exactly.
[300:04.40]Seems pretty fiery and seems pretty deadly enough.
[300:08.28]Open the door.
[300:13.69]You don't bring people here.
[300:15.93]And say that you know you gotta.
[300:18.41]You gotta clean this place up a little bit before you say it's not fire and death over here.
[300:32.64]It's a cool looking place though.
[300:38.16]Why are you telling me all this?
[300:41.16]To warn you.
[300:43.23]A day will come when the Haradrim stumble.
[300:47.65]Don't be there when they do.
[300:49.85]Is it going to be Diablo?
[300:52.69]The portal will lead you to that little girl you're looking for.
[301:06.59]I like the world the way it was without Lilith.
[301:12.24]Her little game of rebellion will only lead to chaos.
[301:17.62]You've already seen visions of the damage she can do.
[301:23.57]Yes, I know you were fed.
[301:27.90]feel it changing you perhaps not yet but as long as Lilith walks in your world it is only a matter of time Tristram of old imprisoned Diablo the lord of terror beneath the Earth
[301:55.36]And then they built this town nearby.
[302:02.32]You can see how that turned out.
[302:05.86]This worked.
[302:14.95]OK, let's go.
[302:27.05]Back in the Haradrim's illusion.
[302:30.89]Alright, let's go.
[302:41.96]I think I've lost my way.
[302:43.58]The same thing happened to my mother and me earlier on.
[302:47.44]The trail to the vault ends here, so it should be somewhere around in these woods.
[302:57.20]Find the way to the Roderick vault.
[303:08.86]Someone toying with us.
[303:10.08]This place is amazing.
[303:11.84]Oh, I should have held on to that.
[303:13.72]I need time to prepare.
[303:25.48]Where'd they go?
[303:27.88]Alright, bunch everybody up.
[303:32.81]Bunch everybody up.
[303:33.48]Bunch, bunch, bunch, bunch.
[303:58.63]Got it.
[304:00.89]You actually despawned them?
[304:02.19]I don't know.
[304:05.93]What the heck?
[304:09.73]How does it feel so far?
[304:15.21]It feels good to play.
[304:16.11]I do like
[304:21.50]OK, I'm going to give you a take.
[304:24.00]One of the things I really like about these kinds of games, especially like D2 and others.
[304:31.25]I played Grim Dawn, I did.
[304:34.57]And let me get my nose on camera.
[304:38.40]I really didn't like in D3, and I know this is, people are going to say, what's the difference?
[304:43.03]It doesn't matter.
[304:43.65]You can just respec or whatever.
[304:45.85]But having access to every single ability, every single one, and you can just kind of, if you make a barbarian, you are every barbarian if you want to be.
[304:57.71]And it's only, Diablo 3 really relied on you finding a set that had some crazy modifier to something.
[305:07.69]Uh, but I like so far that you have to pick stuff.
[305:13.91]And it's, I guess, permanent unless you refund it, which it looks like.
[305:17.33]I wonder if I do this, it's four gold, it probably will go higher, I'm imagining.
[305:23.51]So, I don't know if that's the accurate, who knows, but I like the fact that if you make a sorceress or a wizard or a barbarian, it's not, not every barbarian's the same barbarian, because I can just do the moves you're doing.
[305:34.12]If I really feel like it, I can just swap them out.
[305:37.39]I like building characters.
[305:38.87]I like making a wizard, for instance, that I have to make two.
[305:43.79]I have to make three.
[305:44.63]I have to make five.
[305:46.27]I have to make ten to experience some of all the builds that I would like to experience.
[305:51.02]I like it more that way.
[305:54.54]Now you could say, well, you're just kind of adding more unnecessary time.
[305:59.22]But I like that.
[305:59.88]I kind of like having permanent decisions.
[306:02.95]That maybe they're not completely permanent, but they're permanent.
[306:05.31]And I'm talking to my channel.
[306:09.37]I want it to be permanent.
[306:13.41]This dude's waffling?
[306:15.71]I don't think so.
[306:17.39]What is right here?
[306:18.05]Because I can do it.
[306:27.71]He's talking to his kids.
[306:35.49]Is that rare?
[306:36.01]That was like gold letters.
[306:45.24]I kind of like being able to make mistakes.
[306:50.07]Or make characters that are kind of maybe unconventional, that are just strange.
[306:54.91]That maybe they're not the most powerful, but you can still do it.
[306:57.53]And maybe you find items that make it fun to do.
[307:03.44]The runes in D3 were interesting, but it really did feel like... And this is probably likely to happen here too, but... There were a few runes that were just so good.
[307:15.15]They were just unbelievably good.
[307:18.45]And why would you pick anything else?
[307:22.89]Uh, what do I have to do?
[307:23.69]Pray?
[307:24.99]Give thanks.
[307:25.69]Um.
[307:30.23]Help.
[307:43.72]Nice.
[307:44.02]What is this?
[307:49.91]Elixir of what?
[307:57.20]Increases lucky hit chance by 30% and an experience gained for 30 minutes.
[308:03.66]Oh, I can't even use these.
[308:07.93]That's pretty cool.
[308:12.77]I like unique gear.
[308:14.03]I like collecting stuff.
[308:15.33]And I like making characters that other people might not have.
[308:22.15]Yes.
[308:23.13]Diablo II shout barbarians come to mind.
[308:26.26]Potion find barbarians come to mind.
[308:27.96]If you got into a game where there was a potion find barbarian, it was just like, ah, you're, okay, you're a weirdo.
[308:36.67]And that's, okay, that's, alright.
[308:40.27]It was, it was kind of interesting.
[308:41.61]It's a grandpa take.
[308:42.43]That's fine.
[308:47.94]Now, obviously, Diablo II was, there were things that you should do.
[308:52.62]There were things that were just crazy.
[308:56.42]And you'd see a lot of sorceresses running around with Frozen Orb or like Nova was unbelievably good for a while.
[309:05.78]But you still could do the other stuff and it was still fun.
[309:12.84]You're muted.
[309:17.26]What?
[309:17.88]I just said a bunch of stuff.
[309:22.16]Ooh.
[309:22.36]We're going in here.
[309:27.24]Summoner was OP.
[309:28.14]I feel like we're getting booted now.
[309:34.73]Summoning Necromancer was so... It was just so goofy.
[309:39.27]I don't know how you do that now.
[309:41.88]Because I think... The technology might not be able to handle...
[309:47.63]hundreds, if not, you know, two or three hundred.
[309:50.81]If you got three or four necromancers in a game, maybe it would just break the server.
[309:54.55]I don't know.
[309:58.30]How is he not noticed?
[310:05.68]What are you talking about?
[310:08.82]Everyone say one.
[310:16.57]I win.
[310:20.23]Is that the only thing in here?
[310:26.65]Missed experience.
[310:30.20]Featured Peaks.
[310:31.22]Total Renown.
[310:34.36]Whoa, what's this?
[310:35.18]I just got 3,000 gold and a skill point.
[310:46.77]Holy shit.
[310:51.05]Alright.
[310:53.13]One skill point has been added for all characters on this realm.
[311:02.63]I did that.
[311:03.07]I want the movement speed.
[311:17.23]This is good too.
[311:19.11]It's all your characters too.
[311:20.87]How are they going to handle that?
[311:24.50]Does that just cap out at some point?
[311:27.78]I have to imagine that that would get kind of weird after a while.
[311:37.38]Only a certain number per region.
[311:46.55]Just the characters you own.
[311:49.65]You did that.
[311:51.77]I did that.
[311:54.81]So you don't have to replay everything.
[311:58.49]Countdown.
[311:58.85]Oh, okay.
[312:05.80]Is there a town hub?
[312:06.56]Looks like there's quite a few of them.
[312:09.44]Show the map.
[312:10.56]We might be getting booted here.
[312:23.77]I think so.
[312:24.15]I think we're getting booted.
[312:41.04]I'll give it 30 more seconds, so then I'm going to restart it.
[312:43.29]10 seconds.
[313:05.60]10 seconds.
[313:16.83]Okay.
[313:17.51]Messed up.
[313:20.85]I hope I don't lose progress or something.
[313:29.13]I was wondering why my room was hotter.
[313:32.54]It's because I have two games open running at the same time.
[313:40.79]I was wondering, why is it so hot in here?
[313:42.76]Okay, let's try to get in the queue again.
[313:51.52]Oh, there we go.
[314:02.07]Nancy Drew is definitely not running the GPU hot.
[314:05.01]Yeah, but it's still operating.
[314:11.05]We've got a long one here.
[314:14.11]In fact, we might not even do this anymore.
[314:17.37]It's 20 minutes in the queue.
[314:22.38]We might just be doing Drew Crew for a little while.
[314:28.58]Let's see.
[314:35.60]Can you see Nancy Drew?
[314:40.57]The problem with playing two games at the same time is I need to remember what the hell we just did.
[314:45.03]An hour and 25 minutes ago.
[314:47.90]Right?
[314:48.68]That's the hard part.
[314:55.70]Hmm.
[314:55.98]Hmm.
[315:17.83]Hold on.
[315:23.03]Hold on.
[315:29.50]I'm just going to tell Will that I just got a pretty big queue.
[315:32.08]Mm-hmm.
[315:50.81]How do you spell Q?
[315:53.71]It's such a weird word to spell.
[316:05.69]I'm going to do an emote.
[316:07.21]What's a good emote to do?
[316:12.88]A sideways crying laughing face?
[316:14.84]Something zany.
[316:18.56]I was going to put Bugleberry in here.
[316:35.97]Alright, Nancy.
[316:38.11]What have we done?
[316:47.88]Where were those... They were playing that game and they were saying, hey, fix the lake, please.
[316:53.88]Where was that?
[316:58.77]Wasn't it here?
[317:02.47]It was here.
[317:08.21]Maybe they went out to the lake.
[317:09.23]Should I go upstairs?
[317:18.57]Go into their rooms?
[317:22.07]This chute is for dirty laundry.
[317:42.03]Do I have to do the match the colors or something?
[317:53.23]What was it?
[317:53.69]Red.
[317:54.05]It's red, blue, then green.
[318:00.72]It was certain colors, right?
[318:10.70]Use the key?
[318:15.38]Definitely have to get this right.
[318:20.73]Nobody has an actual key thing on their door.
[318:31.59]Emergency exit only.
[318:33.89]Cold warning.
[318:34.49]Okay.
[318:36.63]Put the key in your bag and use it on the door.
[318:47.48]Oh.
[318:53.75]Okay, what do you got in here?
[318:58.43]Rudimentary geology.
[319:02.75]Structural engineering.
[319:06.84]Large machinery safety protocol.
[319:08.86]Okay.
[319:19.98]Make the bed.
[319:20.48]What about this?
[319:28.42]Wait a minute, hold on.
[319:30.48]Go back over there?
[319:31.02]Is somebody coming?
[319:39.54]The chute!
[319:49.29]What, do I need a basket?
[319:53.04]That's not scary music.
[319:57.76]It's the Diablo Q. Can I open this?
[320:06.45]I cannot.
[320:13.11]I cannot.
[320:17.35]Well, what about whatever's going on?
[320:19.05]I need a laundry basket or something, right?
[320:21.09]My eye's been so itchy today.
[320:34.57]Hates to lose.
[320:36.57]Expected to win, and I always did.
[320:38.95]Knowing your enemy is the surest way to defeat them.
[320:41.74]I know some of my competitions better than I know myself.
[320:52.80]Some believe he studies his competitors so he can eliminate them.
[320:59.32]Why is he wearing a rifle?
[321:02.41]Environmental champion.
[321:06.17]Biathlon Bob's tip of the month.
[321:07.71]Okay.
[321:24.20]shoot I can't clean this room I need a laundry basket I'm not doing this till I get a laundry basket is there a staff room or something I can get to that's not what goes here I need a laundry basket is it like a staff room or a
[321:59.27]From last year.
[322:06.76]Interesting.
[322:07.38]Okay, pick up laundry bag at the front desk.
[322:14.00]Available after 5.45 a.m.
[322:15.26]I took too long.
[322:45.94]Isn't this the front desk?
[323:06.12]We're sorry.
[323:06.86]Your call... I'm on the jackpot.
[323:09.23]Please check the number and dial again.
[323:10.89]This is a recording.
[323:27.94]this is the sheriff's office nobody's in the office right now so you can either hang up and call back or wait for the beep and leave us a message your choice might as well leave a message hi sheriff it's Nancy Drew nothing urgent I'm just kind of checking in so if I don't hear from you I'll call you back later bye okay alright what about uh tino balducci
[324:01.66]That was a pointless message.
[324:03.91]Hey, I didn't catch you, but... Whoops, I'll try again.
[324:08.31]I'm not sure helped is the right word, Mr. Balducci.
[324:26.39]In fact, Tino, I'm a little surprised you're still in law enforcement, considering some of the unethical, if not illegal, stunts you pulled back then.
[324:34.89]Hey, that's all behind me.
[324:37.83]Ancient history.
[324:38.95]Water under the bridge.
[324:40.80]So, looks like we're gonna be working together on this sabotage thing, huh?
[324:45.50]Looks like.
[324:46.70]Well, you'll be happy to know that I'm working on something that'll pretty much crack this case wide open.
[324:53.70]But in the meantime, what can I do you for?
[324:56.28]I'm curious.
[324:59.10]How do you know Chantal?
[325:01.14]A friend heard about all the problems she was having up there and immediately figured she could use my crime-solving expertise.
[325:08.20]So I gave her a call, we had lunch, we hit it off, and bingo.
[325:12.76]I got myself a new client.
[325:14.92]How many clients do you have?
[325:20.05]One large pepperoni.
[325:21.07]Okay.
[325:21.27]That's a lot of pause.
[325:48.45]No, get... I want to leave the phone.
[325:51.91]How do I put the phone down?
[325:52.99]Okay.
[326:04.18]This.
[326:13.76]Please call me.
[326:14.60]555... Okay, 283.
[326:31.31]283?
[326:31.35]What's the area?
[326:35.61]What's the code?
[326:42.15]Can you do Mario?
[326:53.22]I'm sorry.
[326:54.06]I'm sorry.
[326:55.00]Please check the number and dial again.
[326:58.04]This is a recording.
[327:12.00]I did it.
[327:19.88]I did it.
[327:23.22]I'm really high.
[327:23.84]I don't understand why I keep dialing numbers.
[327:26.07]Oh, no.
[327:26.63]Oh, no.
[327:32.87]Let's relax for a little bit.
[327:36.11]Just chill.
[327:37.65]There's no reason to...
[327:39.23]Looks like Elsa was having major boyfriend problems.
[327:44.09]Dude, I can't watch it.
[327:49.75]I'm sorry.
[327:54.66]Is this a laundry basket?
[327:55.54]How is this not a laundry... Oh.
[327:57.52]Give me this.
[328:05.80]Dear Elsa, this time when I read in your letter saying you weren't coming, I didn't get sad, I got mad.
[328:15.37]I can't believe you think working as a stupid maid at some stupid lodge for some stupid lady whose name I can't even pronounce is more important than spending time with me.
[328:23.80]If I didn't love you so much, I'd tell you to go take a flying leap.
[328:27.98]But since I love you more than anything, I'll just have to do something else, like maybe take your precious collection of troll dolls out of the box you stored in my garage and dump them down the disposal.
[328:36.20]Or maybe I'll sell them on eBay for a nickel a piece.
[328:39.84]I don't know how else to make you understand that I love you with all my heart, and I always will.
[328:46.41]That was a review for Valorant.
[328:55.88]Okay, I need to go upstairs.
[328:56.94]Alright.
[329:06.13]Jesus, what happened?
[329:06.91]Oh.
[329:13.77]They have to have the thing on the door.
[329:15.01]There we go.
[329:15.49]Alright.
[329:16.87]Let's go in here.
[329:17.75]I got the laundry bag now.
[329:22.71]Clean up the room.
[329:23.79]Put the laundry in the laundry bag.
[329:36.47]Okay.
[329:38.46]Laundry.
[329:40.24]Very nice.
[329:42.62]You want laundry done as well.
[329:44.06]Okay.
[329:51.44]Okay.
[329:59.11]Anybody else have any laundry?
[329:59.97]Or is it just these two?
[330:01.43]I think that's it.
[330:09.53]It was only people that had the thing on their door.
[330:13.92]That's it, right?
[330:19.88]There's two more rooms for you to do.
[330:26.02]How do I go get that thing back?
[330:34.80]I got this.
[330:35.36]No, no, no.
[330:36.06]This is correct, right?
[330:37.08]I gotta go.
[330:46.51]I gotta go get it.
[330:47.47]Whatever.
[330:47.79]I don't even care.
[330:48.59]What's the next task to do?
[330:49.37]What's the task?
[331:13.69]Need something?
[331:17.43]You look busy.
[331:18.41]What are you making?
[331:19.69]I'm building something that's gonna solve all our problems.
[331:22.87]A wolf trap.
[331:23.95]One that'll finish off that thing out there once and for all.
[331:27.01]You think the wolf is causing the accidents?
[331:29.79]Not a doubt in my mind.
[331:31.75]Everything was A-OK till it showed up and started howling.
[331:35.27]It's bad luck.
[331:36.57]And something's protecting it.
[331:38.62]Something unnatural.
[331:40.78]Does Ms.
[331:41.26]Mwekwe know you're doing this?
[331:43.12]She knows she doesn't want that thing around her guests.
[331:45.52]And you heard her.
[331:46.52]I'm supposed to do whatever I think is necessary to get rid of it.
[331:51.56]But it's not like it's attacking people.
[331:53.57]What's wrong with this wolf?
[331:55.41]Yesterday I went looking for it.
[331:57.69]I tracked it and finally found it sitting across the creek, not 20 yards away from me, just staring at me.
[332:04.22]So I raised my rifle, drew a bead, and fired.
[332:08.33]Easiest shot I've ever taken in my life.
[332:10.53]But why though?
[332:11.13]And I missed.
[332:12.15]So I fired again.
[332:13.47]And I missed.
[332:14.23]And then I missed again.
[332:15.43]And again.
[332:16.25]And all the while I just sat there staring until finally it just stood up.
[332:20.23]Walked over the brush just as calm as could be.
[332:23.05]And disappeared.
[332:24.29]Wild animals just don't act like that.
[332:26.42]And I just don't miss like that.
[332:28.68]There's something real weird about that wolf.
[332:31.14]And I ain't gonna rest till I get rid of it.
[332:33.30]So maybe we should just find something else to jaw about.
[332:36.16]You met my little girl yet?
[332:37.76]no but you mentioned that her name is freddie yep spends most of her time outside she built herself a little snow fort just sits out there waiting for somebody to go by so she can pick a snowball fight with him I keep asking her how she manages to stay warm all day but she won't tell me says she's got a secret weapon yeah she's something why do we care about this wolf who's who cares
[333:08.68]Do we think the wolf is the one dropping the grenades?
[333:12.97]It's a magic wolf.
[333:14.81]Why do we want to kill the magic wolf?
[333:21.03]I mean, it growled at me.
[333:22.88]A wild animal would do that if you approached it.
[333:27.88]Why are we going to kill a magic wolf?
[333:30.48]Why wouldn't we want to
[333:34.15]How long have you worked for Chantal?
[333:35.69]See if it grants us wishes or something.
[333:37.33]I don't know.
[333:37.61]I was her first hire.
[333:38.87]Best hire, too.
[333:40.43]I could run this place... I'm telling you, you just throw one raw chicken at it, and it'll grant us all wishes.
[333:48.86]Just one raw turkey, and the thing will be like, oh, thank you.
[333:52.18]By the way, how much money do you want on your bank accounts tomorrow?
[333:56.51]It's a magical wolf.
[334:00.49]Have you ever been in the guest lodge business before?
[334:03.01]I tried my hand at it once.
[334:05.19]Long story short, didn't work out.
[334:07.47]But I've learned a whole lot since then.
[334:09.39]I could make it work now.
[334:10.93]Just need to find the right property, get my hands on enough cash to make a down payment, that's all.
[334:14.83]Is your wife Freddy's mom?
[334:16.75]Does she live here?
[334:17.57]Is your wife Freddy's mom?
[334:19.32]Does she live here too?
[334:20.77]In the summer she does, but in the winter she goes south.
[334:23.47]Do I not know her name?
[334:24.13]She's got this nerve condition that makes her real sensitive to cold.
[334:27.51]Freddy'd like to go with her, but until Chantal stops putting off giving me that raise she promised me, sending Freddy south too is out of the question.
[334:38.50]Can you tell me more about the accidents that have been happening around here?
[334:41.42]Nope, sure can't.
[334:45.13]You can't or you don't want to.
[334:46.99]Chantal and those lawyers of hers said I couldn't talk about them.
[334:50.18]Supposed to direct all questions to her.
[334:52.60]Sorry.
[334:57.96]Have you seen that strange concrete monument thing that's out there on the trail?
[335:01.92]Kind of weird.
[335:02.48]Of course.
[335:07.61]Is there a way to get into it, do you know?
[335:09.82]Don't know, don't really care.
[335:11.84]Maybe something in that display up in the lobby will tell you what you want to know.
[335:15.82]Did you know there was an avalanche at Chicken Ridge?
[335:18.56]Sure didn't.
[335:19.52]Not surprised, though.
[335:20.80]You call the avalanche patrol?
[335:23.70]I thought I'd tell you about it first.
[335:25.94]You better give those employee instructions I left in your room another look.
[335:29.46]Reporting avalanches is part of your job.
[335:32.37]Oops, sorry.
[335:33.97]Oh, my bad.
[335:38.86]And you should probably stop drinking fucking four fingers of whiskey before you go out to hunt the magic scary wolf.
[335:45.94]Looks like we both have things to do.
[335:50.44]I'd better get back upstairs.
[335:52.24]By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the rooms were cleaned, so I put it back up at the front desk.
[335:59.96]Oh, okay.
[336:01.20]Alright, alright, alright.
[336:02.62]So I have to call the avalanche people?
[336:07.45]This is so invigorating.
[336:13.31]This is so invigorating.
[336:14.95]I don't know why this keeps happening.
[336:31.46]Alright.
[336:32.08]That was...
[336:35.66]Nancy, I am glad to see you.
[336:38.50]Are you alright?
[336:39.39]You seem upset.
[336:40.89]You must listen.
[336:42.07]I was outside skiing very fast, as usual, and suddenly, boom!
[336:46.35]Snow, dirt, rocks, everything went flying into the air right in front of me.
[336:50.91]There is a mad bomber on the loose.
[336:53.15]Did you see anyone?
[336:54.43]I saw no one.
[336:55.39]Not before, not after.
[336:57.54]My competitors bombed the bunkhouse thinking I would be so frightened that I would abandon my training and leave.
[337:03.66]Only I wasn't frightened.
[337:05.20]So now they are trying to bomb me.
[337:10.13]Do you think they're responsible for all the accidents that have been happening around here as well?
[337:14.85]My competitors and the governments behind them, they are as desperate as they are ruthless.
[337:19.65]They are capable of anything.
[337:21.49]They can operate anywhere in the world, under all conditions.
[337:25.37]It would not surprise me if someone right here in the lodge is right now under their employ.
[337:30.26]But to them, I say, Pah!
[337:31.96]They do not scare me.
[337:33.02]I am the best cross-country skier in the world.
[337:36.14]I will neutralize their petty threats with my excellent strength, skill,
[337:40.72]and why is this person very why are you so mad what are my problems did you once have you seen the wolf while you were out training no for which I'm very grateful in my country in fredonia it is said that the gaze of the wolf will make you go blind really they are creatures of infinite evil and that is all I'm going to say on the matter
[338:11.52]You're busy, so I'll let you go.
[338:13.34]I'm telling you, it's just... I hate this sound effect.
[338:21.96]Alright, so we have to go do the laundry thing.
[338:23.78]I got a call about the avalanche.
[338:27.26]I don't think... I think Diablo is completely done, by the way.
[338:33.21]I've been sitting here and it says queued and it's just not doing anything.
[338:35.83]So I'm just going to close it.
[338:37.65]So we're not going to play any more Diablo.
[338:40.27]Unfortunate.
[338:41.85]It was fun.
[338:42.57]It was fun.
[338:42.89]I just obviously wish it worked more often.
[338:46.48]But I enjoyed it.
[338:49.66]I think it's going to be... I don't know.
[338:52.60]I can't tell you.
[338:53.68]All I know is that it was fun.
[338:55.40]For the three or four hours I got to actually play it.
[339:04.25]I cannot give you a judgment on it because it's hard to do that so early into a game that has potentially hundreds of hours of things that you need to do in it.
[339:12.90]But I will tell you that it felt better than the way that I felt about D3.
[339:18.64]And way better than I feel about Diablo Immortal.
[339:20.68]So, it was good.
[339:22.40]I thought it was fine.
[339:25.29]We'll see.
[339:38.80]Okay, I need to go back to the front desk.
[339:41.12]I gotta make a few phone calls.
[339:45.51]Alright, what was it?
[339:46.43]It was... Who do I call?
[339:51.35]I called the sheriff and it was just like, oh, I don't care, leave me alone.
[339:55.37]What, what, I have to call the... Who do I call?
[340:02.37]Ghostbusters.
[340:02.89]I actually watched Afterlife, uh, very recently.
[340:18.14]Who do I report this to?
[340:20.12]Is there another number lying around somewhere?
[340:27.16]I'm a senior detective.
[340:28.52]I don't need a task list.
[340:29.86]Come on.
[340:33.79]Phone numbers.
[340:35.79]There it is.
[340:36.41]Okay, 403.
[340:37.17]There's been an avalanche.
[340:53.39]I'm calling from the Icicle Creek Lodge, but I wanted to report an avalanche at Chicken Ridge.
[340:58.53]Anyone injured or trapped?
[340:59.94]Uh, not anymore.
[341:00.96]Well, check it out.
[341:02.16]Thanks for the heads up.
[341:03.38]Hey, wait a minute.
[341:04.32]You know Ollie Randall?
[341:05.54]The handyman here at the lodge?
[341:07.24]He's also on the patrol.
[341:08.54]Do me a favor and tell him that the explosives training in Calgary has been postponed till next month.
[341:13.34]Explosives training?
[341:14.72]Sometimes the patrol has to use explosives to bring down unstable snow.
[341:18.42]Yearly training sessions are mandatory.
[341:20.22]Ollie will know what I'm talking about.
[341:21.66]Liar.
[341:21.82]He has an old-timey radio cadence.
[341:22.95]Okay.
[341:23.05]So we did that.
[341:23.95]Now I need to close this.
[341:24.95]Get the laundry bag again.
[341:50.39]Is it lunchtime or is it dinner?
[341:51.63]I don't know.
[341:52.01]Who cares?
[341:52.31]I'm not going to serve any food.
[342:02.14]Okay.
[342:02.40]Start at the very end of the hallway.
[342:07.16]You.
[342:11.29]Make the bed.
[342:11.75]It's already made.
[342:14.91]Get the laundry.
[342:15.23]Get the laundry.
[342:20.37]Done.
[342:23.26]Leave.
[342:24.42]Across the hall.
[342:25.40]Same exact thing.
[342:26.28]Turn around.
[342:34.82]Done.
[342:35.82]This bed's made, right?
[342:36.78]It is.
[342:37.92]Leave.
[342:38.87]Turn.
[342:41.03]Down the hall.
[342:44.69]Nobody else has the we want room service thing.
[342:50.42]Is it just everybody?
[342:51.23]I thought it said only if they have the thing on their door.
[343:04.46]Does that just count?
[343:05.26]That's all.
[343:05.98]I don't have to do the whole thing again.
[343:07.04]Okay.
[343:16.05]Got it.
[343:20.42]That's done.
[343:20.96]Now what?
[343:43.37]Now what?
[343:49.96]Kind of don't know.
[343:51.93]Can't do anything here.
[343:52.59]Should I go back outside?
[344:24.38]How about go to, uh, the needle?
[344:29.40]Can you confirm that corn pop was bad?
[344:33.19]Um, corn pops?
[344:37.27]My pops, they were... How do I open this?
[344:46.29]I like, I thought the corn pops, like, gotta have my pops, right?
[344:54.53]I need to open that door.
[345:00.38]Wrong wrong.
[345:02.16]Wrong.
[345:02.48]I don't know.
[345:13.37]No more avalanches for me.
[345:15.05]Thank you very much.
[345:19.48]Where do I go?
[345:23.45]No more avalanches for me.
[345:25.13]Thank you very much.
[345:26.00]There we go.
[345:32.12]Why did nobody talk about a landfill?
[345:38.20]Book in more rooms.
[345:46.07]Oh, God damn it.
[345:51.05]It's a simple question.
[345:54.08]I don't have a simple answer for you.
[346:00.68]The speedrun for this game is 21 seconds.
[346:03.58]Is it actually?
[346:04.30]That seems ridiculous.
[346:09.88]Have I been to a landfill before?
[346:12.10]I cannot say that I've been to a landfill.
[346:15.88]No, I've been to a landfill.
[346:23.72]Look up the video of the speedrun.
[346:26.18]No, no, I want to beat this.
[346:36.49]I don't want to see the 20 second speedrun.
[346:44.27]Okay, what about, what's going on in here?
[346:51.18]It's locked.
[347:12.08]Nothing in here.
[347:21.75]Alright.
[347:29.96]What's this?
[347:32.06]Weapons!
[347:32.42]I don't know.
[347:56.37]These are locked up, completely locked up, locked up.
[348:19.36]Really?
[348:21.48]Just open it.
[348:22.42]I can't.
[348:47.22]How did I get in here?
[348:47.92]I don't understand.
[349:00.83]You got a picture of a wolf in your room.
[349:20.89]What the hell was that?
[349:26.35]Is it dinner time?
[349:26.90]Scary.
[349:51.81]Okay.
[349:53.57]Oh, this thing.
[349:54.75]What's the deal with this?
[349:57.68]What's the deal with this?
[350:03.70]I think I know the deal with this.
[350:06.18]Do I have to put the... Is it about the edges here?
[350:11.43]I don't get it.
[350:22.11]Because you see how these... I just yawned.
[350:28.09]I don't want to yawn in front of you.
[350:33.19]Like... Okay, do all the raccoons have to be with that line on the left?
[350:37.01]See what I'm saying?
[350:38.91]I think it's probably that.
[350:45.51]And then... No.
[350:45.91]I don't know what...
[350:57.68]Thanks for taking your disgusting bodily function off camera.
[351:06.36]That makes like sense to me though, right?
[351:09.32]Bottom line, right line, top line.
[351:11.32]But what about the middle?
[351:13.64]You guys want to know something interesting?
[351:16.57]What interesting?
[351:18.87]I started to do recently that I got really into.
[351:21.01]I'm curious how much I care about it.
[351:24.97]I bought a bunch of clay.
[351:27.06]I'm just making a bunch of weird shit with it.
[351:31.22]That's all.
[351:47.26]I thought at first it was just match everything, but maybe it's not.
[351:54.51]Is this a clue somehow?
[351:55.69]No.
[351:55.85]I have no idea what the solution of this is.
[352:03.78]But I feel like I should know it at some point here soon, right?
[352:23.16]Salmonella in the potato salad?
[352:29.34]I didn't do this, did I?
[352:42.49]I didn't do this.
[352:42.97]Pretty good at trying to turn the lodge into some kind of... ...hody-tody spa while she still can.
[352:50.21]First the wolf, now this.
[352:51.15]I'm leaving.
[352:54.15]Okay.
[353:02.09]Oh, they're back.
[353:03.25]What's up?
[353:07.28]Zippy Zoom.
[353:40.12]What do you think about all the weird things that have been happening around here?
[353:43.52]I think they're kind of cool.
[353:45.10]Accidents make life colorful, you know?
[353:47.32]You wouldn't be saying that if you were the one who'd slipped on those ice-covered stairs or eaten that bad potato salad or had those four flat tires.
[353:55.55]Say that again.
[353:55.99]Hey, I had that broken window.
[353:58.09]Broken window?
[353:59.07]I went snowshoeing on, like, the third day I was here, and when I got back, the window in my room was broken.
[354:04.74]Glass was all over the place.
[354:08.15]Why is he wearing Vault Dweller clothes?
[354:10.91]Who broke it?
[354:12.00]Don't know.
[354:12.90]Don't know what broke it either.
[354:15.04]There was no rock on the floor, no bullet, no nothing.
[354:18.96]It was the wolf.
[354:20.02]Tried to jump up into your room, but didn't quite make it.
[354:23.39]That's bogus, dude.
[354:24.91]My room's on the second floor.
[354:26.39]And besides, wolves don't do stuff like that.
[354:29.53]Hey, that wolf does a lot of stuff wolves aren't supposed to do.
[354:32.74]That's why it needs to be hunted down.
[354:34.80]Nobody even knows anything about this wolf.
[354:39.29]Anyway, my window broke and nobody knows why.
[354:42.75]Pretty awesome, huh?
[354:44.15]So, you like to snowshoe?
[354:45.67]I like doing stuff outside.
[354:47.60]Snowshoeing's about all I can afford.
[354:49.93]Okay.
[354:50.03]I'm very positive.
[354:50.51]Especially Lou here.
[354:51.13]What?
[354:51.29]What?
[354:51.63]What's up, kiddo?
[355:20.10]Then I just fucking backflip.
[355:48.39]Alright, maybe if I talk to... Because this guy was like, oh, you didn't do your job.
[355:51.13]But now I did.
[355:51.83]So now, does he have anything else to say?
[356:02.80]Where is he, by the way?
[356:03.70]There you are.
[356:07.30]The Avalanche Patrol asked me to tell you that the explosives training session in Calgary has been postponed until next month.
[356:13.14]Well, hallelujah.
[356:14.72]I didn't really want to go anywhere until I finished off that wolf.
[356:18.02]Now I won't have to.
[356:20.00]So, you're on the avalanche patrol, huh?
[356:22.48]Yep.
[356:22.98]Dang.
[356:23.58]I just remembered.
[356:24.61]Patrol wants me to keep an eye on Skookum Ridge for the next couple of weeks.
[356:27.99]Okay, Skookum Ridge.
[356:29.45]There's the key to the snowmobile.
[356:30.91]Take it out to Skookum Ridge and see if there's been an avalanche.
[356:34.22]You want me to check it out?
[356:36.04]Let's go.
[356:36.66]So you don't have to worry about the cold.
[356:38.74]Make sure you call the patrol and give them a report when you're done.
[356:41.98]You can handle that.
[356:43.44]It's a little chilly in here.
[356:44.52]Let me go ahead and get that fire started over there.
[356:52.64]Nice.
[356:52.90]So where are we going now?
[356:59.49]You bet.
[357:00.11]You bet.
[357:00.43]Good.
[357:07.79]I think that's enough.
[357:12.33]I'm sweaty.
[357:22.34]So now where's the snowmobile?
[357:25.73]Two more things.
[357:26.79]That Bill Kessler guy's getting bored.
[357:28.67]He's checking for Fluff, dude.
[357:31.38]He wants competition.
[357:32.50]You know me too well.
[357:33.52]That's why the cam can't be on.
[357:36.42]I did something, and... Other thing is, a cold snap's on its way.
[357:40.43]Okay, they liked it.
[357:41.89]Good.
[357:42.27]Just wait.
[357:43.19]Gotta be real careful anytime you're outside.
[357:46.37]So, we done here?
[357:47.49]Okay, I'm gonna take the snowmobile.
[357:49.31]That's all the questions I had.
[357:52.18]No, I didn't.
[357:55.48]This guy... I don't get it.
[357:58.92]Because I've done that like three times now.
[358:07.00]What's this guy's problem?
[358:08.79]Alright, snowmobile.
[358:09.55]Let's go.
[358:12.89]Actual progress.
[358:19.19]Where is the snowmobile?
[358:26.24]Who goes there?
[358:27.68]Uh, Nancy Drew.
[358:28.71]Nancy Drew shall not pass unless and until she proves herself worthy.
[358:33.63]And how does she do that?
[358:35.37]By hitting the Snow Princess ten times.
[358:38.19]Snowballs only.
[358:39.71]She's talking to herself.
[358:41.18]What are ice balls?
[358:42.88]Snowballs made of ice.
[358:44.42]If you get hit with one, it can knock you out.
[358:46.90]I feel like she has her hand up right now going like this.
[358:49.72]You must be Ollie's daughter, Freddy.
[358:51.16]Freddy!
[358:51.38]I am the Snow Princess.
[358:53.30]She's like talking...
[359:07.06]I'm fucking destroying this kid Right in the face too If you're gonna have a snowball fight
[359:25.04]Don't ever, don't ever aim for the face.
[359:26.78]You know what I mean?
[359:27.70]Especially like a little kid.
[359:30.90]I'm not trying to pinpoint throw this snowball at a kid's face.
[359:35.60]You know, you throw it like, oh, you throw it like towards the ground over there.
[359:39.95]And oh, you miss that way.
[359:42.03]And oh, oh, oh no, you got me.
[359:44.29]Who is throwing fucking baseball pitcher throws of snowballs at a little kid's face?
[359:52.95]No, you're just like, oh, yay, we're playing and I lost.
[359:56.51]Who is doing that?
[359:58.63]Nancy.
[360:00.15]Nancy, slow down.
[360:02.11]Holy smokes.
[360:04.03]Alright.
[360:06.04]Hold still.
[360:07.40]Let me wind up.
[360:10.38]What?
[360:22.66]A nice fishing shack.
[360:23.96]A nice warm one at that.
[360:26.78]Can I walk here?
[360:27.71]I don't understand how this works.
[360:41.23]What kind of weird fish is that?
[360:43.91]I broke my line.
[360:44.79]I'm sorry.
[360:47.88]Wait, is it over?
[360:52.16]No, we're good.
[360:57.96]How do you catch a fish?
[361:00.84]Hello?
[361:41.75]Do I not have bait on the line?
[361:43.43]Is that the problem?
[361:44.01]I need a worm or something.
[361:49.94]Nice.
[361:51.72]I'm measuring it with a ruler.
[362:08.84]Only 16 inches?
[362:14.09]I think I have to get a big one, right?
[362:18.11]That's a big one right there.
[362:18.95]Come on.
[362:26.38]That thing is huge.
[362:27.44]Am I... Am I...
[362:33.64]I'm not holding on.
[362:34.72]What am I doing?
[362:35.26]What's the point of this?
[362:36.42]Oh my god, that's a huge fish.
[362:38.20]Got it.
[362:38.46]What am I supposed to be doing though?
[362:40.23]Okay.
[363:02.09]Get the boot.
[363:02.89]I'm just imagining somebody
[363:22.17]tying a line to a big piece of driftwood, putting it in the water, and then being insanely excited, just pulling it up and being like, oh, dude, what did I get?
[363:34.54]Driftwood!
[363:35.36]And everyone that you're with is cheering, and they take pictures of you with it and stuff.
[363:47.25]Am I supposed to pick up the boot?
[363:53.01]That has a target on it.
[363:53.93]I didn't pick it up though.
[363:59.95]I think I have to get whatever that is.
[364:01.23]I'm just staying up here.
[364:19.36]That can had a target on it.
[364:25.49]Where is it?
[364:29.64]Come on.
[364:35.82]Come on.
[364:40.00]Where's the can?
[364:54.62]It has to be a reason to be down here.
[364:55.86]I snagged a log.
[365:08.08]There goes my line.
[365:09.20]I didn't.
[365:12.84]I just keep getting random fishes and stuff.
[365:25.25]Is this just a fun mini game to play?
[365:26.89]Does this mean anything?
[365:27.75]Does somebody even know?
[365:35.19]Get the bomb.
[365:35.75]I already got it.
[365:36.45]It blows up the shack.
[365:50.18]Itchy.
[365:57.13]I want to see that can again.
[365:58.23]Maybe there's a certain type of fish I have to get.
[366:08.37]The sturgeon was huge.
[366:12.23]I'm surprised that wasn't it.
[366:32.63]Why are you asking us questions about your favorite game?
[366:36.17]True.
[366:36.65]There we go.
[366:39.43]I got it.
[366:41.71]What?
[366:44.07]That was exactly two feet.
[366:46.27]I couldn't pick it up.
[366:50.55]No.
[366:51.07]What?
[366:51.91]Why did it not let me do that?
[366:54.19]You need the can.
[366:55.03]You need the can.
[366:55.69]You need the can.
[366:56.43]You need the can.
[367:03.82]Fuck yeah.
[367:05.96]I didn't need the can.
[367:09.42]I think I need a basket or something.
[367:13.21]Yeah, I need like a basket.
[367:15.11]I need something.
[367:17.89]I can't carry any of this.
[367:24.87]Alright, so I need to come back here later.

[368:27.02]Because I'm going to take a picture with the glow-in-the-dark on.
[368:32.64]I'm surprised it wasn't showing up.
[368:35.40]I want you to see that it actually does glow in the dark.
[368:37.94]So, we'll take a picture.
[368:39.08]I'll go in, like, pitch black room and we'll light it up.
[368:42.24]We'll see.
[368:42.50]Keep an eye on the Grotto Beasts Twitter.

[369:08.39]I'm just I'm searching for six o'clock Pacific
[369:28.40]uh, Resident Evil 4, yeah, that comes out on the 22nd, 23rd, I'll be playing it on launch, I don't know exactly when it comes out, but whenever I stream on that day, we'll play Resident Evil 4, we'll probably be playing that for a couple days in a row, I imagine, at least, because I want to just beat it and play it, because the game's awesome, I need to save this, there we go, alright, it is saved, it is ready, and that's it,
[369:58.34]Thank you for watching.
[369:59.38]D4 was pretty fun.
[370:02.63]It was.
[370:03.23]I'm looking forward to playing it a little bit more to give you a real assessment of it.
[370:25.18]Jimmy Neutron game is required reading.
[370:29.04]Well, as we settle here, after Streamer Rewards, obviously, after Grotto Beasts is out in the wild and people have it and we can... Because that's been something I've been paying attention to a lot recently.
[370:40.42]So once we get that done, I'll be able to play a lot more random stuff.
[370:48.14]My Grotopi shirt is coming this weekend.
[370:49.62]I'm hyped.
[370:50.48]Yeah, the apparel should... I think the apparel is going out to people.
[370:54.74]So people, I think, from my understanding, I think that that's shipping before... That's going to ship before all the cards and stuff.
[371:00.43]So you should get that first.
[371:05.99]Or at least maybe if you ordered individually apparel.
[371:10.52]Yeah, most of this stuff, at least the first batch...
[371:15.57]is um it's coming soon it should be shipping at some point in the next couple weeks yeah thanks again we'll take a picture uh we'll go do it right now
[371:35.85]To show that the thing actually glows in the dark, so there's no... What did somebody say earlier?
[371:41.56]The Tesla truck incident?
[371:47.40]Whatever, it's midnight.
[371:48.46]I'm allowed to snort like a fucking weirdo.
[371:50.38]It's fine.
[371:57.33]Nobody's even here right now.
[371:59.43]Nobody's even here watching.
[372:00.73]It's just me in the room.
[372:01.75]It's me in the monitor.
[372:02.83]That's the only people that heard that.
[372:08.04]Only weirdos snort?
