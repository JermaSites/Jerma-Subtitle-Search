[00:06.26]Hello.
[00:09.74]Just getting the game ready.
[00:10.86]Give me one more sec.
[01:13.71]What up?
[01:17.85]Ready for the late night hours?
[01:18.86]Does it work?
[01:20.34]It's even more fucked up.
[01:33.10]Uh, why is it not going?
[01:39.46]OK.
[01:41.02]Last thing that happened.
[01:43.68]Was going to turn it up a little.
[01:46.50]OK, we had the massive moon.
[01:47.50]We went to.
[01:48.48]600 AD try to get it fixed.
[01:52.30]We were told you gotta go to 65 million BC.
[02:00.23]Because the dream stone that you're looking for is only available.
[02:05.33]I want to put that filter on today shit.
[02:12.15]But yeah, we got to go to get the dream stone and we're gonna go see some cool stuff The only way we can complete the master moon Oh, where's the And somebody's house right there it is
[02:43.64]Make sure I get saved.
[02:45.26]I've got plenty of health, right?
[02:54.69]65 million.
[02:56.87]Mystic Mountains.
[03:01.46]Creamstone Bracelet.
[03:02.64]Masamune.
[03:03.58]Lucky Brand.
[03:04.28]Introverted Extrovert.
[03:06.16]Alright, dude.
[03:14.30]Did you bring Luka?
[03:20.44]Yeah, I like Marle though.
[03:24.54]Good song here.
[03:30.06]You make them the stream tags.
[03:32.36]No, because people will find it actually looking for that and people will think that that's actually me and they'll be looking for a guy that does that.
[03:39.39]They're looking for that and I don't want to do that.
[03:47.32]I guess I could go get Luca.
[03:48.94]Yeah, let's do it.
[03:50.62]I'll go get Luca.
[03:53.50]Should I replace Robo or replace Marle?
[04:12.89]Because we're going to end up replacing somebody anyway soon here.
[04:18.05]Robo is too good.
[04:20.07]It's going to have to be tomorrow.
[04:23.76]Luka needs to level up.
[04:40.87]Should be a cutscene down here.
[04:41.95]You may have skipped a step.
[04:43.57]I heard that some cutscenes have been removed from the Steam version.
[04:48.27]And I was sitting there going, what?
[04:50.82]Is this one of them?
[05:03.46]Another Berserker ring.
[05:09.89]Yeah, because I talked to Melchior and he said, that stone only existed a long time ago.
[05:20.34]There is a cutscene in this version.
[05:21.62]I missed something.
[05:22.52]Really?
[05:22.82]This is not one of them.
[05:30.81]You loaded up the auto save?
[05:32.71]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[05:42.30]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[05:52.99]I'm curious if there's some truth to that, because I did open up the resume.
[05:59.01]Not necessarily load.
[06:00.05]I don't think that matters, though.
[06:07.46]You're not at the cutscene anyways yet.
[06:10.74]We'll see.
[06:14.87]I need some new gear.
[06:21.19]What can they do together?
[06:22.07]Fire Whirl, Supersonic, Cyclone Sweep.
[06:27.11]There we go, okay.
[06:32.40]Does she not know anything with Robo?
[06:37.22]Fire Whirl?
[06:38.68]Any tech points, I think.
[06:48.66]Alright, don't get killed by the little shit dinosaurs.
[06:51.96]Obtain horn.
[07:06.39]There we go.
[07:06.89]Fire punch, dual tech.
[07:09.33]Fire sword.
[07:10.01]Actually might need... I got... Oh, never mind.
[07:16.63]I have 32.
[07:16.85]This is exactly why I bought all these.
[07:28.34]It's Masamune.
[07:31.28]You know, the reason why I call it Masamune is that's how I've called it since I was like 10.
[07:35.51]So it just kind of, it stuck with me kind of forever.
[07:42.93]Uh, let's do Fire Sword.
[07:51.79]Damn.
[07:53.09]That was, that was insane.
[07:56.13]What just happened?
[07:59.97]Oh, I turned on auto battle.
[08:07.57]Skip that.
[08:11.66]I kind of want to fight this because it's a ton of experience.
[08:15.20]What the fuck?
[08:16.12]Oh my god, that goes too fast.
[08:18.52]The auto battle was still on.
[08:22.37]Try this one.
[08:32.56]Is the game too easy?
[08:35.16]No, I... I just... here's the thing, I know a lot about what to do.
[08:42.36]It's a lot of pre-baking heals and later on the game does get pretty difficult, but this was never a particularly difficult game.
[08:51.19]It was more the experience that was fun.
[08:56.38]There are a handful of encounters that are, I'd say, like two-thirds into the game that are very, very difficult.
[09:03.51]And if you're not leveled up and you don't have the right gear, then you're kind of screwed.
[09:06.93]I remember when you played Super Auto Pets Battle, when you were hungover, it was so funny.
[09:16.64]Oh, you mean the tournament that I was in?
[09:18.12]I didn't know even know how to play the game.
[09:23.49]how many of those okay how many of those like Ludwig tournaments did I just like roll out of bed not know how to play the game and lose instantly yes nice
[09:55.02]Reptite scales.
[09:55.98]Cold blood.
[09:56.58]Hard to beat.
[09:57.10]What are you going to do?
[10:03.59]Monster Rancher again?
[10:04.39]You are going to be so happy to hear this.
[10:08.99]I recently reinstalled Monster Rancher 1 and 2.
[10:13.27]And I was really considering a Let's
[10:18.81]Let's be PG.
[10:21.17]Let's go.
[10:23.70]Try to get all the way through the whole game.
[10:25.74]Actually.
[10:27.14]As like a late night kind of thing.
[10:29.06]That's my philosophy here going forward with this.
[10:32.64]I want to be, I want to do a lot of later night stuff.
[10:35.00]That's the longer form kind of games.
[10:41.86]So that will be something that we go to after, let's say, two or three hours of something else.
[10:47.21]I think that's kind of fun.
[10:48.05]I like that idea.
[10:53.67]You want to see pretty stone?
[10:54.91]Redstone Chief has.
[10:55.95]What happened to my cursor?
[11:02.79]Hey, what's going on here?
[11:09.12]Um, I can't move.
[11:16.16]That was rude.
[11:29.84]Well, the game just crashed.
[11:32.64]Something was wrong with that one.
[11:34.64]Uh, well... I guess I can... See if the theory of, uh... Is that the right save file?
[11:48.45]Yeah, I lost access to my controller and then that was very odd.
[12:00.60]Okay.
[12:05.94]Load game.
[12:09.44]This is it.
[12:10.40]A rare red rock.
[12:15.28]Right?
[12:25.04]Kind of sucks I have to do all that again, but whatever.
[12:29.48]Best version is still the DS version emulated.
[12:31.42]That's probably true.
[12:35.92]I just saw that it was on Steam and I saw that with the right tweaks it ran okay.
[12:42.08]And obviously having it on Steam is just... You know, it's in your library, it's in your library forever.
[12:56.79]I am a sucker for the original SNES version because somebody said the colors.
[12:59.93]Yeah.
[13:05.24]OK, so this is I'm glad that hey, you know what the world universe spoke and this this is correct now.
[13:15.92]So here we go.
[13:18.64]Those things, they're all green and scaly.
[13:20.24]Get a... get a triple here.
[13:53.47]Did we ever figure out what that's from?
[14:07.64]I don't think it's Augie and the cockroaches.
[14:09.20]I don't think it is.
[14:11.48]We're outnumbered.
[14:13.10]Yo!
[14:54.25]Yeah!
[14:58.29]Who is that?
[14:58.97]Her combat capabilities far exceed those of ordinary humans.
[15:06.53]This shift in behavior corresponds to an unfavorable change in targets.
[15:17.73]Oh, yo!
[15:18.41]There she is!
[15:27.60]That's a great move.
[15:31.46]Impeccable hair and makeup for a cavewoman.
[15:53.08]Is he trying to pick a fight?
[15:55.69]Chrono!
[15:55.95]Isla.
[16:22.43]We keep it default.
[16:23.37]Looks like somebody's got a new friend.
[16:28.59]I... I... I don't... I mean... I... Yes?
[16:56.74]An explanation cannot be formulated within the bounds of her understanding.
[17:28.29]We're from way after the day after tomorrow.
[17:32.02]She's turning into Otto?
[17:36.06]Are you funny?
[17:37.42]I don't like funny person.
[17:38.82]And I like Otto.
[17:43.02]It's no use.
[17:44.88]You come village, talk and eat, dance, drink, fun.
[17:50.30]We'd love to go, but we're looking for some dream stone right now.
[17:53.70]Stone?
[17:54.48]Stone everywhere.
[17:55.35]Here, there, village.
[17:56.87]Isla give you many, many stone.
[18:00.15]Ayoka village this way.
[18:01.39]Follow Isla.
[18:04.67]I love she runs at all fours.
[18:05.83]It's so funny.
[18:15.09]I love her music too.
[18:29.53]Let's get a big move here.
[18:44.05]Good.
[18:54.47]Running on all fours just hits different.
[19:06.11]That's a good level up.
[19:07.87]Good level up.
[19:17.26]Is that a kill?
[19:23.13]Are they resistant to lightning?
[19:34.77]I wish I could move the... Can I move the health bars?
[19:36.71]I almost would rather them not be there or have them be over their heads.
[19:57.39]I want the experience.
[20:01.43]You can change them.
[20:01.97]Let me see what they look like on other stuff.
[20:18.49]I've never seen a crate with Robo.
[20:22.72]There, now that makes more sense.
[20:31.00]We're good.
[20:50.46]Yeah, we saw this already.
[20:51.40]Let's heal.
[20:59.87]So I will say I am making a commitment to the Isla fans.
[21:08.73]Isla is going to be a permanent member of the party.
[21:10.65]It's been... I've never really done that.

[25:19.12]That is a lobster.
[25:19.84]I never even noticed that.
[25:35.73]This fluid contains immeasurable impurities.
[25:43.15]Tee hee, Crono.
[25:44.01]You've got to try some of this.
[25:47.17]Okay.
[25:51.32]What's that?

[27:42.33]Good... good morning.
[27:44.07]It appears that liquid induces peculiar behavior in humans.
[27:51.15]Oh, my head.
[27:51.73]I did what last night, liar?
[27:55.13]Why does my head hurt like this?
[28:00.39]Hey, where did these footprints come from?
[28:03.53]It's gone!
[28:05.49]The gate key is gone.
[28:06.87]The thief must have left these prints.
[28:11.96]Without the key, we're stuck here forever.
[28:14.90]This is bad.
[28:15.48]We have to go see Isla.

[28:47.50]What?
[28:47.92]Stole?
[28:48.80]Must be Reptite.

[32:12.30]It's been a while.
[32:21.71]Oh, there he is.

[32:30.15]Say now.
[32:33.46]Kino, sorry, I, uh... Kino, take chrono stuff.
[32:37.56]Why take?
[32:40.81]Kino like Isla best.
[32:42.29]Isla say like Chrono.
[32:43.57]Kino mad.
[32:47.80]Madam Isla, violence is never the best solution.
[32:51.58]Kino know why Isla hit.
[32:56.50]Isla no like Kino.
[32:58.84]No, Isla like Kino best.
[33:00.64]So Isla no want Kino do bad thing.

[33:43.91]There you go, there's a good profile for you.
[33:48.37]Madam Isla, my apologies for implying you may have been out of control.
[33:56.46]In that order.
[34:05.07]Follow Reptite.
[34:05.79]Get Chrono.
[34:06.37]Thing.
[34:06.61]Let's go get Thing.
[34:19.22]Oh my god, that scared the shit out of me.
[34:22.48]I'm sorry, Isla does not have a weapon.
[34:28.12]She uses her bare hands.
[34:38.53]It is no tech either.
[34:40.01]She learns it later.
[34:42.91]Can she learn magic?
[34:45.42]Does Specchio teach Isla magic?
[34:47.14]I don't remember.
[34:47.56]Oh, I want to go on the menu and look at the health bar thing.
[35:09.35]I love her attack.
[35:10.03]It's like a soccer throw from sidelines.
[35:18.59]Okay.
[35:19.23]Battle speed, battle message, cursor memory, help messages.
[35:28.40]Battle cursor.
[35:29.58]Change the cursor position?
[35:30.80]What does that mean?
[35:43.21]Maybe not.
[35:52.76]I think it's fine.
[35:53.30]It's in graphics.
[36:00.44]Just the screen size from the menu.
[36:26.01]Wait, we got Raid from the Banana Bros?
[36:27.63]Oh, bananas two a day.
[36:31.99]Alright.
[36:33.61]Welcome, Banana Bros.
[36:41.10]Potassium power.
[36:43.74]The banana bunch.
[36:59.91]Playing some Chrono Trigger.
[37:00.91]Just chillin'.
[37:07.33]Isla learned Kiss.
[37:08.55]Ooh.
[37:09.27]Yeah, thanks for the raid, though.
[37:10.05]Welcome, guys.
[37:12.17]Just hanging out.
[37:27.22]I haven't used any of these.
[37:30.99]And I think... Alright, please correct me if I'm wrong here.
[37:35.81]Should I just dump all the strength capsules into Isla?
[37:43.94]If I know that Isla is going to be permanent.
[37:51.90]She will max out early anyways.
[37:54.16]How early?
[38:00.00]Just dump them all into Chrono.
[38:06.64]Eyeless Steroid's good.
[38:07.76]Big, strong.
[38:12.34]I don't think I'm going to, like, max out, like, level 99 people.
[38:15.51]Okay, let me ask a question.
[38:17.65]So when you get to the end of the game and you do all the side content, that's probably what... I'm not going to do, like, new game plus or anything.
[38:24.89]How quickly will she max out strength?
[38:32.82]She's already got 39.
[38:33.30]Chrono is the hitter.
[38:37.90]I think they're both really good.
[38:45.79]I always use these items in the main character.
[38:48.29]You won't max at this playthrough.
[38:49.59]Level 61 she maxes.
[38:54.37]Because if it's not a case of... I'm not going to grind levels or anything.
[38:58.07]I think I just want to dump points into her.
[39:00.49]Chrono would be good no matter what, yeah.
[39:02.93]I think I'm going to do it.
[39:11.88]Get her up there very quickly.
[39:12.80]I don't think I'm going to see super maxed out levels.
[39:17.80]So, let's just go for it.
[39:24.21]Can't take it back now.
[39:26.85]I also want speed to be given to... Probably Robo.
[39:35.83]But I don't know.
[39:36.61]Is Robo going to be permanent?
[39:48.98]I don't know.
[39:53.21]There's two other characters that I think I would want to have here.
[39:55.56]I guess I could spread it out.
[39:57.38]He's so slow.
[40:05.42]Get rid of the redhead.
[40:06.56]That's Chrono.
[40:10.04]His name is in the title.
[40:12.97]Probably Frog, yeah.
[40:14.35]I think Chrono Isla Frog would be what I would probably end up doing.
[40:21.71]Or...
[40:25.64]Uh, Frog Robo?
[40:28.68]Let's not talk about anything.
[40:32.64]Excuse me?
[40:33.02]I don't know.
[40:35.61]I don't know what my permanent party is going to be.
[40:36.99]Chrono Frog Robo.
[40:46.33]That's the trifecta.
[40:48.09]That's the triple trifecta.
[40:53.34]That's what I always used to use when I was younger.
[41:01.03]Or it would be... It would be Redacted Frog Marl.
[41:11.00]Redacted Frog Marl.
[41:18.48]Chrono Robo Marl.
[41:19.75]That's good too.
[41:25.91]Why does nobody like Luka?
[41:27.67]Luka is great.
[41:28.53]I just... In my tier list of all the characters in the game, they're all S. But she's just not all the way up on S. It's unfortunate because I genuinely like all the characters.
[41:44.87]I think they're wonderful.
[41:54.00]A lot of fire resist.
[41:55.01]That's also true too.
[41:55.85]I gotta get some new gear.
[42:17.04]I need to get those petals.
[42:28.60]Luka doesn't have a heal.
[42:31.08]No, but she makes everybody else way stronger.
[42:37.70]Some of her fire buff moves are insane.
[42:46.63]Opinions on Chrono Cross.
[42:47.69]I gave the kind of Chrono Cross take the other night.
[42:54.89]It's a great, wonderful, beautiful, complete mess.
[43:09.61]I like Chrono or Hyperlink locked with... Yeah, just listen to the album.
[43:21.56]Okay, who do you think my favorite character in that game is?
[43:24.00]You guys probably already know.
[43:25.08]Do I even have to say it?
[43:26.54]Out of the 40 characters, what is one of my permanent characters in Chrono Cross?
[43:33.15]Someone's going to get it immediately.
[43:39.68]no no yeah yo somebody got it no no you didn't no no somebody got it but you didn't say the name it's mojo yeah uh mojoy actually mojo mojoy mojo is the best character in that whole game
[44:09.27]Let me see if I can still do it.
[44:17.12]That was kind of close, right?
[44:18.62]Those of you that played Chrono Cross.
[44:26.47]I think that was kind of close without a single reference point at all.
[44:29.65]And it's been like 25 years.
[44:45.16]Yeah, he's a giant voodoo doll.
[44:47.74]He's like a scarecrow, he's made out of straw.
[44:49.76]It's the coolest character in the game.
[44:52.20]He's got really cool moves too.
[44:53.34]There we go.
[45:04.56]Three, three forty four.
[45:07.78]Three forty four, are you serious?
[45:21.88]I'm getting petals and fangs too, so that's good.
[45:28.18]I thought you were going to hide this from me.
[45:45.00]Yeah, and it's really easy to, I talked about this last night, Chrono Cross, there are 40 playable characters in the game, and some of them are, be in this exact moment at this exact time, with this exact item, and if you're not there, redo the whole game, because you can't get it.
[46:04.81]Mojo is one of those characters.
[46:07.05]You have one screen worth of time to get this one item.
[46:11.50]You have to bring it at this exact moment.
[46:14.18]If you miss the moment, you can never get the character.
[46:16.54]It's so easy to miss the whole thing.
[46:21.64]Is this game on SNES worth a hundred bucks?
[46:24.60]The original cartridge?
[46:25.72]The actual cartridge Chrono Trigger?
[46:28.32]Probably.
[46:28.70]I would imagine it would probably be worth more.
[46:40.41]I don't know how rare the cartridge is, but that's a really cool thing to own.
[46:45.30]There's only one on eBay right now.
[46:58.11]Damn.
[47:13.02]A lot of them are over 200.
[47:16.14]I don't know if there's condition ratings on cartridges.
[47:20.25]I mean, is it possible that the cartridge isn't?
[47:23.55]I don't know if there's certain ratings for them or how good the quality of the materials inside.
[47:28.29]I don't know.
[47:29.75]It's been a long time since I bought a cartridge.
[47:37.09]The game looks and sounds beautiful, but tragically I don't like round-based fighting.
[47:41.56]Yeah, Holly just said it too.
[47:42.98]There's a... There's a mode that's the default mode, essentially, which is called Active.
[47:50.06]You still have to select things in a menu, but nothing stops.
[47:53.93]Makes the game a lot harder and a lot more action-based.
[47:59.89]It was on the first stream I did.
[48:01.47]I just turned it off because I figured as a streaming device, it's easier to kind of go on the menu and just say a couple things.
[48:11.19]But you can make it a little bit harder.
[48:13.53]I want that.
[48:19.68]Nice.
[48:23.72]I permanently envy the guy that got the Roblox birthday party stream.
[48:33.72]Let's, uh... I forgot that Isla has heals.
[48:50.57]It's actually pretty good, too.
[48:53.65]I don't think she gets really high magic scaling, whatever, but... It's definitely good enough.
[49:03.96]She is nasty.
[49:06.79]She's nasty.
[49:24.78]Any Breath of Fire games?
[49:25.98]I don't think so.
[49:34.17]JRPGs, I don't really... I don't play a whole lot of them.
[49:40.06]Because I'm the same way.
[49:40.82]I don't really like... I'm not a big massive fan of turn-based content.
[49:52.01]But they are really fun.
[49:55.43]Especially specific ones.
[49:58.07]Alright, we're in the lair.
[50:12.27]Oh, that's right.
[50:12.65]You have to go specifically... Okay.
[50:14.85]I don't want to skip all these fights.
[50:17.89]Right.
[50:19.70]Actually, you know what?
[50:36.62]Let's spin it.
[50:37.78]Might as well just get rid of them all.
[50:50.41]Dark Souls stuff, you might like that.
[50:52.13]I love it FromSoftware games.
[50:55.99]You would be correct.
[51:01.87]That's kind of chonky.
[51:12.94]Hmm, we don't need to do that yet.
[51:16.50]Hmm.
[51:16.90]Lightning?
[51:17.86]Yeah.
[51:21.03]A lot of health.
[51:43.87]I like that pose.
[51:44.67]Reminds me of the rat emote.
[51:54.76]I've seen Expedition 33.
[52:01.04]You know what I would like for recommendations for games like this?
[52:04.60]Games that... See how I don't... There's no random battles.
[52:11.11]I like this style of no random battle.
[52:16.18]You have to bump into something.
[52:17.34]Mario RPG was like this.
[52:18.78]This game is like this.
[52:20.30]Frontal Cross is like this.
[52:34.98]It's so much better like this.
[52:35.96]It is.
[52:36.22]I don't need to do lightning.
[52:39.18]I need to get this.
[52:44.07]Then you need to do robo-tackle.
[52:50.63]Saga Front 2.
[52:56.72]Most games are like this now.
[52:57.78]The Final Fantasy VII Remake, low-key.
[53:02.12]low key the final is it is there no random battles that's right they redid the whole system I probably would like it alright I'm coming up on a break and I'm going for at least another hour I'm good I'm chilling I'm having a good time after this fight I'm gonna take a break oh
[53:35.02]Remake is actually great.
[53:40.26]I bet you it is.
[53:45.48]Holy shit, that was a big one.
[53:52.84]I've seen a little bit.
[53:53.64]I have not seen tons of it, but a little bit enough clips to be like this looks kind of cool.
[54:00.87]Is it long winded though?
[54:03.15]Is it a long winded game?
[54:06.78]Stone Helm.
[54:12.22]It's more of a suedo sequel.
[54:16.84]It's like 100 hours or something, isn't it?
[54:18.80]I'll be right back.
[54:28.00]Suedo.
[54:32.28]This could be one of the last breaks of the night or last ad breaks.
[54:38.11]Depends on how I feel in like an hour.
[54:39.99]But I'll be right back.
[54:41.01]See you in a few.
[55:16.13]Thanks for watching!
[56:37.81]Alright, here we go.
[57:58.42]Alright, let's do this.
[58:55.10]How you doing?
[59:02.99]I got 19,000 gold.
[59:03.75]That's kind of a lot, isn't it?
[59:11.13]Welcome back.
[59:14.15]Someone's going to freak out.
[59:15.47]It's me.
[59:16.69]Mouse on the screen.
[59:17.73]Gotta go.
[59:18.33]Let's fight them all.
[59:31.46]Blow him out of the water, supersonic spin.
[59:45.83]Beautiful.
[59:48.27]It's all clear.
[60:02.95]So what was Suedo?
[60:06.07]You know when you say words the same way you've said them since you were younger and they just stay even if you know they're wrong?
[60:17.34]What's the something something we bend the world to our will something something?
[60:37.45]A bit about a treasure chest.
[60:42.60]Damn, that's two crit flashes.
[60:44.18]I forgot about a treasure chest.
[60:57.49]I'm kind of blowing through these.
[61:05.12]Oops.
[61:06.34]Oops.
[61:11.92]I kind of need to... Yeah, a boss is coming up here.
[61:14.95]I forget how hard the boss is.
[61:17.15]How hard is this boss coming up?
[61:23.09]You play the bazaar?
[61:26.50]I don't... I'm not really a big card... I'm not good at card games.
[61:30.38]It was the infamous Hearthstone stream where I was so not confident of making a mistake in front of chat that I... every single move I freaked out and said, what do I do?
[61:41.53]Is this right?
[61:42.01]Is this wrong?
[61:43.39]And I'd lost like every game and it was just embarrassing.
[61:46.64]What I need to do is just not even think or look or care
[62:06.39]I'm not the type... I'm not a strategist.
[62:09.19]I'm actually really not.
[62:11.24]I've played a lot of Hearthstone Battlegrounds, but that's more of... That's the less kind of card game to me.
[62:31.96]funny if you put me in front of a crowd of 25 000 people in a sold-out arena you gave me a microphone you said hey you you gotta you gotta work this crowd for 10 minutes I'll be like give me that give me it done easy you make me play hearthstone in front of like a room of a few thousand people or up to like that same group
[62:59.61]If you... I would be... I would freak out.
[63:04.23]If you give me an iPad and put me in front of that same group and instead of like, hey, work the crowd, it's... Show them you playing Hearthstone.
[63:11.45]My face would turn purple.
[63:14.20]Be like... So this is... I don't know.
[63:17.62]What's this guy's name?
[63:18.34]I don't even know what he does.
[63:19.14]It says he steals... He swaps mana and health.
[63:23.40]I...
[63:29.78]Alright, so coming up soon in the program, we've got quite a show for you today.
[63:50.90]I couldn't do both of those?
[63:55.29]Hey, like I always said, in life, have three things that you like so you're never disappointed.
[64:06.26]You like animals?
[64:07.70]Good.
[64:08.92]You could be a vet.
[64:11.28]You like computers?
[64:12.62]Good.
[64:13.50]You can build computers.
[64:14.46]You can work with computers.
[64:16.40]You want to write a book?
[64:17.86]Write a fucking book.
[64:18.97]Go write a book.
[64:21.42]Have three things that you like.
[64:23.66]So as long as one of them works out, you're not disappointed.
[64:27.62]And make sure they are varying skill, varying education.
[64:33.24]I'm not talking about like, oh man, I want to be a seasoned author.
[64:37.24]I want to be a celebrated singer.
[64:40.65]Or I want to be the president.
[64:43.37]Well, no.
[64:45.15]You got to tier them out a little bit.
[64:57.60]No more than three?
[64:59.30]If you got three plus things that you really are interested in, that's great.
[65:04.17]You're ahead of the game.
[65:05.07]Alright, we're learning tons of shit here.
[65:07.01]This is a lottery winner giving career advice?
[65:20.98]I mean, that's true to an extent.
[65:24.02]But you gotta remember, I was like 27.
[65:28.02]when I really got my kind of foot in the door on YouTube.
[65:32.61]I was in my late 20s.
[65:33.67]I was like 26, 27.
[65:39.55]I was approaching 30 when I was, you know, the channel really took off.
[65:50.30]So I was already kind of doing other things that I was like, oh, I actually kind of like this.
[65:56.35]So it still fits that build.
[66:06.38]I need Aether.
[66:25.02]Yeah, I knew I always wanted to work in something to do with video.
[66:28.56]The video... My three things were video, doesn't matter what it was, I was like, I want to do editing or... Working with video production or that was like one of them.
[66:39.63]Animals were another one.
[66:40.39]I always thought it was like cool to work with animals or... Try to get into that career of... Like working with dogs and cats or whatever.
[66:51.59]Computers was it was a close one.
[66:52.93]I always thought it was like a really not necessarily building them.
[66:57.74]But and not programming either, because I couldn't fucking do that.
[67:03.46]What in the world could those filthy apes have crafted something this advanced?
[67:09.36]That requires a lot of studying.
[67:10.90]Yeah, I was prepared to do that though.
[67:16.53]Really, though, the YouTube thing really took off at the very moment where I was considering to really get into that field for one or two others.
[67:29.32]Even the first, like, year or two of YouTube, I still was kind of like, oh, is this going to work out?
[67:33.60]Maybe it will.
[67:34.10]I don't know.
[67:35.32]Remember, money was, you could, there was no money in YouTube.
[67:39.24]That was not really there.
[67:42.38]It was, I want to say, once like Machinima came around.
[67:48.80]That was... That was like into the early 2010s.
[67:52.87]That was like 2011, 2012.
[67:54.33]2013 is when people were really getting like partnered and making ad revenue on YouTube.
[68:00.63]That was not a thing.
[68:02.85]I was doing it mostly as a hobby.
[68:04.18]Like I just thought it was cool.
[68:06.34]The money really and the ads and all that shit really came a couple, like a year or two later.
[68:12.70]Yeah, getting a machinima contract was like getting a golden ticket.
[68:15.46]You want to talk about like winning the lottery?
[68:17.06]That was getting the golden ticket in your chocolate bar.
[68:20.88]It was like, I've got a machinima partnership.
[68:24.58]I've got a golden sunshine in my... Oh yeah, it was a huge fucking deal.
[68:30.16]And then obviously we all know what happened with that company.
[68:33.17]It was kind of a fucking mess.
[68:37.69]Um, yeah, but I mean, I was very lucky.
[68:39.59]I was.
[68:41.92]But I started a lot later than a lot of people do now.
[68:54.53]You drank the fizzy lifting drink.
[69:00.23]Azala.
[69:02.49]And so the hairless apes arrive.
[69:04.85]And these new ones appear cut from a finer cloth than Isla.
[69:09.10]Did I say yes?
[69:09.52]What if he disappears?
[69:33.86]Lies!
[69:34.56]Do you take me for a fool?
[69:36.04]No one would talk so easily if that were true.
[69:38.66]Or perhaps this might loosen your tongue.
[69:44.21]Come, Nisbel.
[69:49.65]This is the eat... eat apples and bananas song?
[69:57.01]You just ruined the game for me.
[70:00.48]You just ruined the game.
[70:02.86]I'm not going to be able to hear that song ever again.
[70:05.00]This is a boss.
[70:05.62]I need to concentrate.
[70:07.36]I'd like to eat, eat, eat, have a banana.
[70:16.08]Oh, you motherfucker.
[70:19.09]Alright.
[70:19.47]I got to.
[70:19.93]Here we go.
[70:23.83]Try the new move.
[70:30.89]That did not hurt at all.
[70:31.87]Okay, good.
[70:35.43]Alright.
[70:36.16]Let's do... How do you do lightning?
[70:43.20]There we go.
[70:51.07]Oof.
[71:02.92]Who needs this more?
[71:05.90]I don't know.
[71:26.26]Whoa, that hurts a lot.
[71:28.69]Oh, fuck.
[71:29.11]I'm freaking out.
[71:29.91]I actually might die.
[71:33.89]What do I want to do?
[71:34.73]Good thing I turned on the fucking waiting.
[71:36.21]That was a mistake.
[72:02.47]I need Cure Beam on Isla right now.
[72:06.55]Alright, we're good.
[72:07.11]Everything's fine.
[72:10.87]Not fine.
[72:11.47]Not fine.
[72:12.23]Not fine.
[72:12.55]I think they're dead.
[72:20.86]I need something better than that.
[72:22.36]Where are my mid potions?
[72:42.33]Keep lowering that defense.
[72:43.29]I want to do the, yeah, the double.
[72:46.31]Drill kick was more, spinning kick was more, I think.
[72:47.99]Do it again.
[73:00.74]Drill kick.
[73:05.76]Nice.
[73:15.18]Ouch.
[73:15.84]Spread it around.
[73:23.41]He's dead.
[73:27.63]He's not.

[74:26.41]That's a new move.
[74:28.97]There it is.
[74:29.71]GG.
[74:32.36]Kind of close, but I got it.
[74:51.76]The apes beat Nisbel?
[74:55.22]Give thing back, Crono, now Very well, you've won today But know that we reptites are the rulers of this world Will not surrender to you filthy apes No damage detected, the gate key appears operational What was I saying?
[75:22.97]Oh yeah, like, have three things that you like at least.
[75:25.55]Because then... If two or three of them don't work out, then you will only be disappointed to an extent.
[75:43.22]Bleh, was she puking?
[75:48.26]Chrono leave, no Chrono Island, no fun.
[75:56.27]You're saying you liked computers, but not programming them or building them, just looking at them.
[76:01.67]That hurt.
[76:02.67]Because that's like actually what I said.
[76:04.13]I just look with my mouth open.
[76:07.31]Yeah, I just like looking.
[76:09.23]I just like computers, I guess.
[76:10.89]I just like looking at them.
[76:24.10]I think I just wanted to, like, work in a computer store.
[76:26.62]Because I loved the idea of graphics cards and... Oh, wow, this CPU is so fast.
[76:35.74]Cool, an SSD?
[76:37.24]Nice.
[76:37.66]I don't know, I just thought it was a cool concept.
[76:49.60]Sorry, Chrono.
[76:50.61]You know, try to be strong now.
[76:51.95]Even more strong, Chrono.
[76:55.31]So you wanted to be a GameStop employee.
[77:00.39]I think that'd be like... There's nothing wrong with that.
[77:08.62]Even more strong chrono.
[77:14.60]Being able to talk about games and give recommendations and stuff.
[77:21.08]Fake computer fan.
[77:26.60]I can only imagine, though.
[77:28.52]I know a lot of people that work have worked in retail.
[77:31.54]I've seen I've never worked in retail before.
[77:33.32]And people say, wow, good.
[77:38.62]Glad that's never happened to you.
[77:42.83]Time for another party.
[77:51.17]Game journalism, Andy.
[77:54.51]I just like talking about stuff.
[77:58.85]So, like, if somebody came in, I don't know, I'd just be in... Oh, so what do you think?
[78:02.62]What should my son get for his birthday?
[78:05.56]Let me tell you something.
[78:07.49]Super Mario RPG.
[78:09.25]Legend of the Seven Stars.
[78:10.45]How much time do you have, ma'am?
[78:12.22]Oh, actually, I've got to get... It's a game that's got adventure.
[78:14.66]It's got... Bowser is there, and he fights you, but he doesn't fight you.
[78:19.54]He's actually kind of... He's good in the middle of the game.
[78:22.98]But also, the battle system is... It's the first isometric game, actually, for the Super Nintendo.
[78:27.35]I actually have to leave.
[78:28.43]I've got a place to be.
[78:29.47]Just hold on.
[78:29.83]Let me just tell you.
[78:30.73]The first isometric game from Nintendo.
[78:34.67]They did a fake 3D that made it seem like it was... Your son's going to love it.
[78:39.49]Okay, but how about Madden?
[78:42.30]No.
[78:43.30]Oh, no.
[78:44.38]No!
[78:45.34]Oh, don't buy him, Madden.
[78:49.14]Your son needs to play Mario RPG, Mischief Makers, Banjo-Kazooie 2, and Donkey Kong Country.
[78:57.36]In that order.
[79:03.18]I'm sorry, but can I speak to the manager?
[79:06.20]No, we don't have one.
[79:07.60]We don't have one today.
[79:09.36]I'm the only fucking guy here.
[79:10.98]I have to do everything.
[79:14.88]Anything else I can help you with?
[79:16.02]Sorry, I just swore at you.
[79:20.20]See all those boxes back there?
[79:21.66]Yeah, I have to do that too.
[79:23.08]I'm the only fucking person in the store.
[79:26.32]What's up with that, by the way?
[79:38.47]It's the beginning of a 2000s movie?
[79:44.61]Yeah, it is another 2000s movie intro.
[79:49.71]And then the main character is that GameStop employee sitting on the curb in front of the GameStop smoking a cigarette with the best buddy.
[79:56.46]And is it like after hours?
[79:59.42]Is it not?
[79:59.74]There's like guitar riffs in the background.
[80:01.30]They're like talking about life.
[80:12.32]And it's Dane Cook.
[80:21.46]Yeah, Dane Cook was every single one of these characters.
[80:29.01]No, not Adam Sandler.
[80:30.19]These were Dane Cook movies.
[80:34.53]How many movies... Dane Cook was in like three movies about like being a waiter, right?
[80:38.91]Or working at a restaurant.
[80:40.57]They were like three Dane Cook restaurant movies.
[80:43.78]Or am I just making this up?
[80:55.10]It was Waiting.
[80:56.96]Was it only Waiting?
[80:58.30]Waiting was Ryan Reynolds?
[81:04.27]What?
[81:04.69]No, there was another restaurant movie.
[81:16.00]There was one where he was a chef.
[81:21.00]Good luck, Chuck, and employee of the month.
[81:22.68]I think it was employee of the month.
[81:28.38]There was a couple of store movies.
[81:30.62]Northernlion would know this.
[81:32.99]Yeah, he probably would.
[81:36.12]Not Ratatouille.
[81:37.16]Ratatouille is animated.
[81:45.38]Dan Cook was the chef in Waiting.
[81:49.37]Oh.
[81:50.85]I think that's right.
[81:51.63]Do you think you could beat him?
[81:59.91]Do you think I could beat Northernlion in a movie trivia contest?
[82:05.74]No, that's a level 10 dweeb versus level 99 boss.
[82:08.92]That's not going to happen.
[82:11.72]Are you serious?
[82:12.26]Guys, every answer for every question would be the Super Mario movie, not the new one, the old one.
[82:39.25]Come again.
[82:39.65]Alright, so we'll be back.
[82:42.17]We got the stone.
[82:43.93]We got the stone.
[82:49.47]I did get the stone, right?
[82:50.43]So now I bring this back.
[82:58.90]Yep, dream stone.
[83:02.48]Should I try to get the gear though?
[83:09.86]I can always come back for it.
[83:13.42]You know the fifth element?
[83:14.50]Yeah.
[83:17.46]I actually probably do know quite a bit more movies than I've let on in TV shows.
[83:26.47]It's all knowledge from the 90s and late 90s.
[83:30.05]Pick one.
[83:35.00]One million dollars or an annoying orange t-shirt?
[83:40.06]Uh, can I have both?
[83:47.40]I could go up there.
[83:48.08]I want to do the sword.
[83:49.82]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[84:07.79]So anyways guys, pick three things.
[84:10.83]Mine were computers, acting, comedy, singing, dancing, pets, pets, animals, cars, cards,
[84:38.30]Corn Farming Corn
[85:00.98]Remember back in the day, where you didn't even need to have, like, a job?
[85:03.84]You could just be, like, a guy that had a fucking 10-gallon hat on and, like, scammed people at poker until somebody shot you?
[85:11.72]That's crazy.
[85:23.53]Like, oh, welcome to the saloon!
[85:26.05]Ow, you wanted me to come and sit at our table?
[85:29.73]Partner?
[85:31.34]I'm gonna scam people in poker and that's how I make my silver coins.
[85:35.90]Somebody shoots me with a shotgun after like fucking seven years of doing that.
[85:44.87]Or just like fill up fucking bottles from the river and put like two drops of food dye in it.
[85:51.25]What I have here is a miracle hair growth serum and it will make you Randy and your woman will love it, I promise you.
[86:01.34]That guy made fucking like a hundred million dollars in this time period with inflation.
[86:16.89]I'm a bounty hunter.
[86:21.42]That guy that sold you that fucked up river water?
[86:25.32]Yeah, I'm coming back with his head.
[86:28.09]I'm coming back and you're gonna pay me for it.
[86:38.75]He longed for the Wild West.
[86:50.82]Yeah, I get the stone.
[86:51.56]I got it.
[86:56.58]Ah, dream stone.
[86:57.82]I've forgotten how beautifully it shines.
[87:00.68]As a man who knows the secret to working that stone, he resides near Medina, a village of fiends.
[87:14.71]I think I can beat him now.
[87:15.51]Let's try it.
[87:28.62]I can beat him.
[87:31.93]How many potions do I have?
[87:56.54]have enough don't kill him we're good does he be magic
[88:27.39]Got it.
[88:29.57]Ooh, that's good.
[88:30.35]What can I say?
[88:30.85]I'm the master of war!
[88:57.45]He just gets harder and harder, by the way.
[89:09.33]Did he change?
[89:10.73]Not yet.
[89:11.01]Okay, now we bring this back to... What are we talking about?
[89:21.68]We're talking about the Wild West.
[89:28.86]So, again, what I want to make sure, rewind back, this is going back like fucking 500 years.
[89:34.59]Which is how I wound up teaching you guys.
[89:38.53]And I'll make sure you have three things that you lack.
[89:42.34]One, scamming people.
[89:44.90]Second one for me is drinking a lot.
[89:49.83]And three is finding a guy and bringing him back.
[89:54.85]So that's what I like.
[89:57.11]And you might be different for you.
[89:58.73]You might like all kinds of other things.
[90:00.79]I don't know.
[90:01.33]I don't know you personally.
[90:06.52]But I mean, like Terry, I know you know the three things you like.
[90:13.33]I was going to say like, like sleeping.
[90:17.97]Like the guy that just like sleeps with the wheat in his mouth.
[90:24.61]And you like to rob trains.
[90:27.69]I know that about you.
[90:33.41]I know you killed that guy over a carrot.
[90:37.71]So you must like carrots a lot too, Terry.
[90:42.08]All I'm saying is everybody here, we're all doing things.
[90:46.66]Take it from me.
[90:47.41]And you just... The horse!
[90:50.87]You take off into the sunset.
[91:00.10]He's got a metal plate in his jaw?
[91:08.61]What is this bit?
[91:09.45]This bit is... It's not a streamer, it's... You'll get it.
[91:16.67]Just think about it for another minute.
[91:19.51]Alright, we gotta go Medina.
[91:24.50]It's Cowboy giving the same fucking advice that I'm giving, but back then.
[91:32.06]We tied it all together.
[91:43.66]What about being the guy who sits at the automatic player piano and pretends to play it because people prefer listening to a real pianist and not a machine?
[91:51.15]But you already bought the automatic piano.
[91:53.21]Yeah, you could be the piano guy.
[91:54.47]I didn't even think about that.
[91:57.18]By the way, that guy always stays alive.
[92:02.98]You need somebody to play the fight scene or the shootout of the saloon.
[92:10.77]In fact, not only does that guy stay alive, a bullet goes through his hat.
[92:15.46]Like, right through the top, and he's like, oh, gee, oh, my.
[92:19.18]He always gets away unscathed.
[92:20.30]That would be a good career path back then.
[92:21.48]Dear me, you truly found Dreamstone.
[92:41.91]I'll lend you a hand.
[92:42.49]Oh yeah, she helps.
[93:19.79]Yeah, there was even a career path back in the day of just being a guy, standing behind the other guy, saying like, Yeah!
[93:26.34]Like, Terry, you like to be the guy that says, Yeah!
[93:44.84]Yeah, just a hype man.
[93:46.38]That guy got thrown after a job?
[93:48.50]That was a big heist.
[93:50.64]Hey, like, Danny here.
[93:53.46]Ding!
[93:54.86]Here's like a gold coin for you.
[93:58.90]Yeah!
[94:00.76]That was like a week's worth of fucking food and shelter.
[94:05.02]I appreciate you.
[94:05.78]You said yeah, and you shot at that other guy when you missed.
[94:09.16]You didn't hit anything.
[94:11.75]But you looked cool doing it.
[94:18.64]Of course, the dream stone must be refined if we are to repair the Masabune.
[94:22.79]That is not all.
[94:23.43]The blade itself must be activated as well.
[94:30.81]I don't think that was a job, but you go, girl.
[94:40.05]Yeah, but you could have, like, made bread.
[94:45.54]You could have baked bread.
[94:46.76]There was the bread maker.
[94:48.72]There was the banker.
[94:49.61]There was the guy that brushed your teeth for you.
[94:53.93]The toothbrusher.
[94:56.17]There was the... Yeah, the guy that, like, he slathered all the shaving cream all over you and was like... We're getting one dialog box every five minutes.
[95:08.26]Alright, alright.
[95:09.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[95:09.58]Let me get back to this.
[95:14.71]You want to be the guy that sells the pans and shovels.
[95:16.93]Yeah, you could be, you could have been a, you could have been a crazy guy that just sat around biting fucking coins.
[95:22.80]Being like, what is that?
[95:23.88]Ooh, is this gold?
[95:25.94]Oh, no, it ain't.
[95:27.42]Oh, shucks.
[95:29.84]Up to your knees in the river.
[95:36.05]You could still do those things.
[95:52.19]I sound drunk.
[95:53.95]Yeah, hold on.
[95:54.83]I promise I'm gonna move on after this.
[95:57.13]Oh, hey, Danny, so let me, so you, let's go over the three things.
[96:01.43]You could be, you could stumble around and be drinking.
[96:04.69]You could stand in knee-deep water screaming yahoo at finding a little small piece of gold or letting horses kick you in the face.
[96:20.59]Or you could travel with my show, and... Somebody said it.
[96:34.17]Chewing tobacco.
[96:36.06]And you could just be the guy that spits chaw out of his mouth.
[96:43.89]You genuinely could get by back in the fucking, like, 1700s as, like, a guy, like, an NPC guy that, like, sits on the front steps and, like, chews and spits.
[96:56.46]I don't know how you were making a living.
[96:58.73]I guess you were.
[96:59.33]Yeah, rocking chair guy.
[97:05.17]Just like, yep, that's me.
[97:08.50]Yeah.
[97:12.28]Welcome.
[97:13.86]I don't work here, but I sure as hell stay here.
[97:21.85]That guy just existed.
[97:22.85]He was there all day.
[97:33.09]Take a look at this bottle.
[97:40.32]The Hawk Tua career.
[97:45.77]Can I be the harmonica guy?
[97:47.21]You could have been a harmonica guy.
[97:48.45]Yeah.
[97:48.91]Oh, have I introduced you to my good friend?
[97:53.27]Harry?
[98:18.96]But you could also be a guy that wandered into a town, ate paste, and died of unknown causes.
[98:23.55]Yeah, you could be the guy that grabbed the wrong berry bush and just fuckin' insta-died.
[98:38.42]And then even have like a funeral for you.
[98:39.92]It's just like, ah, yeah.
[98:42.69]Yeah.
[98:44.27]Michael died.
[98:45.13]Yep.
[98:47.13]Well, he ate the green berries.
[98:49.17]Yeah.
[98:51.01]Yeah.
[98:53.65]What are we having for dinner?
[98:54.49]Alright, it's done.
[98:59.49]Can you bring me the dream stone?
[99:05.94]I'm done here too.
[99:07.36]Here we go.
[99:09.54]The paste got him.
[99:11.40]Yeah, Terry was a good guy, unfortunately.
[99:14.67]That damn paste got him.
[99:17.11]I don't know why anybody's eating the paste anyways.
[99:20.59]It stinks, it smells, it doesn't have a good flavor.
[99:23.72]Why are people eating the paste all the time?
[99:25.72]I don't get it.
[99:28.28]Anyway, Doc, can you take a look at this giant fucking rash off my back?
[99:44.01]that's a loud sound we're gonna have to remove your back yeah whatever it is what it is hey at least I didn't go out eating that paste sorry to keep you waiting damn look at that
[100:17.33]alright I could stay on this for hours because this time period is like one of the most crazy like ridiculous time periods I don't know how did we even get here behold the master bone in all its glory how peculiar my senses are detecting pulses of mental energy emanating from the master moon
[100:45.29]That's a good senior quote right there.
[101:21.28]Would you like to buy something?
[101:23.72]That's a great segue.
[101:33.02]Nerd alert.
[101:34.10]Cringe quote?
[101:35.10]That's not a cringe quote.
[101:36.68]Time that person up for ten minutes.
[101:51.11]Alright, now we gotta go to frog.
[101:55.37]I keep thinking about all that shit we were just talking about.
[102:28.92]You don't put a sword quote in a yearbook.
[102:31.76]Yeah, actually, that's true.
[102:34.26]You don't put a sword quote.
[102:35.86]That's... Okay, well, what would you put there?
[102:43.14]You know, I told you what mine was.
[102:44.36]You guys remember mine?
[102:49.61]You have to remember what it was, right?
[102:57.31]What's the best one to do?
[103:03.33]Isn't there two of them?
[103:04.31]I guess that's the only one.
[103:12.57]Ben Franklin?
[103:13.29]No.
[103:15.29]My senior quote was Yoda.
[103:18.95]and I misquoted him it's what I wrote was do or do not there is no try but the actual quote is do or do not do there is no try
[103:45.70]Don't... L. I'm seeing L's.
[103:47.48]That's a good one.
[103:49.28]Oh, stop.
[103:49.94]That's a... What do you mean, oh, brother?
[103:51.32]It means... You know what that means?
[103:54.96]It means... It means do it or shut up.
[103:58.26]Do or don't... Don't try.
[103:59.70]Do it.
[104:05.76]And then I immediately flunked.
[104:15.93]Yesterday, you said tomorrow.
[104:21.82]Okay, bat-chesting Star Wars in 2025 is fine.
[104:25.70]Bat-chesting Star Wars in 1996 would... No way that was the coolest shit on Earth.
[104:33.03]In like 2005, 2003, Star Wars was fucking cool.
[104:33.93]Okay.
[104:34.13]Okay.
[104:43.93]It was damn cool.
[104:46.03]You can batch test it now.
[104:47.09]Go for it.
[104:54.88]The prequels.
[104:55.76]Yeah, whatever.
[104:56.40]Prequels are fine.
[104:59.98]Hey, prequels were fine.
[105:01.32]Shove it up your ass.
[105:22.96]They're better than fine?
[105:23.92]I thought they were alright.
[105:28.30]I'm in one of those moods tonight, I'm just... Everything is just... Nothing is serious tonight.
[105:36.69]Ah, I'm having a good time, hope you are too.

[106:19.35]You've come again.
[106:19.95]The sword?
[106:25.17]No, it could not be.
[106:26.13]The Masamune?
[106:28.37]I must ponder this turn of events.
[106:37.54]You may remain here for the night.
[106:49.93]Cyrus, you're leaving, aren't you?
[106:51.15]I am.
[106:53.27]It's long past time we reclaimed the badge from the Frog King.
[106:57.64]And I need to see that sword with my own eyes.
[107:03.72]Cyrus, this kingdom has need of you.
[107:08.20]Meen and I need you as well.
[107:09.90]See that you return.
[107:12.78]As long as there is life in these bones, I shall come that I will be back.
[107:19.38]Come what may.
[107:21.40]Well then, by your leave.
[107:33.23]Sir Cyrus!
[107:40.01]On behalf of the... Stop ruining my favorite scene!
[107:44.83]On behalf of the knighthood, we wish you... This is not it.
[107:47.41]This is like top five.
[107:48.35]This is five.
[107:50.01]On behalf of the knighthood, we wish you a safe journey and godspeed.
[107:55.47]My brothers... I trust the kingdom's protection to you.
[108:02.28]See that she is kept safe from her enemies.
[108:10.90]That's a cool sword
[108:39.23]So, you seek the hero's badge, Knight of the Kingdom of Men?
[108:43.81]Come and take it then, if you can.
[108:48.55]That is what I mean to do.
[108:50.83]Nirvana Strike!
[108:54.57]I am beaten.
[108:56.53]Filthy badge.
[108:57.37]Do not think I will forget this.
[109:07.95]Go!
[109:09.82]Glenn, watch out!
[109:12.56]Cyrus, your sword!
[109:13.46]The Masamune!
[109:21.48]Is that the best you can do?
[109:24.39]Without your sword, you're nothing.
[109:25.87]You've not bested me yet.
[109:31.29]Cyrus, I'm done for.
[109:32.63]I'm dying.
[109:35.61]Listen to me, Glenn.
[109:37.03]I'll hold them here.
[109:37.85]Use that chance to escape.
[109:43.81]stay and they'll only kill us both.
[109:45.37]Go, Glenn!
[109:48.45]Hadn't you better worry about yourself, Cyrus?
[109:52.07]I do not think you have the time to be concerned with the well-being of others.
[109:55.45]This is it, Glenn.
[109:58.37]Go!
[110:06.93]Cyrus!
[110:09.63]Run, Glenn.
[110:10.51]Run!
[110:12.22]Queen, take care of Queen Lean, I beg of you.
[110:14.50]I beg you.
[110:19.84]No!
[110:21.29]No!
[110:31.49]What's the matter?
[110:33.31]You're not going to try your luck?
[110:39.06]Like a scared little frog with no pond to jump into.
[110:43.38]How about it, Lord Magus?
[110:44.60]Can't you give him a more fitting form?
[110:48.74]Very well.
[110:50.52]No act of defiance goes unpunished.
[110:54.58]No!
[110:56.46]That's more like it, you spineless wimp.
[111:20.82]Ten long years have passed.
[111:22.02]Have I the strength?
[111:25.24]Oh, Cyrus.
[111:34.44]Awaken, Crono.
[111:41.13]I do not know how far my skills will carry me, but I will put them to the test.
[111:45.93]Let us go to Magus's keep.
[111:49.38]His strength is no small thing.
[111:50.84]Do you understand the odds we face?
[111:56.14]Nothing can beat science.
[112:01.08]We must do it for the future.
[112:05.74]Frog has joined the party.
[112:14.45]Da-da-da-da-da-da...
[112:16.66]Do I bring the, uh, is this, uh, is this Boy's Night?
[112:22.98]This might be a Boy's Night.
[112:35.07]The boys.
[112:35.65]I, uh, no, we got heals.
[112:50.61]He hops around too, it's great.
[113:07.04]I love Frog's crit attack.
[113:12.66]He does a backflip.
[113:14.88]Okay, here's the deal.
[113:19.54]It's currently midnight.
[113:20.58]It's very late.
[113:26.46]I'm thinking I'll do one more break.
[113:31.64]And we go for like another half an hour or so.
[113:34.58]40 minutes.
[113:46.19]Yeah, let's at least go see the cutscene because the cutscene is cool.
[113:55.23]We will assess after the cutscene.
[114:02.85]So I'll be right back.
[114:04.82]This will be the last break in the night for sure.
[114:06.90]I'll be right back.
[114:10.52]Three minutes or so.
[114:16.45]See you guys soon.
[114:36.40]you
[115:49.25]you

[118:03.90]Thank you.
[118:50.92]welcome back yeah let's get to the cutscene and then maybe just explore the dungeon for a little bit definitely want to see the cutscene because there are not very many of them
[119:14.47]Oopsie daisy.
[119:15.19]It's always hard to avoid this last one.
[119:20.60]Come on.
[119:24.28]Almost.
[119:32.83]I love this song.
[119:33.43]It's like one of the best songs in the game.
[119:37.89]And we haven't even heard like a full half or third of the soundtrack.
[119:42.47]The second half of this game soundtrack is a lot of times better than the first.
[119:46.47]I love his pixel art too.
[119:54.94]He looks so cool.
[119:57.90]Frogs are so cool.
[119:59.26]What a cool animal.
[120:09.09]Frog with a cape it's like a superhero that has a big sword.
[120:12.71]Can you really have a cooler character than that?
[120:14.61]I don't know if you can Alright, let's do it I believe it is it's up here and where is it I Think you have to go through the cave I
[120:54.25]Stop that!
[120:54.99]Oh no, it's Cyrus!
[120:58.13]Run!
[121:05.13]Thank you, Cyrus.
[121:09.76]Glenn, there are times when a man must stand and face things that trouble him.
[121:17.19]But it hurts to be hit.
[121:18.45]I cannot hurt another, not even them.
[121:24.82]You're too soft, Glenn.
[121:41.11]Then I've decided to join the knighthood.
[121:44.95]I thought as much.
[121:45.68]It'll be a fine night, I'm sure of it.
[121:50.12]Won't you come with me?
[121:57.71]I cannot.
[122:00.77]But why?
[122:01.49]You're a better sword than I. You always have been.
[122:09.97]I haven't the nerve it takes to be a knight in a real battle to fear would take me.
[122:14.93]No.
[122:17.60]Ribbit.
[122:44.10]the badge the hero's badge the masamune if you please
[123:24.91]My name is Glenn.
[123:26.55]Long have I carried Cyrus' hopes and dreams, and now I bear the Massamune as well.
[123:32.26]Henceforth I claim them as my own.
[123:34.32]I shall slay the fiend, Lord Magus, and restore our honor.
[124:40.00]Yeah.
[125:11.12]It's so cool to see that as actually that just little sequence right there turned into like an anime.
[125:17.85]It's so cool.
[125:25.54]Oh, here we are.
[125:49.49]Oh, I need to go to Specchio.
[125:50.91]That's right.
[125:51.73]Frog needs his magic.
[126:08.95]Slurp.
[126:09.31]I love that move.
[126:30.61]When do you get Isla?
[126:31.89]Isla, I think, is right after this, I think.
[126:35.37]Maybe a little bit longer?
[126:39.92]And ladies and gentlemen, we have just learned our first triple tech.
[126:45.28]Could it be that you wield magic?
[126:48.06]I thought only fiends could employ it now.
[126:51.70]If you travel to the end of time, you may also be able to gain the use of magic.
[126:55.80]Well, thanks for reminding me.
[127:06.60]We should do that.
[127:38.13]Wizard robot.
[127:43.15]Yeah, the victory screen for Frog the big, yeah, I love that.
[127:45.76]Alright, is that or is that not a cool tattoo idea?
[127:56.27]Right?
[127:57.53]Right?
[128:19.42]Would you regret that in five years?
[128:21.70]Well, here's the thing.
[128:24.66]I have loved this game and this franchise since I was 11.
[128:33.15]I'm nearly 40 years old.
[128:37.13]I still think that they're fucking cool.
[128:40.11]I still think that Frog is really cool and fun and interesting.
[128:45.23]It's been that long.
[128:48.56]Yeah, franchise, I know.
[128:50.02]Don't make me sad.
[128:50.72]Hey, I still am holding out hope that the trademark falling off for Chrono Break is... It didn't happen.
[129:04.36]We just don't talk about that.
[129:13.11]Now there's a weird fellow.
[129:14.79]Looks like his power is water.
[129:17.13]And a frog.
[129:18.13]Who would have guessed?
[129:21.39]So facto minimo magico.
[129:27.99]Chrono brake.
[129:28.61]It was actually, wasn't it B-R-A-K-E?
[129:32.56]Like the brakes.
[129:33.78]Like the brake of a car.
[129:34.46]It was like chrono brake.
[129:36.60]Slow.
[129:36.88]Slow.
[129:44.32]You and Vinny could probably do a podcast on this franchise.
[129:50.31]That's literally not true.
[129:51.35]It's what I do.
[129:54.55]Let's try it.
[130:04.34]Compare notes on this game.
[130:15.92]It's been a long time since I played Chrono Cross.
[130:18.34]And they just, they've re-released it recently, didn't they?
[130:24.32]I love the water magic, by the way.
[130:25.82]Yeah.
[130:30.59]That.
[130:30.81]I want to see it one more time.
[130:50.91]Does that for all of his moves that are in that category?
[130:53.69]Oh, let's do X-Strike.
[130:57.00]I want to see it.
[130:59.40]Oh, never mind.
[131:02.70]Just kill me.
[131:04.08]Kill me.
[131:05.40]Kill me.
[131:05.74]I want to see X-Strike.
[131:06.96]Kill me.
[131:26.67]I win.
[131:32.39]We'll x-strike a random enemy.
[131:33.93]Alright, so that's learned.
[131:39.39]Good to go.
[131:44.79]I'm probably going to be ending here very soon.
[131:47.17]I won't be live tomorrow.
[131:49.09]And I don't know if I'm going to be live Saturday either.
[131:56.67]So maybe on either Saturday or Sunday.
[132:13.04]I don't know if Ster and I will have the Dark Souls 3 thing ready by then, but I'll be live at the very least on Sunday.
[132:35.57]Ooh, bubble stream.
[132:36.77]What was it called?
[132:37.35]Sword stream?
[132:39.73]I got some new tech.
[132:51.99]Yeah, Dark Souls 3 seamless co-op mod came out recently for Dark Souls 3.
[132:59.21]And we might try it.
[133:06.96]Okay, let's keep going.
[133:07.78]Another one of these.
[133:09.34]Alright, let's do X-Strike.
[133:26.38]Triple attack.
[133:33.04]Yeah.
[133:33.76]Almost a thousand damage.
[133:42.21]This takes a lot of MP though.
[133:43.79]No, actually not really.
[134:15.71]Imagine doing a thousand damage to... Get back here!
[134:21.05]Get over here!
[134:27.38]The only problem with this party is there's not... I don't really have much AoE besides Robo.
[134:33.86]I have Cyclone.
[134:37.98]Bubble Breath.
[134:40.32]Sword Stream.
[134:42.92]Wait, this might actually be pretty good.
[134:44.76]Is that AoE?
[134:52.56]stop oh my god double breath no it's not aoe oh we're gonna have I'm gonna die stop it
[135:25.30]I need to slurp.
[135:26.16]Good.
[135:26.30]What?
[135:26.56]Oh.
[136:07.04]This should be good, right?
[136:09.12]Thank goodness for Robo.
[136:25.41]Before I really do this, whenever I play this again, remind me to go get a bunch of potions because I don't have very many left.
[136:34.38]Something else, right?
[136:42.86]a message is scrawled in blood beware the jugglers in the fiend lord's keep strike them and they tighten their defense against blows cast spells upon them and they strengthen their defense against magic here it is this is it
[137:30.38]Being Lord's Keep.
[137:42.47]Damn.
[137:50.51]This place is cool.
[138:00.29]quiet.
[138:00.65]Let's play.
[138:20.69]Let's play.
[138:21.23]He
[138:45.65]It's a cool looking sword.
[138:46.33]What do you think this place smells like?
[139:01.80]Damp laundry.
[139:09.45]Lots of hee hees.
[139:10.39]This is our treasure.
[139:12.47]Let's play.
[139:15.47]I can't get it.
[139:19.69]Luca!
[139:23.70]Robo, don't waste your energy.
[139:31.84]Can't talk to the queen.
[139:33.45]Frog, you're safe.
[139:39.01]Mom.
[139:40.39]Crono, so this is where you've been since the fair.
[139:42.29]You had me worried sick.
[139:55.93]Weird.
[139:58.34]Weird stuff going on here.
[140:00.20]That's weird.
[140:03.02]That's weird stuff.
[140:04.32]That's weird.
[140:04.86]That's wild stuff.
[140:06.30]That's weird stuff.
[140:17.53]Aussie.
[140:23.50]Welcome, Glenn, or should I say, Sir Froggy.
[140:26.26]Never expected to see you here.
[140:30.12]Are those your replacements for Cyrus?
[140:32.96]Lord Magus is a tad busy right now.
[140:35.80]You'll have to take up your business with me.
[140:38.56]After you take it up with the Master Swordsman, slash and flee.
[140:43.46]The magician that is, oh, right.
[140:49.78]Deal with Riz, minions, and go for it.
[140:53.78]And all 100... I almost said besties in this keep, of course.
[140:57.70]Stop it.
[141:16.60]Stop it.
[141:19.66]My besties will annihilate you.
[141:29.91]That move is so good.
[141:38.22]It really is.
[141:42.90]You know what?
[141:43.30]Maybe I'll just dump magic tabs into Robo.
[141:47.70]That move is so good.
[142:07.19]Too bad that wasn't a real save point.
[142:15.28]Should I just walk outside?
[142:16.50]I can't.
[142:20.20]Okay.
[142:24.09]Alright, guys.
[142:24.65]Got to see inside the castle.
[142:30.31]We'll pick this back up.
[142:33.77]It is very late.
[142:43.27]Nothing tomorrow.
[142:53.53]Yeah, it's currently over midnight, so let's call it here.
[143:12.45]Yeah, this one I had a great time.
[143:15.45]Across all the games we did today.
[143:21.04]I forget we played breakfast earlier.
[143:22.72]That was fun.
[143:35.15]But yeah, I'll see you guys later.
[143:36.91]Either Saturday or Sunday.
[143:38.39]Most likely Sunday, but could do a Saturday.
[143:41.01]I might just stream this Saturday night.
[143:43.73]We'll see.
[143:52.75]Have a great rest of your night.
[143:53.59]Get some sleep if you stayed up.
[143:56.66]Or good morning if you just woke up.
[144:03.75]See you soon.
[144:05.81]Give your mother a call.
[144:07.57]You know the drill.
[144:09.71]See you guys later.
[144:33.92]Thank you.
