[00:28.72]How you doing?
[00:35.82]Doesn't this guy eat gravel?
[00:38.12]No.
[00:39.26]I don't.
[00:39.54]I don't recommend it either.
[00:41.59]Dude, can you perform circus tricks on stream?
[00:51.11]If you do, I'll cash app you 50 cents.
[00:59.81]You don't have to.
[01:01.51]You don't have to cash app.
[01:05.15]I'm not doing it.
[01:05.75]No, I'm not doing any circus maneuvers.
[01:10.21]But hello.
[01:10.57]Welcome.
[01:11.49]Today is Wednesday.
[01:12.22]Told you at some point midweek.
[01:18.70]Just going to turn it on.
[01:20.80]Wednesday or Thursday is Wednesday.
[01:22.44]Here we are.
[01:24.43]Going to be just chilling out, playing this game that I've had my eye on for a while.
[01:32.48]It's called The Eternal Cylinder.
[01:37.56]It's a game where you have little alien creatures and their planet is being destroyed and you have to save them and help them.
[01:47.15]And it just seemed kind of interesting.
[01:49.89]So I was like, you know what?
[01:50.77]Why not?
[01:51.35]Let's just do it.
[02:01.41]Gonna be kind of in the same energy level as the Plants vs. Zombies stream.
[02:07.80]Just gonna relax, hang out for a little bit, chill.
[02:15.10]I love alien creatures.
[02:22.02]Why do you hate Pizza Tower?
[02:25.56]I don't.
[02:26.82]I don't.
[02:27.52]Put it on the list.
[02:33.82]Is this going to be seven hours?
[02:35.50]No, no.
[02:36.34]I mean, probably just a few hours, three, four.
[02:40.53]I'm just chilling.
[02:41.31]I'm just here to chill.
[02:48.65]Bro, where is Frog Detective?
[02:52.21]Okay, I promise Frog Detective 3 will happen in February.
[02:58.53]If it doesn't happen in February, then you can be very upset with me
[03:09.07]Yep.
[03:10.98]If on March 1st, you have not seen, if I have not streamed Frog Detective 3, then I'm in big trouble.
[03:26.15]Anyways, let's go.
[03:26.81]Don't want to waste too much time.
[03:31.16]I'm very interested in what this game is.
[03:32.60]It could be really crazy.
[03:34.08]It could be... chill.
[03:36.50]Actually, I don't think this is gonna be that chill, chill, because... I mean, we're avoiding the destruction of this species's planet.
[03:46.85]I think.
[03:48.45]I don't think this is like, oh yeah, just like chilling out.
[03:51.49]I don't know.
[03:52.21]It's kind of, it's probably gonna be a little wacky.
[03:57.53]Yeah, the Eternal Cylinder.
[04:00.76]Let's just start.
[04:02.70]Can you hear it well, maybe?
[04:04.27]Once upon a time in the age of the eternal cylinder, there lived a family of little creatures called the trebum.
[04:11.89]Trebum are not the strongest, nor the fastest, and they do not have sharp teeth.
[04:19.54]They would make easy prey for the terrible force that came to their planet.
[04:24.94]But trebum are loyal,
[04:27.19]and resourceful, and very, very stubborn.
[04:31.43]Okay.
[04:32.43]It is with such a trebum that our story begins.
[04:36.62]One clever little creature born into a cruel world who would be instrumental in bringing prosperity to its kind.
[04:44.50]That's me.
[04:49.29]Is this like Spore?
[04:51.21]I don't think so.
[04:53.29]I think... I don't know.
[04:56.15]We'll find out.
[05:09.24]Okay.
[05:11.02]I wonder what happened.
[05:14.26]This is pretty.
[05:15.86]What an unfortunate place for a beginning.
[05:17.92]Okay.
[05:22.46]And now what?
[05:23.14]Run!
[05:23.46]Is this a controller game?
[05:24.32]What is that?
[05:39.00]Oh my God, there's a giant wave behind here.
[05:46.10]I this is a controller game.
[05:47.14]Holy shit, OK.
[06:03.85]Don't stop running.
[06:04.95]I'm not I'm going.
[06:11.94]I can't make this.
[06:12.54]Am I just gonna die?
[06:16.15]Oh shit, can I jump?
[06:23.53]What do I do?
[06:25.27]What do I do?
[06:25.75]What do I do?
[06:26.25]What do I do?
[06:27.23]The great crushing thing, the great cylinder had stopped.
[06:31.58]Perhaps it was safe here for a little while.
[06:33.68]Is this PUBG?
[06:34.82]How quickly it learned to use its legs and its trunk.
[06:39.93]But these things were not so much learned as they were remembered.
[06:44.65]Out of material.
[06:47.17]They were a gift from the strange voice it heard in its mind.
[06:50.69]Are these evil?
[06:51.65]That too was a kind of memory.
[06:56.29]Oh, what did I just do?
[06:57.16]Okay, what did I just... That was weird.
[07:01.72]What did I just do?
[07:02.56]Okay, choose materials you've collected.
[07:05.28]Okay.
[07:08.64]And do what?
[07:11.19]Can I just eat it?
[07:12.77]Just when it was starting to get used to its legs, the food from the jumping creature gave it new ones.
[07:19.98]With the right substance as a catalyst, a trebum can transform and adapt to many challenges.
[07:27.17]Okay, so if I eat, it's kind of like Kirby.
[07:32.01]Shoot anything from your inventory.
[07:33.27]Try shooting water at the flying bugs.
[07:42.60]Okay, so I have water in my nose?
[07:46.96]Okay.
[07:49.80]Can we eat that?
[07:53.10]Should I, like, breathe this in?
[07:58.67]That face is kind of... Oops.
[08:08.21]Okay, I got... Should I eat this?
[08:14.78]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[08:15.32]Come back here.
[08:15.96]Okay, I just shot it out.
[08:17.02]Hold on.
[08:18.44]How do I eat that?
[08:20.62]Okay.
[08:23.41]I cannot eat this.
[08:24.11]Should I suck in more than one?
[08:32.29]I got mushrooms.
[08:41.08]Eat the mushrooms?
[08:45.25]What did that do?
[08:51.59]This might just be healing.
[08:58.38]What is that?
[08:58.74]Okay.
[09:08.64]I can only hold three different types of things.
[09:10.62]Alright, that's good to know.
[09:15.29]This is technically a mushroom, okay.
[09:21.69]How much can I hold?
[09:22.29]Should I store a bunch of this, like a gerbil?
[09:31.91]Ten?
[09:32.17]Ten each, you think?
[09:36.67]Well, do it, come on.
[09:40.85]Suck it up!
[09:43.05]Well, eight's fine.
[09:46.64]The Trebon was drawn to a bright light or perhaps to the creature next to it.
[09:57.20]What creature?
[10:00.62]There is something over there.
[10:01.76]What is that?
[10:02.28]It's like a brontosaurus.
[10:08.19]Except for the grass growing on the old one's head, they were very much alike.
[10:16.18]one surrounded by this light.
[10:19.09]The tribune knew things it had not known before.
[10:23.25]It knew the older tribune had carried this light for a long Oh, that's a different species.
[10:29.15]And it knew that now that responsibility had passed to the next generation.
[10:34.59]Yes, this young tribune had to carry the light to those great towers in the distance.
[10:43.40]It could have stayed here to learn many old things, but the cylinder would not allow it.
[10:49.97]Is it going to start up again?
[10:55.69]Stanley Parable.
[10:57.61]Yeah, what makes that happen?
[10:59.71]Run, the inner voice said, run.
[11:02.71]The towers would not stop the cylinder.
[11:04.67]No, I can suck it up.
[11:06.91]I'm strong.
[11:11.06]Roll to move faster.
[11:17.58]Okay, so I go up to this thing?
[11:26.56]Somebody said I'm legally drinking alcohol right now.
[11:29.82]Alright.
[11:30.54]Okay.
[11:30.88]Is it going to stop?
[11:42.63]Wait, what?
[11:43.31]Didn't it say this thing?
[11:44.31]How do I stop this?
[11:47.94]Wait, I wasn't- I didn't listen.
[11:52.50]You gotta get out of here!
[11:53.62]Get out of here!
[11:54.12]This is like MOUTH MONSTER!
[11:56.20]OH SHIT!
[12:00.14]Nooo, don't!
[12:08.50]Nooo!
[12:10.00]The voice inside the Trebam's memories assured it that while the tower stood, the Trebam would be safe.
[12:17.76]The power of the eternal cylinder was contained for now.
[12:22.24]Okay, so you block it with this stuff.
[12:25.18]I want to get a look at this.
[12:26.03]Is this thing... What are you doing?
[12:28.19]This relative tranquility gave the Trevum a chance to think about its family.
[12:34.85]Trevum are not meant to be alone, so where were the others?
[12:40.67]I wanted to make a friend.
[12:41.72]I wanted to make a friend.
[12:44.06]I didn't know.
[12:45.00]We both just survived that together.
[12:46.44]You'd think that we would have sort of like a Wizard of Oz moment where it's like, hey, we both have the same shit going on.
[12:52.92]I guess not.
[12:55.88]Okay, well, checkpoint.
[12:57.33]Good, thank God.
[13:03.21]The giant mouth is not a friend.
[13:07.25]I didn't know everything was dangerous.
[13:12.58]Okay, here we go.
[13:12.94]This thing is crazy looking.
[13:30.86]You want, should we share food?
[13:31.56]We're gonna find more.
[13:32.00]Okay.
[13:32.10]Should I eat this stuff?
[13:33.58]I feel like there's a lot of random things I can collect.
[13:38.20]Alright, these are like eggs or whatever they are.
[13:41.58]This counts as water?
[13:59.87]Oh, I have like a water meter.
[14:01.19]OK.
[14:07.47]So I gotta find more friends.
[14:10.92]This character looks like you.
[14:13.90]Yeah, maybe a little.
[14:19.73]Okay.
[14:20.01]What do I do?
[14:20.93]Am I gonna break this if I move it?
[14:23.25]This looks like kind of an incubator.
[14:25.37]Oh.
[14:25.55]Put it down?
[14:49.49]Alright, no, okay, this is like the, oh.
[14:53.99]Wugwool.
[14:57.45]Okay, hey, hey, hey, don't just eat stuff.
[15:02.07]Don't just eat stuff.
[15:03.05]I don't, wait, I can't control Wugwool.
[15:07.38]Wugwool just has a mind.
[15:09.06]I like the pattern.
[15:12.14]Okay, so we got two now.
[15:15.78]How do I make it so you have bigger legs?
[15:19.93]Here, eat this like fucking turnip, whatever this is.
[15:22.59]Oh, that's me eating it.
[15:27.10]Here.
[15:28.64]Try one of these.
[15:32.62]Eat that.
[15:35.82]You don't want that?
[15:36.34]Alright, I'll keep it.
[15:40.05]Alright, so we have another party member.
[15:42.03]This is not moving yet, so that's good.
[15:49.88]Anything else to do here?
[15:50.75]What about this stuff?
[15:52.55]Ooh.
[15:56.57]I think it's just food.
[15:57.39]I don't think it... Does it do anything?
[16:02.47]I ate that grasshopper and I got legs.
[16:05.81]I can't really eat anything else.
[16:08.21]Alright, there's a mouth monster over there.
[16:09.32]I'm not going over there.
[16:18.83]I wonder how many little people you end up having.
[16:25.38]Do I have a life cycle?
[16:26.36]Am I just going to die eventually?
[16:30.96]Oh, it's way too cold over here.
[16:32.16]Get out.
[16:35.10]Can we eat something to make us have... I don't know.
[16:36.90]Let's see.
[16:37.16]Come on.
[16:41.14]Mutation items have a lightning bolt next to them.
[16:43.22]Oh, so I'm imagining that's just health.
[16:48.72]Probably just food.
[16:50.04]Health.
[16:54.00]Did I miss something?
[16:56.76]Anything else to do?
[16:57.40]I'm very intrigued by this game.
[17:04.89]Drink some water?
[17:05.51]Actually, yeah.
[17:08.09]It's too cold over there, though.
[17:08.95]What was that?
[17:18.05]Are these animals?
[17:23.24]This is fucking Dr. Seuss shit.
[17:25.94]Ooh!
[17:28.32]Hold on.
[17:36.87]Ooh, what does this do?
[17:39.95]Okay.
[17:49.13]How do I do that?
[17:57.73]That's annoying.
[17:58.75]Should we both eat one?
[17:59.71]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[18:06.76]Let's test it.
[18:18.12]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[18:20.50]It's 4-2 with fart noises.
[18:22.19]I think I just have to explore.
[18:28.63]It's so cold over here, though.
[18:32.83]Shit, no.
[18:33.69]This way.
[18:36.91]You doing the auto voice?
[18:38.01]Yeah, of course I'm doing auto.
[18:45.65]Wait.
[18:47.01]How long can I... Hold on.
[18:48.69]Are these predators?
[18:52.07]No.
[18:53.71]Wait, this is fuzzy.
[18:54.69]Hold on.
[18:55.01]Wait, wait, wait.
[18:55.73]Can we wear these?
[19:00.81]It's going to be like a sweater.
[19:12.56]Did you get one too?
[19:17.42]Now we're fuzzy.
[19:23.02]I feel like this game is dangerous.
[19:24.40]I'm gonna get... Okay.
[19:28.00]Is there... Do you see anything else?
[19:29.37]Hold on, I'm gonna go this way.
[19:32.99]Oh shit, don't die.
[19:33.73]Is there fall damage?
[19:37.75]Weird mushrooms.
[19:41.35]I need water.
[19:41.87]Do you just die if you run out of water?
[19:47.26]You can swap?
[19:48.23]Oh, I can swap.
[19:49.15]Okay, Q swaps.
[19:51.71]Interesting.
[19:52.27]Alright.
[19:52.49]There's an egg over there.
[20:07.88]Can we sneak by this thing?
[20:08.78]Oh god.
[20:09.54]Is it awake?
[20:12.88]Is it awake?
[20:18.31]Get me out of here.
[20:24.58]A new family member.
[20:26.62]Gwee.
[20:26.96]Okay.
[20:30.80]Hi, Gwee.
[20:34.54]Uh... Okay, so we're... Gwee doesn't have any protection from heat, though.
[20:45.61]I mean, cold.
[20:47.01]What the fuck did you just do?
[20:51.62]I think we need fur, right?
[20:55.06]We need, hold on.
[20:55.58]No, no, no.
[20:57.42]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[20:58.40]Are we sharing it?
[21:05.93]I think, yeah, we shared it.
[21:07.95]Why can I not move?
[21:08.71]Okay, I can't move with this creature.
[21:16.74]Why not?
[21:22.11]I can't physically move.
[21:25.07]That's strange.
[21:25.81]Okay.
[21:26.19]Well, whatever.
[21:26.67]I've got three.
[21:33.03]I need water.
[21:33.57]Yeah.
[21:40.48]Come on, come on, come on.
[21:41.74]We have to find a pond or something.
[21:43.32]Wait, there's water here.
[21:45.26]This is frozen water.
[21:46.12]Can we, like, break it?
[21:46.90]Can we drink out of this?
[21:55.74]Come on, there's gotta be something I can drink.
[22:03.44]Get the water eggs.
[22:05.49]Oh, that's a good idea.
[22:07.33]Why can I not control this guy?
[22:13.63]Oh, this is water.
[22:14.29]Okay.
[22:17.61]We're gonna die.
[22:26.33]lake over here.
[22:35.28]Can I just stick my face in here?
[22:37.04]Just drink it?
[22:42.53]Alright, yes.
[22:42.95]We can do this.
[22:43.41]Come drink.
[22:47.45]Make sure you get... Yeah, there we go.
[22:49.71]Fill up.
[22:54.42]I have lost control of this character.
[22:56.94]All I can do is drink.
[22:57.80]Okay.
[23:01.15]Satisfied?
[23:08.69]This thing hasn't started moving.
[23:09.86]Should I swim over there either?
[23:13.38]It's all salt water.
[23:18.16]Where to go?
[23:20.90]It's too young to swim across.
[23:22.46]Watch for the beams of light that come from activated towers.
[23:26.38]They will point you to objectives or areas of interest.
[23:30.08]Ooh.
[23:31.28]It was hard for the Trebom to know what to do or where to go.
[23:36.40]But the friendly voice suggested this was not the right way.
[23:41.20]Streamer mode?
[23:41.84]To find your path, it said, you must follow the beam of light.
[23:46.14]I did not get Luigi'd.
[23:47.80]Of the tower.
[23:49.84]I didn't get... I did not get Luigi'd.
[23:58.98]Wait, everybody should have the little horn, right?
[24:04.00]Where's the horn?
[24:04.46]I just heard it.
[24:07.32]Or maybe not.
[24:07.90]Okay, so we need to go this way.
[24:13.12]Should everybody have a horn?
[24:23.17]Why not?
[24:24.17]Yeah, might as well take one.
[24:32.54]I think this is my favorite.
[24:33.38]I like the blue.
[24:37.06]Okay.
[24:45.51]So everybody has access to that.
[24:46.69]Alright, let's control...
[24:50.99]Uh, you.
[24:53.55]Alright, this thing wants me to go this way.
[24:57.25]We could probably fuck somebody up.
[25:05.07]Not that that's what I want to do.
[25:06.37]I'm just making it clear that... What's that?
[25:14.19]Wait, the snail?
[25:14.81]That was just open.
[25:16.84]What was that?
[25:17.36]Did you see that?
[25:24.38]What does that sound?
[25:30.00]That was a fre- yeah, that's a freaky snail.
[25:36.57]What do we do with this guy?
[25:41.67]I don't know, but I got him!
[25:43.55]Um... I don't know.
[25:47.67]What should we do with him?
[25:50.03]Kill it?
[25:50.71]Why?
[25:51.05]What if it could help us?
[25:58.24]Oops, hang on.
[26:00.12]Wait, that guy just attacked me.
[26:07.69]Get out of here!
[26:14.79]Just jump over.
[26:17.07]Wait!
[26:22.83]He's like a little weirdo.
[26:27.30]Get out of here!
[26:29.59]What the fuck?
[26:36.21]I'll never play this instrument ever again, I promise.
[26:40.93]Holy shit, that was crazy.
[26:42.31]Okay.

[27:34.99]Alright, get the egg.
[27:43.24]How do we get up there?

[27:50.59]I don't know.
[27:55.05]Oh my god, get out of the water, get out of the water.
[27:56.87]I think we're dying.
[27:59.43]We're struggling.
[28:00.41]Get out of the water.
[28:01.21]We're struggling so bad.
[28:04.19]Please don't drown.
[28:05.41]Okay.
[28:05.98]Oh my god.
[28:06.76]That was bad.
[28:09.04]Can I knock the... Wait.
[28:10.72]Come here.
[28:10.94]I have an idea.
[28:16.28]Fuck.
[28:16.54]That was a gridded.
[28:20.22]That wasn't a bad idea.
[28:23.52]Stack them up?
[28:26.15]Can we do that?
[28:29.59]Can I jump on top of one of their heads?
[28:38.13]Maybe it's the fish that has... Wait, the fish... This is part of the fish here.
[28:42.39]This is just food.
[28:46.27]Yeah, it's just food.
[28:51.20]Fuck.
[28:55.24]Wait a minute.
[28:56.48]This is something else.
[28:58.04]Back to the surface, quick.
[29:04.78]What does this do?
[29:14.54]Alright, don't all of you eat that.
[29:16.69]Don't all of you eat that.
[29:18.23]This guy just turned into a cement brick.
[29:21.65]I don't know if that was a good idea.
[29:26.87]Well, I don't know.
[29:37.24]What about the fish?
[29:39.47]Alright, this is an actual fish.
[29:41.69]What do you do?
[29:47.80]Frog?
[29:49.68]Swim more quickly, but can perform a high jump out of the water.
[29:52.04]Alright, cool.
[29:52.62]So we've got float guy, frog guy, and whatever I can do with you, I can't move.
[30:04.26]For some reason, I think it's bugged, but I can't walk along with this character.
[30:07.74]I think it's a bug.
[30:12.44]I wonder, can I tell people to stop?
[30:13.56]Just to stay?
[30:14.62]Or is there like a command?
[30:22.82]Maybe restart it?
[30:23.76]Save and reload?
[30:24.38]Yeah, we'll save it.
[30:27.88]Save and then main menu?
[30:37.17]Look at the tutorial.
[30:39.83]I mean, I just can't move with that one for some reason.
[30:44.44]I don't know why.
[30:50.06]Is he too heavy?
[30:53.36]That's possible, but I don't know.
[30:54.80]I think one of the incubators is over here.
[30:58.10]Who's going to be in this one?
[31:00.84]This game's cute.
[31:01.46]I like it.
[31:01.80]You just kind of get like friends.
[31:06.72]We all have a job.
[31:07.76]Okay.
[31:19.82]Gluon.
[31:20.30]Okay.
[31:22.80]Or... When somebody dies, I'm gonna be really sad.
[31:37.24]Ah, that's way more helpful.
[31:39.70]If I hold Q, I can just select the one I want to control.
[31:44.29]This one's still bugged, but it's alright.
[31:51.25]Alright, well, what do I want this one to eat?
[32:02.26]Reload it.
[32:04.16]Save, and then just load the save.
[32:11.04]Use the broken one as cannon fodder.
[32:13.14]Jesus, dude.
[32:22.40]We have to go over there, and I can tell you I'm not super thrilled about it.
[32:26.48]There we go.
[32:28.13]Okay, I can control this one now.
[32:38.95]Stop sucking up random stuff.
[32:46.21]I was one of them could I feel like this guy I feel this is gonna eat one of us right Who I don't want I'm not getting rid of the big one.
[32:59.20]Oh God alright, so I just get up This door had been built for Trevor I
[33:07.26]It gave them hope that in this large and dangerous world, some places had been made for them.
[33:19.50]Whoa!
[33:20.90]What's that thing?
[33:22.90]What did I just get?
[33:24.94]Some ingredients cannot be eaten until their edible interiors have been exposed.
[33:29.91]There are multiple ways to break open ingredients.
[33:31.83]Try experimenting with throwing them, crushing them, or feeding them to other creatures.
[33:36.66]Items with a breakable exterior are marked with a yellow border.
[33:43.30]Oh my, I feel so bad.
[33:44.32]We just, like, took that snail's... I don't know what we did, but I don't... I'm kind of sad about it.
[33:51.37]Alright, everybody in.
[34:00.39]I broke it?
[34:04.17]I don't know what that is.
[34:05.69]Who should eat this?
[34:06.27]I mean, you've got like the big butt power.
[34:14.70]You've got the swimming power.
[34:17.56]I have jumping power.
[34:18.74]The new guy?
[34:20.64]Here, try this.
[34:29.67]Is it going to snail power?
[34:31.03]What would that even mean?
[34:38.20]Whoa.
[34:39.86]Makes them shiny, sparkly, and very attractive.
[34:45.57]This is like the attractive one.
[34:53.03]Okay, well, cool.
[34:54.32]Let's go.
[35:01.32]I wonder if this is like a little hideout.
[35:11.81]Tap to quickly change the group leader.
[35:14.73]Hold to manually select.
[35:17.45]Don't worry if you lose sight of one of your family members.
[35:19.36]You do not need to wait for other Trebom.
[35:22.16]They will always manage to get where the group leader is.
[35:24.20]Okay, so you don't have to worry about them.
[35:27.72]They will always get to where you're going.
[35:30.00]For better or for worse, I guess.
[35:37.14]Okay.
[35:38.42]It's like... Ooh, what is that?
[35:41.96]To the top right?
[35:44.42]Some kind of resource?
[35:48.84]We should eat.
[35:55.91]Like a... Kind of like... Alien watermelon?
[35:58.23]Alright, everybody eat these.
[35:59.55]I gotta clear up the inventory.
[36:10.92]Sell that one.
[36:11.86]He's rare.
[36:13.90]No.
[36:15.12]This is a family.
[36:18.50]Anybody low on water?
[36:19.26]I think everyone's fine.
[36:22.64]Why do you have so many mushrooms?
[36:26.44]Just eat them.
[36:35.32]Oh my god, I just ate everything.
[36:41.43]Okay, don't all of you do that.
[36:42.93]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[36:47.33]You ate all the food?
[36:48.95]Was that our... Wait, I probably shouldn't have not... I probably shouldn't have done that.
[36:53.47]It's okay.
[36:58.81]Interact?
[37:05.74]Uh-huh.
[37:09.19]So this tells you what everything does.
[37:21.43]Inventory?
[37:23.38]Oh.
[37:25.62]He's got a way bigger inventory.
[37:27.32]Okay, that's cool.
[37:30.06]Alright, you hold all the snacks.
[37:32.10]You're gonna be the snack storage.
[37:36.26]And then the map is here.
[37:40.92]Interesting.
[37:45.00]Very nice.
[37:48.47]It was as if a memory had been stored inside it, waiting for someone to absorb it.
[37:55.63]And as soon as this knowledge had entered their minds, the Trebam realized that there was a great library of information hidden away in the web of their memories.
[38:06.36]But why was the knowledge of a specific ingredient placed here in this trebum made of stone?
[38:13.45]I wonder.
[38:15.01]Oh, more of this.
[38:15.47]Do you collect this dust?
[38:23.76]They're learning.
[38:39.21]We did it!
[38:39.57]Alright, who wants to eat this weird cube?
[39:02.40]Okay.
[39:04.06]So stylish.
[39:05.12]The stylish cube.
[39:09.49]So, yeah.
[39:13.83]I can fit in here.
[39:14.57]Ah, it opens the door.
[39:22.48]Gurumo the Elder.
[39:24.84]I'm going to start talking.
[39:33.85]Wait, this is a, oh, this is an adult.
[39:41.67]This is kind of sad.
[40:04.16]We, Trebom, are inheritors of a vast tree of abilities.
[40:08.60]Abilities passed on to all future Trebom.
[40:12.52]But this power is being taken away.
[40:16.19]Beware the servants of the Cylinder.
[40:18.93]They will seek to hurt you at every opportunity.
[40:22.53]And they have the power to rob you of your abilities.
[40:26.61]But if you persevere...
[40:28.78]One day you will find a way to protect yourselves from their evil light.
[40:34.14]Farewell, my brave friends.
[40:36.38]I fear I am too old and tired to join you.
[40:40.55]May you find a way to prosper in this time of struggles.
[40:44.09]Alright.
[40:48.55]So.
[40:53.56]Thanks for helping.
[40:55.40]Here, have a mushroom on me.
[41:06.27]Okay, so we can go that way.
[41:07.76]Wait, wait, wait.
[41:13.08]He almost shot it up his nose.
[41:17.16]What is this?
[41:17.70]Is this like a bath?
[41:19.75]It's like a little bird bath.
[41:21.73]Everybody, should we get into the, what is it, a jacuzzi?
[41:28.81]Easy.
[41:32.56]Oh, it's a place to fill up water.
[41:35.91]You should make the fat one eat a cube.
[41:40.10]Maybe.
[41:40.40]Is everybody good?
[41:44.92]Everybody have water?
[41:45.58]Make sure to fill up.
[41:48.18]We gotta get out of here.
[41:54.97]Should the fat one eat a cube?
[41:55.99]I don't know if I want another big cube.
[41:59.47]Should I?
[42:04.04]Yes.
[42:05.46]Okay.
[42:18.97]Alright, so he's not, it squished him down.
[42:20.89]He's not big anymore.
[42:22.91]He's just a cube.
[42:28.27]So the power is, some of them don't stack, so now I just have two cubes.
[42:34.85]I lost my, I had a bunch of watermelons.
[42:38.66]Turn him back.
[42:39.64]I can't turn him back.
[42:40.68]He's like this permanently.
[42:42.24]Anybody else want to be a cube?
[42:49.09]No, we have two cubes.
[42:50.35]That's good enough.
[42:56.99]Make him eat something?
[43:00.29]You can't be double cube, right?
[43:01.33]Yeah, I just need to find another one of those fishes.
[43:06.79]That's fine.
[43:07.27]Alright, let's keep going.
[43:19.18]Load the save.
[43:20.74]No, we have to experiment.
[43:26.81]Give them nicknames?
[43:27.87]I don't want to because I know for a fact that some of them are gonna die.
[43:31.03]Like, I just know it.
[43:32.25]You know it, I know it.
[43:33.09]It was not easy to leave the cave.
[43:35.69]But the elder had urged them to go forward.
[43:39.48]Suddenly, they felt the weight of their many tasks.
[43:43.54]To find their Trebam siblings.
[43:46.24]Can they roll?
[43:46.90]They... They can... Yeah, they can still roll.
[43:48.72]You okay?
[43:49.94]How do we rescue this one?
[43:50.84]Food?
[43:51.74]Here.
[43:51.84]Eat this?
[43:52.20]Can you eat that?
[43:53.48]What about water?
[44:27.72]It didn't work.
[44:31.66]What?
[44:32.10]I'm trying... Grunk?
[44:34.72]What is this?
[44:38.93]What?
[44:39.29]I need four?
[44:41.93]Oh, okay.
[44:42.39]We have to feed him four of the... Alright, alright, alright.
[44:45.61]We have to save this guy.
[44:46.97]All that little stardust...
[44:54.54]Fuck, I just wasted so much water.
[44:56.06]Okay, do I still have the indicator telling me where to go?
[45:03.07]Let's get water first.
[45:07.63]Did anything happen at night?
[45:31.56]Oh, fuck.
[45:32.20]Don't come in here.
[45:37.16]I need the jumper.
[45:38.66]Come here.
[45:45.63]It did say, don't worry, they will find a way to you.
[45:47.81]I'm looking for more of that stardust.
[45:52.35]The cave had more dust?
[45:54.01]Oh, is that a murder?
[45:55.15]No.
[46:02.15]Checking to see.
[46:02.81]What's this?
[46:05.11]Weird mushrooms.
[46:05.69]I don't want them.
[46:07.85]Whoa.
[46:10.23]What the fuck is this?
[46:11.03]These are different.
[46:14.09]These are like different eggs.
[46:17.39]This is bad.
[46:19.07]Should I hatch this?
[46:29.76]We're going to take more than one.
[46:31.40]Here.
[46:35.28]Somebody grab that one.
[46:40.10]Grab that one.
[46:40.96]Alright, alright, alright.
[46:43.24]Where's an incubator?
[46:51.14]Break one?
[46:53.20]No, I don't want to do that.
[46:56.57]Incubator.
[47:01.21]Get the stardust, bro.
[47:02.81]Hold on.
[47:08.49]Is there no incubator around here?
[47:09.85]There's one over there.
[47:11.05]Bro.
[47:21.30]What is this stuff for?
[47:29.02]Exiting the blue energy dome that radiates from the tower you activated will awaken the eternal cylinder.
[47:34.70]Warning, not all towers have the same radius of protection.
[47:37.80]Some may be weaker.
[47:41.87]Oh, when I walk... Hello?
[47:45.91]Hello?
[47:46.27]Hello?
[47:46.73]Hello?
[47:46.97]Get out of there!
[47:47.37]No, no, no, no!
[47:47.85]Run, run, run!
[47:48.69]Is this their egg?
[47:49.19]Is this yours?
[47:51.61]You can have it back!
[47:52.09]Take it back!
[47:52.41]You can have it back!
[47:52.83]You can have it back!
[47:53.51]Take it back!
[47:53.81]Take it back!
[47:54.27]Run!
[48:01.78]I think that was- was that their egg?
[48:04.69]I don't know.
[48:05.13]Just run!
[48:05.57]Just get away, get away, get away.
[48:06.43]I don't know where to go.
[48:07.05]I don't know where to go.
[48:07.57]I'm fucking freaking out.
[48:08.57]Alright.
[48:08.85]Where's the egg?
[48:11.75]Where'd it go?
[48:12.05]Give it to me.
[48:12.37]I'm taking it.
[48:13.15]I don't care.
[48:15.31]Whoa, what?
[48:21.08]Oh, shit.
[48:21.48]Okay.
[48:21.60]The cylinder resumed its destruction.
[48:24.86]Nothing could stop it forever.
[48:28.59]Yeah?
[48:30.27]Alright.
[48:31.15]Crap.
[48:31.55]Alright, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[48:41.00]What?
[48:41.14]I don't know what this is, but I want it.
[48:43.20]It's like a weird magical... Okay, go.
[48:49.73]This one right here.
[48:55.63]No, the friend, I forgot.
[48:57.83]I forgot about that.
[48:59.15]Oh no.
[48:59.67]Oh, that's not good.
[49:03.09]That's too bad.
[49:05.25]That's too bad.
[49:06.15]Poor Grungo, whatever his name was.
[49:14.68]You murdered him.
[49:15.62]Keep going, come on.
[49:18.72]Oh my god, go, go, go, go, go!
[49:26.95]Reload?
[49:28.83]No, it's okay.
[49:30.01]I made the mistake.
[49:30.73]I'm gonna live with it.
[49:34.77]Oh, that's sad.
[49:35.79]It's okay.
[49:42.75]Please reload.
[49:43.59]I can't.
[49:44.79]I made the mistake.
[49:45.59]I have to live with it.
[49:55.96]The Trebom found themselves almost as lost as they had been in the beginning.
[50:01.14]And where is the fifth?
[50:02.26]The most powerful of all the Treboms.
[50:05.10]It was only natural to be confused, it said.
[50:09.29]They had been born into a strange, broken world, cut off from the history of their ancestors.
[50:16.41]Everyone was a little lost these days.
[50:19.47]What mattered was to keep going.
[50:21.70]To keep looking for answers.
[50:23.96]To keep carrying the light they held within them.
[50:28.36]The light that stopped the cylinder.
[50:30.64]Why is this one almost dead?
[50:35.60]Okay.
[50:36.58]That would have been sad.
[50:37.38]Pick up water.
[50:44.28]Because I can't find any.
[51:01.25]You're kind of not understanding the fart dynamic.
[51:06.39]Sorry about that.
[51:07.06]Okay.
[51:14.56]Let's continue.
[51:17.49]That looks like poisonous.
[51:18.97]I don't think I want to go in there.
[51:20.19]There's this over here.
[51:32.79]I'm gonna go in this.
[51:33.43]Okay.
[51:46.30]What's this?
[51:49.03]We're all making it out alive.
[51:50.09]In a strange, eerie temple, the Trebom felt something Ster in their memories.
[51:58.05]There was a great power in this place.
[52:01.46]Something from the days when even the elders were young.
[52:05.36]Perhaps it could help them.
[52:11.79]Oh, Ster is here?
[52:13.61]What's up, dude?
[52:16.85]Alright, this is a power.
[52:18.17]Who should have this?
[52:21.09]I think I'm giving it to you.
[52:22.03]Eat that.
[52:29.28]I don't know what this is going to do.
[52:30.46]Hopefully it doesn't do anything weird.
[52:40.13]Okay, so he attracts the flies.
[52:44.99]He has this cool hair now.
[52:48.59]This attracts these flies.
[52:52.16]Wait, what am I looking at her?
[52:53.02]What is this?
[52:54.88]This is a human.
[52:57.58]This is a human.
[53:00.47]Wait.
[53:01.83]No, wait.
[53:02.39]What the fuck is that?
[53:04.04]What is this?
[53:07.22]It's like a human in a human.
[53:12.74]Alright.
[53:13.26]Well, what do I do here?
[53:18.65]Get those.
[53:25.27]I think I have to bring them over here.
[53:28.89]Yeah.
[53:29.31]Wait, what's this?
[53:29.81]I don't know.
[53:32.69]What does this do?
[53:33.09]I don't know.
[53:34.90]They're like little crystals.
[53:35.78]I'm taking them.
[53:41.22]Humans have mutations too.
[53:50.83]That was very ominous.
[53:51.81]Okay.
[53:52.89]So...
[54:00.32]I think I just have to bring flies over here.
[54:04.30]So follow me?
[54:05.02]Alright, here they come.
[54:17.11]Okay.
[54:19.99]Now can somebody take that?
[54:21.11]Alright, who has a room?
[54:22.09]You.
[54:28.44]Oh no, maybe not.
[54:29.10]Oh, wait!
[54:35.15]Could not retrieve any helpful information from the Trebum memory cluster.
[54:40.71]Whoa.
[54:41.91]Okay.
[54:46.30]So was that giving me... The Trebum were disoriented for a moment.
[54:49.66]It was like a finished map.
[54:50.44]Something new had entered their memories and they needed to make sense of it.
[54:55.19]It seemed to be a map.
[54:58.99]And on this map, a location had been marked.
[55:03.05]If they understood correctly, there was some manner of serpent, a guardian, a greater being of some kind somehow linked to a safe haven.
[55:14.30]Could they find refuge there?
[55:16.92]Their ancestors must have created this map for a reason.
[55:21.32]Alright, so we have to go find the big giant serpent thing.
[55:25.28]So hold on, let me.
[55:28.20]How do I get to this menu?
[55:29.70]Can I press a certain button to get there?
[55:32.60]How do I get to that menu?
[55:33.34]Is it M?
[55:41.85]Escape?
[55:47.29]How do I do that?
[55:50.76]Press the map key.
[55:51.68]Hold on, let me... Roll, spit.
[55:55.80]Open inventory.
[55:56.92]Interact.
[55:59.87]Eye?
[55:59.99]Eye?
[56:02.85]I think it's I. Yes, okay.
[56:06.45]So, a map, it's marked on, it's now marked, which is up here.
[56:09.90]So we gotta go out here, through here, to here.
[56:13.16]Okay.
[56:15.80]Good luck.
[56:20.06]So this gives you a map fragment piece.
[56:24.43]Wait, hold on, what's that?
[56:28.87]You see that up here?
[56:35.98]I wonder if I can eat that.
[56:41.55]Can I grab that?
[56:42.15]Ooh, thank God.
[56:49.36]Tapioca pudding, yay or nay?
[56:52.06]Uh, tapioca pudding is probably... It's probably a nay for me.
[56:58.96]I don't hate it, but I'm not... I wouldn't order it.
[57:01.72]I know that a lot of... Some of what... Boba, right?
[57:05.46]Is tapioca.
[57:07.60]That's alright.
[57:08.03]Ooh.
[57:11.99]What?
[57:15.87]Where did that just go?
[57:16.49]Oh, okay.
[57:19.05]A little ball?
[57:22.47]Somebody pick this up.
[57:28.53]I gotta break it.
[57:36.25]Oh shit.
[57:37.15]What is- okay.
[57:39.41]We have two cubes.
[57:40.78]One of the cubes is not gonna be a cube anymore.
[57:45.80]Should we give it to the attractive one?
[57:49.12]Or the- I don't know.
[57:54.80]Give it a blue?
[57:58.14]Alright, the attractive cube or the blue... Okay, well, we'll give it a blue.
[58:10.43]So much bullshit.
[58:11.41]Just fucking get rid of these stupid mushrooms.
[58:17.34]Come here.
[58:19.70]No, get this out of here.
[58:21.34]Stop eating.
[58:22.16]Get rid of that.
[58:23.86]Okay.
[58:27.00]Let's see what happens.
[58:34.13]Plated body?
[58:34.97]Okay, so I gotta shell.
[58:43.04]This one's a fight.
[58:44.22]This one can fight now?
[58:45.96]Turtle?
[58:46.24]Alright, let's fill up.
[58:55.27]And we gotta get out of here.
[58:56.19]I kinda wanna see if I can get that.
[58:59.81]You know what I mean?
[59:03.05]Can I break this shit?
[59:06.12]I feel like I can use this for some reason.
[59:08.61]These little crystal things.
[59:09.43]I feel like I can get that.
[59:17.93]Shoot water at it?
[59:23.67]Oh!
[59:24.19]It worked!
[59:25.40]It actually worked!
[59:26.20]Alright, what is this thing?
[59:27.28]I don't know who's gonna eat this.
[59:34.82]Dude, what is this?
[59:35.86]I don't know what this is going to do.
[59:37.05]Should I hold it?
[59:37.59]I'm going to hold on to this.
[59:48.69]Yeah, I'm going to hold this.
[59:50.53]We have turtle, we have fish, we have jumping spiky haired dude, and we have attractive cube.
[59:57.41]I think this is good for now.
[60:00.97]I think this is okay.
[60:06.57]Let's keep going.
[60:15.61]Would you play Project Zone Void?
[60:17.99]I think so.
[60:25.03]What manner of strange beast lurked behind the cylinder?
[60:29.37]The Trebom were deeply unsettled by this new mystery.
[60:34.06]But though some part of them was curious,
[60:37.01]They were certain it would be best not to find out.
[60:41.23]Where is everybody?
[60:43.63]Yeah, get me out of there.
[60:44.39]Did the narrator just cough?
[60:50.24]They should not find out.
[60:51.54]There's an incubator here.
[61:03.96]I wish I had one of them.
[61:05.72]Hold on.
[61:10.39]What is this?
[61:12.39]This is just food.
[61:13.59]I don't want to go yet.
[61:14.51]Holy shit.
[61:19.91]What's that?
[61:20.33]Oh my god.
[61:20.95]Alright.
[61:21.63]There's too many things.
[61:23.21]Just eat it.
[61:23.53]A water processor?
[61:32.16]The water processor mutation is constantly processing ingredients found in its inventory slots, transforming them into water.
[61:41.07]Note that this does not extract any nutrients from them.
[61:44.38]Be mindful of what you absorb with this trebum, as its body will automatically process any organic ingredients stored inside.
[61:51.94]The Trebom were excited by this discovery.
[61:55.06]This new mutation would allow them to extract water from ingredients that were otherwise quite dry.
[62:02.19]Don't do that.
[62:02.95]But the voice cautioned them to be careful.
[62:06.25]More water was useful, but this process would not extract any nutrients.
[62:12.81]They would have to use it carefully and wisely.
[62:17.25]Uh.
[62:19.13]Somebody just turned into a water filter.
[62:20.81]Alright, so let's go with this.
[62:25.03]I mean, maybe the thing that's 10?
[62:28.47]Right?
[62:32.00]Maybe this too?
[62:32.66]Okay.
[62:41.50]This is just going to be producing water.
[62:46.59]You put dry things in it.
[62:49.20]And it just makes... Okay, so this thing just needs to suck up a bunch of junk, right?
[62:53.30]Alright, let's keep going.
[63:03.89]Oh god, okay.
[63:07.65]We need another egg.
[63:12.97]You gave him too many items?
[63:14.13]I did.
[63:18.15]Oh shit, I see what you mean.
[63:24.65]Only give stuff to this character when we need water.
[63:27.29]Was that mean?
[63:40.34]Alright, we need to look for an egg.
[63:54.24]Looking for eggs.
[63:56.54]That's interesting, whatever that is.
[63:58.08]I want to go look at it.
[64:04.71]Does it show where we are on the map?
[64:07.73]It does.
[64:08.13]Alright, we need to go up here.
[64:11.81]Let me investigate this.
[64:23.27]Alright, go, go, go, go.
[64:24.67]Do not aggro that thing.
[64:28.29]I want this weird building over here.
[64:30.70]This thing.
[64:33.22]There's this.
[64:33.86]There's this building.
[64:34.78]Whatever this weird, like, big piece of artwork it looks like.
[64:37.04]Alright, what is this?
[64:39.96]Oh, fuck.
[64:40.54]Everybody's cold.
[64:43.18]We still don't have that mutation?
[64:44.94]I thought we had it.
[64:45.48]Alright, I won't be here long.
[64:59.97]What is in here?
[65:04.09]Nothing in here.
[65:05.65]It's like a cool thing.
[65:09.47]There's got to be something over here.
[65:17.62]Whoa, no, no, no.
[65:18.14]Don't just pick stuff up.
[65:18.82]You're going to turn it into water.
[65:20.30]Actually, that's okay.
[65:20.74]Alright, we got to get out of here.
[65:29.28]What's this?
[65:32.35]I don't know what this does.
[65:32.91]I don't know what this is.
[65:34.27]Somebody take this.
[65:35.69]We gotta get out of the cold now.
[65:37.55]Get out of the cold, out of the cold.
[65:38.41]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[65:39.41]How do I get out of the cold?
[65:42.29]We gotta go this way.
[65:42.89]Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[65:53.98]Come on, get out, out, out, out, out, out.
[65:55.10]We're okay.
[65:58.36]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[66:03.77]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[66:13.53]Don't die, please.
[66:15.53]Oh, wait, the thing's moving, the thing's moving, it's moving, it's moving.
[66:17.56]Go, go, go, go, go.
[66:25.44]Eat this?
[66:33.13]What happened?
[66:34.94]Oh shit, that... Whoa!
[66:36.48]No!
[66:37.92]It's okay, no!
[66:38.48]No, no, no, it's a... Back it up, back up, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[66:43.22]This way, this way, this way.
[66:44.99]No, that's awful.
[66:46.97]No, we're all gonna die.
[66:48.93]We're all gonna die.
[66:50.17]Follow me, follow me, please.
[66:53.37]Go!
[66:54.29]Oh, I fucked up everything.
[66:55.93]I fucked everything up.
[66:57.67]I ruined everything.
[66:59.33]It's okay, it's okay.
[67:00.76]It's alright.
[67:01.82]We're gonna get over here.
[67:03.87]We gotta get this way.
[67:05.91]Through here, we're safe.
[67:13.09]Okay.
[67:14.94]Come on!
[67:17.68]Oh, goodness.
[67:18.86]Okay, so, that was a little bit of a problem.
[67:22.64]That was a little bit of a problem.
[67:24.16]I have to activate it?
[67:26.94]Oh, shit!
[67:28.46]The tires had fallen and the light was lost.
[67:33.15]There was no more point in running.
[67:34.83]Yes, there is!
[67:35.65]Yes, there is.
[67:36.11]This cylinder would consume everything.
[67:38.71]I thought it was gonna stop it.
[67:40.01]I thought it was gonna block it.
[67:42.05]I thought it was gonna block it.
[67:43.00]I thought it was gonna block it.
[67:44.26]Is there no more of those things?
[67:54.64]Oh my god.
[67:56.59]Okay.
[68:00.14]I didn't know I had to activate it.
[68:01.58]That was terrible.
[68:02.64]I feel so bad.
[68:03.78]Okay.
[68:06.48]Uh, well, did the auto save?
[68:09.03]This was two minutes ago?
[68:15.03]Okay.
[68:15.93]We're good.
[68:19.11]We need to just go this way.
[68:20.73]I had it right.
[68:22.74]Just get out of here.
[68:26.66]I do want to eat, though.
[68:31.11]I want to eat this.
[68:32.65]Because this thing makes water.
[68:34.13]What the fuck did you just do?
[68:35.40]Okay, we're good.
[68:38.78]So now this thing processes more water.
[68:42.04]So it's better.
[68:44.74]Here we go.
[68:45.10]Okay.
[68:45.78]Everyone sit out here for a sec.
[68:47.57]I'm not going to activate it yet.
[68:55.01]Please get away from us.
[68:59.53]Is there an egg here?
[69:03.56]Egg?
[69:03.78]Egg?
[69:04.04]Wait, people say an egg.
[69:04.94]Is there an egg?
[69:06.88]Wait, is there an egg?
[69:09.27]I don't see one.
[69:27.35]Oh my god.
[69:28.29]Everything is so dangerous.
[69:31.71]Is it a big peach egg?
[69:33.81]No.
[69:35.47]Guys, that's a mouth monster.
[69:36.73]See?
[69:47.26]We're good.
[69:57.04]What about this thing?
[70:00.62]Do you do anything?
[70:02.76]Can we do anything with this?
[70:04.26]Or is it just a set piece?
[70:15.93]You left an egg.
[70:16.51]I don't think I did.
[70:24.91]I got plenty of time.
[70:36.69]I don't see anything.
[70:40.59]Usually they'd be like a little.
[70:41.63]Oh no, look at the distance.
[70:43.27]Gonna make it.
[70:51.92]You're gonna make it.
[70:55.90]Oh, they're not gonna make it.
[71:03.83]Alright.
[71:11.38]What's wrong?
[71:15.82]Oh, wait.
[71:16.48]You're hungry.
[71:17.44]Does anybody have food?
[71:21.34]Okay.
[71:22.34]The stomach meter represents your party's food and energy level.
[71:25.33]It's divided into two parts.
[71:27.89]Stomach and the energy pouch.
[71:30.17]Stomach holds all the food you consume and fills up depending on the nutritional qualities of the ingredients you eat.
[71:34.07]You can digest food when resting or standing still.
[71:38.57]Which depletes the stomach and fills the energy pouch.
[71:42.34]Energy punch is not only necessary for your Trebum to survive, it's essential for replenishing the energy the Trebum used to roll.
[71:48.42]The less energy you have, the more slowly your stamina and endurance will regenerate.
[71:52.13]Okay.
[71:55.05]Rolling consumes a lot of energy, so if you plan on rolling to distant safe areas, you must be prepared.
[72:00.01]As their fear faded, the Trebum started feeling weak and tired.
[72:06.52]With all the excitement and adventure, they'd neglected their most basic needs.
[72:12.34]The sound of an empty stomach reminded them that survival requires more than escaping from danger.
[72:20.12]You also have to eat.
[72:22.68]Luckily, one of the many gifts of the Trevum is the capacity to store food in their bodies.
[72:29.05]But they still need to digest it to gain the vital energy that gives them strength.
[72:34.24]And for such small creatures, they do require rather a lot of food.
[72:40.28]Fortunately, the Savannah was rich in flora and fauna, which would satisfy their little bellies without necessarily triggering a mutation.
[72:51.15]So I think you share it, it looks like.
[72:53.47]Because when I eat, it goes plus, plus, plus.
[72:55.43]I think it's for everybody.
[72:56.87]Alright, so they're introducing mechanics as we go.
[73:03.79]That's interesting, whatever that is.
[73:07.67]Alright.
[73:08.43]I'm fairly safe right now.
[73:14.67]Looking for eggs.
[73:22.98]This game's really cool.
[73:23.98]I like it.
[73:30.75]So I'm imagining you probably can get anti-poison protection or something.
[73:46.73]You should use that thing you already have.
[73:49.17]Um, who has the, the turtle has it.
[73:55.33]I think I'm going to feed this to the attractive cube.
[74:13.61]Third eye.
[74:14.41]You can use this mutation to look for specific ingredients by tagging them in the compendium.
[74:22.47]Okay.
[74:23.89]Of all the changes that Trebum were experiencing, growing a third eye was the strangest one yet.
[74:30.86]Okay.
[74:32.28]To make things even stranger, this eye seemed to look in two directions at once.
[74:38.34]into the world and into their memories.
[74:41.46]Click the eye icon next to an ingredient.
[74:42.58]They could use it to find in the real world any element that was contained in the web of their memories.
[74:50.88]It was truly a remarkable mutation.
[74:54.30]What should I look for?
[74:56.86]Where's the thing to make the big puffy one?
[75:04.97]One of these.
[75:05.55]Here.
[75:05.69]Should I look for this?
[75:09.50]OK.
[75:10.86]If I do that then.
[75:14.14]How do I know where it is?
[75:15.14]I wonder.
[75:23.04]Looks kind of funny.
[75:25.71]Can you do eggs?
[75:26.69]Can you look for eggs?
[75:28.53]That's a good point.
[75:34.37]Egg yolk.
[75:37.80]Um, egg shroom.
[75:40.80]I don't think I can look for them individually.
[75:50.48]All hail attractive cube.
[75:52.90]Seer of the unseen.
[75:54.36]There's a creature tab.
[76:04.85]Uh,
[76:08.79]Hey, well, it's okay.
[76:11.07]Alright, we need to find an egg.
[76:11.89]I need to find a fifth party member.
[76:13.13]Mm-hmm.
[76:24.26]Go.
[76:24.60]Alright.
[76:28.01]New friend.
[76:28.41]I need an incubator.
[76:40.81]I don't see... Wait, is that one over here?
[76:48.44]Ow.
[76:52.06]Sacrifice the rest of them.
[76:53.12]You only need one.
[76:55.41]I highly doubt that.
[77:05.12]Here we go.
[77:05.90]What?
[77:06.02]We're good.
[77:08.70]Once I get more than five or six of these, I feel like I'm going to start losing track.
[77:12.22]Alright, what do we get?
[77:12.90]Come on out, friend.
[77:20.93]Gru Temu.
[77:24.75]Hello, Gru Temu.
[77:26.89]What are we going to turn you into?
[77:33.82]We'll figure that out.
[77:34.72]Alright, we need to eat.
[77:35.92]Who has food?
[77:38.28]You do.
[77:39.08]Eat a few mushrooms.
[77:52.89]What about his mouth?
[77:54.37]What?
[77:56.97]What?
[77:57.07]Okay, we got a new friend.
[77:57.85]The goal is ultimately to go...
[78:02.83]this way yeah we gotta go up here there is another uh place there but I'm not gonna do that yet hold on I feel like there might be something else wait nah a lot of danger over here though
[78:34.76]What is that thing?
[78:36.18]Oh, that's weird.
[78:40.86]Oh, the thing pukes?
[78:43.36]What is that doing?
[78:44.22]Oh my goodness.
[78:47.77]Everybody be careful.
[78:52.25]What is this thing?
[78:55.15]What the fuck?
[79:01.18]Alright, so what is this?
[79:07.08]Bro, that thing is disgusting.
[79:13.18]Wait, new fruits.
[79:16.20]Ooh, wait.
[79:17.17]Okay.
[79:18.61]Let's do it.
[79:19.05]Allows the trimmer to produce a song that causes the Glick Ball to follow them.
[79:37.78]Yeah.
[79:47.13]What happens if I eat more than one?
[79:50.65]Nothing.
[79:50.93]Okay.
[79:52.13]Alright.
[79:53.91]Cool.
[79:55.23]What is a Glick Bowl? ...
[80:07.47]Can I go any deeper?
[80:08.61]Is that it?
[80:11.69]No, that's it.
[80:16.57]What's that?
[80:22.84]Oh my god.
[80:26.24]What else do I need to do with this?
[80:35.89]Can I activate this, or what's this here for?
[80:38.15]I wonder why is this activated.
[80:43.41]Cube hole?
[80:45.77]Ah, that's right.
[80:46.53]Okay.
[80:46.85]The thing's going to get out of the way.
[80:51.62]Is the big guy a Glick Bowl?
[80:54.32]Possibly, but I don't really want to find out.
[81:05.58]Alright, get the attractive cube in there.
[81:16.76]Nice.
[81:20.96]The Trebam felt a great power flowing through this cave, but they were not afraid.
[81:28.40]The power felt familiar, even friendly.
[81:33.36]These glowing structures were the work of their ancestors.
[81:38.98]Puzzle.
[81:41.82]I need water.
[81:42.20]I need food, too.
[81:45.47]Okay.
[81:47.01]Well, we're going to suck up all this shit.
[81:49.69]Should I turn him on?
[81:59.47]Water storage?
[82:00.55]Increase your maximum water storage capacity.
[82:05.11]These are upgrades.
[82:10.54]Cool, OK.
[82:15.70]They all cost six.
[82:16.62]Should I do this?
[82:25.21]I wonder if I should hold on to this to get another friend.
[82:37.72]Maximum health is 2.
[82:52.46]Can the attractive cube evolve into the larger, more attractive cube?
[82:56.85]Maybe?
[83:02.13]I don't know.
[83:02.49]We'll find out soon enough.
[83:13.33]Alright, so I have seven.
[83:14.15]I think that's all there is here.
[83:18.25]What's this one?
[83:24.30]Oh, the maximum number of trebom.
[83:28.82]How many can we have now?
[83:37.39]OK, like we need that.
[83:44.00]That's maximum can have more family members.
[83:50.44]Didn't click on one.
[83:54.80]Increase the size of the stamina wheel.
[83:56.28]Probably health.
[84:00.90]I want to blow through on my on my material though.
[84:05.96]You do it twice.
[84:11.80]Twice or save it?
[84:17.74]Just once?
[84:18.12]I'm happy with that.
[84:20.17]Alright.
[84:22.65]I wonder if I lose access to this place.
[84:25.03]Isn't this going to get destroyed?
[84:26.19]This thing's about to get annihilated.
[84:35.35]Water?
[84:35.75]Yeah.
[84:44.72]Alright, we're good with water.
[84:46.28]How are we on food?
[84:47.18]Who has food?
[84:47.72]Dude, none of you have anything.
[85:00.45]Save the game?
[85:01.13]Yeah.
[85:02.00]I think it actually is saving right now.
[85:08.14]Where's my fifth?
[85:19.27]These crystals too.
[85:20.29]Alright, there's food, there's water, and then there are crystals.
[85:25.39]What the fuck are these for?
[85:27.75]Right?
[85:28.29]Like, what is this for?
[85:29.30]There's gotta be something to do with this.
[85:32.20]Let's see.
[85:38.58]Is it even in the compendium?
[85:54.56]Memory cluster contains a fragment of a story about a culture hero called Naka who was cast into the underworld.
[86:02.06]This is, is this it?
[86:10.27]Yeah.
[86:14.13]Okay.
[86:15.97]So does this really do anything?
[86:20.53]Food creatures.
[86:21.89]It's a memory cluster.
[86:28.07]I think it's just there for fun.
[86:30.89]Put it in the water?
[86:31.53]I mean, they're cool looking, but I don't think they do anything.
[86:41.49]I think we're good.
[86:50.95]Eat one?
[86:53.17]I'm not sure you can.
[86:54.03]That's right.
[86:54.39]You cannot eat one.
[87:03.33]Let's go.
[87:05.61]You're probably going to need 30 of those in the last five minutes of the story.
[87:09.19]True.
[87:12.31]What's the objective of the game?
[87:13.49]The objective of this game is you are these little creatures and there is an eternal death wall that is slowly destroying everything.
[87:22.45]And you need to outrun it and live.
[87:26.47]Alright, we're good.
[87:33.39]What's that?
[87:38.76]What the fuck is that?
[87:40.40]Alright, I'm getting nervous.
[87:41.20]I gotta get out of here.
[87:41.74]Alright.
[87:49.48]I got an egg.
[87:50.06]Let me check over here.
[87:51.34]How we doing on food?
[88:00.29]We're alright.
[88:08.74]Pretty good.
[88:13.02]Just checking.
[88:16.71]Just suck up a bunch of bullshit and make sure to eat it.
[88:18.55]That's the play.
[88:24.31]There we are.
[88:24.67]Alright.
[88:26.19]The objective is over here.
[88:30.41]Over here.
[88:31.53]Straight ahead.
[88:35.51]I got plenty of water, plenty of food.
[88:38.23]Let's go.
[88:40.53]That cube is so attractive.
[88:45.64]Speedrun the game.
[88:47.10]Speedrun the game is... I'm sure there's a rolling speed mutation.
[88:51.76]You probably just run as... Oh, yup.
[88:57.61]A new friend.
[89:04.83]I don't activate it yet.
[89:12.25]Yeah, I'm sure this... I don't like that thing at all.
[89:19.82]There's two of them too.
[89:22.36]That incubator was over here, right?
[89:27.26]This way somewhere.
[89:34.86]You can't roll.
[89:39.93]Where was it?
[89:52.03]Where?
[89:52.34]I think it wasn't this far.
[90:01.66]Was it this far?
[90:07.65]It was definitely this far.
[90:17.41]Hmm, where is it?
[90:21.67]You have a map.
[90:22.75]Are those on the map?
[90:25.32]Is it right there?
[90:25.90]Is that?
[90:29.02]Is that one?
[90:30.06]Is that what that is on the map?
[90:34.58]Go to the bruhs.
[90:37.51]Bruh?
[90:41.29]What do you mean, go to the bruh?
[90:50.27]Listen.
[90:53.41]What is that?
[90:53.97]Alright, there's something... Alright, alright, I'm getting overwhelmed.
[90:58.47]Hold on.
[90:59.89]We need to open this.
[91:02.21]And then I'm going in that hole.
[91:03.15]Alright, there it is.
[91:12.55]Go this way, go this way, go this way, go this way, go this way.
[91:22.79]The monsters are fucking weird in this game.
[91:25.33]He's exactly in the area I need to be in.
[91:34.12]Get out of here.
[91:38.52]Okay.
[91:47.55]Gunu!
[91:47.97]Okay, Gunu.
[91:52.29]Let's go.
[91:53.11]What, do we have six?
[91:55.19]I'm going in this hole.
[91:56.07]Alright, the hole is over here.
[92:05.54]Hope this does not kill us.
[92:07.38]That'd be very sad.
[92:17.70]You guys ready?
[92:22.96]Whoa.
[92:24.00]Don't wait for others when entering or exiting small caves.
[92:26.58]Jump pads and moving platforms.
[92:27.64]They move on their own and will follow you.
[92:31.04]I want to look at this though.
[92:32.06]There's like something up here.
[92:37.35]Can I touch that or something?
[92:44.17]Okay, so this is a jump pad.
[92:51.85]Are you alright?
[92:57.41]Woogwool.
[92:59.13]Need more leadership.
[93:02.91]We're perfectly fine.
[93:07.47]What do you mean need more leadership?
[93:19.56]What does that mean?
[93:20.94]We're not smart enough?
[93:25.43]Need more leadership.
[93:29.07]What?
[93:33.65]Ooh, something new.
[93:36.48]New shit in here.
[93:41.44]Uh, you.
[93:42.64]Open that.
[93:47.04]This is... Alright, this is just health.
[93:49.94]Nothing else in there.
[93:57.44]The upgrade thing?
[93:58.36]Party full need upgrade.
[94:05.04]Oh.
[94:08.60]No.
[94:09.41]They're going to die down here.
[94:15.79]What do we do about this?
[94:25.61]Will you be able to jump higher and have the turtle shell?
[94:28.68]Curious.
[94:34.84]Yep.
[94:37.16]Okay.
[94:42.63]I think this is the leader.
[94:43.35]You need to kill them.
[94:48.93]I don't think so.
[94:52.40]I feel so bad.
[94:53.11]I really want this one.
[94:55.15]How much was it?
[94:56.53]I'm going to buy it.
[94:56.99]I'm buying it.
[95:00.09]I don't care if it's a waste.
[95:02.25]I want this friend.
[95:02.83]Oops.
[95:19.98]This is kind of hard to get out of here.
[95:32.07]Okay.
[95:34.21]I'm rescuing that one.
[95:42.12]Oh, I won't have enough.
[95:44.36]That's right.
[95:45.38]It's going to be like four to upgrade.
[95:48.70]And then it's probably going to be four or five to get him.
[95:51.59]It's four.
[95:52.73]Will I have enough to free him?
[95:57.27]That's the question.
[96:02.08]You have six.
[96:06.94]I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do it.
[96:12.68]I think I just have to move on.
[96:21.65]Is game music on?
[96:22.97]Yeah, it should be.
[96:23.45]Is that better?
[96:28.33]Maybe it was just too low.
[96:33.80]You should just try.
[96:35.02]Alright.
[96:35.38]What if I waste all my stardust and whatever the hell this stuff is?
[96:38.39]Alright.
[96:40.39]Uh, fine.
[96:53.05]We'll do it.
[96:57.46]Why is this closed?
[97:02.18]It's locked off now?
[97:07.28]We can't go back in.
[97:11.16]Unfortunate.
[97:13.18]There's a hole in the ground?
[97:18.41]Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[97:21.53]No, I don't think I can get back in.
[97:25.01]Go in the hole you jumped out of.
[97:28.87]Um... What?
[97:35.85]The hole I jumped out of is where the... It was just a little cave with that pink guy.
[97:41.81]Upgrade rooms are locked when you exit.
[97:44.59]Oh, it's too bad.
[97:46.93]That's too bad.
[97:47.55]I'm sorry.
[97:48.15]And I mean, are we willing to sacrifice somebody?
[97:50.79]I don't know if I'm willing to sacrifice anybody.
[97:55.27]Should we sacrifice the new green guy?
[98:01.19]But we just got Gunu.
[98:03.85]Gunu doesn't deserve to die.
[98:10.68]Kill Gunu.
[98:12.08]What?
[98:13.10]I can't believe I'm hearing this.
[98:15.42]Kill Gunu?
[98:19.60]No, we can't even get... I'm not going to kill this sexy cube.
[98:26.86]Are you out of your mind?
[98:29.10]Alright.
[98:30.84]I'm making a decision here.
[98:37.33]I'm sorry.
[98:38.07]No.
[98:40.14]No.
[98:40.84]Gunu stays.
[98:42.95]I'm sorry.
[98:44.57]Pink.
[98:45.97]Pink.
[98:47.43]Trevum.
[98:47.95]I'm sorry.
[98:49.31]I've made my decision.
[98:50.11]Alright.
[98:53.49]We're going to go this way.
[98:54.69]Left.
[98:56.27]Over here.
[99:00.24]We need water.
[99:02.08]I'm going to eat and have water.
[99:03.66]Where's the water guy?
[99:05.34]You.
[99:06.20]Turn this into water.
[99:06.90]Yep.
[99:08.46]Yep.
[99:11.87]Okay.
[99:14.29]What else you got?
[99:15.89]You have like power shit.
[99:18.13]Eat that.
[99:22.01]Eat that.
[99:26.10]Uh, eat that.
[99:31.00]That was a lot of water.
[99:31.90]Holy shit.
[99:32.40]Okay.
[99:36.54]Turn that poop into wine.
[99:42.24]Alright, I think we're good.
[99:45.36]Goal is over here.
[99:46.08]I'm going to take the turtle.
[99:52.31]I'm going to take... Big raid coming in from Conrad's pants.
[100:02.37]What's up, Conrad?
[100:04.41]Welcome, everybody.
[100:05.20]Thanks for the raid.
[100:09.25]We're currently playing the Eternal Cylinder.
[100:12.33]It's pretty fun.
[100:13.07]Hope you had a good stream.
[100:16.99]Just chilling out for a little bit.
[100:18.11]Playing it.
[100:18.91]And I need to just get a... We gotta go now.
[100:21.33]We gotta go now.
[100:22.73]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[100:23.47]Do not get picked up.
[100:25.52]Okay.
[100:25.94]We're moving.
[100:27.26]And we're not looking at anything.
[100:29.54]I'm not gonna look at how scary that is.
[100:30.68]In that I'm just crossing the path right now.
[100:33.68]Get away from Puke.
[100:36.06]Everything is okay.
[100:38.66]Here comes the wall.
[100:41.38]Everyone's chasing us.
[100:43.98]Okay.
[100:48.06]Everybody's still intact.
[100:49.08]Yep.
[100:49.18]We're going to be really hungry after this.
[101:01.45]Get out of there.
[101:02.93]Get out of there.
[101:04.79]I got you.
[101:05.15]Don't worry.
[101:10.76]oh what do I do it is a car it's a car is it gonna wake up I don't want to be here to find out don't wake up was this strange being half flesh half metal the trebum felt an old distant horror as if they remembered their own destruction
[101:40.16]Something about this creature was very, very wrong.
[101:45.19]So don't wake it up.
[101:46.05]The hand behind the car.
[101:51.17]That is weird.
[101:54.35]I don't think we want to wake this.
[101:57.17]I'm not going to.
[101:57.91]Oh, it's the influence of the Three Fingers.
[102:06.89]Perhaps the creature would wake up with a loud noise.
[102:09.76]Did we want that to happen?
[102:11.80]I don't really want to do that.
[102:13.36]I need, wait, what is this?
[102:17.20]There's a hole behind it.
[102:21.74]But just let me, what is this?
[102:26.28]Pull the plug here?
[102:26.98]Can we pick this up or something?
[102:44.06]I don't know.
[102:46.62]Need to eat something?
[102:47.93]Yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[102:59.03]But anyways, thanks to the right corner.
[103:00.27]Hope you're doing good.
[103:03.38]Yeah, we're just chilling out.
[103:05.58]Just hanging out.
[103:09.22]Who told you to do that?
[103:10.99]Who did that?
[103:12.83]Who told you to do that?
[103:13.65]It's awake now.
[103:14.33]We need to eat first.
[103:15.37]What are you thinking?
[103:17.45]Why would you blow the horn?
[103:18.57]Who did that?
[103:21.93]Trapped on all sides by deep pools of poisonous gas, the Trebom needed to find a way to escape this monstrosity.
[103:29.80]I didn't want that to happen.
[103:31.00]Perhaps there was a way to use the creature's own weight to lower the bridge?
[103:36.30]okay first of all so you need to run over here and and smash into this it was gunu he betrayed you what's wrong with us what what's wrong with us what's wrong what's happening what's wrong with us
[103:59.31]No!
[104:00.63]I can't look behind me.
[104:02.95]Restart, restart, restart, restart.
[104:04.31]Everyone's gonna fucking die down here.
[104:06.04]Restart, restart.
[104:06.90]No!
[104:07.48]Everyone's like coughing and choking.
[104:09.56]How do we get out?
[104:10.06]How do we get out of here?
[104:10.66]How do we get out of here?
[104:21.65]What the fuck?
[104:22.57]It's so hard.
[104:27.50]God dam- Gunu, god damn it.
[104:29.76]Gunu, we were not ready.
[104:31.46]Gunu, we weren't ready.
[104:35.25]You just wiped out the entire fucking family, Gunu.
[104:47.63]You blew the- Why would you blow the horn?
[104:49.29]I wasn't prepared.
[104:50.59]Okay.
[104:58.75]Ban Gunu from the guild.
[105:02.88]Alright, so the idea is we have to wake up the mon- wait.
[105:06.80]Not yet.
[105:07.14]Let me eat first.
[105:14.19]Do not blow your horn.
[105:15.97]Just wait.
[105:30.95]Get out of here.
[105:42.60]Just trying to get full stomach.
[105:43.72]Alright, I want the water.
[105:48.28]I want you to produce water.
[105:49.92]Pick up a bunch of junk.
[105:57.59]OK.
[106:00.34]Gunu, fight back.
[106:01.36]Wait.
[106:04.90]It wasn't Gunu.
[106:06.92]Gunu doesn't have a horn.
[106:09.72]It was Vu.
[106:12.19]It was this dumbass.
[106:15.09]Okay.
[106:15.61]Well, whatever.
[106:17.47]So the strategy here is we're going to wake up this thing and have it run over here.
[106:23.20]That's, I guess, what I'm going to do.
[106:25.48]Let's try it.
[106:41.26]Won't wake up from this?
[106:42.60]Why not?
[106:43.42]Oh, go go go go.
[106:54.23]Trapped on all sides by deep pools of poisonous gas, the Trebom needed to find a way to escape this monstrosity.
[107:01.75]Oh, here.
[107:02.63]Perhaps there was a way to use the creature's own weight to lower the bridge?
[107:08.83]Oh, fuck!
[107:09.41]Alright, we got it.
[107:09.99]We got it.
[107:10.25]Go, go, go, go, go.
[107:14.57]One by one.
[107:16.23]The yellow light cruelly burned away the Trebom's ability.
[107:20.31]Stop!
[107:20.89]How do I stop this?
[107:21.99]The elder had warned them about the evil light of the cylinder's servants.
[107:26.15]The light.
[107:26.95]Now they knew what kind of creature to avoid.
[107:29.99]Get out of the poison.
[107:33.95]Are we all- did we make it safely?
[107:35.15]One, two, three, four.
[107:39.59]Are you guys alright?
[107:43.41]Alright, take a break.
[107:44.89]Hold on, we need to take a break.
[107:49.27]So we don't have any more abilities.
[107:52.65]We don't have an attractive cube anymore.
[107:54.39]Okay.
[107:59.17]So now we kind of start the process up again.
[108:01.72]Alright.
[108:05.70]Ruined the run.
[108:07.56]No sexy cube.
[108:08.90]Attractive cube.
[108:11.96]Alright.
[108:12.30]Alright.
[108:14.48]How we doing?
[108:15.20]We need.
[108:15.70]Up here.
[108:18.24]But there's still space to explore over here, so let's go ahead and just see what we have.
[108:23.10]That weird car is no longer over here.
[108:35.79]Just scanning the field.
[108:37.97]See what's here.
[108:46.23]I wonder if you can eventually kill those things.
[108:48.19]Or fight back or attack or something.
[108:53.37]Interesting.
[108:55.97]What's that?
[108:58.55]Behind you.
[109:00.82]We're good.
[109:01.10]I mean, yeah, there's that thing, but... We're getting out of here.
[109:12.22]What is this?
[109:15.86]Revival Shrine.
[109:16.88]These special runes scattered around the world allow you to store or revive fellow trebum.
[109:23.68]Storing trebum can be useful if you reach the maximum party limit but would like to call upon some of your trebum during a later stage of the adventure.
[109:31.03]Reviving lost trebum comes at a cost.
[109:34.32]The cost is based on how many mutations the trebum had when it perished.
[109:38.94]Okay.
[109:41.26]When the Trebom stepped on the strange device, an ancient memory came back to them.
[109:48.55]A memory of long ago, where the cities of their people still stood,
[109:53.46]and a fight against the Cylinder was not yet lost.
[109:58.04]In those days, a very smart Trebom had found a way of cheating the Cylinder, of stealing a little bit of its power to absorb and to reshape.
[110:08.75]In this way, the Trebom could revive their fallen friends, or send others to a hidden place.
[110:16.39]And it was also by this device that a link had been forged.
[110:21.41]They have so many G names?
[110:22.33]And a path had been opened to the voice that spoke within them.
[110:26.21]Gwe, Gwewen, Grutemu, Gunu, Wugwo.
[110:33.03]Put Gunu in the hole.
[110:37.37]Should we?
[110:37.81]Alright, Gunu is in the cloud.
[110:48.02]But that's kind of unfair.
[110:50.34]No, we don't want to store Gunu.
[110:51.80]Everyone's safe.
[111:03.00]I think the whole point of storing is if they have a certain mutation that you don't want to lose.
[111:08.80]But nobody has a mutation.
[111:10.40]We all got it all just kind of ripped away.
[111:23.12]That's cool.
[111:23.56]That's how that works.
[111:24.14]Alright.
[111:25.23]Does that have a thing?
[111:26.11]Does it look like anything on the map?
[111:27.71]Like that.
[111:29.49]Well.
[111:32.11]Not much further.
[111:33.19]To get to whatever that is.
[111:34.81]I wonder if there's anything else.
[111:43.40]Store someone away and save the pink one.
[111:46.32]I really hate to say this.
[111:48.56]The pink one is gone.
[111:50.21]Pink one is over there.
[111:52.13]Far over there.
[111:52.91]Buried dead.
[111:58.89]Get some water.
[112:02.12]Oh, hold on.
[112:03.64]Wasn't somebody supposed to be finding the fish ones?
[112:05.60]Here we go.
[112:05.94]Alright, who do we want to be the big fat one?
[112:14.82]Blue?
[112:17.28]I'm not... It's just storage, I think.
[112:20.11]Make Gunu the fat one.
[112:22.75]Why?
[112:23.05]It was blue before.
[112:29.04]Fine, we'll do... Okay, Gunu, here you go.
[112:36.86]Alright, Gunu.
[112:46.72]Now, Gunu is everybody's favorite character.
[112:54.15]All these, like, omega lols.
[112:56.11]LOL.
[112:57.25]LOL.
[112:57.67]Ha ha ha ha.
[112:59.49]That's so stupid.
[113:02.75]It's not like that.
[113:03.41]It's not even like that funny.
[113:04.67]It's just like... He's just a little bigger.
[113:08.66]It's not like... He's a blobfish now.
[113:10.90]Alright.
[113:13.86]Oh, speaking of... Oh, we're not generating water anymore.
[113:17.28]Okay, well... Let's eat.
[113:27.23]I think I'm ready to move.
[113:37.81]Yeah, I think so.
[113:38.42]Unless this is a hole over here.
[113:45.93]I think it's time to move.
[113:47.53]Huge poison chasm over here, so I need to go this way.
[113:50.32]That dude's built like a Hershey Kiss.
[113:55.28]Yeah, I see it.
[113:58.18]Alright, I'm going for it.
[114:01.09]Alright, prepare.
[114:08.93]I need to go there.
[114:14.24]Are we ready?
[114:14.62]Alright, everyone's had food, everyone's had water.
[114:17.59]Go!
[114:41.23]This one's moving a little faster.
[114:47.29]Nothing here?
[114:47.93]Good.
[114:48.35]Alright.
[114:49.05]Go.
[114:49.23]Catch your breath.
[115:17.81]Oh, fuck, it's actually kind of close.
[115:19.66]Go, hurry up.
[115:23.88]Oh, is it alright?
[115:25.10]Get in, get in, get in, all of you.
[115:27.02]Oh, thank goodness, okay.
[115:30.34]Jesus.
[115:36.54]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[115:41.36]What happened?
[115:42.71]What happened?
[115:43.13]What happened?
[115:43.84]What happened?
[115:44.34]Why did that happen?
[115:45.42]Why is it still going?
[115:46.08]The cylinder roared with fury.
[115:49.32]The voice in their memories spoke with great urgency.
[115:52.82]The Trebom had to be very careful now.
[115:55.94]Oh, God.
[115:56.76]The cylinder would lash out at the land, but it would not let them run too far.
[116:02.70]To survive, they would have to stay in the eye of the storm.
[116:07.53]Huh?
[116:09.41]Where is that?
[116:17.59]Stay in the... What does that mean?
[116:18.86]What's that?
[116:19.12]I don't know.
[116:19.46]I don't understand what that's supposed to mean.
[116:31.90]Stay close?
[116:33.36]It turns out it's producing an electrical barrier that you cannot pass out running lightning strikes.
[116:35.95]It's not possible.
[116:37.91]What do we do?
[116:40.59]You can't get far ahead of it.
[116:42.15]Wait, what?
[116:42.47]We need to eat something.
[116:51.02]Do I have to stay close?
[116:55.54]You have to be between the lightning and the cylinder.
[116:59.87]Oh my goodness.
[117:02.75]Alright, eat quick, quick, quick.
[117:03.87]Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[117:04.83]Go, go, go.
[117:13.99]Not that close?
[117:20.14]There's so much.
[117:21.38]God.
[117:27.67]Alright, it's alright.
[117:28.73]Any more food?
[117:37.21]Ooh, there's that thing.
[117:37.99]What is that?
[117:39.93]Let's find out.
[118:07.02]Plenty of water.
[118:07.64]Everything's okay.
[118:16.61]What is this?
[118:17.07]Can I do anything with this?
[118:17.99]I don't think so.
[118:20.18]I'm just checking.
[118:38.19]This is so scary.
[118:39.53]They're not going to eat us, right?
[118:41.05]Not right now.
[118:41.79]That would be really, really annoying.
[118:46.13]Sacrifice Gunu and run to the cylinder.
[118:48.17]I wonder if this counts.
[118:52.14]Is this going to shatter?
[119:07.54]What did we just eat?
[119:09.60]Lightning is striking me.
[119:15.85]Gunu must survive.
[119:17.41]Back up, back up.
[119:21.53]Don't go too far.
[119:22.21]I want one of these flowers so bad.
[119:32.54]Ugh.
[119:46.00]As frightening and surprising as this enormous creature was, the Trebom felt a sense of relief to see it descend from the sky.
[119:56.60]What the?
[119:57.34]Holy shit.
[119:57.96]This was a celestial being they'd been told to seek.
[120:01.70]Perhaps it held an answer to their troubles.
[120:06.81]Oh, poison.
[120:07.45]Okay, I should give everybody one of these then.
[120:09.73]Yeah, let's all take these.
[120:13.71]Here.
[120:15.19]Everybody grab one.
[120:31.77]Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[120:32.53]Trying to give you this.
[120:33.57]I have to imagine everybody should have it.
[120:54.72]Hopefully it doesn't overwrite what Guna has already.
[120:57.65]So how many people still need it?
[121:06.01]We have one, two, three.
[121:07.11]I ain't fucking around anymore.
[121:20.58]Elv?
[121:21.84]As they approach the colossal creature...
[121:24.51]Their optimism faded.
[121:26.57]Why?
[121:26.81]It did not seem to like them at all.
[121:29.95]What?
[121:30.57]And now they realized what terrible danger they were in.
[121:34.97]If this creature guarded the way to some holy place, then that place must lie below it.
[121:41.06]And being so large, the creature most likely could not see what was in front of it.
[121:45.72]It just killed that motherfucker.
[121:46.96]Alright, hold on.
[121:47.90]So perhaps the size of the trebom was an advantage after all.
[121:52.78]Perhaps they could reach the platform right under the serpent's head.
[121:58.40]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[122:00.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[122:01.59]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[122:06.21]The Trawhala has an electric attack that strikes if you remain in its line of sight for too long.
[122:10.93]Okay, you have to be in cover.
[122:12.53]Alright, everybody has to have the poison on.
[122:16.31]It's just the way it works.
[122:17.76]Come here, Gunu.
[122:19.32]Come here, Gunu.
[122:23.95]Get out of line of sight.
[122:25.19]Who's in line of sight right now?
[122:26.15]Stop.
[122:32.52]Stop.
[122:39.46]Get over here.
[122:41.48]We need food.
[122:42.02]I'm not going over there until we have food.
[122:43.04]Everybody have poison gas mask on?
[122:48.39]You don't.
[122:50.37]Grutemu.
[122:50.83]Okay, Grutemu.
[122:53.01]Grutemu.
[123:07.78]Okay.
[123:09.42]There is an egg.
[123:10.40]Alright, we don't want that to happen to us.
[123:15.20]That was awful.
[123:16.46]So don't... Alright.
[123:18.69]Uh... Shit.
[123:24.77]There's an egg over here, but I don't... Rotom?
[123:28.97]Need more leadership.
[123:32.45]Fuck.
[123:32.67]Okay.
[123:32.79]Okay.
[123:36.08]Move, move, move, move, move, move, move.
[123:37.52]Out of the way, out of the way, out of the way, out of the way, out of the way.
[123:40.52]Let it get zapped.
[123:41.10]Okay, good.
[123:48.20]Um... Gunu, I want you to take point here.
[123:53.07]Everybody has to follow Gunu.
[123:55.73]We need food.
[123:56.49]We need to eat.
[123:56.95]Alright, follow me.
[124:00.51]What happened?
[124:03.21]Fuck.
[124:03.57]Okay, hold on.
[124:08.09]This is something.
[124:09.01]What is this?
[124:11.99]Who wants it?
[124:14.65]One, two, three, four, five.
[124:16.97]Alright, you eat this.
[124:23.60]We need to figure out what this is.
[124:26.30]Electricity... Something about like... I don't know.
[124:29.35]Eat it.
[124:37.85]Legless.
[124:46.01]Well, this one dies.
[124:49.30]No!
[124:51.40]It's okay.
[124:52.48]It's alright.
[124:53.42]We will always remember you.
[124:55.88]We will always remember all the jokes you told us.
[125:00.13]We'll always remember you.
[125:03.83]It's been real.
[125:06.13]You're super nice and we all love you.
[125:09.59]And... Did I make it?
[125:14.39]One, two, three.
[125:15.27]Where are they?
[125:18.22]Where are they?
[125:22.45]One, two, three, four, five, wait.
[125:31.17]It grew back?
[125:36.27]No, we're all here.
[125:37.17]Wait, it was you.
[125:38.79]Is it a, maybe it's a temporary thing.
[125:43.47]What are you doing?
[125:46.09]Ah!
[125:46.97]Why is it targeting him?
[125:51.00]Alright, everybody relax.
[125:52.39]I need to have a game.
[125:53.07]Why is it targeting him?
[125:56.11]We need to eat now.
[125:58.29]Alright, you go get it.
[125:59.43]You're the one that's being targeted for no reason.
[126:02.21]You gotta collect the food.
[126:16.59]Who knew?
[126:17.17]Go for it.
[126:35.80]okay oh we need water now where the hell are we gonna get water
[126:49.90]Everybody can... Alright, we gotta go.
[126:51.60]We have to go for it.
[126:52.60]Hide in the poison.
[126:57.14]We can't get whoever's in that egg.
[126:58.44]It's just not possible.
[126:59.28]It's not gonna happen.
[127:02.09]Let's go down.
[127:05.47]Everybody should be safe down here.
[127:06.49]Okay.
[127:17.33]Okay.
[127:25.44]We need water bad.
[127:26.30]Can we go in this?
[127:40.23]What?
[127:40.37]What does that mean?
[128:06.76]Where's the egg?
[128:11.34]I have a full party.
[128:12.12]You ate the egg?
[128:16.40]Well, yeah, I mean, I have a full party, though.
[128:25.98]I have six Trevums.
[128:28.00]One, two, three, four, five.
[128:29.26]So, yeah, I can't get any more.
[128:30.50]Even if I got that egg and hatched it, I couldn't... You're not going to die from that, right?
[128:35.92]Okay.
[128:40.98]What is that?
[128:46.74]What just happened?
[128:47.40]I'm going down.
[128:55.31]The magic crystals.
[128:59.49]Interesting.
[129:00.03]Ooh.
[129:03.65]Interesting.
[129:04.45]What does this do?
[129:07.39]You try it.
[129:20.54]light oh you turn him into a torch okay that's funny I think we should only have one person do that I don't think we should have more than one yeah starlight
[129:52.66]Mushrooms?
[129:53.82]We're pretty good on food.
[130:06.11]I love this area.
[130:08.19]It's very, uh... What does it remind me of?
[130:11.09]Almost like Fraggle Rock.
[130:20.03]This was... What was this one again?
[130:24.24]Oh, don't, yeah, don't take this.
[130:25.48]This is the, you just, like, lose, this is, like, you don't have legs, right?
[130:30.68]Yeah, I don't want that.
[130:32.94]Drink.
[130:35.02]Everybody got full water?
[130:44.60]Look at this one.
[130:45.80]We need more spots.
[130:50.21]Alright, who's gonna get drowned?
[130:58.50]Save him.
[130:59.06]I can't.
[130:59.52]I have a full party.
[131:01.01]What do you mean?
[131:03.43]What the fuck?
[131:03.87]What the fuck?
[131:04.47]What?
[131:10.99]You need to put them in storage?
[131:12.19]Alright.
[131:15.63]We are going to put the lamp... We're going to put the lamp into storage.
[131:21.37]Because we're not going to need the lamp anymore.
[131:24.27]Rutemu the lamp.
[131:29.14]And anytime we need a light, we will pull Grootimo out of storage.
[131:34.51]That's definitely what you're supposed to be doing.
[131:46.89]Wait, there's a lamp.
[131:49.15]We need to... Okay, you're going to be the front.
[132:00.57]Okay.
[132:06.17]Anything else?
[132:09.74]Ooh, look up there.
[132:11.40]Can I make the jump?
[132:13.20]When you have legs?
[132:14.30]You have legs!
[132:16.50]You ate that weird shit.
[132:20.84]Chest up here, too.
[132:27.58]You have to have the specific... Oh, this is huge, actually.
[132:33.48]Gunu is useless.
[132:34.42]Gunu is a backpack.
[132:36.60]They're definitely not useless.
[132:42.90]Alright, what's in here?
[132:46.88]That looks... Whatever it is, it looks delicious.
[132:51.88]Gunu!
[132:56.64]There you are.
[132:57.80]Over here, please.
[132:58.91]I got a few things for you to store.
[133:07.68]This, I think, is a full heal.
[133:08.78]Can you just open the inventory?
[133:15.80]That's true.
[133:19.77]So this is a full heal, full water, full food.
[133:24.85]Why did you... What is this?
[133:28.89]Should Gunu eat the light?
[133:30.45]I wonder, will it take over his bigness?
[133:34.21]Or will he just be... Will he just glow in the dark?
[133:37.49]I feel like this one should be the lamp.
[133:43.23]The biggest character.
[133:58.28]Okay, I actually like I'm not that happy about this because... Gunu now is going to look like this until he doesn't.
[134:11.02]Well, we got what we wanted.
[134:12.00]Let's go.
[134:17.30]Even with the light, the maze was difficult to traverse.
[134:22.19]Was there some clue in the structures on the walls?
[134:26.75]Was the path of sand on the ground meant to help them?
[134:30.91]Perhaps others had walked in this place long ago and tried to leave a path for those who would one day follow them.
[134:39.03]This is an arrow, right?
[134:41.27]I mean, these are arrows.
[134:42.95]They put arrows.
[134:45.21]They're very smart.
[134:46.07]Something here.
[134:57.37]I want more people to be able to jump.
[135:02.91]Okay.
[135:04.74]Let's get out of here.
[135:07.12]How are we doing on food?
[135:08.60]Good?
[135:09.00]Yeah.
[135:14.57]Wait.
[135:18.17]How do we get out of here?
[135:21.95]Wait.
[135:22.75]This is where we came in?
[135:26.53]It was like, oh, traverse.
[135:28.07]Make sure you know the correct way.
[135:30.37]All the large arrows on the... Wait, didn't I do that?
[135:33.32]Oh, I didn't?
[135:34.44]How did I follow them the wrong way?
[135:36.02]This looks correct.
[135:51.07]Wait.
[135:51.27]Something I can do?
[135:54.27]No.
[135:58.08]Follow the large arrows.
[136:04.91]Interesting.
[136:08.87]This is a snail.
[136:12.75]What significance do the snails have?
[136:20.58]These are big, chunky rocks.
[136:22.06]Can I break them?
[136:29.44]No, I can't.
[136:30.22]Alright, so that's interesting.
[136:31.68]What's with the slug?
[136:41.59]We don't have a cube.
[136:43.27]Unfortunately.
[136:43.81]Maybe we'll get a cube in a minute here.
[137:02.08]Get out of here.
[137:09.78]This is our territory.
[137:11.06]Did somebody kill him?
[137:24.60]Well, it definitely wants us to have a jump power.
[137:26.90]I have a couple people that already have it.
[137:34.29]uh I guess I'll give it to more of you you should probably have it dude it's so dark come on where is it oh it's over here alright eat this get some legs
[138:08.65]Can I give the legs to Gunu?
[138:12.31]I feel like it's going to overwrite.
[138:13.31]It's probably going to overwrite the bigness.
[138:26.01]I think it's legs, not body.
[138:28.18]Hmm.
[138:38.21]Save and try it.
[138:42.40]Well, it's worth a shot.
[138:43.60]Let's see if it is just like legs.
[138:44.78]Maybe it doesn't replace anything.
[138:50.40]No, that's not what I want.
[138:56.48]No, stop.
[138:57.56]Let me do this.
[138:58.12]Okay.
[139:07.79]okay so it is it's legs body skin and nose I think are the different ones okay cool let's go another one of these what was this one I forget what this one does
[139:37.55]Is there a way for me to see?
[139:38.29]Where is Amber?
[139:47.40]Oh, it's the third eye.
[139:50.60]Give it to Gunu?
[139:51.92]You want Gunu just to be completely stacked?
[140:05.77]Okay, if Gunu dies, it's a problem.
[140:08.80]Like actually a problem.
[140:11.21]OK.
[140:17.18]I think that's good.
[140:35.44]He just gets uglier and uglier.
[140:37.34]Hey, don't say that.
[140:40.71]How dare you?
[140:46.77]Fill up on water.
[140:50.55]Yeah, so the reason why cube didn't work is it changes body.
[140:54.81]So we gotta keep that in mind.
[140:56.61]I'm going to forget every single one of these, so please help.
[141:02.49]I think we should have a swimmer.
[141:06.68]You.
[141:09.13]You.
[141:09.79]Swim!
[141:38.01]There we go.
[141:41.34]Crystals.
[141:44.60]I got a lot of these.
[141:45.18]I need to spend them.
[141:48.46]Should everybody just glow in the dark?
[141:51.25]Temporarily?
[141:55.41]They're not dying, are they?
[141:56.77]Wait, what's going on?
[141:57.71]Are they okay?
[142:12.94]I need light.
[142:13.88]I think it's alright.
[142:14.90]I'm going to make a couple more people.
[142:24.85]They can't jump that eventually I can teleport them.
[142:28.15]I just can't see there we go.
[142:29.23]Cool.
[142:32.15]Everybody should be there.
[142:39.44]They are OK.
[142:43.72]Crystals.
[142:52.72]Alright, that way.
[142:53.32]Well, hold on.
[142:56.66]What's this?
[143:02.08]Oh, it's cube.
[143:02.78]It's a cube.
[143:03.34]Alright, who should be a cube?
[143:08.40]You.
[143:10.35]Vu.
[143:12.57]You're the cube.
[143:15.03]No, Gunu can't be a cube.
[143:16.13]Okay.
[143:31.20]Alright, somebody else's, uh... You're the biggest one, so just go.
[143:42.22]Now that is not an attractive cube, it's just a cube.
[143:46.09]There was a place where somebody could go.
[143:49.03]I wonder if I'm going to wrap around now.
[143:54.05]Yeah, OK, so cool, let's go.
[143:58.44]There's a place where you could go.
[144:00.40]Where was it?
[144:03.42]Back this way.
[144:07.32]Yes.
[144:10.33]Alright cube, get in there.
[144:29.64]Whoa.
[144:30.56]Okay.
[144:32.92]A mower.
[144:33.52]A ball.
[144:42.03]Now what?
[144:43.97]Encountering another elder was a happy moment.
[144:47.37]The Trebom asked how they might survive the cylinder.
[144:51.26]And the elder replied, I can feel your fear, little ones.
[144:56.24]Ever since this cataclysm began, we have been seeking ways to stop it.
[145:00.81]but the cylinder is relentless and indestructible.
[145:05.36]It will consume everything in its path.
[145:08.56]So perhaps what we need to do is go behind it.
[145:14.45]I have discovered a mutation that allows us to rise into the sky.
[145:19.29]You must seek a weeping tree from which grows a special fruit that floats as it becomes ripe.
[145:26.15]It is the key to the transformation I have undergone.
[145:30.08]With it,
[145:31.00]You can use geysers to float well above the cylinder's height.
[145:35.04]My only regret is that I have grown too old and weak to help you with this task.
[145:41.13]If you find any glimmer of hope on the other side, remember me.
[145:47.33]Farewell.
[145:52.13]Alright.
[145:54.71]I have to eat a special food.
[146:00.19]Now the question is, is it on the map?
[146:03.77]No.
[146:06.59]It's a special tree to get us to float.
[146:31.14]Can we use this thing?
[146:33.50]Wait, somebody's dead?
[146:34.48]Who died?
[146:35.10]Somebody's dead?
[146:36.60]Is this hurting us?
[146:51.16]No, Guna's not dead.
[146:52.36]He didn't just die somewhere.
[146:53.86]No way.
[147:04.84]Where's everybody?
[147:08.82]Shogunu on cam.
[147:12.73]Oh, hold on.
[147:13.19]Alright, yeah, where the fuck is everybody?
[147:27.24]There's Guno.
[147:30.98]Um...
[147:32.65]Am I supposed to be doing?
[147:33.87]I can't float through that.
[147:35.91]But I found this tree.
[147:36.97]Well, where is it?
[147:42.90]Can't go up that way.
[147:43.76]Can I just leave?
[147:46.26]I guess I'll just go out this way.
[147:55.03]Stand by.
[147:55.35]Yeah, I knew I could go out the door.
[147:56.81]I just didn't know if I was supposed to get here.
[147:58.45]Okay.
[148:24.89]So it's just a big log rolling.
[148:30.71]Interesting.
[148:31.09]The Trebom had never seen this mysterious tree the Elder spoke of.
[148:37.65]They would have to keep moving forward and hope it lay somewhere ahead.
[148:42.72]The cylinder would give them no other choice.
[148:45.52]Okay.
[148:49.72]Alright, so let's get
[148:52.14]And the big dragon is gone.
[148:55.30]So that's a plus.
[148:58.94]Everyone just coming to the stream right now.
[149:00.24]What do you mean?
[149:00.74]Big dragon?
[149:01.44]What the fuck?
[149:02.66]Yeah, man.
[149:03.98]Should have saw it.
[149:06.02]And I actually might sound like I'm being sarcastic, but it actually was really cool.
[149:12.53]Okay, there's some... What is this?
[149:13.47]It's pointing over here.
[149:14.53]Mm-hmm.
[149:24.88]So there's that way.
[149:27.40]He's pointing over here though.
[149:37.36]Still good on food.
[149:46.37]Maybe somebody should be tanky.
[149:49.17]Yeah.
[149:51.53]You.
[149:52.81]Why?
[150:02.89]Oh, wait.
[150:03.77]I forgot.
[150:04.21]That's not the right one.
[150:05.81]Well, it's okay.
[150:08.49]You just make water.
[150:21.50]Is this food?
[150:24.29]I wonder, can I eat anything without this?
[150:25.67]No.
[150:27.19]No.
[150:32.90]So correct me if I'm wrong, and this, uh, I think this is accurate.
[150:39.03]This is made by the same team that did Xenoclash.
[150:41.91]Do you guys remember Xenoclash?
[150:43.49]Do you remember that game?
[150:50.66]That game was wild.
[150:53.90]They're actually making another Xenoclash game, aren't they?
[150:57.71]Coming out soon, I think.
[150:59.49]But same team.
[151:01.37]It... I mean, that would... I mean, all the character designs, it looks very much like Xenoclash.
[151:10.43]Whoever is their... Whoever is doing the character designs and the concept work for Ace Team or the Xenoclash team... It's like next level.
[151:21.72]They're unbelievably good.
[151:26.13]um alright I'm gonna go touch that wait didn't I already see this am I am I crazy the new xeno game looks actually really cool yeah it's like a dice game but then it turns into sort of like a third person action game after you play a game of dice or something I'll probably play it it looks really interesting did I touch this already oh yes we're gonna store people right right right right alright
[151:56.85]We are going to store one of our... Yeah, we're going to store a lamp.
[152:04.43]Who do we want?
[152:05.19]Yeah, we're going to store... Store Grutemu.
[152:12.17]Makes sense.
[152:12.58]Alright, Grutemu, you're getting stored.
[152:16.88]In case we need a lamp.
[152:26.08]Unu stays.
[152:28.58]Gua stays.
[152:29.72]Bu stays.
[152:31.16]Wugwul stays.
[152:35.91]There he goes.
[152:36.57]Okay, so we have... It was kind of... Everyone kind of has a purpose at this point.
[152:49.13]One, two, three, four, five.
[152:51.07]Okay.
[152:52.39]That wasn't the lamp?
[152:55.30]Yeah, it was.
[152:57.63]Who is the most important?
[152:58.71]The most important one has to stick around.
[153:05.87]We need two lamps in there.
[153:12.43]Get out.
[153:14.84]That should be safe.
[153:16.32]You shouldn't be able to get over here.
[153:21.16]Get out of here.
[153:22.66]Okay, we're in trouble.
[153:27.59]Something else is moving over here now.
[153:29.25]Oh my goodness.
[153:29.86]Alright.
[153:30.12]No, no.
[153:30.40]Go, go, go.
[153:30.80]Just get out.
[153:31.26]Get out.
[153:31.50]Get out.
[153:31.66]Get out.
[153:32.94]We stored one.
[153:33.78]We gotta go.
[153:34.16]We gotta go.
[153:34.54]We gotta go right now.
[153:35.16]I'm going now.
[153:56.14]Plenty of health.
[153:57.96]Find this tree.
[154:01.06]Oh shit.
[154:02.90]Oh shit.
[154:03.95]Oh shit.
[154:05.75]Big problem.
[154:07.11]Somebody can swim, can't they?
[154:08.41]Who can swim?
[154:09.89]Who can swim?
[154:10.51]One of you swims.
[154:11.27]Who swims?
[154:12.35]Who's the swimmer?
[154:14.39]Who swims?
[154:15.93]Somebody swims, right?
[154:17.63]Who swims?
[154:18.95]Nobody swims?
[154:20.97]Nobody swims.
[154:21.57]I stored the swimmer.
[154:23.04]We're dead.
[154:32.47]I stored the swimmer.
[154:34.08]Okay.
[154:39.88]Hold on.
[154:43.56]Was he there?
[154:44.26]I don't think so.
[154:48.59]Oh, fuck off.
[154:54.35]We told you to store the lamp.
[154:57.83]Okay, you're going in there, and I'm bringing out the swimmer.
[155:02.97]What's your name?
[155:06.08]Woogwool.
[155:06.54]Alright, Woogwool, go in there.
[155:08.82]And we're pulling the swimmer out.
[155:11.80]The thing is going to kill all of us in one second.
[155:18.80]Okay, Woogwool going in.
[155:23.47]Rutemu coming out.
[155:42.63]Where's the swimmer?
[155:43.37]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[155:45.15]Wait.
[155:49.44]Wrong?
[155:50.62]Hold on a second.
[155:51.34]Who has the swimming ability?
[155:54.98]It's hard to tell.
[155:55.84]Does Wugwool have swimming?
[156:04.22]I wish I could see their traits right here.
[156:18.59]None have the swimming.
[156:19.33]You lost it.
[156:21.71]How did I lose it?
[156:22.52]Didn't somebody just get it?
[156:23.38]Somebody had webbed feet, right?
[156:27.46]It is Wugwool.
[156:28.12]Okay.
[156:31.74]Alright, so then Grutemu goes in.
[156:33.36]Because Grutemu is just literally just glowing and jump.
[156:37.58]Okay, put Grutemu in.
[156:47.69]Yeah, we did.
[156:48.03]We had it right the first time.
[156:48.88]Yeah.
[156:50.24]I just freaked out because I didn't realize that you had the webbed feed.
[156:52.54]Alright, let's go.
[156:53.22]Alright, Wugwool, where are you?
[156:57.28]You know, you know, you know what threw me off?
[156:59.31]It was the fact that, um, Wugwool is glowing.
[157:02.59]Okay, I need to take a look at the map.
[157:11.68]Oh, fuck.
[157:15.42]We okay?
[157:16.00]Everyone okay?
[157:16.88]Alright.
[157:17.38]I need to look at the map.
[157:21.97]I think I can just swim across this with Wugwool.
[157:28.01]I think Wugwool can make it.
[157:35.17]Oh!
[157:37.88]Get away.
[157:46.63]Okay, it's moving.
[157:47.19]Alright, Wugwulf.
[157:49.33]You need to eat, and then you swim in over there.
[158:00.74]Come on, use your trait!
[158:03.78]Yes!
[158:04.93]I think it's gonna work.
[158:09.93]Don't even look back.
[158:47.15]Okay, so we're gonna go the long way.
[158:50.67]There's not enough stamina.
[158:55.15]I need to upgrade my stamina to try something like that again.
[159:00.52]So I got to go around the water.
[159:02.00]Okay.
[159:03.32]This game is cool.
[159:04.04]I like this game.
[159:04.76]It's fun.
[159:06.72]Well, you're going to spawn me right here.
[159:11.45]Don't Luigi me.
[159:12.73]I'm still learning.
[159:13.79]Do not Luigi me, please.
[159:15.81]I'm not going to hear that right now.
[159:18.25]But hold on.
[159:26.87]Will you get out of here?
[159:28.87]Seriously, get out of here.
[159:35.74]We just got to move.
[159:37.22]Oh my God.
[159:38.30]Just go.
[159:42.13]Where's the, okay.
[159:42.69]Where's the water?
[159:44.65]Water.
[159:44.91]I just got to go straight wrap around.
[159:46.73]I need food.
[159:48.50]Just go.
[159:54.55]Pick the worst possible way to go, man.
[160:35.04]No!
[160:35.74]I don't think I can do it.
[160:38.05]I don't think I can do it.
[160:41.25]I'm not- I don't think I'm gonna make it.
[160:42.43]I don't think I have enough stamina to make it the whole way.
[160:52.46]Maybe I do.
[160:52.96]Uuugh!
[161:07.96]Yes!
[161:08.34]Okay, I got it.
[161:10.58]We're good.
[161:11.16]Everything's fine.
[161:12.20]Everybody relax.
[161:18.63]Now we need to eat.
[161:23.67]They were still nowhere near the mysterious tree they were supposed to find.
[161:28.54]But the voice in their memories encouraged them.
[161:31.47]It was wise in matters of root and rock, and it could sense the soil under their feet changing.
[161:37.75]Oh no.
[161:38.57]Step by step, they were getting closer.
[161:42.25]The thing looks dangerous.
[161:45.95]You got food reserves, don't you?
[161:49.57]You ate it.
[161:51.73]You ate it.
[161:53.25]Why did you eat it?
[161:53.88]I didn't want you to eat that.
[162:03.43]I mean, it was a good thing, but that's for emergencies.
[162:06.38]Don't eat that.
[162:06.86]Okay, let's keep going.
[162:19.11]A couple points of interest over here.
[162:21.79]But wait.
[162:29.21]No!
[162:31.49]No!
[162:34.14]Do that again.
[162:34.52]It doesn't work.
[162:46.74]Alright.
[162:47.09]I think he does it eventually.
[162:48.39]We just have to get back and once he's not.
[162:53.89]Okay.
[162:59.63]The snail gets out for a certain reason.
[163:01.23]I don't know why.
[163:11.16]So should we give the attractive power up to Gunu?
[163:18.20]Or keep the glow?
[163:19.08]I wonder how it works.
[163:53.72]Cool.
[163:59.87]I kind of miss the lighting it gives, though.
[164:05.27]Alright.
[164:06.09]So... Let's go over here.
[164:17.17]I wonder why you would need to be attractive, right?
[164:21.45]I wonder if there's something that ends up happening later or something.
[164:24.66]I don't know what it would be.
[164:34.52]Point of interest.
[164:35.14]Oh, who's in here?
[164:45.82]I need somebody that can fight.
[164:47.32]Okay.
[164:57.15]Who's in here?
[165:01.15]Govu.
[165:04.33]You need a mushroom and you need four mushrooms and three crystals.
[165:08.77]What's up?
[165:14.38]Govu.
[165:17.90]We got Govu.
[165:20.56]Ooh, I like Govu.
[165:23.18]Orange.
[165:24.84]Cool.
[165:29.30]We're just a bunch of weirdos.
[165:30.66]Alright, we gotta go.
[165:45.48]Uh, back to that point of interest.
[165:46.92]It's like a temple.
[165:55.44]Get in.
[165:56.87]Get.
[165:59.07]Uh.
[166:00.25]Don't.
[166:02.63]No.
[166:03.31]Somebody died.
[166:04.05]What?
[166:04.59]Who died?
[166:05.85]Who died?
[166:06.59]Somebody got spit on and died.
[166:08.41]Who was it?
[166:09.55]Gwuwu?
[166:10.75]Where's Gwuwu?
[166:12.89]Which one was Gwuwu?
[166:18.78]Did we just... No, not the one we just got.
[166:20.86]Oh, okay.
[166:23.83]You're fine.
[166:26.13]It was... Gwuwu is gone.
[166:28.05]I don't even remember who the fuck that was.
[166:30.41]If I'm honest.
[166:32.15]So, I don't know.
[166:35.77]Who was... Who was Gwuwu?
[166:44.05]Alright.
[166:44.50]We need to make a decision here.
[166:49.59]Was Guwu the purple?
[166:53.27]Okay.
[166:55.85]Max health.
[166:56.55]Hold on.
[166:59.71]He doesn't even care.
[167:01.18]No, I just don't remember.
[167:02.24]Okay, I remember the Gunu shining.
[167:08.34]Cube is Vu, right?
[167:09.74]You're the cube.
[167:10.40]Cube.
[167:12.01]Glow, uh, I remember the glow one is Wugwul with the webbed feet.
[167:16.77]The new one, Govu, is the orange one.
[167:20.51]And then Gwe is the one with the big head.
[167:24.76]I don't remember the other one.
[167:29.38]Sorry that they got, um, like, obliterated.
[167:34.04]I don't even know what to say.
[167:44.97]Alright, we definitely need leadership.
[167:48.11]So this is maximum number of Trebom.
[167:50.11]I definitely want it.
[167:50.77]I think that lets us have seven.
[168:03.86]I wonder what else.
[168:04.42]Probably do it twice.
[168:15.36]water storage this is pro this is important and stamina I do both food storage food storage and stamina or water supply and stamina or stamina and another party member
[168:43.81]Is this game multiplayer?
[168:44.71]I don't think so.
[168:46.34]I think it's just like a little single player campaign.
[168:48.66]Food and stamina.
[168:58.50]Stamina and leadership again.
[169:01.66]Well, I know I'm doing stamina, so where is it?
[169:03.26]It's over here somewhere, right?
[169:05.48]What about health?
[169:07.86]I mean, one of our best friends got just annihilated in a second.
[169:17.54]That's expensive.
[169:19.26]Stamina... Do I even have enough to do anything?
[169:23.52]I could do stamina health.
[169:24.44]I have 7.5, so... Food capacity is probably... Water and food capacity is important, I think.
[169:33.09]Or I could just do another one.
[169:43.68]Food is important.
[169:47.78]Food's important.
[169:56.70]Oh.
[170:00.03]So I got food, stamina, and that's it.
[170:10.50]Cool.
[170:11.36]You can revive.
[170:12.06]It probably costs money, though.
[170:13.28]I don't know if I'm going to do that yet.
[170:15.89]I'm afraid I'm going to open this door and there's going to be... I think it's going to be here.
[170:32.62]Yep!
[170:37.78]Out, out, out, out!
[170:46.20]Are we safe?
[170:51.81]One, two, three, four, five.
[170:56.09]It just hit me.
[170:57.05]I'm gonna cry.
[170:57.81]We lost... We lost Guogui.
[171:02.57]It's hitting me right now.
[171:03.61]I'm actually sad.
[171:04.57]It just hit me right now.
[171:08.01]So awful.
[171:12.92]That's not his name.
[171:19.24]That is the equivalent of, like, if your son's name was, like, David.
[171:24.18]And it's like, oh no, you, something, oh, we lost, where, where, where, where's, uh, Dread, Dread, Dread, Dread, Dread, Dread, Dread, like, you don't have your own fucking kid's name?
[171:37.35]Hey, uh, honey, do you have any idea where Dread is?
[171:51.76]A new friend.
[171:55.46]You want three mushrooms and three crystals.
[171:58.66]I don't have enough.
[171:59.28]There's an egg thing here, though.
[172:01.27]Why are you so poor?
[172:10.75]I just spent like a million bucks upgrading everybody.
[172:14.27]There's an egg incubation thing here, though.
[172:17.61]I need to find the egg.
[172:20.27]Where's the egg?
[172:21.91]I need an egg.
[172:27.78]Hmm.
[172:31.92]I don't even.
[172:36.34]There's a cave here?
[172:39.47]There's a cave here.
[172:42.13]Alright, I'm going to go to the cave.
[172:43.33]Let's see.
[172:45.01]I'm just going to go straight.
[172:49.10]Wait.
[172:50.02]Okay.
[172:53.27]OK, yeah.
[173:14.91]Food.
[173:16.23]I'll pick up food in a second.
[173:17.21]There's a cave here though.
[173:18.25]It's like right here somewhere.
[173:23.71]Where is it?
[173:24.11]Right here?
[173:26.49]Right here?
[173:34.90]Where is it?
[173:37.54]Oh, there it is.
[173:37.94]Alright, let's go in.
[173:41.72]Ooh.
[173:43.56]Ooh.
[173:43.94]Get that.
[173:53.27]Can I pick that up?
[173:59.18]Spray it.
[174:09.67]Oh, I'm hungry.
[174:10.61]Anybody have food?
[174:12.85]Somebody that has food.
[174:15.21]Nobody has any food.
[174:20.37]What the fuck are we doing?
[174:28.61]Just wait, get some food.
[174:49.42]Alright, fuck off.
[174:50.56]No, fuck off.
[174:52.20]I can't wait to... When can I throw like a grenade down that thing's throat?
[174:57.07]I'm serious.
[175:00.51]Okay.
[175:01.33]Back up.
[175:02.37]Get the aggro.
[175:08.10]Good.
[175:08.32]Okay.
[175:08.88]Let's head down there.
[175:16.29]Should I make anybody else shiny?
[175:18.35]Ooh, you know who should be shiny?
[175:20.45]You.
[175:22.49]You're going to look cool shiny, right?
[175:24.85]Will it be orange and shiny?
[175:26.25]Give it to the cube.
[175:35.00]We need an attractive cube again.
[175:44.54]Yeah.
[175:46.24]Yep, good call.
[175:49.41]Good call.
[175:51.57]Alright, let's go in the hole.
[176:04.05]So what's down here?
[176:11.52]Friend.
[176:13.10]And... Five!
[176:16.95]Wugwu.
[176:17.53]I don't have five.
[176:28.76]Sorry, buddy.
[176:34.64]Come back, maybe.
[176:44.19]Help him, please.
[176:49.16]I don't think I'm going to... I spent too much money.
[176:52.62]We got the orange guy.
[176:55.76]Unfortunately, I think that's where his final resting place is going to be.
[177:00.06]I'm going to go up here.
[177:02.22]There's also a potential egg somewhere.
[177:08.79]We can hang out for a minute and see if we can find it.
[177:22.92]You're making us cry?
[177:24.88]Well, there's nothing I can do about it.
[177:26.86]We chose, um... Govu.
[177:31.85]This is who we picked.
[177:32.81]We picked Govu.
[177:37.33]Govu's pretty cool.
[177:38.79]Govu already has jump.
[177:56.28]Okay.
[177:57.08]What about over here?
[178:01.14]Egg.
[178:02.60]Looking for an egg.
[178:11.31]Whoa!
[178:11.73]I forgot what that thing was.
[178:17.71]That was my bad.
[178:28.28]Alright.
[178:33.10]I think we just have to go.
[178:34.82]Does anybody have toxic defense?
[178:37.06]We could go down.
[178:38.36]Alright.
[178:41.52]Everybody get toxic defense.
[178:42.60]Everybody has it, right?
[178:48.26]Does the cube have it?
[178:51.84]Yes.
[178:52.10]Alright.
[178:52.32]Let's go down.
[178:52.76]Probably something down there.
[178:59.07]Right on the edge here, though.
[179:00.01]I'm not going to activate it, am I?
[179:05.73]I hope not.
[179:09.10]What's down here?
[179:16.00]Nothing?
[179:19.40]No.
[179:19.86]There's got to be something here.
[179:29.62]What?
[179:35.95]What?
[179:41.43]There's really nothing down here.
[179:44.11]Junk.
[179:46.97]Well, okay.
[179:47.41]I'm not missing something, right?
[179:54.37]No?
[179:55.33]Maybe it's a place to hide, maybe?
[180:00.95]From one of those monsters.
[180:06.10]Alright.
[180:06.62]I got to pick the way that I want to run here.
[180:08.72]I think it's going to be.
[180:11.20]Alright.
[180:13.48]So I'm going to come across this brush over here on the left.
[180:15.84]I'm just going to go wham straight up here.
[180:24.69]An egg by the hole.
[180:29.47]Give it one more look.
[180:34.88]We got that.
[180:36.50]Let's see one.
[180:44.10]Egg by hole, egg by hole.
[180:46.94]Let's see it.
[180:48.84]Where?
[180:52.52]We need water.
[180:53.06]Yeah, I'll get water.
[181:06.64]Can we get out?
[181:07.76]He almost got sprayed!
[181:20.16]Oh my god, he's so fast.
[181:26.20]We gotta move.
[181:29.48]We gotta move, we gotta move.
[181:30.52]This thing is just comp- We gotta move.
[181:32.87]I'm moving.
[181:41.32]Who has fins?
[181:44.21]Which one of you has gills?
[181:45.09]You do.
[181:45.37]Alright, as long as one of you has gills or whatever the hell it is.
[181:51.50]That works for me.
[181:54.70]The swimmer is dead?
[181:59.84]that died alright well I'll give it to um to get out of here for it oh oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no everybody dies here everybody dies here no don't poison them all please everybody get out please everybody get out get out get out get out get out we good oh thank god I'm so happy
[182:31.13]He's so tired.
[182:32.03]OK, we're safe.
[182:44.26]Very nice.
[182:44.78]Do we need any bigger people?
[182:49.00]I don't think so.
[182:49.68]Alright, I'm eating up and we're getting out of here.
[182:57.64]Oh, I thought you guys said I killed this warmer.
[183:00.46]You have another swimmer.
[183:01.38]Oh, I thought that Wugwe died and Wugwe was the swimmer.
[183:06.88]Well, okay.
[183:09.01]Alright.
[183:10.93]I gotta move.
[183:11.77]This is a horrible route.
[183:14.05]I need to go this way and up.
[183:16.35]Or fuck it, whatever.
[183:17.47]I'll make it work.
[183:18.03]I think it's okay.
[183:24.18]Okay.
[183:34.38]Come on.
[183:42.12]Move!
[183:42.68]Oh, we gotta go now.
[183:44.22]Don't get caught by that thing.
[183:45.34]I don't know what that thing's doing.
[183:49.15]This thing's trying to... I think it's trying to suck somebody up.
[184:01.28]We're all here.
[184:04.67]OK, gotta get to here.
[184:09.85]Go.
[184:15.88]This is a risky move.
[184:17.56]Very risky, incredibly risky.
[184:21.26]But I think it's going to work out.
[184:26.07]Shaving some time.
[184:31.85]Oh shit.
[184:34.23]OK, I gotta calm down.
[184:35.35]I gotta calm down.
[184:36.75]Come on, you're good.
[184:38.31]Everything's fine.
[184:40.25]Oh my God, it's right there.
[184:42.89]I made a mistake.
[184:53.91]Shit.
[184:56.15]It moves so fast.
[184:57.75]It moves really fast.
[185:00.19]OK.
[185:03.67]Auto-save is right there.
[185:04.61]We're okay.
[185:10.09]Good thing you got the crystals.
[185:11.63]I know.
[185:12.05]It was stupid.
[185:16.12]But there's so many crystals in there.
[185:17.56]Alright, let's go.
[185:22.84]Okay.
[185:49.51]Who's the fastest?
[185:51.41]Probably who knew?
[185:55.98]This game has me so invested.
[185:57.46]Yeah, kind of.
[186:00.68]It's just I don't know.
[186:01.72]It's cool.
[186:03.02]Alright, I'm thinking straight ahead from here.
[186:05.88]Just go.
[186:06.26]Get out of the way.
[186:14.47]Go straight.
[186:15.71]And then I gotta go right.
[186:17.85]When it drops.
[186:24.10]I gotta go right left.
[186:43.35]What is that thing?
[186:43.91]Is that a bad thing?
[186:48.23]Wait, what is that?
[186:49.87]What is that?
[186:59.46]Oh, it's one of those flying things.
[187:01.24]I got you.
[187:05.28]Come on, go.
[187:06.06]And then it's over here.
[187:15.43]Right ahead.
[187:25.08]Blue smoke will refill your stamina.
[187:26.86]That's unbelievable to know.
[187:28.12]Thank you.
[187:36.20]Okay, we're safe.
[187:40.44]Very nice.
[187:40.90]Ooh, pretty.
[187:44.04]Cool.
[187:50.15]Does anybody still have a horn?
[187:55.99]Can you please explain this game?
[187:57.23]I am very confused.
[187:58.41]This game is called the Internal Cylinder.
[188:01.61]The game gives you an area to work with.
[188:06.50]You find little creatures that you have join your party.
[188:09.50]There's a bunch of upgrades.
[188:12.61]The internal cylinder.
[188:14.13]The eternal cylinder.
[188:18.31]And once you leave the Fortnite circle, the game crushes and destroys everything that was before.
[188:27.73]And you can only move forward.
[188:32.29]Pretty cool.
[188:33.41]I got my little party here.
[188:35.77]Seem to be doing pretty... Seem to be doing okay.
[188:38.49]One of them died.
[188:40.37]Got obliterated by poison.
[188:47.15]What was this monstrous creature?
[188:51.39]Was this one of the Cylinder's servants?
[188:53.57]Jesus.
[188:53.89]The ones the Elder had warned them of?
[188:57.77]Its very form terrified the Trebon.
[189:02.01]Even the voice on their memory seemed frightened of it.
[189:06.38]And then, somehow, the Trebom remembered the creature's name.
[189:10.74]Mathematician.
[189:11.48]It was called the Mathematician.
[189:19.94]Well, I say we don't go over there.
[189:21.10]We need water?
[189:30.18]How are we doing on water?
[189:38.03]We need to eat.
[189:39.69]Very badly.
[189:44.51]Who else has food?
[189:45.72]Give it to Gunu.
[189:46.12]OK.
[189:53.32]Just get rid of these things.
[190:01.41]Yeah, get rid of those.
[190:04.61]There's no reason for you to keep carrying these.
[190:07.74]I'm gonna be pissed if I need these for some reason.
[190:13.02]You can't become double Q, but just food, right?
[190:15.12]Yeah.
[190:19.22]No, we don't need these.
[190:19.86]Okay.
[190:27.63]Um... Oh my god!
[190:32.89]Crawling back over the cylinder!
[190:36.40]The mathematician is horrifying as quickly as he had appeared back to.
[190:41.80]To what?
[190:43.72]What lay behind the cylinder?
[190:47.38]We need to know.
[190:48.86]I'm very I'm I'm completely invested.
[190:50.78]Alright, what's on the map?
[191:03.91]Nothing, no points of interest anymore.
[191:06.99]I'm going to explore over here a little.
[191:10.86]There is.
[191:14.78]No temple.
[191:15.80]That's really pretty.
[191:19.26]It's beautiful.
[191:31.32]I wonder what those things do.
[191:32.38]They're kind of scaring me, so I'm not going to hear them.
[191:44.46]Something over there now.
[191:45.76]Wheels?
[191:49.34]Mm-hmm.
[191:53.75]I think the guy is rolling the cylinder like a joint to smoke with Jerma, with the people happy.
[192:01.55]So... I don't even... I don't even know...
[192:12.54]I love that peepoHappy face.
[192:14.52]I love Peepo.
[192:15.36]Peepo's just so funny.
[192:19.70]Egg.
[192:21.76]Egg acquired.
[192:26.97]Somebody's dying here, and I don't know who, but someone's gonna die.
[192:34.67]Right.
[192:38.91]This looks very difficult, whatever that wants me to do.
[192:41.35]I need an incubator.
[192:45.63]Get that shit out of here.
[192:50.36]Incubator.
[192:51.82]Incubator.
[192:59.56]Incubator.
[193:17.87]One of those cars.
[193:24.27]This shit down there, but I don't want anyone to get just rushed so.
[193:52.84]It's safe right there.
[193:56.50]I would not.
[193:56.88]Don't jump down.
[193:58.14]Don't jump down.
[193:59.20]That's a very bad idea.
[194:01.88]Don't jump down.
[194:03.22]You're going to get yourself crushed.
[194:07.49]Please come back this way.
[194:10.07]Don't be silly.
[194:23.06]I don't see an incubator.
[194:26.74]I don't want to go too far.
[194:39.59]Is there one over there?
[194:41.97]This piece of shit is going to drain all of our powers.
[194:47.02]I'm just taking it with us.
[195:01.58]I'm going to be careful.
[195:02.24]I'm going to be very careful.
[195:12.67]I'm at the edge of the map here.
[195:14.59]I'm going to go left.
[195:17.59]I'm going to go that way.
[195:24.59]Behind you.
[195:26.19]Don't say that.
[195:31.55]I think there's new shit down there.
[195:34.23]What is that?
[195:34.77]I need to see.
[195:37.19]Mm.
[196:17.54]We have to do this now.
[196:24.02]I can't sprint with the egg.
[196:32.32]Perfect placement.
[196:33.88]Don't tell me that wasn't perfect placement.
[196:39.68]We made it.
[196:40.06]We made it.
[196:40.56]Slow.
[196:41.02]Slow down.
[196:41.58]Slow down.
[196:41.88]I think we can get out this way.
[196:53.90]Can I get up that?
[197:02.47]Oh, come on.
[197:03.05]I have the super jump.
[197:06.87]Yes!
[197:12.37]We all here?
[197:15.13]Where's where?
[197:18.31]Where?
[197:19.79]Where's where?
[197:22.34]Where's where?
[197:26.60]Oh, no.
[197:26.88]Everybody's here.
[197:27.22]There's five.
[197:28.76]Wait.
[197:30.50]I'm losing track of my children.
[197:33.40]No, we're all here.
[197:33.94]Okay, we're here.
[197:40.09]Incubator over there.
[197:42.65]And there is a... I think there's a baby in one of those.
[198:00.24]Should get two here.
[198:08.28]Aha.
[198:10.36]And then there's somebody in there.
[198:16.73]Wewom.
[198:17.13]Alright, Wewom, welcome to the family.
[198:22.77]And Vopo wants three turnips and three crystals.
[198:31.62]Okay, well, I already gave the crystals, so we need the turnips.
[198:34.66]They're all over here.
[198:35.30]Here you go.
[198:42.28]Who ate one?
[198:44.54]There were two here.
[198:45.34]Who ate the other one?
[198:46.44]Why did you eat it?
[198:48.70]Why did you eat the turnip?
[198:51.08]One of you ate one.
[198:52.10]Wait, did you eat it or did you have it in your inventory?
[198:56.93]Who has it?
[198:59.31]They ate it.
[199:09.29]I need another turnip.
[199:15.05]There's got to be one more here somewhere, right?
[199:22.17]Bro, you had to eat the one other turnip that we needed.
[199:26.15]You couldn't have eaten anything else.
[199:27.39]A flower, a mushroom.
[199:28.47]You had to eat the turnip.
[199:37.43]Where is it?
[199:49.39]How can I tell how this is working?
[199:57.27]Will it ping or beep?
[200:02.10]Is it on the map?
[200:08.04]Yeah, I'll try it on like this plant and see what it does.
[200:13.46]Just a regular one.
[200:20.98]Those are like everywhere.
[200:21.92]Okay, so that's what it does.
[200:23.98]You're telling me there's not one even remotely in this vicinity?
[200:28.01]God damn it.
[200:36.62]Shit!
[200:37.54]Well, I need to remember the way this is in the map.
[200:39.06]It's right here.
[200:49.22]Your children inherited your lack of self-control.
[200:57.02]We needed... I'm not going anywhere.
[200:58.40]That was three full crystals.
[200:59.94]I'm not wasting that.
[201:01.76]I'm not leaving until we find another turnip.
[201:09.93]There better be another one on this world.
[201:19.23]Come on.
[201:24.75]There's no turnips in this whole land anymore.
[201:28.87]Not anywhere.
[201:42.67]Shit.
[201:43.52]Well, let's get water.
[201:56.00]Do kids have the hiccups?
[201:56.92]They're suffering.
[201:58.73]They're OK.
[202:05.19]One turn it better not be the death of this.
[202:08.61]Thing here.
[202:11.21]Hasn't even picked up anything.
[202:25.51]This reload save.
[202:26.61]I don't know how far back out.
[202:29.53]How far back would that be?
[202:32.51]19 seconds ago or 14 minutes ago.
[202:34.77]I don't know another 15 minutes.
[202:39.35]That seems kind of far.
[202:55.93]I don't know what that means, but I don't like it.
[203:05.28]I need one turnip.
[203:08.38]Just one.
[203:09.00]Just need one.
[203:33.62]They respawn.
[203:34.34]I think they would be coming up on the radar if they did, right?
[203:46.41]I think there are no turnips.
[203:56.30]I looked everywhere.
[204:03.18]No.
[204:08.37]Check back.
[204:09.97]Yeah, I'll just go back to where I was.
[204:13.27]That was over here.
[204:22.14]I do need to eat, though.
[204:23.16]Hold on.
[204:23.36]Plenty of whatever these things are.
[204:29.48]Coral Reef.
[204:31.54]Doesn't help me.
[204:36.97]I thought you were a plant.
[204:41.50]OK, let's make our way back.
[204:59.97]That's an interesting thing going on over there in the distance.
[205:02.34]I don't know if that is.
[205:07.50]Alright, it's over here.
[205:11.34]There ain't any- There's no fucking turnips.
[205:13.06]They- They- Wait!
[205:14.59]Wait a minute!
[205:14.91]These are the trees!
[205:15.65]These are the trees!
[205:16.25]I need to eat these!
[205:17.55]These are the flying trees!
[205:19.73]I'm very excited right now.
[205:23.13]Finally, the weeping trees that the Elder had told them to find were within the Trebom's grasp.
[205:30.38]But though the Trebom were happy, they realized that they faced a new challenge.
[205:37.04]The ripe fruit were floating out of reach and the others were enclosed in a hard shell.
[205:43.73]They would have to find a way to crack them open.
[205:58.16]Like that.
[206:00.70]This is... We need to experiment on somebody.
[206:08.94]You.
[206:09.10]The one that looks like a goldfish.
[206:13.24]You do it.
[206:15.22]Good luck.
[206:16.76]Godspeed.
[206:41.31]This power is stupid.
[206:44.41]Okay, so they can float.
[206:45.71]Should everybody have this?
[206:48.99]I wonder, because this is probably body, right?
[206:55.79]Or does this count as something else?
[207:01.72]I wonder... Will they all just fly?
[207:08.54]I'll take a few because I want to make sure I have a few.
[207:13.07]Just for later.
[207:17.73]Test it on the cube.
[207:20.17]That's a good call.
[207:21.93]Alright, what happens if you eat this?
[207:31.42]Why did that not break?
[207:44.10]Okay, so it does count as body.
[207:54.40]Who doesn't have a body thing?
[207:57.66]Disco ball.
[207:59.18]I think it's okay.
[207:59.64]As long as one of them has it, right?
[208:02.30]I think that's fine.
[208:06.28]It's an attractive balloon now.
[208:10.63]Yeah, we're good.
[208:11.79]Okay.
[208:13.55]Can't roll anymore?
[208:14.21]Yeah, I can.
[208:16.07]Alright, turnips.
[208:17.45]Turnips.
[208:18.89]Very important.
[208:24.49]I need one.
[208:29.22]Maybe water the turnip plant.
[208:30.46]I'll try it.
[208:30.86]I want to investigate this, too.
[208:35.46]Whatever this is.
[208:36.00]Hmm.
[208:48.16]I wonder if I can get up the top.
[209:02.90]There's nothing up there.
[209:26.64]Are they in danger?
[209:27.84]I'm... Get out of the way.
[209:41.19]You know, why don't you take a horn?
[209:43.09]Yeah, um, give it to you.
[209:46.57]Weep womp.
[209:48.64]Maybe that can scare him away.
[209:55.63]OK, let's try this.
[210:00.03]Does this work?
[210:03.63]Get out of here.
[210:11.57]Get out of here.
[210:23.74]Keep going further.
[210:43.05]Don't eat somebody.
[210:43.70]Everybody follow me up here.
[210:50.88]Follow me up here.
[210:53.40]Is everybody alright?
[210:57.36]What's in... There is some magical shit up here.
[211:01.17]What is that?
[211:03.39]There's magical shit up here.
[211:07.25]Um...
[211:14.91]Who should eat this?
[211:18.89]You?
[211:20.15]Can I eat it?
[211:21.84]Should I give it to the disco ball?
[211:25.54]Give it to Gwegwam.
[211:27.40]I don't know who that is.
[211:28.06]Should I give it to Weewam?
[211:36.63]Give it to Wugwool.
[211:43.25]Uh, what wall is not up here?
[211:44.59]Where, okay, where is everybody?
[211:45.61]I got what I needed from here.
[211:48.27]What about the second layer here?
[211:57.27]Anything here?
[211:57.82]Holy shit.
[212:07.18]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[212:10.09]Whoa, whoa!
[212:12.21]No!
[212:12.49]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[212:15.39]Alright.
[212:19.23]I'm freaking out for no reason.
[212:20.29]We're safe.
[212:22.41]We're all here, right?
[212:23.90]Thank God.
[212:27.82]I actually... That was as if one of my children was actually in danger.
[212:36.20]Okay.
[212:37.44]I'm going to give it two.
[212:44.54]Guys, Wegwam's not even here.
[212:46.91]I'm going to give it a Weewam.
[212:51.11]I think Weewam should have it.
[212:52.25]Okay, who's got it on them?
[213:01.95]Weewam.
[213:05.43]Yeah.
[213:06.41]Alright, Weewam.
[213:08.47]Try it.
[213:16.95]Meteor feet?
[213:18.77]I can do a ground pound.
[213:31.06]Those legs.
[213:32.72]Should've given it to Gunu.
[213:34.86]I didn't know what it was though.
[213:39.85]I wonder if I can stomp on this thing now?
[213:42.96]This is a really bad testing of hypothesis here.
[213:47.31]But I mean.
[213:57.49]Thought I had the horn, but I don't know who is the horn.
[213:59.51]We're good.
[214:06.88]OK.
[214:11.46]Is there any turnips over here?
[214:14.91]What do you need?
[214:18.39]God damn it.
[214:23.00]No fucking turnips or anything either.
[214:24.56]Oh, I can change.
[214:41.67]That's what was going on.
[214:42.55]Okay.
[214:47.78]Well, got some new abilities.
[214:48.96]Found the tree.
[214:51.60]Now let's go back to the turnip.
[214:53.00]Turnip is down here.
[214:56.87]And then I'm imagining I probably have to float over.
[214:59.75]Let me just see if the turnips respond.
[215:04.59]Is that a chest?
[215:06.78]Or is that... What do you mean?
[215:09.64]Is it a chest?
[215:12.50]Maybe.
[215:16.64]Maybe.
[215:25.61]Just an inactive roller.
[215:28.65]That's cool.
[215:39.68]Alright.
[215:40.60]There's the ball with the turnip.
[215:44.10]Don't think I can get it.
[215:48.44]Uh, try anything on the pillar?
[215:49.56]Yeah, that's... What is that?
[215:52.52]That's the... What power is this?
[216:01.11]Don't stomp your friends, please.
[216:05.51]That's the third eye, yeah.
[216:06.57]Good to have.
[216:09.01]I'm just storing it.
[216:09.57]Maybe somebody else should just have it.
[216:11.97]I'm going to give it to the stomp.
[216:22.10]Look at them turnips.
[216:22.68]We got a raid.
[216:25.50]Oh, we did have a raid.
[216:26.16]Automated.
[216:27.74]What's up, Otto?
[216:29.09]What's up, Otto?
[216:32.18]Next to the red auto.
[216:35.96]We having a good night?
[216:42.19]Try to water.
[216:42.83]Yeah, I'm heading over there now.
[216:49.40]Turnip.
[216:57.49]There were three turnips here.
[216:59.53]One, two, three.
[217:02.81]And you ate one of them.
[217:05.15]You did.
[217:06.00]You ate one.
[217:07.16]And now we cannot save our friend.
[217:10.34]And we have to abandon the friend now.
[217:12.58]We wasted three crystals.
[217:14.38]I'm glad you ate it.
[217:16.45]I'm glad it was delicious.
[217:18.53]But you wasted three crystals.
[217:20.11]That's a huge amount of currency.
[217:31.46]This one looks a little more green to you.
[217:43.13]I can't take the crystal back.
[217:46.85]Water for more than half a second.
[217:48.25]I mean, we're all just sitting here watering it.
[217:59.48]No, it's not going to work.
[218:02.64]That's sad.
[218:04.02]Unfortunate.
[218:07.98]Unfortunate.
[218:12.07]I got my thing that finds... I think that's it.
[218:16.79]I think we lost three crystals.
[218:29.09]Alright.
[218:32.78]Shit.
[218:35.34]That's so sad.
[218:36.92]Okay.
[218:38.24]Well, we're leaving.
[218:43.53]Save him.
[218:44.03]I can't.
[218:46.31]Unless I reload a save from like 40 minutes ago.
[218:48.81]It's alright.
[218:53.55]I'll get the crystals back.
[218:59.73]So the play here...
[219:02.58]is I have to float over this to get to here.
[219:08.21]Where's the cylinder?
[219:09.79]Cylinder is all the way back there.
[219:10.99]I should be in a fine spot to float over.
[219:14.89]Let's see.
[219:27.40]So if I go... I wonder... Oh, no, no.
[219:29.82]There's a closer one.
[219:30.62]Here it is.
[219:34.08]I'll take a few more of these.
[219:34.94]I'm just going to keep them.
[219:36.54]I'll store them on somebody.
[219:39.22]Who knows when the hell I'm going to get access to this again.
[219:54.95]Save.
[219:55.63]I think it just saved right now.
[219:59.45]It is saving.
[220:00.45]Okay.
[220:02.68]Uh, where's my float friend?
[220:04.10]There you are.
[220:04.60]Okay, here we go.
[220:06.68]Okay.
[220:18.19]What is that?
[220:24.09]Even with the ability to float, overcoming the cylinder would have to be done very carefully.
[220:29.95]What they needed was a geyser that was well-positioned, close to the cylinder when it lay still, or their plan would never work.
[220:39.49]They would have to keep looking, and meanwhile, they would try not to think about what sort of monster could kill one of the flying serpents.
[220:48.08]Can I get up here?
[221:03.02]Oh, okay.
[221:09.57]Okay.
[221:11.09]In order to float above the eternal cylinder, you must find a geyser that is close to the cylinder when it lies dormant.
[221:17.42]The eternal cylinder will never allow the Trebim to jump over it while it is advancing.
[221:22.26]Okay.
[221:27.32]Okay.
[221:34.18]I mean, I guess I gotta.
[221:35.28]I gotta just kind of.
[221:36.02]I gotta go.
[221:58.57]Everyone's making it.
[221:59.19]We're good.
[222:00.69]OK, here comes the border.
[222:01.49]Order here.
[222:03.27]Alright, look.
[222:12.66]Holy shit.
[222:14.62]Uh... Really bad timing.
[222:18.36]Really bad timing.
[222:21.52]Go.
[222:28.53]Ah!
[222:28.65]We're good.
[222:39.97]Mmm...
[222:43.51]Bro, why?
[222:44.49]No, no, no.
[222:45.91]Um, no.
[222:48.11]Um, no.
[222:48.85]Okay.
[222:49.79]The whole family made it.
[223:14.20]Barely.
[223:20.94]Cold.
[223:25.00]Interesting.
[223:25.50]He just
[223:45.49]You just ate the... Why'd you do that?
[223:48.07]That was mean.
[223:50.35]You're on kind of a mean streak right now.
[223:55.32]Okay, is there a geyser here?
[224:03.47]I would imagine not.
[224:05.75]Probably later.
[224:15.90]What the fuck is that?
[224:19.02]That's terrifying.
[224:21.20]It's sniffing.
[224:22.16]Okay.
[224:29.45]It's out of here.
[224:30.99]Oh, please.
[224:32.15]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[224:33.09]Just, I don't know.
[224:33.73]I don't know where to go.
[224:35.35]I don't know where to go.
[224:41.63]Um, we need coats.
[224:45.61]We need coats.
[224:53.51]Look at the chat.
[224:54.01]Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[224:56.16]It's a geyser, geyser, geyser.
[224:57.70]It was?
[224:58.10]Where?
[224:58.56]I was being, I see it right there.
[225:00.00]I was getting chased by this weird bird elephant thing.
[225:25.56]Uh... What the fuck?
[225:51.85]Our home!
[225:52.55]Our world!
[225:59.74]Oh, that's ominous.
[226:03.85]Drop down.
[226:05.83]What if I just run across?
[226:11.53]Cover their eyes.
[226:12.23]I don't know if this is a good idea.
[226:37.13]It's the other side of this thing.
[226:56.37]That's new.
[226:57.72]Is it new?
[226:58.24]No, it's not.
[227:05.27]Oh my God.
[227:11.75]Get back up.
[227:12.67]Let me go back up please.
[227:15.59]We just we're just going to get out of here.
[227:17.35]It's going to get out of your hair.
[227:27.32]What just happened?
[227:36.92]Are we all here?
[227:37.44]Holy shit.
[227:39.64]The gang goes up against a god.
[227:43.05]This is very bright.
[228:10.55]I remember the mountains of my home, the vast forests, the clouds hanging low over here, the statistics of the bodies where the rivers run.
[228:21.51]I remember the faces we shared, and the songs we sang when the stars rose high.
[228:28.39]But I have forgotten the names of all these things, and slowly one melts into the other.
[228:35.32]My children will become mountains.
[228:37.60]The forests will become songs.
[228:41.10]And then all will become one and be nothing.
[228:44.85]We lost a couple people.
[228:47.17]I think they're fine, though.
[228:49.19]There was something hidden in this place.
[228:52.47]And the voice wanted the Trebom to find it.
[228:55.25]DMT breakthrough.
[228:57.61]Dude, I don't know.
[228:58.30]I took DMT.
[229:00.30]I was a little fucking weird frog person.
[229:04.36]It was fucked up.
[229:07.66]I was eating things that gave me different powers.
[229:11.90]Running for this giant cylinder.
[229:13.56]This really does feel like an acid trip.
[229:14.94]Somebody explaining to you their acid trip.
[229:18.39]And its great observatories scour the sky for wisdom and beauty.
[229:24.60]That is where we first saw the new star.
[229:31.40]Each voice was a memory.
[229:34.22]A song from a forgotten time, slowly fading.
[229:38.89]Oh god, hold on.
[229:39.53]I don't want to make anybody sick.
[229:42.35]Memories of things that Trebom had once been capable of.
[229:46.93]Perhaps, the voice suggested, these could be reclaimed.
[229:52.96]I remember how our towers stretched out to the sky, yearning for the stars.
[230:01.13]They were symbols of our best and our worst.
[230:05.37]I remember our voices echoing in the canyons as we fought for change, for a world that was different.
[230:17.98]Then it came and the towers fell.
[230:21.61]Somebody said cool math games.
[230:25.03]Where are our voices now?
[230:27.67]Where are our songs?
[230:30.77]I only hear one and it is eternal.
[230:38.11]So what are we?
[230:38.97]Are we?
[230:39.39]I'm very curious.
[230:40.81]I guess we're just walking.
[230:45.70]As the memories returned to the Trebon, old abilities stolen by the cylinder were finally restored.
[230:55.04]But there was so much more.
[230:57.76]The voice had answers, but it was weakening.
[231:03.65]Frightening as it was, the Trebon would have to come back.
[231:08.93]Sacrifice Gunu.
[231:09.91]I'm getting contact high from this game.
[231:18.54]Okay.
[231:31.43]Wait.
[231:32.63]He's rolling it!
[231:33.03]This was a place of death and nothingness.
[231:36.77]There were no answers to be found here.
[231:39.63]The voice on their memories urged them to return to the lands of the living.
[231:44.95]He's the one rolling it.
[231:46.61]It's not just like a sentient thing.
[231:48.35]It's he's he's wrote.
[231:50.81]Wait, there's like stuff here.
[231:54.08]Yeah.
[231:55.26]Crunchies.
[232:02.40]What this thing was, we saw this before this weird skeleton.
[232:09.10]There's not a time to celebrate by the way.
[232:12.00]Just saying.
[232:22.17]That's interesting.
[232:23.07]So I... This is freaky.
[232:29.53]This is the movie trailer for the gritty reboot of Q-Bert.
[232:37.07]Well, I guess we're going back, but... Take that.
[232:45.04]Yeah, this time, this time, he's uncensored.
[232:55.70]I don't look so good.
[233:12.22]Hey, get over here.
[233:19.18]What is that thing?
[233:19.92]Um!
[233:25.33]How do I save him?
[233:27.33]No, Govu!
[233:28.92]Govu's dead!
[233:29.80]Govu's dead!
[233:31.84]He's the one that can float!
[233:33.86]Excuse me?
[233:37.12]Come on, come on, we gotta go, we gotta go.
[233:40.60]Wait, float, please?
[233:41.56]Govu's dead.
[233:43.70]What the fuck is all this shit?
[233:46.51]I'm sorry, but this was not over here?
[233:55.46]To make matters worse, ahead of them lay the cold and snowy lands of the tundra.
[234:01.23]Not a very nice place for Trebom, who are not meant to live.
[234:04.77]Get out of the way.
[234:05.29]Get out of the way.
[234:05.97]We need the... Okay.
[234:07.79]Okay.
[234:08.39]Narrator, this is not a... Please stop talking to me.
[234:11.48]They could find help.
[234:14.15]We need to get warm right now.
[234:16.23]I can't believe.
[234:18.01]Okay, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[234:20.53]Ah, we're good.
[234:20.85]God damn.
[234:21.03]That was so sad.
[234:23.05]That thing is coming back, and I don't know how to deal with it.
[234:45.60]It's just taken my Govus and whatever these things are.
[234:51.46]Where do I need to go from here?
[234:53.30]There is no map.
[234:56.89]Okay, I'm just going this way.
[234:58.09]Is Garrett with a horn?
[235:00.07]Come here.
[235:14.92]Get the fuck out of here.
[235:15.98]Get out of here!
[235:19.95]That's for Govu!
[235:41.14]Ooh, water.
[235:42.20]Yeah, take it.
[235:44.68]I have the stomp ability too with this.
[235:51.18]Oh, what is this?
[235:53.14]I don't want to lose the stomp.
[235:55.55]I don't want to.
[235:56.67]Who should I give this to?
[235:57.61]This game is 13 hours long.
[236:11.36]That's cool.
[236:12.72]I'm going to give it to you.
[236:13.56]Because I feel like you got the webbed feet, but what else do you got?
[236:21.16]The yellow guy?
[236:21.76]Actually, the yellow guy doesn't have anything.
[236:27.16]Very true.
[236:36.49]Ignites a small flame at the tip.
[236:43.08]I got a fire.
[236:44.98]Blow blower.
[236:46.18]OK, do you don't get burnt to death, please?
[236:49.23]What is that thing?
[236:54.17]I don't this thing is interesting.
[236:55.51]I don't know what it does, but I have it now.
[236:59.43]Big like burning rock.
[237:03.63]OK, I'm going to throw this at somebody.
[237:08.47]What's that?
[237:11.22]The same thing.
[237:16.28]It's like a jewel.
[237:17.04]Ah, alright.
[237:20.32]Kind of like a lantern, maybe?
[237:33.64]Oh my fucking god, I need to eat.
[237:34.92]You're right.
[237:35.26]I just completely forgot it existed.
[237:51.24]Should I cook the food?
[237:53.62]What happens if I cook the food?
[237:58.30]Do anything different?
[238:01.76]I don't think so.
[238:08.37]Get the heat source back?
[238:09.43]Yeah, I will.
[238:10.69]Want to eat a bunch of food?
[238:15.65]You need to avenge Govu.
[238:18.59]I don't know if I can do that.
[238:22.57]OK.
[238:22.63]We're good.
[238:25.34]I'm going to get that heat source back.
[238:35.20]I'm just taking it with us.
[238:40.81]Will light the bird on fire.
[238:51.84]This game is 69 hours long.
[239:00.14]Go roast that motherfucker.
[239:01.76]No, it's OK.
[239:06.84]I am going to check down here though.
[239:17.56]This.
[239:28.88]Is he doing anything?
[239:33.14]No.
[239:38.67]Are you afraid of the bird?
[239:42.31]I mean, maybe a little.
[239:45.65]He instantly killed one of my friends.
[239:47.43]Of course, I'm going to be a little apprehensive.
[240:03.87]Alright.
[240:05.14]I don't want to leave yet.
[240:06.04]There's nothing really down here.
[240:07.18]Alright, I got a question for you.
[240:12.02]We can do a poll.
[240:14.62]Do you want to see me complete this game?
[240:18.64]Yes or no?
[240:20.22]If the answer is yes, this is what we will play.
[240:22.44]That's a lot of yeses.
[240:28.02]Alright.
[240:28.74]We don't even do a poll.
[240:29.61]It's not necessary.
[240:37.79]I wonder what this thing is for, though.
[240:39.71]Alright.
[240:40.15]Gunu, you need to get food.
[240:41.55]A lot of it.
[240:47.32]Gunu should be the one doing this.
[240:52.30]Give all the food to Gunu.
[240:53.36]92%.
[240:58.15]Damn, okay.
[240:59.41]One of those motherfuckers over there.
[241:07.86]Alright, that's plenty.
[241:13.58]Never gonna play sorcery ever again.
[241:16.52]Yes, I will.
[241:16.96]I promise.
[241:17.32]Look at this little guy.
[241:26.39]Um, that's... Alright, what's this?
[241:29.21]Who should eat?
[241:29.63]Who's gonna eat this?
[241:37.27]Uh...
[241:40.19]Bugwool?
[241:46.07]You think so?
[241:46.45]Alright, Bugwool, you eat this thing.
[241:50.15]Probably a spiky head.
[241:54.63]What are you doing?
[241:55.41]They're just rubbing their butts.
[241:56.67]What were they doing?
[241:57.51]Okay.
[242:00.75]Alright.
[242:01.68]Time to mutate.
[242:10.07]analytical eyes you can tag creatures and add them to your compendium there you can find important information about their behavior with this new pair of eyes well to be perfectly honest they felt rather silly but despite that
[242:27.39]The voice in their minds told them, with these eyes, they could learn much about the creatures they encountered.
[242:34.75]Okay.
[242:35.25]The voice was glad about this.
[242:37.29]It was knowledgeable in the manner of animals, and now it could contribute its wisdom to their memories.
[242:45.18]So I can tag monsters and try to avoid them or something, probably.
[242:50.66]What's the big shadow?
[242:52.68]What's the big shadow?
[242:53.68]It's that.
[242:59.67]This game is so scary.
[243:03.39]OK.
[243:05.21]Uhm.
[243:06.61]I still can't see, but.
[243:09.25]I know it's up there.
[243:10.03]Plenty of food.
[243:17.00]I got the cold resist.
[243:22.70]Pat, I wonder what I give it.
[243:24.62]What happened to that egg that I had?
[243:26.00]That is completely just get rid of it.
[243:32.90]How are you just activated as a quest?
[243:36.64]It does go to that.
[243:54.74]It makes me hungry.
[243:56.50]I guess you probably do.
[244:00.83]Probably not going to stream that much longer.
[244:05.27]You probably imagine some of these later night just hangout streams will be not like eight hours long.
[244:17.48]OK, hold on.
[244:20.74]I'll finish it though, I will.
[244:26.46]Pink and green.
[244:29.89]Cool.
[244:37.49]I'll do this tower this whatever this little zone thing in here.
[244:42.73]Wait, where's my hornblower?
[244:46.35]Where's my hornblower?
[244:47.11]Hey, fuck you.
[244:55.70]Good.
[245:10.27]If you see anything, yell.
[245:13.68]Really doesn't like the horn.
[245:15.52]At all.
[245:22.72]Oh!
[245:29.75]I think they're okay.
[245:31.63]They just got smashed in the face.
[245:34.47]Looked like it hurt a little.
[245:36.77]But it's okay.
[245:37.53]Oh, fuck.
[245:41.82]Fuck you.
[245:44.92]Get that thing out of here.
[245:46.00]I don't want that thing swooping down.
[245:47.12]Everybody alright?
[245:48.49]Where's Guna?
[245:49.25]Guna's right here?
[246:01.29]What's that?
[246:03.18]Oh, shit.
[246:05.68]Oh, it's just water.
[246:06.70]Hmm?
[246:13.23]I think this is an upgrade place.
[246:15.91]But I don't have that much.
[246:19.71]Should I even go in here?
[246:20.65]Because when I get out, it's going to walk it behind me.
[246:30.89]Commit to it.
[246:32.37]Yeah, you should save it.
[246:34.15]I don't... I feel like I kind of have to just get out of here.
[246:39.30]Yeah, it should give me a couple.
[246:40.48]I don't know if it's enough, though.
[246:51.35]Okay, activate.
[246:55.37]How much can I get?
[247:02.15]Save up for the guy you just saw.
[247:06.66]Yeah.
[247:08.00]I gotta go into more caves underground more.
[247:10.86]I feel like I'm lacking... Well, I did upgrade a lot last time.
[247:14.60]Okay.
[247:29.99]four I wonder should be about five maybe I'll get from this what am I lacking I feel like the water is not a problem um maximum water it's six I don't think I have enough to do anything
[248:06.55]I don't think I can do anything.
[248:11.48]I could do health.
[248:12.68]Health is four, right?
[248:20.04]Stamina.
[248:23.15]Health is four.
[248:23.91]I could do health or save it to be able to get somebody.
[248:34.19]Save it.
[248:35.35]Save it.
[248:35.77]Save it.
[248:36.11]Save it.
[248:37.97]There's a new party member outside.
[248:40.85]Yeah, I'll save it.
[248:42.02]We want friends.
[248:43.14]We don't need upgrades.
[248:47.26]Big splash.
[248:52.58]No health.
[248:53.16]No health.
[248:54.98]I think we've got plenty of health.
[249:05.17]Although I say that when we've seen a couple of tragedies that happened very quickly.
[249:14.74]So I can understand that maybe we don't have enough help.
[249:18.58]But I'll save it.
[249:19.18]Let's go.
[249:30.45]Govu got his neck snapped.
[249:34.92]It was really sad.
[249:36.00]I felt so bad about it.
[249:37.82]Alright, so here's the plan.
[249:44.16]Before it gets too, too late, we'll call it here.
[249:47.83]I'm gonna upgrade.
[249:49.65]Well, not upgrade.
[249:52.15]I'm gonna... Where was that person?
[250:04.98]Hmm.
[250:08.01]No!
[250:08.93]How do I get out?
[250:09.41]Get out!
[250:09.63]Get out!
[250:12.77]Shit!
[250:15.17]No!
[250:16.09]No, it didn't happen.
[250:17.11]It didn't happen.
[250:17.69]It didn't happen.
[250:18.93]It didn't happen.
[250:19.45]The save is... Yeah, it never happened.
[250:23.54]Sorry.
[250:24.10]I'm not letting that happen.
[250:24.96]That never happened.
[250:26.68]That's it.
[250:27.20]See you later.
[250:28.32]Stream over.
[250:29.36]Didn't happen.
[250:32.24]It did not happen.
[250:33.89]We're good.
[250:39.12]Save scum.
[250:39.86]That's fine.
[250:41.88]Bro, you need to put both earbuds in.
[250:43.50]We heard it.
[250:48.15]Oh, man.
[250:48.77]Alright.
[250:50.65]Next time I see you guys, we'll probably come back to this on... I don't know.
[250:57.01]Friday?
[251:01.09]We'll probably do Friday, Saturday.
[251:02.51]Friday, Sunday.
[251:09.15]We'll try to finish this on... If it's like a 12-hour game, like 11 to 12?
[251:13.59]We'll go for a little bit longer on Friday.
[251:19.35]And then Saturday... There's a couple things I want to do on Saturday.
[251:29.32]But we'll finish it.
[251:30.58]We'll finish it up on Friday.
[251:33.44]And then the weekend we'll do some fun stuff too.
[251:40.61]So we'll start.
[251:44.39]Honestly, I really like this nighttime slot.
[251:48.52]Kind of brings it back to like 2016, 2017.
[251:55.22]Starting at like 6 or 7 o'clock.
[251:59.28]It's a nice change of pace.
[252:00.42]I really like it.
[252:09.88]You must have commercial brain.
[252:11.92]Yeah.
[252:12.06]Yeah, I think the the later night I think just kind of lets me just kind of breathe a little bit.
[252:26.51]Relax.
[252:30.17]I very much like it.
[252:31.15]A lot.
[252:34.55]We'll go back to sorcery.
[252:36.01]We'll finish this.
[252:36.71]We're going to do a lot of stuff.
[252:40.59]So you can expect Friday, Saturday, this weekend.
[252:47.32]And yeah.
[252:48.94]I'm very interested in what this game even is.
[252:52.50]So we're definitely going to finish it.
[252:53.54]Eternal Cylinder starting at about 6 p.m.
[252:59.81]Pacific on Friday.
[253:00.81]If you want to come chill, by all means, please do.
[253:07.11]And then Saturday, I don't know, what...
[253:09.68]We might need to finish this on Saturday.
[253:12.90]For an hour or two.
[253:14.36]And then move on to something else on Saturday.
[253:16.98]We'll probably do Saturday afternoon.
[253:18.66]Not Saturday night.
[253:21.07]But we'll see.
[253:23.65]Thanks again for watching.
[253:24.61]Thanks for chilling.
[253:28.09]Didn't really have a big kind of long game plan with these
[253:37.33]But I'm having fun.
[253:38.55]Breath of the Wild, I will finish Breath of the Wild.
[253:40.75]I promise you that Hold on, I was like, I've been holding a burp for the last four straight minutes.
[253:51.12]Okay.
[253:53.32]I promise you we're going to be playing a lot of just games and relaxing.
[253:57.58]So don't worry.
[254:02.26]Breath of the Wild, I'll finish it.
[254:03.94]I'll finish Sorcery.
[254:04.74]I'm going to finish this.
