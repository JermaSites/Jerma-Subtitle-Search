[00:05.12]Team Fortress 2.
[00:07.00]My old friend, so we meet again in the fields of battle.
[00:11.10]It's been a long time since Team Fortress 2 appeared on my channel, has it not?
[00:14.53]Well, we're bringing it back in style with mini decapitations, letting these snipers know they are not welcome here on Harvest, playing as possibly my favorite class, the Demoman with the Eyelander and the Splendid Scream.
[00:27.13]So I've got the sword and shield, my sole objective in life is to run people down with my blade
[00:33.10]And I become faster with each head that I take.
[00:35.06]So at the bottom right of the screen, you can see I've already collected six heads.
[00:38.25]Make that seven.
[00:39.37]And with every passing one, I get a little bit more health on my max health at the bottom left.
[00:43.53]And I move a little bit faster.
[00:44.72]That's why it seems like I'm going faster than a scout right now.
[00:48.04]I'm not going to spend too much time talking about the gameplay, I just wanted to use Team Fortress as a backdrop for a few other things I wanted to bring up and just have a general discussion with you guys.
[00:57.24]I did want to point out however there is a little bit of heavy gameplay after this with the strange festive minigun and sandwich and some lovely holiday gloves as well as some live commentary with my friends Jerma985 and BooMan61.
[01:11.33]If you're interested in their channels, links in the description of this video, but stick around for that little bit of hilarity.
[01:16.81]Recently, I've been playing Team Fortress 2 probably more than I have in the last, what, seven years of its existence, and there's a few factors that have been contributing to that, and I'm curious how many of you share my afflictions
[01:29.55]What I mean is, I've recently taken up Team Fortress 2 trading in some limited fashion.
[01:33.67]For those of you unfamiliar, there's a bunch of items ranging from hats to different types of shirts and coats and garb and little familiars and owls that you can have on your shoulder.
[01:44.65]Two weapons, of course, being the Strange Festives, for example, like I'm using in this particular video with my Strange Festive minigun, which, at the time of that recording, was the most valuable item that I owned.
[01:55.24]And I've been taking them and trying to turn those items around into something slightly more in my favor to try to work my way up the trading ladder.
[02:01.47]I'm curious how many others out there actually do that, who watch my videos.
[02:06.07]How many of you are addicted to it?
[02:07.13]How many of you used to do it and stopped?
[02:09.25]And how many of you play Team Fortress right now and never knew that this existed?
[02:12.60]You might be thinking, well, it's not a big deal if you just swap an item with a friend.
[02:16.12]That's what Steam inventory is for.
[02:18.43]But some of these things are worth like 100 bucks, 200 bucks.
[02:22.37]even upwards of $400.
[02:24.84]It's insane, and I honestly can't believe that a game like this that's this old has managed to cultivate such an economy.
[02:30.74]It boggles my mind, it fascinates me, and that's why I do it.
[02:33.20]I just wanted to let you know that's what I've been doing for some reason.
[02:36.38]I don't know why I can't stop.
[02:38.24]But I've been playing a lot of Team Fortress 2, just playing it for fun mostly, not playing it for profit or anything like that, because it's, trust me, certainly not been profitable for me.
[02:45.11]I think what fascinates me most about the trading economy is the fact that it's all for vanity's sake.
[02:51.26]It's almost entirely not functional.
[02:54.96]The whole reason you want to work up towards that cool, unusual hat with that special effect...
[03:00.11]It's just that you can go into a server and show it off and let everyone know that you're better than they are.
[03:04.17]There's really no other purpose, and what's great about that is anyone can play the game and never have to worry about that.
[03:10.72]If you don't care about how you look in the game, you're not gonna have a worse experience than anyone who does.
[03:17.01]But it's weird how deep some people's pockets can go just to satisfy their need to look amazing, to look fabulous.
[03:24.37]But that's fine.
[03:24.81]I'm not going to judge anybody because I've had my fair share of wanting to look fabulous inside of a TF2 game.
[03:30.16]You know, got my Demoknight here with his crown and his cape and his kilt like a true Scotsman.
[03:36.18]And I've also got, you know, a couple other dudes that I've got outfits for.
[03:39.28]This must be what it feels like to be a woman.
[03:41.04]Is this what it feels like to desire to go clothes shopping all the time?
[03:44.80]Alright, I'm done.
[04:01.25]of this thing.
[04:01.93]Come this way.
[04:07.80]Watch out.
[04:08.12]Spy.
[04:08.34]Spy.
[04:08.46]Spy.
[04:08.72]Spy.
[04:11.90]No.
[04:12.58]No.
[04:17.50]Oh my... Thank goodness.
[04:23.14]Oh my god, dude.
[04:24.23]They just keep... Oh my god.
[04:27.53]There's more.
[04:28.25]I'm going to get stair-stabbed.
[04:33.20]Dude, I... I've killed like seven people with this thing.
[04:37.70]Yeah, I know.
[04:39.04]What's going on?
[04:40.16]Alright.
[04:40.72]No, I accidentally took it out again.
[04:42.88]I'm gonna have to kill someone again.
[04:43.98]Oh, there's a Mini-Sentry out there.
[04:45.27]Run.
[04:46.07]Watch out!
[04:46.51]Spy!
[04:47.75]No!
[04:49.09]Thank you.
[04:49.67]Out of the carry.
[04:50.49]No!
[04:51.01]God, what'd you... What the... I got him.
[04:54.73]Everywhere.
[04:55.43]I got him.
[04:58.54]They just kept, like, coming in that room.
[05:01.30]They couldn't get a break.
[05:03.50]Jerma, I have survivor's guilt.
[05:09.22]Hey, it was eventually going to happen, right?
[05:13.12]Yeah, but, you know, maybe not.
[05:17.23]I thought we were going to make it there for a little bit.
[05:18.93]I had a little glimmer of hope.
[05:21.57]We probably would have.
[05:22.35]If there was no Mini-Sentry there, we probably would have been fine.
[05:27.31]That is a spy, for sure.
[05:31.81]And there's a Mini-Sentry over here.
[05:34.63]Oh boy!
[05:37.79]No!
[05:38.53]Look it, it's out of ammo.
[05:39.71]It's out of ammo, wow.
[05:40.79]Yeah, it was out of ammo.
[05:44.19]There's another one there.
[05:47.70]Where's this other one?
[05:48.60]It's up top.
[05:53.22]I direct shot that guy so many times.
[05:56.92]Crab's a spy much?
[06:01.27]Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[06:02.01]I'm stuck.
[06:02.33]I'm stuck in the corner.
[06:03.04]Oh my goodness.
[06:03.92]Oh my goodness.
[06:05.58]Where are you?
[06:06.04]Oh, he knows I'm here.
[06:06.96]Oh, you're stuck back there.
[06:08.00]Oh, I didn't know you were stuck back there.
[06:34.25]you
