[00:06.90]Thank you.
[00:08.34]Hey, what's up everybody?
[00:09.54]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:12.92]Gonna be playing as the Scout tonight, using the default Scattergun, the Crit-a-Cola, and of course the Candy Cane.
[00:19.56]Pretty much my default Scout setup.
[00:21.62]Koth Nucleus is the map we're playing on right now, and it's a very good Scout map.
[00:26.60]If you've never played Scout on King of the Hill Nucleus, I don't think it's even possible.
[00:30.60]But if you've never done it before, there are so many places for you to juke people out, fake them out, jump over one place, land on another.
[00:37.70]It's awesome.
[00:38.62]You're gonna see me do that a couple times in this gameplay, and there are like two or three fails where I just like jump into the ocean or like the pit down there.
[00:47.09]Oh, there you go.
[00:48.85]Just happened right now.
[00:51.45]But for the most part, it's a pretty decent gameplay.
[00:54.85]So what is this video going to be about?
[00:57.71]Well, if you saw in the title, this is gonna be another personal story.
[01:01.48]And it's actually very, very personal.
[01:03.52]This is not like on my 100 upload video when I talked about my YouTube channel.
[01:07.90]I'm gonna talk about something really important in my life,
[01:10.74]And it's an illness that I have, and an illness that I'm going to currently live with for the rest of my life.
[01:16.60]I'm not dying, don't worry.
[01:18.02]This is not like Jerma saying, hey, I'm dying.
[01:20.44]No, that's not going to happen.
[01:22.01]But it is something that totally changed my life.
[01:25.37]For the better, I think, actually, to be completely honest with you.
[01:28.15]I think my life is better now after having this disease.
[01:32.41]And let's just get right into it here.
[01:34.01]I have Crohn's disease.
[01:35.77]If any of you know what that is, Crohn's disease, it can be called a bunch of different things.
[01:39.96]Ulcerative colitis, colitis, Crohn's disease, there's a lot of names for it.
[01:44.12]But I haven't.
[01:45.24]And I got diagnosed with it when I was a senior in college.
[01:48.24]And it came very, very close to totally, 100% ruining my life.
[01:54.03]Because I was a senior, and I had all kinds of projects I had to do.
[01:57.39]I was in my last year of college.
[01:59.29]I wasn't doing so well in school at that point, and this was just on top of that.
[02:03.65]And I think my GPA my senior year was like 2.4 or something, 2.3.
[02:10.04]Something not that good.
[02:12.12]But the reason why I said in the beginning that this was sort of a life-changing thing for the better is because... Well, let me explain to you what Crohn's disease and what colitis, what it does to you.
[02:22.11]Essentially, when you have Crohn's disease...
[02:24.68]You get stomach aches like every day.
[02:27.38]You have like these ulcers in your intestines.
[02:30.02]It's a disease that affects your intestinal tract.
[02:32.88]So it can get pretty weird sometimes, especially when you have these massive horrible stomach aches.
[02:37.91]And Crohn's disease can affect all around your entire body.
[02:41.05]So it can affect your stomach, your intestines, your small intestine, your throat.
[02:45.39]It can go all the way down your entire digestive tract.
[02:48.51]And it's a big pain in the ass, like literally, if you catch my drift.
[02:54.28]But it's totally changed my life for the better.
[02:56.78]And why I say that is because I can't drink anymore.
[03:00.94]I can't eat horrible, bad foods anymore.
[03:03.36]I can't really go to McDonald's every day and get like a Big Mac every day.
[03:08.78]and it really sometimes it can get to you though like I'll go out with my friends I'll go to parties or something like that and drinking for me like having alcohol is a big deal I can only really do it like three or four times a year because it kills me it literally is killing me if I drink alcohol so it has to be on special occasions like I have like weddings new year's like obviously new year's Christmas like the major holidays is when I can do that
[03:34.78]And like I said, it can get really down on you.
[03:36.78]You can go, well, I want to have some damn fun too.
[03:38.82]What the hell?
[03:39.80]This sucks.
[03:41.06]But then you really have to think about it.
[03:42.18]You go, well, I just got dealt these cards.
[03:44.76]I can't do anything about it.
[03:46.39]And there is no cure for Crohn's disease.
[03:48.47]It's a manageable disease.
[03:50.01]There's no cure.
[03:51.43]And I'm going to live with it probably for the rest of my life.
[03:54.13]and I guess I'm making this commentary because I want to know if any of you guys that are watching this video right now if anybody has a loved one or a friend or even if you if you're comfortable talking about your illness or your disease or something like that I mean I would like to hear about it because it's it's cool to know that there are other people in the world
[04:12.43]that are kind of like you they have similar problems similar issues maybe not the exact same problems but they still have them and if you are totally not comfortable like I said talking about this thing you don't have to it's just I'm just kind of throwing this out there letting you know something very very important about my life and if I can make it even one or two of you guys feel better about something you're going through because I'm going through it too
[04:36.07]It's just crazy.
[04:37.03]Like, when I got diagnosed with this, I was just like, what?
[04:39.57]I was like, no way.
[04:41.53]Like, screw you, doctor.
[04:43.70]What do you know?
[04:45.12]And it just kind of went from there, and I'm just managing it right now, and I'm taking medicine for it.
[04:48.60]That seems to work.
[04:49.98]So I think I'll be okay, but it's still something I have to live with for the rest of my life.
[04:54.49]So there you go, though.
[04:55.33]There's another personal story of mine.
[04:57.29]I've got a couple others that I could share with you at some point.
[04:59.45]I won't do this that often, but I'll do it often enough if I have something I want to share with you guys or something I want to talk about, then I will absolutely make a video of it.
[05:07.72]And that was why I made this video, because I've been having somewhat kind of problems with it lately and figured I would talk about it, right?
[05:13.29]Why not?
[05:14.23]And I guess the final thing I would add to this commentary is don't let something like this ruin your life.
[05:20.17]Don't let some type of disease or some type of illness really put you down six feet under because it's not worth it guys.
[05:26.30]It can seem really terrible at first but after a while you start to really
[05:30.40]think about it more into the big picture rather than the small picture and modern medicine has come literally light years since like the eighties even the nineties so who really knows what's gonna happen in the next twenty years in medicine who knows in twenty years we might be flying spaceships you know who knows what the hell's gonna happen so keep a positive attitude guys if you're living with something crazy keep a positive attitude you don't want to get yourself sulking down into like hell
[05:58.19]So this is going to be the end of the commentary, guys.
[06:00.87]Thank you so much for watching.
[06:02.37]I really do appreciate it.
[06:03.55]We actually get on the point on overtime, and we cap it to win the game.
[06:07.01]So thank you guys so much.
[06:08.31]I will talk to you soon.
[06:09.77]Take care, everybody.
