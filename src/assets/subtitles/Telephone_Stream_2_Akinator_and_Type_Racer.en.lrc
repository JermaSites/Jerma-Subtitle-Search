[00:52.29]Hey!
[00:55.74]Oh, boy.
[00:56.38]Hold on.
[00:57.18]Are we dropping frames?
[01:02.10]Give me a fucking break.
[01:09.57]Wait, wait a second.
[01:10.35]Wait a second.
[01:10.97]Wait a second.
[01:11.55]How...
[01:21.49]Just wait.
[01:22.52]Wait, wait, wait.
[01:26.46]Hold on.
[01:26.78]Just keep watching the intro scream while I figure out how loud I'm going to scream.
[01:30.61]Just give me a minute.
[02:32.20]I don't know.
[02:35.06]Right when I press the button.
[02:39.10]Well, uh... Huh.
[02:43.07]That's... Hey!
[02:46.87]Welcome to the stream!
[02:47.71]Haven't seen you guys in a week!
[02:49.29]How you doing?
[02:50.19]I'm doing good.
[02:52.53]Just dropping 20% of all frames.
[02:55.16]That's how we like to start out streams.
[02:59.80]Um, I think we might be okay.
[03:04.25]It's going down now.
[03:05.45]Does everybody hold your breath?
[03:06.45]I think I'm okay.
[03:14.25]Nah, don't speak so soon.
[03:16.99]But anyways, while we have, let's just...
[03:19.75]Try to ride this out while I talk about PAX and everything.
[03:23.42]I'm back.
[03:24.90]It was fun.
[03:26.66]I've never been to PAX without a badge before, but you know what?
[03:28.98]It was pretty interesting.
[03:32.64]I was completely free.
[03:35.06]I wasn't held down to the notion that I had to go to the show floor and be allowed in.
[03:42.25]I could go wherever I wanted to in the lobby.
[03:48.12]um no it's still happening yeah I didn't have a badge at all I actually got a hold of one on uh on the Saturday somebody had an extra one and I just happened to grab it and went down there for like 30 minutes um we might run into a very very unfortunate situation here if this does not get better
[04:22.53]I can smell that Las Vegas air right now.
[04:28.57]Um, hold on.
[04:32.32]The last time this happened was... We had to really ride this out.
[04:37.10]For like 20 minutes or so.
[04:39.26]So, let me... Stolen badge?
[04:44.37]I didn't steal a badge, it was given to me.
[04:46.37]But, no, it was fun.
[04:47.71]It was a good weekend.
[04:51.29]A lot of people that I never really met before.
[04:55.09]I got to hang out with Vinny.
[04:56.67]Never saw Vinny before.
[04:59.03]In reality, as they say.
[05:02.28]He was a really swell dude.
[05:03.24]Criken as well, really swell dude.
[05:04.82]A few other people that were interesting to meet.
[05:10.52]Time for an adventure book.
[05:11.52]Well, I don't have any left, so it's not going to happen.
[05:18.12]God damn, this really sucks.
[05:20.24]I'm sorry, guys.
[05:24.78]I had a technician here, and like, I'm not even sure.
[05:27.84]Let me try something.
[05:28.73]Just hold tight.
[05:29.61]I'm gonna try another server.
[05:30.59]Just give me a minute.
[05:37.61]Fuck.
[05:39.01]This sucks.
[05:40.37]Why?
[05:42.85]I have it all set up, too.
[05:44.51]True crime is literally in the background right now.
[05:48.98]I've been looking forward to playing this game after the first one.
[05:54.66]Uh, I'll be right back.
[05:56.62]I'm gonna try this.
[06:07.98]Oh, that's so much worse.
[06:11.54]That is... I'm dropping almost 100% of my frames now.
[06:13.36]Oh god.
[06:22.91]Well, we had a good run.
[06:26.35]Now I'm dropping 75% of every frame.
[06:27.87]This is so...
[06:39.33]Irritating.
[06:40.95]Fun stream.
[06:41.63]Yeah, that was fun.
[06:42.59]I'm back after about five or six days of not streaming because I was at a convention.
[06:47.25]Hey, guys.
[06:48.67]See you later.
[06:49.17]Not sure what.
[06:51.03]Bye.
[06:53.41]I hate doing this, man.
[06:54.95]I hate doing this shit.
[07:00.23]Narrate the game?
[07:01.19]No.
[07:01.51]I'm not even going to... Here's what we're going to do.
[07:05.53]I don't even care what I look like right now.
[07:07.02]No, don't even look at that.
[07:07.72]Don't look at that screen.
[07:09.40]Don't look at that screen.
[07:16.54]Hey.
[07:21.99]How bad is this right now?
[07:24.31]Can you even like tell what the fuck I'm even saying?
[07:29.69]Maybe it's the location of my router.
[07:31.59]No, it's not.
[07:34.93]Here's the problem.
[07:35.67]The problem is
[07:38.15]I don't know.
[07:39.53]I don't know what the problem is.
[07:45.11]What am I gonna what am I gonna do about this?
[07:55.66]Well, um, tomorrow, hey, thanks for tuning in tomorrow.
[08:02.43]This is what happened because this, not cool.
[08:06.73]Alright, let me break down a few things for you because this is obviously not gonna be fun to do this for the next like three hours.
[08:15.45]I'm gonna actually turn off the video because I think I'm wasting bandwidth.
[08:18.53]I'm using too much bandwidth.
[08:24.84]I'm on McDonald's internet.
[08:29.26]I think we're gonna just have to do a telephone stream.
[08:31.92]I think so.
[08:33.54]Unfortunately, I'm sorry guys.
[08:35.20]There's not much else I can do about this.
[08:36.74]We're gonna have to go over the straight up telephone stream.
[08:42.02]Hold on.
[08:44.84]Sometimes we do this because sometimes we have to.
[08:46.58]Do I have a bandwidth limit?
[08:47.58]No.
[08:50.47]Hold on.
[08:58.41]This is not even IRL.
[09:01.84]You know what I'm saying?
[09:03.18]I can't even make this IRL.
[09:05.46]What am I supposed to do about this?
[09:06.68]Like talk show?
[09:16.23]Telephone stream in real life.
[09:17.79]Hold on.
[09:18.92]How do I classify this?
[09:22.08]What a pain in the ass.
[09:25.18]I'm sorry.
[09:25.70]If you came here and you wanted to see actual crime, I'm sorry, but you're going to have to wait until another time because I have a personal couple matters to take care of on Thursday and Friday.
[09:39.23]I'm actually going to awaken a funeral.
[09:41.31]So I'm not going to be streaming on Thursday and Friday.
[09:43.67]I was going to make sure everyone was aware of that.
[09:46.19]But now, hey, look at this.
[09:47.68]Ain't this fun?
[09:48.40]I'm probably only going to be able to stream tomorrow.
[09:51.76]I've got to figure out what the fuck is going on here.
[09:55.45]but I'm not going to be live on Thursday or Friday.
[10:01.83]Talk about signing that guy's face.
[10:04.09]Yeah, I hope that came off.
[10:06.37]I did sign a guy's face at PAX.
[10:15.58]So the plan is probably going to be... Tomorrow, Criken...
[10:21.35]and crew uh we're gonna play sub Rosa so there was a lot of people liked and thought the Criken intruder fun friend stream was uh fun and interesting so we're gonna do it again this time we're gonna do it on sub Rosa and that's tomorrow night so jot that down in your calendar
[10:43.45]So Wednesday, probably Saturday, Sunday or Wednesday, Sunday, Monday.
[10:48.83]Is it going to be the jumbled around schedule this week?
[10:55.24]I'm going to have to like somebody made the joke.
[10:57.80]I probably am going to have to bring a laptop to McDonald's and use their Internet.
[11:04.57]Because this is not good.
[11:06.11]This ain't good.
[11:07.25]This ain't good, as they say.
[11:12.86]Time for a comb stream.
[11:13.80]I can't even do a comb stream.
[11:15.02]I'm dropping 70% of every frame.
[11:17.02]I can't.
[11:19.78]This has to be a telephone stream.
[11:26.17]I should just do like McDonald's food reviews or something.
[11:32.21]Will that work?
[11:33.91]Will you guys be alright with that?
[11:36.39]What if I review all the McDonald's menu items?
[11:42.87]That'd be so stupid.
[11:44.76]You know what's funny?
[11:45.78]I make that as a joke, but there are probably channels on Twitch and on YouTube that have already done that.
[11:52.74]I guarantee you there's some YouTube channel whose sole purpose is to review all the McDonald's menu items.
[11:58.97]So I'm late to the party there.
[12:01.91]Now I have to do it.
[12:05.03]God.
[12:07.93]Do it, do it.
[12:10.67]I need to change this from... Because this says I'm playing a video game, and that's not real.
[12:16.71]Telephone.
[12:17.39]Audio only shit stream.
[12:20.93]Can you swear in titles?
[12:25.88]Audio only till my internet goes down.
[12:27.92]Like, honestly.
[12:29.36]I don't even know why this is happening.
[12:33.20]What is this?
[12:33.82]Not IRL.
[12:34.54]Like, podcast.
[12:36.08]No, this is not even a podcast, though.
[12:38.82]Talk show?
[12:39.35]Talk show?
[12:42.20]No, this is not a talk show.
[12:45.68]It's not IRL either.
[12:47.64]God damn it.
[12:48.36]Why can't there be like a void?
[12:50.12]Is there a void?
[12:51.30]I need a void category.
[12:55.95]Alright, here we go.
[13:01.61]Void.
[13:02.53]Zero viewers.
[13:03.55]I'm just in the void right now.
[13:08.94]Because this is not a talk show.
[13:10.02]And there's like people doing running talk shows right now.
[13:15.86]We're just in the void.
[13:19.78]Anyways, um... Hey!
[13:23.14]So what are your questions?
[13:24.52]Anybody got any questions for me?
[13:25.98]You know?
[13:26.60]Tuber?
[13:27.26]Streamer?
[13:28.49]What have you always wanted to know?
[13:30.19]I'll take anything.
[13:31.19]What do you got?
[13:34.65]The void is actually a good game.
[13:39.17]Is it really?
[13:50.03]Spend money on a hotspot.
[13:51.83]Actually, it's funny you say that.
[13:53.92]I actually am going to get, because we have a lot of on-location streams planned over the next few months.
[14:01.28]So I'm going to get one of those hockey pucks.
[14:04.38]One of those Verizon hotspot hockey pucks.
[14:07.04]So that is a good idea.
[14:09.72]And guess what?
[14:10.26]I might even have to use the damn thing for regular streams, apparently.
[14:14.85]You have $20.
[14:15.49]What game should you buy?
[14:16.53]You should buy Hollow Knight.
[14:18.19]Then you'll have $6 to go to McDonald's and get a McChicken sandwich.
[14:23.46]And fries.
[14:24.58]One of my favorite menu items.
[14:25.64]You'll see the review soon.
[14:31.56]I guess we can read some bits and just hang out for a little... You guys know I hate this, right?
[14:39.15]I want to make sure everyone's aware of this.
[14:41.41]I wanted to do shit tonight.
[14:46.08]Just in case you're wondering, I was ready to go.
[14:50.00]$6 for a McChicken?
[14:53.64]Yeah, a meal with fries and a drink.
[14:58.72]Did I watch the Masters?
[15:03.16]No.
[15:06.14]I did not.
[15:08.68]Am I going to stream Kingdom Hearts?
[15:10.53]I don't know, maybe.
[15:12.56]Those are long games though.
[15:13.90]Kingdom Hearts.
[15:14.48]Kingdom Hearts 1, 2, 3.
[15:16.08]When 3 comes out.
[15:17.78]Those are 100 hour games.
[15:20.24]I'm not sure that I have the patience to stream a 100 plus hour game on stream.
[15:28.39]How many McDonald's fish sandwiches can I eat in one sitting?
[15:31.35]Zero because I don't like them.
[15:33.62]Now, I'll make chicken sandwich.
[15:35.14]Here you go.
[15:36.18]If you gave me, first of all, you locked me in a room and all you gave me was small glasses of water and with vitamin tablets in it.
[15:46.41]So I'm like locked in a cell and you just put it here.
[15:48.91]Here you go.
[15:49.27]Here's your water and your vitamin tablets.
[15:52.63]So I would be still I would stay alive.
[15:54.59]I mean, so you give me enough nutrients, but I'm really hungry.
[15:59.46]And after like three or four days of vitamin tablets, you open the door and you put a bag over my head and you're like, put me in a car and you drive, drive, drive, get them there quick.
[16:12.04]And the driver's like driving really fast to McDonald's.
[16:16.11]And well, I don't know that because obviously there's a bag on my head.
[16:18.87]So we get to the, we stop slowly and all of a sudden you hear like, McDonald's, where can I get you?
[16:26.48]And he's like, he turns towards me and he's like, oh, what do you want?
[16:30.80]This is, what would you like for McDonald's?
[16:33.40]I'm going to be like, give me chicken McChicken, McChicken sandwiches, as many as you can fit in the bag.
[16:39.40]I think in that scenario, I could probably eat, I would probably eat seven, right?
[16:44.90]I'm not going to say, oh, I could probably eat 15.
[16:46.45]I could probably eat seven McChicken sandwiches if I was like starving on vitamin tablets, you know?
[16:54.62]I would get, I guess everybody says, oh, I'm so hungry.
[16:56.88]I'm so hungry.
[16:57.28]But once you eat like three or four McChickens, you're going to get full.
[17:06.06]Just scream for help?
[17:08.48]Well, no, because after you eat the McChickens, and the guy's like, alright, back to the cell with you, and he starts to turn the car around, that's when you do the shoulder at the same time that you open the hatch.
[17:19.44]So you shoulder hatch, roll, and then I'm going to be running around with a bag on my head just screaming.
[17:25.08]You know what I mean?
[17:26.07]I want to get the food first.
[17:28.21]That guy's paying for it.
[17:28.99]I don't have any money.
[17:30.33]I've been locked in a cell for like three days.
[17:37.85]Your stomach shrinks after not... Wait, yeah, but I would just... Sorry, let's rephrase that.
[17:44.71]So they're feeding me water, vitamin tablets, and a bunch of lettuce.
[17:50.70]Once or twice a day.
[17:56.88]How do you eat with a bag on your head?
[17:58.62]I could pull it up.
[17:59.70]I could reach... Look, the stream is like dying right now, but I could just go like this.
[18:05.59]Like, you know what I'm saying?
[18:06.53]I can just pull it up like that and like eat like this.
[18:09.66]15,000 drop frames.
[18:17.66]Oh my God.
[18:20.32]This might be the most drop rates I've ever had.
[18:30.95]What is wrong with me?
[18:31.71]What are you talking about?
[18:36.13]Facecam stream.
[18:37.15]I would turn the facecam on, but I want to save as much bandwidth as I can.
[18:40.86]Alright, let's read some bits while I have a minute.
[18:50.66]Thank you to Manboy for the 30 cents.
[18:52.36]Vodboys.
[18:53.08]Well, I don't know how long the Vodboys are going to be able to watch this.
[18:57.04]We're going to try to ride this out.
[19:00.58]Yeah, I have like five times more dropped frames than viewers.
[19:06.76]It's a good thing your voice doesn't have frames.
[19:11.41]Why would you remove the bag and then put it back on?
[19:14.77]Well, because, alright.
[19:15.53]So like, if I look, do I have like a, hold on.
[19:19.27]I'm going to show you guys.
[19:20.25]Look here.
[19:23.83]No, that's not like, that doesn't constitute a bag.
[19:26.71]Do I have any bags down here?
[19:27.91]No, I'm not going to put a bag on my head on stream.
[19:31.71]That's like dangerous.
[19:33.59]No, it's not.
[19:35.12]Yes, it is.
[19:35.58]Don't do that.
[19:39.48]I don't have a bag down here.
[19:40.82]I was going to show you guys.
[19:42.38]I need a breathable piece of cloth to show this to you, but I don't have one.
[19:48.35]I'm going to put a plastic bag on my head on stream.
[19:51.28]I will get banned in 30 minutes.
[19:59.19]Tell me it was smooth.
[20:00.29]I can look over here right now and see exactly what, uh, when the frames are dropping and it looks pretty good right now.
[20:09.58]It looks good right now, but every like two or three minutes, this drops down to red and I dropped that.
[20:15.68]Here we go.
[20:16.04]So for instance, like I'm going to move around like fucking crazy.
[20:18.38]What'd you see all these frames?
[20:22.46]You definitely didn't see them all.
[20:26.25]It just went down to like orange.
[20:30.67]I'll do it again.
[20:38.90]I'm actually curious about this.
[20:42.34]It was fine, but what went down to orange?
[20:49.33]You definitely aren't seeing all these!
[20:51.73]No way!
[20:53.21]Because it's red!
[20:54.05]I can see the frames dropping!
[20:59.37]It's bright red on my screen.
[21:05.08]Play the game.
[21:05.84]I can't play the game.
[21:07.72]I'm so sorry.
[21:08.62]Everyone that's coming here right now is probably like, fucking, this guy sucks.
[21:12.76]I don't want to see another telephone stream.
[21:14.86]It's been six days, Jeremy.
[21:19.36]What's like the fastest thing in the world?
[21:20.88]I know, me.
[21:21.66]Watch this.
[21:22.32]I'll show you.
[21:22.88]You want to see dropping frames?
[21:24.51]No, this is embarrassing.
[21:25.25]I'm not going to do like an embarrassing thing.
[21:26.75]I know that the frames are dropping because I'm watching them drop right now on OBS.
[21:31.81]It's smooth.
[21:32.65]There's no way this is smooth.
[21:36.13]There's no, look at, look at this.
[21:39.72]I can't even, hold on.
[21:40.52]Alright, let me show this one like.
[21:42.32]Alright, can you see this?
[21:46.29]Can you see the red?
[21:47.73]You're gonna see yourself here, hold on.
[21:54.10]You're gonna end up seeing yourself, but you're gonna see what I see.
[21:58.54]This is like behind the scenes, you know what I'm saying?
[22:02.28]Take a look at this.
[22:07.94]Look at it.
[22:10.00]Do you see that?
[22:11.44]See that fucking orange and the red?
[22:14.71]That's telling me to turn the stream off.
[22:16.61]That says, turn the stream off.
[22:20.88]And let's go over here.
[22:22.88]Oh, fuck.
[22:25.20]Look at these dropped frames.
[22:28.76]You see that?
[22:29.22]17,000.
[22:36.24]It's not focusing, but it's real.
[22:37.54]Look at, watch, watch real time.
[22:41.32]Those are, those are dropped frames.
[22:53.95]New tab.
[22:55.91]No, I need that in case I need to look up a fucking YouTube video.
[23:03.18]This is such a crock of shit, I'll tell you.
[23:10.92]Try the game.
[23:11.87]That's not going to happen.
[23:13.57]I don't want to start the game.
[23:14.71]Because I've been looking forward to playing this.
[23:16.77]Because we played the whole last one.

[35:30.84]But I didn't submit this.
[35:33.23]Why does it say submitted by me?
[35:35.75]I didn't submit this photo.
[35:38.07]Somebody else did.
[35:46.20]Jesus Christ.
[35:50.46]Well, there it is, guys.
[35:51.46]I did it.
[35:52.53]I played Akinator on stream.
[36:02.66]No, this is just like the old 20 questions ball where you flip it around and you look at it and you ask it questions and it can get like, oh, chair.
[36:11.90]What's one that they will never get?
[36:14.28]I did not submit this.
[36:15.44]I don't even, this is website.
[36:16.90]That's the first time I've ever been on this website.

[36:34.81]What?
[36:37.45]Um, Captain Crunch, okay?
[36:39.11]Captain Crunch.
[36:40.61]Is your character a girl?
[36:41.63]No.
[36:42.33]It's not gonna get Captain Crunch.
[36:44.47]This is only to, like, boost the egos of streamers and YouTubers.
[36:48.20]That's why it's the second fucking question.
[36:51.88]You know, you understand?
[36:54.16]If you have a YouTube channel, or if you have a Twitch stream, you've done this.
[36:58.61]And you're like, wow, is it gonna get me?
[37:00.31]It got me!
[37:01.03]Whoa, crazy, dudes!
[37:02.87]Like, it's only for YouTubers to pretend to be cool.
[37:05.76]That's all this is for.
[37:08.42]It's not gonna get Captain Crunch, because Captain Crunch is not a fucking YouTuber, so... Does your character really exist?
[37:13.32]No.
[37:19.84]Does your character have human skin?
[37:21.74]Uh, yes.
[37:24.68]Is your character from a TV series?

[37:30.00]Uh, Captain Crunch has never been in a movie.
[37:31.67]No.
[37:35.85]Does your character use guns?
[37:38.11]No.
[37:39.19]Yeah, and I did it, so that's what I'm saying.
[37:42.43]Does he have a mustache?
[37:43.28]Yes, he does.
[37:46.84]No, he's not a genie.
[37:48.24]Oh, you mentioned me, Akinator?
[37:50.02]Ah, you thought you could fool me.
[37:51.32]Not linked with Nintendo, no.
[37:54.34]Not originally from a video game.
[37:58.32]Does he wear a hat?
[37:59.12]Yes, he does.
[38:02.19]Not from a... See, it's all like video games.
[38:06.35]Is he a character of white hair?
[38:07.49]Yes.
[38:07.61]Yes, he is.
[38:23.27]It's never gonna... Oh, come on, man.
[38:27.22]Dude, I'm so late to the party here.
[38:29.06]This is like 2012 YouTube.
[38:35.04]It's not gonna get Glue Man.
[38:36.14]Glue Man is like an obscure character from my channel.
[38:42.05]Yes, let's do Glue Man.
[38:44.95]Is your character real?
[38:45.69]No.
[38:49.55]Human skin.
[38:50.88]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[38:53.51]I don't know.
[38:54.97]That's a tough one because I don't know.
[38:57.51]Because is that human skin or is that fucking glue?
[39:00.11]Is your character evil?
[39:03.05]No.
[39:06.76]Is your character originally from a video game?
[39:09.40]Technically, probably.
[39:11.04]Is your character a genie?
[39:15.98]No.
[39:19.38]How would you even get glue, man?
[39:20.44]And half these questions are unanswerable.
[39:26.38]Does his character have an owl as a representation?
[39:28.76]No.
[39:32.96]Yes, he's a superhero.
[39:40.12]Is your character green?
[39:41.38]No.
[39:44.80]Does he wear a mask?
[39:45.76]No, he does not.
[39:48.43]Are you in a relationship with your character?
[39:51.63]No.
[39:53.33]Why would it ask that?
[39:55.73]Okay, for a second I thought this is... I looked over at my other monitor.
[39:59.13]I thought this is, does your character have a robotic penis?
[40:02.90]No.
[40:03.48]And the answer still would have been no.
[40:05.74]Did you see where it's cape?
[40:09.32]Has your character played Superman?
[40:10.92]No.
[40:13.44]Is your character black haired?
[40:14.68]No.
[40:21.42]I am seriously fucked up right now.
[40:24.25]What is wrong with me?
[40:24.99]Does your character have an anus?
[40:26.89]I don't know why this is happening to me.
[40:28.95]It's all I can see.
[40:31.73]What's going on right now?
[40:33.53]Oh, by the way.
[40:34.85]By the way.
[40:35.99]Yes, he does have a secret identity.
[40:37.53]I had a dream and it's going to turn into a stream.
[40:40.61]No guard.
[40:44.73]I had a dream about a certain stream that I was doing and I'm going to do it now.
[40:52.52]Is your character from Log Horizon?
[40:54.18]I don't even know what the hell that is.
[40:57.38]No, the character's not fat.
[41:00.16]Oh, God damn it.
[41:05.04]How the fuck is this?
[41:06.84]How?
[41:09.74]It's just, I don't understand how that would know that.
[41:12.58]It's just a compiling data.
[41:19.72]Jesus Christ.
[41:20.52]Okay, well, we had fun with that.
[41:24.72]How's this frame look?
[41:26.14]How are we holding up here?
[41:33.38]Keep playing.
[41:34.90]Submitted by Glue Man.
[41:38.10]See?
[41:38.36]I told you I didn't do shit.
[41:41.01]You guys thought I was submitting my own material.
[41:50.65]The frames actually look pretty good right now.
[41:52.09]I'm not going to lie.
[41:53.98]It might be worth a shot.
[41:56.20]Hold on.
[41:59.74]Yeah, it might be worth a shot.
[42:01.78]I think we may have weathered the storm long enough to be able to do this.
[42:08.00]I think so.
[42:09.66]Hold on.
[42:10.13]Ultimate test.
[42:12.23]Get this off.
[42:31.34]Is it OBS?
[42:32.46]No, it's definitely not OBS.
[42:38.40]Speed test?
[42:38.90]Speed test looks fine.
[42:40.63]But it could be... That's not really a good par for what is real or not.
[42:49.11]Let me see what else I can do here.
[42:53.56]Do I have like a fucking... I think I bought a long time ago a dumb game on Steam where you make pizzas.
[42:59.69]Am I really going to play the red alert make the pizza game?
[43:03.97]Because that was a red alert game.
[43:08.49]What's installed here that is not going to take up a lot of frame data?
[43:11.45]I don't know.
[43:13.85]Let me see.
[43:20.32]Far Cry 5.
[43:22.60]That's not going to happen.
[43:27.58]Hmm.
[43:30.92]No.
[43:33.84]Fuck.
[43:34.00]I'm not going to play any more cool math games.
[43:41.69]Pizza.
[43:42.15]Alright.
[43:43.31]Where is it?
[43:43.85]I have it somewhere.
[43:47.31]Again, if you don't want to deal with this bullshit, I don't blame you at all.
[43:52.10]Hopefully, we'll figure it out tomorrow.
[43:55.48]But I don't think it's my internet, oddly enough.
[44:00.85]I'll try again tomorrow.
[44:04.74]Back to the telephone stream, I guess.
[44:15.59]There's a few, no, whatever.
[44:19.35]What's a game, I'm gonna just open up a browser game and just play it.
[44:23.13]What's the, I'm gonna type in most popular browser game.
[44:34.04]What the fuck is this the 40 best browser games in the world Alright, what are they Okay, we're gonna go all the way down to number one cuz that's all anybody cares about Rune scape
[45:01.44]I'm not going to play RuneScape right now.
[45:10.90]I think I might just turn this into, yeah.
[45:12.68]I don't want to just sit here with nothing happening.
[45:16.11]I'd rather just like take questions or do like a fucking on my face scream.
[45:31.28]Well, that's the way it's gonna be.
[45:37.46]Type racer versus viewers.
[45:38.90]I will lose that every time.
[45:48.42]I'm so sorry.
[45:49.14]I'm just like immensely frustrated right now.
[45:53.32]If the stream wasn't on, if this camera wasn't on,
[45:56.99]I would be sitting here just swollen.
[45:59.63]I would be just, I would be swollen.
[46:03.41]And there would be fucking steam coming off my body.
[46:06.43]I would be saying every horrible thing you've ever heard in your life.
[46:10.43]I would be cursing out every single thing I could, even if it wasn't even a real object.
[46:15.55]I would be cursing out ghosts and shit if the stream wasn't on.
[46:22.26]Why did I put these on?
[46:23.54]I'm just like, I'm just like doing things to do them right now.
[46:29.34]I'm trying to contain my anger.
[46:31.58]And I'm getting red.
[46:34.38]Alright.
[46:37.64]Let's do this.
[46:45.32]I'm with Comcast.
[46:47.69]And there's nothing I can do about it unless I move.
[46:51.61]What's wrong with my eye?
[46:53.21]What happened to my eye?
[46:55.11]What's on my eye?
[46:55.69]What?
[46:57.27]Something on my eye?
[47:00.47]What is it?
[47:04.33]You notice that you do that?
[47:05.29]You notice that?
[47:06.73]Anytime that somebody is doing something where they're touching their eye, they're looking down, they always go like this.
[47:11.70]Every time.
[47:12.10]I think we already did this, but I'm doing it again.
[47:14.88]Old fucking material.
[47:15.72]Who cares?
[47:16.82]You like, why do people do that?
[47:18.98]Like when you look down, like let's say I was looking at something and I was really concentrating.
[47:24.13]Or like,
[47:26.05]Why is this happening?
[47:27.71]Why are you doing that?
[47:29.27]I don't understand why we do that.
[47:32.22]It's like concentrating makes your face turn into a scowl.
[47:37.70]Find all the Monster Rancher 3 monsters.
[47:41.30]Not with 1100 up right now.
[47:49.41]Type Bracer.
[47:50.03]Hold on a minute.
[47:51.49]How does Type Bracer even work?
[47:56.72]Type Racer.
[47:58.22]Play it around people, around the world.
[48:03.94]I'm just, it's going to be embarrassing for me.
[48:09.76]Hold on.
[48:10.06]Wait, wait, wait.
[48:10.39]Get ready to start.
[48:11.09]I'm not ready.
[48:15.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:16.79]Shit.
[48:17.09]Go back.
[48:24.91]You got me to play Type Racer?
[48:26.63]I mean, you did.
[48:29.12]Even my facecam's lagging.
[48:30.36]I know, that's what I'm saying.
[48:31.44]It's just, it's so fucking irritating.
[48:35.46]I might actually contact Twitch.
[48:37.96]I think that's the next step here because I don't think it's my internet.
[48:40.95]I really don't.
[48:43.85]I'm going to contact my guy at Twitch.
[48:49.96]and just be like hey um can you like look at my ingest into these eastern servers and see if there's somebody like grabbing the cord and turning it like this it's not just me are other people from the east coast having problems maybe it's just the way that we're being some of us are being routed into Twitch's servers
[49:19.40]I don't know.
[49:19.98]Call Twitch on stream.
[49:22.02]Twitch does not have a phone number that you can call.
[49:24.28]I'm not sure you're aware of this.
[49:30.10]Make a typewriter game that we can all join.
[49:32.09]I'll do that.
[49:32.47]And then I'm going to get going.
[49:35.03]This is just frustrating and bad content.
[49:41.71]If I'm like honest, like this is just like, hey, look, my stream doesn't work.
[49:46.57]Let's sit here and waste your time.
[49:52.54]It was Mark Zuckerberg.
[50:01.37]Call Twitch.
[50:02.05]No, I got a guy that I know at Twitch that I can DM.
[50:09.84]But I'm sorry again, everybody.
[50:10.88]That's really all I can say at this point.
[50:13.90]So I'm going to play Type Racer against everybody, and then I'm going to Rage to end the stream.
[50:19.20]And I'm going to click that stop streaming button really angrily.
[50:22.68]It's going to be like... Alright, so type racer.
[50:27.55]Let me get that in a different window.
[50:36.41]Like this.
[50:36.93]Hold on.
[50:37.31]You're going to stare at my fucking face for a minute here while I figure this out.
[50:42.36]Okay.
[50:43.18]Race your friends.
[50:44.00]Okay.
[50:46.32]Okay.
[50:49.59]How the hell does this work?
[50:53.39]I guess we're here.
[50:54.07]I have a link.
[50:58.41]We're going to DDoS this whole server, though.
[51:02.39]Right?
[51:08.33]We're going to DDoS this server if I be like, here, take this.
[51:10.73]Alright, well, good luck.
[51:19.57]Here's my Type Racer match.
[51:23.66]Hopefully I don't break the game.
[51:25.72]Oh my god.
