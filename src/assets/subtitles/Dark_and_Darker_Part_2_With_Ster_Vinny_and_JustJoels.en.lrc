[ve:60.16.100]

[00:23.17]Yeah, a little early.
[00:24.45]How are you?
[00:26.73]What's happening?
[00:32.97]Uh, could you guess what we're doing today?
[00:34.96]Do I really need to tell you about my new obsession?
[00:40.54]This is one of the reasons why I was afraid of this game.
[00:45.08]One of the reasons why I didn't want to play it.
[00:49.63]It's because I know if I actually liked it,
[00:56.65]then it was going away in like four days and then it's gonna be oh I well I'm just gonna hop on dark and darker and it's just gone oh who knows how long until maybe like middle of the year or something it's not coming back dude yes it is
[01:25.22]Yeah, so here's the plan tonight.
[01:27.74]There are a lot of people that want to play.
[01:33.27]And last time I played almost completely and totally by myself.
[01:37.41]I was just alone almost the whole time.
[01:39.55]So tonight, there's a lot of people that are streaming right now that I probably am going to be hopping around different groups with.
[01:50.41]So the one that's set in stone, the one that is set in stone is Stir and Vinny at six o'clock.
[02:02.17]Now hold on a minute here.
[02:03.37]I'm very aware of the Metroid news.
[02:06.13]So I told Vinny, I was like, hey, I know you want to play that shit.
[02:10.94]So don't worry about like, oh, I said I was going to play.
[02:14.26]No, no, it's all good.
[02:16.60]So we're going to be kind of cycling people in and out.
[02:18.84]I know there's some other streamers that have wanted to play it.
[02:24.38]I don't know how long Stir wants to play for, but that's the plan.
[02:30.78]Did you end up giving that guy's items back?
[02:33.10]No, I didn't.
[02:33.94]I don't think I could.
[02:37.94]The only thing that makes me not feel bad about that is the fact that everything's getting wiped in like four days.
[02:42.33]Right?
[02:42.73]It's okay.
[02:45.83]Guilt plagues him.
[02:47.03]No, I'm fine.
[02:49.93]I told you, I put it down in a corner of my inventory.
[02:53.30]To be a constant reminder.
[02:54.30]Of my sin.
[03:02.73]But I'm going to give you a small warning.
[03:07.06]Small warning.
[03:09.30]This is going to go a long time.
[03:12.80]This stream is I'm just going to play it until I don't feel like until I don't feel like playing it anymore.
[03:19.89]This stream could go all the way through to like potentially early into the morning hours.
[03:26.38]I just want to play it.
[03:27.96]Same kind of idea as before.
[03:30.23]Just kind of chill out and just go.
[03:32.63]And have fun.
[03:34.03]Whatever that means.
[03:37.41]I don't think this is going to be a 14 hour stream.
[03:39.01]But don't be surprised if it's like 8 to 10.
[03:43.03]I'm going to get up.
[03:44.37]I promise.
[03:44.91]I've already eaten dinner.
[03:46.25]I prepared for this day.
[03:48.79]I've got a nice green tea, like a nice full hydrating green tea drink.
[03:53.73]Drank a bunch of water.
[03:54.73]Full dinner.
[03:55.45]Pasta.
[03:56.23]Carbed.
[03:56.73]I'm carved up.
[04:05.60]Yeah, so me, Stir, and Vinny in like 30 minutes.
[04:11.42]And then from there, we'll see.
[04:14.38]There's a lot of other people that are probably going to be just jumping in and out.
[04:19.68]I'll warm up a little.
[04:20.34]I don't want to be a terrible player when, you know, friends want to play.
[04:30.49]There's three people.
[04:31.21]The title needs to be Dumb, Dumber, and Dumbest.
[04:34.63]Yeah, I made it the Dumb and Dumber sequel title.
[04:38.31]Dumb, Dumber, and Dumbest.
[04:39.81]No, I don't want to have it that because everyone will just call me the dumbest one.
[04:44.31]If it's dumb, dumber, and dumbest, I have to be the dumbest one, no matter who it is.
[04:51.34]Of all the streamers I'll be playing with, I'll always be dumbest in quotes.
[04:55.04]And I don't like that.
[04:56.26]I'm not into that one.
[04:57.40]I'm not a fan of that.
[05:03.14]It could be me, stir, and orangutan.
[05:07.68]And you would probably have the orangutan be smarter than me.
[05:11.13]Like, oh yeah, the orangutan is smarter than you, Trevor.
[05:27.08]What'd you say?
[05:29.86]The orangutan would be the smartest.
[05:33.08]I'll give you a little bit of insight into a stream that happened.
[05:36.85]The replace me stream.
[05:39.21]I wanted to have one of the contestants be an orangutan.
[05:43.85]Like just kind of walk into the room and like put the headset on and like play dark souls kind of good.
[05:50.50]And it was like, Oh wow.
[05:51.42]Okay.
[05:52.46]Interesting stuff.
[05:54.40]It was just going to be a real orangutan that was a contestant.
[05:59.83]But again, some ideas just don't work and they can't happen.
[06:07.45]Because, like, I was like, oh, wouldn't it be kind of fun?
[06:09.17]Because, like, obviously, I wanted to be, like, okay, like, how do you, like, want to make sure it's done correctly?
[06:13.71]Like, you know, some animals that are in movies and TV shows, I would want to have, like, a real, a legit setup where it's, you know, the trainer, and it's, like, an orangutan that was, like, knew how to do this stuff or used to it, and it was, like, no, like, animal cruelty bullshit, right?
[06:28.47]I wanted to do it right and do it, like, safe and good, even if we had to shoot it separately or something, right?
[06:34.52]But it was just too much of a hassle.
[06:37.86]So I was like, never mind.
[06:38.84]It's not worth it.
[06:47.48]But can you imagine just like, oh, like, okay, like number 10, come on in.
[06:51.79]And it's just like an orangutan just gets up and like sits in the chair and just like puts my headset on, just like hanging out.
[06:57.47]Like, oh, so what do you do?
[06:59.05]Interesting.
[07:00.33]We kind of look alike.
[07:00.93]It's gonna be like a whole little bit.
[07:02.69]And I was like, nah.
[07:04.05]Eh.
[07:06.46]The more you look into that stuff, you're just like, eh, it's probably not.
[07:09.42]Eh, nah.
[07:10.80]It was funny up here for like 20 minutes, and then I just didn't write it down, and it was over.
[07:20.96]Rangatang would have swept the votes.
[07:25.99]It would have won by a landslide.
[07:30.23]Can you imagine just like an orangutan just sitting on the stage and it's just like, has it like 90%, it just has 90% of the votes.
[07:52.89]What is this?
[07:54.37]When you sing happy birthday to my kids, they aren't going to be born until I'm 30.
[08:00.75]But if you say no, they're gonna cry.
[08:02.31]That's so stupid.
[08:11.42]So what, you want to like clip me singing happy birthday?
[08:14.92]So then in, I don't know how many years that is from where you are now, but then have that to play for the, what?
[08:23.56]That's actually kind of funny to me.
[08:25.59]That, like, potentially 5, 10, whatever years in the future.
[08:30.47]Or even, like, 30 years in the future when they're, like, I don't know.
[08:34.11]Oh, it's, like, George's fucking 16th birthday.
[08:38.67]I don't know.
[08:39.11]Oh, and we got a germa to do a happy birthday for you.
[08:44.58]I'm not going to be relevant.
[08:46.44]I'm sorry to say, guys.
[08:47.82]People are going to be like, who is this?
[08:52.90]That would be so weird, though, because imagine, like, some of these, like, people that have been on, like, TV or, like, other, like, people in, you know, movies or TV shows.
[08:59.88]Because a lot of people use Twitch and YouTube as new TV.
[09:03.58]So 30, 40 years from now, that would be so weird.
[09:05.84]Imagine if it was just like, oh, oh, by the way, you know, Jeremy, happy 20th birthday.
[09:12.59]Oh, by the way, Elvis has something to say to you.
[09:16.36]Like, Elvis?
[09:17.24]What do you mean, Elvis?
[09:18.74]And it's Elvis.
[09:19.52]He's just like, uh-huh.
[09:20.44]Hey, hey, German.
[09:21.22]How you doing?
[09:21.74]Uh-huh.
[09:22.00]Happy birthday.
[09:23.36]I'm singing a happy birthday song for you.
[09:24.92]Be like, what the fuck is going on?
[09:28.12]No, I'm not comparing myself to Elvis.
[09:29.66]I'm just saying, like, it's that same world of... It's just weird.
[09:33.36]No, no, no.
[09:37.46]I'm not comparing myself to Elvis.
[09:44.16]What an ego.
[09:47.74]No.
[09:50.39]I get what you mean.
[09:51.09]Don't worry.
[09:51.53]Thank you, one chatter.
[09:53.39]I appreciate it.
[09:54.07]Thanks, one guy.
[10:01.95]Jeremiah, I think you're going to die on the toilet.
[10:05.26]That's fine.
[10:08.06]That just doesn't bother me.
[10:11.14]That's not a big deal to me.
[10:12.68]That's actually like... I don't know.
[10:15.30]To me, that's not really that bad of a place to go.
[10:19.22]Right?
[10:19.46]Like that's here.
[10:22.43]Uh, whatever.
[10:32.95]Do an Elvis impression again.
[10:33.87]That was wicked funny.
[10:34.95]No, see what you're doing is doing the reverse psychology thing where you thought it was a really bad impression and you were like cringing and laughing at it.
[10:41.68]And you want me to like do it again because you thought it was an embarrassment and you think it's funny that I embarrassed myself in front of 400,000, 500,000 people here.
[10:52.42]And now you want me to do it again, to do that again.
[10:54.50]I understand what you're doing.
[11:04.17]Alright, let's go.
[11:08.75]Remember, there's only 9,000 people here.
[11:10.59]What the fuck?
[11:12.15]No, there's 500!
[11:26.48]You guys are not taking into account the amount of insects that watch this stream.
[11:31.58]I got a very large demographic of ants and spiders.
[11:35.26]And each colony of ants, you know, there's like 200,000 ants in a colony.
[11:40.63]They're big fans.
[11:45.77]Because you're only thinking of the human audience, which is, I mean, come on.
[11:57.11]You're also forgetting about all the food that watches.
[11:59.45]All the, all the, you know, your dogs and cats that are in the room.
[12:02.91]Like, I have a, I think I have a pretty unbelievably large sandwich audience.
[12:08.16]And I, I think that there are probably, I probably have like a, one of the, I probably have a pretty large ham sandwich demographic.
[12:12.98]Probably like ice cream.
[12:19.42]It's probably like a, I probably have a very large ice cream audience.
[12:22.57]I have like all the ice cream that has been like in front of like, you know, the video while I'm streaming.
[12:29.51]So yeah, I can say I have a 500,000 concurrent view audience because you're forgetting the ants, the bugs, the dogs, the cats, the ice cream, the sandwiches, the soups.
[12:37.24]There's a lot of things and people to watch.
[12:39.26]All right, you guys ready?
[12:44.32]Stop stalling.
[12:45.18]I am stalling because I'm just warming up.
[12:49.63]I actually did not say the direct.
[12:52.15]Heard there was some interesting things in it though.
[13:05.66]Pikmin 4.
[13:07.65]We should watch it.
[13:09.31]No.
[13:11.03]I'll watch it later.
[13:21.46]Your jokes are minus two, old man.
[13:26.14]Hey.
[13:26.70]Hey.
[13:27.02]Who asked?
[13:28.88]Oh, shit.
[13:29.36]Your name is who asked.
[13:31.00]God damn it.
[13:33.87]God damn it.
[13:35.51]Okay, well, you can take the win on that one.
[13:38.39]That's fine.
[13:49.34]All right, I'm ready.
[13:51.00]I'm ready to play.
[13:53.14]I'm going to do a round or two.
[13:54.12]Maybe I'll probably get one round in before Dura's around.
[13:57.28]We're playing it by ear tonight because I'm going to be live pretty much all night.
[14:06.51]Okay.
[14:07.79]Uh, let's go.
[14:10.59]Y'all know Mead 1?
[14:11.47]Uh, I have a confession.
[14:19.54]Holly and I were playing.
[14:26.09]So, I have a few new things.
[14:31.67]Look at this shit.
[14:34.98]Holly and I killed a group of three, and one of them had this stuff.
[14:40.12]And I almost have enough to buy a fucking purple.
[14:47.03]I also have something else to say, too.
[14:48.99]Playing this game with another person is 100 times easier.
[14:55.97]Holly and I played probably 10 games, and we got out, I think, seven or eight times.
[15:02.56]It is so much more of like a ridiculous experience alone.
[15:07.56]I think I made it out five times in eight hours two nights ago.
[15:18.12]It's just the stress levels are so much lower when there's another person or another two people.
[15:26.39]But here's the stuff I got so we can go over it.
[15:28.40]Lots more money.
[15:30.28]I do want to do the high roller stuff today.
[15:32.14]Very concerned about it, but I want to try it.
[15:34.96]Got this candy.
[15:36.54]Take a look at this.
[15:37.92]Yep.
[15:38.84]I had that already, didn't I?
[15:43.15]I forgot to give this to Holly.
[15:46.40]No, whatever.
[15:48.02]I got this here.
[15:48.66]This is pretty cool.
[15:49.76]I'm going to warm up a little bit.
[15:51.26]This is all my gear.
[15:53.52]There's nothing down here.
[15:55.96]This is just extra space.
[15:57.99]You don't even have to look at it.
[16:00.03]It's extra stuff.
[16:02.65]You don't have to see it.
[16:05.69]Yeah, I think I have enough money to be able to do some of that stuff.
[16:11.24]Try High Roller with a group that knows what they're doing.
[16:19.50]Can we look at it?
[16:21.00]It's nothing.
[16:21.34]We saw it.
[16:22.91]Okay.
[16:26.73]I'm just going to go.
[16:27.45]Let's go.
[16:28.03]Wait.
[16:30.37]I don't want to bring anything.
[16:31.58]I just want to try to get through.
[16:33.93]They did a... They actually changed the Goblin Caves.
[16:36.95]For those of you that don't know.
[16:38.53]Goblin Caves got a pretty big nerf.
[16:40.53]In regards to how hard it's been.
[16:43.37]I believe that Goblin HP and Goblin Attack Power... Pretty much the whole thing was nerfed by like 10% across the board.
[16:49.31]They added another portal.
[16:53.15]So it used to be, I think, what?
[16:54.55]Two or three?
[16:55.15]I think it's two.
[16:55.77]Now it's three.
[16:56.49]So now it's like... I don't think it's... I think it's actually probably a little better.
[17:00.91]So they made it not as hard.
[17:04.49]And they added a portal.
[17:07.19]He's reading patch notes.
[17:08.27]Yeah, I like this game.
[17:14.31]They had to make it easier because they felt bad for you.
[17:18.30]I think you're underestimating... No, I think you're overestimating how much power I have playing this game.
[17:24.62]I don't... That's not accurate.
[17:30.02]But I'm going to hop in it.
[17:30.98]I mean, I'm just going to go without gear.
[17:32.86]Just go.
[17:40.53]Oh, by the way, if you didn't know... It's auto!
[17:48.88]Oh my god!
[17:51.06]Jesus!
[17:52.24]Stop that!
[17:57.68]That was awful!
[18:03.11]Probably get one in before we get started here.
[18:08.70]I thought you were going to play with Vinny.
[18:10.24]Yeah.
[18:10.38]In like 15 minutes.
[18:12.64]We set six o'clock and I don't want to, you know, I want to be like, okay, yeah, it's six.
[18:16.96]You guys ready?
[18:20.62]Why is it so loud?
[18:21.48]Why is it so loud?
[18:36.06]It's still kind of loud.
[18:37.28]Is that better?
[18:39.55]That's better, right?
[18:40.17]A little too quiet?
[18:45.52]I'll deal with this now.
[18:55.14]Oh!
[18:59.40]I... I... I... You know, this one doesn't count.
[19:05.04]What's my... Why is my name so weird?
[19:07.64]What?
[19:08.08]Fighter 2?
[19:08.70]Oh, what is that?
[19:11.52]Oh, I have streamer mode turned on.
[19:13.38]I actually prefer streamer mode off.
[19:19.77]Alright, let's try it again.
[19:22.77]The game was really loud.
[19:23.47]I had to fix it.
[19:37.30]Good job, streamer.
[19:46.12]It's my job to defend auto in every pre-game.
[19:57.61]Sure you want to do high roller?
[19:58.89]I want to do high roller with a group of three.
[20:01.93]And a group of three that kind of plays and knows what they're doing.
[20:05.65]It's a hundred bucks every time.
[20:09.52]Alright, let's go.
[20:10.26]First real game of the night.
[20:12.34]By the way, I'm going to be obsessed.
[20:15.50]And I'm going to be here pretty much all night.
[20:17.01]So those of you that are like, oh, it's like 2am, Jerma.
[20:19.37]Oh, I'm staying.
[20:21.57]We'll see.
[20:29.37]What?
[20:29.65]I was holding right click.
[20:30.33]What happened?
[20:31.79]No, that's not right.
[20:33.59]That was weird.
[20:34.17]I was holding right click and it didn't do anything.
[20:42.08]I swear to God, I held it.
[20:42.90]Because it didn't do it.
[21:03.92]Nice.
[21:04.22]Alright, just gotta, you gotta, I gotta get in the swing of things.
[21:13.87]I already got that.
[21:20.61]Jeremy, you've been playing this game non-stop for two days.
[21:23.17]Please bathe.
[21:24.71]Ooh.
[21:29.64]Hey, dude, please bathe.
[21:33.10]I'm fine.
[21:45.19]Oh, fuck off.
[21:50.91]Oh, also, by the way, hey, look what I'm doing.
[21:53.67]I am running with everything holstered.
[21:57.45]That you still caught up to me.
[22:04.80]Oh, God damn it.
[22:09.36]I'm dead.
[22:26.14]God damn it.
[22:26.74]Just leave me alone.
[22:27.68]He's gonna... This one doesn't count.
[22:33.00]Like that, it's running into that guy.
[22:34.10]Okay.
[22:34.22]Alright, alright, alright.
[22:35.50]I'm fine, I'm fine.
[22:35.94]This one doesn't count.
[22:37.08]This is why you warm up.
[22:37.80]This is why I'm warming up.
[22:38.58]This is warm up shit.
[22:43.42]You open the door and like the boss skeleton is there.
[22:46.18]And he just follows me and kills me.
[22:48.01]This is why I warm up.
[22:50.27]Just, you know, just kill me.
[22:51.01]Kill me.
[22:51.23]Just do it.
[22:51.55]Just do it again.
[22:52.05]I'm warming up.
[22:52.65]So you gotta do three warm ups and that's it.
[22:54.05]I'm done.
[22:54.29]We're good.
[23:01.09]That was a shitty start too.
[23:02.47]I hit right click, I didn't raise the shield.
[23:05.99]You gotta get over these first.
[23:07.01]There's no such thing as a warm-up in this game.
[23:23.32]Well, there's enough for me to sit here and, like, kind of... You go through... Everybody goes through that process.
[23:28.93]I don't care if you've played, you know, Dark and Darker, League of Legends, Valorant, Apex, Overwatch.
[23:39.62]Your first two or three games are usually just dog shit.
[23:44.66]And then you're like, there you go.
[23:45.86]Then you're in.
[23:46.88]You're warmed up.
[23:48.74]So check out how this one goes compared to the last two.
[23:55.36]Pretty bad spawn.
[23:57.22]This is a really bad spawn.
[23:59.86]I kind of just get out of here.
[24:13.61]Yeah, I'm just getting out of here.
[24:20.40]Oh my God.
[24:33.47]Such a bad place to fight this.
[24:38.33]All right, something weird's happening.
[24:40.63]Sometimes... Okay, did you just hear me click?
[24:42.97]It didn't swing.
[24:44.37]What's going on here?
[24:45.35]This is actually weird.
[24:46.59]I swear to God.
[24:48.11]You had to have heard the click.
[24:52.96]What is going on?
[24:58.82]I hope that's not a problem.
[25:05.75]What the fuck is going on?
[25:07.27]Hold on.
[25:14.59]What?
[25:18.39]Yeah, I am like clicking and I'm left clicking and right clicking and sometimes it's just not happening.
[25:25.99]Should I restart the game?
[25:27.31]This wasn't happening yesterday.
[25:45.78]Is anybody else having that problem?
[25:47.28]Or is it just weird right now?
[26:04.19]Weird.
[26:05.19]Huh.
[26:14.95]I was playing earlier and it was swinging without me clicking.
[26:17.21]Hmm.
[26:33.06]Maybe it's an internet thing.
[26:34.47]Maybe like the connection to the game or something.
[26:39.49]I mean, as long as half of you believe this, then that's what matters, right?
[26:44.28]No, I'm like serious.
[26:45.08]It actually is happening.
[26:45.84]Okay, it's not happening anymore.
[27:14.86]That happened a couple times in a row that last game.
[27:37.84]Yeah.
[27:38.42]Now we're in.
[27:40.68]Now we're... Don't lose this one.
[27:44.86]Plus one weapon damage.
[27:46.86]Movement speed bonus.
[27:48.40]And it's a blue?
[27:49.70]This person wants to fight.
[28:01.47]And that's okay.
[28:09.53]I hear somebody else.
[28:23.44]Get over here.
[28:32.25]Are you two together?
[28:33.09]Oh, is that how it is?
[28:35.37]That's how it's gonna be, ain't it?
[28:37.09]That's how it is?
[28:39.75]Oh, okay.
[28:40.53]I'll take the bothy on.
[29:07.90]They were friendly?
[29:09.98]That was not friendly.
[29:10.90]That was very unfriendly.
[29:12.12]Hey, by the way, I'm not holding right click.
[29:15.62]See what's happening?
[29:17.59]Alright, something's weird today.
[29:22.29]Something's weird today.
[29:27.41]That was self-defense.
[29:28.82]Are you friendly?
[29:34.78]Come here.
[29:35.22]I'll give this to you.
[29:38.92]You good?

[29:52.42]Try that out.
[29:52.86]There you go.
[30:00.53]You can't use that?
[30:02.11]Close for me.
[30:03.79]Oh, you're nice.
[30:05.61]Um, here.
[30:06.07]How about you take...
[30:10.49]Here.
[30:10.78]Do you want a crown?
[30:12.40]See?
[30:12.72]Look, I'll try.
[30:13.40]I paid for that.

[30:39.87]No, what?
[30:53.70]That's cool hanging out.
[30:58.50]Alright, let's go together.
[31:13.67]That scared the shit out of me.
[31:27.40]Nice hit.
[31:28.46]Nice hit.
[31:31.74]Ooh.

[31:55.97]Yeah, yeah.
[31:59.15]Yeah.
[32:01.25]Look, we don't have to argue over who's going to pay the check.
[32:03.97]I'm telling you I got the check.
[32:05.37]Take it.
[32:06.53]My hand touched it first.
[32:10.87]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:14.47]All right, we got to get out of here alive though, so you can get, you know, you can get money for that.
[32:32.49]Yeah, good idea.
[32:33.37]Just get out of here.
[32:41.87]There it is.
[32:42.45]Alright.
[32:43.51]There's our escape.
[32:44.91]That's for you.
[32:45.55]No, you got a blue.
[32:46.84]You got a blue.
[32:47.58]No, you get out of here with that blue.
[32:48.56]I'm telling you right now.
[32:49.74]This is my warm-up round.
[32:50.54]You get out of here with that blue.
[32:56.62]Bro, you got a blue.
[32:57.44]You got a blue.
[32:58.26]You get out of here with that blue.
[33:08.25]There's two?
[33:08.69]Alright, let's get out.
[33:18.88]Is there one on top?
[33:22.00]Oh, there is.
[33:22.38]Alright, alright.
[33:23.62]There's one up there.
[33:24.16]Do you know how to get up there?

[34:07.26]Oh, I thought he knew how to get out.
[34:10.50]Oh, no!
[34:12.24]No, it's right there.
[34:12.74]It's right there.
[34:13.12]You'll be good.

[35:07.79]I got boots.
[35:09.65]I'm going to start a blue collection over here.
[35:12.48]I feel so bad.
[35:13.88]I thought he knew his way out.
[35:19.28]It should have been me.
[35:19.88]Yeah, it should have been me.
[35:21.42]I should have just dropped the boots for him and just died.
[35:29.04]Let's be real, though.
[35:29.78]That would have been pretty sick.
[35:31.95]If he had made that jump... Okay, let me get people on a call here.
[35:43.83]Uh-huh.
[35:44.39]Here we go.

[36:53.60]Is there any other cool things?
[36:57.40]There's a game where you play as a mouse, and you draw other mouses, and it's like you're a wizard.
[37:07.22]I'm lying.
[37:07.64]No, Zelda was there.
[37:08.60]I was going to say, that sounds cool.
[37:13.39]Get him out of here.
[37:14.81]What?
[37:15.93]Hey, Ster.
[37:16.79]Hey.

[37:24.39]Oh, good one.
[37:25.05]Yeah, it wasn't that.
[37:27.23]I tried my best, but you know what?
[37:28.75]It was fun.
[37:29.19]The Zelda trailer looked good, Jerma.
[37:31.20]So, you know.
[37:32.50]So, when I play, when I finish Breath of the Wild, I'm going to be able to go right into the new one, aren't I?
[37:36.92]Yep, you're going to have fun with it.
[37:39.08]That's pretty cool.
[37:39.74]All right, I just did, I had a successful run.
[37:45.90]Okay, I haven't installed the game.
[37:47.43]What's the, what are we playing?
[37:49.19]No, sir.
[37:52.11]You guys wait for me.
[37:52.93]Fucking three head.
[37:56.52]We're playing Darkest Dungeon.
[37:58.74]Right?
[37:59.36]Oh, I got that.
[38:01.28]Yeah, it's one of the two dark games that are available for the Steam Next Best.
[38:06.82]Dark and Darker.
[38:07.88]I just want to play it.
[38:10.08]I know they're going to take it offline and they're going to polish it up more.
[38:14.88]I want to play it.
[38:17.12]What class are you, Germ?
[38:19.20]I just did Fighter.
[38:22.41]Okay, I'll use my wizard then.
[38:24.89]I have a lot of random classes, but the only one that actually has gear or money is fighter.
[38:30.15]Okay.
[38:31.57]Yeah, I leveled a fighter.
[38:32.86]I have some stuff on a wizard.
[38:36.32]But yeah.
[38:38.40]If you want to invite me, my name is Vinesard.
[38:41.36]Like a wizard, but with vine.
[38:42.60]I couldn't think of a better name.
[38:46.52]My characters have like the number one next to them.
[38:49.44]I didn't even know what to do.
[38:53.37]Uh, what did you say was... Did you do Jerma 1?
[38:55.13]No, Mead 1.
[38:56.57]Oh, okay.
[38:57.97]I'm, uh, V-I-N-E-Z-A-R-D.
[39:00.39]Okay.
[39:03.17]There you are.
[39:03.57]Alright.
[39:05.93]Stir, what's your, uh, what's your name?
[39:09.08]I haven't made a character.
[39:11.50]What?
[39:11.70]Uh, what should I be?
[39:15.54]You... Didn't you tell me you played this?
[39:18.62]Yeah, I think they wiped, like, it was like four betas ago.
[39:20.86]Oh, oh, oh.
[39:21.56]The original beta.
[39:22.00]Oh.
[39:23.64]I told you, I also told you I have no levels and no gear and no nothing.
[39:27.11]That's fine.
[39:27.67]I didn't lie.
[39:28.41]But you, you just, you know, video games.
[39:30.23]So you're going to be, you're going to be fine.
[39:31.41]I know, I know video games.
[39:34.29]All right.
[39:34.55]So, um, I'm a fighter.
[39:36.45]We'll get you leveled up.
[39:38.45]Vinny, you have more experience than I do in this.
[39:40.38]Do we, like, I would say we probably need, like, we got a wizard.
[39:43.74]We have a fighter.
[39:44.36]I mean, you could be cleric.
[39:47.24]You're leveled, you're leveled pretty nicely.
[39:49.04]Uh, I would say I only played a lot last beta.
[39:52.52]Um,
[39:54.01]you know what ranger and cleric are two good choices I would say cleric is good for healing um but ranger is apparently really good with their like uh their arrows do a lot of dps so it's up to you stir whatever you like and um rogues can rogues still go invisible or whatever they did before they can okay I think uh
[40:18.73]if you played the first very first play tester there's I think there's actually a lot of new things in the game I didn't play very much I just played a little bit of uh cleric for like an hour uh I have like a couple things you probably could take just to have some stuff I mean you're not you're not getting my blues but you know
[40:43.06]Jerm, do you need a green rapier?
[40:46.44]I have a green spear, but can I even use rapiers?
[40:51.32]You can, yeah, fighter.
[40:52.42]Oh, wait, no, you can't.
[40:53.36]Rogue can, though, so I can give it to you, sir.
[40:56.90]I made a rogue.
[40:57.64]My name is CreepoMan.
[41:00.10]Okay.
[41:03.80]Wow.
[41:04.54]Like this?
[41:07.04]I wrote it in Discord.

[41:34.15]a weapon from my stash.
[41:35.59]I feel like you shouldn't give me anything yet.
[41:38.45]Yeah, let's just do a fuckface run.
[41:40.49]That's probably, yeah, take off all your good shit.
[41:42.15]Let's do a fuckface run.
[41:42.81]Just fucking raw dog my face on this one, because I didn't play very much when I played, and I only played cleric, and I kind of just healed.
[41:50.91]Why did you say it like that?
[41:52.41]What the fuck?
[41:55.06]Huh?
[41:56.44]I'll tell you what, I have a shitty rapier as well.
[41:58.72]I'll give you that one.
[42:00.86]Okay.
[42:02.95]Yeah, let's just go in without any... I mean... He's gonna die to the first skeleton, and he's gonna uninstall the game.
[42:11.62]Well, no, because I'm gonna stand on a box.
[42:14.90]Alright, you guys ready?
[42:17.34]Yeah, we're good.
[42:19.04]You, like, played this.
[42:19.88]You know kind of generally how it works.
[42:22.54]I I think it would honestly be in your best interest to assume that I don't okay I wait no I understand the gameplay everything outside of it like equipment and selling I don't that doesn't make any sense to me okay so but like basic information like how do I like basic information I might have to rebind keys I'm good dude you know I'm a gamer you're gonna be good you're gonna be good let's go I believe in you stir
[42:46.72]Yeah.
[42:47.30]Just a quick fuckface run.
[42:48.84]Yeah.
[42:49.38]Just like a dirty, nasty... It doesn't even matter what happens.
[42:53.31]Stank nasty... I got it.
[42:54.83]If anything goes bad, I'll just crouch in a corner.
[42:57.85]You'll be fine.
[42:58.25]Okay.
[42:58.79]Just ready up, though.
[43:03.08]Ow.
[43:03.18]Okay, I got it.
[43:06.02]No, Stir's a gamer.
[43:06.84]Stir will get it.
[43:07.60]Okay.
[43:09.52]I'm actually... You've been playing this a lot, huh?
[43:11.84]You got as addicted as I did.
[43:15.09]I'm one of those people that I'm very much already thinking that this is probably going to be the thing that I care about the most this whole year.
[43:22.72]Yeah, I feel that.
[43:23.86]I really like this game.
[43:26.80]Okay, I got to turn off the voice chat because they're saying... Isn't voice chat the best part of the game?
[43:36.01]It is until your Twitch channel gets banned.
[43:38.77]Oh, yeah.
[43:40.53]When you're... Okay, well, I'll get banned.
[43:42.47]I'll take the L.
[43:44.66]It could be fun.
[43:45.84]I gotta hear what they're saying.
[43:47.50]I already did a pre-record with voice chat on.
[43:50.82]I was able to convince people not to kill me.
[43:52.85]I was like, listen, dude, I'm a real person.
[43:55.39]Like, I'm real.
[43:56.65]And they left me alone.
[43:57.83]I did a little RP.
[44:00.35]It was fun.
[44:02.17]Here, you can have that rape here.
[44:03.91]It's good.
[44:04.82]You might like it.
[44:09.56]I'm in the options.
[44:10.78]Defend me.
[44:11.60]Okay.
[44:11.88]All right.
[44:13.02]It's good because this is a very slow game.
[44:15.00]So, like, it's not like, oh, dude, we got to go.
[44:16.78]Come on.
[44:17.00]The circle's closing in.
[44:19.54]Yeah.
[44:21.00]In the meantime, let's go look around.
[44:24.32]So, hey, quick TLDR.
[44:26.52]Stir everything.
[44:28.23]You should be picking up as many of these little jewels as possible.
[44:30.85]It's like one of the ways to make money.
[44:32.77]You want to collect everything.
[44:36.39]If it's like a little bracelet, a little jewel, a little goblin, that's how you actually make money.
[44:44.37]And then we bring it back and it's a socialist society and we all share, right?
[44:48.40]No, there's one guy that buys it all and runs the whole town.
[44:51.62]What's the inventory button?
[44:53.96]Tab.
[44:55.42]They didn't make it I. Do they not?
[44:59.38]Okay.
[45:03.93]Hang on, let me get this.
[45:06.48]There you go.
[45:06.92]Yeah.
[45:08.58]Spider.
[45:09.16]Spider.
[45:09.48]All right.
[45:12.77]There's another spider.
[45:14.01]There's a pod over there somewhere.
[45:16.25]Oh, my goodness gracious.
[45:17.75]Okay.
[45:18.21]I got a blue long sword.
[45:19.25]Watch out, Meade.
[45:22.15]I'm going to put that on.
[45:25.66]Remember, you can throw a torch on the ground if you need extra light and don't want to hold it.
[45:30.56]Okay.
[45:33.46]This thing's actually pretty awesome.
[45:34.74]I hope we make it out.
[45:38.14]Oh, oh, skeleton.
[45:43.69]Watch out.
[45:44.09]Magic was awesome in this game.
[45:46.11]Oh, you're not.
[45:48.35]You're not role playing.
[45:49.65]You're not like you don't say the spells when you cast them.
[45:52.23]Oh, should we?
[45:54.29]I can if you want me to.
[45:55.27]They gain more power.
[45:56.23]The game, if you have voice chat on and you say magic missile.
[45:58.96]Is this better than your hamster?
[46:02.43]The helmet?
[46:04.69]It's a leather cap.
[46:07.83]I don't know what items are.
[46:11.29]Diablo.
[46:12.19]When you're running around at level 1 in Diablo and every single thing you pick up on the ground is like, yeah, just replace it.
[46:16.58]It's better.
[46:17.32]Okay, I heard you should go nude because then you get more move speed.
[46:21.34]I mean, you could.
[46:22.70]I don't know if that's going to work, but we can try.
[46:26.24]Speaking of move speed, if you holster, you do move faster, so keep that in mind.
[46:30.00]What's the holster button?
[46:31.60]X. Guys.
[46:32.94]Okay, I need a moment to apologize because I'm going to be insufferable for like one or two games.
[46:38.86]You're just walking around naked.
[46:41.90]Why are you just a naked guy in our party?
[46:44.24]Hey, guys, is there any loot in there?
[46:45.55]I could really use some pants.
[46:47.21]I am not a conjurer of cheap tricks I just walked right out of a rust server you really do like you're like playing rust
[46:55.82]Oh, we got a skeleton here.
[46:56.84]I'm gonna punch him.
[46:58.86]He's gonna die.
[46:59.80]He's gonna fucking die.
[47:03.03]There is friendly fire stir and it's really bad, so just be aware.
[47:06.65]Okay.
[47:07.09]Well, you're the one who's taking the most damage, so I feel like you could use a little advice.
[47:11.19]Stir a better rapier here for you on the skeleton's corpse.
[47:14.01]Oh, yeah?
[47:14.40]And also germ my... Yeah, there you got that.
[47:16.94]Okay.
[47:18.00]If you guys want to give me 10 seconds to meditate so I can restore my magic, that would be awesome.
[47:22.28]Mm-hmm.
[47:23.69]Okay.
[47:24.45]Also, Stir, in the mini-map, you notice that the white line?
[47:26.85]Gotta get in that line, because you understand what happens.
[47:30.35]The... I don't under... It's like a VR.
[47:33.37]Like Battle Royale.
[47:34.03]Victory Royale is within... I've never played one of those.
[47:37.51]What happens?
[47:38.65]Essentially, when the thing... It comes... It goes around the circle, and if you're not in the other circle, watch out, because you're going to be taking tick damage.
[47:48.99]Yes, Stir, have you ever played a game called Fork Knife?
[47:52.29]uh so it's like hearthstone battlegrounds is it normal that your game should stutter all the time uh we haven't no but we have we have somebody over here we don't know if they're friendly it just looks like a single cleric my cat's saying yes
[48:12.39]Hey, Star, careful on the ground.
[48:14.29]Sometimes there's like spike traps like over here.
[48:18.21]Like, do not step on this.
[48:19.99]Okay.
[48:20.81]And if there's a trap in the wall, you're supposed to walk back and forth in front of it like three or four times.
[48:26.67]Yeah, I know you're making it.
[48:29.61]Okay.
[48:30.33]I've learned a lot about this game, but mostly only from Jeremiah.
[48:34.17]Everybody does that.
[48:34.83]It's not just me.
[48:35.48]Everybody does that.
[48:36.84]Watch out.
[48:38.00]There's a player down here.
[48:39.60]We don't know if they're friendly.
[48:40.94]Who cares?
[48:42.16]Okay, so we have a little group here.
[48:44.12]Friend or foe?
[48:44.88]Friend or foe.
[48:45.60]How are they?
[48:46.24]Yeah, we're friendly, everybody, if you can hear me.
[48:49.05]I have voice chat on so they can hear me, but I can't hear them, so I can't get banned.
[48:54.11]Shit, I got hit by that.
[49:00.82]Hey, actually, make sure you say, like, hey, we're friendly until it counts in the end.
[49:05.45]We're friendly until it counts in the end, I've been told to say.
[49:08.88]You don't actually say that.
[49:12.00]Oh.
[49:13.00]I'm not going to attack you.
[49:13.90]I'm not going to attack you.
[49:14.58]Don't... No, it'd be cool to have a cleric.
[49:16.44]It's cool to have a cleric.
[49:19.38]Why did you hit him?
[49:20.26]No, now they're going to... No.
[49:22.60]That was an accident.
[49:23.48]He's new.
[49:23.98]He's new.
[49:27.53]Really, we don't want to... You're cool.
[49:29.51]It's fine.
[49:32.37]Until it counts in the end, we're not going to kill you.
[49:37.31]Hey, can you heal?
[49:38.21]Can you heal our like goofy ass friend?
[49:42.57]People on the other side of this door.
[49:45.98]There's a. You disabled input but not outputs as a chat member.
[49:50.86]Is that you?
[49:52.12]No, there's someone behind the door.
[49:53.16]They're throwing fireballs.
[49:54.58]They're getting real.
[49:55.23]All right, let's let's fuck them up.
[49:59.93]Oh, I'm just taking damage.
[50:01.03]That's awesome.
[50:01.95]Oh no.
[50:02.59]Oh, that was a spike trap.
[50:03.51]Spike trap right here.
[50:06.91]Oh, my God.
[50:08.21]Hey, we're friendly.
[50:08.97]We're friendly.
[50:09.85]Guys, I'm about to... I'm kind of about to die, I think.
[50:13.20]Watch out!
[50:13.90]Watch out!
[50:14.60]Oh, the Claire's going to die.
[50:19.80]I have a campfire here if we needed to heal up.
[50:22.06]Stir, you're killing the person.
[50:24.23]Stir, what are you doing?
[50:25.91]Oh, my God.
[50:27.65]No, he's the worst.
[50:28.59]He's the worst.
[50:30.07]We got to get him out of the fucking game.
[50:31.41]He's already a fucking problem.
[50:32.83]He's already a massive... He's a massive problem already.
[50:37.84]He had a lot of shit on him.
[50:38.74]Okay.
[50:40.96]Hang on, hang on.
[50:44.57]Good.
[50:47.25]Ow!
[50:47.37]I went into the trap.
[50:48.21]He bounced me into the trap.
[50:51.51]Oops.
[50:55.40]This is such a bad place to fight, too.
[50:56.52]I'm trying to like... Yeah, it's a really bad place.
[50:59.38]Ah, shit.
[51:02.61]He's going after me.
[51:03.34]Dead.
[51:03.48]Dead.
[51:04.44]Got one.
[51:05.06]You got him?
[51:06.38]Okay.
[51:07.08]Okay, cool.
[51:07.74]I think it's just... There's one other guy in there too, right?
[51:10.84]I don't know if there's another guy.
[51:12.11]That might have been it.
[51:12.69]There is.
[51:13.17]There is one guy in there.
[51:14.51]He looks like a wizard.
[51:16.07]I can't believe I'm looting the person.
[51:17.69]This is... Unbelievable.
[51:19.43]And look, there's a nice bow and shit.
[51:21.48]That's my kill.
[51:23.80]Are you seriously looting him right now?
[51:25.82]I'm naked, I got the kill, and you're looting it.
[51:28.38]I dropped the bow on the ground.
[51:29.56]It's a blue bow.
[51:29.90]Do you guys want a full heal?
[51:31.96]Yeah, let's do it.
[51:33.97]Alright, come follow me, I think.
[51:35.39]We gotta get the safety.
[51:36.69]Did you get the bow?
[51:37.97]Yeah.
[51:38.97]That doesn't seem good.
[51:40.29]Revive him?
[51:40.73]Oh shit, there's a whole other party over here.
[51:45.98]Oh shit.
[51:46.44]Okay, I don't know if I can full heal.
[51:47.48]It's gonna take a while to full heal, and we got a circle closing in.
[51:50.86]Yeah, let's get in the circle.
[51:53.07]Alright.
[51:53.93]We should try to get out of here.
[51:55.23]The portals are opening.
[51:56.19]We should try to find some.
[51:57.33]Skeleton!
[51:58.69]Okay.
[51:59.44]Hey, creepo man!
[52:01.02]Come over to us.
[52:02.60]Well, there's another exit.
[52:03.42]Why don't we take the other exit and avoid the combat?
[52:06.97]We gotta get into the circle.
[52:08.41]Yeah, it goes into the circle as well.
[52:10.15]And we missed a bunch of treasure, too, but that's okay.
[52:14.63]Beware of traps.
[52:15.79]This is a trial run for stir.
[52:18.24]Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[52:20.94]I cannot believe... That person is probably so pissed because it was like, oh, yeah, we're playing it.
[52:25.50]Oh, there's people here.
[52:34.95]You get any hits?
[52:36.49]Uh, not really.
[52:37.21]Oh, fuck.
[52:38.31]Big, big cast here.
[52:40.61]I think I might be able to... Yeah, they're going to shoot down the hall.
[52:46.85]We might be able to ambush here if we pull back.
[52:49.56]Stir, are you dead?
[52:51.36]I exited.
[52:52.24]What?
[52:53.58]Wait, you got out?
[52:55.16]Yeah.
[52:57.30]Wait, where?
[52:58.16]Where did you go?
[52:58.74]You left us.
[53:00.74]In the room we were in, there was an exit.
[53:04.08]And he had nothing.
[53:06.14]Friendly.
[53:06.74]We're friendly.
[53:09.32]Oh my god.
[53:10.76]They're right behind us.
[53:11.48]They're right behind us.
[53:12.16]Okay, okay.
[53:12.52]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[53:15.92]Close the door.
[53:16.44]Close the door.
[53:17.44]Vinny, did you pick up anything?
[53:18.48]I got nothing.
[53:18.96]I got nothing.
[53:19.78]All right.
[53:20.66]Be well.
[53:20.92]All right.
[53:22.28]I'm going to do my best.
[53:23.45]I just need to figure this out.
[53:26.91]Be well.
[53:28.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[53:29.13]Your wizard is low HP.
[53:30.95]You, the fighter, valiant, noble fighter, just left the wizard with no HP.
[53:36.94]Well, here's the thing.
[53:37.94]So let me explain.
[53:38.94]Let me explain how this game works, Stir.
[53:41.14]Okay.
[53:43.16]I found a blue sword, which is, like, really good for my class.
[53:46.56]I mean, it's like, that's a big deal.
[53:48.78]There's no trading unless you have to, like, pay or, like, bring it and drop it.
[53:53.65]Hey, can you hear me?
[53:54.25]You want to share the campfire?
[53:55.55]It's going to be cool.
[53:56.69]All right, never mind.
[53:57.23]I'm dead.
[54:00.75]funny it's so awful um chad are you sure that my output um can you guys hear me in game germ I I have voice chat turned off uh I had a I had it was off by default I'll turn it on and I can I had an issue a couple nights ago where I had a kind of a you know somebody an incident somebody said something and it's like okay well now we fucking have to turn it off yeah that's yeah 100 so I turned off
[54:29.82]But, yeah, I, uh... Check, check, check.
[54:31.99]So, the game's pretty easy, huh?
[54:34.73]But, here's the thing, Stir, what you did was not necessarily wrong, because you got a blue bow, but the problem is... So, you could, like, just stash that.
[54:42.16]The stash is not shared.
[54:45.70]So it's not like, oh, I'm going to make a ranger and just go to my shared stash.
[54:49.02]That's not in the game.
[54:50.78]So if you want to put that on a ranger, you're going to have to, like, give that to one of us and we have to get out and then give it to your ranger or trade it on the market.
[54:59.98]There's a trading market where you can trade with other people.
[55:02.10]But it costs, what, 15 gold to do it?
[55:04.36]You're giving Stir an ethics lesson.
[55:08.44]Okay, so I got nothing.
[55:11.98]And I can't, I can only sell my bow.
[55:17.80]what should I name this rogue uh this archer chat I don't know sneaky archer that's a pretty good name all right god it's not available damn it skyrim you want me to call him skyrim okay I I have a game mechanics question teacher why are there um like 12 merchants
[55:41.43]Uh, it's because... You sell different things per merchant.
[55:44.75]Okay, yeah.
[55:45.27]So, for instance, the collector.
[55:48.13]The collector wants to take, like, gems, jewels, bangles, chalices.
[55:56.61]That's who you sell all that to.
[55:59.45]And I know, I know, let me, I just want it in one spot.
[56:02.83]I just want to hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
[56:04.69]Sometimes, Stir, you gotta slow down and enjoy the lore.
[56:07.35]Okay?
[56:07.53]Okay.
[56:11.33]Okay.
[56:12.24]So the collector, you can sell those little.
[56:16.64]Who would I sell the bow to?
[56:18.38]We're looking at.
[56:19.46]The weaponsmith or the armor.
[56:20.66]Okay.
[56:22.98]Selling that bow.
[56:23.92]I mean, but maybe if you do have a ranger.
[56:25.68]I'll take it.
[56:26.36]Yeah.
[56:27.84]I just made a ranger.
[56:28.66]Do you want the bow?
[56:30.75]You can sell it if you want.
[56:32.59]I mean.
[56:34.45]Honestly, I escaped on my first game.
[56:37.55]I got a kill and I didn't even have any clothes on.
[56:39.63]So I don't even think I need the bow.
[56:43.11]I can give it to you yeah just bring it in the mission then drop it on the ground we'll take it because I just made a ranger because I want to I feel like um my wizard I was just getting no no attacks on enemies really I can't believe you killed that that person was being so nice to us too
[57:02.20]I know everybody's saying, hey, dude, you should buy the thing for the gold stash, right?
[57:06.80]But I'm a weirdo.
[57:09.98]And I want to, like, fill half the stash with this because I like the way it looks.
[57:15.87]Chat's saying I killed at least two people.
[57:18.17]I think you were part of at least, I mean, the two kills that we got in that hallway.
[57:25.73]Okay.
[57:27.64]All right.
[57:28.10]Yeah, I might go back to wizard then.
[57:30.00]I'll try ranger for a little bit.
[57:31.61]but then I'll go to Wizard.
[57:34.65]How do you level up?
[57:35.42]Because I'm noticing I'm still level one and I feel like I shouldn't be.
[57:41.44]You just got to kill more rats and creatures and skeletons and players.
[57:46.42]It takes a little bit.
[57:47.78]Honestly, all leveling up does is... I feel like a level 15.
[57:53.52]Okay, so when you level up... Look, the game is still making stuff.
[57:56.40]So if you go to... Honestly, you should do this right now.
[57:58.43]What?
[57:59.72]I'm just babbling random words and you took it as an... They're still making the game.
[58:03.98]But hold on.
[58:04.99]Go up to the top.
[58:05.89]Go to class.
[58:06.73]You see the... Go to perk and skill.
[58:10.13]Yeah.
[58:10.63]You have some perks that you... You unlock perk slots, essentially, is how you... Every five levels.
[58:17.03]Okay, I was just... All I was asking was how specifically.
[58:21.30]So you just kill nerds.
[58:22.48]Yeah, just kill people.
[58:23.30]Just kill people, you know... So you're saying it was a good thing I killed that guy.
[58:26.74]Now.
[58:27.26]Now you're flipping again.
[58:31.04]there might be something in that perk listed you'd rather have is what I'm saying.
[58:34.01]So look.
[58:39.21]So is this what it's usually like with you guys?
[58:42.31]Yeah.
[58:43.67]Yeah, yeah.
[58:44.51]It's been like this for fucking 10 years, man.
[58:46.21]10 years.
[58:54.76]That's fun.
[58:56.00]Hi, I'm Vinny, by the way, Star.
[58:57.64]Nice to meet you.
[58:58.80]Yeah, I think I'd like Vinny.
[59:00.19]I think he'd like Vinny, yeah.
[59:01.61]Yeah, you seem nice.
[59:03.37]Thanks, man.
[59:03.89]Appreciate it.
[59:05.19]We were dark-tied friends for a while.
[59:06.61]Come on.
[59:08.21]yeah yeah no me and germa we we hunt ghosts usually or we um we hit people with swords that seems to be like the two extremes of our gameplay me and germa argue okay hold on I have to show this I have to show this on stream this is so stupid hold on uh while you look at your perks I just need to show this on stream
[59:31.52]This is so stupid.
[59:33.78]What is it?
[59:35.28]It's just a dumb picture.
[59:37.86]Okay.
[59:47.92]It's actually overrated.
[59:55.22]Oh, man.
[59:56.12]That's funny.
[59:56.78]I like it.
[59:57.34]Yeah.
[59:57.78]That's a good one.
[59:59.14]Didn't take them that long, huh?
[60:00.42]No, not at all.
[60:01.44]That was a good one, though.
[60:05.72]Alright, are we good to go?
[60:08.76]Yeah, I think I'm ready.
[60:10.44]So we just got to start.
[60:11.44]You need to ready up when you're... One second.
[60:14.86]Okay, sorry.
[60:15.67]I'm comprehending.
[60:16.55]Okay.
[60:22.69]This is a really good sword, actually.
[60:23.93]I killed that guy in two hits.
[60:25.49]I'm not taking it.
[60:26.05]I'm going to leave it.
[60:29.86]Chat, I don't have the picture.
[60:31.52]Jerma had the picture.
[60:32.32]You want me to capture his stream so I could show you the image?
[60:35.58]Yeah.
[60:37.72]He didn't show it to me.
[60:38.94]Here, I have it.
[60:39.76]It was posted in chat.
[60:40.62]I'll show you.
[60:44.10]I feel like it wasn't meant for me.
[60:47.03]No.
[60:49.59]I'm ready.
[60:50.33]Okay.
[60:50.49]All right.
[60:51.69]Will you put clothes on?
[60:52.61]Oh, wait.
[60:53.77]You got out, so you don't have any.
[60:55.05]You threw it all.
[60:55.77]Okay.
[60:56.45]Let's just go.
[60:59.06]I was wondering why, because like you're naked and that's what that is.
[61:02.21]Okay, I get it.
[61:11.59]I like the lobbies go so fucking fast.
[61:13.99]I mean, you're there for five seconds, someone punches you in the back of the head, and then you just start.
[61:19.96]It's good in a playtest environment, though, because there are like 50,000 people playing this game right now concurrently.
[61:25.77]I can't believe how big this game blew up because like when I was playing it for December's test, that was the first time I had even heard of it.
[61:33.03]And then it just like quadrupled and then like times 10 the amount of users.
[61:37.20]Yeah, the first beta was kind of a long wait time.
[61:40.40]I think everybody kind of was waiting.
[61:43.16]Like after that December test, I remember hearing about it and going, whoa, that looks kind of interesting.
[61:47.82]And then it was like, wait, it's actually coming for the Steam demo thing.
[61:50.48]Oh, fuck yeah.
[61:51.14]I think everybody had the same idea.
[61:54.92]yeah I was really addicted to this so it was like four hours hey creepo man yes I'll take orders from your master what do you need from a creepo I need you to you hold if you hold a torch it increases you know what just get in here it's easier to creep in the dark I'm pretty sure creepo man was a stone temple pilot song right chat
[62:19.52]Uh, we got some pants.
[62:20.40]We got some gloves.
[62:20.88]Vinny, what was that thing that you posted about some song that, like, people said didn't exist or something?
[62:26.41]Oh.
[62:27.27]Uh, I was streaming Corruptions the other night, and I was playing GTA San Andreas, and people were all, like, stretchy.
[62:34.07]I was like, they look like rubber bands.
[62:36.40]And in San Andreas, there's a Stone Temple Pilots song.
[62:38.56]So I was like, that's a song from...
[62:41.50]Back in the day, they had a song called Rubber Band Man.
[62:43.52]It's like, Rubber Band, Rubber Band Man.
[62:48.54]And people were like, no, that's not real, Vin.
[62:50.02]That's not a real song.
[62:51.04]And then I found it on an old tape from when I was a kid.
[62:55.80]I honestly thought that was a bit from you.
[62:57.64]I thought it was you singing.
[62:59.98]Oh.
[63:00.48]I was like, oh, this is really funny of him.
[63:02.24]He made this Rubber Band song, and he's saying it's a Stone Temple Pilots song.
[63:07.14]Yeah.
[63:09.21]But it's a real song.
[63:10.49]That's funny.
[63:11.23]Yeah, it's real, yeah.
[63:13.65]By the way, we've lost Creepo, man.
[63:16.16]I'm in the darkness.
[63:17.10]Hey, Star, where are you?
[63:18.88]I'm in the dark.
[63:19.32]Oh, he's back here, okay.
[63:21.30]There's helicopters in this room.
[63:24.32]I feel like we should catch up with Star.
[63:26.32]Can I make the Plants vs. Zombies VOD permanent?
[63:29.50]It already is on the Archive channel.
[63:32.84]Come on, Gwyn.

[63:46.56]Open up every chest, sir, because sometimes it just be something in there.
[63:50.01]You just take everything.
[63:51.53]I feel like it's a waste of time because you guys are already doing it.
[63:53.97]I feel like as a team, we should all have different roles.
[63:57.45]One guy is the looter.
[63:59.52]One guy is the torch guy.
[64:03.19]You know what?
[64:04.13]These pots are also good.
[64:06.93]There's sometimes really good stuff and potions in them.
[64:11.03]There's a zombie down here.

[66:03.05]Hey, stir.
[66:04.29]Yeah.
[66:06.31]Can you wear that outfit?
[66:08.80]Where?

[67:07.85]Is this water or jello?
[67:11.95]Either one.
[67:12.21]Like lime jello.
[67:13.41]Something in between.
[67:14.65]I have plate boots.
[67:18.54]This one had a doublet.
[67:20.28]20 armor.
[67:23.12]Okay.
[67:23.82]Yeah, one of those zombies had plate leggings.
[67:26.66]Oh, leggings.
[67:27.46]Actually, yeah.
[67:28.06]Actually, I probably could use those.
[67:29.20]Let me go back there.
[67:30.80]It's a little dark in there.
[67:32.38]Slapping around.
[67:32.96]I mean, I love the sound in this game that I was telling, like, when I was playing with my mods the other day.
[67:37.42]And it's like half of the sound effects in this game are just feet slapping on, like, wet concrete or, like, dry concrete.
[67:44.55]The penguin walk.
[67:47.63]Just penguins walking.
[67:48.85]Just sounds like penguins walking around.
[67:50.45]Yeah, I guess it does.
[67:51.73]It's like...
[67:56.13]Now my chat wants to drink the green water.
[67:59.17]They really want it.
[68:00.92]I missed.
[68:01.20]Let's see.
[68:04.62]Heavy gauntlet green.
[68:06.72]It would be good for you.
[68:08.06]It is.
[68:08.56]Thank you.
[68:09.62]How does healing work in this?
[68:14.08]It is red potions, a cleric, or you have bandages or skills.
[68:21.41]I have some extra bandages, sir, if you want to come grab them off me.
[68:24.57]Yeah.
[68:27.81]I just fell back in the water.
[68:28.87]Great.
[68:29.17]Okay.
[68:32.18]Oh, hey, Vinny.
[68:34.80]On the ground.
[68:36.98]Oh, nice.
[68:40.32]Awesome.
[68:40.66]Thank you.
[68:43.22]Hey, CreepoMan.
[68:43.90]You were asked about health.
[68:45.46]Sometimes there's random shrines that just do different things.
[68:48.30]This one is a full heal.
[68:49.68]Interesting.
[68:50.16]Yeah, you might want that.
[68:52.73]I'm praying to my god.
[68:55.09]Nice.
[68:55.75]Who's an awesome god?
[68:59.03]Whoever it is, I'm sure they're awesome.
[69:01.97]The Dark Lord Baphomet.
[69:03.75]Portals have started to spawn.
[69:06.01]And, Ster, you were asking randomly, like, what the fuck's going on?
[69:10.95]Only one person can go in a portal, and they spawn randomly in the area.
[69:14.39]So it's just kind of a mess to try to find one eventually.
[69:16.97]And there are not enough portals for everybody to get out.
[69:20.84]Indeed.
[69:21.24]Yeah, and if it's a red portal, that'll take you to the next floor, which is way more difficult.
[69:25.32]So maybe don't take those right away.
[69:27.11]People.
[69:27.47]Hello there, travelers.
[69:28.47]We are friendly.
[69:30.21]Ah, my head.
[69:31.75]No, you do not want to attack us.
[69:33.13]Oh, they want to go.
[69:33.81]They want to go.
[69:34.35]They want to go.
[69:36.49]I would recommend against it.
[69:39.37]We are heavily armed.
[69:41.09]I'm dead.
[69:44.75]Come on, creepo man.
[69:52.18]Creepo.
[69:52.42]It's up to you now, Creepo, man.
[69:53.80]You gotta carry on our legacy.
[69:55.04]I have a lot.
[69:55.44]I have actually a lot of stuff.
[69:57.54]Yeah.
[69:58.40]At this point right now, Stir, just try to find a blue portal and do not engage anybody.
[70:03.49]And close doors behind you, too.
[70:04.99]That's a good strategy.
[70:07.35]Yeah, your goal is to... When you go through that room.
[70:09.33]Yeah.
[70:10.39]Just try to find a blue portal as the only goal you have and do not engage and just hide and sneak around.
[70:16.57]Oh, I'm a gamer.
[70:18.53]We'll see.
[70:25.58]Chad, are you sure they can hear me with my audio settings as they are right now?
[70:29.32]I don't think I could hear you in game, but I kind of walked away, so I don't know.
[70:32.70]That's so funny.
[70:33.60]We kind of just, if they couldn't hear you, we were just kind of seeing how they reacted.
[70:37.06]We just kind of was standing there, and I got hit in the head with an arrow.
[70:39.95]Yeah, basically.
[70:42.91]It's like, oh, these three guys are just standing still.
[70:45.51]Free headshot.
[70:52.07]My God, Creepo, man.
[70:53.33]What the fuck?
[70:54.19]There's two groups here.
[70:59.67]That's an escape portal, my friend.
[71:01.29]Where are some blue portals?
[71:02.89]Right next to you.
[71:05.73]That one, that blue one.
[71:06.61]You just have to activate it, and it takes about 10 seconds to activate.
[71:09.15]And anybody can walk through it.
[71:12.91]I can't believe you're going to make it, dude.
[71:14.43]You're going to make it.
[71:15.29]Nice.
[71:15.73]Nice work.
[71:22.50]so now you go to your you know your stash and this is where you make the decision on hey bro uh do I want to bring something with me next time or do you stash it to make sure you can keep it are you just auto you're selling all your chalices and bangles
[71:39.60]They have no other purpose.
[71:42.03]To the collector.
[71:45.79]And then... Can you hear me in game right now?
[71:48.29]You hear an echo?
[71:48.95]Yes, I do.
[71:50.17]Sick.
[71:50.43]Okay.
[71:50.75]So yeah, those dudes heard us and then they killed us.
[71:54.19]Yeah.
[71:54.85]I heard you guys talk to them and I walked away.
[71:58.16]Oh.
[71:58.80]Okay.
[72:00.20]I'm sorry.
[72:01.76]I have an ethical question.
[72:06.26]Yeah.
[72:07.46]I have a purple, like an epic chest that you could wear right now.
[72:13.29]Me?
[72:13.87]No, Vinny.
[72:15.11]It's for a ranger.
[72:16.43]It's literally purple.
[72:18.43]Oh, was I supposed to drop you that bow?
[72:20.25]I had it the whole time.
[72:22.35]Oh, yeah.
[72:24.25]But the reason why it's unethical, and I don't care if you lose it or if you die with it, is because I may have accidentally BM stole this from somebody.
[72:33.15]What do you mean you stole it from someone?
[72:34.41]How?
[72:34.53]Like in-game or what?
[72:36.51]We fought a monster and like it was a solo game and it was a bunch of chaos everywhere and people were fighting and dying and I just we killed this boss thing and then like three or four other people started attacking each other and I just grabbed everything and ran in a portal.
[72:53.00]No, that's fine.
[72:54.08]Oh.
[72:54.66]That's why they make these games.
[72:56.14]I don't think that's an ethical quandary.
[72:57.40]I think that's real.
[72:59.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[73:00.44]Bandages are 45 gold?
[73:05.82]Not what happened.
[73:07.20]Isn't that a rip-off?
[73:09.24]That, Stir, welcome to Dark and Darker.
[73:12.56]It's fucking fabric.
[73:15.37]Well, Stir, that's a pack of three.
[73:18.53]Also, don't ever buy the expensive one.
[73:20.95]Buy the one that's 10.
[73:21.75]It's 15 gold for three.
[73:23.15]Oh, I didn't see that they were different.
[73:25.21]That's for, like, rich Andes that have, like, thousands of gold.
[73:29.22]I got, like, 35 gold that run.
[73:31.86]Is that better than your second run?
[73:35.50]I I don't know I was also alone okay me too in the end we're all alone all right you guys um yeah I'm ready that's right as for that uh yeah you can hold on to that for if you play an archer I don't think I deserve that I'll die what's your question stir
[73:54.26]Well, I have it in the menu item to purchase bandage.
[73:57.53]How do I actually buy it?
[73:58.87]Okay, so you're gonna click it and you're gonna say fill in all stash because that's like, hey, I have the money wherever and just send this a make deal.
[74:06.30]Oh, I thought that meant like, fill my whole stash with as many of these as I can possibly buy.
[74:12.22]And how do you switch between your torch and your bandage?
[74:18.94]Oh, three and four are your item slots, so you can switch between them.
[74:23.16]You just cycle.
[74:23.94]Yeah, you have three slots per.
[74:30.69]I knew chat was going to say fill my hole after Stir said that.
[74:33.45]I knew it.
[74:36.09]I'm only going to bring a couple bandages.
[74:38.31]We're still learning.
[74:40.61]Well, some of us are, but you know, whatever.
[74:45.32]Stir, by the way, come look at the dog.
[74:46.96]Look at the dog's name.
[74:48.98]I saw on your stream, I did watch quite a bit, Otto.
[74:51.46]That's, man.
[74:53.42]It's weird they'd name it like a cat that, but... That's close.
[74:58.24]Yeah, I heard about that.
[74:59.41]Do you think that's a reference?
[75:01.99]I'm probably going to say no.
[75:03.73]I kind of feel like it might be.
[75:06.93]I mean, Otto's pretty famous at this point.
[75:10.65]He's a pretty well-known dog.
[75:12.97]Yeah.
[75:13.45]But Otto's just a cool name, I think, so...
[75:16.77]I thought you... I actually thought... Is it dog, right?
[75:20.01]Dog auto?
[75:20.87]Yes.
[75:21.65]Because you said cat a second ago.
[75:22.88]That's the in-game.
[75:23.66]Sorry.
[75:24.42]Well, the in-game is a cat.
[75:25.42]But he has a dog.
[75:27.20]The point is, I thought it was A-U-T-O.
[75:31.86]Like automobile.
[75:32.62]Oh, like a car.
[75:33.16]At one point.
[75:34.12]Yeah.
[75:36.22]Oh, Ster, you got that bow?
[75:38.38]Oh, yeah.
[75:39.08]Hold on.
[75:39.30]Skeleton.
[75:39.70]Skeleton.
[75:41.11]Alright, let's get the skeleton first.
[75:42.05]I'm dropping the bow down here in the light.
[75:43.57]Check this out.
[75:44.22]Check out.
[75:44.74]Check this out.
[75:45.44]Check out this.
[75:48.10]Are there charged melee attacks?
[75:49.24]Oh, shit.
[75:49.68]That's really nice.
[75:50.46]Thank you.
[75:51.30]That hurts.
[75:52.48]I don't think there are charged... I don't think so.
[75:55.35]But you do get combos when you continue attacking, and the combos are good.
[75:59.63]Arming sword here.
[76:00.77]I'm sorry.
[76:01.33]I'm still asking questions.
[76:03.15]No, no.
[76:03.57]Dude, this game...
[76:06.84]I think it's B, but I rebound it, so I don't know.
[76:08.77]Okay.
[76:10.24]Pretty sure it's B. It is B. That's weird.
[76:14.54]Good.
[76:14.82]Now, ask as many questions as you want, because this game is kind of like, like, what the hell is happening?
[76:20.81]I don't know what's going on.
[76:22.09]And I think a lot of people maybe open this game and play for, like, 20 minutes and go, this is stupid.
[76:26.51]And they kind of, it's like, it's almost like, oh, shit, wait, okay.
[76:30.31]Almost like when you first, I remember when I first played Dark Souls, and I remember just running around in circles, not understanding anything.
[76:36.58]There's a group behind us, there's a group behind us in the door where we started.
[76:43.55]Yeah, Creepo's going in the hole.
[76:45.72]Wait, in the hole?
[76:47.42]Oh, they're here.
[76:47.88]Oh, they're behind us in this door.
[76:49.42]All right.
[76:49.68]Where do you guys want to go?
[76:50.68]Hole or this way?
[76:51.18]You guys want to take the Creepo strategy and just, like, get quiet?
[76:54.09]We could.
[76:54.43]Yeah.
[76:56.39]Put your torches down.
[77:09.99]Yeah, this is like Tarkov is one of those games that I just it just didn't click with me.
[77:14.32]Yeah.
[77:15.66]And this is very similar to Tarkov, but I feel a little bit more user friendly to start.
[77:20.82]Also, Dark Souls.
[77:21.72]They're coming through that door.
[77:22.76]I'm still back here.
[77:24.80]They come through.
[77:25.28]OK, they might be engaging.
[77:30.83]I don't know.
[77:31.83]I think I think we'll come back here.
[77:33.25]Let's fight them.
[77:34.17]And also, but don't come back here because I threw caltrops in front of the door.
[77:37.59]We will lose.
[77:39.46]We will lose?
[77:40.78]Okay.
[77:41.10]It was like one ranger.
[77:42.12]Maybe.
[77:46.00]Yeah, games like this.
[77:46.88]Guys, the reason why I'm saying ask as many questions as you want.
[77:51.17]I played this for like 30 minutes, 40 minutes.
[77:53.53]And I was like, this is the worst game I've ever played.
[77:55.59]I was like, this is probably the worst game I've ever played.
[77:58.83]And it took me like an hour or two to be like, wait, this actually is like one of the most fun things I've ever done.
[78:05.62]Yep.
[78:06.40]Yeah, really, this clicked where Tarkov didn't for me.
[78:09.53]Which is weird, because you know what, Bloodborne clicked for me 100%, but Dark Souls never did.
[78:14.85]And I've gone back to Dark Souls like three times, and I still have not.
[78:18.29]I just have no desire to return to it.
[78:20.51]But I love Elden Ring, completed it like fully.
[78:23.28]Loved Sekiro, loved Bloodborne.
[78:25.44]I tried Dark Souls, just didn't, it was just too much for me.
[78:28.70]And I'm getting shit from that.
[78:30.00]I'm getting shit for that from my chat, from people who know that story already.
[78:35.22]God damn it.
[78:36.42]Okay, no, I am confused.
[78:39.68]how I take out the bandages.
[78:41.60]Like, no button.
[78:43.14]They're all on green.
[78:45.70]Oh, I see.
[78:46.25]Okay.
[78:46.87]I got it.
[78:47.87]And it takes about ten seconds.
[78:49.79]It's not very much, but it's enough to kind of... I think I'm rogue, so I get, like, the super action speed.
[78:56.73]Yeah, that would be resourcefulness.
[78:58.43]It's a stat.
[78:59.61]It's an insanely important stat eventually here because it just lets you do things so quickly.
[79:04.23]Some classes have awful resourcefulness.
[79:07.57]Cleric is, like, one of the slowest in the whole game, right?
[79:12.12]but stir you are going to inevitably take more damage if you're naked yeah but I'm not going to take any because I'm going to be evasive you know I know that I had a dodge okay
[79:23.95]Getting over the initial hump of, I don't get it, I died to the first skeleton, and I don't get it.
[79:30.93]If you can get over it and try to understand it, then it's like, oh wow, this is actually really fun.
[79:37.28]Which goes for most things, right?
[79:39.46]You have to give it the time, I guess.
[79:41.90]Yeah, this one deserves the time because it's rewarding.
[79:45.62]It's really worth it, but...
[79:49.46]Also, Stir, if you want to know, red, like a red skeleton or like a red spider, is an elite.
[79:56.09]Which means they're obviously elite and they hurt, but they have more stuff.
[80:00.77]Okay.
[80:04.59]There's also another mode that I would like to try at some point tonight.
[80:09.26]It's called High Roller.
[80:11.58]And we have to pay 100 gold to go in, but it's much harder and much more better stuff drops.
[80:17.76]I'll tell you what, when you end up playing with like Kryken or whoever, you could do that one because I have zero, I have no money on this character.
[80:25.65]But that sounds, that sounds like butt clenching.
[80:30.95]Yep.
[80:32.77]Is there any way to tell if a chest is a mimic?
[80:35.35]I don't know.
[80:36.39]You just kind of have to find out.
[80:38.98]But you have enough time to run from the mimic.
[80:40.94]That's the one saving grace.
[80:48.35]Maybe if you hit it.
[80:54.64]Oh, big, big door.
[80:56.12]Big, big, scary door.
[80:57.24]It is a big, scary door.
[80:58.12]That means it's a big thing in there.
[81:00.78]Yeah.
[81:01.11]In there, there's like a wizard or a champion or something.
[81:03.79]I'm not mistaken.
[81:05.42]And also, as we get closer here, tons of people are going to be kind of collapsing on these rooms, and we could just get just dumped on.
[81:13.57]Yeah.
[81:14.65]I'm... Decent shield here for you, Jerma.
[81:17.27]Ooh, I just found one.
[81:19.29]Ooh, buckler?
[81:21.98]Or... I'll take it, but...
[81:27.12]Yeah, the one I have is more defense.
[81:28.72]Do you guys want to go in the Omega door or do you want to just leave it alone?
[81:33.67]Let's get the skeleton first so we don't get ganked up by skeletons.
[81:40.26]right I closed the door there's a lot there was a lot of skeletons by the door yeah we could probably kill them I was gonna close the doors behind us make sure you know well there's skeletons up here too we can systematically kind of like go uh from up to down and I can like snipe some skeletons that we can we can make it work I think is there any shield that the rogue can use
[82:04.77]I don't think so.
[82:10.91]Ooh, Vinny, Vinny.
[82:14.21]You're gonna want to take a look at that.
[82:17.36]Oh, it's another blue one?
[82:19.82]Here, take a bandage.
[82:22.34]Alright, thanks.
[82:26.30]We want this big mega chest.
[82:28.27]Circle's coming.
[82:31.03]You can open it, because you can pick locks.
[82:33.71]I have never picked a lock in the circles right here, so I don't want to jump in the death room.
[82:39.63]I mean, also, that white altar there, that's a Shrine of Resurrection.
[82:45.73]Like, if I die and you take my soul, you can resurrect me.
[82:49.61]Okay.
[82:52.99]okay nobody else is here I mean you could just try to run over there and just snipe it but oh there's an exit portal across the hall like across the like on the other um um banister over there anybody want to get out now um I'm kind of liking this uh the hardcore permadeath mode I'm playing with uh creepo man right now he's never known the touch of death
[83:17.15]I mean, I do have some decent bows now, so I might go.
[83:20.01]Oh, and I got a ranger.
[83:20.89]Oh, man.
[83:21.57]Yeah.
[83:21.89]Yeah, I have some decent stuff.
[83:23.29]I should probably leave.
[83:24.13]You should get out of here.
[83:26.05]Let me see if I even can.
[83:26.99]Oh, there's a skeleton behind us.
[83:34.91]I forgot the ranger has food that you can use.
[83:39.77]Give me a burger.
[83:43.03]He's in a really weird spot.
[83:44.01]Alright.
[83:46.53]Yeah, you can make it.
[83:47.25]Okay, cool.
[83:48.89]Appropriately, I took the creep perk, which makes my crouch walking, I think, make less noise.
[83:56.34]Oh, another one.
[83:57.64]Oh, but it still sounds like it makes a lot of noise when I'm crouching.
[84:01.86]Is that imaginary?
[84:05.08]Good luck, you two.
[84:05.73]I think...
[84:07.67]I think you.
[84:09.65]You always make noise, I think, but there's a group in here.
[84:12.21]I mean, we could kind of and there's a red portal.
[84:14.79]He went the other way.
[84:16.71]Here.
[84:18.81]Gonna get a little greedy stone cleric in here.
[84:22.09]Just one.
[84:22.41]They're probably together.
[84:25.12]I only see one.
[84:26.76]You can try to go for the jump.
[84:28.71]No, there's two.
[84:29.27]There's a cleric and an archer.
[84:30.23]And now there's three people.
[84:31.77]Okay.
[84:31.97]Oh, they just killed somebody.
[84:33.47]We can sneak up behind them.
[84:35.29]There's a fourth guy in here taking an exit portal.
[84:37.11]He's taking the portal.
[84:37.79]Oh, there they are.
[84:39.47]They're shooting at us.
[84:40.05]They're attacking.
[84:41.46]I'm just going to engage.
[84:43.18]Okay.
[84:46.78]Oh, there's three.
[84:48.50]Chat, what button goes to first person again in spectator mode?
[84:56.01]Try to get out of there, sir.
[84:58.49]Yeah, I'll try.
[85:01.33]Oh, it's literally on the screen.
[85:02.61]Wow, that's amazing.
[85:06.10]Oh, you're dead.
[85:06.60]Jeremy, you're dead.
[85:08.30]Yes, 3V1.
[85:09.94]Did you have anything?
[85:11.74]No, not really.
[85:13.60]Okay.
[85:15.31]Wow, Sturr.
[85:15.93]You know what?
[85:17.53]For your first time playing, you've been escaping a lot.
[85:19.63]When I first played this game in December, I probably... It took me two hours of gameplay of failure to escape one time.
[85:28.30]I'm okay dying.
[85:29.36]I'm okay dying and being like the bait there.
[85:33.00]So you can leave with blue and Sturr, you can leave and make some money.
[85:36.54]I got plenty of money.
[85:37.75]I'm alright here.
[85:38.83]I got plenty of money.
[85:39.65]I'm alright taking the L. Good man.
[85:43.79]Yeah, that's a good man.
[85:48.06]All right, I can do one or two more if you guys want.
[85:50.96]And, you know, I know you'd want to change out, get some other people in.
[85:54.34]Wait, what the?
[85:55.50]Yeah, I mean, pretty much we got like a little group here where everyone wants to jump in and out.
[86:01.29]Yo, 84 gold?
[86:03.87]What?
[86:05.81]Yeah, that's how you make money.
[86:07.17]Are you saying you just made 84 gold?
[86:11.89]Yeah, from that run.
[86:13.15]Yeah.
[86:14.61]That's a lot.
[86:15.92]I don't feel like I...
[86:18.33]uh at what point do I like you know like buy a dagger or something money is you really want to spend your money on the utility stuff so for instance go to at least early on here uh go to merchants and go to the alchemist buying potions and bandages that's kind of early where you want to spend your money because it means you just get to live longer
[86:43.58]But, I mean, by all means, buy a sword, buy a weapon.
[86:46.92]I mean, some of them are expensive.
[86:50.87]Yeah, and usually end up finding better ones in match anyway, but... Yeah.
[86:54.82]Okay.
[86:58.26]But slowly, but surely, you'll kind of increase your survivability because as you notice now, it's just sort of, oh, I took, I'm at 50% HP.
[87:07.43]Okay, well, I'm dead if we find groups of enemies or something.
[87:10.61]Or if you, let's say you kill somebody and you're at like 10% HP.
[87:14.39]If you had bought three potions, it's like, okay, maybe I could keep going and leave and get out.
[87:19.64]So you're essentially trying to survive to the point where you get more and more and more good stuff to then hold on to it for them.
[87:26.26]And you're like, all right, this is the time.
[87:27.62]This is the run where I'm putting this shit on and we're going to go hard.
[87:31.07]That's what you do.
[87:37.65]Another question.
[87:39.25]No, go for it.
[87:40.55]Rogue specific.
[87:41.45]I took the caltrops and it feels like when I use them, I throw them on my own feet and then roll in them and there's nothing I can do about it.
[87:48.98]you can get hurt by your own stuff yes well I mean like I use it and then I there's not even a chance for me to not get hurt by it huh yeah they suck they they feel like they are designed for you like you rub them on yourself they drop behind you oh I've been like looking at the ground and then walking backwards to get away from them
[88:12.90]so you're like you're flattening your own tires that's funny yeah I guess I've been flattening my own tires it's not like team fortress classic caltrops that's funny all right we uh there's pickpocketing is there oh I don't know rogue you can steal an enemy's item from the dungeon what does that what does that even mean that's pretty cool
[88:39.03]Someone in my chat just said, if Jerma had a normal job, he'd be such a nice trainer.
[88:42.61]Hey, thanks.
[88:44.25]Yeah, it's nice.
[88:47.46]Trust me, I do not know that much about this game, but I know enough to, at the very least, explain some very small, basic details.
[88:56.98]And that's pretty much it.
[88:57.76]Yeah.
[88:58.61]Yeah, no, it's pretty important stuff.
[89:01.69]So this is good.
[89:02.39]This is helpful.
[89:03.31]Okay, you guys make friends with someone, I will pickpocket them.
[89:07.21]okay that's that's the plan I'm ready all right I'll try to be really cool and personable to someone if we run across them oh hold on I'll find some clothes so that I can look like reputable okay what's the push dog you said b yeah b like burple b for burple yeah what's wrong with my character's name
[89:46.39]I don't like the sound of that.
[89:47.69]Someone just hurt the dog.
[89:49.35]I know, it's not cool.
[89:50.91]But it's always funny the first one second somebody just always gets hit with a sword and shot with an arrow and then we leave.
[89:55.56]The devs are so dedicated that made this game they killed their own dog for that.
[90:00.16]Oh my god.
[90:02.74]You're a fucking maniac.
[90:05.40]That is maniacal.
[90:14.85]Oh, nice, you got gloves!
[90:16.73]Oh, do I?
[90:17.77]I didn't even know I picked up gloves.
[90:20.13]That's a power move.
[90:21.77]No clothes, underwear, and gloves.
[90:25.19]This is like Homer Simpson gloves.
[90:27.23]These are my pickpocket gloves.
[90:28.51]It's like radioactive gloves.
[90:31.41]Radioactive.
[90:34.24]This is a really big treasure chest in here, but this room is going to become...
[90:40.43]Okay, so there's a mage and that's all spike traps over there.
[90:45.67]I'm going to go for the mage.
[90:50.50]Yeah, we shouldn't even get near this because you probably range it and kill it.
[90:55.21]Well, the spike traps are going to hurt it too.
[90:57.61]Oh, that's right.
[91:04.63]nice dodge that was actually very very well that was great yeah like jumped over it yeah I don't know how I did it but um wizard robe and stuff oh stir yeah man this is all you this is all you
[91:25.23]This one we can open.
[91:27.11]You do not have sufficient skills items to do this.
[91:31.53]Oh, because I don't have the perk.
[91:33.85]Oh, yeah, I took pickpocket.
[91:35.79]Can we break it?
[91:36.45]I think so, but then you lose items.
[91:41.08]Or maybe for the regular chest.
[91:44.10]Can you open?
[91:44.70]Oh, no, you can't open this one either.
[91:45.80]Never mind.
[91:46.30]Oh, skeleton.
[91:48.78]Maybe in the future I could have the lockpick so that I'm useful to someone.
[91:54.62]Lockpick seems very, very, very good.
[92:00.60]Feels like there's a lot of chests that are locked in every single game.
[92:03.48]Okay.
[92:07.67]Can we check the loot here?
[92:10.65]Falchion.
[92:13.49]Jerma, you might want a white falchion.
[92:15.55]It's not bad.
[92:16.29]Yeah, I'll take it.
[92:17.83]What was that, sir?
[92:18.81]What's in there?
[92:19.87]Just a couple of flying skulls.
[92:22.03]Okay.
[92:22.41]All right.
[92:26.79]Uh, we should probably go towards the circle.
[92:29.59]Yeah.
[92:31.01]There's going to be flying skulls, so... Let's get them.
[92:38.12]You can't disarm any of these traps.
[92:40.32]Or can you?
[92:40.72]With like a perk or something.
[92:41.76]I think there was a trap.
[92:43.88]Oh, shit.
[92:44.78]Oh, there's spiders.
[92:47.76]Red spiders.
[92:50.50]Here, I got the light.
[92:52.60]You got this.
[92:55.32]Okay.
[92:56.06]Damn.
[92:59.93]It's a bandage.
[93:02.31]You know, is the lantern any good?
[93:05.73]I've never really used it.
[93:09.03]Oh, you can aim the light.
[93:10.45]I thought it was just a thing that sat on your hip.
[93:13.14]That's what it is.
[93:13.76]You aim it.
[93:14.72]That's cool.
[93:20.07]Jerma, here, why don't you... Oh, shit.
[93:22.53]Um, you know, let's take care of these bugs first.
[93:24.49]We'll talk.
[93:25.47]Oh, this is, uh, stir, this is a spawner.
[93:27.59]This pot.
[93:28.09]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[93:28.95]You got it?
[93:29.45]Okay.
[93:32.77]That's a lot of bugs.
[93:43.30]Alright, um... You look so funny.
[93:45.44]Potion here for you, Jerma.
[93:46.40]Oh, oh, they're eating me!
[93:50.59]You should take the potion at this point.
[93:52.61]No, I have healing.
[93:53.93]I have self-heal.
[94:00.63]There's a lot of shit in here.
[94:01.65]I'm hearing a lot of noise.
[94:04.56]They're eating her.
[94:05.24]And then they're going to eat me.
[94:07.50]Oh my god.
[94:08.60]Oh my god.
[94:10.02]There's a bunch of enemies in here.
[94:12.62]Let's let them come through the door.
[94:13.86]I can shoot them through the door as well.
[94:16.84]It'll take a while, but...
[94:23.06]here oh god he's got me uh there's a spawner in there all right he had a he had a diamond is that do I can make it like a diamond armor yo careful careful careful oh I'm stuck who wants circles coming in who wants the uh potion the fountain of speed or whatever lock pick
[94:55.43]Let me get the spawner.
[94:57.11]Oh, that's not good.
[94:58.63]Oh, man.
[95:00.73]Whoa, I just got pulled.
[95:02.09]Alright, we should go through the door.
[95:08.08]Careful, Ster.
[95:08.66]You're the only one in there.
[95:09.42]I hope I didn't just shoot you, Jerma.
[95:20.77]Did I?
[95:21.01]Nope.
[95:22.43]Okay.
[95:25.43]Okay.
[95:27.61]You look like such a dickhead when you do that.
[95:29.53]Okay, so... Looking down and just stabbing.
[95:34.60]This one is not locked, actually.
[95:36.66]This big chest.
[95:42.00]You guys can take some of the stuff in this big chest if you want.
[95:44.68]Just to sell or whatever.
[95:45.80]I have a lockpick, but I've only... Ow.
[95:48.00]What was that?
[95:48.32]Skeleton.
[95:48.72]Skeleton shooting.
[95:49.48]Oh, shit.
[95:50.18]That's what it was.
[95:51.15]I got the door.
[95:51.67]I'm going to get the door.
[95:52.33]I'm going to get the door.
[95:52.97]I'm going to get the door.
[95:53.83]Okay.
[95:58.21]Another skeleton.
[96:03.32]It's bleeding!
[96:06.90]Nice, sir.
[96:07.44]Okay, is this a shrine of impactful speed, you said?
[96:13.16]um yeah there's that blue shrine um the blue one over there is extra speed but it doesn't really last that long so yeah if you if you die then yeah that's where you bring somebody back shitty well it's not shitty but it's green on this guy over here um then you should just take this
[96:32.39]You know, I'm going to take the shitty green anyway.
[96:35.19]Oh, what's this?
[96:35.91]The health?
[96:36.83]Are you sure?
[96:37.93]I mean, we all have full health.
[96:39.53]We're going to be getting out of here.
[96:41.85]Yeah, we got to get out of here like right now.
[96:43.81]Vinny, what are your final thoughts on Metroid Prime Remastered?
[96:46.11]I haven't finished it yet, so I don't have final thoughts, but it's good so far.
[96:48.30]Okay, let's get out of here.
[96:49.62]Yeah, let's get out.
[96:53.38]It's going to hurt.
[96:55.94]Yeah, this is going to hurt.
[96:56.82]Out, out, out, out, out.
[97:00.35]Trying to speed again.
[97:01.01]All right, mine's still going.
[97:02.33]Vinny, you can just take it.
[97:06.01]All right.
[97:12.25]How do you holster again?
[97:13.77]X. Okay.
[97:15.80]What's down here?
[97:16.44]Whoa, wait.
[97:18.78]Big room.
[97:19.98]No, never mind.
[97:20.96]It's a little secret passage.
[97:21.84]Yeah, that's a connector.
[97:24.08]Don't see anyone.
[97:25.98]A lot of hands on the floor over here.
[97:28.86]This place has been looted.
[97:31.36]Yeah, we're getting out of the final five minutes.
[97:33.26]This is going to start to get a little hairy.
[97:38.92]There's a mimic down there.
[97:39.70]I don't know if it's still alive.
[97:44.67]To the north.
[97:45.07]Turn the roaster on.
[97:46.61]Turn the roaster off.
[97:51.60]This chest hasn't been opened.
[97:53.44]We should just get out of here because we're going to get in trouble by the circle.
[97:57.33]Okay.
[97:58.17]Careful with that jump.
[97:59.53]Yeah, make sure you're holstered before doing that jump.
[98:02.55]How do you do that again?
[98:03.77]X. You just said?
[98:06.81]X. Shrine of Protection.
[98:07.91]I would recommend you get it, Ster, because you're squishy.
[98:12.84]Yeah, you have no gloves on.
[98:14.10]All you got is the gloves.
[98:15.70]Right here.
[98:16.64]This red one.
[98:17.68]But there's a chest.
[98:19.66]Oh, okay.
[98:20.90]It's way more important.
[98:21.80]What was that?
[98:22.58]People coming.
[98:23.16]People coming.
[98:24.04]No, I'm just shooting this... No, there's people behind this door.
[98:27.16]Okay.
[98:27.57]Oh, no shit.
[98:29.81]One guy.
[98:30.19]Hey, you friendly?
[98:33.93]Okay, cool.
[98:35.19]I got my boys down there.
[98:37.61]Are they friendly?
[98:38.87]Are they friendly?
[98:41.60]We are friendly.
[98:42.56]Please do not kill.
[98:44.54]Oh, my goodness, they're friendly.
[98:46.68]Open the door.
[98:47.08]They opened the portal.
[98:53.15]We're all good here.
[98:54.03]How you guys doing?
[98:54.65]Good?
[98:54.95]Just crouch three times if you're good.
[98:59.11]That's three.
[98:59.63]That's awesome.
[99:00.37]That's good.
[99:00.79]I say we should probably try to fight a portal together.
[99:05.13]Stir lockpick them.
[99:06.59]Or pickpocket.
[99:08.04]Did you talk in game?
[99:08.68]Guys, I was kidding.
[99:11.32]Come on.
[99:11.64]That was a joke.
[99:12.56]They're coming back.
[99:13.18]Are they fighting?
[99:13.76]Are they fighting?
[99:20.97]That's a pretty poor joke of you.
[99:22.23]We were just messing around.
[99:23.07]We were just messing around.
[99:24.69]We'll help you.
[99:25.25]We'll help you guys get out of here.
[99:26.57]We don't need to hurt each other.
[99:28.06]This is hard enough without violence.
[99:31.76]You know.
[99:32.26]Oh, hey.
[99:32.64]No, no, no.
[99:33.22]All of us are friends.
[99:34.64]There's like six of us.
[99:36.00]It's not worth it.
[99:36.86]It's not worth it.
[99:38.84]Trust me.
[99:39.79]We're going to get out of here together.
[99:41.09]All of us.
[99:41.43]Everybody just relax and let's do this diplomatically.
[99:43.61]No, we literally just got in a fight.
[99:45.13]We thought you guys were part of this team.
[99:46.51]It's all good.
[99:48.01]We're trying to get out with the loot that we have too, gentlemen.
[99:52.17]What he said.
[99:52.68]I've pickpocketed like six times.
[99:55.28]I found a portal.
[99:58.36]I'm getting out.
[100:02.34]I hate this.
[100:03.34]I hate this.
[100:04.10]I'm opening this fucking thing.
[100:05.64]That guy's gonna fucking get back to home base and be like, what?
[100:08.14]What?
[100:09.10]I thought I... What the fuck was that?
[100:11.10]How did I do?
[100:12.26]What do I do?
[100:12.80]Oh, I tried to open the chest and I seemed to have messed up.
[100:16.16]I didn't open it.
[100:18.72]See, plenty of portals for all.
[100:23.39]Wow, we actually got out.
[100:24.65]Probably should have given that lockpick to somebody to do what they were doing.
[100:28.15]I should have kept pickpocketing.
[100:29.81]Jerma, just run through it.
[100:30.71]Run through it.
[100:31.13]Damn.
[100:34.40]Is this like... Just like hang out near someone that's going to take a blue portal and then just run in at the last second?
[100:42.14]Like a real asshole.
[100:43.42]Oh, there's a portal here.
[100:44.50]Did you really pickpocket?
[100:45.57]Yeah, offer it to him.
[100:49.84]Thank you.
[100:50.34]I really appreciate it.
[100:52.06]Good luck on your journey.
[100:53.12]Good luck on your adventures going forward.
[100:55.48]Gentlemen, I bid you adieu.
[101:00.95]We got it.
[101:01.37]I can't believe this worked.
[101:03.25]What?
[101:06.79]I hate that.
[101:07.69]I don't like this.
[101:09.53]It's too awful.
[101:11.23]It worked?
[101:12.33]What did you take?
[101:13.99]I'm not sure.
[101:14.63]You just hold steel behind them and then it didn't open a menu or anything?
[101:20.17]So I don't know what I took.
[101:21.73]I have 10 silver coins I don't think I had.
[101:23.63]It's jewelry usually.
[101:26.95]Yeah, I did not have these 10 silver coins.
[101:30.45]So you stole silver.
[101:31.63]They probably aren't even going to notice.
[101:32.93]I'll be honest.
[101:35.11]If like a few silver coins are gone from my pocket, I wouldn't even know.
[101:38.53]Oh, I got like throwing knives.
[101:40.61]I didn't have those.
[101:41.44]This is democracy manifest.
[101:48.67]That was amazing.
[101:51.07]And we all made it somehow.
[101:53.39]Someone in my chat just said, I can't believe completely one-sided chatting with randos worked.
[101:58.59]Like, we don't even know what they're saying.
[101:59.89]Yeah, we were just, like, talking over everybody, being cartoon characters, and then it, like, worked somehow.
[102:08.04]Jerma, there was no voice chat in the game last beta.
[102:11.00]This is brand new.
[102:11.92]So you couldn't negotiate, and every time you ran into someone, it was almost a guaranteed death.
[102:16.54]Yeah, that's funny.
[102:20.58]all right do you want me to hop out or um let's take a look I mean I'm gonna be playing this literally all night so okay if you want to stick around if there's other people that are I mean well I could do one more with you okay if that's cool yeah I'll do one more and then I'll bounce and I'll get uh some of my own groups going yeah all right all right I'm thinking about going in with some gear this time
[102:47.25]not thinking of uh thinking I should have pickpocketed more people is this a is this like a like let's go for it round I'm down I mean they went to the red portal I'm wondering if we were like do you think we have the skill for a red portal
[103:04.81]Probably not, right?
[103:05.61]I mean, we could try it.
[103:06.77]Why not?
[103:07.15]Even just try it.
[103:07.75]Okay.
[103:09.07]If we see red portal, we do.
[103:10.83]If not, then we leave.
[103:12.07]It could be fun.
[103:13.61]I'm going to bring at least, like, something.
[103:16.25]Like a better, like, gear.
[103:17.95]Eh, it's all right.
[103:18.85]Well, you know, fuck it.
[103:19.55]Let's just do it.
[103:21.01]Okay.
[103:21.67]Honest to goodness, let's play.
[103:24.26]All right, gamers.
[103:30.22]Stop being rats.
[103:31.06]What do you mean?
[103:35.08]I bought a Glock.
[103:38.32]People saying do not go in red.
[103:39.78]Where do you get that?
[103:42.72]Oh.
[103:46.43]Yeah, we can just try it if we want to.
[103:48.83]Well, we'll see.
[103:49.51]I mean.
[103:49.77]Yeah, the one time I actually maybe two times I went to the red portal.
[103:55.05]It was a nightmare.
[103:56.21]Yeah.
[103:59.73]Oh, that's a yawn.
[104:00.49]That was a dog yawn.
[104:01.47]I thought someone donkey punched the dog last time.
[104:05.24]honest to goodness let's game stir is slowly adding a piece of clothing every run yeah oh do you have something new now he's got a hood now yeah yeah I added something I'm evolving character is developing
[104:37.41]I'm literally just getting rid of trash don't don't pick this stuff up it's bad I need that unless you need boots which germa you you could actually probably benefit from I could probably benefit from just some of this just random stuff the gloves too fair enough whoa I'm so sorry you just punched me yeah I clicked back into the game and just wailed on you
[104:59.11]Hey, this is supposed to be a red portal run, and I'm already down like three or four percent health.
[105:04.12]I mean, I can't even exit the door because you're standing in the way.
[105:06.86]I'm looking at stuff.
[105:08.80]Oh, we were talking about Eternal Cylinder.
[105:10.64]Yeah, I think generally we found that we were in generally the same part of the game when we kind of both had some struggle with it.
[105:20.35]But my chat came into your chat and was like, Vinny hated this game.
[105:23.44]I didn't hate it.
[105:24.96]I liked it enough to finish it.
[105:26.68]Yeah, it was a nice experience.
[105:28.42]It just was a little too long.
[105:30.56]Yeah, like two or three hours too long.
[105:35.13]Vinny, donkey punch does not mean what you think it means.
[105:38.13]Oh, oops.
[105:39.29]Sorry.
[105:40.55]I meant sucker punch.
[105:42.25]What the fuck?
[105:44.41]Maybe we shouldn't ask.
[105:47.25]Oh, 29 damage.
[105:48.85]Almond sword.
[105:51.19]Somebody's shooting arrows at my head.
[105:52.73]Oh, it's you.
[105:55.87]Jerma, when I was playing Metroid earlier, I got the morph ball.
[105:59.98]And I said I got the morph ball.
[106:02.76]Oh, nice.
[106:05.70]Galick is coming into your brain here, I see.
[106:09.80]I killed a skeleton.
[106:15.87]Should I join the party now?
[106:17.27]Oh, hey everyone.
[106:18.21]No, no, no, no, no.
[106:19.23]We good.
[106:19.59]We good.
[106:20.01]We cool.
[106:20.91]No, no, no.
[106:21.33]Don't do that.
[106:21.97]We'll still forgive you.
[106:22.75]We'll still forgive you.
[106:23.45]It's fine.
[106:24.39]Really?
[106:24.87]All right.
[106:25.07]Kill him.
[106:25.37]Kill him.
[106:25.65]He's killing us.
[106:28.39]I'm fumbling the controls.
[106:30.33]I have fumbled.
[106:31.07]Please do not let me fumble further.
[106:32.65]How many... Oh, fuck.
[106:36.37]I'm dead.
[106:39.09]I've accomplished nothing.
[106:43.67]I didn't do my heal either.
[106:44.67]I...
[106:45.44]I got him.
[106:45.80]Wait, what do you mean you got him?
[106:48.02]He's down.
[106:49.74]Like, all of them?
[106:50.57]He's dead.
[106:51.07]There's one guy.
[106:51.77]I don't know.
[106:52.93]There's literally one guy.
[106:54.85]Jeremy, did you kill one?
[106:55.91]I killed one, yeah.
[106:58.76]Oh.
[106:59.28]I ran away like a coward.
[107:00.62]I thought they were friendly at first because he was making sounds.
[107:04.66]When you were like, we're friendly, and he was like... I was like, oh, okay.
[107:08.24]But that was him grunting while he was swinging at us.
[107:11.18]Yes, not friendly sounds.
[107:12.28]Yeah.
[107:14.20]I have your heart, so we can... It's a weird thing to say, but it's true.
[107:18.39]And I can just... We can revive you.
[107:20.89]We can revive you is what I'm trying to say.
[107:24.91]Oh, yeah.
[107:25.69]No, I didn't have it.
[107:26.77]I had literally just absolute dog shit on.
[107:29.23]I had like a... I think I had a green helmet on and that was it.
[107:33.39]Okay.
[107:33.93]Well, I got that.
[107:34.65]So we'll try to find you and get you back.
[107:38.13]Cool.
[107:40.67]Cool gaming.
[107:41.45]People are saying that that was just the barbarian's sound effects.
[107:45.43]Was it?
[107:46.34]No, he was clearly going like over the voice chat, wasn't he?
[107:50.44]I don't know.
[107:51.04]No, that sounded like in-game.
[107:56.68]The guy did not run at you in real life going... I thought he was being funny over the voice comms.
[108:04.81]I don't think he was being funny.
[108:06.61]I'm going to head down this way.
[108:07.75]We can get out of the circle and try to find a Shrine of Resurrection.
[108:12.15]He was.
[108:12.69]Yeah, no, he definitely was.
[108:14.93]Careful.
[108:16.49]Don't stand up, whatever you do.
[108:19.41]I won't.
[108:20.41]Okay.
[108:22.31]My main strategy is letting you go first.
[108:25.93]That's a good one.
[108:26.95]Wait, I'm an archer.
[108:27.65]That doesn't check out.
[108:31.86]Oh, we got a skeleton here.
[108:33.60]Someone might be behind us.
[108:35.50]Can you stop turning those off?
[108:36.62]It's ruining my... I'm trying to watch my TV show of you guys playing and it's dark now.
[108:42.48]And darker.
[108:42.98]Okay.
[108:49.98]Invisibility potion.
[108:52.59]Those are okay.
[108:53.19]You can't really attack when you have them, but... Good to get out of a shitty situation.
[109:03.93]Oh, good luck.
[109:05.77]Yeah, you're not gonna kill that dude.
[109:09.25]Careful, Stir.
[109:09.81]There's another fucking spike in the wall.
[109:12.09]Yeah, that Wraith will kill you both in like one hit.
[109:17.28]Yester, there's like random hard, I guess in quotes, enemies.
[109:22.55]Like I said, I'm pretty familiar with the gameplay, so I've seen wraiths and stuff.
[109:28.13]Did you loot this guy?
[109:29.19]I kind of didn't want to because there was a wraith.
[109:35.03]I felt like maybe.
[109:39.34]Maybe not.
[109:40.82]Oh, they had some gold.
[109:42.06]I took a little bit of their gold.
[109:45.22]I took their pants.
[109:48.38]There's a treasure chest here.
[109:55.92]You know, I do have a campfire kit.
[109:57.48]If we find a nice quiet area, I can... We can recover all of our health.
[110:02.52]Yeah, you absolutely should.
[110:04.20]Especially because you guys are two now.
[110:06.82]If you go against a group of three that have half health versus, you know, you have full health, think about the difference there.
[110:15.05]I'm hearing a lot of footsteps.
[110:16.27]I'm trying, like, I get that it's like you're doing like a stream.
[110:20.07]You're trying to like talk to your friends and shit.
[110:22.09]There's definitely people that way.
[110:26.18]There's a mummy.
[110:28.18]Oh, red mummy.
[110:41.60]Pretty good with that rapier.
[110:43.22]God damn it.
[110:45.26]Ow.
[110:46.38]Yeah, we got to... We desperately got to heal up here, sir.
[110:50.26]You know what?
[110:51.00]You just campfire down here.
[110:51.92]I don't think anyone's going to be coming down here.
[110:53.18]I'm going to use it here, yeah.
[110:53.94]I'm going to use it here.
[110:58.89]Just do me a favor, Stir.
[110:59.93]When you get in here, crouch.
[111:02.49]Don't stand up.
[111:03.24]And also put out the light.
[111:06.64]Maybe.
[111:07.06]All right.
[111:07.78]Okay, get in here before... Okay.
[111:11.76]How much does the campfire heal?
[111:13.24]I know it does refresh on spells too, right?
[111:15.26]I'm not sure about the spell.
[111:17.95]Yeah, I haven't used it as a wizard yet.
[111:22.46]But it looks like it's healing a decent amount for as long as you're in front of it.
[111:26.78]It's like full health for me from... Nah.
[111:29.30]Close.
[111:31.52]40, 50%?
[111:31.74]I'd say it was like 65, 70%.
[111:36.04]It refreshes most skills, not only Wizard.
[111:42.96]That's actually a huge deal.
[111:45.12]Especially if you have one that gets consumed, like the Fighter of Heal.
[111:48.57]That's a big deal.
[111:49.39]Hey, we got a little secret tunnel down here.
[111:52.09]Yeah?
[111:56.90]Oh, it's just the chest.
[111:59.62]I think there's an escape.
[112:01.36]No, that's a wraith.
[112:02.16]He's glowing the same blue.
[112:05.89]Well, now an escape just appeared.
[112:07.55]There's a guy behind us from the way we came.
[112:09.05]That's so scary.
[112:11.59]That is like terrifying looking.
[112:14.93]That's a rogue.
[112:16.11]Is that a rogue or a mage?
[112:18.69]You take it.
[112:20.85]You sure?
[112:21.89]Yeah.
[112:22.93]Alright.
[112:25.14]Alright.
[112:25.46]Nice job.
[112:27.49]Alright.
[112:28.01]Good luck, Ster.
[112:28.79]Looks like a whole party.
[112:32.33]Oh man, yeah.
[112:32.97]Just stay invisible.
[112:36.65]Don't bump me.
[112:43.10]Oh my god.
[112:43.82]Oh my god.
[112:44.14]They're bumping you.
[112:44.64]They're bumping you.
[112:46.06]They might just think it's lag.
[112:49.48]He's like, oh, what was that?
[112:50.30]And they just kept going.
[112:51.14]I mean, that's what I would think.
[112:52.86]If I'm like, why can't I move?
[112:53.70]What's going on?
[112:54.10]That'd be lag.
[112:56.42]You have an invisibility potion too, right?
[112:59.12]Nice.
[112:59.38]Smart, smart, smart.
[113:00.98]Smart gaming.
[113:06.70]Oh, you can't move when you do it.
[113:08.26]Oh, that's so lame.
[113:09.24]Oh, you can't.
[113:11.34]Close the door behind you.
[113:13.17]Yeah, you're in the hell room, Stir.
[113:14.95]Pretty much everybody's going to be here in a second.
[113:17.47]Three minutes.
[113:22.43]Ow.
[113:27.09]Oh, it's a perk to do that.
[113:28.37]It's a perk to make it so you can move ten steps.
[113:30.55]I have that.
[113:31.66]Just talk to them.
[113:32.72]Just reason with them.
[113:38.08]I fucked up.
[113:39.28]I would have stayed invisible, but I have that perk, but it's not my invisibility, so I don't know if it would work that way.
[113:49.11]Jerma, I still have some of this stuff.
[113:50.97]I don't think I can give it to you in the menu here, but...
[113:54.63]No, no.
[113:56.35]The only way you can trade is we would have to both join the trader thing.
[114:02.51]And it's 15 gold to do any transaction, from my understanding.
[114:05.90]Or you have to bring it and drop it, which bringing it and dropping it is a scary thing in its own way.
[114:10.28]Oh, no, I was going to have that perk, but then I had to take pickpocket.
[114:13.00]All right.
[114:15.56]You know what?
[114:16.50]Yeah, you didn't really have anything that great, so fuck it.
[114:19.78]All right.
[114:22.36]Yeah, I didn't know that the rogue had a timer on his stealth either.
[114:29.20]Well, okay.
[114:31.14]Yeah, no, that was fun.
[114:33.12]Vinny, if you're still around, I don't know what time frame you guys are both on, but I'll be up for at least another four or five plus hours playing it.
[114:41.89]Oh my gosh.
[114:43.57]Yeah, I might play, because I streamed the Direct and then Metroid Prime.
[114:46.73]I'm getting a little tired, so I'll tell you what.
[114:48.29]I'm probably only going to play for another hour, but...
[114:50.90]Yeah, do your thing.
[114:51.74]I know you have a bunch of people that want to check out the game.
[114:54.49]Friday too.
[114:55.27]I was planning on playing this Friday and maybe grabbing a couple of other people.
[114:57.95]So anyone want to play on Friday too?
[114:59.66]Dang, he's going all in.
[115:02.02]Yeah, he's going all in.
[115:03.22]I might be around.
[115:04.12]Just hit me up.
[115:04.83]Yeah.
[115:05.87]Let's see who's available in the group.
[115:09.09]As always, good.
[115:10.57]Stir, nice to game with you, gamer.
[115:13.17]Yeah, nice to finally meet you for the first time.
[115:15.56]You too, man.
[115:16.36]I enjoyed this.
[115:17.60]We'll game again sometime.
[115:18.90]See ya.
[115:19.12]Take it easy, Vinny.
[115:22.00]Enjoy Metroid.
[115:22.78]That's so funny that it's just like
[115:29.67]Oh, hey, by the way, it's out today.
[115:31.65]I feel like that's the people are doing that.
[115:33.97]Companies are doing that now.
[115:35.61]What did Nintendo do?
[115:36.97]What's out today?
[115:38.77]Metroid Prime Remaster was announced and came out today.
[115:45.28]Okay.
[115:45.42]All right.
[115:47.24]Okay.
[115:47.86]Okay, so we got a Phil here.
[115:49.72]We're going to bring in Caleb.
[115:51.81]Oh, I love Caleb.
[115:58.12]Caleb's in-game name is fucking crazy.
[116:01.73]I don't even want to type this.
[116:05.51]Who's Caleb?
[116:06.77]Hold on.
[116:13.58]I have to type it, so I'm going to type it.
[116:17.20]Let me get him in here.
[116:25.63]Can I add some?
[116:26.19]Oh, here we go.
[116:36.35]Yo.
[116:37.29]Hello.
[116:39.22]How goes it?
[116:40.52]How are you?
[116:40.98]Can you please introduce yourself?
[116:42.36]Because people have no idea who I'm bringing into the game right now.
[116:47.08]Yeah, my name is Jess Joles, and I'm really nobody.
[116:49.86]But I work for somebody cool.
[116:53.96]And that's how I met Jermo.
[116:57.32]and that's that's all that matters well if everyone's saying who who who he can't talk about it because it's uh it's president biden oh yeah of course yep yep we actually invited him to the white house and um secret service basically so
[117:13.82]Let me add you.
[117:17.62]What's your name again?
[117:18.88]It's this.
[117:20.50]Oh, God.
[117:22.10]It's like that, I think.
[117:26.37]Yeah, that's you.
[117:27.49]There you are.
[117:31.15]Awkward.
[117:33.85]I don't even know how to... We're just going to move on from that.
[117:37.47]Yeah, we're just going to move on.
[117:39.59]You are a player, by the way.
[117:41.41]Stir, he's a player.
[117:43.06]He's a player.
[117:45.00]Okay.
[117:46.12]Just to let you be aware, in case you bring any important items in, my main strategy is running away as soon as anything bad happens.
[117:53.34]And if you expect me to help you, I just want you to be aware that I'm probably three rooms down.
[117:58.67]Oh, perfect.
[117:59.51]No, that's excellent.
[118:00.27]I actually like getting all the kills.
[118:02.71]He's a new player.
[118:04.27]So am I. I started literally two days ago.
[118:07.02]Really?
[118:07.32]Yeah.
[118:07.90]I think we talked about this in the car.
[118:09.20]I think we talked about this game and how I was like literally just ranting and raving about this game.
[118:12.76]Yeah.
[118:13.06]So that's huge.
[118:14.86]Alright, let me bring my best gear so I can be sad that I lost it.
[118:17.82]Oh, don't do that.
[118:19.51]No, no, no.
[118:19.97]I only have purples.
[118:21.03]I only have purples.
[118:21.93]What?
[118:23.21]No, calm down.
[118:23.93]Calm down.
[118:24.47]Hold on.
[118:25.01]You have... Alright, we're going to get carried, Stuart.
[118:26.73]This is going to be great.
[118:27.85]No, no, no.
[118:28.31]Calm down.
[118:29.11]Wait, wait.
[118:29.39]You're a ranger?
[118:29.95]Wait, you're a ranger?
[118:30.99]I'm a rogue.
[118:32.43]Oh, my God.
[118:32.95]That's so upsetting.
[118:33.73]I have a purple bow.
[118:36.81]In the car?
[118:37.35]In the car?
[118:37.87]What do you mean in the car?
[118:39.51]When I, okay, when I was, uh, for a tummy time, got to hang out with a lot of really cool people.
[118:46.03]Um, and just Jaws was one of those people.
[118:50.80]Well, I appreciate that.
[118:51.56]I just happen to be there.
[118:52.86]Right place, right time.
[118:53.64]Uh, all right.
[118:57.82]I am, uh, I'm good to go.
[118:58.92]I'm geared up.
[119:03.04]Actually, do you have a pen?
[119:04.36]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[119:07.15]Maybe I'll bring some good shit.
[119:10.57]Actually, this is probably going to go pretty well, because earlier we were doing some Facebook runs, so it's good to have a Quam Cuzzler.
[119:19.97]It's French.
[119:21.53]It's French.
[119:22.09]You guys are going to get along.
[119:26.06]I already know, so we're good.
[119:27.14]It's going to be great.
[119:30.04]It's a family name.
[119:31.44]I'm already fat fingering my alt.
[119:32.64]This is good.
[119:40.79]All right.
[119:42.21]Here we go.
[119:43.85]So you're a barbarian and you I want to inspect you because I want to see just how hard we're about to get carried here.
[119:51.10]So the beauty about barbarian is once you hit level 15, all you need is a good axe and I'll and just no thoughts.
[119:57.07]You just hit people in the head.
[119:58.85]That's all you do.
[120:00.49]Come here.
[120:00.95]Where are you?
[120:01.87]I'm right here.
[120:03.09]Can I inspect you?
[120:04.93]Yep.
[120:05.75]How do I do that?
[120:06.47]Yep.
[120:06.89]I'll turn over and cough.
[120:09.21]Okay.
[120:09.81]That's a big axe.
[120:11.63]Yep, yep.
[120:12.35]Here, I'll drop it for you here.
[120:13.52]You wanna see it?
[120:14.02]Oh my god, that's scary.
[120:15.50]Oh my god, this thing's crazy!
[120:16.50]Oh my god!
[120:16.86]Oh my god!
[120:17.40]He dropped the axe.
[120:18.48]Whoa!
[120:19.42]Okay, what if I DC or something?
[120:20.68]Take it.
[120:21.26]That's axe caliber.
[120:24.22]I'll never, I'm never speaking again, I'm sorry.
[120:26.24]Anyways, check this out, check this.
[120:28.02]So these big scary guys over here, right?
[120:31.95]Also, my interact speed is awful, but just watch this.
[120:35.49]Just watch this.
[120:37.23]Oh, hello.
[120:39.05]We are essentially going to be.
[120:43.28]And oh my goodness.
[120:44.46]OK, stir.
[120:45.36]I hope you're ready to just kind of like collect items from people.
[120:48.48]I mean, that's all I've been doing.
[120:49.78]So I feel like this is a good even spread.
[120:54.10]So paid actor.
[120:55.36]Have you guys hit the dummy yet?
[120:57.35]Like with the weapons and you like got your numbers like to figure out your damage and all that.
[121:02.56]I haven't gotten any numbers.
[121:04.80]Well, it's kind of hard because the match starts so quickly.
[121:08.19]Oh, yeah.
[121:08.69]Oh, I sprint down there.
[121:09.49]I literally pop my rage and I just like run down to the fucking the dummy really as like quickly as possible.
[121:15.21]So the average like arming sword does 30 damage and this axe does 160.
[121:20.49]Oh, my God.
[121:20.85]All right.
[121:23.39]So you have two little brothers right now.
[121:25.99]Essentially what's going on?
[121:27.59]That's always what I've wanted.
[121:29.13]I will be torch guy.
[121:31.03]Yep, yep.
[121:31.39]Oh, oh, oh god.
[121:32.79]Yep.
[121:33.87]Dead.
[121:35.11]Dead in one hit?
[121:36.15]Oh my god.
[121:37.68]I feel like this is an advertisement for the game.
[121:40.94]Whoa, you could do this.
[121:44.08]This is a very different game.
[121:45.42]Archer up top.
[121:46.02]Archer up top.
[121:46.90]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[121:49.22]One archer, one archer.
[121:50.88]Yep.
[121:53.37]Oh shit, that hurt.
[121:54.97]My bad, boys.
[121:56.79]I'll leave some mobs for y'all.
[121:58.33]Oh my god, there's skeletons in here.
[122:00.37]Help!
[122:00.63]I mean, like, do I have to hit things to level, though?
[122:03.69]Yes, yes.
[122:04.31]So I'm gonna let you tap them, and I'm just gonna kill them.
[122:07.71]Give them a little love tap, let me know you're there.
[122:09.91]Yeah, good boys, good.
[122:12.70]I get, like, credit for the kill if you carry me.
[122:15.78]Beautiful, boys.
[122:16.74]That was excellent.
[122:18.14]And you have a page on e... Oh my god, crunchies.
[122:20.74]epal.com
[122:22.76]epal.com I can buy a purple now by the way from that store I have I got two more crunchies a little uh metagaming tip so if you find something that you like want to give to your friend don't leave it in the chest just take it out and drag it out because the interact speed for other players is trash sometimes you actually both probably have rogues have the highest I think other than rangers yeah I'm rogan I need boots or gloves or something
[122:52.29]Oh, excuse me.
[122:53.71]I have a question.
[122:54.63]You have boots and gloves.
[122:56.77]How do you get down here?
[122:58.16]Dude, I have wondered the same thing.
[122:59.90]Really?
[123:00.30]You said there's no... Okay.
[123:02.78]You'd think I'd know, but I... Actually, you know what?
[123:05.08]Hold on.
[123:06.98]My senses are tingling.
[123:08.44]I think there's a lever somewhere.
[123:13.18]Yeah, you can't break it.
[123:14.28]You can't smash it or anything.
[123:15.32]If I had to guess, it's probably this door right here.
[123:17.84]Watch this.
[123:19.97]No shot, bro.
[123:20.79]I'm a fucking wizard.
[123:21.73]There's a gamer behind us.
[123:24.16]Gamer behind us.
[123:25.00]Where I am.
[123:26.24]Can you kill him in one hit?
[123:28.30]He's opening this door.
[123:29.20]I'm invisible.
[123:30.10]Let me, let me, let me.
[123:31.32]Oh yeah, you got him.
[123:32.68]You got him.
[123:36.89]Yep.
[123:37.21]Yep, boys.
[123:37.71]Yep.
[123:37.93]I didn't hit him.
[123:38.81]I'm helping.
[123:39.23]I'm helping.
[123:39.59]All right.
[123:40.45]The lights are off.
[123:41.03]I can't see.
[123:41.41]Oh my God.
[123:41.81]There's a mummy.
[123:42.93]I lit it up.
[123:44.19]I'm lighting it up.
[123:45.33]I don't know how I didn't hit him.
[123:49.87]I'm stunning the mummies.
[123:55.51]That group is still over there, I think.
[123:56.71]100%.
[123:59.81]I'm creeping.
[124:00.81]They're looking at us just playing musical chairs with the mummies and they're just like, oh, this is easy.
[124:05.82]They probably saw your axe and probably just went, oh, shit.
[124:10.68]They went, do you know what door they took?
[124:12.48]There's beds in here if you guys want to take a nap.
[124:14.58]Wait, wait, I think they did the loop-de-loop and pull.
[124:16.39]I think they went, no, they didn't.
[124:17.59]Hold on.
[124:21.11]Friends, are you still there?
[124:21.99]Still there.
[124:22.35]I miss you.
[124:22.75]I miss you.
[124:24.67]I'd say we're just trying to find the portal, if you've seen one.
[124:29.71]Oh, oh, we're in RP.
[124:31.81]Why does everybody hate that voice?
[124:40.42]It's not Stewie Griffin.
[124:41.64]It's fucking somebody else.
[124:43.86]It's like the Stanley Parable.
[124:46.45]Now, would either of you happen to have, like, any healing of anything?
[124:50.70]Um... If not, don't worry about it.
[124:53.88]It's fine.
[124:54.78]No.
[124:55.58]I couldn't possibly need it.
[124:56.94]I couldn't possibly take it.
[124:58.48]I got just full diapy.
[124:59.72]I can't even...
[125:08.17]Why?
[125:09.65]There's not... Okay, let me just go over a few things.
[125:11.95]There's not a single solitary reason for you to have said that right now for any reason.
[125:17.18]I don't have it.
[125:18.46]There's not a single reason to say what you just said.
[125:22.42]Nope.
[125:24.66]He was asking what we had.
[125:26.99]So you have shit of into a fold.
[125:29.22]You've shit into a diaper to fill it up is what you're telling us.
[125:32.68]That's all you have.
[125:34.50]It's loaded.
[125:35.48]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[125:36.22]Oh, my God.
[125:36.60]There's healing right here.
[125:37.62]Oh, my God.
[125:38.38]Praise the heavens.
[125:39.34]Nice.
[125:41.92]And I just said it now.
[125:42.72]You've ruined everything.
[125:46.48]I'm sorry.
[125:47.72]I'm dumb.
[125:48.24]No, no, no, no, no.
[125:49.79]My intelligence is six.
[125:50.95]It's six.
[125:51.77]Not you.
[125:52.21]I'm talking about Creepo, man.
[125:54.31]Oh.
[125:55.08]There's a man.
[125:55.66]There's a guy fighting spiders in there.
[125:56.78]Alright, alright.
[125:57.28]With two people.
[126:01.74]Hey, it's your last day on this planet.
[126:03.30]What do you mean?
[126:11.04]Oh my god.
[126:12.74]GG's boys, GG's.
[126:13.64]I have to go over here.
[126:15.08]I wasn't a part of that.
[126:18.16]No, you were.
[126:18.70]You were an accessory.
[126:19.82]If we all get charged for murder, it's all equally on us, you know?
[126:26.44]Oh, there's a Zweander too!
[126:27.98]That was a- Oh, boys, boys, you're making family mistakes.
[126:30.27]Alright, look at this, look at this, look at this man.
[126:31.95]Look at this man.
[126:32.41]Everybody inspect the rogue.
[126:33.59]What?
[126:33.87]Okay.
[126:36.05]On this rogue was a ring, okay?
[126:37.91]You guys missed it.
[126:38.93]What?
[126:39.41]This is a common mistake.
[126:40.87]Oh, shit.
[126:41.09]Demon eyes over here?
[126:42.11]Yeah.
[126:42.49]Don't miss rings.
[126:43.67]Oh my god.
[126:44.41]And a necklace, and a necklace.
[126:45.78]Oh my god, this is an awful day.
[126:48.80]Whoa.
[126:50.72]Happens to the best of us.
[126:52.56]I'm gonna put on the Zweander.
[126:54.96]I mean, I said the Dypey thing, but I think Zweihander's worse.
[126:57.89]So Zweihander's, like, if you right-click it, right-click... Oh, not close to anybody.
[127:02.21]Jesus.
[127:02.67]What?
[127:05.55]You literally helicopter around.
[127:07.43]Oh, please, please, God, no, please.
[127:09.80]Oh, no, please, no, please, no.
[127:11.58]I'm not gonna do... I am not gonna kill you for a joke.
[127:14.60]I actually...
[127:16.10]No, I just... I mean, you would, but I... Not when you're decked out in purples.
[127:21.69]If you ever have all these purples, there's no way I'd kill you for a joke.
[127:25.97]I literally have on a gray armor and just this purple axe.
[127:29.23]That's the barb life.
[127:30.81]Yeah, but that's the whole thing right there.
[127:32.73]There you go.
[127:33.37]Oh my god, a potion.
[127:34.68]Oh, beautiful.
[127:42.10]So you guys...
[127:44.60]So what if you say that, like it's your last day on Earth, and then they kill you?
[127:48.87]That doesn't happen.
[127:49.59]That's never happened in my entire streaming career, ever.
[127:52.87]What if it does?
[127:55.15]I was thinking, what if he just gets headshot by an arrow?
[127:58.44]I have absolutely talked mad trash and gotten stomped before, and it's very upsetting.
[128:02.44]I got a surgical kit.
[128:04.10]Alright, let's go inner circle.
[128:05.76]You should take that.
[128:08.39]oh oh where where where's that surgical kit boy I I I'm holding it I don't want you to have it let's go beautiful I feel like you're already strong enough like you really need to heal uh well if another barb hits me in the head I'm definitely dead but
[128:28.70]You know, honestly, I do get increased strength with lower strength.
[128:33.72]Sorry, lower health.
[128:34.86]So if you do die, we need to make sure we get that axe then, right?
[128:39.26]No, no, no, no, no.
[128:40.63]It's fine.
[128:41.67]It's fine.
[128:42.61]I'll just cry about it.
[128:43.33]I mean, that sounds cool.
[128:48.75]Stir is such a chad.
[128:49.79]Somebody said that about Easter?
[128:52.43]I don't know.
[128:52.69]They just said it.
[128:54.01]okay well thank you for reading that comment instead of like the one guy who probably said something negative it's a big moment negative chats don't exist we just don't we just don't read those uh there's red portals over here oh those are those are evil I know but like I feel like you have a one-shot kill axe if you're if you're scared of the red portal I'm scared of the red portal I am I am indeed scared of the red portal I am a big I mean I'll go I'll go but
[129:23.50]I mean, I've been, I've been, I've done it.
[129:27.12]I think it would be you versus the dungeon and we would just be running behind you picking up things.
[129:31.89]I think, so what I would do is if I was going to go red dungeon, we would all have to be clerics and we would just spam the heal spells to kill everything and then bring a bunch of campfires.
[129:40.59]That's my meta.
[129:41.13]Oh, there's a blue portal if anybody wanted to guarantee their loot.
[129:46.30]Ow!
[129:47.60]Did you?
[129:48.86]I get hit by these all the time too.
[129:53.45]All right.
[129:53.67]Are you guys looking for action?
[129:55.77]Are you guys looking for loot?
[129:56.57]What's the deal here?
[129:57.45]I think I'd like to... I have two crunchies and it lets me buy a purple.
[130:01.01]So I... And thanks for leaving.
[130:02.49]I was... What do you have on you, Stirr?
[130:05.06]A surgical kit?
[130:06.24]Oh, there's a blue right there.
[130:07.36]I hear that.
[130:08.58]Three crunchies.
[130:09.86]Where is it?
[130:10.88]Ow.
[130:11.10]You're going to die to this.
[130:12.62]What?
[130:13.62]Right there.
[130:14.00]You almost died.
[130:14.80]You hit the axe again.
[130:17.90]I would laugh.
[130:18.38]I just gnomed you right now.
[130:19.82]I would say that would be kind of funny, but I hope you don't.
[130:21.60]Alright, yes.
[130:25.02]I got two crunchies.
[130:27.90]So now what are you going to do?
[130:28.88]Are you just... Let's watch.
[130:31.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[130:34.20]Observe.
[130:35.60]Observe not hitting these axes.
[130:36.87]Watch this.
[130:37.27]One.
[130:39.05]Two.
[130:40.29]Three.
[130:40.81]Eat like that every time.
[130:43.64]How does he do it?
[130:44.60]I don't know.
[130:45.16]But there's four people.
[130:46.80]There's three people.
[130:47.66]Four people.
[130:48.10]And I think you're the one versus three, maybe.
[130:52.05]Wait, I hear... Hold on.
[130:57.21]These boxes are in my way.
[130:58.24]Pesky boxes.
[131:02.24]Hmm.
[131:07.78]Does that look funny in third person?
[131:10.25]Yes.
[131:10.73]It kind of does.
[131:12.41]Alright, so there are three people left.
[131:15.54]Are you one of them?
[131:16.82]Like on the little indicator over there.
[131:19.21]Yes.
[131:20.13]Okay, so good luck.
[131:21.35]Where is the indicator?
[131:22.81]We are getting out.
[131:24.13]Above the map, all the filled in little columns or whatever, those are people that are dead.
[131:30.64]So you are the only one.
[131:33.22]Somebody just died.
[131:34.86]Let's go.
[131:36.06]Nuts.
[131:36.82]Awesome.
[131:37.68]That's a dub, boys.
[131:39.24]I'll take it.
[131:40.50]Okay, very important.
[131:43.22]I have 25 of those Valentine's Crunchies.
[131:46.57]Yep.
[131:48.93]this is a big decision because I think I can afford to buy something crazy yeah so that's how I got this axe and I'll tell you it was uh both the best and worst purchase of my life why is that you know like the like gear hoarding syndrome like you get a bunch of gear you just never use it because it's too nice it just sits in your stash yeah that's what I plan on doing
[132:13.25]uh don't do that because we only have a week but we have less than that now so oh but what if I I'm gonna lose it like immediately I would buy this I'm gonna make it back don't don't be silly what should I get treat yourself uh well what's in your merch uh arming sword which is two magic okay so does magic damage work not for you but that this is this is just this is dumb correct
[132:40.55]um let me see let me see so you have arming sword you have a halberd is the halberd 30 or that's 30. have you tried the halberd I'm a fan some people are not though I prefer the one handers I see I see I wish I get the mace yeah but mace is high key trash a lot of times in my opinion what about like uh yeah but does this change well this will change in eight hours
[133:07.94]actually you know what you can do and this is metagaming but I can check my merchant too and you can trade me the candies and I can get you something and I can trade it back that's metagaming I never mentioned that that's a really cool idea but this whole thing has been for you to take these and then leave the call that sounded like an elaborate scam
[133:27.49]I would never see I'll take them I'll take them I'll go spend it and like I'll bring it back and then we I you just you unfriend me on discord and you leave and I never hear from you ever again it's wild that I have this like purple rapier here with uh plus one physical damage plus one additional physical damage and plus one strength like I would never do such a thing
[133:46.20]I think I'll hold it because I probably want to see what else is because I like the one hander.
[133:51.89]I'm not like a rapier fan.
[133:53.79]That's like you like poke, right?
[133:55.11]It's like stab in front.
[133:56.83]It's got some finesse to it.
[134:00.62]It's more than poking, I'd say.
[134:02.90]Do you think I should do it or not?
[134:08.78]Hey!
[134:10.34]He's always gone.
[134:10.86]Uh, what?
[134:12.28]What?
[134:13.20]I was, uh... I was getting a diapy change.
[134:15.74]I had to get the powder.
[134:16.70]My fucking god, you are killing me.
[134:19.57]What?
[134:19.79]Are we going?
[134:23.89]Wait, what's in your store?
[134:26.00]What's in your Valentine's store?
[134:26.80]What were you asking me?
[134:28.20]Why did you need my attention?
[134:30.33]he was asking you if you should trust me then you were you're out there doing adult things I don't all right in my store I'm confused I'll have you know that I I I you got me paranoid the germa paranoia rubbed off on me and I did get some anti-worm medicine wait what yeah I figured you know why not why not just in case
[134:58.25]Hey, facts.
[135:00.91]I love how you don't know even what that is.
[135:02.45]Oh, yeah, yeah, of course, like, you know.
[135:05.49]Of course, who doesn't get anti-worm medication?
[135:13.08]We had a brief discussion about health and wanting to always be cleanly and all that.
[135:18.52]I just inferred it had something to do with that.
[135:20.20]Yeah, a little.
[135:20.90]But I do have no idea, absolutely.
[135:22.70]All just completely flushed straight out into the diaper.
[135:27.32]This is a weird one tonight.
[135:28.52]Hey, man, I'm ready to go.
[135:31.48]You're out here buying weapons.
[135:32.76]I'm just looking at my store.
[135:34.64]No one can kill him, and he just walks around like, what is this game?
[135:39.06]Yeah, but I have to put stuff in my inventory.
[135:41.34]I have to sell the stuff I got.
[135:43.19]Okay, so empty your inventory.
[135:44.93]Okay, let's ready.
[135:46.33]Take off all your clothes.
[135:49.65]Okay, you ready?
[135:51.45]Yes.
[135:52.01]Let's go.
[135:52.43]Look, Ma, no worms.
[135:54.83]By the way, I brought a campfire.
[135:57.25]Oh, good, good, good.
[135:58.48]You can use the campfire not only to heal, but it also replenishes your abilities.
[136:05.43]Yeah, we were going to ask that.
[136:07.07]So is it all abilities or is it just some of them?
[136:09.93]Pretty much.
[136:10.73]It's like a D&D short rest, pretty much.
[136:13.21]Yeah.
[136:14.17]So you get some spell slots.
[136:15.39]It's actually, I'm really glad the whole pork arc happened because now I know that me and my horse don't have worms and I definitely don't have COVID.
[136:25.00]Your horse?
[136:26.30]Wait, hold on.
[136:27.90]Okay, did this just turn into, like, what is going on?
[136:31.50]I need some sort of fill in here.
[136:33.20]Maybe I don't.
[136:34.20]No, here, Stir, can I give him just this quick TLDR?
[136:37.51]That was too deep of a joke.
[136:39.17]I'm sorry.
[136:39.43]Yeah, give him the TLDR.
[136:41.15]So, Stir had a backpack, and he went grocery shopping.
[136:45.77]You know those kind of ready-made but raw meals?
[136:49.22]Like, oh, it's a pork chop and potatoes, and it's just kind of in the grocery store, and you put it in the oven.
[136:53.08]It's like a ready-made thing for you just to put it in the oven.
[136:55.54]Yeah, he left it out for 16 hours accidentally You're gonna want to talk to my wife about that What nah wait I take this that's worth a lot of money she's trying to kill me dude I
[137:12.51]what what yeah actually who who that's not a defrost that's like a that's like a a re re like that's making it wrong and like unhealthy we're going all over like I was just hitting him with the sword all right boys I'm kind of a boxing match there's a guy down here got him
[137:41.56]He's dead.
[137:41.96]He's dead.
[137:42.66]Oh, yes.
[137:43.50]What do you got?
[137:43.98]I actually have to... I have to actually campfire now.
[137:47.69]I have the surgical kit with me.
[137:49.75]Heater shield.
[137:50.53]Survival bow.
[137:52.25]Yeah, I'll trade you the campfire for that.
[137:54.35]I put it down.
[137:54.89]Oh, my God.
[137:55.83]Bless this man.
[137:59.92]Stir, do you want... I have a heater shield from that and a survival bow.
[138:04.31]there's I don't need a weapon you realize if you go if you're going to like we run into a group of three I don't think I need a weapon is what I'm seeing
[138:15.79]uh and look at okay let me move a bit faster while it's holstered okay so you're full healthy all right you're good yep hey jet I would watch the confidence level here because it's so it's so simple to have somebody have an equal amount of good gear on them and be an equally good player and wipe the floor with the whole group I don't think anyone's better than
[138:39.36]Alright, I'm leaving.
[138:43.75]Give me your candy.
[138:46.67]I just got hit twice.
[138:48.21]You wanted to say it so bad.
[138:49.44]Take these, please.
[138:55.88]What's your name again?
[138:57.82]Queslaire?
[138:59.44]It's Qum Queslaire.
[139:02.80]Get educated.
[139:03.98]I want to say it differently.
[139:06.66]That's what I'm saying.
[139:07.48]I know you do.
[139:08.02]Don't say it that way.
[139:09.34]I know, so I had to check myself.
[139:11.44]That's all I'm saying is I checked myself.
[139:13.20]Look, the worms are getting to your brain.
[139:15.89]There's no worms.
[139:16.83]I dewormed.
[139:18.47]Sure you did, pal.
[139:21.73]Oh, friends.
[139:22.15]We got friends.
[139:24.88]Oh god, he's a ranger.
[139:26.34]He's a ranger.
[139:27.04]Stop!
[139:27.56]Stop!
[139:28.56]Stop!
[139:28.88]I just took my horse de-warmer.
[139:30.81]I can't go out like this.
[139:33.09]I'm just gonna hide over here for a second.
[139:34.89]Out like this, dude.
[139:36.25]Please.
[139:37.33]Please, I'm one hit.
[139:38.31]Don't do it.
[139:38.75]Are they coming?
[139:40.81]I'm scared.
[139:41.17]They are preparing.
[139:43.52]Let's actually go for this.
[139:44.70]I don't know how we do this.
[139:45.72]Somebody has to open the door.
[139:46.66]I'm gonna run you.
[139:47.90]I'm running you.
[139:48.88]Alright, now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pot up.
[139:50.98]I'm gonna invis.
[139:52.54]I'm gonna invis.
[139:55.89]And then you just run past me.
[139:57.39]Just run past me.
[139:58.09]I'll fuck him up.
[139:58.71]Okay.
[139:59.69]Here, come over.
[140:01.37]I'm invisible.
[140:02.07]Oh, you're invisible.
[140:02.87]You're screwed.
[140:03.37]Yeah, you're the only one.
[140:03.95]They're turning off lights in there.
[140:04.97]You're the only one.
[140:05.77]I'll turn the lights off, too.
[140:06.69]Fuck that.
[140:07.75]Yeah, yeah.
[140:09.79]Who said you could see?
[140:10.95]They're walking away.
[140:12.57]They walked away.
[140:13.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[140:15.01]No, no, no, no, no.
[140:16.27]Darkness is your ally.
[140:18.79]I was born in it.
[140:21.07]And you, from the darkness, have become blind.
[140:26.99]That's pretty good.
[140:28.43]All right, I can do better.
[140:29.79]Yeah, yep.
[140:31.23]Oh, you think the darkness is your ally?
[140:33.79]My God.
[140:34.65]You see the darkness now?
[140:36.87]I believe that you and I will have a fight in the darkness.
[140:41.69]Bruce Wayne.
[140:44.43]Where's Rachel?
[140:47.79]Where is she?
[140:48.71]They're doing the same thing.
[140:50.21]I just looked over there.
[140:50.89]They're literally doing the same thing.
[140:52.47]Oh, dude.
[140:52.93]Well, they're... The thing is, they're bad.
[140:55.07]We're good.
[140:56.77]There's a difference.
[140:57.69]Actually, I can't see.
[140:58.59]Hold on.
[141:01.27]It was kind of weird.
[141:02.53]I'm going.
[141:05.35]Let's go.
[141:05.61]Go, go, go.
[141:06.05]Let's go.
[141:06.43]Go, go, go.
[141:07.81]Going, going.
[141:10.82]I'm doing alchemy.
[141:14.82]Oh, he froze me.
[141:18.13]Free attack.
[141:20.89]One down.
[141:25.57]It's so dark!
[141:27.18]I don't know where I am!
[141:28.84]Who's alive?
[141:29.52]Oh my god!
[141:32.10]Oh shit, I just hit you!
[141:33.02]I just- No!
[141:34.18]Fuck!
[141:34.64]Sturdy just killed me!
[141:37.34]The darkness is your ally!
[141:38.78]Oh my god, you killed him!
[141:40.36]Sturdy, you just killed me!
[141:42.46]Never turn off the lights again, you troglodytes.
[141:44.56]Holy shit.
[141:46.03]What backwards and not swinging saw you die and you're like, oh it was stir I I didn't dude you hit in the back
[142:05.05]You pervert.
[142:06.05]With your sweet hander.
[142:09.39]Oh my goodness.
[142:10.73]That was so scary.
[142:11.93]I honestly thought you were going to die in there.
[142:15.30]Do you want to camp?
[142:19.42]Yeah, yeah.
[142:21.42]100%.
[142:22.78]Alright.
[142:25.66]I did get a full... I killed somebody in the very beginning.
[142:29.84]I helped and then I may have hit you in the rib cage with the...
[142:34.63]To be fair, the lights were off, and they turned on, and it was just people around me, and I didn't know who was who.
[142:41.02]Oh, you sweet summer child.
[142:42.42]I turned on the light.
[142:43.56]I was holding the torch.
[142:47.42]I was giving you light, and then you hit your ally and then blamed your other ally.
[142:52.02]I thought you were just killing me.
[142:54.15]How dare you turn on the lights?
[142:55.19]That's why I hit him.
[142:56.77]It was the first thing I saw.
[142:57.69]I couldn't see.
[142:59.79]As soon as I could see, I just started swinging.
[143:01.97]What?
[143:04.57]The first thing I did when my vision came back was blindly swing in a circle.
[143:08.25]But wait, there's context behind this.
[143:10.51]I'm sorry.
[143:11.71]There was six people in the same tiny little fucking area.
[143:16.63]And the lights were all off.
[143:18.66]So it's like, I don't know who lived it.
[143:20.26]I know one of them died.
[143:21.52]I didn't know that.
[143:22.10]It's hard to see.
[143:23.06]I know that maybe two of them died.
[143:24.22]When the lights came back on, people are still swinging.
[143:26.00]I'm like, wait a minute, we might be hitting each other.
[143:27.82]I hit you accidentally.
[143:29.16]And then, apologies, I thought Stir was just stabbing me in the face.
[143:33.24]Alright, this is the wrong room.
[143:34.86]Oh, no.
[143:35.66]Not today.
[143:36.28]Not today.
[143:37.72]Oh, but you almost just got wrecked.
[143:39.68]Yeah.
[143:40.20]Oh.
[143:41.24]Yeah.
[143:41.78]Yep.
[143:43.24]I'm just gonna... If I don't turn around quick enough, I will accidentally swing on you.
[143:46.40]But we gotta... I think, if I'm not mistaken... Hold on.
[143:48.96]Let me... Is this kind of loud?
[143:52.62]Is this a little loud?
[143:54.28]No, no, no.
[143:55.18]Is that echoing?
[143:56.40]No, you're good.
[143:57.04]Does anyone hear us?
[143:59.23]Alright, um... Come with me.
[144:02.77]I think... I think there might be... Should I come with you or... Quam with you?
[144:09.23]I was about to be over the... Here we go.
[144:10.91]I was going to go over comms and yell at you.
[144:12.77]I was going to be like, stop team killing, team killing, team killing.
[144:15.58]But that guy would have been like, what is this fucking kid talking about?
[144:19.66]That's a good strategy.
[144:21.22]Oh no, this is awful.
[144:21.98]Alright.
[144:23.60]I followed you to the grave.
[144:25.00]I know, I know.
[144:25.94]It'll be okay.
[144:27.06]You're being dramatic.
[144:27.84]Ow!
[144:29.14]Oh, and here's a cleric trying to get a cheeky kill on me.
[144:34.36]Uh-oh.
[144:39.06]He died to a spike.
[144:39.88]That was beautiful.
[144:41.34]Watch out.
[144:41.70]I dropped caltrops on these stairs.
[144:43.71]Oh, good.
[144:44.37]He almost got you, sir.
[144:47.21]But he didn't.
[144:48.17]It was calculated.
[144:49.73]I don't know where they... Oh, I see them now.
[144:51.35]They're gone.
[144:52.33]This game is so good.
[144:54.11]It really is.
[144:58.28]I don't... Alright, I have these healies.
[145:00.90]Oh, and I have another campfire.
[145:02.46]Can you set this down?
[145:03.11]Because I literally have the interaction speed of a walrus with no flippers.
[145:09.51]Don't ask.
[145:10.71]How long does it take for you... That translates to when you do medical wraps and stuff too, right?
[145:16.11]Yeah, yeah.
[145:16.89]You see this?
[145:17.47]You see this?
[145:19.37]I might as well be rubbing my wounds with sandpaper.
[145:21.89]It's so long.
[145:24.49]I actually haven't measured it out, but...
[145:27.69]Like, what's your resourcefulness level?
[145:30.51]Or your attribute?
[145:31.45]Because mine's 10.
[145:33.63]Oh my god, that's low.
[145:35.72]Yeah.
[145:36.98]Big dumb and big bad.
[145:38.54]Wow.
[145:39.10]32 strength, that's pretty good, isn't it?
[145:43.72]Yeah, it's nuts.
[145:45.68]Do you not like lights?
[145:47.84]What is up with you and turning off everything?
[145:49.74]You are turning all the lights off.
[145:50.72]Once shit goes down, I want to be able to go invisible in a corner.
[145:54.59]You can do that with lights, though.
[145:57.99]Can you?
[145:58.97]Yes.
[145:59.95]You just stealth anywhere.
[146:01.05]This game is super unrealistic.
[146:03.12]Yes.
[146:03.32]As a rogue, not the magical.
[146:07.19]This I'm like wondering why the heck you're turning off.
[146:09.47]I can't see what I'm hitting.
[146:10.85]When you when you interact so quickly.
[146:13.15]Why not?
[146:14.05]Oh, you know, that must be nice.
[146:15.59]Yeah.
[146:15.77]Watch this.
[146:16.07]Watch this.
[146:16.37]Watch it.
[146:16.63]You go turn off one.
[146:17.71]Oh, this is a portal over here.
[146:18.53]Beautiful.
[146:19.77]Oh, no.
[146:20.07]Oh, no.
[146:20.29]These are players.
[146:20.95]Oh, oh, no.
[146:21.69]This is a bad time.
[146:22.38]See, this is where I'm running.
[146:24.18]Now, this makes sense.
[146:25.16]You run.
[146:25.58]I will run, too.
[146:26.98]I'll catch up.
[146:28.00]Yep.
[146:28.18]Yep.
[146:29.46]See, I open that door.
[146:30.22]I can't do that.
[146:33.42]I can close them.
[146:34.12]There's a there's a race in here.
[146:36.73]yeah oh god just just just run just run I must I must save this v hander all right dude yeah oh I shot the door on you lol
[146:56.15]It takes me five years to open this.

[146:57.95]You killed a man today.
[146:59.65]You killed a coom today.
[147:00.57]You killed a coom today.
[147:01.73]I hope you know you did that.
[147:02.45]Do you need it open?
[147:02.87]Do you need it open?
[147:03.69]I can open it.
[147:04.41]No, no, it's too late, dude.
[147:05.87]I opened it.
[147:06.47]It's open.
[147:06.95]It's open.
[147:07.87]Oh, no.
[147:09.31]You killed a man today.
[147:10.77]No, he's dead.
[147:11.39]Stir, you got to go get that fucking axe.
[147:12.87]You killed a man today.
[147:13.73]You killed a man today.
[147:14.89]Stir, you got to go get that axe.
[147:16.53]Don't even bother.
[147:17.63]It's not worth it.
[147:18.37]It's not worth it.
[147:19.71]I can't believe it.
[147:22.15]What are you doing?
[147:23.37]Stir, what have you done?
[147:26.75]Damn it!
[147:27.53]It could have been us.
[147:28.19]That could have been us.
[147:30.65]All you had to do was fight them.
[147:34.09]I'm not a part of this.
[147:39.70]And you know what the worst part is?
[147:40.88]We lost the Zwiehander.
[147:42.68]You lost the Zwiehander too.
[147:44.48]Ah, we lost the Zwiehander.
[147:47.28]Is there anywhere to know where portals are appearing?
[147:51.36]It's random and there's only enough for like one or two of you to get out.
[147:56.71]They are random in this circle, and there's only enough for maybe one more of you to leave.
[148:01.24]There it is.
[148:02.98]Wow, how poetic.
[148:03.88]Two just for us.
[148:04.66]What do you have in your inventory?
[148:06.60]Hey, I'm glad you got out of here with the ancient scroll.
[148:09.96]Where did he go from?
[148:16.39]From all the way back where he killed you?
[148:18.43]Oh, yeah.
[148:20.27]That's amazing.
[148:21.49]Why?
[148:22.70]Oh, well, that was well back to, uh, remember our carry?
[148:27.28]Um, well now you don't have the weapon.
[148:29.62]Okay.
[148:29.86]Oh, that's beautiful.
[148:30.76]I have multiple.
[148:34.10]Wait, you, wait, hold on.
[148:34.94]You have like a whole closet of like Peter Griffin shirts.
[148:38.80]Yeah.
[148:39.36]It's it's yes.
[148:40.02]Yeah.
[148:41.06]Oh, I stay.
[148:41.74]I keep that thing on me.
[148:43.16]Oh, okay.
[148:45.88]All right.
[148:47.02]What do you think this is?
[148:48.40]That's cool.
[148:48.92]That's good.
[148:49.44]Yeah.
[148:49.74]That works.
[148:51.12]Um,
[148:52.16]Yeah, we're good to go.
[148:53.58]Actually, I have, um... Oh, wait, no.
[148:56.12]Wait, you're a rogue, right?
[148:57.86]Oh, God, if you hadn't screwed me over, I have, like, these nice, uh, blue stiletto dagger that I could give you.
[149:02.39]Me?
[149:02.45]The guy who just... What do you mean, me?
[149:07.15]The guy who left you to die?
[149:08.65]What do you mean, me?
[149:10.77]Are you live right now, by the way?
[149:12.68]Yes, yes.
[149:13.28]Just in case people want to see your perspective.
[149:14.64]I'm sorry, I was ignoring you and reading a text message, so I, like, only heard me?
[149:20.38]I, you know what?
[149:21.26]I hope that your horse dewormer was left out for 16 hours as well.
[149:27.36]It almost made me want to throw up.
[149:28.82]So it might as well have been.
[149:31.56]This is a, what an unbelievably strange conversation.
[149:35.65]Um, it's, it's okay.
[149:37.11]What's your, what's your Twitch?
[149:39.23]It's, uh, just Joel's, uh, J U S T J O E L S. So if you want to see the, the, a gamer perspective, they don't want that.
[149:48.62]They don't want that.
[149:49.54]Some people do.
[149:52.28]Some people like games.
[149:56.07]All right.
[149:57.25]Well, that was a fun one.
[149:59.63]I had a good time.
[150:00.23]Yeah.
[150:02.47]Let's go again.
[150:03.71]Yeah.
[150:04.07]Let's run it.
[150:05.85]I have a necklace that I'm going to bring you so we can stay geared up.
[150:11.57]I would recheck your shop.
[150:12.77]Sometimes it does switch up.
[150:14.75]Yeah.
[150:16.63]Even when the timer's not up?
[150:18.22]Yeah, yeah.
[150:18.62]Sometimes it just randomly switches up.
[150:20.12]I don't know why the timer's there.
[150:21.62]I gotta be honest.
[150:23.36]Hmm.
[150:32.81]Uh, it looks the same.
[150:34.57]I'll check it later.
[150:35.21]I'll check it tomorrow, whatever.
[150:36.85]Honestly, I might even be live during this.
[150:39.94]Actually, probably not, now that I think about it.
[150:42.14]We'll see.
[150:43.82]Uh, I'm gonna bring... I'm gonna just bring, like, a decent weapon.
[150:49.04]Yeah, that looks good.
[150:52.47]Uh, I'm not... I don't wanna bring any of my blues.
[150:55.45]I know, I know, don't hoard, don't hoard, don't hoard it, but it's nice to look... Okay, it's nice to be able to open my stash and look at all this money and go, wow, look at that sword, look at those boots, look at that sword.
[151:07.51]Yep.
[151:08.81]Listen to me, German.
[151:09.73]If you don't bring a blue or like multiple blues with you, I'm just going to team kill you when we get in here.
[151:13.45]So the choice is yours at this point.
[151:16.25]Bring the blues or suffer the consequences.
[151:18.98]If you don't bring the blues, I'm going to shut a door in your face.
[151:21.50]What the fuck?
[151:22.80]I'm going to leave your dinner out for 16 hours.
[151:24.40]How about that, pal?
[151:25.40]Okay.
[151:26.36]What if I bring?
[151:29.72]I need you to like strip down when we get in the lobby.
[151:32.19]I got it.
[151:32.49]I got it.
[151:32.77]I got it.
[151:33.23]I'm bringing a good item.
[151:37.12]Two, at least.
[151:39.50]That was the arrangement.
[151:40.58]Okay.
[151:42.24]I do have two good items on.
[151:44.15]This thing is actually really good.
[151:46.19]Whoever gets this, congratulations.
[151:55.93]It's a different colored item.
[151:57.67]It's a different rarity than just the simple, the common.
[152:02.36]Beautiful, beautiful.
[152:03.26]I like to hear that.
[152:04.12]All right, let's go.
[152:06.93]Wait.
[152:08.15]Yeah, let's go.
[152:22.36]Termite ends in a few days.
[152:23.46]Yeah.
[152:27.10]Look, if we don't acknowledge it, it's not real.
[152:29.04]Just.
[152:31.27]People saying that what may is when it might be coming back.
[152:36.00]If they do a fifth playtest, that's kind of wild.
[152:38.46]I don't know what else they would add other than other areas, kind of like in Tarkov, where you have storage, factory, and all that.
[152:44.46]It's going to go into open beta.
[152:47.96]How much is it going to be free to play?
[152:49.66]Are they going to charge for it?
[152:50.70]I wonder what their plan is.
[152:53.10]I would gladly pay money for this.
[152:54.49]If they don't charge for it, I will still pay money for this.
[152:57.11]All right.
[152:59.59]Team Killer, here you go.
[153:02.73]No, you're not Team Killer.
[153:03.71]No, no, no.
[153:04.29]That's not you.
[153:05.55]Okay.
[153:07.31]This is for you.
[153:08.43]I just want to see what it was.
[153:10.57]Hey, how come we're picking up chalices all the time?
[153:12.42]There's a bunch of chalices on this table, but I can't pick up these chalices.
[153:15.36]Hey, Ster, you actually take this.
[153:17.30]Maybe the table's broken.
[153:18.44]Hold on.
[153:21.20]Ster, you're going to want to pick it up.
[153:23.21]That's how you should kind of... Hold on.
[153:25.33]Oh, you brought me the blue.
[153:27.52]Yeah.
[153:28.18]So now he won't team kill us.
[153:29.88]That's what teamwork's all about.
[153:32.25]Teamwork.
[153:34.91]That does a lot more damage.
[153:37.73]Yeah, so that right click, honestly, the stiletto combo is the best combo from what I remember.
[153:42.61]Don't even mess.
[153:44.79]Just that right there, you're going to just wax some ass.
[153:47.34]Hey, try it on my face.
[153:49.40]Yeah, yep.
[153:51.24]I mean, I could try it on a zombie's face.
[153:53.00]We actually probably should go there.
[153:56.40]Oh, this guy's dying for us.
[153:58.16]That's so sweet.
[153:59.88]Oh, what a swell guy.
[154:01.42]Pretty sick.
[154:03.08]Hey, can we start a potion?
[154:04.46]You're a nice guy.
[154:05.76]Lights off real quick.
[154:08.99]Lights off, Andy.
[154:10.33]Honestly, I was kind of upset I could see the game for a second.
[154:14.29]You got to take a cat's eye potion.
[154:17.37]How many subs to take out Jerma?
[154:18.67]100.
[154:18.91]100 subs, I'll team kill Jerma immediately.
[154:21.69]Someone's going to do that.
[154:22.43]I hope you understand.
[154:23.27]That's going to happen in like five seconds.
[154:27.33]I'll do it for 50.
[154:28.52]This is... No!
[154:30.32]No, no, no.
[154:31.02]We're not paying... No, I have nothing to do with this.
[154:39.69]That would be... That would be an unbelievable... And let me tell you something, by the way.
[154:43.69]No, the guy strapped to the electric chair... No, I have nothing to do with this.
[154:47.37]Oh, yeah?
[154:47.67]I don't want to have nothing to do with this.
[154:49.53]I'm going over this right now.
[154:51.25]I got shit for spending 75 bucks on the fucking Family Guy mobile game.
[154:56.02]If you spend 500 bucks on killing me in this game... Excuse me?
[155:02.02]What?
[155:02.34]You think I have fruitless fucking expenses?
[155:05.46]Wait, 75 dollars?
[155:06.52]It...
[155:10.34]Explain.
[155:11.94]That's a bit- that's a bit obsessive, okay?
[155:14.44]It was- But it was- I- I could tap on the houses.
[155:20.71]He could tap on the houses.
[155:23.07]Oh my god.
[155:25.31]Give this guy a mobile game, and he'll give you a hundred dollars.
[155:31.00]Dark and Darkle the mobile game releases tomorrow.
[155:35.48]Inventory management 2.0.
[155:36.40]Oh, Jeremy, I can't believe you spent like 70 bucks on that game.
[155:40.61]That's like what a bad purchase.
[155:42.75]Hey, hey, hey, other streamer.
[155:44.25]Here's 500.
[155:45.10]Oh, Jesus.
[155:48.80]Somebody paid this motherfucker.
[155:50.42]Somebody paid him.
[155:59.81]Did you actually get somebody actually give you I just saw him take you down.
[156:04.81]I just I felt compelled to do it like now.
[156:07.15]Oh my god.
[156:07.59]What have I done now?
[156:08.91]You're alone, and you're not done You're alone, and you've got a really good axe And I hope you got a whole fucking closet of Peter Griffin shirts cuz that one's gone, too Listen, I didn't do it
[156:20.45]For the money.
[156:21.97]I did it for the clout.
[156:23.89]To be able to say that I'm a virtual assassin.
[156:27.98]Yeah, I've got a paid hit job on my record.
[156:30.68]Oh my god.
[156:31.62]Now I have to extract quickly because now I feel bad.
[156:36.56]Well, you also are potentially going against multiple.
[156:40.02]Is this a blue or is this purple?
[156:42.28]Oh, this is a purple.
[156:44.23]You can press tab to inspect my inventory.
[156:45.81]You can see the drip I got on.
[156:47.33]Thank you so much, Disco.
[156:48.49]Oh my god.
[156:50.78]Yeah, watch this, dude.
[156:51.46]Watch this.
[156:51.80]Watch this.
[156:52.32]Oh, so anytime I kill an enemy, I get plus 10 strength.
[156:56.26]Or no, I'm sorry.
[156:56.72]Plus... Yeah, plus 10 strength.
[156:57.84]I'm sorry.
[156:58.30]That's what it is.
[156:58.83]Oh, jeez.
[157:02.75]And then I get a little buff after that.
[157:04.51]It's amazing.
[157:05.53]It really is.
[157:06.21]I can't fucking believe it.
[157:07.71]There was just a literal assassin kill transaction that just played out on the stream.
[157:14.76]That's gonna... That's gonna be a real boon to my virtual assassin business I'm starting.
[157:21.74]What are you going to call your organization?
[157:22.88]In the testimonials, I have, oh, I killed a German 985 in Dark and Darker.
[157:26.90]Yeah, you know, you'll have like a, you have a quote from me, right?
[157:29.96]It's like a, like a little test, like a, oh man, like what the fuck, dude?
[157:33.08]I can't believe you did that.
[157:34.19]And it says like, and then in brackets, really pissed off.
[157:38.55]Yeah.
[157:39.81]It's already being set up.
[157:42.27]I can go take out anyone, anytime.
[157:44.27]Yeah, boys.
[157:51.17]Nice interaction speed.
[157:52.55]Look what you've done.
[157:54.79]Oh no!
[157:55.27]This is the worst room!
[157:56.13]Uh oh.
[157:59.59]Don't do it.
[158:00.15]Don't do it, bro.
[158:00.99]I'm a good boy.
[158:02.75]I'm a good person.
[158:03.61]Hold on, let me turn off the light so I can't see shit.
[158:10.07]Wait, do they actually leave me alone?
[158:17.13]These nerds.
[158:20.70]Maybe they didn't... Maybe they don't know where you are.
[158:31.15]Oh.
[158:31.63]Oh, my goodness.
[158:33.73]Oh, that... Oh, man.
[158:35.39]He just, like...
[158:41.69]I feel for that guy because that's me.
[158:45.35]His future was indeed Ratchet, wasn't it?
[158:47.63]That's me.
[158:48.51]That's me.
[158:49.79]I've been in that scenario like 30 times.
[158:52.84]I feel for that guy.
[158:53.50]I really do.
[158:53.84]All right, let's get out of here.
[158:57.18]I'm scared.
[158:59.72]Just trying to adventure.
[159:01.06]Just trying to get gear and shit.
[159:06.01]I got a lot of loot this level.
[159:09.09]You're dead.
[159:10.37]Some say the loot is the friends made along the way, alright?
[159:15.22]Oh.
[159:15.72]That dude is crying now.
[159:17.68]100%.
[159:17.86]You did get a lot of loot this level, that's right.
[159:20.44]Very profitable dungeon.
[159:21.78]It was a good dungeon for you.
[159:23.08]I got a rock.
[159:34.29]Will you stop hitting me?
[159:35.73]Thank you.
[159:37.35]Good lord.
[159:39.71]Oh, friends!
[159:41.35]Alright, here's the weak strat, watch this.
[159:42.99]I feign weakness, right?
[159:46.01]Look, don't, don't, don't, please, please, no, stop, please.
[159:49.96]Oh my god, please, no, please, god, no, please.
[159:51.80]But you roared, and that's a sign of aggression.
[159:54.46]I don't know if I, I would, I'd probably attack.
[160:06.40]I'm still here.
[160:07.08]I'm still here.
[160:10.68]This is where you have to say, like, your controller unplugged.
[160:14.44]Uh... Step... Steps... Steps is what you're doing?
[160:21.67]I'm stuck.
[160:22.27]I'm stuck in the, uh, the gate.
[160:24.21]Oh my god, these guys suck.
[160:25.63]Sir, have you seen that poke clip?
[160:27.65]Yeah, it was amazing.
[160:28.63]It's so fucking unbelievably funny.
[160:32.52]My controller's unplugged, what the fuck?
[160:41.44]He does it twice, too.
[160:42.68]That's the best part.
[160:43.46]It works two different times.
[160:45.98]Do you see that, dude?
[160:46.80]Do you see that finesse?
[160:47.96]That was actually pretty cool.
[160:52.00]I'm kind of rooting for the zombie.
[160:56.47]That's why nothing you've done today matters.
[160:59.57]I mean, you did kill somebody in cold.
[161:00.97]Oh, Jesus.
[161:05.05]I didn't mean it.
[161:05.51]I didn't mean it.
[161:05.89]I didn't mean it.
[161:06.33]I'm sorry.
[161:06.89]I'm sorry.
[161:07.21]I'm sorry.
[161:15.34]Oh, he shot me with a crossbow.
[161:17.30]What?
[161:17.64]He's a gamer.
[161:19.18]Oh, my God.
[161:20.05]Why didn't you just hit him on the head?
[161:21.43]Because nobody paid me 50 subs for it.
[161:27.15]That's why.
[161:27.63]It's all Chad's fault.
[161:28.79]That's why.
[161:29.27]I'll tell you why.
[161:30.05]There's a whole battle going on after you died, too.
[161:32.01]There was, like, a whole other group.
[161:33.04]I mean, they're going to fight over that, and it's all right.
[161:35.74]Karma.
[161:36.54]You got a whole closet full of those things.
[161:37.92]You're fine.
[161:38.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[161:40.57]I have the bardish now.
[161:42.54]This bad girl, I've been holding on to her.
[161:46.46]Okay, you know what's funny?
[161:48.46]You've got all this really cool stuff, and correct me if I'm wrong here.
[161:52.22]I believe your angle here is, you know, you probably normally would be like, this actually sucks that I'm losing this great stuff.
[161:58.49]But you're like, hey, it's over in three days.
[162:01.21]Literally, that's where I'm at.
[162:02.11]That's where I've been.
[162:03.13]I got you.
[162:03.59]I got you.
[162:04.09]Since I got in this lobby, that's where I've been.
[162:05.81]Okay, I got you.
[162:06.51]Okay.
[162:09.39]Well, it's... Then I'll bring my blue.
[162:12.41]Fine.
[162:12.77]Oh, that's... The blues are standing together, and this is what we need.
[162:16.90]But... Okay.
[162:18.72]I'm bringing one blue.
[162:20.62]But... Creepo, why don't you bring something?
[162:22.92]How about that, pal?
[162:23.66]I don't own anything.
[162:24.88]All right.
[162:25.76]Good thing I brought you a green stiletto.
[162:27.75]Broke-ass bitch.
[162:29.97]Okay.
[162:31.19]I mean, I've got, like, a hundred doubloons.
[162:33.93]Doubloons.
[162:39.08]I don't know.
[162:39.42]Should I buy something from this lonely-looking woodsman?
[162:43.76]Probably not.
[162:44.74]I love the artwork.
[162:47.10]Same.
[162:48.80]Reminds me of Magic the Gathering.
[162:52.38]Okay, who's your favorite character?
[162:54.61]Who would you like to spend a... Like, oh, I'm going to go have a beer with this person.
[163:02.53]Chandra, the Catalyst.
[163:04.47]Oh, wait, wait.
[163:05.01]Magic or... No, no, like in the Travelers and Merchants.
[163:10.92]Dream blunt rotation?
[163:12.74]Oh, okay.
[163:13.24]Okay, mm-hmm.
[163:14.83]Going.
[163:16.53]You go first.
[163:18.05]Yeah, um... I feel like that surgeon has seen some shit.
[163:22.15]I would like to have a beer with him.
[163:23.69]100%.
[163:24.31]Yeah, I can see that.
[163:25.45]What about you, Ster?
[163:29.07]Um... I don't like any of them.
[163:32.80]They all look mean, and the tailor looks the meanest.
[163:35.66]Like, he's gonna sell me some clothes with fucking razor blades in them.
[163:40.44]Yeah, maybe Valentine.
[163:43.47]I want to figure out, you know, how he still has hope in such a hopeless world.
[163:50.17]Can we talk about how the armorer looks like the softest man in the hardest armor?
[163:54.61]Like that man is not intimidating anybody.
[163:58.11]And that is exactly why you should be afraid.
[164:03.15]He's like a baby and like, he's like an armored baby with a mustache.
[164:08.95]Yeah.
[164:09.43]I'm picking the alchemist.
[164:12.20]The alchemist.
[164:13.42]And then... And then I'm gonna like... I'm gonna like text the goblin.
[164:18.24]And just to be like, oh, hey, I've got a plan, like doing some stuff.
[164:21.53]Just to kind of see what he says.
[164:23.71]And then I'd be able to bail.
[164:24.75]Like if it's a weird shit.
[164:27.89]Yeah.
[164:28.53]You're gonna catfish a goblin.
[164:30.39]No, I'm just saying like, hey, what are you up to on Thursday?
[164:33.56]Well, I'm eating flesh on Thursday.
[164:36.72]It's like, okay, no, no, no, no, I'm busy.
[164:40.50]Like, yeah, I'm just getting the... I don't know.
[164:43.94]You wouldn't... Okay, for real, you wouldn't eat some flesh to make a friend for life?
[164:48.70]I feel like at least two or three people here probably have eaten somebody.
[164:53.16]In your chat?
[164:54.30]No, here.
[164:56.52]Oh, I'm going... Statistically, there's a lot of people here.
[164:59.02]Like, maybe three people at least have probably eaten someone.
[165:05.56]I mean, back then, I mean, it probably wasn't, you know, like, in this time.
[165:08.45]All right, I'm bringing a good item, and let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[165:11.71]All right, yep.
[165:13.07]It's weird how the ratio works, because I feel like in my chat, there's probably at least five people that have eaten someone, there's less.
[165:18.59]That's actually, like, how we get inducted in my chat, is we eat people together.
[165:23.41]Interesting.
[165:23.69]You don't do that?
[165:25.07]That's very interesting.
[165:26.74]Sorry, I totally forgot to buy health pots, because I know the minute we get in there, Creepo's going to stab me, so...
[165:32.47]I mean, I'm accepting the fact that... No, never mind.
[165:36.75]I'm not accepting any assassination contracts right now.
[165:41.12]I am booked up.
[165:42.10]And guess what?
[165:42.90]If there is one on me, if you got an assassination contract, one of you, two, just be aware, I'm fighting back.
[165:48.84]I just want you to know that.
[165:50.26]I am not joining the Dark Brotherhood.
[165:53.45]yeah honestly honestly I gotta say like you didn't you didn't do shit when he was just literally stabbing you in your corneas no you really just accepted it you'd look kind of dead stared me or like this is it's happening I wanted you to feel bad I wanted you to be like it's crazy how I don't at all like I really got pushed there and I saw it in your face didn't flinch
[166:20.32]Were you just shocked?
[166:21.22]Like, what was going through your mind at that time?
[166:24.12]We're just playing the game.
[166:25.42]And watch out for the spider behind you.
[166:27.03]Oh, oh, oh.
[166:28.91]Okay, I'm body blocked.
[166:29.93]Okay, I can't move.
[166:35.27]Can you... I dropped a dagger for you.
[166:37.86]Oh, is there one here?
[166:39.64]Yeah.
[166:40.96]I got it.
[166:41.98]Honest to goodness, let's play.
[166:43.92]Let's play, everyone.
[166:53.47]Alright, we gotta kill that.
[166:56.67]We gotta kill the spider spawner.
[166:59.21]Oh, beautiful.
[166:59.95]I can see now.
[167:00.63]I can see now.
[167:01.13]This is huge.
[167:07.05]The dewormer flushed out all of his feelings.
[167:10.22]Yeah, they're in the diaper now.
[167:14.54]Beautiful hop.
[167:15.06]Beautiful hop.
[167:15.88]Exquisite.
[167:16.42]Thank you.
[167:17.52]The worms were what made me, me.
[167:21.72]Oh, that was the good old 1-2 combo.
[167:23.74]Look at that.
[167:25.95]The 1-2 buckle my shoe.
[167:27.37]I love the long sword, by the way.
[167:28.79]It's my favorite weapon.
[167:29.97]I jumped over the corner of this and it's still activated.
[167:32.35]I'm refunding this game.
[167:33.69]That's actually... Oh, you jumped on that like on a trampoline.
[167:37.31]I know.
[167:37.93]I just wanted to... I could have just walked a long way.
[167:40.27]Here's an arming sword for you, by the way, if you want a one-hand.
[167:42.99]There's a wizard in this room.
[167:46.27]Alright, there are friends, uh, directly to our south.
[167:50.19]There's a wizard in the room.
[167:52.58]Oh, wizard.
[167:53.14]Oh, oh my god.
[167:54.32]Okay.
[167:55.90]We can go this way.
[167:57.76]Yeah, I can stun, I can stun him.
[168:07.55]I'll pay you 15 V-Bucks if you kill Stir.
[168:10.45]No, I'm not taking any contracts right now.
[168:13.69]Or ever.
[168:19.27]Boys, if you take health, we can go back to that healing shrine at the beginning of the level.
[168:27.58]Nice hit.
[168:28.04]Nice.
[168:28.38]Nice.
[168:29.14]Whoa!
[168:29.28]That... Okay, I didn't know that was the second part of the swing, where you kind of tip it down.
[168:32.62]You really styled with it.
[168:35.10]Here, I got you a beautiful little helmet.
[168:37.05]Check this out.
[168:38.23]Protect that noggin from facial stabs.
[168:42.17]Alright.
[168:43.43]Pretty good.
[168:44.33]Thank you.
[168:45.35]I'm going down your secret tunnel.
[168:47.59]Secret tunnel!
[168:49.88]There were friends down here.
[168:56.76]Friends.
[168:58.62]Oh, it's all blocked up.
[169:00.16]Right here.
[169:02.32]Oh, I can't even hit it because... Oh, there we go.
[169:08.06]This guy's just standing on the spikes.
[169:10.50]That's so sweet of him to take that damage for us.
[169:14.01]Oh, he killed a player.
[169:14.83]That's so sad.
[169:16.19]Aww.
[169:18.43]Oh, this guy is armored.
[169:19.99]That's not you.
[169:20.47]Watch out for the orb.
[169:21.67]This is really fun.
[169:25.66]I actually really like this weapon.
[169:26.82]Oh, the long sword?
[169:29.18]Yeah, you can block with it and you can get a parry off.
[169:31.88]Stir.
[169:32.48]You want to get this hat that I just put on the ground?

[171:36.40]What the gas?
[171:37.70]Come on.
[171:38.22]Do I have any help for healing?
[171:42.80]There's a healing shrine right behind you.
[171:45.77]Oh, there is.
[171:47.27]I thought somebody used it.
[171:49.95]I was tempted.
[171:51.05]You should probably use it.
[171:52.41]Can you whirlwind or something?
[171:54.03]I have a whirlwind.
[171:55.95]What is this?
[171:58.21]Everybody, just calm down.
[171:59.99]Just calm down.
[172:00.89]I'm thinking.
[172:02.69]Boom.
[172:03.03]There we go.
[172:03.57]Kill him.
[172:07.71]Oh, shit.
[172:10.35]I don't like daggers.
[172:11.11]You're not a dagger guy?
[172:14.35]Fuck.
[172:16.99]They're so short range.
[172:18.85]Yeah.
[172:20.83]Some say it's not the size of the sword, it's the motion of the blade.
[172:24.13]There's a lot of enemies right now.
[172:27.07]Yeah, you guys are getting tons of XP, you know?
[172:33.33]There's a purple Zwiehander.
[172:35.69]No, there's not.
[172:37.20]There is.
[172:37.72]No, there's not.
[172:39.26]Where is it?
[172:39.64]On the floor right here, Zwiehander.
[172:41.20]Redemption Arc.
[172:42.16]No way.
[172:44.46]Where?
[172:45.92]Up on the chest up here.
[172:47.62]Now you can see it, right?
[172:48.85]Holy shit.
[172:49.73]Can you see it when I turn that off?
[172:51.23]Oh my goodness.
[172:55.12]We got any campfires in here?
[172:57.14]I have one on me, yep.
[172:58.38]Here, if you want to take it, because it'll actually take me four years to set it up.
[173:01.65]It'll be 2024.
[173:01.97]Holy shit.
[173:03.19]The beta test will be over.
[173:05.63]This thing is insane.
[173:06.23]Hold on boys.

[173:12.05]Yes, I did.
[173:12.67]Oh, we're fucked.
[173:13.23]Yeah, we gotta get out of here.
[173:16.00]You picked the wrong time!
[173:17.66]Oh, don't you?
[173:19.16]No, come on.
[173:19.78]Oh, sorry.

[173:31.65]Oh, my God!
[173:33.25]The darkness!
[173:33.93]I killed him.
[173:35.09]I killed him.
[173:37.09]Oh, God, dude.
[173:38.35]I was just trying to be the light.
[173:39.73]I'm gonna die.
[173:40.43]No, no.
[173:42.21]No, you're not.
[173:42.87]No, you're not.
[173:43.45]Stay with me.
[173:43.95]Stay with me.
[173:46.40]Dedicated light boy.
[173:48.08]Honestly, if I had taken that torch down, we may have actually lost that.
[173:52.14]Here you go.
[173:52.62]Here you go.
[173:53.22]Take this.
[173:53.70]Well, it's... Only one person here has night vision.

[174:11.74]You do not want this smoke, dude.
[174:13.34]I'm not coming down there.
[174:14.12]Just leave me alone.
[174:15.68]Leave us alone.

[174:54.74]He's going to come around.

[175:05.81]Oh, that's nice.
[175:07.65]Yeah, you should take that.
[175:13.14]Yeah, the strategy was I wanted them to think you were talking to my group and that you were very strong and to not come down here.
[175:20.19]We got it.
[175:20.91]We got it.
[175:21.75]It was clever.
[175:24.27]My knowledge is six.
[175:25.97]In RP, I didn't understand that.
[175:27.79]Somebody asked in chat.
[175:30.61]Out of character, I definitely... Somebody said, what the fuck happened, bro?
[175:36.70]And I was explaining it.
[175:43.04]Alright, I think... Oh, there's two portals here.
[175:45.30]Nice.
[175:45.52]See you later.
[175:47.32]Doozies.
[175:47.90]Oh my god, this is actually crazy.
[175:55.62]Come on.
[175:56.10]You guys are leaving.
[175:57.82]Yeah, yeah, 100%.
[175:58.43]You guys are leaving, huh?
[176:01.03]I got a purple Zwayander, man.
[176:03.15]The Zwayander arc is just beginning.
[176:04.75]I'm sorry, I had to leave.
[176:06.49]No, I understand.
[176:09.21]You're a... What was that movie?
[176:11.77]Uh...
[176:13.19]Oh my god, I cannot believe I'm blanking on this movie.
[176:15.39]There can only be one.
[176:16.07]What's that movie?
[176:16.57]I know you know what I'm talking about.
[176:18.03]There can only be one?
[176:20.59]Yeah.
[176:22.61]What?
[176:24.09]Highlander?
[176:25.31]Yes, the Highlander.
[176:26.29]You're a cardigan now.
[176:27.93]Or a carrigan.
[176:30.96]I'm literally right in front of you, dude.
[176:39.08]How close was he to me?
[176:40.02]Like, honestly.
[176:40.98]I don't know.
[176:42.09]I feel like he was literally right in front of my model.
[176:45.57]That was nuts.
[176:46.99]I don't really know where to go.
[176:48.81]Alright, here's the plan.
[176:49.99]Here's the plan.
[176:50.37]What you're going to do is take the red portal.
[176:52.10]No, I'm just kidding.
[176:55.00]I would take the red portal.
[176:56.08]I just don't want to waste you guys' time.
[176:58.24]No, you don't want to take the red portal.
[177:01.64]I just clicked what kind of just happened in the last five minutes and I just realized what happened.
[177:08.78]Do not do... What are you doing?
[177:10.20]What...
[177:11.25]Why you do this?
[177:12.45]What are you doing?
[177:13.39]What's going on?
[177:14.29]What's he doing?
[177:15.19]He's causing himself damage to cause me stress.
[177:23.73]There's nowhere to go.
[177:25.27]Nothing will rival.
[177:26.33]You literally avoided the circle.
[177:28.42]That was amazing.
[177:31.04]I was just taking a fucking walk around the park.
[177:34.44]Yes.
[177:35.08]Yes.
[177:35.78]We had to.
[177:38.88]Alright, I got another stiletto for you, luckily.
[177:41.36]This is my last one, though.
[177:45.47]No, I'm going to buy you one at this point, though.
[177:48.01]I could buy one.
[177:49.37]I have a short sword.
[177:51.87]I have a blue short sword.
[177:52.81]You could use that.
[177:55.21]I mean, I got a really good short sword from someone in that game, and then I died.
[177:59.05]Well, I have one for you.
[178:00.72]and it was your fault uh okay oops I'm ready what if we all just clicked ready and just went again I I still have gear I'm sorry uh stuff to sell yeah okay well then I'm gonna have to go on some like psycho tangent if we don't go right now oh god oh he's doing it hey hey it's the dewormer oh my god okay just stir just wait a second please I'm just I'm just putting it in I'm just I'm just
[178:27.11]Oster, how do you feel about meatball subs?
[178:28.39]There you go.
[178:29.35]Meat.
[178:30.53]Distract, distract.
[178:31.33]Oh, it's a meatball.
[178:32.19]I like meatball subs.
[178:33.61]Firehouse subs, they make subs.
[178:35.07]They make a meatball sub.
[178:36.03]Sometimes they get their meatball sub.
[178:37.37]It's okay.
[178:38.45]It's pretty good.
[178:39.69]I think a meatball's pretty safe everywhere.
[178:41.67]Most meatballs are too big, though.
[178:44.83]Facts.
[178:45.41]Yeah, I can understand that.
[178:46.73]And there's always the one, like, cartoon spaghetti plate with one giant meatball on it.
[178:52.92]And you know in the center of that meatball is, like, an ice cube.
[178:56.96]That's actually kind of true.
[178:59.62]Interesting.
[179:00.46]Yeah.
[179:00.76]No, I know what you mean.
[179:03.08]I like... You know who... Subway... The Subway Meatball Sub.
[179:07.49]I haven't had it in a while.
[179:08.89]But they have like the perfect sized meatballs.
[179:12.89]They're pretty good.
[179:13.63]My worms really like that one.
[179:19.09]Have you named your worms?
[179:21.25]There's way too many.
[179:23.51]That's huge.
[179:24.38]I'm proud of you.
[179:25.16]It sounds like a healthy colony.
[179:27.68]I mean, if you're looking to lose weight, I've got a couple tips for you.
[179:37.73]You're actually talking to somebody that's very in the nutrition and fucking fitness world.
[179:42.09]Both of you could probably talk to each other and be kind of level.
[179:46.19]Oh, well, my suggestion was to get worms.
[179:48.54]Yeah, well, I prefer just a worm, like a tapeworm.
[179:51.36]That way it's easier to just get that one out.
[179:54.92]But hey,
[179:56.49]I feel like, I don't know, wasn't it a trend for a while to get tapeworms to help people lose weight?
[180:01.57]I hope not.
[180:01.93]That sounds like something that could have happened.
[180:04.08]My big business plan, if I ever really make it and, you know, have some money to invest is uh-
[180:05.08]No, don't let him cook here.
[180:08.92]He's going to talk about having LSD drug chairs at a movie theater.
[180:12.21]Don't let him cook.
[180:14.02]I was going to start talking about putting people in comas for weight loss.
[180:16.02]Alright there's-
[180:17.02]If you're ever just really bored and you're like waiting for the new uh like like a new game to come out and you want to lose some weight just put you in a coma for like a month.
[180:25.02]Eric Cartman did that in South Park.
[180:27.02]Oh, did he? Could you imagine though like like the amount of-
[180:32.02]There's a lot of shit in this room.
[180:34.02]It's like yeah I'm just thinking about like oh yeah hold on all right let me stun him, let me set him. There we go. Just kill him.
[180:41.51]I was just thinking, like, what would they do with all, like, the... Because people in coma, don't they still defecate?
[180:47.41]Like, I don't know.
[180:48.35]I've never looked at, like, the logistics of being in a coma, you know?
[180:53.35]You're going to need, like, a nurse to take care of you.
[180:56.69]Like, could you imagine how many new jobs would be created just from having to, like, handle the waste of people in a coma from that?
[181:01.67]That might be a brilliant job.
[181:03.23]Like, hey, I'm a...
[181:04.96]I'm a weight loss shit technician, basically.
[181:07.12]I didn't let either one of them cook.
[181:08.50]I'm not even in the kitchen right now.
[181:09.74]I'm just saying that, like, Eric Hartman did this for a game console, didn't he?
[181:13.34]You know what?
[181:13.74]You want to know something about you, German, that maybe you haven't noticed?
[181:16.75]Every time I played with you in a group, you shut down everyone else's conversations.
[181:22.49]We're trying to talk about, like, shitting in a coma.
[181:25.75]And you're like, oh, I don't know.
[181:28.84]Ooh, scary.
[181:29.82]Ooh, look out for that, Ster.
[181:31.42]Look out.
[181:31.96]That's my first one.
[181:34.55]Oh, that's true.
[181:36.04]It kind of did catch me off guard.
[181:42.04]Man.
[181:45.18]So, are you saying there's no, like, plausibility, like, like, it's not plausible that you could have a shitting, like, like, profession?
[181:52.26]A shit handler?
[181:52.90]Is that what you're saying?
[181:55.23]I mean.
[181:55.41]It's out of the realm of possibilities?
[181:56.89]I feel like it could happen.
[181:57.91]Anything is possible.
[181:58.59]Oh, check this out.
[181:59.13]Check this out, boys.
[182:00.09]I got a secret tunnel for you.
[182:01.45]Come to, come to Papa's secret tunnel.
[182:03.97]Stand on the square.
[182:06.93]Secret tunnel.
[182:08.09]I'm not doing that.
[182:08.57]It's going to be like a trap door.
[182:10.39]Yeah, I've gone to Papa's secret tunnel before.
[182:12.57]It was not that good.
[182:13.69]Come on, dude.
[182:14.55]Don't be weird.
[182:15.80]Oh, there is actually stuff down here.
[182:19.10]Jesus, we've made it this far together.
[182:20.80]Is it worth it to do the pickaxe stuff?
[182:23.58]I tried it and then I got annoyed when it took so long and I died to a road.
[182:28.54]Does your interaction speed change that?
[182:31.86]In theory, yeah.
[182:33.44]Oh my god, I can see.
[182:40.69]Oops.
[182:44.11]Oh my god, you're waxing him.
[182:45.23]You're waxing him with the long sword.
[182:46.27]Look at this guy.
[182:47.05]Oh my god, look at the finesse.
[182:49.73]I love this thing.
[182:50.37]This thing's actually really fun.
[182:52.13]Isn't it?
[182:52.65]Yeah.
[182:54.17]Oh, look at that.
[182:55.75]That was fun.
[183:00.80]Diamond.
[183:03.94]I'm gonna let the record show that the next time the lights go off and I'm fighting somebody, I'm just not even gonna swing anymore.
[183:11.39]Actually, I got two diamonds.
[183:13.03]Holy shit.
[183:16.70]Don't people do that at nursing homes?
[183:18.22]In theory, yes.
[183:19.24]But I'm saying, like, specifically, like, because you put more people in comas to lose weight, right?
[183:23.26]A lot of people need to lose weight or want to lose weight.
[183:25.38]You're gonna have a large amount of shit on your hands.
[183:29.01]Literally.
[183:29.27]Literally.
[183:30.83]Well, I'm typing in the group chat.
[183:31.81]There's just one guy who's the shit guy.
[183:33.73]Yeah.
[183:35.35]I'm typing in the group chat, guys.
[183:36.99]Excuse me.
[183:40.41]Oh, here we go.
[183:41.93]Oh, goodness.
[183:42.97]I forgot to... Oh, wait.
[183:43.94]There we go.
[183:44.76]There we go.
[183:45.94]I forgot to put a question mark at the end of that.
[183:49.16]Here we go.
[183:52.60]Look, Jerma, I'm sorry for everything.
[183:54.34]No, no, no.
[183:55.26]Kraken was asking of how many we had.
[183:59.04]Dude, I'm sorry.
[184:02.60]Be better.
[184:03.24]Then be better then.
[184:04.22]Prove it to me.
[184:04.68]Be better.
[184:05.52]He's trying to replace me right now.
[184:07.04]Be better then, okay?
[184:08.48]I'm sorry.
[184:09.20]I didn't bring up the poop thing.
[184:10.46]He did.
[184:10.76]All right.
[184:14.14]You got a jump crowd?
[184:15.26]Okay.
[184:15.80]Okay.
[184:18.00]To be fair.
[184:19.32]Yeah, I totally brought it up.
[184:22.12]No.
[184:22.48]Ster can't get kicked from the guild.
[184:23.86]He's the leader of the guild.
[184:24.92]As much as we want him out of here, he's the one that put the kick power.
[184:30.39]You can't escape.
[184:34.65]Oh, oh, oh, this is the big room.
[184:35.95]Let's go.
[184:36.47]Oh, we're about to make some money today.
[184:40.83]Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.
[184:44.36]That move is so good.
[184:47.46]The fear of your longsword.
[184:50.12]Whatever that like stun, whatever it is.
[184:51.20]Does that work on players?
[184:51.96]Oh, yeah.
[184:52.90]No, I wish.
[184:53.80]Oh, my gosh.
[184:54.22]Could you imagine the carnage?
[184:55.61]That'd be insane.
[184:56.13]That would rain down upon these servers.
[184:58.05]Do you know what would happen to these people?
[184:59.79]It would be a stun and then a kill.
[185:02.39]They wouldn't play anymore.
[185:04.11]I got three diamonds.
[185:04.85]Gamers, gamers, gamers!
[185:06.31]No gamers!
[185:07.17]Oh, Jesus!
[185:13.06]Let's talk this through, boys.
[185:13.98]Let's talk this through.
[185:14.74]Let's talk this through.

[189:10.29]Because at the end of the day, that's all that matters to me.
[189:12.31]Well, so there's a, there's a chest piece that's 61 armor.
[189:18.14]It's cloth though.
[189:20.40]And it's two weapon damage, max health and spell casting, which doesn't matter.
[189:25.12]Right.
[189:25.75]Or I could get, no, that's 30.
[189:26.81]It's got bad rolls on it.
[189:29.25]Mm-hmm.
[189:31.43]The long sword you had had plus four physical damage and 1.5 action speed.
[189:36.91]This is kind of a god roll on a blue.
[189:41.96]Yeah, I think... You're going to keep it?
[189:44.26]No, no, no.
[189:44.74]I can't even use it, but I'm going to give it back to you.
[189:46.72]This thing's nuts.
[189:48.40]And you were rocking with it.
[189:50.09]Yeah, this thing would be amazing.
[189:56.64]So, this sword versus the purple I have, this is plus 2 agility, 2 resourcefulness, a little bit of interaction speed, and 53 damage.
[190:04.96]What's the one that I have right now?
[190:08.09]57 free will, max health, and item speed.
[190:13.07]It's probably always just damage, isn't it?
[190:17.35]For the...
[190:19.36]Variation on the Zweihander?
[190:21.78]Yeah, like which, like... So I have one as well right now.
[190:25.14]Mine's weapon damage 55, plus two knowledge, plus two weapon damage, plus three move speed.
[190:30.67]Spear is nice too, people are saying.

[191:46.06]So now I go to merchant.
[191:52.42]So the spear, this thing is really, really good.
[191:56.36]Yeah, and I gave you the additional candy because I want you to try the spear.
[192:00.10]It's not for everybody.
[192:01.04]I will tell you that right now, but...
[192:03.37]You'd have to be a troll of the night not to use it effectively.
[192:06.12]Whoa.
[192:06.96]Okay, let me... Whoa, dude.
[192:08.82]Yeah.
[192:09.06]I got it.
[192:09.58]I know, I know, I know.
[192:12.08]Is that good?
[192:12.76]I got it?
[192:16.02]Yeah, I mean, I would run the spear.
[192:17.91]I would run it.
[192:18.47]All right.
[192:19.09]Let me put it on.
[192:21.63]And if you hate it, then it wasn't my idea.
[192:24.13]All right.
[192:24.87]Okay, this is... I'm playing this one.
[192:26.95]No, I'm not going to, like, go over voice chat and be like, It's me!
[192:30.07]I say!
[192:30.53]No, I'm not losing this.
[192:32.88]I don't know, where is your voice chat key?
[192:34.92]Because you didn't even move to avoid the attack.
[192:37.12]Is it like the plus and minus button?
[192:40.96]What did you have to press to do that?
[192:43.12]Well, I wanted them to kill me.
[192:47.15]I wanted us to be yelling at you, and they take the opportunity to kill me.
[192:51.65]And then they have a story for the rest of their life.
[192:55.89]That is so sweet of you.
[192:58.90]I guess I'm just not content-minded.
[193:01.20]I'm too smooth-brained for that.
[193:03.18]What's your new player name?
[193:04.82]I put it in Discord, SirDipey.
[193:07.66]Nice.
[193:09.12]Oh, that's your actual name.
[193:12.44]What are you on that tonight for?
[193:14.66]I'm on that always.
[193:15.98]Dipey has been one of my new favorite words.
[193:20.05]Foraging for food, pretty good.
[193:25.37]Is that a perk?
[193:25.97]Is that a perk?
[193:28.69]I run the sharpshooter.
[193:29.67]I run the headshot one for my first one.
[193:31.86]No, not the perks.
[193:33.56]The skills.
[193:34.70]Yeah, heal 25 when you forward.
[193:38.02]Goaded.
[193:38.58]Do not take that off.
[193:43.40]So... Let me go into... I also am bringing you an arming sword and a short sword.
[193:52.61]I'm bringing you a short sword.
[193:53.59]So don't...
[193:54.97]I guess you can't even buy anything.
[193:55.87]You're a brand new character.
[193:57.23]I'm brand new.
[193:59.07]Should I just buy... If I'm going to have the spear on, should I buy anything like armor or are we just going to go for it?
[194:06.37]You said this was a real gamer one.
[194:08.45]Yeah, so in theory, if you're going to run... Because like barbs can get away with being lazy and just having a weapon.
[194:15.60]You cannot.
[194:16.34]You need a kit.
[194:18.38]But then again, armor slows you down.
[194:21.20]So if you want to run faster, you might want like a, you know, leather kind of thing, or like a padded situation.
[194:27.08]I'd like to take, um, yeah, I want to be able to take some hits.
[194:29.40]I'll get a few things.
[194:29.96]So what I would say is I would check like, and just, if you have any greens in the shop, definitely go for that first.
[194:36.34]Uh, but just make sure the attributes make sense.
[194:38.42]And if not, then don't worry about it, honestly.
[194:40.82]And I can check my shop too.
[194:42.04]Just magic resistance, interaction speed, armor, headshot protection.
[194:45.76]Oh, Vinny.
[194:46.44]Thanks for the raid.
[194:46.90]I just saw a vine sauce.
[194:49.86]Thanks, Vinny.
[194:50.58]Thanks for playing earlier, too.
[194:51.42]Yo, Vinster.
[194:53.16]Thank you, Vinny.
[194:55.00]Welcome, everybody.
[194:55.88]We're just kind of playing the game.
[195:01.07]Okay.
[195:02.41]Well, I'll find other stuff, too.
[195:04.39]It was 10 minutes late.
[195:06.13]All right.
[195:07.47]Let's actually try to win this one.
[195:09.81]Because I got to.
[195:11.53]I don't want to lose this thing.
[195:12.19]Where's Sir Diaby's shirt?
[195:13.57]That's what I'm wondering.
[195:16.02]Should I put a shirt on?
[195:17.38]I mean, I just wondered where it went.
[195:21.05]I mean, when you got a body like this.
[195:23.33]Facts.
[195:23.91]I'm ready.
[195:24.58]All right.
[195:24.86]So that's my body.
[195:25.76]My body is ready now.
[195:26.62]All right.
[195:26.88]Let's go.
[195:27.36]Let's go.
[195:27.88]Let's go.
[195:35.20]Ready up.
[195:37.33]Sir.
[195:39.83]Aren't you like not ready?
[195:41.39]I was waiting for you to be ready.
[195:43.67]Oh.
[195:45.51]I got.
[195:46.05]Oh, my God.
[195:46.51]I got the best thing for you.
[195:50.20]Don't mess this up for me.
[195:51.86]The ranger portrait doesn't look like he's drawing an arrow.
[195:54.71]It looks like he's sniffing something.
[195:58.27]There you go.
[195:59.43]Facts.
[196:00.21]True.
[196:01.19]This man's spitting.
[196:04.15]I'm going off for a smoke.
[196:06.91]Good luck.
[196:16.24]All right, let's clear comms.
[196:19.43]Let's play.
[196:20.69]Yep.
[196:21.09]Here you go.
[196:21.67]Take this.
[196:24.25]This is for you.
[196:25.81]Oh, my goodness gracious.
[196:27.87]Yep.
[196:28.35]Take that.
[196:28.99]Why did I just hear myself?
[196:29.93]That was weird.
[196:30.41]I think you did voice chat in game.
[196:35.67]Oh, I did voice chat, and it's probably using my whole ass.
[196:44.21]different hold on I'll be here for a moment your desktop audio is coming through that is so funny you listed it as your input device that's brilliant that's such a his whole do that well I don't think there's a way to change your audio channel wait there is you'd have to go to maybe default in windows first I can't oh rough yikes um
[197:16.64]I guess we're going to have to be super gamers.
[197:19.10]This thing is fun.
[197:20.18]Let me make sure.
[197:22.48]You feel the power now?
[197:23.34]You feel the power of the perp?
[197:24.64]Yeah.
[197:25.96]This room is kind of awful, but... It's literally the worst.
[197:29.53]There's a bunch of skeeters here.
[197:30.69]I don't like mosquitoes on by you, but... Oh, he's just turning around.
[197:33.77]Yeah.
[197:34.27]Yeah.
[197:36.27]I really appreciate that.
[197:37.15]Yeah, what's the... What's the range?
[197:39.07]Oh, my God.
[197:40.31]She's got some range on her.
[197:41.81]Hold on.
[197:42.21]Watch out.
[197:43.45]I'm watching.
[197:44.35]How far is it?
[197:44.91]Oh, close.
[197:45.45]Close.
[197:46.94]close oh that's look at that that is actually pretty far damn oh yeah we can yes yes yes okay we can also hear ourself again too could you wait really yeah I heard you coming through him no he talked I talked as well oh you talked okay oh okay okay all right
[198:12.14]That is a trap that yeah, that's a trap room and you have to have to you have to pick pocket to get that so don't even bother but kill these guys these guys usually have a Penance
[198:24.69]What?
[198:25.73]Oh, you just hit me.
[198:26.65]Do I have to re... Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out!
[198:29.26]Don't die, don't die!
[198:30.76]Dude, this is a real gamer one, dude.
[198:33.58]I think you hit me with your axe.
[198:35.08]I think I did.
[198:35.46]I didn't, I didn't.
[198:36.66]No, it was me, it was my fault.
[198:38.08]I fired one arrow, and it is inside this skull.
[198:41.97]But good news is, you have second wind, and we also get a campfire from the ranger, so everything's fine.
[198:45.69]I didn't do anything wrong.
[198:46.55]No, no, we're good, we're good.
[198:48.07]No, we're good.
[198:48.61]We're good.
[198:49.43]Do any of you guys have any issues?
[198:50.63]Oh wait, there's a health thing over here.
[198:51.84]Sorry, what?
[198:52.18]Ah, shit.
[198:53.14]Where you're crouching and it wants you to press F to interact and you can't do both.
[198:57.94]Hold on, watch out!
[198:59.34]German, no!
[199:00.34]German, no!
[199:00.74]What's going on?
[199:03.60]Skelly!
[199:04.36]Skelly champion!
[199:05.20]Where did he come from?
[199:05.92]Can we kill this?
[199:07.18]Yeah, we can kill it.
[199:07.72]We can kill it, but don't die.
[199:09.24]We can kill it if you don't die.
[199:11.22]If that makes sense.
[199:12.54]I think that makes sense.
[199:16.18]I've run the numbers, and if you don't die, we can kill it.
[199:21.86]Oh my god!
[199:22.60]I have my fear again in a second.
[199:30.44]That's a lot of enemies, friends.
[199:34.94]I don't really know how my character works yet.
[199:37.54]Okay, hold on.
[199:38.06]I'm fearing him away.
[199:40.04]Take this time to run.
[199:40.78]Take this time to run.
[199:42.52]I'm dead oh my god oh my god I died oh I actually died I I don't know what I was doing I don't know why I did that I thought I thought because you said you feared him I was like okay they feared I can I can take this and run oh my god oh my god this is the worst ever no that's bad that's really bad I thought I had time that's the problem
[199:59.34]Oh, no.
[199:59.76]Start shooting the champion with the arrows, the bow.
[200:02.15]Is that the purple bow or the black bow?
[200:03.53]I am.
[200:03.63]I don't want to hit you because German's going to say that I hit him.
[200:06.33]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[200:07.47]It's okay.
[200:07.81]It's okay.
[200:08.19]Everyone relax.
[200:08.81]Good comms.
[200:09.27]Team comms.
[200:09.71]Team comms.
[200:10.73]I just thought that everybody was feared over there and I was like, I have two or three seconds.
[200:14.61]He's on me.
[200:16.25]I'm going to walk up here and I'm going to lay a trap.
[200:18.21]And what I'm going to do is I'm going to swing on his ass.
[200:21.49]Come here, baby.
[200:23.11]Oh, we gotta get Jerma's spear.
[200:25.31]Oh, Jesus.
[200:26.39]No.
[200:31.83]This is a bad run.
[200:33.07]This is not a good run.
[200:34.87]This is a very bad one.
[200:45.81]Okay, you know- you know how- alright.
[200:47.26]Do you know how shit- That's a real gamer one.
[200:49.58]Do you know how shit just, like, falls apart and you kinda just don't even know how or why?
[200:54.88]That, like, I don't even know what happened.
[200:58.78]Like, it just fell apart so quickly.
[201:01.35]It was just abrupt chaos that we just couldn't fucking solve.
[201:07.42]Once it started going, it just wouldn't stop, man.
[201:11.75]It's just like, oh, there's a heal over there.
[201:13.39]Oh, it's okay.
[201:13.95]We have like five aggroed.
[201:16.63]That's 10.
[201:17.85]I think I can get this heal off.
[201:18.89]And then it's just, it's over.
[201:20.03]Like the whole thing just falls apart.
[201:22.73]And I got, it's okay.
[201:25.11]I still got this Wander.
[201:27.52]You caused that?
[201:29.08]No, what caused it was the champion, big champion skeleton existed.
[201:34.16]And we didn't all just run away at the same time.
[201:38.80]The guild is fucking falling apart.
[201:41.20]I hate this guild.
[201:42.22]I'm going to go get water because you guys are going to like re-ready your characters for another 20 minutes.
[201:47.24]Can you tell me who the fuck you're working for, Jerma?
[201:50.33]Who hired you to ruin my barb legacy, huh?
[201:53.25]You don't have any subs I got for that one.
[201:55.07]You don't have any ideas?
[201:58.28]zero oh my god oh I still have five purples let's go okay actually I I do need to pee I don't get some water yeah yeah yeah yeah oh hey at least it was funny no no it's hilarious it was all my fault do I take the l on this one
[202:17.40]I would say I didn't comm that there was a Skelly champion coming soon enough for you.
[202:22.26]I didn't recognize that he was aggroed on you.
[202:23.84]I thought he was on me.
[202:25.02]And I will take the blame initially.
[202:27.52]After that, everything was you.
[202:33.08]Respectful.
[202:35.90]It was fun, though.
[202:36.96]That's all that matters.
[202:38.28]No, I had a great time.
[202:38.88]It was fucking hilarious.
[202:40.12]Yeah, I demoted you in the guild hall.
[202:43.71]You don't have access to guild stash anymore, man.
[202:46.01]That's fine.
[202:46.49]I already cleaned the bank out before you did that.
[202:51.48]Take a look at all this.
[202:53.72]I mean, you're still in the guild.
[202:55.80]Take a look at all this.
[203:00.01]Okay, yeah, I'll bear it back.
[203:00.87]I gotta pee.
[203:06.67]Beer pee.
[208:16.17]Hello?
[208:17.19]Anybody there?
[208:19.93]How are we?
[208:21.30]Hello, hello, hello.
[208:21.82]All right.
[208:24.20]Well, that was good.
[208:26.22]That was a decent warm-up round.
[208:29.82]Yeah, I think we're going to kill it now.
[208:31.78]How are you guys doing on time?
[208:34.70]I will be playing this until 5 a.m.
[208:36.50]I kid you not.
[208:41.95]What about Mr. Stirr?
[208:44.42]I think he's... Let's go.
[208:45.72]I'm honest to goodness.
[208:47.16]Let's play.
[208:47.98]Okay.
[208:50.52]Stir, how are you on time?
[208:52.54]Are you good for a little bit longer?
[208:54.19]I'd say I got like a week left before the worms take me.
[208:57.63]Well, I mean, like tonight.
[209:00.81]Oh.
[209:01.65]I don't know.
[209:04.77]Okay.
[209:06.12]I'm in it till I'm not.
[209:07.86]Okay.
[209:08.12]Honest to goodness.
[209:09.66]Now, I might make a suggestion.
[209:11.86]I can keep on going, Barb, if you'd like.
[209:14.40]I can also play Cleric if you guys wanted to get some more action, a little bit more blood on your swords and whatnot.
[209:24.24]I would like to be a ranger behind your big axe, though.
[209:27.02]No, I understand.
[209:27.54]I'll keep axing.
[209:30.08]Because otherwise our frontliner is the guy who like comedically turns around to talk to us.
[209:34.80]And I can't trust that.
[209:36.47]Yeah, but that's... It's funny though.
[209:40.03]One time.
[209:40.93]It is, but like my life depends on it.
[209:45.07]Understandable.
[209:46.15]Get in there with your big axe.
[209:48.35]Hey, let me get 50 subs to stab my friend I'm streaming with in the head till he dies.
[209:53.00]Dude, like... But it's me.
[209:54.90]It's me.
[209:56.52]That's the comedy one.
[209:57.92]I didn't start that.
[210:02.88]There was someone asking for 100 who wasn't me first.
[210:05.80]That's true.
[210:07.12]That's very true.
[210:07.98]Again, a lot of this isn't actually me.
[210:11.72]You just capitalized on it.
[210:13.20]You just capitalized on it.
[210:14.17]All right.
[210:14.39]You guys ready?
[210:15.49]Yeah.
[210:16.89]Fuck the communists.
[210:18.21]All right.
[210:18.43]Let's go.
[210:19.27]That's what I've always said.
[210:20.61]Exactly.
[210:21.25]Honest to goodness.
[210:21.97]Let's go.
[210:27.79]Dude, are you still mad, dude?
[210:28.99]Are you still sulking?
[210:30.47]Everybody in this lot.
[210:31.70]Damn it.
[210:33.83]You don't even have time to talk shit.
[210:35.92]Yeah, usually I tell them I'm going to kill everybody and then I didn't get to do that today.
[210:40.28]So this might be a scuffed run.
[210:46.52]I think we're going to be fine.
[210:50.53]I like your way of thinking.
[210:52.57]Beware of interlopers.
[210:54.11]Honest to goodness, we're going to be fine.
[211:00.57]Alright, I'm the commanding officer on this mission.
[211:02.91]Leave the fucking lights on so I can hit sh- Oh wait, you have no reason to turn off lights now.

[211:44.41]Like, that's exactly.
[211:45.87]Good on you.
[211:46.31]Seriously.

[211:55.67]Exactly what I was talking about.
[211:57.11]You deserve it.

[213:20.79]Talk to them.
[213:21.17]Talk to them.
[213:21.77]No.
[213:22.05]That way I can laugh while I'm dying.
[213:24.33]We should mute Discord and only talk in-game.
[213:26.29]Oh, that's brilliant.
[213:29.63]I'm down.
[213:29.95]I want a roleplay round.

[215:27.25]Hello?
[215:28.69]Oh, good thing I can hear you now.
[215:32.65]Greetings for our first adventure.
[215:34.23]Hello, can you hear me?
[215:36.61]I am speaking.
[215:37.39]Have a wizard.
[215:39.23]Let's ask for the wizard.
[215:42.41]Great, good to speak.
[215:47.62]Spiders.
[215:49.46]We have to take out the jaw.
[215:52.21]Yeah, the jar in the corner is the way to stop the spider.
[215:57.23]Be careful behind you.
[215:59.71]Oh, very interesting.
[216:03.21]I'm glad you've told us that.
[216:05.22]More than five times today.
[216:06.90]Are we ready to continue down this hallway, please?
[216:12.00]Listen to me, boys.
[216:12.58]Listen.
[216:21.21]Why do I sound so smart?
[216:22.49]Anyways, there's exquisite leaders over here in the library.
[216:25.37]Come here.
[216:26.03]Come here.
[216:27.15]Oh, the library, yes.
[216:29.82]Plenty of books.
[216:34.00]I remember reading this one.
[216:36.44]That's a good one.
[216:37.56]This is an encyclopedia of all the dragons that are in this world.
[216:41.67]Have you read it?
[216:42.17]The dragons?
[216:47.01]I can't believe it.
[216:49.85]Despite my upbringing, I can't read.
[216:52.15]Those of mage, we must go for a fight to loot.
[216:55.13]Mage here.
[216:58.61]That's nice, nice.
[217:08.24]Excellent, excellent blow, Meade.
[217:10.38]Excellent blow.
[217:11.12]Crystal sword here.
[217:13.97]It was top draw, if I must say.
[217:21.49]I go over here.
[217:22.01]I'm gonna get the spider.
[217:24.89]Interlopers, you say?
[217:26.05]I need to get rid of the... Sir Diopay, what are you talking about?
[217:43.55]Make sure you get the jewels.
[217:53.58]Turn oblivion music on?
[217:55.24]Okay.
[218:08.83]Jesus Christ!
[218:12.93]Ow!
[218:14.57]What the fuck?
[218:16.29]Oh my god, why was it like that?
[218:18.58]Oh my god!
[218:24.27]Oh my goodness.
[218:27.72]Sorry, a very loud thing happened.
[218:31.78]I see, I see.
[218:39.44]Why is it so loud?
[218:42.07]I don't get it.
[218:45.65]Shit, what's so loud?
[218:48.91]Spikers dealing with demons of the mind.
[218:54.97]All right, gentlemen, I'm ready.
[218:57.93]Gentlemen.
[218:58.35]I'm working on it.
[218:58.87]All right.
[218:59.11]Are we ready to take off?
[219:00.59]Here we go.
[219:00.87]This way, follow me.
[219:28.06]Long ago, this exact cave was filled with treasures, laughter, music, family.
[219:37.76]You've been here before?
[219:39.14]Yes, many times.
[219:40.10]This is my home.
[219:40.90]You've been here recently.
[219:42.92]Very recently.
[219:45.02]But now, ever since the Dragonfire, it's all but nothing.
[219:55.33]Thankless.
[219:56.07]Footsteps in the distance.
[219:57.57]The dark.
[219:59.63]Bounds upon the cement.
[220:02.21]I don't know what could be in these halls, but... Prepare for anything.
[220:11.96]Wait a minute.
[220:13.80]Alas.
[220:15.35]A room full of treasures.
[220:17.63]Oh, yes.
[220:18.51]I just remembered.
[220:19.79]What is it?
[220:20.13]I left my oven on.
[220:21.73]There be an archer.
[220:23.31]Watch out.
[220:24.76]It'll get you outside.
[220:27.66]What have they done to my father's old study?
[220:32.52]These absolute disgusting zombies.
[220:37.24]It's probably too dangerous in here now.
[220:42.36]Don't get too close.
[220:45.28]You had a family.
[220:47.44]That's correct.
[220:47.98]I don't know why you're saying these things.
[220:56.79]This way.
[221:00.95]Long ago, my father created a series of traps to protect this very room and these very halls from interlopers.
[221:11.82]Like us.
[221:13.28]It's ironic considering that we're trying to... Yes, it's very strange.
[221:24.20]I just... If you want shoes, I want to feel the cold stone on my bare feet.
[221:35.45]Curious.
[221:38.45]Very curious indeed.
[221:41.83]Trying to get to my old room.
[221:46.61]Unfortunately, it's been destroyed.
[221:48.06]I did, many years ago.
[221:54.42]Skeleton.
[221:55.14]Skeleton.
[221:55.78]Oh my neck!
[221:56.64]Ow, my neck!
[221:57.00]Please help!
[221:57.92]Ow!
[221:58.28]Oh!
[221:58.58]Oh, that hurt.
[221:59.65]Attack, please!
[222:24.04]Never mind, we're not going down there.
[222:27.46]Sidiope!
[222:31.58]Sidiope!
[222:35.43]It's very scary coming down these halls once again.
[222:40.53]Sidiope, what's happening?
[222:45.23]Hey, adventurer friend, what are you doing?
[222:47.61]Stop, stop, stop!
[222:49.11]Do you have a history in these halls as well?
[222:55.04]I must know if there are other people here.
[222:57.76]My family depends on it.
[223:03.52]Wizard!
[223:06.76]Wizard!
[223:09.40]Oh, another one lost to the dungeon.
[223:13.33]Where did that wizard go?
[223:19.23]There was a wizard here and he might have the secrets of my family.
[223:22.43]It could even be somebody from my family.
[223:25.88]We must know.
[223:26.48]We must define.
[223:30.95]Hello?
[223:31.29]Wizard, it's all right.
[223:35.15]He's a blacksmith.
[223:39.71]He built this entire castle with his bare hands.
[223:43.61]I don't want to... He was paid very well.
[223:54.92]Unfortunately, he didn't make it through the war.
[223:58.03]The war, he did not make it through the war.
[223:59.67]Ventra, do you have business in these halls?
[224:01.63]There would be, potentially.
[224:04.05]How did you get in?
[224:17.85]Another adventurer, please!
[224:18.87]Let us all come together and discuss what's happening here.
[224:22.01]I'm trying to find my family's secrets.
[224:25.27]It's...
[224:47.92]A blue portal has arrived.
[224:51.82]All right.
[224:52.16]If there are any interlopers here in my family's castle, just be aware I am not going to go down so easily.
[224:59.06]My father built this tunnel, built these halls with his bare hands, just so you know.
[225:04.01]I am ready to fight for my family and for what they have built and what they have done.
[225:09.03]Do you understand?
[225:10.69]Are you friend or are you foe?
[225:20.23]He's a friend.
[225:20.95]He's a friend.
[225:21.65]He's a friend.
[225:22.09]Let him be.
[225:25.29]Look into the fire and tell me what your name is.
[225:28.41]Stop.
[225:28.81]Stop.
[225:29.23]Stop.
[225:29.83]Stop.
[225:30.65]Stop.
[225:33.41]You violated the law.
[225:35.43]Stop.
[225:35.91]You violated the law.
[225:36.81]Pay the penalty or rot in prison, scum.
[225:41.17]Stop.
[225:43.72]Stop.
[225:46.78]I love you.
[225:48.34]You bitch!
[225:54.86]Oh, shit.
[225:57.71]What do I do?
[225:58.33]I don't... There's no adventurers to talk to.
[226:00.71]There's no players to interact with.
[226:05.25]What happens when an NPC has no... Can you hear me?
[226:09.15]It is me.
[226:10.50]Why can I still hear you?
[226:11.66]And why did you say your name correctly instead of the French way?
[226:17.50]Sorry for what you had to see.
[226:19.10]Why can I hear you?
[226:19.82]Just know that I will always love you.
[226:21.46]Why can I hear you?
[226:26.16]I'm always with you.
[226:29.79]Bitch, you didn't get any of those high five hits on me because you suck.
[226:41.35]Is there anyone left?
[226:45.78]Is there anyone left?
[226:48.93]Please tell me there's someone left.
[226:54.26]Someone.
[226:55.42]A final adventurer, perhaps.
[226:58.12]A final adventurer to talk to me and give me one final quest before I die.
[227:02.19]Please, give an old man something.
[227:19.90]I made it.
[227:20.26]I didn't make it.
[227:30.33]I didn't make it.
[227:35.89]Don't you tell me you just died in the darkness.
[227:38.26]I was trying.
[227:38.82]I was hoping somebody was going to show up and be like... Because there were two people left.
[227:47.40]I can hear you through it.
[227:50.85]There's a lot of audio jungle.
[227:52.65]That is a better one.
[227:57.19]Also, your mic, uh, it might be like a webcam mic or something.
[228:01.65]I could not understand a word that Quom Cuzzler was saying.
[228:05.69]I couldn't either.
[228:07.59]I heard like, I heard like, like something about like hot pockets in the... I didn't say hot pockets once.
[228:15.30]You didn't say hot pockets?
[228:17.86]No.
[228:18.96]Who said they were eating a hot pocket?
[228:24.93]Bro, I was... I literally... I roleplayed and I forgot that I was a girl in the game.
[228:30.35]And I just was like midway through, I just formed a romantic relationship with you.
[228:34.50]At no point did I say Hot Pockets.
[228:36.76]Your microphone was... It was so funny because it was... I don't... The people that we were interacting with, I don't think I could hear what you were saying.
[228:44.66]So you were just kind of like... And I'm just like, adventure, please.
[228:52.85]This RP brought... Wow.
[228:54.43]That was fun.
[228:57.39]Oh, I lost a good sword, I think.
[228:59.35]Oh, whatever.
[228:59.75]The game... The beta's over in three days.
[229:05.26]But at the end there, was there somebody left?
[229:07.78]There was one person left at the very end.
[229:10.94]Was I?
[229:11.30]Yeah.
[229:12.95]It said there were two.
[229:13.57]It was like two slots.
[229:18.92]So were people potentially just spectating me walking around like having having like a sad NPC ending?
[229:25.95]Probably.
[229:28.75]I mean, that's a great way to go out, I'd say.
[229:31.15]I mean, that was the circle.
[229:32.31]There's no one else there.
[229:33.15]All right, let me know.
[229:37.86]Let me know if this is better now.
[229:39.48]Is my in-game audio better now?
[229:42.54]I don't hear it in game.
[229:44.20]Oh, that's amazing.
[229:44.92]I have proposition.
[229:46.84]But sometimes I hear Jerma through your mic.
[229:51.50]And it also looks like my thing is active, but mine isn't active.
[230:00.14]Also, I've been trying to get an answer to this question for a while, but I keep forgetting.
[230:04.08]When I'm crouching and I'm trying to interact pressing F on something to pick up an item, it won't work.
[230:10.48]I have to stand up to pick up an item.
[230:14.86]have never heard of that for anybody else yeah that's weird so it's a little buggy though sometimes I don't know if it's happening to you guys too but sometimes I will like click to swing nothing happens
[230:26.78]Yeah, there's also an auto-swing problem that people have.
[230:30.34]We don't talk about them, okay?
[230:32.40]It's okay.
[230:33.20]It's all right.
[230:34.12]It happens, yeah.
[230:35.80]There are some strange things.
[230:37.10]Shift makes you unable to interact sometimes, apparently.
[230:39.92]Yeah.
[230:40.56]Wait, are you... Your crouch is bound to control, correct?
[230:46.22]Left control?
[230:48.40]Mine is left control.
[230:49.08]Left shift.
[230:50.07]There you go.
[230:50.47]Yeah, get it off shift.
[230:51.45]You're probably double bound.
[230:55.40]yeah the game's probably not recognizing that you're double bound and not changing that yeah my jump button is also right click so when I'm in the game transferring items over to my inventory I jump every time I transfer an item stir you've been you you've been using the like tribes ascend control scheme haven't you for like the last 10 years yeah I'm I'm a mouse 2 jumper that's actually like kind of efficient but also what's wrong with you
[231:22.63]I mean I like it and I enjoy it and it doesn't work in a lot of games I feel like I I was I've done mouse wheel jump but I've never done right click I mean that's you do you man all right let's let's get it I feel like it's been an hour since we've played the video game all right you guys I'm trying but I'm mostly just sitting in this lobby waiting for you guys to ready that's okay my experience I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready no you need to hurry up get your ass in the game
[231:53.15]Alright, first of all.
[231:53.77]This is the one.
[231:55.89]Most of this has been me getting gear for you guys.
[231:58.49]Hello, friend.
[231:59.87]Hello.
[232:00.19]Hello.
[232:00.51]Can you hear me?
[232:00.93]Can you hear me?
[232:01.97]Is my audio?
[232:02.41]Is my audio?
[232:03.97]Never.
[232:04.33]That's never enough.
[232:05.31]I just turned off in-game.
[232:06.75]It was being really weird, and I kept hearing Jerma talk through, like, your mic.
[232:11.48]That's very strange.
[232:12.30]I thought I just turned it off, too.
[232:13.16]That's weird.
[232:17.40]Yeah, I know.
[232:18.22]I can't hear anything.
[232:22.16]Alright, yours are actually bleeding.
[232:23.90]Gamer time.
[232:25.12]Wait, does that give you that little notification that I'm muting and unmuting?
[232:28.41]No.
[232:29.29]Oh, okay, good.
[232:30.19]I thought when you said bleeding, I muted and unmuted.
[232:32.41]Rapier for you, Sir Diapy.
[232:35.25]So you have a melee in between.
[232:36.76]Otherwise, it's really annoying.
[232:37.80]It is.
[232:37.98]It is.
[232:38.10]I know.
[232:38.24]I played Ranger.
[232:42.26]I took your battleaxe as well.
[232:44.13]Yep.
[232:44.29]I don't know if you can use that, but have fun.
[232:46.47]I murdered your toys as well.
[232:48.43]Oh, thanks for the shoes because my feet really were getting super dirty walking around down here.
[232:53.67]I want to keep those dogs clean, right?
[232:57.18]This is loud too.
[232:57.90]Gonna shoot?
[233:14.79]Did that hit you?
[233:16.19]What?
[233:17.43]Oh my god.
[233:18.42]What the fuck is going on here?
[233:20.60]The Rangers are nuts.
[233:21.90]No, no, no.
[233:23.08]I thought that was you behind me.
[233:24.60]That was weird.
[233:25.82]Ow.
[233:27.66]Did you want me behind you?
[233:29.16]I can get there.
[233:30.44]Oh, Jesus.
[233:31.14]Be careful.
[233:32.32]I thought you were behind me.
[233:34.97]no I was told to be in front which I'm probably gonna get shot in the back of the head but I'm ready for it I am I'm a gamer I won't do that I could tell from the right click mouse button uh jump thing whatever that is yeah that's that was what truly identifies me as a gamer nice
[233:54.63]He's gaming.
[233:56.07]Why are the lights off?
[233:57.49]Why are the lights off?
[234:00.31]Explain this to me.
[234:02.65]This room is rough because there's a wraith here and I have a shitty weapon for this.
[234:07.57]So we're going to turn around.
[234:09.11]Executive decision, I'm sorry.
[234:10.89]That room is actually hell.
[234:12.63]Where is it?
[234:13.31]Yeah.
[234:15.04]Like, if you have a cleric, it's fine, but... Oh, uh, fun thing if you guys want to try it.
[234:20.74]You can do a Brewmaster Cleric, and you can drink beer to give you plus, like, 11 strength for 15 seconds, and you can literally just bite you with your fists and actually down them.
[234:29.83]You don't get drunk from it, right?
[234:31.85]Yep.
[234:32.55]It's a lot of fun.
[234:35.75]Alright, I got friends, uh, up here.
[234:38.61]Let's go.
[234:52.20]Oh, nice duck.
[234:54.68]Thanks, dude.
[234:56.06]Oh, hey, man, there's some sick loot on there for you.
[234:58.10]There it was.
[234:58.60]It was a lot of money.
[235:01.10]Oh, great work.
[235:01.69]I have a buckler over here if you want, if you're into that sort of thing.
[235:05.79]What's the difference between longbow, shortbow?
[235:09.11]Any significant thing I should be aware of?
[235:12.57]So the recurve bow, I know you can fire faster.
[235:14.61]How many arrows do you have on the recurve?
[235:16.03]Is it six or five or seven?
[235:17.55]Six.
[235:18.72]Yeah, so I think a longbow you get 5, but it's like 40 damage usually.
[235:21.64]30 to 40 damage if I'm not mistaken.
[235:23.58]It do be looking like a lot of damage.
[235:25.57]Stirrer, you're gonna want this.
[235:27.63]On the ground right now.
[235:28.67]That's an unbelievably good bow.
[235:32.39]Is it a survival bow?
[235:33.29]Please don't be a survival bow.
[235:34.15]It's a blue.
[235:35.73]Where?
[235:36.39]Yeah, but if it's a blue survival bow, it's just actually to tease.
[235:38.89]I'll put it on the ground.
[235:40.71]oh no oh boys this might be one of the wait hopefully it's in the oh no what happened it might be in the texture like see how there's like the actual like barrier I got it I got it I got it oh thank god I got it yeah there's a little piece sticking out there you go oh this is perfect oh bless the heavens we're gaming again I think she's got real damage on the longbow yeah
[236:06.14]I think some bows have different amount of arrows too, right?
[236:09.63]Yeah, yeah.
[236:10.61]So anyways, a longbow can obviously shoot longer.
[236:13.71]It's a bigger bow and then that'll shoot quicker.
[236:16.60]Recurves are really good.
[236:17.54]This is just the same shitty room.
[236:18.94]Yeah, this is literally the same room.
[236:20.28]We can run through it, it's just...
[236:22.20]I have my I have my fear up it's just risky-ish but I mean we don't really have we'd have to run all the way around yeah we can do this we're fine we're gamers yeah you can shoot through that hole if you're spaced back like you can shoot him if you step back beautiful oh you can't technical yep yeah I mean you can also see he's not high enough to shoot here let me turn this off for you oh so much better I was worried
[236:51.85]Alright, boys.
[236:52.55]Just run with me, please.
[236:53.76]This way.
[236:57.70]Doesn't mean shoot.
[237:00.02]Ow!
[237:00.72]He's aggroing enemies on purpose.
[237:02.38]He's griefing us.
[237:03.62]Does it matter if I shoot him?
[237:04.82]No, I'm kidding.
[237:07.24]It was all in jest, my friend.
[237:08.78]I didn't like that joke.
[237:10.74]That joke was hurtful.
[237:14.50]Good.
[237:14.76]It means it was funny.
[237:19.99]This is supposed to be a gamer run, not an argument run.
[237:22.25]We've had plenty of those.
[237:23.47]Please, guys.
[237:25.04]I'm going to eat my snacks.
[237:31.02]Oh, this guy was shot with arrows.
[237:33.18]Boys, look at this.
[237:34.02]Look at this.
[237:34.68]We're going to do like our Witcher 3 Geralt of Rivia inspection.
[237:38.88]Arrows to the body.
[237:40.45]Somebody shot him.
[237:41.47]That's all I got for you.
[237:42.27]Those were my arrows.
[237:44.13]Geralt, those were my arrows.
[237:45.87]I thought he was on the ground pretending to be dead.
[237:50.63]I'm a little upset.
[237:52.21]My winter senses have killed me.
[237:58.44]More damage.
[237:59.24]Don't move.
[237:59.72]Don't you move a shoe.
[238:00.74]Don't move.
[238:02.08]Listening.
[238:02.38]Alright, we're good.
[238:04.10]Follow me.
[238:04.34]There's spiders.
[238:04.92]There's a lever right here.
[238:07.14]Let's get in this room.
[238:11.44]That's where those spiders are.
[238:13.38]Rats!
[238:14.19]Rats!
[238:15.23]Rats!
[238:15.99]I'm coming.
[238:16.37]I'm coming.
[238:17.83]Alright, we gotta start going south.
[238:19.77]Speed.
[238:21.80]Oh my goodness.
[238:22.64]I don't know what this means, but this is cool looking.
[238:27.20]Stir.
[238:27.54]If only we had a lockpick.
[238:29.04]Oh fuck.
[238:30.32]I'm gonna start being a lockpick guy.
[238:32.98]Oh my god.
[238:35.12]I've never seen one of these.
[238:37.76]We're about to get cuddled by the circle if we don't get out of here.
[238:40.13]Shit.
[238:40.91]Let's go dude.
[238:42.11]I wonder what's in there.
[238:44.15]Alright, I'm out.
[238:45.03]Bye bye.
[238:48.78]Buh-bye.
[238:51.71]There's probably all kinds of jewels and gems.
[238:53.73]I wanna be just a green.
[239:03.11]Yeah, that's possible too.
[239:03.79]Oh, friends!
[239:04.83]Hello, friends.
[239:06.40]Hello.

[239:13.16]Hold on.
[239:13.58]I'm in the secret passage.
[239:14.68]I was going for a deception check.

[239:47.77]Take this trap if you want because you're a ranger now.
[239:49.69]You can use those.
[239:54.84]Oh my god, throwing axes are so good.
[239:58.63]Do you mind if I take this potion, my friend?

[240:03.95]Oh, thank you.
[240:04.97]So coined.
[240:06.01]Do you want these throwing axes?

[241:01.15]They ran.
[241:02.67]Oh yeah.
[241:03.15]Oh yeah.
[241:04.75]They're certified runners.
[241:06.07]Oh my god.

[241:07.13]They're so dead.
[241:08.23]Stop.

[241:23.48]Hail Mary.
[241:24.72]Oh, so close.
[241:31.26]There's a lot of shit in here.
[241:32.40]I don't know if we fight in here.
[241:35.08]It's fine.
[241:35.54]You'll be alright.
[241:36.20]There's a lot of people in here.
[241:37.34]The heck?
[241:40.46]Sturg, where are you?
[241:42.32]Wait, you left.
[241:43.00]Oh, Sturg left.
[241:44.46]I went home.
[241:45.36]Oh, shit.
[241:45.94]I mean, he was gaming.
[241:46.76]He was gaming.
[241:47.34]Yeah, you were.
[241:49.56]You guys ran off.
[241:51.48]I was looting like a secret room and then you guys just kept going.
[241:55.02]I'm out of here.
[241:55.97]I'm sorry.
[241:56.37]You're on your own.
[241:57.27]No, you're good.
[241:59.75]I'm metagaming.
[242:00.95]Oh, he put the worms on you.
[242:09.51]Yeah, I'm out of here.
[242:10.19]I have a lot of stuff.
[242:23.54]Oh, yes.
[242:24.82]Okay, goodbye.
[242:29.58]Oh, bastard.
[242:32.37]You're in a predicament down here.
[242:35.59]Why's that?
[242:38.59]Yeah, there were so many things in that room.
[242:42.15]I kind of abandoned you, but I'm sorry.
[242:43.90]Nah, dude, you're fine.
[242:46.04]Gamers don't have feelings.
[242:48.72]I'm actually offended you're apologizing right now.
[242:51.00]Well, in that case... Um... F you!
[242:55.32]Uh-huh.
[242:55.90]Yeah, yeah.
[242:56.96]Well, thank you.
[242:57.46]Now I feel better.
[243:00.74]Gamers.
[243:01.16]Are you going for a battle here?
[243:02.49]Because you got a lot of potential.
[243:04.45]I think there's somebody in that room.
[243:07.89]Well, they have to come to me.
[243:09.21]That's the beautiful thing about this run.
[243:14.55]Watch out!
[243:18.16]I was drinking out of... I was drinking water.
[243:20.00]And I just like scared the shit out of me.
[243:25.94]Trevor, there's someone in your room!
[243:28.22]Get out!
[243:33.35]If they're dumb, they're gonna come through.
[243:34.71]I really hope they do.
[243:36.25]Well, what if they just run right in?
[243:37.55]Well, they have to go around at least.
[243:39.61]Then I get to swing on them first.
[243:44.45]This is what gaming looks like, boys.
[243:47.52]Ah, too bad.
[243:48.80]Hey, it's all good.
[243:51.56]I was kind of hoping somebody was just going to run in and take it.
[243:53.86]Oh, me too.
[243:54.26]Okay, cool.
[243:57.80]That should be a lot of money.
[244:03.60]Do you instantly sell or do you just put it in your stash?
[244:06.88]I sell pretty much everything, unless it's something that's valuable.
[244:10.60]Yeah, I'm afraid too.
[244:11.36]I might get yelled at, so I'm already ready.
[244:14.52]Yeah, I'm going to start yelling in a second.
[244:20.24]just takes a second hold on oh my god this guy it just takes a second sure it does look at that look at that I'm gonna fill that I got an oil lamp is that is that a relevant so it's basically just a molly you right click and you throw it like a molly
[244:43.57]Oh, I assumed it was like a... It actually is a light source.
[244:47.01]So if you left click, it's a light source.
[244:49.72]Do you know what I want to do?
[244:51.56]I'm going to be such a fucking weirdo.
[244:55.34]Like the last day of the beta, I'm going to fill my entire inventory with 10 gold stacks and just be a loot goblin and just die for somebody.
[245:04.72]And they're going to look at me and take my gear and go... You know what I mean?
[245:11.06]Fill every single slot.
[245:13.42]What are you, Mr. Beast?
[245:14.83]Like, what?
[245:19.31]Like, what?
[245:19.79]Like, to make somebody's day for no reason?
[245:21.65]Yeah, like, I don't know.
[245:24.39]I hate that.
[245:25.13]Why?
[245:25.55]I'd rather have worms.
[245:28.24]Why?
[245:28.62]I hate it.
[245:30.14]Okay, if I were to... Alright, if you killed somebody with an axe in this game, and you looted them, and their whole inventory was a stack of gold, you don't think you would chuckle and be like, what the fuck are you doing, man?
[245:42.48]I thought you were going to run around and leave a trail.
[245:46.48]Dude, that'd be even better.
[245:48.30]When I get hit, drop five and keep running.
[245:55.61]Just fill my inventory with potions and surgical kits and just run around.
[245:59.51]Every time I get hit, just drop five stacks and just keep going.
[246:01.73]I mean, you play Borderlands, right?
[246:04.39]A little bit, yeah.
[246:05.91]There's the loot goblins that you shoot and they just drop.
[246:09.65]Uh, they just drop gear as you shoot them, pretty much.
[246:11.94]Sonic.
[246:12.28]Same concept.
[246:13.84]What in the world?
[246:20.24]It was actually, like, pretty good singing.
[246:23.31]That was pretty good.
[246:27.85]Alright, guys.
[246:28.45]Stick together.
[246:28.93]Keep your wits about you.
[246:30.13]We all might make it out alive.
[246:33.72]I mean, we split up.
[246:34.62]We still made it.
[246:36.50]Because we're committing to being video game players now.
[246:39.28]You guys walk through like four rooms of unopened chests.
[246:43.97]That was just opening boxes and then I turned to look where you were and you were like the other side of the map.
[246:48.10]So I was like, okay, bye.
[246:49.90]Well, I prioritize getting kills, getting frags, you know?
[246:53.08]I don't need that.
[246:54.32]You know, getting money is for plebs at this point.
[246:56.06]I'm already rich.
[246:57.18]Well, unless you want to do your funny loot goblin video that I'm doing.
[247:02.79]True.
[247:03.27]Did he get hit by that?
[247:07.29]Oh, boys.
[247:07.73]I got boys on me.
[247:08.29]You guys looking for a fight?
[247:09.99]Already?
[247:11.81]Yeah.
[247:12.37]I mean, in theory, we want to let them live a little longer so we can loot them later.
[247:16.11]Yeah.
[247:16.41]But I like killing them now.
[247:18.71]You're kind of a wild one.
[247:24.58]Oh, he made the jump.
[247:25.56]He's kind of nuts.
[247:27.06]That's crazy.
[247:28.04]Don't mess with that guy.
[247:28.74]He's good.
[247:32.65]What the fuck?
[247:33.53]Oh, I killed one.
[247:35.57]yeah beautiful well done sir yeah same where are you sir I I don't where did you guys go you're dead I was in the starting room killing the enemies that were around and picking things up should I stop picking things up and playing the core loop of the game are we done with that no he he just saw he had bloodlust and he just ran after a bunch of people okay I don't know a guy landed on me I'm dead like I made no footsteps and just appeared on me and then I died
[248:04.69]So... How do I put this?
[248:10.63]Hold on.
[248:11.33]I gotta fuck this guy up real quick.
[248:12.53]Please hold.
[248:13.43]Oh wait, you're alive!
[248:14.40]I thought they killed you.
[248:15.12]Oh yeah.
[248:15.82]No, no.
[248:16.12]I'm nuts.
[248:16.58]I'm realizing who I'm watching right now.
[248:19.44]So you just left me to die.
[248:26.49]Okay, these traps suck.
[248:27.53]Holy shit.
[248:34.09]Oh, I just... Okay, that was weird.
[248:41.03]Gamer versus gamer.
[248:45.77]If he's smart, he won't go through.
[248:56.92]I almost got his head, dude.
[248:57.92]Yeah, that's close.
[249:00.46]But anyways, I usually go for player kills immediately because you obviously, if you kill them, you get the best loot because they come in kitted most of the times.
[249:07.96]So if you can just get a good kill on them as a barb, you get the loot, which means we all got loot.
[249:11.70]Does that make sense?
[249:13.64]Yeah.
[249:15.76]Well, you level up quick too, right?
[249:18.00]If you kill a player, it's not worth a lot.
[249:20.54]Yeah, 100%.
[249:20.88]Okay.
[249:27.69]We have, like, our three actual classes that we have been accidentally RPing as the whole time.
[249:33.71]You're, like, the bloodlust barbarian, and that's what you're doing.
[249:37.52]Stir is, like, the tinkerer that wants to collect the loot and the toys.
[249:41.82]I thought we were playing the game!
[249:43.64]And I'm, like, the fucking stand-up comedian that just walks around and yells at people and dies.
[249:50.45]Yeah, I mean, make no mistake about it, I'm actually a troglodyte, but
[249:54.09]Everyone wants to live more than two minutes.
[249:55.57]The bard, the jester.
[249:57.55]You're the loot goblin.
[250:01.65]What class is the stand-up?
[250:03.87]Oh yeah, you're the barbarian, you're the tinkerer thief, and I'm the stand-up comedian.
[250:09.74]They need to add instruments to this game.
[250:11.52]I think the conversation was adding bards and either warlocks or necromancers to the game.
[250:19.82]Did they actually have plans on adding more classes?
[250:22.48]Yeah, no, I mean, they have completely been transparent on this is Dungeons & Dragons multiplayer.
[250:29.86]Really?
[250:30.18]Yeah.
[250:31.74]Which is going to be interesting with the new Wizards of the Coast decisions.
[250:37.92]Well, I look, any content is cool.
[250:40.46]I mean, I think the game is pretty close.
[250:42.74]So just right now.
[250:43.44]Yeah. 100%.
[250:49.18]Yeah, the game is, the demo is free.
[250:51.52]Some people have been asking about it.
[250:52.92]You can just play it right now during the Steam demo week, whatever.
[250:56.46]Yeah, I had a wild thought, and maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but hear me out.
[251:01.03]Imagine this game with a Forge system, like Halo Forge, where they make the dungeons and you have to traverse player-made dungeons.
[251:09.83]interesting like a mario maker thing it's like just these nuts dungeons I'd love more pve pve I think in this game could be really really awesome yeah any more pve would be great because it doesn't spoon feed you in terms of combat it's more like it's more like a you good luck yeah let's see what they do I mean it's been pretty fun so far so
[251:37.98]all right yes all right fearing I think uh the elder scrolls does that the pve part there are so many of these things yeah make sure you loot every single one of these when you kill them that shot was nice this guy's a game
[252:07.46]Oh, lockpick?
[252:08.06]Here.
[252:08.88]Here, you have the highest resource.
[252:09.84]I think your lockpick chances are better.
[252:11.62]Oh, wait.
[252:13.14]Don't drop any items on the pyramid that can get stuck in the textures.
[252:17.04]The elevated textures.
[252:18.69]Yeah.
[252:20.21]Yeah, like how that short bow we couldn't see it, remember?
[252:23.83]Anyways, look at this little flashlight.
[252:26.35]Oh, this one was red.
[252:28.53]Yep, the red ones are like the elite version of the death skulls.
[252:35.39]But here take I'm gonna drop I'm gonna put this on the body of something and you can use that to on the chest up here Mr. Ranger man, I'll put it in here
[252:48.56]Wait, I'm sorry.
[252:49.37]I'm so spaced out.
[252:50.39]Lockpick and chest.
[252:51.85]You use lockpick.
[252:53.39]You smarter than me.
[252:56.17]I take lockpick.
[252:57.21]I go pick lock.
[252:58.03]You take lockpick.
[252:58.75]You use.
[253:00.27]You know minigame of lockpick?
[253:01.63]It's very quick, by the way.
[253:03.19]It's not like slow.
[253:04.83]Okay.
[253:05.10]Well, if your character's dumb, it's harder.
[253:08.38]I...
[253:09.99]That was like a jump scare and I was supposed to click.
[253:13.14]It's very, I couldn't even warn you because me saying it was fast is like, okay, how fast?
[253:17.64]And it's, it's unbelievably fast.
[253:19.30]So yeah.
[253:20.66]I mean, it's like the human benchmark test fast.
[253:24.26]And what button does it?
[253:26.14]It's left click.
[253:27.42]It's really annoying.
[253:28.64]Okay.
[253:28.88]I thought so.
[253:29.42]My chat was telling me random buttons.
[253:32.20]Well, good.
[253:32.80]I mean, well, you do have weird bonds potentially.
[253:35.07]So your left click is probably like a foot pedal.
[253:39.23]Yeah, it is.
[253:42.81]I don't know how you knew that.
[253:43.55]That's weird.
[253:44.53]All right.
[253:46.42]Yeah, no, the lockpicking is actually very hard.
[253:48.66]It's not simple.
[253:51.02]Yeah, I thought it was going to be a whole menu, not like a jump scare, it's over.
[253:56.32]Well, I always envisioned it like Splinter Cell Chaos Theory lockpicking, and I was very wrong when I got to do it the first time.
[254:18.11]well done boys well done I'll hit them for good measure teamwork baby we did it I saw your you took your pants off I saw you you didn't see anything
[254:33.25]Stop, stop, stop.
[254:34.53]Ooh, there's a lockpick.
[254:35.75]Do you want someone to try it again?
[254:37.01]Are you decent at this?
[254:40.11]Sturdy, do you want to try it again?
[254:42.99]I would like to try.
[254:43.75]I don't have any more lockpicks.
[254:44.75]There's one right here.
[254:45.29]I'm going to fully acknowledge that I am trash at them.
[254:48.31]And again, my character is actually dumb.
[254:50.03]Also, I have a rapier for you if you need some of it, my friend.
[254:52.17]Sturdy, come over here.
[254:54.25]I'll just give it to you.
[254:56.41]Hold on.
[254:56.99]I'm putting 40 arrows in this guy's head real quick.
[255:00.34]And some of them are going through.
[255:02.07]Here, I'll come help.
[255:02.79]Oh, jeez.
[255:03.32]Oh, my Lord.
[255:05.38]Oh, my God.
[255:09.04]For one second, I thought that was somebody in the Discord call.
[255:11.94]I was like, is somebody in somebody's background coughing?
[255:13.94]All right, stir.
[255:15.92]Block pick.
[255:16.34]Let's try it.
[255:17.92]And then sword for melee if you need it.
[255:19.44]No, no, it's fine.
[255:22.10]I'll take that sword.
[255:29.65]Fire.
[255:30.37]There's it.
[255:31.99]Does it really?
[255:32.43]No.
[255:34.57]Yeah.
[255:35.35]Yeah.
[255:37.17]I was like, bro, I've been wondering if there's a way to clear that forever now.
[255:42.70]I don't think so.
[255:47.36]Okay.
[255:47.74]Do I have to hit the red part or just... The yellow parts.
[255:51.42]Yellow parts, I believe.
[255:52.18]If I'm not mistaken.
[255:54.62]Within the... Yeah, the yellows.
[256:02.56]I missed it by like a tiny little bit.
[256:05.83]It's so hard.
[256:06.43]It's awful.
[256:07.15]It's awful.
[256:08.03]So does anything slow that down?
[256:09.65]Does resourcefulness slow that down?
[256:11.35]I'm not positive, but I'm pretty close to positive.
[256:16.67]I've been told that it does by a respected source.
[256:20.81]Okay.
[256:25.46]Oh, I got a friend.
[256:27.15]Tango on me.
[256:27.67]Tango on me.
[256:28.95]Uh, there's people back in that room.
[256:30.11]Yo, bro, you do not want this smoke, dude.
[256:31.43]I'm telling you right now.
[256:32.43]In the room we just came from, there's a guy.
[256:34.33]Well, fire above the door behind us.
[256:36.25]There's a guy behind us.
[256:45.83]Don't shoot me.
[256:46.31]Don't shoot me.
[256:46.77]Oh, my God.
[256:47.05]I need to heal.
[256:51.03]Healing.
[256:51.67]I'll be right there in a second.
[256:52.61]Oh, he just got hit by a mage.
[256:54.47]Oh, my God.
[256:56.91]Careful.
[256:57.19]Alright, boys.
[256:58.93]Where's he at?
[256:59.99]They ran.
[257:00.29]There's a mage up here, though.
[257:03.01]Left or forward?
[257:03.81]Left or forward?
[257:04.79]Forward.
[257:05.37]Like over here.
[257:06.77]There's a mage in here, though.
[257:07.89]Oh, okay.
[257:09.49]Two tangos.
[257:09.97]Got it.
[257:11.09]In the lockpick room.
[257:14.39]They're shooting arrows at us, I think.
[257:17.93]I don't know if that's... Fell down the hole.
[257:19.61]Fell down the hole.
[257:20.57]I fell down the hole.
[257:21.65]Oh, no.
[257:22.05]Fell down the hole.
[257:22.65]Barbarian on the other room?
[257:23.56]Fell down the hole.
[257:24.14]I need to heal before I come get you.
[257:26.44]Or help.
[257:29.10]Fell down the hole.
[257:29.72]Who is shooting?
[257:30.86]I bet to me there's a barbarian on the other hallway.
[257:34.06]I'm gonna die.
[257:34.58]Oh, I see.
[257:36.15]Nope.
[257:36.77]No!
[257:38.95]I didn't even see the hole.
[257:40.03]Oh, we were doing so well.
[257:41.57]What happened?
[257:42.21]Uh...
[257:44.73]If you want to lead him up, and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to fire him.
[257:48.37]Oh, beautiful.
[257:48.88]That's a beautiful trap.
[257:51.50]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[257:52.36]Hole, hole, hole.
[257:53.16]Yep, beautiful.
[257:55.72]We're better off closing the door first.
[257:57.02]I'm going to act like the door's fucked.
[257:58.77]Yep, exactly.
[257:59.47]Boom.
[257:59.91]I didn't watch.
[258:00.45]I hit him.
[258:12.08]I didn't even see the hole.
[258:13.46]It's like blending into my brain on the screen.
[258:18.56]Oh, you disabled the trap?
[258:19.68]There is an exit down the hole, by the way.
[258:21.78]But there's a shitload of enemies.
[258:24.94]Fuck you, leave the door closed.
[258:26.02]I like it that way.
[258:36.79]Oh, they're shooting me through the...
[258:39.24]I think it's four.
[258:41.37]That's why the throwing actions were good.
[258:44.11]Is it three or four people?
[258:46.79]How did you fall down this hole?
[258:47.93]How did I fall down it?
[258:50.34]How did I fall down it?
[258:51.56]It doesn't make any sense.
[258:54.44]How?
[258:59.62]it's like the opposite ends of both extraordinary spectrums there like I just I was just teleported down there it was just like and you are desperately trying to fall through it and you can't get through it I it doesn't make any sense to my brain I'm a big boy hard to fit through and you got a full diapy
[259:22.90]We had two groups.
[259:23.92]There were three to our right and three to our left.
[259:25.88]I may have fallen down a hole, but whatever.
[259:28.00]It's all right.
[259:28.84]Let's go.
[259:29.30]We'll go again.
[259:30.84]Yeah, yeah.
[259:32.67]I'm sorry.
[259:34.09]Yes.
[259:34.97]Just one second.
[259:36.77]I know, I know, I know.
[259:37.47]I'm the worst.
[259:41.19]There have been worse people.
[259:43.40]I literally cannot get kills without a weapon that's not the starting weapon on this character.
[259:49.16]That's so funny.
[259:50.68]you know I know how you feel after I put seven arrows into one zombie's head yeah like you this is not a game where you use base gear like you you do not use base gear if you're not like if you're doing a scav run sure like where you're literally just looting and running yeah well you want to do one of those we can do those do that there's no uh there's no fletcher there's no traveling fletcher you know I'm gonna you know what that's I got a lot of money that's a good idea
[260:18.57]You should probably buy gear.
[260:19.95]You'll kill shit a lot faster.
[260:22.25]I'll make more money.
[260:24.15]I'm going to buy this.
[260:25.89]No, I'm not.
[260:26.31]It's a hundred bucks.
[260:27.97]You know what?
[260:28.33]Let's gamble.
[260:29.27]I'm going for it.
[260:29.93]I've been waiting to do this for the last two days, three days.
[260:34.83]Stuff kind of sucks.
[260:37.69]I have a battle axe here.
[260:38.61]Do you want me to buy it, gamble it, and if it's good, just give it to you?
[260:43.38]Yeah, but if it's trash, I'm going to feel bad.
[260:45.30]I have money.
[260:46.24]I have money.
[260:48.79]I mean, yeah, dude.
[260:49.69]I'll try it once.
[260:50.75]Is it worth it?
[260:53.01]I have heard bad.
[260:54.23]Wait, are you talking about the Goblin Battleaxe guy?
[260:56.54]I got a green Battleaxe.
[260:58.34]47 damage plus 2.5% physical damage.
[261:00.74]Do you want it?
[261:02.00]Yeah, I'll run it.
[261:02.60]Absolutely.
[261:03.00]Okay, all right.
[261:03.50]I'm going to try it at least once.
[261:06.10]Yeah.
[261:06.68]That's pretty good.
[261:07.24]Green, yeah.
[261:08.44]That's a lot better than what I have.
[261:10.42]Yeah, okay.
[261:12.72]I have a short sword for you, by the way.
[261:14.74]Stern.
[261:16.46]Okay.
[261:18.14]I don't want to bring this.
[261:18.98]I'm going to lose it.
[261:20.76]I'm bringing two lockpicks that I'm going to immediately drop.
[261:26.31]Oh, who sells the lockpicks?
[261:28.45]I believe Blacksmith.
[261:29.69]Let me check.
[261:33.85]Or I am wrong.
[261:35.15]Maybe... Interesting choice.
[261:44.78]no the woodsman doesn't have them for me maybe it's a momentary thing um they all just for me or you know they're all selling default gear that you don't want to buy for very large amounts of money um eight to like because I'm level two guys what do you what do you I'll get you something what do you want no I'm good I want to start
[262:11.80]Yeah, I hate to bring this up, but there is a purple Zweihander on my merch.
[262:17.90]Just wanted to let you know that.
[262:21.80]I know you're a big... I am a pretty big Zweihander fan.
[262:27.77]I'm just going to get some default shit.
[262:29.21]Why not?
[262:32.25]Just don't buy greys.
[262:34.07]If you buy a white for eight gold, that makes sense because it's at least slightly better in some runs, but like...
[262:41.23]if you can buy greens off the merchant that's fine oh you said do not buy gray items correct okay just don't bother no so don't like don't bother at all okay I see what you mean oh no oh here we go just make sure I clarify that and I want to make sure I get it right oh nice is that is that a is that gray weapon or uh stuff from the armor smith I said I had it from before I just was I want to make sure I didn't do something stupid
[263:11.54]If anything, if it means anything, you look cooler now.
[263:15.58]Alright, I got a cool axe for you.
[263:17.64]Oh, God bless.
[263:24.19]Here you go.
[263:26.45]Oh, you're a madman.
[263:27.47]Do not pick up these.
[263:28.23]Because they're crap.
[263:30.23]Holy shit!
[263:33.03]Oh, that's right!
[263:33.77]That's the lobby.
[263:39.26]Did you just drop stuff?
[263:40.62]He did, dude.
[263:42.88]He's a madman.
[263:45.05]You are the catalyst of chaos.
[263:47.47]Holy shit, dude.
[263:49.07]I'm sorry.
[263:49.99]Did you get it?
[263:51.38]I got it, bro, but I had to go through Stern's body, too.
[263:54.74]I was like, oh my god, please don't be another player.
[263:59.07]Alright, here's your sword.
[264:00.05]Here's your sword.
[264:01.87]Start your sword.
[264:03.21]Oh my god.
[264:03.81]I'm not even realizing.
[264:06.45]Jesus.
[264:10.59]Jesus.
[264:11.19]I got to get a hold of myself here.
[264:17.49]Alright.
[264:20.23]Did you get the lockpicks?
[264:22.56]Yes.
[264:24.26]Here you go.
[264:25.92]Oh good.
[264:26.28]I thought I killed him.
[264:26.92]Jesus.
[264:28.47]There is a good armor here for people that like wearing armor.
[264:32.29]Watch out.
[264:32.71]Oh, God.
[264:33.25]I'm going to hit this lockpick.
[264:40.50]Oh, you got this?
[264:41.86]So big.
[264:42.76]I'm going to hit it big.
[264:44.56]Hit it big.
[264:45.82]Hit it well.
[264:47.34]Come on, Ster.
[264:48.58]We believe in you.
[264:50.72]Can you watch it go around once?
[264:55.55]I believe not.
[264:56.17]I think you have to just do it.
[264:58.33]it comes up at such a random time I'm not used to where it is on the screen it changes it changes that's the fun part uh take this hey take this chest plate please come on dude get it I thought you're gonna run on the traps and off yourself can you uh take this
[265:22.22]I can't wear that.
[265:22.84]I found it.
[265:23.58]I'm at, I'm at, I'm at, uh... Wait, wait, wait.
[265:26.18]Hold on, stir.
[265:26.76]Did I just do, like, 20% of your health in one punch?
[265:30.39]Yeah, no, the punches don't mess around.
[265:32.19]They're, like, 20 damage at least.
[265:34.13]I, sir, I, I thought it... All right, all right, I did it once.
[265:38.35]I did it once.
[265:39.80]I did it once.
[265:41.18]You want to even it out.
[265:42.16]That's what happened, Diapy.
[265:43.52]That's the... What's he doing?
[265:44.82]Why are you doing this?
[265:46.02]You just...
[265:50.52]I just feel like I'm getting bullied.
[265:52.10]I'm angry because I failed the jump scare twice.
[265:58.07]Alright, alright, alright.
[265:59.05]Let's fucking go for it.
[266:00.63]Civil War.
[266:11.37]Secret wall here.
[266:16.38]Almost stepped on the trap there.
[266:23.08]To be fair, it really is impossible.
[266:26.76]It's rough.
[266:27.50]It shouldn't be as hard as it is.
[266:29.40]I guess the reward is really great because there could be something really amazing.
[266:45.54]I want to be able to see.
[266:50.87]Ooh, there's a tomb.
[266:56.57]Uh, we got tangos by us.
[266:59.79]Uh, rogue helmet.
[267:01.01]On the ground.
[267:02.94]Where they at?
[267:04.78]Uh, I think they're north, maybe.
[267:09.38]Watch out tangos.
[267:10.08]Hmm.
[267:17.35]Yeah, because those don't go off for no reason.
[267:19.23]So they're absolutely fighting something.
[267:21.73]Well, let them let them get hurt.
[267:25.23]Oh, he's metagaming.
[267:27.54]I mean, that's what you said.
[267:30.08]That's we're going by the smartest gamer in the room right now.
[267:32.70]I think it might actually it might be.
[267:34.18]I'll calm down.
[267:35.98]Calm down.
[267:36.86]My knowledge is five.
[267:38.36]OK.
[267:38.56]I have to I have to open this because I have to go get that health over there.
[267:42.94]Watch the spiders.
[267:43.70]So spiders welcoming.
[267:46.46]All right, running through, running through, and spawning these.
[267:50.60]Come help me kill them.
[267:51.67]Pressing E. Kill.
[267:57.45]Can you shoot the Skelly Archer through the jail?
[268:01.68]Yeah.
[268:02.56]Otherwise, he's going to farm me.
[268:15.48]I'm doing it.
[268:16.85]I'm shooting them.
[268:18.31]I'm getting them.
[268:20.31]He's nuts.
[268:21.47]There's like bugs, whatever they are, stuck under there.
[268:24.85]Careful.
[268:25.79]Like bat things.
[268:26.45]I'm getting them.
[268:28.40]I'm shooting them.
[268:31.32]Oh my god, this guy's nuts.
[268:33.62]What the fuck?
[268:34.48]Did he just shoot me with an arrow?
[268:38.16]I was shooting that guy and you... Why would he be aggro to me?
[268:42.23]That was not you.
[268:49.54]Shoes in here, but meh.
[268:52.32]That's an emerald.
[268:52.94]Diaby, do you have bandages?
[269:03.88]He should have a campfire, which is... I believe I have one.
[269:09.04]I have two if you want to heal without us needing to use the campfire.
[269:13.70]I have food I can eat as well oh that's right that's true but that almost is like too good and well that's okay although I will say that that health shrine does regen if we chill here for a sec oh okay yeah oh my have you stand next to this uh altar of sacrifice it whispers have you heard it it's scary actually creepy this is crap this is now
[269:44.82]Well, not quite yet.
[269:46.30]I'll keep it for now.
[269:47.38]I got a long sword.
[269:51.46]Ooh, you did.
[269:52.60]I would love to take that.
[269:55.70]I'll take it.
[269:59.17]Absolutely.
[269:59.85]Cool.
[270:06.97]Beautiful.
[270:08.17]Cool.
[270:09.89]Cool.
[270:10.03]Cool.
[270:12.06]Cool.
[270:14.96]Oh, wow.
[270:17.16]Mimic.
[270:17.56]Still gets me.
[270:18.30]Still gets me.
[270:21.15]Cool, cool, cool, cool.
[270:26.55]I just feel cool with the long sword.
[270:28.49]Like, it's just the swing is so cool.
[270:30.35]I like the second swing.
[270:31.15]It's my favorite.
[270:31.85]So, do the mimics have better stuff in them?
[270:33.52]I was just going to bring that up.
[270:35.42]You would think, but I have not seen anything with that.
[270:46.39]Hey.
[270:48.93]Uh, this way probably look through here through.
[270:51.81]I don't see anything.
[270:52.73]Yeah, we can go.
[270:54.01]It will just make the two lefts and basically reroute in.
[270:59.48]To the circle.
[271:01.60]There have been looters here.
[271:06.23]I'm gonna feel.
[271:07.13]Let's get the full help.
[271:12.77]People always want to do it in this little area in here.
[271:15.57]This little secret hidey hole.
[271:16.75]Let's do it.
[271:19.27]Let's go in.
[271:20.63]It'll be super safe when I close lever.
[271:24.92]But there'll be stuff in here.
[271:29.04]For some reason, I had assumed you'd use campfire.
[271:32.32]Do you want this helmet?
[271:33.82]It's a plus four physical power green.
[271:35.38]I feel like you should be the one that has this.
[271:37.04]It's on the ground.
[271:39.82]Oh, wow.
[271:40.40]Yes, I would love that.
[271:42.83]You are the physical power, important wielder of acts.
[271:49.68]You can't break with torches.
[271:51.00]Oh, wow.
[271:51.44]Maybe I should have just left it closed.
[271:59.98]Oh, shit.
[272:14.73]Oh, we got bugs.
[272:15.91]Poison bug.
[272:16.45]Did I get hit by him?
[272:20.09]I did.
[272:20.49]How?
[272:20.77]I was behind the wall.
[272:32.10]Scaling Archer.
[272:42.29]That poison gas is just such a great zoner.
[272:44.59]It's the worst.
[272:46.21]Yep.
[272:46.43]Did I hit you?
[272:53.28]Nope.
[272:53.56]Thank god.
[272:55.46]Alright, we gotta run, run.
[272:58.70]Uh, you should take doors.
[273:00.30]Because, um, I opened them the slowest.
[273:05.59]Oh my god, get out of the fucking way!
[273:13.70]We gotta get the hell out of here like right now.
[273:15.44]Yep.
[273:24.40]We'll be alright.
[273:28.48]Beautiful.
[273:31.04]What the fuck?
[273:32.24]Isn't that an archer?
[273:33.24]Oh, what is it?
[273:33.91]No, we got players.
[273:34.47]Players.
[273:34.71]Archers shooting across the way.
[273:35.75]Yep.
[273:35.85]Yep.
[273:36.03]Yep.
[273:36.15]Yep.
[273:36.27]Yep.
[273:38.99]I need to heal somewhere.
[273:40.41]That guy's got a big ass shield.
[273:41.69]I'm going to sit here for a second.
[273:44.09]Yep.
[273:47.94]Careful, Ster.
[273:48.72]Oh, I actually don't have heals.
[273:50.00]This is amazing.
[273:51.88]I have a bandage and I have a potion.
[273:53.38]You should buy here.
[273:53.98]Let me...
[273:56.97]uh yeah if you if you appreciate it thank you thank you oh gosh you get them both uh yeah thank you it's better in your hands than it is in mine no no no we are a team
[274:14.30]Well, apparently he has a good aim.
[274:16.40]And I fucking jumped down.
[274:17.62]I did a movement speed buff.
[274:19.66]I did a movement speed buff and everything and I didn't make it.
[274:22.06]Actually, I'll shut up, sir.
[274:23.86]I'm dead.
[274:24.60]Like, there's no getting out of this.
[274:27.20]Owie.
[274:28.50]So... I don't know how I didn't do... How did I not get that?
[274:36.08]The jump there is kind of trash sometimes.
[274:38.72]I even did movement speed.
[274:39.86]I waited as long as I could.
[274:41.59]I just didn't make it.
[274:48.19]I think I was slow from all the gear I had on.
[274:51.27]I think we should be a little toxic.
[274:53.87]I have an idea.
[275:02.38]Crouch jump for extra height.
[275:05.79]It doesn't really help with distance, but he is right.
[275:09.79]I think I just had too much gear on.
[275:11.91]I just didn't realize.
[275:13.43]Because I thought, oh, I'm going to do my movement speed buff and I'll be able to get some momentum.
[275:16.33]It just didn't help.
[275:19.37]Wait.
[275:23.04]Nothing's changed.
[275:23.92]What's up?
[275:26.62]I don't even have it on.
[275:30.12]Oh.
[275:31.64]That's interesting.
[275:32.40]I must have changed it and forgot that I changed it.
[275:36.39]change what I haven't been doing movement speed I've been doing victory um victory strike so every time I press that I'm just trying to run fast oh sir thank you so much for the raid stir to the right song what do the raid song
[275:58.79]It's not a raid song, it's a break song, but do you want to hear it?
[276:00.87]It's actually kind of fire.
[276:01.81]No, I actually, no, I'm good.
[276:03.91]I'm not going to sing it.
[276:05.57]I was going to play it in stream.
[276:06.73]Geez.
[276:07.53]Okay.
[276:07.77]Never mind.
[276:08.72]Okay.
[276:09.54]Okay.
[276:10.82]Dermot, can you do the raid song?
[276:13.40]Oh.
[276:16.08]Ster, are you, um, are you on your way out here?
[276:20.74]Um, I can play like another.
[276:22.38]I like this name.
[276:25.36]I've been up a while.
[276:26.79]I like this Radagash Rom.
[276:32.65]Alright, let's do another one.
[276:34.91]Let's go for real this time.
[276:37.24]Alright, let's run it.
[276:39.28]We are ranged kings.
[276:42.81]Uh not but- so it's funny you raided me right as I put up my brb screen, right? Which has a song that I made.
[276:48.81]No no I just I put it up for a second because I got up for a second because like anytime I get up from my desk because I still have the ability to hear because I have uh wireless headphones anyways-
[276:59.00]Oh, cool.
[277:00.00]And like when you came in you were like: do the raid song. I thought you meant like my song was the raid song. I didn't even know there was a raid song.
[277:05.00]Oh yeah I don't know- that's why- I don't- my- my brain checked out with the worm.
[277:13.87]It's all gone.
[277:14.85]It's always funny to hear the .5 seconds people have in the voice chat in the lobby and they're just going to get their one sentence out, whatever it is.
[277:42.69]Alright, cool.
[277:51.01]Got something over here.
[278:03.72]Oh, what is this?
[278:04.64]Is this just not... Is this a weird... That's where the people used to spawn in.
[278:08.40]Remember how everybody was like...
[278:12.02]Like those little boxes on the outskirts of the map.
[278:13.84]You're just like... Well, I guess you just didn't play earlier, did you?
[278:16.68]No, I didn't.
[278:17.16]This is the first test I played.
[278:19.16]In the earlier playtest.
[278:20.34]Oh, check this out.
[278:20.84]Check this out.
[278:22.02]And fire sword.
[278:23.31]Have fun.
[278:25.81]And fire bow.
[278:29.11]I'm so afraid I'm going to hit... This thing is... The fire sword is freaking me out.
[278:32.39]I don't know.
[278:33.09]I can't... I can't... I can't fucking use it.
[278:36.15]I can't play with it.
[278:37.61]It's weird.
[278:38.99]It was a debuff.
[278:39.87]Don't give that to me again.
[278:40.73]That was a debuff.
[278:43.59]Alright, well, you know what?
[278:44.57]Honestly, I'm just going to go off the wizard.
[278:47.20]Sorry.
[278:47.60]Sorry I thought this was a good idea.
[278:49.32]It was just too... It was so foreign to me.
[278:51.30]It was too much power.
[278:52.38]It just was so foreign to me that I just... It was something I'd never seen.
[279:00.31]There's a wraith in here that I think we might be able to kill with a little bit of... Never mind.
[279:04.27]It's an awful wraith.
[279:06.43]Why can I not break this?
[279:08.01]What the fuck is going on?
[279:09.67]You just got to believe.
[279:16.79]Points incoming.
[279:17.59]Thanks, Jerma.
[279:18.37]Well, you don't know that, actually.
[279:25.41]Thanks, but no thanks.
[279:26.29]Thanks, but no thanks to what?
[279:27.77]Oh, friends.
[279:28.49]All right.
[279:28.75]Watch out.
[279:29.63]Hold on.
[279:31.07]So here's the fun part.
[279:31.91]We get to be so toxic with your arrows and my fireballs.
[279:37.05]And my axe.
[279:38.96]Thank you.
[279:39.94]And I'm dead.
[279:44.94]Beautiful.
[279:45.78]Alright, this run doesn't count.
[279:49.44]Come on.
[279:50.58]Oh, there's somebody behind me.
[279:51.32]Fuck.
[279:55.78]There's no way we're letting that happen.
[279:57.18]There's no way.
[279:57.68]I'm sorry.
[279:58.12]Nope.
[279:59.35]I'm done.
[280:01.07]It's bedtime.
[280:04.03]Get real late.
[280:06.12]I gotta go get in my crib understandable thank you stir yeah no problem games and it was nice meeting you and also thank you for the raid it was really nice yeah yeah no problem good night see you later stir thanks for playing stir is stir is stir is a good dude uh so what's your plan I I might want to do some solo goblin stuff now that I have like a cool weapon yeah absolutely
[280:31.48]But I think that's great.
[280:33.14]It's also a great way to get a lot of loot, a lot of money.
[280:35.28]Yeah.
[280:36.36]The goblin caves are fun.
[280:39.10]They are rigorous in some ways.
[280:41.10]And then like you will get like shitty teleports.
[280:43.94]So well, they just they made it better than they make it easier.
[280:47.06]They kind of nerfed a lot of stuff in it, didn't they?
[280:48.56]I think it's a lot more predictable with the circles now, so maybe.
[280:55.80]But I just went into a couple earlier, and they were still kind of weird.
[280:59.71]Cool.
[281:00.55]Well, that's good to know, because I was like, oh, they nerfed it.
[281:03.55]Now I'm going to go in and be a dickhead and die.
[281:07.19]Now, the goblins still mess you up.
[281:08.91]If you even take one hit, it's a quarter of the Barb's health, and he has the highest health.
[281:13.28]Yeah.
[281:13.80]Yeah.
[281:15.20]But yeah, it's cool to have you on stream.
[281:17.94]Thanks for playing.
[281:19.22]I mean, I'm going to probably be playing for at least another couple hours.
[281:21.28]I don't know what the plan is, but I know Kryken's got another group.
[281:23.75]I know there's other people playing too.
[281:26.01]Probably can jump around again later.
[281:27.21]I'll be playing Friday as well.
[281:29.67]Sick.
[281:30.89]Yeah, just let me know if you need me.
[281:32.25]Yeah, it was awesome hanging out with you.
[281:33.85]Thanks for coming out.
[281:34.81]And make sure we get to follow the channel and everything because you're a good dude.
[281:41.39]I appreciate that, man.
[281:42.83]I really appreciate it going on and it was a good time.
[281:45.96]Mods, show that please spam twitch.tv slash You're too nice to me.
[282:01.19]I really appreciate it.
[282:02.01]Thank you.
[282:02.51]Yeah, but take care.
[282:04.25]We'll talk to you.
[282:04.63]I'll talk to you soon.
[282:08.68]Mods?
[282:09.62]Mods?
[282:10.68]Mods?
[282:16.72]Yeah, I met him through when I went to go do the show with Charlie.
[282:21.40]He's part of that kind of group.
[282:25.63]They're all really cool.
[282:26.53]Really funny.
[282:27.03]Really awesome.
[282:27.69]So, it's cool to play with them.
[282:34.35]Oh, there we go.
[282:34.75]That's cool.
[282:39.75]So, I do want to try the new Goblin mode.
[282:46.34]At least for a little while.
[282:49.20]I'm not bringing this yet.
[282:54.71]This is staying right here.
[282:56.89]Until the last day.
[283:00.77]But, I'm just going in.
[283:03.03]You know?
[283:04.19]I know Omega Lull, he's level 20 and he sucks.
[283:06.76]Eh, whatever.
[283:07.16]Who cares?
[283:09.12]It's just a playtest.
[283:09.86]I'll be better next playtest.
[283:30.25]No one's going to carry you now.
[283:32.73]I feel like 70% of the runs we did were comedy runs, so...
[283:40.89]I think it worked out pretty well.
[283:44.23]Alright, let's go.
[283:53.21]Awful place to start, but whatever.
[284:00.95]Oh, that's not good.
[284:02.65]Oh, this is also not good.
[284:06.97]This is also bad.
[284:13.01]I am so glad I didn't bring this weander down here.
[284:15.21]I think I made it up.
[284:25.12]Ooh, he swung.
[284:26.84]Close, close, close it.
[284:28.92]This room is equally as bad.
[284:30.87]Oh my God.
[284:31.45]Okay.
[284:38.83]We're good.
[284:53.31]Come on.
[284:54.83]Come on.
[284:55.39]I bumped into the wall.
[285:00.00]Well, this is a bad start.
[285:01.28]Maybe I'll find some heals.
[285:12.22]That's pretty good.
[285:19.62]Better than...
[285:23.56]Alright, pull you over here.
[285:25.04]This time, don't get hit.
[285:31.68]I don't want to aggro the rest of the room.
[285:33.04]Come on.
[285:33.52]Get over here.
[285:33.88]Get over here.
[285:53.02]Okay, better.
[285:56.90]Hey, would you look at that?
[285:58.25]30.
[285:59.45]Look, I asked and God answered.
[286:01.85]23.
[286:18.20]I don't really know how to use this, but I'll try it.
[286:21.00]This thing is like a head bopper, right?
[286:22.38]Yeah.
[286:26.09]Okay.
[286:27.27]Give me the house.
[286:54.10]For some reason, I thought that was a guy in there.
[286:56.40]I saw, like, just the shoes.
[286:57.34]Okay.
[287:00.59]Hold on a sec.
[287:05.43]I need to move this.
[287:13.72]Hmm.
[287:15.62]Stir's stream is still on?
[287:20.88]It is.
[287:21.56]Hold on.
[287:35.81]We're not like messing around, right?
[287:43.53]Is it actually just still on?
[287:53.44]Oh, that's one of these things.
[288:08.78]Hold on.
[288:09.62]I'm just kind of walking in dying, but I actually don't want... If he doesn't know that, then I definitely want to make sure he knows.
[288:17.29]Yeah, this is more important.
[288:35.98]Give me one second.
[288:36.98]I'm going to text him.
[288:40.99]I would definitely want someone to tell me if I did that.
[288:44.27]Give me one second.
[288:46.96]I'll be right back.
[288:53.60]Concerned, Andy?
[288:55.59]No, but I mean, if you don't know that's happening, it's just like, oh, wait, what?
[288:59.23]Give me one second.
[288:59.61]I'll be right back.
[292:25.94]Just give me two more seconds.
[292:28.16]Two seconds.
[292:28.96]I just saw the subs come in.
[292:30.16]Yeah.
[292:33.37]I appreciate that.
[292:35.97]We should be giving subs to you, though.
[292:38.47]Not this way.
[292:41.28]No, it was a blast having you on.
[292:46.62]Give me two more seconds.
[292:51.38]Sometimes Twitch staff hangs out here.
[292:53.18]I don't know if anybody from Twitch staff is aware of this.
[292:56.01]Maybe they can do something about it.
[292:59.77]I don't know.
[293:00.33]Sometimes this staff lurks here.
[293:09.41]Give me one more moment.
[293:11.95]Don't worry.
[293:12.21]I'm going to be live for a while.
[293:13.55]Don't worry.
[295:11.58]Okay.
[295:14.65]I'm going to just keep playing.
[295:22.59]Hey, look.
[295:23.45]Twitch staff.
[295:28.10]Staff.
[295:34.04]Yeah, we think that Stir may have left his stream on.
[295:37.64]Possibly.
[295:39.61]Possibly.
[295:47.11]I think he did a raid and then I think just didn't turn the stream off.
[295:59.72]The worms got him.
[296:13.95]He fell asleep instantly.
[296:18.53]I mean, he did leave very quickly.
[296:21.45]It was like, yeah, yeah, okay, bye, do-do-do-do-do-do.
[296:24.08]And... Oh, he's back!
[296:26.84]Alright.
[296:28.40]Sterak came back, okay.
[296:40.00]Alright, we good?
[296:41.94]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[296:43.58]Okay.
[296:43.68]Okay.
[296:54.71]Alright, we're good.
[296:57.67]He said, huh?
[297:01.19]Bro, he's gonna go another 12 hours.
[297:03.15]He put food in the oven and took a shower.
[297:14.52]Yeah, I tried texting him.
[297:18.55]We pinged him a few times.
[297:21.63]I think we even pinged Ashley a few times, too.
[297:27.20]Alright, well, that's good.
[297:28.30]Situated.
[297:35.62]My text didn't even go through to him.
[297:37.55]Weird.
[297:40.29]Hold on, wait.
[297:41.09]Did he mean to do that and he was coming back?
[297:43.11]No.
[297:44.01]I doubt it.
[297:48.35]He got your Discord pings.
[297:49.67]Okay, good.
[297:53.25]No, dude, he has your number blocked.
[298:01.78]Alright.
[298:02.90]Alright, that's good.
[298:04.04]Let's go.
[298:12.98]Oh, my text says not delivered.
[298:15.33]Oh, that's weird.
[298:15.77]Okay.
[298:16.85]Well, we're good.
[298:29.20]Hello.
[298:29.36]Hello.
[298:37.90]Yeah, he's ending for real now.
[298:39.08]Alright, good.
[298:44.84]Yeah, trust me when I say I would want someone to do that for me, too.
[298:49.91]If I just, like, left the stream on for, like, I, yeah.
[298:53.27]It's like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, turn it off.
[298:58.11]Because you never know.
[298:59.24]Honestly, here's a little tip.
[299:02.26]You just kind of don't know, right?
[299:04.46]If you're setting a stream up, and trust me, I've been doing this before.
[299:07.22]Like, showing up hours later, and I don't know how many times I've probably sat here and fucking farted.
[299:14.00]You know what I mean?
[299:15.16]Or like, just, oh, I have no clothes on.
[299:17.37]I'm just kind of walking around in my room.
[299:19.55]You know what I mean?
[299:21.01]You just need to fucking know these things.
[299:22.39]You just need to know.
[299:27.52]You've got to know.
[299:31.17]Let's play.
[299:42.14]What the hell?
[299:45.28]I'm staying in here.
[299:56.81]How is it?
[299:59.18]I can't fight these.
[300:00.22]I have to pull them all individually into the room.
[300:05.73]Why did you come too?
[300:14.89]God damn it.
[300:16.21]Oh my god.
[300:16.99]Are we sure?
[300:19.83]Hold on.
[300:20.13]Are we sure they didn't add enemies and damage?
[300:27.64]Wait, what is he screaming in his house?
[300:30.98]What are you talking about?
[300:46.59]Wait, is it like he's doing like a bit?

[302:47.06]Okay, I actually don't want to die because that helmet is very good.
[303:06.88]That's better.
[303:07.40]I don't think I've ever used this.

[304:05.04]All right.
[304:05.86]Let's keep that on.
[304:06.54]I thought that was a player.
[304:25.85]Beat Saber mode?
[304:26.75]Yeah, that's true.
[304:29.43]Actually true.
[304:38.36]This is the loot corner.
[304:41.12]So much shit on these walls here.
[304:42.86]Uh-oh.

[305:38.71]Jeez.
[305:40.61]Alright, don't fuck this up.
[305:48.37]I just gotta find a way out, because I want to keep... That's a... That was a cool diamond.
[305:55.24]Come on down, please.
[305:55.82]Why are you all the way up in the ceiling?
[306:06.85]What?
[306:08.59]Oh, you're full of shit.
[306:12.66]Oh, my God.
[306:13.30]Just fucking run.
[306:15.14]What?
[306:15.48]This is... That enemy is so fucking weird.
[306:17.36]I swear to God.
[306:26.18]The thing is glued to the ceiling and then comes down and goes...
[306:37.34]What have you done?
[306:38.26]Why did you bring all this shit down here?
[306:39.44]Fucking stuck in the wall.
[306:48.52]What the fuck, dude?
[306:49.74]I literally couldn't even move.
[306:50.82]I was literally stuck.
[306:54.33]I couldn't walk.
[306:58.27]Fuck that bug.
[307:01.47]I was fine, too.
[307:11.51]Pain in the ass.
[307:30.08]Good night, Irene.
[307:32.70]I jumped into it.
[307:44.12]At least you aren't losing stuff.
[307:47.38]Well, he kind of just had the same idea where he was just like, you know what?
[307:50.74]We're just dead, so one of us is going to die.
[307:53.42]You know what?
[307:54.00]I would have rather he killed me.
[307:55.80]He knew, too, that one of us was going to get embarrassed getting stuck in that corner, and he didn't want it to be him.
[308:01.71]So he got the easy way out.
[308:09.61]He married into it.
[308:17.68]Hmm.
[308:47.64]It is sore though.
[308:54.06]Okay.
[308:54.66]Somebody asked why do the skeletons have blood?
[308:56.48]Bone marrow.
[308:56.88]You know where your blood comes from?
[308:58.42]Bone marrow.
[309:19.69]I feel like I'm... This is going to be a never-ending spider thing because my weapon is not... Are you still living?
[309:28.87]Why are you still among the living?
[309:30.03]Alright, just don't go that way.
[309:35.46]Your blood comes from your heart.
[309:40.24]Um... Your... What?
[309:46.96]What are you talking about?
[309:51.47]Your heart pumps it.
[310:00.36]It actually comes from Marrow.
[310:11.85]Blood cells are made in the bone marrow.
[310:13.90]The bone marrow is the soft spongy material in the center of the bones.
[310:16.86]It produces about 95% of the body's blood cells.
[310:19.90]Most of the adult body's bone marrow is in the pelvic bones, breastbone, and the bones of the spine.
[310:24.98]Time that person out for 10 minutes.
[310:45.20]Somebody's coming over that way.
[310:56.68]It's gonna get bad, isn't it?
[311:00.76]He hears all this too.
[311:02.82]He's probably listening to the door.
[311:06.18]Yeah.
[311:18.06]Are we cool?
[311:31.58]Alright, you're cool.
[311:47.21]I'm not gonna kill you.
[311:47.91]I'm just following you.
[311:49.47]That sounds weird, but... Pretend to be fighting me.
[312:04.44]Pretend to be fighting me.
[312:09.38]Get back here!
[312:09.84]Yeah, pretend to be fighting me so we can trick somebody.
[312:18.55]Don't even think about it.
[312:20.09]Oh, no.
[312:20.49]Uh-oh.
[312:23.03]Ooh.
[312:28.43]Oh, it didn't work.
[312:28.91]I thought someone was coming through the door.
[312:33.27]And then get him!
[312:37.09]Well, that was fun for a minute.
[312:39.33]We have to be in this room.
[312:40.53]This is awful.
[312:41.27]Uh, I'm gonna go around.
[312:45.08]I don't want to deal with that side.
[312:47.67]I don't have any items.
[312:48.66]What the fuck have I been doing?
[313:37.90]Alright, I just need to find a portal.
[313:39.28]I really didn't do anything this round.
[313:40.72]I kind of just walked around in a circle.
[313:42.16]So many concentrated enemies right there.
[313:46.17]I need to at least get some loot or something.
[313:52.61]There are so many people that are left, dude.
[314:08.46]Still aggroed on him.
[314:09.26]Nice one.
[314:38.52]Alright.
[314:39.94]Nice job.
[314:52.73]Alright, we gotta... I mean... Ooh!
[314:55.07]Alright.
[314:58.11]What do we got?
[315:00.87]Something good?
[315:04.39]Ooh!
[315:16.77]Hey, may your journeys be long, your ale fresh, and your carrots crunchy, and your stew hot, and your goblins easy to slay, and your friends plentiful.
[315:30.73]Alright, you go.
[315:31.89]You go.
[315:34.01]I have nothing.
[315:35.09]I literally have no reason to go through that.
[315:45.48]Like, I really just don't.
[315:46.78]I mean, 10 gold maybe?
[315:48.24]There's a lot of people left for how tiny this circle is.
[315:55.76]I'm the last one?
[316:09.15]Oh, no, I'm not.
[316:14.43]There's like three people left.
[316:15.73]I just wanted a portal.
[316:28.44]Oh, wait.
[316:29.80]I heard one.
[316:31.31]I think it was above, though.
[316:37.67]Yeah, it was above.
[316:39.53]That's okay.
[316:41.41]I should have just dropped all my shit and he could have just taken it.
[316:45.81]It's alright.
[316:55.07]The next adventurer.
[317:09.20]That was fun.
[317:16.53]You can make it if you run.
[317:20.23]If there was something good in that treasure chest, then I'm glad that somebody got it.
[317:34.72]At my last message from Stir, like 15 minutes ago, kind of disrespectful to ask me to end stream.
[317:40.44]It wasn't even bad.
[317:41.33]Hello?
[317:44.41]Hi.
[317:58.35]Well.
[318:07.61]He's such a shit.
[318:09.88]Oh, hi, 10 enemies.
[318:31.43]There really are so many.
[318:35.95]You weren't even close.
[318:40.59]Alright, that's a pretty decent amount of money to start with.
[318:55.23]I gotta try to just get out of here.
[319:17.50]Oh, a diamond.
[319:21.34]Oh, if only I had somebody to guide me.
[319:24.56]If only somebody was around to show me the way.
[319:37.29]Stuck down here in a dungeon.
[319:39.25]If only there was an adventurer that could help me.
[319:46.60]The promise of jewels was not enough.
[319:50.80]Oh, if only there was an adventurer that could come and help me and accept my quest.
[320:00.19]Oh my god, dude.
[320:15.94]Oh, thank you for accepting my quest.
[320:18.58]Oh, it's been very cold down here.
[320:22.24]Where are you two... Where are you off to?
[320:25.23]Oh, if only they... All right, we need to... Oh, God, there's too many people.
[320:37.07]Oh, dear.
[320:38.03]The dungeon is so... So strong, brothers.
[320:40.23]So dark down here.
[320:42.85]If anyone were to lead me to a portal...
[320:45.93]I have a diamond that they will have if they complete my quest.
[320:50.74]Hurrying behind you.
[320:51.26]No, it's safe, it is safe.
[320:51.84]See, it's green jello.
[321:17.44]So much mountain dew.
[321:22.20]Hooray!
[321:22.62]Hooray!
[321:23.25]Hooray!
[321:23.97]Oh, the poison!
[321:26.33]The poison stings!
[321:28.09]Does anyone have a- Close the door behind us!
[321:31.87]We're fucking dead.
[321:33.87]There's no way we're getting through this.
[321:36.15]Oh my god, that's so slow!
[321:40.08]Oh shit, I almost just closed the door on him.
[321:44.69]Would any of you happen to have a healing pot?
[321:46.47]Watch out behind you.
[321:47.63]There's a mummy.
[321:50.19]And a bug.
[321:51.75]And a snake.
[322:00.86]Please.
[322:01.74]If you get it out alive, I have a diamond on me.
[322:04.39]Even though you failed.
[322:11.02]There's so many things.
[322:13.48]We're just being followed by 25 enemies.
[322:17.98]I want to be an escort quest for somebody so bad.
[322:29.16]I would be willing to give anybody all of my items if they would escort me to a portal.
[322:33.28]Find me.
[322:34.82]Find me if you could.
[322:35.74]Okay.
[322:38.60]You're mean.
[322:54.16]Okay.
[322:54.72]I need to find like a blue diamond and then just be a quest for somebody.
[322:58.48]I'm into that right now.
[323:02.84]I'm down on the southern end of the map.
[323:06.29]I don't know how far my voice travels.
[323:33.00]Dude, next time I'm just gonna bring like 15 bandages and like 25 potions.
[323:37.51]Come on, stuck in a corner.
[323:40.93]Oh my goodness, these fucking enemies.
[323:44.91]Jesus.
[323:59.82]There we go.
[324:00.28]A magical amulet.
[324:14.59]Oh my god, there's so much gear over here.
[324:15.97]I can do it.
[324:17.25]Just don't die.
[324:17.75]Look at all this shit over here.
[324:24.29]What are you doing?
[324:26.11]What the hell is this person?
[324:27.47]What are you doing?
[324:29.01]What were you doing?
[324:33.67]Look at all these.
[324:34.53]Oh my god.
[324:35.13]This is such a quest reward.
[324:45.20]I need an adventurer to help me get out of the dungeon!
[324:48.94]I have gold!
[324:51.22]I have trinkets!
[324:53.96]I need some help to get out of the dungeon!
[324:55.74]I have plenty of goods!
[324:59.14]Is anyone out there?
[325:07.40]Can anybody hear me?
[325:08.47]I need an escort out of the dungeon!
[325:17.05]Anyone?
[325:18.51]Can anyone hear me?
[325:19.41]I need an escort out of the dungeon, please!
[325:29.62]I have gold!
[325:33.76]I have treasure!
[325:47.01]If anyone's out there... I have gold, I have jewels... I need an escort out of the dungeon!
[325:54.22]Please!
[325:54.58]Fuck these bugs!
[326:03.89]They're the worst!
[326:18.57]I'm on the lower level!
[326:19.63]Oh, there's no one here to help me.
[326:34.72]Is there anyone that will help me?
[326:46.82]Adventura!
[326:47.50]Adventura, I need help!
[326:52.93]Oh, there's a lot of fucking spiders here!
[326:58.55]Oh!
[327:02.01]Adventura!
[327:03.03]If you- That's a fucking enemy.
[327:14.30]I just saw the shield.
[327:22.63]We're doing a real one this time.
[327:28.27]Well, howdy there.
[327:30.37]I need an escort out of the dungeon.
[327:31.80]I will pay gold and jewels if you can please find me.
[327:34.24]I will go to the southern end of the map.
[327:36.02]Please.
[327:37.16]Please!
[327:37.56]Okay.
[327:41.24]That was such a reluctant okay.
[327:42.90]That was the most reluctant okay I've ever heard.
[327:44.40]I was like, uh...
[327:51.56]I'm gonna die on my way over there.
[327:52.94]I hope he finds my body.
[327:58.31]Quest accepted.
[327:59.73]Alright, I gotta get to the south end of the map.
[328:07.55]Please!
[328:08.86]Oh, I can't believe it.
[328:12.08]Will you accept my quest?
[328:15.08]Sure.
[328:16.06]Okay, I don't know very much about the dungeon.
[328:18.38]All I know is that I don't want to be down here.
[328:20.14]It smells.
[328:23.14]Yeah, yeah, that's fair.
[328:26.81]I see you're a wizard.
[328:28.97]Very helpful.
[328:31.63]Oh, yeah.
[328:35.69]Careful.
[328:37.05]This dungeon is known to have all kinds... Adventurer!
[328:39.83]There are goblins!
[328:41.83]Adventurer!
[328:43.61]Get back, get back!
[328:48.46]Careful with the great power of Phineas Davidson.
[328:54.73]I smacked you!
[328:59.93]Oh my goodness!
[329:04.69]Behind you!
[329:10.82]Look out!
[329:17.78]Good swinging!
[329:21.96]Hey, you hurt?
[329:30.51]These caves have so many scary things in them.
[329:35.13]When I was younger, I used to explore here.
[329:39.90]Onward!
[329:40.70]Alright, alright.
[329:46.02]Well, that way seems dangerous.
[329:48.31]It does.
[329:50.59]I would say we should probably go south.
[329:58.16]I remember when I was in the poison swamp one time.
[330:03.14]The amount of damage and disease it causes.
[330:08.54]One would be sick in a moment's notice being down here.
[330:13.34]Truly a disgusting... Adventurer!
[330:16.25]Goblins are afoot!
[330:28.11]Don't let him run!
[330:35.16]Poisonous.
[330:36.70]Very, very disgusting.
[330:38.36]Anyone would take five points of damage if they walked down here.
[330:44.95]Adventurer!
[330:45.51]Goblins!
[331:09.34]Hold on, I know it.
[331:14.78]These halls are full of all kinds of dangerous things.
[331:21.55]Ah, that feels better.
[331:27.93]Ah, that feels better.
[331:32.73]Oh my god, is it you?
[331:34.71]That feels better.
[331:35.65]Alright.
[331:44.17]We are safe here.
[331:46.95]The dungeon was built back in 1500 BC.
[331:55.31]It stood for many years.
[331:57.99]Poison is actually dragon's breath, if you didn't know.
[332:03.00]Five million years ago, the dragon Allura died down here.
[332:08.43]And their spit is what causes most of the poison, if you didn't know.
[332:15.22]Adventurer!
[332:16.16]Goblins!
[332:20.48]Come on!
[332:21.55]Come on!
[332:22.03]Come on!
[332:41.26]A portal!
[332:43.58]There's the portal!
[332:52.44]The portal!
[332:53.62]There's the portal!
[332:59.24]Want to leave.
[333:04.94]The dragon breathed 4,000% five million years ago.
[333:09.48]I thank you for helping me.
[333:14.19]Listen, don't forget about me, General.
[333:16.83]Don't forget about me.
[333:18.33]Here is your shitty reward.
[333:20.11]No!
[333:20.63]He took it.
[333:24.30]Here's your shitty reward for your level one quest.
[333:29.26]Thank you.
[333:29.60]Thank you.
[333:30.34]I will go in the portal now.
[333:33.76]Uh, he took it.
[333:38.35]Uh, hello?
[333:47.63]Hey, there's people here.
[333:49.67]Adventurer!
[333:50.37]Goblins!
[333:56.26]Use the strength of a thousand suns!
[334:02.98]Here, take this adventurer.
[334:05.12]You could use it.
[334:06.54]Oh shit, he escaped.
[334:19.21]Bander!
[334:20.44]Come back!
[334:22.06]Come back!
[334:29.20]The dragon 5,000 years ago was... The shittiest NPC of any fucking game ever.
[334:43.92]Hey, they played along.
[334:53.27]It was fun.
[334:53.59]All right, let's do a real one.
[335:08.74]Oh, the dragon... Aloro?
[335:10.33]I don't even know what the dragon's name was.
[335:37.97]You could have donated those 75.
[335:40.99]Do you mean?
[335:41.37]Hold on.
[335:41.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[335:42.81]I just want to make sure I'm very clear what you're asking me.
[335:44.89]Are you talking about the family guy?
[335:48.56]Money from 10 years ago?
[335:52.78]Why are you bringing that up right now?
[336:18.06]anything anything okay easy good good start let's go I ain't going that way actually did I just get one yeah I did okay
[337:06.48]Don't screw this up.
[337:08.22]It's really easy to screw it up in solo.
[337:25.67]You always think it's safe, and it never is.
[337:40.16]I just wanna pull... Okay, come on.
[337:43.06]Through the door and then I'm gonna close it.
[337:47.19]That's how you do it.
[337:47.83]Cool.
[338:08.60]There we go.
[338:17.63]That's actually really good for a green.
[338:20.09]Oh, shit.
[338:24.01]Oh, come on.
[338:25.33]I didn't want to press that button, and I did.
[338:26.83]I didn't mean to.
[338:27.69]Oh, don't panic.
[338:28.85]Just fucking go.
[338:29.49]I fucked it up.
[338:30.22]I was so afraid of going back into this room.
[338:48.70]God damn it.
[338:54.56]This is not going like terribly.
[339:01.15]This weapon is really good though.
[339:02.41]For green.
[339:03.51]I don't want to lose it.
[339:04.65]Fuck.
[339:16.17]Open, open, open, open, open, open, open.
[339:19.44]Okay.
[339:19.62]Somebody was already here.
[339:38.47]Oh my god.
[339:40.53]Oh, thank god.
[339:53.59]A lot of stuff running down here.
[339:55.14]I got to look for a portal.
[340:00.70]Oh, yeah.
[340:10.42]Strength to these have stats.
[340:21.80]six agility where are you oh here's a gun what oh somebody closed it you got a shield I don't want to with that
[341:14.59]You can have half.
[341:15.21]That's how it works.
[341:16.41]You can have half.
[341:19.45]I was hoping he was going to just attack me.
[341:21.01]I just took way more than half.
[341:42.01]No, this is yours.
[341:42.65]I took way more than that.
[341:53.31]Trader Andy.
[342:03.76]What is going on?
[342:04.32]Oh, I thought you were swinging at me.
[342:05.92]It's alright.
[342:06.94]Be safe.
[342:07.38]I don't have much, but whatever.
[342:13.64]I do want to get out with this weapon.
[342:23.43]Nice work.
[342:27.89]Oh, shit.
[342:28.81]It's too dark.
[342:36.42]Oh, boy.
[342:38.44]This is very bad.
[342:47.86]I'm stuck.
[342:48.43]I'm stuck.
[342:51.96]Oh, fuck.
[342:52.81]Look out!
[342:53.63]Be careful!
[342:56.37]I'm gonna bleed to death, aren't I?
[342:57.47]Oh, they're right here!
[342:58.17]Be careful!
[343:04.29]It's not safe!
[343:11.87]You literally saved my life.
[343:19.00]Before we leave, I'm gonna give you a trinket.
[343:38.15]Is this the last portal?
[343:38.93]I don't know if there's any more.
[344:07.45]There's one more.
[344:08.11]It'll spawn when it's closing again.
[344:09.35]Okay, good to know.
[344:26.42]Shit, there's no portal in here.
[344:27.46]This is so annoying.
[344:28.40]It's probably up.
[344:30.29]That's so annoying.
[344:30.87]The portal's probably up.
[344:37.43]Okay, cool.
[344:46.34]I mean, didn't really get very much, but I did.
[344:48.60]I actually really want to hold on to this.
[344:49.78]This thing's pretty good.
[344:50.32]I feel like I haven't traded anything to the merchant in like an hour and a half.
[345:08.35]No, no, no, no.
[345:08.85]Keep those.
[345:14.14]Keep those, too.
[345:15.38]Get rid of these.
[345:26.26]Ten, one strength.
[345:31.15]I mean, that's kind of good, though.
[345:39.37]Only three gold.
[345:40.05]That's kind of terrible.
[345:57.89]Let me get rid of some of the silver.
[346:10.90]I know people are saying to buy these, but I like having... Not yet.
[346:14.27]I don't need it yet.
[346:20.31]Once this comes down to halfway, then yeah.
[346:29.40]I'm ready to show this off to anybody.
[346:31.70]But I'm afraid to use it.
[346:45.35]Uh, I'm gonna do it again.
[346:47.27]I have gear.
[346:49.81]Actually, I'm gonna buy some potions and stuff.
[347:02.54]Bandages.
[347:03.00]Okay, let's go.
[347:24.92]There's four portals now.
[347:27.72]That's good.
[347:29.49]That's actually really good.
[347:47.10]My chat went down.
[348:00.36]Nice.
[348:00.58]No, really?
[348:04.18]Oh, don't even.
[348:04.74]Trying to hit them both.
[348:33.19]Well, glad I brought these.
[348:45.61]I did it.
[348:46.41]I killed the goblin king.
[348:48.93]I've done it.
[348:49.73]That wasn't the king.
[348:51.35]That's a lackey.
[348:52.07]You don't fucking know what you're doing.
[348:59.07]Nah, dude, I killed the king.
[349:00.59]Yeah, I killed the king earlier.
[349:02.17]It was me.
[349:06.45]I killed the king earlier.
[349:07.23]You didn't kill the king.
[349:07.79]It was me that did it.
[349:09.49]Here, take this.
[349:15.70]A sapphire.
[349:16.06]It's on the ground right here.
[349:42.14]I'm a cleric, so like, if you ever need like patching up, little, you know.

[351:34.36]No, wait, how did he die?
[351:35.80]Oh, no!
[351:39.03]He stopped talking!
[351:39.89]I was about to- I was gonna do like a- I was gonna do a face turn.

[352:00.68]I hit him?
[352:01.14]No, I didn't.
[352:01.60]I was just trying to be like the weird guy in the dungeon.
[352:09.32]Get me off voice chat.
[352:10.42]I can't play the game with this proximity chat.
[352:27.12]Turn it off.
[352:28.54]I have to stop this.
[352:45.27]Just closing the door and then he opens the door I'm just standing there at the end of the hallway One normal round Turn it back on
[353:20.63]There.
[353:28.37]I'm not gonna do an Elmo RP.
[353:30.44]You're trying to like make a 10,000 people leave.
[353:53.37]Oh my god, how did that not reach?
[353:55.25]Actually, thanks.
[353:56.45]That helped.
[353:56.79]Why am I so slow?
[354:08.49]Oh, that's a debuff.
[354:09.29]Oh no, you're going to heal, aren't you?
[354:19.30]Cool, but I can't use it.
[354:38.13]Damn it.
[354:46.52]Somebody's coming.
[354:49.34]Crouch.
[354:53.70]RP where you pretend to be really good.
[354:56.18]Try that.
[355:12.93]That was- I'm sorry, I probably just woke somebody up.
[355:14.49]Dammit.
[355:56.49]I just lost a fucking torch.
[355:58.87]That's all that happened.
[356:16.29]I'm not... No.
[356:18.31]This room is awful.
[356:29.10]Um, I'm gonna go up.
[356:44.44]God damn it.
[356:45.99]It's a junk.
[357:01.41]Spongebob RP?
[357:02.65]Look at all this crap.
[357:05.94]I have to get out of here.
[357:14.11]Shit.
[357:39.26]shit how I'm how do I get up there I don't how can I get up there I think I'm like trapped
[358:29.96]I'm gonna die.
[358:44.06]We're good.
[358:45.44]That was pretty close.
[358:55.79]Any scraps?
[358:58.67]Oh my goodness.
[359:14.65]Am I invisible?
[359:19.09]Where the fuck are the exits?
[359:21.72]I don't know.
[359:23.80]Ow!
[359:24.02]Did you just get caved in on?
[359:29.24]Yeah, there's so many.
[359:30.66]Wait, what?
[359:36.16]Wait, not my Nila.
[359:37.18]He got it.
[359:40.86]Bro, where are these exits?
[359:41.76]There's supposed to be four, right?
[359:43.54]Yeah.
[359:44.06]I think there's one more.
[360:15.49]What the fuck was that?
[360:21.09]Was that Elmo?
[360:21.79]That was weird.
[360:28.25]Who is doing that?
[360:29.05]Shut up.
[360:37.19]Is it anybody else?
[360:39.63]No, it's just this guy.
[360:44.52]It had to be me.
[360:51.84]There's nobody else in the lobby.
[360:53.18]It had to be me.
[360:53.92]I thought there was two or three people left.
[361:04.65]You have to watch him.
[361:11.31]Let's see if he can escape.
[361:20.09]I wish you luck.
[361:27.18]I think you're gonna get out.
[361:35.95]Yeah, there we go.
[361:37.09]It's all good.
[361:39.39]GG.
[361:51.25]I'm going to throw a little bit of a curveball here.
[361:52.67]I'm going to do one more round.
[361:54.63]Yeah, look, I didn't really get anything.
[361:57.50]I'm going to try a different class.
[361:58.36]I'm going to go level one.
[362:00.22]Not that it matters, but... That's the wrong button.
[362:28.05]You can sell from the stash?
[362:29.25]Really?
[362:33.49]Will I play the Metroid remaster?
[362:34.82]I never played Metroid Prime.
[362:39.18]It always looked interesting, but... Just was something I never really grasped.
[362:47.27]For me, the Wii was always... All the FPSs that were on Wii were so good.
[362:54.44]Resident Evil 4 for the Wii is my favorite version of that game.
[362:57.42]Obviously, before it came to PC.
[362:58.84]But even... I don't know.
[362:59.74]Even still, I really liked it on Wii.
[363:04.09]It was really fun to aim with it.
[363:05.81]It seemed pretty responsive.
[363:17.14]Alright, let me do... Let me do one in the normal place.
[363:23.95]But then after this I'm going to change.
[363:41.70]Wizard?
[363:42.00]I don't know if I'm a wizard player.
[363:48.98]I usually like to play casters and RPGs or whatever, but
[363:53.85]Feels like there's a lot of micromanagement with Wizard.
[363:55.42]I'd rather just swing at stuff.
[364:23.90]You can't come through that, no.
[364:36.29]Do a golem RP.
[364:51.55]um armor or magic now I mean I'll hold on to these oh let me in there
[365:17.78]I feel like that's really, really, really good.
[365:20.06]It's just one of those unbelievable stat things.
[365:23.20]That's really good.
[365:24.02]I actually don't want to lose now.
[365:28.31]Not like I wanted to before, but you know.
[365:52.95]Damn.
[365:53.39]Okay, this is what I'm talking about.
[365:54.35]Cool.
[366:08.04]Oh my god.
[366:08.74]Alright, after this, if this is good, I'm just gonna literally sneak around.
[366:11.26]Eh.
[366:49.95]RP is your drunk?
[367:02.08]That's gonna be so annoying.
[367:28.07]I don't even know how to play.
[367:29.23]I don't even know where the hell to go.
[367:33.45]I don't even know where to go.
[367:37.82]Down here?
[367:38.24]I don't know.
[367:55.63]There's literally no way for me to go.
[367:58.79]I tried to do the drunk RP.
[368:00.51]I don't know where to go.
[368:02.55]And I was just... Drunk RP means easy kill.
[368:06.49]Yes.
[368:07.33]I'm realizing this right now.
[368:11.12]That's... Hey, let's do shit face.
[368:13.68]He probably has no idea what he's doing.
[368:16.00]Just kill him.
[368:30.51]Destroyed.
[368:31.59]Just act crazy.
[368:40.64]That was some good shit too.
[368:43.22]The mistake was going into that room.
[368:44.58]I should have just turned around and ran.
[369:04.87]Stop.
[369:06.69]Wait.
[369:07.17]I got health here.
[369:07.79]Whatever.
[369:08.49]Oh my god.
[369:23.98]Okay.
[369:24.38]Good start.
[369:25.19]Good start.
[369:31.89]I'm going to take that in a little bit.
[369:44.00]I have to play really, really passively.
[369:57.14]Where's the spawner?
[370:02.90]I forgot to buy potions again.
[370:04.74]I'm going this way.
[370:34.38]Okay.
[370:39.98]I hear somebody.
[371:16.55]Oh, shit.
[371:18.72]Where's the lever?
[372:18.57]What the fuck?
[372:19.87]Stream sniper!
[372:20.79]Stream sniper!
[372:21.79]Stream sniper!
[372:22.75]Stream sniper!
[372:36.16]Actually, no.
[372:37.28]I'm gonna stay here.
[372:58.64]Got me right in the head, too.
[372:59.78]There's stuff in here.
[373:08.75]Is that locked?
[373:16.57]Oh, my God.
[373:17.47]Oh, my God.
[373:18.69]I'm dead.
[373:19.09]I...
[373:24.03]I... I don't know, man.
[373:25.71]Like, that just did almost my whole... That just killed me in one hit almost.
[373:31.19]How do... Alright.
[373:32.24]How do you fight those as melee?
[373:35.22]I feel like they just blow up the area, like, 15 feet in front of them.
[373:39.50]How do you fight those mages as melee?
[373:44.67]You... You have to jump dodge?
[373:47.43]You don't.
[373:48.33]You run.
[373:48.65]You have to bait the shot.
[373:51.31]Alright.
[373:52.65]That was an elite too.
[373:53.64]Yeah.
[374:15.12]Let's fucking go.
[374:52.18]Don't ever buy Grace.
[374:53.04]I don't care.
[374:56.26]I'm going hard right now.
[374:59.48]And I'm getting out.
[375:07.65]Hey.
[375:08.91]Like we were saying earlier.
[375:09.75]Beta ends in three, four days.
[375:13.45]Whatever.
[375:14.29]Whatever.
[375:35.49]Are we ready?
[375:44.49]This is a big deal.
[375:46.05]I'm about to do this in the goblin zone.
[375:50.22]And by the way, I ain't fucking around.
[375:53.10]I ain't friends with anybody.
[375:54.88]Nobody is friends.
[375:55.66]I'm not friends with anybody.
[375:57.04]I think I'm ready.
[376:06.79]It's locked in now.
[376:23.96]Every single person is my enemy.
[376:26.52]I'm not wasting any time.
[376:28.55]Congratulations to the stream snipers that now are going to get a nice sword, by the way.
[376:34.07]Or, you gotta get me.
[376:35.58]You gotta kill me, by the way.
[376:43.35]I'm gonna be silent as well.
[377:29.08]What do you got?
[377:30.72]Good start.
[377:44.57]After these chests, I'm going right in the middle.
[378:24.20]Holy shit, there is a potion.
[378:25.63]Good eyes.
[379:18.42]I'm on a way out.
[379:37.89]He ducked!
[379:38.74]His animation... STOP!
[379:41.46]His animation made him duck.
[379:43.14]That was weird.
[380:45.91]Start looking for portals.
[380:48.44]Really soon here.
[380:49.04]This thing is fucking unbelievably good.
[381:24.70]All right, portal time.
[382:39.64]I made it!
[382:46.65]I had a choice and that was to open the portal and take a hit or lose the portal.
[382:59.63]Thank God.
[383:00.05]Okay.
[383:06.11]My adrenaline is like on fire.
[383:07.75]It's just so, oh my goodness, because you don't want to lose this thing, right?
[383:11.50]Oh my God.
[383:12.20]Okay, let's put it away for another three days.
[383:35.16]I might actually... Oh, I don't have a weapon now.
[383:59.22]Oops.
[384:12.68]Buy one?
[384:13.00]We should gamble.
[384:15.10]Actually, yeah.
[384:15.62]What do we got?
[384:21.45]Hmm.
[384:23.77]Try to gamble for, like, a decent weapon?
[384:26.41]Or... I'll try it.
[384:31.92]Alright.
[384:33.36]Do a well dandy.
[384:35.80]I'm alright with this.
[384:45.01]Thankfully, I didn't die, so I get to keep the potions and everything.
[384:50.44]I think I'm good to go.
[384:56.22]This is pretty good.
[385:00.12]Yeah, let's do it again.
[385:09.83]Oh, shit.
[385:10.21]I don't have any torches.
[385:18.02]any feedback for the game um I think I think it's in a really close spot I think that some of the there's obviously some of the weird bugs when you click to swing or click to block and it doesn't happen or sometimes you just get stuck swinging permanently um I really don't have torches this is kind of awful besides like the like gameplay wise
[385:47.27]I mean, I would obviously like to see more.
[385:50.25]I really like the PvE stuff.
[386:00.32]I'd like to see Elmo.
[386:01.54]Like an officially licensed Elmo boss.
[386:05.76]I don't think that's asking a lot.
[386:07.92]Which, I mean, a lot of people might think it is.
[386:10.22]What?
[386:10.52]I thought somebody just hit me in the head.
[386:22.21]Pick it up.
[386:22.53]Am I crazy or is this not?
[386:27.48]This coin doesn't exist.
[386:52.14]Let's get this out of the way right now.
[387:00.71]Deal.
[387:23.98]Anything?
[387:24.26]You got anything?
[387:24.96]Ooh, okay.
[387:25.52]I'll take it.
[387:28.12]That's it?
[387:35.99]Oh!
[387:36.09]Oh my god, it scares me every time.
[387:38.19]I swear to god.
[387:41.27]That's good.
[387:42.01]Pick it up.
[387:51.65]Yeah, I'll get the torches.
[387:52.84]That's a good idea.
[388:03.11]Got a lot of heals.
[388:03.91]That's why I'm doing this so much.
[388:07.45]Oh shit, I gotta go.
[388:27.15]I think they're above.
[388:42.14]That's a big, scary, red bug.
[388:46.58]Somebody in here.
[388:47.24]They're up top.
[389:09.40]Oh my god!
[389:10.26]Oh, fuck.
[389:12.32]I... I slowed... I fucked up.
[389:15.44]I saw the fucking guy behind him, and I just... I thought that boss was gonna... So here's what happened.
[389:23.09]I saw the boss running at him.
[389:24.71]I thought he was gonna back up.
[389:27.17]I didn't think he was gonna just be swinging, swinging, swinging.
[389:29.09]I thought he was gonna back up and get hit by the boss.
[389:33.28]I didn't know.
[389:33.62]He was just walking forward and just clicking.
[389:36.80]I thought he was gonna back up.
[389:37.66]I played that wrong.
[389:41.44]You stopped attacking.
[389:43.08]Alright, I do have a complaint.
[389:44.40]Here's a game complaint.
[389:46.19]The dual-weld swinging is weird as fuck.
[389:51.07]It's like, right-click, left-click, it feels weird.
[389:54.53]There's something about it that just feels off.
[390:00.37]Because, like, I'll swing twice and then try to start my swing combination again and I just don't do anything.
[390:04.94]It'll be like, one, two, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, one, two,
[390:13.22]I'm not doing dual weld anymore.
[390:20.17]The amount of times you have to click with a dual weld, it's like left click, right click, right click, left click, right click, left click.
[390:25.31]One of those clicks ain't going to work.
[390:29.73]You can hold left click.
[390:32.33]What?
[390:39.85]Wait, I hold right click or left click?
[390:42.03]Because when I try to do left click, it just swings the left hand.
[390:44.47]It doesn't swing the other one.
[390:45.73]Hold down both buttons.
[390:50.37]Hold both left and right at the same time.
[390:55.05]What?
[391:02.80]Hold right click, then hold left click.
[391:07.27]I just wish I could just hit, I don't know, I wish I could just click, left click, and swing them both.
[391:12.19]Every other weapon in the game is left click.
[391:16.07]Whatever.
[391:16.45]I'm just going with nothing.
[391:38.82]Everything else is a single weapon.
[391:45.75]Yeah, it's just finicky to do left click and right click at the same time or differently.
[391:51.27]It just feels weird.
[391:55.47]That's my opinion.
[391:56.09]If you don't like it, then you know what to do.
[392:06.64]I beg you for forgiveness and hoping that you don't hate me.
[392:40.09]It's the next day?
[392:41.05]Yeah.
[392:42.25]I told you this was going to be an Omega stream.
[392:45.33]All I meant it.
[392:54.39]That's a lot of spiders.
[393:08.28]Where is that?
[393:08.74]Okay.
[393:08.92]It's right there.
[393:17.16]Do you get no loot for the bugs?
[393:28.95]Like the spiders?
[393:32.84]What the fuck?
[393:33.96]Why?
[393:45.98]Look at this trail of spiders.
[393:47.78]How many of these do I have to get?
[393:49.24]Get it!
[393:50.78]God damn it!
[394:05.05]Okay.
[394:06.89]Yeah, that was worth it.
[394:13.58]thought experience oh yeah that's good very true very true I hear somebody
[394:49.29]Hurry up.
[394:50.35]I spent so much time killing those spiders.
[394:52.03]Someone's mining in here.
[395:08.70]This room sucks.
[395:09.42]I'm just gonna go across.
[395:10.22]I'm coming to get you!
[395:14.96]I'm coming to get you!
[395:15.46]I'm coming to get you!
[395:36.26]Oh my goodness, look at all this shit in here.
[395:38.02]I got hit by something really awful.
[395:57.94]No heals.
[395:59.00]Fuck.
[396:01.02]I want that shit so bad in there.
[396:10.92]I don't know what that means.
[396:12.44]That's not the crouch crouch.
[396:13.52]I don't know what that means.
[396:14.20]Oh, good.
[396:48.73]How did I fall down before he did?
[396:51.45]What's going on?
[397:19.57]Where is it?
[397:19.89]I just heard it.
[397:31.72]You are decked out.
[397:32.58]Damn.
[397:34.28]Be careful.
[397:53.67]Mark.
[398:41.58]I don't have my heal anymore.
[398:42.44]If I... Okay, if I go up this... Can I... Hopefully I can turn around.
[398:48.27]Whatever.
[398:48.67]It's worth.
[398:49.11]Who cares?
[398:53.61]Help!
[398:54.33]No!
[398:54.65]I'm not going... I'm not doing that.
[398:55.57]I'm not doing that.
[398:58.67]Did he hear me?
[399:13.34]Fuck.
[399:14.00]Oh, okay.
[399:14.42]I guess I'm doing it.
[399:20.38]Where?
[399:22.87]Oh, no.
[399:23.21]No, I don't know.
[399:24.93]I don't know.
[399:25.25]It just spawned.
[399:36.26]This, this two right here.
[399:38.84]What's the, it's got to be some kind of mathematical equation where they cannot be like five feet fucking next to each other.
[399:45.42]There has to be some kind of mathematics they can, spawning right next to each other.
[399:59.95]It should be at least 50 to 100 feet apart.
[400:22.08]They spawn within the circles?
[400:24.78]I mean, me and that guy were walking around in circles for a full minute or two.
[400:28.81]And the fucking bugleberry over there had two spawn next to him.
[401:00.99]That's life in the dungeon, bro.
[401:03.25]Yeah.
[401:05.51]Oh, no, I know.
[401:06.15]Doesn't mean I can't die and just complain about it.
[401:28.03]Do you have Bugleberry RP?
[401:32.89]I can change class after this.
[401:36.03]Okay, actually getting... This is a bait coin.
[401:46.88]Been bugged the whole time.
[401:49.68]Oh my goodness.
[402:09.02]Blue.
[402:09.88]Whatever.
[402:31.43]Oh shit.
[402:31.67]Okay, this could be good.
[402:37.41]I strafed that.
[403:27.09]WHAT?!
[403:27.49]I hit you in the head five fucking times in a row!
[403:49.89]What the heck?
[403:51.99]What the fuck?
[403:55.73]Does my weapon just suck?
[404:00.87]bad weapon I mean how many headshots from a 22 what 22 damage two four six eight ten I mean well that would have to have been a hundred plus how much was that pre-potion
[404:26.36]Alright, there was at least three or four times in a row where it was like, headshot, back up, headshot, back up, headshot, back up.
[404:34.53]I get hit twice and I'm dead.
[404:35.87]God, we had the same clothes on.
[404:39.63]We had the same clothing.
[404:50.76]They had the shrine of protection?
[404:52.08]God damn it.
[405:02.68]Oh, I was going to say something.
[405:07.45]Change class?
[405:08.11]I know.
[405:08.49]I can't go out on that one.
[405:10.09]I felt really good about that fight too.
[405:17.97]Soap Andy.
[405:34.30]Goodbye.
[405:40.71]Okay, we're not doing this either.
[405:42.21]I can take one.
[405:46.43]Nope.
[405:47.17]I get killed before I open the door.
[406:14.96]Good luck.
[406:55.18]Did you do it?
[406:55.60]Oh my god!
[407:05.53]Oh no!
[407:06.07]He's gonna get killed by the fucking mage!
[407:13.61]No, no, no, no, no, no, just...
[407:41.68]You actually almost killed me.
[407:43.20]That was actually really well done.
[407:47.72]That was a lot of perseverance.
[407:49.11]Seriously.
[408:04.09]Oh shit, got a mining pick.
[408:15.73]I'm just wearing all his clothes.
[408:18.35]Wait, what if I take it and resurrect him?
[408:20.13]Oh.
[408:24.87]Jack is styled.
[408:54.47]Where are you?
[408:57.13]Where... Where is this character?
[409:06.10]I don't... I actually don't see them.
[409:08.60]Where is this... Where are they?
[409:17.22]There's no way you... There's no way you're shooting me from up there.
[409:24.99]From back there?
[409:28.10]Aiming down and in the hole?
[409:39.88]Why didn't I run?
[409:40.58]Because I wanted to go through that way.
[409:47.83]Dead and bald.
[409:54.08]Class change?
[409:54.90]Yeah, after this.
[409:57.84]Is this game good or are you just bad and make it awful?
[410:02.10]Go download it.
[410:03.48]Go download it.
[410:04.34]Go play it for 45 minutes.
[410:05.98]And then I want you to come back and report on how you did.
[410:20.32]And then play it for like another 100 hours.
[410:23.38]And realize that it's dark and darker.
[410:27.86]Doesn't matter.
[410:31.30]People will just screw you over at every turn.
[410:33.16]People will kill you.
[410:33.94]People will try to be friends with you and then backstab you.
[410:38.19]People might lock you in a room with a bunch of monsters.
[410:42.11]And then, you know, it's dark and darker.
[411:01.64]But you died by standing under an archer on purpose.
[411:08.78]See that?
[411:09.14]I thought he was done.
[411:23.84]Whatever.
[411:27.03]You have to seriously block me in here with all this.
[412:06.29]I was going to say.
[412:06.89]There's a lot of shit in here.
[412:15.95]Hold on.
[412:17.45]Now we're talking.
[412:43.68]Did I loot this already?
[412:49.83]Eh.
[412:58.05]I'm going to stay up.
[413:28.69]Oh shit.
[413:31.60]Oh, yup.
[413:56.58]Oh no.
[413:58.04]People are coming and I don't want to do well.
[414:02.74]I have to.
[414:04.10]Hold down right click.
[414:06.64]Hold down right click and left click.
[414:14.21]Okay.
[414:21.47]What is with this barrel?
[414:22.29]Hey.
[414:28.71]Huh?
[414:29.35]Hey, what's up?
[414:32.97]Do you have any healing?
[414:35.31]Let me check.
[414:40.28]Sorry, I do not.
[414:45.86]That's not so good, dude.
[414:47.10]I would have given it to you, I promise you.
[415:00.57]I'm gonna stick with you, dude.
[415:01.91]I don't know how to play the goblin cave.
[415:05.56]It's very hard.
[415:06.76]It's no joke.
[415:10.32]I've done High Roller twice, and I've lived both times, and I don't think I've lived once doing this fucking cave, so... Yeah.
[415:20.03]Just be careful.
[415:20.55]People are known to double-cross each other here, especially if they say they're a friend at first.
[415:25.20]That was a little rusty.
[415:28.14]I'm a little rusty.
[415:29.32]All right, let's move.
[415:30.90]We need light.
[415:31.88]We need light.
[415:56.13]There's so many this is like where's the spawner is it like ten of them?
[416:03.17]Yeah, we gotta get out of here I Prevent present to you Golgotha.
[416:06.26]Oh
[416:25.64]You think we can tag him?
[416:29.26]Let's do it.
[416:29.90]You think we can do it?
[416:31.12]You got good gear?
[416:31.66]Nope, but it's too late now.
[416:36.63]You can't... Okay.
[416:47.17]I'm sorry you didn't make it.
[416:48.31]I don't know if we were prepared for this.
[416:57.91]This is like a boss.
[417:02.72]All right, I got to get out of here now.
[417:07.44]I think I'm just dead.
[417:08.84]Is there another way to get out?
[417:11.97]No, I have to run.
[417:12.99]I'm stuck.
[417:17.17]What is going on?
[417:21.88]Let me fucking out of here.
[417:30.08]Where is it?
[417:31.14]Where is it?
[417:35.77]Where is it?
[417:52.88]It's up top.
[417:54.86]I'm dead.
[417:59.48]I don't know.
[417:59.92]I have no idea where it is.
[418:01.54]We're in a lot of trouble.
[418:03.66]Yeah.
[418:04.54]I don't have very much health, though.
[418:29.20]Will another one spawn in the circle?
[418:31.58]Gotta make a choice and go.
[418:33.40]I gotta make a choice here.
[418:34.46]Yeah, we gotta make a choice.
[418:35.60]I gotta make a choice.
[418:36.66]I don't know how to go up, though.
[418:38.26]I don't know where I am.
[418:39.00]I don't know where to go.
[418:40.48]Do you know how to go up?
[418:47.35]I just don't know.
[418:47.85]I don't know the layout.
[418:50.57]Like this way?
[418:52.75]Oh, we're dead.
[418:53.99]Map?
[418:54.75]I don't even know what up looks like.
[419:03.06]No, I'm dead if I go that way.
[419:06.42]I'm dead.
[419:07.72]There's nowhere to go.
[419:08.64]I wouldn't have made it.
[419:19.58]Were there any left?
[419:21.51]I think somebody got it.
[419:22.21]I just don't...
[419:28.89]The amount of levels that are in this zone, I feel like a handful of people just get screwed.
[419:34.23]Because they're just not on the right level when the shit spawns.
[419:38.87]And it's like, if I don't have health, I'll just die.
[419:50.18]Go back to the side ramp where you got to the troll.
[419:52.06]I just... Yeah.
[420:03.47]There's a guaranteed extract on here.
[420:05.31]It's represented by the stairs symbol.
[420:07.55]What?
[420:24.80]He means the stones collapsing earlier.
[420:26.60]The rock slide.
[420:27.36]It's a secret escape.
[420:29.82]Really?
[420:30.04]Really?
[420:36.32]I thought that person went in there and got crushed by the rocks.
[420:56.79]The rock slide means only one can come out.
[420:58.75]You know what it is to me?
[421:00.35]It's just kind of getting that object permanence of just where everything is on the map.
[421:06.11]It's always been hard for me to do.
[421:09.80]Because to me, all those hallways are just the same hallway in my brain.
[421:14.24]It's just the same hallway.
[421:15.32]It's just like a shredded up piece of paper.
[421:18.06]I can't even... My brain can't translate it.
[421:29.28]I think I'm dead already.
[421:35.76]Okay, bye.
[421:37.16]Bye, I guess.
[422:10.70]Light orb.
[422:12.96]I want chain lightning.
[422:15.28]Zap is kind of bad.
[422:16.14]Fireball, magic missile, lightning strike.
[422:24.86]Haste is good.
[422:26.70]Slow is... I think slow would be good too.
[422:30.02]Use it on people and run away.
[422:30.86]Try this.
[422:36.48]I really have no idea what I'm doing, but I'll try.
[422:38.04]Okay.
[423:13.03]Ouchie-wouchies.
[423:31.05]Ammo you use in the lobby is consumed.
[423:35.29]Oh, that sucks.
[423:36.77]Okay.
[423:37.19]Well, oops.
[423:37.81]Oops.
[423:42.68]That's funny.
[424:04.93]Ow.
[424:05.85]I got a thing or two to learn.
[424:09.23]Shit.
[424:09.61]That's a lot.
[424:10.22]Oh my god.
[424:10.76]That's a lot.
[424:11.34]I'm just gonna hide and leave.
[424:14.11]I'm gonna sprint to the middle right now.
[424:17.23]I'll have enough to buy another purple.
[424:28.34]Rock slide?
[424:28.88]Where is the rock slide?
[424:51.10]oh come on
[425:52.05]Fuck!
[425:52.79]Okay, it's kind of fun.
[425:54.35]It's kind of fun, but I got... I had to fight like three enemies and I fucked up and I blew myself up in the first two seconds.
[426:10.86]I was thinking, like, slow him and then maybe get him with a magic missile.
[426:13.38]I don't know.
[426:14.45]Haste always first?
[426:15.43]Okay.
[426:17.19]Can I cast it on myself?
[426:24.91]What do you got on you?
[426:30.96]Oh, nice duck.
[426:34.08]Haste, then invis.
[426:36.89]Hmm.
[426:43.55]Yeah, you can give buffs to enemies.
[426:45.07]That's true.
[426:46.21]I've actually seen it happen.
[426:49.61]You yelling a lot?
[426:54.34]Poke is a good mage.
[426:55.38]You can probably give some pointers.
[426:59.20]Maybe, yeah.
[426:59.58]What's happened to my buddy Eric?
[427:05.66]Oh, shit.
[427:07.55]Buddy Eric.
[427:19.59]Did I do it?
[427:27.63]Okay, I did it.
[428:06.41]Fuck, that's a long lead time.
[428:08.94]What is happening?
[428:14.06]Oh, they're homing missiles, kind of.
[428:21.51]Is that for me?
[428:37.63]Move speed, weapon damage.
[428:42.87]Wait, does it actually count as a staff?
[428:44.83]Can I use it as a staff?
[428:50.21]No.
[428:50.37]Okay.
[428:55.76]What's a meditate button?
[429:04.40]This is very dangerous.
[429:29.08]What?
[429:29.96]No.
[429:48.14]Fuck!
[429:56.86]I didn't know what to do.
[430:00.59]I feel like I was just dead no matter what there.
[430:13.14]Use invisibility and run?
[430:14.24]I should probably put that on.
[430:17.70]You cast haste on him?
[430:19.84]That wasn't slow?
[430:32.61]That was definitely slow.
[430:36.63]Wizard is really hard to play on the Goblin map.
[430:38.63]I feel like Wizard is probably really hard to play on any map.
[430:42.83]And you just really need to learn how to play and get good.
[430:45.85]But yes, I do agree.
[430:47.31]This is probably a bad place to try to learn how to play Wizard.
[431:03.32]If I just... Okay, so is that always on me?
[431:06.04]It is, alright.
[431:06.62]I just missed every single shot.
[431:23.47]I thought I was homing.
[432:12.73]Oh shoot.
[432:14.69]Oh.
[432:26.11]Okay.
[432:28.13]That's pretty fun.
[432:44.96]Okay, I need to meditate somewhere.
[432:46.54]I'm going to do it here.
[432:47.69]Who cares?
[432:50.93]You almost chain lightning to yourself.
[432:53.73]That can happen.
[432:54.37]That's true.
[433:08.56]Did I get everything?
[433:10.66]Kind of.
[433:10.98]Alright, what about anything over here?
[434:01.29]I need to meditate again.
[434:02.13]What's going on?
[434:13.06]Is there a way to get spells back better than this?
[434:23.16]Or you just have to do... You just have to get... Okay.
[434:26.29]That's not too bad.
[434:35.15]I think there's a portal underneath me.
[434:37.97]Saw a bunch of blue.
[434:45.32]Whatever.
[435:08.33]Don't cast that.
[435:09.27]Oh fuck.
[435:10.77]Oh no.
[435:11.67]I didn't see this.
[435:23.35]I just need to get out of here.
[435:53.78]If you get out with some gold, alchemists sell spell books.
[435:57.06]That's true.
[435:57.74]I'm going to try to get out though.
[435:58.68]I have nothing to do with this shit.
[436:15.73]Oh, this is ugly.
[436:16.69]Look at all these fucking spiders.
[436:30.57]Oh, come on, man!
[436:32.17]Oh my god, there's shit everywhere!
[436:44.90]What?
[436:45.28]Killed me!
[436:45.88]A trap on the ground, it's so stressful.
[436:50.23]I juked so many people there and the trap on the ground is pitch black.
[437:03.04]I was the last player, too.
[437:04.24]I feel like I'd rather go against groups than any of the PvE.
[437:15.62]Yeah, I feel like I just... When you run out of spells, you're kind of just in trouble.
[437:29.25]Crystal Sword is good.
[437:32.18]You can always buy one too.
[437:35.62]Drink some water.
[437:36.28]I got a big, big water right here.
[437:37.95]I'm good to go.
[438:18.45]You're gonna let one bug kill you, man.
[438:48.90]Come on, what's this?
[438:59.46]How did I end up in the same corner?
[439:00.80]How did I end up in the same corner?
[439:23.52]Oh, it's because you're red.
[439:24.56]Okay, I get it.
[439:39.60]I didn't want to do that.
[439:40.36]Sorry.
[439:54.65]Did that waste a spell?
[440:24.18]Get off that!
[440:34.17]That, I was so far away.
[440:35.37]That goes very... Ooh, don't breathe that.
[440:38.65]That goes really far.
[440:46.35]Shit, that's good.
[440:49.56]Water makes it go farther.
[440:50.74]Good to know.
[440:55.01]Very good to know.
[440:58.75]Thank you.
[440:59.23]You're in the worst possible spot you could be in.
[441:25.27]I want to just get out and make a little bit of money.
[441:30.03]Hey, I'm showing my friends at college your stream.
[441:31.73]Can you say something funny?
[441:35.83]All of you in the room right now, go do your homework.
[441:40.88]If you already did, good for you.
[441:43.50]You should eat some Cheetos.
[441:48.60]You should split a bag of Cheetos.
[441:49.90]Not one bag each of you.
[441:51.24]Split a bag of Cheetos.
[441:52.28]It's fattening shit.
[442:14.74]Hey!
[442:16.19]What was that?
[442:17.61]What, um, where did, what happened here?
[442:21.03]That was very strange.
[442:22.51]Very strange.
[442:23.73]Very strange.
[442:24.41]He went through the ceiling.
[442:29.05]What?
[442:33.57]Hold on, what happened?
[442:34.85]Was he behind the pillar?
[442:47.61]I heard footsteps, footsteps, footsteps, and then he was above you and jumped down.
[442:56.86]This is not the kind of class I can play.
[442:58.92]It's too much micromanagement.
[443:02.92]Picking up items, like going like this, and like, what spell is this?
[443:06.09]I'll do this one, and then I'll attack, and then I'll meditate.
[443:09.39]I'm literally going to be tunnel vision, someone's going to jump down and axe me in the head.
[443:21.72]Why do that when a barbarian can hit you in the head and kill you in two hits?
[443:24.26]Better for when you're in a group.
[443:39.61]I've actually seen some cracked out wizard gameplay.
[443:46.56]I watched Moon Moon play with Wizard for a little bit.
[443:50.86]And he was so unbelievably good.
[443:54.60]I thought he was hacking.
[443:58.16]It was like, he was just like... He like killed six people at one point in a row.
[444:04.88]And I was just like, holy shit.
[444:07.58]He's so good.
[444:08.66]How do you get that good?
[444:11.60]It was mind-boggling.
[444:33.99]Get this fucking shit off my screen!
[444:35.45]I can't play wizard.
[444:48.26]I actually could see how this would be, like, in a group.
[444:52.44]Yeah.
[444:54.32]I feel like standing still in this game for more than a second or two feels just... I feel naked.
[445:17.01]already dead too.
[445:17.81]Oh god.
[445:19.17]Fuck that.
[445:19.63]I want nothing to do with this.
[445:29.32]Your loot sucks.
[445:30.02]You may as well be.
[445:38.65]Hmm.
[445:49.96]Please don't kill me.
[445:50.94]Please don't kill me.
[445:51.88]Please don't.
[445:53.34]Okay.
[446:12.69]I'll try this one more time.
[446:16.69]But I need to play in a group.
[446:21.92]You can fireball the door?
[446:23.40]Oh shit, I didn't know that.
[446:41.44]Please try Rogue.
[446:43.72]I'll play Rogue next time I play, next time I stream.
[446:46.00]I'm streaming this on Friday.
[446:52.37]Friday will be Rogue Day.
[446:53.89]Let me at least try to get at least somewhat anything going with this character.
[447:24.36]I just made fucking popcorn.
[447:25.52]Anybody want some?
[447:36.73]Back to... So bad.
[447:41.98]Yeah, I gotta learn how to play with this character.
[447:45.82]I've played almost every moment of my time has been on fighter.
[447:51.55]I'm like holding right click to block.
[447:53.51]It's been like 15 hours on one character.
[448:22.30]What did you eat for breakfast?
[448:27.04]Two over easy eggs.
[448:37.51]Early game, no gear wizard.
[448:40.67]I feel like I can't engage.
[448:43.19]I have to stop engaging enemies.
[448:45.73]Only if there's like one or two.
[448:48.40]You can't just like walk around.
[448:59.72]I have to get out of these ones.
[449:00.74]They have to be really far away too.
[449:06.02]I keep walking.
[449:07.45]Oh, there's enemies.
[449:08.03]I'm going to cast my spells right here.
[449:09.41]And they're as far away as the fucking torches.
[449:11.21]They're just dead.
[449:41.85]Oh, good.
[449:48.58]Okay, anything else?
[449:54.32]I think the fire on the ground killed him.
[450:20.90]I can't believe you actually hit me.
[450:21.88]That's weird.
[450:22.28]I feel like you shouldn't have.
[450:31.71]No, don't.
[450:44.28]Quarterstaff is strong.
[450:54.92]Magic Missile seems really, really good.
[451:03.16]Oh, that was unfortunate.
[451:19.03]What the hell just happened?
[451:21.79]Is that a player?
[451:34.30]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[451:42.33]What the?
[451:42.69]Why is?
[451:43.47]What is going on?
[451:44.35]This skeleton's a barbarian?
[451:47.25]What?
[451:48.07]What's happening?
[451:49.33]He's got the skin.
[451:50.79]I thought he was a fucking NPC.
[451:52.67]What?
[451:56.42]What?
[452:02.41]I thought he was one of the skeletons in this room, and when he started just chasing me like crazy and throwing bombs, I was like, what's happening?
[452:21.41]They all have it?
[452:28.43]Damn.
[452:29.05]Okay.
[452:30.92]Oops, I didn't mean to exit the whole game.
[452:44.44]I'm going to do three more.
[452:47.76]Three more, and I'll play Rogue.
[453:14.04]Bloody mouth.
[453:19.11]Okay.
[453:19.33]How does this work?
[453:20.81]Let's find out.
[453:26.49]Block pick.
[453:30.87]The next successful attack causes the target to bleed.
[453:33.36]Because this is the bleed.
[453:34.22]And this is stealth.
[453:46.40]If you're hiding, you can move ten steps.
[454:05.67]That's right.
[454:15.02]Let's give it a go.
[454:17.96]Yeah, I'll do three more.
[454:18.92]Only three more.
[454:21.43]I don't know how to overdo it.
[454:31.05]This does not have a right click.
[454:34.81]So that's... Now if I stab, it's going to be poison.
[454:38.03]Let's try it on somebody.
[454:40.61]Okay, three more.
[454:55.17]So how do fighting NPCs PvE?
[455:02.24]Just kind of run around, dodge and stuff.
[455:06.76]That's right.
[455:13.56]Press the wrong button.
[455:22.05]That's poison.
[455:22.83]Is there anyone to tell if it's ticking?
[455:25.37]Or is it just on him?
[455:37.53]I just have to assume it's on, right?
[455:55.73]It's fun.
[456:02.41]Let me try this.
[456:04.09]So I'm... Alright, so I'm invisible right now.
[456:06.85]So I can go one... Wait, I thought I could walk.
[456:09.03]I thought I could do ten steps.
[456:17.40]Oh, it's only while crouching.
[456:18.54]Okay.
[456:18.64]Okay.
[456:30.85]Well, I'm just dead.
[456:35.69]We're... God, dude.
[456:39.16]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[456:40.40]No!
[456:41.18]No!
[456:42.78]No, yeah, listen!
[456:43.58]Listen to him!
[456:44.42]No!
[456:51.12]Help me!
[456:51.74]Help me!
[456:52.14]There's goblins everywhere!
[456:53.76]Help me!
[456:54.98]Help!
[456:57.17]Everyone in this room is going to die.
[456:59.01]Everybody in this room is going to die.
[457:00.21]I'm just saying.
[457:02.58]They're not going to make it out of this.
[457:41.11]I hit exit game again.
[457:42.43]Oh my god.
[457:43.35]I'm just getting fucking tired now.
[457:49.88]Shit.
[458:06.06]Okay.
[458:08.32]Somebody's saying I'm not doing poison.
[458:22.90]I think I am.
[458:27.28]Rupture?
[458:29.70]Oh, wait a minute.
[458:32.98]That's not poison.
[458:33.98]Wait, poisoned weapon.
[458:41.08]Hmm.
[458:42.17]Okay.
[458:46.19]So this is just a bleed.
[458:48.31]Bleed and poison stack.
[458:49.79]They stack together, I'm imagining, right?
[459:00.17]Yeah, there we go, okay.
[459:03.79]Alright, two more.
[459:21.47]Why are we resorting to violence?
[459:33.04]You gotta do three more and one comedy run.
[459:35.92]Hmm.
[459:38.70]We'll see.
[459:45.03]Itchy nose.
[459:57.57]Rogue sucks.
[460:10.88]That's a horrible room.
[460:24.63]What's up, bro?
[460:27.81]I'm friendly.
[460:28.35]Yeah, I'm friendly, bro.
[460:31.99]Excellent.
[460:35.75]Need any healing?
[460:37.59]Let me see.
[460:38.53]No, I'm good.
[460:40.79]How you doing?
[460:41.25]Alright bro.
[460:42.85]I'm chilling.
[460:43.55]Let's loot this room.
[460:45.03]There's a lot of stuff in here.
[460:46.05]Be careful though.
[460:46.53]There's demons.
[460:50.51]Huh?
[460:51.15]What the hell?
[461:20.27]My health just kind of just went to zero.
[461:22.11]I don't know what happened.
[461:23.35]I don't know.
[461:24.29]The poison killed me.
[461:27.83]The goblin spell did a U-turn.
[461:44.60]That guy is going to be talking to me because there's no possible way that I died there.
[461:50.80]He's probably still talking to me.
[461:52.86]And I've just been gone for 30 straight seconds.
[462:15.33]This game is so fun.
[462:18.38]Alright, let me get a good one.
[462:19.54]I feel like I haven't had a good one in at least five to ten attempts.
[462:24.41]It's a bunch of horse shit.
[462:48.88]Everybody stop everything we're doing.
[462:51.78]Little Caesars pretzel crust pizza is back.
[463:01.21]My jaw is hitting the floor right now.
[463:18.20]Can I actually break this?
[463:19.90]With this weapon?
[463:22.30]Or what?
[463:22.96]That's weird.
[463:28.39]No, I can't.
[463:31.21]That's annoying.
[463:50.84]Okay, I got a big problem.
[463:53.71]And it's called, I keep forgetting which is bound to what.
[464:03.64]I gotta, what, okay, it's on my thumb buttons, that's why.
[464:07.02]And they're right next to each other, and it takes me a minute to figure it out.
[464:10.13]I'm not going this way.
[464:23.07]That's so annoying.
[464:28.13]Stuck, stuck, stuck.
[464:41.97]I'm gonna step on the trap in a second, aren't I?
[465:01.24]Oh my god, do I not have that perk?
[465:03.04]Did I switch it out?
[465:03.94]I was crouched.
[465:06.02]I'm so confused.
[465:13.86]Oh, poison.
[465:14.64]Fuck.
[465:36.37]Swing!
[465:37.77]It's doing that thing again.
[465:38.61]I hear somebody.
[466:08.52]Fuck you!
[466:43.60]Barbarian?
[466:44.06]There's a barbarian somewhere right here.
[466:46.50]This is a wall, I think.
[466:52.02]Shit!
[466:54.79]I gotta put that on a different keybind.
[466:56.25]I keep almost accidentally pressing it.
[467:12.37]I need to make it like a Q or something.
[467:13.93]Because it's so hard for my brain to be like, thumb button one.
[467:17.93]And it's like, which one is that?
[467:20.68]Is that the one that's closer to me or the one that's further away?
[467:22.76]And I'm like, thumb button four.
[467:24.48]Which one is that?
[467:25.00]Is that the one that's closest to me?
[467:27.38]Thank you.
[468:03.63]Stuck again.
[468:04.27]Oh my goodness.
[468:10.45]I was like wedged in between all three of their heads.
[468:49.31]I have to leave at least a dollar.
[468:57.49]So stabbing.
[468:59.85]You have to get it.
[469:00.69]So let me just make sure I know what's happening here.
[469:03.79]Is it only that tiny little crosshair where you can actually hit?
[469:07.51]Because I feel like I'm trying to hit the blade sort of on them.
[469:13.62]It has to be directly like a little.
[469:15.56]Okay.
[469:16.34]Okay.
[469:18.60]I played Fighter for way too long.
[469:23.67]Hey, we'll get a couple bucks.
[469:25.12]That's pretty good.
[469:44.51]14.
[469:45.53]Let's go!
[469:45.97]Oh.
[469:46.03]I only have 11.
[469:48.35]Alright.
[470:01.31]Last one.
[470:03.44]This is the last one.
[470:10.52]Yep.
[470:10.72]The demo's on the Steam...
[470:13.58]playtest demo thing until the 13th.
[470:17.87]If you want to play it, you've got three and a half days, three days or so.
[470:47.99]No thanks.
[471:22.79]Alright, fighting people on stairs is just not fun.
[471:49.60]Well, that's better.
[472:01.91]Does the rogue get some kind of self-heal eventually or no?
[472:14.50]Nope.
[472:23.39]Somebody coming?
[472:24.29]You gonna come down this hall?
[472:47.21]They weren't aggroed before.
[472:48.57]What?
[472:52.51]I walked further away, not closer.
[472:54.07]This sucks.
[473:10.27]Out of the fryer, and into the fryer later, as they say.
[473:13.62]Out of the fryer later, and into the frying pan.
[473:30.37]If you had a heal, I would be so happy.
[473:37.51]Oh my goodness, that's so good.
[473:39.40]You saved my life.
[473:40.52]Here.
[473:40.70]I got you, bro.
[473:44.25]As long as you don't, you know, like, stab me in the back or something.
[473:49.25]Thanks, bro.
[474:12.46]Eh, we're friendly.
[474:13.34]We're friendly.
[474:27.41]Need all the friends we can get in this... dump.
[474:51.76]Either one of you need healing at all.
[474:53.06]Can I have another one?
[474:55.50]I don't want to be greedy.
[474:58.90]That's all good.
[474:59.56]Thank you.
[475:09.02]Go.
[475:18.12]Yeah, let's go!
[475:18.80]Let's go!
[475:19.70]We could also play Duck Duck Goose to see who has to get killed.
[475:22.22]For the guild!
[476:19.32]I've never seen this thing die before.
[476:20.54]What do you have on him?
[476:24.04]Sanctuary.
[476:24.76]Come here.
[476:25.70]Purple mace for the cleric.
[476:29.76]Oh, that's pretty sweet.
[476:33.73]Oh, hell yeah.
[476:42.13]Thanks, bro.
[476:56.38]Some really nice people.
[476:57.46]Alright.
[477:01.08]Cleric, you take it since you just got a purple thing.
[477:03.40]Yeah, get out of here, man.
[477:04.44]Take the thing and stash it.
[477:06.56]Does anyone need any extra healing at all before I go?
[477:09.19]Give these a little extra.
[477:12.23]Alright, I got you.
[477:12.69]Hold on.
[477:15.61]Hot.
[477:17.63]What?
[477:17.87]Just lied.
[477:21.95]Oh my goodness.
[477:23.35]And right when we talked about friends and friendship and companionship... I thought you just hit me and I was about to cry.
[477:34.89]Did he die?
[477:38.67]No.
[477:42.29]Okay, I thought he died.
[477:52.84]Guys, I already killed the troll.
[477:55.27]You did?
[477:55.65]Oh, good stuff.
[477:57.55]He looks dead.
[478:03.91]Any scraps?
[478:14.32]Since you got the purple, you should take it.
[478:15.96]And then he just walks in it.
[478:17.18]I don't know which side it was.
[478:19.18]Anyway, it doesn't matter.
[478:22.18]We gotta find you a portal.
[478:25.48]Just be chill, guys.
[478:27.92]I'm gonna open this up.
[478:29.26]The cleric's gotta take this.
[478:31.12]We're all gonna pick numbers between 10, alright?
[478:32.74]Okay, that works.
[478:35.37]We're gonna do this democratically.
[478:37.39]Bro, just fucking run in.
[478:38.67]No, no, no!
[478:40.93]I'm just kidding.
[478:43.65]You got it.
[478:46.19]Oh.
[478:46.91]Unfortunate.
[478:51.19]Whoa, chill, chill, chill.
[478:54.59]We're all fucked here anyways.
[478:58.18]How do we get you out of here with that purple?
[479:02.12]I should probably stop saying that out loud, by the way.
[479:04.74]Come here.
[479:10.71]It's like I'm trying to get him killed.
[479:13.15]You need to get out of here at that point.
[479:15.86]I'm trying to be like... What?
[479:17.42]Was that him?
[479:19.60]Where is it?
[479:33.12]Where is it?
[479:33.56]I need to give it back to him.
[479:34.82]How did he die?
[479:36.24]What if this is not it?
[479:37.28]Somebody took it.
[479:38.50]Who took that mace?
[479:39.48]Who took that mace?
[479:40.10]I need to know.
[479:42.28]What mace?
[479:43.02]Who took the mace?
[479:45.16]I don't have a mace.
[480:00.46]No, I tried.
[480:03.76]I had to get revenge.
[480:06.50]That was so sad.
[480:08.58]That was so sad.
[480:13.96]I'm sitting there talking to him and I turn around and he's dead.
[480:20.13]What killed him?
[480:25.88]That guy was so nice, too.
[480:27.62]He was hailing.
[480:28.40]Hey, anybody else need to be topped off?
[480:31.35]Oh, yeah, sure, man.
[480:32.59]I do.
[480:33.53]Oh, yeah, here.
[480:37.15]No good deed.
[480:37.85]It was unfunished.
[480:40.37]Unfortunately.
[480:52.53]Hey, I was trying to tell him to just run in.
[480:55.71]Can't trust anybody.
[480:57.47]You really can't?
[481:09.53]Yeah, a shitload of subs came in.
[481:11.09]Oh my god.
[481:11.65]I don't really shout subs out.
[481:14.55]I don't shout subs or bits or donations or anything like that out, but Jesus.
[481:18.33]Jesus.
[481:21.81]It's completely unnecessary, but I appreciate it.
[481:24.89]Thank you.
[481:38.42]Oh boy, I'm already dead here.
[481:39.98]Not if I go invisible.
[481:41.24]Whatever.
[481:46.62]That one doesn't count?
[481:47.22]No, it doesn't.
[481:47.86]Let me play one more with the character I know how to play.
[481:53.70]This game is so addicting.
[481:54.64]There's something about it.
[481:55.32]Oh, we're getting the comedy run.
[482:13.74]Oh, I think that one was a comedy run.
[482:27.48]Last one, Larry?
[482:28.36]Yeah.
[482:35.49]Can't trust anybody.
[482:39.73]Oh, man.
[482:41.11]It's cool purple, too.
[482:42.35]And it's like, wow, cool purple.
[482:46.65]This is always a bad start.
[482:57.69]Swing!
[482:58.73]Swing!
[483:00.87]Sometimes, man, this game.
[483:05.50]Ran away.
[483:30.91]I feel the most safe with fighter.
[483:32.53]I know it's a default class, but still.
[483:37.62]Are they actually going to put a bard in?
[483:38.84]That'd be fun actually.
[483:40.82]What?
[483:56.81]They use it now, unfortunately.
[484:16.56]Was the pretzel cross pizza thing actually back, or was that person just saying that and now just severely pissed me off?
[484:41.76]Got your back.
[484:45.22]Oh, that's good.
[485:09.02]Good.
[485:12.73]We could get that middle group.
[485:17.15]Actually, I gotta leave.
[485:22.05]Coming soon.
[485:28.91]Wanna go for the middle group?
[485:31.75]You think we can take them?
[485:32.39]I think so.
[485:43.02]Oh my god, that hurt a lot.
[485:48.16]I'm so slow.
[485:49.22]Oh my god, that's doing so much damage to me.
[486:00.22]We gotta loot and get out of here.
[486:01.30]Mmm...
[486:28.03]We gotta go.
[486:28.43]Um... I'm gonna use the campfire.
[486:48.38]Let's go in a safe place and use the... Um...
[487:02.17]I know where else really to do this and I need it right now.
[487:05.37]We're in the circle.
[487:28.87]Yep.
[487:32.11]yep oh shit portal somewhere around here
[488:05.47]Shit went down over here.
[488:33.02]The portal.
[488:37.30]This is dangerous down here.
[488:38.24]I don't think we want to go down here.
[488:39.70]Yeah, that's just certain death.
[488:57.61]Friendly.
[489:03.58]I'm not one of those backstabbers.
[489:06.14]Oops.
[489:16.33]Oh no.
[489:33.18]Ah!
[489:33.98]Shit!
[489:34.42]I almost did it too.
[489:35.00]Can I have another one of those heals?
[490:07.65]Hey, come take this, uh, this cabinet.
[490:14.79]You got any more of those heals on you?
[490:25.38]Oh, no.
[490:26.10]I, I, we, uh, we gotta fight for this.
[490:28.38]We have to fight for this.
[490:30.70]I'm sorry.
[490:31.28]We have to fight for this.
[490:34.00]Don't we?
[490:37.86]Alright, good luck.
[490:48.30]I'm out.
[490:48.70]I was willing to do a duel for it.
[490:50.25]You know what I mean?
[490:55.27]It's like, I want to go, you want to go.
[490:56.77]I mean, we could have fought to death for it, I think.
[490:59.51]And that, I think that's a fair way to do it.
[491:18.91]A cleric can live a pretty long time in the dust.
[491:26.90]Is there still a portal?
[491:30.64]Oh, there's one right there!
[491:31.80]You got it!
[491:32.80]You got it!
[491:33.94]You got it!
[491:38.32]It's so close!
[491:39.91]Please!
[491:40.41]No!
[491:44.41]Oh, yes.
[491:45.07]All right.
[491:45.41]Good.
[491:45.91]All right.
[491:46.31]We're good.
[491:47.85]Damn.
[491:48.47]Just barely.
[491:48.93]I want to make sure you made it out alive.
[491:58.49]That's a lot of stuff.
[492:01.97]Let's get rid of it.
[492:09.87]Damn.
[492:11.85]Damn.
[492:12.13]Damn.
[492:22.46]85 gold.
[492:23.26]Nice.
[492:36.14]I'll keep the boots.
[492:59.17]I'm going to start collecting kind of middle of the road shitty gear.
[493:02.85]I feel like I just dump everything.
[493:12.84]What's that in the corner?
[493:17.08]It's been like a weird bug.
[493:18.32]I can't like scroll over it.
[493:21.61]Weird.
[493:22.25]That means a little force field or something.
[493:29.85]Alright, last one.
[493:35.64]Final one.
[493:36.08]This is truly the final one.
[493:44.15]It's like 2am and I gotta eat some more food.
[493:46.11]Oh well.
[493:48.65]This game really is really fun though.
[493:50.05]Even though I'm not very good at it.
[493:51.77]There's something about it.
[493:55.03]The treachery.
[493:55.73]The companionship.
[493:58.77]There's so much... You know what?
[493:59.69]It feels like there's so much heartbreak.
[494:03.62]It feels like every two or three rounds, there's a story that's been told.
[494:07.50]It's cool.
[494:10.48]I like it.
[494:18.49]It reminds me of the way people acted in the TF2 days.
[494:26.10]Just that goofy shit that was constantly happening.
[494:30.16]People just randomly RPing for no reason.
[494:33.28]People walking into traps and dying.
[494:35.92]The sandwich heavy shit.
[494:37.35]It just reminds me of those old days of... You kind of never know what's going to happen.
[494:43.55]Which means it's worth playing over and over again.
[494:49.83]And I'll be honest, if anything can scratch that itch again, I'm going to play it.
[494:53.95]And that's what's happening.
[494:58.65]It's like the guy running in to try to fight the troll.
[495:00.77]Oh, hey, yeah, let's fight it.
[495:02.47]And he dies in one hit.
[495:03.64]That person told a whole story in two minutes.
[495:08.67]It was hilarious.
[495:21.82]You're gonna hate this game in a week.
[495:24.04]Um, well, I won't be able to because it's not gonna be playable in a week, so... Getting just enough.
[495:37.69]No, no, no, no, nope, nope, nope.
[495:43.84]We gotta fight.
[496:00.68]How are you still alive, man?
[496:02.50]Come on, dude.
[496:09.66]Archer is still right here.
[496:17.21]There's two archers.
[496:19.51]This is bad.
[496:35.95]I'm so tilted by that that I'm like... Two archers.
[496:49.58]You may as well just leave the room.
[496:51.48]Because your opportunity to attack is just gone completely.
[496:55.59]That didn't count.
[497:27.37]This is actually the last one, because I'm starting to get, like, foggy.
[497:39.61]This is not the type of game you play when you're, like, foggy tired.
[497:42.62]Oh, this is exactly when I wanted to play and how long I wanted to play.
[497:48.54]Yeah, this is it.
[497:49.16]Let's do it.
[497:51.12]Definitely not bringing this Weander out.
[497:52.66]No way.
[498:02.13]Oh yeah, foggy.
[498:03.87]Foggy.
[498:04.31]I'm looking through a fucking foggy window right now.
[498:43.53]Don't get overwhelmed.
[498:44.27]They're going to be spawning over and over again, but they're not red.
[498:47.02]We're good.
[499:00.07]Okay.
[499:04.89]Coins?
[499:10.63]I would like to get out of here with a bunch of stuff.
[499:13.21]Oh.
[499:14.15]That's... That's good.
[499:23.88]Very, very nice.
[499:47.62]Mm-hmm.
[499:49.34]What on earth are you doing?
[500:08.29]Stop doing that.
[500:08.81]Why is it doing that?
[500:16.41]Cool.
[500:22.66]Let's go!
[500:23.34]Good morning?
[500:38.07]Good morning!
[500:38.81]How are you?
[500:54.57]Who is your daddy?
[500:56.51]And what does he do?
[501:16.18]Fuck you.
[501:29.89]Better not be a mimic.
[501:30.55]I want to ask you a bunch of questions.
[501:39.62]And I want to have them answered immediately.
[501:44.48]Who is your daddy?
[501:46.46]What does he do?
[501:54.13]Well I hope you leave her the proof of her fist because I'm going to ram it into your stomach!
[502:12.23]Goodbye.
[502:21.88]I heard a portal, and I would love to find it.
[502:28.00]Was that behind me, or... This is the place to be to look.
[502:43.72]He missed and hit me.
[502:47.43]Shit.
[502:59.00]You fucking around?
[503:01.32]Oh, you are fucking around, aren't you?
[503:06.60]Oh, shit.
[503:06.96]Portal down there.
[503:07.46]Fuck.
[503:07.92]I don't care anymore about fighting anybody.
[503:09.51]Portal down.
[503:19.91]I don't want to fight you.
[503:21.85]I don't want to fight you.
[503:22.71]You're shooting arrows at me though.
[503:52.42]Where is it?
[504:15.07]What the fuck?
[504:15.79]Was somebody behind me?
[504:21.13]There was a fucking guy behind me, wasn't there?
[504:23.39]I would have had that too.
[504:27.51]Fuck!
[504:29.43]Ugh!
[504:37.19]Goblin was hitting me from behind.
[504:46.02]How much damage... Did you take more damage from behind?
[504:53.90]I feel like I could have gotten out of that too.
[504:56.41]I tried to jump around, but I bumped into the fucking lamppost and everything is just collision in this game.
[505:01.62]So I just fell straight down.
[505:54.84]I don't want to use it.
[506:32.04]Did that hurt somebody?
[507:04.39]He's behind me right now.
[507:05.83]Okay, I got some pretty good stuff.
[507:07.07]I gotta actually hunker down here.
[507:08.47]Why you both have the same animation right now?
[507:38.27]You became an EU streamer.
[507:41.02]Yeah, technically, right?
[507:54.20]No bullshit here.
[508:07.81]That's the secret escape tunnel.
[508:08.75]Are you gonna shoot?
[508:44.19]They're scared of me.
[508:52.75]I want to loot this room so bad, but that's not happening.
[508:58.60]I guess maybe I could.
[509:03.04]Oh, you little shit!
[509:04.46]Just die!
[509:23.08]How many hits is this guy going to take?
[509:25.04]I've hit him five times.
[509:29.48]Oh, would you just fuck off already?
[509:41.93]Whatever.
[509:46.10]I heard it.
[509:46.74]Where was it?
[509:48.86]I heard it.
[509:49.34]I don't know where it is, though.
[509:53.99]You know what, you little fuckface?
[509:57.45]I'm gonna enjoy this!
[510:15.14]So much good stuff, so much good stuff, so much good stuff, so much good stuff.
[510:19.58]Go to the tunnel now?
[510:20.72]Hold on.
[510:27.52]How do I go through the tunnel?
[510:33.91]Is it just open?
[510:35.51]Wait, I can just leave?
[510:36.51]Did I win?
[510:50.85]Holy shit.
[510:52.07]Yeah!
[511:07.13]Worth a lot.
[511:11.31]Oh my goodness.
[511:14.00]Yep.
[511:26.25]Hmm.
[511:27.85]No, I'll keep these.
[511:36.94]Why do I have this?
[511:37.56]All right.
[511:58.73]One more.
[512:03.85]I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to...
[512:28.46]Dark.
[512:30.88]And darker.
[512:36.11]Tell me if this sounds funny.
[512:47.60]Dark.
[512:49.62]And darker.
[512:56.69]Yeah.
[513:00.12]If I kill somebody, I have to say that.
[513:16.03]I want to be able to see you.
[513:27.07]Do it when you die.
[513:28.17]Yeah, okay.
[513:39.92]Was it supposed to be a voice filter?
[513:42.00]Yes, there is.
[513:44.13]Can you not hear anything?
[513:51.81]There's none.
[513:53.51]Yeah, you can.
[514:02.90]You guys are messing with me, right?
[514:09.81]It's too subtle.
[514:14.60]How about this?
[514:16.74]Is this subtle enough for you?
[514:22.34]Better?
[514:23.95]Okay.
[514:53.68]Don't run.
[514:57.28]You've ruined everything, because now I can't open the chests.
[515:16.08]This is very bad, too.
[515:17.66]I'm going down.
[515:18.92]Fuck it.
[515:23.44]Not putting up with... There's a bug behind me.
[515:25.94]Worst bugs in the game.
[515:28.01]I hate those things so much.
[515:36.99]Doc.
[515:38.33]And Doc.
[515:41.25]Oh, shit, bro.
[515:42.01]What have you done?
[515:43.41]What did you bring in here?
[515:44.49]Oh.
[515:46.21]Oh, my God.
[515:48.04]Oh, my God.
[515:50.32]Oh, my God.
[516:02.12]Alright, I'm going to bed.
[516:03.02]I'm outta here.
[516:21.83]I can't end on that one.
[516:40.36]I wonder what that must have looked like on their screen.
[517:01.66]So many things were behind them.
[517:12.49]Help, please.
[517:50.66]this up a lot.
[517:57.94]You made it through my entire work night.
[518:01.75]Yeah, I mean, well, it's not going to be around.
[518:04.91]And I know if I don't get my fill of this, I'm going to be disappointed that I didn't
[518:34.69]Shit going down over there.
[518:35.74]How did that hit me?
[518:39.52]Swing, please!
[518:40.28]I don't have time to bug out.
[519:17.14]You kill one, two more spawn.
[519:34.50]Very nice.
[519:47.83]of a podcast.
[520:19.55]Come on.
[520:22.45]Double lantern.
[520:23.77]Hog.
[520:32.70]Let's freak that person out.
[521:10.27]Come on.
[521:10.83]Go ahead.
[521:19.63]Nice.
[521:20.99]Oh my goodness.
[521:21.65]I didn't even realize what was happening.
[521:25.07]I'm taking my sweet ass time here.
[521:26.69]I don't care.
[521:27.99]I want him.
[521:28.95]I'm looting it.
[522:07.72]Fuck you.
[522:17.89]Where is it?
[522:18.27]Fucking just heard it.
[523:04.01]Oh my god.
[523:04.83]Why do you have more health than these assholes?
[523:06.97]Gotta go.
[523:17.35]Pick it up.
[523:34.56]I wasn't trying to sneak up on you.
[523:35.56]I was trying to go around you because I thought you were going to try to kill me.
[523:37.62]So I tried to avoid you.
[524:05.96]Where is this?
[524:06.58]I need a portal right now.
[524:25.09]These red spiders, they're going to screw everything up for us.
[524:36.80]Of course, why are they aggro to me the whole time?
[524:40.62]They're aggro to me.
[524:42.30]He's standing still.
[524:44.32]Why are they just running in a circle around me?
[524:46.84]Why did they not attack him?
[524:49.52]What the fuck?
[524:57.65]Where is it?
[525:05.51]Where is it?
[525:06.15]Is it not up right?
[525:09.33]I heard it.
[525:11.99]It's up or down a floor.
[525:13.67]Oh, I hate this shit.
[525:16.94]Because by the time that this stuff spawns, you're fucking in the red.
[525:21.76]And you've got to... And everyone's beat up.
[525:23.78]Everyone's have... I thought there was another person.
[525:26.60]What?
[525:32.54]Go down?
[525:32.96]I honestly just don't even know how to go down.
[525:38.44]I'm gonna go... I heard another one.
[525:46.48]No, I thought it was over here.
[525:51.52]Stay here?
[525:56.21]Should I... I mean...
[525:59.33]I hate that it spawns below you in the fucking red circles already here.
[526:02.95]They've all already spawned.
[526:04.39]Oh my god.
[526:13.71]Yeah, like, good luck finding it.
[526:26.92]The fact that there's three levels here...
[526:30.09]at the very end, when there's nowhere to go, if one spawns above or below, it just, it just fucks you.
[526:40.00]Too many layers.
[526:41.42]Too many layers.
[526:41.98]Mm-mm-mm-mm.
[527:00.75]I was gonna win that one too.
[527:02.25]You know what?
[527:02.63]Nope.
[527:02.87]I'm not being nice anymore.
[527:05.35]I'm just killing anyone I come across.
[527:10.89]To be fair though, I wasn't being nice.
[527:12.19]I was genuinely afraid of that guy.
[527:14.43]It's different.
[527:18.91]Running around in circles with these two spiders.
[527:21.11]And this guy's just like... Nothing even attacks him.
[527:27.23]I'm running around.
[527:27.71]I got these spiders chasing my ass.
[527:37.52]Like I wrote a whole book report.
[527:54.13]Nope.
[527:55.33]That's not happening.
[528:26.13]That actually scared the shit out of me.
[528:27.90]My whole body hurts.
[528:29.04]I thought that was a player.
[528:29.82]Oh my goodness.
[528:35.54]Please.
[528:42.47]Did I even aggro this many monsters?
[528:45.15]When did that happen?
[528:48.19]Oh, it's over.
[528:49.33]Oh, come on.
[528:50.27]I can't go out on that.
[528:51.31]That sucked.
[528:57.64]God damn it.
[529:00.56]I mean, maybe if I just keep walking them around.
[529:04.81]Where are they all coming from?
[529:07.69]The whole fucking floor is aggroed to me.
[529:11.44]What the hell?
[529:37.08]Alright, no matter what, this is the last one.
[529:38.21]This is it.
[529:42.05]This is the last one.
[529:47.17]If this is not the last game, because I need to go to bed.
[529:50.53]If this is not the last game, then I will eat a pair of shoes on camera.
[529:56.79]last game for tonight the last game for tonight I'm gonna play again probably on friday I mean just for this period right now this stream right now I will eat a pair of shoes on camera if this is not the last one because I gotta go to bed but I love this game it's fun don't worry I'll be fine don't worry about me worry about yourself how are you doing you okay things going all right
[530:59.63]Game lagged.
[531:01.43]You saw what happened.
[531:04.27]There's an elderly man in Las Vegas.
[531:15.74]We won't go to bed.
[531:20.95]Final attack.
[531:26.39]I didn't even want to aggro these, and now I have to fight him.
[531:34.32]Alright, please just leave me alone.
[531:35.38]I'm just gonna close the door, whatever.
[531:59.10]He was just acting weird.
[532:00.54]He was just acting weird.
[532:13.51]What?
[532:13.87]Oh.
[532:20.97]Well, come on then.
[532:21.75]If you're going to come down here, then come over here.
[532:42.23]You gotta be kidding me.
[532:45.04]Oh my goodness.
[532:45.88]This is bad.
[532:48.01]This is very bad.
[533:12.42]Stupid!
[533:13.70]You're stupid!
[533:14.74]You're stupid!
[533:15.64]Do I just eat the pair of shoes and not even care?
[533:41.10]Shit.
[533:43.98]All right.
[533:44.48]All right.
[533:44.80]All right.
[533:45.08]I'm out.
[533:45.34]I'm out.
[533:45.54]I'll see you later.
[533:51.58]It's fun.
[533:52.24]It's fun.
[533:52.84]It's fun.
[533:57.27]It's fun.
[533:58.67]I still think this is too hard, though.
[534:07.62]I love it.
[534:13.17]No fondant for you.
[534:14.41]I want to do this.
[534:23.93]This is so stressful, but I want to do it.
[534:31.93]Part of me feels like you gear up here and you take your gear here.
[534:35.59]But I almost feel like I could play here without being able to be geared.
[534:43.13]Feels like you need to be kind of geared for this.
[534:44.36]No one's sleeping, you're still streaming.
[535:02.54]Show stash?
[535:05.71]Right, let me make some people very happy, right?
[535:08.03]No, no, no, no.
[535:13.05]I like my stray gold coins.
[535:23.86]One more?
[535:24.36]No, I just said I was going to eat a pair of shoes if I did one more.
[535:27.23]And yeah, I'm very tired.
[537:14.10]Ow, my elbow.
[538:04.49]you oh just so anytime I open my stash people just like whoa dude what is going on with you
[538:40.08]I'm going to bed.
[538:40.78]I'll see you later.
[538:41.70]I'm going to bed.
[538:42.28]I was going to write a huge U. Well, now I got to fix it.
[538:52.99]Let me fix it.
[538:55.13]Is there an auto-correct?
[538:56.19]Like an auto-stash button?
[539:00.80]Quitter.
[539:02.30]Alright, I'll see you later.
[539:04.76]Yeah, I'm out.
[539:05.74]Take care.
[539:09.14]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[539:14.11]See you guys on Friday.
[539:14.77]For more... Darker.
[539:20.84]And darker.
[539:29.14]And then... I think what's... Probably on Saturday or Sunday.
[539:32.67]Unless... I don't know.
[539:36.75]Stir and I were planning on doing some Elden Ring.
[539:39.61]But... You know.
[539:43.19]Who knows?
[539:53.44]It'll be dark and darker again.
[539:56.14]Stir's going to be very upset if he hears that.
[539:57.96]Don't tell him that.
[540:01.77]Hey dude, Jermyn was talking about how he wanted to maybe play dark and darker instead on like Sunday.
[540:08.57]Don't tell him that.
[540:18.69]No, we probably... All jokes aside, we probably will do Elden Ring.
[540:22.09]I don't know.
[540:22.71]Maybe Stir gets into it.
[540:24.17]We'll see.
[540:24.95]Everything's all up in the air.
[540:25.71]Everything's good.
[540:28.08]But that's going to be it.
[540:29.08]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[540:30.62]See you guys on Friday.
[540:32.06]Starting kind of probably around... Maybe a little bit earlier, depending.
[540:36.30]But probably around the same time.
[540:39.64]Kind of a night streamer now.
[540:41.62]I really like it.
[540:43.16]I like this schedule.
[540:46.08]I know a lot of people are not going to be happy to hear that, but it's the truth.
[540:52.98]But yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[540:56.68]Friday, going to try to cycle in some other people.
[541:00.10]I know Italics mentioned he kind of wanted to play it.
[541:02.45]Just kind of pinging people to see.
[541:07.21]Me and Will Neff were talking about it too.
[541:09.69]Try to find the right opportunity to play maybe.
[541:15.09]He's very good people, so... Also, if Poke wants to play, I would play with Poke.
[541:21.98]And a lot of people are playing this right now, so... Obviously, I want to try to jump around and play with as many people as I can while it's live.
[541:48.23]yeah it's gonna be a lot of credits oh oh my god yeah all the all the subs from uh ashley yeah I I don't if those of you that don't know I don't shout out subs anymore I really appreciate anybody that subs to this channel but
[542:12.83]There are a lot of people on Twitch, on YouTube, whatever, that I think your sub would probably be better used on them.
[542:24.80]I do appreciate the support.
[542:25.80]I know it's crazy to see that kind of support, but there's definitely a lot of people on this platform that you should be giving that to.
[542:36.08]But I appreciate it.
[542:45.07]People are already in Poke's chat telling him you want to play, lol.
[542:49.93]That's how the streamers communicate, you know?
[542:54.03]Streamer 1 says, oh yeah, that would be fun.
[542:56.43]And then streamer 1's chat goes to streamer 2's chat immediately, saying, let's go!
[543:02.36]That's how it works.
[543:08.06]Yeah, we communicate through proxy, that's true.
[543:16.55]This game sucks.
[543:17.31]Play Steve Jackson's Sorcery, the greatest game ever made in the history of mankind.
[543:22.85]This game definitely does not suck.
[543:40.56]Please finish Sorcery.
[543:42.53]Yeah, I know.
[543:43.43]Once some of this new stuff dies down, there'll be a lot of stuff to just jump into.
[543:47.35]When was the last time you felt this way about a game?
[543:57.13]Maybe Fistful of Frags?
[544:04.80]Elden Ring?
[544:06.64]Bloodborne?
[544:07.16]I mean, if you're talking about multiplayer games, then Fistful of Frags is probably the last one.
[544:17.68]I think Fistful of Frags is one of the best FPSs to ever be made.
[544:21.43]That game was so unbelievably fun.
[544:26.31]I've said that on camera before.
[544:27.61]That's one of the best FPSs.
[544:46.83]Playing Fistful of Frags, when you got that 007 GoldenEye golden gun, the thing that killed people in one shot, but it was super slow.
[544:58.00]It was ba-boom, ba-boom.
[545:01.41]I loved that weapon.
[545:04.37]You found it, it had six bullets in it.
[545:06.49]Walker, yep.
[545:07.99]Maybe we'll play that too at some point.
[545:11.82]That game is so good.
[545:18.92]Don't worry, I'm going to send more to smaller streamers.
[545:20.86]Oh, hell yeah.
[545:22.28]Good to know.
[545:26.76]Also, take care of yourself too, though.
[545:27.92]I don't know what your financial situation looks like, and I'm not going to pretend to, but... Take care of yourself too.
[545:36.07]That's important.
[545:44.55]They added horses?
[545:48.50]Ones you can ride?
[545:49.22]Yeah.
[545:58.19]I'll see you guys Friday.
[545:59.05]Friday evening.
[546:05.08]Thanks to, obviously, to Vinny, Stir, Caleb, um,
[546:12.54]I'm going to try to jump in a game with Kryken, too.
[546:14.72]Kryken and the group he was playing with.
[546:17.33]We had a DM group where we were just kind of like, oh, who's around?
[546:20.37]And we kind of filled out, and we had two different separate groups going, so... Try to get a few games to Kryken as well this Friday.
[546:30.04]But yeah, take care of yourselves.
[546:31.04]Good night.
[546:32.32]Get some water.
[546:33.00]Get some sleep.
[546:33.64]Or good morning.
[546:36.00]See you soon.
[546:44.07]Have a great night.
[546:46.39]Or enjoy your breakfast.
[546:52.92]See you later.
[547:32.90]you
[548:07.78]you
[548:41.63]Thank you.
