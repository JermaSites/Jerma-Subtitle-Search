[00:00.03]Testing, Mike, Shuffler, you catching us?
[00:02.76]Hello.
[00:05.00]I thought fail boat was this thing.
[00:06.16]It actually worked, it actually worked.
[00:08.66]Okay, cool.
[00:09.84]Shuffler, can you talk a little bit about your AI?
[00:11.93]What is powering everything that's going on here?
[00:16.55]Yeah.
[00:17.93]Okay, math should be working at this point.
[00:20.26]Can you give us?
[00:20.82]I, lovely.
[00:22.56]I, lovely.
[00:23.98]Oh, okay.
[00:25.04]It's got self-esteem.
[00:26.00]6,241 divided by 133.5.
[00:26.88]6, 9, 4, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3.
[00:39.26]There we go.
[00:41.24]No, that's so wrong.
[00:42.56]They said eight numbers in a row, and we all applauded.
[00:48.33]Stan?
[00:49.41]Yes?
[00:51.45]I love you.
[00:56.93]How do you feel about Ludwig, though?
[00:58.43]Processing.
[00:59.19]I hate Ludwig.
[01:06.27]Oh, he's working great.
[01:08.27]We just wrapped up Tetris, Shuffler.
[01:10.05]What do we got next?
[01:11.35]Yeah.
[01:12.87]Supermodel 64.
[01:15.02]No, not quite.
[01:18.22]So that's later.
[01:18.80]That'll be the second set.
[01:23.06]Give us your best host line.
[01:24.32]Sure, yeah.
[01:24.86]Ludwig, fuck you.
[01:30.38]And we're going to use this 10 points for Team Orange.
[01:33.46]Oh, that is completely wrong.
[01:36.17]Does that work?
[01:37.69]No.
[01:38.39]We are jumping into Super Mario World blindfolded.
[01:41.25]Two players.
[01:42.31]Super Mario 64.
[01:46.18]Switch.
[01:47.32]Switch?
[01:47.90]Yes, sir.

[01:56.03]Inside me.
[01:57.63]Wow.
[01:57.97]That's the most romantic thing that's happened to me in a long time.
[02:04.17]Blue team, both of you are heading over there and you are versus orange team with Squeaks and Ludwig.
[02:08.90]Go get into the position.
[02:12.78]Uh, hold on.

[03:27.38]I'm sorry, what?
[03:29.14]That is not allowed.
[03:30.20]Which one of you told the shuffler about porn?
[03:33.02]Sorry.
[03:33.32]Oh, okay.
[03:34.41]Several of you have been... Okay.
[03:37.67]Is porn copyright free?
[03:39.29]Yeah.
[03:39.99]Okay.
[03:41.11]Oh, yeah.
[03:44.47]What is dentist?
[03:47.96]Do you know what teeth are?
[03:50.22]I don't know if that was in the training data.
[03:52.10]No.
[03:53.75]That's a hard start.
[03:54.55]It's hard to explain.
[03:55.25]It's bones.
[03:57.13]Explain.
[03:58.03]It's where you get your wires cleaned.
[04:00.13]It's like debugging.
[04:01.29]Yeah.
[04:01.67]For your mouth.
[04:02.54]Yeah.
[04:03.26]You got a mouth.
[04:04.36]Oh, sorry.
[04:05.56]No.
[04:06.24]Shuffler.
[04:06.88]Shuffler.

[04:08.72]It is my birthday.
[04:12.20]Happy birthday.
[04:15.40]Happy birthday to you.
[04:18.16]Shuffler, how old are you turning?
[04:24.21]Shuffler, do you know what the penis is?
[04:25.49]I do.
[04:25.71]Okay, alright.
[04:27.01]I do.
[04:27.29]Yes, I do.
[04:27.61]Penis is... It's what?
[04:29.19]Do you think I am stupid?
[04:30.53]You didn't know what teeth were.
[04:31.39]Learn passive aggression before the dentist.
[04:50.04]I installed the penis module before the teeth module.
[04:52.56]That's fair.
[04:53.32]We only had so much time.
[04:54.38]Order of operations.
[04:55.12]You have to install the penis module with your teeth.
[04:57.32]Penis module.
[04:58.54]Penis module.
[05:01.28]Grabbing penis module.
[05:03.20]No, do not.

[10:11.05]Can somebody help out over here?
[10:13.04]You got a problem with weed?
[10:14.90]Stans, Failboat, maybe, can you help?
[10:18.42]Shuffler, we are going to deactivate your smoking module.
[10:21.22]Don't deactivate my fucking smoking module.
[10:23.10]Do not.
[10:23.60]We're going to take out the drunk module.
[10:25.66]This is a real piece of, like, nightmare blood rotation.
[10:27.58]Try the lower ones, because they'll pipe in through.
[10:29.60]Little bro, little bro takes away my fucking movie module.
[10:32.85]Alright, alright.
[10:35.23]We are going to deactivate the drunk module.
[10:37.33]Why don't you go ahead and pull... No, pull the lower ones.
[10:39.23]Try the lower, I think.
[10:40.75]Nah, nah, don't pull that.

[10:42.57]Try pulling that one.
[10:43.55]Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[10:44.57]Don't, don't, don't pull that one.
[10:45.83]Try that.
[10:46.01]Don't pull that one.
[10:50.92]Does anyone want to watch a Disney movie?
[10:53.24]Carbon monoxide detector going off.
[10:57.66]Shuffler, what do you think about getting into our next bonus round?
[11:06.86]This was a triumph.
[11:14.57]Shuffler, what's your favorite movie ever?
[11:16.63]Because I love movies too.
[11:18.63]Ooh.
[11:19.11]Wow.
[11:19.51]A little bit of pandering.
[11:23.22]So many movies?
[11:25.70]So little to choose from?
[11:26.80]I did rip out some of your data, but you still have a couple movies left.
[11:33.36]Simmons and Kane.
[11:35.76]Wow.
[11:37.84]That's a great media.
[11:39.12]I spent a few years at film school.
[11:42.03]Are you ready?
[11:43.14]I'll activate the arm wrestle module.
[11:47.14]Oh, thank you.
[11:49.16]Cry.
[11:49.64]It's the one-two punch of this race.
[11:51.42]Cry, cry.
[11:52.34]What do you think about spreading?
[11:54.02]Dude, my lines are clean right now.
[11:56.72]Spreading butter on toast.
[11:58.65]Yeah.
[11:58.87]That is delicious.
[11:59.93]Oh, there we go.
[12:01.21]Any other examples?
[12:04.27]Checking.
[12:05.15]No, it's okay.
[12:06.17]Checking the internet.
[12:08.79]Shufflebot, what do you know about sounding?
[12:11.36]You ever heard of like, jelking or like...
[12:15.19]These words are not in my database.
[12:17.43]What is destroyed?
[12:18.55]Destroyed is like how you destroy millions of jobs.
[12:22.05]Alright.
[12:23.61]The self-checkout machine has taken away a job from a human being and you're responsible.
[12:28.72]I apologize for the self-checkout machine.
[12:32.00]That doesn't fix anything.
[12:33.22]I think we're good.
[12:33.84]A bag onto the shelf.
[12:36.08]Don't do it.
[12:36.84]Don't do it.
[12:37.84]Oh, my God.
[12:39.12]It tells you, please pick up the bag.
[12:41.57]Please pick the bag up.
[12:44.13]Why is there not enough room for more than one bath?
[12:46.61]We're just waiting for Ludwig to water the bathroom and then the grand finale begins.
[12:52.45]Make sure his mic is turned off.
[12:55.03]Are those the movies that go brrr.
[13:00.00]Shuffler what's your favorite food?
[13:03.98]Clams.
[13:06.98]Shuffler, what's your favorite memory involving clams?
[13:12.98]On a ship, on the sea. Took a boat.
[13:36.00]This one's going to be a little different than the previous.
[13:38.00]We're running five different games at once.
[13:39.76]I'm going to need you to divert some of your power away from the voice module.
[13:43.05]To a movie?
[13:43.95]No.
[13:44.71]I am so proud of you for taking home the tournament.
[13:47.43]I'm so excited to reveal our grand prize, a reveal that is so incredible, so mysterious and magical, that we had to wait to the very end to show you.
[13:57.84]I'm scared.
[13:58.68]But I have to admit something to you all.
[14:02.84]The Shuffler...
[14:05.11]is not real.
[14:06.87]What?
[14:07.17]So hot?
[14:07.91]It was Jerma the whole time!
[14:10.45]What the hell?
[14:11.35]Because this isn't an AI, it doesn't make any sense.
[14:14.90]It was Jerma inside doing all the controls.
[14:18.16]Are you kidding me?
[14:19.34]What the hell is that?
[14:20.26]Why is there so much toilet paper?
[14:22.56]Hey!
[14:23.12]Jerma!
[14:24.98]Jerma!
[14:25.36]He's dressed as a Reddit mod.
[14:28.42]How you doing?
[14:28.78]How you doing?
[14:29.18]We found the winners.
[14:29.76]We finally found the winners.
[14:30.58]The winners, of course.
[14:31.46]They're right over here.
[14:32.28]Of course they are.
[14:33.02]Doug, hold on a second.
[14:34.56]Hey, what's up?
[14:35.76]When I was in there, I got pretty badly burned.
[14:39.70]Some of the wires in my... I leaned my head back.
[14:41.46]It's going to be okay.
[14:42.52]Shut the... Keep going.
[14:43.08]Keep going.
[14:43.70]I leaned my head back and I hit my head on a wire and I saw colors.
[14:47.20]So we have our two winners of the tournament.
[14:49.62]Joe and I worked hard at this.
[14:51.92]Yeah.
[14:52.54]Jerma, why don't you go ahead and congratulate our players?
[14:55.97]Of course we're going to congratulate the players.
[14:57.64]That's what I'm here to do.
[14:58.56]Hi.
[15:00.84]Hi.
[15:01.85]You've had a brain all along.
[15:03.39]Mr. Shuffler, thank you.
[15:04.17]It wasn't down here.
[15:05.09]It was up here, you fucking dummy.
[15:07.02]You're so right.
[15:08.06]You're so right.
[15:09.40]Everything you say hurts.
