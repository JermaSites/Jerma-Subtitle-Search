[00:12.83]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14.50]Welcome to episode 11, the Left 4 Dead episode.
[00:18.72]In this episode, I'm going to play Left 4 Dead for the first time in my life.
[00:22.88]But we're going to get this going.
[00:24.38]Just got to put a piece of toast in the toaster because buttered toast is the best gaming snack in the world.
[00:30.79]And if you don't agree with that, then you can just shove it right into your asshole.
[00:36.84]Okay, let's get out of this barn door here.
[00:39.42]And... Are these enemies?
[00:41.71]They're just kind of standing here.
[00:43.65]I don't... What are they... Hold on, this is moving.
[00:45.13]This is moving!
[00:45.65]This is moving!
[00:46.21]Okay, go, go!
[00:47.19]You never know when things are going to sneak up on you.
[00:49.33]So always check your back.
[00:52.28]Oh, um... Whoops-a-daisy.
[00:55.78]You know, I could say right now that this looks like a big red dick.
[01:00.34]But I'm not going to say that, because I'm better than that.
[01:03.87]Hello, sir.
[01:04.75]Welcome to Grandpa's Dr. Shack.
[01:07.63]I'm here to help you.
[01:08.55]Here to get you back to full health.
[01:10.22]Hello, Mrs. How are you?
[01:11.58]Gonna heal you.
[01:12.48]Dr. Grandpa's here to save the day.
[01:14.40]Come on, come on, come on.
[01:16.24]I gotta get this loaded.
[01:17.26]Heal myself quickly, quickly.
[01:18.42]Come on.
[01:19.06]I need this.
[01:19.62]Come on.
[01:20.66]Get off of me.

[01:23.68]Get the fuck out of here.
[01:24.94]Get back on this minigun.
[01:26.00]Come on.
[01:26.24]We gotta unload some clips on people.
[01:28.24]There we go.
[01:28.77]There we go.
[01:34.52]Listen, I don't really- WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!
[01:38.91]You two are doing a fine job down there!
[01:41.73]Just wanna let you know!
[01:42.67]Okay, gotta be tactical here!
[01:45.71]Tank is here, gotta be tactical!
[01:47.23]Go up the stairs, gonna wrap around the side... Shoot him, there he is!
[01:49.89]Oh my god, this is the scariest thing!
[01:51.19]Don't hit me with that rock!
[01:52.33]Fuck you!
[01:53.09]Oh, Lewis!
[01:53.89]Lewis, oh no!
[01:55.51]Lewis, I'm sorry!
[01:57.02]Come on now, come at me!
[01:58.20]You big, fat, fucking bastard!
[02:00.56]What do you got- Oh shit, I'm getting stuck on the wall!
[02:02.84]Come up here, come on!
[02:03.82]Come up here.
[02:04.54]What do you got?

[02:07.04]I got him.
[02:07.96]I am the champion.
[02:09.40]I am the fucking champion.
[02:11.06]What do you got on me?
[02:12.33]Nothing.
[02:12.85]Get out of here, boomer bitch.
[02:14.73]Okay, Lewis, let's... No, I'm not going to help him.
[02:17.47]I got to go.
[02:18.21]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[02:19.79]End of the level.
[02:20.55]This is it.
[02:21.67]I actually did it.
[02:22.99]I actually... What the fuck?
[02:25.86]You... Get off of me.
[02:27.70]No, you...
[02:29.25]Somebody take care of that.
[02:30.81]Who put the toast in here?
[02:32.79]The house is on fire.
[02:33.45]I've got to get out.
[02:34.77]What?
[02:35.55]Oh, my God.
[02:36.43]Oh, shit.
[02:38.64]Oh, my God.
[02:39.12]Save the cats.
[02:40.56]You've got to save my fucking cat.
