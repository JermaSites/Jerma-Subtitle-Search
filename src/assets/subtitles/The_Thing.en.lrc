[00:01.33]I'm actually seeing a few people do, say, Kurt Russell.
[00:05.75]Unfortunately, Kurt Russell is not in this game.
[00:11.59]But hello.
[00:15.25]This is a sequel.
[00:18.69]To the thing.
[00:19.59]And wait, I didn't even tell you what we're doing.
[00:21.09]I didn't even make a tweet.
[00:22.10]I'm not supposed to be here.
[00:25.16]I'm not supposed to be here.
[00:27.18]Let the intro play for like 30 seconds.
[00:29.60]I'll be right back.
[01:38.59]Okay.
[01:41.53]Hi, everybody.
[01:44.85]Today we're gonna play The Thing.
[01:48.95]In quotes, The Thing.
[01:50.35]The actual game, The Thing.
[01:51.95]This is a sequel to the movie, if you've ever seen the movie.
[02:00.66]It's a good one.
[02:05.00]It's a movie about deceit.
[02:06.16]A movie about...
[02:10.15]Who is it?
[02:11.80]Who did it?
[02:14.44]Without spoilers for a movie in the 80s.
[02:18.22]Oh, right.
[02:18.86]They remade this movie.
[02:21.80]I forgot about that.
[02:24.34]They did do a full remake of the thing a few years ago, didn't they?
[02:32.66]It was a prequel.
[02:36.09]Unfortunately.
[02:36.91]Was it not good?
[02:38.19]Was it F on Rotten Tomatoes?
[02:42.30]A thing.
[02:44.12]2016?
[02:44.14]2009?
[02:45.26]2011?
[02:45.34]Oh, not very good at all.
[02:52.16]This is 35% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[02:55.78]6% on IMDb, and... So this is not that good.
[03:00.34]Okay.
[03:00.84]Well, whatever.
[03:01.68]Forget about this one.
[03:06.16]If you get a 6% on IMDb... I don't know.
[03:10.74]Usually a 7 to 7.5 is every movie.
[03:15.54]If you're not every movie, then, you know, it's horrible.
[03:22.09]IGN gave it a 10 and a 10.
[03:23.39]They did not.
[03:25.69]What kind of boomer uses IMDb?
[03:28.77]I mean, it was listed on the... IMDb was listed there.
[03:34.43]It had some scary scenes.
[03:37.68]But, uh, we're gonna play the game- oh, okay, this is weird, because, so... This game is the sequel to the movie.
[03:43.74]And I believe it is canon.
[03:45.68]This is a canon game.
[03:50.94]So... Right?
[03:52.70]That's not incorrect.
[03:57.34]This game's also trash.
[03:59.64]Well, that's for you to say, and for me to find out.
[04:03.52]Because what if I love this game?
[04:04.70]I might like it.
[04:05.58]I might really like this game.
[04:09.22]It's a third-person shooter, scary, fun game.
[04:17.66]But yeah, that's what we're doing today.
[04:23.56]It's trash.
[04:24.35]It's trash.
[04:25.39]You don't even know that.
[04:26.41]You didn't even know what the thing was until we just talked about it for 10 minutes.
[04:32.67]You haven't even seen the movie.
[04:35.05]Raise your hand if you've seen the movie.
[04:38.17]I bet you half of you haven't even seen it.
[04:43.81]Here it is.
[04:48.58]Are we gonna get a recap?
[04:51.56]We might get a recap, so this'll be good.
[04:53.74]You guys ready?
[04:55.76]I am.
[04:59.58]Quiet during the cutscene.
[05:03.65]Ooh, okay.
[05:04.33]Normal, auto-aiming, hard, normal, or easy.
[05:14.32]No, this is a game from, like, 1998.
[05:16.35]I'm not doing hard.
[05:19.39]I'm doing normal.
[05:20.81]Always normal.
[05:22.23]Always normal.
[05:24.83]Jerma, the game is insanely hard.
[05:27.75]Okay, then I'm doing normal.
[05:33.02]No, I wanna be- It's not the same.
[05:37.18]It's not what you guys think.
[05:40.95]This isn't like it is now, where there's like six difficulties.
[05:45.37]And the first four of them are easy.
[05:47.49]No!
[05:48.23]This is back in the day when hard meant actually hard.
[05:55.56]You motherfuckers.
[05:56.34]La chou!
[06:03.31]La chou!
[06:06.68]Are these subtitles?
[06:08.19]Was it subtitles?
[06:10.11]Could I put subtitles on?
[06:13.25]What is going on?
[06:44.03]That's not me laughing I know it sounds like it, but it's not
[06:59.54]I gotta turn subtitles on.
[07:00.80]And the game's on fucking hard.
[07:02.34]What the hell?
[07:03.98]This is not gonna be fun.
[07:04.76]David Hayter?
[07:05.22]Are we sure?
[07:29.68]Understood.
[07:30.70]Do a recon.
[07:31.40]See if you can find anything that'll give us an idea what happened.
[07:34.29]I could try to get the chopper back to you within an hour, but visibility's falling fast and the report for your area is not very good.
[07:40.71]Okay.
[07:41.83]We'll make a sweep and report back.
[07:44.67]Roger.
[07:44.99]Meanwhile, I'll check up on Alpha Team.
[07:48.21]Or Blake.
[07:50.30]Are we jumping out of the helicopter in the air?
[07:52.66]Okay, no.
[07:53.70]I was saying, we don't have... Keep your team together and...
[07:57.56]Get them to shelter as quickly as you can.
[07:59.98]Roger that.
[08:01.18]Blake out.
[08:02.36]Okay.
[08:03.80]The snow is pretty... Alright, as you play through the first four levels, text pop-ups like this one will come on screen from time to time to explain different parts of the game to you.
[08:12.71]You can skip them by pressing the escape button, or turn them off entirely by pressing the escape button to bring up the pause menu.
[08:20.75]So, I don't want to skip it.
[08:25.58]and then selecting options.
[08:27.31]You can then switch the tutorials off by entering the game settings menu.
[08:31.91]However, they will teach you how to play the game, so it's suggested that you read each tutorial at least once.
[08:37.18]More help and advice can be found in the field manual.
[08:40.28]You can find the field manual in the pause menu by pressing the escape button.
[08:45.46]Something to note about this game that you guys need to know.
[08:48.95]You can softlock yourself in this game.
[08:52.07]There are people that if you kill them, you could ruin the whole game.
[08:55.41]So I've been told to pay attention because you're going to fuck up the whole game is what I've been told.
[09:02.12]Good.
[09:02.58]Alright.
[09:04.67]Cold exposure.
[09:05.37]It's 40 degrees below zero in the Antarctic.
[09:08.13]And so whenever you're outside, you'll suffer from the cold.
[09:11.10]An exposure meter, it's the blue meter at the bottom of the screen, will show you how much time you have until temperatures begin to actually harm you and take away from your health.
[09:21.48]So I have a meter at the bottom that when the meter is depleted, that's when I take, like, dot damage.
[09:29.32]Okay.
[09:29.48]Okay.
[09:32.23]As you play the game, you will be given objectives.
[09:34.03]These appear in the top left hand corner of the screen and are color coded.
[09:37.68]Green text shows that an objective is still active and orange text means an objective has been completed.
[09:44.72]You can check the status of all of your objectives by pressing the F button to enter the keys, documents and objectives menu.
[09:53.43]Once in this screen, move the mouse up to highlight the document icon and then press the enter button to view your objectives.
[10:02.66]So F. Alright, so green means it's what you're currently on.
[10:05.98]Orange is completed.
[10:08.00]Retrieve evidence and rescue any survivors.
[10:10.10]Keep the team alive.
[10:10.96]So this is my team.
[10:12.40]Alright, hold on.
[10:15.57]It's cold.
[10:16.19]I gotta turn on game settings.
[10:20.21]Tutorials on auto-aiming hard.
[10:23.87]I'm so glad I can change that.
[10:25.35]Okay, is there a audio-video?
[10:29.25]No.
[10:31.49]Advanced controls.
[10:32.90]There are no subtitles.
[10:34.38]You guys are gonna have to pay attention.
[10:42.27]No.
[10:43.33]There are no subtitles in this whole game.
[10:46.09]Good luck.
[10:48.99]Here we go.
[10:52.53]Okay, retrieve.
[10:53.13]What was it?
[10:54.45]So we have to explode.
[10:55.17]We gotta get out.
[10:55.71]It's cold right now.
[10:56.47]We gotta get out of here.
[10:58.15]Okay, I just right... I hit the right click button.
[11:00.75]And all of a sudden, I am holding a flare in my hands.
[11:02.93]I don't know what the controls are.
[11:04.84]I don't want to softlock myself.
[11:06.36]Somebody take this.
[11:07.30]Okay.
[11:08.46]How do I open doors?
[11:09.20]Oh.
[11:20.52]I need subtitles.
[11:21.68]It's Leonardo from the Ninja Turtles.
[11:23.30]Squad member.
[11:23.96]Communication.
[11:48.14]Your squad is made up of three different character classes that you can tell apart by their headgear.
[11:52.88]Soldiers always have a tough camouflage helmet on.
[11:55.77]Engineers don't go anywhere without their trusty cap.
[12:00.69]Camouflage is soldier.
[12:02.45]Engineer, trusty cap.
[12:05.33]And medics like to keep warm in a beanie with a red cross on the front.
[12:11.20]Why couldn't they just... I can just remember that.
[12:14.64]I'll start to build a relationship with these people.
[12:18.85]Wait, actually, this is good for me, because I'll just be like, oh, red cross hat!
[12:23.17]Alright, that's good.
[12:24.07]The members of your squad are very much alive.
[12:25.67]They blink, they fidget when they are bored, and they think for themselves.
[12:30.93]Be careful how you treat them, as they are all trained veterans.
[12:36.23]Even if they are unarmed, they won't hesitate to take you down if they decide you are acting suspiciously.
[12:42.25]They will also communicate with you, both verbally and with the use of icons that appear over their heads.
[12:49.43]For an explanation of the overhead icons, refer to your field manual.
[12:53.76]Okay.
[12:54.72]You guys didn't think that this was gonna be a fucked up game.
[12:58.10]Well... Let's wrap in.
[13:00.92]As has already been explained, your squadmates are intelligent people, and they will react to your actions based on how much they trust you.
[13:07.33]When you enter the squad manual, you will see a bar above the names of each squad member that shows their current level of trust.
[13:15.18]For any squad member, if his level of trust is in the green section, it means he trusts you and will take orders and help you throughout your mission.
[13:24.04]If his level of trust is in the orange section, it means he doesn't trust you and he won't help you, but he isn't yet convinced you're an enemy, so he won't attack you either.
[13:33.51]If his level of trust is in the red section, it means he doesn't trust you at all and sees you as an enemy.
[13:41.61]Okay, so green is good.
[13:44.22]Yellow is cautious.
[13:46.20]And red is, I'm going to kill you.
[13:49.84]Where's the field menu?
[13:51.96]Oy yi yi.
[13:52.82]Commanding your squad.
[13:55.06]You're in for a long one.
[13:57.00]Giving weapons.
[13:57.66]You can give items to your squad by accessing the squad menu.
[14:01.49]Selecting the squad member you want to interact with and then selecting the give weapon option.
[14:06.35]Your weapon inventory screen will then come up and you can give weapons.
[14:09.47]You can do the same thing.
[14:12.48]Squad menu.
[14:13.28]Everything's in the squad menu.
[14:14.44]Orders.
[14:14.88]Squad menu.
[14:16.44]You can issue various orders to your squad members.
[14:19.99]Squad menu.
[14:20.87]From the squad menu, you can issue a group command to all your squad members, telling them to either stay guard or follow you.
[14:28.06]You can do an individual squad member menu.
[14:30.46]You can issue an individual command to stay guard or follow you, as well as send squad member to a location you've identified.
[14:35.92]To tell your group for an individual squad member to stay or guard or follow you, access the squad menu.
[14:41.29]Alright, it's all in the squad menu.
[14:44.14]Follow state, yeah, overhead.
[14:45.33]Okay, here we go.
[14:46.69]Overhead icons are one way in which your squad members communicate with you.
[14:51.65]Here are all of them.
[14:53.61]Different icons and what they mean.
[14:57.34]This is important.
[14:58.76]This is important.
[14:59.54]This is important.
[15:00.18]This is important.
[15:02.50]I'm going to read this because I need to know.
[15:06.20]So this is the trust and fear icons.
[15:07.99]My trust has gone from high to low.
[15:12.13]My trust has gone from low to 0.
[15:15.06]My trust has gone from low to enemy level 1.
[15:19.34]My trust has gone from low to enemy level 2.
[15:22.82]My trust has gone from low to enemy level 3.
[15:24.68]What is that?
[15:25.04]Does that mean I'm going to throw a grenade in the room?
[15:28.42]What's the different enemy levels?
[15:32.39]So at enemy level 3, I now see the player as an enemy.
[15:35.95]And then going the other way too.
[15:38.29]So we have to build trust with everybody here.
[15:41.66]So my trust has gone from high to buddy.
[15:44.06]My trust has gone from buddy to high.
[15:45.66]Alright.
[15:48.96]So this is what we're looking for.
[15:52.38]Trust.
[15:54.09]My fear has gone from danger to crack up level 2.
[15:58.49]My fear has gone from danger to crack up level 3.
[16:03.13]Alright.
[16:03.57]I think I'm starting to understand.
[16:05.99]I'm talking.
[16:06.89]Enemy spotted.
[16:09.90]I'm losing health.
[16:14.29]I am in man down.
[16:17.25]Trust.
[16:18.37]Synopsis.
[16:19.25]If your squad members don't trust you, they won't do anything for you.
[16:22.40]Got it.
[16:24.12]Alright, how do we... How do you save the game?
[16:32.25]Oh shit, this is an old game.
[16:35.95]Junction boxes.
[16:39.01]Whenever you see the hand icon, it means that you can do something by pressing the E button.
[16:42.73]Yeah, okay, right.
[16:44.31]The junction box in front of you is a basic one.
[16:46.15]When you walk up to it, yeah, I know you press E to open stuff.
[16:51.11]Okay, when you walk right up to it, a message will appear in the center of the screen to tell you the name of the junction box.
[16:54.78]You will also see a picture of a hand and a yellow bar at the bottom of the screen.
[16:58.06]This tells you that you can fix this junction box yourself.
[17:02.46]Okay.
[17:03.12]To fix it, press and hold E. You'll see the yellow bar start to fill up.
[17:06.40]When it is full, the repair is complete.
[17:07.77]You can release the interact button at any time to stop fixing the junction box.
[17:11.19]If you then return to it and hold the E button, the repair will continue from where you left off.
[17:15.63]Good.
[17:18.92]Okay.
[17:22.06]I couldn't do it.
[17:23.46]I mean, you can't.
[17:25.50]I'm doing it.
[17:27.94]I would scream at you right now, but I need you to trust me.
[17:31.91]okay what why did this room explode whenever you've got low enough health or any of your squad members are hurt bad enough that they go into the man down state so when you're kneeling on the floor be careful when a member of your squad is in this state it's only a matter of time until they die unless they're healed bring your medic within close proximity to the injured person and he will automatically heal them
[17:59.99]The medics you meet throughout the game can heal any member of your squad, with the exception of themselves.
[18:05.00]So you will need to keep an eye on your medic's health and heal him yourself when he is injured.
[18:11.02]So, heal me.
[18:14.40]How many of those do you have?
[18:17.46]Alright, what is this?
[18:21.10]Gun?
[18:22.96]Gun, clips?
[18:24.62]Ooh, ammo too.
[18:29.88]That's all I can take.
[18:30.52]Area secure.
[18:32.16]What about this thing?
[18:33.36]Turn it on?
[18:36.12]Did I just lock myself in, like, a freezer?
[18:37.52]What?
[18:37.88]No.
[18:38.06]Alright.
[18:40.61]Okay.
[18:42.33]So, how do I... What's a squad menu?
[18:49.15]Where's... These guys... Q is squad menu.
[18:52.46]Okay.
[18:55.94]Alright, so this is Weldon Burrows North.
[18:58.80]Does Weldon have a gun?
[19:00.34]You do now.
[19:00.76]Why does it have zero?
[19:12.18]Oh yeah, here you go.
[19:12.78]Alright, you got a gun now.
[19:14.12]Now you can defend yourself.
[19:18.66]Look.
[19:19.86]Plus, we're buddies now.
[19:21.34]We're now friends.
[19:23.63]nice alright that's how it works can you give like food and stuff and like alright hold on is there a flashlight no that's f okay now what do we do do I have a map can we move this out of the way is there a crouch can somebody get in there
[19:57.64]What the fuck is going on?
[20:03.64]Is there a flashlight in this game?
[20:05.68]How do I turn on the flashlight?
[20:09.16]There is no flashlight.
[20:12.25]Oh god damn it.
[20:20.95]Alright, explore over here.
[20:22.29]Where's my squad?
[20:28.76]Oh my... Would that have killed me?
[20:32.14]Maybe.
[20:32.46]I don't know.
[20:40.44]Alright.
[20:49.17]One of these guys is going to get hit in the head with one of these, and it's going to be all my fault.
[20:52.25]This way.
[20:53.79]In here.
[20:55.83]Oh, of course.
[20:56.73]Not all doors will require you to fix a junction box.
[20:59.38]Some of them are just plain locked.
[21:02.16]The door in front of you is locked, and you need to find the key in order to open it.
[21:05.34]The key could be nearby or far away, or on a table, or in the hand of a corpse.
[21:11.10]Whenever you find the key for a locked door, simply return to it, and it will open automatically.
[21:15.56]Here's a hint.
[21:16.44]The key to this door is hidden underground.
[21:18.22]Oh, that's wonderful.
[21:26.61]Underground.
[21:27.95]I don't have a map, do I?
[21:30.39]What are you guys doing?
[21:31.89]Face cam, face cam, face cam.
[21:33.47]Or enemy level 3.
[21:35.67]What?
[21:38.37]Alright, alright, alright!
[21:39.51]You guys are going to crash my game.
[21:46.99]Hold on a second.
[21:48.07]Can I even... Hold on.
[21:52.65]I'm not even sure.
[21:53.19]Can I even do this?
[21:55.47]I don't think my webcam's even plugged in.
[21:59.78]Facecam or enemy level three, give me a break.
[22:02.80]What's even plugged in here?
[22:04.76]Oh, get this out of here.
[22:06.14]Alright, alright, I'll do it fine.
[22:16.81]I'm doing it.
[22:17.49]I'm doing, I'm putting the facecam on.
[22:25.65]Faster.
[22:27.35]What happened to you guys?
[22:40.52]Why is everybody fucking drinking the stuff under the sink again?
[22:43.62]Alright, that should work.

[23:36.19]No, it's called the I don't care wallpaper.
[23:38.63]Because wallpapers get in my way.
[23:40.93]And when I have something... I mean, for a while, it was Pac-Man.
[23:45.87]And then it turned into Carnage.
[23:47.65]And then it turned into Mysterio.
[23:49.85]And it just gets too much back there.
[23:52.20]I need just a default background where my icons can go.
[23:56.74]Because it hurts your eyes.
[23:58.32]Some of these images are so fucked up looking.
[24:02.24]Alright, let's go.
[24:03.70]I don't remember what the fuck I was even doing, but let's go.
[24:12.70]Just put a, just put a black canvas?
[24:15.76]I could do that, but that's boring.
[24:18.92]Alright.
[24:20.52]So, uh, underground.
[24:21.73]Have we seen anything underground?
[24:32.64]This is cl- I mean, we're safe.
[24:35.48]I wish I had a flashlight.
[24:36.60]I'm gonna turn up the brightness.
[24:38.16]Don't get mad at me.
[24:51.08]There is no brightness.
[24:53.48]Turn off face cam.
[25:05.11]No.
[25:06.54]Now it's staying on for good.
[25:08.16]Alright, I need to find an underground tunnel or something.
[25:17.26]Underground.
[25:28.13]I've ruined it.
[25:28.73]Turn it off.
[25:29.62]It's deep underground.
[25:36.48]You guys are fucked.
[25:47.21]You know when the chapstick comes out, the shit's getting real on the stream.
[25:50.35]You know that, right?
[25:50.95]Alright, it's definitely going to be down right over by the... Why would it tell me to go look over here?
[25:57.92]He's insulting us.
[26:02.16]Well, you guys are acting like fucking goddamn werewolves!
[26:06.76]It has to be over here.
[26:19.62]No, it's not.
[26:20.98]Maybe it's all the way down.
[26:23.17]I can't... Can I sneak in here?
[26:27.69]No.
[26:29.53]Alright, do we have enough human battery power to go this way?
[26:46.40]Where the fuck do I go?
[26:50.79]We're all gonna die.
[26:53.95]Underground.
[26:58.91]Wait, I gotta get inside first before I run around in a circle.
[27:04.47]We're not gonna die right now, right?
[27:05.51]Just get in here.
[27:09.17]Oops.
[27:14.77]I just, I wish I could see better.
[27:16.41]Alright, we good?
[27:20.19]We're like, we're dying now.
[27:22.35]I have to like actually go into this building?
[27:25.89]What?
[27:27.52]Alright, get in here, come on.
[27:29.58]Get over here.
[27:36.76]Yes, it does, alright.
[27:40.82]Let's try this again.
[27:46.29]No, not this way.
[27:50.19]Follow the blue lights?
[27:51.17]Yeah, that's what I was doing, but I... I was... dying.
[27:54.95]I was... my... cold meter was going down.
[27:58.04]You'll be alright.
[28:09.16]Alright.
[28:13.40]What's over here?
[28:13.84]Any items?

[28:17.31]What is with this camera?
[28:21.39]Sorry!

[29:17.95]Alright, so we're gonna give... Give to squad member.
[29:28.43]I can't give that to you.
[29:29.45]Okay.

[30:14.79]Yeah, yeah, we're not alone in the universe and all that crap.
[30:17.79]Check it out and move on.
[30:22.67]Is this the key?
[30:23.71]There's the key.
[30:24.29]Why is it so quiet?
[30:35.42]I don't like how quiet it is.
[30:42.94]Where's our other guy?
[30:45.01]Where's our other guy?
[30:47.23]Where's the other guy?
[30:47.79]Uh, the other guy's the thing.
[30:54.41]I knew I should have shot that guy in the beginning.
[31:03.58]What are you doing out here?
[31:04.22]Why didn't you come in with us?
[31:06.74]Huh.
[31:07.34]Okay, keep your eye on the medic.
[31:12.43]supplies over here I'm gonna hide this tape when I'm finished if none of us make it at least there'll be some kind of a record the storm's been hitting us pretty hard now is that Kurt Russell 48 hours we still have nothing to go on one other thing I think it rips through your clothes when it takes you over windows found some shredded long johns but the name tag was missing
[31:42.12]Movie.
[32:08.97]Yeah, remember when everyone lied about seeing the original movie?
[32:12.45]I know you did now.
[32:25.87]That's offensive to me.
[32:26.97]I love the thing.
[32:28.39]I'm glad you did.
[32:29.29]It's a great movie.
[32:34.74]Remember when no one knows what a cassette tape is?
[32:36.94]Alright.
[32:38.36]Gain access to the infirmary completed.
[32:40.10]Uh... What is that?
[32:46.45]Uh-oh.
[32:49.95]Here, take some bullets.
[32:51.95]Maybe that'll make you like me again.
[32:55.45]The virus has the ability to replicate the original biological entity, including the clothing.
[33:01.14]Could be anybody.
[33:01.80]It's so dark in here!
[33:03.38]Do- I don't have any light?
[33:05.82]Please don't tell me that I'm a fucking idiot and I'm gonna play this whole game without a flashlight.
[33:10.03]And it's like tea.
[33:28.48]Power supply?
[33:31.04]Advanced Junction Boxes In front of you is an Advanced Junction Box and can only be fixed by your Engineer.
[33:39.67]I've paraphrased.
[33:41.05]To get your Engineer to fix an Advanced Junction Box, you need to first identify the Junction Box by walking up to it until its name appears as you would for a basic Junction Box.
[33:51.00]There are two ways that you can ask your engineer to fix it.
[33:54.04]First, if your engineer is close enough to the junction box, the I can fix it icon will appear automatically over his head.
[34:01.43]This allows you to walk right up to him and then press E, which tells him to fix the junction box.
[34:06.73]The second way to have your engineer fix the junction box is to bring up the squad menu by pressing Q, select your engineer, then select the go to option,
[34:16.71]And lastly, select the junction box you want him to fix.
[34:19.97]He will then go fix it.
[34:22.87]Can you fix this?
[34:31.12]Go fix it.
[34:36.30]The medic with the gun just looks like he's never held one before.
[34:39.50]It's freaking me out.
[34:45.65]You're holding that like a GoldenEye NPC, and that's not how it works.
[34:53.47]Okay, so... We're gonna go... through here.
[34:58.96]Access codes.
[35:00.68]The door in front of you is the access code door, and you'll need an access code for it to open.
[35:06.10]Access codes can be found written down and as part of a computer terminal message, or you'll find it somehow.
[35:13.00]You do not have to make a note of these codes, as Blake can remember them.
[35:17.07]Why can't I remember them?
[35:19.17]Am I in trouble with that?
[35:21.09]Why do one of my squad members have to do this?
[35:25.63]When you've found the access code for a door, go up to the access panel next to the door and press E.
[35:30.68]Look for the access code to this door and return when you found it.
[35:33.58]Hint, access codes are usually just a series of numbers and may not be obviously labeled.
[35:44.51]An infected entity has the ability to fragment and survive every part of it as a whole.
[35:52.05]Oh, the lights just turned back on, right.
[35:54.05]Alright.
[35:55.59]Oh Christ, what is that?
[35:59.18]You didn't see that?
[36:02.00]That was a late reaction.
[36:09.34]Uh-oh.
[36:11.21]Your squad members are always conscious of their circumstances and the environment around them.
[36:15.89]And when they've seen too much, they will begin to lose it.
[36:19.45]To see how a squad member is handling his situation, activate the squad menu.
[36:23.93]Press the Q button and pay attention to his picture.
[36:26.75]If he's doing okay, he'll casually be looking from left to right.
[36:30.06]If he's noticeably frightened, he'll be looking all around at a panicked speed.
[36:34.76]If he's close to outright losing it and cracking up, he'll be shaking uncontrollably.
[36:40.54]To reduce your squad member's fear, try giving him a weapon.
[36:44.22]Or get him to follow you out of the area.
[36:46.80]Refer to your field manual to find out about different things you can do to calm your squad members when fear gets to them.
[36:51.84]Why would I give him a weapon?
[36:55.46]Are you good?
[36:55.84]I mean, I gave you a weapon, but you're not doing alright.
[37:01.38]You, follow me.
[37:03.38]Come here.
[37:05.80]Follow me.
[37:09.54]Go to... How do I say follow me?
[37:15.20]Just come over here.
[37:16.90]Follow me over here.
[37:18.92]You come over here and just stay over here.
[37:20.43]Okay.
[37:22.89]Stay.
[37:25.11]Don't move.
[37:28.83]There we go.
[37:29.31]See?
[37:30.25]I did it just fine.
[37:35.77]I've compiled a five-page report from the autopsy performed on the anomalous corpse that was discovered at the Norwegian outpost.
[37:43.17]It appears that what we are dealing with is some kind of self-repairing entity that has the ability to morph itself into different biological forms.
[37:52.08]Access to medical supplies is limited to myself and Gary.
[37:58.70]Code 1138.
[38:03.48]Okay.
[38:03.84]1138.
[38:03.86]Junction box.
[38:04.60]I can do this.
[38:05.30]Actually, you know what?
[38:06.84]Yeah, you do it.
[38:07.44]We're friends.
[38:10.74]Okay.
[38:35.09]Saving the game!
[38:36.11]Oh... Oh no.
[38:43.41]It's only in specific save points?
[38:47.33]Oh, that sucks.
[38:53.00]It's like Resident Evil.
[38:54.50]Thankfully I can do it as many times as I want.
[38:56.34]Ooh, medical bags?
[38:58.52]Where's the medic?
[39:02.01]Wait a minute.
[39:02.85]He's been fucking acting really weird.
[39:04.91]See?
[39:11.52]Let's go.
[39:14.26]You told him to do that.
[39:18.10]Yeah, but still.
[39:19.76]Alright, come over here.
[39:21.28]Medic, go over here and open up the medic slot.
[39:24.68]Go to... Do you need these?
[39:29.25]I guess you don't.
[39:29.77]Wouldn't you just go get them automatically?
[39:32.49]Alright, anything else over here I need to look at?
[39:38.38]No.
[39:38.60]Game is saved.
[39:39.06]Let's go.
[39:50.44]What's this?
[39:52.28]Oh, that's... Oh, shit.
[39:55.13]What is this?
[39:55.45]I don't even know what that was.
[39:57.63]Alright, nothing else in here.
[40:03.71]We've been out here for 15 seconds.
[40:05.19]You're gonna be fine.
[40:17.94]What's in the corner?
[40:18.76]Whitley, this is Blake.
[40:21.02]What have you got?
[40:22.45]One body.
[40:22.97]Identification says child.
[40:24.61]No survivors.
[40:26.35]And what appears to be one body.
[40:28.97]And, and, and, and what?
[40:31.15]And, and, and, and, and what'd you say, son?
[40:33.35]I didn't pick that up.
[40:34.13]It looks, well, like a UFO.
[40:39.97]Colonel.
[40:42.27]Colonel.
[40:43.07]Roger.
[40:43.65]I'll have a chopper there ASAP.
[40:45.33]There's a supply crate that was dropped earlier near the base.
[40:47.53]I like this accidentally called my grandfather.
[40:49.55]I want you to rig all the remaining buildings and I'll remote detonate them from here.
[40:53.05]Affirmative.
[40:54.07]I'll contact you when we're finished.
[40:56.14]Wait, what did you say, Jeremy?
[40:57.07]You said there was a body?
[40:58.99]What was the next part?
[41:00.39]Oh, fuck.
[41:01.23]That's Grandpa.
[41:01.91]I'm going to call my supervisor, actually, this time.
[41:08.27]Collect the C4 explosives.
[41:10.03]Plant C4 in the infirmary.
[41:11.57]Plant C4 in the radio room.
[41:15.68]Okay, so the radio room was back here.
[41:21.28]God damn it.
[41:22.02]Okay.
[41:23.18]Anything else that I have here?
[41:25.52]Nope.
[41:28.85]The radio room was with the Kurt Russell room, right?
[41:32.47]And then the infirmary was with the guys lying down.
[41:36.98]I can't get the whiskey.
[41:37.72]It's not gettable.
[41:42.68]Save it.
[41:52.69]Medic checked.
[41:58.14]No.
[41:58.54]Medic's here.
[42:08.95]Okay.
[42:09.61]I'm just trying to see if they do anything that's, like, alien-like.
[42:12.51]So, okay.
[42:13.05]Explode this room.
[42:17.43]How do I blow the... How do I do this?
[42:19.55]This is the infirmary right here, right?
[42:20.73]It has to be.
[42:21.67]So how do I do that?
[42:22.25]E?
[42:24.27]E?
[42:30.03]Plant C- maybe over here?
[42:31.40]Oh, right here.
[42:34.62]Now how do I- Infirmary and then the radio room is back here.
[42:39.54]Right?
[42:40.51]So how do I- can I blow it up?
[42:44.33]Shoot the C4.
[42:45.09]Get out of the room.
[43:00.97]What?
[43:06.51]It doesn't do anything.
[43:11.25]No, it's not the game you think it is.
[43:16.04]That's not how C4 works.
[43:18.10]Right.
[43:18.34]Alright, then the... What's down here?
[43:23.08]Oh wait, this is the... Is it fall damage?
[43:24.60]Fall damage?
[43:30.55]No, this is where I was before.
[43:31.39]This is the... This shit.
[43:35.97]Wasn't the radio?
[43:36.73]No.
[43:37.15]I remember this.
[43:37.95]I got stuck here.
[43:39.69]And then... Where's the radio?
[43:40.97]I don't think it's down here.
[43:44.64]This is where the UFO is.
[43:47.32]Was it over here?
[43:47.86]Yeah, this is where the UFO... Why would I not want to blow up the UFO?
[43:56.02]It's back where I started, yeah.
[43:56.94]That's right.
[44:03.87]Wait.
[44:09.52]Radio.
[44:10.52]This is the radio room.
[44:12.98]Gotta be more specific.
[44:15.22]I guess that's like Kurt Russell's radio room.
[44:20.64]Engineer is missing.
[44:21.62]No, the engineer is not missing.
[44:22.92]The engineer is here somewhere.
[44:26.58]Oh, the engineer actually is missing right now.
[44:28.64]You're right.
[44:29.94]Where is this person?
[44:33.48]Me too, but where's the engineer?
[44:37.40]That's weird.
[44:38.02]Why are you not here?
[44:38.88]He's probably stuck in a wall somewhere.
[44:41.18]Yeah, there he is.
[44:43.46]Well, I don't know what you're doing here either, but you're here.
[44:49.11]Can I wrap around?
[44:56.89]You can't climb over that?
[44:58.07]Are you serious?
[45:00.30]He's infected.
[45:01.64]He's not infected.
[45:05.94]Why can't I just walk around?
[45:08.40]I have to go in and then around.
[45:13.33]Everybody just follow me and relax.
[45:15.61]You're going to be fine.
[45:20.89]I'm freezing?
[45:21.49]Not yet.
[45:26.59]So this is here.
[45:27.59]But no, I have to go that way.
[45:30.21]Wait, what is this?
[45:34.17]50 and 70% chance of infection.
[45:36.99]Contact with an infected entity does not guarantee infection.
[45:40.41]What is this?
[45:42.15]You just picked up an adrenaline hypo.
[45:45.35]In situations where squad members are suffering from extreme stress, you can syringe them to calm them down.
[45:54.07]Go to your inventory and then press enter on the icon in the center of the screen to take you to your items.
[46:00.85]Move the mouse in the direction of the adrenaline syringe.
[46:03.66]Press enter when it's highlighted.
[46:04.94]Now press the escape button to return to the game and approach the squad member we usually use adrenaline on.
[46:10.76]That's a fucking mouthful.
[46:11.90]Okay, hold on a second.
[46:12.74]Inventory.
[46:13.28]Adrenaline.
[46:20.97]Escape.
[46:23.51]And then, what was it?
[46:25.15]Right mouse button?
[46:26.77]I don't want to do it.
[46:30.09]Okay, that's how you put stuff here.
[46:31.19]Okay, so I'm going to put the... Let's keep that on.
[46:35.29]Okay, cool.
[46:37.56]Alright, now... How did I get... I came in through here.
[46:43.76]And then how did I get... I ran like all the way down here, right?
[46:49.71]I'm going the right way, right?
[46:50.73]There's like two different buildings.
[46:54.41]No.
[46:54.57]No.
[46:58.08]It's... Follow the light.
[47:00.06]That's... No, that's what I just did.
[47:02.43]Is it out... But you can't go anywhere from here.
[47:04.03]Oh, here we go.
[47:06.05]Right, right, right.
[47:06.55]Yeah.
[47:07.69]That's what... I was trying to get in this building.
[47:09.01]This is the only one way I could get in.
[47:10.83]Alright.
[47:12.85]I do too.
[47:13.31]I can't wait till we don't have to see it again.
[47:15.14]Alright, so which is... Technically, what's the radio room right here?
[47:22.34]There it is.
[47:25.10]Return to the evac point.
[47:30.42]Where's the fucking evac point?
[47:35.42]The place with all the flares?
[47:36.40]Over here?
[47:57.87]Was it all the way?
[47:58.47]All the way in the... All the way at the beginning where I started.
[48:01.11]That was the evac point.
[48:02.31]Right.
[48:02.67]Okay.
[48:09.78]Dude, the invention of like the Fable breadcrumb trail has ruined all of us.
[48:15.76]Especially me.
[48:16.34]You know, I used to play games like this and I would have to know where I was going.
[48:21.02]And then all of a sudden Fable 2 came along and added a GTA GPS system.
[48:25.84]It was never the same ever again.
[48:28.32]Is it guns on the ground?
[48:31.26]What is all this?
[48:34.68]Holy shit, why are there so many of these on the ground?
[48:36.68]I have five of them, alright.
[48:46.51]So where's the evac point, then?
[48:47.99]Isn't this where we landed?
[48:52.45]Come get us!
[48:58.12]Come get us.
[48:59.32]I'm ready to be picked up.
[49:10.82]What?
[49:14.60]This is the beginning.
[49:16.18]This is the very beginning.
[49:19.21]The thing is in the chat right now.
[49:23.19]Probably, but isn't this not where I need to be right now?
[49:31.39]Oh fuck, everyone's gonna die.
[49:32.41]Alright, I gotta get back inside.
[49:37.57]Where I got the C4?
[49:38.81]Hold on.
[49:45.64]Oh my god, we're all dead.
[49:48.16]Hurry up and get the fuck in here.
[49:51.47]Wait, past the infirmary?
[49:53.35]I...
[49:55.75]Hold on a second.
[49:56.47]I... I didn't... I thought everybody was saying I had to go back to the very beginning where I got... Like, where I started.
[50:01.01]Like, here.
[50:05.60]Go back to the save point.
[50:11.36]Maybe it's where I found the C4.
[50:14.36]I guess, yeah.
[50:15.86]I don't know.
[50:16.18]Oh, at the evac point.
[50:22.35]Everyone is wrong.
[50:24.62]Go through the infirmary.
[50:25.64]Fucking god damn it.
[50:35.35]We're all wrong.
[50:36.73]Go through the infirmary.
[50:44.75]So here's the save point.
[50:48.26]And now...
[50:52.45]It's what I said in the very beginning, isn't it?
[50:54.43]It's the flares on the ground.
[50:58.03]This has to be the evac point.
[50:59.49]This is like, look at this.
[51:00.37]This is the evac point.
[51:01.71]I knew it.
[51:02.93]I knew it.
[51:04.69]Standing by for evac.
[51:06.52]Anything from Alpha Team?
[51:08.84]Negative.
[51:10.14]Could be the storm.
[51:11.88]Must be.
[51:12.68]God damn it.
[51:13.40]I've been getting partial transmissions for the last hour or so.
[51:17.77]I'm going to assemble my team.
[51:19.83]We're good.
[51:20.21]When the chopper arrives, I'll have it drop me at Alpha's rendezvous.
[51:24.01]Wait, this is not my team?
[51:25.57]You have your orders, Captain.
[51:27.35]Don't put this mission in jeopardy.
[51:28.91]I understand, Colonel, but I don't have much choice.
[51:31.91]Pierce's team is in trouble.
[51:33.53]Besides, if there are any survivors, I'm the only one on the team that speaks Norwegian.
[51:38.31]Blake out.
[51:46.74]Why would you do that?
[51:49.65]Blake, do you read me?
[51:51.03]Why wouldn't you have, like, five people that could speak the region?
[51:53.67]Can you count anyone yet?
[51:55.35]Nothing yet.
[51:56.17]I just arrived.
[51:57.59]The storm is worsening.
[51:59.17]May take a while to find anything.
[52:01.49]Looks like that little stunt of yours might pay off.
[52:04.13]I don't understand, Colonel.
[52:05.73]I received a partial transmission from Pierce.
[52:08.59]He's found something.
[52:09.77]Might be research.
[52:11.67]Find him and get back to me ASAP.
[52:13.83]Affirmative.
[52:14.91]Did he say if there were any hostiles in the area?
[52:17.49]Negative.
[52:18.87]No hostiles.
[52:20.21]Okay, I'm on it.
[52:20.97]Blake out.
[52:21.81]This is like Jack Nicholson's snake.
[52:24.39]It's not the regular snake.
[52:25.89]Okay, light poles exist to guide people from one location to another when blizzards hamper visibility.
[52:31.59]Use them to help you discover new areas, but don't be afraid to explore beyond them.
[52:36.75]So just follow the blue brick road.
[52:41.93]Rescue alpha team.
[52:42.73]I don't have any guns.
[52:45.70]Okay.
[52:47.90]Light bulb.
[52:48.84]Christ, that's got to be a few thousand volts.
[52:51.50]I got to find the power source.
[52:53.70]In the dryer vents?
[52:56.98]Okay, I don't want to die.
[53:00.00]Power source is like over here.
[53:10.57]Ooh, what's... Somebody just lit... Somebody just lit this.
[53:13.09]Couldn't have been here too long.
[53:20.13]Am I reloaded?
[53:23.44]That's not going to shock me, right?
[53:34.74]Power supply.
[53:36.58]I can't do this, though.
[53:38.06]I'm not smart enough.
[53:38.80]Yes, I am.
[53:43.66]Alright.
[53:48.50]Wait.
[53:53.77]I'm pretty messed up.
[53:57.17]Uh-oh.
[53:58.67]Oh, shit.
[53:59.11]Wait, did somebody in here that... Did I just get a bad ending?
[54:03.46]Did I take too long?
[54:06.14]Identify yourself.
[54:07.44]Wait, what?
[54:08.62]Captain, it's Carter.
[54:10.74]Christ, where's everybody?
[54:12.44]What happened here?
[54:13.84]Something.
[54:15.02]I don't know what they were.
[54:17.15]But they attacked us.
[54:19.09]I thought they was part of the...
[54:23.53]What a lie.
[54:23.93]That's a lie.
[54:24.49]Okay, what hap- what was- why did I just get like two different cutscenes?
[54:45.44]If you or a squad member is injured and no medic is available, you do have the ability to heal him on your own using medical kits.
[54:53.94]They'll indicate their need for help by showing the I need health icon over their head.
[54:58.84]When this is visible, you can automatically use a medical kit on the injured squad member by approaching him and pressing E. Alternatively, if you equip a medical kit, you can heal an NPC by approaching him.
[55:10.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:11.95]Just put it on your bar and mouse too.
[55:13.39]Who cares?
[55:14.41]I get it.
[55:19.69]To see how much health a squad member has at any time, activate the squad menu.
[55:23.13]At the bottom of this particular panel is a red meter.
[55:26.56]The fullness of it tells you how much health he has.
[55:29.04]It's also important to know that your squad members are in man-down state when they're knelt down and bleeding.
[55:33.92]Move quickly to heal them.
[55:35.42]When they're in this condition, they'll eventually bleed to death.
[55:39.03]Do I have any health packs?
[55:45.12]Okay.
[55:46.88]I do have health pack.
[55:48.78]Let's do it.
[55:49.18]If I want to just get this right, it says right mouse button.
[55:53.69]Carter isn't sure if he trusts you and he won't cooperate with you until he does.
[55:57.63]Try giving him a weapon and some ammunition to gain his trust.
[56:03.23]Go to the squad member menu by pressing Q and highlight Carter and then press enter.
[56:08.96]Now highlight the command give to squad member and move the... Okay.
[56:12.12]Okay.
[56:13.75]I know.
[56:14.95]You have now given Carter a weapon.
[56:16.39]Look at his trust meter to see if it is in the green.
[56:19.39]If not, let go of the mouse to... What?
[56:24.13]Hold on.
[56:27.62]I'm not going to read this out loud.
[56:31.54]Like, reading comprehension, if you just... You know there's a study that says if you read something out loud, you're not comprehending it completely?
[56:37.74]Have you ever heard that study?
[56:39.18]It's real.
[56:43.42]That's why when you go through around in your high school class and you all read six sentences of the fucking novel you're currently on, none of you understand what's going on.
[56:53.93]Okay, now it's Jim's turn.
[56:56.81]Reed's fucking like a half a page.
[56:58.98]Alright, now it's Carol's turn.
[57:00.98]None of you know what's going on in the story.
[57:07.62]You're anticipating wanting to read and hoping that the class ends before they get to you.
[57:15.00]I hated that more than anything.
[57:17.80]What a fucking... You're talking about stalling.
[57:21.93]That's like the ultimate in stalling.
[57:24.77]You know how long it takes for like 20 high school students to read three pages of a novel?
[57:31.29]Like fucking 40 minutes.
[57:35.22]Anyways, alright.
[57:35.84]I'll be right back.
[57:54.26]I don't have another weapon.
[57:56.53]Should I give him a fire extinguisher?
[58:01.45]Alright, I'm sorry.
[58:08.25]I was trying to give this to you.
[58:09.77]Apparently I didn't comprehend it.
[58:11.05]Okay, give... I don't have a weapon.
[58:17.76]I only have ammo.
[58:18.58]I don't have a weapon.
[58:22.07]How am I supposed, am I gonna give?
[58:24.55]I don't wanna give him all my ammo.
[58:35.69]Okay, you got enough.
[58:38.55]Okay, he has all the ammo now.
[58:40.19]Now I need that back actually.
[58:41.81]I hit enter and it gave him everything.
[58:44.70]Can I have that back please?
[58:46.38]I like emptied the clip.
[58:47.98]Here you go.
[58:49.60]If that's not trust, I don't know what is.
[58:56.34]Alright, please don't kill me.
[58:59.60]How do I... Where's my ammo?
[59:01.04]Pistol ammo.
[59:01.96]I need that back.
[59:02.54]Alright, take ammo.
[59:08.98]He doesn't trust me anymore.
[59:21.35]Okay, we're good.
[59:22.95]Let's go.
[59:24.73]Can I... Did I heal him?
[59:27.71]Yeah, he's alright.
[59:29.23]Alright, let's move.
[59:34.30]You gonna follow me?
[59:39.56]Okay.
[59:40.10]Let's go.
[59:43.86]A flashlight, thank god.
[59:46.71]Oh my god, this game just became 5,000 times easier.
[59:50.37]I can actually see what the hell I'm doing.
[59:56.27]Torch.
[59:59.29]oh thank god I'm so happy to have this right now let's move alright turn the power on anything with the computers these don't run on the batteries right junction box engineer go for it alright
[60:28.78]What's that beep?
[60:33.28]Closed circuit TVs are useful in gathering tools.
[60:35.84]You... Okay.
[60:48.37]We're all going crazy, this thing in the ice.
[60:50.53]Don't know who is human and who isn't.
[60:52.23]Morale is low and I don't think our chances are good.
[60:59.08]There's gotta be something in here that can help me.
[61:08.19]A face is gonna pop up.
[61:13.94]Oh, there it is.
[61:19.06]46892.
[61:20.08]Ice Block?
[61:22.06]Code?
[61:24.65]Is that it?
[61:31.00]And a guy in the corner with a key.
[61:35.25]Alright, I got the- I got it.
[61:39.13]Let's go.
[61:39.47]I didn't- Was that person here before?
[61:55.02]That's not even a jump scare!
[61:57.07]I just activated the jump scare on myself.
[62:07.18]I went in there fully ready.
[62:10.34]Okay, here we go.
[62:11.18]Uh oh.
[62:13.80]Where are they?
[62:14.86]Are they in the ice room or are they up here?
[62:18.48]Be ready!
[62:33.33]What are you doing in here?
[62:36.87]Alien.
[62:37.17]Kill this guy.
[62:37.79]Alien.
[62:37.99]Alien.
[63:06.09]Alien.
[63:06.21]Alien, I knew it.
[63:06.81]Gain access to north section.
[63:08.49]Okay.
[63:08.79]How's our trust doing?
[63:10.93]Don't make me regret this.
[63:12.23]Wait.
[63:12.47]No, I don't have anything to give you.
[63:37.44]I mean... No.
[63:42.06]Uh, there's a key on this guy.
[63:45.32]What is it for?
[63:46.44]Just a key.
[63:49.44]Just a key.
[63:54.50]Okay, there's a junction box down here for power, I think.
[63:57.39]Power grid controls.
[63:59.79]Can you handle this, please?
[64:02.47]You got it.
[64:03.17]Go for it.
[64:09.50]Now we go all the way back.
[64:14.62]I know.
[64:26.19]Where are the aliens that were up top though?
[64:33.42]I can't open that door.
[64:37.69]They were like Half-Life monsters in the rafters.
[64:44.72]Can I open this with the key?
[64:47.68]Somebody shoot somebody!
[64:56.89]Good work.
[65:00.23]Why are they so little?
[65:06.21]Shoot!
[65:08.21]Okay, this is what I would picture like if an AT-ST was a crab.
[65:14.95]This is what they would look like with the shell off.
[65:20.67]Alright, we're good.
[65:36.60]Can we please go?
[65:38.89]It's on hard mode.
[65:40.89]I should have known, seriously.
[65:41.87]Alright, we have medical stuff.
[65:47.21]Anybody need anything?
[65:48.01]Alright, let me heal.
[65:52.23]Can I heal you guys?
[65:53.05]What do you have for health?
[65:54.86]You could use a heal.
[65:56.66]Come here.
[65:57.18]Do you trust me?
[66:00.68]Hello?
[66:01.46]Was that you?
[66:05.65]Look, we all haven't eaten in like three days.
[66:08.57]I know.
[66:09.21]Trust me.
[66:09.55]I'm gonna try to find us some food, for God's sakes.
[66:18.46]Okay.
[66:19.30]You need to be healed.
[66:22.70]Is he good?
[66:24.02]Yeah.
[66:24.40]Alright.
[66:25.16]It's instant.
[66:26.89]I'm not gonna heal you.
[66:27.67]I don't trust you yet.
[66:29.09]I seriously don't.
[66:31.11]Alright, now let's go back to the flashlight.
[66:37.51]Do you wanna... Do you... I don't have a weapon.
[66:40.79]Why do you not have a weapon?
[66:45.53]No, give me that back.
[66:49.07]You know what?
[66:49.55]I'm just gonna... It's gonna be Pikmin.
[66:50.73]Let's go.
[66:52.44]Sir.
[67:03.56]Open the door.
[67:05.64]Alright, you open the door.
[67:08.33]Go to door.
[67:14.33]Ow!
[67:20.43]I knew it.
[67:21.08]He's trying to get rid of me.
[67:25.04]Open it.
[67:26.24]Open it!
[67:26.52]It's hard mode.
[67:31.74]I don't even need to fucking shoot a gun.
[67:33.20]This is gonna be great.
[67:34.03]Alright, where's my flashlight?
[67:44.90]I'll just aim the flashlight at stuff.
[67:51.60]Alright, fire extinguisher, I have a couple of those.
[68:05.62]That's not really how this works, but okay, I'll take it.
[68:11.90]Alright, let's go.
[68:17.68]You guys are the only two weapons.
[68:19.16]Please.
[68:22.75]Are you not coming because of this one fire right here?
[68:25.31]You motherfuckers, really?
[68:29.05]You can't step around this?
[68:33.93]There.
[68:34.25]There you go.
[68:46.74]We can now go this way.
[68:47.66]I'm looking for, like, a pistol.
[68:48.72]Alright, new area.
[68:52.96]Killing Thing Beasts.
[68:54.24]As you have already experienced, the very small Thing Beasts can easily be dealt with using normal weaponry.
[68:59.13]However, any other form of the Thing requires a two-stage attack.
[69:04.39]Firstly, you will need to use normal weapons to reduce its health.
[69:08.53]The Thing's health is shown by the color of the auto-aiming target, with red representing the lowest level of health.
[69:17.74]Once the Thingbeast is on minimal health, move in with a flamethrower to finish it off.
[69:23.10]Only fire can actually kill these Thingbeasts, so make sure to look out for incendiary weapons and keep a good stock on you at all times.
[69:37.08]Well, all I have is a flashlight.
[69:50.19]Weapon case.
[69:52.25]Something.
[70:00.83]There we go.
[70:02.35]Help!
[70:03.09]What are you doing?
[70:06.47]God damn it.
[70:14.68]Alright, I got a safe point.
[70:20.29]What's my view?
[70:21.15]You don't have any ammo?
[70:22.69]You need ammo.
[70:24.03]Here, take some.
[70:27.21]How much ammo do you have?
[70:27.93]1 out of 34.
[70:29.55]Alright.
[70:30.91]You guys are burning ammo.
[70:32.95]You guys are terrible at this game.
[70:37.42]Come on.
[70:39.48]I gotta be a better eSports coach.
[70:46.46]He doesn't have too much ammo.
[70:50.95]Fix this.
[71:00.82]Actually pretty good.
[71:03.74]Glancing over at chat.
[71:04.88]I look at chat like every 10 seconds.
[71:07.20]It's their first time.
[71:15.79]They usually play console.
[71:19.11]Oh.
[71:20.03]Ooh, what's that?
[71:21.34]Incendiary.
[71:23.28]I wish I could seriously just switch quickly instead of having to go to the fucking menu to do this.
[71:30.50]Alright, what is over here?
[71:32.28]What are these?
[71:32.62]Are these grenades?
[71:34.88]Weapon case.
[71:36.31]Oh yeah.
[71:37.21]I'll be the flamethrower guy.
[71:38.83]I just figured it out.
[71:41.31]I'm flamethrower guy.
[71:45.51]It's perfect.
[71:49.66]So is that ammo for the flamethrower?
[71:52.96]Oh yeah, absolutely.
[71:56.41]You guys attack, and then when it gets to be the time where I can burn it, I will burn it.
[72:03.03]Alright, let's go.
[72:08.30]Uh oh, here they come.
[72:11.50]Get them!
[72:19.21]I like being the overlord.
[72:20.51]I don't have any more ammo.
[72:22.84]Actually, I do.
[72:23.50]I'm the ammo box.
[72:29.38]Yes.
[72:29.90]If you need ammo, tell me.
[72:32.16]I'm playing support.
[72:34.02]Alright, so this is here, and then... What about over here?
[72:38.29]Can I get in this building?
[72:40.33]I don't think so.
[72:42.11]Hold on, get in here and recalibrate.
[72:48.10]Where's the save point?
[72:49.42]No, alright, just... It's my bar that matters, so... Do I go back here?
[72:54.52]No, alright, I can go this way.
[72:58.94]I'm gonna save it again.
[73:05.82]Got flamethrower thing left.
[73:07.30]Or I can go that way too.
[73:10.38]Let's go over here first.
[73:13.60]Area looks secure.
[73:17.68]Does it?
[73:21.42]Easy.
[73:22.62]Can I not turn that on?
[73:28.41]Can you fix this fuse thing?
[73:30.07]What's this electricity?
[73:33.85]Um, do I burn the boxes?
[73:48.73]How do we get over here?
[73:53.28]Wait, can I do like... You.
[73:56.88]Go to... Boxes.
[74:03.20]Maybe I just can't do anything.
[74:06.18]I don't know.
[74:10.65]Give me your gun for a second.
[74:12.87]I can't tell you to shoot that.
[74:14.39]I have to shoot the boxes.
[74:16.47]Oh, hold on.
[74:17.26]No, no, no.
[74:17.68]We gotta get... Back to the tent that's over here, whatever this was.
[74:24.02]I gotta get a gun.
[74:30.61]Come here.
[74:32.81]Okay, get in here.
[74:34.88]Give me one of your guns.
[74:35.90]Who likes me more?
[74:37.18]You both like me.
[74:37.88]A lot.
[74:38.32]So that's fine.
[74:38.90]Uh, you.
[74:41.78]Give me your gun.
[74:48.35]You'll get over it.
[74:48.95]Alright, let's go.
[74:50.43]That's all you need, right?
[75:04.57]Go for it.
[75:05.05]Okay, you can have this back.
[75:09.77]Here.
[75:09.99]There you go.
[75:18.94]Don't act like I never did anything for you.
[75:26.76]This game is cool.
[75:27.78]It is pretty cool.
[75:30.50]Alright, open.
[75:34.36]It's right in front of you.
[75:35.30]There's a door.
[75:36.70]Alright, this is where we actually figure out if we're capable of doing it like this.
[75:49.18]Save point right here.
[75:50.48]No, I can't even touch it.
[75:53.00]Hold it.
[75:55.13]Pierce, it's Blake.
[75:56.32]It's okay.
[75:57.06]Put your weapon down.
[75:58.22]No way.
[75:58.94]You're infected just like all the others.
[76:00.30]Well, you just killed all of us.
[76:01.16]I'm not.
[76:02.28]Your word ain't shit, Captain.
[76:04.10]I found a report that says the only way to prove you're not one of those things is through a blood test.
[76:09.49]Now, there's a medical kit near the kennel.
[76:11.29]You go get it and come back here, and I'll watch you do the test.
[76:16.31]Oh, just like in the movie.
[76:31.09]He shot!
[76:31.77]They shoot!
[76:35.41]They're shooting him!
[76:39.01]Well, turned out he wasn't the thing.
[76:41.09]Just needed to see.
[76:49.18]That's so funny.
[76:49.76]They're just like, nobody's even talking either.
[76:51.78]They're just like, I guess we're just gonna shoot them.
[76:56.08]I guess so.
[76:57.38]Alright, we have to go to the medical tent.
[76:59.28]Go get the blood test.
[77:02.60]These are grenades.
[77:04.88]Okay, anything else in here?
[77:05.70]Ooh, what's this?
[77:06.81]A key.
[77:10.35]That looks good.
[77:10.97]Save it one more time.
[77:14.99]No soft locking, right?
[77:16.47]Don't get soft locked.
[77:21.11]Alright, we need to go find the blood tests.
[77:24.57]In the medical tent.
[77:26.77]Which... I haven't gone this way.
[77:33.57]If you kill everybody, you're gonna kill the thing.
[77:37.11]Yeah, but if I kill everybody, then I lose.
[77:48.14]This is... I like this.
[77:49.91]It's working out pretty well so far.
[77:51.73]Oh!
[77:52.77]Easy.
[77:59.81]Was there a health pack?
[78:01.23]That's it?
[78:04.00]Well, I guess this is shelter, technically.
[78:05.58]Alright, let's go.
[78:08.14]Blood.
[78:08.50]Alright.
[78:11.24]We're looking for medical supplies.
[78:18.20]Something's gonna jump around a fucking corner.
[78:22.28]Come here.
[78:24.52]Go get it.
[78:28.86]Break the boxes.
[78:30.38]What the fuck just happened?
[78:31.38]He's puking!
[78:32.64]What?
[78:35.94]Shoot him!
[78:38.21]Oh no!
[78:48.52]Everybody alright?
[78:54.62]Come here, I can heal you.
[78:57.19]Uh, how many health packs do I have?
[79:03.31]So that came out of this guy's mouth.
[79:05.27]How are we all doing?
[79:06.77]Get in here.
[79:08.89]Open this.
[79:10.79]Everybody get in here.
[79:13.71]Two shotgun shells.
[79:17.39]Ammo.
[79:18.23]Give me pistol.
[79:20.70]Why is there no pistol here?
[79:23.78]Ammo-wise, though.
[79:25.78]How you doing?
[79:31.00]Give ammo.
[79:32.22]You've got two clips.
[79:35.84]So you've got two out of twenty.
[79:37.04]So then you have... You've only got five.
[79:42.55]You've got one clip left.
[79:43.43]Take this.
[79:46.05]Take them both.
[79:48.71]I think there's a little bit more over here too.
[79:50.77]Is there?
[79:53.72]I got so much pistol ammo.
[79:56.40]Alright, what about heal health?
[79:58.20]You could use a heal.
[79:58.98]Let me just equip it.
[80:04.90]Heal them both.
[80:09.03]We're good.
[80:10.95]That was fucked up.
[80:13.75]Back to the flashlight.
[80:14.75]Alright.
[80:15.95]Let's do it.
[80:25.21]Just stay here.
[80:29.24]Come on, you can do better than that.
[80:35.58]I just, like, went in the building.
[80:37.24]That's it.
[80:39.06]Good.
[80:39.95]Alright.
[80:40.85]Uh, this way.
[80:44.01]Nice.
[80:52.50]I just need- I want a pistol or something.
[80:54.08]Something small so I can contribute.
[81:09.06]Blood tests.
[81:12.27]The blood test hypo you recently picked up is specifically designed to expose the virus entity when it exists in a human host.
[81:19.47]You can use these to make sure a squad member is really human and also to prove to your squad that you're not infected to boost their trust.
[81:27.68]To use a blood test hypo on a squad member, simply equip it, then approach them and press mouse 2.
[81:34.26]Yeah, so you do that, and if they're an alien, then they freak out and they turn into an alien.
[81:38.52]Use on them, or we're about to.
[81:42.57]Uh, be tactical about using blood tests.
[81:46.03]They're a rare item and you won't find many.
[81:52.64]Yeah, so this is where it gets interesting.
[81:59.86]Nice job.
[82:00.34]You guys did it.
[82:00.82]Good work.
[82:02.32]This is how you really play the game on hard, don't you think?
[82:04.32]You guys are alright?
[82:07.12]Everyone's happy?
[82:10.70]But we need to open boxes.
[82:13.10]Alright, I've had... Give me your gun.
[82:17.64]I don't care anymore.
[82:18.30]Give me all of it.
[82:18.78]There's nothing even in here.
[82:33.76]What?
[82:35.94]Is this The Legend of Zelda shit, or is anything actually even in here?
[82:49.12]I need a place to go in right now.
[82:53.32]This is not... Am I just wasting ammo?
[82:57.35]I'm wasting ammo.
[82:58.33]There's never anything in these.
[82:59.51]No way.
[83:01.69]I've just proved it.
[83:05.21]It is a waste of ammo.
[83:05.95]Wasting ammo.
[83:06.55]Omega lull.
[83:07.82]Tactical.
[83:22.16]I don't have any ammo for you.
[83:23.30]Just make it last.
[83:26.99]Alright.
[83:27.49]I got three blood tests.
[83:28.99]We gotta go back.
[83:35.61]Where's the road?
[83:37.47]I already went up there, right?
[83:43.22]Yep.
[83:43.64]Okay.
[83:45.44]Get a fresh fill up.
[83:47.92]Alright.
[83:48.12]Let's go.
[83:54.92]And then it was over here.
[84:00.91]Alright.
[84:01.57]Here we go.
[84:02.05]Let's do the blood test.
[84:05.41]I'm gonna prove... Hi.
[84:07.65]Can you give me the finger?
[84:10.96]You got the kit?
[84:12.40]Good.
[84:13.46]The report said the hypo contains a chemical that reacts with blood.
[84:16.96]Do it.
[84:17.86]We'll soon know, one way or another.
[84:20.88]Now I'm gonna show you what I already know.
[84:26.85]Return blood test.
[84:27.97]Come on.
[84:35.31]Alright.
[84:36.09]He's real.
[84:40.35]No!
[84:40.61]He's... It's a... It's a... It's a thing.
[84:42.57]That's a thing!
[84:43.83]Kill him!
[84:49.36]I... Kill... Kill him!
[84:52.74]They were both things?! !
[84:56.31]What?
[84:58.59]Oh wait, wrong guy!
[85:03.71]Oh fuck!
[85:08.36]Kill him!
[85:08.88]I don't have any ammo left!
[85:19.92]Are you a thing?
[85:29.11]That's the image you see at the end when you lose a game in Left 4 Dead.
[85:34.49]You fall down and then your friend falls down right after.
[85:38.37]They were both things.
[85:39.63]I... Give me a break.
[85:46.84]They take a lot of damage.
[85:48.94]I have to... They have my weapons.
[85:56.28]Alright, I'm cheesing this.
[85:57.52]Give me my stuff back.
[85:59.78]You don't deserve it.
[86:05.08]Get out of here.
[86:06.86]Give me my stuff back.
[86:10.88]I don't give a shit.
[86:14.08]Oops.
[86:14.94]It takes up the whole thing.
[86:15.68]Alright, here we go.
[86:17.55]That's a save scum.
[86:20.09]What if I just... No, you can't.
[86:26.53]You have to prove it first.
[86:33.12]You have to prove it first.
[86:35.70]Alright, I'm ready.
[86:36.32]Let's go.
[86:36.68]God damn it.
[86:40.98]Alright, so shoot and then burn.
[86:43.63]This guy's flamethrower guy.
[86:44.51]Mm-hmm.
[86:44.95]Here we go.
[86:59.64]Take their guns.
[87:00.50]Their guns.
[87:02.87]And ammo.
[87:03.97]I think I... Wait, we didn't even test him!
[87:16.52]We didn't test him yet!
[87:20.22]Alright, let's go!
[87:32.17]Double it!
[87:32.81]Double it!
[87:33.17]Burn him!
[87:47.10]Alright, now burn him!
[87:56.21]Okay, we're good.
[88:00.07]Although, I have no ammo.
[88:02.23]So, I should have trusted you.
[88:04.43]I'm sorry.
[88:09.21]It was my fault.
[88:11.17]You're a good guy.
[88:14.11]Now what the hell do I do?
[88:16.81]I have to test you.
[88:17.81]Come here.
[88:20.42]Okay.
[88:33.21]Now where do I go?
[88:35.33]Shoot him.
[88:35.87]No.
[88:37.55]I'm saving a different slot just in case I softlock myself.
[88:40.81]In like 10 minutes.
[88:42.47]So we just leave?
[88:44.49]Oh, okay.

[89:13.72]Blake, is that you?

[89:16.98]He's throwing grenades at people?
[89:20.64]Psycho.
[89:21.80]Yeah, it's me, you jackass.
[89:24.15]Now let's get inside.
[89:27.80]I need to te- I gotta test this guy.
[89:28.82]Whoa, you're fuckin' pretty useless, buddy.
[89:29.92]And you've been wasting grenades just throwing them into the snow?
[90:02.28]Alright, grenades.
[90:03.58]I got like a key or something.
[90:06.13]Nice.
[90:06.81]That's... Oh, thank God.
[90:08.37]You have a gun, right?
[90:09.75]You got ammo for that gun?
[90:12.93]What do you got?
[90:13.35]What do you got for ammo?
[90:19.13]I'll give you a little bit of ammo.
[90:21.73]Give you a clip.
[90:24.71]That's all you get.
[90:25.35]Because I don't know if you're real or not.
[90:27.51]You could be fake.
[90:29.87]Alright, what have I got?
[90:30.53]Let me equip...
[90:33.75]Got ten regular grenades.
[90:37.03]Alright, just do not hit right mouse button.
[90:40.15]Can you get- can I take these?
[90:41.59]Can you take these too?
[90:46.77]Come on, maybe I can give him some grenades.
[90:50.90]Give... No, I can't.
[90:53.74]Give me that back.
[90:55.36]You can only give weapons.
[90:57.91]Actually, you probably should have a couple clips.
[91:00.91]I'm alright with that.
[91:02.93]Check yourself.
[91:03.51]I already did.
[91:03.95]Alright, let's go.
[91:11.77]So now we have to go find the Alpha Team.
[91:16.14]Do you like me?
[91:16.96]Yeah, you really like me, I guess.
[91:20.56]Alright, over here.
[91:31.11]Are you an engineer?
[91:31.69]What are you, a soldier engineer?
[91:33.09]This ain't gonna open.
[91:35.79]Uh, where's the box?
[91:36.43]There it is.
[91:40.09]I can do this one.
[91:42.07]Shoot him!
[91:42.53]Alright.
[91:48.37]You just showed that you're actually, you're worth keeping around.
[91:51.40]Nice work.
[91:58.04]I want a light.
[91:59.06]I hate not having the lamp.
[92:05.97]Aim over there.
[92:06.71]I need a pistol.
[92:13.62]Christ.
[92:14.14]Okay.
[92:17.12]No, we're not.
[92:27.09]I got a radio for assistance.
[92:33.99]They're like zigzagging.
[92:37.95]What's wrong?
[92:38.27]What's that mean?
[92:39.31]What's the matter?
[92:39.75]What's wrong?
[92:40.03]What's wrong?
[92:40.31]What's the matter?
[92:45.73]You alright?
[92:50.30]Alright, you're okay.
[92:53.38]Are you good?
[92:54.66]Yeah.
[92:55.12]Oh, you are an engineer.
[92:57.76]Oh, they're coming out of the box.
[92:59.28]Can you take care of that?
[93:01.50]Actually, no.
[93:01.88]You go to the box.
[93:03.18]I'll take care of this.
[93:03.78]Okay.
[93:20.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[93:21.31]What's over here?
[93:24.17]Can't open this.
[93:26.85]Shoot him.
[93:27.73]We always do.
[93:33.21]I need a save point.
[93:34.11]I don't feel safe right now.
[93:42.79]Protect me.
[93:44.13]Lost contact with the Medi Center today.
[93:45.97]We sent a team up to investigate, but then lost contact with them in the storm.
[93:49.86]They were due to check in over five hours ago, but there is no way I'm going to send anyone else out there in this weather.
[93:56.10]Medi... The Medi Center.
[93:59.70]One of these guys is going to stand up.
[94:02.71]Is this a cafeteria?
[94:03.86]Oh.
[94:07.98]Stay the hell away from me!
[94:09.02]I'm warning you!
[94:11.24]Williams, I need your help.
[94:13.90]Bullshit you're infected just like the rest come any closer and I'll fry your ass Listen, I found pace.
[94:20.88]I just need to get into the comm room to call for assistance.
[94:24.57]Do you have access?
[94:26.49]Who is the alien this time?
[94:28.33]I ain't going nowhere with all those things out there you kill them and I'll help get us out of here Okay Kill all walkers
[94:42.69]Alright, but do you have anything back here that I can use?
[94:44.31]I don't know.
[94:47.61]We'll find out.
[94:53.52]Kill all the walkers.
[94:57.18]Computer there.
[94:58.04]Alright.
[94:59.42]Walker.
[95:01.58]Yeah.
[95:08.10]Nice.
[95:08.76]One more?
[95:11.89]Where's the last one?
[95:15.09]In the oven or something.
[95:17.37]Don't attempt to take on any self-repairing alien entity without the ability to cook them.
[95:22.81]Flame weaponry is the only way to kill large enemies.
[95:25.60]When attacking your target, be sure to administer enough fuel to ignite them, but be aware that the environment and squad members could become part of the barbecue.
[95:33.84]We learned that one the hard way.
[95:36.00]The flamethrower can also be used to lay down fire walls.
[95:39.84]that can be used to pen enemy targets.
[95:43.70]What?
[95:49.37]What do you mean?
[95:51.65]Wait, there's a... I have two flamethrowers?
[95:57.68]Oh shit, there's a mini flamethrower and then a big flamethrower.
[96:03.40]Nice, nice job.
[96:04.98]Thank you.
[96:11.25]Oh, I got one.
[96:13.27]Alright, do I stick him with this?
[96:17.07]Or do I save it?
[96:20.01]Should we just find out right now?
[96:24.67]Or wait until he shows symptoms?
[96:28.55]Which is the backup in case of a softlock?
[96:30.51]I don't remember.
[96:31.90]Alright, we killed all the walkers for you.
[96:40.35]Or crawlers is what they should have been called.
[96:42.97]Those weren't walkers.
[96:43.79]Alright, this is... Oh, shit.
[96:52.23]Is that fuel?
[96:54.49]Full fuel.
[96:55.19]And there's still fuel in there, so let's go.
[96:57.17]Is it not open?
[97:01.24]Oh, come on.
[97:01.70]What?
[97:05.30]Shit.
[97:07.98]Oh.
[97:11.93]Oh.
[97:12.37]My.
[97:12.69]God.
[97:13.54]Okay.
[97:14.00]Well.
[97:15.10]Duh.
[97:16.40]Yeah, we do.
[97:18.06]And you're gonna fight whether you want to or not.
[97:20.10]Kill it!
[97:43.28]You can do it.
[97:44.96]This guy is infected 100%.
[97:45.98]Do you think so?
[97:47.86]You want ammo?
[97:48.50]You're not getting anything.
[97:50.16]You good?
[97:53.36]Not really.
[97:59.48]Those things are huge too.
[98:10.51]They do puke.
[98:15.02]Okay, so they... Uh oh!
[98:30.45]Wait, are you gonna die?
[98:31.11]Oh!
[98:36.89]Run!
[98:37.27]Run!
[98:38.85]Run!
[98:42.71]Run away!
[98:43.03]Run away!
[98:43.41]Get away!
[98:43.75]Get away!
[98:46.78]Got it.
[98:49.20]God, I wish they, like, dropped me.
[98:55.53]Where are they?
[98:58.49]Ceiling?
[99:03.79]You gotta get healed.
[99:04.43]I have to heal you.

[99:08.77]Oh, shit, you are.
[99:10.69]Here, take a clip, and then let me heal you.
[99:16.71]No, it's over here.
[99:18.93]I got a full inventory.
[99:21.04]Alright, you're good.
[99:25.98]There's one more of those things.
[99:32.52]They're huge.
[99:34.00]You got a clip.
[99:34.60]You can do it.
[99:36.40]Going all the way across.
[99:37.12]Where's the last one?
[99:37.82]Alright, I have two.
[99:45.07]Where is it?
[99:47.57]I hate that they can come from behind too.
[99:48.93]Oh shit!
[100:05.42]Where is it?
[100:10.56]Shoot, kill it!
[100:14.28]Kill!
[100:19.58]No, we're not.
[100:20.06]It's dead.
[100:20.50]Got it.
[100:24.63]You're good.
[100:28.83]Alright.
[100:32.57]Aye!
[100:36.00]What the fuck, man?
[100:42.26]I can't tolerate that shit.
[100:52.09]Didn't I didn't get a key?
[100:54.91]I thought I got a key for that door.
[100:59.99]No, we gotta go this way.
[101:08.22]Alright, stop.
[101:09.20]I'm trying to remember where we went the first time.
[101:12.32]Where was he?
[101:13.76]Oh shit.
[101:16.62]I'll take some ammo.
[101:17.42]Here, take this.
[101:20.16]Oh man, that's a lot of... that's a lot.
[101:21.60]Come here.
[101:27.46]Take... no.
[101:29.08]What if it's you?
[101:29.76]What if you're the bad guy?
[101:30.60]Alright, actually that was worth doing.
[101:37.21]Just... come over here.
[101:39.91]He's infected.
[101:42.57]He's not infected.
[101:46.79]He's fine.
[101:52.88]I have two provers.
[101:53.96]Alright, we're good.
[101:54.72]Hold on.
[101:55.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[101:56.74]What are you doing?
[101:57.66]What?
[101:57.82]Oh, no, wait.
[101:58.64]Wait, we have to follow him.
[102:02.90]You're going to be flamethrower guy?
[102:04.93]Alright, we have to...
[102:22.56]Alright, relax.
[102:31.72]Okay, everyone's fine.
[102:39.28]Follow me, I have a plan.
[102:40.46]We're all gonna die in here.
[102:41.78]Alright, uh, I need an engineer.
[102:46.76]Test them.
[102:51.76]We will.
[102:52.72]We will.
[102:53.08]Don't worry.
[103:02.19]Come here.
[103:05.09]Oh, but is it bad that I don't want to know because these guys have weapons and they can shoot stuff in the meantime?
[103:25.87]Take their guns, then test.
[103:31.39]Didn't I get two of these?
[103:33.91]Test yourself on webcam or I'm leaving.
[103:43.33]No, I don't want to know.
[103:44.93]Not yet.
[103:45.35]It's not important yet.
[103:49.00]You want me to do that now?
[103:49.88]What if this room just fucking erupted?
[103:56.05]Holy shit!
[104:01.43]Wait, make a firewall.
[104:04.10]That didn't work.
[104:06.64]Shoot!
[104:06.98]Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire!
[104:09.60]I'm getting out of here!
[104:10.70]I'm getting out of here!
[104:13.18]Wait, what about... It's fucking hectic, man.
[104:21.92]Okay.
[104:23.90]It gets loud and scary.
[104:27.34]Wait, don't go out yet.
[104:28.16]How's everybody on health?
[104:32.20]Uh-oh, he's about to crack.
[104:35.20]What do I do?
[104:37.02]Give him weapons, right?
[104:38.66]He needs ammo.
[104:40.75]Everyone get over here.
[104:44.25]Come here, come here, come here.
[104:46.93]Stop.
[104:49.33]Why did you just do that?
[104:50.77]Yes, sir.
[104:52.67]Oh shit, he's like going crazy.
[104:55.87]Stop doing this.
[104:59.37]Alright, how do I get morale?
[105:01.51]What do I do?
[105:04.85]No, they're both... You just fucking psyched each other out.
[105:08.77]Alright, what do I do?
[105:12.13]Stay.
[105:13.66]Can I give you something that you like?
[105:18.22]We have to get you out of this room.
[105:19.64]And that's the problem.
[105:20.20]Alright, I need to use the comms.
[105:23.82]Wait, health.
[105:30.00]Ooh.
[105:31.98]Stop.
[105:32.82]Everyone's fine.
[105:33.56]Alright, now what do I have to go?
[105:34.49]We have to get out of the room.
[105:38.51]Alright, now... Test.
[105:40.79]Alright, let's do it.
[105:54.57]He's real.
[105:55.18]He's legit.
[106:22.78]That was, holy shit, that was fucking ridiculous.
[106:28.07]Where'd he go?
[106:28.49]Is he gone?
[106:29.99]Why is he gone?
[106:32.75]Wait.
[106:34.13]He's not here anymore.
[106:36.81]Why is it saving from what just... Wait, what?
[106:41.92]Why is he running away?
[106:43.04]Oh, man, we're gonna die here.
[106:53.12]What?
[106:55.38]Hold on, is he the thing?
[106:56.86]No, why is it remembering my save?
[106:59.32]Oh, no, you're alright.
[107:09.04]We're good.
[107:13.20]Why are you running?
[107:19.05]This music.
[107:21.69]Here, take some of that.
[107:23.21]You good?
[107:23.51]Alright, you're okay now.
[107:26.89]You need some healing, though.
[107:27.76]Heal yourself!
[107:29.28]Don't you have- you have a medic.
[107:31.18]Here.
[107:33.18]For god's sake.
[107:36.56]What's this?
[107:37.70]Machine gun.
[107:41.69]Somebody wanna get that gun?
[107:45.61]Nobody needs this gun.
[107:48.75]That's- I'm surprised nobody needs this.
[107:52.36]No ammo in there either?
[107:55.26]Alright, so.
[107:57.34]We've got... There's a shotgun in here.
[108:00.82]Uh, yep.
[108:03.14]Oops.
[108:03.75]I just wasted a clip.
[108:08.69]What was that?
[108:12.45]Everybody, get in here.
[108:15.54]What?
[108:16.00]He keeps trying to leave.
[108:19.38]What did he just do?
[108:22.41]You just wasted a medpack.
[108:27.39]Alright, follow me.
[108:29.95]Okay, shotgun.
[108:37.05]Oh, we're gonna spread this ammo out.

[108:51.79]I've got a ton of ammo.
[108:55.23]No, no, no.
[108:55.61]You don't have any of the gun.
[108:57.69]You keep the flamethrower.
[108:58.73]That's a good idea.
[109:00.69]I like that idea.
[109:02.91]Now you take some of this ammo.
[109:07.27]In fact, take most of it.
[109:09.91]Yeah, max.
[109:11.89]I have a shotgun now.
[109:13.45]Yes, sir.

[111:00.87]Oh yeah, I do have grenades.
[111:03.05]You're right.
[111:03.47]I don't really like the shotgun, it's weird.
[111:08.59]It's too hard to use.
[111:10.09]No, they're not freaking out.
[111:11.95]Alright, ready, now I can go out this way.
[111:16.64]And then through here?

[113:04.81]Why are there so many?
[113:05.59]It's just waves of enemies.
[113:18.56]Can we leave?
[113:26.18]Alright, did I get everything in here?

[124:47.54]Give him a hug.
[124:48.73]You can't.
[124:52.65]Well, you're about to not be.
[124:54.07]How are you still alive in here?
[124:59.51]Yes, we do.
[125:01.33]Can you get him?
[125:03.99]How you doing?
[125:04.33]You alright?
[125:10.95]He's running.
[125:13.49]Running.
[125:16.67]Get him.
[125:17.07]Nice.
[125:17.89]Alright, good job.
[125:21.53]You take the little ones.
[125:22.77]I can do the big ones.
[125:23.57]For the love of God.
[125:28.44]What's in here?
[125:29.41]Weapon?
[125:30.63]No, it's a key.
[125:35.57]Key to what?
[125:39.37]Useful NPC.
[125:40.29]Yeah.
[125:41.72]Finally.
[125:42.58]I feel bad for, you know, testing him.
[125:47.76]What's that a key to, though?
[125:51.84]Key to, like, that warehouse that I need to go into?
[125:53.67]Where is it?
[125:54.07]Where is it?
[125:54.51]Over here?
[125:57.32]There's this building.
[125:57.96]There's a building over here, too.
[126:03.30]Can I go in this, like, shed?
[126:04.36]I mean, I'm gonna do it because people will scream if I don't.
[126:09.10]Nope.
[126:20.18]You're very obviously the thing, right?
[126:22.24]Like, you have to be.
[126:24.53]Gain access to the weather station.
[126:25.97]Just did.
[126:29.32]I need a save point.
[126:31.40]So badly.
[126:35.90]How much ammo does he have?
[126:42.12]Hopefully enough.
[126:44.22]Wait, lockers.
[126:47.52]Okay, incoming jump scare.
[126:50.06]I'm just waiting for it.
[126:58.97]Okay.
[127:02.61]Ooh, a tester.
[127:08.14]Wow, surprising.
[127:09.50]Alright, how many- I have two blood test kits.
[127:15.63]That's pretty good.
[127:20.33]That means I can use it once.
[127:29.59]Pretty reliable.
[127:31.77]I don't want this guy to die.
[127:32.51]You know what I mean?
[127:38.86]I want to keep this guy around.
[127:45.56]What's his name?
[127:46.16]What's his name?
[127:46.78]Pace.
[127:47.98]I didn't even know this person's name.
[127:50.49]But we are good fucking friends.
[127:52.87]Okay, big guy.
[127:53.87]Where...
[128:08.24]We were just... Ah!
[128:24.23]Burn!
[128:37.95]I tested him like 45 minutes ago.
[128:40.35]I tested that guy like an hour ago.
[128:45.09]What happened?
[128:47.05]Did he get scooped up somewhere?
[128:51.31]I lost sight of him.
[128:53.49]He got infected.
[128:58.99]Is it really just me?
[129:02.86]When I was in the vent.
[129:06.52]Oh, right.
[129:09.37]God damn it.
[129:10.19]Really?
[129:11.07]When I was in the vent?
[129:13.91]What do I have for health right now?
[129:17.03]I don't have any friends.
[129:20.14]And I have to fight a huge guy?
[129:21.32]Oh, fuck.
[129:25.32]I don't... Fuck you.
[129:43.28]Die.
[129:44.04]Die, burn.
[129:45.22]What is going on?
[129:46.02]Why is he... I don't have any friends.
[129:54.48]I am friendless.
[129:56.88]I don't feel safe at all.
[129:58.22]I feel horrible.
[129:59.52]I don't like playing the game by myself.
[130:01.06]I like playing the game with friends that can shoot.
[130:13.68]I gotta go up.
[130:15.88]But this... Pistol.
[130:20.87]Finally.
[130:28.31]No, now it feels like a horror game.
[130:35.09]Wait, it's spreading!
[130:36.63]It's spreading.
[130:53.51]I don't have any friends anymore!
[130:58.59]I need to heal.
[130:59.19]Okay.
[131:21.31]I may have been able to keep those guys around, too.
[131:23.36]That's what sucks.
[131:24.84]What is that?
[131:28.96]If I had been testing people... I have four testers!
[131:36.20]I could have been testing people and keeping them alive!
[131:39.18]Fuck, whatever.
[131:45.34]I'm hoarding my testers.
[131:54.10]Two people dead out there?
[131:55.07]Alright, I'm going up.
[132:10.68]Ah!
[132:11.20]Okay.
[132:14.90]I hear somebody.
[132:18.33]Computer.
[132:21.45]Gen Inc.
[132:21.93]personnel were here today.
[132:23.75]Again, they appear to be working on something under the ground.
[132:27.17]I've seen a lot of their equipment arriving, but I'm not sure where it is being kept.
[132:31.62]Underground.
[132:34.66]Right?
[132:41.46]This shit is locked now?
[132:42.94]Really?
[132:43.80]Come on.
[132:46.04]That's where he went.
[132:51.31]Did I miss something over here?
[132:54.53]Yeah.
[133:10.52]I'm sorry.
[133:11.00]I'm sorry to intrude.
[133:33.46]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[133:39.08]Burn.
[133:41.03]Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn.
[133:42.59]I need more burn.
[133:46.03]Ah.
[133:53.76]Okay.
[133:54.86]What was in the bathroom?
[133:55.68]Please be a key.
[133:56.36]Imagine if I just walked over here.
[134:05.01]Why is this happening?
[134:12.99]Oh, there's a head there.
[134:19.30]That's another tester.
[134:25.38]There's nothing here.
[134:29.33]There's like spinners.
[134:41.88]Get off that table.
[134:45.90]Get out of here.
[134:49.66]But where's the key?
[134:54.52]What the fuck?
[134:56.80]How are you... still alive?
[135:01.60]Key, key, key, key!
[135:05.61]There's a key in kitchen.
[135:06.95]Key in kitchen.
[135:07.75]I'm almost out of butane, whatever this thing uses.
[135:17.34]Key in kitchen, key in kitchen.
[135:22.25]Where's the kitchen?
[135:23.53]I don't know where the kitchen is.
[135:25.35]Have I been in the kitchen?
[135:27.03]Where's the kitchen?
[135:28.23]The kitchen upstairs?
[135:33.58]Key in kitchen.
[135:46.18]Where are key?
[135:51.51]Alright.
[136:02.32]I got it.
[136:02.62]Okay.
[136:09.37]Who are you and why are you running away?
[136:12.07]Wait.
[136:22.83]I'm not going anywhere.
[136:24.25]It's over.
[136:24.67]Oh, this is the flamethrower guy.
[136:27.39]I can feel it.
[136:29.03]I can get you help.
[136:30.35]You know goddamn well there's only one option here.
[136:33.28]No.
[136:34.62]No, I can't do that.
[136:35.74]You don't have a choice.
[136:37.16]Look, I won't let you die, asshole.
[136:39.20]Come on.
[136:40.20]Can't handle it.
[136:40.96]What do we do?
[136:46.10]Keep him around?
[136:46.50]This is crazy.
[136:47.68]Like my dad always said, if you want a job done right...
[136:52.79]You gotta do it yourself.
[137:12.02]Oh.
[137:13.16]Negative.
[137:15.24]Turns out it was just gas.
[137:20.51]What is this?
[137:26.81]It's a sniper rifle?
[137:29.77]That's pretty cool.
[137:30.45]Let me see what it looks like.
[137:31.49]How do I aim it?
[137:32.03]Do I have to... I don't want to click, because if I click, it might shoot.
[137:38.80]There's sniper ammo downstairs, too.
[137:40.16]What else do you have in your hand?
[137:49.37]Holding a sniper rifle like this is just wrong.
[137:53.33]I positioned the telescope on a large object in the ground.
[137:56.06]There's some activity and I saw people transporting equipment and containers to the site.
[137:59.94]Okay.
[138:07.78]So this is where the UFO is.
[138:22.09]What's that?
[138:26.84]Anybody notice anything?
[138:32.14]I don't see anything out of the ordinary besides a giant.
[138:34.36]I mean, it's a flying saucer.
[138:45.97]Should I move the telescope?
[139:10.96]interact quick equip toggle free look left shift left shift there it is hold on a minute I this is a first person mode
[139:49.64]Die!
[139:50.60]You dead?
[139:54.84]Oh, you have to stand still to use it.
[140:00.10]But that's how you do the sniper.
[140:01.18]But how do you zoom?
[140:01.98]Ooh, that's how.
[140:04.70]Okay.
[140:07.28]I need a save point.
[140:14.18]Is there anything else down here that I can do?
[140:15.76]I guess I could go in here.
[140:19.82]Dog food?
[140:24.63]Alright.
[140:25.35]You can do... Why did that guy have to do that?
[140:29.99]You could have been my friend and you could have helped me.
[140:32.75]I could have tested you.
[140:33.76]We could have been sure.
[140:42.42]Is it sniper ammo?
[140:43.78]I think this is a box of sniper ammo.
[140:46.42]Let's test out the sniper rifle.
[141:01.85]Okay.
[141:07.11]That's not sniper ammo.
[141:09.45]What is this thing?
[141:19.74]How is that not snipering?
[141:23.08]I just... Really?
[141:24.86]Fuck.
[141:32.23]That sucks.
[141:33.01]I just wasted a whole entire clip.
[141:35.97]I had four, didn't I?
[141:36.75]Alright, well, hold on a minute here.
[141:38.51]Get this out of the way.
[141:40.71]I can go this way.
[141:41.33]Just don't fall off.
[141:52.50]There's shit down there, though.
[141:55.84]Should I go down there?
[142:11.61]I'm almost dead.
[142:14.81]I'm cold, too.
[142:15.46]Oh, shit.
[142:16.44]Hold on.
[142:16.80]I have to get inside.
[142:23.99]I have to get inside, inside, inside.
[142:28.98]Oh, come on.
[142:29.70]Is there a door?
[142:34.92]Up.
[142:37.80]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[142:38.96]Get in.
[142:40.15]Get in there.
[142:40.53]Get in.
[142:40.77]Get in.
[142:44.17]I'm in.
[142:53.71]Unnecessary.
[142:55.25]New enemy type.
[143:01.99]And I don't have... Hold on.
[143:18.82]Uh oh.
[143:20.26]Don't use this.
[143:21.50]I have to use this.
[143:26.96]What is he doing?
[143:29.02]What are you doing?
[143:29.72]What are you doing?
[143:34.42]Burn!
[143:34.84]This guy sucks.
[143:46.82]Shoot him then!
[143:52.08]I need my- Where's my- Good.
[144:07.08]Jesus.
[144:08.26]That guy has so much health.
[144:14.27]Ah, the noises.
[144:15.25]I don't like the noises.
[144:16.75]Okay.
[144:19.21]Okay, you can open the door now.
[144:29.91]What is this movement?
[144:38.20]I'm sticking this guy immediately.
[144:40.00]Blake, you scared the shit out of me.
[144:42.58]What are you doing here?
[144:44.30]Let's skip the song and dance.
[144:46.22]Pierce is dead.
[144:47.06]New friend.
[144:47.52]I just want to get the hell out of here.
[144:48.78]Thank God.
[144:49.30]I followed some guy in here thinking it was him.
[144:51.73]Then I got trapped in here by those things.
[144:54.23]Was the guy from your team?
[144:57.17]No.
[144:58.79]I yelled at him a bunch of times.
[145:00.03]He didn't even look back.
[145:01.69]Could be the guy I was tailing.
[145:03.41]Any idea where he went?
[145:04.77]I think he's downstairs somewhere.
[145:06.21]I'm so lost.
[145:06.89]Okay, let's track him down and then see if we can get Whitley on the radio to chopper us out of here.
[145:11.19]Alright, don't let this guy to my sight.
[145:13.23]I'm gonna stick him right now.
[145:17.25]We need to be certain.
[145:17.95]I have plenty of them.
[145:20.11]I don't want this person to fall.
[145:21.15]Look at this.
[145:21.51]I got so many of these.
[145:24.13]Are you immediately going to make me sad?
[145:29.51]Is there a save point in here?
[145:32.85]There isn't.
[145:34.73]Is he safe?
[146:05.25]We're good!
[146:10.35]How do you feel?
[146:12.89]He is not infected.
[146:17.99]Controls for operating the crane are situated at the bottom of the stairs.
[146:23.13]Ensure power supply is on before operating as this may seize the mechanism.
[146:27.59]Next service is due in four months.
[146:29.67]Ensure power supply is on before you operate.
[146:32.49]So, bottom of the stairs.
[146:34.05]Operate.
[146:36.09]Thank you, by the way.
[146:37.89]How am I doing on health?
[146:43.48]Not good.
[146:45.52]I don't think.
[146:46.82]Let's use another.
[146:47.82]There we are.
[146:48.56]Okay.
[146:49.62]No sudden movements.
[146:50.42]No bullshit.
[146:51.86]You don't have a gun?
[146:52.56]I will give you one.
[146:55.10]Because I know that you are for real.
[146:58.20]Let's give you something.
[147:00.18]Sniper rifle.
[147:03.62]Now, why would I do that?
[147:04.74]He's gonna shoot it at stuff on the ground.
[147:07.25]Pistol.
[147:09.39]Shotgun.
[147:12.33]Shotgun.
[147:12.57]I don't like the shotgun.
[147:18.27]Pretty good timing.
[147:19.02]Pretty good timing.
[147:20.52]It was 1 minute and 12 seconds first lap.
[147:23.44]See you again in a minute and 15 seconds.
[147:27.69]I'm going to give him the shotgun.
[147:32.09]I really don't like the shotgun.
[147:33.37]I think it sucks.
[147:37.60]It's weird.
[147:38.18]It's too awkward.
[147:39.08]I like this one.
[147:40.34]I need butane.
[147:45.26]I will be the flamethrower guy.
[147:48.24]We're buddies.
[147:49.62]That's a weapon.
[147:53.52]Hope you can handle it.
[147:57.82]Let's go.
[148:00.22]I'm not going to let you go out of my sight.
[148:06.62]Flashlight.
[148:10.88]He's already out of my sight.
[148:11.72]He could be infected.
[148:16.80]I'm so paranoid about this now.
[148:19.75]All of my friends have been infected.
[148:30.70]What?
[148:32.46]What, did you see something?
[148:37.36]Where?
[148:40.16]Wait, wait, wait.
[148:40.60]Follow me, follow me, follow me.
[148:42.00]Over here, over here.
[148:43.40]Over here, over here, over here, over here, over here, over here.
[148:45.24]There's so many of them.
[148:46.56]What are you doing?
[148:47.96]Okay.
[148:50.13]I think I did something okay.
[148:51.27]Did I do something good?
[148:51.97]I don't know.
[148:53.29]Where's my friend?
[148:57.89]Stop.
[148:58.19]We're fine.
[149:05.39]He shot me in the back of the head with a shotgun!
[149:09.91]Start running!
[149:10.69]What are you standing there for?
[149:12.01]Oh, God.
[149:26.86]Shoot him!
[149:28.40]Shoot him!
[149:29.75]Shoot him with your shotgun!
[149:31.43]Shoot him!
[149:32.65]You fucking idiot!
[149:36.23]Ow.
[149:43.19]What are you doing?
[149:51.04]Thank you.
[150:00.90]He's been hit more than once.
[150:01.92]The chance of being infected is 80%.
[150:03.14]No, it is not.
[150:07.49]He is not 80% chance infected.
[150:13.25]I don't buy that.
[150:14.91]I don't buy that.
[150:15.51]That's not real.
[150:18.05]I need to heal, though.
[150:18.77]How you doing?
[150:22.31]I'll heal you, too.
[150:25.73]Fuck, I accidentally pressed... No, it's okay.
[150:27.34]I still need to...
[150:31.06]you're welcome let's get some weapons go shotgun test him test him test him he's not test him he's infected but we know he's not he's not infected give me the shotgun okay but he's not infected
[151:04.39]Thanks, guys.
[151:10.83]I'm not listening.
[151:12.10]I'm not listening to you guys for the next 40 minutes.
[151:17.42]He's fucking infected.
[151:19.16]Test him.
[151:20.00]I have to test him after every single fight?
[151:24.26]No.
[151:24.82]I ain't doing that.
[151:35.19]Okay, we're good.
[151:36.11]What a waste.
[151:40.37]Don't do it to yourself.
[151:42.11]Get this off.
[151:43.69]My flashlight back.
[151:44.59]I still have, like, these flame grenades.
[151:48.19]Alright, I'm gonna use those grenades at the next encounter, because I'm running out of butane.
[151:55.16]Yeah, I don't have any more butane.
[152:02.94]Alright, we got some random shit on the ground over here.
[152:08.00]What about inside the cra- yep.
[152:10.18]There is a bunch of useless shit that I don't need.
[152:14.16]Great.
[152:14.44]That's fantastic.
[152:16.04]Uh, reminder to weather station personnel, key cards can be obtained from the foreman in the office.
[152:26.13]Time to go to the office.
[152:37.38]Wherever that is.
[152:40.50]Oh, come on.
[152:49.66]So what?
[152:50.10]Now I gotta go back up here?
[152:52.52]Form it in the office.
[152:56.35]This building over this way.
[152:57.31]Because I came from here.
[153:00.49]So... Wait, what's this on the side?
[153:04.53]Alright, fix it.
[153:06.94]Are you an engineer?
[153:08.60]Oh, I'm an engineer.
[153:09.28]I can do it.
[153:12.87]Finally, light.
[153:18.95]Wish I did that earlier.
[153:23.07]Oh, come on.
[153:24.15]What?
[153:30.21]So, what the fuck?
[153:33.19]Is every door locked?
[153:46.04]Did I turn the power on?
[153:47.86]Can I move the crane?
[153:50.36]Because of the power?
[153:53.38]I can't do this or touch this or anything, can I?
[154:00.66]Climb the pipe.
[154:01.81]I don't think I can do that.
[154:05.89]Can I?
[154:07.51]Maybe I can.
[154:10.55]Hold on.
[154:14.11]I have to test him again.
[154:17.15]No, he's good.
[154:19.94]I guess I do have to do that.
[154:24.42]Oh, shit.
[154:25.02]Wow.
[154:25.42]Okay.
[154:27.38]Let's go.
[154:30.48]Can you make it up this?
[154:41.96]He's not going to come up here, right?
[154:43.86]No, he's too stupid.
[154:45.18]Alright, give me my machine gun.
[154:46.40]I'm looking for a key or a way to go down an office or a box.
[154:52.23]I'll take a box over here.
[154:56.27]What is this?
[154:59.23]It's just ammo.
[155:04.34]Secret?
[155:06.18]It doesn't look like it.
[155:07.74]I guess if you want to call that a secret, you can.
[155:11.77]That's bad.
[155:27.13]I looked over here at chat.
[155:29.33]Somebody said secret.
[155:30.25]I'm like, no, secret.
[155:36.92]Where does that start me?
[155:38.70]If I restart level.
[155:46.24]Alright, that's fine.
[155:47.68]That's not bad.
[155:48.24]Yeah, this is alright.
[155:54.85]Yeah, this is fine.
[155:58.93]It's literally right here.
[156:07.11]I'm right here, don't worry.
[156:24.86]Ew.
[156:25.44]The same exact thing just played out.
[156:28.04]You just re- you just rewound the game.
[156:32.09]What is going on?
[156:32.89]Burn!
[156:34.87]You just rewound the video by like fucking ten minutes.
[156:53.10]Okay.
[156:55.54]Get in here.
[156:56.51]Who are you?
[157:00.43]We're good.
[157:02.99]Tap on the computer.
[157:04.33]Yes.
[157:05.45]Fun.
[157:06.99]Fill up my sack.
[157:10.25]You're good.
[157:11.03]I gave you the shotgun.
[157:12.17]You can have it again.
[157:13.03]I know you're not infected.
[157:17.62]Take the shotgun and all the remaining clips inside.
[157:22.09]Good luck.
[157:23.41]I will be flame guy.
[157:25.09]Okay.
[157:26.05]Good.
[157:28.89]Where's my little torch?
[157:31.51]Good.
[157:33.38]Put the lights on.
[157:34.42]Alright.
[157:34.68]Yep.
[157:35.24]Put on the lights.
[157:35.98]We have a second chance here.
[157:50.40]Cool.
[157:56.03]Alright, you coming?
[157:57.58]Follow me.
[157:59.04]Yes, sir.
[158:03.22]He's double dead.
[158:05.68]He's double dead.
[158:10.13]Maybe I should have you stay up here.
[158:13.05]And shoot from below.
[158:26.69]Okay.
[158:29.10]What the fuck?
[158:29.92]Are we getting burned?
[158:31.30]I'm not going to pretend like I know.
[158:33.92]Let's do it.
[158:34.36]Bring it on.
[158:45.04]Focus on one at a time.
[158:45.91]Good.
[158:49.19]Nice.
[158:49.59]This one too.
[158:53.27]Right behind us.
[158:55.97]Done.
[158:56.53]Good.
[158:57.48]Watch out.
[159:01.14]Good teamwork so far.
[159:07.47]It's empty.
[159:09.59]Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it.
[159:29.38]I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.
[159:30.68]Don't die. Don't die. Don't die.
[159:32.08]Please don't die.
[159:39.98]Where is he?
[159:40.52]Let's go.
[159:48.15]God!
[159:52.71]Thank you.
[160:02.21]How you doing?
[160:03.43]You're okay.
[160:06.30]Fuck.
[160:08.38]Now he's gonna be infected.
[160:10.80]Don't say that!
[160:12.42]He's not gonna be infected.
[160:16.11]He's not infected.
[160:48.20]Does it say it here?
[160:55.50]Miscellaneous information?
[160:56.95]No.
[161:01.17]Trust?
[161:02.21]No.
[161:02.45]Synopsis?
[161:03.37]No.
[161:05.03]Fear?
[161:07.29]Is it on that... that syringe?
[161:09.45]Does it say it?
[161:12.23]That's so weirdly specific enough that I think it's real.
[161:20.48]Why does my hair look like a doormat?
[161:22.00]It doesn't make any sense.
[161:26.74]A doormat?
[161:29.04]What?
[161:37.82]What the fuck are you talking about?
[161:39.30]Alright, if subject is infected... Wait.
[161:44.76]If the subject is infected, will it explode to use blood test?
[161:57.76]My fucking god.
[162:09.29]God fucking give me a break.
[162:10.93]He's not infected!
[162:12.23]I'm gonna do that every fucking time.
[162:18.43]He's running out of blood.
[162:19.57]Alright.
[162:21.10]You go repair the thing.
[162:26.34]I'm gonna go up and not fall off the fucking cliff.
[162:41.67]Nice shooting, actually, for real.
[162:46.41]Like, not kidding.
[162:47.81]For real, that was great.
[162:48.83]Alright, you got full ammo.
[162:59.47]Oh, you do now.
[163:00.11]Alright.
[163:02.53]Stay in my sight.
[163:12.71]No, wait.
[163:13.09]I gotta go from here.
[163:15.57]Okay.
[163:16.71]Please do not fall off.
[163:20.23]I'm so paranoid now.
[163:21.97]It's like kind of wonky and slippery.
[163:25.81]I can walk though.
[163:26.44]What's the walk command?
[163:27.50]There it is.
[163:32.28]Everybody thinks this is overkill.
[163:34.79]It's not.
[163:35.27]That ammo over there is not in the gun that I care about, right?
[163:37.87]He's infected.
[163:44.25]No, no fall joke.
[163:46.73]That's so far back.
[163:51.08]You know what I'm saying?
[163:52.28]It's so far back that why would I do that?
[163:54.28]I'm not going to do that.
[163:57.20]It's too far back.
[164:00.81]Okay.
[164:01.79]This way.
[164:05.63]Let me just get the ammo.
[164:10.67]You just did it 15 minutes ago.
[164:17.72]I- I'm not- If I look at chat, that means I'm not looking at the game.
[164:22.16]So, I ain't fucking doing that.
[164:28.26]That's how this shit happens.
[164:30.64]Because I go... Oh.
[164:33.89]What?
[164:34.61]What did they say?
[164:43.20]I'm not going to look until I'm safe.
[164:45.66]Not fucking happening.
[164:48.48]Now I'm paranoid.
[164:49.44]Now I think I'm going to fall.
[164:50.56]And I looked over there at you.
[164:53.55]Okay.
[164:53.67]Okay.
[165:15.50]I don't need to mute if I'm going to be quiet.
[165:20.72]What's the point of doing that?
[165:22.32]Okay, I'm good.
[165:23.02]Wait, how do I get over there?
[165:27.24]Okay, like this?
[165:30.76]No emotion.
[165:36.37]Oh, it was a message.
[165:37.87]Okay, hold on.
[165:38.47]I can't... Okay, I made it.
[165:43.87]Hold on.
[165:51.61]I need the key first.
[165:52.77]I need to be safe.
[165:54.27]Keycard.
[165:55.55]Computer.
[166:00.87]Construction of the test chambers has been relatively smooth.
[166:03.03]We lost another three workers in an accident last week, but the boss doesn't seem to think that is a reasonable excuse for being a few days behind schedule.
[166:10.42]I can't get any more hands on this project.
[166:11.92]The workers have been glorifying their experiences here when they returned to base, and as a result, people are too scared to come here.
[166:19.81]Okay, hold on.
[166:20.95]I can't alt-tab, so I need to... Hold on a second.
[166:26.96]How do I get over there?
[166:30.81]Alright, somebody... I cannot alt-tab.
[166:33.23]It'll crash the game.
[166:35.29]Copy and paste who said it and what they said.
[166:48.77]They said, you stink.
[166:49.87]No, somebody get it.
[166:54.39]Turn off your lights.
[166:59.05]It said, literally, haha, made you look.
[167:03.58]It was $50, 5,000 bits from kernel 0.
[167:06.56]And they said, I made you look.
[167:07.58]You did, actually.
[167:09.84]You actually did do that.
[167:11.50]Because I didn't know what it was at first.
[167:17.04]Well, thank you.
[167:18.74]What?
[167:19.18]Close the door, then.
[167:22.94]No, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[167:25.16]Seriously.
[167:27.37]Are you infected?
[167:28.05]They could be infected.
[167:35.23]I didn't have an eye on them.
[167:36.73]Alright, I got the keycard.
[167:37.63]Who gives a shit?
[167:38.29]Let's go.
[167:44.64]Don't shoot that far away with a shotgun.
[167:46.32]What are you, dumb?
[167:48.18]Are you actually stupid?
[167:50.70]You don't fire from like a hundred thousand feet away.
[167:57.48]I'm being toxic.
[168:07.42]Where's the keycard thing over here?
[168:13.21]He's being toxic.
[168:14.35]I'm not being toxic.
[168:19.84]Alright, get in here.
[168:22.02]Thank God.
[168:25.62]Save scum test?
[168:26.88]No.
[168:35.45]Get over here.
[168:35.87]Get over here.
[168:36.25]Where are you going?
[168:48.13]It's you!
[168:50.07]What?!
[168:51.35]Why?!
[168:51.83]I should've s- When did this happen?!
[168:56.67]Why does this keep happening to me?!
[168:58.23]I fucking knew it too when he- I left him for too long.
[169:19.45]Why can't I see the chat now?
[169:20.93]What happened to my chat room?
[169:30.35]Alone again.
[169:30.95]At least I got the shotgun back.
[169:37.72]Not that I use it.
[169:40.68]He used a bath bomb.
[169:42.04]Test him.
[169:50.23]What is... What?
[169:51.67]Oh my... Wish I... Wish I had a fucking friend.
[169:57.52]Wish I had a friend.
[169:58.38]I don't even have any... Hold on.
[170:01.64]I... I... Grenades.
[170:07.84]I have... Regular grenade.
[170:12.35]Grenade.
[170:33.02]Please.
[170:35.26]One, two, three.
[170:40.75]One, two, three.
[170:48.81]One, two, three.
[170:57.77]Come on, you're seriously gonna do this?
[170:59.66]You're gonna do the mom from Isaac?
[171:17.29]Oh no!
[171:17.57]You have to hold it!
[171:28.40]What do you mean we told you?
[171:43.05]What do you mean we told you?
[171:45.57]You looked away!
[171:53.48]scripted chat was right we tried to warn you we were right alright let's do this
[172:27.75]What was that?
[172:46.65]Chat was wrong
[173:07.52]Alright, get down here so I can see you.
[173:10.00]Get down here.
[173:11.53]Come here.
[173:34.08]It's scripted.
[173:34.94]It is a scripted one.
[173:36.10]Some of them are scripted.
[173:48.82]So what happens if I do this?
[174:08.96]Why?
[174:09.28]What do you mean, why?
[174:10.84]Ugh.
[174:23.58]Give me the shotgun.
[174:25.80]No, I'm not wasting that.
[174:27.12]Give me this.
[174:29.92]Give me everything you have.
[174:32.40]You're not gonna get up, right?
[174:46.47]Okay.
[174:54.80]Okay.
[174:55.00]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if he comes behind.
[175:10.91]So you're telling me that I could have just... Okay, wait a minute.
[175:14.46]Oh yeah, right.
[175:15.00]Grenades.
[175:16.00]Oh yeah, this part coming up.
[175:17.22]Right.
[175:19.98]Okay, give me the grenades.
[175:24.62]And would... I'm taking care of this.
[175:31.97]What's with the audio?
[175:42.35]That was fucking stupid.
[176:00.50]We're always right.
[176:01.58]Don't run into the grenades.
[176:02.78]Well, I have to make a trail.
[176:03.78]No, I'm just gonna do what I did last time.
[176:22.87]Two.
[176:23.59]Three.
[176:26.52]One.
[176:27.52]Two.
[176:28.42]Three.
[176:30.28]He hit it.
[176:30.90]He exploded in my hand.
[176:33.22]He hit the fucking thing in my hand and it blew up in my hand.
[176:42.98]Okay, I'm... It's a good... It worked last time.
[176:49.84]It was a good strategy.
[176:53.02]What else do I have here?
[176:55.56]I could throw a fl... Okay, I'm gonna throw flame grenades.
[177:02.97]That makes sense, right?
[177:03.87]And then just give me the shotgun and I'm just gonna spam.
[177:26.10]Shoot the gun!
[177:26.92]Is this how a shotgun works?
[177:30.46]What the fuck is happening?
[177:35.39]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[177:37.73]This one is... What the fuck is happening right now?
[177:47.06]I need to... It's giving me a cutscene!
[177:51.48]Is he still alive?
[177:56.38]What is that?
[178:01.11]I just... I just had a cutscene!
[178:04.45]Oh, man...
[178:07.16]Okay.
[178:13.22]It gave me a cutscene, you all know it.
[178:15.70]Alright, fire.
[178:17.35]This thing sucks.
[178:18.05]The shotgun doesn't shoot and then it shoots like seven times in a row.
[178:21.39]It goes, boom!
[178:22.45]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[178:37.34]And I get hit before the cutscene ends.
[178:41.53]Watch this, ready?
[178:42.67]Cutscene's over.
[178:43.75]You just took damage.
[178:57.60]See?
[178:58.10]I thought it was over!
[179:17.42]What the fuck is it?
[179:19.64]Okay, now I need the grenade again.
[179:23.10]One, two, three.
[179:32.33]God damn it!
[179:33.23]Get these little fucks out of here!
[179:34.87]Is it dead?
[179:39.41]I think it's dead.
[179:52.84]You little fucks, will you die?
[179:55.01]Okay, I died.
[180:16.83]Hey, ah, ooh!
[180:25.05]I was standing on the nest.
[180:26.65]How did I survive?
[180:35.62]Okay, everything's dead.
[180:38.54]I have to kill that from here.
[180:41.52]There's nothing else here.
[180:42.78]Wait, don't do that.
[180:55.12]Is that killing it?
[181:03.40]These are NA throws.
[181:12.88]I don't think I can even kill this.
[181:18.48]Got it.
[181:39.20]Okay, fix this machine.
[181:40.56]No enemies, right?
[181:52.43]If one thing comes out, I'm dead.
[182:17.57]Okay.
[182:24.38]I have no- I'm gonna die!
[182:56.16]I take one hit, I'm fucking dead.
[183:02.34]I don't have any... Use my health... I don't have any health packs.
[183:11.21]I don't have any flamethrower.
[183:12.97]I have this, but it's not.
[183:13.95]You have to hold it too long.
[183:14.85]One, two, three, go.
[183:32.97]He's in that one.
[183:49.48]He's in that one.
[183:49.94]Don't open that one.
[183:52.88]My hands just got itchy from that.
[183:55.36]He's locked up.
[184:04.30]Grenade.
[184:05.72]Test.
[184:06.56]You're infected.
[184:07.18]What?
[184:09.86]I'm throwing a grenade at the room.
[184:10.96]It's going to kill it.
[184:11.86]Watch this.
[184:13.44]This is a game from like fucking 1923, whatever.
[184:15.89]1925.
[184:16.53]It's going to hurt him.
[184:18.91]Watch this.
[184:19.21]Ready?
[184:23.83]I might kill him with this.
[184:50.52]I see blood.
[184:54.78]One more.
[184:55.12]One more.
[184:55.48]One more.
[184:55.72]That's it.
[184:55.96]I'm done.
[185:03.62]He moved a little.
[185:04.38]It's alright.
[185:04.68]I did nothing.
[185:05.72]You're hurting the door.
[185:06.64]I have to do... Do you know how far back I have to start?
[185:13.23]If I get touched.
[185:24.58]Hey!
[185:28.17]Fucking angry cat.
[185:46.92]I'm almost out of bullets.
[185:50.86]Stop coming up.
[185:53.90]Stop coming out!
[185:58.18]Stop!
[186:00.36]Stop coming out of this!
[186:04.34]Oh no.
[186:24.13]Mm.
[186:24.31]Mm.
[186:24.43]Mm.
[186:52.52]He was playing a fucking shooter game on me!
[186:55.42]He was- Fuck, I'm in so much trouble.
[187:23.01]Shoot the gun, why does it take so long?
[187:28.27]When I'm aiming down and going like this, I'm pressing click.
[187:40.44]What?
[187:40.82]No!
[187:45.96]Did you hear how many times I clicked?
[187:51.75]What the fuck is going on with this bullshit?
[187:56.54]Why are there so many?
[187:57.68]What the f- I'm never gonna go.
[188:05.82]I'm never gonna get in this room.
[188:12.39]And they do this like-
[188:20.61]Oh, how many more are in here?
[188:27.70]This is stupid!
[188:49.59]Oh.
[188:50.21]My.
[188:51.53]Fucking.
[188:52.81]God.
[189:00.40]Why the fuck that one just stopped caring?
[189:20.92]My shotgun is broken.
[189:23.74]My shotgun is broken.
[189:25.06]It's a broken shotgun.
[189:28.29]It's got like 400 millisecond lag.
[189:34.57]They don't... Do I just have to go?
[189:42.99]This is never gonna stop.
[189:45.71]It's never gonna stop.
[189:48.99]It's never gonna stop.
[189:50.23]It's never gonna stop.
[189:52.12]This never ends.
[189:57.56]Shoot the fucking gun!
[189:59.64]Shoot the gun!
[190:01.14]Shoot!
[190:02.23]Shoot!
[190:03.09]Shoot!
[190:04.25]Shoot!
[190:05.31]Shoot!
[190:05.77]I'm gone!
[190:18.82]Where is... Okay, I'm safe.
[190:32.21]We've taken a number of the research specimens and are running tests on them, the most interesting of which is taking place in the growth chamber.
[190:39.61]Access code 7291.
[190:44.50]Where the dead specimens have responded to the treatments and are showing results of up to 400% cell growth.
[190:50.18]The next stage is to attempt reanimation of cells.
[190:53.76]Dr. Dean Faraday.
[190:56.59]Find Faraday.
[191:13.53]I have to go pee.
[191:16.06]Holy shit, that was stressful.
[191:17.18]Alright, I'll be right back.
[191:19.58]I'm gonna pee.
[191:23.47]Why am I so mad today?
[191:25.35]What?
[191:26.75]Mad.
[191:31.24]I'm mad.
[191:31.94]Alright, I'll be right back.
[197:26.36]Okay, I'm back.
[197:28.49]I wanted to get a little tea to drink as well.
[197:34.29]But I have a funny story for you.
[197:35.37]It has to do with The Thing.
[197:39.34]So I've seen The Thing a few times.
[197:41.98]And Kim had never seen The Thing.
[197:46.10]So, Kim, you want to watch The Thing?
[197:50.34]Yeah, yeah, that sounds great.
[197:51.76]You've never seen it before?
[197:52.62]No?
[197:52.96]Okay, awesome.
[197:54.28]So we sat down to watch it.
[197:56.08]And after maybe like 45 minutes or so, it started to get really, really interesting.
[198:02.69]Really in-depth.
[198:04.29]Wow, this is getting really crazy.
[198:07.19]Wow, this is a good movie.
[198:09.34]Right?
[198:10.48]Another probably 15 minutes go by, and I notice that she's on her phone.
[198:15.04]I'm like, what are you doing on your phone?
[198:16.74]Oh, nothing, nothing.
[198:18.52]I look over.
[198:20.01]And she is reading spoilers for The Thing.
[198:25.04]She's reading spoilers for the movie The Thing.
[198:28.34]The movie that we were currently watching.
[198:34.12]And I was like, why are you... Where you're currently consuming it right now.
[198:40.35]There's like 40 minutes left in the movie.
[198:46.91]It was really funny.
[198:52.46]tester.
[198:58.46]Hey, I'm back.
[199:01.44]There's your boomer wallpaper, right guys?
[199:04.13]Wait, is it not on the right?
[199:06.79]I think it's crashed.
[199:07.91]No, it's here.
[199:13.67]Is it?
[199:15.33]Where are my eyebrows?
[199:16.11]They're here.
[199:26.31]Because of the way the light is hitting my face.
[199:28.29]It gives me Batman eyes because I have like a large brow bone.
[199:32.04]As you can see.
[199:34.34]So there they are.
[199:35.58]But I have a large brow bone as you can see.
[199:38.52]So they go like that.
[199:40.12]See?
[199:46.44]It's not the same guy.
[199:47.30]It's a different guy.
[199:47.91]Test him.
[199:50.79]We ain't doing that.
[199:59.13]Alright, so last... What was I doing?
[200:00.93]Panicking.
[200:02.33]Thank God there's a save point, so that's good.
[200:03.83]Uh... Find... Door 3.
[200:08.75]Door 4.
[200:09.17]I have to pick a door.
[200:11.40]Door 1.
[200:14.58]Door 2.
[200:14.88]Okay, I think I'm about to open up the door.
[200:21.16]Uh... I'm opening up the door with the alien in it.
[200:27.15]Can they all be open at the same time?
[200:30.56]And why can I not open door one?
[200:35.53]Door one is broken.
[200:36.31]Alright, all the doors are now open.
[200:39.95]What is this?
[200:40.97]Oh, it's... Oh shit, what is that?
[200:54.10]Take it.
[200:58.88]Yeah, I already know it's down here.
[200:59.83]We're throwing a grenade in that room.
[201:00.97]Number three is the one that we're throwing the grenade in.
[201:03.29]Let's hope I live that long.
[201:18.04]There was something... I knew it.
[201:19.44]I knew it was... I knew one was still alive.
[201:27.77]This is bad.
[201:29.49]Because I really don't have any ammo.
[201:31.41]Okay, three.
[201:35.41]Turn the corner.
[201:39.95]Two.
[201:41.13]There's three.
[201:43.13]Get it in the room.
[201:49.83]Ah!
[201:58.87]Fire!
[201:59.25]Fire!
[201:59.55]I need fire.
[202:08.33]Where are you going?
[202:09.45]What are you doing?
[202:17.04]He can't be set on fire.
[202:22.38]What the fuck was that?
[202:30.53]No, wait, he's coming out of the room?
[202:33.15]Since when?
[202:33.69]Why does it change?
[202:38.98]Does he know where I am?
[203:10.53]Is that my guy right here?
[203:12.15]Or is that scripted?
[203:30.54]That's my guy.
[203:35.48]God damn it.
[203:36.58]Okay.
[203:37.90]No, I can hear him.
[203:52.36]This is gonna be- this is gonna be really hard.
[204:04.24]Hey, remember when that person said that you can really easily softlock yourself in the thing?
[204:10.48]Well...
[204:15.84]There he is.
[204:16.34]I can hear him sprinting.
[204:20.68]Okay, if I don't press the button, it doesn't happen, right?
[204:30.91]If I don't look at it, it doesn't happen.
[204:39.71]Where'd it go?
[204:42.05]Where'd that just go?
[204:54.56]Save it.
[205:05.24]What else do I have for guns?
[205:06.60]I mean, I can't burn it.
[205:08.51]I gotta burn it.
[205:10.33]But I've gotta hurt it first.
[205:14.07]Oh, man.
[205:19.36]Where is it?
[205:21.92]Where is he?
[205:22.90]He's right there.
[205:24.78]He's like taking a shower.
[205:26.88]Alright, here we go.
[205:28.38]Ready?
[205:32.00]What the fuck did it go?
[205:33.06]Did I hit him?
[205:50.14]What happened?
[205:58.25]I have to burn him.
[205:59.43]I can't.
[205:59.87]It's not going to work.
[206:01.55]Okay.
[206:02.07]I'm just getting out the little torch.
[206:04.59]And I'm going to put on... I don't know.
[206:07.45]I don't know.
[206:11.03]I have to just burn it.
[206:46.06]Oh, this is gonna be fucking hard.
[206:48.92]This is gonna be so difficult to actually get this done.
[206:54.83]I have a new idea.
[206:57.35]Alright, here we go.
[206:58.61]I have to light him on fire, throw a grenade under his feet.
[207:01.63]It's the only way.
[207:18.46]It was like 25 feet in front of me!
[207:31.99]Because I can't light him on fire in here.
[207:33.49]I'm going to bring him in the other room.
[207:39.29]Come here.
[207:44.76]He's not going to open the door?
[207:48.10]Open the door.
[207:49.26]Open the door.
[208:06.29]Why does he do this shit?
[208:11.43]Oh my god, why does he do the thing where he just runs backwards and then like stands fucking still for five seconds and then he goes, you know what, now I guess I'll get you.
[208:29.68]Seems like a good time.
[208:33.04]Follow me into the fucking room!
[208:38.18]In!
[208:39.58]In!
[208:41.60]In!
[208:44.88]Die!
[208:50.20]Ja!
[208:55.64]What's going on?
[208:58.06]What's going on?! !
[209:07.62]Why did it just go bang, bang, bang?
[209:09.46]Alright, I'm good.
[209:19.03]Save it.
[209:21.41]I'm gonna lose track.
[209:26.38]This sucks.
[209:27.28]I need health.
[209:30.26]Big mood.
[209:41.04]What do you mean, big mood?
[209:43.66]What does that mean?
[209:44.48]Is there another one?
[209:46.82]What's this?
[210:01.04]New gun and a tester.
[210:03.92]What is that?
[210:05.76]Grenade launcher.
[210:06.38]I have one shot in it.
[210:16.14]I'm not gonna have the funny, look-it-he-walked-into-the-tiny-fire joke happen to me.
[210:22.83]Not right now.
[210:29.48]Somebody else will think that's funny.
[210:31.04]Not me.
[210:32.02]Real flame... exposure.
[210:37.82]You know what I was trying to say.
[210:39.00]I don't know.
[210:39.52]It's... I'm stressed, alright?
[210:47.29]So how do I open up one?
[210:52.61]No health.
[210:54.35]I opened up four, but where's four?
[210:56.35]There's one, two, three, four.
[210:59.23]Where's four?
[211:04.21]I'm so busy freaking out, I don't even know where four is.
[211:07.89]Right here?
[211:08.25]Uh-oh.
[211:18.11]It's here
[211:48.44]Even the fucking Sims get more than a tenth of a second when their kitchen lights on fire.
[211:56.03]It's not fair.
[212:24.02]Does adrenaline give you health?
[212:26.66]Anybody know?
[212:27.02]You have to be so far away from this shit.
[212:40.47]Give me my fire.
[212:42.67]Put it on.
[212:45.21]Alright.
[212:48.36]Now I have to just... I have to leave.
[212:50.02]I have to just run away.
[212:51.10]Okay.
[212:53.45]I'm, like, biting my lips.
[212:54.63]This is just stress.
[212:57.83]What about this?
[213:00.41]Nope.
[213:00.93]Alright.
[213:04.29]Don't waste the precious fire.
[213:05.92]No, I'm not.
[213:06.52]I'm going right from here, right into that door.
[213:09.42]And if that door don't open, then I don't know what to do.
[213:19.92]I thought that fall just killed me.
[213:21.30]Go-
[213:23.27]I'm turn- I'm just turning to leave!
[213:25.52]I'm just trying to leave!
[213:27.46]Fucking soft walk.
[213:37.04]Mm-mm.
[213:47.27]D'oh!
[213:47.71]I forgot!
[213:48.41]Right.
[213:51.21]Oh, I have to save it after this too.
[213:56.02]That doesn't kill me though.
[214:09.10]Save the damn game.
[214:11.18]Save it.
[214:24.13]I'm being such a good lip-biter.
[214:28.31]Alright.
[214:29.70]Let's go.
[214:29.98]Where the hell is it?
[214:39.74]That's why.
[214:47.73]Okay, I'm dead.
[214:55.97]Holy fuck!
[214:56.81]What?
[215:13.65]I did it.
[215:18.32]Oh, thank god.
[215:19.04]Now I don't die instantly.
[215:25.55]Alright.
[215:25.85]Is there still fire out here?
[215:29.01]Yes, there is.
[215:58.97]If this fire extinguisher dies, I can't do it.
[216:12.18]How do I get out of here?
[216:16.90]Turn on the water?
[216:20.46]How do I turn the fucking water on?
[216:40.98]Shoot barrel?
[216:42.14]Barrel?
[216:42.62]What do you see?
[216:43.06]A barrel?
[216:45.64]Shoot barrel?
[216:49.35]Oh.
[216:50.19]Guys, that's like the se- it's bl- look at it, it's- I can't see that.
[217:01.41]It was- come on.
[217:03.29]That's tricky.
[217:04.49]Alright, no fucking around.
[217:14.10]Save it.
[217:22.42]No, save it, save it.
[217:23.20]Where am I going?
[217:24.42]Control Room 1.
[217:35.83]Okay.
[217:40.63]Okay.
[217:49.03]Okay, I, I, no, I, uh... Now what?
[218:04.69]What's four?
[218:05.31]I don't know, man.
[218:15.20]Yeah, I don't know either.
[218:17.17]There's one, two, three.
[218:18.29]I can't open one.
[218:19.07]One's like broken.
[218:28.23]Shoot the other barrel.
[218:33.74]Shoot the other barrel.
[218:38.00]Wait, was there another barrel?
[218:43.06]Barrel near one?
[218:44.48]It's possible.
[218:45.26]Maybe.
[218:45.48]Because I don't see any other way to go.
[218:48.14]No, there's nothing here.
[218:58.04]No barrels or anything?
[219:02.16]I think I have to repair the door control, but where do I go to do that?
[219:05.62]Because I opened up four.
[219:14.97]Throw a grenade at the door?
[219:15.92]I only get one shot at this.
[219:25.06]Nope.
[219:28.44]Remember when we had friends?
[219:29.65]I do.
[219:35.51]Let me go back.
[219:38.35]This way.
[219:40.19]Because... How did I even get in here?
[219:42.37]I was in a total panic.
[219:48.49]How did I even get in this room?
[219:54.54]Maybe I have to look at the C-C-C-T?
[219:59.32]V-V?
[219:59.84]Wait a minute, nope.
[220:03.36]Kinda like... Hydraulic Overdried.
[220:15.67]Does he have something like a note or something or a code or a keypad or something?
[220:24.16]Hydraulic override.
[220:26.76]I can't like touch it.
[220:34.45]Hmm.
[220:37.31]I have no idea.
[220:38.43]Because this looks like the way you would want to go.
[220:40.15]There we go.
[221:04.96]Got it.
[221:15.41]There is a huge guy over here somewhere, though.
[221:17.09]I'm gonna take a flamethrower.
[221:34.56]When the shotgun fires, it's very good.
[221:39.22]When the shotgun fires, it works well.
[221:55.73]I want a friend so bad.
[221:57.19]I need a friend right now.
[222:01.62]Anybody.
[222:02.38]I wish it was the medic...
[222:12.19]What the fuck is going on?
[222:21.29]I hear a beeper.
[222:30.20]Alive?
[222:33.40]No.
[222:33.88]Damn it.
[222:37.38]It's a maze in here, too.
[222:40.32]Yep, okay.
[222:41.28]I hear you.
[222:42.38]Why do I have zero?
[222:47.22]What happened here?
[222:47.80]Why do I have zero in my grenade launcher?
[222:49.40]What happened?
[222:58.99]I threw it.
[223:00.71]Oh, it's a grenade launcher.
[223:04.10]It's an actual grenade launcher.
[223:09.26]Not like a grenade launcher.
[223:10.90]It's a grenade device that shoots a grenade out of its cannon.
[223:17.46]Why would I ever use that if I can just throw the grenade?
[223:24.61]He's in here.
[223:42.43]Where is this motherfucker?
[223:47.29]I can hear him just stomping around.
[223:53.09]He's in here, I bet.
[223:55.28]Yep.
[223:55.68]Mickey, I think this is where the guy died.
[224:01.57]Yep, definitely.
[224:05.87]What?
[224:09.52]Die, die!
[224:09.96]But you die already!
[224:10.98]What are you doing over here?
[224:11.98]You're just, what you're doing is you're pissing me off.
[224:14.74]You're just pissing me off.
[224:16.44]That's your goal.
[224:28.19]Computer.
[224:29.79]Bullets.
[224:34.14]Of course it's broken.
[224:35.06]Give me a break.
[224:40.43]Hello.
[224:41.45]Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
[224:46.16]Die.
[224:46.66]Burn.
[224:47.22]Burn.
[224:47.82]I am never going to find my way out of here.
[224:54.08]In a million years.
[225:08.00]Wait, I don't want to miss anything.
[225:09.10]What if there's like a health pack in here?
[225:12.54]Do you hear that?
[225:27.10]You hear that, right?
[225:27.98]The little beep?
[225:31.00]Oh, fuck.
[225:35.14]Is he above me or below me?
[225:38.87]I don't know.
[225:39.29]I'm not gonna stick around to find out.
[225:40.60]Let's just keep going.
[225:48.70]Slow it down.
[225:49.58]Something's gonna break through the ceiling.
[225:55.54]Control room.
[225:56.10]I'm gonna save it.
[226:11.63]I turned all the way around and came all the way back.
[226:18.71]Um, okay.
[226:34.42]So what did I miss down here?
[226:40.75]That's what I missed.
[226:43.15]The one corner.

[227:22.38]This is the big one too.
[227:23.64]This is like the big flamethrower If only everybody I ever knew didn't turn into a monster I'd be swell Again the game started with three fucking friends and now I'm just it's just me alone in the dark.
[227:43.57]Oh
[227:55.53]Does he- he doesn't chase you, he like de-aggro's.
[228:04.64]Bwah!
[228:32.50]Will you fucking die?
[228:33.92]He's running very fast at me now.
[228:37.83]Now all of a sudden you want to fight.
[228:39.11]Now all of a sudden.
[228:40.01]Like right now.
[228:40.61]This is it.
[228:41.15]This is your attempt.
[228:44.93]No, no, no, no, actually, I don't want to fight you.
[228:46.97]I don't want to now.
[228:47.67]I'm just gonna, like, suck vacuum cleaner back to the fucking spawn.
[229:03.44]I didn't realize it was my curfew.
[229:05.96]Come on.
[229:11.07]Oh, there's something over here.
[229:12.23]Ooh.
[229:13.61]Didn't even see this shit before.

[229:17.32]I guess I'll take it.
[229:18.70]Ooh, what happened there?
[229:23.24]I can't get that open?
[229:27.03]Fuck.
[229:29.59]Fuck.
[229:30.59]Okay.
[229:33.63]Let's go back.
[229:35.09]Hit the button.
[229:37.32]Activate the, you know, the crowd of people that I'm going to activate.
[229:40.84]Well, I'm going the wrong way.
[229:41.56]Yeah, this is back the way I came.
[229:44.64]I almost just said this is back the way I came.
[229:51.57]By the way, if you ever designed a ship like this, you are fucking stupid.
[229:55.41]Like, intention- what is this building?
[230:04.98]Toxic no, that's reality.
[230:09.12]Why would you make like a mouse and cheese maze?
[230:11.82]Alright, I can open one You didn't have anything else on you, right?
[230:21.40]Do I like this game?
[230:22.18]Yeah, it's pretty good.
[230:27.29]I think it's fun
[230:29.86]I want more friends.
[230:31.28]I like the idea of your friends can turn into monsters without you knowing.
[230:40.03]Just wait for the later sections?
[230:41.43]Oh god, I don't even want to know.
[230:51.68]Oh fucking god.
[230:57.18]What's with his arm?
[230:58.32]Why does he have, like, a... What's with his arm?
[231:02.40]What's with his arm?
[231:03.96]Why is he a super mutant?
[231:08.70]Where's he going?
[231:12.92]Oh my god.
[231:16.62]I need to save it.
[231:18.08]You're blocking my path to save the game.
[231:22.63]Did he go this way?
[231:23.33]I don't know which way he went.
[231:24.87]I don't know.
[231:25.25]Did he tether back to home?
[231:47.90]Where?
[231:48.44]What?
[231:50.06]He's right here, isn't he?
[231:52.64]I hate that sound.
[232:03.03]What?
[232:16.38]There better not be another one.
[232:21.57]Thank god.
[232:25.29]Save this game.
[232:27.91]Open up number one.
[232:32.05]Prep lab, here we go.
[232:32.93]Just save it here.
[232:47.65]Nope, wrong way.
[232:50.90]I think it's time to do a tactic where I just run.
[232:54.90]I need another one of those rooms that has everything in it.
[232:57.71]Like a Left 4 Dead safe house.
[233:02.01]One has to be coming up soon, right?
[233:04.47]What was that?
[233:12.36]It broke out, but where is it?
[233:23.97]Where is it?
[233:24.39]I don't see it.
[233:33.40]Shoot barrel.
[233:35.48]Shoot barrel?
[233:40.44]Uh, he shot it.
[233:45.53]He already got it.
[233:46.19]Let the door kill me.
[233:48.05]The door closed on me and fucking murdered me.
[234:08.84]Use your bang sticks.
[234:10.18]What?
[234:16.48]Shoot barrel.
[234:19.68]There it is.
[234:20.20]Barrel.
[234:24.86]All of you can... Didn't I say that I was not going to be listening to the chat room anymore?
[234:31.96]I did say that a while ago.
[234:40.00]I did say that.
[234:41.32]Multiple times.
[234:42.17]Right.
[234:49.05]Holy sh- Not possible without friends.
[234:51.55]Not possible- Impossible without a group of friends.
[234:54.21]I need like a whole party here.
[234:55.66]I need like a fucking healer.
[234:57.44]I need a demolitions expert.
[234:59.40]I need somebody that can summon like a fucking spirit like they do in Final Fantasy.
[235:04.42]I need everybody.
[235:05.20]I'm not being- This is not possible without a friend.
[235:16.80]Oh, for the love of God.
[235:28.60]Don't run.
[235:30.18]Don't run.
[235:31.60]Don't run.
[235:36.22]Don't run.
[235:38.83]Don't you.
[235:40.29]Don't run.
[235:45.95]He's running.
[235:47.79]Why?
[235:56.40]Okay.
[235:58.74]There's another one up there.
[236:01.04]Just trying to find a way down.
[236:02.80]I could save it here, but I might softlock myself.
[236:04.78]We're going all the way to the bottom.
[236:07.91]Look at all these doors.
[236:09.69]Oh no, don't even fucking do this to me.
[236:15.50]I... That... This sucks, if that's what I think it is.
[236:17.99]Alright, uh, I gotta kill the guy up here.
[236:24.45]Because there's tons of items up there.
[236:26.87]Speaking of items, I know I picked up at least one of these.
[236:36.68]Oh, he's back at the door.
[236:37.68]Okay.
[236:39.30]Uh, what do I got?
[236:39.86]Let me just use this.
[236:43.68]I ran through so many items, but it separated them, so that's good.
[236:48.48]Come here.
[236:49.82]It's the guy with the super arm.
[236:51.02]Alright.
[236:55.20]It's a Power Rangers villain.
[236:57.56]That's what... Okay, I can't open the door?
[237:05.93]I could do this all day.
[237:06.65]Run around this...
[237:22.59]I'm out of... I'm out of it.
[237:24.31]I'm out of... No, I'm not.
[237:25.91]Am I?
[237:44.85]Okay.
[237:47.17]What else was back here?
[237:49.63]I did just sprint by.
[237:50.89]There's a lot of random shit over here we got.
[237:54.24]Okay, we have a tester.
[237:57.14]I can take it slow.
[238:00.26]Books.
[238:00.58]Books.
[238:08.17]Take as many of these as I can carry.
[238:12.26]I have ten of them now.
[238:13.58]The game... Well, not yet, because I need health.
[238:16.68]I mean, I need ammo.
[238:20.64]Look.
[238:21.10]Look, clip.
[238:21.66]Look at the clip.
[238:23.52]I can't... I can't alt-tab.
[238:24.82]If I alt-tab, it fucks everything up.
[238:27.58]I can't do it.
[238:28.56]Save it.
[238:31.45]What about this way?
[238:33.25]I can repair this.
[238:34.03]No, I can't.
[238:41.62]Oh, there's a bunch of shit in there.
[238:42.76]Come on.
[238:44.72]What about this way?
[238:48.70]No, just check in to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[238:52.66]And there's a spot.
[238:57.62]We gotta get out of here.
[238:59.18]Some of my guys are trapped in the testing chambers.
[239:07.61]Give me a weapon.
[239:09.83]You sure you got a...
[239:49.71]When did I save it?
[239:50.73]I saved it right before that, right?
[239:52.39]Okay, let's go do it.
[239:53.59]Let me go save.
[239:54.27]Wait, when did I save it?
[239:55.15]When was the last time I saved it?
[240:00.17]Tuber.
[240:01.11]That was a tuber joke.
[240:09.00]Two hours ago, before the health kits.
[240:10.92]Alright, I'm good.
[240:11.44]220.
[240:14.18]What?
[240:18.23]The bottom one, yeah.
[240:19.15]Right?
[240:24.53]Oh, this is a long-ass time ago.
[240:26.23]Oh, come on.
[240:27.19]Actually, no it's not.
[240:35.10]It's just with the Power Rangers villain.
[240:42.66]Come here!
[240:53.53]Just close the door.
[240:55.05]Eh.
[241:03.69]One more should do it.
[241:10.16]Come on.
[241:12.88]And there it is.
[241:25.69]Okay.
[241:27.66]So, I can explain.
[241:29.78]Um... I got startled and freaked out and shot.
[241:34.42]Shot him two or three times.
[241:35.98]And then realized, well, it's over now.
[241:37.68]I'm gonna restart anyways.
[241:44.20]The link!
[241:44.70]The link!
[241:45.28]I can't click the link!
[241:54.07]You did it for the video.
[241:57.72]No, I didn't.
[242:00.68]I got, alright, I stick the guy with a fucking needle and I go like this and all of a sudden I hear a noise.
[242:07.82]And I hear a boom and I get fucking attacked in a cutscene.
[242:16.87]Look at it in, alright, let me, I'm going to open up on my phone.
[242:25.40]Alright, post the link so I can see it.
[242:31.88]I'm getting dizzy.
[242:33.42]I'm getting dizzy laughing so hard at this picture.
[242:37.83]Why?
[242:38.73]What does that mean?
[242:42.50]What does that mean?
[242:45.40]Link it.
[242:47.10]Link it?
[243:04.42]Holy shit, is that real?
[243:06.82]No, it's not It's not real, right?
[243:29.37]Oh my god!
[243:31.75]It looks like somebody's firing a fucking like discombobulator ray into my face!
[243:38.77]It's not real!
[243:45.81]Is it real?
[243:50.35]It's not real, right?
[243:55.33]Somebody have a clip to prove that.
[243:57.82]There's no way that that's real.
[244:05.55]It's not, right?
[244:06.33]Holy shit, that's fucking insane.
[244:12.83]That can't be real.
[244:13.83]I was... I have it up full screen in my second... Hold on, where's the... Give me the real one.
[244:28.93]There's a real one.
[244:30.77]Holy shit, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
[244:36.01]I thought, I thought, I thought I looked like that for real.
[244:40.41]Oh, this is, please give me the real one.
[244:47.54]I'm like, I'm like boogers coming out of my nose.
[244:54.05]That's fucked.
[244:57.95]A human doesn't look like that.
[244:59.85]Okay, so it's not fucking real.
[245:09.57]I thought it was, I thought it was real.
[245:11.30]Holy fuck.
[245:25.80]Imagine, okay, just hold on a second.
[245:27.54]You guys are quick.
[245:29.00]Imagine looking at a picture that like is your face and it's, I don't know.
[245:34.38]It could have been real.
[245:37.57]I've had pictures taken of me going like this and I have like a huge chin and it was real.
[245:46.14]I don't know what's real and what's not anymore, but that was fucking ridiculous.
[245:52.76]Check the clips.
[246:01.35]It's real.
[246:02.37]Somebody give me a clip.
[246:06.21]Give me a clip.
[246:06.79]I'll save it.
[246:09.69]New emote.
[246:10.91]I mean, that's pretty ridiculous.
[246:12.93]Unedited.
[246:16.26]It's not real.
[246:19.52]Okay.
[246:26.84]Yoda.
[246:27.48]Okay, hold on.
[246:27.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[246:32.85]No, I have to play.
[246:34.23]I have to get over this.
[246:36.62]Holy shit.
[246:43.71]If my mother was watching right now, she'd be like, what's wrong with him?
[246:52.49]She is.
[246:52.93]I need to just put that on screen because for people that are watching the VOD that maybe have no idea what's going on, I need to show that.
[247:04.66]Give me a second.
[247:05.64]I need to save it.
[247:08.16]That image has to be shown on the big screen.
[247:11.50]Let me save the game.
[247:14.42]We traumatized him.
[247:15.34]You really did.
[247:16.10]My eyes are like going in different directions.
[247:17.88]My mouth is huge.
[247:19.28]I look like a fucking cartoon character, man.
[247:25.21]It was scary.
[247:26.11]It was scary and it could have been real.
[247:28.91]But why would it have been real?
[247:30.33]I don't know.
[247:31.01]But I thought it was.
[247:32.79]Where the fuck am I?
[247:33.69]No, no, no, no.
[247:34.41]It's right here.
[247:40.69]Okay.
[247:42.37]I'm gonna have to quit for a second.
[247:47.67]One sec.
[247:49.73]We got it saved.
[247:56.16]Let me just go like this.
[247:59.20]This is the original one.
[248:00.52]Where?
[248:00.94]Let me see.
[248:05.23]My god.
[248:05.97]Okay, so this is the original.
[248:09.79]And then give me the fucking crazy one.
[248:21.60]That's so fucked.
[248:23.96]That's so fucked up.
[248:33.05]Alright, so give me like some credit.
[248:35.17]Just look.
[248:37.57]I don't know...
[248:39.82]You know how tough it is to be able to determine what's fucking real and not real?
[248:45.37]Look.
[248:48.41]This is the image.
[248:49.39]This is the original, actual image.
[248:51.51]For those of you watching the VOD.
[248:53.94]This is the image.
[248:56.60]Somebody linked this.
[249:00.54]Okay?
[249:02.94]And they said that this was real.
[249:05.15]And everyone told me it was real.
[249:06.23]And look at how fucking crazy you look.
[249:10.36]like really like that could it could be but it's not it's real it's not don't fucking say that
[249:45.12]This is killing me.
[249:52.78]But I'm... I know the first one's real.
[250:04.84]Oh my god, when I first saw that, man.
[250:08.29]You don't know the emotions going through my brain.
[250:10.47]Cause I- look, remember, this is on a cell phone.
[250:12.81]This is not on my computer.
[250:13.77]I looked it up on my cell phone.
[250:15.50]So it was like all blurry and fucking small.
[250:18.14]Okay.
[250:33.17]And then the big chin thing, right?
[250:34.87]So of course I'm going to be skeptical of what's real or not because those of you that were here for the big chin, I don't mean, you already know what I mean.
[250:48.92]Fucking Jesus.
[250:55.30]I can't get over this yet.
[250:59.34]The chin was real, but that's the thing.
[251:01.64]It's the reverse.
[251:03.12]The chin was real, but I was convinced it was fake.
[251:07.30]This one was fake, and I was convinced this one was real.
[251:13.43]It's just... It's all over the place.
[251:15.41]Alright, back to fucking... the thing.
[251:26.48]I guess.
[251:30.96]Holy shit.
[251:37.04]How is it already a monster in here?
[251:42.37]That is so fucking ridiculous.
[251:45.89]That was a true breakdown on stream.
[251:48.51]Seriously, that was a true breakdown.
[251:50.11]That was a real one.
[251:52.89]It may have been comedy related, but that was a comedy breakdown.
[251:57.38]Here we go.
[252:05.06]Well, there's a new enemy type.
[252:12.07]So these are... I'm going to be opening up doors.
[252:14.31]Oh, wait.
[252:17.43]He's the number one.
[252:20.91]So don't even open any of these.
[252:22.65]I've got to go get that engineer guy.
[252:23.89]Alright, open up one.
[252:25.45]Not yet, though.
[252:26.35]After.
[252:26.55]Wait, there's somebody else here.
[252:33.52]Friends.
[252:34.04]Okay, 1 and 9 have people in them.
[252:40.76]1 and 9.
[252:41.20]2 has a gremlin.
[252:51.10]I think it's just 1 and 9.
[252:52.58]And then I have that engineer.
[252:53.48]We're going to have a full party here in a second.
[252:55.34]Alright.
[253:00.20]Not yet, though.
[253:00.84]I want to make sure I can get over there with the engineer.
[253:04.30]So let's get up here.
[253:08.41]I've got... Ugh, I'm getting, like, stomach pains.
[253:15.89]God damn it.
[253:18.84]Okay, Engineer was in here.
[253:20.40]I got all the health I needed, right?
[253:23.86]Engineer to open that.
[253:25.64]What?
[253:26.31]Oh.
[253:29.48]Where's my medicine?
[253:30.38]I already took it today.
[253:32.12]I take it once in the morning and then once at night.
[253:35.73]Let me heal.
[253:36.31]Do I have full health?
[253:37.47]I will in a second.
[253:41.29]Full health.
[253:42.07]Let's go save the Engineer.
[253:43.21]Alright, where was he at?
[253:49.63]Down this way somewhere?
[253:51.85]There he is.
[253:52.21]Okay, now watch out for the alien that jumps up.
[254:00.61]What's up?
[254:02.35]You need a weapon?
[254:09.19]Price.
[254:11.49]What can I give you?
[254:12.25]How about a shotgun?
[254:14.37]How does that sound?
[254:15.89]Load it.
[254:16.53]Is there only three bullets in there?
[254:21.48]Or three?
[254:21.80]No.
[254:22.06]It's okay.
[254:28.26]Very cool.
[254:29.74]And you're an engineer too, so that's good.
[254:30.94]Do you have full health?
[254:33.12]Yeah, you need ammo.
[254:34.94]Uh... Change that.
[254:37.70]Give me that back.
[254:39.84]I'm gonna give you something in a second.
[254:41.22]I can give you a second one of these.
[254:42.40]Take that.
[254:43.54]Take a couple of clips.
[254:44.54]Take two clips.
[254:46.34]Good.
[254:47.53]Now we're friends.
[254:48.49]Good.
[254:49.11]Awesome.
[254:49.71]Happy to hang out with you.
[254:53.59]You don't like that gun.
[254:54.69]Alright, well that's too bad.
[254:58.06]I want you to open a door for me.
[255:05.38]Ten stun grenades.
[255:07.92]If you could follow me, I'd like you to open a door.
[255:14.72]This one over here.
[255:21.08]Alright.
[255:22.30]Go for it.
[255:28.60]Doesn't know the difference.
[255:31.70]Yeah, but I'm getting the same point across.
[255:33.40]You know what I mean?
[255:43.03]I'm being prepared.
[255:47.43]Let's go save the game.
[255:49.06]Now let's actually give you the shotgun.
[255:54.78]What the hell are you doing?
[255:56.74]Giving you a shotgun.
[255:57.58]And you're getting all the ammo for it, because I don't like you using it.
[256:03.76]Because it sucks.
[256:04.73]What did you just drop on the ground?
[256:09.29]Alright.
[256:11.01]I am ready to save the game.
[256:14.27]Everyone in full health, right?
[256:22.22]Save the game.
[256:23.28]Come with me.
[256:29.79]You good?
[256:37.58]That means he's infected.
[256:39.38]No, it means he doesn't like the sight of people dead.
[256:43.00]Alright.
[256:49.16]Open up number one, which cannot be opened, and number nine.
[256:53.64]Number nine is now open.
[257:05.43]What the fuck?
[257:08.25]What happened?
[257:09.53]What?
[257:32.90]I don't understand, but... Oh, it's eating the little ones.
[257:38.20]Is it?
[257:38.54]Okay.
[257:43.54]Not gonna happen.
[257:45.52]Not gonna happen.
[257:46.18]I know what those things do.
[257:56.57]Wait!
[258:03.46]Nice shot.
[258:05.76]Shoot.
[258:09.48]Shoot it!
[258:11.12]Don't stand in the fire!
[258:22.41]He was infected!
[258:23.45]He puked!
[258:26.45]So they f- Who the fuck are you?!
[258:30.73]What is going on?! !
[258:34.92]Why are they all... Are they all infected immediately?
[259:08.46]Alright, let's do it He gets hit I'm not opening anything till I clear this shit out don't let him get hit then
[259:46.78]Wait.
[259:48.22]What the fuck happened?
[259:48.88]What are you shooting?
[259:49.64]Oh.
[259:51.08]What's up?
[259:53.06]Hi.
[259:53.58]Um, introduce yourself?
[259:55.24]Or don't.
[259:55.74]Do you not- What is he doing?
[260:00.78]Hello?
[260:36.03]I missed!
[260:39.29]Don't let him touch him!
[260:39.93]Don't let him touch him!
[260:47.85]Well, that guy didn't... Maybe because he wasn't even talking, he was just like... Suspicious, or... what?
[260:58.26]Alright, no, he didn't get touched.
[261:03.94]He didn't get touched.
[261:04.52]He didn't get touched.
[261:05.02]I just tested him.
[261:05.60]He didn't even get touched.
[261:08.08]He did not get touched.
[261:09.78]I was watching.
[261:11.66]He's fine.
[261:13.93]I mean, he's a little freaked out, but he's alright now.
[261:18.63]We gotta open doors.
[261:24.64]He's good.
[261:25.08]He didn't get hit.
[261:31.74]That was a little weird.
[261:32.90]I must say that was strange.
[261:34.84]But not... Not illegal, right?
[261:38.72]Weird, but not illegal.
[261:49.19]You're good.
[261:49.83]We're both good, right?
[261:50.75]You got... Yeah, you got full health.
[261:53.73]Time to start opening doors.
[261:54.70]We're gonna open nine...
[262:00.63]You know what?
[262:00.93]Just fucking open all of them.
[262:07.95]Except for one.
[262:47.11]He didn't get hit.
[262:47.77]He didn't get touched.
[262:49.89]Didn't get touched.
[262:51.61]He's fine.
[262:54.12]You're good.
[262:55.04]He didn't get hit.
[262:59.50]Save it.
[263:04.78]Good.
[263:07.38]I can smell it.
[263:08.13]No, he's fine.
[263:09.01]He didn't even get hit.
[263:11.23]He did not take any damage.
[263:21.88]All the way down, right?
[263:29.41]Alright, I go first always.
[263:30.71]Because I don't get infected.
[263:33.27]Because I've got strong blo- I have like strong body, strong blood.
[263:39.45]If I get touched, it doesn't infect me.
[263:41.19]I have like Superman.
[263:42.73]Like, what does Superman have?
[263:43.97]Blood?
[263:44.59]Does Superman have blood?
[263:49.36]It's like green, right?
[263:55.60]The Superman doesn't have red blood, right?
[264:01.84]It's green.
[264:03.30]Is it?
[264:05.18]Yeah, so I have Superman blood.
[264:06.98]Whatever.
[264:07.28]Alright, slow down.
[264:10.22]I just want to make sure there's nothing here.
[264:12.52]Alright, here comes a big guy.
[264:22.51]Right here.
[264:23.53]Wall him off!
[264:25.58]Now you get the shots off, because he can't get in here.
[264:28.74]Shoot the shotgun in there.
[264:29.40]He can't... He can't move anywhere, so... Shoot him in there.
[264:36.85]Whatever.
[264:37.15]Nice try.
[264:38.19]Nice.
[264:45.75]Okay.
[264:51.48]I didn't let him out, see?
[264:52.30]I kept one closed.
[264:55.44]So he couldn't go anywhere.
[264:59.14]Dr. Faraday, I presume.
[265:01.30]I don't think we've got time for formal introductions.
[265:03.63]Can you get us out of here?
[265:05.77]Sure, Doc.
[265:06.39]Follow me.
[265:07.29]Oh, and keep your ass covered.
[265:08.41]I'd hate to see you get an unwanted suppository.
[265:12.29]Alright, it's... Should we test immediately, or what?
[265:18.21]Should we test them both?
[265:23.05]The price has not been touched.
[265:25.26]Faraday on the other hand has half health But I think don't I do I need like his fingerprints to like scan a door Alright, he's clean he's good what about you you still good I
[265:59.80]No, I'm just gonna heal you.
[266:04.73]Do you need a weapon?
[266:05.75]Here.
[266:06.41]Take a weapon.
[266:11.31]I'll give you another submachine gun.
[266:15.05]Don't lose it.
[266:15.63]Don't run away from me.
[266:19.96]Okay.
[266:20.72]Alright.
[266:23.82]Have I checked myself?
[266:25.98]No.
[266:26.58]I don't need it, though.
[266:29.07]Thanks for the concern.
[266:30.47]Alright.
[266:32.61]Nothing else in your room here.
[266:33.85]This door didn't even open.
[266:35.16]Alright, let's go.
[266:38.04]Everybody follow me.
[266:46.42]Anything else?
[266:50.51]Don't shoot me in the fucking back.
[266:54.97]Where'd he go?
[266:55.99]Where's the doctor?
[266:56.75]Where's the doctor?
[266:57.41]Where'd you go?
[266:58.88]God damn it.
[266:59.82]Did he run away?
[267:01.68]That's not a doctor.
[267:02.88]That's not the doctor.
[267:03.98]You got stolen.
[267:05.36]Your body got stolen.
[267:08.87]And you wrapped around and... Whatever.
[267:23.11]I burnt this thing on the way here.
[267:25.01]He didn't get hit.
[267:27.17]Just don't step in the fire.
[267:29.39]Look for his clothes.
[267:36.02]I mean, I'll just torture him if it's- I'll just kill him, it's fine.
[267:48.54]Good.
[267:50.80]Let's go.
[267:59.13]I could roll around on that and not get hurt.
[268:01.18]Like, I could just... I could sit on that and I would not burn my ass.
[268:05.32]That's the level of flame we're talking about.
[268:06.90]Alright, so I've got a team of three here.
[268:12.30]So far.
[268:18.59]So far, so good.
[268:20.93]Now... Oh, you're a medic.
[268:23.21]That's really good to know.
[268:31.55]now we go where do we go now okay don't get hit don't get touched don't let it touch you
[268:53.05]Alright, medic.
[268:55.37]Check this out.
[268:55.95]There's all kinds of stuff in here.
[268:58.24]Where you going?
[268:58.60]Don't.
[268:58.84]Where you going?
[268:59.16]Where you going?
[268:59.48]Where you going?
[268:59.80]Where you going?
[269:00.12]Where you going?
[269:00.44]Where you going?
[269:00.76]Where you going?
[269:01.18]Where you going?
[269:01.50]Where you going?
[269:02.02]It's just closed right there.
[269:07.84]Don't do that shit.
[269:08.86]Stay with me.
[269:11.74]I'm gonna just heal.
[269:12.26]I have free health right here.
[269:15.10]How's everybody else?
[269:15.76]You good?
[269:16.14]Both of you guys are good.
[269:17.77]Stock up.
[269:20.33]And now we go... Let's check over here.
[269:26.01]Refill all of our ammo.
[269:30.33]I'm going to give you... Wait, is there no more ammo in there?
[269:35.40]I think... Wait.
[269:36.32]There is no more in there.
[269:38.14]Okay.
[269:44.76]Let's do it.
[269:59.39]back up back up back up back up back up back up back up back up back up back up back up back up back up back up
[270:27.32]What the fuck is happening?
[270:36.63]Alright, let's get out of here then.
[270:37.41]Let's go.
[270:39.35]I thought I was just shooting him in the face.
[270:44.95]Good.
[270:48.86]Good, good, good, good, good.
[270:51.68]Stay.
[270:52.54]No, no, no, no, no.
[270:53.20]Come over here.
[270:53.84]Both of you.
[270:57.42]Come to me.
[270:59.20]I want both of you over here right now.
[271:00.24]I'm shooting a grenade down this hallway.
[271:02.22]Come here.
[271:04.89]Come over here.
[271:06.45]Both of you stay here.
[271:09.81]Stay.
[271:11.11]I'll take care of this.
[271:21.44]Help!
[271:22.42]I need a medic.
[271:23.48]Medic, could you help me?
[271:28.00]Did you see that?
[271:29.02]Hard blink.
[271:30.64]The hard blink.
[271:32.44]What are you doing?
[271:45.26]What was that?
[271:54.31]He's infected?
[272:04.47]He's clean, guys.
[272:10.29]That is the exact thing a fucking alien would say.
[272:28.90]Yeah, no problem.
[272:52.42]He's freaking out.
[272:55.12]Give me some credit here.
[272:56.74]He's fucking losing his mind.
[273:00.32]See?
[273:04.65]Can I open the door and shoot a grenade to show you that everything's going to be okay?
[273:09.29]What is it?
[273:09.57]What do you want now?
[273:11.31]What is it?
[273:33.29]That's it, right?
[273:35.57]That was a really weird trajectory.
[273:41.94]Stay there.
[273:42.34]Nobody move.
[273:44.64]I'm just making sure that there's nothing else that's gonna...
[273:56.02]Are you dead?
[273:59.44]Okay.
[274:01.40]Fellas!
[274:04.79]Oh, you can't hear me through the door.
[274:05.81]Let's go.
[274:20.76]New zone?
[274:30.95]What the hell?
[274:32.07]Stand down, soldier.
[274:34.13]Good to see you, Doctor.
[274:35.61]We need to talk.
[274:36.71]All in good time.
[274:38.36]But first, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask for your weapons.
[274:40.90]I'm not doing anything until I get some goddamn answers.
[274:44.54]You're out of your league here, Blake.
[274:49.77]Well, actually, this is alright.
[274:51.49]I'm okay with this, because that means I can have them all in my party.
[274:54.91]I feel safe, actually.
[274:56.45]Right now, I feel safe.
[274:58.82]A little premature.
[275:02.24]Right now, we need to have you both tested.
[275:04.02]What the hell are you talking about?
[275:05.90]I'm not infected.
[275:07.54]My men are dying out there.
[275:09.44]I've seen firsthand what this infection is capable of.
[275:12.36]Oh, you have no idea what it can do.
[275:14.73]You son of a bitch!
[275:19.25]What, a slow motion sprint at him?
[275:21.29]Did I just get shot in the head?
[275:26.01]What?
[275:33.91]Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
[275:36.08]It's just a tranquilizer, Faraday.
[275:37.82]Do you have any idea what's going on out there?
[275:41.30]I have a perfect idea.
[275:42.72]Jesus.
[275:43.54]You've done it, haven't you?
[275:45.68]There's so much I have to show you.
[275:47.63]He's infected.
[275:48.77]I think you'll be impressed with the result.
[275:50.89]Tranking somebody in the face.
[275:52.13]Pick up Sleeping Beauty and help escort the good doctor.
[275:57.03]He's had a long day.
[275:59.59]Definitely infected.
[276:05.93]No doubt.
[276:08.55]It's pretty much certain.
[276:09.51]Oh, wicked bad nerd neck.
[276:11.19]Is that me?
[276:12.84]I think that's me.
[276:14.86]What do you think you're doing Faraday?
[276:33.19]The infection has spread across the base.
[276:35.45]All of the organisms have to be destroyed.
[276:37.85]If it reaches the mainland, there's no stopping it.
[276:40.29]Wait, did we just let this guy do whatever... They let him do whatever he wants?
[276:42.87]I'm learning proof that the infection can be controlled.
[276:46.23]No.
[276:47.01]No, that's not possible.
[276:49.21]The results can't be ignored, Doctor.
[276:52.49]I will be remembered as the first successful test subject.
[276:55.45]No.
[276:56.39]Not if I can help it.
[276:57.21]I don't need your help.
[277:08.51]Never turn your back to somebody right before you say, not before I can help it.
[277:16.63]You'd think you'd want to have a detention focus elsewhere.
[277:28.23]He still would have got shot, but he would have been able to like lunge for the gun.
[277:41.04]Where's my friend?
[277:41.52]I got nothing.
[277:47.38]Medibay power.
[277:48.14]Turn it on.
[277:49.38]Hey.
[277:51.86]You.
[277:52.12]The guy- The person with the gun.
[277:54.58]You- Are you- Are you in a prison cell with a gun?
[278:04.50]Who the fuck is that?
[278:10.94]I probably should have looked in the window of the door.
[278:14.57]That would have been smart.
[278:15.89]Hey, can you help me please?
[278:22.61]Hey!
[278:23.41]Hey!
[278:23.67]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[278:25.23]Do something!
[278:27.45]Help me!
[278:28.69]Do something!
[278:30.30]Do something!
[278:31.56]Attack this person!
[278:33.76]It's a-
[278:39.84]There's no bullets in the gun!
[278:46.57]What are you doing?
[278:47.59]What are you doing in here?
[278:51.27]Why would you be in here with a- What a fucking weirdo.
[279:03.54]Okay, so first things first.
[279:06.70]Look through the window first.
[279:09.82]And... I wouldn't have seen it anyways.
[279:24.70]He's just pretending to have this gun.
[279:29.20]Why are you in there with a gun in the first place?
[279:33.54]Okay, so I can open this one or that one.
[279:35.84]There he is.
[279:36.90]This scary monster.
[279:44.95]I would laugh so hard if he just, like, swiped a keycard.
[279:47.83]And just, like, walked by this guy.
[279:49.72]And they, like, nodded at each other.
[279:56.52]Okay, well, this is the- I have to time this.
[280:13.13]There's a lot of people around, okay.
[280:18.00]Wait, code?
[280:20.73]Is that a Boston accent?
[280:26.21]Kind of sounded like it.
[280:31.73]Uh, initial bio profile of test subject 873 suggests a high risk of cellular rejection if implanted with the B4 strand of the cloud virus.
[280:40.17]This is by no means conclusive, but it leads me to think that subject 873 chief medical researcher, Jen Inc.
[280:47.59]What?
[280:50.53]Oh.
[280:51.79]But it leads me to think that subject 873 may not be suitable due to illness and company status.
[281:00.81]So I've got to wait until he's out of the way.
[281:05.14]He's turning the corner now.
[281:08.26]And we open the door right next to me right here.
[281:10.56]Let's go.
[281:13.44]Get whatever I need out of here.
[281:14.44]Let's go.
[281:14.74]Fix it.
[281:21.51]Oh, shit.
[281:22.53]What does that do?
[281:28.10]Hey.
[281:30.70]Does this give me the fucking finger?
[281:33.72]Why are you flipping me off?
[281:44.83]If I could haymaker right now, I would.
[281:47.75]Okay.
[281:49.57]Well, good to see you.
[282:12.05]And who is in control of this?
[282:25.26]Um, I guess it's preoccupied.
[282:28.42]Oh, I pressed the button.
[282:30.80]I did that.
[282:31.54]I did that.
[282:35.20]That's what that was.
[282:46.56]The part that this computer explode?
[283:05.36]I can't go in there.
[283:16.04]Oh, fuck.
[283:16.54]I don't have a weapon.
[283:22.04]Wait, let's get ammo.
[283:22.82]I got ammo.
[283:23.38]I got ammo.
[283:23.84]I got ammo.
[283:24.28]I got ammo.

[283:25.16]Close the door.
[283:27.08]Hey!
[283:28.53]I got something for you.
[283:30.01]How much ammo do you have?
[283:37.87]Here.

[284:11.60]J.F.
[284:12.16]Blake has been under observation for a few hours now.
[284:14.73]Due to his combat training, he is being considered as extremely high risk, so the security gates have been set to recognize his DNA sequence.
[284:26.01]His DNA sequence.
[284:27.73]The gates will sound the alarm if he passes through and activate the automatic defense systems.
[284:33.62]All other personnel can pass through the gate without tripping the alarm.
[284:37.82]The only problem is the malfunctioning gate in the armory which should be fixed soon.
[284:46.28]Who is?
[284:46.68]Can you open this door?
[285:04.17]I'm getting really sick of the saloon shootout that is just on my ears right now, permanently.
[285:18.87]Okay.
[285:20.15]Sir!
[285:21.51]Excuse me.
[285:29.74]Do you have any healing?
[285:31.64]Medic.
[285:31.98]Are you following me?
[285:32.82]Alright, security room.
[285:33.82]Just watch out for the never-ending firing that's going on over here.
[285:36.26]I gotta...
[286:07.70]I don't know what's happening.
[286:12.06]All I hear is fucking battlefield.
[286:17.56]Can we stop the firing?
[286:24.23]Can you... Do you have any bullets?
[286:28.27]Get over here.
[286:28.99]You.
[286:29.19]You don't have any bullets left.
[286:31.23]Alright, but get over here.
[286:32.67]I need you to open this door.
[286:34.54]Can you open this door?
[286:37.90]This is the security door.
[286:40.00]Get it open.
[286:42.86]You just... stay.
[286:46.70]Okay.
[286:47.46]All of us.

[287:06.97]Can you go through this?
[287:08.85]Okay, you can go through this.
[287:10.27]You're a personnel.
[287:14.39]Just crouch.
[287:16.81]No, that's going to go through my eyes.
[287:19.45]Okay, hold on.
[287:21.78]You go to... No.
[287:27.10]Just jump over the counter.
[287:31.24]Yes, I do.
[287:32.22]I've been hearing it.
[287:33.38]Can you shoot this...
[287:36.50]Alright, how do I get you to go through this?
[287:38.92]You work here.
[287:39.64]Go through that.
[287:43.28]Okay, now go pick that stuff up.
[287:47.99]You work here.
[287:48.57]Turn around and get that stuff over there.
[287:57.23]Over there.
[288:02.38]DNA analyzed.
[288:04.32]Captain J.F.
[288:05.58]Blake.
[288:05.94]DNA analyzed.
[288:10.08]I work here too.
[288:11.66]Okay, cool.
[288:14.90]Alright, wait, wait, there's guns over here.
[288:20.58]What the hell is that?
[288:24.27]Both of you, get over here.
[288:26.37]Where'd he go?
[288:26.85]Hey!
[288:27.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[288:28.27]Come here.
[288:30.71]Follow me, let's go, in here.
[288:32.51]It's safe in here for a minute.
[288:36.17]We- all of us are gonna have a weapon.
[288:40.89]I promise.
[288:41.89]Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay right here.
[288:43.31]Okay, what do you got?
[288:44.53]I'm gonna give you... Um... Pistol.
[288:48.96]And all the pistol ammo.
[288:50.66]You seem like a... guy that... is good with your hands.
[288:55.14]Is an engineer, so he can use the pistol.
[288:58.96]I- that doesn't make any fucking sense.
[289:02.56]A chef could do that, too.
[289:04.10]A chef is good with their hands.
[289:05.08]Okay, so you, I'm going to give you ammo.
[289:14.49]Alright, that's good.
[289:16.53]And I will be the flamethrower guy.
[289:18.27]Just stalk up.
[289:21.39]What is this?
[289:21.75]I have a taser?
[289:22.71]No, actually, come here, both of you.
[289:25.53]You're going to get infinity ammo.
[289:26.37]Yeah, come here.
[289:29.91]You're going to get infinity ammo.
[289:33.57]Oh, you got infinite ammo.
[289:34.81]Cool.
[289:35.57]Alright, let me fill up this.
[289:41.78]And I got full... Okay, how do I use the taser?
[289:50.90]Can I tase people?
[289:54.07]Alright, I'm ready.
[289:55.79]I'm ready to burn the guy.
[289:57.45]Everybody follow me.
[290:00.51]I'm gonna torch him.
[290:03.84]You guys... You're freaking me out.
[290:06.82]Get over here.
[290:08.28]You guys stay here.
[290:13.37]You're just gonna cause a problem.
[290:17.81]Why are you shooting me?
[290:27.75]I gave you an order.
[290:29.25]I told you to stay.
[290:31.83]And I know you just saved my life.
[290:34.59]But you broke command.
[290:40.63]Don't do that again.
[290:42.61]I'll be fine.
[290:44.81]Hey!
[290:45.29]Oh, I can just turn that off.
[291:02.16]Imagine if we just walked forward.
[291:05.06]Just getting lit the fuck up.
[291:06.36]All three of us.
[291:07.02]It would have been horrible.
[291:08.25]Because there's no... I don't have a save point.
[291:11.50]I'm tasing this guy when he opens the door.
[291:29.36]There's a note on the ground.
[291:30.72]I can hear things at night that freak me out.
[291:32.40]It's all so weird.
[291:33.22]People are disappearing all the time.
[291:35.08]But I don't know why.
[291:36.49]What are they doing to us?
[291:37.61]Why have I been detained?
[291:39.29]I've got to get out of this place.
[291:40.39]There's a panel at the back of my cell which might lead to an air vent.
[291:44.69]If only I could break it down.
[291:46.73]That's all the information I needed.
[291:52.81]What?
[291:54.67]What?
[291:58.89]You know this guy?
[292:03.13]It's an AR infected.
[292:04.27]Did anybody know this guy?
[292:05.13]I'm chasing him!
[292:10.85]Alright!
[292:15.33]Don't!
[292:15.61]No!
[292:15.81]Alright, we're good.
[292:18.10]Did he get hit?
[292:19.00]Alright, he's alright.
[292:25.58]It's always the people that stand completely fucking still.
[292:27.68]Looks like I need an access code.
[292:29.46]Access code.
[292:39.77]I might be able to deactivate the security gate with the correct switch sequence.
[292:43.67]Alright.
[292:46.64]Here comes a puzzle.
[293:17.53]Oh my god!
[293:19.27]No!
[293:23.49]Security status Amber in sectors 1 to 5.
[293:47.18]Fuck.
[293:48.98]Why did that happen?
[293:50.38]That's such bullshit.
[294:07.13]I don't even remember.
[294:11.95]I don't remember even the chain of events that happened.
[294:16.81]Oh, that sucks so bad.
[294:19.43]I don't have any guns.
[294:23.92]I did this wrong.
[294:24.90]I did this wrong.
[294:25.32]I did this wrong.
[294:28.22]I... Just kill me.
[294:33.26]Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.
[294:39.62]Come on.
[294:39.90]Just keep throwing baseballs at me.
[294:41.66]Come on.
[294:53.86]Oh, I'm so defeated.
[294:56.06]I can't believe it.
[294:57.02]Okay.
[294:57.74]I can do it again.
[294:58.96]I know everything.
[294:59.62]I know what to do.
[295:01.42]I know what to do.
[295:02.02]I know the chain of events.
[295:02.74]I know how it works.
[295:03.86]Hack the computer.
[295:05.04]No.
[295:05.22]I gotta turn the power on in this room.
[295:07.66]Okay.
[295:08.10]First things first.
[295:08.70]Power activate this room.
[295:10.00]You got it.
[295:15.41]That sucks.
[295:16.63]Okay.
[295:16.99]Now, wait for you.
[295:19.19]Where are you right now?
[295:20.95]Crossing pack.
[295:21.85]I'm gonna wait till you go this way.
[295:24.28]Yep.
[295:24.90]Instantly shoot this person in the head.
[295:27.31]Right?
[295:27.77]I've got it all.
[295:29.33]I'm ready.
[295:31.19]So we open this door and just headshot this guy.
[295:36.79]Here we go.
[295:42.05]Grab the ammo.
[295:47.86]Turn on the minigun.
[295:54.40]What?
[295:55.66]Oh, shit.
[295:57.74]He can't open doors, right?
[296:15.05]That's so... His, like, turning around the corner and then... It's almost like he was armed, like he had a gun.
[296:25.10]Okay, here you go.
[296:27.54]Yes.
[296:28.40]I'm ready.
[296:29.60]Follow me, please.
[296:31.16]Take my gun.
[296:32.24]Take my ammo.
[296:32.80]Because you're not going to let me take it from you.
[296:34.24]Because you'll be mad.
[296:35.06]Okay.
[296:36.60]Sounds good.
[296:37.78]You're a medic.
[296:38.90]Follow me.
[296:39.28]We need to go.
[296:44.51]You need to kill these things.
[296:46.93]Do your best.
[296:50.37]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[296:52.83]Good work.
[296:54.13]Okay.
[296:55.89]New power.
[296:58.25]Activate.
[297:02.76]We're good.
[297:03.22]Remember the note?
[297:06.70]Yes, I do.
[297:08.12]Hey, look at this.
[297:08.98]I've got a light.
[297:13.08]Hello.
[297:13.38]Need a heal?
[297:14.66]Take care of him.
[297:22.62]Alright.
[297:27.86]Very cool.
[297:29.91]Dixon.
[297:31.53]Valchik.
[297:32.01]Valchik.
[297:32.41]Dixon.
[297:33.27]We've been acquainted.
[297:34.39]Let's go.
[297:39.69]Killed him.
[297:42.68]Good.
[297:43.32]Killed him.
[297:49.44]Will you kill it before...
[297:53.22]Give me the fucking gun.
[297:54.74]Give me the gun.
[297:55.64]Give me the gun.
[297:56.70]Give me the gun.
[297:57.50]Just give me the gun.
[298:00.96]Give me the gun.
[298:01.72]You've wasted all the ammo.
[298:06.49]Come on.
[298:12.19]I need you to open this door.
[298:13.07]Yes, please open that.
[298:28.89]Nice work.
[298:31.21]Hey, look.
[298:32.75]Is that a tester?
[298:35.94]No, it's adrenaline.
[298:38.12]Alright.
[298:39.58]We're back where we were before.
[298:41.08]Get in here.
[299:01.86]I thought he just turned.
[299:02.72]I was about to be so upset.
[299:06.15]Okay.
[299:10.81]You know, you guys could pick this shit up too.
[299:14.33]Why does it have to be me every time?
[299:21.44]Alright, you.
[299:22.28]Dixon.
[299:23.73]I want to give you the... Let's go ahead and give you the machine gun.
[299:30.90]Yep.
[299:31.54]I'm going to be flamethrower guy.
[299:33.00]I want double machine gun fire.
[299:36.56]Pistol is fucking absolutely useless.
[299:39.30]Like, why would anybody use the pistol?
[299:49.57]I know.
[299:49.81]I'm working on it.
[299:50.35]I'm working on it.
[299:51.25]Here.
[299:51.43]Now we're better friends.
[299:54.94]Here.
[299:56.97]Take ammo.
[300:00.27]Everybody good.
[300:00.91]Everybody has the most ammo they can possibly hold.
[300:05.23]I'm gonna do it too, in case one of you guys turns, and I'm gonna take it back.
[300:10.22]Okay.
[300:11.62]It's time to go.
[300:18.02]Both of you stay.
[300:19.66]In fact, don't even come out of this room.
[300:25.27]What?
[300:25.75]The fucking computer exploded.
[300:29.33]That... He's getting knocked all the way back.
[300:59.26]Okay.
[301:00.91]Back where we were before.
[301:03.55]Hi, guys.
[301:04.69]I'm back to refill.
[301:05.89]I could also use a little bit of a heal.
[301:09.83]If you got a second.
[301:11.79]Thank you.
[301:14.47]This is grenades on the ground?
[301:15.73]No.
[301:16.05]Alright, I'm full.
[301:18.28]Let's move.
[301:20.83]No more fucking around.
[301:22.41]Alright.
[301:23.31]Who?
[301:24.17]Shoot this guy right in the head.
[301:27.49]I have a handgun.
[301:28.57]I'm just gonna open the door and put it right in his forehead.
[301:33.83]What are you doing?
[301:46.86]Hi.
[301:47.82]We'd like to come in.
[301:51.14]It didn't- he waved.
[302:01.73]He's waving.
[302:10.70]Ah.
[302:14.10]I hit him in the shoulder.
[302:16.00]I didn't even get him in the fucking head.
[302:17.46]And then this guy, like, turned it up to 100.
[302:22.56]Thank you for the help, though.
[302:23.46]Seriously, like, I want this guy around.
[302:25.58]Seriously.
[302:26.18]Like, that's one of the only people that listened to me.
[302:29.63]I shot the guy.
[302:31.13]You didn't do anything.
[302:31.99]He did.
[302:32.81]He helped.
[302:35.01]I am terrified to do this.
[302:36.79]I'm not going to do it until I know for certain what the hell the code is.
[302:42.01]There's gotta be, like, a code that I need, that I... It's like, oh, it's up, down, left, right, whatever.
[302:48.20]One, two, four, three.
[302:49.66]Alright, I'm gonna let you guys shoot, because... Don't.
[302:59.00]I hope you don't turn.
[303:00.22]You still, you know, no one's been hit.
[303:05.07]Save point.
[303:08.46]That's so painful that this was right here.
[303:10.26]If I just went this way first.
[303:12.24]That's so painful.
[303:14.46]It's alright, though.
[303:18.92]Lots of health.
[303:21.87]How we doing on health?
[303:22.67]I think everyone's good, but I don't know.
[303:23.83]I have max health now.
[303:26.99]Code?
[303:27.55]For the computer?
[303:34.43]Not functioning gate and armory sector.
[303:37.25]They're all for me.
[303:40.57]What is this?
[303:40.93]What are we looking at here?
[303:48.96]I'm not sure what we're looking at here.
[303:50.66]This is the camera that was over here.
[303:57.98]Whatever that means.
[304:02.07]Is this a gun?
[304:05.29]This is a gun, right?
[304:07.37]Oh fuck, it's a gun.

[304:32.36]And then... I think I'm gonna open all the... Okay, remember where this is.
[304:44.20]Yep, okay, I know what's gonna happen.
[304:46.12]I'm gonna... Okay, I need to remember who this is.
[304:58.54]But what on Earth?
[305:02.86]What's wrong?
[305:04.22]Which one of you is doing it?
[305:05.87]Who's turning?
[305:18.79]No, I don't actually.
[305:19.89]I did.
[305:23.44]Who's them?
[305:33.50]We can't get in here.
[305:36.86]You can't fix that?
[306:00.98]Here we go.
[306:02.04]It's not three.
[306:08.84]Two.
[306:10.92]Alright, you wanna fu- They're just on the elevator.
[306:22.79]They're just waiting on the elevator for somebody to fuck up that puzzle.
[306:34.93]Alright, fuck it, let's go.
[306:38.06]I already know all this stuff.
[306:39.18]I already know all this.
[306:41.88]Just do the fucking... just brute force the puzzle.
[306:47.63]Nobody else, right?
[306:50.69]Wait a minute.
[306:52.71]Alright, hold on, I'm going.
[306:55.07]What an idiot.
[306:55.73]Get him.
[307:03.75]One.
[307:05.61]Four.
[307:08.04]Three.
[307:08.92]Two.
[307:23.23]So I've got it wrong every single fucking way.
[307:27.63]There's a hair in my mouth.
[307:29.07]I think I just swallowed it.
[307:39.52]Pull it out quick.
[307:40.08]You can never get it.
[307:43.07]It's too hard to get the first time.
[307:45.37]If you don't get it immediately, you're swallowing that here.
[307:47.47]It's just the way it is.
[307:52.11]One.
[307:56.38]One.
[307:57.82]Four.
[307:58.12]What?
[308:01.22]What?
[308:11.51]Wait, what?
[308:13.53]Get outta here!
[308:26.27]It was a new batch.
[308:29.99]Did I do it the wrong- how did I do it wrong?
[308:32.12]1, 4, 2, 3?
[308:37.67]Did I screw that up?
[308:52.98]I did?
[308:53.38]1, 4.
[309:06.23]There's four switches.
[309:07.61]There's four switches.
[309:11.97]It's every video game that's ever been a video game.
[309:16.74]You have to get them in the right sequence.
[309:18.12]All of them.
[309:32.67]It is very secure.
[309:33.65]Let's go.
[309:47.07]Open the door.
[309:50.11]Okay.
[309:51.19]Guys, here's the room.
[309:54.09]I think you guys should go back and stay in the other room.
[310:05.30]Okay.
[310:34.24]Not watching them.
[310:42.91]He was infected.
[310:59.84]Get up!
[311:13.43]I thought it was going to be way more- it's like two or three little guys.
[311:16.03]Okay.
[311:23.41]See, I ran back because I thought it was going to be, oh, watch out, the room fills with a ton of enemies.
[311:27.01]He'll do it.
[311:46.98]I cured him.
[311:50.99]They both started to go like...
[312:08.82]I'm getting increasingly worried about the mental state of Commander Whitley.
[312:13.09]I believe that he was injected himself with a B4 strain of the cloud virus even after I personally refused him after the tests.
[312:19.98]I currently have him under observation and his behavior is becoming unpredictable.
[312:24.22]In addition to this, I am getting varied reports about his behavior from different security personnel.
[312:28.90]I'm not sure whom to trust on this and may have to issue a request for termination if things get out of hand.
[312:34.52]The experiments on test subject 874, Blake, have proved inconclusive where there seems to be a minute trace of a cellular anomaly that could be related to the cloud virus.
[312:45.87]I will need to do further tests as the subject has an unusual amount of exposure to the virus in its many forms.
[312:51.97]That's me.
[312:55.74]Why are you hiding back there?
[313:03.19]Cell 1.
[313:05.43]Cell 10.
[313:05.71]That's my cell.
[313:15.97]Hmm.
[313:18.88]Interesting.
[313:21.86]What else we got here?
[313:23.06]Signs, bullshit, whatever that is.
[313:33.93]I don't- I can't hold the fire down.
[313:39.29]You know what?
[313:39.61]Get up the stairs.
[313:40.79]Get up here, and let me just block this off, please.
[313:56.55]Wow, you are very, very, very, very particular.
[314:11.79]There.
[314:14.39]Quality pathfinding.
[314:15.79]That was just like, I'm gonna go this way and that's it.
[314:22.02]Alright, you're starting to piss me off a little bit with your killing me.
[314:28.16]Heal me.
[314:29.30]I demand it.
[314:30.22]I demand it as your commander.

[315:25.37]You want a taser?
[315:29.88]Are you alright?
[315:31.52]Fisk.
[315:33.78]Do I have a tester?
[315:39.28]It took him like a full 15 seconds to answer.
[315:46.04]I can't give him the taser.
[315:47.61]You can take the handgun.
[315:50.43]Don't make me regret that.
[315:54.49]Do I have a tester?
[315:56.37]We're good.
[316:17.24]I got a whole party now.
[316:28.61]Follow me!
[316:31.29]Okay.

[317:38.24]But... Follow me, I guess.
[317:43.86]Alright.
[317:49.18]He's looking at me so strangely.
[317:51.18]He hasn't said a word.
[317:52.12]Of course he's a fucking alien.
[318:04.67]Shoot him!
[318:08.97]Yeah?
[318:09.77]Are you gonna?

[318:32.31]Alright, let's go through the cell.
[318:36.79]And Stanmore is a fake alien name.
[318:41.57]We do?
[318:45.82]Is it you pretending to be a bad guy?
[318:50.95]What are they aiming at?
[318:52.73]You ran by it.
[318:53.73]Alright, let's go.
[318:54.95]Before you guys do anything stupid, let's get out of here.
[318:58.87]Get that open, please!
[319:03.30]I need someone to shoot this.
[319:08.90]Wait, what?
[319:12.91]No.
[319:13.51]Where's our... Get over here.
[319:15.45]I need a gun.
[319:19.13]I know I just gave that to you, but I need it for two seconds.
[319:21.23]Give it back.
[319:23.03]You're hurt.
[319:23.85]Uh-oh.
[319:29.11]You're actually very hurt.
[319:31.53]Come here.
[319:31.77]Alright, you're good.
[319:38.50]Thanks.
[319:43.04]You can have this back.
[319:50.74]Good.
[319:52.84]How are you doing on ammo?
[319:55.74]Good.
[319:57.80]Alright, guys.
[319:58.62]Yes.
[319:58.86]Where'd he go?
[320:01.18]Where'd you go?
[320:01.58]Where'd you go?
[320:03.02]Don't.
[320:03.58]Please.
[320:05.42]I'm just trying to keep track of everybody.
[320:06.95]Once there's more than like three of you, it's hard.
[320:10.29]Okay.
[320:11.49]Let's go.
[320:11.77]I need my...
[320:14.52]Flashlight.
[320:16.73]Get over here!
[320:18.09]Where are you going?
[320:20.29]Stop, please!
[320:21.37]He's freaking me out.
[320:35.62]He's an alien.
[320:36.30]Only aliens would do that.
[320:37.60]I think that guy is an alien.
[320:39.20]I really do.
[320:41.62]Come on.
[320:44.77]All of you need to get in here.
[320:52.25]What are they doing?
[320:57.93]Do you guys not understand how to crouch?
[321:02.96]Get over here.
[321:13.44]I'll probably have to open... Well, now any of them could be aliens because I just left them all.
[321:27.68]They don't climb ladders, do they?
[321:31.94]No.
[321:40.96]Is that all that's in there?
[321:43.44]Okay.
[321:44.73]How am I going to do this?
[321:47.57]Sure wish I had a couple of people to be here with me to do this.
[321:52.39]It'd be great if there were three people with a ton of weapons.
[321:56.25]Because now I have to time this and it's not going to... He's in the corner.
[321:59.01]Idiot.
[322:01.56]Come on.
[322:02.00]I just made him angry.
[322:12.61]Alright.
[322:13.29]Into the same... He's blocking... He blocked himself off.
[322:16.25]I just have to deal with one.
[322:17.13]Get it right in the middle.
[322:18.93]Bang!
[322:19.21]Right there!
[322:21.10]Yes!
[322:23.48]Oh, I got them both.
[322:24.90]I got them both.
[322:28.68]Excellent.
[322:29.78]Oh, that's... I feel so satisfied.
[322:32.74]Alright, now it's just a question of... How am I gonna go down this?
[322:36.57]Is this gonna hurt me?
[322:50.32]Hey!
[322:50.88]Where the fuck are you?
[322:51.98]Okay.
[323:02.08]That was a pretty good toss, I will say.
[323:04.71]Can I fix this?
[323:05.35]Nope.
[323:15.97]I wonder if I'm going to have a team after this.
[323:21.08]Well.
[323:22.82]Okay, guys.
[323:24.26]I need you to come... You know how upset I'm going to be.
[323:32.98]There they are.
[323:33.36]All three of them.
[323:37.38]Okay.
[323:37.84]Cool.
[323:39.94]Nice job.
[323:40.40]Let's save it.
[323:41.30]Everyone's around still.
[323:43.22]That's good.
[323:44.64]Alright.
[323:45.44]Cool.
[323:46.24]That's great.
[323:48.12]And I got full health here.
[323:49.78]And I'm going to go back to the room with the ammo.
[323:54.22]And we're going to fill up again.
[323:59.13]Where was that room?
[324:03.23]Over here?
[324:07.83]Come over here.
[324:10.64]I've got ammo for you guys.
[324:15.07]Alright, who needs it?
[324:17.07]I'm just going to give you all of it.
[324:18.83]You already have it all.
[324:19.87]What about you?
[324:21.38]I already have it all.
[324:25.68]What about you?
[324:30.07]full refill I'll take it and if anybody anybody dies I'll take your gun because I'll have full ammo speaking of ammo I've got full fire save the game again Jerm is infected I am not infected
[325:00.26]Okay, so now I can go this way and you hopefully can open the door that is... No, not this way over here.
[325:08.84]Open the door.
[325:11.70]If you will.
[325:14.58]No, it's not this way.
[325:15.52]Which way was it?
[325:16.96]Is it the smoky hallway?
[325:18.48]Where's that smoky hallway?
[325:24.30]There it is.
[325:30.36]Over here.
[325:32.12]One, two, three.
[325:32.72]I need you to open this door.
[325:37.67]Go get it.
[325:43.65]You can tell that Jerm is infected because his pathfinding is so bad.
[325:51.45]I did say that earlier, so that's not inaccurate.
[325:54.73]So that turned on these computers.
[325:59.61]We're gonna get slam dunked on here.
[326:02.41]Request access code for elevator is 2710.
[326:04.51]Oh, there it is.
[326:06.19]Alright, here comes the... We're gonna get collapsed on.
[326:12.12]Let's be ready.
[326:14.08]I'm surprised none of you have turned yet.
[326:21.33]Usually that happens to me.
[326:27.09]I actually feel fairly safe right now.
[326:30.51]You guys all have weapons?
[326:33.43]Alright, here we go.
[326:36.25]Let's do it.
[326:47.05]What was that?
[326:49.25]No!
[326:49.73]This stuff over here!
[326:51.07]Oh, it's just a machine gun.
[327:00.91]Alright guys.
[327:05.85]It's time for the squad.
[327:10.96]Get in there.
[327:12.88]Excellent job.

[327:27.59]No.
[327:28.99]Gumshoe is what they call people and where in the world is Karma San Diego?
[327:32.35]You've got whatever it's called.
[327:34.09]Uh-oh.
[327:38.94]Turn it off.
[327:42.86]Who did that?
[327:43.46]Did I do that?
[327:49.06]Oh, it's opening and closing the door.
[327:51.68]Get in here.
[327:53.54]Wait.
[327:57.35]There could be items.

[331:18.52]This is one way to go.
[331:20.22]Down here.

[339:14.40]He's outrunning the bullets.
[339:21.90]That's impossible.
[339:34.91]Is that it?
[339:41.43]I think that's it.
[339:49.41]Alright.
[339:50.66]Alrighty.

[340:13.71]Fire extinguisher.
[340:16.15]But what in the name of fucking god?
[340:18.34]You gotta fix that.
[340:22.30]There are people that can outrun that in real life.
[340:27.80]I just like was so shocked at what you said that my teeth hit hard together and I just hurt my mouth.
[340:35.93]Nobody can outrun a fucking minigun.
[340:43.39]I do not believe you.
[340:45.13]Freddy Dredd just gave 10,000 bits, but I can't read what it said.
[340:54.03]Somebody copy and paste it.
[340:55.25]Thank you, Freddie Dredd.
[341:03.39]What'd it say?
[341:03.85]Didn't say anything.
[341:04.59]No, there's no message.
[341:07.40]It was blank.
[341:12.22]Well, thanks for the fucking hundred dollars.
[341:14.24]Holy shit.
[341:17.67]Alright, let's fix this.
[341:20.17]I'm going to give you the... Wait.

[341:41.36]Shit.
[341:44.52]Shit.
[341:46.47]I don't have any bullets for the shotgun.
[341:49.33]You're gonna be useless.
[341:57.43]I have to pick up another weapon for you.
[341:59.17]Because you're not good right now.
[342:01.55]I'm like using the gun that you would be using normally.
[342:05.93]Okay.
[342:07.37]You see what I mean?
[342:08.39]I gotta find another gun on the ground.
[342:12.51]The guards drop shotgun rounds?
[342:16.43]Well, I'm ready.
[342:17.63]Let's move.
[342:20.43]If they do, they do.
[342:21.34]If they don't, then they don't.

[343:02.56]Yes, sir.
[343:04.02]Yes, sir.
[343:05.60]Okay.

[344:34.45]Okay.
[344:34.59]I think we're all gonna be machine gun psychos.
[344:37.93]Yeah, we're machine gunners.
[344:44.24]Yeah.
[344:46.64]I'd rather it be like that.
[344:56.33]Fuck.

[345:18.06]Oh, boy.
[345:20.00]Or burn the hallway.
[345:21.56]I don't know.
[345:27.74]Save the game.
[345:37.50]How do I get in there?
[345:47.69]Um... There was a fire started in the vent.
[345:51.65]Could you use the flamethrower to activate it?
[345:56.03]I... I'm gonna...
[345:59.42]Everybody stay here.
[346:01.32]All of you.
[346:02.60]This is a mission for me.
[346:07.38]Okay.
[346:07.98]Don't go anywhere.
[346:09.04]Stay right there.
[346:10.74]Keep an eye on each other.
[346:14.62]Alright.

[347:09.52]You'll just have to imagine the fire.
[347:14.39]Activate the turret last.
[347:15.47]I'm so scared because I don't want to screw this up.
[347:19.33]When I landed last time, it just started.
[347:23.81]I think I'm just going to run.
[347:25.43]I don't... Well, now I have to.
[347:34.84]Get out of the fucking way!
[347:41.34]I just closed the door!

[347:48.59]Where are my friends?
[347:51.05]How do I get the door?
[347:51.93]Friends?
[347:53.09]Oh, shit.
[347:55.37]Okay, everybody slow down.
[348:02.99]Okay.
[348:04.87]I can't- I need to turn the power on.
[348:10.19]Don't activate him and pull him here.
[348:12.09]Okay.
[348:14.15]The friends.
[348:14.77]Okay.
[348:17.93]Oh my god, what's in here?
[348:20.81]Well, this is like a safe room.
[348:25.26]Okay, can I like torch them or something?
[348:28.74]The fire is coming down the hallway right now.
[348:33.54]The fire doesn't go in this room, right?
[348:37.39]Activate the switches.
[348:38.59]What?
[348:45.13]He's not leaving, is he?
[348:51.20]Okay, those open the doors.
[348:54.20]But what does this do?
[348:58.71]I'm afraid to do anything.
[349:01.91]I'm afraid I can just kill him.
[349:05.26]I'm just gonna kill him.
[349:06.46]I'm gonna kill him.
[349:08.42]I'm gonna activate switch one and I'm gonna kill him.
[349:14.28]Or... You can't.
[349:17.78]Yes, I can.
[349:20.81]Can I turn this out?
[349:21.89]Okay, hold on.
[349:47.40]What's this?
[349:52.01]Candy cane grenade.
[349:55.75]What's a candy cane grenade?
[349:58.33]High explosive grenade.
[349:59.59]I can kill them.
[350:02.81]I'm going for it.
[350:08.91]What else am I gonna do?
[350:09.60]I just gotta open up one...
[350:17.43]And that will... Wait, there's like poison or something in here.
[350:22.05]Look at... Hold on.
[350:25.08]I think I can... I think I can kill them.
[350:26.80]So three is the door.
[350:29.50]But... Alright.
[350:29.86]What if I go this way?
[350:53.55]Flip them all.
[350:54.19]I can't even activate them.
[350:57.87]Get out of my way.
[351:04.44]What are you doing?
[351:07.90]Those things are so annoying.
[351:19.86]Did I just, like, activate a boss?
[351:22.68]Alright.
[351:23.84]I... Where am I?
[351:33.49]No.
[351:38.05]I gotta go get my friends.
[351:39.13]I can't... I'm just gonna go fight those two things by myself.
[351:43.32]Is there a save point?
[351:56.37]Fuck.
[352:01.94]Why?
[352:02.72]God damn it.
[352:43.71]No.
[353:24.19]Hold still and I'll fix you up.
[353:44.73]No, not over here yet.
[353:46.19]Wrong way.
[353:46.96]I need grenades.
[354:00.31]I don't even know who's on my team.
[354:07.63]What the fuck is going on?
[354:13.15]Get in here, everybody, please.
[354:14.49]I'm deja vu.
[354:16.87]You know why I have deja vu?
[354:18.29]Because I've done this five fucking times.
[354:20.09]Give me another machine gun.
[354:41.12]Alright, you pansy.
[354:43.67]What do you mean he doesn't know?
[354:44.51]Anybody know how far into the game I am right now?
[354:53.27]85%?
[354:53.29]There's only like 20 minutes left?
[355:16.37]75%?
[355:16.39]80%?
[355:16.41]Okay, we're safe.
[355:17.27]Here we go.
[355:24.20]Now I'm gonna heal you, because you need to be healed, and that's what we do.
[355:27.64]We take care of each other.
[355:29.46]You've been healed.
[355:30.78]You need to be healed again.
[355:32.56]Wow, the medic can't just stick a syringe in his own mouth and swallow it.
[355:39.63]Okay.
[355:39.77]Okay.
[355:41.73]We're going to do this again, except this time I'm going ham.
[355:45.19]I'm going to go for it, and I'm going to kill those two antlions.
[355:49.99]They're going to die.
[355:50.71]If you don't know what ham means, look it up.
[356:04.77]Again, we're going to give everybody the items that they should have.
[356:07.97]I should have the machine gun.
[356:09.21]You can have the pistol.
[356:10.87]Until I find one.
[356:12.65]You... I'm actually going to run all the way back and I'm going to save the game.
[356:18.78]That's what's going to happen.
[356:25.34]Okay.
[356:27.22]We're going to save the game now.
[356:33.81]I'm not going this way, I'm going back- wait, we have to go in the elevator.
[356:44.62]Can we go back?
[356:48.68]I don't know if we can go back up.
[356:52.70]We can't.
[356:53.66]You can't save it.
[356:56.05]Just use the stairs.
[357:00.31]I would.
[357:01.71]Okay.
[357:05.38]Let's go.
[357:20.87]Good.
[357:26.77]He bounced off his head.
[357:27.77]Okay.
[357:29.57]This is important.
[357:31.61]Don't let him do this.
[357:51.46]He got it?
[357:53.83]No, he didn't.
[357:58.83]It's not scripted.
[357:59.61]It wasn't on last time.
[358:07.92]Use a grenade?
[358:10.47]I don't think I can do it from here.
[358:12.13]I have to cook it for, like, four and a half seconds.
[358:15.26]One.
[358:16.12]Two.
[358:17.12]Three.
[358:25.64]One.
[358:26.54]Two.
[358:27.48]Three.
[358:28.86]Oh, fuck!
[358:29.89]That's not gonna happen.
[358:30.67]That's not gonna happen.
[358:31.19]That's not gonna happen.
[358:31.93]That's not gonna happen.
[358:32.41]That's not gonna happen.
[358:33.31]You guys stay.
[358:33.93]Stay.
[358:34.17]Get over here.
[358:35.07]I have to do this again, and I gotta go for it.
[358:36.85]I want all of you over here, please.
[358:38.33]All of you.
[358:38.77]Get over here.
[358:40.60]Get the fuck over here.
[358:43.20]Stay.
[358:43.68]All of you.
[358:44.20]Don't move.
[358:45.88]None of you.
[358:47.26]I am ready to... What do I have for heals?
[358:50.48]Why have you not healed me?
[358:55.52]What do I have for health?
[358:56.14]Why have you not healed me?
[359:02.00]Heal me.
[359:07.34]Okay.
[359:13.16]I don't have full health.
[359:14.56]I'm too afraid.
[359:16.98]Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[359:19.36]We're good?
[359:20.96]Okay.
[359:21.80]I said stay, right?
[359:22.66]Good.
[359:24.73]I did, right?
[359:38.28]Here we go.
[359:56.42]I did it again!
[359:57.58]Go ahead.
[360:10.71]Hey.
[360:12.03]Activate the switches.
[360:12.81]I can't.
[360:15.67]High explosive powered grenades.
[360:17.65]We're going to go get them and I'm going to destroy them.
[360:22.21]Okay.
[360:25.17]Okay.
[360:30.69]Get all those.
[360:32.01]This is good to go.
[360:35.30]Give me my fire extinguisher.
[360:37.34]I'm so close to a save point.
[360:38.68]It's right here.
[360:46.45]It's literally right here.
[361:03.89]This is it.
[361:09.73]As many of these as I can carry.
[361:15.12]What about the turret?
[361:19.05]Um... What about the turret?
[361:24.51]What do you mean?
[361:28.61]If I open this door, I have to open three.
[361:33.02]I can't... Wait, I can't even do this.
[361:43.50]I have to open... one.
[361:48.72]But the switches can't be activated.
[361:59.58]Because I need an engineer.
[362:04.36]And I can't save the game.
[362:10.67]Because there's no power.
[362:14.55]And I can't turn the power on because I can't do this.
[362:18.56]So I have to actually go do all this shit over here.
[362:26.74]Can you bring the tech through the vents?
[362:28.38]I don't think they go in the vents with you.
[362:31.64]Alright.
[362:32.56]This is really important.
[362:33.86]I don't want to fuck this up.
[362:35.84]Everything is... There's explosives everywhere.
[362:37.91]I'm already fucking it up.
[362:50.67]Oh, fire.
[362:51.21]Here's fire.
[362:51.83]They fucking hate it.
[363:04.46]Okay.
[363:05.82]One of these doors explodes.
[363:27.06]This one explodes.
[364:01.55]Hey!
[364:02.35]Who's fa- I heard a gun!
[364:03.77]Oh!
[364:37.20]What was that?
[364:40.92]What's that?
[364:43.03]What's that making that...
[365:08.82]Do I do... Are we good?
[365:15.65]Are we good?
[365:19.58]Are we good?
[365:23.40]Did I do it?
[365:24.06]Did I turn it on?
[365:24.78]Did I do it?
[365:40.79]I just released them.
[365:41.59]What?
[365:42.33]What are you talking about?
[365:55.83]One.
[366:00.66]I didn't- what are you talking about?
[366:01.46]I didn't release them?
[366:04.96]This- I still do whatever's going on inside that room!
[366:12.09]Something going on in here now.
[366:13.13]So what the fuck is going on in here?
[366:32.21]I hope they're still waiting for me.
[366:40.74]Vent.
[366:41.78]There's a vent over here.
[366:44.10]What's a vent for?
[366:44.78]I think it's just a bait.
[367:00.77]It's just a bait.
[367:03.82]Really?
[367:05.54]Well, there's another thing to power on.
[367:12.48]um I have a question didn't the game tell me to do this in a certain order or it would be bad right it said do this and it said don't turn this on or pressure tank
[367:44.21]I did it.
[367:44.49]Alright, get me out of this room.
[367:52.84]Okay.
[367:53.90]Can I... Alright, here we go.
[367:57.70]One, right?
[367:59.06]One.
[367:59.58]Is it one?
[368:00.48]It's one.
[368:01.30]One is gonna kill them.
[368:02.10]Good.
[368:19.04]Three opens the door.
[368:19.98]He's hiding in the corner.
[368:23.63]Are you really hiding in the corner?
[368:28.65]How am I on fire?
[368:30.01]Huh?
[368:30.61]What was it?
[368:31.21]Somebody in here.
[368:33.27]Okay, this is good.
[368:34.11]This is good so far.
[368:34.93]So far, so good.
[368:36.45]I have to get that Engineer in here or I softlock the game.
[368:41.06]Remember this, chat.
[368:42.70]If the Engineer does not get in here, it's over.
[368:55.11]Open three.
[369:00.43]Fire extinguisher, I still have some.
[369:07.66]This shit don't turn on again, right?
[369:15.92]This is two.
[369:17.64]How do I turn off the turret?
[369:19.22]They're gonna come down the hall and get fucking obliterated.
[369:43.05]Hey!
[369:44.77]Look at me!
[369:46.04]There it is!
[369:49.96]Guys!
[369:52.68]Hey guys!
[369:53.86]Hey, you're all still here!
[369:55.00]Ain't that good?
[369:55.92]Well, I have a story for you.
[369:58.24]Follow me!
[370:05.28]Hope you guys had some conversations while I was gone.
[370:07.14]What?
[370:07.50]I already did.
[370:17.99]Engineer?
[370:19.47]Wait a- No, are they turning?
[370:24.06]What does that mean?
[370:25.88]That usually means they're infected, right?
[370:28.44]You puked on the guy's body.
[370:30.12]Like, at least fucking take a step to the left.
[370:32.36]Jesus.
[370:34.01]What door is not open?
[370:35.81]That was 1, 2, 3, 4.
[370:37.23]4 is locked.
[370:39.41]Okay, but for the meantime, I ain't doing this yet.
[370:41.75]We're going to turn this on so I can save the game.
[370:45.32]Please.
[370:45.62]Right here.
[370:49.58]I know you're capable.
[370:51.04]Go for it.
[370:56.29]Let there be light, please.
[371:07.20]Thank God.
[371:10.49]Thank goodness.
[371:12.93]How are y'all doing on health and ammo and everything?
[371:14.95]Good?
[371:17.19]Everyone still in good spirits?
[371:25.32]Except for you.
[371:25.88]Well, actually, you were the last to puke.
[371:30.48]That's true.
[371:30.98]You were the last one to puke.
[371:36.26]Here we go, open fort.
[371:41.64]You're not on a job.
[371:44.11]We're just trying to fucking survive, man.
[371:46.03]We're just trying to live right now.
[371:47.65]This is new content.
[371:58.24]He was dumb.
[371:58.68]I think he ran into...
[372:05.79]Stay.
[372:07.42]Where is he?
[372:10.04]Where'd he go?
[372:12.44]Get over here.
[372:13.56]You know, just all of you stay.
[372:15.12]I'll figure it out.
[372:15.76]I'll figure this out.
[372:16.38]Alright, he died trying to press the button.
[372:31.43]Button can't be pressed.
[372:33.19]Are we doing this shit again?
[372:45.87]How can the button not be pressed?
[372:50.00]I'm sick of this shit.
[372:51.98]Fuck off.
[372:59.86]It's safe!
[373:04.65]You're gonna heal.
[373:07.97]These things are huge blast radius, by the way.
[373:11.55]Enormous.
[373:16.10]No, we're not.
[373:16.38]We're fine.
[373:16.74]Uh-oh.
[373:20.62]I don't like how he's not following.
[373:22.46]He's just staying here.
[373:27.38]Follow.
[373:28.86]Stop staying back.
[373:31.75]I'm about to shoot him.
[373:33.19]Like, because this is bad.
[373:34.33]I don't want this to happen.
[373:35.19]Come on, let's go.
[373:37.01]All of you, follow me.
[373:39.49]You too.
[373:39.99]That means you.
[373:40.49]Alright, I'm okay.
[373:46.35]Another way to get softlocked would be right here.
[374:00.41]We're gonna die here.
[374:01.43]Everybody alright?
[374:08.92]It's just a little startling, I know.
[374:12.66]Everyone's good.
[374:16.31]here we go we lost I knew it I knew it I knew he was there was something going on with him he was acting really strange and now he's gone and he took with him like a thousand rounds of ammo
[374:43.06]I am not going to mess around.
[374:44.61]I have high explosive grenades.
[374:45.75]I'm going to throw it into this guy's head.
[374:48.17]One, two, three.
[374:49.81]Please die.
[374:56.81]Please die.
[374:57.96]Please die.
[374:59.04]Please die.
[375:15.98]Medics are okay.
[375:16.52]We can fix this one.
[375:28.23]Okay, you can...
[375:38.70]Uh-oh!
[375:40.38]Oh shit!
[375:40.84]That lets a fire out!
[375:42.22]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[375:48.17]You guys are smart.
[375:55.01]What?
[375:58.50]You guys coming?
[376:21.51]It's just you and me.
[376:25.63]Let's do it.
[376:33.40]I don't have a tester.
[376:36.34]I have no way to tell if you're real or not.
[376:53.87]It's not.
[376:55.63]Do I have to trap something in here and pull the lever?
[377:13.46]Save point.
[377:16.76]Wait.
[377:17.82]I'm so glad you're still here.
[377:19.88]I'm so happy that you're still here.
[377:25.22]Look at how useful you've been.
[377:27.58]You have been so useful.
[377:31.44]Dixon.
[377:33.76]Didn't remember your name.
[377:46.09]You're in bad shape, soldier.
[377:47.89]What happened?
[377:49.03]Whitley.
[377:50.85]He tried to gun me down.
[377:53.54]But he didn't quite finish the job.
[377:59.55]Very dramatic.
[378:01.27]I'm pretty messed up.
[378:07.86]Get me a weapon.
[378:11.30]Thanks.
[378:13.18]We got a new medic.
[378:15.94]I do have a weapon for you.
[378:17.99]It's a shotgun.
[378:20.55]Uh, somebody stole my other weapon, so I can't really do anything about it.
[378:29.31]Hold still and I'll fix you up.
[378:34.49]Please, can you check the results of our second test run to see if they are in line with your specs?
[378:39.67]Thing molecule degradation, 100%.
[378:43.79]Altered strain degradation, 98%.
[378:45.45]Effective energy waste, 1.2%.
[378:47.67]Residual matter, 0.4%.
[378:48.80]These are PC specs.
[378:55.60]If these are not what you are expecting, please update your design and we will run another test in the main armory.
[379:04.54]Alright.
[379:06.48]I'm getting, like, blinky.
[379:07.96]I gotta, like... I feel like I haven't blanked my eyes in, like, an hour and 20 minutes.
[379:17.79]What was that?
[379:18.45]Oh, a rifle.
[379:19.27]I don't even have the rifle anymore, do I?
[379:21.91]No, it was taken from me.
[379:26.61]And it was just replaced right now.
[379:30.27]That's swell.
[379:30.77]That's swell.
[379:34.06]Okay.
[379:35.04]Where's the save point?
[379:36.44]I hear it.
[379:44.33]I hear it.
[379:45.39]What?
[379:45.59]Who is...
[380:02.77]Where's the shotgun?
[380:04.81]Did you just shoot him?
[380:06.25]You just shot him twice.
[380:10.22]You fucking idiot.
[380:11.72]What an idiot.
[380:18.78]What an imbecile.
[380:23.30]You are so awesome.
[380:24.76]Please don't turn.
[380:25.90]You just do so good opening doors.
[380:30.78]What are you... Last time somebody did this.
[380:38.29]Alright.
[380:41.43]Alright, let's go.
[380:45.29]Save point's in here.
[380:49.68]Along with a bunch of good fire ammo, pistol ammo, and... What is that?
[380:58.65]Shotgun ammo?
[381:01.13]What do you have?
[381:02.17]You have a shotgun.
[381:03.33]You and I can speak.
[381:08.47]You need heals, too.
[381:09.50]Done.
[381:18.95]Anything else down here to look at?
[381:21.43]There is.
[381:23.61]I'm not going to press that button.
[381:24.73]It opens up the fire door.
[381:29.37]One, two.
[381:33.89]Alright.
[382:03.56]No, no, no, no.
[382:38.96]Are you still on their team?
[382:46.95]What the fuck?
[383:06.38]Alright, let's go.
[383:07.26]Round two.
[383:09.32]This time I'm just whipping grenades.
[383:11.12]That's just what I'm going to do.
[383:12.66]I'm going to do just grenades only, and hopefully you guys can handle whatever else happens.
[383:18.26]Good.
[383:22.87]Like, for instance.
[383:27.97]Nice.
[383:36.71]Okay.
[383:37.63]Here we go.
[383:43.79]Watch it.
[383:44.19]Watch it.
[383:44.51]Watch it.
[383:45.17]Somebody take... I'll do it.
[383:50.30]Fire.
[383:51.90]And fire.
[383:53.52]Because technically it's fire and fire.
[383:56.44]Alright.
[383:56.78]Okay.
[384:17.22]How you doing?
[384:19.08]You could use a heal, but you'd be fine.
[384:20.42]You'd be alright.
[384:21.96]Wait, what happened?
[384:25.18]We good?
[384:30.84]Hold on.
[384:31.86]Is this frying out on us?
[384:39.21]What was the last thing you saw?
[384:53.00]When you threw a grenade.
[384:55.63]Oh, well.
[384:56.27]Take a look.
[384:57.57]That was... You missed something actually pretty funny.
[384:59.35]That's too bad.
[385:01.09]That is too bad.
[385:03.43]They were fighting over here.
[385:05.61]The soldiers were fighting the weird mutant thing in here.
[385:08.61]And it was great.
[385:09.63]It was really funny.
[385:15.28]It was a whole shitshow over here.
[385:20.24]Are we going down again?
[385:24.24]Quick, everyone laugh.
[385:27.01]Reload it.
[385:27.89]No, I'm not going to reload it.
[385:31.91]Just do it again.
[385:34.94]Oh, I see what you're saying.
[385:36.80]Yeah.
[385:37.26]Hey, thanks for the sympathy laughs.
[385:38.80]Appreciate it.
[385:40.96]Okay.
[385:42.82]There is a thing over here.
[385:45.67]I don't know what this...
[385:51.63]Is that us?
[385:52.77]Okay, I was supposed to shoot that guy, and it was my guy.
[385:55.29]Okay, well this exa- I can't see anything.
[386:04.27]Okay.
[386:05.17]We're gonna just keep going this way.
[386:09.55]Holy fuck!
[386:16.11]Come on!
[386:16.45]Get up!
[386:16.97]Get up!
[386:18.42]Get up!
[386:18.76]Oh, I could-
[386:29.55]We good?
[386:30.67]Hey!
[386:31.81]Get up!
[386:41.92]I just freaked the fuck out.
[386:47.38]But we all have full health.
[386:52.51]I'm supposed to be doing the grenade strategy right now.
[386:54.73]What am I thinking?
[387:13.45]Holy fuck, he just got lit up.
[387:23.15]Can you heal him?
[387:23.95]He's not doing so well.
[387:27.19]Get him.
[387:27.77]Heal.
[387:28.92]Look at his health.
[387:29.42]Come on, man.
[387:37.13]Engineer, right?
[387:41.05]We have an engineer.
[387:43.15]Be ready for whatever's behind this door.
[387:47.11]What if he wasn't here?
[387:48.83]If you weren't here, what happens?
[387:50.19]Do you just lose?
[387:55.91]I need... I can... I'm gonna use a flare for the... I don't have any.
[388:09.55]Oh!
[388:10.05]I wonder if that's an alien.
[388:12.82]No, it couldn't be.
[388:14.70]No way.
[388:16.58]Not the guy standing.
[388:26.95]Let's go find out.
[388:32.81]Hmm!
[388:42.25]What a surprise!
[388:49.65]You mean to tell me the guy with no emotions standing... Aye!
[388:54.72]What are you doing?
[388:55.56]No, I need you alive!
[388:58.26]I need you alive.
[388:58.84]I need you alive.
[388:59.32]I need you alive.
[388:59.82]Uh-oh.
[389:07.45]No.
[389:09.57]Uh-oh.
[389:09.83]How do we get that off of you?
[389:11.42]How do we get it off of you?
[389:12.90]How do we get that off of you?
[389:15.86]You... Okay, we need to find a door for you to open before you turn.
[389:23.31]Okay, I need a door for you to open.
[389:24.99]Something for you to press a button on because you're going to become a monster.
[389:29.43]Kill him now.
[389:30.09]No, not yet.
[389:30.67]He needs to open a door.
[389:35.97]What?
[389:37.71]Oh my god.
[389:38.83]Oh my god.
[389:40.43]Oh my god, I'm panicking.
[389:42.27]He's got us trapped.
[389:42.97]He's got us trapped.
[389:43.55]He's got us trapped.
[389:44.09]He's got us trapped.
[389:44.63]He's got us trapped.
[389:45.81]He's got us trapped.
[389:47.28]He's got us trapped.
[389:52.13]Don't walk over there.
[389:53.27]I missed him.
[389:55.19]No, what are you doing?
[390:03.13]He's still alive!
[390:06.21]Get him, get him, get him, get him, get him!
[390:08.61]Alright, we're fine.
[390:09.99]Sniper!
[390:11.21]Sniper!
[390:12.49]Oh shit!
[390:15.87]Watch out!
[390:20.87]Okay, everything's fine.
[390:25.08]Don't shoot.
[390:25.54]He's aiming at me.
[390:36.44]He's got plot armor.
[390:39.41]No, he doesn't.
[390:40.19]Plot armor.
[390:52.05]That's so fucking stupid.
[390:53.41]There's so many... I hear so many grunts.
[390:56.15]Wait!
[390:56.43]I think there's a machine gun over here.
[390:59.15]There's a safe point, though.
[391:00.45]Um... Oh, for... Where is this?
[391:19.58]That I hear.
[391:21.49]It's behind this door.
[391:24.07]Okay.
[391:25.49]Yes, we do.
[391:26.85]But they're not here yet.
[391:27.89]They're behind the door.
[391:31.63]Are you alright?
[391:36.51]You don't look alright.
[391:46.12]I know you just took a high explosive grenade in the face, but I need you down here.
[391:52.99]Down the stairs, please.
[391:56.99]There we go.
[391:57.43]He just needed a little nudge.
[391:59.29]And you're all doing fine.
[392:01.03]This is the door we have to open.
[392:02.17]It's been saved.
[392:04.40]I need to get some heavy power out here.
[392:06.36]I'm ready to throw a grenade right...
[392:19.74]Why is the door closed behind me?
[392:22.19]Where are my friends?
[392:41.01]They locked me in.
[392:44.79]Uh...
[392:54.51]What?
[392:55.35]What do you mean time's up?
[392:58.93]You're not even in here with me.
[393:00.87]You're not even in the room.
[393:03.16]And apparently... I don't have any healing.
[393:14.78]Oh, fuck.
[393:15.35]I got his attention.
[393:16.39]That's the thing that I need to deal with.
[393:24.03]How do I... How do I aim?
[393:25.19]Oh, I forgot how to aim.
[393:26.39]Is this working?
[394:26.75]Finish it with fire.
[394:28.89]I can't even get over here.
[394:52.01]We're right here.
[394:53.49]Do the winch.
[394:54.13]What winch?
[394:55.63]Why is there a winch, though?
[395:00.27]By the way, give me all your stuff.
[395:02.33]If you're not going to help me.
[395:04.35]If you're not going to help me, then give me all the shit that you have.
[395:10.81]What do you have?
[395:14.86]Get me a weapon.
[395:16.48]Actually, you know what?
[395:18.74]I take that back.
[395:21.58]Yes.
[395:22.69]Here, you can have that actually.

[404:55.41]I didn't need to... Hold on.
[404:56.58]Kill me.
[404:58.64]I did that.
[404:59.05]I wasted so much ammo.
[405:12.24]I shot him like seven times with the most expensive rifle in the game.
[405:16.44]Here's what we're going to do.
[405:17.55]Just burn him.
[405:18.81]You just... Alright, come over here.

[405:24.09]So... Don't shoot him until he's ready.

[405:49.04]I'm saving the game.
[405:49.64]Okay.
[405:58.75]Your job is to just stand in the back and heal me.
[406:02.05]That's all you're going to be doing.

[408:54.43]Why would there be a lip?
[408:55.31]Why would there be a lip?
[408:56.83]Why is there a lip?
[408:58.03]What's the lip for?
[408:59.53]Lips, it's for nothing.
[409:01.63]There's a lip for no reason.
[409:36.82]I'm dead.
[409:46.73]Hitting the button behind him?
[409:48.03]I can't go over there!
[409:53.02]Wait a minute.
[409:53.44]Hold on.
[409:53.88]Wait a second.
[409:54.46]Wait a second.

[410:26.47]Maybe you can go behind it when he falls down.
[410:27.95]I don't... There's no way to get in there.
[410:30.83]It's all blocked off.
[410:32.77]And he didn't get in again.
[410:35.01]Alright, this is a fuck... This is just a fuckface run.
[410:45.14]No, I can't get back there.
[410:47.02]What about the truck?
[410:49.44]Nope.
[410:50.48]Nope.
[410:51.16]And... No.
[410:51.86]No.
[410:55.72]Let's see what happens if I do this.
[411:00.93]No, you get electrocuted.
[411:01.89]You just get electrocuted.
[411:21.00]Stand in the corner.
[411:23.04]What does the wench do?
[411:24.48]When you activate that, I can drop the electricity on him.
[411:26.92]That stuns him.
[411:28.34]But it also electrifies the ground.
[411:30.68]And you're fighting... You're fighting in, like, the inside of a blender.
[411:34.60]That's the amount of space that there is.
[411:37.24]So... Throw all grenades, then stun and shoot his neck.
[411:43.55]Like, with a regular gun?
[411:49.07]Shoot belly during stun.
[411:51.72]Shooting neck.
[411:55.71]Get in.
[411:57.21]Come on, turn this way.
[411:58.55]You beautiful, beautiful, beautiful bastards.
[412:01.29]Get over here.
[412:02.29]Alright, stay right there.
[412:03.27]I think this is the one.
[412:11.13]I mean, it's hurting.
[412:24.90]I don't think... I don't think bullets do anything.
[412:28.90]Alright, here we go.
[412:29.52]I'm gonna stun, run back.
[412:32.52]Heal me.
[412:32.90]Thank you.
[412:33.26]Okay.
[412:58.13]Hey, hi.
[412:59.99]Thanks.
[413:05.00]You... I don't want you... I want you over here.
[413:09.62]Follow me.
[413:10.86]I want you right here.
[413:12.00]In the back, where nobody can hurt you.
[413:20.13]Stay there.
[413:35.03]This is... This is the dumbest boss fight.
[413:40.72]Throw more grenades!
[413:41.58]Throw them in the corner!
[413:42.76]Throw the grenades in the corner!
[414:35.08]Why would you fight a guy that's 25 feet tall in a space THIS BIG?! !
[414:54.86]Because you have to.
[414:57.95]Why do I have to fight him here?
[415:00.75]Why?
[415:01.73]You got... Get in there.
[415:03.69]I had it this time.
[415:06.09]You need to... Spam that.
[415:09.67]Keep spamming it.
[415:10.75]Spam the fuck out of that.
[415:12.05]I want to see what that says.
[415:14.03]That's the only thing I want to have in the chat.
[415:15.81]Hit the middle part of his body to kill him.
[415:20.65]I recommend... Too fast.
[415:22.19]I recommend you... Too fast.
[415:25.19]I recommend you throw grenade.
[415:27.30]You need to... It's going too fast.
[415:28.66]I can't do it.
[415:36.10]Go.
[415:36.64]Okay.
[415:36.98]You need to hit the middle part of his body.
[415:38.56]I recommend throwing a grenade to... His right.
[415:47.65]Alright.
[415:48.15]Alright.
[415:48.39]Sub only.
[415:49.31]Sub only.
[415:49.83]Sub only.
[415:50.21]Sub only.
[415:50.53]Sub only.
[415:50.81]Sub only.
[415:51.19]Sub only.
[415:51.53]Sub only.
[415:53.67]Sub only, sub only and then I can read it from there.
[416:00.56]After you're out of grenades,
[416:23.48]You need to hit the middle part of his body to kill him.
[416:27.63]I recommend throwing grenades over the right-most box and after you're out of grenades, attempt to use the stun to finish him off with your ammo.
[416:34.69]I beat this game a couple years ago.
[416:36.01]Okay.
[416:44.24]This box.
[416:44.82]But I tried that last time and I fucking ruined everything.
[416:51.22]Over the... Over here?
[416:57.88]It doesn't work, man!
[417:01.81]Over the rightmost... I can't... I can't throw him any higher!
[417:18.24]Going to first person?
[417:20.14]That wasn't part of the instructions.
[417:22.58]That wasn't part of the instructions.
[417:32.32]Oh my god, this is fucking ridiculous.
[417:34.84]Alright, get over here.
[417:36.53]If I can get you in the room, it'd be great.
[417:44.31]I'm so sick of seeing this guy.
[417:47.23]He didn't even come close.
[417:48.45]Okay.
[417:51.42]First person.
[418:00.44]Fucking God!
[418:02.00]Just do it!
[418:02.82]Kill- This is so fucked up.
[418:17.29]This is so fucked up.
[418:18.87]This boss is stupid.
[418:20.43]It is dumb.
[418:21.19]It's fucked up.
[418:22.25]This is fucked up.
[418:23.21]Alright?
[418:23.61]It's just- It's messed up.
[418:24.88]It's stupid.
[418:27.08]It's just dumb.
[418:29.54]Alright, we all agree.
[418:31.18]Good.
[418:31.52]Okay, cool.
[418:32.40]Let's continue our quest.
[418:33.82]This is just stupid.
[418:35.48]Okay, here we go.
[418:40.60]Don't fucking move.
[418:41.45]Just throw them all.
[418:58.42]Okay.
[419:17.74]I'm not missing, right?
[419:20.56]How could you miss?
[419:21.38]He's fucking the whole... He's the whole corner.
[419:28.18]This dude's the entire corner.
[419:32.56]And now you're saying don't use the flamethrower.
[419:37.66]Just shoot him.
[419:42.69]Like in the stomach.
[419:44.99]Stun and shoot him.
[420:12.42]How many bullets does it take to kill this motherfucker?
[420:23.08]Let's be very clear about something here.
[420:25.00]That was seven high explosive grenades.
[420:28.71]Four regular grenades and like five clips into his chest.
[420:43.29]Final shot needs to be fire.
[420:46.30]That wasn't part of the instructions?
[420:51.12]I didn't miss all the grenades?
[421:02.09]Turn on auto-aim, lower difficulty so you can see his HP.
[421:10.38]Just look it up on you.
[421:11.28]I don't even know what this guy's called.
[421:12.58]The final boss of the thing?
[421:16.98]He's almost in here.
[421:18.72]Oh, thank God.
[421:19.42]Get in.
[421:20.60]This time I'm not gonna fuck this up.
[421:21.82]Stay there.
[421:22.58]Don't move.
[421:23.40]Stay there.
[421:25.34]Here we go.
[421:26.12]Okay.
[421:26.56]Don't move.
[421:28.34]You're not... I cannot fuck this up.
[421:36.85]Get a little closer.
[421:47.57]Holy shit, I can't believe it.
[421:49.73]I'm gonna die.
[421:51.99]Heal me.
[421:54.42]It went through the... Stay here.
[421:56.62]Alright, it's working.
[422:05.24]I feel like I'm not... I need to be a little further back.
[422:18.90]Where'd it go?
[422:44.81]Is that even hitting him?
[422:46.51]I gotta bounce it off of this wall.
[422:55.93]I don't know.
[422:56.89]But I'm just gonna say it is.
[422:59.99]I can't move.
[423:10.19]Okay.
[423:15.57]The HE hit, but the one's small.
[423:18.76]What?
[423:19.86]In the neck.
[423:21.12]In the... Whose neck?
[423:23.28]Aim for the neck thing.
[423:30.11]This thing has like five necks.
[423:33.17]The whole thing is a neck.
[423:48.10]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[423:49.28]Time to go back.
[423:52.58]Hey.
[423:54.76]Alright, you pansy.
[424:01.71]I'm aiming too low.
[424:05.97]What the fuck?
[424:09.83]This game sucks.
[424:13.35]I didn't say it, Kim did.
[424:23.51]The neck?
[424:23.97]I have to go, I have to go, I have to go.
[424:32.51]he's a snake tongue that has two people between the two arms like okay so if this is the snake tongue you want me to shoot in here into the middle of the snake's tongue right under the
[425:06.43]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[425:21.28]Can you imagine actually playing this game when it came out and being like, this is normal.
[425:26.13]This is what you do.
[425:27.27]This is just normal.
[425:46.05]Too scared.
[425:51.68]Flamethrower.
[426:04.30]Heal me, please.
[426:11.03]Stay back here.
[426:12.01]Don't go through the wall.
[426:13.53]I might have to take his shotgun.
[426:38.39]Just keep doing whatever you're doing.
[426:53.38]There's no hitbox!
[426:54.50]It's not even hitting him anymore!
[427:05.57]Don't go over there.
[427:06.86]Go over here.
[427:08.50]Watch the YouTube link.
[427:10.48]Imagine having to watch a YouTube link to fucking fight a boss.
[427:14.14]Me too.
[427:34.82]Shoot higher.
[427:40.46]What's this thing called?
[427:44.38]What's the name of this boss?
[427:45.18]I don't care.
[427:45.76]Spoil the whole game.
[427:46.40]Fuck it.
[427:46.68]I don't give a shit.
[427:49.14]The hitbox is at the very top where it branches.
[427:55.21]Are you guys fucking with me?
[427:58.15]The thing.
[427:59.71]Boss 2.
[428:03.37]This is just fucking bonkers to me.
[428:09.03]Not The Thing Bird 2.
[428:11.51]No, not Angry Birds the Movie 2.
[428:13.39]The Thing Boss 2.
[428:15.87]Let's take a look.
[428:18.19]The Thing Boss Fight 2.
[428:22.63]How to beat the boss 2?
[428:26.63]Hold onto three flame grenades.
[428:29.41]I don't have those.
[428:31.33]Uh, the thing.
[428:31.97]Second boss is impossible.
[428:33.93]I used to really like this game, but the boss battles are simp- Hold on.
[428:43.82]I used to really like this game, but the boss battles are simply frustrating to behold.
[428:48.56]The second is particularly annoying, as you have to go into the first-person mode to hit the boss properly, but unfortunately you're in a cramped space and get stuck on junk and get killed.
[428:56.53]Also, when trying to run back behind the crates in front of the door, there appears to be a step that Blake can't walk over.
[429:06.41]So, um, help me, please, beat this stupid game so I can be done with it and sell it.
[429:19.43]Sell it when was this posted 2001?
[429:22.59]Okay If it's the one I'm thinking of with the big ceiling tall thing And there are some tentacles that come out of the wall to your right he was pretty easy wrong boss I
[429:41.04]Screw that!
[429:41.34]Okay, let's continue.
[429:57.19]Hmm.
[429:57.99]I don't think I've gotten to that one yet.
[429:59.95]I'm near the tail end of getting out of that facility, but I ran my guy into an area to explore, and the floor suddenly caught on fire, killing me and royally pissing me off because there were no save points near that area, and I had already been trying to get through it hundreds of times.
[430:14.10]So I haven't played it since.
[430:18.32]Okay.
[430:21.10]Oh yeah, you're much farther back than me.
[430:22.36]Oh yes, I remember that boss, I believe!
[430:24.51]It's the one with the... What?
[430:29.35]One trick for that one is that just inside the door you can make shots between the crates with the incendiary grenade launcher in the back of the boss and kill him.
[430:35.11]Remember to let each grenade burn out before firing the next one.
[430:38.59]My brother killed him with four grenades.
[430:42.04]Somebody just gave 20 community subs.
[430:46.62]This doesn't help me at all.
[430:59.42]He's dead?
[431:11.17]Did you-?
[431:17.49]It's-
[431:32.65]What?
[431:33.21]Hey, we just eat shit?
[431:36.07]Watch out.
[431:40.45]Save the game.
[431:47.93]Okay, you can follow me now.
[431:55.47]What was the point of this?
[432:00.27]I don't know, but thankfully I read that guide.
[432:02.87]Look at my hair.
[432:04.99]All we had to do was read?
[432:06.20]I know.
[432:10.68]He had like two HP left.
[432:12.68]You could just burn him and run.
[432:14.52]I thought you had to cut his arm off.
[432:16.34]I don't know.
[432:16.76]Alright, let's go.
[432:20.14]Game is saved.
[432:21.52]Please don't turn on me now.
[432:22.58]I need you.
[432:24.58]That's it.
[432:24.92]That's in here.
[432:29.98]Here we go.
[432:32.88]That was the end of the game.
[432:33.72]That's the final end of the game.
[432:47.07]So what now?
[432:55.47]Was that- that was the thing.
[433:00.41]There's a bomb.
[433:02.75]We should probably run.
[433:09.09]It's 30 seconds to get out of here.
[433:12.38]I only get 30 seconds.
[433:17.98]That does not seem like a lot of time.
[433:48.71]He didn't make it.
[433:50.75]He didn't make it.
[433:51.35]He was so close.
[433:53.33]You were so close.
[434:10.66]Was that NPC?
[434:27.08]What the fuck was that guy doing?
[434:33.28]Are these my friends?
[434:34.88]Are these people like... Do I know these people?
[434:37.86]I don't know if I'm supposed to be doing this.
[434:54.12]No, no way.
[435:08.31]I need a save point or something.
[435:16.04]Nobody has fired at me.
[435:18.14]Am I doing something wrong?
[435:38.07]How do I get this door open?
[435:42.67]There's a safe point in here.
[435:43.85]Open this fucking door right now.
[435:58.99]I actually can't die here because I'll have to do the whole thing over again.
[436:15.56]Get my flashlight.
[436:40.07]Just keep the door open.
[436:40.99]Put a door stop on.
[436:41.79]I don't know.
[436:42.13]Do something.
[436:49.15]For excavation purposes, we have a stock of C4 charges in the armory below.
[436:54.55]Please obtain a pass from your superior prior to checking out any explosives.
[436:58.52]Any person found carrying explosives without the correct paperwork will be detained.
[437:03.12]C4 below.
[437:08.77]Those things don't open, right?
[437:11.31]They better not.
[437:14.06]Holding area access.
[437:16.14]I gotta turn the power on here.
[437:19.61]Come on, power.
[437:20.21]This could be like a power box or something here.
[437:22.09]Those things, I hope they don't get out.
[437:36.87]I thought we were gonna get to see an epilogue.
[437:40.08]Is this the epilogue?
[437:40.88]It might be.
[437:42.34]Alright, we'll see if this is the epilogue.
[437:44.62]I wish I had a couple of people with me.
[437:55.68]Die!
[437:59.97]Nothing, alright.
[438:01.15]Watch out for that baby fire.
[438:19.92]What was that?
[438:54.65]Jesus Christ they weren't here yeah I walked in this room and there was nobody here they spawned they spawned in front of me that's exactly what happened I refuse to believe anything else
[439:26.87]only one you're gonna put one health pack in here one there's usually like seven there's seven arrayed in here every single time that's not gonna work why did I do that it was contained it was contained
[440:05.23]What was I doing?
[440:06.59]Burn him!
[440:37.44]No, I just... How do I get into the save point?
[440:46.90]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[440:54.08]No.
[440:54.92]No.
[440:56.59]Why was I... The sniper rifle is the worst item in the game.
[441:03.69]It's the worst item in every game.
[441:06.80]There's no reason to ever put it on.
[441:10.93]Why ever equip the sniper rifle?
[441:13.41]Ever!
[441:15.77]It's so... It's so bad.
[441:24.76]You're the worst item in the game.
[441:26.24]Alright, what am I doing?
[441:31.76]I need to get in here.
[441:33.30]How do I get in this fucking door?
[441:39.80]How do I open up this save point?
[441:44.84]Let me in there.
[441:45.68]Oh my god, thank goodness I went back.
[441:55.37]Alright, how do I get in here, guys?
[441:56.25]What do you think?
[441:57.85]I can't press this button.
[441:58.91]I can't do anything.
[442:06.53]This doesn't do anything.
[442:07.83]I already tried it.
[442:16.21]You walk past the switch box.
[442:17.73]What?
[442:23.97]Where is there a switch box?
[442:25.03]I don't see a switch box.
[442:31.31]No, there's no- I can't open this door.
[442:35.71]There is not a switch box anywhere to be found.
[442:37.73]I mean, there's a computer over here.
[442:43.45]That doesn't do anything.
[442:47.58]You tried to push it.
[442:48.46]No, I'm going to activate a power source.
[442:51.32]I got that health pack, so that's good.
[442:53.28]Alright, let's keep going.
[442:59.05]Why does this keep getting turned off?
[443:01.99]You're fucking messing everything up.
[443:06.43]Okay.
[443:09.33]Holding area.
[443:10.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[443:11.29]Yeah, it does.
[443:12.19]Wait.
[443:12.35]I'm
[443:15.94]No, that box can't be turned on either.
[443:18.52]Guys, we're so close to the end.
[443:19.83]Do you really want to bait me into walking through a door I already looked at five times?
[443:27.43]I need an engineer.
[443:49.35]I lost my... I can't believe I lost my medic friend.
[443:51.74]Holy fuck, I forgot this as we were going forward.
[444:02.11]You fucking dumbasses.
[444:22.50]I think I have to go in here.
[444:27.28]It's another bait.
[445:34.65]What?
[445:34.93]Who?
[445:36.29]Who didn't give me a weapon?
[445:38.42]Is it a friend?
[445:39.70]No, I need a friend!
[445:43.06]Is that guy spy crabbing?
[445:49.67]You from that bogus research team Whitley sent in?
[445:52.63]Uh, yeah.
[445:53.45]Oh my god.
[445:54.07]Your ass says thanks for being saved.
[445:56.55]Sorry.
[445:57.51]Thanks for the rescue.
[445:59.39]Those troopers are everywhere.
[446:00.71]You the reason they're here?
[446:02.79]Maybe.
[446:03.85]But they're taking that cargo awfully seriously.
[446:06.63]Who's the cargo for?
[446:08.31]I don't know, but it sure ain't the Red Cross.
[446:10.93]If Whitley's behind this, that cargo's gotta be destroyed.
[446:17.46]This is melted.
[446:19.08]Are you an engineer?
[446:22.60]Tell me you are.
[446:23.60]Are you... Are you an engineer?
[446:27.76]Let me give you something.
[446:28.46]Here.
[446:29.35]Here.
[446:30.85]Take a machine gun.
[446:37.46]Good.
[446:37.82]Okay.
[446:44.24]Save terminal.
[446:49.44]A save terminal.
[446:51.02]Imagine if he had died in here and I didn't get in here fast enough.
[446:54.64]That would have been a fucking nightmare.
[446:58.97]Fix it all.
[447:01.23]Holy shit.
[447:02.49]Thank God.
[447:03.19]Alright, what are you fixing?
[447:05.67]Fix that.
[447:06.45]Fix everything.
[447:17.70]Alright, let's go.
[447:29.37]Don't shoot me in the back.
[447:32.09]Alright.
[447:34.39]Who was it?
[447:35.77]It's Phylactery Lich.
[447:37.53]10,000 bits.
[447:40.27]$100 from Phylactery.
[447:42.37]Coming in with another gigantic money drop.
[447:45.89]Huge fucking bits.
[447:52.09]Phylactery Lich.
[447:53.47]Yeah, am I not saying it right?
[447:57.17]I wish there was health in here.
[448:01.96]Someone gave 50 gift subs earlier.
[448:03.74]That's right!
[448:04.50]Who gave all those gift subs?
[448:05.66]Somebody gave a shitload.
[448:06.84]What was it?
[448:15.03]Who gave 50 gifted subs?
[448:17.15]Two people?
[448:19.37]Well, whoever you were, thank you.
[448:21.05]I was probably locked into something on here.
[448:24.33]And I didn't even notice.
[448:25.15]It was at... Martin?
[448:30.70]Martin had a meme?
[448:33.50]thank you for the subs thank you so much what did the message say for uh phylactery yo he's looking up the guide okay here take some of this okay stay with me uh actually no give me some of that back actually give me the whole thing back
[449:03.08]You can have four.
[449:07.34]What does it say?
[449:08.44]Hey, Jeremy, it's been a pretty good stream.
[449:09.50]Just want to let you know, literally every gun you've used uses magazines, not clips.
[449:18.41]Right, but it's... Magazines is three syllables.
[449:21.49]Clips is one.
[449:22.21]It's easier to say.
[449:25.01]I can get it out faster.
[449:27.33]But thank you for the hundred bucks.
[449:28.67]That's a lot of money.
[449:33.14]Just say, no, it's a clip.
[449:35.28]Alright, you have everything you need.
[449:39.50]We still have no healing.
[449:42.46]That's not good.
[449:43.72]I don't like that.
[449:47.06]Let's head back, save the game again.
[449:48.84]This way, we're good.
[449:53.66]There's another thing for you to open back in the beginning.
[449:58.98]I'm so glad I've...
[450:01.96]What the hell are you thinking?
[450:10.92]Wait.
[450:18.08]I'm trying to turn on the... he's trying to... I know what he's trying to do.
[450:22.17]He didn't get it though.
[450:24.11]Can I turn this on?
[450:25.63]Power this place?
[450:26.33]Is there a box?
[450:30.53]Is there no box in here?
[450:32.07]How could there not be a box?
[450:34.73]I have an engineer now.
[450:42.64]Yeah.
[450:45.00]Trying to scare me.
[450:48.90]Another- somebody- Ball of Koala gave $55.
[450:52.29]You missed Potato Chief's gift subs too.

[450:58.15]Thank you for the 50... $50!
[451:04.42]That's a... This has been a money stream tonight, apparently.
[451:08.46]Holy shit, guys.
[451:10.47]Uh, thank you.
[451:11.19]And then they said Eudengus, but I didn't read that part.
[451:13.11]Because I want people to think I'm strong.
[451:16.01]Alright, this health pack's over here.
[451:24.38]Don't turn.
[451:25.48]I really hope you don't turn.
[451:26.83]What do I have for health right now?
[451:31.49]I don't know.
[451:33.43]I'm not going to take it because I don't know.
[451:35.45]It's obviously not low enough to be that much of a big deal.
[451:45.54]Engineer.
[451:47.14]I need an engineer.
[451:48.04]Okay.

[487:12.52]What are you doing?
[487:13.88]Hurry up!

[487:30.84]But what are you hiding behind the door?
[487:32.54]Okay, let's keep going.
[487:44.15]Anything else in here that I can grab?
[487:47.83]Just checking to see if I can break it.
[487:49.85]I need to turn off this alarm before it drives me nuts.

[488:10.44]And some fire?
[488:12.00]Good.

[488:16.92]I don't think I'm gonna ban all subs.
[488:20.74]That would be too many of you.
[488:22.25]You would all be banned.
[488:24.11]At least 40% of you.
[488:32.22]Alright.
[488:34.34]Mmm, this way.

[492:43.10]I don't have any heals, do I?
[492:46.63]What was that?
[492:50.09]He was underneath me.
[492:55.71]Oh, that sucks.
[492:56.61]Okay.
[492:57.78]423.
[492:57.80]It's this one here.
[492:58.94]He was literally standing underneath me.
[493:01.90]Alright.
[493:02.42]You are infected right now, but I need you.
[493:04.44]I need you.
[493:06.72]So, I'm going to deal with it because I need you to just exist.
[493:12.64]Okay, let's go.
[493:15.66]Buy health.
[493:16.68]I can't purchase.
[493:17.32]There's no health purchasing.
[493:19.07]Okay, go through here.
[493:30.95]Then up here.
[493:31.87]Wait, am I going?
[493:32.69]I'm going backwards.
[493:33.53]Shit.
[493:36.09]Give ads.
[493:36.81]Give ads.
[493:38.31]I physically can't even run them.
[493:41.80]I can't run adds.
[493:43.70]I can't be run.
[493:52.93]I have one health pack, right?
[493:54.15]No, at this point I don't have any.
[494:00.57]I just can't die up here.
[494:01.63]There's so many ridiculous enemies up here.
[494:08.69]I wonder, how the hell am I gonna do this?
[494:12.71]I think I'm just gonna run.
[494:14.40]I think it's time to run.
[494:16.30]We're at the stage of the game where... I can't hit this like... Okay.
[494:39.56]I'm going to run by everything.
[494:42.09]It's not worth fighting.
[494:43.86]It's time just to go.
[494:45.60]It's time to go.
[494:55.97]Go!
[494:57.69]Go, go, go, go, go!
[494:59.15]What the fuck?!

[495:05.65]Fight them in the elevator!
[495:08.38]Fight them in the elevator!
[495:13.94]Bye.
[495:16.08]Oh my god!
[495:17.90]See ya.
[495:18.60]Run.
[495:20.70]Can I go in here?
[495:21.60]Nope.
[495:33.59]I got lit up by five different angles.
[495:39.40]How are you supposed to do this?
[495:41.98]How are you supposed to reliably get through that?
[495:48.61]I don't know.
[495:49.53]Just like... Sorry, I can only afford 50 bucks this time.
[495:55.32]Please don't hit me like anymore.
[495:57.54]Thank you, Multitrip, for the $55, 5,500 bits.
[496:03.48]Holy... Thank you.
[496:05.62]What am I going to do about this?
[496:06.94]I don't think running works.
[496:08.82]It kind of does, but then you have to fight everything.
[496:14.96]I'm going to try it again.
[496:15.76]This time I'm going to go... I don't know what to do.
[496:32.91]Slow down?
[496:38.01]I mean, I just wish I had some health.
[496:42.61]Because here comes that big fight with the... Just let them kill each other.
[496:48.45]Just let them fight, but I'm going to try to activate the elevator.
[496:51.11]It has this constant chaos.
[496:52.61]Did I seriously get hit by one of these little fucking, like, drain clogs?
[496:58.27]Did I really let that happen?
[497:11.38]yes I I already have like five times alright I'm okay how can there be nothing in there alright
[497:36.81]Come here, come here, come here.
[497:38.89]Just let them kill each other.

[497:58.52]Oh, there's two now.
[498:09.55]They're gonna break, they're gonna break the door down.
[498:23.17]Nice job, nice job, nice job, nice job.
[498:28.19]Don't get so close!
[498:29.93]Why are you getting that close?
[498:31.55]He's gonna charge.
[498:39.85]Okay, there's another one in there.
[498:41.19]There's two more.
[498:41.95]Is there a safe around here?
[498:49.79]Where?
[498:50.09]Whoa, everyone's doing Jupiters.
[498:52.43]Where's the other one?

[499:45.52]This health kit's in this room?
[499:49.44]Where?
[500:00.06]Oh, I know, but you can't... Mmm...
[500:09.55]So close, yet so far.
[500:13.55]Damn it.
[500:15.92]One of them breaks out.

[501:05.48]Over here, do that.
[501:06.96]Turn it on.
[501:09.01]Turn that on.
[501:16.26]That's power for the whole room.
[501:23.61]What's taking so long?
[501:29.79]What?
[501:30.79]What is it?
[501:31.27]What's going on?
[501:33.98]What's wrong with you?
[501:34.58]What are you doing?
[501:39.26]Alright, alright, just hold on.
[501:40.52]Let me just attack the computer.
[501:44.74]I've locked the grenade launcher and a consignment of ammo in my office.
[501:48.10]2622.
[501:48.30]There are a lot of trigger-happy men around here.
[501:50.87]Alright, let's go.
[501:54.57]Let's go.
[501:54.85]Out.
[501:55.21]Out of this room.

[502:12.76]Good.
[502:13.18]Okay, I need you over here.
[502:17.20]Where's the safe point?
[502:20.54]You gotta shine here, man.
[502:26.95]You gotta shine here.
[502:27.81]I need you to shine.
[502:28.57]I need you to shine right now.
[502:40.28]Be the best person.
[502:46.74]This is such a... This is a terrible speech.
[502:53.56]Alright, you know the drill.
[502:55.84]We have to win.
[502:56.48]Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back.
[503:19.45]Here he comes, here he comes.
[503:20.09]Okay, alright.
[503:20.95]Make it happen.
[503:21.57]You gotta shine here.
[503:23.45]Shine.
[503:31.59]Use the boxes.
[503:34.13]Use the boxes.
[503:40.90]He's dead.
[503:44.88]You shoot them, shoot them, shoot them.
[503:47.36]I feel like I'm playing a multiplayer game right now.
[503:51.59]Right now I'm playing like actually Left 4 Dead.
[503:56.39]Okay, now it's these guys.
[503:59.99]There's no more of those charging weirdos.
[504:03.00]It's just soldiers now, right?
[504:04.72]I think so.
[504:06.20]Any health packs?
[504:07.90]I hear the beep.
[504:09.18]In fact stay.
[504:36.08]Where is it?
[504:40.16]Oh my god.
[504:45.71]We did it.
[504:46.77]Grenade launcher.
[504:49.51]And a shitload of grenades.
[504:54.06]This is it.
[504:55.54]This is it.
[504:59.01]I got a million grenades.
[505:02.27]Don't just go out there.
[505:02.99]I know you're going to turn in a second and you did a great job.
[505:08.11]This one.
[505:09.67]You did a fantastic job.
[505:12.33]Somebody just gave another $55.
[505:16.24]Another huge amount of bits.
[505:19.84]Who was it?
[505:24.01]It was HM Zine.
[505:26.11]Or HM Zine.
[505:28.65]5500 bits.
[505:30.19]So I heard you're the guy to talk to about moving desks.
[505:32.25]Hope this covers the fee.
[505:33.28]I think I left some Cheetos in one of the draws if you get hungry.
[505:37.70]Thank you.
[505:40.68]Thank you so much.
[505:44.52]We're at the endgame here.
[505:47.57]And I have a grenade launcher.
[505:53.04]Where are these bastards?
[505:57.66]Do I need to even use it?
[506:02.77]Is he turned?
[506:03.15]Uh-oh, he's being a weirdo.
[506:06.37]Come on.
[506:10.45]I need you to, like, come out here.
[506:15.25]Come on.
[506:16.20]Get out there and find somebody.
[506:31.26]Is he dead?
[506:31.56]Alright.
[506:33.58]Almost there.
[506:34.08]Oh, and I gotta, like, use the bathroom, too.
[506:39.97]Uh-oh.
[506:45.35]Hope this is the final sequence, cause... Is there a key on the ground?
[506:57.12]No.
[506:57.64]Rifle.
[507:01.29]No, I'm okay.
[507:02.53]I'm fine.
[507:07.01]Plant C4 on cargo planes.
[507:11.07]You're still with me.
[507:14.14]Be with me to the end.
[507:20.50]What is going on?
[507:29.95]Uh...
[507:39.48]Why?
[507:39.74]What's going on?
[507:45.58]Can I not?
[507:46.12]Am I not supposed to go this way?
[507:49.50]Am I just supposed to run out?
[507:52.85]Just go this way?
[507:59.31]I'm dying.
[508:01.65]Running in circles.
[508:04.09]Where are these cargo planes?
[508:07.67]They just gave the shit out of me.
[508:11.88]Oh, fuck.
[508:12.42]Okay.
[508:13.16]Somebody just gave more money.
[508:19.50]I need to get in here.
[508:20.30]I need the warmth.
[508:20.91]Alright, we're good.
[508:26.73]I might... I... I...
[508:30.99]What was- who- who gives who- Suchipi!
[508:34.61]Suchipi gave 11,000 bits, another drop of ridiculous fucking money.
[508:41.28]Better hope this is the last sequence because peepee poo poo.
[508:45.96]Thank you for the extraordinary amount of money.
[509:00.81]You good?
[509:01.62]Okay.
[509:01.94]I have to do this to four planes?
[509:08.26]Four... planes?
[509:11.64]Is it healing?
[509:12.20]OI!
[509:14.37]Hey, CDC Frank, thanks for the five community subs.
[509:24.33]Just, it was a bait.
[509:25.07]Alright, let's put the C4 on this plane.
[509:26.43]I don't see any health.
[509:28.86]Where does it go?
[509:29.46]Underneath?
[509:31.20]In the front?
[509:33.80]Right here.
[509:36.26]I have to do this three more times.
[509:37.60]This is gonna be horrible.
[509:38.86]Alright, give me my rifle.
[509:46.33]They're in hangars.
[510:00.91]Take him out.
[510:02.35]Take him out.
[510:03.42]Take him out!
[510:06.74]Multitrip 5 community subs, thank you so much.
[510:16.69]What?
[510:29.07]Oh, no.
[510:30.15]Not yet.
[510:31.01]Get in here and do this first.
[510:34.78]Aim for center mass, but you gotta get a headshot.
[510:37.92]So it looks cool.
[510:53.27]Two to four.
[510:55.43]I need... Please give me something in here.
[510:57.53]I need health.
[511:01.88]Is that just this shit over here?
[511:03.96]Don't you freaking me out.
[511:07.22]Health pack, thank god.
[511:13.42]What's going on over there?
[511:19.24]I need a hat?
[511:21.12]I need sound effects before I actually get scared at this.
[511:26.34]Why am I glitching out, too?
[511:27.50]There's a lot of grenades over here.
[511:32.93]Um, this is a bait.
[511:34.67]This is fake.
[511:36.11]This is fake.
[511:37.77]This is a trap.
[511:39.97]Right?
[511:51.00]I mean, it wasn't that big of a trap, but it still was.
[511:54.12]I have full grenades.
[511:55.22]That's another health pack.
[511:57.88]Thank God.
[511:58.32]Alright, let's go.
[512:01.70]Could really use a save point.
[512:05.94]Oh, come on.
[512:06.68]Health packs?
[512:09.12]What is it?
[512:12.15]You've done such a great job.
[512:13.23]I'm going to be so sad when you are the one to turn at the end of the game.
[512:15.85]Alright, there's a... I can go over here.
[512:20.85]Any more of those hangars or to go forward?
[512:28.74]I hope I can just close the door on him.
[512:31.18]That sounds terrible, I know, but come on, give me... Give me some credit here.
[512:36.32]I gotta... I have to be... I gotta go.
[512:40.89]Don't turn in this tiny corridor, though.
[512:47.55]I hear beeping.
[512:49.82]Engineer.
[512:51.24]Open it.
[512:57.12]My god grenade launcher grenade launcher grenade launcher grenade launcher out the door Watch it watch it get out of the way move move.
[513:05.85]Don't blow us both up.
[513:06.73]You're gonna kill us both Oh fuck
[513:35.75]What's he doing?
[513:36.21]What are you doing?
[513:44.05]Okay, there's definitely more of those in there.
[513:48.25]Follow me.
[513:51.37]He's infected.
[513:52.68]He definitely is.
[513:53.86]But I need him around for at least another few minutes.
[514:01.20]Thank God.
[514:06.78]Oh!
[514:17.93]I saved it, right?
[514:18.99]I saved the game.
[514:27.17]Oh, thank God.
[514:29.57]So, if you pick up... Don't... It's if you stand up... Stay, stay.
[514:39.86]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up!
[514:43.50]Back up!
[514:45.02]Frank, it was nice knowing you.
[514:46.52]But if you don't back up right now, we're both dead.
[514:56.91]I tried to tell him.
[514:58.55]I tried to warn him.
[515:00.17]I tried.
[515:00.87]I tried to tell him.
[515:16.08]He's dead.
[515:21.70]Dead.
[515:29.83]He was a, he was a good, he was, he was a good person.
[515:40.56]Well that's terrifying.
[516:00.68]But I got the key.
[516:01.66]I got what I needed.
[516:03.70]I don't remember his name.
[516:11.70]I don't remember his name.
[516:17.61]But he was nice.
[516:18.39]He was a very good person.
[516:20.95]And he got me this far.
[516:24.45]He got me this far.
[516:32.67]Any keys or anything in the bathrooms?
[516:35.45]No.
[516:39.00]Nothing else I can explore?
[516:40.20]Oh, it's... It's Anthony's gun.
[516:49.49]Oh no.
[516:50.63]I can do it.
[516:50.99]We're close.
[517:05.48]What?
[517:07.24]Oh, I don't have an engineer.
[517:08.02]I don't know why that would hurt.
[517:14.76]I do hear beeps.

[519:00.51]Check him.
[519:02.01]I don't care.
[519:03.81]He needs to just get us to the end of the game.
[519:13.38]Dude, what the fuck?
[519:14.58]Check him.
[519:15.32]Dude, why are you not checking him?
[519:20.47]Where are they?

[519:59.82]I do have a friend now, which I'm good with this.
[520:02.34]Now we gotta... I still have two more hangars to do.
[520:09.75]Where the fuck are these other hangars?
[520:15.75]I still have a key that I haven't used, do I?
[520:19.39]Reed's gonna betray us.
[520:21.33]Okay, I can go this way or that way.
[520:22.83]I can go up.
[520:23.51]Let's go up.
[520:31.97]Should've looked.
[520:39.94]Easy.
[520:41.20]Shh.
[520:49.04]Slow down.
[520:50.72]There's a big guy up here.
[520:54.64]Big guy, big guy, big guy, big guy.
[520:56.50]Don't get in my way like the last one.
[521:00.40]Don't get in my way like the last one.
[521:11.48]Nothing in here.
[521:14.58]Sniper ammo?
[521:16.52]Oh, there are the other hangars.
[521:18.59]Okay, sniper.
[521:20.57]Sounds good to me.
[521:31.04]I tried to fire the gun at least five times.
[521:40.19]Okay.
[521:44.01]Other side.
[521:51.46]Last two hangars.
[521:53.74]Let's go.
[521:56.94]Nothing up here, though.
[522:10.27]No, this way.
[522:14.25]Ah, blood everywhere.
[522:15.27]This doesn't look good.
[522:17.37]I'll pull it together.
[522:20.94]He's dying.
[522:21.56]There he is.
[522:22.16]OK.
[522:22.26]Hey, hey, hey.
[522:23.50]Back, back, back.
[522:26.36]Watch out.
[522:27.40]Don't.
[522:27.64]Get out of the way.
[522:28.32]Get out of that way.
[522:32.04]This doesn't look good.
[522:38.95]Reed, with me.
[522:40.43]Reed.
[522:48.41]Reed.
[522:48.89]Reed.
[522:49.47]Reed.
[522:49.89]Yes, Reed.
[522:50.49]Move.
[522:51.41]Reed.
[522:51.69]I don't want to have you explode like the last person.
[522:57.73]In fact, get over here.
[523:00.43]Reed, just stand here.
[523:02.89]Yes, sir.
[523:14.09]Okay, now, let's go.
[523:17.82]He's very hurt.
[523:24.74]Back out.
[523:26.70]Out, out, out, out, out.
[523:29.28]It would look better if you would face the enemy.
[523:31.38]Ay-yi-yi.
[523:37.27]Oh my goodness.
[523:38.49]Safe point.
[523:45.05]Beautiful.
[523:47.91]But who cares?
[523:48.51]I already did this.
[523:58.05]I guess there's just a save point up here, but who cares?
[524:03.55]What does that do for me?
[524:04.29]I have to go, like, down, but...
[524:13.33]Alright.
[524:13.81]I guess I'm just gonna go... It just saves the game.
[524:17.58]Apparently, it just saves the game.
[524:23.60]Okay.
[524:30.00]Oh, no.
[524:31.60]Is he turning?
[524:34.46]Reid?
[524:35.04]Are you alright?
[524:36.22]Reid.
[524:37.14]I'm gonna need you to come over here.
[524:38.32]Here, have some ammo.
[524:39.14]That makes people feel better, right?
[524:42.19]Here.
[524:43.35]Feel better?
[524:44.99]Yeah.
[524:46.05]Good.
[524:53.31]Alright, so which way do I need to go?
[524:54.37]I need to go out and around?
[524:58.32]Because I have to go to the other hangar.
[525:06.82]Can I not open this door?
[525:12.06]Data room three.
[525:14.00]I guess this way?
[525:16.27]Because wasn't I down here already, though?
[525:19.75]I was down here already.
[525:21.07]This door didn't open.
[525:25.50]I have to get to where the planes are, but... How do I get out and then... Because this thing is in the way.
[525:41.78]Soft locked?
[525:42.44]No, I don't think so.
[525:46.07]It's not soft locked, is it?
[525:47.31]No, I gotta go the other way.
[525:57.21]I gotta go that way.
[525:58.05]I already did these two.
[525:59.83]I have to... You need... I think you need the engineer.
[526:06.68]Really?
[526:06.92]No, I was already here.
[526:07.66]Can I go around?
[526:09.96]Can I go around?
[526:23.11]What soft luck.
[526:28.53]Let's go.
[526:28.91]I want that Medic, though.
[526:36.63]He may have run off.
[526:39.27]I think the Medic ran off.
[526:41.99]Did you just give another $275?
[526:43.35]Ishanji has given a...
[526:53.38]nine hundred and ninety dollars and fifty four almost a thousand dollars this nishanji that's unbelievable oh my god I'm gonna die I've been trying to get flaccid locked trending over soft locked all stream but no takers what gives should I stop trying to make flaccid locks happen what he what what he's talking about

[527:28.50]Um... Oh, he's back.
[527:30.22]Good.

[527:34.94]How can I lag it again?
[527:35.80]It's not online.
[527:37.50]But seriously, Ishanji, that's... A thousand dollars is more money than I think anyone should be ever expected.

[528:43.67]Is he faster than me?
[528:51.58]Holy shit, okay.
[528:56.71]Worst item in any game.
[528:57.65]That's right.
[528:59.37]Phylactery has crossed the $1,000 mark with that last $250.
[529:03.85]25,000 bits.
[529:08.42]Flaccid Locked Gun.
[529:09.50]That's right.
[529:12.76]Take a look at the top bits right now and just look at that absurd number.

[529:52.49]This stream actually paid for the Halloween stream.
[529:55.71]Like, just full on, no doubt.
[529:59.99]This stream right here paid for the Halloween stream.
[530:03.88]Absolutely.
[530:06.82]So there's that one.
[530:13.36]Give us a little spoiler.
[530:16.48]Spoiler for the Halloween stream?
[530:21.78]No, that's not fun.
[530:23.68]You just know that it's going to be a secret slime stream.
[530:29.28]All four are there.
[530:29.90]Find sniper spot to shoot C4.
[530:31.68]I know where that is.
[530:32.37]It's up there.
[530:36.33]Already found that one.
[530:47.35]Just hope I can get it back to where I was.
[530:48.99]I killed everything, though, so that should be fine.
[530:56.20]If it's Bugleberry again, I'm unsubscribing.
[531:06.70]I don't know.
[531:07.44]I don't know.
[531:16.31]I don't know who is and isn't going to make appearances on every stream.
[531:19.79]Could be anybody.
[531:27.64]Is Bugleberry the weird mask?
[531:31.32]Not a very nice way to talk about somebody.
[531:34.96]I mean, just going to be honest.
[531:42.30]What happened?
[531:43.62]I wanna save these.
[531:44.92]Oh, this is gonna be awful.
[531:45.76]I need to save.
[531:46.38]I'm not doing this until I save the game.
[532:18.11]Okay.
[532:19.13]Now I'm ready.
[532:26.87]Why?
[532:27.09]That didn't... I just shot the wheels off.
[532:29.56]I thought there was going to be explosions.
[532:43.78]One more, and then what?
[532:48.45]Oh, here come all the guards.
[532:50.19]Escape.
[532:53.37]Escape to where?
[532:54.72]Where am I supposed to escape to?
[532:58.86]Escape.
[533:09.07]How did you get in here already?
[533:19.01]Oh, fuck.
[533:28.66]Save it.
[533:32.94]I'm a save psycho right now.
[533:35.96]None of them even fired a shot.
[533:37.32]No.
[533:38.76]I just went nyo.
[533:40.52]Oh, nyo.
[533:42.62]Alright.
[533:52.35]Watch it.
[533:54.07]Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[534:00.13]Did that feel exceptionally long to anybody else?
[534:15.18]Where am I supposed to escape to?
[534:48.34]Okay.
[534:51.04]Oh well.
[534:57.68]I was very- I was within two full rooms.
[535:08.80]Here we go.
[535:13.43]I was so far away from you!
[535:18.15]Wait, these are super grenades, that's why.
[535:22.28]These are super grenades.
[535:44.52]Die!
[535:44.88]Look at you die!
[535:46.38]The hardest enemies in the game are the fucking tiny little shitheads.
[535:50.10]Is this door open now?
[536:13.02]It is.
[536:27.81]Gain access to the armory.
[536:46.90]There's more?
[536:49.71]How much more is there?
[536:50.75]This has been going on nine hours!
[536:56.09]I thought this game was supposed to be like six.
[536:58.95]I thought it was supposed to be like a six-hour game.
[537:00.81]Um, something's back there.
[537:18.44]What?
[537:19.86]Ow.
[537:23.53]This is...
[537:32.03]I'm gonna die There are two more bosses in this game, how is this game nine hours?
[537:50.65]There's two more bosses
[538:00.51]So this is technically five hours in the game.
[538:11.04]Does anybody know... Oh, come on.
[538:12.88]Do I really have to do this whole thing again?
[538:14.55]I'm just gonna run.
[538:15.35]What's the point of even fighting it?
[538:17.17]Just save time, save money, and go.
[538:22.87]Alright, so, let me ask, has anybody beaten this game in this chat?
[538:28.07]Do I actually have, like, less than 15, 20 minutes?
[538:32.05]Or is this, like, do I have, like, another couple hours?
[538:43.34]Not that long?
[538:45.74]Six, six more minutes.
[538:48.36]Still at your, well, I'm in the tutorial still, okay.
[538:54.51]I'll see how far I get in the next 15 minutes.
[538:59.43]Because I do have to, like, I have to, like, I do have to go.
[539:02.78]I have some stuff I need to do internally.
[539:07.66]Let's see if I can get by this.
[539:10.11]Without firing a shot.
[539:27.65]Because it's a loading screen.
[539:28.83]You know what I mean?
[539:30.97]It's not like I, oh no, they're behind me.
[539:32.49]No, it's just a loading screen.
[539:37.20]Right here, see?
[539:39.14]So why even fight it?
[539:41.64]Alright.
[539:42.60]Let me try to- it's- it's getting late, and I'm really not supposed to be streaming this long.
[539:48.42]For medical reasons.
[539:50.94]So, I'll give this like another one or two attempts, and then we can- I can finish it when I come back.
[539:56.95]I definitely don't have that much, like, left, so.
[540:04.30]First of all, what is in here?
[540:05.88]Is it an elevator?
[540:09.15]This is an elevator.
[540:12.31]First time I've heard that lady's voice.
[540:16.07]I can go in there.
[540:16.91]Oh, there's somebody.
[540:17.87]Look at this.
[540:18.23]This guy's just... Can I just shoot a grenade through the window?
[540:25.02]I can't break this window.
[540:25.84]Did that hurt him?
[540:32.90]Oh, fuck.
[540:48.31]Burn!
[540:48.73]Alright, he's running.
[540:55.87]One more?
[540:56.21]I need fuel.
[541:04.55]Alright.
[541:08.34]Safe point in there?
[541:12.14]Hope so.
[541:12.74]Nope, but there's a lot of stuff in here.
[541:18.35]Okay, fire extinguisher.
[541:19.55]A lot of heals.
[541:23.23]Tons of grenades, shotgun ammo, incendiaries.
[541:29.63]Back up to ten.
[541:30.51]I got two of these.
[541:33.11]Perfect dab, Jupiter.
[541:35.97]Pretty good.
[541:37.73]Alright.
[541:42.70]I've got plenty of stuff.
[541:55.77]Oh, come on.
[542:01.85]Ah!
[542:03.09]Okay.
[542:04.40]Why are you still... I hate those things.
[542:08.84]Can I be real?
[542:13.16]I guess I'm going this way.
[542:20.08]If we're not at the final sequence here... Like, final boss.
[542:39.58]Coming up.
[542:40.00]Like, after I go through here.
[542:42.20]Hello.
[542:42.58]Hello.
[542:51.45]I just got jumped.
[543:03.26]Okay, where are we?
[543:07.46]What?
[543:08.38]Stop, stop, stop running!
[543:09.70]Where are you going?
[543:12.18]Come here!
[543:13.98]Give me a weapon.
[543:14.60]Why are you... What are you doing?
[543:26.50]What a moron.
[543:29.00]Come here.
[543:31.56]Take one.
[543:34.12]Cohen.
[543:35.72]Here they come.
[543:41.57]Kill it.
[543:43.13]Can't go up.
[543:43.71]Wait, I can go up here.
[543:55.13]That it?
[543:57.79]I mean, she's a medic.
[544:00.26]I'm not gonna give this guy the grenade launcher.
[544:02.34]Alright, I can go up here.
[544:12.95]But why?
[544:24.39]Apparently that hurt.
[544:25.28]What about my friend?
[544:34.18]Oh, alright.
[544:36.54]I guess I could just... Watch out for the gas.
[544:46.45]Does it hurt?
[544:49.01]It does hurt.
[544:49.89]I knew it was gonna hurt.
[544:50.89]You're okay.
[544:51.77]Come here.
[544:52.75]Well, why would... Why would you walk into it again?
[544:59.66]That's a machine gun.
[545:14.64]Burn.
[545:18.99]This guy talked, he was talking, it wasn't just like some random guy staring at the camera.
[545:28.82]There's a turret down there.
[545:46.43]I just... I felt myself rolling my eyes and I stopped.
[545:50.36]I still have plenty of health.
[545:54.58]Alright, give me my shit back.
[545:55.64]You don't deserve it.
[545:56.92]I'm not a real friend.
[545:58.00]I have to go down the vent, don't I?
[546:16.04]that I gotta go through the vent and around somehow or I gotta throw a grenade down there I'm just gonna kill me isn't it still alive
[546:43.10]See, even when they're, like, burning to death, they'll still get, like, a 10% damage hit on you.
[546:47.49]Alright, now I have to heal, because the... Alright, next save point, I'm gonna...
[547:12.57]Oh, will you fuck off?
[547:18.48]How many are there?
[547:19.42]Alright, you know, delete like 60% of these things from the game and they would be like a fucking more of a better score.
[547:29.75]Hello?
[547:41.11]Why is the whole pet store coming after me right now?
[547:44.67]What the fuck?
[547:49.09]What?
[547:58.59]Is that it?
[547:59.05]Or is it like another 40 of these little fucking snots that are gonna come running at me?
[548:04.29]I almost just died.
[548:10.61]Didn't even need to do that.
[548:12.73]Don't catch fire back here, please.
[548:18.43]Do I have a fire extinguisher?
[548:23.65]I have plenty of them.
[548:32.36]Almost done.
[548:33.50]No, I'm not, not even close.
[548:36.98]I just gotta get to a save point.
[548:39.50]Just get me to a save point, please.
[549:07.22]Is that still... Okay.
[549:10.32]It's time to call bullshit when you see it.
[549:13.10]Alright, this is gonna be dangerous.
[549:29.91]Yep, okay.
[549:31.77]What the f- It's unnecessary.
[549:38.39]It's unnecessary.
[549:40.70]Unnecessary.
[549:44.26]It's just unnecessary.
[549:52.00]I hope I got it.
[549:58.12]Nope!
[550:09.06]Unnecessary.
[550:12.68]I even waited, too.
[550:13.48]I... I even waited.
[550:18.26]Like, the hitbox on it is just all fucked up.
[550:22.80]I'm so... I... I don't understand.
[550:24.49]Why... Don't you just walk into that when you're making the game and go, Oh, this sucks.
[550:38.23]What the fuck?
[550:39.65]Where did you even come from?
[550:42.47]Where did you come from?
[550:43.27]And is this thing still alive?
[550:45.35]Oh, no.
[550:51.28]They're just coming through the fucking walls.
[550:53.68]My bad.
[550:54.88]They're like coming through the concrete.
[550:59.91]They're going through the concrete.
[551:08.36]Is there a range on... Is there a fucking range on when... Look how far back this is.
[551:39.81]That's it.
[551:43.49]Okay, I just tried to run.
[551:45.72]Just run.
[551:46.22]Just run through.
[551:47.72]And the guy was this big, filled up the hole.
[551:50.04]I couldn't run by him.
[551:50.96]I'd just die.
[551:59.73]Last one.
[552:00.09]This is the last one.
[552:00.95]This is the last try.
[552:02.43]This is actually truly the last try.
[552:04.73]And then that's it.
[552:05.21]Then I actually really have to go.
[552:07.99]Let's go.
[552:08.47]I'm gonna make this quick.
[552:21.88]He needs banana laxatives.
[552:37.28]I actually have to take them.
[552:42.13]Dude, the enemy AI is just doesn't... is so strange.
[552:48.63]Like, what are you doing?
[552:52.74]It's so hard to determine, because it's almost like they're... it's like randomized.
[552:56.66]If the thing's gonna run away.
[552:57.84]I'm gonna throw some weapons gray laxatives at this fucking person.
[553:03.36]Just put it on easy.
[553:05.33]Yeah, it is on hard right now.
[553:06.67]That's true.
[553:15.74]It is on hard.
[553:19.04]But I started it on hard.
[553:20.54]I'm about to beat it on hard.
[553:22.00]I'm just gonna try to sprint.
[553:27.81]Yes, it's been on hard the whole time.
[553:29.11]I'm just gonna try to go fast.
[553:36.19]I know what I need to do.
[553:39.46]Fuck it, you know what I'm saying?
[553:42.31]See you guys in a few days.
[553:58.60]Oh, I would be so upset.
[554:06.52]I just have to go fast.
[554:08.96]Excuse me.
[554:10.34]I've got somewhere to go.
[554:12.61]Hold mouse button down.
[554:54.73]I'm outta here.
[554:55.35]I'm fuckin' outta here.
[554:56.97]I'll see you guys in a few days.
[555:01.29]Get off of me!
[555:03.23]Oh, I'm... Everything's on fire.
[555:19.65]Oh shit.
[555:24.55]I need the fire extinguisher.
[555:27.50]Okay, everything's on fire.
[555:30.76]Didn't I just kill him?
[555:39.23]No, no, you can't run fast through this.
[555:48.11]I just turned into the toxic Avenger.
[555:50.59]See you guys later.
[555:59.47]Yeah, it's been too long.
[556:02.13]I'll see you guys later.
[556:03.11]I'm having fun, but I was not supposed to stream for this long.
[556:11.00]My stomach is actually bothering me.
[556:13.90]So...
[556:15.48]We will finish it.
[556:17.44]Not tomorrow.
[556:18.02]I'm gonna be gone for a couple days.
[556:19.98]I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow and that's why I have to go too because I have to stay on this regimen to be able to talk to the doctor tomorrow and tell him everything that's going on, right?
[556:29.89]And go for a follow-up.
[556:32.19]So I'll be back.
[556:33.83]When am I gonna be back?
[556:34.45]Let's see.
[556:36.13]Because I want to stream like three or four days before doing the Halloween stream and I have to leave for the Halloween stream.
[556:47.93]What the fuck?
[556:48.45]Alright, we're going to get off of this screen because it's scaring the shit out of me.
[556:58.99]Does the top sub thing work?
[557:07.62]Holy shit.
[557:10.81]Yeah, thanks for sticking around.
[557:11.61]It's a late one, I know.
[557:13.61]I would push through and do like a 10 plus hour stream, but I can't physically.
[557:19.03]I'm really not supposed to be doing that.
[557:22.63]I need to go use the bathroom and go take more of this fucking molasses.
[557:31.89]So I'll see you guys.
[557:32.83]What's today?
[557:33.29]Today's Monday.
[557:33.99]I'll probably see you guys again on...
[557:38.68]Let me see.
[557:39.98]One, two.
[557:43.64]I'll see you guys again on Thursday.
[557:48.56]So I'll be off tomorrow and Wednesday.
[557:52.65]And then I'll be back and we'll do Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[557:56.39]So I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[557:59.15]So on Thursday, we're going to probably finish the thing.
[558:05.44]And then after, I mean, I can't imagine it'll take more than another hour or so.
[558:09.65]So finish the thing and then we're gonna do Parappa the Rapper and Parappa the Rapper 2.
[558:17.95]I got a weird kind of shift there, I know.
[558:22.88]But if you think about it, Parappa the Rapper and both those two games are like one to two hours long each.
[558:31.32]So if there's like an hour or two left of the thing or like an hour left of the thing,
[558:35.94]Talking about it'll be like about five, six hours total.
[558:38.64]So that works out pretty well.
[558:41.70]Looking forward to it.
[558:44.78]So I will see you guys in a couple days.
[558:48.36]Unfortunately, I cannot do the bits right now because I really do have to go.
[558:54.92]I didn't think I was going to go this long.
[558:56.45]But what will happen is like we do sometimes, I'm going to go over the bits on... Holy shit, there's so many.
[559:08.15]We'll do this before, and this could actually be a pretty good thing to do.
[559:16.52]Yeah, and this would be good to end it.
[559:18.92]Or even to begin it.
[559:22.70]Because this will probably take about an hour or so to do.
[559:25.54]And I can't.
[559:27.13]I just physically cannot.
[559:27.99]I'm sorry.
[559:30.55]But something that we will do is at least take a look at some of the credits.
[559:35.97]And I do have to say thank you, everybody.
[559:38.66]For all the ridiculous contributions.
[559:40.54]Let me see if this works.
[559:44.82]It does.
[559:48.28]270 gifted subs.
[559:51.16]From File Directory.
[559:51.86]Holy shit.
[559:57.78]I think it might even be more than that.
[560:00.90]So let's do the credits.
[560:03.82]We'll pick up on these bits on Thursday.
[560:05.24]Sorry, I know I typically go over them.
[560:08.12]All of them.
[560:10.81]But you know, gotta do what you gotta do.
[560:13.38]I do appreciate every single one of them, though.
[560:15.66]And there were a fucking lot of them.
[560:17.26]There were a lot of them.
[560:22.00]Strap yourselves in for the credits.
[560:24.79]This is gonna be... bonkers.
[560:30.27]Let's see what happens.
[560:31.03]I don't even know what's gonna happen.
[560:50.97]That's never gone that fast.
[560:54.31]Ever.
[560:55.09]That's a... You're looking at, like, potentially 14... 13, 14, 1500 names.
[561:04.96]You can't even see.
[561:08.44]Read them.
[561:09.90]I'll see if I can get one.
[561:16.38]Merlin.
[561:17.12]Thanks a lot, Merlin.
[561:19.34]And...
[561:23.25]Uh, Craig.
[561:25.11]Nice job, Craig.
[561:26.67]Thanks for the sub.
[561:30.73]You guys, I can't comprehend this.
[561:34.61]I can't comprehend it.
[561:37.74]Years later, months later, doesn't matter, I still can't believe it.
[561:46.88]Thank you.
[561:50.14]This is still going.
[561:55.04]I didn't think credits went by this fast at the movie theater.
[562:01.31]Special thanks to all the people that worked on this movie.
[562:03.27]There were like 5,000 people on set.
[562:11.77]It's still going.
[562:17.67]This is the Kickstarter... This is bigger than a Kickstarter backer list.
[562:29.88]Oh my god.
[562:36.92]It's almost like I feel like it's not this many.
[562:41.41]And it repeated or something, but no, that's legit.
[562:48.34]Thank you guys, for real.
[562:51.94]I'd love to stick around.
[562:52.70]I really was hoping I could power through it.
[562:55.95]But I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[562:56.81]We'll do a bunch of stuff.
[562:57.59]We'll do Parappa.
[562:58.25]We'll do these bits at the end.
[563:00.00]We'll just do like a big chill hangout session.
[563:07.02]Thank you again for the thousands of dollars and subs.
[563:15.96]I am gonna go take some medication for my stomach.
[563:21.25]And go relax and go to the doctor tomorrow.
[563:25.99]Much love to you guys, seriously.
[563:29.52]Hope you guys liked the thing.
[563:30.54]It was fun.
[563:31.22]I didn't really complain that much about it until we got to the Steam.
[563:35.72]But I'm having fun with it.
[563:37.70]I definitely want to see it to the end.
[563:42.36]See you guys soon.
[563:43.78]Take care of yourselves.
[563:46.85]Ads, ads.
[563:47.49]Alright, I will run... I will run ads.
[563:51.79]Okay?
[563:56.33]I'm gonna run three minutes of ads right now.
[563:59.45]Is that what you want?
[564:00.15]For real?
[564:01.68]I guess... Alright, I guess I'll do it.
[564:03.70]Have a wonderful rest of... I can't run an hour worth of ads.
[564:07.86]There's only... Yeah, everyone's a sub now anyways.
[564:12.38]Maybe 15 of you are gonna get these.
[564:16.18]Finally, some good fucking content.
[564:18.29]Alright.
[564:19.75]Now, see you guys in a few days.
[564:21.41]Take care.
[564:21.85]Much love.
[564:23.95]Have a great night.

[565:02.91]That's a long time.
[565:10.00]Now he has to stay here and watch the ads.
[565:17.34]Let's talk about non-subs.
[565:22.02]They can't hear us.
[565:23.11]Unless they have adblock.
[565:30.39]Is this some joke I don't understand?
[565:32.62]Um... No, it just... Everyone demanded... I saw that everyone demands ads sometimes.
[565:40.55]I guess it is a joke.
[565:41.83]Because... Nobody wants to watch ads.
[565:53.43]I do.
[565:54.13]It's serious.
[565:55.13]I do.
[565:55.91]I do.
[565:56.77]I got a Pringles ad, smiley face.
[565:59.67]Pringles are pretty good.
[566:01.99]If Chad asked you to poop yourself, would you do it?
[566:04.38]No, I would not.
[566:10.98]Why would I do that?
[566:11.72]I don't know.
[566:19.77]My sub just ran out, so I'm getting... Oh my fucking god.
[566:24.57]Do you guys have any idea?
[566:25.64]It was... It's like 1,500 subs tonight.
[566:30.98]A little bit more.
[566:33.48]I cannot... I can't even look at that number and believe it.
[566:50.13]Seriously.
[566:54.31]Term I walked in on my mom and dad.
[566:56.05]What do I do?
[566:57.83]On what?

[567:22.64]Will you tell Kim the good news?
[567:23.76]Oh, she already knows.
[567:26.43]She was like, I need you to move this desk.
[567:27.83]And I go out there and I'm like, what am I doing?
[567:30.77]Why do we need to move a desk right now?
