[00:01.29]Alrighty, alright.
[00:02.41]Let's change in the title and we can go.
[00:04.21]Let's see if I can get to round 50.
[00:07.53]That's my cam.
[00:24.70]Is the cam still fucked up?
[00:28.70]I'm not just going to go right into it.
[00:30.40]I'm not just going to jump into it.
[00:31.48]I need practice.
[00:33.52]It's a camera.
[00:41.13]Practice.
[00:42.69]I'm going to go here.
[00:44.69]I'm going to go.
[00:47.77]I lost all my points believing in you.
[00:52.33]You can't just go right into super hard.
[00:54.17]I need like a 10 to 20 minute get my brain going again.
[01:02.85]I forget what half these guys even do.
[01:03.91]Alright, let's do it.
[01:15.11]3 o'clock.
[01:20.43]I just read a shitty comment in a sea of handsome streamers.
[01:23.57]Escape!
[01:32.75]Knock this fucking thing again.
[01:35.23]Did I do it?
[01:36.61]Alright, I was gonna say what the hell.
[01:38.78]Knock that up, right?
[01:59.76]I... I can't change... It's the sounds of the game, man.
[02:05.51]I'm feeling... I'm getting warmed up.
[02:09.19]I'm feeling the juices flow.
[02:34.27]It's because I have the baby color on.
[02:37.83]Oh, you're talking about that frog noise.
[02:41.21]That's it, right?
[02:50.37]I don't understand that one.
[02:51.95]Do you have to just keep doing it?
[03:01.08]It has to be consistent speed.
[03:09.48]Alright, can't have your boss.
[03:20.64]Basecamp is delayed?
[03:21.90]Yeah, I... I can try to fix it in a minute.
[03:24.34]Hold on.
[03:25.04]Alright.
[03:25.66]Canister.
[03:26.56]Juice.
[03:28.10]Hat.
[03:28.44]Backpack.
[03:29.22]Canister.
[03:29.68]Juice.
[03:30.30]Hat.
[03:30.66]Backpack.
[03:31.80]Backpack.
[03:32.42]Something in my throat.
[03:41.42]I need a canister.
[03:49.79]I need a hat and a back hat and mug.
[04:01.56]I definitely can fix it by doing something here.
[04:04.76]Oh, shit.
[04:05.52]No, no, no.
[04:05.80]Put this back.
[04:09.35]Yeah, it's a canister.
[04:12.77]The cockroach just keeps freaking me out.
[04:19.94]Get that fucking cockroach out of here, it's annoying.
[04:29.88]Baby noise is giving us suffering.
[04:31.77]You're gonna be fine.
[04:50.19]Oh, that's a lot.
[04:51.55]150.
[04:51.69]One sec.
[04:52.10]I had- I had way more time than I thought I did.
[04:59.20]What time is it?
[05:00.06]Move over!
[05:01.06]I thought I had the- ugh.
[05:22.77]I thought I had more... I thought I didn't have enough time to do that.
[05:25.43]I couldn't move the damn thing.
[05:33.17]Alright, I'm good.
[05:34.07]Got it.
[05:51.67]That's one of the dwarves from the Hobbit movie.
[05:55.07]Get it!
[05:55.63]The baby noise is funny.
[05:58.76]I'm not even hearing it.
[05:59.70]My lip gloss is whatever it is.
[06:19.70]Oh, that was close.
[06:28.49]My game's not muted.
[06:29.47]I know, it's like a... Okay.
[06:31.67]I don't like that one.
[06:37.43]That one sucks.
[06:41.79]I might get to 50 on this one.
[06:44.85]He's gotta get one of those.
[06:46.31]Nice bit rate.
[06:47.33]I am screaming.
[07:11.66]I'm streaming at the maximum bitrate that Twitch allows.
[07:16.60]Okay, mug mug.
[07:25.69]Complete package.
[07:34.54]864p.
[07:36.10]864p is the resolution, not the bitrate.
[07:40.48]Oh, I thought we had some smart people here.
[07:43.20]Alright, what we got?
[07:50.74]Red.
[08:04.47]Why don't you have 4K streams?
[08:07.35]Because if I streamed in 4K with a 6,000 bitrate, it would look like I threw up all over your screen.
[08:11.65]Guys, 1080p at 60 FPS with 6,000 bitrate does not look good.
[08:13.77]Get the fuck out of here.
[08:31.89]Okay, it was blue, blue.
[08:33.20]Okay, blue, blue.
[08:34.70]1080p 30, you can do okay with.
[08:40.61]I don't know.
[08:41.05]I think a 1080p video at 60 FPS, you need like a 10,000 bitrate for that to look okay.
[09:07.55]Don't you have 3090?
[09:08.47]That does not really... It's just about what Twitch has for their limitations.
[09:15.84]I could stream Nvank with my 3090, and I can't get out?
[09:20.50]I can't leave?
[09:20.96]It's still the limitation of 6000 bitrate.
[09:25.30]I could run as slow as possible in coding, but that doesn't really do anything.
[09:33.19]The actual CPU preset and the N-Veg presets, they're... Once you go past medium, there's really not a real discernible difference at all.
[09:51.24]You can go beyond 6k, you have to enable it in OBS.
[09:54.81]I mean, I could physically do it, but it's against Twitch's guidelines.
[09:58.93]If I could stream right now with, like, 20k bitrate, and I would get- Twitch would turn my channel off, I'd get in trouble.
[10:06.67]What?
[10:06.83]Prince.
[10:16.97]I got him.
[10:17.69]Can you stream with a 60 FPS camera?
[10:19.99]Well, here's the thing.
[10:24.43]I don't... The reason why my camera's not at 60 FPS right now is because my fucking camera is... Whatever.
[10:34.86]You fucked me all up.
[10:36.20]Whatever.
[10:36.78]Listen.
[10:38.02]I can do it, but it's... Look.
[10:39.32]Watch what happens.
[10:40.00]39.
[10:40.80]Whatever.
[10:41.70]I don't care.
[10:49.42]So, I have to have my exposure up really high, because I don't use webcams that frequently, I don't really care.
[10:56.94]So my exposure has to go up, but when you let more light in, when you pull more light into these webcams, you're opening up the iris, so the frame rate just gets annihilated.
[11:06.70]Ready?
[11:06.88]Watch this.
[11:13.96]I just turned it all off, and I have to restart the camera.
[11:20.10]It's not going to go through here.
[11:21.06]Here we go.
[11:23.64]Watch this, ready?
[11:29.45]Now the camera has to restart.
[11:36.82]I have to restart the camera.
[11:39.20]Well, you can blame... So here's the thing.
[11:41.04]I've talked shit about this in the past.
[11:44.44]I really don't know why every webcam, even like the UI for the webcams, like controls and stuff, are stuck in like 2003.
[11:50.50]It got a little better.
[11:56.74]Are we going to get like technology that's not based in like 2004, 2005 for a webcam?
[12:08.22]Why did they just stop developing better quality webcams?
[12:11.42]Did they just think?
[12:12.26]Did they realize that nobody really cares after 1080 or after, like, 720?
[12:16.08]That, like, an overexposed, like, kind of sloppy, shitty exposure is... I don't understand.
[12:19.81]Why is it... Why are we stuck in 2006?
[12:20.85]Use a DSLR?
[12:25.25]I don't want to set up a gigantic DSLR and have a convoluted system to plug it into my... so I could do a high-quality camera on my stream.
[12:35.05]I just want technology from like 2016.
[12:41.68]Use your phone?
[12:46.70]Look, I'm back in 60 FPS, or at least close to it.
[12:52.26]Company has software for the camera.
[12:55.15]Low quality camera adds to your charm.
[12:58.37]No, look.
[13:00.49]I'm not going to set up a setup like that.
[13:05.26]For like the four times a year I turn my webcam on for more than 20 minutes?
[13:09.80]No, I don't want to do this again.
[13:21.33]Let's go.
[13:22.37]I'm warmed up.
[13:28.53]Don't you have the money for it?
[13:31.21]Just because something is possible does not mean it should be done.
[13:36.78]What, because I can like set up a DSLR over here and have like this elaborate- I don't want that in my room!
[13:43.58]No, I don't wa- I don't want it!
[13:45.08]Alright, here we go.
[13:54.53]I'm so psycho.
[13:59.37]I don't want you guys to see any of this shit about my face or whatever.
[14:01.67]Alright, we're going right into it, super hard.
[14:10.17]Alright.
[14:11.11]Ooh, that little jug down there almost screwed it all up.
[14:15.37]Patrick!
[14:15.75]This guy sucks!
[14:16.33]Alright.
[14:16.69]Alright.
[14:38.83]Get in it!
[15:10.57]How the fuck am I supposed to do that?
[15:12.59]Holy shit, how did I get to 47 last night?
[15:14.65]I have no idea.
[15:17.56]How on Earth did I do that?
[15:23.14]Oh, Ashley's not in here, you're right.
[15:34.31]Washed up from one day ago.
[15:42.77]Part 2.
[15:42.97]Nooo!
[15:46.34]I'm not warmed up at all.
[15:47.62]I have to do one more side- okay.
[15:54.06]That team sucked.
[15:54.82]It was a bad team.
[15:56.32]I was a bad team.
[15:59.04]Now I got the good team.
[16:00.02]I got the good team.
[16:01.50]I'm ready to go.
[16:04.07]Change the character noises.
[16:05.47]I will.
[16:05.91]After like five more attempts, I promise.
[16:08.87]Okay, I gotta lean back and relax.
[16:13.31]I'm leaning back and relaxing.
[16:14.73]Watch.
[16:15.07]Find it.
[16:19.16]I had to go above.
[16:21.10]Holy shit, I'm lost.
[16:22.44]Trees.
[16:23.68]That'll do.
[16:28.02]Of course.
[16:29.28]Light.
[16:30.14]Perfection.
[16:32.63]Rinse.
[16:33.95]I got moves.
[16:35.93]Look closely.
[16:48.71]Oh, he's holding a paper airplane!
[17:23.03]oh come on what oh my fucking god why shit some of these some of these this fast are impossible some of these minigames this fast are actually like not even possible with the 2D characters
[18:01.02]Alright, we're going original.
[18:07.74]Alright, let's try this.
[18:13.48]Getting better?
[18:13.98]I gotta warm up.
[18:16.56]The ones where it's like, rock the baby, they give you like a full one second.
[18:28.42]You get, like, maybe a tenth of a second.
[18:29.94]You gotta rock up, like, eight times.
[18:31.28]Alright, it's the last car.
[18:38.06]Oh!
[18:38.14]Oh!
[19:23.32]Oh my god, stop!
[19:24.86]I'm not getting electrocuted, I'm fine!
[19:55.86]That's cheating?
[19:56.54]How?
[20:02.37]I didn't hear!
[20:34.65]That's not fucking possible.
[20:35.73]That's not possible.
[20:40.71]Seriously, the time- the wait for the beat?
[20:44.92]Like, how the fuck are you supposed to do that?
[20:48.22]Oh, I get the rhythm here.
[20:51.36]Huh?
[20:56.84]Let's begin!
[20:57.42]Protect!
[20:57.58]Perfection!
[20:57.82]Finish!
[20:58.02]You bet!
[20:58.36]Spin it!
[20:58.78]Watch out!
[21:24.57]I wanna see- I- I wanna see the clip where that hit me.
[21:32.39]I'd like to see the hitbox.
[21:34.10]I wanna see the clip where that hit me.
[21:45.20]De-sync- I'm not de-synced.
[21:50.77]No.
[21:51.35]It's a shitty- Watch.
[22:01.92]Do not desync.
[22:03.34]You're a liar.
[22:10.63]The desync is a shitty webcam that can't be in a room that doesn't have a fucking gigantic ring light in your face.
[22:20.34]Let me see, let me see, what happened?
[22:26.28]It's the webcam just sucks.
[22:27.80]And this is not even an old webcam.
[22:32.68]I actually don't mind the guys going that way.
[22:51.87]He looks pissed.
[22:53.02]I'm pissed at webcam technology.
[22:57.14]I have an opinion that they just made all the webcams they've ever made 10 years ago and just didn't make anymore.
[23:15.51]Okay, the worst part about why are you aware for switch is because they've changed because you have to be the 2D character It's like you move the character and like it's a lot of these minigames You need to take like a second to know where to move But like you you have to move and we're so quickly within like a second That's like how the fuck am I supposed to do that without?
[23:41.96]Like, all these minigames require you to control a 2D character jumping around.
[23:46.00]But if you move even a small amount in that minigame, you fucking ruin the whole thing.
[23:51.14]Fucking GameCube one was better.
[24:05.80]Listen to the prompt.
[24:06.62]Okay.
[24:07.44]Let me tell you something about the prompt.
[24:09.30]You ready for the prompt?
[24:10.80]If I screamed in your ear an action for you to do, I scream in your ear, and you have two-tenths of a second to do that action, you're gonna freak out.
[24:23.54]You're gonna be like, what did he say?
[24:26.30]What number?
[24:27.34]And I'm gonna laugh at you when you get it wrong.
[24:46.82]He's like, you see what I mean?
[24:49.12]Like, what the fuck, man?
[25:51.56]They're just moving the character around It's like moving the character physically across the plane like it's just like it's what the fuck Like I have to go up and around into the left Take a seat
[26:21.16]Here we go Come on
[26:58.56]God damn it.
[26:59.32]I've tried to oh You see what I mean, thank you.
[27:04.56]It's like moving the characters around itself.
[27:08.06]Oh
[27:25.51]Fucking God, I hate it!
[28:04.80]It's this one Protect
[28:40.09]Teddy bear!
[29:26.62]needing to know like what side you have to move the character is so fucking painful it's like okay so right at the very beginning you gotta move quick either left or right with everybody so it's like alright what is the game what's going on and what direction do I have to hold the analog protect
[29:57.09]I had it Might fuck around and believe in Jerma
[30:27.01]Now's the time to do it Now's the time to do it
[31:00.44]Don't lose faith just yet.
[31:06.21]I covered it with my face.
[31:10.59]Yeah, I, like, I'm trying just to press the button, but moving the fuck around in this game sucks asshole.
[31:29.32]No, no, no, no.
[31:57.44]This game's not tuned correctly to do this super hard.
[32:00.74]The game's not tuned correctly.
[32:03.01]With a 2D game, you gotta play with 2D characters.
[32:04.77]The first full second is you trying to figure out what fucking character you are, and what direction you need to move, and can that character even do the minigame?
[32:12.73]It's not tuned for this.
[32:13.83]There's a fucking extra mode they put on.
[32:16.17]It was never tuned for it.
[32:17.29]Memorize.
[32:25.34]Match it.
[32:32.55]This is the one.
[32:42.96]Hey, I'm just telling you right now, bet all your money on this next run.
[32:49.76]Bet it all.
[32:50.50]I'm telling you, I'm gonna get it.
[32:52.12]Bet every cent you have.
[32:53.18]It's so annoying.
[33:06.97]I think some motherfuckers just go so much faster than others.
[33:09.54]Like, do people have different fucking speeds?
[33:12.44]Like, it's... For a game that takes one... And that's cheating, apparently.
[33:21.84]Some people look faster than others?
[33:23.50]This game's a six.
[33:31.98]Out of ten.
[33:36.11]Let's see if it can build back and come back to like a 7.9.
[33:37.97]Let's see if they can build it back to a 7.9 for me.
[33:41.17]Let's find out.
[33:50.68]He said go all in.
[34:05.10]what's the point of having half of these characters in the game if only three of them are any good let's go alright this is the team this is gonna be this this is the team this is the team this is the run this is the team bet everything I I would don't listen
[34:44.45]This is the one.
[34:47.45]Bet everything on this one.
[34:48.25]Alright, this is the one.
[34:54.63]Definitely bet on this one.
[34:58.07]This is the one.
[34:58.95]I'm not...
[35:19.22]Get it all.
[35:20.83]All of it.
[35:21.43]Your whole bank account on this.
[35:24.81]How the fuck are you supposed to do that with some character?
[36:39.73]But when it's in the ocean
[37:05.73]That defogged his face!
[37:40.06]They're moving!
[38:11.89]I just read the characters, fucking, that character, that character's like, why am I supposed to, what?
[38:18.50]That character, that character says, why am I supposed to?
[38:44.48]Okay, here's my complaint.
[38:47.84]Some characters change the actual level.
[38:52.64]And in WarioWare, memorizing a level is incredibly important.
[38:57.06]And if you have a different character and that motherfucker changes the whole level... Oh, I don't think so.
[39:04.39]Oh my god, 49!
[39:08.47]My god, but he was oh my goodness.
[39:12.94]You've got to be kidding me.
[39:19.96]Oh My god, it was 49 you've got to be kidding me the one that was like, oh you're gonna shoot Hold on to the ring as it changes the fucking whole level.
[39:35.57]Oh I'm so disappointed
[39:39.36]Okay.
[39:41.10]Got there once, I can get there again.
[39:42.38]I'm going for it.
[39:49.49]No.
[39:49.71]Fuck the haters.
[39:51.23]I'm going in with 18 volt.
[39:54.85]There are three.
[40:10.65]Relax.
[40:11.99]Everybody relax.
[40:12.89]Put every cent you own on this guy.
[40:44.83]WHY WOULDN'T HE MOVE HIS ARMS?!
[40:46.01]I...
[41:13.54]49!
[41:13.78]It's still in my brain.
[41:16.15]Rent free?
[41:44.11]Worst fucking character to do this with, really.
[41:47.99]Fire, you motherfucker!
[42:09.06]What are you doing?
[42:10.24]What?
[42:10.52]What?
[42:11.40]What the hell?
[42:13.54]okay okay what the you gotta be kidding me what like I'm pressing a and she's not firing these things have battery I've charged them overnight okay we're doing a face team don't care let's begin
[42:42.49]These goddamn Switch controllers.
[42:43.89]Alright, it's the controllers.
[42:52.08]Yeah, it is the controllers.
[42:56.36]It's the Wii...
[43:13.04]Alright, focusing every cent you own on this.
[43:18.33]Every cent you have for channel funds, all of them.
[43:21.79]Oh, I just burped!
[43:24.21]People are gonna get just like, puke.
[43:55.68]Yeah, that's unfair.
[43:56.54]Okay, what's the RNG?
[43:57.62]What's the... What's the fucking RNG on that one?
[44:00.04]What's the RNG on that one?
[44:00.86]You put snake on top of the... You put snake... Whatever.
[44:12.04]No, you fucking dumb donkey.
[44:28.07]I'm just trying to move my character across the goddamn screen, dude.
[44:32.43]I'm just trying to move the guy.
[44:34.27]2D WarioWare.
[44:35.19]Move guy.
[44:35.61]Oops.
[44:35.75]Spell's broken.
[44:36.15]Not bad.
[44:36.61]This more can't hurt.
[44:37.83]This is it.
[44:38.65]Get him.
[44:38.89]Alright.
[44:39.43]It's me.
[44:54.71]Need.
[45:17.36]You just get stuck in this shit, like...
[45:36.51]What the fuck?
[45:40.77]Three, one... I gotta start over, it's not even worth it.
[45:46.46]I got two more lives, it's not gonna happen.
[45:51.02]I'm not gonna do it.
[45:54.38]Dude, I can't even fucking move.
[45:56.42]I can't even... Like, some of these minigames, you get stuck on a fucking pixel, and then it's over, you just lose.
[46:16.98]Remember when you just had to go like this?
[46:20.14]Or like this?
[46:20.70]Or like this?
[46:22.46]Or like that?
[46:32.78]Fun.
[46:52.25]I know.
[46:52.63]I can't believe I got to 49.
[46:53.81]I'm so mad.
[46:57.78]There was like a Satan sitting on my shoulder whispering in my ear just going 49, 49.
[47:02.90]You fucked it up, didn't you?
[47:05.18]49.
[47:05.22]You could have just moved on.
[47:10.24]Why can't I fucking touch?
[47:11.66]What?
[47:14.80]Why wouldn't it flip up?
[47:16.62]It flipped the other one up, but it wouldn't flip the middle one up?
[47:20.26]I literally touched it with my head.
[47:45.24]This is definitely not the one I'm not going to be able to do it.
[47:57.68]I can't do it.
[48:00.48]I can't.
[48:01.20]I can't do it.
[48:02.32]I can't do it, guys.
[48:03.58]I can't do it.
[48:15.42]Do not bet on this one.
[48:16.40]I'm going to lose this one for sure.
[48:17.51]Guaranteed.
[48:17.93]And there's no way I do it.
[48:45.83]No way.
[48:46.17]Guaranteed to lose.
[48:47.27]Dude!
[48:50.09]Dude, yes, it's so fucking annoying.
[48:51.40]Like, you try to get over there, and you get, like, moved.
[48:54.04]Ugh.
[49:19.36]Wrong way!
[49:30.57]I can't even move the other way!
[49:40.07]Touch it, you...
[50:00.10]Oh my god, it's like the characters are made out of fucking grease.
[50:03.83]They're gonna patch this game in like a fucking two or three weeks.
[50:19.49]They're gonna realize this is- humans couldn't do this past level 50.
[50:25.06]Is it gonna go- oh shit, we need to add like an extra half second for you to decide what way you have to run first.
[50:30.75]I wasn't even paying attention.
[50:34.19]It's gonna get patched.
[50:39.60]They're gonna patch this.
[50:41.02]They're gonna realize, like, oh, why is Super Hard Mode in this game?
[50:43.78]It's not even fucking tuned correctly.
[50:45.42]It's gonna be like, oh, we saw the streamer, this guy, Jerma985, twitch.tv/Jerma985.
[50:52.08]We've realized our absolute faults as developers.
[50:59.10]Once he got to 47, 49, he's like one of the greatest gamers on the platform.
[51:03.64]It's just not possible for people to do it.
[51:10.07]They'll probably patch the game and they'll realize it was incorrect.
[52:16.23]THIS- THAT ONE'S SO IMPOSSIBLE!
[52:20.27]You can't do that one!
[52:21.51]Go, Wario!
[52:24.77]Hmm, nice!
[52:25.46]Come on!
[52:26.10]Give me time!
[52:30.46]Here we go!
[52:31.30]Uh-huh!
[52:33.04]Must!
[52:34.72]Need!
[52:35.20]Rattle!
[52:35.70]High five!
[52:38.63]Good!
[52:38.85]Mm-hmm!
[52:39.21]Groovin'!
[52:39.89]Attract!
[52:44.06]Just fucking why?
[52:50.08]This game's not built to be able to play it this fast.
[52:56.40]Oh my god!
[53:12.23]It's not built to be able to go this fast!
[53:17.07]Some of these fucking characters require a full second to even do anything!
[53:19.57]Serve!
[53:22.79]Not bad!
[53:25.82]Why not?
[53:27.94]Sort!
[53:34.14]Throw in!
[53:35.02]Come on!
[53:36.38]Steer clear!
[53:47.91]Wow, Jeremy, you kind of suck, LOL.
[53:52.31]Shut up.
[53:53.45]They're baiting me.
[53:54.57]Don't let them bait you.
[53:57.57]But, like, do you see?
[53:58.91]Do you understand my problem?
[54:01.35]Like, this shit... Yes!
[54:05.01]I win!
[54:05.37]Okay, okay.
[54:09.03]Good luck!
[54:10.65]Attacked!
[54:13.10]No way!
[54:13.98]Big shelter!
[54:57.45]You're not supposed to play this mode.
[55:01.59]The whole game was like tuned accordingly.
[55:03.87]This one is definitely not.
[55:06.77]Without fucking question.
[55:17.17]I can't believe I got 40 fucking dimes.
[55:50.00]new technique new technique coming
[56:34.66]Watch out!
[56:35.04]Reunite!
[57:17.39]Make a match.
[57:19.91]Why not?
[57:20.79]Match.
[57:25.05]Oh, fuck, it's stupid.
[57:26.62]More app.
[57:27.90]Yep.
[57:29.26]My specialty.
[57:30.64]OK, OK.
[57:31.36]Yeah.
[57:31.84]Come on, guy.
[57:32.76]My specialty.
[57:33.76]Must.
[57:34.30]Get moving.
[58:03.27]Jesus Christ, man.
[58:04.75]Some of the characters are just not designed to play certain mini-games in one full second.
[58:11.73]A bunch of these characters are just not designed to do half of these mini-games in the time of Super Hard Gives You.
[58:18.10]You get my drift?
[58:19.14]Memorize.
[58:26.97]Match it.
[58:37.42]Believer's crying.
[58:41.56]Like, holy fucking moly, man.
[58:43.50]Like, when you... That was going so well.
[58:50.42]You have to have five people.
[58:51.80]Like, why can't I just play it with one person?
[58:54.02]Okay, okay.
[59:06.48]Like, every other character on this list that's not a shooter flyer requires a full second of your brain to even understand which way you have to go to do their weird technique to complete the flippin' minigame.
[59:27.67]I almost said the F-word.
[59:28.65]And that never happens on this channel.
[59:39.80]I almost said it.
[59:40.40]I'm really sorry.
[59:41.76]That came really close.
[59:42.68]Get it.
[60:28.03]But do you understand that that level in particular, it takes a full second for all the characters to even move, the water you go slower!
[60:35.83]And you have to get like, out of the fuck, you have to like, go around, it's by the time you know what you're doing, it's fucking over!
[60:41.17]Alright!
[60:45.20]Let's-a go!
[60:45.62]If I must.
[60:45.88]Come here.
[61:00.46]The lines of the characters suck.
[61:03.00]Like, why would I put 9-Volt in here?
[61:05.38]Like, let's put 9-Volt in here.
[61:06.74]Watch.
[61:07.68]Why would I ever use this shitty character?
[61:09.34]There's no reason to.
[61:10.08]You don't get extra gosh darn points for playing as 9-Volt?
[61:14.98]What?
[61:17.20]What?
[61:30.21]Clear screen.
[62:01.28]Okay, everyone.
[62:09.03]Do you get it?
[62:09.71]Do you understand why some of these characters should never be played with?
[62:16.55]Because it changes the whole minigame.
[62:18.33]It changes the entire minigame.
[62:20.84]That's the thing about WarioWare.
[62:21.82]It's gotta be the same so you can fucking know what the fuck you gotta do when you get it in your brain.
[62:25.24]Like, why would you change the whole minigame?
[62:26.58]Okay.
[62:35.66]That's the point?!
[62:36.36]I had forty fuckin' nine!
[63:03.20]Can he get past 35?
[63:03.82]Whoa, we're going down?
[63:06.42]You guys lost even more confidence?
[63:10.39]Wait, hold on.
[63:11.81]This one doesn't count.
[63:13.59]I'm noticing that we're going down to 35.
[63:14.83]You guys have lost all confidence.
[63:16.41]This is still going.
[63:17.83]You don't have to delete this one.
[63:18.95]We're just still going.
[63:20.33]I had to reset that because I can't believe that I'm being taken down.
[63:30.74]That way, I'm just going to stop that one.
[63:33.99]Now I know what I have to go for.
[63:35.81]It's so finicky, it really is.
[64:14.38]Which is greater!
[64:17.96]Knock down!
[64:19.16]Build it!
[64:20.86]Yes!
[64:21.82]Easy peasy!
[64:23.12]Unlock!
[64:23.60]Take a seat!
[64:24.73]Take shelter!
[64:51.05]Yo!
[65:26.24]Get out of this fucking train, Wario!
[65:50.65]God, it's like, some of those are just so, like, impossible to do in that small amount of time!
[66:24.80]It's just needing to move these motherfuckers around like that and like in awkward directions and fuck
[66:53.61]Make it 40?
[66:54.33]Hold on.
[67:03.35]Like, having to, like, analog around and then touch this little area.
[67:06.59]It's just like, fuck, man.
[67:08.15]Like, this shit.
[67:09.47]It's so, like, finicky if you touch it.
[67:10.99]It's like, wait!
[67:12.45]Unplug.
[67:25.73]Yes!
[68:03.10]That one's... Seriously, you can't fucking do that shit!
[68:23.73]That's the stupidest one!
[68:31.85]It takes way longer to even get over there!
[68:33.77]That one's so dumb!
[69:05.14]Push it out.
[69:09.18]Catch three.
[69:11.83]Line up.
[69:12.33]Renew.
[69:13.05]I won.
[69:16.39]I got it.
[69:16.99]Find a figure.
[69:21.30]Watch out.
[69:40.52]One, one, one, one, one!
[69:42.20]What the fuck?
[69:45.32]Why?
[69:47.28]Why would they... Dude, some of these are seriously stupid.
[70:00.83]Like, some of these are stupid.
[70:13.56]Some of these are guaranteed losses.
[70:18.23]I have to get it!
[70:51.85]Okay.
[71:36.20]Do you understand how some of these are stupid and they don't make any fucking sense?
[72:10.60]Some of them are so finicky!
[72:51.57]Drat!
[73:37.82]What the fuck are you talking about?
[73:40.68]Defog?
[73:44.44]Defog?
[73:45.34]What do you mean?
[73:46.46]Like, I just... What?
[73:51.72]I swear to God, some of these minigames are just dog shit.
[73:57.54]It's just glasses?
[73:58.55]I... Morty!
[74:01.15]Dislodge.
[74:11.07]Fuck that, man!
[74:16.05]And how would you expect me- I'm fine, I did it.
[74:54.80]I don't even understand what some of these want you to even do.
[74:58.90]Like, some of these are so strange.
[75:01.00]It's like, what are you talking about?
[75:03.12]Shimmy, what the fuck are you talking about?
[75:05.42]You have a tenth of a second to figure out what the fuck to do.
[75:07.81]Shimmy, what's that mean?
[75:09.67]It doesn't mean punch person inside.
[75:16.06]I'm throwing this one in the trash.
[75:17.20]It's over.
[75:19.97]When you have that few time to understand what's even going on, it can't be that, like, what?
[75:25.45]And the character... Oh, I am fucking furious right now.
[75:34.40]Okay, okay.
[75:37.14]Sealed.
[75:50.94]Like some characters just they their movement doesn't even make any sense for the game at hand Some of them like move faster some of them are slow
[76:24.19]This is the one.
[76:25.33]Walk it in.
[76:25.81]That one needs to be patched.
[76:30.28]That one needs to be patched.
[76:32.58]That one needs to be patched.
[76:34.80]That one needs to be patched.
[76:36.64]That one needs to be...
[76:53.06]Poor Coffinter blames his tools.
[77:13.78]Yeah.
[77:14.46]A poor carpenter blames the tools if you give me, like, a rubber children's mallet toy to build a fuckin' house with!
[77:20.91]My voice, it's changed!
[77:21.83]Mmm!
[77:24.03]Cover!
[77:25.37]Yes!
[77:27.05]Easy peasy!
[77:28.87]Come on!
[77:32.87]Really?
[77:34.75]Ooh, that's nice!
[78:09.12]Hatch that one too.
[78:10.74]Hatch that shit too.
[78:11.54]That one doesn't make no sense to me either.
[78:33.97]Still in it.
[78:34.33]Still in it.
[78:34.83]Put your fucking head over there!
[79:10.71]Those ones are so stupid, they're the worst.
[79:38.02]No!
[79:39.02]I was trying to shoot the guy that...
[80:07.03]I was trying to shh... Black.
[80:15.72]Hey, what?
[80:17.60]Get over there, you fucking...
[80:38.04]This more can't hurt.
[80:43.41]Memorize.
[80:44.73]Match it.
[80:46.71]Why not?
[80:47.95]Roll.
[80:49.41]It is on.
[80:50.29]Escape.
[81:09.55]Why couldn't I fucking break it?
[81:16.33]Why couldn't I break it?
[81:20.18]You can't change the rules WarioWare.
[81:23.10]You can't just change the rules like that.
[81:25.16]A head bump breaks the fucking thing.
[81:33.22]Don't change the rules on me.
[81:50.59]If only I didn't shoot, like, because the guy, oh, he only shoots this way.
[81:53.90]Oh, yeah, and I draw, whoops, I didn't, oh.
[82:00.26]47, again.
[82:00.72]Oh, I keep coming so goddamn close.
[82:20.19]Come on.
[82:22.69]Easy.
[82:23.57]I love getting stuck on shit.
[82:29.08]Great 2D character game in a WarioWare.
[82:37.38]Fucking dumbass game.
[82:41.36]I swear to fucking god.
[82:44.12]Some of these are just impossible and I guess you have to live with that.
[82:57.33]this is unbelievable because you're gonna end up getting eventually you're gonna end up getting one of the mini games that's just like not possible with the character you're playing in the super hard mode you're eventually gonna get hit with a shitty scenario where you can't even beat it with the guy
[83:21.18]I don't want to try the different characters because
[83:47.98]You like this game?
[83:48.67]No.
[83:49.59]No, I hate it, actually.
[83:50.39]I think this is the worst one.
[83:53.09]This is the worst game I've played in the last ten years.
[83:55.75]At least.
[83:58.57]What a- What a- What a fucking flop.
[84:17.01]Remember guys, just call something a flop if you don't like it.
[84:21.39]No, I do love this game.
[84:22.63]I just think that it's... I think it's fairly untuned for this particular game mode I'm trying to win.
[84:28.76]Oh, what a fucking flop.
[84:43.99]This game's a fucking flop, I'm telling you.
[84:45.57]It's gonna sell fucking less than 10,000 copies.
[84:46.69]Alright, here we go.
[85:11.76]Okay, okay.
[85:12.40]Protect.
[85:13.76]Nailed it.
[85:14.56]Fly time.
[85:15.52]Steal back.
[85:16.62]My specialty.
[85:18.04]Transport.
[85:54.60]What the fuck?
[85:55.86]You can't change the fucking rules.
[85:58.62]You can't change the rules.
[86:01.39]Like, I'm touching the... What the fuck?
[86:05.65]You can't change the fucking rules.
[86:08.41]If I touch it...
[86:25.41]My specialty must... Alright!

[88:48.94]LET'S GO!
[89:24.23]Ah!
[90:45.52]alright alright okay okay got 73. yes high score alright the game could jump back up to an 8.2
[90:59.24]It was a six point, it was a six point two.
[91:01.61]And then it became an eight point two again.
[91:02.95]Alright, good.
[91:04.35]Alright.
[91:33.50]That's it, I promise.
[91:40.82]What a fucking flop.
[91:44.90]What a fucking flop.
[91:45.90]Hey, beep man, thanks for the damn community sub.
[92:10.11]I can literally only bet 10 channel points.
[92:12.89]Oh, I don't know what you did, man.
[92:17.36]That's kind of scary.
[92:18.44]This is impossible.
[92:39.78]Yeah, right!
[92:40.70]No fucking way!
[92:41.96]Throw that girl in the trash!
[92:47.90]Yes!
[92:51.76]A triumph!
[93:01.18]And great!
[93:05.30]Hey!
[93:06.84]Hey!
[93:07.12]Hey!
[93:12.81]It's okay.
[93:13.19]I got 73 points and I have nothing to prove anymore.
[93:15.45]I win.
[93:15.91]That was a wicked banksa moment.
[93:25.94]Sit in the chair!
[93:26.76]What are you, dumb?
[93:30.13]Couldn't get 100?
[93:30.49]It's alright.
[93:31.05]Alright.
[93:32.01]Let's- I wanna- I wanna try- What do you mean first place?
[93:36.49]Oh.
[93:38.21]I want to try, uh, this one.
[93:40.53]This is my voice.
[93:42.99]Holy shit.
[93:50.06]I'm so glad I had Cricket.
[93:51.34]Cricket's the only reason why I'm still here.
[93:59.80]Check the leaderboard?
[94:00.50]Oh, that's probably a daily game, you're right.
[94:02.20]This game's really good.
[94:03.91]This is a fun game.
[94:09.38]What?
[94:11.54]I don't... Changing the rules again.
[94:17.68]Game over?
[94:21.31]I'm not going to get 100.
[94:21.99]No fucking way.
[94:22.97]I'm not putting that on me.
[94:24.77]The title of this stream is 50.
[94:28.13]I'm not doing 100.
[94:28.59]Okay.
[94:39.13]These are very hard.
[94:45.65]Although I have time, though.
[94:49.85]Oh, I feel like I'm playing a comp- I feel like I'm in slow motion.
[94:52.44]I don't- I don't understand.
[95:00.36]Yeah, now I do.
[95:04.40]I feel like I'm talking in slow motion too as I was going too fast before.
[95:11.00]See what I mean?
[95:12.54]Everything is too slow.
[95:14.28]Oh, that's weird.
[95:22.27]I've been on x10 speed for the last hour and a half.
[95:34.96]Adjust.
[95:37.78]Holy shit, these are hard.
[95:38.56]Alright, I'm going to try to get 20 on this one.
[95:42.10]20, I'll be happy.
[95:43.56]Protect.
[95:47.51]Then I'm going to spend a bunch of my money and leave.
[95:52.33]Demolish.
[95:58.27]Yes.
[96:01.08]Rinse.
[96:05.82]I'll be happy with 20.
[96:06.32]Fucking flop.
[96:07.70]Holy shit.
[96:10.38]Oh!
[96:38.31]Running!
[96:39.37]Got it!
[96:41.33]That was tough!
[97:06.00]I, this is the, I don't know, this is why I don't like the game!
[97:10.46]I don't like when they make you move and you have to, mmm.
[97:14.13]Like, you have to move in every one of these minigames and it's just like, fuck, I moved a little bit and I did the, I ended it.
[97:20.76]Last round.
[97:26.80]Like, I start every one of these ready to go.
[97:33.43]Grab it!
[97:36.19]Now we're doing this one ASMR.
[97:49.48]Okay.
[97:54.28]Today I'm replaying WarioWare for the Nintendo Switch.
[97:58.81]And I'm going to be relax you.
[98:00.19]I'm going to be really relaxing for you.
[98:02.85]Okay, so what we're going to do here is I'm going to try to get these things.
[98:06.91]And exactly what we're going to do here is we're going to get this thing here.
[98:09.11]Peel this banana peel.
[98:09.59]It's impossible.
[98:12.71]Literally not completable.
[98:14.50]It's literally not completable.
[98:15.90]I was going to scream, but I don't want to do that.
[98:18.30]Alright, one more try.
[98:22.14]Light up.
[98:31.69]What kind of ASMR do you listen to?
[98:33.49]I don't.
[98:34.21]Anyway, that looks good right now.
[98:43.19]Is that avocado toast with an egg on it?
[98:44.85]Oh, scrumptious.
[98:47.27]That sounds good to me.
[98:50.87]Scrum-tiddly-umptious.
[99:04.37]What?
[99:05.57]That's what you guys are upset about now?
[99:07.25]Is me saying that avocado toast looks scrumdiddlyumptious?
[99:13.01]That's... That's what you want to say is the thing you don't like?
[99:19.15]It was awful.
[99:20.10]I... No, it wasn't.
[99:22.20]Holy shit.
[99:24.16]I think it's pink.
[99:25.34]Okay, it's pink.
[99:35.51]There's only Ned Flanders?
[99:40.99]How am I Ned Flanders?
[100:04.18]Oh, they move across the screen.
[100:06.35]Of course they do.
[100:07.23]One more.
[100:07.65]Alright, I'm done.
[100:10.61]One more.
[100:11.73]One more and then I'm going to feed my friends.
[100:25.83]I would not be betting on this.
[100:26.83]I have not had any experience in half these minigames.
[100:35.51]Why would you be betting on this?
[100:41.57]What?
[100:41.89]I don't get it.
[100:45.29]Last one.
[100:50.84]Trap two.
[100:51.38]Do I have to trap two individual or trap them both at the same time?
[100:56.18]Gotta be more clear about that, please.
[101:05.20]Stop betting!
[101:05.76]What's wrong with you guys?
[101:11.00]Oh, sticky!
[101:11.92]Holy... fuck-a-moly, that was... hard.
[101:19.00]One more.
[101:35.45]This is actually the last one.
[101:36.81]I swear to God.
[101:39.73]I'm getting 20 on this one.
[101:40.83]I would bet on this one if I were you.
[101:42.10]I'm telling you, I would do it.
[101:46.10]If I were in the chat right now, I would bet that I was going to get 20.
[101:48.20]I'm just saying.
[101:49.40]Ah!
[102:07.30]I look like my face at the end.
[102:10.22]Steer clear!
[102:12.42]It is on!
[102:15.88]Peel!
[102:16.70]Focus, focus!
[102:17.53]Point!
[102:18.35]Drink up!
[102:39.41]Wouldn't that be the big one and the small one?
[102:56.77]I'll do this one with no glitch.
[103:01.41]I'm gonna be better.
[103:09.59]Finish.
[103:13.24]Oh, one kernel.
[103:19.96]Oh my god.
[103:22.57]Oh yeah, back for more.
[103:26.85]Let's begin.
[103:29.55]Empty.
[103:47.16]Seek Shelter!
[103:49.16]It's me!
[103:50.50]Watch out!
[103:53.44]I win!
[103:53.84]If I must... Rinse!
[104:44.35]Yo.
[104:45.11]Yo.
[104:45.81]Like, yo.
[104:46.81]I don't... Like... Some of these.
[104:51.32]Throw them in the trash.
[104:53.14]Remove them.
[104:53.84]Like, just get rid of them.
[104:55.18]Throw them away.
[104:56.84]Last one.
[105:00.97]Like, some of those are stupid.
[105:02.12]Just throw them away.
[105:02.62]They don't even need to be in the game.
[105:03.53]They're dumb.
[105:21.06]I'm trying to make it to 20.
[105:23.86]I don't have to make it to 20.
[105:25.48]I don't care.
[105:26.16]I really don't even care.
[105:29.14]I don't care.
[105:29.84]I don't even care.
[105:33.15]Like, oh my god.
[105:35.03]Oh my god.
[105:35.77]These people think I care.
[105:36.67]You think I care?
[105:37.49]I was trying to... Oh, I can jump up there.
[105:41.89]Okay.
[105:49.81]These people, like, in the chat, like, I care.
[105:51.61]Like, I don't even fucking care.
[105:53.09]Like, holy shit, dude.
[105:55.86]Like, I don't give a shit.
[105:57.38]I don't care.
[106:06.42]Oh, we'll be having pasta today.
[106:24.43]End the stream if you don't care.
[106:25.47]That's the thing.
[106:26.65]That's what you don't get.
[106:27.83]I don't care enough about the stream, and I don't care about not streaming for me to care.
[106:33.87]Are you serious?
[106:36.07]I don't care about not streaming, and I don't care about streaming either.
[106:38.09]So what?
[106:38.40]The ball's in your court.
[106:44.70]It's a big bunny.
[106:50.45]Pink did not win.
[106:51.43]Wait.
[106:52.98]Oh, I think I got baited here.
[106:55.66]Yeah.
[106:56.84]No.
[106:58.52]Perfect character for this.
[107:04.48]One, two, three, four, five.
[107:11.97]Oh, he didn't even care.
[107:12.65]I don't even care.
[107:14.75]Take a peek.
[107:18.33]What's not there?
[107:20.40]I don't even care.
[107:24.56]Oh, wait, he had a...
[107:56.71]I'm so addicted.
[107:57.51]I can't stop.
[107:58.25]I know.
[107:58.87]I'm having fun.
[107:59.53]How am I supposed to tell the difference?
[108:10.63]I talked a lot of shit today, but I'm not even serious.
[108:13.35]I don't even care.
[108:17.64]Seek shelter.
[108:30.92]Hold on, I can do it better than this.
[108:31.84]Take off!
[108:35.04]Keep it up!
[108:37.96]Smooch!
[109:03.27]Shut up.
[109:07.49]I could have gone for so much longer.
[109:08.53]I think people really actually hated that.
[109:14.29]I could have gone on for like another 30 to 40 full seconds.
[109:19.58]I started seeing way more stop than way more cool, dude.
[109:34.99]Alright, let's go feed our friends.
[109:46.47]So that was WarioWare.
[109:47.25]That was really fun.
[109:48.27]Ooh.
[109:50.33]Legendary.
[110:06.45]Come on, I only got one legendary the whole time?
[110:08.41]That's kinda horseshit.
[110:17.01]Come on!
[110:21.45]Legendary!
[110:35.95]Alright, Wario.
[110:36.97]Let's give you a present.
[110:39.67]I'm gonna assume that Wario probably likes the thing with the Wario truck.
[110:44.02]Right?
[110:45.44]He didn't like it.
[110:53.44]Why wouldn't you like the truck with your face on it?
[111:05.96]I know he likes meat.
[111:13.67]And you have mission points, too.
[111:14.79]Oh, shit.
[111:15.11]That's right.
[111:15.45]Alright.
[111:18.25]Let's go to... Orbea Lion.
[111:21.37]What do you got?
[111:29.30]What is Orbea... The bowling pin, right?
[111:32.34]Yeah.
[111:42.24]I don't think Wario is capable of driving?
[111:46.88]Okay, who wants the truck?
[111:57.51]What about Mike?
[112:08.92]Or for the guitar, right?
[112:11.80]His favorite thing.
[112:13.40]That's a lot of points.
[112:17.69]I got a mission for that.
[112:23.57]Music related.
[112:24.73]Performance related.
[112:25.63]Music related.
[112:26.27]I don't think anything else here.
[112:39.08]Uh, we have a lot of sports stuff.
[112:44.24]Uh, baseball.
[112:48.85]Take the baby off?
[112:49.53]I will, I'll take it off.
[112:58.06]You get mission rewards at level 15 for everybody?
[113:00.16]Oh shit, that's good to know.
[113:11.19]Uh, any more sports?
[113:16.98]I don't think so.
[113:20.12]Boxing though?
[113:24.06]Alright, what about you?

[114:45.75]It's good.
[114:47.61]What did I say?
[114:48.01]It's the worst game to come out in the last 10 years?

[119:09.50]He loves bikes.
[119:12.18]Definitely the high-tech shoes, that's for sure.
[119:20.77]Yeah.
[119:21.59]Alright, come on.
[119:22.91]I'm just going to give him the toilet.
[119:25.33]He loves it.

[119:29.89]He's 15.
[119:30.05]Okay.
[119:35.50]So who else likes the toilet that's not 15?

[120:27.28]Okay, so these remaining ones... What about cricket?
[120:33.57]How about, uh, Deer Scare?
[120:36.95]This is soothing.
[120:39.90]Um, he didn't hate it, but he didn't love it.
[120:46.62]Dumbbells?
[120:49.06]For, like, training?
[121:03.38]You're obsessed?
[121:04.46]I mean, I'm just having fun, man.

[121:14.35]What about the camera?
[121:19.11]Oh, he doesn't like cameras at all.

[125:25.31]I'm ready to level up again.
[125:26.45]And now I'm going to level up other people to 15 and the cycle continues for at least another 10 minutes.
[125:34.04]Alright, who wants the golden crown?
[125:40.66]Okay, you need to get to 15.
[125:43.36]Expensive vase?
[125:49.26]Wario?
[125:49.77]A real head turner.
[125:51.35]Great for folks with a take charge attitude.
[125:58.15]Well, I know you like... No, you don't like this.
[125:59.97]What do you like?
[126:04.09]You like dumbbells.
[126:04.95]It's gonna be Wario.
[126:20.65]Ashley?
[126:21.87]Wario's already 15, though.
[126:25.61]In the soccer ball?
[126:30.56]Yeah, he likes it.

[127:40.30]Okay.
[127:45.07]Give him a vase?
[127:47.03]I'll try the vase.
[127:51.13]Mm-mm.
[127:52.85]Mm-mm.
[127:54.35]That was incorrect.
[127:57.27]Worth a shot, though.
[127:58.01]Alright, what about the electric guitar?
[128:03.04]That's alright, we got our 2,000.
[128:12.88]Alright, what about Jimmy?

[129:42.76]I'm going, I'm going Vaze.
[129:49.24]No, it's not worth it.
[129:50.42]It's not worth it.

[131:18.45]Do you like... vases?
[131:39.78]Do you like helicopters?
[131:43.22]Maybe because helicopters fly?
[131:47.48]Alright, level 9.
[131:51.95]And why don't you take the crane?
[131:54.81]Why do you like construction material?
[131:56.27]Alright.

[136:57.25]Um, I didn't even... I don't think I even really played it.
[137:09.32]What's the point of raising the levels?
[137:10.80]Um, to unlock new costumes for them and art.
[137:14.52]It's just kind of for fun.
[137:33.88]Gives you points in the Wario Cup mode.
[137:37.36]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[137:43.64]Change Mike.
[137:44.44]Don't worry, I'll give everybody their final costumes.

[140:05.52]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[140:10.10]Come on, man, I'm just winding down.
[140:11.36]I expelled all my energy.
[140:14.91]I'm screaming at the super hard bone.
[140:19.49]All my energy's gone, man.
[140:20.97]I beat no more heroes two hours ago.
[140:22.87]Cool, cool.
[140:24.59]It is cool, but I'm just tired.
[140:25.87]I'm relaxing, relaxing.
[140:28.58]I like how this went from a nuclear meltdown to this.
[140:31.16]That was not a nuclear meltdown.
[140:37.07]It was not.
[140:37.63]A nuclear meltdown.
[140:40.27]That is not even close.
[140:44.17]It was not even close to a nuclear meltdown.
[140:45.81]Give it a break.
[140:48.93]We did not go full nuclear.
[140:50.21]No, we did not.
[140:50.73]Ooh, I like that.
[140:57.06]Cool.
[141:03.32]You're screaming at the game.
[141:04.20]I wasn't screaming at the game.
[141:06.91]When did I scream at the game?
[141:10.53]Streamer dies playing WarioWare on a 10 day subathon challenge.
[141:16.08]I need to listen to this.
[141:19.90]I need to listen to this.
[141:37.29]Watch this.
[141:37.73]Okay.
[142:12.30]How long is this clip
[142:39.24]Nice.
[142:41.18]10 day subathon challenge.
[142:48.14]Why couldn't I fucking break it?
[142:56.31]Get over there you fucking... There is like a delay.
[143:01.65]It's like a tenth of a second.
[143:02.67]Get over there you fucking...
[143:04.93]It's because of the webcam lag.
[143:06.61]Okay.
[143:07.01]Well, whatever.
[143:07.51]You got any more clips I can watch?
[143:09.15]Sure.
[143:11.77]Watch this one.
[143:12.57]Okay.
[143:19.21]I don't think this was a nuclear meltdown.
[143:20.82]I really don't think so.
[143:22.52]I think you guys got it wrong.
[143:31.96]I don't consider this to be nuclear.
[143:36.19]This was, like, this was slight irritation.
[143:38.01]I don't know where the character's fucking... That character... That character's, like, why am I supposed to... Wait, what?
[143:51.34]That character... That character's, like, why am I supposed...
[143:54.70]That's someone that's clearly having a small amount of issue with the fact that the video game was fucking poorly... I didn't expect what was going to happen in front of me.
[144:04.83]That's a very normal reaction to have when something incredibly that you don't think is going to happen, happens.
[144:11.05]Three-year-old.
[144:11.49]That's not a three-year-old.
[144:14.08]The character's fucking... The character... The character's like... What?
[144:20.24]The character... The character's like...
[144:23.29]I'm getting stuck because I was at literally episode 49, trying to get to 50, and I couldn't do it.
[144:31.68]That's a horrible, horrible scenario.
[144:36.62]Here's another one.
[144:38.03]Alright, I'm going to only watch like two more of these before I get the point.
[144:41.27]I don't think it was nuclear.
[144:42.25]I don't think it was.
[144:42.95]It was like, it was sizzling.
[144:44.85]It was simmering.
[144:48.29]It was simmering a little.
[144:55.13]This shit was not nuclear.
[144:56.39]Alright, what's this one?
[145:12.00]That was fucking stupid!
[145:15.30]Don't you get that was like stu- WHAT ARE YOU MOTHERFUCKER?

[145:25.75]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[145:30.31]But watch what happens here.
[145:34.03]She doesn't grab it.
[145:35.69]She didn't grab it, and she's supposed to.
[145:37.45]When you touch it, it goes on your character.
[145:39.41]Fire, you motherfucker!
[145:44.22]What are you doing?
[145:45.06]What?
[145:45.36]What the hell?
[145:48.38]Okay, okay.
[145:49.48]What the fuck?
[145:53.16]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[145:58.90]The air blow.
[145:59.80]Alright, last one.
[146:00.78]I'm not watching it.
[146:02.06]Watch the second channel.
[146:04.43]You'll see this video soon.
[146:11.53]Oh, fucking nuclear.
[146:12.93]I don't know what this one is, but I'm going to watch it.
[146:21.21]This one's called the air blow psycho.
[146:23.68]Air snake.
[146:35.31]Okay, that one was like Like a fireball was just going towards me and that's the last thing I thought to do before I got liquefied
[147:00.85]Oh my goodness.
[147:05.63]Holy shit, dude.
[147:14.31]That's like I'm at Thanksgiving dinner.
[147:19.53]And like we're sitting there as the family.
[147:23.24]And like the son's not there or something.
[147:26.36]It's like, oh, everyone's at the table except for like Sean.
[147:32.25]And I'm mom.
[147:33.81]And I spent all day doing this.
[147:35.75]Setting up this table and everything.
[147:38.43]And then finally, like, we're in the middle of a conversation.
[147:41.39]And like, Sean comes down and fucking, just in his underwear.
[147:45.56]He goes into the fridge and starts drinking milk out of the carton.
[147:48.88]And I just took a bite at a turkey.
[147:51.68]That's the face that, that's like the, holy shit, Sean, what the fuck are you doing?
[147:56.94]Why are you not down here?
[147:59.05]Surrounded by family.

[148:05.19]And now it's embarrassing for me now because what am I going to do about this?
[148:08.61]Alright, I'm out of here.
[148:19.42]I'm done.
[148:20.24]Wait, let's look at the rest of these.
[148:24.06]That wasn't even nuclear.
[148:25.14]It was a little spicy, I will tell you.
[148:35.08]Hold on, wait wait wait, there's one more.
[148:36.34]Fighting Catdog.
[148:37.42]Fighting Catdog?
[148:42.33]Like Nickelodeon Catdog?
[148:49.06]I don't get it.
[148:49.54]Did I make a Nickelodeon reference?
[149:00.98]That one needs to be patched.
[149:03.30]That one needs to be patched.
[149:05.53]That one needs to be patched.
[149:07.39]That one needs to be patched.
[149:10.19]That one needs to be... Are you talking about the rabbit from CatDog?

[149:19.19]You think that you can come into my restaurant, CatDog?
[149:22.69]Oh, fuck, it is.
[149:23.63]It's the rabbit.
[149:24.21]It's like the bad guy.
[149:28.86]That one needs to be patched.
[149:31.16]That one needs to be patched.
[149:33.38]That one needs to be patched.
[149:35.24]That one needs to be patched.
[149:38.04]That one needs to be... It's the cat dog rabbit.
[149:50.91]Oh, how would you even... Oh my god.
[149:57.25]We can sit here and watch these.
[149:58.31]Okay, maybe it was a little nuclear.
[150:01.76]I don't think nuclear... Look.
[150:04.14]Alright.
[150:04.96]Well, look.
[150:05.66]Okay.
[150:10.18]I think I've gone all year without a nuclear stream.
[150:12.49]So, whatever.
[150:13.01]I don't even care.
[150:13.67]I don't even care.
[150:16.09]I don't even care.
[150:18.89]I don't even care, you know.
[150:19.65]I don't care.
[150:20.37]Alright, last one.
[150:23.43]What is this?
[150:25.03]Great 2D character game in a warrior world.
[150:37.39]some of these are just impossible and I guess you have to live with that what's wrong with that great 2D character game in a warrior it's not alright
[150:59.13]I've won, Batman.
[151:00.43]Alright, this is actually the last one.
[151:02.75]Look, yeah, I was pissed off.
[151:05.07]I'm playing super hard nuclear mode, alright?
[151:07.83]If I'm going to play nuclear mode and try to get past 50 rounds on nuclear, it's going to be a nuclear stream.
[151:13.11]Don't you get it?
[151:13.61]This is the last one.
[151:21.83]And then we're going to go through the last of the artwork here.
[151:24.43]And we're going to go from there.
[151:27.77]Awesome.
[151:32.11]What was this called?
[151:32.71]You've won Batman?
[151:33.77]Or I've won Batman?
[151:34.87]I don't know.
[151:35.67]One of those two.
[151:38.33]It's a laugh.
[151:53.67]Where's the one where I call it a flop?
[151:55.95]I'm gonna see that one.
[151:58.15]Somebody link me the one where I call the game a flop.
[152:00.15]That's the one I really want to see.
[152:11.04]Jerry Seinfeld?
[152:11.90]It's not that one.
[152:14.88]He hates it.
[152:16.26]Okay.
[152:16.54]I think that's probably it.
[152:24.18]I am going to judge if this is a nuclear stream or not by my interaction here.
[152:31.67]Because I can tell that I was actually a little irritated during this part.
[152:37.03]It's not that one.
[152:43.06]Okay, let's find out.
[152:52.81]You like this game?
[152:53.49]No.
[152:54.37]No, I hate it, actually.
[152:55.21]I think this is the worst one.
[152:57.91]This is the worst game I've played in the last 10 years.
[153:00.57]At least.
[153:03.39]What a, what a, what a fucking flop.
[153:05.83]Okay.
[153:06.29]Okay.
[153:10.36]You like this game?
[153:11.02]No.
[153:11.92]No, I hate it, actually.
[153:12.74]I think this is the worst one.
[153:15.44]This is the worst game I've played in the last ten years.
[153:18.11]At least.
[153:20.93]What a, what a, what a fucking flop.
[153:26.79]Alright, I concede.
[153:27.85]It was nuclear.
[153:28.83]I concede.
[153:30.40]I concede.
[153:32.34]Let's get back to this.
[153:38.30]Oh, look at this artwork.

[154:35.25]I'll go back.
[154:42.27]I like the gold.
[154:50.47]Oh, nine volt without hat?
[154:56.90]Was this worth the anger?
[154:59.34]Um, I mean, the anger was not opening galleries and looking at the artwork.
[155:04.02]It was to get past level 50 in super hard.
[155:07.40]That's the point of this whole second half of this stream.
[155:19.52]I like that.
[155:19.90]I like that.
[155:20.92]No.

[155:59.85]Um... I think I did.
[156:10.99]Did I do a Seinfeld impression?
[156:13.21]Trap 2.
[156:14.99]This is the third total this is why I don't like the game.

[163:40.50]Just wrapped their arms around both sides and just pushed in hard.
[163:47.16]Like I've been lifted out of the seat.
[163:48.52]Like they came and lifted me up out of the seat and pulled and pushed into my stomach.

[164:04.77]This really was a meltdown stream.
[164:06.80]Well, no, it wasn't a... Actually, here's my defense.
[164:10.48]The first four hours of this stream was me just playing No More Heroes and us hanging out.
[164:16.32]So, does it really qualify as a meltdown stream?
[164:19.77]Only the last hour or two was a true meltdown.
[164:26.33]Anyways.
[164:28.25]I'll see you guys next weekend.
[164:29.19]Take care of yourselves.
