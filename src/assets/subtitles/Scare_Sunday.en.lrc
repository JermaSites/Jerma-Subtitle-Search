[00:01.18]The next thing that we're going to play is... I would like to play... The Boba Tea Shop.
[00:24.36]It's a horror game.
[00:26.40]The Boba Tea Shop.
[00:35.76]Let me capture it.
[00:48.35]Got a good song.
[00:53.32]It's so loud.
[00:54.12]I'm so glad it was low.
[00:55.74]I'm so glad it was low and you didn't hear that.
[01:00.47]Also, because I'm going to be screaming, I need to turn off the noise removal.
[01:04.66]So you can hear everything now, every mouth sound, every movement of my teeth.
[01:09.73]You'll hear it all.
[01:19.60]Hey, I'm back.
[01:21.66]Alright, Boba Tea Shop.
[01:22.72]I'm not turning this up.
[01:23.80]Sorry, guys.
[01:24.44]Like, this shit was too... Fuck, that's way too loud.
[01:29.83]143 hertz.
[01:31.29]I don't... I got 120 hertz, bro.
[01:40.45]Brightness is fine.
[01:47.16]Let's go.
[01:47.96]This game will autosave at the end of every shift.
[01:49.57]Starting a new game will overwrite.
[01:51.23]Stop doing that.
[01:58.02]This game contains loud noises.
[02:00.30]Okay, so we know that.
[02:06.79]After saving up for five years, I finally have enough money to open my own boba tea shop.
[02:12.10]This is it.
[02:13.40]The moment where all those long corporate days finally pay off in the form of boba and dreams.
[02:18.24]Okay.
[02:20.69]But even with all this excitement, my nerves are on edge.
[02:22.87]I put everything into this place.
[02:23.85]I can't let it fail.
[02:33.12]It's going to be loud as fuck.
[02:34.31]I know it.
[02:37.27]Flip store assigned to open.
[02:46.79]Well, let me hold on.
[02:47.41]Let me make sure my shit looks good.
[02:54.02]Okay.
[02:55.20]Prepare for customers.
[02:55.90]Go to your counter and close the counter door.
[03:03.45]Okay.
[03:03.57]Talk to the customer to take orders.
[03:10.11]Destroying Dracula's Soul Stone is in the title still.
[03:13.26]It don't matter.
[03:17.33]It's about time a boba tea shop opened around here.
[03:19.30]I'll have a boba milk tea.
[03:30.75]Okay.
[03:30.89]Black tea, add milk and boba.
[03:36.65]Fill a cup with black tea.
[03:43.78]A cup with black tea.
[03:46.42]Where's the tea?
[03:48.32]I don't know where the T is.
[03:49.20]There's a bug crawling in my ear.
[03:57.95]Wait, place... That's a long ways away.
[04:00.94]Why is it up so high?
[04:05.16]It shouldn't be up that high.
[04:06.30]And then Bobo.
[04:18.32]Okay, and then we go... Here you go.
[04:26.45]Oh, I gotta seal the cup.
[04:35.40]Oh, cool.
[04:35.80]Yeah, it has a little thing on the sealer on the top.
[04:38.13]There you go.
[04:40.03]There you are.
[04:40.97]I'll have a bulb of milk tea.
[04:41.93]There it is.
[04:43.65]And... Thank you.
[04:47.67]Put the cash in the cash register.
[04:50.85]Alright.
[04:51.93]What's my boba order?
[04:53.71]Um, it's just boba with a little bit of water.
[04:57.42]Just a tiny bit of water so that you can move them around so they can stick together.
[05:00.62]And just eat it with a spoon.
[05:09.11]I've never had boba in my life.
[05:13.60]What's all this fuss about these drinks?
[05:16.62]It's milk tea with tapioca, also known as boba.
[05:20.77]Alright, then I'll take one boba milk tea for my son and one black tea for myself.
[05:25.47]Not sure I can trust those chewy things.
[05:31.24]You've got it.
[05:39.49]Here you go.
[05:40.95]Seal that one.
[05:41.75]And you said just black tea for you?
[05:43.17]Is that what you said?
[05:44.29]Just...
[05:50.53]I thought he was like climbing over the counter.
[05:52.29]I don't know.
[06:03.30]There you go.
[06:05.43]This better be good.
[06:14.68]That tea is not black.
[06:22.57]Yay, a boba tea shop.
[06:24.23]Big sis, can I get one fresh milk with boba, please?
[06:40.59]There you go.
[06:42.14]Should I turn the game down?
[06:43.56]She's gonna scream in my face or something, right?
[06:45.08]This is gonna be loud, isn't it?
[06:46.38]Turn your volume down.
[06:47.28]I'm not kidding.
[06:53.52]Big sis, you should add strawberry boba to the menu.
[06:55.85]It'd be a bestseller for sure.
[07:02.91]I'll do some research after closing.
[07:18.46]Okay.
[07:18.80]What did you even order?
[07:22.37]What did he order?
[07:40.02]Any drink will do.
[07:41.44]Oh, okay.
[07:49.80]Here, how about a glass of milk?
[07:58.97]Give him some... Hold on.
[08:00.87]Milk with a splash of tea?
[08:02.23]Here, I don't know.
[08:04.00]I'll take this.
[08:04.92]Drink this.
[08:07.08]Do a glass full of boba.
[08:08.82]Oh, actually, yeah, I'll do that.
[08:19.90]No, it's not a completed product.
[08:25.27]Oh, whatever.
[08:26.34]Here, just take this.
[08:29.92]Okay, here, ding.
[08:31.77]There's no boba in this drink.
[08:36.16]Hey, fucking idiot.
[08:37.04]You told me I don't care what the drink is.
[08:46.48]Hey, imagine saying, I don't care what the drink is, as long as, uh, it's like, okay, well, I just gave it to you.
[08:50.93]It was a drink, and you... What a moron.
[08:57.68]Oh, so you look really cute.
[08:58.42]Can I have your number?
[09:01.54]No, get the fuck out of here.
[09:03.99]Here's a little extra five.
[09:05.07]You tipped me anyways.
[09:11.20]Okay.
[09:11.74]That's all for today.
[09:12.56]I should clean the shop and prep for tomorrow.
[09:18.81]This is gonna be one of those games where, like, there's just somebody fucking staring at me, like, through the wall, like, through the glass and stuff.
[09:28.73]Yeah!
[09:33.78]I just spilled this all over me.
[09:35.18]Fuck.
[09:37.55]Oh, no, I didn't.
[09:38.01]No, I didn't.
[09:38.33]We're good.
[09:39.43]We're good.
[09:40.95]Just a little.
[09:48.04]We are perfectly fine.
[09:50.09]It was just a little bit.
[09:51.97]But this mouse pad's got to go.
[09:54.98]It was even after I got scared.
[09:56.48]It was like the scare came in that I was... Give me one second.
[10:00.60]Hold on.
[10:46.88]I'm back.
[10:51.27]I'm back and I got... I got beer everywhere.
[10:54.35]No, I didn't.
[11:03.58]Let me move this out of the way.
[11:06.99]Damn it.
[11:14.51]It's fine as long as you have some more.
[11:16.87]I got more.
[11:19.70]Oh, my mouse pad!
[11:21.26]I like this mouse pad!
[11:24.25]Look!
[11:32.02]It's got like sharks!
[11:34.89]And it's ruined!
[11:44.97]Alright, hold on.
[11:45.63]This is a little bit more elaborate than I thought it was going to be.
[11:47.64]One second.
[11:49.81]Hold on.
[11:50.31]I got to wipe this with something wet.
[12:27.75]This thing's been on screen the whole time.
[12:37.25]Okay, weirdly it didn't get anywhere else, which is actually great.
[12:40.78]It went all over my mousepad and the mousepad sucked up all of it.
[12:53.65]Okay, hold on.
[12:53.95]Yeah, that's crazy.
[13:00.08]Nothing down here, right?
[13:03.39]No, we're good.
[13:05.41]We're good to go.
[13:12.49]And thankfully, it was the most staining substance on Earth, cranberry juice.
[13:16.80]So that's great.
[13:30.18]You need a magic eraser.
[13:31.30]It actually didn't get on really anything besides the mouse pad and a little bit on the keyboard, but we're good.
[13:37.29]Alright.
[13:38.21]Sitting back down.
[13:44.26]Now it's blood in the shark infested water.
[13:46.62]That's kind of true.
[13:49.97]Alright.
[13:50.19]So what did I miss here?
[13:51.03]What happened?
[13:51.49]Did I get scared?
[13:55.99]so annoying that it happened after I got scared that would have been a clip right like have a liquid get all over me that I mean it would have been a funny clip that happened and we relaxed and then I took a sip you need one jump scare you need 156 minute break to clean it's been like two minutes give me a break it has been a hundred no you're talking about Dracula Dracula was a 156 minute intro to this stream okay
[14:28.49]It's cranberry juice, man.
[14:30.21]That shit is fucking like stains.
[14:33.85]Let me make sure the ratio is still fine.
[14:41.10]That's crisp.
[14:45.17]Uh-oh, that's crisp.
[14:47.69]Alright, what do you want?
[14:49.53]Sorry about to close and I had to rush in.
[14:56.82]It's fine.
[14:57.44]Come over to the counter.
[14:58.24]I'll take your order.
[14:59.20]Okay.
[15:10.12]I don't know.
[15:10.40]Just in case she fucking tries to attack me.
[15:12.74]What can I get you?
[15:13.58]I'll take one boba milk tea with extra boba.
[15:32.32]Here you go.
[15:36.35]Wait a minute.
[15:38.89]That's better.
[15:43.51]Thank you so much.
[15:43.95]I really appreciate it.
[15:46.60]Ten bucks.
[15:48.32]Okay, close this door.
[15:49.22]Don't do that again, please.
[15:55.19]Keep the chairs.
[16:01.27]Someone's face is going to be right here.
[16:04.42]Clean the floor.
[16:05.30]Take the mop from the staff room and clean the dirt spots.
[16:07.89]God damn it.
[16:24.99]Do you guys do that too?
[16:25.62]You guys check every single room?
[16:40.65]You walk around and you just go like, oh, man, oh, man.
[16:45.12]Such a, I love, I love being armed with a machine gun.
[16:49.42]You know what I mean?
[16:50.21]Like, what the fuck?
[16:51.39]Wait, you got a machine gun?
[16:52.15]I'm out of here.
[16:55.25]Wait, I can't clean this?
[17:01.42]Paranoid?
[17:13.15]Like if I thought I was like alone, but I didn't know.
[17:17.28]Like if I'm like, wait, is somebody in here?
[17:18.92]Oh my fucking God.
[17:19.60]Who's in the fucking place?
[17:22.09]Or who's in my restaurant?
[17:23.75]It's closed.
[17:25.15]Like, oh man, I'm just mopping up back here.
[17:27.65]God, it's so odd.
[17:28.38]It's crazy.
[17:29.20]Yeah, dude, I'll put you on the phone.
[17:30.28]Like, yeah, dude, like I won my second black belt tournament again.
[17:33.86]Yeah, I fucking destroyed this dude.
[17:36.21]It was bad, dude.
[17:37.09]I fucking, he was like, it was bad.
[17:41.47]Yeah, it's the second knockout I've had in my really, really short career.
[17:45.83]Stuff like that.
[17:54.17]Yeah, dude, what does that make it?
[17:55.47]Oh, well, I don't want to, like, brag, but yeah, it makes it about... Yeah, that makes it, like, fucking 20 knockouts and zero losses ever.
[18:08.94]If I'm, like, a burglar, like, oh, shit!
[18:11.73]These guys might be fucked up.
[18:12.77]I don't know if I want to do this anymore.
[18:17.21]I haven't introduced the coffee series to the menu.
[18:19.22]Okay.
[18:23.60]Strawberry boba.
[18:24.80]Or strawberry pieces.
[18:29.65]They did that in the show Barry.
[18:44.53]Okay, so we got coffee now.
[18:50.30]Don't scare me.
[18:51.34]Oh, he's back.
[18:51.90]Did he like it?
[19:00.52]So you've added some coffee drinks to the menu.
[19:03.00]Give me one boba milk tea and one Americano.
[19:25.12]Here you are, sir.
[19:27.06]Don't turn your back on him.
[19:29.00]Don't say that.
[19:36.99]That milk's been out all shift.
[19:41.34]It's alright.
[19:43.82]Just a heads up for you.
[19:45.26]I'll be running maintenance on the electrical circuit of this building, so expect some power outage from time to time.
[19:50.85]Oh, great.
[20:02.59]Give me two boba strawberry milk tea.
[20:04.72]Hurry up.
[20:05.00]I need my energy replenishment after a whole day of working out.
[20:08.76]Strawberry... Two strawberry boba milk tea.
[20:26.33]There's one?
[20:28.47]Wait, did I put... Yes.
[20:33.09]Here's the other one.
[20:44.62]Here we go.
[20:45.44]One.
[20:46.90]Two.
[20:47.12]Okay.
[20:55.19]What took you so long?
[20:56.15]I almost died of exhaustion.
[20:57.36]That was actually really quick.
[21:09.61]It's you.
[21:10.01]Hi.
[21:10.61]Yeah, you added strawberry into your menu.
[21:12.17]Please make me any drink with strawberry in it.
[21:16.12]Take care.
[21:16.48]Here we go.
[21:20.38]Just making sure she was still there.
[21:21.76]Okay.
[21:46.07]Hey, how about some, how about extra boba and extra strawberries?
[21:54.64]For your suggestion.
[22:02.90]By the way, here's, why did it do that?
[22:05.34]It just like ripped my controller up here.
[22:08.84]Did you not pay your electricity bill, big sis?
[22:11.63]Here's a little extra for your electric bill.
[22:17.49]This girl's loaded.
[22:23.83]God damn it.
[22:24.33]God damn it.
[22:24.71]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[22:31.28]What's wrong with your store?
[22:32.10]What was that?
[22:36.33]There's no electricity.
[22:37.69]Anyway, give me a cup of strawberry milk tea.
[22:48.32]No, Boba?
[23:05.96]Thanks for doing your job.
[23:09.69]I saw something like fall from here.
[23:17.72]Phone?
[23:23.00]Hey there, it's me again from just now.
[23:26.07]Just want to inform you that I have completed the electrical maintenance.
[23:28.81]You shouldn't be experiencing any power outage anymore.
[23:31.35]That's all.
[23:31.83]Bye.
[23:40.13]Oh, this place is a really cozy vibe.
[23:42.31]So many choices.
[23:43.65]I don't even know where to start.
[23:45.47]You have any caffeinated milky drinks?
[23:48.16]We sure do.
[23:57.22]How about a boba latte?
[24:06.78]Call Dracula.
[24:07.46]He's crying.
[24:10.25]Dracula didn't show up until the last 10 seconds of that movie, or whatever the fuck it was.
[24:15.37]Ah, just how I like my caffeine.
[24:16.52]Smooth, creamy, and milky.
[24:18.36]Here's a little tip for making it how I like it.
[24:24.21]You're welcome.
[24:24.67]Goodbye.
[24:39.34]Don't do it.
[24:50.43]They're gonna scream at me.
[25:15.74]Okay.
[25:18.61]Use the mop as a weapon?
[25:27.16]Foxy's right behind you, dude.
[25:29.10]Chocolate's now on the menu.
[25:42.69]Doesn't look like there's room for anything else.
[25:43.95]I think this is the last day.
[25:57.71]Give me a cup of boba mocha.
[26:00.14]Make sure you do it right.
[26:03.48]Shut up.
[26:16.55]Did I do it right?
[26:24.98]Yeah, it looks good.
[26:25.60]Hey, have you heard about the woman who jumped from this building?
[26:29.61]That's what I think was in the corner of my screen.
[26:35.34]Corporate life isn't easy, but some of us have an image to maintain.
[26:38.87]You wouldn't get it working a low-stress job like this.
[26:45.40]That was fucked up.
[26:55.17]Oh, he's back.
[26:59.08]Well, hey there.
[26:59.80]Nice to see you again.
[27:00.82]Could you give me one chocolate milk?
[27:02.84]I've had enough caffeine this morning.
[27:06.87]Ah!
[27:07.27]What was that?
[27:08.99]There's like a fucking person in the corner.
[27:11.22]Was I supposed to see that?
[27:13.44]I feel like it was loading up a scary thing.
[27:15.22]Are you- What are you doing?
[27:16.22]Somebody in here?
[27:21.31]What was that?
[27:22.71]What do you mean that wasn't anything?
[27:23.93]Yes, it was.
[27:24.71]There was like a fucking weird, scary man crawling into the corner.
[27:31.98]I'm sorry about that, sir.
[27:33.32]I will get right on your chocolate milk.
[27:40.21]Hey.
[27:41.15]Crazy weather we're having, huh?
[27:42.67]First it's hot, then it's cold.
[27:44.56]I'd have my AC and my heater turned on in the same day.
[27:48.77]And it's rain?
[27:50.11]Haven't had that in about two or three months.
[27:55.14]You know, you can just have the fucking container, okay?
[28:10.70]Thank you.
[28:17.10]I'm telling you, there was a weird guy crawling in the corner.
[28:20.43]I'm getting a total 180 FOV of the whole game.
[28:29.16]Give me a double boba strawberry chocolate milk.
[28:32.67]Make it quick.
[28:33.79]Double boba strawberry chocolate milk.
[28:36.47]Double strawberry boba.
[28:38.01]Double chocolate strawberry boba chocolate milk.
[28:40.40]Double boba chocolate strawberry boba milk.
[28:43.30]What is it?
[28:44.20]Double boba strawberry chocolate milk.
[28:46.51]Double boba strawberry chocolate milk.
[29:00.02]Bo-bo-bo, bo-bo-bo-bo.
[29:03.40]Coming up next on Adult Swim is bo-bo-bo, bo-bo-bo.
[29:10.48]I remember that ad.
[29:13.11]Alright, is it bo-bo-bo, bo-bo-bo, or bo-bo-bo, bo-bo-bo-bo?
[29:18.06]Which one is it?
[29:29.85]Hi, miss.
[29:30.81]I really like your boba tea.
[29:31.69]My dad always gets it for me.
[29:33.13]Oh, that's cool.
[29:36.70]But he's super busy today, and so I came to get it for him instead.
[29:41.18]Can I have one boba milk tea and one mocha, please?
[29:47.27]One boba milk tea and one mocha.
[29:58.79]Boba milk tea?
[30:07.31]You good?
[30:23.87]What time is it right now?
[30:31.88]I- guys, my computer is wrong.
[30:35.12]It says it's 623 on my computer.
[30:44.72]Maybe that's why I like my dashboard so fucked up.
[30:49.01]Why is it?
[30:49.57]Why am I in the Bermuda Triangle?
[30:51.66]What's going on?
[30:53.04]Why is that?
[30:55.84]That's really weird.
[30:58.61]Because I've got an ad break coming up, but I can't usually I can see it so I can plan a break around it.
[31:03.56]But my computer is like 10 minutes into the past.
[31:07.92]OK, weird.
[31:12.48]a weird day today huh alright what else do you want mocha you just want chocolate that's all you want now that's chocolate milk mocha is do you want mocha coffee and
[31:44.63]There you go.
[31:46.69]Thanks, miss.
[31:48.11]Waiting for my dad every day is so boring.
[31:51.86]Yeah, can one of the mods snooze the ads when they pop up?
[31:54.40]Like in a minute or whatever, once it gets down to like 30 seconds?
[32:06.46]They don't happen to have any matcha drinks, do you?
[32:09.12]I do not.
[32:10.01]It's a shame.
[32:10.49]I really love matcha.
[32:12.03]Oh, well, in that case, I'll take a boba chocolate.
[32:15.44]Okay.
[32:18.69]Just chocolate and boba?
[32:19.91]That sounds... kind of... kind of a lot.
[32:25.24]Did somebody go in the bathroom there a few minutes ago?
[32:33.49]Thanks.
[32:33.69]Seriously, add some matcha to the menu and you'll see me here all the time.
[32:39.92]Somebody's been in that bathroom for a long time.
[32:55.30]Hello there, sweetie.
[32:56.04]Such a lovely little shop you have here.
[32:58.26]Could I have a cup of strawberry chocolate, please?
[33:09.80]Sure.
[33:17.49]Thank you, sweetie.
[33:18.57]You look a little pale, like you've seen a ghost or something.
[33:21.71]Make sure you get enough sleep, dear.
[33:22.80]Night can be unkind to the restless.
[33:28.22]It's closing time.
[33:28.86]I should probably check if anyone's still in the toilet.
[33:30.57]Oh god, don't.
[33:32.07]Hold on.
[33:55.92]Bro, what the fuck?
[33:59.63]Ah!
[34:08.23]Sir, we're closing soon.
[34:09.34]Are you going to order?
[34:29.19]I'm seeing things lately.
[34:30.44]I should have leave early and get professional help.
[34:48.42]Dude, my clock is fucked.
[35:07.94]Don't ju- It's gonna jump out of the toilet at me.
[35:21.24]Is he gonna be a Skibidi Toilet fucking?
[35:22.76]He's gonna be in the toilet.
[35:26.56]I think your CMOS battery is fucked.
[35:28.59]My computer is fucked.
[35:30.97]But, it's okay.
[35:32.59]It's gonna be alright.
[35:34.35]Been feeling off lately.
[35:35.17]Maybe it's just the stress.
[35:36.55]I even went to see a psychologist about it.
[35:38.43]She said I'm fine, that it's all in my head.
[35:40.16]But I can't stop now.
[35:41.66]Business is picking up with a new menu and I need to keep things running.
[35:52.20]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[35:58.78]Hello, is this Miss Risa?
[36:00.56]This is Dr. Amanda, your psychologist from yesterday.
[36:03.69]I wanted to check in on you.
[36:04.47]You mentioned seeing things.
[36:05.73]That can happen when you're under a lot of stress.
[36:07.25]If you see something that isn't really there, try shifting your focus away from it and take a deep breath for a few seconds.
[36:11.90]Most of the time, that should help.
[36:13.52]But if it doesn't, maybe consider leaving work early and getting some rest.
[36:21.77]Okay.
[36:32.48]Give me two Americanos, one latte, and one mocha.
[36:35.85]Four?
[36:36.67]And none of that boba crap.
[36:39.31]Americano, Americano, latte, mocha.
[36:40.71]You got it.
[36:44.94]Americano.
[36:48.10]Americano.
[36:58.16]Well, you must like the coffee here.
[37:00.64]Rude.
[37:00.82]Rude.
[37:06.59]Latte and a mocha.
[37:08.13]Okay, so we go.
[37:26.90]Good.
[37:27.44]There you go.
[37:29.60]And that's it.
[37:34.77]You can play Voices of the Void?
[37:37.09]I thought about it.
[37:39.15]I think I really want to kind of dive into that.
[37:41.16]Really dive into that.
[37:43.84]Give it like the time it deserves.
[37:45.86]But not in the immediate future, but maybe soon here.
[37:48.83]Maybe eventually.
[37:50.19]Everything's here.
[37:50.73]Good.
[37:51.01]Hitting the road with my family.
[37:52.07]Got to keep them awake so they don't pass out on me.
[37:54.12]Later, loser.
[37:59.16]Have a nice day.
[38:12.67]Boba Matcha Latte.
[38:13.91]Make it quick.
[38:16.27]Do I have matcha?
[38:19.34]Oh, should I do?
[38:32.36]Boba Matcha Latte.
[38:34.06]And I did it very quickly.
[38:41.61]Running a company isn't easy, you know.
[38:43.51]Just the other day, one of my employees decided to run away from her responsibilities.
[38:48.60]Left a mess behind, and now I have to clean it up for her.
[38:52.55]Unlike her, I don't get the luxury of walking away.
[38:54.65]Hundreds of people were relying on me to feed their families.
[38:58.19]Thankfully, I found a replacement fast.
[39:00.50]Sorry, that was a weird thing to rant about.
[39:02.36]Here, consider it a little extra for your trouble.
[39:04.90]50 bucks?!
[39:05.65]!
[39:23.31]I hate when they take so long to come in.
[39:27.48]You've added matcha?
[39:28.22]That's awesome.
[39:28.80]Can I have a boba strawberry matcha milk tea?
[39:32.14]Sure.
[39:33.23]Boba?
[39:34.55]What do you want?
[39:35.11]Boba?
[39:36.71]The fuck are you doing?
[39:52.81]Stop it!
[39:53.41]Stop doing that!
[39:54.41]Boba matcha... What do you want?
[39:56.87]Boba... Boba strawberry matcha milk tea.
[40:00.62]Boba strawberry matcha... Fucking say it correctly!
[40:03.70]Boba strawberry matcha milk tea.
[40:07.11]What is it?
[40:07.89]Boba strawberry... Boba strawberry.
[40:18.36]No!
[40:18.56]No coffee!
[40:19.25]Get this out of here!
[40:25.32]Oh, it's because I haven't done a tea in like 10 customers.
[40:39.48]There.
[40:39.76]Bulbous strawberry matcha milk tea.
[40:50.59]Thank you.
[40:51.31]Here's something extra for you.
[40:52.31]Five bucks.
[40:58.30]What did you take before this stream?
[41:04.22]I'm playing a horror game.
[41:05.10]What are you talking about?
[41:10.93]Please make me any drink with strawberry again.
[41:14.51]I love when the customers are easy.
[41:23.24]How about like a strawberry milk?
[41:25.77]A strawberry boba, boba strawberry milk with a lemon slice.
[41:34.56]That sounds pretty good.
[41:43.17]Thank you again, big sis.
[41:44.35]Here's a little extra.
[41:50.09]Oh, I earned 300 bucks.
[41:52.97]Damn.
[41:53.74]Okay.
[42:02.39]Give me a strawberry mocha.
[42:19.31]OK.
[42:19.39]Don't be gonna be weird when I turn around.
[42:26.58]We got one snooze left that will do the last news and I'll take a break.
[42:31.33]Great, now back to work.
[42:44.53]Is this blood?
[42:45.17]That's blood.
[42:46.35]There's blood all over the floor.
[42:52.42]Should I just... I don't like that.
[42:54.45]I'm cleaning that up.
[43:16.55]Okay.
[43:19.86]I'm going to take a break.
[43:21.66]The night is young.
[43:22.81]I feel like I'm going to go pretty long tonight.
[43:24.97]So you should strap in.
[43:27.66]Let's take a quick break.
[43:28.32]I'll be back in three minutes.
[43:30.82]And we'll see you in a few minutes.
[43:32.65]We'll see.
[43:33.01]I feel like the conclusion of this one's coming up and I'm very, very curious about it.
[43:36.05]Be right back.
[49:14.03]Hello, I'm back.
[49:17.92]Let us continue.
[49:21.30]Alright, clean up.
[49:22.69]Good to go.
[49:34.06]Keep, oh, I can't use the mop, right?
[49:44.22]And the shift.
[49:47.57]Hey, can you say bia for the boys?
[49:51.56]Bia!
[49:53.62]Is that how you wanted me to say it?
[49:56.75]I haven't really been feeling like myself lately.
[49:58.49]Maybe it's just stress or not getting enough sleep.
[50:01.44]I got a business to run and people to stay... Yeah, yeah.
[50:04.52]Can I keep going one cup at a time?
[50:14.73]I can't believe how fucking dog shit Dracula 3 is.
[50:18.32]It's shocking to me.
[50:31.87]Could I get one boba milk tea and one boba americano?
[50:35.19]Oh, somebody's coming around to the boba.
[50:38.07]Okay.
[50:39.61]My son finally talked me into trying it.
[50:41.62]Guess there's a first time for everything.
[50:44.28]Hey, look at that.
[50:49.85]You came around.
[50:57.12]Boba milk tea and a boba americano, you said, right?
[51:21.17]That's going to scream and I'm going to scream.
[51:27.76]It sucks because I've been drinking a little bit, right?
[51:29.50]Like I'm drinking.
[51:30.80]That means extra screams, by the way.
[51:37.77]That's like a 30% scream addition, honestly.
[51:48.20]Drunk off cranberry juice.
[51:53.01]Uh, not quite.
[51:55.82]These damn things choke me to death.
[51:57.12]I'm coming back to haunt you.
[52:07.87]Is this the right idea?
[52:08.67]Why is there somebody still... Get out of here.
[52:25.89]Dearie, could I have a cup of green tea, please?
[52:29.69]Yes.
[52:35.56]How would I do that?
[52:36.36]Just milk?
[52:36.92]Just... Milk and green tea?
[52:39.94]Milk and matcha powder?
[52:43.17]That's matcha milk.
[52:45.23]Do I have access just to water?
[52:46.67]Oh, okay.
[53:07.28]The yin energy in this place is strong.
[53:08.90]Gives me goosebumps.
[53:10.82]I better leave while I still can.
[53:14.85]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[53:21.81]Do you want a drink?
[53:23.67]Is this a customer?
[53:28.52]Double boba matcha milk tea.
[53:31.66]The ghost wants a drink.
[53:34.54]Double boba matcha milk tea.
[53:36.36]Hurry or else.
[53:58.61]Go!
[54:01.68]I did that as fast as I fucking could!
[54:15.29]I failed it.
[54:17.40]Ow!
[54:23.71]Double boba matcha milk tea.
[54:25.63]How did I- I did that fucking fast as fuck!
[54:36.11]I'm just, you know what?
[54:36.91]Fuck this.
[54:37.39]Watch this.
[54:37.79]Ready?
[54:47.09]I'm just having it ready for the ghost.
[54:54.82]We're pre-gaming on this.
[55:08.61]Okay.
[55:09.75]It'll stay nice and cold.
[55:11.16]Good.
[55:22.07]Let's go.
[55:24.31]You're going to give her an old-ass drink?
[55:25.94]That is chilled to a perfect 32 degrees Fahrenheit south.
[55:34.91]One Boba milk tea, one Boba Americano.
[55:36.33]You got it.
[55:49.82]Oh no, that's a latte.
[55:50.76]Hold on.
[56:01.74]Boba Americano.
[56:02.78]Boba milk tea.
[56:13.38]I hope she doesn't order something different.
[56:23.91]These things choke.
[56:25.17]Yeah, I'm coming back to haunt you.
[56:26.15]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:29.11]Alright, here we go.
[56:34.74]I don't know this one more, right?
[56:36.06]Matcha milk, right?
[56:38.31]Oh, just green tea?
[56:39.13]Yeah, green tea.
[56:46.54]Alright, do you think she can see her drink?
[56:48.64]Is that bad?
[57:00.17]Yep.
[57:00.51]Yin energy is creepy.
[57:01.61]Gives me goosebumps.
[57:02.35]Goodbye.
[57:02.86]Okay.
[57:03.22]Thank you.
[57:13.27]Double bubble matcha milk tea.
[57:14.51]Hurry.
[57:22.20]Thank you.
[57:24.02]She pays?
[57:25.04]She actually pays.
[57:29.20]Okay.
[57:30.65]I mean, I feel like you didn't have to pay, but I'll take it.
[57:35.95]That was a good tip, too.
[57:37.26]That was like five bucks.
[57:41.70]Hello, nice to meet you.
[57:43.44]I'm an inspector from the Department of Health.
[57:45.55]I need to run a quick cleanliness check on your shop.
[57:48.83]Make sure that your shop meets the standard needed.
[57:51.11]Don't worry.
[57:52.29]You can continue serving your customers normally.
[57:54.46]Just pretend I'm not here.
[57:58.88]I cleaned up.
[58:01.55]I take care of my place.
[58:04.71]I remember looking at the chat and people were like, idiot, wasting time, wasting time.
[58:08.20]What happened to Dracula 3?
[58:10.22]Where's Dracula 3?
[58:11.70]They get timed out immediately.
[58:14.81]Hi, big sis.
[58:15.77]Kind of bored as strawberry.
[58:16.71]Can I try a lemon tea instead?
[58:21.90]Sure.
[58:29.42]Oh shit, she's going to the bathrooms.
[58:30.71]I haven't been in there in a while.
[58:38.36]Thank you, big sis.
[58:41.62]We're good.
[58:43.62]Why is it so dark in here?
[58:45.89]It is pretty dark, isn't it?
[58:50.23]What if the ghost gets her?
[58:51.90]The ghost is a paying customer.
[58:54.12]Anything matcha and sweet will do.
[58:56.54]Too tired to choose.
[58:57.63]Okay.
[59:01.01]How about a milk matcha strawberry?
[59:08.32]A strawberry matcha milk.
[59:27.13]That milk was brand new.
[59:28.11]I just didn't like it.
[59:31.66]That's not what I ordered.
[59:32.80]What?
[59:39.65]Didn't you say anything as long as it was sweet?
[59:41.07]Isn't there straw?
[59:41.57]Wait, I don't get it.
[59:43.31]What the hell do you want?
[59:48.59]How about just a chocolate milk?
[59:58.78]Here, have like a boba chocolate milk.
[60:01.15]It's fine.
[60:06.76]Boba in your boba?
[60:07.42]You don't have to get boba at a boba shop.
[60:08.98]That's not what I ordered.
[60:10.76]What do you want?
[60:11.32]I don't get it.
[60:15.45]Anything matcha?
[60:16.21]Oh, matcha.
[60:24.04]Wouldn't this be kind of gross?
[60:25.82]A chocolate matcha?
[60:28.55]What is sweet?
[60:30.29]I put strawberries in it and she didn't like it.
[60:31.87]What do I have that's got sugar in it?
[60:35.60]I couldn't put the matcha in the chocolate.
[60:54.15]I can't put it in the chocolate milk.
[60:56.88]Do a boba matcha tea?
[61:05.03]How is this not sweet?
[61:26.40]Boba matcha milk tea.
[61:27.86]That's fucking wonderful.
[61:29.32]That's perfect.
[61:35.03]I've tried so many different combinations.
[61:37.46]She doesn't want anything.
[61:39.46]It's alright, I guess.
[61:41.08]Well, come with an order.
[61:42.77]Don't go to the coffee shop and go, um, I don't know what I want.
[61:45.65]Make me something.
[61:47.31]Okay, well, here's a Americano with whipped cream on it.
[61:51.16]I don't want that.
[61:52.04]Well, fucking come with an order then.
[61:53.38]I completed the inspection of your shop.
[61:56.93]Luckily, your shop was met the bare minimum.
[61:59.37]Hope to see improvements next time.
[62:00.68]Okay, we're good.
[62:02.74]I don't feel so good.
[62:03.84]I should leave the office.
[62:10.51]Uh-oh.
[62:10.65]It's like you're gonna drive up to like the McDonald's drive-thru window and go, I don't know, surprise me.
[62:17.12]They're gonna go, uh, sir, what do you want?
[62:20.15]Like, what do you, get the, get out of my drive-thru.
[62:36.71]Sometimes I do that at Dunkin Donuts.
[62:39.77]No, dude.
[62:41.03]What are you doing?
[62:41.98]The order.
[62:44.28]Oh, the order is a medium iced blueberry coffee with two sugars and almond milk.
[62:53.01]And if you're feeling cool and a little bit frisky, a chocolate cream filled donut.
[63:00.49]I'm talking about the chocolate donut, the chocolate cream filled donuts.
[63:05.47]Look at all these people in the chat.
[63:07.11]Look at all these fucking morons.
[63:09.63]Look at them.
[63:10.43]They disgust me.
[63:11.97]Oh, look, that's so gross, gross.
[63:13.76]They disgust me.
[63:20.40]The things I see, sometimes they're there, sometimes they're not.
[63:23.29]I don't know what's even real anymore.
[63:25.07]But this shop is my dream.
[63:26.81]I've worked too hard to let it all fall apart now.
[63:29.23]So I'll smile, I'll serve, and I'll keep going.
[63:34.10]I feel like this is going to be a scary ending.
[63:37.12]Duncan Blueberry is actually fire.
[63:39.87]Thank you.
[63:40.89]The one guy in chat that gets it.
[63:47.99]It is the best iced coffee I've ever had in my life.
[63:51.42]And that is a full true statement.
[64:04.29]How many sugars?
[64:04.93]Do two or three in a medium.
[64:08.20]Not four.
[64:09.64]I think the normal, a regular is four.
[64:11.74]I usually cut it in half.
[64:12.56]I usually do two.
[64:16.46]Had the best road trip of my life.
[64:18.37]And look at you, still slaving away behind the counter.
[64:20.85]What a loser.
[64:22.27]Anyway, give me a matcha latte and a strawberry mocha.
[64:30.00]Dude.
[64:46.70]Strawberry mocha, coming right up, sir.
[65:03.52]I think there's gonna be another coffee odor from the ghost.
[65:10.17]And I gotta get it right.
[65:12.87]Nice!
[65:13.35]You do know how to follow instructions.
[65:15.15]Guess even losers can learn.
[65:19.59]Bro, who goes... What do you want?
[65:21.59]What do you want?
[65:22.21]What do you want?
[65:22.89]I can make a boba.
[65:23.91]I can make you chocolate.
[65:24.85]I can make you tea.
[65:25.44]I can make you green tea.
[65:27.88]What do you... I can do all... I can do three orders.
[65:29.24]I can do three.
[65:30.62]We got a matcha over here.
[65:31.50]We got a fucking green tea over there.
[65:32.69]We've got a... I'm going... I'm hiding.
[65:41.70]Just give me any strong coffee, no milk, and make it quick.
[65:44.46]Some of us have jobs to get to.
[65:45.98]Strong coffee.
[65:59.85]For a second there, I thought I'd have to teach you how to brew coffee.
[66:02.32]Why do people keep coming in here and saying that?
[66:06.52]Well, it looks like you're stupid enough to make a coffee.
[66:08.72]I thought I had to teach you.
[66:09.83]It looks like you're dumb enough.
[66:11.21]It's like, dude, you're in my coffee shop.
[66:13.01]You don't think I know how to make a coffee?
[66:14.67]I opened this place.

[66:28.37]Boba matcha milk tea.
[66:49.45]Just, like, fucking karate chop the neck.

[68:36.31]Okay.
[68:36.43]Hold on a second.
[68:37.07]I want to see this.
[68:38.73]I want to see this on the big screen.
[68:44.76]Yeah, that's a scary reaction to a scary video game.
[68:52.53]I think that's a perfectly normal reaction to this.
[69:10.28]Yeah, this is a normal human reaction.
[69:14.66]That's not too out of control.
[69:15.93]That's not weird.
[69:16.73]That's not fucked up or anything.
[69:18.43]I'm playing a scary game and I just got scared.
[69:20.99]That's not weird.
[69:27.60]I look like such a fucking YouTuber, you know?
[69:30.02]That's like a YouTuber thumbnail.
[69:32.57]Alright, I'm not gonna scream for the rest of the entire night.
[69:44.58]Why are you so intense?
[69:45.63]Dude, if, okay, if I just, whatever.
[69:51.89]You tell me I gotta go in this locker?
[69:53.48]Ain't no way I'm fitting in that locker.
[70:00.73]Uh-huh, road trip.
[70:01.95]Yep.
[70:03.39]Matcha latte, strawberry mocha.
[70:05.03]You got it.
[70:13.50]It's probably the bathroom.
[70:14.64]I probably have to go in the toilet.
[70:24.23]Shit.
[70:26.21]And now I'm all flustered.
[70:31.32]No, that was right.
[70:42.42]Oh, you piece of shit, really?
[70:58.59]I think it's the toilet.
[70:59.67]I don't, I honestly don't think it's in the, in the, like, room closet.
[71:07.47]Alright.
[71:08.11]Dracula themed drink.
[71:10.22]Cranberry juice and vodka.
[71:11.76]Looks like blood.
[71:28.17]Stop.
[71:33.02]Okay, so this is... It's all open.
[71:36.56]I guess I can... Can I fit in here?
[71:37.83]I can fit in here.
[71:42.75]Imagine testing that.
[71:44.92]Strong coffee.
[71:45.60]You got it.
[71:48.46]All the ghosts had to have seen me do that.
[71:54.79]Alright, here we go.
[72:00.71]Thank you.
[72:01.21]Oh, no, there's one more.
[72:06.34]There's one more.
[72:17.60]Boba matcha milk tea.
[72:19.37]Uh-huh.
[72:33.48]Boba matcha milk tea.
[72:38.12]And away we go.
[72:44.37]That scared the shit out of me.
[72:45.49]Alright, here we go.
[73:02.14]Ah!
[73:23.09]No, no!
[73:24.23]I told you I had to go to the fucking bathroom!
[73:31.72]Is it safe?
[73:39.45]I'm here, hello.
[73:41.01]Where the hell have you been?
[73:42.07]I've been ringing that bell for ten minutes.
[73:44.18]Not everyone has time to sit around and wait for you to finish whatever you're doing.
[73:47.84]Could've walked to another cafe.
[73:49.22]Okay, okay, okay.
[73:51.05]Okay, okay, okay, okay!
[73:52.42]Okay!
[73:53.72]Okay, okay, okay!
[74:02.28]I need to pee so bad.
[74:04.20]I'll just get a drink from here and use their toilet.
[74:25.31]Hi there, what can I get you today?
[74:28.59]Okay, this is a big deal.
[74:36.36]It's been eliminated.
[74:45.27]It's been eliminated.
[74:47.84]I'll take a bubble chocolate milk.
[74:51.75]Yeah, and can I have the toilet, please?
[74:53.44]I'm very so sorry.
[74:54.16]Our toilet is for staff only.
[74:56.81]Please wait a moment.
[74:57.49]One boba chocolate milk coming right up.
[75:01.16]Toilet for staff only?
[75:02.06]Screw that.
[75:03.15]I'll sneak into the toilet while she's making my drink.
[75:23.43]Who would do such a thing?
[75:24.41]I need to leave immediately and call the police.
[75:38.87]I mean, I still want the drink.
[75:51.51]That does not... I mean, I still want my beverage.
[76:19.55]Don't touch that.
[76:25.34]So I was the killer the whole time?
[76:29.31]Wait, where's she going?
[76:45.24]Where's my drink?
[76:56.32]I ordered a chocolate milk with boba in it and I expect to get it.
[77:01.03]I'm leaving a four.
[77:03.29]No, a 3.5.
[77:06.80]Cleanliness, four and a half.
[77:09.80]Customer service, one.
[77:12.85]Taste, I don't know.
[77:14.43]I'm going to leave it as one out of five stars because I don't know.
[77:17.80]And I'm going to say I don't know.
[77:31.59]I told you the toilet is for staff only.
[77:34.68]But nobody ever listens, not when they look at me like I'm a failure.
[77:40.54]But they kept coming in with their eyes staring, judging.
[77:46.47]The shop is my sanctuary, my little world.
[77:50.90]Oh no.
[77:52.46]I can't let you ruin it.
[77:55.60]Not you, not her, not the shadows.
[78:00.90]I don't want this, but you left me no choice.
[78:12.77]It's a shame that you don't get to enjoy my boba drink.
[78:18.32]I mean, there's still time.
[78:31.90]that was a good one that's fun I think there was just enough jump scares there was just enough kind of keeping you on the edge that was a good one I like it that was boba tea shop
[79:03.75]Dude, Mike made this game?
[79:13.20]Cool.
[79:13.32]Alright, is there a post-credits scene?
[79:25.50]Hey, upcoming games.
[79:28.70]That was good.
[79:29.07]I like it.
[79:33.16]That was the Boba Tea Shop.
[79:35.58]If you want to scare your friends, tell them to play.
[79:40.99]Alright, how are we doing on time?
[79:41.91]We got about 30 minutes for the next break.
[79:43.85]We've got time.
[79:47.25]God damn it.
[79:49.35]I was wondering why it was doing that.
[79:50.69]Why is she getting so scary?
[79:51.80]But now I get it.
[79:56.64]Okay.
[79:56.76]Okay, the next one we are going to play is called... Where is it?
[80:01.12]Here.
[80:09.22]What about mouthwashing?
[80:11.12]People keep recommending it, but I don't know.
[80:13.29]I feel like it's long.
[80:14.05]I feel like everybody's done it already.
[80:16.19]I feel like if you've seen somebody play, you've probably seen like 10 people already do it.
[80:21.86]Eh, I don't know.
[80:22.70]It seems crazy, but let's see.
[80:28.07]It's like two hours.
[80:31.31]Eh, maybe.
[80:35.60]Alright, I got a couple of these I want to do.
[80:37.10]Let's do, that's bright.
[80:41.89]This one's called The Witch of Sherdon Forest.
[80:46.84]The Witch of Sherdorn Forest.
[80:50.18]Did I play this one?
[80:55.62]Maybe I didn't play this one yet.
[80:58.03]Am I crazy or did I play this one?
[81:05.13]This looks crunchy.
[81:08.01]This one is crunchy, by the way.
[81:09.54]This is like crunching.
[81:14.83]The Witch of Sherdorn Forest.
[81:19.34]22nd of March, 1335.
[81:23.76]Last night, the son of Lord Raleigh vanished.
[81:30.29]The boy was last seen in the valleys to the east.
[81:35.18]So the Lord sent his men to search the desolate hills.
[81:40.64]Yet the town's priest disagreed and spoke of his visions.
[81:45.98]Your boy traveled west, he told the Lord.
[81:49.73]Yet Raleigh was never a man of faith and ignored the priest.
[81:56.44]You, on the other hand, saw truth to the visions.
[82:00.49]They spoke to you.
[82:02.83]In the morning, you embarked west towards the forest.
[82:07.52]The Lord's prize would be great if you're able to return the boy.
[82:23.83]Flip phone graphics.
[82:53.57]Do I have any of the buttons or do I just kind of walk?
[83:03.44]Blood.
[83:05.98]The boy was here.
[83:22.16]I'm just going to follow the path.
[83:29.88]Blood.
[83:59.95]Oh, it's nighttime.
[84:03.42]I'll need wood for a fire.
[84:07.05]Okay, can I just get from any tree in the forest?
[84:15.28]I have to triangulate, otherwise I'm going to get lost.
[84:19.27]One of eight pieces of wood picked up.
[84:31.85]I think it actually is one of eight pieces of wood picked up.
[84:40.29]Can I get more than one?
[84:41.06]No.
[85:04.45]Is that enough shit?
[85:05.77]No, I need three more.
[85:13.34]Why do I feel such a sense of dread right now?
[85:15.46]I do.
[85:16.24]I don't know why.
[85:16.88]There is a because I know it's like the one of eight OK.
[85:29.27]They forbid searching West.
[85:38.81]The boy wandered into the valley.
[85:40.85]Yet here I am.
[85:49.86]I want you to see me act.
[85:59.71]I feel like something wanted me to come here.
[86:30.75]bros I see a light or something bros what do you think that is bros should I check it out you keep doing the same bit I
[87:00.28]I do keep doing the same routine, don't I?
[87:04.01]I do have one routine that I go to sometimes.
[87:07.59]It's one routine in like seven hours, okay?
[87:12.60]I don't know.
[87:13.20]I'm just such a facetious dick, I guess.
[87:16.07]I just find it to be funny.
[87:22.60]What is it?
[87:34.92]Bro, what do you think it is?
[87:37.79]Oh, it's the witch's house.
[87:39.97]Oh, I wonder if she has candy.
[87:42.55]Candy?
[87:43.15]Oh, I don't want to open this door.
[87:44.14]This door is weird.
[87:44.90]This is a weird door.
[87:46.74]No.
[87:52.31]No, dude.
[87:52.85]Who goes in here?
[87:53.77]Who walks in?
[87:54.59]Mm-mm.
[88:05.42]Ugh.
[88:08.72]It's so normal, right?
[88:10.70]That's like what's weird.
[88:11.46]That's what's freaking me out about this.
[88:12.55]It's like normal.
[88:33.21]I can't see shit.
[88:43.20]I need a light.
[88:44.52]Ugh!
[88:45.06]Why would I go in the basement?
[88:46.66]I'm free food for this fucking witch!
[88:50.53]Ah!
[88:53.57]Ah!
[88:54.64]What do I do?
[88:57.06]How do I turn the candle on?
[89:00.22]Ah!
[89:12.62]Sick!
[89:15.48]Good gameplay, so far.
[89:24.73]Anything else I can do in here?
[89:36.77]Oof.
[89:42.36]There are very few things in life that I think I would just refuse to do.
[89:44.91]Like besides, you know, there's a lot of things I wouldn't do, right?
[89:47.09]But I think the top of the list is walk through that door.
[89:57.23]I think this is probably in like the top three things that I would not do.
[90:08.10]So you'd stay a prisoner.
[90:10.02]No, I wouldn't go in the basement in the first place.
[90:11.83]Why would I do that?
[90:15.76]Something's gonna scream.
[90:45.91]Left control to crouch.
[90:57.50]What's that?
[91:17.59]Weird.
[91:31.80]Goblet.
[91:37.73]I need light.
[91:38.31]I need light.
[91:38.85]Give me the light, too.
[91:40.59]I can't take the light, too?
[91:58.06]Why would you drink that?
[92:14.54]It's a basin full of vodka cranberry.
[92:16.92]Oh.
[92:18.33]Okay.
[92:36.72]Whoa!
[92:39.02]Scenery change.
[93:03.36]Okay.
[93:29.96]Somebody said W key.
[93:31.88]I think it's good.
[93:32.65]I think it's... I'm freaked out.
[93:36.68]I'm completely freaked.
[94:00.18]I think they're getting smaller.
[94:01.34]They are.
[94:01.96]It's getting smaller and smaller.
[94:10.19]The candle colon completely freaked.
[94:19.27]Double candle.
[94:21.89]Can I do well candles?
[94:31.42]Oh, shit.
[94:35.20]Oh, boy.
[94:39.31]Oh, dear.
[94:47.82]I see a cage.
[94:50.84]Oh, no.
[94:51.44]Oh, there he is!
[94:52.30]The boy!
[94:57.45]Squire!
[94:57.99]Where are the four locks to open the four, uh... Okay, if you see that, I feel like that's just like, ah, shit, now what?
[95:16.99]Four locks?
[95:26.50]I'm just checking to make sure there's nothing on the ground.
[95:31.80]Need to release him.
[95:32.78]I'm gonna try.
[95:33.57]Uh... Somebody tell... Make sure to tell the, uh... I would say this is like a novice level saw.
[95:53.47]Novice level witch.
[95:55.87]I feel like, you know, an intermediate, hard, or insane level witch would not put all four keys in the same room.
[96:11.92]Alright.
[96:12.38]Shh.
[96:13.70]Don't talk.
[96:14.42]I got you.
[96:20.59]I'm going to go deepest first.
[96:33.79]I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost.
[96:34.91]I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[96:43.69]Oh, he's not alright.
[96:45.07]He's not okay.
[96:46.54]He's not alright.
[96:53.93]I think the witch... Oh!
[97:02.24]Oh, that was fucked up.
[97:04.19]Okay.
[97:15.62]Good job.
[97:16.18]That was a good one.
[97:18.97]That was a little twisted, but... Cool.
[97:24.17]That was the Witch of Sherdorn Forest.
[97:28.86]That was a quick little good one.
[97:33.83]What are we going to do next?
[97:38.26]Let's see.
[97:38.90]I got a few more.
[97:40.30]I got a lot more, actually.
[97:41.50]Not just a few.
[97:43.37]Okay, let's do... Did I do Decimate Drive already?
[97:56.18]No.
[97:57.79]This is another car game.
[98:02.93]I'm going to take a break here because I don't think I think it's going to end up hitting the.
[98:09.84]The break period.
[98:12.08]I definitely have not done this one.
[98:14.57]The game contains flashing lights and headphones are recommended.
[98:18.11]I enjoy headphones.
[98:21.80]Graphics are fine.
[98:22.74]Difficulty is.
[98:26.99]Fine, I think.
[98:34.85]OK.
[98:37.20]I think it looks fine.
[98:37.96]I think it looks good.
[98:40.62]I'm gonna take a break.
[98:41.29]I'll be back in three minutes and then we'll have another hour or so.
[98:45.90]I'm gonna play decimate drive when I get back back in two or three minutes.
[98:50.72]See you soon.
[104:14.02]How we doing?
[104:21.19]How are we?
[104:33.55]Big money?
[104:34.51]Somebody said making big money.
[104:35.82]Alright.
[104:36.40]Fucking yeah.
[104:37.18]Go for it, dude.
[104:39.24]Make some fucking big money.
[104:46.59]They can just do this should be easy to grab it.
[104:57.24]Alright, decimate drive.
[104:58.80]I heard the games fucked up.
[105:04.54]Can you see this?
[105:08.85]It's working today.
[105:10.73]Hey, is Dracula over?
[105:13.20]Yeah, we saw the ending of Dracula 3.
[105:16.38]And the ending was, I'd give it like a 2.
[105:20.02]The rest of the game was a 1.6.
[105:23.78]What's the title of the stream right now?
[105:27.31]What is the title?
[105:33.39]Destroying Dracula's car, warning flashing lights.
[105:42.23]Alright, that title is funny to me because it's like, hey, just want to give you a warning.
[105:47.82]As I smash up this guy's car with a sledgehammer and like burn it or whatever, there's going to be lights.
[105:51.90]There's going to be flashing lights.
[105:54.82]There you go, alright.
[105:58.03]Ah, story.
[105:59.55]Survive long enough to find out how you ended up in a killer car-infested city.
[106:05.28]What is this game?
[106:06.68]Find your way out of a remote backcountry shrouded in heavy fog...
[106:10.28]Or stay ahead of killer cars.
[106:12.08]What do you mean killer cars?
[106:18.41]Should I just do the story one?
[106:24.62]I'll just start with this, I guess.
[106:35.26]So what, it's like maximum overdrive?
[106:41.83]It's a Stephen King movie, isn't it?
[106:44.52]Or a Stephen King book.
[106:53.51]Damn night shifts.
[106:54.15]Let's head home.
[106:55.66]A, W, S, and D. Move around, yeah.
[106:59.62]Feels fine.
[107:10.13]The hair is blowing around.
[107:12.20]Fix the hair.
[107:15.98]Right, I'm parked in the hotel parking lot.
[107:17.99]Nearly there.
[107:18.61]Okay.
[107:19.47]Hold on just a second.
[107:20.39]Let's get that.
[107:22.59]Is there a mouse sensitivity?
[107:25.48]There is not.
[107:31.99]Eh, it's fine.
[107:38.60]I swear you played this?
[107:40.98]I don't think I've played this.
[107:50.50]Do the cars actually attack you?
[107:52.00]That's a funny twist.
[108:06.40]Isn't the hotel closed this time of year?
[108:09.48]Hmm.
[108:14.49]Ah!
[108:15.53]What?
[108:21.02]What just happened?
[108:21.56]Did somebody grab me from behind?
[108:37.10]What's that?
[108:38.74]Frank?
[108:52.16]Frank, I'm still tied up in the trunk.
[108:55.12]Or wherever I am in your car.
[108:56.35]I feel like you could use a little bit of a hand from another set of hands.
[109:03.01]Oh, I hate that sound.
[109:16.32]It's a fridge?
[109:21.29]Why is there a fridge?
[109:25.51]Scour.
[109:26.78]Okay, scour.
[109:29.98]Shit, where's Frank?
[109:33.14]Frank's dead.
[109:35.95]Why do I care about where Frank is?
[109:37.19]I should be happy that Frank's gone.
[109:42.43]I need to find help or a payphone or something.
[109:44.51]Damn, I need to get as far away from Frank as possible.
[109:55.23]Okay.
[109:55.35]What does this say?
[110:00.56]Notice to public.
[110:01.50]Bus service at this stop is permanently discontinued.
[110:03.66]We apologize for inconvenience.
[110:05.53]1997.
[110:05.85]Okay, this is the 90s.
[110:07.79]Dead end.
[110:16.36]Payphone.
[110:17.59]The harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are angels.
[110:27.06]Damn.
[110:36.38]Coming.
[110:39.08]It's gonna be Frank.
[110:46.40]Wait, what?
[110:50.11]Yeah, what did happen?
[110:56.92]Did that teleport with the phone?
[111:00.20]This is bad.
[111:00.68]Am I losing it?
[111:01.22]I need to find help right now.
[111:08.69]I'll go this way.
[111:11.24]Lighthouse.
[111:21.74]Another phone over here?
[111:58.61]This thing's ringing again.
[111:59.59]Wait, was that a car up there?
[112:02.36]Oh, the car is stalking me.
[112:04.72]That's a car up there.
[112:09.81]I don't know if I'm going to think this is scary.
[112:10.95]This might make me laugh.
[112:13.67]I think this might be like a funny game to me.
[112:17.90]This is going to be a funny game.
[112:18.74]I don't think it's going to be scary game.
[112:28.61]Okay.
[112:33.80]Sounds like someone is here.
[112:37.52]What do you mean?
[112:42.03]What?
[112:42.15]It's a car!
[112:43.29]It is a car trying to get me!
[112:50.70]You're too big to do that!
[112:52.40]You're too big!
[112:54.36]This is not a horror game.
[112:55.73]This is gonna be a funny game.
[113:07.76]Do I have a sprint?
[113:18.06]This is going to be like what it feels like playing GTA Online.
[113:21.97]It's GTA Online simulator.
[113:37.95]Not enough explosions?
[113:39.28]Well, hold on.
[113:39.94]We just started.
[113:40.52]Hold on.
[113:42.12]Don't say that so soon.
[113:45.36]Something's wrong with that payphone.
[114:04.41]Left or right?
[114:05.27]I'm gonna say right.
[114:13.95]We've got we've got a weird baby thing We got a weird baby thing guys Fucked up Crying weird baby
[114:54.43]Something over here.
[115:00.82]Trash.
[115:03.25]Nothing in the trash.
[115:11.56]You look like Morbius.
[115:13.51]Time the person up for 45 minutes.
[115:32.35]Scour.
[115:33.47]Should I try to open the door?
[115:38.74]Nah.
[115:56.94]Chug it?
[115:59.06]Nah, I turned 40 this year, dude.
[116:00.76]We don't do that anymore.
[116:13.96]Until I see someone, these phones are my best bet.
[116:19.30]R is da- Okay, now I have a sprint and a jump and I have a dash.
[116:24.09]Okay.
[116:28.42]So I gotta get to the phones.
[116:45.28]Alright, I got to a phone.
[116:49.05]Ah, this one's messed up.
[117:14.51]Oh god, come.
[117:16.05]Oh god, there's a car!
[117:17.61]Can I hide?
[117:22.54]What a fucking idiot.
[117:24.56]Oh, oh, oh, oh, where is he?
[117:33.75]It's just GTA Online.
[117:36.65]Oh, there's a baby on that car!
[117:46.37]What the fuck?!
[117:55.34]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[117:59.00]Let's try that again.
[118:10.53]Yeah, this is... Okay, the only difference is what's missing is me talking over VoIP.
[118:16.27]Hey, does anybody want to team up for the heists?
[118:20.74]Hey, boom!
[118:21.60]Oh, I got run over.
[118:22.60]Hey, anybody want to heist?
[118:23.97]We need two more for heists.
[118:26.77]Wasted.
[118:27.27]Okay, I guess nobody wants to do heists.
[118:48.96]Alright, here we go.
[118:50.22]Lock in.
[119:12.38]He's back!
[119:13.34]Give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the phone, phone, phone, phone, phone!
[119:18.17]Oh, fuck!
[119:27.70]Shit, that was awful!
[119:28.85]I didn't know he was going to be right there!
[119:30.29]Is it toggle or is it hold?
[119:35.31]Is it toggle or is it hold?
[119:36.59]Sprint or press... Okay.
[119:45.04]Because I feel like I toggled it and it didn't work.
[119:48.50]Ah, that scared the shit out of me.
[119:50.19]That was actually kind of terrible.
[119:52.69]R is dash.
[119:53.29]Right, right, right.
[119:59.56]I'm going this way.
[120:10.56]Alright, completely avoided that one.
[120:23.63]OK, I'm going to cut through here.
[120:35.86]This game is fucking hard, man.
[120:44.48]What the hell?
[120:46.01]This game is hard.
[120:47.09]It's hard to run away from somebody in a car.
[121:03.03]Jump over the car?
[121:05.06]I'm gonna get crushed, man, if I jump over the car.
[121:09.67]Alright, I guess I gotta play it.
[121:10.87]It's not a horror game.
[121:11.73]It's just a game we have to just dodge shit.
[121:16.38]Alright, I'm gonna dodge it.
[121:19.27]It is so, it is scary though.
[121:30.42]It's run by the first one in Dodge and then grab the phone.
[121:34.73]Here we go.
[121:37.35]First one goes by.
[121:45.22]Second one comes around.
[121:47.22]Here comes.
[121:48.58]Dash.
[121:49.71]Got it.
[121:50.83]Got two.
[121:51.87]There it is.
[121:53.65]Jump.
[121:54.99]Grab phone.
[122:13.59]This is hard.
[122:16.01]OK, I'm going to say.
[122:17.65]Maybe I can get them to crash into each other.
[122:34.40]I gotta I gotta do some more like going around corners.
[122:40.67]Can I jump on top of stuff like this?
[122:42.45]I can.
[122:43.21]Will this protect me?
[122:47.10]I wonder if I could hit if I'm on top of this.
[122:51.07]Or jump on the dumpster.
[123:01.00]Yeah, I'm gonna do the strategy I did last time, which is this.
[123:04.12]I'm gonna hide back here.
[123:08.28]Yeah, I'm impervious to damage here.
[123:13.00]I'm going to get him trapped in the corner.
[123:20.02]He'll back up right here.
[123:22.10]He's going to be stuck.
[123:31.91]He's kind of fucked.
[123:35.04]Go on, get out of the fucking way, dude!
[124:14.65]Where is he?
[124:21.15]Where is he?
[124:21.69]Where is he?
[124:36.55]Yeah, they're relentless.
[124:39.41]You can dash, but you look.
[124:40.65]I can only dash every like 10 seconds.
[124:43.74]See, look, that's I can't dash.
[124:46.86]Maybe I'll start jumping.
[124:48.08]This is fucking insane.
[124:58.69]OK.
[124:58.77]What difficulty I'm on.
[125:01.90]I mean, I am on hard.
[125:09.19]I'm going to get a little more help.
[125:21.10]Reminds me the mini clip game with cars.
[125:24.02]I mean, the concept is great.
[125:25.38]I would love to get past the first level.
[125:29.97]I'll get it right here.
[125:34.69]I think ignore this one.
[125:35.78]Just he's going to go so fast.
[125:38.11]that just dash out of the way.
[125:40.59]Just do a double dash ready.
[125:50.77]I'm safe here.
[125:53.89]Wait till I gotta wait till he gets down here.
[126:02.52]Alright, well now they're completely useless idiots.
[126:07.64]Before, they were on top of me.
[126:09.71]Like butter on bread.
[126:12.35]And now they just don't know how to play the game anymore.
[126:29.48]Okay.
[126:29.60]I'm screwed!
[126:30.46]I gotta...
[126:38.98]I can move these.
[126:40.02]Oh, he fucked himself.
[126:47.13]Look it.
[126:47.41]He's... He ain't going anywhere.
[126:52.56]Whoa, there's a new one.
[126:53.32]There's a new one.
[126:56.54]Oh.
[127:10.72]Oh shit, here he comes!
[127:12.92]Where's the next phone?
[127:16.83]Get out of my way, please get out of my way!
[127:18.35]Please get out of the way.
[127:19.40]Please get out of the way.
[127:30.18]Ow, my arms!
[127:40.00]Jesus, please.
[127:41.52]Go go go go go go.
[127:50.13]I mean OK.
[127:55.24]Damn.
[127:56.66]This one's intense.
[128:01.41]Gunshots maybe Frank hasn't been able to get out either.
[128:13.61]The tank's gonna come alive and shoot at me?
[128:17.08]I doubt cars will do well on slippery ice.
[128:20.26]True, dude.
[128:21.08]I think that's coming alive.
[128:39.91]Alright, something's coming.
[128:46.67]Excuse me.
[129:00.11]Oh my god.
[129:03.60]It's the fucking meat grinder one that scares me the most.
[129:13.30]Get away from me!
[129:14.84]Why can he take- He's huge!
[129:16.16]Why can he take corners so well?
[129:27.66]God.
[129:40.32]It's all in my head, it must be.
[129:45.21]The giant one with the huge roller on the front is awful.
[129:50.16]It's so fast and it takes corners better than the regular cars.
[130:02.18]Batteries.
[130:04.99]Oh God.
[130:09.57]Oh great.
[130:18.59]Everybody alright in there?
[130:19.51]No, dude.
[130:29.78]Dude.
[130:50.11]Oh shit!
[130:50.99]You can go through wood!
[130:51.85]Dude, you can go through- you can rush through wood!
[130:59.72]This is like a fucking commercial for like the old RC cars!
[131:08.63]Where is he?
[131:13.48]Where is he?
[131:15.58]Where is he?
[131:16.68]Is he stuck?
[131:22.06]Oh my god!
[131:22.98]He's here.
[131:23.38]He's coming.
[131:33.77]See that play right there?
[131:34.69]Did you see that play?
[131:37.61]Just making sure you're paying attention.
[131:58.24]What does that mean?
[132:01.98]Oh my God, I'm sorry.
[132:10.94]No, dude.
[132:11.48]No, dude, I can't.
[132:12.77]I can't.
[132:13.45]I'm done with this one.
[132:16.37]This one's so stressful for a million different reasons.
[132:27.04]Oh my god!
[132:38.82]Free candy, bro!
[132:40.21]What are you talking about?
[132:42.09]Oh shit!
[132:47.04]No!
[132:47.62]I'm dead!
[132:50.75]Why would you write free candy on your van?
[132:57.74]What the fuck are you talking about?
[133:05.05]God damn it man.
[133:06.53]I was at the end.
[133:07.31]Is this like rainy like?
[133:09.96]No.
[133:14.55]No, if it was a granny-like, I'd have to go pick up the bubble gum from over here, put that under the sink over there, and then grab the fucking tube from underneath the sink, and then take the key that I found in the sink, and then put that in the door that opens up to go to the place where I get the pipe to put the pipe underneath where the original key was, but that doesn't work for the first door, and then take that first door key and put it into... No.
[133:32.54]Is that a granny-like?
[133:35.32]Oh, wow, somebody's chasing you around a house.
[133:37.53]No.
[133:38.19]Nope.
[133:40.27]Hey, please play more granny games.
[133:41.93]I will never play a granny-like for the rest of my life.
[133:56.48]You can't jump on the cars.
[133:57.86]Maybe you can?
[133:58.22]No, you can't.
[134:06.37]Oh, that hurt my head.
[134:08.24]I just had a headache from that.
[134:13.64]Why is it still right behind me?
[134:15.71]Oh, no, it's not.
[134:24.02]God damn it.
[134:25.70]Ugh.
[134:35.21]Thank God for the pistons!
[134:52.70]Oh, your engine is fried!
[134:55.07]Oh, God.
[135:05.57]Stuck?
[135:06.05]Good.
[135:12.83]It's right behind me.
[135:18.46]It's a bad start.
[135:19.91]It's a bad start.
[135:42.19]I don't know where he is!
[135:52.20]I don't know where he is!
[135:53.82]What was that car?
[135:57.96]Another car came out of the fog!
[135:59.46]Alright, alright, alright.
[136:07.13]Three more tries and I'm done.
[136:10.05]I'm not gonna scream.
[136:11.69]No more screaming.
[136:12.53]It's a scary game.
[136:14.09]I ain't screaming.
[136:21.68]I'm going straight shot.
[136:23.70]Turn right.
[136:24.59]Straight shot.
[136:25.67]Who gives a care about the person over there?
[136:30.27]Here they come.
[136:31.32]They scream, scream, scream.
[136:32.52]Oh no!
[136:32.94]Look out!
[136:34.02]Look out!
[136:40.69]Lock in.
[137:05.09]Stuck.
[137:05.73]Perfect.
[137:09.45]Wrapper on the right side.
[137:10.67]He stuck all the way back there.
[137:14.07]This is the best thing that could have happened.
[137:16.03]Here comes the loud rock music.
[137:19.48]Free candy just go.
[137:36.11]Good.
[137:39.84]Where?
[137:40.32]Where?
[137:41.10]Where?
[137:43.43]Shove it up your ass?
[137:52.76]Oh shit.
[137:53.44]Oh my god.
[137:54.28]Oh my god, where is it?
[138:15.21]Oh my God, those are gonna explode!
[138:35.57]Where is he?
[138:40.36]Where is he?
[138:41.00]I don't like going out here without knowing where he is.
[138:43.82]He's stuck.
[138:48.45]Yes, oh hell yeah.
[138:54.52]I'm exhausted.
[138:55.22]I can't spread anymore.
[139:05.44]Did I was just mayhem?
[139:08.68]Is that live music?
[139:17.93]I can't sprint anymore.
[139:20.54]Andrea, poor girl.
[139:21.50]Lost her mother and then had to fight the same disease.
[139:28.73]I did visit her a couple times after she left the hospital.
[139:32.71]Something's going to be behind me.
[139:33.71]I know it.
[139:41.90]If it wasn't enough for Frank, I still can't believe he did it.
[139:45.29]Shoving me in the trunk of his car and locking me in that basement.
[139:49.35]Frank is a little bit of a weirdo we're hearing about.
[139:56.56]That that damn letter take care of Andrea or else it read.
[140:02.19]Still can't sprint.
[140:05.77]The dead end.
[140:06.47]There's a car in this hallway.
[140:11.65]I swear to God.
[140:16.66]Need to keep moving to get out of here.
[140:40.96]Thankfully, there's a lot of random shit in the way I gotta get this my advantage.
[140:44.40]Take this cart with me.
[140:48.07]Oh my God, where is he?
[140:54.23]That didn't do anything that did not do anything at all.
[140:59.80]Oh my God, please.
[141:04.35]Alright, assess assess assess assess phone first phones right there.
[141:09.53]He's gonna go all the way around go.
[141:17.04]My whole body hurts.
[141:22.30]Thank God I was safe.
[141:45.42]Oh, shit!
[141:50.31]Okay, if the next phone is to the left... Roadworks, maybe I can trap one of the cars in here.
[142:00.64]Got it!
[142:06.25]Next phone, where's it?
[142:13.42]Next phone, where's the next phone?
[142:16.87]Dude, I'm getting invisible walled right now.
[142:25.89]It's okay.
[142:27.77]They both kind of stuck.
[142:29.85]I think it's this way.
[142:32.62]Yep.
[142:33.88]I hear it.
[142:42.67]That's a free candy van.
[142:47.77]Across the way?
[142:48.67]Okay, I gotta go across.
[142:49.76]Hold on, stay right here.
[142:52.68]Anybody coming?
[142:54.40]I hear an engine.
[142:58.63]I hear something.
[143:05.58]Thank God for these cement-made mailboxes.
[143:08.98]I was afraid it wasn't gonna work.
[143:19.99]Stay perpendicular.
[143:20.89]Perpendicular.
[143:27.50]Oh my God.
[143:35.76]I couldn't commit.
[143:36.40]I couldn't commit.
[143:37.04]I couldn't commit.
[143:38.46]I should have committed.
[143:39.16]Why did I not commit?
[143:39.94]He's stuck on the tree.
[143:49.18]OK, trap him over on this side.
[143:55.33]It comes.
[143:56.85]Go.
[144:05.70]Good shit, let's go.
[144:09.27]Fuck back away that way.
[144:14.97]Oh my God.
[144:17.61]Why did I not do that faster?
[144:18.95]I think I'm safe.
[144:38.90]Phew.
[144:42.08]Ah.
[144:45.44]I have to just commit.
[144:46.32]I hear more gunshots.
[144:59.53]I'm kind of addicted to this.
[145:02.24]This game is kind of addicting.
[145:03.32]It's kind of fun to outsmart the cars.
[145:06.16]I like this one.
[145:06.90]This one's fun.
[145:29.35]This is not going to be that easy, right?
[145:40.82]Fucking ice cream truck.
[145:48.83]I like that.
[145:49.37]That's great.
[145:50.65]Yeah, of course you make the little corridor.
[145:52.56]There's no way that's safe.
[146:00.92]I feel like I'm walking around on a twisted metal map.
[146:07.35]And I'm not supposed to be out of the car.
[146:10.20]Oh god.
[146:31.27]Oh, shit.
[146:34.27]Where'd the other one go?
[146:55.97]Oh, don't.
[146:57.37]Oh my god, there's another one.
[147:11.66]Threading the needle.
[147:13.57]That's all we're doing here is just threading the needle.
[147:18.45]We don't even need the trap.
[147:19.57]I'm good.
[147:20.89]No, I'm not.
[147:21.29]That's a lie.
[147:31.42]Trap one of them, dude.
[147:32.73]What's the point of the trap?
[147:34.81]That don't work on... That doesn't work.
[147:37.17]The trap didn't work.
[147:41.45]The trap doesn't work!
[148:03.76]Fuck outta here!
[148:04.44]Both of you dickheads!
[148:10.52]Oh my... I've never made a play like that in my whole life until right now.
[148:44.93]Holy shit!
[148:56.85]What the fuck are you talking about?

[149:17.36]I got it.
[149:18.04]I got it.
[149:20.54]The ice cream trucks are relentless.
[149:23.97]Alright, let's go.
[149:26.55]We're not going that way.
[149:27.35]I'm not gonna get tricked.
[149:28.05]Not gonna get baited.
[149:30.09]Death by the dumpster.
[149:30.93]I thought I could jump up and in I shit.
[149:40.54]Alright, I'm gonna lock in.
[149:42.93]I'm gonna go giga mode right now.
[149:44.71]Watch this.
[150:26.25]Who's this guy?
[150:40.13]This is a random guy, not another ice cream truck.
[150:42.30]Where's the other ice cream truck?
[150:43.62]That's just a guy.
[150:54.28]I think they both trapped each other.
[150:58.03]There's a third car.
[151:00.34]You've got to be kidding me.
[151:02.98]That actually might be good though.
[151:25.04]Son of a bitch!
[151:32.47]Son of a bitch!
[151:33.49]That got me bad!
[151:35.14]I thought he was on the other side of the map!
[151:50.06]I lost him.
[151:52.48]Alright, where's the phone?
[151:54.74]Where's the phone?

[152:46.03]Shit.
[152:47.53]I just heard a missile fall on me.
[152:56.74]Alright, I like this one a lot.

[153:15.56]He missed his Q.
[153:50.94]Dude, what the hell?
[153:52.13]I thought you were stuck on a thing!
[154:04.81]He got turned around in the best possible way.
[154:21.20]Perfect fucking angle.
[154:22.83]That was like the DVD screen hitting the logo, hitting the corner of the DVD thing.
[154:27.22]That's so annoying.
[154:30.49]I'm so pissed.
[154:35.22]It's right there.
[154:56.20]Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer true.
[155:02.75]I'm half crazy, all for the love of you.
[155:07.68]It won't be a stylish carriage.
[155:12.06]I can't afford a carriage.
[155:14.57]But, you know, it ain't a bomb, it ain't a bicycle, bam, bam, bam.
[155:28.13]Straight shot.
[155:44.22]Nope, not happening today.
[155:49.07]He's gone crazy.
[155:50.63]They go crazier when you get close.
[155:53.81]Oh my God, what have I done?
[155:55.66]I screwed up so bad.
[155:57.46]No, no, what did I do?
[155:59.76]I was too busy fucking talking shit about them.
[156:02.56]Alright, this is the one for real.
[156:07.17]This game is like I love this game.
[156:09.81]This game is awesome.
[156:13.56]This is a great game.
[156:14.80]This is like a high skill.
[156:16.30]I think this is a high skill ceiling game.
[156:31.42]Alright.
[156:32.13]I'm not talking at all.
[156:33.86]I got in my little jokes.
[156:35.13]I'm done.
[157:24.87]Does he wonder why I went this way?
[157:27.37]Because I want to bait that truck out.
[157:37.09]Third car crash idiot.
[157:43.90]I got shit behind me.
[157:44.98]We're good.
[157:46.64]Alright, come on, go.
[157:56.73]Where's the other one?
[157:58.49]Where are the other two cars?
[158:00.35]I don't like that at all.
[158:22.58]I don't like that.
[158:29.84]He's stuck!
[158:30.44]Yes!
[158:37.33]Yeah!
[158:40.23]Let's go.
[158:41.69]Hell yeah.
[158:43.01]That felt good.
[158:53.21]I didn't even get to take my drink!
[159:05.11]Ice cream trucks are the worst.
[159:12.27]I don't see a phone.
[159:17.06]There we go.
[159:25.03]Aw, dude!
[159:25.67]Can I please jump?
[159:26.69]Okay.

[159:48.88]Oh, great.
[159:52.87]Alright, is the cop car going... pulling him over?
[159:56.49]Or... it kind of looks like he's helping me.
[160:01.88]Oh, fuck!
[160:06.76]Is that a fire truck?
[160:10.50]Somebody saying help.
[160:15.32]I'm sorry dude, I gotta go.
[160:17.52]I'm sorry dude, I gotta get going.
[160:32.16]They're holding a party together.
[160:34.90]Alright, we got the tank, the DPS and the healer.
[160:43.33]They're not working well together.
[160:46.52]Oh shit.
[160:50.82]He's right up my ass.
[160:52.18]Okay.
[160:53.47]We're good.
[161:15.41]Lots of walls here I can use.
[161:22.10]I can't jump out.
[161:22.94]Yeah, that's come on.
[161:36.69]I'm guessing this way.
[161:39.84]Cut down here.
[161:42.56]Don't be a guy on a motorcycle, right?
[161:57.99]I'm safe back here.
[161:58.91]You can't hurt me.
[162:02.74]Can you explain the plot?
[162:05.90]I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
[162:08.67]What did I do?
[162:09.31]Am I going to pass out?
[162:41.70]you'll regret this open now okay let me take a break
[163:05.89]I'm going to get another drink and it will see how I'm doing.
[163:09.86]This one's great.
[163:10.38]I love this one a lot.
[163:11.16]We're going to keep playing this till the end.
[163:12.85]Or at least mostly to the end.
[163:15.55]I'll be right back in three or four minutes.
[163:19.52]This is a good one.
[163:20.00]I like this.
[163:20.46]I love this one.
[163:21.58]This is like.
[163:23.98]It's a good game.
[163:25.15]It's a good ass game.
[163:27.71]Baby.
[168:29.10]How we doing?
[168:37.65]They should make a sequel where you play as the car trying to hit the person.
[168:58.28]So what I've been doing, I've been adding, I've been diluting the cranberry juice because I don't want to drink like a whole container of cranberry juice.
[169:06.17]This is like number three.
[169:07.91]I've had three of these.
[169:09.62]And I looked at the container of cranberry juice and I'm like, I'm kind of drinking this whole thing.
[169:15.77]So we're doing like 30% cranberry juice, 70% water.
[169:20.27]How long was I out for?
[169:22.94]Are you diluting it with vodka?
[169:25.26]I mean the vodka is like a 10% dilution.
[169:27.67]Whatever, whatever, like one.
[169:29.13]I have one shot thing and I fill it up and I put it in the cup.
[169:38.60]Because OK, anytime you eyeball a drink.
[169:41.61]Good luck.
[169:43.61]Prepare prepare for a bad time.
[169:46.17]I think this is like 21 drink.
[169:50.06]No dude, I measure this shit now, especially since turning like 38.
[170:04.70]Oh, I didn't even... I did not even notice you.
[170:06.76]You just kind of snuck up on me.
[170:15.97]That is a huge truck though.
[170:17.27]I gotta go.
[170:28.46]Oh, by the way, I have an announcement to make.
[170:30.56]Big announcement to all of you retro gaming fans.
[170:33.76]I will be doing a full playthrough of Twinsen's Odyssey.
[170:37.78]And maybe even the first Twinsen game, Little Big Adventure.
[170:41.99]Coming up in the next week or two.
[170:48.00]Twinsen's Odyssey is one of my favorite games of all time.
[170:51.45]I've never actually played through the first one fully.
[170:55.19]Maybe we'll do them both.
[171:04.30]Holy shit, this one's fast.
[171:11.39]I think I lost him already.
[171:12.31]That was a great move.
[171:18.28]Alright, I gotta weave in here.
[171:21.68]Uh oh.
[171:23.34]Visions.

[171:43.05]No.
[171:50.75]Garbage truck.
[171:56.18]Alright, something weird is going to happen.
[171:57.46]Something crazy is going to happen right now.
[172:00.63]Yeah.

[172:04.25]You were right.
[172:05.39]Actually, no.
[172:05.71]What is it?
[172:07.03]It's like toxic waste.

[173:03.50]Are there boats?
[173:08.27]What is happening?
[173:09.33]Oh, it's back.
[173:22.69]Toxic waste?

[173:31.30]Alright, he's stuck.
[173:45.40]We're good.
[173:45.64]What the hell was that?
[173:52.16]It is a giant boat.

[175:20.57]Holy shit!
[175:21.83]I don't know how I didn't get hit by that.
[175:22.98]I got lucky.

[175:35.26]Holy jeez, that one was awful.
[175:47.70]Alright, go, go, I gotta go.
[175:55.16]I think they're just kind of throwing everything at me right now.
[176:11.17]I knew it.
[176:11.73]I knew there's gonna be another one right here.
[176:17.82]It's... You know it.
[176:19.75]I can't even talk.
[176:41.24]How?
[176:47.43]Are you gonna hold what?
[176:50.86]Are you kidding me, dude?
[176:53.66]You're the problem, not me, man.
[176:57.59]That was lucky.
[177:06.38]Where's the last phone down this way?
[177:07.72]Probably shit.
[177:12.41]Lose him in the train.
[177:13.73]Good, perfect go.
[177:20.44]Oh, it's bad.
[177:23.83]OK, I need to relax.
[177:31.38]It's so stressful though.
[177:32.76]I don't lose it here.
[177:41.27]I can feel them!
[177:57.85]I can feel them!
[178:04.90]I can feel them in the air.
[178:05.96]I can feel the air blowing against my...
[178:31.79]Oh, my God.
[179:48.64]Stop beeping you fucking dick.
[180:12.89]Alright, where's the phone?
[180:16.79]Where's the phone?
[180:17.45]Where's this one?
[180:18.01]Down this way?
[180:19.91]Down there?
[180:20.29]Oh shit!
[180:59.75]Where is it?
[181:02.80]Where is it?
[181:03.22]Where is it?
[181:03.60]Am I in the right spot?
[181:12.53]I don't see this thing anywhere.
[181:13.51]Where is it?
[181:20.47]Where am I?
[181:20.95]Where am I?
[181:23.92]I don't see a phone anywhere.
[181:30.57]Other side?
[181:45.34]I hear the phone.
[182:09.41]That was nuts.
[182:13.60]I can't, I'm so tired.
[182:20.31]Easy.
[182:21.01]Oh yeah.
[182:30.32]This song, Andrea listened to it all the time.
[182:40.92]This game has an endless mode?
[182:45.26]I don't know about that.
[182:49.55]That's right, there were two or three other little things to do, weren't there?
[182:57.90]I'll try.
[182:58.18]I'm curious about it.
[182:58.80]I'll try it.
[183:02.86]I had to do it.
[183:03.46]I had to get out of that damn basement.
[183:12.24]On my eyes.
[183:21.83]I don't like that sound where it is.
[183:39.15]Cutscene?
[183:40.68]I waited for Andrea to fall asleep.
[183:44.88]And then what?
[183:50.03]I blocked the door and grabbed the knife.
[183:54.09]And then what?
[184:02.04]Expose her wrist.
[184:09.44]After that, I remember Frank shooting through the basement door.
[184:29.14]I can't stop now.
[184:33.45]Final level?
[184:37.81]This looks like a final level to me.
[184:53.45]I've gotten so good at just baiting all the cards.
[184:56.98]Dude, this is... This is a skill-based game.
[185:16.91]Holy...
[185:29.08]Why the car so mad at you?
[185:31.34]I don't know this.
[185:33.22]Something in there.
[185:37.19]I think I'm safe.
[185:38.81]They've been running into each other the whole time.
[185:40.17]That's good.
[185:42.49]What are these blimps?
[185:53.91]I think I trapped him pretty well.
[186:23.18]It's the horn that's killing me right now.
[186:32.19]Did you high?
[186:36.33]No, I I'm very visibly drinking vodka cranberries for the last four and a half hours.
[186:47.49]Dude, that guy is aggressive.
[186:55.29]Alright, this is a reset.
[186:56.93]This is a reset.
[187:03.50]It's a reset.
[187:09.01]My face is itchy.
[187:09.69]It's a reset.
[187:16.14]I went the wrong way.
[187:16.74]It's a reset.
[187:19.57]You've had eight vodka cranberries?
[187:21.18]No, dude, don't... Get that fake news out of here.
[187:24.62]I've had four.
[187:37.29]Fake news?
[187:37.99]What?
[187:40.40]I have not had eight vodka... I would... I would not be alright right now if I had eight.
[187:45.84]That's a number... I ain't going that high.
[188:00.67]How's the hair?
[188:11.20]Look at that.
[188:15.26]Trapped.
[188:19.85]Do you know who I want to see play this game?
[188:23.51]Ster.

[191:28.02]You gotta check this one out.
[191:28.78]This one's good.
[191:31.10]It's called decimate drive.
[191:38.49]Don't watch the stream anymore.
[191:39.97]Get off.
[191:40.35]We gotta see a full Ster playthrough.
[191:45.25]And yes, I've had nine vodka pineapples.
[192:02.03]Fucked it up.
[192:03.84]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[192:04.64]Ster said what?
[192:07.22]Ster said he's already on the leaderboard for endless mode.
[192:09.46]That's not, that's, that's, that's made up.
[192:17.37]Frank.
[192:32.88]Think that's Frank.
[192:34.56]That truck, it trapped Frank in a tunnel.
[192:36.32]Why is it moving?
[192:37.00]Is it waiting for something?
[192:40.63]Yeah, me.
[192:44.53]Hey, you should do steroids and get big.
[192:45.81]You used to be jacked.
[192:48.57]All natural.
[192:50.57]Don't do any of that shit.
[192:51.55]What are you, fucking nuts?
[192:53.58]He deserves it.
[192:54.18]Maybe it should be me.
[193:00.69]No blood on this truck yet.
[193:02.17]Approach the truck to get in.
[193:08.36]What?
[193:12.48]Dude, are we actually driving the car?
[193:31.06]Do I have to... Do I kill... Is that what the person said in the chat like an hour ago?
[193:52.06]Did I beat it?
[193:58.87]New game plus mode and level selection unlocked.
[194:04.00]So I killed Frank with my car.
[194:14.57]OK, I'm I'm very curious.
[194:15.81]This one was really cool.
[194:16.77]I like it.
[194:18.71]Should I try the one of the other ones?
[194:24.01]This is high score.
[194:25.38]Stay ahead of killer cars in the clock.
[194:30.06]I'm curious.
[194:30.70]Let's try this one.
[194:35.64]17 seconds.
[194:39.57]Oh, I get it.
[194:45.42]Intermission?
[194:56.79]Oh, you gotta collect all the green stuff.
[195:00.75]It probably gets increasingly harder.
[195:03.88]My hearing aid.
[195:07.54]Should I pick up the, uh, red is good too?
[195:09.42]Okay.
[195:20.38]Sounds like Pac-Man.
[195:39.40]Jesus, I heard him.
[195:43.16]Okay, well I got 162 points.
[195:44.08]That's good.
[195:48.79]Should I do the other one or should I do in the next game?
[195:51.37]What do you guys think?
[195:54.74]Should we have a chat vote?
[195:58.00]Should I do the back roads or move on?
[196:03.17]This was great though.
[196:04.15]This is a wonderful game.
[196:07.75]Next?
[196:08.15]Okay.
[196:09.91]That was Decimate Drive.
[196:17.34]I think that was a great one.
[196:19.07]That was wonderful.
[196:21.09]Moving on in.
[196:24.15]Quick time frame here.
[196:25.53]Let's go to... Alright, this one.
[196:28.87]This one could be great or could be not great.
[196:32.66]I don't know.
[196:35.44]I just saw this on the horror tag and I said, okay, I'm just going to get it.
[196:39.85]I have no idea.
[196:41.31]Completely blind to anything that's in it.
[196:42.75]This is called Horror Globes.
[196:45.50]Horror Globes.
[196:47.62]I don't know.
[196:49.30]This could be a banger or who has any idea.
[197:00.88]This game contains a few screamers, some blood, guts, and candies.
[197:04.47]Have fun.
[197:05.37]Okay.
[197:11.72]It's an interesting way to put it.
[197:19.81]Oh, you guys can't see it.
[197:22.43]There we go.
[197:23.73]English, Deutsch, or Espanol?
[197:27.70]Espanol?
[197:28.34]Did I just actually say it like that?
[197:31.63]Are you kidding me?
[197:34.45]Well, this is serious.
[197:35.16]I have to hurry.
[197:37.32]I have a couple of hours before she returns.
[197:40.56]It's time to find the secret of her homemade treats.
[197:45.79]Spaniel!
[197:47.08]Hey, can I get some jalapeños with that fucking burrito I ordered, too?
[198:00.66]Okay, closed.
[198:02.12]I know she hides a copy of the key around here.
[198:06.00]Find the key.
[198:10.88]But I first tried the key.
[198:12.09]I'm just letting you know.
[198:15.03]Spaniel!
[198:17.25]God damn it.
[198:19.81]Okay.
[198:20.51]Treats.
[198:20.93]I need 13 treats.
[198:22.23]I got a key.
[198:27.68]How's the volume?
[198:28.20]Volume alright?
[198:28.84]Should I turn it up?
[198:32.53]Enter the property.
[198:37.98]Still locked.
[198:38.64]Oh, how do I use the key?
[198:46.43]OK.
[198:46.51]We're going to turn it back down.
[198:48.55]To where it was.
[198:50.61]Everyone is suspicious of everyone since what happened this summer.
[198:52.90]They have only opened a few doors for me tonight.
[199:01.71]This one seems pretty high quality.
[199:06.18]Private property keep out.
[199:12.20]Smells disgusting.
[199:13.08]I'm not going to open that.
[199:30.04]I love the color in this one.
[199:31.12]The color is wonderful.
[199:32.91]I love that, like, the aura.
[199:33.85]This is well designed.
[199:38.49]He's one of the children who vanished this summer.
[199:41.42]Still nothing is known about them.
[199:42.48]That's why this whole mess has been formed.
[199:46.95]Look at that trail.
[199:48.49]I'm just saying, look at that trail.
[199:50.73]That eye line of going into the middle and into the top here of the moon.
[199:57.20]This is some cinematographer design.
[199:59.41]Just saying.
[200:12.75]The orange with the gray?
[200:16.36]Somebody knows what they're doing.
[200:27.35]Let's go right.
[200:34.96]Yeah, why am I rating this like it's a house slipper entrant?
[200:39.65]I gotta tell you, the curbside is wonderful.
[200:42.37]Yeah.
[200:49.05]Locked.
[200:50.41]Padlock looks very resistant, OK?
[201:06.91]I love the light in this one.
[201:08.35]Am I crazy or is it?
[201:30.78]Okay.
[201:32.97]Is this the house?
[201:47.48]She's not home.
[201:50.24]Okay.
[201:55.61]There's gotta be a window I can go through, right?
[201:57.51]Side door?
[202:16.26]Those four children faces are everywhere.
[202:23.39]Window?
[202:28.32]Uh, I just found a treat.
[202:32.09]One of 13.
[202:32.63]Is this a house?
[202:35.39]A cabin?
[202:36.01]A well?
[202:37.18]A cave?
[202:40.70]This ain't a granny like, right?
[202:55.83]Okay, let's check this out.
[203:07.67]What the fuck is that?
[203:12.24]Seems too small for that amount of wood.
[203:14.68]I'll take it just in case.
[203:16.88]I think it's a granny leg.
[203:25.13]I just saved the game.
[203:33.04]Many chemicals?
[203:36.86]Can I equip this?
[203:38.69]Alright, I got the axe equipped.
[203:41.73]Nah.
[203:48.96]I appreciate the nah.
[203:51.10]Nah.
[203:51.72]Nah.
[203:52.31]Nah.
[203:53.95]Okay, an old scythe?
[203:56.43]I can't touch it.
[204:07.79]Oh, hold on.
[204:08.92]Start.
[204:10.24]Hold, what does it say?
[204:11.74]Hold for three seconds.
[204:15.15]Nothing happened.
[204:20.17]Something is missing.
[204:21.94]I need a part or something like a battery.
[204:24.38]I think it is.
[204:24.90]I think it's a granny like guys.
[204:29.79]It's a granny like.
[204:32.09]But I will say.
[204:34.63]It's a very.
[204:37.10]It's a very pretty granny like it's a very beautiful game.
[204:39.88]This is actually wonderful looking.
[204:46.95]OK.
[204:47.21]So let's go to the well or the garden.
[204:50.32]I have one try any 13 treats.
[205:01.44]I've won.
[205:22.63]Okay, where am I going here?
[205:33.19]Yep, keep out, private property.
[205:35.03]Alright, so... Where should I go?
[205:41.18]I went through here already.
[205:54.57]I can't get in the house.
[205:57.60]What did I pick up?
[205:58.18]I picked up... I have an axe.
[205:59.71]Can I use the axe to chop something down?
[206:01.03]It's a quaint autumn evening, yeah?
[206:23.08]Maybe I'll try the house again?
[206:25.16]Where's this garden?
[206:28.79]What is this?
[206:31.43]What is this thing?
[206:46.11]Can I like pry open one of the doors or something?
[206:47.92]Or windows?
[206:52.42]You showing no mercy to the granny-like community?
[206:57.03]Nah, dude, it's alright.
[206:58.13]If you like granny-likes, that's on you.
[207:02.13]Why am I making that seem like a bad thing?
[207:04.17]Hey, well, that's on you if you like granny-likes, not me.
[207:07.44]It will not open.
[207:19.01]What I meant to say was, if you like granny-likes, that's fine.
[207:24.91]I need the key to the door.
[207:27.99]I ain't leaving this one.
[207:29.59]I think this one's good.
[207:31.53]I gotta think.
[207:32.47]Okay, house.
[207:34.10]There's a little shack.
[207:35.74]What about this little cave down here?
[207:38.40]There's a well?
[207:40.40]Alright, let's go to the cave.
[207:48.65]He's on his 16th vodka cranberry.
[207:51.46]We're not talking about that right now.
[207:55.43]Alright, looking for a cave.
[207:58.42]Because the house is right here, which means the cave should be right here somewhere, right?
[208:02.56]Technically.
[208:07.31]Where's the cave?
[208:12.65]Cave.
[208:15.40]Anybody see a cave?
[208:17.70]That's not a cave.
[208:20.80]Maybe it is.
[208:22.59]Can I smash this up?
[208:26.94]No.
[208:27.80]OK.
[208:31.48]Are you drinking pineapple schnapps?
[208:43.73]I feel like that we kind of good though.
[208:48.70]It's funny, I drink like.
[208:51.08]Maybe six or seven times a year.
[208:55.44]I have alcohol in my pantry that is untouched for years.
[208:59.15]That means it gets better, right?
[209:04.06]This year there will be no trick-or-treating due to the disappearances.
[209:08.91]One of the children who vanished.
[209:09.99]Okay.
[209:11.27]Nothing's known about them.
[209:11.93]That's why this... Okay.
[209:15.16]Where's this key?
[209:26.93]I can't just go in the trash or something.
[209:28.49]Here's the OK met the entrance.
[209:35.68]Did I miss a key or something that I could have grabbed?
[209:41.57]Back at the entrance here.
[209:42.43]I feel like I missed something, right?
[209:49.73]I don't know.
[209:51.72]I don't know where it is.
[209:55.14]Go to the well.
[209:57.98]If I go left, can I just, like, kind of drop into the well?
[210:00.56]I... I guess I can go this way.
[210:12.00]Oh, oh no.
[210:13.12]I may have caused a problem here.
[210:17.57]Okay, well, I guess I could jump up this way, I guess.
[210:30.55]Oh shit, here we go.
[210:38.60]One of those weird keys, like the one I found last night.
[210:41.56]Oh!
[210:43.98]Dude, really?
[210:48.15]Are you kidding me?
[210:51.05]I can't pull it.
[210:51.61]It's stuck on something.
[210:52.35]Maybe I can cut it.
[210:54.84]Rubber gloves.
[210:59.00]I got an axe, right?
[211:01.83]I have to turn the water pump and see where the pipe ends before I cut the rope.
[211:08.06]I can't move it.
[211:08.60]It's stuck.
[211:17.45]Pipe for pumping water from the well.
[211:18.53]It seems to be off or not working.
[211:19.99]So I can't cut this?
[211:28.16]I can't pull it.
[211:28.74]It's stuck with something.
[211:29.38]Maybe I can cut it.
[211:30.24]Yeah, but what... Wait, what?
[211:33.12]I have to turn the water pump... turn on the water pump and see where the pipe ends.
[211:39.93]Alright, so I gotta turn the water on?
[211:41.39]How the hell do I do that?
[211:56.68]Fix the power switch first?
[212:02.85]Where are the cars?
[212:03.92]I don't think there are cars in this game.
[212:11.45]Well, I have a glove now.
[212:14.15]What can I do with the glove?
[212:19.44]Oh, hold on.
[212:20.94]Must be where she grows her pumpkins, although the town is dominated by sugar beets.
[212:24.91]Can I, like, dig through this?
[212:27.08]That doesn't go there.
[212:28.12]Shit.
[212:38.51]I don't see anything here.
[212:41.76]Anybody see anything?
[212:42.70]Maybe pick up the acid with the gloves?
[212:51.11]Pick up the chemicals with the gloves on.
[212:53.22]No.
[212:55.12]Pick up the side with the gloves.
[212:57.56]That doesn't go there.
[213:08.48]I can repair this, but... Suitable for water-filled motor.
[213:13.53]This is a pump?
[213:16.39]How do I turn it on?
[213:21.82]Okay, I need a battery.
[213:31.15]I need a fuse.
[213:35.68]Anybody know where a fuse is?
[213:39.33]I feel like we explored most of the game.
[213:42.41]Unless I missed on the ground somewhere.
[213:43.69]Did I miss it somewhere?
[213:48.36]I'm seeing I'm seeing no help.
[213:54.56]I did the well.
[213:55.33]I did the forest.
[213:56.31]I did the maybe into the garden.
[213:58.03]Let me go to the garden.
[213:59.59]Because the garden should be technically right here, right?
[214:01.77]This is the garden.
[214:11.19]Around the back.
[214:13.03]Oh, watch this dude.
[214:15.05]It's gonna be right here.
[214:17.18]Oh, check this out.
[214:20.76]Got it.
[214:26.71]Shit.
[214:34.29]The Horror Globe fan base.
[214:36.13]Alright.
[214:39.41]No more vodka cranberries for the rest of the night.
[214:42.34]No more vodka cranberries.
[214:43.30]I'm done.
[214:44.16]We're not eating.
[214:44.68]We're not having any more vodka cranberries.
[214:49.76]That's the last one.
[215:01.16]Somebody said we?
[215:01.94]What are you talking about?
[215:03.94]Use for the glove.
[215:08.49]I need a fuse.
[215:13.93]Trash can gloves that makes sense to me.
[215:20.24]At the game just shook.
[215:25.41]Gloves with the trash.
[215:47.04]I feel like I could follow the Jack-o'-lanterns the whole time.
[215:55.63]I need to turn the pump on, but I can't turn the pump on.
[216:02.67]I need to find where the water is.
[216:11.16]Let me try this.
[216:15.08]Damn it, really?
[216:17.82]There's a house I can go in somewhere, apparently.
[216:23.89]I need a key to get in the house.
[216:38.33]Why is this kid doing all this?
[216:39.35]Just go home?
[216:42.73]I don't know why we're even here in the game.
[216:44.76]That's true.
[216:49.68]Hey, dude, there's a vodka cranberry shortage because of you.
[216:54.22]Okay, well, sorry I had four.
[216:57.03]I tanked the entire vodka cranberry economy, apparently.
[217:04.96]I bought one container of vodka and one container of cranberry juice.
[217:09.74]I'm sorry I've ruined everything, okay?
[217:11.97]You walked past the pipe already?
[217:15.13]Did I?
[217:24.12]I'm not leaving this one yet.
[217:26.04]I'm not leaving it.
[217:30.13]Oh shit, there it is.
[217:34.40]Well, it's just a pipe that goes into the ground.
[217:36.18]Can I not do anything with it?
[217:37.42]OK, well, I found the source of the water, but what am I?
[217:43.50]How do I use it?
[217:53.20]I got it.
[217:54.92]Is there not a threat in this game?
[218:01.10]Why does every game have to have a threat in every game?
[218:34.54]Okay.
[218:40.13]Put the key under the... Whatever.
[218:45.75]I've been months since I experienced it.
[218:47.44]I thought I was gone, but I think this is... Okay, whatever.
[218:50.36]Something is wrong.
[218:51.42]She has never been so violent.
[218:52.76]I should be careful when I'm out... Who is this kid?
[218:54.58]If I am not near a refuge when I notice its presence, I can turn off the flashlight and crouch to try to calm down.
[219:02.17]Who is this person?
[219:18.62]Okay, I can get in the house now at least.
[219:30.43]What the hell are you doing?
[219:31.67]That chimney has always scared me.
[219:33.27]It is said that it... smoke draws the faces of the people who are going to die.
[219:40.08]I even thought I saw mine once.
[219:46.25]Okay.
[219:54.12]Alright, I got the key now.
[219:55.12]Let's go.
[219:55.51]It works.
[219:59.98]The door is open.
[220:02.85]Dude, we're in.
[220:17.31]Look at this occultist shit on the ground.
[220:20.19]I've seen this drawing before.
[220:22.53]In the town, they relate it to secret witches' meetings.
[220:26.78]They scare us by telling us how they gorge themselves on child's flesh and human blood.
[220:30.93]That's fucked up.
[220:32.15]Stories to keep us from sneaking out from home.
[220:38.46]Forgotten arcane arts.
[220:42.02]Bones, marrow, okay.
[220:50.69]Junk.
[220:54.51]Junk.
[220:57.18]Candy.
[220:58.68]That's two candies, by the way.
[221:01.14]For safety reasons, a curfew is decreed from 6 p.m.
[221:06.07]This summer, four children disappeared after the last one measures were taken.
[221:11.21]But I was not going to stay home on Halloween night.
[221:14.66]I've been thinking about this for 16 weeks now.
[221:16.78]That's very specific for a kid to know that.
[221:19.66]I was looking forward to continuing my nightly excursions.
[221:24.09]I was also a very well-spoken child.
[221:31.22]I'm not sure I've heard the word excursions from a little kid before.
[221:41.62]It's not plugged in.
[221:42.58]I don't think it works.
[221:43.38]It's too old.
[221:47.34]That's fucking scary.
[221:49.28]Because I don't think that's what the painting was before.
[221:58.61]It's locked.
[221:59.57]I don't see any locks.
[222:00.29]There must be some way to open it.
[222:01.56]I should look around.
[222:14.80]Fireplace?
[222:27.58]You've had too many health potions.
[222:28.76]I'm doing just fine.
[222:31.01]Axe.
[222:32.37]No.
[222:33.23]Glove.
[222:35.53]Weird key.
[222:37.85]I don't know what I'm doing.
[222:38.99]Okay, glove.
[222:40.72]No.
[222:47.80]So how do I get this open?
[222:55.37]Shit.
[222:57.87]Hey, will you sign a bush light for me?
[223:00.26]No.
[223:02.86]Potions and spells.
[223:05.00]There's got to be something in this room.
[223:11.65]What's that?
[223:12.47]Warning.
[223:17.34]Small wooden table.
[223:28.11]Nah, you'll sell it.
[223:29.42]You'll sell it.
[223:31.48]Nah, you'll sell it.
[223:35.68]Oh, well, I can open the windows now.
[223:40.23]The Rock Rose Lighthouse.
[223:47.22]Okay.
[223:56.75]I don't think I can open any of these doors.
[224:00.64]What about this way?
[224:04.24]Is that the only door?
[224:07.89]Well shit, I can't do anything in here.
[224:10.83]Alright, I'm taking a break.
[224:13.79]Has an hour gone by already?
[224:15.23]Damn.
[224:20.06]I'll see you guys in three minutes.
[224:22.52]And we'll keep going.
[224:24.69]Dude, are you drunk?
[224:26.21]I'd say I'm probably like a 4 out of 10 on that scale.
[224:33.70]Okay, when we first walked in, I was fine.
[224:35.76]But once we got to the... Once we got to the power box, I was like, oh shit.
[224:40.35]This actually kind of hit me pretty hard.
[224:41.77]So I'll be back.
[224:47.58]And we'll keep playing.
[224:49.84]I got to the power box and I opened it and I was like, oh wait, I'm good to go.
[224:53.75]No, actually, it's kind of hitting me.
[224:56.66]So, see you in a minute.
[229:05.75]How's it going?
[229:06.63]We have like two minutes left in the ad.
[229:09.37]Did it just start like a minute ago?
[229:11.18]Am I crazy?
[229:18.57]What time is it?
[229:27.54]Ads just finished.
[229:28.58]Did they?
[229:31.19]Dude, my computer's CMOS battery.
[229:34.03]It's all good.
[229:36.78]I'll get it handled.
[229:39.28]How healthy is your urinary tract with all the cranberry?
[229:42.61]I've got healthy piss, don't worry.
[229:54.92]Yeah, don't worry about me.
[229:55.68]We're good.
[229:57.96]Alright.
[229:58.90]Let's go.
[229:59.32]By the way, I know the solution.
[230:05.67]Because...
[230:10.13]You'll see.
[230:21.74]How do I move the table?
[230:27.13]Did you look it up?
[230:28.73]Walk through Andy?
[230:29.39]Yep.
[230:32.22]Small wooden table.
[230:35.96]Oh, what's that?
[230:36.84]There's a lonely book up there, but I can't reach it.
[230:39.07]I'll take a closer look.
[230:42.89]How did I know how to do that?
[230:44.09]I must have figured it out.
[230:45.62]My brain must be fucking 10,000 fucking gigahertz.
[230:52.18]Secrets of Witchcraft.
[230:56.97]Dude, the door just opened.
[231:04.44]Blood.

[231:22.80]Ugh.
[231:22.90]Okay.
[231:24.52]Dude, Granny, do the dishes.
[231:27.52]This is ridiculous.
[231:28.17]I mean, that's ridiculous.
[231:29.93]Come on, Granny.
[231:32.39]If you have to lean a plate on another plate, it's time to do the dishes.
[231:42.91]Once you justify leaning and... Oh, no, no, no.
[231:45.43]It's okay.
[231:46.07]I can fit it in there if I go like this.
[231:48.23]When you start playing Tetris with your plates, just do them.
[231:54.58]What is it going on here?
[231:57.36]Talks about the use of bone dust in ancient medicine.
[231:59.80]The more torture the subject is at the time of death, the greater the effectiveness.
[232:05.37]The best way to do this was to use the bones of young prisoners who've been sentenced to death and recently executed.
[232:24.28]Granny, what the fuck are you doing?
[232:25.52]More plates, Granny.
[232:27.49]Ridiculous.
[232:30.27]On Halloween night, the barrier between the living and the dead is broken.
[232:33.78]The lifeless comes to life and claims what it considers its own.
[232:38.99]When the night of Halloween falls on a full moon, witches celebrate feasts of flesh and blood.
[232:45.02]These meetings usually last for days and are accompanied by rituals and sacrifices.
[232:55.08]What if I happen to just fucking squatting up and playing Call of Duty?
[232:57.66]You know what I mean?
[233:00.75]Create, feed, master your homunculus.
[233:14.86]It's an elevator?
[233:16.94]Does not work.
[233:18.16]There's some kind of hole.
[233:19.08]Oh, wait.
[233:20.97]I have to turn this on to get upstairs.
[233:23.17]Don't I have a thing that I can stick in there?
[233:26.45]This thing's weird, right?
[233:27.77]No.
[233:29.60]Looks like the same type, but it doesn't fit.
[233:39.85]Okay.
[233:41.27]Automod got this, but I thought somebody just asked me why I have a butt chug emote.
[233:45.52]And I was about to say, bro, what are you talking about?
[233:49.48]Um, but that's not what they said.
[233:54.53]It was something completely different.
[233:58.49]I'm not going to put my hand in there without a reason.
[234:00.96]Wait, can I put the glove on, right?
[234:07.34]Like, why would you?
[234:08.33]Why would you have a butt-chuggy emote?
[234:10.93]Even if, you know what I'm saying?
[234:11.97]Like, who would ever do that?
[234:14.45]There's no purpose for that.
[234:29.65]That's like the quickest way to get banned on Twitch, too, by the way.
[234:32.63]Oh, yeah, man, bro.
[234:34.28]Hey, uh, terp, uh, lowercase j, terp of buttchop, dude.
[234:39.63]You trying to get me fucking deleted from this website?
[234:48.18]Okay, so what do I do?
[235:06.23]Yeah, it says I don't have a reason to touch that if I try to grab the meat under the body.
[235:11.72]A bucket full of viscera.
[235:16.93]OK, but I can't pick it up.
[235:17.95]OK, here we go.
[235:19.05]I'm not going to put my hand in there without a reason.
[235:22.42]But what's the reason?
[235:25.34]The reason is there's probably something in there.
[235:39.04]FAQ Freddy trying to cheat.
[235:40.86]I just want to see the monster, okay?
[235:53.00]Don't cut your hair.
[235:53.82]I'll be devastated.
[235:54.72]Well, it's not your hair, so you'll be fine.
[236:02.02]I can pick up something, right?
[236:08.11]There should be a moldy pizza.
[236:09.56]One of my mods is saying.
[236:10.44]Yeah, my mods got the walkthroughs already open.
[236:12.16]Don't worry.
[236:13.04]They're already on it.
[236:22.40]They said look for the moldy pizza.
[236:34.51]I thought this was closed, okay?
[236:37.03]That's a pretty moldy fucking pizza.
[236:38.83]I thought these were closed.
[236:42.78]Okay, so there's the photo.
[236:48.70]Alright, hey, imagine taking this picture.
[236:53.69]Bro, remember we used to just load up Call of Duty and play fucking zombies?
[236:57.86]What are people doing?
[237:11.17]Oh.
[237:14.08]Yuck, here it is.
[237:14.86]I think I'll leave the glove over here.
[237:16.90]What is it?
[237:17.24]Oh, alright, let's go.
[237:29.38]Oh man, OK.
[237:31.60]Alright, so this should go in here now.
[237:32.84]It works.
[237:40.35]That's an angry eye.
[237:48.71]Don't turn the light off.
[237:58.02]Somebody in the door.
[237:59.41]Somebody's right there.
[238:23.30]Wait, why did you say mmm?
[238:28.05]Touch the false windows this way.
[238:30.93]A boat where you sleep.
[238:32.87]A chimney where you cook.
[238:35.12]A dragon tree where you feed.
[238:37.90]A volcano at the entrance.
[238:40.12]A car where you warm up.
[238:42.59]That is all.
[238:43.87]I take the note with me to review it.
[238:54.70]We just found the fuse.
[239:05.92]We just found the fuse, guys.
[239:14.79]There are baby clothes and several medical uniforms.
[239:17.19]Okay.
[239:18.67]The town said that she was never able to have children.
[239:22.20]Of course, they also say she's over 100 years old.
[239:25.85]And these are locked.
[239:31.72]Well, I have the fuse now.
[239:42.18]Recipe for creating a powerful homemade corrosive.
[239:46.32]Several chemicals are mixed in a small amount of causes damage almost any material, even metal.
[239:53.51]I got way too many of these paintings in your house.
[239:56.76]Why do you have all these?
[240:00.24]That's like the 15th eyeball painting.
[240:08.33]Okay.
[240:09.75]Well, I can power it.
[240:10.69]Wait, what is this?
[240:14.22]I didn't do that.
[240:17.46]That was actually terrifying.
[240:20.21]Okay.
[240:25.00]Artists draw a bajillion of these for practice.
[240:30.21]Really?
[240:30.55]That's interesting.
[240:40.41]Okay, let's put the fuse in.
[240:51.48]What's that?
[240:52.58]Found a treat.
[240:54.14]That's treat 3 out of 13.
[241:00.03]Treat?
[241:00.87]No.
[241:04.57]What was that?
[241:04.87]Ah!
[241:14.56]Oh, it's just the person in the bag.
[241:15.78]Never mind.
[241:16.24]We're fine.
[241:29.95]The eye wasn't angry before.
[241:31.47]Now it is.
[241:31.84]Alright, let's put the fuse in.
[241:40.05]And then turn on the pump.
[241:41.97]Slash the thing, the rope.
[241:45.13]And we'll be going good.
[241:55.89]How you guys doing?
[241:56.95]It's getting kind of late for a lot of you guys, aren't you?
[241:59.84]We're good, though.
[242:06.49]Fuse is in.
[242:07.05]I think I can turn it on now.
[242:09.11]Good.
[242:09.55]Alright.
[242:09.83]Let's turn the pump on.
[242:16.72]Okay.
[242:20.05]Pump is on.
[242:22.13]Save the game.
[242:22.73]I still can't get the scythe down.
[242:30.52]Now let's go pump it up.
[242:33.10]It's 3 p.m.
[242:34.06]here?
[242:36.58]Where is here, I wonder?
[242:45.89]Australia.
[242:54.28]Okay, I can't pull it stuck on something.
[242:55.52]Maybe I can cut it.
[242:56.82]Okay, let's cut it.
[242:59.81]I want to know where the pipe ends before I cut the rope.
[243:04.44]What are you talking about?
[243:06.40]I want to know where the pipe ends before I cut the rope.
[243:10.41]Why do you want to know that?
[243:22.35]Who cares?
[243:22.87]Just cut it.
[243:26.95]Uh, I think you need to open specific windows downstairs.
[243:31.65]Paintings downstairs.
[243:32.86]Puzzle describes various paintings downstairs.
[243:38.56]You know, I really am just getting sick and tired of them putting this on fucking stuff for all the dumb people to know where to go.
[243:50.62]But thank you for putting that there, though.
[243:51.96]I would not have been able to find this without it if it wasn't there.
[244:03.85]Uh, paintings downstairs.
[244:05.39]Okay.
[244:17.69]Why are you so mean?
[244:18.57]I... It was a joke.
[244:26.39]Oh, there's alcohol in that.
[244:29.41]Disgusting.
[244:36.83]Alright, paintings downstairs.
[244:39.11]Let's see.
[244:43.46]Somebody said, you're a joke.
[244:49.72]Hey, why don't you relax?
[244:51.10]Alright.
[244:51.88]Paintings downstairs.
[245:03.96]So I have to open certain windows down here?
[245:06.59]I never would have figured this out.
[245:08.79]In a million years, no way.
[245:12.40]What do I do?
[245:15.72]What do I do?
[245:16.10]What do I do?
[245:16.53]What do I do?
[245:16.95]What do I do?
[245:17.53]What do I do?
[245:35.64]Okay, just the paintings.
[245:57.05]Paintings though, I haven't been following too many paintings though.
[245:59.55]Got it.
[246:00.94]Okay.
[246:03.95]Hey, I haven't watched your stream in like two years.
[246:05.80]I dig the long hair.
[246:07.08]Hey, thanks.
[246:08.48]Welcome back.
[246:11.07]To be fair, I haven't really streamed that much in the last two years until about six months ago.
[246:15.63]So I streamed like 15 times in 2024.
[246:22.21]So yeah, welcome back.
[246:35.14]What should I do?
[246:39.22]I like your hair.
[246:39.68]I like every stream.
[246:40.92]Hey, thanks.
[246:44.29]I like your hair and I like every stream.
[246:48.23]You started streaming more since you retired?
[246:51.32]I think I kind of just decided I was going to do it if I felt like it.
[246:55.04]And if I was going to have fun with it.
[246:57.94]And that's exactly what I'm doing.
[247:01.19]Wait, what's that?
[247:03.27]Stories from Salem.
[247:10.24]Where are you reading these fake chatters?
[247:13.84]I have a fake chatter bot thing that I look over and it gives me like affirmational words.
[247:19.11]It's right here.
[247:19.93]It's not connected to anything.
[247:20.85]It's just like right here.
[247:22.50]I have two chats.
[247:23.28]I have this one.
[247:23.70]This is a real one.
[247:24.70]And I have a fake one over here.
[247:25.78]And every, I want to say every like 10 to 15 minutes, a fake user is here.
[247:31.72]Um, and it says, like, hey, dude, like, love the streams.
[247:33.78]And I go, oh, thanks, man.
[247:35.10]I just, like, kind of keep it there just to make, to, you know, give myself some, like, affirmation.
[247:39.63]Um, it's not connected anywhere.
[247:41.49]It's not public or anything.
[247:42.61]It's just my own thing.
[247:45.54]Like, hey, dude, like, really, like, keep it up.
[247:47.50]You're doing really good in this game.
[247:48.58]And I'm like, oh, thanks, man.
[248:05.20]Um, do I need to do anything else here?
[248:08.28]Do I have everything I need?
[248:10.65]It says explore the house still.
[248:17.72]Why are they always negative?
[248:19.71]Well, sometimes it has to be negative.
[248:22.56]Sometimes I have a thing up there that's like, you know, it's like, oh, hey, I love the streams.
[248:26.07]Really cool, dude.
[248:27.09]But then one will pop up and it says, hey, dude, I can't believe that this stream is still going.
[248:34.70]It's shocking that people still watch this channel because you're a dog shit.
[248:38.58]And I just I get pissed off at it.
[248:39.76]But I go, you know what?
[248:40.32]Like, you know, OK, fine.
[248:42.24]You can have that opinion, dickhead.
[248:46.03]It's not real, though.
[248:46.81]I just I made it up.
[248:47.71]It's like a thing that's over here.
[248:50.37]Because it can't be too positive.
[248:54.25]Um, where'd I go?
[248:56.82]I don't know where to go.
[249:03.85]Is that where the butt chug chatter came from?
[249:05.85]Uh... Wait!
[249:14.38]She's hiding something in the basement.
[249:22.13]Find the basement entrance.
[249:25.46]I did it.
[249:35.01]Basement entrance.
[249:38.58]Hey, is butt chugging an American thing?
[249:41.02]Butt chugging is a thing that you should not ever say again.
[249:45.25]Any of you.
[249:48.95]Ah, period.
[249:49.89]We should just not bring it up anymore.
[249:51.41]So, we should just kind of move on.
[249:52.51]So... I don't think it's American.
[249:55.37]I think it's just kind of... Like, weird guy at the party or something.
[250:01.86]You know what I mean?
[250:02.30]Like, this is like... I don't think it's universally just strange.
[250:06.09]So, we're just not going to... We're just going to move on.
[250:09.23]Hey, it's patriotic.
[250:12.23]Okay.
[250:13.35]I'm done with this conversation.
[250:14.60]We're going to continue.
[250:15.78]I've got to find the basement entrance.
[250:22.21]I think it's the firefly.
[250:30.83]I can't get over the it's patriotic comment.
[250:37.80]It's killing me.
[250:42.73]I just see, like, fireworks.
[250:44.87]Like... Hey, alright, man!
[250:48.91]Hey, happy 4th of July!
[250:50.80]Okay.
[250:53.36]Let's go ahead and put the lights out.
[250:56.58]That ain't patriotic.
[250:57.71]That's just... It's fucking strange.
[251:01.81]It's like, here comes the finale of the fireworks!
[251:03.71]Oh, and of course, the butt chug!
[251:09.72]Um... I got the basement quest, yeah.
[251:20.68]I'll tell you, if I go to a party and somebody butt chugs, I'm gone.
[251:24.40]I am leaving.
[251:25.39]I am out of there.
[251:26.07]I am literally Homer Simpson-ing out.
[251:28.41]And I'm gone.
[251:29.05]Forever.
[251:30.45]And I ain't rep- I'm not gonna reply to your texts.
[251:34.10]I'm just gone.
[251:34.60]I'm gone.
[251:35.24]We're done.
[251:38.80]Gotta do the paintings to unlock the basement.
[251:47.07]What's the basement puzzle?
[251:49.80]Yeah, combine two words.
[251:50.98]Get over it.
[252:05.02]Uh, I gotta read the note?
[252:11.53]What does it say?
[252:15.35]Touch the false windows this way.
[252:17.84]A boat where you sleep.
[252:20.90]The false windows.
[252:22.58]Okay, a boat where you sleep, a chimney where you cook.
[252:26.10]Boat where you sleep.
[252:29.15]Touch the false windows.
[252:33.77]I gotta go up to the bed and touch a window?
[252:39.30]Hey, can you play the number factory game?
[252:41.84]Uh, maybe not.
[252:49.76]Hey, can you do a toxic streamer bit?
[252:54.05]It's like 10.30.
[252:55.85]It's like 2 o'clock in the morning for some of you.
[252:59.78]Let's just chill.
[253:00.72]Okay, touch the false windows.
[253:05.46]Like that?
[253:05.91]It means the paintings.
[253:16.30]Touch the false window.
[253:20.71]Oh shit.
[253:23.27]Something clicked.
[253:30.24]A chimney where you cook.
[253:32.04]Let's go.
[253:32.46]We're cooking now.
[253:42.16]Are you pretending?
[253:44.40]No dude, sorry.
[253:44.96]I didn't know that there was a tiny button on the painting.
[253:50.50]Chimney where you cook.
[253:52.40]Let's go to the kitchen.
[254:01.45]Chimney?
[254:08.10]Okay.
[254:11.65]Boat where you sleep.
[254:12.59]Chimney where you cook.
[254:13.57]Dragon tree where you feed.
[254:22.93]Is this a dragon tree where you feed?
[254:25.21]I mean, this looks like a place where I feed.
[254:45.42]What is a dragon tree?
[254:54.82]A dragon tree where you feed.
[254:59.95]I mean, this dragon tree.
[255:04.51]Okay, a real bug just flew onto the screen and I thought I was in the game.
[255:10.54]It was literally like a 3D movie.
[255:12.16]That was a 3D movie.
[255:20.97]Oh, there it is.
[255:25.06]Okay.
[255:27.97]Only two more.
[255:31.61]A volcano at the entrance in a car where you warm up.
[255:35.40]Volcano at the entrance.
[255:38.67]Entrance is this way.
[255:45.62]I lied.
[255:46.16]It's this way.
[255:53.62]Volcano at the entrance.
[256:06.19]Come on, dude.
[256:07.02]OK.
[256:12.36]And then a car where you warm up, where you warm up.
[256:20.17]The fireplace.
[256:26.08]Is there a car in here?
[256:37.50]That's it.
[256:44.38]Fuck you, granny!
[256:46.13]Sorry about that.
[256:46.95]I'm sorry.
[256:51.89]I'm already here.
[256:58.40]More weird shit.
[257:26.49]Yes.
[258:06.98]What the fuck is that sound?
[258:29.47]Oh, this thing is breathing!
[258:30.81]This thing's alive!
[258:43.26]What the fuck is this?
[259:00.10]A gouge?
[259:02.38]What do I do with a gouge?
[259:11.19]Looks tough.
[259:16.76]What should I do with this?
[259:37.93]Randy's basement.
[259:50.95]Oh god.
[259:52.61]Oh my god.
[259:54.31]Oh god.
[260:01.68]I keep seeing that happen, but it doesn't really do anything.
[260:08.03]Have I played it perfectly every time?
[260:21.62]There's one more key.
[260:24.65]Dracula IV.
[260:25.47]Butt-chugger.
[260:26.45]Okay.
[260:40.18]I don't know.
[260:40.50]Every time I think... I just think... I don't know why this person pops into my head when I think of that.
[260:45.99]Whenever... And this is not because of any reason in particular.
[260:50.19]But whenever I hear the word butt chug, boom, Steve-O is just in my head.
[260:55.48]Do you know what I mean?
[260:56.00]Like Steve-O is in my head and he's just doing it.
[260:59.74]It's always Steve-O.
[261:02.20]And there's no reason for that, right?
[261:03.89]Like I don't think he did that.
[261:05.87]Did he?
[261:06.49]I don't think so.
[261:08.19]Did Steve-O do that?
[261:17.16]Dude, can I tell you something?
[261:18.44]Guy, this is important too.
[261:20.32]When you, okay, I have seen thousands of images in my life.
[261:26.93]I have been to college.
[261:29.39]I've been to obviously high school.
[261:31.93]I went through tons of education.
[261:33.82]I've seen tons of movies, tons of television, tons of streamers and YouTubers.
[261:40.39]And it's crazy because the one thing that's going to stick with me forever is
[261:44.33]When I say the word Stevo, right?
[261:47.15]You know that Stevo picture where he's like, like this and there's like all that shit around him?
[261:52.10]Like I don't know if it's drugs or whatever it is.
[261:54.32]That image is like going, that's just, whenever I, I remember that image more than I remember going to fucking high school.
[262:03.63]I remember that image so vividly more than classes I took in history.
[262:10.67]And, like, that's crazy that that picture is going to, like, potentially transcend so much information.
[262:17.16]Do you know what I mean?
[262:17.66]Because everybody knows that picture.
[262:19.81]That is, like, that is, like, the photo that everybody can remember.
[262:26.58]Steve-O butt chugs in Jackass 2.
[262:30.89]But it's funny that I think the Steve-O laying, doing that on the ground image is going to be more important to me than George Washington cutting the tree down.
[262:40.21]I think that's going to transcend that.
[262:41.82]I think it's going to be remembered by more people.
[262:51.85]I watched the Jackass stuff recently, like a lot of the Jackass movies.
[262:56.55]Those guys were fucking crazy.
[262:58.62]Some of those movies are, and some of the TV shows, they're... Oh my god, they're so funny.
[263:04.69]They're genuinely... Dude, the best part of those movies, and I love these guys for this, by the way, is at the end of all the Jackass movies, Jackass 1, Jackass 2, Jackass the movie 3, Rip Taylor is at the end of every movie.
[263:19.60]And he's just like, oh, Johnny Knoxville.
[263:22.27]Oh, son of a jackass.
[263:23.89]Oh, I have vodka and prune juice.
[263:26.49]It's called a pile driver.
[263:28.20]He is so fucking goddamn funny.
[263:34.13]So goddamn funny.
[263:38.09]And I think, and I think Steve-O's like doing good.
[263:40.65]Steve-O's got like a podcast.
[263:42.04]He's like, he's still working and stuff.
[263:44.34]Steve-O's fucking doing well.
[263:47.14]It's just crazy that like 20 plus years later, these guys doing all this funny, wacky stuff.
[263:54.21]That's awesome to see.
[263:55.21]That's great.
[263:57.04]I've watched a lot of their older stuff recently and it was just like, man, these guys were just, they were almost like invincible in a way.
[264:05.63]It was wild.
[264:07.59]But that's great.
[264:08.17]That's awesome that Steve-O's kind of, he's got like a whole nother thing going on.
[264:13.24]So that's great.
[264:16.66]50 years old?
[264:19.37]Oh my god, what's happening to me?
[264:23.34]What the hell is that thing?
[264:30.94]What is it?
[264:45.68]that was granny ah that that might have been granny that might have been granny is granny a dog okay wait what do I do with the axe
[265:16.92]Cut her down?
[265:17.68]No, that's not a fucking butt-chugging granny.
[265:39.52]Did it look like a dog?
[265:40.58]Yeah, dude, it kind of looked like a dog.
[265:42.38]It's walking around like this on all fours, backwards, like a fucking crab dog lady, okay?
[265:49.28]What do I do?
[266:02.34]Oh, my stomach.
[266:05.00]Elaborate?
[266:06.36]Elaborate on what?
[266:07.40]Okay, I'm going to stand up.
[266:10.13]She's right here.
[266:10.99]Look.
[266:12.05]You didn't think this is kind of- You don't think this is kind of dog-like?
[266:21.40]She's walking around on all fours.
[266:26.77]Does she just patrol the area?
[266:28.37]Is this actually Granny?
[266:29.55]And why are we saying Granny?
[266:31.85]We don't know who this monster is.
[266:33.88]You've implanted that into my head.
[266:35.76]It's not a Granny.
[266:38.88]It's something else.
[266:50.68]Anyways, Rip Taylor is one of the greatest comedians to ever live.
[266:55.12]He used to walk out.
[266:57.03]His thing was he would have a little thing of confetti and he would just throw it all over people.
[267:04.68]Oh, he was so funny.
[267:07.68]Okay, so let's get this.
[267:10.71]Find the last elevator key.
[267:13.83]I think I can break the padlock that was out here.
[267:19.89]Remember the padlock?
[267:21.66]It's upstairs in the house.
[267:23.95]Oh, thank you.
[267:25.10]Appreciate it.
[267:53.76]You guys are killing me right now.
[268:01.94]Upstairs in that cupboard.
[268:04.49]I gotta get outta here.
[268:23.32]Bingo.
[268:31.34]I think it didn't break anything, but made a lot of noise.
[268:35.30]Caution, very corrosive, perfect.
[268:39.71]Okay, so I got corrosive liquid.
[268:45.25]What do I do with it?
[268:49.18]In here?
[268:55.73]A bottle with corrosive, and on the lock outside, right?
[269:02.29]Uh, that is highly corrosive, reactive, and toxic.
[269:08.95]What?
[269:09.25]That may as well have been nuclear waste.
[269:12.28]In that bottle.
[269:27.16]I think I'll maybe sneak a little sneaker-doodle-bite.
[269:31.00]I'll get a sneaker-doodle-bite on that.
[269:32.62]Hey, what's a sneaker-doodle-bite from?
[269:33.99]10 points to whoever says that.
[269:37.17]First.
[269:47.14]You're just sitting there.
[269:50.02]Don't look at me like that.
[269:51.16]Those eyes are freaking me the fuck out.
[269:53.16]Can I walk by you?
[270:33.60]I don't think she attacks you.
[270:37.06]Close that door though, just in case she does.
[270:41.49]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[270:42.17]I got the corrosive liquid.
[270:45.62]And I'm ready to put it on to the padlock outside.
[270:50.82]Dude.
[271:08.70]What's that?
[271:09.18]What is it?
[271:12.54]Flashlight doesn't work anymore.
[271:13.84]Yes, it does.
[271:28.25]Is that correct?
[271:30.82]Use the corrosive liquid on the padlock out here.
[271:34.82]You need to save the game.
[271:36.02]I'm good.
[271:36.52]I ain't gonna die.
[271:51.96]Am I good?
[271:55.45]So that's not Granny, that's Granny's avatar.
[272:15.56]Where's that door?
[272:21.71]Where was that door?
[272:22.61]Where was that door?
[272:27.98]I love this entrance.
[272:29.04]It's so beautiful.
[272:30.86]I actually love it.
[272:33.79]Dude, hold on a second.
[272:34.91]Hold on.
[272:35.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[272:35.73]I'm sorry.
[272:43.36]I want this as like a desktop background.
[272:44.74]I'm not even fucking kidding with you.
[272:52.14]Bro!
[273:01.29]Yeah, that's a great background.
[273:04.58]Right there.
[273:05.50]Wait, hold on.
[273:07.94]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[273:09.30]Get me out of the photo.
[273:10.54]Get me out of the photo.
[273:14.25]I think that's a good one right there.
[273:15.49]Maybe a little bit more to the right.
[273:19.05]I want that house in the frame.
[273:24.32]Are you kidding me?
[273:25.26]Are you trying to tell me that's not a perfect desktop background for fall?
[273:34.03]Uh, what's going on?
[273:42.69]You've ruined my photo.
[273:51.51]Ooh, that looks good.
[273:53.13]Holy shit.
[273:54.63]Okay.
[273:55.51]I gotta put the corrosive liquid on the thing.
[274:01.38]And then whatever happens through this door, this one's done.
[274:03.93]And I might do one more.
[274:05.97]Maybe.
[274:08.07]It's getting late.
[274:08.56]Here we go.
[274:11.86]Corrosive liquid.
[274:33.17]What do I mean, force it now?
[274:35.41]I think I could for- So force it open!
[274:40.12]Let's go.
[274:41.76]GG.
[274:52.05]Granny's secret stash.
[274:55.35]Teddy bear that one of the children was carrying when he disappeared.
[274:57.95]They've now stopped broadcasting it on TV every day.
[275:09.60]Bro, what the fuck?
[275:10.79]Okay, hold on.
[275:12.23]Found it.
[275:16.29]Is that water?
[275:16.89]What is that?
[275:24.32]Oh, well, I found the pipe.
[275:31.21]What should I do?
[275:31.71]What do I do?
[275:36.80]Water can be heard coming from the well.
[275:38.64]So did I find it?
[275:41.43]Go in it.
[275:46.24]I think I. Now go cut the rope.
[275:53.55]OK.
[275:57.25]I think we're almost done with this one.
[275:59.85]Take the pill that makes you smaller and go.
[276:06.96]I was doing something.
[276:38.64]Alright, who threw the scalding hot water on me right there?
[276:40.96]Come on.
[276:42.62]Own up to it.
[276:52.96]It was me, sorry?
[276:57.54]What the fuck are you thinking?
[276:59.55]What are you thinking?
[277:02.41]I'm in the middle of a stream and you throw scalding hot water at me.
[277:05.60]Would you think that was funny?
[277:07.22]He's trying to get like a moment here.
[277:08.58]I thought maybe I would like a good on TV like what?
[277:15.36]What's with you man?
[277:32.18]I heard something metallic moving through the pipe.
[277:41.97]This weird little dog is freaking me out.
[277:44.28]Okay, so it went through the pipe.
[277:48.20]Does it go back down?
[277:52.24]Back down to where it just was?
[278:07.53]Where was that?
[278:08.18]I don't remember.
[278:10.73]Guys, I'm 16 vodka cranberries deep.
[278:14.16]I don't know where that was.
[278:14.82]Where was it?
[278:40.34]You say the word butt chug.
[278:42.61]16 or 17 times on a stream.
[278:47.12]And it's all your chat is going to say forever.
[278:50.77]That's all I'm saying.
[279:24.42]and here it is the final basement key to the critically acclaimed cult classic video game on steam horror globes
[279:55.01]That's nice too.
[279:56.47]Hold on guys.
[279:57.73]Hold on a second.
[280:06.78]Alright, whoever made this game.
[280:08.97]Can I just tell you that your ability to make like an aesthetic like really beautiful landscape with using color?
[280:19.04]And using the different contrast.
[280:22.70]You got a good future here, don't you?
[280:25.22]I'm actually not even kidding.
[280:30.15]Like, really aesthetically pleasing landscape.
[280:38.30]Alright, is she going to be right here?
[280:42.08]She was here before.
[280:42.76]Okay, here we go.
[280:55.02]What's the final trick in Granny's trick or treat house?
[281:02.73]She might be right here.
[281:20.41]Wrong elevator.
[281:44.87]OK.
[281:46.39]Let's go.
[281:48.15]Bingo.
[281:54.74]It's working.
[281:56.21]Alright, let's go.
[281:58.73]Do it at your own risk is the achievement I just got.
[282:05.28]That actually got me.
[282:28.37]I realize I don't really have a scream.
[282:30.01]I have more of a... Like, it's a... It's a... Oh, God.
[282:55.45]It's kind of like Mario.
[282:56.71]Yeah.
[282:58.44]If Mario played scary games, it really would be like that.
[283:01.87]It'd be like, oh, Luigi!
[283:05.19]Why would he scream for Luigi?
[283:12.14]Bones.
[283:15.53]It's Luigi that screams for Mario.
[283:19.32]You kind of sound like a gibbon.
[283:21.22]Wait, what?
[283:25.49]Yeah.
[283:42.49]Hey, we all derive from apes, okay?
[283:45.09]All of us are apes.
[283:47.84]So I'm a little more ape-like than the rest of you.
[283:57.22]Hey!
[284:09.48]It's like a real picture of like a kid.
[284:16.71]Jelly candy recipe.
[284:20.15]I didn't know that jelly was made from skin, bone, and cartilage.
[284:23.84]This looks like you.
[284:24.88]No, it does not.
[284:25.84]It's, it's... Okay.
[284:27.38]Fine, dude.
[284:42.97]Oh, shit.
[284:44.57]Oh, this ain't good.
[284:53.97]She's in that room.
[285:24.90]She's cooking people.
[285:33.85]Sorry mom, am I late for dinner?
[285:44.71]Why did she do the like... Like... Take my hand!
[285:52.44]Thanks for playing.
[285:54.20]What a twist at the end.
[286:08.72]Cool.
[286:12.35]I like that one.
[286:12.93]I like I like the little weird granny dog that ran around.
[286:18.46]Alright.
[286:19.94]Let's take a break.
[286:21.16]I'll come back and we'll figure out if we're going to do any more.
[286:25.61]I could maybe hit you with one more.
[286:28.27]Maybe one more.
[286:29.15]One more quick one.
[286:30.87]Short one.
[286:31.55]Maybe.
[286:34.44]That was Horror Globes.
[286:35.42]It's on Steam.
[286:37.50]That was fun.
[286:40.72]That was a good one.
[286:43.43]I'll be right back.
[286:44.93]We'll figure it out.
[287:08.17]I pressed every single wrong button you could probably press, just if you're curious.
[287:42.58]Okay, I look over in Mod Chat and I see, in all capitals, unmuted.
[287:48.92]They're looking out for me over here.
[287:49.91]They really are.
[287:53.14]I'll be right back.
[291:17.79]How's it going?
[291:20.70]We are going to do one more.
[291:25.89]And this one is a pretty quick one.
[291:28.19]This one's called John's Dog.
[291:32.26]John's Dog.
[291:35.25]Hey, your facecam is frozen.
[291:36.51]That's alright.
[291:46.83]John from Garfield.
[291:48.09]I think just John from John.
[291:59.04]Don't worry.
[291:59.64]We proved everybody I'm drinking water.
[292:06.69]I'm good.
[292:08.25]Don't worry.
[292:11.45]No, I told you I'm not no more.
[292:13.50]No more vodka cranberries.
[292:15.62]It's like 11.
[292:16.52]It's 11.
[292:17.24]It's like 2 a.m.
[292:18.02]for you.
[292:20.29]Okay, here we go.
[292:22.19]John's dog.
[292:24.99]Should see it in a second.
[292:35.61]John's dog.
[292:40.11]There's a Vocaloid artist that sampled your scream in a lot of her songs.
[292:46.74]Cool.
[292:49.40]Alright, let's go.
[292:54.79]Uh, how do I play it?
[292:57.47]Play.
[292:58.49]Can I... Did I fuck it up?
[293:10.00]How do I play the game?
[293:14.20]Type play.
[293:16.66]Why did I believe you?
[293:20.45]Arrow keys?
[293:23.49]Hold on.
[293:27.34]I'll reload it.
[293:28.18]Refresh.
[293:30.09]Just a quick refresh.
[293:56.43]Hero keys don't work.
[294:00.36]Weird.
[294:03.36]Do you have a controller plugged in?
[294:04.56]I shouldn't.
[294:05.22]No.
[294:06.71]Enter?
[294:07.43]No.
[294:07.79]Space?
[294:08.99]F1.
[294:10.07]F2.
[294:10.43]F3.
[294:14.18]Looks like I can move my head around.
[294:17.48]Z?
[294:20.43]WASD?
[294:21.05]Escape?
[294:24.83]Uh-oh.
[294:27.62]Oh no, John's dog.
[294:34.28]Win alt control L. Hey, do you like pizza?
[294:44.99]Yeah, I love pizza.
[294:45.67]Pepperoni's my favorite.
[294:47.57]Maybe put a controller in.
[294:55.14]Let me refresh it one more time.
[295:02.48]That's weird.
[295:03.36]This one seemed really cute and fun and crazy and funny.
[295:10.01]Um, you need a driving wheel.
[295:15.01]Maybe it's a browser game.
[295:16.42]Oh, I have the exe.
[295:17.42]I have the application for it.
[295:22.46]Hold on a second.
[295:30.45]Play the new white knuckle update instead.
[295:38.00]Oh no, it doesn't work.
[295:42.07]No, John's dog.
[295:43.11]We wanted to see John's dog.
[295:44.65]Oh man.
[295:56.90]E?
[295:57.42]No, E doesn't work either.
[296:00.13]Let me see.
[296:00.47]Is it going to read me in the files?
[296:01.93]Let's see.
[296:03.33]I'll give this one or two more minutes and we'll... You know what?
[296:05.81]I'll do White Knuckle in a minute.
[296:07.15]We'll do that.
[296:08.19]Look, John's dog.
[296:09.45]It's right there.
[296:12.18]And a picture of me.
[296:18.96]Look at how beautiful this is, though.
[296:20.90]I don't see, like, a read me in here.
[296:37.64]Hold on.
[296:54.28]Click the bottom of the P?
[296:58.66]Wait, I'm seeing... Hey, wait.
[297:00.02]Somebody said, wait.
[297:01.10]The highlight is funky.
[297:06.39]Alt-enter and then try it?
[297:11.39]Play should be yellow when you hover your mouse over it.
[297:15.90]Oh, what's happening?
[297:17.60]Ah!
[297:17.98]Ah!
[297:23.80]Ah.
[297:26.00]Ayo!
[297:33.85]You got anything to drink?
[297:36.91]No.
[297:38.51]But I can go buy something from the store if you take care of Mira.
[297:42.20]Who?
[297:43.22]Mira.
[297:44.56]My new dog.
[297:46.70]When did you even get her?
[297:49.67]Yesterday.
[297:50.81]She was just walking around my house and didn't want to leave.
[297:54.55]Weird.
[297:56.75]Now I'm happy she didn't leave.
[297:59.61]I've always wanted a dog.
[298:01.56]Okay, I will be going now.
[298:03.68]Take care of the house.
[298:05.52]And don't let Mirror just... Fuck, I can't take that sound.
[298:11.13]W-A-S-D?
[298:12.76]E?
[298:14.12]Q is stop the dog.
[298:21.23]Stop doing that.
[298:21.95]Hey, come here.
[298:26.01]Stop it!
[298:28.05]Come here, stop that!
[298:33.28]Stop eating the curtains!
[298:35.24]How do I put this down?
[298:39.39]John, your dog is fucked up!
[298:42.65]Stop that!
[298:47.98]Hey!
[298:55.79]Is this the game?
[298:56.77]Is this the game?
[298:58.06]Is this the whole game?
[299:00.80]Is this the game?
[299:01.28]Is this the whole game?
[299:04.96]Okay, stop that.
[299:05.84]Is this the whole game?
[299:15.61]This game, I don't know about this one.
[299:22.08]Is there anything else I do besides this?
[299:26.15]Alright, okay, alright, hey!
[299:31.00]Stop!
[299:34.43]Where'd he go?
[299:35.01]Where'd he go?
[299:35.57]Did he go upstairs?
[299:38.65]Hey!
[299:40.76]Where'd the dog go?
[299:41.60]Oh shit!
[299:49.61]Stop it, leave it alone.
[299:50.81]Don't do that.
[300:00.97]You fucked up the whole curtain, dude.
[300:06.54]How long do I have to do this for?
[300:21.26]I don't wanna do this anymore.
[300:38.31]Stop!
[300:39.17]Hey!
[300:39.47]Put that down.
[300:42.60]Open the door?
[300:43.30]I can't do anything else but this.
[300:50.40]This is all I can do.
[301:18.37]Put it down!
[301:19.05]Put it down!
[301:26.24]Press E?
[301:27.28]I'm pressing Q!
[301:28.54]There's only three objects to interact with in the whole game!
[301:50.01]What do I do?
[301:51.55]How do I progress?
[301:53.68]I'm stuck here forever.
[302:00.63]Okay, stop!
[302:10.76]I don't give a shit anymore.
[302:11.78]Go ahead, you can ruin the whole house.
[302:19.23]Yeah, hey!
[302:33.62]The dog just sprinted.
[302:36.94]Weird.
[302:37.40]Okay.
[303:01.54]That was John's dog.
[303:04.72]I was told specifically to play this game.
[303:16.88]Let's let him destroy it.
[303:24.25]Go ahead, do whatever you want.
[303:30.74]Who told you to play this?
[303:39.04]You wanna out yourself in the chat?
[303:50.93]You wanna... You gotta get outed in the chat.
[303:59.54]Holly told me to play John's dog.
[304:01.32]She's like, you gotta play John's dog.
[304:02.61]She's like, yeah, I'm telling you.
[304:03.43]You gotta play John's dog.
[304:04.65]You can't just... You can't end the stream without playing John's dog.
[304:07.86]And I was like, alright, John's dog.
[304:17.60]I guess we're playing it.
[304:22.50]You look like NBA star.
[304:24.07]I look like an NBA star?
[304:25.47]Sick.
[304:30.41]I wish I could shoot hoops and dunk.
[304:35.35]Why do you play shovelware games?
[304:36.65]These are not... Excuse me.
[304:39.26]Tying that person up for an hour.
[304:43.07]These are... What the fuck is going on?
[304:51.84]What the hell was that?
[304:52.68]I just heard broken glass.
[304:55.49]What was that?
[305:06.86]What is he- is he- What the f- Why is this guy in the game?
[305:57.35]Excuse me?
[306:14.02]What's the third ending?
[306:32.82]Got to go upstairs?
[306:37.51]Dude, some guy just ate me.
[306:41.34]What was that all about?
[306:42.63]Why?
[306:43.49]What is that?
[307:01.98]I can't do anything in the kitchen.
[307:10.33]I thought he just took a sip from a vodka bottle.
[307:12.69]Oh, man.
[307:13.13]That would be bad.
[307:14.37]What do I do?
[307:15.31]Knife in the kitchen.
[307:17.54]Knife?
[307:17.82]I didn't see a knife.
[307:20.18]Knife in the kitchen?
[307:21.28]Oh, wait.
[307:22.94]How do I pick that up?
[307:25.15]Go upstairs.
[307:25.73]Go upstairs.
[307:26.15]Go upstairs.
[307:26.59]Upstairs.
[307:26.93]Up, up, up, up, up.
[307:32.46]Nothing up here.
[307:33.94]Press E. E on everything.
[307:35.42]E. Nothing.
[307:46.09]E. Nothing.
[307:47.40]Nothing works.
[307:54.91]After the dog jumps out, go upstairs.
[308:31.06]Go, go, go, go, go.
[308:32.10]Upstairs.
[308:38.68]What the fuck?
[308:39.36]Okay, now go to the kitchen and get a knife.
[308:47.50]Get a knife.
[309:12.91]Oh, you piece of shit!
[309:15.02]I got it.
[309:15.34]I got it.
[309:15.76]I got it.
[309:16.04]One more try.
[309:17.30]One more.
[309:17.54]One more.
[309:18.06]One more.
[309:18.30]One.
[309:21.19]One more try.
[309:21.85]That's it.
[309:23.59]I didn't know that the stamina bar mattered.
[309:27.14]Last try.
[309:33.57]Fucking John's dog.
[309:41.85]You look like you'd be an ice skating or hockey athlete.
[309:50.32]I'm not any of those things.
[309:56.01]Just a guy that makes noises on the internet.
[310:00.84]I could have been a fucking hockey player.
[310:02.40]I could have been a basketball star.
[310:05.44]I could have been a baseball player.
[310:06.26]I could have been a writer.
[310:07.55]I could have been a novelist.
[310:13.43]Okay, here we go.
[310:19.88]Speedrun.
[310:24.43]I think the speedrun is... so watch my stamina.
[310:42.45]World record pace.
[310:45.31]Let's see if we can get it.
[310:47.14]What's the world record on this right now?
[310:48.56]1.12?
[310:57.75]Oh, we're doing one white knuckle run?
[311:09.92]Because I don't give a shit.
[311:11.76]Okay?
[311:12.08]After this.
[311:14.87]Maybe two.
[311:19.03]He goes out that window.
[311:28.63]Here we go.
[311:33.75]Have you played the bleakest keep?
[311:41.66]I have not.
[311:42.70]I don't know what that is.
[312:07.77]Into the kitchen.
[312:09.31]Living room.
[312:10.06]Biggest room in the game.
[312:11.98]Oh my god, he's already here!
[312:13.10]I didn't think he was already here.
[312:31.21]More than three hits?
[312:32.11]Are you shitting me?
[312:51.73]Huh?
[312:56.40]John's dog.
[313:02.41]John's dog.
[313:03.59]Good.
[313:05.39]I probably could have saved another three or four seconds there.
[313:09.70]Unfortunate.
[313:10.36]I probably could have got like ten seconds off the PB.
[313:15.13]That's a PB though.
[313:15.99]That's pretty good.
[313:24.81]Now I'm just seeing people write butt chug in this chat.
[313:27.19]Like, it's just like a thing.
[313:28.27]It's like a non sequitur for you now.
[313:31.36]It's just like, oh, yeah, butt chug.
[313:35.72]Like, you have to write that.
[313:36.70]I'm saying it.
[313:37.99]You have to type it.
[313:40.19]Who am I replying to?
[313:44.49]I don't know why I was replying to somebody.
[313:46.60]I was mid reply for like an hour.
[313:49.44]How?
[313:49.60]How?
[313:50.88]Alright, let's do a white knuckle.
[313:53.10]I'll do like a couple of runs, maybe one or two.
