[00:17.03]I've been here for two fucking straight hours.
[00:20.59]Just listening.
[00:24.81]I feel pretty good.
[00:27.66]I didn't move.
[00:32.16]Hey, welcome back everybody.
[00:35.36]Come back.
[00:37.50]Tell us the bad news.
[00:39.00]What bad news?
[00:39.84]Did I tweet that under somebody?
[00:41.04]I always think I fucking do that.
[00:42.24]I don't know why.
[00:45.58]I never left.
[00:46.50]How'd it go?
[00:49.50]It was good.
[00:52.68]It was good.
[00:57.83]He got brain fluid poisoning.
[01:01.61]Yeah, we're gonna finish up this stream part two.
[01:10.03]I have probably an hour or two left of Mega Man Legends, and that's where we're going to call it.
[01:15.56]I don't want to play this tomorrow.
[01:17.62]Black and White 2 is tomorrow.
[01:20.30]Let's finish this today.
[01:20.98]Let's get this done.
[01:22.00]You know what I'm saying?
[01:26.08]Now why can I not connect to chat?
[01:29.48]I just had it.
[01:30.00]Alright, hold on.
[01:33.82]Can I... Is everybody else's chat messed up?
[01:41.39]Hello?
[01:45.33]Can you see this?
[01:50.35]Well, I got you guys on another monitor anyways.
[01:53.15]Alright, I can see you guys now.
[01:54.61]I just can't see you in the window I usually see you in.
[01:57.73]Alright, so what were we doing?
[01:58.65]I had... I was doing... I got the final key, and then I saved it here.
[02:08.12]I beat the boss.
[02:11.29]Did the other games in the TV studio?
[02:12.61]I already did.
[02:13.71]I already aced the other games in the TV studio.
[02:16.80]I got all the parts from the two.
[02:18.02]Alright, what do I want to do?
[02:20.84]Go get the red lipstick at the Apple Market to give to the artist in Uptown.
[02:24.94]You got it!
[02:25.44]I need to go east and then south.
[02:40.29]Yeah, I didn't know if it was going to take another hour or so, but it didn't.
[02:44.01]I'm back now.
[02:45.77]We can get this done now.
[02:48.83]Alright, I need to get to the Apple Market.
[02:52.37]Now we go south.
[02:55.59]That's west.
[02:56.99]Was that north or west?
[03:01.73]Yeah, I talked to the artist before.
[03:03.05]I told the artist that they don't have any talent.
[03:05.54]Is.
[03:05.64]Is that bad?
[03:06.94]Does that lock me out?
[03:10.95]What about that, the pie, the race?
[03:12.79]I already did it.
[03:14.11]I aced it.
[03:15.23]You must have left early!
[03:16.14]I aced it!
[03:18.56]Alright, uh, who has red lipstick?
[03:28.76]You?
[03:31.06]Once this is all over with, we'll give you a special deal.
[03:34.04]All the bread you can eat.
[03:35.34]Oh, that's a bakery.
[03:42.56]Who has lipstick?
[03:47.43]Electric goods.
[03:49.27]Toy store.
[03:51.59]In here?
[03:52.01]Wait, why can't... Get out of my way!
[04:00.93]The grocer's wife still hasn't come back yet.
[04:03.15]I wonder if she's alright.
[04:08.61]Sourdough lipstick.
[04:09.99]Imagine.
[04:32.13]One second, though.
[04:32.59]I'll keep the clothes I got.
[04:34.15]I mean, after all, they were present, right?
[04:36.61]I wouldn't want to hurt my boyfriend's feelings.
[04:44.03]Nothing in here.
[04:46.46]Talk to the clerk?
[04:50.78]Stare into the mirror.
[04:55.30]Oh, Mega Man, I'm so frightened.
[04:56.40]Where do I get the lipstick?
[05:01.26]In the electronics store?
[05:04.08]I see you got a VCR fridge.
[05:06.02]How much is the lipstick?
[05:13.13]Over here?
[05:16.85]I'm praying to God and my dead husband to watch over you and protect this island.
[05:24.53]Jeez.
[05:26.11]It's supposed to be that cashier in HipBone.
[05:36.19]What the heck?
[05:40.30]I need to talk to the painter.
[05:41.28]Didn't I already?
[05:41.98]Remember I was like, you have no talent.
[05:43.54]Oh, I could really use some red.
[05:44.66]And I was like, yeah, you could.
[05:53.37]Yeah, I did.
[05:55.37]I talked to the artist like two times.
[05:59.23]Do it again?
[05:59.63]I guess we're doing it again.
[06:10.90]What are you saying?
[06:11.38]I have to... Try another!
[06:15.28]Okay.
[06:35.56]He's actually back.
[06:36.66]Yeah!
[06:38.50]Wait, you think I was lying?
[06:39.86]You think I wasn't gonna come back?
[06:46.04]Nah, guys, hey, I'll be back in a couple hours, two or three hours.
[06:49.22]No, just, I'm not coming back, and I'm not gonna finish Mega Man Legends.
[06:52.67]Fuck it.
[06:53.13]It's gonna go unfinished forever.
[06:54.87]We already did this.
[07:05.74]Remember, some talon, some red.
[07:07.22]Mm-hmm.
[07:21.25]Okay.
[07:22.19]So, now we go talk to Cashier.
[07:24.58]What's my thoughts on PB&J sandwiches?
[07:26.92]Disgusting.
[07:27.42]Get rid of them.
[07:28.48]Gross.
[07:29.32]Replace the jelly with fluff.
[07:30.98]And then you've got... Now you've got a believer out of me.
[07:33.42]PB&J.
[07:34.01]No, no, no, no, no.
[07:34.59]PB&... Fluff.
[07:36.03]Hug.
[07:37.19]Sorry.
[07:44.48]What?
[07:52.06]What?
[07:53.56]Is that... Really?
[07:54.36]I thought Jelly was... I thought people didn't like... I thought Jelly was a... Well, actually, I did just say disgusting, didn't I?
[08:05.43]Yeah, that's not fair.
[08:07.93]Hey, William, thanks for the five community subs, William.
[08:12.05]I didn't rebuild?
[08:12.73]No, I haven't rebuilt anything.
[08:14.25]I have... Alright, okay.
[08:17.71]I've got $76,000.
[08:19.33]Should I rebuild some stuff?
[08:21.11]I think it's time.
[08:26.29]Where do I go?
[08:26.67]To City Hall?
[08:27.23]Who rebuilds stuff?
[08:34.51]Rebuild the town.
[08:36.27]But that's money that I can't spend on me.
[08:40.70]I know that sounds fucking horrible, but you know what I mean?
[08:43.02]I need to be able to... The artist is the museum lady.
[08:50.72]Oh.
[08:51.10]Well, let's... First of all...
[08:54.06]Let's go get the red lipstick.
[08:57.22]That's priority number one.
[09:23.38]I will only gift to this stream.
[09:25.24]I will never subscribe myself because your content is so far.
[09:29.90]What?
[09:32.12]Why would you pay more money to a stream that you don't like?
[09:36.61]What?
[09:39.83]That doesn't fit in any logic.
[09:47.89]It's a power play.
[09:52.72]I don't really like this stream, but I'm gonna pay extra money to it.
[09:57.92]Yes, give it to me.
[09:58.54]I'll give you mine.
[09:59.30]Thank you, SuperBruce.
[10:22.39]Glad I could help you.
[10:23.01]See you later.
[10:23.63]Okay, got lipstick.
[10:25.67]Let's go give lipstick to Lady.
[10:30.42]Here we go.
[10:32.84]That's right.
[10:35.64]And where's the hype train?
[10:36.64]I turned off hype train.
[10:38.46]They don't exist anymore.
[10:45.47]I don't- they don't exist.
[10:54.64]Imagine subbing to Jerma.
[11:02.24]Can you imagine?
[11:05.28]Downtown, Uptown.
[11:07.32]Uptown is to the left, Downtown is to the right.
[11:19.70]Can you imagine giving this guy any money?
[11:24.30]He's a fucking stupid fucking goddamn fucking idiot.
[11:26.58]Fucking stupid fucking idiot.
[11:29.54]Alright, I got red lipstick for you.
[11:35.20]Thought I was gonna get hit by that car.
[11:36.74]No, if I get hit by a car, I'd have to get 500,000 subs.
[11:39.72]You think I'm gonna get hit by a car right now?
[11:50.08]Look what I have.
[11:53.65]what's that hey could I borrow that for a second I feel like I'm watching something on TV that's designed for like a one-year-old that's it that's perfect the way that she's talking that's exactly what it needed thank you so much oh would you look at the time I better be going
[12:18.97]Hey!
[12:20.07]Don't get hit by the car!
[12:23.09]Wait, what?
[12:24.19]What just happened?
[12:28.09]What did I do?
[12:29.35]I didn't get anything for that.
[12:35.53]Alright, she's gone.
[12:36.46]So now go to the museum.
[12:39.72]The museum doesn't exist, I have to rebuild it.
[12:42.70]So I have to go to City Hall, right?
[12:45.54]So I gotta go east, n-north.
[12:54.87]It's that building right here.
[12:56.75]This one?
[12:57.33]Wait, this one right- right here?
[12:58.64]Is this the museum?
[13:00.04]This IS the museum.
[13:03.52]No, this is the doctor's office!
[13:13.66]The one with the green woof?
[13:15.50]Uh, sorry, that's K-T-O-X-T-V.
[13:20.26]This one.
[13:21.22]Oh, this is the one that was closed.
[13:23.10]Oh!
[13:24.38]So she works here now.
[13:25.84]Okay.
[13:26.70]So that's why she had to leave, because now she works here.
[13:29.60]Does this place have a door?
[13:33.33]I tried to go in here before, and it was like, Sorry, we're closed.
[13:40.71]Good afternoon.
[13:43.74]Eh, it's alright.
[14:11.51]It looks like something out of a sci-fi movie, doesn't it?
[14:18.01]Eh, it's alright.
[14:21.81]This painting was apparently found in a ruin somewhere.
[14:25.43]It looks like a person wearing blue armor is fighting with a frightening monster.
[14:30.34]I wonder what the thing that looks like an eye there is supposed to be symbolizing.
[14:38.62]Eh, it's alright.
[14:39.24]What do you think about this?
[14:42.18]Doesn't it feel like this painting is trying to tell us something?
[14:45.96]Is it a warning or a prediction?
[14:59.19]What is this?
[15:00.13]Fire in the streets?
[15:01.63]This is a painting of the marketplace.
[15:04.65]Oh, I thought this was like lava destroying a town.
[15:11.65]Alright, that one, that's alright.
[15:17.66]I wonder what that is.
[15:19.32]I don't know for sure myself.
[15:20.52]I don't know either.
[15:26.12]What is this?
[15:26.68]This is a... That's a picture of our home.
[15:28.68]Catalogs.
[15:29.87]Island, as seen from the air.
[15:31.27]Alright.
[15:34.55]Let's go upstairs.
[15:35.81]Do I have to pay for a ticket, or can I just go upstairs?
[15:41.25]You don't have to pay to go in a museum, do you?
[15:44.65]No.
[15:45.67]They're all free, aren't they?
[15:48.98]Wait, hold on.
[15:49.96]Aren't all the museums in... Most of them are free?
[15:53.72]Yeah.
[15:54.42]Depends.
[16:01.57]Oh, it's you.
[16:02.23]Yeah.
[16:08.11]You hanging it up downstairs?
[16:08.81]I just paint it for fun in my spare time.
[16:10.61]Oh.
[16:11.55]My real job is here, working as the curator.
[16:15.63]Why don't you take a look around?
[16:18.93]I know there's not much here, but... Wait!
[16:22.59]You're a digger, aren't you?
[16:25.15]If you find anything interesting on one of your digs, could you bring it here and show it to me?
[16:30.15]Do I have anything interesting?
[16:31.95]If it's really good, I could display it here.
[16:34.97]You will?
[16:36.05]Great, thanks!
[16:38.23]I just got signed up.
[16:40.89]I just went to a gym on a trial.
[16:43.82]And now I go to this gym apparently.
[16:52.13]What's that you've got there?
[16:54.84]Bone?
[16:54.96]What is it, a dinosaur bone?
[16:55.84]That's really cool.
[16:56.34]Alright, I'll just play it.
[16:57.75]You can call it a bone.
[16:58.99]How about you call it a bone from a living creature, not ancient digging tool.
[17:19.28]Thank you so much!
[17:21.83]I bet there are a lot of people who'll come to see this.
[17:29.57]I got more stuff.
[17:30.41]No.
[17:30.51]Maybe, hey, maybe you've seen some rich people.
[17:34.15]What do you think I got it?
[17:36.23]If I have one of these.
[17:55.95]How come you don't put me in that category of rich person?
[17:58.75]I have one in my pocket.
[18:00.21]Doesn't that mean I'm more rich than I'm carrying the fucking thing around?
[18:03.23]Anything else?
[18:15.79]Oh, my.
[18:17.63]Is that a crystal fossil?
[18:20.11]Do you know what that is?
[18:22.61]Those are made when a Weaverbot's body crystallizes over the centuries.
[18:28.06]They're considered grade three national treasures.
[18:32.14]It would mean so much to me if you'd let me display that here.
[18:35.06]Please.
[18:35.64]Please.
[18:39.76]I bet there are a lot of people!
[18:43.98]Okay, so do I have any more rare artifacts?
[18:51.76]Wait.
[18:52.14]Is she taking all my stuff?
[18:53.39]Is she taking my shields and shit?
[18:57.17]This is my equipment, isn't it?
[18:58.59]Is it?
[18:58.77]Thank you so much.
[18:59.57]I bet there are a lot of people who'll come to see this.
[19:16.80]Oh, what's that you have on there?
[19:18.05]That blue armor.
[19:19.11]It looks really interesting.
[19:20.39]You found that.
[19:21.25]Could I put it on display?
[19:25.81]You're a digger, right?
[19:28.33]If you find something interesting... I bet there are a lot of people.
[19:31.83]Bring it here and show me.
[19:34.46]I'll evaluate it for you.
[19:36.10]And if it's really nice, I'll put it on display here.
[19:40.85]This lady's talking into my soul.
[19:43.95]The way she's talking is... I can feel it.
[19:53.27]Alright, what did I give?
[19:55.81]Don't you think this is just the loveliest box?
[19:58.79]I really like these.
[19:59.77]Holy shit, you really were in desperate need of stuff.
[20:06.50]Look at this cardboard box in the museum!
[20:10.97]Why is there a giant emerald?
[20:12.93]That's a beautiful diamond, isn't it?
[20:14.97]It's one of my favorite displays.
[20:18.51]Uh... That's a diamond.
[20:24.96]Yet you want me to pay for the town.
[20:27.02]I have like $78,000.
[20:28.84]You have like $6 billion worth of diamond on the counter.
[20:35.66]Um... You can't like shave off a little bit of this?
[20:41.43]Ancient digging tool.
[20:42.67]Discovered in the Cardon Forest sub-gate.
[20:46.79]Appears to be made of animal bone.
[20:50.73]Alright, cool.
[20:51.49]What about this?
[20:52.93]Giant horn.
[20:53.71]Believed to be the horn fang of an animal-shaped reaverbot.
[20:56.73]Often found in rocky areas above ground.
[21:00.77]Antique shield.
[21:01.69]Grade 2 national treasure.
[21:02.93]Apparently used by reaverbots for protection.
[21:04.67]Alright.
[21:06.21]This is my grade 3.
[21:08.49]Grade 3 national treasure.
[21:09.61]Fossilized remains of a dead reaverbot.
[21:13.15]Alright, that's... What's this?
[21:15.73]That may look like any old rock, but it's really a rare and valuable specimen.
[21:22.52]I'm missing some items?
[21:24.00]Oh well.
[21:24.86]We'll never get the end.
[21:25.70]Oh, that's cool.
[21:34.60]Box and rock.
[21:39.73]Okay.
[21:40.59]So I got rid of some of those items.
[21:41.91]Now I need... Why did I instinctively just press triangle?
[21:47.50]Like I was going to get into the car.
[21:51.58]Third person Grand Theft Auto has just changed everything.
[21:55.40]Do you see a car?
[21:56.62]You try to get in it with triangle.
[21:59.26]Alright.
[22:01.73]So I need to rebuild the town.
[22:02.83]So I gotta go to the town hall, right?
[22:05.73]City hall?
[22:07.55]Can you just drive me to city hall?
[22:15.26]Mega Man gets into a car and drives to the grocery store ASMR.
[22:23.88]Why ASMR?
[22:26.61]That's so stupid.
[22:37.79]Alright, let's rebuild the town.
[22:39.07]I'll spend all my money.
[22:42.39]City Hall.
[22:42.97]Excuse me, I have an appointment.
[22:54.14]How much does it cost?
[22:54.86]Hello there Mega Man, what can I do for you?
[23:02.74]I'd like to make a donation.
[23:05.30]You will?
[23:05.78]Oh thank you so much.
[23:07.84]I wonder where we should start.
[23:10.00]Well, let's start with the residential houses.
[23:13.46]To complete the repairs to the residential houses, we need an additional 18,000 zenny.
[23:18.08]How much do you want to donate?
[23:23.68]I'd like to give $18,000.
[23:24.18]Thank you.
[23:29.24]This means so much to the island.
[23:31.64]Yep.
[23:35.57]Uh, I'd like to donate to make the con- bring back the condominium.
[23:42.17]5300 for the condominiums.
[23:44.58]What a weird number.
[23:46.30]5380.
[23:51.70]Oh, no.
[23:52.18]I gave $20 like seven and a half hours ago.
[23:55.01]I forgot.
[24:00.85]This means so much.
[24:01.61]Alright, so how long does it take?
[24:02.43]Is that it?
[24:03.55]Is that it?
[24:05.63]What can I do for you?
[24:06.73]I'd like nothing, just came to see you.
[24:09.15]Oh my, why Mega Man?
[24:09.97]I'm happy to see you too.
[24:11.89]I don't know quite what to say, thank you.
[24:13.49]Okay.
[24:24.59]So did they do it?
[24:25.25]Does it take a while?
[24:26.11]Is this 20 year old video game logic?
[24:28.51]Are they just open?
[24:40.34]Let's go back to the market.
[24:41.56]I want to buy some stuff.
[24:56.89]Do the poggers or the Kappa face.
[25:01.41]I don't know what that one is, so I know how to do this one.

[29:13.52]Okay, I know that joke, but I don't even know what beer it was.
[29:17.12]I have no idea.
[29:23.50]Okay, let's pay attention for a second.
[29:25.86]I need to do... What is it?
[29:29.30]Go to the police station.
[29:30.78]Go to the police station and get a side quest?
[29:42.52]What's my favorite time zone?
[29:45.30]The one that I currently live in.
[29:46.90]Because it's me existing in my own time.
[29:51.14]This one.
[29:57.87]The one that I'm in.
[29:58.77]Why would I have a favorite time zone?
[30:02.07]Oh, shit.
[30:02.83]I have to give 500,000 subs.
[30:04.15]Alright, let's go... Oh, look!
[30:12.88]They're doing it.
[30:15.76]See, look, they're rebuilding everything.
[30:17.58]Look at this.
[30:18.94]It's going to be a nice new town.
[30:20.48]You guys have to eat a post-it note.
[30:32.32]No, I'm in the doctors plenty enough.
[30:35.62]I don't want to go in for anything else.
[30:39.03]Alright, where's the police station?
[30:40.49]Uptown?
[30:47.41]Is there Ikea houses?
[30:50.31]Where's the police?
[30:57.19]Where's the police?
[30:57.77]Where's the police?
[30:58.35]Where's the police?
[30:59.45]Police!
[31:00.14]Hospital!
[31:00.82]Is it downtown?
[31:01.36]Did I miss it?
[31:02.06]Police!
[31:03.90]Police!
[31:05.76]Police!
[31:07.46]Police!
[31:08.22]Downtown.
[31:10.48]Yeah, I gotta go back in the north.
[31:15.79]That's two million dollars.
[31:23.99]That image is not even... That image is just... I'm not even gonna put that on stream.
[31:28.13]That's just like... I bought an iPad seven years ago, and that's what I do with it every time I turn it on.
[31:34.46]That's what that image is.
[31:49.74]Town's rebuilding, yeah.
[31:52.70]Alright, let's go.
[31:56.14]Police station.
[32:03.64]Oh, what the hell are you doing?
[32:14.50]Alright, I feel like... Oh god, that scared the shit out of me.
[32:19.11]I feel like... I feel like sometimes somebody will post an image in here, and they just went into Photoshop and hit the random button.
[32:25.84]And then they just hit save and then paste as soon as possible.
[32:40.60]Is there a randomized button in Photoshop?
[32:43.08]Why the hell wouldn't they have done that?
[32:47.56]They're losing out on a lot of potential subscribers to Adobe Photoshop.
[32:56.43]We'll let you know, take care of all the weird stuff.
[32:59.70]Give a job?
[33:01.39]I'm supposed to be out investigating everything that's been happening.
[33:05.09]But I just can't seem to get excited about work anymore.
[33:09.39]That's a little depressing, I guess.
[33:11.41]Mega Man, isn't it?
[33:12.09]The inspector's inside.
[33:13.01]Go on in.
[33:13.41]Alright, what do you got for me?
[33:23.51]We kind of reached the end of our rope with this last disaster.
[33:27.80]Things haven't completely quieted down yet, so we'll stay on alert status for a little while longer.
[33:34.06]When you have the time, stop by and talk to us sometime.
[33:36.88]Never know when we might need your help again.
[33:43.60]Oh, Mega Man!
[33:44.67]I was hoping you'd come by.
[33:46.59]There's something I'd like to ask your help with.
[33:49.81]A little while ago, this little kid with a yellow face came up to me and told me that he dropped something downtown.
[33:56.86]I didn't really understand what he said to me.
[33:59.26]He said he dropped three things and that we'd all better run or something.
[34:04.28]I'm not sure what it all means, but I've got a hunch something's not right.
[34:08.42]Could you go check things out for me?
[34:10.00]What?
[34:11.14]Thanks and good luck.
[34:16.49]What the fuck are you talking- Wait, say that again?
[34:24.33]Okay, so... This guy, he's planting... Uh, alright.
[34:29.08]This is fucked up.
[34:35.00]Alright, let's go.
[34:38.54]Yeah, this kid just did a bomb threat.
[34:40.14]I didn't really get it, though.
[34:41.36]Yeah, what the fuck is he talking about?
[34:42.62]Uh...
[34:58.05]Save before it's too late.
[34:59.71]What?
[35:03.95]I'm busy?
[35:04.67]What do you mean you're busy?
[35:12.24]What?
[35:13.98]What do you mean you're busy?
[35:55.50]He's just shit-faced.
[35:56.82]Yeah, that's just... That's a guy that's just really, really drunk.
[36:01.78]It's too late to go back.
[36:02.82]Where are these... Where are the bombs?
[36:06.32]I'm sorry.
[36:07.28]I was not paying very much attention.
[36:08.94]I was... Are they downtown?
[36:15.04]This is the bad end.
[36:31.63]How much did you pay for this copy of the game?
[36:33.21]Um, I don't think it was that expensive.
[36:35.23]I think it was pretty cheap, actually.
[36:36.25]A bomb.
[36:40.42]That must be what the inspector was talking about.
[36:43.02]You've got to find the other two before they explode.
[36:45.12]Maybe if you can find someone who saw something.
[36:54.00]No.
[36:54.88]Did you see something?
[36:56.68]What was that noise?
[36:57.82]It sounded like a bomb going off.
[36:59.80]Wait, that means that the thing I saw over by the greenhouse must have been... Oh, no!
[37:04.90]Okay, greenhouse.
[37:06.20]This is a greenhouse, right?
[37:09.44]This is a greenhouse.
[37:21.55]Oh, this also is a greenhouse.
[37:23.39]Got it.
[37:26.19]You found a bomb.
[37:27.59]Mega Man, here's the switch.
[37:29.82]There, now it's disarmed.
[37:32.96]Only one more.
[37:33.66]Alright, we can find... Excuse me, anybody?
[37:38.66]Anybody?
[37:47.08]you what do you see you see something are you looking for something you know I lost something myself recently I was fixing a roof and I forgot my tools on the roof of all places last place I thought of to look just goes to show you things are always in the place you least expect to find them who knows maybe what you're looking for is on somebody's roof is this the guy this is the is this the person that put the bomb on the roof
[38:14.71]That's very, very, incredibly descriptive.
[38:18.97]Alright, get on the roof.
[38:23.81]But what roof?
[38:28.51]There it is!
[38:29.49]Okay, it's on that roof.
[38:30.32]I see it.
[38:32.12]Okay, how do I get on?
[38:33.54]Can I jump?
[38:40.32]Done.
[38:44.52]You got bombed.
[38:46.30]Phew.
[38:46.50]Is that it?
[38:50.74]That's... There's not... Is there more than one?
[38:53.36]That's who?
[38:53.94]Didn't it say there's one more?
[38:54.68]Is that it?
[38:55.00]Am I done?
[38:56.96]The music's still going.
[39:04.32]There's three bombs.
[39:05.12]One blew up.
[39:10.08]So, that's it, right?
[39:12.48]I can leave.
[39:20.54]The music's still... I think that's good.
[39:22.32]Alright.
[39:23.20]Let's go back and talk to the inspector again.
[39:37.08]I don't know, dude.
[39:37.64]I didn't play this game.
[39:43.13]Dermot sucks at this game, though.
[39:44.47]Man, he sucks.
[39:48.11]That's...
[39:50.17]Why'd you have to say it twice?
[40:05.81]Just to make sure you saw it this way, that way, this way, that way.
[40:10.83]Irma sucks thanks to the five community subs.
[40:20.97]I did what you asked.
[40:22.91]Oh, it's you, Mega Man.
[40:24.33]I saw the report about the bombs.
[40:26.13]We're lucky you found them all.
[40:27.79]Before they went off, you saved the city again.
[40:29.81]Thanks for helping us.
[40:33.79]We're counting on you.
[40:37.14]We're counting on you.
[40:39.90]Alright.
[40:40.50]Done.
[40:46.04]You stink.
[40:47.80]I love that picture of...
[40:54.90]Hey Mega Man, I could use your help with something.
[40:58.04]A man came to us saying he's lost the money he was going to use to build his house.
[41:03.10]Poor fellow.
[41:04.40]I'd like you to see if you can find the bag this fellow dropped.
[41:08.00]The owner of the bag is out there in the lobby.
[41:11.16]You should go talk to him.
[41:21.08]You drop a bag?
[41:24.70]Reaverbots in underground cities?
[41:26.18]Oh, that's a little out of my league.
[41:29.58]Where are you?
[41:30.08]What'd you find?
[41:30.54]What'd you drop?
[41:32.88]Bustard Man.
[41:33.92]Oh, where could I have left it?
[41:36.00]I'm pretty sure I had it when I went to the electronic shop.
[41:40.75]I've been saving for years so I could build my dream house too.
[41:45.03]Oh, what am I gonna do?
[41:51.99]Humans are animals.
[41:55.01]Um, yeah.
[41:56.73]That's true.
[42:13.92]Mammal to be exact, yeah.
[42:15.80]We got a wank, I just saw it.
[42:29.47]Give me a free soda.
[42:31.27]Thank you.
[42:36.87]Do I have a beard?
[42:37.73]No, I just, I can't grow a beard.
[42:40.77]This turns into weird, gross strands of dark-looking spaghetti on my face.
[42:46.59]Alright, let's go to the southern part.
[42:55.63]Why did I choose a wink as a thing?
[42:56.85]I don't know, because... Channel Points came out, and that day I was like, oh, it's just a wink.
[43:02.83]Who cares?
[43:04.23]And now it's turned into the biggest mistake I've ever done on Twitch.
[43:07.87]This has to be the biggest mistake I've done on YouTube and Twitch combined.
[43:15.98]Alright, electronics.
[43:16.56]It's the junk shop.
[43:22.36]Where's electronics?
[43:22.96]Oh, yeah.
[43:29.59]Winx ruined his life.
[43:31.03]Alright, what do you got?
[43:33.13]You left your bag here?
[43:38.25]Someone carrying a bag.
[43:39.19]Yeah, I saw him.
[43:40.28]He said he had lots of money, so I tried to get him to buy something, but he didn't buy anything.
[43:45.26]He said that it wasn't his money to spend.
[43:47.66]He left saying he wasn't going to get something.
[43:49.60]He was going to get something to eat.
[43:50.62]Alright, so he went to the bakery.
[44:06.83]Alright, you went to the bakery.
[44:11.16]Once this is all over with, we'll give you a... No.
[44:14.10]Alright, where did he go?
[44:17.04]Over here?
[44:17.92]There are tomatoes, cucumbers, and other vegetables.
[44:24.40]That's a fake link.
[44:28.58]Is there another, like, a restaurant?
[44:34.30]Not a real link.
[44:34.86]I can see them.
[44:37.70]So where did he get food?
[44:40.30]Over here?
[44:40.74]At this meat shop?
[44:41.38]Something he had to look up?
[44:43.36]Did he go to the library?
[45:10.79]Is there a library in the game?
[45:12.03]Have I been in the library?
[45:17.13]Which building is it?
[45:20.77]Downtown?
[45:21.35]I went to the museum.
[45:27.45]Alright, library.
[45:30.59]Is this the library?
[45:40.76]This looks like a library.
[45:41.66]Alright, library.
[45:42.04]What?
[45:42.14]Is there a bar?
[45:42.50]Oh, should I... One of the vending machines?
[46:12.07]Check the vending machines.
[46:16.45]Okay, there's one here.
[46:20.85]You got a soft drink.
[46:32.45]You just wasted your channel points?
[46:36.97]I'm sorry to hear that.
[46:38.61]Um, not that one.
[46:44.47]He wanted a drink.
[46:57.19]He got a soft drink.
[47:04.34]You see anybody?
[47:06.32]A middle-aged man carrying a bag.
[47:07.56]Hmm.
[47:08.48]Well, I did see a man who didn't look well by some juice.
[47:12.48]But he didn't have a bag, though.
[47:15.00]If it's the same man, he must have lost it before coming here.
[47:17.88]Why don't you ask around?
[47:19.82]Don't you watch detective stories?
[47:21.97]That's the first step of any investigation.
[47:24.19]Find suspects and question them.
[47:36.22]So it was from the library to here.
[47:38.06]Boy, that old guy really made me angry.
[47:43.68]Get a license and registration, please.
[47:47.86]It's the killer.
[48:13.99]Alright, I got it back.
[48:15.51]Back to the police station.
[48:16.37]North.
[48:18.07]North?
[48:41.70]This song makes me want to pog.
[48:43.21]It's all good.
[48:44.77]That's a good thing.
[48:47.37]Why is it a bad thing?
[48:50.25]Directionally challenged.
[48:51.33]Yes, I know.
[48:53.17]I know.
[48:54.51]Blame the GPS system.
[48:55.53]Blame the invention of the GPS.
[48:59.77]We're all gonna be fucked.
[49:05.34]Guys, even if I'm going down the street, and I know exactly where I'm going, if I get in my car, if I know exactly where I'm going, GPS is just on.
[49:15.44]Just don't matter.
[49:17.44]It's just on.
[49:17.70]Alright, I got your bag.
[49:23.34]Where's the guy with the... I got a bag.
[49:31.29]Wait, why?
[49:31.77]I don't know.
[49:33.09]What does he do?
[49:33.73]Where's the...
[49:38.29]Why is it not in here?
[49:46.00]Oh, there you are.
[49:48.22]Wait, that bag, it looks like...
[49:52.85]What?
[49:53.07]You found it?
[49:55.15]Oh, thank you so much.
[49:56.51]I was frightened to death thinking about what my wife would do to me if she found out what had happened.
[50:01.85]As a reward, let me give you some of the money.
[50:03.45]What did you say?
[50:05.01]You don't need any?
[50:06.51]Well, here, at least accept this as thanks from me.
[50:10.44]Arm Supporter.
[50:11.24]No, give me... I'll take some money.
[50:12.48]I'm counting on you.
[50:17.88]Alright, I did it.
[50:19.06]Arm Supporter.
[50:19.80]I got a lot of new items.
[50:24.54]Wait, did he say, did he say, oh, here's some money?
[50:26.78]No, no, wait, no, actually, you don't need it.
[50:28.48]Or did I say, I don't need it?
[50:29.90]There's not much happening right now.
[50:34.86]Oh, okay.
[50:40.14]One more try.
[50:46.29]Not much happening.
[50:49.29]Somebody's sick in the hospital, okay.
[50:56.07]We'll go to the hospital.
[51:02.37]What's that?
[51:02.79]You say you don't need money?
[51:03.77]I'm gonna use that at the drive-thru.
[51:05.25]And then the person will just very, very clearly say... Sir, that'll be... That'll be $8.20.
[51:14.72]Please drive up.
[51:26.82]Fuck.
[51:27.86]Sir, that'll be $8.20.
[51:28.54]Please travel.
[51:29.76]I fucked up.
[51:30.88]I thought I had... I pressed... I fucked up.
[51:42.67]Yeah, you can't do omega LOL -2 omega LOL not counting.
[51:45.27]You're laughing.
[51:46.11]I win.
[51:46.95]I win.
[51:47.53]Alright, let's get the car.
[51:56.96]Now I'm quiet.
[51:58.20]Am I?
[52:00.12]Not anymore.
[52:00.60]Give me some development here.
[52:07.85]Uh... Plastic was used to make... Power Blaster L. This is your firing range, but your firepower as well.
[52:20.77]Hmm.
[52:20.91]Hmm.
[52:24.36]The bomb was used to make Power Blaster R. Heavy duty combat.
[52:29.68]Versus both firepower and speed.
[52:34.88]Okay.
[52:35.22]That's it?
[52:37.00]More development?
[52:39.71]Favorite fast food restaurant.
[52:40.83]Oh, that's tricky.
[52:44.63]That's tricky.
[52:46.43]I don't know if I can answer that.
[52:47.31]Alright, this is for attack.
[52:52.95]Omni Unit.
[52:53.53]Increases all abilities by 1.
[52:55.83]Power Blaster R. Nah, these are not very good.
[53:04.66]Plus 2 and 1, plus 2 and 1.
[53:06.24]No, this shit I got is way better.
[53:09.22]Plus 3 to both.
[53:16.30]Um, what's my favorite fast food place?
[53:22.27]I mean, McDonald's is a really good... McDonald's is a go-to.
[53:25.75]It's very, very... It's just, I know exactly what I like there.
[53:32.55]I don't think McDonald's is the best fast food restaurant, but it's the one that it's pretty easy to go to.
[53:39.80]I already did a tier list.
[53:57.97]Ash House Ogogo is not fast food.
[53:59.95]It's a sit-down restaurant.
[54:09.26]Wendy's?
[54:13.14]Nah, I'll be honest.
[54:14.02]I... I got sick of Wendy's.
[54:16.48]I don't know.
[54:18.86]This is weird.
[54:19.72]It's weird.
[54:20.86]I think Wendy's is a better...
[54:24.15]It's a better place than McDonald's.
[54:25.63]I think Wendy's is better than McDonald's.
[54:27.93]But I got sick of Wendy's.
[54:29.33]I didn't get... Jesus, that scared the fucking shit out of me.
[54:32.46]Stop!
[54:34.80]Who just ran me... Somebody just ran me over.
[54:36.60]I got, like, kind of sick of Wendy's.
[54:41.86]I don't know why.
[54:45.29]But I've not gotten sick of McDonald's.
[54:46.75]Alright, let's go to the hospital.
[54:52.75]Obstacles in Uptown.
[54:53.82]I thought I could beat it!
[55:04.00]Uptown is west?
[55:07.04]Yes.
[55:07.86]No, it's south and then west.
[55:09.73]Or I could just have, just drive, just bring me there.
[55:13.15]I have access to a car.
[55:36.99]Is this a person on the roof?
[55:40.97]Well, I don't know.
[55:41.59]Whatever.
[55:42.23]I'm going to the hospital.
[55:43.87]There's a sick person in the hospital to... There's a side quest in here.
[55:48.71]That's where I'm going.
[55:51.66]How much longer of this game?
[55:53.18]Until it's done?
[55:54.62]And then I'm gonna be done streaming.
[56:00.90]This is the hospital.
[56:01.86]Okay.
[56:02.24]Who's in the hospital?
[56:04.16]You?
[56:04.34]You?
[56:05.61]We don't get many patients, actually.
[56:06.87]Everyone on the island's pretty healthy.
[56:12.25]You.
[56:14.25]Are you from another island?
[56:18.09]Uh, am I?
[56:19.37]I actually don't know the answer to this question.
[56:21.71]Um, yeah.
[56:22.71]I wish I could go places, too.
[56:25.39]But just you wait and see.
[56:26.77]Once my leg gets better, I'm gonna go all over.
[56:31.70]The nurse tells me that if I keep working hard with the rehabilitation, my leg will get better in no time.
[56:39.21]Why don't you come over to my room sometime and tell me stories about where you've been?
[56:44.58]It's so boring just staying in my room by myself all day.
[56:52.60]Alright, how do I do that?
[56:53.62]I feel like I've come down with a cold.
[56:57.39]I thought I'd have the doc take a look at me.
[57:04.84]Uh, let's go.
[57:06.20]Uh, I gotta... Let's leave and come back.
[57:20.85]In the hospital with a cold.
[57:28.87]Room 305.
[57:30.81]You know, I thought I would go to the hospital.
[57:32.63]I have a stuffy nose.
[57:40.64]Did I make it?
[57:41.24]One of my patients is this darling little girl, but she's very ill and has lost the ability to walk.
[57:49.70]If we just had some more modern equipment here, we could probably cure her, but I just wish there was something I could do for her.
[57:56.50]I don't have any equipment?
[58:07.15]We don't have any equipment.
[58:12.26]Well, I'm supposed to tell her stories of my adventures.
[58:19.19]I don't have an item.
[58:29.71]Uh, yeah.
[58:30.07]Go talk to the mayor?
[58:45.45]Alright, we'll go talk to the mayor.
[58:51.86]If only there was some person who could allocate funds to the city.
[58:54.82]Some sort of mayoral figure.
[58:59.06]I know, I just wanted to talk.
[59:01.90]I just wanted to talk for a sec.
[59:04.66]Alright.
[59:06.00]Where's my special car?
[59:07.88]Take me to City Hall.
[59:09.26]I'm gonna make this... I'm gonna make this good.
[59:28.33]kill the monkey why do you guys want me to kill the monkey you can use a funny voice changer for the rest of the stream I'll do this for you I will pitch shift myself up one one tab and see if anybody realizes it as we play like this sorry like this okay so I'm pitch shifted up one tiny bit and I'm gonna tell everybody I got a new microphone
[59:59.37]Is this too noticeable?
[60:01.51]Is it?
[60:01.75]Is this too noticeable?
[60:08.84]No, it's not.
[60:10.70]You can't hear it at all.
[60:11.60]Not at all.
[60:13.44]How about that?
[60:15.74]You tell me when it gets to be too, like, absolutely he's fucking around and he's making a joke.
[60:21.70]Are we at that point now?
[60:23.02]Like, oh, wow, this is funny.
[60:24.14]He's like on a voice change run.
[60:25.20]Is that we there now?
[60:27.38]Go back?
[60:30.34]Don't go so too far, okay?
[60:32.78]So... How's this?
[60:36.08]Is this better?
[60:39.59]Right here?
[60:39.85]A little bit more?
[60:42.53]This is perfect?
[60:45.89]I'll actually heal him.
[60:46.63]What if I do this?
[60:50.31]How does this sound?
[60:51.18]This is going to be a little bit different.
[60:53.94]Should I go more?
[60:55.06]Like over here?
[60:56.72]Or back?
[61:00.86]I don't know what it sounds like.
[61:02.16]I have no idea what it sounds like.
[61:05.16]A little more?
[61:06.06]No, lower?
[61:06.84]Alright.
[61:09.83]How's that?
[61:11.05]Right here?
[61:11.63]Right there?
[61:11.97]That sounds alright, doesn't it?
[61:21.47]Right here.
[61:22.56]Right here.
[61:22.94]Higher.
[61:23.52]Too low?
[61:24.00]No, no, no.
[61:25.18]I think it's alright.
[61:25.78]Alright.
[61:27.63]Is this any different from the normal mic?
[61:29.49]Alright, I'll show you what the difference is.
[61:33.77]Uh... A, B, C, D, E, F, G. A, B, C, D, E, F, G. A, B, C, D, E, F, G. That sounds the same.
[61:48.63]That's the same.
[61:49.37]Exactly the same.
[61:50.61]No way.
[61:51.89]A, B, C, D. A, B, C, D.
[61:56.89]People think the speakers are broken?
[61:58.17]How can there be no difference?
[62:02.21]I don't understand how it could be... I don't really, like, get it.
[62:12.18]Usually I can get this solved pretty quickly.
[62:14.44]Bugleberry is now coming to the ring!
[62:17.00]Oh, yes!
[62:18.50]I thought you thought you were gonna get rid of me!
[62:30.16]I have to do that, like, once a week.
[62:31.60]I'm sorry.
[62:34.24]Somebody- Okay, person on the roof.
[62:35.74]Who the fuck is on the roof?
[62:41.47]I don't see anybody on a roof.
[62:42.65]What are you talking about?
[62:43.39]I mean, if you give me access to instant Bugleberry, I'm gonna use it, like, at least once every couple weeks.
[62:56.62]On the- Somebody's on the roof of the hospital.
[63:00.88]What?
[63:01.84]Are you serious?
[63:13.83]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[63:15.07]Where is this person?
[63:15.85]Is this person on the roof of the city hall?
[63:21.21]I don't see anybody up here.
[63:24.71]They're to the left of the city hall.
[63:33.49]There is no left of City Hall.
[63:34.77]That is City Hall, isn't it?
[63:46.26]There's nobody on a roof.
[63:48.78]What are you talking about?
[63:54.61]There ain't nobody on a roof.
[64:30.98]I thought you guys were bullshitting me.
[64:32.26]Why would I think there'd be somebody walking around on a roof?
[64:36.06]I'd love to climb the main gate, but I'm sure the police would stop me.
[64:41.99]Yeah, this was a real good quest.
[64:44.03]Is this a wink?
[64:49.87]Worst fucking thing I've ever done in my life is put that on.
[65:01.11]Okay.
[65:01.83]Uhhh... We go to City Hall.
[65:02.83]City Hall.
[65:03.15]We go to City Hall.
[65:11.22]Remove it.
[65:12.46]No, I'm gonna.
[65:13.12]Don't worry.
[65:13.56]I'm gonna give you a date for when it's gonna get removed.
[65:19.72]Imagine paying 75,000 points and getting a half-assed wink.
[65:22.97]I know.
[65:23.59]It's... I know.
[65:25.09]Trust me.
[65:25.53]I'm aware.
[65:26.17]I know.
[65:28.66]that should make 75 000 points okay uh about the hospital's equipment I've been wanting to upgrade the hospital's equipment with the latest models for some time but to do that we need fifteen thousand dollars I can do it you don't have enough money what I don't have any money I don't have enough money
[66:01.47]Alright, I'm gonna go get- I gotta get money.
[66:06.17]Imagine using points and not advertising.
[66:08.79]Nancy Drew.
[66:11.86]Alright, I'm gonna go grind.
[66:14.16]Uh, where's a good grind spot?
[66:15.56]Those, uh... It's a good spot to get, like, quick money.
[66:19.88]That old- that old town place?
[66:25.68]Go to the card and forest dungeon?
[66:33.56]Um, on a pulse that I didn't Mega, I don't mean anything.
[66:36.68]I just want to make sure where I read that.
[66:38.82]Replace Jerma with Bugleberry for the rest of the stream.
[66:42.49]No!
[66:43.41]Why would I do that?
[66:52.43]Didn't, like, title the stream Bugleberry Finishes Mega Man?
[66:57.16]What are you guys trying to do to me?
[66:58.12]Alright, the dungeon here.
[67:15.32]Vacuum for grinding?
[67:16.36]Fuck.
[67:20.47]Too late.
[67:30.05]Save the grocer's wife.
[67:35.52]Fuck.
[67:40.58]Wait, why is this a good grind spot?
[67:44.83]Didn't you play some of that old city better?
[67:46.45]This is not the dungeon.
[67:53.37]This is not a good spot.
[67:58.00]Yeah, they're dead.
[67:59.06]The spots with the, um... Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[68:12.32]Bring the drill in.
[68:13.18]Yeah, I'll equip the drill.
[68:18.43]Uh, let's go, which one, this one downtown?
[68:20.13]Let's, you know, let's go to the one, let's go, I'm here, I'm ready.
[68:25.43]I just need, like, fucking to do it, like, two or three times.
[68:29.80]How much do I donate for a full 60 seconds of Bugleberry?
[68:45.54]I really don't know where I'm supposed to be going next.
[68:50.53]I think, if it were me, and it is me, Blueberry, I would say I would need to go west.
[68:59.53]Oh, it's so scary.
[69:02.09]It's so diabolical going west.
[69:10.04]I will tell you something that I think is important.
[69:14.07]I have not picked up a controller in probably 30 years.
[69:19.09]I don't know anything about video games.
[69:20.75]I don't know what buttons to press.
[69:22.54]Maybe you guys could help me.
[69:24.04]That would be fantastic.
[69:28.82]That was... Oh, I forgot to tell you the price.
[69:31.89]It was five grand.
[69:38.29]100,000 channel points to get a high from Bugleberry.
[69:41.29]No, that's the same thing as a wink.
[69:43.09]It's just more... It's a button I have to press and I have to derail, like... Oh, it's me, Bugleberry.
[69:49.31]Hey, it's me, Bugleberry.
[69:56.01]Hey, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[69:58.49]It's me, Bugleberry.
[70:07.79]A million points?
[70:10.73]Ow, fuck.
[70:14.21]Exposed.
[70:15.97]It's not him.
[70:19.75]Go get the mask.
[70:23.48]No.
[70:25.58]No, I don't want to get the mask and turn the lights down in the room and do Bugleberry.
[70:30.48]No, he's not here.
[70:37.21]What am I doing?
[70:37.97]I keep getting sidetracked.
[70:39.23]Alright, I'm gonna go up.
[70:41.11]No, it's right here.
[70:41.99]There it is.
[70:55.85]Save the Grosha's wife.
[70:58.31]They'll be alright for a little bit.
[70:59.31]I'll be good.
[70:59.65]I just need to get some money.
[71:11.35]I'm going to let Beedleberry scream.
[71:20.73]I'm going to get killed.
[71:25.89]How much are these all worth?
[71:26.79]What are the blue ones actually even worth?
[71:46.68]Oh, what the heck?
[71:49.64]Where- I haven't saved the fucking game, I haven't saved the fucking game, I haven't saved the fucking game, I haven't saved the fucking game.
[71:56.45]I gotta kill this guy first, he's the biggest pain in the ass.
[72:16.07]Explode!
[72:16.65]There we go.
[72:22.23]Alright, good.
[72:25.71]75,000 from Jerma Kiss.
[72:27.23]I don't even know what that means.
[72:36.13]My cat's having a bad dream.
[72:37.29]Can you wish her well?
[72:39.73]No, I wish you not having a bad dream, cat.
[72:49.40]Did it help?
[72:53.31]Did it help?
[73:04.67]This is a pretty good grind spot, you're right.
[73:08.27]Alright, do it again.
[73:10.51]How much money do I have?
[73:11.13]33,000.
[73:11.44]I'm going to do this like five times.
[73:24.61]19,000?
[73:25.37]I'll make it faster with the vacuum.
[73:30.42]Come pick me up.
[73:33.20]Are you sure?
[73:33.78]This is like an $8 lift ride.
[73:36.75]You really want to go down the street?
[73:38.05]Yeah, I guess.
[73:40.33]I don't want to walk.
[73:53.41]Alright, where's my... Not the drill.
[73:55.91]Not the grenade.
[73:56.47]The vacuum.
[74:00.54]Okay.
[74:02.62]Coke versus Pepsi?
[74:04.82]Coke is better.
[74:08.90]Coke is better than Pepsi.
[74:22.46]In fact...
[74:24.28]Most of the Coke products are better than the Pepsi products.
[74:30.28]For instance, Sprite?
[74:31.76]Way better.
[74:48.32]Sprite is the best soda.
[74:51.26]If I could only have one soda for the rest of my life, it would be Sprite.
[75:04.98]Everyone asks for Coke and Sprite, but all you have is Sierra Mist and Pepsi.
[75:08.44]I know, it's like... You know, frankly, it's bullshit.
[75:12.71]I'll be honest.
[75:13.27]Frankly, it's bullshit.
[75:15.05]Can I get a Coke?
[75:16.43]We have Pepsi only.
[75:17.55]Yeah, they made a Super Bowl commercial on it.
[75:19.62]Doesn't that mean that people like Coke more than Pepsi?
[75:30.50]Remember like the Steve Carell commercial?
[75:31.94]Where it was like, is Pepsi okay?
[75:34.30]Is Pepsi okay?
[75:35.26]No, Pepsi's better and it's awesome and of course it's okay!
[75:39.70]Well, I asked for Coke.
[75:41.40]But clearly it's not.
[75:53.31]They're both the same damn thing.
[75:54.91]The only difference is Coke.
[75:56.52]Pepsi is like smoother than Coke.
[75:58.92]Coke is a little harsher.
[76:00.51]I like it like that though.
[76:31.56]Joel bullies Jerma, what?
[76:36.71]I got time for his shit right now.
[76:49.69]Free money, free money, free money, free money, free money, free money, free money.
[76:56.29]Yep.
[76:58.95]Poking the glass is unbeatable.
[77:01.98]Yeah, I would say so.
[77:05.24]Where are you?
[77:13.70]How much plumage for a Bugleberry appearance?
[77:15.98]What if I just did, like, a one-man show, and there was those... You remember those old, like, infomercial kind of commercials?
[77:20.47]Imagine if I advertised for it on TV.
[77:22.95]Like, Bugleberry being there would be, like, a selling point for one of the tickets.
[77:28.20]And don't forget, BF Bugleberry will make his appearance doing his one-man tape on the current horror movies.
[77:35.46]And it's just fucking me in a mask like... For one night only.
[77:45.57]And who could forget Grandpa?
[77:48.27]And just me with a mustache on, like a hat on, like, you know... You're ruining the illusion.
[77:59.81]It'd be me doing the beautiful impression.
[78:16.37]I can't... I mean, these are real people.
[78:18.73]You don't think I have a real grandfather?
[78:21.15]Of course I do.
[78:22.30]And he's been on camera.
[78:34.86]Alright, get me out of the room.
[78:49.28]This way, that way, this way, that way, this way, that way.
[78:54.34]Ever since somebody said that with the auto phase, it's the only thing I can think of.
[79:04.76]Whoa, you came out of nowhere.
[79:12.48]Yo.
[79:16.92]You stormtrooper for the next five minutes?
[79:22.09]What does that mean?
[79:24.31]Wait, you're talking about, like... Is that what you want?
[79:56.23]Is that it?
[79:56.63]No?
[80:01.31]That sounded... That sounded like Obama on a shitty mic.
[80:08.04]Okay, the pitch is down.
[80:19.44]I get you.
[80:21.57]It's a combine.
[80:22.43]Alright, yeah, I see.
[80:27.69]What does it sound like?
[80:29.74]OK.
[80:29.90]Having a hard time playing Mega Man.
[80:36.50]Thought I was doing well.
[80:41.86]But apparently not.
[80:56.08]He just called Obama on the phone.
[81:01.76]I didn't get the money.
[81:08.19]Do pick up that.
[81:12.85]There.
[81:23.01]Oh, there's a shitty Xbox and Microbox.
[81:35.80]Hi.
[81:36.16]Camper with me.
[81:39.30]How many hit markers do I have now?
[81:48.37]This guy's Camper.
[81:49.27]And it's really pissing me off.
[82:03.51]I'm missing money?
[82:04.25]What?
[82:11.32]I have to pay attention to video games.
[82:12.86]I forgot.
[82:23.04]Call Bernie Sanders.
[82:24.32]This is not like the impression.
[82:27.06]Funny impression hour.
[82:28.80]Who cares yet?
[82:30.68]Well, I...
[82:37.32]Call Bernie.
[82:38.12]Oh, let me call Bernie Sanders right now.
[82:39.90]See what he's up to.
[82:49.77]Actually, I know what he's up to.
[82:51.19]He's debating on stage down the street.
[82:56.31]That's where he is.
[83:00.32]They're in Nevada right now.
[83:17.37]How much money do I have?
[83:18.03]Alright, I got enough.
[83:19.13]I got enough.

[84:19.58]It would be like calling out people in chat.
[84:25.93]I just want to say, if we could put it in sub only mode.
[84:31.11]I'm seeing a lot of bullshit over here.
[84:34.13]There's a lot of stuff that I don't like.
[84:44.94]You don't actually know I don't mean that wasn't me Raiding the debate and they have to address it and if they don't address it, it's like yo, whoa I'm not gonna like not gonna mention the raid.

[87:07.73]Yeah, the new percentages you need to be on the stage at the Nevada debate, you need at least 10% in the national poll, or a peak at over 10,000 concurrent viewers on Twitch.
[87:22.39]We've got quite a few people here, actually, from the Twitch side of things.

[93:46.56]Pearl.
[94:15.61]Alright.
[94:20.27]A little more rehabilitation and her leg will be as good as new.
[94:23.36]She can go home then.
[94:24.58]Thank you so much.
[94:27.96]That's what I do.
[94:28.66]I'm Mega Man.
[94:35.70]Finally saved the grocer's wife.
[94:37.30]She's out in a field.
[94:47.84]I don't know where that is.
[94:48.66]I have no idea.
[94:49.84]I don't know where that is.
[94:50.98]Let's see if I can do anything with this.
[95:01.79]I wonder if I got the pots to do anything with this.
[95:14.59]Ooh, Mega Man.
[95:19.89]Gatling part and Flower Pearl were used to make the Buster part Gatling Gun.
[95:31.17]Really?
[95:43.89]Pardon Forest.
[95:45.21]They tell me there's somebody right here.
[95:46.83]1% of streamers, they got all the bits.
[95:53.25]That's cringe, everyone.
[95:54.47]We need to wake up.
[95:55.39]Wake up, America.
[95:56.57]We need to give big bits to the people.
[95:58.58]That's cringe.
[96:03.70]God damn it.
[96:08.14]So walk through the path between the rocks at the flutter.
[96:11.54]The path between the rocks...
[96:13.58]These two rocks?
[96:36.29]Got it!
[96:37.86]I came out here to get some fresh air and look at the scenery, but my stomach, oh, it hurts.
[96:43.02]What do you do?
[96:45.06]Take her to the hospital.
[96:47.98]See if she gets better?
[96:53.18]Anna, are you alright?
[97:01.37]Sorry, but you can't go inside without, you just watched me come in and bring like a sick person.
[97:09.35]Have you come to visit Ira?
[97:10.35]No!
[97:11.07]I... If you're worried about that woman who just came in, she's fine.
[97:20.51]Maybe you should come back after she's calmed down a little.
[97:23.69]Outman.
[97:33.96]Use a JPG instead of a facecam?
[97:35.66]Nah.
[97:38.12]I'm back.
[97:40.27]A new father seems really happy.
[97:42.07]Thanks for your help.
[97:43.83]You're welcome.
[97:44.75]Um... Is that it?
[97:49.06]Have you come to visit Iren?
[97:50.60]No, I came to... Is that it?
[97:52.08]That's it.
[97:56.56]You're the one who helped Anna, aren't you?
[97:58.75]Thank you so much.
[97:59.49]Here, take this as a token of my thanks.
[98:01.37]You got a sunlight.
[98:08.69]Alright.
[98:13.85]But did he just, like, push me outside?
[98:15.41]Get some vitamin D, you little shit!
[98:25.00]Can I do anything with this?
[98:38.94]Nope.
[98:47.53]Okay.
[98:49.39]Alright.
[98:50.57]It's time.
[98:51.29]It's time to go to the main gate.
[98:54.53]It's time.
[98:54.95]We're gonna put on the gatling gun.
[99:02.16]We're here.
[99:03.18]Okay.
[99:07.84]Cluster parts.
[99:09.86]Equip.
[99:11.16]The gatling gun.
[99:12.32]So this is attack four.
[99:13.66]Gatling gun is...
[99:16.19]one attack one range and four energy no I think what I had on was the best thing I can do
[99:44.04]It's just a ton of attack and a ton of... I can just spam with the max attack.
[99:57.09]The only thing I do... I mean, I only have Rapid.
[99:59.01]I'm surprised this is not Rapid.
[100:03.41]How could it be Gatling Gun if it's just... Yeah, I'll keep what I had on.
[100:16.43]I have to put... I'm gonna spend the rest of my money.
[100:23.38]We have to go downtown first.
[100:27.88]We gotta refill the canteen.
[100:29.16]Buy a couple more things.
[100:33.53]And that's it.
[100:36.59]Try it.
[100:37.01]Please try it.
[100:37.69]Try it.
[100:37.91]Try it.
[100:38.19]What?
[100:38.29]What?
[100:49.77]Is that north?
[100:50.29]Fuuuuck.
[100:55.72]Yeah, I went to the museum.
[100:58.78]I'm still missing a couple items, though.
[100:59.78]Hope you have a wonderful day.
[101:04.86]See you later.
[101:05.28]Hope you have a wonderful day, too.
[101:06.40]Thanks.
[101:06.64]That's really nice of you to say that.
[101:08.37]Refill canteen.
[101:18.19]Alright.
[101:18.99]Bye.
[101:24.99]This Kevlar jacket is 120.
[101:26.41]Butt.
[101:30.23]Fuck it.
[101:33.40]Blasted unit.
[101:35.72]Range.
[101:37.12]Turbo battery.
[101:38.22]Is there any rapid?
[101:44.26]No.
[101:47.26]Blasted unit omega.
[101:49.16]Is that 2 and 3?
[101:50.56]That's kind of okay, but...
[102:00.80]Is it maxed out?
[102:04.25]I'll get the comm- Did I get the shield?
[102:07.31]The invinci- I'm gonna get the invulnerability shield.
[102:10.19]And the comm- Just get all these things.
[102:11.39]I'll figure out what the fuck they do.
[102:13.49]Alright, I'm gonna sell some stuff.
[102:17.52]Sell.
[102:21.36]Oh my god.
[102:22.16]No, I'm using all these.
[102:36.60]I don't think I'm going to use these ever.
[102:38.09]I really don't think I'm going to put at least these... Maybe the gatling gun.
[102:49.49]Maybe.
[102:49.87]I don't know.
[102:50.33]I have no idea.
[102:51.55]What about items?
[102:54.11]Anything worth a lot of money?
[102:58.55]Can I get a hit of your jewel, please?
[103:03.73]Um...
[103:06.11]What the fuck are you talking about?
[103:17.54]Don't do that shit.
[103:20.10]Alright, time to save the game.
[103:24.32]Not yet.
[103:24.68]We do special weapons.
[103:29.04]Change weapon.
[103:31.44]I'm gonna, what should I put on?
[103:33.04]Active Buster, I think it's what I've upgraded the most.
[103:35.94]Active Buster.
[103:37.55]And we're gonna enhance it.
[103:38.35]Do I have enough money to do anything with it?
[103:40.13]I have 14,000.
[103:40.45]Nope.
[103:40.99]Blow, blow, please, please blow.
[103:51.52]What?
[103:51.84]Please?
[103:52.54]Bro, please, please, bro.
[103:56.96]Do a five-second review of Overwatch.
[103:59.48]The game was fun for six months, and I never played it again.
[104:03.28]That's it.
[104:03.60]Okay, save again.
[104:28.67]Rick and Morty impressions.
[104:36.46]No, that's not going to happen.
[104:37.70]I don't know if the new episode came out yet.
[104:42.86]They're half season, right?
[105:11.56]oh try gatling gun try gatling gun try gatling gun so let's go let's take off auto battery and put on gatling gun as you can see it's not doing very much
[105:33.75]It was better having the auto battery on.
[105:40.40]But I have max energy.
[105:50.00]I can just spin.
[105:50.58]I can hold it down the whole time.
[105:53.38]Alright, let's go to the room.
[105:54.32]I have to go to... It's all the way down.
[106:02.34]Wish I had the Kevlar right now, but I don't.
[106:05.10]Oh, I'm so fucking nervous.
[106:12.00]Is this a screensaver room?
[106:17.55]Or, I mean, we've given this a couple of names.
[106:20.85]This also could be potential virus... Why can't I say ours today?
[106:26.83]Potential virus... The joke is ruined.
[106:29.94]Potential virus...
[106:33.39]shareware FPS game made by one person in like 1996 and if I said it correctly the first time maybe it would have been humorous
[106:58.74]What did I... I said shareware.
[107:01.36]Shareware.
[107:02.64]Shareware.
[107:12.77]What?
[107:13.29]And now I have... now my shield's gone.
[107:22.53]What?
[107:24.30]He's devolving.
[107:26.18]Sheer weird.
[107:27.34]I have an accent sometimes.
[107:29.31]You know, everybody doesn't talk the same way.
[107:37.04]There's different places that have different accents.
[107:41.62]Nobody talks the same way.
[108:07.35]Come on!
[108:09.19]Build it!
[108:09.77]Build it!
[108:11.21]How do I activate that super shield?
[108:12.87]Is it a good level design?
[108:15.53]I know it's not.
[108:17.41]I'm sorry.
[108:18.23]I'm showing you this bad level design.
[108:27.59]Why is it so bright?
[108:28.85]It's part of the way the game gets captured through this upscaler.
[108:31.83]Alright, here we go.
[108:35.36]This is it, right?
[108:39.26]There's some writing.
[108:41.82]Watcher.
[108:43.44]What is that supposed to mean?
[108:50.52]It's just labeled, Mega Man.
[108:52.24]The second door.
[108:54.40]What is this?
[108:56.48]It reads... Sleeper.
[109:04.77]The third door.
[109:06.67]What does this one say?
[109:09.34]dreamer well it should be the last one oh here comes the great the big reveal of the game what's happening to me this is the first time I've ever been here but I feel like I've seen this before
[109:35.48]Something is telling me there's danger here, that it shouldn't be opened.
[109:38.80]Uh-oh.
[109:41.00]It's a man?
[109:48.59]A person?
[110:05.48]Sephiroth?
[110:07.36]Was it you who awoke me?
[110:10.57]It is somewhat earlier than I had planned, but no matter.
[110:16.03]Thank you for awakening me.
[110:20.40]Have we met before?
[110:22.56]Oh, please forgive me.
[110:24.54]You are a purifier model, assigned to the direct command of Mother.
[110:28.50]Team Rocket?
[110:29.66]You are designated Mega Man Trigger.
[110:32.11]Please forgive me.
[110:33.33]I did not recognize you in your current configuration.
[110:38.01]You... you know me?
[110:40.97]You don't remember?
[110:41.75]Ah, I see.
[110:45.32]You have suffered memory loss, yes?
[110:47.70]Then for what purpose have you awakened me?
[110:51.68]I assume... I'm gonna kill you myself, that's why.
[110:57.18]...that your reason for coming here is to purge the carbons that have over-propagated during the time I was inactive.
[111:04.44]Carbons?
[111:05.84]Purge?
[111:07.17]What are you talking about?
[111:09.36]According to Urban Military Security Ordinance A10, the number of carbon units is not allowed to increase beyond the pre-specified limit.
[111:17.41]If this happens, they are to be purged immediately.
[111:20.43]My observation, if left unattended, the carbons will reproduce indefinitely.
[111:25.43]Their numbers will grow, polluting the surface world.
[111:28.30]They can be quite a nuisance.
[111:29.74]Carbons?
[111:31.26]Do you mean the people on the island?
[111:34.58]The carbons fit mass population model B. They are unstable.
[111:39.25]Very difficult to control.
[111:41.09]Perhaps it would be better to simply... re-initialize.
[111:44.79]Re-initialize?
[111:45.75]No, I haven't understood much of what you've been saying.
[111:48.25]But, when you say re-initialize, do you mean... No!
[111:51.49]No, you don't.
[111:53.39]No, no, the universe is finite.
[111:54.93]This resource is finite.
[111:55.71]Jesus!
[111:55.91]This is quite reprehensible.
[112:01.73]It would be much simpler if I had the assistance of a proficient unit, such as yourself.
[112:06.38]Once my task is complete, I shall inquire as to the presence of a backup of your memory on Aiden.
[112:11.62]Alright, alright, Noma, can we get the, stop Noma flashing, please?
[112:14.75]Yes, until then.
[112:15.87]What?
[112:17.15]Oh, this hurts.
[112:19.25]I'm about to press a button.
[112:29.59]Did you hear that, Teasel?
[112:32.05]Yep.
[112:32.75]Something tells me he's not kidding either.
[112:35.31]I really think he plans to kill everyone on the island.
[112:40.33]Teasel, we've got to do something.
[112:42.19]We've got to stop him.
[112:44.45]Hmm.
[112:45.11]That's easier said than done.
[112:47.40]Besides, do you think we could beat him?
[112:51.00]Well, um... What about Mega Man?
[112:57.68]don't like it but I can't think of anything better so oh here's a problem ah how do you stop this thing thank you oh shit pirate thanks for your help
[113:27.72]Come on, hurry up!
[113:28.76]He's getting away!
[113:32.34]Right.
[113:34.68]It's not over between you and me.
[113:36.76]I won't forgive you if you die or anything stupid like that, so be careful in there, okay?
[113:43.73]Right.
[113:44.87]See you later.
[113:51.09]Don't worry, Tron.
[113:52.45]If anyone can do it, he can.
[113:56.23]I know.
[113:57.28]Don't die, you stupid fucking idiot.
[113:59.10]I haven't even got a chance to play.
[114:00.39]I'm gonna get healed.
[114:14.21]Just relax.
[114:22.09]Ooh.
[114:26.38]Mega Man dies from the first enemy.
[114:28.10]Power stream.
[114:32.92]He's still giving me items?
[114:33.96]Isn't this like the final portion of the whole game?
[114:37.30]Oh shit, a golden crab.
[114:49.30]Is it a buster part?
[114:52.58]Oh fuck, it is.
[114:53.60]Alright, laser is plus four attack.
[114:58.07]Maxes out attack.
[115:00.69]Alright, hold on a second here.
[115:02.70]Maxed attack, maxed energy.
[115:04.14]That means I don't need this anymore.
[115:11.36]Energy and rapid?
[115:13.92]No, no, I don't need any.
[115:14.70]I'm looking for range and rapid.
[115:16.35]Do I have any range and rapid?
[115:22.23]No range, no rapid.
[115:24.29]Energy, range, attack and range.
[115:28.92]Attack, range, and energy.
[115:29.92]No, I don't need that.
[115:31.10]I have rapid 2.
[115:36.98]Is rapid 2 better than range and rapid 1?
[115:38.86]Let's see.
[115:50.19]I lose range, though.
[115:51.17]Okay, that's pretty good.
[115:59.38]Gatling gun, laser.
[116:00.46]No, there's nothing else down here.
[116:07.37]Damn.
[116:08.45]No range in Ra.
[116:10.09]Are we sure?
[116:11.27]Range, sniper scope.
[116:17.04]I mean, that's just a... It's all range.
[116:19.02]Let me see what this does.
[116:24.48]Range and... A little bit more range and then...
[116:31.63]I'll do this for now.
[116:36.36]No.
[116:37.04]You're right.
[116:37.40]I'm going to need the range.
[116:41.71]I'm going to need the range.
[116:44.61]Might as well take it if it's for free.
[116:59.86]Well, appreciate the spoiler, because that means I can take this off.
[117:07.06]And what's this going to do?
[117:07.84]Rapid, too.
[117:15.33]Or is it... Rapid Striker?
[117:25.75]Oh, this range might be bad.
[117:26.93]Oh, well.
[117:29.50]Fuck it.
[117:33.06]I have a plus three rapid?
[117:34.34]Did I?
[117:38.68]Is this the room?
[117:41.88]You can feel tremendous energy emanating from the refractor.
[117:49.90]It's being held in place by some kind of powerful force.
[117:52.86]It appears as if the entire main gate is under the control of Mega Man Juno.
[117:59.54]Who am I?
[118:04.24]Mega Man Volnaut, right?
[118:16.84]Well, looks like we're going this way.
[118:24.91]Mega Man Juno versus Mega Man Volnaut.
[118:28.78]His name is much cooler than mine.
[118:31.17]This is a bright area.
[118:32.63]I can't even see.
[118:48.22]Dentist hallway?
[118:49.14]Yeah, pretty much.
[118:51.10]Uh-oh.
[118:52.66]Enemies.
[119:01.33]What's the point of this room?
[119:06.51]No, what's the point of this room?
[119:07.33]Like, why would you put that there?
[119:08.40]I'm fuckin' pissed.
[119:09.06]I'm fuckin' pissed at this fuckin' idiot game.
[119:25.49]Just put in some maze?
[119:27.97]Oh!
[119:31.05]Well, I haven't gone this way.
[119:41.50]Well, I found the door.
[119:44.48]Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?
[119:47.18]It would have been nice if we could have just kept on living in peace with Professor and Ro.
[119:52.12]But I guess we gotta do what we gotta do, right?
[119:54.96]Mega Man Juno's waiting for you inside.
[120:05.50]A fucking cringed monkey.
[120:07.22]I'm not done exploring.
[120:34.67]Tell me lore?
[120:36.19]What lore do you want me to tell you?
[120:46.58]I'm not done exploring.
[120:50.38]No, I'm not.
[120:51.24]I'm not done.
[120:52.16]Look down there.
[120:52.69]There's probably a secret enemy.
[120:54.43]There's not.
[121:03.33]No holes or anything?
[121:09.37]Well, what the fuck?
[121:15.93]Alright, let's go.
[121:23.52]It's the end game.
[121:24.64]I know, but I would think there would be some fun.
[121:29.15]Didn't 100% the game.
[121:29.63]Too bad, I know.
[121:39.36]Well, you may not know anything about Juno, but judging from his model type, I'd say that your combat capabilities exceed his.
[121:56.62]Juno wasn't designed for combat, but still, as master of the island, you shouldn't underestimate him.
[122:02.26]Your relative levels of strength depend on how much you've developed your capabilities in weapons.
[122:08.26]This is the real villain.
[122:10.24]This is the real villain.
[122:33.65]I knew it was gonna, I should have said it.
[122:35.79]I was thinking it, but I didn't say it.
[122:37.07]I knew it was gonna be like a fucking organ, and I didn't say it, and it would have been perfect.
[122:40.93]It appears I miscalculated the odds of your ability to escape that trap.
[122:45.67]Shit.
[122:46.60]I was gonna say it too.
[122:48.06]You are, however, too late.
[122:51.64]Eden was activated as soon as I entered this room.
[122:56.72]It cannot be deactivated as long as I, the master key of this island, remain here in this control room.
[123:05.29]a lot of trash out in space all that remains now is to wait for eden to enter transmission range and send the command to execute the reinitialization of this island once that command is received the 10 000 workers aboard aiden will execute it immediately my estimates indicate their work will be completed in less than five minutes
[123:30.93]I said trump voice.
[123:31.98]It doesn't sound like trump at all not even close Uh, we stopped this right
[123:53.50]Thank you.
[124:12.91]Now that Eden has been activated, any further interference from you will remain on file, thus tarnishing my operating record.
[124:20.87]Fortunately, you are suffering from memory loss and fragmentation.
[124:25.35]Therefore, as keeper of this island, I hereby exercise my prerogative of correctional dispensation.
[124:31.97]Prerogative?
[124:33.13]Of correctional?
[124:34.81]What?
[124:35.55]Allow me to rephrase.
[124:37.69]I will exercise my authority to terminate your program.
[124:43.03]Begin!
[124:46.65]That hurts.
[124:51.19]Oh, that hurt a lot.
[124:58.12]Oh!
[124:58.82]Oh!
[125:18.30]Not a combat model.
[125:19.56]Yeah, what the fuck are you talking about?
[125:25.34]Don't I have like invincibility?
[125:30.26]How do I turn on invincibility mode?
[125:47.65]Oi!
[125:47.87]What the fuck is he?
[125:55.84]What the fuck?
[126:15.32]It's a fucking L1R1 to turn the camera.
[126:18.34]It's just like... I may as well fucking put a blindfold on.
[126:30.18]I'm killing him.
[126:39.25]Don't worry.
[126:44.86]Yeah, I chose that setting because the other one was way worse.
[126:48.31]The other one, you can't strafe.
[126:51.71]Strafing doesn't exist if I turn the other one on, which sucks.
[127:07.39]Ready?
[127:13.68]How about this?
[127:16.29]Oh, come on.
[127:25.23]Ready?
[127:29.32]Ah!
[127:33.30]Oh, what a pain in the absolute ass this actually is.
[127:41.25]Oh, shit!
[127:41.97]Is that the death?
[127:46.89]It's just puke control.
[127:53.86]The whole world got... The quick turn is hard to do because it's down in circles and sometimes it doesn't do anything.
[128:09.60]By the time you turn around, you have to- he's already gone, so I have to hold R1 to, like, and then walk forward.
[128:21.46]I can't increase the sensitivity on that fucking Ernie.
[128:24.14]It's not gonna happen.
[128:47.07]Ready?
[128:49.65]Ready?
[128:50.73]Ready?
[129:16.83]Ready?
[129:23.19]Ready?
[129:29.67]Oh, fuck you, game.
[129:30.51]How cool.
[129:32.46]Defend yourself.
[129:34.92]How cool.
[129:56.98]Somebody said that in chat.
[130:05.82]I thought you were making fun of me, but it's what a line he says.
[130:12.23]Ready?
[130:18.58]Turn, turn around.
[130:26.54]Turn the fuck around.
[130:34.91]What?
[130:47.95]What the fuck is that move?
[130:52.02]Deal.
[130:59.66]He's got a new attack, this motherfucker.
[131:19.26]Oh, I forgot!
[131:20.32]What?!
[131:20.42]I jumped over it!
[131:23.78]Ready?
[131:23.94]How was that?
[131:55.11]AHH!
[132:19.65]I don't even know who the fuck he is!
[132:37.64]Yeah, ready for you to die.
[132:51.12]How was that?
[132:53.24]No choke, no choke, no choke, no choke.
[132:55.34]I can't even turn the fucking camera.
[132:56.20]I can't even turn the camera.
[132:56.80]I can't even turn the camera.
[132:59.14]My, my.
[133:00.70]It would appear that I have made an error.
[133:14.57]No!
[133:15.97]You were nearly successful in terminating my... Oh, shit.
[133:20.29]But do not be disappointed.
[133:22.45]It appears it will take longer than anticipated for Eden to reach its optimal altitude.
[133:26.75]Really?
[133:27.15]It's delayed?
[133:27.71]If you can terminate Eden before then, you will be able to stop it.
[133:32.30]Assuming you are capable of deactivating it.
[133:34.96]He's gonna plug into a big thing.
[133:37.52]What?!
[133:38.64]He's plugging into the ceiling and he's gonna turn into a giant thing.
[133:41.32]He's gonna turn into a key and unlock the door and behind the door is gonna be something huge.
[133:48.20]Yeah, of course there is.
[133:49.60]Why wouldn't there be?
[133:52.48]Are you ready?
[133:54.68]No.
[133:55.88]Are you ready?
[134:35.43]Are you ready?
[134:57.32]Aye!
[135:18.66]Wait a minute.
[135:20.36]Wait a minute.
[135:27.73]Turned!
[135:29.11]What?! !
[135:58.23]What is this movie doing now?
[136:06.36]What the fuck is this move?
[136:07.94]Shield repair.
[136:10.22]Okay, now go invisible.
[136:16.35]And... Recharge special weapon.
[136:22.85]Alright, let's go.
[136:26.23]Can't see shit.
[136:27.01]Can't see doesn't know where I am.
[137:02.21]I thought I had the shield fixed.
[137:07.27]I thought I've repaired the shield and I could take another hit.
[137:16.85]I killed you even with that.
[137:18.07]Alright.
[137:22.57]Is it because I got hit twice?
[137:24.51]I don't even have that Kevlar, you're right.
[137:26.05]Fuck.
[137:28.13]It's not good.
[137:35.32]Damn.
[137:36.14]Alright.
[137:40.96]Let me try it again.
[137:41.62]Okay.
[138:00.34]Wow.
[138:25.68]Please I'll get gritty Oh
[138:49.48]This camera makes me want to throw up in my mouth.
[138:53.77]Turn the fucking camera game.
[138:55.85]Oh, he's getting actually mad.
[138:57.39]Actually mad.
[138:58.99]Actually mad.
[138:59.85]What the hell was that?
[139:18.31]What was that?
[139:21.33]Defend yourself.
[139:23.17]This moves around so quickly, and I can't turn.
[139:39.77]What was that?
[139:41.03]Fasten it.
[139:41.84]Like, fuck you.
[139:42.56]How about this?
[139:52.08]I might have to go get the vest.
[139:54.96]I do have a full heal, but I don't want to use it yet.
[140:13.60]Defend yourself.
[140:17.72]Defend yourself.
[140:23.48]Oh shit.
[140:30.18]Where is he?
[140:30.80]Oh god.
[140:31.76]You fucking gotta be kidding me, you piece of shit.
[140:37.46]Like, fuck that.
[140:42.75]Get these fucking things off, by the way.
[140:45.47]Where's the jump?
[140:46.53]Get these off.
[140:47.89]Get them out of here.
[140:52.18]I like just moon shoes up into the air.
[140:54.20]Here we go.
[141:21.92]Don't skip.
[141:23.77]Uh-oh.
[141:24.97]Put them back on.
[141:25.61]Put them back on.
[141:26.23]Put them back on.
[141:26.85]Put them back on.
[141:27.47]Put them back on.
[141:28.21]Put these back on.
[141:29.35]They're very useful.
[141:31.07]Incredibly useful.
[141:32.51]Because now I... Uh-oh.
[141:35.68]Oh.
[141:54.69]Are you ready?
[141:58.30]Are you ready?
[141:59.38]Oh, I'm not.
[142:44.04]Now jump at me.
[142:47.65]Alright.
[142:48.37]Jump now and then jump again.
[142:50.29]Here comes the lightning.
[142:51.49]Oh.
[142:53.28]I'm getting Geno flashed.
[143:09.19]God damn it, I'm trying to fucking... God damn camera.
[143:13.31]Fuck this camera.
[143:21.99]Oh my...
[143:38.42]You don't understand.
[143:41.18]Moving around sucks in this game.
[143:44.68]He's doing it again.
[143:45.54]Don't kill me please!
[144:10.22]Step on his head.
[144:14.53]It appears I was in error assuming that a bureaucratic model such as myself would be able to best you in hand-to-hand combat.
[144:20.33]However, I was successful in keeping you occupied long enough for Aiden to achieve optimal altitude before you could interfere.
[144:25.88]Pick this guy up and penalty soccer ball throw him into space.
[144:30.82]Just watch him, like, crystallize while you go back to home.
[144:42.44]This is Mega Man Juno, bureaucratic model third class.
[144:46.62]Authorization number 8677.
[144:49.64]Requesting a reinitialization of this island's systems and a memory backup of its bureaucratic systems.
[144:55.54]I wasn't fast enough?
[144:57.34]Stop!
[144:58.14]Stop it!
[144:59.70]If you wish to shoot me, please do not hesitate.
[145:03.35]My program has already been backed up in Eden's central core.
[145:14.70]I eagerly await my next activation.
[145:34.76]Juno complete.
[145:36.86]Execution of Catalog's re-initialization program will commence in 100 seconds.
[145:43.63]What should I do?
[145:44.67]Interrupt command.
[145:47.97]Priority command rerouted to Purify First Class Megaman Trigger.
[145:51.59]Tronbone!
[145:52.17]What?
[145:52.81]Under suspicion of malfunction, bureaucratic model Third Class Juno has been deactivated by Megaman Trigger.
[145:59.67]Voice reveal.
[146:00.03]As for ordinance 103.
[146:03.71]Mega Man Trigger hereby requests the indefinite postponement of the previous re-initialization order and the deletion of bureaucratic model Juno's backup data.
[146:13.68]Trigger hereby assumes all bureaucratic authority for the district and will petition Mother for guidance at a future date.
[146:20.78]Command, re-route acknowledged.
[146:23.16]Priority given to... What just happened?
[146:25.76]Eden resuming standby mode and returning to predesignated coordinates.
[146:32.51]Deleting log of Purifier First Class's correspondence as required by security ordinances.
[146:38.63]Requesting that notification to Mother be carried out by Purifier First Class, present bureaucratic authority, Trigger.
[147:02.79]There's nothing to worry about anymore, Mega Man.
[147:06.51]Everything should return to normal shortly.
[147:10.73]Do you know who I am?
[147:13.96]I'm your peripheral memory storage device.
[147:18.04]You originally created me so your memory couldn't be scanned by Mother 2.
[147:25.02]I can't tell you anything yet.
[147:28.60]But soon I'll be able to tell you everything.
[147:32.72]What you are, why you lost your memory, your original function, and mission.
[147:41.29]Mega Man!
[147:42.85]Mega Man!
[147:43.85]Blasted contraption.
[147:48.14]Mega Man Legends 2.
[147:50.86]Mega Man, are you alright?
[147:52.34]Yep, I'm just fine.
[147:54.00]Gramps and I were working on the radio forever, but couldn't get it to work.
[147:58.25]Mega Man, you won't believe what we saw.
[148:01.05]I'm glad these old eyes of mine lasted long enough to see it.
[148:04.91]Calm down, Gramps.
[148:07.21]He's been like this ever since... Huh?
[148:10.83]Mega Man?
[148:11.90]Are you alright?
[148:13.16]Oh, it's nothing, really.
[148:15.92]I'm sorry that I scared you.
[148:17.95]You're always running off like that, making me worry myself sick over you.
[148:23.06]But somehow, I know you'll always make it back.
[148:28.06]I have faith in you.
[148:31.82]Thanks.
[148:32.94]See you soon.
[148:35.90]Data, let's go.
[148:36.84]E-E!
[148:38.62]Why didn't they do an E-E?
[148:42.13]Ready, Mega Man?
[148:44.05]That's the hold R1 to turn sound.
[148:50.65]I knew this game was sentient.
[149:09.27]Alright, we're ready to go anytime you are.
[149:11.77]Thanks, Rolf.
[149:13.65]Why do we hate the monkey so much?
[149:16.48]What is going on?
[149:35.81]Now that we've got a refractor for the flutter, it's time for us to go.
[149:39.66]If you must go, won't you at least come to town and say goodbye to everyone?
[149:46.56]I suppose we should at least say goodbye, eh?
[149:50.90]Hey, Mega Man, why don't you go?
[149:53.55]Give him our best.
[149:55.13]It would mean so much to everyone.
[149:58.15]Go on, Mega Man, and say goodbye to the junkman's wife for me.
[150:02.47]Okay, I'm going.
[150:17.20]I can't just leave?
[150:22.36]The door is not open.
[150:25.26]Alright, let's go say bye to everybody.
[150:30.91]We're gonna say our final- we're gonna say our bye to Tron Bon.
[150:43.31]Am I going to play Legends 2?
[150:44.51]Yes, I have it right behind me.
[150:46.95]Not immediately, though.
[150:47.79]We've got some stuff going on.
[150:53.69]If I'd known you were a hero like that, I would have played with you more.
[150:57.06]Cool.
[150:59.70]I'm going to say bye to the junk.
[151:06.54]What about the Misadventures of Tron Bone?
[151:08.28]Um...
[151:10.29]You really have to go, hippopotamus.
[151:12.79]You're the best digger we've ever had.
[151:15.94]I'm sure you'll do fine wherever you go.
[151:18.20]You and your spotter roll.
[151:22.06]You two seem to get along real well, like a digger and spotter should.
[151:27.46]You did it, Hippopotamus.
[151:29.34]Now I'll be able to dig all over the island.
[151:31.40]Just kidding.
[151:31.96]I think I'll stick with the little ruins near the city.
[151:35.52]I mean, there's still all sorts of Reaverbots in other ruins, right?
[151:39.70]Anyway, take care of yourself.
[151:45.46]Goodbye.
[151:49.15]Chat, you're so funny.
[151:50.43]It gets funnier every single time.
[152:04.81]Like, wow.
[152:20.10]Cringe community.
[152:24.18]Eh, yes.
[152:25.78]Yeah, cut this shit.
[152:27.38]You know, come on.
[152:28.95]What the fuck.
[152:34.20]Megaman, can you hear me?
[152:42.82]We'll be taking off soon.
[152:43.72]Don't go too far.
[152:44.58]Didn't you tell me to go say bye to everybody?
[152:45.86]I can't even say bye to the hospital.
[152:55.11]Um, the kid in the hospital.
[152:57.01]Dude, you going to cringe con this year?
[153:12.32]So what was the point of me doing this?
[153:14.24]Why did I even do this?
[153:17.36]I can't say bye to anybody.
[153:21.84]Talk to the people?
[153:22.56]Well, I did.
[153:24.26]Thanks for everything, Mega Man.
[153:25.70]They all said the same thing.
[153:26.50]Come play with Paprika.
[153:31.63]Woof, woof, woof.
[153:33.05]Good luck, Mega Man!
[153:34.09]Talk and talk?
[153:42.19]Oh, hi Mega Man.
[153:43.51]Thanks for your help.
[153:45.17]Did you hear we had a baby boy?
[153:46.97]We named him Mega Man after you.
[154:07.88]Thank you so much for saving me and my baby.
[154:10.96]And the island, huh?
[154:12.06]Oh, the baby's just fine.
[154:13.22]Thank you.
[154:14.30]I'm doing great, too, as you can see.
[154:15.66]The hospital girl's in the town.
[154:35.77]Oh, what about the inspector?
[154:36.97]This is the first character we saw.
[154:38.67]Mega Man, it's you leaving, are you?
[154:40.75]We may have lived through the great disaster and all the trouble with the pirates, but once you're gone, we'll have to take care of everything ourselves again.
[154:47.55]We're going to have a rough time of it after you leave.
[154:50.90]Well, take care of yourself, okay?
[154:53.20]That's a way to lay it on me.
[154:54.52]Alright, where's the...
[155:03.90]This is the painter.
[155:04.48]Well, good luck to the both of us, eh?
[155:06.90]It's the reporter.
[155:07.52]Hey!
[155:32.12]Hi Mega Man, thank you so much for everything you've done for me and everyone.
[155:36.20]You know what?
[155:36.78]I've decided that once I get out of the hospital, I'm going to learn how to be a digger just like you.
[155:42.68]Promise me that when I grow up, you'll take me with you on one of your digs, okay?
[155:49.29]There, we said bye.
[155:49.91]And then I just like fucking feel out.
[156:09.69]The hospital?
[156:10.45]Yeah, she was in the hospital.
[156:18.14]Alright, well, they're too far away.
[156:19.34]I don't care.
[156:25.48]Remember... Wait, what?
[156:29.12]Alright, goodbye, everybody.
[156:30.30]It's been fun.
[156:36.36]Thanks for letting me hang out.
[156:41.94]Please practice safer driving habits.
[156:45.81]Out of the 17 citizens, at least 8 of you ran me over with a car.
[156:51.21]So... Please.
[156:57.56]You should tell Role you're ready to go.
[156:58.90]I'm gonna do it fucking cool if I'm gonna do it.
[157:06.24]Time to go then.
[157:07.48]Yes.
[157:09.37]Thank you so much for your help.
[157:13.13]Take care of yourselves.
[157:14.89]Bye.
[157:15.37]Take care.
[157:15.99]Goodbye.
[157:16.73]See you later, Amelia.
[157:21.55]Key!
[157:23.59]Key?
[157:23.71]Why is the monkey talking now?
[157:25.69]The monkey just makes noises.
[157:26.91]Goodbye.
[157:28.15]Give me a yearbook quote.
[157:55.15]After all that, we still didn't find out anything about your mom and dad.
[158:00.39]Or the Motherlode.
[158:01.53]Well, it can't be helped.
[158:04.27]It's not like we meant to come here in the first place, right?
[158:07.64]But everything worked out in the end, right?
[158:10.42]Yeah.
[158:12.04]Hey, Mega Man, did something happen while you were underground?
[158:16.30]Huh?
[158:17.08]Yeah.
[158:17.78]Well, not really.
[158:19.00]Don't worry about it.
[158:21.10]Well, I don't know, but... Don't ever forget that I'll always believe in you.
[158:28.14]Aww, will you?
[158:29.84]That's sweet.
[158:31.84]Mega Man, roll!
[158:33.56]Look outside!
[158:35.00]The island!
[158:36.82]Mega Man?
[158:37.86]Okay.
[158:40.91]What is it?
[158:42.87]Whoa!
[158:43.97]Roll left!
[158:45.05]Left!
[158:46.19]Huh?
[158:46.70]Okay.
[158:50.63]That's the town!
[158:51.57]I hope those of you at home are watching.
[159:04.21]Our brave heroes are taking off, heading for new adventures.
[159:08.86]A yearbook quote right there.
[159:12.78]Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.
[159:24.15]I lost chat somehow.
[159:27.35]I have no idea what anyone's saying.
[159:31.37]Uh, what, that one's not good enough?
[159:58.55]Uh, how about, um, let me think.
[160:01.51]Good one.
[160:07.97]Uh... How about, um... Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.
[160:25.02]That's pretty good.
[160:25.58]I just came up with that.
[160:35.35]Here comes some rock music.
[160:36.52]How about fall seven times and stand up eight?
[160:40.16]That's... Oh, I beat the game.
[160:42.24]Cool.
[161:00.70]He's plagiarized.
[161:02.80]I'm reading, like, quotes from famous people.
[161:05.18]What do you want me to do?
[161:06.67]Why do you want a yearbook quote from me?
[161:09.85]Alright, I'll give you one.
[161:10.83]You ready?
[161:11.21]Uh, I don't know.
[161:14.37]Win or lose, hit the snooze.
[161:18.81]Being well-rested is more important than... Win or lose, hit the snooze.
[161:26.26]That's it.
[161:33.85]Your body needs fuckin' rest.
[161:34.81]Sour, please.
[161:57.43]I'm going to fire up the engine, Mega Man.
[161:59.55]You grab that blue lever there.
[162:01.39]Gotcha.
[162:01.82]What's with this tone?
[162:02.76]Three, two, one!
[162:05.64]Mega Man, now!
[162:07.00]Here goes!
[162:09.70]It worked!
[162:13.00]Up and away!
[162:16.72]Let's go!
[162:20.33]That's it!
[162:22.23]This is a really good theatrical play song.
[162:29.30]I can see them all jumping around and swinging their arms up and flying down and stuff on stage.
[162:37.06]And each time another person talks, the spotlight goes on them, and the other two, it's not on them.
[162:41.50]No more playing around!
[162:48.80]I'll show them!
[163:00.71]Alright, that's it.
[163:01.47]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[163:03.87]For Black and White 2.
[163:13.52]Is there an after-credits scene?
[163:14.66]Maybe?
[163:14.96]I don't know.
[163:15.24]I don't think there is.
[163:16.95]Probably not.
[163:24.83]The return of Murius?
[163:25.91]Yes.
[163:27.93]Murius is returning.
[163:30.65]That is the plan tomorrow, Black and White 2, Murius Returns.
[163:38.47]But time tomorrow.
[163:39.69]Tomorrow at 2 p.m.
[163:41.67]Pacific time.
[163:44.33]Hope to see you there.
[163:44.97]This is Mega Man Jr.
[163:50.36]Geocratic Model Geoclass.
[163:52.40]Authorization number 8677.
[163:55.34]Requesting a re-initialization of this island's systems and a memory backup of Geoclass.
[164:06.77]There is active credits?
[164:07.61]Alright, we'll just wait.
[164:09.11]We'll hang up.
[164:09.51]I could do some of the bits.
[164:10.63]While we have, yeah, I'll do the bits while we wait.
[164:13.52]Hey, it's nice everything thanks to the five, uh, not community, so it's five dollars, 500 bits.
[164:32.88]Would you... The female version... Um, no.
[164:39.87]Thanks for the $5.
[164:40.41]Why would I even answer this question?
[164:47.12]Thank you for the 500 bits.
[164:48.00]Appreciate it.
[164:50.38]Hey, Nearshoe, thanks for 10 community subs.
[164:54.96]Thank you, Nearshoe.
[164:55.64]I think we caught it early, but thanks.
[165:00.53]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[165:04.95]Oh, that's right.
[165:08.79]I forgot because I've raided the League of Legends channels for a joke.
[165:14.02]It just- League of Legends is always hosting someone.
[165:17.12]So the host never turned up until like yesterday night, like last night.
[165:24.62]I forgot about that.
[165:27.60]It was like a three-day host.
[165:32.34]After credits.
[165:36.63]There is.
[165:49.63]There they go.
[165:51.26]Not a care in the world.
[165:53.26]Hey, Tron, can't this thing go any faster?
[165:57.66]No, it can't.
[165:59.14]I had to gather up all the spare parts from everything he blew up to build this.
[166:04.55]That's right, that's right.
[166:06.43]We'll just have to rough it until we get to the next island.
[166:09.65]If we sell what we found, we'll get back what we lost, and then some.
[166:12.93]We'll live like kings.
[166:21.19]Oh, they got the crystal.
[166:21.83]Manga-esque.
[166:49.33]If they drop that into the ocean, is it gonna, like, electrocute Earth?
[166:58.86]Remember we talked about that?
[167:00.38]How I said, alright, if you, if there was, if you dropped, like, electrical wire, like, into the ocean, wouldn't it just, like, everywhere on Earth?
[167:09.30]Like, how?
[167:09.96]How does that make any sense?
[167:17.19]To be, it actually is a to be continued.
[167:23.42]Well, that was great.
[167:24.02]Mega Man Legends, that was a lot of fun.
[167:27.63]The camera sucks.
[167:29.05]The camera sucks.
[167:31.65]The game was really, really great.
[167:32.79]It took me 9 hours and 48 minutes of actual playing the video game and probably like 12 to 14.
[167:40.88]It was like stopping and going like, no, let me tell you something.
[167:44.56]You have to add that factor in.
[167:57.64]You watched one hour of that?
[167:59.76]Well, thanks for watching.
[168:01.58]Thanks for playing.
[168:10.31]But yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[168:11.85]In a world covered by endless water.
[168:17.47]That was part two.
[168:19.99]The first time ever.
[168:22.13]I turned the stream off earlier this afternoon and came back for a part two stream.
[168:25.93]I've never done that before.
[168:32.37]Maybe I have.
[168:33.83]But that's gonna be it.
[168:34.69]We'll continue reading the bits.
[168:35.63]I'll see you guys tomorrow at 2 p.m.
[168:36.81]Pacific for a more normal stream.
[168:41.05]Not broken up like this one was.
[168:43.67]See you tomorrow.
[168:47.57]I was here.
[168:54.66]Good night, those of you that are going to bed.
[168:56.80]And we'll see you tomorrow, those of you that are sticking around.
[168:58.42]And if there's bits to talk about, we'll go over them.
[169:11.79]Alright, so, we had, uh, that was Gnarly's bits.
[169:14.91]I forgot, I hosted the League of Legends channel for three days, accidentally.
[169:21.30]That was kind of a mess, but, uh, whatever, that's cool.
[169:26.53]But they also say, um, we're thrilled to invite you into the League Partner Program.
[169:30.07]As a partner, we will advertise your stream on the League of Legends client, and your germans will earn in-game rewards for watching your stream.
[169:38.30]Partners must stream League of Legends minimum 20 hours per week.
[169:41.44]We hope to see you on the Rift.
[169:45.04]That's just the, hey, I'm the guy from Mixer, but you replaced it with League of Legends.
[169:52.72]Hey, PeacefulHaley, thanks for the $2.50, Haley.
[169:56.53]And Haley says, Uh, hey Jerma, I actually just got back from the ER.
[170:00.20]I woke up this morning with severe side stomach pain, and it was like a 7 out of 10.
[170:04.70]And when I got to the hospital, the pain I was in, I was getting so pissy with the doctors in my family, and I'm like yelling to get rid of the pain.
[170:11.98]I did a casket, it turns out I have kidney stones in both kidneys.
[170:14.87]Holy shit.
[170:15.91]That's not good.
[170:17.61]I gotta pass them soon.
[170:20.45]I wish you luck.
[170:21.21]Holy shit, that sounds terrible.
[170:25.95]Also gonna stop drinking soda.
[170:29.34]That was my day.
[170:31.32]Yeah, cut back on soda.
[170:32.44]Soda... You don't want to be drinking soda.
[170:35.64]Sometimes it's good.
[170:36.88]I used to love it.
[170:38.25]I still do.
[170:40.53]Cut out half the sodas you drink a day with water, and maybe squeeze a little bit of lemon in there.
[170:44.85]You won't... If you need that sweetness, you need that sugar, you need that tang, squeeze a little bit of lemon, just a little bit, and it's in the water, and you trick your brain into thinking you're drinking a fucking fruity, yummy drink.
[171:02.87]Lime water, yes.
[171:05.89]If that's what you need to drink more water, that's what you need to do.
[171:10.54]Just a little squeeze of lime.
[171:11.56]That's it.
[171:14.31]No, not lemonade.
[171:15.13]Not lemonade.
[171:15.81]No.
[171:17.71]Squeeze of lime.
[171:19.57]Or you could just drink water.
[171:20.59]That's also true.
[171:21.21]But some people don't like to drink water.
[171:22.97]If you're one of those people, then... Gotta find ways to do it.
[171:35.51]What about sugar-free lemonade?
[171:37.39]No, because that has all kinds of other, like, chemical bullshit in it you don't want either.
[171:50.86]Sugar-free wa- sugar- sugar-free lemonade has, like, it has to- it's got, like, fucking xylitol in it, or, like, aspartame, and you just- just be natural, for God's sake.
[172:06.51]Well, he's a lemon.
[172:09.53]Xylophone.
[172:12.83]Your body doesn't filter the fake sugars very well.
[172:19.84]That's true.
[172:22.68]But I wish you a quick recovery.
[172:24.98]Hopefully you pass him.
[172:26.48]And it's not too painful, because that sucks.
[172:32.82]Thanks for the 250.
[172:33.68]We wish you a swift recovery, Hayley.
[172:37.09]Uh, Labster, thanks for five community subs.
[172:39.07]Juno Upsetto, thanks for 250.
[172:40.73]They say pog champion.
[172:43.03]Thanks for the pog champion.
[172:48.95]Jerma is endorsing natural remedies.
[172:53.21]Get the fuck out of here with that.
[172:54.45]I just said just drink.
[172:55.75]If you don't like water, you can squeeze some lime in it.
[172:58.21]Done.
[172:58.87]That's it.
[172:59.25]That's all I said.
[173:00.47]Twisted.
[173:00.87]You're twisting me.
[173:03.28]Reaper, thanks for the five dollars.
[173:05.08]Hey, Gemma, you're back from the doctors.
[173:06.30]Hope you're alright.
[173:07.58]Anyway, how did you get it?
[173:09.34]It wasn't from falling from your chair during the stream awards, was it?
[173:12.02]That would be really embarrassing.
[173:13.84]Now, I've had this for like two and a half years.
[173:15.68]Just, yeah, I've had it since... It was before Vegas.
[173:21.12]It's been a nagging problem for at least somewhere about maybe 18 to 20 months.
[173:28.44]Something like that.
[173:29.84]Just under two years.
[173:33.33]We're still trying to get it situated.
[173:37.84]What does he have?
[173:39.70]The current diagnosis is costochondritis.
[173:43.24]Inflammation in my rib cage.
[173:44.30]I'm doing physical therapy for it.
[173:46.68]And if that doesn't work, and if that is what it actually is, and it's determined that's the only thing I can do, then I have to get an intercostal nerve block.
[173:56.53]It's an injection into one of my nerves.
[173:59.55]Kind of sucks, but, you know, we do what we have to do.
[174:12.51]It's not... I'm fine.
[174:14.59]Don't worry.
[174:16.28]It's just an annoying issue.
[174:19.46]But we'll see if PT does it.
[174:25.60]Are you paying $2,000 for 15-minute visits?
[174:28.45]No, no.
[174:31.77]No.
[174:34.13]I need to get an exoskeleton.
[174:35.53]That'd be pretty great.
[174:38.57]William and SuperBruce both gave five subs.
[174:40.43]Want to touch upon them?
[174:41.17]We did already, but thanks, guys.
[174:43.03]Thanks for the five subs.
[174:49.17]Look at me.
[174:49.75]I have Costco Hosil.
[174:55.41]I probably should just make, like, an exclamation point.
[174:58.42]Costa Contritis.
[175:00.04]So that they could just be like... People do ask about it a lot, and I just don't want to ignore them.
[175:09.40]Uh, Bulbaswag, thanks for the 500 bits.
[175:11.04]Hey gamer, do you think it's more economically sound to save my channel points for the next big wink channel points thing, or use my points now?
[175:21.18]Also, I had a theory that you only introduce winks so you'd have to wear clothes.
[175:26.19]Well, I mean, I didn't mean to do that.
[175:32.27]That's... That's sort of an issue.
[175:38.70]is me needing to wear clothes and have to turn the facecam on every stream.
[175:41.34]I mean, that's the big problem.
[175:43.23]Ooh, is that Otto?
[175:46.51]Wait, you wanna get out of here?
[175:48.17]You wanna get out?
[175:51.17]He wants to get out.
[175:51.77]Hold on, give me one sec.
[175:53.15]Wanna go to the side?
[175:54.79]Wanna go?
[175:55.07]Alright, let's go.
[176:29.85]What was it?
[176:31.49]Is it more economically sound?
[176:33.27]Hey, you do whatever you want to do with your channel points.
[176:36.99]The new thing that replaces Wink is, I guarantee, is not going to be substantially more interesting than the Wink.
[176:44.49]It's probably going to be like Rita Popsicle joke, like people have suggested.
[176:56.88]But, thank you.
[176:59.76]You're gonna need hundreds of jokes.
[177:01.26]No!
[177:03.52]No, I don't think so.
[177:04.24]The winks only happen five to ten times a stream anyways.
[177:07.56]Hey, Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[177:14.17]Also found out I have a hiatal hernia as well.
[177:16.23]That explains my other stomach pains.
[177:18.61]I'm glad I finally have my questions answered.
[177:20.25]Hope you don't go through even more pain.
[177:21.87]Have a good night.
[177:24.27]You got the double diagnosis today.
[177:27.41]Sorry to hear that.
[177:29.39]Yeah, I have- I have a hiatal hernia, but it's... I've been told it's not big enough to be that much of a concern.
[177:37.43]And... It's not what's causing my problems.
[177:42.10]That's what the doctor said.
[177:43.06]He's like, that's not what you're- why you're feeling like shit.
[177:46.78]And I'm like, really?
[177:49.62]He's like, yeah, you have one, but it's not big enough to really truly be causing the pain.
[177:53.71]And you're like, you're back in ribs.
[177:55.77]I'm like, oh, okay.
[178:00.85]There was a wink?
[178:01.55]Oh, well, fucking hold on.
[178:02.88]Shit, I didn't even know.
[178:05.80]On the small patches of land that remain above the sea, the people of this world rely on ancient technology.
[178:13.28]It's hard to just wink.
[178:14.18]It is.
[178:14.58]Driven by quantum refractors, a powerful energy... It's hard to do it in a world.
[178:20.46]...by ancient ruins underground.
[178:23.24]Look at me.
[178:23.54]Thank you so much for being you, Jerma.
[178:24.60]Thank you.
[178:25.26]Appreciate the five dollars.
[178:40.67]Thank you.
[178:43.31]I'm a pain thanks to the five community subs.
[178:47.01]Jerma sucks thanks to the five community subs.
[178:48.89]Both of you.
[178:51.77]Hail to the chief thanks for the 300 bits.
[178:54.39]Wasn't expecting a BF Bugleberry cameo this stream, but I'm pretty sure that chat loved it.
[178:59.66]They have a well-connected relationship with Fugleberry, I think.
[179:02.86]Thank you, Flugboy, for the five dollars.
[179:04.66]Seeking the mother load.
[179:05.54]The diggers travel from one... What's his message?
[179:07.76]A weird message.
[179:08.44]Hold on.
[179:08.74]What are you saying?
[179:09.20]Hope.
[179:09.46]Despair.
[179:10.64]Charity.
[179:29.12]Wait!
[179:29.68]Oh, you missed it.
[179:30.28]Oh well.
[179:30.64]Yeah, I'll never play Tarkov.
[179:35.86]I won't even install that game.
[179:36.68]Ever.
[180:01.69]I couldn't do it.
[180:06.11]I'm a coward.
[180:06.59]That's fine.
[180:07.39]I will be a coward.
[180:14.11]I... I... Alright.
[180:16.09]I don't do well in those games.
[180:17.33]I don't like it.
[180:21.42]Not my thing.
[180:27.22]I do well in games where I can, like,
[180:30.44]Oh, the enemy is swinging at me.
[180:33.04]I-frame dodge, I-frame dodge, I-frame dodge, I-frame dodge, I-frame dodge, I-frame dodge, I-frame dodge, swing, swing, swing, I-frame dodge, I-frame dodge, I-frame dodge, I-frame dodge.
[180:40.55]Like, I do okay doing those.
[180:51.81]Monster Hunter?
[180:52.56]No.
[180:55.90]Hey DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.
[180:57.66]I forgot to make this donation during the first Mega Man Legends stream, but the fact that your point of reference for his son Drears with Tron is Angelica from Rugrats is the most fucking cursed shit I've ever heard.
[181:15.17]What are you talking about?
[181:17.25]She just acted like Angelica.
[181:19.81]That was my point of reference.
[181:21.37]That's my information I have.
[181:31.85]Play some Fortnite and take L. Captivate.
[181:40.25]Thanks for the 300 bits and 500 bits.
[181:42.54]$8 here.
[181:43.06]No message.
[181:43.56]Just $8 in bits.
[181:44.68]Thank you.
[181:47.46]Oh, you actually did say something.
[181:50.08]You gave $10 in bits total.
[181:52.34]Yo, Jerma.
[181:53.02]Big ups on the streams.
[181:54.64]Been watching it for over a year.
[181:58.46]Appreciate you.
[181:59.00]Thank you.
[182:03.49]Thank you, Captivate.
[182:04.23]Appreciate it.
[182:05.19]Thanks for sticking around.
[182:06.23]JermaSucks gave 10 more community subs.
[182:13.08]Thank you, JermaSucks.
[182:14.38]JermaSucks is one of the big community sub contributors to this stream.
[182:21.32]Let's get him on the screen.
[182:25.72]Pumped you.
[182:27.14]Sorry, I did the wrong noise.
[182:28.25]It was supposed to be...
[182:35.29]Whoops.
[182:36.83]Here they come.
[182:42.23]Why are they?
[182:46.45]My computer has been a piece of shit lately.
[182:48.82]I haven't really talked about that, have I?
[182:51.24]Happy time for an upgrade.
[182:52.24]What do I have?
[182:52.80]I have a 1080.
[182:54.52]Is a 1080 still good?
[183:00.24]I have a regular, just a regular 1080.
[183:02.24]It's still good, right?
[183:03.41]I don't need to upgrade?
[183:04.15]What the fuck?
[183:04.55]Who cares?
[183:08.30]Here come the credits.
[183:09.46]Thanks, everybody, for subbing.
[183:13.49]That's my CPU.
[183:14.75]Uh, it's an i7-68?
[183:16.07]I have it.
[183:17.23]It's listed here, right?
[183:18.59]It's like a 6-core i7, isn't it?
[183:20.23]i7-6850.
[183:20.31]GTX 1080 Hybrid.
[183:20.59]What does that mean?
[183:36.53]No, I don't need to upgrade.
[183:37.81]I'm fine.
[183:43.22]Get a Threadripper.
[183:45.94]Yeah, the plan eventually is to get a monster CPU so I can do a higher quality.
[183:56.14]Instead of streaming, because I stream at 720p 60.
[183:58.76]I'd like to go to like 960, 900p.
[184:04.61]1080, I still don't like the idea of doing 1080.
[184:06.69]I don't think it looks good at the bitrate that Twitch allows you to use.
[184:12.92]And with a Threadripper or something, I could probably drop my preset to make it look really good and make it at somewhere around 900p.
[184:26.74]with 1080 Twitch only allows 6 000 up to if you go more than that they actually don't like it at all so anything more than 6 000 up if you have if you have a 1080p stream and you're not at somewhere or at like eight to ten thousand up for a bit rate it's just I it's not I don't think it's worth doing
[184:57.88]So I would be somewhere probably around 900.
[185:04.89]I don't know this computer talk.
[185:06.07]What's happening?
[185:06.55]We're just talking about computers and how fast they are.
[185:11.89]You get a lot of encoding crossed on action games.
[185:14.05]Yeah, you could do like 1080 and 30, but I don't want to do 1080 and 30.
[185:22.44]I'd rather stay at 60.
[185:26.14]But, um, thank you everybody for subbing.
[185:29.76]Appreciate it.
[185:32.16]I think we're so far beyond 30 FPS at this point, as the internet grows and progresses here, and we consume all this media.
[185:40.67]30 FPS, I don't think is... It's like, whoa, you're at 30 FPS.
[185:47.80]I think most people, almost everybody streams at 60 nowadays.
[185:54.05]And this stream has been streaming 60 FPS for three, four plus years.
[186:00.11]So it'd be really weird to be like, oh, by the way, I'm at 1080, but I'm at 30 FPS now.
[186:08.82]But anyways, let's move this and go to the end.
[186:14.28]So we're at the end.
[186:19.91]I will see you all tomorrow, 2 p.m.,
[186:23.99]But we have 250 from C4G.
[186:25.65]I hit Legend and Hearthstone for the first time yesterday and I'm dedicating this victory to you, the Chicken League Champion.
[186:30.66]I will never stream Hearthstone again.
[186:34.08]It was fun while it lasted, though.
[186:39.12]Erdemius, thanks for the 250.
[186:40.57]Hey, I don't care what chat says.
[186:41.89]Bugleberry's the greatest character to ever grace the stream.
[186:44.79]I love all of his appearances on the stream.
[186:46.27]Do you have any pointers on where I could find a mask that looks like him?
[186:49.83]I really want to cosplay him.
[186:52.73]I actually don't.
[186:54.03]I don't.
[186:56.25]That mask is not readily available.
[187:01.40]Because you're talking about somebody's face.
[187:05.30]There's not a mask of Bugleberry's face?
[187:09.63]Why would there be a mask of that?
[187:12.59]It's not like a president or something.
[187:23.59]What are you monkaS-ing?
[187:27.87]He's a pop culture icon.
[187:29.29]No, he's not.
[187:30.37]Is he?
[187:34.60]This fucking guy laughing my ass off.
[187:38.20]Hey, Digitron Surfers, thanks for 1,000 bits.
[187:41.22]10 bucks.
[187:42.97]Thank you.
[187:51.18]You don't have to read this out loud.
[187:52.62]Okay, hold on.
[187:59.71]I see what you're saying here.
[188:00.97]Okay, alright.
[188:04.87]I'm going to tell you.
[188:05.43]I'm kind of out of that game at this point.
[188:09.30]I'm out of that game.
[188:10.14]I'm out of that game at this point.
[188:15.04]It's not the codes anymore.
[188:17.72]It's a voice work thing.
[188:21.10]I don't really do it anymore.
[188:24.12]And I don't... It's not something that I really do.
[188:30.99]No more voice acting.
[188:32.59]He hates it.
[188:35.03]It's just something I... I would love to put time into it, but I'd rather put time into this, but... No, not voicing Sonic.
[188:46.10]He's retired.
[188:49.32]He's retired.
[188:54.11]He does voice acting in every game without real voice acting, yeah.
[188:58.67]Are you available?
[188:59.51]Hey!
[189:00.31]I'm not available!
[189:03.23]At all!
[189:03.63]You can only do four voices anyway.
[189:13.58]I appreciate the offer, I just, I don't really, I don't really do it.
[189:19.34]Not anymore.
[189:20.33]But Otto's yelling at me.
[189:21.45]Can you hear Otto fucking yelling at me?
[189:23.33]He's like, hey!
[189:25.05]What does he want from me?
[189:25.77]Can you hear him?
[189:28.05]He just went, hey!
[189:30.81]Hey!
[189:31.31]Maybe he's hungry.
[189:35.82]No, he's probably hungry.
[189:36.46]Alright, I will see you guys tomorrow.
[189:42.78]Thank you for watching this weird double feature here.
[189:47.36]Mega Man Legends was awesome.
[189:48.86]Got frustrated at one or two parts, but it's a 20-year-old game, so how's that not going to happen?
[189:53.97]I think it holds up pretty well.
[189:55.03]I loved it.
[189:55.99]Play the second one soon.
[189:59.47]Talk to you guys tomorrow.
[190:00.62]Black and white, too.
[190:02.70]Have a nice night.
[190:21.98]Thank you.
