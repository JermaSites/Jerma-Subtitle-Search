[00:00.81]Ah, yes.
[00:01.93]The return of the dentist.
[00:06.21]I almost just said Happy Halloween.
[00:09.73]Hey, Happy Halloween, everybody.
[00:12.97]That whole month has just been deleted in my brain.
[00:18.62]Quick, slime them.
[00:24.34]See, what you guys don't know is I have all those actions still.
[00:30.16]I might just turn a stream on one day, and if I do those, something happens.
[00:34.57]I have those forever.
[00:36.21]I get to keep those.
[00:40.37]But, yeah, we're starting a little bit early, too.
[00:44.51]First, happy Halloween, and then, hey, we're starting early.
[00:47.11]No, we're starting late because it's Thanksgiving.
[00:50.38]And I wanted to give some time to not just start streaming at 1, 2 o'clock Pacific.
[00:57.60]I figured it's probably better this way.
[01:01.32]So, we're going to continue the Outer Worlds.
[01:05.77]This is going to be the last stream you see from me for a little bit.
[01:10.04]I'll be gone for about three or four days.
[01:12.89]Because I have a procedure I have to do.
[01:15.95]And it requires... Some annoying fasting as of tomorrow.
[01:22.56]And then I have to do it.
[01:24.24]And then I have to... Be on drugs.
[01:27.88]So... You won't see me for... Maybe three or four days?
[01:33.14]So after today, this is just gonna be... We're gonna end The Outer Worlds tonight.
[01:37.60]Even if I don't get to the end...
[01:40.44]probably just finish it off stream it depends on how close we get because I really don't know if this stream is going to be more than five or six hours I don't know they might be five it might be four it might be six this might be eight I don't know but happy Thanksgiving if you're celebrating it or if you've not celebrated it yet if you just got this notification and you're at the dinner table
[02:09.98]Then put me on as loud as it goes, put me on speaker, and sit me on the table.
[02:19.96]Yeah, can I get the, um... Can I get the peas?
[02:23.01]Thank you.
[02:29.58]The turkey is absolutely delicious, by the way.
[02:32.64]It's one of the best turkeys I've ever had.
[02:34.24]And I really am not... I know I say that every single year.
[02:37.44]I know I say that... Listen, mom.
[02:40.28]I know I say that every year.
[02:41.58]Every time you've ever made a turkey, I say it's the best turkey I've ever had.
[02:45.18]But this one is for real.
[02:49.00]Damn, that's good.
[02:50.14]Oh, sorry.
[02:50.50]I mean, darn.
[02:51.25]Sorry about that.
[02:56.59]Alright, now turn me off, because I'm going to start swearing, and I know, like, your grandfather's not going to like it.
[03:01.39]Am I off?
[03:02.27]Alright, good.
[03:05.77]Anyways, let's play the Outer Worlds.
[03:11.12]All of a sudden, Grandpa's like, Outer Worlds?
[03:13.56]Ooh!
[03:14.56]No, no, keep that on, keep that on.
[03:18.00]Hey, anything to take me away from your family, like, arguing about politics?
[03:24.59]We can argue about like the fake politics that are in the outer world.
[03:29.42]Right?
[03:33.90]You don't need, you don't need, listen, grandpa, everybody, you don't need to argue anymore.
[03:37.54]Just listen to me.
[03:38.17]Alright, let's get going.
[03:51.75]I like this song.
[03:52.64]I wish it was not just a level up screen.
[03:58.16]What about those emails?
[04:00.85]Well, I've read tons of emails on computers already.
[04:04.57]I've read a lot of emails.
[04:09.29]Yeah, we'll see how this goes.
[04:11.09]Just gonna keep playing it.
[04:11.83]If you don't know, you probably, if this is the first stream you've been to and you're like, why is it, what does this have to do with dentists?
[04:18.73]Ah, that is a 15 plus hour long build up for the joke.
[04:24.09]And there's not much I could say.
[04:26.37]It would take me 15 hours to explain it to you.
[04:29.79]So yeah, let's go.
[04:36.43]I just love dental health, yeah.
[04:41.84]Alright, let the game load.
[04:42.74]Hold on.
[04:45.72]Alright.
[04:47.04]So, the last thing we did was... I remember I was, like, really tired last night.
[04:49.84]I didn't listen to a single thing this person said.
[04:53.61]I think I specifically said, this guy's boring the fuck out of me.
[04:56.09]And then, like, I turned off the stream.
[04:57.97]So, I don't remember what this was.
[05:05.67]Then I killed him.
[05:06.44]No, he's still alive.
[05:07.42]Alright, here we go.
[05:09.68]We have to go back to...
[05:11.96]The information broker promised to find the location of the chemicals needed.
[05:15.96]By Phineas.
[05:17.18]Problem is, he hasn't delivered the intel on time and hasn't provided an explanation.
[05:21.28]Travel to Monarch, find him and obtain the data.
[05:24.28]Okay, this is where I am now.
[05:27.60]The broker can't deliver the location of the chemicals until you stop the Iconoclasts and MSI transmissions that are interfering with the tower.
[05:34.79]Okay.
[05:36.76]So, Sanjar leads MSI out of Stellar Bay, and Graham Bryant leads the Iconoclasts out of Amber Heights.
[05:45.39]Earning their favor might convince them to stop transmitting.
[05:48.97]Complete the quest Bolt with his name for Sanjar to start earning MSI's trust.
[05:56.35]Alright, so what do I want to do here?
[05:59.57]Should I just go take a chainsaw and cut the tower down?
[06:08.83]Well, let's... Let's go to, uh... Sanjar needs a bolt 52 cartridge.
[06:15.07]I remember this part.
[06:17.39]Alright.
[06:18.23]Let's get into... Let's get into the good graces of Sanjar.
[06:23.67]So we need to get into the arms building.
[06:25.87]Now, where the hell is that?
[06:29.29]Oh, fuck.
[06:29.95]Sorry, I forgot.
[06:31.30]Yeah, I forgot.
[06:31.82]I forgot I was gonna shoot that guy in the head right when the stream started.
[06:34.34]Oops.
[06:38.21]I forgot.
[06:38.91]Yeah, I was like actually planning on doing that too.
[06:41.11]It's alright.
[06:41.65]Whatever.
[06:44.13]Fuck.
[06:45.17]Damn it.
[06:46.47]Oh, I was too busy like thinking about Thanksgiving.
[06:51.92]Oh, that was gonna be fun too.
[06:55.58]Damn it.
[06:56.16]I really like was gonna do that.
[06:57.46]I was gonna actually do that.
[06:59.46]Begin brought.
[07:00.00]Wait, I can just start.
[07:01.22]I can turn the stream button on?

[07:55.13]Alright, now where is this thing?
[07:58.53]That's very far away.
[08:03.38]But it's not far away from

[10:00.66]God damn it.
[10:02.84]Alright, user special.
[10:03.62]Don't call them stupid.
[10:08.27]Well, they are stupid.
[10:09.13]I mean, their intelligence level is not very high.
[10:17.03]That doesn't mean I don't... Neither is my character.
[10:20.89]Yeah.
[10:21.57]That's okay.
[10:23.01]You call me stupid.
[10:24.17]I am... Like, this character is stupid.
[10:26.31]But so is that animal that's right there.
[10:28.77]This animal is also stupid.
[10:34.13]Why did I shoot the Colossus?
[10:40.74]I probably should not have shot the Colossus.
[10:42.58]That's called... That was stupid.
[10:44.73]You are absolutely inclined to call me fucking stupid for that.
[10:49.90]Gotta run.
[10:52.26]Wait, it's in here.
[10:56.54]Holy shit, he just almost insta-killed me.

[11:12.35]I don't have any heals left.
[11:13.73]Oh, this is... Okay, well, that's a disaster.
[11:17.65]How do I not have any heals left?
[11:27.47]Oh, goddammit.
[11:30.16]I'm just gonna go the other way.
[11:34.58]How do I... I only have one heal?
[11:36.54]Who took him?
[11:40.97]Wait, hold on a minute.
[11:41.73]I gotta go to Stella Bay.
[11:43.71]I gotta buy some heals.
[11:53.89]What happened to Sam and Max?
[11:55.50]They're still on the ship.
[11:56.68]I was just trying two other dentists.
[11:58.42]Oh, yeah.
[12:01.46]Everything's back to the way it should be.
[12:07.00]Thank you for bringing my...
[12:09.81]Okay, well that's still there.
[12:11.13]You guys, that's true.
[12:12.33]Alright.
[12:15.48]Uh, I need to, just, a vending machine or something.
[12:21.36]Alright, do you sell stuff?
[12:22.96]Not the stuff I want.
[12:25.02]There we go.
[12:27.28]Buy them.
[12:30.76]Okay, what is this?
[12:32.98]Baked beans?
[12:33.84]No.
[12:40.39]Oh, fuck me.
[12:41.35]Really?
[12:41.63]That's the same goddamn syringe.
[12:45.15]I bought the wrong thing.
[12:45.99]Alright, where's the medic?
[12:53.49]Where's the person that sells medicine?
[12:55.02]There you are.
[13:04.02]Come to share a secret with Auntie Abigail?
[13:06.77]I would like to buy something.
[13:08.57]Oh, god damn it.
[13:09.39]Why can I not buy anything from you?
[13:12.36]Aren't you the town medic?
[13:16.08]What?
[13:21.60]Steal?
[13:22.04]I can't even steal.
[13:22.70]I already took everything from her house.
[13:26.88]Is there a vending machine in there?
[13:28.00]Or do I have to go find the vending machine?
[13:34.01]You don't sell, do you?
[13:35.41]Nothing.
[13:35.69]Vending machine.
[13:36.07]Vendor.
[13:36.29]Okay.
[13:36.39]Uh... The Yacht Club vendor?
[13:37.45]Can I not see what these are?
[14:01.62]Vending machine.
[14:02.14]Like, I can't... It's just there?
[14:03.71]Alright, well, it's just there, apparently.
[14:08.51]Go buy a yacht.
[14:09.45]Wasn't this the one I was just using?
[14:15.97]Maybe not.
[14:16.87]Okay, what's in here?
[14:21.06]Uh, there's no heals here.
[14:24.06]Don't tell me I have to travel to, like, another galaxy to buy heals.
[14:27.48]That's not gonna happen, right?
[14:35.69]Where's this other one?
[14:36.39]In here?
[14:41.76]Wasn't I just... Okay, so it's... Where's this one?
[14:47.92]Alright, time to get in a spaceship and travel across the galaxy to buy Stimpaks.
[14:53.59]What?
[14:53.89]What?
[15:00.34]Uh, sure, I'll take a drink.
[15:01.30]Enjoy.
[15:03.62]If you're keeping Nyoka company, you'll need a few to keep up with her.
[15:06.84]Sure.
[15:07.06]Do you have any heels?
[15:07.60]You need a person on this planet who can keep up with me.
[15:11.38]Wait, we are talking about a drinking contest, right?
[15:15.13]Now what can I do for you?
[15:19.23]No, you just have booze.
[15:19.87]Alright, well, where's my actual ship?
[15:32.56]This is a heal, right?
[15:33.86]Injectable healing enhancer.
[15:36.26]Heals 20.
[15:36.82]Okay.
[15:37.42]My goodness.
[15:37.90]There we go.
[15:43.79]Good.
[15:43.89]Alright, I got enough.
[15:52.01]Uh, where is it?
[15:56.92]There it is.
[15:58.78]Alright, I got 39.
[15:59.48]And I got this, uh... What do I want to use?
[16:04.28]Critical damage plus 15%.
[16:05.50]Yeah.
[16:06.56]Let's, like, use this shit.
[16:09.08]I bought the wrong thing.
[16:10.04]No, it's not.
[16:11.95]Heals 25% health over 2 seconds.
[16:15.37]Isn't that just, like, a quick heal?
[16:21.61]You're gonna get addicted to drugs.
[16:24.43]That's alright.
[16:32.46]He's already addicted.
[16:34.61]No, I've been breathing in all kinds of gases.
[16:39.23]And my character's fine.
[16:40.35]No, the only thing that's happened to me this whole game is I'm afraid of monsters.
[16:48.65]That's it.
[16:55.27]It's giving me a choice.
[16:56.25]It gives you a choice if you want to be afraid of monsters or not.
[17:00.65]Okay, let's go.
[17:06.04]It's like, you know, you've seen quite a few monsters.
[17:08.80]Are you scared of them?
[17:10.12]Yes!
[17:11.56]No.
[17:12.18]Okay.
[17:12.72]But if you were scared of them, we would give you a point to put in.
[17:16.58]Ooh, I'm scared of monsters.
[17:19.29]They terrify me.
[17:20.15]I'm just like lying on a fucking job interview.
[17:25.67]Alright, let's just move.
[17:30.91]Don't attack the Colossus.
[17:40.66]Dead?
[17:43.44]Oh, for the love of God, I'm just running.
[17:45.38]I don't even have it selected.
[17:48.44]Yes, I do.
[17:50.49]Get into the arms building.
[17:58.77]I can't even.
[17:59.45]I have to, like, find a keycard or something.
[18:02.95]I can't even lockpick this fucking door.
[18:11.27]It's so dead.
[18:12.31]There's a whole entire town of monsters chasing at us.
[18:20.86]Why are you using that?
[18:25.10]Good.
[18:25.28]The big one can't even get in.
[18:26.16]Just feed him in here.
[18:34.99]Okay.
[18:36.71]How am I supposed to get in that building?
[18:44.32]The Bolt 52 is an abandoned building north of Stellar Bay, so I need a key card to get into there, but I don't have one.
[18:49.96]I have to get a... I need one of those lockpickers.
[18:53.38]You guys just... You're doing fine out there.
[18:54.96]Oh my god.
[19:22.60]I need one mag lock.
[19:25.48]Is that seriously the only way I can get in this building?
[19:28.46]I almost just shot you.
[19:30.50]Well, there has to be another way.
[19:35.77]Where's the big guy?
[19:38.83]Alright, all the way down there.
[19:39.79]Good.
[19:43.85]Alright, so... Front door, I need one of those lockpick things.
[19:50.50]This doesn't work, or a keycard, but where the hell would the keycard be?
[20:00.32]I can't jump up or anything?
[20:01.40]No, I have to go in the door.
[20:11.45]There's no way for me to climb, right?
[20:15.93]Alright, well, let's try to find one of those door openers.
[20:30.17]That can't seriously be the only way you can get in that building.
[20:35.05]Let's try to find one.
[20:36.51]Think they left anything good behind?
[20:38.55]That's a good question.
[20:39.29]If anyone's inside, they're liable to respond with gunfire.
[20:45.64]What about here?
[20:46.46]Can I open up a panel in the back?
[20:56.69]Let's find a door opener.
[20:57.89]I just need to find one of those... Not the stunts.
[21:00.45]The magpix.
[21:09.80]Evicted.
[21:10.38]Can't go in.
[21:13.38]Nothing was in here.
[21:14.58]What about over here?
[21:21.62]Oh, alright.
[21:24.02]We're gonna keep looking.
[21:24.91]Okay.
[21:41.59]Blue bodies?
[21:43.23]Monsters will have a door open to pick on them?
[21:47.64]I don't think so.
[21:53.56]Only monsters live in this whole galaxy here.
[21:56.10]This whole planet is just these aliens.
[21:59.01]I don't think they're picking locks.
[22:01.27]I think they're eating people and knocking doors down with their tails.
[22:21.77]Give me it here.
[22:23.91]Come on.
[22:26.29]No, shit.
[22:29.79]I think I've seen more weapon mods than I have magpix.
[22:46.22]Just me.
[22:53.54]Everybody's evicted.
[22:54.36]I'm just, like, going back to the town now.
[23:03.85]What did I do for Thanksgiving?
[23:05.67]I did not do very much.
[23:07.59]Because... At this household, we did Thanksgiving a little early.
[23:13.45]Because I, as of yesterday... Could not eat a lot of the stuff that is served at Thanksgiving.
[23:23.35]So, no peas, no corn, no nuts, no... So I was kind of like, let's just do it early.
[23:38.64]So we did it a little early.
[23:44.30]Okay.
[23:45.34]Am I about to literally just bust a door down with my fucking face?
[23:53.99]How do I get up there?
[23:54.79]There's a ladder there, but can I jump from here?
[23:59.65]I can't jump from here to there.
[24:07.85]You can.
[24:08.31]I mean, maybe I can.
[24:20.29]Oh my god, damn it.
[24:25.95]I wonder can I get off of this planet.
[24:27.81]This planet sucks.
[24:42.94]I have to like de-aggro the gigantic guy.
[24:53.94]What's the aggro range?
[24:54.76]Alright, well I de-aggroed him, but I have to cross the fucking moat again!
[24:59.04]I can't kill him.
[25:17.03]Don't turn around, don't turn around, don't turn around, don't turn around, don't turn around.
[25:20.73]Don't turn around.
[25:22.59]Good.
[25:23.25]Keep eating- keep eating Ellie.
[25:31.26]Alright.
[25:34.80]Now turn around.
[25:41.36]He's gonna see me.
[25:44.83]Maybe not.
[25:47.55]Okay.
[25:51.35]So can I jump from here to there to there?
[25:54.09]I like how he's saying that there's a ladder.
[25:58.09]I don't know what you're talking about.
[26:00.43]I see that one.
[26:02.59]But not over here.
[26:03.51]Come on.
[26:08.60]There's a ladder on the other building?
[26:14.56]If I have to kill one more of these Warcraft monsters, I swear to God.
[26:27.02]I'm talking about like go up here and then cross from the top.
[26:29.50]Okay, I see what you mean.
[26:31.42]It's a ladder in another game.
[26:32.85]I didn't realize this was here.
[27:01.78]Alright, I made it.
[27:15.11]Let me in, child!
[27:16.79]Let me in!
[27:21.26]Uh, sorry.
[27:22.02]Couldn't help it.
[27:22.70]Who's there?
[27:25.52]Why not keep that going?
[27:26.80]That would be hilarious.
[27:35.69]This person would think that you were a conscious, thought-thinking raptodon.
[27:42.61]I ran it here, and now the door's locked.
[27:44.09]Help.
[27:44.33]You got locked in?
[27:45.23]Well, I need to get in that room.
[27:47.56]I need to get in there.
[27:48.90]But maybe I'll let you starve first.
[27:51.38]That's terrible.
[27:54.40]I'll be here if you change your mind.
[28:00.27]On account of I can't do anything else.
[28:06.08]Open the door.
[28:06.56]I'll just go in.
[28:08.86]Don't worry.
[28:16.76]I'll get in there.
[28:17.30]50, 40, that's a lot.
[28:24.93]Alright, can I go up?
[28:31.63]Do I go up and around?
[28:34.33]Ooh, there's the mag pack.
[28:35.67]That's what I was looking for.
[28:46.41]View executive reviews.
[28:49.04]Loading last access document.
[28:53.26]Sandra has a bad habit of padding his reports with numbers and statistics.
[28:56.76]Not very good with slogans, jingles, and or taglines.
[29:00.88]Presentations tend to be dry and lacking in emotional appeal and funny references.
[29:06.71]Like the first 20 minutes of this stream.
[29:09.03]And it's really pissing people off.
[29:12.39]Sandjar also displays a noted tendency to complete work rather than delegating at a trend unbecoming in upper management.
[29:21.07]All in all, Sandra's work habits suggest a preoccupation with details and a startling lack of vision.
[29:25.25]Needs improvement.
[29:27.50]Okay.
[29:29.04]Screenshot it.
[29:30.14]Screenshot it.
[29:31.22]Hack, wait, what?
[29:32.62]Accessing restricted file.
[29:36.25]Spoof login credentials.
[29:38.79]Ooh.
[29:40.68]Graham's understanding of product messaging and branding is impressive, especially for a relatively low-level editor.
[29:46.54]He has a knack for memorable slogans and taglines.
[29:50.19]However, Graham has issues with brevity and shows consistent disregard for prescribed fonts and formats.
[29:56.15]Some of his work has been flagged for subversive under... What do I care?
[30:02.45]Just delete all their emails.
[30:03.53]Fuck it, I don't care.
[30:08.49]Oh, wait, that was, uh, I was... I was supposed to... I was supposed to do that.
[30:14.51]Force is... Well, looks like we're going the, uh, black hat route, because I, uh... I just did the thing that the bad guy just wanted me to do.
[30:31.48]Because I was too annoyed to go through the email, so I just deleted them.
[30:40.60]Alright, well, let's keep going.
[30:44.86]I'm getting in that room.
[30:47.96]I know you can hear me talking right now.
[30:50.00]I'm coming in that room!
[30:52.62]I'll be there real soon!
[30:53.78]75!
[30:53.80]Fuck.
[31:00.12]Fine.
[31:14.75]Mhm.
[31:22.44]I gotta go find the rat that ate him.
[31:29.28]Seeing as you're trapped, you might as well answer me a few things.
[31:33.10]Alright, we don't- fuck it, let's go get it.
[31:35.62]Uh, arms key.
[31:36.60]Mhm.
[31:39.69]Right.
[31:40.71]It's in the Colossus's stomach.
[31:44.83]Well, we're safe up here.
[31:49.48]That was so easy.
[31:50.44]How did I not be able... Why did I say I couldn't do that?
[31:54.78]That was simple.
[31:55.50]That was the easiest fucking enemy in the whole game.
[31:58.32]Why did I think that that was scary?
[32:01.70]I was actually scared of the monster, and it's built into my character's DNA.
[32:09.76]I could have just got that, like, 15 minutes ago.
[32:21.83]God damn it.
[32:22.97]I was... Come on in.
[32:30.53]Hi.
[32:35.68]Thank you so much.
[32:37.06]It was getting all stuffy in there, and I was getting a mite lightheaded, and I think maybe I was gonna die.
[32:42.27]Now I'm out here, and I'm headed back to Amber Heights.
[32:46.45]Still landing yourself in trouble, eh, Hux?
[32:49.89]Oh, hi, Nyoka.
[32:51.61]Um, you mind giving me an escort back home?
[32:54.28]I'm... Oh, you're traveling with someone.
[32:56.78]Never mind.
[33:01.58]Normally when you help someone, they give you something for the trouble.
[33:04.40]With the trouble you caused me, you're dying here.
[33:08.69]Normally when you help somebody, you get something.
[33:17.26]By being saved by me, you entered into a non-negotiable contract you now owe me.
[33:22.44]Give me something or I'm stuffing you back in here.
[33:29.20]Okay.
[33:29.70]Thank you.
[33:30.62]600 bits.
[33:32.18]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:38.67]Beat it.
[33:39.31]You sure you're okay?
[33:40.15]I don't care.
[33:42.23]Beat it.
[33:43.53]If Max were here, that would have ended a lot differently.
[34:07.24]I learned this in Britain!
[34:11.82]Max is- oh wait, can we do this?
[34:13.32]Let's do this together.
[34:13.98]You go over here and let's talk through the wall together.
[34:19.69]Whatever, thing sucks, let's go.
[34:21.81]Alright, did it!
[34:22.25]Alright, I have a criticism of the game.
[34:30.74]This whole game has... It's almost like I just got out of a pool.
[34:36.13]You know when you look at shit when you get out of a chlorine-filled pool?
[34:42.41]They have the chlorine pool filter on this whole game.
[34:47.47]I have too much stuff.
[34:53.51]Security blade?
[34:54.21]Get rid of it.
[34:56.35]Break it down.
[35:00.64]The scythe is cool.
[35:03.27]The Furman!
[35:03.89]What is that?
[35:04.35]I need to look at this stuff.
[35:18.71]What's this dude talking about?
[35:19.75]I'm talking about when you're in the pool for way too long.
[35:25.88]And you have a ton of wrinkly-ass skin.
[35:32.92]And when you, everything has like a haze that you can't get rid of for like 45 minutes.
[35:45.88]Have you guys never been in a pool?
[35:49.16]What?
[35:51.56]What?
[35:52.86]You guys don't know the pool eyes?
[35:55.94]No way, you guys have to know.
[35:59.20]You have to know this!
[36:00.68]I- I'm not gonna get- I'm not gonna get fuckin'... fibbed on here.
[36:04.81]Wait, I have options, let me see.
[36:08.77]Return the bolt to Sanjar.
[36:10.55]Uh, Sanjar leads the MSI, so I gotta complete the bolt quest and maybe he'll like me.
[36:17.36]What are you taunt- what?
[36:32.92]You know when things are so normal to you and you talk about how these normal ass things and a shitload of people tell you that that is not normal.
[36:44.47]If you go into a pool with chlorine in it and you like are going underwater and you're like opening your eyes underwater you get like haze around lights and
[36:59.04]What are you talking about?
[36:59.88]Don't do that?
[37:00.66]That's not... What?
[37:04.58]Why are you opening your eyes in a chlorine pool?
[37:06.50]No one opens their eyes in a chlorine pool.
[37:08.32]What are you talking about?
[37:11.86]Don't open your eyes... You guys didn't used to try to see really hard.
[37:17.94]You'd go underwater and you'd rip your eyes open and be like, look around and I want to be able to see underwater like Aquaman.
[37:23.85]You guys didn't do that?
[37:26.93]I know for a fact at least half of you did.
[37:34.40]You touch your eyes, you, like, eat... Please, don't even give me this, like... His chlorine's getting in his blood.
[37:41.94]You get out of the pool, and you, like, grab the sandwich, and you take a bite out of your ham and cheese sandwich next to the pool at the cooler with your mom.
[37:50.81]Well, you didn't wash your hands, did you?
[37:52.49]You've got chlorine in your mouth now.
[37:54.49]You're forever contaminated.
[37:59.29]Who eats with wet hands?
[38:00.61]I don't know!
[38:01.85]Ten-year-olds!
[38:04.64]You guys were ten once.
[38:06.62]Well, I see you had a sobering effect on our friend Nyoka.
[38:11.90]Sir, please stop.
[38:14.65]Forgive me, Celia.
[38:15.45]I couldn't help myself.
[38:17.97]Anyway, what can I do for you?
[38:21.93]Okay, hold on.
[38:22.33]This is important.
[38:23.03]Pay attention, everybody.
[38:27.09]Found your view on a terminal in the arms building.
[38:29.37]I need MSI to stop broadcasting your jamming devil's peak station.
[38:33.85]Found the cartridge and deleted that data for you.
[38:40.52]Look at this smug look.
[38:44.71]Hmm.
[38:51.76]I found that cartridge and accidentally deleted that data for you.
[38:55.62]Ooh.
[39:15.81]okay how exactly is data cartridge going to help you made it sound like you were sending me after a weapon I don't think this will fit in any of my guns see celia he gets it I told you he would so you did sir the world isn't changed with guns and speeches much as graham and his followers would like to think but rather with meticulous documentation chlorine
[39:43.09]Hey, by the way, all of you, all of you health nuts in the chat right now, when was the last time you drank water?
[39:52.83]You know what they put in the water, right?
[39:54.73]Chlorine.
[39:55.81]If you ever drink water out of the tap, you're drinking chlorine.
[40:01.05]Unless you got yourself a Berkey unit, then it clears it out.
[40:10.70]Use a filter.
[40:11.46]I do.
[40:11.96]I use a full Berkey water filtration system.
[40:18.86]Pool water and tap water are the same.
[40:33.36]uh you've ingested you've ingested chlorine in your life and and I you know you have and you're sitting there now going you you're doing the cartoon like Bugs Bunny you got your nails both your hands are up in your mouth and you're like ear of corn on your nails going wait a minute he's right
[41:00.84]Spare me the details of what comes next.
[41:02.52]Corporate espionage.
[41:04.82]How was that, Celia?
[41:06.02]Did I sell it?
[41:07.92]Your best delivery yet, sir.
[41:10.34]Do you filter your shower water?
[41:11.70]No, I don't shower.
[41:14.37]You guys shower in 2020.
[41:23.41]I just wait till it rains.
[41:25.39]And then I go out there with a bar of soap.
[41:27.55]That's a true natural way to bathe.
[41:34.29]That kind of spoils the effect if you have to ask.
[41:36.09]Promise me that once I've helped you with this, MSA will stop broadcasting.
[41:39.90]Yeah, you killed it.
[41:41.36]Going to the pool.
[41:43.66]With a bar of soap.
[41:52.81]Imagine if you were at like a community pool.
[41:55.65]And you're just sitting there with soap and you're all sudsed up.
[42:00.57]I'd be like, I'm out of here.
[42:01.73]I'm not going in this pool.
[42:06.31]What's the plan?
[42:07.21]I have reason to believe that one of the other corporations is operating on Monarch.
[42:12.13]Illegally and in secret.
[42:13.81]Uh-oh.
[42:14.43]Those bastards.
[42:16.36]Leave us to our perils, then come back just to reap what they can.
[42:20.36]If we can find proof, I can use that as leverage to encourage certain powers that be to accept our Bolt 52 and reinstate us on the board.
[42:31.56]Hmm.
[42:32.62]Now what does that mean for me?
[42:33.50]I remember me and Kim one time went to a community pool.
[42:45.13]And we walked in and nobody was in the pool.
[42:50.48]And we were like, what's going on here?
[42:51.58]Why is nobody in the pool?
[42:52.40]There was a bunch of people there.
[42:53.98]They're all sitting around the sides.
[42:56.30]And we're like, this is, alright, cool.
[42:57.86]We got like the, we can just go in.
[42:59.68]And Kim went to go in and she put, you know, she got maybe to her shins.
[43:05.27]And there was one of the lifeguards.
[43:08.37]Get out, out, out, out.
[43:10.41]Oh, what's going on?
[43:12.09]Oh, somebody threw up in the pool.
[43:14.88]So they have to shock it.
[43:16.54]It takes like an hour before anyone can go back in.
[43:20.40]And is it weird for me to say, not only do I not want to go in that pool, but I never want to go in that pool ever again.
[43:29.65]Somebody threw up in that pool and it's just mixed in there forever.
[43:34.27]Just dump chemicals in it.
[43:39.01]And then it got me thinking, how many times has this happened?
[43:43.53]Because they were very nonchalant about the whole thing.
[43:46.51]It was just like, no, no, just an hour or so.
[43:49.35]Yeah, it'd take about an hour, whatever.
[43:50.53]That happens like five times a day.
[43:54.26]How many times has somebody thrown up in the community pool?
[43:58.28]Or like shitting it or whatever.
[43:59.40]I don't know.
[44:00.34]Does that make me like a weirdo for not wanting to go in a community pool?
[44:08.16]It's a shitload of chemicals.
[44:09.88]A ton of chemicals to counteract a ton of puke and pee and shit.
[44:16.37]This probably may be 40% actual water in that pool.
[44:21.91]The rest is like made of gel with all these chemicals.
[44:25.69]And human pee.
[44:31.54]99% of people pee in pools.
[44:32.70]That's what I'm saying.
[44:37.78]And then people, whoa, what about the ocean?
[44:40.41]But the ocean's huge.
[44:42.41]I feel like diluted human pee in the ocean, you know, you're talking about like 30 decimal points to the right for what actual human pee is in the ocean.
[44:53.98]That pool is a concentrated small area.
[44:59.72]Oh, I imagine you do.
[45:02.42]But as much as I love your can-do attitude and dangerous gravitas... Would you rather have those chemicals or brown-yellow water?
[45:11.08]I don't know.
[45:12.40]What's worse?
[45:13.56]Is that how you people put it?
[45:16.48]They both suck.
[45:21.56]What is he saying?
[45:22.34]Leave her in peace.
[45:24.12]What the fuck are you talking about?
[45:25.06]Of course.
[45:26.24]I didn't mean to make assumptions.
[45:28.43]Once you subtly work out whether... Centrist.
[45:32.95]You gotta pick somebody peeing in the pool versus chemicals in the pool.
[45:41.49]Oh, what a fucking centrist.
[45:47.43]How about the pool is just normal?
[45:54.33]I think.
[45:55.21]Now, this would be interesting.
[45:57.28]If you had to sign a waiver before you got in the pool that said, Hey, uh, if I piss, shit, or puke in this pool, I have to give everybody else at the pool 20 bucks.
[46:08.85]I, I, yeah, I'd probably sign it.
[46:16.37]Because everybody has to get out of the pool, and you'd, like, ruin everybody's day.
[46:20.56]If you like diarrhea in a pool, you should have, I mean, come on.
[46:23.58]Like this should be a waiver you signed before you go to a community pool.
[46:26.22]Yes, I am not gonna throw up in the pool.
[46:27.94]And if I do, then I'm gonna pay everybody at the pool their admission fee.
[46:37.17]Because then they can't go in the pool.
[46:38.41]That's what they came there for.
[46:51.39]Imagine getting out of the pool to pee.
[46:56.11]Yeah.
[46:57.09]We got you, motherfucker.
[46:59.19]Now you're gonna... Yeah, you're gonna give us all five bucks.
[47:04.09]I bet you won't do it again.
[47:05.39]I bet you'll think twice.
[47:14.94]Imagine the look on that person's face if that like ever went through They get it's like We have pee in the pool We have a device that tells you if somebody peed and like the guys just did they're just sitting there like oh shit.
[47:28.96]They found me come on get out and they go to the ATM they have to take out like $1,500 in cash and have to walk around and hand it out to every single person and
[47:42.88]I'm sorry about this.
[47:43.90]I'm sorry I pissed in the pool.
[47:45.64]Have a great rest of your day.
[47:46.76]Happy Thanksgiving, by the way.
[47:48.66]Oh, yeah, you came here with all your kids.
[47:51.04]Yeah, they're crying because they can't swim.
[47:53.66]I'm so sorry.
[47:54.38]Here's $10.
[47:55.18]I just pissed in the pool.
[47:56.98]I'm sorry about that.
[47:57.82]My name's Frank, by the way.
[48:00.18]Oh, the couple here on their honeymoon.
[48:02.40]I'm sorry.
[48:02.94]Yeah, good to see you.
[48:03.62]I'm really, really sorry about ruining your honeymoon and shitting in the pool, but I had to go, and it was over for me to go.
[48:09.82]Have a happy Thanksgiving.
[48:20.89]Alright, listen, I gotta pay attention to the video game.
[48:32.22]Who pees in the pool here so I can block you?
[48:39.92]Do you get banned for life if you, like, piss in- if you, like, throw up in a pool?
[48:43.57]Do you have to, like, sign something?
[48:46.39]How do you get- do you get banned for life?
[48:53.67]you throw up in the pool they wipe it all out they pull you out and then they like close you behind the gates like you're never allowed back in the kingdom again pool puker psycho
[49:25.75]Don't... Stop pissing in pools.
[49:29.01]I am going to... Oh, I am... I got you all now.
[49:32.43]I got you all now.
[49:33.29]I don't care if we've hit it for another 10 minutes.
[49:35.83]Remember when everybody was talking shit to me about peeing in the shower?
[49:41.24]Every... There's a lot of people in here that seem to think that peeing in their bathtub is okay.
[49:48.42]But...
[49:49.63]Increase your bathtub size by a thousand percent and then let a bunch of other people in your bathtub While you piss in it, but that's okay So you so then you piss in the bathtub And then invite all your friends over and say let's get in let's get in the pool and
[50:20.14]I got, I got fucking, people went, people went on me hard for the like pee in the shower bit.
[50:27.26]And a bunch of you talking about how you pee in pools.
[50:32.55]I cannot believe it.
[50:40.53]Peeing in the shower is fine.
[50:41.85]Peeing in the bathtub is not.
[50:43.57]Correct.
[50:44.81]Why would you pee in the bathtub?
[50:49.97]You're lying there just... That would be disgusting, wouldn't it?
[50:54.13]Because you're surrounded by it.
[50:55.99]Give me a break.
[51:00.78]I piss in the pool from the outside.
[51:02.76]Well, I hope you got arrested.
[51:05.52]Because that's crazy.
[51:21.70]But listen, listen to me.
[51:24.00]That's crazy, right?
[51:26.58]If you were to just piss into a pool from the outside like a giant urinal, that would be the most fucked up thing you could ever do in public in a scenario where you're at the pool.
[51:37.29]But why is it when you go under the water that it's now okay for you to do the same thing?
[51:47.91]You're just getting caught in one of those scenarios.
[52:03.04]Because no one else sees it.
[52:06.66]Yeah, that's crazy.
[52:14.13]Alright.
[52:15.37]Time to reset.
[52:17.59]Reset.
[52:19.35]We have... He's just been listening to this the whole time.
[52:25.44]These are the eyes that he's giving me right now.
[52:27.76]These are the, I agree with everything you're saying, but I'm not going to speak up about what you're saying, but keep going.
[52:35.04]Keep going, Jeremy.
[52:36.64]Keep doing it.
[52:39.01]See?
[52:44.29]Those are the eyes that say, keep going.
[52:46.05]Go into the lair.
[52:47.75]Should I?
[52:48.87]Sandra, should I go into the lair?
[52:50.37]That's like the, go on.
[52:51.53]Come on, you're doing a good thing here.
[52:56.02]Alright.
[52:56.84]Rewind.
[52:57.42]Reset.
[52:58.50]A foolproof plan.
[52:59.52]If I ever heard one, I'll leave the execution to you.
[53:02.85]Really?
[53:05.79]I need MSI to stop broadcasting.
[53:07.43]You're jamming the... I found your review on a terminal in the arms building.
[53:14.30]You weren't supposed to look.
[53:15.28]I asked you to delete it.
[53:19.47]Sorry, it was open.
[53:20.27]You could have told me what was on it.
[53:21.59]Yeah, you sent me into a raptodon-infested mess to clean up after you.
[53:24.66]I didn't mean for any harm to come to you.
[53:27.66]Yeah, I read the emails.
[53:28.28]This has been my albatross.
[53:30.42]The great shame of my career.
[53:33.09]I give MSI everything.
[53:35.69]My work, my youth, my left kidney, and for years, I was a joke to them.
[53:45.53]Your left kidney.
[53:46.47]Did I... did it?
[53:47.51]Who cares what they think?
[53:49.21]You're in charge now.
[53:50.39]That's what you get for giving so much of yourself over to a corporation.
[54:12.96]You're in charge, yeah.
[54:21.72]Take it easy.
[54:22.36]You've kept the city running against all odds.
[54:24.04]Do you want a medal?
[54:25.00]You're right.
[54:25.34]This place is a garbage heap.
[54:29.92]Take it easy.
[54:30.42]Did I even say Happy Thanksgiving?
[54:42.37]I did, right?
[54:44.89]I did.
[54:45.99]Yeah.
[54:48.05]I lost all memories when I was talking about people pissing into a pool from the outside.
[54:52.07]That's where, like, I got amnesia.
[54:55.19]For, like, the last 12 hours.
[54:58.04]Alright.
[54:59.78]Should I make them stop broadcasting or should I just say, who cares?
[55:02.36]That guy bored me.
[55:03.30]I don't like, who cares?
[55:08.00]Okay, radio free.
[55:09.20]Help the broker deal.
[55:10.40]No, I have to do this.
[55:15.25]Complete the quest Errors Unseen to earn MSI's trust.
[55:22.86]The broker can't deliver the location of the chemicals until you stop MSI's transmissions.
[55:28.16]So I have to do it.
[55:29.76]Thank you again for retrieving the bolt.
[55:32.27]It's every bit as complex as I'd heard, but I'm up to the challenge.
[55:37.79]Anyway, what can I do for you?
[55:40.86]Stop broadcasting.
[55:41.90]You think we're the problem?
[55:43.74]Have you even heard the nonsense Graham is spewing?
[55:47.62]It isn't easy keeping a town like Stellar Bay afloat, especially without the board's backing.
[55:52.79]Not doing a genocide run has really hurt your reputation as a wacky streamer.
[55:58.83]You need to reach your trading partners.
[56:00.29]I'll deal with Graham.
[56:01.13]Right now I'm talking to you.
[56:03.08]My, you know how to take control of a situation, don't you?
[56:08.71]It's warm in here.
[56:09.65]Is anyone else warm?
[56:11.99]The stream just derailed for almost 15 to 20 straight minutes, talking about pissing and shitting into pools.
[56:20.06]What's a wacky, strange conversation to you guys?
[56:22.64]That was a normal conversation, apparently.
[56:24.20]No, you have to kill NPCs.
[56:39.81]You have to shoot NPC.
[56:44.79]Then it's wacky.
[56:47.94]Don't worry.
[56:48.60]I'll kill an NPC and it'll be super wacky.
[56:51.86]I promise.
[56:55.70]Alright.
[56:56.44]If we can find proof that one of the companies on board is also active on Monarch, that'll give me all the leverage I need.
[57:01.95]Fair enough.
[57:02.55]Wacky!
[57:11.74]Hey, anybody here want to get wackified?
[57:22.22]Which one?
[57:24.94]Who am I going to do it to?
[57:27.38]Your expectations just got fucking shattered.
[57:29.53]This guy.
[57:29.95]Alright, let's go do it.
[57:34.35]Error is unseen.
[57:35.17]Let's go.
[57:35.53]Recover proof of corporate presence on Monarch.
[57:38.01]That's what I'm going to do.
[57:43.04]Save it.
[57:44.62]What do I have for ammo?
[57:45.81]Give me a workbench.
[57:46.57]It's time to level up.
[57:49.41]Jerma, leveling up is not... fucking wacky.
[57:56.41]Jerma, you're supposed to play the game for 40 minutes and then spawn Deathclaws.
[58:02.07]Angry face.
[58:02.57]Alright, where's the workbench?
[58:13.92]Did I run past it?
[58:21.50]Did I run past a workbench?
[58:31.08]OH SHIT!
[58:32.06]I didn't mean to do that.
[58:39.28]I forgot, like, I'm not allowed to do that out here.
[58:41.84]Alright.
[58:52.26]Alright, where did I... There it is.
[58:55.81]Okay.
[58:59.85]Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind.
[59:03.27]Repair.
[59:04.71]How many parts do I have?
[59:05.47]I have a pretty good amount of parts.
[59:09.01]Let's tinker.
[59:11.31]This, no.
[59:12.41]This, no.
[59:13.85]Let me look at some of this new shit.
[59:15.57]This is heavy weapons.
[59:17.23]This is a flamethrower.
[59:20.15]Okay, here we go.
[59:20.85]The Vermin Hammersmith.
[59:22.63]This is a big handgun.
[59:25.84]We're going to replace this with... Yeah.
[59:29.32]This thing sucks.
[59:31.10]This is base 187 DPS.
[59:33.86]Get this off my bar.
[59:36.66]Tinker.
[59:38.64]120 is what it goes up to.
[59:41.93]It has Knockout already on it.
[59:43.33]200 DPS.
[59:46.09]Yes.
[59:48.79]213.
[59:48.97]I'm going to spend a ton of money on this.
[59:52.28]I'm just going to upgrade the hell out of it.
[59:59.12]240.
[60:00.96]253.
[60:01.46]273.
[60:01.50]That's what we're talking about.
[60:09.31]All this other junk, that's what it is.
[60:11.33]I'm not going to, like, fucking sugarcoat this.
[60:13.21]This is junk.
[60:15.05]This one is good.
[60:18.67]300.
[60:18.79]Do it again.
[60:22.96]323.
[60:22.98]Do it again.
[60:25.88]Do it again.
[60:26.66]No.
[60:26.92]That's a lot of money.
[60:33.16]No.
[60:33.60]No.
[60:33.94]Light machine gun.
[60:34.68]What is it?
[60:35.50]Just do it once.
[60:37.91]Twice.
[60:38.17]Do it again.
[60:42.37]One more time.
[60:44.99]Alright.
[60:46.57]This thing's gonna come off the bar.
[60:49.90]Repair.
[60:50.90]Let's repair everything.
[60:56.02]Not this, because fuck that thing.
[60:59.66]Yeah, fuck all this stuff.
[61:01.74]Now it's time to break down.
[61:03.05]I have two flamethrowers, just break them down.
[61:05.15]I'm not going to use that.
[61:08.99]I'm not going to use the hammer.
[61:10.75]Plasma rifle, no.
[61:13.53]Sawed-off shotgun, no.
[61:16.77]Bolt, pistol, no.
[61:19.83]Scythe, it's cool, but no.
[61:22.51]Light pistol, it's shock.
[61:25.00]No, this, I'm gonna, no.
[61:27.34]Alright.

[61:33.50]Okay, I'm using my like really, really like low voice because I'm just not trying to speak really at all.
[61:40.09]Okay, what can I do with this?
[61:41.69]So I can do power, plasma, not plasma.
[61:48.53]Magnum.
[61:49.99]Range weapon mod magazine increases the amount of ammunition the weapon's magazine carries.
[61:58.58]50% magazine size.
[61:59.42]That's pretty huge.
[62:01.28]Zap.
[62:04.30]Zap or... What's in there now?
[62:08.31]Nothing.
[62:09.73]I think I'm gonna do... I think I'm gonna do Zap.
[62:12.75]Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[62:16.09]Makes it shock damage.
[62:22.18]It's in.
[62:23.88]Can I have more than one?
[62:24.86]No, that's the barrel.
[62:27.22]I need a barrel modification.
[62:30.82]Shit.
[62:32.68]Alright, what's in there now?
[62:34.62]Mag 2 power exacto site.

[62:51.79]Chat's bored?
[62:55.63]What do you want me to do about it?
[62:57.64]Scream at him?
[62:59.06]Tell him to settle down?
[63:03.24]Talk about pools?
[63:05.68]Something wacky!
[63:11.08]You have to be a wacky streamer!
[63:17.59]now I'm trying to figure out if this game's good alright I'm trying to figure it out it's tough no I'm not doing anything wacky we need organic wacky not manufactured wacky I only work on organic wackiness okay I don't want to store bot wackiness I want it to be organic from the source
[63:51.43]Gluten free.
[63:53.87]Alright, I've leveled up.
[63:54.49]What do I have for ammo?
[64:01.04]Nice.
[64:01.40]Alright, so that's poison, fire.
[64:05.20]These things have better damage.
[64:06.74]Get this out of here.
[64:07.84]What should I replace this with?
[64:12.28]Flamethrower?
[64:14.93]Shock cannon?
[64:19.01]Maybe just keep this with poison.
[64:24.60]Yeah, I'll just keep it for the poison.
[64:26.78]Just in case I have some kind of issue with it.
[64:28.86]I only have 197 shots.
[64:30.26]Let's get some ammo.
[64:34.17]Wacky.
[64:37.03]Fucking wacky.
[64:38.15]Alright, I need... I need a vendor.
[64:50.87]Vendor!
[64:52.63]Like you!
[64:59.15]Will you guys stop huffing and puffing so much?
[65:03.25]You're at, like, Thanksgiving dinner right now.
[65:08.89]You're gonna upset your whole family.
[65:10.59]Okay.
[65:26.29]You got me on speaker.
[65:28.60]I'm at the dinner table like we were saying before.
[65:30.24]It's just silent.
[65:33.14]Just quiet.
[65:33.76]Nobody's talking.
[65:34.32]There's like 15 people at your dinner.
[65:37.68]You just hear the clang of... ...of plates and knives.
[65:44.78]No one's talking.
[65:47.79]After about 10 straight minutes of me just doing this, of me playing the game and not doing anything...
[65:53.78]Uncle fucking Roger just says, That's it!
[65:59.38]He hasn't done anything wacky!
[66:01.06]Turn him off!
[66:04.44]And then it's like, Everyone lets go of their utensils.
[66:09.97]He's right.
[66:12.95]And then you chime in, Yeah, sorry, I thought he was going to be funny today.
[66:16.57]Then mom chimes in, I'm so sorry everyone's dinner is ruined.
[66:24.49]And then dad chimes in, I wasn't a fan of his from the very beginning and you brought him into my home?
[66:32.91]And then after a few more pieces of deliberation of talking about how unfunny I am, you come together as a family.
[66:41.81]Yeah, he sucks, he's not funny at all.
[66:44.31]I know, he's small too.
[66:47.66]And then everybody at the dinner table is like, Dad, that was a good one, that was good.
[66:54.98]And he's streaming on Thanksgiving?
[66:57.52]Like, grandpa's like, yeah, I know how to show.
[66:59.16]I know how to show.
[67:01.26]And then grandpa, like, grabs his chest.
[67:06.30]And he goes, ah!
[67:14.58]And everyone's like, what?
[67:15.34]Whoa.
[67:15.98]And then grandpa goes, I just, you made it.
[67:19.09]Bro!
[67:22.65]Everybody, and then you just turn me off and you enjoy your Thanksgiving.
[67:29.83]And you all come together and everybody is so happy and it was because of me.
[67:39.50]So I'm okay with this.
[67:42.45]I'm fine with that.
[67:43.57]I actually prefer it.
[67:57.39]I didn't realize my face cam was on.
[67:59.29]What are you talking about?
[68:00.95]What the fuck are you talking about?
[68:06.92]What?
[68:08.94]I'm bringing families together this Thanksgiving.
[68:11.24]Alright, I can just teleport here.
[68:18.11]So what are these both for?
[68:19.51]Let's just go here, UDL lab.
[68:30.50]Oh, the research.
[68:31.60]The research.
[68:37.67]Who's Catherine?
[68:49.76]Oh, this weapon is sick.
[68:56.31]Let's rewind a day when I said that handguns sucked.
[69:00.71]That was not true.
[69:02.66]Okay, here we go.
[69:03.86]Research.
[69:06.74]I think I'm going to need something.
[69:11.38]Up there.
[69:13.36]He saw the ladder.
[69:15.18]Pepe hands, finally.
[69:16.35]Oops.
[69:35.87]The Marauder Ringleader.
[69:42.95]Oh, you're bigger than I thought.
[69:48.77]Is there somebody next to me?
[69:51.08]There is somebody next to me, burning me!
[70:06.07]Thanksgiving.
[70:07.91]Oh, how exhausting would a wacky Thanksgiving be if you had to go to, like, Uncle Jeremy's and it was, like, just themed with, like, party balloons and everything was wacky and there was, like, jokes and shit.
[70:20.56]You'd probably be exhausted.
[70:21.86]Alright, I got the key.
[70:37.89]Mom, I really don't want to go to Uncle Jeremy's for Thanksgiving.
[70:41.11]He does this, like, he's just, he does this annoying shit.
[70:45.47]Can I just go with my friends?
[70:52.34]We all have to, like, pretend to laugh while he does, like, his routine.
[70:58.32]Research data.
[70:59.84]Okay.
[71:00.12]Uh, rich sulfur pockets made Monarch a prime site for testing and experimentation.
[71:06.06]Early results show promise.
[71:08.34]but further research is necessary.
[71:11.30]UDL disavows all knowledge and responsibility for lorem ipsum.
[71:16.47]All data in this report is considered proprietary knowledge of UDL.
[71:22.05]Recorded it.
[71:24.89]What?
[71:26.09]Who's Catherine?
[71:30.53]Who is Catherine?
[71:32.03]I don't know.
[71:34.15]Alright, cool.
[71:35.71]Messages.
[71:37.11]Screenshot that one.
[71:42.53]Log in.
[71:45.11]Ooh.
[71:46.26]If Valdez wants a better title, see how she likes these.
[71:49.60]She's going to be furious if she ever finds this list, and I'm not covering for you.
[71:52.78]Make sure these are good and hidden.
[71:55.52]Eggs Mayhem, Thunderdog, Skunk Parade, Fuck You Valdez, and I Want My Rays.
[72:02.53]Hmm.
[72:09.41]Alright.
[72:12.40]Alright, I gotta start deleting shit.
[72:13.94]I gotta break, um, what am I, 154?
[72:15.70]What do I not need?
[72:19.48]Okay, this is, this is completely broken.
[72:22.45]Okay.
[72:23.95]24 armor parts!
[72:30.89]I was at one.
[72:31.65]Alright, I could have so much more armor.
[72:46.10]He's got a wacky mask on.
[72:47.48]Alright.
[72:49.32]So I got this return to Sandjar with the data cartridge.
[72:54.23]Let's go.
[72:56.59]Still can't run.
[72:57.23]I didn't destroy anything.
[72:59.75]I want to break down something heavy.
[73:02.75]This thing's pretty damn heavy.
[73:03.97]How many planes?
[73:04.45]I got two plane throwers.
[73:05.81]Who gives a... Alright.
[73:11.74]Bathroom.
[73:13.22]Cool.
[73:15.21]Terminals.
[73:16.31]Cool.
[73:20.83]Energy cells.
[73:22.81]Fast travel back.
[73:24.39]We've completed our quest.
[73:30.01]No copypasta.
[73:31.21]No copypasta.
[73:43.42]Fuck you.
[73:44.38]Hey.
[73:49.26]That's not very nice.
[73:59.74]I did it!
[74:02.10]I have found a data cartridge with details.
[74:04.54]Excellent timing on your part.
[74:06.28]I worked my fingers to nubs, but I finally completed the Bolt 52 form.
[74:10.96]I dare say it will be my second greatest achievement after the Reformations.
[74:16.57]What is this link?
[74:19.91]What?
[74:21.21]Hold on.
[74:25.73]What the hell did you do to me?
[74:29.99]Facecam.
[74:39.41]That's what I would look like if I put on a bunch of prosthetics.
[74:43.04]Turn the facecam off.
[74:44.04]I did.
[74:44.44]I know.
[74:44.96]I was, like, pissing everybody off with my facecam.
[74:47.10]Alright.
[74:48.12]Give him the data.
[74:49.38]Not so fast.
[74:50.04]Oh, what are these reformations you're talking about?
[74:53.06]Oh, what, are you going to reformat everyone's files?
[74:55.42]Oh, did I say I had data cartridge?
[74:56.70]That's just what I call my left nut.
[75:00.25]That seems unnecessarily complicated.
[75:03.75]It's actually very funny, sir.
[75:05.07]Thank you.
[75:05.83]Now I'm confused.
[75:07.07]Do you have evidence against UDL or not?
[75:11.50]Oh.
[75:12.12]Alright, here you go.
[75:12.70]Cool.
[75:12.80]MSI Elite Armor.
[75:13.14]Did I just get a motherboard?
[75:41.45]I feel like that's the name of one of the MSI Elite Gaming Armor Edition.
[75:46.19]Alright, let me see what that is.
[75:58.20]Alright, buddy.
[75:59.30]I have 117 lying.
[76:00.22]I don't need to go more than that.
[76:03.60]I'm overlying.

[76:55.12]Okay, shut up 50 less weight, okay, uh, what do I want to do?
[77:06.81]Fast travel well, no, that's stupid
[77:09.07]You just... This perk is... I think the... It just should delete it and replace it with anything else.
[77:15.83]It's so easy just to break down anything to just be able to fast travel and sell everything.
[77:20.08]Why would you ever use this?
[77:21.86]This is 100% useless.
[77:27.40]Turn off the face cam.
[77:28.30]Not staying on.
[77:31.78]Uh... Science weapon.
[77:37.42]This is not bad.
[77:39.95]Six-bit movement penalty to accuracy.
[77:41.65]That's pretty good, too.
[77:42.67]I'll do this one.
[77:54.52]Alright, you guys have points, too.
[77:56.82]Tier 3.
[77:59.66]Companion ability damage?
[78:01.22]No.
[78:02.79]Swaps weapons and reloads faster.
[78:05.82]When Ellie is in the party, any damage that would kill you instead heals a small amount of health.
[78:10.38]Yeah.
[78:10.88]Okay.
[78:18.45]Plus 20% damage to creatures.
[78:20.69]Yeah.
[78:22.65]And let's get you something better.
[78:23.83]These weapons are terrible.
[78:25.13]I need to get you something better.
[78:29.61]Actually, you... Yeah, that's actually better.
[78:34.13]Whatever.
[78:36.38]Wait, now I can't die.
[78:37.46]I mean, maybe not immediately.
[78:39.74]Okay.
[78:42.89]So now... You found a way to end MSI's transmissions.
[78:52.65]Mm-hmm.
[78:55.16]I did.
[78:55.40]Graham.
[78:57.58]Graham.
[79:02.19]Okay, I gotta sell or break down.
[79:04.45]Let's break down.
[79:06.07]Let me take a look at my armor because I'm very killable right now.
[79:13.80]Where's my MSI Elite motherboard?
[79:16.04]There it is.
[79:16.46]I mean, look at this thing.
[79:21.38]It's an MSI Elite gamer board.
[79:24.34]Why would I take this off?
[79:33.19]Skeletal Adreno Simulator.
[79:35.85]Geographic Scanner.
[79:39.28]Plus five all skills.
[79:43.34]You're no longer the dentist, you're now the dentist's chair.
[79:46.76]I'm okay with that.
[79:47.74]That fits into the lore.
[79:57.43]What is this, 38?
[80:01.17]This is so much better.
[80:03.91]Now I'm not gonna die instantly.
[80:08.92]It came with a helmet.
[80:11.76]It did?
[80:12.98]Where's the MSI Elite helmet?
[80:16.55]It's not this, is it?
[80:18.33]No.
[80:24.74]This is quite the dentist chair.
[80:27.44]I don't think I'd wanna sit in a robot's lap and lie back on the robot's body.
[80:41.09]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[80:44.17]Alright, where's the MSI Elite?
[80:47.45]Look at that.
[80:48.39]Now I'm a real Elite gaming chair.
[80:56.98]Range weapon spread minus 10%.
[80:59.95]Why would I put this on?
[81:04.85]Inspiration.
[81:06.35]Line.
[81:09.21]One-handed melee.
[81:10.03]Is there one-handed stealth skills?
[81:11.77]Block.
[81:12.87]Tech skills.
[81:14.23]Block.
[81:15.53]Lockpick plus 5.
[81:19.96]Long guns plus 7.
[81:21.62]That's really good.
[81:24.59]Perception engineering.
[81:26.45]I'll keep it on for now.
[81:30.89]My chat, why is my chat not loading?
[81:34.83]I don't know, that's weird.
[81:35.77]I didn't even delete anything.
[81:38.17]Alright, it's time to get rid of... Well, I have some heavy ass shit that I want to get rid of.
[81:45.56]Okay, how about this one?
[81:46.26]This thing's heavy.
[81:48.32]Just junk it.
[81:51.44]Break it down.
[81:55.14]Uh, get rid of this.
[81:58.40]Get rid of the goggles.
[81:59.34]No, the goggles are fine.
[82:00.94]This is a one pound.
[82:03.98]What do I have that's taking up so much weight?
[82:05.70]Am I just holding a bunch of creams?
[82:08.22]What's the heaviest thing I have?
[82:09.50]And why do I have so many heavy ass things?
[82:15.80]Okay, it's these.
[82:18.48]Plasma launcher.
[82:21.30]I'm not going to use this.
[82:24.88]The scythe, I'm not going to use it.
[82:26.74]It's cool, but I'm not going to use it.
[82:28.60]This pistol, not going to use it.
[82:32.10]Okay, now we're doing alright.
[82:34.58]Sort by weight.
[82:38.36]Sort by weight.
[82:39.14]This thing's five pounds.
[82:44.26]Sort by weight.
[82:47.93]Oh, I have a bunch of, like, raptor meat.
[82:50.71]Alright, just fucking get rid of it.
[82:52.47]Wait.
[82:53.25]Base health plus 25% in two minutes.
[82:54.80]Eat one.
[82:57.70]Just... I don't care.
[82:59.02]Eat them all.
[83:00.32]Eat a bag of flour, too.
[83:04.84]Meat and flour.
[83:05.90]What a good diet.
[83:06.60]Alright, I'm good.
[83:07.28]Let's go.
[83:07.60]Let's go back to Graham and tell him all the news.
[83:15.66]Jerma, read this message.
[83:16.72]Are you okay?
[83:17.42]I'm fine.
[83:17.88]What are you talking about?
[83:27.49]Alright.
[83:29.11]Amber Heights.
[83:34.49]If you can't read chat, then you can't read my messages once per stream on average, so why am I even here?
[83:42.93]What?
[83:43.13]I ought to mention
[83:46.03]The Iconoclasts are loyal folk.
[83:48.21]If you're right, they'll do the same.
[83:50.09]Turn on them, they'll open fire without a second thought.
[83:53.11]Just like me.
[83:54.71]What a great adversary.
[83:56.28]How many good folk are we going to lose to our mission?
[83:59.74]That's just the way of it.
[84:01.04]We've got to earn our keep out here.
[84:03.22]That don't mean we ought to be following her into the jaws of a manticore.
[84:06.68]Would you rather sit on your thumbs and starve?
[84:09.67]No.
[84:10.23]All I'm saying is she's got to be more careful throwing away lives.
[84:15.07]I'm on your side.
[84:16.65]Just so you know.
[84:23.47]Alright, what do we got?
[84:24.51]Free flower.
[84:27.89]No, just stop picking.
[84:28.71]I'm not even eating this stuff.
[84:32.08]I'm just hoarding.
[84:32.86]What are you playing?
[84:33.30]Monopoly?
[84:35.38]Cool.
[84:40.32]I don't even smoke.
[84:40.98]Why am I picking?
[84:41.50]I'm just a weirdo.
[84:42.20]I pick up everything.
[84:44.02]Okay, save it here.
[84:45.63]Yeah, we felled it, mind.
[84:48.77]But we lost two runners and five gunheads.
[84:53.15]A total failure, then.
[84:55.20]So much for the ruins.
[84:57.18]And hell only knows where the Vanoys are.
[84:59.76]They never showed.
[85:01.68]I'm sure they're... Ah, let's talk later.
[85:04.94]It seems we have... A stranger comes to my home.
[85:08.44]Oh, this is the guy that was speaking into the teleprompter.
[85:11.42]If you're looking for a teacher, I am one.
[85:15.21]Welcome to the iconoclasts.
[85:18.92]What do you teach?
[85:19.48]I'm told you're out of pamphlets.
[85:21.28]That's a shame.
[85:21.84]This is Amber Heights.
[85:22.54]I expected more altars or incense or both.
[85:26.12]I just need you to stop using Devil's Peak.
[85:28.50]Let's get right out to it and just jump right on the issue at hand.
[85:31.97]Stop?
[85:33.25]No.
[85:34.57]Spreading the truth is the only way to combat the board's poisonous campaign of propaganda against their people.
[85:42.55]Your broadcasts aren't working.
[85:43.71]Nobody's listening.
[85:45.36]You really think the board is going to let its citizens listen to your propaganda?
[85:50.20]Nobody's listening to your broadcasts.
[85:51.60]No.
[85:51.74]Sorry.
[85:51.94]You're only transmitting on a single radio frequency, and very few people can actually receive it.
[85:56.66]This is not even a lie, this is a science.
[86:13.58]I'm just telling this guy the truth.
[86:15.45]Graham, we should be focusing on survival anyway.
[86:19.23]Food, ammo, and medicine.
[86:21.67]Maybe now is the time to pivot.
[86:24.07]Pivot, huh?
[86:25.81]If radio isn't working, we might try another way.
[86:30.39]It seems the captain's timing is more than just serendipitous.
[86:33.80]It must be fate.
[86:35.59]I've had my sights on an old printing press for some time.
[86:39.13]The board uses magazines and advertisements to subtly focus the colony's attention.
[86:43.77]No, those are all things you should not ever be doing.
[86:49.15]That's all terrible advice.
[86:51.15]Don't do that.
[86:51.87]Hey, here's how you get its attention.
[86:58.25]Do all these things that you shouldn't be doing and do them all in a row.
[87:03.97]What?
[87:05.15]No, don't do those things.
[87:09.61]Help me clear out and repair the press, and I'll have no need for that rust bucket of a tower.
[87:18.55]That's too much work.
[87:19.15]I'll just kill you now and be done with it.
[87:23.90]If you want to get his attention, just use the fish emoji.
[87:27.48]That's pretty true.
[87:29.18]That's pretty close.
[87:30.30]Hold on, you're saying you want to print propaganda in their magazines?
[87:33.12]You might actually have better reach.
[87:34.90]People read that stuff all over the system, even in Byzantium.
[87:39.41]You see, citizens of Halcyon are glued to their periodicals.
[87:43.49]Even I find myself occasionally distracted by their... Fish propaganda.
[87:47.45]...shameful quality of editing and unacceptable disregard for grammatical structure.
[87:52.46]My literary prowess will hook them and the eternal truth will reel them in.
[87:58.63]What's into me?
[87:59.83]I'm starting to sound like one of Sanjar's fishermen.
[88:01.83]Wait, what did he say?
[88:05.25]Oh, he said, I comprehended what you just said.
[88:08.83]Cool.
[88:10.41]Entirely.
[88:12.71]Alright, I'll help.
[88:14.51]You're starting to sound like a bitter writer.
[88:21.30]Alright, fine.
[88:22.00]Wonderful.
[88:23.30]I requisitioned replacement rollers for it some time ago.
[88:26.12]Huxley should have delivered them yesterday.
[88:28.66]Speaking of which, where is Huxley?
[88:31.42]Uh, well, sir, they'll be dead in about ten minutes when, uh, Jerma Wacky 985 Elbertson takes care of them and brings a ring back to prove that they existed.
[88:40.75]Huxley's still recovering.
[88:42.79]She won't be up for a run for a while yet.
[88:45.57]It seems we're out a runner.
[88:47.63]If you intend to help our cause, I'll ask you to meet our MSI supplier in her stead.
[88:52.41]Yeah, it's called spread out 10, give 10% support to everybody.
[89:03.62]Now everybody, everybody, I'm just playing every single field.
[89:12.88]Oh, you get 10% support.
[89:14.16]You get 10% support.
[89:15.36]You get 10% support.
[89:17.32]Little did I know, I'm just collecting bits.
[89:19.50]I'm just collecting bits the whole time.
[89:32.67]My master plan.
[89:34.11]Oh, the runner from the northern ruins.
[89:35.75]I helped her get out of there.
[89:36.69]Wait, isn't she dead?
[89:39.83]Wait.
[89:42.50]Where's the supplier?
[89:43.16]She meets us in the ruins of Bayside Terrace.
[89:45.90]From our compound, follow the road north.
[89:47.72]I'm a mercenary.
[89:51.58]I'm a mercenary for hire.
[89:53.26]People are just making me do tasks.
[90:01.24]So you're her mysterious savior.
[90:03.72]She sings your praises.
[90:05.26]No, I don't want you to sing my praises.
[90:06.63]No, I'm a mercenary.
[90:07.61]So eager to learn.
[90:08.51]So bright-eyed.
[90:09.43]So tone-deaf.
[90:15.36]Alright, I'll be back.
[90:15.98]I want one of your pens.
[90:18.08]Oh, I won't do it.
[90:18.95]I want one of your pens.
[90:34.36]Give me one of those.
[90:35.98]What do you mean?
[90:36.48]Get high capacity cartridges or extra supplies.
[90:38.66]What else do you need?
[90:39.86]Would anybody like a coffee?
[90:40.74]What do you want?
[90:59.11]Just, alright, just text me the order of the entire village.
[91:01.81]And I'll, it's gonna be a pain in the ass, but I'm gonna have to get, like, three trays.
[91:05.58]My god.
[91:06.62]I'm taking these.
[91:07.14]I don't care.
[91:07.70]Don't look.
[91:15.08]Fine.
[91:18.78]The commuter.
[91:20.58]Wait, this is a faction quest?
[91:28.15]Fine.
[91:29.89]Fine.
[91:32.11]Fine.
[91:35.07]I'll show you guys that I'm not just a dentist for hire.
[91:39.87]I'm much more than that.
[91:42.67]Dentist, the centrist.
[92:04.58]Is that supposed to be like Dennis the Menace?
[92:11.75]You stopped being a dentist the second you became a gamer chair.
[92:19.49]Wait a minute.
[92:21.42]I hear something.
[92:35.82]Ooh, I like that revolver reload animation.
[92:46.63]Dentist.
[92:47.39]No, wouldn't Sam the robot be the dentist chair?
[92:50.19]I'm just taking the place of the robot.
[93:09.05]is there a reason why every video game that's one of these open kind of rpgs takes place at some point where we've only developed our media to be 1940s jingles it's like this weird look it's like the 1940s but it's not it's like 2000 it's like 4 000 a.d
[93:30.72]I don't know.
[93:31.28]I mean, I guess it's all cool, but why is it every... Why does it always have to just be like, hey, we're singing jingles like the 30s?
[93:39.54]They would have not developed media past this old-ass TV shit?
[93:44.49]Alright, who's... Expired copyright.
[93:59.74]Alright, we're good.
[94:01.91]That's 300 and fucking 40 damage.
[94:06.35]It's only open for public domain media.
[94:09.07]Oh, you still have to make the song.
[94:16.39]It follows that same formula of, like, high octave singing quickly about a product.
[94:30.10]Now you can say, what about McDonald's?
[94:31.26]They do like, ba-da-ba-ba.
[94:32.78]That's not the same.
[94:36.48]If it was, if that was true, it would be like... McDonald's!
[94:42.26]McDonald's!
[94:43.04]The delicious burgers!
[94:44.50]McDonald's!
[94:45.48]Happy clowns!
[94:48.32]That would be more in line with what it was.
[94:53.09]They all follow that same formula.
[95:02.42]Okay, where the fuck am I going?
[95:04.54]The wrong way.
[95:07.06]Am I dumb?
[95:20.55]Am I dumb?
[95:21.19]What's going on here?
[95:21.95]Oh.
[95:26.11]It's sealed.
[95:26.71]Why is this sealed?
[95:36.65]Can I sneak?
[95:46.77]No, you almost died.
[95:48.79]Don't ever stand in the way.
[95:50.45]What are you, stupid?
[95:51.81]Don't just stand.
[95:52.51]Okay, I'll leave.
[96:07.64]Wow, I just got a headshot
[96:41.89]Let me see your head.
[96:44.68]Don't blame me.
[96:46.00]Blame your doorman.
[96:47.80]This wouldn't happen.
[96:51.36]A little bit of customer service would have prevented all of this.
[97:04.51]Okay.
[97:06.17]You in here?
[97:15.28]Don't worry don't worry ma'am.
[97:19.16]We took care of it the intruders are dead open the door A lot of dead folk out here.
[97:29.94]I'm guessing there was a tragic accident Yeah, well
[97:39.98]I happen to be a guy that... You know... I'm just doing... Yeah, that's Homer Simpson.
[97:44.94]I gotta stop.
[97:45.96]I'm Junko.
[97:46.76]Graham sent me to collect supplies.
[97:49.46]Just your friendly neighborhood.
[97:50.98]Iconoclast.
[97:51.66]Doesn't matter who I am.
[97:52.40]I'm here to pick up Graham's supplies.
[97:53.92]Graham sent me.
[97:55.66]Awesome.
[97:56.98]Finally.
[97:57.96]Tell Graham that this is the last run I'm doing.
[97:59.54]Sondra has declared a stop sale to you lot.
[98:03.32]But even if he hadn't, I'm not risking my neck anymore.
[98:11.78]do it no do it oh hello thanks for clearing out those goons please don't kill me next you asked real nice rollers and watsits right I won't for a printing press here take them like I said this is my last run
[98:38.63]Why have you been helping Graham?
[98:39.73]It's an enviable thing he's doing.
[98:42.07]Free people and all that.
[98:44.19]I can't live that way.
[98:45.85]I need my structure.
[98:47.64]But I respect the iconoclasts for doing it.
[98:51.76]Jerma, please kill a person.
[98:54.16]I just killed like ten people.
[98:56.54]And the guy at the front door who just told me to leave.
[98:59.46]You just want me to kill this person?
[99:04.69]No, I don't have a reason to kill this person.
[99:07.81]I am a honorable that an honorable person that does dishonorable things that's what it says on my dnd character sheet you'd have to ask him all I know is that if I get caught I'll get arrested
[99:26.97]Where would they get their supplies now?
[99:28.03]No, what would that actually put me at?
[99:31.36]So... Okay, so I do what I want, and I do the things that I want to do.
[99:35.88]I'm dishonorable, but I do honorable things.
[99:37.40]But I still look both ways when I cross the street.
[99:57.51]Right?
[99:58.31]I'll... That makes me a coward.
[100:01.99]What do you mean a coward?
[100:03.69]What?
[100:04.54]That's a sensible... A centrist dentist coward.
[100:15.13]Alright.
[100:19.71]Do you have any extra food?
[100:26.49]See?
[100:26.85]Delivering the extra food and supplies to the people that are in need at that village, but then headshotting this person before they leave the room.
[100:36.92]Never mind.
[100:37.82]That makes me a... I brought the supplies back.
[100:50.80]Alright, don't just take everything.
[100:51.70]Alright, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[100:56.48]This is a big one.
[100:58.70]This makes you an idiot.
[101:04.36]Music box.
[101:11.96]Revolver MK2 troop helmet.
[101:14.20]Wooden parts.
[101:14.86]Adreno.
[101:17.48]Do you guys want some of this?
[101:19.13]Too bad, it's mine!
[101:32.30]Jeremy.
[101:32.64]Jeremy.
[101:33.78]Jeremy.
[101:38.06]Jeremy.
[101:40.25]You can't.
[101:40.69]Jeremy.
[101:42.09]Jeremy.
[101:42.35]What?
[101:45.45]I'm sorry.
[101:46.03]You can't just take everything.
[101:51.75]Fine.
[101:52.43]God.
[101:54.91]I'm not going to use it anyway.
[102:05.21]Okay, where are we going?
[102:07.05]The commuter.
[102:07.83]Bring the needed parts back to Graham at Amber Heights.
[102:09.97]I'm encumbered.
[102:11.19]I have to get rid of this.
[102:14.76]Whatever.
[102:15.98]162.
[102:16.52]Break it down.
[102:17.22]Millionaire streamer.
[102:20.88]Steals from the needy.
[102:22.32]No.
[102:24.82]Gives food to people in the community.
[102:27.52]And then takes everything from the person's house that they were just in.
[102:32.03]But I'm not bringing that stuff to the community.
[102:33.95]I'm bringing the food to the community, the good thing, and then I'm just taking everything from this person's house.
[102:41.13]Holy shit, that's kind of good.
[102:44.13]That's really good.
[102:53.22]Plasma.
[102:54.16]I'm never going to use this stuff.
[102:55.94]I'm really not.
[102:56.76]It's just the truth.
[103:00.83]It's just the truth, and you all know it.
[103:07.71]Yeah, you all know it.
[103:09.87]I know it, you know it.
[103:11.72]Everybody does.
[103:16.48]Two-handed melee.
[103:17.44]No one's going to use this.
[103:20.61]Restricted area requires ID.
[103:22.23]ID.
[103:29.59]I don't know shit.
[103:30.25]Yes, you do.
[103:32.43]Don't ever think that.
[103:33.13]There's definitely something that you know more of than I do.
[103:37.49]Come on.
[103:41.71]I mean, it is pretty rare, but you might know something a little more than me.
[103:54.96]Ego.
[103:57.54]Ego.
[103:57.78]His ego is inflating.
[103:59.94]Pop that fucking ego balloon quick.
[104:17.20]Alright, let's go deliver the supplies.
[104:20.32]Hey!
[104:20.88]Hey!
[104:22.70]How are you?
[104:27.34]Wait, on the pool thing.
[104:29.30]What if you get diarrhea poisoned in the pool?
[104:32.06]Do you still have to pay?
[104:33.12]What do you mean?
[104:33.78]Do you mean somebody, like, poisoned you?
[104:35.36]We're, like, 20, 30 minutes away from that.
[104:42.48]They don't just abandon orders, and they weren't at the ruins.
[104:45.92]Where in this sulfur-sodden hellhole did you send them?
[104:49.97]They're on a very important... Ah, we'll continue this later.
[104:54.41]Welcome back, Captain.
[104:56.93]Got your rollers.
[104:58.98]The rest of your account went to food and medicine.
[105:01.52]Thank you.
[105:01.96]Well...
[105:16.01]We've got bad news.
[105:17.49]Sanjar has made it illegal to sell to you guys.
[105:20.63]That is most unfortunate.
[105:22.89]I don't know what to say, but I'm just a messenger.
[105:28.32]Sanjar, old friend, you're about to cross a dangerous line.
[105:32.82]About to?
[105:34.12]That idiot just declared war.
[105:36.64]Hold on.
[105:38.14]We will deal with his subversion later.
[105:40.16]Wait, hold on a minute.
[105:41.52]For now, we must redouble our efforts to spread the truth to the colony.
[105:47.52]uh what's next I've already sent a team ahead to scout the press one of our best meet them there and find out if they've been successful okay you sent the vanoys there didn't you oh for fuck's sake graham we needed them in the ruins our people died out there
[106:05.75]They weren't willing to fight for our cause.
[106:08.13]We need reinforcements.
[106:09.69]We need new recruits.
[106:11.29]The van Noyes saw the printing facility with the same importance as I. So I have to prepare the... The hell's the sense in recruiting if you're just going to get them killed?
[106:18.44]I have to prepare the press?
[106:19.56]I have the utmost confidence in their... I just want to make sure I'm clear on what I have to do.
[106:22.96]Friends, we must have faith that the men and women we recruit can handle the duties for which we recruit them.
[106:30.44]Spreading the word has to be priority number one, otherwise how can this movement grow?
[106:33.51]You could have sent them after backing Zora up, right?
[106:36.31]You two ever stop bickering?
[106:38.95]This is worth bickering over.
[106:40.79]The Iconoclasts can't keep their heads in the ground forever, or they're going to starve and die slow.
[106:47.37]Look, just... If the Vanoys are still alive, get them out of there.
[106:52.77]With Sanjar pressing the issue like this, I have a feeling we'll need them.
[106:59.49]Uh, the printing press comes first.
[107:02.23]No promises.
[107:03.87]The printing press comes first.
[107:07.46]Retrieve Zora's team and repair the printing press.
[107:10.74]You got it.
[107:16.78]How you liking that new model of the, uh, leapfrog?
[107:19.68]1200.
[107:21.96]You learning your math?
[107:29.90]Okay, I'll let you go to it.
[107:31.08]Am I still over-encumbered?
[107:44.20]Who are you?
[107:50.81]Hold on.
[107:51.17]I don't know what the fuck is happening.
[107:53.83]Something hurts.
[107:54.65]Ow!
[107:59.17]I don't know.
[107:59.47]I can't.
[108:00.17]I'm just coming over here.
[108:01.03]Why?

[108:32.03]So much junk.
[108:35.19]Alright, you know what this reminds me of?
[108:36.35]I feel like I've been deleting a bunch of stuff, but it's still... So you ever cleaned out your hard drive before?
[108:41.56]And you're like, how do I only have like 4 gigs left on a 500 gig drive?
[108:46.10]And you go through and you do everything.
[108:47.32]And you delete shit you don't need and don't want, but somehow you've only recovered like 5 gigs?
[108:53.28]And you're like, this is not even fucking possible.
[108:54.98]How?
[108:55.24]Where is this stuff coming from?
[108:56.36]5, 10, 15, 20, 23rd.
[109:05.09]Is it the bananas?
[109:10.37]It's like all this stuff, all these apples and cranberries and... Alright, I'm getting rid of it.
[109:24.48]Alright, alright, I'm getting rid of it.
[109:26.40]Okay, I got rid of it.

[129:48.82]Don't be a fool.
[129:56.65]Do you hear that?
[129:57.91]It's the blessed sound of radio silence, which leads me to believe you have sweet, sweet news for me.
[130:02.65]I do.
[130:06.99]MSI and the iconoclast are no longer transmitting.
[130:08.89]Is the data ready?
[130:11.09]Yes, indeed.
[130:12.55]I am back in business.
[130:14.87]But before we get down to it, might I ask how you handled the problem?
[130:19.08]None of your business.
[130:21.14]Does it matter?
[130:22.28]Job's done.
[130:23.08]Thank you.
[130:23.50]I couldn't have said it better myself.
[130:27.77]I hoped both MSI and the Iconoclast get what they wanted.
[130:30.73]You're an information broker.
[130:31.89]If you want to know, it'll cost you.
[130:35.23]Oh, I believe it will.
[130:36.65]But the price I pay won't be to you.
[130:38.87]No, we've a bigger deal to settle.
[130:41.57]I don't doubt that you are working with Phineas, but my contract specifies I relate any acquired information to the purchaser, and to the purchaser alone.
[130:50.59]However, if you send the data, I will need your assistance in cycling the antenna's receiver.
[130:55.33]Everyone always needs you to do something.
[130:58.84]Like, okay.
[131:02.78]How'd he hook up with you?
[131:04.62]Tell me how to fix it.
[131:05.38]And I bet I have a whole new checklist of crap to do before it works, right?
[131:09.75]Do it yourself.
[131:10.49]First, I never leave the tower.
[131:12.29]No exceptions.
[131:13.61]Well, you will be in a body bag.
[131:15.19]This is a multi-person endeavor.
[131:16.35]In about ten minutes, you don't do it yourself.
[131:17.51]I need to be here to key in the sequence to the tower system when it resets, or the calibration will fail.
[131:22.69]Normally, I'd beg Neoka to do the honors, but it appears she's following your lead now.
[131:27.93]If that is not what I have to do, if that's not it, then this guy's gonna die.
[131:31.15]Just press the lever outside.
[131:32.27]Okay.
[131:32.37]That's it?
[131:51.19]Someone has trust issues.
[131:53.03]Though I can't hardly feign surprise.
[131:55.17]Yes, that is all.
[131:56.33]No, I am not mocking you.
[131:58.41]Much.
[131:59.85]Just step outside.
[132:01.19]He's gonna lock the door on me.
[132:01.95]Flip the switch.
[132:02.73]Depart forever.
[132:03.89]Understood?
[132:04.92]Good.
[132:05.46]Marvelous.
[132:05.90]We're in agreement.
[132:07.56]This is why I stopped helping out around here.
[132:08.92]He's gonna close the door and lock it.
[132:10.16]It's always throw this lever.
[132:11.76]Shoot that marauder.
[132:12.84]Save my life.
[132:13.94]Just one thing after another with you.
[132:15.40]I love when games... Are self-referential on anything to do...
[132:21.96]Don't burst a blood vessel, I'll give whatever.
[132:23.84]It's hard to not do it.
[132:27.98]Alright, just press the button.
[132:29.59]You don't know that I have time travel mechanics.
[132:44.90]See, right now, I just put a time travel spot right here.
[132:47.78]Because if you close the door and lock it on me, I'm just going to time travel back and kill you.
[132:58.88]Alright, let's see what happens here.
[133:02.34]That's cheating.
[133:04.04]That's not cheating.
[133:04.71]That's holding your hand in the Choose Your Own Adventure book with your finger in between the pages.
[133:21.29]But that is a beautiful sound.
[133:23.30]Can you hear me?
[133:24.78]We are a go for broadcast.
[133:26.48]Yeah, he's gonna start saying all kinds of fucked up stuff.
[133:28.20]Oh, and I also dispatched Phineas his data.
[133:31.22]Impatient prick.
[133:32.60]Worse, I'm now indebted to him for it.
[133:35.95]Now I'll kindly thank you to get out of my tower.
[133:41.23]It'll make me come back in there.
[133:42.35]There's no need to assert your dominance.
[133:44.49]I doubt I could make you do anything you don't wish to.
[133:47.96]Look, I am well aware that at times I may have the tiniest iota of a prickly exterior, but I must admit I have grown rather fond of you.
[133:58.60]As Nyoka can attest, I do not form attachments with many.
[134:03.06]Do take care.
[134:04.86]why he told us to leave without flinging insults at our persons he really does like you captain well I don't like him boy blasted hell is that I told you no somebody just like somebody just crashed
[134:34.28]What was that?
[134:35.94]Whose ship was that?
[134:38.62]Based on the gunnery attachments, I guess it's one of the board's blockade enforcers, but don't cite me on that.
[134:44.10]Oh, whatever.
[134:45.60]Maybe they'll be alright.
[134:46.92]But I can't see how it affects me.
[134:48.84]I agree.
[134:49.58]Hiram, can you hear me?
[134:52.85]Did you see that?
[134:54.77]Architect saved me from swimmers and fools.
[134:56.75]Sanjar, what are you bloody doing on my channel?
[134:59.89]They're, like, invading each other's channels.
[135:06.01]Yes, but... Hiram.
[135:08.11]Hiram, are you there?
[135:15.44]10% over here.
[135:15.80]10% over here.
[135:16.34]10% over here.
[135:16.62]Everybody gets some time on the radio.
[135:19.06]You can't hog the game.
[135:21.32]Oh, it's a reunion.
[135:22.52]Without a physical contact waiver.
[135:25.26]Ah, the good captain.
[135:26.80]The truth brings us together once more.
[135:29.18]Our salvation has come crashing through the stratosphere.
[135:32.69]We need only collect its weapons.
[135:34.85]Are you mad?
[135:35.95]That's a udl gunship.
[135:37.57]You'd probably shoot your own toes off Uh You're acting like children par for the course really you should do like I did get out while you still retain a shred of sanity We could use the gunship's armaments to defend stellar bay, but we need its targeting module Imagine turning on the radio and hearing this so close to breaking free of this planet and spreading to the stars
[136:03.65]Private channel, guys.
[136:04.61]Can I say something over the internet broadcast?
[136:07.39]I did it.
[136:07.97]I did it!
[136:32.74]See where the ship lo- I don't care.
[136:47.17]Hi.
[136:47.47]I want to talk to Phineas.
[137:02.51]We've arrived at Phineas's orbital lab.
[137:06.05]It's the first time I've been here, too.
[137:07.01]This is a new area, new content.
[137:09.45]Alright, let's go back to the original dentist crew.
[137:27.28]Hello?
[137:28.44]Can you hear me?
[137:29.26]Does this work?
[137:32.44]Get off the radio!
[137:34.08]You're on the same wavelength!
[137:34.94]I have now.
[137:54.59]Shrink ray.
[137:55.81]Science weapons are unique weapons that have strange and powerful effects.
[137:58.29]Science weapon damage and the strength of their effects both increases your science skill increases.
[138:02.74]Aha!
[138:03.66]I see you've found my portable molecular compression device, better known as a shrink ray.
[138:10.18]It's shrink ray?
[138:12.00]Your target will shrink down into a manageable size, whereupon you may commence beating them to a pulp.
[138:19.63]Feel free to try it on a marauder sometime.
[138:22.84]Do they get a funny voice?
[138:23.87]That's all I care about.
[138:24.67]Max, you know what to do.
[138:30.29]Never mind.
[138:30.63]Okay.
[138:44.11]According to Hiram's message, Minister Clark has ordered a suspicious amount of dimethyl sulfoxide.
[138:50.86]It's almost as if he's hoarding the colony's remaining supply.
[138:55.76]Typical elitist, hoarding supplies during a time of scarcity.
[139:00.70]Once I have those chemicals, we can revive the Hope's colonists and put some decent people in charge.
[139:08.75]Let's get along.
[139:09.59]Seriously.
[139:09.89]Okay.
[139:10.07]What's so important about these chemicals?
[139:12.61]Okay.
[139:43.53]Bring me enough chemicals.
[139:45.05]I might not be able to save the Hope's colonists.
[139:47.61]And then nothing will stop the board from destroying this colony.
[139:52.73]Alright, so what's the plan?
[139:55.18]Ah, yes, the details.
[139:56.56]There you go.
[139:57.04]I'm not about to ask you to rampage through Byzantium trading bullets with the board's agents.
[140:01.92]We'll have to resort to subterfuge.
[140:05.38]Carmen Imagawa, she's my contact in Byzantium.
[140:08.53]Meet her as a doctor.
[140:09.35]Byzantium.
[140:09.95]She'll have all the necessary intelligence you require.
[140:14.36]I'm giving you my old nav key to byzantium you'll need it to land thankfully I don't have to drop ten thousand dollars to get it remember you're looking for dimethyl sulfoxide big green bubbling vessel with a warning label I'll take as much as you can find find carmen imagawa steel chemicals got it you're lucky you're behind the glass
[140:56.62]Tested if it's bulletproof.
[140:58.98]I know it's bulletproof.
[141:02.44]Turn the shrink ray on yourself.
[141:04.65]You can't do that.
[141:10.33]I will try it, though.
[141:12.05]I mean, it's like a funny laugh-out-loud weapon, right?
[141:23.00]How many... What does it use for?
[141:23.76]1,300 ammo!
[141:29.31]What happened?
[141:29.68]What is going on?
[141:30.10]Stop!
[141:30.90]Stop it!
[142:01.71]We are now in orbit above Byzantium, Captain.
[142:06.33]I understand we have decided to continue supporting the outlaw scientist, Dr. Phineas Wells.
[142:13.44]No, I don't... I'm about to walk by a companion quest.
[142:17.42]No, I don't... Fine.
[142:19.78]Since we're in Byzantium, there's something I've been meaning to do.
[142:24.48]No, we're not doing it.
[142:27.28]Anything else?
[142:36.92]You know, I'm in a bad mood today.
[142:39.62]You got in my way and you're trying to talk to me.
[142:41.88]I think we should part ways.
[142:43.66]Let's go.
[142:48.56]Never mind.
[142:53.14]Dentists?
[143:01.84]This is further than I got in the game.
[143:03.36]Good night.
[143:03.82]Well, see you later.
[143:05.13]Hope you have fun with the rest of the game.
[143:09.03]Massive spoiler coming up.
[143:13.71]This is the part of the game when Phineas actually rips off a rubber mask.
[143:18.03]And he's the bad guy the whole time.
[143:21.50]Hey, Carmen!
[143:23.06]I'm sorry, we're gonna have to part ways.
[143:29.64]uh what a coincidence me too oh oh you mean I'm supposed to be meeting you alright let's keep this moving yeah you're looking to make contact with minister magpie right yes it won't be easy he spends most of his time in this estate which is heavily guarded
[143:49.96]Mm-hmm.
[143:50.78]So?
[143:52.30]Has there got to be a way to catch the minister someplace less protected?
[143:54.78]Can you get me into the minister's estate?
[143:56.80]How exactly did you get involved in all this?
[143:58.40]There's got to be a way to catch him somewhere.
[143:59.94]Huh.
[144:00.10]Can you get me in there?
[144:01.42]Booger Eater?
[144:22.54]Okay, so they get drunk.
[144:23.16]A booger and eating specialist.
[144:24.44]Thanks for the tip.
[144:26.24]Okay.
[144:53.56]Is it just me or does everything feel big out here?
[144:57.61]You don't feel that?
[145:09.08]I didn't even do anything.
[145:09.94]I just made you small for a second.
[145:11.80]I mean that would have probably hurt a lot.
[145:13.63]It would have like crushed all your bones.
[145:26.53]Why does it not last that long?
[145:35.22]How much can you shrink them?
[145:36.60]What's this?
[145:56.33]Look for contact Cuckoo.
[145:59.37]Don't mention Phineas by name.
[146:01.19]Tell Cuckoo Minister Clark is at his estate under heavy guard that there's something else you're supposed to tell Cuckoo.
[146:11.85]Oh, well, you'll remember it when you talk.
[146:13.46]You've got this golden eagle.
[146:22.70]Will you call me Cuckoo?
[146:28.64]I miss her.
[146:41.44]Look, I had to test the shrink ray.
[146:55.05]At least one NPC was killed.
[146:58.40]That was unintentional, though.
[146:59.54]That was... I wanted to test the shrink ray.
[147:01.08]I didn't know it was going to make people hostile and run away.
[147:03.06]Alright, let's go to the... Let's go to the Minister's Guard.
[147:18.18]You think I'm cuckoo?
[147:20.66]I could spend hours reflecting on the secret working... So, tell me...
[147:28.82]Not your cuckoo.
[147:29.66]That was a long elevator ride.
[147:34.96]I got content for you!
[147:57.15]I can't jump over.
[147:57.77]I was just gonna jump over.
[147:58.91]Okay.
[148:01.91]Oh, hello.
[148:07.03]Get away from me!
[148:07.41]Get away from me!
[148:07.87]Get away from me!
[148:08.97]Yeah!
[148:20.74]I like where this is going.
[148:21.80]Alright.
[148:22.42]You got an agent?
[148:22.98]Is that a representation?
[148:24.06]Why are you talking like me?
[148:39.28]I'm freelance fresh natural talent I know it when I see it listen you got a real special quality raw energy I see you in pictures kid ah the favored mindless entertainment of the unwashed masses hey thousands of viewers and millions of bits can't be wrong
[149:00.67]What are you offering?
[149:01.59]I get to be in a movie?
[149:02.26]I'll do it.
[149:03.36]He's not talking to you.
[149:05.14]No, no, no.
[149:05.34]I'm the one.
[149:05.58]I'm the one.
[149:05.86]Let's do it.
[149:07.46]Yes.
[149:29.06]Terrific!
[149:29.60]We're holding auditions at the studio.
[149:32.04]Head to Odeon Pictures and take the elevator.
[149:34.70]Yeah.
[149:35.00]We're going all the way to the top, baby!
[149:38.36]Yeah, finally!
[149:39.68]Finally a fun mission!
[149:44.14]Let's go.
[149:44.74]An FPS city.
[149:58.85]Fucking FPS city.
[150:00.09]I'd be a fool.
[150:02.81]I'm afraid I can't come down anymore, my good man.
[150:05.83]I'd have to request a counter-waiver and you know how dreadful the paperwork is.
[150:10.35]Don't I ever, my dear fellow.
[150:12.92]Why, I spent three hours filing a discussion authorization just to commence our little tear-to-tear.
[150:20.72]How we suffer in the name of commerce.
[150:29.24]Oh, I don't know what accent this is, but it's in every single thing that is referencing older, potentially wealthy people.
[150:38.99]What is that accent?
[150:41.55]Oh, my dear boy, this is not English or American.
[150:45.01]It's something strange in between.
[150:46.55]It's as if you took a record and held your finger on it while you try to play it back normally.
[150:59.30]It's the Monopoly Man accent.
[151:02.07]That's a warped... That's a warped record, is what that accent is.
[151:18.49]The mid-Atlantic accent is a cultivated accent of English blending together prestigious American and British English Ways of speaking adopted in the early 20th century by mostly by American aristocrats and actors.
[151:30.74]There's not native vernacular or regional American accent Wait they were doing that on purpose?
[151:43.12]That's a fake accent
[151:48.04]really it was americans larping as british so that was just americans doing a poor bad british accent role playing
[152:16.62]Wow.
[152:17.79]Alright.
[152:18.99]Let's go.
[152:19.45]Time for my audition.
[152:25.03]British people do it too.
[152:25.91]Why do British people pretend to have a British accent?
[152:31.49]What?
[152:31.65]Hold on.
[152:32.03]What?
[152:34.49]Why do...
[152:46.75]Okay.
[152:46.97]Got it.
[152:47.13]You should know I drank a lot of water before coming in here.
[152:49.84]I'm about to piss in a pool.
[152:51.00]What?
[152:51.16]Hold on, wait.
[152:51.60]I have to... Uh, I don't think that's a good idea.
[153:18.14]Now go in there, find your mark, and show us what you got.
[153:21.20]I don't even... What's the... What's my motivation?
[153:23.41]Wait, this is the scene?
[153:27.07]Um... I don't even know... I don't even know what movie I'm in.
[153:32.43]Hold on, I leveled up.
[153:44.01]Hmm... Medical...
[153:49.83]And you know what?
[153:50.29]Let's just dump it all in.
[153:56.20]Tier 3.
[154:00.78]Big damage while under 25% health.
[154:02.56]Headshot kills deal 25% of the damage to enemies within 2.5 meters.
[154:05.64]Damn.
[154:07.22]You can attack after killing an enemy.
[154:09.56]Your next attack after killing is a g- I don't even need to see the other ones.
[154:14.87]Alright, you guys have some levels up to do.
[154:20.56]Should I give him the funny weapon?
[154:24.54]Ability damage.
[154:28.31]Yeah, that ability is just powerful.
[154:30.29]Let's see.
[154:36.71]Damage to auto mechanicals?
[154:39.09]Chance to resist ability cooldown on ability use.
[154:41.51]Ability damage.
[154:44.51]Reload and weapon swap.
[154:45.92]Let's just make you a beast.
[154:51.04]Okay, it's time for me to be an actor.
[155:01.75]I'm supposed to be natural.
[155:02.85]Okay, I'm gonna just act natural.
[155:08.19]You call these crates?
[155:09.63]We need at least twice as many, and grungier, as grungy as you can get.
[155:12.89]This is supposed to be an authentic space adventure, and real space adventurers have crates.
[155:17.73]The next time I see the set, there better be loads and loads of fucking crates, or you are fucking fired.
[155:23.40]Alright, um...
[155:42.29]I'm here for my audition.
[155:58.02]I'm just gonna take everything off the set and leave.
[156:09.33]Alright, I think I'm ready.
[156:11.79]Ready?
[156:15.23]Well, well.
[156:16.55]Here to stop us at last, Captain Steel?
[156:19.35]You're too late.
[156:21.85]All of this settlement C&P hungry time food pills, same nutritional value but now with added filler, are ours.
[156:29.89]With their patented stomach stuffing effects and baseline vitamin content, we will be nigh unstoppable.
[156:38.29]Joke's on, you idiot.
[156:39.21]Those crates are just decoys.
[156:41.16]You foul pirate.
[156:42.10]I won't let you get away with this.
[156:44.14]Whatever, as long as you stop monologuing.
[156:46.70]How did C&P manage to fit more in something so tiny?
[156:50.04]They're geniuses.
[156:51.82]Joke's on, you idiot.
[156:52.98]Those crates are just decoys.
[156:54.76]They... they are?
[156:57.24]What an unexpected twist.
[156:59.68]You may have fooled me for now, but not for long.
[157:03.59]Which side is my good side?
[157:05.66]Do you remember the last time we faced each other?
[157:08.53]Out of character, Max.
[157:09.39]Come on.
[157:10.67]Staring one another down across the void of space while flaming debris fell like rain around us.
[157:19.69]The thing you just described are scientifically impossible.
[157:25.62]Hey, I didn't write this.
[157:27.28]Just go with it.
[157:28.87]I had you surrounded and outgunned.
[157:31.23]But you overcame my superior numbers with tactical thinking and a Hammersmith limited edition grenade launcher.
[157:38.25]I've been waiting for five years now and at last my day for vengeance has come.
[157:45.35]You ran like a coward then.
[157:46.81]You'll run now if you know what's good for you.
[157:50.55]Is this where we're dumping backstory?
[157:53.21]Because that should come up earlier.
[157:54.79]Um, when is that day?
[157:56.86]You ran like a coward now.
[157:58.52]You'll run now if you know what's good for you.
[158:01.54]I... Oh.
[158:03.34]I just got chills.
[158:05.64]But still, you'll not stop me now.
[158:09.75]I have this whole port wired with some microenergon transistors.
[158:14.61]Once we're away, I'll activate the gamma particulate field, and the quantaponic chain reaction will turn this whole place into vaporized plasma.
[158:25.48]Most of those words are made up, and the ones that are real don't work like that.
[158:30.78]This script is awful.
[158:32.04]And I spent three hours learning how to pronounce them.
[158:35.56]Terrible writing.
[158:36.68]I hope you've paid your burial fees and signed your personal death and dismemberment waivers, because this is the end for you.
[158:42.76]Oh, be careful.
[158:43.52]Well, finally.
[158:44.32]A hundred intimidated.
[158:46.49]No, it's the end of you.
[158:49.91]Let's see you try.
[158:50.97]I... Line.
[158:53.57]Never mind, I think that's C. To the break room, everyone.
[158:58.78]I need my Moab busy tea.
[159:16.13]No, that's my guy!
[159:17.47]Turn those cameras off!
[159:18.77]Oh, hey!
[159:18.93]Look at me, in front of the green screen!
[159:46.60]What do I do?
[159:47.14]Why is this... Wait, why is that person so... What happened?
[159:59.83]Wait, did I ruin the quest?
[160:15.31]Oh.
[160:27.93]How long ago was this?
[160:36.94]Choose attack in dialogue.
[160:47.94]There it is.
[160:52.20]Alright.
[160:52.70]Rewind.
[160:53.24]Reset.
[160:53.82]Back to one.
[160:54.92]Everyone back to places.
[160:58.91]What?
[160:59.15]Why is he talking for me?
[161:02.09]Uh, it's science.
[161:03.03]Yeah.
[161:03.29]Uh, excuse me.
[161:04.73]You run like a coward.
[161:06.03]Uh, excuse me.
[161:06.59]Most of the things you said are made up.
[161:09.09]I'm smart.
[161:28.53]Let's see you try Oh He was behind the door There's my star walk and talk with me I
[161:57.62]Are we gonna walk?
[161:58.62]That was brilliant stuff.

[162:02.02]Mm-hmm.
[162:03.56]You bet.
[162:04.56]Amazing.
[162:05.38]Just firm up that jawline and you'll be a triple threat.
[162:09.43]I'm gonna have to fire the writing staff.
[162:11.55]What do those anemic fuckwits know about dialogue, anyway?
[162:15.51]I'm thinking a whole new script.
[162:18.39]More pirates, bigger explosions.
[162:20.83]You flicking a stogie slim into a barrel of gasoline.
[162:24.43]Marketing says that kind of action sells tickets.
[162:27.81]How much?
[162:28.05]17,000 XP.
[162:28.23]And... Reputation with the board.
[162:29.29]And... 1100 bucks.
[162:30.03]Low budget.

[166:18.36]Do you have a key card?
[166:24.04]Hey, hey, hey, stand back.
[166:28.23]You, I'm part of Minister Clark's personal detail, and that means you gotta keep five feet back the whole time.
[166:41.90]Relax, I'm just looking for the bathroom.
[166:43.73]Alright, so... Why would you tell me that?
[166:46.19]Um... Alright, I'll leave you to it.

[167:11.28]Is this the bathroom?
[167:15.15]Where's the bathroom?
[167:17.81]I have to talk to him?
[167:27.26]I thought he said he was gonna go to the bathroom so I could steal his key.
[167:30.80]He's gonna leave the key on the fucking table.
[167:34.27]He's basically the most important person in the colony, which makes me the most important guard in the colony.
[167:43.75]Yeah.
[167:44.95]That means I got a key to the minister's estate, my own personal UDL-issued shotgun.
[167:53.63]They don't give those out to just anyone.
[167:56.91]You're very important.
[167:57.97]Congratulations.
[167:59.23]Yep.
[168:00.17]I've nearly made it to the top, my friend.

[168:55.16]A Spectrum Vodka for you.
[168:57.50]You know, when we both are talking really, really low, gravelly voices.
[169:01.75]How about a Spectrum Vodka for your promotion?

[169:06.41]Sounds pretty good to me.

[170:18.72]Is that one supposed to taste like purple berry crunch?
[170:26.40]Or am I just tasting breakfast?
[170:28.68]Preparing bodily waste.
[170:31.08]Collection receptacle.
[170:32.64]I don't feel so good.

[170:49.90]Where you going?
[170:54.24]Is he dead?
[170:54.76]Holy shit, he's dead!
[171:10.14]What did he drink?
[171:11.76]What did he just drink?
[171:13.68]Okay, I'm out.
[171:14.56]The gag sound and the instant death.
[171:37.07]Ragdoll.
[171:37.63]Alright, I have access.
[171:39.33]Wait, can I prove this?
[171:40.39]I can just go in.

[171:46.73]Please deposit your entrails into an appropriate waste receptacle.
[172:07.90]Alright, fine.
[172:08.88]Bye.
[172:10.10]I'll go through the minigame.
[172:14.14]Don't I have an ID card?
[172:16.52]How am I supposed to do this?
[172:17.58]Wait, hey.
[172:18.18]Can we talk?
[172:19.93]There's nothing to see here.
[172:21.25]Move along.
[172:22.27]You know, that's just the sort of thing folks say when they're trying to hide something.
[172:27.07]I have no idea what you're talking about, sir.
[172:31.13]I'm here for Minister Clark.
[172:32.15]I am.
[172:32.25]Death.
[172:32.43]Excuse me.
[172:33.49]I'll be right back.
[172:58.13]Move it, trash can.
[172:59.77]Rerouting course now.
[173:06.31]Oh!
[173:07.63]I'm on my legally allotted break.
[173:09.49]Really, I'm supposed to be... After repeatedly falling.
[173:13.13]No, reject.
[173:16.68]Oh, um, what are you doing here?
[173:21.80]What are you doing here?
[173:22.84]Nothing.
[173:23.72]Nothing.
[173:24.46]Why?
[173:25.42]Does it look like I'm up to something?
[173:28.63]Laws, I knew it.
[173:30.71]You got me.
[173:32.01]I'm caught, aren't I?
[173:33.28]Okay, whatever's going on.
[173:36.66]Yeah, you're in big trouble.
[173:38.34]You're in a lot of trouble.
[173:39.82]I work in the lab at the Ministry of Accuracy and Morale.
[173:42.76]Some of my sprats went missing, but it's not my fault, okay?
[173:46.74]Maybe I let them out more often than regulations allow, but they need to stretch their little legs.
[173:52.42]And so what if I occasionally forgot to latch their cage?
[173:55.28]Everyone gets a little distracted now and then.
[174:00.17]You're not helping your case here.
[174:01.01]Oh, boy.
[174:01.15]That's not good.
[174:01.73]Good luck.
[174:02.23]They're gonna fry you.
[174:31.69]I have a package.
[174:32.27]Block him.
[174:35.61]Don't let him turn around.
[174:41.68]Block him.
[174:42.10]Stay there.
[174:59.98]I'm afraid I can't help you at the moment.
[175:01.46]Have a prosperous day.
[175:25.75]Due to the removal of the suggestion box, all customers with complaints are to be directed to Windows C, as our policy for customer complaints is not to deal with them.
[175:33.35]Windows C will remain unmanned.
[175:35.94]Funny.
[175:39.82]Oh.
[175:40.12]You have a complaint?
[175:53.67]What seems to be the problem?
[175:56.62]Do you need help?
[176:01.74]What do you need?
[176:09.67]I want to get that, but I can't.
[176:10.93]It's stealing.
[176:12.87]Where'd the guard go?
[176:13.55]Uh, hey.
[176:17.91]Where do I get anything to open that door?
[176:29.01]How do I get in there?
[176:29.75]I need to talk to somebody.
[176:30.97]Maybe I should go in the front?
[176:40.33]I need 55 lockpick.
[176:44.14]Do I have any lockpicking skills?
[176:47.30]Wait, I can do this.
[176:48.68]I'm going to drink something.
[176:51.82]Where's my coffee?
[176:55.40]Where's my caffeine inhaler?
[176:59.40]Vodka.
[177:01.95]Right here?
[177:02.81]No.
[177:03.13]Right here?
[177:03.75]No.
[177:08.03]Where is it?
[177:08.39]Right here?
[177:10.55]Cool down.
[177:12.51]Punch.
[177:15.23]I don't even know what the hell this thing is called.
[177:17.92]Fizzy soda?
[177:19.42]Caffeine.
[177:19.88]Alright, here we go.
[177:20.42]Mind attributes.
[177:22.66]Alright, drink an energy drink.
[177:23.68]That's not enough.
[177:27.04]Can I- There's a stack-
[177:41.02]Where's the lockpicking?
[177:41.82]I know I have one.
[177:47.60]There it is.
[177:50.66]Shit.
[177:50.94]Okay, hold on.
[177:53.18]Lockpicking suit.
[177:55.16]That's lockpicking five.
[177:59.52]Where's lockpicking anything else?
[178:09.18]Is it technically a stealth skill?
[178:11.77]Oh, it is.
[178:12.25]Alright.
[178:13.81]Tech skills.
[178:14.65]Tech skills.
[178:15.23]Stealth skills.
[178:15.97]Where was it?
[178:16.81]Dialogue.
[178:17.73]Sneak.
[178:19.09]Long guns.
[178:20.45]Two-handed melee.
[178:21.69]Tech skills.
[178:22.60]Tech skills.
[178:25.62]Stealth skills.
[178:33.38]No, I didn't want to just do drugs again.
[178:42.63]Don't... Okay, now I can put my clothes back on.
[178:45.97]I didn't open this door.
[178:46.55]What was I wearing?
[178:50.88]Oh, the MSI GTX 280, whatever it was.
[179:13.70]I wish I could just go knock him out.
[179:15.87]Oh, fuck.
[179:21.43]Is he going to be mad that I'm in here?
[179:24.19]Can I just be in here now?
[179:27.17]Give me the eraser and the chocolate.
[179:31.84]Okay.
[179:32.50]Okay, where is the package?
[179:35.12]Got it.
[179:39.80]Pocket watch.
[179:50.66]Any other stuff I can just take?
[179:53.02]Shit.
[179:54.50]I don't care.
[179:55.12]Wait, I can go up here.
[179:59.57]What's the point of being up here?
[180:01.61]That's the point, right there.
[180:11.23]Let's move.
[180:11.47]See you later.
[180:24.24]Mail fraud is a felony.
[180:26.62]I'm not committing mail fraud.
[180:29.76]I'm delivering a package to somebody.
[180:32.73]I'm not opening their mail.
[180:33.85]I'm stealing their mail from the mailman to deliver their mail to them.
[180:38.19]Hello, fellow.
[180:39.13]Oh, I forgot.
[180:39.59]I don't like that guy.
[180:43.95]I'm taking the parcel from the postal service and then just bringing it to the person.
[180:50.00]I'm not taking it.
[180:55.05]It's still getting to its intended destination unopened.
[181:03.96]Gotta go across the bridge.
[181:07.22]Alright, now I got it.
[181:11.34]I'm ready to deliver.
[181:12.02]Okay.
[181:25.84]Whatever.
[181:29.22]I'm back.
[181:31.36]I remembered what I had now.
[181:34.66]I got a delivery.
[181:37.96]Got this parcel right here.
[181:39.87]Thanks.
[181:40.09]Kill.
[181:40.21]Kill.
[181:55.38]Okay, Minister Clark.
[182:08.46]Okay, it's a technician.
[182:13.35]Okay, let's go up in his office or wherever he is.
[182:15.09]Alright.
[182:21.39]Um...
[182:24.70]What if a camera pointed at you?
[182:28.69]You!
[182:29.61]You're not one of my guards.
[182:31.73]What are you doing here?
[182:34.23]Minister Clark, what a remarkable honor it is to meet you.
[182:38.55]If this is about another laser wave clip or radio spot, you may kindly fuck off, as the parlance goes.
[182:45.49]I'm not doing any more.
[182:50.62]Ah, cut the crap.
[182:51.78]I'm here for the sulfoxide.
[182:56.83]I don't have any drugs.
[182:59.53]You should try a vending machine or a purveyor of curative goods.
[183:05.33]What is this system coming to when even the Earth Minister is disillusioned beyond hope?
[183:11.14]Will that be all, then?
[183:15.83]Why do you keep talking like that?
[183:17.16]Stars, they're getting denser by the day.
[183:19.64]I shall endeavor to speak more slowly.
[183:25.30]Is this better?
[183:28.67]Slower and louder into my good ear.
[183:32.95]Was that a joke?
[183:34.47]Sarcasm, even?
[183:36.81]Oh, this is such a relief.
[183:38.55]You've no idea how long it's been since I spoke with someone intelligent enough for irony.
[183:45.68]Great, so how about you tell me about those chemicals?
[183:47.62]This again?
[183:48.52]I really don't know about any chemicals.
[183:51.46]Process of elimination.
[183:53.58]The only other person with access?
[183:57.16]Of course, of course.
[183:59.14]It's Rockwell again.
[184:00.50]Who else?
[184:01.70]And I thought he was only holding me here to keep me out of the way.
[184:06.21]What?
[184:06.35]I mean, you're locked up here.
[184:09.55]You are a quick study, indeed.
[184:13.00]I've long suspected Rockwell of transacting business in my name.
[184:16.45]But this proves it.
[184:18.35]He's attempting to game the system.
[184:20.57]But he won't be able to get away with it forever.
[184:23.09]Eventually, Rockwell's house of cards will topple.
[184:27.13]I dearly hope so.
[184:28.67]And you might be part of the equation.
[184:31.07]Okay, I can do one dart.
[184:32.41]Through the window.
[184:35.71]Just... Into his neck.
[184:40.19]And that fucking syringe is full of salicylic acid.
[184:43.67]It'll kill him in less than five minutes.
[184:50.05]Why would he go through all this trouble?
[184:51.17]How should I know?
[184:51.75]I've been under house arrest for years.
[184:54.31]But there is a way to find out.
[184:55.89]And perhaps to set things right.
[184:59.01]Whatever Rockwell's doing, he'll be doing it from the HHC headquarters.
[185:03.70]Your best lead is to look for details in his office.
[185:07.44]captain we must investigate rockwell an injustice like this cannot go unchecked it's filthy indeed my mechanical friend rife with the worst sort of corruption why this is starting to sound like an issue of dissident hunter
[185:36.89]We're discussing industrial espionage, legal redress, the possible salvation of Halcyon.
[185:43.83]Is this not exhilarating?
[185:47.03]Also, this is the longest conversation I've had with someone else in quite some time.
[185:55.04]If you're the best we have to offer, we're screwed.
[185:57.64]I assure you, I didn't ask to be locked up and made to perform like a trained animal.
[186:03.24]But I'm attempting to make the best of an opportunity.
[186:06.60]I only hope you can do the same.
[186:09.06]Now, we've got to get into the HHC.
[186:11.14]That's in the Acropolis District, along with the other major corporate and government facilities.
[186:16.69]But only board employees are allowed into the district because there's a heavily guarded checkpoint just down the street.
[186:22.93]There might be a route through the maintenance tunnels, but I'm afraid I don't know specifics.
[186:28.83]Most people avoid the area for obvious reasons.
[186:35.31]A few guards don't scare me.
[186:36.40]How did you hold on to your access card?
[186:37.64]Government.
[186:37.90]Corporations.
[186:38.26]Corporate government.
[187:04.52]Alright, I should get going.
[187:05.34]Alright, you can count on me!
[187:32.70]Halcyon is in dire need of someone like you.
[187:41.26]Anything in the... There's a bolter pistol.
[187:45.97]The refined Byzantine.
[187:53.49]Entering quiet.
[188:05.50]Alright, what is that?
[188:12.41]Plus five skill.
[188:13.67]Range weapon skills plus five.
[188:23.42]That's pretty good.
[188:25.78]Mine... Never mind.
[188:27.29]I got excited for no reason.
[188:43.54]Alright, let's do it.
[188:50.14]Steel... book.
[188:54.59]Why is there a book in the shape of cheese?
[188:58.55]What's the cheese book?
[189:00.19]What's the cake book?
[189:01.23]What is that?
[189:05.02]That's freaking me out.
[189:06.32]How do you read that book?
[189:11.94]That's a magician's book.
[189:13.26]Yeah, there's like, look at all this weird stuff here.
[189:15.98]Alright, so get access to this person's office and yell at him and scream at him.
[189:36.85]Down there.
[189:37.79]The chairman's office.
[189:47.53]Pizza is the shape of a triangle, so press triangle.
[189:52.33]If it were only that easy.
[190:01.00]Oh, there.
[190:01.72]That one right there.
[190:02.74]Can't you just see the stench of impropriety radiating off of him?
[190:07.26]For the last time, access to Byzantium is impossible without a proper nav key.
[190:13.82]Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to be...
[190:23.23]How much have you ever lost on a coin toss?
[190:27.00]How about?
[190:27.32]I don't understand.
[190:30.34]It's a simple question.
[190:31.94]How much?
[190:34.44]I don't know.
[190:35.12]Maybe... I can't reckon I'd say.
[190:37.75]You can say.
[190:38.83]Hmm.
[190:42.61]Gracefully, might I add.
[190:44.18]What a coincidence, just now I thought I'd really like to sock this lady in the face.
[191:15.25]Ugh, how utterly expected.
[191:18.21]You must be one of those violent vagrants I've heard tell of, wandering the system in search of brutality.
[191:24.25]Honestly, what is the board thinking, letting so many of your ilk into the city proper?
[191:28.29]It's madness.
[191:34.49]If the board isn't supposed to let people into the city, how did you get here?
[191:38.04]I earned my place here, just like everyone else.
[191:41.08]My grandfather was the CIO at Tile, you see.
[191:46.45]CIO?
[191:46.85]Oh, boy.
[191:47.24]So you mean the guy that showed up to work once a month.
[191:50.22]In socks and sandals and a blazer.
[191:51.00]Oh, what did he come up with?
[192:11.14]Hmm...
[192:35.05]Wait, but what did you do?
[192:36.60]I just told you.
[192:37.70]My grandfather made millions of bits as CIO, and I earned them from him.
[192:43.32]So you came into it.
[192:45.20]You married into it.
[192:56.72]Of course it is.
[192:57.94]Wealth is the most visible, objective measure of success.
[193:01.38]And success isn't given to you.
[193:03.25]It's earned.
[193:04.27]My grandfather taught me that.
[193:06.65]If you have wealth, you're successful.
[193:08.27]And if you're successful, you must have earned it.
[193:10.67]What time do you close?
[193:11.23]Honestly, it's a simple concept.
[193:12.99]No, what time?
[193:13.81]What time do you close?
[193:17.57]I... Dark and dark.
[193:19.46]That's not the time.
[193:20.06]What time do you close?
[193:23.58]I...
[193:26.62]You're welcome.
[193:28.04]Now, do we have any further business, or are you just here for the repartee?
[193:35.07]What's wrong with you?
[193:36.99]It erodes the very pillars of our society.
[193:39.65]Merit, decorum, personal hygiene.
[193:43.52]This city is meant for us, the system's finest.
[193:46.48]We earned its luxuries.
[193:48.86]But now we are overrun with the unworthy and the ungrateful, and this early retirement nonsense is making it even worse.
[193:55.97]Mm-hmm.
[193:57.71]That's a terrible attitude, you shouldn't look down on people like that.
[194:02.33]Early retirement, what are you talking about?
[194:03.69]The worst thing to happen to Halcyon.
[194:05.99]A contest that gives even the lowliest to most inefficient workers a chance to live in Byzantium.
[194:12.20]By simply winning a lottery, those early retirees get an exclusive district of Byzantium to themselves.
[194:18.48]No one else is even allowed to go there.
[194:21.56]Tell me, how is that fair?
[194:27.55]Life's not fair.
[194:28.57]You want to hire me?
[194:29.27]Hmm.
[194:29.35]Hmm.
[194:51.78]Yes.
[194:52.62]Listen to your... your... Friend.
[194:56.30]What is that person?
[194:57.34]Doesn't seem like you have very many.
[194:59.04]Are they your secretary?
[195:00.38]Personal masseuse?
[195:01.54]Or do you just keep them around as a mobile armrest?
[195:05.27]Well, it doesn't matter.
[195:06.53]What's important is that you think this is a fabulous arrangement, and you'd be thrilled to lend me your services.
[195:12.65]Aren't you?
[195:16.80]Why would I ever help you with something like this?
[195:18.44]Did you miss the part where I said I'd pay you?
[195:20.49]That's all the reasons someone like you should require.
[195:22.69]I mean... It's not.
[195:27.11]I like money, but give me something better than that.
[195:30.03]Better than money?
[195:31.55]Let's see.
[195:32.23]There's... No.
[195:34.73]The thrill of discovery.
[195:36.54]Like in an Aetherwave adventure.
[195:38.18]People love those, right?
[195:40.00]Don't you want to see what the retirement district is like?
[195:47.34]Fine, I'll do it.
[195:49.12]But not for the money.
[195:52.32]Fantastic.
[195:53.28]Consider yourself employed, Vagrant.
[195:55.73]I hear the chosen retirees all enter the retirement district via the port landing pad, but it's completely locked down.
[196:02.15]You'd never get in that way.
[196:04.07]Unless, of course, you had a wealthy, beautiful benefactor of impeccable social pedigree, which you do.
[196:10.00]I'm not going to let her have that over me, guys.
[196:11.48]That's her power.
[196:12.04]That's where her power comes from.
[196:23.31]How'd you get these access codes?
[196:24.27]You're being paid with exposure.
[196:25.29]Social capital!
[196:25.99]That actually is paying with exposure.
[196:28.17]Alright, I'm done with you.
[196:59.14]Max.
[197:00.08]Have you said anything about this?
[197:20.91]Just checking.
[197:36.41]Use the password to access the terminal.
[197:38.41]Let's try it.
[197:39.07]We're already right here, though.
[197:40.05]Oh, it's down there, terminal.
[197:47.45]We're already right here.
[197:48.91]Let's do this first.
[197:55.01]The Acropolis district is off limits.
[197:57.43]Move along.
[197:59.47]Mind if I take a breather?
[198:00.45]I'm pretty tired after hauling around all these bits.
[198:03.35]What in the law's name are you on about?
[198:06.85]Uh, these 2783 bits have been weighing me down all day.
[198:11.39]Ow, my back is killing me.
[198:14.96]This is killing me.
[198:18.78]Thank you.
[198:37.84]I can go wherever I want.
[198:40.16]I can even go in the trash and eat out of the trash.
[198:46.30]Cool.
[198:46.61]There's a lot of people in here.
[199:05.75]Whoa, he's up there.
[199:11.79]Hi, I have an appointment.
[199:12.73]Welcome to the official headquarters of the Halcyon Holdings Corporation Board.

[199:23.54]Do I have to go through the scanner?
[199:29.34]I clearly have a bunch of weapons.
[199:36.44]Nothing exciting ever happens around here.
[199:42.65]Ah, well.
[199:44.63]Is this official enough for you?
[199:46.61]I'm not doing that.
[199:47.65]That's ridiculous.
[200:11.39]it's procedure not doing it now let's see damn it when did I run out of forms what a shame you don't have to be sarcastic about it look you don't have time to wait on new forms and I can't afford the citations for impeding hac business
[200:33.79]So I'm going to save us both some trouble and waive your forms.
[200:36.03]Okay, thank you.
[200:37.43]Just know there are a bunch of guards upstairs, and they're all high on dervish mist and low on patience.
[200:43.19]So try anything funny, and they'll paint the walls with their guts.
[200:46.44]So they're all high.
[200:49.80]Thanks for the info.
[200:51.38]Now I know that they're all high.
[200:56.18]I'm not.
[201:06.43]Hi, cool dude to let you in with guns.
[201:09.11]I don't have any guns.
[201:10.88]Look.
[201:13.76]Do you see any guns on you?
[201:15.00]No.
[201:15.62]Do you have any guns?
[201:17.00]No, this is toothpaste.
[201:18.08]I don't have any guns.

[201:39.26]Personal assistant to Adjutant Akande and Chairman Rockwell.
[201:43.32]I'm also responsible for organizing the Adjutant's stationery, which is more of a hobby.
[201:51.21]I want to meet Chairman Rockwell.
[201:54.01]Oh, you were being serious.
[201:56.87]I'm obliged to inform you that Chairman Rockwell is unavailable for an indeterminate duration.
[202:03.11]Will there be anything else?
[202:06.60]Okay, fine.
[202:08.45]It's gonna be like that?
[202:09.19]Alright.
[202:20.50]Fuck your Halo sword.
[202:25.28]We're outta here.
[202:29.68]And speaking of Halo, Halo Reach releases on December 3rd.
[202:34.67]So you'll be catching this streamer.
[202:36.24]Play that when it releases.
[202:38.92]Ow, my fucking head.
[202:40.50]Ow.
[202:42.04]That just blacked out for like 20 seconds.
[202:44.98]That was weird.
[202:48.35]Okay.
[202:51.11]Can I get in here?
[202:52.11]Will they see me do this?
[202:53.01]I mean, the game just saved itself.
[202:56.18]Why?
[203:08.23]Oh!
[203:11.45]You guys didn't come in quick enough.
[203:13.11]What?
[203:14.17]He's running in here.
[203:18.29]Huh?
[203:21.13]You should go back to your desk.
[203:22.29]I saw somebody eyeing your stationery.
[203:24.19]I know.
[203:24.67]I love those fingerprints.
[203:27.31]Yeah.
[203:44.52]Sucker.
[203:55.89]Disorder detected.
[203:57.59]Minimum.
[203:58.65]Oh.
[204:02.07]Broken snow globe?
[204:06.49]Ooh, what a view.
[204:08.42]Where are they?
[204:13.21]hack a hundred damn it view priority message halcyon is on the brink of starvation the board scientists are working on a solution workers can look forward to the lifetime employment program don't worry I'll make it I'll make sure it gets properly edited you'll see the current version when you print your key card I'll take a ministry key card thank you what
[204:38.84]Good afternoon.
[204:40.28]I'm Chairman Rockwell, and I'm here to address a serious issue facing us.
[204:45.06]As you all know, our colony has been successful beyond our wildest dreams.
[204:49.78]Unfortunately, we've recently discovered that our food supply will not be able to sustain Halcyon's population in the long term.
[204:57.23]Everyone will die.
[204:59.69]Everyone will slowly stop living from malnutrition.
[205:03.99]But we're doing it together, and that's what
[205:09.04]doesn't give you something to read that will placate the masses soon, all of you will find yourselves violently unemployed.
[205:18.12]But I can assure you there's nothing to fear.
[205:21.40]We've got a solution.
[205:23.08]It's called the Lifetime Employment Program.
[205:26.47]We will freeze most of the colony to preserve resources.
[205:29.67]It's called bringing back Overwatch.
[205:31.71]Same actor.
[205:35.02]Look, you idiots.
[205:36.48]How many times do I have to tell you we can't say shit like that?
[205:39.80]Fire whoever wrote this.
[205:42.56]While Halcyon's brightest minds solve the problem of our nutritional shortage, the rest of the colony will be placed in suspended animation.
[205:50.85]Individuals will be revived on a rotating basis, so that every Halcyonite can be part of the important work of saving our colony.
[205:58.57]Sorry, couldn't resist.
[206:00.53]Let's go again.
[206:06.17]And someday, in the not too distant future when we've solved this crisis, we'll all be back together again working for the good of Halcyon.
[206:15.04]Until then, the board shall provide for the deserving just as it always has.
[206:20.08]So, obey your supervisors, take your vitamins, follow your corporate mandated grooming rituals, and rest assured with the board on your side, there is nothing to worry about.
[206:36.98]whatever that was some quite distressing information I know I think you should be in charge I was hoping for a word let's make you the CEO anyone with eyes to see would not be shocked to hear that the colony is dying but the board's solution on the other hand choosing to save themselves and their families and friends at the expense of the rest of the colony those fucking bastards what are we going to do about this
[207:05.90]We'll have to dig more into the issue.
[207:07.16]I fail to see how it's our problem.
[207:08.42]I don't know, but someone's going to die.
[207:09.90]I don't know.
[207:11.62]You're CEO.
[207:12.40]Uh... CEO.
[207:13.12]You.
[207:13.26]Alright, I got the info.

[208:07.03]Let's fuck the whole thing up.
[208:11.41]Message armor.
[208:11.85]Please allow between three and nine months for your message to complete transit.
[208:22.50]Chairman, I've made inquiries.
[208:23.94]It can confirm that we have plenty of food stored away from our inter-colony trade.

[211:13.93]That's very restricted.
[211:16.79]I need a ID card.
[211:19.91]Not so fast.
[211:21.45]The Ministry of Accuracy and Morale is off-limits to everyone without X-36 level clearance.
[211:26.96]Basically, if you don't work here, or for Chairman Rockwell himself, you're not getting in.
[211:33.46]uh how's this for clearance I got the key card I don't know how you got that but I still don't know you and I don't have any new clearances on the list let me through right now or your official record won't be fit for polishing floors what waste my time and I'll bury you so deep in citations you'll die of paper cuts before you ever crawl out and people like me never repeat themselves oh no you must be from chairman rockwell's office

[213:04.47]Why am I not allowed in here?
[213:07.70]What?
[213:08.28]Restricted area.

[213:10.99]This is great.
[213:11.37]Now get to work.
[213:35.36]Actually, I feel at home here.
[213:36.38]And it's nice to look at green.
[213:38.72]Green.
[213:41.44]Now, let's see the dental work going on in here.
[213:43.44]Let the record show that subject 23K's cause of death is cerebral vascular incident brought about by a ruptured aneurysm.
[213:50.79]He's got to be the other way.
[213:53.69]You got him in the wrong.
[213:57.29]And I had such high hopes for this one.
[213:59.87]Oh, well.
[214:00.97]I suppose it could have been worse.
[214:03.21]Yeah.
[214:04.24]They could have ended up like those poor bastards in containment.
[214:15.44]Cool.
[214:16.66]Alright, bye.
[214:19.18]Central lab.
[214:19.84]Alright, let's go get the chemical.
[214:29.58]Bring him!
[214:36.09]I was gonna make a fluoride reference like they were in fluoride.
[214:44.88]It was too late.
[214:46.72]Alright, so I'm not allowed in there.
[215:08.36]No, no, no, no, no.
[215:13.20]Alright, I have to sneak around.
[215:18.65]Nice kill.
[215:24.33]Alright.
[215:27.84]I'm not allowed in this area, I know.
[215:29.36]I have to be sneaky.
[215:36.04]Somebody right here.
[215:42.93]Central lab.
[215:44.61]Save it right here.
[215:53.80]Oh, shit.
[215:58.12]Something is not right.
[215:59.50]We've got trouble.
[216:00.59]What?
[216:33.51]Really?
[216:36.58]What's wrong with your gun?
[216:40.44]Nice commentary.
[216:41.22]I got nothing to comment on.
[216:42.40]I need to wait till you go... Where?
[216:53.65]Maybe just wrap around?
[216:54.55]Let me try going this way.
[216:59.59]Anybody in here?
[217:03.99]Alright, I don't think there's anybody in here.
[217:10.09]Okay, there's a workbench over here, but who cares.
[217:12.45]Alright, there's that guy.
[217:18.47]Keep going all the way around.
[217:21.63]Okay.
[217:33.64]I paid $3,000 to be allowed in here.
[217:36.10]This is bullshit.
[217:38.88]Come on.
[217:52.27]Don't turn.
[217:52.65]Don't turn.
[217:53.05]Don't turn.
[217:53.51]Don't turn.
[217:54.03]Don't turn.
[217:54.61]Don't turn.
[217:55.32]Don't turn.
[217:56.86]Stay there.
[217:57.26]Stay there.
[217:57.88]Yeah.
[217:58.40]Yeah.
[218:00.29]Alright, where's the other one?
[218:02.11]Right here?
[218:03.75]Which way are you going?
[218:12.36]What the hell is this?
[218:32.89]Where's this soul?
[218:34.79]Where is it?
[218:42.09]Oh, shit.
[218:42.90]Gotta go up and around.
[218:46.26]Is it somebody right here?
[218:56.20]No?
[218:58.50]Alright.
[218:59.18]Slow down, slow down.
[219:07.53]What was that noise?
[219:09.58]Stop.
[219:10.32]Wow.
[219:11.72]You are loud.
[219:24.09]Fuck off.
[219:24.83]I have to drink a bunch of drugs.
[219:27.83]Put on my suit and everything.
[219:29.39]Alright, where's this lie suit?
[219:41.14]Where is it?
[219:41.88]Stealth skills.
[219:43.18]Block pick 5.
[219:44.88]That puts me at 50.
[219:46.08]And I'll drink a bottle of... What is this down here?
[219:52.83]Caffeine gel.
[219:53.69]It has rubbed caffeine gel all over me.
[220:00.44]Mind attributes.
[220:01.32]Drink it.
[220:02.16]Okay.
[220:02.66]Open the door.
[220:15.89]Any guards?
[220:18.11]No.
[220:22.37]Alright, I'm gonna get it.
[220:30.21]Warning.
[220:31.99]Discontinued due to severe adverse reactions.
[220:44.80]Transfer to canister.
[220:49.48]This procedure may result in the invalidation of experiment results and the death of human test subjects.
[220:55.60]Sudden withdrawal from sulfoxide is highly lethal and will result in the cancellation of any in-progress experiments.
[221:03.56]Oh.
[221:06.32]Transfer 26%.
[221:06.64]Wait, who?
[221:53.84]Somebody talk me up a little bit here.
[221:55.36]Somebody talk me up.
[221:56.00]I did something bad.
[221:56.72]Talk me up a little.
[221:57.58]Anything?
[222:01.15]Uh...
[222:07.85]Oops.
[222:08.57]Okay.
[222:09.13]Um... The colonists.
[222:17.31]Right, right.
[222:17.89]I'm saving millions.
[222:23.28]Uh... Right?
[222:29.72]Let's get this up to... It's already at 50.
[222:35.14]Uh... Let's do handguns.
[222:40.87]Okay, so that's done.
[222:46.83]I got 100% of that stuff.
[222:53.86]I can now go back to Phineas.
[222:58.46]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[222:59.52]I'm going to do the retirement quest.
[223:03.76]Yeah.
[223:03.98]Alright, exit.
[223:09.59]What's the fastest way to get the hell out of here?
[223:11.43]Without being spotted.
[223:24.25]Run fast?
[223:25.01]No, that'll alert everybody.
[223:25.97]I can get out.
[223:36.64]Like this.
[223:45.10]Lazy.
[223:46.44]Lazy!
[224:13.16]Hold on, stay right here.
[224:20.29]Oh, fuck.
[224:24.66]Whoa.
[224:25.20]Huh?
[224:25.78]Huh?
[224:37.90]Idiots.
[224:45.17]Right, alright.
[224:46.17]I'm almost out.
[224:47.29]Get out of... Don't shoot.
[224:48.81]Alright, I'm out.
[225:13.58]Good, good, good, good, good.
[225:24.49]See you later.
[225:27.83]Nice to see everybody.
[225:35.69]You did what you had to.
[225:39.13]I will tell myself that over and over again in the shower.
[225:44.47]Let's do the retirement home thing.
[225:55.61]Did you hear?
[225:56.93]Marjorie Dalton and Archibald Harris are redecorating with real crystal faux windows.
[226:04.80]Laws?
[226:06.02]Don't they know those went out of style three weeks ago?
[226:09.92]So did their marriage, apparently.
[226:12.62]I'd wager my inverted bathtub she backs out of the contract first.
[226:15.94]Inverted bathtub?
[226:23.85]Fearless.
[226:29.38]Can you go in the sewers?
[226:40.88]Yeah.
[226:43.83]Down.
[226:44.17]Here we go.
[226:45.01]This way.
[226:47.55]Retirement home.
[226:48.17]Retirement home.
[226:48.75]Retirement home.
[226:52.67]Retirement home.
[226:53.67]Down.
[226:54.45]How do I get there?
[226:59.42]Time at home.
[227:00.42]How do I get down there?
[227:03.02]Need to go down?
[227:04.16]Take the fast way.
[227:04.94]I tried jumping over there already.
[227:06.38]There's definitely a way to go down from here.
[227:08.52]Elevator or something?
[227:32.76]Just fast travel?
[227:35.20]I guess we're going in here.
[227:52.50]Retirees!
[227:54.24]That's the last of them.
[227:56.32]Finally.
[227:57.74]Is it just me, or are we getting more and more retirees lately?
[228:03.74]Access to this area restricted.
[228:05.00]Unseal the door.
[228:06.03]Alright.
[228:15.19]Alright.
[228:15.49]I'm in the retirement center.

[229:45.61]We're all retiring.
[229:48.19]The three of us are retiring together.
[230:06.33]So the audio.
[230:17.15]Don't forget to properly dispose of all courses in a board-regulated space-compacting container.
[230:28.96]Bones.
[230:30.12]Pulse.
[230:30.62]System alert.
[230:31.36]Investigating.
[230:32.24]What?
[230:32.85]Processing data.
[230:33.97]Searching for unheard.
[230:45.17]This is not retiring.
[230:47.77]Well, it is literally, I guess.
[230:53.21]This is not part of the brochure.
[230:54.89]Okay.
[230:54.99]500.
[230:55.65]500.
[230:55.73]Oops, don't die.
[230:58.21]I'll take your confession now!
[231:19.99]I think we may have been deceived.
[231:22.17]Yes.
[231:22.25]They lied to us.
[231:41.76]Chairman Rockwell must go.
[231:53.07]What?
[231:53.91]Robophobia.
[231:55.37]Okay, I'll take it.
[231:58.05]I'm just afraid of everything.
[232:02.43]Range attacks.
[232:03.87]Detection radius plus 20% damage.
[232:08.03]Many of you are affected by a harmful combat effect.
[232:09.95]No, no, no.
[232:17.34]Let's see.
[232:18.26]Headshots deal 25% of their damage to enemies.
[232:20.60]That's kind of cool, I guess.
[232:24.08]When you use the inhaler, any downed companions are revived.
[232:28.12]15 minute cooldown?
[232:28.82]That's too much.
[232:33.58]Your ranged attacks reduce the target's armor rating by 1 point per hit.
[232:38.64]Ooh.
[232:39.84]That's pretty good.
[232:42.26]I'll take it.
[232:42.64]Alright, I've investigated.
[232:50.30]It turns out they're killing everybody down here.
[232:54.71]What the fucking... Absolute twist.
[233:02.80]Uh, disable auto-mechs.
[233:07.20]Disabled.
[233:09.07]Unseal the hatch!
[233:22.73]That robophobia is constantly there because of Max.
[233:26.61]Or Sam.
[233:27.01]Uh-oh.
[233:32.63]I think we're going to have to rip his battery out.
[233:37.32]You did good, Sam.
[233:42.04]Every Sam unit comes lean, mean, and ready to clean.
[233:46.24]Ah!
[233:50.21]This unit is unable to process the service request.
[233:55.80]Customer, please repeat the command.
[234:00.14]Go back to the ship, Sam.
[234:01.60]You're scaring me.
[234:02.42]Alright, what do I need to do?
[234:10.05]Go this way.
[234:10.65]No.
[234:27.99]Rat.
[234:29.25]Watch out for that.
[234:29.83]Watch out for that rat.
[234:30.91]Excuse me.
[234:38.46]Give me aggro.
[234:40.34]I can't believe we... I can't believe we aggroed.
[234:42.56]Holy fuck, I died instantly.
[234:43.86]What was that?
[234:44.72]Is it because of the robot that shot me?
[234:59.07]Oh, I'm still wearing this shit.
[235:01.93]Get me back my MSI stuff.
[235:10.80]Let's move.
[235:17.30]Can I disable all the drones?
[235:30.84]I'm gonna see a lot of sad faces that I just tried to do that.
[235:35.86]Don't worry.
[235:36.34]I didn't.
[235:37.92]Alright, where you at?
[235:39.56]Oh.
[235:58.85]alright this way I think maintenance tunnels prosperity plaza alright hold on let me use the workbench and do some tinkering uh the shotgun would be better handgun handgun do it again
[236:23.98]312 DPS.
[236:24.34]I'm running out of money, though, so easy.
[236:27.72]Nothing really needs to be repaired, I guess.
[236:30.30]What about my shirts?
[236:32.67]Oh, I'm good.
[236:47.32]Rats.
[237:00.33]Alright.
[237:05.15]Now... Hortense?
[237:12.39]Oh, right, right.
[237:13.01]That's the person it turned into.
[237:14.39]I made it.
[237:20.17]Oh, it's this lady!
[237:21.07]Okay, remember, it's the lady.
[237:24.59]I did what you wanted.
[237:25.32]What?
[237:25.58]You're talking to me like that.
[237:26.86]We already had a discussion about this shit.
[237:28.54]The retirement district is a Paradise you should see for yourself.
[237:32.40]It's awesome in there.
[237:54.83]There's pools and spas.
[237:59.59]It's great.
[238:03.41]An endless, extravagant garden.
[238:06.74]There were even signs that said, no frolicking.
[238:09.08]It was just one giant party.
[238:10.24]They had a vodka fountain.
[238:11.90]Everything is gold.
[238:13.22]Everything's made out of gold.
[238:15.51]Yeah, it was really cool.
[238:17.45]Alright, have fun.
[238:44.92]It's a Paradise.
[238:46.06]You're gonna love it.
[238:51.85]See you on the other side.
[238:59.81]Follow?
[239:00.21]I can't.
[239:01.27]That's not in this game.
[239:04.19]That's, uh, that's complaint... Complaint against game.
[239:08.83]You can't follow anybody.
[239:14.17]Alright, now we can go back to Phineas.
[239:26.06]We've got the stuff.
[239:33.15]Jerma, there's a robot following you.
[239:34.93]MonkaS.
[239:37.09]What?
[239:38.03]No way.
[239:41.55]Or rather, you have a message from Adjutant Sophia Akande.
[239:45.77]Who's that?
[239:46.49]No one ever looks quite the same in person as they do in my reports.
[239:51.47]And my reports of you have been exceptionally thorough.
[239:54.91]You've had quite a career.
[239:55.99]Let's skip.
[240:03.58]You have something I want.
[240:05.80]I'd like to negotiate.
[240:12.00]I'm listening.
[240:12.82]Phineas Wells is wanted by the board.
[240:15.73]I want to convince you to turn him in to us.
[240:26.02]Okay.
[240:29.10]What exactly?
[240:29.90]I'm laughing.
[240:32.34]Vandalism.
[240:33.02]Illegal experiment.
[240:34.10]I could go on.
[240:37.26]He was mean to me.
[240:37.92]He yelled at me.
[240:38.76]He called me stupid.
[240:39.90]Okay.
[240:40.98]He stole a bunch of chemicals.
[240:42.24]Cut her off, Ada.
[240:43.02]Thanks.
[240:43.34]Can you believe the nerve on that psychopath?
[240:46.38]You know I can still hear you, right?
[241:08.23]Adjutant Akande's call has been terminated.
[241:10.71]Will there be anything else, Captain?
[241:14.88]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[241:16.72]Trace that call.
[241:18.64]And send a virus to her computer, please.
[241:29.01]We've arrived at Phineas' orbital lab.
[241:33.69]If you don't mind my saying, Captain, Minister Clark is lucky to have you on his side.
[241:42.11]Don't go rogue on me now.
[242:01.30]I'm afraid of Sam.
[242:06.37]Alright, what densest are we bringing?
[242:10.59]I need Sam.
[242:11.77]I don't need Sam!
[242:15.70]Your entire ship is a robot.
[242:27.90]I've got chemicals.
[242:29.36]I've got chemicals.
[242:31.22]Doctor, I've got chemicals.
[242:32.34]I'm bringing them to you.
[242:33.46]I've got them.
[242:34.03]Here they are.
[242:35.53]Install them.
[242:36.33]Breathe them.
[242:37.45]Experiment on them.
[242:39.13]Hey!
[242:39.73]I've kept myself busy in your absence.
[242:42.23]Optimized my formula.
[242:43.85]I'm now confident I can revive the remaining colonists.
[242:46.75]Good.
[242:48.53]All I need now is the dimethyl sulfoxide.
[242:50.47]I'll take as much as you can give me.
[242:54.36]Forget about the chemicals for a second the colonies on the verge of collapse I found your chemicals in the ministry the board was testing them on human subjects I had to let the test subjects die, but I brought back all the chemicals I put them out of their misery Here's your canister of chemicals, by the way These are both awful
[243:24.35]Thank you.
[243:25.35]You've brought me enough chemicals to get started, at least.
[243:28.31]All of them.
[243:28.69]I'm just sorry they came at the cost of human lives.
[243:31.89]Those poor people.
[243:33.57]They must have died in agony.
[243:35.71]What exactly was the board trying to accomplish?
[243:40.57]Something about repeatedly melting frozen people.
[243:43.17]There were a lot of big words.
[243:44.59]You know how food goes stale if you freeze it too much like that, but with people?
[243:49.04]You say the board's trying to freeze their subjects over and over again without inflicting permanent damage?
[243:54.57]DumbScience40.
[244:22.83]Uh the colonies on the verge of collapse the board's been trying to cover it up.
[244:26.11]I know I've suspected as much for years Of course, I don't expect the board to do a thing about it.
[244:31.55]We've been driving our colonies to the brink of destruction for decades What do we do mismanagement put our colony on the road to collapse if we don't put a stop to them thousands of colonists are going to die What do we what do we do?
[244:48.10]It gets worse.
[244:48.62]The chairman's planning on freezing every worker in halcyon
[244:53.93]It's pretty fucked up.
[244:54.75]Yep.
[244:54.85]Yeah.
[244:55.01]I think this calls for... Let's go to Chili's and order everything off the menu.
[244:57.75]Might as well.
[244:58.39]Okay.
[245:24.74]Then I'll stop it.
[245:34.95]We need to think about this.
[245:35.99]There has to be something we can do.
[245:37.15]That's it.
[245:37.53]We just give up all the trouble Winston for nothing.
[245:39.37]This colony's a mess.
[245:40.17]I'll be glad to put it behind me as soon as I get a chance.
[245:42.27]Whoa.
[245:42.37]There's got to be something we can do.
[245:50.27]Do you know what's waiting for us on the Hope?
[245:52.95]Scientists, engineers, artists, the brightest minds Earth ever sent us, uncorrupted by the Board.
[246:01.42]The Board's going to dispose of them all and transform the Hope into a prison for the rest of us.
[246:07.58]They're likely on their way to the Hope as we speak.
[246:09.84]Let's go cut them off.
[246:10.88]We need to get to those colonists before the Board.
[246:13.87]I have enough chemicals to start reviving a few of them, but no easy way to get them off the Hope.
[246:18.76]Into you.
[246:20.52]Would have been a lot easier if you just set up your lab next to the hope.
[246:25.02]Merciful gibbering law, you're a genius!
[246:28.36]Yeah.
[246:29.20]We bring the hope to us.
[246:31.07]Skip the entire ship across the distance of colony space.
[246:35.25]Right next to my lab.
[246:36.57]I like it.
[246:41.37]Just wait until you hear the details.
[246:43.57]I haven't been this energized since the time I injected myself with raw caponoid.
[246:49.32]If we link up the hope to the unreliable then use your navigational computer to calculate a reasonably safe vector we can skip the entire colony ship into the rings of-
[246:58.32]Skip the entire third act of the game and get to the ending.
[247:19.28]Experimental methods for killing not just life forms are not covered under this unit's limited liability agreement.
[247:28.00]Well said whatever you are.
[247:30.00]Hey, it's Sam.
[247:30.60]You'll need to switch auxiliary power using the unreliable, then head to the bridge.
[247:36.00]Your navigational computer ada should be able to activate the hope skip drive.
[247:42.00]Once you've skipped the hope next to my lab I'll have easy access to the frozen colonists.
[247:47.00]I can start reviving them immediately.
[247:49.96]I can't wait for the Jerma Rumble 2019 or 20.
[247:56.24]When it's the dentist versus somebody else in a tag match.
[247:58.44]It'll be interesting, I think.
[248:01.71]Let's do it!
[248:02.19]I know you're wondering why I'm doing all this.
[248:05.11]Why I believe the people of the Hope are the answer to the colony's problems.
[248:10.05]the hope is carrying some of humanity's most brilliant thinkers scientists engineers experts in their field if we work together we can still find a way to save halcyon the board would have us believe halcyon is beyond saving I choose to believe otherwise if there's even the slightest chance we can save halcyon from oblivion then we have to take it okay
[248:36.69]By the way, why are you hiding behind bulletproof glass?
[248:39.17]It took me this long.
[248:39.91]That is bullshit.
[248:40.83]That's a lie.
[248:41.31]That's an absolute... That's... No.
[248:42.95]Alright.
[248:43.25]Level 20.
[248:43.55]I thought this was a big brain.
[249:09.47]Oh, what's wrong with me?
[249:10.67]Alright, I'm standing next to something I'm terrified of.
[249:14.39]12!
[249:16.43]13 to 9.
[249:17.15]26!
[249:17.51]Okay, you gotta go.
[249:21.45]You gotta go.
[249:24.37]You're out of here.
[249:25.05]I'm sorry.
[249:25.71]I need a new dentist.
[249:32.26]Let's just make it work.
[249:33.24]Let's get to like 100. 80.
[249:46.93]Reduce damage from area effect and plasma.
[249:52.09]More carrying capacity.
[249:56.50]This one's not terrible.
[250:01.34]More damage with low health.
[250:02.44]That's pretty good.
[250:09.36]Yeah, I'll do it.
[250:14.66]And you...
[250:18.39]Showtime.
[250:18.99]Damage plus 25.
[250:20.31]Increases the damage dealt by this companion after performing Showtime.
[250:23.91]Yeah.
[250:26.47]Sam, it's been fun.
[250:29.55]See you later.
[250:37.20]Goodbye.
[250:38.88]You can stay on the ship and... There's a pig over here.
[250:51.71]Oh, wow.
[250:55.47]It's an Omega Pig.
[250:56.55]I didn't think those things existed.
[251:03.66]Alright, let's go.
[251:04.96]Let's do it.
[251:05.44]Let's actually do this.
[251:06.46]Let's do this.
[251:07.84]Let's go for it.
[251:21.54]Keep Sam.
[251:24.06]No, Sam scares me.
[251:28.94]Hope docking bay.
[251:29.54]You wanna be CEO?
[251:30.14]Hope!
[251:30.36]Let's go to the Hope.
[251:52.55]We have arrived at the Hope.
[251:54.17]Cool.
[251:54.53]I need you to reroute power from our ship to the Hope's auxiliary generator.
[251:58.59]You'll have to connect me to the Hope's comm system so I can convince her central computer to enable the skip drive.
[252:04.89]We're gonna get a robot fight?
[252:05.93]An AI fight?
[252:08.41]What's gonna happen if I skip the Hope?
[252:09.81]If your calculations are even slightly off, you could crash the entire colony ship into Terra 2.
[252:16.48]Or the sun.
[252:17.02]Oh, good thing I'm great at math.
[252:19.82]I know all the best numbers.
[252:21.90]I must recommend you leave the calculations up to me, Captain.
[252:25.39]You've got so many numbers.
[252:26.35]So many big numbers.
[252:27.23]You've got the best numbers.
[252:30.91]In brackets.
[252:32.05]Trump.
[252:34.82]Alright.
[252:38.00]That's all for now.
[252:40.92]Talk to that computer and let us know how it goes.
[252:52.63]I like your special move you breathe down my neck why don't you okay hope power hope comes
[253:23.02]patch yeah power is now being removed from the docking bay patch ada into the hopes communication system status power cool maintenance looks good hibernation storage seems alright logs cool something about waking a derelict ship puts me on edge
[253:53.28]I don't.
[253:53.86]Who are you?
[253:54.22]Who the hell is this?
[254:03.04]Alright, comms.
[254:09.19]Oh.
[254:10.13]We have to talk to Quincy Duncan.
[254:14.05]Uh... I was sent to repair the reactor so it doesn't explode and take out the colony.
[254:18.51]They sent me to extract a few samples from your, uh, frozen cargo.
[254:21.23]It's gross.
[254:44.33]Yeah, and, uh, engineer life.
[254:46.41]Thank you.
[254:47.38]To your right.
[254:48.62]To my right.
[254:50.80]Right.
[254:50.98]Okay.
[255:24.39]Well, that looks... Did I take everything?
[255:31.00]Alright, this whole starving to death thing isn't all that cracked up to be on the upside.
[255:38.47]The bathroom's the cleanest they've ever been since we left port.
[255:41.83]Whoa.
[255:44.35]Alright, do I have a... Do I have one?
[255:59.89]I just need the ID card.
[256:01.07]Oh.
[256:02.31]Alright, let's break some of this shit down.
[256:03.53]Alright, I'm gonna sell you robes.
[256:06.43]No, I don't.
[256:10.23]Anti-riot gear.
[256:11.53]I mean, that's cool, but I don't need two of them.
[256:20.49]What guns?
[256:21.90]Yeah, a lot of just... 350, that's not... Man, that's terrible.
[256:26.06]Now, that's pretty cool.
[256:26.74]I'm gonna give that to the priest.
[256:31.93]Stun Baton Ultra.
[256:35.72]I gotta give some better weapons.
[256:37.46]Because the things that they have kind of suck.
[256:42.80]Yeah, alright, here.
[256:43.54]I need a... You.
[256:45.46]What do you have?
[256:47.52]You good with melee?
[256:50.38]No, you're the melee.
[256:51.26]Here.
[256:52.52]And take this instead.
[256:55.42]Take the flamethrower.
[256:56.38]Let's go.
[256:58.40]No.
[256:58.58]That doesn't make any sense for you.
[257:00.76]That's out of character for you.
[257:02.40]You don't have two handed guns.
[257:08.66]Keep the tactical shotgun.
[257:13.22]You use the flamethrower.
[257:20.90]Way to go.
[257:23.65]And the stun baton.
[257:26.97]Now we're ready.
[257:32.69]Let's do, uh, Harmful Status Effects.
[257:34.53]Alright, right.
[257:40.38]Thank you!
[257:43.44]So why is this some kind of weird disguise costume thing, when the guy just told me, hey, you're a new recruit.
[257:48.08]Why do I have this costume on?
[257:50.96]I'm supposed to be here.
[257:51.98]What do you mean, what?
[257:55.18]I'm supposed to be here.
[257:55.81]That's bad advice.
[258:08.98]Excuse me.
[258:34.77]I'm almost out of juice.
[258:35.71]Out of juice.
[258:43.48]I can't lie to a robot.
[258:50.84]Robot communications!
[258:53.29]Wait, wait, it wants to talk to me.
[258:54.79]It said it wanted to talk to me!
[258:56.47]It said it wanted to talk!
[258:57.67]There was a, hey, I have to ask you a question.
[259:01.03]It said, like, hey, I have to ask you, talking.
[259:02.99]I took too long?
[259:05.15]What?
[259:29.96]Oh, ayayay.
[259:42.90]No, I didn't say ayayay, I said ayayay.
[260:06.72]Can you hear me, Captain?
[260:08.44]I have successfully integrated myself into the Hope's comm systems, and I'm attempting to establish contact with the Hope's more primitive processor now.
[260:19.01]Would you like me to play a mood-suitable music selection while you travel to the bridge?
[260:23.93]Oh, sorry.
[260:25.47]File not found.
[260:28.26]I'm currently trying to not get spotted by these monsters.
[260:34.26]I need some... Okay, I need to talk to somebody.
[260:35.84]I need somebody to see me.
[260:39.66]That's not a robot.
[261:07.58]Oh.
[261:10.02]Well, that was a good little skip.
[261:13.78]Ah, fuck.
[261:18.54]Wait.
[261:20.02]Can I- Is this correct?
[261:26.41]Is this taking me out?
[261:32.39]I think so.
[261:32.81]Oh, there we go.
[261:40.29]Have a nice day.
[261:43.74]That's the Hope's computer up ahead.
[261:46.38]I'll admit, I am curious to wake him.
[261:51.32]I hope you guys work it out.
[261:55.42]Patch Ada through.
[261:56.30]Greetings, Captain.
[261:57.92]I am speaking to you through the Hope's computer system.
[262:00.94]It's a rather cramped feeling, but it'll do.
[262:03.56]I'm ready to skip Hope.
[262:09.87]Tell me, Ada.
[262:10.31]Am I really doing the right thing?
[262:11.53]I don't want... No.
[262:12.57]I'm ready to skip Hope.
[262:14.97]Are you sure?
[262:15.53]That is extremely dangerous.
[262:18.03]Skipping the Hope will void the warranty on the skip drive.
[262:22.43]and also potentially kill an entire planet.
[262:25.59]How is my humor now, Captain?
[262:27.23]Improved?
[262:31.79]Skip.
[262:32.35]Jump starting the skip drive.
[262:34.15]Destination set to the rings of Terra 2.
[262:41.15]Jumping destination, okay, do it.
[262:44.03]If we're meant to make it, we will.
[262:46.39]No use worrying otherwise.
[262:48.79]Doing it.
[262:49.65]I mean, affirmative.
[262:51.37]Skipping the hope in three, two, one.
[262:55.36]ADA, does your captain seriously intend to do a micro jump in system with engines that haven't been powered in 70 years on a derelict ship?
[263:05.79]That is what my captain intends, yes.
[263:09.01]What?
[263:09.19]What do you mean, hold on to something?
[263:56.76]Alright, bring him home.
[264:01.42]Why is it pointing at the sun?
[264:12.82]Into the sun.
[264:21.79]We did it!
[264:25.39]It made it.
[264:26.39]We are still alive and have successfully skipped into Terra 2's orbit.
[264:30.91]I reported as much to Phineas Wells, but he has not responded.
[264:34.83]Perhaps you should check in on him.
[264:36.57]I will.
[264:37.76]We're alive.
[264:38.64]We made it.
[264:39.98]I never had any doubts.
[264:42.66]Alright.
[264:43.08]Everyone's alive.
[264:43.72]Look.
[264:45.62]Okay.
[264:46.92]Good.
[264:48.54]Let's do a little bit of...
[264:53.97]Let's get handguns to 80.
[264:57.32]Debuffed enemy critical chance minus 20%.
[264:59.12]And let's put lie.
[265:03.28]I have 108 lie now.
[265:07.12]No one's gonna get anything by me.
[265:10.65]Nice work.
[265:11.01]Nice work.
[265:27.14]Uh, catch me being bad.
[265:31.15]No, not you!
[265:32.49]The Pumon, so I can get my disguise back.
[265:50.45]Error.
[265:51.37]Hope crew data not found.
[265:53.33]Identify yourself.
[265:56.18]I was in one of the pods I just woke up.
[265:57.80]If you're experiencing errors, I'll just take you to a mechanical engineer.
[266:00.07]This statement is false.
[266:02.09]Error.
[266:02.69]Paradox protection protocols have prevented me from registering your stated identification.
[266:09.03]Please report to your nearest mechanical engineer.
[266:10.67]You can't lie to robots.
[266:12.59]They don't even know what it is.
[266:13.99]Everything I say is false.
[266:15.09]Error.
[266:15.89]Paradox prevention has temporarily disabled this unit's auditory processing.
[266:21.09]Thank you for your cooperation.
[266:22.81]You're welcome.
[266:30.85]Back to the lab.
[266:31.71]Can I teleport now?
[266:36.01]Nope.
[266:44.22]I killed him?
[266:48.12]There's no... You don't kill a robot.
[266:51.78]They just unplug.
[266:59.07]This is the wrong fucking area.
[267:06.84]Excuse me.
[267:07.44]Excuse me.
[267:08.32]Excuse me.
[267:09.00]Excuse me.
[267:14.42]Excuse me.
[267:18.49]Saw something.
[267:19.73]I don't recognize you.
[267:20.73]Are you new here?
[267:21.33]Mind your own business.
[267:26.16]What's your problem?
[267:29.28]You.
[267:30.32]Relax.
[267:30.92]I'm not looking for a fight.
[267:34.81]Alright.
[267:41.38]Here we go.
[267:41.86]Alright.
[267:44.32]Alright.
[267:44.96]Alright.
[267:45.22]Alright.
[267:46.36]Alright.
[267:46.56]Alright.
[267:47.00]Alright.
[267:50.34]Okay.
[267:59.35]Just get out of here.
[268:05.58]How do I get back on my ship?
[268:08.00]There's a tiny little bridge.
[268:11.93]What is colder than cold?
[268:15.73]Freon.
[268:26.09]Captain, I am receiving a transmission from Dr. Wells.
[268:29.72]Captain, I shall now play the transmission I received from Dr. Wells.
[268:33.04]You fool!
[268:33.32]You did the bad thing!
[268:34.42]The board is here.
[268:35.42]They found me somehow.
[268:37.08]They're about to blast my door open.
[268:38.92]You got that glass?
[268:40.17]I can't help them from getting me, and there isn't enough time to explain everything.
[268:44.31]But there's something very important you need to remember.
[268:48.47]Uh...
[269:19.57]Can you make cereal or something?
[269:21.07]I haven't eaten in 12 days.
[269:24.08]Sandwich of ham or anything?
[269:25.06]Cool.
[269:39.73]Tell me about the captain.
[269:41.55]I put my feet up on the chair and fold them.
[269:43.99]Tell me, what about that captain?
[269:45.15]I require a captain to pilot the ship.
[269:47.49]Without an identified captain or crew, I serve no purpose.
[269:51.92]As you may be aware, Captain Alex Hawthorne was a smuggler of some repute.
[269:57.34]I failed to predict the likely outcome of his reckless behavioral patterns.
[270:02.61]Outlaw.
[270:02.75]Okay, I'm done.
[270:03.35]I guess we'll go check on Phineas.
[270:04.99]Phineas.
[270:05.33]I'm coming to save you.
[270:27.33]Alright, let me just take care of business again And we're gonna bring the dream team even if I'm scared oh
[270:57.40]Did they get him?
[270:57.98]Uh-oh.
[271:02.94]Alchemy books.
[271:08.23]Oh, they left the pig.
[271:12.43]They can't get in.
[271:13.37]How can they not?
[271:20.01]As per official arrest protocol outlined in defense logistic incarceration document the individual who has been detained at this location must appear in an official halcyon court at the appointed date and time.
[271:30.01]With this paperwork and failure to appear at the appointed date and time with this paperwork will result in additional late fees please know that this is the only copy of this receipt that you'll receive and it's your responsibility to have it with you when you appear for your resident registration.
[271:47.00]Yeah. Can I be his lawyer?
[272:00.38]Max.
[272:01.44]What?
[272:01.92]They wanted to talk?
[272:35.73]Talk about what?
[272:36.41]I can't wait to go on the epic rescue mission.
[272:44.10]Check your armor.
[272:47.04]It's all good.
[272:47.52]It's good.
[272:50.33]Alright, what did you want?
[272:51.11]You don't... Okay, you don't want to talk.
[273:06.29]I'm fucking dying instantly.
[273:10.08]Okay, what the hell?
[273:12.14]There's a stupid robot next to me.
[273:26.74]You made your bed, now you have to sleep in it.
[273:29.54]Fine.
[273:41.74]Why was there only one bullet in this gun?
[273:53.31]What is he doing?
[273:56.81]Holy shit.
[273:59.73]Oh god, oh god, oh god.
[274:07.30]Sam!
[274:12.48]Alright, if I'm standing far away from him, he doesn't affect me.
[274:18.65]Oh shit, oh jeez.
[274:23.25]Oh shit, oh jeez, Rick.
[274:25.63]Why are you saying that, and why am I repeating it?
[274:38.94]Poster?
[274:39.86]Whose poster is this?
[274:44.55]Alright, let's get in there.
[274:46.54]Obscure body in the SK system.
[274:59.50]Did he leave a video recording for me?
[275:03.54]Publishing last will and testament.
[275:05.14]Please present login.
[275:06.64]Hack it.
[275:08.44]If you're seeing this screen, I, Phineas V. Wells, have been peculiarly kidnapped and very probably incarcerated by the perfidious and cowardly government of Halcyon in the prison fortress of Tartarus.
[275:22.03]If I have not already been executed for charges leveled against me, I hope the person reading this terminal will find a way to finish my work or rescue me, preferably the latter.
[275:31.77]This screen constitutes my last will and testament.
[275:34.80]I commend my body and my belongings to the icy depths of the ether.
[275:39.22]If this is Junko, I've prepared an emergency care package located in the hidden panel.
[275:44.30]Unlock the panel from my terminal and claim its contents immediately.
[275:48.72]Got it.
[275:52.63]You're supposed to burp.
[275:56.97]Must delete entries from terminal memory.
[275:58.95]No telling who might be looking.
[276:00.15]What's this one say?
[276:01.88]Exposition.
[276:03.16]Exposition.
[276:04.34]I've got my notes with me.
[276:05.36]I have my equipment.
[276:06.18]And now I have this lab.
[276:07.18]It's time I return to work.
[276:09.18]Only the hopes colonists can forgive me for what I've done.
[276:11.86]They're the only people who can set things right.
[276:14.84]And I'm going to find a way to revive them, no matter how long I have to stay hiding.
[276:19.05]They say I'm a murderer, and they're right I am.
[276:21.77]I regret what I've done, but I'm not about to turn myself into the board.
[276:25.21]I'm not going to go begging the board for forgiveness.
[276:28.13]I always suspected this would happen.
[276:30.07]The board finally discovered what I'd done and sent their headhunters to track me down, but they'll never find me.
[276:38.33]On to the subject number 13.
[276:41.04]Can still hear the screaming, trouble sleeping, trouble concentrating, psychological toll significant.
[276:46.26]Statistically insignificant.
[276:48.02]If I experimented on the subject every month, I would not make a dent in the Hope's population in a lifetime.
[276:52.97]He was my 12th subject to die.
[276:55.97]don't know how much longer I can keep doing this strictly speaking I do know the hope has hundreds of thousands of colonists I've only experimented on 12 how many more experiments must I do before I revive a single subject 110 100 500 113 seconds of screaming this subject was stronger than the others but in the end his body failed to survive the revival process thanks a lot doctor secret panel
[277:36.85]Nav key I haven't slept once Tartarus
[278:08.01]Let's go get the professor.
[278:14.70]New weapon.
[278:17.48]Fins Force.
[278:18.94]Long gun.
[278:20.00]Energy.
[278:20.88]Tinker it.
[278:22.02]Replace this.
[278:22.64]Is it a science weapon?
[278:26.42]Cool.
[278:26.76]That's a... What does it do?
[278:33.95]Wow.
[278:36.75]Time to tinker.
[278:43.81]It's pretty neat.
[278:52.92]Tinker armor, please read.
[278:54.32]Important.
[278:56.46]Yeah, actually, you're right.
[278:58.14]Didn't I request no more fertilizer shipments be brought on board?
[279:03.43]Siri, unplug yourself.
[279:06.21]Alright, tinker!
[279:07.59]First of all, let's tinker this.
[279:12.85]I can't?
[279:15.25]What?
[279:21.27]I can't be tinkered?
[279:24.92]Well, we're gonna tinker this.
[279:32.40]46 armor.
[279:33.08]We'll do it one more time.
[279:33.90]48 armor.
[279:37.78]36 armor.
[279:38.30]Let's get it up again.
[279:39.16]Here we go.
[279:39.98]41 armor.
[279:41.86]Good.
[279:42.58]Tinkered.
[279:44.04]Can anything else be tinkered?
[279:46.86]Hmm, not really.
[279:50.26]Based?
[279:50.80]Based?
[279:51.20]What are you doing?
[279:53.80]Repair everything, might as well.
[279:58.41]This is the final battle of the game.
[279:59.79]I'm repairing all my stuff.
[280:15.57]What?
[280:16.23]People have concerns?
[280:36.68]Who has concerns?
[280:39.24]A meeting of the round table of the dentists.
[280:40.89]I ain't exactly keen on busting into a prison, but riddling board stooges with bullets does sound like a ride and a half.
[280:53.66]To extract the scientist, you will need to infiltrate the labyrinth, but that course of action is likely to be quite dangerous, Captain.
[281:01.16]It's because you took off your dentist outfit.
[281:06.53]What's so bad about the labyrinth?
[281:07.69]We can't abandon Phineas.
[281:08.73]We have to free him if we have any hope of saving the colony.
[281:10.69]Great.
[281:10.97]Figures I've got to be the one to save the day again.
[281:12.85]Look at it as saving the day.
[281:14.75]Look at it as securing your investment.
[281:17.23]Phineas owes you big time.
[281:20.03]I'm sure the outlaw Phineas will appreciate you saving his day, as it were, Captain.
[281:25.22]If you really mean to do this, you should see to your final affairs and close out any unfinished business.
[281:31.20]Once you sneak into Tartarus, you may be there a while.
[281:34.94]Or permanently.
[281:37.97]We're doing it, everybody.
[281:38.69]Strap in.
[281:42.35]Everybody, strap in.
[281:44.37]You're a good friend.
[281:45.03]Sorry we never found your French book.
[282:06.35]Waiting for me.
[282:07.41]Alright.
[282:22.75]Nothing else in here.
[282:23.45]Okay.
[282:24.47]Alright, let's go.
[282:25.69]We want a speech.
[282:29.77]Don't fuck it up.
[282:30.67]Don't fuck it up.
[282:31.63]Don't fuck it up.
[282:32.57]Don't fuck it up.
[282:34.42]Are we clear?
[282:36.06]Good.
[282:36.28]10%.
[282:38.98]10%.
[282:39.96]10%.
[282:40.98]10%.
[282:41.90]60%.
[282:46.68]Good.
[282:56.09]You can't take those chairs either.
[282:57.31]Those are mine.
[282:58.67]And the couch.
[283:00.91]Oh, and at least two or three of you are going to die.
[283:04.15]And that thing's already dead.
[283:05.03]It's not even real.
[283:06.43]Good luck.
[283:15.38]Message for Junko.
[283:17.80]No messages.
[283:18.42]Nobody ever fucking sends me emails.
[283:50.90]See?
[283:52.20]Be ready for anything.
[284:01.09]I forget where my chair is.
[284:06.88]On to Tartarus.
[284:07.50]You're about to assault the labyrinth on Tartarus and determine the fate of the Halcyon colony.
[284:11.29]If there's anything you want to do before entering the prison, do it now.
[284:15.47]This is it.
[284:15.95]This is the end of the game.
[284:16.87]If you end the game now, you're not going to be able to find Max's book.
[284:20.82]Bye.
[284:22.46]Sure.
[284:30.26]Alright.
[284:30.88]Ellie, you have to walk off the ship first.
[284:47.98]Resident count is as follows.
[284:50.90]3,071.
[284:52.32]Resident deaths, including but not limited to executions, are as follows.
[284:57.68]1,684.
[284:57.70]Resident escapes are as follows.
[285:02.17]Zero.
[285:03.33]The interior can be chilly.
[285:05.35]Take a scarf with you, Captain.
[285:06.69]I would also ask that you leave your Captain's ID with me.
[285:10.69]In the event that you do not return.
[285:12.34]And then another captain will come.
[285:13.76]Nice try.
[285:14.84]Nice try.
[285:15.64]Understood.
[285:16.18]If you die or are incarcerated for life, I can generate a new ID for the next captain.
[285:21.89]I would prefer if you returned, though.
[285:25.30]Oh, speak of the devil.
[285:27.02]Captain, I am receiving a transmission from the prison's docking authority now.
[285:30.97]Let's talk shit.
[285:32.01]Attention, unauthorized spacecraft.
[285:34.49]This is a maximum security installation.
[285:36.93]Your presence here is an explicit violation of UDL corporate policy.
[285:40.99]Alright.
[285:41.71]You are hereby confined to your docking platform until a ticket detailing your crimes has been filed and notarized.
[285:48.19]At which point, your vessel will be seized and you will be executed.
[285:51.80]By you?
[285:53.14]Well...
[285:56.63]uh how long will that take I wager it'll take a bit longer than it takes you to lose your patience and storm out of your ship looking to get shot to be honest that'd make my job a lot easier you come out and shoot you full of holes and then everyone goes about their day worry-free except you you'll be dead okay true uh fine uh execute the chairman's eyebrow stylist over a lost biometric id that'll end pretty well wait you're the stylist
[286:26.28]uh thank the law you're here everyone knows how particular the chairman is about his eyebrows here take my biometric id instead anyway tartar stocking authority signing up hang on another ship just pulled into your dock wait is that from the groundbreaker what the pay no mind to that just have a pleasant day biometric id received transferring data to external cartridge how can I be of assistance
[286:58.20]Uh... Goodbye.
[287:00.02]Have a nice life.
[287:04.42]Okay.
[287:12.88]Alright, we haven't used Ellie in a while.
[287:18.61]Bye, Sam.
[287:29.93]Sam only?
[287:36.44]Why would I ever do that?
[287:39.96]Alright, you two.
[287:40.58]I mean, you're only here because I'm scared of the robot.
[287:46.49]But, I have a lot of faith in you.
[287:49.57]You're a good dentist.
[287:52.05]So are you.
[288:01.75]Elevator.
[288:02.91]No, I'm allowed to be here.
[288:03.91]I'm the stylist.
[288:04.53]I'm just the stylist.
[288:31.80]See ya.
[288:32.66]Just a stylus coming through.
[288:40.92]Alright.
[288:47.36]RP walking.
[289:03.05]I let them die?
[289:09.45]No, I have a very specific mission I'm supposed to be doing.
[289:24.72]Yeah, it is a little too late.
[289:27.28]You want to go back?
[289:28.32]There's a war going on outside.
[289:30.54]And you don't even have a fucking costume anymore.
[289:33.86]Well, now you do.
[289:58.85]Alright, coming in.
[290:03.46]No!
[290:05.64]I have to go up.
[290:08.72]It's alright, I can get caught once.
[290:21.79]Nice.
[290:24.17]Look at that, that wasn't so hard.
[290:25.27]Hey, final battle.
[290:27.99]Might as well get some final stuff.
[290:29.35]How much money do I have?
[290:32.94]Whoa, what's this?
[290:34.22]Cotton candy outfit.
[290:39.66]No.
[290:41.76]No, not worth it.
[290:42.62]Let's go.
[290:51.20]I have 71 heals, so I don't think I need any more of this.
[290:55.66]Well, let's save it in here.
[290:56.48]Restricted access.
[290:59.51]Transition to the pit.
[291:05.73]What kind of former dentist would wear a cotton candy outfit?
[291:07.93]I don't know, like a child dentist?
[291:17.25]Fuck.
[291:19.31]Wait, restart it.
[291:20.81]No, just run.
[291:31.00]Imagine not having a hundred lives.
[291:41.16]Talk to me.
[291:42.36]Talk to me.
[291:46.89]I was hired to test your security procedures.
[291:48.61]Congratulations, you did it.
[291:51.29]You're welcome.
[291:53.71]Thank you.
[291:55.56]Goodbye.
[292:03.90]Didn't we say we were gonna, like, fight our way through here?
[292:07.69]I haven't raised a finger.
[292:14.63]We're going out!
[292:15.27]It's gonna be so dangerous!
[292:16.95]Guns blazing!
[292:17.89]Let's go for it!
[292:19.03]No, I'm j- this is just walking to where I need to go.
[292:29.52]Pit exit.
[292:30.22]Uh-oh.
[292:31.26]Uh-oh.
[292:32.48]Uh-oh.
[292:33.12]Uh-oh.
[292:33.70]Uh-oh.
[292:34.26]Uh-oh.
[292:35.16]Is it enough?
[292:36.90]It's enough.
[292:39.88]Have to go up?
[293:00.36]Oh shit.
[293:10.65]Is there any drugs I can take to make it so I can... I know, I haven't been feeling well.
[293:15.43]Get out of my way.
[293:15.81]Do not disturb when lights are on.
[293:41.11]Open the door.
[293:47.76]There.
[293:50.84]We should have just killed him.
[293:55.64]I'm still disguised as the stylist.
[294:09.98]These days, I'm more interested in breaking them.
[294:11.90]Wouldn't mind taking a swing at yours.
[294:13.88]Stylist eyebrows.
[294:18.88]You know, most people, once they're out of prison, don't seem keen on returning.
[294:24.06]Oh, I would go anywhere to see you fall, sir.
[294:28.51]When you go off and get yourself shot, try to avoid taking one to the face.
[294:33.23]I'll want it recognizable to show to my citizens.
[294:39.15]uh chairman rockwell I presume my word you've correctly identified the most recognizable man in the colony remarkable I just want to make sure because when they find your teeth lying around they'll be able to identify you then again he's an insane person thankfully he's our insane person now a proper company man I'll see if please phoenix would rather die than cooperate
[295:07.05]yes he is an extraordinarily obstinate fellow isn't he fine he isn't working for us per se semantics he'll come around but that's between us as far as my adoring citizens will know we've turned a dangerous crackpot into a working class man it's a miracle is this the I feel like I haven't had enough time to care that this guy's a villain
[295:31.77]was like this guy's chairman rockwell and here's a video and I'll hate this guy it was like that was like 30 minutes ago uh alright um that's a lie it's pr it's for the best really believe me the good people of byzantium don't want to know what goes on here I know halcyon's in rough shape but riots are the last thing anybody needs right now
[296:01.28]And another thing, why wear a tie?
[296:06.95]I believe we could ask you the same.
[296:09.55]I'm making actual progress towards stabilization and recovery.
[296:13.45]You're just getting in the way.
[296:17.96]You'd prefer to keep riding this downward spiral.
[296:20.14]I can fix this place.
[296:22.24]I can do it.
[296:22.66]Oh.
[296:36.69]Well, the problem is I've already rallied all of Byzantium against you.
[296:41.83]They're outside waiting, and they're angry.
[296:44.65]You... you have?
[296:47.13]Is that what you were doing at the Ministry?
[296:49.74]Look, I'm not an unreasonable man.
[296:52.98]If you manage to storm the castle, as it were, and make it out of here with Phineas alive... I can't exactly afford more havoc than you've already caused.
[297:02.48]Fine!
[297:03.72]If you survive, you'll need someone to sell the rest of the board on your plan.
[297:09.44]Right, because it'll be me.
[297:14.28]You're damn right.
[297:16.00]Just wait here for my orders.
[297:21.93]And tell your dog to stop.
[297:28.13]That was easy.
[297:29.49]Just stay there.
[297:34.37]Phineas!
[297:42.55]Shoot him?
[297:42.89]No, no, no, not yet.
[297:43.89]Not yet.
[297:44.25]Wait.
[297:45.13]Patience.
[297:56.21]One of your runs?
[297:56.75]He won't.
[298:00.77]I don't see what the fuss is about a blasted lab coat.
[298:04.85]Wait, that's the person I hung up on.
[298:12.11]Captain.
[298:31.11]You have an uncanny talent for complicating my life.
[298:35.54]You've disrupted the balance of power.
[298:38.52]You've upset the natural order of things.
[298:41.95]You've introduced uncertainty and there is nothing I despise more than uncertainty.
[298:48.86]uh it's over Sophia stand down we are liberating halcyon and there's not a damn thing you can do to stop us wow when you put it that way I sound pretty awesome typical running your mouth in the middle of a crisis it's almost as if you delighted chaos my report said you were simple constant I simply never imagined you'd be stupid enough to throw the entire system into chaos I should have dealt with you a long time ago
[299:17.96]You were always too dangerous to leave unchecked.
[299:23.36]I got a colony to save.
[299:24.34]Stop, you're making me blush.
[299:26.80]Can we hurry this up?
[299:27.62]I've got an entire colony to save.
[299:30.23]Leaving you alive was my greatest mistake.
[299:33.11]But it is a mistake I intend to correct.
[299:37.18]I have Dr. Wells in my custody.
[299:39.34]I don't care.
[299:39.66]Kill him.
[299:40.12]Once I've secured his cooperation, I can move forward with the program.
[299:44.88]I can repair the damage you've done.
[299:46.98]What is it?
[299:47.26]I don't care.
[299:47.56]Kill him.
[299:48.04]Whatever.
[299:48.28]I can set things right.
[299:49.52]I... I don't... Whatever.
[299:53.08]Don't... You don't understand.
[299:55.92]Phineas is my friend.
[299:56.58]I'm not living without him.
[299:57.78]Don't test me, Sophia.
[299:58.62]It's bad for your health.
[299:59.38]I don't enjoy the thought of killing you.
[300:00.52]There's been enough violence already.
[300:06.70]Uh, don't test me, Sophia.
[300:08.28]It's bad for your health.
[300:09.16]I'm aware of your propensity for violence.
[300:11.68]Halcyon is a bloodier place because of you.
[300:14.96]I wish you'd simply cooperated with me.
[300:17.20]You're the finest marksman in Halcyon.
[300:19.98]You could have been my gun.
[300:21.46]Okay.
[300:25.44]Um... Let's talk.
[300:30.03]Fair enough.
[300:31.47]I'm giving you exactly one chance to parlay with me.
[300:34.23]Mm-hmm.
[300:43.54]Dumb?
[300:44.56]Intimidate?
[300:45.88]80.
[300:46.16]Heavy weapons?
[300:47.69]50.
[300:47.85]Two-handed melee?
[300:48.77]80.
[300:49.13]Oh, you do not want to party with me.
[300:53.31]It's gonna be a big bloody mess.
[301:01.84]Okay.
[301:02.92]Charm.
[301:03.34]I don't want to fight you, Sophia.
[301:04.60]You're one of the only rational people left.
[301:06.88]Anyone with eyes can see that you're talented, Captain.
[301:10.36]I only wish you'd used your talents for good.
[301:12.88]Yeah.
[301:13.59]You wander the system, doing as you please, answering to no one.
[301:17.69]Your mere existence throws Halcyon into chaos.
[301:21.21]I simply can't have that.
[301:22.63]Uh, Halcyon is changing and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
[301:26.90]It's time to let go.
[301:27.70]I'm not throwing Halcyon into chaos.
[301:29.48]The board's doing that all by themselves.
[301:31.92]The board is the only power left in Halcyon.
[301:35.24]We're the only ones keeping this colony from dissolving into ruin.
[301:39.51]You had so much potential.
[301:41.63]I would have put your talents to good use.
[301:44.15]I would have made you wealthy beyond belief.
[301:47.51]What is this, the Matrix?
[301:49.39]Okay.
[301:50.61]Great.
[301:51.89]Cool story.
[301:56.91]Agent Smith.
[302:04.01]Yeah.
[302:05.53]That ship's been skipped.
[302:07.79]I still can't believe you skipped the hope to Terra 2.
[302:11.77]What an absolutely reckless thing to do.
[302:14.76]You put the future of this entire colony in jeopardy.
[302:17.96]Alright, should I do like a my phone's running out of battery?
[302:20.40]I gotta go?
[302:22.28]I tried to recruit you, but you threw your lot in with that- Oh, she keeps going.
[302:26.55]I don't even know who this is.
[302:28.05]Am I supposed to know who this is?
[302:32.61]Oh, you could've- NO!
[302:42.83]Funny you should say that because the chairman was just telling me this is all your fault.
[302:45.95]I don't have a hundred lie.
[302:48.73]No.
[302:50.01]No.
[302:56.82]Ruined.
[302:57.38]Ruined.
[302:57.90]Ruined.
[302:58.22]The ultimate lie.
[303:00.40]The ultimate lie.
[303:01.66]Your plan's never gonna work.
[303:06.68]Yes, I'm quite aware of your brazen act of corporate vandalism.
[303:10.20]Reset the game.
[303:10.78]When was the last time I saved it?
[303:12.38]Reload, reload.
[303:13.24]I know, but I have... Where did I do it?
[303:14.54]Where was it?
[303:16.78]Oh, it was not that far.
[303:17.88]15, 9?
[303:17.92]This one here?
[303:18.44]Yeah, I'm going for 100.
[303:19.36]I mean, I did all points in the Y. I have to.
[303:44.84]Alright.
[303:49.85]Lie.
[303:50.05]It was a lying suit.
[303:50.93]I know there's a lying suit.
[303:54.63]Dialogue skills plus five.
[303:57.24]Character.
[303:58.62]Skills.
[303:59.30]Lie.
[303:59.62]108.
[303:59.64]108.
[303:59.72]Let's go.
[304:15.77]Alright.
[304:18.63]I sound pretty awesome.
[304:22.19]Alright, but first of all, I should have dealt with you long ago.
[304:25.23]You could have been my hired gun.
[304:28.07]You could have done so many things.
[304:30.39]You should know who I am.
[304:32.17]You should know from maybe the first few hours of the game I could have been a character.
[304:37.91]Who the fuck is this?
[304:42.07]I hung up on you maybe 40 minutes ago in the game.
[304:45.41]These last two major antagonist characters that they've introduced, I don't even know who these people are.
[304:52.07]I met them like an hour ago.
[304:59.83]Did I fuck it up?
[305:03.11]What did I skip?
[305:08.59]Alright, I got a colony to save.
[305:12.60]Right, let's talk about this.
[305:14.66]I don't want to fight you.
[305:17.60]You're one of the only rational people left.
[305:19.96]I do.
[305:23.97]I'm not throwing Halcyon into chaos.
[305:26.67]The board's doing that all by themselves.
[305:28.81]Okay.
[305:29.09]Yeah, that ship's been skipped.
[305:36.35]I still can't believe you skipped the hope to Terra 2.
[305:40.00]I know.
[305:40.30]You were always... Well, here's the thing.
[305:44.00]Funny you should say that because the chairman was just telling me that this is all your fault.
[305:48.70]Rockwell said that.
[305:50.70]Chairman Rockwell.
[305:53.36]That's absurd.
[305:55.74]You're lying.
[305:57.32]This is another one of your tricks.
[305:59.90]I've been the chairman's most reliable associate.
[306:02.72]Good.
[306:02.94]We got that info at the end of the game.
[306:04.92]uh sophie's been overstepping her bounds his words not mine I've already recruited the chairman to my side he's done working with you you let the situation get out of hand rockwell wants you gone
[306:19.29]That's ridiculous.
[306:21.13]Halcyon is collapsing.
[306:22.56]The labyrinth is riding.
[306:23.74]You're running wild through the colony.
[306:25.46]And I let the situation get out of hand?
[306:28.22]That's what he said.
[306:30.52]Nothing less than a lifetime of loyal, honorable service.
[306:34.71]And this is how he repays me.
[306:36.79]By leaving me twisting in the wind.
[306:41.41]Everyone's disposable to the board, Sophie.
[306:44.15]Even you.
[306:47.50]enough I'm not going to stand here bickering with you I was expecting the chairman's support but I'll have to do without he also said I dare you to come try to shoot me on the program yet you've caused some complications but I can improvise I can fix this he said I haven't lost control of the lab I bet she can't open the door and fire within a second operational I can still put a stop to you
[307:20.58]I'm sorry.
[307:20.98]I was taking over a security system in the process.
[307:24.33]I'm not a hacker.
[307:25.27]I can't get to 80 hack.
[307:26.05]I can't get to 80 hack.
[307:27.61]I don't have it.
[307:32.23]No, I can't.
[307:40.78]Game sucks.
[307:41.46]I can't do it.
[307:43.45]I haven't lost control elaborate on security.
[307:45.51]I destroyed your experiments in the ministry your plans never gonna work Yes, I'm quite aware of your brazen act of corporate vandalism by the way those test subjects you killed They died in agony My scientists assure me they can recover the data you've destroyed You've succeeded in temporarily delaying our research Nothing more
[308:10.13]Phineas tells me your scientists are hopelessly lost.
[308:12.50]All your research is wrong.
[308:14.60]Your scientists are lying to you.
[308:16.36]Their research is critically flawed.
[308:18.04]Your scientists are lying.
[308:20.02]I wrecked that data.
[308:22.01]That experiment was badly engineered.
[308:23.47]I gotta talk about lies.
[308:24.99]We gotta keep the lies going.
[308:28.55]Your scientists are lying to you.
[308:29.97]Their research is critically flawed.
[308:36.09]I mean, it's- the research isn't- it was terrible, it was awful.
[308:38.91]Sure you're not surrounded by liars?
[308:41.82]Uh, you took the word of a bunch of corporate lab coats, and people say I'm slow.
[309:06.02]I don't know what pains me more.
[309:08.30]Realizing that I've been lied to or hearing the truth from an idiot like you.
[309:13.72]We're going to have to start all over again.
[309:16.16]All that research, all those experiments.
[309:19.16]You've sent us back decades.
[309:22.58]I don't see any reason to continue arguing with you.
[309:26.25]I know when I'm beaten.
[309:28.65]The only thing left to do is surrender.
[309:30.55]She's surrendering.
[309:31.49]Surrender.
[309:32.57]Congratulations, Captain.
[309:35.45]You've outplayed me.
[309:37.88]I accept your terms and will return Dr. Wells to your care.
[309:42.52]Thank you.
[309:43.72]Hurry up and leave before I change.
[309:45.04]Thank you.
[309:45.36]I'm glad we could settle this without violence.
[309:46.86]Drop the honorable adversary act and fuck off already.
[309:50.52]The fate of the colony is in your hands now.
[309:53.95]I bid you farewell, Captain.
[309:57.11]Thank you.
[309:57.45]Appreciate it.
[310:00.88]Let's go get the key.
[310:01.94]Wait, are you in that office?
[310:03.18]Hold on, were you talking to me from over there?
[310:11.37]Very cool.
[310:14.69]Any other people I can lie to?
[310:18.23]Wait, is something wrong with my gear?
[310:19.59]Oh, okay.
[310:20.48]Keep it on.
[310:20.86]I might have to lie.
[310:22.38]I might have to continue lying.
[310:42.23]Oh, that was cool.
[310:46.79]Hey.
[310:50.09]Phineas, I'm so glad to see you.
[310:55.02]How did we get you out of there?
[311:02.79]Come on out.
[311:13.66]You don't know how glad I am to see you.
[311:17.13]You must have said something to get under Akande's skin.
[311:19.93]She's gone and I don't think she's coming back.
[311:24.23]And you, you lunatic, you broke into the board's own fortress just to rescue one doddering old man.
[311:31.29]You are absolutely out of your mind and I can't begin to thank you enough.
[311:38.96]I mean, thank the people that just believe everything that anyone tells them.
[311:45.03]There is no perception checks or lie checks.
[311:49.57]Just tell people whatever they want.
[311:51.68]Everyone's so gullible.
[311:57.76]I could tell everybody in this game that the sky was not blue.
[312:00.90]That it was green.
[312:03.42]And they wouldn't even look up to confirm it.
[312:05.64]They would just go, green you say?
[312:07.50]Wow, that's interesting.
[312:08.63]Really green?
[312:09.75]Damn, I thought it was blue.
[312:11.65]Anyways, here's the key card.
[312:21.17]Oh yeah, the board never stood a chance against me.
[312:25.27]You know I wouldn't let anything happen to you, Phineas.
[312:26.87]Do you have any idea how much trouble I went to save you?
[312:29.03]What?
[312:29.59]Break into the most heavily guarded facility in the most hostile world in Halcyon?
[312:34.45]No, I have absolutely no idea how you did it.
[312:38.74]You're a goddamn miracle worker.
[312:41.52]You've broken the board's stranglehold on this colony, and you saved my life.
[312:46.42]But there's still so much we have yet to accomplish.
[312:50.51]You and I are going to have to work harder than ever to save Halcyon.
[312:55.07]I'm afraid the situation is far worse than any of us ever anticipated.
[312:59.42]I was just about to pop open some drinks to celebrate.
[313:05.42]I would like nothing more than to celebrate this victory, but we have a serious problem on our hands.
[313:12.28]Earth has gone dark.
[313:13.08]You literally walked through the game.
[313:14.52]We haven't received a single message in three years.
[313:17.20]There's been no communication, no signals, nothing.
[313:20.75]You've got a master liar here.
[313:48.31]Uh... We have a lot of work ahead of us.
[313:50.37]We better get started.
[314:17.66]Yes, we do.
[314:18.84]You've done a marvelous thing.
[314:20.60]You've succeeded where anyone else would have failed, including me.
[314:24.17]We must begin the revival process immediately, starting with the hopes of Brightest Minds, and then we're going to fix this damn colony, one problem at a time.
[314:33.97]Wait, what do you mean, starting with Brightest Minds?
[314:35.15]We're going to need a leader, and I can't imagine a better person for the job than you.
[314:40.40]What do you say, old friend?
[314:41.92]Will you help us?
[314:43.22]Wait, you want me to be CEO?
[314:45.87]I've got plans.
[314:47.22]With the chairman in my pocket, no one's going to know I'm running the colony.
[314:51.12]I'm going to run this colony myself.
[314:52.52]I've already convinced the chairman to take my side.
[314:57.32]You can count on me.
[314:58.53]I'll help you revive the other colonists.
[315:00.67]I'm going to do what I've always done.
[315:02.33]Whatever I want, all the time.
[315:04.79]Huh?
[315:05.55]Oh, sorry, I wasn't listening.
[315:06.77]I was thinking about getting some ice cream.
[315:10.22]I see.
[315:11.34]Well, you've certainly earned a treat for yourself.
[315:15.53]I'll just get on with reviving the other colonists and saving Halcyon then.
[315:20.54]Enjoy your creamed ice or whatever you call it.
[315:24.18]Chocolate.
[315:31.02]The OSI teaches that everything in the universe happens according to the grand plan.
[315:36.79]But the stranger that arrived in Halcyon was an unplanned variable.
[315:42.00]From the moment he landed in Emerald Vale, his actions altered the course of history.
[315:47.46]The events on Tartarus brought about the end of the board's authority.
[315:51.64]But the board's mistakes would haunt the colony for decades to come.
[315:56.22]The damage they left behind would require the work of a generation to repair.
[316:01.99]Dr. Phineas Wells began reviving a handful of the Hope's colonists.
[316:06.89]Engineers, scientists, technicians, and intellectuals.
[316:11.04]They were among the brightest minds the Earth had ever sent out into the stars.
[316:15.72]The Hope scientists and engineers woke up in a colony descending headlong into total collapse.
[316:22.61]With no way to return to Earth, they had no choice but to band together and devote themselves to the cause of saving Halcyon.
[316:31.11]Did we do it?
[316:32.21]The people of Halcyon were nothing if not hardy.
[316:35.89]In the absence of the board's authority,
[316:38.33]And why are we getting a PS4 dashboard add-on for the end of the game?
[316:41.31]In the years to come, Halcyon was forced to reckon with its newfound freedom.
[316:45.29]The board was gone.
[317:03.47]And for better or worse, the colony was responsible for its own destiny.
[317:09.41]Left unchecked, the war on Monarch consumed both MSI and the Iconoclasts.
[317:15.46]And when the sulfur clouds settled, only stragglers from both factions remained.
[317:21.68]Some found their way to Sublight.
[317:23.58]Some to Terra 2.
[317:25.78]And some lived their final years fighting for food in the wilderness.
[317:30.58]In the end,
[317:31.90]Only the beasts remained.
[317:34.52]Adelaide McDevitt replaced Reed Thompson as the leader of Edgewater.
[317:39.88]She and her followers transformed Edgewater in their image.
[317:44.22]Anyone loyal to Reed was pressured into leaving town.
[317:48.34]And those who stayed behind adapted to her way of life.
[317:51.92]Adelaide transformed the old cannery into a new garden.
[317:56.49]The nearby Edgewater Cemetery provided a convenient source of fertilizer.
[318:02.08]it was said that the first corpse that fed her garden belonged to reed thompson under the leadership of June lay tennyson it's not glitched this is what it is corporate influence the ship's mechanical stability gave June lay the time to educate a promising generation rewriting the history schooled in her family so um it's the ultimate lie the future of the groundbreaker books promising I'm just this is more line of the hope and the abandonment of the lifetime employment program
[318:31.35]forced Byzantium to come to terms with some uncomfortable realities about the state of Halcyon.
[318:37.98]While Byzantines were reluctant to surrender the luxuries they'd grown accustomed to, the board's diminished authority gave them little choice in the matter.
[318:47.82]Nearly everyone had to learn to make do with less.
[318:50.42]Some even had to get jobs.
[318:51.54]It was a dark time indeed.
[318:59.08]Ellie savored her adventures on the unreliable.
[319:02.79]Once they were done, she returned to life as usual, running missions of dubious legality, shunning respectable work, and living life to the fullest.
[319:14.58]Wait, we don't talk anymore?
[319:17.68]But she was always bad at keeping in touch.
[319:20.68]Okay.
[319:22.00]After all he'd seen and heard adventuring with you,
[319:25.52]the vicar maximilian de soto renounced his faith and joined the effort to rebuild the colony ironically he finally found the joy that had eluded him over the course of his life and realized that perhaps he was always meant to you made him give up god laborer after all he quickly dismissed the idea he ruined his life he left the crew of the unreliable little was hurt from her again
[319:51.99]She exchanged occasional messages with Ada, but they were light on details and grew increasingly infrequent.
[319:59.63]Months later, her name appeared on the manifest of a research vessel that vanished during an unexpected solar storm.
[320:07.69]As hard as she tried to drink them away, Nyoka's memories eventually overcame her.
[320:13.81]Traveling with a crew served as everybody's favorite character.
[320:18.29]I owe you found my favorite character I made her leave within 20 minutes and now she's dead most comfortable the deep end of a bottle and the far end of a trail Few have seen her since the travelers often swear they hear her and her machine gun in the night screaming swears and spitting bullets
[320:40.38]The SAM unit that accompanied you spread awareness of the product line's superior sanitation and maintenance capabilities across what was left of the colony.
[320:49.90]This led to a boost in... Sam's doing okay.
[320:53.67]Did you know that SAM units are the longest-lasting, toughest-acting cleaning solution in Halcyon?
[321:00.69]Minister Clark was released from house arrest, and his contact with you gave him a sense of renewed purpose and vigor.
[321:07.91]Once it became clear that no help would be coming from Earth, he threw his considerable efforts and talents into helping Halcyon manage the crisis.
[321:16.04]We just get like this epilogue of every person we've ever come across?
[321:19.32]Sophia Akande was the true power behind Chairman Rockwell.
[321:24.20]However, after the riots on Tartarus, she was never again seen in the colony.
[321:30.11]Various theories circulated as to her fate.
[321:33.70]Some believe she boarded an interstellar ship capable of journeying to a distant colony.
[321:39.44]Others believe she died trying to escape Tartarus.
[321:43.55]Some few suggest she fled to Monarch, where she continued to live among a small band of loyalists.
[321:49.05]And then there's me, the narrator of this story.
[321:51.79]It's me talking.
[321:56.99]public view, but continued supporting the colony in secret.
[322:01.12]When Dr. Wells began reviving the Hope's colonists, he found himself with a sudden windfall of additional supplies and resources, courtesy of an anonymous donor.
[322:12.55]It's Bugleberry.
[322:15.29]Never told a soul.
[322:17.57]Chairman Rockwell also...
[322:22.29]Whenever you needed strings pulled or a voice to sell a policy change, Rockwell was only too happy to oblige.
[322:29.05]Should have killed him.
[322:30.52]As for Dr. Phineas Wells, he spent his remaining years in his orbital lab.
[322:36.02]Though he was always haunted by the failures of his past, he was determined to make things right by building toward... What happens if you kill everybody?
[322:44.54]Do you even get an end of the game thing?
[322:47.37]...scientists and engineers than he first expected.
[322:50.05]thanks to the additional batch of chemicals you stole from the Ministry.
[322:54.66]Wells never forgot about the human lives that were lost in acquiring these chemicals.
[322:59.42]The revival project was hard and difficult work.
[323:03.19]But in the end, despite limited resources, over half the Hope's colonists were successfully revived.
[323:10.91]Even after Wells passed away, the Hope's scientists and engineers worked night and day to pull Halcyon from the brink of collapse.
[323:20.08]Their efforts continue to this day, which may be reason enough for optimism.
[323:26.04]Dr. Wells laid the groundwork for the project to save the colony, but he would never live to see the fruits of his labor.
[323:33.26]He passed away a few years later.
[323:35.78]His work was carried on by the scientists and engineers he revived.
[323:40.75]Life will never be the same in Halcyon.
[323:43.35]It is widely agreed that the colony has a chance of stabilizing within a generation.
[323:48.43]owing to the hard work and determination of the surviving colonists recovery is a distant goal and the path is long and uncertain but the people of halcyon carry on determined as ever and what about you the unplanned variable in the history of what happened to me you brought an end to the chaos on tartarus and left Dr. wells to save halcyon on his own
[324:15.87]You had more pressing matters to attend to.
[324:19.74]As you tasted your first scoop of Rizzo's partially emulsified, semi-frozen, milk-like dessert, you realized something.
[324:29.58]All your troubles, all your adventures, all your struggles and choices, they had all led to this single moment.
[324:39.49]And it was all worth it.
[324:42.56]That's a nice touch.
[324:43.08]I like that.
[324:43.52]What?
[324:43.70]No, now it's the end.
[325:13.12]Alright, moral of the story.
[325:16.46]Why be violent when you just lie?
[325:19.80]And make everybody believe things that aren't true.
[325:22.24]And save the world.
[325:40.61]Ice cream game.
[325:42.71]Give final score now.
[325:45.60]Um... I feel like... Alright.
[325:51.26]The game was fun.
[325:53.82]I thought it was an interesting game.
[325:55.30]I thought it was a fun game.
[325:56.38]I do.
[325:56.82]I think it was good.
[325:57.96]But... Uh... That main campaign... How many main story missions even were there?
[326:08.16]Like, eight?
[326:16.98]There weren't more than like seven or eight main story missions in the game.
[326:23.16]Maybe ten?
[326:23.88]Five?
[326:31.19]And the fact that the main sort of antagonist of the entire video game, they just sort of appear and almost like pretend like you should know who they are.
[326:43.11]One of which you only get to see on screen twice.
[326:52.45]You could have gone on a date with Pavarti.
[326:54.73]Oh, that's too bad.
[327:03.44]It was a 12 minute speedrun.
[327:11.18]If you go evil and corporate, you meet them earlier.
[327:13.42]Wasn't I corporate?
[327:14.76]Wasn't I doing stuff for corporate?
[327:21.89]Including the optional quest, he didn't really miss much.
[327:28.72]10% to everybody.
[327:30.36]MSI is not part of the board.
[327:31.72]Oh, right, right, right.
[327:33.92]I'm sure there's plenty of stuff that I didn't do.
[327:39.92]I did two runs of the game and there's barely a difference, and there's like three board quests.
[327:49.61]But even still, though...
[327:52.57]I feel like the, if you, if you just, oh, I'm gonna do the main, I didn't, I didn't, I felt like I dilly-dallied a lot.
[327:57.62]What is this, three, I was streaming two hours before the internet went down.
[328:03.04]So let's say, let's say just under six hours today.
[328:10.45]And then seven, six or seven hours yesterday, and then four.
[328:13.49]So like, 16, 17 hours in the game?
[328:14.59]15 hours in-game?
[328:24.25]I guess that's still pretty good.
[328:25.89]But I feel like I did other stuff too.
[328:28.94]I wasn't just doing story missions.
[328:36.12]15 to 25 is the average.
[328:37.55]Yeah.
[328:40.89]Took me about 30 hours to do everything.
[328:42.81]Okay.
[328:51.10]I did skip an optional planet.
[328:53.88]Yeah, that's probably true.
[328:55.66]But... It's hard to place it.
[329:01.62]It was... It was like a... It was like a... It's a 7-3?
[329:07.95]7-2?
[329:07.99]Something like that?
[329:22.09]It got maybe 0.2, 0.3 base points there because of the ice cream ending.
[329:33.49]It was good.
[329:35.17]Look, I wouldn't have played it and streamed the whole thing if I didn't think it was any fun.
[329:39.29]Maybe like a... 7-1.
[329:39.75]There you go.
[329:52.59]I wasn't a fan of the ending, but I was a liar.
[329:55.09]So like, I like lied to myself about, you know what I mean, in the first place.
[330:02.44]I said the same thing yesterday too.
[330:04.10]It was, I had an enjoyable experience in the video game.
[330:07.22]And not every video game has to be the best game you've ever played.
[330:09.36]So there's that too.
[330:18.19]I lie to myself every day.
[330:22.49]Would it have been as funny if you didn't go down the liar route?
[330:29.62]Maybe not, but you don't have... I mean, everybody that plays this game is going to play it a little differently.
[330:39.90]New Vegas now or... Whoa!
[330:44.60]I've ruined New Vegas for myself.
[330:45.92]I can't play it.
[330:48.06]I was being chased by like a hundred Easy Peets.
[330:51.22]I had the time gun.
[330:53.40]I can't play New Vegas again.
[330:55.46]I can't do it.
[331:01.61]I stepped way out of... I like pulled myself out of the universe and just made it a shitshow.
[331:15.78]But...
[331:18.41]New Vegas is overrated?
[331:19.63]I didn't say that.
[331:20.83]I thought it was good for the two about full streams I played it until I cheated.
[331:25.40]This is where it went very, very, very wrong.
[331:29.54]There was a point in New Vegas where I couldn't open a door.
[331:31.64]I remember explicitly where it was.
[331:33.98]It was in that bar with the there was a show going on behind the door and I didn't feel like going to get the key so I just no-clipped through the door.
[331:42.90]And that was it.
[331:43.46]It was over.
[331:44.12]Over at that point because then now you've ruined everything and you can do that everywhere.
[331:52.13]And then I... But... It don't matter.
[331:57.99]Anyways.
[332:02.20]Thank you for watching.
[332:03.88]That's gonna be the end of the stream.
[332:07.12]I know it looks like it's been a three and a half hour stream, but it's actually been about six.
[332:10.76]Because of the internet crashing halfway through.
[332:14.80]But... Thanks for watching.
[332:17.15]I'll see you guys in... Like three or four days.
[332:21.27]Probably on...
[332:24.27]either Monday or Tuesday.
[332:27.51]And we're probably going to just start Halo.
[332:29.93]Because that's when it comes out, right?
[332:32.39]I have, for those of you that don't know, I have a procedure coming up here.
[332:36.69]I have to do another endoscopy.
[332:38.65]And it's going to put me on drugs, it's going to fuck me up for a day or two, and I have to fast the night before.
[332:42.32]So this is going to be like two or three days where I'm just going to kind of be out of it.
[332:47.16]So.
[332:48.84]I have to do that.
[332:51.96]Hope you had a happy Thanksgiving, everybody that celebrates it.
[332:55.91]I will see you guys at the latest probably Tuesday.
[333:01.83]Either Monday or Tuesday is when you'll probably see me.
[333:04.20]Depends on how I feel after everything's done.
[333:10.88]He's kind of getting drugged.
[333:15.32]See you soon.
[333:17.89]We'll do the bits.
[333:18.47]We'll hang out for a little bit.
[333:21.43]Sorry about the whole thing crashing earlier.
[333:23.21]It was very strange.
[333:25.67]It's like the internet went down, but it didn't.
[333:28.38]It was very weird.
[333:30.62]But yeah.
[333:34.08]See you soon.
[333:44.52]Let's transition over here.
[333:54.78]Maybe it was a Twitch ingest problem?
[333:56.71]Maybe.
[333:57.13]That's very possible.
[334:03.53]Is this still broken?
[334:04.55]It always is.
[334:05.53]Yeah, it don't matter.
[334:08.63]It seems to reset itself after about two or three weeks.
[334:13.81]It then decides to pull from a stream from two weeks ago.
[334:18.67]Don't ask me why.
[334:21.06]Hey, ShittyViewBot, thanks for the 500 bits.
[334:22.80]I was just wondering if you ever played any of the Serious Sam games.
[334:26.94]You seem to have a lot of fun with Dusk, and the two games seem quite similar.
[334:30.76]I had a vision a few years ago.
[334:36.15]It was a weird dream that I had when me and Star played it.
[334:41.61]The whole thing.
[334:42.09]I made a video on it.
[334:46.35]I had this strange dream about it.
[334:52.38]Something about that.
[334:52.98]We were getting chased by crabs and stuff.
[334:57.24]It was really, really... It was fun, though.
[334:58.54]I remember playing the whole thing.
[334:59.36]It was fun.
[335:08.25]But... Yeah, I've thought about it.
[335:10.51]Serious Sam is interesting.
[335:11.45]Serious Sam is... A game that I always have glossed over.
[335:15.93]I don't know why.
[335:16.61]Just because it seems too chaotic...
[335:21.40]But it's not like I'm up against ever playing it.
[335:26.36]20 to 30 uploads in the future.
[335:36.79]It has come across my desk a few times.
[335:39.73]And I just go, maybe.
[335:40.62]Maybe.
[335:44.33]Pfft, okay.
[336:22.46]Quick, cut his mic.
[336:39.46]Alright, alright.
[336:40.28]Appreciate it.
[336:42.38]Happy Thanksgiving.
[336:43.10]Thank you.
[336:43.96]Thank you GM Igon for the 500 bits.
[336:47.50]You want wacky?
[336:48.36]Talk about the Star Wars Holiday Special.
[336:52.14]I've never seen that, you know.
[336:56.22]I feel like it's something I should have seen.
[337:02.83]I've heard it's wild.
[337:08.21]Thank you for the 500 bits, GM.
[337:09.97]Appreciate it.
[337:12.43]Hey, PissJuggin, thanks for the 300 bits.
[337:15.25]Thank you for streaming.
[337:16.01]I remember watching your uploads come out when... Oh?
[337:23.12]I remember watching your uploads come out when it kind of got cut off.
[337:29.85]Thank you, though.
[337:30.23]I appreciate it.
[337:31.53]Thanks for watching.
[337:33.95]Hey, SadVega, thanks for the $2.50.
[337:35.31]Speaking of collecting bits, happy Thanksgiving.
[337:37.09]Happy Thanksgiving.
[337:39.38]Hope you had a good one.
[337:43.06]Hey, AppleShift, thanks for the $2.50.
[337:46.11]Hey, since it's Thanksgiving, I wanted to let you know how thankful I am for you and this community.
[337:50.53]You're the most wonderful, inspiring, and dedicated streamer on Twitch.
[337:55.61]Damn, that's... that's a lot.
[337:58.80]And you came into my life at what feels like exactly the right time.
[338:02.62]Becoming friends with all the incredible people in the Discord has been an absolute blast, too.
[338:06.16]I'm genuinely happy in life right now, and you're the best person I could ever have to look up to when things get rough.
[338:13.22]Love you, have a great Thanksgiving.
[338:18.87]I'm really happy that you can find friends and people to hang out with and people that you can talk to and play games with and just hang out and call with.
[338:30.00]That's awesome.
[338:32.08]And if it has anything to do with me, then that's... I'm glad that that's sort of a catalyst there.
[338:39.89]Thank you so much for the 250 bits and for sticking around.
[338:49.85]Hope you had a great Thanksgiving.
[338:52.01]Thank you, Apple Shift.
[338:57.37]Thank you, The Plushie, for the 400 bits.
[338:59.06]Hey, Jerma, I may not be here when the stream ends, but I want to thank you in chat for the kind words the other night.
[339:04.00]Had a good time on your Discord the last night, and I'm going to try to see a therapist soon.
[339:11.63]That's very good news.
[339:18.86]Solid, solid, solid, solid stuff.
[339:25.18]I wish you the best.
[339:28.68]And again, I will say, do not be afraid of going to therapy.
[339:32.48]Do not be afraid of somebody trying to help you.
[339:40.28]I really appreciate it.
[339:41.62]Thanks for the 400 bits.
[339:44.10]Good luck to you.
[339:48.68]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[339:49.92]Happy Thanksgiving, Jerma Turkey.
[339:52.14]I'm extremely thankful for all the outstanding content you've consistently put out over the years as your career as an internet comedian, superstar, and millionaire.
[340:02.09]Thank you, appreciate that.
[340:05.29]Thanks for the 250 bits.
[340:08.89]Sign up with Facebook, thanks for the 250.
[340:12.17]A long time ago, I decided against having something like a PayPal setup.
[340:14.69]Because... PayPal is sort of weird, and... I remember hearing horror stories of people...
[340:43.83]sending a bunch of money and then they can charge it back.
[340:46.85]And if you've already transferred that money or accepted it or spent it or something, then it's like, wait, you have to give that money back.
[340:53.58]And it's like, wait, what?
[340:55.12]And it goes into like an appeal process.
[340:57.94]And I know people that still do it and well, just don't touch the money for 90 days.
[341:02.12]And it's like, well, okay, just let it sit.
[341:05.08]Should I just have like a big open pit of a PayPal account where I just don't touch it ever.
[341:10.46]And then I look at it every like four months to see what's in there.
[341:14.44]so it's just something if I was ever going to do anything like that I don't I just don't think I would just it's it's kind of too much for me to have to think about spoken like a true crypto backer
[341:44.02]just said a contradiction what was it what did I not convey the the thought did I go off what did I do I said I've charged backs and people sending money and then like four months later they can take it back and stuff right that's why that's why I don't do it if I ever did that I wouldn't oh right but that's me mid-thought changing gears and saying I'm not gonna do it
[342:14.47]There was talk a long time ago of a Patreon, but a Patreon is just subs, but on a different website.
[342:24.89]You know, hey, sign up for my Patreon.
[342:27.84]Hey, you subscribe.
[342:30.50]But there's a different website where you can subscribe again.
[342:32.96]It just didn't feel right.
[342:36.34]It felt sort of like didn't feel, didn't click.
[342:40.44]But you'll get more money.
[342:44.30]Yeah, but I would rather take a sponsorship or something than try to double dip you guys.
[342:52.44]You know what I mean?
[342:55.47]Like, hey, give me $5 a month on Twitch.
[342:57.63]Alright.
[342:58.15]Cool.
[342:58.39]Thanks a lot.
[342:58.87]Hey, you know, I got a Patreon $5 a month over there too.
[343:01.29]Alright, I guess.
[343:04.69]But you already... You already are doing that.
[343:12.77]Just make it as a tip jar?
[343:16.59]maybe I just have no goals or reward tiers or anything I guess maybe it would just be there bits are a tip jar yeah I know but I'm just saying having bits and subs and then having a Patreon is like you're asking the same people that are potentially giving money already to do it again
[343:43.89]Which I would rather, instead of tapping into you guys again for a separate website to pay money to... I would rather just... I would do a sponsorship before that.
[344:06.62]He hates taking our money.
[344:08.36]Pepe hands.
[344:12.81]You need at least 10 different sources of revenue.
[344:21.98]No, I don't need 10 sources of revenue.
[344:28.47]But yeah, I guess that's the long answer to why I don't have a donation set up.
[344:39.77]I don't know.
[344:41.01]That's kind of the thought process.
[344:42.27]But, thank you for the $2.50.
[344:44.57]Sign up with Facebook.
[344:45.43]I appreciate it.
[344:48.39]C4G, thanks for the $2.50.
[344:49.93]RPG Ayaya.
[344:51.52]Clap.
[344:51.96]Cute chat.
[344:52.78]Rise up.
[344:53.62]RPG Ayaya.
[344:55.00]Clap.
[345:09.18]Thank you.
[345:09.66]Thank you, Trampston, for the 500 bits.
[345:12.18]Love you and your stream, JermJerm.
[345:13.52]If this screen weren't between the two of us, I would pop through and kiss you on the forehead.
[345:20.21]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[345:21.41]I'm glad that's not possible.
[345:22.67]Because not only that would be a little strange, but also that would mean that people could reach through and strangle me.
[345:34.56]So I'm glad that's not a capable technology at the moment.
[345:44.64]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[345:50.66]Let's get the credits rolling.
[345:53.80]Move over to the other screen.
[345:55.66]Oops, sorry, I bumped you.
[345:59.16]Thanks, everybody, for subbing.
[346:05.02]The credits, unfortunately, have been killed.
[346:09.02]Because of the disconnect that I had like two hours, three hours ago.
[346:14.05]So this is going nice and slow this time.
[346:21.40]Slow credits, PepeHands.
[346:31.20]Wait, this is old?
[346:33.94]Trotter was there yesterday.
[346:39.05]Is this old?
[346:39.53]It can't be.
[346:43.51]Scroll it faster scroll it faster.
[346:46.34]Hey, that's me.
[346:47.10]That's you that's you Read them I Can't read them because if I read them then it's not fair to the people like I deleted two hours ago And they're gonna be like what hey?
[347:03.91]Alright, I'll name.
[347:04.43]I'll do I'll do two
[347:21.21]Thank you, Zombie Slapper 2.
[347:26.67]Thank you, Ampere Mari 2.
[347:29.26]That's it.
[347:49.10]Sorry to everybody whose subs the first few hours got cut off.
[347:52.60]I don't know what the fuck happened.
[347:53.72]It makes no sense.
[347:55.60]But you do what you gotta do.
[348:01.17]We have a few more bits to do.
[348:03.91]We have Convo Breaker, thanks to the 250.
[348:07.10]If anyone does not believe in the power of Jerma One Guy, it's just because you haven't had a moment yet.
[348:11.82]I've had more One Guy moments than I could type here before the character limit, mostly because of my four years of watching.
[348:18.88]New sub-badge is when.
[348:20.70]And these bits are a small tribute for those.
[348:23.76]I'll always cherish how me mentioning your companion looking like a dentist caused you to, four hours later, Google dentists take the Hippocratic Oath to stay in character and any others to come.
[348:41.44]Never underestimate the power of the one guy.
[348:45.51]It is immensely powerful.
[348:55.31]It's insanely powerful.
[349:00.80]I wish I was the one guy Pepe hands.
[349:03.18]You are now.
[349:07.44]You are now.
[349:19.40]I was about to mod that person, but that would be bad, so I deleted it.
[349:23.48]I modded you in spirit in my mind.
[349:34.36]Guys, all it takes is to slash mod, and then all of a sudden, that person just has to copy and paste a bunch of commands they might have saved, and delete everything I've ever worked on.
[349:48.80]They could, like, delete every Nightbot command, they could delete every VOD, I don't know, I'm scared.
[349:54.90]I almost had so much power.
[349:56.52]You did, for a few seconds.
[350:09.41]So close, so close.
[350:11.61]But thank you, Convobreaker.
[350:12.67]Appreciate it.
[350:13.97]Thank you, Clowers!
[350:16.22]Clowers B for the 250 bits.
[350:19.43]Had a dream about you a couple days ago.
[350:21.09]It was just you streaming something and at some point you lost your dog and then you banned me.
[350:27.11]Why does everyone else get cool Jerma dreams and you ban me?
[350:30.15]Please unban me.
[350:35.55]But what happened to my dog?
[350:37.63]Did I think that you took my dog?
[350:40.38]Give my dog back and maybe you'll get unbanned.
[350:49.18]Ban him again, but in real life.
[350:57.22]Guys, where's my dog?
[351:00.61]Where's Otto?
[351:02.33]What the fuck happened?
[351:03.33]Where's my dog?
[351:13.16]Hold on, I have something really important.
[351:14.30]I was about to do, like, I'm gonna ban the ban, uh, Clowers joke.
[351:19.40]But, um, if you ban somebody, doesn't it, like, remove a bunch of stuff from what they may have done on this channel?
[351:27.12]Well, it'll, like, it'll, like, fuck a bunch of stuff up, right?
[351:36.94]I feel like I don't want to do that, mate.
[351:37.96]I don't want to, like, delete.
[351:39.48]I just, like, swallowed hard.
[351:46.99]Nah, I'm not gonna risk it.
[351:47.89]But anyways, pretend I banned you, Flowers.
[351:49.45]That's a weird dream.
[351:50.89]Hey, Bobo Dorago, thanks for the 500 bits.
[351:55.57]Hey, Jerma, love the streams.
[351:56.55]You're the first streamer I've ever donated to and watched.
[351:59.77]I just hit 3k subs on my YouTube where I upload old music.
[352:04.26]And advice for playing the YouTube game?
[352:06.34]Interested to hear what people like when they listen to my music.
[352:09.26]Unfortunately, my advice for the YouTube game is...
[352:13.26]I actually don't really... I actually don't really like YouTube.
[352:16.40]I'm like a... I'm like a YouTube... I'm an anti-YouTube.
[352:27.03]But that was back when I was on YouTube.
[352:29.59]He's an... He's an anti-Tuber.
[352:36.54]I actually cannot give advice about YouTube.
[352:40.30]For one reason.
[352:41.10]Because when I was active on YouTube...
[352:43.83]was four plus five maybe years ago.
[352:47.81]So the advice that I would give somebody is like five-year-old advice.
[352:51.43]It's like watching patch notes from a game that you currently play when the game was in beta three years ago.
[353:04.49]So I feel like some of the stuff I would say might not be accurate anymore.
[353:11.09]But
[353:14.80]Uh... Listen to my music.
[353:22.34]Here, we'll just... Here you go.
[353:23.44]If you want to listen to music, take a look at that.
[353:29.39]Alright, I'm gonna give you... I'll give you three seconds.

[356:03.82]Jerma, thanks for all the good streams.
[356:04.88]I remember coming back home from middle school watching your TF2 videos to now about to graduate college.
[356:11.70]Even though your career peaked at shpi, I've been watching you all the way.
[356:17.33]Don't really know what I'm going to do after college.
[356:19.21]Here's my first donation before I go out into the real world and become homeless.
[356:22.69]Thanks for all the good streams.
[356:23.79]Jerma Hart.
[356:26.97]I don't think I don't believe I peaked at shpi, but...
[356:31.72]about to graduate college, you're closing a book, you're about to open a new one.
[356:37.85]And here's the best part.
[356:39.55]The best part about graduating college is you've been reading books that other people have written.
[356:46.19]After college, you get to write your own.
[356:50.70]I hope it's a good one.
[357:02.64]Thank you.
[357:06.14]Hey, and finally, we got Jack the Mac for the 500 bits.
[357:08.86]Hey, Jerma, thanks for playing Dusk last week.
[357:11.26]Loved that game, and it deserves the exposing you gave it.
[357:13.25]That game's fantastic.
[357:16.11]I can't wait to play AMID EVIL by the same publisher.
[357:20.77]Looks just as interesting.
[357:30.43]Should be cool.
[357:33.03]What would have happened to that book Jeremy said he was going to write?
[357:35.85]Books are hard to write.
[357:37.45]I gave up after about 17 pages.
[357:52.70]I think, yeah, I copy and pasted random blurbs.
[357:57.00]I was just copying and pasting random pages like two years ago.
[358:00.44]Somebody in here definitely has some of them.
[358:03.54]I just was pasting them into this chat.
[358:11.68]But... Happy Thanksgiving.
[358:13.96]Hope you had a good one.
[358:15.00]Thanks everybody again for your support.
[358:18.51]Wish me luck.

[358:26.31]And... Gotta do it, right?
