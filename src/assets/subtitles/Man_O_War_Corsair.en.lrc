[01:50.38]Hi.
[01:51.70]I'm back.
[01:53.46]Well, not back.
[01:54.28]I'm not back.
[01:54.76]I didn't even go anywhere.
[01:56.05]I just started.
[01:57.39]I'm here now.
[02:03.27]Crunchy.
[02:06.09]This better last 20 minutes.
[02:07.35]No, this game actually looks kind of fun.
[02:10.31]This game actually looks pretty good.
[02:17.26]If I will say so myself.
[02:24.50]Guess who's back with a brand new track?
[02:26.28]It's me.
[02:26.66]Let's drop the volume just a little bit.
[02:36.49]Just a little bit.
[02:39.21]And there it is.
[02:44.85]Hold on.
[02:48.31]Oh, shit.
[02:51.09]There it is.
[02:55.10]There it is.
[02:55.68]There it is.
[02:56.16]There it is.
[02:56.64]Okay.
[03:02.38]Okay.
[03:05.14]Let me close my window so when I eventually scream, my neighbor doesn't think I'm actually being attacked.
[03:14.73]So give me one second.
[03:19.71]Closing the window.
[03:23.00]It's closed.
[03:27.66]Okay.
[03:29.56]Otto, come here.
[03:31.41]Hey, come lie down, Otto.
[03:36.87]Yeah, this game is called Corsair.
[03:39.55]Manowar Corsair.
[03:40.63]It's by the Games Workshop people.
[03:42.91]It flew under the radar for me.
[03:45.60]I did not even know this existed.
[03:47.02]But it's a, like, open world pirate game.
[03:50.98]Let's hope it's not Raven's Cry 2.
[03:57.17]So without further ado, we're going to play.
[04:02.75]I just found out this is not multiplayer.
[04:05.25]I think I talked about like, oh, Talix, me and Talix can play this game or something.
[04:08.29]No, this game is not multiplayer.
[04:10.37]It's just what you see is what you get single player.
[04:13.45]It's still in early access.
[04:14.65]I think it comes out of early access in like a month or two.
[04:19.58]I think according to what they want to do with the game.
[04:23.17]It looked fun.
[04:23.75]It looked interesting.
[04:24.59]It might be funny.
[04:25.71]I don't know.
[04:26.51]We're going in blind.
[04:28.69]It's got positive ratings.
[04:30.23]It's got positive ratings.
[04:37.59]There's nobody to destroy, Rhomba.
[04:40.95]I will eventually, though.
[04:41.81]Don't worry.
[04:43.39]Rhomba Ty.
[04:44.63]Or Rhomba TV.
[04:45.49]Rhomba Ty.
[04:47.19]Rhomba TV.
[04:48.47]Welcome.
[04:48.79]Thank you.
[04:50.79]Welcome to the family.
[04:53.07]Yeah, that's an orc.
[04:55.13]You would call that a pirate orc.
[04:56.82]Yes.
[04:58.24]And there's a guy with a huge Santa Claus beard.
[05:02.52]We're already going places.
[05:07.18]That legit is an asset from a Santa Claus, isn't it?
[05:10.11]It has to be.
[05:10.97]Now we're just going to wait for people to trickle in.
[05:16.29]Give it like another minute or two.
[05:19.90]Is that guy holding a sausage?
[05:21.10]No, that's a goon.
[05:23.16]It's smoking.
[05:32.46]This dude doesn't have a beard.
[05:34.37]He could, though.
[05:35.01]He has a five o'clock shadow.
[05:39.27]I don't know what this guy's pointing at.
[05:41.61]This guy's posing for the picture.
[05:44.18]See, this guy is about to swing and smash my head in.
[05:46.90]I'm assuming this is the main character.
[05:48.62]He's shooting in the distance.
[05:49.73]He's shooting in the distance.
[05:51.11]These people are like, oh, man in the back!
[05:52.91]Take the field!
[05:54.13]This guy is posing for the picture.
[05:57.07]He's the only person that's not actively... This guy kind of, too.
[05:59.53]This guy's not really working that hard, I guess.
[06:03.31]Listen to me, son!
[06:05.96]Hey, look at my gun pose.
[06:08.22]Destroy him!
[06:12.55]The Morning Frost.
[06:13.57]Welcome, Morning Frost.
[06:14.65]Thank you for your subscription.
[06:15.63]I thought the orc was on your team.
[06:19.63]He might be, but what's with all this blood?
[06:23.23]There's a lot of blood on that knife.
[06:26.71]Oh, he's on the wheel.
[06:27.27]Oh, yeah, he's driving the ship.
[06:28.33]You're right.
[06:31.69]All right.
[06:32.93]I think we can begin.
[06:34.97]Thank you to those two that just subscribed.
[06:38.07]And we'll start the campaign.
[06:38.99]It is single-player only.
[06:43.01]Is it Mr. Calzone?
[06:45.29]Oh, no.
[06:50.09]Cologne?
[06:51.33]Cologne.
[06:52.35]Oh, good.
[06:53.96]It's like aerobatic cologne.
[06:57.02]Colonel Zaff, not cologne.
[06:58.92]El Zaff.
[07:01.18]Thanks.
[07:01.90]I'm going to keep calling you cologne.
[07:03.70]That's going to keep happening.
[07:06.52]Turn on subtitles.
[07:07.46]Can I?
[07:07.70]Let's see.
[07:10.65]Disable sea monsters.
[07:12.03]No, we're keeping sea monsters on.
[07:14.13]Sorry.
[07:16.49]Subtitles.
[07:18.11]I'm not sure there's much in the game of... Maybe there is.
[07:24.38]Controls.
[07:27.50]I don't think there's much in the game that revolves around that.
[07:35.32]This is vignette.
[07:38.16]I don't want vignette.
[07:39.53]I don't want depth of field either.
[07:44.19]Audio no, I don't know I there's no like subtitles Yeah, why would you ever disable sea monsters that's a really good question all right, let's go new game I'm gonna make my captain Captain Jameson Early access game this feature is not currently enabled, but will be included in a future update
[08:10.82]Jerma, you left your fucking tomato ointment here?
[08:23.03]Well, thank the both of you.
[08:24.73]Thank you Jerma's tomato sauce, mom.
[08:27.35]I'm sorry I left my tomato sauce there.
[08:28.94]And Johnnyboy7781, welcome to the family.
[08:33.97]Looks like it can be male or female.
[08:35.71]But I can't choose my nationality.
[08:37.19]I guess it's not in the game yet.
[08:39.25]Oh, early access.
[08:40.10]Oh, look at this.
[08:41.50]Early access trash.
[08:44.30]No, kidding.
[08:45.68]Captain, uh... What's my captain's name?
[08:52.54]How about, uh... Captain Googles.
[08:55.68]No.
[08:57.94]Captain Frankenstein.
[09:00.28]Captain Frankenstein.
[09:02.20]No.
[09:02.38]No.
[09:05.28]Captain, uh... This is important.
[09:12.04]Captain Humphreys?
[09:13.46]No, that's too... Captain Big Beard.
[09:19.73]Captain Santa Beard.
[09:21.69]Santa Beard.
[09:22.75]Captain Santa Beard.
[09:23.81]There you go.
[09:26.60]I have to have a Santa Beard.
[09:30.74]I can't put a beard on him?
[09:33.58]Why can't I put a beard on him?
[09:35.90]Select a description of your captain's life so far.
[09:38.52]Rich.
[09:40.28]Should I just be wicked rich?
[09:43.34]Alright, we'll see what rich.
[09:45.05]The ease one has as a rich nobleman in the old world's trade capital, Marienburg, weighed heavily upon you.
[09:51.73]Liquidating your assets and purchasing a ship and crew was unprecedented and caused no small amount of scandal amongst your peers.
[09:58.59]However, you've no doubt that this is the right decision.
[10:01.98]Okay, freedom is at your fingertips with... Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're ready to set sail into a new world.
[10:07.18]Yeah, damaged ship areas will be restored to a minimum of 50% health upon docking for free.
[10:15.31]I mean, what kind of should just do that, right?
[10:17.71]What's regular?
[10:20.09]What's a Dunkin' Donuts regular?
[10:21.77]I'm your dad!
[10:24.20]Destroy him!
[10:26.88]Whoa!
[10:27.64]Whoa!
[10:29.08]Mighty Baseplate, thanks for subbing.
[10:30.74]Welcome, dude.
[10:31.32]Now we pick our class, I guess.
[10:35.44]Damage ship area.
[10:36.22]So it just makes the game easier.
[10:38.54]All this just says is I'm a regular guy.
[10:40.60]Do you get any perks of being poor?
[10:45.03]I should just do easy peat mode.
[10:47.55]We're doing easy.
[10:49.11]I should do easy or normal.
[10:52.47]I feel like I'm going to regret not being rich.
[10:56.31]Why would you not pick rich?
[10:59.90]Does this make, like, the enemies easy, too?
[11:01.82]No, we're gonna go with just regular.
[11:02.88]We're gonna get a fucking Dunkin' Donuts regular.
[11:04.64]We're gonna get two creams and two sugars.
[11:12.19]Easy.
[11:14.87]No, I'm not doing it.
[11:16.21]Easy is the baby mode, right?
[11:17.95]It's always the baby mode.
[11:19.33]I don't want to do easy.
[11:22.06]But welcome back.
[11:23.80]Masco.
[11:25.46]I'm so bad at reading names.
[11:27.90]Mascot Rich for two months.
[11:30.39]And then Darth Buttcrust with the seven months.
[11:32.35]Thanks a lot, both of you guys.
[11:34.53]You're not good enough for normal.
[11:35.71]Well, I'll prove you wrong.
[11:36.57]We'll do it normal.
[11:38.73]My ship name.
[11:40.79]It was called The Revenge.
[11:41.83]And I get to pick the flag, too.
[11:43.43]The Mastodon.
[11:46.55]And it's gonna be...
[11:51.27]The skull, no.
[11:52.89]The fucking crab claw.
[11:54.91]Yep.
[11:56.17]The mastodon, and it's gonna be like the peeled off crab claw.
[12:01.95]Perfect.
[12:07.44]How's the headache?
[12:08.14]It's better.
[12:08.52]Is that... Hold on.
[12:12.64]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12:17.28]No, I don't care about anything else.
[12:20.46]I don't want like the fucking dollar bill.
[12:25.48]Yeah, we're definitely going with the crab bird face.
[12:32.11]Yes, that's fine.
[12:34.59]I'm your dad.
[12:37.01]Destroy him!
[12:41.42]Cornstalkhand77, thank you, Cornstalk, for your subscription.
[12:47.32]I guess we're starting the game.
[12:49.80]And here we go!
[12:52.26]Loading, please wait.
[12:53.93]Loading, please wait.
[12:59.07]Okay.
[13:03.23]Let's go.
[13:06.01]Oh boy.
[13:07.29]Your vessel, the Mastodon.
[13:10.95]On route to the port of Norden.
[13:15.91]Alright.
[13:18.07]How do I drive it?
[13:21.19]Captain's pick.
[13:21.85]Orcs.
[13:22.03]So there is subtitles.
[13:23.87]Whoa.
[13:40.71]What the fuck was that?
[13:42.95]Look around.
[13:43.53]Oh, well, my sens- this sensitivity.
[13:45.03]Hold on.
[13:45.43]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[13:46.19]Easy, easy game.
[13:47.03]Hold on.
[13:49.96]Easy game.
[13:52.42]It's just giving me a lot of information really quick.
[13:55.98]What am I looking at?
[13:58.40]Jesus, there's so much information going on.
[14:01.87]We're gonna get- we're gonna get- if I can- Oh my god!
[14:06.09]Adjust range?
[14:07.01]Okay.
[14:10.24]There it is.
[14:11.64]And then I can fire.
[14:15.34]Got him.
[14:15.66]Hold on.
[14:19.54]Hold on.
[14:22.49]My guy is so calm right now.
[14:24.85]He's just like, yeah, I guess.
[14:26.01]Fuck, I missed every shot.
[14:30.83]Right there.
[14:32.09]Boom.
[14:32.81]Hit him.
[14:35.84]How much health does he have?
[14:37.94]They're just throwing rocks.
[14:39.80]These guys don't even have cannons.
[14:42.78]They're shooting giant rocks at us.
[14:46.76]Hold on.
[14:48.08]Captain Santa beard.
[14:49.62]He's just like peering over the edge.
[14:52.11]Yeah, I can see them.
[14:53.27]We can all see them.
[14:55.81]He's done, right?
[14:57.45]Yeah, get sunk.
[14:59.39]Get sunk.
[15:02.37]Is he sunk?
[15:04.50]Yeah.
[15:05.56]Easy.
[15:05.70]Easy.
[15:07.80]Whoa!
[15:08.72]What the fuck?
[15:10.76]Oh, God.
[15:12.18]Oh, my God.
[15:13.02]Oh, my God.
[15:13.40]Okay.
[15:15.72]This is insane.
[15:16.42]I didn't think this was gonna happen.
[15:19.28]Holy shit, they're, like, destroying the boat.
[15:24.29]How do I get over there?
[15:25.55]What is this guy doing?
[15:29.75]Oh, my God.
[15:30.59]This is crazy.
[15:36.24]We can board their ship?
[15:39.94]How do I get off of aim mode?
[15:44.70]They're like parkouring.
[15:46.38]Get me out of aim mode!
[15:51.05]We did it!
[15:51.43]Alright, that was pretty cool.
[15:54.27]Not gonna lie.
[15:57.97]That was actually pretty awesome.
[16:00.05]But like a dumb tutorial.
[16:05.10]Woah, watch out for that!
[16:07.46]Nope, I'm not in a good spot.
[16:09.68]I'm gonna go for a long-range shot.
[16:11.01]That's a little, like, dingy.
[16:14.31]That's not gonna hit anything.
[16:17.13]Oof.
[16:21.20]Hold the right mouse button or move the mouse to adjust your aiming distance.
[16:23.78]Ah, okay, I can actually do... I don't have to do that.
[16:25.86]Okay, that makes sense.
[16:27.96]Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[16:32.35]Got him a couple times.
[16:36.08]This is a real pirate game, guys.
[16:38.92]From what I just played, this seems to be a pirate game.
[16:43.53]You can actually board the ships.
[16:45.03]Fame increase.
[16:45.63]I'm famous.
[16:47.89]He's done.
[16:49.29]One more ship right here.
[16:54.07]Long range.
[16:54.63]Nice.
[16:55.45]Got him.
[16:57.09]And I got buddies hitting him, too.
[16:59.49]Get your little fucking dinghy.
[17:00.75]Hey, quit playing with your dinghy.
[17:08.46]Did you pirate this game?
[17:09.92]No.
[17:10.72]It's on Steam Early Access right now.
[17:15.49]Almost done with the tutorial.
[17:18.71]I can't wait to just go start slashing people and boarding boats and looting and pillaging.
[17:24.03]It'll be so much fun.
[17:27.72]What if I just crash into him?
[17:28.70]I think I'm aiming too far.
[17:32.40]There we go.
[17:33.92]See you later.
[17:39.16]See you later.
[17:41.30]Is this a sponsored stream?
[17:42.46]No, it is not.
[17:49.59]Best sailing speed, ship speed, wind source?
[17:54.89]So I need to have... Okay, so the wind needs to be at our back.
[17:59.67]So right now we're against the wind.
[18:03.21]Let me do something here.
[18:04.05]I want to turn it up.
[18:05.13]Let's turn the audio up a little.
[18:12.94]Be a little louder.
[18:13.62]There we go.
[18:20.85]Turn the ships.
[18:26.61]Turn... return to Norden.
[18:28.41]Let's go full speed ahead boys.
[18:35.46]Does it say times one on the bottom?
[18:37.78]That's our destination.
[18:38.82]I can see it with my looking glass.
[18:44.79]This tower's here.
[18:45.55]Can you get like invaded or something?
[18:49.72]Damn.
[18:51.96]This might be really fun.
[18:57.16]Oh, shit.
[18:57.60]Okay, you can actually shoot.
[19:00.27]What if I just unload on the harbor?
[19:02.09]Am I gonna get in trouble?
[19:06.39]No, this is... I can't... I gotta get out of this tutorial.
[19:11.01]I could just fire on these guys, though.
[19:14.11]No, no, no, no.
[19:15.09]We're gonna be good.
[19:15.79]We're gonna be good boys.
[19:20.09]We're gonna go right to the port.
[19:23.81]T and Colin, thanks for five months.
[19:25.34]They say, I fucking love you, Jeremy.
[19:27.80]Keep it up.
[19:28.50]Proud of you.
[19:30.34]Thank you.
[19:32.88]Is there a certain dock I need to go into?
[19:34.14]Or do I just have to drive up to the little dude itself?
[19:42.90]Is there like a save?
[19:43.74]Yeah, let's make sure I save it.
[19:48.70]Let's go.
[19:51.04]Is this like this?
[19:58.89]Hey, munchies.com.
[20:00.21]Alright, good.
[20:04.57]Thanks, munchies.com.
[20:05.81]Munchies.com!
[20:07.75]Welcome.
[20:07.99]Thanks for subbing.
[20:08.91]Excellent work on those orcs, Captain Santa Bee.
[20:11.31]I forgot that was my name.
[20:12.33]I thought that was his actual name.
[20:14.49]As a thank you, take this gold.
[20:16.25]If you'd ever need further employment, pay me a visit.
[20:18.31]I may be able to help you in your endeavors.
[20:20.63]I've also instructed the shipwrights to mend any damage to your vessel.
[20:25.22]Well, thanks.
[20:25.70]These waters have gotten dangerous.
[20:27.90]We need some more firepower.
[20:29.18]A good sharpshooter wouldn't go amiss.
[20:32.44]Received 7,000 gold crowns.
[20:36.83]Alright, docks.
[20:38.73]Additional crew members may be hired while docked in a port to recruit a skilled rifleman.
[20:43.12]Visit the local docks or shipyard.
[20:45.30]Click recruit crew and find a sharpshooter.
[20:49.48]Recruit crew.
[20:52.66]5,000.
[20:55.14]Why can't I just hire like a couple of shit bums and just hand him a rifle?
[20:57.88]That's like almost all the money he gave me.
[21:02.79]Better make sure we got a full crew.
[21:04.19]Okay, I need like one more shit bum.
[21:05.85]Alright.
[21:08.45]Need some goods if we're gonna get trading.
[21:10.73]Oh, you can trade in this game?
[21:13.91]Marketplace might be viewed while at the dock port.
[21:15.45]So, like, mark it while in the port and see the goods available to be bought and sold.
[21:22.87]Okay.
[21:23.95]Yeah, what?
[21:25.87]I'm trying to... I'm learning.
[21:27.65]Rock'em, sock'em.
[21:28.79]Thanks for four months.
[21:29.85]They said pretty good.
[21:30.69]Yeah, it's pretty good.
[21:33.94]Oh, jeez.
[21:36.58]Norden is known for getting big harvests of fish from the Drossel's... I can't... Drossel's Pule... Drossel's Pule Bay.
[21:45.18]Last I heard, we could sell it at a good price in Ehrengrad, so you buy low and sell high, right?
[21:52.78]Purchase 10 crates of food, so I need 10 crates of food, 500 gold.
[21:56.10]I'll have the lad stow it in the hold.
[21:59.16]The mastodon will be set to sail on your word, Captain.
[22:01.88]Okay.
[22:02.10]Okay.
[22:05.38]So I can't really do it.
[22:07.26]This is just tutorial part two.
[22:10.98]First of all, I need to... Hold on.
[22:16.81]There's no... Is there controls?
[22:19.87]Sensitivity.
[22:20.51]Mouse look sensitivity.
[22:21.69]Yeah, we gotta bring this down.
[22:31.08]I'm missing important tutorials here.
[22:33.42]This map shows you the ports of every nation in the old world.
[22:36.02]Once we start visiting them, we can find out what the goods are trading and how much we can buy and sell them for.
[22:42.99]What map are they talking about?
[22:45.31]Oh, okay, M. Oh, Jesus.
[22:52.43]There's a shitload of places to go.
[22:57.92]Okay, well, now switch characters?
[23:04.07]Oh, I can beat anybody on the crew?
[23:07.79]Okay, this is cool.
[23:10.73]Do I have, like, a sword, or do I just have a gun?
[23:12.37]Oh, this is a rifleman.
[23:16.43]This is the rifleman.
[23:17.81]Am I going after this ship?
[23:19.61]This is fucking awesome.
[23:21.59]This is awesome.
[23:22.87]Okay, hold on.
[23:23.27]I don't want to, like, drive into a wall.
[23:26.63]Sail to the Eringrad.
[23:27.55]Sail to the Eringrad and sell the food.
[23:28.83]Okay.
[23:33.68]I'm assuming actual time.
[23:35.90]You can increase the speed of the day.
[23:38.52]So if I hit... Equal sign.
[23:44.48]Yeah, this is times two speed, times three speed.
[23:48.62]We're at times four speed right now.
[23:51.22]Times four, I guess, is the maximum.
[23:55.58]If you find you need to sail upwind, try tacking turn left.
[23:58.82]Yeah, you want to sail with the wind.
[24:02.89]Alright, we're going maximum time speed right now.
[24:08.97]Slow down a little bit.
[24:09.89]Now, wasn't there a way I could zoom in and zoom out?
[24:15.02]What the fuck is that?
[24:17.28]Holy... Holy shit.
[24:19.16]Holy... Oh my god.
[24:20.43]Get a gun!
[24:21.13]Get a gun!
[24:24.69]Whoa!
[24:28.92]It's a giant fucking... It's a giant shark.
[24:31.46]It's jaws.
[24:33.00]Oh my god.
[24:38.04]Do something.
[24:39.08]Dude, no.
[24:39.36]Get back on the boat.
[24:39.84]Get back on the boat.
[24:40.32]Get back on the boat.
[24:41.82]Get on the boat.
[24:43.02]Get on the boat and steer it.
[24:45.17]Steer it.
[24:45.65]Get on the boat.
[24:50.15]I want to shoot it with the cannons.
[24:55.70]Oh my god, that's terrifying.
[24:58.24]How do I get back on the boat?
[25:01.02]That scared the absolute shit out of me.
[25:08.06]Where'd he go?
[25:11.84]My god.
[25:14.08]I did not expect this to turn into a Universal Studios ride.
[25:20.53]Where is he?
[25:24.25]Where is he?
[25:24.59]Where is he?
[25:24.85]Where is he?
[25:28.55]I'm actually terrified right now.
[25:30.13]This is terrifying.
[25:31.08]I'm so close to dead.
[25:35.94]I have to kill the Megalodon.
[25:38.82]He's gonna jump up and eat the boat!
[25:42.17]Where is he?
[25:44.59]There he is!
[25:45.19]There he is!
[25:46.47]Turret, turret, turret!
[25:47.49]Shoot him!
[25:49.95]Hold on!
[25:50.25]Get him!
[25:51.95]Oh, shit!
[25:53.85]I've missed every shot.
[25:56.16]Sharp-shoot him.
[25:59.99]Where is it?
[26:00.23]I don't even know what side of the boat it was on.
[26:08.90]Where is that shark?
[26:11.10]There it is.
[26:16.50]Am I even shooting him?
[26:18.65]I feel like I'm not doing any damage.
[26:20.27]Jesus!
[26:28.68]Please, look at the damage this is doing!
[26:30.26]It's doing nothing!
[26:32.31]This is so loud!
[26:33.71]I gotta shoot him, like, in the face!
[26:38.75]This is gonna destroy them both.
[26:46.08]This is so fucking loud.
[26:48.12]I'm so sorry.
[26:54.04]Shoot him in the eye!
[26:56.81]Open up, come on!
[26:58.27]Moby Dick!
[26:59.81]I'll take you out with my battle tanks!
[27:01.56]Does he want me to shoot him with a fin?
[27:09.72]Why do you want me to shoot him?
[27:11.12]Can I just get back on the- I wanna like get back to steer the boat and like shoot him.
[27:22.85]We're dead.
[27:25.32]Abandon ship.
[27:26.36]We're all done.
[27:28.82]No, we're not.
[27:29.16]What?
[27:30.82]Where's he going?
[27:31.24]What's he doing?
[27:33.42]Are we okay?
[27:35.79]What just happened?
[27:36.33]I don't know.
[27:43.17]No, he's right there.
[27:44.63]I'm lining up the shot.
[27:46.60]I'm going to point blank him right in his face.
[27:50.63]Come on.
[27:51.15]Come take a bite.
[27:51.73]I should have done this in the very beginning.
[27:57.72]Come on over here.
[27:59.52]It's just an animatron.
[28:00.68]Don't worry, guys.
[28:03.48]Here he comes.
[28:05.29]Easy.
[28:05.79]Steady.
[28:08.01]What?
[28:08.37]I can't shoot him when he does that?
[28:12.03]That's bullshit.
[28:27.05]So once he starts attacking the boat, you can't... Now we're dead.
[28:35.35]Okay, well now I know what's going on.
[28:38.77]Now I know what's going on.
[28:39.85]Where is it?
[28:40.23]2015.
[28:41.35]This is auto.
[28:41.79]No.
[28:41.87]Which one do I want?
[28:51.52]2013.
[28:51.62]Yeah, it was this one, right?
[28:58.23]This is crazy.
[29:01.43]Okay, yeah.
[29:02.05]Now I get it.
[29:02.73]I'm gonna take... I'm gonna shoot him in the face with the sniper.
[29:18.80]By the hammer of Sigmar, it's a monster!
[29:20.64]Keep the megalon on, aim for its eyes.
[29:27.95]Isn't that what I was trying to do?
[29:31.65]Wait till he comes up.
[29:36.47]It's kind of difficult to hit this.
[29:38.53]It's actually very difficult to hit him in the face.
[29:42.98]It's hard to determine where the bullets are going.
[29:50.06]Let's go with the wind.
[29:56.76]There he is.
[30:04.48]There's not any of them.
[30:06.32]Come on.
[30:07.26]Come on.
[30:11.54]Come on.
[30:13.10]Shoot him!
[30:13.78]There he goes.
[30:14.28]Alright, go.
[30:16.12]Keep with bay.
[30:18.85]Where do I actually need to be going?
[30:20.76]Ehrengrad, so we gotta go this way.
[30:21.92]I might just be able to make it there.
[30:30.02]Just go Sonic Speed.
[30:32.42]Oh, now he's behind us.
[30:33.44]Now he's behind us.
[30:35.53]This is a good opportunity to do this, though.
[30:43.11]Right in his eye!
[30:43.81]Got him!
[30:44.57]Keep going.
[30:46.80]That's what you gotta do.
[30:47.56]See, I was doing it wrong.
[30:49.52]You need to get him when he's chasing you, not when he's on the boat.
[30:53.45]There, he's behind us again.
[30:57.25]Just, uh, come on, sharpshooter.
[31:00.87]Bang.
[31:03.31]Bang.
[31:04.49]Need another one.
[31:08.63]I'm gonna accidentally shoot this guy in the head.
[31:14.81]He's getting a little close.
[31:15.93]Oh, he's getting too close.
[31:17.95]No, he's not.
[31:18.65]What am I talking about?
[31:19.31]Got him, but it's hard to see.
[31:25.17]Right there.
[31:30.43]Alright, he's down.
[31:33.09]Move.
[31:34.25]Move, move, move, move, move.
[31:36.27]Wow, I'm gonna drive into a fucking dock.
[31:42.00]I want to kill him.
[31:42.78]I feel like you get something cool if you kill him.
[31:44.08]I don't want to just be a chicken and run away.
[31:51.81]Right in the eye.
[31:57.09]Oh, it's so close.
[32:04.16]I'm going to stop moving.
[32:06.30]I'll be completely still.
[32:08.96]There you go.
[32:13.71]Oh, shit.
[32:14.39]Please don't tell me he's going to appear right next to me.
[32:16.47]There he is.
[32:20.43]Now he's going under again.
[32:21.65]Oh, I'm driving right into him.
[32:25.36]I'm driving right into him.
[32:33.40]Oh, shit.
[32:37.31]Where is he?
[32:46.75]Right in the eye.
[32:49.65]Right in his eye.
[32:50.37]Come on, put your head up.
[32:52.35]Go for a bite.
[32:58.10]Got him.
[33:00.00]Jeez.
[33:01.08]That was fucking crazy.
[33:05.35]Do we get to, like, skin him and take his meat?
[33:09.27]He's still in the water.
[33:09.91]That's so cool.
[33:10.45]If there's more than one monster, this is gonna be amazing.
[33:20.12]So it looks like it wasn't a bad idea to do this.
[33:23.58]I guess it needs to be low.
[33:27.78]Because the sounds are just crazy high.
[33:29.84]That was pretty fun though.
[33:37.03]Sail to Aringrad and sell the food.
[33:40.67]You got it.
[33:46.60]I missed a couple of subs here.
[33:49.04]Will Sarcasm, resubscribed for three months.
[33:50.98]Welcome back, Will.
[33:51.97]And Lord Tater for five months.
[33:55.71]Thanks to the both of you guys.
[33:59.59]Welcome back to the two of us.
[34:02.07]This is fun.
[34:03.47]If there's more to this game, this game's gonna be really good.
[34:09.72]If there's like a bunch of monsters and you can board ships and steal and...
[34:16.16]It should be pretty fun.
[34:21.61]Is it snowing right now?
[34:22.69]Or is it like rain?
[34:24.81]Alright, speed it up.
[34:28.61]Speed it up.
[34:33.19]Slow down, slow down.
[34:33.89]I don't want to ram into the fucking rocks.
[34:41.57]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[34:42.41]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[34:47.65]Almost there.
[34:48.17]All right, and dock at Ehrengrad.
[34:52.19]Here we can sell the food and see what else they got.
[34:54.41]All right, so how much is the food?
[34:55.49]So you sell.
[34:56.33]So we bought these for about 500.
[34:57.43]We can sell them for 650.
[34:58.83]Nice.
[35:00.86]All right, we need to patch up the ship.
[35:06.70]Listen to me, son.
[35:09.18]I'm your dad.
[35:11.62]Destroy him!
[35:16.03]Katie Bell.
[35:17.23]Welcome, Katie Bell.
[35:18.13]Thanks for your subscription.
[35:20.65]Hope you enjoy your stay.
[35:22.77]Ah, thank you.
[35:25.54]Can we get some moons in the chat, please, and welcome these new subs and these old subs and these new subs?
[35:32.82]So, I have 2,400 gold.
[35:34.40]I don't get a discount.
[35:36.55]Get favor with different factions.
[35:38.41]That's cool.
[35:41.25]Uh, crew 15, cargo 9.
[35:43.60]So you gotta be careful, because you can burn through money, apparently.
[35:50.08]What should we do now, Captain?
[35:50.96]We can get plenty of work in the ports.
[35:53.10]Side with the Empire or Bretonnia.
[35:55.85]Hunt down pirates, trade goods for a profit.
[35:57.75]What do you want to do?
[36:00.17]Hmm.
[36:01.33]If we earn enough, we can retire, and I can buy that house on the hill in Norton.
[36:06.53]Let's go to the tavern.
[36:08.98]Supplies of Behemoth Horn.
[36:12.16]Dighton Chafin have been low recently, so I bet they'd pay a good price when trading it.
[36:18.36]Behemoth Horn.
[36:20.57]And Laladoria.
[36:22.09]Welcome back, Laladoria, for four months.
[36:24.97]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[36:27.59]So this drunk guy says that behemoth horn... So if he, uh... How much is behemoth horn?
[36:34.30]Should we just go back to the tavern, anybody?
[36:37.04]These guys, like, talk about the shit.
[36:39.86]Nice.
[36:41.32]Put it all on black.
[36:45.52]Starbordom!
[36:46.50]Welcome, Starbordom.
[36:48.31]What do you think?
[36:48.71]Should I trust the drunk guy?
[36:49.71]This guy... This is just kind of little tips.
[36:51.97]When you click on it, he'll tell you, like, where something is, uh... You know, by, low, sell, high.
[36:59.11]Weapons.
[37:01.45]So how much are weapons?
[37:05.27]Weapons.
[37:06.75]Those are way too fucking expensive.
[37:08.59]What was the other one?
[37:10.95]Was it food?
[37:12.08]I don't think I should be spending money right now.
[37:14.74]Go to the shipyard.
[37:16.34]Warehouse.
[37:16.90]Purchase ship.
[37:17.64]You can buy a new ship.
[37:18.52]Purchase firearms.
[37:19.32]Recruit crew.
[37:20.00]I have like no money.
[37:22.26]I need money.
[37:25.66]Warehouse.
[37:26.86]You know items in the warehouse.
[37:30.79]Okay.
[37:33.79]Can I go to bed, please?
[37:34.83]Space Wizard, you can go to bed whenever you want.
[37:36.59]Notice board.
[37:38.73]Something rotten.
[37:40.31]These are missions.
[37:43.47]Assassinations.
[37:44.29]Let's take a look.
[37:46.09]The Merchant's Guild of Arangrad has declared that the first men to slay the pirate, Captain Eberhardt, will receive a bag of gold from their own personal coffers.
[37:55.67]Get out to sea and get that reward before the eager local pirate hunters bring them in.
[38:01.70]Let's do it.
[38:02.31]Let's go kill Captain Eberhart.
[38:05.95]These are all things I can take.
[38:06.95]What's this one?
[38:09.00]Certain wealthy noble who is in the market for gems.
[38:11.18]I'm looking to buy.
[38:11.94]Get me the goods and I'll give you a good price.
[38:13.64]No questions asked.
[38:16.11]One thing at a time.
[38:18.25]There's a lot of folk out in the docks, Captain?
[38:20.89]As you approach the docks of Ervingrad, you can see through a haze of smoke and fog that a throng of people are gathered together in the docks.
[38:26.35]There's a flurry of activity with ships loading and unloading and people just on the verge of panic.
[38:31.62]Drawing closer, you begin to hear terrified people shout, Save us!
[38:34.24]Help us!
[38:35.98]They're watching for something in the streets approaching the docks?
[38:39.68]They looked panicked.
[38:42.68]A haggard old man on the dock speaks on behalf of the others around him, shouting above the noise.
[38:48.41]My lord, Erengrad is overrun by a plague of flesh-eating corpses.
[38:52.21]Please take us away to Norden.
[38:53.89]We'll give you all we have.
[38:55.45]We've put together our coin and have 500 gold crowns between us.
[38:59.17]It's all yours if you help us leave this dreadful place.
[39:03.36]Uh, alright, but you need to go below deck, keep quiet, and you'll be in Norden.
[39:08.86]The plague?
[39:09.46]I don't want the fucking plague.
[39:13.80]They're gonna bring the plague on the ship and it's gonna infect my own men.
[39:18.62]That's not gonna happen.
[39:19.74]No.
[39:20.20]Sorry.
[39:20.66]I'm not doing that.
[39:23.64]Let's go assassinate that guy.
[39:25.06]Alright, let's assassinate him.
[39:29.53]Remember, Captain!
[39:30.69]Nothing ever comes free!
[39:32.29]If we're gonna make a name for ourselves, we need to pick up what work we can find in the ports!
[39:36.96]Do us some trading, and grab the big scars when we can!
[39:39.88]Yeah, well that's fine.
[39:40.56]We can't make a name with no coin!
[39:42.48]And this ain't the world for the timid!
[39:45.26]I also want to do this.
[39:45.96]I want to turn up the brightness a little bit.
[39:48.10]It's a little bit dark.
[39:51.90]Less view distance.
[39:53.04]Where's brightness?
[39:55.74]Can I change brightness?
[39:59.67]Can I even do brightness?
[40:03.37]I don't think so.
[40:06.37]Shit!
[40:07.21]Okay.
[40:07.35]I'm going to save.
[40:09.54]Save.
[40:11.48]Save.
[40:16.51]Got a new phone today, Captain Narwhal?
[40:17.89]Nice.
[40:18.75]I hope it's everything you've ever dreamed of.
[40:20.17]All right, we need to look for... Locate the... Oh, locate the Weisenberg.
[40:23.33]Apparently, it's in the sea out here.
[40:26.75]Apparently, the guy that I need to kill is out here somewhere.
[40:29.95]Oh, we're gonna go sail out there.
[40:36.58]Let's get that... Let's get that money.
[40:42.94]What?
[40:43.62]Ship in distress?
[40:44.38]What?
[40:48.04]Somebody's like, somebody needs help?
[40:49.82]Alright, let's go.
[40:54.42]Let's go help the distressed boat.
[41:03.20]Sailing right into the wind right now.
[41:09.31]I swear to God, if these are pirates and they're just pretending to be hurt and they jump on the boat, I'm going to be really mad.
[41:16.35]Clean the bucket, Irons!
[41:19.13]I need to, like, turn the boat.
[41:21.31]And just sail, like, across.
[41:27.04]Let's take a better look.
[41:29.18]The Sigmar's Woe.
[41:31.28]Captain Koload.
[41:33.14]Zero tons in hold.
[41:35.71]Did I shoot him?
[41:42.05]No, I can't do that.
[41:44.20]I can't do it.
[41:46.44]Thank you for your subscription and welcome.
[41:49.36]We will investigate what happened here.
[41:51.18]We're going to board the ship and we're going to slay them all.
[42:01.85]Speed things up.
[42:02.47]Let's go.
[42:03.15]I'm sailing into the wind, but I have to because I can't get over here any other way.
[42:06.08]Here we go.
[42:09.59]Don't hit any icebergs now.
[42:11.43]Fratty, thanks for four months.
[42:12.97]Welcome back.
[42:14.02]Orc raiders are heading for Erengard.
[42:15.92]The orcs must have known that the home fleet was forced north to face a large chaos invasion.
[42:20.66]Please stop the raiders before they attack the city.
[42:25.53]You're sailing into the wind, Captain!
[42:27.93]Thanks for the info, but where the fuck are they?
[42:29.37]Back to work, you lazy dog!
[42:30.83]Aye, sir!
[42:32.70]Oh, shit.
[42:34.54]I'm driving into stuff.
[42:37.02]Oh, God, what did I do?
[42:38.66]What have I done?
[42:39.20]I don't know.
[42:39.52]Am I in shallow water?
[42:40.44]I think it's over.
[42:43.81]Oh, I gotta press space to push off.
[42:45.89]Push off.
[42:48.45]Go.
[42:50.63]Oh, man.
[42:51.23]There's a lot of boats here.
[42:54.81]There's, like, five boats.
[42:56.29]I have to kill these all?
[43:01.50]Am I gonna be able to do this?
[43:02.46]Are you shitting me?
[43:08.29]I'm just gonna spam over there.
[43:17.35]Do I have any reinforcements?
[43:19.55]They're gonna board.
[43:20.03]They're gonna board.
[43:20.59]I gotta be ready.
[43:21.79]They're gonna ram us.
[43:23.15]They're gonna fucking ram us.
[43:25.55]Oh god!
[43:30.79]I didn't do anything.
[43:34.54]I'm trying to, like, snipe them out.
[43:38.80]Oh, Jesus.
[43:41.34]I'm so overwhelmed.
[43:43.06]I'm extremely overwhelmed right now.
[43:47.32]This, like, ocean.
[43:48.42]I can't even see anything.
[43:49.70]I can't tell what's going on.
[43:50.80]All I can see is these guys on, like, a swamp boat.
[43:52.86]There's two right here.
[43:56.37]Just ram them and fucking board them.
[43:59.19]Get ready.
[44:00.39]Boredom.
[44:02.29]Let's go.
[44:06.64]Get on that boat.
[44:08.68]There's so many of them.
[44:09.98]This was such a bad idea.
[44:10.96]This guy's just kind of letting me through.
[44:16.24]Oh, God.
[44:17.26]No, my crew.
[44:18.88]My crew.
[44:19.85]How do I take out my sword?
[44:21.89]Do I have to buy one?
[44:22.89]Listen to me, son.
[44:27.13]I'm your dad.
[44:30.60]Who's left?
[44:32.04]There's one more right here.
[44:36.12]Bang.
[44:36.38]Did we do it?
[44:38.54]I think we got him.
[44:39.02]Unless there's one left.
[44:41.65]I don't know.
[44:42.83]Yeah, we got him.
[44:43.93]Keep going.
[44:48.45]Oh, where's the other one?
[44:54.37]And...
[44:57.26]I can't tell he's in smoke.
[44:59.32]How far away is he?
[45:00.56]There he is.
[45:03.23]One more of those and he'll be done.
[45:04.15]I don't want to board these guys.
[45:12.65]Yeah, they're done.
[45:13.19]See you later.
[45:14.15]They're fucking sinking.
[45:17.79]He's not dead?
[45:18.70]No, they're done.
[45:22.58]Oh, shit.
[45:23.46]Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[45:28.19]That one's a little bigger, isn't it?
[45:29.11]I can't tell.
[45:32.53]I would sure like it if it was not like blue and gray everywhere.
[45:37.17]I overshot that ship.
[45:45.60]Right, right.
[45:48.14]I can't see anything.
[45:52.57]Just boredom.
[45:56.55]I got a buddy right there anyways.
[45:58.98]Going into the wind too, that's not good.
[46:00.50]I gotta go around.
[46:02.94]I'm going to hit my own friend.
[46:04.38]Get out of the way!
[46:09.36]Ah shit, I hit my friend.
[46:15.87]Keep turning!
[46:16.37]Oh, none of those are landing.
[46:19.79]It's right on him, right?
[46:23.46]What?
[46:24.44]How are those missing?
[46:25.18]Come on.
[46:26.40]Alright, let's just board them.
[46:29.18]Don't worry, he missed too.
[46:34.63]I feel like that's perfect right there.
[46:38.29]There it is.
[46:38.95]How close is he?
[46:54.97]Not much longer.
[46:55.79]This ain't no Halloween game.
[46:59.03]What does that mean?
[47:04.94]Nice.
[47:08.54]You know what?
[47:09.76]I'm just a sitting duck right now.
[47:12.20]We're going to turn.
[47:15.02]Sailing directly into the wind.
[47:17.23]I'm getting broken and shit.
[47:19.07]I'm going to wrap around and we're going to avoid this fucking guy.
[47:26.57]It's so hard to wrap around here.
[47:28.05]I'm sailing into the wind every time.
[47:30.15]I need to turn the boat.
[47:35.34]Yeah, I'll say hi to the subs in a second.
[47:37.60]I just don't want to die.
[47:39.16]If I take my eyes off the screen, I'm just going to be a sitting duck.
[47:42.78]Don't worry.
[47:43.54]I know I miss subs.
[47:45.12]I'm a very bad streamer.
[47:46.35]You just get stuck.
[47:57.32]Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[48:00.49]No.
[48:01.59]Okay, there we go.
[48:02.21]Full speed ahead.
[48:04.95]Just board him.
[48:07.59]I feel like I'm much better when I board.
[48:12.23]Streamer sucks.
[48:14.65]I don't like that lightning.
[48:23.62]Yeah, get boarded.
[48:25.06]How many crew members?
[48:26.10]I got 15 crew members?
[48:27.08]I'm good.
[48:30.20]Whoa!
[48:36.64]Shit, I'm missing.
[48:37.38]No, get on.
[48:37.83]Get with the captain.
[48:39.19]That guy can do his own thing.
[48:42.55]Just lost a crew member so he died.
[48:49.73]Gotta buy better weapons too.
[48:53.66]Shot my own guy.
[48:54.40]It's alright.
[48:55.86]Can I actually get on the boat?
[48:59.52]I don't think I can go on that boat.
[49:00.62]At least not with this guy.
[49:06.45]I'm gonna assume that eventually I can use a different character that can go up there and attack.
[49:10.71]Alright, that's good.
[49:11.79]I need a couple more.
[49:21.08]Yeah, I can't actually board it, I don't think.
[49:24.64]That's this one down, right?
[49:25.92]Did I lose it?
[49:26.98]Almost all my crew is dead.
[49:31.88]Did we take it out?
[49:32.72]Okay, we took it out.
[49:33.40]I can't do that again.
[49:36.78]Shit, they're right up on me.
[49:40.58]I can't let them board.
[49:41.44]They're going to try to board me, though.
[49:43.47]I lost all... I have four guys left.
[49:46.86]What?
[49:47.86]They're gonna try to... Speed, speed, speed, speed.
[49:49.96]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[49:51.80]They're gonna try to board.
[49:53.32]Why wouldn't they?
[49:57.09]They're just creeping up behind us.
[50:02.69]Good.
[50:03.19]We're not sailing into the wind.
[50:04.92]Oh, no.
[50:07.44]They have ten people on that boat.
[50:09.82]I actually might be okay.
[50:16.78]Let's keep this up.
[50:19.28]They're going to kill one of my sails is almost gone.
[50:26.67]Shit.
[50:28.65]Shit.
[50:30.33]Shit.
[50:31.49]Not good.
[50:31.99]Why aren't those guys doing anything?
[50:33.79]Help me.
[50:35.53]Attack this boat.
[50:36.23]You're sitting right next to it.
[50:37.17]This guy right here.
[50:38.81]Make yourself useful.
[50:40.59]This is an orc invasion.
[50:42.11]And here we go.
[50:42.99]Bye.
[50:43.81]One of my sails is gone.
[50:46.89]He's gonna be sinking now, right?
[50:49.69]Yeah.
[50:50.93]I did it.
[50:53.16]Just, you know, insult to injury.
[50:54.42]Make sure they're dead.
[50:56.08]I think that's it.
[50:59.66]Return... Yeah, I'm gonna go back and get some money.
[51:04.12]I gotta go quick.
[51:05.64]Thank God I can repair and... I'd better get some money for this.
[51:08.09]I want to go investigate.
[51:14.37]He's just a tourist.
[51:15.91]Oh, by the way, let's talk about the subscriptions.
[51:17.83]Uh, I, A, sort of, for five months.
[51:19.83]Thanks, A, sort of.
[51:21.57]DeadlyDullness subscribed during that ruckus.
[51:24.55]Thanks to you.
[51:25.16]Thanks to you, DeadlyDullness.
[51:26.36]Welcome to the family.
[51:28.14]Uh, Renix, for five months, is back for five months.
[51:30.70]Thanks a lot, Renix.
[51:32.82]I, sort of, uh, I, sort of, A, sort of, is also for five months.
[51:37.82]Thank you to the three of you guys.
[51:40.42]Welcome back to two of you, and welcome for the first time to... What the fuck was that?
[51:44.50]What's that?
[51:50.51]I don't like being out here on the ocean, I'm not gonna lie.
[51:54.29]I feel like I'm gonna get struck by lightning.
[51:58.43]It's terrifying.
[52:02.31]We can speed up now, we should be safe.
[52:05.86]I'm just waiting for another giant monster to appear and take the boat down.
[52:14.12]The ship gradually repairs itself?
[52:15.56]Yeah, I guess it does.
[52:17.97]That's cool.
[52:23.75]Well, I should get some money for this.
[52:24.99]That was five ships I had to destroy.
[52:27.25]I lost ten people.
[52:31.35]We saw your heroic, Captain, as a token of gratitude for sinking the Orc Raiders.
[52:34.37]I have been instructed to give you 4,000 gold ducats from the treasury to repair your ship.
[52:41.59]Two favor with the kiss lives.
[52:45.07]All right.
[52:45.59]Let's go to the tavern.
[52:46.47]I want to make some money.
[52:49.41]Where about the Empire Tower... What?
[52:52.89]What?
[52:54.68]I hear that they're looking for work.
[53:01.02]Allies will be available in a little bit.
[53:02.44]Okay, that doesn't work.
[53:03.53]Let's do it again.
[53:04.93]Psst.
[53:05.45]Hey, you.
[53:06.29]Want to buy this very valuable treasure map at the low, low price of 466 gold?
[53:10.95]Yeah.
[53:11.05]Alright, where's the treasure?
[53:20.96]You know what?
[53:21.36]I only have four people on board right now.
[53:24.91]What kind of town screen is this?
[53:27.11]It's early access.
[53:29.48]Okay, remember when I was... These guys were freaking out and they all had the plague.
[53:33.96]And they were like, please help us.
[53:36.50]I'm going to do it now because I only have four people in the crew.
[53:41.09]So even if all four of them die, it's okay.
[53:43.43]Because I can just do this.
[53:45.51]Where do they want to go?
[53:47.79]Norden?
[53:49.09]Alright, let's do it.
[53:50.98]500 gold if we're going to Norden.
[53:53.76]Flesh-eating corpses, I hope you know what you're doing.
[53:57.37]Alright, let's go.
[54:02.67]Shit, hold on a second.
[54:04.33]This place is overrun with the plague now?
[54:06.09]I can't... Oh, boy.
[54:09.97]Okay, well, good thing I did nothing there.
[54:12.40]Alright, where's Norton?
[54:13.90]That's where I came from, right?
[54:17.04]Norton, right here.
[54:18.94]So I just gotta go right there.
[54:20.94]Okay.
[54:22.75]So, I'm about to bring the plague from... ...Aerongrad to Norden, aren't I?
[54:32.90]No repairs?
[54:33.32]We don't need repairs.
[54:34.08]We'll be fine.
[54:37.48]Why did I do this?
[54:39.98]I have a bunch of people with the plague on the boat.
[54:47.53]And I'm bringing them to another place to spread the plague.
[54:51.37]Oh well.
[54:53.14]Don't worry, they'll be fine.
[54:54.70]I'll just get some medicine.
[55:00.23]Plus light to help spread the infection.
[55:02.11]Nice.
[55:04.31]Jeez!
[55:07.01]We're doing time for more speed.
[55:08.13]Let's go.
[55:10.67]We're just doing some traveling here.
[55:15.32]You're a hero.
[55:16.48]I gave you rabies.
[55:17.76]Well, we gave them the plague.
[55:20.22]Welcome back, I gave you rabies.
[55:21.30]Thanks for two months.
[55:25.66]Almost there.
[55:26.30]Just a little bit further.
[55:32.63]Get some herbal teas.
[55:34.05]That'll pick something up.
[55:39.73]Whoa, whoa, Captain... What?
[55:42.09]Captain, walking co- walking corpses!
[55:45.51]These people, these are the people with the plague!
[55:48.03]Oh, Jesus!
[55:52.09]What?
[55:54.51]Are you shitting me?
[55:55.45]I only have four people on the crew.
[55:58.11]We're gonna get overrun.
[56:00.67]Oh no.
[56:03.02]Oh god.
[56:03.80]We're all dead.
[56:04.76]They're all dead but me.
[56:10.62]Oh shit.
[56:14.17]Oh god.
[56:14.55]It's okay.
[56:15.19]It's just like duck hunt.
[56:17.97]I'm the only person left alive on the boat.
[56:22.30]Just don't worry.
[56:23.36]I can handle this.
[56:25.44]They're so slow and so stupid.
[56:29.53]Good thing I don't have ammo to run out of.
[56:30.97]You've got to be kidding me.
[56:36.55]And they're spitting this vile shit all over the place.
[56:42.41]Thankfully, I only had four people on the boat.
[56:44.22]If I had like ten people on the boat, I would have wasted so much money.
[56:46.94]I was going to buy like a sniper too.
[56:48.28]Speaking of sniper, do I still have him?
[56:51.06]He's up top, isn't he?
[56:54.15]Yeah, I still got it.
[56:55.45]This is technically not a crew member.
[56:56.85]He's controlled by me.
[56:57.82]Yeah, we're good.
[57:00.98]Alright.
[57:02.80]Throw the foul things overboard, lads, in case they think about getting back up again.
[57:07.42]Well, that sure was fun.
[57:12.18]We'll need a few good lads to go down to the hold and see if anyone's left alive.
[57:15.44]It's a good thing we got their payment up front.
[57:18.40]It wasn't even worth it.
[57:21.40]Yeah, those, like, shitty people that I can buy are 100 gold each.
[57:24.80]It didn't even replace... It barely replaced the, like... I gotta... Where's the... I can't even go back to that town.
[57:30.36]I can't go back here.
[57:32.42]I have to go to Norden and see if I can buy some shit.
[57:38.75]So, we're gonna just wrap around.
[57:40.01]Hey, Waylon147, thanks for five months.
[57:44.77]Welcome back, dude.
[57:48.03]Five-monther.
[57:51.56]I need crew members and I need... I can make some money.
[57:57.42]There are no good lads left.
[57:58.66]That really wasn't worth it at all.
[58:02.93]Is there a way to turn the fog down?
[58:06.31]Actually, that's a good question.
[58:10.19]Let's see what that does.
[58:11.09]Ah.
[58:16.57]Not really.
[58:17.01]What's wrong with these guys?
[58:23.83]Do they have bigger ship upgrades?
[58:25.11]I believe they do.
[58:27.47]I think there are bigger ship upgrades.
[58:28.78]There's a whole warehouse you can do.
[58:34.48]I really hope I don't bring the plague here.
[58:35.94]This is going to be bad.
[58:43.41]And we're at the dock.
[58:46.17]Let's do this.
[58:54.03]What's going on?
[58:57.59]I'm a grill, by the way.
[58:58.95]Hey, Meep617!
[59:01.49]What's going on in this town?
[59:02.37]This town looks like it's on fire.
[59:06.76]That was weird.
[59:08.92]Alright.
[59:10.24]Docks.
[59:11.58]See, purchase ship.
[59:13.34]Yeah?
[59:15.78]There are all kinds of ships, I guess.
[59:19.76]This one's 100,000.
[59:21.48]Only available at a large shipyard.
[59:22.86]Yeah, so these are smaller ones.
[59:24.36]I kind of like this little war galley.
[59:26.82]It's cool.
[59:27.18]I don't have enough money, though.
[59:30.51]How much is this going to cost to repair?
[59:31.93]Well, that's fine.
[59:34.05]I'll do it.
[59:34.39]I don't want to wait.
[59:41.53]Hire allied captain.
[59:42.69]Recruit crew.
[59:44.79]Damn it.
[59:50.04]I have to do it.
[59:50.86]You need, like, a full crew.
[59:52.02]I mean, you don't need it, but it's probably better that way.
[59:55.99]Alright, tavern.
[59:58.81]No, fuck off.
[60:00.01]Come on, tell me where... They say the Captain Donati at Wargalley.
[60:03.29]No one is... Ah, it's early access.
[60:04.79]Can't do it.
[60:06.99]Herongrad has been ravaged by the plague.
[60:08.64]Yeah, I know.
[60:08.94]It just came from there.
[60:11.50]Come on, give me, like, a market tip.
[60:16.84]Come on.
[60:17.34]That's all you got for me?
[60:20.38]What do you got here?
[60:20.98]Stockpiles.
[60:23.15]The storerooms of the biggest wine merchant in Norden were burned and looted in the last raid.
[60:27.15]The owner will reward anybody who can help resupply.
[60:29.79]So I need to bring wine in.
[60:32.47]Yeah, I'll do it.
[60:38.56]So right now, buy, sell.

[60:44.88]So I gotta bring in a bunch of wine.
[60:50.56]Okay.
[60:50.80]I'm gonna have to go to a different place.
[60:55.22]All right, well, let me look at the map.
[61:02.31]Curse to sail.
[61:06.07]It's at a waypoint.
[61:07.67]Where was the treasure map?
[61:13.33]Is there actually like a thing I can see where the treasure is?
[61:15.96]Listen to me, son.
[61:17.56]I'm your dad.
[61:24.39]Radio video.
[61:25.35]Welcome, radio video.
[61:26.25]I wonder if there's a... Maybe that is what the treasure is.
[61:30.85]I can't really tell what it is by looking at it.
[61:33.77]Quests.
[61:34.17]Captain of World.
[61:35.05]Ship.
[61:37.09]Journal entry.
[61:41.33]If you can fill the... Oh, that's awesome.
[61:45.18]I can't wait to be terrified by another giant monster.
[61:51.19]Where's it gonna go?
[61:51.93]We're gonna go get wine.
[61:53.51]I got a full crew.
[61:58.64]I'm good to go.
[62:04.84]And speed it up.
[62:10.66]Full speed ahead.
[62:18.88]Ship sighted.
[62:20.76]Where?
[62:22.98]Whoa.
[62:23.46]Ooh, what's that?
[62:27.00]The cursed sail?
[62:28.21]Six tons in hold?
[62:29.45]What does that mean?
[62:33.85]Let's go investigate.
[62:38.77]Six tons in hold.
[62:42.18]I'll take it.
[62:47.25]Captain Berg.
[62:50.57]It's gonna be zombies, but I'll be ready.
[62:52.17]I got a lot of, uh... I got a lot of crewmen now.
[62:56.95]Okay, what's going on here?
[63:01.75]Going easy, going easy.
[63:04.25]Slow it down.
[63:04.95]You never know when a fucking monster's gonna show up.
[63:11.37]Uh... Okay.
[63:17.64]Hello?
[63:19.04]Board the cursed sail.
[63:21.78]Are there people on there?
[63:22.64]Oh, they're being, like, held up.
[63:27.02]Let's go.
[63:31.91]Oh, there's six food.
[63:36.31]Okay, thanks.
[63:38.99]Thanks for the food.
[63:41.01]Are we just leaving them?
[63:41.99]Hold on a second.
[63:42.63]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[63:45.18]That's it?
[63:50.58]I guess you're just like... I can't help these people?
[63:57.02]How do you help them?
[63:58.72]No, you can just take their shit.
[64:01.05]Alright, well... Sorry, guys.
[64:05.13]But you're no longer necessary for the bigger picture.
[64:14.78]You fucking landlubbers.
[64:15.96]There's like a karma system, by the way.
[64:23.74]Let me turn around.
[64:24.70]Let me get a good shot here.
[64:30.32]Let's line this up.
[64:36.60]I can actually help them.
[64:39.66]But what I can do is I can sharpshoot them.
[64:45.53]Thanks.
[64:49.41]Ahoy there!
[64:56.76]Alright, this is not cool.
[64:57.96]I don't want to do this.
[65:00.76]Oh, fuck.
[65:01.34]Now people think I'm a jerk.
[65:03.94]Bye.
[65:10.95]They're all so happy about it.
[65:15.45]What a sharp shot that was.
[65:16.79]Alright, what am I doing?
[65:20.09]Mastodon.
[65:20.71]The Middleheim.
[65:21.77]Oh, these are different ships.
[65:23.20]Okay.
[65:25.38]I need to go, like... Where do I need to go?
[65:27.74]Oh, I need wine.
[65:31.26]Uh, we'll try going to Maha.
[65:35.14]We'll go this way.
[65:36.88]Or no, let's go this way.
[65:38.20]Neue Emschrank.
[65:40.48]I think I'm a little bit closer to that one.
[65:45.96]Can I, like, board this ship?
[65:47.16]I bet you you can.
[65:48.86]These are neutral ships.
[65:49.82]I guarantee I can just board them and take all their stuff.
[65:56.86]Sorry about those sapphires.
[65:58.74]No, I don't want to make enemies right now.
[66:10.17]Okay, we are going over here.
[66:12.93]Yeah, we're going the right way.
[66:14.45]Going the right way.
[66:15.57]Speed it up.
[66:17.42]Super speed.

[66:24.72]How do I hold the horn down?
[66:28.10]I would hold the horn down right now.

[66:32.61]What are you stupid?
[66:33.45]Dumbass.
[66:43.45]This way.
[66:45.97]Should be straight ahead.
[66:49.96]Straight ahead.
[66:54.24]I hear music.
[66:58.12]Why do I hear music?
[67:04.28]Is there like a ship around here?
[67:09.25]Okay, yeah.
[67:09.89]There's a smoke ship.
[67:11.19]Okay.
[67:11.77]Where is it?

[67:34.96]Save the King Cup?
[67:36.80]Or plunder the King Cup?
[67:41.50]Uh... I don't know.
[67:43.83]They have such a little... Like, now they're just shooting at me.
[67:49.35]Now... Okay, big mistake.
[67:50.41]Now I know who I'm gonna help.
[67:51.31]You idiot.
[67:54.97]I was just thinking if I was gonna, like, help you or not.
[67:58.68]What a stupid asshole.
[68:03.82]None of those hit.
[68:06.84]He's just laying waste to me right now.
[68:15.04]What the fuck?
[68:17.44]That one doesn't hit.
[68:18.12]That one doesn't hit.
[68:19.78]Make up your mind.
[68:20.58]Hit the sail.
[68:24.25]Hit him!
[68:25.39]How is that not fucking doing any damage?
[68:28.19]He's gonna kill me.
[68:34.20]Finally, Jesus.
[68:39.82]I'm taking so much unnecessary... I should have just kept going.
[68:41.72]I need money.
[68:42.38]I don't want to take more damage.
[68:46.82]That's too short and that's too far.
[68:50.69]Right there.
[68:58.59]Come on.
[69:01.55]Right there.
[69:02.03]Right in the front.
[69:06.26]And then I'm gonna board that other ship and plunder the fuck out of them.
[69:13.83]Done.
[69:14.31]See ya.
[69:16.57]No, not done.
[69:18.85]Not actually done.
[69:20.11]Okay.
[69:20.37]See, now you're done.
[69:25.98]Now you get over here.
[69:27.72]Come here.

[69:35.21]Fuck over here.
[69:42.10]I just smashed into it.
[69:44.66]I wanna board them!
[69:45.84]Fucking come on!
[69:46.96]I wanna get on their boat!
[69:49.71]Is anybody even on this boat?
[70:04.21]Give me what they had!
[70:07.97]Didn't they give me, like, a choice?
[70:09.23]I can't, like, go and take their stuff now?
[70:16.23]What did I... What have I done?
[70:17.66]What happened?
[70:24.84]Okay.
[70:26.50]Well, now I... Now I have, apparently, the other... I don't know.
[70:30.61]No idea.
[70:34.95]Fuck it, whatever.
[70:37.01]We're riding solo.
[70:39.41]We gotta go the other way.
[70:42.51]We're gonna go this way.
[70:43.71]Fuck them, who cares.
[70:44.41]Wait, is that the- is that the people that I just killed?
[70:55.62]Is it the same, like, company of people?
[71:00.20]Thorn re-destroyed corn chips?
[71:04.42]What?
[71:05.54]Is that a corn chip?
[71:09.77]Okay, I can destroy the corn husks.
[71:11.71]I'm gonna die.
[71:13.03]I wasn't not prepared for this.
[71:19.04]They look like they have a lot of firepower there.
[71:22.40]Is it a giant cannon?
[71:23.26]I hope it's not a giant cannon.
[71:24.94]Please don't be a giant cannon.
[71:28.20]My weapons are terrible.
[71:30.91]He's just flying into us.
[71:33.87]What is this pod racer?
[71:34.93]Get out of here!
[71:36.59]Get out of here.
[71:37.61]Get your fucking spaceship away from me.
[71:40.29]What is this?
[71:41.05]It's like a crab.
[71:42.15]What is this?
[71:42.45]What's going on?
[71:44.47]What is this thing doing?
[71:46.15]Get on board.
[71:46.93]There's a Minotaur.
[71:51.99]They have a Minotaur.
[71:53.37]Oh fuck.
[71:58.50]Oh my god, we're on fire.
[72:03.66]Just fell.
[72:05.06]Where's my captain?
[72:06.32]Oh my goodness!
[72:10.90]How come they're fighting for the orcs?
[72:16.26]He's trying to kick me.
[72:17.28]I got, like, hatchets.
[72:19.71]Oh, Jesus.
[72:21.41]Oh, no.
[72:22.47]Come on, men.
[72:24.03]Help me.
[72:24.69]Save your captain.
[72:29.45]He did it.
[72:30.97]Nice.
[72:32.80]Ooh, I'll take all your weapons.
[72:34.52]Thank you very much.
[72:40.24]Okay, easy.
[72:41.44]Dead.
[72:43.96]Forget about your Minotaur.
[72:45.28]He's dead.
[72:47.01]Oh, I went way the wrong way.
[72:49.39]I'm gonna go that way.
[72:50.39]No, wait, that's not even me.
[72:51.21]That's the hogfish.
[72:52.09]No, I'm going the right way.
[72:56.17]I could put a waypoint, couldn't I?
[72:57.47]Yeah, that's easier.
[73:03.82]I can't believe you managed that.
[73:04.80]I don't know what the hell it was doing.
[73:05.74]It was coming in with the crab claws.
[73:09.32]Just driving... I bet you that if the AI wasn't stupid, it probably can grab the ship with the giant claw and just crush you or something.
[73:26.40]Only lost two crew members.
[73:28.94]What?
[73:33.84]We need more.
[73:34.41]What are they saying?

[82:31.31]No.
[82:31.61]It's just rubbish.
[82:33.63]It's just a little bit of rubbish.
[82:34.81]Don't worry, guys.
[82:46.99]I should go through the rocks somehow.
[82:48.42]Wait, speaking of rocks, there is a bunch of shit over here.
[82:54.42]Can I even get that?
[82:55.16]I don't think I can even squeeze through here.
[82:58.56]Slow down, slow down.
[82:59.22]I don't... I'm gonna crash.
[83:03.66]Oh my god, I just picked up so much food and stuff.
[83:06.79]Wow.
[83:11.33]Jesus!
[83:13.19]No!
[83:14.47]No!
[83:14.69]Oh boy!
[83:15.73]Oh boy!
[83:16.92]Oh boy!
[83:18.60]Everybody calm down.
[83:21.74]Calm down.
[83:22.14]I don't know how to get us out of this.
[83:27.40]I don't know what to do.
[83:39.77]No, no.
[83:40.61]Pushing off just puts me back in the rock.
[83:46.09]Let's get...
[83:49.45]I can't get out of here.
[83:54.21]Just... I'm gonna have to go forward.
[83:58.33]Slow, slow, slow.
[84:00.31]Back it up.
[84:01.40]Back, back, back, back, back.
[84:04.06]I can't back up.
[84:04.76]This isn't a fucking tractor trailer.
[84:06.28]It's a boat.
[84:06.86]I can't do this.
[84:07.56]It's over.
[84:08.60]Hold on.
[84:12.06]Just coast.
[84:12.66]I'm gonna coast out of here.
[84:14.69]I'm gonna coast out of here.
[84:15.63]I'm gonna make it.
[84:17.65]Don't touch anything.
[84:18.93]I'm stuck.
[84:21.53]Come on, you fucking bastard.
[84:24.11]Get me out.
[84:26.09]Get me off the rollercoaster tycoon ride.
[84:31.67]Okay.
[84:32.89]We're almost out of this.
[84:33.91]No.
[84:46.84]Ah, we're okay.
[84:48.82]We're fine.
[84:51.14]Got out.
[84:53.14]Save it.
[84:55.04]Just in case something stupid like that happens again.
[84:58.40]Let's go.
[85:04.94]That was, yeah, that was when somebody goes on a big loop-de-loop in Rollercoaster Tycoon.
[85:10.54]It goes... I think this is a hostile in front of me, by the way.
[85:14.95]Nope.
[85:20.55]Yeah, we'll buff those scratches out, Captain.
[85:32.04]It's a ship, not a boat.
[85:33.47]Oh, come on.
[85:34.03]Tomato, tomato.
[85:41.07]This is way more effective.
[85:42.25]Actually, just sailing around and picking up random shit.
[85:45.01]That was three iron.
[85:46.67]That would cost me like almost a thousand gold.
[85:49.67]Just sail around and pick shit up.
[85:52.00]And sell it.
[85:57.98]Thank you very much.
[85:58.74]I will take whatever this is.
[86:00.44]Eight timber.
[86:01.18]Look at that.
[86:01.50]Are you kidding me?
[86:05.32]It's that easy.
[86:08.97]Where am I right now?
[86:09.65]Kind of in the middle of nowhere.
[86:11.55]What is that?
[86:14.17]I want to investigate that.
[86:15.97]It's this thing right here.
[86:16.73]Whatever this is.
[86:19.53]Save it.
[86:19.85]I don't know.
[86:20.25]This might be like a fucking monster.
[86:30.20]Well, why would this just be sitting out here?
[86:31.64]It's oddly shaped rock.
[86:34.08]It's gonna turn into a monster.
[86:39.24]I am prepared.
[86:40.46]It's a different color than all the rocks.
[86:42.22]That's definitely a fucking monster.
[86:43.47]It has to be.
[86:43.91]Look at it.
[86:44.95]What is that?
[86:46.59]That's not a rock.
[86:47.77]That's the top of a kraken's head.
[86:54.91]I'm terrified right now.
[86:55.98]This is a monster.
[87:02.08]Oh, there's a boat here.
[87:02.86]Can I do anything with it?
[87:15.02]What is that?
[87:15.88]What, it's just a rock?
[87:18.04]Oh well, it's just a rock.
[87:23.48]Chaotica, thank you, welcome.
[87:25.40]Chaotica.
[87:25.90]I'm sailing against the fucking wind.
[87:31.82]It's a giant turtle.
[87:33.00]Looks like it.
[87:35.94]But thank you very much, Chaotica.
[87:38.28]Well...
[87:40.99]Not a fucking family.
[87:47.81]Let's just keep going wherever we're going to go.
[87:49.05]I'm going to turn this wine in.
[87:50.51]It's not wine, it's tin.
[87:53.19]Turn the tin in and continue going to the manor with his tea.
[87:57.04]It's a really bumpy road.
[88:03.80]I need to, like, repair this road.
[88:11.66]Some crewmen out here.
[88:13.28]Pave it up.
[88:13.66]There's a fight going on up here.
[88:21.50]Yep.
[88:24.22]There is a fight going on up here.
[88:25.80]I'm gonna board him.
[88:29.36]I got a new gun for captain.
[88:30.52]It's a Magnum.
[88:33.06]Getting up there.
[88:34.82]Right in his face.
[88:37.52]Fifteen crewmen.
[88:40.84]Yeah, get up there.
[88:46.42]I got a buddy here too.
[88:49.50]Get boarded!
[88:50.38]And get destroyed.
[88:51.86]Thank you very much.
[88:54.02]Hello!
[88:56.28]I can't board him!
[88:58.70]I can't board this boat!
[89:00.30]Oh, they're already being boarded.
[89:04.36]If I shoot, I'm gonna hit the boat next to him.
[89:07.08]That's how dumb this is right now.
[89:09.76]How about right now?
[89:10.34]Here we go.
[89:15.90]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[89:18.88]I'm hurting myself.
[89:23.91]I can't board this.
[89:24.97]This is stupid.
[89:25.85]You know what?
[89:26.71]I got a better idea.
[89:30.51]No, they're already dead.
[89:32.45]They're dead.
[89:32.86]Nice.
[89:38.40]Where am I?
[89:39.14]Which boat am I on?
[89:41.71]What just happened?
[89:45.22]What?
[89:45.86]They won that fight?
[89:46.92]Oh, come on.
[89:53.05]Bullshit.
[89:53.55]Alright, I'll take him out.
[89:58.21]Though, I can get those supplies, though.
[90:04.61]This is not good.
[90:05.41]I don't want to take unnecessary damage, but you know.
[90:08.93]I'm boarding.
[90:10.37]Let's go.
[90:11.11]You think you can take out one of my ships?
[90:13.67]Try taking on the fucking captain.
[90:23.34]Let's go.
[90:23.78]Get out of town.
[90:31.87]This gun is weird.
[90:32.81]This is a weird gun.
[90:40.82]Ow!
[90:42.02]Hey, Charlie!
[90:42.94]Turn the fuck around and shoot!
[90:46.54]What are you doing?
[90:47.82]He's gonna die.
[90:48.36]This is my first mate and he's gonna die.
[90:52.55]Fucking idiot.
[90:53.99]He's dead.
[91:01.99]I still have 14 crew members.
[91:03.48]My first mate sucks.
[91:10.00]Please, just kill him.
[91:10.86]I'm just... He's dead?
[91:15.82]He's dead.
[91:16.32]Did we do it?
[91:16.89]I didn't even lose anybody besides that one guy.
[91:19.91]Can I... Can I... Please, somebody can, like, jump on.
[91:28.47]Who's left?
[91:29.41]Oh, one idiot.
[91:31.20]Is it the captain?
[91:32.90]This guy's got a yellow name.
[91:34.10]Is it a boss?
[91:35.84]This looks kind of like a boss.
[91:38.70]Except he's just standing here.
[91:40.12]Look at this guy to my right.
[91:48.44]Oh yeah, we did it.
[91:50.20]That was cool.
[91:51.27]Nice job, Captain.
[91:53.37]Ooh.
[91:56.53]Nah, that's a lot of 10.
[91:57.97]I got 20 10?
[91:58.25]Sick, that was cool.
[92:16.41]Let's keep moving.
[92:20.58]Celebrate with parkour.
[92:26.42]I only lost one crew member, and it was the first mate, but I guess he can't be killed.
[92:32.34]Hey, ghost food, thanks for five months.
[92:37.77]I love you, Biebs.
[92:39.81]Biebs?
[92:42.73]Well, regardless, am I Biebs?
[92:46.52]Thanks, Ghost Food.
[92:47.18]Welcome back, dude.
[92:47.72]Alright, where am I at?
[92:53.05]Getting there.
[92:53.37]What is this?
[92:54.81]What was that?
[92:56.51]We're about to go through it.
[92:57.25]I don't know what it is, but I'm scared.
[92:59.39]This place has a fucking plague, I think.
[93:02.15]Famine?
[93:04.23]I better get there quick so I can sell my shit and leave.
[93:13.20]Better save it too.
[93:13.92]I have a lot of stuff on board and I wouldn't want to lose it.
[93:19.95]We're all Biebs.
[93:26.25]What am I in combat with?
[93:32.81]It just said I was in combat.
[93:33.99]What the hell is that?
[93:38.83]Let's go.
[93:41.29]Might be able to sell food there.
[93:42.31]Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[93:44.53]Sell some food.
[93:52.88]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[93:56.08]This aspect of the game is really fun.
[93:58.44]It seems like there's a lot to do if you just want to sail around and kill shit and trade.
[94:07.00]I was hoping for some land stuff, like being able to actually go on land and sword fight and stuff, but... You know.
[94:14.64]I'm enjoying it, regardless.
[94:17.88]We're almost there.
[94:21.79]Oh, I think we're in that blue circle now.
[94:23.31]I don't know what the hell it means, but... Fuck, I'm in the wind.
[94:31.85]Get me out of the way.
[94:33.65]Destroy...
[94:37.96]these ships.
[94:40.87]Do I have to?
[94:46.21]I've got to get out of the... I guess, yeah, like someone was saying, these are factions, so you can get kills.
[94:53.36]If I destroyed that boat right there, I'd lose reputation with these guys.
[94:56.84]I'd probably gate it with somebody else.
[95:02.06]You need to... I've got to get away from this stupid...
[95:09.01]For the first time, I think since playing the game, I actually have like a clear open sky.
[95:12.13]Can I zoom out too?
[95:13.31]I'm curious.
[95:16.37]Toggle map.
[95:18.05]Change movement type.
[95:20.39]Time speed up.
[95:21.05]Change target.
[95:22.07]Stripe ship.
[95:23.59]E and Q. Wizard special?
[95:26.63]What the fuck is a wizard special?
[95:36.64]Cycle control mode.
[95:38.58]Toggle map.
[95:42.36]I want to, like, pull back a little if it's possible.
[95:50.86]I'm not sure how to even do it.
[95:58.26]Into the dumbass wind again.
[96:00.43]Press J. Oh, J's like turning the sails.
[96:08.48]Jewel wizardry.
[96:09.88]I forgot about that.
[96:16.15]We'll get there.
[96:17.63]Just wait a few minutes or two.
[96:20.65]This is pretty, though.
[96:22.13]Look at how pretty this is.
[96:27.27]I got a lot of stuff to sell here.
[96:30.81]I'm going to make a dickload of money.
[96:37.25]This place is famine.
[96:38.19]I'm going to sell the food.
[96:39.63]And I needed to bring tin here anyways.
[96:42.69]Dude, I'm going to make a fucking million dollars.
[96:47.63]A million.
[96:52.65]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[96:56.53]Just get me there.
[96:57.31]I know I'm in the wind, but get me to the dock.
[96:59.36]Let's go.
[96:59.80]Okay.
[97:02.39]Market 10 sell for average price pay that's a good payout.
[97:09.81]Yeah I'll take fucking cash and what about food?
[97:19.57]Oh damn look at that average price paid three gold boink I'm gonna keep some food though
[97:34.13]Anything else?
[97:39.77]Hmm.
[97:41.57]Well, I just made, like, $6,000.
[97:46.89]I could sell... I could get, like, a profit with this, couldn't I?
[97:50.02]No.
[97:50.14]What else do I have that I don't have a lot of?
[97:55.54]I got a lot of this.
[97:56.52]This is, like...
[97:58.79]Timber.
[97:59.21]I could sell it.
[98:00.49]I'd make about a thousand.
[98:02.43]No, I'd make like three thousand.
[98:03.44]I'm gonna sell the fuck out of the iron and timber.
[98:05.56]Wait, nah.
[98:10.38]Maybe I should.
[98:11.86]Yeah, I'll do it.
[98:12.96]Average price paid, a hundred gold.
[98:14.36]Yeah, one, two, three.
[98:19.36]I could go up.
[98:20.01]I could buy a new boat.
[98:21.43]But couldn't I?
[98:26.51]I have a lot of timber.
[98:29.41]Yeah, I'm close.
[98:31.41]I got 10,000.
[98:33.75]$10,000.
[98:34.87]Can I do something with it?
[98:36.31]Let's go to shipyard.
[98:38.24]Purchase ship.
[98:40.52]It's 25.
[98:41.04]Oh, this is... Wait a second.
[98:42.00]Wait a second.
[98:42.42]Wait a second.
[98:42.82]Wait a second.
[98:43.22]Wait a second.
[98:44.58]These are different ships.
[98:53.72]Right?
[98:54.14]Wasn't there one for 10?
[98:56.74]Iron Fist.
[98:59.67]Ship, Jerma, ship.
[99:03.51]Let's go take a look at the tavern.
[99:06.57]No, I don't want to buy your dumb fucking... No, I don't.
[99:09.25]He just dropped the price by 200 gold.
[99:12.35]Supplies of textiles at Ehrengrad have been low recently.
[99:17.09]Textiles, huh?
[99:18.99]Well.
[99:20.94]Textiles, huh?
[99:23.42]Well.
[99:27.14]These seem kind of expensive.
[99:30.13]Are these too expensive to buy here?
[99:38.30]I feel like I'm wasting money.
[99:39.66]146 gold.
[99:40.12]For one.
[99:43.44]I'm not sure I want to do that.
[99:48.50]Hmm.
[99:49.46]What do you guys think?
[99:50.79]Should I buy, like, 50?
[99:54.97]And bring them back to Arangrad?
[100:00.34]All in on textiles?
[100:04.60]I'm just going to go all in.
[100:05.96]I'm going to buy 57 textiles.
[100:11.89]The plague.
[100:13.09]Yeah, they're covered in plague juice.
[100:19.17]Buy all the rum.
[100:24.24]Stop trading and go kill some beasts.
[100:25.72]But I want to trade.
[100:26.44]I want to trade.
[100:29.48]It's a rip-off.
[100:31.10]I'll hold on to my money.
[100:32.76]We still got another place to go.
[100:34.63]So, I'm just going to repair.
[100:38.75]A refit ship.
[100:39.51]Hold on.
[100:39.99]Hold on.
[100:40.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[100:47.00]That sucks.
[100:47.50]Why would I do that?
[100:51.80]Long-range cannons.
[100:53.12]Heavy timbering.
[100:57.85]I'm scared walking around with this much money, though.
[100:59.71]I feel like I'm just going to lose it.
[101:10.27]Peter handgun.
[101:11.85]Blunderbuss.
[101:12.39]I'll buy some more.
[101:16.11]So, if I buy these, it goes to the crew?
[101:19.02]No, it only goes to the captain.
[101:20.70]I get it.
[101:24.78]I understand.
[101:29.35]This is not a feature that's in the game yet.
[101:32.91]Okay.
[101:33.45]Let's just spend the 500 gold, repair it.
[101:36.50]I got a 50% discount.
[101:38.92]So, we're good.
[101:40.40]Not gonna buy anything.
[101:41.18]I just wanna go to the notice board and see what they have here.
[101:43.50]Stockpile ship hunt.
[101:49.46]Oh, fuck you.
[101:50.68]Stockpiles.
[101:57.60]Datershafen?
[102:00.04]Alright, what's on the way?
[102:03.24]Oh, this is like the same quest twice.
[102:05.46]Okay, we're going to take it.
[102:08.30]Oh.
[102:12.87]No, I took the wine one.
[102:14.73]It's easy enough.
[102:15.35]How much is wine here?
[102:18.73]Oh boy, that's fucking... No, never mind.
[102:20.77]That's too expensive.
[102:21.91]550.
[102:21.97]Let's just go.
[102:22.83]I've got places to be.
[102:33.01]I can hear fireworks.
[102:39.10]Is the game multiplayer?
[102:39.94]No, it is not.
[102:42.70]It is single player only.
[102:46.10]At the moment.
[102:46.52]I'm not sure what their plans are.
[102:49.26]Pirate port.
[102:51.60]So towns can get taken over.
[102:52.82]That's kind of cool.
[102:54.92]Orc port.
[102:55.49]Alright, we're going to go there.
[103:01.16]I'm going to investigate what that is.
[103:02.44]I want to see what it is.
[103:08.38]If that is a monster, then I'm prepared.
[103:14.89]Quality sailing.
[103:26.83]Hmm.
[103:32.51]Can you free a port?
[103:33.39]Probably.
[103:33.75]I wouldn't be surprised if you could.
[103:41.15]There's like five factions in the game, I think.
[103:46.75]We're going to go get attacked by whatever this is.
[103:48.75]It's probably like a Kraken.
[103:49.77]Get out of here.
[103:57.49]Monster hunter adventures.
[103:58.62]Yeah, we're looking for a monster.
[104:03.97]Definitely the coolest part of the whole game.
[104:07.24]And there has to be more than one.
[104:10.34]The giant shark was terrifying.
[104:12.26]I hope there's a giant squid.
[104:19.12]How close are we?
[104:20.44]Not close at all.
[104:22.66]We've got a long way to go.
[104:33.28]I just feel like something's going to jump out.
[104:37.43]I'm just going to sail around until I can jump scare.
[104:45.33]The Kraken.
[104:48.36]Right into the wind again.
[104:49.18]Like that's a giant squid, right?
[104:58.68]Look at that thing.
[105:00.80]We're going monster hunting, guys.
[105:01.90]I'm gonna go kill that fucking thing.
[105:03.14]I need to, like, shift the weight of the boat.
[105:13.55]This giant rat.
[105:17.37]Oh, it's definitely a gigantic kraken.
[105:19.15]It's gonna be terrifying.
[105:21.33]I can't wait.
[105:21.93]I mean, we're actually here right now, so... Might as well do this first.
[105:38.72]Did the wind change?
[105:39.44]Can I actually turn the boat now?
[105:43.37]Not really.
[105:43.81]Oh, wait a minute.
[105:50.81]Treasure.
[105:52.87]Gotta find the rock formation that looks like... I think it's right there.
[105:56.44]What was that photo?
[106:02.10]The photo had like the rock in the background, right?
[106:07.50]It's right there.
[106:07.98]If I wasn't sailing right into the fucking wind.
[106:20.01]I don't like that feature.
[106:25.46]Seems slightly unnecessary.
[106:26.82]And by slightly I mean completely.
[106:38.17]How do I turn the sails, can I?
[106:42.63]It's right here.
[106:44.04]Hey, German, hope your head's feeling better.
[106:48.56]Well, read my letter, it is feeling much better.
[106:50.48]Thank you for your four months.
[106:56.16]It's right here, right?
[107:03.71]I'm going to get stuck again.
[107:04.67]It's not going to be good.
[107:06.86]I'm in the right spot, though.
[107:09.76]It's right there.
[107:11.94]Say your prayers.
[107:14.14]Am I going to make it through that?
[107:15.20]Yeah, I did.
[107:15.62]Alright, where is it?
[107:20.02]Isn't this what the picture looked like?
[107:21.30]There it is.
[107:22.14]Treasure.
[107:23.62]In the crystal crag formation.
[107:27.54]Found it.
[107:30.30]Found it.
[107:35.11]Right?
[107:36.37]That looks like a treasure boat ship.
[107:43.76]The sound of the ocean is making me sleepy.
[107:48.74]Is that it?
[107:55.75]This looks like a thing that I need to be looking for.
[108:00.95]Apparently not.
[108:05.03]No, this is what the picture looks like.
[108:07.28]I'm looking at the photo right now, right?
[108:10.14]This has to be the boat.
[108:11.56]It has to be.
[108:13.26]No, it's not.
[108:17.58]Huh.
[108:18.52]Well.
[108:20.46]Where the fuck is it?
[108:21.38]Is it on the other side?
[108:24.32]I don't see anything.
[108:37.89]f f f I don't get it I don't know where is this treasure I was I was told to be a treasure sitting over here somewhere well the yellow marker is the marker that I made see I can put it anywhere
[109:05.10]I have no fucking idea.
[109:07.14]Locate the Weisenberg.
[109:08.38]Wouldn't that... Isn't that it?
[109:10.32]That looks like the Heisenberg, right?
[109:16.91]This is the only thing of discernible interest that's over here.
[109:20.41]Should I just blow it up?
[109:25.71]That's not the Heisenberg.
[109:31.06]Okay.
[109:33.38]Was I just lied to?
[109:37.28]Journey to Manon's Teeth.
[109:38.28]That's where I am.
[109:38.87]I guess not.
[109:43.71]Whatever.
[109:48.19]Maybe like where the lighthouse... Where the light is burning?
[109:52.69]Don't know.
[109:59.99]I'm about to give up and go fight the Kraken.
[110:09.81]Doesn't seem like there's anything I can do here.
[110:11.91]I can't get off the boat, so... Okay.
[110:23.32]Journey to Manon's Teeth.
[110:25.26]I just did it.
[110:26.46]I didn't see anything.
[110:31.14]Okay, bye.
[110:34.50]Time to fight the Kraken.
[110:36.08]Where's the nearest Kraken?
[110:38.47]Full speed ahead.
[110:42.15]I have no idea what the hell it wanted me to do over there.
[110:44.55]But I couldn't figure it out.
[110:46.68]So let's go fight a fucking giant squid.
[110:55.48]Okay, am I going the right way?
[110:57.86]I'm going to go this way.
[111:00.54]All right, strap yourselves in, guys.
[111:06.26]I got a full crew.
[111:08.61]I'm taking the fucking Kraken out.
[111:18.42]It's going to be a real surprise.
[111:19.64]This is going to be scary.
[111:22.85]I'm actually going to be scared of this.
[111:24.67]If it's anything like the shark was.
[111:28.05]Oh, it's getting dark.
[111:32.35]Okay, I'm going to be in range here in about ten seconds.
[111:39.08]Corvette boat.
[111:40.82]No, it's only fast because I'm doing times four speed.
[111:45.16]Because this is going to take a long time.
[111:51.47]Here we go.
[111:52.89]If this is actually a giant squid, I hope I'm ready to fight it.
[112:00.16]Is it just a faction?
[112:01.08]We'll find out.
[112:06.58]I don't know.
[112:10.87]I don't know.
[112:12.85]I can't really move, though.
[112:15.53]I can't move.
[112:17.63]What is going on?
[112:25.50]Is it an actual monster or is it a boat?
[112:31.24]I don't understand.
[112:33.80]I don't know.
[112:38.63]Where is it?
[112:41.89]Where is this thing?
[112:48.61]I definitely don't see a boat, so... That's for sure.
[112:53.31]Ooh!
[112:55.07]It's just another shark.
[112:56.01]It's just another shark.
[112:58.21]Is it a shark?
[112:58.67]What is this thing?
[112:59.19]It's like a narwhal.
[113:01.50]It's a giant narwhal.
[113:07.72]Shit.
[113:11.02]Let's go.
[113:11.64]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[113:13.68]I gotta save this.
[113:19.61]Where'd he go?
[113:20.09]Where's the narwhal?
[113:24.67]Isn't that what that is?
[113:25.43]Do I shoot him in his face?
[113:34.49]I gotta get to the sharpshooter.
[113:35.39]I see blood.
[113:43.32]Getting narwhaled.
[113:45.06]It's too dark, dude.
[113:46.06]This sucks.
[113:47.98]Ooh!
[113:51.70]The ship's upside down.
[113:56.22]We gotta move.
[113:57.01]We just gotta move.
[113:58.05]I get the better shot.
[114:00.33]Swab the poop deck.
[114:01.21]Thank you, Croacher.
[114:01.93]Welcome back for three months, dude.
[114:04.57]I gotta get better range.
[114:05.99]I'm gonna be a monster hunter.
[114:11.13]Shoot the narwhal with your BB gun.
[114:17.07]Way to go.
[114:19.83]Let me see your big pincher.
[114:24.88]There he is.
[114:28.04]Get out of the way!
[114:29.60]No!
[114:30.00]Get out of the way!
[114:34.47]This isn't hitting him.
[114:35.21]I'm not hurting him.
[114:36.73]I gotta shoot him in the unicorn horn.
[114:38.15]That's not fucking hurting him.
[114:40.47]I just have to shoot him.
[114:48.02]I think I'm on top of them.
[114:50.00]Yep.
[114:50.32]You gotta shoot them with the cannons.
[114:57.22]I think that's the only way.
[115:02.35]Might be time for the wizard special.
[115:04.01]Aim for the eye.
[115:05.49]No, I'm gonna aim with the cannons.
[115:10.09]Turn.
[115:10.65]Turn.
[115:11.55]Turn.
[115:11.97]Turn.
[115:12.98]Turn.
[115:13.52]The boat.
[115:18.17]Ah, get fucking destroyed.
[115:19.87]Look at that, that blood.
[115:28.43]So, I'm... Tame him and ride him.
[115:36.92]That would be funny.
[115:38.50]I gotta get some distance and then do a big turn.
[115:44.20]Let's see where he pops up.
[115:47.60]Right there.
[115:53.92]Oh, I missed.
[115:59.28]I got him.
[116:01.20]Thank you, Levin94.
[116:02.36]Or Levin94.
[116:05.03]He's like half dead.
[116:06.71]I got this.
[116:10.29]Welcome to the family, Levin.
[116:12.75]And Croacher, too.
[116:13.57]How did I miss Croacher?
[116:19.47]I hit him right in his face.
[116:24.76]But thank you, Croacher, for three months.
[116:26.34]And, of course, welcome to 1194.
[116:27.22]We're gonna kill this thing, and then we're gonna go to all the blue spots.
[116:35.39]Rip around.
[116:38.25]Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[116:47.06]Nice.
[116:48.24]One or two more of those and he's done.
[116:52.86]Let the other ship aggro him.
[116:54.94]That's a funny idea.
[116:57.12]I hope, I don't know though.
[116:57.98]I feel like he's going to leave the air.
[117:05.29]I feel like if I leave this zone, he's not going to follow me.
[117:08.13]I think he'll run away or something.
[117:09.73]I don't know.
[117:10.89]But I'm in the wind.
[117:11.71]This is bad.
[117:12.17]Turn the ship.
[117:19.39]Here he comes, here he comes, here he comes.
[117:21.55]I'm gonna drive into him.
[117:22.27]I'm gonna just crash into him.
[117:30.11]My boat is fine.
[117:33.23]This ship's not even damaged.
[117:38.20]I only took, like, this thing is fucking easy.
[117:41.54]Stupid ass narwhal.
[117:46.59]This will be it right here, I think.
[117:50.29]He has... His bottom lip is not damaged.
[117:55.12]I just have to hit him in the bottom lip and he'll die.
[118:03.72]See you later.
[118:06.07]Dead, dead, dead.
[118:07.31]I win.
[118:12.05]No, I don't win.
[118:19.71]Seriously?
[118:22.35]Seriously.
[118:23.99]This stupid fucking piece of shit.
[118:30.39]I have to hit him again with the cannons.
[118:33.43]Okay.
[118:34.80]Sure.
[118:39.20]He's still alive.
[118:40.30]He has like less than a quarter of a percent of health.
[118:45.20]There he is.
[118:47.75]And you are dead.
[118:57.14]Level up.
[118:57.84]I leveled up.
[119:00.42]Oh, look at all that stuff.
[119:02.46]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[119:04.62]He dropped a shitload of stuff.
[119:05.68]That's like, I don't think that's probably going to be some rare loot in here.
[119:07.66]I'm going to get like a bunch of cool shit.
[119:14.01]What is it?
[119:14.57]Let's see.
[119:15.75]I got eight food and a behemoth horn.
[119:22.12]Don't I need to bring that somewhere?
[119:27.60]Didn't somebody need a behemoth horn?
[119:29.20]Well, whatever.
[119:29.66]We're going to fight another monster.
[119:31.56]Straight ahead.
[119:33.34]Full speed ahead.
[119:34.00]There's another monster down this way.
[119:37.42]I'm going to get a crate of used condoms.
[119:40.03]What?
[119:46.39]Alright, we're gonna go... If I look at the map, it seems to be... There's a boat here.
[119:52.09]Should I board him?
[119:58.05]What do you think?
[119:59.93]Should I board these guys?
[120:01.12]Yeah.
[120:06.48]Take it over.
[120:07.04]We're pirates.
[120:07.56]I'm not playing the good guy fucking role anymore.
[120:16.64]Take everything they have.
[120:20.72]Take everything.
[120:23.78]Yeah, wine.
[120:24.50]They have one... On the entire boat, they had one bottle of wine.
[120:36.03]Nice.
[120:37.19]Cool.
[120:39.00]That's great.
[120:40.52]Wonderful.
[120:43.66]Wonderful.
[120:44.60]Thank you for nothing.
[120:48.85]Why are you even sailing around with that?
[120:52.60]Fucking idiots.
[120:53.22]Alright, we're gonna track down this beast, whatever it is.
[121:05.80]We're gonna get a little drunk tonight.
[121:09.98]I should have scoped out how much cargo they had.
[121:12.52]Yeah, I probably should have done that.
[121:15.29]But I'm dumb.
[121:21.07]Your crew's going to have a great time watching one guy get drunk.
[121:23.67]Yeah.
[121:24.79]Let's hope it's worth it.
[121:31.55]Will the captured ships stay?
[121:32.69]I don't know.
[121:33.59]They might stay there.
[121:34.61]I'm sure they disappear, though, after you go out of the loading zone.
[121:36.77]But we're about to fight another monster.
[121:39.29]I wonder if it's going to be another narwhal.
[121:42.43]Or if it's going to be like a manatee or a shark.
[121:45.55]Hopefully it's huge, whatever it is.
[121:46.79]I want a big, big fight.
[121:50.33]And we're in its area.
[121:51.43]Let's see what it is.
[121:57.31]Come out, come out, wherever you are.
[122:05.38]Come on, where are you?
[122:09.02]Where are you?
[122:12.57]You're over here somewhere.
[122:13.83]We'll find you.
[122:17.68]Okay, whatever it is, I found it.
[122:18.94]I don't know what it is.
[122:19.78]Let's see.
[122:26.54]I'm going to laugh.
[122:27.28]It's another narwhal.
[122:30.69]Crab, kraken, shark, fish.
[122:37.61]We're going to win, Captain!
[122:41.75]It's another Megalodon.
[122:43.97]It's just another Megalodon.
[122:49.17]Although that thing was terrifying.
[122:55.33]I wish it was something else.
[122:56.07]Should I just run away?
[122:58.71]It is actually a pain in the ass to kill.
[123:05.39]You have to shoot it in the eye.
[123:10.52]Where's the other one?
[123:11.74]There's one there, too.
[123:16.91]Whoa, what the fuck is that?
[123:21.97]I can find one of those, too.
[123:23.71]Look at how many monsters.
[123:24.87]Come on.
[123:25.23]There's a guy riding a horse in the water as a monster?
[123:30.04]That's awesome.
[123:32.14]It looks like there's so many different weird monsters that you can fight.
[123:38.85]Whatever.
[123:41.52]Take out the sharpshooter.
[123:42.42]Shoot her in the fucking face.
[123:53.19]Where's that bottle of wine?
[123:54.15]Might as well drink it.
[123:55.07]I'm gonna be sitting here for a while.
[124:10.29]Oh, fuck it.
[124:12.77]He doesn't want to come out and play.
[124:14.95]And neither do I. There's another one right there.
[124:22.21]I feel like... See the smaller circles?
[124:26.85]Smaller circles might be different enemies or something.
[124:29.99]I don't know.
[124:35.36]Kill it with a narwhal horn.
[124:39.38]We're gonna go.
[124:40.83]We're leaving.
[124:41.25]We're out of here.
[124:47.57]Not fighting the Megalodon.
[124:49.41]I want to fight a new monster.
[124:50.93]It's all about the new monsters guys, not the old ones.
[124:57.01]Still in combat.
[124:59.13]Is he chasing me?
[125:00.71]I'm out of zone.
[125:07.75]He's gonna just appear next to me and just crunch on the ship, isn't he?
[125:11.59]That's gonna suck if he does.
[125:22.00]Where is he?
[125:22.42]He doesn't exist.
[125:33.55]Like, he's like back here.
[125:41.16]I'm not in combat.
[125:42.92]Why do you think I'm in combat?
[125:48.62]He's giving me the hide-and-seek Megalodon.
[125:52.81]No, no, really.
[125:53.27]He really is, like, hiding from me.
[125:57.13]Or I'm, like, running from him, but he doesn't seem to want to catch up to me.
[126:02.13]Listen, I'm going to stop to see if he actually is chasing me.
[126:06.75]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[126:13.38]I don't see him behind me.
[126:17.94]And now he left.
[126:19.58]Now he leaves me alone.
[126:20.78]What a dumbass.
[126:22.96]He probably was very close, too.
[126:27.15]Be brave, you pieces of shit.
[126:33.37]I got a feeling... Oh, fuck the wind.
[126:37.85]Next patch.
[126:38.39]Delete wind from game.
[126:45.89]So if I get into this next blue circle and it's the narwhal, then it's always going to be a narwhal, probably.
[126:56.81]Just for testing purposes.
[127:00.92]I want to see.
[127:04.34]What's in this blue circle?
[127:06.82]Is it another manatee unicorn?
[127:12.45]Hurry up, you codger!
[127:14.91]Because if it is, we're going to keep going.
[127:22.29]Flying Dutchmanship as a boss, that would be fucking awesome.
[127:24.67]It would be really cool.
[127:33.36]The final boss is Cthulhu.
[127:35.09]I'm expecting, imagine... I don't know if any devs are watching right now.
[127:39.55]I don't know why they would be, but if they are... We're talking like monsters, like huge, horrifying monsters.
[127:46.73]Like as big as the whole screen.
[127:48.56]Just like you look up and it's like Cthulhu.
[127:53.14]Oh, by the way, dev watching?
[127:54.36]Fucking fuck the wind.
[127:55.82]This is dumb.
[127:59.96]Right here.
[128:01.11]There's an orc ship here too.
[128:11.33]Yeah, I'm just speeding up time right now.
[128:13.11]So I don't... I'm not wasting time just sitting in the ocean.
[128:19.15]If there was a game... I'm not sure if this is what, like... Because this is early access still.
[128:24.38]If the whole game was pretty much just traveling around like Shadow of the Colossus.
[128:27.98]Somebody just said Shadow of the Colossus.
[128:30.18]That'd be so fun.
[128:32.12]If this game was about traversing the water and finding, like, dozens of different huge monsters to kill and, like, sell their parts and stuff.
[128:38.77]It'd be crazy.
[128:39.19]Okay.
[128:43.01]How close am I?
[128:44.77]Straight ahead.
[128:49.75]Bet the narwhal horn on double zero.
[128:53.59]Austin's 601.
[128:54.13]Welcome, Austin.
[128:56.21]Or Austin S.
[129:09.23]We will try to destroy whoever is up here if it's right here, hopefully.
[129:14.22]But thank you, welcome to the... Welcome to the fam!
[129:18.00]That's what I'm going to do from now on.
[129:18.98]Welcome to the fam!
[129:21.26]You guys are going to be like, shut up, idiot.
[129:25.60]Here we go.
[129:29.42]Is that the... That's the... It's another Megalodon.
[129:32.87]I don't want to fight another Megalodon.
[129:38.77]What's with the megalodons?
[129:41.97]It's so dark, too.
[129:42.91]This sucks.
[129:47.47]So, is the monster fighting that ship?
[129:54.05]I have no idea.
[129:55.27]We have to go this way anyways, then.
[130:00.23]Oh, it's fucking... Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.
[130:02.83]It's... What?
[130:03.35]What?
[130:03.55]What?
[130:03.71]What?
[130:03.89]What?
[130:08.40]What?
[130:09.20]What just what?
[130:10.70]Huh?
[130:14.19]What happened to the boat?
[130:15.61]What happened to the... Okay.
[130:22.16]Okay.
[130:23.62]Okay.
[130:25.02]Okay.
[130:26.00]Okay.
[130:29.54]This thing is just poking through the boat.
[130:32.54]It's right behind us.
[130:34.82]It's right behind us.
[130:39.92]Get away.
[130:40.78]Get away, foul creature.
[130:47.10]Now there's the boat.
[130:48.86]It's behind us now.
[130:49.94]It just disappeared.
[130:50.58]That was really weird.
[130:53.04]I can't really stop though.
[130:57.90]Wait, wait, we might be able to double team this.
[130:59.38]He's gonna want the narwhal tail.
[131:02.49]Okay.
[131:04.19]It's free.
[131:05.05]Go kill his boat.
[131:06.61]I'm gonna try to aggro him over there.
[131:09.29]Don't do it.
[131:09.91]Don't do it.
[131:10.37]Don't do it.
[131:10.77]Don't do it.
[131:11.63]Don't do it.
[131:20.96]It's an orc ship, isn't it?
[131:23.20]Get over here.
[131:24.16]We're gonna double team the narwhal.
[131:27.24]He's driving straight at us.
[131:29.64]He's got a big, like, meat grinder.
[131:31.78]Whoa!
[131:36.44]Damn, he's gonna... Okay.
[131:39.43]I'm gonna... What am I doing?
[131:41.59]Why am I doing that?
[131:43.15]The narwhal... I'm in... I'm on top of the narwhal.
[131:45.47]I'm riding him.
[131:47.41]We're in the air.
[131:50.45]I'm on his back.
[131:52.41]Holy shit.
[131:52.81]Uh...
[131:56.57]What do I do?
[131:57.89]How do I get off him?
[132:01.35]This is so stupid.
[132:03.95]This is fucking... Get off me!
[132:08.42]Get off me!
[132:09.80]No, shoot this way.
[132:12.22]What's the orc ship doing?
[132:14.22]He's just watching.
[132:16.00]Alright, that was a fun ride.
[132:21.06]Did I get him?
[132:23.12]No, I'm still technically on top of him.
[132:29.48]Come on.
[132:30.70]I got him lined up.
[132:31.58]I should go right up his ass.
[132:36.83]What the fuck just happened?
[132:41.13]Why?
[132:41.87]Are we being boarded?
[132:42.85]What are you doing?
[132:44.55]Do you know that there's a fucking giant narwhal that's gonna attack?
[132:47.97]Do you not understand what's going on?
[132:50.31]The situation is a little bit dire, guys.
[132:52.01]I don't know why you'd want to board.
[132:54.11]Holy shit.
[132:58.19]There's another boat over there coming.
[133:01.04]Where's the narwhal?
[133:04.02]I'm more afraid of the narwhal than anything else.
[133:07.96]Jeez.
[133:10.48]What a stupid idea.
[133:14.04]Honest to God.
[133:17.09]What a great time for us to fight.
[133:20.87]Where is the narwhal?
[133:23.91]Is he just hanging out somewhere?
[133:27.30]We kicked the shit out of these guys.
[133:29.37]Why would they do that?
[133:32.19]What was the purpose?
[133:34.95]There was no purpose.
[133:36.11]And the narwhal is just not here.
[133:37.47]He decided to leave.
[133:39.03]I'm talking diamonds.
[133:40.13]Give me them all.
[133:42.35]Alright, we're good.
[133:46.05]Where's the narwhal?
[133:46.69]I think we lost the narwhal.
[133:57.05]What the fuck?
[134:02.15]Where's that?
[134:02.93]Bring the fucking narwhal.
[134:04.05]Aggro the narwhal and destroy those things.
[134:07.07]They're fighting the... Look at this.
[134:09.63]These guys are fighting like three different ships.
[134:11.49]They're shooting over here and shooting at me.
[134:13.55]Alright, we gotta have to go over there.
[134:15.71]We gotta deal with that.
[134:17.46]We're gonna have to go over there, guys.
[134:19.46]We're taking a detour.
[134:24.26]Quick detour.
[134:28.82]Wait a second.
[134:30.90]Oh, Jesus!
[134:36.41]Is that, is it the, I think the Nagual's over there, isn't it?
[134:38.67]Yep.
[134:39.23]Look at it.
[134:39.85]It's over there fighting that ship.
[134:42.53]It's been over there this whole time.
[134:44.95]What is it doing?
[134:46.67]What the fuck is happening?
[134:52.06]He's just, is he with that boat?
[134:56.70]He's hanging out with this orc ship.
[135:01.59]Whoa.
[135:02.95]They're shooting their Graspers.
[135:07.10]Look at this.
[135:10.20]He's part of this boat.
[135:13.58]I feel like this shouldn't be happening.
[135:17.01]Okay.
[135:17.69]Here we go.
[135:22.79]Boom.
[135:24.83]Board the ship.
[135:26.74]board the narwhal ship wow fuck me what's happening what the f- board board board board board that's a lot of people and the narwhal's right here too oh god I'm like so scared
[135:57.72]There's so many people.
[135:58.76]There's too many hearts.
[136:03.60]Oh, God.
[136:11.26]Shit.
[136:12.03]No.
[136:12.93]No, I'm dead.
[136:15.63]We lose.
[136:17.67]Fuck.
[136:23.77]Fuck, fuck.
[136:24.63]No, shit.
[136:33.35]Well, this is the last autosave.
[136:34.81]I believe it was right before that.
[136:36.33]Fuck.
[136:38.97]Where are we?
[136:40.27]Yeah, this is right before we get there.
[136:43.49]Let's just go.
[136:44.77]Fucking rip.
[136:46.75]God damn it.
[136:48.73]I didn't know there was going to be that many orcs on that ship.
[136:52.47]Thank you, P-Man or Pie-Man.
[136:54.47]Welcome back for five months.
[136:59.28]Thank you, Piemann.
[137:03.15]That was intense, though.
[137:06.29]What was... The narwhal was just hanging out inside of his ship.
[137:10.23]Yeah, we're going to skip.
[137:10.89]We're not... That was a fucking mess.
[137:13.69]That was a total mess.
[137:15.33]I don't want to do that again.
[137:19.51]That was pretty funny, though.
[137:23.24]Monster hunter germa fails again well to my credit the narwhal decided to like be a part of that person ship Yeah, the orc ships are amazing.
[137:35.85]I wish I could use one So we're gonna go we're gonna go straight through here and We're gonna try to end up over here for this monster That's the theory
[137:56.07]I wonder if you can eventually end up purchasing one.
[137:58.89]That'd be cool.
[138:06.46]Alright, I've been playing for a little more than two or three hours now.
[138:13.04]I'll give you my assessment of the game.
[138:18.19]Really, really interesting idea.
[138:19.57]Really cool concept.
[138:21.39]I love the chaos that can just happen on the seas.
[138:26.68]It's still in early access?
[138:27.66]I mean, I think it... If... Here we go.
[138:30.90]Here's the assessment.
[138:31.86]If there are more than, like, eight monsters, like, big, huge, scary monsters in the game, and they continue to add content, and they get, you know, delete the fucking wind, you know?
[138:43.85]Because, like, I can't... I now have to, like, turn around.
[138:47.69]Ugh.
[138:50.19]Oh, my God.
[138:56.58]Let's see.
[139:03.25]I think it's a pretty solid fun game.
[139:08.67]I'm not sure.
[139:09.29]It depends on how... If you like trading, like going from port to port and trading, you'd probably like it.
[139:18.24]But, I don't know.
[139:19.30]I feel like it's just... I need that on the ground.
[139:23.88]The boarding ships is cool.
[139:24.87]I wish you could take ships.
[139:25.75]I wish you could, like, pillage ships.
[139:27.59]I don't know.
[139:28.49]I'm just not sure.
[139:33.43]It's definitely... I mean, it's kept my attention for the last few hours, that's for sure.
[139:36.63]And if they're going to add more content, then, yeah.
[139:42.99]And if there are a bunch of monsters, if it's not just a bunch of narwhals, then, yeah, the game's fun.
[139:50.95]Because what I'm doing right now, just this monster hunting aspect, is interesting enough to me.
[140:03.66]Oh, here we are.
[140:04.25]Let's see what it is.
[140:10.28]Start a fleet.
[140:10.86]Yeah, if you could... There's a whole lot of things I wish... Oh no, we already did this, but... Let's see if it's the narwhal again.
[140:26.78]Is it a different monster?
[140:28.90]Is it just random?
[140:32.14]Uh, let's see.
[140:44.71]What is it?
[140:47.35]That's the narwhal again.
[140:52.25]He's just destroying ships.
[141:01.79]Oh fuck, not this again.
[141:06.09]Not this again, I'm in the wind too.
[141:09.53]And here comes the meat grinder.
[141:13.81]Fuck off.
[141:19.53]Nice.
[141:22.05]Come on over here.
[141:23.47]I need a sniper rifle.
[141:36.32]Kermit.
[141:40.41]Shit.
[141:41.23]Not a headshot.
[141:44.11]Oh, there he is.
[141:45.17]Oh, hey, I just wanted to ask you a question.
[141:53.18]You care if I come over and take a look at your boat?
[141:56.76]You know, it'd be like a pretty cool boat you got here.
[141:58.56]Oh, sorry.
[142:04.58]Come on, kill it.
[142:05.80]Oh, we got a couple of gems.
[142:09.78]He's going after that boat.
[142:13.74]Don't.
[142:14.98]Don't do it.
[142:16.44]Don't do it.
[142:17.86]Oh, God.
[142:18.76]Oh, no.
[142:20.28]Here he comes.
[142:21.02]Hey, what are you guys doing over there?
[142:25.06]You guys playing board the ship?
[142:26.36]That's my favorite game.
[142:27.08]Where'd he go?
[142:31.00]Where's the birdie?
[142:31.90]What?
[142:36.32]No, don't fucking kill me again.
[142:38.42]No, I'm gonna die again.
[142:45.15]Barely.
[142:45.99]Just barely.
[142:50.45]Protect your captain.
[142:56.08]Boy.
[142:57.18]We did it.
[142:57.76]Okay.
[142:59.42]Free wine.
[143:00.03]Great.
[143:00.91]Get us.
[143:04.95]The behemoth just goes away?
[143:10.68]And now I'm stuck on this stupid boat.
[143:12.82]I'm gonna get hit right in the head with one of these and die.
[143:16.36]Get me out of here.
[143:19.33]Oh!
[143:21.45]Bye, bye, bye.
[143:22.25]See ya.
[143:22.77]Leave.
[143:25.95]Goodbye.
[143:26.69]Get us out.
[143:27.17]He shot a crewman.
[143:30.81]I kind of wish you could play as the narwhal.
[143:32.05]That would be awesome.
[143:32.73]I'm so fucking dead here.
[143:34.83]Look at this.
[143:35.95]I'm just sitting.
[143:37.09]Where's the narwhal?
[143:37.79]Get over there and fight for me.
[143:39.41]Help me.
[143:42.04]This thing is just... Look at how big this is.
[143:45.36]What am I supposed to do about this?
[143:47.34]I'm dead.
[143:51.00]All I can do is just hope I can get enough speed.
[143:52.50]But one of my sails is gone.
[143:55.80]Where is the narwhal?
[143:56.84]Get over there and fight.
[143:58.42]Attack it.
[143:59.56]He's taking out my other sail.
[144:00.92]I'm just going to be a rowboat here in a few seconds.
[144:04.60]All we can do is fight.
[144:06.92]That's all I can do.
[144:09.45]Do you see how much damage I just did?
[144:13.09]The answer to that question is zero.
[144:16.09]I must not be able to attack this boat.
[144:19.95]I did like 5% damage.
[144:22.05]He's throwing giant rocks at me.
[144:25.58]Gonna have to make these all count.
[144:26.70]Come on.
[144:30.83]No, it's only doing like 10%.
[144:34.63]Thankfully, he's missing as much as... What is he doing?
[144:37.39]Ooh!
[144:41.58]Ooh!
[144:43.38]He almost just grabbed me.
[144:44.46]That's what he was trying to do.
[144:46.54]This boat is so big.
[144:49.00]Oh shit, here he comes.
[144:51.02]He's gonna grab me.
[144:52.34]He's gonna grab me.
[144:53.94]He's gonna grab me.
[144:55.50]He's gonna grab me.
[144:56.70]Kill him before he gets Senka before they get here.
[145:00.52]Oh, he's at 50%.
[145:01.02]Snipe him.
[145:03.56]Snipe him.
[145:04.96]Snipe him.
[145:14.83]Where are we going?
[145:16.71]What's happening?
[145:17.27]Where are we going?
[145:20.89]Jesus.
[145:24.31]Where's their boat?
[145:29.20]Oh, they grabbed us.
[145:32.10]That doesn't seem like a good idea.
[145:33.84]Why are you doing it this way?
[145:37.64]We're inside of their boat now.
[145:40.02]They grabbed us into the boat.
[145:42.74]This is not something that I think should be happening.
[145:44.88]I don't think this is how boats are being grabbed works.
[145:49.20]I could tell you, but this is a good place for me just to get free kills.
[145:56.60]Oh my god.
[145:59.72]What the fuck is going on?
[146:03.88]This is outrageous.
[146:05.62]The people are...
[146:10.17]Am I actually gonna win because of this?
[146:13.56]They gotta be kidding me.
[146:17.52]Just... How many crewmen do they have?
[146:24.21]What happened?
[146:25.95]What's going on?
[146:38.90]Damn it, I thought I had that.
[146:40.26]Damn it, damn it, damn it.
[146:41.24]I really thought I had it.
[146:42.04]Fuck.
[146:48.79]And the narwhal just leaves.
[146:50.17]Did they kill the narwhal?
[146:51.15]I don't understand.
[146:54.19]That was so dumb.
[147:01.36]Third death.
[147:05.35]Yeah, alright.
[147:06.17]We're just making a break for it.
[147:07.65]Just speed by him.
[147:09.19]I want nothing to do with it.
[147:10.09]The narwhal never helps.
[147:13.23]We never get helped by the narwhal.
[147:17.41]He always shows up and then when a fight happens he leaves.
[147:19.56]I was taking damage from the giant claw.
[147:30.36]I'm gonna go down and then... I'm down far enough.
[147:35.62]Refine the ship.
[147:36.34]Yeah, I could get some upgrades.
[147:38.46]I need more money.
[147:40.20]It's so fun to get into fights, though.
[147:51.01]Maybe the next monster isn't a narwhal.
[147:53.73]That's the hope.
[147:55.45]The narwhal seems to be the dumbest out of them all.
[148:00.96]There's a port up here.
[148:04.00]I'm just going to repair.
[148:04.80]Oh my god, the fucking wind.
[148:18.36]Okay, mark it.
[148:24.13]Norton's been ravaged by war.
[148:25.57]That doesn't sound great.
[148:27.67]No, I don't want to buy your dumb ship.
[148:29.61]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[148:33.48]What do I have?
[148:34.00]I picked up gems, right?
[148:41.28]Did I?
[148:41.52]I thought I did.
[148:44.32]No, that was because I raided.
[148:45.36]You know, that's so... Look at how much these are worth.
[148:47.24]These are worth so much.
[148:49.67]Damn.
[148:51.93]Don't really have much of anything.
[148:53.27]Let's sell some food.
[148:57.45]Let's sell a little bit of food.
[149:02.61]Courier service.
[149:08.91]Purchase ship.
[149:09.55]So... I want that one.
[149:14.31]It's like a giant rowboat of death.
[149:18.31]But I have to pee.
[149:20.19]So I'm gonna put this on the screen.
[149:22.09]Getting some tea.
[149:23.57]I'll be right back, guys.
[149:24.45]I gotta use the bathroom.
[149:26.87]Be back in like two minutes.
[149:36.61]Thanks for watching!
[150:08.95]Thank you.
[151:15.15]Thank you.
[151:57.43]yo what's up it's like being at niagara falls or what let's head back up I don't have enough
[152:21.37]Where am I in the world?
[152:24.07]War.
[152:25.27]So I'm assuming if you're in war, then like weapons would be what you want to purchase.
[152:32.80]I guess.
[152:36.86]It's a lot of fucking money.
[152:42.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[152:45.93]Crew, crew.
[152:47.05]Do I have full crew?
[152:47.95]I do.
[152:50.43]I wonder when you can actually... Can you get any more crew members or any more sharpshooters?
[152:53.99]I wish you could.
[152:58.45]Whatever.
[152:58.75]I'm prepared.
[152:59.77]I have a full crew.
[153:00.60]I just want to go monster hunting.
[153:03.86]That's all I care about.
[153:06.06]Let's go.
[153:09.22]Times four speed.
[153:11.58]Get us up there.
[153:22.47]Speaking of grog.
[153:28.40]Good grog.
[153:34.58]This time I'm not going to get involved with the stupid nonsense up north.
[153:41.35]Just want to go around to the other monster.
[153:50.68]The bathroom is where I'm most proud of.
[153:58.79]Alright, now I can turn.
[154:00.07]The dumb red marker is gone.
[154:01.69]Shit.
[154:07.17]Captain?
[154:18.08]Oh, I can just let go?
[154:18.98]I didn't realize I could even do that.
[154:24.00]That's funny.
[154:26.24]Search.
[154:28.18]Searching.
[154:31.18]Wait a second.
[154:32.68]Maybe I can do that right... Yeah, I can do that over here.
[154:35.14]Hold on.
[154:35.66]Didn't know you had to actually do that.
[154:39.29]Search.
[154:42.91]This is the spot I had to go to.
[154:50.95]Right here.
[154:51.33]This is the spot, right?
[155:01.21]Oh my god.
[155:03.67]Just roll the dice if your ship's gonna be able to move in a direction or not.
[155:06.97]That's what the wind is in this game.
[155:13.46]Okay.
[155:16.70]So, theoretically now, if I do search, wouldn't it do something here now?
[155:24.90]Didn't find anything.
[155:27.52]Are you sure about that?
[155:33.56]We found it.
[155:34.94]Got it.
[155:36.92]Captain, we found a long lost treasure chest.
[155:38.62]A thousand gold.
[155:39.40]Okay, thank you.
[155:42.26]Got it.
[155:42.54]Except that wasn't even it.
[155:49.63]I'm stuck again.
[155:56.93]Get off the fucking rock.
[155:58.87]You idiots.
[156:00.37]You idiot.
[156:03.17]Get off the rock, you idiot.
[156:04.44]I don't understand what you're supposed to do here.
[156:13.10]I really don't.
[156:14.70]But I'll take a thousand dollars.
[156:16.50]Search right here, too.
[156:18.89]Didn't find anything.
[156:19.53]What if I just keep doing this?
[156:23.85]Is it just like 1 in 100 you actually find something worth taking?
[156:26.49]Oops.
[156:33.35]Drive!
[156:35.59]Drive!
[156:39.42]Whatever.
[156:39.74]Just keep on moving.
[156:52.82]Alright, I want to avoid that and we're going to go straight to this monster.
[156:56.94]So put a waypoint right there.
[157:04.64]Yeah, so far we've seen an Arwal and a Megalodon.
[157:08.18]Hopefully, there are others.
[157:12.62]Someone didn't have their seatbelt on.
[157:13.78]Nobody has a seatbelt on.
[157:16.02]I'm shocked they've been able to stay on this boat.
[157:27.74]Over there.
[157:28.10]Let's take a look into the search feature.
[157:46.49]Can identify it or anything?
[157:50.93]Anything in here?
[157:51.45]Didn't find anything, come on.
[157:56.95]Come on.
[157:57.51]Really?
[157:58.07]It's like a broken down ship.
[158:01.03]I keep doing that.
[158:02.37]These poor crewmen.
[158:05.41]I'm so bad at driving around.
[158:07.07]Right into the wind.
[158:10.10]I get this out of my face.
[158:18.86]Almost halfway there.
[158:19.60]Might as well save it.
[158:20.47]Let's go.
[158:21.91]Whoa!
[158:34.97]Are you worried that the cat police might arrest you?
[158:38.93]No, I'll be fine.
[158:46.19]Well, good luck, Evaze.
[158:48.09]Is that your name?
[158:48.59]Evaze the First.
[158:49.99]Thanks for hanging out.
[158:54.10]They scream after they fall down.
[158:55.92]Yeah, they do.
[159:00.13]Keep your eyes on the water.
[159:01.19]It doesn't really do much.
[159:03.63]Doesn't seem to be that big of a deal.
[159:08.96]Don't sail and text.
[159:10.18]Yeah, don't text and sail.
[159:11.92]You'll end up getting hurt.
[159:13.68]You'll end up getting smoked.
[159:21.22]I just saw this Smarty just hosted.
[159:24.12]Thanks for hosting, Smarty.
[159:27.73]Thanks for the host, dude.
[159:29.13]Welcome.
[159:29.75]Welcome to the stream.
[159:33.01]Is this a wall?
[159:34.45]If I keep going this way, am I going to run into a wall?
[159:37.37]I don't get it.
[159:38.09]Let's find out.
[159:42.19]Yeah, I'm at x4 speed.
[159:43.45]I feel like people are going to come here that haven't been watching or anything and just be like, what the fuck is going on?
[159:50.94]He's moving very fast.
[159:54.22]Oh, sundown.
[159:57.01]Sundown guns out suns out guns out sundown guns out Fucking sundown moons out goons out fucking suns out guns out moons out goons out Keep going Behold the great ocean wall
[160:28.82]Look at the mini-map.
[160:29.59]We're about to go over some wooden paneling.
[160:34.91]Okay.
[160:38.61]Let's go.
[160:41.61]We're crossing it.
[160:45.72]It's crossable.
[160:51.38]Duh.
[160:55.86]Do you guess the map just hasn't been finished or something?
[160:57.92]I don't know.
[161:00.71]Save.
[161:01.11]It's stupid.
[161:09.09]I hate it.
[161:10.17]I hate it.
[161:10.73]I hate it.
[161:11.23]I hate this win.
[161:12.87]I hate it.
[161:14.82]It's just a... I'm going to complain again.
[161:16.86]It's just a hindrance that doesn't need to be in the game.
[161:18.66]You're going to have wind, but does it have to slow you down to 0%?
[161:22.88]Like, I don't care about the wind.
[161:24.68]It doesn't... Just take... Just delete it.
[161:27.19]And fucking replace it with something else.
[161:29.85]It's just a hindrance that doesn't need to be there.
[161:32.41]I'm going to freak out.
[161:33.53]I just freaked out.
[161:34.17]You saw it.
[161:41.57]It seems to be raining harder on the wooden paneling.
[161:49.46]We're almost here to this, whatever monster this is.
[161:56.47]Hopefully it's a big one.
[161:57.55]Google Maps.
[162:08.57]Getting closer.
[162:09.19]I'm going to save it right before we get in.
[162:19.09]Here comes the fight.
[162:20.19]I just wish there wasn't wind over there so I could drive my boat Okay, save it and say your prayers Let's go enter the fray
[162:45.57]Alright, I'm hoping for a Kraken.
[162:48.13]Or a giant worm.
[162:52.09]Or... Uh... The Cthulhu.
[163:00.25]There's this wind over there.
[163:01.60]I have to keep turning.
[163:05.44]Here comes the sounds, the music.
[163:08.40]There's an orc ship.
[163:09.44]You know what happens when there's an orc ship around.
[163:14.18]Oh my God.
[163:16.45]Oh my God.
[163:18.13]Yeah.
[163:19.77]No.
[163:21.19]Why?
[163:23.19]Why, Wind?
[163:24.19]Why?
[163:24.61]What monster is it?
[163:27.93]Give us something different.
[163:30.03]Give us a new monster.
[163:34.34]It's a fucking narwhal.
[163:41.18]Here it goes.
[163:42.95]Just let him fight, who cares?
[163:45.47]Is he coming this way now?
[163:46.85]Is he being fair?
[163:47.57]I think he's being fair about this.
[163:50.90]He wants to fight us both.
[164:15.04]It's another one of these giant things gonna grab me again He's gonna grab me and he's gonna destroy me and I'm gonna get bad again.
[164:26.56]Here it comes He's gonna turn he's gonna do the rob from Nintendo.
[164:28.94]He's gonna go I didn't his arms are gonna come down and go forward Fuck we're being bored.
[164:34.40]We're being bored.
[164:35.02]I think he's got a hammer on the front.
[164:36.91]Let's go.
[164:37.25]Let's go I'm gonna take him out this time This time I'm gonna be ready
[164:49.79]Where is that guy?
[164:50.51]That guy's climbing.
[164:53.24]That guy climbed up the pole.
[165:02.06]Only got four crew members left.
[165:08.00]Protect your captain!
[165:10.10]Protect me!
[165:14.55]Oh my god, I'm gonna die again.
[165:16.41]There's so many of them.
[165:18.27]It's over.
[165:18.71]I'm gonna fucking load the goddamn game.
[165:20.77]And the narwhal didn't even do anything.
[165:26.45]Well, it was a narwhal.
[165:27.94]Don't worry.
[165:31.28]At least we're right here.
[165:32.72]Alright, we'll skip that one too.
[165:36.80]Where's the next one?
[165:38.04]Over here?
[165:38.70]What is that?
[165:41.02]Whatever this is, we're going to it.
[165:47.57]See you next week.
[165:48.27]See you next week.
[165:48.85]Yeah, thanks, a narwhal.
[165:49.81]You can do anything.
[165:56.45]There should be about nine monsters in the game.
[165:59.07]There was nine in the board game version.
[166:00.61]Oh, that's cool.
[166:03.14]I just drove right into it again.
[166:04.72]Fuck it.
[166:05.06]I'm just not even... Oh, no.
[166:05.92]Maybe it's a narwhal again.
[166:10.48]It's definitely going to be a narwhal.
[166:13.22]Where is he?
[166:13.72]Where's the narwhal that's going to appear and hit him once...
[166:27.97]Two darwals?
[166:36.36]Two of them?
[166:37.80]We're just speeding up.
[166:41.04]Go.
[166:47.62]The world is like changing around me.
[166:49.85]This guy's way too powerful for me.
[166:51.83]I just have to drive by him.
[166:58.22]He's faster than me too.
[166:59.70]Wait.
[167:00.32]He's just gonna kill me.
[167:04.44]The boat is faster.
[167:05.36]He's a giant warship.
[167:07.14]Fuck me.
[167:10.99]Thanks a lot, Oatmeal Man.
[167:12.49]It's a rip-off of Raven's Cry.
[167:16.19]Everything's a rip-off of Raven's Cry.
[167:17.39]Oh, there he is.
[167:18.99]He's gonna help me.
[167:20.57]Actually kill him.
[167:21.39]Actually attack him, Narwhal.
[167:23.85]You need to be my savior.
[167:26.53]Good job.
[167:28.05]Flip him.
[167:30.96]He's spamming these rocks at me.
[167:33.42]I can't even drive.
[167:37.08]Stupid fucking narwhal.
[167:39.32]This narwhal sucks.
[167:40.76]We're dead.
[167:41.46]They just, they grabbed us.
[167:48.25]What?
[167:52.45]What the hell?
[167:56.38]They went to the other side.
[167:58.03]Alright, there's an R wall.
[168:00.65]I'm waiting.
[168:01.09]God damn it.
[168:11.20]God damn it.
[168:14.70]Okay, I need to avoid that.
[168:16.74]That guy's way too powerful.
[168:19.58]I wish I had a better companion.
[168:29.03]Alright.
[168:30.53]Okay.
[168:31.51]Skip it.
[168:32.19]Go that way.
[168:32.89]We're gonna get to another monster.
[168:37.02]Destroy.
[168:37.64]I just got fucking annihilated.
[168:43.36]Go get a better ship.
[168:44.20]I know, but I'm so addicted to finding monsters.
[168:46.20]What's going on?
[168:50.49]I'm not even in.
[168:52.71]What the fuck?
[168:54.49]From that far away?
[168:55.53]Are you shitting me right now?
[169:00.63]I wasn't even in his, like, range.
[169:02.31]Get me out of here.
[169:09.98]Get me out of here.
[169:14.02]Not while incoming.
[169:19.40]This stupid rock machine.
[169:23.40]I'll get away this time.
[169:29.09]Yeah, I'll get away this time Excuse me, but I'm gonna get away this time motherfucker Shut up
[169:43.58]There it is!
[169:44.18]There it is!
[169:44.76]There it is!
[169:47.12]Hey, look!
[169:47.52]It's me again!
[169:49.20]Hey, do you remember when I did this to you that one time?
[169:51.40]I went up and I was like, yes, yeah?
[169:52.94]I'm gonna do it again.
[169:54.10]Okay, bye!
[169:58.92]He does it every time!
[170:02.42]He runs up and hits him once.
[170:04.38]And then leaves.
[170:05.02]He does it every single time.
[170:07.76]And then he disappears.
[170:08.41]He doesn't want to be part of the fight anymore.
[170:12.47]No, there he is again.
[170:15.39]Hey, remember me?
[170:17.09]I'm the catwalk.
[170:18.66]Hey, shh, shh, shh.
[170:20.48]Don't tell anybody, but I'm going to do this.
[170:21.86]We're by the way.
[170:24.74]Yeah.
[170:29.40]It's like a little kid playing tag.
[170:33.44]He's going to keep doing that.
[170:34.34]I think he's going to watch.
[170:39.43]But there he is.
[170:43.78]Remember when I did this shit one time?
[170:46.00]I'm gonna do it again.
[170:47.12]Here it comes.
[170:48.24]I'm gonna do it.
[170:54.21]Get me the fuck out of here.
[170:57.19]Somebody just subbed.
[171:08.80]Gildash, thank you for your subscription.
[171:11.39]He's doing it again.
[171:13.29]Why won't they fight him?
[171:15.93]You'd think that they would fight him.
[171:18.01]But no, of course not.
[171:25.43]Fine, you two have fun.
[171:29.70]Welcome, though.
[171:30.16]Thank you, too.
[171:30.82]Thanks to you for your subscription.
[171:32.26]Appreciate it.
[171:36.10]Oh, man.
[171:37.04]We're almost at the next boss fight.
[171:38.50]I don't know what this means.
[171:42.01]Maybe that's like a ghost ship.
[171:43.45]Let's move.
[171:46.03]Save.
[171:46.41]I don't want to have to deal with that shit again.
[171:50.94]Is this online?
[171:51.62]No, it is not.
[171:53.33]This is a single-player game, early access.
[171:56.87]It's by the... I think it says... It has the Games Workshop license, so it's based off of Manowar Corsair.
[172:04.57]I don't know if the Corsair is important, but... Manowar.
[172:12.78]The map is huge.
[172:14.50]Which is why... I really hope... Because look at just how gigantic this game is.
[172:22.01]It's absolutely enormous.
[172:25.69]I really hope there's not just, like, narwhals, you know?
[172:29.31]If it's a bunch of narwhals, then that seems like a waste of a gigantic, like, 200-mile map.
[172:40.02]But I'm sure we'll find out.
[172:46.50]Most of that is ocean.
[172:47.31]But yeah, look at all the ports, though.
[172:48.49]There's, like...
[172:50.16]So many ports.
[172:51.88]Look at how many places there are to go.
[172:53.44]And there's these, like, I'm assuming this is early access.
[172:56.64]They're not.
[172:56.94]Well, actually, they are here.
[172:57.72]There's so much area to explore.
[173:04.53]Better not be narwhals.
[173:05.47]Tie off those ropes!
[173:12.73]Wind change.
[173:15.79]The ports are all UI screens.
[173:18.87]Yeah, but come on.
[173:20.21]We're not... Ashley, we're narwhal hunting.
[173:22.29]Isn't that important?
[173:30.15]We're almost there.
[173:30.70]Just another few hundred knots.
[173:35.88]Is this a friendly ship?
[173:39.02]No?
[173:39.68]Yes.
[173:40.92]Back to work!
[173:44.67]Yeah, I ran away from the last one because I didn't want to fight that narwhal.
[173:47.59]Because that narwhal was too close to a orc ship that has killed me five times in a row.
[173:54.26]If the narwhal wasn't next to that giant death machine, then I would have fought it.
[173:57.96]It would have been a fair fight.
[174:05.46]Save it.
[174:19.09]Cheesy Fiesta Blend.
[174:32.17]Now that is making me hungry.
[174:34.85]Thank you, Cheesy Fiesta Blend.
[174:36.41]Welcome.
[174:37.81]Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.
[174:40.55]We are about to be in the ghost ship.
[174:42.25]I'm assuming it's a ghost ship.
[174:43.23]Why wouldn't it be?
[174:46.36]Oh, boy.
[174:46.72]That's a ghost ship.
[174:47.56]That's a ghost ship.
[174:49.14]Right?
[174:51.35]It's a ghost ship.
[174:56.97]What am I doing?
[174:59.21]What am I doing?
[175:02.89]Oh, shit.
[175:03.53]Okay.
[175:04.52]No.
[175:04.86]Is it a ghost ship?
[175:07.68]I don't know what the hell that is.
[175:10.42]But I...
[175:13.44]I hope it's not like a powerful boat.
[175:16.24]I'd be sad if it is.
[175:17.20]Just a pirate ship.
[175:23.74]I hit almost every one of those.
[175:26.79]And it didn't do anything to him.
[175:28.49]I'm in such a bad spot.
[175:29.43]I'm in like a little dumb shit boat.
[175:31.43]And I'm trying to fight these giant... Yeah, bye.
[175:34.13]See ya.
[175:35.41]Goodbye.

[176:38.30]Good call.
[176:39.32]That's a good call.
[176:42.80]It's going to be a Kraken.
[176:44.05]I can't wait.
[176:46.69]We're going to get destroyed by a giant Kraken.
[176:49.37]It's going to be intense.
[176:50.59]This guy's stretching.
[176:51.61]Stop stretching.
[176:52.23]There's a fight going on.
[176:55.35]Alright.
[176:56.66]Here we go.
[176:57.50]Here we go.
[177:00.74]We're almost in the depths where the Kraken's going to get us.
[177:05.85]Hope you guys are ready.
[177:06.70]Here we go.
[177:10.80]I'm scared.
[177:18.02]I'm actually kind of scared, I'm not going to lie.
[177:21.01]I'm like freaking out.
[177:21.85]I don't know what it's going to be.
[177:24.83]The anticipation of the monster is the best part.
[177:31.40]We're in the monster's waters.
[177:32.82]Where is he?
[177:33.54]What is it?
[177:36.41]Ow.
[177:40.77]Yeah, we have been looking for a good... That's a fucking narwhal.
[177:48.25]That's a narwhal, guys.
[177:51.71]He came all this way.
[177:56.91]Oh, hi!
[177:59.73]Fucking break.
[178:03.31]Give me a break.
[178:06.85]Well, at least I'll destroy this ship.
[178:23.28]Watch out for the...
[178:26.99]Oh god, he's just flying through the ship.
[178:30.35]Okay.
[178:32.23]I'm sure that makes sense.
[178:34.57]Are we gonna die here?
[178:40.31]No, we're not, right?
[178:48.72]That guy got like too caught up in what was happening.
[178:52.99]I don't know what's going on.
[178:54.41]This is fucking war.
[178:56.25]War is hell.
[179:02.62]What the fuck just happened?
[179:04.18]That guy fell over.
[179:18.44]That guy fell over.
[179:25.51]And the ship exploded I think you got like stabbed, but you got back stabbed by the first mate and then the ship blew up Come on, I'm not going I want to see another monster Please give me anything else
[179:52.58]I would honestly take a Megalodon.
[179:53.86]The Megalodon was crazy.
[179:57.14]The Narwhal is, like, lame.
[179:58.22]Mutiny.
[179:58.48]Well, thank you, criminy fist in me.
[180:01.43]For your subscription.
[180:05.35]Appreciate it.
[180:09.11]Thank you.
[180:20.22]Ladies and gentlemen, here comes a narwhal.
[180:24.14]Watch out.
[180:26.92]He's scary.
[180:27.87]Oh, no.
[180:34.15]There's the narwhal.
[180:39.53]Look out.
[180:44.38]Show yourself.
[180:44.92]Come on.
[180:47.91]Be anything but the narwhal I just do there are people that didn't see the shark in the very beginning I'd love for them to be able to see the Megalodon because it was cool.
[180:56.05]It was like jaws We need more cordage That's just toying with me narwhal nation
[181:14.58]Oh, where's the next monster spot?
[181:16.34]Right there.
[181:16.74]All right, let's go.
[181:19.88]Get us out of this.
[181:23.83]We know this is a narwhal spot.
[181:27.13]We don't need to be told again.
[181:28.17]All right, let's go.
[181:34.51]Swamp the guy!
[181:44.78]I think I just saw it.
[181:45.42]No, I didn't.
[181:47.30]I lied.
[181:52.66]This is fun, though.
[181:56.90]It's gonna be another narwhal.
[181:59.78]You see, we're getting so hyped up from narwhals that this next one is going to be a kraken, and it's gonna be fucking crazy.
[182:09.93]Unless, because it's early access, there's really two monsters in the game.
[182:15.07]And that would be funny that we were just driving around looking for them.
[182:21.29]That would be pretty funny.
[182:23.05]Considering how much time we spent trying to go around.
[182:29.32]Okay, we're almost there.
[182:31.52]But look at this thing.
[182:33.62]This thing is fucked.
[182:36.40]I want... Seriously, I want the seahorse Santa Claus spearman.
[182:42.24]Give me the old Roman Santa with the seahorse body.
[182:47.53]That'd be so cool.
[182:48.29]Nice, fresh, clean open air.
[183:01.18]It's gonna be a Kraken.
[183:02.78]I hope so.
[183:03.22]We need some more variety.
[183:11.69]Go towards the narwhal drawing on the map.
[183:15.13]How far out am I?
[183:15.96]God, this is like fucking so fucking far away.
[183:18.60]Okay, here we go.
[183:26.98]Cross your fingers.
[183:34.13]Cross your fingers.
[183:37.03]That is not an arwal.
[183:40.37]Whatever it is, we're in its waters.
[183:45.92]Oh, it's a giant sea turtle.
[183:53.78]Keep your eyes out.
[183:57.12]Keep your eyes peeled.
[183:59.35]I can feel it.
[184:02.65]Okay.
[184:03.97]What is it?
[184:06.55]What is it?
[184:17.30]Come on.
[184:23.90]Come on.
[184:26.34]Ugh.
[184:58.59]Fuck you fucking narwhal I just want to go- I don't even want to fight it.
[185:07.07]I don't even want to fight this dumb thing It's only narwhals.
[185:12.97]What the hell is this?
[185:15.79]I mean this- we've gone through like five different spots Last attempt
[185:24.71]Imagine if we could fight that thing.
[185:25.97]How fun would that be?
[185:27.21]What if we were under attack?
[185:29.08]Yeah, I know.
[185:33.26]You think I know?
[185:39.80]Ugh.
[185:43.32]Were you excited when you saw the first narwhal?
[185:45.11]Yeah, I was.
[185:47.73]Kill it.
[185:48.03]It's one less narwhal to deal with.
[185:51.59]No, at this point I just feel bad.
[185:54.90]I just feel bad for the fucking poor bastard.
[186:00.52]There's one monster that I haven't seen, but I want to see it.
[186:02.72]I want to see the monster.
[186:05.20]Because the monsters are fucking cool.
[186:06.52]It's not just narwhals.
[186:16.39]The other monster is the black leviathan.
[186:18.89]Sounds fucking cool.
[186:20.09]I'd love to see it.
[186:26.88]Okay, Narwhal.
[186:28.60]Now you pissed me off.
[186:29.42]I didn't want to have to do this, but you just really pissed me off there.
[186:34.04]I'm actually mad at you now.
[186:35.75]You were like a funny, dumb, cute Kermit the Frog fucking lookalike.
[186:38.75]Bullshit.
[186:39.71]Now you're dead.
[186:41.01]I'm just going to kill it.
[186:42.35]And I'm going to take his stupid horn and sell it on eBay.
[186:46.53]Whoa!
[186:47.79]I shot him!
[186:48.57]I just shot him.
[186:49.25]He didn't typically do that.
[186:50.65]He's under the boat.
[186:51.31]Fuck.
[186:57.79]I'm going to die.
[187:02.69]He's going to kill me.
[187:05.06]I'm going to turn.
[187:11.00]Now it's raining and shit.
[187:19.49]Hit him!
[187:26.47]Punk.
[187:30.92]I mean, I already killed one of the narwhals.
[187:32.26]You'd think I would know that I killed one.
[187:36.22]Oh, whatever.
[187:36.68]He's half dead.
[187:38.14]Another one of those.
[187:46.36]Keep flying, I dare ya.
[187:48.95]Got a little closer.
[187:49.81]There we go.
[187:50.49]About that far.
[187:50.95]Did that not hit him?
[187:55.57]Yeah.
[187:55.87]He's gonna be right here.
[187:57.49]No?
[187:59.49]There he is.
[188:02.96]One more and he's dead.
[188:03.86]I so badly want to find the Leviathan.
[188:09.54]I'd love to.
[188:10.18]Where'd he go?
[188:16.57]What's going on?
[188:21.13]Oh my god.
[188:21.83]Fucking wind.
[188:24.90]He just ran away?
[188:30.66]Oh my god, that's so dumb.
[188:33.00]So I... Because I... He better not have... If he has full health, I swear to god I'm gonna throw up in my mouth.
[188:45.51]I will seriously throw up in my mouth if he has full health.
[188:51.02]He just leaves.
[189:01.37]Oh, there he is!
[189:02.27]Found him!
[189:06.69]Thank God he needs one hit.
[189:07.87]What can I say?
[189:09.39]I don't have to throw up in my mouth now.
[189:16.46]Come on.
[189:17.46]What side are you on?
[189:25.84]Dark as all hell.
[189:26.67]Come on.
[189:31.34]Oh, he's behind us.
[189:32.42]This will be the last hit.
[189:38.22]This wind.
[189:39.32]This wind.
[189:40.43]This wind.
[189:40.97]This wind.
[189:41.47]This wind.
[189:43.73]One more.
[189:44.77]No, he's dead.
[189:45.61]He's dead.
[189:47.07]Give me your free shit.
[189:49.73]And let's shove on out.
[189:52.50]I'm going to get a behemoth horn and aid food.
[189:54.80]Okay.
[189:55.04]Okay.
[189:58.36]I'm giving this one more shot.
[190:00.28]I need to find the black Leviathan.
[190:05.19]If it's not the black Leviathan, then... I'm going to go to bed.
[190:09.09]And cry.
[190:25.04]Five more.
[190:29.68]The guy, the cheesy fiesta, the guy that sobbed earlier.
[190:32.56]Seriously, I want like cheesy Doritos now.

[191:03.67]Appreciate it.
[191:06.54]I'm going to go get a bowl of Progresso soup.
[191:10.42]I think I have that in my pantry.
[191:12.30]I'm not going to stop the stream just yet.
[191:20.23]But I am going to eat a bowl of Progresso soup.
[191:23.47]Why do I keep saying the brand?
[191:24.53]It's like it matters.

[192:14.06]To the family.
[192:17.66]We are a family.
[192:18.42]We're a big, huge family.
[192:22.30]So many of us.
[192:22.98]When we have our family reunion.
[192:24.17]Damn.
[192:24.91]Damn.
[192:26.67]That's going to be a catering bill that I don't want to bet the bill on, but that's going to be... No, and that... Redo.
[192:32.17]That's going to be a catering bill that I don't want to foot.
[192:35.17]There you go.
[192:36.41]Better.
[192:42.96]I do want to rob this ship, though.
[192:44.18]It's a little dumb boat.
[192:46.04]We'll get it.
[192:46.38]These things make a family reunion.
[192:51.00]Alright, what do they got?
[192:56.57]One ton in hold.
[192:57.32]They don't have anything.
[193:00.78]Useless ship.
[193:05.40]What are my thoughts on Crystal Pepsi coming back?
[193:09.17]I don't... I could care less.
[193:13.07]It's just Pepsi.
[193:15.77]It doesn't have brown food coloring in it.
[193:18.01]Okay.
[193:20.38]Okay.
[193:23.77]And you know Crystal Pepsi?
[193:25.01]Oh yeah, I love Crystal Pepsi.
[193:26.67]I love the fact that they just didn't put caramel color in the drink.
[193:41.40]Ugh, stop going into the wind!
[193:46.59]Almost there.
[193:51.33]Fuck this.
[193:55.12]sometimes you just gotta fucking go for it I wanted to smash into him but of course of course I can't because this wind is like this debilitating wind makes it like I'm on x4 speed you a bumper cars you
[194:25.32]Trying to run him off the road.
[194:30.59]Come on, pull over!
[194:31.91]It's like a police chase.
[194:34.93]How many more times do I have to do this?
[194:37.65]A lot.
[194:43.56]Hold on, my Twitch crashed.
[194:47.94]My dashboard crashed at least.
[194:53.91]Chrome crashing.
[194:55.83]What the heck?
[195:02.27]Okay.
[195:06.63]Big rigs over the ocean racing.
[195:14.82]Okay.
[195:15.80]Let's go.
[195:20.32]Save it.
[195:26.75]This job is true on your own ship.
[195:28.23]I think it would do damage to the other ship much more than mine.
[195:32.96]This is it, guys.
[195:41.14]I'm going to go make money or something.
[195:43.62]This is the last time I'm going to go look for a monster.
[195:51.89]Let's hope it's the other monster that's in the game.
[196:00.69]It's going to pull into one of the ports.
[196:02.73]Let's see what's going on.
[196:13.90]Time for now or not.
[196:14.88]Okay, here it comes.
[196:19.40]Place your bets.
[196:27.22]Oh, God.
[196:27.56]It's a new one.
[196:31.23]I just heard him say Leviathan.
[196:32.93]Whoa.
[196:33.15]Oh my god.
[196:37.16]That looks pretty- that looks big.
[196:38.24]That looks real big.
[196:40.28]That looks very, very big.
[196:45.88]What's this- what's this noise?
[196:47.69]This noise is so loud.
[196:49.69]Oh my god, I'm so sorry, guys.
[196:51.71]This is the loudest fucking thing I've ever heard.
[197:01.11]What's he doing?
[197:03.99]What's he doing?
[197:04.78]Holy shit!
[197:06.88]Oh my god!
[197:08.32]He's gonna eat the ship!
[197:26.42]Oh my god!
[197:29.00]Holy shit!
[197:31.46]Holy shit, that was fucking crazy!
[197:34.37]He just- How are you supposed to- Okay, hold on.
[197:37.55]I got it, I got it.
[197:40.15]Jesus.
[197:41.71]That was insane.
[197:44.96]Okay, hold on.
[197:45.88]Back up for a second.
[197:48.40]That was so cool.
[197:51.36]That was so fucking cool.
[197:54.18]Alright, if you're a dev on this game, fuck the whole rest of the game.
[198:02.33]Like, fucking forget about every other thing you were gonna put in the game.
[198:07.24]I don't care if you want to have, like, a trading simulator or a bunch of places.
[198:10.60]Delete fucking, like, 50% of all the ports that are in the game.
[198:15.76]All of them.
[198:17.18]And then, like, just set up, like, 20 different giant monsters.
[198:21.19]You know what I'm talking about?
[198:22.61]Get, like, Black Leviathan, get, like, octopuses, get, like, giant fish, get fucking, like, demons.
[198:29.07]Have a huge boss battle simulator, essentially.
[198:33.70]That would seriously be, like, the most fun.
[198:35.32]Oh, fuck.
[198:36.72]Okay, he's here.
[198:38.12]I did not expect him to be... I'm outside the zone.
[198:40.49]Okay, I almost just shit my pants there.
[198:49.49]Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[198:52.19]Like, forget about, like, the... This is cool shit, man.
[199:01.02]If there's only three of these monsters in the game, that is such a shame.
[199:04.22]Because this is by far the coolest part of the whole game.
[199:06.50]Not only coolest part of the whole game, but coolest feature that, like, has potential of any game I've played in the last, like, six to seven months at least.
[199:16.09]If you just made a Shadow of the Colossus on the sea with pirates, people would eat this up like crazy.
[199:23.75]There he is.
[199:29.73]So, okay, the strategy here is just don't go near.
[199:32.47]It's so loud.
[199:33.25]I'm sorry.
[199:33.61]Prepare your ears, guys.
[199:36.73]We gotta get, we gotta kill the Leviathan.
[199:40.97]Oh my lord.
[199:42.18]Turn it down.
[199:43.12]Turn the volume down.
[199:44.02]Is he still behind me?
[200:02.08]Holy shit.
[200:03.58]Holy shit.
[200:06.84]I don't know what to do.
[200:12.89]He's behind me again, okay?
[200:16.37]I think you have to... I think you have to shoot him.
[200:24.02]Turn the boat!
[200:31.15]Turn the boat!
[200:34.41]Turn the boat!
[200:36.83]Turn the fucking boat!
[200:38.05]Shoot him in the eye!
[200:39.26]Shoot him in his eye!
[200:41.36]Shoot him in the eye!
[200:42.24]That's how you do it!
[200:42.98]You got it.
[200:45.70]Fuck!
[200:52.62]How do you kill this thing?
[201:00.75]This is awesome.
[201:05.59]This is the best game ever.
[201:07.75]If it was the game that I wanted it to be.
[201:13.69]Imagine the potential of how fun this would be.
[201:15.36]Like sea battles with giant monsters.
[201:17.36]That's like the whole point of the game.
[201:26.20]My bad, I overshot that like crazy.
[201:29.48]No, fuck, no I don't.
[201:31.52]No I don't, no I don't.
[201:35.28]Where's he gonna be?
[201:39.50]Oh, no, no, no, I'm okay.
[201:47.78]Get a better boat?
[201:49.44]I'm kinda like out in nowhere right now.
[201:53.54]I so badly wanted to see the other monsters.
[201:59.56]Yeah, prepare the ears, guys.
[202:01.16]It's gonna be real loud here in a second.
[202:06.61]If this was VR, that'd be fucking crazy.
[202:09.59]Please turn this... There's nothing I can do about it.
[202:12.41]Like, the sound... It's just, like... It's already turned down.
[202:16.84]I'll do that.
[202:17.48]It's not gonna help at all.
[202:18.56]Trust me.
[202:20.04]It's just the way the game is, like, see?
[202:21.62]Doesn't even matter.
[202:22.08]You're just gonna have to turn the volume down.
[202:26.51]It's something about like the way the waves are like clipping against each other.
[202:36.23]Love to turn into air.
[202:37.01]Oh my god.
[202:38.19]Fuck the wind.
[202:45.15]Here we go.
[202:45.55]Let's fight him.
[202:46.13]Okay.
[202:53.89]Crazy.
[202:59.97]I almost feel like I... I don't know.
[203:02.17]I have no idea how you're supposed to fight him.
[203:07.19]I just gotta resue him.
[203:07.95]You just gotta hit him just a bunch of times.
[203:17.80]I did like 0% damage.
[203:18.62]There it comes!
[203:19.46]It turned your volume down!
[203:20.92]It turned down your volume!
[203:24.30]That's not even burning.
[203:47.33]You can't escape it.
[203:53.87]That did a lot of damage.
[203:58.33]That did so much damage, but he'll just bite you.
[204:06.14]He's just gonna bite you every time.
[204:07.44]You know what I'm saying?
[204:13.50]Maybe you just have to... Okay, I think I know what to do.
[204:24.91]He's already coming again.
[204:26.77]I really don't want to sail into the wind, but, like, that's his battle zone.
[204:37.80]I'm gonna try.
[204:39.96]Thank you, Chrono Warp.
[204:40.84]I don't know if you can hear me or not.
[204:45.26]Thank you, Chrono Warp.
[204:46.60]Welcome.
[204:47.68]Thank you.
[204:48.30]I'm gonna try to destroy him.
[204:49.28]I'll do what I can.
[204:49.88]Dude, I really wish the wind would change.
[204:52.20]This is so stupid.
[204:57.63]I have to skim around the outside.
[205:04.77]Ugh... Delete wind from the game.
[205:06.67]It serves no purpose.
[205:11.73]In fact, delete everything from this game except the monster fighting.
[205:14.97]Like I said before.
[205:15.61]Where is it?
[205:22.60]Where is it?
[205:24.22]Okay.
[205:24.40]I fucking have to go towards the wind!
[205:27.58]Oh, God!
[205:29.88]It's so loud!
[205:35.56]No!
[205:38.26]Get away from me!
[205:39.97]Fuck!
[205:44.75]I have to sail into the wind.
[205:49.95]We gotta talk about this.
[205:51.62]So, if I'm not in the blue circle, he de-aggro's.
[205:58.16]So, the wind right now is going this way.
[206:02.15]So I like can't even go in the circle and when I do, to get away from him, I have to go into the wind.
[206:08.01]Because if I turn this way and go away from the wind, I'm gonna de-aggro him.
[206:13.15]Because the stupidest fucking feature in this whole game.
[206:20.46]Fucking extreme wind challenge.
[206:23.84]I seriously have to, I'm gonna have to sail around the whole circle.
[206:28.56]I have to go around the entire fucking circle.
[206:33.11]Please, let me play the game.
[206:38.29]Jesus.
[206:38.81]Alright, let's go.
[206:41.81]Let's sail around the whole fucking circle.
[206:43.62]Okay, here we go.
[206:49.48]I just wanna fight a monster.
[206:57.96]I can't aggro the monster unless I'm inside the dumb blue circle.
[207:01.82]I'm not even going to say it again.
[207:04.42]Here he comes.
[207:04.84]I'm going into the circle now.
[207:09.37]No, he's not.
[207:09.73]He's going to leave me alone.
[207:10.35]God.
[207:42.90]Oh, I'm so, I'm so irritated.
[207:47.20]That I have to do this to avoid the zero mile per hour.
[207:54.00]In fact, I'm still gonna, I'm still gonna go into it.
[207:57.50]The wind is just following me around in a circle.
[208:01.46]Look at the wind.
[208:02.04]It's still, like, I still have to turn into the wind.
[208:04.29]What the fuck?
[208:06.94]Why?
[208:08.26]Why is this happening, man?
[208:09.94]What the fuck?
[208:14.26]Yeah, I know.
[208:14.76]I know the Leviathan's right there.
[208:18.08]But he doesn't come outside of the circle.
[208:19.94]He's a wuss.
[208:28.35]Uh... Yeah, the wind just keeps following me around.
[208:44.52]Okay, well, I think now if I... I'm saved right there.
[208:48.75]Just to the left.
[208:52.73]I just have to go this way.
[208:58.10]Let him go underwater.
[209:01.44]And I can drive away.
[209:02.46]Just gotta get in deep enough.
[209:08.59]Oh, no, I understand how wind works, I just think it's the dumbest thing in this whole game.
[209:13.35]I can understand wind, but damn, man, it makes you go, it stops you.
[209:18.48]If I turn into that red, I stop.
[209:21.16]Like a fucking stop sign.
[209:24.30]You don't slow down, you don't, no, you fucking stop.
[209:31.48]And it's dumb.
[209:33.40]And I will continue to say it's dumb.
[209:36.36]Here it comes.
[209:40.21]Alright, where is it?
[209:46.51]Where is it?
[209:49.57]Turn.
[209:51.19]This way.
[209:51.65]Alright, hit it.
[209:52.17]Go!
[209:52.39]Go!
[209:55.07]And there's a boat here now.
[209:58.65]You gotta be kidding me.
[210:01.09]Do not.
[210:01.79]And I have to turn into the wind to get back into the circle.
[210:06.02]You dumbass, get out of here.
[210:07.02]No, I'm gonna get caught.
[210:10.28]I'm dead.
[210:11.08]See ya.
[210:12.06]I don't think it's possible with this boat.
[210:23.55]I think I need a bigger boat.
[210:31.05]Because eventually at some point I have to turn into the wind.
[210:34.37]And I have to be so fast.
[210:36.29]This little fucking, like, dickhead pirate boat is not going to do it.
[210:41.52]I need to, like, upgrade so I don't stop in the wind.
[210:50.77]Let's see if I can go this way.
[210:54.01]Save after each hit.
[211:06.00]Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[211:10.75]I gotta get deeper into the circle if I have any chance.
[211:30.50]Stay in the circle, stay and see.
[211:31.72]I gotta... I'm out of the circle now and I can't turn.
[211:37.03]Turning gets me out of the circle.
[211:42.73]We're cheeseballing the fuck out of this.
[211:49.69]There he is, but I'm so screwed.
[211:51.85]Oh my god, I'm so dead here.
[211:53.77]Because I'm in the wind and I have to turn this way.
[212:16.41]I have to turn into the circle to get back in the circle.
[212:20.24]Fuck.
[212:20.72]I have to turn into the wind to get into the circle.
[212:23.92]Why is it in such a perfect place?
[212:25.26]Can the wind change?
[212:26.28]Change to go the other fucking way!
[212:32.32]I'm just hanging out on the outskirts.
[212:42.81]Do it.
[212:43.53]Go under.
[212:44.69]Go under.
[212:51.77]Oh, fuck.
[212:56.19]I can't do it.
[213:03.09]You have to be too quick.
[213:06.11]This is the default shit boat.
[213:07.78]I'm not going to be able to do it.
[213:11.84]I'll give it one more attempt.
[213:16.10]Just wait for a bigger fish.
[213:19.88]There he goes.
[213:39.38]I'm just gonna, I'm not even gonna move.
[213:50.02]You know what I'm saying?
[213:52.16]Just let him come to me.
[213:59.20]It's a bad position though.
[214:02.48]Don't want to turn.
[214:04.63]God damn it!
[214:10.25]I have to go into the wind so I can get in the circle!
[214:13.36]D'oh!
[214:13.58]What the fuck?
[214:16.40]The wind changed.
[214:17.74]The wind just changed.
[214:20.04]D'oh!
[214:21.18]God damn it!
[214:23.30]Damn it!
[214:24.83]Where's it gonna go?
[214:31.31]D'oh!
[214:31.47]Fuck!
[214:32.21]Son of a bitch!
[214:33.33]Fuck!
[214:34.33]Damn it!
[214:37.82]Ahh!
[214:40.94]This is starting to fucking piss me off.
[214:44.92]Why is it starting to trigger?
[215:10.27]This is so loud.
[215:11.60]Oh no.
[215:11.94]I gotta be going this way.
[215:46.33]Do you hear how loud this still is?
[215:52.02]This is still... Do you hear how fucking loud this game still is?
[215:56.58]I put it at like 2%.
[215:57.18]I can't even turn it off.
[216:17.32]Jesus Christ.
[216:27.28]Those sliders don't do anything, by the way.
[216:35.64]Where is he?
[216:35.92]Oh, God.
[216:44.11]Fuck you!
[216:45.63]It got louder.
[216:50.89]It actually got louder.
[217:02.14]It fucking got louder.
[217:16.60]What?
[217:22.02]Hold on.
[217:25.85]Turn, just mute the whole fucking game.
[217:39.52]Oh, look at that.
[217:40.58]Shut up game.
[217:44.38]Look at that.
[217:45.00]We can actually hear ourselves think.
[217:52.96]Save's coming.
[217:55.58]I'm so dead, he's gonna catch me.
[217:57.00]This is so much more anti-climactic with all the music.
[218:00.14]Oh no, ahhh.
[218:03.81]He got me.
[218:09.73]Let me turn it back up.
[218:12.37]I can't do this anymore.
[218:15.00]This is too, this is too much for my brain.
[218:19.08]It keeps putting me in the worst possible spot.
[218:24.01]Like, turn this way, turn.
[218:31.83]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[218:34.73]He's faster than me.
[218:35.79]No.
[218:36.42]Game over.
[218:39.20]Game over.
[218:40.12]He's, he's just faster than me.
[218:41.22]I'm not, I'm not gonna, I'm done.
[218:42.38]One more try.
[218:46.84]I'm just gonna rip the wheel to the left.
[218:48.22]We're gonna just go against the grain.
[218:55.85]I'm just gonna turn all the way around and... No, I'm fucked.
[219:00.09]I'm just gonna try to drive by him.
[219:02.27]No, he's got me.
[219:06.27]Kill him from the inside.
[219:08.96]I have to just stop moving and turn.
[219:12.96]Just turn, turn, turn, turn.
[219:13.90]Just don't do anything but turn.
[219:14.86]That's all I'm doing.
[219:15.50]I don't even care about shooting him.
[219:19.17]Turn.
[219:19.47]Don't even shoot.
[219:19.97]Who cares?
[219:20.33]Go.
[219:20.39]Alright.
[219:25.73]I have a chance.
[219:31.08]I have a slight chance.
[219:34.30]Save it.
[219:37.68]Sail into him.
[219:38.26]He's going to grab me out of midair and crunch me.
[219:44.96]Alright, if I get a successful hit... He didn't even come at me either.
[219:47.72]That sucks.
[219:48.72]He's gonna kill me.
[219:50.72]Yeah, I... Usually he goes under.
[219:52.72]He doesn't, like, actually... That was dumb.
[220:00.07]Alright, he's gonna do it.
[220:01.27]Okay.
[220:02.99]Sure thing.
[220:03.41]I feel like it's way too slow at x1 speed.
[220:15.36]No, we're done.
[220:16.42]I'm out.
[220:17.98]I'm rage quitting the game.
[220:21.64]I can't do it.
[220:22.54]It's not gonna happen.
[220:25.62]Alright, I will try just driving into his mouth.
[220:30.40]Like someone's suggesting.
[220:31.88]I'm just gonna go full speed right into his face.
[220:37.01]Come on, come up.
[220:37.93]I'm just gonna drive into him.
[220:46.45]Alright, come on up.
[220:47.46]Come on up!
[220:53.64]That was an instant death.
[220:58.08]Yeah, that's it.
[220:59.64]I'm not doing that again.
[221:01.87]Oh, update.
[221:02.43]Update link 0.3.
[221:04.19]Delete fucking wind from the game.
[221:05.71]How does that sound?
[221:15.05]It almost worked.
[221:20.53]Yeah, you know what I think?
[221:21.37]2 out of 10.
[221:22.41]I'm kidding.
[221:27.65]I'm kidding.
[221:28.03]3 out of 10.
[221:40.14]Let's see.
[221:44.62]No, it's fun.
[221:46.84]That's definitely a fun game.
[221:48.36]It just needs...
[221:53.29]I don't know.
[221:53.83]There's a couple of just stupid, irritating things I don't think that need to exist in a game like this.
[222:00.13]Because if the map is that... Okay, so you saw what I was doing.
[222:04.89]I was at x4 speed almost the whole game because of just how long it took to get from one place to the other.
[222:12.35]So if it already takes so long to sail around like that, that type of debilitating wind, that doesn't need to be in the game.
[222:22.45]Especially when I'm just, like, times four speeding to get from place to place.
[222:27.81]It just seems like it just randomly wants to just, oh, now the wind's this way, you gotta just turn a little.
[222:37.48]Besides that, I think it's fun.
[222:40.12]It's a really, really cool idea.
[222:43.20]Yeah, and you probably can upgrade your ship and stuff, but I'm sure you can get better wind-resistant stuff.
[222:50.82]But I felt like being in x4 speed was like how the game, like I wanted to, how fast I wanted it to go.
[223:00.38]Especially with a map that's that fucking enormous.
[223:04.20]But, um, it's early access right now, Manowar Corsair.
[223:07.50]I would say, as of right now, it's probably the only like pirate game that's worth playing.
[223:14.41]Considering the options that you have.
[223:16.81]There's not really very many options.
[223:23.47]I don't know.
[223:23.77]We'll see what they add.
[223:24.85]Like I said, if it becomes like a monster hunting simulator where you can fight like a bunch of fucking awesome monsters and stuff, then yeah.
[223:32.05]I would highly recommend it.
[223:38.51]There you go.
[223:39.03]There was a little taste of Manowar Corsair.
[223:43.19]It's currently in early access on Steam.
[223:46.25]Go look at it.
[223:46.85]Alright, no.
[223:49.62]Let me see.
[223:50.08]How long have I been streaming for?
[223:57.96]Only pirate that's real enough for Jerma.
[224:05.70]Monster hunter already exists?
[224:07.45]Yeah, monster hunter already exists, but it's not in a ship on the water.
[224:14.53]I feel like that type of combat system is fun for the big krakens and giant sea creatures and stuff, like loctus monsters and all that.
[224:26.64]being out on the open water, you feel much more at danger, I think.
[224:35.30]But I think that's going to be it.
[224:37.48]I've been going for about four hours now.
[224:42.91]I think I'm going to call it a night because I keep wanting to eat food.
[224:47.17]24-hour stream or bust?
[224:51.47]No.
[224:53.61]I will never be able to do a 24-hour stream.
[225:02.05]I'd get to like 12 hours and I would just have to stop.
[225:07.47]The longest stream I think I ever did was a Dark Souls stream and it was like 9 hours or something.
[225:16.00]Eat food?
[225:16.86]Turn it to a social eating stream?
[225:18.56]No.
[225:20.60]No, that's going to be it.
[225:21.20]I feel like there was some fun stuff in here though.
[225:26.25]Worth checking out.
[225:26.81]Maybe worth making a video on or something.
[225:29.09]We'll see.
[225:33.53]I will be live not tomorrow.
[225:38.21]Well, maybe.
[225:39.25]Depending on how long I'm going to a family cookout.
[225:46.62]We'll see.
[225:48.18]But maybe.
[225:50.42]Have a good night, guys.
[225:53.04]Is Star still streaming?
[225:54.52]I think Star is still streaming.
[225:56.04]If he is, he's probably playing Overwatch.
[225:59.88]Go say hi, maybe.
[226:03.01]And I'll catch you guys maybe tomorrow, if not the next day.
[226:05.55]Have a good night.
[226:06.93]I wish you luck.
[226:07.55]Thanks to all the viewers.
[226:08.45]Thanks to all the new subs, all the old subs, all you guys.
[226:10.43]Good night, everybody.
[226:11.11]I'm getting some tea.
[226:17.52]Good night.
