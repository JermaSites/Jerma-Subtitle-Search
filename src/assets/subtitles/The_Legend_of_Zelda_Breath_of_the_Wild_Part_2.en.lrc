[03:59.00]What do you mean?
[04:00.12]What?

[04:46.72]You know, I'm fighting until that 4-0 shows up.
[04:50.94]You know what I mean?
[04:52.36]On my 39th birthday.
[04:54.27]No, the night before my 40th birthday.
[04:58.07]I am going to be in a full Super Mario pajama onesie.
[05:03.79]And I'm going to eat popsicles and popcorn and watch fucking TV shows all day.
[05:09.74]And then I'm throwing all those pajamas away when I turn 40.
[05:15.58]I'm going to have an absolute pajama blowout on the night of my 40th birthday.
[05:21.84]And I'm just going to burn them all.
[05:24.23]And it's going to replace, my whole closet is going to replace with suits.
[05:26.53]Midlife crisis.

[06:24.55]Okay, so the jump is that.
[06:33.13]This is attack.
[06:34.83]It's you hold buttons.
[06:35.87]Alright, fine.
[06:43.06]Yeah, I'm still a young man.
[06:44.68]Yeah.
[06:46.58]Not until 40.
[06:46.94]Look, people are living longer anyways.
[06:59.18]You're using... Why do you still have a mop?
[07:01.38]Thanks for reminding me.
[07:02.46]Alright, so.
[07:03.00]What was the last thing we did?
[07:12.65]Check the map.
[07:13.29]Oh, that's a good idea.
[07:15.53]Alright.
[07:16.91]So, we're going here.
[07:18.81]This is locked memories.
[07:21.55]We have to go do... Impa told us that there was some crazy shit going on down here.
[07:28.02]How can we have a birthday hat on?
[07:29.24]It's because it's not my birthday.
[07:34.82]You can't read.
[07:36.85]I can read.
[07:38.39]Can we see more of your beautiful face?
[07:44.03]It's here.
[07:44.63]What do you want me to like pull my skin back?
[07:49.20]What do you mean?
[07:49.66]Let's see more.
[07:51.96]I'm in front of you right now.
[08:05.51]Your head is cropped.
[08:07.40]It's... Yeah, but... That's... What do you mean my... Yeah, my head is cropped because... That's how it works.
[08:14.03]That's what a face cam is, guys.
[08:17.33]You understand... The word face cam...
[08:23.01]It's not body, full body cam.
[08:25.09]It's not all of my upper body and like my face cam.
[08:29.80]It's a camera for your face to be in the corner.
[08:32.66]And that's precisely what I'm doing.
[08:34.94]That's how it's gonna stay.
[08:37.30]Let's go.
[08:37.56]Alright, so I need to go from here to here.
[08:40.98]I'm excited to play this game.
[08:42.16]I'm telling you, I'm actually excited about it.
[08:43.91]Is it fall damage?
[08:47.21]I would have died.
[08:47.89]Of course there is.
[08:48.41]Alright, let's glide.
[08:51.73]Put two headphones in for this.
[08:53.99]Welcome back to Breath of the Wild.
[08:55.47]We're going to explore this part of the map.
[09:07.22]We see your neck.
[09:13.14]That's an easy way to go across the whole game.
[09:19.79]This game is potentially hundreds of hours.
[09:21.65]I'm so excited.
[09:28.20]Made it with... with time to spare!
[09:30.50]Come on!
[09:32.56]The person's saying help?
[09:40.10]I'm coming.
[09:40.44]I want a reward.
[09:41.16]I'm coming.
[09:41.50]I want a reward.
[09:42.08]I'm coming.
[09:42.40]I want a reward.
[09:43.02]I'm coming.
[09:43.54]I can't say it.
[09:44.04]You know what I mean?
[09:44.56]I'm coming.
[09:44.90]I want a reward.
[09:50.60]I know that's kind of fucked up to say.
[09:51.84]Is this person dead?
[09:56.70]No, you're alright.
[09:57.90]I saved you.
[10:06.43]Wait, stop!
[10:11.79]They never fight fair.
[10:12.61]They always lurk and wait to ambush us.
[10:14.21]What a bunch of cowards.
[10:15.69]Seems like every time I go out hunting for hardy truffles, I'm taking my life in my hands.
[10:20.85]Time to stop floofing around here.
[10:23.63]Let's get back to the hunt for the hardy truffles.
[10:27.84]Why do we don't have a weapon?
[10:30.72]Something right behind me?
[10:37.12]What is she scared?
[10:37.66]Are you scared of this?
[10:40.50]Oh shit, he's attacking another citizen!
[10:46.58]You alright?
[10:47.00]Alright, let's keep going.
[11:04.03]Shrine somewhere.
[11:11.25]This way?
[11:11.55]Yeah.
[11:16.54]Yeah.
[11:17.16]What's this town?
[11:17.92]It's very bright.
[11:23.66]This is a bright town.
[11:24.84]Can I go in?
[11:30.15]Can I just go in any... Can I just go in... You can.
[11:34.11]You can go in buildings in this game.
[11:42.71]I gotta get it out of my system.
[11:53.00]Okay.
[11:58.02]Make their beds.
[11:59.56]Dude, you need to keep that shit in.
[12:02.01]Keep it in.
[12:04.69]No.
[12:05.09]Do you wanna know what keeping it in means for me?
[12:09.41]If I had to keep it all in, after like an hour, I'd be like this.
[12:13.49]It would be insane.
[12:18.56]I would explode.
[12:19.22]Oh, I can dye my clothing?
[12:36.00]No, I- should I put it- should I change the- wait, can I change the Nintendo Switch colors to like Xbox?
[12:44.09]This is worth 20 bucks for me.
[12:54.15]Okay, chain, choose a color.
[12:57.91]What?!
[12:59.17]You're wearing clothes that you can't dye!
[13:11.13]That's unfair.
[13:12.23]I wanted to make the shirt green.
[13:13.57]No, I need different clothes.
[13:17.02]I'm getting one hit by random enemies.
[13:21.98]I need armor and shit, right?
[13:23.34]I'm getting one hit killed by the random goofballs outside.
[13:28.39]Please be all red.
[13:39.97]No, it's not worth 20 bucks.
[13:43.14]Buy armor in this village.
[13:44.80]How much money do I even have?
[13:45.80]I only have $37.
[13:47.96]Why would I have no money?
[13:49.18]Checking everyone out today, too.
[13:54.75]The checking just never stops.
[13:55.95]Never stay to the Tonpu Inn.
[13:58.43]No.
[13:58.57]If you're not staying there, then I'm supposed to check out everyone who comes into town.
[14:03.53]That's weird.
[14:10.92]Dollars?
[14:11.40]It
[14:16.28]Sorry.
[14:18.94]Rupees.
[14:21.22]My 37 rupees.
[14:23.30]Sorry, I didn't say what it is.
[14:25.60]It's whatever bucks.
[14:27.72]Dollars.
[14:28.80]Money.
[14:29.51]How much money do I have?
[14:30.57]Do I have to say how many rupees do I have?
[14:32.99]You know what it is.
[14:37.27]You know what it is.
[14:38.05]That's like calling everything gold.
[14:41.77]That's fine.
[14:44.51]How many gold coins do I have?
[14:47.29]Grandpa, it's rupees, but you know what?
[14:50.19]You know what?
[14:50.49]Turn the game off.
[14:54.88]Any beauties or suspicious folks?
[14:58.46]What are you talking about?
[15:02.36]Go stay at the inn.
[15:03.28]You're not immersed?
[15:09.90]Yes, I am.
[15:14.73]I have so many side quests.
[15:16.01]I have to get... Alright.
[15:19.19]Getting overwhelmed with how many things there are to do.
[15:22.19]I've got to slow down.
[15:24.38]First things first.
[15:25.30]The most important thing that I want to do right now is go to the shrine.
[15:29.58]Because that's what I like.
[15:31.44]My favorite part.
[15:33.74]Where is it?
[15:37.27]This way.
[15:38.61]It might be underwater.
[15:45.44]There it is.
[15:47.62]Out of my fucking way.
[15:48.36]There it is.
[15:53.33]Oh, man.
[15:54.63]Oh, come on, dude.
[16:05.14]I was about to say something funny.
[16:06.84]I was going to say something funny.
[16:11.78]Yep.
[16:12.28]It was going to be wicked funny.
[16:19.83]If I fall off this and drown, I'm going to be very upset.
[16:24.05]No, I'm good.
[16:24.81]I glitched it out.
[16:27.09]Would I have a breakfast?
[16:28.25]Yogurt.
[16:32.10]I had a yogurt.
[16:32.66]It was good.
[16:39.26]Was it Greek yogurt?
[16:40.12]Yes.
[16:40.34]Shut the fuck up.
[16:46.03]Yeah, it was.
[16:48.77]Shut the fuck up.
[16:56.74]What's wrong?
[16:57.58]Wait.
[16:59.12]Oh, I thought I was gonna just walk in.
[17:04.48]It's not goat milk.
[17:07.20]Greek yogurt is not goat milk.
[17:09.30]Shut the fuck up.
[17:20.64]It can be.
[17:21.78]No, it's not!
[17:22.98]Greek yogurt is not made from goat cheese!
[17:25.88]Shut the fuck up!
[17:31.51]To you who sets foot, welcome to my shrine.
[17:46.09]Why are you so rude?
[17:49.22]I'm not... I'm just kidding.
[17:50.54]God.
[17:51.18]God.
[17:51.54]Alright, where's Ball?
[17:57.88]Greek yogurt is not goat milk.
[18:02.15]Why did I think I could reach that?
[18:03.45]It's your fault for distracting me with your goat cheese.
[18:06.69]Okay.
[18:14.09]I need to eat something before I die in here.
[18:22.36]What's that?
[18:26.71]Oh, emote only is on.
[18:27.69]Right, so I don't get spoiled.
[18:33.45]Okay, I've got... What about magnet?
[18:35.63]Can I do anything?
[18:36.93]Move anything?
[18:37.41]Pull anything?
[18:38.75]Twist anything?
[18:41.01]Doesn't look like it.
[18:42.05]So, what about stasis?
[18:44.30]Okay.
[18:49.02]Okay.
[18:52.57]Where's the ball?
[19:02.36]I think it's over here.
[19:06.87]Oh OK well.
[19:09.37]Move.
[19:11.27]No, you're not going to gyroscope me right now, right?
[19:25.25]Will he beat the dungeon before 1 p.m.?
[19:27.37]Yeah, of course I will.
[19:29.43]Get it right.
[19:30.45]Check it out.
[19:46.14]I'm telling you right now, you should be voting for me to win.
[19:50.82]Yeah, almost.
[19:51.97]Oh, shoot.
[19:57.10]Wait a minute, can I?
[19:57.70]I could probably just launch it over there.
[20:13.28]What time is it?
[20:13.68]Alright, no, I'm gonna do it the right way.
[20:29.09]Oh, you piece of shit.
[20:47.30]Yeah, there you go.
[20:48.46]Before 1pm.
[20:48.84]Done.
[20:59.42]What's going on?
[21:24.66]Oh, wait.
[21:25.42]I can make this jump now if I tilt it down.
[21:33.17]Oh, that's just a chest.
[21:34.71]That's just a treasure chest.
[21:36.15]I thought that was a button.
[21:37.29]I thought that was the end of the maze.
[21:40.28]Oh, my goodness.
[21:41.34]Right.
[21:41.58]I have to get it down here.
[21:42.72]Okay.
[21:44.14]I thought that was a button.
[21:45.02]I thought I was going to drop a separate ball.
[21:46.74]I don't know.
[21:48.28]What time is it?
[21:49.38]I still don't think you should vote against me.
[21:54.22]I still don't think you should have voted against me.
[21:59.54]Because I figured that part out.
[22:01.11]That's the most important thing to figure out.
[22:06.75]So watch this.
[22:43.02]yeah I saw I I saw the person I I yeah I saw it yeah you don't think I've read what people say sometimes about me
[22:50.45]Somebody told me, well, maybe indirectly, I don't know, I heard that watching me play this was like watching an early human learn how to use tools for the first time.
[22:59.70]It's kind of rude, I think.
[23:06.06]Fuck.
[23:07.39]Alright.
[23:10.29]Alright.
[23:12.07]Alright.
[23:15.21]Oh yeah, how's that for a fucking tool, huh?
[23:23.18]Take that early human.
[23:24.78]Fuck you.
[23:25.52]God damn it.
[23:26.12]Alright.
[23:31.00]I got seven minutes.
[23:31.78]I'm fine.
[23:32.06]What the fuck?
[23:55.71]Oh my goodness.
[24:03.96]Alright, I gotta get it.
[24:08.69]Just do it right.
[24:09.43]What time is it?
[24:10.59]I got plenty of time.
[24:29.38]Believers, you win.
[24:55.46]This doesn't count as... You know what I mean?
[24:58.74]This doesn't count.
[24:59.22]I already beat it.
[25:09.11]I actually... I thought this was a button.
[25:16.23]Frenic bow.

[27:29.35]Okay, so... Cool.
[27:32.83]Besides that regular mission... Should I go into the pond?

[27:41.96]Yeah.
[27:43.10]Alright, I'm gonna go check out the filthy pond.
[27:48.68]Did I just take something off?
[27:50.72]Wait.
[27:51.42]What did I just take off?
[27:52.16]Yeah, alright.
[27:52.72]I want to just be able to know where that is.
[28:02.49]Turn around.
[28:04.89]Why was I on the map?
[28:05.97]That's because it's not a stamp.
[28:08.23]Oh my god, I need the buttons.
[28:09.91]Oh my god, I just wish A and B were flipped.
[28:27.47]What about this person?
[28:32.61]Got any stuff?
[28:46.64]No stuff in here?
[28:48.12]There's no stuff.
[28:49.18]You can't steal anything?
[28:52.58]So what's the point of having houses you can walk into?
[28:57.08]I'm just in a gameplay... in just purely a gameplay setting.
[29:01.07]What's the point of having houses?
[29:03.35]If you can't steal, uh, like, jewels from their chest.
[29:11.99]You can't sleep in the bed.
[29:13.45]You can't steal plates off the counter.
[29:15.09]What the heck?
[29:20.33]Ooh!
[29:21.15]It's probably one of those, um... No.
[29:25.98]Heads up!
[29:33.22]Okay, what's down here?
[29:33.94]Anything cool in the pond?
[29:41.07]Oh.
[29:45.69]Anything cool in the pond?
[29:47.03]No?
[29:47.79]There's got to be something cool near the pond, right?
[29:49.43]Should I just get some fish?
[29:51.56]Alright, cool.
[30:04.57]Anything of interest here?
[30:07.59]It was just a rusty sword.
[30:08.91]Whoa, wait.
[30:09.93]Something interesting.
[30:10.49]What is this?
[30:12.61]Ray?
[30:12.92]You don't say.
[30:22.82]You can hear my voice.
[30:23.80]Yes.
[30:25.70]Now that is a surprise.
[30:27.24]What were you praying for?
[30:28.64]Long life?
[30:29.28]Wealth?
[30:29.96]Like so many of your kind?
[30:32.14]Whichever it was, you came to the right place.
[30:34.68]A dealer in life and power.
[30:36.10]That was me once.
[30:37.90]Alas, my life for money bargains didn't sit well with the goddess Hylia.
[30:42.09]She trapped me in this stone statue long, long ago.
[30:50.13]Villagers, here, call me the horn statue and don't even bother to wipe away the bird droppings.
[30:56.17]One would think years upon years of such treatment would have made me mend my ways.
[31:04.18]Does an audio desync?
[31:06.52]I'll fix it.
[31:08.92]I've only been biding my time for the moment someone who can hear me appears.
[31:12.87]Someone such as you.
[31:14.57]But I've said enough.
[31:15.77]Now then, shall we strike a bargain?
[31:18.44]Then stay that way.
[31:19.50]No further action on your part is required.
[31:25.73]Wait, that was mine.
[31:27.21]What, um, excuse me, what just happened?
[31:30.23]Um, do I get that back?
[31:33.48]That's not good.
[31:36.28]My touch is as subtle as ever.
[31:38.64]Note how I took that essence from you without leaving a mark.
[31:44.46]What?
[31:44.96]That's not fair.
[31:46.50]So wait, this thing just eats hearts?
[31:48.48]How do I get that back?
[31:51.75]Alright, hold on.
[31:52.13]This isn't audio desynced.
[31:53.27]Let me fix it.
[31:53.85]So you're saying when I go 1, 2, 3.
[31:55.85]1, 2, 3.
[31:57.65]There is a delay.
[32:05.12]There is?
[32:05.40]Okay, is it on me to the gameplay or is the game audio?
[32:12.98]It's desynced.
[32:19.67]It's not my voice.
[32:20.39]Okay.
[32:22.48]The game audio itself is doing it.
[32:24.86]Hmm.
[32:25.04]Let me see.
[32:27.28]The game audio has desynced from the game video.
[32:29.06]That's interesting.
[32:29.62]That's weird.
[32:31.02]Uh, let me see if I can fix it.
[32:33.04]So, okay.
[32:34.35]Are you... Is it happening late?
[32:39.39]Like, do you hear the sound first and then I move it?
[32:42.47]Or do you hear the sound late?
[32:52.11]There's one guy.
[32:52.69]The game visual is happening late.
[32:59.09]Hold on.
[32:59.55]If I can fix it, I will.
[33:04.81]Ready?
[33:05.17]Check this out.
[33:06.79]Just check this out.
[33:07.29]Hold on.
[33:14.32]How's this?
[33:21.91]Better?
[33:27.69]Perfect?
[33:33.13]Okay.
[33:34.69]Cool.
[33:39.91]So, what... The horn statue took one of your containers.
[33:46.67]Well, what the fuck?
[33:52.29]Uh, give it back.
[33:52.99]Oh, it's just if you want to... Okay.
[34:22.53]So if you want to put more points into stamina, you can.
[34:27.31]It's a respec.
[34:28.51]Alright.
[34:29.73]Well, I don't want to do that.
[34:37.70]In fact, I probably should do heart again next level up.
[34:45.53]Okay.
[34:46.09]Money and life are all as one to me.
[34:48.13]If you're ready to begin, then first you must sell me either type of essence for 100 rupees.
[34:53.62]And then when you want to buy an essence back, it's 120 rupees.
[34:59.92]Okay.
[35:01.94]Well, I'm not going to fuck up my build, so we're never going to talk ever again.
[35:07.28]Good day.
[35:08.52]Nice to meet you.
[35:09.38]We will never speak again.
[35:12.65]Fucking idiot.
[35:13.53]Fucking moron.
[35:16.38]alright that's cool that was that's what was over here so I'm gonna mark this let me mark it as um I don't know point of what's like a good point of interest
[35:44.11]This should be, I don't know, this is gonna, but this means boss, right?
[35:48.47]Skull to me is bad boss, not NPC.
[35:54.66]Maybe this.
[35:55.34]Like, oh, it's a leaf.
[35:58.52]Star, maybe?
[35:59.12]Yeah, star's probably a good idea.
[36:00.20]Yeah, that's a good one.
[36:05.71]Okay, cool.
[36:08.19]Um, got that.
[36:14.35]What else is there to look at?
[36:18.11]I think I can just go do the quest, right?
[36:22.55]Are they quests in this game or are they missions?
[36:24.45]Are they, is it quest?
[36:27.45]Go get a quest?
[36:30.18]Or is it a objective?
[36:31.98]Mission, what's it called?
[36:32.74]Alright, I'm gonna sell some, maybe I can get some new armor.
[36:41.68]Ooh, look at this.
[36:44.31]250?
[36:44.33]Yeah, I want, I want the armor, armor.
[36:50.39]Yeah, how much is this total?
[36:51.69]180.
[36:53.26]250, that's 350.
[36:53.84]Like, 400.
[36:56.54]Five, I, like, I was gonna drop $700 on the table and just walk away with this.
[37:02.64]I'm just gonna go, I don't, I'm not doing math.
[37:04.10]Just, just keep it.
[37:05.16]And leave.
[37:06.56]Well, I wouldn't have to do the math, they would.
[37:10.48]Nevermind, whoops.
[37:11.58]Alright, so, who do I sell to?
[37:19.73]Why do you look like John from Garfield?
[37:21.15]I don't know.
[37:26.98]What can I actually sell?
[37:28.02]I don't really have much to sell.
[37:42.53]Do you like food?
[37:44.87]Whoa, look at this is worth a lot.
[37:47.58]All my gourmet dishes will get a lot of money.
[37:50.18]I'm just gonna sell everything.
[38:03.15]Oh, and I can...
[38:20.49]Nobody knows what that is.
[38:22.35]Maybe one person doesn't.
[38:23.41]That's all I care about.
[38:24.23]That's literally all I care about.
[38:25.39]Alright, what about the Amber?
[38:31.54]I'm gonna sell some of these fish too.
[38:33.08]Who cares?
[38:36.74]Sell all.
[38:38.04]You're gonna find tons of it anyways.
[38:39.71]Tons of Amber?
[38:40.35]Are you sure?
[38:44.53]Sell all the gems.
[38:45.25]You're never gonna use them.
[38:50.07]Really?
[38:50.35]I feel like that was a mistake.
[38:58.10]Okay.
[39:00.30]Sell it all.
[39:00.86]No, I'm not selling it all.
[39:05.78]I want this armor.
[39:09.18]There it is.
[39:11.10]Got it.
[39:13.07]I want the whole set.
[39:21.33]200.
[39:21.35]Thank you.
[39:24.13]Please, I'm begging you, sort your items.
[39:28.53]They're exactly where I want them.
[39:30.71]Wait.
[39:30.91]I don't think I want this.
[39:34.39]Because this helmet is good, right?
[39:38.07]This is a climbing helmet?
[39:40.28]Yeah, I'm keeping this.
[39:41.70]Can I have the Nintendo Switch shirt underneath it?
[39:53.95]No.
[39:59.22]You look like a dork.
[40:00.86]No, I don't.
[40:01.30]Alright, I finally have armor.
[40:06.88]Does this weigh... Does it weight in the game?
[40:08.78]Do I have to worry about... Oh, you're going to be fat rolling or something.
[40:14.85]Die the armor now.
[40:18.05]Oh, cool.
[40:18.73]That'd be cool.
[40:21.01]There's no weight.
[40:21.57]Okay.
[40:27.16]Where's the person that was dying stuff?
[40:32.90]There you are, alright.
[40:38.84]Right in front of me, to the right.
[40:43.84]Aw, dude!
[40:44.42]Aw, sick goat milk!
[40:45.60]Fucking shit, no!
[40:56.34]Alright, so what can I do?
[40:57.08]Uh, let's die.
[41:01.07]Would you like to get back to square one?
[41:03.09]What do you mean square one?
[41:18.24]Shouldn't I be Link?
[41:25.12]I can pretend I have the Switch shirt on underneath.
[41:43.53]Didn't they make a Legend of Zelda game where there were four links?
[41:47.83]And they were each... They had different... Like, one was pink, one was green, one was blue.
[41:51.86]And it was kind of like...
[41:54.70]Was that movie with all the emotions?
[41:59.17]With the mad one?
[42:01.59]What was it called?
[42:02.53]Inside, right?
[42:03.19]The Four Swords, okay.
[42:06.61]So, who was, like, the funny, goofy, like, goofy one?
[42:15.14]Right?
[42:15.40]Because I want... One of them was, like, sleepy.
[42:18.12]One of them was, like, grumpy.
[42:19.68]Which one of the links was the funny, goofy one?
[42:24.30]Is this not happening in the Four Swords?
[42:28.12]Wasn't it like, oh, one was like a sleepy one.
[42:30.56]One was grumpy.
[42:32.52]One was... I'm thinking of the Seven Dwarves.
[42:36.35]But they did that, didn't they?
[42:37.85]That's not a thing in Four Swords.
[42:45.69]They didn't do like a Red is Angry.
[42:48.29]Blue is tired.
[42:51.25]Yellow is crazy or kooky.
[42:54.65]They didn't do that?
[42:57.23]That's Hyrule Warriors.
[43:03.72]Dude, you're thinking of parody animations.
[43:12.18]What?
[43:20.19]Alright, well, I'm gonna be light blue.
[43:26.31]Wait, five ingredients?
[43:29.85]This is... Have you ever done a sober stream?
[43:42.50]I was thinking about it.
[43:43.60]Should I do... Is it worth... Are these things worth it?
[43:48.48]I feel like I need these.
[43:49.70]I don't care, whatever.
[43:53.06]I'm thinking... Zelda the Four Swords Adventures on the GameCube.
[44:01.52]No, somebody said it's real.
[44:05.51]No, wait, we're talking in the mod chat.
[44:07.45]The mod chat's saying you guys are on crack.
[44:11.87]Crack!
[44:17.71]It's real.
[44:18.39]It's in the Four Swords.
[44:23.16]The game is real, but I don't think they had personalities like that, did they?
[44:35.06]They were depicted as acting differently.
[44:37.17]Yeah!
[44:37.91]One of them was sleepy, one of them was hungry, one of them was dashing, and one of them was vixen, and whatever it was.
[44:55.58]The manga had flat out different personalities.
[45:01.06]Red was shy.
[45:02.06]Purple was a cool guy.
[45:03.30]I told you I knew it!
[45:11.23]Why are you talking about the reindeer?
[45:20.53]I knew I had this right.
[45:27.88]What happened to the quest that was here?
[45:31.16]Oh, I switched it.
[45:31.98]Okay.
[45:32.10]Alright.
[45:37.60]Let's see.
[45:38.52]I want to do Treasure Twilight Relic.
[45:43.87]That seems kind of fun.
[45:47.11]Strange Mask.
[45:49.69]What does EX mean?
[45:51.03]Ancient Horse?
[45:52.85]Oh, this is DLC.
[45:54.37]Oh.
[45:56.54]Are all the side quests DLC?
[46:08.29]Destroy Ganon.
[46:09.77]Free the Divine Beast.
[46:10.95]There are four.
[46:11.53]The Divine Beast... Okay.
[46:14.93]Yeah, this one here.
[46:19.50]I look cool now.
[46:26.42]The game came out in 2004.
[46:31.11]I knew I wasn't crazy.
[46:42.03]Where's your horse?
[46:42.69]I don't use the horse in this game.
[46:46.41]It's too hard to control.
[47:06.14]You need a better horse.
[47:09.07]I'll find one.
[47:09.65]I need to level up.
[47:13.57]How far away is this?
[47:14.39]This is not that far.
[47:21.08]There's a purple cow?
[47:23.05]Wait.
[47:24.41]They'll all pay.
[47:26.71]What do you want?
[47:27.97]Don't act so clueless.
[47:29.91]Although, fine.
[47:30.69]You seem harmless enough.
[47:31.57]Forgive me.
[47:32.39]I've just been on edge with all these monsters running around.
[47:35.15]They come up from Hateno Beach to steal my sheep.
[47:38.14]If someone doesn't do something, I won't have any left.
[47:42.46]Let's go do that right now.
[47:43.42]It's right here.
[47:45.84]That's far away.
[47:46.66]No, too far.
[47:50.06]That's too far.
[47:52.22]That's way too far.
[47:58.36]That's way too far away.
[48:00.56]No, no, I'm not doing that.
[48:13.71]It's not too far if you had a horse.
[48:16.27]I'll get to the horse later.
[48:27.83]That's a two-second walk.
[48:35.03]Can I actually make this without... I think I can, yeah.
[48:40.17]The map is not that big.
[48:45.73]It seems like it's pretty big.
[48:46.79]I think I'm just going to make it
[48:59.59]There we go.
[49:00.41]Okay, you are all the way out here.
[49:14.76]You are all the way out here.
[49:15.98]What do these Minecraft signs say?
[49:22.18]Ancient Tech Lab.
[49:23.67]Enter at your own risk.
[49:29.40]It's bigger than Skyrim?
[49:32.18]I don't really know the scale of Skyrim because I didn't really play it.
[49:34.74]Alright, here we go.
[49:39.89]If the flame is blue, the furnace is hot.
[49:41.85]Don't touch it.
[49:53.67]Good morning.
[49:55.54]This is Hatena Ancient Tech Lab.
[49:57.26]Do you have some business with the director?
[49:58.79]Yes, I do.
[50:00.63]The director's in the back.
[50:02.17]Terribly busy person, that one.
[50:03.35]Please try to keep it brief.
[50:10.47]Good morning!
[50:11.58]I imagine you've never seen so many books in one place.
[50:13.84]Pretty incredible, isn't it?
[50:14.66]I mean, it's actually not that many.
[50:20.68]We've gathered all of Hyrule's known literature on ancient civilizations here.
[50:26.27]As for the actual number of books, well, uh... Is that the thing on your waist?
[50:30.68]Is that a Sheikah?
[50:32.76]If I'm not mistaken, that's a real Sheikah slate, isn't it?
[50:35.34]Never actually seen one in person.
[50:37.76]If you could just show me the runes on it, I'd be most appreciative.
[50:43.17]Stasis.
[50:44.17]Magnesis.
[50:45.73]The Remote Bomb and Cryonis.
[50:48.59]What else?
[50:48.91]Let's see.
[50:50.53]Oh, that's it.
[50:51.38]But, hmm.
[50:52.32]Strange.
[50:53.46]Doesn't seem like you have the basic runes.
[50:57.57]Why are they not there?
[50:58.35]Oh, where are my manners?
[50:59.97]I nearly forgot to introduce myself.
[51:01.99]My name is Simon.
[51:04.32]You are Link, right?
[51:07.12]You know my name.
[51:09.52]Lady Impa caught me up to speed.
[51:12.02]You see, we were told a young man holding a Sheikah Slate will appear and you must do all you can to help.
[51:17.46]You'll be the hope that awakens from the slumber of restoration.
[51:20.04]His name will be Link.
[51:21.30]What's your name?
[51:24.77]It's not my name.
[51:26.65]My name is Fred.
[51:32.69]Director, listen!
[51:33.45]Ms.
[51:33.65]Director, this is the REAL Sheikah Slate!
[51:38.68]That's right, I have an industry star director.
[51:40.04]Ms.
[51:42.36]Pura happens to be right over there.
[51:43.70]Uh... Ms.
[51:48.44]Pura is the world's foremost Thario in ancient Hyrule culture.
[51:54.71]Wait, there was... Okay.
[51:57.27]Check it.
[51:57.61]Don't spill the beans.
[52:21.03]Do you guys have any money?
[52:23.07]I just want- I'm just looking for money.
[52:24.87]Can I, like, re-shuffle the books or whatever?
[52:27.44]Like, I just want some money.
[52:31.06]Director of the laboratory, it's not Simon!
[52:33.66]It's me!
[52:36.00]Snappity-snap.
[52:38.30]Anyway, Linky.
[52:39.80]Do you remember any dreams from your time in the slumber of restoration?
[52:45.17]You don't look like you've changed a bit in the last hundred years, but something must have happened in that time.
[52:52.89]Well, no matter.
[52:53.35]I'm just happy you're still in one piece.
[52:55.77]Linky.
[52:57.97]What's with that look?
[52:58.65]You still remember me, right?
[53:00.87]I don't remember.
[53:01.55]Really?
[53:02.93]Well, I'm so shocked.
[53:03.62]I don't know if I'll ever be able to recover from this.
[53:06.02]Even though a hundred years ago, I took you to the Shrine of Resurrection after Calamity Ganon fatally wounded you.
[53:11.84]Even though I was the one who put you safely into the Slumber of Restoration.
[53:15.48]Despite all that, you still don't remember me.
[53:18.15]Oh, sorry!
[53:18.33]I have a bad habit of taking notes rather abruptly like that.
[53:21.59]It's a charming quirk isn't it?
[53:22.37]Anywho, do you have any questions for me?
[53:38.17]Or perhaps it's not rude at all.
[53:39.41]I suppose it's actually a rather logical conclusion to jump to.
[53:41.68]The truth is, I looked this way because of a failed experiment.
[53:45.44]Well, I say failed, but in some ways it was a success.
[53:47.88]I documented the full affair in my diary upstairs.
[53:51.44]But the whole thing is embarrassing, so I insist don't read it.
[53:53.74]I'm not gonna go read it.
[53:56.90]I don't care.
[53:57.54]I asked if there was any money in this house.
[54:02.73]Do you have any money?
[54:04.85]Anyway, enough about that.
[54:05.71]Back to the topic at hand.
[54:07.63]After a hundred years, here you are, here to defeat Calamity Ganon, who is growing in strength with every passing moment.
[54:18.48]And to rescue our beloved princess, Zelda, that is, if you've got the courage to try.
[54:22.58]And to help the one true hero, I, the one and only Pura, will restore the basic functions missing from the Sheikah Slate.
[54:29.04]So, cool.
[54:31.75]Do it.
[54:33.71]I knew you were going to say that.
[54:34.81]Alright, then first need you to run an errand for me.
[54:38.32]What's that look on your face?
[54:39.14]Well, I'm fine.
[54:39.70]That's actually what I came here to do.
[54:43.12]I did not.
[54:45.11]You're pretty considerate.
[54:46.69]But then I suppose that's because you're actually over 100 years old.
[54:50.65]Let me explain what this errand entails.
[54:53.14]You know, the unlit furnace on the wall just outside this laboratory.
[54:58.14]Could you please bring the blue flame from the ancient furnace in town?
[55:03.74]Oh, and also use it to light our furnace.
[55:05.14]I thought it said don't touch it.
[55:11.74]This sweet little guidance stone will start working once you do that, allowing us to restore your missing runes.
[55:17.54]Okay.
[55:20.94]Okay, then I'm counting on you for that.
[55:22.02]Alright, let's go get it.
[55:25.86]I'm going right now.
[55:27.05]I'm gonna go as fast as I fucking possibly can.
[55:31.61]Okay.
[55:31.89]If it ain't back in 30 minutes, it's free.
[55:49.85]You can get a motorcycle?
[56:14.10]I was finding the urge so much to just go like... to do a really loud annoying sheep sound.
[56:22.29]It was eating me inside.
[56:26.41]You know, I've done that once before.
[56:27.89]I don't know... I hope I'm not like... putting in fake memories.
[56:33.84]But didn't I do that on stream once?
[56:37.39]And people flipped out.
[56:38.93]People were pissed.
[56:40.66]People were like, don't fucking do that again.
[56:42.26]Like, that was not funny.
[56:43.18]It actually was annoying.
[56:43.94]I swear to God that happened.
[56:45.90]How do I pick it up?
[57:07.24]Alright, I got it.
[57:07.72]Does this count?
[57:11.31]I think it has to be a torch.
[57:17.53]I don't think I even have a torch.
[57:22.26]Oh, I do.
[57:22.70]Okay.
[57:30.84]Wait, this thing?
[57:35.33]Oh, this is going to be annoying.
[57:41.67]It better be worth it.
[57:42.57]Just run.
[57:49.77]I can't sprint.
[57:50.65]It blows out if I sprint.
[57:54.43]God damn it.
[57:55.20]Hold it up, man.
[57:56.10]I could have done that.
[57:57.68]I could have held that up.
[57:59.96]It's two feet of water, man.
[58:10.34]I have a better idea.
[58:18.91]Yeah.
[58:19.31]Thank you.
[58:23.81]Thank you.
[58:27.34]What's the next one?
[58:28.64]Is there one up there?
[58:31.74]Is that one?
[58:32.24]Is that one all the way up there?
[58:39.71]Who's the next one?
[58:49.86]Just go find it, alright.
[58:57.46]How long does this last?
[59:02.11]Oh, I see one right there.
[59:23.54]What?
[59:24.87]What's going on?
[59:26.33]What the fuck is happening?
[59:29.07]What is happening?
[59:29.83]Why is this fire?
[59:30.41]Why am I on fire?
[59:31.11]What?
[59:31.21]Okay, I need to walk with it.
[59:57.50]Alright.
[60:24.36]The arc on the... I'm just walking.
[60:25.72]I don't... Put the bow away.
[60:28.04]I'm just walking.
[60:29.30]Just walk with the torch.
[60:30.10]But I... Is this gonna blow out?
[60:33.10]Does this blow out if I run all the way up there?
[60:36.03]It's gonna be annoying.
[60:36.71]Everyone's gonna laugh at me, but I'm going.
[60:47.51]I'm losing my mind.
[60:48.43]If I... If anybody laughs at me for this, I'm gonna ban you from my community, okay?
[60:55.87]You're gonna get banned from my community if you don't.
[60:57.39]I don't know.
[61:03.24]Look, I redid it.
[61:05.68]What a strangely colored fire.
[61:06.94]It's almost like an anglerfish's lore.
[61:21.91]Okay.
[61:25.93]Alright, I'm back.
[61:29.75]No, I'm not.
[61:30.25]Wait, where the hell am I going?
[61:37.66]Wait.
[61:40.78]I gotta go so far?
[61:43.92]Oh my god, I have to go all the fucking way up.
[61:45.79]What do you mean wrong way?
[61:51.19]Oh my god, this is gonna be annoying.
[61:56.29]There's no weird glitch that I can go like, like, SKETCH IT!
[61:59.27]SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKETCH SKET
[62:31.66]I actually might not make this.
[62:43.89]Don't go out.
[62:44.39]Don't go out.
[62:44.83]Don't go out.
[62:49.54]Don't blow out.
[62:50.32]Don't do it.
[62:51.52]Yes.
[62:52.16]Alright, we're good.
[63:05.99]Okay, now you want me to light right here?
[63:08.03]I did it!
[63:15.56]Travel gate.
[63:16.30]Ooh, cool.
[63:18.56]Alright.
[63:20.22]So now you're going to give me my runes?
[63:23.60]How do you feel about fried spam?
[63:25.30]I've never had it.
[63:25.86]I don't think I've ever eaten it.
[63:28.64]Okay, take a look over there.
[63:29.30]There we go.
[63:31.14]Cool, cool.
[63:37.08]So what does this do?
[63:39.20]Basic runes?
[63:50.05]What did I say?
[63:50.41]I said nah?
[63:51.69]To what?
[63:55.59]Oh.
[63:58.33]I thought it was... Okay.
[64:02.06]Give me... I didn't... I just wanted to say nah.
[64:04.40]I wanted us to do it.
[64:12.91]I just turned around.
[64:13.67]I was just going to put the thing in there.
[64:18.09]She hates you.
[64:26.23]Alright.
[64:27.27]What do I get?
[64:29.49]Camera.
[64:32.15]Will you just unlock the camera app?
[64:39.50]New iOS update.
[64:51.00]Oh, the ancient runes.
[65:00.17]The ancient runes.
[65:02.07]Magnetism.
[65:03.95]Cryostasis.
[65:07.34]Stasis.
[65:09.64]Camera app.
[65:12.45]The ancient route.
[65:20.12]Uh.
[65:23.02]What do I do with all this?
[65:26.40]Creatures.
[65:26.92]An iPhone 3 camera.
[65:42.37]Okay.
[65:45.15]Camera.
[65:46.45]We definitely have to take a picture, right?
[65:48.59]Can you do a selfie?
[65:51.76]Okay.
[65:59.52]No, no, no.
[66:03.10]Delete that.
[66:05.47]Oh, my God.
[66:11.31]I hate this.
[66:27.96]Alright, this is funny.
[66:28.78]Okay, picture.
[66:36.32]Save an album, sure.
[66:37.20]Alright, that's gonna actually be fun.
[66:46.53]That's the most expressive Link has ever been in a game.
[66:48.91]Okay, let me see.
[67:00.49]Hmm?
[67:01.45]Who's this beautiful young creature?
[67:03.03]I'm deleting that immediately.
[67:10.68]I guess that's my cue.
[67:12.12]Sorry, I kind of lost it there.
[67:13.06]I wasn't on purpose.
[67:15.71]Hmm, and it's not just a pretty girl in these images.
[67:17.95]These are also some old landscape photos.
[67:20.03]Wait, somebody else's camera?
[67:26.06]I knew Princess Zelda had made frequent use of the camera feature.
[67:29.18]Wait, I have somebody else's photos?
[67:37.48]Wait, what?
[67:38.14]It's a hand-me-down phone?
[67:45.30]They're your old photos.
[67:50.94]Okay, check in with Impa.
[67:52.26]She knows more about Princess Zelda than I ever did.
[67:55.57]Oh yeah, there's just one more thing I need from you.
[67:57.03]You don't have to worry about this until after you see Impa, but I want you to bring me back some ancient materials.
[68:02.79]Bring them to either me or to Robbie.
[68:07.18]Okay.
[68:10.16]Ancient materials.
[68:23.16]I thought there wasn't enough room.
[68:41.56]How do I put the- put it away!
[68:48.55]Whatever, put it away!
[68:52.24]Traveler's bow?
[69:07.20]Alright, cool.
[69:09.30]So, I got the camera.
[69:11.34]Alright, let's go to the beach.
[69:14.22]So this is what the person took.
[69:29.78]Okay.
[69:35.58]What is this a picture of?
[69:40.19]Is this the same tree five times?
[69:48.25]Oh, you went to Disney on a slow day.
[69:50.13]Holy shit.
[69:50.93]How are there no people in these photos?
[69:54.10]Can you imagine getting a shot like this at Disney?
[70:03.30]Damn.
[70:03.82]Alright.
[70:07.14]Oh, right.
[70:08.04]Okay.
[70:09.20]Now let's play the video game.
[70:15.18]The beach, right?
[70:22.81]It's GeoGuessr.
[70:30.21]Look at that.
[70:31.45]I'm gonna land right on top.
[70:32.61]Oh, wait!
[70:33.05]There's a shrine right there.
[70:34.07]Go back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[70:35.76]I wanna go to that one, too.
[70:37.75]Trying right there.
[70:38.27]I'm going to that one and then I'm going to drop down to that one.
[70:47.55]Perfect.
[70:57.57]That's not that far, right?
[70:59.35]I need a... I need a horse.
[71:00.93]I need a better horse than Frank.
[71:05.20]Frank kind of stinks, guys.
[71:08.84]Frank kind of stinks.
[71:17.17]Zelda took these.
[71:18.07]Be nice.
[71:20.83]I'm just saying, Frank kind of stinks.
[71:23.59]Whenever I try to maneuver around with Frank, you can't turn.
[71:29.06]How many photos am I allowed to have on my camera, by the way?
[71:46.11]Get rid of this shit.
[71:59.58]I only have 48 photos!
[72:02.40]Why would I keep just shitty photos?
[72:05.76]They have to be- I want them to be good.
[72:20.11]This is a little strange, but whatever.
[72:21.67]I don't think I should be able to run up this mountain, but here I am.
[72:31.91]It's raining.
[72:32.47]Oh, come on.
[72:37.77]Okay.
[72:52.48]Make sure you save a slot to take a selfie with Ganon at the end of the game.
[72:58.95]Make sure you take a selfie with Ganon.
[73:00.65]Yep, that's true.
[73:02.19]No, I need to save 48 images so I can just be in front of Ganon and just go like this and just go snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, and have 50 fucking pictures.
[73:22.03]That's such bullshit.
[73:23.85]If it wasn't raining, I'd be fine.
[73:35.43]I'd be fine.
[73:47.43]God, where is he going?
[73:52.28]Alright.
[73:54.20]Look, there's like 17,000 people here.
[73:56.74]You understand that collectively, if you all say the same thing, just the way the world works, I can hear it.
[74:01.35]I can sense it.
[74:04.19]Two or three thousand people at the same exact time just said the same sentence, so it's been manifested.
[74:09.65]I heard it.
[74:14.65]My god, this is actually really far away.
[74:20.21]Whatever.
[74:37.83]Alright, from here... You know what?
[74:43.15]If you're gonna go for it, you have to go for it, right?
[74:48.67]I'm changing my mind.
[75:25.65]Cave with, uh, minerals in it.
[75:50.51]Weather forecast in the bottom right.
[75:52.09]Oh!
[75:53.11]That's interesting.
[76:13.48]Wait, keep old picture?
[76:15.08]Wait, I don't know.
[76:16.59]I want to keep everything.
[76:28.14]How many times is he going to swing?
[76:29.22]Alright, get up and use the soldiers to play more, for the love of God.
[76:35.84]Crush his head.
[76:36.44]Okay.
[76:56.00]Somebody with power, explain it to him, please.
[77:02.74]Somebody with power, explain it to him.
[77:04.91]Quarry, please.
[77:07.17]Alright, this mysterious mineral.
[77:11.21]You can take pictures for specific items.
[77:14.15]In the compendium, yeah.
[77:15.83]That's in addition to the 48 other photos.
[77:18.23]Every item an enemy can have a photo attached.
[77:21.09]They don't take space.
[77:22.79]Okay.
[77:25.22]I get it.
[77:29.27]So you're saying that if I go like this and take a picture of the luminous stone deposit, that this is... Okay.
[77:40.45]This is not a photo now.
[77:45.47]But it says four.
[77:46.15]Look at this bullshit.
[77:48.59]It's up here.
[77:56.56]It's both.
[77:57.18]You can delete it.
[77:57.78]Oh, it's copied over.
[77:59.66]Oh.
[78:02.52]Oh, that's... Okay, I get it.
[78:03.66]Cool.
[78:04.36]Let's go.
[78:11.69]Luminous stones.
[78:14.61]Alright, that's probably worth a lot of money.
[78:16.89]I know they're worth something because chat freaked out when they saw it.
[78:19.25]Hmm.
[78:37.27]Some of those stones!
[78:40.49]Or seeds.
[78:44.39]Thank you!
[78:44.83]Bang, okay.
[79:09.93]Oh, you can see the mountain in the background.
[79:11.01]That's cool.
[79:14.41]I actually don't want to be fighting with this, right?
[79:17.47]It's a mistake.
[79:26.79]Oh, bat wings.
[79:29.69]Can I... What can I do?
[79:31.09]Can I do anything with the light bugs?
[79:45.03]Can you make apple pie?
[79:47.77]I mean, I won't eat it, but I'll make it.
[79:49.03]If we're going to talk about shitty food takes, right?
[79:53.83]I've gone over the I don't like apple pie routine, right?
[79:56.37]Okay, does that one?
[80:02.66]Well, that one's in the middle of the ocean.
[80:19.04]It's not a routine.
[80:22.08]Well, hold on.
[80:22.92]Let me back up a little.
[80:23.74]Let me back up.
[80:27.88]So.
[80:31.13]Apple pie is fine.
[80:32.53]If there's vanilla ice cream on top.
[80:40.32]If there's vanilla ice cream that's on top, it's good.
[80:44.18]And I will eat it.
[80:46.78]Just a slice of apple pie without anything else.
[80:50.42]I don't like it.
[80:53.58]It doesn't taste bad.
[80:56.26]But it needs vanilla ice cream on it.
[81:09.85]My cat just gave birth while we were watching.
[81:13.07]What the fuck?
[81:14.82]Really?
[81:16.38]Damn.
[81:24.30]Where did you get this horse?
[81:25.30]Hold on.
[81:26.22]Can I... Is that Frank?
[81:29.20]That looks like Frank, doesn't it?
[81:50.11]Where do I end up?
[81:56.20]I have a set of armor on and I'm dying in one hit?
[82:07.31]Give me that shrine.
[82:23.34]You got to upgrade the armor.
[82:25.08]Can you actually up that?
[82:26.24]Can you upgrade the armor?
[82:27.02]Because that would be a huge deal.
[82:31.71]You can?
[82:32.47]Okay, that's really cool.
[82:36.83]What's your problem?
[82:38.95]What is your problem?
[82:45.64]Are you going to go over here and do that to this camp?
[82:48.62]Why are you just in a rage?
[83:07.26]Alright, let's go.
[83:35.53]So many.
[83:38.44]God, dude, fucking run.
[83:40.10]Don't go that far.
[83:52.11]Holy shit, they do so much damage.
[84:10.65]Oh my god, just get over there.
[84:20.57]Why did I kill the guy in one hit?
[84:21.53]No, no, no, no, no!
[84:39.82]Fuck!
[84:40.82]Alright, run!
[84:42.08]Run, run!
[84:42.54]I need to eat some apples!
[84:44.79]That guy just fucked everybody over.
[84:50.69]I wish A and B were flipped.
[84:59.76]They're throwing rocks!
[85:12.14]No!
[85:23.81]It's a skill issue.
[85:24.73]I'll show you a skill issue.
[85:25.83]I'm going to take care of this right now.
[85:34.05]What sneak?
[85:38.11]Who cares?
[85:38.69]I'm just throwing a bomb into the eyeball.
[85:40.85]I don't care.
[86:07.80]Oops.
[86:15.91]That's not really hurting them, by the way.
[86:18.91]Alright, I'm taking out the guardian sword.
[86:20.61]For fuck's sake.
[86:22.67]Okay, I'm doing this wrong.
[86:24.61]Everyone's going to make fun of me.
[86:28.94]Everyone's going to make fun of me.
[86:30.12]Because I'm doing this wrong.
[86:31.02]Okay, I've got to take this slow.
[86:37.03]I gotta take this slow and I gotta just relax.
[86:39.95]I'm o- I'm underleveled because look at- look where I am.
[86:43.51]Look where I- I'm so underleveled.
[86:44.27]I should not- I'm supposed to be over here.

[87:20.61]How do you, how do you sneak?
[87:23.15]How do you sneak?
[87:28.97]How do you sneak?
[87:30.97]L3.
[87:31.17]Yeah, watch this.
[87:38.98]I'm dropping a grenade in this thing.
[87:48.98]What are they hearing?
[87:51.24]No, don't come out of the cave.
[87:53.16]Why are they coming out?
[87:57.48]You heard me through concrete?
[88:17.24]God!
[88:25.57]Are we okay?
[88:26.93]Are we okay?
[88:29.95]What happened?
[89:03.21]Now die already!
[89:04.57]Alright, here we go.
[89:05.39]What's up?
[89:13.24]Remember me?
[89:13.88]That didn't even hurt them.
[89:30.37]I can't even hurt this guy.
[89:37.17]That does not hurt at all.
[89:40.49]Um... Wish I had arrows right now.
[89:53.36]They're taunting me.
[89:54.09]Yeah, you're all doing a Fortnite dance.
[89:55.67]Yeah.
[89:56.41]You're all in a party.
[89:57.43]I solo queued.
[89:58.93]I'm sick of solo queuing!
[90:16.04]Shoot the lantern?
[90:19.34]That was a bad voice crack as well, yeah.
[90:24.14]Where's the lantern?
[90:24.80]You mean shoot that lantern up there?
[90:26.92]You got it, bro.
[90:42.47]I didn't do anything.
[90:45.23]That guy helped me more than the lantern.
[90:46.82]Nice fucking keyboard turning, by the way.
[90:59.46]I need to make that faster.
[91:11.61]Okay, how am I gonna kill these guys?
[91:22.80]Check this shit out.
[91:24.10]These guys are fucking dead now.
[91:40.20]That's gonna be one down, right?
[91:41.28]Yep.
[91:48.14]Oh, you're throwing rocks.
[91:51.26]Oh, shit.
[91:52.16]Okay, hold on.
[91:55.28]They're almost dead.
[91:56.06]No.
[91:56.90]They can't take damage from this, really, I don't think.
[92:00.17]Oh, no.
[92:00.99]I was going to say, hope he doesn't get up here.
[92:03.11]Alright, eat something.
[92:44.25]Got him.
[92:44.59]Got him.
[92:46.37]Knight's broadsword.
[92:52.64]Only one more left.
[93:26.27]No weapon, Andy!
[93:26.97]No weapon, Andy!
[93:29.56]I win.
[93:30.30]Thank God.
[93:31.48]Uh-oh.
[93:36.50]Internet problems starting again.
[93:41.22]Nah, I think we're okay.
[93:42.97]We'll see.
[93:52.10]This is another knight's broadsword.
[93:57.96]This thing's almost broken.
[94:00.10]But I want to throw it at somebody.
[94:01.77]So I'm going to get rid of the... Yeah, this thing's a piece of shit.
[94:04.55]Why do I still have this?
[94:05.57]Alright, what's in here?
[94:11.54]This was a pretty tough encounter.
[94:21.56]I mean, that's okay.
[94:31.13]Is this a regular spear?
[94:32.09]Should I just get rid of the guardian sword?
[94:40.85]You can hit really fast with a spear.
[94:43.47]That's literally one of the best weapons in the whole game.
[94:45.45]Really?
[94:45.69]Yeah, I don't need this thing anymore.
[94:56.99]So I'm gonna save this for a little bit.
[94:58.77]I have some pretty good weapons.
[94:59.93]I need more inventory slots.
[95:05.06]Yeah, I do.
[95:06.20]I really do, desperately.
[95:14.17]Another one of these.
[95:15.59]Oh, God.
[95:16.39]Just get rid of this, I guess.
[95:20.00]But this thing's not as good.
[95:21.36]15, 20?
[95:22.58]Is this thing fast?
[95:25.38]This thing's fast.
[95:26.04]What if I need a fast weapon?
[95:27.14]These are slow.
[95:29.16]Yeah.
[95:31.18]The boomerang sucks.
[95:32.46]Get rid of it.
[95:33.82]Alright, I'll get rid of the boomerang.
[95:41.36]Okay, it's a boomerang.
[95:42.42]I forgot.
[95:44.08]That's cool though.
[95:44.75]Let me do that one more time.
[95:55.81]Cool.
[95:58.11]Yeah, these night swords are 26 damage.
[96:05.18]Have you guys ever thrown a boomerang in real life?
[96:10.83]It's actually kind of hard.
[96:13.51]They just... Okay, I have been out in a big open field, right?
[96:19.58]Whipping, just throwing a boomerang as hard as I can, and this shit just goes straight.
[96:23.92]It doesn't come around.
[96:24.98]It doesn't do anything.
[96:28.88]If you throw a boomerang for real, every time I've ever thrown one, it just kind of goes there and falls down.
[96:34.11]It doesn't go all the way around.
[96:38.30]I feel like it'd be terrifying.
[96:39.82]Can you imagine that coming back?
[96:42.23]It'd be like... Like, how do you prepare for that?
[96:46.95]It's just like, oh shit, it's gonna hit me in the head!
[96:50.33]How do you catch a boomerang?
[96:52.71]It's just... It's gonna literally hit you in the head.
[96:56.72]It's gonna kill you.
[97:01.14]You gotta throw it right...
[97:03.65]I would imagine throwing that and you just see it like a hitman briefcase glitching back towards you.
[97:10.66]No, dude, I'm turning around.
[97:11.46]I'm sprinting.
[97:12.32]I'm not gonna get hit by that.
[97:14.48]That's terrifying.
[97:16.88]No way.
[97:17.68]Okay.
[97:24.65]Oh, right, the beach.
[97:27.43]Wait.
[97:28.77]Did I pick up the sword?
[97:34.78]Look at that.
[97:35.98]26, 26, 26.
[97:36.32]I got a lot of damage now.
[97:37.80]I'll go, uh, let's go with this.
[97:39.52]It's the worst one.
[97:43.29]Oh, there's a shrine.
[97:44.21]I forgot about the shrine.
[97:44.93]You're right.
[97:47.89]It's up all the way up, right?
[97:49.15]Yep.
[97:52.40]They really do come back if you throw them right.
[97:54.54]It's scary.
[97:55.14]Yeah, I don't want to do that.
[98:33.70]Can you do anything with the bull?
[98:35.56]You can ride the bull?
[98:37.30]No, you can't.
[98:43.35]Well, it's gone.
[98:47.05]Why are you tan?
[98:47.80]I don't think I'm tan.
[98:50.30]I'm not tan.
[98:53.92]You can ride anything.
[98:55.30]That's awesome.
[99:03.31]Alright, I finally made it.
[99:05.40]We're doing that shrine, then we're doing that shrine, and then I'll go do a main quest.
[99:08.84]Is that a shrine over there?
[99:16.95]You saw that, right?
[99:18.91]Over there?
[99:41.07]Another F. Yeah, I don't get it.
[99:42.81]It's okay.
[99:44.69]It's gonna do this, and then it's gonna... Remember, this is how it works.
[99:47.77]It does this for like 30, 40 minutes, and then doesn't happen again for the rest of the day.
[99:52.74]It just happens.
[99:53.18]I don't get it.
[99:53.72]It's just weird.
[99:54.58]It doesn't matter if it's 2 o'clock in the afternoon, noon, 10 o'clock at night.
[99:58.06]It's just the way it is.
[100:18.87]What's on your right?
[100:19.75]Why do you keep looking on your right?
[100:20.97]Okay, on my right, I have... So I have a thing that tells me how many frames I drop right there on this monitor.
[100:28.75]I have mod chat.
[100:30.47]And then I also have the stream preview is up that way.
[100:33.16]So like, well, not the stream preview, but the device that I'm streaming with.
[100:38.04]So I'm usually looking... If you see me looking over here, I'm looking at what's the stream health or mod chat.
[100:43.82]If I'm looking over here, I'm reading you, your chat.
[100:53.22]I got a whole battle station here.
[100:56.07]Okay, so let's go.
[101:05.47]What's this puzzle?
[101:11.54]Computer, please play Celery Man.
[101:14.70]It's the same music.
[101:29.02]broken already.
[101:43.01]But this doesn't fucking hurt.
[101:44.25]No, don't take a picture.
[101:45.15]I'm dead.
[101:50.53]Instantly.
[101:51.25]Okay.
[101:51.69]I gotta probably parry it.
[102:00.33]It's a parry, right?
[102:01.11]It's definitely a parry.
[102:01.85]It's a... So parry is... How do you do parry?
[102:15.00]You have to be... Have the shield equipped.
[102:20.86]How do I put the shield?
[102:21.42]How do I put... Okay.
[102:23.24]And then it's... This and R1?
[102:26.00]This and... How do you parry?
[102:26.96]How do you parry?
[102:29.52]I have a shield out.
[102:33.72]And is it... How do you parry?
[102:40.87]Computer, please play Celery Man, please.
[102:42.99]Okay.
[102:56.57]You broke my shit!
[103:27.70]Okay, let's go.
[103:57.18]I'm barely hurting this thing.
[104:29.84]Can you I can't bury that?
[104:30.84]OK.
[104:47.85]I just have to fight.
[104:54.09]This is not worth it, to be honest.
[105:05.46]Okay, so when it goes like... He goes... I dodged it.
[105:14.58]You saw me jump in the air.
[105:15.61]I fucking dodged that.
[105:18.23]I actually did.
[105:32.71]Everything is breaking against this person.
[106:00.25]Flurry Rush incoming!
[106:01.51]Dude, that didn't fucking even hurt him.
[106:17.19]I'm just breaking all my weapons on this.
[106:21.93]This is actually terrible.
[106:23.19]I'm gonna break all my weapons.
[106:24.99]Everything's gonna break.
[106:29.32]free weapon I'm gonna all this cool stuff use the best weapons I feel like is this this is bad
[107:26.30]I was gonna say, what the fuck was that?
[107:34.95]Where's my flurry, Rush?
[107:36.03]Excuse me!
[108:10.32]I thought you had to interrupt it.
[108:12.36]I thought I had to land on top of him to interrupt it.
[108:19.36]Alright, I got it.
[108:20.10]We'll be good.
[108:24.23]I got it now.
[108:24.99]I got it now.
[108:25.49]This is it.
[108:25.75]This is the one.
[108:29.61]That usually works.
[108:30.17]You're bad.
[108:33.25]Never mind.
[108:41.70]I play too much Dark Souls.
[108:49.62]I pressed R3 to lock on.
[109:08.67]Flurry rush incoming!
[109:09.63]Oh my goodness.
[109:48.79]Okay.
[110:34.41]Whoa, whoa, wait, what does this do?
[110:35.43]It says stealth boost?
[110:43.71]Jump and open the parachute!
[111:05.62]No, don't do it again.
[112:01.98]Ah!
[112:31.74]I'm not getting one hit killed.
[112:32.89]Just eat the gross food and puke.
[112:33.85]I don't care.
[113:06.24]Go ahead, do it again, do it again.
[113:08.38]You have to be directly on top of his fucking head.
[113:26.33]Do it again!
[113:29.21]You piece of crap!
[113:31.19]Wait, this is different.
[113:35.20]Am I safe behind this?
[113:37.02]I'm safe behind this, right?
[113:38.22]There's no way I'm going to be.
[113:39.46]I'm alright behind this, right?
[113:40.62]Am I dead?
[113:50.57]Shoot it in the face!
[113:54.08]Okay, do I have any more food?
[113:57.50]I'm fucked.
[114:07.09]Just eat the snails?
[114:15.10]Dude, I don't understand!
[114:16.82]Wait, you need to eat something quick!
[114:44.43]I think I'm dead.
[115:07.33]I didn't know when he was gonna fire!
[115:10.35]I didn't know!
[115:11.07]I didn't know when he was gonna shoot it!
[115:19.19]Okay, I get it now.
[115:20.59]It's over this time.
[115:22.23]You're so bad it hurts.
[115:24.19]I have never fought these things.
[115:25.88]This is the first time I've ever fought one of these.
[115:28.72]Of course I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
[115:30.24]How am I supposed to know?
[115:32.68]I don't have the knowledge of beating this before.
[115:38.03]I don't know what the laser does.
[116:29.60]Why is that not working?
[116:32.24]That was a perfect... Joink!
[116:35.90]It's backwards, not sideways?
[116:37.42]Wait, you can only do it when it's backwards?
[116:39.24]Only a backflip does that.
[116:41.24]Wait, only a backflip.
[116:46.04]What?
[116:47.96]I thought it was just you if you dodged it either side.
[116:50.90]I thought it was like doesn't didn't matter as long as you got a perfect dodge.
[116:55.06]It's only on backwards.
[116:59.38]With a horizontal attack because there's no iframes.
[117:18.26]You guys are kidding me.
[117:19.44]Alright, so I did I thought it did I didn't think it mattered I did alright.
[117:28.02]I didn't know I thought those iframes
[117:47.83]Thank you for watching
[118:45.91]Okay, I got it!
[119:17.06]Holy shit, Ancient Battle Axe Plus?
[119:21.62]What?
[119:26.04]And Guardian Shield Plus?
[119:29.31]No way.
[119:32.05]No, put this away.
[119:32.77]I'm literally never using these until the last boss fight.
[119:50.37]Something else in here too.
[119:55.21]Whoa.
[120:00.58]Better not be.
[120:14.18]No, I don't want to do that.
[120:16.28]I want to throw the bow.
[120:28.15]Just drop it.
[120:33.01]This game's fun.
[120:33.88]I like it.
[120:35.34]That was a challenge.
[120:36.34]It took me a minute to figure it out, but I got it.
[120:39.34]This is fun.
[120:48.54]Cool.
[120:52.17]I think that's my second one, yeah.
[120:55.33]Got a shrine right down here, by the way.
[121:04.59]Shrine down here.
[121:17.51]Before I get out of here, it's something else I should look up.
[121:20.57]Check out up here.
[121:23.05]This kind of sits alone on the mountaintop here.
[121:27.76]Was this Tinoco Island?
[121:30.60]I think that's where I'm going.
[121:37.26]I think that's actually where I'm going right now.
[121:40.12]Yeah, it definitely is.
[121:40.80]Oh, alright.
[121:51.10]I want that shrine.
[122:21.28]Saving on stamina.
[122:32.69]Okay.
[122:36.11]Cool.
[122:36.49]There's a boat here.
[122:38.11]Can I use this?
[122:48.66]Does this just look cool?
[122:54.37]Ooh, there's a... Who cares?
[122:57.59]Coconuts or anything?
[122:59.27]There are coconuts!
[123:00.05]What?
[123:00.21]Dude, there's coconuts.
[123:08.05]Let's go.
[123:22.55]Trying time.
[123:39.05]Use the leaf?
[123:41.87]I can use the leaf to move the boat?
[123:43.73]Alright, let's go.
[124:04.31]Combat trial, oh god.
[124:06.64]Another one of these?
[124:10.79]Is it the same?
[124:14.77]It's another one of those Guardian things.
[124:16.53]Okay, it's the same thing.
[124:17.43]Just do it again.
[124:18.83]I just have to do it again.
[124:22.13]You have an extra weapon.
[124:22.87]That's fine. ...
[124:55.17]I'm gonna run out of weapons, I think.
[124:56.67]This is bad.
[125:37.57]Can I hurt?
[125:38.40]Don't!
[125:38.76]I just blew up one of the things!
[125:40.08]Oh.
[125:40.60]My.
[125:41.22]God.
[125:42.38]Every button in my brain is remapped to Dark Souls.
[125:47.58]R1 is attack.
[125:50.78]R3 is dodge.
[125:52.10]I mean, is it lock on?
[125:54.08]I have Dark Souls brain.
[125:59.00]It's genuinely Dark Souls brain.
[126:05.32]Should I use this thing?
[126:06.14]And just like, fuck this guy up?
[126:15.65]Yeah.
[126:37.62]Ooh, pretty good.
[126:39.32]I'm gonna scream as loud as I fucking can.
[126:47.10]I thought that was gonna be vertical.
[127:20.21]Use that.
[127:20.88]Why?
[127:21.08]It's not gonna help at all.
[127:54.35]I pressed left!
[127:58.19]I'm pressing left and dodge!
[127:59.87]Why am I jumping backwards?
[128:01.15]Skintroller sucks!
[128:23.65]Dude, I hate the Joy-Con.
[128:28.33]My YouTube angry voice is doing pretty good, right?
[128:45.98]I'm not trying to jump backwards.
[128:47.24]Why does it keep doing that?
[128:48.08]I swear to God.
[128:54.94]Is it drift?
[128:58.97]No, it's not the drift.
[129:13.73]Use the pro controller?
[129:15.71]Why?
[129:16.77]I don't want to buy something else and use it.
[129:19.31]Because they didn't package the better controller in.
[129:21.83]I'm not going to buy the pro controller for the Switch.
[129:24.99]Two of them.
[129:37.92]You're doing a Kubrick stare every time you play?
[129:41.10]Sitting there like this.
[129:45.22]See if I can beat this guy with the Kubrick Stare.
[130:35.48]I don't know what that means.
[130:41.60]Oh God, run.
[130:46.64]It is?
[130:51.44]What?
[131:01.99]It's broken?
[131:02.69]It's broken.
[131:08.83]Oh shit, that's bad.
[131:13.10]He's not even halfway.

[135:26.69]Just run in a circle.
[135:29.41]Parry it.
[135:30.07]I'm not going to parry this.
[135:31.33]I don't have the skill for that.
[135:34.25]Parry or run around.
[135:35.31]I'm going to run around.

[138:21.30]I got the diamond sword.
[138:22.22]I got the diamond hoe even.
[138:25.23]I'm loaded.
[138:41.02]Save that core.
[138:42.06]Do not cook it.
[138:43.26]Don't sell it.
[138:44.06]Don't eat it.
[138:45.10]Why would I eat the core?
[138:46.30]You can eat it?
[138:48.80]Don't cook that.
[138:50.28]The mods are... I'm getting a lot of mod help here.
[138:53.69]I was told do not cook that or sell that.
[138:56.59]Okay.

[139:11.91]Ooh.
[139:17.18]Really?

[139:27.19]I got the climbing gear.
[139:31.53]This is really, I can sell this now.
[139:35.11]Alright, cool.
[139:40.37]That's way better.
[139:40.95]There's only one defense less and I get the climbing ability?
[139:52.24]I'm gonna call me a shit eater.
[140:02.43]Cool.
[140:08.57]Who said that?
[140:10.83]I'm not gonna, I don't know.
[140:12.31]They're in here somewhere.
[140:15.97]If you get the full climbing set, you go much faster.
[140:21.59]Starting to understand this game now.
[140:23.21]Starting to get it.
[140:26.29]No, I get it.
[140:27.03]I get it.

[140:40.25]Who's that?
[140:50.97]OK, I want to get on the boat.
[141:01.24]Saying I can get on the boat and do this, right?
[141:24.28]Wouldn't this work?
[141:25.34]Wouldn't it go this way?
[141:32.58]Wouldn't it... That's... This is how it would work.
[141:38.98]The air would be moving this way, right?
[141:43.71]Oh, it has to go toward...
[141:49.07]Okay, alright, alright.
[141:49.79]I'm thinking of like a jet propulsion.
[141:52.23]I was like, I'm going to aim this way and go air that way, so we go this way.
[141:55.88]Like an octopus swims.
[141:58.04]Alright, where am I?
[142:00.26]Oh, over to the island.
[142:00.94]Let's go.

[144:02.98]How do I haul that up?
[144:08.88]Just sort of ram it?

[148:35.32]In your travels, you've relied on the equipment you've found along the way.
[148:40.92]Here, you must cast this equipment aside and face this trial with only your wits and whatever you can scavenge.
[148:50.77]Offer up the orbs to the three altars on this island.
[148:53.01]Only then will I acknowledge your skill and return your items.

[154:24.96]Oh stop.
[154:27.82]Oh no, what is that?
[154:45.78]He's got the ball on his neck.
[154:50.38]Wait a minute.
[154:51.36]Can I, like, sneak onto him?
[154:53.53]And, like, steal it?
[154:56.41]No!
[154:56.83]Put it away!
[154:57.35]Put this away!
[154:57.77]Put this away!
[154:58.19]Just put it out!
[155:21.96]I definitely like sneak up behind him and like undo it and take it, right?
[155:59.10]I don't have a bow.
[156:13.95]Whoa, what is that?
[156:14.77]I just got something cool.
[156:15.45]24, damn, okay.
[156:37.66]So I don't think I can kill this guy.
[156:45.97]The bow dropped out though.
[156:50.56]It looks like there's something attached.
[156:52.56]It's connected to something.
[156:53.58]It's attached to something.
[157:27.11]Get him in the eye.
[157:27.59]Get him in the eye.
[157:50.33]Oh, no, no, no, no.

[158:48.32]God damn it.
[158:53.66]Fuck.
[158:59.10]Oh, I got all my stuff back.
[159:00.10]I don't think I can do this right now.
[159:01.02]Should I try it again?
[159:06.39]What if I don't go talk to that thing?
[159:08.75]What if I just... Okay, I got an idea.
[159:09.91]What if I'm just on the island?
[159:11.52]Watch this.
[159:13.30]I'm not going to go talk to that.
[159:14.84]I'm going to go on the island.
[159:15.64]I'm going to go up to him with my guardian axe and I'm going to chop his fucking head off.
[159:19.55]Watch this.
[159:37.42]Never mind.
[159:49.51]Alright.
[159:52.71]Offer up the orbs to the three altars on this island.
[159:57.22]So there's an orb on that troll's neck.
[160:02.16]First of all, let's collect the items from before.
[160:06.03]And crabs and shit.

[162:30.34]I'm trying to grab on to the branch, the tree.
[162:51.93]God damn it!
[162:54.11]Oh my God, game over.
[162:55.77]I don't know.
[162:56.42]I'm not supposed to be here.
[162:57.26]I'm supposed to be here in like 30 fucking hours.
[163:00.44]I'm not supposed to be on this island.
[163:02.88]I'm not supposed to be here.
[163:09.32]You can do this.
[163:10.16]Yes, you can.
[163:10.76]You can do it.
[163:14.27]Well, first things first, let me eat the food that I have.
[163:16.79]So, cause I know it's going to go away.
[163:33.33]Shit!
[163:35.22]I don't have any more of my special drink!
[163:44.38]This is a puzzle, man.
[163:46.22]You can survive.
[163:46.80]You can do it.
[163:47.22]Alright, I'm gonna try.
[163:54.02]Dude, don't worry.
[163:54.89]This game is like Reese's.
[163:56.11]There's no wrong way to eat it.
[163:57.31]There are wrong ways to eat Reese's.
[163:59.59]I don't buy this like, oh, what I do is I put my tongue and push it through and I take the middle out with my tongue and then I eat that.
[164:06.05]No, just eat it normally.
[164:08.01]There is a wrong way to eat a Reese's.
[164:09.29]Just eat it.
[164:11.07]What I do is I bite one half and then I put the other half in my pocket for two days.
[164:15.53]No, just eat the fucking Reese's.
[164:17.65]Eat it.
[164:21.39]What was that?
[164:27.21]Where did they come from?
[164:27.99]I don't understand where they came from.
[164:40.96]Polly said, I'll make you a brain juice if you want.
[164:59.39]Um, hmm.
[165:01.78]Should I have a brain juice?
[165:06.04]Maybe I should.
[165:11.83]You already finished your first brain juice.
[165:13.71]Yes, I did.
[165:14.27]I did have my first brain juice of the afternoon.
[165:33.17]Sounds good.
[165:34.29]Alright, I'm gonna do what I did before.
[165:50.34]Here's what I did before.
[165:52.90]I attacked this camp and I got a bunch of equipment.
[166:05.54]So I gotta get the equipment.
[166:12.41]The problem is I got really lucky last time because I threw the... Just get in.
[166:15.99]Just get in and do it quick before they get their items.
[166:17.81]Okay.
[166:22.85]Alright.
[166:23.21]We're good.
[166:30.99]All this shit is now mine.
[166:40.69]There's a chest here too?
[166:43.53]This wasn't here last time.
[166:44.37]Where did this come from?
[166:47.85]Oh, no, there was.
[166:48.51]Okay, yeah, there was.
[166:50.79]Alright, now let's do this.
[167:05.44]You shoot me with something, I'm gonna be pissed.
[167:07.70]Okay, what is gonna heal me the most?

[167:31.42]I'm good to go.
[167:32.00]There's fish over here and I'm going to get all of them.
[167:38.71]I can cook these.
[167:41.66]I didn't get one.
[167:42.30]Are you kidding me?
[167:43.76]I'm gonna drown.
[167:47.37]I'm gonna fucking drown.
[167:50.17]The ground is right there, Link.
[167:51.37]Just put your feet down.
[168:16.21]Give me the fish!
[168:22.49]You can't even swim over here!
[168:24.11]Okay.
[168:27.60]Is this a chest in the ground?
[168:33.64]There's a chest in the ground right here.
[168:42.44]You better not kill me.
[168:56.51]Good!
[168:58.25]Fuck off!

[169:26.60]We're good.
[169:35.97]Alright, there's some weird shit going on over here.
[169:41.04]Can you see me?
[169:45.14]Oh my goodness.

[172:08.83]See you later.
[172:09.33]Punk.
[172:13.47]Alright, safe.

[173:57.86]Wait, wait, wait.
[173:58.50]Oh my god.
[174:06.21]He's coming the long way.
[174:06.97]He's coming the long way.
[174:09.95]I can't believe that just missed.
[174:20.29]Come on, dude!
[174:27.54]These don't even hurt!
[175:16.78]I can do it already!
[175:41.89]I can do it to it, but I can't... Am I not close enough?
[175:51.06]If I stop time, will it like, will it choke him?
[175:54.72]Or something, right?
[175:56.42]Magnet?
[176:04.41]No.
[176:06.49]I can cook here.
[176:07.49]Shit.
[176:11.11]I'm out of here.
[176:16.66]I have time to look under the rocks.
[176:37.10]I think he went back to sleep up there.
[176:38.12]Okay.
[176:47.57]So what do I do about this guy?
[176:49.05]Something up here.
[177:19.18]finally I got a bow alright there's no arrows why didn't I pick no I didn't
[178:02.17]Thank you.
[178:41.41]I'll figure it out later.
[178:42.69]I'll come back later.
[178:43.33]It's fine.
[178:45.35]I'm not supposed to do everything.
[178:48.25]Nobody in the chat blames you?
[178:51.03]No, I know.
[178:52.51]We're good.
[178:53.88]I'll come back later.
[178:56.40]It's part of the game.
[178:59.14]I'm fine.
[178:59.92]I'm not mad or anything.
[179:03.08]Alright, so what's the actual quest line?
[179:10.47]Alright.
[179:16.02]This one.
[179:17.18]Oh wait, what about, should I do one of the divine beasts?
[179:20.24]Where do I do that?
[179:20.82]Oh my god.
[179:31.07]Okay, so the closest one is here.
[179:35.55]Is it too early?
[179:41.87]Is it too early to make my way over here and do one of these?
[179:45.18]I gotta go this way.
[179:52.00]You can do it?
[179:52.50]Alright, I'll try it.
[179:54.14]Let me get a stamp.
[179:55.56]So I can see where I'm going.
[179:57.97]I'm gonna head that way.
[179:58.83]Where's my horse?
[180:03.01]I actually need my horse.
[180:04.23]I need a horse for something, right?
[180:07.15]I can sell a lot of shit.
[180:12.09]Let me just prepare.
[180:24.29]Hold on.
[180:24.53]I gotta get my brain juice.
[180:28.05]Actually, I'm gonna take a piss too.
[180:29.59]I'll be back in like two minutes.
[182:50.66]Yeah, no, thank you.
[182:53.26]No, this is good.
[182:53.72]This is great.
[182:55.36]Yeah, I just fucking have to pretend to like this fucking shitty game still.
[182:59.85]Thank you.
[183:01.47]No, it tastes good.
[183:04.21]Let me just unmute.
[183:09.19]Hey, what's up?
[183:09.89]I'm back, everybody.
[183:12.84]Ready?
[183:13.02]I'm excited.
[183:15.08]Okay.
[183:32.45]I've done that stupid routine so many times.
[183:35.71]Come on.
[183:36.15]You're not gonna fall for it for like the 10th time, are you?
[183:43.19]I do it all the time.
[183:45.17]I do it so much that it's probably... You can probably tell at this point.
[183:52.18]Alright.
[183:52.88]Can I get confirmed from the Gaming Andes?
[183:57.47]That I can sell these opals.
[184:00.31]I can sell these luminous stones and shit.
[184:03.59]I can just get rid of these.
[184:04.55]I don't need them right now.
[184:06.13]It's just money.
[184:15.64]Keep one of each.
[184:16.42]Okay.
[184:16.95]Okay.
[184:26.47]I'm going to keep more than one of each.
[184:27.93]I don't think I really need the money like that bad.
[184:40.84]What else?
[184:41.12]What can I even buy with this?
[184:46.30]Is there something I could buy?
[184:47.62]What about a bunch of arrows?
[184:50.13]How come you're playing from a library?
[184:58.42]What do you mean?
[185:04.79]Yeah, I'm gonna get arrows.
[185:07.49]But there's also stuff here, too.
[185:08.71]Okay, this is milk.
[185:12.19]Ingredients.
[185:12.85]Soups.
[185:14.97]Mushrooms.
[185:16.70]Truffles.
[185:17.22]Oh, people were talking about truffles.
[185:19.02]Eggs.
[185:20.44]Rice.
[185:20.76]Okay.
[185:21.26]Should I get some milk?
[185:25.58]Alright, I'll get some milk.
[185:29.81]Oh.
[185:31.03]Three?
[185:37.68]Why?
[185:37.82]We're talking about a library.
[185:42.04]What do you mean?
[185:45.20]Oh.
[185:46.26]Okay.
[185:46.76]Should I... Should I get milk, eggs, and... Can I make a cake or something?
[185:51.40]Oh.
[186:03.48]Alright, so if I do milk, eggs, and flour, or... I wonder.
[186:09.62]Oh, arrows.
[186:10.02]Here we go.
[186:11.50]Bomb arrows.
[186:14.60]Alright, I'm gonna buy a shitload of arrows.
[186:16.12]Alright.
[186:23.64]Ten bomb arrows.
[186:24.70]I'll take... Yeah, let's go.
[186:27.42]Oh.
[186:30.62]It's sugar.
[186:31.18]Milk, eggs, and wheat.
[186:33.22]Will that work?
[186:42.73]Who sells sugar?
[186:43.39]That's rice.
[186:52.04]Well, I'm kind of out of money anyways.
[187:00.89]Ah, this is a weapon shop.
[187:03.19]Oh, no.
[187:05.56]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[187:12.16]Alright.
[187:18.89]You need wheat, cane sugar, goat butter, and an apple to make apple pie.
[187:23.85]This person has a quest.
[187:28.74]Wasn't I supposed to go to the beach for somebody and I forgot completely?
[187:31.66]Oh, right.
[187:44.28]Should I do that?
[187:44.96]Okay, there's probably a treasure on the mountain.
[187:51.05]Mysterious place.
[187:54.13]Alright, add it to the list.
[187:57.54]Are you reading?
[187:58.10]But I'm sneezing.
[188:02.01]And very shortly.
[188:16.67]Take one picture of everything.
[188:18.75]That's what I'm being told.
[188:26.94]Everything like even the grass What does it not know
[189:01.26]Why is it still saying question mark?
[189:30.28]Okay, there's a donkey over here.
[189:31.50]Okay, donkey.
[189:39.67]Spoon.
[189:58.69]Okay, let me make a... You need that?
[190:00.69]Yes, I do.
[190:01.87]Take it.
[190:02.65]I'll explain to the villagers you eat your fill.
[190:05.69]Alright, let me cook some stuff.
[190:06.65]What do we got?
[190:07.09]I know I have at least a few things to make.
[190:09.57]Alright, snail.
[190:12.50]Okay, steak.
[190:20.64]Fish.
[190:22.60]Steak.
[190:23.97]Milk and eggs.
[190:27.39]Steak and fruit.
[190:31.95]Steak and apple was pretty good, right?
[190:34.55]Steak and salt.
[190:37.61]Okay.
[190:38.60]Steak, salt.
[190:40.44]More than one salt.
[190:44.06]Milk, steak.
[190:47.48]Should I do it?
[190:48.56]Milk.
[190:52.28]And truffle.
[190:54.12]Truffle oil.
[191:00.64]um hold on five times salt
[191:31.45]Wasn't a fire.
[191:32.43]Hold on.
[191:38.93]Why isn't a fire?
[191:39.65]How do I get?
[191:44.66]You need a light.
[191:48.98]Why would there not be any light source or anything over here?
[191:55.78]You can use Flint.
[192:06.81]How do I use it?
[192:09.01]Strike it with a metallic weapon to generate a spark.
[192:16.40]It has to be on the ground?
[192:34.28]Okay, steak and a bunch of salt.
[192:47.51]What a fucking waste of ingredients.
[192:50.65]Why did somebody tell me to do that?
[192:58.76]That was such a stupid thing to do.
[193:00.58]Alright, how about this?
[193:04.69]Cooking this into a meal unlocks the potential of these nutrients.
[193:08.57]Can I do fish and honey?
[193:09.39]Should I just cook them individually?
[193:16.47]Should these always be cooked individually?
[193:18.33]Don't mix effects.
[193:19.71]Okay.
[193:21.87]So, but if I go like this with one fish, it's going to be one heart.
[193:27.93]Or will it be better?
[193:28.73]That's two.
[193:30.03]Okay.
[193:30.34]So then two fish would be four hearts, right?
[193:38.62]And I'll put a mushroom in there.
[193:39.50]Why not?
[193:50.02]Okay.
[193:58.15]Honey and... Alright, there's another fish.
[194:02.65]Okay.
[194:05.01]When it's cooked into a dish, it increases your attack power.
[194:07.53]So let's do that.
[194:12.19]Another mushroom?
[194:13.47]We can't do two, right?
[194:18.79]Fish, honey, and apples.
[194:20.99]Will this be good?
[194:25.35]Don't mix stats.
[194:30.18]So this is stamina.
[194:34.36]This is also stamina.
[194:37.96]This is just fine.
[194:42.62]This has nuts.
[194:45.54]And then this is attack power.
[194:48.60]So I don't want to do that.
[194:56.69]Okay.
[195:00.27]Defense.
[195:02.67]Stamina.
[195:03.73]So this would be huge.
[195:06.66]Let's try this.
[195:16.55]Whoa.
[195:20.56]That's cool.
[195:26.06]So this is stealth.
[195:27.70]So this is stealth.
[195:31.78]Any more stealth?
[195:38.85]Any more stealth food?
[195:39.65]Heart recovery.
[195:47.13]Maximum hearts.
[195:49.37]This is just eggs.
[195:56.99]I'll put some wheat in there too.
[196:09.32]Stealth boost.
[196:11.02]Sneaky fried egg and rice.
[196:12.46]Maybe I should just make a few of these.
[196:20.62]Right.
[196:22.44]And then.
[196:22.86]Attack power.
[196:36.78]Yep.
[196:39.41]More.
[196:41.17]Add salt to.
[196:47.07]More eggs.
[196:47.85]I have eggs, don't I?
[196:49.43]Yeah.
[196:51.70]Double salt.
[196:54.54]Double wheat.
[196:59.59]Add some bacon in it.
[197:05.49]And an apple.
[197:17.20]Nice.
[197:19.76]Okay, I'm gonna have a lot of good food.
[197:22.48]Egg.
[197:24.42]Milk.
[197:25.80]Salt.
[197:28.10]Wheat.
[197:31.12]Fish.
[197:32.64]This is defense.
[197:33.36]It's gonna be huge.
[197:42.77]Five minutes of defense.
[197:50.92]Someone said, cook an individual truffle.
[197:55.54]Make a creamy mushroom risotto.
[198:00.28]Oh, wow.
[198:01.14]Holy shit.
[198:05.49]Why wouldn't I just only do this?
[198:06.81]Are you kidding me?
[198:12.33]That's insane.
[198:15.27]Full recovery?
[198:20.68]And two spirit hearts.
[198:25.24]What about this shit?
[198:28.84]Increase your heart recovery when used as an ingredient.
[198:31.08]Alright, so let's do two of these.
[198:35.64]Some milk.
[198:36.38]An egg.
[198:36.66]And another glass of milk.
[198:40.34]Let's make a... Let's make a coconut stew.
[198:48.42]Wait.
[198:48.74]Hold on.
[198:52.45]Let me put some salt in it.
[198:53.81]No, no salt.
[198:54.41]This is going to be like a cake.
[198:57.73]Milk, fruit, and egg.
[198:59.41]It's going to be like a stew.
[199:01.17]And I made an omelet.
[199:05.87]Okay.
[199:13.31]What does this do?
[199:13.67]Alright, well, fuck it.
[199:20.97]Whatever.
[199:21.17]I'll just do this.
[199:29.48]Very good.
[199:30.76]Now I'm ready.
[199:31.72]Look at all the food I have now.
[199:32.60]I mean, some of the stuff is gross, but that's fine.
[199:36.25]I have so much stuff now.
[199:40.25]Thank God.
[199:42.91]Okay.
[199:44.89]Now that I'm prepared that way, it's time to move to the Divine Beast.
[199:56.99]Press please sort it.
[199:57.90]Press Y to sort.
[200:05.06]It didn't do anything.
[200:09.68]Is it by rarity or something?
[200:15.91]Go level up.
[200:19.33]Oh, do I have four?
[200:20.47]I think I only have three.
[200:29.00]What about the beach quest?
[200:32.73]Shit.
[200:34.27]Yeah, alright, I'll do the beach quest.
[200:36.71]Fine, I'll do the beach quest.
[201:02.46]Let's go.
[201:06.52]Preparation is the most important thing in Breath of the Wild.
[201:08.34]That's what I've been told.
[201:12.01]Attack buffs are great for bosses of a tough enemy camp.
[201:16.29]Also, you're doing way too much healing for your current HP.
[201:19.58]Cook smaller dishes so you're not wasting ingredients.
[201:21.94]Oh, that's right.
[201:22.42]I didn't think about that.
[201:30.05]Yeah, one of those is it heals 10 hearts.
[201:32.76]That's a little too much, I think.
[201:36.82]Can you sing me a lullaby?
[201:37.76]Yeah, I think so.
[201:38.30]I think I could sing you a lullaby.
[201:46.45]Say goodnight and goodnight.
[201:51.31]And...
[201:59.03]We're floating all the way there.
[202:28.23]That's... Somebody just said that's the final straw.
[202:35.41]What are you talking about?
[202:36.37]Uh-oh, I have not been paying... Oh, I gotta do this.
[202:46.00]Oh, it worked.
[202:49.12]Alright, dude, that's the last straw.
[202:50.66]I'm out of here.
[202:56.78]Okay, so let's do it.
[202:58.42]I'm ready.
[202:59.38]I got some good weapons.
[203:03.17]Maybe I should eat one of the stamina foods.
[203:32.93]Why are you fighting me?
[203:34.27]What are they doing?
[203:35.09]I'm trying to save them.
[203:36.22]Holy shit, that hurt.
[204:15.34]Oh my god, your reach is insane!
[204:48.94]Ooh.
[204:58.92]What the fuck?
[205:16.63]Enhanced little spear.
[205:24.28]Okay, so now what have I got?
[205:25.61]I gotta get rid of some of this shit.
[205:34.49]I'll use it.
[205:36.37]Spears are really good.
[205:37.07]This one seems really good.
[205:37.93]Okay.
[205:53.23]I still have so much trouble judging how far this goes.
[205:55.69]Don't even think about it.
[206:32.73]My God, that's fucking such a... What a YouTuber.
[206:35.88]Seriously, like, honest to God.
[206:37.98]Don't fucking die because you're a YouTuber.
[207:03.72]got it so now I believe
[207:34.98]How do I get them to come back?
[207:38.48]Well, I'll deal with them in a second.
[207:44.34]Can I, like, move them?
[207:48.86]Ooh, nice.
[207:49.56]Good.
[207:58.26]Gold fruit again?
[207:59.13]Uh-huh.
[208:07.07]Alright, so what do I do with the sheep?
[208:36.72]How do you get the sheep to move?
[208:47.08]Something else to do?
[208:47.74]I freaked out.
[208:56.68]It's okay.
[208:57.62]Wait, this is meat.
[208:59.30]Oh, man.
[209:00.02]Meat.
[209:13.49]What's the... Where's the marker going?
[209:15.80]Wait, did I do it?
[209:18.34]Did I do it?
[209:27.14]Oh.
[209:29.18]Okay.
[209:30.79]Where's this one?
[209:35.33]That's up here.
[209:35.81]Alright, I'm going to go back and turn this all in.
[209:54.41]Will you please?
[209:59.70]Go back and talk to her.
[210:07.08]Well, that's definitely what I should be doing.
[210:09.88]Travel.
[210:25.05]I need a new horse so bad.
[210:36.04]I need a horse so bad.
[210:37.94]What's the shirt?
[210:39.62]Andy Mark.
[210:42.76]Whatever.
[210:43.18]Yeah, I'm wearing my whatever shirt.
[210:57.02]Alright, so what do you need?
[211:02.97]Something good?
[211:04.01]What am I doing here?
[211:06.81]Ancient materials.
[211:07.83]Oh!
[211:10.33]Three ancient screws to power up your sensor.
[211:13.77]Ancient shaft to power up your remote bombs.
[211:16.29]Ancient cores.
[211:18.03]Oh, man.
[211:19.03]Alright.
[211:21.69]I have all that stuff.
[211:27.30]Yeah, let's do it.
[211:32.67]Okay.
[211:35.87]Definitely remote bomb.
[211:39.16]I use that all the time.
[211:39.92]Okay.
[212:08.49]I use bombs all the time.
[212:12.73]A lot.
[212:13.09]I'm a big bomb, Zelda bomb fan.
[212:20.67]Dude, she installed root on your phone.
[212:29.04]Okay.
[212:40.67]So, what's another good one?
[212:44.81]Um, how many... Is this what you do with this stuff, or is there other things you can do with the ancient materials?
[212:56.47]Stasis or the sensor?
[212:57.43]Let's do them all if I can.
[213:00.17]There are other things.
[213:01.13]Okay.
[213:02.49]I'll do stasis.
[213:03.11]I use stasis pretty frequently.
[213:04.19]I don't have it.
[213:08.38]Oh.
[213:11.89]How about the sensor?
[213:12.47]Yeah, let's do it.
[213:26.43]Go talk to the sheep owner?
[213:31.59]Yeah, I'm just getting this out of the way.
[213:43.39]This is, um... I like games like this because I feel like I haven't done anything, but I feel like I've done a lot.
[213:51.66]I feel like I have not done a single thing yet.
[213:54.26]But somehow I am.
[214:00.02]Okay.
[214:03.56]If your sensor has been augmented to search for things other than shrines, it reacts when you are close to the thing you have set it to look for.
[214:14.14]So you can make it look for other stuff.
[214:16.84]Okay.
[214:20.12]Cool.
[214:23.54]You can now search for anything you take a picture of.
[214:25.24]That's why you're taking the photos.
[214:27.60]Oh.
[214:30.68]Cool.
[214:34.84]That's actually really helpful.
[214:39.96]Alright.
[214:41.88]The Sheikah Sensor Plus.
[214:43.06]I really want to see it.
[214:48.43]Take a look.
[214:58.71]Picture of a sun shroom with the camera.
[215:37.86]I'm pressing B, but you have to hit X. B is universal back.
[215:49.90]I did get one.
[215:50.64]Okay.
[215:54.90]Using that in the rain.
[215:55.82]Yeah, that's probably a bad idea.
[216:06.56]okay give me three sun shrooms so alright so here we are the album we're looking for that's these are not pictures of the bows they're pictures of me
[216:48.38]Okay.
[216:50.30]So target with sensor.
[216:55.08]Searching for sun shrooms.
[216:56.16]Okay.
[217:00.91]So that's going to blink when I'm near a sun shroom now.
[217:04.23]Very interesting.
[217:07.93]Yep, the one back here.
[217:19.29]Sounds room.
[217:20.89]Alright, so then now we just have to look for him.
[217:26.23]Oh.
[217:29.53]That's I like that feature a lot.
[217:30.99]That's cool.
[217:39.66]Another one over here.
[217:57.95]Go to that light.
[217:58.81]Go to that beam.
[217:59.71]Go to that beam.
[218:09.26]What is it?
[218:35.47]That could be rare.
[218:38.79]I'll go get it.
[218:49.13]I thought that was a marker that I put down.
[218:51.13]I thought that was one of those beacon things.
[218:54.37]When I looked on the map, I was like, wait a minute, I didn't put that down.
[219:03.38]I have a gold one on the map.
[219:06.31]This ends at 5 a.m., dude.
[219:07.87]Hurry up.
[219:10.12]What?
[219:21.81]Lighting is... Ooh, there's, um... What is it?
[219:25.11]Unobtainium, whatever it is.
[219:47.74]Frank?
[219:49.46]It's not like the, uh... What's the other force from the other games?
[219:54.87]You have to be within the same zone or something?
[220:14.75]I think Frank is dead.
[220:18.24]Really?
[220:18.60]That would be kind of sad.
[220:20.47]Alright, so what is this?
[221:10.07]Is it... Does it work?
[221:21.03]Star fragment.
[221:23.03]Mysterious stone fragment that fell from the sky.
[221:24.90]Looks like it would fetch a good price, but you may be able to use it in a certain recipe.
[221:30.30]Alright, nice.
[221:33.78]So now, what do I want to go from here?
[221:35.40]Probably fast travel back to here?
[221:38.18]Oh, I need the shrooms, right.
[221:41.08]I wiped this out.
[221:44.86]I need to go back to the village and I have to talk to... Yeah, hold on.
[221:53.01]Cook it?
[221:57.07]What if you cook the star?
[222:01.64]Do you make a black hole in Hyrule Kingdom and never get sucked into it?
[222:17.65]Okay, I need to find a couple more shrooms.
[222:20.09]Apparently a few nearby.
[222:21.11]They're probably down here.
[222:26.43]Really?
[222:38.10]Okay.
[222:50.55]Where are these mushrooms?
[222:58.17]What do you mean nearby?
[222:59.35]They're not nearby.
[223:00.23]Okay.
[223:37.56]What the fuck are these things?
[224:00.70]Oh!
[224:01.08]Here they are.
[224:02.72]Alright, I got three, right?
[224:05.57]That's what you needed?
[224:09.30]I got a lizard.
[224:19.41]Iron shroom.
[224:25.33]Get a bunch of these too.
[224:42.97]OK.
[224:44.55]I got a lot of these.
[224:45.33]I thought this was live.
[224:55.46]How much is enough?
[224:57.68]Of any given material, like 10, 20?
[225:03.79]Finding new objective.
[225:13.44]It's never enough.
[225:14.56]25.
[225:14.76]I think that's good enough.
[225:22.48]Cool.
[225:24.46]Let's turn this in.
[225:27.71]Can you just watch funny videos instead of playing this?
[225:48.26]Dude, can I just like watch some funny videos?
[226:11.24]Ooh.
[226:13.24]That was worth it.
[226:13.76]Hmm.
[226:21.66]Link, I've got some news that should be music to your ears.
[226:24.00]I found a way to help you search for new objects using the Sheikah Sensor Plus.
[226:29.92]Uh, show your excitement.
[226:30.86]Okay, I was doing some research.
[226:33.63]I found out there were some pictures of the past left on the Guidance Stone.
[226:37.89]If you add those pictures to the compendium, you can search... We already went over this.
[226:46.31]Didn't we already go over this?
[227:02.45]Drop one of those and take a photo.
[227:03.85]That's a great idea.
[227:04.65]What am I doing?
[227:31.10]Doesn't Truman know that he has to eat a bug since he made 10 Dark Souls references?
[227:39.57]That was never set in stone.
[227:42.41]I have to eat a bug.
[227:43.51]What bug?
[227:46.47]I didn't make 10 Dark Souls references.
[227:57.08]You name me 10 Dark Souls references and I'll believe you.
[228:01.98]OK.
[228:02.28]Please be a centipede.
[228:07.64]God damn it.
[228:09.36]No.
[228:10.56]Enough.
[228:11.76]Enough.
[228:16.51]Is this the sus guy?
[228:23.71]Yeah.
[228:30.25]Yeah.
[228:41.93]I should probably not have these mushrooms anymore, right?
[228:55.16]Although... Okay, let me do this.
[228:59.78]Where's the truffle?
[229:02.24]Watch this.
[229:02.61]Somebody said you could do this.
[229:06.07]Truffle.
[229:09.53]now I can find truffles which that's pretty cool that's a good idea alright well I definitely don't want it to be that so uh let's do it how about I change it back to shrines
[229:41.01]Need to... on the map.
[229:42.85]Okay.
[229:45.51]Alright, there we go.
[230:00.84]Okay.
[230:02.56]Cool.
[230:04.17]I gotta talk to the lady at the town, right?
[230:16.60]You look like a truffle.
[230:31.95]Sorry, I wasn't looking.
[230:39.48]I came back.
[230:40.70]I'm ready for my reward.
[230:41.76]Your Eternal Reward.
[230:47.54]Alright, uh, are you the one who took care of those monsters?
[230:49.90]It's me.
[230:53.39]Maybe he did it.
[230:56.39]Not much of a reward, but hey, it's light.
[230:58.45]That counts.
[231:00.50]Oh, fresh milk.
[231:06.60]Ten milk.
[231:18.15]I feel like that's a pretty good reward.
[231:19.89]Alright.
[231:25.99]What else do I got?
[231:26.81]Alright.
[231:29.43]I'm going to go up this way.
[231:34.33]Maybe I should go to Kakariko Village?
[231:43.13]Kakariko Village.
[231:44.91]Get a horse and go up.
[231:50.73]That's what I'm going to do.
[231:56.00]Do we play Elden Ring?
[231:58.26]You're like a four month sub.
[231:59.82]I think you would definitely know that already.
[232:05.91]Frank is on the map.
[232:21.77]Oh wait, no, Elden Ring came out in February.
[232:25.07]Wow, why does it feel like it came out like three months ago?
[232:28.33]February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September.
[232:32.19]That's seven months.
[232:33.80]I'm corrected, I'm sorry.
[232:35.84]I don't know, let me pull that back.
[232:37.96]Wait, Frank is on the map.
[232:40.08]Wait, Frank is here.
[232:43.22]What?
[232:46.66]Hold on.
[232:53.17]That was wicked rude.
[232:53.99]Yeah, that was pretty rude.
[232:56.89]Yeah, I'm just like, oh, you should know.
[233:00.79]You should know that I streamed that.
[233:02.75]That was dumb.
[233:06.68]If you were a four-month sub and maybe you have only been here for five or six months, maybe you don't even know I played Elden Ring.
[233:14.48]One of my favorite games ever made.
[233:20.27]Except for Rodan.
[233:21.15]Except for the worst spider ever in the whole series.
[233:24.29]Alright, where are you?
[233:26.93]Why was Frank not hearing me?
[233:42.23]By the way, I played pre-patch.
[233:45.13]Pre-patch Rodan.
[233:46.79]Don't ever forget that.
[233:50.11]Is Frank just free?
[233:51.83]Like, I was just free.
[234:17.67]Don't replace Frank.
[234:19.30]We need to find Frank.
[234:21.30]Frank.
[234:59.38]Why's Frank over here?
[235:00.22]No, no, don't go, don't go.
[235:08.59]Alright, where's the stable?
[235:13.99]Frank, I'm sorry.
[235:14.91]I'm just gonna...
[235:26.88]This horse is better.
[235:27.90]It has three, um, gals.
[235:34.02]I'm keeping this one for now.
[235:35.30]Where's the stable?
[235:40.93]I wanted to go up.
[235:43.27]Where's the stable?
[235:53.21]Frank will just still be here?
[235:54.37]Okay.
[235:56.33]Isn't it right next to me somewhere?
[235:57.54]Oh, there it is.
[236:14.29]Yeah, this horse has three yas.
[236:38.38]Um, go this way then.
[236:39.38]What are you doing?
[236:45.92]The horses control so strangely.
[236:47.68]Wait.
[236:59.59]You're smart.
[237:00.39]You're very smart.
[237:06.58]Don't run too far.
[237:07.56]Ooh, that thing's a piece of shit.
[237:10.24]Never mind.
[237:10.70]Better than this.
[237:37.16]Take a picture of the chest.
[237:43.73]Oh, that's cool.
[237:50.47]I feel you.
[237:50.91]Cool.
[237:54.54]Alright.
[237:55.44]Let me go back to the stable.
[237:56.30]Wait.
[237:57.98]Are there like ancient screws and shit?
[237:59.32]Yeah, there is.
[238:05.25]We're going to go.
[238:06.55]We're going to leave now.
[238:10.41]Alright, we're safe.
[238:13.78]This game is beautiful, isn't it?
[238:15.80]It is.
[238:16.36]Yeah, it looks great.
[238:39.24]Okay, I want this horse.
[238:42.11]This horse is stronger.
[238:43.11]It's a little bigger.
[238:47.79]Yep.
[238:52.04]Ooh, look at that.
[238:52.62]Three, two, and two.
[238:55.66]Much better.
[238:56.68]Whoa.
[239:16.22]Let's go.
[239:28.70]So now I'm ready.
[239:34.20]I'm going to teleport to here.
[239:37.52]The horse comes with me, right?
[239:41.57]No, I want to take the horse too.
[240:04.22]Yeah, I got to talk to Impa.
[240:07.84]OK, Impa would have the answer, right?
[240:15.58]Alright.
[240:15.78]Let's go talk to Impa.
[240:17.56]Where's Frank?
[240:21.39]Frank 2 does not hear me, so I can't have a horse.
[240:23.65]I can't fast travel and then have a horse.
[240:36.07]That's going in the review, by the way.
[240:52.32]We need to run around, but you seem just fine.
[240:56.46]Locked mementos complete.
[240:59.05]Now then, let me see.
[241:06.84]Yeah, this is the camera that Zelda used 100 years ago.
[241:16.31]Could be that if you visit locations within those pictures, you'll be able to restore some of your lost memories.
[241:20.64]So it's like the Elden Ring paintings.
[241:27.50]Cool.
[241:28.42]Okay.
[241:31.24]Have I been to one of them?
[241:37.23]Be properly equipped.
[241:40.94]I won't fail.
[241:41.48]That was the 10th reference.
[241:56.85]That was an Elden Ring reference.
[241:58.17]That was not Dark Souls reference.
[242:02.48]Kid.
[242:07.16]What do you got?
[242:23.15]It's the same thing.
[242:24.21]Okay, so you found the very fountain.
[242:34.47]Oh, wait.
[242:42.59]I know what that is.
[242:47.86]Oh, let's go.
[242:51.71]Let's do it.
[242:51.97]Did I just fuck up the quest because I'm...
[243:13.55]New clothes!
[243:14.63]Cute outfits!
[243:16.39]Cute outfits!
[243:26.82]You have a Sheikah Slate on your hip.
[243:30.74]Wait.
[243:32.29]A Sheikah Slate?
[243:34.21]Isn't that, like, an incredible thing that only incredible people can have?
[243:47.33]Hold on, just looking for a cute outfit.
[243:48.91]I don't want it.
[243:58.93]I have climbing gear.
[244:04.44]Oh shit, I'm losing him.
[244:15.96]Mask is OP.
[244:20.68]Oh, maybe I'll get it later.
[244:23.22]Not going anywhere.
[244:33.51]This rain juice is pretty good.
[244:41.91]Hmm.
[244:45.35]Hmm.
[244:47.36]Yeah, I know where it is.
[244:49.38]Okay, yeah, I know where it is.
[244:59.35]It's where the big lady is, right?
[245:21.83]That's a good pick too.
[245:27.36]Isn't there something she can do?
[245:33.78]Enhance your clothing.
[245:34.94]Oh.
[245:35.00]Take a look.
[245:42.40]Wait a minute.
[245:46.07]Climber's bandana and some rush rooms make this better.
[245:54.20]Choo-choo jelly, soldier's armor.
[245:56.62]Okay.
[245:57.96]Alright, I need rush rooms and I can upgrade my climbing gear.
[246:05.38]Cool.
[246:05.96]I need a picture of a rush room.
[246:06.88]Do I have rush rooms?
[246:12.97]I think I have a picture.
[246:14.45]Well, not a picture.
[246:14.95]I think I have one in my inventory.
[246:17.63]Don't I?
[246:17.93]Do I have a single rush room?
[246:28.22]I don't think so.
[246:37.92]Where do you get mushrooms?
[246:40.36]I cooked them all.
[246:41.10]Yeah, but they're on the sides of cliffs, aren't they?
[246:44.59]Usually they stick it out of a cliff.
[246:45.61]I can find one right here.
[246:50.89]It's the purple ones on the cliffs.
[246:57.34]I'll check that after this guy.
[246:58.44]Maybe this guy will give me some, uh, rush run.
[247:10.28]Here's the picture.
[247:18.09]That's it.
[247:19.15]It's beautiful, but I thought it would be more sacred and elegant.
[247:23.73]How is that not elegant and sacred?
[247:34.84]Is there a place you've been seeking?
[247:41.31]Oh, I know where that is.
[247:42.69]Alright.
[247:44.41]Big mountain east of this... Wait.
[247:47.97]I know that place.
[247:48.65]There's a big mountain east of this village.
[247:51.47]It's called Mount Leneiru.
[247:54.97]At the base of Mount Leneiru, on the west side of Nedra Snowfield, lies that gate.
[248:01.50]Base of Mount Leneiru, west side of Nedra.
[248:06.78]I'm going to mark it.
[248:19.22]West of the nature snow field.
[248:23.36]So, like here.
[248:24.34]I'm going to put a pin here.
[248:30.89]And it's going to be a... Go check this shit out.
[248:41.07]It's up from there?
[248:42.31]I'll figure it out.
[248:42.79]Alright, I need to find some rush rooms.
[248:47.27]Let's check the clips.
[248:54.82]Because if I'm right here, I might as well try to upgrade this.
[249:05.51]No rush rooms?
[249:10.37]I don't see any.
[249:11.69]Oops.
[249:18.74]I distinctly remember there was a ton somewhere else.
[249:22.04]I remember just passing by them and not picking them up.
[249:23.62]I was like, nah, I don't need them.
[249:29.45]Put them on your sensor?
[249:30.29]I don't have a picture of them.
[249:33.89]Oh, I'm doing that.
[249:46.48]Look at this.
[249:47.96]A great find.
[249:48.56]Look at all that money.
[249:53.50]Cool.
[249:57.37]Alright.
[249:59.09]Here we go.
[250:03.45]Shrine.
[250:04.37]Shrine.
[250:05.51]And then I'm gonna open that thingy.
[250:08.55]What's wrong?
[250:16.89]Hold on.
[250:18.15]There's a little thing here.
[250:22.49]Wooden bow.
[250:25.57]Rusty claymore.
[250:29.63]Sucks.
[250:32.35]Super fairy!
[250:33.71]Oh, I got it.
[250:46.78]Soldier's broadsword.
[250:47.92]I feel like I have some crap to get rid of.
[250:52.18]Yeah, I do.
[251:06.07]This thing is better.
[251:06.87]Torches are easy to find.
[251:17.48]Yeah, they are, but I feel like I need one and I don't have one sometimes.
[251:21.08]Nothing back there?
[251:40.29]Okay.
[251:41.19]Is this swamp or can I stand in this?
[251:52.71]Where am I even going?
[251:53.49]Alright, so I do want to go this way.
[251:55.45]This is kind of the direction I want to be going.
[251:56.99]What the fuck?
[252:10.50]That was terrifying.
[252:28.41]Alright, shrine time.
[252:34.63]I love the shrines.
[252:35.25]They're so much fun.
[252:48.82]Shrine time.
[252:52.76]Shrine time!
[252:56.97]Why do we do that?
[252:58.64]Has anybody figured that out?
[253:00.10]Is there a reason why anytime you stretch or if you're lying in bed or if you're just you have to make this horrible noise?
[253:08.76]Why?
[253:11.05]When I get up in the morning, it doesn't happen every time either.
[253:12.93]It's just like.
[253:13.43]I don't I don't know why.
[253:20.35]It's never been explained.
[253:25.68]And you freeze, your whole body locks up!
[253:29.63]Why do we lock up and scream?
[253:32.95]I'm not the only person that does this, right?
[253:34.43]Yeah, when you guys get up in the morning, do you lock up and scream?
[253:50.24]Yes, yeah, everybody does, right?
[253:57.52]That's emote only, you can't tell me.
[254:29.72]Shit.
[254:37.35]Alright, that's obviously not what you do.
[254:55.75]Climb.
[255:40.26]World's most simple task.
[255:50.38]Okay.
[255:51.50]Cool.
[255:51.96]Great.
[255:52.36]Now what?
[255:54.74]Alright.
[255:55.44]So I've got stasis.
[255:58.20]Okay.
[255:58.42]Check this out.
[255:58.84]I think I know what to do.
[256:08.77]Come on.
[257:09.66]What was that?
[258:36.45]That it?
[258:38.61]What do I have to do?
[258:53.80]Let's do more time.
[259:02.51]Oh fuck it dude, I got the bowl already.
[259:35.53]Um, wait.
[260:04.06]OK, so I gotta put the button down.
[260:05.88]Hold on.
[260:06.72]OK.
[260:53.85]That's what you do.
[260:54.45]You just gotta scoop it up like a reverse claw machine.
[260:56.37]I know what I'm doing.
[260:59.74]Ugh.
[261:35.02]What do you mean no?
[261:36.00]That's exactly what you're supposed to do.
[261:37.10]I'm just too slow.
[261:42.10]Watch this.
[261:42.60]Ready?
[261:45.18]I didn't... I wanted to... I'll get it right here.
[262:06.00]That's definitely what you do.
[262:07.05]That's definitely, it's just this stupid thing.
[262:11.59]I need to get this in the right spot.
[262:13.19]Hold on.
[262:20.65]Check this out.
[262:21.21]I got it.
[262:21.61]Ready?
[262:27.51]So if I come straight up from here, I want to get the ball.
[263:22.28]I had it.
[263:22.80]I just did it.
[263:23.80]I just did it.
[263:24.87]I just did it, but this thing was too fucking wiggly.
[263:31.95]I just did it.
[263:32.69]I just did it, guys.
[263:34.29]I just did it.
[263:35.09]I'm doing it that way.
[263:35.85]I don't... I just did it.
[263:37.97]I fucking win.
[264:17.36]That's it.
[264:17.78]I got it.
[264:18.20]I win.
[264:18.80]Did you lose your points?
[264:26.89]I did it.
[264:36.49]You could have just left a ball on top.
[264:46.41]Right.
[264:52.00]Thank God that's over.
[264:53.22]Let's make me sneeze.
[265:13.90]That wasn't even that bad.
[265:14.78]It wasn't even that bad.
[265:16.02]There's another one right over here.
[265:32.35]I do have four orbs.
[265:34.85]I think I need to do health.
[265:36.71]I'm getting one hit killed way too often.
[265:39.03]Way too often.
[265:44.05]Oh, I got a burp.
[266:06.25]Where was that other shrine?
[266:08.13]There it is.
[266:14.79]Get out of there.
[266:16.90]I'm doing the shrine.
[266:19.18]Here's my plan.
[266:19.74]I'm doing the shrine here.
[266:21.42]And then I'm going to wrap around here to do the divine beast.
[266:25.32]That's my plan.
[266:25.99]What are you turning the spirit orbs again?
[266:28.69]I forget.
[266:30.37]Who does that?
[266:40.26]Make sure you get this tower too.
[266:42.26]Yeah, I'm going to get that tower.
[266:45.30]And... Alright.
[266:49.12]The route I'm going to go... Straight that way.
[266:52.11]Get the tower.
[266:53.29]Get the shrine.
[266:55.31]And then I'm going to bang a right that way.
[266:58.93]Get this tower.
[267:01.05]And get that tower.
[267:12.64]How do I take out the binoculars to mark again?
[267:14.60]I can do it with the camera, right?
[267:17.13]How do I do this?
[267:23.95]It's L3.
[267:28.82]Bright stick.
[267:29.28]Okay, yeah, thank you.
[267:44.29]OK.
[267:44.43]Alright, cool.
[267:47.67]Let's go.
[267:59.15]The statue in Kakariko, OK.
[268:09.52]How long are you going to be live for?
[268:11.38]Um, I don't know.
[268:14.28]I don't really have a set plan.
[268:15.20]Another hour or two?
[268:25.19]Where's your horse?
[268:25.89]I know, I just don't have one.
[268:30.89]Did I just call a bunch of bulls?
[268:34.04]Why did the horse call?
[268:35.00]Do that.
[268:37.84]Why did I just call that?
[268:40.26]Why are they all freaking out?
[268:47.26]That was weird.
[268:50.20]Smoke here?
[268:50.74]What's this?
[268:51.08]It's a new ingredient.
[269:20.24]I'm so dumb.
[269:36.15]Oh, what's this?
[269:38.99]Armorant.
[270:01.06]Is there a chest here?
[270:05.03]Usually there is, right?
[270:07.33]Oh, nice arrows.
[270:33.70]Kind of running out of weapons.
[270:35.40]Oh, the cleave!
[270:41.74]That was perfect.
[270:42.62]Okay.
[271:05.47]That was challenging.
[271:06.17]Something good.
[271:08.91]Knight's Halberd.
[271:12.65]I'll take it.
[271:17.25]Spiked Boko Spear.
[271:19.55]And... Nah.
[271:26.43]Alright, onto the shrine.
[271:34.54]Zap Shroom?
[271:40.71]Make sure to take a picture of the weapons.
[271:45.22]Take photos.
[271:48.00]Oh, you there.
[271:52.52]Over here, over here.
[272:03.31]Oh, Jace, we're calling on you so suddenly.
[272:06.03]I am Lido, a proud member of the Distinguished Zora.
[272:09.86]Are you a real Hylian?
[272:11.63]I had no choice but to call upon you.
[272:13.89]Will you spare me a moment of your time?
[272:15.41]Sure.
[272:17.25]Okay.
[272:22.89]See that tower, the one atop that mountain?
[272:26.15]Yeah.
[272:27.35]I need you to go upstream of Zora River, which runs along the north side of that tower, to Inogo Bridge.
[272:37.12]I can see it in your eyes.
[272:37.92]You're asking yourself why.
[272:40.34]Reasonable question for a stranger costed by a passing Zora in such a manner.
[272:44.78]But I must assure you, this venture will be profitable for you as well.
[272:48.79]See, Prince Sedan of the Zora is in desperate search of a strong Hylian.
[272:53.73]And as a loyal request from the prince himself, it's safe to assume a generous reward is in the cards.
[272:59.95]I'm asking you to go meet Prince Sedan at an Ogo bridge along the Zora river just upstream from here.
[273:09.34]You're getting robbed.
[273:12.09]Okay.
[273:13.03]That's fine.
[273:18.17]Wait, do I have to accept it?
[273:24.05]Or just know that it's there?
[273:26.30]Zidon.
[273:42.73]Uh, this is not good.
[273:45.94]Three nuts.
[274:13.02]um do I have to land in here or maybe what do I have to burn it or something fire right yeah I remember seeing that spoiler from last time I was live that sucks I'm sorry man
[274:46.32]Okay.
[274:47.84]So I need fire.
[274:49.26]There's fire over there.
[274:51.06]The question is, can I bring it this way?
[274:56.54]Is this thing a giant torch?
[275:02.20]This thing right here?
[275:04.47]Oh, I have Flint.
[275:08.43]Dude, I can stand in this.
[275:09.97]Why do you drown in that?
[275:11.23]I can stand up.
[275:45.34]Hello?
[275:53.82]This doesn't work.
[276:08.97]What about my arrow?
[276:09.85]Wait, hold on.
[276:10.39]Yeah.
[276:19.50]That doesn't start a fire?
[276:20.64]Hold on, I'll be right back.
[276:34.47]Does this work?
[276:57.48]We need wood and Flint.
[277:17.97]What the fuck?
[277:20.45]Wood and Flint?
[277:22.37]I almost got no more left!
[277:32.92]Okay.
[277:50.11]Bro, your dark ooga is showing.
[277:54.31]Dark ooga.
[278:03.85]There's a bug in my hair.
[278:18.30]Oh boy, they're done.
[278:28.97]Are they done?
[278:29.47]They can burn?
[278:34.49]Whatever.
[278:42.62]This is worse than a regular apple.
[278:45.20]Regular apple is better.
[278:45.96]No, it's not.
[279:00.13]It's not?
[279:00.81]I thought it was one heart.
[279:07.85]No, that's not what I said.
[279:08.59]I mean, I like regular apples in real life.
[279:11.53]I don't like baked apples.
[279:13.29]I like cold apples.
[279:15.39]You guys misunderstood me.
[279:26.60]I want more weapons and armor and stuff.
[279:31.64]Ahem.
[279:41.14]Let's trial.
[279:47.64]Speed of Light.
[280:11.31]I got it.
[280:19.88]OK.
[280:23.20]Now.
[280:25.52]It's on the other side.
[280:40.04]Mm-hmm.
[280:41.44]Right.
[280:41.74]Oh, that shit floods.
[281:38.72]Hmm.
[281:41.32]Hmm.
[281:43.66]Hmm.
[281:46.22]It seems I don't know where to go.
[281:48.01]Hmm.
[281:50.91]This elevator goes up.
[281:54.37]But this barrel goes down.
[281:57.11]Hmm.
[282:01.81]Alright, um...
[282:06.24]It's definitely something out here.
[282:07.14]What if I block this?
[282:13.41]Does it do anything?
[283:29.08]What's the point of this?
[283:33.36]Oh, thank God.
[283:41.31]Ice cold.
[283:53.04]You have to like fill the barrel with water.
[283:56.88]So it makes sense, right?
[284:02.81]Make it heavier?
[284:03.35]It's not what you do.
[284:25.90]I probably have to spin this thing back.
[284:29.44]But...
[284:32.03]Can I?
[284:43.96]Interesting.
[284:44.48]Why would I want to do that, though?
[284:48.12]Why would I want to stop that?
[284:57.51]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[285:02.50]I don't know.
[285:04.01]But let me go over here.
[285:07.15]Okay, if I go like this...
[285:35.13]Oh water.
[285:38.94]Water.
[285:43.22]Uh-huh.
[286:01.17]But OK, so fill the tank with water.
[286:09.67]Don't you know?
[286:11.95]Fill the thing with water.
[286:20.38]OK.
[286:21.98]Now.
[286:22.38]Uh.
[286:30.04]Okay.
[286:51.98]So I have to get this.
[286:57.09]plan is to get this back over there and then get over there myself freeze time on that thing alright I know what to do this could be wrong but whatever let's try it get this back over there okay now I'm gonna do this
[287:25.34]What if I do that?
[287:26.00]Maybe that's stupid.
[287:28.30]This could be stupid, but we'll find out.
[287:34.93]I can't freeze time on this, so alright, I'm going to freeze time on you.
[287:41.24]Spin it.
[287:42.78]Go.
[287:54.90]Alright.
[288:04.58]Got it.
[288:09.75]Wasn't that bad.
[288:14.95]Is this for a spirit orb?
[288:22.80]Very cool.
[288:35.24]Spirit Orb.
[288:39.96]Five?
[288:40.26]Yep.
[288:41.16]Cool.
[288:41.34]Alright, now I'm going to activate the tower.
[288:45.14]And... Oh, I have the seeds too, don't I?
[288:50.74]I got four of those.
[289:01.23]The time freeze didn't do anything.
[289:05.05]You didn't even notice the extra chest.
[289:10.29]Yeah, whatever.
[289:19.02]There is some unobtainium over here though.
[289:30.80]Link, you are an awful swimmer.
[289:32.02]Give me a break.
[289:32.78]Really?
[289:33.36]I'm going to drown in here.
[289:38.06]No, I'm not.
[289:45.29]Where is it?
[289:50.03]What a waste.
[289:58.04]That's such a waste.
[290:00.54]Nah, I'll just die.
[290:01.56]Whatever.
[290:01.88]Just die.
[290:03.20]Go ahead and die.
[290:04.00]Come on.
[290:04.94]Yep.
[290:35.82]I'm just gonna jump from off the shrine.
[290:37.46]Go from up here.
[290:47.23]Oh, right.
[290:47.63]Ice functions.
[290:48.63]You're right.
[290:49.09]I forgot I had ice.
[290:50.56]I keep forgetting you can use this stuff outside of the shrines.
[290:54.06]In my brain, it's a shrine power.
[291:07.32]Okay.
[291:14.61]Get the unobtainium and then head over here.
[291:23.91]Secured the shit out of me.
[291:49.91]Cool, let's go.
[291:59.11]Sludge Hammer is damaged.
[292:01.21]Where did you get?
[292:01.73]I have not found another Sludge Hammer.
[292:07.13]Alright, it's broken, but how do you get another sledgehammer?
[292:16.03]Oh.
[292:18.61]I could have taken a picture of it.
[292:23.93]Post the lead pic.
[292:27.50]There's a bunch about.
[292:28.46]Alright.
[292:32.00]Stay true to this mission here.
[292:37.50]That's what I'm going after.
[292:38.34]Why is it getting so dark?
[293:00.09]Step right up and buy him.
[293:02.75]My fine bananas.
[293:03.85]They're available.
[293:04.49]They're so yellow, they make you yell.
[293:06.47]Oh!
[293:06.61]Okay.
[293:08.71]I'll buy some.
[293:09.23]Sure.
[293:18.04]That's a hundred dollars.
[293:19.40]I will take your life.
[293:31.42]Don't you just love when the fucking lock-on turns around and looks at the shrine behind you?
[293:59.62]Got something to say?
[294:02.80]Mighty bananas.
[294:04.72]Vicious sickle and... Ooh, $15.
[294:14.49]Never mind.
[294:14.93]I like the halberds.
[294:23.31]The reach is awesome.
[294:27.80]Brine?
[294:48.86]It was 99 bananas?
[294:52.53]I think it was just a mighty banana.
[294:53.91]Uh, one.
[294:56.67]I don't think it was more than one.
[295:06.66]Alright, vantage point.
[295:09.06]Interesting camp that I don't want to go into.
[295:15.22]Ooh.
[295:16.64]I keep seeing these around, but... Did I do this right?
[295:46.74]Get out of the way.
[295:48.20]Oh, cool.
[296:22.88]Where was that shrine?
[296:23.62]I almost didn't make it.
[296:36.15]I don't see the shrine that was blinking.
[296:37.59]I said it was right over here.
[296:44.85]Only this side of the mountain?
[296:47.49]Let's find out.
[296:58.61]Another mountain peak.
[297:00.07]Yeah, okay, here it is.
[297:02.41]I'm not- I don't want to kill the fox.
[297:06.58]What about shield surfing?
[297:07.60]How do you do it?
[297:12.95]You parry?
[297:27.41]There it is.
[297:32.78]Oh, rush rooms!
[297:56.21]Take a picture!
[298:03.81]Got it.
[298:07.49]I already have a picture.
[298:08.31]That one's better.
[298:08.95]Alright, that was down here, right?
[298:26.99]Okay, I didn't know that you could get that hurt doing that.
[298:29.44]I guess that was pretty brutal.
[298:34.42]I thought I was safe, I guess.
[298:37.06]But no, I was not.
[298:45.32]Wait, who are you?
[298:48.46]Big hearty radish.
[298:49.92]Greatest vegetable on Earth.
[298:53.80]Oh, how wonderful.
[298:54.84]You are a Hylian.
[298:55.74]Yes.
[298:57.46]Oh, it's my lucky day.
[298:59.40]Oh, I apologize for calling you out so suddenly.
[299:01.62]I am Torfu of Zora.
[299:03.96]I've been searching for a Hylian like you for a very long time.
[299:07.26]My home, Zora's domain, is in terrible danger.
[299:09.72]That's why Prince... How do you say it?
[299:13.10]Zidon?
[299:14.20]Prince Zidon sent me in search of a strong Hylian warrior.
[299:19.64]Prince Zidon is waiting at that bridge over there.
[299:23.14]Would you please talk to the prince and perhaps save us all?
[299:31.66]Zidon?
[299:33.78]Sidon.
[299:35.92]Sidon.
[299:36.68]Sidon.
[299:38.02]I don't know how to say it, man.
[299:39.52]I don't play Zelda.
[299:41.70]How do you say it?
[299:42.52]Is it Sidon?
[299:44.44]Sidon?
[299:47.81]Like Poseidon.
[299:49.27]Like Poseidon.
[299:49.95]Poseidon.
[299:52.05]Poseidon.
[299:58.71]Haven't I been saying that?
[300:15.91]Combat trial, though.
[300:21.65]Alright, I'm taking some food here.
[300:27.86]This is defense.
[300:28.74]This is attack boost.
[300:30.50]I'm going with this.
[300:31.02]Let's go.
[300:44.77]Computer, play Salaryman.
[301:00.90]That attack up is fucking incredible.
[301:12.55]I'm making so many more of those.
[301:22.06]What did I miss?
[301:22.58]What did I miss?
[301:24.74]Why did it miss?
[301:26.30]It shouldn't have missed.
[301:28.08]It shouldn't have missed.
[301:52.39]Computer, can I see a nude taint, please?
[301:56.09]That is not safe for work.
[301:59.39]Your wife is calling.
[302:00.79]She says it's an emergency.
[302:16.84]I'm doing the dodge and it's not happening.
[302:19.08]Give me the attack food.
[302:26.89]Where is it?
[302:32.01]This one.
[303:14.98]Ooh, we don't know what that is.
[303:28.20]A guardian shield.
[303:36.15]I know what that is.
[303:37.23]Guardian sword.
[303:38.15]Oh, yep.
[303:40.73]Tons of, uh, blankets.
[303:42.41]Nice.
[303:45.04]Didn't I already have a Guardian Shield?
[303:47.36]I do, right?
[303:49.27]Oh, the Guardian Shield Plus.
[303:50.75]Okay.
[303:55.73]And a chest.
[304:03.05]That's really good.
[304:05.85]And an orb.
[304:07.95]I might be able to get two levels up soon.
[304:14.57]They're great for sliding.
[304:26.44]Warp count.
[304:32.36]Oh, it said six.
[304:33.70]Yeah, I'm blocking it.
[304:40.15]That one guy is wrong, don't do that, they break instantly.
[304:44.23]Ah, okay.
[304:51.36]Can you please do the get out of here, get out of here, come on, get out of here?

[305:20.76]Yeah, it's this.

[305:25.94]Get outta here!
[305:28.49]Get outta here!
[305:29.15]Get outta here!
[305:38.45]Yeah, it was that person's birthday, so.
[305:40.53]Happy birthday.
[305:44.59]What the fuck is that?
[305:45.39]That's Hoover the Talking Seal.
[305:51.85]Alright, I'm doing that.
[306:01.02]That's what that's from?
[306:02.58]Yes.
[306:05.92]Yeah, that's not me doing that.
[306:09.55]I mean, it's me doing an impression of that.
[306:14.09]Why did you have that ready?
[306:15.39]Uh, a mod posted in mod chat.
[306:20.37]They were prepared.
[306:21.03]Go meet, um, Scythe.
[306:33.29]Oh, I'm so bad at the game that I missed the opportunity to get Dark Souls'd.
[306:53.24]Get outta here, get outta here, get outta here, get outta here, get outta here, get outta here!
[306:57.64]What did I just shoot?
[307:03.31]Hey!
[307:03.79]Hey!
[307:05.53]Outta there!
[307:09.25]What a weird animal.
[307:23.84]It's fine.
[307:24.94]Fine.
[307:31.28]I'm just gonna be left with awesome equipment and then I'm gonna have to start going down the list.
[307:44.54]Oh, stop.
[307:45.83]Does it have to be raining permanently right now?
[307:47.51]I feel like it's been raining the whole time I've been streaming.
[307:55.84]You're weird if I call you weird.
[307:58.04]That means you're weird weird.
[308:20.79]Don't be stupid.
[308:22.67]Wait, hold on.
[308:57.01]You're gonna end up with 999 jellies.
[309:07.25]Why did I die?
[309:08.05]What, did I stub my toe on the ground?
[309:10.17]And what was that about?
[309:11.28]Whatever.
[309:17.60]Is it still raining?
[309:20.26]It's still raining!
[309:27.24]Oh my god.
[309:28.64]Even with the climbing outfit on.
[310:43.90]Oh, giant dinosaur bones.
[310:47.50]Did he just throw a rock at me?
[311:04.04]Who did that?
[311:17.01]Dick?
[311:19.35]You dick?
[311:20.13]Who is it?
[311:23.71]What the hell is that?
[311:34.24]Whoa!
[311:35.06]What did I just do?
[311:35.90]These are explosive arrows.
[311:38.24]Hold on, hold on.
[311:38.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[312:01.85]What was that thing?
[312:12.44]Ice rod.
[312:14.78]Waves of freezing air?
[312:16.14]Does it break?
[312:24.07]I don't want to put that on.
[312:26.95]Holy shit.
[312:27.53]Okay, this is awesome.
[312:35.36]Very cool.
[312:37.84]Alright.
[312:38.80]Come on to the tower.
[312:45.02]Chest or anything?
[312:48.42]Can I break these with the club or does it have to be a hammer?
[312:55.66]Damn it.
[312:59.12]Bombs will do it.
[312:59.66]Can bombs do it too?
[313:14.28]Cool.
[313:17.14]Some lucky person is going to find that and get rich and that's fine.
[313:19.60]I don't care.
[313:35.43]Interesting.
[313:49.59]Press for a moment.
[313:50.27]Have I given a rating?
[314:15.84]It's a...
[314:21.47]I don't know.
[314:27.04]It's definitely a... It's way higher than an 8.
[314:33.61]Because I'm realizing the amount of things you can actually do.
[314:38.91]It's very comfy.
[314:42.07]Okay.
[314:43.19]I know people are going to be mad that I'm going to say this.
[314:45.92]But...
[314:47.34]Alright, whatever I'm going to say.
[314:49.07]This is a comfy Elden Ring.
[314:54.11]It's not, I didn't say easier.
[314:55.41]It's not.
[314:57.61]Oh, this is like a kid's game.
[314:59.17]No, no, no.
[314:59.61]It's just a comfier Elden Ring.
[315:05.71]I don't, I mean, yeah, maybe I've been a little stressed during some of the encounters, but for the most part, I'm not, um, I'm not stressed the fuck out like I am everywhere in Elden Ring.
[315:23.01]When I die in this, I just kind of laugh it off and I just climb the mountain again.
[315:26.19]You don't really get penalized for losing.
[315:31.02]Like you do in the FromSoftware games, obviously.
[315:42.99]I'll ski off the mountain and fall down and die.
[315:45.17]Because it doesn't matter.
[315:47.31]I'm not going to lose 50,000 souls or something.
[315:50.83]Or forget how I not even get back to that area again.
[315:59.03]Elden Ring for non-clout chasers.
[316:04.76]What do you mean clout chasers?
[316:09.06]Why is the Elden Ring for clout chasers?
[316:18.40]Okay.
[316:32.46]I can't believe it.
[316:33.94]Excuse me, have you talked to, uh, Sidon yet?
[316:36.62]He's down there.
[316:43.50]Yep, I order Prince Sidon of Zora's Domain.
[316:45.94]I'm searching for a Hylian.
[316:47.84]Found you.
[316:48.58]Go to the bridge and... Okay, they're really pushing this into my face.
[316:54.19]They are shoving this down my throat right now.
[316:56.13]They're just like pushing... It's like they're just like... Go, go, go, go!
[317:01.25]There's a guy, Sidon.
[317:02.13]There he is.
[317:03.31]Go to Sidon.
[317:04.35]Go.
[317:04.85]He's up there.
[317:05.56]Oh, by the way, find him.
[317:13.80]You're having what?
[317:15.54]What?
[317:19.33]I said they're pushing it down.
[317:20.21]You're having it in my throat.
[317:22.63]That's a saying.
[317:26.40]That's a saying.
[317:44.87]Okay, I just typed... Don't Google that.
[317:48.61]Don't Google that.
[317:50.37]You could find yourself in a little bit of trouble.
[317:53.47]I just... Oh, that... Oh, God.
[318:00.08]I got a warning.
[318:00.84]It was like, are you sure?
[318:02.30]I'm like, what it means... Oh, fucking Jesus Christ.
[318:07.96]Oh, my God.
[318:20.56]The Legend of Zelda.
[318:24.06]Prince Sidon.
[318:26.80]What did I Google?
[318:28.60]Never mind.
[318:29.14]Just forget it.
[318:30.62]Forget everything.
[318:32.20]Forget everything.
[318:41.57]Push this guy off.
[318:42.51]You can't.
[318:43.03]There's no collision.
[318:52.66]I'm having a little bit of trouble.
[318:53.80]Is Prince Sidon down here?
[319:14.90]Found him.
[319:17.84]Say, hey there, young one.
[319:21.84]Up top, above you.
[319:31.65]What's up, side?
[319:34.65]He's Googling.
[319:36.11]I don't have to tell you what I typed in.
[319:39.55]People question marked my use of that phrase.
[319:44.65]And I was like, what are you talking about?
[319:45.87]So I typed it in.
[319:49.82]And I just, I was like, okay, wait.
[320:07.45]What?
[320:07.79]Why is it?
[320:08.35]Everybody wanted me to come see Sidon.
[320:15.30]I am Sidon, the Zora Prince.
[320:18.42]What is your name?
[320:24.54]People really like Sidon.
[320:27.02]Okay.
[320:32.58]Have we met this person?
[320:42.43]I mean, in the other Zelda games.
[320:46.87]Is Prince Sidon a character that's in the other games?
[320:51.08]Oh.
[320:58.05]That's me.
[320:58.27]Yes, exquisite.
[321:04.30]Okay, that explains it.
[321:27.13]Please promise you will help us.
[321:28.19]We need your strength, warrior.
[321:29.75]Won't you please come to Zora's domain?
[321:31.53]Sure.
[321:34.39]Let's do it.
[321:43.37]Now Zora's domain will be saved for certain.
[321:45.35]No time to waste.
[321:46.09]Hurry up and head over.
[321:50.14]Because of the rain, the cliffs are too wet to climb.
[321:52.08]I figured that out earlier.
[321:54.22]To reach the domain, you will need to go straight along this path.
[321:59.59]As a Hylian, I know you are unable to swim up the... As such, the path to the domain may be difficult.
[322:07.66]You likely have a tough fight in store.
[322:09.16]There are monsters up ahead that attack with electricity.
[322:16.08]Don't give up.
[322:16.58]I believe in you.
[322:17.28]Oh, that's right.
[322:20.76]I have something that I'd like to give you.
[322:23.06]Small trinket.
[322:26.38]Electro Elixir.
[322:29.18]Cool.
[322:30.24]Grants a mid-level resistance to electricity.
[322:35.02]Okay.
[322:44.22]Okay.
[322:57.76]Everybody loves this person.
[323:01.37]Everybody loves Sidon.
[323:04.89]But who's my favorite character?
[323:25.82]But I need to know who my favorite character is.
[323:28.62]Alright, so we're going to go to, we're going to do this, but not yet.
[323:31.44]What did I just, what the hell is this?
[323:37.78]Heroes path mode?
[323:39.34]Wait, is this showing, is this showing where I've been?
[323:42.08]Like these scribbles?
[323:48.54]What, what, what happened here?
[323:51.24]What happened here?
[324:06.12]I don't know what I did over here.
[324:07.77]Press A. What killed me?
[324:16.21]Uh-huh.
[324:34.18]Wasn't that the first area?
[324:40.86]I teleported to this.
[324:46.14]How many times did you guys die in this first, like, level one starter zone?
[325:02.25]What was going on here?
[325:11.12]This is not accurate.
[325:13.42]This is not accurate.
[325:15.88]What happened?
[325:19.53]What did I do?
[325:20.21]Was I fucking drunk?
[325:22.25]Was I high?
[325:27.36]What happened?
[325:28.02]Oh, that's the stone guy, right.
[325:44.55]How do you die in Kakariko Village?
[325:46.04]It's impossible.
[326:03.55]God damn it, man.
[326:06.38]Oh my god.
[326:50.91]okay so I teleported back to there back to the same spot why did I teleport back here
[327:21.01]What are you doing?
[327:27.16]I... Here we are.
[327:42.89]Why did I teleport three times to the same place?
[328:01.40]That's a cool, I like that feature a lot.
[328:03.04]That's so fun.
[328:05.14]Go fight that guy now.
[328:06.52]Oh my, should I go get revenge?
[328:11.13]I'm getting revenge.
[328:30.11]I got bomb arrows.
[328:31.07]This guy is in deep shit.
[328:47.57]I don't have any hammers.
[328:48.53]Do I actually need a hammer?
[329:00.82]Alright, where is this dude?
[329:06.48]I think right here, right?
[329:17.59]Where is he?
[329:24.71]Rhyne!
[329:26.71]Rhyne!
[329:29.47]Where is he?
[329:34.79]It was over here, right?
[329:52.99]Over here?
[330:10.66]If you beat the game in under 200 hours, we could watch the whole thing.
[330:13.83]Really?
[330:18.77]Will I beat this game in... The Loch Ness Monster!
[330:35.44]What the hell is that thing?
[330:54.53]Am I gonna have an idea?
[330:55.17]Why are these not exploding?
[331:05.18]It's a bomb arrow!
[331:11.33]What?
[331:12.11]Because it's raining?
[331:24.97]I'm kind of more curious about that huge dragon eel serpent thing that was just flying around over here.
[331:50.62]Where'd it go?
[331:51.08]Whoa, what is that?
[331:58.19]Holy shit.
[331:59.35]Okay.
[332:00.72]I'm going to get a good pick of this.
[332:35.12]Focus it.
[332:39.87]Oh, look, he's like landing into my hand.
[333:09.90]I probably shouldn't fight this.
[333:29.07]You're right there.
[333:34.70]No, no, stay on task.
[333:36.22]Task, task, stay on task.
[333:44.15]Stay on task.
[333:51.70]I'm going to go over there and the thing's going to kill me.
[334:00.91]It's going to breathe fire, it's going to kill me, and I'm going to die in one hit.
[334:03.99]I need to fight that thing when I have 20 hearts, not 4.
[334:17.78]Okay.
[334:19.14]So where... Over here by the... Okay, Scout's Hill.
[334:26.32]I'm going to go there, and I'm going to find the rock person and attack him.

[347:33.06]What was that?
[347:33.52]Do I get out of here?
[347:36.71]What does that mean?
[347:41.37]Ah!
[347:46.85]Don't get on higher ground.
[347:48.43]What am I thinking?
[347:49.14]Duck!
[347:49.36]Duck!

[348:19.17]Okay.
[348:20.31]I get it.
[348:23.00]I feel accomplished.
[348:26.23]Maybe not the smartest way.
[348:28.13]The G4 raided the stream.
[348:31.29]Did I miss that?
[348:34.43]You hear from G4?
[348:34.96]What's going on?
[348:37.66]I didn't even see it.
[349:04.53]Um, but wait, don't I have the... What did I get, a topaz?
[349:30.24]So I killed the boss.
[349:32.17]It took me like 10 straight minutes to do that.
[349:35.42]And after the boss dies, I pick up all the items and then get struck by lightning because I'm the Tin Man.
[349:42.17]I have a bunch of pots and pans on me and I die instantly and then it didn't save.
[349:46.53]I have to do it again.
[349:51.09]You got killed by an act of God.
[349:58.94]Dude, I have to do that again?
[350:00.24]Um...
[350:06.17]Okay, well... I'm... I'm not... I'm not doing that again.
[350:13.75]Chatter's upset about the vet?
[350:18.35]Do I have the topaz?
[350:19.48]I don't see it anywhere.
[350:20.92]No?
[350:25.96]Times one?
[350:29.76]No.
[350:32.82]Sapphire?
[350:35.89]No, it didn't save.
[350:42.10]Well, shit.
[350:43.16]Okay, well I beat it and I know it's there.
[350:45.16]But I'm going to mark it.
[350:46.98]Right here.
[350:47.28]Because I'll come back and do it again.
[350:54.69]I'll just come back and kill it at like level 50.
[350:56.03]Okay, well now...
[351:08.97]I need to change this stamp.
[351:11.30]To... What is NPC again?
[351:14.48]Leaf?
[351:15.32]I don't remember.
[351:20.85]Spend the orbs.
[351:21.77]You need more hearts.
[351:22.87]Yeah, alright.
[351:23.93]Let me go to... Let me do two more shrines so I can do a double turn in.
[351:29.98]That's what I'm doing.
[351:48.97]in here.
[351:51.95]Anything fucked up?
[351:53.77]Anything fucked up in here?
[351:54.65]I don't see anything here.
[352:04.00]I'm just going this way.
[352:49.50]Alright, I'm biting my lip and I don't want you to see.
[353:10.31]It's so bad right now.
[353:11.19]Alright, I have to stop.
[353:16.78]Stop!
[353:25.92]Stop!
[353:28.72]Okay.
[353:39.57]That way.
[353:46.25]Shrine?
[353:48.45]Nope.
[353:54.91]I'll find one up here.
[354:09.88]Damn it.
[354:21.96]Relax your eyebrows?
[354:31.25]I'm... I just have deep set eyes!
[354:36.37]My eyes are always in kind of like a frow, whatever it is called.
[354:53.08]There's gonna be secrets up here.
[355:00.33]Gotta be secrets up here, right?
[355:16.36]Furrowed brow, that's right.
[355:40.46]Alright, so what's up here?
[355:54.78]Interesting.
[356:07.23]Come on dude, really?
[356:08.35]I don't have a single arrow.
[356:17.75]You gotta be shitting me.
[357:05.97]And I still get the item.
[357:08.89]I can probably get the torch too.
[357:09.88]Where'd it go?
[357:11.98]That went way over.
[357:20.48]Ah.
[357:22.04]Would you look at that.
[357:24.04]Would you look at that.
[357:27.16]Shrine.
[358:16.62]Ooh, I'll get this tower.
[358:29.30]Oh, I'm almost out of terrible weapons.
[358:31.60]Oh, no, I'm not.
[358:32.54]I got this one now.
[358:51.54]Get down!
[358:52.24]Anything over here?
[359:01.31]I don't think so.
[359:17.17]Zora spear?
[359:17.89]I want to throw this.
[359:43.42]I miss, uh, Sidon's already.
[359:57.45]Oh, the boomerang?
[360:00.19]Ooh, cool.
[360:02.45]I can't... It's cool, but I don't think I want it.
[360:11.00]I'll try it.
[360:20.36]I'm just checking around the sides.
[360:22.12]You never know.
[360:28.34]Stewie Griffin?
[360:31.78]Are you playing Slime Rancher tomorrow?
[360:33.22]No.
[360:33.42]I'm doing birthday stuff tomorrow.
[360:35.56]I'll be back on Saturday.
[360:37.32]We're going to do Slime Rancher 2 on Saturday.
[360:42.40]And then probably back to Breath of the Wild on Sunday.
[361:08.77]You gotta do a birthday stream.
[361:09.99]No, I'm not doing a birthday stream.
[361:11.43]A lot of enemies here.
[361:17.75]A lot of enemies here.
[361:35.83]Thank God.
[361:36.49]Took long enough for me to find some.
[361:43.42]Okay.
[361:44.98]So... Take off... Unequip literally everything, right?
[361:49.24]How do I unequip everything?
[361:56.80]Take off all... Because the lightning shit.
[362:01.58]I'm not holding anything.
[362:02.97]I'm just naked.
[362:03.95]I'm not going to get struck by lightning, right?
[362:08.71]I won't get struck by lightning if I'm naked.
[362:10.25]I hope that's accurate.
[362:19.24]Clothes are fine.
[362:33.47]And wooden weapons are fine.
[362:34.77]I don't think I have anything that's wood.
[362:38.67]I mean, this is metal at the end.
[362:40.21]No, just climbing.
[362:41.23]Are these metal?
[363:02.22]Okay.
[363:22.76]Okay, we're good.
[363:58.53]Clothes do not matter.
[363:59.77]Pants are safe.
[364:01.23]Clothes don't matter.
[364:06.05]Well, I made it up here.
[364:12.42]Pants are safe.
[364:20.95]Alright, here's the plan.
[364:21.83]Two more shrines.
[364:24.21]I'm going to do an Omega turn in, level up twice, and then probably call it there.
[364:29.67]I got one shrine marked.
[364:42.77]Oh, if it's sparking in the menu, it's unsafe.
[364:45.40]That's interesting.
[364:46.00]Okay.
[364:51.10]Good to know.
[364:51.42]Let's take a quick look.
[365:04.19]You can't say Omega when it's not Omega Gaming Weekend.
[365:08.19]That's true.
[365:09.35]No, you're right.
[365:09.83]Okay, that one's marked.
[365:17.50]Any others?
[365:18.34]From here, I could be able to see a lot.
[365:20.14]Um...
[365:24.37]Not that I can see from here.
[365:25.83]I think that's the only one.
[365:34.99]I think that actually is the only one.
[365:40.67]Yeah.
[365:42.31]Really?
[365:42.63]Damn.
[365:43.39]What about here?
[365:43.97]Is that rubble or something?
[365:52.25]Or is that a monster?
[365:56.78]I'm marking it, whatever it is.
[365:57.90]Alright, well, let's go.
[366:05.71]I can't get struck by lightning in the air, but I'm just ready to get struck.
[366:09.07]Look at the menu.
[366:23.52]Oh, okay.
[366:28.88]So these are safe.
[366:32.50]Cool.
[366:39.39]They do a little twinkle.
[367:01.75]I'm too lazy to go pick that up.
[367:08.83]Pretty good snapshot.
[367:18.48]Aw, you ducked.
[367:22.03]Did he just go like this?
[367:23.05]He just put his arms in the air like, I don't know.
[367:57.29]Go.
[367:57.57]I need to heal.
[368:01.79]I have tons of food.
[368:03.49]I really haven't been taking that much damage.
[368:04.81]I die instantly.
[368:05.57]I don't take damage and die.
[368:06.65]Alright.
[368:22.56]You're talking about that one, right?
[368:26.76]Yes, you are.
[368:29.52]What's this little encampment or something?
[368:33.24]What is this?
[368:39.32]Where's my bow?
[368:41.32]Oh, I unequipped it because I freaked out, right?
[368:51.75]Can't turn.
[368:53.35]Got him.
[369:06.42]Okay, what is this?
[369:17.52]Oh, stables, isn't it?
[369:20.77]Horse, horse, horse, horse.
[369:22.25]I already have a horse.
[369:34.99]Oh my god, I hit the horse in the head.
[369:36.51]I'm sorry.
[369:48.44]Cut!
[370:02.77]Hello.
[370:08.17]This thing's going to be free.
[370:09.89]Yeah.
[370:10.55]Go on.
[370:10.77]You're good.
[370:14.21]Where's my horse?
[370:18.07]No, I don't want to register this one.
[370:21.57]I'd like to take my horse, please.
[370:24.57]Frank.
[370:25.85]I want Frank 2, please.
[370:39.64]Okay.
[370:46.24]Alright, let's move.
[370:58.72]Alright, it's been real.
[371:00.38]See you later, Frank 2.
[371:01.68]Bye.
[371:05.16]We got to hang out for 8 seconds.
[371:17.49]I'll have 7 orbs after this.
[371:19.80]I need 8.
[371:34.34]Oh, thanks G4 for the raid.
[371:35.62]G4 TV.
[371:36.54]Appreciate it.
[371:37.12]If any of you guys are still here.
[371:47.22]Combat or puzzle?
[371:51.92]That's a different door.
[371:57.17]It's not a combat trial.
[371:58.31]I think it's a puzzle.
[372:00.97]Metal doors open the way.
[372:18.86]Okay.
[372:30.32]What are you doing here?
[372:33.19]Alright.
[372:34.25]Ooh.
[372:52.69]Yeah.
[372:55.21]I think that bow is not good.
[372:56.61]Five damage?
[372:58.31]Rivalry's bow?
[372:59.01]No thanks.
[373:00.72]We can stay in there.
[373:06.76]Okay, well I can't grab that.
[373:56.83]Tried to rocket jump.
[374:22.62]Figured it was worth a shot.
[374:41.92]Can grab that from here.
[375:08.91]Hmm.
[375:10.83]Hmm.
[376:00.86]okay um I guess okay I think I understand it now
[377:00.42]Oh my god, whatever
[377:58.59]I'm trying to block it.
[378:43.96]Ooh!
[379:21.73]Seven orbs.
[379:35.94]Seven, yep, seven.
[379:38.92]Get the other treasure now.
[379:41.32]That thing sucked.
[379:41.88]It was like a traveler's bow.
[379:51.16]There's a third chest?
[379:52.50]Where?
[380:10.20]Where?
[380:10.44]There's an other treasure hidden here.
[380:15.70]There's a fake wall.
[380:22.13]It's in the wall that you stared at like a moron?
[380:24.99]I wasn't paying attention to what the wall looked like.
[380:33.12]I was trying to do the puzzle.
[380:39.32]The wall that you were staring at.
[380:44.05]Like a moron.
[380:57.27]Okay.
[381:01.09]Not in here.
[381:27.07]Just die, just kill this thing.
[381:32.66]Oh my god, this thing sucks.
[381:41.80]Oh my god, did I really just get this?
[381:48.91]Okay.
[381:53.55]I'll take a free guardian spear.
[381:57.00]Alright.
[381:57.92]So where is this thing that I was looking at?
[382:00.18]Like a moron!
[382:03.02]There's a hidden wall that I was looking at?
[382:08.72]Look at the walls.
[382:10.30]Use magnetic and look at the walls.
[382:27.58]Yeah, I didn't... Sorry, I didn't see this.
[382:30.52]I wasn't paying attention to the... No, I didn't see it.
[382:41.76]No, I... No, I didn't.
[382:46.22]That's 300 rupees, though.
[382:47.04]That's pretty good.
[382:49.57]You did look at it.
[382:50.91]You just didn't notice it.
[382:52.05]And then in brackets, like a moron.
[382:55.71]Like a moron.
[383:00.80]He's pretending for content.
[383:03.66]Hey, got to get that 300 hour Breath of the Wild playthrough.
[383:15.98]OK, so I want one more shrine.
[383:17.18]Am I going to be able to find one over here?
[383:26.75]I'm going to say this way.
[383:40.24]Bring Frank too.
[383:42.22]Alright.
[383:43.64]Come on Frank too.
[384:02.50]Why am I sitting on this like a weirdo?
[384:05.14]Oh.
[384:12.08]Oh, okay.
[384:14.16]I thought Frank too just moved.
[384:18.19]Why can't I walk up the wall?
[384:52.71]This isn't Skyrim, moron.
[384:58.94]Like a moron.
[385:08.15]Grind!
[385:15.37]Where's it at?
[385:27.53]This way.
[385:36.44]This way.
[385:38.10]Alright, there it is.
[385:47.48]Well, then let's go the long way down here.
[385:56.56]You can make that jump.
[385:58.06]I know it's not Skyrim, but it's, come on.
[386:12.19]No!
[386:13.09]No, I'm not doing it.
[386:14.33]Alright, fine.
[386:16.99]I'll do it.
[386:18.39]Okay.
[386:30.27]Ready to go?
[386:49.88]Alright, come on down.
[387:12.76]It seems Frank 2 isn't able to come.
[387:15.10]Okay.
[387:17.72]Fine.
[387:18.14]I don't know if sometimes there's the little forest creatures.
[387:42.97]Alright, this is the last shrine we're doing tonight.
[387:44.75]Then I'm gonna go level up twice.
[387:52.16]And then, uh... I'm gonna, like, half hour?
[387:58.30]You need to have... You need Ancient Horse here.
[388:00.49]That's cool.
[388:17.00]Combat trial or a puzzle trial?
[388:18.54]I know.
[388:23.94]This is a combat trial.
[388:24.90]I got plenty of good weapons.
[388:28.76]I should be able to do this pretty easily.
[388:32.72]Minor test of strength.
[388:33.97]Okay.
[388:34.99]I'll be fine.
[388:35.73]At least I hope so.
[388:51.28]I shouldn't use a fishing harpoon though.
[388:57.22]Use this thing.
[389:06.99]Why won't you dodge sideways?
[389:29.45]Dodge sideways!
[389:35.05]Finally!
[389:36.05]What the heck is happening?
[390:16.65]Uh-oh.
[390:17.53]Did you do this thing?
[390:27.06]Get out of here.
[390:32.28]Guardian sword and another guardian shield.
[390:40.05]Yep.
[390:42.01]Can't carry any more shields.
[390:45.27]Yes, I can.
[390:58.71]It's the same thing.
[390:59.83]I'll get rid of this one then.
[391:00.63]Yep.
[391:14.88]Yeah.
[391:15.30]Wait, 16 and 8.
[391:16.58]Whatever.
[391:18.41]Keep the wood one.
[391:19.53]I thought this one was 18.
[391:22.09]Okay, 16.
[391:22.35]I thought it was 18.
[391:23.83]Alright.
[391:28.70]So all the Guardian Shield Plus.
[391:32.04]Okay.
[391:32.88]Cool.
[391:35.79]Where's your Nintendo shirt?
[391:37.05]I had it on for like four hours.
[391:38.47]It was just getting really sweaty and hot, so I had to take it off.
[391:48.35]Boomerang?
[391:50.03]I don't want that.
[391:50.62]It's probably better than this.
[392:06.64]Cool.
[392:07.52]Okay.
[392:08.34]Now I need to go back to the village.
[392:12.92]And I'm going to level up stamina twice.
[392:18.34]Is that bad?
[392:18.78]Or should I do health twice?
[392:20.54]I feel like I need the hearts.
[392:23.36]I'm going to do hearts twice.
[392:30.64]Yeah.
[392:33.34]I only have four.
[392:44.93]Yeah, I gotta stop.
[392:45.57]Yeah, I'm a four health Andy, I know.
[392:47.25]It's bad.
[392:49.17]Maybe I won't get one hit killed by the regular enemies anymore if I had six hearts.
[392:52.73]Did we scream?
[393:07.41]Okay.
[393:08.83]So, I'm good.
[393:10.29]I'm gonna go back to... Uh, where's that?
[393:16.63]Where do I need to go here?
[393:21.12]Where's that thing?
[393:23.80]Shrine Island?
[393:31.41]All towns have a statue.
[393:33.01]Oh, okay.
[393:33.45]Well, I'll just go back to... Here.
[393:37.56]Next to Impa.
[393:42.32]Two hearts.
[393:42.70]Oh, I'm going to break that.
[393:52.77]Yeah, the seed guy too.
[393:53.59]I'll do that as well.
[393:55.85]Just cleaning up some loose ends.
[393:57.64]That's all.
[394:09.02]Alright, so they're staying right next to Impa's house.
[394:12.97]Which is here, right?
[394:38.33]Want a heart container.
[394:39.19]I'm doing two.
[394:53.02]Very good.
[394:53.24]Do it again.
[395:12.78]Alright, that feels pretty good.
[395:18.95]Now I want to go back to... I marked you on the map right here, right?
[395:25.87]Okay, I'll just walk here.
[395:47.10]Upgrade your armor.
[395:52.06]Oh, that's right.
[395:52.84]That's right, that's right, that's right.
[395:54.60]Alright, we're going to go there first.
[396:03.45]Still there?
[396:08.17]So, I'm going to upgrade my chest piece first.
[396:17.64]You still might be there?
[396:18.30]Okay.
[397:01.80]Welcome back.
[397:06.40]Enhance away, let's go.
[397:07.64]Alright, so the chest piece goes from three to five.
[397:13.83]Or I could do the helmet.
[397:17.63]Three to five, three to five is the same thing.
[397:23.55]Maybe the armor?
[397:27.98]I really like the helmet.
[397:30.32]Because if I find a much better chest piece, I could still keep the helmet on.
[397:34.30]I'm doing it.
[397:48.25]Thank you.
[397:48.57]Five armor.
[397:57.64]Nice.
[398:02.76]A set of clothes that have all been enhanced twice can have a bonus.
[398:06.46]But you have to wear the whole thing.
[398:07.56]Can I do anything else?
[398:17.43]I mean, I'm wearing the pants.
[398:26.98]I mean, why not?
[398:42.63]How hard is it to find?
[398:43.59]I feel like these materials are not hard to get, so I'm just going to do it.
[398:51.28]Just in case.
[398:51.90]At least the level one stuff.
[399:07.77]Very cool.
[399:11.78]Okay, now I did two car containers.
[399:16.74]Upgraded my gear.
[399:22.52]That was step one of two.
[399:24.39]Now I'm going over here.
[399:25.63]To see if that guy's there to do inventory slots.
[399:40.31]And then I'm going to wrap it up.
[399:49.22]Doesn't do this.
[399:49.96]I don't know what to do with this.
[399:52.92]The ball somewhere.
[400:14.32]You can do this again next stream.
[400:15.48]I will do this again on Sunday.
[400:20.09]Plan is to do... Slime Rancher 2 comes into early access tomorrow.
[400:26.69]So I'll do that on Saturday.
[400:29.26]And we'll hop back into Breath of the Wild on Sunday.
[400:31.24]And then after that, we'll see.
[400:33.88]We will see.
[400:43.09]You actually want to keep playing this?
[400:46.11]Yeah, I mean, if you guys like watching it, then why not?
[400:49.09]I'm having a good time.
[400:50.19]If you like it, if you want me to continue and you want me to beat it, then I'll just keep playing it.
[401:02.08]Yeah, definitely.
[401:08.23]Alright, where are you?
[401:11.61]Yeah, you're still there.
[401:19.12]Alright, I got five of these.
[401:24.75]Alright.
[401:26.05]I... Another weapon stash.
[401:30.83]I go through weapons so crazy.
[401:33.08]And then maybe... Shield?
[401:35.28]What about Splatoon 3?
[401:37.22]I'll do that too at some point.
[401:56.08]Wait, what?
[401:57.88]Bring some to Korok Forest.
[402:01.74]Ah, whatever.
[402:10.12]Okay, well, at least I did that.
[402:12.74]See you later.
[402:13.10]Speaking of see you later.
[402:16.80]I'll see you later.
[402:39.75]North of here.
[402:40.63]Follow the Hylia River and continue north.
[402:42.61]Okay.
[402:45.43]Yeah, I'll see you later.
[402:46.99]The next couple days I'm going to do some birthday stuff.
[402:48.69]I appreciate everyone hanging out though.
[402:54.05]Maybe we'll see you again.
[402:54.75]A couple days.
[402:59.01]Slime Rancher 2 going into early... I don't know how much content will be in Slime Rancher 2 as early access, so...
[403:05.26]I will find out.
[403:06.18]But I'll see you later.
[403:16.26]Thanks for watching.
[403:18.11]Save your game.
[403:18.71]I will do it right now.
[403:22.39]Officially saved.
[403:28.21]Okay.
[403:31.25]There were a shitload of subs today.
[403:35.99]This is 25 pages of subs.
[403:38.08]Are you kidding me?
[403:38.58]Oh my god.
[403:42.90]Well, thank you.
[403:52.55]I'll have a good birthday.
[403:53.35]I'm just gonna be chill.
[404:05.58]Are prime subs included in the credits?
[404:07.14]I think all subs are.
[404:08.84]Any sub that comes through during the time the stream is live, I think is there.
[404:15.61]Yeah, there was some big gifted subs too.
[404:17.45]Yeah.
[404:29.69]I'm sure probably some of you saw the news about Twitch is changing how they're monetizing partners.
[404:37.57]Let me just be very clear.
[404:38.62]I ain't fucking running ads.
[404:44.72]It's just not happening.
[404:46.42]So we'll see however that plays out.
[404:57.75]I mean, I obviously have opinions on it.
[405:02.37]And, you know, one of the major ones is I don't want to be forced to run ads.
[405:09.19]Because in my mind, a ton of people are already paying essentially a premium to the stream.
[405:20.00]So, I don't... Oh, yeah, thanks for your essentially kind of like Netflix-like subscription.
[405:26.54]Here's a shitload of ads every day.
[405:29.62]I don't want to do that.
[405:31.92]So I'm not going to.
[405:35.43]Um...
[405:36.94]If I am forced to run ads on this platform, I will leave this platform.
[405:46.39]100%.
[405:53.43]So I'm not going to be forced to run ads.
[406:00.45]Now, here's the thing.
[406:01.89]Ads do play.
[406:03.09]Pre-rolls play.
[406:04.59]And I don't really have that much control over that.
[406:06.95]I do have control over if one essentially runs while you're sitting here.
[406:12.45]And... I don't want to do that.
[406:15.13]I don't want to run ads.
[406:17.77]You've seen ads on big streams before.
[406:20.21]Sometimes to fill dead air.
[406:22.75]Sometimes part of an obligation.
[406:29.20]But regardless of how they're changing subscription revenue, I'm not going to run ads.
[406:40.02]Let's run an ad right now.
[406:42.68]Ads aren't that bad.
[406:44.06]Ads aren't that bad.
[406:46.16]They really aren't in the grand scheme of things.
[406:48.59]It depends on how many you run.
[406:50.73]But I don't want to be forced to do them.
[406:56.27]The thing about ads, especially on Twitch, they're pretty intrusive for a few reasons.
[407:00.49]One, if they happen automatically, we could be in the middle of doing something and you're just gone for two to three straight fucking minutes.
[407:11.59]It takes over the whole screen.
[407:13.72]You don't even, what if you missed something interesting?
[407:17.56]Like one of eight or like one of four or one of three, whatever it is.
[407:21.98]Now, running ads on a BRB is something that, okay, yeah, maybe that would make sense.
[407:27.20]But I don't want to be forced to run ads.
[407:40.41]If you're contractually obligated to run ads, yeah.
[407:43.87]That's not the case right now.
[407:47.11]But I don't want that to be the case.
[407:48.81]And if it does become the case, I'll just leave.
[407:53.14]I mean that.
[407:54.06]I really do.
[408:03.13]The phrase ads aren't that bad is a weak mindset.
[408:05.71]You are okay with what happened.
[408:06.85]Losing imperfection.
[408:07.80]Is that a meme?
[408:10.20]What is that?
[408:23.63]Oh, it's the ninja thing, okay But I just want to be clear about that because I know that a lot of people might be saying oh shit
[408:35.77]which is changing how the money and he he's gonna quote have to make up the money no I don't give a fuck no I don't care if you I want people to have the best viewing experience if I can I'm not gonna just run ads if I have to I'll just I'll literally stream I'll literally make fucking videos again or something I don't know
[409:14.49]Yeah, I don't know.
[409:16.01]I'm not going to make any statements about.
[409:18.55]I have some ideas of maybe I would want to change platforms or something, right?
[409:23.43]That's not what this is for.
[409:25.45]A lot of these changes are not even happening till like the middle of next year.
[409:31.14]So there's lots of time to figure out what I would want to do.
[409:38.97]and if Twitch changes a lot of their policies to make it so you have to run ads or something it's like I don't know I'd rather just stream off like youtube and not have to do that if I didn't have to and let me maybe make videos again I don't know I really don't know but I'm trying to be transparent with everybody right now um
[410:07.79]And that's me being transparent.
[410:15.15]We got about 10 months before this is even a question to even figure out.
[410:21.39]So don't worry.
[410:21.93]It's not like, oh, alright.
[410:22.91]Well, see you on YouTube tomorrow.
[410:26.69]No, this is like a year away before a major decision like that will have to get made.
[410:35.32]But I'm going... I'm going to be where I think is the best viewing experience for people here.
[410:43.71]Regardless of how much money I would or would not be making or would or would be losing.
[410:48.21]Whatever.
[410:50.17]We'll see.
[410:51.37]We'll see.
[410:53.27]But have a great night.
[410:54.72]I'm going to go do birthday stuff.
[410:59.86]Have a great night, guys.
[411:01.90]Take care of yourselves.
[411:07.17]There is a trombone game, isn't there?
[411:10.73]I see people play the trombone game.
[411:12.90]Is it fun?
[411:13.16]Should I do it?
[411:21.40]Yes, please.
[411:22.26]Okay.
[411:32.96]It looks fun.
[411:33.58]Alright.
[411:35.28]Good night, guys.
[411:36.08]See you soon.
[411:36.50]Take care of yourselves.
[411:39.03]Goodbye.
[411:40.41]See you Saturday.
