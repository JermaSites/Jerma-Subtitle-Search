[02:49.03]I was surprised.
[02:49.65]I was happy when it was gonna come out on PC.
[02:51.55]It's a Microsoft published game at this point.
[02:54.99]Unfortunately, I wish I could play this with somebody else, but it's only couch co-op.
[02:59.16]But it's alright.
[03:00.60]It's okay.
[03:03.04]Just gonna give it a second while I get myself situated.

[03:52.38]How's that sound?
[03:52.96]Is that good?
[03:58.30]Maybe one notch.

[04:02.38]That sounds alright to me.
[04:06.26]Controls.
[04:06.70]I'm just using a PlayStation 4 controller, so hopefully this works out well.

[04:16.72]I am not going to get stuck on the tutorial.
[04:19.51]I can promise you that.
[04:24.99]Unless I'm going to make a specific tutorial joke.

[04:33.58]Where is... There we go.
[04:43.55]Oh, come on, Twitch.
[04:44.53]Why is your dashboard so terrible?
[04:49.37]What's with your terrible dashboard, Twitch?
[04:54.63]Okay, I'm ready.
[04:56.65]Let's get started.
[04:57.91]No more dicking around.
[04:58.77]I'm stalling.
[05:01.61]Here we go.
[05:04.26]New, new, new.
[05:04.84]The game is brand new, as you can tell.
[05:06.22]Alright, here comes a cutscene, probably.
[05:11.64]Cuphead, Don't Deal with the Devil, produced by the Moldenhauer brothers.
[05:16.22]Once upon a time, in a magical place called Inkwell Isle, there were two brothers named Cuphead and Mugman.
[05:22.29]They lived without a care under the watchful eye of the wise Elder Kettle.
[05:26.93]One day, the two boys wandered far from home, and despite the Elder Kettle's many warnings, ended up on the wrong side of the tracks and entered the Devil's Casino.
[05:35.08]I've been there before.
[05:37.46]Inside, Cuphead and Mugman soon found themselves on a winning streak at the craps table.
[05:41.81]Hot dog, exclaimed King Dice, the casino's sleazy manager.
[05:45.33]These fellas can't lose.
[05:50.01]Nice run, boys.
[05:52.35]Laughed a newcomer.
[05:53.48]The brothers gasped.
[05:54.80]It was the casino's owner, the devil himself.
[05:57.84]Now, how about we raise the stakes?
[06:00.94]He suggested with a toothy grin.
[06:04.69]With one more roll and all the loot in my casino is yours, the devil boomed.
[06:09.45]But if you lose, I'll have your souls.
[06:13.26]Deal?
[06:15.16]Cuphead, blinded by easy riches, nodded and grabbed the dice for a throw.
[06:20.30]Good gosh, Cuphead, no, cried Mugman, for he understood the danger.
[06:24.37]But it was too late.
[06:26.69]Snake eyes.
[06:31.13]Laughed the devil while slamming the floor.
[06:34.20]You lose!
[06:35.60]The brothers trembled in fear as he loomed over them.
[06:37.92]Now about those souls... They... Bleeding.
[06:42.13]They pleaded for their lives.
[06:44.81]There must be another way we can repay you!
[06:47.34]Mugman stammered.
[06:48.74]Yes.
[06:51.28]Yes, please, mister, Cuphead added.
[06:54.52]Perhaps there is.
[06:56.06]The devil snickered, pulling out a parchment.
[06:58.70]I have here a list of my runaway debtors.
[07:01.52]Collect their souls for me, and I might just pardon you two mugs.
[07:06.02]Now get going.
[07:06.96]The devil roared, kicking the boys out most rudely.
[07:09.72]You have till midnight tomorrow to collect every one of those souls.
[07:13.37]Otherwise, I'll be one collecting yours.
[07:17.20]Cuphead and Mugman were terribly frightened and ran away as fast as they could.
[07:22.76]Come on, Mug, panted Cuphead.
[07:24.68]We have to find the Elder Kettle.
[07:26.14]He'll know what to do.
[07:33.55]We're having fun here tonight.
[07:39.95]What a fine pickle you boys have gotten yourselves into.
[07:43.85]I know you don't want to be pawned to the devil, but if you refuse, I can't bear to imagine your fates.
[07:50.89]You must play along for now and collect those contracts, and you'd best be ready for some nasty businesses.
[07:58.43]Your tenor friends won't be very friendly once you confront them.
[08:03.31]In fact, I expect they'll transform into terrible beasts.
[08:06.54]Take this potion so they won't hang you out to dry.
[08:10.23]It'll give you the most remarkable magical abilities.
[08:13.86]Now go to my writing desk and use the mystical ink there.
[08:18.36]You need to prepare yourself for a scrap.
[08:21.92]Oh, golly.
[08:22.58]Of course I will.

[09:14.74]Parry slap.
[09:16.28]There's a parry?
[09:18.20]Wait, what's A?

[12:21.36]Well, I used to be the same way, always getting into trouble, running, jumping, shooting.

[17:19.07]God, this is... Now I understand.
[17:20.99]Now I understand this game is fucking brutal.
[17:27.37]I gotta take it slow.
[17:28.95]I'm just learning how to play that.
[17:29.83]I'm just getting the control steady.
[17:37.94]I can't die three times in the first level.
[17:39.88]That means I'm just awful.
[17:40.86]I know it doesn't.
[17:51.10]I didn't know those things blew up.
[17:58.80]I'll get it on this one.
[17:59.76]I'm good.
[18:02.23]Just gotta watch your back.
[18:04.11]This game tries to fuck with you.
[18:05.19]Like, they're sending guys from behind.
[18:15.69]See, I just have to learn the control.
[18:16.71]That's all I had to do.
[18:20.71]You can't fucking cry over spilled orange juice.
[18:22.89]You know what I'm saying?
[18:23.47]That guy's gonna- That guy's gonna pop back up.

[19:31.96]Gotta B. I'm already being a B streamer.
[19:35.40]Okay, cool.
[19:35.80]So I have nine coins.
[19:36.82]Let me see what's in here.
[19:57.30]V-list celebrity.
[20:00.76]Okay, what do I want?
[20:03.50]Jumbo.
[20:03.96]Great coverage with average damage.
[20:05.38]Aim backwards for maximum range.
[20:07.63]You will not take damage during a dash.
[20:10.63]Okay.
[20:14.41]This is just literal iframes.
[20:17.41]Okay.
[20:18.23]Yes.
[20:18.79]Give me that.
[20:21.79]Automatic parry.
[20:26.22]Oh, man.
[20:28.50]Short range with great damage if you can keep close to your target.
[20:32.54]Chaos Chaser.
[20:33.46]Extra hit point.
[20:34.36]No, I don't want to do that.
[20:37.76]This is just like fucking Dark Souls.
[20:39.38]See, they even have the weird jelly ice cream tofu like they have in Dark Souls.
[20:53.25]I kind of want this, too.
[20:57.66]Maybe this.
[20:58.46]Great coverage with average damage.
[20:59.86]Aim backward for maximum range.
[21:05.57]No, I want the shotgun.
[21:06.95]Give me the shotgun.
[21:07.63]Yep.
[21:11.61]We have to put it on.
[21:18.68]You've got guts to equip those new purchases if you want to use them.
[21:22.44]Look at your equip card, you bum.
[21:27.42]Okay, so I got P shooter.
[21:30.06]So shot B, super charm smoke bomb.
[21:34.42]Alright, you'll not take damage during a dash.
[21:36.80]That's like, why would I ever take this off?
[21:40.10]So I have shot A and shot B. So it's a different, it's a different.
[21:46.81]Okay, what the hell does that mean?
[21:49.59]Playing Dark Souls without vitality.
[21:53.47]Anything up here?
[21:54.01]What is this?
[21:54.79]I can talk to the tree?
[21:57.42]Goopy Legrand, ruse of an ooze.
[22:03.23]So what, you pick a difficulty each level?
[22:06.49]Is that what I'm understanding here?
[22:09.15]It's down here.
[22:09.59]So I'm kind of like, alright, there's a fish.
[22:16.32]Be gone, spirits.
[22:17.32]Oh wait, you're real.
[22:18.92]I was about to hit you with the old parry move.
[22:21.66]That's, oh my, this is a fish.
[22:26.62]That's how you deal with ghosts around here!
[22:31.70]Only a nitwit tries to shoot somebody that ain't really there.
[22:35.08]Speaking of not being play- I couldn't do it.
[22:37.02]Would you fellas mind moving on?
[22:38.20]And you spooking the fish.
[22:44.26]So what is it?
[22:44.74]Is it a coffee shop?
[22:46.37]Mausoleum 1.
[22:51.03]What is it?
[22:54.57]Wait, what?
[22:55.09]What just happened?
[22:55.55]Don't shoot this thing.
[23:17.31]Uh, okay.
[23:17.89]This match will get red hot.
[23:22.18]Alright, these guys are pink.
[23:24.60]Okay, here we are.
[23:25.48]I figured it out.
[23:30.12]This match is about to get red hot.
[23:33.18]Stay in the middle.
[23:33.66]Just like every game.
[23:35.18]Whack-a-mole.
[23:35.72]You gotta stay in the middle.
[23:41.07]Don't ever stay on either one of these sides.
[23:42.43]That's a tip from a gamer like me.
[23:48.85]I just got an achievement.
[23:50.51]Come on, come on, come on.
[23:58.68]Shit!
[23:58.94]You can parry as many times as you want, as long as you hit it, I guess.
[24:08.94]Is this the Oogie Boogie song?
[24:15.85]This is the Oogie Boogie theme song.
[24:18.03]No, the Christmas one when they're like... Victory!
[24:21.73]Put it in a box.
[24:23.30]Take him and then throw him down the well and then add rocks.
[24:29.98]Gosh, I didn't know how... I don't know how to thank you boys for saving me.
[24:33.87]Where are my manners?
[24:34.67]I didn't even introduce myself.
[24:36.49]I'm known as the Legendary Chalice.
[24:38.95]Pleased to meet you.
[24:40.34]I was searching for a magic and got trapped by those ghosts.

[26:12.87]But thank you guys, all of you.
[26:15.13]Very much appreciated.
[26:18.03]Super.
[26:18.65]A devastating attack spills from your head, horizontal only.
[26:23.47]How do I do it?
[26:26.17]Let's see what this person has to say.
[26:32.96]I'm not gonna be able to fucking do it.
[26:35.64]I tried.
[26:36.04]I have to, like, tilt my head up because the microphone is here.
[26:39.48]Might make the fishing even better here.
[26:40.74]Might not.
[26:41.38]You know, I give up.
[26:42.94]You're not gonna get any comedy from me this stream.
[26:44.53]This is a fucking pay attention and beat the game stream.
[26:47.17]No joking, no comedy.
[26:48.47]How do I get up there?
[26:53.37]I can't get up there.
[26:57.45]Is there any other way I can go?
[27:01.99]Up here?
[27:12.41]Yes.
[27:14.19]Okay.
[27:16.16]Cool.
[27:17.98]Go fight the tree.
[27:23.68]Oh, I get it.
[27:25.84]I get it.
[27:29.25]So this is, I thought, ah ha ha ha, regular.
[27:33.31]Regular.
[27:34.35]This match will get red hot.
[27:36.25]Here comes the potato.
[27:43.10]Whoa, wait.
[27:43.68]I want to put on the shotgun here.
[27:45.76]It's getting close to fucking annihilate.
[27:49.78]Do I have to, I think I have to parry that.
[27:54.02]Parry the snake.
[28:01.66]Oh, this is fucking awesome.
[28:06.70]I can dash, too, right?
[28:07.68]Hold on.
[28:07.98]I'm gonna test something.
[28:08.76]I gotta test something here.
[28:11.85]Oh, that's fucking awesome.
[28:13.21]Oh, my God.
[28:14.39]What a game.
[28:15.57]What a game.
[28:25.12]Eat shit.
[28:30.03]This guy just got super'd.
[28:32.15]Whoa!
[28:35.37]Oh, whoops!
[28:35.77]Wrong button.
[28:39.43]Oh, he just cries?
[28:40.33]Oh god.
[28:44.21]I just- I tried to push triangle to change weapons.
[28:45.97]I'm playing too much Dark Souls!
[28:49.98]Wow, that's different.
[28:50.76]Okay.
[28:51.00]Yeah, I've played too many Dark Souls games.
[28:57.61]He's like the weird corn guy.
[29:00.47]Oh, Christ.
[29:04.39]Can I shoot him?
[29:05.01]I can.
[29:15.26]Whoa!
[29:15.58]I gotta be, like, quiet here.
[29:21.37]Almost got me.
[29:23.01]Victory!
[29:23.51]This is fucking a ton of fun.
[29:25.89]I love this game.
[29:27.07]Cover your ears.
[29:27.97]Oh my god, it's so loud.
[29:50.50]It's almost like... Oh my god.
[29:52.84]Is that dude seriously?
[29:55.88]It's as if somebody is breaking bones in my eardrums.
[30:02.52]Oh, then it unlocks the rest of the level.
[30:05.16]Soul Contract.
[30:06.34]The Root Pack.
[30:08.39]I was trying to read that.
[30:09.25]You got the Root Pack, Soul Contract.
[30:10.75]Cool.
[30:10.99]Let's see.
[30:11.47]Old Devil's Office.
[30:14.23]That's really cool.
[30:15.71]And you can go back, obviously, and take care of that.
[30:20.16]So what about the hammer?
[30:20.98]I've got to think of a voice for this guy.
[30:25.16]He's always frowning.
[30:28.16]I'll be a monkey's uncle if I'm putting my moolah in the bank.
[30:32.04]For all I know, the devil probably controls the place too.
[30:36.84]He'll never get a hold of my gold if I spread it all around.
[30:39.70]And if some Joe happens to find a coin or two good for him, that's what I say.
[30:50.88]That voice was fucking terrible.
[30:52.28]Hold on, let me try this again.
[31:02.02]I'm so excited, I can't help it.
[31:04.96]Clip joint calamity.
[31:09.62]Oh, two frogs!
[31:12.22]Oh, this is fucking cool.
[31:13.96]Two frogs!
[31:18.52]Okay, I get it.
[31:20.73]I get it.
[31:23.65]Oh, I can't parry those.
[31:24.67]I'm gonna die.
[31:25.39]Okay, that guy can be- they can be blocked.
[31:34.39]Here he comes, with the punches.
[31:40.89]Alright, I'm trying to like... I gotta switch weapons.
[31:51.70]I'm trying to be too fancy with it, I don't need to parry that many... Just gotta dodge.
[32:00.93]Oh, fuck!
[32:06.72]And get in real close.
[32:12.10]Just don't jump.
[32:13.22]I just jumped into him.
[32:14.12]I was about to say, don't jump into him.
[32:17.57]Just hang out back here.
[32:18.41]Yeah, I got it.
[32:25.93]Should I kill the big brother or little brother first?
[32:35.27]Come out!
[32:35.95]Whoa!
[32:36.21]What's he doing?
[32:37.97]He's gonna jo- yep.
[32:41.63]Oh, now they're on either side.
[32:42.59]Oh, Jesus Christ, what is he doing?
[32:46.18]Okay!
[32:47.60]Alright, so he blows the- he does the fan.
[32:53.16]I was halfway there.
[32:54.68]This match will get red hot.
[32:57.29]Now go!
[32:58.71]And I- I- I- I'm telling you to triangle.
[33:00.81]Triangle's gonna fucking mess me up.
[33:08.41]Don't go out and do anything fancy.
[33:14.68]Let him come down to me.
[33:18.34]It's all about the spam.
[33:23.05]Oh, goddammit.
[33:24.01]Oh my god, I just fucking forgot all the buttons.
[33:27.93]I literally just forgot every button.
[33:37.60]Come on, switch.
[33:39.18]He does the fan, and you gotta... Okay, watch out for the dive.
[33:44.47]I have to run forward, because he's gonna do the blow.
[33:47.47]Right?
[33:52.01]Okay, I got it.
[33:55.14]Mr. Fan.
[33:55.88]Did he change back?
[34:00.38]Oh, ouch.
[34:04.03]Alright, I got it.
[34:04.51]I'll get it for next time.
[34:05.17]I don't know if I'm gonna make it this time.
[34:06.15]Who knows?
[34:06.47]Well, let me call my homie, huh?
[34:13.02]Am I invincible?
[34:14.20]Can I do that?
[34:14.68]I hope I am.
[34:21.56]Come on!
[34:22.24]Whoa!
[34:23.04]What's that?
[34:23.40]What's that?
[34:23.70]What's this?
[34:24.42]What are they doing?
[34:25.48]He's going in his mouth!
[34:27.12]What the fuck?
[34:29.58]Uh...
[34:33.86]Oh, I gotta like get the jackpot here.
[34:35.62]Did I get it?
[34:37.10]I don't know what that- I don't know what this means!
[34:41.49]Oh, Jesus, I can stand on these, I can stand on these.
[34:43.85]Ah!
[34:45.31]Oh, this is great, I love it.

[35:05.51]This fucking game is awesome.
[35:11.27]All of the- You just gotta stand still.
[35:15.38]Okay, now I can stay back here, and shoot like this.
[35:19.94]It's all about- If only- The ones that come forward, like that, are the ones you have to worry about.
[35:23.58]Then switch to the shotgun, here we go.
[35:26.50]It ain't no big deal.
[35:28.85]They'll come to you.
[35:29.55]Don't even jump.
[35:30.17]No reason to.
[35:33.43]Then comes the super spin.
[35:34.37]He's gonna die.
[35:34.79]They're gonna jump around.
[35:35.65]In a second.
[35:36.01]Here it comes.
[35:38.31]And then here we go.
[35:42.31]Make it happen!
[35:49.10]Oh, Jesus!
[35:50.02]That was close.
[35:52.36]This is phase two.
[35:53.08]I'll get to phase three here in a sec.
[36:00.37]How am I ever gonna take off that thing?
[36:01.57]I don't know how.
[36:03.23]Alright, I got the super, so I'm gonna use it at the cash register.
[36:09.25]Fuck, I dashed too far.
[36:12.43]Dammit, I really wanted three.
[36:15.11]Come on!

[36:47.49]What the fuck?
[36:48.60]No!
[36:50.94]Oh, god damn it!
[36:52.82]Oh, right when you come... Right when you come out of the super, it's not... Oh, fuck!
[37:00.36]That was a terrible idea.
[37:01.76]Alright, we're not gonna...
[37:05.28]That was total panic.
[37:08.78]I'm not even gonna use the super.
[37:10.08]That puts you in such a bad situation.
[37:11.86]Oh my god, I love this.
[37:16.37]This is so much fun.
[37:17.73]I love it.
[37:20.49]No super.
[37:22.43]It pauses the screen for too long.
[37:33.57]I don't even care that this is, like, my eighth attempt on this boss.
[37:36.01]It's awesome.
[37:36.97]This is so much fun.
[37:40.57]Here we go.
[37:41.99]Don't get hit here.
[37:42.71]I want to, like, skip this part as much as I can.
[37:48.40]Get him.
[37:55.50]Oh, here we go.
[38:00.62]Good, good, good.
[38:01.16]Three, three, three.
[38:03.65]Come on.
[38:04.41]End it.
[38:04.63]End it and then don't panic on the next thing.
[38:13.89]How many more times do I have to shoot you, dude?
[38:15.43]Come on!
[38:19.89]That's it, right?
[38:24.77]There we go.
[38:25.13]Alright, here we go.
[38:28.95]Don't fucking panic.
[38:31.36]Can I get in his mouth?
[38:32.72]I'm gonna try it, right?
[38:33.40]You have to.
[38:33.78]I have to try.
[38:37.44]No, I'm just gonna stay back here and be easy.
[38:39.01]Wait, uh, this is different.
[38:39.85]This is different.
[38:40.31]It's like a fucking tiger.
[38:46.99]I prefer this one.
[38:51.55]Alright, just gotta dodge.
[38:52.59]Alright, be easy.
[38:54.29]Easy, easy.
[38:55.37]Oh, come on.
[38:55.81]That was, that was fucking, that was planned.
[38:57.45]That was bullshit.
[38:59.39]What is that, a snake?
[39:02.25]Can I jump on top?
[39:11.95]That was hard to shoot.
[39:12.97]What are you gonna give me now?
[39:17.15]Give me that one again.
[39:17.67]Give me the tiger.
[39:19.33]Aw, not this one.
[39:19.95]Fuck.
[39:25.75]Don't panic.
[39:30.22]Oh, fuck, I'm panicking.
[39:31.16]I don't know what it is about that one.
[39:32.22]I can't do that one.
[39:33.62]That one freaks out my brain.
[39:39.00]Okay, I can do the snake.
[39:51.47]No!
[39:51.77]No!
[40:10.59]Oh, my brain!
[40:11.23]Okay, I'm fine.
[40:17.91]What's it gonna be?
[40:19.24]The cat.
[40:19.50]I forget what this one is.
[40:24.34]Oh, that was good.
[40:24.98]Fun.
[40:25.66]Love it.
[40:29.90]Sorry, loud noises.
[40:30.82]I can't do anything about it.
[40:38.83]I can't believe it's this loud.
[40:40.15]That's fucking crazy, man.
[40:46.31]Does it have to be that loud?
[40:53.70]Very cool.
[40:54.04]Let's see.
[41:00.08]I know, it's alright.
[41:01.20]That one was just too many things for my brain to have to see.
[41:04.33]Ribby and Crocs.
[41:05.69]You got the Ribby and Crocs soul.
[41:09.83]There's this guy again.
[41:10.83]I can go over.
[41:12.39]Here.
[41:12.95]I missed one, didn't I?
[41:17.65]This game looks amazing.
[41:18.51]This game so far is amazing.
[41:21.27]What a fucking great game.
[41:25.34]Bruise of a news.
[41:27.56]Here we go.
[41:31.94]You can hold the shoot button.
[41:32.88]I don't.
[41:35.04]But I'm one of those old school video gamers where you used to tap A as fast as you can or B.
[41:41.92]Well, okay.
[41:42.68]That's a noob.
[41:43.46]In fact, let me do this.
[41:48.82]Nope.
[41:49.12]Dodge, dodge, dodge.
[41:49.70]Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[41:52.59]Oh my lord.
[41:54.79]What is his change?
[41:56.45]What is his phase two?
[41:57.39]That's what I need to know.
[42:02.87]I do like the...
[42:09.51]Kim just like snuck in it.
[42:10.52]She's like, sorry.
[42:11.38]Alright, hold on.
[42:12.92]Wait, wait, wait.
[42:13.38]Give me a second.
[42:13.94]Hold on.
[42:32.27]She's going to like pick up my prescription.
[42:35.81]And she's like, hey, is your prescription ready?
[42:37.21]And I'm just like... She's like, I'm sorry.
[42:42.63]Alright, we gotta retry.
[42:45.07]It's alright, we didn't see shit.
[42:46.07]No matter.
[42:49.80]Oh man, yeah.
[42:53.16]I gotta get my prescription.
[43:00.52]I'm an old piece of shit.
[43:01.38]I have to take a bunch of stuff from my heart.
[43:03.73]I got high blood pressure and shit.
[43:08.23]Ah, damn it.
[43:08.78]No, no, no.
[43:09.42]Do it again, do it again, do it again.
[43:11.46]It's like the blob from fuckin' Clay Fire.
[43:17.72]Oh my god, do it again!
[43:23.97]Just don't, don't even dodge.
[43:24.99]Just jump o- wait till he jumps over you.
[43:26.47]When he does the face thing, that's when you wanna do the dash.
[43:30.41]Holy shit, that's... I didn't even do it either.
[43:33.13]I just didn't do it.
[43:33.91]You gotta keep your distance with this guy.
[43:42.82]God damn it.
[43:45.02]I'm getting too cocky with this shit.
[43:46.42]Slow it down.
[43:54.11]Can you parry enemies?
[43:55.35]Like, block?
[43:55.83]What's he doing?
[43:58.25]Wait.
[43:59.85]Oh, shit.
[44:00.33]Okay, hold on.
[44:00.89]Oh, okay.
[44:01.51]Well, now I know I can... Woo!
[44:07.15]What's that?
[44:10.69]Oh, my god.
[44:11.41]Oh, my god.
[44:13.63]It's too much.
[44:15.02]He turned into a fucking balloon.
[44:17.26]Violet, you're turning violet, Violet!
[44:24.84]What?
[44:25.20]I dashed.
[44:26.08]Give me a break.
[44:28.88]I'm dead.
[44:31.05]I got close.
[44:34.17]I got close.
[44:34.69]I got close.
[44:36.45]I was good that close.
[44:48.90]Get right up his ass.
[44:49.72]You know what I mean?
[44:58.17]I gotta parry those three question marks.
[45:00.05]I'll get it.
[45:05.19]Bring it on.
[45:05.69]Here it comes.
[45:06.75]Got it.
[45:07.59]I got a super here.
[45:08.67]I'm gonna use it right now.
[45:25.97]Ouchies!
[45:32.45]Wow!
[45:33.37]Wow!
[45:34.75]Wow!
[45:36.27]Wow!
[45:43.76]I'm in love with this game, by the way.
[45:45.74]I wonder if he does that again.
[45:52.35]Oh my god, pay attention.
[45:53.33]What am I doing?
[45:54.75]Oh my god, what am I thinking?
[46:01.24]What's he doing?
[46:01.60]I don't know.
[46:03.28]I think he's dead.
[46:05.76]He's dead, right?
[46:07.10]Oh, he's not dead.
[46:07.84]Wait, what is this?
[46:08.72]Oh my god, dude.
[46:13.53]You just don't get hit by them when he does the chomp thing from Mario 64.
[46:17.33]Here I come.
[46:26.46]Whoa!
[46:29.48]Don't do it again, don't do it again.
[46:30.77]Just die.
[46:31.85]Got it.
[46:36.89]The chomp, the thwomp, whatever his name is.
[46:40.57]Loud!
[46:45.80]I'm gonna try to save your guys' ears as much as I can.
[46:49.54]What'd I get?
[46:50.00]A?
[46:51.14]A-.
[46:51.28]I'm okay with that.
[46:51.91]I'm alright with an A-.
[47:00.75]This game is so fucking intense.
[47:03.74]It's just- it's just fun.
[47:09.58]It's just a fun game.
[47:12.05]It's not loud for us.
[47:12.83]It's because every time that comes up, I'm moving over to my OBS and draining the audio bar.
[47:20.09]I'm trying to help you guys.
[47:20.87]Alright, how many coins do I have?
[47:21.71]I need more coins.
[47:26.30]What's up here?
[47:27.02]Alright, I need a new voice.
[47:30.84]This guy's a kind of a dweeb, it seems.
[47:33.92]What's that?
[47:34.62]You two want to fly in a plane like I do?
[47:37.02]Ha!
[47:38.08]You're not sitting in any cockpit till you study those blueprints.
[47:43.95]That was like a four out of ten, boys.
[47:45.93]Airplane blueprint.
[47:52.12]Shoot.
[47:52.50]Hold for rapid fire.
[47:53.50]Be special.
[47:54.20]One meter.
[47:54.66]EX attack.
[47:55.20]Full meter.
[47:55.62]Super bomb morph.
[47:59.44]Parry.
[47:59.94]Yeah.
[48:00.89]Shrink.
[48:03.61]Hold to reduce size and increase speed.
[48:05.69]Equipped with mini bullets.
[48:06.79]What the fuck?
[48:12.98]It's kind of hard to do that and shoot.
[48:19.44]So that's... Okay, it's a parry.
[48:21.37]Everything else is pretty normal.
[48:22.47]Okay.
[48:23.87]I gotta do a plane level now?
[48:31.91]Okay.
[48:32.39]Well, let's try it.
[48:37.19]Threatening Zeppelin.
[48:45.32]Oh, it's the person from Steven Universe!
[48:48.32]Restart.
[48:48.92]Fucking idiot.
[48:55.75]What's her name?
[48:56.47]Olivia from Steven Universe!
[49:01.73]Whoa!
[49:03.63]Oh, you gotta be little.
[49:04.67]You have to go mini.
[49:09.45]Whoa!
[49:10.13]I didn't know you do that.
[49:21.88]This is a cool boss.
[49:22.98]Can I super?
[49:24.64]What do you think?
[49:29.68]Yeah.
[49:30.08]Whoa!
[49:30.20]Is that what I wanted to do?
[49:32.06]I think so.
[49:32.46]Alright, is that constellation going to hurt me?
[49:40.96]I'm scared of the constellation.
[49:42.10]Like, whatever he does.
[49:42.68]He's gonna shoot this arrow!
[49:48.64]It's all about transitioning.
[49:51.15]You gotta transition into the little guy more often than you think.
[49:56.25]Hello!
[50:00.63]What is that?
[50:02.72]It's a tornado!
[50:09.30]Auntie Em!
[50:09.80]Auntie Em!
[50:10.72]It's a twister!
[50:12.49]What is that from?
[50:19.13]Holy shit.
[50:23.01]Holy shit.
[50:25.79]This is fucking crazy.
[50:31.77]Ah, damn it.
[50:32.37]I'm in trouble.
[50:35.21]I didn't know they shoot the beams out.
[50:42.76]Oh, look at how close I was.
[50:43.92]Fuck, that was so close.
[50:45.10]Alright, this one isn't that bad.
[50:52.58]Don't get cocky.
[50:56.46]Make sure I'm changing.
[50:57.26]Watch out for the ball.
[51:04.22]The ball fucked me up last time.
[51:05.37]Don't let it fuck you up again.
[51:13.26]That moon shit, man, that's, that was awesome.
[51:17.54]Like, we're talking, that was like a 10 out of 10.
[51:19.38]Like, fucking stop talking!
[51:21.26]Stop talking, stop gushing about the game and beat it!
[51:23.73]I'm sitting here like, you know, it's a 10 out of 10 game, and I might as well not pay attention to it while I play the fucking thing.
[51:33.99]Oh, goddammit, I might as well just end it.
[51:38.25]I'm too busy tilting myself because I'm talking about... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:44.73]I haven't even seen Cupid yet.
[51:46.97]I can't get hit one time.
[51:48.63]Yeah, just the agonist dog.
[51:50.50]Everybody just let me... Everybody just let me shut up.
[51:54.22]Everybody just tell me to shut up.
[51:55.46]Say it right now.
[51:56.42]I want to see it.
[51:56.90]Say, Jeremy, shut up.
[51:58.72]Because I'm... Okay.
[52:07.10]I love that horn.
[52:19.45]I'm good.
[52:26.07]Watch out for the twisters.
[52:28.77]She has a tendency to shoot out a twister.
[52:33.00]Oh, you fucking dumb idiot.
[52:43.23]Get out of my face First try last time I'm fucking tilted I almost beat it first try
[53:11.90]There she goes.
[53:17.62]Alright, get it right.
[53:18.48]Turns into the goat.
[53:22.96]Come on, you fucking dummy.
[53:35.50]Holy fuck, what the hell was I doing?
[53:42.41]I'm not gonna super.
[53:46.74]I'm gonna hold it.
[53:47.92]I'm gonna hold it for Cupid.
[53:53.85]Cupid needs that super.
[53:55.79]Nobody else.
[53:57.89]Because I'm invincible right now.
[53:59.15]I'm gonna skip to the moon.
[54:09.88]Here we go.
[54:10.45]Oh, come on.
[54:10.97]That was bullshit.
[54:11.61]Will these things go away?
[54:22.40]Here we go.
[54:25.50]Turn into the moon.
[54:26.54]Now just pay attention to where the ships are.
[54:35.90]Oh, God damn it.
[54:38.73]I haven't been parrying anything.
[54:43.79]Whoa!
[54:44.15]D'oh!
[55:04.43]No!
[55:05.95]No!
[55:07.23]No!
[55:09.09]Oh, fuck!
[55:15.88]God damn it!
[55:18.28]Oh my god!
[55:19.56]It's that fucking stupid... It's the stupid spaceships!
[55:24.77]I would have won in one second!
[55:33.42]God damn it.
[55:35.23]I'll get it this time.
[55:36.03]No more fucking around.
[55:43.05]Anything pink I can parry.
[55:44.39]I don't know why I keep forgetting that.
[55:53.53]Alright.
[55:54.59]Super when he gets to Cupid.
[55:59.38]Bring it back.
[56:04.64]Here we go.
[56:11.02]I gotta hit them.
[56:11.96]Alright, slow down.
[56:18.20]We're good.
[56:19.01]Here we go.
[56:23.79]Bring it home.
[56:24.59]Give me the moon.
[56:31.03]Fuck.
[56:31.77]Damn it!
[56:36.04]Fuck me!
[56:36.64]Shit!
[57:09.93]Oh, thank God!
[57:14.57]What?
[57:14.87]Oh my, what happened?
[57:20.17]Did I?
[57:21.05]Huh?
[57:25.84]I actually still made it.
[57:28.68]I got a B. Once the knockout happens, you're invincible.
[57:37.18]Wow.
[57:41.52]That was close.
[57:42.52]Come on, it's a B-grade.
[57:45.88]This game is fucking fantastic.
[57:51.51]It's not loud for us?
[57:52.63]Really?
[57:52.95]Alright, well I won't do it anymore.
[57:58.35]Oh boy, that was fucking... That was fun.
[57:59.99]I need more coins.
[58:04.78]This is another level.
[58:05.78]This is another coin level.
[58:11.34]What are you looking at?
[58:11.86]My chip?
[58:12.50]Ha!
[58:13.34]It's not my fault.
[58:14.10]I've been busy fighting off those casino debtors.
[58:16.30]Now I gotta save up to fix my blade.
[58:18.38]So help me.
[58:19.18]I wish someone would bust that king dice one.
[58:23.09]I just, I really, I'm really phoning this in now.
[58:25.43]I'm not, you know, I'm gonna be honest.
[58:29.69]Tree top trouble.
[58:30.63]Let's go get some, let's go get some coins.
[58:34.09]Running gun.
[58:36.91]I feel like, I feel like I want this.
[58:42.47]I wanna parry you.
[58:45.05]So people can't say that I didn't pe- Woody the Woodpecker.
[58:51.44]Can I kill him?
[58:52.34]No.
[58:55.40]I cannot kill him.
[58:57.58]Just take a look and see what the hell happens here.
[59:01.72]One more.
[59:03.96]Watch out for you, Woody the Woodpecker!
[59:11.73]Alright, I gotta parry you into there.
[59:14.31]Got it.
[59:16.03]What a cameo.
[59:19.19]Now where does he go?
[59:19.75]He goes... I can't do it.
[59:32.26]Give me another one!
[59:32.80]What the fuck?
[59:33.16]Where's the parry one?
[59:35.74]Is that my only chance to do that?
[59:41.44]I don't have no other opportunity to get this coin.
[59:43.66]What?
[59:44.34]Why?
[59:50.32]That's horseshit.
[59:52.09]No, no, I like... What the fuck is that?
[60:00.07]Fuck!
[60:00.51]God damn it!
[60:04.18]I have to get that coin.
[60:06.02]My blood will freeze if I don't.
[60:08.10]I don't even have an opportunity.
[60:11.28]Here we go.
[60:14.44]Like, literally my blood's gonna freeze if I don't get this.
[60:16.32]There we go.
[60:20.24]Now let's go.
[60:26.92]The music is so perfect too.
[60:31.46]Oh lord.
[60:33.97]New bee?
[60:34.45]A bug?
[60:40.22]Nice Ren and Stimpy character.
[60:41.34]I like it.
[60:46.14]I have enough for a super.
[60:47.50]I should probably just use it here.
[60:52.74]Very good.
[60:56.40]My blood's gonna freeze.
[60:57.44]It will.
[61:01.80]Coin.
[61:03.14]Wow, what the fuck?
[61:04.32]Can I not, like, aim at you, buddy?
[61:10.79]What else do I want to buy?
[61:12.39]I feel like there's a lot of cool options in this game.
[61:17.94]Thank God he walked into that.
[61:18.94]I would not have been a happy camper.
[61:30.93]Mm-hmm.
[61:33.15]What do I do with you?
[61:35.01]What do I do with you?
[61:39.17]Oh, fuck.
[61:39.71]Okay.
[61:41.39]Oh, no.
[61:42.43]Okay, he comes back.
[61:43.05]Thank God.
[61:52.15]Wait, watch.
[61:52.65]Where's the coin?
[61:53.85]Where's the coin?
[61:54.57]There's gonna be a coin, like, right here.
[62:00.53]Wow, that was almost bad.
[62:04.26]Well, they shoot up, don't they?
[62:06.97]Oh, fuck.
[62:08.77]Fuck, no.
[62:09.61]No, no, no, no.
[62:10.47]Get there.
[62:13.63]Ah!
[62:17.32]These don't fall.
[62:18.06]They do fall.
[62:18.62]Does this guy have to die?
[62:21.30]Oh my god!
[62:24.08]This guy's gotta die right now!
[62:26.10]This guy's gotta die right now!
[62:27.62]Fuck!
[62:38.46]Right at the very fucking end of the level.
[62:40.64]Right at the very end of the level, dude.
[62:42.79]God damn it.
[62:47.21]Oh, well.
[62:51.19]That's unfortunate.
[62:54.10]At least I got the coins.
[62:56.82]I'm glad they don't take... No, they don't.
[62:59.74]They do... They do take them away from you.
[63:01.80]It's not a permanent thing.
[63:05.02]Well, that just fucking soils my soul.
[63:13.45]Okay, well, that almost was a disaster.
[63:17.39]That didn't happen last time.
[63:27.06]Harder than Demon's Souls.
[63:28.94]Well, it's a different kind of difficult.
[63:31.35]It's like a Twitch difficult.
[63:34.05]No, not the TV kind.
[63:35.69]I'm talking like Twitch.
[63:37.27]You gotta Twitch around.
[63:39.14]Oh, I missed that one.
[63:45.96]Die.
[63:58.63]Alright, let's get back there.
[64:00.19]Let me get the angle.
[64:01.13]Let me get the fucking speedrun angle.
[64:05.73]Nope.
[64:13.58]Just die!
[64:15.98]Die, you piece of shit!
[64:22.36]You know, speaking of speedruns, I can't wait to see the speedruns for this game.
[64:27.65]You know that some people are gonna have crazy shit that they're doing.
[64:32.51]It's gonna be cool.
[64:33.51]Alright, now this time, don't fuck this whole thing up.
[64:36.63]There I am.
[64:40.74]Full health.
[64:42.88]Full everything.
[64:48.28]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[64:50.68]Wow.
[64:51.16]Okay.
[64:51.64]Well... I didn't think it goes through them.
[64:56.45]I didn't realize it went through them.
[64:57.75]I thought it just hit them.
[64:58.51]Whoops-a-daisy.
[65:04.65]What the hell was that bounce?
[65:10.41]Almost a disaster.
[65:11.59]Close.
[65:17.05]Okay, don't fuck this up.
[65:21.48]Almost fucked it up.
[65:22.24]Okay, just go here first.
[65:24.08]I'm gonna fucking smash this guy.
[65:25.46]Second he comes in, bang.
[65:30.16]Get the fuck out of here.
[65:31.62]It's coming for me.
[65:35.57]Oh!
[65:46.18]That's Homer Simpson impression.
[66:01.39]Did I get all the coins?
[66:02.19]Three!
[66:05.13]No more than three minutes!
[66:08.00]I got all the coins.
[66:08.60]That's all I care about.
[66:11.44]B?
[66:12.52]I'm good.
[66:13.10]I'm good with a B. Why did you turn it down again?
[66:23.90]Because I'm paranoid!
[66:25.00]I got seven coins.
[66:28.36]Let's wrap it down here.
[66:33.73]What can I buy now?
[66:37.69]Stop turning it down.
[66:38.87]Welcome.
[66:39.79]Welcome.
[66:41.22]Chaos.
[66:42.06]Okay, EX, that's okay.
[66:43.22]A long range with below average damage, no aiming required.
[66:46.72]An extra hit point.
[66:49.36]I don't know, but like, makes me weaker?
[66:53.13]That's the trait, I don't like that trade-off.
[66:56.03]Because if I'm getting hit, it's going to extend the amount of time I have to be in the level anyways, because it's making me do less damage.
[67:04.35]Hmm.
[67:05.93]Automatic parry, the first parry move is automatic, all you need to do is jump.
[67:14.22]Extra HP seems pretty... Yeah, but I mean, it's like... I mean, it's huge when you get three, but that means I have to stay in the boss fights longer.
[67:26.43]Lobber.
[67:26.83]Medium range and good damage with a little slower rate of fire.
[67:29.01]Actually, it's a scam.
[67:35.68]Well, uh... Does the automatic parry happen only to pink things?
[67:43.21]Or does that happen to... everything?
[67:47.28]Like, if I get hit by something, will it parry it?
[67:52.90]Jumbo Roundabout.
[67:53.62]What's it?
[67:54.08]You know, I'm going to try this.
[67:56.04]This one seems pretty cool.
[68:02.39]Go Glass Cannon.
[68:03.17]I mean, I feel like I want to.
[68:04.63]I'm going to go, like, Glass Cannon.
[68:07.39]I want to try this.
[68:12.85]I want to try this one out.
[68:16.21]Can only parry pink, yeah.
[68:17.65]Let's try this.
[68:20.63]So I have super art, smoke bomb, because this replaces the spread.
[68:27.25]So this is just long range.
[68:29.03]Wait, hold on.
[68:29.51]Are you serious?
[68:38.58]It's hard to believe this game was made in the 40s.
[68:43.62]So do I even need to take?
[68:47.13]Yeah, I'm going to do this.
[68:49.21]Why even have the regular shot?
[68:50.89]Let's just try it.
[68:51.45]I want to give it a try.
[68:55.01]Curious.
[68:56.01]Alright, so we've been up here, we've been down there.
[69:00.52]Can you guys believe this game was made in 1941?
[69:01.88]Or like 1932?
[69:02.22]We already did that.
[69:04.12]Let's go down here.
[69:13.06]Alright, there we go.
[69:14.80]Floral Fury.
[69:17.28]Floral Fury.
[69:20.16]Flower.
[69:25.26]Oh, boy.
[69:27.87]That's ridiculous.
[69:30.35]Does this do, like, no damage, though?
[69:31.63]I feel like this is... Okay, well, you can get hurt by these.
[69:34.31]No, that's shit coming out of the ground.
[69:39.03]Okay.
[69:42.59]There's two planes here.
[69:44.01]I can parry the pink one.
[69:48.25]That's... I don't like this.
[69:54.10]I don't like the homing.
[69:55.82]It's less involved.
[69:58.44]I feel like I'm paying less attention to everything that's going on.
[70:09.17]He gets his face.
[70:12.81]He can't kill that brain.
[70:17.11]And the acorns.
[70:27.36]Not so bad.
[70:29.70]What's that?
[70:30.24]I don't know.
[70:31.10]It's a boomerang.
[70:33.34]Wow!
[70:33.72]A boomerang's comeback, Jeremy.
[70:36.08]I'm not sure you know this.
[70:44.70]Boomerangs do come back.
[70:45.89]Ow.
[70:49.35]Wow, what in the name of God was I doing?
[70:54.63]I don't know what the hell I was doing there.
[71:06.74]Oh, God.
[71:08.28]Get off the ground, you fucking idiot.
[71:11.36]You're out.
[71:18.67]That's alright.
[71:28.44]It's all about them coming out of the ground.
[71:30.56]Ah!
[71:36.64]Ah!
[71:38.42]Fuck!
[71:44.32]No, no, get- no, no, no, no, no.
[71:45.85]Get- hold on.
[71:50.95]Get the fucking- I don't like the homing missile.
[71:53.97]It makes me way- it makes me way too complacent.
[71:56.21]It does.
[71:57.58]It makes me like, I can just stand here.
[71:58.90]Who cares?
[71:59.66]No, I don't want it.
[72:02.94]I don't want it.
[72:08.06]It makes me less involved and I get like catatonic.
[72:16.63]Bring it on.
[72:32.11]You gotta keep your eye on the fucking game here, man.
[72:39.65]I like the music.
[72:44.24]Boomerang.
[72:45.62]Comes back.
[72:52.34]I didn't want to do that.
[72:57.12]Boomerang?
[72:57.54]Nope.
[72:57.96]No Boomerang.
[73:00.12]Shit.
[73:00.42]That was an unwinnable situation for me.
[73:07.45]Damn it!
[73:08.55]Ah, that went so much faster.
[73:09.73]Fuck!
[73:10.71]These projectiles are fucking me in the face!
[73:27.97]Damn it.
[73:31.09]This is fucking killing me.
[73:33.35]Oh, it's just everything moves so awkwardly in this fight.
[73:36.98]It's so slow and some of them move fast.
[73:40.52]Can you get him?
[73:41.00]Okay, I wanted to... I'm staying back here.
[73:49.46]We're gonna try this strat.
[73:55.81]I'm staying in the back.
[74:02.25]Oh, god.
[74:02.79]Fucking... Damn it!
[74:04.29]Oh, god!
[74:05.39]This one's gonna... I'm gonna be here for two hours.
[74:10.98]Things gotta move fast for me.
[74:12.12]No, just do the way I was doing it.
[74:13.36]I'm doing my own strat.
[74:20.19]I gotta dodge more.
[74:21.19]I have it.
[74:21.79]Like, use it.
[74:31.47]I didn't even see that thing.
[74:33.70]Holy shit, I did not... We're good.
[74:40.98]See when he does shit like that?
[74:42.08]What the fuck?
[74:42.50]Fuck you, buddy.
[75:06.97]Yeah, here comes the butterfly.
[75:08.73]Which way is it coming back?
[75:09.77]There we go.
[75:10.27]Good.
[75:10.49]Alright, this is what fucks me up every time.
[75:13.30]Careful.
[75:20.30]All the projectiles.
[75:21.28]There's too many of them.
[75:26.42]Oh, fuck.
[75:27.34]Jesus Christ.
[75:31.68]He's doing this shit again.
[75:40.29]Oh, two came out of it!
[75:41.93]Two came out of that one!
[75:43.55]Two!
[75:47.52]Two came out of that one?
[75:48.70]What?
[75:49.18]Oh my lord and fucking heaven and sacred hell.
[75:53.70]Fuck me.
[75:54.90]This part sucks.
[75:56.90]They go fucking everywhere.
[76:03.86]Two fucking popped out of that one.
[76:05.10]That's never happened before.
[76:10.81]You get stuck in that shit.
[76:11.79]Fuck you.
[76:19.55]And the brain comes out.
[76:22.11]Come on, do it.
[76:24.96]Fuck.
[76:26.72]I hate this one.
[76:27.82]I'm gonna have to come back to this one.
[76:29.32]This one is horrendous.
[76:41.79]I'm not even close.
[76:42.49]I'm not even halfway.
[76:43.47]I hate when he does this thing.
[76:47.75]Don't do it, please!
[76:54.12]I almost have to wait until all the animations are done.
[77:01.70]Open your mouth.
[77:05.48]No!
[77:06.04]No!
[77:06.72]I just got done with you!
[77:13.45]God, it's just too much stuff gets on the screen!
[77:18.83]What happens is like too much animations are on the screen and I can't even- Oh man.
[77:25.38]I'm gonna do this one more time.
[77:28.52]I'm looking at chat over here.
[77:35.97]Oh, that's painful.
[77:40.25]Extra life seems pretty nice.
[77:41.33]Yeah, actually I might do that.
[77:45.93]I need to like parry this one.
[77:47.29]I got- okay.
[77:48.55]Give me a fucking break.
[77:50.53]Shit's not even on the screen and I get hit by it.
[77:55.44]So what- you- you have to parry one of those that comes down.
[77:57.82]You have to.
[77:58.78]Otherwise it's not gonna happen.
[78:07.54]Jesus fucking Christ.
[78:11.09]It's this thing!
[78:11.87]If this thing wasn't here, why don't you- why don't you get out of here?
[78:18.04]You overcomplicate this thing, you stupid flying brain!
[78:26.68]Don't come back this way.
[78:27.65]Good.
[78:28.29]Give me like a good few hits on him.
[78:35.07]Let me step back.
[78:36.33]I got a parry one.
[78:37.55]Have to.
[78:38.15]Have to, have to, have to.
[78:39.61]He's like stuck.
[78:40.59]He's broken.
[78:40.93]The boss is broken.
[78:41.57]I win.
[78:43.05]I think the boss broke.
[78:44.70]Good.
[78:44.96]Who cares?
[78:47.36]Good.
[78:48.32]I win.
[78:51.42]What's he doing?
[78:51.92]I don't... Oh my god.
[78:55.70]No!
[78:59.33]No!
[79:04.14]I don't know what he does in this.
[79:05.13]Let me win because the game broke.
[79:08.07]Oh.
[79:12.99]Die.
[79:14.20]Die.
[79:15.24]Die.
[79:15.52]Which way is it going?
[79:36.96]No, it was so easy they gave it to me for free they gave it to me and I'm like I'm all fucked up oh They gave it to me for free.
[79:45.52]I threw it away.
[79:46.17]I threw it in the trash can oh
[79:51.90]Dammit.
[79:54.96]Ayayayayay.
[79:57.66]And what is that noise?
[79:59.64]What is that horrible noise that won't stop?
[80:04.74]I know what he does now.
[80:05.52]Alright, I got it.
[80:06.54]I'm fucking winning.
[80:09.82]It goes down to the bottom every time.
[80:12.96]This is not even easy.
[80:14.40]It's not even hard.
[80:16.09]Just fucking beat it, Jeremy.
[80:17.31]You can do this.
[80:18.49]I've seen you do it.
[80:19.23]It just goes to the bottom.
[80:20.21]And I thought it was random.
[80:25.64]Where's the pink one?
[80:28.46]And I'm fucking off the damn screen.
[80:30.30]Off the screen I get hit.
[80:31.66]Oh, that should never be a thing.
[80:32.62]What is this, Super Smash Brothers?
[80:33.68]My percentage shouldn't go up.
[80:35.02]This is fucking Super Smash Brothers level of bullshit.
[80:49.83]Here we go.
[80:52.93]Hey!
[80:59.11]I wasn't paying any attention!
[81:25.21]Okay, we win.
[81:37.22]Did I get a D?
[81:41.01]I got a B. That was intense.
[81:47.05]That was fun.
[81:47.93]I love this game.
[81:53.13]I don't deserve these pogchats.
[81:56.10]I didn't turn it down.
[81:59.20]Cagney Carnation.
[82:04.94]Thank you, Chessmaster91 for the 10 bucks.
[82:08.09]I would have loved to get these bits by watching ads, but I jokingly said I was 65 year old woman when I registered the account.
[82:14.65]Spoiler, I'm not.
[82:16.11]By the way, it's Cheesemaster.
[82:17.29]It's Chessmaster.
[82:20.49]Thank you.
[82:21.27]Thank you, Cheesemaster for the 10 bucks.
[82:25.27]Party Crabs, thanks for the 8 bucks.
[82:29.21]Jerma just wanted to let you know, if you ever play Destiny 2, there's a gun called the Death Adder and another called the Rat King.
[82:37.83]The Brat King gun.
[82:40.12]Everyone has to get that gun.
[82:42.08]Otherwise, you can't play Destiny 2.
[82:43.78]But thank you, PartyCrafts.
[82:45.84]Corvid, thanks for the one buck.
[82:48.75]The video game Voice Actor Strike ended on the 23rd.
[82:53.93]And then on the 29th, this stream.
[82:56.69]Oh, I get your joke.
[82:58.27]Thank you.
[82:59.21]Also, thank you to Axel Hurdle for the $5.
[83:01.69]I'm actually impressed with how well you're playing.
[83:03.58]Glad to see you enjoying the game.
[83:05.56]Oh, it's great.
[83:06.74]Highly recommend it so far.
[83:09.04]Thank you for the $5.
[83:12.82]Let's move.
[83:13.98]Thank you, everybody.
[83:17.98]There's some dice here.
[83:18.68]Is this the casino?
[83:20.63]The die house.
[83:24.76]I'm not impressed.
[83:27.96]This guy's going to have a, yeah, right?
[83:29.56]Like a, no, it ain't that a bit.
[83:33.09]I'm Mr. King Dice.
[83:34.85]I'm the gamest in the land.
[83:37.13]We've got to listen to this person.
[83:38.75]I never play nice.
[83:40.07]I'm the devil's right-hand man.
[83:44.18]I can't let you pass because you ain't done everything.
[83:48.92]Bring me those contracts.
[83:51.40]Come on, bring them to the king.
[83:56.45]Okay.
[83:57.63]So he's like the... Can I... That sounds... So if I go backwards, am I going to be able to come back here?
[84:09.44]Or is this kind of the... I think I've done everything, so it doesn't matter.
[84:17.32]Soundtrack fucking rules.
[84:18.26]Yeah, if you like the soundtrack... Wow, this is awesome.
[84:25.27]Oh, boy.
[84:25.77]This just reminds me of, like, Disney World.
[84:32.25]These guys seriously outdid themselves.
[84:33.79]They really did.
[84:34.83]This is all so interesting.
[84:36.55]Everything about this is cool.
[84:41.54]It's the carnival.
[84:42.60]Let's talk to these guys.
[84:44.94]Whoever heard of a barbershop trio?
[84:47.50]If we can't find our fourth member, we'll never sound right again.
[84:50.22]Be a pal and let us know if you spot him, won't you?
[84:56.91]Okay.
[84:58.38]It's a pyramid.
[84:59.48]Midway mystery is this guy again.
[85:02.84]Good timing, fellas.
[85:04.04]I just added an upgrade to your aeroplanes.
[85:06.52]Now you can wallop your foes with bombs.
[85:08.88]Just switch your weapon whenever it strikes your fancy.
[85:11.24]Try it out.
[85:13.11]Your aeroplanes are now equipped with mini-bombs.
[85:14.73]Switch your weapon any time during battle.
[85:17.39]Cool.
[85:19.41]Can't go this way yet.
[85:20.39]What's in the lollipop house?
[85:22.29]Sugarland Shimmy.
[85:24.61]Baroness Bon Bon Bon.
[85:28.94]Let's go.
[85:31.04]Oh, wow.
[85:34.26]That was... She just gets, like, jawbreakers.
[85:37.86]I remember jawbreak... Did you hurt the guy on the bottom?
[85:43.64]No.
[85:46.67]It's just Pac-Man endlessly.
[85:47.91]It's just cracked... It's fucking cracked out Pac-Man trying to eat the one pellet that he can't get to.
[85:56.80]You get the whole thing.
[85:58.44]Oh, that is... Oh, this is fucking crazy.
[86:04.64]This is absolutely crazy.
[86:06.02]I love it.
[86:07.30]I fucking love it.
[86:08.88]This is everything I ever wanted in this game.
[86:12.18]Wow, it doesn't... Alright, they come out randomly.
[86:19.67]I thought that was going to be one at a time.
[86:20.83]I guess it's a bunch of random encounters that depends on what you get.
[86:24.37]I can just see the speedrunners now complaining.
[86:26.82]Fuck man, I got the worst RNG, I got cube guy like twice in a row!
[86:33.16]Waffle?
[86:38.77]Ow.
[86:39.95]Whew!
[86:45.77]Kinda just want to be able to see all the guys, you know?
[86:57.99]I'm dead.
[86:58.31]Yep.
[87:00.25]It's about halfway.
[87:04.57]I got cube guy again.
[87:07.15]I like this one.
[87:09.41]This is good.
[87:14.05]They try to... Okay, that's cool.
[87:15.55]I like it.
[87:18.15]They try to fuck with your ability to do that.
[87:34.32]Break, break, break, break, break, break, break, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[87:41.99]Alright, candy guy.
[87:43.95]This guy's not that bad.
[87:48.19]Watch out for the peanuts.
[87:51.05]The little peanuts that come out, you don't want to get hit by them.
[87:55.65]Watch out for the, like, plankton.
[87:59.90]Curse you!
[88:02.25]Waffle?
[88:02.71]Yep.
[88:02.89]Alright, waffle I'm gonna- waffle's kinda hard.
[88:05.81]How hard does that come out?
[88:07.99]Not that hard.
[88:10.71]She has- oh, she has a shotgun that she shoots.
[88:16.13]She's sick of my shit, it seems.
[88:27.22]What's next?
[88:27.58]Anything?
[88:28.10]Just her?
[88:31.29]She's angry.
[88:31.87]What's she gonna do?
[88:32.55]Oh, that thing has a mouth now.
[88:34.19]Whoa!
[88:34.95]The fucking level moves!
[88:36.89]Wow!
[88:37.57]Does that not even hit her?
[88:42.96]I don't think I even hit her.
[88:43.70]Wow!
[88:50.72]Jesus Christ!
[89:00.84]I can't kill those.
[89:10.30]Fuck!
[89:13.47]Wow!
[89:15.55]Can I parry the peppermint?
[89:16.53]I don't know, that's a good idea.
[89:22.97]There was more after that.
[89:26.80]Alright, well, these aren't too bad.
[89:27.68]Now, once you, like, memorize these things, they're actually pretty easy.
[89:30.08]I wonder if I should try to... Maybe, like, don't even get on the platform.
[89:36.75]I'm not sure.
[89:40.65]Like, parry the head?
[89:45.39]It just wasn't, like, that pink.
[89:47.60]Maybe.
[89:51.42]I almost just got so fucked there!
[89:55.09]Fuck.
[89:56.71]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[89:57.61]I can't take damage there.
[89:59.57]Carry the house.
[90:03.42]Oh, this I haven't seen.
[90:04.64]God damn it.
[90:05.18]Let me just see what the hell this guy is.
[90:07.14]Okay, well that lasts a long time.
[90:10.06]I get it.
[90:16.35]I get it.
[90:16.77]I think that's all he does.
[90:21.28]I'm gonna restart it anyways, y'all.
[90:23.82]Yeah, let's restart it.
[90:26.68]Can I read the jelly bean?
[90:27.76]I know.
[90:30.50]I know.
[90:30.90]Alright, time to quiet down.
[90:46.31]Come at me.
[90:50.31]Crack it.
[90:51.35]Crack the egg.
[90:52.96]Come on, give me good RNG.
[90:55.66]I hate this guy.
[90:59.78]I don't like how far that moves.
[91:05.36]What the fuck was that?
[91:06.26]God damn it!
[91:07.02]That was the stupid thing of the stupid pickle people!
[91:10.20]The fucking dumb pickle plankton assholes!
[91:12.62]And I just... Come on!
[91:15.18]I'm losing here.
[91:23.73]Fucking pickle people.
[91:29.07]This is new.
[91:29.45]You're giving me too many new enemies!
[91:42.13]How many different encounters are there here?
[91:59.74]Well, at least I got to see them all probably.
[92:02.84]This one's the easiest guy.
[92:03.88]Give me this one like three, five times.
[92:07.10]I have an itch on the back of my head and I can't scratch it.
[92:14.10]I'd consider that guy bad RNG, yeah.
[92:17.20]Now my whole head is itchy.
[92:23.14]You know when you play a game like this, man, and once something starts to itch, your whole body does.
[92:29.87]That's all I can focus on now.
[92:33.61]This guy sucks.
[92:46.40]Die, come on.
[92:48.24]Come on.
[92:48.60]Pickle, pickle, pickle, pickle.
[92:54.91]Fuck you.
[92:55.71]Really?
[92:56.25]Fuck off.
[92:57.43]I fucking hate that one.
[92:58.73]That one sucks.
[93:02.94]Why am I getting this guy again?
[93:16.95]Shit.
[93:17.35]I'm in trouble.
[93:19.29]I might get to the next phase.
[93:24.19]No, I'm not.
[93:30.41]Ugh.
[93:30.67]Ugh.
[93:32.39]Fine.
[93:32.77]Start with this guy.
[93:33.61]Good.
[93:38.94]Dear lord.
[93:39.68]Wait.
[93:40.14]Again.
[93:40.58]I get it again.
[93:47.01]Bring back the waffle.
[93:54.99]Oh, I can't handle the fucking cupcake.
[93:56.81]I just can't.
[93:57.83]I cannot fucking handle the cupcake.
[93:59.61]It's too fucking weird for me.
[94:00.93]Give me... No.
[94:01.79]Just shut up, Jeremy.
[94:02.87]Calm down.
[94:06.86]Either calm down or don't even... Eat shit, Jeremy.
[94:11.84]Right?
[94:21.71]God, I pray for the waffle every time.
[94:24.61]And the candy cane guy.
[94:26.07]No, the bubblegum guy.
[94:28.02]No, not this fucking guy.
[94:34.18]I'm just gonna sit in one spot.
[94:37.50]I'm not gonna overcomplicate it.
[94:41.29]This guy's not that bad.
[94:42.15]I'm just moving around like a psycho.
[94:47.39]Just not the muffin man.
[94:48.43]Anything but the muffin man.
[94:53.80]Okay.
[94:55.28]Give me the gumball.
[94:56.68]Give me the gumball machine.
[94:58.82]Okay, I'll take this.
[94:59.40]Quiet.
[94:59.82]Quiet, Jeremy.
[95:00.30]Quiet.
[95:03.23]Okay.
[95:26.47]Here we go.
[95:29.50]Let's be easy here.
[95:31.72]Can I parry her head?
[95:35.64]No, you can't.
[95:40.08]I don't think you can do anything to the head.
[95:59.07]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[96:01.21]Woo!
[96:01.41]Alright.
[96:28.02]Let's go.
[96:28.46]B minus streamer.
[96:31.58]I thought that was gonna be... I thought I did too.
[96:38.86]I was about to say that's the hardest one.
[96:41.22]That was insane.
[96:45.92]So, okay, here's my assessment so far.
[96:49.54]So far... Everything is very difficult.
[96:55.85]But it's fair.
[96:59.03]That, meh, that, okay, that last... stage right there.
[97:04.35]That head, that movement of the head, it was really like a Warcraft NPC.
[97:08.47]Just like, I go this way.
[97:09.67]That way.
[97:10.59]I'm gonna go this way now.
[97:11.75]I'm gonna, like, that was erratic and that was hard to deal with.
[97:14.44]That's just pure RNG, the whole thing.
[97:17.80]That was like the RNG... fight.
[97:21.64]Because how the hell are you supposed to even memorize anything?
[97:27.68]Tough but fair.
[97:31.67]Just like Dark Souls.
[97:32.99]How is that RNG?
[97:33.83]Like the head, the movement of the head is just random.
[97:41.68]That's what it is.
[97:42.24]It's our radioactive nuclear game.
[97:48.20]It's a... Switch weapon.
[97:53.76]Alright, so just like in the old school video games, you can still shrink.
[97:57.68]Okay.
[98:01.47]Watch out for the Sphinx.
[98:02.49]There's a lot of cats.
[98:04.13]Okay.
[98:05.49]How do I get rid of the cats?
[98:07.61]Can I?
[98:19.21]And... Tick-tock.
[98:20.46]Oh.
[98:21.88]I forgot that's what that did.
[98:22.82]I'm gonna stay small for this one.
[98:29.48]What?
[98:30.28]Oh!
[98:30.58]You're gonna hit the faces.
[98:31.54]Okay, hit the faces.
[98:32.94]Oh, boy.
[98:33.78]Oh, dad.
[98:38.97]Alrighty.
[98:44.33]I was trying to dodge that before.
[98:45.91]The, uh... That cloud.
[98:49.91]You don't need to dodge the cloud.
[98:51.42]I was trying to.
[98:52.08]It's just there for show.
[98:56.00]It's there to make you say, wow, cool.
[98:57.48]Alright, shoot the faces.
[99:05.46]Oh, wow.
[99:06.82]It hurts when you touch.
[99:07.70]Die!
[99:09.32]Is it just a saw blade or is it a stick too?
[99:11.26]Is it the stick?
[99:12.10]It's not the stick.
[99:18.73]Fucking Flappy Bird!
[99:23.41]Oh, I was never any good, Flappy Bird.
[99:25.39]I'm not gonna do this one.
[99:27.41]I was terrible at Flappy Bird.
[99:44.68]I'll get it.
[99:46.72]What's in the box?
[99:47.61]Oh, I just fucked myself, thank god.
[99:51.03]Wow, it's still flying around!
[99:52.31]I hit that.
[100:05.04]April is surely brewing.
[100:07.44]Here goes.
[100:10.97]Okay, here we go.
[100:14.18]Cats!
[100:22.48]Cats are the best.
[100:23.64]You want to get the cats.
[100:24.94]Every time.
[100:29.42]Okay.
[100:30.74]Hit the faces.
[100:31.52]Don't.
[100:32.10]It's the saw blades.
[100:33.65]Flappy Bird.
[100:40.71]Oh, fuck.
[100:51.26]Got it.
[100:53.16]It's fucking Patrick.
[100:57.92]Oh!
[101:10.36]Not another one of these.
[101:15.73]What's he doing?
[101:17.45]The bulb?
[101:19.35]What is this doing?
[101:21.01]Oh god.
[101:21.85]There's a real boy now.
[101:24.72]Waiting for the pink one.
[101:48.49]Come on!
[101:51.05]That's gotta be... Whoa!
[101:53.43]What?
[101:53.99]What is this?
[101:55.53]Is this... Can these hurt me?
[102:06.80]Wow!
[102:11.28]I'm dead.
[102:13.30]Wow!
[102:22.89]That was fucking ridiculous.
[102:26.71]That was the luckiest fucking thing ever.
[102:37.90]That was just... That last hit... Holy shit.
[102:44.26]That's one health again.
[102:45.64]Why do I have to keep doing this to myself?
[102:48.71]I keep doing this for no reason.
[102:50.01]I keep like... It's horrible.
[102:52.45]I need to do this with like three health.
[102:58.85]Alright, what else we got?
[103:00.15]I can go through there.
[103:00.81]This trio is still here.
[103:03.13]What about down here?
[103:04.23]Rollercoaster?
[103:07.75]Carnival Kerfuffle.
[103:10.09]Beppy the Clown.
[103:14.05]Uh, yeah.
[103:17.17]Let's give it a try.
[103:18.49]Alright, he's on a go-kart.
[103:25.86]Alright, that doesn't... You can get hit by the ducks, for sure.
[103:38.00]Okay, they dropped these, like, fires.
[103:41.27]That was too quick.
[103:41.99]That's the ping.
[103:44.83]Ah, you can parry that one.
[103:45.65]Alright, this one's not that terrible to start.
[103:56.46]This one's not that bad.
[103:57.64]Just gotta watch out for the light bulbs.
[104:01.17]Come on, you fell off.
[104:02.71]Where is he now?
[104:07.61]Oh, boy.
[104:08.11]Can I land in these?
[104:12.94]I can.
[104:16.28]Oh, Jesus.
[104:17.10]Okay.
[104:18.68]Not that bad.
[104:19.18]Just gotta be patient.
[104:34.63]Just be patient.
[104:42.21]Come on, come on, come on, come on!
[104:43.89]Phase 3!
[104:45.33]What is it?
[104:45.69]He's on a horse.
[104:54.56]Alright, it's the... This is the long game.
[104:59.38]This is the... You gotta get the long con here.
[105:05.27]Oh, that was right off the bat.
[105:10.62]You gotta get this guy with the long con.
[105:14.93]Fuck.
[105:15.49]I'm being too cocky.
[105:16.65]I was only halfway.
[105:20.49]Can parry that nose on the rollercoaster?
[105:22.92]Alright, I gotta... Pay attention!
[105:27.48]You can't get hit in phase 1 or phase 2.
[105:30.42]You just can't.
[105:32.62]You can't do it.
[105:33.77]You're setting yourself up for disaster.
[105:48.05]It's just like super patient.
[105:59.12]Here we go.
[106:01.56]Squad down.
[106:04.60]I'm addicted to shooting the ducks.
[106:08.37]Don't even shoot the ducks.
[106:08.93]Why are you doing that?
[106:12.00]What?
[106:12.72]What the fuck just happened?
[106:13.78]What?
[106:14.24]Did I?
[106:16.50]I dashed like the other way.
[106:17.54]How the fuck did that happen?
[106:20.62]God damn it.
[106:22.45]I somehow dodged that.
[106:23.69]Give me those fucking iframes.
[106:43.77]That was bad that was bad bad bad bad bad I'm gonna die Like that all that sucked that like spawn I did
[107:09.95]I got, I just got, I got fucking collapsed on.
[107:12.07]That was fucking horse shit.
[107:14.47]That was absolute fucking dog shit.
[107:19.10]So was that.
[107:26.38]Stop collapsing on me with like five things at the same time.
[107:28.88]What's with the fucking light bulbs?
[107:31.09]Cut that shit out.
[107:33.91]Stop it.
[107:38.64]Sometimes when he goes forward twice, oh, it makes me want to fucking puke.
[107:41.08]Bring it on.
[107:55.48]Now, phase two.
[108:06.89]You can parry the front of the train.
[108:08.67]Alright, just play.
[108:09.23]Come on, get it out.
[108:10.03]Get it out of your system.
[108:11.07]There comes the train again.
[108:32.71]Oh my god.
[108:33.69]Why am I even trying to parry the train?
[108:35.63]I'm just going to get myself fucking killed.
[108:38.33]Like, why the fuck am I doing that?
[108:39.85]Just do it.
[108:40.57]Just shoot him.
[108:41.11]Like, oh, actually, I can parry train.
[108:42.75]But don't do that.
[108:43.39]What the fuck are you doing?
[108:44.67]Just dodge it.
[108:46.55]You fucking dummy.
[108:50.45]Train comes, I'm going to go for it.
[108:53.09]Here it comes.
[108:53.57]Ready?

[109:08.87]What is it?
[109:12.27]Huh?

[109:20.56]Lord.
[109:24.60]Huh?
[109:25.04]Hello.
[109:36.39]What?
[109:37.99]Fuck.
[109:45.81]Oh my god.
[109:54.28]I didn't expect that.
[109:55.04]How was I supposed to know that was gonna fucking happen?
[109:57.38]There's no way to know that.
[109:59.06]The train doesn't... Who's operating this carnival ride?
[110:03.32]Whoever you are, you're a dick.
[110:10.63]Alright, don't fuck it up this time.
[110:12.17]I got the first two down now.
[110:13.33]There he goes.
[110:30.44]Come on, fall out of the car.
[110:31.56]There we go.
[110:33.68]Alright.
[110:34.14]This time, don't do anything stupid.
[110:37.28]Just wait for the train.
[110:38.34]Don't jump on his face.
[110:43.45]Ah!
[110:45.03]It's over!
[110:46.21]I fucking lost all control of my hands!
[110:49.46]Oh f- Oh!
[110:55.32]Oh, I lost all control!
[110:56.76]I fucking- Mmm!
[111:11.89]Shit!
[111:14.54]My hands are, like, sweating.
[111:15.90]Alright, like, I seriously... I'm gonna go put baby powder on my hands.
[111:21.38]I'm gonna go load... I'm gonna go... You know, like, when the Olympics?
[111:27.95]When, like, the guy walks up to do the fucking double bars and he, like, slaps talcum powder all over his body?
[111:32.33]I have to go do that right now.
[111:35.61]Like, I have to, like, clap!
[111:37.25]Fucking... No, I'm doing it this time.
[111:41.15]Go ahead.
[111:43.15]The whole body's itchy.
[111:45.93]Get off of me.
[111:46.69]The fucking keyboard is stuck on me.
[111:48.25]Not the keyboard.
[111:48.83]What am I talking about?
[111:49.69]Shut up!
[111:51.03]Do it.
[111:51.43]Beat it.
[111:53.26]Just get to phase three again.
[111:57.18]I'm gonna make another Warcraft reference.
[111:59.90]Like, my guild got to, like, nearly the end of killing Ragnaros, and now we can't even get past the very first phase.
[112:06.67]And the guild leader is freaking out about it.
[112:09.72]You know, it's like, how did we get there that time?
[112:11.56]And like, we can't even get past the first phase now.
[112:13.94]And you start blaming people.
[112:17.17]No, no, no.
[112:17.51]What's your eye level?
[112:20.03]Our tank has an eye level of 320.
[112:21.29]That's what's happening.
[112:24.01]And then the guild fucking breaks apart.
[112:25.37]And everyone starts to hate each other.
[112:27.03]They break off into like two different cliques.
[112:34.02]Alright, I gotta get rid of this shit over here.
[112:36.30]Important.
[112:37.38]These have to all die.
[112:38.52]Quick.
[112:40.60]Got it.
[112:44.02]What did I hit?
[112:45.68]What hit me?
[112:50.20]What hit me?
[112:51.50]What actually hit that?
[112:52.30]I don't even know.
[112:53.42]Whoa!
[113:06.83]Not this time.
[113:08.68]The fucking first boss from The Simpsons arcade game, you're dead.
[113:11.88]I ain't fucking this one up.
[113:44.55]That's all the commentary you're getting out of me for the rest of the time.
[113:46.72]It's foos.
[113:50.08]I promise.
[113:50.50]Fuck you!
[113:52.16]Stop talking!
[113:52.86]No!
[114:26.83]No more sounds coming out of my fucking dirty mouth for the remainder of this fight I swear to God now starting now the code of silence is on now I
[115:06.56]That's the wrong fucking way somehow!
[115:22.01]My neck is itchy, there's like bugs on me.
[115:24.15]There's bugs all over me.
[115:26.75]You know like, baby spiders are all over my body.
[115:30.59]I'm not even kidding, like fucking, there was a hatch of baby spiders.
[115:34.39]And they're all trickling down on me like pieces of string.
[115:48.16]Good.
[115:48.52]Shh.

[117:23.17]I really might.
[117:25.19]I gotta take like a break.
[117:26.10]I gotta take a break and like fucking wash my hands.
[117:33.38]I gotta take a break, wash my hands, and like wash the spiders off my body.
[117:56.43]Don't fuck this up Good do it again
[118:57.44]What a bad place to do that.
[119:02.18]It's okay.
[119:02.90]It's okay!
[119:14.07]Okay, here we go.
[119:23.28]Here comes the fast fucking train.
[119:25.50]Sit up.
[119:26.08]Hands wiped.
[119:26.98]Go.
[119:49.10]Here's a real high-class
[120:11.54]Okay, so note to self.
[120:13.96]Penguins.
[120:14.64]The penguins come down.
[120:15.60]They've got to die immediately because they spam baseballs in every direction.
[120:20.10]Okay.
[120:20.94]I can get there again without a problem.
[120:22.66]Shouldn't be a problem.
[120:25.22]Shouldn't be an issue.
[120:26.78]Watch out for the baseball penguins.
[120:34.01]Good day for us.
[120:35.25]Well done.
[120:36.51]And begin.
[120:37.03]Oh, man.
[120:45.96]You guys remember the end of Undertale?
[120:48.26]When I told you that the colors were just blending into each other?
[120:51.96]Like the whole world was blending into itself.
[120:54.58]That's kind of how I feel right now.
[120:59.49]After this attempt, I am going to go get a water.
[121:01.51]I feel like I'm playing a sport.
[121:07.09]I just ran like a mile on the treadmill.
[121:15.99]Shake your head around.
[121:17.41]Get it.
[121:19.88]Didn't get it.
[121:23.17]Don't let it sour you.
[121:50.77]I was paying way too much attention.
[121:51.91]This- Wow.
[121:52.79]God.
[121:53.13]Fuck.
[121:53.35]Shut up.
[121:53.79]Just- I gotta get that water.
[121:56.47]I gotta go get that water in the world.
[122:03.79]That's too- I can't- It's going a different direction now.
[122:07.01]If we don't start- If we didn't start the way- Oh, fucking Jesus Christ.
[122:22.26]I'm gonna go do a fucking enema.
[122:29.41]That's what I need.
[122:29.89]I need to do, like, an enema right now.
[122:32.81]One of those real... You know, just... And I fucked it all up.
[122:35.47]Did I get him?
[122:36.17]Oh my god, I hate myself.
[122:39.06]Oh my god, I'm a fucking idiot.
[122:40.26]And how am I gonna get rid of this shit?
[122:43.00]What the fuck was I supposed to do there?
[122:45.39]What was I supposed to do there?
[122:47.47]You just die.
[122:48.19]If you get that kind of fucking RNG, you die.
[122:51.37]You just die there.
[122:52.57]There's nothing I can do.
[122:54.18]You just die.
[122:54.68]You just lose.
[122:55.16]My life is pain.
[123:02.87]This boss is pain.
[123:09.27]It will be worth it after I beat it.
[123:10.55]I got close enough where I can do it.
[123:14.37]I just need to go do an enema real quick.
[123:22.64]This game is hard, but fair.
[123:24.16]Look, it's not unfair.
[123:25.52]It is.
[123:26.16]It's unfair.
[123:26.68]No, it's not.
[123:27.08]Don't shut up.
[123:27.74]Stop excusing it.
[123:28.68]It's excuses.
[123:29.86]We don't have excuses here.
[123:30.96]That didn't hit anybody.
[123:51.09]My hands are stuck.
[124:02.64]Why did it not... I don't know, I can't even give you an excuse.
[124:05.44]Like, why the fuck did that not happen?
[124:10.40]I can't give you an excuse.
[124:11.28]I was trying to parry that thing because I was stuck over there, and the input just... I didn't do it, apparently.
[124:23.17]Fuck me.
[124:43.47]I hate when it comes fucking right to left.
[124:45.07]It makes me want to fucking throw up.
[125:04.28]Alright, come on.
[125:08.99]Fall off.
[125:11.75]Come on, fall off.
[125:12.65]Good.
[125:14.09]Alright, penguins.
[125:15.35]Penguins are priority.
[125:17.05]Penguins are priority.
[125:21.38]What do you think, ground level?
[125:23.30]I don't even know.
[125:24.50]I'm just going to pay attention here.
[125:36.89]You gotta go up top, down here for the penguins.
[125:39.47]Here we go, ready?
[125:40.33]Wow.
[125:41.31]Wait, what?
[125:41.69]Can you not kill them?
[125:59.48]I can't go over there.
[126:17.95]I'm done.
[126:18.87]I did it.
[126:20.05]I did it.
[126:20.47]I don't want to do that one.
[126:23.29]It's not even hard.
[126:36.90]You want a facecam for this?
[126:38.13]No.
[126:38.71]You're not going to get a facecam for this.
[126:39.91]I'm sorry, guys.
[126:40.43]It's not going to happen.
[126:41.69]No.
[126:42.01]I'm too self-conscious how fucked up I would look playing this game and how angry I would look.
[126:51.28]That be the clown.
[126:52.20]He sucked.
[126:56.90]I'm going to give you facecam for one.
[126:58.68]How does that sound?
[127:00.88]You get one.
[127:03.32]What?
[127:03.70]Come on.
[127:07.72]There you go.
[127:17.41]You get one.
[127:19.73]Whatever this is.
[127:24.46]For all your battles and all my rhymes, you have failed and perished 34 times.
[127:28.07]Okay.
[127:28.33]You get one attempt with the facecam.
[127:38.55]I don't want you guys to see my, like, crazy faces that I make when I play these games.
[127:43.24]It's kind of, like, embarrassing.
[127:46.12]Alright, we got a couple of more levels.
[127:47.26]What's this one?
[127:49.28]Aviary action.
[127:50.76]Okay.
[127:52.80]So here we go, this is like, I'm gonna play the game like I normally would.
[127:56.19]I remember this one from the trailer.
[128:02.37]No!
[128:24.00]I'm just kidding, that's not how I... Alright, for real, let's go.
[128:27.02]Here's what I actually act like.
[128:34.24]Breaks.
[128:39.96]Ooh, two came up quick.
[128:50.81]Ah, you do the double, you do the double.
[128:57.60]I should be smart at this.
[129:05.95]Give me a bird brain.
[129:18.64]Kill.
[129:20.52]Kill.
[129:20.84]Alright, he's turning into a turkey.
[129:23.90]Oh, there's that guy.
[129:24.84]Alright, whatever that means.
[129:25.88]Phase 2.
[129:28.63]Stay close.
[129:36.21]That's not that bad.
[129:36.83]I can do that.
[129:38.09]I'll get it.
[129:39.15]A brawl is surely brewing.
[129:40.88]A brawl is surely brewing.
[129:42.32]Go, go, go!
[129:49.96]That's what fucked me up last time.
[129:52.28]I'll get there without getting hit.
[129:54.34]Guaranteed.
[129:57.75]Guaranteed.
[129:59.83]Here's a real high-class belt.
[130:09.97]And begin!
[130:18.49]This mask will get red hot.
[130:20.94]Here goes.
[130:23.48]I've read a mic.
[130:29.53]I gotta be, like, pretty red, right?
[130:34.95]Bad.
[130:35.61]Bad.
[130:36.19]Like, bad.
[130:38.81]Don't give me this shit right now.
[130:42.25]It's fine.
[130:48.97]Go ahead, do it.
[130:52.27]Shake around like a wild, wild man.
[131:01.66]So far, so good.
[131:02.76]And I have a bomb.
[131:03.54]I'm not going to use it.
[131:04.30]I don't need to.
[131:05.48]I'll use it when he gets to the little guy.
[131:07.00]When he turns into Megamind, that's when I'm going to use the bomb.
[131:25.93]Woo!
[131:26.17]Alright, do it.
[131:26.65]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[131:28.70]There we go.
[131:30.14]And he's bomb right now.
[131:36.94]Watch out.
[131:38.76]I don't know what he does now.
[131:40.24]When he turns around, I don't know.
[131:41.22]Does he get a laser beam?
[131:49.71]That could have been bad.
[131:52.55]Now eggs just start to come out of nowhere.
[131:53.85]What?
[131:56.15]That was a fucking dodge if I've ever seen one.
[132:19.19]Oh, shit!
[132:46.51]That's old.
[132:49.21]Good game for a swell battle.
[132:51.65]Now go.
[132:55.34]Come on, Cuphead.
[133:02.96]Come on, Gwyn.
[133:03.40]That was close.
[133:21.23]There he goes.
[133:21.57]Go ahead.
[133:22.65]Freak out.
[133:23.15]I want to get out of this as soon as possible.
[133:34.62]I don't even need to fight those.
[133:36.62]If I'm not going for parries, then who cares?
[133:38.46]There you go.
[133:42.54]Perfect.
[133:42.82]Okay, here we go.
[133:43.38]Nice.

[140:46.86]Mr. Destructoid.
[140:49.42]Alright, let's go.
[140:51.98]Keep movin'.
[140:55.27]Let's go into this place.
[140:57.93]Mausoleum 2.
[140:58.51]This is just another one of those situations where you can press A, A, A, A. Ready?
[141:06.39]Go!
[141:07.87]Three, two, one, go!
[141:16.10]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[141:20.51]This anti-claws, put him in a casket.
[141:23.95]Drag him down the street and then feed him to the dogs.
[141:27.32]It's that same song.
[141:37.10]Oh!
[141:43.45]Get over here.
[141:52.68]Is that it?
[141:59.40]Not quite.
[142:01.03]Almost there.
[142:07.47]Victory!
[142:10.23]Sweet.
[142:10.45]That's another one of these things, another superpower.
[142:15.58]I knew if I rooted around here, I could find something special for you, but I didn't know I'd get trapped again.
[142:20.44]Thanks for saving me a second time.
[142:22.77]Take this magical super art, and I'll see if I can find you another.
[142:27.81]Cool.
[142:30.23]I need to play more PC-friendly games.
[142:31.97]It's making the chat scared.
[142:36.20]New super, what is it?
[142:39.60]Super art 1, energy beam super art 2, invincibility.
[142:44.49]Hmm.
[142:46.85]Let's try it.
[142:50.43]I like this setup still.
[142:51.41]I have three coins.
[142:53.47]What's Mr. Lightbulb have to say?
[142:55.66]So you have spoken with the Quadratus, the watery being across the isle.
[143:00.44]That is something few others can claim.
[143:01.76]Just tells you how many times I've died.
[143:05.14]Nothing over there?
[143:05.66]Sundial?
[143:06.14]No.
[143:08.76]Is the game only boss battles?
[143:10.40]Uh, no.
[143:11.84]It is mostly boss battles.
[143:14.49]As you'll see here in about five seconds or so.
[143:18.37]Let me see if I got everybody here.
[143:20.33]Did I beat all the bosses in this area?
[143:24.32]There's a shop.
[143:24.96]Another bridge.
[143:29.88]Yeah, okay.
[143:30.58]I think I... Did I go down all the way?
[143:36.84]Yeah, I beat the roller coaster.
[143:38.25]And that led to down here.
[143:39.81]I think I just have to beat that level.
[143:43.53]Pretty sure I did it.
[143:45.16]Alright, let's beat the level.
[143:45.82]So, a person was asking, is it just boss battles?
[143:48.30]You're about to find out the answer is no.
[143:51.29]There are run and gun levels as well.
[143:53.99]Like Funfair Fever.
[143:59.61]Run and gun!
[144:01.35]Into the carnival we go!
[144:02.41]Tickets!
[144:04.71]Get your tickets here!
[144:07.19]Trampoline.
[144:09.38]Well, okay.
[144:10.90]That was a thing I could parry.
[144:15.93]Does he follow you through the whole thing?
[144:17.29]Come here.
[144:18.07]Back here.
[144:20.09]Oh, boy.
[144:21.01]Alright, well.
[144:24.01]Okay.
[144:26.29]Interestingly enough.
[144:29.49]What?
[144:29.81]It didn't pop the balloon.
[144:32.76]What the hell was that?
[144:33.62]I parried the balloon.
[144:35.66]It didn't pop.
[144:47.41]What do these do?
[144:48.63]Oh, they... Okay, I get it.
[144:53.35]That's fine.
[144:54.63]Oh!
[144:55.35]That was almost there.
[144:57.57]Hello.
[144:58.32]Now I understand.
[145:00.26]Let's go.
[145:14.35]Don't even pop them.
[145:15.01]They're more dangerous if you pop them if you don't.
[145:17.87]Get over here.
[145:22.61]You're making my life a living hell right now, man.
[145:24.23]Thank you.
[145:25.81]There we are.
[145:28.63]I got the coin too.
[145:29.95]Good.
[145:35.40]Cuphead!
[145:38.86]Yes!
[145:39.66]More coins.
[145:41.68]Get Mr. Pinocchio.
[145:44.86]Alright, be careful here.
[145:45.76]Don't get dropped down.
[145:46.82]That's alright.
[145:47.86]Oh!
[145:48.28]Oh, fuck!
[145:48.88]I don't wanna... Oh, shit!
[146:14.93]Heck you, get out of the way.
[146:17.51]I only got one heart.
[146:21.35]Oh, the fucking stupid bullet!
[146:22.69]The stupid dog food pellet!
[146:25.86]Oh, that stupid dog food pellet from the left just hit me.
[146:28.74]Fuck you.
[146:30.06]Oh, fuck you, game.
[146:31.32]Fuck you, game.
[146:31.88]That was bullshit.
[146:34.14]The stupid, like, olive pit came from the left side of the screen and hit me in the back.
[146:44.70]Not again.
[146:47.02]Cut the shit.
[146:50.36]Back here, dog.
[146:51.42]What's the magician's name from Mario?
[147:01.74]The one that sucks and throws the triangles at you.
[147:06.86]What's that guy's name?
[147:08.56]Makitu?
[147:09.30]No.
[147:09.66]Alright, quiet.
[147:20.14]What are you doing?!
[147:21.52]What are you doing?! !
[147:45.39]Ah, I just... God damn it!
[147:49.89]What the fuck?
[147:56.08]Oh, you fucking eat my asshole.
[148:00.08]Seriously, I'm gonna stuff my asshole with that balloon's fucking mouth.
[148:06.52]I'm going to fucking... I'm gonna strangle that balloon.
[148:12.15]Watch out for the fucking olive pit.
[148:15.39]I'm concerned for his mental well-being.
[148:25.37]X-ray and screamer.
[148:30.52]Fuck you, Pinocchio.
[148:34.00]5 o'clock shadow, Pinocchio.
[148:35.22]Yeah, you're like 40.
[148:37.34]You're older than me.
[148:39.38]That story came out in like 1940.
[148:53.63]Oh, you asshole.
[148:55.51]Get out of my way.
[148:58.71]Get out of here.
[149:20.33]Oh!
[149:21.25]Oh no, what is this?
[149:22.36]Broke it.
[149:24.12]Two bucks.
[149:25.64]Nice.
[149:26.36]Any other coins?
[149:27.18]I don't want to miss any coins.
[149:46.45]S?
[149:47.59]N?
[149:47.97]Is that a hamburger?
[149:50.37]That's a pretzel.
[149:51.26]Oh, that's awesome.
[149:52.26]That's so cool.
[149:53.10]Snack bar!
[149:58.46]Snacks!
[150:03.70]Oh my god, I'm paying attention to, like, the snacks.
[150:16.90]Alright, easy.
[150:20.98]Snacks and treats.
[150:25.81]Look at all these treats.
[150:33.09]OH!
[150:37.57]I'm invincible, right?
[150:38.70]What's happening?
[150:43.67]I'm soaking.
[150:44.15]Okay, my brain hurts.
[150:46.31]I was trying to kill him with the... Oh, man.
[150:52.23]I hate when people call candy treats.
[151:03.95]Why?
[151:05.71]Ow, ears.
[151:08.78]That lasts for like two seconds.
[151:09.68]I don't know about that super.
[151:10.62]Yeah, we'll have to see.
[151:11.62]We'll have to see.
[151:16.09]Invincibility does not seem like it's any good.
[151:18.17]That's true.
[151:25.09]That's it, right?
[151:25.65]For this area?
[151:29.27]Eight coins.
[151:31.89]Let's go to the shop.
[151:32.55]Alright, this is the new EX.
[151:40.67]Great coverage with an... I wish I could see what it looks like.
[151:46.00]Automatic parry.
[151:46.74]Charge.
[151:47.36]Hold attack to increase damage.
[151:48.80]No rapid fire, so precision is key.
[151:51.90]That's kind of cool.
[151:54.78]I want it.
[151:56.62]And then this one's a medium range and good damage with a slower rate of fire.
[151:59.38]This is a little EXR.
[152:03.58]I don't know.
[152:10.40]I might just hold on to them.
[152:15.02]Maybe Lobber.
[152:15.92]Let's try.
[152:23.65]Let's give Charge a try.
[152:24.41]I want to see.
[152:26.81]So we got shot A. This is Lobber.
[152:30.35]Medium range and good damage with a slow rate of fire.
[152:33.81]Charge.
[152:35.17]Hold attack to increase damage.
[152:36.29]Let's make this Charge and then... I'm going to give it a try.
[152:42.44]Why not?
[152:44.11]So go up and where are... So you spoke with a... Over here?
[152:51.63]I guess I gotta go up?
[153:01.37]Let's put on... I don't know.
[153:03.13]I feel like the invincibility might actually be useful.
[153:06.23]If I'm in a panic.
[153:07.35]You know what I mean?
[153:10.43]Barbershop trio.
[153:11.37]No, I gotta go through here.
[153:12.46]Okay, there's another level.
[153:16.07]What about up here?
[153:18.23]One of the jugglers from Mario RPG.
[153:21.47]Well, hey there, fellas.
[153:22.41]Welcome to watch my... Come to watch my little show, have you?
[153:25.08]They say juggling is a bit like parrying.
[153:27.22]You know, at first, but soon you can string them together swimmingly.
[153:30.72]I'm hoping to get to four someday.
[153:32.90]Four in a row.
[153:33.44]Yeah, that would be something, wouldn't it?
[153:37.33]Fiery Frolic.
[153:38.11]Let's try...
[153:47.59]Probably shouldn't go fight a boss.
[153:48.87]Oh, now I can... How long do you charge it for?
[153:56.30]Okay.
[153:58.66]One, two.
[153:59.48]One, two.
[154:03.32]Overblowing.
[154:03.76]It's not bad.
[154:08.10]I like the little lob.
[154:14.96]A little on the slow side, but it's okay.
[154:17.44]I don't hate it.
[154:17.94]What about the new... Ow.
[154:19.88]What about the new power I got?
[154:21.78]What is it?
[154:25.14]Alright.
[154:28.39]Well, that's called me learning how to use the new ability.
[154:32.65]Okay.
[154:33.03]What is he doing?
[154:41.43]Does the game not know I'm dead?
[154:47.02]I think the king thinks I'm still alive.
[154:53.79]This is so cool, though.
[154:54.89]Ah!
[154:57.61]How long does he do this move for?
[155:04.01]He's not stopping.
[155:16.13]I think I have to reset the game.
[155:19.81]Just keep watching to make a strategy.
[155:21.51]Alright.
[155:21.85]I see that you got... I'm just going to do it in the middle.
[155:24.61]Just stand at the top right.
[155:25.83]Okay.
[155:29.54]So, it looks like we're going to have to alt-stab this.
[155:34.38]We're going to have to alt-stab this.
[155:36.46]Yeah, sorry.
[155:40.22]Game had to get alt-stabbed.
[155:45.39]Let's try it again.
[155:49.27]Cuphead, come back to me.
[155:53.62]That's just phase three.
[155:59.26]Is it even on the screen right now?
[156:01.32]There we go.
[156:03.46]Well, that's the first bug we've seen pretty much the whole game. 48%.
[156:17.46]Let's say... Yes, it... Wait.
[156:19.78]Yeah, it did.
[156:20.40]Okay.
[156:24.68]I think... I'm going to keep... I'm going to try this.
[156:42.72]I'll put on the energy beam again.
[156:44.64]I only have one charm...
[156:50.17]48% already.
[156:51.13]Yes.
[156:51.93]Apparently.
[156:56.75]I'm going to assume that... How many bosses have I seen so far?
[157:03.37]I haven't really been keeping count.
[157:09.76]Am I going to finish the whole game tonight?
[157:11.70]Ah, that depends.
[157:15.11]I've been going for just about three hours.
[157:18.71]I've died... forty times.
[157:29.17]Twenty bucks for a two-hour game is pretty shit.
[157:31.61]Ah, well, I'm not done.
[157:34.49]The game's not done.
[157:39.16]I didn't, like, beat the game yet.
[157:43.02]Uh, where the hell am I going?
[157:45.22]It's probably like a six-hour game.
[157:46.86]Like six to eight hours.
[157:50.08]I bought everything, right?
[157:51.06]I already purchased all the things I need to purchase.

[182:38.67]At least we have to, right?
[182:48.44]That's not the problem.

[186:00.01]Oh, without the triangles, I'll beat this every fucking time.
[186:04.99]And if you try to jump and parry them, you're gonna get hit by the other triangle.
[186:09.30]You're gonna get hit by the other one that you spewed out.
[186:11.04]Ah-ha-ha!
[186:15.03]I need another animal.
[186:16.66]That's the only way this is gonna work.
[186:18.40]I need to shove a fucking tube.
[186:27.92]Fuck triangles, man.
[186:30.95]And the fact that they spin around and you only have that one spot, and then you have to jump on platforms.

[187:41.76]It's too much to have to think about.
[187:43.16]You know like scratching your head and fucking rubbing your belly?
[187:47.97]Alright, well imagine scratching your head, rubbing your belly, but you have eight arms.
[187:52.54]And you're scratching your fucking friend's ass and rubbing his head.
[187:56.10]And grabbing his fucking stomach.
[187:58.02]While you're rubbing your stomach, scratching your friend's beard.
[188:02.11]Doing your taxes with the other hand.
[188:04.53]And making dinner with the other two.
[188:06.45]That's what this level is.
[188:11.45]And now I'm just angry.
[188:13.25]Good day for a well battled.
[188:15.73]Now go!
[188:30.44]I think I might be mentally drained.
[188:33.56]I think this game took all of my powers.
[188:35.32]This game took all of my powers.
[188:38.80]This game drained me of all of my powers!
[188:48.68]Okay, here are the bees.
[188:51.38]What a bad layout for the bees.
[188:59.21]What is this?
[188:59.75]What the fuck is this?
[189:00.85]Look at this fucking layout!
[189:02.19]What the hell are you supposed to make me do there?
[189:04.35]What was that layout?
[189:05.47]You fucker!
[189:08.09]What, did you forget to put cones there?
[189:09.71]Ayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayay
[189:31.53]Fucking God!
[189:34.41]That needs another full second before it comes in.
[189:57.99]A brawl is surely brewing.
[190:04.74]Distant scream.
[190:09.34]Fuck.
[190:10.12]I don't want to make dinner.
[190:11.76]Those triangles have vained my existence.
[190:13.92]I just need to save my soup before when the fucking triangle comes out.
[190:21.85]Why are you here?
[190:22.75]Go to hell.
[190:30.16]Okay, come on.
[190:31.62]I don't even have a super yet.
[190:36.54]Triangle, right?
[190:37.26]I know.
[190:37.84]Yeah.
[190:42.40]God.
[190:42.92]Oh my god.
[190:43.68]Oh my god.
[190:45.00]Those fucking triangles are so bad.
[190:50.09]It's so bad.
[190:52.87]This is probably what you get invincibility for.
[190:54.97]Because those things are fucking unmanageable.
[190:58.99]They take up, like, such a huge part of the real estate of where you can stand.
[191:05.43]What is with that?
[191:06.77]All the other stuff is manageable, you can't even... And what is with the fucking missing platforms?
[191:23.09]Eat shit, game.
[191:26.78]It's free real estate.
[191:27.84]It's just making me want to die.
[191:36.88]I'm getting that... You've seen me play through this boss like 12, 15, 100, 1000 times now.
[191:45.15]It's only those triangles that are causing me any real problems.
[191:49.93]Because they're stupid.
[191:53.51]That's just a fact.
[191:59.04]And now I'm gonna just tank the whole thing and just annihilate this stupid fucking alien woman.
[192:05.33]Don't do it again.
[192:06.47]Give me the balls.
[192:08.99]Fucking asshole.
[192:28.14]Parry?
[192:28.56]Well, yeah, but after you parry, you jump, you bump into the shit that she shoots in the air above you.
[192:35.74]Fucking god.
[192:47.99]Like, I'm just gonna try to parry chain that whole- But no, it's not gonna work.
[192:53.87]Because, like, you eventually hit a platform, and you stand.
[192:57.94]If there was empty space, maybe it would work.
[193:00.12]But... God, I'm gonna piss my fucking pants.
[193:15.31]Oh, I'm so angry right now.
[193:22.07]You could cook... You could cook an egg on my forehead right now.
[193:27.94]A brawl is surely brewing.
[193:30.34]Here goes!
[193:32.04]Like, if I laid on the fucking pavement and pulled my shirt up, you could cook two eggs on my stomach.
[193:47.31]You're like, seriously, Chris?
[193:50.79]I'm just, uh, I might have to stop.
[193:53.17]I might have to stop streaming.
[193:56.52]This game is hitting that part of my brain where if you play this game for more than two hours, you're going to lose your fucking mind.
[194:04.30]I'm gonna be in a goddamn... I'm gonna be admitted.
[194:10.04]I'm gonna turn the facecam on.
[194:11.91]I'm gonna be put in a fucking straitjacket.
[194:17.71]Screaming about the bees.
[194:20.25]They're gonna be like, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
[194:21.97]He's screaming about triangles and bees.
[194:24.39]We need to get him in here quick.
[194:38.04]Come on, give me this all day.
[194:41.06]Give this shit to me every day.
[194:44.04]What?
[194:44.60]See what I'm talking about?
[194:45.26]You... No.
[194:57.45]It's landing on the platforms.
[194:59.11]That's the fucking problem, guys.
[195:02.29]Oh, no.
[195:02.97]I gotta take a break.
[195:03.85]I gotta get out of here.
[195:15.46]Well, here comes the fucking invincibility.
[195:20.02]Not yet.
[195:23.16]Oh my fucking... I'm not even close.
[195:33.31]I'm not even fucking close.
[195:34.83]This one is the one that is gonna give me like the four hours of trouble.
[195:44.31]It's the consistently moving background that you have to climb.
[195:49.82]Ayayay.
[195:52.80]Like, how many other languages can I speak to say, like, fuck this?
[196:03.87]How do you say fuck this in other languages?
[196:24.46]Triangles.
[196:24.90]Ah!
[197:11.32]What is she doing?
[197:11.94]I don't know what this is, so I'm gonna do this.
[197:19.45]She turns into a fucking airplane?
[197:32.53]Die!
[197:37.05]Die!
[197:46.14]Oh my god!
[197:54.39]No!
[197:55.25]That fucking pixel!
[197:56.73]That one!
[198:18.60]Oh, that's so fucking unfair.
[198:23.47]Oh, I was right there, too.
[198:26.09]Oh, man.
[198:26.95]Oh, man.
[198:29.19]I'm so... I'm not even angry.
[198:31.19]I'm, like, sad.
[198:35.15]Anger's not even the right word.
[198:36.57]It's just sadness.
[198:39.33]It's just like a deep-seated fucking deep-rooted depression.
[198:48.52]Like, this is how I felt when, like, my dog died.
[198:51.07]This is, like, how bad I feel.
[198:58.62]It's like, did I lose in Cuphead, or did I lose a family fucking pet?
[199:02.96]I'm not entirely sure.
[199:18.21]Bad spot.
[199:18.79]Really bad.
[199:19.25]Where you going?
[199:22.87]Oh, will you get it?
[199:24.73]Ball, please get out of here.
[199:25.73]Ball, get out of here.
[199:34.88]Oh!
[199:42.00]Bad, bad, bad, bad.
[199:53.31]Give me the airplane.
[199:55.55]Here we go.
[199:55.93]I didn't even need to use that here, by the way.
[199:58.03]I'm gonna use it here.
[199:59.17]I'm losing my mind.
[200:39.39]Get me out of here.
[200:40.53]Get me the fuck out of here.
[200:41.47]I'm done.
[200:41.97]It's over.
[200:42.33]I did it.
[200:43.03]I did it.
[200:43.57]I did it.
[200:43.85]My dog is still alive.
[200:45.99]My dog is still alive.
[200:59.23]You see this?
[200:59.73]Look at this.
[201:01.41]No, not my receding hairline.
[201:04.93]Look at my... Forget I said anything.
[201:17.76]My fucking body hurts.
[201:23.18]This game is... I love this game.
[201:26.57]This game is really, really great.
[201:28.15]It's like scratching that itch, and I hate it.
[201:30.29]No, I love it.
[201:31.01]I hate this game.
[201:33.51]I love this game.
[201:36.53]Oh, boy.
[201:37.13]Alright.
[201:43.30]That was a tough one.
[201:45.96]What about this one?
[201:49.28]Shootin' and lootin'.
[201:56.39]Oh, it's Bluto from Popeye!
[202:06.17]Okay, well... I thought... I gotta get, uh... I don't know... I guess you have to use... Uh... Mm-mm.
[202:16.10]No, no, no, no, no.
[202:20.12]No, no, no, no, no.
[202:21.12]One sec.
[202:22.90]We're gonna do the pea shooter.
[202:25.22]And the charge shot.
[202:28.83]Invincibility is fine, I guess.
[202:30.73]When was the last time I shaved?
[202:34.81]I've been waiting to shave because I'm going to California tomorrow.
[202:39.27]Like, my excuses are fucking terrible.
[202:49.82]I don't want to bring my shaving shit to California.
[202:58.92]Alright, so far not a huge problem.
[203:01.04]But what is he doing now?
[203:03.88]He shoots out fish dogs.
[203:12.66]Alright, what do you got?
[203:13.32]Anything more?
[203:13.82]You got like the Spongebob, one of the Spongebob fishes?
[203:17.24]Alright.
[203:18.74]And the dogs again.
[203:19.40]Is that a shark?
[203:22.82]Okay, that was a shark.
[203:23.98]Alright, I just, that was a shark.
[203:26.08]A shark shows up when he, okay.
[203:36.41]Now he's crying.
[203:38.22]Shoot him in the tonsil.
[203:49.30]I thought I was... Okay.
[203:50.58]Okay.
[203:50.72]That was 100,000 times easier than the B.
[204:10.09]That was like... I'll take nine of those before I do another bee.
[204:18.34]Speaking of bees.
[204:30.07]Captain Brainybeard.
[204:31.49]Brainybeard.
[204:34.65]Let me get one second here to say thanks to StyxRenegade for the five bucks.
[204:38.94]Imagine when you get beaten up, your body turns into an anthropomorphic plane.
[204:44.98]That's true.
[204:46.28]It would be great because if you were getting your ass kicked, you would just fly away.
[204:49.84]Think about that.
[204:50.24]Think of you getting attacked by like ten people.
[204:52.88]It's like, what am I gonna do?
[204:54.60]Oh shit, I can't go anywhere.
[204:56.10]You just turn into a plane and you just fly away.
[204:58.14]That sounds pretty great.
[205:00.26]Thanks for the five bucks though, dude.
[205:02.24]Shimmy Sham, thanks for the dollar.
[205:03.21]Go to the store and buy some health.
[205:05.49]Yeah, but that's... I don't want to do less damage.
[205:08.07]I know I'm a piece of shit for saying that, but I don't want to do less damage.
[205:19.42]Well... Bloodborne's already on PS4, so I own a PS4.
[205:24.18]Unless they were going to make it like 60 FPS, then I'm not sure why I would care that much, but... You know what would be great?
[205:29.54]Because then more people could play Bloodborne.
[205:30.80]It's a great game.
[205:32.74]Uh, Deadly Pig Poot, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[205:36.90]Play a nice, easy game like Cookie Clicker.
[205:41.04]No, I can't.
[205:42.98]I don't know what this, like, last week or two has been, but I'm, like, playing the games that make me want to tear my hair out, like Demon's Souls, fucking Cuphead.
[205:49.87]I can't wait to go back to play, like, Tony Hawk Ride with the shitty skateboard peripheral.
[205:55.75]Although I am immensely enjoying these more difficult games.
[205:58.37]They're fun.
[206:00.40]But, uh, thank you DeadlyPigPoot.
[206:01.80]Also, you gave $5.
[206:03.98]Those triangles... Screw those triangles.
[206:08.22]Cheer, cheer, cheer.
[206:08.98]Thanks, man.
[206:10.21]I agree.
[206:11.73]Sam, thanks for the $1.
[206:13.17]What's the difference between a dirty bus stop and a lobster with implants?
[206:17.49]One's a crusty bus station, the other is a busty crustacean.
[206:22.71]Uh... Bingo!
[206:28.01]Uh, thank you again, DeadlyPigPoot, again for $15.
[206:30.91]You find the best games.
[206:32.57]This stream is lit.
[206:35.70]Uh, it... I... Look.
[206:37.90]Okay, I just looked down and got fucking so scared.
[206:42.20]Let me show you something.
[206:43.80]I, like, put my fucking head down and was like, what the fuck happened?
[206:48.49]Look at this.
[206:50.45]Let me show you this.
[206:57.61]I looked down and I'm just like, what the fuck happened to my keyboard?
[206:59.85]I just swiped my hands on it.
[207:09.92]I was like freaked out.
[207:15.62]I think that catches me up though.
[207:17.25]Thank you guys.
[207:19.19]Thanks for the bits.
[207:19.77]Appreciate it everybody.
[207:23.75]This is just like dust.
[207:24.95]I can blow it up.
[207:27.66]I can blow out the dust.
[207:28.54]It's not a big deal.
[207:30.06]Let's talk to the pirate, though.
[207:33.50]Arr, you're going to need some tips if you want to keelhaul these deadbeats.
[207:37.21]Start by mixing up your weaponry.
[207:38.95]Can't expect all your arms to work the same on every foe.
[207:42.31]Mix and match landlubbers, that's what I say.
[207:45.89]Good advice.
[207:50.76]Can't go through here.
[207:51.68]Already beat the bee.
[207:52.44]And already beat this guy.
[207:56.74]We have a level to do.
[207:59.90]What else is there?
[208:00.40]There's a tortoise.
[208:02.60]You boys think your situation is a multi-color mess, don't you?
[208:06.14]But what if I told you there was a way to see it in shades of gray?
[208:10.26]A way that only a pacifist platformer would be able to perceive.
[208:13.74]Would you violent little mugs believe me if I told you that?
[208:16.56]I wonder.
[208:18.81]So there's like a black and white mode that you can unlock, probably.
[208:21.59]Alright, look.
[208:23.63]Perilous Peers.
[208:26.94]I'm going to get the bad ending, probably.
[208:28.26]Wouldn't be surprised.
[208:33.77]You know, the one thing I will say, I was concerned that these in-between levels were going to be... not fleshed out and kind of shitty.
[208:42.91]But they're not.
[208:44.05]They're very different.
[208:45.23]They have interesting fights, interesting monsters.
[208:47.26]I was a little concerned that they might not be that great.
[208:50.68]But I've enjoyed them so far.
[208:52.52]They're just as challenging as the boss fights.
[208:55.44]And they're very fun, too.
[208:57.11]And I just blew it because I need to get a flying fish to get this coin.
[209:01.93]I already blew it.
[209:02.43]Come on.
[209:03.87]Don't, like, don't... Come over here.
[209:05.93]Give me, like, a flying fish.
[209:07.59]Right here.
[209:11.44]Got it.
[209:16.16]I wish that could go through people.
[209:17.38]If that could pierce, that'd be great.
[209:18.34]Remember that accuracy that they said I needed to have?
[209:24.14]Apparently I don't have it.
[209:27.78]I think I just have to get on top of his box.
[209:31.86]I guess.
[209:35.32]Oh, boy.
[209:37.09]And I'm dead.
[209:40.13]Wow, it's like the game took years of time to make or something.
[209:45.27]You can see the love that was put in this game.
[209:47.03]You can.
[209:48.77]And regardless of how short it is, I mean, how long do you think it'll end up being here?
[209:55.32]If I'm like 60, 70% of the way through the game...
[209:59.47]Maybe like... I don't know.
[210:07.01]Fuck.
[210:08.51]I gotta stop paying that much attention to that shit.
[210:10.83]Just kill everybody.
[210:14.84]This setup is awful.
[210:16.70]I really need to get the homing.
[210:17.58]The homing here would be so much better.
[210:20.04]All the fish and everything flying around.
[210:21.50]I don't have to jump and aim and tilt and everything.
[210:23.16]I can just hold the button down.
[210:38.67]Whoa, starfish.
[210:42.01]Whoa.
[210:44.01]Dude's doing the backstroke.
[210:45.39]Oh my god.
[210:46.49]Okay.
[210:46.85]I'm going to put that on.
[210:58.11]Backstroke.
[210:59.77]Yeah, I'm gonna put on the chaser here.
[211:03.03]And the shotgun.
[211:04.33]Chaser shotgun.
[211:08.68]The busty crust.
[211:09.44]Yeah, that was a busty crustacean.
[211:12.66]Yeah, so this is better.
[211:13.34]Because they're very annoying.
[211:19.06]Shouldn't have killed that one, but I did.
[211:32.66]Mmm, didn't go fast enough.
[211:34.48]Shit.
[211:41.31]Come on!
[211:43.63]There we are.
[211:44.31]Hello.
[211:52.88]Whack, whack, whack.
[211:56.64]These fish remind me of something.
[211:58.44]I don't know what, though.
[212:02.05]I was very lucky.
[212:02.94]That was extraordinarily lucky.
[212:06.26]Nah, fucking wrong button.
[212:07.52]Ugh!
[212:09.70]I swear to God, playing Demon... Playing Demon's Souls and playing, like, Dark Souls, I'm pressing triangles to switch wa- You know what?
[212:30.00]Yeah.
[212:39.29]What is why right now?
[212:42.31]Yeah, this is gonna confuse me even more, ain't it?
[212:43.91]I've already been playing the whole game like this.
[212:51.94]Oh, yeah, dog, yeah.
[212:52.88]No, no, no, no, no.
[212:54.10]Triangle is the dash.
[212:56.14]Although, I would much prefer it on, like, one of the bumpers.
[213:00.72]I've already learned it this way.
[213:01.90]That sucks.
[213:02.78]Oh, well.
[213:06.18]Come on, give me a purple.
[213:07.10]Give me a pink fish.
[213:09.70]You stupid asshole.
[213:11.72]I was down to lose it.
[213:17.00]I said that a while ago, but it's true.
[213:25.31]Why did I learn the whole game like this?
[213:26.59]I could have, like, easily prevented this.
[213:27.85]If I just opened the option menu for five seconds.
[213:40.13]And just hold tight.
[213:43.13]Give him the fountain.
[213:43.79]Give him the fucking booger fountain.

[215:24.85]What the fuck?
[215:29.92]No!
[215:33.04]All of a sudden, we're not going left to right anymore.

[219:52.55]Why can the tentacles hit you?
[219:54.73]Oh, no, it was a white bubble that I, like, it was on my body.
[219:58.41]Oh my god, the fucking amount of things you have to pay attention to.

[220:24.14]You're gonna be on, like, crack to play this game the intended way.
[220:33.19]Sorry, I didn't do my daily dose of crack today.
[220:46.17]Sorry, I didn't know I had to snort like Ambien to be able to play Cuphead.
[220:52.35]Whatever the fuck is with the people who fucked up drugs?
[221:00.58]That was almost a disaster.
[221:10.06]Okay, safe.

[221:19.61]You should have been dead.
[221:20.45]You should have died.

[222:43.25]This game is a ton of fun.
[222:44.60]I, like, love this game.
[222:45.66]But man, you got small doses.
[222:49.84]This is one of those small dose games.
[222:54.79]I can feel the right side of my brain, like, screaming for help.
[223:08.47]Nice, like, fucking crush dash.
[223:10.27]Oh my god, shut up, Jared.
[223:11.79]You know, I gotta go.
[223:13.07]I think this is it.
[223:14.25]I think this is where it ends.
[223:16.37]I was making a mustache joke, and I called the guy, and I said, nice crush dash, and it wasn't, like, who cares?
[223:20.96]Just fucking get to the end.
[223:22.10]I'm at the end.

[224:25.54]What in the name of fucking God was that shit?
[224:27.70]Man, he's back!
[224:50.09]Why does he still have a hitbox if he's dead?
[224:53.46]What?
[224:53.72]I'm so... I'm trying to lose my brain power.
[225:01.92]Lobsters are immortal, apparently.
[225:05.38]Alright, this is the last solid attempt.
[225:07.40]Then I gotta rest my brain.
[225:08.78]I'll try one more boss.
[225:10.64]Just to take a look at it.
[225:13.11]And then I gotta get on a plane in like fucking four hours.
[225:17.17]No, what time is it?
[225:17.95]I don't even know what time it is.
[225:19.05]Alright, get over here.
[225:38.19]Come back up here.
[225:47.36]I love this game.
[225:47.98]Like, I would be getting so much more angry at this game.
[225:52.08]But, like, I'm... I'm making mistakes, right?
[225:55.52]Like, it's not a... Hold on.
[225:58.44]Hold on.
[225:59.04]I gotta deal with the fucking impossible to kill lobster man for a second.
[226:02.18]Hold on.
[226:02.48]Like, I know I'm making these mistakes.
[226:10.78]But I also, like, sometimes... Sometimes shit just gets a little fucked up, right?
[226:21.67]Don't die on me again.
[226:24.77]Don't die on me.
[226:28.31]Don't you die on me.
[226:34.80]He's dead.
[226:36.32]I got three HP points.
[226:39.36]Almost didn't make that jump.
[226:41.18]I'm gonna coin.
[226:44.31]I think this is where shit gets all fucked up for me.
[226:55.20]Okay, here we go.
[227:25.34]Where are you supposed to go?
[227:26.40]Where are you supposed to go?
[227:36.65]What did I miss?
[227:37.63]What's over there?
[227:38.27]What did I miss?
[227:39.71]Where?
[227:41.94]The cannon?
[227:42.52]There's a cannon?
[227:53.64]I have to shoot the cannon?
[227:55.20]What kind?
[228:08.41]I can beat it.
[228:09.23]I can do it.
[228:10.55]I thought that's how you made him move.
[228:12.85]Guys, remember, I'm like, I've been paying attention to not get hit by all the shrimps.
[228:17.01]And all the spraying, like, fucking vinegar.
[228:21.79]I haven't been paying attention to the cannonball coming out of his mouth.
[228:24.63]I've been paying attention to not getting hit by the shrimp.
[228:28.15]That's a task on its own.
[228:33.99]Do you see how many shrimps pop out?
[228:37.69]Hey, hey, hey, hey, who ordered the popcorn chicken?
[228:41.88]You know what I mean?
[228:44.58]That's what it's like for me.
[228:45.94]Who ordered the jumbo popcorn trip?
[228:47.44]Not me.
[228:58.32]Do the fucking backstroke, you dick.
[229:03.74]I need to sleep.
[229:04.48]I'm alright.
[229:05.00]I'm fine.
[229:06.67]Mostly messing around.
[229:08.55]For the most part.
[229:15.27]There he is.
[229:15.71]Come on.
[229:15.97]Is that the first time he said a voice line?
[229:31.55]Alright.
[229:33.03]Easy, boys.
[229:34.11]Easy, boys and girls.
[229:48.14]Good.
[229:48.34]There we go.
[229:53.87]Just don't fuck it up again.
[230:04.13]Okay.
[230:05.09]He breaks icebergs.
[230:24.62]Where's this last iceberg?
[230:28.10]Okay.
[230:28.32]It's broken.
[230:29.10]It's broken.
[230:30.45]Get me out of here.
[230:44.70]they like to roll the
[231:09.54]Plain level.
[231:10.44]We're gonna go against this mermaid lady.
[231:14.46]Here's the mermaid lady.
[231:17.75]Watch out for the turtle.
[231:26.33]This is what we call extreme.
[231:28.41]Does that slow you down?
[231:33.65]That doesn't hurt you, right?
[231:37.16]No, it doesn't.
[231:37.58]That doesn't hurt.
[231:47.08]I'm dead.
[231:49.78]This one's not that long.
[231:52.30]It's all about, like, being little.
[232:05.55]Ah.
[232:06.71]Honestly, like, what...
[232:08.77]What are you supposed to do there?
[232:10.19]Fly through them before they die?
[232:14.55]You gotta fly through those before they do that.
[232:16.97]That's the only way I can see how that's possible.
[232:20.33]This fucking turtle just fucks everything up.
[232:22.67]Yep.
[232:23.23]Holy shit.
[232:32.03]Let's try staying all the way back here.
[232:37.84]I gotta hit her in the face.
[232:38.70]Okay.
[232:44.27]Got a different electricity.
[232:45.75]Okay, yep.
[232:55.79]Here comes the dumb horse.
[233:07.02]I don't think I... I think I can kill him, but... Oh, boy.
[233:23.41]I'm, like, losing frames here.
[233:24.77]Holy shit.
[233:32.71]What's going on here?
[233:36.68]Now she turned into Medusa?
[233:38.86]Whoa!
[233:46.08]Can I avoid that?
[233:47.74]Wow!
[233:53.48]Wow.
[233:54.74]Oh, boy.
[233:56.24]Okay.
[233:56.78]Well, that's interesting.
[233:57.96]Very cool.
[233:58.68]I like it.
[234:10.26]I hate this horse.
[234:10.90]Die.
[234:12.72]And that's what I get.
[234:13.44]Like, honestly, that's what I deserve.
[234:15.86]I like, give me this more often.
[234:33.66]I can just stand here.
[234:34.70]I'm fine.
[234:41.59]I'm so... I like that so much better.
[234:44.20]Give me that over and over again.
[234:45.30]You know what I'm saying?
[234:48.26]Not that I hate this guy.
[234:51.48]I'm going to stay small right now.
[234:52.70]Because, honest to God, that's a recipe for a disaster.
[234:56.30]Okay, this is where it gets tricky.
[235:02.41]Whatever it is, I might have to.
[235:06.79]Whoops-a-daisy!
[235:07.69]There it goes, and then they go...
[235:12.11]Alright, I'm halfway there.
[235:13.99]Full health.
[235:14.93]And I have my invincibility.
[235:19.42]You gotta wiggle around like a fucking psycho.
[235:24.48]Fuck me.
[235:39.79]Oh, boy.
[235:40.45]Now she's got a floating head, and we're going into this zone.
[235:43.15]Oh, come on.
[235:43.95]I don't... Oh, what the fuck?
[235:48.49]It's a different fucking special move.
[235:49.92]What an idiot.
[235:57.16]Oh!
[235:57.38]Oh!
[236:15.16]Holy shit.
[236:26.35]I got a C. C. C. Screamer.
[236:30.99]Oh well.
[236:35.16]Time for a... Well, I have to beat that fucking stupid fish level first.
[236:38.90]Come back!
[236:43.29]Calamaria.
[236:44.85]Calamaria.
[236:46.27]No.
[236:46.73]No.
[236:47.13]No.
[236:47.29]I have to beat this.
[236:48.61]I can't let this level beat me.
[236:53.43]I'm gonna... I gotta get... I have to.
[236:55.04]I have to beat this.
[236:56.74]Don't... I can't let it win.
[236:59.66]I won't be able to sleep, guys, if I don't beat this level.
[237:10.67]How many, like, how many gross expletives have I said tonight, by the way?
[237:14.86]More so than usual?
[237:18.32]I have to beat it.
[237:19.40]It's so important.
[237:29.36]I'm so fucking, like, dying.
[237:33.88]I'm good, though.
[237:34.40]I'm alright.
[237:35.18]I got one more in me here.
[237:37.04]Oh, you...
[237:41.78]I don't know what it is with the bee in this level, seriously, filling my fucking underwear with shit.
[237:51.36]That bee boss and this together have, there's like probably nine pounds of shit in my underwear right now.
[237:58.90]Just sitting there.
[238:00.14]It's been there since fucking like nine o'clock.
[238:09.12]I can imagine this game with two people is probably so... Alright, yeah, I got gamer fatigue, guys.
[238:22.80]That's what it is, gamer fatigue.
[238:24.00]I'm going to coin that phrase right now.
[238:26.00]Gamer fatigue.
[238:27.56]That's what it is.
[238:28.10]I'm going to go to the doctor and he's going to be like, well, hold on a second.
[238:32.06]You got to be like 60, 70% of the way through Cuphead.
[238:35.85]And you're starting to feel a little bit weird.
[238:37.81]You're talking about, like, shitting in your pants, and you said you're gonna, like, rub your ass in somebody's face.
[238:41.99]That's gamer fatigue.
[238:43.13]And you're having trouble seeing?
[238:44.73]Let me prescribe you a couple of things.
[238:46.75]I'm gonna prescribe you 10 cc's of hot chocolate and 20 cc's of warm milk right before you go to bed.
[239:03.97]And begin!
[239:08.54]I love it though, this is great.
[239:11.44]I've been like really frustrated and really like angry at certain parts, but it's... It's fun though.
[239:16.38]It's not... It's not frustrating to... No, it is.
[239:19.81]But that's okay, because you get good, you know what I mean?
[239:23.45]Isn't that what everybody says?
[239:24.89]Get good.
[239:30.37]It's gonna give me some hot chocolate.
[239:36.08]Yeah, it's prescribed.
[239:38.39]You know they have, like, Tylenol and they have prescription strength Tylenol?
[239:42.29]Well, I'm gonna get prescription strength hot chocolate.
[239:46.21]Gotta get it at the pharmacy.
[239:47.45]Yeah, good.
[239:48.21]Come on, bring it back.
[239:49.49]Bring it back, Mr. Lobster.
[240:09.24]I almost got hit by the dumb, angry starfish.
[240:11.92]That would have been such a disaster.
[240:15.56]That was lucky.
[240:23.12]This is the last attempt, no matter what.
[240:25.64]No matter what, this is the last attempt.
[240:26.94]And then I gotta get on a plane.
[240:28.10]I gotta go to... I gotta get on a plane.
[240:29.94]Gotta get on a plane.
[240:32.84]I do have some stuff... I got something to talk about, though.
[240:36.10]Before we stop the stream, I have something to tell you guys.
[240:39.59]It's pretty important stuff.
[240:41.97]Stick around.
[240:44.83]Stick around.
[240:50.61]Can't spell fun without fuck this game.
[240:55.43]I have full health.
[240:57.43]Just don't blow it.
[240:58.65]You're right here.
[240:59.65]Why would you blow this?
[241:03.56]Last attempt.
[241:05.30]I'm gonna get out.
[241:20.61]Where am I?
[241:23.11]Where am I?
[241:54.78]I just like, I just woke up in like a fucking box underground.
[241:59.16]You know what I mean?
[242:02.81]Like, I just, I just like, that's the reaction you have if you, somebody chlorofoams you.
[242:08.07]Right, I got chlorofoamed, I got stuffed in a box and buried.
[242:10.83]And I just woke up.
[242:12.70]That's like the reaction that you have.
[242:14.34]That was not an appropriate reaction.
[242:16.94]What year is it?
[242:28.63]The island.
[242:31.47]Yeah, that was like a I woke up and there's like a bunch of scary shit around me.
[242:39.30]Where am I?
[242:40.58]What have you done with me?
[242:41.90]What have you done with my son?
[242:43.06]Alright.
[242:47.93]Holy shit.
[242:48.85]I don't, like, typically scream like that, man.
[242:52.63]Do I?
[242:52.99]I don't.
[242:53.27]I don't.
[242:53.73]I don't, like, scream.
[242:56.57]I almost died, like, five fucking times in a point two seconds.
[243:06.26]Oh, screaming.
[243:07.26]And I'm sorry.
[243:07.86]I don't like to scream like that because it's, like, it hurts people's ears and it's, like, annoying and loud.
[243:13.36]I've been doing that all stream.
[243:14.58]I know.
[243:14.86]I'm so sorry.
[243:19.47]I screamed, not like that.
[243:20.47]Yeah, that was like, that was like, that was like somebody was hurting me scream.
[243:26.69]Streamer found dead after playing Cuphead.
[243:29.00]Alright, what about, what's the theater?
[243:32.46]Well, we got a minute here.
[243:36.44]Dramatic finale, hold on.
[243:38.54]We got one more.
[243:40.46]I'm so steamed, I never want to hear Ludwig say, less is more again.
[243:43.88]It's common sense that more is more.
[243:47.74]He doesn't know the first thing about fine music.
[243:50.36]And if you waste your time talking to him, neither will you.
[243:57.81]I'm going to give it a try.
[244:06.38]Alright, we can parry that.
[244:09.68]Okay, well.
[244:14.46]Not too bad.
[244:15.52]Not too bad so far.
[244:16.28]You turned into...
[244:21.16]I'm just trying it.
[244:21.88]I'm just trying it.
[244:22.60]You know what I mean?
[244:25.18]I'm just trying.
[244:25.70]Look, I'm just giving... I'm just trying the level.
[244:28.72]I'm gonna miss my plane.
[244:30.98]What if I, like, just stayed up and, like, missed my plane?
[244:45.47]Cool.
[244:46.63]What does that do?
[244:47.09]It's still there.
[244:49.02]That thing's freaking me out.
[244:49.70]What does that do?
[244:51.12]I can't, like, touch that.
[245:01.48]Oh, shit.
[245:02.72]Bad news.
[245:06.06]I was up on the Cupid, and I didn't fucking even know you could do that.
[245:19.60]What you doing?
[245:20.40]Phase 2.
[245:22.18]You gonna call in the guy?
[245:23.26]That guy coming in?
[245:24.68]He's in the car.

[246:25.51]She's like clay-nation now.
[246:28.33]What is this?
[246:29.69]What's the wave?
[246:30.27]I don't know what this does!
[246:32.09]I had to jump over the wave.
[246:47.92]Okay, alright, I could dash through it maybe I might be a little too big for that I Didn't have a good setup for that we're gonna do we're gonna do a setup I'm gonna do a setup with like a good setup.
[247:10.60]I mean, I just I just want to try it.
[247:12.68]I
[247:16.18]Jeremy, go to bed.
[247:17.14]This is your mother speaking.
[247:19.44]This is your mother, Jeremy.
[247:35.04]What did I... I just bumped my head on the... I bumped my head on the fucking ceiling.
[248:04.73]I'm this far through into the game, and I still don't have... I still don't have another, uh... Okay, but this is the killing much faster.
[248:14.50]I like this.
[248:15.12]Gotta be careful.
[248:23.16]Watch out for the babies!
[248:34.83]Fucking babies.
[248:35.49]Fuck, holding down that button at the same time is gonna cause me problems.
[248:46.57]No, I got back here again.
[248:47.75]This is definitely the thing to use.
[248:51.40]I'm gonna just, I'm gonna tank it and just kill it.
[248:57.48]Like this.
[249:07.24]Oh, no.
[249:07.88]Why did I stop?
[249:12.44]What are you doing?
[249:13.92]What have you done?
[249:15.70]Just like that.
[249:17.12]Just like that.
[249:17.84]What a good job.
[249:18.58]That was too soon.
[249:19.72]I get it.
[249:20.20]See, that was like 80% of the way there.
[249:22.06]I get it.
[249:23.12]I get it.
[249:23.62]I'll get it.
[249:25.12]Last one.
[249:25.62]We're going to beat this in the last one.
[249:26.87]That's it.
[249:27.13]And we ended on a good one.
[249:37.66]I don't like how that was... Okay, good.
[249:38.96]We're already here.
[249:39.54]Already at second phase.
[249:40.36]Keep it up.
[249:41.87]Keep it up.
[249:42.45]Keep it sexy.
[249:50.61]You know what I mean?
[249:56.32]The rats.
[249:56.82]Got it.
[250:09.77]Almost.
[250:10.80]Okay.
[250:12.30]I got two lives here.
[250:13.76]Make it count.
[250:14.46]Here we go.
[250:24.96]Perfect.
[250:29.19]What do you got?
[250:31.57]Lightning.
[250:36.29]That's not it.
[250:52.58]Get the fuck out of here!
[250:54.98]Get the fuck out of here, lady!
[250:59.15]Get out of here!
[251:01.87]Oh!
[251:13.65]Let's go take a look at the shop.
[251:15.77]I gotta stop playing, man.
[251:16.75]I gotta go.
[251:17.11]I gotta... I gotta C-A-P.
[251:20.23]Catch a plane.
[251:27.71]Let's see what we got.
[251:30.79]More unlocks.
[251:31.49]Oh, I'm so... I'm too addicted to this game.
[251:33.93]Sally's Stageplay.
[251:38.44]Let's at least, like, look at some stuff.
[251:41.73]There's so many other things.
[251:42.75]Alright, let's do this.
[251:43.41]I can't stop.
[251:46.92]I can't stop.
[251:52.00]Heart.
[251:54.96]I don't know.
[251:55.42]Maybe... I'm having too much fun.
[252:00.01]Ugh.
[252:11.00]I got it.
[252:11.60]Coffee.
[252:13.59]Super Mater continuously fills in addition to what you earn.
[252:26.85]Check in.
[252:27.63]Cheetos.
[252:28.11]Okay, what do we got?
[252:36.29]Adds an additional hit point but lightly weakens your attack power.
[252:39.39]Smoke bomb or super meter continuously fills.
[252:44.11]I like that.
[252:45.53]But I don't get... I've been using this the whole game.
[252:51.31]That's going to be hard for me to switch off of that.
[252:56.40]I just want to see.
[252:57.00]I want to see how much it's worth.
[253:03.00]Dash is just like...
[253:06.00]Dash is just too good.
[253:13.03]Well, okay.
[253:14.55]So there's no... There are no iframes with this dodge, right?
[253:18.83]Is that what I'm understanding?
[253:20.27]Are there any iframes in the middle there?
[253:22.69]I've been so... My muscle memory for this game is all about that dash.
[253:34.84]I didn't know he was going to do that.
[253:48.81]I'll come here.
[253:49.62]Don't touch it Don't touch it Long I blow it
[254:11.45]I blew it.
[254:12.65]Don't blow it.
[254:15.15]I'm good.
[254:15.71]Jesus.
[254:18.63]Another last super of the game.
[254:23.03]Thank goodness you came by.
[254:24.07]Those lousy ghosts and me, but good that time.
[254:29.34]Oh, what?
[254:30.54]Here's the last magical super art I was able to find for you.
[254:33.14]Well, time for me to take a powder.
[254:34.62]Goodbye.
[254:35.18]Time for me to go to the bathroom.
[254:37.30]Bye.
[254:41.73]Nah, it's only 11 o'clock.
[254:45.39]We got time.
[254:47.51]What is the final super of the game?
[254:54.15]Giant Ghost.
[254:55.07]Maneuver your spirit body... Maneuver your spirit and body simultaneously for maximum damage.
[255:04.07]What?
[255:07.68]To be honest, fellows, shall we?
[255:09.24]There is a class of grade A people, and then there is, well, everyone else.
[255:13.30]At the moment, you seem like everyone else.
[255:15.27]And that means you cannot experience the world in the special way I do.
[255:18.05]Well, way to be a dick about it.
[255:25.69]Marine Corps.
[255:31.21]Oh boy.
[255:33.31]Alright, so let's just see what I got here.
[255:36.09]Can of soup.
[255:39.45]Carry those middle ones So it's just charging charging to a degree that's like any good Okay, you have to just okay.
[255:49.10]I gotta you gotta jump on those Alright, let's see what this does
[256:05.61]What?
[256:06.99]Okay, what?
[256:09.78]Confusing.
[256:11.54]Confusing.
[256:15.58]I'm not sure what the hell that was doing.
[256:17.04]What are we looking in here?
[256:31.17]That's hard to time.
[256:32.35]I gotta get that timing right.
[256:35.68]Can I shoot the eye?
[256:36.64]No.
[256:39.91]This one is louder than all the others.
[256:41.31]It takes a long time for him to do it.
[256:49.60]What?
[256:49.94]Oh, shit.
[256:50.50]No, it's the ground.
[256:51.36]They're hitting the ground and the flame's touching the ground.
[256:53.10]I just want to see what the enemy does.
[257:05.22]Tom and Jerry.
[257:08.25]That last attempt and then I'm going to bed.
[257:22.24]Still don't understand that super though and it's probably gonna get me killed.
[257:27.02]Okay, here we go.
[257:27.64]I gotta be ready for it.
[257:28.36]Here it comes.
[257:31.26]I got it.
[257:31.76]Okay.
[257:33.30]That was the last pixel I could have done that with.
[257:40.45]What's happening here?
[257:41.29]I'm not sure, though.
[257:42.89]What is all this?
[257:56.78]That super is fucking... No.
[258:00.06]No way.
[258:02.28]That super has... No.
[258:05.13]No.
[258:07.61]It's whatever direction you're facing, use the analog to move him around.
[258:13.37]You use the analog and you left... Uh-uh.
[258:16.45]Alright, it's bedtime.
[258:21.54]How can I see... Can I see my percentage?
[258:23.46]Like, how close I am?
[258:24.34]Like, how far I am in the game?
[258:27.40]Where did I see that before?
[258:28.20]Where was, like, the percentage completion thing?
[258:32.05]I'm probably at about 80%.
[258:32.63]Go to the title menu?
[258:40.59]Yeah.
[258:41.99]Alright, so... Let's just go back to the title.
[258:48.81]Whew!
[258:52.03]Studio M-D-H-R.
[258:53.98]M-H-D-R.
[258:54.84]75%.
[258:58.16]So I've been playing for just over like four hours and 15 minutes?
[259:06.78]Four hours and 20 minutes?
[259:09.60]So what's four hours?
[259:10.64]What's like four hours divided by, you know, like 25%?
[259:13.47]Like one more hour?
[259:14.33]Yeah.
[259:21.64]So there's probably like another hour left in the game.
[259:27.38]Maybe like an hour or two.
[259:32.80]So it's like a five to seven hour game.
[259:36.11]Like six to seven hour game.
[259:42.51]That's okay.
[259:44.83]I'm not...
[259:48.06]Finish it?
[259:48.54]No, I got to get ready.
[259:50.48]I got to pack.
[259:51.70]And let's talk about that.
[259:54.18]Let's talk about some stuff here.
[259:56.30]It's like wonderful music in the background.
[259:59.92]Beat it now.
[260:00.64]I can't.
[260:01.88]I got to like pack and get on.
[260:03.54]I got to get on a plane in the morning.
[260:07.10]I would say if you got 20 bucks, this is fantastic.
[260:14.08]It's fucking wonderful.
[260:17.26]It's frustrating.
[260:18.12]It's gritty.
[260:19.54]It hurts.
[260:20.73]It makes you say awful things like I was saying earlier.
[260:24.43]But, yes.
[260:26.25]I would highly recommend you buy this game.
[260:27.91]If you got the cash lying around, support the studio.
[260:30.33]Because even though it is like a six-hour experience, six to like eight-hour experience, it took a lot of time to do this.
[260:39.19]It's like one of the most stylish, fun, new ideas to come out in a long time.
[260:45.48]So...
[260:47.73]Didn't pack the day before.
[260:50.03]No, it's not that I didn't.
[260:51.73]You know, sometimes I don't want to forget my toothbrush.
[260:55.21]Anyways, I'm going to be in Los Angeles this weekend.
[260:59.48]I'm going out.
[261:00.86]A company is flying me out.
[261:04.82]And we're going to talk business.
[261:06.78]So I may or may not have some type of fairly large announcement for you guys soon.
[261:14.46]I don't know.
[261:15.46]But this trip this weekend is to go talk business.
[261:20.37]So that's the... That's the business.
[261:25.75]No, I'm not going to work for Nickelodeon.
[261:32.27]I finished my book.
[261:33.47]No.
[261:35.26]Sell-out incoming?
[261:36.40]Absolutely not.
[261:37.08]That was a part of my demands.
[261:39.68]I have a list of demands, by the way.
[261:40.95]I could show it to you.
[261:44.11]So, there's a lot of interesting things that might be happening.
[261:52.22]Is it Nickelodeon in Florida?
[261:53.82]No, they closed that place forever.
[261:56.48]Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, they like bulldozed that place.
[262:01.33]And put up a Starbucks and a Walmart.
[262:03.74]That don't exist no more, unfortunately.
[262:14.00]Nickelodeon Studios.
[262:16.76]But, no.
[262:18.48]I'm not sure I can really talk about it right now.
[262:20.66]But maybe after this weekend when I come back.
[262:22.62]There's no stream on Tuesday.
[262:24.08]Because I'll be gone until Tuesday.
[262:28.43]So no streams on Tuesday.
[262:30.83]I'll probably stream Thursday, Friday, Saturday of this next week incoming.
[262:36.69]Obviously, we'll complete Cuphead because it's awesome.
[262:40.18]And after beating Cuphead, we'll probably... There's a lot of options.
[262:46.18]So we'll beat Cuphead on Thursday.
[262:48.18]And from there, we'll see what we want to do.
[262:52.26]But it's definitely something I'm looking forward to.
[262:54.01]Thank you, everybody, by the way, for watching.
[262:56.55]If you're just checking the stream out for the first time, hi.
[263:00.41]Or if you're a regular, hey, well, welcome back.
[263:04.71]Much love.
[263:05.45]Hopefully you enjoyed the stream, and if you didn't, then I'm sorry, I got a lot to work on.
[263:09.14]I gotta be better.
[263:10.52]I could be better than that.
[263:11.38]I could have fucking beat that fish level, like, the second try, and it took me, like, 19 tries.
[263:18.04]But thank you for the support.
[263:20.04]Thank you for sticking around.
[263:21.76]Hopefully I have some news for you guys soon.
[263:23.72]And it does have to do with like video stuff.
[263:28.26]That's really pretty much it.
[263:29.60]And I don't know if it's real or it's not real.
[263:31.58]It's becoming more real because I'm getting flown to California to talk about it.
[263:34.88]So we'll find out.
[263:39.60]So next Thursday is the next time you'll probably see me like one week from today.
[263:43.70]Well, no, six days from today.
[263:47.28]Because if I come back, I might be too tired and jet-lagged and everything to stream the next, like, you know, it depends on when I get back on Tuesday.
[263:54.04]Or I might be coming in on Wednesday.
[263:55.22]I'm not sure.
[263:57.35]But good night.
[263:59.37]Goodbye.
[264:00.61]Much love, everybody.
[264:04.27]Don't lose my personality.
[264:05.81]That's not going to happen.
[264:07.35]Look, if there's something I can promise you guys, regardless of anything that happens, whether it's like a production or a company, I...
[264:16.65]I'm gonna do what I like want to do and if they don't want me to do that if they're like if it said quote potential business opportunity doesn't want me to do that I'm not gonna do it you know what I mean it's just not going to happen I promise I 100% fucking promise
[264:41.62]gonna absorb Adam Sandler.
[264:43.53]Yeah, every year Adam Sandler consumes the soul of somebody.
[264:47.09]And that's how he keeps making these movies.
[264:49.55]I'm going there to be a blood sacrifice for Adam Sandler.
[264:52.91]It's weird.
[264:53.25]Everybody gets like, you go down to like a basement.
[264:56.93]They're all holding like weird silver knives.
[265:02.40]But, goodbye.
[265:04.12]Good night, everybody.
[265:04.92]I'll see you on Thursday.
[265:06.94]At the very latest, at the very least, right?
[265:09.34]We'll beat Cuphead.
[265:10.78]Go get it.
[265:11.50]Game's fucking awesome.
[265:14.62]And I will bid you all adieu.
[265:16.62]Let me check the bits, make sure I didn't miss anything.
[265:18.74]Mostly lost, thanks for the $1 here.
[265:20.30]This will probably pay for an ice cube or something in the airport.
[265:22.44]Well, thank you.
[265:22.98]I appreciate it.
[265:24.24]Thanks for the ice cube.
[265:27.03]Not even.
[265:28.15]Like, you're talking about probably $5 for an ice cube at the airport.
[265:31.51]That's such horse shit.
[265:33.01]Fucking $7.50 for a water.
[265:36.11]What kind of ship are they running over there?
[265:38.65]It's like the movie theater times 10.
[265:41.99]Before I go, what the fuck is that, by the way?
[265:44.57]When you walk into a movie theater, all of a sudden, everything in price increased by 500%.
[265:50.93]Why?
[265:51.23]What?
[265:52.52]Why is that okay?
[265:53.40]Why is that, like, legal?
[265:55.82]Why is that okay?
[265:58.35]Hey, this is a small soda, uh, you know, out the door here.
[266:02.41]Literally, if you walk out of the movie theater door and walk 10 feet to the convenience store, this drink is four and a half dollars less expensive.
[266:11.94]Why?
[266:12.78]What?
[266:18.49]They can't answer that question.
[266:19.59]It's bullshit.
[266:20.07]I used to work in a movie theater.
[266:21.31]It's how they get most of their money, but like, what?
[266:24.62]Like, who thought of that idea?
[266:26.38]The guy that, like, first made the first movie theater was just sitting there, like, one day.
[266:29.40]You know, we're showing these movies, but what if we charged 50 fucking times more money for all the stuff that you could buy, like, popcorn and... You know, hey, hey, hey, Jerry, what's the cheapest fucking snack that ever has existed?
[266:44.16]That would be peanut butter and popcorn.
[266:46.78]Popcorn.
[266:47.30]That's the one.
[266:47.98]It's like 13 cents to pop two pounds of popcorn.
[266:51.91]Sell it for six bucks.
[266:54.53]It's the first of a microtransactions.
[266:56.15]Are you kidding me?
[267:03.27]Anyways.
[267:03.65]Good night, everybody.
[267:07.29]I will see you Thursday.
[267:08.98]Goodbye.
[267:09.88]Much love.
[267:29.62]Hold on, before I go, what was that?
[267:30.90]Somebody just, like, bought Cuphead?
[267:33.06]Why did it say I made a sale?
[267:34.60]What did I do?
[267:36.77]Somebody, like, bought the Cuphead through the Twitch thing?
[267:41.19]Well, thanks, whoever that was.
[267:43.27]I hope you enjoy the game.
[267:46.33]Good night.
[267:46.69]Thank you.
[267:47.31]Bye.
