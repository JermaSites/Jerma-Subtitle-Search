[00:00.17]We good?
[00:00.49]Alright, it's time for us to do the greatest video game of all time.
[00:05.79]Tier list.
[00:08.60]This is gonna, oh my god, this is gonna take a while.
[00:12.94]And I'm too red!
[00:14.10]This is gonna take all fucking, I just was looking for some stuff to do real quick.
[00:22.59]Take a long time.
[00:25.79]That better?
[00:26.15]That's better.
[00:28.24]Alright, let's start with... Okay, so this is the best game that I've ever played, right?
[00:34.57]He's played like five games on this list.
[00:36.59]More than that, at least eight or ten.
[00:44.37]What actually have I played?
[00:45.31]Alright, let me get the ones that I'm certain of.
[00:50.25]Alright, Team Fortress 2 is a masterpiece.
[00:54.75]It goes up here.
[00:58.26]What else is on here that's an absolute masterpiece?
[01:01.30]That I know for a fact is up at absolute masterpiece level.
[01:06.14]Resident Evil 4?
[01:07.42]Resident Evil 4 is up here pretty close.
[01:09.69]I wouldn't say the whole way.
[01:11.83]I'm not done with this yet.
[01:13.21]We're going to go to great.
[01:16.75]Um... Battlefield 1.
[01:22.12]I don't think that's... I don't know if that should be on here.
[01:26.14]Battlefield 1?
[01:32.63]On the greatest video games ever made list.
[01:40.97]Okay, but if every single game on here could be the greatest game ever made, they're not necessarily horrible games, are they?
[01:47.24]I'm going to keep it here.
[01:52.44]It's going to go down.
[01:55.08]Okay, XCOM 2.
[01:57.18]I had never played it.
[02:00.35]Oh, shit.
[02:01.09]Smite's on here.
[02:02.25]Why is Smite on here?
[02:05.09]Alright, but here, I'm going to be fair.
[02:06.41]It's a Smite.
[02:07.01]I think Smite's more fun than Battlefield 1.
[02:09.80]I am certain of that.
[02:19.76]Which one is this?
[02:20.30]Is it Smash Bros.
[02:21.14]Brawl or just Smash Bros.
[02:23.31]in general?
[02:24.33]I think that's Brawl.
[02:27.45]Hold on.
[02:27.87]I just gotta get this situated.
[02:31.01]I don't want to say Warframe is horrible, but I don't think it's the best game ever made.
[02:33.97]I don't want it to be horrible, though.
[02:44.86]Okay, alright, let me ask you this.
[02:46.66]If I have less than, like, two to three hours in the game, should it be under have not tried the game?
[02:56.66]Because if I have less than five hours in the game, they're going down here.
[03:01.29]I don't even think it's hard.
[03:02.23]Okay, I'm just going to leave it here.
[03:04.97]No.
[03:05.55]I think it's better than Battlefield 1.
[03:07.13]I think everything's better than Battlefield 1 for me.
[03:08.99]I don't think there's anything on this list that's worse than Battlefield 1 for me.
[03:14.66]We'll find out.
[03:15.28]This is very early.
[03:17.14]This is League of Legends.
[03:18.20]I don't play it.
[03:19.88]That's going to be at the bottom.
[03:22.22]God of War 2.
[03:24.56]I never played it.
[03:26.45]Fallout New Vegas.
[03:33.71]I know people are gonna... This is... Right now, I am just making myself out to be the ultimate hated person.
[03:42.28]This is more... This is way different than doing cereal box tier lists.
[03:47.79]If Fallout New Vegas is not on Masterpiece...
[03:53.39]I think a lot of you are going to be very adamant that I'm... You're going to want to, like, be mad at me.
[04:05.56]I'm scared to put that in here.
[04:06.92]This is... Okay, this... Should I do an on-stream one and an off-stream one and then tweet out the comparison?
[04:13.54]Oh yeah, a Fallout New Vegas SR.
[04:15.44]It's definitely an A-plus tier.
[04:16.98]On-stream Andy.
[04:18.54]And then off-stream it's like down here.
[04:22.22]No, I'm going to do this real.
[04:26.86]This is for real.
[04:27.78]This is what I actually really believe.
[04:29.22]I'm not going to have anybody fucking tell me what I... I'm not going to have you influence me at all.
[04:34.51]I think Smite is more fun than Fallout New Vegas.
[04:36.49]I admit it.
[04:37.73]I'm sorry.
[04:38.17]Everyone's going to be mad at that.
[04:39.07]But, like, I've had more fun playing... I don't know.
[04:41.63]I just think it is.
[04:42.83]I like that video game.
[04:45.91]But this... But is it, though... Maybe.
[04:48.90]On stream, off stream.
[04:54.15]Hold on.
[04:54.75]I gotta get more up here.
[04:55.57]Until Dawn should not be on this list.
[04:58.51]Why?
[05:00.79]Half-Life 2 is also not gonna be as high as people want it to be.
[05:06.15]I don't consider Half-Life 2 to be, like, up at Masterpiece.
[05:12.01]It's great.
[05:13.87]It also made me very sick.
[05:15.29]I don't know why.
[05:15.71]The boat level in Half-Life 2, when you're in the boat...
[05:20.77]I had to stop playing every... Oh, this is Half-Life 1.
[05:23.85]Okay, well, hold on, hold on.
[05:24.99]It still belongs up here.
[05:26.53]Half-Life 1, you... Idiot!
[05:29.29]Alright, Half-Life... Is Half-Life 1 more fun than Smite?
[05:36.68]Careful.
[05:38.20]Careful.
[05:44.36]Uh, Castlevania?
[05:45.22]I don't... I don't... I didn't play the one for PlayStation.
[05:48.78]I'm sorry.
[05:50.06]BioShock 1.
[05:51.14]BioShock 1 was very good.
[06:02.81]It's not better.
[06:03.53]It might be better than Half-Life.
[06:06.27]Oh, my God.
[06:07.03]People are going to hate me.
[06:09.77]But that's kind of not fair, though, because it's like years later.
[06:22.03]Jerma, stop.
[06:23.79]Faced.
[06:25.49]It doesn't matter.
[06:26.07]It doesn't matter.
[06:26.57]Alright, well, I'm going to hold on.
[06:28.33]Once I get it to where I want it, then I'll be alright.
[06:30.81]This is Crash Team Racing?
[06:33.65]I don't know what that is, but I didn't play it.
[06:36.15]Uncharted?
[06:36.63]Oh, I've never played an Uncharted game.
[06:38.35]I don't even have one second in them.
[06:39.55]I can't even put them on here.
[06:42.05]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.
[06:43.16]That's not a masterpiece, but it's up here.
[06:47.48]Wait, hold on.
[06:48.48]Am I allowed to put this up here?
[06:49.70]Didn't I talk a ton of shit about this game when I was playing it?
[06:51.73]Wasn't I raging?
[06:52.81]Like constantly being whiny and annoying when I played this for Dreamcast?
[07:02.01]I did, right?
[07:02.85]Okay, then I can't put it up here.
[07:04.92]I just kept complaining over and over again.
[07:08.54]Over and over and over again.
[07:15.00]It's down here.
[07:17.39]Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, that is not good.
[07:22.11]It's not a good game.
[07:24.44]It was fun, but it wasn't good.
[07:34.68]Look, every Call of Duty game can be fun.
[07:37.93]That doesn't mean they're good.
[07:41.17]Like, it's fun.
[07:41.89]I could just sit there and just be on the phone with somebody, just like,
[07:46.45]Yeah, yeah, man.
[07:47.31]Yeah.
[07:48.51]Playing a little bit of Kill Confirmed.
[07:50.69]Yeah, what are you up to?
[07:51.77]Yeah.
[07:58.14]No, I'll be over in like fucking 20 minutes.
[08:00.30]Like, you just don't even fucking care.
[08:02.18]You just like the sound.
[08:04.06]Actually, and this is something I really actually truly believe.
[08:06.84]I believe that the Call of Duty hit sound is the only reason why people play the game.
[08:12.03]I truly believe that.
[08:14.34]That sound effect is what brings everybody in.
[08:18.04]Something about it.
[08:19.68]It's like this... It's this perfect, like, scratching that itch on your back that's right in the middle that sits between your shoulder blades and the middle of your back that you just can't barely get.
[08:30.64]But the second you get your middle finger up there and you... Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[08:39.48]Without that hit sound, that game is a 3.
[08:41.88]With that hit sound, it's about a 7.
[08:43.55]It's a 6.5.
[08:50.23]Dark Souls... Is Dark Souls 1?
[08:52.15]Is Dark Souls 1 better than Smite?
[08:59.10]Yes.
[08:59.92]Of course it is.
[09:01.48]That would be outrageous if I thought otherwise.
[09:05.96]I'm not done with it yet.
[09:07.28]Hold on.
[09:08.40]Don't say masterpiece yet.
[09:10.31]I'm only putting things in masterpiece that I truly can say belong there.
[09:14.37]Like, right off the bat, without even thinking.
[09:20.11]Some of these will move up.
[09:20.91]Just wait.
[09:23.07]I have not played A Hat in Time.
[09:25.55]Red Dead Redemption 2 was very good.
[09:33.57]Was it more fun than Smite?
[09:39.57]Yes.
[09:41.83]Mass Effect 2.
[09:46.21]I didn't.
[09:47.91]Okay.
[09:50.42]I don't like those games.
[09:52.74]Can I say that?
[09:53.76]Is it okay to say?
[10:00.16]I don't like Mass Effect.
[10:02.39]That's okay, right?
[10:04.81]I don't hate Mass Effect.
[10:06.61]I don't think it's a shitty game.
[10:09.13]I just don't like it.
[10:10.82]That's okay.
[10:11.32]I can say that, right?
[10:14.78]That's okay.
[10:15.30]Alright.
[10:15.78]Yeah.
[10:22.18]It's definitely better than Until Dawn.
[10:25.70]But I didn't... I didn't even play it, really.
[10:28.60]I didn't.
[10:30.32]Why are you asking us?
[10:32.79]Because sometimes, if I say I don't, you know, if I said I, that Mass Effect 2, remember, no, Clay, can't clip, can't clip, Clay, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't clip, can't clip.
[10:42.18]If I say Mass Effect 3, can't clip.
[10:43.78]If I say Mass Effect, if I say Mass Effect 2 sucks, then I'll get tweets about it.
[10:48.32]People will be like, fuck you, you're an idiot.
[10:49.58]You don't know anything about video games.
[10:54.78]So I gotta be careful.
[10:58.80]He's being hacked.
[11:00.77]I haven't played it, really, I don't, I'm not into the series.
[11:04.29]Sonic Mania.
[11:08.49]Hmm, it's probably, is it... I kind of feel the same way about Sonic the Hedgehog that I do about Modern Warfare 3, the sound effects.
[11:18.30]Like, I only play Sonic to, like, hold down and go... I don't, I don't really care.
[11:28.11]And for the... And then the... I have trouble playing Sonic the Hedgehog.
[11:47.17]I feel like I have ADHD, and it's hard for me to concentrate on a lot of things.
[11:51.73]So I'll be running very fast, and it's just like...
[11:57.21]And I'll hit like a fucking spike.
[11:58.47]I can't even pay attention to it.
[12:03.75]This is better than smite.
[12:10.24]Of course it is.
[12:14.44]If you guys would like to see the definition of recency bias.
[12:24.04]This is the only video game I've played.
[12:27.99]Offstream.
[12:30.59]In the last six months.
[12:36.74]The only one.
[12:45.93]But it's fun!
[13:00.99]It's better than Warframe.
[13:02.42]It is.
[13:04.26]Alright, hold on.
[13:04.66]Wait, wait, wait.
[13:05.16]What else we got?
[13:06.46]GTA 5.
[13:10.63]It's close.
[13:11.19]I have to come back to this.
[13:12.31]I think GTA 5 is one of the better games to come out in the last at least 10 to 15 years.
[13:21.61]The GTA 5 story is like... Alright, it's alright.
[13:25.36]It was cool.
[13:26.46]But just... Hold on.
[13:28.20]Now that I can give my reason why.
[13:30.82]The world of GTA 5...
[13:34.41]is so, it's just people are alive.
[13:39.30]Just like the pedestrians and the buildings and the mountains and so much time went into that city and that world.
[13:47.12]People have tried to do that since.
[13:49.81]Remember, GTA 5 came out in fucking 2013.
[13:51.95]2013.
[13:51.97]Name me a game that's come out recently
[14:02.88]that really kind of badly wanted to have that same vibe.
[14:08.06]And it was a disaster.
[14:17.13]It better not be on this list.
[14:54.62]What is this doing on here?
[15:01.64]This definitely was made before the game came up.
[15:05.42]This list was created probably like a couple weeks before that game came up.
[15:15.49]The Avengers.
[15:17.56]It's not on here.
[15:18.62]Okay.
[15:19.24]I don't think it's on here.
[15:20.87]Somebody said it's on there, but you don't even know which one I'm talking about.
[15:23.55]But maybe you do.
[15:24.87]Is it on here?
[15:27.63]It's not on here.
[15:28.33]Look at these little icons.
[15:29.91]I can't even see.
[15:35.75]Is it on here?
[15:36.37]It probably is.
[15:38.71]This was probably made before it even came out.
[15:43.28]Bottom left.
[15:58.95]This is the games that I pre-ordered.
[16:01.77]Thinking they were going to be the best game ever made.
[16:03.55]Uh, list.
[16:15.82]Here, this is unfair because I'm, I'm just like, bandwagon jumping Andy.
[16:21.78]Right?
[16:22.12]And I know you're fucking sick of me saying that, but it's, look, that's how, that's how we communicate in this generation.
[16:26.60]We say Andy.
[16:28.97]I haven't played Cyberpunk.
[16:32.44]I just... It's bad because everybody told me it was bad.
[16:37.14]Cyberpunk's bad because everybody told me it was bad.
[16:39.26]And I saw a clip of a car, like, flipping upside down and, like, deleting.
[16:52.73]I can't rate it.
[16:53.37]I can't.
[16:53.74]I didn't play it.
[16:57.88]It sucks.
[16:59.43]It's actually really fun.
[17:00.39]Well, there's two people right next to each other.
[17:02.99]It sucks, but it's fun.
[17:04.21]Alright, so it's like Modern Warfare 3.
[17:06.27]Wait, are there sound effects in this game?
[17:07.69]Is it Modern Warfare 3?
[17:11.57]Like, when I reload the gun, does it go like... So I can just be like... No?
[17:17.94]Okay, then it stays down here.
[17:19.00]I thought this said Bugleberry.
[17:23.48]Bugleberry.
[17:27.98]What is that?
[17:28.38]Jungle Party?
[17:35.34]Is that a good game?
[17:44.39]Is this like a game I've never played?
[17:45.95]Play Jungle Party.
[17:50.08]It belongs there.
[17:50.88]It does?
[17:51.24]I have no idea what it is.
[17:57.28]It's a masterpiece.
[17:58.06]It's a masterpiece.
[17:58.72]It's a masterpiece.
[18:00.29]This is a paid ad to let it be on here.
[18:06.81]It does look like an old cereal box CD that was taped to the back of the box.
[18:14.57]I have no idea what it is.
[18:15.57]Alright.
[18:18.13]Okay.
[18:19.39]I only played the first...
[18:22.15]Four hours or five hours of God of War, the new one.
[18:25.33]But my goodness was it beautiful.
[18:27.55]It was fantastic.
[18:33.49]And I've been told that the first three or four hours of God of War are 10 out of 10.
[18:39.63]But the rest of God of War is like 8.5 out of 10.
[18:42.79]That's what I have been told.
[18:45.33]I heard the first like six hours is like a full 10 out of 10.
[18:48.92]And then the rest is like an 8.6.
[18:52.18]Is that fair?
[19:04.02]You know... I don't play video games.
[19:12.80]All the games on this list, I think I've played like for three to four hours.
[19:25.94]Dota 2, I've played for like three hours.
[19:30.60]Yakuza, I've played for like four hours.
[19:33.44]Street Fighter, I've played probably a total of like two to three hours.
[19:36.80]Halo Reach, I played an hour and ten minutes with Joel.
[19:41.76]Batman Arkham City, I played for like two hours because it was on sale for like the eighth time.
[19:47.22]Watch Dogs, I played for about three hours on stream.
[19:53.52]Star Wars.
[19:54.54]Lego Star Wars.
[19:55.28]Played for about four hours.
[19:57.88]Ooh, Shadow of the Colossus is on here.
[20:00.36]Now that's a great game.
[20:01.22]That's amazing.
[20:05.15]Borderlands 2.
[20:06.85]Is this the good one?
[20:12.95]Jerma, none of them are the good one.
[20:16.17]What the fuck, dude?
[20:16.92]Okay.
[20:31.10]Borderlands series, to me, is Overwatch ultimates for the entirety of the time that you're playing the game.
[20:39.98]That's how I felt.
[20:40.52]I just kind of felt like I was constantly in an ult in Overwatch.
[20:55.15]Holy shit, he's lost it.
[20:58.39]I didn't say it wasn't fun.
[21:05.26]I just remember, like, pressing Q every, like, minute.
[21:08.38]And it was just like... And then I guess we won.
[21:18.92]Everybody in, like, Borderlands, especially the later ones, they have, like, super moves that you can use every minute.
[21:30.13]Get the super moves out of games.
[21:31.69]Can I say that?
[21:34.22]Take ultimate abilities out of fucking video games.
[21:36.34]It makes them annoying.
[21:37.02]It makes them stupid.
[21:37.84]I don't like them.
[21:39.58]I don't like having ultimate abilities that you just press a button and just... And everything dies and you can do it once every minute or two.
[21:48.05]No, let me have to fucking... I want to play.
[21:50.01]I don't want to just press fucking Q and have colors light up the screen.
[21:57.97]That's why Smite deserves to be a little bit higher than it is.
[22:12.54]It's a bad take.
[22:14.34]I don't think it is, though.
[22:17.98]Because it makes it... Look, I know I'm not, like, that good at video games.
[22:22.28]But when you have ultimates in games that just... Just level everything in front of you.
[22:27.83]When you play with more than one or two people, you just... You might as well just be hanging out talking in a Discord call.
[22:34.55]You're not even playing.
[22:36.08]When, like, three of you have a fucking cue button to press every two minutes, you're just hanging out and talking in a call.
[22:43.29]Because, like, alright, let's go in.
[22:44.39]You guys ready to go in?
[22:45.25]Just, like, wipe everything out.
[22:47.25]Oh, we all pressed Q. Alright, like, pick up the items, I guess.
[22:49.93]There's another one.
[22:51.17]There's another fight.
[22:52.43]This one's a boss.
[22:54.92]Everyone, press Q. That's unironically correct.
[23:01.58]Thank you.
[23:04.02]Going off script now.
[23:09.45]Just wait till they add an ultimate in the next Mario game.
[23:13.37]And then everybody can come back here and be like, man, you know, you were kind of right about that.
[23:17.60]Just wait till you press, wait till you press like fucking right bumper in like Mario Odyssey 2.
[23:23.24]And he goes like, and fucking spins and stars go everywhere and like, and everything just fucking dies around him.
[23:33.52]Wait till it happens and then you tell me I was wrong.
[23:42.13]You're a psycho.
[23:44.90]So, I mean, no, I'm not.
[23:49.98]I didn't play Uncharted 3.
[23:52.38]I didn't play fucking Uncharted 2.
[23:54.09]I didn't play fucking Uncharted 1.
[23:55.87]Ooh, this one's good.
[24:04.67]That's very good.
[24:06.42]Whoa, I even said it.
[24:07.40]I have to put it up here.
[24:15.17]Is there a doesn't deserve to be on?
[24:16.99]I guess this is doesn't deserve to be on the list.
[24:19.09]Alright.
[24:20.75]Horrible is not horrible.
[24:22.47]Horrible is doesn't deserve to be on the list.
[24:26.83]That doesn't mean it's a bad game, but when you're talking about the greatest video games of all time, I just don't think they belong on the list.
[24:40.71]You gotta put, like, you gotta put Doom on here somewhere.
[24:42.69]I don't even know where to put it, though.
[24:45.28]I think I played it for, like, wait, this is the remake.
[24:52.62]I played the remake on stream.
[24:56.52]Somebody get the exact time.
[25:00.19]Somebody get the exact time of how long I played Doom.
[25:05.47]Is it more than four and a half hours?
[25:13.68]Four hours.
[25:15.18]It was four hours and 27 minutes.
[25:25.47]No, I'm way more suited to watch movies.
[25:28.47]Coming to this realization.
[25:30.07]If Doom was a movie, I could give you a good review.
[25:37.39]After four hours... Not even TV shows either.
[25:44.45]TV shows last whole seasons and hours and like tens of hours.
[25:48.75]I'm a movie guy, and I'm coming to the realization here.
[25:56.25]Fake Doom fan.
[25:58.47]It was good.
[25:58.91]Hold on, let me just mute so I can get rid of this, whatever is wrong with me.
[26:07.96]That's better.
[26:11.10]Oh, fuck, right.
[26:12.42]Fuck, right.
[26:12.96]Fuck, right for you, dude.
[26:15.36]I didn't... Wait, is this Far Cry 3?
[26:18.66]I played this on stream for four hours.
[26:32.27]I played this one off stream for one hour and uninstalled it.
[26:42.51]Mortal Kombat 11 played it for like two hours, three hours.
[26:46.73]I didn't play Wind Waker.
[26:47.87]I know... I didn't play Breath of the Wild.
[26:51.11]Binding of Isaac goes up high.
[26:55.70]No, I don't know if it's... It's definitely an amazing.
[26:57.94]Definitely.
[27:02.94]Final Fantasy... I don't even know which one it is.
[27:04.73]I didn't play it.
[27:06.03]Watch Dogs 2.
[27:09.07]Both are bad.
[27:10.15]I'm sorry.
[27:10.69]They just are.
[27:12.17]That's what I feel.
[27:13.75]Mario Odyssey.
[27:14.95]I played for like three and a half hours.
[27:26.98]I got to the part where you walk in the... I got to the part where you walk in the pipe thing and it's like a... It was like all nostalgia.
[27:37.30]And then I uninstalled the game.
[27:45.85]Don't ever listen to a thing I say about video games.
[27:49.97]I have no experience.
[27:54.01]I am the best indicator for if you've got a good, if you've got a big first act, a really good first act, you'll know because I'll play the game.
[28:05.86]Everything that's up here, notice how they all have really, really fantastic first acts.
[28:20.61]With the exception of Isaac.
[28:23.25]Isaac and TF2 are... Are you okay?
[28:32.14]Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[28:33.30]Are you alright?
[28:37.24]That was probably really bad.
[28:38.66]I'm really sorry.
[28:39.56]Oh, there's like 16,000 people here.
[28:47.83]I'm really fucking sorry.
[28:49.13]I'm really sorry.
[28:51.20]but these you can do binding you can play you can beat Binding of Isaac technically in 30 minutes 20 minutes TF2 you just jump in a server and just walk around with the flog and just burn people light them on fire and crit them and get them to yell swears at you in chat it's you it's you don't have to do anything you know it literally takes five minutes
[29:16.80]All these have great first acts.
[29:19.28]This is a complete eye-opener.
[29:22.94]I didn't play any of Assassin's Creed's.
[29:30.04]No.
[29:30.64]I don't play FIFA?
[29:32.45]I don't play Fortnite?
[29:34.39]Oh boy.
[29:36.91]What a first act this had.
[29:39.83]the cinematic, the cutscene, getting into Don Moro as a dwarf, getting the voice lines and collecting the stuff and going to meet Anduin Wynne at Stormwind.
[29:54.80]What a first act.
[30:02.00]And don't give me shit for this.
[30:04.58]World of Warcraft...
[30:07.84]not the one that they like resurrected and redid it again no the original one back in like 2004 2005. that was it was really cool it was insane it was unbelievable no one had ever done that before I don't know everquest everquest everquest what about everquest did you play everquest I did and I this was I liked World of Warcraft better than everquest you why
[30:33.94]This is going to be hard a little bit later.
[30:35.48]I knew this was going to take a long time.
[30:36.58]Overcooked 2 should just not be on the list.
[30:38.10]It just shouldn't.
[30:39.86]It's a cool game.
[30:40.40]It's fun.
[30:41.83]But it's not better than Resident Evil 4.
[30:46.15]It's not horrible.
[30:46.81]It just shouldn't be on the list.
[30:47.99]Pac-Man.
[30:48.59]Alright.
[30:53.43]Pac-Man might not be better than Resident Evil 4.
[30:58.27]But it might be more important than Resident Evil 4.
[31:10.93]That doesn't matter?
[31:11.47]What do you mean that doesn't matter?
[31:16.46]How can you compare, like, to the first part, like, the first act of God of War?
[31:32.37]But you have whole generations of technology.
[31:35.97]Of course that matters.
[31:37.17]Yes, it does.
[31:42.41]Only Dark Souls is only very good.
[31:43.87]That's not true.
[31:44.73]I have to get this in the... I have to get it... All of these are within one or two tiers of correctness.
[31:50.85]I need to go and fix it.
[31:52.37]But I need to get them up here first.
[31:57.81]Pac-Man's more important than God of War.
[32:02.55]It just is.
[32:03.51]I could look at that later.
[32:05.51]Metal Gear Rising.
[32:06.41]It was alright.
[32:09.78]It was okay.
[32:10.16]It was fun.
[32:11.86]Metal Gear Solid 3, uh, is that, is that Snake Eater?
[32:15.16]This is the best one.
[32:15.82]This is the best Metal Gear Solid.
[32:18.48]I will die on that hill.
[32:19.62]I think this is the best Metal Gear Solid.
[32:20.90]I think it is.
[32:29.29]Metal Gear Solid 2 was fun, but they had this, like, crazy, like, AI-generated script.
[32:35.10]That you just, they pumped it into your brain over the course of, like, 12 hours.
[32:46.56]I like Metal Gear Solid 3 the best.
[32:48.80]The first one was really good, too.
[32:55.24]That's a great series, though.
[32:56.44]Fantastic series.
[32:57.84]Unbelievable series.
[32:58.78]But I think the third one's probably the best one.
[33:01.40]I didn't play The Last of Us.
[33:03.12]That's a lie.
[33:04.16]I did play The Last of Us.
[33:08.21]Let me make sure I get this correct.
[33:10.34]Let me make sure I get this correct.
[33:11.34]I might have some things missing and misremembering here.
[33:14.60]It was either MLC Stealth or Etalyx.
[33:20.28]The PlayStation had a feature where you could screen share to somebody and they could take control of the controller and play.
[33:27.73]And they did that for me with Last of Us.
[33:30.81]Like 20 minutes.
[33:36.53]That's my entire time I've played
[33:39.60]I might be missing some details there, but it was one of them.
[33:44.66]Yeah.
[33:47.68]Maybe 30 minutes.
[33:52.25]Oh my... Thank God it's on the list I got.
[33:54.63]I was starting to get a little concerned.
[34:00.51]And they've got the remake coming out.
[34:02.61]Please don't fuck that up.
[34:04.81]Please don't fuck that up.
[34:09.34]Please.
[34:09.60]Blizzard, give us one thing.
[34:15.11]Diablo 4 can suck total ass.
[34:19.11]I don't care.
[34:22.49]Don't fuck with that one.
[34:26.17]Don't fuck it up.
[34:29.69]I would rather play this than Diablo 4.
[34:34.99]Oh my god, I didn't even see this.
[34:39.13]Alright.
[34:44.54]What's the absolute masterpiece?
[34:48.64]Where does it go?
[34:52.94]For a second, I was like, I thought this was the Magic School Bus.
[34:55.18]And I was like, this is a TV show.
[34:56.40]Why is it even on here?
[35:01.39]Original Counter-Strike.
[35:03.89]Alright.
[35:04.27]My enjoyment from this game was not very good because I was terrible at it.
[35:07.59]And it just made me angry.
[35:13.57]I hated Counter-Strike because it was terrible.
[35:18.15]Does the game pissed me off factor work here?
[35:24.45]I got so sick and tired of just turning a corner and watching a guy just go like this.
[35:30.30]And I was gone.
[35:31.94]Like, crouch dead!
[35:35.38]I didn't even know what happened.
[35:36.68]And then it's like, okay, I guess I'm going to wait.
[35:38.64]And I don't like the waiting either.
[35:39.66]I don't like waiting around.
[35:43.34]So somebody would just crouch dead, and then I would just be waiting for what?
[35:47.60]No, I don't want to do it.
[35:50.73]No, I just didn't like it.
[36:03.15]I played so much Counter-Strike and had just negative kills to deaths every game.
[36:14.17]It's definitely better than Smite.
[36:18.85]If you were to take a screenshot right here and zoom in and put it, like, I would be an enemy of PC video gaming.
[36:32.14]It's not accurate.
[36:38.92]I don't know if this is it.
[36:39.80]I can clean it up to do it.
[36:41.22]Alright.
[36:42.14]Phantom Pain was very good.
[36:47.13]But did I pretend to like it more than I did to make sure I could have a fifth game in my top games of 2015?
[36:59.92]That's the real question.
[37:01.52]That's the tough one.
[37:02.08]Because I did really like it.
[37:09.17]And by the way, I know I talked about it, but I don't even remember giving the list.
[37:14.63]I woke up in my bed the next day.
[37:16.21]Like, I remember starting that video.
[37:28.54]It's not, no.
[37:29.36]It was decent.
[37:30.20]It was not better than 3.
[37:31.90]Tetris is fucking horrible.
[37:37.59]The game sucks.
[37:40.98]Only smart people put this high.
[37:45.21]Us dumb fucking idiots hate this game and think it's stupid.
[37:49.73]You can tell how smart somebody is how high they put Tetris.
[37:54.83]Tetris, man?
[37:55.95]Amazing.
[37:56.71]I love Tetris.
[37:58.48]I love the equations.
[37:59.66]No, no, no.
[38:00.04]Us idiots hate this game.
[38:15.19]I don't like Tetris, I just, it's... The forward thinking, and what piece do you have next, and like, oh, get the, do the math problem, like, oh, which, can that fit the other, it's like, it's a big, no, too much, too much visual, get it off.
[38:27.47]And there's no blood in this game, so like, eh, eh.
[38:38.04]Sorry.
[38:40.38]I fucking hate Tetris.
[38:46.81]Overwatch is not better than Smite.
[38:52.50]Is Overwatch better than Smite?
[39:15.17]Metal Gear Rising should not be this high.
[39:20.33]Hold on, I'll go back to it.
[39:22.31]Was this Omega Lull?
[39:24.08]I don't play Soul Calibur.
[39:26.08]I have not played any of the Assassin's Creed games besides the first one for guess how much time?
[39:32.16]I'll give you a hint.
[39:33.42]It's not five hours.
[39:34.44]Call of Duty Modern Warfare, the original one.
[39:41.75]I'm one of those posers.
[39:44.79]that started playing Modern Warfare and Call of Duty at Modern Warfare 3.
[39:54.30]Original Doom.
[39:55.08]Original Doom.
[39:56.80]Why am I saying it like that?
[39:57.56]Doom.
[39:58.70]Original Doom.
[40:04.68]This is unfair.
[40:07.90]Because all these old classic video games are just automatically just placed up on this first or second row.
[40:15.12]That's kind of unfair.
[40:15.78]Tetris.
[40:26.67]Tetris is stupid.
[40:29.91]Excuse me.
[40:30.37]Blood.
[40:33.31]Oh, what about, excuse me, Pac-Man dies, and he goes inside out and fucking disintegrates, screaming.
[40:41.22]And you eat fucking people in this game.
[40:42.96]You eat them.
[40:43.60]You crush their bones and stuff with your mouth.
[40:53.44]Arkham, I only played for like three hours on a Steam sale.
[40:57.54]Dark Souls 3.
[41:02.20]Here comes, and here comes the never-ending debate.
[41:04.74]Every one of the, okay, this is the worst part about doing a game like this, a game list like this.
[41:09.90]Every single Dark Souls game not only has to be right next to each other, but in the correct order.
[41:14.86]Or I'm in trouble.
[41:16.98]You can't have this.
[41:17.78]No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls, Sekiro, Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, Dark, with the brackets, they have to be right, it has to be right, no, no, no, no, you're doing it wrong.
[41:34.29]I actually like Dark Souls 3 a lot.
[41:38.17]I don't know if it's... First Act.
[41:45.22]First Act is pretty good.
[41:46.14]What was a better First Act?
[41:49.28]Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2.
[41:50.84]Dark Souls 2 is the worst one.
[41:52.88]I think we can agree on that one.
[41:55.72]All the Mario Karts have been 0 out of 10s since Double Dash.
[42:03.87]Just making a correct statement here.
[42:10.05]After double dash, they all became zeros.
[42:14.11]What is this?
[42:14.85]Life is straight.
[42:15.87]Alright.
[42:16.55]Hold on a minute here.
[42:22.35]I liked this.
[42:22.83]Better than Tetris?
[42:35.02]Is Life is Strange better than Overwatch?
[42:43.42]Hmm.
[42:48.61]Life is Strange is better than... I know you can't say, oh, what?
[42:51.95]Life is Strange is better than Tetris?
[42:54.29]Oh, cringe!
[42:57.14]I don't like Tetris.
[43:03.01]I don't like Tetris.
[43:04.43]I think the game sucks.
[43:07.63]I didn't like Tetris when I was 12.
[43:10.89]I was like 9 years old playing it.
[43:12.67]8 years old on the Nintendo or something.
[43:14.71]On my Game Boy.
[43:15.83]And I remember just being like, this game's fucking stupid.
[43:18.21]I didn't swear.
[43:18.87]But I was like, I hate this.
[43:21.50]I don't like this game.
[43:23.12]Where's Bonk?
[43:24.96]By the way, if Bonk was on here, he'd be up in fucking Masterpiece.
[43:38.97]Bonk was the best Game Boy game.
[43:40.07]And who talks about that?
[43:41.18]Nobody but me.
[43:45.82]Final Fantasy VII.
[43:49.28]The only experience I have with Final Fantasy VII was watching Burger Boy scream at his TV jumping up and down because he couldn't beat the last boss over and over again.
[44:01.57]And this is like 19 years ago.
[44:09.26]And I think he got so mad, I remember, like, he got to the point where he was so mad moving around that he could unplug the controller.
[44:16.63]And that made him even more mad, and he was jumping up and down, like, jumping up and down, controllers out of the port!
[44:24.82]So I'm, and that was my reasoning for never playing this.
[44:29.14]I've never played Final Fantasy VII, I've just seen the final boss and an angry friend.
[44:34.80]So I was like, well, fuck this game, why would I play this?
[44:41.53]That's my only experience.
[44:45.23]But.
[44:47.39]What a great soundtrack.
[44:49.43]And.
[44:49.61]I've seen the movies and they're good.
[44:53.17]The movies were pretty cool.
[44:55.63]Yeah I know.
[44:56.47]I'm the person that didn't.
[44:59.75]I've watched the movies.
[45:02.97]No they're not good.
[45:05.23]They literally aren't.
[45:06.29]The movies aren't good.
[45:10.90]Advent Children.
[45:11.56]Yeah, that's the one I saw.
[45:12.42]That was bad.
[45:13.14]Advent Children.
[45:16.52]Omega Lull.
[45:22.95]He doesn't know.
[45:23.59]Well, I didn't understand anything that was going on, but I like, I like Katsith.
[45:32.21]And I like, I think it's cool.
[45:34.14]But wait, but Katsith Those are terrible.
[45:39.94]The only reason why I wanted to play Metal Gear Solid 7, which was wrong, is because Katzeth has dice.
[45:49.54]And don't you gamble to play?
[45:52.74]He throws dice and it could be anything, right?
[45:56.05]That's cool.
[45:56.87]That's cool.
[45:57.25]I like that character.
[46:01.45]What am I talking about?
[46:02.11]We're talking about Final Fantasy 7.
[46:04.03]What is he saying?
[46:04.91]What?
[46:06.69]Let him enjoy something.
[46:08.01]What?
[46:09.69]Katswith was on screen for five seconds total in Advent Children.
[46:12.29]Yeah, and that's the part where I stood up in the fucking theater and I screamed clapping.
[46:18.74]And me and one other person that thought Katswith was cool, and I pointed at them and I was like, You get it?
[46:26.22]You and I get it!
[46:27.55]Ow, my elbow!
[46:34.24]And then he was like, holy shit, are you okay?
[46:36.59]And he ran over and he like held my elbow and he like wrapped it up.
[46:40.99]And I was like, and then that's, that's how I met exoskeleton bug millennium boy.
[46:50.37]Anyways, uh, inside was good.
[46:51.63]No, no, get this off of really bad.
[47:04.82]I don't like the word bad for these.
[47:15.67]I don't play video games.
[47:19.79]Pokémon Emerald version.
[47:21.65]I don't play it.
[47:25.80]Oh my god.
[47:32.20]I've
[47:34.01]The only experience I have in Super Metroid was renting it from Blockbuster and somebody else's save file being there, right?
[47:47.83]and then opening it and just hearing the and running around and shooting stuff and I had no idea where the fuck I was going because the map is all over the place and you had to have known what you did before to do what you were doing in the future and I didn't want to start at the beginning
[48:05.87]I did that for a lot of games, by the way.
[48:08.21]How many of you guys rented games, like RPGs, especially turn-based RPGs?
[48:13.23]I did this all the time with Earthbound.
[48:15.05]I think I was too stupid to, like, really want to play from the beginning.
[48:20.71]So I would just hope that there would be a save file that was more than halfway through the game, and I'd be like, oh, nice, they're, like, halfway through the game.
[48:27.62]And I would just walk around and fight stuff.
[48:31.46]and just play on somebody else's save that they had on the blockbuster one and just enjoy maybe like 30 minutes and then I would just stop I just wanted to enjoy somebody else's time in the game like I didn't want to start at the beginning you're a fraud exposed that's weird
[48:53.84]Earthbound Street.
[48:55.26]I don't know.
[48:56.70]It was definitely because I didn't get it.
[48:58.30]Like, I wasn't... It didn't... Especially turn-based RPGs.
[49:03.11]They were, like, too slow for me.
[49:05.19]So it would be like, wait, what do I have to do?
[49:06.13]I have to get the stick and equip the stick and then, like, walk over here to the town and buy this and then walk over here and find... No, this is back when pressing A as fast as I could was my skill, my skill set.
[49:19.36]So pressing A as fast as I could was like half of every Super Nintendo game.
[49:24.57]And if that wasn't in a Super Nintendo game, then I might as well have actually sort of returned it to Blockbuster.
[49:28.54]Papers, please.
[49:32.80]This is very good.
[49:35.51]But again, I would always start Papers, Please and get to the point when there was more than three or four things you had to do.
[49:43.49]And that's where I would stop because I couldn't do it.
[49:45.13]It'd be like, okay, I have to check the ID.
[49:47.86]I got to check their work order, where they work and their passport.
[49:50.90]And oh, this is too much.
[49:52.08]I don't want to do it anymore.
[49:56.18]That game is incredible until you get to like the four things on the screen.
[50:02.64]It's very good though.
[50:04.16]It's up here somewhere.
[50:09.84]Outlast 1 I actually really liked.
[50:18.58]But you can't put Outlast in front of Doom, can you?
[50:23.22]We'll see.
[50:24.46]We'll see.
[50:25.17]I'll fix it later.
[50:25.91]Hold on.
[50:26.07]Is it going to get it in the right place?
[50:28.07]Persona.
[50:28.69]I've never played Persona.
[50:29.91]All I know is that I watched somebody play Persona 3 for like 10 minutes.
[50:35.31]And it was a part where they were just shooting themselves in the head with guns.
[50:38.28]And I was like, oh, okay.
[50:40.46]That's how you fight?
[50:43.62]It was like, wow, this is crazy.
[50:47.40]Sekiro is not...
[50:52.64]Sekiro was better than Dark Souls 2, but was lower on the list for Dark Souls games for me.
[50:59.21]And no, it's not Dark Souls.
[51:00.81]I know, I know, I know.
[51:03.17]Didn't play Yakuza 4.
[51:05.81]I've never played a Fire Emblem game.
[51:08.96]GTA 4 probably deserves to go in front of GTA 5 because...
[51:15.08]Technologically speaking, when GTA 4 came out, it was insane and never done before.
[51:20.88]And by the time GTA 5 came out, open world games having that much going on was pretty normal.
[51:27.99]So they kind of started that.
[51:29.25]They did that really first.
[51:30.59]So I think it belongs in front of it.
[51:35.29]Even though the video game might be a little bit worse than GTA 5, like the true, like the engine of the video game.
[51:43.35]I kind of like, I like GTA 4.
[51:47.10]It was more, it was kind of crunchy, you know what I mean?
[51:49.56]It was like crusty in a way.
[51:50.98]I liked it.
[51:51.34]Play Breath of the Wild if you like open world.
[51:57.66]I will one day.
[51:58.34]Apex Legends, I've never played it.
[52:04.25]Wait, the first Walking Dead?
[52:06.97]Telltale game.
[52:11.98]I almost just, like, spoiled everything.
[52:15.90]Um... The Walking Dead Telltale game... Had a few... Really, really... Fantastic moments.
[52:30.57]There was a few... And they were not short.
[52:33.37]They were... They led up to a lot of... There was a couple things in particular.
[52:38.98]That... I was like, oh, that was really cool.
[52:42.78]I don't think it was like, whoa, amazing.
[52:45.48]It's the best game ever.
[52:47.78]It was good.
[52:48.58]I liked it.
[52:48.94]It was good.
[52:53.64]It belongs in the good to very good.
[52:56.76]Was it better than Doom?
[52:57.74]Well, I have to fix that.
[53:03.50]Bread?
[53:05.46]Oh, Devil May Cry.
[53:06.42]No, I haven't played it.
[53:07.56]None of them.
[53:08.36]I have no time in any Devil May Cry.
[53:11.17]Yakuza 0, I've played for like, oh, I know, but I can't rate this because... It's better than Tetris.
[53:22.24]It's better than Life is Strange.
[53:25.28]It's better than Metal Gear Rising.
[53:26.34]Overwatch is worse.
[53:27.98]Overwatch is way worse.
[53:29.72]No, it's not.
[53:31.92]Modern Warfare should not be over here.
[53:34.33]Modern Warfare should actually be down here.
[53:35.91]Like, let's be honest.
[53:49.94]I'm just thinking.
[53:53.41]If Until Dawn is down here, does Life is Strange deserve to be up here?
[53:59.59]I don't think Until Dawn was horrible.
[54:01.69]I don't...
[54:15.74]Honestly, this is cut off at the top.
[54:17.73]I don't even know what Far Cry it is, but it doesn't fucking matter because every single one of them is the same game.
[54:22.97]I have no idea which one this is, but all of them go down here.
[54:27.17]Is it three, four, five?
[54:28.97]I don't know which one it is.
[54:38.10]Okay, Portal 2 and Portal.
[54:42.62]I'm going to make a lot of people upset with this.
[54:45.85]I know, first of all, there is a method to this.
[54:49.77]Hold on.
[54:53.49]Portal 2 was awesome.
[54:55.59]Portal 1 made me almost throw up every time I played it.
[55:00.66]Portal 2 was spread out enough with different stuff in between that I could get over how much I wanted to throw up.
[55:08.53]Portal 1 was just puke, puke, puke, puke, puke, just throw up, puke, puke, puke.
[55:14.22]It was just puzzle, puke, puzzle, puke, puzzle, puke.
[55:17.30]It made me sick.
[55:17.86]The game Portal actually makes me ill.
[55:20.50]Even in Portal 2.
[55:22.62]But Portal 2 was more going on.
[55:25.68]It wasn't just like go in this room and do a puzzle and then lie down on the ground, which I did many times.
[55:31.28]I would complete a level in Portal 2 and be green.
[55:34.93]And then I would lie on the ground where my computer was.
[55:38.59]I would lie on the ground and just wait till it passed.
[55:46.87]And then I would get up and do the next level.
[55:50.69]I couldn't handle it.
[55:52.81]That didn't happen in Portal 2.
[55:54.67]This would be up way higher if it wasn't the way.
[56:00.67]I do think Portal 2 was better than Half-Life 1 just because it's, I don't know, it was newer.
[56:04.56]I liked Cave Johnson.
[56:09.18]Well, life gives you lemons.
[56:10.66]Get some limes and have a Sprite or whatever.
[56:14.12]He's had funny lines.
[56:19.72]Yeah, it belongs up here.
[56:22.11]Maybe even a little higher.
[56:24.97]God of... Put God of... No.
[56:26.42]Put God of War down here.
[56:28.60]You just ruined my night.
[56:36.12]Good.
[56:48.63]No, I'm just kidding.
[56:54.21]Alright, somebody... Can I do this?
[56:56.61]I don't know why.
[56:57.79]I want to, like, make two cams.
[57:00.49]Have one of them be blue and the other one be red.
[57:02.61]And put them right next to each other transparent.
[57:05.15]And, like, give you, like, a 3D show.
[57:10.19]Can I do that?
[57:10.61]Color corrector.
[57:47.36]I need blue.
[57:48.02]Where's blue?
[57:52.58]Wait, color.
[58:08.95]Alright, that's red.
[58:16.65]Let me turn the brightness up.
[58:21.15]Is it gonna work?
[58:29.78]Okay, so there's that one.
[58:39.28]And then I need blue.
[58:53.21]This is going to be 3D!
[59:02.66]Why can't I duplicate it?
[59:07.89]I want to duplicate this and make it blue.
[59:09.79]Why can't I do that?
[59:14.75]Paste duplicate.
[59:15.49]Why not?
[59:17.06]Is it Virtual Boy?
[59:22.59]I don't think I can do a duplicate.
[59:23.61]Yeah, I had this problem before.
[59:24.65]Yeah, because I can only paste a reference.
[59:29.41]I can't paste a duplicate.
[59:31.45]Why?
[59:31.71]That's really annoying.
[59:32.89]Let's do a virtual boy.
[59:43.42]Yeah, I can't.
[59:47.08]Why can't I paste a duplicate?
[59:56.38]Does anyone know how to do this?
[59:57.20]Because I've been trying to do this for years.
[59:59.46]Can I just add another source, which is this camera?
[60:05.36]Or is that not going to work?
[60:08.24]OBS can only take one camera.
[60:11.93]Like hell it can.
[60:15.01]I'll be right back.
[61:02.40]Thank you.
[61:33.58]Sorry, sorry.
[61:34.38]Hold on.
[61:34.85]Hold on.
[61:35.51]This is so fucked up.
[61:47.35]I broke it because I plugged a camera in.
[61:50.97]Hold on.
[62:05.03]You see?
[62:05.31]Alright, this one works.
[62:11.73]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[62:12.61]Here we go, here we go, here we go.
[62:13.73]I got it.
[62:15.13]I should have it.
[62:23.32]This is gonna be fucked up.
[62:24.18]I can't wait.
[62:24.62]Alright, now... I... Almost done.
[62:43.70]You see?
[62:44.02]Alright.
[62:56.31]Here we go.
[63:09.61]They got to be in the same spot.
[63:13.02]This one's focus is fucked up.
[63:17.57]Is there, like, grease on here?
[63:18.63]There was grease on it!
[63:22.55]There was a layer of grease!
[63:26.83]Oh, that's disgusting.
[63:30.66]Okay, here we go.
[63:36.58]This one has to be blue.
[63:46.54]Did it work?
[63:53.07]I'm coming at you in 3D.
[63:58.11]Okay, hold on.
[64:03.77]Oh, by the way, I got to make this, I got to say this real quick.
[64:08.02]This is probably, which camera do I look at?
[64:10.64]This is probably going to hurt your eyes.
[64:12.06]This is probably not going to be, this is probably going to suck to look at.
[64:16.31]So, I just want to make that really clear right now.
[64:18.23]Like, just if you have, like, sensitivity, this is actually probably going to be horrible.
[64:23.68]Okay.
[64:24.34]So, make this, like, you do it a little bit off to the side, right?
[64:27.78]I got to make these close to each other.
[64:29.02]Did I get it?
[64:49.45]Hold on.
[64:54.99]Red needs to be brighter.
[65:07.98]I'm going to throw popcorn in your face.
[65:09.96]Okay.
[65:13.63]Brighter.
[65:13.91]Better?
[65:15.61]Better?
[65:20.72]Alright, here we go.
[65:21.42]It's time for your 3D.
[65:25.18]You ready?
[65:25.60]I'm coming at you.
[65:45.55]I'm coming at you.
[65:49.27]They're off sync?
[65:51.24]Does that matter?
[66:03.99]Coming at you live in 3D!
[66:07.33]Yeah, this is just... You know when you go to the movies, and you go to the 3D movie, and you realize that like halfway through the fucking movie, you really don't want to watch it in 3D anymore?
[66:21.68]And you take the glasses off and you're just like, oh, Batman's like punching the guy.
[66:26.69]And it's just like, and you're just like, I don't, can I, can we just go to the other movie?
[66:35.77]This movie's fucking three hours long of this.
[66:39.52]Hold on, wait, ready?
[66:51.65]Just hit my fucking monitor.
[66:52.79]I'm fine.
[66:54.54]It's not a heal!
[66:55.08]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[66:56.72]I need to...
[67:18.92]Alright, now get your 3D glasses on eventually and watch that.
[67:37.83]I actually think it's probably going to work.
[67:43.15]Okay, I'm fine.
[67:47.73]I think it's going to work.
[67:54.04]Let's go.
[67:57.84]So... More to how?
[68:04.74]I mean... Look at how many are still on here.
[68:13.03]Well, this is the last thing we're doing.
[68:16.31]Except something else.
[68:16.97]I've got something else to show you.
[68:21.78]In fact...
[68:23.40]Why don't we go over this now?
[68:28.59]I have something to show you.
[68:31.41]I came across something very interesting.
[68:37.07]You know, turn this off for a sec.
[68:40.83]So, in my hand here, I've got a little thing.
[68:47.54]Now, it's not Catboy.
[68:50.90]I saw my uncle recently.
[68:54.42]And at a little family thing.
[68:57.15]And he was shit-faced.
[68:59.35]And he told me that he had something.
[69:01.51]A family heirloom.
[69:04.23]That was very important.
[69:07.25]I had no idea what he was talking about.
[69:08.83]I thought, it's not a carrot.
[69:12.51]It's not a carrot.
[69:13.59]It's some kind of important document.
[69:18.21]So, he told me.
[69:20.61]That it was probably worth a lot of money.
[69:22.81]It was grandpa's secret.
[69:26.25]So the curiosity got a hold of me and I said, well, can I see it?
[69:31.71]He said, no.
[69:32.81]He said, you can't.
[69:33.42]It's a fucking secret.
[69:34.60]Remember, he was shit-faced.
[69:35.86]So I said, listen, I'll trade you a trip to McDonald's.
[69:39.94]I'll take you to the drive-thru.
[69:41.92]And he thought about it for a second.
[69:44.98]And he agreed.
[69:47.60]So I got whatever this is.
[69:51.33]Grandpa's Secret.
[69:54.55]And we're going to open it right now.
[69:57.55]Are you ready?
[70:03.07]All it took was a trip to McDonald's.
[70:07.65]What have we got here?
[70:08.71]This is a map.
[70:24.30]A map to what?
[70:28.38]Well, I mean, that's obviously Las Vegas in the background.
[70:32.78]There's a treasure trust in the middle.
[70:38.30]What is it?
[70:38.70]Is it a teaser trailer?
[70:40.30]Teaser is a bit.
[70:44.63]I mean, there's no information on here.
[70:50.75]This is supposed to be Las Vegas.
[70:54.33]Vegas is landlocked.
[70:57.04]I... Grandpa, I... There's no... There ain't no water in Vegas.
[71:03.96]I don't think that's accurate.
[71:06.68]Anyhow... I'm gonna get some experts involved and I'm gonna see if I can figure out what the fuck this is.
[71:14.71]Because there's very obviously something here...
[71:21.78]I see, first of all, I see a hamburger up here.
[71:27.64]Maybe we can get some delicious food.
[71:31.25]I think I'm going to look into this.
[71:33.55]I'm going to look into that.
[71:38.09]Hey, drunk Uncle Frank, you may have made the biggest mistake of your life.
[71:45.56]Because I'm going to get whatever the fuck that is.
[71:51.10]Forgot about the wink.
[71:55.82]Why are you so red?
[71:56.72]Probably because of this.
[72:00.55]I'm wearing like two, three layers.
[72:04.67]Porn acting.
[72:05.31]I've been that guy for a fucking year.
[72:18.78]Hold on.
[72:19.16]Let's redo it.
[72:26.21]A TREASURE!
[72:30.87]I just, like, fucked up my neck.
[72:35.45]I just pogged too much and I just put a kink in my neck.
[72:43.47]Ow!
[72:46.19]Holy shit, that fucking hurts.
[72:50.63]Hold on, hold on.
[72:51.69]Hold on, hold on.
[72:52.53]It hurts.
[72:53.89]Alright, we're good.
[72:59.65]We're gonna figure out what this means.
[73:04.73]Very, very, very soon.
[73:06.97]I'm gonna go do some exploring.
[73:09.79]I need to find out what that is.
[73:10.81]What is your porn acting?
[73:17.21]My fucking neck hurts.
[73:20.49]That was a YouTuber acting?
[73:29.08]Oh, what did I do?
[73:33.64]What did I do to myself?
[73:35.44]I pogged so hard that I just like, it was like, I'm going to take a bath.
[73:45.93]That's the hardest I've ever pogged on camera for sure.
[73:49.07]Alright, let's, let's go.
[73:55.79]You know, you know, you know, I'm thinking, you know what I'm thinking?
[73:58.57]You know what I'm thinking?
[74:00.17]I'm thinking a good, I'm thinking Saturday afternoon sounds like a really good time to go maybe look for this.
[74:13.12]That's what I'm thinking.
[74:17.22]And if I were to give a time on Saturday that I would be doing that and exploring and trying to find Grandpa's secret, whatever it is, gosh, I would probably put the sus at 1 p.m.
[74:30.41]Pacific on Saturday.
[74:33.81]This Saturday.
[74:34.35]That's what I would do.
[74:40.58]What is it?
[74:40.92]Nobody Cares?
[74:56.29]Get out of here.
[74:58.09]Alright, Mario 2.
[74:59.07]I always put Mario 2 in really bad.
[75:05.20]Alright, there are too many games on this list.
[75:15.88]There are way too many games on this list.
[75:18.78]I can't do this.
[75:22.97]Dead Rising 2 was awesome.
[75:24.41]But was it better than Dead Rising 1?
[75:26.41]Although I complained every single time I played it.
[75:30.29]I didn't play Deus Ex.
[75:32.14]I... Where was... I played Bully.
[75:39.90]I don't remember how good Bully was.
[75:41.58]I remember being... I remember it was good.
[75:48.81]I think it belongs up here.
[75:52.08]Super Mario Galaxy 2.
[75:53.30]I didn't even play one second of it.
[75:55.74]Shadow of War belongs up here.
[75:59.49]Somewhere in good.
[76:00.77]I'll fix it.
[76:02.01]Crash Bandicoot.
[76:03.91]I never played it.
[76:04.69]None of them.
[76:05.13]All three of them I didn't.
[76:06.17]I just saw the demos at like the GameStop.
[76:08.23]I remember watching people play them.
[76:10.15]The one that's like two minutes long.
[76:11.82]Only the PlayStation disk.
[76:12.76]I never played them.
[76:15.32]Mario Galaxy.
[76:16.18]This is really good.
[76:23.04]That goes up in Amazing.
[76:24.22]It's very, very good.
[76:25.80]Probably the best Mario game that I've played in probably the last 10 to 15 years.
[76:31.56]I didn't play Factorio.
[76:32.94]Is this Superman?
[76:36.08]I don't know what it is.
[76:38.81]What is that?
[76:39.57]Is this one of the... I don't think I played that Monster Hunter.
[76:43.45]I didn't play the Indiana Jones one.
[76:44.75]I played Lego Star Wars.
[76:46.91]But, I mean, it was alright.
[76:49.23]It was decent.
[76:50.89]Yeah, but it was probably not better than Portal, though.
[76:54.61]Maybe.
[76:58.46]I've never played Roblox.
[76:59.72]I played this.
[77:00.48]This is the Super Nintendo Zelda, right?
[77:03.78]That belongs up in great.
[77:09.48]Can we just... Can these be free spaces?
[77:15.32]Is this Ocarina of Time?
[77:17.65]Oh, okay.
[77:18.95]These have to be free spaces, like Bingo.
[77:22.07]You can't... Listen.
[77:24.26]You can't put on the greatest video games of all time list Zelda under good.
[77:32.16]These are free spaces.
[77:33.92]Zelda, Pac-Man, and Doom are free spaces up in Amazing.
[77:40.38]Yes, you can.
[77:40.86]It sucks.
[77:41.48]It does not suck.
[77:45.70]Uh, Resident Evil 7.
[77:49.12]The first act was amazing.
[77:50.80]The rest of the game was not very good.
[77:54.00]I'm gonna put it down here.
[77:58.68]Terraria.
[78:00.95]I... I just don't... I'm not a... I just don't... I'm just not a big fan of Terraria.
[78:04.91]It was... I played it.
[78:05.93]I beat the game.
[78:06.53]Me and Ster played it.
[78:08.94]But it was alright.
[78:11.06]I don't really like... Listen.
[78:14.22]How do I word this without having a rock go through the window right now?
[78:17.66]I like Terraria.
[78:19.84]I think it's a really cool game.
[78:21.05]I just don't like the way it plays.
[78:23.43]I just don't like the side-scrolling.
[78:31.69]It's fun.
[78:32.15]I just gave myself watering eyes from that.
[78:40.25]Play what?
[78:40.75]I'm going to sneeze.
[78:43.85]Am I?
[78:47.69]It's coming.
[78:51.70]Rocket League?
[78:52.54]No, I don't play it.
[78:54.32]Skyrim?
[78:55.22]I played for four hours.
[78:58.26]Three and a half hours were making monsters.
[79:00.20]So, nope.
[79:01.36]The Witcher 3?
[79:02.30]I never played it.
[79:04.10]Celeste was very... Listen to my voice.
[79:05.86]What's going on?
[79:07.64]Celeste was very good.
[79:10.01]Would I put Celeste somewhere over here?
[79:17.79]Where do I put it?
[79:34.40]I didn't even play Doom 2016.
[79:36.10]I did for like three hours.
[79:38.48]Why is it even up here?
[79:47.29]Where do I put the games that I've only played for four hours?
[79:51.51]Where do I put them?
[79:55.43]I can't say, oh, wow, it's like, it's one of the best games ever when you play it for three hours.
[80:03.47]It's going down here.
[80:05.57]Make a new tier and call it Four Hour Andy.
[80:09.60]Okay, let's make a new tier.
[80:12.38]Uh...
[80:15.43]Add a row below.
[80:16.39]Okay.
[80:17.49]There we go.
[80:25.31]Okay, four.
[80:25.91]There you go.
[80:30.05]And that can be just like, I don't know, grayed out.
[80:34.86]A lot of games are going up here.
[80:42.38]Oh, my God.
[80:43.30]So many games are going to be on here.
[80:52.73]What actually... No, I haven't played Fortnite for more than ten minutes.
[81:09.02]This is so bad.
[81:12.26]What else have I played for four hours?
[81:15.72]No?
[81:16.48]No Batman?
[81:18.99]Modern Warfare, the original.
[81:20.63]Maybe, because I downloaded it one day because I wanted to try it.
[81:25.31]That's good.
[81:25.67]What about up here?
[81:27.57]Battlefield 1 is a four-hour indie.
[81:30.91]Mario Kart 8.
[81:32.78]I'm going to put it four-hour.
[81:35.26]Last of Us.
[81:37.10]Watch Dogs.
[81:37.62]Watch Dogs 2.
[81:42.54]I want to go to bed so bad.
[81:47.34]Four-hour fart.
[81:56.07]I've seen a lot of trans pride and I got to make something really clear.
[82:03.41]Please, for the love of God, I support LGBT rights.
[82:11.55]Full stop.
[82:12.19]That's a full stop.
[82:13.91]And sometimes you look over and you see people very, very upset about that.
[82:22.98]And I just got to say, I got to make it clear again.
[82:27.14]I don't want to see any like awful shit.
[82:31.56]And we've seen, I'm going to be honest with you.
[82:33.31]I've seen some really awful shit in this chat about that.
[82:38.31]And there's the idea that what about the spam?
[82:41.53]Spam is always taken care of.
[82:44.23]We have a rule for spam.
[82:46.23]So there's no reason.
[82:49.93]There's no reason at all to, if you see the trans pride emote, to automatically start to just throw awful shit into this chat.
[83:01.81]Spam will be taken care of.
[83:03.91]Please, for the love of God, don't be such an asshole.
[83:07.55]Because I hate to say it.
[83:08.86]I really do.
[83:09.98]But I've seen stuff in this chat that does not make me happy.
[83:16.12]So let me make that really clear.
[83:21.26]I have to.
[83:22.64]Because... What about... Thank you.
[83:29.36]Well... I'll be honest.
[83:36.02]It's...
[83:37.73]It's hard to talk about on stream because for some reason there is a percentage of people that just really, really hate the fact that it's talked about.
[83:47.97]And I got to make that really clear that I, wherever you stand socially, politically, it doesn't matter.
[83:56.73]I don't bring that shit here.
[83:58.95]Don't bring that negative shit here.
[84:00.97]I don't want to see it.
[84:03.07]And if I do, I'm going to be, it's going to be taken care of.
[84:05.49]It just is.
[84:12.10]don't have to explain yourself well sometimes you do sometimes I do there you go that's I want to make that clear get back to the get back to this yeah we will it was a good transition from the fart joke
[84:49.84]Is that how?
[84:50.94]That's not what happened?
[84:53.96]That's not what happened.
[84:59.88]Yes, it is.
[85:00.98]No, it's not.
[85:01.78]What fart joke?
[85:02.52]I didn't make a fart joke.
[85:10.88]Four hour fart.
[85:13.01]Oh, I did say that right before.

[85:55.70]Like, hey, I'm on twitch.tv.
[85:57.06]You see the shirt?
[86:01.76]Like this isn't a doc.
[86:02.64]I don't have to wear like the lab coat.

[86:53.66]Wait, it's a four-hour game.
[86:56.60]Oh, okay.
[86:58.25]It was alright.
[86:59.07]I liked it.
[87:00.99]Monster Hunter: World?
[87:03.93]I remember streaming Monster Hunter: World with Etalyx and getting so angry at the game that I never played it again.
[87:10.47]So I'm going to say four-hour, Andy.
[87:12.77]That's a lie.
[87:13.27]I beat the whole thing with Etalyx off stream.
[87:15.73]I thought it was alright.

[95:55.70]I got to stream.
[95:58.28]This is insane.
[96:00.70]This is over a thousand gifted subs.
[96:06.36]Thank you, everybody.
[96:07.62]This is unbelievable amount of subscriptions.
[96:13.08]That's over 1,000 community subs.
[96:14.70]That's fucking crazy.
[96:18.30]Hopefully, I can put Warcraft 3 in the right spot.
[96:22.76]Otherwise, I'm going to lose subs.
[96:26.67]Thank you, guys.
[96:27.19]Really.
[96:28.23]It's completely unnecessary.
[96:31.31]Thank you, nonetheless.
[96:32.77]Hopefully, I can use your money wisely.
[96:38.30]Thank you.
[96:43.21]Among Us Andy.
[96:44.81]Time that person off for 10 seconds.
[96:46.45]Because then they'll have a full 10 seconds to really go over what they did wrong.
[96:53.92]Warcraft 3 was amazing.
[96:55.16]If it longs up here, it does.
[96:57.90]Not the remake, the original one.
[96:59.40]I think it deserves to be up there.
[97:04.25]Battlefront 2, never played it.
[97:05.87]Street Fighter 2, I've watched people at the arcade play it, but I never played it.
[97:11.61]Second Son, never played it.
[97:12.65]The Spider-Man game, that should be up here under good.
[97:16.35]That's under good.
[97:16.98]Path of Exile, this is a 4-hour Andy.
[97:24.50]Dishonored, that's a 4-hour Andy.

[97:31.34]Didn't play the Dragon Ball game.
[97:33.34]Minecraft.
[97:35.02]Do I put Minecraft in... I don't think I put Minecraft in Masterpiece.
[97:41.69]I think it goes under Great.
[97:44.63]High Great.
[97:47.53]Doom 2016 is not... Seriously, why is it even up here?
[97:51.61]It belongs down here.
[97:53.11]Spider-Man belongs probably up here under Very Good.
[97:57.52]I really liked that Spider-Man game.
[97:58.70]It was really good.
[98:00.90]Spec Ops The Line.
[98:01.90]I didn't play it.

[98:11.48]Gmail?
[98:13.20]What is that?
[98:15.56]Oh, that's Gary's mod.
[98:19.51]That's Gary's mod.
[98:23.09]Is Gary's mod really like a masterpiece of a video game or is it like a cool toolbox?
[98:38.26]It's good, but I don't know.
[98:39.80]It doesn't belong high that far either.
[98:43.92]SUPERHOT.
[98:44.57]The original SUPERHOT was cool.
[98:45.71]SUPERHOT VR was better.
[98:46.77]It's not on here, which is disappointing.
[98:49.37]Mordhau's not really bad.
[98:52.01]It was good.
[98:52.89]It wasn't better than Portal.
[98:59.50]Civilization.
[99:00.16]Didn't play any of the Civilization.
[99:01.66]Spore.
[99:04.56]Spore's going to go up to good.
[99:09.28]Fallout 4, that's 4-hour Andy.
[99:12.94]Maybe 6-hour Andy.
[99:15.78]What just went in my eye?
[99:22.12]Super Seducer on greatest games of all time?
[99:25.09]Why?
[99:25.41]I never played it, but why?
[99:27.55]This is another Far Cry.
[99:30.61]Who knows what it is?
[99:31.35]It could be one I played.
[99:32.19]I don't care.
[99:32.63]It just belongs down here.
[99:33.87]I may as well have never played it.
[99:36.63]Far Cry 5 is 4-hour Andy.
[99:41.03]Guitar Hero... Is this a mobile game?
[99:44.01]It's like a Facebook game.
[99:44.93]Hotline Miami.
[99:49.10]This goes up to good.
[99:50.94]Actually, very good.
[99:53.58]No, I'm going to keep it at good.
[99:56.80]That is a mobile... It's a Facebook game.
[100:00.42]Fallout 76.
[100:01.30]I don't... Why would I ever play this?
[100:04.16]Is this Pong?
[100:04.91]Pong?
[100:09.35]Pong is definitely a 4-hour indie.
[100:10.89]I have probably played it three times.
[100:14.61]Yeah, absolutely.
[100:19.09]I didn't play Deus Ex.
[100:20.55]Didn't play Dishonored 2.
[100:22.53]I played For Honor.
[100:23.47]That's also for four hours.
[100:26.67]Metro 2033, I played the whole thing, and I did like it, but I don't think it was that great.
[100:33.04]No, I'm thinking of the next one.
[100:34.42]I liked 2033.
[100:34.74]I actually really liked 2033.
[100:36.70]It was great.
[100:44.13]SpaceX?
[100:44.95]Yeah, I didn't play it.
[100:46.97]This is Persona.
[100:47.73]I've never played it.
[100:48.41]Didn't play.
[100:49.17]Wait, no.
[100:49.71]Yeah, I did.
[100:52.52]Back in like 2013 or something.
[100:55.08]Wii Sports?
[101:00.30]It was good.
[101:01.40]I don't even know what that is.
[101:07.82]Guitar Hero 3 is 4-hour, Andy.
[101:10.57]I may have, like, in college or something, played it once.
[101:13.81]Twice, maybe.
[101:17.01]Rock Band.
[101:17.47]I played Rock Band a lot.
[101:18.99]Not Guitar Hero 3.
[101:21.77]Stalker.
[101:23.49]I streamed it for 4 hours.
[101:25.81]Ooh, Cuphead.
[101:27.87]Cuphead belongs up here.
[101:30.89]Probably up at Very Good.
[101:34.54]When's the DLC come up for Cuphead?
[101:45.24]Never.
[101:47.55]Oh, no.
[101:48.07]What?
[101:51.51]It wasn't bad news or anything, was there?
[101:53.75]Postal 3?
[101:54.39]One of the greatest games ever.
[101:58.58]4-Hour Andy?
[102:00.62]Sniper Elite 3, 4-Hour Andy.
[102:02.84]Undertale.
[102:03.48]Uh-oh.
[102:09.78]See, some of you took a screenshot when I was doing this.
[102:12.34]Like, when I was moving this up and scrolling.
[102:13.90]Screenshot!
[102:14.92]So you can, like, link it to somebody that you know loves that game and now they hate me.
[102:21.56]It's up here somewhere.
[102:27.59]Shadow, that's way too high.
[102:29.19]Shadow of the Colossus has to go further down.
[102:36.31]I'm okay with this so far.
[102:37.61]But maybe not.
[102:41.29]We'll see.
[102:44.95]This is a Fallout wallpaper for your computer, for desktop.
[102:48.43]I don't know which one it is, so I'm going to say I don't know.
[102:52.21]No, it's four hours.
[102:53.57]It's probably Fallout 3.
[102:55.54]Wait, no, I played Fallout 3 on stream for... Yeah, four hours.
[103:00.90]Six hours maybe total.
[103:03.42]I never played a Pokémon game before.
[103:06.44]Does it count before hour, Andy, if I tried to stream it, but it didn't work and I tried to play it?
[103:10.20]Not really.
[103:12.45]Logic 2.
[103:14.09]Never played it.
[103:16.39]Which Hitman is this?
[103:22.16]Belongs up here somewhere.
[103:23.22]I'll figure it out later.
[103:26.44]Something Play 2?
[103:28.50]Just Dance?
[103:29.32]No.
[103:32.46]Counter-Strike Source is just going to go right next to Counter-Strike.
[103:39.53]One slot above because it has better graphics.
[103:45.18]That's Counter-Strike Go.
[103:48.06]Oh.
[103:48.55]Well, whatever.
[103:49.35]Doesn't matter.
[103:52.11]Dead by Daylight.
[103:52.81]Have never played it.
[103:54.07]I actually played and beat this whole game.
[103:57.03]And I had one incredibly major complaint.
[104:01.40]The DuckTales remake was good.
[104:02.74]The music was great.
[104:04.12]It was awesome reimagining.
[104:06.44]There were way too many cutscenes.
[104:09.56]There's a cutscene every other screen in this game.
[104:14.85]It was like, just let me play the fucking game.
[104:17.21]It was like cutscene, cutscene, cutscene, cutscene in like the remake of DuckTales the game.
[104:22.34]There's too many cutscenes.
[104:31.02]It was decent.
[104:36.68]Why is Tetris in bed?
[104:39.74]Because I hate that game.
[104:43.57]In fact, it's going now because you just reminded me to rethink why I put it here.
[104:48.65]I hate Tetris.
[104:52.55]I do not like it.
[104:53.89]I hate this game.
[104:57.87]Tetris 99 came out, and what a cool idea for such a dumb, stupid, horrible, shitty video game.
[105:05.80]And then they came out with the Super Mario one, and that one was really good.
[105:13.40]I'm sorry.
[105:13.94]I know people... Some of you probably really like this Tetris.
[105:16.38]And it's... I just hate it.
[105:18.08]I hate it.
[105:18.40]I've always hated it.
[105:21.26]And it's because I'm not good at it.
[105:23.50]I'm not good enough to play it.
[105:24.90]To be good at it.
[105:26.20]And that angers me.
[105:27.23]And it makes me not like it.
[105:28.85]So... Take that as you will.
[105:31.25]Mad because bad.
[105:32.03]That's... Yes.
[105:33.85]Yes, mad because I... I hate Tetris because I'm not good at it.
[105:39.57]At least it's better than the Avengers game.
[105:49.09]Don't you feel like the Avengers game was a dream you had?
[105:51.25]Wow, the Avengers game, so hyped up for the Avengers.
[105:56.56]Like, that's the dream where, like, you think it's real, but the thing, it wasn't real.
[106:01.52]Wow, how awesome would it be to have a never-ending, like, action-adventure, like, kind of... You... Watch words!
[106:13.50]an action-adventure game where you play as the Avengers, and you go and fight stuff, and it doesn't end, and it's like a game-as-a-service kind of thing, and they keep adding stuff, and there's, like, boss fights, there's, like, multiplayer.
[106:26.97]We've wanted that for so long, Morty.
[106:28.95]We've wanted that for so long, Morty.
[106:30.51]And, yeah, yeah, I know.
[106:33.30]But I feel like I dreamt that, and then it didn't exist.
[106:41.37]Hold on.
[106:42.41]Somebody just said this.
[106:44.06]Is Genshin Impact a better Marvel Avengers game?
[106:49.96]It is, right?
[106:50.52]It has to be.
[106:54.94]Huh.
[106:57.17]I would love to play it.
[107:00.97]First time I downloaded Genshin Impact on my iPad, I got a black screen.
[107:05.89]I could walk around with the character, but the entire environment was black.
[107:09.51]Couldn't play it.
[107:10.45]Uninstalled it.
[107:11.85]Two or three fucking months later, I go back and I reinstall it.
[107:16.25]This time, I can't even get to the actual main menu of the video game.
[107:23.84]I sure would have loved to have played it on my iPad.
[107:28.04]So I uninstalled it again.
[107:29.52]So maybe like another two or three months after they do some more bug fixes on the iPad version, I'll try it again.
[107:36.81]I'm not going to play it on PC.
[107:39.45]No, I want to lie in bed and just run around and hit stuff until I pick up loot cases and stuff.
[107:46.89]I don't want to play that on PC.
[107:48.27]That's not a PC game to me.
[107:50.63]That's a, like, in the bath game to me.
[107:54.87]That's a, like, sprinkle in some bath salts and, like, light a candle and just play Genshin Impact for, like, 30 minutes.
[108:03.02]And then get out of the bath.
[108:05.63]That's not a PC game for me.
[108:10.83]You're a crackhead.
[108:14.83]Stop getting sidetracked on the most random shit.
[108:21.45]Take every stream I've ever done, and pull out the times I get sidetracked, and if it's less than 60% of everything I've ever recorded, you win.
[108:35.21]If getting sidetracked is not at least 60%, then you win.
[108:41.23]I don't know.
[108:42.05]You don't really win anything.
[108:42.97]You win knowing that you were right.
[108:49.20]No, don't triple the debt.
[108:50.24]No.
[108:53.56]Plants vs. Zombies.
[108:54.46]This is the first one, so it belongs up here.
[108:59.18]The second one, I would love to just, like, snotrocket it out of existence on here.
[109:04.72]It better not be even on here.
[109:08.00]Mountain Blade Warband.
[109:09.78]You know where that goes.
[109:13.32]Last of Us Part II.
[109:14.20]Didn't play it.
[109:16.18]Journey.
[109:16.58]Didn't play it.
[109:19.04]Um, this is... This is Nier.
[109:21.84]Didn't play it.
[109:24.17]Kingdom Hearts 3.
[109:25.05]Didn't play it.
[109:25.89]Rainbow Six Siege.
[109:27.13]Four hour, Andy.
[109:29.76]Death Stranding, didn't play it.
[109:30.96]Animal Crossing, poor Howard Handy.
[109:37.04]System Shock 2, never played it.
[109:38.57]Divinity, never played it.
[109:39.77]Dying Light was okay.
[109:44.27]I wouldn't put it in best game ever.
[109:47.31]Untitled Goose Game was better than Dying Light for me.
[109:51.20]It belongs somewhere up here into good.
[109:54.08]We'll figure that out in a minute.
[109:56.10]Oblivion.
[109:59.54]I streamed it like two or three times for what?
[110:01.10]Three, four hours each?
[110:02.78]That's not four hour Andy.
[110:03.74]It was alright.
[110:06.16]I had fun.
[110:11.13]I can't believe this is even on here.
[110:12.51]It's like, honestly, I'm... Four hour Andy.
[110:15.79]Yeah.
[110:18.03]Dawn of War 1?
[110:19.13]If it's Warhammer 40k Dawn of War, then it belongs up here.
[110:27.53]I loved the original Dawn of War.
[110:30.94]I thought it was fantastic.
[110:32.48]It belongs up here.
[110:33.22]We'll figure it out.
[110:34.70]Turkey sandwich, what?
[110:35.48]Alright, so I've gotten to the point where I haven't played any video games in my whole life and I thought this was the list to choose from.
[110:43.53]No, we're almost done.
[110:46.07]Didn't play Sly Cooper.
[110:47.19]I never played NBA 2K20.
[110:49.97]No Pokémon games ever.
[110:52.16]I never played Persona.
[110:53.74]Never played Grounded.
[110:54.72]I don't even know what this is, so I'm going to say no.
[110:58.16]No More Heroes 2 belongs up here.
[110:59.84]No More Heroes 1 is better.
[111:04.36]In a way.
[111:04.72]Okay.
[111:10.61]Okay.
[111:14.38]Ghost of Tsushima?
[111:15.16]I really wanted to play Ghost of Tsushima.
[111:18.77]Metal Gear Solid.
[111:20.31]Metal Gear Solid is fantastic.
[111:23.11]It's gotta go up to amazing.
[111:27.49]I'll find a place for it in a minute.
[111:28.83]Didn't play Yakuza.
[111:30.23]Didn't play Call of Duty Cold War.
[111:33.40]I didn't play Doom Eternal.
[111:35.14]No Crusader Kings.
[111:36.28]No Bayonetta.
[111:37.84]No Superliminal.
[111:39.54]No Wasteland 3.
[111:40.24]Ooh, Hades.
[111:42.12]Hades.
[111:49.46]This goes into great.
[111:52.12]Where?
[111:52.46]We'll find out.
[111:52.88]I don't know what that is.
[111:56.24]Payday 2 belongs in 4-Hour Andy.
[112:01.37]Half-Life Alyx.
[112:06.77]I talked about this when I beat Half-Life Alyx.
[112:09.23]Half-Life Alyx is better than Half-Life 2.
[112:14.21]And that's recorded now.
[112:21.26]I think it is.
[112:26.48]That's wrong.
[112:27.26]I don't think it is.
[112:30.19]Where is Half-Life 2?
[112:30.79]This is a lie.
[112:41.05]This is a lie.
[112:43.10]This has to be up here because I game on PC.
[112:46.38]It's not true.
[112:50.28]That's not true for me.
[112:53.84]And I have to break out of the deceit and the lying.
[112:58.26]I don't think that Half-Life 2 is like a masterpiece.
[113:05.51]I think Portal 2 is more fun.
[113:07.27]I think I enjoyed Portal 2 more than Half-Life 2.
[113:12.87]I'm sorry.
[113:15.23]I still find it to be very, very good.
[113:16.74]I just...
[113:21.88]I think Half- Alyx is better.
[113:24.28]By a lot.
[113:35.92]I'm calling Gabe?
[113:37.40]Yeah, call him!
[113:39.04]Sure!
[113:40.16]And tell him that the next one in the series was way better than the last one.
[113:45.30]I'm sure he's gonna be really happy!
[113:48.40]Imagine knowing that you tried to live up to Half-Life 2 and somebody said it was better than Half-Life 2.
[113:54.06]He's going to be real fucking happy to hear that.
[113:57.08]He's going to be ecstatic to know that.
[113:59.53]Because they were very concerned about that.
[114:01.33]Like, oh, how do we do another Half-Life?
[114:03.05]Can we live up to Half-Life 2?
[114:04.35]Oh, you guys did?
[114:06.15]I thought it was fantastic.
[114:12.46]Where is it right now?
[114:15.81]That was Game of the Year last year, too.
[114:17.12]That was the best game that came out last year.
[114:19.40]And Hades.
[114:20.40]But Half-Life Alyx is better than Hades.
[114:22.78]This shit wasn't even nominated.
[114:24.82]This wasn't even nominated for Game of the Year.
[114:28.32]And it was the best game that came out last year.
[114:30.51]Are we going to judge things based on how good they were?
[114:32.53]That was like the most fun I had in a video game last year.
[114:47.59]There are some movies that get nominated for awards that are in select theaters.
[114:54.02]So what's the difference?
[114:55.52]VR... VR is expensive.
[115:05.72]Viewers are dropping.
[115:07.32]What do I do?
[115:07.94]Hold on.
[115:09.02]Make noises and make sounds.
[115:11.24]How do I get them to stay?
[115:12.92]I gotta make sounds and make noises.
[115:17.71]Quick, dude.
[115:18.41]Toy, toy, toy.
[115:28.80]I don't know how to do it.
[115:29.52]I broke it.
[115:29.96]I don't know how to do it anymore.
[115:34.72]I think I fucked it up.
[115:40.68]Of course I know how to do it.
[115:46.26]Shovel Knight.
[115:48.63]Didn't play it.
[115:50.33]Not even 4-Hour Andy.
[115:51.21]I think I opened it on Steam.
[115:53.41]And, like, jumped around for, like, 10 minutes or something.
[115:55.71]And then was like, oh, I'll play this later.
[115:56.81]And I played it.
[115:58.35]Don't know what that is.
[115:59.11]Don't know what this is.
[116:00.41]Didn't play the Batman game.
[116:01.51]Hollow Knight.
[116:02.01]That's... That's more than 4-Hour, right?
[116:06.25]I streamed this, like, 2 or 3 times.
[116:13.70]Was this 4-Hours?
[116:16.68]I really liked it.
[116:20.73]The reason why I could never go back to Hollow Knight was because I got halfway through the game and then didn't play it for, what, like four or five months?
[116:29.73]And the game is one of those, you have to remember where everything is.
[116:34.18]This huge map with all the different areas.
[116:36.60]And this one, you have to have the jump.
[116:38.44]You have to have the dash to go over here.
[116:39.94]And I just forgot everything.
[116:41.78]And I would have had to restart the whole game.
[116:43.02]I didn't want to restart the entire game because I already did it.
[116:46.28]And it was like four months ago.
[116:47.82]Maybe I could, maybe I, I don't know.
[116:49.42]Should I restart it?
[116:56.21]I will help you.
[116:58.71]I thought it was really fun.
[117:05.76]Oh, I think it's too late.
[117:07.14]I think it's too late.
[117:08.46]I did like it though.
[117:13.78]I never played it.
[117:15.54]Didn't play it.
[117:18.24]I don't know what that is.
[117:18.94]I think it's Final Fantasy.
[117:20.96]Subnautica.
[117:22.48]You know where that goes.
[117:25.92]Warzone.
[117:26.46]Didn't play it.
[117:27.54]Titanfall.
[117:28.62]God.
[117:29.04]This is Titanfall 2.

[119:30.90]Without the pecans in it.
[119:32.38]S. With pecan.
[119:33.66]I put the pecans in my mouth and I get the ice cream off and I spit it back in the container.
[119:39.19]This is just ice cream.
[119:45.68]Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.
[119:48.23]Alright.
[119:49.07]Done.
[120:16.19]No, peppermint, mint chip is just way better.
[120:21.03]No, it's not done.
[120:26.93]Now it is.
[120:27.18]Done.
[120:28.40]There you go.
[120:34.50]Alright, back to what we were doing.
[120:37.08]Alright, this is important.
[120:37.92]We're going to start from the bottom up.
[120:39.24]So, of all the games that I have only played for four hours...
[120:43.62]What's the one I think is the best?
[120:44.88]Probably Odyssey.
[120:46.46]It's not Dota.
[120:49.48]Not Borderlands.
[120:50.16]No way.
[120:51.44]I've played The Sims for longer than that.
[120:53.50]But The Sims 4 is not even the best one.
[120:55.38]It's like The Sims 2 or The Sims 3.
[120:57.96]I should play The Sims 1.
[120:58.74]Alright.
[121:00.57]Mark this on your calendar.
[121:01.35]I'm going to play The Sims 1.
[121:06.33]Like soon.
[121:07.39]In the next week or two.
[121:08.73]Like two or three weeks from now or something.
[121:11.72]It's alright.
[121:13.03]Okay.
[121:14.29]So.
[121:15.75]Definitely not.
[121:17.25]Probably not.
[121:18.73]Probably not.
[121:20.43]Probably not.
[121:22.59]I put all these games I put in like the same category.
[121:24.80]Like I just I'm only playing for like a few hours and I don't like.
[121:29.68]All the four hour games have to be in the same place except for Mario Galaxy.
[121:32.38]Done.
[121:33.66]Horrible.
[121:34.93]Horrible.
[121:39.24]Uh, Avengers is probably the worst game ever, right?
[121:41.46]Like, it has to be.
[121:42.64]Mario Kart, I don't like the Mario Kart.
[121:44.22]It's not overcooked.
[121:45.38]It just doesn't belong here.
[121:46.34]Four hour, Andy.
[121:48.36]I only played it for like three hours on stream with the catalogs.
[121:50.88]Alright, that's perfect.
[121:55.86]That's more accurate.
[121:59.81]For me.
[122:01.64]Alright.
[122:02.20]Until Dawn, I just don't think they're bad games.
[122:05.00]I just don't think they belong, like, really on the list of best games ever.
[122:08.30]But we'll just keep it here.
[122:16.38]Okay.
[122:17.34]Is Modern Warfare 3 better than Warframe?
[122:21.84]No.
[122:23.66]Is Far Cry 3 better than Modern Warfare 3?
[122:25.62]Yeah.
[122:26.93]Yeah.
[122:30.22]Is Until Dawn better than Modern Warfare?
[122:31.66]Yes.
[122:33.30]Yes.
[122:34.30]No.
[122:43.73]No.
[122:44.05]Okay, that's fine.
[122:45.93]Alright, now this is really important.
[122:46.95]Is Warframe better than Far Cry 3?
[122:48.81]Yes.
[122:50.15]Is DuckTales Remastered better than Warframe?
[122:53.43]No.
[122:55.41]Warframe moves up.
[122:59.93]Is Mordhau better than Hearthstone?
[123:02.93]Hearthstone is better than Firewatch.
[123:04.13]I mean, what?
[123:23.48]Firewatch was cool, but... I liked the experience, but it was just...
[123:32.58]Alright, let me just tell you.
[123:33.42]I was one of those.
[123:34.14]I was one of those.
[123:35.76]Look, the game's been on for like fucking seven years.
[123:39.01]I was one of those people.
[123:40.27]I didn't like the ending.
[123:43.85]I didn't like the end of the movie.
[123:49.50]Is it?
[123:55.04]And I felt like the entire thing was building up to the end of the movie.
[123:59.56]And I wasn't a big, I didn't really like the end of the movie.
[124:02.60]I liked the movie.
[124:03.92]I liked the experience.
[124:06.08]I did.
[124:06.34]It was a good, it was fun.
[124:07.02]It was, it was decent.
[124:07.94]It was good.
[124:09.76]But I felt like the whole thing was leading up to the end.
[124:12.92]And I was like, well, I didn't really like the end.
[124:14.50]If the whole thing was leading up to the end for me, then I wasn't a big fan.
[124:17.68]The photos were, yeah, it was alright.
[124:20.70]It was fun.
[124:23.95]For those of you that don't know, the photos I'm in is my favorite video that I ever made on the channel.
[124:30.90]That's my favorite video.
[124:34.28]I get asked that all the time, and it's hard for me to pick, but that's my favorite video I ever made.
[124:42.58]Jerma Rumble Live was awesome, but I don't know.
[124:48.27]I still think that that's my favorite video I ever made.
[124:54.98]That's the video I show people when I introduce them to you.
[124:57.12]Well, that's a weird one to pick.
[125:00.00]Anyways.
[125:04.04]Portal is better than Counter-Strike.
[125:07.19]Counter-Strike is better than Dying Light.
[125:09.11]Dead Rising is better than Dying Light.
[125:10.49]It's just a better version of the same kind of game for me.
[125:14.05]No More Heroes is better than Dying Light.
[125:15.51]All these are better than Dying Light.
[125:16.63]All of them.
[125:19.51]Smite is definitely... No, it belongs here.
[125:24.28]Dying Light just really kind of belongs all the way down here.
[125:29.63]Yeah, it was alright.
[125:31.05]It was good.
[125:31.63]Yeah, it was good, but... Alright.
[125:35.35]Name me one character's name from Dying Light.
[125:40.21]Any character in the whole game.
[125:41.11]Name me a character's name.
[125:42.02]You understand?
[125:54.09]Kyle Crane.
[125:56.81]If you just, you can't just go to Google and type in dying light characters and just pick one out.
[126:01.51]You know what I mean.
[126:02.15]I can't, I can't name you one.
[126:07.56]They're all just a, just blank face.
[126:10.90]I can't name you anything.
[126:13.50]All I remember is me and Ster chasing this weird zombie around and he ran into a fence and killed himself.
[126:24.10]That's the only thing I remember.
[126:24.94]That's the only thing I pulled from that game.
[126:28.09]It's on Ster's video.
[126:34.09]It's really funny.
[126:36.81]And I remember Ster throwing an axe into somebody's head.
[126:42.81]Somebody was like standing there like we were looting somebody and like an axe just hits him in the skull.
[126:48.66]Oh my god, what's with my eyes?
[126:53.08]Oh, that's where the meme is from!
[126:54.64]That's where Coffees, Cheetos, that's where that's from.
[126:57.43]But that was a secret video.
[126:58.59]That was not in the main video.
[127:01.19]That's a secret video.
[127:02.25]That's not the main one.
[127:05.83]Alright, let's continue.
[127:07.73]I think I like where this is all standing right now.
[127:10.35]Whose is better than... Metal Gear Rising.
[127:14.59]Is it... Limbo's... Okay, Star Wars has Star Wars in it.
[127:20.64]It's better than Overwatch.
[127:22.34]Alright, now it's gonna get tricky.
[127:23.94]This is where it becomes hard.
[127:28.25]I really did like Shadow of War.
[127:29.63]I thought it was fantastic.
[127:31.67]This goes down.
[127:33.91]This goes down.
[127:35.13]This goes down.
[127:36.03]This goes down.
[127:36.77]This comes up.
[127:37.95]This goes down.
[127:39.48]This goes up.
[127:41.04]This goes down.
[127:42.66]This goes down.
[127:43.76]This goes down.
[127:46.12]This one goes down.
[127:48.78]This goes down.
[127:50.54]This goes up, actually.
[127:53.22]This one goes way up.
[127:54.74]Way, way, way, way up.
[128:00.29]This goes up.
[128:01.61]That goes down.
[128:04.95]That goes, this goes up.
[128:06.43]This goes up.
[128:08.35]That goes down.
[128:10.41]That goes down.
[128:13.29]So does this.
[128:14.87]This one does too.
[128:16.09]To here.
[128:17.91]This one goes down too.
[128:20.21]That one goes down as well.
[128:21.45]This one goes up.
[128:23.50]We got it?
[128:33.18]Yep.
[128:34.42]Yep.
[128:35.28]This goes down.
[128:41.79]Prairie was, like, more fun than Metal Gear.
[128:43.73]No, it wasn't.
[128:44.61]It was close.
[128:55.61]Level up for Shadow of War.
[128:56.75]Shadow of War is better than Planes vs. Zombies.
[129:01.61]God, yell at me.
[129:04.57]Is Shadow of War better than Metro 2033?
[129:06.53]That's very close.
[129:23.52]Say 2033 33 times.
[129:26.54]2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033, 2033.
[129:27.90]Got it.
[130:02.15]And doing that made me realize it's better than Shadow of War.
[130:06.62]Thank you.
[130:09.18]Ugh.
[130:11.84]You know, you guys ever look in the mirror and you get terrified?
[130:13.96]Not of losing this.
[130:16.02]Not of having, like, get crow's feet here.
[130:19.13]No, no, no, no.
[130:20.49]How many of you guys are fucking horrified at the notion of eventually having this?
[130:24.59]Like, I don't want that.
[130:32.75]Like, I don't, I don't want that.
[130:35.43]And it's gonna happen to everybody.
[130:42.15]Just that, like, sagging, weird, fat pocket that's under the chin.
[130:46.25]I, I, get, make me bald?
[130:49.31]Have me have crow's feet, wrinkles everywhere.
[130:51.17]Do not give me the turkey neck.
[130:52.91]I don't want it.
[130:53.66]It's, I, it's one thing I really don't want.
[130:56.54]And it's already kind of happening.
[130:59.36]I gotta do, like, exercises.
[131:05.68]You, like, go put your chin up, right?
[131:07.36]You have to do exercises.
[131:11.83]Uh... Plants vs. Zombies is going down.
[131:16.87]And Hotline Miami is going up.
[131:20.43]Understand?
[131:20.93]So is Celeste.
[131:29.33]Spider-Man was better than... Oh, that's tough.
[131:32.92]Sekiro was not better than Cuphead.
[131:34.46]Sekiro was... This isn't hard.
[131:41.04]Now it's really hard.
[131:51.03]Sekiro was good, but... Dark Souls is leveling up.
[131:57.33]And so is Dark Souls 3.
[132:00.47]Left 4 Dead 2 was very good, but it's going down.
[132:07.23]Red Dead's leveling up to great.
[132:10.67]Fallout was... Yep.
[132:13.97]This is leveling up as well.
[132:18.75]Losing viewers.
[132:21.03]Well, it's because every time I move a game that's your favorite game up a slot or down a slot that you didn't agree with, you leave.
[132:28.72]So when I just went from Left 4 Dead 2, from great to very good, this is somebody here's favorite video game.
[132:36.78]And they went... And they fucking clicked the X. And it happens for every single one of these, because statistically speaking, if there's 14,000 people here, somebody in here has a favorite game on this list.
[132:49.91]It's every single one of you.
[132:50.95]Like, this is somebody's.
[132:52.17]This is somebody's.
[132:52.87]This is somebody's.
[132:53.80]All of this is somebody's favorite game.
[132:57.38]So when I take Cuphead and I go like this... Two, three, four hundred people just collect X. That's how it works.
[133:06.18]Alright.
[133:07.10]Let's go.
[133:09.36]Is Mario 2 better than Left 4 Dead 2?
[133:10.91]They both have 2 in it.
[133:34.09]Level up.
[133:35.42]Level up.
[133:36.96]Level up.
[133:39.78]D level.
[133:41.70]No, no way.
[133:48.35]You know what?
[133:49.67]D level.
[133:49.83]D level.
[134:11.26]Resident Evil 2 was more fun for me than Dark Souls 3.
[134:17.79]Is Minecraft better than Dark Souls 3?
[134:28.38]Yeah.
[134:29.56]Probably.
[134:35.36]Half-Life 2 is... The Half-Life games are better than Dawn of War.
[134:40.36]And Hades.
[134:41.48]And Cuphead.
[134:42.56]Yeah, they are.
[134:43.58]They are.
[134:43.88]BioShock is definitely... Oh, this is gonna make people so angry.
[134:55.08]Me even remotely considering scrolling my mouse this way.
[135:00.91]Put this in front of this.
[135:03.25]It's not good for a lot of you.
[135:07.47]I'm considering it.
[135:13.50]It's close.
[135:24.54]I played way more... It has to go down there.
[135:34.26]That's fair.
[135:35.36]That's accurate.
[135:36.02]Like, it has to be down in four hour ante.
[135:37.90]Because I only played it for, like, fucking five hours.
[135:49.89]None of these other games did I play for four hours, right?
[135:55.19]No, I've played a shitload of all of these up here.
[136:00.60]Yeah, alright, this is good.
[136:07.56]I'm happy with this.
[136:08.38]Minecraft is better than Resident Evil.
[136:09.82]Minecraft is better.
[136:11.40]Minecraft is better than Hitman.
[136:13.90]Hitman is... Resident Evil... Yeah, Hitman got de-leveled.
[136:17.32]Sorry, you got de-ranked.
[136:21.19]Oh.
[136:22.27]Oh, how far is Hitman going to fall here, though?
[136:24.91]Is Cuphead better than Hitman?
[136:26.09]Yeah.
[136:26.65]Hades better than Hitman.
[136:27.58]Close.
[136:27.96]Yeah.
[136:29.12]Isaac, yeah.
[136:30.64]Here we go.
[136:33.04]This is where it gets much harder.
[136:36.11]I think that's where it stops.
[136:42.36]Look, if Pac-Man gets to be up here and Doom Classic gets to be over here, Minecraft is one of those games that's going to be the Pac-Man when you and I are 50.
[137:07.50]Okay, I'm done.
[137:11.48]Wait, Half-Life 2 better than Dark Souls 3?
[137:14.28]Yes.
[137:17.19]All of these are better than Dark Souls 3.
[137:20.79]Alright.
[137:22.59]Half-Life 2 better than Resident Evil 2.
[137:30.11]No.
[137:34.87]No, it's not.
[137:36.82]Not for me.
[137:40.07]I loved Resident Evil 2.
[137:41.75]I loved it.
[137:42.19]It was like my favorite game of the year.
[137:45.27]I thought it was fantastic.
[137:46.61]I loved it.
[137:51.95]Like, when I finished Half-Life 2, I was like, wow, that was fucking awesome.
[137:55.35]That was unbelievable.
[137:56.95]When I finished Resident Evil 2, I said, that's one of the best games ever.
[138:03.75]I said that kind of... Maybe I should just level it up
[138:11.70]Yeah, it's leveled up.
[138:14.45]And by the way, Fallout New Vegas just got leveled up too.
[138:18.13]And guess what?
[138:18.69]Doom is going down here.
[138:20.61]I don't care.
[138:21.69]A game came out in the fucking 60s or whatever.
[138:23.81]I don't care.
[138:25.33]It's classic, sure, but what's it doing up here?
[138:34.13]These two have to be next to each other because they're about to fight each other.
[138:36.31]Mirror.
[138:39.56]Mirror.
[138:41.63]That's fair.
[138:42.29]Pac-Man does not go down too.
[138:45.50]I love Pac-Man.
[138:47.64]It goes down here.
[138:56.48]Because that means Half-Life 2 is like the best in its category for like a great game.
[139:05.02]But I... The other games up here on this list...
[139:09.69]I need to just triple check and make sure I had more fun in them than I did Half-Life 2.
[139:13.32]Because this is now the barometer for like a great, very, very just great experience.
[139:22.92]Let's find out.
[139:25.80]Pac-Man.

[142:11.91]I think I actually broke a controller with Shadow of the Colossus.
[142:16.65]I think the grip was fine.
[142:18.45]I couldn't grip.
[142:19.25]I hated the control scheme.
[142:21.45]And I think I literally broke a controller in half.
[142:24.73]Like 15, 20 years ago.

[145:24.73]Is Half-Life Alyx better than World of Warcraft?
[145:30.50]Think.
[145:31.00]Think really hard on this.
[145:32.42]No, it's not.
[145:34.08]It's not.
[145:34.54]I had so many wonderful memories in World of Warcraft back in like 2005.
[145:39.96]This is... Nothing will be able to cross this.
[145:42.96]This is not going up here, but nothing will cross that.
[145:49.32]Portal 2 better than Resident Evil 4?
[145:53.90]No.
[145:56.16]Is Resident Evil 4 better than GTA 5?
[146:02.23]Yes.
[146:09.97]I think so.
[146:11.51]It's so close.
[146:12.30]It's by like 0.01%.
[146:23.14]Alright.
[146:25.70]Team Fortress 2 or Diablo II or Bloodborne.
[146:28.56]Let's see.
[146:29.14]I think I'm done with this.
[146:30.23]Wait, is Undertale better than Warcraft 3?
[146:32.79]Is Mario Galaxy better than Metal Gear Solid?
[146:35.99]Is Zelda better than Dark Souls?
[146:38.74]Let's find out in this video.
[146:40.86]I feel like I'm making a fucking top 10 list.
[146:51.24]Oh, I hate to do that.
[146:53.56]But I'm gonna.
[147:07.69]I'm done.
[147:11.53]This is it.
[147:12.27]I really believe.
[147:18.92]that Team Fortress 2 is the best video game ever made.
[147:25.36]It's the best game ever made.
[147:28.10]It just is.
[147:30.06]Now, it might not be that supported right now, but holy shit, back in like 2010, 2011, 2012, this is the best game ever made.
[147:37.67]Ever.
[147:51.11]Hmm.
[147:56.08]Is Bloodborne better than D2, though?
[147:57.84]Hmm, yeah.
[148:00.10]Is D2 better than GTA 4?
[148:01.92]Yeah.
[148:03.02]Is Chrono Trigger better than Bloodborne?
[148:04.56]No.
[148:05.58]I think this is accurate.
[148:06.30]2013 was peak TF2.
[148:13.29]Nothing can come close.
[148:15.65]I have never cared about a video game more than I did TF2.
[148:21.27]2010 2011 to like 2015 oh god nothing will ever come close if if this is a barometer for where a video game has to cross to be better like a best game ever made oh you've it's you've got a long way to go so here's look at see these two I find Bloodborne to be one of the best games ever made I do this is not even close
[148:47.50]If we're talking about a scale of, okay, this is like the best game ever made for me.
[148:51.73]And this is like a second best game ever made.
[148:55.57]You're talking about like, like 50 points to go to cross from here to here.
[149:02.27]If TF2 is like a 100, Bloodborne's like a 60.
[149:05.99]And like everything else is underneath it.
[149:09.46]It's so impossible to cross that threshold.
[149:11.48]Somebody has to do something insane.
[149:13.06]TF2 is on its own tier.
[149:16.21]Yeah.
[149:16.81]No, that's accurate.
[149:17.99]That's true.
[149:23.09]It belongs up there.
[149:23.77]It does.
[149:29.07]And literally everything else will never come close.
[149:30.91]Like, maybe one day somebody will make something that is.
[149:33.29]Where's Stardew Valley?
[149:34.14]Because that's, like, that actually, like, belongs up here somewhere.
[149:39.20]Okay, so Stardew Valley's not on this list.
[149:43.44]But
[149:46.13]heyday of Facebook gamers that's weird okay can I pretend this is Stardew Valley because like heyday like farming or something alright this is this is Stardew Valley
[150:13.66]Stardew Valley better than Resident Evil 4.
[150:15.32]I think so.
[150:19.84]Heyday.
[150:22.14]I got 5,000 hours on Heyday, man.
[150:24.94]I'm number one in my Facebook group.
[150:32.64]Now it's perfect.
[150:33.16]Alright.
[150:33.68]There it is.
[150:34.26]There's your video game.
[150:35.34]Tetris sucks.
[150:36.22]I hate that game.
[150:38.92]And that's it.
[150:40.54]That's going to be the stream.
[150:42.86]Um, so I've got to figure out... I've got to figure out what this is.
[150:47.14]I've got to figure out what this means.
[150:53.80]I wonder what he wants me to find, Grandpa.
[151:01.79]I will see you guys on Saturday.
[151:06.27]What are you going to do, a Tetris stream?
[151:09.80]What about Slime Rancher?
[151:11.49]Uh, Slime Rancher is like up here somewhere.
[151:15.53]No, it's not.
[151:15.89]It's like here.
[151:20.39]Where the fuck is Dark Souls 2?
[151:22.01]Do you really think Dark Souls 2 should be on this list?
[151:26.39]I mean, it could be.
[151:27.77]It may be, but it would be down here.
[151:29.01]Oh, we'll do the same as one after the stream on Saturday at some point.
[151:40.23]At some point.
[151:41.61]We'll see.
[151:43.16]I will see you guys on Saturday.

[151:48.22]Pacific, I might think about figuring out what this is.
[151:51.78]I'm going to go explore.
[151:52.42]In fact, I'm just going to go explore now and just see if I can find anything.
[152:01.09]I'm not even being the same damn close.
[152:06.11]Yeah, we'll see you on Saturday.
[152:08.63]Uh, that's been the stream.
[152:09.99]Just wanted to hang out for a few hours and just say what's up.

[152:43.28]Oh my god.
[152:44.08]But all in all, I hope that Saturday's fun.

[155:50.98]Why is it going so fast?
[155:52.82]Oh, I thought it was about to count.
[155:54.02]I thought it was counting down.
[155:55.08]Did you see that?
[155:59.33]That was like a five second timer.
[156:01.73]That was weird.
[156:08.23]Maybe you guys didn't see it on your end.
