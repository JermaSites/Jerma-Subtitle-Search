[01:20.37]Hey, there you all are.
[01:28.60]Good evening.
[01:30.94]Good evening.
[01:35.34]So GTA is a game I haven't played in a long time.
[01:39.53]They added what seemed interesting enough to me to want to play it again.
[01:45.03]It's like crazy stunt Mario Kart levels.
[01:48.43]So we're going to try them.
[01:51.76]It's been a long time since I've been in this game.
[01:56.98]What are we going to play?
[02:01.48]Is the game audio here?
[02:02.86]There we go.
[02:06.44]Let me remember how to play.
[02:07.37]I still got the wine guy.
[02:08.63]Let's have some wine before we start this.
[02:14.35]I don't even know the last thing I did.
[02:15.39]I'm going to put different clothes on.
[02:20.19]While people trickle in here.
[02:23.71]What do I have, like, for saved outfits, anything?
[02:29.08]He should have, like, a gray suit on.
[02:30.70]Okay, there's the gray jacket.
[02:37.95]What about, like, his pants?
[02:41.45]I need, like, fucking good suit pants.
[02:45.16]We'll do that instead.
[02:58.24]This is Vineyard 2, confirmed.
[03:01.64]What's with his shoes?
[03:03.28]He's got sneakers on.
[03:04.32]I'm gonna give him some smart shoes.
[03:11.03]Oh, he's just fucking bare feet.
[03:12.51]Who cares?
[03:12.91]Does he get gloves on?
[03:19.98]If I remember correctly, the last thing I did in this game was I did the heists.
[03:25.49]Which allowed me to be able to get in the game.
[03:28.17]And, like, get in to, like, an apartment that's nice and wonderful looking, apparently.
[03:32.64]Let's just get on the streets and just stop fucking punching people.
[03:34.80]This is GTA, right?
[03:39.50]Ah, hold on a second.
[03:40.32]This is important.
[03:43.88]Get over there and drink that wine before we start.
[03:52.07]Wearing gloves, but not shoes.
[03:55.43]That's the way we do it.
[03:59.84]Let's get out there.
[04:03.30]Hey, rock'em, sock'em.
[04:05.40]Thank you for five months.
[04:06.44]They say, pretty good.
[04:08.52]Pretty good.
[04:09.85]Oh, shit.
[04:10.33]Fuck off, Lamar.
[04:10.91]I don't want to talk.
[04:14.23]Let's go into the wild world.
[04:17.91]The extreme world of GTA Online.
[04:23.28]Stunt series now available across the map.
[04:24.58]Enter that to play a range of new and exciting stunt races.
[04:27.26]They're everywhere, it seems.
[04:29.92]Where's my car?
[04:31.24]Do I have a car?
[04:34.24]I don't think I have a car.
[04:35.26]Where's my money?
[04:35.84]Do I have any money?
[04:38.76]Where's my fucking money?
[04:40.34]Oh yeah, now I remember why GTA is the best fucking game ever.
[04:46.32]Fuck your car!
[04:50.19]Alright, let's try one of these.
[04:56.36]Stunt rally.
[04:58.36]I hear people screaming.
[05:01.57]This is the lady you're running from.
[05:07.40]Somebody's in a helicopter just raining hell.
[05:10.72]Oh, well.
[05:11.16]Okay.
[05:13.44]Uh, somebody just subscribed.
[05:14.88]Let me look at it again.
[05:17.40]This always happens.
[05:18.96]My, uh, my, like, recent activity always goes away for some stupid reason.
[05:23.08]It's like, stay up here, man, so I can see.
[05:25.08]So I can see who subscribed.
[05:27.78]There we go.
[05:29.22]So that was Benji Menji for four months and Rock'em Sock'em for five months.
[05:34.31]Uh, I don't even have a radio on.
[05:39.18]I believe... Okay, find my name here, guys.
[05:42.78]Can you find my GTA 5 name?
[05:53.05]Which one am I?
[05:53.73]How do I... Let's do this.
[06:07.11]Here we go.
[06:08.61]Yeah, that's me.
[06:09.11]That's me.
[06:09.77]Booger Burps is me.
[06:13.37]You found me.
[06:17.41]Seriously, Booger Burps.
[06:18.39]What is this outfit?
[06:22.50]What do I have access to?
[06:23.42]Alright, we're going to go with this one.
[06:26.52]I don't want it to be... No.
[06:29.22]No, we are going to go with this one.
[06:35.48]I'm going to use Evil Knievel's suit.
[06:39.30]And I'm going to give the fucking nose pick for my win.
[06:50.19]So I have no idea what the hell this is going to be.
[06:54.01]All I know is it's stunt GTA races or something.
[06:57.63]What do I do?
[06:58.45]Yeah, I'm ready.
[06:59.17]Let's go.
[07:06.33]Okay, here we go.
[07:07.05]First stunt race.
[07:11.65]Oh, dear.
[07:14.16]Who is it?
[07:16.56]Get out of the way.
[07:18.68]Let's do it.
[07:21.06]Holy shit.
[07:21.94]Stuff's on fire.
[07:29.67]Why would you fuck that up in the very beginning, you idiots?
[07:34.42]Just go.
[07:35.00]Somebody exploded.
[07:38.24]Somebody blew up already.
[07:39.50]Okay.
[07:39.88]Get out of the way.
[07:43.20]I'm winning this.
[07:48.79]Okay, this is pretty cool.
[07:50.43]This seriously is just Mario Kart.
[07:52.91]Oh, there's a big turn.
[07:54.35]There's a big turn.
[07:58.38]Now we're going off-road?
[07:59.32]Are you shitting me?
[08:01.04]I can't do this.
[08:01.54]I can't do this.
[08:06.33]No, hold on, hold on a second.
[08:07.75]Hold on, I can fix it.
[08:09.05]I can fix it.
[08:09.63]I can fix it.
[08:10.59]I can fix it.
[08:11.29]I can't fix it.
[08:12.35]I can't fix this.
[08:13.63]I can't do it.
[08:16.31]How do I get back up there?
[08:19.57]Are you shitting me?
[08:20.51]I'm gonna have to explode.
[08:23.15]What do I do?
[08:24.79]Okay, go back.
[08:25.25]Spawn, spawn, spawn, spawn.
[08:26.09]Spawn.
[08:28.99]Go.
[08:30.31]I'm only in ninth place.
[08:31.45]It's okay.
[08:36.06]See, they weren't kidding.
[08:37.00]This is just seriously fucking carnage.
[08:40.34]Don't worry.
[08:40.70]Some idiot.
[08:42.40]Some idiot will do what I did.
[08:46.12]Where the fuck are we going?
[08:48.74]Where's the next checkpoint?
[08:51.14]Oh, it's down there.
[08:51.85]Okay.
[08:57.50]I've lost this by far.
[08:59.10]Look at that up there.
[09:01.48]What?
[09:04.51]Alright, I'm picking up some speed.
[09:06.01]I can see them in front of me now.
[09:09.85]Jerma, you are the idiot.
[09:10.97]I know.
[09:11.67]But there's plenty of Jermas in the world.
[09:16.43]Wow.
[09:21.33]Yeah, I'm catching up.
[09:22.97]It's only a little bit longer.
[09:25.67]Okay, we're gonna go through the freaking giant saw blade.
[09:30.05]Here's the one sorry bastard that like got hit by a truck or something.
[09:33.17]He's right here.
[09:35.79]Fucking god damn it.
[09:40.89]Hey, give me a little bit of slack.
[09:42.19]This is my first time playing GTA in like a year.
[09:46.64]Holy fuck.
[09:49.50]What?
[09:53.88]At least I got past that guy.
[09:55.32]Only in seventh place, don't worry.
[09:59.44]Why does it keep saying that guy committed suicide?
[10:04.48]Alright, this is fucking awesome.
[10:11.76]I'm so glad they added this.
[10:13.94]Okay, seventh place.
[10:15.09]I'm okay with that.
[10:20.31]Oh, fuck.
[10:21.09]No.
[10:21.78]No, it's okay.
[10:23.96]Shortcut.
[10:25.78]What are you doing?
[10:26.26]That guy was, like, waiting for me.
[10:30.76]Thank you, Custy15.
[10:32.00]Welcome back.
[10:33.21]For three months.
[10:38.25]Much appreciated.
[10:39.23]I somehow got to sixth place.
[10:44.26]What is that noise?
[10:52.58]This is so fun.
[10:54.28]I'm so glad I decided to play this.
[10:57.16]Are you shitting me?
[10:59.62]No, no, I can't let fucking like David do this.
[11:03.44]Good thing, good thing me and David are both idiots.
[11:05.16]Or whatever that guy's name is.
[11:06.04]Gutsy Grinder.
[11:13.21]Oh god, this is...
[11:20.87]Stop turning.
[11:24.15]These races are long as shit.
[11:30.26]Pokey Pokey.
[11:31.18]Oh, Pocky Pokey.
[11:32.06]Thank you.
[11:32.42]Welcome back.
[11:33.60]Oh, no, no.
[11:33.98]Welcome back.
[11:34.48]Welcome for the first time.
[11:35.74]Welcome for the first time ever.
[11:40.57]And then McNub for two months.
[11:42.65]Welcome to both of you.
[11:47.85]I need an off-road car or something.
[11:54.17]I'm gonna get, like, a monster truck in here.
[11:56.01]Alright, well, the finish- the people are finishing.
[12:04.66]This is so- this is so difficult.
[12:14.15]One more.
[12:15.77]This track seems... It's not the same track.
[12:18.47]Is it?
[12:18.73]Yeah.
[12:20.19]Nice try, dickhead.
[12:21.79]Oh, no.
[12:24.35]Good try.
[12:25.63]You almost got me.
[12:27.41]But I finished sixth.
[12:31.21]Thank you, Mr. Squishy.
[12:32.03]Welcome back for five months and a new show.
[12:35.17]That was fucking fun.
[12:43.00]We got Flutters as a new sub.
[12:44.38]Welcome, Flutters.
[12:46.42]And then Mr. Squishy for five months.
[12:47.70]McNub for two months.
[12:48.48]And then Pokey Pokey.
[12:49.76]Pokey Pokey.
[12:50.40]Just subscribed.
[12:51.44]Custy15.
[12:52.38]And then Benji Menji.
[12:53.56]I think I missed you, Benji.
[12:54.98]I don't know why I just said everybody's name again.
[13:00.09]But I did.
[13:00.67]This is fucking fun.
[13:03.25]The last update they did to this game I thought was pretty lame.
[13:06.49]They did like a huge update on... It was like Chase the Monster or something.
[13:13.22]Remember that?
[13:13.56]Remember, like, Chase, the bad guy?
[13:15.04]That's the werewolf person?
[13:17.33]They did, like, random events.
[13:18.55]They weren't really that fun.
[13:20.89]This seems pretty fun.
[13:23.63]I'm gonna like that one.
[13:28.49]Can you guys, like, hear me slamming my iced tea, by the way?
[13:30.71]I'm sorry if you can hear that.
[13:33.23]Every once in a while, you're gonna hear, like...
[13:37.75]Okay, what is the bowling one?
[13:39.97]Uh, excuse me.
[13:41.21]No, excuse me.
[13:42.47]Do the bowling one.
[13:43.55]Are you kidding me?
[13:47.82]We don't do the bowling one.
[13:48.64]This is just a lost cause.
[13:51.24]I'm your dad!
[13:53.66]Destroy him!
[13:57.10]Whoa!
[13:58.86]Neon is a lost art.
[14:01.42]Welcome, dude.
[14:01.94]Thank you.
[14:05.27]Much appreciated.
[14:09.18]Yeah, I can't believe I was the only person that voted for bowling.
[14:14.31]We're not even doing bowling.
[14:16.11]What a joke.
[14:19.93]I don't know what this is.
[14:22.27]It's like a straight line in a hallway.
[14:29.42]Why is everybody saying whoa?
[14:31.94]That's Jerry the King Lawler saying whoa.
[14:35.39]Wait, you're from Boston?
[14:36.09]Thought you guys didn't have iced tea?
[14:37.45]Oh, we had iced tea, man.
[14:39.19]Iced tea, iced coffee, whatever you're drinking, we got it.
[14:47.26]Standard two-laps motorcycles.
[14:49.04]This is going to be a complete nightmare.
[14:50.94]Listen to me, son.
[14:53.43]I'm your dad.
[14:55.85]Destroy him!
[14:59.29]Whoa!
[14:59.75]Whoa.
[15:01.53]Everybody welcome not Shiggy.
[15:03.75]This is not Shiggy.
[15:05.13]This is somebody else.
[15:09.88]Oh, color.
[15:10.54]We're obviously doing mustard yellow.
[15:14.54]Do I have a mustard yellow suit to go with it?
[15:19.10]I could put on my cool gray suit.
[15:21.36]Do I have my white gray suit?
[15:24.00]No, we're going to stay mustard.
[15:27.16]No helmet.
[15:29.16]Not doing a helmet.
[15:31.63]We'll just stay with the Akuma.
[15:36.79]German's new project is him starting a new company.
[15:38.95]That's not true.
[15:39.61]Let's find out what happens.
[15:45.63]My bet?
[15:47.19]A thousand bucks.
[15:51.02]What?
[15:51.18]I don't have... Do I not have a thousand dollars?
[15:55.66]How much money do I have?
[15:56.76]Can I not bet any money?
[15:58.50]Okay.
[15:58.64]Okay.
[16:03.03]So what is this one?
[16:12.39]Thank you Riley2000.
[16:14.21]Welcome to the channel.
[16:15.47]Welcome to the family.
[16:18.06]Someone's gonna fall immediately.
[16:19.28]That always happens.
[16:20.26]Like for instance this guy right here.
[16:21.76]Right in front of me.
[16:25.00]Oh dear.
[16:28.58]God.
[16:31.19]Alright, this time, no messing around.
[16:32.69]I gotta stay with the group.
[16:35.23]You know what I mean?
[16:36.63]The tortoise and the hare.
[16:39.05]Somebody's gonna make a mistake and I'm gonna win.
[16:46.97]I said that and immediately tried to run that guy off the road.
[16:55.01]Come on, get me up there.
[16:57.88]Listen to me, son!
[17:00.34]I'm your dad!
[17:00.94]Look at this jump!
[17:01.70]Destroy him!
[17:06.60]Whoa!
[17:06.88]Slimer Joel, that was a crazy jump, wasn't it, Slimer?
[17:10.46]Thanks for subscribing, though.
[17:11.36]Welcome, man.
[17:14.07]This is pretty straightforward, actually.
[17:16.73]So, on August 2nd, I believe, they're introducing you making your own tracks.
[17:21.59]Which, I can't wait for that.
[17:24.29]Seeing all these pieces, you could make something outrageous.
[17:29.29]There's one guy in fir- What?
[17:31.57]What?
[17:32.42]Where is it?
[17:33.26]Where do I go?
[17:35.32]Okay, this way.
[17:38.64]I guess you could jump the other way and do like a skip?
[17:41.64]I'm gonna try it.
[17:44.45]Nope.
[17:45.09]Wasn't on that one.
[17:54.30]How do you correctly spell whoa?
[17:55.78]I don't know.
[17:56.86]I believe it's W-O-A-H.
[17:58.92]Like, whoa.
[18:01.26]W-H-O-A would be like whoa, wouldn't it?
[18:05.02]I'm not sure I'm gonna catch this guy.
[18:08.20]Where's my nitro boost?
[18:13.89]This is easy straight away.
[18:16.17]This guy has to make a mistake.
[18:17.11]No, I gotta catch that lip.
[18:19.13]On that big... Don't fuck this up.
[18:22.51]Oh my god, I'm freaking out.
[18:25.02]It's not this one, the one after this.
[18:26.64]I'm going to try to land on the right.
[18:28.38]On top.
[18:33.22]See, to me, that means... Yeah, right here.
[18:34.66]Here we go.
[18:34.94]I'm going to see if I can make it happen.
[18:37.20]He fucked it up.
[18:40.14]It wasn't that one!
[18:43.83]No!
[18:45.07]I thought it was that one.
[18:47.03]Ah, shit.
[18:47.73]That sucks.
[18:49.59]Fuck.
[18:50.77]It's not that one.
[18:52.03]It's the next one.
[18:53.27]God damn it.
[18:55.59]Okay, well that was the one that fell off.
[18:58.01]That's fine.
[19:00.93]I'll get it right here.
[19:02.28]I have to get this.
[19:05.02]It's this one.
[19:06.36]Here we go.
[19:06.76]I overshot it!
[19:16.27]Fuck!
[19:19.55]No!
[19:21.34]Oh, I thought it was way further.
[19:22.58]Ah, fuck me.
[19:25.38]Seriously.
[19:25.91]I way overshot that.
[19:28.55]It's like right here.
[19:29.49]I didn't even need to go that far.
[19:32.83]And I think I still missed it.
[19:35.37]I still fucking missed it.
[19:38.77]Hey, faded apple.
[19:40.57]Oh, fappled apple.
[19:41.69]Yeah!
[19:58.35]I thought I could just... Hey, 1,400 bucks.
[20:26.20]But thank you Fappled for your five months.
[20:31.20]Appreciate it, dude.
[20:33.20]Actually, no, that was all right.
[20:36.48]I'm sorry.
[20:39.90]Just the way that I broke my neck.
[20:44.12]It should have given me the victory.
[20:45.42]I should have been able to cross with my body.
[20:47.12]That's bullshit.
[20:53.39]666, the number of the beast.
[20:56.17]I miss this game so much.
[20:58.07]I'm so glad I'm playing it again.
[20:59.69]Can we please play the bowling alley?
[21:06.01]I hope we're going to the bowling alley.
[21:07.19]By the way, is the game audio too low?
[21:09.18]Or can you guys hear it?
[21:11.02]I didn't really play around with that before streaming.
[21:14.22]This is on PC.
[21:16.12]I'm using an Xbox One controller, though.
[21:17.74]Because I don't like driving on keyboard.
[21:21.00]It feels awkward to me.
[21:26.76]Please be bowling.
[21:29.18]The audio's fine?
[21:29.80]Okay, good.
[21:31.92]This is not bowling.
[21:34.54]I wanted bowling, but I didn't get it.
[21:36.46]It's another bike race, though.
[21:48.96]Did me and Stir have a fight?
[21:50.30]No.
[21:53.50]Not at all.
[21:55.38]He's killing it right now in Overwatch.
[21:58.20]So, he's doing his thing, I'm doing my thing.
[22:00.74]We're still friends.
[22:09.97]There's a lot of races, too.
[22:13.47]It's not like, oh, there's like four.
[22:15.21]I think there's like 20.
[22:15.90]There's like 15 or something.
[22:20.68]Just watched the Paul Bearer video, gotta say I was not disappointed.
[22:25.95]I mean, Paul Bearer is one of the greatest characters of all time.
[22:30.36]One of the greatest comedic actors ever.
[22:34.26]Good old Percy Pringle.
[22:45.77]Let's go.
[22:47.13]Come on.
[22:47.49]I don't want to wait all day.
[22:50.64]I'm going to do a different bike.
[22:56.13]Hmm.
[22:59.87]Go with the batty 801.
[23:01.19]I think he did the group.
[23:05.18]Let's go green.
[23:07.40]I'm your dad.
[23:09.80]Destroy him.
[23:13.24]Whoa.
[23:13.44]All right, this dude's name is what's going in the toilet.
[23:18.85]What's going in the toilet?
[23:23.75]You can see the track.
[23:25.45]Well, thank you, toilet.
[23:26.67]What's going on in the toilet?
[23:27.51]Appreciate it.
[23:29.41]Welcome to the club of... Welcome to the club of unreasonable gentlemen and ladies.
[23:38.66]Why can I not bet money?
[23:41.70]Bet 500 bucks.
[23:56.18]Let's do it.
[23:57.42]This one seems... jagged.
[24:04.60]Ah, I was trying to get somebody to hit me.
[24:06.26]Immediately.
[24:09.44]Such a tiny little spot for all the bikes to have to go on.
[24:14.84]Oh.
[24:16.82]Is my guy, like, fat?
[24:17.72]Is that why I'm not good enough?
[24:20.04]Oh, there you go.
[24:20.46]You gotta cut.
[24:20.96]You gotta drift.
[24:23.73]Thanks for the boost, buddy.
[24:24.47]You just bumped me.
[24:31.53]Look at this whole track.
[24:32.39]This is insane.
[24:33.17]That guy just bumped me and he's fucked himself.
[24:40.06]Oh!
[24:41.48]See ya!
[24:44.96]That guy just got launched.
[24:47.92]Why'd he do that?
[24:49.84]Why'd he go under?
[24:50.42]Ooh, I see.
[24:53.34]That's cool.
[24:53.82]I feel like I'm gonna hit my head on this thing.
[25:05.66]It's opening and closing?
[25:09.68]Thank you, Diggy Dump.
[25:10.98]I'm gonna go under this time.
[25:15.36]Welcome, Diggy Dump.
[25:19.48]Okay, how did that fuck hit me up, but not him?
[25:25.69]Don't ask me how.
[25:26.73]Don't ask me how.
[25:28.68]Come on, pick up the fucking pace.
[25:29.90]I'm not finishing last again.
[25:33.98]I'm not gonna make that.
[25:36.75]Holy shit, I just barely made that.
[25:38.41]That was so lucky.
[25:39.39]I wasn't going fast enough.
[25:43.19]Whoa.
[25:47.40]Gotta like stay on the inside to pass this guy.
[25:58.52]Super jump.
[26:01.34]Super jump.
[26:04.22]This guy's doing everything perfectly.
[26:08.66]You missed a secret.
[26:09.70]Yeah, I'm sure I missed a bunch of secrets.
[26:15.69]I'll be alright just staying in 4th.
[26:26.87]This one's like a... eh, out of ten I think There's not enough going on, it's just too boring I almost just fucked that whole thing up There's no real opportunities for me to pass anybody because it's very straightforward Still cool though Just lean Don't lean that far!
[26:55.67]Holy shit, he blew it!
[26:58.21]How did he just blow it?
[26:59.05]He just blew it so bad!
[27:00.00]I'm in third place, guys.
[27:04.80]I don't even know what the hell that guy did to blow it that bad.
[27:12.34]I'm saying I'm making fun of that guy now.
[27:13.58]It's gonna happen to me.
[27:14.14]I'm gonna do the same damn thing.
[27:18.09]I'm so scared to go under.
[27:20.78]Do a flip?
[27:21.58]You wanna do a flip?
[27:22.84]Alright, fine.
[27:24.20]Next big jump, I'm gonna do a double flip.
[27:27.92]No, I'm not.
[27:28.72]One flip.
[27:29.30]Only one.
[27:29.96]Don't get too overzealous with the flips here.
[27:35.53]Thank you, Strider.
[27:40.71]Welcome, Strider.
[27:42.05]Strider Zee.
[27:50.66]I actually did it.
[27:52.46]What the fuck are you doing?
[27:54.74]Get out of here, you little ant.
[28:01.71]Stop it!
[28:05.05]How did he still pass me?
[28:07.13]What the fuck?
[28:08.87]That's so not fair.
[28:09.93]Alright, we're going double front flip.
[28:12.83]Double front flip.
[28:16.58]What?
[28:16.74]What?
[28:24.78]I'm in sixth!
[28:26.32]I'm in sixth!
[28:27.24]I didn't want to be in sixth place again.
[28:29.96]Go for a backflip!
[28:34.22]Why are the backflips so easy?
[28:36.55]Do you guys see how shitty that was and how easy that was?
[28:40.91]Why are the backflips so much easier than a frontflip?
[28:43.81]You'd think the frontflip would be ten times easier and I fucking am in sixth place.
[28:47.97]Un-fucking-believable.
[28:54.80]Tall Lucario, thank you for four months.
[28:57.40]I didn't come in last.
[29:02.44]Dude, those backflips, I, like, float in air.
[29:04.22]When I do frontflips, you could just, like, spin going forward.
[29:09.52]Sorry, we got sixth place.
[29:13.28]Waffle of Wonder and Tall Lucario, thank you both.
[29:16.30]Both of you guys for four months, respectively.
[29:23.89]I'm giving that one a dislike.
[29:26.23]I didn't like that one.
[29:33.32]Do you remember the fast boy?
[29:36.30]If you can't handle me at my worst, obey your thirst.
[29:42.00]Okay, please do bowling.
[29:47.28]How do you not immediately pick this?
[29:51.32]No, I wanted you to when we... Wait a minute, that one looks kind of crazy too.
[29:58.22]Plummet?
[30:02.57]Ow!
[30:02.73]Ow!
[30:03.99]What?
[30:05.79]What's that?
[30:08.63]I just turned my stream on like 20 minutes ago.
[30:10.77]What are you doing?
[30:11.45]Hello?
[30:11.77]Hello?
[30:17.28]Oh, I have a quick question for you.
[30:19.69]I'm streaming right now.
[30:20.85]Really?
[30:21.17]I know you're streaming.
[30:22.03]What?
[30:22.37]Really?
[30:23.41]What?
[30:23.77]I'm not allowed to interrupt you?
[30:25.09]You just said Kevin was screaming at me.
[30:27.15]What's going on?
[30:27.85]What?
[30:29.01]I just have a question.
[30:30.64]Okay.
[30:31.14]Oh, my God, dude.
[30:32.26]How much space do we have on our Dropbox?
[30:35.78]We have...
[30:43.65]Why is this so funny?
[30:44.59]I don't understand this joke.
[30:46.11]She's laughing because I'm interrupting you for this.
[30:51.17]I bought Dropbox Pro.
[30:53.19]Yeah, I know.
[30:54.67]But I don't think it works.
[30:57.86]Why doesn't it work?
[30:58.92]I think I have to upgrade it to a business account.
[31:02.27]this should be using it no like we have to make like I bought pro but pro doesn't mean that like everybody connected to one folder can use that like amount like the hey chat help us out on this how if somebody has dropbox pro they can like put stuff in their folders you have to have like dropbox pro 2. pro 2. you have to have you know you also have to have dropbox pro what if you if I upgrade to business then I can add like team members
[31:33.11]Look, I'm trying to play GTA.
[31:35.33]What's the matter?
[31:36.19]What do you need?
[31:37.99]Edit this into the video.
[31:42.35]Did you see what they added in GTA, by the way?
[31:45.42]It's Mario Kart.
[31:46.88]They added insane Mario Kart levels.
[31:49.42]I'm watching you now.
[31:51.28]I'd recommend people watch your stream.
[31:53.58]You have a good stream.
[31:54.54]Oh, thank you.
[31:56.02]I just was talking about how well you're doing.
[31:58.64]God damn it.
[32:01.06]Holy shit, look at that.
[32:01.76]Could you please not swear?
[32:03.02]That's one thing that actually brings your viewers back.
[32:05.36]Oh my god, look at this loop-de-loop.
[32:09.14]What the fuck?
[32:10.74]Come on, bullshit.
[32:12.90]Alright, so, how you doing?
[32:16.20]Hi, is there a problem around here?
[32:18.26]Am I bugging you?
[32:19.34]No.
[32:20.30]Do you want to play?
[32:21.90]Where the fuck am I even going right now?
[32:26.40]Oh my god, I'm gonna explode.
[32:29.72]You know, I was gonna buy Track Mania, the new one, but this looks like you're playing it already.
[32:33.61]Wait a minute.
[32:34.79]Wait a minute.
[32:36.17]Hold on.
[32:36.49]Wait a minute.
[32:36.89]I can, like, cut everybody off.
[32:39.45]No, wait.
[32:39.75]That's not gonna work.
[32:41.93]Hold on.
[32:42.31]I'll get back to normal.
[32:43.93]I brought my laugh track with me.
[32:45.97]Sorry.
[32:46.49]I can't turn it off.
[32:47.71]Stupid.
[32:51.83]Dude, this is so crazy.
[32:54.07]I can't even, like, tell what direction I'm going.
[32:57.37]Like, I'm backwards right now.
[33:02.81]I fixed it, I fixed it, we're good.
[33:06.11]Fine.
[33:07.45]This one is way more ridiculous.
[33:12.39]Jesus.
[33:15.85]Wait, are you still here?
[33:16.55]Hello?
[33:17.31]Yeah.
[33:18.05]Yeah, I'm trying not to interrupt.
[33:19.47]I'm trying to talk to my friend, but he's like, we're both gamers.
[33:24.09]Yeah, so how... God damn it.
[33:29.56]This is not going to work out that well.
[33:36.67]Going to first person, that might actually help.
[33:39.25]Oh yeah, this works.
[33:40.49]I can't wait to go up on the loop-de-loop.
[33:56.05]This is way harder.
[33:57.81]This is like 10 times harder.
[33:59.53]This is so much harder in first person.
[34:08.41]It's not possible in first person.
[34:10.41]Now I'm just on the regular road.
[34:11.91]Might as well just go play regular GTA.
[34:15.49]Okay, let's go pick up fucking Cousin Steven, whatever his name was.
[34:23.52]This one is so good.
[34:26.86]People must be... People must be spectating me.
[34:32.50]I can't do it.
[34:33.48]I can't fucking do it.
[34:35.12]I can't do it.
[34:36.94]I can't do it.
[34:39.08]I'm not doing anything wrong.
[34:40.46]I'm doing it the way you should do it.
[34:41.86]Just like Tony Hawk taught me.
[34:43.76]See?
[34:45.60]Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
[34:50.46]How do I, how do I, like, give up?
[34:54.70]Oh, there's a guy, there's a guy's car.
[34:57.12]I saw just fly off.
[34:58.80]It's not just me.
[35:03.29]What?
[35:03.55]Wait, what?
[35:05.35]What?
[35:11.44]This is too much.
[35:13.06]I can't take it anymore.
[35:15.11]I can't do it.
[35:15.91]This one is too clown cartoon video.
[35:21.63]Wow.
[35:23.59]Oh, God!
[35:26.17]That was insane.
[35:27.37]Okay, what is it?
[35:30.66]Somebody has the cops on them.
[35:35.52]I hear machine guns.
[35:38.14]Who is shooting a machine gun?
[35:46.43]I'm sorry, Star.
[35:48.23]Really wacky shit's going on.
[35:50.03]Yeah, that's why I don't want to interrupt.
[35:52.49]You're having a fun time.
[35:54.15]Once I'm done with this race, then we can have a little talky talk.
[35:57.42]Okay.
[35:58.22]Have fun.
[35:58.94]That's going to be over in like two seconds.
[36:03.21]I got lapped.
[36:05.27]The cool part about this, though, is I guess in, like, in August, August 2nd, I think, you can make your own tracks.
[36:15.28]So... Yeah, I was going to say, wasn't this... There was always, like, custom modes and custom maps that you could make in GTA, and a lot of people did races.
[36:25.63]Yeah, but all these parts, like, all these, like, loop-de-loop... Motherfucking goddammit.
[36:31.31]Ugh.
[36:33.99]Where's my I concede button?
[36:35.85]Where is it?
[36:36.77]I concede.
[36:38.21]How do I concede?
[36:39.16]Wait, no, no, no, hold on.
[36:39.80]I'm not the only one.
[36:40.32]I'm not the only one.
[36:43.34]I'm gonna just start texting.
[36:46.41]Oh my fucking god, I can't do it.
[36:56.18]Okay, I lose.
[36:59.40]I got disqualified.
[37:00.40]Good.
[37:01.32]You're having a bad day.
[37:03.00]Oh my god.
[37:05.02]How do I say LOL?
[37:06.52]I'm gonna say LOL to this guy.
[37:07.82]I wanna say LOL.
[37:09.70]LOL.
[37:13.95]Oh.
[37:15.27]God, that was fun.
[37:17.31]That was terrible.
[37:18.01]It was awful, but man, that was fun.
[37:20.95]I gotta give that one a... No, I didn't want a thumbs up.
[37:23.01]I gave it a thumbs down.
[37:25.88]Everybody in this lobby's gonna be like, yeah, this fucking idiot thumbs it down.
[37:30.66]He, like, sucks at it.
[37:31.93]Yeah, he thought, like, this was gonna be, like, a normal race.
[37:35.79]I laugh when you guys fail at the loops, those straight down falls.
[37:40.17]Alright, how are you?
[37:42.71]I'm great how are you I'm good so to answer your dropbox question uh I'm going to upgrade to like a dropbox business account and then anybody that's like part of like the oh like the dropbox business account it's like it's like a terabyte or something it might even be infinite
[38:03.65]But you have to have the business account?
[38:06.37]Yeah, I bought Dropbox Pro thinking that I could just... Oh, now I can share a Dropbox Pro folder with anybody, but no.
[38:15.31]I can put whatever I want in my Dropbox, but it won't sync with you if you don't have that much space.
[38:21.41]Really?
[38:22.31]Yes, that's how I understand it.
[38:24.14]How much do the free ones have in space?
[38:26.54]Two gigs, I believe.
[38:28.66]Or like three gigs.
[38:31.00]But hold on, I gotta mention a couple people, because during that nonsense.
[38:35.39]Let's get some names in here.
[38:36.51]Mick Bearson, subscribed for three months during that.
[38:38.53]Thank you, Mick Bearson.
[38:39.17]Welcome back.
[38:40.03]And DragonBreath75 for five months.
[38:42.45]Thank you, fucking DragonBreath.
[38:44.17]You're back.
[38:46.23]Thanks to both of you guys.
[38:47.87]And Star... We got a new sub!
[38:49.93]We've got a new subscriber!
[38:55.75]And Star Wyvern, thank you.
[38:57.33]Welcome.
[38:58.54]Appreciate it, Star Wyvern.
[38:59.68]Welcome to the fucking crew!
[39:01.06]Yeah, welcome to the crew.
[39:02.16]This one is called Plummet, so... Google Drive is 15 gigs.
[39:09.09]Yeah, why do you ask?
[39:11.75]I can, like, put stuff in Dropbox and have a public link.
[39:17.30]I gotta get the stream that I just did to Kiki.
[39:20.66]Like, 4 gigabytes.
[39:22.86]Wait, what?! !
[39:26.62]I mean, I can host it for you if you want in the meantime.
[39:29.78]I send it to you, then you upload it.
[39:32.72]Yeah, you send it to me.
[39:34.56]I'll make it a public Dropbox link for her to download.
[39:38.34]I think you can use Google Drive, though.
[39:40.14]Or Google Drive.
[39:41.66]Ronnie says Google Drive is so annoying to use.
[39:44.46]Dropbox is way easier.
[39:45.46]I hate Google Drive, but...
[39:48.90]Let's get Cohen on the Robs.
[39:52.60]Let's get Cohen on the Robs' opinion on this whole thing.
[39:56.36]Because he's subscribed for five months.
[39:59.28]Wow, but what about Mercy?
[40:01.26]Mercy.
[40:02.78]Yeah, she's so thirsty.
[40:05.88]What are you doing?
[40:09.78]I'm trying to stay hip.
[40:10.83]I'm trying to stay popular with the kids.
[40:12.15]That is pretty hip.
[40:12.83]You're right.
[40:15.62]Okay, bright green, no.
[40:17.52]Actually, give me the fast card.
[40:18.82]Give me the proto.
[40:20.50]And I want it to be light blue.
[40:24.63]Thank you, Mercy.
[40:25.15]You're welcome.
[40:27.61]You can put files from a shared folder in your personal folder as soon as you get it.
[40:31.01]Yeah, I wish they just made it much easier than that.
[40:32.39]Because, like, people buy Dropbox Pro like me.
[40:35.21]They spend a hundred bucks.
[40:37.04]Wait, you're having, like, an intelligent conversation in your chat.
[40:43.38]What?
[40:44.72]Sorry, I don't even know how I can explain how this is this funny to me.
[40:48.34]Well, it's about to get funnier.
[40:49.18]You're streaming GTA, having like a fun time.
[40:52.04]Your chat is mostly Jerema Suns.
[40:55.23]German sons, yeah.
[40:56.05]And then every once in a while, like, you get some very important information about Dropbox things.
[41:00.61]Yeah, dude, this is the way it is.
[41:02.36]Are you ready for this?
[41:03.22]Look at this one.
[41:03.92]Look at the Superman ride of steel at Six Flags.
[41:06.84]Oh my goodness.
[41:07.68]You've got the Superman car.
[41:09.08]Yeah, I have the Superman car and I'm going on the tracks at Six Flags New England.
[41:12.64]Superman doesn't drive a car.
[41:13.82]I'm in first place.
[41:14.60]Fuck you!
[41:16.06]Fucker!
[41:16.72]Hold on.
[41:17.03]I'll get back to first.
[41:18.77]What?
[41:20.01]Oh, just you wait.
[41:21.51]Now it's all sons.
[41:23.33]Ha ha ha.
[41:26.54]Oh, yeah.
[41:27.91]This is gonna be so fun.
[41:31.09]Right now, we're getting ready to go.
[41:32.81]We're going up the chain.
[41:35.25]Okay, slow down, slow down.
[41:37.25]Slow down, because here comes a big drop.
[41:40.79]So many people are gonna... Oh, God.
[41:42.85]We're definitely breaking the sound barrier right now.
[41:49.02]Stop losing control!
[41:50.42]Wait, what?
[41:52.26]What the...
[41:56.36]This guy's still going.
[41:58.38]This guy's still going.
[42:00.52]Get out of the fucking way.
[42:08.91]Get out of the way.
[42:10.17]Oh, that was insane.
[42:18.21]That was the most intense thing I've ever experienced in GTA.
[42:20.79]It was too much, too much intensity.
[42:28.25]It's like that one scene in Spy Kids 3.
[42:30.17]I've never seen Spy Kids.
[42:33.63]What?
[42:34.71]That's what somebody just said.
[42:37.01]Oh, this is fucking incredible.
[42:38.19]Oh, I thought you were making that reference.
[42:40.18]I was about to question how you knew.
[42:42.06]No, no.
[42:44.04]Look at what's up there.
[42:45.26]Look at that mess.
[42:49.28]Don't go off the edge, please.
[42:51.34]I'm not going to be in sixth place again.
[42:54.43]It's like living islands.
[42:58.69]Come on.
[43:00.15]Somebody's gonna fuck this up.
[43:01.21]You know they are.
[43:03.79]If you just saw the out-of-control nonsense that happened just at that last drop, watch this one.
[43:08.93]This one's like a curlicue french fry from your local Italian deli.
[43:14.74]It's gonna be me that fucks it up.
[43:20.40]Alright.
[43:21.50]Here we go.
[43:24.66]This guy ain't going that fast.
[43:25.76]I can catch him.
[43:32.65]Drift!
[43:32.99]Drift, you fucking idiot!
[43:34.05]Just like that movie!
[43:35.37]Drift!
[43:35.77]Just like the fucking movie!
[43:37.90]What?!
[43:42.10]Holy shit.
[43:43.82]That guy was in first place.
[43:59.87]Sorry dude.
[44:00.93]I'm sorry about that one.
[44:02.69]I didn't mean to.
[44:08.02]I feel like you can cut those off.
[44:09.40]You see the openings in the median?
[44:12.66]I can definitely go through one of those, but I'm not gonna do it because it'll be in sixth place.
[44:17.72]Way...
[44:21.13]Alright, now it's turning into a fucking fork.
[44:23.37]Oh boy.
[44:24.07]Oh boy, it's my chance.
[44:25.01]Everybody just fell off.
[44:26.31]Watch this one.
[44:26.83]Look at that, third place.
[44:28.55]And these guys are going real slow.
[44:30.27]Oh boy.
[44:30.83]Oh boy.
[44:32.91]See ya.
[44:33.81]Wouldn't wanna fucking be ya.
[44:35.83]Cause now I'm in first place, boys.
[44:39.36]First place.
[44:40.42]I just gotta hit the target.
[44:43.34]Is that what I have to do?
[44:45.02]What do I have to do?
[44:46.86]I think I have to hit the target.
[44:48.50]I just won.
[44:50.12]I did it.
[44:50.94]First place.
[44:52.44]I fucking did it.
[44:58.61]First place, boys and girls.
[45:00.68]It's just that easy.
[45:01.58]Just wait till people fall off.
[45:10.23]This is really fun.
[45:12.61]This guy's just going straight... What the fuck is he doing?
[45:22.85]Oh, boy.

[45:55.56]Thank you, all of you guys.
[46:00.00]And we still have yet to do bowling.
[46:04.68]No, I don't want to do that one.
[46:07.54]This is the one that I couldn't do.
[46:12.38]From dead last to first.
[46:13.61]Yeah, that's right.
[46:17.05]You've got to play the game.
[46:20.47]He's not just good.
[46:21.65]He's the best.
[46:25.93]So Star, there's a bowling in this one.
[46:28.05]I want to do it.
[46:29.51]I'm not sure if he's here.
[46:30.23]Is he here?
[46:30.51]I don't think he's here.
[46:33.41]Star, are you here?
[46:35.41]Yeah, I'm doing a lot of things.
[46:36.93]Oh, okay.
[46:41.32]No!
[46:41.92]Isn't this the one that I can't do?
[46:43.77]I think this is the one that I fly off the map on.
[46:46.65]We're not going to fuck this up.
[46:59.66]Thank you, Lala Chan.
[47:01.30]Lala Chan won.
[47:03.28]The first.
[47:04.72]First of his name.
[47:05.84]First of her name.
[47:06.58]Whoever you are.
[47:08.38]And then we got Shrivel with the four months.
[47:09.82]Hey, Shrivel.
[47:11.48]Shrivel is a guy that's in this channel a lot.
[47:13.94]I'm sure you know him by now.
[47:19.37]Oh, God, not this map again.
[47:20.51]I know, seriously.
[47:21.37]I'm going to try everything in my power to not fall off.
[47:26.68]It's going to be hard, but I'm going to try.
[47:28.50]Okay.
[47:35.58]But I think I asked you before, do you want to play it?
[47:37.60]Do you want to do this?
[47:39.96]I'm rendering a thing, and I don't even have it installed.
[47:43.06]Oh.
[47:43.60]Yeah, GTA takes like an hour to install if you don't have it.
[47:46.38]It's like a 70 gig file or something crazy.
[47:48.70]It looks really fun.
[47:50.22]It is.
[47:51.14]I wish I could.
[47:52.32]I'm not sure how much there is to it.
[47:57.12]It seems like there's at least like 15 or so, 20.
[47:59.38]It's definitely fun for the time being, that's for sure.
[48:04.04]Like, like maps you mean?
[48:05.56]Pre-made ones?
[48:06.30]Yeah, like ones that they made.
[48:08.10]You can't make maps, I don't think, yet.
[48:09.40]Not for like another few weeks.
[48:11.39]Why?
[48:12.47]I don't think so.
[48:16.21]Oh, this is like my car, isn't it?
[48:17.63]Yeah, I'm gonna use my car.
[48:19.96]Yeah, that's the, that's why I won that last race.
[48:22.34]Use my car.
[48:25.00]I'm betting a fucking thousand dollars.
[48:32.49]What's my internet speed?
[48:33.23]100 down, 10 up.
[48:38.18]Change your piece of shit, Honda.
[48:42.66]What's with this music?
[48:45.94]Is that somebody's horn?
[48:50.63]This thing kind of handles like shit, though.
[48:59.60]Skippy squeeze isn't Skippy's hold on a little bit of nonsense Welcome Skippy squeeze.
[49:06.03]Thank you for your subscription You've been around for a long time, but this is your first subscription, or what is it not and what you said before?
[49:14.79]God damn it I Thought I fucking had that oh God damn it.
[49:23.24]Why did I bet $1,000 on this oh?
[49:26.64]I knew I couldn't do it.
[49:28.70]Oh, God!
[49:29.36]Oh, no.
[49:34.10]Oh, fucking my God.
[49:35.95]This is a catastrophe.
[49:38.53]This is a total catastrophe.
[49:40.63]I can't do it.
[49:41.65]I can't.
[49:43.21]I can't.
[49:43.97]I can't do it.
[49:47.27]You know sometimes you admit your mistakes and you admit the things you can't do in the you know Give me the strength to accept the things I cannot change Courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.
[49:57.16]I know the difference.
[49:57.78]I can't do it You know what I mean sometimes you just know when you can't do something Berman you can do this.
[50:07.30]I did it, but it took me like six times You've already done it.
[50:11.58]Yeah, I've done it.
[50:12.08]Okay What was I thinking?
[50:14.90]What was I thinking there?
[50:16.95]What was I thinking?
[50:17.93]I was going to try to jump onto their track?
[50:20.15]What was I thinking?
[50:23.23]Am I some kind of dummy?
[50:24.27]Yeah.
[50:25.05]Okay, okay.
[50:26.05]Stop.
[50:26.39]Don't turn.
[50:27.23]Don't turn the car.
[50:29.09]I have to.
[50:29.57]I had to.
[50:36.92]I had to.
[50:37.80]You all know I had to.
[50:38.78]God damn it.
[50:49.04]Damn it.
[50:50.40]This is not fucking funny.
[50:52.73]This just sucks.
[50:57.69]I had to do that.
[50:59.29]I'm not in the last place.
[51:01.73]Somebody is doing worse than me.
[51:04.18]Remember that.
[51:05.66]There's at least four people or so that are doing worse than me.
[51:12.76]This whole thing reminds me of Superman for some reason.
[51:16.73]Game sucks.
[51:19.14]Here we go again.
[51:19.62]Just don't touch anything.
[51:22.21]Every time I touch something, I get in trouble.
[51:25.03]Jesus.
[51:28.43]Okay.
[51:30.81]Oh, I did this fine last time.
[51:35.15]Alrighty.
[51:36.08]So far, so good.
[51:39.30]I might actually pass somebody.
[51:41.32]It's possible.
[51:43.81]There's only nine people in the lobby.
[51:45.26]Oh, yo, go drat.
[51:47.48]You're right, bro.
[51:49.30]You're right.
[51:51.06]I got a new personal best.
[51:53.18]Meanwhile, I'm struggling to put my fucking pants on.
[52:02.40]I'm doing okay now.
[52:03.66]You know, I shook the cobwebs out.
[52:05.42]Maybe I'll get a new personal best.
[52:09.55]Yeah, look at that.
[52:10.11]Personal best.
[52:13.15]I did it.
[52:15.76]Lap two of two.
[52:16.78]My god.
[52:18.85]I have to hope somebody severely fucks up and that I don't fuck up at all.
[52:23.23]But you know that right here it's gonna happen.
[52:25.45]I'm not gonna touch anything.
[52:28.01]Don't touch anything.
[52:33.22]Got it.
[52:34.18]Didn't touch anything.
[52:37.22]First try.
[52:37.86]You guys see that?
[52:40.94]First fucking try.
[52:44.21]I'm actually gaining on somebody.
[52:46.92]There's a guy just up the corner here.
[52:53.33]He just went through the loop.
[52:55.71]He's gonna drive off the cliff.
[52:57.29]Guaranteed.
[52:59.49]See, not me.
[53:00.23]I figured out the strategy.
[53:01.71]I know how to do it now.
[53:03.35]Don't touch a thing.
[53:04.35]Just let it work.
[53:05.21]Let it ride.
[53:09.36]Smooth as butter.
[53:14.50]Yeah.
[53:15.34]Smooth as butter.
[53:18.11]Only I did that the first three times.
[53:24.62]Uh, yeah, I'm not gonna... Wait, I am gonna catch that guy.
[53:26.40]That guy exploded.
[53:29.00]Guy in front of me just blew up.
[53:31.08]I'm not gonna be in last place, guys.
[53:34.84]And just like that, I dodge being the worst in the lobby.
[53:51.82]He got behind me.
[53:54.76]What did he do?
[53:56.48]What did he do?
[54:02.49]That guy went through like a fucking wormhole.
[54:17.02]How did you fuck that?
[54:20.39]No, dislike this one.
[54:21.89]I fucking hate this one.
[54:24.03]This one's not good.
[54:24.91]I just keep thinking that guy's mindset.
[54:35.54]It's just panicking.
[54:39.76]I gotta get in front of this guy.
[54:42.84]Alright, what about this one?
[54:44.44]Turbine.
[54:45.26]This one looks pretty fun.
[54:52.28]Quit taking your crappy electric car?
[54:55.86]My car, I have you know.
[54:57.77]I did all the heists.
[55:00.55]And I made like a million dollars in that car.
[55:03.21]That's like a million dollar car.
[55:04.53]So, excuse me.
[55:06.05]That's the car that I'm proud of driving.
[55:07.77]Okay?
[55:08.41]Excuse me.
[55:13.70]Yes, it is about 1040 right now.
[55:15.38]Eastern.
[55:16.56]Eastern.
[55:22.49]Yeah, I can't even go onto turbine.
[55:24.95]Nope.
[55:25.33]Everyone wants to do the one where you fall straight down again.
[55:28.65]I wish you could do this on bikes.
[55:33.46]This on motorcycles would be one of the funniest damn things ever.
[55:38.42]Please make custom vehicles on... I'm going to do it.
[55:40.96]I'm going to make a custom lobby for this and it's going to be motorcycles.
[55:44.13]Eventually here once I play all the maps once or twice.
[55:57.26]Bet another 1k.
[56:01.39]I could.
[56:03.97]Let more people join.
[56:04.75]Actually, that's a good idea.
[56:05.75]Fill this lobby up.
[56:06.53]It's going to be total chaos.
[56:16.07]Bicycle your way.
[56:17.49]Custom bicycles.
[56:18.41]Just like tricycles.
[56:20.13]Tractors.
[56:20.91]Trucks.
[56:21.25]That would be so funny.
[56:28.88]Write that down.
[56:29.48]It'll be on the test.
[56:34.93]Snowku.
[56:36.19]Thank you, Snowku.
[56:36.89]Welcome.
[56:38.19]Hope you're enjoying the stream.
[56:39.83]Hope you're enjoying these.
[56:41.51]The best GTA online update since heists.
[56:47.29]It's actually one of the only ones.
[56:49.44]Like I said, the update they did before this, it was pretty lame.
[56:53.06]But this, this is good.
[56:55.90]This is great.
[56:57.32]I'm heavily enjoying this.
[57:01.70]No, we're gonna do... Wait, what else we got?
[57:04.82]T20?
[57:05.84]Tyrus?
[57:07.30]We could do a Proto again.
[57:08.29]Oh, we're gonna do the Tyrus.
[57:10.21]No, we want the fastest fucking car.
[57:12.75]No, this one's good.
[57:13.69]Definitely.
[57:15.01]We're gonna do Sky Blue.
[57:16.67]Sky Blue, Mustard Yellow, and Air Guitar.
[57:19.57]Fuck.
[57:20.23]Uh... Damn it!
[57:24.76]I didn't get it.
[57:27.66]Why was I that angry about that?
[57:29.02]Like, damn it!
[57:29.96]Fuck!
[57:37.25]Listen to all these ice cream trucks.
[57:43.01]Ooh, speed boost!
[57:48.95]Fucking running somebody off the road.
[57:50.14]Well, that guy already screwed up.
[57:57.22]This guy's riding the rail.
[57:58.36]What are you doing?
[58:00.16]You're gonna be in a lot of trouble if somebody bumps you.
[58:04.91]I'm gonna watch all these dummies fly off here in a second.
[58:11.38]I'm doing first person.
[58:14.92]We gotta do this in frame.
[58:15.74]Have to be in this mode, right?
[58:17.84]Going straight down.
[58:22.68]Get out of the way!
[58:23.22]Get out of the way!
[58:24.42]The place is to be!
[58:25.28]I'm only going 180.
[58:34.90]Jesus.
[58:36.74]Nobody screwed it up, I don't think.
[58:37.84]I'm pretty sure everybody did it correctly.
[58:42.60]That's really surprising.
[58:46.92]Wow.
[58:49.66]I'll pull back.
[58:53.54]You know, there was only like 8 people in the... 7 people in this lobby.
[58:57.86]So I can understand that.
[59:00.70]You gotta get like 15 people in this lobby.
[59:05.17]Someone's gonna land on me.
[59:08.23]Wow, that was really close.
[59:09.45]If he had landed right on top of me, that would have been insane.
[59:19.37]That's what I get.
[59:20.43]That's what I get for being a dick.
[59:22.97]That's what I get.
[59:25.83]That's what I deserve.
[59:26.85]God damn it.
[59:35.54]Rick.
[59:36.54]Rick Bilby.
[59:37.46]Thank you, Rick Bilby.
[59:38.24]Welcome.
[59:38.54]Thank you for subscribing.
[59:39.32]Welcome to the channel.
[59:40.46]Welcome to the channel.
[59:41.32]Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.
[59:42.46]Welcome to the channel.
[59:43.24]Welcome to the channel.
[59:45.37]Gemma is stupid.
[59:46.49]No, I was trying to run that guy off the road and then somebody clipped me.
[59:49.41]See, he did it to me.
[59:50.71]He did it to me and it worked.
[59:52.21]And now I am so fucked because I'm going to be rolling backwards because I can't drive up this.
[59:57.67]Oh, dear.
[60:02.35]Come on, yes!
[60:04.99]Yes, it worked!
[60:07.33]My master plan worked.
[60:10.32]I just used that guy as leverage.
[60:15.60]Not so stupid now, am I?
[60:17.18]I gotta be careful, I'm gonna drive right into somebody.
[60:27.27]Okay, that's the point where... No, no!
[60:34.30]No!
[60:35.12]No!
[60:37.03]God dammit, fucking shit.
[60:45.97]Why am I here like this?
[60:55.35]How did I go up the rail?
[61:01.42]Sixth fucking place.
[61:06.10]Sixth place again.
[61:06.98]I'm just going to drive like a grandma now.
[61:13.82]Taking her kids to school.
[61:19.07]You know, now is a good time to try the hypothesis of jumping off and doing the Super Mario 64 slide skip.
[61:25.69]Yep.
[61:26.51]Okay, guys.
[61:26.89]You ready?
[61:28.91]No, now's not a good opportunity to do it.
[61:31.27]There is a Mario 64 penguin slide skip on this level, guaranteed.
[61:35.46]I just don't know where it is.
[61:41.92]Oh, I lose.
[61:47.75]Oh, well.
[61:49.05]It was worth a shot.
[61:52.81]We're just going to glide in.
[61:57.51]Go for the world record.
[62:01.17]Didn't even get a chance.
[62:01.91]Did not finish.
[62:03.83]Did not.
[62:04.47]Yeah, I didn't finish.
[62:05.53]I was just looking at the finish line.
[62:07.87]I still technically finished.
[62:12.31]There's no penguin slide skips, dude.
[62:14.97]Yes, there is.
[62:16.48]You have to hit each checkpoint.
[62:18.88]No, the Mario 64 slide skip.
[62:20.52]What are you talking about?
[62:21.82]I know what you're talking about, Ben.
[62:23.24]I'm saying that in here, you have to hit the checkpoints in order.
[62:26.87]But what if one of those checkpoints is on the bottom and you can Mario slide skip down?
[62:31.76]I mean, that makes it harder, but it's possible.
[62:36.26]I don't think it's... I mean, these are rock star developers.
[62:41.36]I love how there's been no threading the needle.
[62:47.39]This one's going to be nuts.
[62:49.91]There's been no bowling for like the last three lobbies.
[62:53.99]Show us the Simpsons drawing.
[62:55.23]It was in your last video, wasn't it?
[62:57.37]Yeah.
[62:59.07]I got like three tweets after posting that video to show people the picture that I think were only prompted by the fact that I had shown people the picture.
[63:06.75]Well, didn't you like flash it at the very end for like two seconds?
[63:11.71]I don't know.
[63:12.26]Do you think I like know how to make videos?
[63:15.22]I know.
[63:19.62]I'm there with you.
[63:24.98]Okay.
[63:25.62]We need more people.
[63:27.29]I might leave and just join another lobby.
[63:29.49]Just because it's a fresh start, you know?
[63:32.73]Yeah, let's quit.
[63:33.73]Let's get some more people.
[63:34.67]Let's punch a few people in the face and run over some people and then... What's going on?
[63:46.35]What's a video?
[63:50.05]I don't know.
[63:50.51]They're very rare.
[63:54.87]Honestly, I have no idea.
[64:01.17]Make your own with motorcycles.
[64:02.17]That's a good idea.
[64:03.25]I want to do the... Where's the actual bowling place to queue?
[64:09.33]I wonder.
[64:09.69]They're all over the map.
[64:10.73]I have no idea.
[64:16.98]One thing that's still in GTA Online is sitting at a loading screen for two minutes like original Bloodborne.
[64:25.40]There's one.
[64:25.88]Oh, yeah.
[64:26.46]They had very long loading screens.
[64:28.40]Yeah.
[64:33.07]Find the VIP.
[64:34.07]Alright, hold on.
[64:37.45]Let me see.
[64:37.75]What else is on the map here?
[64:40.11]I think there's like two guys guarding.
[64:43.95]That up there.
[64:44.59]Are these guys trying to make people not be able to get inside that marker?
[64:49.87]Why are they so hostile?
[64:53.72]I'm going to have to take them out.
[64:55.94]What do I have for weapons?
[64:59.18]Ah, I got some weapons.
[65:03.07]Don't worry.
[65:08.03]Where are they?
[65:11.55]Oh, where's my sniper rifle?
[65:14.75]Let's take a look.
[65:17.03]Got a couple of guys down that way.
[65:20.95]Oh, look at that.
[65:21.73]Oh, look at you.
[65:24.70]Got him!
[65:30.02]Oh, fuck.
[65:30.92]Oh, fuck.
[65:31.14]He doesn't know where I am, does he?
[65:32.00]Yes, he does.
[65:37.38]That's shit.
[65:40.14]Hold on a second.
[65:40.98]Hold on a second.
[65:41.62]Excuse me.
[65:42.18]Hey, can you find my rocks?
[65:44.30]I've seen people who've lost my rocks down there.
[65:49.54]Alright, let's go with the mission.
[65:59.51]Keep the mission successful.
[66:04.42]I did hit that guy.
[66:05.24]That was a pretty good shot.
[66:06.30]That would be so funny if I hit him in the head.
[66:07.52]Hit him in the chest.
[66:12.16]I'm going to go that way.
[66:14.10]Actually, can I say, I can probably look at the map and see what they are, right?
[66:16.42]Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[66:18.24]Big trouble, big trouble, big trouble, big trouble, big trouble, big trouble.
[66:28.95]There's a guy in front of me.
[66:31.20]It was a guy in front of me.
[66:34.66]I got ice cream coned.
[66:37.36]Give me this bike.
[66:43.59]I wouldn't have gone that far.
[66:46.13]I wouldn't have gone that far.
[66:54.02]That guy was going like 20 miles per hour.
[66:59.47]I'll get these two fucking assholes.
[67:02.37]Get the fuck out of here!
[67:07.23]Give me your bike.
[67:09.07]It's my bike now.
[67:10.43]Wait, what?
[67:11.91]Wait, I can't.
[67:13.41]I forgot.
[67:13.65]It's like a personal vehicle.
[67:14.57]Well, give me your car instead.
[67:19.03]Thank you, female Jesus, for four months.
[67:21.11]Female Jesus!
[67:28.33]I was gonna fucking tackle him.
[67:29.45]Dude, I was gonna just cross-check that guy.
[67:36.77]I'm gonna do it.
[67:43.61]I forgot how funny that was.
[67:45.85]I forgot how good this game was.
[67:48.41]This guy's gonna get fucking tackled.
[67:50.27]I'm gonna spear this guy.
[67:53.80]Oh, what's that?
[67:54.40]You didn't think you were going to get spared, did you?
[68:01.39]That was way too late.
[68:02.59]That wasn't even the right guy.
[68:05.87]That wasn't even the right guy.
[68:06.81]I'm going to get in this car.
[68:09.63]Come on.
[68:10.13]Let's go.
[68:12.05]Let's go for it, buddy.
[68:15.05]What?
[68:16.75]What the fuck is going on?
[68:20.19]What?
[68:20.63]Drop.
[68:23.21]What?
[68:24.63]Wait, did he, like, log off?
[68:27.51]He did, yeah, he logged off.
[68:31.71]There he is.
[68:34.43]God damn it!
[68:36.80]It's 2v1, it's not fair.
[68:38.04]Alright, you know what?
[68:42.36]Fuck this.
[68:43.72]We're taking out the ball bat.
[68:45.04]I'm gonna just fucking smash somebody right in the face.
[68:49.68]He's gonna, like, drive by, and I'm gonna smash him in the fucking head when he drives by.
[68:54.71]See, they're two working together.
[68:55.73]Look at the two blips.
[68:57.13]Yeah.
[68:57.97]Yeah, blip this.
[68:59.47]Hey, blip this, dickhead.
[69:08.82]Fuck it, I got him with the fucking basketball bat.
[69:11.06]Fucking hatchet.
[69:18.46]Come on.
[69:21.91]Where are those?
[69:22.31]There they are.
[69:22.69]Those are the two blips.
[69:26.08]Yeah, blip this shit when he comes back around.
[69:28.51]I'm gonna get this and it's gonna be the most embarrassing thing in this guy's life.
[69:33.73]Oh, whatever.
[69:34.99]He's gone.
[69:37.27]Wait, I'll blip this guy.
[69:41.77]Oh, he's turning around.
[69:43.13]Alright, I'm gonna queue it up.
[69:46.37]Guy just walking around the street with a hatchet.
[69:53.09]This is psycho.
[69:55.93]There's a guy just right here.
[69:56.57]I'm gonna get in this car.
[69:57.78]I'm too distracted right now.
[69:59.10]I like want to do the races, but this guy's paused.
[70:04.34]This guy is like paused in his menu.
[70:05.82]No, don't slide.
[70:06.58]Get on the car.
[70:08.06]Get on the car.
[70:09.58]Get on his car.
[70:15.81]Wait, no.
[70:18.45]What are the explosions?
[70:21.15]Oh my god.
[70:25.97]Where is he?
[70:30.27]Bring out the shotgun.
[70:31.41]No, no, no, no, no.
[70:32.03]I said I was gonna blip this guy, and I'm gonna blip him.
[70:38.82]He doesn't even know where I am.
[70:41.62]He's gonna walk up here.
[70:42.42]He's gonna be like, oh man, where'd he go?
[70:43.54]I can't find him.
[70:44.06]He's gonna get fucking blipped.
[70:48.92]Oh, hey, what's that?
[70:50.66]You looking for somebody?
[70:52.16]Are you looking for somebody?
[70:53.53]Get fucking blipped!
[70:54.73]Whoops, whoops.
[70:56.74]That wasn't him.
[70:57.52]That was the wrong guy.
[71:00.10]Here he comes.
[71:04.81]That wasn't him either.
[71:06.73]That wasn't him either.
[71:10.69]He's waiting for me to pop out.
[71:11.91]Ah!
[71:13.69]Give me the fucking ball bat.
[71:23.38]He can't hit a moving target, can he?
[71:26.82]God damn it.
[71:29.44]This guy's got fucking like a super rifle.
[71:35.95]I'm not going to let this keep happening.
[71:41.99]I'm not going to let it keep happening.
[71:43.13]Now you brought out the big guns, buddy.
[71:46.41]You and your fucking friend.
[71:48.59]Say hello to the devil for me.
[71:52.25]Got him.
[71:55.34]Yeah, and you have a little dog, too.
[71:56.96]Where is he?
[71:59.00]Oh, looks like you're both right there, right behind the fucking big Roman Empire statue.
[72:03.63]Ooh, excuse me!
[72:04.61]Here he comes.
[72:14.19]I gotta get out of here.
[72:15.79]I gotta get out.
[72:16.29]I'm in... I'm in deep shit.
[72:22.60]I'm in a real bad spot here.
[72:24.52]I don't have any backup.
[72:26.62]Where's my backup?
[72:43.07]Did I get him?
[72:43.55]I don't think I got him.
[72:49.12]Helicopter.
[72:50.96]This is my way out.
[72:53.23]This is my actual exit here, guys.
[72:55.49]Helicopter in the fucking river.
[73:03.24]You think they're going to get the river helicopter, aren't they?
[73:07.82]What the fuck are these guys doing?
[73:10.22]Get out of the car.
[73:11.26]Bye.
[73:16.35]Alright, I'm just going to go into the Mario Kart levels.
[73:21.79]I'm not messing around.
[73:22.65]I got two guys shooting at me with sniper rifles.
[73:26.23]It's not good.
[73:27.23]This is the river helicopter.
[73:29.05]No.
[73:29.83]They're waiting for me to get it.
[73:31.00]That's what they're doing.
[73:34.58]They're just waiting for me to get it.
[73:37.80]I'm gone.
[73:39.12]You lost me.
[73:42.16]The longest free fall challenge?
[73:45.10]What the hell is that?
[73:45.66]I actually kind of want to do that.
[73:52.89]Alright, the new Mario Kart stuff can wait.
[73:54.65]I want it, like, free fall.
[73:55.79]What does that even mean?
[73:58.63]Actually, no.
[73:59.15]It's right here.
[73:59.57]I'm gonna get it right now.
[74:04.80]Alright, let's try another one.
[74:06.02]Stunt series!
[74:07.00]Let's go.
[74:07.46]It's fucking hot in here.
[74:15.64]It's fucking a thousand degrees in here.
[74:21.80]Okay, hold on a minute.
[74:24.22]Motorcycles.
[74:25.34]So I'm the host, so I can change the settings, right?
[74:30.20]Time of day, noon's fine.
[74:31.24]Traffic off.
[74:32.04]Modern levels off.
[74:32.82]Custom vehicles.
[74:34.32]That's fine.
[74:34.94]Catch up on.
[74:35.60]Slipstream off.
[74:36.78]Actually, I don't know.
[74:38.30]World record.
[74:42.04]Race type.
[74:43.98]Can I change this or do I have to like... No, whatever.
[74:46.00]I just want to do it.
[74:50.18]Let's get some people in here.
[74:52.95]Let's get some dudes in this lobby.
[74:54.59]What do you say?
[75:04.15]I'm going to wait for like a good full lobby, you know?
[75:08.09]So Star, tell us how your day was.
[75:10.35]Heard you had a pretty big day, huh?
[75:12.08]I don't know if he's even here.
[75:25.93]Pretty big day, huh, Star?
[75:26.89]Mm-hmm.
[75:30.30]Are you talking to me?
[75:31.34]No, I was asking how your day was.
[75:34.48]Um... I watched Marco Polo.
[75:38.12]Mm-hmm.
[75:39.96]That show sucks.
[75:41.56]Some people recommended it.
[75:43.06]Marco Polo?
[75:44.86]That's okay.
[75:46.14]It doesn't suck.
[75:48.18]But, like, 90% of it sucks.
[75:51.79]Right?
[75:51.97]I don't know.
[75:55.11]I've never...
[75:57.47]I don't know what you were talking about.
[75:58.97]Is it like a show?
[75:59.67]It's a show.
[76:00.85]It's a Netflix original.
[76:03.69]Oh.
[76:04.25]Wow.
[76:05.07]It was confusing and I'm too dumb, maybe?
[76:07.97]Or I just didn't care about anybody.
[76:12.53]It was like average.
[76:14.01]Marco's interaction with the con was really cool, but that was it.
[76:19.77]Everyone else, they're having sex, so you know it's an adult show.
[76:24.05]But I'm not an adult.
[76:25.21]Maybe that's why.
[76:26.48]You're an adult.
[76:28.21]You have passed adulthood by now.
[76:32.05]I don't know.
[76:32.47]Alright, we're going with the gargoyle.
[76:36.85]Too bad.
[76:38.15]Yeah, my day was... Bleed purple, Twitch.
[76:39.77]We're doing a Twitch TV bleed purple.
[76:41.57]That's why I don't want to answer your questions, because you ask me questions and you just forget about me.
[76:47.76]Marco Polo, I know, it's a game you play in the pool with your brothers and sisters when you're five years old.
[76:51.92]Isn't it fun?
[76:53.16]Yeah, and they made a whole two-season show about that.
[76:59.82]Exactly.
[77:00.38]So now you get where I'm coming from.
[77:03.72]I had breakfast.
[77:05.06]I had some ham croissants.
[77:08.88]Ham and cheese and bacon.
[77:10.26]They're pretty cool.
[77:11.76]Played a little Overwatch.
[77:12.94]And then I got the greatest honor of my whole day.
[77:16.80]Got to be on Jervis stream.
[77:18.12]Nice.
[77:19.17]How's that like?
[77:19.87]Trying to knock this guy off.
[77:24.89]Difficult.
[77:26.21]These are trying times.
[77:28.29]These are very trying times.
[77:32.71]Don't let this guy get a slipstream on me.
[77:35.41]Just knock him off.
[77:37.43]Just knock this guy off.
[77:38.59]Knock him up.
[77:43.07]Almost did it to me.
[77:47.11]Damn, this looks kind of small.
[77:50.30]Wait a minute.
[77:51.60]Oh yeah, you gotta get the checkpoint.
[77:57.84]Why am I always in last fucking place?
[78:01.55]Is that a sign?
[78:02.99]Is something wrong?
[78:04.93]Am I not very good?
[78:06.31]Is there something wrong, guys?
[78:09.23]I think... Not in the last place.
[78:11.53]Just kidding.
[78:12.13]No one's falling off?
[78:17.20]Oh.
[78:17.32]Yeah, people have fallen off.
[78:21.56]You gotta road rash someone.
[78:22.66]Like, drive up to them and hit them.
[78:24.04]I wish I could.
[78:25.88]Oh, you can.
[78:26.88]No, that's me giving them the finger.
[78:30.66]See you later, that guy's gone.
[78:35.24]Just like that, we're in fourth place.
[78:40.36]Alright, now hold forward and just get fucking speed.

[105:13.38]Um, I don't remember.
[105:16.54]Hannibal?
[105:18.32]Cannibal?
[105:20.56]I think it's Hannibal.
[105:22.53]Look at this one.
[105:23.39]This one is a giant tube.
[105:31.47]What are we talking about?
[105:32.65]I need a good show that's on Netflix to recommend to somebody.
[105:36.32]Oh, Marco Polo.
[105:37.78]Don't say that.
[105:38.28]You said it was bad.
[105:40.70]Didn't you say that that show was not good?
[105:43.02]Yeah.
[106:08.55]Okay, good.
[106:09.15]Good answer.
[106:09.81]Good answer.
[106:10.62]Good answer.
[106:11.50]Let's see on the board.
[106:12.54]Was it on the board?
[106:13.70]Let's see.
[106:14.34]Daredevil.
[106:14.92]What the fuck?
[106:18.22]No.
[106:18.46]Wasn't on the fucking board.
[106:21.20]Oh, wow.
[106:21.86]I thought that was a good answer.
[106:23.95]Man.
[106:24.39]Okay.
[106:25.31]We got two more strikes.
[106:30.79]Oh, somebody subscribed.
[106:31.99]Fox881, thank you for three months.
[106:54.19]We were all, like, going to the beat.
[106:56.72]And then somebody just freaks out.
[106:58.78]Oh, Christ.
[107:06.86]No, I can't be on my back.
[107:11.26]Look at this one.
[107:11.94]This is insane.
[107:12.86]Oh, shit.
[107:14.53]Not one of these.
[107:16.95]Not one of these.
[107:17.63]No!
[107:17.69]Okay.
[107:29.86]I'm glad I'm not the only person that can't fucking do this.
[107:35.09]Oh my fucking god, send me to hell.
[107:38.99]Send me to fucking hell.
[107:50.76]You just driving a straight line?
[107:52.08]I did, twice now.
[107:56.41]Can you just grow up?
[107:57.57]God, I can't.
[107:58.85]I'm never gonna grow up.
[107:59.61]I don't want to be a kid.
[108:00.27]I'm a Toys R Us kid.
[108:04.98]Just put it in first person.
[108:14.00]Hold on a second.
[108:15.58]Just give me a fucking second.
[108:20.67]Why am I going that far?
[108:22.33]God damn it.
[108:23.03]I'm actually upset about this.
[108:26.70]I've got, like, this text and shit.
[108:37.27]I'm just way... I'm just done.
[108:39.69]I want to do the slide skip, but... I heard my phone blow up, like, three times, and... Heaven forbid that somebody, like, wants to make a connection with me, and I'm playing Grand Theft Auto Mario Kart.
[108:51.37]Heaven forbid.
[108:52.77]Heaven forbid that somebody wants to have, like, a connection with me.
[108:56.67]Where's the power-ups?
[108:59.37]They got taken out.
[109:01.85]Too much... Too many people... Okay, shut up.
[109:14.39]Don't play Pokemon Go and drive.
[109:15.87]Are people actually doing that?
[109:23.27]I want a connection with you, Jeremy.
[109:26.67]All of us already have a connection.
[109:28.45]We have that streamer, streamer, gamer, gamer connection.
[109:31.80]You know?
[109:35.30]Like, me and Star have a connection, too.
[109:37.80]But that's more of a love-hate relationship.
[109:41.29]Me and Jerma, everyone asked how we met.
[109:43.49]It's a simple story.
[109:44.63]I was just fucking freaked out right there.
[109:46.21]I'm okay.
[109:46.77]The Chinese finger thing?
[109:48.61]What are they called?
[109:49.33]The finger tracks?
[109:51.31]Yeah, we got our fingers stuck in one.
[109:53.67]We were stuck together for a whole day.
[109:56.23]Oh, yeah.
[109:57.07]Yeah, we had to find... It was a cliche cartoon episode.
[110:00.37]We had to find how to get it off.
[110:02.64]But in the time that it was on us, like, we learned something about each other.
[110:05.52]And then, like, at the end of the episode, we walked our separate ways into, like, sunsets, though.
[110:09.92]But, like, we learned something about each other.
[110:11.78]Yeah.
[110:13.20]I learned that, um... Strangely enough, that you get sexual gratification from having your hand inside of a finger trap, which is really odd.
[110:21.35]Yeah, people saying it's called docking, not... We did that, but that's a different story.
[110:28.98]I'm so far behind.
[110:30.40]I haven't even seen a person in like a full two minutes.
[110:39.04]I so badly want to just bail out of this car This is so barren.
[110:45.61]What a wasteland.
[110:47.79]There's no players anymore.
[110:48.93]I'm so behind.
[110:53.35]What?
[110:55.25]Don't fucking laugh at that.
[110:58.03]You think that's funny?
[110:59.01]I do.
[111:01.19]Oh yeah, well watch this one.
[111:02.73]10 out of 10 first try.
[111:08.01]Thank you for the 10 out of 10.
[111:08.77]Nice job.
[111:11.61]You're learning something about... I'm learning something.
[111:14.45]Something about myself.
[111:16.01]You know, it's almost like I had my finger stuck in a... What is it called again?
[111:22.32]China?
[111:23.24]China.
[111:26.32]I had my finger stuck in China.
[111:28.38]Yeah.
[111:29.48]Okay.
[111:33.20]What the fuck are you talking about?
[111:36.76]You know what?
[111:37.38]Get him the hell out of here.
[111:38.94]Get out of here.
[111:41.46]Me?
[111:41.96]Get out of here.
[111:43.26]No, don't leave.
[111:44.40]Okay, you keep calling me back.
[111:46.26]I need you to tell a story in a few minutes when I finish this abysmal course that I can't do.
[111:54.03]Stunt cam.
[111:57.03]Although, you know, I'm strangely catching up to this one guy.
[111:59.27]It's a very beautiful scenery, though.
[112:11.44]Oh, my.
[112:21.04]Listen to me, son.
[112:23.52]I'm your dad.
[112:25.90]Destroy him!
[112:27.60]How far behind are you?
[112:28.98]I don't even know how I did it.
[112:30.88]I was just so catatonic.
[112:33.24]I sold my head, but not my stereo.
[112:36.24]Just subscribe.
[112:36.78]Thanks a lot, man.
[112:37.30]Welcome.
[112:38.72]Hopefully, you got to keep some money out of that.
[112:43.16]You know what?
[112:43.90]No, because I'm using this shitty fucking car.
[112:45.82]It's this car.
[112:46.58]This car sucks.
[112:47.48]It's my car.
[112:48.50]I'm glad that I didn't install this game and play with you.
[112:51.28]Why?
[112:51.46]Because if I did, I'd be like 30 miles away from you.
[112:56.04]Oh, would you?
[112:56.70]We wouldn't even really be playing together.
[112:58.10]Wow, it's would you.
[112:59.44]So confident in that in your statements now.
[113:01.67]Would you?
[113:02.03]Yeah, so confident.
[113:03.11]Would you be that far ahead?
[113:04.19]Yeah.
[113:05.37]Mm-hmm.
[113:06.09]Wow, isn't that interesting?
[113:09.03]You'd be flying by me.
[113:11.59]Good old Jerma.
[113:12.29]You'd be flying by Jerma.
[113:14.85]You'd be passing him.
[113:15.69]You'd be waving out the window.
[113:17.39]Passed him twice.
[113:23.33]I say put your money where your mouth is.
[113:27.23]And not in a Chinese finger trap.
[113:30.67]I need to get a drink.
[113:35.81]Hold on, I'm going to have to back out.
[113:37.09]Hopefully nobody shoots me while I'm gone.
[113:39.72]Hopefully nobody runs me over in a car in GTA.
[113:43.04]Like, shoots me.
[113:44.42]And goes, I got him!
[113:45.56]Like, T-Bag!
[113:49.08]Uh, DNM.
[113:49.46]Alright, I'm going to back out for a little bit.
[113:54.44]I just want to grab some... It's like, seriously, 95,000 degrees in here.
[113:58.52]Yeah.
[113:59.36]So, I will be back shortly.
[114:01.40]I'm going to put the I'm getting T thing on.
[114:05.75]Hey, look, a guy was grabbing some tea.
[114:08.67]Oh, tea time.
[114:10.40]So, by the way, you're getting deafened.
[114:13.00]I don't want to leave you with this kind of responsibility to talk shit.
[114:16.86]I was going to tell stories.
[114:18.20]Yeah, you were going to talk a bunch of shit.
[114:19.56]You were going to say, like, all kinds of fucked up shit when I was gone, and then, like, I'd come back.
[114:24.27]No, I don't do that.
[114:25.59]Oh, what's that?
[114:26.59]Gone.
[114:27.47]See ya.
[114:28.39]Hold on, let's see.
[114:29.67]Any last words?
[114:32.73]Any last words?
[114:33.87]No, you... Fucking get dunked.
[114:40.56]So here's the thing.
[114:43.28]I'm going to undefin.
[114:44.22]He thinks he... Right now he thinks he's deafened.
[114:48.70]Watch this one.
[114:49.75]I'm going to undefin.
[114:53.91]All right, guys.
[114:54.71]I'm going to get some tea.
[114:55.89]See you in a little bit.
[115:08.21]Maybe we'll get, like, an embarrassing fucking, like, burp or something.
[115:14.37]I'll be right back.
[116:16.03]I wanna be a dinosaur when I grow up.
[116:19.19]I wanna be a pterodactyl.
[116:23.28]I wanna be the best.
[116:29.58]Okay, so, clearly not muted.
[116:34.52]Jerma's bad at driving.
[116:36.78]Jerma's never been good at driving.
[116:39.06]Jerma, every time he's ever come to see me, he's been like two hours late.
[116:46.74]So Jerma in a racing game, you can only imagine he's going to be last place.
[116:52.98]He always makes excuses why he couldn't be there on time, but watching his performance, watching his driving on this stream, I think it's clear to everyone that every time he's driven up into the city, driven up into Boston...
[117:05.25]He's just flipped his car off of a cliff.
[117:07.96]And he's trying to hide it from me.
[117:17.84]I'm not talking shit about- No, I'm not talking shit about Jerma while he's gone.
[117:21.94]Satan facts.
[117:25.10]Would you want a president?
[117:26.55]Would you want Jerma as president?
[117:28.59]When he doesn't even show up on time?
[117:30.35]He can't even drive.
[118:30.46]Are you tired of peel peel?
[118:32.17]Tired of peel peel?
[118:33.59]Tired of peel peel peel peel peeling peel peeling potatoes?
[118:37.95]Stop!
[118:38.69]Tired of peel peel peeling potatoes?
[118:41.39]Stop!
[118:42.99]Peeling potatoes?
[118:44.97]Stop!
[118:47.01]Peeling potatoes?
[118:48.61]Peeling potatoes?
[118:50.61]Peeling potatoes?
[118:51.93]Stop!
[118:55.77]What the fuck is he doing?
[118:58.60]What is he doing?
[118:59.06]Is he just fucking spamming shit?
[119:07.60]I'm running a stream here.
[119:09.84]God, man.
[119:15.00]Somebody needs to really... Somebody do...
[119:23.06]Are you really gonna stream?
[119:24.30]Or are you just gonna, like, leave?
[119:26.06]You're gonna walk away?
[119:26.90]You're gonna text people?
[119:28.16]Like, this is the most half-assed lazy stream I've seen in a long time.
[119:31.05]Don't say that about me.
[119:31.61]Don't you dare say that about me.
[119:33.01]Retract that statement now or I'm gonna be... I'm an expert of lazy streams.
[119:36.29]I know a lazy stream when I see a lazy... I have been very high energy.
[119:40.21]I've been talking.
[119:40.89]I've been... Hold on just a second.
[119:43.46]I've been... You want some proof, too?
[119:45.32]You're not gonna even walk.
[119:46.76]Oh, first chance you get, you're gonna steal someone's car.
[119:49.22]Lazy.
[119:49.74]No, I'm not.
[119:50.30]Shut up.
[119:52.37]Don't call me that.
[119:52.99]I'm gonna do something wicked interesting.
[119:54.73]Something crazy is gonna happen.
[119:55.78]Watch this.
[119:59.88]I'm not gonna steal that car.
[120:00.78]I'm gonna jump over it.
[120:03.30]Never seen that before in a fucking GTA streamer video.
[120:06.52]This guy.
[120:06.72]That's the laziest thing you could have thought of to prove me wrong.
[120:10.26]See, I hit that guy in the face.
[120:13.46]Oh, I got clipped by an ambulance.
[120:14.80]LOLs are going to be spamming that chat.
[120:17.74]Okay, good idea.
[120:18.74]Look at this, it's going to be funny.
[120:20.21]Watch how funny this is going to be.
[120:31.82]Hold on.
[120:32.04]It's not funny yet.
[120:32.84]Don't laugh.
[120:33.92]It's gonna be funny in a minute.
[120:35.76]Oh, no.
[120:36.16]Hold on.
[120:36.40]It's not funny.
[120:38.74]See, look at the chat.
[120:39.32]Everyone's fucking laughing.
[120:42.49]There are a lot of XDs and lols.
[120:53.56]I was like, oh, I'm so sorry.
[120:56.85]Alright, let's get into it.
[120:57.93]I want to do the balding one so bad.
[121:00.29]The balding one?
[121:01.27]Dude, you're already doing that 30.
[121:02.41]Guys, 30 over here.
[121:05.61]It's true.
[121:08.46]I'm starting to go gray.
[121:11.70]I'm getting really gray, brittle hair.
[121:14.14]You know what I mean?
[121:17.58]I gotta get Jess from Angel.
[121:19.15]No one can tell.
[121:23.35]It's Jess from Mangel.
[121:25.43]No one can tell.
[121:27.01]Jess from Mangel.
[121:29.06]That guy's fucking dead.
[121:32.72]You gonna blow by on these streets?
[121:34.58]These are MY streets.
[121:38.32]Oh wow.
[121:39.08]Like a minute later, it looks like you stole someone's car.
[121:41.71]Lazy streamer.
[121:42.69]Doesn't even want to walk.
[121:43.63]Watch this.
[121:44.19]Guy thinks he can blow by.
[121:46.19]Blow by on MY streets.
[121:50.63]He got away.
[121:52.07]He got away.
[121:52.61]Yeah, whatever.
[121:53.28]Fuck him.
[121:56.66]Ronco hairspray.
[121:57.56]This guy's got a bounty on him.
[122:01.78]Bingo!
[122:05.71]Bingo!
[122:08.97]Bingo!
[122:39.53]Okay, okay Did you just watch what just happened that was really funny
[123:02.01]Hold on, I promise I'll stream in a second.
[123:04.74]Hold on, that's important.
[123:05.52]Now I can text again.
[123:29.66]Alright, I'm going to get into it.
[123:31.32]This time, I need to look on the map, because I want to see what the bowling one is.
[123:35.88]Stunt Series 3, it doesn't even say what it is.
[123:39.32]Can I just go into my phone and pick it?
[123:42.56]I think I can, right?
[123:43.34]Like, job listing?
[123:49.31]No.
[123:50.67]Quick job.
[123:52.17]You're trying to impress me, I think?
[123:53.57]I wasn't here.
[123:55.52]Survival, Parachuting, Activity.
[123:57.00]Where is it?
[123:57.32]Stunt Series.
[123:57.86]Okay, here we go.
[123:58.74]Alone.
[123:59.68]Are you sure?
[124:00.20]I guess.
[124:05.57]Wow.
[124:05.91]Cancel on call.
[124:06.65]Okay, so now does that mean I can launch it?
[124:08.91]I can pick whatever I want, right?
[124:15.96]Play Pokemon Go.
[124:18.08]I can't do it.
[124:22.41]Okay, vehicle.
[124:23.57]German has a flip phone.

[124:46.65]Who am I betting at?
[124:47.33]Am I seriously doing this alone?
[124:53.30]What's going on?
[124:55.27]I couldn't, like, pick the fucking... I'm in a clown car!
[125:00.95]Who are these people?
[125:01.81]This is not what I wanted to do.
[125:12.86]But, uh, Dedo.
[125:15.17]Thank you, Dedo.

[130:45.23]Is it Wolverine in this game?
[130:46.57]The Wolverine update.
[130:48.15]Someone was supposed to be a monster, and you got really excited, and then you realized the update was terrible.
[130:53.01]Oh yeah, I already talked about that.
[130:54.51]I talked about how the last update was just lame.
[130:56.59]I didn't think it was fun at all.
[131:00.09]But, see, this is why you need to be in here, so we can stack the votes on whatever we want to do next.
[131:07.79]Hold on a second.
[131:08.33]Let me just open up my big mango iced tea.
[131:21.84]That was refreshing.
[131:31.52]It's like that was gross.
[131:33.75]I'm sorry.
[131:34.23]I apologize about that one.
[131:38.31]I apologize.
[131:43.25]Jesus Christ.
[131:48.72]Drink louder.
[131:49.38]I think I could probably do.
[131:50.52]I could probably do it louder.
[131:55.71]If I do it, it's going to hurt.
[131:58.08]No, actually, this is Arizona.
[132:00.32]Arizona mango.
[132:02.52]Oh, it's not an iced tea.
[132:03.28]This one was iced tea.
[132:04.54]This is Arizona iced tea.
[132:06.46]This one, on the other hand, is Arizona mucho mango fruit juice cocktail.
[132:13.63]99 cents.
[132:16.27]Now riddle me this.
[132:17.23]Let me ask you something.
[132:19.43]Yeah?
[132:20.47]I think maybe I've asked this before.
[132:22.65]Arizona iced tea.
[132:25.37]Last time we talked about this, I didn't really get a real clear answer, I don't think.
[132:30.78]99 cents for these huge ass cans.
[132:33.46]Yeah.
[132:34.60]How can it still be 99 cents?
[132:36.58]It's been like that for like 20 years.
[132:39.72]They have not raised their price in 20 years.
[132:42.87]Sewer water.
[132:44.19]You think it's made with sewer water?
[132:45.89]Yeah.
[132:47.85]You know, it could be.
[132:50.83]They backwash as well.
[132:53.07]Is that how they just don't raise their prices?
[132:55.24]Yeah.
[132:55.38]Have you had the watermelons?
[132:59.28]I had the watermelon iced tea.
[133:01.40]That guy just drove off.
[133:02.22]That guy just literally tried to drive himself off.
[133:04.95]He didn't even care.
[133:05.57]It's Arizona watermelon.
[133:08.49]Uh, I think I've had it before.
[133:11.41]And they try and trick you.
[133:12.27]There's one called Fruit Punch, and they taste the exact same.
[133:15.97]Huh.
[133:17.43]Well, corn syrup is dirt cheap.
[133:19.27]Yeah, I know, but then how come Coke is $1.30 a bottle?
[133:23.95]For, like, way less liquid.
[133:26.38]That's the branding.
[133:27.92]You're paying for a poop.
[133:29.16]So, like, if you get, like, a brisk iced tea in a bottle, that's much less that's inside of a Arizona.
[133:35.08]It's, like, $1.40.
[133:35.36]And can I please just not drive off the cliff?
[133:38.00]That'd be fucking fantastic.
[133:40.36]I'm causing so many problems.
[133:44.34]Oh, this guy is so mad right now at me.
[133:47.06]And somebody flew all the way across.
[133:53.96]We're always in sixth place.
[133:57.32]No, don't toggle the stunt cam.
[133:59.32]You're not cool enough to do that.
[134:03.29]Why does your stream title say number one ranked racer?
[134:07.99]Does it?
[134:09.23]Yeah.
[134:09.67]Did you change it to say that?
[134:13.15]Did you actually do that?
[134:16.08]I realized now that I could do that.
[134:17.84]Oh, I was going to say, what the fuck are you?
[134:19.36]Don't do that shit.
[134:20.88]Make me look bad.
[134:23.58]Jeremy, you make yourself look bad.
[134:26.11]You make yourself look bad.
[134:28.57]Look who's in first place, motherfucker.
[134:34.47]Oh, hold on.
[134:35.85]This guy's losing his wheel.
[134:37.57]He's losing his wheel.
[134:40.93]Don't fuck us both.
[134:44.98]Oh, look who just got in first place.
[134:48.20]If somebody guesses what that's from, I don't even know what I would do.
[134:53.57]Good luck.
[134:55.13]Stop slowing me down.
[135:16.60]I'm waiting for entries.
[135:18.70]I can't look.
[135:19.52]You have to shout out every word that's said in the chat.
[135:23.59]I'm in first place right now, dude.
[135:26.69]You punk.
[135:29.26]Someone says WWF.
[135:32.14]Yeah, somebody got it.
[135:32.86]Yep, no mercy.
[135:33.88]And I looked at the chat and that's why I'm not in first place.
[135:35.40]Damn.
[135:38.95]I'm still in first place, though.
[135:40.29]Why are you making excuses, dude?
[135:42.03]I'm still in first place.
[135:43.21]Excuses are for losers.
[135:44.51]Hey, dude, if I was playing this game, man, I would be blowing by you in first place.
[135:49.72]Oh, would you really?
[135:50.40]Because this guy in first place right now just had a little bit of an altercation there, but I got out on top.
[135:58.36]You don't even employ any strategy into your race.
[136:03.60]Ah, my face is bright fucking purple.
[136:05.96]I'm so angry.
[136:13.14]Yeah, I don't think you're in first place anymore.
[136:14.94]Not anymore!
[136:18.28]Maybe you should've slowed down for the, uh, the mini-golf.
[136:21.98]Wheel to stop turning.
[136:24.06]Don't worry, I'm right up this guy's ass.
[136:25.94]He ain't gonna get away.
[136:27.51]Oh, yeah.
[136:29.99]I gotta play smart.
[136:31.65]This guy's, lookit, this guy's kind of all over, he's gonna hit the thing.
[136:34.21]See, I didn't have to do that, so I'm gonna gain some ground here.
[136:35.99]I'm gonna gain a lot of ground.
[136:40.54]Okay, what's the deal with these textureless blocks?
[136:43.48]I don't know.
[136:47.40]Ooh, right up his ass.
[136:52.09]Come on, get up his ass.
[136:54.53]Get up this guy's ass.
[136:57.11]Okay, what happened there?
[136:58.75]What the fuck was that?
[137:00.88]He just like fucking teleported.
[137:02.86]Oh my god, game sucks.
[137:05.94]He ran into a wall and he teleported back.

[145:15.24]We're having a good time here.
[145:25.43]Okay.
[145:35.25]Check your phone, check your phone.
[145:36.79]Hey, you start in sixth, you're heading in sixth, you're right in the middle.
[145:48.82]You're not terrible, you're not great, you're just an average guy, right?
[145:53.97]That's how I look at it.
[145:54.89]The glass is not half empty, the glass is not half full, the glass is right in the middle.
[146:06.11]You got just enough liquid to enjoy it.
[146:08.45]Hey, German, how full is this glass?
[146:10.29]Oh, right in the middle.
[146:11.05]Right in the middle.

[146:55.31]I'm not sure.
[146:59.20]I don't know.
[146:59.50]That was a photo finish.
[147:02.02]We'll have to find out in the end.
[147:13.40]What happened there?
[147:14.16]What do you think?
[147:14.55]I did it.
[147:16.21]Fifth place.
[147:20.88]I'm laughing at this guy in 9th who looks like he can't control his speed.
[147:25.74]He's just like swerving around.
[147:27.08]It's like a bike with a tire that's like all fucked up.
[147:29.92]Like he has some weird stipulation where he has to drive left and right.
[147:58.14]Bowling.

[148:30.14]Much love.
[148:42.26]Hi.
[148:44.09]It's me.
[148:44.49]It's Ster.
[148:45.37]Look, it's Ster.
[148:45.93]He's here.
[148:46.98]It's me.
[148:47.46]I hosted your stream on my channel.
[148:49.11]What, you just did?
[148:50.41]Yeah, so I'm saying hi to those people.
[148:52.61]Did you just host me on your stream?
[148:55.57]You gotta give me some warning, man.
[148:56.97]I gotta be prepared to be like, hey, what's going on, gamers?
[148:59.40]I'm doing that for you.
[149:00.58]I'm saying hello.
[149:02.34]I'm just hanging out.
[149:04.78]Now everyone knows where I am.
[149:06.56]Yeah, they do.
[149:14.05]We got the ranked number one GTA driver right now.
[149:17.83]Doing the new update.
[149:20.37]And I'm just trying to learn some skills.
[149:24.24]Learning some strats.
[149:25.66]You're not even playing.
[149:27.56]I know, that's why I'm just watching, dude.
[149:28.80]Trying to pick up on some strats.
[149:32.85]I'll tell you the strats.
[149:34.07]Welcome everybody from Starstream.
[149:35.98]Check this out.
[149:36.98]We're going to show you how to really get going in your life.
[149:39.44]So what you want to do is you want to pick... The vehicle needs to be the XO Proto Man from Mega Man X2.
[149:44.96]Well, that's Mega Man X8.
[149:46.05]Sorry, X80.
[149:46.55]There's 80 Mega Man Xs.
[149:48.91]And it's the Proto Man car.
[149:50.15]So because it's the Proto Man car, it's got to be red.
[149:51.93]And what you want to do is you want to accelerate...
[149:55.91]See, it says like 3, there's no audio.
[149:57.40]So what you want to do is you want to accelerate when it gets to 3, 2, 1.
[150:01.44]You want to hit the right trigger button on your controller.
[150:04.02]The right trigger button, if you're not sure, is located under your hand where your index finger would meet the top of your controller.
[150:10.93]So right there, we right trigger at the right time.
[150:13.45]And we're going to get a little bit of speed here.
[150:16.40]Just a little bit, and you want to get bounced around a little bit by these other morons.
[150:20.16]Because the amount of idiots in a GTA lobby is totally condescending you.
[150:25.91]I said the wrong word.
[150:27.07]I meant to say a coalition of you.
[150:28.63]A cantaloupe of you.
[150:31.25]Inside of how well you're going to do in that lobby.
[150:33.65]So depending on how good these... I'm just... I can't even fucking... Let's just go.
[150:37.81]I'm fucking winning this race.
[150:43.36]I can't get in the loop.
[150:44.54]Yeah, that's... You know what?
[150:47.78]That's what you wanted to say.
[150:48.68]No.
[150:49.69]Fuck it.
[150:50.63]We're gonna ruin this for everybody.
[150:52.77]Are you ready?
[150:53.25]Whoa.
[150:54.47]We're gonna ruin this fucking whole thing.
[150:59.53]We're having fun until you start using... Whoa, hold on a second.
[151:02.43]I just bumped that guy.
[151:05.73]Oh, God.
[151:06.29]I can't control the car.
[151:08.19]I can't control it.
[151:12.37]Where the fuck did that guy come from?
[151:16.03]Okay, that guy is a mystery for sure.
[151:17.73]I'm just like staring.
[151:20.40]How am I passing all these people?
[151:23.64]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[151:33.89]We're good.
[151:36.91]Oh, got that guy.
[151:43.36]This one probably is one of the better ones, but it's kind of a one-trick pony.
[151:46.56]Once you do it once, the thrill is over.
[151:52.17]Saw that coming.
[151:54.43]That guy missed.
[151:57.65]I love watching them just cascade off into the distance.
[152:06.23]I want this guy to land on me.
[152:13.21]Like always.
[152:15.09]So how come you're not playing this right now?
[152:17.80]I can't.
[152:19.24]You could have already installed this game by the time you were ready to host the stream.
[152:27.18]Can you not be so rude?
[152:30.35]I'll try not to.
[152:35.11]Yeah, once they open this up to the public, once people can actually make levels, you'll probably see the F-Zero levels, you'll probably see
[152:43.21]Like Mario Kart levels and shit.
[152:45.11]It's gonna be awesome.
[152:51.78]I wanna do the one where you jump through the turbines.
[152:53.36]That one should be so funny, but... Everyone wants to pick the same one every time.
[153:05.38]Everybody wants to do the same race every time.
[153:08.74]Here comes this one again.
[153:09.56]Here comes this voice.
[153:12.05]Doesn't want to stream.
[153:14.05]You're a grumpy grandfather.
[153:15.47]Hey.
[153:17.25]Rainbow Road.
[153:17.95]That would be awesome.
[153:21.37]We lost a couple of people down there.
[153:22.75]Good.
[153:23.33]That means I can pass them.
[153:27.89]I did it with those people behind me?
[153:29.11]I guess.
[153:31.40]I don't know.
[153:34.10]You know, you could just not ride the fucking meat.
[153:35.88]Just block them.
[153:37.46]Nope.
[153:37.68]Don't block them.
[153:39.76]You already went by.
[153:41.78]You're really fond of that voice.
[153:43.06]I know, I don't know why.
[153:43.78]I like it a lot for some reason.
[153:46.46]That is like the grumpy grandfather, like Carl Pewterschmidt.
[153:55.49]Wow, so you just like rip somebody else's work off?
[154:02.77]At least we didn't get sixth, guys.
[154:03.93]We got eighth.
[154:07.89]I'm an impressionist, more like you're abusing copyrights.
[154:11.71]I thought that was just like, shut up.
[154:16.85]Hey, pull like your underwear out of your ass.
[154:19.23]It's bothering you.
[154:19.93]Sounds like it's bothering you.
[154:23.47]My underwear is right where I like it.
[154:52.08]Fifteen hundred bucks.
[154:53.16]For eighth place.
[154:53.80]Alright, I'm saying, like, goodbye.
[154:59.28]I'm saying, like, alright, see you later.
[155:01.60]I'll talk to you later.
[155:03.67]We're gonna try to do the phone number exchange.
[155:06.19]Wish me luck.
[155:08.89]What?
[155:09.73]I'm going for a phone number exchange here.
[155:13.07]Wish me luck.
[155:13.67]What?
[155:15.63]I'm going for a phone number exchange here.
[155:19.53]Okay?
[155:21.19]Okay?
[155:22.44]Wish me luck.
[155:26.43]But first I need to vote for this one.
[155:27.63]Good luck.
[155:29.69]How do I type to all chat?
[155:35.57]Oh, you're trying to get the numbers from the people in the race.
[155:40.74]That makes sense.
[155:43.58]Vote that one.
[155:44.28]Vote Turbine.
[155:47.20]Don't you want to try to get hit by the fucking blades?
[155:50.38]Don't you want to play pinball?
[155:56.46]wait what I hope jeremy gets this number so he can stop being such a needy of a friend and like actually have something decent in his life for once
[156:16.04]That way I don't always have to be the one to pick up the pieces when they're all on the ground.
[156:20.14]Alright, wish me luck.
[156:22.04]The amount of times I've had Jerma call me at 4 in the morning, crying.
[156:28.47]I don't cry, come on.
[156:30.83]I mean, maybe once.
[156:34.13]It's like a weird hiccup thing that you do.
[156:36.57]Yeah, a weird hiccup thing.
[156:37.77]Kind of like this.
[156:43.66]Like that?
[156:44.78]Yeah.
[156:47.09]Oh, fucking, I must have ripped my cord out of my... Alright, okay.
[156:53.53]Where's my auto?
[156:54.87]Where's auto?
[156:57.07]Oh, here I go, auto.
[156:59.32]Why does nobody want to do this?
[157:00.96]We didn't even get it either.
[157:02.28]Fucking quit.
[157:02.82]This one sucks.
[157:05.90]Like, really.
[157:06.58]This one is not even fun.
[157:19.03]I'm sad that Jeremy doesn't cry.
[157:21.49]Everybody cries.
[157:24.90]Solo504, thank you for four months.
[157:27.96]Everyone dies.
[157:30.64]Somebody that tells you that they don't cry, that's a person that I can't trust.
[157:34.20]I don't trust that person.
[157:36.42]Everybody cries.
[157:37.15]I don't care who you are.
[157:39.37]The Rock?
[157:40.41]The Rock cries.
[157:41.61]Definitely.
[157:46.57]I don't know about that.
[157:53.31]What's he got to cry about?
[157:55.03]Just don't let him see you cry.
[157:59.13]We're going to take a break from the stunts.
[158:00.96]I want to get on the plane.
[158:02.04]Because I want to do this thing.
[158:03.44]Follow the longest distance with a parachute.
[158:05.72]I'm going to try that.
[158:08.48]All you got to do is get inside of a car.
[158:10.66]And make it happen.
[158:14.42]What?
[158:16.10]What?
[158:21.67]Destroy special cargo.
[158:22.63]It seems like there's a lot of stuff in this game now.
[158:24.74]They've added, like, a bunch of little small updates.
[158:26.34]Alright, that's what I wanted.
[158:29.00]I'm sorry, I'm just laughing at the fact that you're getting a phone number from a 50-year-old guy right now and you don't even know it.
[158:35.27]That'd be funny.
[158:36.45]Don't kill me.
[158:37.79]It fucking killed me.
[158:40.63]He'll kill you.
[158:47.38]That's a step on his face.
[158:48.68]He wants blood.
[158:51.54]He's out for blood.
[158:52.83]That's not a good idea, buddy.
[158:54.45]You're talking about a guy with a ball bat.
[158:56.11]Yeah.
[158:58.81]Smart move.
[158:59.61]50-year-old guy.
[159:05.93]Okay, he's gonna get over here.
[159:21.21]What the hell are you guys doing down here?
[159:24.59]What, what?
[159:25.35]Is something wrong?
[159:26.91]Can I get a sip?
[159:35.91]Give me that bottle!
[159:36.97]It's mine.
[159:37.65]I hit the guy right in the chest.
[159:43.69]Alright, would you rather get hit in the face with a baseball bat or directly in the sternum?
[159:48.89]I don't know.
[159:50.02]I think I'd rather get hit in the face.
[159:53.78]I want no teeth.
[159:54.62]That guy just got blipped.
[160:00.92]What are they doing?
[160:01.50]Drugs, probably.
[160:02.35]Where am I going?
[160:05.99]I hear explosions now.
[160:07.17]That's no good.
[160:12.27]Where the fuck is this?
[160:14.62]Where is it?
[160:15.12]There's one there.
[160:15.78]There's one back here, closer.
[160:17.66]Let's get this one.
[160:21.58]Whatever, give me a car, give me a car.
[160:24.61]What's a sternum?
[160:26.43]It's like the center of you, right in the chest.
[160:27.97]Right in the middle of your chest where your body meets in the middle of your body.
[160:35.19]I fucking hate when I'm stuck out here like this.
[160:37.67]Oh, nice sellout streamer with the donation amounts at the bottom right.
[160:41.11]What?
[160:41.67]What are you talking about?
[160:45.53]Donation amounts?
[160:46.45]I think you were on the map when I said that.
[160:50.43]No?
[160:52.79]Yeah, super super somebody 3,000 feet.
[160:56.23]Really someone gave you 3,000 feet.
[160:58.96]Oh, super super Dino, thank you for the 3,000 feet.
[161:01.10]Appreciate it.
[161:03.40]You're currently the top, uh, top donator with your 3,000 feet.
[161:08.22]Just over the top of the next guy with zero feet.
[161:10.62]Yeah.
[161:17.28]Somebody's raining hell.
[161:18.28]I just want to follow the longest distance.
[161:28.66]Just let me fall the longest distance.
[161:30.18]Leave me alone.
[161:30.98]He's following me.
[161:35.56]Get out.
[161:36.26]Get in.
[161:43.65]Alright.
[161:44.15]Fall the longest distance with the parachute.
[161:45.77]With the parachute before opening it.
[161:47.97]Okay.
[161:49.31]We just gotta go up and just fall.
[161:51.25]Easy enough.
[161:51.65]3,000 feet though.
[161:55.11]That's a lot of feet to beat.
[161:57.34]That's like a... What's a mile?
[161:58.80]Like... 80 feet?
[162:02.78]80 feet is a mile.
[162:07.06]I don't think that's correct.
[162:08.72]Well, the metric is different.
[162:10.80]Alright, so we gotta fall before opening it.
[162:13.60]So we gotta get as close to the bottom as we can.
[162:19.52]Alright.
[162:21.38]We're just gonna go all the way up, as high as we can go.
[162:23.24]And just free fall.
[162:29.18]Are we almost there?
[162:29.84]I think we might be almost there.
[162:34.36]A mile is 69 feet.
[162:37.71]I don't think that's true.
[162:42.05]Okay, are we almost at the highest point?
[162:45.97]We might be there already.
[162:48.07]Now, here we go.
[162:48.55]Ready?
[162:50.05]Just gotta fall before opening our parachute.
[162:51.90]3, 2, 1, let's go.
[162:59.31]Current attempt.
[163:01.45]100 feet.
[163:02.49]200 feet.
[163:05.47]This guy just got 7,000 feet.
[163:06.55]I'm not even gonna get close.
[163:12.42]Where did he do this from?
[163:13.52]Maybe I will.
[163:14.02]Okay, okay, okay.
[163:17.84]2,000.
[163:17.86]2,500.
[163:19.96]Puppet!
[163:28.73]That was such a go- How- 7,200 feet?
[163:32.75]That almost seems impossible.
[163:38.56]That's- On- What?
[163:42.74]Do you need to be in like a plane?
[163:46.42]What the flying fuck was that guy doing?
[163:49.24]That was a pedestrian.
[163:50.22]That wasn't even like a guy in the game.
[163:51.72]That was like just a random AI.
[164:04.65]Horizontal movement?
[164:07.47]Yeah, is it like a... Like a wingsuit?
[164:11.77]So what, am I just gonna throw myself?
[164:14.01]Alright, well, let's find it.
[164:20.34]Loser!
[164:20.78]I was just gonna say that.
[164:23.30]Loser.
[164:23.98]You're a loser.
[164:24.90]Let's go to like the beach or something?
[164:30.00]Like somebody was saying the beach could be higher.
[164:33.87]Let's go, like, over here.
[164:34.73]I don't think the beach is 4,000 feet higher.
[164:37.85]Feet higher than that?
[164:39.27]Who knows?
[164:57.72]How was the number exchange?
[165:00.57]We're still talking about it.
[165:02.37]We gotta wait and see.
[165:06.14]Who knows?
[165:08.64]Only two minutes left.
[165:09.78]Oh, fuck.
[165:10.34]He's right.
[165:16.21]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[165:23.15]How did he get 7,200 feet?
[165:29.30]I'm gonna- don't even get that high by the time.
[165:31.20]So I'm just gonna fly forward too.
[165:33.54]Maybe I can just like throw myself forward going like a hundred miles per hour?
[165:36.64]How did that guy do that?
[165:43.37]Is that even- Is that guy using cheaters?
[165:45.25]Yeah, I think you need a jet.
[165:46.61]Is that guy cheating?
[165:49.93]Yeah, you probably do.
[165:52.09]Yeah, you absolutely do.
[165:53.09]I- I have Googled to this.
[165:54.83]Oh.
[165:55.17]So what, do you just shoot yourself into the air?
[165:59.59]You couldn't get yourself very high.
[166:01.71]Like, way, way higher than a helicopter will get.
[166:04.34]Well, in that case... Why even spawn the helicopters, then?
[166:10.02]Well, we're just gonna fucking throw our... We're going to bowl ourselves.
[166:12.92]Oh, because this game is pay-to-win, you think?
[166:14.00]You think that because this game is pay-to-win... We are just... I'm gonna lose its altitude as fast as I can here.
[166:18.91]I bought a shock card and got a jet.
[166:21.57]Oh, I win all the events.
[166:23.21]Ha ha!
[166:23.97]We're gonna play human skiing.
[166:25.53]Human fucking skeeball.
[166:27.03]On the highway.
[166:27.53]Yeah, let's skin some humans.
[166:29.25]Watch this.
[166:32.05]You guys ready for human skeeball?
[166:34.86]Gonna get right down here on this highway.
[166:44.40]So what did I get for that?
[166:47.10]I came in third place.
[166:51.85]I don't know, you wasted five minutes.
[166:53.43]Human skee-ball, let's do it!
[167:04.98]That's... that sucked.
[167:10.24]That was so bad.
[167:11.24]Watch out!
[167:14.14]Watch out!
[167:14.46]There's a guy!
[167:14.82]There's a crazy guy on the highway with a gun!
[167:16.98]There's a fucking psycho on the highway!
[167:19.08]Everyone get out of his way!
[167:20.30]Oh shit.
[167:24.89]I'm sorry.
[167:26.27]I'm sorry.
[167:26.73]I didn't mean to.
[167:29.45]Lady, I'm gonna need your car.
[167:35.63]Oh shit, look out!
[167:37.50]Oh, lazy streamer can't go a second without someone's car.
[167:40.74]Shoot him!
[167:41.56]Oh, what the fuck?
[167:44.70]I got hit.
[167:45.72]I got hit, guys.
[167:46.38]Can you believe it?
[167:46.96]I got clipped.
[167:48.38]Hold on, who remembers this one?
[167:54.31]Hold on, hold on.
[167:56.43]Mr. Sneak Man.
[167:58.75]Oh yeah, the retarded kid that you made fun of.
[168:01.36]What?
[168:02.14]Mr. Sneak Man.
[168:04.40]Oh!
[168:04.78]Alright, I'm gonna do like one or two more races.
[168:09.30]Hopefully ones that we haven't done.
[168:13.30]Nah, I'm just gonna die.
[168:20.50]I'm going to die so I can spawn closer to one of these things.
[168:24.08]I know that was safety, man.
[168:26.60]Mr. Sneakman.
[168:28.98]Yeah, how dare you.
[168:29.72]Mr. Sneakman saved the Jerma Rumble.
[168:31.96]How dare you make fun of Mr. Sneakman.
[168:35.58]Hold on, hold on.
[168:36.30]Where am I going?
[168:39.72]Which one is this?
[168:40.74]I haven't done this one, I don't think.
[168:43.32]We'll do this one.
[168:47.08]And then I'm going to be done.
[168:50.83]This one leads into a race, maybe.
[168:53.54]We'll see.
[169:06.60]Snake man.
[169:12.58]My general consensus, you want to know, like, okay, so we're playing this for a few hours now, just about.
[169:18.41]It's a good update.
[169:19.83]It's fun.
[169:21.19]Are you ever going to play it again?
[169:22.23]Nope.
[169:22.35]I don't want that one.
[169:23.41]That's the dumb bike one.
[169:24.54]Should I actually download it?
[169:27.50]Uh, probably.
[169:29.68]That's over and under.
[169:30.36]I don't want to do that one again.
[169:33.88]Especially when you can make your own tracks.
[169:35.24]It might be fun to do.
[169:36.32]There's a guy with a tank back there, I think.
[169:43.64]Fairly certain I'm being followed by a guy in a fucking tank.
[169:53.53]Ooh, Gucci.
[169:56.21]Which one is this?
[169:58.77]Over and under again.
[170:00.57]Why is this the same one?
[170:01.45]What the fuck?
[170:07.01]I guess I could just make another lobby, but... Whatever.
[170:13.74]Whatever.
[170:17.64]Maybe it's just whatever one is currently... Somebody's running on this lobby?
[170:25.53]Yeah, it's like whoever's doing it in this lobby, it has to be.
[170:31.31]So how do I host my own?
[170:32.46]Because when I hosted my own before, only four people were in it.
[170:49.62]Where can I do it?
[170:50.28]Cruise, creator, jobs.
[170:51.46]It would be under jobs?
[170:52.44]No.
[170:54.20]It's not a job.
[170:58.38]Hey Jorma, do you know what would be a fun stream?
[171:00.28]What?
[171:01.78]One of these days, a Necropolis came out and it has multiplayer.
[171:06.23]I heard that game is not good.
[171:09.49]I think it'd be fun with friends.
[171:12.45]Yeah, I was going to play it, and the general consensus, everyone was like, don't.
[171:16.51]It is not fun.
[171:17.57]It's not good.
[171:19.03]It seems pretty shallow, but it has, and the fighting is a little clinky.
[171:26.06]It's a shame, because the idea for it looked really good, but I think we could still have a good old time in it.
[171:35.52]I have no jobs.
[171:36.68]Quick job.
[171:40.37]Race?
[171:41.15]Is it race?
[171:42.11]No.
[171:42.65]Stunt jobs?
[171:43.31]No.
[171:44.53]Would it be under race?
[171:48.43]It might be.
[171:51.43]No active race found.
[171:53.27]Host.
[171:58.53]Race type GTA rally non-con standard.
[172:00.87]No.
[172:01.79]What the fuck is it?
[172:16.78]Does it even, like, know where it is?
[172:19.12]In, like, the menu?
[172:20.04]I can't seem to locate it.
[172:21.64]It's in Rockstar Created Jobs.
[172:33.38]Okay.
[172:35.78]Rockstar Created.
[172:39.24]Oh, you're right.
[172:39.77]There you go.
[172:40.39]Look at that.
[172:40.97]Okay.
[172:42.51]So, which one?
[172:43.05]Duel?
[172:43.31]Duel?
[172:46.09]Two groups of crazed speed freaks take two routes around one track competing for one spot at the top of the podium.
[172:51.27]Okay.
[172:52.13]Yeah.
[172:52.57]Let's do this one.
[172:59.64]I would like to host it.
[173:06.28]Relapse.
[173:06.68]Yeah.
[173:07.34]Muscle car.
[173:08.86]Time of day.
[173:10.29]Noon.
[173:12.11]Custom vehicles on.
[173:13.45]Catch up on.
[173:14.25]Slipstream off.
[173:17.82]Destroy last place.
[173:19.32]No.
[173:20.98]Okay.
[173:21.48]Let's just go.
[173:27.41]Holy shit.
[173:27.93]I invited a million people.
[173:28.93]I didn't even see Nordic.
[173:34.45]Hey, Nordic.
[173:34.77]What's up, dude?
[173:36.31]How are ya?
[173:38.32]Hey.

[173:56.14]Oh, how are you?
[174:03.70]Why is nobody?
[174:04.18]Come on, accept it.
[174:10.34]Accept it.
[174:11.64]Why does nobody want to do it?
[174:12.62]Let's go.
[174:12.96]Am I really going to do this one by myself?
[174:27.88]Everyone's just like, nah.
[174:37.89]All right, am I gonna add people to do this?
[174:44.55]I might have to.
[174:50.68]Alright, my friends.
[174:51.66]From friends list.
[174:54.54]I have like three people.
[174:55.94]I have Boo, Italics, and Stealth.
[174:58.18]And you.
[174:58.61]Invite him.
[175:07.59]Where do I even go to look at that?
[175:13.33]I don't even know how to get to fucking my social club.
[175:22.07]What's the social club button?
[175:30.86]Oh, Papa John.
[175:32.26]Didn't invite Papa John yet.
[175:36.69]Alright, come on.
[175:40.83]Come on.
[175:42.59]This like just came out today or yesterday or something.
[175:46.03]And all you motherfuckers don't want to do it.
[175:48.39]You're passing on it.
[175:55.90]Somebody said it was a home button.
[175:58.24]Oh, here it is.
[175:58.68]Okay.
[175:59.98]Where am I, like... Okay, these people, like, want to be my friend.
[176:04.40]Okay, these people, like... All these people.
[176:08.48]I guess we'll just accept all of them.
[176:11.58]Literally accepting, like, every single fucking person.
[176:17.02]So... Okay, that person, like, doesn't exist.
[176:23.78]What?
[176:28.38]Okay.
[176:30.54]Okay.
[176:32.40]I can't add anybody.
[176:37.96]Interesting.
[176:38.72]Okay.
[176:39.36]So I added like four people.
[176:43.66]I'm not sure why it won't let me do any more.
[176:46.80]So... We'll just invite those people.
[176:53.07]So you can join off me if... I don't know why it's not letting me...
[176:56.88]Anyone?
[177:00.78]Oh, no.
[177:02.06]One minute to start?
[177:03.06]Come on.
[177:04.76]How do I invite people now?
[177:09.50]Can people just extend time?
[177:15.75]Confirm settings.
[177:16.59]Matchmaking.
[177:17.13]Okay.
[177:17.71]My friends.
[177:22.31]Well, everybody.
[177:23.85]Who you people are.
[177:27.02]Let's try adding more people.
[177:28.50]Or is the GTA not going to let me do it?
[177:34.85]This stream sucks.
[177:36.13]This stream sucks.
[177:39.87]There we go.
[177:41.37]Nope, nope.
[177:43.10]I can only add like two people at a time before the thing breaks.
[177:46.00]Alright, well, we can maybe get some more people in here now.
[178:00.28]This stream sucks.
[178:01.60]Stream sucks.
[178:06.61]Hey, look at that.
[178:07.43]Cool.
[178:07.57]Let's try it again.
[178:11.69]Friend request.
[178:15.23]Add.
[178:17.08]Add.
[178:18.34]Add.
[178:19.66]I got my limit.
[178:20.58]I got my two-person limit.
[178:24.06]Joining.
[178:24.46]Joining.
[178:29.06]This is going to take forever.
[178:41.86]Just add those people.
[178:43.84]Try it again.
[178:44.48]You call this a stream?
[178:47.92]I wouldn't feed this stream.
[178:49.80]No, no, no.
[178:50.16]Don't unfriend.
[178:50.92]Friend requests.
[179:01.83]I'm just going to keep doing that until we get a lobby with at least seven people in it.
[179:12.01]Social club.
[179:13.85]Give me a break.
[179:17.12]Give me a break, social club.
[179:20.42]Ugh, we didn't, whatever.
[179:22.14]Okay, we got like three people here.
[179:33.92]We want gameplay.
[179:35.74]I'm trying.
[179:36.40]We want a game.
[179:37.04]What do you think I'm doing?
[179:40.11]GTA micromanage your household.
[179:42.25]I wonder how many.
[179:44.87]I'm getting so many invites.
[179:49.49]GTA micromanage your household.
[179:53.22]I'd watch that.
[179:53.82]Okay.
[180:00.62]Have I switched sides?
[180:02.06]Oh, nope.
[180:05.19]It's like fucking... Nobody even in this one.
[180:07.51]1-2 lost 25.
[180:10.60]He's just trying to keep you guys in the stream long enough so he can trace the call.
[180:17.06]So is it actually 2v2 right now?
[180:20.10]I don't even know.
[180:20.62]Is this me versus this guy?
[180:29.69]Well, this is real boring.
[180:36.95]And I made you, like, self-conscious about it.
[180:41.25]Alright, we're going back.
[180:42.17]This is dumb.
[180:45.08]This is dumb.
[180:49.08]Find new session.
[180:53.28]Wow.
[180:54.38]Social club.
[180:55.92]Wow.
[180:58.10]What is with that shit?
[181:09.05]All right.
[181:14.11]There should be enough people online now that we can get a full lobby.
[181:20.78]And then I'm getting out of here.
[181:23.80]Resident sleeper.
[181:27.72]Resident sleeper.
[181:35.12]Jerma just hates his friends.
[181:36.50]No, I don't.
[181:38.58]Don't say that.
[181:47.99]Lazy streamer can't even finish race.
[181:52.95]We'll do it again.
[181:53.53]Alright, we gotta get a good one for this last one.
[181:57.27]It better work.
[182:00.20]I'm gonna be not a happy camper.
[182:07.12]okay the city air which one have we not done downtown loop no duel we didn't do dual east coast maze bank ascent nightlife plummet racing alley splits we didn't do threading the needle sure exploding cars and the screams of the dying can be a little distracting
[182:33.04]Okay, maybe this one.
[182:34.78]Did I do this one?
[182:35.37]Did I do threading the needle?
[182:36.17]I don't think not.
[182:36.77]There's not a check mark next to it.
[182:38.15]I haven't done it, right?
[182:41.97]Or turbine.
[182:43.17]Threading the needle or turbine.
[182:51.33]Turbine looks like it could cause a lot of problems.
[182:57.61]We'll do threading the needle.
[182:58.75]It's on bikes.
[183:06.86]Oh, fuck.
[183:07.42]Everybody's saying turbine.
[183:09.02]Wow.
[183:11.28]Oh, this one's already going.
[183:13.16]So we can do turbine after that.
[183:18.63]Turbine, all right.
[183:19.47]There's going to be a turbine.
[183:21.19]Don't you snort me.
[183:31.38]Hey, you'll be all right.
[183:35.31]Jeremy, did you get the digits?
[183:36.59]Oh, yeah, baby.
[183:37.73]What?

[183:55.04]The alligator.
[184:03.82]Snowman, tater, alligator.
[184:11.68]Let's go.
[184:19.04]Hit those streamers with that Germa caffeine.
[184:24.81]Germa six digits isn't a phone number.
[184:30.25]Germa is DTF and DNF.
[184:35.21]That's my favorite.
[184:36.23]That's my favorite one.
[184:39.23]There's a lot of people here, too.
[184:40.29]This is gonna be really, really bad.
[184:41.53]I got, like, a sprite shoot.
[184:50.84]A sprite shoot.
[184:54.96]You don't ever want to be in first place.
[184:57.30]Oh, it kills people in last place?
[185:00.17]Oh, jeez.
[185:01.01]Every 30 seconds, the person in last place dies.
[185:06.90]It's gonna be me.
[185:10.00]Oh, I just got so screwed.
[185:13.10]I got so screwed over.
[185:14.56]It's not me.
[185:20.08]There's a bunny hopping.
[185:27.57]Out of the way.
[185:30.01]Out of the way.
[185:30.75]No.
[185:34.05]Is it me?
[185:35.59]Are they talking about me?
[185:37.55]No, it's not me.
[185:38.53]I'm safe.
[185:42.79]What is it?
[185:50.73]That is freaking me out so much.
[186:01.44]These tiny little halls.
[186:05.23]What is this?
[186:06.23]I almost just said green smoke.
[186:11.13]I keep thinking it's me in last place.
[186:13.94]No, it's not.
[186:14.42]That guy went into another dimension.
[186:23.04]He really did.
[186:24.16]He dimension ported.
[186:32.25]What was that guy doing?
[186:33.81]He's red.
[186:39.09]Why is that guy red?
[186:39.87]Is he just flying around killing people?
[186:42.13]I don't get it.
[186:44.73]I don't know how I've gotten so far behind.
[186:57.74]Don't turn yet.
[186:58.42]Okay, baby.
[187:01.34]Did I say okay, baby?
[187:14.71]Don't lose it.
[187:16.55]I'm gaining on them.
[187:19.43]But they're right here.
[187:21.59]All it took was a little bit of finesse.
[187:24.39]And I'm right in the thick of things again.
[187:35.62]Sir is getting a pj under his desk Yeah, you have just been saying like periodically like oh, yeah You're not hearing the other side of what you've been saying
[187:48.39]I'm playing a fucking intense video game.
[187:51.55]You're sitting there like... You're sitting there.
[187:54.57]What about you driving around in GTA makes you have to go... Because it's really easy to lose and fucking smash into a wall in this race?
[188:05.84]Oh, it's really easy to be lewd, he says.
[188:07.94]Wow.
[188:09.68]Listen to this guy.
[188:11.78]Thinks he runs the goddamn world.
[188:14.60]Oh, if I was in this game, I'd be in first.
[188:16.54]Yeah, listen to this guy.
[188:17.18]This guy thinks he runs the damn world.
[188:18.92]That guy's way ahead in first place.
[188:27.62]Look at that star in first place, guys.
[188:31.38]Give me suck.
[188:34.25]Shut it.
[188:39.79]Almost fucked that up.
[188:43.69]Don't ask me how this guy is so far ahead.
[188:45.55]He's like five or six checkpoints ahead of me.
[188:49.83]I'm in second place.
[188:51.01]That means I'm going to explode.
[188:52.68]Eventually I will explode.
[188:54.00]Because I'm not in first.
[188:55.42]We're getting to the end.
[189:01.14]Now we can do the turbine.
[189:04.17]To close out the stream we'll do turbine.
[189:06.17]Hopefully with people that I added.
[189:10.87]We'll see.
[189:12.80]Let's see if that's possible.
[189:15.22]I love spectators.
[189:21.70]Yeah, it's over here.
[189:23.34]Where did he come from?
[189:24.02]I just gave him the finger.
[189:30.19]Oh, he gave him the finger.
[189:31.95]And he's going to pass me.
[189:32.85]Okay, cool.
[189:35.47]The guy that comes out of fucking nowhere, like teleports behind me, is passing me now.
[189:40.81]Does this bike just suck or what?
[189:46.29]I'm gonna explode.
[189:51.75]Shit!
[189:53.33]That's only three of us?
[189:55.36]This stupid fucking candy cane just blocked me!
[190:00.78]I-I gotta take somebody with me.
[190:04.62]Come on!
[190:05.66]Do your worst, game!
[190:07.62]I'm in third place anyways.
[190:09.35]Doesn't fucking matter.
[190:10.95]Fuck the world!
[190:12.29]I'm going my own way!
[190:29.80]I think it's six grand for that.
[190:30.77]Yeah, I think this would have been a real difference if not for that candy cane.
[190:36.41]Too bad that candy cane got in the way.
[190:43.42]Alright, let's, uh... If Turbine is not available to vote for and we don't get it, I'm leaving and we're gonna just make it.
[190:52.68]Uh, yeah.
[190:54.35]Just finish the goddamn race.
[191:00.36]If I don't see two, three... Okay, good.
[191:04.69]I think we're gonna... Well, yeah.
[191:05.61]We'll just go here.
[191:09.65]Hopefully it went through.
[191:13.39]You are at the finish.
[191:14.49]I still made third place.
[191:18.44]You know I'm counting stacks.
[191:20.48]You know I'm counting stacks.
[191:35.96]Can I invite people here?
[191:37.20]Let's just pull in friends playing GTA.
[191:43.49]Friends playing GTA, get in here if you got the invite.
[191:47.73]I got it.

[194:33.74]I gotta win this one.
[194:34.94]Ooh, yeah, get fucked by the monster truck.
[194:41.29]There's a guy on a bike behind me.
[194:42.41]Brake!
[194:45.58]I just fucking got him in first place.
[194:47.22]Are you serious?
[194:48.96]No, the fucking minivan just flipped me.
[194:53.85]Where?
[194:59.29]Alright, you can't just keep driving into the... What are you doing?
[195:10.16]Why would you stop there?
[195:12.38]Why would you stop...
[195:19.43]Oh no, here come the blades.
[195:20.79]Here comes the most extreme elimination challenge.
[195:26.40]Oh my goodness, this is gonna be fucked up.
[195:29.48]I got clipped.
[195:32.48]Here we go.
[195:33.13]Shit.
[195:37.59]This one's fucking crazy.
[195:41.39]I am somehow still in fifth place.
[195:44.67]Don't ask me how I did this.
[195:53.50]Look at these guys.
[195:55.28]I'm about to cross paths.
[195:57.04]Yeah, about to cross the streams.
[195:59.00]Thankfully I didn't get hit.
[196:01.45]Wow, that was close.
[196:02.73]That was really close.
[196:07.57]He's just gonna catch the edge.
[196:13.74]Oh shit!
[196:15.40]No!
[196:17.60]No!
[196:20.00]No!
[196:20.66]Flip it!
[196:22.63]Oh.
[196:22.99]My.
[196:23.49]God.
[196:23.93]You stupid asshole.
[196:25.81]Now I understand why you have a bike.
[196:28.53]Because you won't get hit by the turbines.
[196:32.03]That's why you choose a bike.
[196:34.15]So they were actually smart.
[196:35.29]I'm the dumb one.
[196:35.89]I have a huge target.
[196:42.64]Bad bot style.
[196:53.21]Got fucking clipped.
[196:54.47]I'm gonna get clipped again up here.
[196:55.45]I can already feel it.
[196:56.19]I can see it around a 10 landing.
[197:05.56]What do you know?
[197:06.00]We're in sixth place.
[197:06.96]I'm gonna knock this guy off.
[197:08.10]See ya.
[197:09.84]Sorry.
[197:18.44]Really?
[197:20.19]Nice AI scripted person that came out.
[197:23.34]Nice event scripting.
[197:27.16]This guy was part of the game's engine.
[197:29.78]This was a story mission.
[197:30.84]He was about to back up and be like, Yo!
[197:32.52]Get the fuck in the car, bro!
[197:40.40]We're in sixth again.
[197:41.12]That's right.
[197:44.01]Remember, we're in the middle of the glass.
[197:47.17]Don't fill it up.
[197:48.31]Don't spit it out.
[197:55.21]Losing control.
[197:58.05]Got it together.
[197:58.59]We're fine.
[197:59.49]Fifth place.
[198:00.11]Somebody died.
[198:01.35]Something horrible happened to a person.
[198:03.61]In fifth.
[198:04.63]So now I get his spot.
[198:11.32]Hug this wall.
[198:14.20]Return of double death.
[198:15.32]Are you serious?
[198:19.06]Get out of here.
[198:21.63]And somehow he's still in front of me.
[198:26.27]No!
[198:26.99]You just fucked us both!
[198:29.25]You did it to us both!
[198:31.25]How could you?
[198:33.15]How could you do that?
[198:34.91]Fuck you!
[198:36.07]I'll do it to you too.
[198:41.69]A guy with like the fucking 1910 buggy flies by.
[198:44.39]This guy's still in it.
[198:55.83]I'm sorry.
[198:56.98]I'm sorry.
[198:57.50]Go back to the fucking 20s.
[199:06.50]That guy's watching the stream.
[199:08.38]Probably.
[199:12.29]Get out of the way.
[199:16.01]And we're still... Okay.
[199:17.63]There are people turning around and driving into me.
[199:20.25]And I'm in sixth place.
[199:21.17]Still.
[199:21.81]Still.
[199:23.79]Like this guy.
[199:24.37]This guy's coming for it.
[199:25.61]You missed it.
[199:26.39]You missed your opportunity.
[199:33.37]You had a chance.
[199:34.09]It's hard to stay in this spot.
[199:41.89]I'm going to get hit.
[199:43.55]Fuck.
[199:46.55]Thankfully, it didn't do very much.
[199:48.03]And I'm still... I haven't gone anywhere.
[199:55.75]Oh, hug it, hug it, hug it, hug it, hug it, hug it.
[199:57.85]There you go.
[200:01.29]The buggy was just going to work, you monster.
[200:03.48]I feel like I'm way too far away from first and way too far away from last.
[200:11.78]No one's ever going to catch up to me, and I'm never going to catch up to anyone.
[200:14.22]At least I get to go through the tubes again.
[200:25.10]Those are my favorite.
[200:26.78]This has been like eight laps.
[200:28.80]No, two.
[200:29.34]It's a long track, though.
[200:35.97]This is a long one.
[200:43.77]The checkpoint sound reminds me of the thing.
[200:45.81]It really does.
[200:48.19]That, like, glomp.
[200:49.95]Glomp.
[200:52.09]That's a very good observation.
[200:53.97]Nice pick.
[201:01.13]Alright, let's get knocked into place again.
[201:07.59]He's gonna knock me right in.
[201:09.71]Oh, no.
[201:10.21]Like I said, last second he ripped over and tried to go straight.
[201:14.29]I saw what he was doing.
[201:17.14]Womp.
[201:18.34]Womp.
[201:19.34]Womp.
[201:31.14]Here he goes.
[201:31.72]Oh, you did it.
[201:34.10]Here comes the thing.
[201:39.13]Watch it.
[201:41.67]Watch out for this one.
[201:45.51]Did this play a guitar riff?
[201:48.25]Did he do that?
[201:49.57]Or did the game do that?
[201:52.90]Probably his... Anybody else in the game?
[201:56.36]Probably his horn.
[201:58.16]Oh.
[202:02.69]Good game.
[202:05.87]Six o'clock.
[202:10.50]Not six o'clock.
[202:11.38]I like that guy's key lime pie outfit.
[202:23.64]Alright, let's take a look.
[202:25.05]Let's see if there's...
[202:28.04]If one catches my eye and it's like, we're doing that one, then I'll do it.
[202:31.91]But if not, then that's going to be it.
[202:43.51]Did I 100% Anarchute?
[202:44.19]Yeah.
[202:46.13]Yeah.
[202:47.51]Of course I did.
[203:00.55]The stream is ending?
[203:04.97]Yeah.
[203:07.33]Maybe.
[203:08.95]I want to see if... A good one that we haven't done.
[203:15.46]City air.
[203:16.54]Do we do city air?
[203:18.50]No, I haven't done city air.
[203:21.42]This is one of the only ones I haven't done.
[203:23.29]So, we're going to have to do it.
[203:26.01]Stream is staying on.
[203:30.31]Sorry I slammed into you head first.
[203:31.99]They should really put up a stop sign there.
[203:46.73]Woke up 10 minutes ago.
[203:49.37]I'm about to go to bed.
[203:51.61]Come on, honey.
[203:56.13]Let's go.
[203:57.32]To bed?
[203:58.74]Yeah.
[204:03.83]That's what I'm going to do.
[204:04.47]That's my plan.
[204:09.39]Rocket League or Riot?
[204:10.63]I don't play Rocket League, unfortunately.
[204:12.67]Sorry.
[204:25.64]If any of you guys that didn't get to play just invited all the people that I just randomly grabbed.
[204:32.25]Maybe one of you guys can take the last spot.
[204:38.17]This guy's not in here.
[204:39.64]Get in here.
[204:42.30]Get in here.
[204:42.86]Trevis.
[204:46.10]Thanks, Trevis.
[204:46.94]Thank you, Trevis.
[205:05.51]Welcome to the group.
[205:09.39]Where we hang out and drink bottles in bags.
[205:16.24]This car sucks.
[205:21.72]All these cars suck.
[205:26.13]I'm gonna wear the junk food shirt.
[205:36.99]How do I destroy him?
[205:39.40]Well, you drive people off the cliff.
[205:44.40]That's the best way to do it.
[205:53.43]God damn it.
[205:54.25]I can never do it in time.
[206:00.65]City air.
[206:02.35]This will be the last one.
[206:06.25]Oh, one more.
[206:07.99]This one looks actually pretty ridiculous.
[206:21.26]Oh, no.
[206:21.68]The guy in the sedan just, like, fucked me up.
[206:25.58]Well, we're in last place again.
[206:27.08]No, no.
[206:28.16]That guy stopped.
[206:30.64]That guy's having trouble.
[206:32.66]That guy's having more trouble than us.
[206:33.90]We're good.
[206:37.68]Got some speed now.
[206:42.62]Wow!
[206:43.94]Pile up, pile up.
[206:45.96]Don't want to get near that.
[206:47.36]What is this tube?
[206:51.99]Oh, goodness.
[206:56.27]Watch out for this guy.
[206:56.93]This guy's fucking out of control.
[207:02.77]Jeez.
[207:05.80]What?
[207:08.16]What is going on?
[207:13.29]Holy crap.
[207:17.29]Don't drive into me.
[207:23.01]Damn, this one is probably the best one so far.
[207:30.94]Shit.
[207:31.18]I'm gonna go first person with this one.
[207:40.89]Bang!
[207:43.09]That wasn't that big.
[207:46.65]Really?
[207:47.53]Don't... I don't understand why they keep stopping us.
[207:55.47]That's what I deserve.
[207:56.43]I deserve that.
[207:58.69]Oh, no.
[207:59.35]I'm not gonna make this.
[208:02.09]Saved.
[208:03.63]Saved!
[208:04.57]Saved!
[208:09.52]Ah.
[208:11.09]Oh well.
[208:14.35]Paul Bearer is German on A5 in 20 years.
[208:16.53]I hope.
[208:17.27]I would love to be that guy.
[208:28.70]Oh, we're all the way back at the end.
[208:30.86]The drifting is in this.
[208:31.82]We can drift this guy.
[208:44.12]Let's see, where is he?
[208:45.53]Where is he?
[208:47.43]Where's his car?
[208:50.79]I want to see it.
[208:54.33]Oh, he's gone.
[208:57.29]Drafting.
[208:58.25]Drifting.
[209:06.86]I can't fucking...
[209:15.46]Front flip.
[209:16.48]Double front flip.
[209:17.46]Landed it.
[209:18.34]We're good.
[209:23.66]Is this just a drop?
[209:26.20]Oh, no.
[209:26.76]It's the spikes.
[209:29.30]Fuck it.
[209:29.58]This guy's done.
[209:36.95]Dude, I am attached to this guy's car.
[209:43.47]Me and this guy were one.
[209:51.12]He went so fast.
[209:54.32]Don't do that.
[209:54.92]Not enough time.
[209:58.30]He zipped around like a fucking tube of toothpaste.
[210:02.95]Shooting into a ball.
[210:08.07]What?
[210:10.77]A tube of toothpaste shooting into a ball.
[210:15.62]That doesn't make any sense.
[210:19.85]It's hard to come up with words when I'm driving, huh?
[210:24.75]Oh, good di- Nice try!
[210:26.05]Nice try!
[210:45.90]I'm having fun avoiding people driving the other direction.
[210:53.34]This is a fun game called Avoid the People Trying to Sabotage You.
[210:58.89]Look at these two.
[210:59.45]These two guys are in cohorts.
[211:01.45]Yeah, come down here.
[211:07.53]Come down here and say it to my face.
[211:10.91]I dare ya.
[211:18.06]Yeah, you cowards!
[211:27.61]Co-co-hoods.
[211:28.61]What did I say?
[211:29.05]Co-co-herds?
[211:36.48]Yogurt.
[211:42.81]Just do, like, a front flip.
[211:44.25]Get the fucking extra points.
[211:46.74]Perfect landing.
[211:47.82]10 out of 10.
[211:48.46]Cahoots.
[211:56.64]That's a word.
[211:57.22]I was right.
[212:02.92]Watch out for the fucking bee.
[212:11.37]I'm definitely not going to be in last place.
[212:14.37]What?
[212:14.95]Waiting for... Oh, hey.
[212:16.60]Come on.
[212:22.24]Come on.
[212:25.54]It's not fair.
[212:26.84]It's just not fucking fair.
[212:32.07]Dude's just sitting there.
[212:33.91]Waiting.
[212:40.50]Look at these guys in cahoots.
[212:50.00]He's waiting.
[212:50.54]He's trying to time it.
[212:51.34]He's trying to time it.
[212:51.98]I thought he was going to hit the brakes.
[212:59.86]It looked like he was going to just jam on them.
[213:09.24]Backflip.
[213:21.30]Hey, we all came in last place.
[213:22.76]It doesn't count.
[213:26.82]Dude, these four... Look at that.
[213:27.86]There's like four cars right there.
[213:29.26]We were all in last.
[213:36.80]Did not finish.
[213:37.50]Did not finish.
[213:38.18]Did not finish.
[213:38.86]Did not finish.
[213:39.54]Did not finish.
[213:42.24]God damn it.
[213:44.78]That was fun.
[213:54.24]Okay, somebody just said, Jeremy, you're at the bottom of the glass.
[213:57.76]Yeah.
[213:58.68]I am.
[213:59.08]I'm the last sip.
[214:01.70]I'm the last sip that nobody drinks.
[214:04.78]You know when you take, when you drink like a drink and you get to the last sip and you're just like, yeah, that's gross.
[214:08.69]I don't want that.
[214:09.27]That's me.
[214:11.05]And you leave it there.
[214:12.23]Or you just like, just dump it in the sink.
[214:25.18]Okay, we gotta do one more.
[214:26.30]Duel.
[214:27.38]We haven't done duel.
[214:28.52]This is another one.
[214:29.64]Either soccer or duel.
[214:30.72]I don't care which one it is.
[214:31.66]I haven't done either one.
[214:37.49]You're all backwash.
[214:38.45]I don't know which one it's gonna be.
[214:49.46]You're the swill.
[214:52.86]Jeremiah is the leftover powder from the chocolate milk that's still in the glass.
[214:59.75]True.
[215:10.06]There's a lot of people here for this one.
[215:11.42]This should be good.
[215:15.74]Is this three one mores?
[215:16.92]Yeah, it is.
[215:22.15]Technically, it is, but these ones I haven't done keep coming up.
[215:25.73]Did I miss anybody during that nonsense?
[215:34.18]No.
[215:34.48]Okay, good.
[215:39.58]You know what I used to do?
[215:41.22]I used to take the chocolate milk powder, and I'd get a glass of milk.
[215:45.84]I'd take the powder, and I would just grab, you know, like a little teaspoon of it,
[215:51.94]just drizzle it into the glass of milk don't mix it up just get it so it sits on top like a lily pad so there's a bunch of powder with a little bit of like gross mud powder underneath it and it's sitting on the top and I would just like drink that and like chew it up and drink it and then I would stay I wouldn't drink the whole thing and I mean I'd go like okay take that that was like one sip take another small little teaspoon dust it on there
[216:17.48]Wait for it to get the little muddy, you know, mud texture.
[216:20.44]Sip that up, drink it, chew it up a little bit.
[216:25.66]That's what I used to do when I was young.
[216:28.59]Don't do that anymore.
[216:29.31]I'm an adult.
[216:32.05]I don't do that.
[216:32.57]Adults don't do that.
[216:40.29]What a psycho.
[216:41.09]Alright, we're doing this dumb fucking popsicle car.
[216:46.63]Cheeseburger car, whatever the hell it is.
[216:59.74]Wait, where am I?
[217:10.19]Better win this race.
[217:16.81]Better win the race.
[217:25.77]Is it wrong to be a psycho?
[217:28.55]That's not a psycho thing to do.
[217:36.64]Yeah, the burger car.
[217:38.26]It's gonna happen, though.
[217:42.83]Double zero.
[217:47.45]Somebody always fucks it up right in the beginning.
[217:56.25]I'm going for a win here.
[218:03.29]Don't be a fool.
[218:06.34]Play smart.
[218:10.96]I got cash on this one.
[218:14.76]I'm wedged in.
[218:16.47]Don't wedge us in.
[218:20.43]I might not be going fast enough.
[218:23.03]Oh, heavens to Betsy.
[218:23.99]Oh, that was close.
[218:30.65]This teleport... I don't trust that guy.
[218:35.50]Get me away from him.
[218:38.52]Get that motherfucker away from me.
[218:40.18]Do not come near me, dude.
[218:42.74]That guy's a bad omen.
[218:52.25]Second place.
[218:52.69]Who's in first?
[218:53.27]Who's this guy in fucking first place?
[218:54.43]I should've picked a faster car.
[219:01.38]Am I ever gonna catch this guy?
[219:02.96]Hopefully he makes him- Oh no, not my Bane!
[219:06.80]Not the one thing I can't do.
[219:12.85]I can't do it!
[219:13.27]I did it!
[219:13.79]But I didn't!
[219:14.31]I can't!
[219:15.63]Fuck!
[219:17.73]No!
[219:23.44]I'm so just short of these.
[219:25.14]All right.
[219:33.52]We're okay.
[219:36.15]Don't turn.
[219:36.87]I didn't turn.
[219:37.79]I promise.
[219:43.03]There's an explosion.
[219:43.83]I'm not going to win.
[219:55.81]I'm not going to win, but I'm not going to lose.
[220:00.88]We're going to go to the right this time.
[220:02.22]We went left last time, right?
[220:03.34]No, we went right.
[220:03.92]I'm going to push this way.
[220:05.18]I don't even remember.
[220:06.63]That was so long ago.
[220:08.15]That could have been like three years ago.
[220:21.19]Just be careful.
[220:22.77]Wait for someone to make a mistake.
[220:24.83]And be the guy that doesn't make the mistake.
[220:27.29]That's all you gotta do.
[220:35.03]Short-term memory problems.
[220:42.48]Second place, you're the first loser?
[220:45.00]Wait, what did you say?
[220:46.32]Second place means you're just the best loser.
[220:48.64]Well, I'd rather be the best loser than the worst loser.
[220:51.63]Alright.
[220:54.53]I somehow lost place.
[221:02.09]No, I don't want to be a half-assed empty guy.
[221:04.81]I want to be a half-assed full.
[221:06.05]Let's see if this guy fucks it up.
[221:18.16]No, I didn't fuck it up, but I drove right into the fucking stupid door.
[221:22.64]Thing.
[221:23.06]Whatever the fuck it is.
[221:24.22]Ah, I'm gonna lose.
[221:27.48]Barely made that.
[221:28.24]What are you doing on top?
[221:30.42]Not my dogs in here yelling at me.
[221:31.59]We're gonna be in sixth.
[221:33.57]Yep.
[221:35.31]We are forever cursed to be in sixth place every time.
[221:39.49]Doesn't matter if there's 16 people, 20 people, 100 people.
[221:42.29]We're always going to be sixth.
[221:48.07]door.
[221:48.87]Whatever the hell it was.
[221:54.66]Why am I always in sixth?
[222:00.70]It shouldn't be this way.
[222:02.20]I'm not in sixth.
[222:07.60]Aha.
[222:08.06]He made it into sixth.
[222:12.22]Look what he did.
[222:12.80]He let a guy pass him and he got in sixth place.
[222:15.52]Ha ha ha ha.
[222:19.45]Dude, highlight that.
[222:20.55]See?
[222:20.63]It's not easy.
[222:21.09]That guy just fucked it up.
[222:50.31]Did not finish.
[222:56.61]Oh, this stream just got funny.
[222:59.09]Hey, Sab.
[223:03.51]Sab3600, thank you for four months.
[223:07.09]Much appreciated.
[223:10.13]Thanks for sticking around for four months.
[223:13.47]Sweet.
[223:15.49]Alright, see, I'm... Okay, the glass is like right here.
[223:19.68]So here's your cup of milk or something, right?
[223:23.50]You never would have a glass of milk this high.
[223:26.66]It sucks to be here.
[223:28.74]You'd be topped off and you'd be bumping around and dipping around the sides.
[223:31.82]You'd be getting juice all over the edges.
[223:34.44]No, a good glass of milk, I would put it right here.
[223:39.16]Four, five, six.
[223:40.76]That's just enough to enjoy a glass of milk.
[223:43.84]I'm your dad.
[223:46.28]Destroy him!
[223:51.20]Completely original meme.
[223:54.12]Welcome.
[223:56.18]Thanks for your subscription.
[223:58.84]You got a completely original meme name?
[224:03.68]Thank you, though.
[224:04.40]Welcome.
[224:05.88]Much love.
[224:09.64]One more.
[224:09.96]This is the last one.
[224:14.22]One more.
[224:14.48]What are you doing, dog?
[224:20.10]Come here.
[224:21.14]What are you doing?
[224:21.89]Come here.
[224:25.11]Thanks, Dad.
[224:25.67]Oh, damn.
[224:33.10]This one got started quick.
[224:36.24]This is definitely going to be the last one.
[224:37.70]Because I think this is the only one I haven't done.
[224:44.21]The good thing is we get to be clown cars.
[224:49.58]Alright fam, I'm gonna go watch Orange is the New Meme.
[224:55.44]Stayed up till 7.28 AM watching you.
[224:57.92]Love me.
[224:59.97]Damn, that's late.
[225:01.17]Or early, depending on where you are.
[225:03.69]Or how you look at it.
[225:04.35]You know, if you're a glass half full kind of guy, that's you stayed up late.
[225:08.09]If you're a glass half empty kind of guy, you stayed up early.
[225:12.85]It's way too early.
[225:17.82]No, that's not right.
[225:18.94]Something like that.
[225:19.48]Somebody with a fucking better brain will come up with a better idea.
[225:26.40]Definitely gonna do the fucking clown car, though.
[225:38.90]7.30 AM is right in the middle.
[225:43.71]I guess, I mean, it wouldn't, no, it would be 12.
[225:45.91]It would be noon, wouldn't it?
[225:47.03]Wouldn't noon be like, or midnight be the middle?
[225:51.32]It's like 12 hours, 12 hours, right?
[225:53.46]So it would be, what's 1,200 hours?
[225:57.82]That's just right in the center.
[226:06.11]I didn't confirm the bet.
[226:16.82]I wish I had that clown car horn.
[226:19.66]I have a default shit car horn.
[226:23.22]But I do have the best McDonald's car out of the bunch, I would say.
[226:28.62]Wait, is this first person only?
[226:31.92]This is fucking first person only!
[226:33.68]What?
[226:39.16]Who did this?
[226:44.66]This is bullshit.
[226:50.38]Yeah, I got a happy meal toy, that's right.
[227:00.76]Nobody can do this.
[227:05.68]What?
[227:06.74]How did I fall out of the fucking... How did I fall out?
[227:15.23]No, it's gonna be me.
[227:17.33]It's gonna be me that blows up.
[227:19.95]No, not if I pass this guy!
[227:24.19]Fuck the world!
[227:44.05]God damn it.
[227:50.12]Who's blowing up?
[227:51.10]Alright, this guy's gonna explode.
[227:54.88]Come on, you can do it!
[228:03.15]Okay, I was gonna get to the guy in the last place.
[228:06.87]Yeah, we gotta get to the guy in the last place every time.
[228:09.33]It's way better that way.
[228:12.53]Come on.
[228:14.05]Come on, get to the guy in the last...
[228:19.00]Let's see what his last-ditch desperation effort is.
[228:23.56]Wait, that's not him.
[228:24.24]Where is he?
[228:28.42]Why can't I go past five or six?
[228:31.28]That's dumb.
[228:40.16]I want to go back.
[228:45.36]Oh, hey, Star.
[228:46.62]What's up, dude?
[228:50.15]This person's in second.
[228:51.19]They'll go to the next driver.
[228:53.19]It just put me from fucking the guy in sixth to seventh.
[228:56.03]And then to second place.
[228:58.93]I want to see the guy at the desperate end.
[229:00.45]I gotta go forward and then forward.
[229:18.11]It takes a million years to load.
[229:20.59]Come on, Rockstar.
[229:22.23]Come on.
[229:25.65]Shouldn't... Here we go.
[229:26.87]No, okay.
[229:27.99]No, this isn't even the right guy.
[229:28.99]I have no idea.
[229:31.33]Well, we're just going to stay on this guy.
[229:32.85]Hopefully he shows us something interesting.
[229:38.15]Show us the fucking money, dude.
[229:42.47]Everyone's counting on you.
[229:51.43]Uh-oh, and here comes an explosion!
[229:53.45]There he is, that guy.
[230:05.03]Yeah, this is not who's in what place they're in.
[230:08.00]Otherwise, this is this guy right here, and he's in fifth.
[230:11.88]Which means he's this guy, but that's not that guy.
[230:19.98]This guy's in third.
[230:20.82]This guy's in fourth.
[230:29.17]Uh-oh, what's he doing?
[230:29.91]Alright, now it is this guy.
[230:35.15]This guy's gonna explode.
[230:39.54]We gotta see a spectacle.
[230:40.44]One of these two guys is gonna blow up.
[230:45.57]Oh, boy.
[230:46.43]He blew it.
[230:48.03]He blew it.
[230:49.99]Oh, come on.
[230:50.59]Don't blow it.
[230:51.19]You're going to have to have a crazy last-ditch thing where you do something cool.
[230:57.72]He didn't blow up.
[231:01.24]What?
[231:02.46]I'm confused.
[231:04.33]I'm very confused at how the hell that whole thing just worked.
[231:12.47]All right.
[231:14.40]That's... That's the end.
[231:23.72]Sounds like a wolf.
[231:26.27]But before I go, I have to at least, like, attack, like, three people on a street.
[231:31.33]It's important.
[231:33.75]Good sixth place, boy.
[231:35.41]Oh, jeez.
[231:44.39]Tinder update before you say bye.
[231:47.07]Well, the last message that was received, it is, oh, it's 1.30 in the morning.
[231:54.55]So, we'll see if we keep the conversation going tomorrow.
[232:09.63]Oh, you?
[232:11.97]How you doing?
[232:12.41]Good, you?
[232:12.75]How are you?
[232:19.58]I'm surprised you guys remembered.
[232:21.18]Huh.
[232:23.42]Huh.
[232:28.98]Yeah, already done all these.
[232:31.15]We're getting out.
[232:37.85]Did you get her number?
[232:39.47]Uh, no.
[232:40.59]But that's because I sent the message at like 1 in the morning.
[232:43.96]So I'm going to assume that it's just too late.
[232:51.48]She probably went to bed.
[232:55.41]Maybe she was just like, fuck this guy!
[232:57.63]Boink!
[232:58.65]And took off.
[233:00.09]Who knows?
[233:02.49]I'll find another.
[233:09.72]Dumped.
[233:15.92]Tinder.
[233:16.36]No, what are we talking about?
[233:18.90]Did she open the message?
[233:20.38]I don't know.
[233:20.82]She started the conversation.
[233:22.18]There you go.
[233:22.56]How's that?
[233:24.14]I didn't start it.
[233:24.79]She started it.
[233:25.61]She said, hey, what's up?
[233:27.67]But she made the first contact, guys.
[233:30.49]Sorry to say.
[233:43.47]Blipping time once again.
[233:50.42]Oh, damn.
[233:51.60]She started the talk?
[233:54.00]Oh, so it's Catfish.
[234:01.99]You guys are fucking dicks.
[234:05.69]Yeah, the last thing she said was, like, LOL, maybe we can meet up.
[234:11.87]Give me your phone number and, like, I'm gonna book us a hotel.
[234:14.49]Can I get your credit card?
[234:16.34]And I was like, yeah, fucking sick.
[234:17.78]That sounds good.
[234:18.34]I'll pay for it.
[234:23.95]I was like, yeah, whatever.
[234:24.61]I mean, they're kind of weird, but... What?
[234:33.22]That made no noise.
[234:36.86]It's you?
[234:40.98]I keep getting texts.
[234:42.06]I'm in, like, the real world now.
[234:45.02]I'm not in the video game world.
[234:46.18]I'm in the real world.
[234:55.89]Give her your social.
[234:58.09]Why are there no sounds?
[235:01.33]What's going on?
[235:07.15]I'm confused here.
[235:09.35]What happened to the game's audio?
[235:12.83]All I can hear is some wind and my phone texts.
[235:24.03]Money pick up.
[235:27.18]Make sure you don't forget that money sound.
[235:38.53]What the fuck is this?
[235:39.65]It's like... It's making like... This is really weird.
[236:00.55]It's almost hard to concentrate on what's happening around me.
[236:03.83]The audio left to meet my date.
[236:05.97]His shotgun's making noise.
[236:08.22]Alright.
[236:15.82]Underwater?
[236:16.46]Yeah.
[236:17.04]Felt like I was underwater.
[236:19.68]Alright.
[236:20.02]We're going to end this by doing a haymaker to somebody that's outside the hospital.
[236:26.36]Still no audio.
[236:28.94]Hmm.
[236:30.26]Will.
[236:33.94]I'm just gonna stab somebody that's just hanging out.
[236:38.10]Not you.
[236:38.60]Not you.
[236:39.08]I'll just tackle you.
[236:41.54]Wow.
[236:42.84]I just got denied.
[236:43.94]She just shut me the fuck down.
[236:52.07]Got that guy.
[236:59.19]Hey, fellas.
[237:06.51]Okay, these two guys were already dead.
[237:10.17]Both those guys were both dead already before I got here.
[237:13.67]I just happened to move them.
[237:21.49]Oh, Jesus!
[237:23.35]Without audio, this is like fucking worse.
[237:25.45]This is actually worse without audio.
[237:32.05]I feel like I'm watching a silent film.
[237:33.69]It's like fucking creeping me out.
[237:45.07]Why are these people not freaking out?
[237:46.33]This one guy decided that his coffee was more... I didn't even know the cop was behind me.
[238:00.28]That guy's like, I've seen worse.
[238:01.94]I'm fucking staying here and enjoying this.
[238:09.44]Alright, that's it.
[238:12.38]I'm gonna be going to bed.
[238:15.10]Thanks everybody for watching.
[238:17.94]Take care.
[238:18.32]Hope you enjoyed it.
[238:20.47]If you didn't, then I'm sorry.
[238:21.97]I'll do better next time.
[238:24.43]That was the same guy.
[238:27.88]Wait, what?
[238:29.46]That's right.
[238:30.38]I killed your boyfriend by jumping on him from a trash can.
[238:38.03]I'm gonna have to kill this guy by jumping on him from a mailbox.
[238:41.37]Hey, ze shpee.
[238:43.55]Thank you for four months, dude.
[238:45.37]Welcome back.
[238:46.41]The chat was going fast, so I didn't really see what you said.
[238:48.85]What are you looking at?
[238:57.18]Something funny?
[239:00.24]I punched her through the glass.
[239:04.54]I missed her.
[239:05.20]She died from the ear explosion.
[239:11.58]Where am I going?
[239:12.06]Who am I punching?
[239:17.78]Get elbowed, you fucking dead.
[239:25.37]Will I be streaming tomorrow?
[239:26.35]I don't know.
[239:29.19]Maybe.
[239:30.15]I haven't figured that out yet.
[239:40.29]See, I can't even hear the police.
[239:41.61]I don't even know they're coming.
[239:53.31]All you can hear is like, bing, bang, bing, bing.
[239:57.08]Oh, fuck, what's happening?
[240:00.60]Oh, no!
[240:01.56]No!
[240:02.56]No!
[240:04.08]No!
[240:05.16]No, I didn't want to do that.
[240:06.00]I was trying to punch the guy.
[240:07.76]I'm so sorry.
[240:10.03]I didn't mean to.
[240:11.63]I'm gonna take it out on this guy.
[240:12.79]Get me out of here.
[240:29.36]Worse than Ramsay.
[240:36.30]What is wrong with you?
[240:37.28]I didn't mean to.
[240:39.04]You saw me.
[240:39.56]I was trying to punch the people in the front.
[240:41.46]Trying to punch the guy.
[240:42.84]I didn't do it.
[240:45.39]I didn't mean to do it.
[240:46.37]It wasn't me.
[240:47.37]I'm not Joffrey.
[240:51.01]Alright.
[240:51.71]Good night, guys.
[240:53.77]Thank you so much for watching.
[240:55.93]I will see you guys when I see you.
[240:58.24]If not tomorrow, then probably the next day.
[241:00.88]Or maybe, I don't know.
[241:04.80]I gotta punch one more person in the face.
[241:06.24]So, goodnight, guys.
[241:13.86]Good luck.
[241:14.44]Thanks to all the new viewers, all the new subs, all the old subs, all the people that have been watching.
[241:17.53]Thank you.
[241:17.89]Goodbye, goodbye, goodnight.
[241:18.89]And this is where we're gonna end it.
[241:25.45]No, not you.
[241:27.59]Not you.
[241:32.38]No, not you either.
[241:35.60]You can't escape your sins, dog killer.
[241:37.84]Oh, jeez.
[241:39.36]No, not you.
[241:40.18]You're too easy.
[241:42.00]You're too easy.
[241:42.68]You're just, like, walking down the street.
[241:46.24]There's got to be somebody that's, like, already in an argument.
[241:50.01]I will push you, though.
[241:54.87]No, all these, like, people walking.
[241:56.65]Where are the people having the conversations?
[242:02.93]Like somebody talking on a phone or somebody that's like hard to find.
