[00:01.95]hi guys how are you doing this fine day I'm doing pretty good I ate a little bit of cool whip so that's always a good day that's a good start to a day forget about eggs forget about bacon forget about all your favorite breakfast stuff a spoonful of frozen cool whip dash of honey and uh and a cigarette no I'm kidding don't do that don't smoke
[00:34.74]Cigarette-shaped Cool Whip.
[00:41.89]Soylent.
[00:45.02]No.
[00:48.54]Did another just drink milk?
[00:53.15]Let me see the cigarettes in the chat, please.
[00:55.91]Yeah, I'm going to play Dark Souls.
[00:57.91]Dark Souls Remastered.
[01:00.02]Let's wait for people to trickle in so we can talk about Dark Souls and my journey with Dark Souls and where that journey will take us.
[01:10.76]I'll be right back.
[01:12.52]See you in a minute.
[01:37.50]No, it's not supposed to be a cigarette.
[01:38.94]That's a finger gun that looks like a J, a GX.
[01:43.14]But, you know, you could use it as a cigarette.
[01:45.26]You could use it as anything you want.
[01:49.06]The creativity is all on your side of the table.
[01:53.60]And I am relaxed today.
[01:56.30]Can we just be clear about that?
[01:58.88]I got some fresh air.
[02:02.22]I took a walk.
[02:04.22]Had some ice cream.
[02:06.76]I'm so smooth right now.
[02:09.12]I'm ready to play Dark Souls and immediately dial up to 11 and fucking rip my hair out.
[02:13.74]You know what I mean?
[02:17.91]What a great day.
[02:18.93]I'm loving this.
[02:22.23]Dark Souls Remastered.
[02:22.99]I'm going to start it.
[02:25.81]I'm going to try to get through it.
[02:31.01]I've done Demon's Souls on stream.
[02:32.46]I did Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[02:35.83]Why not give the original that everybody loves so much that I've never beaten, that I've never even gotten halfway through?
[02:43.89]Seems like a good time to try.
[02:49.14]All in one stream.
[02:49.94]That's not going to happen.
[02:53.68]But let's... I'm pretty much ready to go.
[02:56.64]Let me just go like this.
[03:00.36]And there it is.
[03:05.08]Alright, let's move this down.
[03:08.02]Didn't really get a chance to test the audio levels, but that's fine.
[03:12.87]We can fix it when we need to.
[03:16.47]And there we are.
[03:18.77]So the last two games in the Souls franchise, I played Dex characters.
[03:27.18]So we're not going to do Dex-Jex.
[03:28.86]We're not doing Jex-Jex.
[03:32.37]I think I want to do big, giant, ultra-great sword.
[03:35.13]I want to be huge guy.
[03:36.13]I want to be big, long sword, heavy weapon guy.
[03:41.28]I might restart.
[03:41.86]I don't know.
[03:42.92]This process, this is... I, like, love these games.
[03:48.90]And I have a lot of fun in them.
[03:49.96]I do get a little... I fly off the cuff a little bit here.
[03:53.03]Off the handle.
[03:54.91]But I want to experience this game.
[03:57.81]So...
[03:59.52]There ain't gonna be, like, sub-only mode.
[04:01.18]We did that for Dark Souls 3, but this game's been out for a long time.
[04:04.54]I don't... Don't... Don't make me put on sub... Just don't make me put on sub-only mode, okay?
[04:09.48]I've never played through this game before.
[04:10.99]I might miss some stuff.
[04:13.87]I don't know all the secrets.
[04:14.99]I don't know all, like, the special routes.
[04:17.17]So... Just, like, lay the Rapunzel hair down a few more inches for me so I can grab it, you know what I mean?
[04:26.24]So we're going to do strength and probably... We're going to do strength, faith, intelligence, and resistance.
[04:31.77]I'm going to try to get them all to 50 points.
[04:33.81]That's a lie.
[04:34.93]Name the character.
[04:39.29]Character name.
[04:40.23]This is really important.
[04:42.87]Large guy with a big sword.
[04:49.86]Lancelot.
[04:51.66]And he's going to have a lance.
[04:53.40]No, fuck that.
[04:53.82]We're doing a lance character.
[04:55.60]Lance a lot.
[05:00.63]I like it.
[05:01.69]I kind of need to have him be lance a lot.
[05:14.60]There are no lances?
[05:15.44]There aren't?
[05:16.58]No, that's too bad.
[05:20.59]Dual lances?
[05:23.97]It's awful.
[05:24.51]Alright, how about not lance a lot?
[05:29.69]Jax a lot.
[05:30.31]No, no Jax.
[05:32.52]We can't use Jax in every single video game.
[05:37.44]How about... A dancing myriad of symphonic blades.
[05:47.90]You can't do that.
[05:51.69]This is the most important thing in the whole game.
[05:53.47]The character creator.
[05:54.21]How about... Yonder.
[06:03.04]Or... Yonder a lot.
[06:10.30]I've earned a source of jacks.
[06:11.32]No, I got it.
[06:11.94]I got it.
[06:12.44]I got it.
[06:26.94]Linguistic?
[06:29.84]Linguini?
[06:31.38]He's gonna have a long sword, right?
[06:33.56]What's the big long tube pasta?
[06:39.16]What's that called?
[06:39.68]Is it rigatoni?
[06:45.70]Long names, haha.
[06:56.51]Alright, just get a name!
[06:58.73]I'm getting into World of Warcraft mode.
[07:00.97]I'm gonna sit here for an hour.
[07:10.10]It's long and it's silver.
[07:12.34]The sword is silver.
[07:16.44]Yeah, because the sword is long.
[07:21.92]Hard, like, it's a long... Alright, well, we're gonna go with... That's what it is.
[07:31.25]I'm just describing what it is.
[07:32.35]It's gonna be Silverpenic.
[07:40.61]Whatever.
[07:41.31]It doesn't matter.
[07:42.05]No one's even gonna see this name.
[07:47.33]All the people in the VOD had just skipped this part, so it doesn't matter.
[07:54.70]Penne is small pasta.
[07:57.10]It doesn't matter.
[07:57.94]There you go, there's the pun.
[07:59.18]Alright, we're going to go bandit.
[08:01.34]That's the correct thing, because I want to start off, I want to be heavy, strong penne.
[08:10.07]I wish I could skip this in real time.
[08:12.57]Well, you can't.
[08:13.62]You can't.
[08:14.20]You have to watch this whole thing from start to finish.
[08:18.80]Bandit's vitality, a lot of strength, endurance.
[08:21.70]That's what I'm going to go with.
[08:24.52]The gift?
[08:26.27]Um... I don't... What's the starting thing to pick in this game?
[08:31.81]Maybe, like, the Twin Humanities or... The Fire Bombs are really good.
[08:36.61]The Fire Bombs can take out that first Asylum Demon in, like, five seconds, right?
[08:42.39]Pendant doesn't do anything.
[08:46.47]You're not going to debate me here.
[08:48.21]I'm sorry, guys.
[08:51.93]I heard the key is good, but I don't know what door that really opens.
[08:54.79]I guess it's alright to have.
[08:57.81]The key is for babies.
[09:00.39]So I'm going to get made fun of on all the web forums if I pick up the key.
[09:07.59]This is my first real run of the game.
[09:09.17]We're gonna do Baby Key, okay?
[09:11.61]Physique, I want it to be tiny head and huge.
[09:16.70]Very large.
[09:17.32]No, it's gotta be... I want it to be big and quick like the Hulk.
[09:23.10]Yeah, like that.
[09:27.65]No, no.
[09:28.09]Now we gotta have... We gotta do this whole thing.
[09:29.95]We're gonna make this quick.
[09:38.26]Alright, I have to make a character as close to the main character of Final Fantasy XV as I can.
[09:42.80]Okay?
[09:43.62]That's the goal.
[09:48.41]Where's white?
[09:49.89]There it is.
[09:53.19]Wait, hold on.
[09:54.49]No, customize.
[09:55.11]There it is.
[09:55.47]Okay.
[09:59.23]There we go.
[09:59.69]So let's get...
[10:08.79]Okay, but it's changing him making when he's all he turns into a ghost How about young let's make him really young Alright young just turns him into the magneto actor what does that guy's name?
[10:23.70]No, let's let's stay strong here Hey remember Final Fantasy Okay, that's fine
[10:41.51]He looks really bad.
[10:43.17]What a forehead.
[10:44.99]Bra width.
[10:46.93]He just looks like a caveman.
[10:50.30]Just make him Magneto.
[10:54.86]Is there items in the game that can make him look like Magneto?
[11:02.90]He's getting there.
[11:03.48]Oh, God.
[11:08.39]This is a pretty edgy Final Fantasy kind of character, don't you think?
[11:10.98]He's got a permanent brow frown.
[11:12.46]I think that's fine.
[11:18.78]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
[11:19.82]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:20.86]Excuse me.
[11:21.34]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:22.38]Go back.
[11:23.90]We're making the bird for the Muppets.
[11:26.92]I don't even care.
[11:31.75]Go back.
[11:39.66]You guys know exactly who I'm talking about.
[11:41.08]That blue angry bird.
[11:42.80]Alright, forehead.
[11:49.76]Very wide.
[11:50.36]Is it like hair on the sides of the face?
[11:56.49]It's like this.
[12:01.87]Play angry birds.
[12:03.23]If he's gonna be blue, it's gonna be perfect.
[12:08.08]Okay, eyes.
[12:08.54]Here we go.
[12:09.54]Eye position.
[12:10.42]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[12:11.10]Eyes.
[12:11.46]There we go.
[12:14.72]No, his eyes are up.
[12:15.72]They're up higher.
[12:17.84]Yeah, the Patriot.
[12:18.60]That blue bird.
[12:19.50]The one that talks like this.
[12:23.12]No.
[12:24.28]I will not think it is fun.
[12:25.95]He's the one that hates everything.
[12:35.68]Okay, what color are his eyes?
[12:37.40]He's like... Eagle.
[12:39.30]Okay, what about eye area?
[12:44.88]Eye socket color.
[12:46.34]Light it up.
[12:48.50]Pale.
[12:48.86]They're all weirdos.
[12:51.69]What do you mean?
[12:54.03]It's a work in progress.
[12:54.81]Don't worry.
[12:55.09]You'll see.
[12:56.73]Eyeshadow.
[12:57.89]Give him eyeshadow.
[12:59.71]I gotta get a picture of him.
[13:01.11]No, no, no.
[13:01.63]Hold on.
[13:06.03]I'm gonna find out his name first of all.
[13:07.27]It's important.
[13:08.87]Blue Muppet Eagle.
[13:10.95]He's got a name.
[13:14.62]Sam the Eagle.
[13:15.32]There he is.
[13:15.72]Okay.
[13:16.22]He's got a huge nose.
[13:18.18]Like a beak.
[13:19.82]He's got giant eyebrows.
[13:21.54]And he's got these weird ear hair handles.
[13:26.14]Alright, there we go.
[13:30.82]You know, I should probably put this on stream, right?
[13:33.21]That makes sense.
[13:37.75]Just to make sure you can help me out here with the design choices.
[13:40.75]Make sure I get it right.
[13:44.37]There it is.
[13:53.43]Okay, here we go.
[13:55.40]Well, that was scary.
[14:01.32]This guy.
[14:06.57]Alright, so I did this completely wrong.
[14:09.43]This is not even remotely correct.
[14:11.23]We have to go back to the eyes.
[14:12.19]He doesn't really have a forehead.
[14:15.86]Let's fix that.
[14:17.68]We'll do the nose, though.
[14:21.76]He's got a really long... It's like it's almost his whole face.
[14:26.58]No, it goes down.
[14:30.55]Nose tip should be low because it goes over his mouth.
[14:38.91]Okay.
[14:40.01]Nose placement low.
[14:42.87]Actually, the high is what I want.
[14:44.61]There we go.
[14:47.46]Slanted all the way down over his mouth.
[14:54.22]Alright.
[14:54.46]Nostrils.
[14:55.32]He doesn't really have any.
[14:59.68]That's a beak.
[15:00.46]That's not a nose.
[15:04.94]Yep.
[15:05.48]Alright.
[15:06.47]Make that wide, though, because it's essentially his whole face.
[15:13.85]Okay.
[15:15.35]So far, so good.
[15:18.41]Is that it?
[15:19.17]Nose ridge, nostrils.
[15:20.03]Yep, got him.
[15:21.45]Cheeks.
[15:21.75]He's got a square face.
[15:26.16]I gotta move those eyes all the way up on his forehead, though.
[15:30.00]These eyes are way too far apart.
[15:33.22]That's fine.
[15:33.92]Cheekbone high.
[15:40.67]Don't... It's gonna look pretty close.
[15:45.47]Yeah, there's a square face.
[15:48.99]Pull these in.
[15:52.78]Not fat.
[15:53.30]They're pretty thin.
[15:57.68]I would say right here.
[16:01.70]No, he doesn't really have nasolabial folds.
[16:06.58]Yeah, pretty light.
[16:08.84]Cheeks, that's it, right?
[16:09.62]Okay, mouth.
[16:10.88]Huge mouth.
[16:12.32]Absolutely gigantic.
[16:17.73]Let's just look at that for now.
[16:21.07]Open?
[16:21.45]No, his mouth is open.
[16:23.55]Mouth expression is sad.
[16:27.51]Should I do happy?
[16:28.15]No, he's never happy.
[16:34.32]Lip fullness.
[16:37.30]Okay.
[16:40.47]Comes in.
[16:43.55]I need like a big mouth.
[16:48.90]He just looks like Pluto.
[16:51.76]Not yet.
[16:52.16]Just wait until he's blue and we give him a little bit of hair.
[16:57.99]Here we go.
[16:58.53]Mouth.
[17:01.23]That comes in.
[17:05.13]He does have a mouth slant that goes like this.
[17:08.43]That looks pretty good.
[17:10.13]Should I do it the other way?
[17:13.83]No, it's definitely this other way.
[17:17.98]Mouth position down.
[17:21.82]Mouth width.
[17:22.48]Make it really wide.
[17:24.50]Mouth chin distance.
[17:29.22]No.
[17:30.16]I don't want to turn into a total freak here.
[17:32.83]That's fine right there.
[17:37.93]Right there.
[17:39.07]Yep.
[17:41.01]Lipstick.
[17:42.01]Well, it's got to be blue.
[17:46.49]That's not really doing anything.
[17:48.05]That's just giving him a red mouth.
[17:57.16]Lips.
[17:57.66]Lip shape.
[17:58.22]Yeah, we already got that.
[17:58.90]Alright.
[18:00.16]Now we need to do jaw, which is very straightforward.
[18:05.63]Doesn't come out that far.
[18:06.79]He doesn't really have much of a chin.
[18:11.57]Just tapers off.
[18:16.28]Chin protrusion.
[18:18.32]There we go.
[18:22.75]I do need to fill that out, though.
[18:24.05]Alright, he just looks like one of the... He looks like one of the creators from Prometheus.
[18:34.81]You know those angry, pale, translucent dudes?
[18:44.26]That's fine.
[18:49.05]No, no, no, no.
[18:49.73]That's sucking it in way too much.
[18:52.11]The engineers, yeah.
[18:57.32]I think that looks okay.
[18:57.86]Might have to pull that mouth in a little more.
[19:05.76]Lower jaw.
[19:06.48]It needs to be lower.
[19:09.70]There we go.
[19:10.08]Perfect.
[19:10.38]Perfect.
[19:18.31]Perfect.
[19:20.80]The eyes do need to be changed.
[19:23.06]Beard.
[19:24.20]Okay, this is... We need to be... We need to be fun here.
[19:28.52]We gotta be fun here.
[19:33.15]No, he doesn't have any facial hair.
[19:34.45]It's just blue.
[19:35.85]He has facial hair in his ears.
[19:38.23]Is that technically a face?
[19:41.43]Although, I could do this black.. Okay, I think I'm gonna do it black so it looks like it's his mouth.
[19:58.52]I can't do black?
[20:02.70]That's kind of annoying.
[20:04.10]Should be fine.
[20:04.58]The hair color, here we go.
[20:10.41]How do I get just black?
[20:19.75]Alright, his hair color.
[20:20.57]Why is his hair color just permanently red?
[20:22.67]Alright, it's the Sandy Eagle that drank like a bunch of Kool-Aid.
[20:29.07]Alright, we need to go back to this.
[20:30.03]Eyes.
[20:31.49]Okay, eyes.
[20:32.33]Eye position.
[20:34.95]Up.
[20:35.33]Eye size.
[20:36.09]Large.
[20:40.66]Spacing.
[20:41.34]Pull them in.
[20:46.92]So these need to be slanned.
[20:48.38]Let's go.
[20:48.88]I gotta go, like, there we go.
[20:50.58]Okay.
[20:53.98]No, that looks alright.
[21:00.16]It's a little too much though.
[21:01.28]That's like, that's too much.
[21:07.89]His forehead needs to come way down.
[21:15.55]That's fine.
[21:16.61]Alright, forehead.
[21:19.66]Pull it in.
[21:23.84]No, I need to keep the angry eyebrows.
[21:36.29]It's just like fucking bald guy eyebrow brow height pull it up His eyebrows are pretty flat
[22:02.34]Oh my god.
[22:03.42]Oh well.
[22:08.00]That's kind of better.
[22:08.96]These need to be bushy.
[22:11.16]Can I eventually get to that point?
[22:13.48]I brought density dense.
[22:17.94]Okay.
[22:19.50]These need to be high.
[22:23.44]Really thick.
[22:28.20]Really thick again.
[22:33.06]Lower brow.
[22:34.23]No, they all have to be down.
[22:41.29]Okay, brow ridge.
[22:42.43]That's... There we go.
[22:48.11]Alright, that's it.
[22:49.47]Let me just... Hold on.
[22:50.81]Nose, forehead, size.
[22:55.40]That's gotta go the other way.
[22:59.48]Face aspect ratio.
[23:02.04]I don't even know what that means.
[23:06.52]Wide, narrow, I'm trying to figure out this way I can pull his head up.
[23:09.18]Okay, here we go.
[23:16.26]Blue.
[23:23.47]This is, why is he red?
[23:27.03]No, make him blue!
[23:36.98]I need him to be blue.
[23:40.23]Purple.
[23:41.51]Is it about green?
[23:42.49]How do you make blue?
[23:44.75]There we go.
[23:48.18]Take away the red.
[23:48.96]No, that's just... I wanted to make him like an actual blue.
[24:06.50]This did not come out the way that I thought it was going to come out.
[24:10.76]There's a blue slider.
[24:11.69]Yeah, but watch what happens.
[24:15.37]He turns into, like, Glue Man.
[24:22.46]Alright, well, that's close enough.
[24:32.27]That's better.
[24:32.77]Okay.
[24:33.09]Balanced color tone.
[24:33.85]That's fine.
[24:35.45]Alright.
[24:38.85]Maturity.
[24:39.41]This is where we can... No!
[24:41.11]I just blew it.
[24:44.67]No, I didn't.
[24:45.08]It's okay.
[24:45.30]It's salvageable.
[24:55.36]No.
[24:55.68]That's not what this guy looks like.
[25:01.79]Alright, we're going back to the Final Fantasy character.
[25:04.53]Here he is.
[25:07.89]This is just like a toddler's drawing of Aquaman.
[25:15.76]Whatever.
[25:16.66]This is him.
[25:28.27]It's like a shitty Iceman.
[25:31.61]What?
[25:31.89]I'm done.
[25:32.71]I'm done.
[25:33.05]We gotta play the game now.
[25:36.63]I hate him.
[25:43.66]We spent 25 minutes on this.
[25:47.90]It's fine.
[25:48.42]He looks fine.
[25:51.14]Except, at least he's silver pinning.
[25:57.18]Alright, can we get the fucking eagle off?
[25:58.70]That was... That was not worth it, but whatever.
[26:02.72]I'm gonna pretend it was.
[26:06.36]Hey, it's time to play Dark Souls Remastered.
[26:09.26]What do you guys say?
[26:11.86]You ready?
[26:12.32]Alright, starting equipment.
[26:17.90]I got like an axe.
[26:19.10]It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[26:20.45]Let's go.
[26:22.49]Start the game with Silver Penne.
[26:26.81]Here comes the cutscene.
[26:29.71]In the age of ancients... I told you, it's Silver Surfer's shitty cousin.
[26:33.31]The world was unformed.
[26:36.45]Shrouded by fog.
[26:40.62]A land of grey crags, arch trees, and everlasting dragons.
[26:47.40]Don't do strength bandit.
[26:48.66]Why not?
[26:49.62]I want to have a huge sword.
[26:53.16]But then there was fire...
[26:56.94]And with fire came disparity.
[27:02.92]Skip?
[27:03.34]I've never seen it before.
[27:04.19]I have, like, maybe, like, four times.
[27:07.03]Life and death.
[27:10.95]And, of course, light and dark.
[27:16.53]Wait, Gwen's actually in?
[27:17.61]I have to actually fight Gwen?
[27:19.83]I know that.
[27:20.33]I've seen the speed rooms.
[27:22.53]Then, from the dark, they came.
[27:28.33]And found the souls of lords within the flame.
[27:32.23]Can't you kill Gwyn in one swing or something?
[27:41.52]Nito, the first of the dead.
[27:44.46]This is the guy that made the humanity, right?
[27:47.28]No, the lost one.
[27:49.74]Where is he?
[27:51.36]Like the stranger, whatever her name is.
[27:54.43]And her daughters of chaos.
[27:58.52]Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights.
[28:04.14]Come on, Gwyn!
[28:07.70]And the Faultive Pygmy.
[28:09.60]The Pygmy, that's the guy that ruined everything.
[28:12.02]That's the golem that made humans and shit, right?
[28:19.24]With the strength of lords, they challenged the dragons.
[28:28.24]Was it worth 25 minutes making that joke?
[28:30.92]What do you think?
[28:32.88]Pretty easy answer.
[28:34.20]The witches weaved great firestorms.
[28:43.47]Leto unleashed a miasma of death and disease.
[28:48.25]He's cool looking.
[28:51.19]And Seath the Scales betrayed his own, and the dragons were
[29:01.99]Oh yeah, that's the toothpaste dragon, right?
[29:07.50]Because he looks like the triple crest toothpaste squeeze.
[29:14.28]He's like blue, red, white.
[29:16.14]He looks like a tube of toothpaste squeeze.
[29:20.65]But soon the flames will fade and only dark will remain.
[29:34.55]Aquafresh yeah, whatever My character looks like that Hey, we found the joke for Dark Souls 1
[29:58.87]Toothpaste references.
[30:00.44]Get ready to hear that like 67 more times throughout the next 12 days.
[30:11.30]Okay.
[30:13.24]Here we go.
[30:13.58]Remastered.
[30:14.14]Let's see how much more high definition it is.
[30:19.39]Fire is better.
[30:21.29]The glow is better.
[30:21.93]It's got a better sheen.
[30:27.31]The color smear is better.
[30:33.61]The high graft looks good.
[30:35.73]The foliage meter is pretty great too.
[30:38.67]They put that slider up at least one or two notches.
[30:59.85]And there I am.
[31:06.05]Come on, Doug, let's go to the Honker Burger.
[31:09.98]Skeeter!
[31:10.48]What's that guy's name, Skeeter?
[31:13.72]Every time he came on screen, it was like... Whoa!
[31:35.51]Like a toothpick joke.
[31:36.57]A toothpaste joke.
[31:38.93]I don't like the default bandit garb.
[31:44.17]It looks like a... I look like a sewer treatment plant worker.
[31:49.10]Alright, dungeon cell key.
[31:50.38]Let's just get our controls down.
[31:52.52]Still got it!
[31:55.26]Alright.
[31:55.88]This is supposed to be just a calm.
[31:58.52]We're just going to play Dark Souls.
[31:59.66]I just need to relax.
[32:01.10]I'm too fucking hyped up for this.
[32:06.61]I already know the controls.
[32:07.39]You don't have to tell me shit.
[32:08.29]Can I open this door?
[32:08.89]Nope.
[32:13.70]With a broken ass sword.
[32:18.34]I need to get every single bit of everything.
[32:23.71]I'm not going to run out of any juice.
[32:25.13]I want to suck up as many souls as I can.
[32:26.77]That's what I'm supposed to do.
[32:33.38]Am I fat rolling right now with this character?
[32:35.30]I'm not sure.
[32:40.99]We're going to take our time.
[32:42.13]I know that a lot of people have seen this before.
[32:45.45]But I've really only seen it like once.
[32:47.46]Up until maybe like three to five hours into the game.
[32:50.56]I want to take my time.
[32:56.89]I'm going to miss a bunch of your favorite shit.
[32:58.64]I know I am.
[32:59.96]So be ready to say, dude, stupid idiot, why are you not doing that?
[33:05.22]I'm ready for it.
[33:07.16]But just please be kind and rewind.
[33:12.80]There's the bonfire.
[33:14.02]Yeah.
[33:17.90]Killing the hollows in the beginning of the game.
[33:21.68]Yeah, I'm just getting ready.
[33:22.76]I'm just practicing.
[33:32.68]I missed the best weapon already.
[33:34.14]Oh, well.
[33:36.08]This is why I wanted the fire bombs, because I know the guy lands, I already know what happens, and it goes... Ready?
[33:48.80]Not yet.
[33:49.12]It happens in a minute.
[33:59.96]Come on, what are you gonna do?
[34:03.92]Oh, still got it!
[34:04.62]Gonna get a shield here.
[34:06.72]Anything in this room?
[34:07.54]Yeah, it's guard.
[34:09.56]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:10.06]Everybody knows that.
[34:10.86]Everybody's played this game before.
[34:18.94]Pick up my battle axe.
[34:20.66]Let's put it on.
[34:21.32]Should I even put the shield on?
[34:26.17]I feel like...
[34:29.04]What's a swing?
[34:29.58]Yeah, it swings like this.
[34:35.74]It's got some good swing to it.
[34:37.08]It's got some good weight to it.
[34:44.23]64 damage on the hollow.
[34:45.09]Yeah, I'm killing the hollows in the beginning.
[34:46.47]You're going to have to deal with it.
[34:48.19]You know what I mean?
[34:52.31]Let's see if I still got it with parries.
[34:55.57]Alright, let's see.
[34:56.07]Anything over here?
[34:58.28]Now you get the Estus Flask from the guy that's lying on the ground.
[35:00.94]Oh, still got it.
[35:07.68]Nope.
[35:13.58]Invisible walls.
[35:16.06]What, did I go through?
[35:16.80]Yeah, I'm sure I'm rolling.
[35:21.94]Yeah.
[35:22.88]I really probably should take the shield off, right?
[35:26.82]That's probably smart.
[35:28.50]There you go.
[35:28.90]This way.
[35:29.82]I have seen this part.
[35:31.22]I know what happens.
[35:32.87]I know.
[35:33.19]Here it comes.
[35:33.71]Watch out.
[35:34.23]Whoa, here comes the bowling ball.
[35:37.43]See?
[35:37.75]And, like, you get hit by it every time.
[35:39.23]There's no way to dodge.
[35:39.89]It's impossible to dodge.
[35:42.97]Oh.
[35:43.95]Well.
[35:46.15]No, not that same guy.
[35:46.83]Thank goodness.
[35:51.24]I'm sure you've seen everybody smash X at this part, but I want to experience the remaster.
[35:56.72]It's easy to dodge.
[35:59.82]I know, I'm just being an idiot.
[36:04.85]He gives you the Estus.
[36:05.63]Bowling pin cosplay.
[36:06.91]Yeah, we've already seen it.
[36:18.00]Alright, we've already seen it.
[36:19.61]You know how it works.
[36:20.77]We've already seen this movie.
[36:23.19]You press square to drink the Estus.
[36:26.69]Can I do anything down here?
[36:29.85]Yeah, this is the short... He's got the shortcut.
[36:32.85]Nice, okay.
[36:35.05]Let's go ahead and rest.
[36:45.90]I don't need to do that.
[36:48.97]That is so unnecessary.
[36:51.69]Hey, how are ya?
[36:55.66]I'll get it, I'll get it.
[36:57.42]It's been a while, I gotta, hold on.
[37:00.90]It's been a while.
[37:01.46]I gotta get back into it, get back into the swing of things here.
[37:09.93]I haven't played Dark Souls since Dark Souls 3, like two years ago.
[37:13.01]So come on, it's been a while.
[37:21.77]There's like a guy here, from what I remember.
[37:23.49]Come on out.
[37:26.73]No, fuck it, just kill him.
[37:27.67]What am I doing this for?
[37:35.48]I know you gotta parry the guy that's over here.
[37:37.12]I'm getting hit by everything.
[37:44.93]Come here.
[37:49.33]Fuck me.
[37:51.19]Don't die in the tutorial area.
[37:53.21]I played this last night and I didn't get hit one time.
[37:58.25]God.
[37:59.05]What kind of performance anxiety do I have?
[38:00.94]Am I having trouble peeing in the bathroom?
[38:04.50]I really am.
[38:04.96]I'm gonna die.
[38:09.52]I can't pee in front of you guys.
[38:10.72]I'm serious.
[38:12.80]I literally cannot go to the bathroom in front of you guys.
[38:18.00]I'm certain of it.
[38:30.53]This is locked.
[38:37.07]Let's go.
[38:42.64]Yeah, this is when you jump down here and... Hey, how are ya?
[38:49.15]Should've got the key.
[38:58.29]Two hits.
[38:58.69]Nope.
[39:02.66]Should I cut his tail off?
[39:03.54]Because everyone's going to scream that, right?
[39:08.56]Ooh, that hit me.
[39:14.88]I didn't cut his tail off.
[39:15.76]I'm the worst.
[39:19.74]The how are you joke?
[39:24.42]I gotta use the saucer.
[39:25.38]What's down here?
[39:26.62]Some stuff?
[39:27.42]Oh, this is the... He's very easy.
[39:32.13]He's very basic.
[39:35.01]I gotta, like, shake off the cobwebs before I... Again, like I said, have trouble pissing in front of everybody.
[39:41.33]By the time this stream is over, I want to have no issues at all going to the bathroom in front of everyone here.
[39:53.96]Yeah, I did this.
[40:02.41]When am I going to play Detroit Become Human?
[40:04.69]I already did.
[40:13.86]How far have I gotten in Dark Souls before?
[40:17.08]After Blighttown.
[40:17.90]And then I kind of stopped playing.
[40:26.51]It is a pretty good Spider-Man shield.
[40:34.24]Did you know that I can save 50% on Geico?
[40:43.47]No, it's not.
[40:43.81]That's way less.
[40:46.25]It's as advertised 15, but it depends on your area.
[40:48.81]It could be lower.
[40:57.25]I'm lying for the stream if I say I like this game.
[40:59.45]Why would I be lying?
[41:09.07]15% or more?
[41:09.51]No, it's 15% or less.
[41:14.91]Level up for the bonfire.
[41:16.03]Here's this guy.
[41:16.67]Wow, what do we have here?
[41:21.00]How'd the podcast go?
[41:22.02]Very well.
[41:22.42]It was a lot of fun.
[41:23.07]Kill.
[41:23.25]Kill this guy.
[41:25.57]The critical podcast.
[41:27.11]Charlie's podcast.
[41:30.51]Official podcast.
[41:49.07]Is he just describing where I got to last in the game?
[41:51.71]The cursed land of the undead.
[41:57.69]I'm going to talk to him a few times so they spill the beans on where to go.
[42:03.36]Actually kill him.
[42:05.26]No, I'm not going to... I'm not doing that.
[42:07.50]Not right now.
[42:08.20]Let's get some points in this drink.
[42:12.39]Alright.
[42:14.49]I need this... This is kind of loud in my ear.
[42:17.82]That also gives me problems.
[42:20.36]Why is it so loud for me?
[42:26.64]That's a decent volume, I think.
[42:27.68]Alright, let's get some level ups.
[42:30.03]Alright, I want strength.
[42:33.73]Vitality.
[42:35.15]We're going to go 16 strength, 13 vitality right off the bat.
[42:40.37]Because I want to do more damage, as much damage as I can with a big swinger.
[42:46.34]Now it's quiet.
[42:50.70]Try one more time.
[42:51.26]The game is really quiet compared to your voice.
[42:53.35]God damn it.
[42:54.43]This is the worst thing because I... I'm going to give you guys the... I'm going to give you guys some stuff about me.
[43:03.20]If a game is louder than my voice, I cannot talk on stream.
[43:08.94]I feel like I have a lawnmower going.
[43:11.10]It's like, yeah, so I'm standing outside of a jet engine.
[43:16.41]It's hard for me to talk when my voice is quieter than the game in my ears.
[43:23.21]Let me see if I can do something here.
[43:30.32]Lose the shield?
[43:30.92]Yeah, I will.
[43:33.68]Okay, how does this sound?
[43:35.51]What if I do this?
[43:39.63]Let me try this real quick.
[43:44.03]Hold on.
[43:46.61]Turn up your voice in game?
[43:50.56]My compressor is like a piece of shit.
[43:52.28]And for some reason, I cannot go higher than what it is right now.
[43:55.86]This is at maximum gain and maximum level.
[44:00.02]This thing sucks.
[44:03.45]That might be better.
[44:05.63]What do you think?
[44:06.03]Let's see.
[44:06.29]I'll give it a try.
[44:11.77]Is that okay?
[44:13.68]Can you handle this?
[44:24.62]That's good?
[44:25.01]Okay.
[44:26.01]That's good for me too.
[44:28.45]Alright, let's, uh... Let's go.
[44:32.23]I want 16 strength.
[44:33.25]I want to get a 15 vitality in, like... Let's do this for now.
[44:40.06]Confirm reinforcement.
[44:41.06]Yes.
[44:41.28]10... What, you... Hold on.
[44:44.74]You start with 10 Estus in this game?
[44:53.33]Turn on in... Turn up the in-game voice.
[44:55.31]Okay.
[45:00.97]You can hear characters better.
[45:01.81]Alright, let's go take a look around.
[45:04.09]Because I know that there is some shit around here.
[45:07.99]Let's explore.
[45:10.41]Six firebombs, good.
[45:15.34]Only at Firelink you get ten.
[45:17.80]That's incentive.
[45:22.10]That's incentive.
[45:24.38]I believe we are not acquainted.
[45:26.50]I am Petrus of Thorolund.
[45:28.82]Have you business with us?
[45:30.04]Do I need to turn it up a little more?
[45:31.54]I'd prefer to keep a distance, if possible.
[45:36.54]This guy... This guy's a Covenant, right?
[45:38.64]Should I join this Covenant right off the bat?
[45:43.04]No, he's a Covenant.
[45:44.76]Kill him?
[45:45.15]Kill this guy.
[45:51.94]Should I actually unironically kill this guy?
[46:00.12]I have to.
[46:03.65]Chat wants every NPC dead.
[46:06.57]You know, when I came up here, I was thinking about killing this guy.
[46:08.75]Because he's really stunting on my style of being the fat guy in the big shorts.
[46:14.45]No.
[46:14.75]Do it ironically?
[46:15.59]You can't... No.
[46:16.13]No, no, no.
[46:16.41]We're not going to kill any NPCs yet.
[46:20.39]No one's going to die.
[46:21.17]We're not killing NPCs.
[46:25.90]Let's see.
[46:26.30]There we go.
[46:30.68]Anything else over here?
[46:31.88]No.
[46:36.20]There are chests here.
[46:37.36]Look at that.
[46:39.48]I'll take it.
[46:41.90]On the bones.
[46:46.91]Morningstar and talisman.
[46:51.45]I wonder if I should put that on.
[46:53.75]No, I want to be like big heavy guy.
[46:55.91]I know that there's a sword that I want to use.
[46:59.73]And I'm pretty sure it's down here.
[47:00.91]It's going to be a mimic.
[47:03.71]None of these are going to be mimics.
[47:08.43]Put on the morning star.
[47:12.09]I got to be careful.
[47:13.60]How did that hurt me?
[47:26.05]Let me go wait, I know that there's bad shit in here Wowie okay easy now Where is it I know it's down here somewhere oh My oh big guy big fucking guy big there it is that's the thing I want to use that's the thing I want to use that's the thing I want to use I Got it.

[47:58.38]Okay, hold on.
[48:10.39]I think I want to try it.
[48:11.61]I want to use this thing, don't I?
[48:15.77]Should I use the fucking giant?
[48:16.97]This is the thing I wanted to try.
[48:23.90]Morningstar... What's the effect here?
[48:27.13]Holy shit.
[48:30.93]Don't count that as a death run.
[48:32.01]That was like an item run.
[48:33.11]I haven't even started the game.
[48:36.00]Did somebody just give $250?
[48:38.98]Oh my god.
[48:39.94]What on Earth is going on here?
[48:43.46]Kairotope, thanks for the $250.
[48:47.16]Still got it, huh?
[48:50.08]I still got it.
[48:52.20]You'll see.
[48:53.15]That was an item run.
[48:54.43]It's alright to die there.
[48:57.66]But holy shit, dude.
[48:58.78]Thanks for the... Thanks for the 250 bucks.
[49:06.58]That is one of the biggest donations I've ever had in one bits.
[49:12.74]I think that might be tied.
[49:15.46]I think somebody gave like 500 bucks one time.
[49:19.71]Some people have given 200, 250.
[49:20.37]That's a lot of fucking money, man.
[49:22.77]Thank you.
[49:25.10]That's all I can say.
[49:26.02]That's fucking incredibly kind of you.
[49:29.85]Unable to wield this weapon effectively with present stats.
[49:33.35]So I think I have to two-hand this, right?
[49:35.83]No, I can't.
[49:36.39]It's a strength requirement to two-hand this.
[49:37.99]Let's find out.
[49:48.38]Um... 24 is required.
[49:50.82]Ah, I need... Ah, it's dexterity, isn't it?
[49:55.98]I need 10 decks.
[49:58.24]Well, let's do... Let's put the Morningstar on for now.
[50:05.88]I'll try this for now.
[50:06.54]And we're gonna do it without the shield.
[50:15.98]I also... Take the shield off.
[50:20.51]That's way better.
[50:22.71]Okay.
[50:23.37]Good to go.
[50:24.53]Alright, let me take a look around again.
[50:26.01]Just make sure I don't miss anything.
[50:31.07]I just want to get some items.
[50:32.91]I want to go on a little item run around this place.
[50:36.11]Somebody already took this.
[50:42.58]That's bullshit.
[50:45.55]Death counter.
[50:47.89]That's fine.
[50:48.27]I'll take my first death there.
[50:49.87]I'm alright with that.
[50:50.49]What's over here?
[50:57.22]Now, I know the whole world is interconnected.
[51:00.22]It's a giant puzzle piece.
[51:03.08]And that's what a lot of people just go... Oh, that's why you gotta pull... This is the graveyard.
[51:06.52]Okay.
[51:07.22]Don't need the... There's like a hundred souls down there.
[51:08.72]I don't care.
[51:09.04]Alright, let's go this way.
[51:13.05]Whoa.
[51:13.57]Okay.
[51:14.21]We're fine.
[51:15.47]There's an item there.
[51:18.56]I told you.
[51:18.92]This is the first time I've really actually spent real time doing this.
[51:22.36]So I'm going to spend the time doing it.
[51:25.34]If you're looking for a flashy guy that's still got it, I'm sorry, but you're only going to get that maybe once an hour here.
[51:35.43]Can I get anything else?
[51:36.53]Oh, my God.
[51:37.13]That's a giant bird.
[51:41.45]Oh my god.
[51:42.36]Wait, is that a perspective thing?
[51:43.48]Okay, is he just really close?
[51:48.08]Is he standing right in front of the camera?
[51:49.80]Or is... Where is he?
[51:52.98]No, okay.
[51:53.36]He's very far away.
[51:56.96]That guy probably... That's probably a boss.
[51:58.73]Birdman.
[52:01.67]What does this say?
[52:02.63]Jester.
[52:03.11]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:03.93]Alright.
[52:04.19]I need to do this.
[52:08.43]Because I have to...
[52:11.49]You can pet him.
[52:12.93]I'm not going to do that.
[52:19.69]So let's go over here.
[52:24.83]A lot of these places are different ways to go.
[52:26.77]I got ten Estus right up there.
[52:28.33]Yep, yep, yep.
[52:28.99]Let's go over there and do some collection.
[52:32.57]Pet bird.
[52:33.11]I'm not going to pet the bird.
[52:37.58]You want to pet the bird?
[52:38.22]You open up your own goddamn game.
[52:42.88]It looks like one hit.
[52:50.02]Yeah, I see you up there.
[52:52.80]Cannot do it yet.
[52:53.52]Come over here.
[52:58.57]Right through him.
[53:02.63]This guy's going to drop a bomb on me.
[53:03.77]I'm going to fall here.
[53:08.65]Two guys.
[53:09.51]Yep.
[53:15.43]I told you that was going to happen.
[53:17.03]I could see that from a mile away, and it almost happened.
[53:21.21]I'm fine.
[53:21.51]There's that guy there.
[53:25.18]Let's aggro him.
[53:31.24]I can go down here.
[53:34.00]Is this going to kill me?
[53:39.12]I think you can jump down there.
[53:41.51]Yeah, you can.
[53:42.11]I know you can.
[53:42.73]Is it going to kill me?
[53:45.07]No.
[53:45.43]Okay, good.
[53:46.93]There's something down here.
[53:52.80]There's no enemy right here, right?
[53:58.08]Ring of Sacrifice.
[53:59.08]That's all this is?
[53:59.64]Okay.
[54:02.58]This is here.
[54:04.80]This is here.
[54:07.04]I can just go right... This is not going to kill me, right?
[54:23.28]It's an item run.
[54:24.12]It's an item run.
[54:24.74]There's no way to get back up.
[54:25.82]It's impossible.
[54:31.19]You can't count those deaths.
[54:32.11]That doesn't count.
[54:32.61]I got the thing I wanted.
[54:33.51]There's nothing else over there.
[54:34.43]There's an illusion wall over there.
[54:37.71]God damn it.
[54:47.53]Don't worry.
[54:47.95]I'll get over there.
[54:48.57]Watch this.
[54:49.09]This is how they do it on the runs.
[54:51.32]This is what happens when you get the runs in this game.
[54:59.11]Okay.
[54:59.67]See?
[54:59.75]We're fine.
[55:00.41]The illusion wall is right there.
[55:02.61]That looked like I could go down there though.
[55:06.65]Doesn't it look like you can go down here?
[55:10.19]That's as far as the fall was back here.
[55:17.58]It's not this way.
[55:18.26]Okay.
[55:24.88]Up against this wall?
[55:28.55]These guys are right here.
[55:30.11]I can walk this way.
[55:32.15]Don't you dare.
[55:33.69]Oh, god damn it.
[55:37.36]Did I just get- I actually got jebaited.
[55:38.86]You actually did that to me.
[55:47.80]Fuck you guys.
[55:48.95]Don't do that to me.
[55:49.83]I haven't played this game in like two years.
[55:58.41]It's been a while.
[55:59.23]Come on.
[55:59.65]Like, you can't do that.
[56:00.47]Don't do that to me.
[56:02.83]Don't tell me there's an illusion wall down there for me to go get.
[56:05.17]And get some cool stuff.
[56:06.37]And then have me get stressed out.
[56:08.11]Alright, no more stress.
[56:17.33]I'm so fucking stressed out.
[56:20.43]I can't.
[56:20.93]I honestly.
[56:21.43]Ugh.
[56:30.89]Now I'm like, oh, why?
[56:31.79]This is, like, so easy, too.
[56:33.87]Like, I... It don't even matter.
[56:37.11]I'll eventually shake off this bullshit and we'll get back into it.
[56:50.24]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:51.58]This is like the fucking baby zone.
[57:02.71]Come here.
[57:11.69]Four deaths, keep it up.
[57:12.75]Like, this is... I shouldn't have died one time here.
[57:26.28]Can I pee right now?
[57:26.96]Yeah, oh yeah, I can pee right now.
[57:29.28]It would not be pretty.
[57:35.11]Oh, hey, look at that.
[57:35.77]I made it to the first area.
[57:37.91]The easiest thing you can do in the game.
[57:39.98]Watch out for the rat.
[57:46.42]I think he's dead.
[57:52.77]I do have a lot of these souls, though.
[57:54.03]That's good.
[57:58.13]By the way, I'm playing this game in hard mode.
[58:00.07]You know why?
[58:01.13]And I didn't even think about this till right now.
[58:03.48]I am covered in poison ivy.
[58:05.94]I have poison ivy all over me.
[58:09.86]So I'm playing the game with a mod on.
[58:11.76]It's an itchy body mod.
[58:15.60]You know the thing that Valve wanted to make a long time ago?
[58:17.38]The biofeedback chest?
[58:18.80]I'm wearing it.
[58:20.76]I got poison fucking sumac all over my chest.
[58:23.76]And that's all I can think about.
[58:33.27]Alright.
[58:33.92]Here we are.
[58:34.20]We're at the burg.
[58:34.70]Wait, what do you mean context?
[58:45.45]Alright, let's take a look.
[58:48.41]What am I talking about?
[58:49.59]You want proof?
[58:51.47]I don't have a shirt.
[58:53.31]I'll give you proof.
[58:54.65]Don't worry.
[58:56.14]I'll give you the proof that you so desire.
[59:05.78]Just wait.
[59:06.44]Just wait till I'll take a picture upstairs and I'll send it to myself to the stream.
[59:12.99]Nothing up here, right?
[59:13.99]What about illusory walls?
[59:23.79]You know, like, every, like, eight seconds, I have to take my elbow and smear it up against my left side of my body.
[59:31.71]Nothing else I can do over here, right?
[59:35.71]Can I go over here?
[59:39.39]Hey, look at that I got.
[59:40.25]There's some humility over here.
[59:48.64]Not gonna creep up on me like that, are ya?
[59:53.68]Anything else?
[59:54.51]There's a way to go down.
[59:55.79]Alright, I wonder... I'm gonna take the... No, you know, let me get the bonfire here first.
[60:04.69]Almost just walked right off.
[60:05.97]But it wouldn't even matter because it's right here.
[60:11.30]What is remastered about the game?
[60:14.20]They improved the lighting.
[60:17.20]And it's 1080p.
[60:19.78]That's it, I think.
[60:21.96]Somebody correct me if I'm wrong here.
[60:24.28]But I think one of the only things they did is they made Blighttown playable.
[60:34.70]There.
[60:38.02]This just leads to down here.
[60:42.90]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[60:47.38]Cut the tail!
[60:47.76]Cut the tail!
[60:49.80]I know that you get like a fire sword for that.
[60:52.08]You know why?
[60:52.54]Because somebody told me.
[60:57.73]Not really.
[60:58.35]That's bullshit.
[60:59.85]Come on.
[61:00.91]Whatever.
[61:01.29]Get over here.
[61:13.58]Guys with bows and arrows.
[61:19.09]Those guys have insane reach there, by the way.
[61:22.15]That's so far.
[61:24.95]I jumped across the whole game.
[61:27.35]Did they remaster that?
[61:32.43]Wooden shield.
[61:39.07]Why are there bugs flying around too?
[61:40.59]What?
[61:41.21]Okay, there are like gnats just flying all over the room.
[61:43.93]There's nothing in here.
[61:47.12]I'm playing Dark Souls Remastered Challenge Mode.
[61:49.54]Covered in poison ivy and like surrounded by fucking bees.

[62:44.43]And I gotta get rid of these gnats.

[66:52.58]I feel like I want to try it.
[67:03.53]That's what I want to do.
[67:05.13]That's what I'm going to do.
[67:06.01]Because that's what I want to do.

[67:35.77]Alright, well.
[67:37.45]I feel good.
[67:41.91]I'm not gonna use this the whole game.

[67:48.33]Holy shit.
[67:51.65]Okay, yeah, no, I'm gonna, fuck, forget it.

[67:54.83]What's going on?
[67:55.55]What are you doing?
[67:58.38]You, okay, I can't have this happen in the game.
[68:00.24]I don't know what it is with my cords to connect to my computer, but I, this can't happen.
[68:06.46]I'm gonna be in the middle of a boss fight and this shit's gonna happen, isn't it?
[68:09.63]Oh my god, I hate computers.
[68:14.25]Don't ever buy a computer.
[68:35.22]Okay, well that's me with the keyboard and mouse.
[68:39.23]Hold on a second.
[68:40.27]I think my PS4 controller just died.

[69:01.47]What on Earth are you doing, game?
[69:04.03]Oh my god.

[69:15.88]That's kind of annoying.
[69:21.50]Alright.
[69:22.82]Give me a fucking break, man.
[69:25.06]God, I hate computers.
[69:29.64]So, I... What am I... How do I...
[69:32.81]I'm going to have to restart the game for this to be registered.
[69:50.33]Why?
[69:50.71]Why do I have to restart?
[69:52.09]What's with...
[70:00.49]Okay.
[70:01.13]Well, let me make sure this is actually plugged the fuck in.
[70:06.63]You guys do know that that's going to happen.

[70:52.68]I think I actually do.
[70:53.40]I gotta change controllers.
[71:00.91]What a pain in the ass.
[71:07.83]I don't want to play on an Xbox controller.
[71:09.47]I hate playing Souls games on an Xbox controller.
[71:14.93]It's like harder for me for some reason.
[71:16.97]I don't like it.
[71:21.16]It's where the triggers are.
[71:23.48]Like L1 and R1 make this annoying clicking sound.
[71:29.54]Whatever.
[71:32.11]Where'd my headphones go?
[71:38.79]Well, it works.
[71:41.39]Yeah, I just don't like this.
[71:45.27]Every time I swing the sword, I hear, like, I'm clicking on a button.
[71:50.56]You know, whatever I have to do with it.
[71:54.26]Alright, let's go.
[71:55.60]Sorry for that.
[71:58.60]Although I do have... Let me use these.

[72:43.48]Over-leveling?
[72:45.12]Well, I have the materials.
[72:46.26]Alright, let's do it.
[72:57.35]Running R1 is pretty good.
[72:58.53]Hello.
[73:02.35]Hello.
[73:06.56]We're not going that way.
[73:07.42]We're going this way.
[73:10.08]Fire arrows over there.
[73:18.07]Oh, shit.
[73:18.71]199.
[73:18.75]Oh, my God.
[73:22.15]I really don't like how slow I am, though, with the roll.
[73:27.82]I like that animation, though.
[73:39.01]Animation's good.
[73:41.92]What about this door?
[73:43.34]Does not open from this side.
[73:44.44]Okay.
[73:46.04]Anything else in this room?
[73:47.44]Nope.
[73:52.20]The dude in here... Actually just hit me.
[73:57.97]Come on.
[74:00.77]Take off the clothing?
[74:01.57]Yeah, but I don't want to get insta-given.
[74:03.33]You know?
[74:03.59]I don't want to get insta-given.
[74:09.25]Well, you're a guy.
[74:13.89]Short sword.
[74:15.66]Not using that.
[74:16.40]I have to be careful, though, because of the... I'm carrying around items.
[74:20.84]That's going to be bad for me, isn't it?
[74:23.98]Don't I not want to do that?
[74:33.62]Look, this is not a mimic, right?
[74:34.96]They would not introduce a mimic this early into the game.
[74:38.09]I'm certain of that.
[74:41.28]Why would they do something like that?
[74:42.22]That would be cruel.
[74:46.70]Just use the helmet?
[74:49.45]Is that enough protection?
[74:54.19]Now, I do remember that there is... There's a Black Knight over here from the last time I played this.
[75:02.82]And he is a pain in the ass.
[75:04.12]Come on, Swain.
[75:09.38]Stupid.
[75:15.28]Two short swords?
[75:16.06]I don't want two of these.
[75:20.06]Okay, these guys can run and jump on.
[75:29.30]No, that can go over there.
[75:36.39]And it's firebombs.
[75:37.51]Would you look at that?
[75:42.19]You both throw them?
[75:42.99]Yeah, you do.
[75:46.47]Oh, God damn it.
[75:47.45]I'm not close enough.
[75:48.81]Get closer, man.
[75:49.83]You're going to do that to me right now?
[76:06.04]Did you... Punk.
[76:10.68]Yeah, this is remastered.
[76:14.21]This is the remastered version.
[76:15.31]What about down here?
[76:17.23]A skeleton's going to come behind me.
[76:18.41]That's how it usually works, right?
[76:23.87]Not that I can see.
[76:24.45]I could go over that way.
[76:25.69]What's over here?
[76:27.85]Go for it?
[76:28.26]I mean, I could.
[76:28.76]So what is this?
[76:32.64]Can I get a secret item?
[76:37.86]No, there's no secret item there.
[76:45.16]Illusion wall?
[76:49.50]Oh, it's just a regular ledge.
[76:55.00]Well, at least... Okay.
[76:56.75]Figured that out.
[76:57.57]That was fun.
[76:58.07]Let's go back up here.
[77:08.17]Mm-hmm.
[77:11.05]Use the key.
[77:12.50]So...
[77:15.09]There's the reason why I downloaded that key.
[77:18.85]Just to, what, skip that area?
[77:20.35]Is that a mimic?
[77:27.06]Gold pine resin, of course.
[77:29.80]So the master key is just, hey, eventually in the tutorial zone, you're going to get a gold pine resin.
[77:34.08]That's funny.
[77:40.75]Hi there.
[77:47.33]You next.
[77:52.11]Whoa!
[77:54.22]Guy with the arrow!
[77:56.16]Oh, man, oh, man.
[77:59.66]He's up there.
[78:00.18]Okay, he's up there.
[78:01.14]I need to sidestep.
[78:06.37]What the fuck am I doing?
[78:08.73]Oh, I have one-hander right now.
[78:10.33]Well, that was embarrassing.
[78:18.44]Didn't know you were up here.
[78:19.52]Anyone else?
[78:26.32]Just a beautiful view.
[78:27.40]Alright.
[78:34.21]Now, from what I remember, there's a bad guy down here.
[78:37.59]There's a really bad guy down here.
[78:41.07]We're gonna take him on right now.
[78:42.43]I'm ready.
[79:11.35]Oh, that, I gotta, that hit recovery is bad right now.
[79:16.61]Okay.
[79:17.51]Black Knight Sword!
[79:18.67]Damn it!
[79:22.62]Oh well.
[79:31.48]Blue Tearstone Ring.
[79:34.27]What's that?
[79:39.81]Boost defense while HP is low.
[79:43.55]I mean, what?
[79:46.12]Put it on, right?
[79:49.38]The rare gem called Tearstone has the uncanny ability to sense imminent death.
[79:54.18]This blue Tearstone from Katarina boosts the defense of its wearer when in danger.
[79:58.63]This is one of those things where you don't lose souls if you die.
[80:00.51]Okay.
[80:02.63]Well...
[80:07.98]What about walls here?
[80:09.37]I feel like that's not it.
[80:12.31]Illusion wall, maybe?
[80:13.07]Something like that?
[80:17.80]Maybe that is just the only thing over here.
[80:23.56]There is a spot down here, though.
[80:25.96]What's over here?
[80:35.41]Oh, nothing.
[80:36.83]There's just a... Got ya, you walked too far and fell.
[80:40.69]Okay.
[80:41.07]Well, you're not gonna get me.
[80:47.21]Nothing else?
[80:49.48]Okay.
[80:50.98]Back up here.
[80:53.26]Did I get the master key?
[80:54.16]I did.
[80:56.78]Now, look, I'll tell you.
[80:58.14]I'm not against, you know, a little bit of help here and there.
[81:02.30]If there's something, maybe...
[81:06.17]There's an invisible bridge.
[81:07.19]Oh, yeah.
[81:09.15]I'm sure there is.
[81:10.14]I'm sure there is a great invisible bridge.
[81:17.28]I know what you're gonna do.
[81:17.96]Do it.
[81:18.16]I'm not even gonna give you a chance, buddy.
[81:29.03]There's a boss up here, isn't there?
[81:34.67]Master key.
[81:53.04]Down, down, down, around the spiral.
[82:02.28]Who the fuck is that?
[82:04.61]Oh god, he's following me.
[82:06.77]He's following me, he's following me.
[82:10.26]Their aggro range is tiny, right?
[82:12.74]Yeah.
[82:16.61]Oh, God.
[82:17.67]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[82:19.21]I don't want to fight this guy.
[82:20.87]How did I escape this guy?
[82:27.03]Why is his aggro range so huge?
[82:29.03]They're not supposed to... Okay, detonate him.
[82:30.85]He's going to detonate him.
[82:35.41]Oh!
[82:38.89]I got to go through the smog.
[82:41.67]Let's go, buddy.
[82:42.39]You want to fuck with me?
[82:44.26]No, he's got like the charcoal turkey.
[82:45.70]Let go.
[82:49.02]I'm safe.
[82:49.94]Okay.
[82:50.54]That was fucking terrible.
[82:54.74]Okay, he can't go through that, right?
[82:58.15]Wait.
[82:58.79]Hold on.
[82:59.31]I remember this.
[83:00.29]Damn it.
[83:00.55]I wish I turned my souls in.
[83:05.37]I remember this.
[83:06.07]You fight a guy on a bridge here.
[83:11.89]That's the demon, right?
[83:12.85]It's the guy with the big Taurus Demon?
[83:17.72]I am going to take off something.
[83:19.60]Because I can't be rolling around like this.
[83:23.16]What if I take the pants off?
[83:24.06]It's actually not that big of a deal.
[83:32.79]Fuck it, just leave it on.
[83:36.65]I think I can do this with four Estuses for a try.
[83:38.85]I don't know.
[83:47.01]Just go in there with bare feet.
[83:48.15]Should I top myself off?
[83:49.45]I'm going to.
[83:49.97]Knowing me, I'll die.
[83:52.51]Alright, hold on.
[83:55.15]I want to put items on.
[84:00.44]Is my equipment farther?
[84:02.66]Alright, so... I feel like this is kind of... No, we're not going to... Let's just go at him.
[84:10.26]Here we go.
[84:12.94]There he is.
[84:13.82]Is he just like a charge or something?
[84:15.14]Alright, quiet.
[84:15.79]Quiet!
[84:15.99]Quiet!
[84:25.86]Ooh, okay.
[84:29.12]Ooh!
[84:36.10]Back it up, back it up.
[84:38.38]Okay.
[84:46.94]Well that was lucky.
[84:51.53]That was real lucky.
[85:07.94]Damn it.
[85:17.50]There it is.
[85:17.94]See you later.
[85:18.28]Okay, we're good.
[85:18.68]We're fine.
[85:18.98]That wasn't so bad.
[85:29.85]Humanity, Homeward Bone.
[85:32.85]I got a lot of souls here.
[85:33.85]I don't want to screw this up.
[85:38.18]Havel's back.
[85:40.26]Imagine if he was just right here.
[85:42.24]He just started sprinting behind me.
[85:44.14]He's not right here, right?
[85:44.96]I feel like I can hear him.
[85:49.02]No, he's not here.
[85:49.80]We're good.
[85:52.12]Um... Okay, let's go.
[86:00.20]See, I just had to wipe off the cobwebs and get a weapon that I wanted to use, and there you go.
[86:04.44]Everything's gonna be fine.
[86:17.24]I don't know if I want to use this weapon the whole game, though.
[86:22.00]I want, like, a bigger two-hander.
[86:23.66]Can I use this?
[86:30.56]Locked.
[86:36.93]Oh, wait.
[86:37.61]There he is.
[86:38.07]There he is.
[86:38.41]This is the guy, right?
[86:40.37]praise me to the light right ah hello you don't look hollow far from it I am I can get the turkey leg the lord of sunlight now that I am undead I have come to this great land the birthplace of lord Gwyn to seek my very own son you find that strength praise the sun praise the sun praise the sun no need to hide your reaction I get that look all the time
[87:09.54]No, you can't kill this guy, otherwise the internet will find you.
[87:13.00]Isn't that how it works?
[87:19.40]I would actually be afraid.
[87:21.34]I would fear for my safety if I killed this guy right now.
[87:26.11]What's my decision?
[87:26.87]Of course it's yes.
[87:27.69]Yeah, Dave Internet will come and get me.
[87:38.79]Why not help one another on this lonely journey?
[87:42.81]Sure.
[87:43.27]This pleases me greatly.
[87:45.49]Well then, take this.
[87:46.71]So if I kill him, do I get all of his stuff, right?
[87:48.79]We are amidst strange beings.
[87:50.39]The flow of time itself is convoluted, with heroes centuries old phasing in and out.
[87:56.33]Why does everybody love this character?
[88:01.52]Because he came up with the meme.
[88:03.82]He's got like a fucking Jerma planted on him.
[88:06.10]He's so likeable.
[88:06.98]Anything else?
[88:20.82]Oh, hello there.
[88:22.12]The sun is a wonder, if only I... You gotta talk to people, like, five times in these games.
[88:27.64]Oh, hello there.
[88:28.80]There's people.
[88:30.28]There it is.
[88:30.66]Praise the sun.
[88:31.76]What if I just, like, fucking booted him off the edge?
[88:35.62]Yeah, take that, Dave Internet.
[88:39.88]Well, so... We're gonna move on to... The bridge.
[88:47.96]I think.
[88:51.33]Yeah, this is a dra- this is a dragon comes over and goes... I know- I know- I didn't know I could time it that well, but that- I knew- I think I may have fucked myself.
[89:10.42]Did I fuck myself for life here?
[89:12.86]Was I supposed to run?
[89:16.76]I think I may have fucked myself for life.
[89:19.27]I think I have to go this way.
[89:27.74]I have too many souls!
[89:34.46]Don't T-Rex, don't T-Rex, don't T-Rex, don't T-Rex me, don't T-Rex me, don't T-Rex me!
[89:40.65]Ooh!
[89:42.69]Am I safe here?
[89:46.09]Okay, I'm safe.
[89:55.03]I don't want to lose all these, man.
[89:55.99]I don't have any Estus either.
[90:02.54]Is Havel down here?
[90:08.57]Wait a minute.
[90:10.83]Ooh, look at that.
[90:12.67]The first skip of the game.
[90:15.41]Oh, wow.
[90:15.95]Look at how interconnected the world is here.
[90:19.40]How are they so connected?
[90:22.40]That leads up to the dragon bridge?
[90:28.28]Well...
[90:30.15]Do something I'm missing here.
[90:32.95]Because, again, I have not really played very much of Dark Souls 1.
[90:38.31]I didn't get a boss soul item.
[90:40.69]Do those not exist in Dark Souls 1?
[90:52.42]Just hold B on a ladder?
[90:53.48]Okay.
[90:53.90]Let's get 15 vitality.
[90:55.96]Um... I wonder if
[91:02.77]Soft caps are in this game too, right?
[91:04.71]Like 20, 30... I wonder if I should just try to soft cap myself with Vitality and Endurance.
[91:15.00]They're different on every one of the games, right?
[91:23.35]40 strength and 40 dex.
[91:24.13]Okay, 40.
[91:25.37]I think I'm going to...
[91:32.47]Let's just get strength to a position where I'm, you know, unstoppable.
[91:40.90]Somebody's saying resistance is a good idea.
[91:43.40]What's the resistance self-cap?
[91:47.90]All strength.
[91:48.46]40, okay.
[91:50.86]Well, I'm alright with this.
[91:52.39]I'm going to leave strength alone for now after this.
[91:57.43]White caps are 30 and 50, okay.
[92:01.91]Get resistance.
[92:04.39]Hold on, I have a bunch of Crunch Berries I can eat.
[92:12.59]I want to make sure I don't overdo it, though.
[92:15.39]Do I need for a level?
[92:20.81]Resistance got nerfed.
[92:22.13]It does almost nothing.
[92:24.20]Okay, well that's good to know.
[92:26.26]Thank you.
[92:27.52]Thank you for the tips!
[92:31.86]oh not quite there alright I gotta kill a couple of uh cronies out here come on oh no I wanted to run 16 was it 16 something 1680. I think 50.
[93:01.56]that should be enough I could go this way remember I was gonna go look that way and see what's down there I might do that first let me get one more point into get these bugs away from me man let's go endurance again take off the hat
[93:31.95]Why is my nose a zebra?
[93:41.41]I'm gonna check out over there first.
[93:46.95]You could just get hit by everything.
[93:55.66]No, I'm undead.
[93:56.72]That makes sense, I've died.
[94:03.06]It's such a giant... I'm actually Gonzo.
[94:07.74]The idea was... It was... Hold on.
[94:10.18]Oh, no.
[94:10.76]Yeah, this way.
[94:13.84]The idea was I was trying to be a skier from the Honker Burger.
[94:21.67]Let's explore.
[94:24.05]Right?
[94:25.03]I wanted to.
[94:26.65]So I'm going to.
[94:30.69]And experience all of Dark Souls and everything it's got.
[94:34.83]I thought that was an empty... Okay, easy now.
[94:44.13]Easy, guys.
[94:45.47]Oh my fucking god.
[94:50.58]Why did I stop?
[94:51.60]I don't know why I stopped.
[94:52.82]There was no reason to stop.
[94:55.94]Let me explore.
[94:56.78]I'm exploring over there.
[95:07.08]You know, just go by them.
[95:09.44]You don't need to stop at these people.
[95:10.70]Just run by them.
[95:12.56]They're not going to do anything for you.
[95:13.96]There are two of these fucking dummies.
[95:15.89]Oh, great.
[95:26.11]Oh, great.
[95:37.64]Wanted to do.
[95:47.72]Didn't really want to do that, but okay.
[95:52.81]You are annoying me.
[95:53.87]I don't... He's annoying me.
[95:57.55]I want to dump these short swords.
[96:02.69]Okay.
[96:03.47]Back over here.
[96:04.70]Just heal.
[96:07.58]You fucking asshole.
[96:09.32]What the fuck?
[96:10.74]Alright.
[96:11.06]Don't freak out.
[96:11.84]There's some enemies here.
[96:14.52]You need to fight them.
[96:21.89]There they are.
[96:32.02]I feel like I need more poise.
[96:34.02]I'm very slow to get up.
[96:40.89]Okay, out here.
[96:41.67]There's nothing.
[96:48.15]This is the way.
[96:48.65]Okay, this is where I want to go first.
[96:50.71]Because back there.
[96:52.49]Jump up here.
[96:54.29]This leads me this way.
[96:55.79]And there is a bad guy that climbs up.
[96:57.53]Where is he?
[96:59.41]Where is he?
[97:02.83]Take a look down here.
[97:05.41]There he is.
[97:06.47]You're a little late.
[97:11.02]I'm gonna make this funny.
[97:12.38]Check one two.
[97:14.44]Check one two.
[97:15.22]What am I doing?
[97:15.64]Why am I doing that?
[97:22.02]He's not dead.
[97:23.40]Ooh, what's that?
[97:25.00]He's not gonna climb up again, is he?
[97:26.96]Oh, goddammit.
[97:27.93]Just kill him.
[97:36.76]Just go down.
[97:38.06]Go down.
[97:42.84]Get the fuck away from me.
[97:45.44]Goodbye.
[97:46.22]Okay.
[97:48.78]Funny job.
[97:49.48]I wasn't trying to... I just... Whatever.
[97:51.76]Alright.
[97:54.28]Here we go.
[97:55.96]Item.
[97:58.31]Oh my god.
[98:02.79]There are four of them.
[98:11.51]Okay.
[98:17.09]Rubbish.
[98:19.07]If there was rubbish in Dark Souls 1, why?
[98:22.57]Remember, at every corner, there's a potential for a fucking troll face.
[98:31.72]See?
[98:37.92]At every turn, at every moment...
[98:41.27]Something bad can happen to you in these games.
[98:43.87]So there's a guy, and I would have freaked out, and I would have hit the explosive barrels, and I would have blown myself off the grid.
[98:58.13]Is that it?
[99:00.91]Someone's going to throw a bomb, and it's going to explode.
[99:03.73]No, okay.
[99:06.49]We're good.
[99:13.09]What's the point of this?
[99:16.91]No illusions?
[99:22.11]I guess not.
[99:22.65]This is a staircase.
[99:31.41]This is the item I saw before.
[99:32.61]It's a soul.
[99:37.20]I mean, the construction is pretty good, but... What is this?
[99:50.33]I guess I have to open this somehow.
[99:57.53]Maybe not.
[99:59.85]Now I'm trapped.
[100:02.38]It's a House Flipper.
[100:04.60]Well, that has to be opened somehow.
[100:08.54]Am I offline?
[100:09.34]Yes, I'm currently offline.
[100:10.36]I don't plan on playing the whole thing offline, though.
[100:13.29]Just maybe the first part.
[100:15.28]Because I gotta get back into it.
[100:16.50]And I'm also scared of being banned from the game by somebody that gets into my game and throws a magic ban ball at me.
[100:24.61]So I guess I can't do anything here yet.
[100:29.79]Back to where we were going before.
[100:30.91]At least I know that exists.
[100:40.68]Can't be banned on PS4.
[100:42.40]I thought, but I already owned the Prepare to Die edition.
[100:46.13]And you got, it was 50% off discount if you bought it through Steam, if you had it on Steam.
[100:54.17]So, I mean, I could have, it was $40 or $20.
[100:58.19]And I was like, you know, why not just take the $20 discount, right?
[101:06.82]Back up here.
[101:09.02]And nothing else.
[101:10.04]Back to where we were going.
[101:13.38]You can back up your save.
[101:15.46]So is that shit still happening, though?
[101:16.84]I feel like I don't want to take any chances.
[101:24.94]What am I going to miss?
[101:29.87]Alright.
[101:31.45]Let's climb back up.
[101:32.43]Do I have enough for... I think I might have enough for another level.
[101:42.45]Not quite shit.
[101:47.87]18.
[101:48.69]I guess I'll be fine.
[101:53.92]He doesn't see the stairs?
[101:55.16]What do you mean?
[102:01.30]I'm the worst?
[102:02.00]What are you talking about?
[102:06.63]What's going on?
[102:08.53]What's going on?
[102:09.37]What's happening?
[102:10.67]What did I miss?
[102:11.59]I missed something?
[102:18.24]Stairs back at that platform.
[102:25.12]I've never done this before.
[102:41.07]Swing.
[102:42.75]You know, I did tell him to swing.
[102:43.89]Are you guys talking about like outside here where I was back here?
[102:59.72]Or are you talking about in that room?
[103:03.78]Don't say jebaited.
[103:05.08]Is this for real?
[103:05.84]Is it like actually somebody here?
[103:12.83]I see something over there.
[103:13.67]I'm getting japed.
[103:20.05]Jupitered.
[103:20.43]Oh, okay.
[103:22.83]Right here.
[103:23.19]Let's see.
[103:25.11]I mean, this shit's covered in boxes.
[103:27.45]Come on.
[103:30.15]Can we swing so I can get behind you?
[103:34.80]Fine.
[103:35.74]Just don't swing and I'll just take care of that.
[103:37.58]Alright.
[103:44.63]Okay, cool.
[103:49.69]Yeah, I see you.
[103:52.89]You can't play that trick on me.
[103:54.51]I've already played your other game.
[104:02.62]This game doesn't have a punisher that follows you around, right?
[104:06.30]I made the mistake of playing Scarlet of the First Sin as my first Dark Souls 2 kind of run-through at
[104:15.63]Let me see what this is.
[104:16.25]I don't want to hit the fucking bombs.
[104:30.85]Nothing?
[104:31.23]Okay, good.
[104:33.89]I'll go back there.
[104:34.47]I just want to check out all the options.
[104:39.56]I'm essentially in the main menu of this level right now.
[104:43.00]Alright, I'm just taking a look at the options.
[104:45.39]Scrolling through.
[104:50.33]I'm going back, don't worry.
[104:51.35]I just want to see what's up here.
[104:54.11]Yeah, I played Scala first.
[104:55.11]But that was the remastered edition.
[104:58.97]For Dark Souls 2.
[105:01.39]I didn't know.
[105:01.85]I didn't know any better that the game was insane.
[105:09.04]They just put a bunch of new monsters everywhere?
[105:10.82]Alright, so that was just to get here, and this can go from here up to there.
[105:16.17]Not really that big of a deal, but let's go back down.
[105:20.69]Scholar is the superior souls game?
[105:24.59]Um, I don't really have an opinion.
[105:31.58]They kind of just added and replaced monsters.
[105:37.11]Didn't they move some NPCs around, too?
[105:42.10]Hey, look, a guy.
[105:44.64]What if I just saw his... Hollow!
[105:45.72]Kill!
[105:45.96]Missed crossbow.
[105:56.89]He doesn't read.
[105:57.83]He doesn't need.
[105:58.99]Oh, I thought you were mad at me.
[106:00.09]Let's talk.
[106:03.35]I told you, people are going to get angry with me for not going down certain hallways.
[106:07.59]It's going to happen.
[106:08.49]OK, so what do you got?
[106:21.52]Repair Powder, Throwing Knife, Firebomb, Talisman, Dried Finger.
[106:25.38]That's the thing where it's, come on, bring me three people in my game, right?
[106:29.77]Residence Key.
[106:33.73]Box Allowing Inventory Management at Bonfire.
[106:39.27]Dagger, Short Swords, Batar, Napier, Hand Axe, Glove.
[106:46.94]I don't know.
[106:49.00]I would say I should take this.
[106:53.15]Because this is the parry shield, right?
[106:55.15]But I don't think I'm ever going to be parrying very much.
[106:57.19]I already have that master key.
[107:02.07]What about this armor?
[107:06.49]Is there a way I can compare this to what I'm currently wearing?
[107:10.11]Should I get the chain armor?
[107:14.51]They didn't add that feature, right?
[107:17.51]What a waste.
[107:18.35]Go and
[107:25.24]No, it's 23.
[107:25.94]No, this is better.
[107:28.44]This might be better, but I might weigh less with that on, right?
[107:34.41]What's the weight on this?
[107:35.13]It's heavier.
[107:42.15]I should get the residence key.
[107:43.71]I have the master key, though.
[107:45.04]That's the same thing, right?
[107:48.42]What about the bottomless box?
[107:49.44]Should I get this?
[107:53.20]I can buy more than one?
[107:54.00]No.
[107:58.07]Poise is important.
[107:59.03]Yeah, I was looking up stuff about it.
[108:04.03]You get poise from... Do you get it from leveling something in particular?
[108:08.39]They're different keys.
[108:09.17]How much is it?
[108:09.83]A thousand souls?
[108:15.22]I'll get it.
[108:15.58]Whatever.
[108:15.90]Fuck it.
[108:18.00]I'll keep the sword I have on now.
[108:20.52]Small leather shield.
[108:21.62]How much is the small leather shield?
[108:24.52]I can always come back and fucking steal it, so who cares?
[108:26.99]Thank you kindly.
[108:28.69]You get it from armor.
[108:33.47]Get the box.
[108:38.97]Oh.
[108:40.37]Should I get the box?
[108:41.55]Don't get the box.
[108:42.97]Do I need to get the box?
[108:44.01]This is what happens when like the game's been out for like fucking a decade and everybody knows everything's so secret and everything knows everybody knows all the stuff but I don't.
[108:54.12]Should I get the box?
[108:58.72]You need to get the box.
[109:05.47]You don't need the box.
[109:06.53]Get the box.
[109:07.37]Box is useless.
[109:08.23]Alright.
[109:08.83]I got the key.
[109:09.43]I got one half of what you guys wanted me to buy.
[109:16.21]All of his key items are super important.
[109:18.06]Okay.
[109:20.10]You don't need... Chat's debating again.
[109:22.82]Alright.
[109:23.42]Well, I'm getting nervous, so I'm just going to play.
[109:27.29]You can't beat the game without the box.
[109:29.79]Well, looks like I'm never going to beat the game.
[109:33.35]I did get the residence key.
[109:38.71]Not reading chat.
[109:40.25]How is that possible?
[109:41.39]I'm literally answering like every question.
[109:44.82]This guy's not reading chat.
[109:48.70]He's just replied to like 28 messages in a row.
[109:56.61]We're going back up to the dragon.
[110:00.97]You can't do a blind playthrough of this on Twitch.
[110:03.83]Yes, I can.
[110:04.49]It's fine.
[110:05.11]It's alright.
[110:06.35]I understand.
[110:07.11]I understand.
[110:11.50]Like, I get it.
[110:13.38]I know that some of you guys have beaten this game like 45 times.
[110:17.20]I know.
[110:17.72]And it's a great game.
[110:18.56]It's a fucking classic.
[110:19.74]One of the best, right?
[110:22.72]I understand.
[110:23.16]I know.
[110:23.54]I know what you mean.
[110:24.54]I get you.
[110:25.28]You're watching me right now.
[110:26.36]Go over here and you're like, fucking idiot.
[110:28.34]Like, get off of that platform.
[110:30.30]You're gonna get smoked by the fire.
[110:32.56]Oh, he's so dumb.
[110:34.88]I know and I understand.
[110:35.84]I get it.
[110:44.28]Like, why is he doing this?
[110:45.82]Oh my god.
[110:46.70]Why is he going over here?
[110:47.98]I don't know because I'm just... I wanna see the game.
[110:53.82]I want to see what it's got.
[110:56.60]This is a whole other way to go.
[110:57.62]Is that a rat in there?
[111:00.75]Or is it a bird?
[111:05.23]What's that?
[111:05.63]Monster.
[111:06.01]Okay.
[111:08.09]In here.
[111:08.41]Okay.
[111:10.90]Hold on.
[111:11.18]Hold on.
[111:11.48]Hold on.
[111:11.72]Hold on.
[111:12.00]Hold on.
[111:13.18]Get back over here.
[111:13.92]They're going to fall to the edge.
[111:16.46]No, they're not.
[111:22.23]What is that path thing?
[111:22.97]Give me a break.
[111:24.49]I missed.
[111:29.39]Thank God you got stuck up.
[111:32.61]I hear people walking around.
[111:37.86]Who's walking above me?
[111:45.08]I'm going in there.
[111:45.74]I'm holding the... I'm doing the priest.
[111:48.06]If there's demons in there, I'm holding my... I told you.
[111:53.02]Don't poison me this early in the game, Jeremy.
[112:01.68]I asked nicely.
[112:04.14]I did.
[112:06.13]I really did.
[112:13.85]Poison Ivy all over me.
[112:16.95]Well, okay.
[112:21.93]Might as well die.
[112:22.84]Yeah, I'm... Where am I?
[112:25.84]Is there another bonfire over here that I can cleanse the poison ivy off me from?
[112:32.53]Undead Parish.
[112:35.73]Can I open this?
[112:36.37]There's a bonfire in there.
[112:39.05]Well, thanks for standing still.
[112:43.70]Wake up!
[112:51.85]Hmm.
[112:53.39]What's that?
[112:55.27]What's that thing?
[112:59.31]Is that... Is that a mechanical giant dog?
[113:08.86]What do I have to do?
[113:09.36]If I told you this early in the game, it's just not... I'm gonna have to die.
[113:12.60]Really?
[113:12.78]Really?
[113:21.54]How are you alive?
[113:22.66]You're alive.
[113:24.38]Wow, good for you.
[113:25.08]Alright.
[113:27.82]Um... Face me.
[113:29.97]Come on.
[113:31.57]Here we come.
[113:32.07]Here comes the charge.
[113:32.89]One, two, three.
[113:35.59]Well, I didn't dodge it.
[113:36.95]I want to walk on.
[113:44.09]Please!
[113:56.92]Poison, man.
[114:02.55]Like, wasting all- I've wasted four Estuses on poison.
[114:14.30]How much does this shit weigh?
[114:16.86]Get away from me.
[114:21.14]Should've gotten the goddamn box.
[114:26.26]What's my weight at?
[114:30.26]How do I see my weight?
[114:31.68]There it is.
[114:33.30]14 out of 56.
[114:37.04]No.
[114:41.42]No.
[114:43.08]It has to be less than... How much does it have to be?
[114:52.20]No, I'm just a fucking weirdo.
[114:54.98]Can I put on the shoes too?
[114:56.10]Okay, I can do pants and helmet.
[115:02.22]What about the arms?
[115:03.86]Probably not.
[115:04.80]No.
[115:08.36]Let's give this a try with the pants.
[115:10.67]There we go.
[115:11.17]Okay, let's try this.
[115:14.75]Back to the dog.
[115:15.37]Don't get poisoned by the stupid rats.
[115:21.89]Minus 25%.
[115:22.21]Okay, cool.
[115:29.93]I could go up, too.
[115:31.59]No, I'm curious about this place.
[115:37.34]Go kill Havel.
[115:38.16]You think I can take Havel right now?
[115:45.26]No, I wanted to lock onto this guy.
[115:46.34]If you kill Havel, I can get more equipment to load.
[115:54.63]Shield.
[115:58.53]Shield.
[116:00.71]Watch out for the rats.
[116:03.59]I need to time this correctly.
[116:09.99]That sucks.
[116:10.56]That's a hard place to fight these guys with a huge sword like this.
[116:18.12]If I get poisoned again, I'm going to... I'm going to... I can't even think of the thing I'm going to do.
[116:28.33]We're good.
[116:29.37]About the same guy.
[116:30.85]Alright.
[116:31.65]Let's go.
[116:31.99]I'm gonna kill that dog.
[116:37.47]How do I pronounce gravel?
[116:43.39]Was his name Havel?
[116:46.69]I'm gonna go up.
[116:47.65]No, let's... I'm gonna go up this time, just to see.
[116:52.67]I know my souls are down there, but what is this?
[117:00.89]I hear something.
[117:04.87]Okay, it's one of these guys.
[117:08.37]Is there anybody else that's gonna be throwing bombs at me?
[117:11.04]Shit!
[117:24.46]Shit!
[117:37.94]What a pain in the ass.
[117:42.84]Like, I killed me in one hit.
[117:44.99]I'm just trying to, like, explore.
[117:46.55]Yeah, I did put the controller down.
[117:57.50]The chase...
[118:00.64]You gotta stay patient, though.
[118:02.26]Like, I can't run.
[118:02.98]This is dangerous up here, regardless of anything.
[118:06.14]Stay patient.
[118:07.02]It's not a big deal.
[118:07.76]You're fine.
[118:11.63]That's gonna be a hard fight to fight that guy up there, especially when he kills me in one swing.
[118:22.01]Didn't get him.
[118:27.02]I'm still... I mean, yeah, I could just run by the dragon, but I want to, like, see what else is over here.
[118:32.52]I'm not trying to beat the game as fast as I can or get to the next thing as fast as I can.
[118:36.01]I want to, like, see all the shit.
[118:47.82]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[118:51.06]That's dog shit right there.
[118:55.44]Have we got that dog shit in my neighborhood?
[119:25.52]Went that way why did it dodge that way I'm running under the dragon, you know I wanted to explore and see the world, but now I'm just gonna run past the dragon You guys like I can't do that I Have to go this way
[120:02.07]Wait, just wait.
[120:03.49]Oh, again?
[120:12.70]Okay, there he goes.
[120:14.72]I thought he was gone.
[120:31.32]I just wait till he gets down.
[120:32.64]I see him jump off and fly and I'm like, alright, he's gotten down.
[120:36.11]Apparently not.
[120:36.91]How long have we waited?
[120:48.76]Alright, breathe the fire.
[120:58.22]Get rid of these dumb idiots.
[121:05.16]Run across butt naked.
[121:06.28]No, that'll burn.
[121:10.42]I need the drake sword.
[121:11.90]Can I... I can get something from this guy, right?
[121:14.02]If I chop this guy's tail off.
[121:27.43]Okay, don't pick those up.
[121:28.25]Get the fucking tree.
[121:29.49]Get the tree.
[121:31.09]The little tree.
[121:32.09]The Charlie Brown tree.
[121:33.23]Got it.
[121:35.74]Should I fight him?
[121:39.69]He doesn't come in here, right?
[121:40.53]He can't come in here.
[121:41.07]I don't think he can get in here.
[121:56.24]Claymore.
[122:00.58]I didn't have any souls.
[122:01.40]Why did I just do that?
[122:12.24]I got a... What's the Claymore?
[122:14.06]Okay, we got this Wayander.
[122:19.14]Battleaxe.
[122:19.62]This is 130 plus 50.
[122:21.44]With... What's the scaling on this?
[122:23.72]C and D. Okay.
[122:28.25]Shortsword.
[122:28.83]Shortsword.
[122:29.35]Shortsword.
[122:30.57]Claymore.
[122:31.05]103 plus 35.
[122:32.35]This is C and C. Ways less.
[122:41.64]It does a little bit less damage.
[122:46.94]It's smaller.
[122:51.50]It's faster.
[122:52.26]Ooh, I like that move.
[123:02.45]I think I'm going to use this, I think.
[123:04.47]At least for a little while.
[123:10.14]And I can one-hand this.
[123:11.50]That's kind of... It's faster than an Ultra, slower than a straight sword.
[123:18.10]Alright.
[123:19.88]I'm just going to check it out for a little while.
[123:24.03]Just for a minute.
[123:25.77]Alright, now I got some options here.
[123:27.91]I can go up there.
[123:28.99]This is... Oh, this is the... Okay, that's... Yep.
[123:33.58]I very faintly hit it.
[123:34.78]This is where the metal pig is, right?
[123:39.89]Yep, there's metal pig.
[123:40.67]Can I kick this?
[123:43.85]What's down there?
[123:44.81]Have I been up?
[123:45.57]No, duck it.
[123:46.29]This is where the mean guy is.
[123:47.53]Let's get rid of the mean guy.
[123:54.86]Wait for the guy to come behind me.
[124:00.34]Where is he?
[124:04.02]Come on.
[124:05.63]You came behind me last time.
[124:06.61]Did I already kill him?
[124:16.80]Well, that doesn't fucking even hurt you.
[124:25.57]Why did I do that?
[124:26.31]Why did I do that?
[124:27.77]Why did I do that?
[124:31.72]Why did I do that?
[124:35.68]Come on, fight next to the bonfire.
[124:46.35]Ooh, that was quick.
[124:52.55]Fuck you.
[124:58.32]That's so slow!
[125:33.20]Oh, fuck that move!
[125:47.38]Gotta wait.
[125:56.52]Shit in my pants.
[125:58.39]I'm in trouble.
[126:08.49]Back step.
[126:12.35]Back steps.
[126:13.23]Oh, god damn it.
[126:14.23]I forgot they were even in the... God damn it.
[126:24.44]Fucking R2.
[126:25.72]Shit, I can kill him.
[126:31.35]Come here.
[126:31.65]I'm sick of this shit.
[126:37.74]Wasn't there, apparently.
[126:44.50]Oh, well.
[126:45.25]No, the guy's chasing after me!
[126:48.15]Fucking goddammit.
[126:54.23]Why did my first backstab attempt not work?
[126:56.15]I don't understand.
[126:56.97]I want- I gotta get- I have to practice.
[127:05.30]I have to get that down.
[127:07.35]because I really felt like I was behind him there.
[127:12.39]And watch out for the fucking guy that runs up, the stupid guy.
[127:16.05]Why don't we have a guy go up behind him?
[127:20.49]That'd be fun.
[127:26.31]Just dual shield him?
[127:27.53]No, I'm gonna try for the backstab again.
[127:35.05]There it is.
[127:36.61]That still doesn't do very much damage.
[127:51.19]Don't do that.
[128:08.57]Ooh, shit.
[128:09.41]I was being cocky.
[128:10.67]Don't!
[128:12.51]Where am I?
[128:12.83]Why am I still on the ground?
[128:14.67]Why was I still on the ground?
[128:17.47]Is my poison zero?
[128:18.38]Come on.
[128:27.30]Let's go.
[128:27.54]I'll just get the shit out of me.
[128:34.81]Alright, I'll get the backstab here and he'll be dead.
[128:40.10]Really?
[128:42.29]How is that not a back step?
[128:47.19]No.
[128:47.69]Just hold on a second.
[129:07.96]Come on.
[129:13.26]There it is.
[129:13.66]Alright.
[129:14.76]Now give me my Black Knight's weapon!
[129:18.82]Alright, now let me level up.
[129:29.23]I just wanted to explore.
[129:34.35]That's all I wanted to do.
[129:41.54]I'm gonna reset.
[129:45.56]Let me do the thing that all your favorite Dark Souls players do with their eyes closed.
[129:57.70]Do it again.
[129:58.08]Reset.
[129:59.18]Longsword?
[130:01.98]What's that?
[130:02.40]Okay.
[130:10.14]80 and 27, it's even smaller.
[130:12.86]Hold on a second.
[130:13.38]Let me see.
[130:21.33]So it's like Longsword, Claymore, Zwyander.
[130:29.58]Longsword?
[130:30.48]What could that possibly be?
[130:31.92]I'll stick with the Claymore.
[130:35.80]Now that I have the Claymore on, though, can I, like, wear this?
[130:39.70]Yes, I can actually wear my armor.
[130:41.82]What about the other one?
[130:44.34]Twelve.
[130:44.90]This puts me at thirteen.
[130:46.16]Okay, I can actually wear my gear with the Claymore on.
[130:51.68]Alright, let's go, let's go kill the pig.
[130:59.81]You making sure the mods update my death counter?
[131:03.49]I'm not against updating the death counter, but, you know, I'm just, I'm trying, I'm trying to see the world.
[131:18.35]Don't use the baby weapon.
[131:19.41]Want me to go back to this Weander?
[131:24.55]Really love a walk on there.
[131:25.77]Mr. FromSoftware These guys shoot arrows, I'm not gonna go fight the pig there's a place to the left place to the right We're gonna go the right staircase.
[131:41.50]I Probably can drop down on that guy I'm not gonna get go for here.
[131:46.92]I'm gonna okay.
[131:47.82]I'll make sure if I'm gonna get go for it.
[131:49.30]I
[131:55.15]Okay, this gets rid of these guys and I can go for him.
[132:07.74]Almost fell off.
[132:12.06]Falling off is bad.
[132:17.43]Alluring skull.
[132:19.81]Okay, so there he is.
[132:28.24]so I can't reach him if I do it like can I do like a jumping attack he backed away if I jump it's happening I'm gonna die
[132:56.29]I'm gonna die.
[132:56.99]I'm not gonna make it.
[132:57.65]I'm gonna jump in front of him, right?
[132:59.55]It's gonna be putting dinner down for him.
[133:03.11]Do a speedrun strat?
[133:04.19]Oh, now you gave me the speedrun strat and you spoiled it.
[133:08.67]I have to beat him the gamer way.
[133:11.05]I'm not gonna beat him the spoiler way.
[133:20.82]Up his ass!
[133:27.15]Why are they not hitting him?
[133:36.87]Oh, come on.
[133:37.28]Really?
[133:38.94]That should have been up his ass.
[133:40.04]Bullshit.
[133:42.24]That's bullshit.
[133:42.82]That should have been right up his ass.
[133:43.84]That should have been up his ass.
[133:44.66]You all know it.
[133:45.10]Does this guy come back every time?
[133:57.31]I had to do it the gamer way.
[133:59.63]Leering skull is a cool... That's a perfect copy.
[134:05.43]But it's not original.
[134:09.02]I'm not going to follow him.
[134:11.00]This is bait here.
[134:14.56]Told you.
[134:17.47]Yep.
[134:17.57]Right here.
[134:28.78]Anybody else?
[134:30.72]I gotta pay attention here because this is one way to go.
[134:35.89]Looks like... So after the pig is dead, you can go down.
[134:38.51]What about over here?
[134:40.65]This is... He's behind a wall.
[134:42.39]Nothing I can do about it.
[134:44.39]But that is the only way to go.
[134:51.08]Zero poise.
[135:00.03]Let me take a look at some toys.
[135:02.94]Is there is there a place I could get three?
[135:09.00]Oh, man, why this stuff?
[135:10.35]This thing sucks.
[135:12.59]This thing sucks.
[135:28.22]three poise hype alright now I can what am I at right now 20 out of 56. no I'm gonna take the pants off I think no that feeling when you pick brigand as a class maybe I should put take the helmet let me see the stats are
[135:58.26]I mean, no.
[136:01.70]Remove the helmet.
[136:04.89]Yeah, I'll take the helmet off.
[136:06.97]So now that the helmet's off, can I put the gloves back on?
[136:09.01]No.
[136:11.53]I'm just gonna wear like a shitty bunch of brake pads.
[136:14.49]Okay, whatever.
[136:15.13]I got like car parts on me.
[136:32.05]Got them both, okay.
[136:33.35]Broken sword.
[136:34.13]One over there.
[136:38.67]Good and dandy.
[136:40.15]Let's do it.
[136:44.31]Ow.
[136:46.09]Running out of Estus.
[136:48.61]Estuses.
[136:54.17]Mystery key.
[136:56.56]Interesting.
[136:58.50]Maybe open some mystery door.
[137:06.59]That feeling when Jerma is mad, cause bad.
[137:08.97]I'm not, what am I, why am I mad?
[137:12.21]I'm not mad right now, I'm having a good time.
[137:25.14]Large soul, good.
[137:26.08]Okay, that's it.
[137:31.62]I'm not, why am I, I'm not mad, who said I was angry?
[137:35.17]Does my voice just sound angry?
[137:37.41]I might just have one of those voices.
[137:46.63]What is that?
[137:47.01]I think this is a boss with one Estus.
[137:51.53]I'm not sure this is a good idea.
[137:57.85]Is that like a shortcut I can... No, I already got it.
[138:11.97]Okay, that's not a boss.
[138:13.55]Sometimes they do that, right?
[138:16.65]I do remember.
[138:17.23]That is a thing.
[138:20.39]Oh no, it's one of these super enemies.
[138:22.35]I really should put a shield on for this guy, probably, right?
[138:28.44]I should parry this dude.
[138:34.46]Terrible place to fight him.
[138:59.55]Let's go see what he was guarding.
[139:03.11]The head slam.
[139:10.80]I love the jumping R2 in all these games.
[139:14.08]I can't get over it.
[139:14.68]I know it's so detrimental to my health.
[139:19.38]But you know, sometimes I just can't be stopped.
[139:22.77]Alright, which one of these is a good shield if I need to parry?
[139:31.12]That shield is a noob trap.
[139:38.29]I can see that.
[139:46.65]I love it!
[139:47.17]I love doing that!
[139:47.95]Am I gonna get to a boss or a bonfire or something here?
[139:56.56]Eventually.
[140:13.75]Nice dodge, man.
[140:21.16]Shit.
[140:24.14]I need to get behind this guy and backstab him.
[140:25.62]You know, I'm going to use it just because I know I'll get these both of these guys.
[140:28.96]Not in this tiny little traffic jam.
[140:33.85]What the fuck are you?
[140:35.01]What the fuck are you?
[140:47.91]Come on.
[140:54.78]Got it.
[140:55.08]Alright, anybody else?
[140:58.58]That scared the shit out of me.
[141:00.40]Actually, I just had a panic attack inside of my stomach.
[141:11.41]Straight or to the left?
[141:16.17]No, I don't trust this bridge.
[141:18.77]This is a rickety ass bridge.
[141:19.95]No, I'm not going on here.
[141:20.91]I'm not going to walk on that.
[141:24.60]Not right now.
[141:25.24]I want to see what's over here.
[141:35.91]Ooh, there it is.
[141:37.49]Okay, don't do anything stupid.
[141:47.77]Just open it, just open it, open it, open it, open it.
[141:49.61]They can't hurt you if you open it.
[141:56.74]Get out of my fucking way!
[141:58.86]That's okay, I opened the damn door.
[142:05.83]I hate when they just keep you locked and you can't go anywhere.
[142:11.13]I hate that.
[142:12.43]That sucks.
[142:18.85]It's alright.
[142:19.35]It's open.
[142:20.63]I did what I needed to do.
[142:21.69]The door has been opened.
[142:31.99]Try killing them.
[142:32.67]Yeah, but I mean, when there's two guys slashing every five seconds, it's hard to do that.
[142:38.42]Then panic sets in.
[142:47.88]Alright, don't need to barb others, just get over there.
[142:58.55]Dude, they don't make them like they used to, you know what I mean?
[143:00.13]Like this one.
[143:01.13]Don't lose all those souls, you stupid person.
[143:04.55]You are such a dumb person.
[143:05.67]I was trying to dodge, but I didn't do that.
[143:18.57]Alright, so here we go.
[143:21.84]Basement key.
[143:24.24]Where does that take me, I wonder?
[143:26.20]Probably into the basement.
[143:28.14]I feel like these guys gotta go.
[143:29.12]They're gonna be so annoying.
[143:33.21]If I step foot up there, those guys run out.
[143:34.81]So let me see, is anything else up here?
[143:41.21]Before I get embarrassed by these guys.
[143:45.31]Step by two of them at the same time.
[143:46.63]No, just one.
[143:47.05]That's fine.
[143:47.53]Okay, let's go, buddy.
[143:57.36]Bring out the other one.
[144:02.56]Is it... Is that Havel in there?
[144:04.38]Does he just show up?
[144:08.68]Come on.
[144:11.38]I knew it.
[144:11.82]I knew it.
[144:12.22]I fucking could smell him.
[144:15.69]I could taste him in the air.
[144:17.73]I smelt and tasted that guy in that room.
[144:20.86]This is bad.
[144:24.76]Didn't hurt him.
[144:51.43]Wrong!
[144:52.05]Wrong!
[144:53.05]Wrong!
[144:54.25]Wrong!
[145:04.39]Fuck!
[145:04.95]Get me away from this guy!
[145:06.41]Okay, calm down.
[145:28.57]What else?
[145:28.93]I feel like I should go level up.
[145:36.56]There's a place to go over there.
[145:38.04]I'm not going to go into the big bad guy yet.
[145:41.12]Let's check.
[145:41.60]I want to see if it's this way.
[145:46.56]This guy is this way.
[145:53.25]You asshole.
[145:54.79]What?
[145:55.81]They can do that?
[146:05.82]Now this just brings you back to that rickety bridge.
[146:07.54]Alright.
[146:08.40]Back inside.
[146:13.34]So this room is now clear.
[146:14.18]It's just me and this guy.
[146:16.12]Right?
[146:17.72]I hope so.
[146:18.32]Because I don't... I don't know.
[146:19.94]There might be like another two guys in here.
[146:22.84]I hear walking.
[146:38.39]Ow, my body.
[146:42.82]Oh, my whole body hurts.
[146:45.27]I'm sorry.
[146:45.61]My whole body hurts.
[146:47.81]This is why you can't... You can't have like a... I'm going back.
[147:06.81]Don't kill me.
[147:07.31]Don't kill me.
[147:07.85]Don't kill me.
[147:10.51]Thank God.
[147:10.85]Alright, I gotta make it over here.
[147:16.63]Guy's shooting arrows.
[147:17.91]And I let it hit me.
[147:18.81]I have to just run by.
[147:21.96]He did the same thing I did.
[147:24.44]Something here.
[147:24.90]Something.
[147:25.34]Something.
[147:25.60]Give me something.
[147:29.54]Bonfire right here.
[147:30.34]Come on.
[147:31.08]Give it to me.
[147:31.54]You know you want it.
[147:32.18]Bonfire.
[147:35.33]Bonfire.
[147:39.22]I hear Harold the Smith is down here.
[147:40.42]There's a bonfire down here at Harold's domain, right?
[147:50.01]Oh, thank goodness.
[147:59.55]Kill the blacksmith immediately.
[148:00.89]I feel like that would be the worst thing I could do.
[148:04.62]Alright, let's do... Let's do one point here.
[148:09.86]No, I can do two.
[148:10.76]I have, um... Let's see.
[148:15.29]I have at least one of these yet.
[148:17.15]You can hear my ass unclench.
[148:29.91]It's a stressful game, man.
[148:31.77]I'm gonna do Endurance.
[148:36.07]Hey, I know you!
[148:36.51]I'm gonna have like 40 humanity by the end of the game.
[149:05.28]Alright, let's see.
[149:06.96]Learn Gesture.
[149:08.06]Hurrah, thanks.
[149:11.59]So, Reinforced Weapon.
[149:12.97]This is just like, I don't know, I guess... Don't I have two Titanite Shards?
[149:24.85]Oh, I do have it, okay.
[149:26.35]So, I could do Claymore plus one, or Zoolander plus one.
[149:32.07]Reinforced Armor?
[149:36.56]That's... You can do that?
[149:41.93]Broad Sword looks kind of cool.
[149:45.71]Regular Thrust, regular.
[149:49.63]Bastard Sword.
[149:53.06]Regular CC, this is 105 plus 36.
[149:56.72]Battle Axe, I already have it.
[149:58.12]War Pick.
[150:01.50]Oh, the Boxing Gloves?
[150:03.72]Maybe one day.
[150:06.46]The rest of these are... kinda ass.
[150:13.33]Okay.
[150:17.39]Well, I don't really have anything right now.
[150:20.35]Alright, let me just leave.
[150:23.91]I remember this guy.
[150:30.64]I remember this guy.
[150:39.23]I do remember this dude.
[150:41.27]The headless horseman guy.
[150:44.08]Well, that's what he just did to me, isn't it?
[150:51.43]Cut his tail off?
[150:52.03]Cut his tail off!
[151:10.51]he remembers you too that's fine cut off his fucking tail got his tail off so I can get his item whatever it is what's his item oh that hurts
[151:39.95]Don't be greedy.
[151:43.51]He's not a dragon?
[151:45.19]Oh, well that makes sense then.
[151:52.03]It's easier to hit him here though.
[151:54.97]Does it take more damage in the front of the body?
[151:56.82]Not really.
[152:07.56]Really?
[152:08.00]That's horse.
[152:08.76]That's horse manure.
[152:10.91]I dodged it.
[152:11.91]I bumped into the fucking thing on the ground.
[152:23.35]How the fuck am I getting hit by that?
[152:30.27]Is he hitting me?
[152:32.78]I'm so confused right now.
[152:33.76]I really need to put on the other weapon.
[152:53.69]Oh my lord.
[152:55.89]That hitbox is like 12 times as big as what he's looking at there.
[152:59.17]That's better.
[153:17.14]I should have been using this from the very beginning.
[153:29.20]Come on.
[153:29.90]Like, if I used this from the very beginning.
[153:31.36]That hitbox is so stupid.
[153:35.98]I would have killed him in half of those swings.
[153:43.50]He's dead now.
[153:44.92]Like, this guy's fucking dead.
[153:51.57]Guy's hitbox is a beach ball at the end of that thing.
[153:55.41]He's dead.
[153:56.95]Goodbye.
[154:13.49]123.
[154:13.63]You've got to be kidding me.
[154:29.07]Stagger them.
[154:33.69]How many souls did I have here?
[154:47.57]He's already halfway.
[154:50.33]That was greedy.
[155:03.50]Greedy!
[155:07.14]Oh man, I didn't have enough of that.
[155:13.58]Get away from me, rock!
[155:23.78]No!
[155:49.68]Ran out of fucking juice!
[156:12.22]Should get him here.
[156:18.90]Come here.
[156:26.34]What?
[156:26.70]What's with this jumping bullshit?
[156:27.79]He's up like four times in a row.
[156:29.07]Come on.
[156:32.65]Fuck you.
[156:35.73]He keeps doing that fucking dive.
[156:51.70]One more.
[156:52.98]Just do it.
[156:53.33]Fuck it.
[156:55.01]What do I get for killing this guy?
[156:58.99]This is really early.
[156:59.81]Demon Titanite.
[157:00.63]Okay.
[157:05.05]Well, that's... I could go level this thing up now.
[157:14.18]Sometimes you gotta do great.
[157:15.22]Alright, let's... I'm gonna level up the...
[157:22.62]What do I need?
[157:23.42]Didn't I pick up a Titanite shard?
[157:24.97]I thought I picked up a couple of shards.
[157:26.31]Is this because it's a... Where is it?
[157:34.21]Titanite chunk.
[157:36.37]Okay, it's not a Titanite shard.
[157:41.10]Okay, he sells them.
[157:46.36]800 souls each?
[157:47.88]He gave me one.
[157:58.43]Alright, we're gonna... I'm gonna... I feel like Claymore is more versatile, but I'm gonna be so greedy with this thing, it's gonna be bad.
[158:11.36]I feel like it should be this, though, because I want to be heavy.
[158:13.53]This gives it a 113.
[158:23.63]I'll use it for now.
[158:25.58]I'll use it for now.
[158:29.43]I'm gonna go need still just one.
[158:31.10]Alright, well it's plus one now.
[158:38.16]I did want to be big sword guy, that's right.
[158:41.10]If I find something cooler, I'll try it and use it.
[158:46.65]This thing just does so much damage, I feel like it's... You know, why not use it?
[158:57.91]One, one dexterity.
[158:59.41]99 endurance.
[159:03.21]And there's like mic pops.
[159:04.79]I've seen that video.
[159:07.33]I've seen it.
[159:07.66]Okay, um, should I just go?
[159:09.80]Let's pass that guy.
[159:14.80]So there's this out there.
[159:16.86]I could go down and through that little entrance there.
[159:19.46]I just want to see what's over here.
[159:28.68]This is a new zone, it seems.
[159:36.04]I do remember fighting that guy, though.
[159:38.21]Years ago.
[159:38.69]Okay, we, this is, this is a new spot.
[159:45.67]This is, this is land of the, of the glowy forest.
[159:50.50]Is this a poison forest?
[159:51.58]Because if it is, oh boy, am I done.
[159:56.00]Oh, tree people, okay.
[160:00.65]Oh, you are pathetic.
[160:09.29]Darkroot Garden.
[160:13.17]Easy enough.
[160:13.61]Alright.
[160:13.81]Let's take a look.
[160:14.75]Eh, it's beautiful in it.
[160:20.37]Uh, I can go this way, can't I?
[160:25.36]It looks like I can go down here.
[160:27.04]Is this gonna be one of those, like...
[160:29.94]Situations where everyone laughs at me just sliding down here.
[160:34.12]No, I ain't doing it.
[160:35.36]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yes I can.
[160:43.60]This goes deep.
[160:49.96]Darkroot Basin?
[160:58.66]Make sure I get the cookie bug.
[161:04.64]First cookie bug I've seen in the whole game.
[161:06.10]He's alive!
[161:06.78]God damn it.
[161:29.41]this place.
[161:29.81]Hold on, I think I can get that.
[161:40.38]Bunch of leather, leather, leather, leather, leather, feather, leather.
[161:45.96]I mean, is this the way to Blighttown?
[161:50.97]Where am I going here?
[161:51.99]I'm just going this way.
[161:53.47]I don't know what's over here, but we're here.
[161:58.52]Have I ever done this?
[161:59.33]I've had to have.
[162:03.73]Oh, shit.
[162:04.13]What's that?
[162:06.59]Okay.
[162:10.33]Fucking dark!
[162:12.40]The Dark Knight!
[162:16.10]The Black Knight!
[162:17.60]They're not called the Dark Knights.
[162:24.09]Shit.
[162:24.25]He's got a...
[162:31.76]Oh, fuck you.
[162:32.40]That stupid spin move.
[162:34.60]You're so cool.
[162:35.28]The guy with the spear.
[162:41.05]Alright, well, that's what's over there.
[162:56.32]We're gonna check out over here now.
[163:03.96]Oh, look, it's that guy.
[163:04.94]It's that guy.
[163:05.50]I remember this guy.
[163:07.58]Parry?
[163:08.12]I mean, if I'm going to use the Zoolander, then I can't.
[163:12.32]Does he open this for me?
[163:14.10]Oh, hello, it's me, Sigmund.
[163:16.42]Hmm.
[163:17.44]Hmm.
[163:19.44]Hmm.
[163:23.14]Hmm.
[163:23.83]Hmm.
[163:24.99]Oh, forgive me.
[163:26.81]I was absorbed in thought.
[163:28.77]I am Siegmeyer of Katarina, quite honestly.
[163:32.65]I've run flat up against a wall.
[163:34.91]Or a gate, I should say.
[163:36.91]The thing just won't budge.
[163:38.85]No matter how long I wait.
[163:40.96]And oh, have I waited.
[163:43.42]So, here I sit.
[163:45.10]In quite a pickle.
[163:46.40]Weighing my options, so to speak.
[163:48.64]He doesn't look like an onion.
[163:49.74]Yeah, he does.
[163:50.54]It's his head.
[163:51.30]He's got an onion head.
[163:55.01]Still closed.
[163:55.87]Still closed.
[163:57.07]Alright, well, I need to open this for... Still closed.
[164:00.23]Still closed.
[164:03.97]That's it?
[164:04.47]Yeah.
[164:05.65]Well, he'll be happy when I open this.
[164:08.81]Somehow.
[164:10.55]So I cannot go this way.
[164:11.88]Let's go back up to... Out of here.
[164:16.04]If I go up.
[164:18.30]Kind of back where the dragon was?
[164:24.45]The Undead Parish, I could go another way, right?
[164:27.27]Yeah, so let's just get up there and go up.
[164:39.37]Cool.
[164:39.71]I gotta remember that's where the blacksmith is.
[164:43.95]Now I can't remember.
[164:45.77]This cathedral-looking place.
[164:50.81]Haven't I played this one?
[164:51.73]I have never played Dark Souls 1 to its completion.
[164:54.83]I got to Blighttown and a little bit after Blighttown and then I haven't played anything else.
[164:59.07]And it's been a long time since I've done that.
[165:00.70]It's been at least a year or two.
[165:04.22]And this is the remastered version, so you know this is the remastered one.
[165:09.08]Not the one that I play.
[165:10.26]Hey, come on.
[165:11.00]Don't do that to me, man.
[165:16.66]Secret?
[165:17.44]No?
[165:20.27]Yeah, but the scorpion spider queen lady, I beat her.
[165:24.11]And then I couldn't figure out how to get the fuck out of Light Town.
[165:27.89]So I said, I will never play this again.
[165:30.35]I'm too dumb.
[165:30.95]And I left.
[165:41.52]Okay, here we go.
[165:44.71]I have to be careful in here.
[165:46.01]There's like three people in here.
[165:48.57]That's really slow.
[165:58.34]That speeds it up a little bit, though, right here.
[166:08.51]He's not that bad.
[166:09.13]He's just very scary looking.
[166:11.11]Here's a Titanite shard.
[166:11.97]I could do it again.
[166:12.53]Fire Keeper's Soul?
[166:17.15]What does that do?
[166:23.02]I should probably go level the sword up again.
[166:25.30]I think I can one more time, right?
[166:29.94]Is it?
[166:30.52]Yeah.
[166:39.09]What does it do?
[166:40.23]Boost power of Estus.
[166:41.37]Ooh.
[166:44.32]Each Firekeeper is a corporal manifestation of her bonfire.
[166:47.58]It can be used to gain humanity and restore HP at the cost of losing the Firekeeper soul to reinforce the Estus.
[166:53.22]Somebody just told me to use this.
[167:03.39]You.
[167:04.85]Bastard.
[167:07.28]You had me there for a second.
[167:08.73]I didn't know if that was a way... I thought it was maybe a consumable in this game.
[167:13.51]And people are trying to make me... Fail miserably.
[167:21.93]Alright.
[167:23.61]Now where?
[167:26.02]I found the place to go.
[167:28.76]Wait, stairs.
[167:30.12]Always check the surroundings.
[167:31.22]There's always things to look at.
[167:32.38]Like, for instance, this guy's.
[167:38.25]Get out of here.
[167:39.46]One hit.
[167:39.70]Who the fuck is that guy?
[167:47.46]Okay, there's a magician up here.
[167:58.17]Whoa!
[167:58.41]There's a lot of people up here.
[168:02.53]Oh!
[168:03.25]Okay.
[168:03.53]No, I remember this.
[168:04.19]I remember this part.
[168:05.69]There's like 3,000 of these guys.
[168:07.11]I remember this.
[168:10.35]Vaguely.
[168:16.27]Get them all in one swing.
[168:20.36]At least a few of them.
[168:21.54]Okay, got it.
[168:22.44]We're good.
[168:23.56]I think he can bring it back to life, though, can't he?
[168:43.71]okay let's take a look around shall we that drops down there that's the okay that's the guy that was shooting at me earlier that's the beam guy that I freaked out about alright what about you dashing r2 on this dude no no no no no
[169:16.23]Thank God for... It didn't kill him.
[169:20.11]Okay, I panicked, and it's alright.
[169:22.49]Nothing bad happened.
[169:33.14]Something's gonna break through that.
[169:33.96]Right?
[169:35.56]It's gonna smash through.
[169:36.30]It's a perfect breakthrough smash-through side.
[169:38.38]Like the Kool-Aid Man thing.
[169:39.60]It's gonna happen.
[169:41.56]Oh, I can do it.
[169:42.95]It's me.
[169:43.35]It's I that does it.
[169:53.28]There's a guy in here.
[169:58.54]I'm not touching that.
[170:04.87]Break it?
[170:08.91]Should I?
[170:17.30]I'm trying to get, like, a distance here.
[170:18.52]Okay, it doesn't explode.
[170:24.22]Nothing behind him, right?
[170:26.88]I'm just so paranoid that thing's gonna blow up if I touch it.
[170:29.86]Well, he had a humanity on him.
[170:30.88]Let's take another look.
[170:45.02]Hello.
[170:46.84]Still human, are you?
[170:48.53]Then I am in luck.
[170:51.33]Could you help me?
[170:52.89]As you can see, I am stuck without recourse.
[170:58.63]Uh, okay.
[171:04.72]Just let him out.
[171:05.60]Please, I have duties to fulfill, and I will reward you handsomely.
[171:11.42]Well, I am certain you stand to benefit.
[171:17.45]Okay, well, whatever.
[171:18.65]Mystery key.
[171:20.75]Hi.
[171:22.93]Thank you.
[171:23.97]Yes.
[171:25.23]Sincerely.
[171:26.49]I am Knight Lautrec of Kari.
[171:29.51]I truly appreciate this.
[171:31.83]And I guarantee a reward.
[171:34.95]Only later.
[171:38.31]So this guy's going to give me something.
[171:39.29]Okay, well, cool.
[171:40.13]Yes, very sorry.
[171:41.81]Your reward will have to wait.
[171:43.17]So I got a mystery key, let this guy out, and he gives me something.
[171:45.45]Allow me some time.
[171:49.39]I always forget about these games.
[171:50.79]I can get back to work.
[172:01.85]Menacing.
[172:02.47]This guy's menacing.
[172:04.03]Why are you in here?
[172:07.75]Oh, whatever.
[172:09.49]I'll get a humanity when he goes to the camp.
[172:14.64]Kill him.
[172:15.24]Kill him.
[172:15.78]Kill him.
[172:20.37]Why would I kill him?
[172:24.17]I'm not going to kill that guy.
[172:25.17]He's covered in gold.
[172:26.17]He's worth a lot of money.
[172:26.95]That's it up here.
[172:41.29]Kill him.
[172:41.77]Please kill him.
[172:42.65]Seriously.
[172:45.73]Kill him.
[172:46.65]Do you see what he's wearing?
[172:48.41]He's going to beat the shit out of me.
[172:54.25]That guy's going to pull out lightning and I'm going to get one-shotted.
[173:02.05]No, I ain't doing that.
[173:03.95]I ain't going to lose to that guy right now.
[173:09.17]Just want to see what else is up here.
[173:15.69]There was an elevator down that I could probably go to.
[173:18.63]Let me... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[173:27.34]I'm gonna keep him alive.
[173:31.34]Oh, wait.
[173:38.17]There is something over here.
[173:43.59]Explosion.
[173:44.17]Somebody gonna blow this up?
[173:45.67]Ooh, good.
[173:46.87]Large soul.
[173:52.92]There was an elevator right there.
[173:54.08]Okay, I'm gonna look at the... I wanna see the elevator.
[174:02.93]Nothing else, right?
[174:03.79]Yeah, that's where he is.
[174:04.93]That's my last chance to go kill him.
[174:06.65]Oh, I missed my opportunity.
[174:08.01]Alright.
[174:08.51]Elevator time.
[174:09.57]Is that what?
[174:09.89]Is that like a shortcut?
[174:16.03]Did I just miss an item?
[174:16.69]No.
[174:17.05]Alright.
[174:19.49]I'm going to go level up this weapon one more time.
[174:21.41]Alright.
[174:29.84]Here it is, right?
[174:30.46]There it is.
[174:31.30]Elevator.
[174:35.68]Uh, we can... Okay, yeah, this is like a skip.
[174:41.06]Can I jump over that?
[174:41.74]I feel like I can press that button.
[174:50.35]Ah, but hold on.
[174:51.21]Wait, wait, wait.
[174:51.96]There's a thing I can get over there.
[174:53.24]Oh, this goes all the way back to Firelink.
[174:55.96]Okay.
[174:57.20]Now I see.
[175:01.32]This is Firelink again.
[175:02.38]Ah, look at that.
[175:04.06]That's cool.
[175:04.98]Interconnected.
[175:05.58]Alright, so where is this?
[175:13.65]Such an ugly character.
[175:14.71]I know.
[175:16.07]Nothing I can do about it, though.
[175:17.31]I was born this way.
[175:22.09]Interlinked.
[175:24.96]That's right.
[175:27.26]It's up this way.
[175:28.37]It's just the same way.
[175:29.27]I'm going to kill this guy, right?
[175:31.97]Everyone's screaming at me.
[175:38.24]I'll get ten Estus flasks.
[175:45.43]Anything new?
[175:47.12]Well, there are a few ways to go about it.
[175:49.92]Collect it bit by bit from corpses.
[175:52.90]Yeah, Skeeter from the Honker Burger.
[175:54.30]You can butter up a cleric.
[175:56.32]And the quickest way.
[175:57.88]Although I never do coveting.
[176:00.78]So what's the... I know that in Dark Souls 2 they have that meter, right?
[176:06.98]See, there he is.
[176:07.70]See?
[176:09.22]Hey, how are you?
[176:12.10]Kill him.
[176:12.44]Kill him.
[176:12.72]He's a bad guy.
[176:15.44]Sunlight metal.
[176:17.48]What does that do?
[176:18.38]By the Lords.
[176:37.51]Your humanity is really slipping.
[176:40.07]But there are methods.
[176:42.43]Most fools have more humanity than they know what to do.
[176:45.73]Only good guys laugh like that.
[176:47.45]Who do you imagine will make the best use of it?
[176:52.54]Did I free a bad guy?
[176:54.56]Is that a problem here?
[176:55.98]Our futures are murky.
[177:00.78]I kind of want his stuff back.
[177:03.64]This is where I level up my Estus, right?
[177:07.59]Reinforce Estus.
[177:09.28]Yes.
[177:11.56]Estus Flask reinforced.
[177:13.14]She cannot speak.
[177:22.85]No, I'm not going to sleep in my bed.
[177:30.18]I made my decision and I'm going to sleep in it.
[177:36.85]This wraps it down to what exactly?
[177:40.54]More random stuff.
[177:42.14]New area.
[177:45.44]It's dark now.
[177:46.54]Okay.
[177:51.16]Alright.
[177:53.02]So, what is this?
[177:54.64]This is another place to go.
[177:55.94]Okay.
[178:12.05]Pull this?
[178:13.61]Okay.
[178:20.83]New area.
[178:22.08]I think there's a boss back where I was before.
[178:24.82]After that skip, right?
[178:30.22]Probably shouldn't be doing this right this second.
[178:32.26]New Londo Ruins.
[178:36.66]Yeah, I don't think this is an area I need to be in.
[178:39.27]In fact, this is an area I probably shouldn't be in.
[178:45.64]Use the master key, though.
[178:46.68]Okay, hold on a minute.
[178:47.62]Wait a minute.
[178:48.10]Wait a minute.
[178:48.62]Wait a minute.
[178:49.02]Wait a minute.
[178:51.06]Valley of Drakes.
[178:54.80]I'm in like a new zone.
[178:57.52]How did I get here?
[178:59.36]The whole world is interconnected.
[179:03.90]What part of Stormwind am I in?
[179:06.88]I don't know what to... No, this is too much for me.
[179:08.72]This is overwhelming me, Mom.
[179:10.68]No, I'm going back.
[179:14.66]I know this is down here now, though.
[179:15.72]Okay, Valley of the Drakes is down there.
[179:18.87]New Londo is here.
[179:22.87]This is too menacing for me right now.
[179:25.57]I'm going back.
[179:26.05]Is there any random spray items?
[179:32.18]Yeah, I'll take them.
[179:33.12]How is him here?
[179:33.74]Nothing else.
[179:44.43]Hydrate.
[179:44.81]Look, I got... I got it.
[179:46.71]I'm good.
[179:50.51]I got water.
[179:55.62]Okay.
[179:57.78]Back up to the not probably high level, though.
[180:00.34]I'm gonna go level up the sword again.
[180:12.64]And as all of you are aware, it's been like two hours, so that means Jeremy's 75-year-old man bladder has to pee.
[180:21.93]So, fill up your waters.
[180:24.55]See you in two seconds.
[180:26.01]Go grab some... We're still going?
[180:28.07]I want to get at least another boss or two down.
[180:30.17]See you in a minute.
[182:32.49]So if I ever have like a million, if I have a million dollars at some point in my life, I'm going to make, I'm going to install a bathroom inside of my place where I play games or my office or whatever, like streaming or if I'm like, let's say I'm still doing this.
[182:49.72]And let's say like a couple of years, I got a million dollars.
[182:52.24]That's not going to happen.
[182:53.78]But I want behind me to be a toilet.
[182:56.94]I don't care what it looks like.
[182:57.98]I don't care.
[182:58.36]Whoa, dude, you, that's kind of weird.
[182:59.38]You have a toilet in your room.
[183:01.22]Yeah.
[183:02.28]just want a urinal I don't need anything else I don't you don't no full system doesn't need to be a full toilet I'm talking about just a urinal right behind me so I can just unzip go right there piss into the wall and that's it and then come sit back down quick somebody donate a million dollars
[183:25.83]You know, I've had these weird thought bubbles where... Oh, wait.
[183:31.37]Am I in the game?
[183:32.24]I've had weird thought bubbles.
[183:35.58]You know how... Oh, my God.
[183:36.72]This guy got donated like 50 grand on Twitch.
[183:40.96]I don't know.
[183:41.42]I don't know what would happen to me.
[183:43.20]I would... I don't know what I would do.
[183:45.94]I would be scared.
[183:48.35]I'd be like... Wait.
[183:49.47]Hold on.
[183:49.97]What's happening?
[183:51.71]Why are you... What happened?
[183:53.13]No, no, no.
[183:53.79]That's not... Don't give that to me.
[183:55.79]That would scare me.
[184:01.42]Okay, back to it.
[184:02.46]Yeah, here's this guy.
[184:03.22]Let's go level up.
[184:08.58]And now here comes the monologue.
[184:10.11]I use all my crunchies.
[184:13.99]I have a couple of them.
[184:14.87]Didn't you say I was gonna- I said I was gonna eat glass?
[184:22.62]Maybe when I get very upset and I pretend like I'm going to eat bad things.
[184:29.64]Alright, um... Fishing for a 50k donation.
[184:38.67]So what does this do?
[184:41.47]This faintly warm metal engraved with the symbol of the sun is the ultimate honor.
[184:44.31]Awarded to those who summoned the warrior of sunlight and completed goals.
[184:48.92]The symbol represents Lord Gwyn's firstborn who lost his deity status and was expunged from the annals.
[184:59.23]But the old God of War still watches closely over his warriors.
[185:08.66]Okay.
[185:09.60]So this is like a... This is a turn-in.
[185:11.84]This is a rep... That's how you get rep.
[185:13.30]Okay, cool.
[185:14.76]Can I just like throw some of these on the ground?
[185:18.33]I don't... I... These are... Am I getting weight from this shit?
[185:23.69]How does this game work?
[185:24.55]Does it work like the other ones?
[185:25.54]Is this... Do I... Should I throw these in the trash?
[185:27.68]I can sell them later, but they're not causing me a problem now.
[185:34.92]Okay.
[185:38.26]Stop reading lore and play the world's hardest game.
[185:42.68]No, I'm telling you.
[185:43.26]I want to experience this.
[185:47.87]Let's do 20 endurance.
[185:50.59]No, 19 endurance, 17 vitality.
[185:53.31]No, 21 strength, 17 vitality.
[185:56.19]I'm fucking so itchy.
[186:05.70]God damn it.
[186:10.32]Poison ivy.
[186:22.24]Covenant goddamn ivy.
[186:24.76]Fucking hell.
[186:28.58]Alright.
[186:30.16]Uh, let's go.
[186:32.04]It was over here, right?
[186:35.70]I'm gonna get to cover myself in calamine lotion later.
[186:38.00]I feel like I spread it even worse because I put calamine lotion on it.
[186:43.06]Does that make sense?
[186:44.68]Is that possible?
[186:46.88]I spread... I've spreaded the disease more because of that.
[186:56.36]stream it put milk on it is that for real I'll do it wait wasn't there a thing I could dive off and grab here I think there is I take my dog out on a walk and we go like into like a path hold on I think I missed something here I'm pretty sure there's a thing I can dive up on right here looks like it
[187:32.60]I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[187:34.36]Wait, where am I?
[187:43.48]What happened?
[187:44.46]Where am I?
[187:50.11]Oh, um... Huh?
[187:53.17]Whoa, hold on.
[187:55.39]Can I make that?
[187:58.13]I have to try, right?
[188:00.17]I think I can make that jump.
[188:01.61]I think I can.
[188:12.95]Oh!
[188:23.25]What the fuck?
[188:26.77]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, okay.
[188:32.54]So what does that do for me?
[188:36.32]Nothing down here.
[188:38.20]I guess I could get across, but what about over here?
[188:46.70]What is that?
[188:47.91]Oh shit, what's that?
[188:54.15]Pet bird.
[188:54.93]What do you mean, pet bird?
[189:00.48]I can go up even further.
[189:01.68]Hold on.
[189:03.74]It's wild how there's just shit like this in the game.
[189:06.74]Where's the bird nest?
[189:08.36]Oh man, hold on.
[189:09.16]Is this gonna be bad?
[189:10.18]Should I not go to the bird nest?
[189:12.92]If I steal an egg or something, am I gonna get attacked by the bird?
[189:18.97]Curl up like a ball?
[189:31.62]What is it?
[189:32.10]What?
[189:34.54]Let me get the item.
[189:35.48]Yeah, there's an item there.
[189:39.56]This has got to be like DLC or something, right?
[189:44.24]Undead Asylum West Key.
[189:50.29]I already got all that shit.
[189:51.21]What about this?
[189:52.69]There's a hole in here.
[189:55.15]No, that's just the cathedral.
[189:56.31]Ah, I'm free.
[190:06.75]Stop it.
[190:07.23]Let go.
[190:11.84]Alright.
[190:13.76]God damn it!
[190:23.54]I'll get back up there.
[190:24.53]I got more angry at that than anything else in the whole game.
[190:35.47]You can tell, when my voice raises like that, very loud and powerful, that's true actual anger.
[190:44.02]Okay, so again, we just have to go like this.
[190:54.55]Jump over here, jump to that.
[190:56.28]Alright, now get in the nest.
[191:07.22]I'm gonna stand there and see what happens.
[191:11.19]Was that English?
[191:11.95]It was an attempt.
[191:13.65]What about down here?
[191:17.01]Is there something I can get from here?
[191:19.67]Hold on, let me just look.
[191:25.48]This looks like it's something I can do.
[191:27.70]Jump to or land on.
[191:31.19]So many secrets in these games.
[191:32.85]It's too many.
[191:40.72]Come on, don't do this to me.
[191:51.89]Here we go.
[191:53.01]Let's see what happens.
[191:54.41]Curl up like a ball.
[192:00.01]He's gonna come pick me up.
[192:03.41]Or is this... Does anything actually happen here, or is this a waste of time?
[192:09.16]I'm just pretending to be an egg.
[192:17.86]No?
[192:18.06]Okay.
[192:18.26]Okay.
[192:31.19]Where the hell are we going?
[192:40.70]Am I... Am I not gonna be able to give back?
[192:44.14]Okay, no, I just pretend to be an egg again.
[192:51.28]Northern Undead Asylum.
[192:54.64]Wait.
[192:56.40]Hold up, I have the key for here now.
[192:58.20]Didn't I just get... I just got a key to this place.
[193:03.09]Wait, these guys weren't here before.
[193:04.27]Is this different?
[193:20.80]Don't burn me.
[193:22.36]Don't end it here and burn me.
[193:24.85]I told you not to do that.
[193:33.91]Easiest goddamn anything in the game.
[193:35.33]For some reason, I have so much trouble with the biggest shitties.
[193:41.79]I don't know why.
[193:45.33]Item?
[193:47.35]Yep.
[193:56.36]More items?
[194:01.26]Are those guys not the easiest?
[194:07.63]Okay, so what's the deal here?
[194:08.77]What's the super secret here?
[194:11.76]Good job.
[194:12.20]Go straight ahead.
[194:13.04]I'm not even online.
[194:25.11]Alright, so there was a door somewhere.
[194:27.19]Is it down here?
[194:27.75]I feel like I don't want to touch this bonfire.
[194:32.85]But I'm going to.
[194:40.36]Is this a bad idea?
[194:41.66]What the fuck?
[194:55.12]Okay.
[194:59.40]I wanna open the... There was a door, so... There's a Black Knight here, too.
[195:06.67]Why did this place get to be so insane?
[195:13.31]We're gonna do it, regardless of what it is.
[195:18.69]Try to kill the Black Knight.
[195:28.24]I can do this all day, man.
[195:36.06]No, I can't.
[195:36.52]I lied.
[195:36.82]It was a joke.
[195:40.80]I need to get to a position where I can go behind you.
[195:54.10]Bad.
[195:55.37]Bad.
[195:56.13]Very bad.
[195:59.21]What the fuck?
[195:59.77]What's wrong with me?
[196:02.59]She's right behind me.
[196:03.19]I wish I could do like a GTA where I could look behind me right now.
[196:07.89]I wish I could do a GTA right now.
[196:11.29]Look at the rearview mirror right now, GTA.
[196:22.34]I'm up against a wall right now.
[196:26.88]What an idiot!
[196:45.98]Such a bad place to fight this guy, too.
[196:47.80]Seriously.
[196:50.72]What an awful place to fight one of these guys.
[196:54.56]Why didn't I dodge?
[196:56.88]Why did I... Alright.
[196:58.92]What's with the inputs here, man?
[197:05.92]I feel like... I hate to say this, but I feel like sometimes I press dodge and it doesn't do anything.
[197:13.22]Am I a liar?
[197:14.66]What do you think?
[197:15.72]I don't know.
[197:16.80]That didn't do very much damage for a backstab.
[197:37.43]One more of those.
[197:40.02]Greedy, but I had to.
[197:57.45]Red Titanite chunk Open menu, let's see that there's a guy back here I could really use a parry shield.
[198:14.47]Yeah, they do they do come in handy, don't they?
[198:19.28]But I did want to be a two-hander giant sword man, so... I have to live with my decision.
[198:30.11]Who's this guy?
[198:30.59]Do I have to fight this guy?
[198:38.37]Uh... Is this guy hostile?
[198:43.21]Is he hostile?
[198:43.89]He's hostile.
[199:03.19]Here, buddy.
[199:33.88]Not much longer.
[199:34.84]Because, you know.
[199:37.64]Had a chance.
[199:38.20]There it is.
[199:39.24]One more.
[199:42.77]Alright.
[199:44.01]So, he's dead.
[199:47.63]Crest shield.
[199:50.58]So, this is just the aftermath of this place.
[199:52.36]I didn't really want to use that, but I did.
[199:57.82]You have to go for the second attack.
[199:59.39]I know, but the thing is, it's just so slow.
[200:03.57]All my stamina goes away.
[200:04.81]I always want to... I have to be able to move after.
[200:08.77]I just do... Anytime I use a big, big two-hander in any of these games, I want to at least have enough to dodge if I can.
[200:17.92]Because you just... You miss for some reason.
[200:22.80]It's just never good.
[200:25.87]The key is for down here.
[200:27.51]No, it's not.
[200:31.47]There's another one of these.
[200:32.23]More endurance?
[200:43.79]Probably.
[200:48.39]Why am I hearing noises?
[200:55.32]Whoa, that fucking stupid thing!
[200:56.70]Yeah, of course.
[200:58.46]The whole place is taken over by monsters, but there's still one of these guys to roll a ball at somebody.
[201:05.41]You think that that would be it?
[201:06.75]You wouldn't be able to.
[201:11.01]Just in case, you know, this place has been abandoned for 25 years.
[201:14.68]All the new players came in, but we're still here.
[201:16.68]And I'm still ready to roll a ball at you.
[201:31.82]As the Asylum Demon was.
[201:33.44]Uh-huh.
[201:35.80]So, there.
[201:36.32]Here's the door.
[201:36.92]Here's the door.
[201:37.37]Here's the door.
[201:37.99]Right here.
[201:38.49]At least two of these guys now.
[201:39.53]Whatever.
[201:39.81]I'll kill one of them in one fell swoop.
[201:44.23]And the same goes for you.
[201:46.57]Not quite.
[201:47.27]But, you know, I tried.
[201:50.39]Eventually, you're going to die.
[201:58.89]Eventually this will kill you.
[202:00.48]I'm certain of it.
[202:01.42]Okay, so this is the key.
[202:07.42]Used Undead Asylum F2 West key.
[202:12.22]Now what does this do?
[202:13.15]I don't know where I am.
[202:23.33]Rusted Iron Ring.
[202:28.59]Oh, that's how you get that item.
[202:32.51]Ah, okay.
[202:35.39]So that was in the very beginning of the game, and you have to go all... That's cool.
[202:38.47]Now, what does it do?
[202:41.83]Improves balance on poor footing.
[202:48.99]Shackled the guilty, it is terribly rusted and faintly stained with blood.
[202:52.11]Those who find this strange ring to their liking will be pleased to find it easier to gain footing on poor ground such as swamps.
[202:59.32]Oh, thank God.
[203:05.06]Thank God.
[203:05.71]So this poison swamp doesn't even matter.
[203:10.07]You can just walk right through it.
[203:11.23]That's such a huge deal.
[203:12.53]Wow.
[203:12.75]I'm so glad to have that.
[203:16.63]It's staying on forever.
[203:17.61]Alright, so I pretty much did everything I can here.
[203:19.91]I'm going to go level up right out here.
[203:21.89]Alright, that's it.
[203:26.01]Let's go back down.
[203:33.29]the crunchies.
[203:38.85]Other side.
[203:39.55]Level up.
[203:41.35]Let's go with endurance.
[203:44.63]Sure went up.
[203:51.69]It's not going to be enough.
[203:55.63]Oh, I got another endurance.
[204:09.32]Why do I have fucking hockey pads on?
[204:24.73]Yeah, fucking fire enemies.
[204:26.25]Hi guys!
[204:41.55]So that's how you get to this guy.
[204:43.21]Okay.
[204:44.93]Now it makes sense.
[204:48.71]That's how you get to that guy.
[204:50.30]I've always seen that guy in, like, speedruns, and I- I- I tune into speedruns and see people fighting that guy, and I'm like, oh, that's an Asylum Demon.
[205:00.85]So this is where- okay, I get it.
[205:02.05]Let's- okay.
[205:03.01]Can I kill him?
[205:03.61]Is it too early?
[205:11.28]That sucks how it does that to you.
[205:12.44]Alright, is this guy easy or hard?
[205:13.82]Let's see.
[205:17.08]Oh my god.
[205:18.68]Well, I can barely hurt him.
[205:20.28]I don't think I can hurt this guy very much.
[205:36.22]I'm losing my mind.
[205:38.92]Why isn't the dodge not working sometimes?
[205:42.78]Am I going crazy?
[205:47.46]I just tried to dodge and it actually didn't do anything.
[206:02.94]He's going hollow.
[206:07.07]I don't think I can fight this guy.
[206:10.36]Back to the starting room, which is down here.
[206:20.36]That was satisfying as hell.
[206:21.60]Need more endurance.
[206:26.47]I just feel like sometimes it's just... Oh, I pressed dodge.
[206:30.37]Nope, you just don't move.
[206:31.39]Alright, I gotta go back this way.
[206:37.82]Yes.
[206:48.28]Oh, please don't kill me, please.
[206:49.28]Okay, yeah, it's not that far.
[206:57.72]So what's in my bedroom?
[207:03.93]Oh, the Black Knight is in my bedroom.
[207:06.13]Well, that's just, that's swell.
[207:07.41]I don't know why I did that.
[207:12.37]That was a mistake.
[207:22.62]I'm gonna get around him.
[207:23.52]Just get around him.
[207:29.56]We'll have a fucking god.
[207:31.05]Just get around him.
[207:32.07]I don't want to fight him right this time.
[207:33.49]God damn it.
[207:34.31]You just can't even fucking do anything in these tiny hallways.
[207:39.11]Ugh.
[207:42.07]How are you supposed to dodge around?
[207:43.29]You have to run him back into the... Ugh.
[207:46.83]I have to sprint him all the way back into this room.
[207:49.10]No, he doesn't climb ladders.
[207:51.84]Those guys don't fucking... Do they climb ladders?
[207:53.44]I have to pull him into this dark room and fight him.
[207:57.76]With shit that I can't dodge over.
[207:59.54]I love him.
[208:06.85]Fucking sacred.
[208:10.34]dying in the tutorial.
[208:11.24]I just want to go by... There's an item right behind him.
[208:13.10]I can fight him later.
[208:13.89]I just want the item.
[208:16.25]He's going to do a thing where he's going to go straight ahead.
[208:17.81]Fuck you.
[208:26.27]God, you can get back up.
[208:27.32]I want the item.
[208:27.94]Whatever it is.
[208:31.34]Peculiar doll.
[208:33.22]What?
[208:33.40]What?
[208:41.75]Excuse me.
[208:49.03]Let's try this again.
[208:52.41]Wait, bait him out.
[208:53.07]Bait this little lunge out.
[208:57.01]I wanted to run.
[208:57.71]I didn't want to dodge twice.
[208:58.67]Kind of blew it there.
[209:21.78]Do I look like beef jerky?
[209:22.90]Okay.
[209:31.77]Dammit, man.
[209:32.49]I fucking hate fighting these guys.
[209:35.17]Parry?
[209:35.61]I can't use a shield.
[209:37.59]I'm doing two-handed.
[209:38.79]I can't parry.
[209:39.49]This would be a lot easier with parrying, but... I guess I could take off something and put it on a shield.
[209:47.60]I just can't hold this in one hand.
[209:52.87]I want to kill that guy, though, because there's a chance that you can get that item, right?
[209:58.15]And I can't pull him all the way out here.
[209:59.27]I have to fight him in the dark fucking room.
[210:11.75]Can parry with my hand?
[210:16.69]Shut up.
[210:18.03]You can't parry with your hand.
[210:20.20]No, you can't.
[210:22.49]don't please no I can't you can you can parry with your hand four damage that did four why did that do four damage why did that do four fucking damage
[210:50.56]I'm so angry right now.
[210:53.15]I am so angry.
[210:56.18]Because I don't have the right requirements.
[210:57.76]Oh my god.
[211:21.20]Macro menu skills.
[211:28.04]Just go back to two-hander?
[211:29.84]Can you do that?
[211:30.50]Alright, hold on a second.
[211:34.04]So you're telling me that I can... So I can parry and then switch to two-hander and do it.
[211:41.43]I want to try that.
[211:45.07]I'm making this so difficult for myself, but I want to parry with my hand.
[211:48.47]That's so stupid.
[211:51.62]I don't care if I die 15 times here.
[211:53.42]I want to try to do this.
[211:56.80]The timing on this is probably so precise to do it with your hand.
[212:03.06]Okay, let's try it.
[212:10.70]Fuck, I tagged!
[212:14.43]I didn't press triangle!
[212:33.91]I didn't forget, I just like, my brain couldn't like, why R1?
[212:43.34]I'm going for it again.
[212:45.24]I have to, you must learn.
[212:47.74]Learn what?
[212:51.28]Everything.
[213:04.34]Okay, come on.
[213:05.86]I can do this.
[213:09.92]That was bullshit.
[213:10.66]I got it.
[213:14.75]Triangle.
[213:16.37]Hey!
[213:26.08]You guys lying to me?
[213:30.74]Alright, alright, it's strict timing.
[213:33.77]You must look.
[213:38.75]Okay, I wanna, I, I, I'm having, this is fun.
[213:41.51]I'm having a good time right now.
[213:46.65]Where, I know, I, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[213:48.07]I got a little, just... Hand parry.
[213:54.18]Just gotta get closer.
[213:59.82]Get that shit off my screen.
[214:03.16]I did it.
[214:03.50]I did it.
[214:03.89]I did it.
[214:04.55]I did it.
[214:05.67]Look at how close I am.
[214:08.95]I'm so close.
[214:09.83]What the fuck?
[214:14.39]I... I... I did it.
[214:32.73]Why does he keep going in the water?
[214:34.43]I don't know.
[214:38.71]I don't, this is, I'm having a blast right now.
[214:41.91]This is dark, you know, this is Dark Souls, right?
[214:44.19]Got it.
[214:49.87]I switched, I switched, I switched.
[214:52.35]Good, okay, I got it.
[214:58.64]Fuck you game, fuck you game, fuck you game.
[215:27.30]No, I'm gonna blow it so bad.
[215:29.12]I can't blow it.
[215:29.70]Back to the water.
[215:30.32]Back to the water.
[215:30.76]Back to the water.
[215:33.96]I've lost all confidence.
[215:35.31]I've lost all confidence.
[215:36.17]I've lost confidence.
[215:37.43]Is he right behind me?
[215:40.41]Oh, shit.
[215:40.81]I gotta get it right now.
[215:41.61]He's gonna come in here and he's gonna get me.
[215:43.63]He's gonna get me in here.
[215:58.74]I'm telling you, when I start screaming, man, I'm gonna lose my mind.
[216:15.37]Here's the thing, right?
[216:16.43]Okay, if I was alone, if I wasn't screaming, I would be doing the same thing.
[216:22.45]I promise you.
[216:23.81]I swear to God.
[216:26.11]If I was in here with the lights off and the stream not on, I would be acting the same way.
[216:34.20]Oh, man.
[216:35.90]That was... Wow, that was a lot of fun.
[216:41.06]I just had a lot of... That was a blast.
[216:46.89]Alright, so what does this do?
[216:49.39]You killed one enemy.
[216:51.17]I can't believe I did it.
[216:55.99]You didn't know you could parry?
[216:57.01]Well, I didn't know you could parry with your hand.
[216:59.33]Doesn't that defeat the purpose of what a parry even is?
[217:02.87]How would he not cut right through my arm and cut it in half?
[217:08.32]Just because I throw my hand up, he'll slice my fingers off.
[217:15.52]Alright, so what was the thing I just picked up?
[217:23.25]A doll?
[217:28.00]Is it a weapon?
[217:33.74]Where the fuck is it?
[217:34.46]Is it a... Key item?
[217:41.09]It's not there.
[217:44.78]Uh... What does that thing do?
[217:56.97]Okay.
[217:57.15]Alright.
[217:57.69]Now, hold on.
[217:58.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[217:58.99]But before everybody freaks out, I, I wasn't, I, I saw it.
[218:02.73]That, that looked like, that didn't look like a doll.
[218:04.89]That looks like a key.
[218:07.01]That's shaped like a key.
[218:09.60]Whatever.
[218:10.06]You don't call me blind.
[218:10.92]That's fine.
[218:11.44]What does this do?
[218:12.02]This is the first item I saw.
[218:15.40]Look.
[218:20.34]I was talking, I was reading the chat too.
[218:22.05]Like I can get up.
[218:23.39]Let's go on more excuses.
[218:24.69]What do you say?
[218:28.26]I need glasses?
[218:28.82]Yes, I do.
[218:29.34]I have a prescription I refuse to wear.
[218:30.67]Because it makes me puke.
[218:32.87]When I put glasses on, I have a prescription.
[218:34.51]If I wear them for too long, I throw up.
[218:36.33]So that's not going to happen.
[218:37.37]I can't wear them.
[218:37.85]There was once an abomination who had no place in this world.
[218:43.30]She clutched this doll tightly and eventually was drawn into a cold and lonely painted world.
[218:49.92]So I'm assuming this is probably like a DLC item, maybe?
[219:00.78]Because the Painted World was in Dark Souls 3, right?
[219:04.80]From where I remember playing.
[219:12.06]I need new glasses?
[219:13.80]No, okay, I'm going to describe this.
[219:16.22]And I don't know if any of you guys are going to agree with me or listen to me.
[219:19.67]But I don't, when I put glasses on, I don't like seeing the world in liquid crystal display 4K HD.
[219:28.48]From things very far away to right in front of your face, your peripheral, everything is like, it's looking at a video game.
[219:35.32]It's too HD for me.
[219:38.60]I want to see the world in 720.
[219:41.28]I don't like the way the 1080p looks from my real eyesight.
[219:44.56]I don't like it.
[219:45.23]It makes me sick.
[219:52.25]No, it's not nice.
[219:53.29]It's bad.
[219:55.06]Everything's too clear.
[219:56.20]I don't want to see the world clearly.
[220:06.32]I actually asked my optometrist.
[220:09.72]I'm like, hey, if I wouldn't want to put glasses on...
[220:12.91]and it's so clear, it gives me a headache.
[220:15.95]It's like, okay, when I wear glasses, it's the same thing as me being in a VR helmet.
[220:21.39]You put them on, it's like, whoa, everything is fucking crystal clear, and oh, I'm gonna fucking throw up.
[220:28.21]It looks like you're watching a 3D movie.
[220:30.75]So I asked my optometrist, I was like, hey, is it possible, could you give me a mid prescription?
[220:37.77]So instead of full-blown crystal clarity, just, you know, like 720p.
[220:43.21]Just like a little bit of adjustment, and he was like, uh, no.
[220:46.75]We won't really do that.
[220:48.79]Why can't somebody just give me 720?
[220:56.97]Am I high?
[220:57.73]No.
[220:58.31]No, I'm telling you, this is for real.
[221:00.75]Guys, you think I'm fucking weird?
[221:02.94]You think I'm strange?
[221:05.46]You're talking to somebody.
[221:08.04]That, look.
[221:09.89]You're talking to a person that wears one earphone.
[221:14.01]I wear one earphone because it makes me sick if I put them both in.
[221:18.52]If I put these both in, I become a six-year-old and I'm just like, I can't do it, mom.
[221:24.10]I can't do it.
[221:24.72]Are we really that surprised that I don't like to wear glasses because it makes HD puke?
[221:30.00]Are you serious?
[221:39.17]I'm thinking about mom references lately.
[221:40.71]I don't know why.
[221:45.42]Do I have enough?
[221:45.92]No.
[221:47.14]I did pick up a little cheese crunchy, though, didn't I?
[221:51.78]I'm not gonna use it.
[221:53.50]Alright, I gotta go back to the birdhouse, right?
[221:56.54]Because I can't fight this thing.
[222:01.84]Look, I'm not gonna tell you that what I'm saying is... Oh, you should feel that way, too.
[222:07.66]I'm aware that I have some... Yeah, I'm a little quirky, you know?
[222:17.51]I'm aware that that's odd.
[222:20.25]But I can't change it.
[222:21.29]That's just who I am.
[222:29.86]He's a little quirky.
[222:32.08]Just wait, I'm going to get picked up by the giant... I was going to call it a hornet, but it's clearly a crow.
[222:38.13]Alright, pick me up.
[222:38.99]Curl up like one of your French paintings, right?
[222:43.71]Big bits.
[222:44.95]Oh, shit.
[222:49.45]Thank you, Matteo99, for the $100.
[222:57.78]Thank you, Pateo.
[222:59.16]And then you say, when I grow up, I want to be assassinated.
[223:03.82]What?
[223:06.44]What are you talking about?
[223:07.49]What does that mean?
[223:16.27]Am I missing a reference here?
[223:17.23]Is that a reference?
[223:22.55]I don't know any of these references.
[223:25.18]I'm
[223:28.05]But thank you for the $100, dude.
[223:30.97]$100.
[223:35.25]Much appreciated.
[223:35.85]Thank you.
[223:40.87]E. I'm not going to press E. Guess what?
[223:44.25]You can't say E anymore because now it's A. Sorry, guys.
[223:47.80]Alright.
[223:51.58]We're fine.
[223:52.42]Nothing happened.
[223:53.88]I just scraped my knee.
[223:54.70]That's all.
[223:56.32]Oh, look.
[223:56.58]I can pet the bird, right?
[224:02.83]If I just got covered in white shit right now.
[224:09.33]Can I hurt him?
[224:23.12]I'm not going to move.
[224:23.62]He might not be able to know I did it.
[224:26.60]I saw the blood and I freaked out.
[224:27.74]Okay, get me out of here.
[224:30.98]In every Dark Souls, you have to swing at him like three times for them to be aggressive, so he's fine.
[224:36.48]What about over here?
[224:37.04]Did I miss something?
[224:37.79]Pillage corpse.
[224:38.81]Ooh, I did miss something.
[224:42.81]You never know when you're going to find something new, you know?
[224:48.01]It's always a journey.
[224:52.23]And we get to 10, and then we're going to go back in the elevator, and we're actually going to go do the thing we're supposed to be doing.
[225:03.73]Ten.
[225:04.07]How much is this going to get?
[225:07.69]I want more.
[225:08.09]Yeah, okay, let's do it.
[225:09.95]Use them both.
[225:10.81]I should be able to get one more point in endurance.
[225:14.10]Eighteen.
[225:14.86]What is it?
[225:15.16]Eighteen.
[225:16.60]Oh my god, it's way more than that.
[225:18.18]What is it?
[225:19.88]It's twice that almost.
[225:21.14]Whatever.
[225:21.48]Just go into the... I'm not going to assassinate the bird.
[225:32.38]Why am I wearing a thong?
[225:34.48]I don't know, because I'm trying to not bat roll, but I still am.
[225:47.98]I look so bad.
[225:48.72]No, I'm just going to put it back on.
[225:49.93]26, yeah, it's the same thing.
[225:57.95]Okay.
[226:00.19]Alright, mid-rolling, whatever.
[226:11.96]Well, that was fun.
[226:17.78]If all Brigand said is good, just use it.
[226:21.30]If I need to, I will.
[226:21.98]Just put on more armor at this point.
[226:26.18]More like leather gloves.
[226:28.65]Okay, I'm going to put on leather gloves.
[226:31.25]Yeah, I'm going to put leather pants on.
[226:32.39]Leather boots.
[226:34.13]Yeah, that's fine.
[226:41.19]Go up here.
[226:48.26]Look, I didn't even want to fucking fight you.
[226:50.06]I just wanted to go up there.
[226:53.72]Oh, shit.
[226:54.20]Okay.
[226:55.85]Oh, man.
[226:56.75]Oh, man.
[226:57.59]I know.
[226:57.81]There's a boss up here.
[226:58.73]I know it.
[227:00.05]I know it.
[227:00.37]I think it's the... Yep.
[227:01.49]It's the... It's the gargoyle, right?
[227:03.33]Yeah, I know.
[227:03.81]Hold on.
[227:04.27]Okay, I'm good.
[227:10.76]They're coming out.
[227:12.56]Oh my god.
[227:13.92]It's you?
[227:19.67]How did you all get up here?
[227:25.49]I'm just letting you all get up here.
[227:29.66]I need to stop this.
[227:30.66]Did he drop an item?
[227:32.72]No, just go.
[227:35.82]Go, for the love of god.
[227:39.12]Oh, yai-yai!
[227:40.12]Alright, let's take this guy out.
[227:42.58]They climbed the ladder, I know, but still.
[227:45.42]Any items?
[227:49.67]Here comes the gargoyle!
[227:53.01]And then I go ding-dong, right?
[227:57.91]Leather is really bad.
[227:59.11]I should not be wearing this.
[228:00.25]Well, it's alright.
[228:01.71]I'm gonna take out the gargoyles with this terrible armor.
[228:07.04]And yes, I'm going to try to get the tail.
[228:09.70]I know about the tail.
[228:12.40]Haven't beat the Gargoyles?
[228:14.00]No, we spent a lot of time just ticking around and exploring and going in random places.
[228:18.53]I told you, this is not me trying to beat the game as fast as I can.
[228:22.31]This is me trying to enjoy the experience.
[228:25.11]We could have just gone right to the Gargoyles, but why not?
[228:27.90]Why not try some new stuff?
[228:31.60]Holy shit, that does a lot of damage.
[228:37.73]Let's get his... Let's try to get his tail.
[228:47.11]Ah!
[228:47.23]Nope, that ain't gonna happen.
[228:49.03]Give me that tail.
[228:58.80]Here comes the other one.
[228:59.46]I know.
[228:59.78]I gotta... Give me the damn tail.
[229:02.93]Got it!
[229:08.57]Whoa!
[229:09.21]I'm dead.
[229:09.69]I didn't even... Okay, I got the tail.
[229:11.61]That carries over, right?
[229:24.14]Yeah.
[229:24.64]Alright.
[229:24.90]Let me see this thing.
[229:27.08]DC...
[229:30.92]Tied to the gargoyles?
[229:33.88]I'm just, like, trying to cut the tail off.
[229:35.86]I could have, like, tried to beat them.
[229:37.32]I just wanted the tail.
[229:42.41]So what's this regular?
[229:44.35]It's an axe.
[229:45.25]I can't wield it correctly.
[229:48.95]Does this hurt you for putting it on?
[229:53.38]Tying to gargoyles in 2k18.
[229:58.68]What are the... There's something going on right now.
[230:01.15]What does this thing do?
[230:06.85]So this is... I need 14 to really put this on efficiently.
[230:12.03]Gives me a bunch of resistances.
[230:14.17]That's cool.
[230:17.32]Heavier than... Okay, let's see.
[230:24.56]Lighting critical...
[230:31.76]I mean, this thing gives me more.
[230:35.32]Where's, like, the poison resist?
[230:42.98]I'm not seeing, like, the difference here.
[230:44.60]Is it just passive or something?
[230:47.63]Alright, let's go kill him.
[231:00.00]Yeah, I ain't going for speed.
[231:01.30]I'm going for fun.
[231:05.23]It's invisible.
[231:05.81]Okay.
[231:07.71]You wish you could play this game blind again?
[231:09.41]Well, that's what I mean, right?
[231:10.49]So, like, I don't... I've tried to play through.
[231:13.01]One time, I didn't really explore.
[231:15.48]I just went boss, boss, boss, Blighttown.
[231:18.44]I don't like this game.
[231:21.69]And then I really got into Dark Souls.
[231:23.33]I got into the Demon's Souls, Bloodborne.
[231:26.89]I want to enjoy this game and give it the chance that it deserves.
[231:29.11]Alright.
[231:29.29]Alright, but here's the thing, though.
[231:42.72]I do have to get by all these people.
[231:46.68]Wait, what?
[231:50.06]Uh...
[231:53.66]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[231:55.38]Where the fuck am I?
[231:57.93]Was that a different elevator?
[232:01.55]Shouldn't that have gone... Am I going crazy?
[232:07.67]There's two elevators here.
[232:10.13]Did I go in the wrong one?
[232:10.79]Is this the...
[232:45.66]Alright!
[232:46.36]Hey, hey, hey!
[232:47.32]We're good to go!
[232:58.29]I'm... I honestly... I'm... I'm... How could I be so thick?
[233:08.92]Can I just get by you?
[233:09.82]I just... I don't want to even fight you.
[233:10.88]Just let me...
[233:14.32]You have to make this a pain in the ass for me, don't you?
[233:25.63]For some reason, I didn't... Okay, I gotta be careful.
[233:27.65]That's not being careful.
[233:31.47]In fact, that's me losing... I'm gonna die to these dumb chumps.
[233:38.61]Fucking top IQ.
[233:51.33]Go in.
[233:54.61]He's already here.
[233:55.41]Whoa, he's here!
[234:00.51]Nice jump.
[234:13.84]Dying to the gargoyles in 2018.
[234:15.90]It'll happen to me, don't worry.
[234:24.91]Well, don't worry.
[234:25.47]It'll happen.
[234:29.17]Why do I keep jumping?
[234:30.13]Will you stop jumping, dude?
[234:32.83]Drink!
[234:38.85]Oh my god, I'm gonna lose.
[234:47.64]Stop with the fire!
[234:52.22]I asked you a question.
[234:53.32]Oh god.
[235:00.87]Oh god, I said it, I said it.
[235:02.41]I said it and it's gonna happen.
[235:05.05]I said it and it's gonna happen.
[235:09.21]My face!
[235:12.01]Oh, I'm gonna die to the gargoyles.
[235:37.76]I'm psyching myself up so much.
[235:42.20]This is like, they're so easy.
[235:43.38]Just kill them, dude.
[235:44.18]What are you thinking?
[235:50.51]I just, I got so nervous.
[235:51.93]Don't fall off the house!
[235:55.53]I got so nervous, like, thinking about laughing people laughing at me for not beating the gargoyles.
[236:02.21]And then I was like, wait a minute, what if I don't beat the gargoyles?
[236:09.42]Seriously, like, I...
[236:13.68]Don't ask me.
[236:15.82]In my brain, I'm like, yeah, Gargoyles are fucking easy, man.
[236:18.08]Easiest boss in the whole entire series.
[236:20.20]But what if I don't beat them?
[236:21.60]No, you're going to beat them, dude.
[236:22.40]But what if you don't?
[236:23.28]People will laugh at you.
[236:24.57]No, don't say that.
[236:25.69]You just got hit by the fire twice.
[236:26.91]I know I did.
[236:28.33]You're a failure.
[236:29.01]I'm a failure.
[236:30.11]It's going to happen.
[236:30.65]It'll happen.
[236:31.67]And then I finally, right there, I killed him.
[236:32.99]And that was when I snapped out of it.
[236:36.75]That was a lot of souls, though.
[236:37.91]Okay.
[236:40.42]Look at these guys.
[236:41.06]Think you're gonna come get me?
[236:43.10]Nope, don't think so.
[236:46.74]Yeah, I got the tail already.
[236:49.73]I already collected the tail.
[236:50.81]They're all gonna laugh at you.
[237:00.59]Uh, no items?
[237:02.76]What kind of bullshit is this?
[237:11.14]This is the first bell you ring, right?
[237:17.29]Those leather pants make my ass look really big.
[237:23.91]They actually do.
[237:26.01]They do, you're right.
[237:29.61]Big like a yoga pants butt.
[237:32.31]Oh, man.
[237:43.57]Maybe you'd be better if I could see them.
[237:45.77]I can see just fine.
[237:59.30]God, I wish that ladder were me.
[238:04.38]What?
[238:06.20]What does that mean?
[238:10.39]Hey, you rang the bell.
[238:11.67]Good for you.
[238:14.31]So now I gotta go back to... Don't fall off this ladder.
[238:23.42]God, where's that ladder with me?
[238:29.59]Oh, man.
[238:31.75]Why?
[238:32.39]That has nothing to do with the yoga booty.
[238:41.70]Okay, that's a good guy.
[238:43.14]Doing the T-pose.
[238:44.70]He's probably the faith trainer, I assume.
[238:47.21]My body is so itchy.
[238:47.91]Okay, well, abandon covenant.
[238:49.05]Request absolution.
[238:50.41]Well, what is it?
[239:12.13]purchase item purging stones report trespass of invader reduces curse build up and breaks curse that's kind of good there's a list of players karmic justice I don't I don't have miracles it's talisman blood bite ring boost bleeding resistance boost poison resistance do the gesture
[239:54.25]This guy's cool.
[240:07.00]He did it.
[240:10.04]What?
[240:12.39]Oh my god.
[240:14.71]Do it facing towards him?
[240:27.21]What does that do?
[240:27.69]Alright, I'm outta here.
[240:42.73]Buy a purging stone?
[240:45.69]Nah, I can always come back and get it.
[240:50.09]I'm assuming he stays here the whole time.
[241:04.04]Is there like a faster way?
[241:06.26]Do I have to go all the way back here?
[241:07.22]Or is there a faster way to go?
[241:08.98]Secret?
[241:11.62]Is there a secret?
[241:12.20]No.
[241:18.56]I need to go level up the sword.
[241:20.98]Buy at least one.
[241:21.76]Okay, I'll get one.
[241:24.21]I want to upgrade the Zwander.
[241:25.69]You can bone back.
[241:28.91]Yeah, that's true.
[241:33.55]I can warp there by jumping off the roof.
[241:35.33]Yes, but I lose a bunch of shit.
[241:38.70]Purging stone.
[241:40.40]So which one?
[241:43.02]Report trespass.
[241:43.94]This one?
[241:44.24]Indictment?
[241:45.22]Which one should I get?
[241:46.38]Or the purging stone?
[241:47.96]There's this curse build up and breaks curse.
[241:57.28]Purging stones.
[241:59.90]Get them both?
[242:04.91]3,000 souls, man.
[242:09.71]Get a bunch of homeward bones.
[242:13.70]Was that stupid?
[242:19.48]That might have been dumb, but whatever.
[242:21.02]It's worth it.
[242:22.06]Okay.
[242:35.07]Why do I need that?
[242:37.37]Twelve is not even enough.
[242:39.73]Probably not.
[242:43.59]Level up.
[242:44.09]Okay.
[242:44.75]I want endurance.
[242:46.19]And I want endurance now.
[242:47.66]Do I have any of these?
[242:54.62]I do not.
[242:55.66]Maybe forty purging stones.
[243:05.80]He can't stop staring at his ass.
[243:07.32]I know.
[243:07.62]I didn't make him like that.
[243:09.51]God did.
[243:09.97]Kill.
[243:10.79]No, this guy probably gives me a medicine tube or something.
[243:14.23]He's gonna live.
[243:14.81]Alright.
[243:15.07]So... I can go...
[243:34.18]I'm trying to think of where I can go here.
[243:37.77]What about back this way?
[243:41.25]Is there a place I could go?
[243:42.55]Down at the Undead Parish, right?
[243:44.63]Isn't there another spot to go down?
[243:47.09]Or should I go to the Darkwood now?
[243:49.41]I feel like there was something I missed over here.
[244:06.62]I want to check over here, please.
[244:11.51]I can't open a map.
[244:12.31]Let me just see.
[244:21.99]Because this is Undead Bird.
[244:28.53]Just trying to remember.
[244:29.59]Should I go fight Havel?
[244:32.23]I could right now, right?
[244:33.27]Do you think I'm strong enough to even attack him?
[244:38.58]I want to level up my weapon one more time.
[244:40.71]So I need to go to the blacksmith.
[244:41.77]Where was the blacksmith at?
[244:49.21]The blacksmith was by the dragon over here.
[244:57.07]Hand parry him.
[244:58.49]Where was the blacksmith?
[244:59.31]That's the thing about Dark Souls 1 is I need to memorize all these places.
[245:10.98]Where was it?
[245:12.82]Up here, right?
[245:13.44]Where was it?
[245:16.20]I don't remember.
[245:16.80]No, because this is where the dragon is.
[245:19.81]The dragon's back.
[245:23.57]Should I try?
[245:24.93]I'm going to try cutting his tail off.
[245:27.39]Let me see if I can do it.
[245:32.81]Wait, I've got to kill these guys first.
[245:34.43]Okay.
[245:42.71]You got my ass memorized?
[245:45.83]The souls, yeah, you're right.
[245:47.19]God damn it, you're right.
[246:04.04]Got it!
[246:04.26]Ah!
[246:05.92]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[246:07.60]Get away, get away, get away!
[246:09.14]Get away from me!
[246:09.60]Get away from me!
[246:12.10]Alright, so, how is that weapon?
[246:16.76]He's not gonna blow fire in here, is he?
[246:17.88]Okay, hold on.
[246:25.16]There it is.
[246:26.32]Holy shit!
[246:30.11]What the fuck?
[246:32.45]200!
[246:33.85]What is the... This is just a base of 200.
[246:39.07]No scaling.
[246:50.20]This thing is so quick!
[246:51.30]Holy shit.
[246:54.62]Hold on.
[246:55.14]Is this cheating if I use this?
[247:02.58]Would I be like a total scrub if I used the Drake Sword?
[247:08.75]It's way better for right now.
[247:14.69]Okay.
[247:17.07]Well, I can actually... That's six versus ten.
[247:22.42]Can I put a shield on, too?
[247:25.56]Just to have one?
[247:30.56]You're a scrub either way.
[247:33.04]Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
[247:35.92]Which shield should I use?
[247:38.82]Which is the best for parrying right now?
[247:42.02]The night shield or the spider shield?
[247:49.47]drops off really quickly.
[247:50.40]Well, I'll just, let me try it for now.
[247:54.90]Oops, wrong hand.
[248:00.58]Wrong hand.
[248:01.62]Sorry.
[248:06.31]Okay.
[248:10.09]Hand parry is actually the best, no joke.
[248:21.76]I want to just test this out.
[248:26.88]Okay, yeah, this thing is stupid.
[248:32.37]It's so much faster than the Zuyander, and it does so much more damage.
[248:42.59]Come here.
[248:43.45]I want to see.
[248:43.79]I want to try to... Well, you missed.
[248:51.56]I gotta time that better.
[248:52.46]392, goddamn.
[249:06.04]R2?
[249:06.24]Is the R2 good with this?
[249:11.77]So it's like a big slash?
[249:15.31]Cool.
[249:18.93]Stop fat rolling.
[249:20.31]What makes the game harder?
[249:22.17]Makes it challenge mode.
[249:23.09]Alright, let's, uh, I'm just gonna go over here.
[249:25.21]Wait, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[249:26.29]I didn't even look over here.
[249:27.23]What is this?
[249:28.37]Can I open this door?
[249:31.25]No.
[249:34.46]I tell you, this is challenge mode.
[249:38.74]Two-handed R2.
[249:42.12]What is that?
[249:47.88]That's cheating.
[249:49.34]Okay, you should never have told me that.
[249:57.98]You never should have told me that, because now I understand why this is a good weapon.
[250:10.35]Oh, this is not fair!
[250:11.57]Is there any downside?
[250:14.17]This doesn't cost any mana or anything, right?
[250:18.32]I don't want to die here, but I'm just testing.
[250:19.88]Oh, I'm breaking it.
[250:31.11]I'm breaking the... I've balled around.
[250:32.59]What's that shit?
[250:33.15]Let me see.
[250:33.69]Poise.
[250:33.83]16 versus 12.
[250:34.25]10 versus 7.
[250:47.78]It just breaks the weapon.
[250:48.88]Alright.
[250:49.62]I'll keep that in mind.
[250:52.30]But now... Now... Let him break it.
[250:57.40]Can it be repaired?
[251:04.89]Put on my helmet.
[251:07.75]Give us back the ass.
[251:14.99]Do something.
[251:16.11]I hate when they just don't do something.
[251:19.23]And then, and then I just, I, I, I, I, you know.
[251:27.81]This way.
[251:28.30]And if Blacksmith is getting kind of lost, I'm not going to lie, he's down this way.
[251:34.38]Drake Sword only goes up plus five.
[251:36.86]Can only be upgraded with Twinklin' Titanite.
[251:38.48]Excuse me, Jeremy, excuse me while I die.
[251:49.39]I can't I read them if I want to read chat I need to be in a place where I know I'm not gonna get fucking attacked My eyes is off the goddamn screen Walking forward dragon skips, okay It's you guys wanna like rip off my skin I
[252:22.30]No, don't lose 4,000 souls.
[252:23.30]What a fucking moron.
[252:24.86]I just go in the elevator.
[252:26.62]I... I gotta start... I start Predator Zone tonight to get rid of it.
[252:36.27]I'm bearable.
[252:38.13]I know that feeling.
[252:42.89]Yeah, it sucks.
[252:45.69]Um...
[252:51.70]Does he have the tailback?
[252:52.64]Yeah.
[252:53.48]So I'm trying to... Remember, this is the problem that I had with Dark Souls 1 before.
[252:59.20]I need to pay complete attention to where every single thing is in my mind.
[253:08.11]I like everything.
[253:08.79]There's so many places.
[253:09.69]It's very overwhelming.
[253:12.14]I'm so used to playing a game like Bloodborne where you just go, click this and go here and that's ready to go.
[253:27.97]I'm going to have to take a break here and slather some cortisone on me.
[253:33.57]I need a Dark Souls GPS.
[253:37.71]I really do.
[253:38.21]I'm going to go behind these barrels.
[253:52.33]There's stuff over here.
[254:02.67]I guess there's not anything over here.
[254:05.57]Chats and GPS.
[254:06.33]This is why I need you guys.
[254:09.06]My sense of direction is so poor.
[254:15.20]Alright.
[254:16.18]Just rest here for a second.
[254:17.57]Yeah, I got to go get some hydrocortisone.
[254:19.89]This is driving me crazy.
[254:21.53]I'll be right back.
[254:24.49]BRB.
[256:54.85]I feel a little bit better now.
[257:03.04]Let me get my water.
[257:10.55]Change this back.
[257:15.51]By the way, I hope you guys are having a good day.
[257:18.79]Now, should I... Should... I go human.
[257:25.64]Is there any benefit to being human in this game?
[257:29.90]I don't really remember.
[257:30.70]I know there's benefits in the other ones.
[257:33.30]Wash my hands?
[257:33.96]I did.
[257:35.36]I'm fine.
[257:38.93]Not really.
[257:42.29]Alright, let's do it.
[257:45.81]I thought I had that.
[257:46.41]I really thought I had that one.
[257:51.78]Slow-ass animation.
[257:54.44]Oh, that was like, that was like, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes!
[258:04.04]There we go.
[258:04.74]You're offline will increase item discovery a bit.
[258:06.60]Oh, okay.
[258:08.22]That's really not a big deal.
[258:18.39]You know what?
[258:18.93]Ah, screw it.
[258:20.23]I'm just going to run.
[258:20.81]I'm going to get together.
[258:24.96]Bonfire.
[258:31.56]Yep.
[258:35.42]Go online.
[258:37.92]Am I going to get, like, perma-bans from the game if I go online?
[258:45.30]Bonfire.
[258:46.30]Shit.
[258:46.66]Hold on.
[258:52.79]Is the guy still behind me?
[258:54.77]Probably.
[258:55.91]Why wouldn't he be?
[258:58.51]You got both of the same goddamn move.
[259:00.38]You just did... You did a Chrono Trigger move to me.
[259:06.32]Two of your party members just did the X-Wing.
[259:08.40]Okay, fuck you.
[259:13.02]Oh lord.
[259:13.44]No, you know what?
[259:15.66]Fuck it.
[259:16.14]What do you think?
[259:17.18]Jeremy, please.
[259:18.86]Jeremy, don't.
[259:20.50]Why are you like this right now?
[259:23.05]Go downstairs.
[259:25.31]Don't!
[259:28.12]He's still behind me.
[259:31.80]Touch it.
[259:32.26]Touch it.
[259:32.68]Touch it.
[259:33.06]Okay.
[259:37.46]So, let me level up.
[259:41.57]Let's do... Let's do strength.
[259:46.67]Now, can I do anything down here right now?
[259:56.43]Guiding a blind man through a maze.
[259:58.86]Oh, I'm so itchy.
[260:02.20]Repair equipment.
[260:02.88]Drake sword.
[260:05.16]Yeah, sure.
[260:07.31]Reinforce.
[260:09.53]So, I need a dragon skill.
[260:11.53]Okay.
[260:19.72]Okay.
[260:24.74]That's that way.
[260:26.38]I guess I can't really do anything.
[260:30.66]Yeah, there was a locked door on the dragon bridge, wasn't there?
[260:34.55]Where Mr. Sun Man was, right?
[260:39.15]It's not worth it.
[260:41.29]No, I guess you're right.
[260:42.84]But let me look...
[260:46.84]19 out of 60, so shouldn't I be... No, I'm still fat rolling.
[260:53.57]At this point, just put this other shit on.
[260:59.39]Right?
[260:59.63]Because this makes me 25 to 60, which is fine.
[261:01.43]As long as it's not 30, right?
[261:04.13]Same thing, right?
[261:17.00]Upgrade this way.
[261:21.30]No, I don't want to wear the ass pants right now.
[261:24.92]Not right now.
[261:35.07]I could go find Havel.
[261:36.07]There's just a lot of random things I can do.
[261:38.03]I want to... Let's go back to Firelink for a second.
[261:48.14]Just for a minute.
[261:55.45]Grab this way, Ender.
[261:56.15]I'm going to use the Drake Sword for a little bit.
[262:01.11]I want the 10 Estus Blast.
[262:10.00]It's right here.
[262:10.44]I'm going to just get it.
[262:22.71]Zway Ander.
[262:31.02]Okay.
[262:31.26]Drake's Order has no scaling.
[262:33.56]Well, I won't use it.
[262:35.24]It's not good to be used, you know?
[262:36.97]Alright, back to the elevator.
[262:39.69]Is that the right way?
[262:43.61]Yes.
[262:47.49]No, it's not.
[262:51.02]I miss my gravestones.
[263:07.99]let's go yeah let me just use the drink for a little bit I'm just so I'm so that this again I'm running into the same
[263:22.48]I just don't like running around.
[263:23.36]I really would rather just travel to a place.
[263:27.66]I know that's like, oh, well, you're not experiencing the world, but I mean, very clearly, this is the only game they did this in.
[263:36.87]And everyone would say, well, hey, this is the best one.
[263:40.83]But I do miss just being able to travel around.
[263:45.49]Go to Havel.
[263:47.95]Should I fight Havel now?
[263:52.84]Because, like, I just get so lost so easily, and I don't, like, memorize where I was two hours ago.
[263:59.17]Like, where was, like, the pig?
[264:01.83]It was back here, right?
[264:09.75]Just upgrade it anyways?
[264:10.58]Nah, that's not a bad idea.
[264:17.40]Is there a way I can go back this way to the left?
[264:25.06]trying to like figure out like where to go from here the world feels real yeah I mean I I understand why it's people love it but I personally would rather just go oh you're this is where you got to go next and you you go go there now you have to earn the ability Dark Souls 3 poise wine no I don't I don't I don't care
[264:56.15]I thought the forest wasn't the next area.
[265:02.61]Back to the dragon bridge.
[265:03.69]Alright.
[265:04.01]The dragon bridge was... I got to go back to... I'm just going to run this way.
[265:09.03]Okay.
[265:18.38]I'm just going to get out there.
[265:19.16]I need to get out and just look.
[265:22.80]So, dragon bridge from here.
[265:27.62]And I'll upgrade the sword.
[265:28.60]You know, I am here, you're right.
[265:31.81]Upgrade this waywander.
[265:36.73]You must learn.
[265:41.81]Backtracking isn't fun.
[265:43.81]It just kind of brings me back to the old Resident Evil days, where when I play the old Resident Evils, I'm gonna die.
[265:53.22]fucking guy here there's two they're all here they're all here now okay they're all here I don't know if they're behind me they're right behind me aren't they he's right behind me isn't he when I go back and play Resident Evil one or isn't for instance and you get to that point in the game where you go okay I'm here
[266:22.48]Oh, I gotta go all the way back.
[266:24.72]Shit.
[266:24.90]Just run into the forest.
[266:35.79]Well... Reinforce the... Where is it?
[266:40.63]Sway Hender!
[266:42.41]Sure thing.
[266:42.97]Get it up.
[266:44.49]+2.
[266:47.35]Uh, I don't have enough to do it again.
[266:50.90]Could just go to the forest.
[266:51.64]Yeah, I'm right here.
[266:53.52]I'm gonna do it.
[266:54.14]Let's go this way.
[267:04.65]Let's just take a look over here.
[267:06.93]I could buy more.
[267:07.71]Yeah, the 800 I wouldn't be able to afford to upgrade.
[267:32.20]You know, it's weird.
[267:32.68]I almost feel like... I, um... I want one of those... You know those Dark Souls wiki maps?
[267:41.54]Well, can't do R2 like that anymore.
[267:48.72]Oh, no.
[267:49.34]Is he gonna powerbomb me?
[267:54.86]That did a lot of damage.
[267:55.80]Okay, well, he's gone.
[267:58.22]I shouldn't even parry this guy.
[267:59.42]Just attack him.
[268:00.04]Alright, what about...
[268:03.17]Where is this going to take me?
[268:10.32]This way.
[268:10.92]Tree guy.
[268:12.68]Oh, I forgot.
[268:14.50]Be careful with that thing, dude.
[268:15.82]The reach is a lot smaller on this, though.
[268:28.53]You use those maps while you first play through.
[268:30.71]Just because it's a point of reference, you can just look and be like, wait, okay, that's where I am.
[268:36.50]If I need to start doing that, I will.
[268:39.08]But for now, it's... We're okay.
[268:41.36]We're okay for now.
[268:46.49]Don't use the drake sword.
[268:49.01]Only for a minute.
[268:51.11]What is that?
[268:51.53]There's a big light over here.
[269:01.32]Open.
[269:02.62]Locked by a contraption.
[269:07.04]Wait, isn't there an illusory wall here?
[269:11.27]Can't you go through here?
[269:12.25]Oh my lord in heaven.
[269:37.72]You guys blend in with the environment.
[269:39.02]I don't like you.
[269:39.50]Still got hit.
[269:50.10]Alright.
[269:56.75]Moss clump.
[270:01.61]Where is it?
[270:02.73]I know it's around here somewhere.
[270:19.60]moss clump good old moss clumps um I'm certain that there's a way to get over here there it is good to go I don't really need to rest here yeah I do
[270:48.58]I don't know why I just did that.
[270:49.52]Uh, any more item?
[270:54.84]He looks up secret?
[270:55.78]No, no, I... I, like, know that's there.
[270:59.18]I didn't look it up.
[271:03.45]Oh, shit.
[271:04.25]Alright, well, whatever's through here, we're gonna see what it is.
[271:06.13]Hey, I forget, what is through here?
[271:07.83]Sif?
[271:08.59]Dog?
[271:12.13]No, it's just, it's the area opens up.
[271:13.85]Okay.
[271:15.48]Well, now I have to take care of these guys.
[271:22.52]Oh boy, or I'll die.
[271:24.04]Either one of those two things will happen right now.
[271:29.20]Please.
[271:30.10]Seriously.
[271:30.52]Ay yi yi.
[271:40.58]This is not going so well for me right now.
[271:46.22]I have trouble with these guys because it's weird.
[271:48.36]They don't have a body.
[271:50.01]It's just a bush.
[271:51.29]It's hard for me to...
[271:57.85]What's he doing?
[271:58.35]Backstab?
[272:04.17]What's wrong with me?
[272:07.12]How do I get this off?
[272:12.34]Okay, well... That was fun.
[272:26.65]Now, maybe I won't aggro those three stupid enemies right now.
[272:35.18]Do they come out no matter what?
[272:36.10]No, they don't, do they?
[272:39.40]No.
[272:43.08]Let's go to that three assholes.
[272:46.52]This guy stands up.
[272:54.43]Oh my god, why?
[272:55.69]Why?
[272:56.05]You do it anyways.
[272:57.23]You do it anyways.
[272:57.93]You came out of fucking nowhere.
[273:04.47]Nope.
[273:05.23]Oh, no.
[273:07.37]So you have to kill these fucking things, because they just follow you anyways.
[273:18.09]Or were they in the ground?
[273:19.01]I don't even know where the hell they were.
[273:22.90]They might have just been in front of me and I didn't see them.
[273:33.14]Yeah, it is these.
[273:33.80]Okay.
[273:49.79]Now that's taken care of.
[273:54.26]Let's fight the jolly green giant over here.
[274:02.05]He stands up.
[274:02.65]I can't backstab him, I don't think.
[274:09.78]Greedy, but... Oh, too greedy.
[274:13.20]Trying too hard there.
[274:14.18]Not gonna do that again.
[274:21.86]Okay.
[274:24.87]There's probably more than one of these guys.
[274:26.03]Let's go to the left.
[274:32.83]I don't know what that sound was, but it... Okay, partisan.
[274:36.51]Is this thing alive?
[274:38.44]Oh, there's snakes in the tree.
[274:42.12]Okay.
[274:46.34]Stupid.
[274:46.70]Of course there's a guy that runs behind you.
[274:48.46]Why wouldn't there be?
[274:56.42]Let's hug the left wall.
[275:03.65]We can go back and hug the right wall in case we miss something, but just for shits and giggles, let's see what's over here.
[275:12.27]Crumbled building.
[275:15.05]Snakes.
[275:15.37]They're dead?
[275:19.41]Okay, now it is.
[275:21.35]Is it two enemies or is it one?
[275:23.17]What a weird looking animal.
[275:26.36]That doesn't know what it wants to be.
[275:29.14]That's a gecko lizard snake.
[275:32.59]That's a gecko snake.
[275:34.13]With two heads.
[275:34.71]Alright.
[275:35.85]Over here.
[275:40.27]Items that way.
[275:41.13]Well, this looks like the place... Okay, easy now.
[275:46.96]Oh, shit.
[275:51.62]Don't aggro something else.
[275:52.52]Okay, good.
[276:00.73]I'm so confused right now.
[276:01.92]It doesn't matter where he is?
[276:05.10]What the fuck was that?
[276:09.28]What?
[276:12.06]So even if I go near him, that happens?
[276:14.34]Alright, so it's just an aura.
[276:21.61]If you go near him, that happens.
[276:23.43]So what, I just hold the shield out and just eat it?
[276:27.85]What the fuck?
[276:29.35]God damn it.
[276:33.64]Can I hold the shield out while he does that?
[276:38.79]His moves make you over encumbered, okay.
[276:45.67]Should I be like spamming a button?
[277:04.50]I gotta stop playing this game like Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne.
[277:07.24]I forget, they're completely different fucking video games.
[277:09.69]I don't know why I keep trying to play it like Bloodborne.
[277:16.87]This couldn't be more different than that game.
[277:19.45]If that's burned in my brain, the kind of gameplay that is in that game.
[277:41.62]I'm just gonna... Let me go over here.
[277:45.36]How is Bloodborne different?
[277:46.72]There is no shield.
[277:48.94]That's all you... All you do is dodge in Bloodborne.
[277:51.10]Whoa!
[277:52.30]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[277:57.35]All takes you to the same place.
[278:01.21]Oh my god, fuck the giant.
[278:02.09]Who cares?
[278:03.57]Hopefully they aren't gonna get myself in any trouble over this way.
[278:06.91]Something was down there though.
[278:10.65]Oh my god, they're all here.
[278:13.83]They're all still chasing me.
[278:15.87]What is that?
[278:20.13]Alright, we're going in here.
[278:21.67]The moonlit butterfly.
[278:26.54]Oh, this thing.
[278:29.26]The thing that goes... What's that for?
[278:40.85]Can I fall off the edge?
[278:41.78]I probably could fall off the edge somewhere.
[278:51.52]I gotta be careful.
[278:52.10]Whoa.
[278:54.74]Hello.
[278:55.18]Okay.
[278:55.88]Well, you can do that.
[279:03.85]God damn it.
[279:04.35]How am I supposed to know if it's gonna be that one or the other one?
[279:08.53]Alright, come here.
[279:10.78]Head out.
[279:13.08]Okay.
[279:16.14]Uh... Probably need to... Something I gotta probably do here.
[279:20.32]Is there something in the environment?
[279:21.35]Let's look in the environment.
[279:23.49]Anything in the environment?
[279:26.37]Just use the shield.
[279:36.35]I gotta, like, hit it out of the air?
[279:40.49]Do I need, like, a ranged ability or something?
[279:42.25]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[279:44.95]He's leaning in.
[279:45.49]Okay.
[279:45.83]Alright, you just have to dodge.
[279:50.09]Whoops.
[279:50.70]Well, that does a lot of fucking damage.
[279:52.44]Alright, he does a gigantic explosion.
[280:00.34]Alright, let's just... Let's dodge.
[280:01.70]Let's get it right.
[280:05.18]It shouldn't be too bad.
[280:09.84]Okay, with the shield, this is kind of just brain dead.
[280:22.04]Okay, let me hit you in the face again for free.
[280:30.55]Come on in.
[280:32.51]No?
[280:43.38]I wonder if there's something I can do to make this faster.
[280:45.92]Probably not.
[280:48.02]Coming in.
[280:50.46]Really wish I had more health.
[280:53.76]Now that I know what the hell's going on.
[281:03.01]Here she comes.
[281:07.95]Okay, one more hit and then I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[281:10.69]Okay, nope.
[281:11.25]I can kill it.
[281:12.29]I can kill it, right?
[281:17.09]I can't screw around.
[281:17.73]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[281:20.57]Wait, can I do this?
[281:22.71]Don't fuck around.
[281:23.33]Just get it done.
[281:23.99]Whatever.
[281:27.24]Why am I not dodging?
[281:28.30]Because everybody screamed at me when I dodged at this point.
[281:32.48]I was trying to dodge and then people said, put the shield up.
[281:35.92]And now people are mad that I'm not dodging.
[281:44.30]How would I rate Oatmeal from 0 to 10?
[281:45.78]I gotta stop reading chat, I'm fighting a boss in Dark Souls.
[281:48.28]I could put on a firebomb, but it's a little too late for that.
[282:01.19]Hopefully I can tank this damage until I lay- This- Oh my god, please, like seriously, just land.
[282:08.35]Land for god's sake so I don't- Holy shit.
[282:15.00]Oh, man!
[282:17.88]Oh, my God!
[282:19.18]Oh, my God, this is... Oh, my God, this is so easy.
[282:33.69]Oh, I'm so angry right now.
[282:35.84]I hate this boss.
[282:39.92]I just didn't even have them on the fucking bar, because I... God damn it.
[282:44.73]Give me a break.
[282:45.57]What like, what like a simple boss to lose to?
[282:50.23]That's so painful.
[282:52.67]God damn it, man.
[282:59.47]Fuck, fuck oatmeal.
[283:00.47]Oatmeal sucks.
[283:02.15]It's sludge.
[283:06.37]Why would you eat oatmeal?
[283:07.53]It's like eating somebody spitting into a jar for 12 days.
[283:10.79]And then they mix it up and hand it to you.
[283:22.09]I'm so mad.
[283:23.59]I'm so fucking mad.
[283:24.55]That is so... Oh, fuck this boss.
[283:27.69]This is just a test in patience.
[283:34.24]I just got that armor.
[283:35.24]I just... I can't even think right now.
[283:37.92]I'm too upset.
[283:39.24]I don't even have anything.
[283:44.44]Where are you?
[283:44.98]Come here.
[283:48.85]Can I actually hit this?
[283:54.01]Okay, you can miss.
[283:55.41]You actually can miss with this thing.
[283:57.80]So, just be aware of that, sir.
[284:01.98]Me.
[284:09.01]I hate that I have to do this again.
[284:10.29]But I had it done.
[284:11.51]I needed to hit him one more time.
[284:12.75]I just didn't.
[284:33.13]I gotta capitalize on that.
[284:35.53]When they landed the first time, I didn't know.
[284:37.37]I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
[284:39.39]Come on down and land, please.
[284:47.94]Or you embarrass me again.
[284:52.10]I will not be embarrassed.
[284:56.74]One more time.
[285:04.03]top myself off.
[285:09.83]Thankfully, this boss is fairly easy, though.
[285:11.35]I just need to be patient.
[285:19.62]Are we trying to make a way to make archers feel good with this boss?
[285:25.60]Yeah.
[285:25.98]I probably should be using a different shield.
[285:30.08]I always thought archery was terrible in every one of these games, though.
[285:34.46]Isn't that the case?
[285:35.32]If you use a ranged weapon, it's just not good at all.
[285:44.01]Alright, come on down.
[285:47.27]Do your long one.
[285:49.17]And then I'm going to kill you with a fireball.
[285:54.00]Is he reading chat?
[285:55.10]Yes.
[285:56.10]But that's because I know exactly what to do now.
[286:03.65]Taking a lot of unnecessary hits.
[286:04.83]Alright, can you land?
[286:09.81]I'm so afraid that's gonna hurt me one time.
[286:11.93]Alright, this should be the end right here.
[286:20.92]Oh shit, don't fucking... Okay, we're good.
[286:23.76]Alright, game over.
[286:26.08]I win.
[286:29.58]I missed.
[286:32.50]Come here.
[286:35.05]Okay, I was gonna say if I can't reach.
[286:39.75]So, the moonlit butterfly.
[286:44.47]And a human.
[286:44.93]Imagine being able to fly and only lowering yourself to get hit.
[286:54.18]Well, you gotta rest.
[286:56.26]You know, some animals gotta come up for air sometimes, man.
[287:01.12]Couldn't blame the oatmeal.
[287:02.06]I actually like oatmeal.
[287:03.36]No, I don't.
[287:04.04]Sometimes I do.
[287:05.88]I like oatmeal when it's just barely out of the microwave.
[287:11.91]It has to be within a minute.
[287:20.51]Alright, so now... Where am I going now?
[287:26.68]After oatmeal cools, it turns into this coagulated gross mess.
[287:32.22]It's just boogers.
[287:33.86]It is just somebody just blew their nose and spitting it a thousand times.
[287:37.78]What's this?
[287:44.75]Watchtower basement key.
[287:47.25]And a divine ember.
[287:48.91]And a homeward bone.
[287:52.27]Okay.
[287:53.09]Let's take a look at that one.
[287:55.48]Elite Knight Helm.
[287:57.92]Oh my god.
[288:03.17]Why is this so much better than everything?
[288:08.77]Elite Knight.
[288:12.13]Oh, wait.
[288:15.65]It's so heavy, though.
[288:19.88]Not by very much more.
[288:21.20]I'm still under... I'm still not fat rolling, right?
[288:28.09]Elite Knight Leggings.
[288:28.97]This will put me at... What am I at now?
[288:34.57]35?
[288:34.59]Okay, I'm fat rolling now.
[288:40.92]Which means... What can I take off here?
[288:42.88]6.9.
[288:44.30]I need to... If I put on... These are the pants.
[288:56.24]He's becoming the classic noob build.
[289:00.36]Shield can come off now.
[289:01.26]That's true.
[289:01.93]32, though.
[289:05.93]I really am becoming the Dark Souls character on every IGN review you've ever... On every review site.
[289:12.73]In fact, this is the image that you see.
[289:14.93]Right?
[289:17.73]Here you go.
[289:18.27]Here's your thumbnail for every review site's Dark Souls review.
[289:26.06]Hold on, like... There it is.
[289:28.58]Bang!
[289:30.52]Take that picture.
[289:35.60]So, how do I... How do I make this work?
[289:48.56]I think... Maybe hands?
[289:50.04]1.8.
[289:50.22]What are we at?
[289:50.68]30 exactly.
[289:51.80]Now...
[289:57.80]Keep these on.
[289:58.58]I'm going to have to put the new pants on.
[290:00.76]27 or 28.
[290:00.96]What gives me more poise?
[290:03.46]Doesn't matter.
[290:04.52]These are fine.
[290:07.67]That's better.
[290:09.01]And yes, I'm going to use this for now.
[290:11.23]Because it's the best thing I have for now.
[290:12.61]Doesn't mean I'm going to wear it forever.
[290:16.75]Big poise for big boys.
[290:18.33]Yeah.
[290:21.57]Alright, so I can give that to the blacksmith, right?
[290:33.02]Dark Souls Remastered Jex build.
[290:35.00]No, this is the... This is the preliminary.
[290:37.56]I'm inside the Cocoon build.
[290:41.29]Go fight Havel?
[290:41.95]Okay.
[290:47.07]Sounds like a plan.
[290:51.57]Can I get there from here?
[290:57.91]I probably should just teleport out of here, huh?
[290:59.93]No, that's gonna... Oh, shit.
[291:05.05]Teleporting out of here takes me to... Yeah, I'm not fucking around.
[291:15.74]I'm not screwing around here.
[291:19.50]I know I'll get killed there.
[291:20.70]I will.
[291:23.64]You all know it's possible.
[291:24.54]It'll happen.
[291:29.89]Okay, where's the equipment load?
[291:31.49]It's endurance, right?
[291:36.30]I kind of can do three points.
[291:42.13]I'm going to say 18 vitality and two in endurance just to get the equipment load up.
[291:55.44]Actually, that looks alright.
[291:56.76]Yeah.
[291:56.98]24 strength, 18 vitality.
[291:57.66]I'm going to do 20, 20, and then 25 vitality.
[292:11.12]18 fatality.
[292:11.78]8 IQ.
[292:17.21]So, where... Let's see.
[292:20.21]Hold on a second.
[292:27.12]I can now one-hander this weapon.
[292:35.55]We can use the big boy sword now.
[292:41.58]Alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[292:43.46]I can't do anything about this, right?
[292:47.65]Contraption there, okay.
[292:50.97]Parry's on the fly, that's right.
[292:53.07]Well, now at least I have a gauntlet to do it with.
[292:58.75]The shortcut.
[293:03.04]Um, okay, where the fuck am I going?
[293:11.09]I missed.
[293:12.19]But at least it scared him.
[293:14.87]This thing is so good.
[293:18.61]How do I get up there?
[293:22.90]Still alive?
[293:32.90]I'm getting a lot of this moss, which is good.
[293:35.52]Is he on me?
[293:37.18]Down here?
[293:39.96]Is that tree alive?
[293:42.35]Is there an alive tree, boss?
[293:43.57]Let me take a look.
[293:48.87]I have to fall off.
[293:58.50]Yes, that is an actual boss.
[294:03.68]Well, maybe eventually I'll see him.
[294:10.61]Dammit, not close enough.
[294:14.77]Big reach, dude.
[294:16.96]Come on.
[294:17.42]Alright, so it was up here, right?
[294:26.24]This was the other way I could go.
[294:28.96]This takes me around this way.
[294:32.88]Down there.
[294:34.57]Hold on.
[294:43.44]Dude.
[294:43.94]Come on, dude.
[294:47.88]Oh, the cookie bug is here again, right?
[294:49.55]Okay, don't screw this up.
[294:51.13]Okay, cookie bug.
[295:07.89]I swung over it.
[295:29.46]Quit and reload no, I'll get it out eventually before the game ends.
[295:33.09]I'll get that Left or right.
[295:37.97]Let's go this way first.
[295:38.67]Oh
[295:43.35]Go down this way.
[295:46.70]What happened to me here?
[295:52.82]Did I get scared and turn around?
[295:56.14]Why did I not keep going down this way?
[296:01.92]Oh, that's why.
[296:03.16]That's why.
[296:04.62]Alright.
[296:07.80]Let's do it.
[296:08.22]He's got the fucking spear, though.
[296:32.29]Fucking asshole I'm fucking rolling around like a fat ass He's right behind me
[296:49.09]Damn it.
[296:50.13]Oh my god He's too fast he's too fast for me he has extra points Get cheesed asshole Trying to be a hero
[297:13.98]Oh my god, I'm gonna lose.
[297:17.42]Gotta get it.
[297:17.86]Gotta get it!
[297:20.16]Get the fuck outta here!
[297:29.01]Okay.
[297:36.10]I don't roll off the cliff.
[297:46.52]So I think my heart stopped right there.
[297:53.12]When he swung down, I don't think I was breathing.
[297:56.59]Okay, hold on.
[297:57.89]There's a little spot here.
[298:04.91]Grass Crest Shield.
[298:07.25]Cool.
[298:13.92]In a bonfire.
[298:15.84]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[298:21.84]Which will take me backwards this way.
[298:29.65]Not enough to level up anything.
[298:31.65]Let me look at that shield.
[298:36.33]Grass Crest Shield.
[298:37.83]Probably at the very bottom, right?
[298:40.29]Okay, why is this so... What's this?
[298:41.53]What's this?
[298:44.95]Old medium metal shield of unknown origin.
[298:47.03]The grass crest is lightly imbued with magic, which slightly speeds stamina recovery.
[298:59.00]I gotta... I'm fat rolling now.
[299:04.39]Wasn't I not before?
[299:05.25]Okay, I gotta put these gauntlets on.
[299:10.61]That's better.
[299:12.85]Alright, let's go.
[299:23.00]And that... Looks like an elevator!
[299:27.35]Even if it's on your back, it'll give you a regen.
[299:30.83]Wouldn't that... That's gonna slow me down, right?
[299:33.41]So just put it on and... Compensate?
[299:39.37]Okay, so now I have a weight.
[299:41.45]32?
[299:41.49]How are these way more?
[299:50.66]Okay, I can put on the hood.
[299:54.74]Okay, that's better.
[299:59.08]Not bad rolling, right?
[299:59.96]Nope.
[300:01.89]Let's go.
[300:04.99]Do I just get permanent stamina regen?
[300:06.27]I feel like I missed something right there.
[300:20.24]Hold on.
[300:20.66]Let's see.
[300:22.08]Was there a little spot for me to jump over there?
[300:28.28]Was there?
[300:28.98]Usually there is.
[300:29.62]A random little thing.
[300:31.18]I might be going crazy.
[300:32.62]Let's see.
[300:42.99]Guess not.
[300:45.27]I thought I saw something.
[300:49.41]Oh well.
[300:49.85]Okay.
[300:56.80]Where the hell am I?
[301:01.06]Where... what is this?
[301:08.16]Okay, Valley of the Drakes again.
[301:10.21]Raise it around this rickle.
[301:24.94]I'm not really hurting these guys, am I?
[301:29.89]Let me spray it.
[301:38.95]I don't want to get too close to the edge when I'm back here.
[301:45.80]Holy fuck!
[301:56.36]come back here slowly but surely I know I'm not really supposed to be fighting these things right now but
[302:26.85]One more.
[302:33.63]Thousand souls for killing one of these.
[302:36.57]Damn.
[302:36.95]Alright, so if I can go up that way, what is up there?
[302:42.79]Definitely cannot take, like, two or three of these guys at the same time.
[302:49.50]So, I'm just gonna say, I'm gonna go this way, just to look.
[302:57.61]Oh man, oh man, okay.
[302:58.91]So, yeah.
[303:06.65]Looks like we're gonna have to do it one at a time.
[303:28.79]Am I interested in Litecoin donations?
[303:31.77]Um... I think, didn't they just put in some... Oh, that hurts a lot.
[303:38.35]Oh man, that hurts a lot.
[303:39.78]Dude, it hurts a lot.
[303:42.64]Oh boy, oh boy, I'm not prepared for this.
[303:44.78]I'm getting sandwiched.
[303:49.04]I'm gonna run by this guy.
[303:51.41]Can I fit?
[303:52.89]Can I fit by you?
[304:09.22]I am unstoppable what do you think you're dealing with here come here boy you're dealing with a man a true man is this alive soul of a proud knight is this thing alive is this thing alive is the Super Mario bones guy gonna get up and attack me
[304:52.15]At least I got all the stuff.
[304:56.86]What did I just get?
[304:57.60]I got one of these already.
[305:01.76]What was that weapon?
[305:06.77]Astoria's straight sword.
[305:09.73]It's magic.
[305:10.33]It scales with magic shit.
[305:14.97]Okay, well that was cool.
[305:17.57]Technically it wasn't alive, it was undead.
[305:19.44]Alright, so I... I'm gonna just... I'm... I guess I'm just gonna try to get by those things.
[305:31.26]Oh, you didn't... Sorry, you didn't finish what we were talking about, Lightcoin.
[305:33.77]Um, apparently... Streamlabs has implemented...
[305:38.73]A way for them to show up on screen.
[305:41.21]You actually connect... I connect a Coinbase account.
[305:46.09]Which is an app.
[305:46.65]I'm sure you're probably aware of that at this point.
[305:50.51]So I can eventually... I will have a... I think it's BTC.
[305:55.87]Ethereum.
[305:57.17]BCH.
[305:57.71]And Litecoin.
[305:59.71]And it'll show up on the screen.
[306:00.71]And it'll... Hey!
[306:01.67]Streamlabs support.
[306:03.73]But at this very moment, I don't.
[306:07.18]I just have my random ethereum address so I'm I'm gonna should I I'm gonna run by I'm just gonna run to the left here or are not oh man I just lost four thousand I need well now I'm gonna try to run straight off the bridge
[306:38.87]Fuck, I gotta step on this every time.
[306:48.65]4k souls is nothing.
[306:49.55]No, it's not.
[306:51.19]Dodging right, dodges left.
[306:53.84]Undodges left.
[306:55.44]I didn't get hit one time that first time.
[306:59.02]But, you know.
[307:01.18]At this point, I'm just trying to get away from them.
[307:03.26]Because I can't really reliably fight them.
[307:10.33]Okay, I stepped on it right.
[307:11.13]Alright.
[307:12.51]Alright.
[307:14.77]Let's go.
[307:18.71]Just see if I can get across the bridge.
[307:19.93]This is gonna be tough.
[307:25.12]And there's an item there and they want me to grab it so bad.
[307:32.34]Get off the screen!
[307:36.66]There are so many lightning dragons.
[307:39.52]Can I open this door?
[307:40.68]Is this a door?
[307:43.34]Oh man, there's a ladder.
[307:45.22]There's a ladder.
[307:48.99]There's shock in the ladder.
[307:50.29]It goes up the whole ladder.
[307:53.15]I made it.
[307:55.27]At least they're realistic about it.
[308:03.76]Tearstone ring.
[308:04.56]Just drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.
[308:07.32]What is this?
[308:10.22]That did nothing for me.
[308:17.24]Can I, like, slash this or something?
[308:20.84]Doesn't the red tearstone do boost attack while your HP is low?
[308:29.54]Doesn't everybody get this in...
[308:32.43]It's a speedrun ring.
[308:34.15]Homeward bone, but there's nothing... I gotta go that way, huh?
[308:41.91]Because this doesn't open.
[308:42.81]Is there a thing I can pull?
[308:43.91]Put it on.
[308:55.88]Use plunging attack?
[308:56.74]Isn't that gonna kill me?
[309:09.02]Now I want to try to get past that undead dragon.
[309:16.30]I couldn't get out of that.
[309:17.04]What was I supposed to do?
[309:18.00]Homeward bone back to here, but what?
[309:19.48]I'm going to lose no souls.
[309:25.18]I want to try to get by the undead dragon.
[309:31.54]I waited too long.
[309:36.37]Plunging attack should be, for as long as you fall, it increases your damage every 30 feet by 100%.
[309:46.67]Alright, this is going to be hard.
[309:48.76]There you go.
[309:54.36]Alright, I'm going to bait it over this way.
[309:57.54]I'm going to make sure I have full stamina here.
[309:59.36]Bait the electricity.
[310:01.08]Left.
[310:02.54]Or around his back.
[310:05.39]All the way up.
[310:06.25]And just don't disturb the dragon.
[310:07.48]Just get by him.
[310:15.58]He's just awake.
[310:17.37]No, he's just awake now.
[310:19.09]Why are you just awake now?
[310:49.82]What?
[310:52.97]Stop attacking.
[310:53.87]Just go buy him.
[310:55.43]Go buy him.
[310:55.91]Go buy him.
[310:56.35]Go buy him.
[310:56.81]Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.
[311:24.14]That thing is insane.
[311:25.82]Seriously.
[311:28.40]Alright.
[311:29.02]I've made it.
[311:30.63]This is the Valley of the Drakes.
[311:31.85]This is where he is.
[311:32.59]He's right here.
[311:33.25]But I've got to kill him, too.
[311:34.45]That's the thing.
[311:35.51]What about that?
[311:36.27]I've got to go that way.
[311:37.23]No, I don't.
[311:42.59]I remember this.
[311:43.15]You go all the way back around.
[311:44.15]I'm going to have to fight Havel here.
[311:50.26]What is this?
[311:51.90]Is this Blighttown?
[311:53.78]This is Blighttown.
[311:57.32]I remember this shit.
[311:59.41]This is the Blighttown way.
[312:00.53]No, I'm not going that way right now.
[312:16.24]So I can't die here.
[312:19.26]I'm going to be so screwed if I die here.
[312:22.70]Hey, come on, Hebel.
[312:24.72]Don't kill me.
[312:25.20]This brings me here, right?
[312:31.34]It's right here.
[312:35.25]Alright, let's try.
[312:39.15]Did I kill the gargoyles yet?
[312:41.67]I killed the gargoyles already.
[312:43.71]That's not Blighttown?
[312:44.61]What are you talking about?
[312:50.49]I forget where he is.
[312:51.21]No, he's where the gargoyles were.
[312:54.26]No, where the Taurus Demon was.
[313:03.15]Where the hell am I going?
[313:06.77]No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[313:08.61]This goes back up to where the blacksmith is.
[313:12.04]Or not.
[313:15.08]I can't.
[313:15.60]I can't do it.
[313:17.48]Look, I can't memorize the whole world.
[313:19.44]Okay?
[313:19.62]I'm sorry.
[313:20.55]I can't do it.
[313:22.97]This is... This is the Firelink Shrine.
[313:26.65]No.
[313:27.05]God damn it.
[313:30.17]I'm so lost.
[313:31.55]No.
[313:32.52]No.
[313:45.68]Does this guy have anything new to say?
[313:46.80]I need to go back to... I want to go back to the door where the dragon was.
[313:52.82]Which means I have to go back to the undead bird.
[313:57.59]Let's just do this.
[314:03.40]I have to close my eyes and put my fingers on my eyes and just sit here and think of where that was.
[314:07.90]That was right before the tourist demon.
[314:09.29]Okay, I know where it is.
[314:10.49]I just closed my eyes and then I saw it in my head.
[314:12.31]It's over here.
[314:13.15]I almost just fell off.
[314:41.77]Yeah, sometimes you have to close your eyes and put your fingers on your eyes.
[314:45.23]I know where he is.
[314:55.52]No death skips?
[314:56.96]I don't even know how to do those.
[314:58.70]Do you think I'm capable of a death skip?
[315:02.60]I'm just remembering the very beginning of the game and how I ran over this way.
[315:07.66]He's over here.
[315:08.36]Alright, I get this spawn fire.
[315:20.15]Mm-hmm.
[315:22.05]We're good.
[315:24.07]This way, and he's down the... Yes.
[315:28.71]Can I open this?
[315:29.69]Can I open this?
[315:32.03]No.
[315:37.78]It's down there, I wonder.
[315:41.34]This way, around the corner...
[315:48.43]So, can I actually take him?
[315:50.25]I'm gonna fucking die.
[315:55.82]I just solidified my fate.
[315:57.10]I just have to do this.
[316:00.36]Like, three times.
[316:01.06]Oh my god, that felt so good.
[316:04.08]Everything about- I live for that, what just happened.
[316:18.38]Here we go.
[316:19.40]He's down this way.
[316:20.62]He's down.
[316:22.72]Open that door.
[316:23.44]Alright, Havel.
[316:25.48]Can I parry his gigantic turkey club?
[316:29.38]Or should I just move around and outsmart him?
[316:33.63]I feel like I can't parry that because it's too big.
[316:41.41]I need to see what the moves are first, though.
[316:42.87]We're going to fight him in the octagon up there.
[316:49.03]Okay, let's go.
[316:50.13]I need to see what he does when he moves.
[316:55.05]Okay.
[316:55.71]Well, that didn't get parried.
[317:12.03]Oh, man.
[317:14.67]Well, here we go again.
[317:19.47]There, you saw everything.
[317:22.06]I'm going to have to just dance around him.
[317:23.76]I can't.
[317:25.78]Sometimes my parries are okay, and other times I shouldn't even press left trigger under any circumstance.
[317:37.20]He just turned me to dust.
[317:42.60]Let's try this again.
[317:43.42]Let's see if I can hurt him.
[317:51.29]I want to equip all armor because it doesn't matter.
[317:53.03]It probably just died right there.
[317:59.38]I would have been so angry.
[318:03.60]Let me just dance around and see what happens.
[318:23.28]There's a big overhead swing.
[318:28.13]No backstab, though.
[318:34.61]Hmm.
[318:35.31]Okay.
[318:36.37]Why did I do that?
[318:36.95]You idiot.
[318:37.43]This is going to take all day.
[319:04.22]Holy shit.
[319:07.38]Well, that staggered him a little.
[319:12.10]Holy fuck me.
[319:15.48]I gotta get him to do something again.
[319:16.82]I almost feel like I'd rather have a faster...
[319:34.74]I don't know what just happened there.
[319:35.58]I thought I did a visceral attack in Bloodborne.
[319:47.50]God damn it!
[319:52.58]No!
[319:55.66]Why did I try to swing twice?
[319:57.62]Oh my god, you fucking idiot.
[320:02.77]It was the stupid, it was the stupid visceral attack wrong video game.
[320:07.04]It was the wrong video game that made me just do that.
[320:11.42]Wrong game.
[320:14.34]Oh, I'm gonna go up and press R. No, it didn't work.
[320:16.04]It just threw me off.
[320:16.72]And I was... Pain in the ass.
[320:21.56]Parry it.
[320:22.22]I really might as well just go up and try to parry it.
[320:24.08]If I don't parry it, I die anyways.
[320:25.50]So we can save, like... I'm just naked.
[320:28.74]Okay.
[320:32.17]Honestly, it's like a 15-second run.
[320:34.51]Just go parry over and over again, and if you die, it's over.
[320:37.11]You were gonna die anyways instead of dancing around for 15 minutes.
[320:39.29]We're just gonna try to parry him.
[320:44.19]I'm not gonna try to parry the two-handed club.
[320:49.61]Wrong game, but same game.
[320:52.73]I'll get- I gotta just get the parry.
[321:03.79]That's the one I gotta parry.
[321:06.07]No, you asshole.
[321:07.61]No, you two assholes.
[321:09.79]Can he kill them?
[321:10.91]Oh my god.
[321:11.69]Why do you have to follow me down here?
[321:14.33]Why?
[321:14.55]Oh my god.
[321:16.22]I fucking hate that shit.
[321:26.42]Go away.
[321:27.34]Go the fuck away, man.
[321:28.86]Like, I don't want to fight you.
[321:31.63]You don't have to chase me through the whole game.
[321:33.77]Just run a- You don't have to follow me all the way through the whole video game.
[321:51.11]They came all the way down the stairs.
[321:52.31]They were chasing me the whole time.
[321:53.57]And you know what?
[321:54.11]Just deal with it because they're here and they're not going to leave me alone.
[322:02.38]I'm mad?
[322:02.98]Of course I am.
[322:05.12]I'm infuriated.
[322:09.04]Any more?
[322:09.46]Oh yeah, come on up.
[322:10.72]Why don't you follow me?
[322:11.91]Get in here, all of you.
[322:12.93]Is that it?
[322:21.07]Okay, now let me go die trying to parry.
[322:32.47]I'm gonna get it right now.
[322:34.03]He does a big long... I'll get it.
[322:37.09]Just don't do the two handed smash first.
[322:44.87]Here we go.
[322:51.24]He did the two handed smash first.
[323:01.34]Get outta here, come on!
[323:05.56]Oh my god, I have to do that like five times.
[323:10.67]No, fu- hold on.
[323:14.61]I'm not even sure that's worth doing.
[323:19.13]Oh, you fuckin' asshole.
[323:39.14]Ugh.
[324:16.57]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[324:18.59]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[324:28.72]I want to fight you down here.
[324:29.42]I want to fight you back there.
[324:30.24]God damn it, man.
[324:35.12]I was doing so well.
[324:36.57]I was doing so well.
[324:39.21]He's almost dead.
[324:54.68]I win.
[324:54.94]Okay.
[324:55.80]Wow.
[325:00.10]That's too nerve-wracking.
[325:00.94]This game's too hard.
[325:05.47]Alright.
[325:09.15]Here's the basement key.
[325:14.46]What should I take off?
[325:17.80]Boost maximum equipment load.
[325:19.22]There it is.
[325:21.26]It's too hard.
[325:21.98]Let's put my stuff back on.
[325:23.76]Now can I put all this on?
[325:26.32]Can I put on the game review set?
[325:31.28]39... Oh, man.
[325:32.02]Yes, I can.
[325:35.08]Okay.
[325:36.92]Maybe I should just... I'm gonna look down here.
[325:39.34]What's down here?
[325:40.35]Okay, this is Darkroot Basin.
[325:41.59]This is where I was.
[325:42.29]I have the noob build.
[325:47.15]Okay.
[325:49.37]Temporarily.
[325:50.27]Only temporarily.
[325:51.11]Not permanently.
[325:57.27]This is just to, like, get me my feet wet.
[326:00.77]I told you.
[326:01.09]Look at the title of the stream.
[326:03.26]This is just dangling my toes into the baby pool.
[326:07.84]That's it.
[326:09.84]We can figure out some of this other stuff.
[326:12.36]What is this?
[326:12.86]Okay, hold on.
[326:15.30]Items.
[326:19.01]this to me is crystal monsters what about over here just don't want to miss anything I think this is where the dragon is if I keep going this way
[326:44.61]Eventually I'll run into... Okay, so this is when I... If this is going left... Okay, I understand.
[326:52.31]I'm gonna go back.

[327:03.60]Thank you.
[327:04.04]About 32 Nixons.
[327:06.96]Richard Nixons.
[327:08.91]For the $100.
[327:09.49]100.
[327:09.51]You guys have been giving a lot of money tonight.
[327:16.26]Jesus.
[327:17.50]Thank you.
[327:20.83]But thank you, About32Nixxons.
[327:23.15]Thanks for helping me get through a Father's Day without my daughter.
[327:26.55]You're a truly amazing person and definitely just handsome enough to be on the couch for the Smash Ultimate ad.
[327:35.76]Thank you so much, 32Nixxons.
[327:40.74]I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
[327:43.96]Happy Father's Day.
[327:49.08]Hope you're doing well.
[327:52.34]I can't even possibly imagine something like that.
[327:58.24]But much love to you.
[328:05.51]Thank you for telling me that I'm a handsome man, handsome boy.
[328:11.54]Thank you.
[328:17.29]Glad we're seeing lots of love in the chat here.
[328:18.65]That makes me happy.
[328:25.26]Peace and love, that's for sure.
[328:39.05]I'm very handsome.
[328:40.51]I don't know if I am.
[328:42.13]What happened to...
[328:53.61]Did my controller lose again?
[328:54.65]I can't move.
[329:05.92]God damn it.
[329:06.34]Don't do this to me again, game.
[329:16.46]Oh, no.
[329:16.92]I'm stupid.
[329:17.46]It's because I wasn't fully tapped.
[329:19.13]Well, I just tried to go back in.
[329:23.43]There we go.
[329:24.21]It's on keyboard.
[329:25.13]You can see the dumb little mouse on the screen.
[329:29.97]Now let's go see the crystal people.
[329:43.00]No backstabs available?
[329:44.18]No backstab available?
[329:48.88]Still alive.
[329:56.20]They give a lot of souls, too.
[329:59.95]What was that?
[330:02.99]What the hell is that thing?
[330:03.95]Oh, wait a minute.
[330:04.65]Hold on.
[330:05.01]There's a monster here.
[330:06.47]Is there a bonfire somewhere around here that I need to know about?
[330:09.01]There's a monster over there.
[330:09.99]There's a monster over there, and it's shooting at me.
[330:19.14]It's still shooting at me, and I can feel the bullets.
[330:33.52]Alright, what?
[330:34.16]At least he can hurt this guy.
[330:35.35]I don't have any Estus Flasks.
[330:36.41]I'm not sure I want to do this right now.
[330:46.47]Fuck.
[330:47.47]I'm, like, trying to peek over his shoulder.
[330:49.21]Alright, so... I feel like... So if I go down... Hold on.
[331:00.76]Itchy.
[331:01.08]Again, hydrocortisones were enough.
[331:05.51]Is there a bonfire that I'm not seeing?
[331:07.01]Go up here, maybe?
[331:13.25]Ooh, there's something here.
[331:13.95]Wait, is this where I came from?
[331:16.69]This is where I came from.
[331:19.69]Okay, this is where I killed Havel.
[331:25.67]I don't have any healing.
[331:26.95]This is a bad idea.
[331:29.67]I think I'm gonna bone out of here and then come back.
[331:34.28]he forgot already what if I go over here yeah you can tell it's been like another couple hours because the the hydrocortisone wore off sense of direction mine is too it's awful it is so bad phone I didn't look all the way over here though let me just see what's up here just use my humanity
[332:04.16]I've already been to the bonfire near here.
[332:06.16]Where is it?
[332:06.50]It's like right up here or something, right?
[332:08.04]Am I out of my mind?
[332:11.10]Where am I going?
[332:18.76]Not this time.
[332:24.44]Not this time.
[332:25.70]He still got it.
[332:26.36]Alright, so this brings me up here.
[332:32.38]I'm going to bone out.
[332:35.46]I'm gonna bone out of here and just rekindle my brain.
[332:38.89]Acquire many souls.
[332:42.07]Alright, so soul of the Moonlight Butterfly.
[332:43.77]Should I just break this down into souls?
[332:51.30]I have a lot of souls here.
[332:52.08]Yeah, I'm boning out.
[333:00.64]The Black Knight was there?
[333:01.68]I killed the Black Knight.
[333:06.58]There's a cave right under me.
[333:07.65]Well, I'm stupid.
[333:09.25]Let me use my things here.
[333:13.19]Just crush it.
[333:13.83]The weapon's not part of my build or anything.
[333:15.58]2,000?
[333:15.60]1,000? 1,000?
[333:25.92]What's the story with the poison ivy?
[333:29.88]I don't know what happened.
[333:31.74]I took Otto out for a walk to the same place where I take him every time.
[333:36.24]And I don't know.
[333:39.18]I'm covered in poison ivy.
[333:42.40]I don't know.
[333:42.68]It might not be poison ivy.
[333:44.47]Some people in my family looked at it and they were like, well, you might have shingles.
[333:51.17]Which it could be.
[333:53.33]I went to the doctor and they didn't know what it was.
[333:57.26]The doctor was like, uh, I don't know what this is.
[333:59.19]Two doctors had to come in.
[334:00.97]They were like, doc, can you come look at this?
[334:02.87]Two doctors were like looking at my rash and they couldn't figure out what it was.
[334:06.71]So they just gave me prednisone to take for a week and a half.
[334:10.95]And that's it.
[334:13.39]I had chicken pox when I was a kid, yeah.
[334:20.26]I haven't taken a shower in a month.
[334:22.06]Oh my god, I would throw up.
[334:26.55]That stupid floating car decoration was only worth that much.
[334:37.03]Uh, okay.
[334:37.81]Vitality 20.
[334:38.62]That's what I wanted to do.
[334:43.28]So, I could go that way.
[334:46.44]Towards the crystal snake man.
[334:51.02]Or I could... I want to go to... Let's go to the dragon, right?
[334:53.10]Okay.
[334:54.82]The door where the dragon is.
[334:57.91]It's up here, right?
[335:08.79]This takes me up to the dragon.
[335:10.49]He ain't even here anymore.
[335:13.45]There he is.
[335:13.86]I can't believe that hit me.
[335:18.88]Uh, it's in this way.
[335:19.94]Ha ha!
[335:24.57]That's still hitting.
[335:26.38]Why are you doing this to me, Lord?
[335:27.42]I just have to use two of those.
[335:33.80]Is that going to go all the way down the bridge?
[335:36.62]I can feel the wave.
[335:37.98]Yep.
[335:41.36]It's alright.
[335:42.64]I made it.
[335:42.98]It's alright.
[335:45.78]There's this way, and then there's this way.
[335:47.90]Use the basement key.
[335:56.80]Here we go.
[336:04.95]I think I remember this part.
[336:17.47]I'm pretty sure I went right to this.
[336:20.31]Right after beating the gargoyles, I came right down here.
[336:25.86]This is the boss that's in a house, right?
[336:29.08]Oh, and look at that.
[336:30.18]Isn't that something?
[336:33.82]Don't make me die here.
[336:35.30]I want the bonfire right here.
[336:39.85]Everything's connected.
[336:51.16]It's all connected.
[336:58.09]I'm probably... After we explore down here for a little bit, I'm probably going to... It's getting late.
[337:11.16]It's about 12.30 right now.
[337:12.42]I've been streaming for just about six hours.
[337:17.84]I'm loving it.
[337:18.86]It's a blast.
[337:20.52]It's very fun.
[337:26.37]So it's too big for my body?
[337:27.33]I want a bigger one.
[337:28.61]Where do I get a bigger sword?
[337:29.55]And yes, I am going to die to a boss three or four times and fall off that.
[337:38.10]Falling it now.
[337:41.76]You're going to follow me all the way down, aren't you?
[337:45.18]Nothing else, right?
[337:46.70]Okay.
[337:54.87]Missed that one.
[337:56.26]Dummy.
[338:04.77]Dogs.
[338:07.31]Poison dogs.
[338:09.65]At that.
[338:15.86]Okay.
[338:18.60]Fire.
[338:19.34]What about around the corner?
[338:21.14]Nothing.
[338:22.42]Nothing in there.
[338:25.20]More dogs.
[338:34.21]Back this way, or... This way.
[338:43.93]Got trapped.
[338:46.70]Do I have a key for this?
[338:49.02]Residence key!
[338:49.70]Hey, look at that!
[339:04.06]Uh, hi.
[339:05.24]Don't come with a swing.
[339:07.04]Sorcery teacher?
[339:08.06]Well, do you have any money?
[339:11.19]Guys, why would I do that?
[339:12.03]Does he drop something?
[339:33.52]I will rest a while at my sorcery.
[339:36.76]And I will, besides, I have an important... No.
[339:39.90]I ain't rolling into barrels.
[339:40.90]I can't.
[339:41.86]I'm too scared.
[339:44.26]I'm not going to roll around.
[339:45.16]I don't know what that's going to do.
[339:50.14]He sells stuff.
[339:50.88]No, let him live.
[339:51.72]I ain't doing that.
[339:52.38]Is that it?
[340:03.11]Oh my god, that's too much fire.
[340:19.99]It's literally never a problem to roll into barrels.
[340:22.61]Well, that's your opinion.
[340:25.52]And I respect your opinion.
[340:27.70]But I have a different opinion.
[340:29.34]And that is, I don't want to roll into the barrels.
[340:32.76]But I do want this item.
[340:34.82]Surrounded by these psychos.
[340:37.94]I could have known that was going to happen.
[340:39.32]They all were queued up to do the same move.
[340:42.69]Twin humanities.
[340:43.37]I haven't been a human this entire game.
[340:45.77]I feel like I need to do that at some point.
[340:51.59]Dead end.
[340:53.55]Sure thing.
[340:53.97]Okay.
[340:57.12]Can you get an opinion that isn't wrong?
[341:01.99]There's no such thing as a wrong opinion.
[341:04.05]Well, I mean, there is.
[341:04.83]Yeah, there is.
[341:11.44]You can have an opinion.
[341:12.52]You can think my opinion's wrong.
[341:15.20]I can also think your opinion's wrong.
[341:18.86]But, you know, at the end of the day, we're all here.
[341:23.18]I can't break this.
[341:31.09]Isn't the fucking Kappa demon in here somewhere?
[341:34.86]He's in one of these houses.
[341:35.80]He's sitting there eating dinner.
[341:38.88]I can see that guy's feet.
[341:42.42]I can see you through there, man.
[341:51.11]You think you can fucking do that to me?
[341:53.05]Was that an NPC?
[342:07.27]Are these friendlies?
[342:08.17]No, they're not.
[342:12.49]Are they?
[342:22.47]Oh, shit.
[342:22.79]He was a friendly.
[342:24.25]No, he wasn't.
[342:25.67]Mail breaker.
[342:26.35]Are they going to cut my throat?
[342:38.57]Okay, so they come out of the yeah, they come out of the doors anybody else secret windows sorry Johnny Depp Where did he come from?
[342:55.21]Oh that door right there Okay
[343:09.06]watch out this dead bird dead bird I'm looking ah fuck dogs
[343:39.86]God damn it, dude.
[343:42.60]God damn it.
[343:46.40]Oh my... He just parried me.
[343:48.82]You fucking dick.
[343:52.03]And I'm gonna die.
[343:52.75]I'm gonna die from the beast within, whatever it's called.
[343:55.77]I'm thinking Bloodborne, where if it fills up, you become a beast.
[344:06.13]Alright.
[344:08.06]The dog parried me?
[344:10.24]No, that would be something.
[344:16.68]That wasn't for anything.
[344:17.50]There's something in here.
[344:25.71]I hate these little corridors.
[344:27.07]They just stuff you in here.
[344:30.15]Well, yeah, this is the... You fight this guy in a tiny little place, what I remember.
[344:36.22]I have one Estus Blast.
[344:37.34]This ain't going to end well.
[344:40.70]Target shield.
[344:41.40]There's that parry shield we were talking about.
[344:47.14]Anybody else?
[344:50.63]Alright, let's try to first try this guy without any heals.
[344:55.13]Wait, what?
[345:17.36]Okay, well.
[345:29.79]Well, dog!
[345:33.37]If I had some health, I may have been able to do it.
[345:37.75]No, man, I still might be able to do it.
[345:52.92]Wish I had health.
[345:56.56]Yeah, I... So... I know how to kill this guy.
[346:03.20]If I had... If I didn't have one Estus Blast there.
[346:07.88]You just can drop down on him over and over again.
[346:14.71]You can drop down on him over and over again.
[346:16.29]You're just going to kill the two stupid dogs.
[346:25.87]I told you one of these times I was going to do it.
[346:44.20]I'm going to take a break here soon.
[346:46.64]There really is only so much of these kind of games that I can play in one sitting before it all starts to blend together.
[346:53.04]I'm having a blast though with this game.
[346:54.14]This is great.
[347:05.62]I have the entire game trained on me right now.
[347:16.31]Oh my God.
[347:16.97]I didn't even know you were there, man.
[347:26.15]Oh man.
[347:27.65]Oh God.
[347:31.00]Okay.
[347:31.86]Alright.
[347:32.30]So thanks for coming out to the stream, everybody.
[347:35.57]I can't go anywhere.
[347:40.41]All four corners.
[347:43.02]All four corners.
[347:43.92]Oh well.
[347:49.44]No, I want to get the shortcut.
[347:51.46]It's down there.
[347:52.14]Just give it to me.
[347:57.93]Didn't swing.
[347:58.65]I can't.
[348:00.27]My swing takes like a full second and a half.
[348:02.23]And those guys are swinging.
[348:03.09]Ding ding.
[348:05.88]I did it, but it's okay, I'm fine.
[348:11.66]How can I last that long?
[348:29.49]Come on, no!
[348:30.43]I had a chance to get them all in one swing!
[348:35.89]Just give me the shortcut.
[348:38.59]Give me the shortcut.
[348:39.87]Come on, man.
[348:51.69]It's all blended together at this point.
[348:53.17]I gotta take a break.
[348:57.47]Give me the elevator.
[348:58.09]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[349:08.07]Fucking break that was a perfect wedge.
[349:11.69]Oh man.
[349:12.45]Oh man.
[349:13.19]Oh man.
[349:14.02]Oh man.
[349:14.50]Oh
[349:37.64]I hope this is the right way.
[349:38.70]Oh, I hope this is the right way.
[349:48.63]Where am I?
[349:49.33]Okay, yep.
[349:50.93]Who's you?
[349:54.43]Okay.
[350:00.09]Okay, I've had just about enough of you.
[350:01.83]Thank you.
[350:05.95]Alright, what do you got?
[350:08.89]Buy some of your moss.
[350:11.09]This is the dung vendor.
[350:16.58]Charcoal pine resin, that's good stuff, but... At least I know where you are.
[350:20.14]At least I know where you are.
[350:31.43]Okay, this opens up this, which brings us back to Fireland.
[350:37.11]It's all intertwined.
[350:41.57]The rat's back here.
[350:42.99]That's a lot faster.
[350:45.81]I can just lob that in the fucking sky.
[350:57.30]Just toss that in the air.
[350:58.44]That's a broken spine, but I'm okay with it.
[351:09.56]There's Mr. Pyromancy, whatever his name is.
[351:14.30]Alright.
[351:15.88]Rest at the bonfire.
[351:16.99]Okay.
[351:31.71]Yeah.
[351:33.01]Let's do the gauntlet first.
[351:40.74]Thank you.
[351:41.70]Goodbye.
[351:45.42]Do I have anything?
[351:45.94]I think I have one, right?
[351:50.20]A large soul of a lost undead.
[351:51.94]I'm not going to use it.
[351:53.98]Okay.
[351:55.00]Let's talk to Mr. Spellman.
[351:56.62]Let's see what he's got.
[352:00.00]Where is he?
[352:00.34]Over here?
[352:03.34]Falling R1.
[352:03.78]Oh, hello.
[352:04.91]I regret meeting you under such compromising circumstances.
[352:08.23]At least we both made it back unscathed.
[352:13.37]Easy for you to say.
[352:14.15]Oh, hello.
[352:14.91]Terrific to see us both in one piece.
[352:16.83]And pray that you never... Well, I am hollow, so... I'm a little too late for that.
[352:20.63]Oh, hello.
[352:21.13]Terri- Okay.
[352:25.33]Um... I think that's a good place to stop.
[352:27.21]Right before the capper demon.
[352:29.13]I had a lot of fun dicking around, exploring.
[352:39.17]My intelligence is too low to talk to him.
[352:42.23]Too dumb to match him.
[352:47.51]Falling R1.
[352:51.01]So, um... This is a great game.
[352:55.59]Looking forward to continuing to play it.
[353:01.08]So... Take us right about six hours.
[353:04.00]Hang out, do the bits.
[353:05.16]There... There are a lot of them, so... Go kill that dude right there.
[353:11.62]No, I don't wanna... I'm not killing anybody yet.
[353:13.22]Not yet.
[353:16.68]But Dark Souls Remastered will continue on... What's today?
[353:25.01]Today is Sunday.
[353:26.55]So nothing tomorrow.
[353:30.11]So Tuesday we will continue Dark Souls Remastered.
[353:36.83]Might start a little earlier on Tuesday because these streams are going to be five or six hours long each.
[353:47.49]So I'd rather try... The reason why I didn't start earlier today... I wanted to, but it was Father's Day.
[353:53.01]So... Went over to my family's house today.
[353:59.86]So you will see me again on Tuesday.
[354:04.26]Four hours of bits?
[354:05.66]No, it won't take that long.
[354:09.80]But if you just came for Dark Souls, hopefully I'll see you again.
[354:12.80]Thanks for watching.
[354:13.74]Let's do the credits.
[354:16.82]And go from there.
[354:20.14]Thank you to all the new subs, all the re-subs tonight.
[354:24.29]Much appreciated.
[354:27.19]What do you say we say all these names?
[354:29.39]I'm going to try to get it all correct.
[354:30.99]I'm going to try my hardest.

[358:07.93]And I need chat to back me up to make it official.
[358:12.45]Let's take a look.
[358:14.59]Here it is.
[358:21.17]That's pretty fucking cool.
[358:23.45]I can see that.
[358:24.01]I can see that on a t-shirt.
[358:30.92]The thing about merchandise, though, is I never do it.
[358:36.35]There's probably going to be a point where... I do... I've had a t-shirt that's been in the process of being made now.
[358:45.75]For a long time.
[358:47.09]And it's my own fault why it never got done.
[358:49.24]Because I'm a stupid moron.
[358:55.64]But merchandise, I just don't really do.
[358:58.20]I'm not going to have a store with a bunch of shirts.
[359:01.24]But I'm definitely not... You're going to get it tattooed on you.
[359:04.39]Oh god.
[359:08.69]If there comes a time when I really want to have a bunch of t-shirts, we'll do more shit like that.
[359:14.67]Hold on to this, because... Like the emote contest coming up.
[359:21.27]It'll be fun to do stuff like that.
[359:23.03]I would like to include you guys in more of those things.
[359:28.49]But in the immediate future, I have no plans to sell a t-shirt.
[359:32.63]Hydrate, you got it.
[359:36.57]That was gasoline.
[359:37.33]Why did I drink that?
[359:40.65]But thank you, it looks great.
[359:43.29]You really capture the essence of the glazed over wrap.
[359:49.92]Make some temporary tattoos.
[359:51.36]That actually would be a great temporary tattoo.
[359:57.02]Thanks, dude.
[360:00.75]Thank you Smellyboy for the $1.00.
[360:02.11]Jerma just went Jerma 98 live.
[360:03.81]I did.
[360:04.75]Scripps, thanks for the $1.50.
[360:05.75]Thanks for saving my Sunday boredom.
[360:08.77]Also, you're gonna do an IRL stream of New Vegas once you move there.
[360:11.85]Just walk from real life Goodsprings to the Strip.
[360:20.96]Might be fun.
[360:23.02]That might be fun to do something like that.
[360:24.13]Do some IRL streams in Vegas.
[360:28.39]Thank you, eefs, for the $10.
[360:29.73]How was the official podcast, Jerma?
[360:32.11]Also, I hope you have been doing alright this summer.
[360:33.83]This started off pretty fucking garbage for me.
[360:36.24]So you're helping me out a living fuckton.
[360:39.30]Thank you.
[360:39.88]Here's my bits.
[360:40.78]Love you.
[360:42.48]Thank you so much, eefs.
[360:49.04]The official podcast was a lot of fun.
[360:52.12]It's always interesting when... So, me and Charlie have not had any, ever, communication.
[360:58.97]So, it's funny when you get in, like, a Discord, and it's... Hey!
[361:04.79]Hey!
[361:06.45]Alright, here we go!
[361:08.06]It's funny to try to immediately start talking to people that you don't know.
[361:16.66]But, it was a lot of fun.
[361:18.87]Yeah, I don't know when it's going to go live.
[361:22.72]Talked about a lot of interesting things.
[361:25.88]I may have spoiled a few things.
[361:28.48]So, if you don't want to know, like, Jerma future stream spoilers, then you don't want to watch the end of that podcast, because I go over a couple of things that I'm doing.
[361:37.90]So.
[361:39.68]It gets a little real.
[361:40.44]We start talking about, like, YouTube and Twitch and monetization and money and shit.
[361:45.13]It was a good cast.
[361:46.45]I liked it.
[361:46.79]A lot of fun.
[361:51.93]Yeah, just don't listen to the last 12 minutes of that podcast if you don't want to know.
[361:57.39]It comes out on Thursday, so it'll probably be out there on Thursday.
[362:03.72]Unless there was one queued up before the one where they brought me on.
[362:07.10]I'm not sure.
[362:10.05]Is it M-rated?
[362:11.01]Yes.
[362:11.73]Very much so.
[362:15.43]But thank you, Eves.
[362:18.68]Sorry that you've started off the summer here pretty terribly, but hopefully it turns around for you.
[362:25.36]Thank you, wonderful telephone for the $1.
[362:28.21]Happy Father's Day, Dad.
[362:29.33]I love you, Dad.
[362:31.95]News to me, but thanks, man.
[362:33.87]Appreciate it.
[362:35.35]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $3.
[362:36.67]Jerma, now that you've experienced big boy weapons, please say this part loudly.
[362:41.39]You must watch the giant dad video.
[362:43.13]I've already seen it.
[362:45.31]What do you got for rings?
[362:47.63]I've seen it.
[362:52.66]Giants.
[362:53.36]Giants.
[362:54.04]Giants.
[363:00.04]Thank you for your line, though.
[363:00.88]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1 Jerma.
[363:02.22]I hope you liked the name you picked.
[363:04.16]I don't remember what it was.
[363:05.02]It was like Spaghetti Penis or something, right?
[363:07.62]No, it was Silver Penne.
[363:10.02]That's awful.
[363:11.87]Glad we're stuck with that for the next, like, 45 hours of this game.
[363:15.25]Okay.
[363:20.80]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[363:22.04]Happy Father's Day, Dad.
[363:23.12]I apparently have a lot of illegitimate children I wasn't aware of, but hi, kids.
[363:28.09]Thanks.
[363:30.11]Thank you, GK9999, for the $1.
[363:32.71]Should have named your character Waluigi.
[363:35.31]Waluigi.
[363:38.54]I can't say it right.
[363:40.18]Thank you, Ivory, for the $1.
[363:41.22]People in the bot have already skipped this part.
[363:42.88]Jeremy, do you realize plenty of your best content comes from your character creation and your wacky antics?
[363:51.13]Love you, Ibu.
[363:52.62]What is this?
[363:53.42]I don't know what that is.
[363:59.32]Yeah, but we went down a different path today.
[364:03.40]We were trying to go down a bird path.
[364:09.33]It didn't work out so well, and we ended up just making the same character that's my Dark Souls 3 character, the guy with the huge nose.
[364:16.01]We made Skeeter.
[364:16.87]Well, I guess it is Skeeter.
[364:17.93]I like this character.
[364:18.59]He's great.
[364:18.97]Can I rename him Skeeter?
[364:23.77]Thanks, thank you the giant wrap of the one dollar.
[364:25.37]Hey Jerma.
[364:25.71]It's hard being a giant rat Everyone is afraid of me and everyone judges me, but I feel like your streams are a place where I can fit in Thank You Jerma chat Thank you the giant rat we really appreciate your presence Sir squeegee thanks to the one dollar.
[364:42.54]It's good to be back in Muppet souls Thank you the expert new for the two dollars hello Jerma hello How are you expert?
[364:54.33]AndyGSW, thanks for the $1.
[364:55.85]I didn't know the character creation in this had a face scan feature.
[365:01.19]That doesn't look... This doesn't look like me.
[365:05.93]It doesn't.
[365:08.37]It doesn't.
[365:08.91]I'm gonna say that over and over again, but whatever.
[365:11.95]SirFeline, thanks for the $1.
[365:13.11]The character you made is literally Glue Man Incarnate.
[365:16.41]We'll see if you named him appropriately.
[365:18.05]I didn't.
[365:19.55]His name doesn't make any sense, but whatever.
[365:23.36]Uh, Joshua Bowler, thanks for the $5.
[365:24.68]First time donating.
[365:27.01]Love you, Jerry.
[365:27.61]You may have missed an opportunity by not naming him a spicy meat-a-ball.
[365:33.81]Thanks for being you.
[365:39.20]Didn't we just name some, like, food or, like, Italian food?
[365:44.24]What was it?
[365:44.66]Oh, it was the Godfather.
[365:47.14]We made Tim Italian.
[365:50.25]God, saying that out loud hurts.
[365:54.05]Thank you double D onion rings I That's not what it is, I think it's doubled onion rings Actually, I kind of like it the other way.
[366:06.62]I Kind of like it as double D onion ring Those are both huge onion rings Is that the way it is is that the name is it here I
[366:26.17]There's no capital.
[366:31.95]Oh, yeah, yike.
[366:34.94]Lewd.
[366:35.28]Especially after stream chat.
[366:37.10]We just, sometimes we fuck around.
[366:41.18]But thank you, Double D Onion Rings, for the 1,000 bits.
[366:44.16]Thanks for the 10 bucks, man.
[366:47.18]Hey, Jerm, I'm shipping out for Air Force Basic in eight days.
[366:49.66]You've been a big positive influence on me, and I hope you have good streams while I'm gone.
[366:54.23]Thank you so much, Double D Onion Rings.
[366:59.09]It's double dunyon.
[367:05.53]It's double dunyon rings.
[367:08.37]It's not double D onion rings.
[367:15.32]Good luck to you.
[367:18.04]Go into the Air Force basic training.
[367:21.40]Take care.
[367:21.72]I wish you the best.
[367:24.10]Hopefully you do very well, man.
[367:30.92]That makes for the 10 bucks.
[367:33.10]We'll try to have some good streams while you're not here.
[367:35.84]And then you can watch them.
[367:39.90]I can't get over Double D onion rings.
[367:43.68]Everyone's picturing it right now.
[367:44.84]I know you are.
[367:48.45]That's on the menu at Davin Buster's.
[367:53.97]Double D... No, that's on the menu.
[367:56.57]That would be a Hooters item.
[367:59.57]And it's just two giant onion rings.
[368:06.28]What a stupid idea.
[368:14.50]I can't get over it.
[368:15.29]I don't know why.
[368:15.89]It won't leave me alone.
[368:20.67]But thanks, man.
[368:21.71]Good luck to you, for real.
[368:23.65]Thank you, sir, feline, for the $1.
[368:24.99]When do we get Crest Souls emote?
[368:29.27]Uhm. Wait why? Crest Souls?
[368:35.27]Crest Souls?
[368:40.27]I don't know what that means but thank you.
[368:41.27]Hold on I got 1% battery. I gotta write a text real quick hold on.
[368:58.24]Kim wants to know what the Netflix password is.
[369:02.02]Uh, okay, hold on.
[369:06.16]What's the Netflix password?
[369:09.58]Uh, hold on.
[369:12.64]Hey, it's... It's 2-1-1 hamburger dick.
[369:19.19]Double D onion ring.
[369:21.65]What if I just said it?
[369:38.16]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[369:44.48]Alright, I gotta go quick.
[369:53.35]We're gonna do the rest of these bits in 30 minutes.
[370:02.43]The password's supposed to be a number.
[370:04.74]No, it's not.
[370:08.05]Alright, here we go.
[370:09.53]Lightning round.
[370:10.09]30-minute lightning round.
[370:11.61]You ready?
[370:14.46]Cressoul's emote.
[370:15.28]I don't know.
[370:15.62]I don't know if we're ever going to do that.
[370:17.74]I don't think so.
[370:18.14]Make sure when the emote contest happens, maybe you want to try that out.
[370:20.84]I don't know.
[370:21.40]I don't know.
[370:21.90]That's for you.
[370:22.98]Thank you, Smithsmith, for the $1.
[370:25.13]Oh, yes, I see the evil in your eyes.
[370:26.47]But, you know, you buy him, you take him, we'll destroy him at SummerSlam.
[370:28.95]Oh, my goodness, did you hear that?
[370:31.96]Oh yeah, didn't I say I was going to have a new subsound or I was going to delete my Twitch channel?
[370:37.19]Like by this weekend or something?
[370:39.17]I think it might have been by this stream.
[370:42.81]Whoops, see ya.
[370:46.12]GK999, thanks for the $1.
[370:47.68]I'll probably be in bed by the time you answer this, but are you planning on doing the DLC?
[370:50.60]Yes, I plan on doing as much as I can.
[370:55.13]I don't.
[370:57.56]I abstain from any violence to the NPCs.
[371:00.30]It's the chat that are the enablers that want me to kill everybody that they see.
[371:04.00]I have not harmed a single person that's an NPC.
[371:06.76]And I don't plan to.
[371:09.52]Thank you, KyroToby, again for your $250.
[371:11.51]That's a ton of money in one drop.
[371:14.27]Thank you so much, Kyro.
[371:17.35]Kvas...
[371:19.01]Good old Kvas.
[371:19.95]Mod Kvas.
[371:20.83]Thanks for the $1.20.
[371:21.71]I can't top $2.50, but I'll give you what I got.
[371:24.89]You're my favorite.
[371:25.59]Thanks, man.
[371:27.41]I'm so itchy.
[371:29.17]Felix Felix, thanks for the $2.50.
[371:31.13]Hey, did you remember that $250 donation was radical?
[371:34.95]I'll match it, though.
[371:36.40]One bit equals $1, right?
[371:37.22]Yeah.
[371:37.60]Thanks for the $250.
[371:42.14]Thank you, Felix.
[371:45.60]Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[371:46.64]Every time you say, yup yup yup, I remember this.
[371:48.74]What is it?
[371:49.28]Let's see.
[371:49.48]So I just created this dope website.
[371:53.94]What? Oh, no, no, this is the ad.
[371:55.52]I was like, what website?
[371:59.99]Yup yup yup, baby, baby.
[372:02.00]Oh, this is the muppets, the yup yup yup yup.
[372:05.00]Yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup.
[372:07.00]Yeah I remember those. Great guy. Fucking incredible creative mind.
[372:13.28]Thank you, Lucky Bone, for the $5.
[372:14.40]Jerma, I reset for a second month.
[372:17.38]Hope it went through.
[372:19.00]Thank you, Lucky Bone.
[372:20.48]I appreciate the month-to-month support here for two months in a row.
[372:24.21]And the $5 that you just gave.
[372:25.97]So thank you so much.
[372:27.49]Thank you to SirFeline for the $1.
[372:28.89]The poison ivy excuse was pretty fucking lame.
[372:32.13]Oh, really?
[372:32.73]I showed it on stream.
[372:34.19]I'm covered in welts, itchy welts all over me.
[372:36.59]You saw it.
[372:37.07]It wasn't lame.
[372:37.69]You saw it.
[372:39.00]Thank you, BoneJackal for the $1.
[372:40.46]Mmm, I'm a thirsty little flower.
[372:42.72]You have to model me to use your pee.
[372:45.16]Alright.
[372:46.22]Thank you, SirFeline for the $1.
[372:47.50]That looks a little worse than poison ivy.
[372:51.54]It might be shingles.
[372:52.62]I don't know.
[372:53.18]I'm in trouble.
[372:55.06]Let's just put it that way.
[372:57.83]Maybe one day.
[373:23.38]Uh... Okay.
[373:32.25]That like freaks me out, man.
[373:35.35]People spying on me in the grocery store.
[373:40.02]Thank you, Danda.
[373:40.86]Appreciate it.
[373:42.06]Next time, tell your friend to say hello.
[373:45.42]So I can go... And put my hand in his face and say... Until I may watch out for the electrical interference.
[373:56.64]Thank you, uh, FKU Mark.
[374:01.44]Uh, let me bang, bro.
[374:05.16]What?
[374:09.13]Uh... Alright, bro, luck, thanks for the one dollar, uh, the clip.
[374:14.67]Thank you, bro, luck for the one dollar.

[374:33.55]Thank you spree over the one dollar the most you baited you baitable streamer on Twitch Jerma jacks.
[374:37.62]Thank you.
[374:38.70]You can't hear it It would probably was low he was just it was me saying that I do have toilet and shipping I don't know my desktop is quiet Alright, fuck.
[374:49.18]Hold on.
[374:49.62]I gotta turn my shit up.
[374:50.72]Oh
[374:56.83]Adjust the system.
[374:57.55]How did I do this?
[375:01.77]Here you go.
[375:02.41]Loud enough for you?
[375:08.57]Thank you, Proluck, for the $1.
[375:09.69]Hey, Jerma985 here.
[375:12.37]I'm laughing my ass off.
[375:13.27]Hey, have you guys ever wondered how much shit you pass through your toilet?
[375:18.64]That's it.
[375:18.90]That's what you guys would need to hear so badly.
[375:20.50]Thank you, Spreo, for that $1.
[375:22.14]Thank you, Lord Camila.
[375:24.94]For the 10 bucks, no message, thank you so much.
[375:26.91]10 bucks again from Lord Camilius.
[375:30.19]Camilius?
[375:31.61]Lord Camilius.
[375:32.85]Thank you for the $20 here total.
[375:34.89]Much appreciated.
[375:35.45]Did you ever kill Dark Eater Medir?
[375:40.12]From Dark Souls 3, the giant optional dragon.
[375:43.02]I did not.
[375:44.72]I got too frustrated and ran away forever.
[375:49.86]But thank you, Rolok.
[375:51.32]And thank you, Sprio.
[375:52.38]And thank you, Lord Camilius, for the $20.
[375:56.25]I don't know.
[375:56.57]I don't know.
[376:21.62]I feel like chat is an interesting specimen because I feel like there is like the seven deadly sins.
[376:31.04]Depends on what day it is.
[376:32.44]Seven days of the week, it's going to be a different deadly sin.
[376:35.96]Chat seems to sometimes be all about lust.
[376:38.92]Right?
[376:39.20]Oh my god, let me listen.
[376:40.52]Is that a girl?
[376:41.74]Girl on the screen!
[376:42.80]Right, that's lust.
[376:43.60]Depends on if that might be on a Tuesday or something.
[376:45.70]Greed.
[376:46.66]You know, the greed could be on a Wednesday.
[376:49.01]Wrath is people just make fun of me all day.
[376:52.49]Sloth is a next boring ResidentSleeper.
[376:55.83]It depends on what day it is.
[377:11.27]Today?
[377:12.49]Today?
[377:12.79]I don't know.
[377:13.23]What do we have?
[377:13.65]What do we have today?
[377:15.93]We definitely didn't have wrath today.
[377:17.47]I can tell you that.
[377:18.13]We had wrath during the Destroy All Humans stream.
[377:23.71]It wasn't sloth.
[377:27.42]I don't think it was... It wasn't greed.
[377:31.68]It was not lust today.
[377:34.74]Was it?
[377:37.68]I don't think it was Lust.
[377:41.02]And look, it's alright, though, because... I love chat.
[377:45.11]I really do.
[377:45.79]Chat makes me laugh all the fucking time.
[377:47.69]Because especially when you combine... On, like, Saturday and Sunday, when you combine all the seven deadly sins, you get the whole Power Ranger.
[377:54.07]You get the whole Megazoid.
[377:54.89]We did have some Lust moments.
[378:02.25]But thank you.
[378:04.97]I happen to enjoy chat.
[378:08.45]Sometimes, you know, when I look over and enough people tell me to go fuck myself, it can make me feel a little bad.
[378:18.60]But, for the most part, like 98% of the time, I feel like most of you guys are just having fun.
[378:26.97]And that's all I care about.
[378:31.91]Oh, yeah.
[378:33.55]Sometimes I feel like this.
[378:34.61]Sometimes I feel like this.
[378:38.11]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1 there.
[378:40.63]Super Seal, thanks for the $1.
[378:41.71]FromSoftware Dads in the chat right now.
[378:46.95]Can't wait to play your new game.
[378:50.17]Thank you, Bubble Gum, for the $10.
[378:54.05]Bubble Gum, give me an uwu.
[378:59.54]You just got it.
[379:00.12]Thank you for the $10.
[379:00.82]Thank you, Reaper, for the $5.
[379:02.10]The $1, your name is 500.
[379:05.61]Can we have a straw poll to change the name of GermaJex to GermaTroll?
[379:11.27]No.
[379:13.29]I want people to... No.
[379:14.92]You can use it for whatever you want.
[379:17.12]It's not what I'm going to officially call it.
[379:19.44]Hey, StyxRenegade, thanks for the $1.50.
[379:20.74]Hey, Jerma, a couple of streams ago I mentioned your great art skills of jermaExpensive and asked to draw my fursona.
[379:26.96]To which said it would be $1.50.
[379:27.96]So here's $1.50 and here's my fursona.
[379:30.30]Get drawing, boy.
[379:33.96]What is this?
[379:37.05]You really want to come at me with this here, man?
[379:40.13]Because I was under the impression that dragons were not called furries.
[379:44.05]They were called scalos or something.
[379:48.25]I thought that was a big part of the fandom.
[379:54.23]Lizards and snakes and stuff, those are not furries.
[380:00.04]Those are scalios.
[380:10.29]expert how do I know this because somebody else told me they corrected me I've been corrected I called a fur I called a a snake thing a furry and I was excuse me that is incorrect I was corrected
[380:40.82]He gave you the money.
[380:45.20]I'll draw it someday.
[380:49.34]Would I ever marry a dragon?
[380:50.74]No!
[380:52.18]No, I would not.
[380:52.88]I would not marry a dragon.
[380:54.18]I would not marry an animal, guys.
[380:59.52]I'm not gonna... What kind of question are you asking me?
[381:04.96]You would.
[381:05.38]I would.
[381:09.14]What are you talking about?
[381:16.29]Some of you guys gotta start burping in the Willy Wonka fan machine thing and like float back down to Earth.
[381:25.17]Before you go all the way up there and like grandpa's head gets severed by the blade.
[381:30.79]You do a few burps and bring yourself back down to Earth.
[381:45.29]But thank you, SnicksRenegade.
[381:46.97]Appreciate it, man.
[381:48.37]Maybe I'll draw you sometime.
[381:49.77]Thank you, Djembemen, for the two dollars.
[381:51.69]For your information, I'm so bad at Dark Souls.
[381:53.77]I've played it for five years, and I haven't even rang the bell at the top of the church.
[382:00.66]Oh, but these games are hard, man.
[382:02.68]They are.
[382:04.74]They're not easy.
[382:08.48]The only reason why I'm even remotely comfortable at all attempting to play this game on stream is just because I've played all the other ones.
[382:17.61]Just a lot.
[382:19.37]And even though I'm not that great at the game, I still am comfortable enough playing it.
[382:27.57]These games are not easy.
[382:32.08]Don't feel bad about that.
[382:34.90]Dark Souls, Bloodborne, these are the games, right?
[382:37.30]And I know a lot of you, maybe a lot of you guys have friends.
[382:39.54]Quick story.
[382:41.43]You know that group that you are friends with.
[382:44.07]Oh yeah, I got my friends.
[382:45.49]Okay, my friends.
[382:47.68]I would never tell any of my kind of IRL friends of mine around here to ever play this game.
[382:55.21]Because they would just have no idea what was going on.
[382:58.29]To a point where they would not even be able to get out of the Asylum Demons level.
[383:05.09]They wouldn't be able to.
[383:06.69]They would have no idea what was going on.
[383:12.57]People ask me, oh, hey man, so you play this game, Dark Souls 3, is it good?
[383:18.58]No.
[383:19.98]No, don't buy that.
[383:22.30]You don't want that.
[383:22.94]Yeah, it looks like a hack and slash game.
[383:25.60]It looks like fun.
[383:27.50]Don't buy that.
[383:29.62]Don't do it.
[383:32.17]Alright.
[383:32.39]Thanks for the input.
[383:38.45]All your friends are better at Dark Souls than me.
[383:41.97]He was saying that.
[383:46.58]My girlfriend tried Dark Souls 3, and when she got to the boss, it got mad at me for letting her try it.
[383:53.76]But people just aren't prepared for... And neither was I. Go... Look, if you want a little bit of a history lesson here, go back to my Dark Souls video from, like, 2012.
[384:06.61]I had no idea what was going on in this game.
[384:15.43]I thought this was an action hack and slash game.
[384:18.27]I was playing it so incorrectly.
[384:22.85]But that's what everybody does.
[384:30.39]The Dark Souls system, like the actual gameplay of Dark Souls,
[384:36.15]I think is probably the best kind of video game I've ever played.
[384:41.23]I really do.
[384:41.71]I think that they're the most interesting experiences you could ever have in a video game.
[384:46.27]100%.
[384:48.15]Obviously, there's been a lot of people that have made similar games over the years because they've been so popular, but man, something about these experiences is that you will not be able to have more interesting stuff in another game
[385:10.32]Because they don't hold your hand.
[385:11.28]I don't think it's even that though.
[385:13.28]I think it's more the... Walking around and looking at stuff and collecting stuff and needing to be practice and be patient and... Because you need to be... There are a lot of other games out there that don't hold your hand.
[385:29.37]But the way the collecting the souls and leveling up, it's one of those things.
[385:35.65]It just scratches almost every single itch I could possibly want scratched.
[385:41.70]But I did not like Nioh.
[385:43.16]You know, people are going to give me shit for saying that.
[385:46.25]But I didn't like Nioh.
[385:47.77]And I was shitfaced when I played it.
[385:49.29]But it doesn't matter.
[385:50.07]I still wasn't a fan.
[385:56.37]Souls games aren't even that hard.
[385:57.53]They just don't pull their punches and guide you along like most games today.
[386:04.18]That's true.
[386:04.68]Alright, I've got to keep going.
[386:05.60]I've got to get out of here soon, so...
[386:08.37]Thank you, DJMembermen.
[386:11.71]Captain Morgan, thanks for the two bucks.
[386:13.89]Jerma, we live in a society and the Great Gamer Rebellion will soon release us from it.
[386:19.14]The prophecy dictates that only the one with the Blockbuster Gamer Certificate will lead us to victory, and I have searched long and hard for the one who holds it.
[386:26.22]The fate of many gamers lies on your compact shoulders.
[386:29.44]Free us from the chads who rule over us.
[386:31.92]Godspeed, you furry bastard.
[386:40.82]Chad.
[386:41.24]Alright.
[386:46.06]Well, thank you.
[386:49.35]Appreciate it.
[386:49.99]Thank you, Captain Morgan.
[386:50.91]Thank you, Mighty Waffle, for the $1 hydration.
[386:53.21]Thank you.
[386:53.67]I'm a monk.
[386:55.15]Thank you for the Sir Feline.
[386:56.71]Thanks for the $1.
[386:57.41]Jerma is mid-rolling but refuses to use any shield out of principle, even though medium shields have instant parries.
[387:02.99]Omega lull.
[387:06.66]I'm just used to dodging.
[387:11.44]That's the blood-borne mindset that I just can't ever erase.
[387:17.55]Zarina, Alexandra, thanks for the $1.
[387:19.63]I don't understand FromSoft's hard-on for poison swamps.
[387:23.05]None of them are good levels, none of them are fun to play, and the one in Dark Souls 3 makes me want to claw my eyes out with a stick.
[387:29.61]If Sekiro has a poison swamp, I'm refunding it ten times over.
[387:34.43]Also, since I now have your attention, can I get someone in chat to draw Jerma getting it on

[388:03.33]Trying to time dodges.
[388:06.13]Don't say it.
[388:06.74]I ain't gonna say it.
[388:08.62]I got myself in trouble before.
[388:10.74]Sprio, thanks for the $1.
[388:11.82]I have not laughed this hard since a long time.
[388:14.04]Thanks for that.
[388:15.95]I'm glad you're having a good time, Sprio.
[388:17.11]Thank you.
[388:18.67]Mateo gave $100.
[388:19.27]Just to reiterate that, thank you again, Mateo.
[388:24.22]Lot of money.
[388:24.70]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[388:25.93]Jeremiah, I told you to get open-back headphones.
[388:30.11]It will fix your problem.
[388:32.65]I know, I know, I know.
[388:34.31]I'm so stupid.
[388:35.25]I'll get them.
[388:40.65]Siri, add open-back headphones to the list of things that I would like to, in the future, potentially own in my shelf and have them soon for my friends and my family.
[388:51.34]Thank you.
[388:55.38]My phone died.
[388:58.46]Oh, come on.
[389:00.34]No, the phone's dead.
[389:02.42]It was processing and the phone died.
[389:09.48]Oh, well.
[389:12.65]Thank you, Casey.
[389:13.29]Thank you, Tar.
[389:16.73]Thank you, Tar.
[389:18.59]Tar Lachrin for the three bucks.
[389:19.85]Jerma, I actually understand what you're talking about with the glasses thing.
[389:23.77]I've experienced similar...
[389:26.27]Similarities whenever I've gotten a new prescription.
[389:28.93]Maybe it's something to do with ADHD that we both have.
[389:31.67]However, I just power through it for a day and then my brain adjusts to the change and it's fine.
[389:38.35]Yes.
[389:40.57]I have been told that you need to adjust.
[389:43.39]The problem is it doesn't matter for me.
[389:47.97]I tried my latest prescription that I got a few years ago.
[389:51.43]I wore it for like two weeks straight.
[389:53.57]And it just made me... My life was a living hell.
[389:56.49]Just migraines, headaches, sleep problems, just... My eyes were always watering, it just... We weren't comfortable.
[390:04.51]But yeah, I don't like it.
[390:11.03]And then we'll get contacts.
[390:13.21]I'm one of those people that cannot put anything close to their eye.
[390:17.91]If you put your finger to my eye and try to touch it, or if you are... If I go outside and it's windy, tears will be streaming down my face.
[390:30.22]Even with the remote small amount of gust, wind, sayonara, I am bawling my eyes out.
[390:38.13]I have incredibly sensitive eyes.
[390:44.02]That might have something to do with it.
[390:44.98]You have that same problem.
[390:49.01]Yeah.
[390:49.63]It's the worst.
[390:50.17]ADHD anxiety is where it's at.
[391:01.14]No, um, excuse me, why don't you, why, uh, we talk about, like, issues here?
[391:06.04]I got a, uh, come on, man, I've got the kid cuisine.
[391:09.91]You know, it's more interesting when you have the kid cuisine of, uh, different health issues.
[391:14.67]So you got, the kid cuisine usually has the four chicken nuggets in the middle.
[391:18.57]That's the biggest problem.
[391:19.63]Then you got the little brownie, which is a small but sweet problem that you don't have, like, a big deal.
[391:23.33]You know, it doesn't affect your life negatively, right?
[391:26.98]mean it's not the greatest thing but it's there then you got the thing of peas which is your health concerns you know you're gonna eat healthy you get three sections so my biggest part of my kid cuisine health problems um definitely is right in the middle of the chicken nuggets are and that's uh I have ulcerative colitis right so that sucks it's a it takes up a lot of problems it makes a lot of issues for me now the brownie I have adhd too
[391:51.49]And that's not a big deal.
[391:53.45]It doesn't bother me that much.
[391:55.47]And then I have on the side there, where the peas are, small OCD issues.
[392:02.52]So you have to combine them all and you're gonna eat the whole thing.
[392:08.89]Oh, look at this guy going off on a tangent.
[392:11.53]He's like, what did he say?
[392:13.45]Pee's and mind and anxiety and ADHD as a kid cuisine meal?
[392:21.26]What is this reference?
[392:34.68]Me explaining that ramble, that ramble was just ADHD.
[392:38.45]So I don't have any, I just have an ADHD problem, right?
[392:43.51]Fucking weirdo.
[392:45.87]Did you hear what he said?
[392:46.93]He was like comparing Kit Cuisine to anxiety.
[392:51.20]What the fuck?
[392:51.94]Oh my God, I can't wait to tweet this.
[392:56.95]Hey, Kale, thanks for the amount of money that I'm not supposed to talk about.
[392:59.93]I repeat.
[393:01.99]Thank you, Yeager Marius, for the $5.
[393:05.79]Thank you.
[393:08.79]Hey, Dr. Krim, thanks for the $5.
[393:10.17]Appreciate it.
[393:12.92]No messages, and thank you.
[393:14.22]Almost done here.
[393:15.71]Thank you, Zarina Alexandra, for the $1.45.
[393:19.23]Hey, Jerm, I thought I'd give you some tips.
[393:21.41]It's recommended to level resistance up to 30, so Blighttown isn't as tough.
[393:25.55]Keep it up, my dude.
[393:26.43]Loving the stream.
[393:26.99]Alright, you got snots that actually came out of my nose right there. 30.
[393:42.05]That's so much.
[393:44.67]Thank you, Zerino.
[393:47.83]Thank you, Prime Vino, for the $5.
[393:50.25]Happy 17th of June.
[393:54.01]Uncle.
[393:55.15]Thank you.
[393:56.55]Happy 17th of June.
[393:59.94]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[394:01.26]This is the ideal male body.
[394:02.48]You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
[394:04.82]I don't know.
[394:05.32]I think I showed my poison ivy on stream.
[394:08.36]Thank you.
[394:08.76]Skull Kids for the $1.
[394:09.46]Missed your...
[394:11.24]Destroy All Humans 2 stream.
[394:14.44]Well, I got news for you.
[394:15.38]You're going to like this a lot.
[394:17.06]Didn't play Destroy All Humans 2.
[394:18.52]We beat Destroy All Humans 1.
[394:21.46]Destroy All Humans 2 I will play on a future stream.
[394:24.90]So, you're in luck.
[394:26.72]Loved Pandemic as a kid.
[394:27.90]I was wondering if you ever thought about playing either of the Mercenaries games on stream.
[394:31.20]Yes.
[394:32.56]I will play Mercenaries 2 at some point.
[394:36.02]It's on the list of things to play.
[394:40.68]Sir Feline, thanks for the one dollar.
[394:42.99]Jerma, using the Drake Sword is making me physically cringe.
[394:45.59]Come on, Jerma.
[394:48.29]I just wanted to see what it was like.
[394:50.25]Look, I told you guys this already, and I'm going to reiterate this again, and I'm going to hammer this home.
[394:59.90]I don't... Holy shit, it took you four hours to beat the Bell Gargoyles?
[395:06.96]Why are you using the Drake Sword?
[395:09.04]Is there a reason why he's wearing the review set?
[395:11.18]I just... I wanna... Did you hear that?
[395:15.46]Like... I just want to see what they... I want to experience it.
[395:19.91]I want to see.
[395:20.41]I want to equip things and look at stuff and... This is the problem with playing a game.
[395:25.69]And I know you just obviously... This is... People just joking around and people having fun.
[395:31.90]But... Streaming a game that's... You know, five or six years old...
[395:38.69]And I totally understand where everyone comes from when they talk about this, like I brought it up before.
[395:43.83]You know everything.
[395:46.09]And you know where everything is, and you know the best weapons, and you know how angry those best weapons might make you.
[395:53.23]But I don't.
[395:54.37]I've never seen it before in my life.
[395:59.03]The Drake Sword?
[395:59.61]It's the first time I've ever put it on.
[396:03.97]That R2?
[396:04.37]Whoa, I've seen that for the first time.
[396:07.44]I just want to see.
[396:08.04]I just want to see.
[396:10.32]That's all.
[396:10.86]Let's see what it does.
[396:17.14]You're not even taking this seriously.
[396:21.33]When am I going to become a Monster Rancher streamer again?
[396:25.59]What a fantastic game.
[396:29.13]Then wear glasses.
[396:30.09]Oh, goddammit.
[396:30.87]Alright, thanks.
[396:32.17]Thank you to Dirty Margaret for the ten bucks.
[396:36.51]Thank you, Dirty Margaret.
[396:37.33]Thank you.
[396:38.76]Thank you for being around for the last few years.
[396:40.12]Happy to see you.
[396:40.86]That's very, very humbling to know that I'm the only person that brings you to Twitch.
[397:06.15]so hope you're enjoying yourself thank you so much for the 10 bucks the one sam thanks for the two bucks use uh tech new for poison ivy it works wonders every time I get it tech new t-e-c-n-u tech new what is that not gonna look that up don't get an answer about Monster Ranger 4
[397:30.62]Um, I don't know, I was told, we played Monster Rancher 3, and it was really, really, really bad.
[397:42.25]Unplayable bad.
[397:43.60]I didn't even want to continue playing it.
[397:47.06]On stream, I, on stream, probably put at least 20 to 40 hours or so, right, in Monster Rancher 2.
[397:55.26]I wanted to be done in an hour in Monster Rancher 3.
[398:01.04]So, I heard 4 is kind of the same thing as 3, but with some improvements, right?
[398:05.53]Let's go back to 2.
[398:08.33]I actually probably would go back to 2.
[398:10.37]Just for, like, a fun, chill stream we hang out and just play.
[398:15.03]That's not against the realm of all possibilities.
[398:21.11]But, thank you.
[398:25.80]Uh, thank you, uh... Tar again, for the $1.00.
[398:32.42]Tar Algerman.
[398:34.00]Oh, alright, you need to tell me again.
[398:35.68]Like, just phonetically spell out the name.
[398:38.26]So I'm gonna copy and paste it.
[398:39.48]I'm gonna copy it and I'm gonna put it in a fucking notepad.
[398:41.08]So I can drill this into my brain.
[398:43.78]I'm gonna practice this off-stream.
[398:49.83]You've been around for so long, and I've read your name so many times.
[398:54.09]And I still can't do it.
[398:56.81]I want to copy and paste your name into a notepad, for real.
[399:01.96]But thank you.
[399:03.54]Streamer plays for three hours and hasn't memorized anything.
[399:08.46]Yeah, for me personally, I don't like not having fast travel all the time.
[399:12.54]It's just too hard to memorize anything after three hours.
[399:15.69]The love of Dark Souls 1's no fast travel interconnected world design... Tar-al-Akron.
[399:24.97]Tar-al-Akron.
[399:27.49]You got it.
[399:29.90]I totally feel you.
[399:30.34]I really do.
[399:30.62]I've been seeing how things are connecting together piece by piece.
[399:55.16]I'm just an insufferable attention deficit moron.
[400:00.91]And just give me a goddamn gravestone that I can click on and teleport somewhere.
[400:12.00]Trevor, what's the best Kanye album?
[400:13.48]Kanye 2.
[400:17.86]I don't know.
[400:20.18]But thank you, Tar Alakran, again, for the $4.00.
[400:26.26]The lack of fast travel is something that you immediately appreciate right away in the rest of the series.
[400:30.36]It sucks to die and lose all your stuff the first time.
[400:34.14]But after you play for a while, you'll probably grow to love it.
[400:38.86]Well, I can tell you something right now.
[400:40.76]So far, the first, you know, from what I remember, the first, like, four or five hours of this game is way better than the first four or five hours of Dark Souls 2.
[400:55.16]Something about Dark Souls 2 just felt so empty.
[400:58.56]It was almost like a boss rush game, if that makes any sense.
[401:06.29]But, thank you, Tar.
[401:10.85]Again, Tar, another dollar here.
[401:14.47]Four dollars.
[401:16.21]Sorry, I'm a game designer in real life.
[401:19.98]No, I completely understand where you're coming from.
[401:22.76]It's a great feature.
[401:24.68]I just personally... I just want to get right to the point.
[401:31.95]That's just the kind of way that I like to play games.
[401:33.93]And backtracking, walking around, connecting dots, it's fun.
[401:39.61]But, I mean, my attention issues, I have so many problems with it.
[401:47.87]But that's cool that you're a game designer.
[401:54.23]Uh... SirFeline, thanks for the $1.
[401:55.87]I don't know if everyone agrees with me, but the amount of backseating in chat was insane tonight.
[402:00.84]Maybe sub only mode would fix it.
[402:04.92]Um...
[402:10.12]That's just the way it is.
[402:12.75]It's Dark Souls, man.
[402:15.29]It's just gonna happen.
[402:18.01]So, it's gonna happen regardless.
[402:20.77]You can turn on sub-only mode and it'll still happen.
[402:23.90]I've completely accepted it at this point.
[402:25.98]Which is why I've embraced it.
[402:28.14]If you guys want to give me tips, and sure, I would love to see them, right?
[402:35.35]This is the nature of the beast.
[402:40.43]I backseat even though I never even played Dark Souls.
[402:44.81]Well, so you're just doing it to be part of the party.
[402:48.68]You're doing it to, like, have... You're doing it to take the piss.
[402:51.04]And that's fine.
[402:51.94]That's fine.
[402:54.26]Well, thank you, feline.
[402:55.10]Thank you.
[402:55.44]Sunkisses has used a thousand bits.
[403:00.01]Thank... Well, that's a pretty cool username you got there.
[403:03.35]Thanks for the ten bucks, man.
[403:06.37]My girlfriend DarkForce2k subbed earlier while you were ripping your skin off.
[403:12.53]Please call her sexy in your deepest voice.
[403:19.33]I'm talking about your girlfriend, man.
[403:22.35]You didn't want me to do that.
[403:31.08]No, she just said... No, I ain't gonna do that.
[403:37.34]I ain't doing that.
[403:39.24]Thank you so much, Sunkisses.
[403:43.24]Oh, this is, this got awkward.
[403:46.83]I'm not gonna, I'm not doing it!
[403:48.93]I've already made my decision.
[403:51.15]Regis, skip your bullshit.
[403:54.23]Stop it, Regis.
[403:55.01]Don't sit there and stare at me.
[403:56.23]I gave you my final answer, and I said final answer immediately after answering the question.
[404:00.50]Don't pause for 12 seconds.
[404:02.96]I already said it.
[404:06.26]I'm a scammer.
[404:08.41]How about this?
[404:08.87]I'll just say all those words.
[404:13.37]Where is it?
[404:17.41]Okay, so... No.
[404:19.86]No.
[404:20.40]No.
[404:21.64]No.
[404:24.16]I already said it.
[404:25.86]I have a pretty deep speaking voice.
[404:28.50]Already, don't I?
[404:30.96]I have a fairly deep speaking voice.
[404:35.49]So as long as you can take what I've said and move it around a little bit, put it in your audacity program, lower it down just a tad, you know, nothing too major, but enough to get the real juices out of it.
[404:53.04]Thank you, Sputa, for the $5.
[404:54.24]Bill Clinton.
[404:57.05]Hey, I've been role-playing, I've been replaying Bloodborne last week, and it's OST is probably my favorite in any video game.
[405:05.64]Which song from Bloodborne is your favorite?
[405:08.38]That is very easy.
[405:10.54]The song when you fight... Spoiler alert.
[405:16.06]Spoiler alert.
[405:17.22]If you haven't played Bloodborne and you plan to, it's one of the best games ever made.
[405:20.76]So you might want to close your ears for five seconds starting right now.
[405:26.08]The Ludwig the Holy Blade fight.
[405:28.78]The music is incredible during that entire encounter.
[405:33.93]And that entire encounter is one of my favorite boss fights ever, so.
[405:44.59]Garfield the Monday Killer.
[405:45.67]Thanks for the dollar, man.
[405:49.55]If it isn't the Germtastic streamer.
[405:51.87]Sorry I wasn't able to attend yesterday's stream.
[405:53.71]I was at a pool party with pals, and then I took a long catnap, so I couldn't give you the Garf bucks you deserve.
[405:59.42]Anyhow, Jerma, I came to ask you for advice.
[406:03.50]My girlfriend hasn't spoken to me in nearly two months, and I'm starting to get concerned.
[406:08.06]My phone refuses to let my texts go through, so I've been using someone else to talk to her.
[406:12.98]She still hasn't responded to anything.
[406:14.40]I don't know what's going on.
[406:15.32]Any ideas?
[406:20.24]Well, first, the first question I have here, are you sure you have the right phone number?
[406:24.60]And are you sure that you are currently dating this person?
[406:30.52]You know, those are two very important questions to ask, right?
[406:34.72]but uh if your girlfriend is not talking to you for two months and you phone well when you say you've been using somebody else to talk to her what does that mean I'm trying to think of how that would make how that would work so somebody somebody is relaying information
[407:04.71]From you to them.
[407:05.87]I would just be like, hey, tell... Tell her to come over.
[407:12.29]So we can figure out what's going on.
[407:15.21]Or... I don't know.
[407:18.22]That's a weird one.
[407:21.68]That doesn't sound very good.
[407:26.02]She's using a friend's phone.
[407:36.16]Maybe he's sending Odie to talk to Arlene.
[407:44.31]God.
[407:45.45]But I really don't have... That's an interesting situation if it's real.
[407:48.69]I don't really have very much advice for you.
[407:50.10]Maybe somebody else can help here.
[407:52.18]Because I don't... That's an odd one for sure.
[407:56.43]But thank you, Garfield.
[407:57.21]Thank you, Rungerton, for the $1.
[407:58.83]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching for almost five years.

[408:59.26]Over 90 degree heat with a bunch of humidity, you may as well just walk outside and your skin is cooking.
[409:12.15]Almost done.
[409:16.33]But thank you, Dr. Picketh.
[409:17.67]Happy fake birthday.
[409:19.80]Zarina, thanks for the $1, Zarina.
[409:21.24]Hey, Jerma, I just wanted to say that it's important that you don't re-chat.
[409:24.60]What?
[409:24.96]You thought this was going to be some helpful message?
[409:27.96]Jerma's son, get the fuck out of here.
[409:33.14]Thank you, Luckybone, for the $10 here.
[409:36.55]Hey, guys, I'm heading to bed.
[409:37.57]Nice stream tonight, Jerma.
[409:38.73]Thank you, Luckybone.
[409:42.06]Have a good rest.
[409:42.94]Thank you for the $10.
[409:43.40]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $1.
[409:46.65]Jerma is thrilled because he is skilled.
[409:50.65]Sometimes.
[409:52.05]Not all the time.
[409:53.23]Sometimes.
[409:54.83]Spreeo, thanks for the $1.
[409:55.83]Hey Jerma, I suggested this before on the Discord, but I want you to consider playing Beyond Good and Evil on the PlayStation 2.
[410:01.88]It looks fun and very creative.
[410:04.06]It could be a really good game to stream.
[410:05.42]Also, the sequel of it is coming soon.
[410:07.60]Have a look on it.
[410:08.72]That is it, I guess.
[410:10.27]I've already played Beyond Good and Evil.
[410:11.80]Not on stream, but I've played it.
[410:12.88]It's an old one.
[410:16.78]But maybe... I don't know.
[410:18.60]I'm not so... I don't know if I want to play one of those games on stream.
[410:20.98]Because it's a long... Action-adventure games like that.
[410:27.15]They're fairly long.
[410:30.17]I don't remember the exact length of Beyond.
[410:31.65]Consider three years and do.
[410:34.95]Beyond Good and Evil came out in like... 2007 or something.
[410:37.43]That's six.
[410:45.14]Jebaited again?
[410:46.35]How did I get jebaited?
[410:47.89]How?
[410:49.63]Because Dark Souls isn't long?
[410:51.81]Yeah, but I find Dark Souls way more interesting than a game like Beyond Good and Evil.
[411:00.40]A lot of random shit can happen in Dark Souls.
[411:02.72]A whole lot of random shit can't happen in a typical action-adventure game.
[411:08.02]There's a lot of interesting scenarios that play out in these FromSoftware games.
[411:18.40]Not everything is about you.
[411:20.66]Oh, I'm sorry.
[411:21.91]I'm sorry.
[411:24.21]Thank you, DarkForce2k, for the 1,000 bits.
[411:26.65]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[411:27.47]Good job, Skeleton.
[411:30.27]Thank you.
[411:31.73]Talking about me?
[411:33.81]Appreciate it.
[411:34.44]Thanks.
[411:36.67]About 32 Nixon's.
[411:37.87]Thank you again for your hundred dollars Much love to you.
[411:41.59]Thank you so much Sparky your hat.
[411:46.19]Thank you for the one dollar handsome streamer.
[411:47.96]Hey, thanks Dr. Sophia, thanks for the one dollar.
[411:52.88]I want thick mommy Jupiter to bury my Wow almost read that one Thank you.
[411:59.14]Dr. Sophia.
[412:00.12]Thank you.
[412:00.52]No soup for you for the five bucks
[412:05.79]I said I'd donate 50 bucks if you first tried Capra.
[412:09.21]Here's your consolation prize.
[412:11.47]Also, this now means that I've donated 100 plus dollars to you, Jerma's son.
[412:17.87]I appreciate every single one of those dollars, man.
[412:22.26]You've been very good to me.
[412:23.44]Thank you.
[412:25.50]Why are the donations so horny tonight?
[412:27.80]I was wrong.
[412:28.28]It is lust.
[412:31.66]The seven deadly chat sin tonight is lust.
[412:34.48]I didn't believe it, and now I do.
[412:39.49]Thank you, Sue.
[412:41.35]Appreciate it, man.
[412:44.09]Snoozycopter, thanks for the $1.
[412:46.93]I don't want you to publish a t-shirt right now.
[412:48.97]I just wanted to show you that I am more than happy to do something for you in the future.
[412:52.68]You can find my business address on the backside of this bit message.
[412:56.40]Anyway, thank you, chat.
[412:59.44]That was a thank you, chat.
[413:02.52]You like the design so much.
[413:03.94]Also, Jerma, love that you're enjoying Dark Souls that much.
[413:08.02]And now for something completely different.
[413:10.82]Monty Python.
[413:13.87]Those bunch of jokesters.
[413:17.01]Jokesters?
[413:18.33]Jokers.
[413:19.99]Why am I adding a T?
[413:25.10]Thank you, Snoopy.
[413:26.68]I will definitely let you know.
[413:30.86]There are a couple of projects that I want to do.
[413:32.80]It's just time and money and
[413:36.61]Sometimes I forget how much time shit actually takes.
[413:40.11]And I have all these ideas that I'd like to develop that kind of require like 10 people to develop them.
[413:48.02]And I forget sometimes I go over my head that I'm just kind of one guy.
[413:52.42]Which again adds to the fact that I want to move to Las Vegas and be able to go to Los Angeles and get a hold of different people and production stuff.
[414:02.07]There's a whole lot of reasons why.
[414:05.78]But I do that a lot, so.
[414:10.52]But thank you, dude.
[414:11.80]Thank you, Sparky, your hat for the $1 Double D Onion Ring Twitch emote.
[414:14.88]When?
[414:16.57]Probably never.
[414:17.25]Thank you, Melchiot.
[414:19.75]Melchiot for the $1.
[414:20.77]Thank you.
[414:22.45]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[414:23.59]Gamer card revoked because you couldn't beat Medeir.
[414:26.96]Neither did you.
[414:28.96]I saw your achievement list on Steam.
[414:30.76]You didn't beat Medeir.
[414:35.64]Add 0.001% if everybody did.
[414:38.56]Nobody even knows a person that beat Medeir.
[414:42.08]I don't know one, do you?
[414:50.48]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[414:52.03]Apparently I'm an ass for hating chat.
[414:55.01]Feels bad, man.
[414:56.83]No, I'm just kidding.
[414:59.95]Chat can be very unruly sometimes.
[415:01.85]Like an unruly baby.
[415:04.12]Pick me up!
[415:04.72]Put me down!
[415:06.01]Feed me!
[415:06.99]I wanna play with this!
[415:07.69]I wanna play with that!
[415:08.41]No, that's MY toy!
[415:09.53]It can happen.
[415:09.99]The Twitch chat is either extremely mature, the unruly baby, or one of the seven deadly sins.
[415:19.53]Sometimes they're a combination of both.
[415:24.40]Sometimes they're a very wrathful baby.
[415:28.02]You know?
[415:29.40]It happens sometimes.
[415:32.09]I've seen some really, really... Okay.
[415:48.36]Let's go ahead and move on.
[415:52.03]To Prime Vino.
[415:54.55]Thank you, Prime Vino.
[415:56.58]Last night, I went to Dunkin Donuts and started to eat all the donuts.
[415:59.64]I continued to do so while the employees yelled at me to stop.
[416:02.32]After the 13th donut, I threw up on the counter.
[416:04.37]What are you talking about?
[416:08.75]Oh, I'm tired.
[416:10.21]That just made me laugh.
[416:11.65]I was just so confused by that whole entire string of events.
[416:15.18]Thank you, Prime Vino, for the $1.
[416:16.98]Thank you, Lord Cameleus, for the $1.
[416:18.56]Go back and kill him on stream or I'm revoking your gamer license.
[416:22.58]No, I'm not going to kill Medir on stream.
[416:25.06]I haven't played Dark Souls 3 since the last time you saw me play it.
[416:28.16]I'm not going to jump into the hardest boss in the whole series.
[416:34.16]I still don't know what to do with this.
[416:35.12]Nobody does.
[416:35.42]I don't either.
[416:35.78]No.
[416:35.84]You've seen me lash out against chat before.
[416:36.96]What are you talking about?
[417:04.06]We all have our days, right?
[417:08.76]I've lashed out at chat a few times over my streaming career.
[417:13.14]Don't worry, it's alright.
[417:18.90]It's all good.
[417:21.76]These kinds of streams are a joy.
[417:22.72]Thank you, Germanboy.
[417:34.95]Somebody just put career in quotes.
[417:41.39]What else should I call it?
[417:45.79]My goddamn career, okay?
[417:49.83]I am going to be a twitch.tv online personality until I'm 66.
[417:54.94]Because that's a retirement year.
[417:58.04]And everything is going to stream in retirement.
[418:05.13]Office.
[418:06.11]It's an office.
[418:08.51]It's a studio.
[418:11.63]What do you want me to say?
[418:14.31]In this room that I'm currently in where I stream and make videos... What do you want me to call this room?
[418:25.16]What do I call this room?
[418:28.26]I painted in here.
[418:30.72]Me and Italic's painted in here.
[418:32.44]That's a studio.
[418:39.58]A meme closet.
[418:40.96]A meme room.
[418:43.70]It's a joke studio.
[418:45.94]A stream hole.
[418:47.24]Come.
[418:50.47]I like stream hole, actually.
[418:51.89]That's a good one.
[418:55.47]But thank you, WilderBuddy.
[418:56.43]And last two here.
[418:57.21]Thank you, Emine762, for the $1.
[418:58.89]I'm going to my first full-time job as a mechanic tomorrow.
[419:03.93]Thanks for all the laughs and helping me calm my nerves.
[419:06.14]Yeah.
[419:08.92]Good luck.
[419:09.90]Never mind.
[419:12.93]Sounds like a pretty promising career.
[419:14.59]Promising job you got.
[419:16.65]Hopefully you do well.
[419:18.47]You will.
[419:18.91]Don't you?
[419:19.29]You will.
[419:19.65]You already know you will.
[419:22.67]You're gonna do great.
[419:23.77]Don't worry.
[419:25.88]And finally, hey Melon, thanks for the one dollar.
[419:27.96]They say seems good.
[419:30.08]And that's gonna be it.
[419:32.68]Thank you so much everybody for hanging out.
[419:36.78]Just at the seven hour mark.
[419:38.04]Look at that.
[419:39.72]Am I going to TwitchCon?
[419:42.27]I don't know.
[419:43.71]It depends on how the move goes.
[419:46.07]If I'm not settled into Las Vegas, then I might not be able to go.
[419:55.98]Possibly.
[419:57.16]I'm leaving it open.
[420:00.18]But take care, everybody.
[420:01.12]See you guys on Tuesday.
[420:02.52]More Dark Souls Remastered.
[420:06.10]Sayonara.
[420:07.96]See you soon.
[420:22.55]you
