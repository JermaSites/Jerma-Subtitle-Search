[00:02.63]Hi.
[00:05.55]Hope you're doing well.
[00:06.47]Sorry for starting late.
[00:09.13]We had some multiplayer issues.
[00:12.71]We were just sitting here figuring it out.
[00:13.94]I think we figured it out.
[00:14.90]We're good.
[00:20.20]Thankfully, it didn't take too long.
[00:22.52]But we kept on getting disconnected to each other.
[00:25.16]Had to try some... Okay, well... Hey, ladies and gentlemen, there he is.
[00:30.76]Boop.
[00:33.22]Ladies and gentlemen, there he is.
[00:34.58]Hello.
[00:35.10]Hello.
[00:35.69]Hello.
[00:36.27]Hello.
[00:36.89]Hello.
[00:37.67]No.
[00:38.99]No.
[00:39.95]Hello.
[00:40.17]Alright.
[00:40.71]Well, let's mute this.
[00:41.35]Let's mute him so I can do my intro.
[00:43.57]That was very loud.
[00:44.87]Did you just drive by?
[00:46.71]Was that you?
[00:47.83]That was me.
[00:48.59]Alright.
[00:48.89]Give me a second.
[00:50.43]Give me a second.
[00:51.19]God.
[00:53.06]But yeah, we're going to play some Moterari.
[00:54.52]We just pick up right where we left off last week.
[00:58.56]Continuing the training session.
[01:02.20]Oh, I didn't mute on his side.
[01:03.90]Sorry, dude.
[01:07.55]Alright.
[01:15.95]Oh, and you guys didn't hear what he just said.
[01:18.32]So I'm, like, on both ends.
[01:21.14]I'm talking to you, and they don't hear you.
[01:22.84]And then I was talking to them, and you don't hear me.
[01:25.02]You know what I mean?
[01:25.50]Like, I just ruined that whole thing.
[01:26.84]Is this your first time?
[01:29.93]Uh... First time streaming?
[01:33.09]375th or something like that, I think.
[01:34.73]Oh, okay.
[01:35.31]Well, um... It'll get better.
[01:37.55]Alright, we don't even need an intro.
[01:38.99]We're already here.
[01:40.48]So we're starting late, so let's go.
[01:41.74]For those of you that don't know what Terraria is, it's a base-building block exploration game.
[01:48.58]Where, I know, and that... Let's go.
[01:51.06]It's 2D Minecraft.
[01:52.38]You guys ever play Minecraft?
[01:55.51]When's the Minecraft stream, Jerma?
[01:57.33]I already did it.
[01:59.18]Did you?
[02:00.42]Yeah!
[02:01.38]Dude, you're a trending gamer.
[02:03.20]You know, dude, I've played Minecraft like six times in the last, like, three years.
[02:07.32]I think you need a new playthrough.
[02:13.98]I will never do a playthrough of Minecraft.
[02:17.18]Again.
[02:19.23]I might open it and like fall down into lava once or twice for like a couple hours.
[02:25.33]Build a dirt house, but I'm not gonna do like a full playthrough.
[02:28.44]You know, it would take a million to beat the ender dragon I Mean it would take a million dollars.
[02:33.02]I'll do it Wow Wow Okay, so play Terraria he wants a million, okay, why do you think I've been now I got a nice fat check for Mr.. Ster I
[02:50.42]Hey, I'm gonna invite you to the squad stream because my chat's telling me to do it.
[02:55.65]Oh, did you stream on?
[02:57.91]Yeah, it's been on.
[02:58.81]Don't let this be, like, last time where you didn't think I was streaming for, like, four hours.
[03:02.39]No, I knew you.
[03:03.01]I knew you were streaming.
[03:04.61]I mean, I... You just, like, want to squad up, apparently.
[03:15.33]That's what they want.
[03:16.84]so where we last left off hey we're not in hard mode yet we haven't killed the wall we were in the dungeon and um but we want to do before we kill the wall and the last thing we were going to do is get you that sick new summoner armor step that's right do that we need to uh go get some water candles from the dungeon hey Jerma left the game no I didn't
[03:41.16]And it said you left.
[03:42.76]So, uh, maybe we can do this rejoin-join, uh, thing for again?
[03:46.80]For, like, another 20 minutes?
[03:49.20]Alright!
[03:50.46]Hey!
[03:51.88]Sweet!
[03:53.56]Everybody watching, you all missed it, but, you know, we rejoined and tried to join each other and talked about how dogshit Steam is for, like, 20 minutes.
[04:01.51]So we can do it all again.
[04:02.59]Alright.
[04:07.35]Pretty good.
[04:08.41]Pretty good stuff.
[04:11.22]Alright, um, hold on.
[04:13.18]So, you want to try this, uh... Try this again?
[04:18.38]Yeah, oh yeah, I have to invite you.
[04:19.94]Uh, okay.
[04:25.14]Hello?
[04:25.88]Who do I watch, Jerma or Stora?
[04:27.26]You can see both, with the squad stream.
[04:30.02]Hello?
[04:30.42]Okay, you gonna invite?
[04:33.26]I did.
[04:34.06]This did this last time, though.
[04:35.20]Do you remember?
[04:35.62]This did this last time.
[04:37.20]It did.
[04:37.48]It did, and then it was fine.
[04:39.38]But, like, you need to be able to rejoin.
[04:42.32]Hopefully I can.
[04:43.12]And I can.
[04:43.62]I'm here.
[04:44.40]So let's hope that that... This is just like what happens when you play Terraria.
[04:47.64]Yeah, okay.
[04:48.42]It's the first time.
[04:49.24]First time, Jitters, the game was nervous.
[04:52.08]Alright, you ready?
[04:53.70]I'm ready.
[04:55.78]There's one... Okay, okay, okay.
[04:57.55]Before we go, while it's night time, we're gonna end up needing demonite bars, so we're gonna have to kill a boss that drops demonite bars.
[05:06.19]Demonite bars.
[05:06.93]Okay.
[05:09.78]Yeah, I think we can just kill the eye.
[05:11.16]How many bars do we need?
[05:16.02]A bit.
[05:16.86]I think we might have to kill it twice, and then we can walk to the dungeon.
[05:20.88]Where's it going?
[05:21.92]You can remember how to play.
[05:23.48]I know how to play.
[05:25.80]Well, you want it to refresh her.
[05:27.02]You know, this is just like a reminder, everyone.
[05:29.58]Welcome back.
[05:31.40]We're the guys.
[05:32.88]I'm melting him right now.
[05:34.36]I'm melting him right now.
[05:45.37]I'm hit.
[05:46.21]I took a hit.
[05:48.40]I took a few hits.
[05:49.16]I took like six hits.
[05:50.10]Alright, we're good.
[05:52.58]Okay, we're good.
[05:53.74]How many bars?
[05:55.96]Uh, it gives ore, so I don't know.
[05:57.40]Why is it two?
[05:58.96]I made another one.
[05:59.76]We're gonna need another one.
[06:02.10]Because I used all of our demonite bars to make storage.
[06:07.89]You get hit?
[06:09.43]I got hit.
[06:09.79]He's killing our guy.
[06:10.71]Why can't he go in there?
[06:13.11]There's a wall.
[06:15.13]he doesn't give a shit oh good job now he dropped all of his things in there and they're mine and you can't have them that's a dated reference what what did I do for a dated reference what did I do what did I say I don't know uh but that's probably enough do you have enough bars
[06:46.89]Uh, we will, but we have to go to the dungeon and get, uh, water candles.
[06:52.48]You said, can I has cheeseburger?
[06:56.04]I did not say that.
[06:58.44]Here, take this, take that, take that.
[07:00.79]Don't, like, deep fake that shit on me.
[07:02.67]Alright, I got it.
[07:04.43]And that's a charm, so...
[07:06.75]Don't call him J. That's my mom's name.
[07:09.93]What?
[07:10.87]That's true.
[07:11.49]Actually, he's J9 to 5.
[07:13.09]Alright, what is this?
[07:14.65]This is the one with the minions, right?
[07:18.01]Yeah.
[07:19.04]Don't I have a double jump right now and don't I need that because I'm on training wheels?
[07:22.30]You do.
[07:23.18]You're on training wheels, yes.
[07:24.34]So when we come back, I'll make you the full set and then you'll wear the full set.
[07:29.98]But for now, double jump's pretty good.
[07:32.38]Double jump is important for somebody that's on training wheels.
[07:35.05]Oh, dude, he's selling a kimono.
[07:36.59]Oh, I thought that was a bee.
[07:39.17]What does he got?
[07:40.67]He's selling a kimono.
[07:45.13]You could just call me Jeremy.
[07:47.61]You know?
[07:49.87]Yeah, right.
[07:50.93]Okay, I'm going to store some things and we're going.
[07:55.51]You sure?
[07:57.07]Yeah.
[07:59.07]I have three bananas.
[07:59.93]What do you do with these?
[08:01.71]You can have them.
[08:06.04]I hate you.
[08:09.34]Oh, I think I killed somebody.
[08:10.41]Oops.
[08:13.05]That's just... That's how it is out here.
[08:14.55]What is this?
[08:15.19]Did we make this?
[08:17.01]Who made this?
[08:17.65]Yeah, that's my... I don't want to tell you what that is.
[08:20.00]Let's go.
[08:20.40]Alright, I'm going.
[08:24.50]So do you eventually get, like, speed increases?
[08:26.94]Like, times two speed?
[08:28.30]Or extra speed?
[08:29.44]Or...
[08:30.20]You get boots that let you sprint.
[08:31.98]You get wings that let you fly and move faster.
[08:35.52]You can also, right now, you should have the hook, right?
[08:37.86]I gave you a hook.
[08:39.30]If you hook the ground, it'll, like, pull you towards it a lot faster than your move speed.
[08:46.97]That's really cool.
[08:49.41]You technically could lay down wire all the way across the map to build a teleporter.
[08:54.73]Or...
[08:58.05]You can make, like, minecart tracks.
[09:00.29]Wait, wait.
[09:01.01]Am I going the right way?
[09:01.91]We're not even in the same party.
[09:04.79]Yeah, you're going the right way.
[09:05.97]Wait, you can open.
[09:07.65]Yeah, okay.
[09:10.77]Did I miss anything?
[09:11.97]No.
[09:15.41]This is our first time playing together in four years.
[09:22.81]I didn't think he would talk to me again, but here we are.

[09:29.30]You know.
[09:31.38]The money?
[09:32.58]Oh, right.
[09:35.86]The money.
[09:36.42]The scandal?
[09:37.66]The money?
[09:38.31]It was, uh, you didn't say it.
[09:40.23]You've already forgotten about the money?
[09:41.61]I never forget.
[09:46.07]I never forget about the money.

[12:21.92]It's disgusting.
[12:23.14]Shh, don't tell him.

[15:23.42]I'm gonna go get my 47 gold on table.
[15:28.60]So I can have two extra suns.
[15:31.17]Killing enemies or continually damaging bosses generates soul wisps.
[15:36.39]After generating five wisps, they are instantly consumed to heal you for 10 health.
[15:41.16]That's actually pretty great.
[15:42.68]That's really cool.
[15:45.76]Alright, nice.

[15:47.76]Let's see.
[15:50.06]Remember to touch the table.
[15:52.20]It's not suns, it's summons.
[15:54.06]So your... Your bird?
[15:57.39]I don't remember what you had.
[15:58.33]The dank creeper, perhaps?
[16:00.53]How do I stop being a squirrel?
[16:03.15]R. Okay, thank you.
[16:08.19]Alright, so let's see.
[16:10.88]No, this doesn't count as a summon?
[16:12.06]No.
[16:13.19]No.
[16:14.28]That is a sentry.
[16:17.22]The boys that follow you.
[16:18.46]Damn it.
[16:19.24]Okay.
[16:20.58]What about these?
[16:21.20]Are these some... Alright.
[16:22.08]There we go.
[16:24.34]No.
[16:24.60]Never mind.
[16:25.18]You can only have two of those.
[16:25.92]That's the sentry too.
[16:28.04]I'm sentry guy, not summon guy, right?
[16:30.28]No.
[16:30.72]What?
[16:32.28]Are you doing the clouds?
[16:34.37]Dude, I'm going to have to tell you something right now.
[16:36.53]I threw away the other ones.
[16:43.09]I don't think I have those anymore.
[16:44.53]No, no, no, no, no.
[16:47.19]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16:48.78]They're in here.
[16:52.40]He's being quiet because he's very upset.
[16:54.38]Hold on.
[16:54.70]There we go.
[16:55.02]Wait, wait, wait.
[16:55.52]I'm thinking like, do I run back to town?
[16:57.70]Do I run back to our base and hit him?
[16:59.48]Or do I get the gold?
[17:02.94]Alright, so that's... Shadow Drop Staff is one of them.
[17:06.04]And then... You can only have one type of summon out at any point anyways, right?
[17:10.34]You can have more than one type.
[17:12.68]Okay, so your pants, your armor, and your helmet give a summon.
[17:16.13]And you have one by default, so you should be able to have four summons.
[17:18.99]Okay, cool.
[17:21.25]And then you touch the Bewitching Table and you get five.
[17:23.41]Alright, so... I definitely... I definitely threw away...
[17:31.33]Someone's a dog.
[17:31.87]Dank Creeper.
[17:32.51]Okay, hold on.
[17:33.96]That's the good one.
[17:35.50]Oh, someone's a dark aura rain from the sky.
[17:37.48]No, no, no.
[17:37.96]That's not a summon.
[17:38.54]Not that.
[17:40.84]Fire is a storm.
[17:41.80]Okay.
[17:42.36]That's the one.
[17:42.78]Creeper.
[17:43.62]That's the one.
[17:44.04]Alright.
[17:47.94]Proud of you.
[17:49.14]Alright.
[17:51.24]So, let me go check it out.
[17:51.76]You're doing real well.
[17:52.30]Let's see what it does.
[17:59.01]So I can have three.
[17:59.97]Okay, that's pretty ridiculous.
[18:01.17]I can have three of these out at the same time.
[18:04.81]Why am I so slow?
[18:06.59]It should give you five.
[18:08.10]Five?
[18:09.78]It's not giving me five.
[18:10.80]It's three.
[18:12.06]Four with the table.
[18:13.38]Right.
[18:15.12]How do I activate the table?
[18:17.52]Right click the table.
[18:18.96]Unless I just didn't read the helmet.
[18:23.37]No, you didn't read it right.
[18:24.29]It's four with the table.
[18:25.87]Okay.
[18:26.63]Alright.
[18:27.48]I'm ready to be a guy that just walks around and lets other things do everything for him.
[18:33.26]Um... Well... Wait, the owl might be taking a summon slot.
[18:36.82]How do I get the owl to leave?
[18:38.89]The owl shouldn't be doing that.
[18:40.93]It's a pet.
[18:41.93]Which... No, no, no.
[18:43.37]I highly doubt it.
[18:44.85]The helmet is minion damage, not summon minion.
[18:48.83]Okay.
[18:49.17]The two other pieces are extra minion.
[18:51.61]The helm is 10% more damage.
[18:53.94]Alright.
[18:54.78]So, where you at?
[18:55.38]Where you at?
[18:57.49]Um, I'm grabbing the 47 gold that I dropped.
[19:00.05]So I'm going to go do that.
[19:02.11]Oh, I don't have to double jump anymore.
[19:05.57]Oh, I'm not paying attention, chat.
[19:10.86]So as I was saying, the last time we were playing, you were talking about how you wanted to know more about what you're doing.
[19:16.36]You said you were going to do some reading.
[19:17.52]Did you do any reading?
[19:21.10]No.
[19:22.46]Okay.
[19:23.64]Um...
[19:26.03]So what would you like to do?
[19:28.07]I haven't had time.
[19:28.97]I haven't had time.
[19:29.95]I can give you options.
[19:30.67]Alright, I would like to do a boss.
[19:38.83]Okay, here's a couple of things that can be done.
[19:43.15]You can actually change the server to expert mode, and bosses drop more things on expert mode that you can only get in expert mode, and then we can kill bosses we've already done.
[19:53.59]Um, I think there's two more bosses for the mods that we can do.
[19:58.67]I have to double check which ones they are.
[20:00.55]I forget what we haven't done.
[20:04.31]And we can do the Wall of Flesh, which is a big deal because after that, the game goes into hard mode.
[20:10.69]Oh, okay.
[20:13.45]My guys can't get in here?
[20:16.72]I'm just kind of doing a little bit of exploring.
[20:22.51]Okay, so none of those options.
[20:25.01]No, I was just going to do a lunch.
[20:26.27]Alright, you pretty much just spoke a different language for 30 straight seconds.
[20:30.17]Whatever you want to do, whatever you think would be the most interesting and more like the most fun.
[20:35.72]You were talking about like how you wanted to read up, you wanted to go in order, you wanted to make sure you weren't doing anything and understand what we were doing.
[20:42.88]No, I know what we're doing.
[20:44.88]What are we doing?
[20:46.10]We're doing the Wall of Flesh.
[20:47.12]It's hard mode.
[20:47.74]It's like Diablo.
[20:48.56]You level up to a different difficulty.
[20:50.66]But there's a couple of bosses before the Wall of Flesh that we'll technically skip if we do the Wall of Flesh.
[20:54.49]We can come back and do them later, but we're probably never going to do that.
[20:56.97]So do you want to do those before we do the Wall of Flesh?
[20:59.11]Sure.
[20:59.41]That sounds like fun.
[20:59.87]Okay.
[21:03.03]I need a second to check what we haven't done.
[21:07.34]We didn't do the Star Scouter.
[21:09.70]And we did not do... Slime God.
[21:14.46]Slime God?
[21:23.24]Is that, what's the slime god?
[21:26.37]Oh, because we never found the meteorite.
[21:28.89]I think we have to walk left and find the meteorite, and then we can do the starcaller thingy.
[21:33.27]Okay.
[21:34.45]And slime god is, it's just two big slimes at once, but it drops some good stuff.
[21:43.58]Exploring caves is a lot more fun than just, and more productive than digging.
[21:49.88]Oh, okay.
[21:54.07]Is someone king shaming you?
[21:57.29]No, they're saying that don't like dig, go find a cave.
[21:59.77]Digging is like not productive to go like find stuff.
[22:04.43]But what if you wanted to dig?
[22:05.77]I thought you wanted to dig.
[22:06.69]You must have wanted to dig.
[22:07.75]I don't know, but I'm putting a lot of fucking torches down.
[22:11.46]It's because I'm holding shift.
[22:13.94]It's because I'm holding shift to like do the thing where you can just automatically change to whatever.
[22:18.06]What the hell was that?
[22:22.76]Give me these back.
[22:30.52]There was a present out here.
[22:32.69]Oh, I love presents.
[22:36.01]Okay.
[22:36.37]So, we need to go left.
[22:38.61]Yeah, I'm at the meteor.
[22:39.81]I'm mining meteorite right now.
[22:41.31]That's what I'm doing.
[22:41.97]I'm just coming over here.
[22:43.53]You're at the meteor now?
[22:45.35]Yeah.
[22:47.25]Let me touch the thing.
[22:48.21]Oh, I got the little globes around me.
[22:49.99]I'm going to get so confused.
[22:53.11]Can you buy... Yes.
[22:58.09]Dynamite before you come here.
[23:01.25]Uh, how much do you want?
[23:01.89]I don't know.
[23:05.22]Like, 20?
[23:11.64]What did you... I just opened the present, and then... Alright, you want 20 dynamite.
[23:16.30]Yeah.
[23:24.12]There might even be some in the box.
[23:26.20]How does one sound?
[23:29.46]How do I only have enough money for one?
[23:32.74]You can search in the box and see if there's gold.
[23:35.34]Search for gold.
[23:36.86]Search for dynamite.
[23:37.89]Search for bombs.
[23:38.83]Bombs would be good enough.
[23:40.65]Okay.
[23:41.09]There's no dynamite in here.
[23:42.27]Bomb.
[23:43.67]No bombs in here.
[23:44.81]Nope.
[23:45.45]I'm an idiot.
[23:47.91]I don't want to filter weapons.
[23:49.01]Filter all.
[23:51.47]No dynamite.
[23:53.25]There are bombs in here, though.
[23:55.23]I will buy some... I'm gonna buy whatever I can buy with this.
[23:59.67]You wanted... Guys, what's happening right now?
[24:08.67]20 silver.
[24:09.93]Why can't I... Okay.
[24:10.83]Alright, I got 11 dynamite and 12 bombs.
[24:16.73]okay you're gonna wanna you're gonna wanna come to me now I'm on the way and then you can participate good I love these things this is so cool uh where exactly did you why did you dig over here
[24:44.80]What?
[24:45.50]Stop asking me dumb questions.
[24:47.90]What did you do over here?
[24:52.48]Did we do this?
[24:53.10]I don't remember doing this.
[24:54.74]I can't see you.
[24:55.76]We're squad streaming.
[24:57.02]You can see what I'm doing.
[24:57.94]Just look at the squad window.
[24:59.54]That's a natural hole.
[25:00.38]That's why chat was telling you it's not productive because that's natural.
[25:03.22]It's just a hole.
[25:09.46]They exist.
[25:12.76]How are you doing on mana?
[25:14.08]Do you need like mana stones?
[25:15.40]Whatever the hell these things are.
[25:17.80]I think I still need like a few because I have three.
[25:22.36]Wow.
[25:24.32]Someone's been holding out.
[25:30.09]I like my little flare gun though.
[25:32.15]It makes me able to see what I'm doing.
[25:40.47]Alright, buddy boy.
[25:41.39]Alright, let's go.
[25:43.94]This is Meteor.
[25:44.88]This is the Meteor.
[25:45.80]You don't stand on the Meteor because it burns you if you stand on it.
[25:48.96]Okay, so that's why you want to die on it.
[25:50.52]So you just chuck some bombs down there.
[25:52.58]You want me just to start throwing Dynamite down there?
[25:55.67]Yeah, just throw a Dynamite, you know, throw some bombs.
[25:58.11]The goal is to get the Meteorite.
[25:59.55]Does Dynamite stand up in this game, or does it fly?
[26:03.65]Okay, some games Dynamite stands right up.
[26:05.98]Wait, ow.
[26:12.00]Alright.
[26:12.32]What do you mean it stands up?
[26:13.70]They just don't like flat.
[26:16.20]Oh, like you place it on the ground.
[26:17.44]Yeah, I know.
[26:18.12]I mean, I thought you were insane, but I get it.
[26:20.24]How far down does this go?
[26:22.80]Stop.
[26:23.94]You see like the brown rocks that are flaming.
[26:26.00]Alright.
[26:26.44]That's the meteor.
[26:26.94]I'm going to get it in there.
[26:28.04]See if I can get it in one.
[26:30.44]This is kind of like a pinball game.
[26:33.54]Well, you see, like you could just drop it over here now.
[26:37.50]Oops!
[26:38.14]I'm fine.
[26:38.48]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[26:41.48]Alright, watch out.
[26:46.23]How far was it?
[26:46.71]What's a blast rate?
[26:48.33]I just told you I was throwing one.
[26:52.45]This is a lot.
[26:53.11]So what do you... Do you, like, craft barcodes?
[26:56.80]Yeah, we don't really need much more.
[27:00.81]How do we get it?
[27:01.51]Also, we need to be we need meteorite to summon the boss.
[27:04.35]Oh, OK.
[27:05.33]That we were going to do.
[27:06.05]Do you want more than that or is that enough?
[27:08.74]This will be enough.
[27:14.50]Why is that shooting at you?
[27:15.30]I don't know.
[27:20.12]I think it's on drugs.
[27:21.77]Might be.
[27:23.77]OK, so yeah, that's 300 meteorite.
[27:26.01]We're good.
[27:26.61]We're good.
[27:27.11]Go back.
[27:27.69]Go back.
[27:35.40]What do I have?
[27:35.86]Let me look at my stuff.
[27:37.76]Sticky bomb, that's cool.
[27:39.90]Sticky dynamite?
[27:43.37]It's combining dynamite with gel, so when you throw it, it sticks to things.
[27:46.43]Oh, that's cool.
[27:50.05]Alright, I got a goodie bag.
[27:52.05]Also, I can, wait... Bat hook?
[27:58.83]Oh, here, take these.
[28:00.16]These won't break if I throw them to you, right?
[28:01.58]The stars?
[28:03.49]It's nighttime, so you can't... Alright.
[28:08.69]I'm puzzled off.
[28:11.41]Do you want this Ancient Shiv?
[28:13.11]35 melee damage, 4% crit, very fast attack speed, average knockback material, enemies release a blue aura, cloud on death.
[28:18.79]No.
[28:20.13]Sell it.
[28:22.15]Who has the most money in here?
[28:25.37]They all just give you money.
[28:26.83]They don't have a bank.
[28:31.93]Too much...
[28:33.66]It's pretty much like Fallout.
[28:36.14]Alright, so... On the left side for me is like default characters.
[28:41.35]I know pretty much what all these do.
[28:43.39]You added like two expansions to this game, and I don't know what any of this is.
[28:49.91]Here's the important ones.
[28:50.89]Fae, the Dryad.
[28:54.48]sells boss summon items generally for bosses you've already beaten okay so she helps cool uh Paul Paul's nobody alright well let's summon them and he doesn't have the thing I was looking for so you want to summon the boss hold on oh this guy's boss has summons as well
[29:23.53]uh we have to go up to the skybox like we can only summon this boss up in the really the tops yeah I actually don't know how hard this boss is or what it does uh well that's good to know we're prepared I know that we need platforms
[29:50.49]We're going to need to build platforms up here so we can actually move.
[29:52.85]Do you have enough wood for that or do we need to go get it?
[29:56.43]I think it's in the box.
[29:58.95]Alright, well, I'll be up here.
[30:01.63]Okay.
[30:03.72]Hope you're having a good time.
[30:04.64]Hope you're having a good day.
[30:07.32]I'm having a good day.
[30:08.12]I hope you had a really good drink.
[30:11.20]A good drink?
[30:12.68]Yeah.
[30:13.96]Well... Just, like, treat it yourself with a beverage.
[30:16.54]You know what I'm talking about?
[30:17.60]Who's this person?
[30:18.20]Why is there, like, a lady up here?
[30:21.37]I should have a lot of health.
[30:23.27]Hag?
[30:25.27]Where the hell am I?
[30:31.52]Yes.
[30:38.08]Alright, you coming?
[30:41.48]Oh, it's because the gravity changed.
[30:42.94]Okay, that's cool.
[30:51.63]My health?
[30:52.21]What's wrong with my health?
[30:52.81]Jerma has an activated squad stream.
[30:55.07]Oh, that's my bad.
[30:57.13]I accepted the invite.
[30:58.43]Yeah, he joined.
[30:59.19]Okay, I activated it.
[31:00.24]It's live now.
[31:01.26]Oh, no, I did it.
[31:02.64]Yeah, yeah, I'm saying it's my fault.
[31:03.96]Did you not hear me?
[31:06.42]Dude, you got like such a cover because no matter what happens if something wrong goes if something goes wrong It's you could always be like well germans are fucking stupid idiot You have you have like such insurance when you like do anything with me it seems And you know if I wouldn't have that if you had a little bit more confidence A little bit of self-respect and you can be like no
[31:30.58]You could literally throw a baseball through your window right now.
[31:33.62]And it would just... And be like, Jerma, you fucking left the thing over here.
[31:38.49]You left the window unlocked.
[31:40.13]And you were cleaning the window and it dropped.
[31:42.01]And people would believe you.
[31:42.73]And it'd be like, what did I do?
[31:45.54]I didn't do anything.
[31:54.06]I said, how big does this platform have to be?
[31:56.80]I'm just doing it.
[31:58.26]Just protect me.
[31:59.12]Summon your sentry thing.
[32:00.40]They're everywhere.
[32:01.80]No, your fucking auto-shoot sun.
[32:04.35]Oh, you mean this thing?
[32:05.01]Yeah.
[32:06.69]Don't forget you have a sun.
[32:11.73]See, this is all your fucking fault.
[32:21.98]Oh, fuck, man.
[32:22.60]Like, I brought my car in to get repaired, and I need, like, a new gasket?
[32:28.97]Jerma, like, what the fuck, man?
[32:31.17]Like, you should have been in the server faster.
[32:34.07]What happened?
[32:35.01]I'm stupid, man.
[32:37.13]Usually I just blame Ronnie.
[32:38.60]This guy is so, like, oblivious and selfish that he made me buy, like, seven different cables to fix a computer problem.
[32:46.52]Like, I trusted him when he took advantage of me.
[32:48.88]And I ended up buying, like, seven cables.
[32:57.19]Okay, I'm summoning a boss.
[32:58.15]Alright, where are you gonna summon it?
[33:01.54]Where I am.
[33:02.26]You just summon it and then it comes to you.
[33:08.76]I'm getting my ass kicked.
[33:09.68]I'm worried.
[33:11.79]What?
[33:15.47]The ship's shooting us from underneath.
[33:20.11]Whoa.
[33:20.41]That came out of nowhere.
[33:26.13]Okay.
[33:27.59]I don't know what it does.
[33:28.45]It's not doing anything.
[33:31.87]What is he doing?
[33:32.75]How do I do this?
[33:33.99]Oh my god.
[33:34.47]Okay, you're going to jump over that apparently.
[33:38.25]Why is he focusing on me?
[33:41.10]You know, honestly, you're probably dealing so much more damage than me.
[33:45.78]Oh, I'm speaking of dying.
[33:51.02]You can use your mirror.
[33:51.88]Go back to town.
[33:58.88]I picked up my stupid pickaxe.
[34:04.14]Where the... Oh my god.
[34:05.30]Where the fuck is our healer?
[34:06.70]Do we... Oh, she's right there.
[34:12.82]How do I... How do I respawn?
[34:15.94]Oh.
[34:19.64]That didn't go so well.
[34:20.95]Is he dead?
[34:23.25]He might have left.
[34:26.63]No, wait.
[34:27.21]Hold on.
[34:31.38]Oh, respawn time increases.
[34:32.18]What's your max health?
[34:34.16]160.
[34:36.33]Yeah, we're pretty low.
[34:37.89]We should be a lot higher right now.
[34:46.81]How much higher do we need to be?
[34:49.43]We could be at 300.
[34:50.29]Oh.
[34:50.53]That sounds pretty important.
[34:55.29]Yeah, it does.
[34:56.29]Should I wait for you?
[34:59.55]It still shows his health bar, so I don't... Is he just hanging out up here?
[35:04.53]He shouldn't be.
[35:05.29]Yeah, I don't know.
[35:11.29]Let's go find health.
[35:12.93]How about that?
[35:13.53]Is that... No.
[35:23.79]What's with the... Topaz.

[37:02.16]Oh shit.
[37:02.72]It's the fucking, the prophecy.
[37:10.06]He's not gonna kill her.
[37:10.92]He's gonna kill everybody!
[37:12.22]He just goes, killed no old man.
[37:18.07]Why are you not reacting to this?
[37:20.25]I feel like you would be fucking freaking out right now.
[37:23.33]Are we in the same game?
[37:24.33]Am I muted?
[37:27.97]Yes, you've been muted for like... I think I was muted.

[37:34.52]Alright, Calvin has one sliver of health.
[37:36.64]He's gonna die if you...
[37:38.48]Yeah, I was trying to give some advice and some tips and some technique.
[37:43.48]What happened?
[37:44.55]I was breaking into somebody's house and he just spawned on me.
[37:48.95]Well, that's what's weird.
[37:50.41]He still has a health bar.
[37:55.21]So he's somewhere.
[37:56.19]Alright, let's go find him.
[38:00.75]He just appears.
[38:02.41]This is so scary.
[38:03.85]It's like... I feel like it's fucking Mr. X.
[38:10.19]By the way, did you ever play the new Resident Evil 2 remake?
[38:12.99]Uh, I watched a lot of it.
[38:15.59]I didn't play it myself.
[38:16.45]That's probably one of the best games of the year.
[38:22.62]Oh, shit.
[38:24.40]You mean it's one of the best games of ten years ago?
[38:28.76]Well, yeah.
[38:32.72]Because Capcom hit a hard spot and couldn't make new games anymore.
[38:37.49]So the new stride is just to make old stuff again.
[38:41.49]He's on me.
[38:57.41]I'm dead.
[39:00.15]I was gonna teleport and I didn't.
[39:03.35]He's just juggling me right now.
[39:05.21]I'm dead.
[39:08.09]Why don't you just kill it, Jerma?
[39:09.25]Come on.
[39:09.73]Fuck, dude.
[39:10.57]You're the strong one.
[39:11.93]I made you the armor.
[39:13.34]You got the summons.
[39:14.46]You have the sentry.
[39:16.06]You have all the good stuff.
[39:17.10]You take all the fucking good gear.
[39:18.66]He just juggled me.
[39:20.07]He just juggled me.
[39:20.91]He just juggled me in the air.
[39:23.55]Hey, don't even give me this kind of shit.
[39:25.99]You've got, like, a guy on training wheels here.
[39:28.83]And we're, like, 100% less health than we would need to be.
[39:33.98]And you just... Alright, yeah.
[39:37.14]You just put me in armor.
[39:38.66]You have better attack damage because you have all the summons.
[39:43.35]I've given you everything.
[39:44.29]Alright, you can't put, like, a toddler in fucking, like, gold armor.
[39:52.41]Give him a sword and say, alright, I gave you all this really cool stuff.
[39:58.69]You're like really, look at how shiny that armor is.
[40:02.01]Why have you not killed the other king yet?
[40:05.99]What?
[40:11.55]But can't you?
[40:15.70]Toddler screamer.
[40:16.50]Yeah, in the game, in the game.
[40:17.96]I still am just like a baby in this game.
[40:20.50]Okay, well, the boss is somewhere with, like, 7% health.
[40:24.34]Just say sliver.
[40:25.06]It's, like, a cooler, like, more, like, cooler vocabulary.
[40:29.07]He's one.
[40:30.21]He's one!
[40:30.73]He's lit.
[40:36.37]Where is he?
[40:37.53]Is he right there?
[40:38.75]Is that him?
[40:40.34]What is that?
[40:46.68]I'm afraid to do anything right now.
[40:57.40]Oh, there's gold.
[41:00.04]Normally it shows bosses on the map, but he's not.
[41:08.41]What if we just take all the way over here?
[41:13.65]I don't see him.
[41:14.13]Alright, can I go back and open the chest that I was going to open at this guy's house?
[41:20.84]It's already open.
[41:21.68]There's nothing in it.
[41:24.62]So yeah, go ahead.
[41:26.74]Do your stupid thing.
[41:29.14]Does he leave when there's a party going on?
[41:32.76]No.
[41:33.30]Maybe he doesn't want to... There's no party going on!
[41:35.93]Okay, he's like, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[41:39.59]He hates me!
[41:42.37]Uh, don't die, don't die.
[41:43.55]Give me like two seconds.
[41:44.79]I'm trying!
[41:51.06]It's gonna be close!
[41:52.92]Ooh, it's gonna be close!
[41:54.40]He's dead.
[41:56.01]Okay.
[41:57.97]What'd you get?
[42:00.39]Uh, I got... Broken Star Trail healing potion.
[42:06.61]And... Broken Star Trail.
[42:10.97]It's a weapon.
[42:14.16]Uh, snake banner.
[42:17.16]Vanquisher medal?
[42:20.26]It's nothing.
[42:23.72]It's broken.
[42:25.02]So that means it's bad.
[42:27.76]It's terrible stats.
[42:30.32]Let me see.
[42:33.69]Where are you?
[42:36.71]Here.
[42:40.89]What the?
[42:41.65]What was that?
[42:42.03]I don't know.
[42:44.29]What is going on?
[42:45.21]Oh.
[42:48.93]I want to see.
[42:49.47]I want to see.
[42:50.98]Uh, he has a draw.
[42:51.52]What else did he drop?
[42:52.26]Something else, too.
[42:56.56]Where is it?
[42:57.08]Oh.
[43:00.43]Oh, dude, Graviton Surge.
[43:02.95]Hold on, quick sword.
[43:04.39]Sword.
[43:04.85]Yeah, there we go.
[43:05.49]Okay.
[43:05.63]Okay.
[43:08.17]Well, that was intense.
[43:10.27]Dude, there's a guy that resets the stats on an item.
[43:13.31]I don't know if we ever got him.
[43:15.55]That was fun.
[43:16.91]Because apparently we don't have enough houses.
[43:19.83]Can I, um, my hand's up in the back.
[43:22.23]I'm, like, raising my hand up.
[43:23.99]Yeah.
[43:24.35]Okay, thank you.
[43:25.77]Can we get more health so we don't have to, like, be nerfed the whole time we play the game?
[43:31.72]Um, I would like that, yeah.
[43:39.44]Who the fuck is this guy?
[43:40.73]We just have to go explore to find the health, right?
[43:45.02]Yeah, random parts under the ground.
[43:46.75]Random parts under the ground.
[43:47.61]You got it.
[43:47.95]I'm going.
[43:49.85]If you take our giant tunnel, go down and then go to the right.
[43:52.75]Because I don't think you're supposed to go to the right very much.
[43:54.96]What?
[43:55.28]Oh my god!
[43:57.50]I thought I had an extra, like... I was going to jump.
[43:59.90]I was going to do the double jump.
[44:00.96]But, like, his platform was here.
[44:02.60]I didn't know...
[44:10.17]I was gonna just wait till, you know... Yo, jump!
[44:12.46]Before you hit the ground.
[44:13.16]I didn't know I... Your platform just killed me.
[44:17.88]Oh, good joke.
[44:19.16]It wasn't a joke.
[44:20.66]In fact, destroy the fucking evidence.
[44:25.50]Oh, uh... Good joke.
[44:29.02]Okay, let me... I gotta store some shit before we do anything.
[44:35.88]Oh, the... Calvin's respawning health.
[44:38.90]Nice.
[44:40.87]Alright, let me deposit this stuff.
[44:45.43]Okay.
[44:46.51]Okay.
[44:47.09]Now what do I want with me?
[44:50.61]Oh, definitely like 7,000 torches.
[44:53.98]Hey, where the fuck did the guy go?
[44:57.04]Did he leave?
[44:57.94]Is that enough?
[45:05.56]Did they get invaded yet?
[45:07.62]Spoilers.
[45:07.98]I don't want to see spoilers.
[45:12.06]That can't even happen.
[45:13.76]We're in normal mode.
[45:17.38]Can't even happen.
[45:18.00]We're in normal mode.
[45:19.12]Wait like eight more hours of us playing together.
[45:22.72]That's actually our first Blood Moon.
[45:24.12]What do you mean?
[45:24.96]What are you talking about?
[45:26.56]What?
[45:29.32]What does a Blood Moon do?
[45:30.12]What's that mean?
[45:30.93]Uh, it means they're gonna start attacking.
[45:37.21]Did I just say we haven't been invaded yet and then... Did I do that?
[45:42.26]Well, no, being invaded is like Dark Souls.
[45:44.59]Oh.
[45:45.61]That's where like 16 players show up in your game and gank you.
[45:48.85]Is that really what happens?
[45:50.60]No.
[45:52.92]There's an alien invasion.
[45:54.44]I assume is what they meant.
[46:00.85]Okay, so do we just have to defend the house?
[46:03.61]Yeah, if you want to.
[46:05.99]They drop a special item, blood droplets, and we need a few of them because we've never had a blood moon before, as far as I remember.
[46:12.04]They're getting fucking melted, so... Honestly, if you just stay in the house, they all come to the door, and your summons stay outside, and they'll probably kill everything.
[46:27.37]Oh, cool.
[46:32.07]The door, ah, the door.
[46:38.11]They are coming.
[46:42.11]Alright, I got left side, you get right side.
[46:49.08]God, this makes me feel like a necromancer.
[46:50.58]Thought that was you.
[46:56.63]Wow.
[46:59.47]Who's the guy with the glasses?
[47:01.07]so yeah like yeah we still don't have the freaking the guy that reads like we are missing so many npcs I do not want to build houses for another hour that's the last thing like we should go to hell and just make a whole bunch of rooms for all these idiots we're gonna put these people in hell it sounds kind of mean now we're going collection
[47:31.05]Alright, Blood Orb.
[47:34.23]I'm gonna go up.
[47:35.19]The Dreaded Patchwork.
[47:38.63]What's Patchwork?
[47:40.54]There's a mini-boss on my side.
[47:42.08]Nope.
[47:43.94]Honestly, the Blood Moon, this should have happened to us, like... Years ago.
[47:50.87]So this is all kind of irrelevant.
[47:53.68]Sorry, I've been really bad at muting my sneezes, but I figured, let me be honest with you, if I muted my stream and sneezed, it would still show up on your stream.
[48:01.54]So if I mute, I would have like, I would have fucking like exited Windows.
[48:05.32]You need an actual... You know?
[48:10.70]Come on, be a professional.
[48:14.54]I would have just panicked and pressed a bunch of buttons and probably like restarted my computer accidentally.
[48:21.71]Anything would be better than listening to your bodily fluids, like, eject from your face.
[48:27.86]Um, it's cleaning.
[48:28.62]It's disgusting.
[48:30.58]You disgust me.
[48:36.64]Okay, yeah, what was I doing?
[48:40.52]Tell me how you really feel.
[48:42.62]No.
[48:42.86]Alright, so we're gonna go down in this, the hole underneath the house, eventually?
[48:47.87]Or the one, like, to the right, all the way to the right?
[48:51.07]Oh, shit.
[48:51.73]We need a minotaur skull.
[48:54.73]This would be good for you.
[48:55.85]Uh, how come you're letting stuff in here?
[49:00.06]Uh, I don't know.
[49:00.96]I don't know, dude.
[49:03.20]Did you even, like, clean this up for you?
[49:07.58]What?
[49:07.92]You're letting shit in.
[49:10.50]Why do you have the door open?
[49:14.83]You're supposed to be the Terraria master.
[49:17.15]What?
[49:17.59]Oh, because these guys are chumps.
[49:22.42]How long does a blood moon last?
[49:24.48]All night.
[49:25.40]All night.
[49:25.64]You're not staying here all night.
[49:28.78]Alright.
[49:31.04]I'm getting lots of money and stuff.
[49:33.31]I need to find the goblin guy.
[49:35.33]I need to make rooms.
[49:36.53]Jeremy, here, here, here, here.
[49:37.53]What's gonna happen?
[49:38.99]What?
[49:40.91]Oh, I need to save minotaur skulls.
[49:42.91]Fuck yeah!
[49:43.65]Fuck yeah!
[49:45.29]Hold on.
[49:49.96]Okay.
[49:52.16]Everyone, get hype!
[49:56.80]Can I see some Jerma hypes in the chat?
[50:01.68]Don't do that.
[50:02.20]I don't want to see it.
[50:03.56]Wait, is this... Wait, what?
[50:08.13]I just picked up so many... There's so much shit out here.
[50:10.31]What?
[50:10.41]I don't know what this stuff even is.
[50:11.71]I'm just a vacuum cleaner.
[50:15.03]Severed hand?
[50:15.85]Blood orb?
[50:16.27]Alright.
[50:16.47]Duh.
[50:19.54]Okay, try this item.
[50:22.18]You know that Undertale game?
[50:25.28]It looks like every character in that game.
[50:27.61]Undertale.
[50:28.17]I just dropped down here.
[50:29.27]Have you ever played Undertale?
[50:31.21]No.
[50:31.67]Unpleasant Strange Skull.
[50:33.42]It deals summon damage, but it looks like an actual spell.
[50:38.47]Um, you meant to say, that's, that's, that's just... No, no, no, you're talking about one character in Undertale that everybody says, uh, Sans.
[50:44.57]Right, okay, that's fine.
[50:45.79]Like, the only character.
[50:47.82]No, no, it's like... Yeah, have you ever even played that game?
[50:52.30]Did you leave this door open?
[50:54.10]I did.
[50:54.42]Alright, what the fuck does this do?
[50:59.10]45 plus 1 summon damage.
[51:02.06]Summons a ghastly skull to shoot laser beams, which cause damage over time.
[51:07.32]So, it...
[51:10.68]Yeah, I don't know really what that means.
[51:15.32]Once this is, uh... You're having a bad time.
[51:25.32]Till death.
[51:27.94]What?
[51:28.14]I just got an achievement?
[51:29.80]What is till death?
[51:31.14]Dude, I don't... I don't know.
[51:33.61]Ronnie would like to watch your broadcast.
[51:35.87]A request from Steam.
[51:45.19]Is that even?
[51:46.26]That profile picture can't actually be you, Ronnie.
[51:50.42]I want to watch you play on Steam, please.
[51:53.30]That's funny.
[51:53.98]Oh my god, you're so needy.
[51:58.67]I want a higher quality version.
[52:01.17]I forgive you, that's a very good joke.
[52:04.71]It's probably because I talked shit about the cables and then ignored chat and you probably said something.
[52:11.19]We had to, like, wallow in pity.
[52:13.26]Okay, um, I feel like we've been collecting so many things.
[52:16.00]Yeah, no, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[52:17.52]Go underground and just look for the hearts.
[52:20.25]But let me deposit shit.
[52:22.29]Also, it might be worth it to use a spelunker potion, because you can see the hearts through walls.
[52:29.55]Like, everything lights up.
[52:31.50]Yeah, so if you get... Don't use, like, one potion on this.
[52:34.98]Do not use more than one potion or I'm going to fucking scream.
[52:37.50]Don't use more than one spelunker potion.
[52:40.92]Spelunker.
[52:42.98]You ever play Spelunky?
[52:43.84]You know Spelunky 2 is coming out?
[52:44.94]I have played Spelunky, and I was like, yeah, this is fun, but I didn't really do much in it.
[52:49.07]Alright, what do I do?
[52:49.83]Spelunk?
[52:51.07]I can't say the half of that word.
[52:55.41]Just one, you said.
[52:57.65]Yeah.
[52:58.19]It lasts for five minutes.
[53:00.38]Use it when you go underground.
[53:01.80]How do I take just one thing out of the deposit box?
[53:06.36]I don't know.
[53:07.78]Oh, I got one.
[53:08.28]Okay.
[53:09.67]right use just use it when we go underground and then look for hearts yeah just run around you'll like zoom out all the way too I'm not doing don't be a boomer put your glasses on no I'm not going to do that zoom out and then you'll be able to see the heart I can't do that and you can collect them really quickly use the skull
[53:40.53]What the hell?
[53:43.71]Is that better than this?
[53:46.45]Better than what?
[53:51.69]I think it might be.
[53:52.95]Better than what I was using before for, like, my main.
[53:56.86]I base what I like on sounds, though.
[53:59.94]And I'm not sure if... I don't like that sound.
[54:01.88]Oh, you don't like the sound.
[54:04.48]Alright, so you said go down underneath our base and just start looking for hearts.
[54:08.34]Yeah.
[54:09.44]I'm going for it.
[54:15.72]I apologize, but you do not like the sound, though.
[54:23.20]Okay.
[54:24.36]How far zoomed he is is unreal.
[54:29.45]Jarvan, you better zoom out.
[54:32.05]What?
[54:32.51]I can't... I can't see!
[54:39.65]I'm not doing it.
[54:43.70]If you waste the Spelunker potion, I'm gonna be mad.
[54:47.19]Like, if you end the Spelunker potion and you're like, okay, I got one heart.
[54:54.13]I'm at 139%.
[54:54.69]Remember that.
[54:59.96]Oh, gross.
[55:00.74]I hate it.
[55:01.52]Alright, I'm taking the Spelunker potion now.
[55:05.51]Aren't you the same person who is, like, one of the only people that agrees with me that Path of Exile, like, makes you vomit because of how close you are to the screen?
[55:15.65]Yes.
[55:16.67]But that's different.
[55:17.41]That's top-down.
[55:18.13]How is that different?
[55:18.67]Top-down view.
[55:19.09]And it's 3D.
[55:26.59]Alright, will the hearts just be hearts or is it like in a box or something?
[55:30.39]The big red heart crystals.
[55:34.03]There is also life quartz which will be like blocks that have hearts in them.
[55:44.06]Okay, this is cool though.
[55:46.84]We can do this.
[55:47.56]Five minutes of this?
[55:48.50]That's not that much.
[55:49.22]We can just tell a funny story.
[55:54.71]What?
[55:56.55]Ah, dude, I want to hit you.
[55:58.99]Get out of here.
[55:59.59]Alright, I need to... Hold on a second.
[56:07.66]I want to see you bleed.
[56:11.38]Why don't you just do the Batman thing?
[56:13.90]I have one question.
[56:15.06]Do you bleed?
[56:19.42]Batman the B.M.? ?

[56:58.18]Like, who even figured that out?
[57:07.04]Ooh, we got cool stuff over here.
[57:11.66]Okay, so it's a chest.
[57:13.60]I don't see any heart, though.
[57:17.74]What is this thing?
[57:21.73]Looks like a person's house.
[57:23.96]Okay, Arcane Band.
[57:27.96]Bomb, shuriken, swiftness potion, recall potion, and some torches.
[57:34.84]Alright, very cool, very cool.

[58:04.26]Is that really loud?
[58:05.00]Did I peak the mic on that?
[58:07.74]Oh, if you want to hear a mic being peaked, I got it.
[58:09.70]Don't fucking do it.
[58:10.68]Like, everybody hates that.
[58:11.68]Nobody likes that.
[58:12.35]Okay.
[58:19.33]Alright, I got it.
[58:22.61]Life crystal!
[58:23.33]So I just take it, right?
[58:25.42]Yeah.
[58:26.52]And it's a 20 HP?
[58:28.88]Yep.
[58:31.69]Cool.
[58:33.49]Now this is the part of the game that I was talking about.
[58:34.89]This is the part of the game that I wanted to see.
[58:36.13]You're like about spawning bosses and going and picking up meteors.
[58:41.34]I wanted to go look at stuff.
[58:42.32]You're doing it.
[58:43.28]Dude, the problem is that I've had to hold your hand at every step.
[58:47.16]If the part of the game you want to see is exploring, then fucking go do it.
[58:51.52]Every time I go do it, you go, oh, I need a demon, demon, uh, titan ore.
[58:56.62]Hold on.
[58:59.54]I have been very respectful of you.
[59:02.62]I have been patient.
[59:03.58]I haven't, not at all.
[59:05.42]Everyone was like, man, stars are really, like, fucking trying to rush him.
[59:09.28]I don't like it.
[59:12.70]And I kept muting last stream going, like, I know, what the fuck, I don't know what to do.
[59:16.16]Like, what the fuck?
[59:21.70]No.
[59:23.12]That's not how that happened.
[59:28.44]What do we got in here?
[59:33.44]Have you found one?
[59:35.71]I'm not looking.
[59:36.29]Wait, you're the one with the potion.
[59:41.67]We don't both have the potion.
[59:44.07]Why didn't you take one and do this?
[59:45.17]There's nothing in this chest.
[59:47.13]How the fuck is that possible?
[59:50.25]So are we splitting these?
[59:53.02]Or is it like five escape routes?
[59:54.00]I have max.
[59:55.22]Just keep using them.
[60:04.76]Where is this guy?
[60:05.34]180.
[60:08.90]Alright.
[60:10.00]You have max health right now?
[60:12.14]Yeah, I might have spunky potion right now.
[60:18.77]Can you deliver one?
[60:21.38]Can I- can I uber eats a Spelunky potion?
[60:23.66]I don't even need it.
[60:30.49]I'll find one.
[60:42.84]Okay.
[60:44.36]Not bad.
[60:44.80]Come on.
[60:46.98]What is that?
[60:49.38]What is this thing?
[60:52.86]What was that?
[60:56.18]Was that a dragon?
[60:56.86]Hey, I just killed a dragon down here.
[61:01.53]He dropped a starfish.
[61:07.71]Good job.
[61:12.29]Good job, buddy.
[61:21.45]Ooh, what's this?
[61:23.51]Chest.
[61:25.29]How come I can only have... Did something happen here?
[61:28.71]Why can I only have two of these?
[61:30.55]It was three before.
[61:32.99]Am I missing something here?
[61:42.41]Does it say they count as two on the staff?
[61:46.03]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[61:48.52]Because your bewitching table probably just wore off.
[61:55.58]Ooh, cool.
[61:57.36]Recall potion.
[61:58.28]I got some recall potions, though, we can share.
[62:01.10]You don't share them.
[62:02.40]You have the mirror.
[62:05.10]Oh, I thought that... No, those are not wormhole.
[62:07.81]Uh, alright.
[62:08.29]Sword items.
[62:08.81]Okay.
[62:11.13]Wait.
[62:12.17]What the fuck?
[62:16.57]I'll figure this out later.
[62:22.53]Okay, that's better.
[62:28.68]I don't really like this thing.
[62:29.88]It might be good for bosses, but it takes, like, kind of too long and it can't shoot through walls.
[62:33.34]Alright, hold on.
[62:40.38]I'm getting to, like, water here.
[62:43.68]Water.
[62:44.34]I'm kind of concerned about this.
[62:48.11]What is that?
[62:48.59]What's a giant clam?
[62:52.53]Giant clam down here.
[62:53.59]I found the giant clam star.
[62:59.11]Come to me!
[63:02.88]Where is he?
[63:07.92]What do you want?
[63:08.72]I'm- I'm- I was busy, uh, bulletin-ling my chat.
[63:10.88]I got a giant clam!
[63:12.47]Here.
[63:12.65]There's a giant clam boss.
[63:15.65]Oh, oh, oh!
[63:16.83]Okay, I'm coming.
[63:20.87]I don't know where it is.
[63:21.59]It's here somewhere.
[63:25.36]um we're gonna have to go underwater and we like can't breathe underwater it's a shitty ball like easy to kill for us yeah but still we can't breathe underwater and now I'm wasting my oh it's right here yeah what are you talking about oh he is right here dead okay yeah it's like one of the first bosses you're supposed to kill but he makes an npc summon oh
[63:58.66]Well, that thing was really stupid.
[64:00.72]Alright, let me see if I can find another heart.
[64:05.55]Amidius?
[64:06.43]Amidius the Sea King.
[64:07.57]What does that guy do?
[64:08.37]Anything cool?
[64:12.51]The NPC?
[64:14.05]Yeah, there's a guy down there now.
[64:15.69]Yeah, he sells weapons.
[64:18.00]Are they good?
[64:22.68]They're okay.
[64:24.94]I think we're a little bit past them now.
[64:33.95]How many do you need?
[64:35.51]What's the max health?
[64:38.44]The max is 300.
[64:39.20]I need, like, five of them, then.
[64:42.38]Have you just been taking them?
[64:43.22]Okay, I have two.
[64:44.00]Alright, that should be fine.
[64:47.67]No, we have to get you to 300, because then there's, like, a... Just, we're getting you to 300.
[64:52.39]Don't... Don't give up.
[64:56.79]Okay.
[64:58.68]I'm gonna run out of, like, inventory space.
[65:03.57]How many do you need?
[65:06.27]What are you at?
[65:07.13]I'm at 180.
[65:07.47]Yeah, I'm telling you.
[65:11.41]You've been eating these.
[65:12.19]You've just been eating all the lunch.
[65:15.60]You're also not very good at finding them.
[65:17.64]I've got three already.
[65:20.18]I had the Spelunky potion and there was only one over here.
[65:23.36]Well, you gotta go quickly through the ground.
[65:25.40]Cover the most ground.
[65:26.40]Zoom out.
[65:27.42]I'm zoomed out.
[65:30.77]About 400 is max, by the way.
[65:35.42]I was going to preemptively warn you to not listen to your chat on this shit, Jerma.
[65:39.24]But you're falling for it.
[65:40.26]They think they're smart.
[65:41.64]They think they know what they're talking about.
[65:42.96]And they're going to backseat you and say, actually, it's a 400.
[65:46.72]But you need to just like fucking smack them and keep them in line.
[65:50.77]Tell them you're the streamer and to trust you.
[65:55.73]Can you do that?
[65:57.47]Why would I ever strike somebody in my chair?
[66:00.28]That's fucking uncalled for.
[66:03.84]It's the only way some people learn.
[66:09.97]What the fuck is a rude elemental?
[66:14.13]It's really mean.
[66:15.77]It's kind of like what I'm doing right now.
[66:19.58]Is there one above me?
[66:20.20]Hold on.
[66:26.16]These guys are really distracting.
[66:30.35]They're like just screaming in my ear, it seems.
[66:32.97]Hold on.
[66:43.93]Just despawn them?
[66:44.71]Yeah, but what if I get attacked?
[66:45.63]I mean, I need them.
[66:49.13]Remember, you don't need anybody.
[66:50.83]Is there nothing up here?
[66:52.73]There's nothing up here.
[66:53.61]You're a star all on your own.
[66:55.85]You don't need these people.
[66:56.77]There's another giant clam.
[67:00.61]Ignore him.
[67:05.76]There's a chest here.
[67:06.58]There's a worm in here too, apparently.
[67:12.36]What is this?
[67:15.73]Cloud in the bottle.
[67:17.05]Stop!
[67:17.51]What the fuck?
[67:20.51]Wait, what?
[67:23.91]You motherfucker, really?
[67:25.29]What are you doing here?
[67:27.94]Get away from me!
[67:29.46]Okay, I've got four hearts for you.
[67:31.16]Dude!
[67:44.53]Okay, this is what we call unfair.
[67:46.29]He's dead, but I don't want to... That's bullshit.
[67:54.25]I'm eating this fucking hamburger.
[67:58.37]What the fuck else is even else in here?
[68:01.49]Giant pearl.
[68:02.23]I don't have enough inventory space.
[68:05.97]Where are my summons?
[68:06.95]I don't want them.
[68:10.81]It doesn't want to give them to me anymore?
[68:14.62]They might be stuck somewhere else so you can unsummon them by the stat.
[68:19.51]Give her the trash.
[68:20.33]Underneath your bar.
[68:21.83]Door.
[68:25.99]Mud blocks.
[68:27.39]I have, like, mud.
[68:31.27]That's funny to you?
[68:33.51]It's kind of funny because, like, I don't want this stuff.
[68:37.48]Have you been auto-trashing things?
[68:39.30]No.
[68:42.66]Get on it.
[68:47.72]Rope.
[68:48.12]I don't have any rope.
[68:49.66]Dangerous potion?
[68:53.60]I swear I had a... Hold on.
[68:58.08]I swear I had a shadow key.
[68:59.62]Oh my god, how do I just delete an item?
[69:05.99]How do you just delete an item?
[69:09.57]You drag it to the bottom right of your inventory.
[69:12.75]What the fuck?!
[69:13.73]Oh my god!
[69:19.69]There was a door in there!
[69:26.79]Okay, Jerma, uh... I don't know what you're on about, but here you can have... Okay, the trash in the lower right, you said.
[69:32.53]I'm putting it in and it just, like, takes up a space.
[69:36.57]What?
[69:40.07]Why... Oh my god, no, it doesn't.
[69:43.20]Why does it just not just disappear?
[69:46.78]It's the last thing you delete it in case you want to take it out.
[69:49.73]Oh, God damn it.
[69:50.76]I was like, what?
[69:51.76]The one for the left of that is auto delete.
[69:54.90]And everything you put on that list, the moment you pick it up, it auto trash.
[69:59.20]Because I'm sitting there going like, why is this like taking up an inventory space now?
[70:06.23]Hello.
[70:06.61]Here's four life crystals.
[70:07.85]Don't delete them.
[70:09.53]Also, here's an item that you will enjoy.
[70:11.75]You know, try that hasty necromancer's heart out a little bit.
[70:20.24]Just laughing.
[70:21.02]Just laughing.
[70:22.50]Just laugh it up.
[70:24.11]Don't drown in your bath tonight.
[70:26.35]Get some water wings.
[70:27.85]It was like two feet of water.
[70:29.25]I know.
[70:29.59]That's why I thought I was safe.
[70:33.29]Look, there's a lot going on there, okay?
[70:38.40]I have a full inventory.
[70:42.40]Get rid of this.
[70:43.96]Everybody, we're real worried about you.
[70:48.20]I'm fine.
[70:49.26]Relax.
[70:50.12]You didn't tell me that I had to do that.
[70:52.80]I did.
[70:53.26]It was one of the very first things I explained to you.
[70:55.26]And that was also a week and a half ago.
[70:59.00]I thought that you would have a memory of a week.
[71:04.11]Oh, yeah?
[71:04.47]Well, how come you didn't know how to turn the server on correctly this week?
[71:08.47]I distinctly remember you saying, I forgot how we did this last week.
[71:12.61]That's a distinct thing that I heard last week.
[71:14.27]Is that not true?
[71:15.07]I don't think that happened.
[71:18.50]Hey, is the server working?
[71:21.70]That's a... You ain't gonna fucking fool me.
[71:24.40]Alright, slowly limit 20 mana.
[71:25.48]That's way better than this.
[71:28.77]Alright, so, the cloud and a bottle?
[71:36.15]Yeah.
[71:39.17]So there's, like, different versions of that cloud.
[71:41.10]Fleeting cloud.
[71:41.98]Intrepid cloud.
[71:44.91]When it says that, that's the stat associated with it.
[71:47.45]Or it'll be like plus three move speed or something random on it.
[71:50.72]And you can re-roll that stat.
[71:52.90]Do you want this one that has melee speed?
[71:56.12]No.
[71:57.48]So should I just dump it somewhere?
[71:59.30]You can probably just sell it.
[72:03.77]Alright, well what is this?
[72:05.91]What am I doing?
[72:06.61]Release bees, win damage, that's good.
[72:09.83]After taking damage from enemy, deal damage to all nearby enemies, that's alright.
[72:12.59]This one's not that great though.
[72:16.39]I mean, you take a lot of damage.
[72:21.34]Can you go over max mana?
[72:25.76]Yes.
[72:26.68]Items will go over max mana.
[72:28.10]Okay, yeah, just making sure.
[72:29.40]So max mana is just how many stars you can use, and then there's some items later on that'll give you like 100 plus max mana.
[72:35.61]Right.
[72:36.37]Okay, that's cool.
[72:41.89]Did I pick up anything else?
[72:45.34]Let me see this.
[72:47.72]Bastion's mana-powered armor.
[72:49.22]Since I'm assuming this, I can take hits with my mana bar instead of my health bar, I'm assuming.
[72:55.70]Yeah.
[72:56.77]Dwayne's effect.
[72:58.37]That's actually really good.
[72:59.95]Sometimes I don't know if you're asking me a question, your chat a question, or yourself.
[73:04.25]All at the same time.
[73:06.19]Because I feel like I'm falling for a trap if I answer you.
[73:11.03]No.
[73:12.33]Like, he's gonna figure this out himself in, like, two seconds, right?
[73:15.19]Let's see.
[73:18.45]But it's rude to ignore you.
[73:20.88]No, I'm just talking.
[73:21.68]I just... What, you don't, like, talk out loud?
[73:32.18]Only works if you have no armor or vanity armor equipped.
[73:34.62]Well, that's kind of... Oh, that item's not good.
[73:37.55]Yeah, I was gonna say, that doesn't make any sense.
[73:41.07]Necromancer's Heart.
[73:45.69]max number of centuries by one decreases your life regen oh it's worth it oh but okay what is this a helmet it's an accessory oh okay it's a necromancer's heart do I put this on my head stick it on
[74:13.45]I don't know if it was like a chest piece.
[74:14.85]You know how games are.
[74:15.85]Yeah.
[74:17.71]That rune of bleeding is... I know how games are.
[74:19.39]I'm gonna switch out the rune of bleeding for this.
[74:26.07]Because I like this one.
[74:26.95]I like the double jump.
[74:29.62]Okay.
[74:33.80]What is making that loud-ass noise over here?
[74:35.44]Oh, that's a little rumor.
[74:39.18]Alright, so, um, what do you want to do now?
[74:42.19]That we have, like, some health?
[74:44.05]Uh, you, you need to get to 300 health.
[74:46.25]I need to have 300, okay.
[74:48.31]You are not allowed to do anything else until you, you get there.
[74:51.87]Okay, I'm not, I'm not allowed to do anything else.
[74:54.79]Okay, I'm running an associated errand.
[74:58.17]Okay.
[75:02.31]I'm gonna go, uh, do you care if I take another Spelunky potion?
[75:07.51]Or will you be mad at me for that?
[75:09.84]You know, I'll accept it.
[75:11.00]I accept that this is the way things are just going to have to be.
[75:14.66]And then when we kill Plantera and we don't have any freaking Spelunky potions, I'll just know who to blame.
[75:24.53]Okay, so don't take one, is what you're saying?
[75:27.61]No, go ahead.
[75:30.43]Just do whatever you want.
[75:31.75]It's what you normally do anyway.
[75:33.97]There's none even in here.
[75:36.11]Oh, yeah, I took them.
[75:36.95]Oh.
[75:37.53]Was that your, like, insurance policy to make sure I couldn't take them?
[75:40.75]Oh, no, because I used one to help you find some.
[75:42.97]And I got you four.
[75:43.67]Okay.
[75:46.42]And you got one.
[75:47.84]I was just, you know, just trying to help.
[75:54.82]I'm going to bring the bombs down with me.
[76:01.60]I'm going to start blowing stuff up down there.
[76:11.32]No, I don't.
[76:18.91]Alright.
[76:19.93]It's time to go on an explosion spree.
[76:25.15]Three, four.
[76:26.87]Alright, and I can have one, two.
[76:28.78]That's insane.
[76:29.62]That's awesome.
[76:31.56]Cool.
[76:34.70]Alright, I'm gonna go down.
[76:36.94]Just pick a spot and just go down.
[76:42.83]I might even pass you.
[76:43.73]I would say hello on the way down.
[76:47.86]No.
[76:50.10]No, kid.
[76:53.30]You're eons behind me.
[77:01.49]You're like a roach to me.
[77:02.85]Alright.
[77:09.85]I don't think I'm gonna go down this far.
[77:12.99]I'm gonna go over here I mean as long as there's an easy path to just run along quickly that's all you all you need I guess I'm just gonna go also if you went to the jungle there is usually a lot in the jungle and the jungle is pretty open the jungle probably already used the potion so it's I did not use any potion I don't have any potions you took them all uh so you wait don't go that don't go as far down as like the water here here here do this do this
[77:43.33]Go back up to the surface, and then keep walking left until you get to the jungle.
[77:47.65]It'll be the area that's jungly and green and muddy.
[77:53.81]And you should pretty easily be able to find some in there, if not some chests and other stuff, because we haven't been in the dungeon at all, or in the jungle at all.
[78:03.28]On my way.
[78:17.09]Who's this guy?
[78:20.50]I'm going to get a lot of use out of that.
[78:21.72]Alright, there's a way we can... This looks kind of jungly, doesn't it?
[78:24.62]This is not the jungle?
[78:35.04]I guess not.
[78:45.15]Jerm's gonna hate the jungle, I feel.
[78:46.79]Why do you feel that?
[79:02.61]This is desert.
[79:13.35]Okay.
[79:15.09]Uh, I think I'm getting close.
[79:20.41]Did you open this chest already?
[79:21.21]I mean, I'm at the meteor.
[79:24.57]There's nothing even down over here.
[79:40.36]Meteor head?
[79:43.55]keep going left past the meteor past the meteor okay ouch nope I was prepared for that jump ouch I see what you're doing alright then up this hill there's the giant hole and just keep going down the giant hole
[80:12.98]This does look like a jungle.
[80:18.63]Alright.
[80:22.17]I am at a hole that's in the ground.
[80:24.51]Is that the one you're talking about?
[80:25.71]This big one that's down here?
[80:27.07]Alright.
[80:28.73]Let's go get some hearts.
[80:30.90]Stand back.
[80:31.54]I'm gonna throw bombs everywhere.
[80:55.46]These are not as strong as I thought they were going to be.
[80:58.07]They're actually very weak.
[80:59.91]But it's okay.
[81:00.60]I have a lot of them.
[81:25.33]Is that going to hit me?
[81:27.19]No.
[81:27.71]Yes.
[81:29.28]Yes.
[81:29.78]Watch out.
[81:30.66]It's not going to hit me.
[81:32.32]Alright.
[81:32.96]Spot.
[81:33.28]Let's take a look.
[81:44.46]Never mind.
[81:46.42]Never mind.
[81:50.01]Oops.
[81:50.37]Oops.
[81:52.47]Oopsies.
[81:53.67]No.
[81:54.03]Even better.
[81:57.38]Alright, I think there's something right here.
[82:02.68]Pretty cool.
[82:07.30]Found a little cave system.
[82:13.69]Hmm.
[82:24.90]Hmm.
[82:32.77]Alright, keeps going down.
[82:37.31]There's no internet in the jungle.
[82:38.65]Alright, hold on a minute here.
[82:44.98]I ain't gonna fucking screw around.
[82:46.32]Alright, it's safe.
[82:53.38]Uh, Moonglow.
[82:54.42]Just bomb it.
[83:12.62]Did you say you were gonna teleport to me?
[83:15.54]Uh, soon.
[83:17.54]I'm trying to get you the thing that you need to have after you finish getting life crystals.
[83:21.88]Ooh.
[83:23.04]Yellow slug, I guess there's something down here.
[83:27.70]I got one.
[83:27.96]I'm planning for your future.
[83:29.02]I, uh, I found one.
[83:35.35]Life crystal.
[83:39.29]And... Spiked anklet of the wind!
[83:44.96]10% increased movement speed and plus 2% damage.
[83:50.05]That seems pretty great.
[83:51.61]It combines with something else, I think, to make, like, lightning boots or something.
[83:55.19]Damn.
[83:59.33]Archery potion.
[84:00.87]Recall potion.
[84:01.78]I have some of those.
[84:04.44]And a honey dispenser.
[84:07.08]Oh, yeah.
[84:13.63]Okay.
[84:16.26]What about this thing?
[84:17.22]Green torch.
[84:18.74]I want that.
[84:21.04]Alright, I need... I need one more heart.
[84:26.01]So, don't even use the potion.
[84:27.89]There's no reason to do that.
[84:30.31]Okay.
[84:30.57]I mean, I'm gonna... I just need one more.
[84:47.40]No, I'm not gonna drown in here.
[84:48.60]I'm gonna make sure of that.
[84:52.11]What?
[84:52.95]What's wrong?
[84:56.01]What?
[84:56.99]Nothing.
[84:57.63]It's fine.
[84:58.57]Everything's fine.
[84:59.51]This is almost bad, but it's fine.
[85:01.21]I wanna get in there.
[85:10.68]I feel like I'll drown in there.
[85:12.20]I think I really might.
[85:13.02]What, club tornado?
[85:13.68]Club tornado.
[85:16.81]Alright.
[85:17.27]No, I'm going to go this way.
[85:19.07]That's underwater.
[85:19.97]I don't like that.
[85:20.47]Dude, just bomb everything.
[85:27.05]That's what I'm doing.
[85:28.90]Nice.
[85:35.28]Didn't I have more bombs than that?
[85:41.44]I thought I had more bombs than that.
[85:44.38]I guess I used them all.
[85:47.38]Time to dig!
[85:47.80]You did use a bit.
[85:57.53]Get the fish, fish, fish!
[85:58.93]Do I?
[86:01.41]No I don't.
[86:01.95]I don't have to get the fish.
[86:10.85]Alright, this... hold on a minute here.
[86:16.31]It's safe.
[86:17.59]Ooh, I can go that way.
[86:22.37]What's this way?
[86:25.37]So much to learn!
[86:31.08]Hmm.
[86:33.46]You killed a Hellbat.
[86:34.68]Good for you!
[86:44.07]I don't think there's anything up there.
[86:57.09]I'll go down here.
[87:00.32]Mud block, right?
[87:01.60]The mud block is going to be auto-deleted when it's in that right slot, right?
[87:05.32]Yeah.
[87:06.56]Left slot.
[87:07.54]The left slot?
[87:09.78]The left slot is your list of...
[87:13.45]Enable auto trash.
[87:14.13]I mean, it's on the right, but the left one on the right.
[87:20.69]How do I put something in there?
[87:21.85]Enable auto trash to automatically trash items.
[87:23.85]Is it not enabled?
[87:24.73]How do I enable it?
[87:26.66]The top button, I think, enables it.
[87:29.42]One of them does.
[87:29.96]There's like side buttons on it.
[87:33.96]Oh, okay.
[87:34.28]There we go.
[87:38.80]It's kind of blending in.
[87:49.07]Mmm, what's down here?
[87:52.55]Pee-pee-poo-poo is down there.
[87:55.39]Nice.
[87:56.79]Nice, dude.
[87:57.35]Nice.
[87:58.05]Yeah.
[87:58.67]Epic.
[87:59.64]Hello.
[88:00.06]He pulls out a pee-pee-poo-poo.
[88:02.86]I love pee-pee-poo-poo.
[88:04.72]You're really gonna pull out a pee-pee-poo-poo?
[88:09.50]Yeah.
[88:10.36]Unbelievable.
[88:14.87]oh come on where's one how many life quartz as you walk by zero I've been keeping my eyes open you've been you've been getting life quartz when you see it it's the I know what it looks like life what do you mean okay
[88:44.34]Yeah, he has no clue.
[88:48.18]What do you mean life core?
[88:50.89]You don't have to tell me something.
[88:51.95]It's different than the heart.
[88:53.65]It's a block.
[88:54.75]It's heart blocks.
[88:55.87]And when you combine 10, you get a life crystal.
[88:58.19]Oh, okay.
[89:01.20]Cool.
[89:04.11]That's really good to know.
[89:05.59]I'm glad that you told me this.
[89:07.34]I did earlier.
[89:10.52]Hey, it doesn't even matter.
[89:12.16]Stop, stop, stop.
[89:12.92]It doesn't matter.
[89:14.14]I'm done.
[89:16.88]It doesn't matter.
[89:17.42]I'm good.
[89:18.60]Okay.
[89:20.24]Holy fucking god.
[89:21.74]That would have been so embarrassing.
[89:23.22]That would have been an actually horribly embarrassing thing.
[89:28.59]I would have had to delete my Twitch account if I just fell there and died because it was dark.
[89:34.43]Alright, let me just get up there with the rope.
[89:37.44]You're moving a mixer?
[89:38.18]You know, it's a really easy, funny joke to make, you know?
[89:44.06]I mean, you really don't have to be funny on Twitch.
[89:47.04]You just have to stay current with whatever the current thing everyone is saying.
[89:50.16]And then you'll be, like, accepted into the fold.
[89:54.01]I have 300.
[89:55.45]You're trying too hard with your carnivals and your fucking movie nights.
[90:03.66]Just like, come on.
[90:07.02]Cut his mic quick.
[90:12.63]What the fuck?
[90:13.79]Okay.
[90:17.23]I think I just would have died, but I landed on health.
[90:19.97]Yeah, just throw your cat.
[90:21.43]Get your dog in there.
[90:22.27]Get Anno in there and chuck him.
[90:23.43]I would never do that to a fucking dog.
[90:30.29]You are fucked.
[90:34.01]Hey, I got another one.
[90:36.05]Does Otto ever do malicious poops?
[90:38.61]Like, what's with dogs and malicious poops?
[90:42.08]Why are you saying it like that?
[90:43.78]Well, where it's like they poop somewhere they know they're not supposed to because they're trying to get back at you.
[90:51.58]Like, me and Ashley left the house the other day for a while together, and she hates when people leave, like all dogs do.
[90:58.69]But she's like...
[91:00.48]such a baby I come back and there's two poops like hidden in my bathroom behind the toilet malicious poops alright I'm coming back I have 300 health are you ready to move on I got 300 HP I'm ready to move on are you oh yeah I have 300 health are you wasn't that the whole point me to get 300 health
[91:28.52]Alright, this is a really good ring.
[91:30.44]Do you, like, want this?
[91:31.38]I don't even know what the hell it is.
[91:37.42]What ring?
[91:37.92]This anklet, sorry.
[91:39.86]Oh, not for the storage?
[91:44.86]Alright, let me make sure I have everything I want.
[91:49.46]Torch.
[91:49.82]I want that one.
[91:51.92]I'm almost out of apples.
[91:57.67]Severed hand.
[92:00.91]Auto trash.
[92:02.31]Is it just thrown away?
[92:04.03]Auto trash.
[92:05.79]Okay.
[92:05.93]You're going to pick up a lot of them.
[92:08.71]Anyone buy these off you?
[92:12.91]Not worth it.
[92:15.54]I had mud blocks in auto trash.
[92:21.92]Oh, what the hell is going on here?
[92:23.18]I need to zoom in.
[92:25.34]You know you can...
[92:27.17]Auto trash more than one thing.
[92:31.33]Right?
[92:31.49]I think you're getting that, right?
[92:39.62]How do I add another slot?
[92:42.22]Every time you put something in the auto trash slot, it is auto trashed.
[92:47.16]So you'll never pick it up again.
[92:48.50]So even if you stack it on top of it?
[92:52.17]Yeah.
[92:52.59]And then if you... Oh, okay.
[92:55.39]And then if you... How do you do it?
[92:59.13]The middle button.
[92:59.97]If you click the middle button, it shows you everything that's in there.
[93:02.35]And then you can remove things later.
[93:03.65]That's good to know.
[93:04.23]Okay.
[93:07.04]I believe I'm ready to do whatever you want to do now.
[93:14.46]Okay.
[93:15.02]139?
[93:15.10]I know.
[93:15.42]I'm compromising.
[93:17.22]Give me like... Give me like... I'm coming.
[93:19.10]I'm coming.
[93:19.92]I'm coming.
[93:21.52]Okay.
[93:21.80]Come here.
[93:22.06]Come here.
[93:24.75]Take these Blazing Hearts for you.
[93:26.87]Mm-hmm.
[93:27.97]Now, use those.
[93:28.97]Those are the new life crystal.
[93:30.95]You can get up to 400 now.
[93:37.54]I couldn't find many more of them, though.
[93:39.34]That's fine.
[93:41.00]We'll be fine.
[93:42.16]I'm sorry.
[93:44.08]You didn't use your last crystal?
[93:46.12]I couldn't.
[93:46.78]It's stored.
[93:48.47]There's a life crystal that's in there.
[93:50.43]Can you do anything with them after you reach max HP?
[93:54.78]I don't think so.
[93:56.08]There might be some recipes with them, so I'd keep it.
[93:58.94]But I forget.
[93:59.50]It's just in the stash.
[94:01.92]There's a fucking fireplace in here?
[94:03.66]This guy's crazy.
[94:04.94]Okay, there we go.
[94:13.89]Alright.
[94:19.53]Very cool.
[94:20.19]I need some more torches.
[94:21.55]Are we going somewhere dark?
[94:23.99]Um...
[94:26.76]I don't know yet.
[94:28.24]Torches are wood and... What was it?
[94:30.38]Wood and... Gel or something?
[94:32.58]And gel.
[94:35.53]We don't have any wood.
[94:38.11]Gonna have to cut down some trees.
[94:39.69]Do you have any wood?
[94:42.53]Nope.
[94:43.03]Do we have any trees left to cut down?
[94:44.75]Or just buy them?
[94:47.73]Who sells them?
[94:48.89]I mean, yeah, there's trees all over the map.
[94:50.61]Left or right.
[94:51.37]I'm just gonna buy them.
[94:54.19]Who sells them?
[94:56.04]I think I might have damned him.
[94:57.70]Oh, he's here.
[94:59.02]Yeah, this guy.
[95:00.68]The old guy with the beard.
[95:01.56]Oh, okay, yeah.
[95:06.70]I think I might have damned him.
[95:08.95]You may have damned him.
[95:10.23]Yeah, I think he might be gone for all eternity.
[95:13.89]Let's do 100.
[95:16.97]Alright.
[95:18.38]Where to now that we have good HP?
[95:22.31]What's the plan?
[95:24.83]Slime God.
[95:25.99]Slime God.
[95:28.59]Alright, let's go kick his ass.
[95:33.58]And maybe next time that I see you in the game, I can kick your ass.
[95:45.90]uh we need one little ingredient do you guys seriously don't remember that reggie quote I'm glad that one person got that I actually forgot too who's reggie
[96:08.63]It's Nintendo World Championships 2014.
[96:10.71]See, I didn't know that part, but you did, and that's good.
[96:21.57]As somebody myself who's sick of companies and corporations and people selling out, I, for one, love Reggie Fils-Aimé for selling me Nintendo games.
[96:30.03]He made it fun.
[96:32.76]You can't.
[96:33.94]I'm sorry.
[96:34.46]There are some things that you cannot, like, talk shit about Reggie.
[96:38.31]You can't.
[96:39.89]There's some things that I would tolerate.
[96:44.25]He worked his way into my heart through a very calculated marketing plan that he himself didn't even come up.
[96:49.33]I fucking love that guy.
[96:51.14]I mean, I'm just, I'm not, I can't stand for that, like, at all.
[96:55.08]You know what?
[96:56.80]Maybe, like, one guy in either of our chats really thought about it for a second and was like, you know what?
[97:03.34]Ster is a salty ball sack, but he might be right.
[97:11.11]I can't agree with his lifestyle.
[97:13.65]Cut his mic.
[97:14.21]I'm about to.
[97:18.85]He's going to get his mic cut quick.
[97:23.87]Alright.
[97:24.87]I'm ready.
[97:25.33]I got my bacon cheeseburger.
[97:27.31]I'm ready.
[97:28.96]No, just sell this.
[97:30.88]Actually, we still have potion merchants.
[97:34.53]Monty or... Alright, I think that's pretty fucking good, actually.
[97:37.01]I'm gonna eat it.
[97:41.97]Alright, I got... I just clicked the thing, so are we moving?
[97:48.66]Uh, I'm grabbing a thing real quick, and then we're gonna fight the slime god.
[97:51.96]Ooh.
[97:52.06]Ooh.
[98:06.72]Okay, I wonder how many times and I know it's like completely necessary but I wonder how many times has been said during these two sessions of I'm just gonna go grab this thing real quick And he's just gone I would have to give you a whole quest to go on to like distract you and I really just need 25 of a specific block right now Do you want to walk over here with me and get this block with me, bro?
[98:36.53]Well, you're like 3,500 feet away.
[98:39.29]Exactly.
[98:39.79]You don't want to come do this.
[98:44.43]I'm just going to go get this thing real quick.
[98:46.09]I just need a couple of these real quick.
[98:50.44]Ooh, I defeated my 200th zombie.
[98:52.04]Cool.
[98:53.94]I'm going to need you over here really fast.
[98:57.54]I need help collecting these ebstone blocks.
[99:00.18]Oh, wait.
[99:00.46]I already have 500.
[99:01.46]Never mind.
[99:03.99]So what's the slime god's
[99:07.44]Move set.
[99:09.00]Hold on.
[99:13.14]Do I dodge left or dodge right?
[99:15.93]You have to dodge both.
[99:19.03]That's the crazy thing.
[99:20.43]This deadly boss mod's gonna tell me what to do?
[99:39.14]Have we got, like, a cricket sound effect?
[99:42.47]I'm dealing with a lot in my life, okay?
[99:44.87]You show no respect.
[99:46.63]I give you a lot of space.
[99:48.15]No, I'm talking about, like, no, wow, okay, that's, you had something to say.
[99:51.90]I'm talking about, like, I'm outside right now, and it's, like, it's quiet.
[99:57.88]Oh, boy.
[99:58.90]That was, like, that was a loaded cannon just ready to blow.
[100:01.78]You don't even know!
[100:07.12]Okay, Jerma, this is going to be a hard fight.
[100:08.66]Deep issues.
[100:09.70]Alright, hard fight.
[100:12.18]If you do have any potions or like a buff... I just took my bacon buff.
[100:17.44]That's the best buff there is.
[100:18.41]Here's a potion I threw to you.
[100:20.19]Increases mana regen.
[100:21.97]Yeah.
[100:24.81]Take seven minute duration.
[100:27.37]Alright, I took it.
[100:28.07]Is it going to be tough, you said?
[100:33.27]Yeah.
[100:35.23]If you run too far away from you, they like run at you really fast and like slam you hard.
[100:40.18]So you gotta focus more on dodging rather than running.
[100:42.42]There's two slime blobs that are gonna bounce at you and try and jump on you.
[100:46.64]Right.
[100:47.26]While one like slime orb comes after you.
[100:52.22]So dodging is more important than attacking.
[100:53.64]It's just a lot of shit on the screen.
[100:55.38]We need to kill the big blobs as quickly as we can.
[100:57.80]Big blob as quick as possible.
[101:00.10]Okay.
[101:01.11]I'm ready to give it a try.
[101:05.14]Where do they spawn?
[101:10.33]Usually, you're like, oh, let's build a platform to fight them.
[101:14.27]Now, most bosses we're just doing right here.
[101:16.51]Okay.
[101:22.53]So focus on dodging.
[101:23.61]Dodging is more important than... Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[101:26.61]That's so weird.
[101:27.27]Don't do that.
[101:28.41]I know, I was just curious.
[101:29.41]Wait, what?
[101:30.23]See, because you did it second, now we have three.
[101:32.13]I don't understand why it's like overriding our sentries.
[101:34.66]So you have to do that.
[101:35.58]Just leave him here then.
[101:36.50]Just don't even spawn another one.
[101:38.30]Okay, I need to touch the table.
[101:45.29]Make sure you use your apple.
[101:47.21]I have a burger.
[101:50.48]I've got a bacon already.
[101:51.82]I'm ready.
[101:54.16]Where's he at?
[101:56.72]Okay, so you have to dodge that one.
[101:58.58]Don't worry about destroying that one.
[102:00.31]Brain?
[102:00.65]Oh yeah, and it confuses you and shit.
[102:04.41]It's really annoying.
[102:07.03]So don't get hit by the brain, as you've called it.
[102:09.63]Ouch.
[102:14.20]Ouch.
[102:22.12]Ouch.
[102:23.88]Oh my god, I- I'm not- I'm so slow.
[102:39.07]Oh my god.
[102:40.09]I'm gonna fucking- Let me climb the roof!
[102:44.39]Don't die, don't- just run, just run, just run!
[102:48.09]Nooooo!
[102:49.15]I'm dead.
[102:50.85]god damn it I'm very slow yeah we both are it's kind of a problem because we've never found boots and we even though I've gotten like every single npc in the goddamn game we still never got the cobbler yeah that's too bad I feel like I'm on slash walk right now yeah
[103:20.13]You really can't dodge those things unless you can move faster, I'm assuming.
[103:26.76]There's the thing I just got, that 10% movement speed thing.
[103:31.06]There's also the... If you kill the Eye of Cthulhu on Expert, it gives you a dash you can use.
[103:38.96]That's a pain in the ass, and I do it accidentally more often than I do it intentionally.
[103:44.40]Should we just stack movement speed to do this?
[103:47.42]And forget about any other buff things?
[103:50.55]No.
[103:54.89]I thought there was a person in here.
[103:56.67]I'm like, why is there a guy in here?
[103:57.85]Where's the one that I got?
[104:02.66]Oh, is it not equipment?
[104:05.62]Where is it?
[104:07.44]Right here.
[104:08.90]Yeah, there's 10% movement speed.
[104:10.24]I think it's going to wear it.
[104:11.78]What would I replace this with?
[104:13.52]The bees thing?
[104:14.24]I mean, it's better than nothing.
[104:20.44]use the grappling hook to move quickly yeah but even then we really need like boots or something I'm gonna build rooms and see if the guy shows up minion damage when did I pick up a thousand torches
[104:43.77]What?
[104:45.61]Have I had these for a while?
[104:48.03]This minion damage increased by one is really not a big deal at all, right?
[104:53.61]Not really.
[104:54.13]I'm just gonna wear the anklet then.
[104:56.19]I mean, that's a... When the fuck did you...
[105:12.90]I guess it really is not that big of a difference.
[105:14.70]It kind of is.
[105:18.00]You can craft Hermes Boots with Calamity mod using 10 silk.
[105:23.93]Now, when you- you're talking Hermes Boots.
[105:26.29]Is that like an- you're talking about an item to make or drop or find?
[105:29.51]Oh yeah, you can.
[105:34.64]That's like a 10-step program, too, because we have to make a loom.
[105:39.04]Loom?
[105:40.14]I forgot how to do all... I need, like, lead.
[105:42.18]Cheater mud.
[105:42.92]I need wood.
[105:44.98]Can you just go collect wood?
[105:46.62]Can you go knock down some trees?
[105:49.04]Yeah.
[105:50.78]Yeah, I can.
[105:51.80]Go chop wood, son, please.
[105:53.67]How much do you want?
[105:56.45]Just so much.
[105:59.91]Wait, I need my axe.
[106:00.87]I don't even have an axe.
[106:02.75]Come on, please.
[106:08.19]Wait, there's a piggy bank over here.
[106:09.37]You can use bombs.
[106:12.17]People are telling us to replant the trees.
[106:13.99]Why did you do this?
[106:14.99]Why are you making it harder for me to get in my own house?
[106:18.13]Is there even an axe in here?
[106:39.01]Did we throw away all of our axes?
[106:42.99]Maybe.
[106:43.81]I think we may have.
[106:44.79]Doesn't this guy sell them?
[106:48.70]I'm gonna buy a copper axe.
[106:52.92]Okay.
[106:54.06]Copper axe.
[106:59.50]People are telling me to talk to the guy with the quest.
[107:03.55]Fighting the heat.
[107:06.73]We were in Egypt when he told me about this artifact and it was very hot there.
[107:10.69]Some kind of ice crystal?
[107:13.23]Some kind of ice crystal that can cool things.
[107:15.79]I thought it would be awesome if I could cool down by using it when it's too hot outside.
[107:19.93]I only know that the different ice creatures contain this crystal inside them.
[107:23.79]Can you please find it?
[107:28.25]Okay.
[107:30.05]Find the ice crystal.
[107:33.26]But first, my most important mission is go collect wood for dad.
[107:41.36]That's more important.
[107:43.90]God damn it, Jeremy.
[107:48.21]You're supposed to chop wood, and you didn't.
[107:52.61]Me and your mother need one moment alone.
[108:01.58]So, do you want like a thousand wood?
[108:07.22]Uh, 500 would be like a start.
[108:08.74]Okay.
[108:09.58]I'll just get a thousand.
[108:13.10]And then we're replanting these trees.
[108:18.53]Okay, I've got us the max storage space.
[108:21.31]We've got a lot of space.
[108:22.87]We're doing good on space.
[108:25.25]How do you replant a tree?
[108:27.31]Just kind of acorn?
[108:28.11]Take the acorn and you like eat it and you poop it or something?
[108:41.92]Father makes son get a thousand logs.
[108:50.32]That is at least the second or third, like, pee-pee-poo-poo joke.
[108:54.95]Do you know how old I am?
[108:56.89]I do, actually.
[108:57.57]Alright, you want more than 500.
[109:00.61]Dude.
[109:00.85]You... I...
[109:13.89]Am I doing this wrong?
[109:17.51]Okay, I'm just looking through our storage and I'm finding a lot of things I didn't know we had that are really good things that I should have known we had.
[109:24.92]Yeah?
[109:25.32]Every once in a while.
[109:27.78]Like there was a bat hook, which is just a better version of the hook you already have.
[109:31.84]Oh, cool.
[109:35.20]There was like a 56 damage sword.
[109:39.13]Nice.
[109:41.13]Yeah.
[109:41.51]Yeah.
[109:43.49]Anything else, like, I should know about in here?
[109:46.04]I told you about the weapon in there, and you went, meh.
[109:49.70]Did I?
[109:50.28]Yeah, I said, hey, there's this weapon in here.
[109:51.88]It's, like, cool.
[109:52.56]And you were like, nah, not worth it.
[110:05.42]Does that mean trees are going to be growing over here?
[110:07.99]Oh, and there's also, freaking, you should have a minotaur skull.
[110:10.67]It gives you another summon.
[110:15.06]That's not a helmet, right?
[110:16.20]Okay, yeah, it's not.
[110:18.80]Is it too close?
[110:20.89]You need three blocks in between them, okay.
[110:25.89]Just planting trees out here.
[110:31.52]Can I imitate a boppet, please?
[110:35.62]I think I did that, like, two years ago.
[110:50.07]To get high trees, you need three blocks in between the seeds.
[110:53.01]Alright.
[110:53.23]I'll just put them every so often, you know?
[110:58.79]Alright, I'm gonna have like a thousand wood here soon.
[111:08.92]I currently have 571.
[111:17.84]What?
[111:18.83]No, no, no, no, you don't- I planted torch.
[111:23.35]That's not what I wanted to do.
[111:45.95]Jerma Terraria Jerma Terraria Jerma Terraria with a bunch of PogChamps pog pog pog pog pog pog what's the hardest thing in the whole game alright what's the thing in the game that is so difficult that you have to play perfectly and there's still a random chance that you're going to lose no matter what you do uh the final calamity boss which I can't call me this or something
[112:12.54]calmitis um it's something like that supreme calamite calamitis yeah that's the one have you ever beat it uh my game actually bugged at a certain point in calamity so I never got to the end
[112:28.89]One of the bosses would appear and then run away from me.
[112:31.72]So I just kind of stopped playing.
[112:33.66]Time to operate.
[112:35.40]I forgot about that.
[112:36.20]Sorry, we're just talking about like funny jokes in the stream, you know what I mean?
[112:39.90]Oh yeah, I understand.
[112:41.64]Funny jokes.
[112:50.66]It was like a storm wraith worm that you absolutely 100% need to continue progression.
[112:57.69]Just... would run away.
[113:00.68]For a second I thought that was... it said Jerma has cut down his 50th tree or something.
[113:04.12]I was like, what?
[113:13.86]Did it.
[113:14.74]50th slime.
[113:15.36]I feel like I've killed way more than 50 slimes.
[113:18.64]They just accidentally get in the way and you just chop through them.
[113:26.11]How long does it take for a tree to grow?
[113:31.49]Dude, I don't know.
[113:32.70]Dude, just sit there forever.
[113:34.98]Okay.
[113:37.20]That's what chat wants you to do.
[113:38.56]Chat's been like telling you to plant trees since we started this playthrough.
[113:42.08]So you're going to sit there and you're going to wait until those trees grow.
[113:45.81]Why haven't you planted any trees?
[113:48.39]Because it's a waste of time.
[113:50.01]What?
[113:50.37]What do you mean it's a waste of time?
[113:58.26]Why am I doing this thing?
[113:59.30]If you just walked to your right, there's more trees.
[114:15.41]There's more trees over there.
[114:17.23]Okay.
[114:21.32]Well, I'm coming back with 833 wood.
[114:23.74]Is that enough for you?
[114:26.42]That is more than enough.
[114:28.10]We'll probably never get through that.
[114:29.51]So all the trees you planted?
[114:30.65]Kind of pointless.
[114:32.57]Just throwing it out there.
[114:35.21]Well, it was good to know.
[114:37.15]Yeah, I mean, you learned.
[114:38.61]You learned.
[114:39.11]Next week I'll remind you.
[114:43.89]Here you go.
[114:47.67]Dickhead.
[114:51.94]Don't get it.
[114:54.37]I'm sorry.
[114:54.71]I'll get it.
[114:55.01]I'm sorry.
[114:55.33]I'll go get that.
[114:55.83]I'm sorry.
[114:56.17]That was my fault.
[114:58.35]Wow.
[114:59.54]Wow.

[115:02.54]You want this or not?
[115:08.22]I do.
[115:12.66]I forget why I wanted it.
[115:13.74]Why did we need it?
[115:14.84]I don't know.
[115:15.22]You just made me go do that.
[115:16.17]You said, I need 500, we'll do it.
[115:18.61]500, we'll do it.
[115:20.89]Was that a punishment?
[115:21.87]I just said, like, father, son, you, go chop wood.
[115:24.39]And I don't remember why I wanted it.
[115:26.69]Was that just, you just were punishing me?
[115:29.15]No, I, like, actually needed it.
[115:32.20]But I don't know why.
[115:33.18]Oh, my God.
[115:38.28]The loom, the loom, the loom, the loom.

[118:11.80]Decreases non-minion damage by 10%.
[118:13.36]Is this a helmet?
[118:16.85]It's an accessory.
[118:18.17]Yes, but this is a skull this time.
[118:20.17]No drama.
[118:20.81]No.
[118:21.67]That's a skull?
[118:22.91]We had the same conversation.
[118:24.19]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[118:25.27]A heart is like as big as your fist.
[118:27.17]A minotaur skull is like a huge fucking skull hollowed out.
[118:31.50]We've had this conversation before.
[118:33.16]No, no, no.
[118:33.74]I'm not going to have it again with you.
[118:35.16]No, I refuse to accept that one.
[118:38.72]So what do I replace then?
[118:41.68]This one's 20 mana.
[118:42.50]That's pretty good.
[118:46.27]A Minotaur Scout would, like, would be too big.
[118:49.47]Yeah, real life Minotaurs are like... Get rid of the bees, but it's plus four defense.
[119:04.74]That's a lot.

[119:13.76]Yeah.
[119:15.41]That's okay.
[119:16.71]I wouldn't want to replace that.
[119:18.07]What about the 20?
[119:19.01]Maybe the 20 mana.
[119:21.39]What is 20?
[119:21.81]Yeah, get that out of here.
[119:23.37]It's not... I mean, slowly generate life, but... That's another minion.
[119:30.32]And... I can't... Just put it on.
[119:36.18]Yeah, now I can have like five of these fucking things.
[119:39.42]Get rid of the crappy anklet.
[119:42.18]I remember why we needed wood!
[119:44.22]But... I think it's good.
[119:46.90]Two percent... Uh... Okay.
[119:50.40]Crappy anklet.
[119:51.24]This is good.
[119:55.16]Oh, well, this is pre- Okay, you've- Why do I have candy cane blocks here?
[120:00.46]Isn't that what you wanted?
[120:02.06]No.
[120:05.57]Blood- Do we need any blood drop?
[120:06.73]Green slime?
[120:07.57]I'm just saying literally everything I have.
[120:10.38]Just dump it.
[120:11.11]This person's name.
[120:12.67]Why are you... I just got five community subs from somebody named JermaSucks.
[120:22.44]It's like capital J and capital S, just JermaSucks.
[120:27.58]S-U-C-K-S.
[120:29.15]My man.
[120:31.37]What I...
[120:39.96]Well, thank you, by the way.
[120:41.38]Okay.
[120:47.94]How do I make a loom?
[120:49.06]A sawmill?
[120:50.52]I have 37 gold.
[120:52.50]What am I doing?
[120:53.28]Alright, you wanted me to buy... Okay, I'm gonna buy Man of Regeneration Potion.
[121:01.19]Right?
[121:03.29]I already did it, so you can't tell me no.
[121:05.57]Iron Skin.
[121:06.09]Should I buy, like, a few of each of these?
[121:08.22]Yeah, because you're going to keep using them.
[121:11.60]Iron chain, that's right.
[121:12.84]That's the stupid random thing that you need to make the one time.
[121:15.90]And it makes, oh, let's make 10 chains.
[121:18.09]Like, I'm not destroying the environment by doing this.
[121:20.51]I only need one, but I'll buy 10.
[121:23.43]Thanks for selling it in a pack.
[121:26.01]Obsidian skin potion.
[121:28.49]Light regen.
[121:30.07]Yeah.
[121:33.67]And then it would shine.
[121:35.77]Marmalite in the abyss.
[121:37.07]What's that mean?
[121:39.28]Don't worry about that.
[121:41.10]Oh, spelunker.
[121:42.49]These are expensive.
[121:45.37]Do we need these anymore?
[121:46.19]We don't need spelunkers anymore, do we?
[121:49.05]We will always need them.
[121:50.91]Oh.
[121:51.97]Okay.
[121:53.61]Well, this seems insanely important.
[121:55.37]I'm going to get like ten of these.
[121:57.46]Max number of minions.
[122:00.44]Okay, that looks like a sawmill.
[122:08.68]Am I spending all of our money?
[122:11.21]You're spending a lot of it.
[122:12.31]It's fine.
[122:12.81]We had like 40 gold.
[122:14.73]It's gone.
[122:16.07]I mean, just go through all my expenses.
[122:18.31]What's the big deal?
[122:23.63]It's all gone.
[122:24.79]I used 40 gold.
[122:29.50]This is why you have to get a different box from me.
[122:34.50]Alright, listen.
[122:35.75]Let me tell you something.
[122:36.65]This is a strategy we're going to use.
[122:38.55]Make me a separate box for me to put my stuff in.
[122:42.35]And then you can just go in there.
[122:43.45]Too many of them might crash or cause problems in multiplayer.
[122:46.87]Oh, alright, never mind.
[122:49.12]So I'd rather just have it all in one spot.
[122:51.68]And even then, I think it was making too many slots might be a problem, but I don't know.
[122:56.42]Okay.
[122:56.84]Well, I'm going to... I don't want to press B on some of these.
[123:01.87]You have cobweb.
[123:02.99]You must have like a million cobweb.
[123:05.51]I probably have put like hundreds of it in here.
[123:07.79]Is it in your ammo?
[123:08.85]Sometimes it goes there.
[123:12.95]No.
[123:13.87]I have 12 snowballs.
[123:17.17]I swear to God I had cobweb.
[123:18.19]Did you already take it out of here?
[123:20.37]Yeah.
[123:22.41]Upgrade your copper axe?
[123:23.63]No, I just... Alright, I want this.
[123:25.73]Whatever it is.
[123:26.27]What is this?
[123:27.46]Because that... I want, like, the fucking popsicle.
[123:31.60]Is it... Can you get... Is there one that exists in this game that has blue as well?
[123:35.26]You know, like the rocket popsicles?
[123:37.78]What are you talking... Wait, what?
[123:39.10]Damn.
[123:44.13]Oh my God, I forgot about auto houses...
[123:48.15]Oh my god.
[123:50.59]Kind of irrelevant now.
[123:51.77]Why are there two minotaur skulls in here?
[123:55.63]Because I had more than one.
[123:57.53]I think later on you can combine them with some stuff.
[124:00.45]Let me see how many of these I can have.
[124:04.71]Oh man.
[124:05.75]That's insane.
[124:06.74]Five of these things just flying around.
[124:08.82]Five of these things in two of these sentries.
[124:17.64]Can you stack the skulls?
[124:21.99]I don't think so.
[124:23.19]You sure?
[124:23.75]Can you?
[124:24.11]I mean, I don't see why not.
[124:29.69]Um... Huh.
[124:32.21]Well.
[124:34.23]I've never thought about that.
[124:35.35]No, you can't.
[124:36.13]No, they're unique.
[124:37.43]Oh, well.
[124:44.75]Alright, so I'm going to...
[124:49.49]I've got... I'm pretty much ready to do whatever you want to do.
[124:54.49]I just need to go get one thing real quick.
[124:57.67]Sure you do.
[124:59.37]I'm sure you do.
[125:00.71]If we want to fight the Slime God again, and I personally, that's what I want to do.
[125:05.65]You want to fight Slime God again?
[125:06.92]Okay.
[125:07.52]We need more Blighted Gel.
[125:11.54]Hey, Jeremy, can you give a shout-out to my cat by going... Yeah.
[125:18.06]So I'm gonna go get that.
[125:19.60]Alright, you're gonna go get something real quick?
[125:21.44]Yep.
[125:21.88]Yeah, I'm gonna go get something to eat.
[125:27.27]Combine... Wait, there was an advice, Jupiter.
[125:30.61]Combine the Minotaur skull with your necromancer's heart.
[125:36.47]Really?
[125:37.59]No, I think you also need a soul stone.
[125:40.75]Hold on.
[125:40.95]Wait, what do you mean?
[125:43.19]You might also need a soul stone to make what he's doing.
[125:45.19]Talk to Craft Guy.
[125:46.25]It's Jeffrey.
[125:46.99]And you remember...
[125:49.30]Am I muted or am I talking to you?
[125:51.72]His name's Jeffrey, right?
[125:53.32]I don't remember.
[125:54.10]Ah, sorry!
[125:57.45]Put the Minotaur skull on the crafting thing.
[125:59.55]Okay.
[126:00.27]I need a Soul Stone.
[126:02.39]What is that?
[126:02.95]10% increase minion damage, increase your Mach number of minions, increase your Mach number of sentries.
[126:08.48]Taking fatal damage will instead return you to 20 life every 5 minutes.
[126:13.26]Where do we get a Soul Stone?
[126:17.83]uh we need a mana bauble and blood I think we might have one of those uh search for mana bauble mana bauble yeah oh mana bauble you could just make with 15 arcane dust but the thing we don't have is the goblin to combine trinkets so we can't actually do that yet what
[126:41.38]We have to find the goblin guy.
[126:43.13]Sometimes he's in the dungeon, like, bound, or he's underground, like, tied up, and you need to rescue him.
[126:50.61]He's really important.
[126:55.20]Just make the mana bubble?
[126:57.76]Yeah, you could.
[127:00.59]Might as well do that now.
[127:01.79]So what does it take to do to make a mana bubble?
[127:03.69]What is it?
[127:04.01]How do I put in there?
[127:05.35]Uh, 15 arcane dust, which is you can make from fallen stars.
[127:09.41]Oh, okay.
[127:09.79]I have 10 fallen stars on me right now, so I can, I can basically make it when I come back.
[127:13.85]Uh, I don't think we have any fallen stars.
[127:17.31]Hey, I have a 10 fallen stars on me right now, so I can make it when I come back.
[127:20.89]Yeah, but I wanted to do something because I'm useless.
[127:24.54]I'm just like the guy standing.
[127:25.98]I'm like an NPC in your house.
[127:29.47]We'll do some research.
[127:30.35]You gotta let me fly.
[127:31.59]You gotta let me fly.
[127:33.91]Try and find the goblin guy.
[127:42.25]Get some cobwebs.
[127:44.41]Alright.
[127:46.95]I'm gonna go cobweb hunting.
[127:48.93]Let's kill spiders, I'm assuming, right?
[127:51.41]I already forget why I needed the silk in the first place.
[127:55.58]Tori is like that.
[127:56.34]It's like, okay, I need a loom.
[127:57.50]I need to do this.
[127:58.20]I need to get, I need a sawmill.
[127:59.88]Okay.
[128:00.14]Now I've got this.
[128:00.79]I need cobweb to make.
[128:02.01]Why do I need silk for?
[128:03.41]Oh, for boots to make boots.
[128:06.21]Okay.
[128:06.81]You need to cut a hundred, a thousand wood.
[128:10.75]I need to cut a thousand trees down to summon the goblin.
[128:13.63]Sure.
[128:13.99]Son, go get some cobweb.
[128:15.42]Alright.
[128:17.44]Cobweb comes with spiders.
[128:18.56]Spiders come from underground.
[128:20.60]We can fight the god again.
[128:21.60]Alright.
[128:23.88]Or do you want to get the boots first?
[128:26.98]Let's try it again.
[128:27.68]Let's fight him.
[128:28.58]Let's win.
[128:29.62]I've got extra minions.
[128:30.78]Wait, this is Cobbler.
[128:32.40]The Cobbler!
[128:33.24]Cobbler!
[128:33.92]There he is, right?
[128:35.31]Where is he?
[128:36.29]I don't know.
[128:37.13]Find him.
[128:39.95]Kick your ass.
[128:40.95]Is he in there to kick your ass?
[128:47.11]Oh, he's on the roof.
[128:48.68]Is that him?
[128:49.06]Yeah, that's him.
[128:52.54]I don't think he sells the specific thing we need, though.
[128:58.13]But he does have boots that help you run.
[129:00.29]Whoa!
[129:01.13]What is this stuff?
[129:01.83]Okay, hold on.
[129:02.55]Too bad I spent all... We don't have any money.
[129:07.11]Healthy boots.
[129:08.41]Oh, no, he does sell Hermes boots.
[129:13.43]I think he spent all our money.
[129:17.29]Five gold for Hermes boots, or we can just, like, gather cobwebs.
[129:20.37]I am gathering nothing.
[129:23.19]Find a pig.
[129:23.83]We have 28 gold in the story.
[129:24.97]The Warwick can run super fast.
[129:34.35]Damaging slag drops from below your boots, so Hermes boots are just, you just put them on and never take them off.
[129:41.62]You'll take them off eventually, but... And also, I'm pretty sure we have the stuff to combine with Hermes boots to make lightning boots.
[129:50.78]Let me check on that.
[130:00.29]oh we need the fucking goblin everything everything we need rocket boots and the goblin sells rocket boots and yeah and we couldn't combine without the tinker anyway god damn it dude alright well let's just let's just kill this guy we have like our soup press b before we go let's kill we have upgraded our health didn't last time we fought this guy didn't we only have like 200 health
[130:27.62]Or would that... Am I making that up?
[130:29.22]No.
[130:29.86]You're making that up.
[130:36.46]But we didn't have potions.
[130:38.16]We can beat them with potions.
[130:43.56]You ready?
[130:44.59]Alright, hold on.
[130:46.15]Am I about to press B?
[130:47.07]You take everything, right?
[130:49.87]Yeah.
[130:53.03]Alright, I'm gonna put your sentry down first.
[130:56.97]Did you put one down?
[130:58.47]Yeah.
[131:00.25]Okay.
[131:01.19]Pressing B for potions now.
[131:03.27]Holy fuck, that's a lot.
[131:04.55]And I gotta eat a hamburger.
[131:05.39]Alright, I'm ready.
[131:10.67]I don't have the thing.
[131:12.27]Ugh!
[131:14.57]Why?
[131:16.58]Piggy!
[131:18.32]Um...
[131:19.37]We only have four minutes of these potions.
[131:21.45]What did you do?
[131:22.91]What?
[131:25.97]What is an ebbstone block?
[131:27.81]What do you mean?
[131:28.73]Do I have any?
[131:29.75]I'll be quick.
[131:31.53]Gonna do something real quick.
[131:36.01]Oh, by the way, that was probably like nine gold.
[131:39.09]I'm gonna kill Piggy.
[131:41.07]It lasts for like seven minutes.
[131:42.33]I'll be back.
[131:42.63]No, it doesn't.
[131:42.95]It lasts for four.
[131:45.11]Dude, it's gonna take like two seconds.
[131:50.59]Like, I'm already done.
[131:51.77]Like, I already have it.
[131:53.51]I'm killing the pig.
[131:55.73]Okay, you're putting it to use.
[131:59.10]Good thing I took all these potions to get some gold.
[132:01.02]Yeah, and I turned them all into blocks.
[132:03.38]I need ebestone brick.
[132:04.50]Like, the raw form of it.
[132:07.61]I forgot why I went and got them, I think.
[132:10.57]Oh, wait, no.
[132:12.21]It's a whole thing.
[132:12.83]You know what?
[132:13.13]Just...
[132:19.97]Forget about me.
[132:32.42]You'd be happier if you didn't even know me.
[132:35.78]At least the sentries are still up there.
[132:38.48]Forget about me!
[132:40.50]Okay, I'm ready.
[132:41.36]Did we take enough portions again?
[132:43.49]No.
[132:44.29]No!
[132:44.71]They last four minutes.
[132:45.69]Okay.
[132:51.73]Oh my god, I have a gravity potion.
[132:53.19]It ate my fucking gravity potion.
[133:04.64]Why am I just floating around?
[133:07.51]Because you probably also had a feather fall potion like I did.
[133:10.45]No, I don't think I did.
[133:42.99]Stop bouncing around on me!
[133:44.31]God damn it!
[133:50.81]Ow!
[133:52.01]Ow!
[133:52.15]They're everywhere!
[133:56.60]I'm gonna die.
[134:06.36]Talk to the nurse if you need to.
[134:09.46]I'm... I'm dead.
[134:10.78]I got juggled.
[134:18.69]Oh, gravity potion wore off.
[134:21.77]Okay, this is so much harder when I'm not running.
[134:31.18]Oh, God.
[134:35.75]Just don't die.
[134:36.29]Just don't die.
[134:36.81]Just don't die.
[134:37.35]It's kind of impossible.
[134:38.89]It's impossible.
[134:41.09]It's impossible for me to not die.
[134:48.75]Oh my god.
[134:49.21]I'm just trying to talk to- I can't move!
[134:51.53]No!
[134:57.20]It's still here!
[134:58.12]It's still here!
[134:58.66]We're like this late in the game and I still don't have a weapon I want to use.
[135:03.39]Is it still here?
[135:04.91]No.
[135:12.51]Jeremy gets all the fucking good items.
[135:18.28]There's something dropped over here, though.
[135:22.59]Immunity to... What is a Nazar?
[135:30.93]Ayaya.
[135:31.83]Climb the rope?
[135:35.52]Oh, man.
[135:35.90]It's hard to... When you get hit, you just get juggled.
[135:42.90]What is this thing?
[135:47.50]We had some casualties.
[135:54.23]Make more platforms?
[135:57.25]Yeah, we kind of only have this one platform.
[136:00.13]Should we make, like, two or three other platforms to fall down to and jump to and fall down and jump up?
[136:05.56]Because we're really only, like, one plane.
[136:08.80]Yeah.
[136:11.04]Do it.
[136:12.48]Where's all that wood that I bought?
[136:14.58]I put it in the storage.
[136:16.35]I'm gonna go get a thing real quick.
[136:28.81]Do we just have platforms?
[136:32.59]The wood just turns into platforms.
[136:34.53]Yeah, it just does, right?
[136:42.95]How much should I have, like a couple hundred?
[136:52.69]Yeah, so then we can kind of like jump and fall from plane to plane.
[136:59.55]I think Jerma last stream said building these platforms was cheating.
[137:05.35]Um, did I say that?
[137:06.95]You did.
[137:07.27]I don't remember that.
[137:13.03]Okay, so, theoretically...
[137:16.94]Um, how did you make the... How did you do, like, the little... Oh, it has to be connected to a wall, doesn't it?
[137:24.34]In it?
[137:27.49]Yeah, but how did you do this, though?
[137:28.39]How did you make, like, the little staircase?
[137:31.43]How did you, like, place the stairs?
[137:34.01]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[137:35.31]Oh, there we go.
[137:35.89]Alright, so you gotta be, like, enough to...
[137:49.26]Let's see, like, if we can jump, no, like right here.
[137:54.71]Because if I go like this, right there.
[137:56.71]I can clean that up.
[138:25.93]Okay, yeah.
[138:26.41]See, it's like, so then you can, like, jump up.
[138:27.77]Like, jump up over here, and then up.
[138:30.15]There's more... Because you just can't get away.
[138:31.99]There's too many things to, like, have to dodge.
[138:34.74]They take up the whole space.
[138:38.46]Ralph is here.
[138:38.96]Who's Ralph?
[138:56.45]Okay.
[138:57.83]I'm gonna, like, do... I'm gonna make, like, a... Hold on.
[138:59.59]I'm gonna do a bigger arena.
[139:01.79]You go get... You go get a thing real quick.
[139:04.88]I'm gonna make, like, some space in there.
[139:05.90]I got the soul thing for you so when we finally get Goblin Man... Okay.
[139:17.69]I need more of these.
[139:28.12]All I do is give.
[139:29.58]All I freaking do is give.
[139:31.81]And what does Jerma do?
[139:33.69]Take, take, take.
[139:38.79]Alright, this should be good.
[139:45.71]I see he left.
[139:47.41]That's all he can do.
[139:49.44]I mean, yeah, because, like, what are you even talking about?
[139:51.60]I'm doing stuff here.
[139:52.62]Alright, I'm thinking... Let's do another one.
[139:59.12]We're making an old NES game.
[140:04.29]We're making... What's that game?
[140:05.01]That, like, Burger Town game?
[140:06.81]Burger Time.
[140:08.51]What?
[140:17.74]A goblin army is approaching from the east.
[140:20.96]We're being invaded.
[140:21.58]Oh, no.
[140:23.48]Goblin army.
[140:24.34]No.
[140:29.42]Is this, like, bad?
[140:30.14]Do I have to get over there?
[140:31.58]No.
[140:32.02]It's like the Blood Moon.
[140:32.92]They just keep coming until you kill enough of them.
[140:35.64]And this is... We needed this, right?
[140:37.36]Didn't you say we needed this stuff?
[140:42.89]Oh, no.
[140:43.57]Okay.
[140:46.53]It's so funny that I can look over there and see, like, exactly... You're not even riding the emote.
[140:57.53]Jerma, give me your minotaur skull and your other thing.
[141:00.65]Minotaur skull on the black man's head.
[141:02.73]Okay, buddy.
[141:05.73]Give them to me.
[141:06.77]Alright, hold on.
[141:07.41]Jeez, I'm kidding.
[141:08.15]Give them.
[141:13.23]Fucking idiot.
[141:14.31]Get robbed.
[141:17.99]I'm a summoner now.
[141:27.09]Oh yeah, that's right, you are the summoner now.
[141:28.51]Alright, we have a pretty interesting platform now to like escape stuff and like drop down and escape that and jump here and... I don't know.
[141:48.77]Alright, I'm gonna pee, okay?
[141:51.31]While the goblins invade, he's gonna pee.
[141:53.36]No, fine, I won't.
[141:55.28]I thought you said this wasn't a big deal.
[141:57.96]Yeah, but you have to, like, actually do this one.
[142:03.20]Blood Moon just kind of ends.
[142:04.26]This one has, like, a percentage.
[142:06.14]Oh.
[142:06.28]Is there a boss at the end?
[142:08.60]I would appreciate your help.
[142:10.04]Because all I do is give.
[142:16.03]Just pee my pants.
[142:18.87]Just what?
[142:20.71]Somebody said just pee.
[142:22.09]Just like pee pants.
[142:22.79]Just go to the bathroom.
[142:24.10]Yeah, do it.
[142:28.42]The thing is, I could do that and no one would know I actually did that.
[142:36.84]I mean, you'd probably tell everyone.
[142:44.05]Where's Jerma?
[142:44.67]Jerma, I need you.
[142:45.37]I'm right here.
[142:47.89]Jerma, take this.
[142:52.65]It's the thing!
[142:53.25]It's the thing!
[142:53.83]Oh my god, this is the best birthday ever.
[142:56.61]Thank you.
[142:56.97]Ain't no problem.
[143:01.27]All I do is give.
[143:03.09]Well, to be fair, you did just take that from me before an invasion.
[143:11.85]Sorry?
[143:12.23]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[143:21.86]Stop comparing this game to Minecraft.
[143:23.34]It's way different.
[143:28.08]Nobody wrote any of that.
[143:29.06]I'm just trying to cause constant conflict in the chat.
[143:34.48]That's usually what I'm doing.
[143:37.38]You need some help?
[143:38.26]I can do a better job.
[143:39.56]No, I do not need your help in that.
[143:42.06]Oh, because I'm too good?

[143:55.18]I don't want to hear any of those.
[143:57.95]Alright.
[144:03.89]I guess that's fair.
[144:05.93]I think so, too.
[144:07.59]It's pretty fair.
[144:12.48]So this is, uh, this yew wood?
[144:16.08]Oh, yeah.

[148:48.06]And then at the end of a minecart track, you can change it so you turn and change directions, and you can actually make, like, an in-the-air diamond-shaped minecart that, like, just drives you around in circles.
[148:58.60]It's pretty dope.
[149:03.07]Alright, I'm gonna do one more of these.
[149:04.23]I feel like having, like, four, and then also, just in case you fall, you know, we need some one down here, too.
[149:17.90]This is more for me than it is for you.

[149:32.98]Should I just get them?
[149:34.56]Um... Yeah.
[149:40.86]Especially, you don't even know what they do, so you need to, like, experience what they're doing for you.

[149:52.31]Okay.
[150:03.51]Watch out, bug.

[154:22.73]Okay, he's gonna mute Mike again.
[154:24.34]Why am I gonna mute Mike?
[154:28.64]I don't know.
[154:31.90]He just don't like talking to me, I guess.
[154:33.40]Dun-dun-dun.
[154:35.26]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

[154:54.98]It is too late.
[154:57.20]Get some, uh... Some vodka?
[155:02.12]No.
[155:03.92]I got too much shit to do.
[155:11.97]And yet you're here playing Terraria.
[155:14.76]What is this, like, hourglass-looking design?
[155:19.76]It's a dropper you've made.
[155:21.06]It's just, like, a design.
[155:22.00]Oh, so you're, like, splicing up our lives out here?
[155:25.03]I mean, yeah.
[155:25.45]It's just, like, it's an easy, aesthetically pleasing structure.
[155:30.19]Oh, alright.
[155:39.34]This is good, right?
[155:42.34]We have a lot of places to go.
[155:46.47]I'm gonna do one more down here, but not actually down here.
[156:01.22]Okay.
[156:01.86]Because then it's like, oh no!
[156:03.04]Shit, I fell off!
[156:03.84]Right here!
[156:04.54]It's alright.
[156:07.51]Alright, now I'm gonna go get the boots.
[156:17.70]And put him on.
[156:22.08]Do I have enough money?
[156:24.16]Let's find out.
[156:25.72]I'm a boot master.
[156:26.76]I do.
[156:27.14]I do have enough money.
[156:29.82]Harpoon!
[156:32.10]Is this any good?
[156:40.23]Not really.
[156:41.59]Not really.
[156:45.43]Spike Bomb!
[156:46.71]Cool.
[156:48.74]This U-Wood, I'm just gonna put... Alright, this, uh... I have, like, four jumps.
[156:52.82]Hey, this, um... This, uh, Nazar.
[156:56.86]What is this?
[156:57.94]It's, like, Equippable Immunity to Curse.
[156:59.50]Like, this is just a material.
[157:00.54]They're gonna need it at some point later.
[157:03.52]I don't... remember what Curse is.
[157:06.24]So, I don't know.
[157:08.19]I think it's, like, good for a specific boss, but I forget which status is Curse.
[157:14.29]Dude, look at this thing.
[157:17.61]Look at this thing.
[157:20.89]So what do I replace this with?
[157:22.99]Well, you... No.
[157:24.15]No, okay.
[157:25.85]So... How many minions can I have now?
[157:31.29]Count them up.
[157:36.48]Max entries, max minions.
[157:40.14]I have enough room for another accessory, too.
[157:52.71]Is there anything else I should be putting on?
[157:56.37]What's the one that I have the mana one on already?
[157:58.15]20 mana.
[158:05.63]Boots?
[158:06.33]The boots have boots though, aren't they?
[158:09.71]The boots are new boots?
[158:11.73]They're not an accessory, right?
[158:13.98]You can buy the Hermes boots and buy the rocket boots off the Tinkerer and combine them to make runny, jumpy boots.
[158:26.87]um uh spectre boots yeah but can I put this on oh this is where it gets tricky for me the boots are an accessory they're not actual boots how long is it gonna get them is that guy still on the roof or did you lock him in something uh
[158:57.51]He's on the final room.
[159:02.41]Oh, I don't have the Bank of fucking America mod.
[159:05.87]I don't know... I'm having deja vu.
[159:09.98]What is that?
[159:10.42]I want to go find ice skates.
[159:19.36]Hmm, do we have one?
[159:21.18]Alright, Hermes boots.
[159:25.82]I own them.
[159:35.13]Oh, wow.
[159:36.71]Those are fun.
[159:40.96]Oh, shit.
[159:41.30]You can.
[159:41.84]How do I get out of here?
[159:42.90]Wow.
[159:54.91]You are stuck.
[159:56.57]Please rebuild that wall, though, because that'll stop being a house.
[160:00.65]Okay.
[160:00.81]Okay.
[160:06.47]It'll stop being a house.
[160:09.00]Yeah.
[160:11.46]It's just standard wood to do that, right?
[160:14.82]The wood that you just destroyed, you just picked up.
[160:17.78]Because you destroyed it.
[160:18.98]So you have it.
[160:25.97]I didn't know how that worked.
[160:27.21]I didn't know if it fell.
[160:28.03]Alright.
[160:35.94]Cool, nice hook.
[160:38.16]Cool.
[160:39.86]So now I have the boots.
[160:41.38]I have that cool new item.
[160:43.06]Let me see what I got now for, uh, you know, stuff.
[160:48.17]Get the rocket boots.
[160:49.63]Rocket boots.
[160:50.49]Rocket boots.
[160:52.27]Uh, I think that Tinker is still in the cave.
[160:54.21]Yeah, I would just wait for him to appear, which will just be a while.
[160:57.41]I think we might have to, like, leave this area and come back.
[161:02.62]Okay.
[161:02.76]Okay.
[161:07.50]Ooh, this is just a healing potion.
[161:08.84]100 life versus 50 life.
[161:11.56]How do I make it so... Does it do the better ones first when you press H?
[161:16.64]I think so.
[161:17.75]Oh, it requires an ice machine.
[161:26.43]Okay, I knew it was something.
[161:30.75]Get the sans head from the chest.
[161:33.07]Alright, hold on.
[161:33.55]Let me like just go over what I need to like.
[161:35.27]I just got this new item and shit.
[161:37.79]Hold on.
[161:40.88]So now I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[161:47.10]No, no, no.
[161:47.44]Holy shit.
[161:47.76]I'm an idiot.
[161:48.20]I was like, no way.
[161:50.32]I was like, wow.
[161:52.10]They keep going.
[161:52.84]They just keep spawning.
[161:54.47]You'll get that many later though.
[161:58.86]two sentries and five of these alright so now this what is this this thing 28 magic damage the storm cloud I feel like I'm not using this at all 19 magic damage this looks cool but I'm not using it what about us we have
[162:28.80]Do I just drop those?
[162:30.34]Do we?
[162:34.93]I think I have to use the fucking sand's head.
[162:41.01]Would that be so bad?
[162:42.41]No, I mean, I just don't like using it.
[162:45.83]Why don't you like it?
[162:49.77]I've given you everything, Jerma.
[162:55.12]What's wrong?
[162:56.04]Get the... Do you think I was literally born yesterday?
[163:04.88]I've... I'm gonna save... Oh, yeah.
[163:10.19]What's that?
[163:10.71]Okay.
[163:19.37]I think I have my gear that I want.
[163:27.30]I've got my stuff.
[163:28.50]I'm going to be able to have another one of these.
[163:32.76]Minions, mana regen, life regen, defense, and movement speed is what happens when I press B. So that means I'm going to have a sixth minion.
[163:49.61]We have our arena over here that is being... It's not just one plane.
[163:55.07]You can run around.
[163:55.97]Should I put torches around up here?
[164:02.40]Uh... Put campfires.
[164:03.92]Campfires.
[164:06.66]I don't know how to even make those.
[164:07.60]Which is wood and torches.
[164:10.81]Oh, okay.
[164:13.63]Because campfires give health regeneration.
[164:16.15]I'm gonna just put them everywhere?
[164:20.99]I guess just have campfires everywhere yeah sure alright for 10 or 15 spaces wow that's not specific at all oh yeah we have a star fury hold on
[164:52.02]Yeah, we need those.
[164:54.66]But we basically can make a... God damn it.
[164:56.92]Like, the last time I played Terraria, I did a run with this weapon.
[165:00.48]And I don't want to do the same thing again, but it's such a good weapon.
[165:07.23]Am I not picking those up?
[165:14.21]No, wait.
[165:15.99]Okay.
[165:17.85]That was a yawn voice.
[165:20.73]It was.
[165:22.24]Last time I played this game, I used this weapon, and I really wanted to do it again.
[165:30.74]I'm sorry that I'm boring you.
[165:41.96]Do that again.
[165:44.82]No, don't do it that fast.
[165:46.60]Do it like every, like, do it like every one or, do it every like two or three seconds.
[165:52.40]Good.
[165:53.06]Keep going.
[165:55.39]Okay.
[165:55.55]That's great.
[165:55.93]That's... Ah!
[165:56.27]That's great.
[165:56.65]That's just... Wow.
[165:57.29]Wow.
[166:21.81]That's great.
[166:22.81]Alright.
[166:23.47]There's a lot of fires up here.
[166:30.70]I love these.
[166:34.22]Okay.
[166:35.60]Here's what we're going to do.
[166:36.64]Yep.
[166:37.96]We're going to fight this thing one more time.
[166:39.98]Okay.
[166:40.64]Hold on.
[166:40.86]Let me just do... Ow.
[166:42.92]Stop hitting me.
[166:44.26]There's a rope here.
[166:49.62]Should I do, like, a Donkey Kong Tropical Breeze, whatever the name of that game is, and have, like, vines to, like, climb on?
[166:58.35]Uh... Probably not.
[167:02.69]If they, like, hit you while you're on a vine, you get really... Unless we can... I think you can craft cobalt shields in this.
[167:08.21]That would actually be really helpful.
[167:10.31]But I don't know how to do it.
[167:11.09]They're saying, hang heart lanterns.
[167:22.29]Yeah, just in case you, like, get, like, you know what I'm saying?
[167:24.23]Jump, jump, jump, like, from vine to vine.
[167:29.27]You're gonna try and do that during the fight?
[167:31.51]You think you want it, but you don't.
[167:33.54]But what if, but just what if there's a reason?
[167:35.42]What if it happens?
[167:36.20]What if you just fight?
[167:37.50]What if you just have a scenario where that works?
[167:41.66]You think you want it.
[167:42.72]Alright, so... I think we have a decent area here.
[167:57.72]but you don't okay here take this I don't want it glass I don't want to make glass dude but I like need to really bad
[168:46.83]So, um... Chat is... You're making fun of me for, like, doing... Like, picking up shitty stuff.
[168:53.53]But somebody said they're watching the other stream.
[168:56.63]And they're saying that your inventory looks fucking stupid right now.
[169:00.79]Like it's being spammed.
[169:03.21]What?
[169:06.27]Like, you're like, oh, you're picking up, like, dumb shit.
[169:07.91]Like, stuff we don't need.
[169:08.83]And somebody's saying that in your inventory you have, like, a bunch of trash.
[169:13.10]Is this true?
[169:13.56]No.
[169:15.11]I mean like one or two things what is it it's not a big deal what do you have in your inventory that's like so much a problem throwing knives jester arrows I don't know why do you have jester arrows because I picked them up wanna fight about it
[169:43.85]I forgot what I was looking for here.
[169:46.12]Wait, does he have like auto trash?
[169:51.16]Nobody said that.
[169:52.16]Drama making shit up.
[169:53.52]Constant conflict.
[169:54.66]I was taking stuff out of our bank and throwing it at you.
[170:00.89]And I think I might have just deleted a bunch of stuff because you have it on auto delete.
[170:06.17]What?
[170:07.25]I've been throwing shit at you while you were staring at like nothing.
[170:11.19]Oh, yeah, then I was probably just fucking deleting it if you were throwing, like, really stupid shit at me.
[170:18.62]Like, what did you throw at me?
[170:19.76]I don't remember.
[170:20.38]It might have been... There was a magnum bullet?
[170:23.18]You threw magnum rounds at me?
[170:25.38]Like, I know you don't need them.
[170:31.29]Flaming arrows?
[170:32.25]Like, okay, let's fight this fucking boss.
[170:34.53]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[170:35.33]Get ready for it.
[170:37.86]Wait, I need those.
[170:39.84]I gave you something.
[170:40.48]I need them back.
[170:41.96]What do you need?
[170:42.58]I don't know.
[170:42.88]The thing that shoots the bee.
[170:44.96]The bee gun.
[170:48.08]I gave you, like, ammo.
[170:49.46]Wooden arrows?
[170:52.79]You gave me 500 wooden arrows.
[170:54.27]Here you go.
[170:55.09]Here's your trash bag.
[170:56.25]Thank you.
[170:57.93]Okay, right.
[170:59.01]Touch this.
[171:04.09]Hold on.
[171:04.49]I need to get to this.
[171:06.45]Um...
[171:09.49]So we're doing the same thing.
[171:12.29]Just touch the thing.
[171:13.05]I'm going to spawn all my friends.
[171:16.88]Just let me know when you are ready to do this.
[171:21.62]Do that thing.
[171:22.52]Okay.
[171:27.48]I'm ready.
[171:27.88]Okay, let's go.
[172:03.42]You just build platforms?
[172:04.39]Oh my god, I have another gravity potion.
[172:12.65]That's so annoying.
[172:37.75]Is this, like, cheating?
[172:39.28]Stop!
[172:40.28]I'm concentrating.
[172:47.28]But it's cheating, though, right?
[172:49.62]Stop it!
[172:51.64]Can we do it?
[172:56.41]Grenade.
[172:59.57]Shell.
[172:59.93]Ooh, what was that?
[173:00.49]That was huge.
[173:00.97]That was all the... The slime god.
[173:05.32]Oh, yeah, it gives you this stupid item.
[173:07.70]It's going to give you a place in your inventory that permanently makes you slippery.
[173:12.39]Oh, yeah.
[173:13.89]I hate this.
[173:14.77]How do I get rid of this?
[173:16.35]Just delete it.
[173:19.21]Get rid of that.
[173:20.01]But what does it do?
[173:21.31]He gives purified gel, which is a crafting thing.
[173:23.53]Some stuff.
[173:27.06]Does this have any purpose at all?
[173:29.64]No.
[173:30.16]None.
[173:35.45]don't even put this in the in just throw it away no because you are you ever going to want to slide around I mean can I slide around and do like a thousand damage a second no alright I threw it away you can slide into my dms though what
[174:07.41]Oh, frog leg.
[174:12.21]Okay.
[174:17.31]A long time ago, you told me about this weapon, this Arcalus.
[174:23.18]Yeah.
[174:23.44]And, oh, you can turn it into something eventually.
[174:25.96]Yes.
[174:26.68]We need to be in hard mode to finish it.
[174:28.88]Okay.
[174:30.84]It is a really, really, really good weapon, though.
[174:32.62]But we would just need to kill Wall of Flesh, and then we could basically build it.
[174:37.80]Okay.
[174:39.64]He put the slime god shit in the chest.
[174:41.70]What shit?
[174:42.12]What did you do?
[174:43.84]Well, what a bunch of fucking tattletales.
[174:47.71]Really?
[174:49.41]Am I being pranked right now?
[174:50.73]No, I just, I put the slime god thing in the box to save it in case, just in case we wanted it.
[174:57.36]That's not trolling me.
[174:58.42]That's trolling yourself.
[175:00.22]No, it's not.
[175:02.50]What if we want to use it?
[175:03.78]He put it, he put it in the box!
[175:09.91]This is why we shouldn't be squad streaming right now.
[175:14.17]You know what?
[175:14.63]Communication is key.
[175:16.63]Eventually it all comes out.
[175:17.93]Somebody said get, uh, get carnage.
[175:22.23]Carnage?
[175:24.65]Uh, carnage is a sword that I have.
[175:27.66]Oh, you have it.
[175:29.42]Why, does it make something?
[175:31.38]Get carnage from storage.
[175:33.96]Nah, I have it.
[175:36.24]Why do you need it?
[175:37.16]I don't know, somebody just wrote in all caps, like, get it.
[175:39.54]Okay, we'll ignore that guy.
[175:42.97]I don't know, just people have thrown out ideas.
[175:49.69]He reads the one guy that says carnage, but not the spam for the rocket boots.
[175:55.48]I can't even make the rocket boots because the goblin isn't up here.
[175:58.12]Is he?
[176:00.18]He's up here now.
[176:00.77]He's this blue guy in a skirt.
[176:03.83]I can do it now.
[176:05.07]I couldn't do it before.
[176:06.06]I would have to go... There was a reason why I've been waiting.
[176:09.93]So reforge, right?
[176:14.11]No, reforge is to reforge the random stat.
[176:16.47]What you're doing is shopping because he has rocket boots.
[176:19.45]Allows flight.
[176:20.47]And then I combine the rocket boots and the Hermes boots.
[176:24.67]This table right here is the combining table that you're standing in front of right now.
[176:29.16]So yeah, you can combine rocket boots and Hermes boots to make Spectre boots.
[176:33.24]Okay.
[176:34.82]And then I think you can combine Spectre boots and Zephyr, which I will give you even though I was using it.
[176:42.19]And then you can make Lightning Boots.
[176:43.51]The Wera can run super fast.
[176:45.71]So I've got Hummer's Boots, Rocket Boots, Specter Boots, and then Specter Boots and... whatever you just threw to me... makes another one.
[176:52.61]Makes Lightning Boots.
[176:57.28]Okay.
[177:00.32]Lightning Boots.
[177:01.94]Allows flight.
[177:02.86]The Wera can run incredibly fast.
[177:07.52]Wow, this is cool.
[177:08.32]Alright.
[177:09.32]Let's go.
[177:09.64]And then the next thing that I did, I... What?
[177:12.12]There's more?
[177:12.50]You need to also get some shit to make Frostbark boots.
[177:18.67]It just keeps going.
[177:20.35]Is this Monster Hunter or is this Terraria?
[177:24.15]A bit of both.
[177:25.37]Holy shit.
[177:33.23]I could... How much... They're like little bunny slippers.
[177:39.09]That's the takeaway.
[177:40.31]They're bunny slippers.
[177:43.01]Oh, this is like... This is great.
[177:45.21]Oh, are you talking about Carnage Ray?
[177:46.66]The like staff?
[177:54.98]We can probably make that.
[177:55.86]I think we have most of this.
[177:58.65]I'm too lazy.
[177:59.17]Yeah, this is not that fast though.
[178:04.40]I mean, it cues up, and you go, you have to be running for a while for this to work.
[178:12.54]Yeah, if you use your grappling hook, you instantly get to run the speed.
[178:15.73]Oh, really?
[178:16.27]Okay, didn't know that.
[178:18.91]Let me test that.
[178:26.19]Preferably on the ground.
[178:30.09]Alright, so we're walking, we're walking, we're walking.
[178:34.63]Oh, dude, this is actually probably what you should be making.
[178:37.79]This would be very good.
[178:39.97]I see, okay.
[178:46.12]You gotta release the hook first, yeah.
[178:48.12]Alright, I get it.
[178:48.80]Aw, goobo!
[178:53.78]So, ah, these are cool.
[178:58.89]Hey, why'd you kill that boar?
[179:00.07]There was no reason to kill that boar.
[179:08.56]Here we go!
[179:12.21]Oh, that's so fun.
[179:26.32]I wasn't making a joke.
[179:27.16]I just wanted to say, here we go.
[179:29.10]Alright.
[179:32.47]What do you want to do?
[179:35.23]One second, I'm reading something.
[179:37.72]We kind of need Hellstone, but also we can kind of just honestly skip a lot of this if we just kill the Wall of Flesh.
[179:44.92]What else can this be turned into?
[179:48.04]Frost Spark Boots.
[179:49.65]Lightning Boots and Ice Skates.
[179:52.75]Okay.
[179:53.99]Allows flights super fast running and extra mobility on ice.
[179:57.07]7% increased movement speed.
[179:58.53]Where do you get the Ice Skates?
[180:03.22]Um, you can make ice skates out of leather and ice blocks.
[180:08.28]Leather and ice blocks?
[180:11.32]Okay.
[180:18.51]Without these on, I don't think I would play the game.
[180:21.89]I'm just realizing how slow that is.
[180:23.29]Yeah.
[180:28.95]wow it doesn't feel like an immediate it is that's huge you can never go back now there's a couple things we can do like because we killed that boss we have a material that can make a bunch of stuff and a lot of it's good
[181:14.55]Yeah, my internet's not up.
[181:15.93]I don't know.
[181:21.94]That was weird.
[181:23.00]No, my internet's fine.
[181:26.70]That wasn't like my internet.
[181:29.64]That was weird.
[181:33.08]Was it?
[181:33.40]It's Twitch.
[181:34.51]Oh.
[181:36.51]Not my Twitch.
[181:38.71]Huh.
[181:40.64]It was Twitch's fault.
[181:42.18]Oh, maybe the server, like, ingest server screwed up?
[181:45.06]Not my Twitch.
[181:46.22]Twitch took manual control.
[181:47.88]Alright, well, you guys... Yeah, I didn't leave the game, right?
[181:53.14]Like, my internet, I was still in the game.
[181:54.90]I don't think you did, but usually, I mean, it takes a while if you were going to drop.
[181:58.37]I just assumed you were, like, basically gone.
[182:03.01]But I think you're still here.
[182:04.79]I guess it was just a weird, like, server issue or something.
[182:08.57]But we're here.
[182:09.45]What do you want to do?
[182:12.43]I really want to make a bow.
[182:14.01]I need some Hellstone.
[182:15.05]You can help me mine Hellstone, and then we can kill the Wall of Flesh.
[182:18.79]Okay.
[182:19.37]I don't know if that sounds like a plan.
[182:20.96]Hellstone's a huge pain in the ass to mine.
[182:23.30]Hellstone.
[182:24.62]I'm remembering.
[182:25.40]And I didn't get an Obsidian Potion.
[182:29.16]You should buy an Obsidian Potion.
[182:30.70]Buy an Obsidian Potion.
[182:33.18]Yeah.
[182:37.94]Which is what I should have done, but I can't return because I don't have a fucking mirror.
[182:41.13]Do we have any?
[182:44.08]We might, but I mean the potion seller will sell them.
[182:47.86]Oh, potion seller?
[182:50.36]Give me your finest potion.
[182:52.88]I wasn't going to do it.
[182:54.16]I wasn't going to do it.
[182:55.26]Oh, man.
[182:55.90]Yeah.
[182:56.56]How many of these do you want?
[183:00.08]Bring me one.
[183:00.82]So bring like two or three or four.
[183:04.94]I can afford three.
[183:09.08]Obsidian skin potion, right?
[183:11.36]Yep.
[183:12.18]Just making sure I got the right thing.
[183:14.55]Alright.
[183:15.56]Do we have any of those wormhole potions?
[183:19.14]I don't think I have any.
[183:20.96]You can buy some from that guy as well.
[183:23.26]Oh, okay.
[183:23.82]I'll get some.
[183:28.85]Alright.
[183:29.63]Let me buy a couple of those.
[183:34.69]Wormhole.
[183:35.43]It's where, where, where?
[183:37.31]There they are.
[183:41.07]Alright.
[183:41.49]I am going to teleport to you in just a few seconds.
[183:44.61]In just a few moments.
[183:45.47]Okay.
[183:46.25]I'm bracing myself.
[183:48.22]I'm standing over lava.
[183:49.62]In a moment.
[183:51.20]Okay, so get somewhere safe.
[183:53.24]I'm safe.
[183:53.88]You're safe?
[183:55.10]Yes.
[183:56.12]Okay.
[184:01.29]Where the fuck are you?
[184:02.95]Oh.
[184:03.63]Here we go.
[184:06.30]I have brought... Excuse me.
[184:10.47]I have brought you... I'm going to drink one of these, right?
[184:14.75]Okay.
[184:15.41]And then... You can do that.
[184:17.66]Here you go.
[184:19.72]Oh, fuck!
[184:22.78]How do I throw it?
[184:24.50]Right click?
[184:24.84]Okay.
[184:31.97]okay so hellstone is these rocks down here uh if you stand on them even with obsidian potion you'll still take damage and it won't make any noise your character won't scream you'll just slowly die and it's one of the worst things okay so uh the deal is what are we trying to mine these ones I don't know I just I just don't know what are we don't know I mean like what what are we what's the goal what are we trying to get if you said
[185:00.70]Hellstone.
[185:01.28]We're mining the hellstone, and it'll hurt you if you stand on the hellstone.
[185:04.72]So that shit's hellstone.
[185:13.41]Can you drown in lava?
[185:14.25]No.
[185:16.53]Can you drown in lava?
[185:18.64]Should I try to get some of that shit over there?
[185:23.46]Is that gonna burn me?
[185:25.60]You can stand in the lava for seven seconds with the obsidian potion.
[185:30.18]Just make sure you don't actually stand on the hellstone, because it will still hurt you.
[185:34.26]Okay.
[185:45.10]Pretty sure.
[185:47.02]Okay.
[185:48.78]How much does this do we need?
[185:49.54]The poor guy occasionally blacks out during conversation.
[185:54.09]I'm...
[185:55.69]We're worried about you.
[185:56.41]Do you have any hobbies?
[185:57.11]Do you get out there?
[185:57.91]Do you get enough exercise?
[185:59.27]No, it's just a lot going on for my second time ever playing Terraria.
[186:08.82]Come on.
[186:10.02]You have like 6,000 hours in this game.
[186:13.26]This is the second time I've ever played it.
[186:14.96]It has nothing to do with how much Terraria you've played.
[186:17.60]Yes, it is.
[186:18.14]It's how much you listen to people when they talk to you.
[186:21.10]It's a lot of information to process.
[186:32.63]He was busy reminiscing about the 50s.
[186:34.61]At least someone's honest.
[186:59.58]Can you delete lava?
[187:02.70]Is it like a Minecraft way to block it?
[187:06.44]No.
[187:07.68]I mean, if you just build around it.
[187:10.82]Also, yeah, Hellstone creates lava when you mine it.
[187:15.57]It's a thing that's happening.
[187:19.07]I think this potion is going to run out here in a second.
[187:23.87]I have 55 seconds.
[187:24.67]What was I doing?
[187:30.66]I was
[187:34.41]How much do I have?
[187:36.15]17.
[187:36.17]40 seconds.
[187:47.66]Also, we need a platform that goes from left to right a very far distance down here so that we can fight the wall of flesh.
[187:58.11]I have like 20.
[187:58.59]I'm not going to risk going down there anymore.
[188:06.99]What's that?
[188:13.89]There's something there.
[188:14.63]I'm not opening that up.
[188:15.61]I'll just drown.
[188:17.11]Work on Operation Left and Right Platform.
[188:20.66]Okay.
[188:21.76]Like, towards where you are now?
[188:25.50]Either direction works, honestly.
[188:27.14]Sounds like I don't have any wood with me.
[188:32.52]Can I not fly down here?
[188:34.40]Or do I have to be running to fly?
[188:38.39]Uh, you should be able to fly.
[188:48.69]Hmm.
[188:48.91]Hold space?
[188:49.53]What the fuck?
[188:51.17]Yeah, I was holding it.
[188:51.81]That was weird.
[188:54.09]I did it a third time.
[188:55.35]Okay.
[188:55.47]Alright.
[188:59.67]Um, uh, how safe is it over to you right now?
[189:03.46]I can't really tell.
[189:04.50]It's safe.
[189:06.02]I've got platforms starting to go this way.
[189:09.20]I'm afraid I need, because there's like lava and shit.
[189:18.35]Oh, no.
[189:21.41]Not the lava.
[189:23.73]Okay.
[189:24.85]I am coming over there.
[189:26.81]I'm assuming you already got all these chests, right?
[189:30.57]Uh, no.
[189:31.15]We can't open those.
[189:32.35]We can't open these.
[189:34.42]unless you have a shadow key I remembered getting a shadow key but I like don't have a character we don't have one in our stash but you need a shadow key to open these I swear we got one though I'm swearing it's so hard I'm swearing it how are you yeah obsidian door oh my god what have I done
[189:59.38]It's okay.
[190:00.64]There was, like, lava.
[190:02.40]There was lava, like, in the room.
[190:04.30]Did you, like, pull a little lava in here?
[190:06.49]The, um... The lava slimes.
[190:09.77]Oh, okay.
[190:10.71]Makes sense.
[190:11.55]Can you give me all the health stone you got?
[190:13.81]Yes, I will.
[190:15.13]Here you go.
[190:22.38]I'm assuming we're gonna fight something down here.
[190:23.80]If I were betting on it.
[190:32.00]So do not... Last time I opened one of these chests, our games froze.
[190:36.52]So we cannot... There's no way to open them.
[190:38.14]We need like special keys or something, right?
[190:40.38]We need a key.
[190:42.46]Did you say you're going to give me... Yeah, come here.
[190:54.20]We want it to be at one level, not, like, multiple levels.
[190:57.04]So just, like, going in a straight line.
[190:58.44]Okay.
[190:59.40]You want me to go the other way, or do you want me to just keep going with you this way?
[191:03.80]Like, do you want me to, like... Let's just both go the same direction.
[191:06.47]Both go the same direction?
[191:10.13]Did you give me the... You did, you did.
[191:12.07]You would platform this.
[191:24.99]Aye yai yai.
[191:27.17]Aye yai yai.
[191:37.38]So alright, you can just let it drop here.
[191:41.38]Walk across.
[191:45.51]There is a thing that will come at you, and it will move towards you forever, and you can't go behind it.
[191:51.59]So you need a lot of, like, backing up space.
[191:54.70]Okay.
[191:54.90]There's, like, a flame wall or something that comes over here?
[192:00.10]A flesh wall.
[192:01.38]Oh, it's the wall of flesh itself.
[192:02.92]It's the actual wall of flesh.
[192:06.18]Yeah, it's not just a nickname.
[192:08.97]That's its real name.
[192:10.47]That's what it is.
[192:11.13]It's not, like, what they call me when I go to the gym or anything.
[192:14.05]Ha ha ha!
[192:21.70]Alright, I'm going to make sure I have my summons.
[192:24.05]Can you, like, do something?
[192:29.35]I thought, well, I was waiting to see what... I've never done this before.
[192:33.23]I don't know.
[192:33.57]How far do we need to go?
[192:35.31]Very far.
[192:36.17]Very far.
[192:37.63]Very far.
[192:45.85]I thought we were working together, you know?
[192:57.11]I didn't do that.
[193:13.38]That was you who did.
[193:21.42]okay so just keep going let's just keep we should actually go the other direction because this is where we come down this way is easier
[193:44.25]Yep.
[193:46.33]Uh, somebody gave $50 to you.
[193:48.75]He said, Hey, Ster, thanks for the stream.
[193:50.19]It's been hilarious.
[193:50.97]This Jerma guy's kind of a psycho.
[193:52.60]LOL.
[193:55.40]That was from Shining Path.
[193:58.00]Nice.
[194:00.70]Yeah, man, thank you, Shining Path.
[194:03.10]For the $50, by the way.
[194:11.55]That's a lot of fucking money.
[194:12.49]Thank you.
[194:14.28]to star thank you thank you to star yeah no problem I mean like I'm the highlight of the stream you know I'm like I'm like woke ow oh come on really you knocked it over oh my god is this truly the legendary blade
[194:42.22]I have such shit weapons this whole game, I'm probably gonna need something better.
[194:46.94]Is this thing any good?
[194:53.87]No, it's not.
[195:01.73]Did they kill the wall of flesh yet?
[195:03.45]That's a... That's a question.
[195:05.85]I'm almost out of platform.
[195:09.83]I got no more!
[195:12.28]Here.
[195:12.50]Take.
[195:15.23]Thanks.
[195:15.73]Keep going.
[195:16.35]I'll defend you.
[195:17.67]I'll put that to good use.
[195:30.72]I should make a funny trap so when he comes over here one time, he'll fall in and we fight the boss.
[195:35.32]So, this is activating hard luck.
[195:40.75]Essentially.
[195:41.49]After this.
[195:41.85]This is like the final thing you do.
[195:45.28]Where it becomes hard mode.
[195:48.94]You don't even know what that means.
[195:50.60]I don't.
[195:51.28]I mean, I know it just means the game is harder now.
[195:56.02]Don't do it.
[195:56.60]Don't do it.
[195:57.35]Don't do it.
[195:57.87]What are you talking about?
[196:01.85]What is going on?
[196:11.93]uh don't touch that ground will hurt you so just be sure you don't stand on it yeah uh you keep doing what you're doing I'll be back I'm gonna try and make this bow before we fight it because my weapons have been garbage this whole game and you know I'm just kind of sick of it I feel like I deserve happiness as much as anyone else how come I keep putting myself before other people is lava ever gonna go away
[196:43.46]I'm trying to like drop it.
[196:48.15]Hey, look at that.
[197:06.80]This feels so odd doing this.
[197:09.54]I'm out of platforms again.
[197:11.62]Oh, well... I'm going all the way over here.
[197:15.84]It's also better if you do it with just like bricks.
[197:18.96]So if you have any random bricks like dirt or something.
[197:21.47]I mean, I have like... I have obsidian brick.
[197:25.37]Yeah, just go for it.
[197:26.71]Go wild.
[197:27.49]Just do it with a brick?
[197:30.13]Yep.
[197:31.69]Will it be, like, on the same plane?
[197:34.41]I guess so.
[197:36.89]I didn't know if it, like, caught the top of the, um... The lip of the wood, like, the platforms.
[197:45.74]What?
[197:46.50]Can I just make obsidian platforms right now?
[197:48.52]Oh, fuck.
[197:49.12]Yeah, just go.
[197:50.26]Just go, just go, just go.
[197:58.40]Just go!
[197:59.40]I'm going.
[198:05.37]What are you waiting around for?
[198:06.65]I'm not.
[198:10.13]I just touched it.
[198:11.37]Ow.
[198:11.61]Somebody just threw like a fucking boomerang at me.
[198:15.69]Kill this guy.
[198:16.71]Not you.
[198:17.35]My minions, they're just hanging out in here.
[198:19.47]What are you guys doing?
[198:25.31]They've trapped themselves.
[198:27.35]Alright, I need to... Oh, you idiots.
[198:39.74]I'm on new minions now.
[198:42.07]You guys blew it.
[198:45.05]Once we go into hard mode, we can actually get you, like, an absurdly overpowered minion.
[198:50.50]Really?
[198:51.70]Yeah.
[198:52.78]It will, like, autopilot the rest of the game for you for, like, a long time.
[198:57.72]If you're into that sort of thing.
[198:59.23]It tracks minions...
[199:01.44]through walls like very slightly off your screen it just kills everything really it's nuts yeah I feel like that's would that be fun though I used to use it it was kind of fun I mean it's like fun to not be annoyed what is it um nothing nothing's the matter
[199:33.24]You're doing great, honey.
[199:34.52]Thanks.
[199:35.22]I need to fight a boss.
[199:36.56]What's the matter, actually?
[199:37.70]Any more demonite?
[199:40.38]I'm almost out of, I think, ways to make platforms.
[199:48.51]Frog.
[199:49.85]Star.
[199:50.17]I'm almost out of platforms.
[200:09.67]Get out of here.
[200:10.69]I'm fucking busy.
[200:13.21]Okay.
[200:19.91]What else do we got?
[200:25.40]I do have... I have ash blocks.
[200:28.08]Can I make, like... Yeah, that works.
[200:31.04]That works too?
[200:31.52]They're not going to fall?
[200:33.22]Mm-mm.
[200:34.84]It's like silt and sand that fall.
[200:37.74]I think that's it.
[200:46.34]Oh my god, these guys are throwing the fucking boomerangs.
[200:50.34]Where are my friends?
[200:51.34]I thought I could trust you guys.
[201:02.91]Why didn't I come here?
[201:04.13]Oh.
[201:04.49]I'm such a fucking idiot.
[201:13.50]Oh, you guys are dunking into the water.
[201:16.28]The very hot water.
[201:18.10]To kill the worm.
[201:19.30]I get it now.
[201:21.10]The Eater of Worlds has awoken.
[201:24.75]Zar?
[201:25.93]Yeah.
[201:27.79]That's the boss.
[201:28.55]We already fought this boss.
[201:29.57]I just need more resources.
[201:33.70]the side just comes up and swallows me like the big fish in Mario is there why is it is there a reason why this has 8 am 8 am though I am officially out of materials besides like uh yeah I have no more like materials to keep this going
[202:04.28]okay back to town it might be enough I think we're pretty pretty buff normally you can kill wall of flesh if you just walk backwards and throw dynamite on the ground which dynamite falls through platforms so we can't really do that in all the spots I'm just testing my work to make sure we can go right through it we just need to walk run backwards right yeah because I'm just making sure that there's plenty of space there's no holes
[202:33.87]You know, I'm just checking my work.
[202:39.00]It's pretty good.
[202:41.82]She seems like there's... Wait, there's a hole right there!
[202:44.02]Uh-huh!
[202:45.10]This is why you check your work!
[202:47.45]The, um... Sometimes the lava slimes will create lava when you kill them, and they'll, like, rip a hole in the platform.
[202:52.93]This is why you check your work.
[202:56.49]Okay.
[202:57.55]I think, uh... So I'm just gonna come back to you.
[203:03.27]That sounds, that sounds great.
[203:08.71]Hello.
[203:10.24]What do we got?
[203:10.82]Fuck, I need those potions.
[203:16.32]A lot of apples.

[203:22.04]Oh, come on.
[203:27.72]Is it raining presents?
[203:31.11]Okay, I don't need it.
[203:31.89]It's raining presents from the sky.
[203:33.91]Yeah, it's raining, um, limes that are dying and turning into presents.
[203:38.56]What?
[203:38.90]That's awesome.
[203:41.76]Sometimes during this, uh, Slime King period.

[203:45.94]That's cool.
[203:49.92]Uh, can I have that bee bow?

[217:26.51]I don't like it, but it's doing more damage than what I have, so.
[217:29.47]Okay.
[217:30.71]Well, then yeah, you can come down here.
[217:33.65]Okay.
[217:37.91]I'm coming.
[217:43.68]Oh, why did I save her?
[217:54.05]I don't know who it was, and then I clicked on her, and then I should have known.
[218:02.41]So is there a certain thing we do to summon this thing?
[218:05.91]Yes.
[218:07.09]Cool.
[218:07.39]Let me break it down like this.
[218:08.89]Break it down.
[218:11.69]Which button do I have to press?
[218:16.99]9-1-1.
[218:17.63]I show up within like 15 minutes.
[218:21.71]You are down here.
[218:23.62]Come all the way to the right.
[218:25.74]Yes.
[218:37.01]Coming.
[218:44.92]Coming.
[218:55.23]That sounds like you're stepping in snow.
[218:56.55]I like this sound.
[218:59.39]Ow.
[219:00.43]Dude, this is actually so good.
[219:04.53]Who the fuck is this?
[219:05.85]No, that's Yo-Yo.
[219:06.57]Never mind.
[219:08.07]What'd you just drop?
[219:09.93]Vanquisher metal?
[219:11.99]Ignore it.
[219:12.83]Oh.
[219:13.73]Never mind.
[219:15.31]Okay.
[219:22.48]So, um...
[219:26.67]I think this might need to be longer.
[219:29.34]Longer?
[219:30.92]Yeah.
[219:32.70]I'm concerned.
[219:33.58]Alright.
[219:38.60]Grats on 150 health, Batkills.
[219:40.19]Thank you.
[219:42.31]You're still not at 400 health, are you?
[219:44.29]No.
[219:49.33]350.
[219:49.43]I didn't bring any, like, building materials or anything.
[219:55.27]This is, you know, this is still not long enough.
[220:00.79]Uh, how long does this gotta be?
[220:03.06]It might be, but I want to be sure.
[220:04.26]Cause if you reach the end and the boss isn't dead yet, then you're like in a panic jumping over lava pits and stuff and like trying to work your way through houses while it kills you.
[220:13.80]Well, I'm just going to start grabbing material then.
[220:20.37]Either it's long enough or it isn't.
[220:22.05]Yeah.
[220:25.02]And I'd rather it be long enough, you know?
[220:36.18]I'm probably just gonna dynamite it, actually.
[220:37.60]We're normal and we should be fine.
[220:38.84]Alright, so... Once we get to the other side of this building, we'll do it.
[220:49.99]Okay.
[221:06.80]This is relaxing.
[221:09.36]I'm going for it.
[221:10.12]I'm building the thing up.
[221:12.81]No, we're good.
[221:13.57]We're good.
[221:15.93]Just come here.
[221:16.61]Wait, we're done doing it?
[221:17.45]We're good?
[221:17.73]Yeah, yeah, just come here, come here.
[221:19.25]Alright.
[221:20.71]Hand to me gently the voodoo doll.
[221:27.97]And the obsidian potion.
[221:29.27]Okay, gently hand you the voodoo doll.
[221:34.51]There it is.
[221:35.60]Okay.
[221:36.08]Gently.
[221:36.56]Why?
[221:36.76]Is it going to break?
[221:37.98]Gently.
[221:40.34]Okay.
[221:41.94]And how do I split the potions in half to give you one?
[221:46.26]I'm just going to drink it.
[221:46.88]Can you right-click it a second time over your inventory or something?
[221:49.46]Or you hold right-click when you pick up something like that?
[221:53.23]It's just right-click.
[221:54.47]Okay.
[221:55.29]I have a potion here for you.
[221:59.89]Here it comes.
[222:02.81]Okay.
[222:03.61]Okay, Jerma.
[222:04.50]Did you get it?
[222:09.58]Drinking it.
[222:10.04]Are we doing this now?
[222:12.54]Should I press B and drink everything?
[222:14.98]We're doing this.
[222:15.64]Okay.
[222:16.02]Summon up your... Why am I on fire?
[222:19.30]Your things.
[222:20.20]Why am I on fire?
[222:21.68]Why am I burning?
[222:23.25]Why am I burning?
[222:24.87]Let's just get the fuck out of me.
[222:25.99]Okay.
[222:27.89]You ready?
[222:28.97]That was insane.
[222:30.11]Okay, I'm ready.
[222:33.18]I've got my sting summon.
[222:35.08]Kill that boy.
[222:35.66]What you have to do is throw the voodoo doll into the... Oh.
[222:38.20]There he goes!
[222:41.70]And then we just attack.
[222:43.06]Then we attack and walk backwards.
[222:49.61]Okay, start walking backwards.
[222:51.63]I'm dropping dynamite, so... Keep going.
[223:05.95]Oh, yeah.
[223:07.25]I said it wasn't long enough.
[223:08.94]I didn't think I was gonna actually... He's dead!
[223:12.24]Yeah.
[223:14.74]But last second, I was like, you know what?
[223:16.78]We went... We did so much.
[223:19.78]We needed, like, 35 feet.
[223:22.60]Yeah, we were a little overprepared.
[223:28.69]Wow, that's funny.
[223:33.60]we needed like a couple of hallways we made oh my fucking god dude are you serious that was like the last 40 minutes of this stream no I went to a lot of other things I built a lot of items
[223:56.11]We need it from here to here.
[223:57.93]And we have, like, this.
[224:01.55]Holy shit, you are not confident at all.
[224:03.43]That's so funny.
[224:07.29]That's what you call overkill.
[224:08.69]Yeah, hey, well, look, it's over.
[224:10.87]We win.
[224:11.75]You should have got a couple items, and everything that he drops is good.
[224:15.40]Okay, Wall of Flesh.
[224:21.47]Uh, prepare to face the terrors that lurk in the light and dark parts of this world.
[224:24.61]Place in your inventory to gain increased item grab range.
[224:28.31]Yeah, I trashed mine.
[224:33.17]Unfortunately for them, they were twisted by their inner demons until they were beyond saving.
[224:36.19]The Underworld.
[224:39.63]Wild Cleric Emblem.
[224:46.75]12% increased radiant damage.
[224:48.93]Healing spells will heal an additional one life.
[224:52.99]That's if you're a healer.
[224:53.78]Okay.
[224:54.10]Shadow Diamond.
[224:57.36]Arcane Summoner Emblem.
[225:00.94]Ooh.
[225:02.78]Now that's some good shit.
[225:04.30]15% increased summon damage and plus 20 mana.
[225:10.69]What do I replace?
[225:11.37]I don't even need Clown to Bottle anymore, do I?
[225:17.35]Because I can fly.
[225:17.89]Okay.
[225:20.94]What?
[225:22.04]I don't need cloud anymore?
[225:23.22]No, you probably don't need it, no.
[225:24.76]No, I'm just gonna put that on there.
[225:26.06]It's quite outdated.
[225:27.01]Oh, fuck, fuck.
[225:27.75]This is the tax collector.
[225:30.65]That's awesome.
[225:33.29]Oh, I don't have purification powder.
[225:36.05]Replace the bees?
[225:36.87]Oh, I like the defense on the bees still.
[225:39.60]It still seems pretty good.
[225:44.34]Um, you can start...
[225:46.95]showing the goblin your accessories so you can try and roll like plus four defense on every accessory you have oh that's cool so if there's one that like oh this one doesn't have the defense you can just try and roll it depending on what it costs cool is there a certain stat that a caster summoner should be looking for like plus one took more monsters or something uh defense is like the best one just defense look for defense every time yeah alright so the goblin is back at the town right yep
[226:17.31]Oh, that was cool.
[226:20.13]Um, so now there's a lot of things going on.
[226:22.40]I'm staying down here for, like, one second to get a couple of essences for a super OP weapon.
[226:31.32]And... This game is really fun.
[226:35.88]I'm, like, I, like, don't know what I'm doing still.
[226:37.88]Like, kind of learning a little.
[226:39.45]But, like, this is, like, really cool.
[226:43.07]There's, like, so many things.
[226:45.87]There are a lot of things.
[226:51.02]Alright, let's talk about the goblin you said, right?
[226:56.23]So you're talking about reforge?
[226:59.63]Yeah.
[227:01.21]Is this going to do it automatically or do I get to look at it?
[227:04.63]It's a random roll.
[227:06.05]Oh.
[227:07.63]And it's going to roll the thing that's green, right?
[227:10.74]Yeah.
[227:11.66]What does it cost?
[227:13.74]It'll tell you when you put the item in.
[227:15.06]Depends on item.
[227:17.52]Three gold, that's it?
[227:20.13]Yeah, the melee speed, that sucks on here.
[227:28.40]So I'm looking for anything else, really.
[227:29.72]Did it work?
[227:39.39]Am I missing something?
[227:47.50]I don't have enough gold.
[227:51.04]Right, okay.
[228:02.85]Come here, come here, come here.
[228:12.33]Hmm, 3% movement speed.
[228:16.25]A Shmelze.
[228:19.49]Why is the stacking burn?
[228:20.69]Okay.
[228:23.67]It's not bad.
[228:24.29]Harder than the wall to flesh, yeah.
[228:26.75]This one already has four defense.
[228:29.00]I feel like the 4% movement speed on this is dumb.
[228:32.74]Yeah.
[228:33.76]It's not enough.
[228:35.08]No.
[228:36.60]I mean, it's nice because movement speed is like not dying in Terraria, but you're really gonna have to stack it
[228:49.76]That fleeting cloud in the bottle is just trash.
[228:52.06]Now I can just sell it, right?
[228:55.10]Don't sell it.
[228:55.74]Don't sell it.
[228:56.38]Okay.
[228:57.56]We need to keep at least one or two.
[228:58.98]That's why I'm so afraid to sell anything.
[229:00.64]I feel like it might be needed later.
[229:02.36]I explained this a long time ago.
[229:03.62]Here's the rule.
[229:04.62]And that's why I'm saying it.
[229:07.06]Listen.
[229:08.52]When you look at an item, if on the item it says material, then you might need it.
[229:14.07]Right.
[229:14.45]If it doesn't say material and you don't need it, you'll never need it.
[229:20.10]everything says fucking material on it there's like one thing that doesn't angry okay angry ball and chain can I just sell that uh doesn't say material hold on a minute this is no this thing increases defense by eight it slows you I think that's pretty good I can fly oh
[229:56.07]Yeah, I think we needed this whole walkway.
[229:58.79]Huh?
[230:00.85]Yeah, this walkway could be longer, is all I'm saying.
[230:08.48]I need to get, like, two more Essences of Chaos.
[230:13.18]I'm gonna, I'm gonna make, like, I'm gonna be making a mistake here.
[230:15.82]Someone's gonna scream at me because they're gonna see that I'm, like, selling something I'm not supposed to be.
[230:19.78]Um...
[230:33.16]Honestly, I'm not afraid.
[230:34.46]Not after that last bite.
[230:37.45]None of these are materials, though.
[230:39.57]Oh, the guide is still dead.
[230:43.71]Mandible, bow, like this stuff sucked.
[230:45.68]Does it just sell it?
[230:46.26]Yeah, it does sell it.
[230:51.98]What about this ancient shiv?
[230:53.74]Not its material.
[230:58.60]Mandible claws like these things are dumb, right?
[231:01.96]Yeah.
[231:02.70]Yeah, you're getting it.
[231:03.60]You're getting a severed hands get rid of them Auto trash those sever hands.
[231:08.64]I told you sure nobody slicer get rid of them Who needs them nobody Alright, let's see how that gets me demonic carnage.
[231:18.33]What is this doing in here?
[231:19.17]63 melee damage
[231:24.98]Fast speed 15.
[231:26.12]What the fuck is in here?
[231:28.08]Oh, I was using that.
[231:29.02]I'm not using it anymore.
[231:30.68]What?
[231:36.70]It's pretty okay, but you need to build really high defense and melee stats.
[231:42.71]Otherwise, you're going to take so much damage trying to use that weapon.
[231:45.49]Does the harpoon do anything cool?
[231:46.69]It's immaterial.
[231:48.69]I don't think so.
[231:52.27]You can check with the guide, but I don't think it does.
[232:00.76]This only sells for 26 silver.
[232:09.60]Wait, what's going on?
[232:12.34]Why is everybody losing their mind?
[232:22.21]Oh, this is one of those stupid melee damage weapons that aren't melee.
[232:29.79]Alright, now let me try to reroll this again.
[232:35.36]Why does the price come down every time I do it?
[232:42.10]It was 3 gold last time, now it's 275.
[232:49.27]Ah!
[232:50.07]That's not good!
[232:50.63]2%- I went down!
[232:58.20]2% melee speed instead of 4%.
[232:59.82]Fuck.
[233:00.10]I only have 3 gold, yeah.
[233:20.18]Wait, I have more than that.
[233:22.30]I got way more gold than that!
[233:27.84]That one's really good.
[233:31.77]Okay.
[233:39.87]Get up here, turtle.
[233:49.42]Oh yeah, we need to go get you the crazy summon.
[233:51.96]The pig's not gonna get hit by the lava?
[234:03.64]Don't kill the pig.
[234:04.64]Alright, I just looked over at chat and I almost died.
[234:06.84]This pig was easy.
[234:08.54]That's because the air is blowing fast.
[234:12.21]The air is fast, dude.
[234:14.01]The wind is going nuts right now.
[234:20.83]One more.
[234:21.19]I feel like I'm in need of a new staff.
[234:30.89]There's an insanely good one that we can get you pretty soon.
[234:34.51]I like this one, but I need to do more damage.
[234:46.56]So one of the first things you do within hard mode is you have to fight basically the same boss as you fought before, but harder, that are mechanical bosses.
[234:53.49]So like the worm we fought is like the mechanical worm.
[234:57.29]I think it's them that drop hollowed bars, and the hollowed staff is actually really, really, really, really, really good.
[235:03.09]Really?
[235:05.71]Really.
[235:12.28]The wind is too strong.
[235:15.56]I can't get back in the house.
[235:18.70]Alright.
[235:19.88]Use your hook.
[235:21.50]Oh, right.
[235:24.11]Also, if you hook a closed door and open it, you go whoosh.
[235:29.59]Oh, come on.
[235:31.95]Alright.
[235:32.37]Alright.
[235:33.45]Got it.
[235:34.79]Plus three defense and plus 0.75% damage reduction.
[235:40.15]Nice.
[235:44.23]Oh, yeah.
[235:44.79]That's also the other thing you can get is damage reduction.
[235:49.11]So the extra movement speed on the quick lightning boots...
[235:54.74]Why even have that?
[235:55.47]Why not just roll something else?
[235:56.69]They're already quick.
[235:57.31]They're at 14 gold.
[235:58.25]Never mind.
[236:02.39]There's a good reason.
[236:03.27]That's a pretty good reason.
[236:13.08]Alright.
[236:14.22]I'm gonna put this other stuff in here.
[236:15.94]I've got, like, Wild Cleric Emblem.
[236:18.50]The Underworld.
[236:19.40]I'll keep the Wall of Flesh in the inventory, alright?
[236:22.48]Alright.
[236:25.04]Uh, if you want.
[236:26.70]If you care about that kind of bonus.
[236:28.44]I mean, it's kind of a good thing.
[236:36.23]Shadow diamonds?
[236:37.87]I'm just telling you what I picked up, because I want... Oh!
[236:41.49]Well, she told me about the shadow diamonds.
[236:45.59]No.
[236:46.45]Okay.
[236:47.23]No.
[236:48.68]Then never mind.
[236:50.58]Buy a piggy bank.
[236:51.00]You can put those in the storage, though.
[236:54.59]buy a piggy bank does it do you get like a return on investment do you get like a percentage increase piggy bank is kind of annoying to use but it's really good you put items inside of it and you can place it on the ground so it's like a second storage oh
[237:15.20]Oh, that's alright.
[237:16.02]So, like, if at any point you're like, ah, shit, my inventory's full, you place the, you can put shit in the piggy bank and, yeah.
[237:22.56]I don't like dealing with it myself, but it's worth it.
[237:25.73]Well, maybe eventually.
[237:33.17]Okay.
[237:34.69]I am ready.
[237:39.44]um I'm just trying to farm minions so I can get a thing if you go to the snow biome and you just start killing shit there's this one like flying around enemy um that you're gonna need to kill a couple of and that's what drops the summon and is the super good summon so you're telling me snow biome I don't have to go up uh press m and I look for snow yeah the snow up
[238:12.27]Or is that a cloud?
[238:17.30]That's a cloud.
[238:17.98]That's a cloud.
[238:18.76]Okay.
[238:19.18]I do see the snow.
[238:22.38]The snow is at the top of the corruption to the right.
[238:24.68]Yeah.
[238:25.20]So it's going to be a little annoying because it combines two enemies types.
[238:30.52]But yeah.
[238:31.54]Also, now that it's in hard mode, there's like the regular enemies will hurt you.
[238:35.73]So be careful.
[238:36.97]Alright.
[238:37.81]I will go kill the things down there.
[238:41.44]Also, collect snow blocks, because then you can make the upgrade to your boots.
[238:47.04]And leather, if you find any.
[238:49.28]Aye-aye.
[238:51.64]Aye-aye-aye.
[238:55.83]I just tried to double-tap D to run fast.
[238:59.43]DD.
[239:00.07]Like, didn't... But why, though?
[239:18.87]stop getting so close hello hello hello hello hello hey hello right oh yeah yeah right you think you're funny hello like hello let me drop maybe that guy took a lot of hits
[239:53.60]That's what I like about you.

[240:00.00]You're, like, not afraid.
[240:02.46]I've made it to the snow!
[240:03.69]Is this snow?
[240:08.41]This is, like, ice, right?
[240:09.69]This is ice.
[240:12.55]Yeah.
[240:15.83]Carnivore tail?
[240:16.75]Ooh, what's that?
[240:18.06]Can't look at it.
[240:19.28]That hurts a lot.
[240:32.99]Thank you.
[240:40.64]You weren't kidding when you said that they're much, much harder.
[240:43.55]No.
[240:44.67]Also, if you see something spawn in the air after you kill something that's like a crown and it doesn't move, like it's stuck in the air and doesn't drop to the floor, pick those up.
[240:56.34]Essences, like Essence of Sunlight, Essence of Ice, maybe.
[240:59.70]I don't remember what it's called.
[241:00.62]Do I have any light?
[241:02.86]Oh, that's not good.

[242:58.46]Which is really what you're in it for, you know?
[243:00.46]Yeah, that's true.

[245:18.93]I'm pretty sure.
[245:23.11]There's one right here.
[245:25.53]It didn't look like you dropped it.
[245:29.01]No, just a rotten chunk.
[245:30.07]I have no idea what the chance is, but... I've never, like, intentionally farmed them, but every time I've gotten that, I've been a very happy boy.
[245:37.32]Oh god, I'm gonna fucking die.

[246:05.75]Uh, I don't remember.
[246:07.47]Like, it might be a staff.
[246:09.01]I mean, you'll check it if you see a random thing drop.
[246:18.47]I didn't say hello to the soundboard.
[246:19.73]I will if it happens again.

[247:27.90]Icy shard.
[247:29.40]Icy shard.
[247:30.16]What does it all do?
[247:31.95]What's this?
[247:32.93]Glacial crystal.
[247:35.11]You can't pick up more than one of these?
[247:47.75]the monster spawns in the underground ice biome that this is not it here what I'm attacking now uh I know they spawn there but underground ice biome might be better which is probably underneath where you are so just go underneath okay yeah it is there should be some down there alright well hold on a minute here be careful
[248:27.87]I'm scared of this.
[248:28.55]Where's my rope?
[248:31.63]I don't know.
[248:37.90]I need the guide rope.
[248:38.78]I hate when the guide dies and then you get a whole new item.
[248:42.68]What does this do?
[248:43.14]And the guide's still dead because you went to hard mode and you're like, come on, guide.
[248:46.30]You know what I'm saying?
[248:51.39]Yeah.
[248:52.77]Yeah, whatever.
[248:55.17]Found him!
[248:56.53]No, that's not an ice corruptor.
[249:03.99]Yeah, remember these Evanstone blocks?
[249:06.25]Mm-hmm.
[249:06.91]I have them now.
[249:08.93]That's cool.
[249:11.19]Remember, like, two hours ago when you were looking for these?
[249:14.47]Got them now.
[249:14.97]Man, I had to go get something real quick.
[249:17.31]It's called an Ice Clasper.
[249:19.23]Okay.
[249:21.46]It is.
[249:22.02]He's correct.
[249:22.58]This is a factual statement just made.
[249:30.40]My fingers feel like wet cat food.
[249:35.95]What does it mean?
[249:36.33]It doesn't even feel like wet cat food.
[249:42.39]Are you alright?
[249:46.25]No.
[249:47.21]No, I'm not alright.
[249:55.36]Okay.
[249:56.46]Icy shard.
[250:00.86]We're just going down.
[250:04.81]I wish I brought bombs.
[250:12.33]Can I get a better pickaxe?
[250:13.53]I feel like it's been ages since I've got a new one.
[250:18.21]How do I stop biting my fingernails?
[250:19.49]Which one are you using?
[250:20.49]Just dip your fingers in vinegar.
[250:23.03]Come on.
[250:23.57]None of this water fucking count.
[250:25.01]Ugh.
[250:31.96]Ugh.
[250:36.74]Is the purple ice block cool?
[250:56.14]It's purple ice cool.
[250:58.26]I feel like I know what this tastes like.
[250:59.52]I want to like crunch into this purple ice.
[251:02.88]Is it going to have that, like, fruit, juicy, grape kind of taste?
[251:07.18]Ugh, I don't want to have that.
[251:10.86]Okay, bro.
[251:13.68]Come on, bro.
[251:22.19]More ice block.
[251:28.31]Maybe I should get some of this, too.
[251:38.45]Alright, well, there's frost worm.
[251:41.85]Did I drop anything?
[251:57.02]Did I upgrade my boots?
[251:57.98]Yes, I did.
[252:07.61]Yes, I did.
[252:17.33]I'm trying to figure out, like, the best... Should I just keep going down into the ice?
[252:22.36]Just keep going?
[252:23.04]I mean, this is clearly, like, we're getting down to, like, ice now.
[252:32.42]Oh, I'm muted.
[252:33.04]There's a lot of mobs that you kill in hard mode.
[252:36.37]that uh drop really good things so you're like not wasting time yeah I mean I've picked up at least really cool looking things have you gotten any essences um I have gotten like a I've got a dragon essence no I'm sorry dragon scale okay yeah that's useful for something but if you find like sunlight essence I think elam essence might be the the cold one I need those okay
[253:13.43]Also, very important, for the progression of Terrarium, for you to understand what's going on right now.
[253:19.56]Sure.
[253:21.70]When you get into hard mode, the first thing you should do, one of the first things,
[253:27.15]Actually, this is going to be annoying.
[253:30.08]You get the Poon Hammer, it's literally called Poon Hammer, from the Wall of Flesh.
[253:35.36]It's guaranteed drop.
[253:37.00]And the Demon Altars that are in the Corruption Zone, you smash them with the Poon Hammer, and then it adds new resources to the world.
[253:47.07]Because you Pooned them.
[253:48.77]Of course.
[253:49.15]Okay.
[253:53.64]okay I just want to make sure we're on the same page with like the poon hammer I I yeah I don't know who that was that could have been anybody yep snow come on need more snow maybe like find a cave or something also if you see lead surprisingly we still need it
[254:20.64]there's usually a planet that has it if you find a gravity potion actually I can buy one um you know I'm on operation lead I'm gonna take a brief detour from all the important freaking work I'm doing to get some lead what's the sun bad sinbad sunbat why is the sunbat down here good question
[254:50.99]Is he worth something?
[255:01.00]That is really good.
[255:04.06]Oh, angry dog!
[255:05.48]What?
[255:09.80]Fight the angry dog.
[255:11.02]Did he drop anything?
[255:16.61]Cursed flame.
[255:39.24]Still in the ice biome, so that's good.
[255:41.01]What are they still shooting at?
[255:45.17]Alright, you guys can stop now.
[255:48.95]Oh, wait, the sunbat.
[255:51.21]Thought he could sneak up on me.
[255:52.19]At least that's not gonna be good here.
[255:56.60]What's this?
[255:58.62]Essence of something!
[256:10.54]Okay, there's a big cave down here.
[256:12.10]This should be good.
[256:17.66]Pick it up?
[256:18.18]I didn't pick it up?
[256:22.76]I thought I... Oh, I thought I did pick it up.
[256:24.36]There was two then.
[256:26.18]Essence of Sunlight and... Did I... I didn't pick it up that first time when it popped up on the screen?
[256:35.21]Thank God you guys just said that, because I thought I had it... I thought it went in me.
[256:44.88]Alright, let's keep going.
[256:50.17]Amethyst.
[256:51.71]I'm running out of torches, though.
[256:53.11]Not good.
[257:09.25]No, when it popped up on the screen, I saw it.
[257:11.87]I mean, I said the name of the thing.
[257:14.79]I said, Essence of... And then I kept going.
[257:16.55]I thought I just picked it up.
[257:19.51]Okay.
[257:20.69]More people are making fun of me.
[257:21.61]That's fine.
[257:36.26]What's down here?
[257:36.92]Anything?
[257:39.07]Generation potion.
[257:40.01]Sick.
[257:47.22]Give me that staff.
[257:48.12]I want it!
[257:49.50]Let me do this.
[257:51.48]Let me have my fun.
[257:55.32]How many ice blocks do I have to absolute shitload?
[257:58.30]Alright, I'm gonna have to, like, come back.
[258:00.01]Kind of running out of materials and space.
[258:09.25]Go up here.
[258:24.29]Essence.
[258:28.21]Ice Slimer.
[258:31.15]Where am I?
[258:32.77]Oh, there it is!
[258:33.39]Ice Clasper.
[258:37.78]Did I get it?
[258:39.46]Essence of Ilium.
[258:42.92]Uh, yeah, that's it.
[258:47.08]Did I pick it up?
[258:54.05]What does it look like?
[258:57.09]There it is.
[258:57.85]Essence of Ilium.
[258:59.53]That's what I'm looking for?
[259:01.20]Yep.
[259:02.52]That's one of the things.
[259:03.20]Somebody said that's not what I'm actually looking for, though.
[259:06.84]It's a thing that you're looking for.
[259:08.16]Okay.
[259:09.70]It's part of the puzzle.
[259:10.48]It's part of the puzzle.
[259:13.28]There's another one.
[259:24.62]And... There's another one.
[259:30.01]So those things also drop a staff, and that's what I really want, right?
[259:33.12]I'm just gonna hang out here, then, if they spawned in here.
[259:35.98]Dude, you can, like, go get a drink and just let your summons kill them.
[259:39.40]They come near you.
[259:39.94]You know, just AFK farm this game.
[259:42.74]So we don't give a shit about the heart crystals anymore, right?
[259:54.04]Uh, we do for some reason.
[259:55.30]We do, okay.
[260:01.28]Jacob's here.
[260:19.01]I don't want to drown.
[260:22.05]That would be bad.
[260:27.00]That startled me because my name is Jacob.
[260:33.54]That's why I didn't die.
[260:38.89]Ancient ice chunk.
[260:40.83]Ah, what's that?
[260:42.99]Crafting material for something.
[260:46.09]This ice shouldn't break.
[260:48.31]Come on.
[260:56.65]Summons an ice clasper to fight for you.
[261:01.93]Are you kidding me?
[261:04.26]This is it.
[261:04.68]There it is.
[261:07.81]I got it.
[261:17.91]I'm excited now.
[261:18.85]Alright.
[261:19.25]So I have like a cool, powerful thing now.
[261:22.97]Oh, you just got it?
[261:23.95]I just got it.
[261:25.35]Wow.
[261:25.57]You did it.
[261:26.83]Well, yeah, now you, uh, now you win.
[261:28.71]I didn't know I wouldn't, you know, getting some upgrades.
[261:33.37]He's got a lot of big things down here, making some power plays, making some power moves.
[261:36.65]You know what I'm saying?
[261:37.50]There's something else over here.
[261:38.32]What's this?
[261:38.66]Topaz Crawler?
[261:44.84]Use it.
[261:45.36]Not yet.
[261:45.66]I don't want to use it yet.
[261:46.90]Alright.
[261:50.43]I think that's... I'm good, right?
[261:51.71]I can just get out?
[261:53.89]Dude, you are so good.
[261:56.07]Are you telling me I can have, like, seven of those?
[261:57.73]Six of those?
[262:00.48]However many you can have.
[262:01.78]Oh, wow.
[262:02.84]I'm not keeping track of your characters.
[262:05.86]Yeah, they're insane.
[262:07.36]It will stay good for a long time just because how actively they seek out targets.
[262:13.70]From 10 damage to 50.
[262:19.44]That's a huge difference.
[262:20.30]Because really, all my damage has been coming from the sphere staff thing.
[262:26.30]That's been doing all the damage.
[262:32.92]Um, stay there for one second.
[262:35.43]Stay here?
[262:36.37]I'm gonna teleport to you.
[262:37.21]Actually, there's something you can help me with.
[262:39.15]I have no torches, so hopefully you bring light.
[262:41.19]Uh, I have 2,000 torches.
[262:45.41]Would you like some?
[262:47.39]Eh, probably not.
[262:50.32]There's a chilled turtle down here.
[262:51.82]Uh, here.
[262:56.18]I'm dropping them.
[262:58.30]You ready?
[262:59.88]Um, hold on.
[263:00.62]There's like 500 torches right there.
[263:05.41]I think they fit perfectly in this hole.
[263:06.77]They did.
[263:07.11]I don't think I can even pick them up.
[263:11.45]I'm out of space.
[263:12.59]Glow stick.
[263:13.51]Um... Fuck.
[263:17.54]What do I have?
[263:18.08]What dumb thing do I have?
[263:20.26]I have some lead ore.
[263:21.98]Not very many.
[263:25.34]Is this lens?
[263:27.32]Do I have dirt?
[263:28.66]Oh, I do have dirt.
[263:29.40]You're right.
[263:30.40]Do I have dirt?
[263:33.91]Snow block.
[263:35.11]No.
[263:35.55]Alright.
[263:36.03]I gotta get out of here.
[263:41.47]I gotta get out of here.
[263:44.51]Use the heart?
[263:45.17]I can't.
[263:45.95]You need to come up here to me.
[263:47.27]You need to come up to the surface.
[263:48.54]There's a boss.
[263:53.82]That will probably kick our ass.
[263:56.68]Be gone, evil.
[264:00.88]You just killed it.
[264:03.60]uh no it's still gonna be on the surface you need to come up I'm coming up now I need to put my uh my new thing on there's gonna be ghosts don't die dude I don't even know what's going on down here I'm trying to get out what the fuck
[264:40.73]Dude, don't, don't get ghosted.
[264:42.65]I'm trying just to get the fuck out of the hole!
[264:44.43]Alright, I'm on the surface.
[265:05.45]Uh, is there an ice golem?
[265:06.81]Or is there a blizzard?
[265:07.71]Like, is it storming up?
[265:10.56]Uh, yes, it's very blizzard-y out here.
[265:12.82]Okay, walk left and right and try and see if you can find the icicle.
[265:15.58]Maybe it was underground, though.
[265:18.26]As I went up the one way.
[265:22.00]What?
[265:23.04]I'm fucking confused.
[265:24.02]Why is this not... Is this a summon?
[265:37.05]Alright, I got my shit.
[265:40.49]He's here.
[265:41.23]He's here.
[265:41.55]Hellfar showed up again.
[265:42.41]Okay, I'm coming up.
[265:44.15]He's somewhere.
[265:44.83]I don't know where exactly.
[265:46.87]Be careful because he's going to hurt.
[265:49.57]I don't know if we're ready for him.
[265:52.95]Oh, he's on me.
[265:53.93]On me.
[265:54.29]He's down this hole.
[265:56.78]Your things are attacking him.
[265:58.62]Good.
[265:59.76]He's almost dead.
[266:06.66]Because those summons are nuts.
[266:09.45]Melt him, melt him!
[266:10.80]And also he's in a hole.
[266:13.90]Wait, is it corrupt?
[266:14.94]Okay, keep going up.
[266:16.14]Climb out of the hole, climb out of the hole.
[266:17.66]Go to the surface.

[267:05.14]Mimic's drop.
[267:05.84]Where did he die?
[267:08.08]What the fuck?
[267:09.34]Why is there another one?
[267:10.90]Let's kill him.
[267:11.84]They just spawn in blizzards.
[267:16.66]He's over here underneath this house.
[267:23.47]Holy shit, they are destroying him.
[267:26.61]Yeah, those summons are ridiculous.
[267:28.31]What?
[267:34.67]Oh, my God.
[267:35.57]I can't pick up anything.
[267:36.71]I have no room.
[267:37.43]There's another one.
[267:37.99]There's another mimic.
[267:42.40]They just kind of wiggle towards you, and then they go up in the air and try and slam on top of you.
[267:46.44]So if you see it go up, just move a little bit to the left.
[267:51.00]You should be fine.
[267:52.56]I'm stuck.
[267:53.31]I'm stuck next to the house.
[267:54.23]Open the door.
[267:54.57]Dig out the right.
[267:55.13]Dig out the right.
[267:59.23]It's like a horror movie.

[269:06.41]Dude, I gotta like just... I got a ton of shit.
[269:08.91]I just gotta deposit and come back.

[269:17.27]Okay.
[269:19.42]I still need to destroy some altars with the poon hammer.
[269:23.96]Alright, I... And would appreciate all of your summons nearby.
[269:26.42]I... Let me make this staff.
[269:30.16]Right?
[269:30.36]Okay.
[269:30.56]Wait, this what?
[269:32.06]What are you making?
[269:33.68]Don't I... Can I make something?
[269:38.78]Can you?
[269:41.31]Yeah, I thought, like, I got, like, two different materials or something.
[269:46.65]I don't know what you got.
[269:51.01]Wasn't I looking for the essence?
[269:55.94]Uh, that can't make anything yet.
[269:57.60]No, okay.
[269:58.66]Where's the, uh, where's the dude?
[270:00.40]They just make a lot of things, and you need multiple.
[270:04.33]Where's, uh, did Jeffrey... The guide might be dead still.
[270:08.47]I think he's dead.
[270:11.37]Oh, no, no, he came back.
[270:12.33]He's all the way on the left.
[270:13.25]He's the second on the left.
[270:14.38]Oh, okay.
[270:22.49]I got something for you.
[270:23.53]I don't know what this is.
[270:24.83]Cosmic immaterializer.
[270:29.91]Oh, this is a different summon.
[270:33.37]Sun gods, this is like, this takes, there's nothing I can do with that right now.
[270:41.20]What the?
[270:42.20]Summons a cosmic energy spiral to fight for you.
[270:45.34]Does 4,439 damage.
[270:52.74]Wait, what?
[270:53.82]The thing that I can turn this staff into does 40, like, 500 damage.
[270:58.43]Oh, yeah, I mean, it'll take a long time to do that, though.
[271:01.07]But what about the essence?
[271:03.37]Let me see what that might go back.
[271:07.85]What can I do with that?
[271:18.25]Where is it?
[271:18.67]Right here.
[271:25.01]Did you pick up all the stuff that was there?
[271:27.19]I'm still getting it.
[271:28.99]Oh, dude, this sword is awesome.
[271:31.79]I'm so hyped.
[271:32.45]Starlight wings?
[271:33.44]Dude, everyone, get hype and chat.
[271:41.04]Reduces damage.
[271:43.12]Wings of the Nightingale.
[271:46.22]Horizontal speed.
[271:49.55]7.5.
[271:49.61]Acceleration multiplier.

[272:06.00]Prism... Prismaline?
[272:09.38]It's like a... It's like a knife.

[272:21.33]Dimensional Soul Artifact.
[272:24.27]Boosts all damage by 25%, but at what cost?
[272:28.50]Ooh, this is what we get.
[272:29.50]Cool.
[272:30.00]Arc of the Ancients.
[272:33.62]Uh, that's the super sword that I can pretty much make.
[272:37.22]Uh, yeah, you kinda can, can't you?
[272:40.83]Yeah.
[272:40.95]Yeah.
[272:42.28]it's it's ridiculous it it does melee damage but it makes stars shoot from the sky and missiles shoot from your weapon and just clutters the screen with nonsense but it's melee what about the arculus stuff how do you do that I mean the arculus sword the thing that you were like oh hold on to that um isn't that one of the components what are you talking about is that one of the components for this yeah yeah
[273:07.79]To make Ark of the Ancient.
[273:09.71]And Excalibur is really easy to get you.
[273:12.57]And then we have the other sword.
[273:14.87]We would just need the essences, which we have.
[273:17.31]We have three Elum and three Chaos already.
[273:22.47]What is this one?
[273:24.45]Slow moving ball of flash freezing magma.
[273:32.73]Nano round the Butcher.
[273:38.43]Alright, well... Let me just... Let's deposit this shit.
[273:46.12]Because I'm not gonna be- you're gonna be using that, not me.
[273:55.20]Silver ore, Evanstone block... This is still working really well.
[274:02.18]I don't think I'm even gonna have this on the bar anymore.
[274:07.38]I don't, yeah, I don't think I'm gonna be, I don't, let me see what that can turn into, though.
[274:15.45]What can I turn this into?
[274:16.63]Can I turn it into anything?
[274:19.99]No.
[274:21.83]I think it's time to sell this.
[274:30.42]Man, how long were you out there looking for the ice class?
[274:33.16]I, like, in that mess of bullshit we fought, I got one.
[274:38.13]Not that long.
[274:39.81]This thing's cool, but it's time to sell it.
[274:44.27]It's going away.
[274:45.32]Say goodbye.
[274:53.24]This is just too good.
[274:55.70]Alright, now those... I can make the boots, right?
[274:59.48]Ice skates.
[275:02.24]Ice skates.
[275:04.03]What does it take?
[275:04.69]You need leather.
[275:06.65]I think there's some in there.
[275:07.77]There's seven leathers.
[275:08.89]Show the crafting guy the leather.
[275:10.81]The boots will be on there.
[275:12.25]And then see what else you need.
[275:13.39]I don't think there's enough leather, and I don't... I don't even know what drops that.
[275:17.20]You just kind of get it.
[275:18.22]Okay, I'm looking for the ice skates.
[275:23.94]Ice skates require 20 ice blocks, 5 leather, and 5 any iron bar.
[275:27.76]Any iron bar.
[275:35.92]We don't have iron bars, do we?
[275:38.76]Lead is the same thing.
[275:40.81]It is.
[275:41.43]Do we have any lead bars?
[275:43.67]A few.
[275:45.15]Maybe five.
[275:45.77]What's the best place to find any iron bar?
[275:51.35]Iron or lead?
[275:52.34]What's the best place to find it?
[275:54.72]Underground.
[275:55.68]Not too deep.
[275:56.46]Just somewhere.
[275:57.26]There's honestly going to be a lot of it.
[275:58.58]We just kind of ignored it.
[276:20.95]Let's find it.
[276:23.77]Desert fossil?
[276:24.63]You need a desert fossil for anything?
[276:28.87]Oh, hold on.
[276:34.35]First of all... Okay.
[276:45.66]Unholy arrow.
[276:46.70]I'm just looking for... Alright.
[276:55.86]Oh, you gave me 5,000 torches and I put them all in the trash.
[277:01.44]And by trash, I mean the deposit.
[277:08.61]What the hell is making that noise?
[277:14.09]Is that lead right here?
[277:16.83]Hardened sandstone.
[277:22.54]There we go, lead.
[277:52.70]Tin?
[277:53.56]Tin doesn't count as iron, right?
[277:58.26]I don't think so.
[278:11.81]Lead right here.
[278:20.40]I think I have enough.
[278:23.55]Lead... How much lead ore makes a bar, too?
[278:25.43]Something like that?
[278:39.53]Three, okay.
[278:51.11]I should have enough after this.
[278:53.71]Some more right here.
[278:54.37]Hey, hey, dream up!
[278:57.05]Hey, what's up?
[278:59.83]I got a, uh, Blazing Heart for you.
[279:02.97]Ooh!
[279:03.69]That's not, that's not, like, emotional.
[279:07.40]That's, like, I actually have it.
[279:10.38]Do you now?
[279:13.28]Well, I appreciate it.
[279:14.46]3, 6, 9, 12, 15, I need 5.
[279:15.48]Is this lead ore in the box, right?
[279:21.49]Like three or four?
[279:22.25]I need five, right?
[279:24.33]I think I just put some in, actually.
[279:25.85]Yeah.
[279:35.96]Here is the Blazing Heart.
[279:40.06]You can also craft Blazing Hearts to get your health to 400, but you need Hellstone.
[279:44.32]So if you spend the time to do it.
[279:47.56]Mm-hmm.
[279:48.84]Alright.
[279:50.36]I'm going to make those boots.
[279:57.06]Lead bar.
[280:01.07]I'm going to go try and kill a harpy, I think.
[280:03.71]Do you say that there's lead ore in here?
[280:06.39]I think so.
[280:07.83]Yes, there is.
[280:12.29]Oh, wait.
[280:12.59]I was crafting the freaking dummy thing.
[280:14.77]Okay.
[280:18.90]so easy to forget what you're doing in Terraria yeah it is especially at a point in a game like this where you're instantly thrown this many new items yeah it's really overwhelming but it's a lot of fun alright so I have I have everything I need ice skates I pass them
[280:49.74]Oh, I have to do it over here.
[280:53.41]Where's the loon?
[280:59.41]Where's the loo?
[281:01.78]Oh, it has to be in your inventory.
[281:03.06]Yep.
[281:18.10]What am I missing in my inventory?
[281:19.70]Ice, lead, leather, and then, like, what am I missing?
[281:35.29]What the fuck am I missing?
[281:43.98]What are you trying to do?
[281:44.76]You might be at the wrong crafting station.
[281:46.68]Ice gates?
[281:47.29]Ice gates.
[281:49.31]You have to stand near this thing over here.
[281:51.97]The ice creator.
[281:54.77]Oh, there's an ice creator.
[281:56.77]Okay.
[281:57.31]Yeah, I got annoyed at the same thing.
[281:59.53]Alright, so I got the ice gates, and now I'm going to make the super duper super boots.
[282:09.54]Okay, chat, like...
[282:11.93]What the fuck was I doing with the purified shards?
[282:13.97]Do I have to go to a different table for this one too?
[282:22.64]Is there another table?
[282:23.64]I have to take the boots off.
[282:26.24]Okay.
[282:41.82]Am I losing my mind right now?
[282:48.09]The tinker table.
[282:54.56]Which one of these is the tinker table?
[283:01.57]Tinker table on the left.
[283:08.85]far right tinker table on the left on the far right okay there it is oh I keep muting you can have here try this accessory I don't know if you're gonna actually use it but here
[283:35.74]Let's just look at these.
[283:36.62]Allows flight, super fast running, extra mobility on ice, 7% degrees of movement speed.
[283:42.16]So this is just, we just keep going.
[283:45.77]So, is super fast faster than incredibly fast?
[283:51.27]One can only assume.
[283:52.85]I mean, that would sound pretty good.
[283:58.15]Okay, now what can I do with this?
[284:03.87]I can do more than this?
[284:07.80]No, no, it's just it.
[284:09.58]It's not.
[284:10.28]It's not.
[284:11.26]You can't.
[284:11.66]This is the end.
[284:13.64]Oh my god.
[284:14.46]Fa... Angel treads.
[284:22.96]Extreme speed.
[284:25.68]Water and lava walking and temporary immunity to lava.
[284:31.44]Enhanced ability to walk on water, ice, fireblocks, and lava allows flight as the wearer can run incredibly fast.
[284:39.98]These seem, like, better, right?
[284:42.24]That's a lot of bars.
[284:47.43]But, whatever.
[284:48.07]I mean, let's... How fast is fast?
[284:51.37]Super fast.
[284:57.27]Let's just run.
[285:04.09]I mean, that's... That's pretty fast.
[285:15.69]Can I fly for longer, too?
[285:17.57]Not really.
[285:20.15]Hey, want to assist me?
[285:22.31]Yeah, I was just looking at the thing I just made.
[285:25.20]Yeah.
[285:27.90]Okay.
[285:28.92]You gave me something.
[285:29.50]Did you check the accessory I gave you, Fearmonger?
[285:31.30]5% reduced damage taken.
[285:34.32]Enemies are less likely to target you.
[285:38.36]Um... It's not that good, but... No, what can I turn it into?
[285:45.29]You combine it with some healer item I don't know how to get, and then it reduces damage to allies around you.
[285:53.70]Oh, that's cool.
[285:58.54]5% reduced damage taken versus 4 defense and 1% damage reduction.
[286:07.54]what turns out to be more damage mitigation you know what I'm saying five percent less damage or one percent less damage and four defense anybody know probably five percent five percent if I had to guess well we'll get it on there then no more bees what can I do with the bees
[286:35.56]Honey balloon?
[286:36.90]That's cool.
[286:44.40]Alright, alright.
[286:45.06]Assist.
[286:46.57]Plague hive.
[286:47.41]I mean, it's... There's a lot of stuff.
[286:49.83]This is what I was saying.
[286:50.95]Like, this is... This is like going to the bakery.
[286:55.50]and the chocolate factory at the same time, and they just say, hey, by the way, Jeremy, everything is free today.
[287:02.28]But you can only have 10 things.
[287:05.56]You can have anything you want, but you can only pick 10.
[287:10.01]It's more like you can have whatever, but you need to learn and understand what all the ingredients are first.
[287:16.19]No.
[287:18.93]As long as you can prove to us that you know the recipe, we'll give it to you for free.
[287:29.09]Shit, I mean, that looks really good, but how do they possibly get all the pastry in there?
[287:33.40]How do you get the chocolate sprinkles on there to stick?
[287:36.86]Sorry, motherfucker.
[287:40.10]No, but I know how to make the meringue.
[287:42.90]It's eggs and lemon and then... Okay, what else?
[287:50.37]A wormhole to me.
[287:52.69]We're about to get fucking crazy.
[287:54.59]What?
[287:55.77]Hold on, I don't have anything.
[287:58.86]Do I have... Let me deposit my... Hold on.
[288:01.40]You need me now.
[288:03.26]Wait.
[288:03.66]Hold on.
[288:04.12]I don't... Wait.
[288:04.72]Hold on.
[288:06.02]Like, seriously.
[288:07.16]Do you want to fight a boss or no?
[288:08.78]I do, but there are too many fucking ingredients on the table.
[288:12.35]I mean, you're going to have more after this boss.
[288:14.25]Oh, my God.
[288:15.15]Okay.
[288:15.83]I guess I'm coming to you.
[288:18.91]Quick.
[288:19.35]Before this blizzard ends.
[288:20.21]I don't even know where the fuck you are.
[288:22.79]Wormhole potion.
[288:24.11]I don't... But I'm on the map right now, and I don't even see you.
[288:26.71]To the right.
[288:27.56]Oh, this...
[288:34.11]Wormhole potion.
[288:35.51]I'm here.
[288:40.37]You have all your stuff summoned?
[288:41.85]I've got all my stuff.
[288:46.72]Is this going to be hard?
[288:48.40]I don't know.
[288:48.84]Dude, I don't know.
[288:52.04]There he is.
[289:01.96]Honestly, it's hard to gauge because I fought a lot of these things a little bit late the last time I played.
[289:06.77]So I was already too strong.
[289:08.85]But also you have seven ice claspers or whatever you have.
[289:15.09]Also, I have one.
[289:16.21]It's just... It's just... It's murder, dude.
[289:21.20]We're going to do another one.
[289:31.20]And might have done too.
[289:32.08]I don't know if the second one's blocked.
[289:42.36]Oh no, I tried the strategy and it didn't work because I'm stupid.
[289:54.11]I might fucking die like a dumbass.
[289:55.83]He dropped a lot of health.
[289:56.73]Go pick it up.
[289:57.30]Go pick him up.
[290:07.94]I'm gonna be real with you.
[290:09.53]I, like, just can't even tell if there's anything on the screen.
[290:13.65]Like, everything is so, it's so dark and everything's... Yeah, the blizzard is rough.
[290:16.93]You're, you're dying, man.
[290:18.03]You have healing potions?
[290:19.07]Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
[290:26.58]The one that, the thing that mine dropped was pretty shitty.
[290:28.78]I don't know what you got.
[290:32.48]Ice golem.
[290:33.16]Another ice golem.
[290:41.73]also actually for a summon boy um if you go up in the sky you can fight the wind elemental and then you get an accessory item that just like really where you constantly have a wind elemental that follows you what do you drop anything good uh I think you dropped a lot of it down the hole and not really
[291:16.12]Still kind of hanging out, waiting for another one to spawn.
[291:29.04]Ooh, he dropped an essence.
[291:31.13]He dropped a frost barner?
[291:33.73]Frost Barney?
[291:37.83]Frost barrier.
[291:40.27]Ooh, nice.
[291:42.31]Lucky shackle.
[291:43.71]Oh god.
[291:55.01]I don't even know where my summons are.
[291:55.91]They're just running around aimlessly.
[292:08.46]I'm trying to summon another boss and it's not happening.
[292:14.10]Amarok?
[292:19.85]Oh, there we go.
[292:20.49]Oh, here he is.
[292:32.25]This music is so loud.
[292:33.27]Is it just me?
[292:34.97]It's like louder music than every other boss.
[292:39.29]My music's turned down.
[292:46.45]What's that?
[292:47.81]Dangerous glacier.
[292:49.04]It's not very good.
[292:51.04]Yeah, I don't know what this boss's drop pool is, but I'm not impressed.
[293:01.51]I gotta stand still.
[293:02.25]I gotta regen.
[293:12.84]I wanna make sure they're all still alive.
[293:16.22]How many fucking torches did you put on this house?
[293:18.90]What?
[293:19.60]What are you talking about?
[293:22.42]I don't know.
[293:23.10]Nothing.
[293:23.46]Where?
[293:23.72]I don't know where.
[293:25.44]Show me.
[293:27.10]The house over to the right though.
[293:28.34]Like random generated house.
[293:33.21]uh I don't know what there's a torch on every tile in front of it like no space between them I don't know sometimes I get scared man pirates are approaching from the west go back to the base and tell me when you're there because I need to wormhole on you here I'm at the base okay they'll be here soon
[294:01.33]They're kind of annoying.
[294:02.51]There's no door.
[294:02.95]It's just like every other invasion.
[294:04.27]Pirate captains kind of hurt.
[294:06.71]They drop a absolute shit ton of gold.
[294:10.61]Really?
[294:11.49]So we want to be here to kill them.
[294:19.29]Alright, this, I'm just going to have to deposit it.
[294:21.83]I will have to look at it later.
[294:23.79]I'm going to have to look at it later.
[294:24.91]It's all in there.
[294:25.53]I don't know.
[294:27.73]I'll check it out later.
[294:41.65]the pirates have arrived honestly you're probably gonna auto kill a lot of them especially if they walk this way because I have like the lava ground and they don't they don't give a shit about lava yeah they really don't just put this on here
[295:17.46]We're both on the other side.
[295:21.24]If you stay on this side, then they probably won't spawn on the other side.
[295:24.62]They're coming in here.
[295:25.52]This door is open.
[295:26.02]If we shut the door, they shouldn't be able to get in that door.
[295:30.63]Nothing despawns in Terraria, right?
[295:32.89]It just stays there and takes money.
[295:34.03]Or should we go collect it from time to time?
[295:37.43]I actually don't know.
[295:38.21]I think it's a lot different between multiplayer and single player.
[295:57.59]Oh, I got something.
[296:16.60]There are more than 4,000 items on the ground, it starts to despawn.
[296:25.60]Well, now there's 3,415.
[296:26.60]That's a lot of stuff.
[296:46.10]There's like a... Oh my god, there's so much stuff.
[296:49.66]Yeah, they drop like golden toilets and stuff.
[296:53.06]As well.
[296:53.46]You're going to want to sell that.
[297:00.31]We might have to destroy a pirate ship.
[297:02.86]I'm surprised we haven't seen it yet.
[297:13.63]That would be the pirate... Whoa!
[297:16.99]What?
[297:18.25]It just crashed into the side.
[297:22.85]Here we come!
[297:26.03]Somebody's just like... Somebody didn't know how to break.
[297:36.50]Full speed ahead.

[314:56.13]Did you use all the... I gave you, like, 500.
[314:58.83]Well, you did, but... See, what's been happening is I've deposited all, and I'm not clicking them, and I deposit them all back in.
[315:07.07]Okay, because you just deposit all.
[315:09.13]That's all you do.
[315:10.71]That's all you ever do.
[315:11.91]No, no, no, that's not true.
[315:13.93]I do look at a lot of things.
[315:15.65]I do go over lots of things, but... If you come to me, I have 1,400 in hand, luckily.
[315:22.17]Well, that's good.

[316:30.48]Alright, what do you... Do you want to find something specific?
[316:35.42]You keep on going, uh, well, uh, and then you don't tell me.
[316:39.90]What are you doing?
[316:41.86]I forgot what I was doing.
[316:42.64]We're doing a psychotic amulet.
[316:54.28]Glow sticks are amazing.
[316:55.14]They work in water.
[316:56.30]Nice.
[316:59.58]Nice.

[317:03.92]Oh, what's this?
[317:09.33]I can't get this.
[317:10.25]I can't get this.
[317:10.81]This is too good of a material.
[317:11.87]What is this?
[317:14.70]That's why we're on this mission.
[317:15.96]We need to find... I added the new resources to the world, but we can't mine them yet.
[317:21.42]So we need to find the granite area.
[317:26.25]Because there are... There's a way to get a pickaxe from that.
[317:32.67]Wait a minute.
[317:33.11]Hold on.
[317:33.47]Purple.
[317:36.37]Oh, shit.

[317:43.54]I can't fucking mind this either.
[317:47.20]Oh, there's something over here too.
[317:50.84]Uh, where?
[317:51.40]Is it in here?
[317:53.94]I just saw like a- where's the heart?
[317:56.68]Right, there it is.
[318:08.47]Life crystal.
[318:17.07]So, we're trying to find the material to be able to get new axes to be able to mine the shit that's down here.
[318:39.61]Use heart.
[318:42.77]What?

[320:16.57]Yes, I am.
[320:19.73]Hey!
[320:21.07]To your left and that's a boss that spawned in it.
[320:25.05]It should be really weak for how strong we are right now.
[320:36.95]Is this a boss?
[320:37.63]Do you listen to me?
[320:42.53]I said, no, I was saying, this is a boss?
[320:44.79]Like, as in, it's not, shouldn't be.
[320:46.95]It's like a standard enemy.
[320:47.89]Not, hey, is this a boss?
[320:50.03]It's from before hard mode.
[320:53.34]I was mocking it.
[320:54.94]Like, this is a boss?
[320:56.94]No, you're covering for yourself.
[320:59.46]I appreciate that you'd go to those lengths for me.
[321:01.46]Listen to that clip and you'll hear that it was like, this is a boss?
[321:09.83]Granite block.
[321:10.95]Yeah.
[321:13.87]This is a block?
[321:15.69]I'm not hearing anything.
[321:16.67]Energy core.
[321:20.45]Wound stone.
[321:22.94]There's a guy down here.
[321:24.26]There he is, Mr. Wizard.
[321:27.52]Oh, he found him.
[321:29.36]Where'd he go?
[321:32.20]Thanks for saving me, friend.
[321:33.04]This bondage was starting to chafe.
[321:37.56]Crystal ball.
[321:40.27]ice rod ooh oh here take your stupid ice mirror 29 damage someone's a block of ice this any good uh I think his stuff is dated I'm not sure crystal ball functions as a demon altar this is a bar thing oh dude crystal ball that's actually I'm getting one uh do you have 10 gold on you
[322:09.88]I have three.
[322:12.74]Ah!
[322:14.06]That's better.
[322:15.78]Aren't you going to, like, trap this guy somewhere?
[322:20.04]Yeah, he auto-moves into one of the trap houses.
[322:24.94]He auto... Hold on a minute.
[322:27.15]He auto-moves in to one of the trap houses.
[322:30.27]Yeah, yeah.
[322:32.87]How do you move into a house that traps you?
[322:36.17]Most of Wrath is about this exact situation.
[322:40.05]here we take silver bars in here oh sick we found a way to summon one of the skeleton mechanical balls so we can do that and then you can use hollow bars to make a pickaxe right chat right or does hollow bars not have a pickaxe anybody know
[323:10.24]yes correct yes everyone's saying yes okay you also need the boss souls so yeah we're gonna have to do all the mechanical bosses then which is a pain but that's one down
[323:32.39]uh because in in in the granite area I'm trying to remember you some like no enemies are spawning and this place sucks um one of the golems drops the like geode clump or something and the geodes allow you to make a pickaxe but there's there's no enemies here
[323:58.80]and I'm kind of pissed if I had a six if I had a clone if I had a tiny clone of star would I torture it he wouldn't he does what you mean like a like a doll like a voodoo doll or something
[324:26.86]Um, no.
[324:29.64]No, I wouldn't.
[324:33.85]I'm just gonna keep going this way.
[324:42.14]Giraffit in the lava.
[324:53.55]No, I'm not gonna use like a voodoo doll on somebody.
[325:00.43]If anything, I would like have a voodoo doll of somebody and like cook bacon around it.
[325:07.13]So they'd be like, what's that bacon smell?
[325:15.26]I would put like money on its hands and shit.
[325:25.62]I would light incense and have, like, aromatherapy around it so you just, like, felt better.
[325:32.60]That's not how it works.
[325:33.70]I know it's not how it works.
[325:35.58]Alright, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma,

[326:20.12]Feels like to upgrade to your next pickaxe, the things you need to do are so specific.
[326:26.32]Too hard?
[326:28.81]Like, I... Meowthrower?
[326:31.37]I kind of want to play with the Meowthrower.
[326:38.08]Might be fun.
[326:48.55]Let me see.

[326:52.49]I got the good boots.
[326:53.33]I have the fearmonger.
[326:54.73]5% damage reduction.
[326:57.97]Yeah, that's good.
[326:59.63]That's good.
[327:00.19]These are all really good.
[327:01.49]It's going to take a lot for me to replace this.
[327:06.52]What about armor?
[327:09.54]I feel like I need new armor soon.
[327:18.62]The Psycho Amulet.
[327:24.79]Boosts rogue and ranged damage and critical strike chance by 5%.
[327:27.95]Grants a massive boost to these stats if you aren't moving.
[327:31.97]Does that count for my summons?
[327:41.60]It does not.
[327:44.25]well what about you star what about me do you want the psychotic amulet what does it do boosts rogue and range damage and crit strike by five percent oh yeah I do grants a massive boost to these if you stand still if you are not moving yeah I do okay here you go
[328:14.26]Yeah, I do.
[328:15.34]What does massive mean, then?
[328:18.86]How much more than massive?
[328:20.08]I'm a massive man.
[328:21.50]Oh, I did?
[328:21.90]Oops.
[328:25.65]Oh, yeah!
[328:26.71]Fuck, dude!
[328:27.73]You're right.
[328:29.13]Huh?
[328:30.89]I'm right?
[328:31.29]What did I do?
[328:33.67]No, chat guy was right.
[328:36.15]He knew exactly the thing I needed.
[328:37.77]He knew just how to talk to me.
[328:39.29]He laid me just right.
[328:41.68]You cut out like three times, but I'm glad.
[328:44.32]Congratulations.
[328:44.92]I'm glad you're happy.
[328:46.40]I'm very happy.
[328:47.98]I just think we might have to kill the slime god again.
[328:50.08]Okay.
[328:53.67]Does somebody sell better healing potions than lesser healing potions?
[328:59.53]Or do you have to deal with... I just put some potions in the storage, but... No, potion guy doesn't.
[329:06.01]Material?
[329:06.87]Can you just craft them?
[329:10.07]Hold on.
[329:10.61]How do you craft them?
[329:16.66]Okay, healing potion.
[329:17.56]So I need glowing mushroom and a lesser healing potion.
[329:22.10]It's a huge pain in the ass.
[329:23.92]Is it a pain in the ass to get these?
[329:26.95]Yeah.
[329:27.81]Yeah.
[329:31.78]We also don't know where our mushroom biome is, so you're gonna have to find that.
[329:35.40]Huh.
[329:39.78]Uh, I need your help to kill Slime Boy.
[329:41.66]Need my help to kill Slime Boy?
[329:44.24]Then things are gonna get a-rollin'.
[329:45.40]Okay.
[329:50.55]Did you say you want cobwebs?
[329:53.13]I don't care about them anymore.
[329:54.31]Oh.
[329:55.37]Sorry, like, three hours later, Slime God has awoken!
[330:17.12]Did you give me that throwing thing that you mentioned?
[330:19.00]Throwing thing?
[330:21.38]Yeah, you said throwing damage.
[330:24.65]You had a thing.
[330:25.73]I said, yeah, I wanted it.
[330:26.85]And I don't think you ever gave it to me.
[330:29.29]Like two minutes ago.
[330:31.07]Yeah, the thing that we were just talking about, the damage thing.
[330:35.20]Yeah.
[330:35.62]Yeah, I gave it to you.
[330:38.36]Did you re-pick it up?
[330:40.66]Nope.
[330:46.07]Ooh, I have it.
[330:46.83]Where is it?
[330:48.67]Uh, give me the purified gel that he dropped.
[330:52.96]Purified gel.
[330:53.72]Are you gonna, I mean, are you gonna say please for this?

[331:02.76]Here, take this too.
[331:04.23]And take that too.
[331:05.75]And I guess you can have, you can have that too.
[331:09.87]I don't care.
[331:11.21]You already have one of those?

[331:59.92]It's nighttime, so we're going to fight one of the next bosses, and I'm going to look up how to make the others really fast.
[332:04.28]Alright.
[332:06.50]Okay.
[332:07.74]Let me get some of those potions out here.

[332:15.78]Um... Pretty strong right now.
[332:20.74]Oh, shit.
[332:24.01]Non-granite pickaxe isn't good enough.
[332:31.99]Where's the fucking bacon, bro?
[332:34.41]Alright.
[332:46.57]Oh, did you just throw this back to me?

[333:20.69]Are we fighting it right here?
[333:22.25]Where did I put it?
[333:25.75]Skeleton Prime.
[333:27.23]Whoa!
[333:27.69]There it goes.
[333:28.13]What the fuck is hitting me?
[334:04.25]He's got a lot of health.
[334:14.24]Yeah.
[334:18.77]Where you going?
[334:32.22]He's kind of a mean guy.
[334:34.66]He is kind of a mean guy.
[334:36.61]Like, we're the only reason he exists.
[334:39.75]You know?
[334:40.89]Yeah, I didn't even drink my potions.
[334:42.01]I don't think I'm going to, though.
[334:45.51]Why?
[334:45.71]Because he's chasing me?
[334:46.55]No, because I'm not in too much danger.
[335:13.56]skeleton prime oh now we're chunking them uh some oh summon your things again your sentries I got him
[335:32.35]Oh, are they all in the same spot?
[335:34.97]I spawn them when he moves a little bit.
[335:48.34]Hmm, where's he going?
[335:57.18]What are you doing?
[335:58.12]He's kind of just running back and forth here.
[336:00.78]Yeah, his arms are all gone.
[336:02.30]Ooh, that hurt.
[336:10.58]So is there a skeleton, like a super skeleton prime?
[336:14.89]Uh, it's the skeleton twin eyes.
[336:17.99]This guy and mechanical worm.
[336:21.25]And then, after you beat all of those, you can fight Plantera.
[336:27.62]Sounds cheeky.
[336:33.04]Get some better mana potions.
[336:34.22]Yeah, these ones kind of suck, huh?
[336:36.94]They feel like only two or three globes.
[336:50.33]I don't mind you just picking up my gel knives that are everywhere.
[336:54.37]Sorry, Mom.
[336:56.25]Armor pen?
[336:57.13]Do you need armor pen?
[337:00.75]Uh, we both get that.
[337:02.37]Well, we both get this.
[337:04.97]Yep.
[337:05.55]Those are guaranteed.
[337:06.57]First time you kill a boss.
[337:10.44]So what about the mechanical bosses?
[337:12.44]Is this just lore stuff?
[337:14.98]What?
[337:15.76]The other one?
[337:19.09]What?
[337:19.45]The other item that he drops.
[337:22.18]Once useful tools turned into savage beasts when their AIs went rogue, a mistake that Drayden failed to rectify in time.
[337:27.96]I see that you have awakened Drayden's old toys.
[337:29.60]That is mod added lore.
[337:31.90]Okay.
[337:32.24]It's the most pointless thing you could be reading.
[337:34.64]I didn't know if it was like a material or something.
[337:37.54]Or like a boss thing.
[337:42.30]Lore.
[337:49.42]I think I deposited my other one of these.
[337:53.98]Ah shit, we need souls of night.
[337:55.47]You don't have those by chance, do you?
[337:57.65]Souls of night, hold on.
[337:59.71]I actually deposited... What was that thing called?
[338:04.77]I did it again.
[338:05.68]Fucking god damn it.
[338:06.60]I was just trying to go over here.
[338:14.18]What the hell is this thing called again?
[338:19.29]Sort by name?
[338:20.99]Sort by ID?
[338:22.88]What are those boss soul things called?
[338:25.92]What?
[338:27.74]Soul of Fright is what he dropped.
[338:29.26]That's not what we need.
[338:44.55]There we go.
[338:47.99]No?
[338:48.39]There it is.
[338:51.45]Either way, we need a Mithril Anvil.
[338:53.25]Oh, this part's annoying.
[339:05.40]Didn't I have another one that was more item range?
[339:07.30]I forget what it was called.
[339:10.04]Thanks, PlentyDucks.
[339:14.32]My foot hurts a lot.
[339:20.43]Sorry to hear that.
[339:28.62]Ayaya.
[339:32.52]Oh wait, I have the pickaxe!
[339:34.96]Shake it out a little.
[339:39.04]Ooh, there's a goodie bag in here!
[339:46.96]Vampire shirt.
[339:48.16]Vampire mask.
[339:49.18]Vampire pants.
[340:14.21]why is everybody freaking out in here everyone's like what what's going on what nothing's going on no no something like something major is going on what are you talking about something what
[340:34.30]Something what?
[340:35.83]Somebody was streaming porn.
[340:36.69]That's what you sound like.
[340:37.57]Something what?
[340:39.31]That's what you sound like right now, dude.
[340:40.83]Apparently somebody was like in the top of just chatting, streaming porn.
[340:47.63]Oh, actually someone was saying that in my chat.
[340:51.87]Nice.
[340:54.25]How many people?
[340:54.91]It had 20,000 viewers.
[340:58.15]Why did it take an hour to put that down?
[341:02.77]What?
[341:04.81]I don't know.
[341:05.45]It's late on the West Coast, I guess.
[341:08.01]It's not that late.
[341:10.27]It's like not even 10 o'clock.
[341:12.59]I mean, it's not like... I don't know if they have like 24-hour moderators on every single channel just to make sure someone doesn't do something wrong.
[341:20.06]No, but did you hear how many people were there?
[341:21.94]Yeah, but they're historically very slow at these things and very inconsistent in their moderation.
[341:29.84]So I'm not surprised.
[341:33.72]I guess that's what I'm getting at.
[341:34.66]It's like, yeah, that sucks, but I'm not surprised.
[341:36.74]It's just kind of bizarre.
[341:43.13]We need to make sure it's really porn.
[341:44.89]Is this something we want?
[341:48.67]I gotta check with my supervisor.
[341:51.43]Are we doing porn now?
[341:58.94]20,000 people live.
[342:00.06]That's fucking insane.
[342:02.81]Alright, so what's next?
[342:05.25]By the way, what's your time frame here?
[342:08.31]How you doing?
[342:09.59]I don't want to go much longer.
[342:10.87]I've been a good sleep schedule boy.
[342:12.77]Yes.
[342:13.30]So it is midnight for you?
[342:19.60]I'd like to go a little bit longer just so I can get this pickaxe thing out of the way.
[342:23.20]Yeah.
[342:24.58]So that the path is clear when we next start.
[342:28.28]So what I'm doing is I got
[342:31.11]a gel pickaxe so that I can mine one of the new ores and get you a pickaxe and then we can mine the other ores and have a good old mine fest mine now I can get palladium then I can make a palladium pickaxe and then we can start making a mithril anvil and that kind of stuff actually maybe now is like a decent spot to stop is it yeah it's kind of like the uh
[342:58.34]the true start to uh the hard mode okay because we haven't even gotten a single ore yet we only did one mechanical box yeah it's been six hours it's been we play for a while yeah time flies when you Terraria yeah it kind of does five hours before I looked at the clock
[343:20.19]It was really fun, though.
[343:21.75]So, alright, how much more, like, okay, percentage-wise, like, how much more is there left to do that's reasonable to do?
[343:29.03]Not like, oh, I want to beat the last boss who has 5 trillion HP and I need every item in the game.
[343:37.18]Of the normal Terraria game...
[343:40.62]It's these three new ores gearing up, whatever you want to get.
[343:44.60]Then you fight Plantera, who's a big boss.
[343:49.12]Then Golem is done pretty quickly after that.
[343:52.47]Then I'm pretty sure right after Golem, you've got Cultists, then you have the Lunar Pillars, and then you have the Moon Lord, which is the classic final finish.
[344:02.15]Cool.
[344:02.29]And then Calamity has a bunch of shit after that, and Thorium has one boss after that.
[344:06.29]So, like...
[344:09.57]Even if we didn't do the super late game Calamity stuff, I'd say we're at most halfway through, but probably less than halfway.
[344:18.93]I mean, I'll finish it.
[344:21.11]I'll at least get to the end of the actual game.
[344:23.21]Do you want to do it again?
[344:25.05]Yeah.
[344:25.79]Getting to the end of Calamity is a little bit... Some of the late game Calamity stuff just gets so obnoxious to craft and the amount of stuff you have to keep track of is not actually fun anymore for me.
[344:36.89]Yeah, I don't know.
[344:37.67]I mean, that would be something I would want to do on my own time, I think.
[344:41.97]Yeah, but there's still a lot of stuff left to do.
[344:45.38]very easily another stream we wouldn't be done yeah I don't think unless we like really rushed it and I don't think we're gonna do that yeah well see you hey see you next week for uh Terraria are these things quacking
[345:01.42]Terraria episode three episode three actually well we would have done this this would have been episode let's see six hours we did how long was the last week's stream like six oh you're doing in like actual episode well because it would be like youtube episodes each episode would be about 10 to 15 minutes alright we'll say 20. no wait wasn't that a longer game you did 20. because then you 20 I don't know you can get two ads in it you can get the mid roll
[345:27.03]Okay, so two, four, that's three episodes an hour.
[345:29.01]Three, four, six, three, three, three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18.
[345:34.95]So we're, we're like episode like 37 of Terraria right now.
[345:42.84]Yeah.
[345:44.56]So tune in next week for the next week for episode 37.
[345:47.10]Yeah.
[345:49.91]yeah well um go get some sleep okay I'm hungry too I think that yeah that's probably a good place to call we're just under six hours maybe if you didn't start so late start so late
[346:07.02]Let's start at, like, 5 p.m.
[346:09.78]It was, like, 3 o'clock when I talked to you.
[346:12.30]Well, it's 5 for me.
[346:13.54]Yeah, well, I mean, I... Wait, hold on.
[346:15.90]I specifically asked you, like, yesterday when you wanted to start.
[346:21.15]And you were like, it doesn't matter, just hit me up.
[346:22.57]And I was like, I usually start around 3 or 4.
[346:24.17]And you're like, yeah, that's fine.
[346:25.71]I was being polite.
[346:26.65]Like, I was judging you the whole time.
[346:28.27]Well, why didn't you say, like, hey, can we start at, like, 1 or 2?
[346:30.29]I would have been like, alright.
[346:32.64]I asked you, like, twice.
[346:34.60]I'm just messing.
[346:38.15]Why are you doing this?
[346:39.07]A six-hour stream is like six hours longer than your usual one, so we're good.
[346:43.34]You haven't been paying very much attention.
[346:44.74]My average stream time is like seven to eight hours now.
[346:48.20]Is it?
[346:48.78]It's like six to eight hours.
[346:50.27]Yeah.
[346:50.81]I don't even believe you.
[346:51.77]You don't even pay attention anymore.
[346:53.83]Oh, my God.
[346:54.73]Like you pay attention to me.
[346:56.63]I do.
[347:09.38]Yeah, I think 90% of the streams I do, at least in the last, like, six months, have been at least six hours.
[347:17.86]Sometimes they're a little shorter, but sometimes they also go, like, 11 to 12 hours, too.
[347:23.76]Did he leave him, or am I still, like... No, no, no, I muted for, like, one second.
[347:29.30]You do not go for 11 hours.
[347:32.53]I went for almost 13 hours one time.
[347:34.61]Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[347:38.31]are you gonna no no no do it are you gonna like go to like my like Twitch stats or something and find out anybody who doesn't know this but if you actually check a streamer's videos section you can see what games they play when they play yeah oh my god I hear myself no so go go to my my vods and go look and tell me what the stream times are I'm looking because I'm I'm both surprised and like truly impressed that you can last at your age and at your health for seven hours I'm
[348:08.14]I'm as healthy as a goddamn ox, alright?
[348:11.68]No, that's good.
[348:13.04]I remember the good old days of, you know, Jerma two, three times a week, if you're lucky, of three-hour streams.
[348:22.48]Yeah, but I was still... It takes a lot to get used to transitioning from editing down, like, a seven-minute video.
[348:30.17]No.
[348:32.71]Like, I never used to do anything.
[348:34.69]I didn't do anything.
[348:37.44]No, when you make, like, videos... Like a ten-minute video one day, like anyone... Hey, somebody just mentioned this, yeah.
[348:45.09]I used to stream once every four or five months.
[348:48.45]So, I think we've evolved a little bit.
[348:51.07]Well, no, like, your first, like, I'm-gonna-be-streaming video was, like, I'm-gonna-be-streaming at least two or three times a week.
[348:59.50]No, I did.
[349:00.74]They were only, like, three or four hours long.
[349:05.14]That's what I mean.
[349:05.72]It's like, you did, like...
[349:08.78]Hey, I'm not sure how much you know this, but do you know that most people on Twitch do not stream for more than, like, four or five hours at a time?
[349:16.94]Did you know that?
[349:18.04]Like, nobody streams for, like, more than six to eight hours.
[349:21.28]A ton of people only stream for, like, three or four hours.
[349:24.70]Did you know that?
[349:25.36]I don't... I mean, a lot of people do, but I don't know if I'd go with, like, a ton.
[349:30.25]Like, not streaming is the Twitch meta.
[349:32.75]I'm telling you.
[349:40.39]calls out the entire platform no I but that's not calling anybody out that's saying like that but they also they also stream more days you understand well a lot of people that like oh like tim the tat man streams like four hours but he does it twice a day it's a lot
[350:09.13]I think you're just trying to downplay all the hard-working Twitch streamers because you think you're better than them now.
[350:17.48]But is this like... Oh, I'm playing a clam.
[350:20.10]He can talk.
[350:21.04]He can have his little talk.
[350:23.24]And everybody knows it's just bullshit.
[350:27.64]It's just noise.
[350:34.37]What?
[350:35.47]You just killed everybody.
[350:37.63]Please tell me that you...
[350:41.90]I didn't do this you killed everybody oh because he's oh my god I I'm leaving I'm out of here I had nothing to do with it I'm fighting it oh my god dude he's slaughtering everyone is this gonna be okay for next week no no wow like really you were the last person I would count on as a superhero
[351:12.23]The same thing before when people were dying.
[351:14.01]Oh my god, they're dying.
[351:15.86]What the fuck do you want me to do?
[351:17.94]Dude, what do you want me to do?
[351:21.32]I want you to fight the clam.
[351:22.66]I have all my shit spawned.
[351:26.36]You summoned the motherfucker in here.
[351:28.24]He killed everybody.
[351:29.66]What do you want me to do?
[351:30.44]I can't even spawn.
[351:31.57]There's clams in my spawn, grandma.
[351:33.69]If you rolled a grenade into my house, and like, oh shit, I'm gonna explode it.
[351:37.55]And you were like, dude, why didn't you do anything about that?
[351:40.80]Why weren't you prepared?
[351:43.22]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[351:45.20]I'm just saying, I'm not seeing you helping.
[351:56.02]Everybody's dead.
[351:59.96]Everybody is dead.
[352:19.57]The time it took.
[352:20.95]Dude.
[352:21.55]You know what?
[352:22.01]This is justice.
[352:23.37]This is justice for all the people that you, like, locked in here.
[352:26.81]Every single fucking person is gone.
[352:34.24]You deserved this for having such a terrible fucking house.
[352:37.98]Dude, they're all dead.
[352:41.50]Oh my god, that's fucking funny.
[352:45.24]The pig lived.
[352:49.68]That was- I can't- I can't believe- I can't believe you're not fighting back.
[352:55.14]I- I just like- I was like asleep in my bed.
[352:58.82]And you like stood over my bed with a frying pan and hit me right in the fucking face.
[353:04.34]And I- DING!
[353:06.24]Hey, dude, what- Get up and fight!
[353:11.48]Come on.
[353:13.26]Do something.
[353:16.49]That was fucking ridiculous.
[353:18.87]I just looked at you like, where's the fucking guide?
[353:21.05]I was trying to, like, I've never fought Clam after hard mode, and they give him a lot of shit.
[353:29.47]I don't know if he drops better stuff.
[353:31.45]Dude, that's the second time tonight that a spherical, like, Hey Arnold-shaped head object came crashing down instantly from the sky on me and scared the shit out of me.
[353:42.61]That happened at least two or three times.
[353:47.19]Oh my god.
[353:51.05]First was the UFO thing, and then that.
[353:55.74]Alright, well, how do we- do we have to clean this up, or is this- can we, like, can you roll the server back?
[354:02.72]No, this is how it is.
[354:04.14]We just got griefed, man.
[354:05.32]You have to, like, roll it back.
[354:06.60]We got griefed.
[354:11.16]Eh, it's fine.
[354:12.03]They'll come back.
[354:14.05]And what you do is you put in, like, a wanted ad.
[354:17.14]and craigslist and a bunch of fucking hopefuls show up oh spacious room big base oh we got extra tiles for our room they don't realize it's all vertical space oh like a thousand square foot apartment for everyone and it's all vertical
[354:35.14]Yeah, dude.
[354:35.56]Wow.
[354:36.26]This is really interesting.
[354:37.30]Hold on.
[354:38.60]That's a really good price for a 1,400 square foot apartment.
[354:43.50]Yeah, yeah.
[354:44.20]But you don't realize it's like three feet wide and fucking like 100 feet straight up.
[354:51.20]Close-knit community.
[354:52.59]Yeah, they're packed.
[354:57.43]Anyway, now that everyone's dead, it's definitely a great place to stop.
[355:01.91]yeah well now we have to now there's no clean up all these these tombstones we've never died in this game's easy so the people that like you know they were oh yeah that's it see you later see you next week we were really like whining down there and people that were like involved with this and like really paying attention what we were doing they're going to be like what the happened because then you know I already left yeah
[355:29.01]they're gonna think that we like were fucking around with each other and like throwing grenades in each other's like houses you don't do that that's the one thing you don't do is destroy houses you know what I'm saying people thought oh they're doing like a dynamite joke and they killed everybody nope like they were throwing dynamite at each other from across the way alright I'm I'm gonna leave and the nurse came back see we already got we already got one sucker someone's back
[355:59.33]Well, that's good.
[355:59.83]It's only going to take, like, four hours of game time for everybody to come back, right?
[356:09.88]Uh... Okay, I'm going to check one more thing before I'm done.
[356:16.06]As if there's, like, a wyvern up... God.
[356:17.96]And they... You... You killed these people.
[356:26.62]why me like I was I was very I was very vocal about how I didn't like this how they were here and you're like no no it's fine wasn't it though

[356:48.55]I'm going to take off.
[356:50.93]Okay.
[356:51.43]Thanks for playing, Star.
[356:52.49]I'll see you next time on Terraria.
[356:55.00]Next week.
[356:55.42]Wow.
[356:56.16]Next week when hopefully everybody respawns by then.
[357:02.00]Yeah.
[357:02.28]I'm going to stay in a little bit longer so we get some people to respawn and say my bye.
[357:05.94]But bye to you.
[357:07.10]Well, bye to you.
[357:07.88]Bye to your stream.
[357:08.62]Bye to your chat.
[357:09.47]Bye, guys.
[357:10.79]Always a pleasure.
[357:12.73]Have a great rest of your night.
[357:13.85]Get some food.
[357:14.43]Get some sleep.
[357:17.41]Ta-ta.
[357:26.31]And there we go.
[357:26.71]That was a nice little exit there.
[357:34.03]Get out of the game.
[357:37.53]Leave.
[357:40.01]Exit.
[357:40.37]Alright.
[357:44.87]So that was some more Terraria.
[357:48.39]It's fun.
[357:48.99]It's fun.
[357:49.33]It's just a... It's a game, you know?
[357:52.13]It's a video game.
[357:53.01]It's been a while since I've...
[357:56.43]actually played, like, a multiplayer video game with somebody and saw it to the end.
[358:01.89]So that should be fun.
[358:02.81]At least I want to see it just to get to the end.
[358:06.75]It's fun to make new stuff, look at new items.
[358:08.33]It's kind of overwhelming, but it's still a lot of fun.
[358:15.09]But, um, to give you guys some info here, I am not going to be back until at least Wednesday or Thursday.
[358:27.13]as of this stream.
[358:29.66]I'm going to be across the country.
[358:35.14]We're doing a facility walkthrough with all the people involved in the carnival stream, so I'm gonna be spending time working on that.
[358:40.96]We're gonna get that all hammered out.
[358:44.76]So I'm gonna try to stream on Wednesday.
[358:48.02]I'm gonna try to... I should be back by then.
[358:50.54]I'm hoping I am.
[358:53.65]So it shouldn't be more than one, two, three days
[358:59.30]Maybe three and a half, four days.
[359:03.56]At the very latest, you will see me back on Thursday.
[359:12.35]Is there a set date for the carnival?
[359:13.47]Yes, there is.
[359:14.13]September 21st.
[359:16.51]Mark it on your calendar, that's the date.
[359:22.32]I was warning you a few hours ago to put your arena away from your NPCs.
[359:26.58]Well, no, that's what I said to him.
[359:27.70]That's why I wanted to build it out to the left more.
[359:32.82]That was on him.
[359:34.58]That was his house.
[359:35.33]It's his server, his house.
[359:36.57]Install Calamity music for next time.
[359:46.05]Yeah, a lot of people are saying that.
[359:48.33]Calamity.
[359:53.97]Do we both have to have that, though?
[359:55.33]Because isn't it, like, if I don't have the same mods as him?
[360:01.34]I'll have to tell him.
[360:03.94]But, we're gonna do the bits and the subs.
[360:10.06]And then I've gotta get ready to go do this.
[360:15.48]I will have a shitload more details on exactly how this stream is gonna be done when I get back.
[360:26.40]Wish me luck.
[360:28.36]I'm equal parts excited and a little nervous, right?
[360:30.86]Because, obviously, anytime you try to do something like this, even like the Jerma Rumble video, any, like, big stream or big video is always like, alright, I want to make sure this is done right.
[360:41.09]So, I'm looking forward to it, though.
[360:46.39]I can't wait.
[360:48.90]So six hours ago, a while back now, we had ten bucks from Fussrow, Fussrow Boto.
[360:58.97]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[361:03.23]Thank you.
[361:03.57]They say, hey, I think I actually said the same thing last stream, but what would you recommend for someone playing Dark Souls 1?
[361:10.55]Oh, weapon-wise?
[361:11.29]I think we, yeah, we talked about, uh... You can really use anything in Dark Souls 1.
[361:15.85]It's whatever you feel like playing with.
[361:19.31]Except, um... What's a weapon you wouldn't use in Dark Souls 1?
[361:27.60]It's been a while since I played it.
[361:29.52]The last time I played it, it was like a joke stream, so... Don't use the broken sword.
[361:34.02]Yeah, the thing that you spawn with, don't use that.
[361:37.99]The whip and the fists.
[361:40.07]Yeah, the whip sucks.
[361:41.11]The whip sucks in every game.
[361:44.89]Does the whip have any purpose at all?
[361:47.04]Besides, it's like okay in some PvP scenarios, right?
[361:54.64]That's what I was under the impression of.
[361:56.72]Just do it for RP, right?
[362:06.60]Thank you to...
[362:11.40]Thank you to Dad, uh, thank you to Daddy for the $15 here.
[362:16.36]Thank you, uh, Dad.
[362:17.90]They say, Jerma uncensored, haha, oh god.
[362:21.14]Thank you for the $15.
[362:26.19]Thank you.
[362:27.13]Thank you, Dad.
[362:28.19]Appreciate that.
[362:32.33]That's it.
[362:32.79]That's all they say.
[362:35.61]Uh...
[362:42.35]Thank you to Kay White for the 250.
[362:44.87]Hey, Jerma.
[362:46.86]Mr. Pig and I just want to say, I grew up watching your videos and now I have your sense of humor.
[362:52.46]And because of that, no friends.
[362:54.90]Thanks.
[362:55.16]What are you talking about?
[362:58.12]Who's Mr. Pig?
[363:00.30]Who's Mr. Pig?
[363:01.04]That's a contradiction right there.
[363:22.84]Jerma sense of humor equals no humor at all.
[363:28.82]Alright, well, I mean, hold on.
[363:34.11]John Cena... John Cena says that?
[363:45.51]If you're gonna dish it, I'm gonna dish it back.
[363:55.86]Come on, you win a dish, I get a dish.
[363:57.46]I'll serve it up hot.
[364:07.89]Only reads the worst messages confirmed.
[364:14.62]No, I read a ton of good messages today.
[364:24.15]Come on, sometimes I've got a hot, steamy spaghetti here that I'm ready to serve sometimes.
[364:32.44]Dodging, like, mean comments.
[364:34.46]Like, what's that person?
[364:35.86]How about this one?
[364:40.73]No, I know you're fucking around.
[364:41.73]I'm just kidding.
[364:43.49]Don't worry.
[364:46.33]But thank you for the $2.50, though.
[364:47.17]Appreciate it.
[364:53.51]Also, thank you to... Devakitty for the $2.50.
[365:02.18]Here's some streamer pop quiz.
[365:03.46]What's the name of the 1986 action comedy film starring Paul Hogan as a weathered bushman from the Australian Outback?
[365:13.42]Is that... Crocodile Dundee?
[365:16.84]I got it.
[365:20.26]Yeah.
[365:20.88]What do I get?
[365:34.56]Oh.
[365:37.20]Okay.
[365:37.44]Uh, alright.
[365:42.49]Well, that was elaborate.
[365:43.33]Thank you.
[365:43.69]Uh, thank you to... Thank you to Daydream88 for the ten bucks.
[365:51.88]Thousand bits.
[365:52.60]Thank you, Daydream.
[365:54.89]Japan.
[366:25.37]It's really weird to think that I've been doing this for over eight years.
[366:33.58]And then some people may have been like in high school or even like younger.
[366:39.47]And like now they're fucking like grownups.
[366:42.79]Like, oh yeah, I started watching you when I was like in college and now I'm 30.
[366:47.87]Like, holy shit.
[366:57.66]And that's me, too.
[366:58.70]Like, that's me as well.
[367:08.66]So, it'll be interesting.
[367:10.35]When I actually cross the 10-year mark, it's going to be an interesting milestone.
[367:19.45]But it's coming quicker than any of us think.
[367:23.56]But Daydream, thank you so much.
[367:24.82]Good luck in Japan.
[367:28.36]Thanks for sticking around for that long.
[367:35.61]A lobotomized teddy bear.
[367:37.33]Thanks for the $2.50.
[367:38.15]Jeremiah, I'm in Boston for a few days right now and I've never been.
[367:40.61]What would you recommend I should do or try or see?
[367:43.77]Thanks and keep being a funny man.
[367:47.00]First, somebody asked us a few months ago and we had some good ideas.
[367:50.36]The Museum of Science is awesome.
[367:53.06]If you get a chance...
[367:58.56]I would say to anybody that was coming from anywhere else that Boston has probably the best museum of science I've probably ever been to.
[368:07.42]There's tons of awesome shit there.
[368:10.60]If you have, if you're traveling with like family and there's younger kids, the Children's Museum is awesome too.
[368:20.93]That whole area is really good.
[368:22.15]Go to Faneuil Hall.
[368:24.01]There's tons of great like shopping and restaurants and stuff.
[368:32.78]There's a lot of interesting stuff.
[368:34.66]Restaurants.
[368:38.50]There are so many restaurants in Boston.
[368:40.31]It's hard to even tell you to go to one.
[368:47.81]But I would definitely say Museum of Science.
[368:51.01]If you have young siblings or cousins or something that you're with.
[368:54.80]Children's Museum.
[368:57.30]Then Faneuil Hall.
[369:01.86]I'd say that's probably... I mean, check out, like, Fenway.
[369:05.90]Fenway's awesome, too.
[369:07.11]If you can get in the... If you like baseball, even just being around Fenway, it's, like, right in there.
[369:12.07]So you've got plenty of opportunities to kind of be part of the scene.
[369:15.51]It's pretty good.
[369:18.23]I wouldn't recommend the duck boats.
[369:20.77]That's kind of... I don't know if I would recommend somebody to do that.
[369:31.36]There's nothing wrong with the duck boats, but the duck boats really is a kind of I'm out of town guy in a Hawaiian shirt with the kind of sunscreen all over his nose and glasses around his neck kind of thing to do.
[369:46.81]You know what I'm saying?
[369:49.61]It's a very like touristy thing to do.
[369:54.78]I don't know if you just kind of float around and drive around.
[369:59.02]If you really, really want to do something insanely touristy, Boston has a pretty famous duck boats.
[370:14.92]But if you're into that, then absolutely do it.
[370:18.66]It is a subterranean vehicle.
[370:21.34]It goes on the ground and then goes underground.
[370:24.54]Well, no, you don't.
[370:25.54]Like, it just floats.
[370:26.96]It's a boat.
[370:27.42]It's a car boat that drives around and then you float.
[370:30.50]You don't submerge.
[370:39.00]But, uh, have fun.
[370:41.10]It's a very, very, very interesting city.
[370:43.74]It's got a lot of history.
[370:48.93]a historical place in the united states but a freudian weapon thank you for the 250 freudian happy Terraria Saturday jermaHeart love this game but love watching you and Ster play it even more I also wanted to wish you safe travels in the coming weeks prepping for the carnival stream good luck be safe and have fun one more jermaHeart
[371:11.26]Yeah, it's a pretty easy trip.
[371:15.16]I'm not spending a week there.
[371:18.35]Not yet.
[371:21.45]This is going to be a fairly quick turnaround, I think.
[371:23.97]It's not going to be a situation where I have to be out there for a long time.
[371:26.39]But it should be fun.
[371:34.05]Thank you.
[371:34.37]I really appreciate it.
[371:35.53]And Terraria is a lot of fun.
[371:39.35]That's why I'm going to see it to its at least base game completion.
[371:46.85]Uh, Fooey!
[371:48.34]Thank you, Fooey.
[371:50.40]For the host.
[371:52.82]And I thought you gave subs here, too.
[371:54.80]But thank you, Fooey, for the host.
[371:57.41]I might as well just say thanks.
[372:02.21]I thought it was subs under there, but sometimes my brain is wrong.
[372:06.49]But I do appreciate it.
[372:07.13]Thank you.
[372:08.03]Hey, Croacher, thanks for the five subs.
[372:09.89]There you are, Croacher.
[372:10.67]That was a while ago, and I think I missed it.
[372:15.89]I was really tunnel vision tonight.
[372:23.48]Is it actually over, the stream?
[372:25.62]What was the length?
[372:27.28]Six hours and fifteen minutes.
[372:28.98]Just about.
[372:35.47]Let's go up here.
[372:37.11]That was too late.
[372:50.40]Uh, Phylactery Lich, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[372:52.50]I said it.
[372:53.97]I caught it.
[372:55.65]But we were in the middle of a... of a... of a gaming argument.
[373:00.29]But thanks for the 50 bucks, Phylactery.
[373:01.93]Local streamer called out on past stream set schedule.
[373:04.35]Defend self.
[373:05.73]He's come a long way.
[373:09.98]Yeah.
[373:11.04]Alright.
[373:12.04]This is what I was trying to say before...
[373:15.35]He, look, he opened up my past streaming schedule shit, and he was like, oh, alright, hold on, I was wrong here.
[373:24.37]Going from making a video that is seven to eight minutes, and not having to be live in front of people for more than, you know... I didn't really do it that often.
[373:34.89]You, like, kind of build up your comfort level to do it.
[373:39.06]And I'm not gonna lie, two years ago, three years ago...
[373:43.35]It's a lot different.
[373:44.93]It was a big change to, hey, instead of sitting here and playing a game and trying to do funny, weird, interesting things in Dark Souls and not even getting out of the tutorial room for three hours, it was, hey, I'm going to be here and there's people going to be here.
[374:01.42]Nobody used to be in the room.
[374:04.96]You know?
[374:05.54]Like, nobody is in the room now, but it was just me.
[374:10.15]And transitioning from it's just me to there might be thousands of people here, you need to kind of build up, like, a stamina to be able to say, oh, it's been an hour or two.
[374:22.31]Okay, um, I think I'm done.
[374:25.37]It's been three hours.
[374:26.67]Uh, yeah, that's, uh, bye.
[374:44.78]Nobody to yell that the joke you just said sucked?
[374:48.36]Yeah.
[374:50.45]That's, yeah, like, you know what I mean?
[374:52.61]So it's like a different, it's a different beast.
[374:56.41]I could say something stupid and then put it in a YouTube video and not know if people thought it was funny until like potentially a week later.
[375:06.10]I get instant feedback now.
[375:16.38]So yeah, now I can stream for six, seven, eight hours at a time, and it's fine.
[375:20.12]It didn't used to be the case, though.
[375:38.46]Instant conflict, yeah.
[375:45.93]But, yeah, that's... That's 50 bucks from Phylactery.
[375:50.45]Thank you.
[375:53.27]And then finally here, Tingy.
[375:54.96]Can we make it official and call these weekly streams Sterraria Saturdays?
[376:01.88]No, I've come to the decision and realization that you cannot name anything a day of the week ever again.
[376:09.81]Because, oh, it's Scare Saturdays.
[376:11.91]It's Terraria Saturdays.
[376:13.31]What if we can't do it on Saturday?
[376:16.05]Oh shit, we have to do it on Saturday now.
[376:19.14]There has to be a Scare Saturdays on Saturday instead of just being, just do it when you can.
[376:26.29]You know, what if we do Terraria on Friday?
[376:29.09]It's like, oh, shit, man.
[376:31.53]Time to rebrand everything.
[376:34.33]So, I'm against naming days of the week in a title.
[376:49.76]You stop Scare Saturdays because you're a coward.
[376:53.30]Yeah, I don't know.
[376:54.84]Fine.
[376:55.36]Say it.
[376:55.76]But I also ran out of, like, kind of scary games to play for a little while.
[376:59.36]But scary games suck.
[377:01.88]They're really fucking stressful.
[377:04.72]And I'll tell you, I'm not gonna bullshit you.
[377:06.79]It got to a point where it would be, like, Thursday night and I would know I was gonna record something for Saturday or, like, Friday night or even on Saturday afternoon.
[377:15.65]And I'd be like, fuck, man, I don't... I don't wanna play a scary game right now.
[377:19.17]Fuck, it's gonna scare... I'm gonna get, like, stressed out and...
[377:29.12]You kind of have to make yourself want to do it in a way.
[377:40.71]Jump scares and all that, yeah.
[377:44.17]VR horror games are a blast to watch you play.
[377:46.27]I had to have lost at least a few years of my life.
[377:55.11]There was at least two or three parts of that game that would just... It was such a jump in such a scary scenario... That it... My... Like, I definitely took at least, like, three years of blood pumping capability away from my heart.
[378:09.52]Like, at the end of my life.
[378:11.14]Plus, I'm a super high-strung, neurotic kind of person anyways.
[378:20.49]So you add in terrifying jump scares...
[378:26.79]Just dials it up to a thousand.
[378:34.55]But let's get the credits on here.
[378:36.38]These are all the subs.
[378:38.92]From the last six hours or so.
[378:48.42]Here they come.
[378:49.64]In just a second.
[378:52.86]I promise you they'll be here.
[378:55.50]I'm telling you.
[378:56.52]In just a second.
[378:57.18]Any minute.
[379:00.25]Here they come.
[379:02.43]There they are.
[379:03.33]I knew it.
[379:07.77]But I will see you guys next week.
[379:11.46]I'm going to try to stream on Wednesday.
[379:15.94]But if for some reason I'm not done with whatever I'm doing, then by the absolute latest I'll be back on Thursday.
[379:29.22]And I will bring news with me.
[379:33.96]Get this out of the way.
[379:42.68]Get this out of the way.
[379:49.94]Thank you.
[379:52.48]Wing for the five dollars.
[379:53.40]What's the best Dark Souls 1 weapon?
[380:01.40]Thanks for the five dollars, though.
[380:02.40]But I don't know.
[380:03.34]I don't know.
[380:07.12]Um... The katana?
[380:11.70]The drake sword.
[380:12.51]There you go.
[380:13.07]The drake sword.
[380:13.95]The drake sword.
[380:14.67]The thing where you cut the tail off of the dragon.
[380:17.85]They use that for, like, the rest of the game.
[380:21.81]Until, like, you fight... Uh, it's not, though.
[380:26.94]Well, I'm just gonna save that now.
[380:30.32]I'm just gonna say it's the Break Sword.
[380:31.58]This Gweander is good.
[380:43.16]Yeah.
[380:44.32]Most of the two-handed weapons, the two-handed swords are good, right?
[380:48.58]Black Knight Sword, Black Knight Halberd.
[380:53.25]Black Knight Great Sword?
[381:02.69]It's zvayhander, not zweyhander.
[381:07.63]Meh.
[381:09.19]That's alright.
[381:10.61]I can beat either one.
[381:18.92]Well, there you go.
[381:19.40]You got, like... There's at least... 12 weapons that have been put into chat.
[381:24.62]Hopefully you find one.
[381:27.71]Zwey.
[381:30.75]Oh, the shpeehander.
[381:39.50]Ugh.
[381:44.84]Blackout Halberd's a speedrunner weapon, so it's probably good.
[381:49.24]Yeah, don't they stack it up with something too?
[381:50.88]They put a ring on and get to like one health?
[382:02.81]Red Tearstone Ring?
[382:03.65]Yeah, that's the one.
[382:10.84]He said it.
[382:12.56]What?
[382:14.64]He said the line.
[382:16.56]Oh, the speed.
[382:22.64]Speed.
[382:23.98]But anyways, I'll see you guys next week.
[382:27.72]Have a great rest of your weekend.
[382:31.15]I know I mentioned this before, but I want to make sure because I know there's some people that are wondering if I am going to be there.
[382:35.47]I probably will not be at Evo tomorrow.
[382:39.28]I knew I was thinking maybe I could get there for an hour or two or something, but I'm not going to be there, I don't think.
[382:45.54]So if you... Oh, he said he may be there on Sunday.
[382:49.22]I'm no longer planning on doing it.
[382:55.75]But take care of yourselves.
[382:58.33]See you next week.
[383:00.77]Much love, guys.
[383:01.57]See you soon.
