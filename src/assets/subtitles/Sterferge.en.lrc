[00:05.78]Change it from like simple to like good and then take a look around.
[00:09.18]That looks pretty good.
[00:12.60]Yeah.
[00:13.18]Why does it look like I'm looking into the inside of my computer?
[00:19.41]I'm looking at microchips.
[00:20.47]Oh my god, walk around.
[00:21.87]It's like magnified grass.
[00:24.98]Walk.
[00:28.35]Oh, it really is.
[00:29.53]It's like a bunch of movie screens.
[00:32.25]Who's watching me?
[00:33.86]It's you.
[00:34.38]You're watching.
[00:35.24]No, you have to walk into one of them.
[00:36.72]It takes you to another dream dimension.
[00:38.28]Yeah, I thought that too.
[00:39.16]I thought it was going to be amazing.
[00:40.64]Turns out they're all just bushes.
[00:42.56]Yeah.
[00:44.16]Oh, what's this crazy?
[00:45.16]Oh, it's a bush.
[00:46.28]What's that over here?
[00:47.16]It's a bush.
[00:48.77]Something tells me we're going to need to reload the game.
[00:51.13]I'm not doing it.
[00:52.53]You're gonna play the game like this?
[00:54.51]Yeah, we're just gonna move on.

[01:00.17]My mom got me a hamster.
[01:01.43]Oh, be gentle.
[01:02.67]Yeah.
[01:05.95]Try and get your view and, like, see where the tunnels are.
[01:08.65]Yeah, maybe, like, another, like, 100 feet this way.
[01:18.83]Something else it's starting to show me now is my gun in my hand.
[01:21.75]What the fuck, it's a Hydralisk!
[01:23.75]Huh?

[01:48.98]the whole thing.
[01:50.06]Mm-hmm.
[01:50.84]I'm gonna get to the top of that and I'm going to jump off.

[02:20.73]You like my moon shoes?
[02:23.89]Well, use your moon shoes and fix the spinnies that aren't spinning.
[02:28.47]How do I do that?
[02:28.99]Do I just remove them?
[02:29.77]Yeah, you have to hold key, you have to get in there.
[02:33.63]What button is it?
[02:34.37]Just make sure there's a couple of glow sticks in here.
[02:36.76]Alright.
[02:39.64]Uh, what button do I press?
[02:42.34]Where did you go?
[02:43.52]Blue.

[02:52.13]Woah!
[02:58.34]Woah!
[02:59.22]What's going on?
[02:59.92]What is that?
[03:00.24]Turn it off!
[03:01.64]What the fuck is that?
[03:04.40]Is that a truck full of bees?
[03:10.50]No!
[03:10.84]No!
[03:11.38]No!
[03:12.01]No!
[03:12.53]No!
[03:12.75]What are you doing?
[03:13.43]Are you alive?
[03:15.97]Yeah.
[03:17.10]Where are you?
[03:19.36]They're following you now.
[03:20.52]At least half of them.
[03:21.56]I love how they're doing this.
[03:23.72]That's so awesome.
[03:25.34]You've got a pyramid and I've got a pyramid.
[03:27.24]We need to bring them together.
[03:28.34]We need to make a bigger pyramid.
[03:37.93]They're on me.
[03:45.03]They're on me.
[03:49.05]He just like toppled it over.
[03:57.13]How are these guys not dead?
[03:58.53]I don't know.
[04:00.11]It's absurd.
[04:03.95]Why would you build this?
[04:05.65]What's the point?
[04:08.59]There is always a point.
[04:10.55]Progress.
[04:13.62]Hey, yeah, I, uh, I don't know, I'm not sure if the helipad is in the correct spot, but, uh, I... That sucked!
[04:20.20]Did it just get launched out?
[04:22.14]It just tapped one of them and boop, it's out.
[04:25.06]Not even dramatically.
[04:25.92]Here, we're doing this again.
[04:31.64]Are there enough of them?
[04:33.14]No, not enough of them.
[04:35.06]Okay, yeah, no, there's enough.
[04:36.04]There's enough of them.
[04:36.98]There's enough.
[04:37.36]That's enough.
[04:38.28]We're down to, like, 14 frames a second.
[04:43.18]A Hydralisk is in here, like, fighting them.
[04:49.86]This Hydralisk is pissed.
[04:56.03]This Hydralisk is still here.
[05:01.79]Dude, I gotta get out of here.
[05:03.78]I'm about to exit the game.
[05:06.36]Oh!
[05:08.38]Through the wall.
[05:15.33]Am I wearing it on your screen?
[05:19.47]It's like five mini guns.
[05:22.55]It's like, wait, wait, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[05:26.00]It's seven mini guns.
[05:27.08]There is just seven mini guns coming out of random places on your body.
[05:32.50]Can I shoot them?
[05:39.67]I just ripped my headset off.
[05:49.17]I think you can shoot them.
[05:52.65]Did that kill you?
[05:54.49]Oh yeah, absolutely.
[05:55.83]Alright, what if I shoot it down?
[06:08.84]A star.
[06:19.67]You ever seen the movie, Jason?
[06:22.53]Ow!
[06:23.35]Ow!
[06:29.52]No!
[06:30.88]No!
[06:33.90]Well, I've met ten brains in a second.
[06:35.54]I can't tell what's happening.
[06:36.32]All I know is I'm just trying to keep myself alive.
[06:38.64]What is happening?
[06:40.50]Yeah, you've done a terrible thing down here.
[06:44.95]You put too many down here.
[06:46.97]You put way too many.
[06:48.09]I need to get out of the pit!
[06:50.92]Help me!
[06:51.20]I'm stuck here.
[06:52.29]I can't get out.
[06:52.77]Where's the little safe hole?
[06:55.07]Good luck finding it.
[06:55.95]I'm getting launched back up.
[06:58.87]No, I'm not.
[06:59.59]I get the safe hole.
[07:00.59]The safe hole.
[07:01.25]They're all... No, no, no, no.
[07:02.73]I see it.
[07:03.19]I see the safe hole.
[07:04.73]You've got to get in the safe hole, dude.
[07:07.49]Shut up.
[07:08.03]I know.
[07:08.93]Come on.
[07:09.23]You've got to get in the safe hole.
[07:15.40]I'm in the... No!
[07:16.66]Dead.
[07:19.33]I think I got in the safe hole and you fucking chainsawed me.
[07:24.88]You punk.
[07:26.09]You're gonna get what's coming to you.
