[33:42.17]Alright, now I can buy the, uh, I can buy the helmet.
[33:55.78]Wait, semi-finals?
[33:58.18]Oh, shit, that's right, you play a bunch of these.
[34:00.76]Alright.
[34:09.01]Get the diaper costume?
[34:10.89]Don't worry.
[34:11.55]I promise I'm going to get a shitload of points.
[34:13.89]Alright, this time I'm not going to fuck around.
[34:16.57]I actually want to win.
[34:24.80]Nigeria.
[34:27.46]The comeback kid.
[34:32.04]It's a shitload for the diaper?
[34:36.66]Timber.
[34:41.37]I got it.
[34:41.67]In, in, in, in, drain it.
[34:54.01]That was perfect.
[34:56.13]Holy shit, you did a perfect shot and I didn't even get the fucking ball.
[35:00.72]You fucking moron.
[35:02.54]How did you do that?
[35:04.18]Get it!
[35:05.58]How are you missing these?
[35:06.78]This is unbelievable.
[35:21.91]Just run, dude.
[35:25.83]Nobody get it.
[35:26.83]Why is he so slow?
[35:31.39]You sound like my high school coach.
[35:42.21]Nobody can even... This is the worst Olympic basketball ever.
[35:51.42]This isn't like the peewee leagues.
[35:55.82]Oh, come on.
[36:04.32]Somebody scored a point.
[36:05.30]That's in.
[36:18.84]Alright, whatever.
[36:19.42]It's two points.
[36:19.90]It's fine.
[36:20.16]I can get back.
[36:33.29]It was perfect, too.
[36:34.05]That's what it said.
[36:34.65]Are we just letting him do that?
[36:38.75]Alright, get it.
[36:46.19]Come on.
[36:47.45]What the fuck?
[36:51.33]How did you miss that?
[36:55.51]You walked out of bounds.
[37:07.52]This would be a great score for soccer.
[37:09.99]It would.
[37:18.29]Get it?
[37:18.60]Alright, whatever.
[37:19.62]Just get a two-pointer.
[37:20.32]Get in there and dunk.
[37:22.22]Throw the fucking ball!
[37:23.06]What are you doing?! !
[37:33.92]Can you imagine going to a basketball game?
[37:36.74]Basketball?
[37:37.64]Basketball game.
[37:38.42]I'm not drunk.
[37:39.16]I've had coffee and water today.
[37:42.49]And it's 3-2 in the third quarter of the fourth quarter.
[37:47.21]I would assume that, like, they were all spun around in a circle a hundred times.
[37:52.92]They're playing kickball.
[37:54.40]That's a perfect fucking drain right there.
[38:03.16]No way.
[38:04.26]Oh, fuck you.
[38:05.34]God damn it.
[38:05.82]Alright, I gotta do this now.
[38:14.85]I'm gonna lose.
[38:22.10]How did you not get the ball?
[38:23.36]I don't understand.
[38:24.08]How did you not pick the ball up?
[38:25.46]What the fuck are these guys doing?
[38:38.04]Whatever, I got points.
[38:39.92]Advance to the bronze medal match.
[38:41.30]Wait a minute.
[38:42.13]Oh, I'm not out.
[38:45.47]While dribbling, input left to right to perform a spin move.
[38:47.99]I wish I knew that.
[38:51.21]Why do you get to unlock tutorials in this game?
[38:53.63]Just tell me how to play.
[39:06.80]This is a pity match?
[39:13.03]It's not.
[39:14.51]That's it.
[39:29.90]Shoot it!
[39:38.26]I don't play basketball.
[39:39.18]I'm not a basketball guy.
[39:40.22]Give me the baseball game and I'll show you a fucking home run.
[39:43.06]I swear to God.
[39:43.68]I don't even know what's happening.
[39:44.72]This is a perfect shot right here.
[40:12.72]I don't even, okay.
[40:13.48]Guys, you know how many, I don't even understand the rules of basketball.
[40:22.84]I don't even know how this is played.
[40:23.97]What the fuck are you doing?
[40:31.85]I didn't, I didn't mean to do that.
[40:33.05]Dunk.
[40:41.01]I almost missed the dunk.
[40:52.28]What the hell are you doing?
[40:53.37]Why would you do that?
[40:54.11]I'm not even trying to do that shit.
[40:55.27]There it is.
[41:21.35]Fight him!
[41:28.39]Where's this person going?
[41:29.29]Wait, what?
[41:30.55]Wait, what?
[41:31.71]Wait, what?
[41:33.07]Hold on a second.
[41:33.79]Why were we... I'm really confused.
[41:48.08]What was that soccer throw?
[41:56.15]It's in.
[41:58.52]Holy shit, that was awesome.
[42:00.00]I want to play NBA Street.
[42:01.18]This makes me want to play NBA Street so bad.
[42:12.27]That's the best sports game I think I ever made.
[42:14.81]Besides NFL Blitz League.
[42:20.95]Come on.
[42:23.42]Down court, down court, down court.
[42:24.54]I'm already there.
[42:34.24]It's traveling.
[42:36.32]That was traveling, wasn't it?
[42:49.70]Whatever, I still win.
[42:50.42]I'm just going to run the clock out.
[42:53.81]Fuck it.
[43:16.34]Howard it's a one-point game.
[43:17.72]I'm not gonna do that I thought I just punched that lady in the face.
[43:25.55]I thought I just swung and punched her Alright, we got bronze
[43:40.17]All I care about is points, I don't care about winning.
[43:43.81]See?
[43:45.97]Now we can unlock more stupid outfits.
[43:53.96]Okay, outfits.
[43:59.72]Um... Baseball.
[44:06.44]Change this outfit.
[44:14.58]Okay, that's, I mean, that's quite comical, I think.
[44:24.37]What's we got here?
[44:25.37]Uh, I got the suit of armor.
[44:26.39]It's like Samus?
[44:37.03]What is this one?
[44:43.57]astronaut.
[44:45.21]Oh, let me get the hat.
[44:45.89]Okay.
[44:52.89]I need the dinosaur one.
[45:01.66]Definitely need bunny ears.
[45:04.48]Oh, I don't have enough.
[45:05.08]Okay.
[45:13.40]Alright, let's do baseball.
[45:19.13]Let's see how baseball is.
[45:33.64]I wonder how this works.
[45:34.66]Was it two innings?
[45:35.28]Three innings?
[45:42.44]In baseball, yeah, I know how baseball works.
[45:47.25]Use L to choose of the available pitches and press A to select it.
[45:49.41]Then use L to choose where to throw the ball.
[45:51.65]Okay.
[45:55.75]Press A at the right time to hit the ball.
[45:59.00]Move the cursor where the ball will be thrown, press A, alright.
[46:02.46]Throw a special ball, press left bumper when the gauge is full.
[46:04.76]Okay, so it's just Nicktoons baseball.
[46:13.51]That doesn't make an entire team.
[46:16.67]The bat matches the clothes.
[46:18.77]That's awesome.
[46:22.55]What's in there?
[46:43.05]Drunk baseball.
[46:48.09]It's really slow.
[46:49.41]It's gonna take me a minute to figure this out.
[46:53.81]Get in there.
[46:56.89]Get in there!
[47:06.92]Why is it shaking?
[47:16.97]Alright, whatever.
[47:22.08]Not gonna get anything off me.
[47:22.90]Am I pitching?
[47:23.50]Good.
[47:25.40]Alright, let's do four-seam fastball.
[47:29.58]And let's put it in the top.
[47:31.12]Is that a ball?
[47:32.47]Alright, I think it's weird how this works.
[47:34.77]Alright, let's do four-seam fastball.
[47:46.01]I don't know.
[47:57.64]We'll let this guy on the field.
[48:03.96]How do you make the guy puke on the mound?
[48:08.18]I don't think you can.
[48:08.80]What the fuck was that?
[48:26.30]Alright, whatever.
[48:27.48]I'll do better.
[48:33.83]Catch the ball.
[48:34.57]Why are they all faces?
[48:39.79]Stick to basketball.
[48:41.73]No, this is weird.
[48:51.50]Split it down.
[48:52.46]No, split it in the middle of the drop down.
[48:55.08]There it is.
[48:59.33]Curve ball.
[49:00.49]Up.
[49:00.89]It'll drop down into the zone.
[49:02.61]Got him.
[49:02.85]Same thing.
[49:06.99]Do it again.
[49:07.57]Change up.
[49:09.76]Right down the fucking middle he's gonna be.
[49:11.10]He's gonna freak out.
[49:12.84]There it is.
[49:21.98]Oh!
[49:22.04]This is the worst giraffe pick.
[49:31.94]Wait, I have a super move.
[49:37.16]I'm not going to use it.
[49:38.13]Why would I use it right now?
[49:43.95]Wait, you can see his ass crack?
[49:55.50]I got to get the batting down.
[49:56.46]It's different in every game.
[50:00.61]There it is.
[50:01.69]Oh, fuck off.
[50:10.50]It's so slow.
[50:13.12]Get in there.
[50:18.44]Alright, give me that power.
[50:19.89]Tie it up with a home run right here.
[50:23.09]Do I have a power move yet?
[50:31.49]That slow ass shit, I hate it.
[50:34.22]Up the middle.
[50:57.64]That's in there.
[50:58.86]Why is every single one of these in the infield?
[51:01.10]I'm fucking hitting them perfectly fine.
[51:04.30]I think my team just sucks.
[51:11.03]We can't even hit the fucking ball out of the infield.
[51:14.99]Or is this a case where I have to unlock the second part of how to swing the bat?
[51:18.24]0-2.
[51:35.05]Alright, I'm fine.
[51:38.39]Letta.
[51:41.29]Alright, we're going in.
[51:47.06]Yep.
[51:51.70]We're seeing fastball up and in challenge.
[51:54.52]Alright, we're good.
[51:58.30]How many innings are there?
[52:04.04]Do I have to sub out a pitcher?
[52:12.82]Challenge.
[52:14.32]Yep.
[52:16.76]Change up.
[52:19.46]Down.
[52:20.82]Sit down.
[52:23.76]I missed Gur's commentary.
[52:26.44]That's right.
[52:26.87]He did.
[52:27.49]He was in the game.
[52:28.19]Okay.
[52:32.33]Come on.
[52:32.89]Let's go.
[52:38.99]There's got to be something else I can do to hit the ball, not just A. What's in there?
[52:47.89]Thank God, finally.
[52:48.75]How do you run the bases?
[52:55.71]I think I almost have a power move.
[52:56.83]Get in there.
[53:01.63]Alright, here we go.
[53:06.84]Here we go.
[53:07.26]Big hitter.
[53:16.55]Oh, fuck.
[53:17.71]They all like this.
[53:23.08]Charge up the swing?
[53:24.14]No, you can't.
[53:26.18]Can you really?
[53:30.26]You liars.
[53:31.64]Why would you lie?
[53:40.30]Oh, and two.
[53:49.13]Alright, game over.
[53:51.63]To do a power swing, press B. To hit the bar out of the infield, press X. Did I not even get... Whatever.
[54:08.10]Individual swimming.
[54:09.14]Alright, I want to do boxing with Sonic the Hedgehog.
[54:19.11]Left stick for left punch, right stick for right punch.
[54:22.07]Which key you press.
[54:25.05]You'll guard automatically, but you can also hold right bumper to guard.
[54:27.53]Press left trigger and right trigger is sidestep.
[54:34.72]Special blow is left bumper and R when the gauge is full.
[54:37.32]Alright.
[54:38.08]Alright, let's just kick the shit out of this person.
[54:45.52]United Arab Emirates.
[54:49.55]I have no idea what's going on.
[55:31.11]Depending on what button I press?
[55:33.25]I think it's just hooks.
[55:36.58]Alright, block him.
[55:43.28]I didn't... Oh, come on.
[55:44.14]Counter that shit.
[55:50.79]Why do you have so many power moves?
[56:07.72]Was that illegal?
[56:08.42]I think that was illegal.
[56:26.42]He's got super moves.
[56:38.18]Oh, shit.
[56:40.16]I think I killed him.
[56:48.29]No way you get up from that one.
[56:53.67]Oh, what?
[57:04.88]Oh, I perfect blocked.
[57:13.96]What?
[57:20.58]Uppercuts.
[57:20.98]Uppercuts.
[57:25.35]Going down.
[57:25.93]Going down.
[57:26.55]Going down.
[57:27.13]One.
[57:30.23]Two.
[57:31.41]Three.
[57:32.65]Four.
[57:34.81]Five.
[57:36.24]Six.
[57:37.38]Seven.
[57:38.46]Eight.
[57:39.72]Nine.
[57:41.18]That was 10.
[57:41.82]You don't stop at 9 right there.
[57:43.16]Come on.
[57:48.84]Alright, this is getting embarrassing.
[57:50.58]You know what I mean?
[57:51.94]This is when the UFC ref comes in after I've hit the person in the face 8 times.
[57:55.71]Hammer fisting them.
[57:56.41]You know what I'm talking about?
[58:01.75]When they're on the ground and it's like bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[58:04.07]Alright, alright, that's enough.
[58:06.35]Alright.
[58:11.43]Okay, this is, like seriously, stop the fight.
[58:27.02]Let's go for the gold medal.
[58:34.32]Does anybody else feel like this would be awesome?
[58:41.49]If it was Sonic versus Mario and shit, and video game characters, and cartoon characters, and a TV show and movie characters and stuff, that'd be awesome.
[58:50.55]Alright, let's go.
[59:08.38]It's called Smash Brothers.
[59:09.42]No, but I'm talking about two people in costumes fighting in a real ring.
[59:16.55]This guy's got a really, really strong punch.
[59:24.55]Why are they calling me a rookie still?
[59:30.64]Alright, I get how it plays.
[59:32.12]Let's do some good boxing here.
[59:48.00]Shit!
[59:48.42]No!
[59:51.24]Fuck!
[59:53.48]I'm going down!
[59:57.44]Watch for the face!
[60:01.06]Come on, dude!
[60:17.46]Knock him out!
[60:18.02]Come on!
[60:18.68]Yes!
[60:28.18]You can headbutt?
[60:28.92]I thought I was doing the same thing.
[60:38.73]I was doing the same shit, man.
[60:47.93]Fuck.
[60:48.57]Time it.
[60:49.41]Alright, I'm gonna knock him down here.
[60:54.03]He's going down.
[60:54.47]Ready?
[60:54.63]See you later.
[60:56.21]Fuck.
[60:58.49]Don't lose it here.
[61:05.35]Oh, fuck.
[61:05.89]I'm down.
[61:07.22]How do I get up?
[61:09.84]How do I get up?
[61:10.26]What do I do?
[61:22.32]He came back fighting.
[61:27.64]Okay.
[61:29.74]He hit his head on the ceiling.
[61:31.04]Alright, I'm ahead.
[61:41.38]Alright, I won that round.
[61:53.78]I was gonna do the same shit.
[61:56.02]Alright, he's done.
[62:15.68]Need a cigarette in his mafia.
[62:23.35]Come on, give me a perfect block.
[62:29.40]Blocked it.
[62:32.44]Ready?
[62:32.84]He's going down right here.
[62:34.02]Check it out.
[62:36.47]Alright, come.
[62:56.04]Can you win by judges?
[62:57.76]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[63:06.63]The round is over.
[63:08.01]What?
[63:16.76]This is gonna have to go to decision.
[63:26.49]I win.
[63:29.09]Yep.
[63:31.76]All 10s.
[63:32.24]I just want to take that mask off.
[63:43.54]I want to take the head off.
[63:45.39]Look at the sweaty hair and how red this person's face is.
[63:48.21]How flush and sweaty their hair is and stuff.
[63:55.99]Wait, there's another event?
[63:57.13]Oh, fuck, okay, there's another event.
[64:00.75]I gotta- this is for the gold medal!
[64:12.88]Wait, did I get some tips?
[64:16.17]I need to see new tips, but whatever, I don't need to play.
[64:20.13]Genius.
[64:20.89]Alright, we both have the same colors.
[64:27.41]The bell didn't even ring.
[64:28.59]That's not fair.
[64:29.35]The fuck was that?
[64:30.39]Fuck.
[64:44.93]What?
[64:45.33]Already?
[64:48.11]She started punching before the bell even rang.
[65:07.94]I can't- I can't- I literally can't even do anything.
[65:10.99]I can't even move!
[65:14.39]What the fuck?!
[65:30.91]Throw in the towel?
[65:31.59]Not yet.
[65:40.76]That wasn't even a perfect block.
[65:41.62]She was guarding the whole time.
[65:45.93]I'm going to lose.
[65:51.72]Whatever.
[65:55.96]I also need to upgrade the character.
[65:57.34]I'm a rookie.
[65:57.94]I'm not going to be able to beat this.
[66:10.75]She tried to- she has a headbutt.
[66:20.83]I hate this stupid fucking game.
[66:27.37]How do you do the hooks?
[66:28.11]I don't know, man.
[66:28.83]It's like- it's the old left stick and right stick.
[66:32.51]And I can't walk.
[66:33.61]There's no walk.
[66:36.25]That's what's freaking me out.
[66:37.07]There's no move.
[66:40.96]I'm going for Hail Mary here.
[66:50.17]I'm going to build the meter the whole way and punch her three times in the face as hard as I can.
[67:04.22]Here we go.
[67:25.86]I'm sweating in here.
[67:26.88]Can I just tell you?
[67:31.32]Oh my god, I want to do that to you.
[67:33.26]Let me punch you.
[67:34.10]Jesus Christ, what happened?
[67:40.87]Oh, get up.
[67:41.23]Oh, that would've been so funny.
[67:50.94]Damn it.
[67:53.10]That's it.
[67:54.36]I lose.
[67:56.04]whatever he was too fast he moved way too quickly
[68:22.30]This game's fun.
[68:23.02]Alright, tennis.
[68:24.88]I can buy some more stuff.
[68:26.76]Sport climbing.
[68:28.36]Judo?
[68:29.08]Oh, I gotta play Judo.
[68:31.05]In the full knight outfit.
[68:32.17]You know what I mean?
[68:33.77]Or in the astronaut outfit.
[68:44.48]Oh shit, I didn't pick the outfit.
[68:47.20]Let's go back.
[68:50.51]Hold on, this looks really, really fun.
[68:52.65]I want to pick the right outfit.
[69:00.22]Okay.
[69:04.52]What should I have for Judo?
[69:08.14]Okay, 3,000 points.
[69:08.64]It's currently Sonic.
[69:20.29]The astronaut.
[69:27.65]Oh, I just did a suit.
[69:29.53]I like that.
[69:30.12]Yeah.
[69:32.20]Suit and like a nice hat.
[69:37.94]Swimming helmet.
[69:50.35]Alright, that's good.
[69:59.18]Alright, judo.
[70:01.86]This looks complicated, but I'm willing to give it a try.
[70:03.84]This looks like somebody from My Hero Academia.
[70:14.68]Kind of, yeah.
[70:20.40]Wait, I don't know how to play.
[70:21.94]Oh shit, I don't know how to play.
[70:23.54]I skipped all the tutorials.
[70:26.38]Um... What is it?
[70:34.17]What happened?
[70:50.77]I'm tapping A so fucking fast.
[70:52.95]What the hell?
[70:59.43]A. Dude, I'm tapping A so fast, it's not even funny.
[71:09.66]What's going on?
[71:14.28]You're tapping too fast.
[71:15.18]Come on, my stamina is going down.
[71:22.91]How do I get stamina back?
[71:34.74]We're not even doing anything.
[71:46.35]This is not you playing.
[71:47.57]Yes, it is.
[71:50.71]How do I read the rules?
[71:51.61]Okay, here we go.
[71:51.99]How to play.
[71:53.15]To grab your opponent's collar, press A. This has a shorter reach but will leave you less vulnerable to your opponent.
[71:57.63]Okay, sure.
[71:58.63]That's A grab.
[72:00.33]Press A rapidly after grabbing your opponent to push the white line along the action gauge.
[72:06.12]Stop at the red area for Ippon and the blue area for Waza-Ari.
[72:11.26]I was tapping A really fast.
[72:15.82]Inputting rapidly will cause the stamina to decrease.
[72:18.08]The movement of the line will become slower.
[72:21.70]Okay.
[72:21.92]Alright, so I just, maybe I ran out of, maybe I was going too fast.
[72:28.52]I went too far.
[72:29.24]Oh, okay.
[72:29.74]Alright, let's go.
[72:35.97]Nope.
[72:51.15]the fuck just happened?
[72:54.86]No!
[72:55.32]God damn it, I had it.
[72:56.18]This is weird.
[73:04.08]This is really odd.
[73:06.12]Like, she pushes back.
[73:07.47]Got it!
[73:22.62]I knocked her down.
[73:23.16]I should win.
[73:23.58]Okay.
[73:36.87]Here's the weird guy.
[73:38.21]This does look modded.
[73:44.78]This looks like a mod.
[73:47.12]Alright, let's go for it.
[73:55.13]I'm going for the collar grab.
[74:03.67]Push back!
[74:14.65]Shit.
[74:15.17]Reverse it!
[74:19.62]Wait, what?
[74:20.00]That's not me reversing it?
[74:22.52]I thought I was reversing that.
[74:24.17]I thought that was me reversing because I was tapping A. And it was him over on her side.
[74:30.51]What the fuck?
[74:31.33]Got him.
[74:58.69]NO!
[74:59.19]Fuck, I thought he was gonna go faster.
[75:00.33]Alright, I get it now.
[75:01.07]I, like, get it.
[75:01.65]Guys, I've never played Judo before.
[75:05.23]I don't know what the rules of Judo are.
[75:07.93]I've never played this game.
[75:08.89]Like, I don't even know what's going on.
[75:21.14]Rugby?
[75:21.69]This actual rugby?
[75:44.02]BMX, that one's gonna be fun.
[75:46.06]Alright.
[75:47.26]Hammer throw, I want the full armor set.
[75:49.83]Good.
[75:50.73]I just want to hear the sounds.
[76:11.88]The sounds are so funny.
[76:16.16]Hammer throw, is it?
[76:16.76]You can copy and paste outfits.
[76:25.52]I should probably do that.
[76:26.15]Hold left bumper and right bumper to grab the hammer.
[76:31.67]Oh, boy.
[76:34.25]While holding left bumper and right bumper, use R to rotate your body.
[76:38.62]Don't let go of the bumpers yet.
[76:42.04]While you're in slow motion, release the bumpers when the hammer overlaps the pink for a perfect throw.
[76:47.60]Let's try it.
[77:00.65]Okay.
[77:04.71]And then, how do you, how are you supposed to rotate while holding the bumpers?
[77:13.15]way this is weird okay you have to hold the bumpers and spin the right stick that's really hard to do this is actually hard to do this without letting go of the bumpers this is awful this is horrible
[77:42.44]Grab an Xbox controller right now, hold down left bumper and right bumper, and spin the right stick as fast as you can.
[77:49.72]It's like, what the fuck?
[77:50.78]You can't even do that.
[77:53.53]If it was left trigger and right trigger, maybe, but it's weird to do that.
[77:56.57]There it is.
[78:11.92]Perfect.
[78:39.13]I guess we're going again.
[78:39.81]Alright, let me try this again.
[78:45.61]Left bumper, right bumper.
[78:47.03]I must want to do it with... hold left bumper with my thumb, right bumper with my, like, index finger, and then hold it into my chest and spin it.
[78:54.35]I think that's what I'm going to do.
[78:58.07]My left hand is doing both bumpers.
[78:59.89]My right hand is only doing the stick.
[79:02.11]First try.
[79:19.70]That's gonna be really far.
[79:20.57]I was going the wrong way?
[79:24.79]What?
[79:27.00]Second try.
[79:49.93]That's pretty good.
[79:55.47]Is that a goofy yell?
[80:01.48]Alright, come on.
[80:02.06]I can do 80.
[80:02.48]I think I'm gonna piss my pants.
[80:05.22]I think I'm gonna pee.
[80:14.65]I'm like peeing.
[80:15.69]A little.
[80:32.29]Let's go to the gold medal.
[80:35.33]There's definitely a better way I can do this.
[80:36.63]How can I spin this so fucking fast?
[80:41.05]With my feet?
[80:43.40]I wonder if I can use my heel and just like... Let me see.
[80:48.88]How would I...
[80:53.63]How do I spin this insanely fast?
[81:00.21]I don't know.
[81:00.65]I think the way I'm doing it's the best way.
[81:10.54]Use a drill?
[81:11.14]Oh, fuck.
[81:15.06]Hold on.
[81:26.44]Ah!
[81:26.68]Shit.
[81:33.64]That's not good enough.
[81:34.50]That's not good enough.
[81:35.08]It's gotta be perfect.
[81:48.37]Perfect!
[81:56.76]Holy shit, I win.
[82:05.99]What?
[82:06.33]I didn't win.
[82:06.95]This guy's still 84?
[82:07.89]Okay, I gotta get it.
[82:28.62]Damn it.
[82:28.96]If that was perfect, that would have been like 90.
[82:34.68]I still qualify.
[82:35.32]That's fine.
[82:49.94]Oh, no.
[82:50.30]I can win.
[82:50.70]I can beat that.
[82:52.62]I'm doing this one again.
[82:57.80]I can absolutely beat that.
[83:12.67]I don't have to go crazy here.
[83:28.14]Okay, that's gonna be like a hundred.
[83:35.91]Hold.
[83:40.19]Somebody check that guy for a cannon.
[83:43.63]Somebody check that guy for a cannon, because there's no way you do that without a weapon, like a projectile weapon.
[84:07.47]See, I'm gonna get a hundred... I'm gonna break every world record and then I'm not gonna be able to do this for the last... Heat.
[84:17.78]Guy looks like a Zelda NPC.
[84:18.94]Final try!
[84:22.36]He kind of does.
[84:24.42]Amazing balance!
[84:33.85]Great!
[84:42.32]I gotta get a perfect.
[84:43.72]One of the three tries, there is no way I win.
[84:51.50]Yeah, once I qualify, I don't even have to... Yeah, but it's good practice, though.
[85:10.34]Change the graphic settings through my data on the main menu so it stops looking like a Wii game?
[85:14.58]I mean, here's the problem.
[85:18.94]I can't even capture this game.
[85:26.83]OP?
[85:28.31]I mean, I gotta pee in a minute.
[85:40.37]There it is.
[85:41.57]That's over 100.
[85:41.99]Now I can literally just... I can lift the ball up and let it go.
[85:46.27]I'm going to see if I can get one.
[85:53.64]Let's see if I can get one foot.
[85:55.00]Good!
[85:55.10]Yeah!
[86:11.81]Somehow that was kind of close to my other ones.
[86:19.33]What if I just don't spin at all?
[86:40.98]Throw it into the audience?
[86:42.11]You can't do that.
[86:42.77]Okay, now this one's really important.
[86:45.91]I have to win.
[86:47.87]Okay.
[87:01.22]What am I up against?
[87:02.24]83.
[87:02.26]I can do that.
[87:10.44]Just one of these has to be really good.
[87:11.48]That's it.
[87:23.17]See you later.
[87:24.29]I'll take the gold medal, please.
[87:33.56]Now I'm just trying to get a better record.
[87:34.70]How did I get 107 that time?
[87:55.08]Perfect throw.
[87:56.28]He said fantastic last time, not perfect.
[88:03.61]How was that one worse?
[88:04.35]Ah, whatever.
[88:23.87]I win.
[88:24.51]It's okay.
[88:30.83]Take a gold.
[88:44.60]Why does everybody look so young?
[88:59.21]Oh shit.
[89:02.07]6,000 points.
[89:02.39]Beach volleyball?
[89:07.17]I'm going to be terrible at this, but I want to play tennis though.
[89:12.63]We need a new outfit for tennis.
[89:14.74]Oh my god, somebody just... Easy cache.
[89:17.90]Let's get 50 community subs.
[89:19.40]What on Earth are you doing?
[89:23.36]50 community subs.
[89:28.44]Jesus.
[89:30.28]Thanks a lot.
[89:38.14]I got something cool for tennis.
[89:43.84]Wario?
[89:47.38]Woody?
[89:59.88]I kind of like this one.
[90:04.93]Caveman suit's pretty good too.
[90:07.35]Bloodborne outfit?
[90:08.41]This one?
[90:11.15]Could this be the big cat thing?
[90:16.68]Is that 10,000 points?
[90:23.44]Wrestler?
[90:23.90]I'm gonna be the wrestler.
[90:34.21]Hmm.
[90:59.95]I like this.
[91:03.25]Yeah, but it has to be this though.
[91:04.47]I'm doing this one.
[91:05.69]Let's go.
[91:07.67]Perfect tennis outfit.
[91:13.77]Oh wait, hold on a minute.
[91:14.47]Somebody said to make it look better.
[91:18.53]Settings.
[91:23.08]Graphics.
[91:24.76]Yeah, like, what the fuck?
[91:26.52]Why is it doing that?
[91:27.98]Why was it 1080?
[91:32.51]What the fuck?
[91:33.83]Why is this all off?
[91:38.77]I don't understand why this is off.
[91:45.20]Are you kidding me?
[91:49.80]Jesus.
[91:52.23]Confirm.
[91:53.01]Alright, yes.
[91:53.77]Apply the changes.
[91:54.60]Look, it looks so much better.
[91:55.90]Fucking god.
[92:08.10]Why?
[92:08.70]Why?
[92:09.08]Why would you ever make it like that?
[92:11.09]L moves.
[92:19.47]A swings the racket.
[92:22.05]Returning a ball, you can input earlier to build up power.
[92:24.36]Yep.
[92:25.72]Special is L, B, and A when you have a full gauge.
[92:28.56]Okay, let's go.
[92:37.54]This actually kind of looks worse.
[92:38.52]Start.
[92:55.31]How's this guy still in it?
[93:05.89]Hit it away from him.
[93:07.55]Okay.
[93:12.18]Oh, what do we got here?
[93:12.96]We got... Big head tennis.
[93:14.60]Okay, I got it.
[93:26.04]This guy's having a lot of trouble.
[93:46.89]Oh no no no no!
[93:52.75]This is it.
[93:54.37]Goodbye.
[94:03.55]Who came up with this game's scoring system?
[94:08.19]Hold on a second.
[94:16.09]What, 15 points?
[94:16.95]I don't know, man.
[94:19.61]Look at football.
[94:20.63]American football.
[94:22.33]Six points for a touchdown.
[94:23.89]One point if you kick a ball through the hole.
[94:26.21]Three if you kick a ball through the hole before you throw the ball into the end zone.
[94:30.39]All sports are weird.
[94:32.94]I think baseball and soccer are pretty normal, right?
[94:39.40]Isn't rugby like that too?
[94:40.40]I actually kind of like this a lot.
[94:49.74]What do you mean baseball is not normal?
[94:51.08]If somebody touches home plate, it's one point.
[94:54.33]It's as basic as you can get.
[94:55.47]Same with soccer.
[94:57.57]If the ball goes in the net, it's one point.
[95:07.23]Like, if you get a base hit and somebody scores, it's not like eight runs.
[95:16.73]Whatever.
[95:22.64]Golf is the most normal?
[95:23.78]Well, golf is like reverse.
[95:30.29]It's strokes, right?
[95:31.37]And you have to get the ball in the hole.
[95:32.75]But if you do like four strokes, it's worse.
[95:36.19]You don't want runs.
[95:37.55]You just want to get the ball in the hole with one attempt.
[95:43.30]You don't want points.
[95:44.02]That guy in the face.
[95:57.65]That kid should have rocked his head back.
[96:01.02]Look at this, I hit this dude right in the fucking mouth.
[96:07.45]Give me a better angle.
[96:16.45]You killed that ball boy.
[96:17.83]Thinking of the new Mario Golf?
[96:24.85]It looks kind of fun.
[96:25.60]Although, I don't know, maybe.
[96:32.37]Alright, it's gonna get harder.
[96:41.43]What was that sound?
[96:42.17]Did this guy just squeeze out one?
[96:44.79]Did you hear that?
[96:46.40]What was that?
[96:51.58]Am I hearing things, or did that guy actually just do that?
[96:55.68]Okay.
[97:10.90]It's supposed to be his pants, I think.
[97:12.26]It's supposed to be his jeans rubbing together, whatever it is.
[97:19.85]No!
[97:20.27]Shit, I queued up way too early.
[97:21.41]That was an amazing return.
[97:23.49]You scored a point.
[97:26.25]I missed.
[97:37.43]Do it!
[97:41.55]I got it.
[97:41.81]Should I wait a little longer?
[97:52.01]I feel like I should be.
[97:53.83]What happened to the ball?
[98:06.06]It stopped.
[98:11.52]Come on, he's so close to the net.
[98:13.74]Yeah, I was going to say.
[98:20.64]OP?
[98:21.00]I can hit the serve way harder.
[98:28.93]We both have power moves, so... Sorry, I got...
[98:45.44]Alright, I'm good.
[98:46.42]You've been holding your piss for a long time.
[98:50.80]Yeah, I know.
[98:55.73]I'll be fine.
[99:05.86]Go to the bathroom.
[99:06.54]I will, just wait.
[99:16.80]Didn't even do it.
[99:18.24]You thought you were going to get me with that one?
[99:19.36]Nope.
[99:20.27]Are you fucking kidding me?
[99:21.31]You got me with that one.
[99:22.75]Of all the ones to get.
[99:23.43]See ya.
[99:35.43]Alright, game match.
[99:39.58]Then we're going for the gold medal.
[99:44.59]Use the power?
[99:45.39]I'm gonna use it when I need it.
[99:46.24]Like right now.
[99:47.40]It's over.
[100:03.37]Play the BMX one?
[100:04.35]Yeah, we will.
[100:04.77]I mean, I gotta get, um... I gotta get the gold medal for tennis.
[100:10.49]I love tennis.
[100:12.69]I love playing tennis video games, I hate playing the actual sport.
[100:24.97]It's so hard to actually play tennis.
[100:29.57]Anytime I've ever played tennis with anybody, we do a little volley and then somebody just hits it and it soars out of the entire arena.
[100:36.82]It's just like, okay, well now what?
[100:39.50]Somebody has to go get that.
[100:42.68]And never get it down.
[100:43.38]Nope.
[100:49.70]Did he fall down?
[100:56.03]I'm just on the run with this guy.
[100:57.37]This dude hasn't fucking moved.
[101:03.68]Shit!
[101:04.60]Alright, I gotta get up.
[101:25.95]No!
[101:26.87]Whatever.
[101:29.99]I thought he was going over to the middle.
[101:40.78]These are bad returns.
[101:47.42]He's on the run.
[101:48.00]Keep him on the run.
[101:49.32]Through his legs?
[101:54.58]Nice.
[102:03.10]He's hitting the ball weird.
[102:04.06]He's doing like top spin and bottom spin and all that shit.
[102:07.33]I only know how to hit the ball normally.
[102:08.63]Alright, I'm still gonna win.
[102:20.63]The fuck?
[102:23.47]What was that?
[102:34.36]I'm going to say this guy's name.
[102:35.30]Send his name backwards and send it to his own dimensions.
[102:37.93]Whatever.
[102:47.11]That's bad.
[102:49.21]Whatever.
[102:49.51]He can take it.
[102:49.91]That was a really good serve.
[103:00.62]Had to do it.
[103:10.69]Oh, he did the thing.
[103:11.79]Shit.
[103:14.03]Run hard?
[103:14.63]How do I do that?
[103:21.82]You're in trouble now.
[103:26.56]Do a lob?
[103:27.14]I don't think I even can.
[103:28.08]I think I have to unlock the tip to do it.
[103:41.23]Did I get points?
[103:45.05]Why did I get points?
[103:59.28]Oh shit, oh shit.
[104:04.56]He's so close to the net, how do I do the lob?
[104:11.16]How do I do the lob shot?
[104:12.58]Tell me how to play the fucking game.
[104:14.44]Is it Y?
[104:16.78]Okay.
[104:16.88]There it is.
[104:26.53]I get that one.
[104:26.99]Alright, deuce.
[104:29.83]Not deuce.
[104:31.30]Deuce.
[104:33.88]Let's win it right here.
[104:50.46]He has a special, I'm terrified of it.
[104:56.18]Oh, get the fuck out of here.
[104:59.92]I'm in trouble now.
[105:11.89]You're not gonna catch that one!
[105:20.75]Did he lose his special?
[105:21.83]No, he still got it.
[105:29.81]What the fuck?
[105:32.30]What's the law button?
[105:36.32]Why?
[105:36.84]Fuck.
[105:40.78]Settle down.
[105:41.22]I'm fine.
[105:41.82]I gotta settle down.
[105:50.79]What are you doing?
[105:51.63]I'm trying to hit the ball.
[105:53.08]What the hell was that?
[105:54.06]That was so stupid.
[106:04.90]I hate this.
[106:16.10]Why?
[106:17.18]I was trying to hold down A and he slapped at it.
[106:48.79]I was gonna do the same thing to you!
[106:54.51]Jesus.
[107:11.34]Come on, don't let him win.
[107:14.24]I gotta run this all the way back.
[107:23.47]Why?
[107:26.03]Why?
[107:27.83]It's like so slow.
[107:29.47]I wasn't trying to do that.
[107:31.91]He's like, I'm gonna swing.
[107:34.97]Now I'll swing.
[107:38.80]Oh my God.
[107:39.86]Fuck off.
[107:40.66]Dumb game.
[107:47.14]I've
[107:56.55]It's like, that's not even fair.
[107:57.89]That guy's so slow and sloppy.
[108:02.20]Yeah, eat shit.
[108:19.63]Eat shit.
[108:31.52]Is that implying that I was just about to fall over?
[108:33.14]Alright.
[108:39.19]Let's bring it all the way back.
[108:49.18]Bring it all the way back.
[108:49.88]Time to win the game.
[108:50.82]Let's go.
[109:02.55]Yes!
[109:05.39]What was that?
[109:05.98]2-2?
[109:12.64]Okay, 2-2.
[109:13.04]This is it.
[109:16.43]X for topspin?
[109:32.08]Getting a little too high up, aren't you?
[109:34.38]Fuck me.
[109:39.30]He's got a power move too.
[109:49.12]Good.
[109:50.78]One to one?
[109:51.36]Wait, how does this work?
[110:01.05]He wasn't ready!
[110:04.39]Two to one.
[110:06.34]The first to seven?
[110:07.32]Oh shit, really?
[110:15.68]On the run, on the run, on the run.
[110:16.90]That's a point right there.
[110:34.92]Fuck!
[110:35.56]I just, like, served it up for him.
[110:36.93]Alright, it's alright.
[110:37.63]We both have specials.
[110:49.00]Goodbye.
[110:49.34]That wasn't a waste?
[110:57.32]No, it was.
[110:57.86]It's alright, though.
[111:04.78]Give me a fucking break.
[111:05.56]I pressed A. I pressed A. I did it perfectly.
[111:09.67]That's just... Alright, whatever.
[111:18.38]Even game.
[111:18.70]Let's go.
[111:39.31]Ooh, whoopsie!
[111:58.60]Bad play on your part, dude.
[112:00.84]One more point and I win.
[112:12.23]Oh, fuck you.
[112:16.91]I got it right here.
[112:17.51]I got it right here.
[112:17.97]He's done.
[112:18.25]Yay!
[112:37.58]My ticket just broke my chair.
[112:38.94]My chair's broken, I think.
[112:46.02]I think it is.
[112:46.42]The back is all messed up.
[112:54.62]That was fun.
[112:57.98]That was really fun.
[112:58.58]Alright, somebody said BMX.
[113:05.17]Okay, we got it. 2400?
[113:15.58]Go pee?
[113:15.96]Alright, I'll go pee.
[113:16.57]I'll be right back.
[116:25.52]Alright, hello.
[116:37.67]Let's come back.
[116:41.53]Alright, so... BMX is what people wanted to see, right?
[116:46.19]That actually looks really fun.
[116:48.77]Hold on.
[116:50.21]BMX outfit?
[116:57.26]Let's see, what can I afford new stuff?
[117:08.85]BMX.
[117:11.29]I have to have a funny outfit for everything, right?
[117:16.76]Caveman?
[117:32.12]Am I not gonna wear a helmet?
[117:33.02]That seems kind of unsafe.
[117:39.14]This guy has wicked funny outfits.
[117:45.39]Cursor.
[117:46.15]I got you.
[117:46.47]Okay, uh... BMX.
[118:00.51]Alright.
[118:01.23]Press A as soon as you see go to start.
[118:05.13]A rapidly to dash, but be careful.
[118:07.24]Doing so will make it harder to turn.
[118:09.80]You'll reach your maximum speed when the blue gauge reaches the yellow line.
[118:13.04]Press X to jump.
[118:16.40]Try to jump at the red arrows in the course to perform a trick.
[118:19.06]Alright, let's go.
[118:32.85]Another clown.
[118:36.13]But don't... Don't tap A too fast.
[118:56.57]Why am I not doing a good, cool jump?
[118:58.13]That was first place.
[119:06.69]Shit What the fuck was that you guys remember Dave Mira BMX That game was insane you used to be you could bail off the bike and you just ragdoll into cars and stuff that game was fucking hilarious
[119:42.15]I have to lap everybody?
[119:43.11]That was close.
[120:13.85]uh it's too bad he can't fall off the bike you're gonna get rolled in the finals well whatever I at least I'll probably place still king of retail it shouldn't be
[120:55.03]I was just seeing if I could run into anybody.
[120:59.42]The game gets louder.
[121:00.26]The game's loud.
[121:14.14]Shit!
[121:14.58]Let me do that too!
[121:16.98]Fuck!
[121:17.26]Alright, I don't want to lose.

[122:09.07]Um... No, I mean, not really.
[122:10.79]We're just playing Olympic games.
[122:13.53]I played this retail game that I wasn't really any good at.
[122:17.05]We decided to play this.
[122:17.83]Alright, these are finals.
[122:20.17]I gotta be... Alright, I don't want to screw this up.
[122:34.73]I'm really curious about the climbing one.
[122:36.99]The sport climbing.
[122:43.05]Okay, here we go.
[122:43.55]Oh, what the fuck?
[122:45.00]Shit!

[123:51.99]Riders ready?
[123:53.01]Watch the gate.
[123:56.23]OK, we're good.
[124:19.35]Oh my god, why?
[124:20.41]We can't all do this at the same fucking time!
[124:57.56]Oh, my arm is killing me.
[125:06.02]No!
[125:06.90]Don't let it pass me.
[125:09.06]Okay.
[125:09.42]I got whatever.
[125:09.94]New record.
[125:21.97]Okay, riders.
[125:23.15]Random start.
[125:24.51]Riders ready?
[125:25.55]Watch the gate.
[125:30.66]One more try.
[125:31.24]One more retry.
[125:34.88]I swear to God.
[125:36.58]When he says watch the gate.
[125:49.91]Why the fuck am I going so slow?
[125:52.19]What the fuck?
[125:57.70]Stop jumping.
[125:58.42]I don't even... I didn't...
[126:20.99]What's the point of even doing that one?
[126:23.25]This guy was floating.
[126:32.31]Why do I lose speed there?
[126:34.03]What the fuck is doing that?
[126:35.43]Okay, riders.
[126:40.80]Random start.
[126:41.64]Riders ready?
[126:43.22]Watch the gate.
[126:48.18]I fucking hate this game What the fuck
[127:18.37]What the fuck is going on?
[127:19.85]A bit early.
[127:20.61]What are you talking about?
[127:42.85]You fucking piece of shit.
[127:44.33]I swear to God.
[127:45.07]You knocked me out of the way.
[127:51.66]I'm only doing this one more time.
[127:55.62]This is it.
[128:05.19]How are they doing that?
[128:05.92]You see when they lean down?
[128:08.34]They lean down and they get extra speed.
[128:09.82]How are they doing that?
[128:22.54]Why?
[128:37.19]On the fucking puddle!
[128:39.85]Slow down!
[128:40.39]Settle down!
[128:42.24]No!
[128:52.93]God dammit, how are they doing that?
[128:54.61]I don't even understand how they're doing that move.
[128:59.87]What?
[129:00.23]What are they doing?
[129:01.07]Why are they going... How are they doing that?
[129:07.54]It's Y. How to play.
[129:10.50]Oh, sorry.
[129:11.42]Skip that.
[129:12.16]Sorry, I forgot.
[129:13.76]The tutorial is hidden behind unlocking the tutorial.
[129:19.44]What a bonehead move that was.
[129:25.60]Okay, riders, random start.
[129:28.11]Riders ready?
[129:29.13]Watch the gate.
[129:59.45]When you go downhill, lean down.
[130:01.07]I don't even know how to do that.
[130:10.48]Lean down?
[130:22.49]I'm trying to lean down.
[130:23.63]How do I lean down?
[130:25.98]This is the stupidest fucking thing ever.
[130:27.38]Holy shit.
[130:30.25]Now, just give me the tutorial how to play the game.
[130:33.11]Just tell me how to play the game.
[130:34.43]I don't know.
[130:35.67]Why is it hidden?
[130:36.93]Why is it hidden?
[130:38.41]Why?
[130:39.80]That's insanity.
[131:01.25]Push, wheelie, super boost, overtake left, overtake right?
[131:09.26]Push?
[131:16.36]Oh, fuck that one.
[131:17.00]That one sucks.
[131:23.75]Remember, you sound like my dad when he yells at me.
[131:28.96]I don't know why they hide everything, but, like, just tell me how to play.
[131:33.20]Oh, by the way, if you press Y, it's an extra super grab.
[131:36.53]But, you know, you'll fucking unlock that in, like, an hour.
[131:38.89]This is going to be hell.
[131:49.92]I already know it.
[132:02.78]Okay, after a certain speed, you'll be able to grab the orange holds that are further ahead.
[132:06.14]Press and hold the keys in the opposite direction of the hold boost.
[132:11.48]Oh god, I'm gonna fuck this up a hundred times.
[132:13.08]Oh, whatever.
[132:15.83]I'm just gonna try it.
[132:16.43]Whatever.
[132:19.91]There's a lot of people here.
[132:28.13]So it's left and right analog.
[132:52.65]I should be able to... What the fuck was that?
[133:02.40]somebody was somebody was pulling me up I I greased the guy up top that had the harness on me he was like reeling me in like a fishing reel I gave that guy a 20. are you kidding me like watch this this is not possible unless somebody's pulling me
[133:35.43]That's it?
[133:40.53]Let's see if I can do that again.
[133:52.78]Ready?
[133:56.58]Go!
[134:09.89]9.5.
[134:10.01]Alright, I can do more than that.
[134:12.63]I can do better than that.
[134:18.66]I think I can do like 9 or 8.
[134:21.20]If I get the boost in the beginning, I'll be able to get it.
[134:40.23]Can't fall?
[134:40.77]I don't think so.
[134:42.53]I gotta get the boost.
[134:53.62]Ready?
[134:54.04]Go!
[135:09.61]9.3.
[135:09.73]That's pretty good.
[135:12.72]Can I get it to under 9?
[135:22.97]Alright, let me try to get it to under 9.
[135:25.51]I like this one.
[135:26.91]Is this practice mode?
[135:28.53]Oh.
[135:30.25]Well, I'm gonna destroy everybody.
[135:31.71]I have the secret.
[135:58.72]Shit, 10, whatever.
[135:59.40]Alright, I'll smoke the competition, it doesn't matter.
[136:12.51]Alright, let's do Olympic Games.
[136:19.47]You'll go faster if you just do it right.
[136:21.75]Really?
[136:21.99]You sure?
[136:29.47]I feel like nine seconds is impossible.
[136:32.21]13.1 record.
[136:41.13]Oh my God.
[136:41.75]I just, I'm so sorry, everybody.
[136:44.46]Just punched the microphone accidentally.
[136:46.60]I'm so sorry.
[137:12.45]Whatever.
[137:23.74]5.2 is the real world record.
[137:25.40]Are you kidding me?
[137:43.56]You watch it, now it's real.
[137:45.72]Sport climbing, 5 seconds.
[137:47.80]No way.
[137:49.74]Oh shit, this guy's 9.5.
[137:53.16]What?
[137:53.60]I thought this was a cartoon joke thing.
[137:55.28]People can actually do that?
[138:00.24]That's unbelievable.
[138:03.01]What?
[138:22.73]5.2 Watch it on YouTube Well, all tabbing is gonna be a huge pain in the ass
[138:40.21]Watch the record.
[138:40.79]Alright, well, I'll watch it before I turn the stream off.
[138:42.81]No, I'm not ending the stream.
[138:44.29]So just everyone that... Oh, he's ending.
[138:45.75]No, no.
[138:48.37]I want to do the one on the left.
[138:49.27]That one looks really fun.
[138:50.03]7.5.
[138:50.05]Oh, I'm going to get destroyed here.
[138:57.81]Alright, let me try to do this actually.
[139:00.54]I'm going to do bursts and then I'm going to skip.
[139:03.92]See if I can actually do this.
[139:18.70]I don't get it.
[139:23.65]She fucking fell down?
[139:24.33]Oh no, I lost.
[139:25.77]I don't know, whatever.
[139:27.11]I was trying to grab the second one above it.
[139:30.03]I was trying to do it.
[139:30.65]I wouldn't do it.
[139:31.05]Because you can skip them, right?
[139:37.69]I was trying just to aim up at it, but I couldn't do it.
[139:40.43]You have to do both sticks.
[139:41.64]Oh, whatever.
[139:55.51]table tennis I feel like I'm gonna freak out at this and get really angry well we have to do it once do rugby I don't know I don't even know the rules of rugby I'll be honest table tennis
[140:31.60]It's like American football with less rules.
[140:35.30]That actually kind of sounds awesome.
[140:40.40]Oh god, it's analog aiming.
[140:42.38]Great.
[140:42.75]This is going to be fun.
[140:43.65]I feel like I'm going to be obnoxiously huge on the screen.
[141:00.36]I'm gonna say something.
[141:12.17]I think table tennis is probably the hardest thing a human being can do.
[141:17.87]To be this good at table tennis and do the crazy shit these guys do, I think it's the most intense, most skill-based thing that you can do as a human being.
[141:34.96]And look, look, look.
[141:36.20]I'm not talking about you and your buddy are out at the bar playing for 10 minutes with your drinks down.
[141:41.41]No, I'm talking about the competitive, best-in-class tabletop players.
[141:47.09]It's absurd.
[141:48.35]It's not even possible.
[141:50.88]Humans can't do that.
[141:52.12]But they do.
[142:06.35]Shit.
[142:12.73]This is the worst character to play here.
[142:23.74]Being a streamer seems harder.
[142:29.00]Um, I can assure you it isn't.
[142:52.38]Well, that depends.
[142:53.26]That depends.
[142:53.60]That depends.
[142:54.90]That depends.
[142:55.96]Right?
[142:58.64]Like, it depends on what you mean by, like, a streamer.
[143:00.05]Because I could stream myself playing table tennis.
[143:04.81]And I'm a tabletop table tennis player.
[143:07.09]And I'm a streamer, too.
[143:08.61]That's double skill.
[143:17.47]So, I mean, it depends how much effort you put in, right?
[143:22.48]If I stream myself doing surgery and I'm a top surgeon in the field, I'm still a streamer and I look up and I like wink every time like 10 subs comes in.
[143:29.46]I'm still a streamer, right?
[143:31.54]It really depends on what you're doing.
[143:53.29]No other human could do the Bugleberry stream.
[143:58.86]I mean, that's not completely accurate.
[144:04.24]I can't fucking wait.
[144:05.34]I can't wait.
[144:07.40]This summer is gonna be so goddamn fun.
[144:09.50]Like, you have no idea how excited I am.
[144:15.26]I said it before, but I'll just say it again.
[144:16.72]I'm not going to leak anything because I'm not doing that.
[144:19.16]I wanted to be cool and surprising.
[144:24.64]The couple of things that are going to happen this summer, there's two huge fucking streams that are going to happen this summer.
[144:30.82]Both of them are potentially five times bigger than the carnival.
[144:37.07]Five to ten times bigger.
[144:40.25]So, it's just, I can't wait.
[144:42.43]I wish I could just tell you what it is.
[144:44.55]I wish I could.
[144:46.40]You'll know soon enough.
[144:47.08]Bigger than archaeology?
[144:52.34]Five times bigger than the archaeology stream.
[144:58.58]Biggest thing I've ever done, without a doubt.
[145:00.78]It's going to be really hard to do something else that's more elaborate, if I'm honest.
[145:11.95]The guy has a special move.
[145:12.88]Do it!
[145:16.12]Damn it.
[145:24.94]Swing!
[145:25.32]Fuuuuck!
[145:28.29]Fuck.
[145:43.97]See, this shit is too hard.
[145:48.56]We know the big stream is baseball.
[145:50.88]That's one of them.
[145:52.90]We're talking about one of two.
[145:56.24]Second one is bigger than the baseball stream.
[145:58.84]Like, it's the biggest thing I've ever done.
[146:00.08]Without a doubt.
[146:03.84]And the baseball stream is gonna be probably my favorite stream ever.
[146:06.30]I needed to make that clear.
[146:12.35]I can't wait.
[146:13.79]I've been just dreaming of doing that for so long.
[146:16.95]It was supposed to happen last year.
[146:18.07]Oh my god, I can't wait.
[146:26.73]Match point!
[146:32.20]Special shot!
[146:42.32]Jesus!
[146:49.68]I got him on the ropes right here.
[146:50.52]Yes!
[146:52.57]Are you still going to do the 30 webcam screams?
[147:12.81]Yes.
[147:24.46]Why is ping pong a summer sport?
[147:27.00]Um... I don't know.
[147:30.40]I mean, it's kind of sporty, right?
[147:33.68]Kind of jumping around in shorts.
[147:38.43]Will either stream be pre-recorded?
[147:39.99]No.
[147:40.07]Both of them are going to be live completely.
[147:43.65]Live, live, live.
[147:52.75]When are these happening?
[147:56.17]August and September.
[147:59.42]One's going to happen in August and the other one's going to happen in September.
[148:01.60]I need to give you a hard date soon.
[148:09.43]Alright, this is the finals right here.
[148:14.04]But if you want to know, these have taken up a significant amount of time.
[148:22.14]There's a lot going into these two.
[148:25.52]But it's going to be worth it.
[148:37.57]Do nothing already.
[148:42.11]You said summer, you gave us fall months.
[148:45.00]August?
[148:48.28]Summer goes into September.
[148:51.90]Summer doesn't end in September.
[148:53.28]End of September, maybe.
[148:54.06]Wait, do you guys not know when fall starts?
[149:09.53]It's like September 23rd or 24th or something, isn't it?
[149:14.22]When's Equinox?
[149:15.92]It's like September 24th.
[149:23.96]Summer ends technically on September 21st.
[149:25.78]Yeah, what are you guys talking about?
[149:38.01]Holy shit, this guy is not even a person.
[149:39.57]He's a robot.
[149:42.23]Wow.
[149:42.55]I forgot you're in the Northern Hemisphere.
[149:55.30]Oh yeah, that makes sense.
[149:57.54]That would make sense considering that's like winter, right?
[150:01.22]For a lot of people.
[150:02.67]When is winter?
[150:03.25]For the other hemispheres.
[150:15.57]Right now?
[150:21.63]I gotta put this away and get the gold.
[150:25.88]Sorry, I'll get it right now.
[150:27.94]Sorry.
[150:33.22]Are they gonna be bigger than your giant dump truck ass?
[150:37.00]I would assume so, yes.
[150:45.08]Got it.
[150:47.10]Gold medal.
[150:48.40]Gold medal.
[150:50.56]Gold medal.
[150:59.70]You have the choice to not read those messages.
[151:02.47]I choose to.
[151:14.55]What about the Ludwig tweet?
[151:16.69]Yeah, I still want to do him.
[151:20.79]I mean, it's a huge laundry list of shit I have to do.
[151:25.53]He did say I could have a little bit of time.
[151:28.34]He did mention that.
[151:35.90]Alright, I only have a few more to do.
[151:37.08]I think I want to go back to do basketball also.
[151:43.45]I have no idea really how soccer works either.
[151:50.93]And I gotta be careful here.
[151:51.83]Because I don't want to talk shit about soccer.
[151:57.11]I feel like people would fucking murder me.
[152:00.35]I think it's cool.
[152:01.49]I just don't know the rules.
[152:03.35]Never got into it.
[152:08.41]Use A to pass.
[152:09.25]Hold for a long pass.
[152:12.90]X's shoot.
[152:13.38]The longer you hold, the ball will fly.
[152:16.12]Special shot.
[152:18.06]You guys remember Mega Man Soccer?
[152:21.70]That game was insane.
[152:34.61]I never got into soccer.
[152:41.13]It just never did it for me.
[152:42.53]It just didn't.
[152:44.25]I don't even know how you play.
[152:45.03]The only thing I know about soccer is if somebody, like, touches you, you have to do a WWF flop like you get hit with a chair.
[152:58.20]Pass it!
[152:59.38]Wait, that's not even... they're not a team.
[153:00.62]Is there a speed boost?
[153:08.40]How do I switch characters?
[153:22.17]Isn't that illegal?
[153:22.99]Is the slide tackling illegal?
[153:24.15]Holy shit, that was not good.
[153:39.79]I got it, I got it.
[153:40.27]Alright, I'm gonna pass it and have somebody bump it with their head.
[153:49.42]I should win it.
[153:51.10]Score some goals?
[153:51.98]That's not how it works.
[153:59.89]What?
[154:01.79]I got that.
[154:02.67]What are you talking about?
[154:10.87]Is that the graduation theme?
[154:18.30]It was graduation.
[154:33.17]What are you doing?
[154:34.09]You fucking idiot.
[154:35.91]What was that?
[154:40.71]What even happened?
[154:45.46]Oh yeah, they have to stand there and get hit in the face by the ball.
[154:47.32]I remember this part.
[154:51.16]Why have any corner?
[154:52.20]Why?
[154:52.44]What the fuck, man?
[154:55.56]I don't play.
[154:56.80]I don't like soccer.
[155:05.70]What if I don't want to pass?
[155:13.22]What was that?
[155:22.14]It's gonna be seven to one.
[155:23.22]It's not gonna be seven to one.
[155:39.59]That's like shot that person.
[155:45.35]Jeez.
[155:45.89]Okay.
[155:46.23]Well, I'm just gonna do that.
[155:58.95]I always found soccer to be so difficult, too.
[156:01.07]Like, man, you gotta kick and run with the ball, and somebody else can just come kick and take it from you.
[156:06.64]That sucks.
[156:11.51]It's so hard to control.
[156:23.93]It's like basketball.
[156:24.65]Yeah, but basketball, you get to use your hands in basketball.
[156:27.50]Using your legs and your feet is way harder.
[156:28.88]Because you can at least hold on to the ball.
[156:41.80]Oh shit!
[156:42.66]I got it!
[156:43.04]What about hockey?
[156:55.13]Yeah, hockey's like a combination of every sport that's difficult to play.
[156:58.07]They're just like, yeah, let's make it kind of like soccer and football, like you can beat the fuck out of each other.
[157:02.60]Oh yeah, by the way, you're on ice skates.
[157:05.30]I don't think the person that invented hockey thought anyone was going to think it was cool.
[157:07.80]It's like a game you invent in your backyard that's really difficult and hard and impossible to play.
[157:16.33]And then it's like, holy shit, wait, people are actually doing this.
[157:18.09]And they're like fucking really good.
[157:29.57]I will never understand.
[157:30.43]And look, I'm not against it.
[157:33.35]But why is hockey the only sport where you can punch the other guy in the face and not go to jail?
[157:40.38]Can you imagine if somebody was playing a soccer game like this and just gets into the person's face and they just start punching each other in the face?
[157:55.64]Just like assaulting each other.
[158:05.72]That's the best part.
[158:06.50]I'm not saying, oh, it needs to be taken out of the sport.
[158:08.86]I don't care.
[158:09.85]I always found it interesting.
[158:11.77]It's the only sport where you do that.
[158:17.49]I can't think of another sport that, look, people saying boxing, UFC, those sports are to beat each other up.
[158:25.12]Hockey is we skate around and get the puck into the goal, not punch each other in the face.
[158:40.13]You a Golden Knights fan?
[158:41.45]They almost made it.
[158:43.16]They almost got there.
[158:45.60]They almost made it to the Stanley Cup.
[158:56.78]Okay, for instance, if I were to spike the ball here, and get angry that I missed, and the person over there trash talked me, so I grabbed a handful of sand and threw it in their face and then punched them in the mouth.
[159:08.03]And the referees are like, okay, everybody, alright, just settle down.
[159:10.94]Okay, they're fighting.
[159:12.40]Everyone settle down.
[159:13.29]You're getting two minutes.
[159:15.25]That's kind of crazy.
[159:31.20]When this bench is clearing brawls and baseball, those guys all get fined like $100,000 and suspended.
[159:39.12]Does that happen in hockey?
[159:40.14]Do you get suspended?
[159:45.03]Start.
[160:00.63]You can, but it doesn't always happen.
[160:01.79]Alright.
[160:04.29]Serve it.
[160:04.57]Volleyball always seemed like so much fun.
[160:11.21]But I'm just going to hear.
[160:12.35]I'll give you the meme.
[160:13.13]I'll give you guys the joke.
[160:14.09]You're waiting to hear it.
[160:15.35]I'm just not tall enough to play it.
[160:16.30]I just can't get up to the net.
[160:18.46]I just can't.
[160:34.75]What was with the weird spin?
[160:35.81]That was crazy.
[160:36.33]Alright, set me.
[160:49.19]Volleyball hurts too.
[160:50.77]I got a lot of respect for people that play volleyball.
[160:54.22]Doesn't matter how soft the ball is coming over there.
[160:56.72]When you do the dig and it hits you in the wrist and in the arms, that shit hurts every time.
[161:02.64]Somebody's spiking the ball and you dig.
[161:04.54]That is painful.
[161:06.34]Every time.
[161:06.92]It's like Wolverine when he puts his claws out.
[161:08.99]Does that hurt?
[161:10.17]Every time.
[161:11.91]That was a terrible reference, but who cares?
[161:13.69]You're still here.
[161:14.55]You didn't click X. Nice receive.
[161:31.37]Did you get bruising?
[161:32.83]Do you bruise and shit when you play volleyball?
[161:35.25]I feel like a volleyball player would have just purple arms.
[161:38.52]Damn.
[161:47.54]Are you allowed to use wrist guards or no?
[161:51.31]Is that against the rules?
[161:51.99]Okay.
[162:02.69]Can I jump?
[162:03.35]Oh, I can.
[162:03.73]Alright.
[162:03.99]I used to play it a lot in gym and it hurt like hell.
[162:18.26]Stopped hurting after a while.
[162:19.22]I also feel like if you play all the time, you would get better at hitting it right in that spot that doesn't hurt.
[162:32.74]I just won.
[162:33.24]I wasn't even paying attention.
[162:43.53]It doesn't hurt if you're not a fucking wuss.
[162:50.80]Alright, yeah.
[162:51.90]And you're in a tank top, and sandals and shorts, and it's 10 degrees outside.
[162:56.48]And it's not cold though, right?
[162:59.12]It is.
[163:00.31]It hurts.
[163:01.05]And it sucks.
[163:01.91]You don't have to tell everybody that.
[163:03.55]You don't have to say like, what do you mean cold?
[163:05.69]You wuss.
[163:06.99]It's really cold.
[163:07.67]You fucking are suffering right now.
[163:09.25]Like, stop.
[163:12.99]I don't care.
[163:13.55]Like, nobody cares.
[163:14.15]Like, everybody knows it sucks.
[163:24.76]And Fahrenheit, not Celsius.
[163:27.89]That struck a nerve.
[163:41.34]Like if you slam your whole hand in a car door.
[163:44.14]And it's like, yeah!
[163:46.04]And then you go... Nah, it's fine.
[163:48.10]Doesn't hurt.
[163:49.62]Like, dude, you need to go to the hospital?
[163:50.66]Like, we can get you there.
[163:51.58]Nah, dude.
[163:52.28]Yeah, fuck that.
[163:53.10]Oh, fuck it.
[163:53.54]Who cares?
[163:54.62]Oh, it doesn't even hurt.
[163:56.10]Your hand is purple.
[163:57.22]It's blue, man.
[163:59.00]Nah, nah, it's not.
[164:01.72]You want, like, ice?
[164:02.56]No.
[164:03.72]You want a Tylenol?
[164:06.17]Nope.
[164:08.73]Sure?
[164:09.25]Like, are you sure?
[164:10.11]Sure.
[164:17.27]I'll sleep it off.
[164:18.91]The thing is, I do that shit all the time.
[164:29.18]I think it's the reason why people do that, and the reason why I do it too.
[164:32.27]I don't want you to think that, oh shit, the day is kind of ruined.
[164:38.09]This person's hurt.
[164:42.95]Everyone has to go home.
[164:45.55]We have to get out of here.
[164:46.43]We have to help this person.
[164:47.43]It's almost like, I don't want you to think that it's that bad.
[164:49.63]Even if, okay, if it's really bad, of course, right.
[164:52.56]Go to the hospital.
[164:54.20]But a lot of times it's like, fuck, this hurts, but I kind of don't want to make it seem like it's all about me.
[164:58.12]You know, like, aw, my hand hurts.
[165:00.86]It's all about me today, right?
[165:09.41]Alright, look, come on, I got it.
[165:12.28]Not wanting to burden people.
[165:13.42]Yeah, that's, yeah, exactly.
[165:16.20]I don't think it comes from, like, a tough guy complex.
[165:18.32]Maybe some of them do.
[165:22.54]It's mainly, I don't want to be a pain in the ass.
[165:34.51]Do something, man.
[165:35.07]What are you doing?
[165:47.70]It's 5-5.
[165:48.14]Somebody said these are really, really shitty weak serves.
[165:57.87]Oh, that's not good.
[165:59.89]I saved it.
[166:01.05]Set me up.
[166:01.61]Let's go.
[166:03.27]Wow.
[166:03.65]How did you get that?
[166:04.46]Impossible.
[166:07.06]Set me.
[166:10.64]Holy shit.
[166:13.44]Oh, where are you?
[166:14.66]Where are you?
[166:15.16]You're just standing around.
[166:22.60]match point alright let's go how are your sunflowers doing they are uh about to bloom they're kind of opening there are three of them are just about
[166:46.58]three and a half feet tall and this one gigantic mega sunflower that's going to be probably six or seven feet tall they're getting ready they're just about to open they're turning the the insides the cool part is um so three of them are just the standard um I don't know the name for them just the standard a large sunflower with the yellow and the black in the middle
[167:10.80]but one of them the big one is a mystery sunflower and I have no idea what color it is I have no idea what it's gonna look like it could be purple it could be red it could be like a dark orange I have no idea but this is gonna be six feet tall pictures yeah I'll show you guys
[167:33.08]Are you gonna eat the seeds?
[167:34.88]I don't know, sunflowers are really sad.
[167:36.58]And I'll tell you why.
[167:39.28]Because they're not perennial.
[167:41.37]Some sunflowers are perennial.
[167:43.79]Most sunflowers are annual.
[167:46.03]Which means you plant them, they grow up, it takes like two or three months to get to full bloom, and then they die.
[167:52.07]And that's it.
[167:53.85]They're dead.
[167:55.35]Their heads droop down, they wither away, and they die and they don't come back.
[167:59.10]It's actually kind of like sad.
[168:03.54]It's like, oh, all the time that it's been growing and all the care that I've given these things.
[168:07.94]And then they're gone forever.
[168:09.60]Two months.
[168:15.35]Yeah, it's like 40 to 60 days.
[168:17.91]But then you get a bunch of the seeds and you do it again next year.
[168:29.78]I'm not sure there are any giant sunflowers that are perennial.
[168:33.54]There might be.
[168:35.44]I was always under the assumption that all the big ones, because that's what I wanted.
[168:39.42]All the really, really big ones are annuals.
[168:42.38]Because I want these motherfuckers, I want them to be like 8 feet tall.
[168:54.33]What a funny stream.
[168:56.40]Oh, man, I'm just hanging out, man.
[168:57.54]We don't have to have everything be a joke, right?
[169:00.47]My sunflowers.
[169:01.13]What, are sunflowers a joke to you?
[169:02.71]Hey!
[169:04.29]What that guy timed up for?
[169:06.17]No.
[169:06.97]I want him to remember what he did.
[169:08.08]Time him up for a minute.
[169:22.54]I actually got really kind of into gardening and the plants.
[169:25.47]Well, let me rephrase that.
[169:28.05]I got into plants that I thought were cool looking.
[169:31.33]I think the sunflowers are really cool looking.
[169:39.38]Sunflowers.
[169:40.78]I have a money tree.
[169:42.62]Not one of the big ones.
[169:43.30]I have one of the little ones.
[169:45.70]That's cool.
[169:47.82]That's cool.
[169:49.35]Get up.
[169:56.82]He doesn't like ugly plants.
[169:59.08]That's not what I mean.
[169:59.91]Oh, shit!
[170:05.97]Alright, I took it off the face.
[170:06.75]I'm fine.
[170:12.83]Get there!
[170:21.13]I always wanted sunflowers, too.
[170:22.23]But here's the thing about sunflowers.
[170:24.01]Listen to this one.
[170:24.57]This is cool.
[170:25.71]Well, I mean, cool relatively of how cool you think this is.
[170:28.65]But I always wanted big sunflowers.
[170:30.39]But the game is really fucking loud as hell, isn't it?
[170:33.46]This is a loud-ass game right now.
[170:36.06]Hold on.
[170:41.10]Why is this... No, I don't want to do that.
[170:43.08]What the fuck?
[170:46.46]I do not want to do that.
[170:48.62]Come back.
[170:52.04]Like, I can see just how loud this is.
[170:54.03]It's really loud.
[170:54.75]Alright.
[170:55.69]Anyways.
[170:57.03]So... The thing about sunflowers...
[171:00.80]Sunflowers need a shitload of sunlight.
[171:03.82]You know, it's sunflowers in the name.
[171:06.25]So if you can't guarantee that your big kind of large sunflowers are not going to get at least six to eight full hours of bright sun a day, you can't have them.
[171:17.83]So when it was in Massachusetts, it was always like, oh, whoa, wouldn't it be cool to have like giant cool sunflowers?
[171:22.96]It's like, that's not going to happen.
[171:26.48]So they thrive out here.
[171:29.43]it's a hundred plus degrees fahrenheit every single day so they get huge they're so healthy they're gigantic something I've always kind of wanted really cool it's hard to garden in the cruel desert of Nevada yeah some stuff really does thrive out here though if you like cactuses all the kind of aloe vera type plants
[171:54.52]Broccoli seed packet.
[171:56.66]You told me to plant in February.
[171:58.34]I planted them in May and they died.
[171:59.60]Wait, when did I tell you to plant a broccoli seed packet?
[172:03.04]Wait, what?
[172:05.94]I didn't tell you to plant a broccoli?
[172:07.90]Get it!
[172:18.99]Alright, set me up.
[172:23.04]You killed their Broccoli.
[172:24.14]I didn't tell anybody to plant Broccoli.
[172:25.34]He doesn't remember?
[172:33.62]I never- I did not tell anybody to do Broccoli.
[172:42.15]Yeah, so Sunflowers.
[172:43.55]Because I've seen pictures of Sunflowers before.
[172:48.02]They look kind of cool.
[172:48.90]They're not that big.
[172:50.32]They have little flowers.
[172:51.72]I just won the gold medal.
[172:55.38]But I was one of the huge ones.
[172:58.31]And I have them.
[173:01.31]Four to six feet tall.
[173:07.25]I got 10,000 points.
[173:07.87]This is sick.
[173:14.42]I was trying to think of some other plants.
[173:18.61]That I can plant.
[173:20.85]That are kind of like sunflowers.
[173:23.03]That they need seven plus, six plus hours of sun every day.
[173:26.06]Then I'm just thinking, why don't you just get a bunch of different sunflower varieties?
[173:29.96]There's tons of them.
[173:33.00]I'm going to have a dozen sunflowers.
[173:35.24]Two dozen of just different kinds everywhere.
[173:41.52]Oh shit, hurdles.
[173:42.10]Hell yeah.
[173:44.35]Basil?
[173:45.41]I don't know if tomatoes would do well out here.
[173:46.87]I think it's too much.
[173:51.63]105, 106, 110 degrees Fahrenheit almost every day.
[173:53.40]I don't know if they would last.
[173:55.10]I'm not sure.
[173:55.52]Okay, tap A. And then press up to jump.
[174:08.67]Oh, dragon fruit?
[174:12.44]That's actually kind of not a bad idea.
[174:14.40]That's cool.
[174:19.82]I live in Arizona.
[174:20.52]Tomatoes do fine.
[174:21.64]That's good to know.
[174:22.72]I always thought the tomatoes couldn't take that much heat.
[174:28.03]In Texas, there's a massive bloom of small sunflower varieties.
[174:30.61]They'll just grow on the side of the freeway.
[174:32.49]That's awesome.
[174:34.87]Ugh.
[174:39.39]On your mark.
[174:42.10]Sunflowers are my favorite plant, if you didn't know.
[174:43.52]Should I tell you again?
[174:50.73]Sunflower seeds are actually one of my favorite things to eat for a snack too.
[174:53.89]I'm just a huge fan of sunflowers.
[175:09.79]Oh, get out of here.
[175:11.29]What a comeback.
[175:12.63]What a comeback.
[175:15.49]And I got a world record.
[175:28.80]Let's see it.
[175:33.84]I really picked it up at the end here, right here.
[175:45.96]Should you do a gardening stream?
[175:49.05]Um, I don't know.
[175:49.83]The thing about gardening streams, it's so hot out here that I can't, you physically can't be outside for more than like 10 to 20 minutes.
[176:01.93]Some of these days that are more than 105, 110, it's just like, holy shit, I can't even be out here for more than 20 minutes.
[176:19.96]Build a greenhouse?
[176:23.24]I don't... I don't think I can have a greenhouse.
[176:25.76]I'm sorry, guys.
[176:32.57]Set up a tarp.
[176:38.31]It's even hotter in there.
[176:39.35]Yeah, wouldn't the greenhouse be like 150 degrees out here?
[176:56.02]That was pretty good.
[177:04.73]I can't believe there's so many other people in chat that are from Phoenix.
[177:09.49]That is kind of weird.
[177:10.25]Well, I guess there are over 10,000 people here.
[177:14.72]How many cities are in America?
[177:20.52]There's gotta be one person from each city in America here, right?
[177:26.20]Oh, but that's also worldwide.
[177:27.80]It is very late though for EU.
[177:29.08]I'm not sure very many EU are here still.
[177:30.52]Maybe you are.
[177:32.64]Alright, I'm going to blow this out.
[177:46.91]I am here.
[177:47.77]Yeah.
[177:51.68]Wisconsin gang.
[177:53.50]Billy in the house.
[177:54.78]Michigan bros.
[177:57.37]Chicago.
[177:58.25]Alabama.
[177:58.77]Phoenix Gang.
[178:02.85]Texas.
[178:03.95]Canada.
[178:05.01]Colorado.
[178:07.91]I have yet to... Yeah, there we go.
[178:09.09]This is New York.
[178:09.61]I'm actually surprised it took that long.
[178:15.12]Austin.
[178:15.78]Oh, there we go.
[178:20.60]Alright, I got under 11.
[178:30.62]Chao!
[178:33.18]No, I lost all the way.
[178:34.70]What a bad time to lose.
[178:36.20]Fuck.
[178:37.98]Whatever.
[178:38.30]What have I not done?
[178:45.79]Oh, the swimming.
[178:47.13]I completely forgot about swimming.
[178:48.37]100mm freestyle.
[179:01.71]Orange County.
[179:02.25]Alright.
[179:07.73]Hit A. Alternate between left and right when the arrows overlap.
[179:11.99]So, bing, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong.
[179:15.57]Okay.
[179:17.06]Press A when the circles overlap to turn.
[179:18.96]Keep pressing it afterwards to speed up.
[179:21.44]Okay.
[179:21.62]So, A. Okay.
[179:25.48]Press LB to get a speed boost when your gauge is full.
[179:28.14]Don't use it too early.
[179:28.92]Alright.
[179:36.32]A lot of people outside of Wisconsin pronounce it so fucked up.
[179:38.67]It's just Wisconsin, not Wisconsin.
[179:41.03]Did I say Wisconsin?
[179:53.26]It's a hidden minigame where you put on hockey equipment and your brother throws baseballs at you.
[179:56.54]That was pretty good.
[180:04.32]Take your marks.
[180:23.94]And... Ooh.
[180:26.74]I'm in first.
[180:37.13]Oh, shit.
[180:38.19]Get there.
[180:39.79]Alright.
[180:40.07]I'm good.
[180:40.33]I'm good.
[180:42.29]I got passed out at the finish line.
[180:48.24]Cramp, cramp, cramp.
[180:51.74]Ha, ha, ha.
[181:02.26]Where in the world have you traveled to?
[181:03.52]Favorite destination.
[181:06.56]I'm actually a non-travel Andy.
[181:12.39]I've only been to continental North America.
[181:15.29]I've never traveled outside of the country besides Canada.
[181:20.59]I've never left North America.
[181:27.80]I've been to a lot of places in North America I've been to almost every major city in America except for most of the middle American states I've been to pretty much all the major cities that like at least the tourist attraction cities I've been to New York I've been to Los Angeles I've been to San Diego Long Beach Las Vegas oh I forgot I was playing
[182:19.22]Oh!
[182:21.22]Oh my god, did I win?
[182:27.25]Remind me not to do that again.
[182:35.89]Yeah, I want to travel, though.
[182:46.94]We're literally looking at a city that I want to go to.
[182:51.83]I've wanted to go to Tokyo for probably the last decade.
[182:55.81]It's just one of those places I want to see.
[183:04.54]I want to go to Tokyo.
[183:06.66]I want to go to Ireland.
[183:08.94]I want to go to... I want to go to... Somewhere in South America.
[183:18.05]I want to go to... Where are some of the major places I really want to go?
[183:23.83]I want to London, right?
[183:25.07]Just like these places I've never seen before.
[183:26.36]Take your marks.
[183:48.57]shit slows down alright now when I get close we do it go to Russia we love eating sunflower seeds too I'm to Peru I'm not gonna the second part of that I'm not gonna read
[184:20.53]You're being a bit of a rip of Rodney.
[184:22.31]What's that?
[184:32.25]Please don't go to Tokyo.
[184:33.92]Why not?
[184:34.24]I want Australia, too.
[184:41.26]Look, I know everyone that... I just said Australia.
[184:45.80]There are probably Australians here right now that are going to say...
[184:49.62]Australia I don't know you don't go to Australia why would you go to Australia dude it's just a more dangerous Nevada it's just Nevada but like you can die and it's like okay but I kind of want to see it I want to see Sydney I want to see the outback I think it's probably I think it's cool
[185:19.76]Just don't swim and you'll be fine.
[185:25.22]Hey, to swim, use L and R. The swimming controls change depending on the stroke.
[185:29.67]What?
[185:31.83]Oh, okay.
[185:32.37]This is going to be weird.
[185:35.67]Swim speeds affect your stamina.
[185:36.93]Swimming faster will lower your stamina.
[185:38.90]Quicker.
[185:39.38]That's kind of goofy looking.
[185:42.44]That looks like they're deliberately just dunking their heads.
[185:44.74]Just like... Press A when the circles overlap.
[185:49.78]Okay, yeah.
[185:50.20]Alright, let's do it.
[185:55.19]Do a world tour.
[186:01.81]Thoughts on New Orleans?
[186:02.69]I've never been.
[186:05.59]Seems like an interesting place to go.
[186:17.21]Nevada is a budget Australia.
[186:19.96]I mean, I don't know if I agree with that.
[186:38.61]Butterfly, okay.
[186:45.00]Oh my god, I'm going fast.
[186:48.54]I'm out of stamina.
[186:49.72]Alright, sled on.
[186:55.00]Am I backwards?
[187:07.74]Hold on, I just want to make it interesting.
[187:27.40]Oh shit, I'm not doing alright.
[187:33.74]Is he alright?
[187:36.52]It's all about managing.
[187:45.18]Okay.
[187:54.84]How are you supposed to do this?
[188:10.97]I'm to Colorado.
[188:11.79]I want to go to Colorado.
[188:12.65]Alright, keep the pace up, but don't go crazy.
[188:36.70]I'll get pizza in New Jersey.
[188:47.41]That's one thing I miss about the East Coast is the pizza.
[188:50.59]Holy shit, the pizza out here is awful.
[188:53.03]It's just fucking awful.
[188:56.19]It's one thing that I did never anticipate with Nevada.
[189:00.73]And that's the holy shit, there's no good pizza.
[189:11.12]Vegas has everything else.
[189:14.13]Everything else you could possibly want.
[189:15.53]It's all the best.
[189:28.17]Mexican food is great in Nevada?
[189:29.78]Oh my god, it's so good.
[189:35.34]You know, I've heard.
[189:36.64]I've heard.
[189:38.42]A lot of the Mexican food in Vegas is actually... People are going to freak out when I say this.
[189:44.57]I've only had a couple of Mexican places in California.
[189:47.11]I'll be honest.
[189:48.23]But I've heard that Vegas has actually some of the better of the two.
[189:53.25]Versus Los Angeles.
[189:54.98]And versus a lot of places in California.
[189:56.62]I've heard Vegas has... It's up there as probably the top few in the country.
[190:05.50]Oh, it's not a line.
[190:06.24]No way.
[190:07.61]I've had some Mexican places here that I, without a doubt, say that's one of the best things I've ever had in my life.
[190:13.11]Like, in my whole life.
[190:14.15]I know Texas.
[190:14.91]Texas has some incredible Mexican, too.
[190:21.58]Man, some of these places out here are unbelievable.
[190:29.94]You trying it doesn't make it the best.
[190:31.90]What?
[190:32.58]Do I have, like, four taste buds?
[190:39.40]Is my tongue made out of Play-Doh?
[190:40.52]What are you talking about?
[190:41.72]I know good food when I eat it.
[191:00.52]You put in and out in D. Yes, where it belongs.
[191:03.04]I didn't put it in D, I put it in C. Or did I put it in D?
[191:12.78]Hurry up, get there!
[191:13.38]What the fuck am I doing?
[191:15.44]Hurry up!
[191:19.54]In-N-Out's not bad.
[191:20.97]There's nothing wrong with In-N-Out.
[191:23.27]It's just not this, like, weird... It's not this god-tier burger place that everybody says it is.
[191:43.80]I am not doing well.
[191:45.00]I've paced this so horribly.
[191:46.16]I at least got a place, right?
[192:03.86]Holy shit, I'm in first place and I just beat him?
[192:10.45]Oh!
[192:14.28]No, I've already talked about why I think In-N-Out sucks.
[192:17.08]And I just said sucks, but you know, just delete that part.
[192:20.60]The reason why I don't really like In-N-Out is because if you go through the In-N-Out drive-thru, they put the burgers and shit in these half-open bags.
[192:29.34]The burgers are out.
[192:30.28]They're in like a little half-open bag box thing.
[192:33.13]It's like, wrap that shit up.
[192:34.53]Wrap it up.
[192:35.63]Wrap it up.
[192:37.65]If I take shit to go, I don't want like my burger to be sitting like half out of the package.
[192:42.05]I hate that.
[192:45.09]Especially if you get more than a few things.
[192:50.76]Just tell them to do that.
[192:54.18]And I don't like the fact that the secret menu, just put it on the menu.
[192:57.89]Everybody knows it exists.
[192:58.81]It's like they have like three things listed on the menu, but the menu is actually like 30 items long.
[193:07.25]Why?
[193:23.39]Then it wouldn't be a secret.
[193:24.39]I don't, I actually like In-N-Out, I do.
[193:35.58]The East Coaster food arrogance is way overplayed.
[193:38.00]I mean, one of my favorite restaurants is McDonald's.
[193:44.78]Why are you even listening to half the things I say about food?
[194:01.39]Alright, I gotta, I gotta slow down.
[194:12.10]Four taste buds.
[194:16.16]Oh, see you later!
[194:17.06]I'm gonna get first!
[194:21.38]Oh, don't slow down!
[194:22.75]Yeah!
[194:31.72]Now, In-N-Out's burgers taste good.
[194:33.96]Their food is good.
[194:35.68]Their food is better.
[194:36.66]It's like a higher quality than McDonald's, okay?
[194:48.01]I just, some of their practices, I've just, it's just weird to me.
[194:57.71]I think I did every event, did I?
[194:59.53]I want to do a couple more than one.
[195:00.91]Oh, no, no, I didn't do the 100 meter relay.
[195:01.81]Oh, it's the one where you pass it, right?
[195:04.31]Oh, nice.
[195:04.73]I love this one.
[195:08.23]Alright, look, let me amend what I just said about everything.
[195:13.54]In and out is good, but the way that people talk about in and out is as if... I just burped really loudly.
[195:21.18]I suppressed it.
[195:21.68]I don't know if you heard it.
[195:24.90]It's just people talk, like, as if In-N-Out is... Like, Gordon Ramsay personally made it for you.
[195:31.28]In your living room.
[195:34.42]It's good, but, I mean, it's... People just talk about it like it's a coming of God.
[195:38.67]Okay, rapidly tap A, you got it, yep, yep, yep.
[195:46.19]Pass the baton, alright.
[195:52.24]Gordon Ramsay loves In-N-Out?
[195:54.90]I don't think he does.
[196:00.98]Oh, so you keep the speed.
[196:02.00]That's pretty cool.
[196:06.44]Irma, In-N-Out is good, but the way they talk about In-N-Out, I just burped loudly Elbertson.
[196:17.80]I have family that take 8-hour car trips just for In-N-Out.
[196:20.91]Why?
[196:21.55]What?
[196:22.03]No.
[196:23.58]That's... How... Where do they... That's across, like, how many states?
[196:29.22]You're driving across the country to go in and out?
[196:31.88]What?
[196:32.62]No.
[196:35.86]That's not real.
[196:47.61]Oh, wait, I have to go, like, right in here, right?
[196:50.71]Oh, that's weird.
[196:51.17]I feel like I play Starter Valley Fishing and I don't like it.
[196:57.53]Late?
[196:57.81]What are you talking about?
[197:06.79]Late?
[197:07.13]That's such a weird mechanic.
[197:12.83]Do it again.
[197:25.27]Can't imagine not having East Coast pizza.
[197:26.79]I would cry.
[197:28.59]Sometimes I just sit there and I just imagine what it tastes like.
[197:40.24]What is that weird drop?
[197:47.65]This is weird.
[197:48.15]I'm just tapping.
[197:48.57]I'm tapping at the same... This is bizarre.
[197:50.59]This thing is fucked.
[198:03.61]Why is it dropping like that?
[198:05.13]That's crazy.
[198:08.38]I once got a pizza outside the East Coast.
[198:09.80]It was a little cracker with ketchup.
[198:15.66]What?
[198:15.86]Are you sure you were ordering pizza?
[198:34.45]That's pretending like the West Coast doesn't have good pizza.
[198:37.83]There are probably places that I haven't had that are really good.
[198:42.02]I've been trying, though.
[198:42.88]I've been trying a lot of places out here.
[198:51.62]Lunchable.
[198:55.02]Oh, man.
[198:55.85]Lunchable's pizza.
[198:57.87]Ugh.
[198:57.99]It doesn't even taste real.
[199:10.17]Good pass.
[199:16.89]Good pass.
[199:17.65]That's alright, that's gonna qualify.
[199:29.52]Oh fuck, it didn't qualify.
[199:41.89]Nevada pizza's dirt.
[199:49.34]In-N-Out fries are not good.
[199:53.25]Wait, I did make it to the finals.
[199:54.17]I thought it was top three.
[199:58.55]Lunchables are so weird.
[200:00.82]Dude, I...
[200:03.55]I don't- I- I mean, I understand their existence, and I used to eat them.
[200:07.20]But some of them are so bizarrely awful, it's- okay.
[200:10.80]You guys remember Dr. Dreadful?
[200:13.68]Those weird edible science kits!
[200:16.46]That's how I feel about the Lunchables pizza.
[200:19.66]It may as well be Dr. Dreadful.
[200:25.81]I just- it's- I- like, it tastes so... odd.
[200:30.69]This is such a bizarre thing you do.
[200:32.26]You put, like, the ketchup, like, paste, tomato paste on it, on, like, the weird, like, breakable, chalky bread thing.
[200:40.80]I just feel like, I just, why would you, why even sell it?
[200:50.31]The kids love it.
[201:03.27]That was a good pass.
[201:11.58]Not bad.
[201:12.06]Not bad.
[201:17.47]Good.
[201:20.49]Oh, my God.
[201:21.07]I'm in sixth place.
[201:21.83]I thought I did that really well.
[201:29.86]House Cursor?
[201:30.50]Sorry about that.
[201:32.66]This one's hard.
[201:40.48]I had an awful start.
[201:41.34]Probably did.
[201:42.48]Well, here's Rugby.
[201:45.31]One thing I haven't done.
[201:46.21]Alright, I'm gonna do Rugby.
[201:47.99]And then I wanna go back to... I wanna go back to Long Jump.
[201:52.83]Because I feel like I didn't get that one.
[201:54.87]That was one of the first ones I did.
[201:57.37]And then I wanna do...
[202:02.19]Mmm, which one do I want to do?
[202:03.43]Maybe basketball again.
[202:09.96]Where's the javelin?
[202:18.54]Old vault?
[202:19.24]Javelin?
[202:19.88]What's going on here?
[202:20.54]Okay, pass the ball to the side or behind you, press A.
[202:31.26]When you get past the try line, press A to score a try worth 5 points.
[202:36.88]Okay.
[202:40.24]Score an additional 2 points by converting a try.
[202:43.00]Press A. Holy shit, that looks hard.
[202:47.94]This is just American football on hardcore mode.
[202:54.57]No, they don't have helmets on?
[202:55.75]What?
[202:58.29]What?
[203:05.76]Why have I never watched this?
[203:06.84]Okay.
[203:12.40]When not in possession of the ball, press A to tackle.
[203:14.31]When in possession, press X to guard against tackles.
[203:18.27]Okay.
[203:21.25]Special dash, right?
[203:22.19]Or whatever.
[203:25.74]Rugby's actually safer and has less concussions.
[203:27.62]Really?
[203:27.78]Really?
[203:33.42]No helmets and pads means they're not using their helmets and pads as weapons.
[203:36.92]That's true.
[203:39.00]Going down with the helmet into helmet.
[203:48.97]I don't know what I did, but cool.
[203:56.12]Alright, pass it.
[204:01.55]Get me in there.
[204:05.24]Shit.
[204:07.72]So it's just fumble the game.
[204:09.30]Oops.
[204:17.70]Got it.
[204:25.65]How big is the field?
[204:35.20]Alright, this is a little more ridiculous than I thought it was gonna be.
[204:42.60]Shit.
[204:45.52]Oh, come on.
[204:46.44]Really?
[204:46.78]What'd he do?
[204:53.34]What are these bounces, bro?
[204:55.74]What were those bounces?
[204:57.80]Are you kidding me?
[205:12.24]Get me over there.
[205:12.94]Oh, shit.
[205:18.38]Go.
[205:20.56]Yes.
[205:25.28]This is kind of cool.
[205:29.44]It's football, but you don't stop every 10 seconds.
[205:31.50]Yeah.
[205:33.24]Oh, right.
[205:33.64]I got to convert it.
[205:34.24]There it is.
[205:40.46]So how much is that worth?
[205:41.34]Two points?
[205:46.06]That's way less useless than the extra point.
[205:52.91]Actually, that's very meaningful.
[205:54.17]Did they actually play this in the Summer Olympics?
[206:10.79]It's football, just stupid.
[206:14.65]Why would it be stupid?
[206:16.09]What do you mean?
[206:26.80]That's so... Ugh.
[206:43.25]Can I drop kick it?
[206:45.57]Or do we just have to run till we get tackled and throw it to somebody else for them to get tackled?
[206:50.53]Shit.
[207:07.63]This is perfect for me, though.
[207:09.47]You know why this is perfect for me?
[207:11.75]I'll tell you.
[207:13.27]What is it, Jerma?
[207:13.98]Tell us.
[207:14.98]Okay.
[207:15.84]So when I played Madden against my brother, we played Madden all the time.
[207:21.18]Uh, you know, it'd be like, oh, I'm going to be the Patriots and you'll be the Jets or whatever.
[207:24.98]It didn't matter.
[207:26.20]My brother would always win by, usually it was about 70 to 80 plus points.
[207:32.92]I think I scored maybe once or twice.
[207:35.02]But the reason because what I would do, because I knew I just was terrible at that.
[207:38.34]What the fuck was that?
[207:39.30]Alright, you can do that.
[207:41.24]So the reason why I was so bad at it and the reason why I had no attention span for the football games, I would do the select a new player.
[207:48.86]So you know when you're on the defensive line or whatever offensive line, so you select the one player that you're going to play with, that you can actually move around.
[207:55.45]So what I would do is I would hit A to select next person in line and X to tackle.
[208:01.26]So I'd go, AX, AX, AX, AX, AX, AX, AX, AX, AX, AX, AX, AX, AX, AX.
[208:04.04]And they would just, everybody would just dive.
[208:06.42]And sometimes it would work and it would piss him off a lot.
[208:09.09]But 90% of the time, he would just run back for a touchdown.
[208:23.17]So this is perfect.
[208:24.61]This is exactly what I want.
[208:26.23]That's what you do in this game.
[208:33.48]It was always so funny because whenever it worked, it was just like, you could just see the anger in his face.
[208:37.89]Because every single person dives and tackles the person in front of them, and if he happened to do like a running play, he was screwed.
[208:46.75]Get off me.
[208:47.41]Shit.
[208:59.19]How many halves are there?
[209:02.11]Wait, I can do a super tackle?
[209:03.27]Give me extra time.
[209:12.54]This seems very unfair.
[209:13.50]Oh, and I would do this too.
[209:17.55]If I ever got to a point where I had the ball, I would run like this and taunt.
[209:21.55]And then jump.
[209:23.21]Right at the last second before he tackled me.
[209:34.28]Sometimes he would actually get me, and I wouldn't get the touchdown.
[209:37.02]And I would throw an interception, do XA, XA, XA, XA, and then he would run it back 95 yards for a touchdown.
[209:49.64]That was bad.
[209:50.14]Watch the camera.
[209:51.90]Watch the camera.
[209:52.26]Full time.
[210:07.16]Let me see, you're playing in Dome?
[210:10.64]Yeah, why would there be that much wind?
[210:14.05]It seems very windy.
[210:14.85]They turned on the AC.
[210:37.67]What's your favorite Olympic sport?
[210:38.71]Probably the javelin throw.
[210:41.85]Or the pole vault.
[210:43.75]Just... Pole vault is something that aliens invented.
[210:47.02]You know what I mean?
[210:47.60]Like, what a strange, weird, old-timey thing to do.
[210:52.58]I love the pole vault because it really just reminds me of a Wile E. Coyote cartoon.
[211:09.28]I'm laughing about something.
[211:10.32]I'm just thinking of like a pole vault video.
[211:16.23]I think you all know the one too.
[211:17.43]Did they score?
[211:25.32]Shit.
[211:31.20]Oh, it's so bad.
[211:32.14]It's not.
[211:32.70]It's like sucks, but it's... What the hell are you doing?
[211:41.16]No, there's a guy, there's a moment where the guy, the pole hits like the guy right, right in the balls.
[211:46.88]It's horrible.
[211:48.16]It's not cool.
[211:51.48]It sucks.
[212:02.85]Why is, why am I getting a safety?
[212:06.65]Oh my god.
[212:07.35]Alright, I gotta get better.
[212:33.36]I'm laughing at what you guys are saying.
[212:36.90]Holy shit, that was pretty sick.
[212:47.17]Come on, I need it.
[212:59.79]No, please.
[213:00.69]Get it!
[213:10.82]Throw it!
[213:17.18]Good run, good run, good run.
[213:19.14]Good run.
[213:22.66]I can't, sorry.
[213:24.84]I'm trying.
[213:30.36]By the way, I would do pass interference every single play.
[213:34.27]There were a lot of times where I would play Madden versus my brother, where it would be like, I would get so many penalties against myself that he would be pushed so forward.
[213:47.88]Or I would go offsides, and it was like, oh, well, I wonder how they're going to do this one, John.
[213:54.64]Well, you know, they're first and 60.
[214:00.42]A lot of penalties!
[214:02.06]Oh my god, I'm getting my ass kicked.
[214:16.05]I think I just give up.
[214:23.94]And he would, you know what, he would say the same shit that you guys say.
[214:27.42]It's all coming back to me.
[214:30.25]You know what I mean?
[214:30.69]You ever get like in this mode where you're just like, fuck, like all of my faults are like in front of me right now.
[214:36.05]He would be like, dude, play the game.
[214:39.07]I'd be like, I am.
[214:39.95]He's like, play the, play the game, dude.
[214:44.47]I'd be like, what?
[214:51.64]No, come on.
[214:52.42]Let me get it.
[215:02.01]Wait, you can help somebody jump?
[215:06.07]Get it to the star player, come on.
[215:17.97]Get it to the star player!
[215:19.47]No!
[215:20.01]I want it to this guy.
[215:20.97]Is it more points?
[215:39.16]That was really cool.
[215:39.94]Alright, there's really... There's no wind.
[215:45.16]Excuse me?
[215:46.46]That was per... What was wrong with that?
[215:58.63]Don't... Alright, perfect.
[216:00.43]This is awesome.
[216:00.95]This will be good.
[216:02.13]God damn it.
[216:07.35]Oh, come on.
[216:09.08]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[216:24.09]Who is the best rugby team in the world?
[216:32.90]I want to say Australia.
[216:33.86]Australia.
[216:46.25]Nice dodge.
[216:51.07]Shit.
[216:57.97]They seem pretty good, New Zealand.
[217:03.14]I haven't played the bronze medal match.
[217:04.38]No, we just quit.
[217:07.66]Everybody just get on the bus.
[217:12.02]Olympic Games.
[217:17.47]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[217:19.58]There it is.
[217:19.90]Long jump.
[217:20.34]Alright.
[217:21.50]I gotta get this right.
[217:22.14]I was doing this so wrong.
[217:23.16]Where's X at the top of the jump?
[217:26.10]That's not... I'm doing... I gotta do that now.
[217:34.75]You have a teacher voice?
[217:35.87]I do?
[217:38.35]Well, thanks.
[217:40.15]Did I say thanks?
[217:42.87]Okay, here we go.
[217:53.60]What was that?
[217:53.98]That had to have been pretty good.
[217:55.50]6.
[217:58.74]That input angle is so awful.
[218:01.34]That's hard to do that shit.
[218:05.08]It was a compliment?
[218:05.88]Oh, thank you.
[218:17.06]That was not bad.
[218:17.76]That's probably at least 7, right? 6.8.
[218:29.12]I don't know, can I do better than that?
[218:30.48]Hey Zurich!
[218:35.72]Thanks for the 10.
[218:37.88]Community, what's up?
[218:39.07]8?
[218:39.09]6 points, 7.3, nice.
[218:59.98]I didn't do the clap, you're right.
[219:01.50]I'll do the clap for the last one.
[219:10.14]Why is your character a Guilty Gear background NPC?
[219:15.03]I feel like that was really funny, but I've never played that game.
[219:21.51]I want to laugh at that, but... I don't, you know, I can't laugh at that because I don't know what that is.
[219:36.61]Sound effects is called Sound Ideas Scream Male Agony.
[219:39.05]Hold on, hold on a second.
[219:46.47]Oh yeah, you guys had homework, that's right.
[219:52.21]Is it Male Agony?
[219:53.03]Not that one.
[220:09.48]Where can I get it?
[220:10.76]Male Agony 1?
[220:21.88]Where is it?
[220:28.71]Do the roar.
[220:29.25]Oh, I think I found it.
[220:41.60]How do I play it?
[220:42.12]Is it?
[220:51.43]But it's slowed down.
[220:53.03]The pitch has changed.
[221:08.26]Nice job.
[221:08.76]You got an A. You got an A+.
[221:12.14]Okay, cool.
[221:13.20]Let's go.
[221:21.36]What's the context?
[221:22.16]Oh, for those of you that weren't here.
[221:27.29]That sound effect is something I would do randomly for no reason.
[221:31.69]I would just go, and it turns out it was from The Simpsons arcade game.
[221:37.37]It was the first boss.
[221:39.93]I did not know what the sound was, and I desperately wanted it, so I said, hey, you guys have homework.
[221:44.37]Whoever finds me that shit, you get, hey, thank you.
[221:49.72]And you found it.
[221:58.19]That was bad.
[221:58.65]Alright, I gotta do better.
[221:59.65]Come on.
[222:00.83]Alright, my, like, elbow is locking up from tapping fast this, like, three and a half hours.
[222:04.75]That has to be pretty good.
[222:11.82]Is that a fault?
[222:16.26]What?
[222:16.56]Final try.
[222:34.21]Oh, that's so stupid That would be remarkable if they actually did that once I can't do this one this one sucks
[223:06.44]What's the other one I wanted to do?
[223:10.52]Basketball.
[223:11.06]There it is.
[223:11.42]Alright.
[223:12.16]I want to put it... Yeah.
[223:13.24]I want to do basketball.
[223:14.02]This was fun.
[223:19.03]First time ever watching a live livestream.
[223:20.75]This is long.
[223:23.55]Um... Yeah, I never expect anybody to... I mean... And I don't stream as long as most people do.
[223:31.55]Six hours is a long time.
[223:32.77]It's a lot.
[223:33.41]It's a big commitment to sit here and watch.
[223:37.58]There's almost 10,000 of you still here.
[223:38.98]I hope you're having fun.
[223:43.39]I'm just having fun.
[223:45.33]Oh, the stream schedule is going to be a little different this coming next few weeks.
[223:48.87]So we're going to do... I know I usually do the weekends.
[223:53.58]But there's been a handful of things I had to pay attention to over the last weekend or two.
[223:58.56]So we're going to do Thursday of next week.
[224:01.82]And then we're also going to do Saturday or Sunday of next week too.
[224:04.58]To kind of get back on the weekend.
[224:06.98]So next week will be Thursday and Saturday and Sunday.
[224:12.33]Saturday or Sunday, whatever.
[224:14.76]I'll stream twice next week.
[224:17.97]So then we'll just be on Saturday.
[224:19.65]And be back to normal.
[224:29.42]You won't do that?
[224:30.40]I promise you I will.
[224:39.86]Take care of your health though.
[224:41.00]Yeah, I haven't really given you guys an update on that in a few months.
[224:47.83]I might be some things that I... Why you get a special camera?
[224:51.99]I might be doing some things here in the next month or two.
[224:56.74]I might just go for a... I'll talk about it if it's ever real.
[225:00.86]Because I don't want to have anybody be like, wait, wait, what are you doing?
[225:15.58]That's perfect.
[225:16.10]Are you kidding me?
[225:21.20]Okay.
[225:30.60]What are you doing?
[225:33.34]Um... A couple things.
[225:38.17]Maybe.
[225:49.43]One thing that's going to happen, that just is going to happen, is not some secret, so I'll just tell you.
[225:56.19]Eventually, over the next probably few months, I'm probably going to have hernia surgery.
[226:02.52]Just to get that out of the way.
[226:03.58]Because it's really, really possible that that's just been the problem the entire time.
[226:10.24]Even though I've been told it might not be.
[226:12.30]So I'm probably just going to do it.
[226:14.26]Just do it to me.
[226:15.02]Because that's the only thing that's really an outlier.
[226:19.64]So, I want to do that.
[226:24.40]Even if it doesn't fix anything, if that doesn't solve the problem, I feel like at this point it probably is the problem.
[226:34.05]And after all the stuff that we've talked about, all the other appointments I've had, it's like, alright, that's the thing that's really wrong with you.
[226:40.48]That's what's wrong with you.
[226:42.64]There ain't really anything else wrong with you.
[226:45.20]This one small thing with my spine, that is probably not what's going on.
[226:49.70]So... No one's been able to find anything really else.
[226:53.61]Besides, yeah, whatever, I have a little prostate issue, but whatever.
[226:56.25]So... If you're new to the channel, and you're like, what the fuck is this guy talking about?
[227:04.49]So for the last few years, especially the last two years, I've had a pain problem.
[227:12.07]Where my, essentially my entire core, um, that was so stupid.
[227:18.24]Such a, what a terrible show-off thing to do.
[227:22.22]Um, so my, like, chest and back just hurt all the time, 24-7.
[227:26.26]It's never gotten worse, it's never gotten better.
[227:29.70]It's probably like a 4 out of 10 in pain every single day, every moment of my life for the last three years.
[227:35.61]Um, you're probably also wondering, is that why you went to once a week?
[227:38.53]Yes.
[227:38.81]Yes.
[227:40.11]I stream once a week.
[227:41.79]Maybe twice a week.
[227:43.03]To alleviate some of those problems.
[227:45.39]And I'm working on it.
[227:46.63]And hopefully... Why do I keep doing that?
[227:49.35]What the hell is going on?
[227:50.65]How did I get that?
[227:51.23]Are you ever going to get... Don't sink that.
[228:07.66]Whatever.
[228:08.00]I win.
[228:12.57]But, yeah, I... That's why I... You're probably like, holy shit, dude, why don't you stream?
[228:18.94]Like, stream.
[228:20.72]Only once a week.
[228:21.94]I'm just dialing it back.
[228:23.84]And I had to stay permanent because... Sitting down, and even standing, but pretty much anything, like, if I'm honest.
[228:31.93]I thought about maybe if I stand up and get a standing desk and like take breaks.
[228:35.03]It doesn't really matter.
[228:35.83]It's just there 24-7.
[228:38.14]I could stretch.
[228:38.78]I could sit.
[228:40.06]I could stand.
[228:40.64]I could roll around.
[228:41.38]Doesn't matter.
[228:42.48]So it's really just like being still for a long time.
[228:47.73]Unless I'm like lying on my back.
[228:49.89]It can be pretty painful.
[228:57.90]Have you tried acupuncture?
[228:59.50]I have done physical therapy.
[229:01.04]I've done chiropractic work.
[229:04.00]I've done Gua Sha.
[229:05.84]I've done Gua Sha.
[229:08.11]Some of you don't know what that is.
[229:10.33]I've gone to rheumatoid arthritis doctors.
[229:13.43]I've gone to gastroenterologists.
[229:16.23]I've gone to brain doctors because maybe it's something going on neurologically with my nerves.
[229:21.41]If you name it, I've probably been there.
[229:30.72]I have a hernia.
[229:33.82]That's the one thing that anyone really has been like, well, we got that.
[229:37.48]It's probably causing you some kind of a problem.
[229:43.84]So I don't know.
[229:44.36]At some point, maybe I gave myself a hiatal hernia and it's twisting me up and it's making my like kind of middle of my chest and back hurt.
[229:52.63]I don't know, but I'm probably going to get the hernia surgery.
[229:59.98]Because at least it'll be one of those things that I look back and I go, alright, I did that thing.
[230:10.02]Fucking green screen stream?
[230:11.34]No, no, no.
[230:12.82]I was having problems two years before the green screen.
[230:18.41]Why can I not talk?
[230:20.49]Before the green screen stream, I had a lot of problems before that.
[230:25.91]There's a spell update for you.
[230:30.31]I was still in Massachusetts when this started happening.
[230:33.84]So this is pre-Vegas.
[230:47.84]Oh, perfect shot.
[231:00.39]Yeah, I lost a lot of weight before the green screen stream.
[231:03.03]Yeah, and I think that's probably a combination of a few things.
[231:08.89]You know, maybe, because I... You know, when you get in a position where you're just like, what the fuck is wrong with me?
[231:14.64]Is it the food I'm eating?
[231:15.64]Do I, should I like eat, like, okay, I'm not going to eat bread.
[231:19.40]I'm not going to eat meat.
[231:20.64]I'm only going to eat like fucking, I'm going to keep my diet like really small and maybe I'm having problems because it's gastrointestinal.
[231:30.78]Maybe it's just, you know, I'm moving around too much.
[231:32.82]I gotta stop moving.
[231:34.12]I'm not moving enough.
[231:34.76]I have to move.
[231:38.48]And yeah, it's still, I still have no idea what's going on.
[231:42.76]So, I mean, frustrating is the word to use.
[231:46.40]Um, but, like, I can't change anything, right?
[231:49.63]Like, all I can do is try to fix it, whatever it is, and score this right now.
[231:53.89]Oh.
[232:05.31]I almost just blocked it.
[232:09.93]Somebody give a hundred community subs?
[232:16.15]Thanks for the one hundred subs.
[232:20.82]A hundred.
[232:22.12]One zero zero.
[232:23.16]One hundred community subs.
[232:26.02]That's insanely generous of you.
[232:30.18]Never necessary.
[232:32.97]I appreciate it.
[232:34.11]Thank you.
[232:34.63]It's a lot of fucking money.
[232:38.35]Thank you.
[232:44.29]But I've gotten, you know, I've gotten used to it.
[232:49.42]There are days where I get up and I'm just like, what the fuck?
[232:53.50]But those are very far, those are very far away from each other.
[233:05.68]I mean, when this was first happening, the first six months of this happening, I was all over the place.
[233:13.48]I was like, what the hell's wrong with me?
[233:27.11]At 24, I've had back and stomach problems since I was 14.
[233:29.73]I can relate to your issues.
[233:40.25]If you're over 30, believe in your health and do your checkups.
[233:42.41]Yeah, I went to the doctor every year.
[233:44.69]I did my physical every year.
[233:45.95]Would you say you're more reserved now because of the pain?
[233:58.48]Probably in a way, yeah.
[234:01.46]It's sort of just always in the back of my mind that it's there.
[234:07.59]But it's not... Let me make this really clear too though.
[234:11.79]This is not a scenario where I am like suffering right now.
[234:17.07]No.
[234:18.79]I take a certain amount of supplements.
[234:20.45]I do a certain amount of activity.
[234:22.65]I only stream once a week for usually no longer than like five or six hours usually, right?
[234:28.58]Like I'm alright.
[234:31.31]I can move around, I can walk, I can, like, drive a car, I can... I could, like, run down... I could run right now.
[234:37.68]I could sprint right now if I wanted to.
[234:40.22]So, don't... It's not a... Don't think that I'm sitting here just truly suffering and, like, oh my god, I gotta get the fuck out of here!
[234:49.14]No.
[235:03.25]Not, no, not life-threatening.
[235:09.96]But there are a lot of new people here, though.
[235:13.18]The channel has exploded in the last three to six months.
[235:18.66]So, I do want to let some of the newer people that are here know what's going on.
[235:24.28]What does this mean?
[235:25.08]Why is it, what is he talking about?
[235:32.81]Did I just try to pick that up off the ground?
[235:36.69]I've only been here since February?
[235:38.81]Well, welcome.
[235:39.43]I hope you like it.
[235:40.47]I hope you're having fun.
[235:54.09]I'm here for the battleship stream.
[235:55.66]That's in.
[236:05.96]What was that?
[236:06.70]Why would you do it behind your head?
[236:09.23]Shoot it!
[236:23.47]Been here for four years?
[236:26.58]I... Like I told you a week or two ago.
[236:30.01]I can't believe it's been 10 straight years of me doing this.
[236:34.03]And that... The channel's gotten bigger.
[236:37.57]It's not gotten smaller.
[236:38.94]It's not like, oh, yeah, you know, I had a big YouTube channel, like, eight years ago, but, you know, I kind of slowed down.
[236:44.82]This shit is just growing every day.
[236:47.26]It's crazy.
[236:48.66]I can't believe that I've been doing this for this long, and there are still this many people fucking here.
[236:53.24]It's unbelievable to me.
[236:56.13]I was assuming that, at some point, people would, like, lose interest.
[237:09.19]all I can do is just continue to try to do things that I think are fun and hopefully you think they are too and that's it that's all I'm doing I didn't really try to do anything else it's always kind of been like that so whatever let's just go until we can't give me why would you pass it
[237:41.94]That's a gold medal.
[237:54.54]Go until your fly is down.
[237:55.92]You're still going to do the battleship tournament with Ludwig.
[238:10.93]I think that's the plan.
[238:16.11]I think, um... Ludwig had a bunch of stuff going on recently.
[238:24.56]So I think the idea was maybe in, like, the next week or two we set it up and get it going.
[238:31.18]Try to get a bunch of people.
[238:32.10]I guess he wants to get a bunch of people.
[238:34.42]I don't know.
[238:35.62]We gotta figure out what the plan is.
[238:38.83]Apparently he wants to do a tournament.
[238:43.81]I'm gonna do one more event and then we'll, uh, before I call it.
[238:47.74]I don't want to play a second time.
[238:51.44]Networking Andy.
[238:52.44]Yeah, I don't know, man.
[238:58.27]These guys are cool.
[238:59.77]I've always thought they were interesting people and thought they had cool streams.
[239:11.72]Like, that's the shit that I kind of always wanted to do, you know what I mean?
[239:15.28]Like, look at Ludwig's recent streams.
[239:18.06]And even a guy like Mizgif, right?
[239:20.14]They're doing this interesting shit.
[239:23.35]They're trying to do more.
[239:24.79]They're trying to make Twitch a little more interesting.
[239:29.01]That's exactly what I want to do too.
[239:31.27]It's refreshing to see it.
[239:41.66]What should I do?
[239:50.81]What should I do?
[239:51.27]What should I do?
[239:54.25]I'm going to go.
[239:54.59]Let's go 100 meter.
[239:56.07]See if I can break the world record.
[240:08.40]Are you going to collab with Nyaners?
[240:09.67]There's all kinds of stuff I'd love to do.
[240:13.15]Yeah, that just freaked me out.
[240:15.21]I completely forgot he was in the game.
[240:16.45]I was like, what the hell is going on?
[240:28.10]But it's awesome to see it.
[240:29.92]I've said for years, like, oh man, Twitch, what a great place to do some interesting stuff.
[240:35.06]Oh, I wish more people would do things.
[240:36.78]I want to do cool things.
[240:39.49]I've always kind of had that mindset of like, oh, I want to try this, I want to try that, and seeing people do that, especially in the position that they're in.
[240:46.81]They're in really, really high positions of Twitch popularity and power and stuff, and they're doing this cool shit.
[240:54.34]It's like, oh, that's awesome.
[240:55.32]I'm really glad to see it.
[240:56.64]It's really cool to see.
[241:18.24]He does this only for the power.
[241:34.72]What'd that guy say?
[241:44.62]That was a good one.
[241:45.36]That was a pretty high quality one.
[242:06.15]I woke up to night terrors, but that was you.
[242:08.21]Oh my god, I'm sorry.
[242:12.97]Wait, wait, hold on a minute.
[242:14.59]Did I just- I'm so sorry.
[242:16.95]I probably just fucked up your brain for five seconds.
[242:20.06]Oh my god, I feel awful.
[242:27.78]That person just woke up screaming from a night terror, and it was me.
[242:36.04]Goddammit, I'll get it.
[242:55.87]Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, nightmare!
[243:05.66]8.6 LMAO, yep.
[243:17.21]Probably an answer to keep it down.
[243:18.25]Alright, let me try to get under 8.
[243:34.20]Should go to bed now?
[243:35.40]Yeah, well, I'll stop.
[243:36.38]This will be the last thing we do.
[243:46.24]I gotta get this burst right.
[244:01.05]That's under 7, isn't it?
[244:02.19]I mean, that's under 8.
[244:03.61]Ugh, 8.04.
[244:18.06]I'll take it.
[244:23.45]The old man needs to go to bed.
[244:27.21]We'll go twice this next week.
[244:31.08]I have a couple of things I actually really want to do.
[244:39.48]This was surprisingly not as awful as I thought it could have been.
[244:48.54]Are you going to do VR?
[244:50.16]Yeah, that's part of the plan.
[244:51.62]I broke one of the controllers though.
[244:53.26]I still haven't gotten the index.
[244:55.49]I need the index controllers at least.
[244:56.93]Alright, one game of baseball and we'll call it.
[245:05.75]Actually, VR is probably coming up relatively soon.
[245:09.07]That might be one of the next things that I do.
[245:16.48]I have so much fun in VR.
[245:23.58]What was the other mystery game?
[245:24.82]It was... That also just freaked me out.
[245:27.43]I was like, what is this guy?
[245:30.43]It was an FMV game.
[245:31.79]We'll still play it.
[245:34.75]No, it doesn't have a javelin throw or a pole vault.
[245:38.97]It's bullshit.
[245:39.92]Alright, one game of baseball, is it?
[246:03.07]Watch the fast rock climbing video?
[246:04.53]Oh yeah, we will.
[246:08.49]Oh shit.
[246:11.37]Switzerland playing baseball?
[246:13.19]Wait, is that... Is that out of the ordinary?
[246:16.72]Does Switzerland have a baseball team?
[246:22.78]I'm not gonna watch the pole vault video.
[246:24.50]What does this mean?
[246:38.15]Holy shit.
[246:38.81]How do I advance the runners?
[246:41.59]How do I make the runners go?
[246:42.45]I don't think Switzerland even has a baseball diamond.
[246:51.98]In the whole country?
[246:53.56]There's gotta be somewhere in Switzerland that has a baseball field, right?
[247:12.45]This guy's gonna get thrown out of third.
[247:16.63]Does America have a single cricket field?
[247:18.81]I'm sure there's some college probably that has it.
[247:20.70]There's probably some kind of private leagues that play it.
[247:36.87]You've never seen a baseball field in Germany?
[247:38.89]Really?
[247:44.56]Why would you go home?
[247:45.46]Throw it to first base.
[247:51.00]That ends the inning.
[248:04.97]A-spell's only popular pretty much in America.
[248:06.74]I... South America...
[248:13.14]It's huge in South America and Japan.
[248:17.30]It's like one of the biggest things in Japan.
[248:20.91]Korea, yeah.
[248:22.13]South America.
[248:28.65]Some of the best baseball players to ever live are from South America.
[248:40.34]Good play.
[248:43.12]American Republic?
[248:43.82]Oh yeah, it's huge over there.
[248:58.34]You can charge your swing.
[249:12.58]Any San Francisco fans?
[249:15.46]I want Vegas to get a baseball team.
[249:20.82]Out.
[249:23.75]Vegas has minor league baseball.
[249:26.19]But I want major league baseball.
[249:30.89]Yeah, that's the theory too.
[249:33.27]God, how bad would it be to be a fan of Oakland sports if that happens?
[249:38.18]There was chatter.
[249:39.08]You know, first was the Oakland Raiders that were the Las Vegas Raiders.
[249:42.18]There was a little bit of chatter from my understanding of the Athletics coming to Vegas too.
[249:46.56]Can you imagine?
[249:49.78]The Oakland Athletics and the Oakland Raiders get taken and go to Vegas?
[249:53.31]That would be awful to be an Oakland sports fan.
[250:07.93]Yeah, those of you that are familiar with Vegas at all, the Rio is one of the casinos.
[250:14.38]It's kind of off the strip.
[250:16.16]It's not really on strip.
[250:17.10]It's kind of out of the way.
[250:18.96]They might demolish it.
[250:20.06]They might bring it down.
[250:21.60]And one of the theories is they might put a baseball field there and get either an expansion team or buy or transfer one of the other teams.
[250:32.37]And they would almost have everything.
[250:34.29]They would just need an NBA team at that point.
[250:38.19]Which I'm really surprised there's no Vegas NBA team.
[250:40.45]I figured that would be first.
[250:44.43]Ah, we're talking sports.
[250:45.19]It's supposed to be video games.
[250:46.15]What are we talking about?
[250:46.83]Why are we talking about boring sports?
[251:01.65]Vegas has the summer league for the NBA?
[251:03.17]I think so, yeah.
[251:06.93]I think there's a, correct me if I'm wrong, is there a WNBA Vegas team?
[251:10.91]I think there is.
[251:11.35]I'm 99% positive that it is.
[251:19.68]First down.
[251:34.88]Baseball stream is going to suck.
[251:37.17]Oh my god.
[251:38.57]No.
[251:38.99]Oh my god.
[251:39.43]No, you have no idea what that stream is.
[251:44.35]How can you tell me what your favorite ice cream is if you've never eaten ice cream before?
[251:46.79]What are you talking about?
[251:48.09]How can you say you don't like ice cream if you've never eaten ice cream?
[251:51.13]I think ice cream sucks.
[251:51.95]Have you ever eaten it?
[251:52.67]No.
[251:53.13]You have to eat it first to tell me if you like it or not.
[251:55.13]Why would that person not be running?
[252:02.42]It's a force out.
[252:03.40]Why would you not be running?
[252:17.38]Well, I'm still going to win the game, I think.
[252:22.19]Change the hit for the love of God.
[252:23.93]Hold on.
[252:24.55]I don't even... What are the controls?
[252:27.27]Swing, throw.
[252:29.59]Bunt?
[252:32.78]Steel bases, throw ball.
[252:34.56]Charge up is left bumper.
[252:52.71]I think that means charge up as in the special move, right?
[253:14.61]Do I watch the Golden Knights?
[253:16.57]No, I don't really watch hockey.
[253:18.79]I think hockey is cool, but I don't really watch it.
[253:20.47]I don't watch any sports really anymore.
[253:24.71]Guys, I haven't watched baseball since Mike Lowell was on the Red Sox.
[253:29.93]And by the way, I loved Mike Lowell.
[253:34.07]He was awesome.
[253:38.18]MVP 2007 World Series.
[253:40.38]MVP Mike Lowell.
[253:41.48]Oh my god.
[253:42.18]What a fucking legend.
[253:43.18]David Ortiz.
[253:56.00]Man, watching David Ortiz.
[253:58.03]There's no one like that ever again.
[254:00.13]There will only ever be one Big Papi, and it was David Ortiz.
[254:03.73]That's it.
[254:04.19]He was so good.
[254:07.11]In the playoffs.
[254:07.79]He has like a 700 batting average in the playoffs.
[254:10.61]Nobody else in history will ever do that.
[254:12.19]Better than Babe Ruth.
[254:13.13]He's better than Babe Ruth.
[254:14.23]Fine.
[254:14.63]Come at me.
[254:15.72]You want me to argue that?
[254:16.42]You want me to argue that Big Papi was a better hitter than Babe Ruth?
[254:21.28]I will.
[254:27.01]Baseball comes down to moments, to clutch moments, to single events in your career.
[254:32.71]David Ortiz had the most single events, the single game-winning clutch events in any player in history.
[254:40.30]Run the fucking bases, you children.
[254:42.34]Why are you not going to second and third?
[254:48.87]Big Poppy won more games with his single moments than anyone in history.
[254:54.07]Nobody cares about this dad.
[255:04.61]Charge your hit.
[255:05.43]Fuck.
[255:05.79]Okay, fine.
[255:11.90]You can charge the hit.
[255:13.18]What the hell?
[255:16.91]Jerma, no one's arguing with you.
[255:18.01]Just go back to the game.
[255:19.15]Oh, alright.
[255:24.97]I can't believe that's been a thing this whole time.
[255:26.67]0-1.
[255:55.73]That's a little dribbler.
[255:56.67]How many innings are we playing?
[256:17.14]I'm holding my big poppy foul ball right now.
[256:19.62]Are you jealous?
[256:21.30]Actually, kind of.
[256:22.14]Yeah.
[256:32.37]That sounds awesome.
[256:33.11]Are you going to show me bunt?
[256:45.13]You got to win this one for big poppy.
[256:46.90]What?
[256:52.32]He was so funny too.
[256:54.16]He was so entertaining.
[257:00.67]He always had something interesting to say.
[257:02.23]He was awesome.
[257:04.65]Big Papi is so cool.
[257:09.49]What am I doing?
[257:10.01]Why would you do that?
[257:17.08]He doesn't play baseball anymore.
[257:20.51]No, he doesn't play baseball.
[257:21.81]He's retired.
[257:22.69]He does commentary?
[257:30.79]Yeah, he does a commentary for what, ESPN?
[257:38.22]Oh god, the semifinal.
[257:39.48]Alright, I don't know if I want to do the semifinals.
[257:50.56]Stop calling him Big Poppy, it's making me uncomfortable.
[257:58.46]Okay.
[258:08.65]That's a ball!
[258:09.41]Oh, no it's not.
[258:10.63]What are these uniforms?
[258:13.03]What country is this?
[258:13.71]Is this China?
[258:22.73]Fuck.
[258:30.89]God damn it.
[258:31.39]That's gone.
[258:33.62]Home run!
[258:37.74]Home run!
[258:52.46]Let's go back to back.
[258:54.42]God, do you remember when the Red Sox, oh man.
[258:57.62]Oh, I was going to say when the Red Sox went back to back to back to back home runs.
[259:02.72]Against the Yankees in like 2008, 2009.
[259:06.52]What a display.
[259:09.82]They went back to back to back to back home runs.
[259:12.37]Holy shit, it was insane.
[259:14.63]It was unbelievable.
[259:21.44]By the way, Mike Lola was one of those guys at the plate.
[259:25.78]Mike Lola was number three, I believe, in a row.
[259:28.18]I want to watch that video.
[259:45.12]Shit.
[259:45.98]It's alright, I got 2-0.
[259:48.50]Should I watch it?
[259:49.88]Maybe.
[259:54.33]That ball is hit.
[259:55.25]That ball is gone.
[259:56.15]Number four in a row.
[259:59.66]And it's home run derby early this year at Fenway Park.
[260:03.72]Yep.
[260:04.04]I remember the exact line the guy said.
[260:05.54]Four.
[260:20.83]You guys are insulting the man's interests?
[260:23.62]I don't care if you don't like baseball, it's fine.
[260:28.76]I don't have to force you to like baseball.
[260:41.16]More like cringe ball.
[260:49.27]I left after boxing.
[261:02.33]I like baseball the concept, but not baseball the game.
[261:10.44]Make sure you watch my baseball stream.
[261:20.68]no not this one this is home run last time from this uh no yep
[261:46.56]Alright, I have a theory for you.
[261:48.16]If you guys think baseball is dumb after watching the baseball stream, okay, I'll hear your arguments, but I'm not sure that you're going to say that.
[261:55.35]You think baseball is like boring or something?
[261:57.09]Is that the problem?
[262:01.41]Talk to me after that stream.
[262:02.25]Let's go, USA!
[262:14.41]Okay, if you hold down the charge, you have to stay in the same spot.
[262:18.23]I get it.
[262:22.51]Oh, bullshit.
[262:42.11]You're creating a straw man baseball hater.
[262:46.53]No, there's at least a few people that have said that it was stupid and boring and dumb.
[262:51.76]At least two people said that.
[262:58.58]Are you going to play in the baseball stream?
[263:01.24]I'm the umpire.
[263:04.93]I am the game's sole fucking umpire.
[263:11.61]That's the only thing I'm gonna tell you.
[263:25.40]Why'd the pitcher get that?
[263:27.30]Oh my god, what are you doing?
[263:29.34]What the fuck was that?
[263:52.09]I can't wait for that stream.
[263:53.15]It's like I'm more excited for that than anything else.
[263:57.37]I really am.
[263:59.57]That stream has been done for a year and a half.
[264:03.45]Everything I wanted to do in it.
[264:04.93]All the things to implement.
[264:06.42]All the things I want to do.
[264:07.54]It was done.
[264:08.20]It was ready to go last August.
[264:11.74]We just couldn't because of COVID.
[264:13.58]And we weren't going to take that risk.
[264:16.22]So now here we are a year later.
[264:17.84]Can't fucking wait.
[264:28.72]When is it?
[264:29.32]September.
[264:30.72]I don't have an exact date for you.
[264:32.44]But... Either... Somewhere in mid-September?
[264:39.16]That's when we're maybe thinking of?
[264:40.89]Hoping?
[264:41.17]If all goes well?
[264:48.71]Don't hype it up too much like FTK.
[264:51.27]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[264:52.51]This is way different than FTK.
[264:56.86]This stream is like two years in the making.
[265:01.86]A huge amount of my mental resources and physical everything has gone to this one.
[265:12.94]FTK.
[265:19.14]The August stream is bigger than baseball.
[265:21.88]Yes.
[265:22.82]Well, I don't know.
[265:24.03]Kind of.
[265:24.59]Maybe on paper.
[265:27.92]It depends how you look at it.
[265:28.74]Shit.
[265:39.15]Nice pitch.
[265:56.32]Right down the middle.
[265:56.96]You wouldn't do that.
[265:57.82]Maybe you would.
[266:00.16]I'm winning by seven runs.
[266:09.97]You took two years to make a Minecraft baseball stream?
[266:16.73]It's not in Minecraft.
[266:17.91]One in one.
[266:31.65]It's gonna be a baseball maze.
[266:54.95]Two years of work for the worst stream of 2021?
[266:57.57]No way.
[266:59.45]No way.
[267:01.29]I can't.
[267:02.43]No way.
[267:04.41]Even if you think so, no.
[267:05.95]I disagree.
[267:06.41]Guys, I've already watched this stream like 10 times in my head.
[267:11.58]No, it's really fun.
[267:12.92]It's a really good stream.
[267:14.34]I've already watched it.
[267:14.98]In my brain.
[267:23.10]You can dive and get that ball.
[267:46.49]I win the game after this, right?
[267:51.74]Why'd you specify watching something in your brain?
[267:53.60]What do you mean?
[268:00.36]Guys, any stream idea I've ever had, I close my eyes and watch one segment of it that I think is interesting, and if I think it's funny, or if I think it's worth doing, that's why I do it.
[268:20.41]Did you watch FTK and in your mind think it was funny?
[268:24.82]Yeah.
[268:26.96]It kind of was.
[268:38.22]This still isn't over I'm just hanging out man.
[268:43.81]I'm just chillin I'm going yeah, I'm going a little longer cuz I'm I'm just hanging out But I'm not gonna talk about it anymore, I just know that I'm so excited for it
[269:10.94]I'm so excited.
[269:12.68]I'm, like, so giddy.
[269:13.76]It's unbelievable how happy I am about it.
[269:17.98]And the other one, too.
[269:18.96]I mean, I'm not even talking about the other one.
[269:22.57]That's actually a surprise.
[269:23.71]I can't really... I actually can't even talk about that one.
[269:27.17]Like, actually.
[269:28.41]So, you'll hear about it when you hear about it.
[269:37.39]I have to pretend to not be excited for the one in August.
[269:41.96]So I don't start talking about it.
[269:43.38]Or like ruin it.
[269:44.40]That was a home run.
[269:49.84]Oh shit.
[270:03.87]Grab.
[270:06.11]Turn auto off.
[270:08.35]Auto defend is... Why would that even be a thing?
[270:19.89]Where's the motherfucking merch?
[270:21.51]I know, I just... I never do it.
[270:28.34]Oh, there is merch coming, actually, if you want to call it that.
[270:32.00]Grotto Beasts is coming.
[270:34.69]Another thing, like, August... There's just so many things in August and September.
[270:38.05]Like, I can't even...
[270:51.10]And in there.
[270:56.79]I know that the last 30 minutes of the stream has been me going, oh my god, I can't wait for that stream.
[271:00.79]I can't wait for this stream.
[271:01.79]Oh, I can't wait for that stream.
[271:02.67]I can't wait for that.
[271:03.51]Oh my god, I can't wait.
[271:04.29]I'm not giving you very many details.
[271:15.39]That's in there.
[271:16.09]Give me a break.
[271:21.56]Give us a hint?
[271:22.22]No, I can't.
[271:24.73]No hints for the other stream.
[271:39.03]Finally, I can see the bases.
[271:49.49]Oh, he was ready for that one, but the thing was out of bounds.
[271:59.92]This guy's following me around everywhere.
[272:04.46]How can he even do that?
[272:16.44]Yeah.
[272:18.38]Yes or no, will we ever see Catboy Jerma again?
[272:20.54]Yes.
[272:22.88]It has nothing to do with the thing in August or September.
[272:34.69]Oh shit, I can do that.
[272:41.75]Fuck, that's a three run home run.
[272:58.30]We need proof of auto.
[273:01.33]I'll show auto next weekend.
[273:04.72]I'll do a mini auto stream next weekend, okay?
[273:06.73]Does that sound good?
[273:15.81]I gotta get some runners on base.
[273:16.79]Here we go.
[273:20.48]Start it off.
[273:20.84]USA!
[273:34.47]Ugh, get in there.
[273:36.77]Dammit.
[273:39.75]Why's the catcher running all the way down the first baseline?
[273:49.64]Get outta here!
[273:51.20]One-run game.
[274:04.88]Are you streaming late to get your subs back?
[274:07.44]No.
[274:07.68]I don't even know how many subs I have right now.
[274:13.58]It's in there.
[274:16.11]No, I'm streaming because I... I haven't streamed in like 10 days.
[274:20.45]And I'm having fun.
[274:33.50]I'm having a good time.
[274:37.58]Oh!
[274:44.30]Whoopsie.
[274:44.92]That was weird.
[274:57.15]They freaked me out.
[275:06.80]Mini auto stream.
[275:10.05]Nominated for stream of the year.
[275:11.11]I don't know about that.
[275:13.91]What about the JermaCraft server?
[275:22.16]Yeah, that's another thing too.
[275:27.72]I'm in that zone right now where...
[275:30.77]Two or three projects have taken over everything.
[275:34.40]And some of the other projects that were smaller, but not still very important.
[275:39.30]They kind of fell off the truck a little bit.
[275:48.10]But no, that is still happening.
[275:49.62]Yeah, I still want to do it.
[275:52.20]It's pretty much done.
[275:52.84]There's just some fine-tuning that has to be done to it.
[276:08.08]Alright, now the whole thing's getting thrown.
[276:09.56]Now this is getting out of reach.
[276:10.89]Give me a Grand Slam to end it.
[276:29.02]Damn it.
[276:36.75]Oh!
[276:39.05]Oh well.
[276:40.37]I got another chance right here.
[276:41.21]Goodbye.
[276:50.30]Grand slam.
[276:52.76]Now I know it's pretty much guaranteed.
[277:11.91]that's fine this is the end of the game here I just gotta put it down you're shirtless aren't you yes I am this is my chest that's my chest you can tell because you can hear my voice changing this is my neck area you can tell this is my stomach see
[277:43.14]Don't let them score.
[277:44.01]It's six runs in one inning.
[277:52.37]Why didn't you just say yes?
[277:53.25]Because I had to prove it.
[278:01.48]Shit.
[278:06.70]That was some little league shit right there.
[278:20.69]I think I got that grand slam because I'm really going to need it.
[278:28.18]Oh my god, dude.
[278:29.44]Come on.
[278:30.46]Can I take this pitcher out?
[278:31.44]He's so tired.
[278:41.37]Oh, shit.
[278:43.95]Oh, man.
[278:44.45]This is not good.
[278:46.85]Not if it's only a two-run game.
[278:53.24]There's no outs.
[278:54.32]Oh, God.
[279:09.53]There we are.
[279:09.97]Alright.
[279:10.63]Let's pull this back.
[279:12.01]No more bullshit.
[279:18.36]There we are.
[279:18.78]Alright.
[279:19.02]Come on.
[279:19.74]One, two, three.
[279:31.72]Alright, now I'll use a special pitch.
[279:36.92]Because I want to be able to clinch the win here.
[279:42.40]I win.
[279:42.90]Nice.
[279:44.46]They made it interesting.
[279:45.22]I'll give it to them.
[279:55.39]That's kind of weird what we're watching.
[280:00.09]Alright.
[280:00.45]That's going to be it.
[280:05.47]That was Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games featuring Sonic the Hedgehog.
[280:13.94]Not the other one that you've played.
[280:14.90]So I will see you guys on Thursday and then Saturday or Sunday, depending on how we go.
[280:24.82]So, expect Thursday and then Saturday.
[280:27.09]Or Thursday and Sunday of this coming week.
[280:30.71]Sorry I was gone for an extra three plus days.
[280:33.65]That was not my intention.
[280:35.83]But, it's good to see you.
[280:39.59]Have a fantastic rest of your evening.
[280:42.16]I'm going to show the... Not that.

[281:03.91]Speed climbing.
[281:07.50]World record.
[281:08.96]6.2 seconds.
[281:11.94]Is this the one?
[281:12.38]This is 6.2 seconds, but this is 10 years ago.
[281:19.67]Is there a new one?
[281:20.21]There's a new one.
[281:27.44]Speed climbing record.
[281:31.23]New speed climbing, 5.2 seconds.
[281:34.69]I want to watch this.
[281:35.51]I'm very curious about this.
[281:43.93]I'll get it on there after the credits.
[281:44.95]Am I going to get DMCA'd?
[281:49.33]I don't know if I'm going to have a speed climbing video.
[281:51.75]I don't know if I would do that.
[282:04.55]Basecam reaction?
[282:05.71]No, I'm naked.

[282:25.94]Oh, fuck.
[282:26.36]Why did that get canceled?
[282:29.64]Oh, damn it.
[282:31.98]Did I break it?
[282:32.67]No, that's alright.
[282:39.03]It skipped me?
[282:39.73]No, it'll get you.
[282:40.45]It'll get you.
[282:40.85]I just have to redo it.
[282:44.65]What was the other video?
[282:45.85]There was speed climbing.
[282:46.69]No, no, I'm not the pole vault.
[282:48.24]I'm not doing that one.
[282:49.48]You can watch that on your own time.
[282:53.10]It's fucking horrible.
[282:54.68]It's so awful and painful looking and oh my god.
[283:00.48]Oh, the Red Sox home runs.
[283:01.30]That's right.
[283:01.71]Yep.
[283:05.21]Red socks go back to back to back to back.
[283:14.49]Yeah, this is it right here.

[288:09.64]Oh, what's that?
[288:10.26]Another one.
[288:10.52]That one is hit deep.
[288:11.88]J.D.
[288:12.28]Drew has gotten a hold of one.
[288:14.08]On its way and out of here.
[288:16.38]Into the bleachers.
[288:17.82]Oh, who's coming up next?
[288:19.84]Mike Lowell.
[288:21.06]And this game is going to be tied up.
[288:22.98]That one's headed for New Hampshire.
[288:24.52]By the way, this is each batter after the other.
[288:26.76]Back to back to back to back to back.
[288:28.10]And they're playing home run derby early this year at Fenway Park.
[288:32.75]Who's next to that?

[288:40.83]Number four in a row.
[288:42.13]And the Red Sox win.
[288:46.76]I don't think you guys understand how rare this is to do.
[288:54.76]And how impossible this is.
[288:58.26]Let me watch Mike Lowell's fucking incredible bat.
[289:00.40]I love how he swings the bat.
[289:01.72]Yeah, it's such a beautiful swing.
[289:03.30]Look at that.
[289:04.27]Look at how he swings his bat.
[289:15.26]Oh, I love it.
[289:21.51]Alright.
[289:21.75]The gray monster is a gimmick.
[289:22.73]Ban that guy for at least an hour.
[289:25.23]It is.
[289:25.51]It is.
[289:25.89]But ban him.
[289:28.33]Alright.
[289:28.53]That was fun.
[289:29.09]I'll see you guys later.
[289:32.54]I do this in Mario baseball all the time.
[289:34.22]It's really easy.
[289:43.65]Alright, goodnight guys.
