[00:18.06]Hello.
[00:27.06]Huh...
[00:32.59]We're gonna, uh, we're gonna chill for a minute.
[00:35.99]We're gonna hang out for a few minutes.
[00:41.05]I'm just gonna go back to the town.
[00:42.03]And just hang out in the, uh, in the store or something.
[00:46.92]I want to grab a drink and everything, so I'm not really starting yet.
[00:51.08]Just getting going, you know?
[00:52.30]And I forget where the hell I am. ...
[01:02.80]Oh, I've already got in a fight.
[01:05.95]I don't know.
[01:07.63]Sunderplane?
[01:08.89]Gets in the way hot on purpose.
[01:10.75]Not on purpose or anything.
[01:11.85]Can I approach the plane?
[01:17.83]You get close to Sunderplane, but not too close.
[01:21.03]Be a human?
[01:23.23]What does green mean again?
[01:24.01]Doesn't green mean something?
[01:25.37]I kind of forget.
[01:28.77]Accidentally bumps you with its wing.
[01:31.89]I'm gonna flirt with the plane.
[01:34.55]You tell it it has nice turbines.
[01:37.02]You sicko.
[01:44.18]Sunderplane gives you a condescending barrel roll.
[01:47.94]Approach it again.
[01:50.17]Not too close.
[01:53.41]Hmm.
[01:55.89]What did I get?
[01:56.53]Oh, oh, oh, okay.
[01:57.69]Alright, alright.
[01:59.90]Alright, I got a little too close.
[02:02.30]I got a little too close.
[02:05.64]Let's do it.
[02:09.82]Oh, starting to really... I did it.
[02:12.07]Smells like an airport perfume counter.
[02:15.37]You have been sped.
[02:16.53]Yeah, I remember green was something.
[02:20.51]It's like green is good.
[02:22.13]Green heals you.
[02:22.81]Alright, I'm gonna... We're not really starting yet.
[02:28.68]I'm just trying to get back to... I actually don't even really need to do what I'm doing.
[02:33.87]I'm gonna chill here while I grab a drink.
[02:37.83]So... Yeah.
[02:40.13]Just chill.
[02:41.21]Hang out.
[02:43.17]Watch Snarr play Mario Maker for the time being.
[02:46.33]I need to get some stuff.
[02:47.25]I need to get some snacks.
[02:48.59]I gotta make sure I'm, like, ready to go.
[02:49.77]I gotta get some apple cider.
[02:53.16]Which is important.
[02:55.76]Why am I level 6?
[02:57.78]I don't know.
[02:58.28]You think I know?
[03:01.32]I'll explain it when I get back.
[03:05.91]It's time to get a drink.
[03:07.35]Hey, hey, you know what I have to say about that?
[03:09.09]Hey, bottoms up, boys.
[03:11.45]Yeah, okay.
[03:16.27]Ooh, that's like manna.
[03:18.13]That was like a manna potion.
[03:20.75]Alright, I'll be back in a few minutes.
[03:25.15]I don't have my BRB screen, so...
[03:28.00]I don't fucking know.
[04:02.53]Thank you.
[04:40.28]It feels great in this room.
[04:50.92]So I'll tell you the heater story.
[04:52.45]It's not really a story.
[04:54.67]I just got this new space heater down here and it works really well.
[05:01.35]I can keep the thing at 70 degrees, like, put it on 70, it stays at 70, and it's great.
[05:05.35]The one fucking problem, and it's a pretty big problem, the room just smells like celery.
[05:11.87]The whole time.
[05:12.92]The entire time this is going, it smells like somebody's cooking celery in the room.
[05:20.28]It's not really gross, it's just odd.
[05:24.94]I got a fucking celery heater.
[05:27.70]Hey, hey, buddy, bottoms up, you know what I'm... Yes, I'm saying.
[05:35.09]Alright.
[05:36.43]So, to preface what's going on here.
[05:39.83]This is my first time ever playing this game.
[05:42.71]So, I don't know anything about anything.
[05:46.33]I killed Toriel in the very beginning.
[05:48.21]Because I just didn't... I thought it was like a fucking RPG.
[05:50.03]I had no idea.
[05:51.63]So, sorry.
[05:53.37]I apologize if I wasn't supposed to do that.
[05:56.57]But, I'm playing very neutral.
[05:59.87]So, I'm...
[06:01.73]I'm not trying to be a pacifist or kill everybody.
[06:04.09]I'm just playing the game neutrally.
[06:05.53]Right?
[06:07.75]So, with that being said, I'm not going to be paying attention to chat.
[06:11.05]Because a lot of people like to spoil shit.
[06:13.85]So, I'm not going to be doing that.
[06:17.58]So, let's go.
[06:19.68]You monster.
[06:21.08]I didn't know.
[06:21.70]There was no way for me to tell that that was a bad idea.
[06:25.80]Okay.
[06:29.82]I hate using the phone.
[06:30.94]I don't want to do this.
[06:32.34]Elevate.
[06:36.00]There's an arrow going that way.
[06:38.40]We're in a fight.
[06:40.23]Pyrrope bounds towards you.
[06:47.63]Heat up.
[06:49.39]You crank up the thermostat.
[06:51.09]Pyrrope begins to get excited.
[06:53.49]Hot, hot, hotter.
[06:56.00]Oh, whoa, that was like homing missile.
[06:59.48]He's got bombs?
[07:00.78]What?
[07:02.88]Pyrope wants more heat.
[07:04.27]Well, I'm gonna give it to him.
[07:06.57]Crank it up.
[07:10.03]Ooh.
[07:10.15]What does that mean?
[07:11.27]What does that mean?
[07:13.33]Can I go through it?
[07:15.15]I don't know.
[07:15.49]I had no idea what the hell was just happening.
[07:19.22]Well, I can spare him.
[07:27.81]It was an hour ago.
[07:28.37]I don't know if I'm going to use that arrow.
[07:30.01]I'm going to go this way for now.
[07:30.91]Oh, I have to go that way.
[07:34.21]Is there another town coming up here soon?
[07:35.63]I feel like I'm playing Ricochet.
[07:42.31]Oh my god, I've had my claw over the last digit for five minutes.
[07:47.25]Oh my god, I'm just going to do it.
[07:48.35]I'm just going to call.
[07:50.15]She's going to call me, right?
[07:54.64]Hopefully she calls me.
[07:57.17]Oh my god, who could it be?
[07:59.81]Whoever was calling hung up before you answered it.
[08:02.29]Stop being so shy!
[08:03.17]Do I want to go this way?
[08:05.97]I don't know, sure.
[08:09.25]Watch out for the fucking Ninja Turtle Technodrome.
[08:12.87]Uh, hi, so the blue lasers, uh, I mean, Alfie's here.
[08:18.15]The blue lasers won't hurt you if you don't move.
[08:21.49]orange ones, um, you have to be moving.
[08:24.45]And they, um, they won't, um, move through those ones.
[08:30.07]Spit it out.
[08:31.83]Uh, bye.
[08:36.87]Am I saying her name wrong?
[08:38.69]Is it not Alfies?
[08:40.52]Or is it like Alfo, Alfias, or Alfwy?
[08:44.72]Whatever.
[08:46.40]Oh my god, will you fucking stop?
[08:48.14]Get off of Facebook.
[08:52.98]I'm getting sick of your status updates.
[08:55.92]Blue laser.
[09:00.02]Okay, thank God that when she's doing the status updates, I won't get hit by the... I got it.
[09:04.39]Alphys?
[09:05.45]Whatever.
[09:05.73]This is a good song.
[09:11.35]Are you fucking serious?
[09:12.19]I really thought I didn't get hit by that.
[09:15.95]What the fuck is going on here?
[09:25.31]It's kind of hurting my brain.
[09:26.29]Fuck.
[09:32.37]What does this button do?
[09:35.53]It's a switch.
[09:36.81]You always press the switch.
[09:38.19]Always.
[09:38.53]Oh, well, that's good.
[09:41.96]Can I heal?
[09:43.64]Oh, shit.
[09:46.50]Is the instant noodles a full heal?
[09:49.42]I don't know.
[09:52.04]We just can't... Just stop getting hit.
[09:53.26]We'll be fine.
[09:56.15]Oh my god, I forgot to tell them where to go.
[09:57.87]I better not be going the wrong way.
[10:00.99]Cute pic of me right now.
[10:02.63]It's a photo of a garbage can with several pink glittery filters over it.
[10:09.10]We're talking comedy!
[10:11.02]Uh oh.
[10:13.04]Oh, Alfie's here!
[10:16.16]The northern door will stay locked until you solve the puzzles on the right and left.
[10:20.71]Hold on, I gotta... I gotta remember this.
[10:23.25]Solve the puzzles on the right and left.
[10:25.23]The door up top will open.
[10:27.63]Go to the right first.
[10:30.56]Now I'm going to listen to her.
[10:32.46]Up, left, down, right.
[10:35.92]Woohoo!
[10:39.04]Uh-oh.
[10:40.70]Two new characters I haven't seen before.
[10:42.48]Who's this?
[10:44.62]The way to work is blocked, so I had time to catch Mettaton's show on my phone.
[10:49.04]The special effects were amazing today.
[10:50.72]That human almost looked real.
[10:53.87]Look at Adam.
[10:55.44]Alright, what about coffee guy?
[10:57.80]Mettaton?
[10:58.32]Yeah, he's the most popular star in the underground.
[11:00.94]His fan-compliance is at least two, no, three... Alright!
[11:06.18]Oh my god.
[11:11.09]Just give me the answer.
[11:13.39]You know what I mean?
[11:13.85]Like, why can't you just text me the fucking answer?
[11:18.21]The door leading through the area is closed, so I tried the puzzle.
[11:22.25]But I kept running out of ammo, and it kept restarting.
[11:26.00]And my two co-workers won't help.
[11:28.55]It's like they don't even want to go to work.
[11:31.53]Is this a floating fox head with sunglasses on?
[11:36.87]There's a note.
[11:38.85]Gotta read the note.
[11:39.35]Always read the note.
[11:40.82]Shoot the opposing ship.
[11:42.60]Move the boxes to complete your mission.
[11:51.50]Uh, okay.
[11:53.99]Until... They... That?
[11:59.87]Oh, oh, I get it, I get it.
[12:00.85]Huh?
[12:08.74]Oh, shit!
[12:09.46]Oh, the ship, not the boxes.
[12:11.22]I thought it was... I thought it wanted me to shoot the things.
[12:16.64]Oh, dear, this is gonna fucking kill me.
[12:22.83]I didn't sign up for this.
[12:24.92]Yes, I killed Toriel.
[12:26.34]I did.
[12:26.70]And I will give you the next... Before we go any further, I need to explain this every single time I stream this game, which has been two times.
[12:34.36]So, bear with me for a second, the guys that have already heard this story.
[12:39.21]In the very beginning of the game, the first character you meet is that flower, who's an asshole.
[12:43.87]Tells you don't trust anybody.
[12:45.05]Tells you everyone's mean.
[12:46.85]Oh, I'm gonna trick you.
[12:47.85]Oh, you got tricked by me.
[12:49.82]The second character you meet...
[12:52.07]I thought was trying to trick me.
[12:53.57]I thought it was like some crazy lady that was gonna chop me up and eat me for fuckin' dinner tomorrow.
[13:00.11]You know what I mean?
[13:05.69]Oh.
[13:06.41]Oh God, what the fuck am I doing?
[13:09.65]But that's the explanation.
[13:10.41]I just, I thought, I was told not to trust anybody, so I didn't.
[13:14.91]Wait, does he have anything else to say?
[13:17.54]Wow, you solved it.
[13:18.90]I'm impressed.
[13:19.90]You must be a total nerd.
[13:22.73]I kind of am.
[13:26.38]You got tricked by the fake trick.
[13:29.90]What about you guys?
[13:30.64]Go back to work.
[13:33.76]No, it's not blocked anymore.
[13:35.46]You guys can go back to work.
[13:38.06]Hey, and take your fucking latte-looking friend with you.
[13:41.80]See?
[13:43.12]He's got like a latte.
[13:44.22]What is that?
[13:44.58]Is that a latte?
[13:45.50]Looks like it.
[13:50.37]Alright, she said right, then left, and then we go up.
[13:55.07]Should I wait for it?
[13:57.29]Shit.
[14:01.65]There we go.
[14:07.91]Alphys here.
[14:08.45]That blue laser seems totally impassable.
[14:11.44]But as the royal scientist, I have some tricks up my sleeve.
[14:15.44]I'll hack into the hotland laser database and take it out.
[14:21.20]Nice.
[14:21.46]Okay.
[14:23.52]Fire girl.
[14:24.82]An octopus lady.
[14:25.74]Let's see what they have to say.
[14:28.02]Finally, someone turned off that laser.
[14:29.58]Now that we're free, we can... Well, uh... I guess we'll just keep standing here.
[14:35.21]We were hanging out when suddenly a bunch... A buncha!
[14:38.71]You know what?
[14:39.19]You know, people don't usually use that.
[14:40.65]A buncha.
[14:41.61]I like that.
[14:43.19]A bunch of puzzles reactivated out of nowhere.
[14:45.38]This is a huge problem.
[14:46.74]It rules...
[14:48.79]They've gotta cancel school over this.
[14:51.37]Not a snow day.
[14:52.38]Chill out.
[14:54.20]A couple of puzzles got reactivated.
[14:55.64]It's not like you've got a foot of snow on the ground, lady.
[14:58.32]Shoot the opposing ship with the boxes.
[14:59.92]Okay, how many shots do I get?
[15:01.50]Two.
[15:10.01]One, two.
[15:13.05]One, two.
[15:16.55]Congratulations!
[15:18.36]Now I can go up, right?
[15:19.06]I don't care what you have to say anymore.
[15:25.77]Yeah, the only boss that I killed was Toriel.
[15:28.21]Everybody else is alive, don't worry.
[15:30.99]And the only other characters I killed were, like, a couple of frogs along the way.
[15:36.63]Only, like, three frogs died in the first, like, hour.
[15:39.22]I mean, you're talking... Yeah, of course, I am, yeah, the Puzzle Master.
[15:43.42]You don't think I'm the Puzzle Master?
[15:46.63]Whatever, I'll just explain it.
[15:47.73]I already did it.
[15:49.80]Ah.
[15:51.48]I think, um... I felt the puzzles on the left and the right.
[15:55.10]They were a bit difficult to explain, but... Uh, you already solved them?
[15:59.24]Awesome.
[16:02.32]Alright, how'd I fucking... lose my number?
[16:07.85]How do I, like, delete her from my phone and, like, block her?
[16:12.69]Couple of skips, couple of jumps.
[16:14.85]Let's go.
[16:18.75]Dark room.
[16:22.05]Any secret button?
[16:22.67]Any secret hidden buttons?
[16:27.10]More like three frogs, Toriel, and a mold small he found annoying.
[16:31.50]And we don't talk about the mold small.
[16:35.50]He was annoying.
[16:37.76]It's too dark to see near the walls.
[16:41.11]Oh my god.
[16:44.15]I fucking hate this character.
[16:45.59]Can I say that?
[16:47.33]Is that bad to say?
[16:49.65]It's kind of dark in there, isn't it?
[16:50.95]Oh, don't worry.
[16:51.65]I'll hack into the light system and brighten it up.
[16:55.89]What?
[16:57.65]Oh, no.
[17:00.52]Oh, yes!
[17:01.46]Welcome, beauties, to the Underground's premiere cooking show!
[17:05.88]Cooking with a killer robot.
[17:07.94]I like this guy.
[17:10.44]Preheat your ovens, because we've got a very special recipe for you today.
[17:14.34]We're going to be making... a cake!
[17:17.53]My lovely assistant here will gather the ingredients.
[17:20.75]Everyone give them a big hand!
[17:24.03]Yay!
[17:25.95]We'll need sugar, milk, and eggs.
[17:28.03]Go for it, sweetheart!
[17:28.97]Okay, we're gonna give you the egg.
[17:31.59]Get the milk, get the milk.
[17:33.11]You found the milk?
[17:33.76]Okay, take it.
[17:36.04]Uh, sugar.
[17:37.12]And where are the eggs?
[17:39.46]Where are the eggs?
[17:39.94]There they are.
[17:41.88]Okay, what else?
[17:44.46]Uh, wait.
[17:45.84]Okay.
[17:47.02]Hand it in.
[17:49.06]Great job.
[17:49.58]Just put them in the middle of this counter.
[17:53.55]Perfect.
[17:54.25]Great job.
[17:54.71]Beautiful.
[17:55.65]We've got all the ingredients we need to make the cake.
[17:58.67]Milk, sugar, eggs.
[18:01.15]Oh, my.
[18:01.97]What a magnificent moment.
[18:03.87]How could I forget?
[18:04.73]Wait.
[18:05.31]About this moment.
[18:06.05]I said it wrong.
[18:07.49]We're missing the most important ingredient.
[18:10.19]Ah.
[18:12.46]The human soul!
[18:15.32]This guy's fucking nuts.
[18:16.96]Get... Hello, I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
[18:25.32]Oh, I thought that was her talking.
[18:28.10]Wait, wait a second.
[18:29.06]Couldn't you make a... Couldn't you use a... Couldn't you make a substitution in the recipe?
[18:35.08]A substitution?
[18:35.92]You mean use a different non-human ingredient?
[18:38.86]Why?
[18:39.24]Uh, what if someone's... vegan?
[18:44.70]Vegan?
[18:46.34]Uh, well, that's a brilliant idea, Alphys!
[18:48.98]Actually, I happen to have an option right here.
[18:51.70]Midbrand Always Convenient Human Soul Flavor Substitute!
[18:54.89]A can of which is just over on that counter.
[18:57.21]Go get it.
[18:58.99]You prick.
[19:03.59]Well, darling, why don't you go get it?
[19:06.35]I don't trust you.
[19:07.05]I don't trust you, you fucking... Give me that cheese.
[19:10.49]Give me that cheese on that table.
[19:13.61]See, I'm gonna get drafted.
[19:14.52]Hold on.
[19:14.76]Can I, like, burn... Can I, like, burn him down with the stove?
[19:16.96]He doesn't even have the oven preheated?
[19:20.32]What a fucking scrub.
[19:25.14]Who doesn't preheat the oven?
[19:27.15]Wow, what a non-chef.
[19:31.67]Watch this.
[19:31.99]I'm gonna get hit by a train right here.
[19:33.61]Ready?
[19:35.00]Here we go.
[19:35.46]Here comes the train that's gonna run me over.
[19:38.30]Told you.
[19:40.42]By the way, our show runs on a strict schedule.
[19:42.92]If you can't get the can in the next one minute, we'll just have to go back to the original plan.
[19:48.28]So better start climbing, beautiful.
[19:51.30]Got one minute.
[19:52.76]Oh my fucking god.
[19:54.50]Not enough time to climb up.
[19:56.76]Fortunately, I might have a plan.
[19:58.12]When I was upgrading your phone, I added a few features.
[20:01.79]See that huge button that says jetpack?
[20:04.03]Yeah, watch this.
[20:07.01]Yay.
[20:12.29]Cool.
[20:17.16]You should have just enough fuel to reach the top.
[20:19.56]Now, go get that.
[20:23.50]Oh, it's not- it's not- Can I shoot him?
[20:26.95]No, I just have to avoid everything?
[20:30.57]Don't you know the strat- oh fuck, I was gonna just- I was- I just got- I put my foot in my mouth there.
[20:35.61]I was gonna say the strategy is always never move.
[20:38.44]Don't ever move.
[20:39.24]Is he just dumping the ingredients on me?
[20:44.10]What are those, breadcrumbs?
[20:46.12]Where did he get the breadcrumbs?
[20:50.33]Shit.
[20:58.89]The breadcrumbs.
[21:02.76]Here comes the flour.
[21:04.06]Okay, what's the matter?
[21:09.70]Did I do it?
[21:10.75]I did it!
[21:12.43]My, my.
[21:13.11]It seems you've bested me, but only because you had the help of the brilliant Dr. Alphys.
[21:18.73]Oh, I loathe to think of what would happen to you without her.
[21:22.36]Well, toodles!
[21:25.41]Oh, yes.
[21:25.97]How about that substitution?
[21:27.71]Haven't you ever seen a cooking show before?
[21:29.47]I already baked the cake ahead of time, so forget it.
[21:33.06]I already used a person and they're dead.
[21:38.90]Wow, we did it.
[21:40.66]We really did it.
[21:42.08]Great job out there.
[21:44.24]No, okay, I can't hear you.
[21:45.28]I'm losing, like, reception.
[21:46.62]I can't really hear you that well.
[21:49.88]God.
[21:50.62]Wait, is there anything else I can do in here?

[22:25.13]What is this?
[22:27.79]Alright, let's go.
[22:37.33]An ominous structure looms in the distance.
[22:39.33]You're filled with determination, as always.
[22:49.17]Please don't tell me this happens for the rest of the game.
[22:53.67]See that building in the distance?
[22:54.93]That's the core, the source of all power for the underground.
[22:58.45]Converts geothermal energy into magical electricity by, uh, anyway, that's where we're going to go.
[23:04.41]In the core is an elevator directly to Asgore's castle.
[23:09.16]And from there, you can run for president in 2004.
[23:11.64]Okay.
[23:11.90]Can I look at it or something?
[23:24.30]r1 you know I feel like wasn't there another way to go all the way back like way back before this in the same fire level couldn't I have gone somewhere I could have gone somewhere whatever if I get in here what happens do I lose buttons press them please select the location left floor right floor and what am I currently on right floor one
[23:53.37]Right floor, too, I guess.
[23:55.37]Okay, well, hold on.
[24:02.55]Bottoms up, you know?
[24:03.45]That's what I'm saying.
[24:13.28]Ah.
[24:13.38]Oh, little fire guy.
[24:15.14]Hey, I'm Heats Flamesman.
[24:17.44]Remember my name?
[24:18.18]That voice sucked.
[24:21.04]That was such a bad voice.
[24:22.04]I want to fucking delete this stream.
[24:24.56]Stop streaming and stream tomorrow and do it over.
[24:26.70]Because that was so bad.
[24:27.68]That was the worst voice I've ever done.
[24:30.22]God.
[24:31.18]Okay, well, let's go.
[24:35.51]Yeah, the best song in the game.
[24:49.30]I love hot dogs!
[24:51.04]Hey, isn't it weird there's snow on that guy's roof?
[24:54.58]Guess he's just too lazy to clean it up.
[25:01.76]What the hell is this?
[25:02.50]It's a piece of silly putty with a bloody french fry sticking out of it.
[25:08.58]Toasty bun.
[25:10.98]Toasty bun.
[25:11.68]Toasty bun.
[25:15.10]Okay, well, you're a fucking weirdo.
[25:18.29]Hey, buddy, what's up?
[25:19.42]Wanna buy a hot dog?
[25:20.82]It's only 30 G. Yeah, sure.
[25:24.24]Thanks, kid.
[25:25.00]Here's your dog.
[25:26.46]Yeah, dog.
[25:27.86]Apostrophe dog.
[25:29.08]It's short for hot dog.
[25:32.14]I was holding back a burp that entire time.
[25:35.74]I didn't want to be, like, burp guy in the middle of doing that.
[25:40.06]Hey, buddy, what's up?
[25:41.21]Wanna buy a hot dog?
[25:44.86]Another hot dog, here you go.
[25:46.20]Whoops.
[25:46.86]I'm actually out of hot dogs.
[25:48.70]Here, you can have a hot cat instead.
[25:50.35]What?
[25:53.15]Hot cat.
[25:55.33]Hot cat heals 21 HP.
[25:56.63]Like a hot dog, but with little cat ears in the ends.
[25:58.95]Now that was funny.
[26:07.50]Give me another hot dog.
[26:09.81]Oh, coming right up.
[26:11.17]You really like hot animals, don't you?
[26:13.15]Hey, I'm not judging.
[26:15.13]I'd be out of a job without folks like you.
[26:17.51]What'd I get?
[26:19.37]Hot dog, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[26:22.00]Hot dog.
[26:22.50]Kills 20 HP.
[26:23.12]The meat is made of something called a water sausage.
[26:26.32]But I don't want to buy another one.
[26:27.56]Oh, I'm done.
[26:29.36]Now, fuck you.
[26:31.68]Yeah, your hot dogs are made with fillers and nitrates.
[26:34.19]I only buy nitrate-free.
[26:35.21]I like gears.
[26:40.67]Oh, dinner with the girlfriend.
[26:42.16]Ooh, it's a picture of a... I don't care.
[26:44.02]I'm so sick of that shit.
[26:45.84]CoolSkeleton95 posted a picture.
[26:48.98]Are we posting hot pics?
[26:50.46]Here is me and my cool friend.
[26:52.52]It's a picture of a papyrus flexing in front of a mirror.
[26:55.19]He is wearing sunglasses.
[26:57.13]Giant muscular biceps are pasted onto his arms.
[27:00.61]The biceps are also wearing sunglasses.
[27:06.92]LOL, CoolSkeleton95.
[27:08.16]That's a joke, right?
[27:15.49]The only joke here is how strong my muscles are.
[27:21.67]Uh oh, a fight!
[27:25.34]Sunderplane attacks.
[27:27.64]Not because its jealous Vulcan is paying attention to you.
[27:33.10]What was the Vulcan thing?
[27:34.50]Criticize?
[27:35.88]Tell Vulcan that its attacks are not helpful.
[27:38.47]No, I like you.
[27:39.39]Oh, not helping, okay.
[27:40.77]I'm about to just... I'm about to just put a sword through that Vulcan's face.
[27:44.69]You know what I mean?
[27:46.91]Vulcan stands in the corner.
[27:47.97]I know how to deal with the plane, right?
[27:50.35]You approach and then you flirt with the plane.
[27:52.69]And you touch the plane.
[27:54.11]You barely don't touch.
[27:55.09]There.
[28:00.18]Get out of here.
[28:01.34]Does not help.
[28:01.98]I don't know.
[28:02.40]I'm...
[28:07.71]completely intentional alright Vulcan I'm gonna give you like a hug and if you don't like it if you like don't or no encouragement you tell Vulcan it's doing a great job but attacks become extreme that's my best oh boy I'm about to I don't I don't kill very often but you I don't something about you oh good thing good thing I don't have to
[28:38.23]Left or down?
[28:38.77]Left or down?
[28:39.37]We're gonna go down.
[28:44.20]Naps2Bluke22 has sent you a friend request.
[28:47.48]Accept the request.
[28:50.06]Who is that?
[28:51.34]Naps2Bluke?
[28:52.18]I don't know.
[28:55.21]How would I react to this if I was actually on Facebook or something?
[28:58.83]A random friend request?
[28:59.89]I'd be like, I don't think I know you.
[29:01.45]Wait, what school did you go to?
[29:05.08]You could just be like a bot trying to get my credit card information.
[29:08.42]Well, accepted.
[29:10.46]Seems to have already rejected itself.
[29:15.18]What is this?
[29:15.54]There's an apron lying on the ground.
[29:18.56]Will you take it?
[29:20.03]Yeah.
[29:21.83]Stained apron.
[29:22.29]You take everything in RPG games, always.
[29:24.39]Somebody will buy it.
[29:25.05]You know what I mean?
[29:27.55]Some stupid idiot will buy this.
[29:35.28]Alright, so now we, again, I want to reiterate one more time that we've been going for a while.
[29:41.96]I, this first playthrough ever, I have no idea what's going on.
[29:46.24]I don't want to be told what to do.
[29:47.66]I don't want to be told where to go because I'm not paying attention that much to chat because I don't want anyone to be like, oh, wow, too bad you missed it.
[29:54.12]The final thing that happens in the game, you know what I mean?
[29:56.08]I'm not going to pay attention.
[29:59.76]I glance over from time to time, but, you know, bear with me, you know.
[30:07.02]I know who it is.
[30:07.68]This puzzle is kind of timing based.
[30:10.56]Do you see those switches over there?
[30:13.18]You'll have to press all three of them within three seconds.
[30:16.18]I'll try to help you with the rhythm.
[30:19.47]Rhythm.
[30:23.05]Oh my fucking god.
[30:30.63]Press the third.
[30:31.45]Get out of here.
[30:35.87]I'm doing all three of them.
[30:39.39]Even though I only need to do two?
[30:42.19]All three.
[30:42.61]What does it mean?
[30:43.72]What does it do?
[30:45.64]Nothing?
[30:52.08]Yeah, like, I'm not going for, like, a pacifist or a kill-everybody run or a specific stuff I'm doing.
[30:57.04]I'm just enjoying the game.
[30:58.10]I love the comedy.
[30:59.64]I love the... all the cool stuff.
[31:01.65]I love trying to figure out, you know, do a little puzzle into the fighting and trying to figure out what the people are gonna do.
[31:06.63]You know, yeah.
[31:07.11]That's the last time I tried to help somebody with a puzzle.
[31:09.29]Laugh my ass off.
[31:12.50]I'm just playing the game.
[31:16.95]I'm going to the bathroom so I'll be MIA for a bit.
[31:20.10]I'm sure you can handle this puzzle yourself.
[31:24.00]Sure I can.
[31:29.48]So if you stand on it, it moves.
[31:34.51]Okay, so where the hell do I need to go?
[31:37.63]I have no idea.
[31:38.21]Let's start by going like this.
[31:47.01]Did that do anything?
[31:49.59]Kinda.
[32:01.89]I did it!
[32:02.93]Fuck.
[32:03.69]I didn't do it.
[32:04.19]You know what, maybe I can just go like this.
[32:12.30]Can't I just kinda... essentially do it again, right?
[32:18.81]Won't that be reset back to normal now?
[32:21.33]No, it won't.
[32:24.07]No, it won't.
[32:31.57]I'm so bad with shit like this because I just have trouble paying attention to what's even going on.
[32:35.98]I don't think I did it.
[32:39.32]I think I have to step on it first.
[32:50.12]So it needs to be pointing towards the other way, right?
[32:53.00]So it needs to be pointing that way.
[32:54.28]What if I go up?
[33:01.06]Show off your puzzle solving iPad skills.
[33:03.04]What do you think I'm doing?
[33:05.74]So it needs to be facing the other way, right?
[33:08.22]No, like this.
[33:10.99]So it was facing right when I jumped.
[33:12.49]Remember that.
[33:24.35]Got it.
[33:27.03]You think you're the fucking puzzle master?
[33:29.83]Yeah, you thought you were a puzzle master.
[33:32.27]You came to the right stream.
[33:40.03]Microwave?
[33:42.25]Mew Mew 2 is better than Mew Mew 1?
[33:44.70]What a joke, right?
[33:51.04]I know, right?
[33:51.74]Mouse.
[33:53.44]There's a piece of cheese inside this computerized laser safe.
[33:56.60]The lasers have melted the edge of the cheese.
[33:58.38]It's stuck to the table.
[33:59.40]It has a microwave.
[34:05.21]What is with these mice?
[34:08.65]What do you do with the mice?
[34:12.55]Knowing the mouse might one day hack the computerized safe and get the cheese, it fills you with determination.
[34:19.61]I want to see one of the mice.
[34:21.77]Just come on out.
[34:22.71]Show yourself, coward.
[34:27.79]Oh my god, don't they get it?
[34:29.11]Ruins, Mew Mew's entire title.
[34:33.48]Mew Mew 2.
[34:33.90]This is making me more angry than I should be getting, right?
[34:38.42]Mew Mew Kissy Cutie 2 is neither kissy nor cutie.
[34:41.26]It's trash.
[34:41.94]Zero stars.
[34:44.81]What is this?
[34:47.09]Is this shooting?
[34:47.81]Are those tanks?
[34:51.87]Hey, you!
[34:52.75]Stop!
[34:54.69]Oh, it's the guards.
[34:56.90]We've, like, received an anonymous tip about a human wearing a striped shirt.
[35:00.44]They told us they were wandering around Hotland right now.
[35:03.62]I know, sounds scary, huh?
[35:05.60]Well, just stay chill.
[35:07.55]We'll bring you someplace safe, okay?
[35:11.37]Huh?
[35:12.25]What is it, bro?
[35:13.91]The shirt they're wearing?
[35:15.43]Like, what about it?
[35:19.00]It striped.
[35:20.10]Oh, no.
[35:20.94]Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
[35:23.26]Bummer.
[35:23.68]This is, like, mega embarrassing.
[35:27.41]We, like, actually totally have to kill you and stuff.
[35:29.97]Oh, boy.
[35:31.63]Royal Guard attacks.
[35:34.79]What if I kill one?
[35:36.39]Can I just kill one?
[35:39.65]Will you guys be mad if I kill one of them?
[35:44.47]And we'll find out.
[35:46.27]Whisper.
[35:47.31]You tell RG-01 to be honest with his feelings.
[35:51.25]Like what?
[35:52.19]I don't get it.
[35:52.77]Team attack.
[35:58.89]This is easy.
[36:00.65]Sweat pours from O2's armor.
[36:03.43]Buckling it.
[36:04.71]You clean RG-02's armor.
[36:06.37]Its cooling dirt begins to wash away.
[36:09.54]Getting warmer!
[36:17.22]Is that changing colors?
[36:19.48]O2 watches your movements.
[36:23.38]You tell RGO2 your favorite secret.
[36:26.20]Like, give us the soul, brah.
[36:28.42]I won't tell.
[36:33.93]Not that difficult.
[36:36.93]O1 stands guard.
[36:37.91]I'll clean you.
[36:41.91]You attempt to touch RGO1's armor, your hands slip off.
[36:46.64]Awww.
[36:49.21]Will one of you guys just start sweating so I can clean you?
[36:55.99]Check.
[36:57.15]Royal Guard member with shining, polished armor.
[37:00.33]Prepare to die.
[37:01.14]Hmm.
[37:04.08]Whoops.
[37:09.42]Smells like a military zoo.
[37:13.14]You tell him, aren't you going to be honest with his feelings?
[37:15.52]Like, what?
[37:16.28]I don't get it.
[37:18.36]Yeah, I don't get it.
[37:19.36]I don't understand how to make you two not want to kill me.
[37:24.18]Okay, clean him up.
[37:27.48]Wait a minute.
[37:30.11]If they like to be all clean and shiny, what if I just don't do it?
[37:32.61]You know what I mean?
[37:36.19]I don't know.
[37:39.85]We'll see.
[37:41.84]The cooling dirt washes away.
[37:43.10]Like, give us the soul.
[37:45.13]I feel like... Really?
[37:46.73]Oh.
[37:47.81]Get over here.
[37:50.39]I knew it was changing color.
[37:51.41]I knew it was changing color.
[37:52.97]I was about to say, was it changing color when I did it?
[37:56.19]Armor's coming off.
[37:56.94]Oh, don't take your armor off.
[37:58.08]Now you're getting slashed.
[38:00.32]Much better.
[38:00.86]Yeah, it is much better.
[38:02.16]You're about to get fucking slashed.
[38:06.48]Dude.
[38:06.86]Oh, what was that little fucking stupid one?
[38:10.57]You see that?
[38:13.23]Never take your armor off in a fight, are you kidding me?
[38:20.05]Should I just kill him?
[38:29.06]You tell RJ your favorite secret.
[38:30.66]Now he doesn't have his armor off.
[38:33.36]Okay, I won't tell?
[38:34.62]Really?
[38:36.66]Well... Thankfully I'm getting hit by the easiest things to avoid in the game.
[38:43.10]Give me your secrets.
[38:44.62]Tell me your secret now.
[38:45.88]I won't tell.
[38:46.38]Then he's just gonna get slashed.
[38:48.52]That's just the way it's gonna be.
[38:53.47]Sweat pours from his armor.
[38:54.93]Ooh.
[38:56.03]Really?
[38:57.71]Really?
[39:00.35]Where's the armor?
[39:03.14]I thought I could clean his armor.
[39:06.42]Fuck.
[39:07.64]I need to eat a hot dog.
[39:08.40]No, I'll eat the noodles.
[39:10.63]You remove the instant noodles from their packaging.
[39:12.91]You put some water in the pot and place it on the heat.
[39:15.49]You wait for the water to boil.
[39:16.79]It's boiling.
[39:23.43]You place the noodles into the pot.
[39:26.39]Four minutes left.
[39:41.66]Alright, two minutes.
[39:42.49]One minute.
[39:43.39]One minute, guys.
[39:47.33]The noodles are ready!
[39:48.43]Yeah!
[39:50.53]They don't taste very good.
[39:51.77]You add the flavor back in.
[39:53.41]That's better.
[39:54.65]Not great, but better.
[39:56.76]You... God.
[40:01.18]Are you fucking kidding me?
[40:04.40]I feel like I went through a lot of trouble to get those, too.
[40:10.27]Sweat pours from his armor.
[40:11.39]Clean it.
[40:13.41]Like a muscular bongo.
[40:16.34]I didn't even see that the first time.
[40:18.84]You pat his chest like a muscular bongo?
[40:24.10]Can I whisper to him now?
[40:27.36]You tell I to be honest with his feelings.
[40:29.83]I... I... Alright, I'm breaking.
[40:34.19]I gotta eat a hot dog.
[40:35.29]I gotta eat a hot dog.
[40:37.56]Dude, I can't... I can't take this anymore.
[40:42.28]Not like this.
[40:44.04]Like, O2, I like... I like like you, bro.
[40:49.00]The way you fight, the way you talk.
[40:52.48]I love doing team attacks with you.
[40:55.03]I love standing here with you.
[40:57.49]Bouncing and waving our weapons in sync.
[41:01.13]O2, I like... I wanna stay like this forever.
[41:09.59]Uh, I mean, uh, psych got you, bro.
[41:14.14]Oh, one.
[41:15.44]Yeah, bro?
[41:17.62]Do you want to get some ice cream after this?
[41:23.96]Sure, dude.
[41:24.66]Oh, one and O2 are looking at each other happily.
[41:28.92]Oh, isn't that just great?
[41:30.16]Time to kill them both!
[41:32.24]No.
[41:34.00]Go on your merry way.
[41:43.10]Oh, where were they going this way?
[41:46.40]What was I doing?
[41:49.40]Where are they going up this way?
[41:56.17]You should have killed them.
[41:57.39]They were so happy.
[41:58.25]I couldn't do that.
[41:59.03]Oops, wait.
[42:01.17]How's the human doing?
[42:02.03]I'm doing fine.
[42:02.85]Top ten shows that make you forget to do your freaking job.
[42:09.74]Man, I know, right?
[42:13.80]Another dark room.
[42:14.50]Don't even tell me there's going to be another cooking show.
[42:16.68]I have 8 HP.
[42:19.44]Do I have anything?
[42:21.27]Stained apron.
[42:21.75]Wait a minute.
[42:22.27]What is this?
[42:23.51]Stained apron.
[42:24.07]Armor.
[42:24.53]Heals.
[42:24.81]1 HP every other turn.
[42:27.15]Fuck, dude.
[42:27.73]I'm putting that on.
[42:29.37]What do I have on right now?
[42:30.81]Use.
[42:31.89]Equip the apron.
[42:33.25]If it's a cooking show, it's going to be a cooking show, right?
[42:37.44]Here come the lights.
[42:39.74]I'm getting a phone call.
[42:40.57]Okay, I'm back.
[42:41.43]Another dark room.
[42:42.99]Oh, let me turn the lights on with my super secret hacking tips.
[42:46.41]Here we go.
[42:48.03]Hmm.
[42:50.14]Uh, what?
[42:51.74]We're on a news show?
[42:53.36]Okay.
[42:54.94]Oh yes!
[42:55.79]Good evening beauties and gentle beauties.
[42:57.95]This is Mettaton reporting live from MTT News.
[43:01.51]An interesting situation has arisen in Eastern Hotland.
[43:04.79]Fortunately, our correspondent is out there reporting live.
[43:08.58]Brave correspondent, please find something newsworthy to report.
[43:12.98]Our ten wonderful viewers are waiting for you.
[43:15.00]Gotta find something.
[43:17.06]Yeah, Todd, I'm standing here with a basketball, and the new basketball team of West Stevenson High School... Basketball's a blast, isn't it, darling?
[43:25.25]Too bad you can't play with these balls.
[43:28.05]They're NTT brand fashion basketballs for wearing, not playing, stupid.
[43:32.30]You can't get rich and famous like moi without beautifying a few orbs.
[43:36.98]Report this one.
[43:38.94]No, look for it.
[43:40.79]Yeah, you know, Todd, I'm standing here with a dog, and this dog is really interesting.
[43:43.44]He's a white dog.
[43:44.40]What is a sense?
[43:45.30]It's just an opportunity for a story.
[43:46.74]It's a fucking dog.
[43:47.80]I saved the headline now.
[43:49.38]A dog exists somewhere.
[43:50.97]Frankly, I'm blown away.
[43:52.89]Report this one.
[43:53.91]No, we're not going to do that.
[43:56.36]You know, Todd, there's a fucking Bible.
[43:58.66]Oh, no, the Bible.
[43:59.48]No, the movie script.
[44:00.54]How'd I get there?
[44:01.73]It's a super-juicy sneak preview of my latest guaranteed-not-to-bomb film, Metatron the Movie.
[44:07.59]I don't know Roman numeral.
[44:09.27]Starring Metatron.
[44:10.75]I've heard that, like the other films, it consists mostly of a single four-hour shot of rose petals showering on my reclining body.
[44:20.70]Oh, but that's not confirmed, of course.
[44:23.21]You couldn't spoil my movie for everyone with a promotional story, would you?
[44:27.85]Uh, yeah.
[44:32.03]I'm gonna report on you as... You know, this guy tried to kill me like ten fucking times.
[44:39.56]Attention, viewers.
[44:40.44]Our correspondent has found a movie script.
[44:42.74]Oh, my.
[44:43.68]And it looks like it's for my latest film.
[44:45.75]Let's not keep them waiting.
[44:46.81]Let's open it up and get to the scoop.
[44:49.20]It's a bomb.
[44:50.18]Oh, that's too bad.
[44:51.18]It's a bomb.
[44:52.80]That ticking sound.
[44:53.92]That lit fuse.
[44:55.52]Oh, my.
[44:55.90]It looks like I was wrong about the movie.
[44:57.79]We definitely have a box office bomb on our hands.
[45:01.17]And it's about to blast you to bits.
[45:03.11]But don't get too excited.
[45:04.73]You haven't even seen the rest of the room yet.
[45:09.54]Candles.
[45:10.12]I should have seen the candles.
[45:12.92]I should have seen the candles.
[45:15.64]Oh my, it seems everything in this area is actually a bomb.
[45:19.00]That dog's a bomb.
[45:21.24]That basketball's a bomb.
[45:23.40]Even my words are bombs.
[45:27.48]Brave correspondent if you don't defuse all the bombs.
[45:31.24]This big bomb will blow you to smithereens in two minutes.
[45:34.87]Then you won't be reporting live any longer.
[45:37.07]How terrible, how disturbing.
[45:40.09]Our nine viewers are going to love watching this.
[45:42.95]Good luck, darling.
[45:46.89]Yeah.
[45:48.77]Yeah.
[45:50.91]Don't worry.
[45:51.38]I installed a bomb defusing program on your phone.
[45:55.60]Use the defuse option when you go to the defuse zone.
[45:59.40]Okay.
[46:01.08]Go!
[46:03.62]What?
[46:04.38]Defuse the dog?
[46:05.64]How do I do it?
[46:08.75]What?
[46:08.93]Am I supposed to kill it?
[46:11.75]Is that what I do?
[46:12.23]Great job.
[46:12.61]Okay, yeah.
[46:21.10]Did you see how I caught that shit?
[46:22.66]What the fuck happened?
[46:23.38]Extremely agile glass of water.
[46:27.65]Diffuuuuge ball.
[46:32.27]I'm missing.
[46:32.67]What am I missing?
[46:34.93]There's like two other things, right?
[46:39.57]Huh?
[46:39.69]Where are they?
[46:41.82]Where the fuck are they?
[46:42.94]Oh, there's the Bible.
[46:44.54]Shit.
[46:44.92]Okay, got it.
[46:53.27]What else?
[46:53.49]What else?
[46:53.81]Up here.
[46:54.97]Present.
[47:01.33]Is that it?
[47:01.69]Did I get them all?
[47:02.91]Great job.
[47:03.35]There's only one left at the bottom left.
[47:05.40]Thank god she had something useful to say.
[47:08.76]Thank goodness.
[47:16.22]What is this?
[47:16.72]I don't remember this.
[47:17.94]Defuse the game?
[47:22.72]Alright, 19 seconds.
[47:25.52]I did it, did I, I did it?
[47:26.24]Okay, uh, did I defuse the bomb?
[47:32.10]You deactivated all the bombs.
[47:33.52]If you didn't, I just was lazily doing that voice.
[47:37.80]I kind of, like, just gave up.
[47:39.42]If you didn't deactivate them, the big bomb would have exploded in two minutes, and now it won't explode in two minutes.
[47:45.04]Instead, it'll explode in two seconds.
[47:47.16]Goodbye, darling.
[47:49.88]Why is this guy so evil?
[47:52.06]This guy's an evil fuck.
[47:55.08]Ah.
[47:56.02]It seems the bomb isn't going off.
[47:58.36]Ring.
[47:59.56]No, that was phone ringing.
[48:03.37]That's because while you were monologuing, I fucking fixed the change.
[48:09.11]I did it.
[48:09.53]Oh no, you deactivated the bomb with your own hacking skills.
[48:14.06]Yeah, that's what I did.
[48:15.04]Oh, good.
[48:15.50]Curse us.
[48:15.92]It seems I've been foiled again.
[48:17.90]Curse you, human.
[48:18.90]Curse you, Dr. Alphys, for helping so much.
[48:21.58]But I don't curse my eight wonderful viewers for tuning in.
[48:24.87]Until next time, darling.
[48:26.55]Bye.
[48:27.35]I'll see you in about ten minutes for the next boss battle.
[48:30.93]We showed him.
[48:36.74]Yeah, I know I was kind of weird at first, but you're still weird.
[48:40.59]But I really think... Did somebody just write dank meme deleted?
[48:44.09]I don't know why I think that's funny.
[48:51.77]But I really think I'm getting more attached to you.
[48:54.89]I'm attracted to you, and I like you.
[48:57.85]So don't worry about that big robot.
[49:00.47]I'll protect you from him.
[49:02.89]And if it really came to it, we could just turn...
[49:05.85]You know, never mind.
[49:07.37]See you later.
[49:08.37]Click.
[49:13.41]So the big bomb is up here.
[49:16.85]Can I move it?
[49:19.69]I want to open it.
[49:20.19]What if there's something in here, you know?
[49:21.71]What the fuck?
[49:29.31]I just want to light it.
[49:32.01]I want to light it and I want to throw it.
[49:33.27]You know what I want to do, guys?
[49:34.07]This is what I want to do.
[49:35.71]I want to light this and throw it underneath a frozen pond and it goes like, boom!
[49:40.83]Like that video around reddit.com.
[49:42.97]Remember that video?
[49:44.30]Did you guys see that video?
[49:45.86]Wow.
[49:47.84]What am I doing?
[49:52.40]Where am I supposed to go?
[49:54.54]Always go right.
[49:57.34]Oh, Otto, what are you doing?
[49:59.62]My dog was just, what the hell was that?
[50:08.70]I thought we were done with this shit.
[50:10.93]You've been kind of quiet.
[50:13.33]Are you worried about meeting Asgore?
[50:18.57]Well, I don't worry about it.
[50:20.29]Don't worry about it.
[50:22.05]Don't worry.
[50:22.35]He'll make a movie.
[50:24.42]The king is a really nice guy.
[50:25.70]I'm sure you can talk to him.
[50:26.78]And with your human soul, you can pass through the barrier.
[50:29.92]So don't worry, okay?
[50:31.78]I don't like the... I have a stutter.
[50:33.96]So when I see it on the screen, I'm just reminded of my stutter.
[50:45.72]Did I do everything I needed to do there?
[50:54.04]Should I go to... Should I go to the next place?
[51:00.65]I don't know.
[51:03.71]Okay.
[51:07.47]Please select the location.
[51:09.55]Right floor two.
[51:10.19]Wait, where am I?
[51:13.32]Wasn't I just on right floor one?
[51:20.46]Left floor.
[51:21.40]I've never been to left floor one.
[51:24.54]I don't know.
[51:24.96]Al Gore joke.
[51:32.63]Was it subtle enough for you?
[51:34.59]Did you get it?
[51:35.05]Was it subtle?
[51:39.05]I'm just going to go to left floor one.
[51:41.26]I don't think I was on left floor one before.
[51:44.22]Master Toaster is subscribed for two months in a row.
[51:47.14]Holy shit.
[51:49.60]Oh my god.
[51:52.79]Are you fucking kidding me?
[51:53.91]Two months in a row?
[51:56.31]Thanks, dude.
[51:59.85]Yeah.
[52:00.69]Thank you.
[52:02.25]Or something along that line.
[52:09.43]I'm gonna save, even though... Where am I?
[52:14.76]What did I just do?
[52:18.02]Where did I just fucking go?
[52:21.20]I give up.
[52:22.84]I give up.
[52:23.20]I'm not playing anymore.
[52:25.31]I'm gonna stream Pac-Man.
[52:26.55]I don't need to give a shit.
[52:27.87]I'm done.
[52:29.19]Ha, got you guys.
[52:30.41]Got you.
[52:30.69]I tricked you.
[52:31.73]I tricked you.
[52:32.19]I got you guys.
[52:33.69]See, look over in the corner.
[52:34.83]Look in the corner of your room.
[52:36.25]Camera right there.
[52:37.36]Yep.
[52:38.61]Hey, got ya.
[52:39.63]Welcome to the show.
[52:49.45]This is new.
[52:54.82]This is a new place.
[52:57.60]Oh, new characters.
[53:00.66]What's this?
[53:00.96]Is it a donut?
[53:01.34]What does the sign say?
[53:02.92]I don't talk to people until I read signs.
[53:05.54]Spider bake sale.
[53:06.41]All proceeds go to Rio Spiders.
[53:09.84]Oh, a bake sale.
[53:11.23]Okay.
[53:12.31]Welcome to our parlor, dearie.
[53:14.21]Interested in some spider pastries?
[53:16.51]All proceeds go to real spiders.
[53:19.75]Yeah, looks like some sort of powerful bracelet.
[53:22.53]Wait, it's just a croissant.
[53:25.60]It's a spider donut.
[53:26.70]It looks more rubbery than usual.
[53:31.98]I ended up buying a donut.
[53:35.52]I didn't want to, but that girl, even though I told her no, she kept staring at me in this creepy way and licking her lips.
[53:42.85]Now I'm out of cash.
[53:45.13]So this person's creepy, apparently.
[53:48.49]Buy a spider donut for nine... Are you shitting me?
[53:54.70]Buy a spider cider for $9.99.
[53:56.22]I don't have that much money.
[53:58.36]What if I just say yes?
[53:59.86]I didn't have enough money.
[54:06.14]You are selling shitty donuts for 1,000 gold.
[54:09.04]10,000 gold.
[54:09.86]That's insane.
[54:14.66]I think I already did this.
[54:17.77]Offstream a long time ago.
[54:21.61]It was like the same thing and I bought one of these dumb little donuts or something.
[54:26.55]I might have even bought two of them.
[54:30.68]Maybe I can sell it online and double my money back now.
[54:36.90]What the fuck do you want me to do, lady?
[54:39.38]Your shit is way overpriced.
[54:40.94]Another one of these rooms, huh?
[54:45.00]This room is like the room we saw before.
[54:46.82]There are two puzzles to the north and south.
[54:52.06]Two puzzles to the north and south.
[54:54.20]You'll have to solve them both to proceed.
[54:57.16]Also, I'd like to say, I don't really like giving away puzzle solutions.
[55:01.14]But if you need help, just call me.
[55:03.28]Okay.
[55:04.16]Actually, wait.
[55:05.51]I have an idea.
[55:06.69]Let's be friends on Undernet.
[55:07.93]And you can just ping me when you need help.
[55:13.07]We're already friends, aren't we?
[55:14.99]Oh, how embarrassing.
[55:15.83]I signed you up, didn't I?
[55:17.83]You've been reading my post the whole time.
[55:19.56]Well, I hope you agree with me about Mew Mew 2.
[55:24.60]I don't.
[55:25.72]Sorry.
[55:26.02]We don't have anything in common.
[55:31.13]So I gotta go up and then down.
[55:39.43]guess let's go to the north puzzle first whatever it is hopefully it's not a shoot boxes game it is a shoot box game shoot the opposing should be at just one shot oh boy I hate this I I hate this my positional awareness with games like this is so bad
[56:09.50]So close so close They also like go over here except for this one, right?
[56:28.01]No, I Might I might just have to start spinning the analog I
[56:48.39]It's gonna get to a point where I'm just gonna stop fucking ripping the analog around in a circle.
[57:00.47]Shit, come on.
[57:03.25]Oh, you fuck.
[57:11.97]I'm so bad at these.
[57:13.83]It's not even funny how bad I am at this shit.
[57:16.31]Oh, I just had it.
[57:17.43]I just did it.
[57:18.20]I just fucking did it.
[57:19.68]Oh, I just did it.
[57:20.32]I just did it, and I fucked it up.
[57:21.86]I just did it.
[57:22.36]It was done.
[57:22.76]I was too busy talking shit about my own ability, and I fucking had it, and it was done, and it was over.
[57:30.00]Oh, my fucking God.
[57:31.14]I don't even remember how I did it.
[57:33.58]Not even close.
[57:34.70]I have no idea.
[57:35.52]I don't know.
[57:39.77]I don't know.
[57:49.11]I can't believe I did that.
[57:54.01]Alright, well, we're gonna be here for a while, boys.
[57:55.43]Cause I just, like, fucking can't even... Just reset the damn thing and I'll come back and do it.
[58:04.91]That's left, left, down, right, up.
[58:16.41]Oh, nope.
[58:19.52]I can't fucking believe I did it.
[58:20.62]And I just freaked out and pressed the button again.
[58:29.51]Keep losing this.
[58:38.88]Wait.
[58:52.34]Oh, my fucking brain.
[58:55.50]I was the... I'm not... I'm the puzzle master, but not when it comes to moving around fucking crates.
[59:05.16]Don't move.
[59:05.72]Don't fucking move.
[59:06.74]Do not move.
[59:08.90]Jesus.
[59:09.30]Who are these two?
[59:14.44]We got Frankahedron and Frankahedron 2.
[59:18.34]My favorite Metadon moment, trademark, is when he beats up the heel-turning villains, even if it's during what's supposed to be a quiz show.
[59:26.47]Heel-turning villains.
[59:29.83]So I have to be bad?
[59:31.05]I have to pretend to be bad?
[59:32.63]Okay.
[59:34.55]My favorite Metadon moment, right?
[59:35.60]When everything looks the baddest, he poses dramatically.
[59:39.42]Like when he's on a cooking show and the eggs don't turn out right.
[59:43.26]Huh?
[59:52.18]Okay.
[59:53.10]Well, let me forget everything that that just said in about five minutes, and I'm going to be complaining that I don't know what to do, and everyone's going to say, well, you were supposed to remember.
[60:02.02]Whoops.
[60:10.02]Whoops.
[60:12.65]Whoops.
[60:12.99]Okay.
[60:22.08]Hey, this doesn't have anything to do with guiding you, but... Hey, would you want to watch a human TV show together?
[60:31.45]It's called Mew Mew Kissy Cutie.
[60:37.49]Well, I'm going to be real here.
[60:42.17]If somebody asked me to watch a show and the name of the show was Mew Mew Kissy Cutie, I don't know if I would want to do that.
[60:53.62]I don't think I'd want to do that.
[60:56.28]Do you have a better show?
[60:58.78]Um, well, that's okay.
[61:00.28]Just thought I'd ask.
[61:01.94]But I think you'd really like it if you gave it a chance.
[61:06.80]You know, I don't, like, I'm gonna be real.
[61:08.08]I don't think I would do that.
[61:10.48]I don't think I would do that.
[61:12.96]Now, you recommend, like, Die Hard with a vengeance, too.
[61:17.54]We've got a date.
[61:21.72]You know what I mean?
[61:22.98]Or like... The Terminator.
[61:27.10]Fuck, another one of these dumb things.
[61:35.06]I already fucked it up.
[61:37.64]We gotta go this way, then that way, then this way.
[61:39.42]You fucker.
[61:46.12]That's the last one that has to move.
[61:48.80]Just fucking maybe if I like press a bunch of buttons, I'll glitch it and I'll fucking win.
[61:58.89]Is it up or down first?
[62:41.79]Yeah, this might be the easiest puzzle if you don't have, like... I have, like, spatial fucking awareness issues.
[62:47.17]Guys, I have issues.
[62:47.89]Did I just do it again and not fucking do it?
[62:50.99]I think I just did it again, didn't I?
[62:52.41]While I was, like, yelling about shit.
[63:08.46]Guys, I have issues, okay?
[63:13.55]Hehehe.
[63:51.35]It doesn't have to be that way.
[63:52.77]Slow down.
[63:53.33]Everybody slow down.
[63:54.45]Hit the brakes, okay?
[63:55.90]Hit the brakes.
[63:56.42]I see everybody freaking out.
[63:57.34]I did it.
[63:58.92]It's not like I didn't just do it.
[64:00.22]I just did it.
[64:02.96]Seriously.
[64:04.00]Everyone's acting like I need to beat the puzzle in like fucking 10 seconds.
[64:09.01]Come on.
[64:11.43]I'm the fucking puzzle master, okay?
[64:15.79]Where am I going?
[64:17.03]What did that even do?
[64:19.41]I had to go up, down, and then so I got to go right.
[64:21.46]Right?
[64:22.40]Right.
[64:23.38]Cactus!
[64:24.36]You stop to smell the flowers.
[64:26.18]Oh, what?
[64:26.70]No!
[64:28.06]No!
[64:29.76]Give me the cactus!
[64:34.28]Give me the cactus!
[64:36.44]No!
[64:37.52]I'm going to cactus again.
[64:39.26]No, I'm not.
[64:39.72]Fuck.
[64:40.02]I don't want to do that.
[64:42.06]I wasn't moving!
[64:43.64]I wasn't fucking moving.
[64:49.04]Here we go.
[64:49.28]Give me the cactus.
[64:52.02]Cactus.
[64:52.66]I'll get it.
[64:53.36]I'll get it.
[64:53.72]There's got to be something I can do here, right?
[65:01.17]Throw a fucking punch card at it.
[65:02.63]No.
[65:03.01]Oh, fuck.
[65:17.05]Let's complete this.
[65:22.53]Is it going to be... I don't want to do the Mettaton voice.
[65:26.43]I'm going to do a different voice for Mettaton.
[65:28.29]I'm tired.
[65:29.87]Changing it up.
[65:31.25]He's going to appear and he's going to... Smell cobwebs fill the air.
[65:33.77]You're filled with determination.
[65:34.67]I don't want to do the Mettaton voice again, guys.
[65:36.79]I'm sorry.
[65:39.85]This is a spiderweb.
[65:43.91]Uh-oh.
[65:44.49]Spiders.
[65:46.81]Ah, don't stand in that way.
[65:47.75]What if I do stand in this?
[65:48.53]Am I going to get grabbed?
[65:53.42]Did you hear what they just said?
[65:55.20]No, I didn't.
[65:56.84]They said a human wearing a striped shirt will come through.
[66:00.20]I heard that they hate spiders.
[66:06.00]Who told you that?
[66:11.04]I heard that they love to stomp on them.
[66:12.60]I don't stomp on spiders.
[66:14.45]Why did you get this information?
[66:16.25]It's wrong.
[66:17.75]Like to tear their legs off?
[66:20.21]This is getting weird.
[66:21.71]I'm getting slow.
[66:22.57]Should I not be going over here?
[66:24.49]Do I need to do something?
[66:25.43]Do I need like spider boots?
[66:27.61]Alright, where are my spider boots?
[66:28.81]Because I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this.
[66:31.87]No, I'm going the other way.
[66:33.95]Moving even slower.
[66:36.81]Something's going to grab me and it's going to insta-kill me.
[66:38.43]Whatever.
[66:38.85]We'll see what happens.
[66:39.51]I don't even fucking... Whatever.
[66:48.89]Oh, I'm on the spider sword.
[66:51.03]I heard.
[66:51.59]I knew it.
[66:53.49]I told you guys.
[66:54.13]I told you this was going to happen, and I knew it.
[66:56.17]There's a person here.
[66:57.71]They're awfully stingy with their money.
[66:59.53]Just a bake sale lady.
[67:03.35]Stingy with my money?
[67:04.31]Don't sell cakes for $1,000.
[67:05.48]$10,000.
[67:05.50]Sorry.
[67:05.82]I can go to Dunkin' Donuts, and I can spend 42 cents for a glazed donut.
[67:09.36]You want me to spend $10,000 for your shitty rubber-ass donuts?
[67:17.21]You think your taste is too refined for our pastries, don't you, dearie?
[67:19.87]Yeah, I kind of do.
[67:21.88]I disagree with that notion.
[67:23.68]That's fine.
[67:25.34]Your taste is exactly what this next batch needs.
[67:30.96]Oh, shit.
[67:31.66]Okay.
[67:35.28]Muffet traps you?
[67:39.92]Your money.
[67:42.69]Pay ten gold.
[67:47.03]Get me out of here.
[67:48.85]You're not getting my money.
[67:50.75]You're not gonna get my fucking money.
[67:56.08]What is purple?
[67:57.96]What is purple?
[67:58.46]What is purple?
[67:59.00]What is purple?
[67:59.48]I think purple is better to look on you.
[68:02.24]You're trapped in a strange purple web.
[68:03.96]What does that mean?
[68:09.70]You're not getting my money.
[68:11.40]You struggle to escape the web.
[68:14.54]Why so pale?
[68:15.18]You should be proud.
[68:16.20]I don't know what purple means.
[68:20.27]It means I can only move on one plane?
[68:23.51]Synchronize dance.
[68:28.79]I think it's time to start fucking smashing somebody.
[68:35.04]What about items?
[68:35.66]What about like... Can't spare you.
[68:37.68]I got hot dogs.
[68:46.78]Alright, you get 10g.
[68:49.67]Reduces her attack for this turn.
[68:51.09]Proud that you're going to make a delicious cake.
[68:53.47]So I'm on like the plane of three.
[69:01.15]Up next, two spiders.
[69:02.71]I don't know, man.
[69:12.63]Struggle to escape the web.
[69:14.63]Muffet is so amused by your antics that she gives you a discount.
[69:18.57]Let you go, don't be silly.
[69:19.57]So what does the thing in the top right mean?
[69:28.46]Is this a boss?
[69:30.34]Muffet does a synchronized dance with her other spiders.
[69:33.58]So here comes the octopus spider.
[69:38.31]Struggle to escape the web, nothing happened.
[69:40.57]Your soul is going to make every spider very happy.
[69:46.75]Eyeballs?
[69:47.19]Where do you get the eyeballs?
[69:51.52]All the spiders clap along to the music.
[69:57.40]Alright, you get 20 gold.
[70:02.35]How rude of me, I almost forgot to introduce you to my pet.
[70:04.61]It's breakfast time, have fun!
[70:18.43]Whoa, what's going on here?
[70:19.57]I feel like I'm playing like original Mario, like the Donkey Kong one.
[70:30.31]Pours you a cup of spiders.
[70:34.55]I think the money keeps going up.
[70:38.39]Ugh.
[70:43.80]Let me just look at it.
[70:44.56]I'm gonna check.
[70:45.46]If she invites you to her parlor, excuse yourself.
[70:48.55]The person who warned us about you... Gonna give me more story elements?
[70:55.61]Shit.
[70:55.87]I don't even have any heals either.
[70:58.09]Smells like freshly baked cobwebs.
[71:07.50]I don't have much.
[71:10.18]I'm not going more than 100 bucks.
[71:13.15]Reduces her attack for this next turn.
[71:14.54]Offered us a lot of money for your soul.
[71:16.68]It has to do with that.
[71:22.86]Something to do with what's going on here.
[71:24.34]The way it moves around.
[71:27.93]Otherwise, why would the fucking lines be there if it was just up and down?
[71:31.65]Tidies up the web.
[71:33.41]Yeah, 130 gold.
[71:34.75]Get out of town.
[71:35.47]Does this mean anything?
[71:43.39]Three lines?
[71:47.93]Shh, fuck.
[71:50.99]What's that?
[71:51.27]What is that, a spaceship?
[71:52.69]No, I tried to touch it.
[71:53.55]It was a fingernail.
[71:56.13]Muppet does a synchronized dance with all the other spiders.
[71:58.05]Alright, I'm gonna eat a hot dog.
[72:07.98]I swore I saw them in the shadows changing shape.
[72:17.37]I hope it has a synchronized dance with the other spider, because the parachute's coming up.
[72:24.79]I'm feeling like this parachute.
[72:31.62]You know what?
[72:32.18]Time for you to get fucking beat up.
[72:37.06]No, not the pet again.
[72:37.88]What if I let him eat me?
[72:45.08]I'm scared to do that, but, you know, sometimes you gotta do something crazy.
[72:52.71]No, that didn't do anything.
[73:01.00]I keep hearing that sound.
[73:04.06]Hmm.
[73:04.44]Hmm.
[73:18.81]With that money, the spider clans can finally be reunited.
[73:23.68]Make me some cookies or something.
[73:25.14]Anything that's not dangerous.
[73:35.29]Poise you a cup of spiders.
[73:40.27]Alright, alright, okay, fine, alright.
[73:42.64]I'll spare you.
[73:47.51]I feel like, do I just need to hear all her dialog?
[73:52.53]Maybe I can, something else will happen?
[74:04.30]Alright, you, oh my god, she's taking all my fucking money.
[74:08.44]Even if they go under the door, Snowdin's fatal cold is impassable alone.
[74:22.81]I'm about to start hitting.
[74:38.28]If I don't see any... after the dialog is over, if I don't see anything interesting, I'm going for... I'm swinging for the fences.
[74:47.60]All the spiders are clapping along to the music.
[74:49.20]Let's go.
[74:50.30]Let's see the rest of the story.
[74:52.50]And with all the leftovers, we could have a nice vacation.
[74:55.42]Or even build a spider baseball field.
[74:58.96]Isn't that interesting?
[75:05.43]Give it to me.
[75:05.85]Smells like freshly baked cod.
[75:06.93]Give it to me.
[75:07.49]Let's go.
[75:07.95]Give it to me.
[75:10.87]But enough of that.
[75:11.59]It's time for dinner, isn't it?
[75:13.73]Alright, this is the pet guy.
[75:15.97]Holy shit.
[75:20.86]Alright, here he comes.
[75:21.38]Okay, I gotta be careful here.
[75:24.52]I'm using a fucking goddamn controller.
[75:26.09]Getting stuck!
[75:33.65]Did you see that move?
[75:34.15]Did you see that move?
[75:35.41]I learned that from my fucking grandfather.
[75:37.99]You're still alive?
[75:39.31]Oh, my pet looks like it's time for dessert.
[75:41.88]What's that?
[75:42.14]What's that?
[75:42.56]Give me that.
[75:45.26]They're saying that they saw you and you helped donate to their cause?
[75:49.42]That's right, I did!
[75:50.93]This has been all a big misunderstanding.
[75:52.97]I thought you were someone that hated spiders.
[75:54.69]The person who asked for that soul, they must have met a different human in a striped shirt.
[75:59.37]Sorry if I fucking got, get beat.
[76:03.40]You can come back here anytime and for no charge at all.
[76:05.68]I gave money.
[76:06.42]I told you guys I did it.
[76:11.10]Yeah.
[76:13.38]I'll spare you now.
[76:15.20]Muffet is sparing you.
[76:17.12]Well, thank you very much.
[76:22.31]I appreciate it.
[76:27.10]Seven gold.
[76:30.34]Seven gold.
[76:35.40]Thanks for nothing.
[76:37.57]I think I gotta start making some fatalities here.
[76:40.21]Because I have no experience and no money.
[76:50.33]That was fun.
[76:51.23]See you again, dearie.
[76:55.33]Not in your lifetime.
[77:07.02]Look, I committed the ultimate sin.
[77:08.30]I killed Toriel in the very beginning of the game.
[77:11.26]So if you guys don't think I'm not hard or something, I killed Toriel.
[77:16.61]Yeah.
[77:18.63]You can quote me on that.
[77:24.63]Oh, look, it's my buddy Mettaton!
[77:28.81]Tragic tale of two star-crossed lovers kept apart by the tides of fate.
[77:33.89]Looks like it's almost time for the performance.
[77:36.41]Do I not get a... He's hard.
[77:44.16]Oh, that human.
[77:48.90]Could it be?
[77:51.64]My one true love?
[77:55.93]This game is fucking so... This game is great.
[78:01.09]The first word I was going to say was stupid.
[78:03.58]But then it turned into great.
[78:05.46]So this game is great.
[78:09.66]Oh my love.
[78:13.08]Please run away.
[78:14.08]I'm not singing this.
[78:17.28]Monster King.
[78:20.37]Forbid your stay.
[78:22.43]No, I'm done.
[78:22.83]That's it.
[78:23.19]That's all you're getting.
[78:27.03]Just putting the controller down.
[78:30.21]The fire part.
[78:33.20]Even if it needs that.
[78:36.34]It breaks my heart.
[78:41.26]They'll put you in the dungeon.
[78:44.96]They'll suck.
[78:45.52]They'll let you die a lot.
[78:57.17]Really sad.
[79:00.33]You're gonna die.
[79:02.21]And cry, cry, cry.
[79:08.34]So sad it's happening all over again.
[79:16.22]So sad.
[79:18.34]So sad that you are going to the dungeon.
[79:21.76]Well, Tootles?
[79:23.68]Huh?
[79:26.76]Is this a dungeon?
[79:28.24]No, no, whatever shall I do?
[79:29.70]My love has been cast away into the dungeon.
[79:31.70]A dungeon with a puzzle so dastardly, my paramour will surely perish.
[79:38.08]Oh, heavens have mercy.
[79:39.58]The horrible colored tile maze.
[79:41.98]Each colored tile has its own sadistic function.
[79:44.92]For example, a green tile sounds a noise, and then you must fight a monster.
[79:48.88]Red tiles will actually... Wait a second.
[79:50.98]Didn't we see this puzzle about a hundred rooms ago?
[79:54.00]That's right.
[79:54.42]Remember all the rules, don't you?
[79:56.12]Great.
[79:57.12]Then I won't waste your time repeating them.
[80:01.00]Oh, and you'd better hurry.
[80:02.76]Because if you don't get through in 30 seconds... ...you'll be incinerated by these jets of fire.
[80:13.78]My poor love, I'm so filled with grief I can't stop laughing.
[80:17.18]Good luck, darling.
[80:19.76]Oh my love, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I don't know what to do.
[80:21.76]I don't know what to do.
[80:23.24]Press this button.
[80:23.76]Press every button.
[80:24.30]I don't fucking... Press every button.
[80:26.60]Press every single button.
[80:34.20]I don't know where to go.
[80:35.15]I don't know what to do here.
[80:39.27]Can I go up?
[80:42.49]I'm gonna lose.
[80:45.25]Hold on, I'm not.
[80:45.79]I have two seconds.
[80:47.07]What happened?
[80:51.33]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[80:52.27]Looks like you're out of time.
[80:53.45]Here come the flames, darling.
[80:58.11]They're closing in.
[81:00.63]Getting closer.
[81:01.57]Oh, my.
[81:02.55]Any minute now.
[81:14.25]Watch out, it'll save you.
[81:16.75]I'm hacking into the firewall right now.
[81:19.23]Oh, I just shut it down.
[81:20.09]Oh, no, how could this happen?
[81:21.73]Foiled again by the brilliant Dr. Alphys.
[81:28.13]That's right.
[81:29.89]Come on, Minotaur, give up already.
[81:31.74]Your voice has changed five times.
[81:33.54]You'll never be able to defeat us, not as long as we work together.
[81:37.16]Your puzzle's over now.
[81:38.50]Go home and leave us alone.
[81:41.00]Puzzle over?
[81:42.30]Alphys, darling.
[81:43.46]What are you talking about?
[81:44.81]Did you forget what the green tiles do?
[81:47.41]They make a sound.
[81:48.21]Then you have to fight a monster.
[81:50.19]Well, darling, that monster is me.
[81:53.67]I just did a boss fight.
[81:54.37]Are you fucking kidding me?
[81:56.19]I have no healing or anything.
[81:57.29]This sucks.
[82:02.41]I gotta get me the hot dog.
[82:06.12]This is it, darling.
[82:06.92]Say goodbye.
[82:07.60]Is that your phone?
[82:10.88]You better answer it.
[82:14.08]Hey, this seems bad, but don't worry.
[82:15.34]There's one last thing I installed on your phone.
[82:17.46]You see that yellow button.
[82:19.64]Go to this phone's Act menu and press it.
[82:24.19]Your phone's Act menu is glowing.
[82:33.13]Yellow.
[82:34.29]You press the yellow button.
[82:35.53]The phone is resonating with Mettaton's presence.
[82:38.61]This is it.
[82:39.23]Say goodbye.
[82:40.19]Uh...
[82:45.41]You're yellow.
[82:46.85]Now press Z. Z. Just once.
[82:54.64]Oh.
[82:57.48]Oh.
[82:58.30]You've defeated me.
[83:00.26]How could this be?
[83:01.60]You were stronger than I thought, etc.
[83:04.39]I didn't see the last line, so bye.
[83:09.61]Looks like you beat him.
[83:10.93]You did a really good job out there.
[83:13.07]Oh, thanks to you.
[83:22.27]I'm starting to feel bad that I, uh, sort of treating her poorly or him.
[83:27.24]I don't even know what this character is.
[83:28.56]It's a fucking triceratops.
[83:33.24]Can I tell you something?
[83:35.48]Before I met you, I didn't really like myself very much.
[83:39.42]Okay, now I do feel bad.
[83:41.98]Now I feel real bad.
[83:44.30]Whoa, way to make me feel bad.
[83:46.88]Like I couldn't do anything without ending up letting everyone down.
[83:50.56]Now I feel fucking terrible.
[83:55.01]But guiding you has made me feel a lot better about myself, so thanks for letting me help you.
[83:59.75]Okay, I'm gonna be nice.
[84:00.85]Lisa Simpson.
[84:11.95]Anyway, we're almost to the core.
[84:13.11]It's just past MTT Resort.
[84:15.76]Come on, let's finish this.
[84:17.74]I feel bad.
[84:22.40]You can actually beat this puzzle?
[84:23.64]Really?
[84:25.65]How many?
[84:26.09]Did I miss a sub?
[84:27.35]I think I did.
[84:29.11]Damn it.
[84:30.43]Well, thank you.
[84:31.27]Thank you to anybody that just subbed in the last, like, hour and 15 minutes.
[84:36.27]I feel fucking bad.
[84:38.35]I feel bad.
[84:38.86]I'm gonna be nice next time.
[84:39.92]Oh, there's a hot dog guy.
[84:41.08]That means there's a fucking... Where's my punch card?
[84:45.16]These two fellas bought all my ice cream.
[84:46.80]I've actually sold out of everything.
[84:48.72]Sorry, wait.
[84:49.57]I've still got something for you.
[84:51.25]A big smile.
[84:52.57]How about that?
[84:55.41]That's not good enough.
[84:58.08]Oh, hey.
[84:59.10]We're, like, talking a rain check on that killing you thing.
[85:03.12]Like, don't tell Undyne about this, okay?
[85:05.64]What about your friend here?
[85:07.12]He seems happy.
[85:08.81]Oh, what's over here?
[85:11.97]Oh, it's this guy again.
[85:12.97]Hey, hey.
[85:16.27]Did you remember my name?
[85:17.19]Yeah, of course I did.
[85:20.63]What?
[85:20.99]You remember?
[85:22.17]How could I be so easily defeated?
[85:23.81]What?
[85:29.22]I'll always remember that you remembered.
[85:30.84]I don't get it.
[85:33.62]Well, Stormflare.
[85:37.46]There is Stormflare01.
[85:39.38]Stormflare01, subscribe to the channel.
[85:42.77]Gotcha.
[85:44.43]Well, I don't know what the fuck I did there, but what's done is done, right?
[85:49.33]What about the left?
[85:50.37]Have I been to the left?
[85:54.12]Okay, we gotta go up.
[85:56.14]We gotta go up.
[85:57.50]Up, up, up, up, up.
[86:01.72]Hey, go up the creepy alleyway on the right for some great deals.
[86:07.04]Creepy alleyway up the right for great deals.
[86:09.78]Okay.
[86:14.43]Hey, check it out.
[86:15.09]Yeah, check it out.
[86:16.39]Sell.
[86:17.81]Thanks.
[86:18.69]But we, like, don't really need anything.
[86:20.61]Oh my god, can you get us some glam burgers?
[86:23.86]We don't really need anything.
[86:25.38]I'll pay you a thousand gold if you get Mettaton to autograph my butt.
[86:30.07]Nobody buys anything?
[86:30.77]Is that like a joke here?
[86:34.13]That nobody purchases anything?
[86:37.29]Okay.
[86:37.41]What do you guys got?
[86:39.37]Junk food.
[86:41.05]Heal 17 HP, has a big bite out of it.
[86:43.58]Cowboy hat.
[86:44.28]What do I have for money?
[86:45.26]331?
[86:45.36]I didn't even need to spend that money on that stupid spider.
[86:50.62]I dropped like 200 gold on that stupid spider.
[86:52.98]I could have had a damn cowboy hat.
[86:55.44]Let's get some junk food.
[87:01.23]Mystery key.
[87:02.03]Probably somebody's house.
[87:04.39]Yeah, it is kind of like real life.
[87:13.88]Who the hell would want any of this useless shit?
[87:15.40]I don't know.
[87:17.08]See you later.
[87:17.72]I need a save point, and I need a bunch of other... What do you want, Sans?
[87:23.88]What are you doing here?
[87:25.38]Hey.
[87:26.36]Heard you're going to the Corps.
[87:27.86]How about grabbing some dinner with me first?
[87:30.36]Of course.
[87:30.74]Every opportunity, I'll eat dinner with you.
[87:32.96]Thanks for treating me.
[87:34.00]Oh, shit.
[87:35.90]Over here.
[87:36.92]I know a shortcut.
[87:39.14]Hey.
[87:42.83]Well, here we are.
[87:44.43]So, your journey's almost over, huh?
[87:47.89]You must really want to go home.
[87:50.17]Hey, I know the feeling, butto.
[87:52.77]Well, maybe sometimes it's better to take what's given to you.
[87:56.89]Down here, you've already got food, drink, friends.
[87:59.89]What you have to do, really worth it?
[88:02.15]Oh, forget it.
[88:07.77]I'm rooting for you, kid.
[88:15.27]I was drinking, and let me tell you a story.
[88:18.97]So I'm a sentry in Snowden Forest.
[88:22.01]I'm doing it in the wrong voice.
[88:23.97]I sit out there and watch for humans.
[88:25.33]It's kind of boring.
[88:27.07]Fortunately, deep in the forest is this huge locked door.
[88:31.47]And it's perfect for practicing knock-knock jokes.
[88:34.01]So one day, I'm knocking them out, like usual.
[88:36.96]I knock on the door, and I say, knock-knock.
[88:39.18]And suddenly, from the other guy, I hear a woman's voice.
[88:44.16]Who's there?
[88:45.32]So naturally, I respond, dishes.
[88:49.16]This is who?
[88:50.64]This is a very bad joke.
[88:51.78]And then she just hollers with laughter, like it's the best joke she'd ever heard in a hundred years.
[88:57.45]So I keep them coming, and she keeps laughing.
[89:00.53]She's the best audience I've ever had.
[89:02.71]Then, after a dozen of them, she knocks and says, knock, knock.
[89:06.27]I say, who's there?
[89:08.59]Old lady.
[89:09.85]Old lady who?
[89:11.60]Oh, I did not know you could yodel.
[89:12.96]Wow.
[89:15.21]Needless to say, this woman was extremely good.
[89:18.35]We kept telling each other jokes for hours.
[89:20.91]Eventually, I had to leave.
[89:23.33]The Pirates gets kind of cranky without his bedtime story.
[89:26.89]But she told me to come by again, and so I did.
[89:30.29]Then I did again, and again.
[89:32.21]It's a thing now.
[89:33.45]Telling bad jokes through the door.
[89:35.47]It rules.
[89:41.00]One day, though, I noticed she wasn't laughing very much.
[89:43.96]I asked her what was up, and she told me something strange.
[89:47.70]If a human ever comes through this door, would you please, please promise something?
[89:52.54]Watch over them and protect them, and will you not know?
[89:56.29]I hate making promises, and this woman... I don't even know her name.
[90:00.43]Alright, I'm done.
[90:01.79]I'm just reading.
[90:02.45]It's bad jokes.
[90:06.05]It's an integrity you can't say no to.
[90:13.27]Do you get what I'm saying?
[90:14.15]That promise I made to her.
[90:15.95]You know what would have happened if she hadn't said anything.
[90:20.71]Buddy.
[90:24.57]You'd be dead where you stand.
[90:28.44]What?
[90:28.68]Hey, lighten up, bucko.
[90:34.38]I'm just joking with you.
[90:35.34]That was a bad joke.
[90:36.14]It was in poor taste.
[90:38.70]Besides, haven't I done a great job protecting you?
[90:41.91]I mean, look at yourself.
[90:43.25]You haven't died a single time.
[90:45.21]That's right, isn't it?
[90:47.15]Well, shock enough to buy great skills.
[90:51.37]Stop turning away.
[90:52.05]Look at me.
[90:52.41]Look at me.
[90:53.05]Make eye contact with your dinner date, for crying out loud.
[90:55.50]What are you going to get?
[90:57.88]One of those fucking... I don't even know what those are.
[91:01.88]Trees.
[91:03.24]Well, that's all.
[91:03.80]Take care of yourself, kid.
[91:05.26]Because someone really cares about you.
[91:07.96]It's him.
[91:08.40]I know it's him.
[91:11.77]Yeah, he just, he would, I just got, he was just jock-shocking me, you know what I mean?
[91:15.51]Alright, now, every time you go to a restaurant, it's very important to take at least two pieces of silverware and put it in your bag.
[91:21.99]A couple of salt shakers.
[91:25.71]And if they have any extra Tabasco, just, you know, slip that in your pocket, too.
[91:28.63]You know, just take a couple of Splenders.
[91:30.83]How many, what are they, a little thing of Splenda on the left?
[91:32.95]Yeah, I'll take that, too, yeah, just, like, take the whole fucking rack.
[91:36.03]Don't do any of these things.
[91:37.75]By the way, don't fucking do that.
[91:40.24]You know, for those of us that work in the restaurant business, it's annoying when we have to refill the salt shaker, or when we have to refill... It's annoying.
[91:47.68]I've been a waiter for 15 years, and it's fucking annoying.
[91:50.78]Stop doing that.
[91:51.48]Stop taking things from the restaurant and thinking you're funny and hiding it somewhere.
[91:56.28]It makes us all pissed off, and it makes our lives harder.
[92:01.06]God.
[92:03.13]Originally, we dug mazes with puzzles in order to foil human attacks.
[92:08.24]But now, building these things... Oh, I can't even read right now.
[92:13.52]But now, building things winding and confusing.
[92:15.65]It's some awful tradition.
[92:16.97]You can't go two feet without being up to your armpits in puzzles.
[92:27.40]Okay.
[92:29.94]I work at the core.
[92:30.68]The inside is a maze made of swappable parts.
[92:34.28]As we can shuffle the layout at will.
[92:36.46]Boy, was today a fun day.
[92:37.40]I sure love puzzle.
[92:38.30]I feel like I've seen this bird somewhere.
[92:40.93]I'm the resort comedian.
[92:46.13]I'm very funny.
[92:46.67]People laugh at my jokes.
[92:48.31]Now my son, he wants to be a comedian like his father.
[92:50.78]Is that a father?
[92:54.06]But his jokes aren't funny.
[92:55.94]He tells awful puns.
[92:57.12]He's an embarrassment to our family.
[92:59.49]Ha ha.
[93:00.61]That's not funny.
[93:01.91]Since his mother passed on, he couldn't stand it, living at home anymore.
[93:07.23]So he ran away.
[93:08.07]I haven't seen him since.
[93:12.28]I'm a terrible father.
[93:13.80]Ha ha ha.
[93:14.80]That's not funny.
[93:17.22]Okay.
[93:19.78]It's a potted plant.
[93:23.60]Blood bulb you'll have to reserve a table to eat here.
[93:27.05]I also need to reserve your chair, your silverware, your food, your... Okay.
[93:34.35]I think I can just leave, right?
[93:42.67]Who's this dude?
[93:45.10]As I came in, I realized I forgot to make a reservation.
[93:47.59]I didn't want to look like I messed up, so I kept walking... I kept walking in anyway.
[93:52.21]Now I'm just kind of consuming dew off this fiscus, whatever it was.
[93:56.83]I'll make a reservation next time, dude.
[93:58.21]Don't screw it up.
[94:00.64]A frame full of quotes and photos.
[94:03.14]Foods to die for.
[94:03.88]Gorgeous style and fragrance.
[94:05.00]My face tastes beautiful.
[94:07.06]These are all Mettaton.
[94:07.94]Okay.
[94:12.49]Okay.
[94:15.91]Okay.
[94:20.29]Is this like Mettaton's hotel?
[94:21.65]Like where?
[94:22.21]I don't know.
[94:22.49]What the fuck am I?
[94:25.03]What is this?
[94:27.57]Origami.
[94:29.37]Welcome to MTT Resort, Portland's biggest apartment building turned hotel.
[94:33.47]Whether you're here for a night or still live here, MTT Resort prides itself on a great stay.
[94:40.01]Just passing through.
[94:41.31]Nice.
[94:41.79]MTT Resort prides itself on being passed through.
[94:46.60]How do I get a room?
[94:49.07]I like this a lot.
[94:49.69]I like this guy.
[94:51.71]Yeah, I'm not gonna be home tonight.
[94:52.95]I think there's some cold pizza in my treasure hoard you can heat up.
[94:56.11]This elevator goes straight to the capital, but it stopped working.
[95:02.18]The hotel is doing its best to accommodate everybody stuck here.
[95:06.02]So nobody can leave.
[95:08.60]As a slime, I'm outraged.
[95:12.11]Go back to game and watch.
[95:15.91]Elevator's in use, so I can't open it.
[95:29.96]I don't know what it is about this guy's face, but it's funny.
[95:38.32]Welcome to MTT Brand Burger Emporium, home of the Glam Burger.
[95:41.93]Oh, wait a minute.
[95:44.55]How much is a Glam Burger?
[95:47.11]Okay, I'm gonna buy this glam burger and I'm gonna bring it to the girl that wants a glam burger.
[95:49.81]That's what I'm doing.
[95:52.79]Whoa!
[95:56.60]Jesus.
[95:57.18]That actually scared me.
[96:07.54]Oh my God.
[96:08.40]Oh, this guy's, I hate this guy.
[96:17.45]Oh my god.
[96:19.49]Life advice.
[96:20.27]Okay, I have to... I have to sit here for at least a minute or two.
[96:24.83]Give me some life advice.
[96:28.40]Getting on in here, so let me give you some advice, little buddy.
[96:31.76]You've still got time.
[96:32.76]Don't live like me.
[96:35.12]I'm 19 years old and I've already wasted my entire life.
[96:39.03]Alright, give me some advice for the ladies.
[96:42.63]Listen, I like you, little buddy.
[96:44.37]So I'm gonna save you a lot of trouble.
[96:48.66]Never interact with attractive people.
[96:51.32]Unless you're one of them.
[96:53.10]They're just going to take advantage of you.
[96:55.22]Like that time those two chicks asked me to sneak them some glam burgers, and I naive teenager that I was said yes to them.
[97:02.99]Bad idea.
[97:06.19]Well, let's hear it.
[97:08.85]So I went out to the alley to see those two ladies and, you know, see what happened next.
[97:15.39]Then my boss saw me and asked me what I was doing.
[97:19.08]I was so startled, the hamburgers in my pockets tumbled out onto the ground.
[97:22.72]Not wanting to lose face, I scrambled to pick them up.
[97:26.02]But, as I was leaning over, the weight of the remaining hamburgers caused my pants to fall down.
[97:31.51]Then the girls laughed at me.
[97:34.57]Everyone calls me Burger Pants now.
[97:42.86]I'm gonna go.
[97:43.61]Will my pants fall down if I go over there?
[97:46.53]I bought one.
[97:47.07]Maybe my pants won't fall down.
[97:49.69]When I first came to Hauntland, it was my dream to work with Mettaton.
[97:56.62]Well, be careful what you wish for, little buddy.
[98:00.04]Why is Mettaton bad?
[98:02.22]God, have you even looked around?
[98:03.58]This place is a labyrinth of bad choices.
[98:06.36]And every time we try to change something for the better, he vetoes it and says, That's not how they would do it on the surface.
[98:12.92]Oh, right.
[98:13.96]Humans are always eating hamburgers made of sequins and glue.
[98:18.95]Why else is MTT bad?
[98:21.65]Why do people find him so attractive?
[98:23.69]He's literally just a freaking rectangle.
[98:26.97]You know, one time, I bought one of those, uh, kits online to...
[98:33.51]Make yourself more rectangular?
[98:35.07]They don't work.
[98:39.53]Alright, I think I've had enough of this guy.
[98:42.37]I think I've had enough of this guy.
[98:45.45]Dude, what about sell?
[98:47.23]Hmm, why not try selling that to the two chicks in the alley?
[98:51.28]Okay.
[98:52.56]Anytime, little buddy.
[98:54.76]Alright, that guy was fucked.
[98:57.74]That guy was fucked.
[99:03.08]Is that just a hand?
[99:05.90]Yes, we know.
[99:06.64]The elevator to the city is not working.
[99:08.90]Because of this incident, rooms are running at a special rate.
[99:12.92]200G a room.
[99:13.66]Interested.
[99:14.18]Do I have enough money?
[99:15.23]If I do, sure.
[99:15.89]That's not enough money.
[99:16.65]I need to get more money.
[99:18.51]Alright, I'm gonna go sell that hamburger for an outrageous amount of money to those two girls.
[99:23.21]Inscription.
[99:24.73]Royal Memorial Fountain built 21X.
[99:25.99]That town added last week.
[99:29.55]Okay.
[99:33.76]I'm gonna go.
[99:44.06]Hey, what do you know?
[99:45.48]Hey, ladies.
[99:47.38]Is that a Glam Burger?
[99:48.27]Oh my god, gimme.
[99:49.79]God, Caddy, try to have some self-control.
[99:53.35]Sorry.
[99:54.59]Because they obviously brought that Glam Burger from me.
[99:58.27]No way.
[99:58.99]Hey, Chip.
[100:04.30]What the hell?
[100:07.99]What the hell?
[100:09.19]Oh, there we go.
[100:09.81]Burger pants.
[100:10.43]No.
[100:12.03]Oh, that guy from the store?
[100:13.41]Yuck.
[100:13.83]What a creep.
[100:15.19]Yeah, he's a creep.
[100:17.01]But he's kinda cute, too.
[100:19.13]Come on, catty.
[100:19.95]Don't you have any standards?
[100:22.31]Nope!
[100:25.31]Okay, like, the annoying thing is, he'd be okay if he just treated us with some respect.
[100:31.07]but he just acts really weird.
[100:33.55]And then acts like it's our fault he acts that way.
[100:36.55]Like when we asked him to get those Glambergers, he dropped them and ran away before we could even say anything.
[100:42.43]We were like going to share them.
[100:43.99]Really?
[100:44.31]I wasn't.
[100:45.83]Catty!
[100:46.58]Oh, you're so funny.
[100:47.80]So should I go back and tell him?
[100:51.58]I'm going to go back and tell him.
[100:53.56]Right?
[100:55.20]I'm going to be the messenger in between?
[100:57.92]That sounds like a good idea, right?
[101:01.81]I'm gonna go tell him that everything's alright and that he should just go over and say hello.
[101:06.29]Right?
[101:07.73]See?
[101:09.53]The girls were talking about me?
[101:12.05]They say I should stop acting like they owe me?
[101:14.90]And if I want to be friends with them, I should just try to see things from their perspective?
[101:20.56]Wow.
[101:22.08]Poor naive little buddy.
[101:23.44]They've brainwashed you.
[101:25.40]Friendship is just a hot person's way of making you their slave.
[101:30.38]so uh what time would they want to hang out oh my god do I seriously have to go and ask them what time to hang out I'm gonna do it I'm gonna I'm gonna get to the end of this and see what happens oh yeah he should come look for junk with us
[101:55.27]But, like, if we let him hang out with us, I just worry it'll be really super fun.
[101:59.59]That was not what I was gonna say, but I was close, right?
[102:04.09]That kind of guy.
[102:05.03]Well, that kind of guy, you hang out with him once, then he wants to hang out all the time.
[102:14.36]What is happening right now?
[102:17.28]What is happening right now?
[102:18.55]Why am I doing this?
[102:20.87]Why am I doing this?
[102:25.17]Poor burger pants.
[102:26.05]Think about how cool we are compared to him.
[102:27.83]We could be saving his life with our friendship.
[102:31.27]His life, bratty.
[102:33.15]Uh, so?
[102:34.77]Think of all the glam burgers he could get for us.
[102:37.19]So is he free after work?
[102:39.09]Fucking god, you... You too?
[102:45.69]Let's go.
[102:46.25]Alright, what are you gonna say?
[102:54.35]They want to hang out after work.
[102:56.27]Ha!
[102:57.53]Yes!
[102:58.55]I won't let you down.
[103:00.45]Little buddy, thank you.
[103:02.47]You brought a tear to the eye of this old man.
[103:04.59]Old man?
[103:05.11]Did he say he was 19?
[103:07.97]So, uh, where do they want to go?
[103:09.15]They want to hang out at the garbage dump?
[103:12.91]Well, nowhere to go but up, right, little buddy?
[103:17.69]Um, thank you, little buddy.
[103:19.77]So, garbage dump, is that over there?
[103:28.29]Are they gonna be hanging out over here?
[103:33.63]Garbage dump?
[103:34.39]Where are they?
[103:38.62]What the hell?
[103:40.22]Where's the garbage dump?
[103:41.96]Wait, do I have to go all the way down to where I fell a long time ago with the trashes?
[103:53.07]Nothing over there.
[103:57.37]Do I really want to go all the way back there?
[103:59.01]I'm pretty sure that's where I need to go.
[104:05.03]You know, I did all that.
[104:06.93]I need to see this to the end.
[104:09.71]I'm going to go do it.
[104:11.45]I need to go do it.
[104:12.67]It's saved.
[104:15.11]Let's just get me out of here.
[104:19.80]Where's the fastest way to get the fuck out of here?
[104:22.28]Who are you?
[104:22.72]Who the fuck are you?
[104:27.20]Looked really cool in that dress.
[104:29.60]Sort of makes me feel like I could wear one too.
[104:33.36]Go do whatever you want.
[104:34.80]I got... I got a date to be... I gotta get to a date.
[104:38.72]Oh, hey, look who it is.
[104:40.40]Hey, there you are, dearie.
[104:41.32]You're always welcome in my parlor.
[104:43.56]Just stay on your best behavior.
[104:49.17]Fuck you.
[105:04.20]Save it.
[105:05.22]No, don't save it.
[105:05.78]I don't want to save it there.
[105:09.20]Oh, people are freaking out.
[105:10.02]People are freaking out right now.
[105:11.34]What did I do?
[105:14.26]Oh my god, people are freaking the fuck out.
[105:15.72]What happened?
[105:19.67]What happened here?
[105:21.07]Everyone's saying like, Daoka, where are you going?
[105:23.41]Ugh.
[105:34.94]Ugh.
[105:36.64]Alright.
[105:40.66]God, did I walk the wrong way or did I, like, punch your best friend in the face?
[105:50.08]I mean, you know what I mean?
[105:50.74]Like, did I go the wrong way or did I drive a car into your house?
[105:55.86]Which one of those two?
[105:56.48]I don't know which one happened.
[105:58.20]Judging by the extreme ship.
[106:00.57]Alright, where's the fast travel?
[106:03.24]Is this... I have to just take the elevator?
[106:10.09]So what was it?
[106:10.71]Right floor one?
[106:18.07]I'm going to go right floor one.
[106:21.52]I don't even know.
[106:29.58]I'm going this way.
[106:33.51]We're going to R1.
[106:34.43]I'm just walking.
[106:47.51]No!
[106:48.47]I went the wrong way!
[106:56.24]I'm going to cry.
[107:12.17]I will select, like, alright, I'm selecting my location.
[107:20.82]You fool!
[107:26.22]Hey, look it, I made it, this is the beginning.
[107:29.94]Hey, look what I found.
[107:32.96]I want to ride in the boat.
[107:35.12]Oh, waterfall, right?
[107:44.95]Just be, just be easy, man.
[107:49.39]It's a Sunday night.
[107:51.57]Relax.
[107:59.94]Gandalf would be sad.
[108:04.03]Come again sometime and my little kitty cat can say hi.
[108:08.07]Alright, where's the garbage dump?
[108:10.35]That was so long ago, I don't even know where the hell it is.
[108:12.70]Where is it?
[108:13.30]I have no idea.
[108:16.20]I wonder if I'm going the right way.
[108:17.50]I don't have any idea.
[108:20.00]I'll find it eventually.
[108:22.52]I don't think it's that way.
[108:32.07]No, it's definitely not this way.
[108:46.33]I can't go to Undyne's house because they locked me out of their pizza party.
[108:50.08]I don't want to talk to you.
[108:54.88]Get away from me.
[108:59.18]See, okay, so when I go to Undyne's house, right?
[109:02.14]I didn't kill Undyne.
[109:04.26]But they won't let me in.
[109:05.34]They're having a pizza party.
[109:07.70]And she doesn't want to hang out.
[109:09.64]She won't hang out with a murderer.
[109:13.80]Like...
[109:16.47]Yeah, I know.
[109:17.10]I've already seen this dialog.
[109:19.66]She won't let me in because I killed a couple of frogs.
[109:26.40]You know what I mean?
[109:28.60]Whoop-de-doo.
[109:31.09]So in a world with a bunch of monsters, I killed a couple of frogs.
[109:35.71]Alright, where are they?
[109:41.24]Where are they?
[109:45.21]They're supposed to be hanging out at the garbage dump.
[109:47.04]Where are they?
[109:55.64]I don't see anybody having a date.
[110:02.41]What?
[110:02.73]Where are they?
[110:07.80]This is a garbage dump.
[110:18.10]Okay.
[110:19.50]Now I'm a little irritated.
[110:23.48]What a waste of time.
[110:26.48]This is why chat was freaking out.
[110:28.22]Hey, blind playthrough.
[110:31.36]Sometimes you make mistakes because you want to see if something happened.
[110:34.70]Don't worry.
[110:35.28]I'm going back to the boat.
[110:39.06]Let me just open up my box.
[110:41.80]What do I have in there?
[110:42.74]Punch card.
[110:43.32]Um...
[110:47.49]Put the bandana away.
[110:48.45]I'm not going to use it right now.
[110:50.23]It's taking up space.
[110:54.33]What about... Is there anything?
[110:55.39]No.
[110:57.31]No.
[111:01.09]Let's go back to the hotlands.
[111:03.43]Where it's super hot.
[111:11.13]You can't please everyone.
[111:12.87]Jerma is so dumb.
[111:16.05]It's my first time playing the game ever.
[111:19.15]This isn't like my 15th pacifist run or something.
[111:22.39]Alright, let's do it.
[111:29.09]Come again sometime.
[111:30.23]Tra-da-da.
[111:35.02]Well, I guess I have to go back to... I want to... Hold on.
[111:40.18]The girl that's in here... Is she still in here?
[111:42.48]I want to just say hi.
[111:46.35]Shut these off.
[111:47.51]Shut these all off.
[111:50.61]If anyone can tell me what that's from.
[111:52.81]Shut these off.
[111:53.75]Shut these all off.
[111:55.81]I don't know.
[111:56.57]You win.
[111:58.76]What is that from?
[112:03.36]She's not there.
[112:06.78]If somebody gets that, I'll be surprised.
[112:11.14]Come on.
[112:11.80]Make me proud.
[112:12.40]Somebody make me proud.
[112:15.91]Holy shit, Ronnie, you got that right immediately.
[112:20.92]Ronnie, god damn, that was fucking quick.
[112:25.14]Wow, and people got it.
[112:26.80]I can't, people, holy shit, you guys rock.
[112:28.82]How did you guys know that?
[112:30.28]How did you ever know that?
[112:31.12]How did so many of you people know that?
[112:33.63]Where am I going, right three?
[112:36.01]I don't know.
[112:38.35]Shut these off.
[112:39.25]Shut these all off.
[112:44.25]You got anything else for me, anything?
[112:46.84]No, you don't.
[112:47.24]Alright, where was I going?
[112:52.21]Straight up?
[112:54.65]Right?
[112:54.87]And then straight in.
[112:57.15]I have to buy a room in this hotel, or can I just not do that?
[113:01.96]How much money do I have?
[113:05.70]136 gold.
[113:06.18]I need money.
[113:07.26]I need money.
[113:12.55]We watched the movie, Jeremiah.
[113:14.93]That movie came out like in 1940.
[113:15.87]Huh?
[113:17.35]Who are they?
[113:21.97]Who else is supposed to be here?
[113:23.79]Oh well, we can't worry about that now.
[113:26.39]Click.
[113:32.07]This place is kind of creepy.
[113:37.39]This is it.
[113:39.79]Take the elevator up to the top of the core.
[113:43.80]Click.
[113:46.82]What about in these rooms?
[113:51.84]Hey, why don't you try to use the elevator first?
[113:54.30]Uh-oh.
[113:57.75]Uh-oh.
[113:59.23]Uh-oh.
[114:00.05]Magic pops out of its hat.
[114:03.07]Out of my way.
[114:16.44]I don't trust magic users, you know what I mean?
[114:20.52]Magic user?
[114:22.08]Are you kidding me?
[114:25.08]Look at the way he's moving around.
[114:31.65]Nothing to do with this guy.
[114:32.55]I don't trust this guy at all.
[114:33.77]Are you kidding me?
[114:40.19]And he's shooting like Satanic crosses at me.
[114:42.23]Wow.
[114:49.18]Hey, Captain Narwhal, thank you for your support.
[114:55.85]What's that?
[114:57.65]Oh, we got Mercy.
[114:58.91]I could let him go.
[114:59.55]Get the fuck out of here!
[115:09.19]That's how you get money.
[115:11.81]That's how you make money.
[115:19.25]It's no problem, right?
[115:20.05]Why?
[115:20.17]There's so many monsters.
[115:20.95]We need to keep heading forward.
[115:28.73]I like this music.
[115:41.18]I can't go over here.
[115:42.04]Hit the switch, but those lasers might do what we do.
[115:50.83]Looks like they'll come in handy, this order.
[115:52.97]Orange, orange, blue.
[115:54.69]Got it.
[115:55.58]Moving to the third one.
[115:56.48]I did not pay any attention to that at all.
[115:59.64]I had... See, that's what happens when you don't pay any attention.
[116:04.78]Watch out for the ice.
[116:05.32]This is an ice level.
[116:05.98]You're going to slip.
[116:08.49]Oh my god, are you okay?
[116:10.37]I'm so sorry.
[116:11.09]I gave you the wrong order.
[116:12.01]It didn't even matter because I didn't even pay attention.
[116:16.17]Everything's fine, okay?
[116:17.81]Let's just keep heading to the right.
[116:20.43]Click.
[116:24.30]Thought I was going to be rid of this person.
[116:28.20]Try heading to the right.
[116:30.54]Don't listen.
[116:30.98]I'm not listening to her.
[116:33.40]She was wrong the last time and she's right this time.
[116:36.16]Night Knight blocks the way.
[116:37.48]Okay, this guy's kind of scary.
[116:39.69]So I don't... I'm just going to sing to him.

[119:22.45]West, the sage's path.

[124:31.30]What are you so afraid of?
[124:33.07]Okay, well now it's time to die.
[124:34.35]Because I don't want to sit here and just do this shit.
[124:41.64]You know what?
[124:41.96]Just get one, two, three.
[124:45.50]I need the money.
[124:47.98]I need the fucking experience, and I need the cash.
[124:50.02]I need the HP.
[124:53.58]I saved one out of three.
[124:54.60]That ain't bad.
[124:55.14]What did that do?
[125:04.87]No idea what that did.
[125:11.08]I guess I'm going to follow the electricity on the ground.
[125:15.12]Right?
[125:15.40]I mean, that would make sense, right?
[125:16.31]Look at the ground.
[125:18.19]Would that make sense to anybody else?
[125:21.87]I mean, it makes sense to me.
[125:30.29]And I'm going by just odd logic.
[125:34.83]What's that?
[125:37.89]Alright, the electricity's gone, so I was wrong.
[125:51.21]I should go to the hotel and buy a room.
[125:54.19]What was I doing, Sage?
[125:55.17]Because I'm so smart.
[125:59.15]Let's go.
[126:03.65]Get lost and stay that way.
[126:06.00]I went over here.
[126:06.76]To the east, this is the end.
[126:09.20]I cannot fight, I cannot fight.
[126:12.28]But with patience, I'll make my way through to the east.
[126:15.48]This looks pretty east to me.
[126:25.31]pick on me.
[126:25.85]What?
[126:27.01]You want me to pick on you?
[126:29.03]Well, fine.
[126:30.29]That's what you want.
[126:32.99]Pick on.
[126:34.67]That's right.
[126:35.31]Well, you're glutton for punishment, apparently.
[126:41.89]Doesn't care about fighting anymore.
[126:43.69]That was easy.
[126:44.73]No, I didn't want to fight.
[126:45.57]I thought it was going to default to spare.
[126:47.07]I did not think that was going to happen.
[126:49.74]Spare.
[126:52.26]Go, go, go.
[126:52.88]Go away.
[126:53.20]Get away from me.
[126:56.90]Did it!
[126:58.76]I made it.
[126:59.54]Behind this door must be the elevator to the king's castle.
[127:03.06]Filled with determination.
[127:11.37]Oh!
[127:13.27]What happened?
[127:14.37]My game just like... I just minimized accidentally.
[127:18.43]Alright, what door?
[127:18.93]Um, this one.
[127:21.81]No, not that one.
[127:24.23]Did I fix the elevator?
[127:26.61]Okay, no, that is the elevator that goes up to the next room.
[127:29.55]Alright, hold on.
[127:31.06]I didn't go in this room.
[127:32.60]What is in here?
[127:35.06]Lots of nothing.
[127:41.32]We're just going up.
[127:46.44]I've got a feeling something important's here.
[127:48.26]Here he is.
[127:48.66]This is my buddy.
[127:50.28]Oh, yes.
[127:50.82]There you are, darling.
[127:52.59]It's time to have our little showdown.
[127:55.11]It's time to finally stop the malfunctioning robot.
[127:58.99]Not malfunction.
[128:01.11]Reprogramming.
[128:01.87]Get real.
[128:03.07]This was all just a big show.
[128:04.88]An act.
[128:06.12]Alphys has been playing you for a fool the whole time.
[128:09.87]As she watched you on the screen, she grew attached to your adventure.
[128:13.57]She desperately... I can't believe I got that word wrong.
[128:17.74]She desperately wanted to be a part of it.
[128:20.66]So she decided to insert herself into your story.
[128:24.10]She reactivated puzzles.
[128:26.10]She disabled elevators.
[128:27.54]She enlisted me to torment you.
[128:30.32]All so she could save you from dangers that didn't exist.
[128:34.73]All so you would think she's the great person.
[128:37.45]That she's not.
[128:39.23]And now it's time for her finest hour.
[128:41.77]At this very moment, Alphys is waiting outside the room.
[128:45.69]During a battle, she will interrupt.
[128:49.08]She will pretend to deactivate me, saving you one final time.
[128:53.60]Finally, she'll be the heroine of your adventure.
[128:56.98]You'll regard her so highly, she'll even be able to convince you not to leave.
[129:01.68]Or not.
[129:02.92]You see, I had enough of this predictable charade.
[129:05.58]I have no desire to harm humans.
[129:08.30]Far from it, actually.
[129:09.82]My only desire is to entertain.
[129:12.30]After all, the audience deserves a good show, don't they?
[129:16.27]And what's a good show without a plot twist?
[129:22.17]Hey, what's going on in there?
[129:23.75]That's the door just locked.
[129:25.79]Sorry, folks, the old program's been canceled.
[129:28.74]But we've got a finale that will drive you wild.
[129:35.83]Real drama reaction, real bloodshed.
[129:39.20]Real everything.
[129:40.32]On our new show, Attack of the Killer Robot.
[129:48.25]Okay, Mettaton.
[129:55.95]I don't... I don't want to fight... fucking fight you again.
[129:58.68]Wait a minute.
[129:59.26]I can, like, shoot him, right?
[130:00.38]Can I just shoot him?
[130:01.16]Burn.
[130:03.03]This is probably what you'll do if things continue in this matter.
[130:06.89]Yes, I was the one that rearranged the core.
[130:09.01]I was the one that hired everyone to kill you.
[130:11.13]That, however, was a short-sighted plan.
[130:13.37]You know what would be a hundred times better?
[130:16.01]Killing you myself.
[130:18.95]What?
[130:20.07]That worthless pea shooter won't work on me, darling.
[130:22.61]Don't you understand what acting is?
[130:26.14]Mettaton.
[130:30.54]Hmm...
[130:40.47]This is probably where you burn.
[130:42.37]Listen, darling, I've seen you fight.
[130:44.25]You're weak.
[130:45.09]If you continue forward, Asgore will take your soul.
[130:47.25]And with your soul, Asgore will destroy humanity.
[130:51.39]Well, it can't... It's not like Galga.
[130:52.53]I can't, like, shoot them.
[130:57.30]His metal body renders him... Okay, so he's invincible.
[131:00.20]But if I get your soul, I can stop Asgore's plan.
[131:02.92]I can save humanity from destruction.
[131:06.36]It is.
[131:06.74]It is.
[131:07.02]Okay, I can do it.
[131:07.78]I can do it.
[131:13.44]Then using your soul, I'll cross through the barrier and become the star I've always dreamed of being.
[131:18.29]Hundreds, thousands, no, millions of humans will watch me.
[131:25.76]Okay, I'm starting to understand.
[131:32.06]Glitz, glamour, I finally have it all.
[131:34.44]So what if a few people have to die?
[131:36.01]That's show business, baby.
[131:39.71]Here she goes.
[131:41.25]I can't see what's going on there, but don't don't give up.
[131:43.77]Okay, there's one Last way to beat Mettaton.
[131:47.63]It's um, it's this is work in progress So don't judge it too hard, but you know how Mettaton always faces forward.
[131:53.75]That's because there's a switch on his back Turn him around and press the switch.
[131:59.47]He'll be Vulnerable.
[132:02.20]Well gotta go
[132:04.16]Seems like a good time to turn Mettaton around.
[132:07.11]Turn.
[132:08.13]You tell Mettaton that there is a mirror behind him.
[132:10.63]Oh, a mirror.
[132:11.61]Right.
[132:12.07]I have to look perfect for our grand finale.
[132:14.57]I don't see it.
[132:15.11]Where is it?
[132:19.96]That was funny.
[132:21.62]Did you just flip my switch?
[132:25.60]Oh, no.
[132:26.30]My brain's being scrambled.
[132:27.42]What do I do?
[132:28.19]How do I get out of this situation?
[132:29.53]I'm all fucked up now.
[132:30.97]You killed me.
[132:34.04]You killed me.
[132:37.72]I'm dead.
[132:39.78]I'm dead.
[132:40.20]I'm not... I'm not... Oh, my.
[132:43.58]If you flipped my switch, that can only mean one thing.
[132:45.86]You're desperate for the premiere of my new body.
[132:50.07]How rude.
[132:51.57]Lucky for you, I've been aching to show this off for a long time.
[132:55.35]So, thanks.
[132:57.43]I'll give you a handsome reward.
[132:58.95]I'll make your last living moments... Absolutely beautiful!
[133:05.26]Oh boy, what the hell is about to happen?
[133:07.82]Okay, so this is the real fight.
[133:10.82]We're losing ratings, we're losing ratings.
[133:13.27]Uh, pose.
[133:15.41]You pose dramatically, the audience nods.
[133:17.17]Okay, I gotta keep the... Alright, got it.
[133:21.33]Hold on, I'm putting my headphones in.
[133:23.71]Like, all the way in.
[133:26.27]This is the music from before, isn't it?
[133:27.51]Hold on a second.
[133:31.65]I'm blasting this shit.
[133:36.21]I'm turning this up.
[133:40.33]Turn it up.
[133:40.89]Let's go.
[133:48.12]You posed.
[133:51.64]Lights, camera, action.
[133:55.32]Whoa.
[133:56.76]Okay, so, okay, I got it, I got it.
[133:58.85]I just figured the whole thing out right there.
[134:04.03]Uh... Boast.
[134:06.75]You say you aren't going to get hit at all.
[134:08.71]Ratings gradually increase during Mettaton's turn.
[134:11.67]That voice doesn't really work now.
[134:14.33]Oh, fuck!
[134:16.80]I got hit!
[134:17.92]Oh, my God!
[134:18.58]Okay, hold on.
[134:19.00]I'm sitting up.
[134:19.88]I need to eat my junk food.
[134:22.88]Audience is disgusted.
[134:26.10]I'm the idol.
[134:26.80]Okay.
[134:27.44]This is important.
[134:29.82]Oh, God.
[134:31.66]Oh, my God!
[134:32.68]I...
[134:39.69]The audience is disgusted again.
[134:44.01]You gotta pose, you gotta pose.
[134:50.42]Uh, pose.
[134:53.56]Audience nods.
[134:54.76]Ooh, it's time for a pop quiz!
[134:55.90]I hope you brought a keyboard!
[134:57.74]I got a keyboard, this one's an easy question.
[135:00.35]Why do you love, what do you love most about Mettaton?
[135:03.13]What?
[135:03.53]No exit.
[135:04.07]What?
[135:04.43]Why do you love most about Mettaton?
[135:06.09]What?
[135:06.33]I don't understand.
[135:06.99]What happened?
[135:08.43]Oh, I won.
[135:08.95]Okay, good.
[135:10.09]Speechless, who can blame you?
[135:12.17]Mettaton is saving your essay for a future use.
[135:19.08]Pose again.
[135:22.25]Your essay really showed everyone your heart.
[135:23.96]Why don't I show you mine?
[135:25.70]Shoot him!
[135:37.35]Mettaton is now standing here.
[135:40.60]Pause again.
[135:42.54]You pose dramatically.
[135:43.62]The audience applauds.
[135:45.50]Oh, I'm just warming up?
[135:48.04]Oh, what'd they throw up?
[135:52.71]They threw... Feed the cat.
[136:00.89]How are you on the dance floor?
[136:03.07]That means don't move, right?
[136:05.45]Oh, shit.
[136:10.32]Oh my God, Ed, my God, oh my God, oh my God!
[136:12.78]I have to shoot it.
[136:26.07]God, that's fucking so horrible.
[136:35.48]Lights, camera, bombs.
[136:43.60]Smells like Metatron.
[136:46.20]I'm supposed to heel turn, right?
[136:53.27]Things are blowing up.
[136:59.93]Do it again.
[137:02.43]Pose again.
[137:04.18]Let's go get this thing up to 10,000.
[137:05.58]Our union regulated break.
[137:09.40]Happy break time.
[137:10.26]Give me some heals.
[137:14.67]Okay, hold on.
[137:15.21]Despite being hurt.
[137:18.59]I know I have to heal turn.
[137:19.57]I forget.
[137:20.01]Remember I said I was going to forget?
[137:24.22]I don't want to kill him though, right?
[137:34.24]I don't know.
[137:34.60]I don't want to kill him.
[137:35.70]I love this character.
[137:36.80]He's not dying.
[137:43.37]I killed him.
[137:43.79]Did I kill him?
[137:44.55]What?
[137:45.67]I think I killed him.
[137:50.73]Alright, let's try it.
[137:51.55]Heel turn.
[137:52.71]You turn and scoff at the audience.
[137:54.61]They're rooting for your destruction this turn.
[137:57.65]With these arms with legs like these, I'm still going to win.
[138:00.12]I fucking have no idea what just happened.
[138:03.26]What's even going on?
[138:03.90]Don't hit the bombs.
[138:04.32]Don't hit the bombs.
[138:04.84]Don't hit the bombs.
[138:05.54]Don't hit the bombs.
[138:06.74]No, how do they?
[138:07.16]I don't know.
[138:09.24]Post.
[138:13.58]Come on.
[138:17.74]Alright, here it comes.
[138:18.64]Up, left, and then okay.
[138:25.90]Better top.
[138:29.08]Boast.
[138:29.40]I'm not gonna get hit at all.
[138:30.72]I'm not gonna get hit at all.
[138:40.67]Pose.
[138:43.77]Drama action.
[138:45.45]Fuck.
[138:52.10]I gotta eat the burger.
[138:53.98]Alright, I- I- The audience loves the brand.
[138:56.36]Alright, I gotta fucking- This has gotta end.
[138:59.46]Enough of this.
[138:59.90]Do you really want humanity to perish?
[139:01.32]Or do you just believe in yourself that much?
[139:05.44]Whoa!
[139:05.80]Whoa, I can't break those.
[139:08.27]Holy fuck!
[139:09.09]I forgot everything.
[139:10.15]I forgot everything that round.
[139:11.95]Everything.
[139:15.92]How inspiring.
[139:16.76]Well, darling, it's either me or you.
[139:18.64]But I think we both already know who's going to win.
[139:20.95]What does the true power of humanity star?
[139:27.13]What the fuck is happening to my life?
[139:30.09]I'm losing.
[139:33.85]I'm losing.
[139:35.63]Did I lose?
[139:39.29]I'm losing.
[139:43.22]Are you the star?
[139:45.22]Can you really protect humanity?
[139:50.38]Getting crazy here, guys.
[140:00.15]I'm turning heel again.
[140:10.26]I hate this thing.
[140:10.98]I hate this thing.
[140:11.86]I didn't even need to move.
[140:16.08]Holy shit, that was easy.
[140:17.16]I didn't even have to move.
[140:18.50]Do I need to get to like 10,000 or something?
[140:27.47]Holy shit.
[140:28.33]What have I done?
[140:29.99]What have I done?
[140:30.59]I gotta get up to 10,000.
[140:38.10]Got to get to 10,000.
[140:40.50]Forgot.
[140:45.74]I'm at 10,000.
[140:53.63]I don't know how to end this.
[140:56.01]I'll look at those ratings.
[140:56.95]Oh, I got it.
[140:57.47]10,000.
[140:57.49]This is the most viewers I've ever had.
[141:00.83]We've reached the viewer call in milestone.
[141:03.33]One lucky viewer will have the chance to talk to me.
[141:06.53]before I leave the underground forever.
[141:07.96]Oh, he's dead?
[141:09.58]Did I actually kill him?
[141:10.48]I hope I didn't.
[141:11.98]Let's see who calls in first.
[141:15.71]Hi, you're on TV.
[141:17.45]What do you have to say on this, our last show?
[141:22.36]Oh, hi, Mettaton.
[141:24.52]I really liked watching your show.
[141:27.24]My life is pretty boring, but seeing you on the screen brought excitement to my life, vicariously.
[141:34.59]I can't tell, but I guess this is the last episode?
[141:38.53]I'll miss you, Mettaton.
[141:40.87]Oh, I didn't mean to talk so long.
[141:44.11]Oh, no, wait, wait!
[141:46.53]They already hung up.
[141:49.59]I'll take another caller.
[141:51.68]Mettaton, your show made us so happy.
[141:53.21]Mettaton, I don't know what I'd watch without you.
[141:55.89]Mettaton, there's a Mettaton-shaped hole in my Mettaton-shaped heart.
[142:01.65]I... I see.
[142:05.92]Everyone, thank you so much.
[142:09.78]Darling, perhaps it might be better if I stay here for a while.
[142:16.14]Humans already have stars and idols, but monsters, they only have me.
[142:23.07]If I left, the underground would lose its spark.
[142:26.47]I'd leave an aching void that can never be filled.
[142:30.25]So, I think I'll have to delay my big debut.
[142:34.77]Besides, you've proven to be very strong.
[142:38.79]Perhaps, even strong enough to get past Asgore.
[142:43.67]I'm sure you'll be able to protect humanity.
[142:47.36]It's all for the best anyway.
[142:49.62]The truth is, this form's energy consumption is inefficient.
[142:55.46]In a few moments, I'll run out of battery power and, well, I'll be alright.
[143:01.90]Knock him dead, darling.
[143:04.18]And everyone, thank you.
[143:08.49]You've been a great audience.
[143:12.17]Bye.
[143:14.01]Now I'm dead.
[143:15.17]I thought I wasn't supposed to kill that guy.
[143:22.14]Hey, is he able to walk?
[143:26.37]Oh no, you killed Mettaton.
[143:27.85]What have you done?
[143:28.51]Mettaton, Mettaton, are you okay?
[143:32.77]That's sad.
[143:33.43]I loved that.
[143:34.40]That was a good character.
[143:36.62]It was fun.
[143:38.78]Thank God it's just the batteries.
[143:40.00]Mettaton, if you were gone, I would have... I would have... I mean, hey.
[143:46.49]It's no problem.
[143:47.21]You know.
[143:48.11]He's just a robot.
[143:49.67]If you messed it up, I could always just build another.
[143:53.05]Hmm.
[143:54.27]Cool.
[143:58.53]Go on ahead.
[144:01.43]Anything else you have to say?
[144:02.25]I just need somebody.
[144:03.06]I need a moment.
[144:04.72]It's out of batteries.
[144:05.42]Oh, flip the switch on his back.
[144:07.58]Oh, I can turn the switch on and he'll turn on and he'll go, Oh, ladies and gentlemen, it's me, Mettaton.
[144:11.68]I'm back and ready for action.
[144:15.40]Oh, well.
[144:17.33]Oh, that was... That was sad.
[144:24.63]Sorry about that.
[144:26.53]Let's keep going.
[144:29.83]You know, didn't he tell me that she was gonna, like, try to kill me?
[144:32.71]This is really weird.
[144:35.07]I really don't like that you're following me like that.
[144:37.75]Can we walk together?
[144:39.61]Like this?
[144:41.81]Do you have to be that far behind me?
[144:43.07]I feel like you're going to pull a knife out instead of stabbing me.
[144:47.45]You're about to meet Asgore, huh?
[144:48.61]You must be pretty excited.
[144:51.19]I don't like this.
[144:56.83]You'll finally get to go home.
[145:07.24]Wait.
[145:09.16]I mean, um... I was just going to... say goodbye, and... I can't take this anymore.
[145:18.74]I... I lied to you.
[145:23.32]A human soul isn't strong enough to cross the barrier alone.
[145:26.31]It takes at least a human soul and a monster soul.
[145:31.35]Well, you lied.
[145:33.71]If you want to go home...
[145:35.39]have to take his soul.
[145:37.09]You'll have to kill Asgore.
[145:42.13]Okay.
[145:43.75]That's it?
[145:45.90]You're telling me all I gotta do is kill the ultimate bad guy?
[145:48.56]And I get to walk as a free man?
[145:50.70]Are you serious?
[145:56.10]That's the easiest information you've told me all day.
[145:57.88]Let's go.
[146:05.45]Let's go.
[146:05.99]This is a long ride.
[146:17.52]Hold on.
[146:26.96]Okay, let's do it.
[146:29.32]Where is he?
[146:31.17]Where's this punk?
[146:35.32]We're in Bowser's castle right now.
[146:36.82]I'll show him.
[146:37.88]What's in this elevator?
[146:40.03]It's in use.
[146:40.61]Alright.
[146:41.37]Let's take me to him.
[146:45.39]Let's go.
[146:46.05]Let's go get him.
[146:47.95]The ultimate bad guy.
[146:49.85]Asgore.
[146:51.89]Asgore the Unlikely.
[146:53.22]That's his name, right?
[146:54.10]That's his tagline.
[146:57.04]You are fucking dead.
[147:01.04]This is weird.
[147:09.35]Okay.
[147:10.83]Another save point.
[147:13.48]New home.
[147:14.20]What?
[147:15.42]What the hell?
[147:26.66]The way is blocked by two padlocks.
[147:28.32]There's a note attached.
[147:30.11]Howdy, I'm in the garden.
[147:31.27]If you have anything you need to get off your chest, please don't hesitate to come.
[147:35.93]The keys are in the kitchen and the hallway.
[147:39.63]Isn't this Toriel's house?
[147:43.11]This is Toriel's house.
[147:47.71]The coals are still warm.
[147:51.77]Hey, it's supposed to be in my new house!
[147:55.37]A long time ago, a human fell into the ruins.
[147:57.19]Injured by its fall, the human called out for help.
[148:02.74]No, no, no, no, no.
[148:04.02]Don't, no, don't, no.
[148:05.32]Don't spring this on me.
[148:06.94]You took the key and put it on your phone's keychain.
[148:13.80]No, they're gonna start springing some heavy shit on me, and I... It's a golden flower.
[148:22.32]Wait a minute.

[149:20.76]Another key.
[149:25.93]Asgore's journal.
[149:27.79]All the current page says is, nice day today.
[149:32.17]The ink is still almost wet.
[149:36.94]There's a Santa Claus outfit inside.
[149:40.10]Number one, number one, number one, dad.
[149:42.48]Number one, Nose Nuzzle Champs, 98.
[149:44.84]I have the keys.
[149:52.58]Unlock the chain.
[150:00.43]Do I want to go down here?
[150:03.07]Do I want to go down here?
[150:06.09]Do I want to know what's happening, or do I want to just go... Where's the funny skeleton?
[150:10.39]Where's the funny skeleton guy?
[150:11.59]I don't want to be... Let's go find him so we can crack a couple more jokes that were funny.
[150:16.35]I don't want to be sad.
[150:17.23]What happened?
[150:17.71]Alright, what happened?
[150:18.77]Tell me.
[150:19.85]Tell me what happened.
[150:20.39]Then one day, the human became very ill.
[150:30.40]Huh?
[150:35.82]The sick human had only one request.
[150:38.66]To see the flowers from their village.
[150:42.46]But there was nothing we could do.
[150:43.72]The next day.
[150:52.59]The next day.
[150:54.43]The sick human died.
[151:06.57]Asriel, wracked with grief, absorbed the human's soul.
[151:11.45]He transformed into a being with incredible power.
[151:21.51]With the human's soul, Asriel crossed through the barrier.
[151:26.55]He carried the human's body into the sunset, back to the village of the humans.
[151:38.40]Asriel reached the center of the village.
[151:42.26]There he found a bed of golden flowers.
[151:45.78]He carried the human onto it.
[151:49.44]This is getting fucking intense.
[151:53.55]Suddenly screams rang out.
[151:56.51]The villagers saw Asriel holding the human's body.
[152:00.35]They thought that he had killed the child.
[152:09.33]The humans attacked him with everything they had.
[152:11.85]He was struck with blow after blow.
[152:16.54]Asriel had the power to destroy them all.
[152:19.18]But he didn't.
[152:25.04]But Asriel did not fight back.
[152:29.95]Clutching the human, Asriel smiled and walked away.
[152:39.78]When the wounded Adriel stumbled home, he entered the castle and collapsed as dust spread across the garden.
[152:49.94]Oh boy!
[152:53.16]The kingdom fell into despair.
[152:55.72]The king and queen had lost two children in one night.
[152:59.72]The humans had once again taken everything from us.
[153:08.32]The king decided it is time to end our suffering.
[153:12.04]Every human who falls down here must die.
[153:14.30]With enough souls, we can shatter the barrier forever.
[153:19.35]Okay.
[153:22.13]It's not long now.
[153:25.05]King Asgore will let us go.
[153:27.51]King Asgore will give us hope.
[153:28.51]King Asgore will save us all.
[153:36.08]You should be smiling, too.
[153:38.90]Aren't you excited?
[153:40.92]Aren't you happy?
[153:41.72]It's a frog.
[153:48.48]You're going to be free.
[153:55.29]Alright.
[153:57.31]Alright.
[153:58.53]Well.
[154:01.09]Elevator was going down?
[154:03.95]Save point.
[154:06.31]I'm assuming the elevator just is speed speed strap right speed.
[154:12.36]Let's just, let's just say, okay.
[154:13.88]Yeah, it's a speech strategy.
[154:15.30]Got it.
[154:20.46]Some kind of cathedral or something.
[154:26.73]Oh, Oh.
[154:36.61]Okay, is that Sans?
[154:43.51]So you finally made it.
[154:45.23]The end of your journey is at hand.
[154:47.12]In a few moments, you will meet the King.
[154:50.12]Together, you will determine the future of this world.
[154:53.72]That's then.
[154:55.64]Now, you will be judged.
[154:57.90]You will be judged for your every action.
[155:00.26]You will be judged for every EXP you've earned.
[155:03.20]What's EXP?
[155:04.74]It's an acronym.
[155:06.13]It stands for execution points.
[155:08.83]A way of quantifying the pain you have inflicted on others.
[155:14.41]When you kill someone, your EXP increases.
[155:17.45]When you have enough EXP, your love increases.
[155:20.87]Love, too, is an acronym.
[155:23.09]It stands for level of violence.
[155:24.87]A way of measuring someone's capacity to hurt.
[155:29.57]The more you kill, the easier it becomes to distance yourself.
[155:32.75]The more you distance yourself, the less you will hurt.
[155:36.39]The more easily you can bring yourself to hurt others.
[155:41.04]Now you understand.
[155:41.76]Yeah, I sure do.
[155:43.94]It's time to begin your judgment.
[155:45.56]Look inside yourself.
[155:46.70]Have you really done the right thing?
[155:49.86]Considering what you've done, what will you do now?
[155:53.93]Take a moment to think about this.
[155:58.44]I didn't know that's what it was.
[156:01.66]Execution points.
[156:04.44]Level of violence.
[156:07.74]Truthfully, it doesn't really matter what you said.
[156:10.12]All that's important is that you were honest with yourself.
[156:13.16]What happens now?
[156:13.74]We leave up to you.
[156:18.84]What did I do?
[156:20.00]What did I do?
[156:20.70]How many execution points do I have?
[156:22.34]649.
[156:23.50]That's not very... That's not high.
[156:27.59]barely 650 I didn't do anything and you guys I you saw I saved people I spy hey where's when you spare people where's your you spared people points huh I should have at least like 200 of those whatever I'm gonna like think about my life for a second
[156:57.81]Okay.
[156:59.67]Alright.
[157:01.07]Where'd he go?
[157:03.75]Let's go.
[157:04.31]I... I didn't kill them all.
[157:12.47]Hey, sometimes you need to attack, right?
[157:14.57]Throne room.
[157:15.73]Oh, boy.
[157:18.73]Am I gonna get, like, judged?
[157:20.23]We're not going to the throne room.
[157:21.23]What's down here?
[157:22.19]A sacred path?
[157:26.39]What is down here?
[157:33.48]Oh, stuff.
[157:35.59]It's a coffin.
[157:36.21]There's a name engraved on it.
[157:38.43]Sure, it's empty.
[157:39.67]That's my coffin.
[157:42.91]Who are these other coffins?
[157:47.21]Oh, boy.
[157:47.63]Wait a second.
[157:48.09]I think I'm figuring out... I think I'm figuring out what's happening.
[157:55.27]There's somebody in one of those coffins.
[157:56.51]There's one person in those coffins, I think.
[158:00.37]Yeah, pretty much.
[158:03.08]Oh well.
[158:08.86]What have I done?
[158:12.22]Wait, what do you mean my stuff?
[158:13.70]When somebody said my stuff, what's wrong with my stuff?
[158:21.52]Don't I have stuff on?
[158:27.30]Apparently not.
[158:27.90]I have stuff on.
[158:31.45]Heartlock it.
[158:32.05]What is this?
[158:33.85]Oh, it says best friends forever.
[158:36.32]Oh, yeah.
[158:36.72]That's probably a good idea.
[158:39.70]Okay.
[158:40.32]Let's go.
[158:41.16]Let's go lose.
[158:43.76]Wait a minute.
[158:48.98]I need to get like sandwiches or something, right?
[158:51.15]Hold on.
[158:51.91]Stat.
[158:53.79]I have plenty of money.
[158:54.85]Is this like the final battle?
[158:56.11]Because I feel like I need to...
[159:02.10]I need heals.
[159:02.74]I'm not gonna be, like, embarrassed.
[159:03.70]You know, let's just... I'm gonna pee.
[159:07.66]First of all, I'm gonna pee, okay?
[159:10.64]I'm gonna pee.
[159:12.12]So, just chill out.
[159:14.32]Stare at the screen for a minute.
[159:15.34]Go get a sandwich.
[159:17.42]Go get a drink.
[159:18.54]Go get a latte.
[159:20.38]Be back in, like, fucking two minutes.
[159:23.69]I'm gonna go get some heals.
[159:27.05]Just chill out.
[161:42.63]So what's the fastest way out of here to get sandwiches?
[161:47.72]It's a secret.
[161:48.62]I can climb up that.
[161:54.68]Let me take the elevator.
[161:55.54]Are you Austin Powers?
[162:03.58]That was a long piss.
[162:05.96]Hey, I had to go, man.
[162:08.38]Sometimes you gotta go.
[162:18.34]Lots of elevators.
[162:21.02]No.
[162:27.31]Back to go get a burger.
[162:30.37]Or maybe not burgers.
[162:40.33]Yeah, I have not died one time.
[162:43.68]I have not been defeated.
[162:46.36]Once.
[162:48.30]Oh, best music.
[162:51.51]Wait.
[163:00.53]So, what's the cheapest, best thing to get for heals?
[163:02.65]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[163:05.95]I gotta get a hotel room.
[163:06.95]That's important.
[163:09.57]I want a hotel room.
[163:10.35]Yes.
[163:11.72]Fabulous.
[163:12.60]We'll escort you to your room.
[163:13.46]Is that me?
[163:28.31]What is the point of this?
[163:29.27]How do I get out of here?
[163:38.00]Oh, was I under the bed?
[163:39.36]No, that was weird.
[163:46.70]What is this?
[163:48.34]No light switch.
[163:50.89]Okay.
[163:52.23]Was that really worth 200 gold coins?
[163:58.97]Um, so I just spent $200 to make a goofy sound and crawl under a bed.
[164:07.76]Hope it was worth it.
[164:10.52]Ooh, room service.
[164:11.56]Got my CET, of course I do.
[164:12.88]No you don't.
[164:18.11]Oh, what's going on with Toxic Avenger over here?
[164:20.85]Oh my god, Toxic Avenger.
[164:22.25]Let's see what he wants to do.
[164:24.25]He's busy.
[164:25.33]Oh my goodness.
[164:29.52]I hear shuffling.
[164:30.28]Seems like you could put something under the door.
[164:33.04]Yeah, put.
[164:34.66]But you didn't have anything appealing.
[164:38.20]Cinnamon bun?
[164:42.05]Yeah.
[164:44.21]It's locked from the inside.
[164:45.75]I don't have anything.
[164:46.51]Uh... Well, I need to buy things.
[164:49.83]Hey, Burger Man!
[165:00.13]Well, what's your future?
[165:02.69]Nothing changes.

[165:37.16]Is that really worth getting?
[165:38.36]Attack up in battle.
[165:46.77]That steak.
[165:47.69]I'm not buying that steak.
[165:49.39]No gosh darn way.

[170:12.42]What happened?
[170:14.46]What?
[170:17.04]What?
[170:17.24]What happened?
[170:18.40]What just happened?
[170:29.67]I was like reading the chat and I just apparently took the elevator.
[170:33.97]Where did I go?
[170:46.80]Ugh, the scenic route, the infinite loop.
[170:48.97]Yeah, that's a good one.
[170:53.77]Oh god, wait.
[170:57.73]I need to get my composure for a second.

[171:34.92]Let's go.
[171:35.93]Shake out the cobwebs.
[171:37.85]This is the final battle.
[171:39.41]I better be ready for it.
[171:42.11]Dum-de-dum-dum.
[171:44.27]Oh, is someone there?
[171:47.15]Just a moment.
[171:49.21]I've almost finished watering these flowers.
[171:53.50]What's with the flowers?
[171:55.74]Here we are.

[173:16.13]Oh.
[173:16.25]Ooh.
[173:18.43]Okay.
[173:19.09]So that might have been sitting over here if I didn't accidentally kill that person, I think.
[173:26.89]Okay.
[173:28.51]How tense.
[173:30.19]Just think of it like a visit to the dentist.
[173:35.92]Why are they so weird?
[173:38.11]Why are they so weird?
[173:38.89]This is the problem I had in the beginning of the game with Toriel.
[173:42.35]They're just weird.
[173:45.75]She kept on telling me, like, oh, you're such a good boy.
[173:48.81]Here's a bunch of cakes.
[173:50.39]Don't leave.
[173:51.21]Don't leave, child.
[173:53.67]What is he doing?
[173:54.33]Why are they both weird?
[173:55.85]Why couldn't you just, like, just tell me straight what's going on?
[174:01.18]Are you ready?
[174:01.78]If you are not, I understand.
[174:04.46]Not ready either.
[174:09.36]The end.
[174:10.10]Okay.
[174:17.02]That's a long hallway.
[174:20.50]This is the barrier.
[174:23.46]This is what keeps us all trapped underground.
[174:28.39]If by chance you have any unfinished business, please do what you must.
[174:35.91]Uh...
[174:43.48]I guess we're just gonna go, this is my first playthrough, I mean... Whatever.
[174:47.78]Just go, continue, we're going.
[174:52.51]We're just going.
[174:53.35]I don't care.
[174:53.81]I see.
[174:56.45]This is it then.
[174:57.83]This is the end.
[175:03.65]Ready?
[175:06.21]I guess I'm ready.
[175:08.73]Hey look, there's one missing!
[175:11.62]a strange light fills the room twilight is shining through the barrier seems your journey is finally over you're filled with determination human it was nice to meet you goodbye uh
[175:42.10]What?
[175:46.26]Asgore attacks.
[175:50.58]Oh, he's so nice, guys.
[175:52.02]What a nice guy.
[175:52.96]Let's talk.
[175:55.74]There was nothing to say.
[175:56.67]I didn't know that was going to happen.
[176:03.01]Check.
[176:03.31]80 attack, 80 defense.
[176:15.77]So I gotta kill him, right?
[176:16.63]Alright, well, I think I'm just gonna have to start smashing him.
[176:29.76]I killed the queen.
[176:30.78]Time to kill the king.
[176:31.56]Checkmate.
[176:33.07]You know what I mean?
[176:34.23]Time to kill the king.
[176:34.87]Let's get a checkmate going here, guys.
[176:45.47]How much does that heal?
[176:47.15]Junk food.
[176:48.11]Eat it.
[176:59.42]He's not talking.
[177:02.76]I'm gonna have to checkmate him.
[177:06.06]Honestly, he's not showing any signs of remorse.
[177:10.74]Time to checkmate.
[177:13.80]Sorry.
[177:21.20]Do I have anything?
[177:21.68]Give him the shoes.
[177:23.86]Oh, shit.
[177:25.06]I just equipped the fucking shoes.
[177:28.98]Alright, it's fucking... It's time to kill.
[177:38.89]Did I not get hit?
[177:39.71]Come on!
[178:02.55]Alright, now you're getting on my nerves.
[178:16.70]Nothing to say.
[178:17.30]He's got nothing to say to me.
[178:20.53]There's nothing I can do.
[178:27.39]I just have to keep punching him in the stomach.
[178:39.64]Whoops!
[178:41.00]Alright, I gotta fucking sit up.
[178:52.15]That's what we're talking about.
[178:53.21]Should I check?
[178:55.02]More junk food?
[178:56.46]No, not right now.
[179:10.54]With his eyes.
[179:11.12]Okay, it's his eyes.
[179:12.34]I get it.
[179:13.38]Junk food.
[179:19.88]God!
[179:21.42]Messing up that pattern.
[179:30.76]Now that's fucking kind of hard.
[179:41.20]I might not beat this the first try.
[179:42.68]I gotta beat him the first try.
[179:51.53]Oh god.
[179:52.75]Holy dog shit.
[179:54.10]I don't even know.
[179:55.00]Did I get hit?
[179:55.52]I don't know.
[179:56.12]Junk food.
[180:10.22]He's at half health.
[180:11.02]Should I try talking to him again?
[180:17.54]Couple more hits.
[180:25.38]Fuck.
[180:28.52]You have anything to say?
[180:30.20]Anything at all to say?
[180:32.52]Now would be a good time to say it.
[180:38.01]Junk food.
[180:39.23]Junk food.
[180:52.32]Only a few more hits.
[180:57.03]That is very hard to dodge.
[180:59.65]Okay, low HP.
[181:00.57]Low HP.
[181:02.15]Come on!
[181:02.75]You don't have anything to say with low health?
[181:06.43]Like, oh my, wait, before you kill me, I have something to tell you!
[181:11.69]Fucking checkmate.
[181:13.01]Sorry.
[181:14.93]Checkmate.
[181:15.39]Killed the queen and killed the king.
[181:18.07]Nothing I could do.
[181:18.65]I tried.
[181:21.91]I tried.
[181:25.72]So that is how it is.
[181:27.66]It is.
[181:27.88]I remember the day after my son died.
[181:31.70]The entire underground was devoid of hope.
[181:37.71]The future had once again been taken from us by the humans.
[181:43.10]In a fit of anger, I declared war.
[181:47.12]I said that I would destroy any human that came here.
[181:51.11]I would use their souls to become godlike.
[181:54.89]Free us from this terrible prison.
[181:58.09]And I would destroy humanity.
[181:59.51]See?
[181:59.71]I mean, look at this guy.
[182:01.25]And let monsters rule the surface in peace.
[182:04.67]Soon the people's hopes returned.
[182:07.11]My wife, however, became disgusted with my actions.
[182:11.14]She left this place never to be seen again.
[182:15.36]And then I killed her.
[182:17.22]Accidentally.
[182:18.60]It was an accident.
[182:20.48]Truthfully, I do not want power.
[182:23.66]I do not want to hurt anyone.
[182:26.04]I just wanted everyone to have hope.
[182:29.14]But I cannot take this any longer.
[182:31.79]I just want to see my wife.
[182:34.79]I just want to see my child.
[182:37.01]Please, young one, this war has gone on long enough.
[182:42.35]You have the power.
[182:43.95]Take my soul and leave this cursed place.
[182:51.46]Oh, now they're giving me the choice.
[183:00.25]What happens if I... What happens if I don't kill him?
[183:04.79]What do I do?
[183:07.27]What do I do?
[183:11.65]What do I do?
[183:12.75]Spare him?
[183:14.86]Just spare him.
[183:19.66]Alright, we have...
[183:21.42]I don't know.
[183:23.52]I don't know.
[183:24.76]It's pulling me.
[183:27.96]But no.
[183:30.92]I'm fighting it.
[183:32.82]It's like the dark side of the force.
[183:36.54]Yes, Anakin.
[183:38.39]Anakin, yes.
[183:40.17]Go to the dark side.
[183:42.89]I can't.
[183:44.43]I don't know.
[183:46.61]I did it.
[183:52.52]After everything I have done to hurt you, you would rather stay down here and suffer than live happily on the surface.
[184:03.31]Yeah, I killed your wife.
[184:04.65]I mean, it's the... What do I do?
[184:07.65]You know?
[184:12.37]Human, I promise you, for as long as you remain here, my wife and I will...
[184:24.54]Oh, no.
[184:27.05]Oh, no.
[184:28.11]Does he know?
[184:29.41]What if I just say I didn't do it?
[184:30.63]What if I tell him she, like, fell down the stairs?
[184:32.73]Yeah, you know, your wife, she... Ah, it was crazy.
[184:39.03]I went over there.
[184:39.91]She was giving me coffee and tea, and she had too much shit in her hands, and she fucking, like, stumbled down and tumbled down the stairs.
[184:45.49]What do I do?
[184:46.31]Okay.
[184:47.45]Uh, we can sit in the living room telling stories.
[184:52.08]Eating butterscotch pie.
[184:53.48]We could be like, like a family.
[185:04.43]That's the flower.
[185:05.17]That's the flower guy doing that.
[185:06.81]I didn't do it.
[185:07.21]That's the flower guy that did that.
[185:08.25]He was in the beginning of the game.
[185:09.15]I can tell because I can tell.
[185:10.51]Yep, I knew it.
[185:15.24]I had the fucking flower.
[185:16.14]There he is, you little bastard.
[185:19.06]You idiot.
[185:20.40]You haven't learned a thing.
[185:22.67]In this world, it's kill or be killed.
[185:27.99]I knew it.
[185:33.08]What is he doing?
[185:37.96]My fucking game turned off.
[185:43.21]My game just turned off.
[185:44.73]I don't have a game right now.
[185:45.79]What happened?
[185:47.35]Where did the game go?
[185:48.45]Where did the game go?
[185:54.96]I crashed.
[185:58.96]What?
[186:01.49]Is that what happens?
[186:06.65]He turns off your game?
[186:08.65]Hold on.
[186:12.35]Why does he turn your game off?
[186:15.89]Can I come back in?
[186:16.59]Do I have to go back to the save?
[186:20.70]Hold on.
[186:23.54]Okay, long ago to- yeah.
[186:26.42]The fuck is happening?
[186:36.18]What?
[186:38.16]Continue or restart?
[186:39.59]What am I- should I go?
[186:41.19]Should I go with the flower?
[186:45.99]I'm going- I'm gonna continue.
[186:49.69]Right?
[186:57.92]What's going on?
[187:03.34]I can't, I cannot save.
[187:05.25]What the fuck?
[187:07.41]File erased?
[187:11.35]I knew he was a bad guy from the very beginning and he was bad and evil and mean.
[187:15.79]Howdy.
[187:16.21]It's me, Flowey.
[187:18.55]Flowey the Flower.
[187:20.19]I owe you a huge thanks.
[187:22.05]You really did a number on that old fool.
[187:24.67]Without you, I never could have gotten past him.
[187:27.89]But now, with your help, he's dead.
[187:31.98]And I've got the human souls.
[187:35.96]Okay, this guy's fucked.
[187:37.94]Boy, I've been empty for so long.
[187:40.34]It feels great to have it.
[187:41.96]Wait, he's a human.
[187:45.13]Did he say human soul?
[187:46.21]I thought the... It's great to have a soul inside me again.
[187:52.25]I can feel them wriggling.
[187:54.73]Aw, you're feeling left out, aren't you?
[187:56.73]Well, that's just perfect.
[187:58.76]After all, I only have six souls.
[188:00.68]I still need one more before I become God.
[188:04.10]And then, with my newfound powers, monsters, humans, everyone will die.
[188:11.92]I'll kill them.
[188:13.16]This guy's fucking freaking me out.
[188:21.45]Oh, and forget about escaping your old save file.
[188:25.70]It's gone forever.
[188:27.90]But don't worry.
[188:29.04]Your old friend Flowey has worked out a replacement for you.
[188:33.16]I'll save over your own death so you can watch me tear you to bloody pieces.
[188:40.53]Over and over and over.
[188:45.55]Do you really think you can stop me?
[188:50.14]You really are an idiot.
[189:00.74]Uh... What's going on?
[189:07.74]This is a gigantic, terrible looking thing.
[189:18.05]What?
[189:19.73]Ugh.
[189:21.03]Whoa.
[189:25.11]What the hell?
[189:29.75]Oh.
[189:30.31]My.
[189:30.81]Fucking.
[189:31.31]God.
[189:32.49]What is with the TV screen?
[189:34.09]There's like people screaming.
[189:37.81]Fight him.
[189:39.15]Punch him.
[189:42.45]You just lose.
[189:43.17]You lose this, right?
[189:43.85]You just lose this, right?
[189:45.05]You have to just like fucking lose it.
[189:51.01]What do I do?
[189:52.99]There is... I'm dead.
[189:54.77]This is all just a bad dream.
[190:05.39]That was scary.
[190:06.25]And you're never waking up.
[190:16.95]No, stop.
[190:18.13]Don't crash my game again.
[190:23.38]Boy.
[190:23.86]What the hell?
[190:29.54]He keeps turning off my game.
[190:35.76]Did you really think I was going to be satisfied killing you only one time?
[190:39.75]I got too cocky.
[190:49.13]I got a little cocky there and turns out
[190:53.77]Turns out I can't.
[190:54.67]Turns out I probably can't win.
[190:59.24]Alright, here's the secret strategy.
[191:00.68]Just stand in this corner right here and don't move.
[191:07.50]This is terrifying.
[191:24.31]I only did one damage to him?
[191:28.41]Is this beatable?
[191:29.59]Can you actually beat this if you try really hard?
[191:31.73]This is all just a bad dream.
[191:41.58]I wonder if my game is going to turn off.
[191:43.04]You're never waking up?
[191:57.36]Stop doing that.
[191:59.19]I don't like when he does that.
[192:05.17]Pathetic.
[192:06.75]Now you really are gonna die.
[192:11.13]Is there something I'm missing?
[192:14.42]I'm missing something, right?
[192:20.10]Am I supposed to do something where, like, I blow up the Death Star?
[192:23.40]There's like one spot on his toe that you hit with like a certain movement and he explodes.
[192:27.27]That has to be it.
[192:28.11]Let's do it.
[192:28.55]Let's find it.
[192:28.99]I'm gonna fly right into his mouth.
[192:33.20]Wait, where am I?
[192:36.46]Where am I?
[192:39.72]Oh, I thought I was like in a secret hidden place.
[192:54.34]I've improved at one percent.
[193:10.82]Damn it.
[193:14.42]Hold on, hold on, I gotta like go, where's my like, I gotta keep like opening up my Steam.
[193:26.19]What happens if I uninstall the game?
[193:27.73]Can you even realize what will happen if you defeat me?
[193:47.87]Can I do anything?
[193:49.05]Do I have a menu?
[193:51.15]Doesn't look like it.
[194:01.18]What did that just say?
[194:02.28]What did that just say?
[194:08.72]No, I think I figured you out.
[194:09.92]I figured you out.
[194:10.56]Fuck you.
[194:12.08]Fuck him, right?
[194:13.37]I quit.
[194:17.13]He can't kill me now.
[194:18.21]Now I'm going to reload the game.
[194:19.25]He's going to be... Watch this.
[194:21.65]Watch this.
[194:27.06]See, he's going to be like, oh, you found my secret.
[194:29.38]You left the game.
[194:33.99]Aw, damn it.
[194:34.55]That wasn't it.
[194:35.11]That didn't work.
[195:00.34]I have to beat this fucking guy.
[195:10.65]It's not about the TV.
[195:11.59]Wait, can I change the channel?
[195:14.79]Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.
[195:17.45]Figured it out.
[195:19.99]File, three, save.
[195:26.89]File, three, save.
[195:28.27]Do I have to, like, go delete that save file in my fucking Steam folder?
[195:50.27]I'm gonna go delete save three.
[195:59.77]I hope I don't fuck up my whole game.
[196:06.07]Don't you get it?
[196:07.69]There's no such thing as happy endings.
[196:11.65]This is all that's left.
[196:13.53]Oh, gee, alright.
[196:15.13]I just need to learn to dodge, apparently.
[196:24.06]Okay, I get up.
[196:26.22]No, my gunner objects.
[196:27.81]They're on.
[196:28.65]I got my gunners on, guys.
[196:29.79]That means you know it's serious.
[196:32.89]And I'm just gonna be quiet.
[197:08.09]What's going on?
[197:09.01]What is happening?
[197:09.53]What does that mean?
[197:10.33]What's going on?
[197:10.75]What does that mean?
[197:15.09]Oh, god damn it.
[197:22.08]I called for help.
[197:23.06]Help me.
[197:23.44]Help me.
[197:25.72]Help me.
[197:26.20]Somebody help me.
[197:29.98]Holy shit.
[197:30.80]I'm being healed.
[197:36.70]oh my god I can't do it I have to move I have to move around right
[198:17.54]Somebody please help me.
[198:18.64]Why can't somebody come in here with a spear and throw it in his stomach?
[198:21.05]I need more than that.
[198:25.67]I need more than that!
[198:31.50]What is he doing?
[198:39.52]What's going on?
[198:40.46]What the fuck is happening?
[198:42.71]He keeps loading different saves!
[198:53.78]Help!
[198:54.10]Help me!
[198:54.56]This is it, I'm gonna back up.
[199:40.86]Fuckin' bugs!
[199:49.24]Fuck, I don't... Oh, come on!
[199:58.41]I s- I should've dodged that.
[200:10.22]Love?
[200:10.50]Happiness?
[200:11.94]Relief?
[200:30.55]Kill him.
[200:31.15]Somebody kill him.
[200:35.23]Oh my god, I don't want to lose this.
[200:47.71]Give it to me!
[200:51.05]Give me full health.
[201:00.70]Oh, I'm like, so sweating.
[201:22.39]Oh no, oh no.
[201:41.41]Where is it, where is it, where is it?
[201:48.05]Shooting happy bullets at me.
[201:51.49]No!
[201:52.91]Fuck!
[201:58.07]Come on, come on, give me strength.
[201:59.81]Do I touch them?
[202:00.43]Do I touch them?
[202:01.03]Do I touch them?
[202:15.72]Wowie's defense dropped to zero.
[202:22.08]He's going to die quicker than this!
[202:59.68]Jesus Christ!
[203:00.66]He's getting it.
[203:40.14]I'm starting to see colors!
[203:51.03]I'm gonna lose because of... Oh god, I gotta put this down.
[204:07.92]No, it's just like, oh, it's like all blending together.
[204:10.42]Did I win?
[204:12.14]This can't be happening.
[204:17.78]You, you, what?
[204:23.10]You idiot.
[204:27.92]What?
[204:29.55]What the fuck?
[204:30.41]Okay.
[204:41.14]Did you really think you could defeat me?
[204:44.06]I'm the god of this world.
[204:45.78]And you, you're hopeless.
[204:48.22]Hopeless and alone.
[204:50.16]Golly, that's right.
[204:51.90]You're worthless, friends.
[204:54.52]Can't save you now.
[204:56.20]Call for help, I dare you.
[204:59.19]Cry into the darkness.
[205:00.95]Mommy, daddy, somebody help.
[205:03.43]See what good it does you.
[205:06.01]He called for help.
[205:13.19]But nobody came.
[205:15.31]Boy, what a shame.
[205:17.63]Nobody else is going to get to see you die.
[205:20.33]I'm going to dodge it.
[205:24.05]I can dodge it.
[205:25.21]I can dodge it, right?
[205:25.73]Can I dodge it?
[205:28.55]What?
[205:32.49]What?
[205:33.07]Yeah, he said... How'd you... Well, I'll just... Load failed.
[205:43.63]Where are my powers?
[205:48.11]The souls.
[205:50.19]What are they doing?
[205:50.83]Can I help too?
[205:54.75]I want to be in an... You're supposed to obey me.
[206:00.08]Stop it.
[206:01.50]Stop it.
[206:01.90]Okay.
[206:20.41]Now this is a decision I don't know what to do.
[206:23.29]I want to fucking just bury the axe right into his head.
[206:27.74]But... Everything I've been shown so far is that you can't...
[206:53.76]I think I'm gonna kill him.
[206:57.42]I think I'm gonna kill him.
[207:00.50]This guy was a son of a bitch since the very beginning of the game.
[207:06.78]I was told not to.
[207:08.12]I was told you gotta be a good person no matter what.
[207:12.14]But some motherfuckers kinda just deserve it, right?
[207:15.30]Like, in this world, this guy deserves it, right?
[207:18.98]Kill or be killed is what I was told.
[207:20.86]I was told kill or be killed.
[207:29.20]This is the hardest decision I've had to make in the last at least, like, five days.
[207:35.41]The decision before this that was as hard as this was probably choosing what toilet paper to buy at the grocery store.
[207:42.57]Because that was, that took me about 15 straight minutes.
[207:44.62]I'm gonna regret this.
[207:56.09]What are you doing?
[207:56.85]Do you really think I've learned anything from this?
[208:00.45]No.
[208:10.96]You get one more chance, buddy.
[208:13.62]Sparing me won't change anything.
[208:14.90]Killing me is the only way to end this.
[208:16.40]You get... I said it was one more chance.
[208:19.77]You... If you let me live, I'll come back...
[208:25.53]Oh, you... I so badly want to kill you now.
[208:33.95]What would... He just... He wants me to do it.
[208:43.66]I feel like if I kill him, he's going to shoot out acid on me.
[208:46.72]Like, he's going to throw up on me and be like, Yeah, yes, I told you not to... You're poisoned for the rest of your life.
[208:54.93]I'll kill you.
[208:55.55]I so badly want to kill it.
[208:59.39]I want to kill it.
[209:02.13]What?
[209:02.89]I was told that you got... I don't want to be the bad guy.
[209:07.89]You're getting rot in a prison.
[209:10.71]I'll kill everyone.
[209:11.99]Okay, now he's getting fucked up.
[209:16.32]You know, threatening me is one thing.
[209:17.88]Threatening everybody is another thing, buddy.
[209:23.12]What would, yeah, you know what, what would Benjamin Franklin do?
[209:28.78]What would Benjamin Franklin do in this situation?
[209:33.70]Ben Franklin would have, you know what, you know what Ben Franklin would have done?
[209:38.59]Ladies and gentlemen, this is what Ben Franklin would have done.
[209:42.89]I have the upper hand here, right?
[209:45.95]Ben Franklin, knowing that he has the upper hand,
[209:50.68]We'll just see what he can get out of him.
[209:52.02]See what he can do.
[209:52.62]You know, just keep him talking.
[209:55.04]He's powerless.
[209:55.68]Yeah, really.
[209:59.38]Will you?
[210:00.04]I have the upper hand.
[210:00.80]I can listen to whatever the hell you have to say.
[210:02.73]And then I can choose at that point.
[210:10.11]Ben Franklin would have used diplomacy.
[210:16.69]See?
[210:22.37]Why am I being so nice to you?
[210:24.51]Because I killed a character in the beginning of the game.
[210:28.13]Ben Franklin would not have done that.
[210:30.71]And I'm repenting against that.
[210:33.83]I can't understand.
[210:34.53]Yeah.
[210:36.05]I made a mistake in the very beginning of the game.
[210:37.57]I killed... I killed Toriel in the very beginning.
[210:40.79]You know what?
[210:42.39]I've seen the errors in my ways.
[210:45.41]And now I'm making him sad.
[210:52.17]Flowley ran away.
[210:57.35]Saturday, thanks for stopping dude.
[211:01.84]See now, but Ben Franklin would have, probably would have made sure he didn't get away.
[211:10.94]Now what?
[211:12.92]What, what is, what is there left to do?
[211:26.50]What?
[211:33.50]Where the hell?
[211:36.54]Was that it?
[211:36.88]Did I win?
[211:41.71]What happened?
[211:44.65]Where did I go?
[211:45.83]Where did I go?
[211:56.95]What, did I just walk in to... Oh, my phone's ringing.
[212:05.65]Hey.
[212:06.60]Is anyone there?
[212:08.56]No, I'll just leave a message.
[212:09.54]Since you left, things down here are different.
[212:14.76]With Asgore gone, Undyne became the ruler of the Underground.
[212:19.05]She's decided to destroy every human that comes here.
[212:22.73]What the f...
[212:24.24]Since the human souls disappeared, she's also looking for a new way to break the barrier.
[212:29.65]And when she does, she's going to wage war on humanity.
[212:32.01]Good luck.
[212:32.37]I mean, that was Asgore's plan, too.
[212:35.23]But he was really, uh, bad at it.
[212:38.11]Undyne has also expanded the Royal Guard massively.
[212:40.51]She says the first thing she'll do after we get out of here is take her army and personally hunt you down and destroy you.
[212:48.93]After I gave you a glass of water,
[212:51.27]And I didn't kill you?
[212:53.16]You saw my fucking goddamn humanity.
[212:56.62]Meanwhile, I've been knocking on the door to the ruins, but that woman hasn't been answering me.
[213:02.14]Maybe she's not feeling well.
[213:04.30]Hey, Sans.
[213:05.36]Who are you talking to?
[213:07.44]Oh, just the human.
[213:08.97]Oh, cool.
[213:11.51]Wait, did you say the human?
[213:13.19]Can I talk to them?
[213:15.11]Sure, knock yourself out.
[213:16.90]Hey, I'm Dines the Empress now.
[213:18.64]It's amazing.
[213:19.54]And she appointed me to be the most important royal position.
[213:24.72]That's it.
[213:25.62]That's literally the title.
[213:27.50]What do I do?
[213:28.60]She told me to stand around and look cute.
[213:31.86]Well, that's the perfect job for me.
[213:34.72]I do that all the time when I'm trying.
[213:38.11]Finally, I'm important.
[213:39.97]And it's all thanks to you.
[213:40.93]See, they like me.
[213:42.53]They fucking like me.
[213:45.19]I'm going back down there.
[213:47.48]The horrible things he did.
[213:49.70]Thank you, human.
[213:50.68]Come back and visit sometime.
[213:52.10]Wait, Undyne would probably kill you, but you'd get to see me.
[213:55.93]So you gotta risk it.
[213:57.83]You gotta.
[213:58.87]See you soon.
[214:00.53]Uh-huh.
[214:06.35]There he is.
[214:08.40]Hey.
[214:10.22]Since you defeated me, I've been thinking.
[214:12.66]Is killing things really necessary?
[214:16.84]I honestly don't know anymore.
[214:19.06]I have a request for you.
[214:20.82]Prove to me, prove to me you are strong enough to survive.
[214:24.85]Get here from the beginning, without killing a single thing.
[214:29.35]And I won't kill the king.
[214:30.35]Then you'll have your so-called happy ending.
[214:34.49]So what will it be?
[214:36.01]Will you prove yourself?
[214:37.77]Or will I get to watch you suffer?
[214:39.73]Either way, I'm interested.
[214:42.70]Hehehe.
[214:53.30]Alright.
[214:56.13]Well, I guess I beat it.
[215:01.45]Do it.
[215:01.75]I'm not gonna do it right now.
[215:03.93]Yeah, I messed up the pacifist ending because I accidentally killed Toriel.
[215:11.90]I know, I'm sorry.
[215:15.72]For all of you that are here, I will explain.
[215:18.06]Let me explain before I go.
[215:22.02]The flower in the beginning started to hurt me.
[215:24.44]Right?
[215:26.43]Started to attack me.
[215:27.51]Told me I was an idiot.
[215:31.29]Told me that I can't trust anybody.
[215:33.97]And I decided not to.
[215:35.61]The next character I met, I killed.
[215:37.09]Because I was told, this is the land of monsters and everyone's trying to eat you and kill you and shit.
[215:41.63]That's why I killed her.
[215:42.29]I mean, can I... Is there anything else to do?
[215:46.76]No, that's the... Okay.
[215:48.36]Okay.
[215:52.92]So the only question I have, I see people write after the first time playing it.
[215:59.88]So there are three endings then?
[216:03.67]There's the you just kind of played through the game.
[216:08.71]And then there's the you killed everything.
[216:11.97]And then the you didn't kill anything at all.
[216:17.66]Okay.
[216:18.94]Well, that's cool.
[216:21.10]I enjoyed the game.
[216:25.51]I had a good time.
[216:29.71]There's a lot of things I didn't see that would be fun.
[216:32.75]So I would guess you would classify this as a neutral run, right?
[216:40.04]Kill nobody is the good, okay, so you can't kill anything.
[216:43.98]I mean anything, right?
[216:45.50]If I step on a frog, is that okay?
[216:49.66]If I don't kill anybody, but I somehow
[216:53.46]Like step on a bug.
[217:05.70]Okay.
[217:06.92]Absolutely nothing.
[217:08.80]Can't kill anything.
[217:09.80]Okay.
[217:10.10]Got it.
[217:10.48]That's cool.
[217:12.18]Alright.
[217:12.46]Well, I mean, I don't know if I'll stream it.
[217:14.30]I would, I might just kind of off stream, maybe play it.
[217:19.27]Depends.
[217:19.79]I mean,
[217:22.22]That was fun, though.
[217:22.98]That was a really good experience.
[217:24.14]That was a fun game.
[217:31.90]Technically, there's five endings.
[217:33.64]Really?
[217:35.90]Well, not five.
[217:36.62]Alright, well, guys.
[217:40.75]I missed a lot of subs, I think, so I'm really, really, really fucking sorry if I didn't, like, see that you subscribed.
[217:48.19]I was avoiding chat and avoiding...
[217:51.57]Anything like that.
[217:52.47]So I spent most of the time eyes on this screen.
[217:56.63]So I apologize if I missed you.
[217:57.90]But thanks for watching.
[218:00.72]There's a bunch of people here today.
[218:01.74]So that's pretty cool.
[218:03.50]Thanks for coming, everybody.
[218:04.32]Appreciate it.
[218:06.74]That's gonna be it.
[218:08.10]I think I'm probably what time is it right now?
[218:10.00]What is the actual time?
[218:12.46]What time would have been stream?
[218:13.40]It's like 11 o'clock Eastern.
[218:15.90]Yeah, I should probably get to bed.
