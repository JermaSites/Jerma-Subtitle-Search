[00:57.67]I like an hour ago I was like oh I think they're gonna do that I knew that I know that's going on I didn't intend to try to get here on time but I did I just I happen to be sitting here you're a minute late what no I've started I that you know you just because you clicked on the notification a minute after I went live doesn't mean I went live when you clicked it insider trading
[01:28.14]Anyways, how you guys doing?
[01:28.90]Hope you're doing well.
[01:31.30]We're going to do... I'm going to make a lot of people really sad and really angry probably when I say this, but I'm going to say it and here we go.
[01:39.54]This is week two where I have told you that we were going to play a first party Nintendo game.
[01:46.34]It didn't happen.
[01:47.80]Last week was Paper Mario.
[01:49.03]That got delayed.
[01:50.57]And this week was supposed to be Pikmin 2.
[01:52.07]That got delayed too.
[01:55.53]The plan is to do that.

[01:59.79]I'm supposed to have it tomorrow or the next day.
[02:07.30]Coin game is way better, but that's the best part.
[02:10.40]We found out
[02:12.91]That coin game got a major update.
[02:16.86]There's a new arcade.
[02:17.86]There's a mini golf course.
[02:19.04]There's eight new games.
[02:20.80]And there's a survival game.
[02:22.34]Survival mode.
[02:24.10]So.
[02:26.06]And this is one of my favorite games on Steam.
[02:27.52]So if there's a major update for it, I'm going to play it.
[02:30.66]Also, I have a schedule for you for this week.

[03:19.29]No.
[03:21.49]They're not lies.

[06:10.50]Do you guys do two steps at a time or one step at a time on a staircase?
[06:16.57]Going up.
[06:18.99]Going down, it's always one for me.
[06:22.81]Going up, it's always two.
[06:25.01]But us two-step chads, that comes with a little bit of a problem.
[06:32.54]you might miss and go happens a lot or you might not get your footing correct and then you hit the part of your knee right where your shin connects to your knee and it just hurts for the next like three days what the hell why do I have this many viewers what's going on what's happening

[07:12.20]Or is this lag?
[07:13.58]I have negative 10,000 viewers?
[07:17.98]What?
[07:18.34]What just happened?
[07:24.71]Oh shit!

[07:40.19]We're going to play the coin game, as you know.
[07:45.36]They all left.
[07:46.40]I don't even know what happened.
[07:47.82]I didn't see a raid or anything.
[07:48.82]Alright, should I do survival or should I do... Because there's a new... What should I do?
[07:59.64]It was a raid?
[08:00.36]How come I don't see it?
[08:01.20]Wait, did a raid... I missed it?
[08:03.16]I don't see it anywhere on any dashboards or anything or any...

[08:36.67]How do you survive it like an arcade?
[08:41.68]Raid song Let me see if I can get this
[09:09.70]I'm just the annoying guy at the Best Buy that's at the fucking Casio keyboard just turning it on and pressing buttons.
[09:21.25]I can't do two things at once.
[09:25.13]Hey, take a look at this keyboard we have over here.
[09:27.54]Yeah, it's a good one.
[09:28.80]It's got organs.
[09:30.30]It's got every trumpet you could imagine.
[09:31.90]It's got an amazing orchestra.
[09:33.32]Get out of the way!
[09:36.38]Sir, I... Sir, you're getting hands all over... I'll take it!
[09:42.19]And then you see the price tag, and those things are like fucking $4,000.
[09:47.41]And then you go, ooh!
[09:49.29]And you back up like slowly, Jim Carrey style.
[09:51.69]Alright, what were we doing?
[09:55.43]Anyways, thanks for the raid.
[09:59.26]Thanks, Ludwig.
[10:00.06]Welcome, everybody.
[10:04.02]Health and energy system in place.
[10:06.12]Work odd jobs or scavenge to earn money.
[10:08.12]Pawn your prizes to get cash to keep going.
[10:14.01]Eat junk food to stay healthy.
[10:15.69]That doesn't make any sense.
[10:17.93]Keep mom happy by making your nightly curfew.
[10:20.55]How many days can you last?
[10:24.77]Survival mode involves eating junk food and soda to keep your health up.
[10:27.30]Work odd jobs around the island.
[10:28.52]This sounds like fun.
[10:30.22]Or scavenge for junk in the trash to earn money.
[10:32.64]Turn on face cam?
[10:34.50]No, I can't.
[10:37.52]No, I'm not ready for a face cam.
[10:39.36]I'm not ready for a face cam.
[10:40.76]Alright, what if I... No, I can't do the thing that everybody copies and pastes.
[10:45.49]I have to stop.
[10:46.65]If I say I'm not going to do something, I can't do it.
[10:49.69]Otherwise, you'll have fuel to put that anywhere.
[10:54.38]Are you naked?
[10:55.08]No, I'm not naked.
[10:56.50]How do I look today?
[10:59.72]Actually... I kinda look pretty damn good.
[11:04.45]I can keep it on.
[11:10.67]Is it delayed?
[11:11.21]Wait.
[11:17.29]Is it delayed?
[11:17.71]It's very blue.
[11:20.13]Well, it won't be in a minute.
[11:22.66]How about just really tiny?
[11:23.96]I don't want a face cam on.
[11:25.68]I'm not a face cam streamer.
[11:26.82]You guys already know that.
[11:27.58]I only face cam during horror games, VR, and when I have to eat Burger King on stream.
[11:37.50]Alright, let's go.
[11:39.24]It's delayed?
[11:39.92]It looks like it is.
[11:40.64]Why?
[11:43.48]Shouldn't be.
[11:43.84]Alright, well, whatever.
[11:49.44]I'm going to turn it off randomly.
[11:50.68]Prediction started.
[11:53.37]What?
[11:55.90]Win channel points if you make the correct prediction.
[11:58.22]What's a prediction?
[11:58.84]What is this?
[11:59.18]What are you guys voting on?
[12:01.36]Predict with channel points.
[12:05.95]I can't even see what this is.
[12:09.75]Will Jerma... What is it?
[12:10.99]Will Jerma beat Dizzy Bird?
[12:16.40]Will Jerma play Dizzy Bird as the first game?
[12:22.82]Well, I can't almost, but I will now.
[12:25.13]I wasn't supposed to look.
[12:28.29]Well, I don't have that information.
[12:29.69]All right.
[12:37.82]Survival.
[12:38.30]Let's go.
[12:39.48]This will delete.
[12:40.20]Who cares?
[12:43.00]I have to eat food out of the trash.
[12:44.44]Just live.
[12:47.46]I want a refund.
[12:48.53]We did it.
[12:49.03]We got a refund.
[12:51.73]Anybody want any dirt water?
[13:01.02]Eddie and the Ticket Eaters.

[13:45.25]Can you guys hear this?
[13:48.44]Okay, I'm not going to look.
[13:50.58]I saw the prediction started.
[13:51.40]I'm not going to look at it.
[13:52.68]If I look over here, you know I'm cheating.
[13:53.92]I can't look over here and chat.
[13:56.63]Uh, this is... Yeah, I know this is the best game on Steam.
[13:58.79]I know it's, uh, tab.

[14:25.19]Okay, um...
[14:28.78]How do I... I'll stop, right?
[14:32.72]Okay, there's the map.
[14:34.34]Can I move this around?
[14:37.93]How do I accept a quest?
[14:43.95]What do I have in the coin game?
[14:46.61]I can't look at chat.
[14:47.73]I didn't see anything, but I'm going to look over there.
[14:54.64]Actually, wait.
[14:54.92]What is this?
[14:56.72]Soda Pop Tonic.
[14:58.50]Which... Soda Pop Tonic.
[15:00.75]Which one are... What is the... I don't... That's my Steam name.
[15:09.23]Okay.
[15:14.11]This is free.
[15:16.51]Well, there's like... There's sodas in here and shit.
[15:18.43]I don't know.
[15:21.91]I thought this was a soda popping, like, tonic machine.
[15:25.29]I'm not looking, I swear to God.
[15:26.99]I have no idea what you're predicting.
[15:29.37]I have absolutely no idea.
[15:30.79]I have no clue.
[15:38.66]I'm gonna get this, though.
[15:44.52]I want to look over there, but I fucking can't do it.
[15:49.51]I so badly want to look at you.
[15:52.73]Okay, what if there's something wrong with the stream?
[15:54.73]What if my bitrate went down or something?
[15:56.65]How am I ever going to know?
[15:58.05]I need to be able to look over there.
[16:00.16]And by the way, when am I going to know when this is over?
[16:04.28]I'm not going to know.
[16:04.98]What if I just did it?
[16:05.54]What if I already did it?
[16:06.76]How am I ever going to find out?
[16:11.47]And why are we giving these secret slime actions?
[16:14.95]Or predictions?
[16:15.45]I mean, it's kind of fun, but that is fun.
[16:18.17]Keep doing it.
[16:20.62]I can't talk to anybody.
[16:21.64]This feels weird.
[16:22.16]I don't like this.
[16:27.03]I don't like this.
[16:27.55]This feels strange.
[16:28.29]I'm just talking at the monitor.
[16:33.41]I'm very alone right now.
[16:34.81]I'm very aware of how alone I am in this room.
[16:37.43]Because I can't look over there and see everybody talking.
[16:42.53]What if they're trying to give me advice?
[16:51.18]This is freaking me out.
[16:52.86]Alright, it stopped.
[16:54.46]What happened?
[16:58.14]I saw the purple.
[17:01.74]Will Jerma beat the first game within five tries?
[17:09.34]I didn't know that's what was going on.
[17:16.25]I didn't know that's what you guys were doing.
[17:23.99]220 million go to hee-hahaha-poo-poo.
[17:28.03]I, like, can't believe that... You can have... Hee-hahaha-poo-poo-poo-poo is, like, a password you use for a website you know you're going to log into one time and never fucking open it again.
[17:50.92]Well, I can't beat that one.
[17:51.96]So, yes, I can.
[17:53.06]No, I can't.
[17:53.90]I need to survive.
[17:54.62]I need to eat food.
[17:55.32]Oh, it's just off the hook.
[18:04.61]Oh, wait, I can watch TV?
[18:09.05]When did they add all this?
[18:11.39]Oh, shoot.
[18:14.75]How do I press the buttons?
[18:16.43]Oh, E key.
[18:20.56]Get up here.
[18:22.14]Get up here and sit down.
[18:23.44]And sit down and watch TV with your friend.
[18:25.00]Boy, I just starved to death on the couch.
[18:37.48]Well, I gotta turn this up.
[18:42.00]Oh, it is up all the way.
[18:43.56]Really?
[18:48.90]You guys hear it?
[18:57.08]Dirt water?
[19:03.72]I fucking hate when you drink a coffee.
[19:06.58]Or anything.
[19:07.32]And you have the layer of ice.
[19:08.99]The ice layer.
[19:09.71]That you can't drink through.
[19:12.33]It pisses me off.
[19:13.11]Because now I can't even enjoy that coffee.
[19:20.89]I might as well just throw it away.
[19:25.46]Alright, let's get up.
[19:26.38]I want to just look at the new features.
[19:27.52]Can I play with the duck?
[19:32.78]Same.
[19:33.16]Did I brush my teeth?
[19:35.76]Yeah, I did.
[19:42.03]There's a fish tank too.
[19:50.75]I need to eat something.
[19:51.83]Okay, 41 energy, 78 health.
[19:53.93]I have $2.50.
[19:54.13]How do I get money?
[19:55.55]Oh, a flusher on top of the toilet.
[20:04.84]Oh, wait.
[20:05.10]You guys can't see this.
[20:05.90]I should probably move this.
[20:06.72]There, see?
[20:09.02]Now you can see what I'm talking about.
[20:11.39]Why face cam?
[20:11.99]Like, fuck face cam.
[20:13.23]I don't want to ever use it.
[20:14.15]Look at it.
[20:14.79]I just ruined the beginning of the game for you.
[20:22.29]50 gun.
[20:22.71]Alright, is this my mother?
[20:25.77]F key.
[20:28.18]Inventory.
[20:29.14]Did I just hit my mother in the face with a flashlight?
[20:38.84]Put the gun down.
[20:43.61]Oh, nice.
[20:44.09]Pizzas.
[20:45.51]Okay, I can take these.
[20:46.81]This is a Salisbury Steak TV dinner.
[20:48.99]How much food?
[20:49.51]What's my health at?
[20:52.45]Dinners must be cooked in the microwave before eating.
[20:56.15]Okay.
[20:59.77]Does the whole box go in?
[21:04.41]This looks actually kind of good.
[21:05.51]Oh, it's like the kid cuisines.
[21:09.58]I remember those.
[21:10.16]Those things were awesome.
[21:16.30]What's beeping?
[21:18.90]What is beeping?
[21:24.47]Alright, get that... Get over here.
[21:29.15]Do I have to take it out?
[21:37.17]This... I feel like this is a funny bit part of, like, a caveman movie.
[21:43.25]Like, caveman is in the real world now, and he's... He got, like, time-traveled or something, right?
[21:47.34]How do I turn it on?
[21:52.94]Set timer.
[21:56.38]How do I turn it on?
[22:01.42]Did you see someone?
[22:02.94]I missed what you said.
[22:04.68]How do I turn it on?
[22:07.72]How do I turn on the... It's done?
[22:10.06]No, dinners must be cooked in the microwave.
[22:16.67]Well, get in there!
[22:24.78]Anybody else, when they cook something in the microwave, when it's done, you're afraid to, like, open it up too quickly?
[22:33.78]Like, two, one, open.
[22:37.16]No, no, no, no, no.
[22:37.84]Don't go near.
[22:38.24]What are you talking about?
[22:38.82]Don't go over there.
[22:40.08]Wait, like, at least 10 seconds for the radioactive air to, like, dissipate, right?
[22:43.40]Like, that freaks me out, doesn't it?
[22:44.39]Do you freak you out?
[22:46.49]How many of you guys at zero open up and grab?
[22:49.03]Like, I feel like there's radioactive activity in there.
[22:55.51]You want some?
[22:56.15]Wait.
[22:56.73]Can we share this?
[22:57.35]Oh, I have a plate now.
[23:07.84]Okay, cool.
[23:08.66]What do I do with the plate?
[23:10.84]You're insane.
[23:12.40]I'm just saying.
[23:13.00]I don't know.
[23:17.55]Oh.
[23:19.41]Swan goose.
[23:20.09]Can I eat dog food?
[23:23.37]Alright, I'm gonna put this in my... I'm gonna put all this stuff in my inventory.
[23:25.15]This is all food and stuff.
[23:28.07]This is, uh... Extra stretchy... I don't know.
[23:31.34]Whatever it is, I'm gonna eat them, whatever they are.
[23:33.00]Fish flakes, just eat them.
[23:34.48]Okay, I got plenty of food now.
[23:42.10]Alright, now I'm gonna go make money.
[23:43.28]I have a ton of all the good... Ooh!
[23:53.51]Can I ride the bike?
[23:56.61]No, I can't ride the bicycle.
[23:57.91]Alright, what have I got?
[24:07.98]My map, okay.
[24:10.98]Somebody needed their lawn mode.
[24:12.19]Somebody needed their lawn mode?
[24:17.01]Make sure you are eating and drinking...
[24:23.87]What the fuck kind of text message?
[24:24.89]Why'd you hit enter that many times, Ma?
[24:26.45]What the fuck are you doing?
[24:28.27]Make sure you're eating and drinking enough, and don't forget to be home before your curfew tonight.
[24:32.01]Hope you win lots of junk and stuff, or whatever the cool kids call it nowadays.
[24:36.15]Please don't make Nanny Bot come looking for you again.
[24:38.35]She's really, she's getting pretty rusty.
[24:43.14]Okay.
[24:43.26]So that means these ones had stuff to do too.
[24:45.12]We're looking for a babysitter.
[24:47.22]We're looking for a babysitter to help us with the little ones.
[24:49.13]It's easy work and we will pay well.
[24:50.79]If you'd like to help us out and earn some extra money, just come to the front door of the house on the map closest to the paper route stand.
[24:56.45]We are also located on the map as a boot icon close to the newspaper stand.
[25:02.62]Boot icon next to the newspaper stand.
[25:06.00]That looks like a boot.
[25:09.54]Oh, that is my vehicle.
[25:12.25]Alright.
[25:12.81]Ride the bike, please.
[25:13.63]I can?
[25:17.79]You can ride the bike.
[25:18.65]How do I get on it?
[25:25.47]I'm wasting too much energy trying to ride the bike.
[25:27.63]It's F?
[25:30.37]Right click.
[25:31.11]What the hell?
[25:31.61]Alright.
[25:33.17]I'm on the bike.
[25:38.12]This is going to make me throw up.
[25:39.32]Can I move the camera back?
[25:42.90]Click the handlebars to mount bike.
[25:44.64]WASD controls the movement and mouse looks around.
[25:46.52]F key and V key will lean back and forth.
[25:47.94]Left shift is bunny hop.
[25:50.46]Where am I going?
[25:52.94]F key and V key lean back.
[25:56.10]Oh, that's okay.
[25:57.40]E will exit the bike.
[25:58.26]All right, I need my map.
[25:59.02]Where am I going?
[26:02.62]V hop.
[26:02.92]All right, I need to do a job.
[26:14.85]Okay, if I hit by a car... Uh... Do a backflip.
[26:22.03]Hold on, I need to... Get off the... I need my map.
[26:25.24]Alright, we need to take a left.
[26:27.02]And then we're gonna go take a left on this road up here.
[26:28.92]I'm gonna go straight.
[26:30.28]Let's go.
[26:36.72]Let's make it fast.
[26:39.57]Don't laugh at car accidents.
[26:41.27]Huh?
[26:41.35]Huh?
[26:44.08]It's too early for you to do that.
[26:45.66]I'm just barely getting started.
[26:47.00]All right.
[26:48.52]Then take a left.
[26:49.18]Where do I take the left?
[26:49.96]Up here?
[26:50.20]Did I pass it already?
[27:00.05]I'm good.
[27:02.01]That looked a lot bigger on the map, though.
[27:03.83]Give me a little bit of credit.
[27:07.25]Okay.
[27:08.19]And then it's down here.
[27:12.35]I feel like I'm going faster than 35.
[27:13.79]All right.
[27:15.99]All right.
[27:22.78]Here's a job.
[27:25.02]I can do a job right here.
[27:26.02]What is this job?
[27:34.89]I got something in my throat.
[27:36.37]I'm going to turn the cam off.
[27:40.37]I had a kale salad earlier.
[27:41.63]And I think I swallowed a little bit of it in my lungs.
[27:45.72]Alright, let's go.
[27:47.40]So, grab.
[27:48.16]Is this like a paper?
[27:53.59]Newspaper delivery.
[27:54.69]You can earn some extra money by delivering papers to the good people of Islandville.
[27:57.53]Just go to the newspaper van located outside by your house.
[28:01.05]Every day, you'll see more stacks of papers being delivered to all the red mailboxes of the island.
[28:06.50]They're marked as red mailboxes on the minimap.
[28:08.94]You get $1.50 per paper plus one rubber band, and if you deliver all the papers to all the boxes, you get a nice bonus.
[28:16.12]Okay.
[28:17.50]Let's go.
[28:17.78]Uh.
[28:26.22]Fuck, I can only... I can only hold that many?
[28:32.55]Why can I only hold that many?
[28:34.75]I can only hold, like, three fucking newspapers?
[28:41.93]Why?
[28:42.11]Why are you guys saying gas?
[28:47.83]Alright, red mailboxes.
[28:48.90]Let's see.
[28:49.22]Is there one over here?
[28:49.74]The mic is delayed.
[28:52.90]It's not.
[28:56.72]Is this a red mailbox?
[28:57.74]Let's see what's on this street.
[29:02.64]Okay.
[29:03.38]This is not a red mailbox.
[29:04.50]I have a red mailbox.
[29:05.60]There's two houses on this street are red mailboxes.
[29:07.37]Let's go.
[29:11.35]It's delayed.
[29:11.81]Inventory's full.
[29:14.57]God!
[29:14.93]Hey, hey!
[29:18.26]Hey!
[29:26.33]Okay.
[29:27.33]This is a... Is this a mailbox?
[29:29.15]Do you need a paper?
[29:29.79]No.
[29:45.27]Mute?
[29:45.67]He's muting.
[29:47.29]Please, there's a delay.
[29:48.17]What the fuck?
[29:49.29]No way.
[29:49.79]There's not a delay.
[29:50.55]There's not a delay.
[29:53.41]I'm taking up 100 million off the debt.
[29:58.98]Not a delay.
[29:59.90]It's not a delay.
[30:00.40]I'm taking a hundred million back.
[30:15.29]Better?
[30:18.94]Hey!
[30:20.20]Better, right?
[30:24.48]There it is.
[30:24.92]Yeah, we're good.
[30:26.62]Now I just look... I'm just darker now.
[30:28.77]I'll fix that.
[30:29.37]Watch this.
[30:29.71]Ready?
[30:30.01]Want to see a trick?
[30:30.75]If you don't... If you need extra light on your face and you're like a streamer or a YouTuber or whatever, get the expensive ring lights and you get lighting all over your... You don't have to do that shit.
[30:39.81]Don't have to do that.
[30:40.52]If you have more than one monitor, or even if you have one and you're recording, just open up MS Paint.
[30:45.16]Fuck that guy.
[30:47.22]Open up MS Paint.
[30:48.92]Have a full white background.
[30:51.02]Just open up a white screen.
[30:53.75]I'll show you.
[31:03.74]And just like that, I've gave myself.
[31:06.28]Hold on.
[31:09.34]Much better lighting.
[31:13.34]Hold on, I can do this better.
[31:14.22]You just need paint.
[31:16.28]You don't need any, like, they sell these lights for like fucking a thousand dollars.
[31:19.87]Hey, you want to see, like, how to save yourself a thousand fucking dollars?
[31:22.57]This is just a white background.
[31:23.71]What's up?
[31:29.73]Put that on your other monitor.
[31:31.23]Make it nice and big like this.
[31:35.97]Let's go.
[31:43.53]Come on.
[31:49.73]Yeah, this is just, I'm just, I'm just opening more white backgrounds.
[31:52.69]Oh, fuck.
[31:54.31]I broke my mic.
[31:54.93]I mean, no, I didn't.
[31:57.99]I'm going to open another white background over here.
[32:11.24]Alright, we're good.
[32:11.64]Only thing, now I can't see if any raids come in.
[32:19.16]Whatever, look, it's perfect.
[32:19.98]You need to buy expensive lighting.
[32:26.03]No, you don't.
[32:27.11]I think there's a bug in my room.
[32:36.45]Still delayed.
[32:37.03]It's not.
[32:40.05]There's no delay.
[32:40.73]There ain't a delay.
[32:41.95]I can see on my screen.
[32:43.41]Ooh, red mailbox.
[32:50.55]If you have a delay, then maybe you have less than a 1080 or something.
[32:56.28]How do I do this?
[32:59.30]Red mailbox.
[33:01.94]How do I deliver the mail?
[33:03.94]Inventory?
[33:15.41]Okay.
[33:17.03]I only have $4.50.
[33:18.35]You're streaming 720p, idiot.
[33:35.22]You know, when I get my new computer, I'm not even gonna tell you guys I got a new computer.
[33:41.40]And we're gonna see if any of you fucking cheeky bastards can tell the difference.
[33:55.97]I bet you you won't be able to tell the difference.
[33:59.41]Get in there!
[34:00.15]What the fuck?
[34:02.39]This job sucks.
[34:04.71]It says it on Twitch.
[34:06.23]Oh, well, whatever.
[34:18.52]Oh my god, that's hard!
[34:21.94]There's a delay, trust me.
[34:23.00]I would like a mod or moderator in the chat right now to speak up here and tell me if there is a delay on my voice or the game.
[34:30.44]I want to see a moderator tell me this.
[34:33.15]A moderator.
[34:33.97]Fuck, I couldn't read it.
[34:40.71]Let me look at the... Hold on.
[34:41.71]Let me look at the mod discord.
[34:53.20]Is there a delay on the stream?
[34:55.26]There is.
[34:57.64]Yes, there is.
[34:58.67]What?
[34:59.29]How?
[34:59.87]Is this even possible?
[35:00.67]It doesn't make any sense.
[35:01.79]What is how?
[35:02.45]It's not possible.
[35:04.79]I don't have any delays.
[35:09.99]What?
[35:11.08]This is insane.
[35:12.24]How much of a delay?
[35:13.10]Look at it.
[35:13.68]Red alert.
[35:14.20]What?
[35:14.44]100 million added.
[35:17.74]No.
[35:18.32]What?
[35:18.64]This doesn't make any sense.
[35:20.64]It's very slight.
[35:23.08]Oh, we've got a new... Let me see.
[35:26.74]Let me see what this looks like.
[35:27.52]Hold on.
[35:29.16]I'm fucking confused as hell.
[35:30.40]I don't see it on my end.
[35:33.86]There ain't a delay.
[35:35.07]I can see on my screen.
[35:38.25]Oh, red mailbox.
[35:42.93]If you have a delay, maybe you have less than a 1080 or so.
[35:59.77]Why is that happening?
[36:08.48]I don't see that on my end.
[36:11.14]Why is it coming through the stream like that?
[36:12.56]What the fuck?
[36:13.14]That didn't make any sense.
[36:29.32]Fix?
[36:29.52]Did I fix it?
[36:31.68]Tell me if I fixed it.
[36:37.38]Is it fixed?
[36:41.94]Hi.
[36:44.78]Wait, do I just talk weird?
[36:45.98]Do sounds come out of my mouth before my mouth starts moving?
[36:49.88]I think that's happening.
[36:50.88]Is that how I talk?
[36:52.35]Wait, hold on.
[36:57.47]Hi.
[36:59.38]Hi.
[37:00.20]Sounds are coming up before my mouth opens.
[37:02.56]What's up?
[37:04.58]What's happening?
[37:05.64]Sounds are coming up before my mouth is closed.
[37:07.18]Before my mouth is done closing.
[37:12.70]I'm finishing the sentence before my mouth closes.
[37:15.04]I talk weird.
[37:16.44]I said weird and my mouth closed after the D. That was really weird.
[37:22.68]I think I just talk weird.
[37:25.58]Snap your fingers.
[37:34.43]That was delayed?
[37:36.09]That was... but that... You guys are freaking me out.
[37:42.28]I think he's insane.
[37:46.66]Your voice is too fast for your mouth.
[37:52.16]Video is delayed.
[37:53.08]All right, hold on.
[37:54.04]How about this one?
[37:54.54]Ready?
[37:55.36]What if I do this?
[38:00.03]How's that?
[38:00.29]Does that change anything?
[38:04.69]It's up.
[38:06.65]I made it worse.
[38:07.36]I can't fix it.
[38:08.24]It must be the shitty webcam.
[38:13.56]It's the shitty webcam, guys.
[38:21.62]Turn it off.
[38:22.91]See, this is what happens when I turn on facecam.
[38:24.67]You guys all have something to fucking complain about now.
[38:31.03]Wait, what if I do this?
[38:31.61]Hold on.
[38:31.85]Ready?
[38:32.01]Wait.
[38:32.19]Hold on.
[38:33.85]I don't want to give you the... Ready?

[38:42.06]No, I need that.
[38:42.66]I'm going to die of starvation out here.

[39:46.37]I already delivered to this one.
[39:48.69]I have $6.50.
[39:52.71]I wish I could look at the map while riding the bike.
[39:54.85]Okay, taking a left down here and then a left again.
[40:02.01]There's a bunch on that street.
[40:04.67]This is a different game mode.
[40:05.75]This is survival mode.
[40:09.31]You have to make money before you can play the arcade games.
[40:11.48]There's a person on the street, dude.
[40:13.30]What the fuck?
[40:21.58]Alright, there should be a red mailbox right here.
[40:27.76]I knew they were coming too!
[40:37.06]I do have a lot of bullshit in my inventory though, don't I?
[40:38.88]Uh, eat the food?
[40:43.72]I'm gonna drink the drink.
[40:44.34]Alright, let's go.
[40:54.23]Get it in there.
[40:54.63]Am I doing this wrong?
[41:09.10]I have to be doing this wrong.
[41:09.92]There has to be a way I can move this, right?
[41:11.46]I am.
[41:11.88]How do I do it then?
[41:16.20]Throw it in.
[41:16.62]He zonked.
[41:36.54]I think I am doing it right.
[41:37.54]Can I tilt it around?
[41:38.68]I don't think I can even tilt it.
[41:39.96]Are there like bugs flying around?
[41:44.10]What?
[41:45.54]Just put it in.
[41:46.12]Jesus Christ.
[42:04.78]Put it on the side.
[42:14.82]Oh my god!
[42:15.94]Your mailbox sucks!
[42:26.03]For a second, I don't know why, I thought the bike had gas.
[42:28.71]Alright, looking for another.
[42:33.82]For sale, how much?
[42:37.24]Is it less than $8?
[42:37.82]Probably not.
[42:49.89]The smallest thing, the smallest object in the game, the skinniest object in the game I ran right into.
[42:55.19]Try this again.
[43:22.25]Oh, why am I doing this so wrong?
[43:24.17]You got a link?
[43:27.09]Hold on.
[43:36.35]Link, link, link.
[43:37.07]All right, all right, all right, all right.
[43:38.09]Just relax.
[43:41.57]Yeah, I have a scared face and I have a big fucking gross like rubber mask neck.
[43:45.90]I know, I understand.
[44:05.39]Why is this so difficult to get this done?
[44:07.05]I have to be doing this wrong.
[44:15.45]Pick it up by the band?
[44:36.55]Go slower.
[44:43.17]That made me so angry.
[44:44.55]I got unreasonably angry.
[44:46.39]That's why the face cam I don't like having on.
[44:47.93]That beep was like... That got me like... That got me fucking angry.
[44:58.50]Oh my god.
[45:22.20]I only have 20... What's my curfew?
[45:26.06]What time is it right now?
[45:26.76]It's 2pm?
[45:27.34]Alright, I got time, I think.
[45:28.16]Alright, this is the last one, then I'm gonna go play some games.
[45:35.99]Because I don't... Like, this is a pain in the ass.
[45:42.69]2x4 camera, Andy.
[45:46.75]No, I don't care about webcam.
[45:54.57]There it is.
[45:56.23]Alright, I got $12.50.
[45:58.41]I'm gonna go back to the house and then... I'm gonna have a TV dinner and I'm gonna go play some games.
[46:08.42]There's an iPhone camera.
[46:09.52]I don't... I don't... What do you need to look at me for?
[46:12.83]You don't need to see... Why do you need to see my face?
[46:14.37]You know what I look like?
[46:15.79]Alright, so I need to go right and then to home.
[46:28.83]Is this an arcade simulator?
[46:30.07]This is an arcade game simulator, but I'm in survival mode right now.
[46:34.80]Which I have to make money.
[46:36.80]I think I just lost an elbow.
[46:38.72]I have to make money.
[46:39.70]We're going to heat up a TV dinner.
[46:58.27]Bike is in the garage.
[46:59.00]Good.
[46:59.32]Alright.
[47:00.40]Wait, can I sell this stuff?
[47:01.50]Can I sell my, like, possessions?
[47:08.48]Alright, let's go inside.
[47:09.54]Say hello.
[47:10.84]What's the, um... What's the curfew?
[47:22.55]Sell you a bike for the money.
[47:23.73]I don't know.

[69:16.90]One little patch right here.
[69:18.08]Come on, give me $100 for this.
[69:18.95]How much does it cost to have a lawn mowed?

[69:45.87]Oh.
[69:45.93]How much do you think the issue cost?
[70:09.42]I guess it's based on how big the lawn is, right?
[70:11.60]If you got a huge lawn, I would say how many square footage the lawn is.
[70:17.48]There's like still one little sliver of grass.
[70:19.90]I mean, you got depends on the size, right?
[70:28.25]I mean, if you have a if you have a lawn that's as if you have a yard or lawn that's this big, just like this.

[75:36.29]It's up the stairs?
[75:46.34]Get in bed.
[75:46.80]Get in bed.
[75:47.16]Get in bed.
[75:47.56]Get in bed.
[75:52.10]He's cooking himself.
[76:03.85]All right.
[76:04.11]We made it through the first day.
[76:09.04]I get it now.
[76:09.60]I understand how the game is played.
[76:10.52]I do want to get one of these, though.
[76:16.25]Because I can probably sell this stuff.
[76:23.96]I can definitely sell this at the pawn shop.
[76:32.05]Open the door.
[76:32.71]Just open the door.
[76:34.83]What do you mean just open the door?
[76:52.97]I mean I guess
[77:22.47]Fucking give me a break.
[77:26.11]Oh, I have toilet water!
[77:27.35]My favorite!
[77:37.27]Alright, I have full energy.
[77:42.23]Give me a bunch of these.
[77:44.98]What do I have in my inventory?
[77:47.60]I'm gonna sell this shit.
[77:48.48]Alright, what do I even do with this stuff?
[77:49.86]First aid?
[77:51.48]Fish flakes.
[77:52.72]Gary's food.
[77:53.84]Okay, Gary's food.
[78:03.56]Gary's food must be prepared.
[78:05.36]His name is Gary.
[78:08.16]On his dinner mat.
[78:12.30]Okay.
[78:14.08]And Gary?
[78:14.66]What happens if we don't feed Gary?
[78:18.85]Close the fridge.
[78:24.47]No.
[78:25.20]Fine.
[78:29.02]No.
[78:30.46]I was about to say, why are you guys freaking out so much?
[78:32.90]This doesn't cost any electricity.
[78:34.64]Like, I'm not, this is just like a fake thing.
[78:37.44]That's incorrect.
[78:38.84]Because what has to happen when I open this is my graphics card needs to render the stuff going on, the particle effects and the pixels going on in here.
[78:48.19]Therefore, using extra electrical consumption for my graphics card, therefore adding bills, adding money to my electric bill.
[78:58.13]Interesting.
[79:05.36]Actually, no, that is actually true.
[79:06.76]I know.
[79:08.94]I need, uh, let's feed the fish.
[79:20.79]Fish flakes.
[79:25.55]Oops, sorry.
[79:29.99]It's just a little wet.
[79:30.87]It's okay.
[79:33.77]Oh my god, it's a frenzy!
[79:34.91]Okay, we're good?
[79:43.69]Junk?
[79:44.57]Coffee?
[79:46.75]I'm out if I do.
[79:51.99]Your shadow is creepy.
[79:53.01]Okay, I've got pretty much full health, full energy.
[79:58.38]I'm ready to go.
[80:01.49]Mow the guy's lawn again.
[80:02.61]I don't know.
[80:11.85]Will it be not?
[80:12.49]Maybe it'll be almost completed.
[80:15.27]Okay, where the hell does this guy live?
[80:24.33]Right here.
[80:25.15]So I gotta go out, left, and straight over here.
[80:27.81]Wait, was it this one?
[80:28.59]Was it this one or this one?
[80:33.75]It was this one, right?
[80:35.67]The one above?
[80:36.23]Yeah, it was that one.
[80:37.47]So we gotta go out, left, right, up.
[80:39.96]Got it.
[80:40.18]We got lottery tickets at the gas station.
[80:47.36]I have 50 cents, dude.
[80:50.90]I have 50 cents.
[80:52.98]I cannot afford to go buy a lottery ticket right now.
[80:59.66]I need to have a bank account worth at least $100 to $200.
[81:01.54]So I can go play at the Pirate's Village, whatever it's called.
[81:05.86]I tried to jump this fucking thing.
[81:17.78]Don't play survival?
[81:18.70]Switch the game mode, please.
[81:20.38]Actually, I'm having like fun.
[81:22.12]This is like stupid, but it's cool.
[81:29.91]Hello, dog.
[81:33.15]Is it mowed?
[81:37.65]I think it's mowed.
[81:40.05]No, it is.
[81:40.59]All right.
[81:40.89]No, it kept it.
[81:45.02]Did it keep all the mowing?
[81:47.74]I think so.
[81:51.54]Shadow is terrifying.
[81:53.14]Whatever.
[81:54.36]It did.
[81:54.66]Thank God.
[81:55.32]All right.
[81:55.54]Let's get some money here.
[82:08.84]Going over the concrete like... I'm just like shaving it down.
[82:14.92]I'm like sanding the concrete.
[82:16.19]Alright, here we go.
[82:25.17]Now I can actually see what the hell I'm doing.
[82:31.12]I like this.
[82:36.30]Wait, what would happen?
[82:37.84]If I were to go like this, would the, would the blade like hit the concrete and go like, boom, and like shoot like 3,000 feet in the air?
[82:49.82]Or would it be like, What the, that's fucking, I had lawnmowers get the shit out of me.
[83:03.46]Lawnmowers scare the shit out of me.
[83:06.98]I'm sorry.
[83:07.82]You can call me weirdo.
[83:08.80]Like I told you, like, I don't like ovens.
[83:10.06]A box that heats up to 500 degrees that sits in your wall.
[83:13.24]There's enclosed in the wall.
[83:14.58]I don't like that.
[83:15.38]Gas goes in there and shit.
[83:16.59]I don't like it.
[83:17.01]I don't know why.
[83:18.93]A lawnmower that loud and right, like, two and a half feet in front of me is a spinning blade that can chop your bones in half.
[83:27.93]I don't know.
[83:28.41]What if it, like, comes loose and fires out like a fucking Mega Man weapon?
[83:32.27]I don't know.
[83:34.41]I just get the shit out of me.
[83:35.61]I don't like it.
[83:44.08]Get a riding mower.
[83:45.48]Yeah, but I know, but still.
[83:46.66]It's caveman logic.
[83:49.26]It doesn't matter.
[83:50.18]Look, irrational fears are called irrational fears because they are irrational.
[83:56.13]I know that's not going to happen.
[83:58.39]And now you can't even hear me.
[83:59.71]You can't even hear me talking.
[84:05.75]There.
[84:05.93]All right, how we doing?
[84:14.79]God, I can't wait to go to a pirate school.
[84:18.98]What if that place is called?
[84:22.04]He missed a spot in the alley.
[84:24.28]Let me get over here first.
[84:32.34]It's five nights at Freddy's or whatever.

[89:50.38]That's it?
[90:01.19]Oh, he's in the chest, right?
[90:02.83]Is one more?
[90:08.27]Where is it?

[90:30.10]Alright, we're good.

[91:09.91]Alright, what is making the smashing sound?
[91:12.91]What are you guys doing in here?
[91:23.11]Oh, okay.
[91:24.15]Okay, we'll see.
[91:27.33]Oh, if their arm stays up, they're asleep.
[91:30.43]I go over and I lift up their arm and they hold it there thinking that they're making their parents look stupid.
[91:37.04]Ever tell you that story?
[91:40.57]I told you that, right?
[91:43.64]When I was younger, I shared a bedroom with my brother.
[91:47.83]And we would just be messing around and talking.
[91:50.49]We would not be going to sleep at night, right?
[91:53.23]You take 10 kids to go to bed.
[91:55.41]So my parents would come in and hear us talking.
[91:58.45]We weren't sleeping.
[91:59.15]We were being bad.
[92:00.39]And we would go, oh, shit.
[92:03.09]like pretend to be asleep so they would come into the room and they would go oh looks like they're asleep in here oh well of course they are f must have heard something it could not have been what they were doing well you know the best way to tell is uh you know if their arm stays up they're asleep and they would grab one of our arms and like hold it and we thought we were being so smart we were like just playing the system so much you would sit there and go like this
[92:32.04]And they'd go, oh, he's asleep, he's asleep, all right.
[92:35.55]And they'd put it back down and...
[92:38.29]Okay, yeah, they they're asleep and then they would leave So over time in the few years would go by we got keen to this trick So we would do the most unbelievable like theater like flopping when they would come in and do this again So again sleep.
[92:55.20]Oh shit.
[92:55.48]Okay, they're gonna do that thing.
[92:56.60]Well, I'm gonna trick them this time They'll know I'm asleep because I know that holding your arm up means you're awake So yeah, you do this like like soccer like flop, right?
[93:06.96]Oh, if his arm stays up, he's asleep, and it would just be like... Oh, he's definitely asleep now.
[93:14.71]Let's try that again.
[93:15.57]He's like, now we got him.
[93:24.38]It's fine.
[93:27.72]Anyways, if their arm stays up, they're asleep.
[93:32.90]You're a mom.
[93:34.63]Outplayed.
[93:40.56]You guys go to bed.
[93:44.14]Arms up, guys.
[93:46.44]That's a fun little thing, right?
[93:51.55]If I ever have kids one day, for any reason, I cannot wait to do the if their arm stays up, they're asleep thing.
[94:06.89]Please, God, no.
[94:07.88]Don't ever have them.
[94:13.28]yeah all right yeah why not why why not why look I I know that there's this misconception that you guys don't think I could even like tie my shoes and I can't but that's besides the point it's hard to do knots are difficult especially when you do the bunny ears and you try to do it cleanly it happens a lot it's hard to do that but that doesn't mean that I cannot take care of somebody else
[94:42.37]Buy your shoes right now.
[94:43.31]I don't have shoes on.
[94:47.05]I don't just have like a pair of sneakers on all day.

[102:20.44]Oh, it's $3.
[102:21.10]Um, what about... I need... What about the Kid Cuisine?
[102:50.21]What would you do for like a crumpled up Mountain Dew can?
[102:52.95]50 cents, that's not bad.
[102:58.27]I have 74 dollars.
[102:59.51]On a microwave meal.
[103:16.62]Somebody's in there with, like, a silver ring in front of you.
[103:21.50]And then you're just sitting there.
[103:23.34]Behind you, somebody has, like, an antique clock.
[103:25.82]You're sitting there with, like, two or three freezer meals.
[103:29.42]What can I get for these?
[103:31.18]Well, I guess if they were rare.
[103:32.22]What if they were, like, from the... Okay, what if they were preserved?
[103:35.50]Frozen since, like, 1992 or something.
[103:36.96]An old kid cuisine.
[103:37.66]How much is an old kid cuisine from 1993 worth today?
[103:41.56]Can we look it up?
[103:49.48]Somebody probably collects the boxes.
[103:50.66]Zero.
[103:52.10]I don't think so.
[103:52.88]PSA 10, Kid Cuisine.
[103:53.36]Alright, I got $74.
[103:54.23]I'm going back to the... I'm going back to play the games.
[104:14.74]Is it worth 35 bucks?
[104:15.92]That's still probably... That's like a... Probably a thousand percent return.
[104:20.30]What were they?
[104:20.64]Like two or three dollars back in the 90s?
[104:23.46]If it was like a hundred bucks?
[104:27.20]It's cops.
[104:27.66]All right.
[104:32.39]I'm gonna go and I'm gonna play video games now because I have energy drinks.
[104:37.73]I have kid cuisines.
[104:39.49]I have money.
[104:40.05]I got 75 bucks.
[104:41.11]I'm going back to that place.
[104:43.63]Wherever the heck it is.
[104:46.91]We are going to go back this way.
[104:50.43]There's a lot of community subs.
[104:51.76]It's 25 community subs from Soda Cat.
[104:54.18]Thanks for the soda.
[104:56.46]I don't know.
[104:57.56]I'm getting older and I don't think words just go in and come out.
[104:59.92]I don't know what that, I don't know.
[105:01.40]Thanks for the 25 subs though.
[105:03.80]All right, we're going to go all the way back here.
[105:06.24]So we're going to turn around and go behind us.
[105:08.99]So we're going to turn around and go right, right.
[105:14.11]We're going to go that way.
[105:22.27]What?
[105:30.96]Sing the soda song.
[105:32.18]Sure.
[106:00.00]All right, am I gonna go right?
[106:00.92]This way, and then up the dirt road.
[106:08.15]This is close to the house.
[106:11.63]Those lyrics sucked.
[106:13.55]I'm not, I don't write lyrics.
[106:15.21]I'm more of a, I'm just an ideas guy.
[106:18.54]Imagine being a songwriter, but being an ideas guy.
[106:25.26]and sitting in like a meeting going man you know I would love like a song that was like something like that would be perfect and it's gonna have a big finish like at the end you think you can work with that it's like bring your kid to work day
[106:58.14]I think that this should be a song with a drum beat and a big horn in the middle.
[107:04.90]And, um, this should be a guitar riff that goes ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[107:14.77]I don't know what you can make the song about, but I mean, I'm going to give you that idea.
[107:18.17]And that idea is not cheap.
[107:19.49]I'm about to go into the ocean.
[107:20.59]I'm okay.
[107:32.86]Let's go.

[122:02.05]I can understand.
[122:08.55]You're annoying.

[132:33.46]Pop sounds so much cooler.
[132:36.54]Pop.
[132:37.72]That sounds better.
[132:38.68]But it's a soda for me.
[132:43.99]I still am like dying.

[133:34.25]Give me the avocado.
[133:34.85]I want it.
[133:35.15]Those are a hot item.
[133:42.74]I'm selling this tomorrow.
[133:44.60]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[133:45.30]You have to go to bed.
[133:47.56]Run.
[133:47.76]You're right.

[134:16.92]Why am I still holding tickets?
[134:23.72]Home is left.
[134:25.77]Just go left.
[134:26.57]You don't have any time?
[134:31.65]That was a pretty cool trick, I tell you.
[134:36.89]I just made all these people just shit their pants.
[134:42.95]So go this way, right up there.
[134:44.25]There's my house.
[134:44.71]Don't get hit by a car!
[134:47.19]Am I riding on the median?
[134:58.55]You're just riding a bike across an intersection.
[135:02.13]You don't even look both ways.
[135:03.17]You're just going like 20 miles per hour and you just go, don't get hit by a car!
[135:07.70]While you pedal across.
[135:10.20]Where am I going?
[135:19.69]Where's my fucking house?
[135:26.38]Where's my house?
[135:27.06]I don't know.
[135:27.52]I don't know where the house is.
[135:28.44]Where's my house?
[135:30.94]It's like down, but it's like over behind me.
[135:32.77]I can't even.
[135:41.53]Where's my house?
[135:49.57]Why does this feel so wrong?
[135:51.37]What the fuck am I going?
[135:52.83]It's behind me?
[135:53.55]Come on, pedal up.
[136:07.78]Pedal up.
[136:14.83]I can't get off the bike.
[136:22.83]Hurry!
[136:23.21]I'm good.
[136:38.97]Okay, I'm good.
[136:41.03]Bedtime.
[136:44.69]Okay, I guess I'm going to bed.
[136:46.13]Right now.
[136:56.49]Something is not right here.
[136:57.63]I have negative one hour.
[136:59.68]Okay.
[137:06.34]Speedrun strat?
[137:09.48]Kind of.
[137:09.82]You want to know the worst part about this whole like stupid fucking drink the heal joke?
[137:29.28]I don't have a sponsorship with Huel.
[137:31.40]I never probably will.
[137:33.84]I don't know why I keep doing this.
[137:35.14]I don't know why that makes me laugh.
[137:37.33]But that's... I'm just doing it for free.
[137:43.13]I don't know why I think that's funny, but it kind of is.
[137:50.90]Get sponsored.
[137:53.58]Give in.
[137:57.47]Okay, so I just like drink these sometimes.
[138:00.47]So what?
[138:01.29]Because like I'm a streamer and I consume a product sometimes.
[138:06.10]All of a sudden, it's just automatically now I have to be sponsored by that product.
[138:10.74]Is this what we do?
[138:13.36]You know, I kind of like to drink this drink.
[138:17.62]I better get paid to drink it now.
[138:24.35]How do I go about doing that, by the way?
[138:27.49]Excuse me, Dr. Huel.
[138:29.59]Yeah, it's me, German995.
[138:31.33]You know, I really like drinking those delicious Huel's.
[138:35.11]Pay me money now to drink it.
[138:37.63]I'll take it.
[138:39.45]What?
[138:41.11]Just ask.
[138:47.17]Hey, can I have some money?
[138:50.47]I've showed that on stream once.
[138:56.32]If I consume anything in front of a camera, I deserve to be paid for it.
[139:06.96]Ah.
[139:11.42]Harold J. Huell.
[139:16.94]But really, though, I'm available for any type of contractual shit if you want to talk about it.
[139:20.87]I'm available for anything like that.
[139:23.86]tell you one thing I ain't tweeting I ain't gonna do a whole stream dedicate I'll drink it on stream why am I like giving an ad for myself like I'm pitching this to no one I'm pitching it to the to the wall you simply adopted the brand
[139:53.04]We are the wall.
[140:00.06]16,000 people here.
[140:00.96]One of them could be Huel.
[140:06.88]You know what?
[140:07.96]I like him.
[140:09.24]I think it's pretty good.
[140:11.55]But whatever.
[140:12.41]I don't have to be paid to say that.
[140:15.52]If I was, though, I mean, maybe that would be... No, no, fuck that.
[140:19.84]I'd never taken a sponsorship in my whole life.
[140:21.94]I've never taken one.
[140:24.56]I will take one small check of like six to seven figures.
[140:31.16]For me to have a stream about it, though.
[140:32.84]And that's my pitch to you.
[140:34.28]I'm not tweeting about it.
[140:35.54]I'm not going to talk about it.
[140:36.40]I'm going to drink it on stream and I'm going to wink at the camera.
[140:38.72]If that's worth six to seven figures to you, you got my email.
[140:42.10]Except you probably don't because I don't even respond to my email.
[140:44.96]I have not checked my business email in like six fucking years.
[140:48.62]I don't have open DMs.
[140:50.92]And it's impossible to contact me.
[140:52.98]So...
[140:55.84]I guess let's just call this meeting at it's not happening.
[140:58.86]Not happening.
[140:59.40]Okay.
[141:00.42]Thank you for your time.
[141:01.13]I appreciate it.
[141:12.99]Business email stream.
[141:14.61]No, we are not doing that.
[141:17.57]I made one like eight years ago thinking it was like maybe I should give this to people and I didn't even use it.
[141:27.52]It's funny because I have like this old business email.
[141:30.63]Somebody probably has tried to send me something or contact me.
[141:36.19]I haven't even opened it.
[141:40.70]Somebody could have given me coordinates to a briefcase full of like a million dollars in cash to that like business email.
[141:46.54]And I don't know.
[141:47.46]I've never opened it.
[141:51.47]Where's my bike?
[141:57.42]Holy shit, that is a scary, uh... That is a really scary image.
[142:01.58]Alright, where's the bike?
[142:11.45]Shitload more subs?
[142:12.59]Oh my god, they did come in.
[142:16.29]10, 10, 10, 5, 5, 5.

[142:22.64]Sodacat, another 5.
[142:23.98]Tidy Raleigh, thanks for the 5.
[142:25.56]And then, yeah.
[142:28.60]And then Matt, Matt Troy, yes, thanks for the 10.
[142:30.92]All right, my bike's over here.
[142:40.85]Where's the bike?
[142:41.35]Come on, where's my bike?
[142:46.13]Thanks, Matt.
[142:47.93]Hey, thank you, Matt.
[142:52.10]Where's the bike?
[142:55.70]It says it's right here.
[142:57.75]I don't see a bike.
[143:05.65]You see a bike?
[143:08.95]Ah!
[143:09.65]Alright, we're selling that shit.
[143:13.71]It's up your ass.
[143:14.77]Ha ha ha ha.
[143:18.37]Don't time that person up.
[143:22.01]Don't time that person up.
[143:33.85]Much as I know we should.
[143:36.85]Much as I want to.
[143:48.60]It's the ha ha ha at the end.
[143:50.39]Okay, where's the, uh, pawn shop?
[144:01.26]We gotta go straight down here, straight, and then left.
[144:20.77]Thanks for the ride.
[144:22.43]This is where I had to go.
[144:24.07]Why did he tail swipe me?
[144:25.39]What the fuck was that?
[144:26.58]What the hell are these people doing?
[144:30.01]He just, like, tail hit me.
[144:31.51]He was trying to kill me.
[144:35.43]What a... Owned.

[145:12.25]Salt rock.

[145:24.59]Holy shit, that was fucking crazy.

[147:14.73]I have to kill this guy.
[147:17.03]Right?
[147:17.23]I have to kill this guy.
[147:19.27]This guy has to be killed.
[147:20.05]Trade for it.
[147:48.15]Put him in the pond with the bat.
[147:49.87]I don't think I can do that.
[147:50.67]I need someone to come down this road.
[147:53.17]Here we go.
[148:09.97]Can we like GTA this where you have a pedestrian like accidentally punch or kick somebody else or another car and they all freak out and start beating the shit out of each other?
[148:28.71]He can't die.
[148:33.97]Can I drown him?
[148:37.21]I'm going to try.
[148:37.95]Can I drown him?
[148:48.27]Put him in the machine.
[148:49.05]I can't.
[148:51.47]I need this wooden bat, but I can't talk to this guy.
[148:54.57]Put him in the grape crusher.
[149:02.30]Shoot him.
[149:12.17]Tell the bot I can't bring him inside.
[149:22.31]Put him in a red mailbox.
[149:24.95]Hold on.
[149:38.29]He's very bad at swinging this at me, though.
[149:45.75]Press F. Yeah, I can't.
[149:46.89]It says that's not mine.
[149:52.30]What the fuck's over there?
[149:53.60]That's like a weird shack over there.
[149:54.84]We're gonna investigate that after this.
[150:11.43]This is fucking crazy.
[150:12.75]I... I'm trying to kill this guy.
[150:50.02]Drop the bat?
[151:02.20]No.
[151:10.62]He went even higher.
[151:11.46]He went even higher.
[151:21.02]How high can he go?
[151:21.78]What, am I missing him?
[151:31.89]I kind of want to get a firework and shoot it up there.
[151:53.96]Slowly bringing it back down to earth.
[151:55.90]Whatever, just leave him.
[151:56.52]Who cares?
[151:56.84]I want to go and see what that shack is over there.
[152:10.94]See what I'm talking about?
[152:11.64]See down there?
[152:12.06]There's like a weird shack.
[152:18.31]Let him starve.
[152:20.97]Oh, you weren't saying, let him starve.
[152:22.65]You went, you let him starve in a sad face.
[152:25.65]Oh, okay.
[152:26.31]Well, that's why texting is hard to do.
[152:29.32]It's hard to read what people are talking about when they're texting.
[152:33.14]I don't like texting.
[152:33.84]I like to talk to you.
[152:42.10]That hurt me.
[152:46.87]It's a boomer.
[152:47.51]It's not a boomer thing.
[152:48.51]Do you understand?
[152:50.18]Okay, when I talk to somebody, if I'm speaking to them like this, right?
[152:54.84]I can just talk and we can have a conversation.
[152:57.51]But you know how hard it is to actually make decent conversation with just talking like typing?
[153:03.17]I found it hard to do.
[153:04.81]Because you'll type something, and then you'll go, no, no, no, delete, delete, delete.
[153:08.95]What did I say?
[153:09.51]I don't know.
[153:10.31]Are they going to get that?
[153:12.17]Let me try something else.
[153:14.02]Write another sentence.
[153:15.30]I guess that's okay, me saying that, I guess.
[153:18.96]Where direct communication like this, we get it.
[153:22.02]We know exactly what's going on here.
[153:23.29]It's almost like you have to craft perfect sentences when you talk to people on the internet through a text box.
[153:33.45]Unless, of course, you're here.
[153:35.39]And you're, like, telling me to, like, shove a bike up my ass.
[153:38.19]I mean, you definitely didn't think too much about writing that, but you did.
[153:43.79]But I don't know who you are, right?
[153:46.95]if you and I were in a discord dm together and we're hanging out I'm not sure you would tell me to shove a bike up my ass I'm pretty sure that you'd probably think you'd be like should I write that to him right now should I write this that's probably I don't know he's gonna understand like like lol like what what the are you talking about there is a house back here how many food
[154:27.13]I'm talking about non-anonymous texting.
[154:30.40]Like, talking.
[154:42.57]Pick up your trash.
[154:43.39]What?
[154:43.89]Evil.
[154:44.17]What?
[154:47.97]What is over here?
[154:49.03]There's probably going to be a secret item in here.
[155:00.01]It's an invisible wall.
[155:06.69]Great.
[155:08.41]Why is that there?
[155:18.92]God damn it.
[155:23.26]Just fly like the other guy.
[155:24.54]Oh, the UFO arcade.
[155:28.82]I got four bucks.
[155:29.36]Let's go.
[155:36.67]Do a noclip.
[155:45.35]Why can't I drive one of those?
[155:46.29]Get the scratch cards at the gas station.
[155:57.10]Oh, I forgot about these ones.
[155:58.02]These ones are fun.
[155:59.44]Oh, these ones are really fun.
[156:00.92]I love this place.
[156:01.64]Ski ball.
[156:13.10]Oh, is that not powerful enough?
[156:19.96]Oh, the dizzy bird.
[156:20.88]Alright, alright, I will.
[156:21.74]I only have three dollars.
[156:27.08]Alright, survival mode is fun, but I want to play the games and make money and make tickets and stuff.
[156:42.84]You're in a coma, wake up.
[156:52.37]I'm never gonna get 100.
[156:58.40]I'll never get 100, whatever.
[157:01.92]Can I get tickets?
[157:05.60]No, no tickets?
[157:06.74]Oh, there's another ball.
[157:12.10]Hold the plug.
[157:17.40]I really hope you hear this.
[157:21.10]Please wake up.
[157:21.78]150 fucking tickets I just got for what?
[157:24.32]I didn't do anything.
[157:29.14]Oh my goodness.
[157:30.78]Get away from me.
[157:31.82]Leave me alone.
[157:34.04]What are you doing to me?
[157:38.08]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[157:38.92]I don't want to do it.
[157:39.54]I thought the card was still... Whatever.
[157:40.74]That's free tickets.
[157:56.49]Don't wake up.
[157:57.09]Do something funny.
[158:06.30]You go into the room with like... I'm like in the coma.
[158:12.41]And a handful of you just sitting around the bed.
[158:15.15]Don't wake up.
[158:17.69]And one of you leans into my and goes, do something funny.
[158:22.80]I don't, I don't think I'm, I don't think it's going to work.
[158:27.66]Do something funny to like the guy that's like.
[158:39.03]and then you fart wait like me lying down and like I fart and I like go what are you talking about that's a family guy joke you know I'm sure it is
[159:07.44]Okay.
[159:08.76]I have my... Let's go.
[159:13.48]Oh, okay.
[159:14.14]I'm... I wanted to do the thing where I get all the free money.
[159:18.48]Where's Dizzy Bird?
[159:25.27]Where's Dizzy Bird?
[159:25.83]I don't think it's in this one.
[159:34.87]I think Dizzy Bird's in the other arcade.
[159:38.74]Is it upstairs?
[159:46.40]No, it's not up here.
[159:47.80]It's in the other arcade.
[159:49.86]They patched it out.
[159:55.82]Oh my god, that was on camera.
[160:17.42]I was on camera.
[160:29.45]You were out of frame?
[160:30.15]Thank God.
[160:30.59]Alright, I'm going to turn in these tickets.
[160:39.37]2,000 tickets.
[160:40.35]You got yourself 20 tickets.
[160:43.28]Wait, give me that back.
[160:52.63]404.
[160:52.75]Damn it.
[161:02.64]Dang it.
[161:03.16]Dang it.
[161:03.70]Dang it.
[161:04.02]Wait.
[161:04.98]Isn't one of these, uh, worth a lot of money?
[161:11.62]Minus two.
[161:12.26]Do funny joke.
[161:13.10]No funny joke.
[161:13.76]Do funny joke.
[161:14.40]Funny man.
[161:19.56]I can't even buy any sour treats.
[161:25.45]Alright, I want to go and... I want to play arcade games now.
[161:30.27]It's too much.
[161:30.79]It's hard.
[161:31.15]I don't have any money.
[161:34.32]I don't have any money.
[161:35.28]Tear your teeth, please.
[161:40.44]I don't fucking have any.
[161:41.32]I can't even take the bus.
[162:00.96]Shit, I can't even take the bus.
[162:02.10]How am I going to get back to my house?
[162:05.84]Oh, vehicle reset.
[162:08.40]Your bike has been towed to your home garage.
[162:10.14]Oh, shit.
[162:17.30]Raid's coming in?
[162:19.75]Who's raiding?
[162:20.29]Raid?
[162:29.68]All right, we're waiting for a raid.
[162:32.45]Oh my goodness.
[162:39.01]Raid?
[162:41.95]Is a raid coming in?
[162:51.32]Are you guys serious?
[162:52.36]A raid?
[162:54.60]No way.
[162:58.55]I'm about to die.
[162:59.31]I'm dead.
[162:59.73]I'm about to die.
[163:00.87]I can die in this game?
[163:10.13]I'm dead.
[163:13.38]I can't eat it.
[163:14.48]The shit's frozen.
[163:15.30]I can't eat it.
[163:17.02]I'm dead.
[163:18.46]How do you... Wait.
[163:19.24]Just go into the fucking beam.
[163:35.13]Melted in the beam.
[163:35.77]Oh, Andy.
[163:35.93]Reporter Andy.
[163:36.25]Oh, shit.
[163:36.41]This is funny.
[163:59.26]Well that's survival mode, that's fun.
[164:28.68]Actual real tragedy.
[164:30.02]Am I?
[164:33.86]How am I?
[164:34.14]Why am I not seeing raids?
[164:35.54]Did somebody raid already?
[164:37.04]Did we get a raid?
[164:38.48]I can't.
[164:39.02]Why isn't it popping up for me?
[164:43.92]They're here now?
[164:44.59]Am I getting baited?
[164:47.95]Did we get raided?
[164:52.23]We lied.
[164:53.01]Chat's lying.
[164:53.67]Oh.
[164:54.33]Oh.
[164:57.33]Oh, it's fake.
[164:57.89]Okay.
[164:59.19]Cool.
[164:59.59]All right.
[165:02.17]I want to just go play the games in there.
[165:03.41]Heart day mode.
[165:10.76]Attack of the one guys.
[165:12.06]Really?
[165:16.47]Sing the red song anyways.
[165:30.29]It's still saved here.
[165:31.03]Alright, I want to go.
[165:37.77]I want to go to the new arcade.
[165:39.37]I want to play the new games.
[165:41.75]That's all I want.
[165:44.29]We're going straight up here.
[165:45.61]Just go up.
[165:52.14]Give me this.
[166:09.47]Spit just went everywhere.
[166:13.14]Oh, I'm sorry.
[166:19.90]You guys got it wrong.
[166:20.56]That is the... Excuse me.
[166:23.08]Quiet.
[166:24.59]That noise is the Wendy's Frosty machine.
[166:29.59]The stick that comes down and it goes... Fucking relax.
[166:50.51]Holy shit!
[167:07.04]McTwist?
[167:16.74]Like, make him famous.
[167:18.44]Make me famous.
[167:26.36]Aw, that's beautiful.
[167:49.99]It actually was though.
[167:51.39]It was actually really good.
[167:52.45]It was cool.
[167:53.91]It was actually beautiful.
[167:55.73]I'm here.
[168:00.56]I thought that was the car making that noise.
[168:12.27]Okay.
[168:16.13]I got money, but going here immediately.
[168:21.00]Okay.
[168:22.42]In 10 tries, I'm going to do, let's see, what's the actual percentage here?
[168:27.50]If it's a pie chart, you've got green makes up about, what, say 25%?
[168:31.28]30%, 25, 20, so that's like 35, like 40, 50, 60, 70, like, what would you call this?
[168:34.00]Like 10%, 20%?
[168:34.20]Maybe 15% for white?
[168:37.42]Would you consider that like 10% for white?
[168:39.24]5 to 10%?
[168:56.19]twelve percent okay so theoretically if we do this 100 times that should pop up 12 times and we're doing a prediction here uh is this if it will land on white or not I wonder how many people like not will germa get it in 10 tries okay
[169:24.37]Will I get white in 10 tries?
[169:26.43]I mean, theoretically, it should be between 10 and, like, 15 attempts.
[169:34.83]It'll pop up once.
[169:51.63]Why am I waiting?
[169:52.89]Let's go.
[169:53.25]Oh, wait.
[169:54.57]No, no, no.
[169:54.95]The reason why I'm waiting is because... Yeah, then if you see the first one... If it lands on the first one, right.
[170:00.00]Okay.
[170:02.20]I'm going to get it in 10 tries.
[170:05.66]All right.
[170:06.88]Close the pole.
[170:09.34]I'm going to go for it.
[170:10.94]Or can we?
[170:11.30]You have to wait?
[170:20.43]Okay, we can wait.
[170:31.13]20,000 on blue.
[170:36.45]Imagine if roulette table was not just red and black.
[170:38.43]Imagine if it was red, green, blue, yellow, white.
[170:42.23]I don't think anybody would play this.
[170:49.00]And it had the numbers too.
[170:59.57]Here we go.
[171:02.08]Will I get this in 10 attempts?
[171:05.92]I'm gonna laugh it's the first one.
[171:11.24]Temp number one is red.
[171:12.30]Sorry.
[171:15.97]Red.
[171:16.31]Temp number two.
[171:22.53]Go.
[171:27.83]Blue sucks.
[171:28.47]Actually, blue has come up a lot of times.
[171:33.86]Oh shit, that was almost there.
[171:35.00]Red again.
[171:35.34]This is easy money to bet against it.
[171:42.51]It's... I mean that... Yeah, it is.
[171:45.35]If you bet that I was gonna hit white... Remember, you guys have a... You guys are doing a yes or no, but your no has like a 90% chance to be correct.
[171:58.68]You know what I mean?
[171:59.58]Like, you're betting against the odds here, but you're not getting any benefit from it.
[172:04.73]If you guys were going to get, like, 10 to 1 channel points, that would make sense.
[172:11.96]But, like, if you're betting that this is not going to happen, you are going with what will probably happen.
[172:18.66]Oh.
[172:20.25]Oh, shit.
[172:20.75]It almost happened.
[172:29.16]This is number four.
[172:29.82]Not looking good.
[172:41.94]Not looking good.
[172:42.54]That's blue again.
[172:43.28]Not looking good.
[172:56.40]Should've went all-in on the other side.
[172:58.32]I would've... If it were my channel points and I had the opportunity to go all-in against the white, I would have absolutely put it... I would've done it.
[173:12.31]I mean, it could still happen.
[173:13.31]There's no such thing as a sure thing.
[173:16.26]So this is six.
[173:25.52]Nope.
[173:26.58]Looking pretty bleak.
[173:27.66]Here comes number seven.
[173:28.36]Here we go.
[173:41.07]I'm surprised this many people did white.
[173:42.59]That was almost 50-50.
[173:44.55]That's shocking to me.
[173:48.35]Nope.
[173:53.08]I was expecting like 90-10.
[173:56.22]There's only two more opportunities.
[174:11.59]No, it's not looking good.
[174:15.47]It's not looking good.
[174:16.49]This is the last chance here.
[174:22.47]Is it?
[174:26.42]Sorry, guys, if you voted for the white sliver here.
[174:31.70]Don't think you're gonna make... Oh.
[174:40.13]That was nine?
[174:40.75]What do you mean that was nine?
[174:41.89]That was ten, right?
[174:44.39]That was nine?
[174:44.95]No, it wasn't.
[174:46.91]That was ten, wasn't it?
[174:48.77]It's one more?
[174:49.43]That was eight.
[174:51.44]No, that was nine?
[174:52.12]That was nine?
[174:56.93]Oh, what?
[174:57.19]It was 9?
[174:57.59]I thought it was 9.
[175:05.74]That was 9.
[175:06.48]9?
[175:06.50]Are we keeping track?
[175:09.50]Is anybody keeping track of this?
[175:12.52]This is number 10 right now.
[175:13.64]Look.
[175:17.19]It was 9.
[175:17.49]Okay.
[175:18.35]You should be.
[175:19.07]I'm just not.
[175:36.22]That was nine.
[175:37.02]Yeah, that was nine.
[175:38.50]That's it.
[175:39.44]Sorry, everybody.
[175:42.59]That was such a sure thing, essentially, to win.
[175:51.37]Oh, I would have laughed if it went on white.
[175:52.85]Alright, I got one for you.
[176:00.20]You ready?
[176:00.58]You guys ready?
[176:01.10]Ready?
[176:02.43]Will it land on red on the next spin?
[176:07.09]Yes or no?
[176:16.45]Will red come up on the next spin?
[176:19.56]Yes or no?
[176:21.66]And 20 community subs from Goyke.
[176:24.36]Thank you, Goyke.
[176:30.59]Will it be red?
[176:31.81]Yes or no.
[176:32.61]On the next spin.
[176:35.48]You're literally playing baby roulette.
[176:37.30]Yeah, I know this is... Ow, you made me hurt my elbow.
[176:40.18]I know this is baby roulette.
[176:51.96]Yeah, this is like... I'm the dealer and you were just playing like five-year-old roulette.
[177:02.93]But no, but the- but the- hold on.
[177:03.87]But the dealer does not look at everybody and go, Hey, you guys think it's gonna land on red?
[177:10.09]Yeah, well, no.
[177:10.53]Yeah, they do.
[177:11.11]Because then you- yeah.
[177:12.57]They do.
[177:12.81]That's exactly what happens.
[177:16.33]Because then the person goes, Oh, I don't think so.
[177:18.35]I'm gonna put it on black.
[177:19.15]Or I'm gonna put it on, like, it's double zero or something.
[177:24.14]Will it land on red?
[177:25.14]You ready?
[177:50.63]I'm actually kind of nervous with some of you guys.
[177:52.11]All right.
[177:52.65]You ready?
[177:52.89]Here we go.
[177:55.07]Three, two, one, go.
[178:10.46]Oh, no.
[178:11.36]You just hate to see that.
[178:12.76]You hate to see that.
[178:14.16]You hate to see that.
[178:17.10]You actually hate to see that.
[178:20.25]That literally folded over.
[178:26.04]Oh no.
[178:26.60]Do it again.
[178:35.61]Okay.
[178:37.11]Will it land on Baloo this spin?
[178:41.41]What the fuck am I doing here?
[178:45.12]I'm doing this one more time.
[178:55.05]Will it land on blue this spin?
[179:03.10]Is it legal to do this?
[179:05.88]Play an arcade game where people... Where we use a pretend fake currency?
[179:14.93]Oh, that's a shit... That is a shitload of... Of that shitload of no's?
[179:21.81]Oh, man.
[179:22.29]That's 20... That's 20 million.
[179:27.92]That's 5 to 20 million right now.
[179:34.41]By the way, is this too much?
[179:36.17]The flashing?
[179:37.99]Should I look away or look up here or something?
[179:39.97]Should I look down?
[179:42.99]Is that too much?
[179:44.63]No?
[179:44.89]Okay.
[179:45.03]Alright, is it going to land on blue?
[179:50.83]We'll find out.

[183:02.11]I'm trying to practice.
[183:07.75]Yes, I want to play again.
[183:08.84]Of course I do.
[183:09.46]What are you guys voting on?
[183:14.48]On let go.
[183:17.57]One let go.
[183:43.94]This is the spot right here.
[183:44.66]Don't move.
[183:45.12]I got it.
[183:45.56]This is the spot literally right here.
[183:47.62]Don't move.
[183:49.93]Watch this shit.
[183:50.47]You ready?
[183:52.41]You ready for this?
[183:54.02]Check this out.
[184:25.98]It's gonna be a weird... What happened?
[184:28.28]What was the prediction?
[184:34.61]What was it for?
[184:35.07]Will he ever... Will he get over 50 points before quitting?
[184:38.59]How many points do I have?
[184:58.98]As a gamer, you try to find the extreme exploit to get it every single fucking time.
[185:04.58]I'll get it.
[185:05.88]It's going to be one little spot around here where I can hold the button down and drain every single shot.
[185:14.90]I'm not trying to do it normally.
[185:16.06]I'm trying to win.
[185:16.72]I already got over 50 points.
[185:20.96]Yeah, didn't I?
[185:31.10]It's close.
[185:31.62]Got it.
[185:48.69]Got it.
[186:01.36]Wee!
[186:33.79]Y'all just lost.
[186:34.35]Y'all just lost, I'm sorry.
[186:41.25]Holy shit, there's a lot here.
[186:51.59]That was sick.
[186:52.37]I told you, as a gamer, we're very analytical.
[186:55.89]We take all the situations presented in front of us with the least, the best possible outcome.
[187:01.56]The skill, you know what I mean?
[187:03.22]I'm a gamer like you.
[187:04.02]Let me turn my fucking lights on.
[187:06.94]There we go.
[187:12.34]Ooh.
[187:13.90]Ice hockey.
[187:22.97]I think I've made this joke before and this reference before, but I hate playing this game.
[187:27.23]Because...
[187:29.10]To play this game and have fun, the person that you are playing against, you both have to have the unwritten rule that no one's gonna, like, smash it into the other person's hand.
[187:38.22]Because I've played plenty of times this little, like, shuffleboard ice hockey with people, and they're fucking slamming it as hard as they can, and it, like, BOOM!
[187:46.43]Hits you right in the finger, and it hurts for, like, a week.
[187:49.73]You've got to have an understanding that this is just like a joke.
[187:52.12]It's just fun.
[187:53.28]You're not really putting full force behind any of your moves.
[187:56.08]Unfortunately, some people don't care.
[187:57.58]And they act like they're using the hammer and smashing the test of strength thing.
[188:05.19]I hate playing against people because you never know who you're going to get.
[188:09.09]And who you think is somebody that you might connect with the unwritten rule, they hit it as hard as you've ever seen anybody hit it before.
[188:17.96]And they are having so much fucking fun.
[188:21.24]And you just want to get away from it so bad.
[188:25.14]After one game, you're like, Oh, that was cool.
[188:27.62]Let's see what else there is here.
[188:29.68]And they want to do it like fucking five times in a row.
[188:31.50]I don't want to do that.
[188:33.58]I don't want to play shuffle ice hockey thing.
[188:35.98]Air hockey.
[188:37.18]Ten times in a row.
[188:38.00]You do.
[188:39.52]Because you're a fucking psycho.
[188:40.82]And you just want to hit the thing as hard as you can.
[188:42.86]And... Sure, I'm... Yeah.
[188:45.70]I would consider myself a pretty...
[188:48.75]I know the arcade very well.
[188:49.85]You know, I know you like the air, the feeling of the air in your hand.
[188:52.83]You're one to talk.
[188:54.03]I just like the air.
[188:55.09]Honestly, I just want to... I would like to lie down on this.
[188:59.59]Does that make me a fucking weirdo?
[189:01.40]I would love to just like lie down on my back and lie on this.
[189:05.34]All the air holes.
[189:07.24]That would be so cool.
[189:08.06]Why don't they sell these as like old beds?
[189:11.64]I would love to be able to do that.
[189:15.63]If I could be in my house and just lie on my back naked on one of these... That'd be fucking... That'd be like after the shower.
[189:23.26]Imagine getting out of the shower.
[189:25.54]And you just lie on your back on this.
[189:29.10]That would be like the greatest thing ever.
[189:32.86]Especially during like a hot day or something.
[189:34.35]That'd be so awesome.
[189:35.25]It'd be like part of my morning routine.
[189:41.57]Why naked?
[189:42.17]So every air hole can, like, get every, like, part of you.
[189:45.23]Otherwise, if you have... I don't know.
[189:46.83]I'm kicking the shit out of this guy.
[190:02.36]You can always tell when they're gonna do a huge move, because it starts to bounce really slowly back and forth, and they go...
[190:09.03]If you see your friend's lips do that, back up.
[190:12.05]They're not gonna score, they're gonna knock it off the table, and it's gonna be a- they're gonna make a scene.
[190:16.13]You see that, fucking back up.
[190:17.57]I'm ser- I've seen that face a thousand times.
[190:20.08]It's this.
[190:28.74]I know that face.
[190:31.61]And I am backing the fuck up.
[190:54.80]Sour tower.
[190:55.81]Baby arm.
[190:56.49]Did I win?
[190:58.37]Oh, shit.
[190:58.67]I won.
[190:58.95]How many tickets did I get for that?
[191:02.97]Oh, my goodness.
[191:03.57]That's a lot.
[191:09.61]If you win against these guys, they'll come out and fight you.
[191:11.57]Wait.
[191:11.89]Oh, this is the dude with the bat.
[191:15.20]Wait.
[191:15.58]Does that mean his bat is not on him?
[191:22.94]Hmm.
[191:25.66]What else is up here?
[191:26.64]Oh, I want to go over here.
[191:30.88]Have I seen the, um... I want to see what's over here.
[191:36.80]Oh.
[191:38.82]You're in birthday mode?
[191:39.70]Yeah, yeah.
[191:40.10]I'm in birthday mode.
[191:45.10]What's up here?
[191:47.30]Whoa.
[191:49.24]Oh, this is one of the endings.
[191:50.28]This is cool.
[191:50.72]Feels birthday, man.
[191:53.51]It does feel birthday, man.
[191:58.34]I want an ooey gooey bear.
[192:05.36]Nice.
[192:08.79]Did I play all the ones in here?
[192:13.49]That's under construction.
[192:14.49]The shooting gallery.
[192:16.03]Oh, what did I do with my jaw?
[192:20.57]Shooting gallery is not done yet.
[192:21.91]Okay.
[192:24.55]I want to hear my jaw.
[192:25.31]Listen to this.
[192:25.67]Can you guys hear that?
[192:30.58]My jaw.
[192:30.86]My jaw's fucked up.
[192:37.14]I've never showed you that before.
[192:39.51]Watch this.
[192:46.39]FTMJ, I do.
[192:52.39]Ooh.
[192:53.22]No.
[192:53.70]I already beat this one.
[192:54.94]I think I've seen everything in here.
[192:55.88]That means I have to go back to Dizzy Bird.
[193:01.87]But first I'm going to order like 10 pizzas for everybody here.
[193:08.49]Hey there.
[193:09.53]What can I do for you?
[193:11.71]Sounds good.
[193:12.29]Hey there.
[193:13.03]What can I do for you?
[193:16.57]One grease bucket coming your way.
[193:18.17]What can I get for you?
[193:21.24]Alright, let me get right on that for you.
[193:22.96]What can I whip up for you?
[193:25.86]One grease bucket coming your way.
[193:27.46]What can I get for you?
[193:30.23]One grease bucket coming your way.
[193:31.84]What can I get for you?
[193:32.92]Alright, let me see them.
[193:34.68]Sounds good.
[193:35.26]I'll fire one up fresh for you right now.
[193:39.32]I want a pizza so bad now.
[193:43.12]I didn't play the lava game?
[193:44.02]I don't think I can.
[193:44.60]It's just out of order.
[193:45.22]Did I just spend like 80 bucks for one pizza?
[193:57.73]Hey there.
[193:58.77]What can I do for you?
[194:00.86]Sounds good.
[194:01.56]I'll fire one up fresh for you right now.
[194:05.10]See if I can get the pizza in the basket.
[194:09.08]This voice sounds like a bit from you.
[194:10.79]Hey there.
[194:12.49]Hey there.
[194:14.67]I'll fire a fresh one up for you.
[194:16.29]Let's see.
[194:16.87]Hold on.
[194:18.71]What can I get for you?
[194:20.17]What can I get for you?
[194:21.57]All right.
[194:25.47]Let me get right on that for you.
[194:27.59]Otto?
[194:28.31]Can you hear Otto?
[194:28.87]He's going...
[194:31.06]Just woke up and he's going... Alright, I'll get right on that for you.
[194:41.10]What is going on over here?
[194:43.76]Just rolled around instead of going... Oh, I can do it.
[194:49.13]What can I get for you, little winner?
[194:50.75]What can I get for you, little winner?
[194:52.23]Anything you need.
[194:56.87]Anything you need.
[194:57.90]Thank you, Uncle Bill.
[194:59.12]Thank you.
[195:10.83]Hey there.
[195:11.95]What can I do for you?
[195:13.87]One grease bucket coming your way.
[195:15.61]One grease bucket?
[195:16.55]What the heck?
[195:17.29]It should be fresh and radiant.
[195:22.13]Go, Otto.
[195:22.59]Oh, you can't see him.
[195:26.71]He's not on the bed.
[195:30.29]He is now leaving the room.
[195:32.93]He has left the room.
[195:33.98]Otto has left the building.
[195:35.00]He's left the room.
[195:35.46]One grease bucket coming your way.
[195:40.42]to lie.
[195:40.88]No, he literally ran over here.
[195:42.66]How high can I stack this?
[195:47.80]How many of these can I do?
[195:48.58]That's just mean.
[195:52.70]That's my normal speaking voice.
[195:56.56]No, no, no.
[195:57.01]This is not me doing a voice.
[195:58.11]This is like whenever something funny potentially happens on screen, that happens to my voice.
[196:03.75]If I start to laugh about something or react harshly while laughing, that's how I talk.
[196:10.52]It's actually what it sounds like.
[196:14.57]What can I get for you there, big winner?
[196:18.45]Anything you need, youngster.
[196:19.73]You tell Uncle Bill thank you.
[196:25.58]Where are all the coins?
[196:26.54]What do you mean?
[196:33.96]What can I whip up for you?
[196:37.41]One grease bucket coming your way.
[196:40.35]Remember the lava game?
[196:41.19]It's out of order.
[196:41.91]Look, it's out of order.
[196:43.94]It's not ready yet.
[196:50.54]Why am I buying this many pizzas?
[196:52.26]Because I want it to stack up to the lip here.
[196:55.46]So when I add a next one after the one that hits the lip, the physics will go, and it'll explode.
[197:05.97]Okay.
[197:15.01]One side actually works, really?
[197:16.31]Oh shit, okay, I'll play in a minute.
[197:22.18]We're getting really close to our yellow bell moment.
[197:25.66]Our laughing out loud moment is so close.
[197:28.66]It's very, very close.
[197:34.66]I can't wait till it goes all the way to the top and then it starts to spread out really quickly and the game crashes and it goes... What can I get for you?
[197:54.71]One grease bucket coming your way.
[198:02.63]Let us bet.
[198:04.51]Okay, hold on.
[198:09.44]It's pretty much there.
[198:12.78]Okay, you want to bet?
[198:15.06]Will there be a laugh out loud moment once five more pizzas are added on top of this?
[198:25.13]Wait, no, but that's very subjective.
[198:27.57]That's incredibly subjective.
[198:31.71]Well, all right, hold on.
[198:32.69]How are you going to bet on that?
[198:36.56]You can't even bet on anything.
[198:39.41]Will a pizza hit the floor?
[198:42.39]Will a pizza hit the floor?
[198:44.11]Is that a good one?
[198:52.72]I don't think any of these work.
[198:55.90]I'm just going to keep going.
[198:56.56]Thank you.
[199:07.13]Let's see what happens.
[199:10.75]They're kind of just folding.
[199:11.87]They're starting to squish.
[199:27.74]It's gonna freak the fuck out.
[199:30.30]It might.
[199:31.36]It really could.
[199:32.02]It might freak the fuck out here in another two or three of them.
[199:35.51]Especially if I really throw a curveball there and I put a soda on top.
[199:38.27]Prediction started.
[199:39.13]What's the prediction for?
[199:40.13]I can't even... What's the bet?
[200:07.16]I cannot see what the bed is.
[200:08.68]I have no idea what the bed is.
[200:10.90]I need more money.
[200:22.37]Oh, I saw it.
[200:28.93]Oh, it's still going.
[200:33.18]Shit, it's going to despawn.
[200:34.36]Is it going to despawn?
[200:36.34]I hope not.
[200:41.11]Keep it in line of sight.
[200:41.91]I think there's a bug on my head.
[200:44.61]I swear to God.
[200:58.89]Still there.
[201:06.41]I don't even know what's going on.
[201:09.48]It's a bug in my hair.
[201:21.77]Okay, back to the pizzas.
[201:28.41]Me out.
[201:33.30]Out of my way.
[201:35.86]Okay, don't touch them.
[201:36.74]They're still going.
[201:37.48]More.
[201:38.12]More.
[201:44.59]I hate this scammer.
[201:46.11]I don't even know what's going on.
[202:01.64]Oh!
[202:03.44]There it goes.
[202:08.04]What can I whip up for you?
[202:11.78]All right, let's go put pizzas everywhere.
[202:14.52]All right, bye.
[203:11.55]Get around.
[203:24.53]Okay.
[203:25.77]You're evil.
[203:26.59]Go to the lava game.
[203:27.61]Oh, right.
[203:28.01]Okay.
[203:32.88]A pizza in one.
[203:34.00]All right.
[203:34.30]Lava.
[203:35.82]Oh, shit.
[203:36.38]It is.
[203:36.88]It does exist.
[203:39.27]It do exist!
[203:42.71]M&Ms!
[203:42.95]Uh, how do I play?
[203:51.94]Is the thing for my... Are you sure I can play it?
[203:59.80]Oh my goodness!
[204:09.50]I want 10 coins.
[204:12.44]Wait, is it a baseball?
[204:15.04]Oh, it's like a... I have no idea what's going on.
[204:18.52]Oh, shit.
[204:19.06]Cool.
[204:22.89]I have 200 balls?
[204:24.29]Trying to get them in the middle here.
[204:30.79]Light for spin.
[204:37.63]Oh, get in there.
[204:38.64]Nice.
[204:41.08]Just fill up the middle here.
[204:41.91]Here we go.
[204:46.23]Right in the middle.
[204:46.93]All right.
[204:47.15]Over this side.
[204:47.63]This is going to be big money over here.
[204:50.25]Push these ones down and light the spin up.
[204:53.32]There it is.
[204:53.94]All right.
[204:54.20]Cool.
[204:54.46]Spin.
[204:54.72]20 extra credits.
[205:01.26]What's the blue?
[205:09.17]I don't get it um there really is not much to get with the coin pusher you just put coins or balls down here and you're just trying to push the stuff off and they're doing they do an optical illusion we're right at the bottom here right here nice there's an optical illusion which a lot of people don't know this this is this goes up so this looks like that it actually looks like this
[205:34.99]But it's an optical illusion.
[205:35.81]They have mirrors and shit in there.
[205:37.17]So when you push the coins up and they look like they're hanging over the edge, they actually they're up on a lip.
[205:43.06]That's absolute horse shit.
[205:48.08]I'm not going to look at what this is, but I just bet wisely because I have no idea what you're betting on.
[205:56.06]Okay, if it's like, am I going to say like PP in the next 10 minutes?
[205:58.92]Then let's find out.
[206:03.80]I want that blue ball.
[206:15.31]Oh shit, what's that?
[206:15.93]Lava?
[206:16.63]Lava mayhem.
[206:17.57]Five spins times three.
[206:22.03]That's 55 times three.
[206:23.37]Alright, give me a huge one.
[206:28.71]Oh, that's nothing.
[206:29.29]That sucks.
[206:29.96]What about ice ball?
[206:37.10]40 times three.
[206:37.48]Come on.
[206:42.68]Land on something cool.
[206:46.63]Alright, this ball.
[206:47.21]It's almost going to go down, this ball.
[206:49.59]Come on, give me the big one.
[206:51.49]Big one.
[207:01.97]Got it.
[207:03.53]That's 500 tickets.
[207:04.57]Alright, what happened?
[207:05.30]What did you guys vote on?
[207:08.18]What did you guys bet on?
[207:12.98]It was refunded?
[207:14.38]What was it?
[207:21.05]Wait, we got another... I don't... I'm not gonna look at this one.
[207:39.31]I love these machines.
[207:40.47]They're so much fun.
[207:42.13]God, I wanted to just... I want one... You know what?
[207:44.33]I want one in my house.
[207:48.89]It's just relaxing.
[207:50.69]It's relaxing to, like, watch the coins push.
[207:53.77]How much do you... Okay.
[207:54.79]How much is just, like, a coin pusher machine?
[208:01.13]I can't even look at chat because I don't know what you're betting on.
[208:02.93]But it can't be that much money, right?
[208:04.81]If I can just have one of these just, like, right over here.
[208:07.58]And I can just sit there and just play it for fun.
[208:09.90]Just when I'm just hanging out.
[208:13.90]I find this to be very relaxing.
[208:16.00]No bets.
[208:16.32]What do you mean no bets?
[208:16.84]No bets.
[208:19.36]My bets are over.
[208:20.18]Okay, what is it?
[208:20.86]Will Dremel earn more than 500 tickets this go?
[208:22.78]Okay.
[208:24.18]What's the new one here?
[208:30.12]It's 12 grand for a coin pusher.
[208:31.72]No, it's not.
[208:37.16]3,200 tickets.
[208:37.74]Damn.
[208:42.52]Those are the results.
[208:43.28]Oh, okay.
[208:45.34]I want to go to the... I want to go to the... I want to set up another casino.
[208:56.07]I was going to say, where the fuck are these?
[208:57.57]Where are these from?
[209:00.07]I want to go to... I want to do Dizzy Bird.
[209:04.83]Where's Dizzy Bird?
[209:07.63]Carries gas.
[209:11.80]I don't know.
[209:12.10]Where am I going?
[209:12.56]All right.
[209:24.02]I want to go...
[209:29.86]to... is it the beach?
[209:31.18]Where's that, uh, the original one with the dizzy bird?
[209:47.91]Don't act like this is not how all you guys play GTA.
[209:51.79]You just look at the line, the purple line, and you just drive with the purple line on the mini-map.
[209:57.51]You don't even look at the road.
[210:16.85]Because I can just go like 100 miles per hour and just go like this.
[210:20.58]And just see exactly where I'm going.
[210:37.25]Gas, gas, gas.
[210:39.21]You know, okay.
[210:41.05]Everybody's saying gas.
[210:42.09]I thought you were just saying like gas, like gas, like gas, like gas.
[210:45.67]I thought you were doing this, like this thing.
[210:54.13]Yes.
[210:55.42]Yes.
[210:55.86]I thought you were doing that.
[210:57.24]Yes.
[210:57.52]Yes.
[210:57.92]Yes.
[210:58.58]I did not know that my car was running out of gas.
[211:05.74]Oh, cool.
[211:06.02]What's in here?
[211:10.53]I really thought that's what you guys are doing.
[211:11.79]Where's the gas?
[211:14.12]Where's my uncle?
[211:16.10]Jerry's gas station.
[211:22.52]Back in there.
[211:22.90]Where's the gas station?
[211:36.91]Jerry's gas and go.
[211:38.27]Can I make it there?
[211:53.31]Where the hell is it?
[212:05.07]Fill it up.
[212:15.46]How do I buy gas?
[212:18.18]Almost blew it up.
[212:35.64]Use it.
[212:42.04]Pull up the gas.
[212:44.16]Oh.
[212:50.41]Deadly nerve agent.
[212:52.03]Alright, now we gotta go.
[212:58.82]Over here this way.
[213:07.79]And we gotta go down to the pier?
[213:10.90]Where do we go?
[213:12.84]Where do we go?
[213:14.00]Where do we go?
[213:14.36]Where do we go?
[213:14.76]Where do we go?
[213:17.48]I want Dizzy Bird.
[213:19.34]I don't care about anything but Dizzy Bird.
[213:24.76]Down to the pier grounds?
[213:33.25]Honk?
[213:40.42]I have to go to Larry's.
[213:41.30]I can't even... Where is it?
[214:07.47]Go to... Leave me alone.
[214:15.46]There's Larry's.
[214:17.96]Larry's.
[214:24.66]I want to get the... I want to get that music again.
[214:26.97]That's the Guy Fieri takes a bite out of a hamburger diners, drive-ins, and dive song.
[214:31.93]Where is that?
[214:42.16]I have to hear it again.
[214:44.66]Okay, so here we go.
[215:03.20]He's about to lean in.
[215:04.38]He's gonna take the bite.
[215:18.34]Where is it?
[215:18.78]Where is it?
[215:19.22]Where is it?
[215:19.54]Where is it?
[215:20.22]Where's that coming from?
[215:22.10]Where's it coming from?
[215:37.41]Where's the music coming from?
[215:50.70]A house?
[216:06.59]What?
[216:11.09]Where'd it go?
[216:20.66]I didn't even get it.
[216:21.36]I didn't even get it.
[216:22.00]I didn't get it.
[216:24.12]It didn't even come out.
[216:25.64]Oh, there it is.
[216:27.11]This shit's stuck.
[216:43.06]Listen to the boys go round and round, you know.
[216:45.58]Hope the number 11 holds up to your W today.

[217:35.87]They're flipping up hot pancakes and comfort food.
[217:38.69]How am I crouching?
[217:57.35]Still in the car.
[218:01.15]Welcome to Triple D. Where did you... No, no, no.
[218:09.31]He doesn't do that.
[218:13.75]He's driving around.
[218:15.69]No, he doesn't do that.
[218:16.70]He doesn't do that.
[218:21.48]Okay, where are we?
[218:22.62]I need to go to Larry's Arcade.

[218:32.26]Let me do that.
[218:33.34]God, can I catch a break?
[218:46.05]What's this?
[218:46.59]What's this?
[218:47.07]What's this new badge?
[218:48.65]Wait, what is this?
[218:49.23]Predicted yes.
[218:54.01]Predicted no.
[218:54.91]Wait, what?
[219:00.40]Why does everyone have a badge that says predicted yes or no?
[219:08.39]I thought it was on sub only for a second.
[219:10.15]I was like, what's going on?
[219:22.25]Oh, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[219:40.10]Murderer.

[220:21.20]Just exchange the presents for money.
[220:23.12]So I can get it and I can put it in here.
[220:24.66]What do you mean no?
[220:31.66]No what?
[220:36.37]Why the hell would you vote yes for that?
[220:41.07]That's a guaranteed free channel points.
[220:43.41]Guaranteed.
[221:01.52]I thought you cared.
[221:02.50]I tried!
[221:03.07]What do you mean I thought I cared?
[221:04.07]Of course I do.
[221:04.65]This game is too hard.
[221:35.81]what the fuck are you doing hey germa I appreciate you could do bill murray I know I can't even read what you're writing I'm just can you please do a bill murray impression I'd be very pleased you said you did said impression in case you didn't hear me when I first asked you I'd like you to do a bill murray impression um okay I guess I'll be doing bill murray for at least a little while
[222:09.39]Hey, I don't know what you're talking about.
[222:16.73]What are you thinking?
[222:17.91]Get out of my face.
[222:20.41]He's a fucking guy.
[222:21.31]He's like a guy that speaks with a low tone.
[222:23.15]I'm gonna use my powers to make the machine go green the next time I use it.
[222:45.45]Must play Dizzy Bird.
[222:50.02]Must play Dizzy Bird.
[223:17.14]That's my token.
[223:21.86]It's out of order.
[223:22.59]I think it's out of order.
[223:25.81]Let's go.
[223:33.67]I don't think I've ever done this before.
[223:37.25]I've hit the green once, but I've never won twice.
[223:39.17]It's not going to happen.
[223:55.90]We're in sub only?
[223:57.55]Oh, are they getting out of control?
[223:58.81]Sub only.
[224:01.18]I didn't even snap.
[224:02.02]That hurt.
[224:11.77]Go all the way up.
[224:12.85]It needs to be red to go up there.
[224:14.11]Alright, I need red to go up there.
[224:15.47]I don't know what you're voting on.
[224:17.91]Or predicting or whatever.
[224:19.11]But you're probably all going to lose your money.
[224:22.49]You're probably all just going to lose your money.
[224:24.51]Because I'm definitely not going to do the thing that you say I'm going to do.
[224:32.53]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[224:36.17]Shit.
[224:36.37]Shit.
[224:47.41]I'll never get the green.
[224:48.17]It's never gonna happen.
[224:53.43]Charged and ready.
[224:54.17]Alright.
[224:57.59]This is the one to get.
[224:58.39]This is the easy one.
[224:59.23]Oh my fucking god.
[225:03.51]I just don't know.
[225:03.97]I don't know what to do.
[225:18.85]I gotta go up to red for this shit?
[225:20.70]What?
[225:22.12]So if it's on the top layer, it's gotta be red.
[225:25.44]That's stupid.
[225:26.74]What's going on?
[225:46.65]There's a kid stuck in here.
[225:55.17]I got distracted because there's a fucking kid stuck in here.
[225:57.63]Refund.
[226:05.59]What?
[226:14.13]I lost... Pay, pay.
[226:15.32]I don't know what...
[226:30.38]Actually, Scam, I'm not paying any attention to your casino gambling betting stream.

[228:00.25]Not enough.
[228:02.27]Not enough.
[228:04.84]I wouldn't mind if you were a full-time Dizzy Bird streamer.
[228:14.52]That might be the worst fucking stream I could ever think of.
[228:17.58]Got it!
[228:20.44]Can you imagine if I just played Dizzy Bird every single day?
[228:27.18]That would be the world's shittiest stream.
[228:34.70]That would be the world's shittiest stream.
[228:37.69]Hold on.
[228:41.59]There's people like behind me.
[228:42.77]There's people that are crowding me.
[228:53.65]I have to back up because these people just literally... I'm going to start moving people out of the way.
[228:59.96]You little dicks.
[229:01.76]Get away from me.
[229:03.29]You dickheads.
[229:05.87]And now my shot got screwed up because of somebody just pushing into me.
[229:13.57]No, I don't want to play again because I'm...
[229:33.73]What's the platypus's name from that Phineas and Ferb show?
[229:42.80]Well, he's on the screen right now, but he's orange.
[229:48.21]That's it.
[229:48.55]That's going to be the one.
[229:50.89]Damn it.
[230:04.23]Perry the Platypus.
[230:06.41]Oh, Perry the Platypus.
[230:07.79]It's so nice to see you.
[230:08.76]I've seen that show before and I don't like it.
[230:34.13]All right.
[230:35.49]The bonus is on... It's back there.
[230:47.06]Oh!
[230:49.90]I don't... I don't like... I'm kidding.
[230:51.32]I like the show, obviously.
[230:53.22]I don't like the show.
[230:54.24]I don't care.
[230:55.04]What?
[230:55.26]I don't... I don't watch that show.
[230:57.16]I've seen like a few episodes randomly.
[231:00.44]I'm sure it's fine.
[231:01.96]I'm sure it's a good show.
[231:03.48]I've seen like three episodes.
[231:05.85]I don't know.
[231:06.29]I don't watch Phineas and fucking Ferb.
[231:09.25]I don't.
[231:09.93]I've seen like two episodes.
[231:16.57]I'm sure it's just fine.
[231:19.02]I'm sure it's a good show.
[231:20.26]I'm sure it's funny and engaging.
[231:22.42]I don't know anything about it.
[231:32.08]You're a coward.
[231:33.60]I don't know anything about the show.
[231:34.88]I know.
[231:37.06]I do know something about the show.
[231:38.06]They have two kids.
[231:42.05]One Phineas, one Ferb.
[231:44.01]And Phineas is the one that talks.
[231:46.13]Right?
[231:46.39]And Ferb says like one line an episode.
[231:48.19]That's why I remember hearing that.
[231:49.73]I don't see.
[231:50.09]I don't watch the show.
[231:52.85]Phineas is like, I know what we're going to do today.
[231:54.63]Right?
[231:54.87]And like at the end of the episode, Ferb was like, oh, that shit was absolutely ridiculous.
[231:59.18]Now, wasn't it?
[232:00.72]I've seen it before.
[232:03.04]That's a good show.
[232:07.60]I would have just got out of my seat and like sprinted out of the room, running, saying, please don't hurt me.
[232:13.09]Like, my pants situation, that would be bad.
[232:16.12]I probably would get in trouble.
[232:49.91]I'm wearing pants.
[232:51.57]That's not what I meant.
[232:53.53]I meant like I don't want to get up and like turn and have my like ass in the camera.
[232:58.57]Because I know what happened the last time I turned and like sprinted over into the corner or out of the room.
[233:04.39]My fucking ass was in the camera and you all zoomed in on it and made it huge.
[233:13.71]This person... Somebody help this person.
[233:23.91]I actually have to stop doing this.
[233:25.61]I'm done.
[233:26.34]I've won it twice.
[233:33.99]I have to stop playing this.
[233:37.05]But anyways, so you've got... You've got Phineas and Ferb.
[233:40.19]Those are the two.
[233:41.53]And you've got Dr. Doofenshmirtz, right?
[233:44.43]Who's the evil... And then you have Perry.
[233:47.23]Perry the Vladapuss, who's a secret agent.
[233:50.27]Who cares?
[233:50.71]Why do I have to keep telling... Why do I have to justify that I know the show?
[234:01.69]Oh, and then it goes...
[234:04.69]Just check us out.
[234:05.47]We're Phineas and Ferb and we're gonna make up.
[234:08.49]We're gonna have a ball.
[234:10.09]I've seen the show before.
[234:24.48]It's wrong.
[234:25.12]It's something like that.
[234:27.22]Look, for somebody that's seen two or three episodes of this entire show, I think I got the idea.
[234:31.63]I think I get it.
[234:45.05]He owns the boxed set.
[234:46.21]How long have you been playing this for?
[234:55.50]I don't know.
[234:56.04]15, 20 minutes?
[234:56.42]There's inner complexities of that show.
[235:00.52]I don't know.
[235:00.82]I'm sure there are.
[235:01.44]Whatever.
[235:02.52]I'm sure the show is just fine.
[235:04.82]I'm sure it's a good show.
[235:05.60]I don't know anything about it.
[235:10.41]I went too far and I said that I didn't like the show as a joke to try to make everybody go, well, he doesn't like Phineas and Ferb.
[235:16.30]What is he, a fucking dick?
[235:19.16]I went a little too far.
[235:28.56]Backpedal Andy.
[235:32.66]I so badly just want us to start like yell singing the theme song.
[235:48.89]Is this your sorry video?
[235:53.35]I'm telling you, it looks like the platypus.
[235:56.19]And finally, I did it.
[235:57.65]I fucking hate this game.
[236:00.69]This is a pre-recording.
[236:02.87]Hey.
[236:05.41]Jojo Master1 just wrote at 7.56 Pacific Time today that they said it was a pre-recorded stream.
[236:13.15]And it's not.
[236:14.58]How would I have been able to do that?
[236:30.77]And they're like rocking the fuck out.
[236:32.50]I'm done.
[236:32.98]Move on, we've been here for six hours.
[237:19.40]Resident Sleeper.
[237:21.06]Why would I record that?
[237:22.22]That's not even funny.
[237:23.96]Resident Sleeper.
[237:25.10]It's not funny.
[237:25.60]That's just stupid.
[237:26.90]I was like, that's a good one.
[237:29.70]Now I can pull it back here.
[237:30.64]The game won't let me leave.
[237:52.16]This is pathetic.
[238:00.67]Is this new?
[238:03.95]Oh, I never won this one, did I?
[238:07.27]Check us out with Phineas and Ferb.
[238:09.29]We're gonna have a ball.
[238:12.20]It's stuck in my head now.
[238:13.32]It's a good song.
[238:14.00]It's a good show.
[238:15.00]It's a show that's very engaging to its audience that is a fan of it.
[238:38.26]I just love the beef stew it's the best thing they have here pizza is the best thing that they have in the entire place it's my favorite and they've been cracking this joint since 1932 since 1974 and it was made by this guy
[239:04.30]And he goes... All the way to the top.
[239:28.36]All the way to the top.
[239:29.42]And we let go now.
[239:32.96]How many drugs are you on right now?
[239:35.25]Be honest.
[239:38.99]Zero.
[239:41.39]Besides coffee.
[239:42.03]I don't do drugs.
[239:44.35]Everybody thinks like, oh, he must be on drugs.
[239:47.77]He must be on drugs.
[239:51.17]I got it!
[240:03.55]I've never got that before.
[240:04.35]It's the first time I've gotten it.
[240:05.78]How much is that for?
[240:06.74]Why can't you see my brain?
[240:08.12]You can see my brain.
[240:13.22]That was a mid-tier one.
[240:18.20]How much is it for?
[240:18.99]A thousand fucking tickets.
[240:20.03]Holy shit.
[240:20.37]What's the top one for then?
[240:23.55]Not enough loot?

[243:44.55]I would love it if he would just stay over there, but he doesn't see.
[243:47.14]He doesn't want to.
[243:48.16]Look.
[243:49.74]He hates me.

[245:48.05]I guess I could see the other ones.
[246:04.23]I went to a job interview and they asked me what my weaknesses were and I said everything.
[246:07.83]I don't think I'm going to get the job.
[246:09.35]Um... Well, that was your mistake.
[246:23.10]You didn't go in full Darth Vader costume.
[246:27.79]Going like this.
[246:39.17]You didn't have the full Darth Vader on.
[246:45.10]Fallout 76 sucks.
[246:48.46]That's a weird thing to say randomly.
[246:50.84]Somebody gave 76 gifted subs.
[246:58.25]Okay.
[246:58.59]Well, thank you.
[246:59.39]Thank you for the gifted subs.

[248:35.12]I'm not doing a Simpsons character again.
[248:38.92]Only in extreme circumstances.
[248:50.47]This is not an extreme circumstance.
[248:52.35]No, wait, why would this be?
[249:00.97]Why is it?
[249:01.41]This is not an extreme circumstance.
[249:10.56]Do it.
[249:17.86]All right.
[249:20.17]I'm going to count my tickets and then I'm going to see you tomorrow.
[249:23.33]I think we've seen all the new content.
[249:27.07]I extremely need to hear it.
[249:38.38]I can't do Homer Simpson.
[249:41.49]You're going to get me.
[249:42.13]I'm telling you.

[251:58.72]lol beans tomorrow we're doing pikmin tomorrow if for some reason I do not have I there's no reason why I shouldn't have pikmin but if for some crazy reason I don't have it tomorrow then we'll figure something out pikmin 2 is the plan though probably around the same time around 4 30 pacific I know we've been starting it like later recently but I've been getting up a lot later recently
[252:28.88]Are you going to do Pikmin 1 and 3 afterwards?
[252:30.60]I really don't know.
[252:34.80]It depends how much I like Pikmin 2.
