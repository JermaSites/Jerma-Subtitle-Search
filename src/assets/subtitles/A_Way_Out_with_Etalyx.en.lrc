[00:10.94]Swear to fucking god.
[00:12.12]I'm getting on a bus as soon as I can.
[00:15.56]I'm just gonna get on my shit, and I'm gonna get in a bus, and just go across the fucking whole country.
[00:21.71]I'm gonna take a pin and drop it on a fucking globe, and find a place that has internet and power that works.
[00:30.05]Reliably.
[00:32.58]Fuck this shithole town that I live in.
[00:35.00]I'm serious.
[00:36.86]It's ridiculous.
[00:39.08]I have internet half the time that I live here.
[00:41.32]Oh my god, it makes me fucking angry.
[00:45.55]Yeah, I guess maybe one day we'll fucking fix those poles.
[00:49.25]What is that?
[00:50.61]Oh, don't worry.
[00:53.59]Give me a break.
[00:58.01]What do we have?
[00:58.57]What do we have?
[00:59.05]What do we got?
[00:59.43]Like some issues here?
[01:01.14]With the node in your entire neighborhood?
[01:04.76]Ah, who cares?
[01:06.61]It's not a priority.
[01:09.53]Oh, I'm so sick and tired of this shit.
[01:14.27]I'm just getting in a bus.
[01:17.69]Fuck the Oscars.
[01:22.94]When's the road trip gonna happen?
[01:24.16]I don't know, maybe soon.
[01:25.62]Anyways, hi.
[01:28.10]Hopefully this holds out long enough for us to play A Way Out.
[01:31.90]Which we're in a town that's been really, really, really excited for.
[01:36.66]Speaking of that guy, why don't we poke him a little bit here?
[01:40.20]I don't even know where my phone is.
[01:45.56]Where is my phone?
[01:47.72]Oh, I don't even care.
[01:48.44]This has been such a disaster trying to get my computer to work.
[01:52.98]Let me just tap him.
[01:55.87]And say hi.
[01:57.89]I'm streaming.
[02:03.85]Oh yeah, we're gonna play the right characters, don't worry.
[02:09.23]But, welcome.
[02:11.21]Happy Friday.
[02:12.99]Hope you're having a good day.
[02:15.62]I was until I tried to load up the video game and connect to my friend.
[02:20.76]Then the day went down, down the tubes.
[02:27.80]Going to Las Vegas?
[02:28.44]I'm living in Las Vegas.
[02:30.28]Oh boy, I can't wait.
[02:31.24]I wonder if... I'll unmute here so you can hear me.
[02:46.29]I think he's just hanging out for a little bit.
[02:51.33]His stream is currently going.
[02:52.93]If you don't know what A Way Out is, A Way Out is a co-op game.
[02:59.47]That you have to play in co-op, I guess.
[03:01.97]To get the best experience.
[03:04.35]Seems pretty fun.
[03:06.49]So, just bear with me for two seconds.
[03:10.06]While we wait for Italics.
[03:11.38]Get yourself comfortable.
[03:13.10]See you in just a moment.
[04:16.72]Why, hello there.
[04:19.41]All right.
[04:20.47]Hi there.
[04:20.97]Everything good?
[04:22.11]Everything clean?
[04:24.69]Yes.
[04:24.83]You know, everything perfect?
[04:26.67]I had my meltdown.
[04:27.67]I had my pre-stream meltdown.
[04:29.69]I talked about the shitty town I lived in.
[04:33.11]Got it out of my... It might not be totally out of my system because you never know what happens with Jeremy's fucking internet.
[04:43.30]it's gonna be a long stream tonight no it's gonna be great I can't wait till you know I can't wait to look over and see like 5 000 drop frames oh it's gonna be the funniest no let's move on hey you know what I I share your comcast woes yes so uh it's really kind of just flipping a coin like heads or tails is it gonna be me or you
[05:03.23]Yeah, we'll find out.
[05:04.59]Or both.
[05:05.49]Hopefully not both.
[05:06.89]Hey, if I was living in Las Vegas, I would definitely say that those are the odds are in my favor.
[05:12.77]Anyways, let me just tweet.
[05:16.11]I'm just sitting here trying to be a fucking psychopath.
[05:19.46]I got the game open.
[05:20.44]Yeah, I do too.
[05:22.50]And I'm pretty hyped.
[05:27.28]Look, we've been looking forward to this for like a year and a half.
[05:28.86]Yeah.
[05:31.37]So I hope this is good.
[05:32.97]And I don't even know if my tweet's correct.
[05:34.95]This game was made for the two of us specifically.
[05:40.66]It definitely was.
[05:41.44]The main character, we actually did get flown out to Hazelight.
[05:47.28]And while we were there... Wait, what are you saying?
[05:51.05]Like at E3, remember like day three, E3 last year when we were talking to the Hazelight dev when he was talking to us about the Oscars and he wanted us to come be the game models for the two main characters.
[06:03.46]For a second I was trying to remember if what you're saying is real.
[06:06.92]No, it's a complete fabrication.
[06:08.66]Yeah, but in my brain I'm sitting here going, hold on, wait a minute, we did that?
[06:13.29]At E3 we did this shit?
[06:15.36]Well, my memory's terrible.
[06:16.20]It's true.
[06:16.86]Uh, by the way, internet, I can't tweet.
[06:19.80]Uh, it's not happening.
[06:21.16]So, uh, let's, it's law locked down.
[06:23.56]This is gonna go really well.
[06:25.16]Okay, are you ready?
[06:26.20]Are you ready?
[06:26.62]Let's start the game.
[06:27.18]I can't tweet.
[06:28.10]Can't fucking tweet.
[06:28.62]We do have a yellow connection bar right now, so that's good.
[06:31.02]That's good.
[06:31.50]As long as that stays that way, I'll be happy.
[06:33.76]Yeah, if this little bar turns orange.
[06:37.46]Then the stream is over now.
[06:39.22]It's pretty much over, yeah.
[06:40.14]All right, there we go.
[06:40.58]Let's pick, obviously, we're picking the guy that looks like me, and you're picking the guy that looks like you.
[06:43.95]Yeah, yeah.
[06:45.56]Yeah, I want to be the guy that I modeled for.
[06:47.71]Why don't we just do the opposite thing and I play you and you play me?
[06:52.69]Because then everyone will get confused.
[06:57.39]You know everyone watching is going to think that you're the guy that looks like you and I'm the guy that looks like me.
[07:03.38]So let's spin it around on him.
[07:04.36]What do you say?
[07:08.56]See, I might not be smart in your book, Italics, but I do get shit done.
[07:11.64]That's me.
[07:12.12]This sounds like you.
[07:15.23]Yeah, we kind of have to do it.
[07:16.91]He just sounds like you and looks like you.
[07:18.92]All right, so I got... I'm robbery, assault, grand theft, all things I probably have done.
[07:24.40]What about you?
[07:25.80]You've killed somebody.
[07:27.64]You've served six months out of eight years.
[07:30.76]So you've got it easy.
[07:32.08]Even though, how come, okay, time out.
[07:34.38]You're charged with armed robbery and assault.
[07:37.32]Oh, no, I'm charged with murder.
[07:38.46]Never mind.
[07:38.86]It's clear now.
[07:41.71]It's all clear to me now.
[07:42.85]I just saw fraud and embezzlement, and I was like, how's that 14 years and you've only got eight?
[07:47.13]Well, see, fraud, you're a liar.
[07:49.17]I guess I murdered somebody.
[07:50.85]I don't remember that.
[07:53.56]I mean, you are quite the liar with your E3 tail, you just told us.
[07:56.14]Okay, listen, look at your personality.
[07:57.64]Confident, short temper, joker.
[08:00.74]Joker?
[08:02.42]Yeah.
[08:02.92]Rational, disciplined, and reserved is mine.
[08:06.30]This is pretty good.
[08:08.49]What is that, like, that high school, like, what are you, like, an EDJQ?
[08:12.53]You know what I'm talking about?
[08:13.79]Like, what's the personality?
[08:15.91]Is this the personality test?
[08:17.21]ENFP.
[08:17.61]You know what I'm talking about, though, right?
[08:20.48]Yeah, I know.
[08:20.92]You talk about the personality type.
[08:22.34]I've done like three of those on stream.
[08:23.56]And I'm always like the... I'm always the elephant in the room.
[08:27.38]You know what I mean?
[08:28.68]I'm big.
[08:29.08]I'm boisterous.
[08:30.00]I always remember things.
[08:33.08]And I'm ready to play the game.
[08:34.74]Alright, let's go.
[08:35.48]I'm done.
[08:36.40]I'm like, I'm already... I'm trying so desperately.
[08:39.87]This is what's funny about this.
[08:41.99]I'm so angry right now.
[08:43.47]It's like my fuming body is trying to be like, you know, the elephant.
[08:46.89]I'm trying to be like a comedian.
[08:48.99]Half of my body wants to just throw a brick through my window right now.
[08:52.08]It'll be okay.
[08:52.90]It'll be okay.
[08:53.80]Okay.
[08:54.30]We're in the video game.
[08:55.32]You guys didn't even hear the meltdown while we and Italics were on a private call.
[09:00.66]Yeah, we started setting this up like two and a half hours ago.
[09:05.58]Just for reference.
[09:12.31]It was at least two and a half hours ago.
[09:14.51]All right.
[09:14.97]Welcome to the game.
[09:15.75]I'm going to... Everybody be quiet.
[09:18.41]And let's watch this funny prison game.
[09:25.09]Oh, Joseph farts.
[09:27.72]I've already got it in the back.
[09:28.74]I'm already good.
[09:31.16]Starting off with a fart joke?
[09:33.12]Yeah, that's actually pretty bad.
[09:33.96]You're right.
[09:39.53]I'm driving the bus right now, by the way.
[09:41.09]See, I told you we were going to get in a bus.
[09:43.39]And we were going to drive somewhere.
[09:46.99]I mean, we're clearly going to prison.
[09:50.35]Yeah, I would rather be in prison than live with this internet.
[09:54.50]So if I get on a bus and the bus driver's like, come on in, we're going to take you to a new house.
[09:58.58]And I'm like, really?
[09:59.32]Oh, perfect.
[09:59.88]This is exactly what I wanted.
[10:01.48]I don't even care if this is what it was.
[10:03.77]Does the internet work?
[10:10.18]That's you.
[10:11.88]That is me.
[10:12.66]This is my origin story.
[10:13.98]Okay, you're just passing through.
[10:15.78]I really do feel like that you have that shirt in your wardrobe.
[10:19.40]You think I have that Guy Fieri shirt in my wardrobe?
[10:21.29]I think I've actually seen you wear that shirt.
[10:23.99]With little flower petals on it?
[10:25.33]I mean, I would wear it if I had it.
[10:28.33]Yeah.
[10:34.86]So then where do I come in?
[10:35.96]What's my origin?
[10:38.40]I probably meet you in prison.
[10:41.19]You're probably already there.
[10:42.41]You've got like a gang.
[10:44.39]Yeah.
[10:44.49]I'm like the new guy on the block.
[10:47.05]Like, better watch out, bud.
[10:48.43]Keep your head low.
[10:49.75]Or else we're gonna come get you while you sleep.
[10:51.65]And here's the gimmick.
[10:55.14]So, I'm on the right screen.
[10:56.12]He's on the left.
[10:56.94]It's like this permanently for the rest of the game, right?
[10:58.96]Look at that beautiful face.
[11:01.04]Split screen in 2018.
[11:01.62]I mean, come on, man.
[11:03.66]Alright, you jog.
[11:06.94]I never left.
[11:08.50]I never left Boston.
[11:09.00]What are you supposed to be doing?
[11:11.33]I'm still just right there sitting next to him.
[11:13.53]Is there like a punch guy button?
[11:17.19]Okay, I can't go this way.
[11:18.73]I think I just stand over here.
[11:20.29]This is where we get searched or something?
[11:23.50]Are you going to watch me?
[11:24.58]Oh, I have to watch you.
[11:25.30]Wait, cancel.
[11:25.82]I want to watch you.
[11:26.36]Hang on.
[11:26.98]Where are you?
[11:28.64]Where are you?
[11:29.50]I think I'm already in prison.
[11:30.58]I am walking on in here.
[11:32.78]Can I see you?
[11:33.88]See, I'm already in prison.
[11:34.86]Everybody's cheering for me.
[11:35.94]I think I did something really good.
[11:39.16]These guys are super happy to see me.
[11:41.49]Well, I'm just going to do the thing that I'm supposed to do.
[11:44.99]I'll be over here.
[11:46.33]Okay.
[11:48.21]I'm going to go get my clothes.
[11:50.66]Oh, wait.
[11:50.90]I think I could have just watched you come in.
[11:53.64]I'm a little late.
[11:55.92]I'm just chatting up the inmates.
[11:59.82]I'm trying to get some allies right now, okay?
[12:01.92]Can you come back out here so I can see you?
[12:04.69]Can we do the thing where I see you?
[12:07.66]Why are they just sitting out here?
[12:09.80]I don't know.
[12:11.02]What do you know?
[12:11.86]I can leave.
[12:12.20]Oh, are you serious?
[12:13.08]I can just leave prison?
[12:14.04]What?
[12:14.20]I just got out!
[12:14.58]Nice.
[12:14.74]The fuck?
[12:15.10]Alright, you can't punch people.
[12:18.49]Hey, this is like watching 24.
[12:19.27]It really is.
[12:38.53]Like the new season.
[12:41.23]All right, so... Let me ask you this, though.
[12:43.51]What happens if I just don't go?
[12:45.59]What if you keep going in the game?
[12:46.87]Do I just stay in prison for the rest of the game?
[12:49.21]I mean, I assume there's a point at which you have to go to progress to the next scene.
[12:54.09]That'd be kind of funny if I just stayed there while you beat the whole game.
[12:57.68]You mean like it's one of those Far Cry situations where you literally lose in the first, like, ten minutes?
[13:01.68]Mm-hmm.
[13:01.96]Yeah.
[13:07.90]People fight in here every damn day.
[13:09.34]It's way too crazy in this joint.
[13:13.90]Uh, you're not on vacation.
[13:15.66]You're not on vacation.
[13:16.58]This is a fucking prison.
[13:18.24]This is a fucking prison.
[13:19.16]I don't want any trouble.
[13:20.19]Just leave me alone.
[13:21.17]Relax, I'm just trying to toughen you up.
[13:23.19]So we're gonna go to Pax dressed as DC, right?
[13:26.25]Wait, what?
[13:27.15]Like, this is our Halloween costume this year.
[13:29.13]Oh, yeah.
[13:29.81]No, definitely.
[13:30.45]I just need to get myself a leather jacket, a nice flower shirt.
[13:34.13]I just have to wear what I wear every day.
[13:36.65]Yeah, that just looks like what you wear by default.
[13:41.00]Alright, so I'm looking over here.
[13:45.61]I guess we can just go in here.
[13:47.13]Oh, no.
[13:47.43]I have to get dressed.
[13:49.55]Oh, no.
[13:51.33]Already?
[13:52.61]Whatever.
[13:52.93]You know what?
[13:53.89]I am ripped.
[13:55.31]I can handle it.
[13:57.47]I hope I can just sprint punch you wherever you are.
[13:59.19]That'd be so funny.
[14:00.57]All right.
[14:00.79]Get ready for the nudity filter.
[14:02.71]Is there a nudity filter?
[14:03.53]There might be.
[14:08.23]I wonder if I can just watch you walk by.
[14:10.82]I wonder if I can just watch you undress.
[14:13.14]Don't say that.
[14:13.84]No, don't start that.
[14:15.06]That's literally what's happening.
[14:16.16]You actually are.
[14:16.74]You're actually naked.
[14:17.62]Are we going to see you?
[14:18.36]I am actually naked right now.
[14:19.76]Is it full frontal in this game?
[14:20.94]I hope not.
[14:23.92]Oh, I'm getting hosed.
[14:26.68]I did not expect that.
[14:27.40]This does not feel pleasant.
[14:28.91]I thought it was going to come from the top.
[14:30.53]I thought the game broke.
[14:33.53]No.
[14:35.27]I'm clean, man.
[14:36.43]Isn't this enough?
[14:38.29]I thought that was going to come from the top, like you were going to the shower.
[14:40.73]Alright, well, do I have to do that too?
[14:43.59]Probably.
[14:44.43]No, you're new.
[14:45.19]You could be bringing in like a zombie disease.
[14:47.52]They got to make sure you're good to go.
[14:49.48]No, you're the new guy.
[14:51.50]That means you have to get cleaned.
[14:52.64]Uh-oh.
[14:54.58]Alright, QTEs, here we go.
[14:55.96]He's still just naked.
[15:04.61]Still just naked.
[15:05.91]I am still just naked, but I have a lot of other naked men with me now.
[15:09.95]So I feel a little bit more comfortable in my lineup.
[15:12.80]Which one is you?
[15:13.84]You're the voyeur.
[15:16.80]Look at this.
[15:17.28]Look at this immersion.
[15:18.90]Can I start, like, screaming?
[15:19.98]I think I'm in the middle.
[15:20.82]All right, look up.
[15:21.42]Can you see me?
[15:23.28]Oh, you're in a cutscene.
[15:26.51]That's cool.
[15:27.01]How do I drop, like, a big Skittle spit down here?
[15:36.18]He says that's cool though.
[15:37.02]Uh oh, he's about to give up.
[15:41.52]What's this guy doing?
[15:45.05]Yeah, you're interrupting my cutscene.
[15:47.57]Listen, some of us here are on the left.
[15:50.45]You don't look like it.
[15:51.99]Just talking over your big moment.
[15:57.77]Oh, we got orange.
[15:58.57]Run.
[15:59.37]Alright, you should be able to see me now.
[16:03.94]I'm currently talking to the guy.
[16:05.66]Alright, I'm up here.
[16:06.48]I'm gonna come find you.
[16:10.34]I'm in the line of naked men.
[16:12.03]See if you can figure out which one's me without screen looking.
[16:14.07]That's what I'm trying to do.
[16:14.79]Alright, I see you.
[16:15.47]Alright, you're...
[16:19.57]This is a spy party right here.
[16:22.13]I can't go this way.
[16:24.72]No, I can.
[16:25.38]No, I got my own cell.
[16:28.60]Oh, you got locked up.
[16:30.46]Put him in the brig.
[16:31.18]Whatever, I'm just gonna sit in the chair.
[16:32.12]The naked man run free now.
[16:33.78]We own this place.
[16:34.62]How are we supposed to get out of here?
[16:37.49]You're in a much better position than I am right now, let me tell you.
[16:39.89]Alright, this is how many days I've been in.
[16:41.57]I'm gonna mark another marker.
[16:43.09]Where do I go?
[16:45.41]I don't know.
[16:47.63]All I have to do is hold a pen.
[16:50.70]Write in your journal.
[16:51.66]That's what I'm doing.
[16:55.36]The split-screen redemption.
[16:57.04]I think I'm coming up to meet you.
[17:02.66]I'm probably your new cellmate.
[17:06.12]Are you?
[17:07.26]No, you're in a different cell.
[17:07.98]I think I'm right next to you, though.
[17:09.68]How do I rattle the bars?
[17:13.22]I need to be the guy that rattles the bars.
[17:14.68]Oh, wait, hey!
[17:17.82]Sorry, bud.
[17:18.72]Some things are more important.
[17:20.48]Like my dignity.
[17:21.96]Yeah, you're in 48.
[17:24.40]I'm in 49.
[17:26.02]We gotta dig a tunnel between the toilets.
[17:36.86]Evil Jupiter?
[17:37.66]Oh, I saw it.
[17:38.48]Alright, this is where we first meet each other.
[17:50.54]New guy coming up here.
[17:55.44]It's you.
[17:55.96]I told you, I'm the new guy.
[17:58.20]You're like the boss.
[17:59.36]So I get to be the crime boss?
[18:04.62]You're just like the prison gang leader.
[18:07.78]Look at me.
[18:08.46]Look how sad I look right now.
[18:09.98]Are we gonna play... I look so put together.
[18:12.58]I've got like a belt on.
[18:13.88]Are we gonna play R2-D2 here?
[18:15.48]R2.
[18:15.52]R2!
[18:21.58]Is there like a... Why isn't there a yell button?
[18:24.92]Why are you not playing R2-D2 with me?
[18:27.59]Who's winning?
[18:28.23]Me, of course.
[18:30.35]I mean, Marco Polo.
[18:33.49]Find nearby points of interest.
[18:35.57]Hey, hey, you calling me a cheater?
[18:37.35]What if I did?
[18:39.05]He's right.
[18:39.75]You are always winning.
[18:41.06]Are you cheating?
[18:42.08]Of course not.
[18:43.46]My conversation's more important.
[18:45.26]I might just do that.
[18:48.55]I can't wait to run into you.
[18:49.69]I'm just gonna bump shoulders.
[18:52.68]But that's it.
[18:53.06]I'm fine.
[18:53.36]I'm just gonna find you.
[18:54.58]Maybe you're right.
[18:55.88]But is this all the equipment you have?
[18:59.01]It's all the equipment you need.
[19:01.38]Yeah.
[19:02.16]Take a look at these biceps.
[19:05.02]Can you look up here?
[19:06.26]Take a look at my pecs.
[19:07.98]I can move them too.
[19:09.35]It's one to one?
[19:10.29]Holy shit.
[19:10.99]Alright, I'm coming to find you.
[19:14.31]You impressed yet?
[19:16.47]Maybe we fight.
[19:17.09]That would be so awesome if we actually fought each other.
[19:18.85]Oh, no.
[19:19.17]Wait.
[19:19.29]Help me.
[19:19.53]Come on.
[19:19.71]Help.
[19:19.91]Help.
[19:20.91]Smoker.
[19:22.49]Smoker.
[19:23.69]Look, we're role playing right now.
[19:26.16]I have some exercises to do.
[19:27.50]No.
[19:28.20]Get over here.
[19:29.44]No, I gotta buff.
[19:30.30]I gotta bulk up.
[19:30.82]I can see it from here.
[19:38.09]He might be on the outside, but he still pays me good, huh?
[19:41.81]Fact is, he pays me real good to kill you.
[19:44.97]And I don't really like you.
[19:46.59]So it's a win-win situation for me.
[19:47.91]Hey, maybe you shouldn't get in so much trouble.
[19:50.57]Look, our characters don't even know each other yet, Dermot.
[19:52.75]You need to investigate the commotion before he kills me.
[19:55.05]Look, it's okay.
[19:56.21]You'll be fine, I'm sure.
[19:57.16]I swear I'm gonna kill you.
[19:59.76]You know what?
[20:00.06]Just keep doing your thing.
[20:03.68]I'm gonna investigate secretly, though.
[20:08.49]They'll never know that I was here.
[20:09.93]Alright, what am I supposed to do for real?
[20:12.24]Uh, I think you're supposed to come up here, but I think he'll just keep beating me up.
[20:16.98]That's fine.
[20:17.74]That's fine.
[20:18.18]That gives me some free time to play the game on my own pace, you know what I mean?
[20:21.28]Probably some guy over here in the corner, he's got something important to say.
[20:24.12]Like, can we just go over the fact that... What's the deal with, like, two guys holding onto your arms?
[20:30.01]I can get out of that.
[20:31.01]You can get out of that.
[20:32.15]Just fucking start flailing around and kicking and screaming and ripping your arms around.
[20:35.83]Those guys are just placing their arms on me.
[20:37.99]Why?
[20:38.87]They overuse this too much.
[20:41.37]I'm just gonna leave you to your fate.
[20:48.82]He's just gonna keep doing it.
[20:50.16]Nah, it's never gonna stop.
[20:51.60]Okay, I thought that guy on your screen, I thought that guy was floating.
[20:59.75]Oh wait, I can look over there.
[21:02.09]I'm investigating the commotion.
[21:04.27]It's just a different, it's a different commotion.
[21:07.20]Go like I can do I can do first-person mode.
[21:08.78]Just checking the place out.
[21:10.28]Yeah, first day is gonna be your last day Let's just start walking Nice to meet you, too.
[21:16.25]I swear.
[21:16.93]I'm gonna kill you It's just gonna take me a really long time I just get like a good close look at it get up like zooming on my face There he is look there you are
[21:30.80]Get in line.
[21:31.70]This is the get in line to get beat up.
[21:33.26]This is the ride.
[21:33.88]No, this is the get in line to punch you.
[21:36.25]We're all waiting our turn.
[21:37.91]No, this is the amusement park ride.
[21:39.53]Line up to get beat up.
[21:43.39]Turn up the game.
[21:44.37]Get in there, new fish.
[21:45.71]Hey, what the hell?
[21:46.59]What are you doing?
[21:47.99]Go, dragon man.
[21:48.89]Kill him.
[21:50.06]Kill him.
[21:51.10]Take him down.
[21:53.36]Come on, motherfucker.
[21:54.34]Here we go.
[21:55.36]First action scene.
[21:55.98]Why did they go to me instead of you?
[22:00.18]I'm pressing those two.
[22:01.20]I think we both have to do it at the same time.
[22:03.18]Ready?
[22:03.52]One, two, three.
[22:05.48]Three.
[22:06.68]Three.
[22:09.88]You didn't get yours.
[22:11.50]Yeah, apparently not.
[22:17.43]Counter.
[22:18.39]That sounded like a bloody nose.
[22:20.75]It's like playing Dance Dance Revolution with a friend.
[22:24.97]It really is.
[22:25.45]I like how it goes to the other point of view to do the other QTs.
[22:30.95]It's not my favorite movie, Scott Pilgrim right now.
[22:33.60]So I'm back there.
[22:34.16]Do I have to do it too?
[22:36.74]We're both out.
[22:37.30]Here we go.
[22:37.66]My turn.
[22:38.88]No, you only do yours.
[22:39.87]I do mine.
[22:41.69]I knew you were going to do that too.
[22:43.67]Now we're going to do the whole thing over again.
[22:48.20]I knew you were gonna do that, too.
[22:51.42]It was so obvious.
[22:52.94]The first Jerma joke is always, I didn't push the QTE button in time.
[22:58.80]It's right here.
[22:59.74]Relax.
[23:04.95]I didn't do it in time.
[23:06.47]Isn't that funny?
[23:07.15]Hey, watch it, buddy.
[23:12.79]Why didn't you do it?
[23:13.51]Hey, you were just talking shit.
[23:14.71]Now...
[23:15.84]Yeah.
[23:16.46]How's it feel?
[23:17.34]Huh?
[23:17.72]Now you gotta wait for me.
[23:18.48]Are you serious?
[23:21.36]Plus, the roundhouse kick to the face was way funnier than your stupid little slide.
[23:25.64]I just got made fun of for the thing that I just did and then he just did it.
[23:28.86]Yeah.
[23:30.60]I thought you were gonna do it again.
[23:35.25]Don't do it again!
[23:36.13]Holy shit, I really thought you were doing it again.
[23:38.85]You're playing with fire here.
[23:48.07]I ain't fucking around anymore, I wanna get out of this.
[23:54.31]My turn.
[23:56.89]No.
[23:58.27]Nope, they're ninjas.
[23:59.19]Oh, here come the bobbies!
[24:01.15]Break it up before I put you on the loo!
[24:05.67]Get back to your shells!
[24:19.94]By the way, for those of us that were here yesterday, for yesterday's stream, same characters, same bloody nose.
[24:26.40]We're playing the exact same person.
[24:32.48]It's before he went to prison.
[24:34.20]Hey, stay away from me.
[24:45.51]I have a feeling that we're inseparable.
[24:49.87]Well, now we're gonna be best friends.
[24:50.99]Yeah.
[24:53.07]First time we heard a guy talk, I think, right?
[25:00.62]Uh... He talked at the very beginning of the game, right?
[25:04.26]Yeah.
[25:05.04]Like, before the prison bus?
[25:09.30]Maybe.
[25:13.55]Alright, so this is where we have to eat?
[25:15.57]No.
[25:19.00]I'm getting some middle school PTSD right now.
[25:23.69]I don't know where to sit.
[25:25.29]I don't know where to sit.
[25:28.69]Oh, no.
[25:29.41]On the left, you've got the kids playing Magic the Gathering.
[25:31.39]You don't want to sit on that table.
[25:33.21]On the right, you've got the jocks.
[25:34.11]You don't want to be associated with the jocks.
[25:36.13]The dweebs.
[25:38.26]The theater kids.
[25:40.58]be anyone but the theater kids don't fuck with me when I'm hungry okay they're really not gonna let me sit with him too sure looks like it all right what are you gonna do about it Ringo how about this all right shit man relax okay strong do you still looking around for a place to eat I'm still trying to find somewhere to sit there we go uh I was gonna just watch you I love the way he sits

[26:14.10]Why are you... Hey, listen, didn't you get enough of me?
[26:17.89]Full frontal yesterday, bud?
[26:19.63]Will you eat something?
[26:25.57]Nice.
[26:25.77]There.
[26:26.59]What else?
[26:27.85]What else do you want?
[26:28.57]Oh, I got a tray, too.
[26:30.07]Yeah.
[26:30.67]What do you think this is?
[26:31.81]A goddamn restaurant?
[26:32.97]Uh-oh.
[26:34.27]Watch out.
[26:34.70]He's coming for you.
[26:35.74]Oh, wait.
[26:36.20]You could have... Thanks for the warning, man.
[26:38.70]He's got a knife.
[26:39.14]Watch out.
[26:39.48]It's time to die.
[26:46.42]Thank you.
[26:48.02]Is that me?
[26:48.64]No, that was a different guy.
[26:52.70]You've got your own problems in the kitchen.
[26:54.51]Mine are outside.
[26:55.59]I thought I just spun around and punched you in the face.
[26:58.35]Here we go again.
[27:02.89]Oh, great.
[27:05.85]Here comes the first boss.
[27:07.01]Oh, God.
[27:07.25]Back away.
[27:18.16]Holy shit.
[27:19.56]That guy is cool.
[27:21.41]The people are coming from under the ground.
[27:23.31]We can throw material.
[27:25.47]We can throw material.
[27:26.23]Find some material to throw.
[27:29.97]I was very distracted.
[27:34.39]We can throw a trash barrel at him.
[27:37.59]Just get the strainer.
[27:39.51]I think I lost my...
[27:47.81]I didn't get to throw enough stuff though.
[27:51.15]That hurt so bad.
[27:53.39]Imagine getting a strainer off the center of your face.
[27:58.93]Why are there so many ways to kill someone else in this prison?
[28:03.52]Oh, do we play these guys?
[28:04.68]Is this the real way out?
[28:05.60]Is this the two characters play as?
[28:07.00]There's the quest.
[28:09.00]Holy shit!
[28:09.76]He's actually killing that guy.
[28:22.09]This is when prison guards stopped carrying batons and started carrying AR-15s.
[28:26.59]Can we go back to being able to throw stuff at people's faces?
[28:29.67]That was fun.
[28:31.47]I liked that.
[28:36.44]Syringe.
[28:36.76]Don't do it.
[28:37.60]Don't do it.
[28:37.96]Oh.
[28:53.64]At least you won't get the flu now.
[29:03.09]Well, what would you be getting a shot for, though?
[29:05.39]Tetanus?
[29:06.19]Something like that, probably.
[29:09.73]From, like, fighting with all those dirty kitchen utensils?
[29:13.17]Probably, yeah.
[29:14.01]I mean, that was just zooming in on that.
[29:16.61]Is this where I kill you?
[29:17.59]Hey.
[29:19.25]You gonna murder me in my sleep?
[29:20.75]I'm the murderer, remember?
[29:23.07]Thank you, Never Trust a Purple, for the ten bucks.
[29:25.17]Thank you, dude.
[29:26.65]Came in here right now.
[29:27.33]George Washington goes to prison.
[29:30.13]Thanks a lot, dude.
[29:30.66]Oh, we got some time.
[29:32.68]I like how well tucked in you are.
[29:35.28]I like the guy in the background patting the coffee maker.
[29:48.09]I like how you're under a McDonald's heat lamp, by the way.
[29:50.35]That's how they keep it fresh and ready.
[29:54.05]There's little Caesars right there.
[29:55.62]What?
[29:55.84]Of course I can.
[29:57.16]That's the name of the game.
[29:57.94]You're gonna have to wheel me around, man.
[30:02.02]Okay.
[30:15.85]Keep your eyes sharp.
[30:17.68]Why can't I be the guy that lies in bed?
[30:20.98]I have to go do the puzzle?
[30:21.78]I'm gonna push that big yellow button if you offend me.
[30:26.50]So what is this?
[30:27.06]Do I have to get up?
[30:28.68]Okay, I'll distract the nurse.
[30:30.20]Just watch out for her.
[30:31.05]Retrieve the tool, okay.
[30:32.63]Wait, you gotta wait.
[30:33.61]I gotta distract the nurse first, okay?
[30:35.87]I actually am hitting the big yellow button.
[30:37.69]Oh, you are hitting the button.
[30:39.01]So I have to retrieve the tool.
[30:41.17]Yeah, wait for her to get distracted.
[30:44.45]No, she's not...
[30:47.58]You look so suspicious.
[30:48.86]No, I'm back in bed.
[30:50.06]Like, as soon as you get up, you take this crouching posture.
[30:52.86]I had a leg cramp.
[30:57.61]Alright, so now, like, hitman style, I gotta, like, knock her out, right?
[31:00.69]Yeah, go knock her out.
[31:04.03]What is this?
[31:04.73]Did I just growl at her?
[31:06.25]Okay.
[31:10.39]She had a tingling sensation.
[31:12.10]The hairs on the back of her neck stood up, and she knew you were there.
[31:14.80]I just growled at her.
[31:15.78]All right.
[31:16.04]No, you can't get... I got it.
[31:17.44]He's going to get the tool.
[31:18.36]Just watch out for her.
[31:23.48]Excuse me, nurse.
[31:24.26]So where's the tool?
[31:27.51]Leo's freaking me out in here.
[31:29.97]Wait till she goes... Tell her you got a stomachache.
[31:32.27]I mean, it's got to be outside this room.
[31:36.41]Yeah, I'm going for it.
[31:36.97]What can I do for you?
[31:39.62]Hide.
[31:40.24]Wait.
[31:40.56]What?
[31:41.68]Hold on.
[31:42.14]No, no, no.
[31:43.38]Hide behind the door right now.
[31:45.98]I'm making this so hard for myself.
[31:47.94]What if she's coming back?
[31:49.32]Alright, she's at the sink.
[31:50.16]She's at the sink.
[31:51.44]You got time.
[31:52.34]She's just looking at me funny.
[31:54.82]Alright, do you tell me where she's going?
[31:56.26]You've got a limited amount of time right now.
[31:57.88]She's coming back to my water.
[32:02.76]I think I'm fine here.
[32:03.56]How do I distract her?
[32:05.04]How do I get this guy to move?
[32:09.14]She's gonna be like, Johnny, I need some coffee!
[32:10.53]Listen, I got nothing.
[32:11.53]That was my only go-to was, can I have some water, alright?
[32:13.99]It's all I got.
[32:14.73]Okay.
[32:15.27]Wait, was the tool over here?
[32:17.59]How did you end up working in a prison?
[32:19.15]No.
[32:19.63]I've lived nearby my whole life, so it just kind of made sense.
[32:22.65]Alright, back to work.
[32:23.33]This guy's gonna leave.
[32:23.94]Alright, you're gonna have to shit your pants.
[32:27.86]You're gonna have to take one to the team.
[32:30.30]Oopsie!
[32:30.64]Just press it.
[32:31.28]Even if you don't have to go to the bathroom, press as hard as you can in your pants right now.
[32:34.50]It could happen.
[32:34.88]You could do it, right?
[32:36.69]Look, I already broke my glass.
[32:37.77]What else do you want?
[32:38.32]Gotta get the tool.
[32:42.54]Oh, shit.
[32:44.08]I see you.
[32:46.48]Just find the tool, man.
[32:47.59]There's a guy right here.
[32:50.63]Oh, my God.
[32:52.57]What the fuck?
[32:53.37]What?
[32:53.57]Wow.
[33:01.93]So we're supposed to be escaping prison today.
[33:05.05]Step one.
[33:06.03]Step one.
[33:08.84]Let's go the other way.
[33:11.80]Do you know when I'm getting out of here?
[33:15.36]Is that why you called me over?
[33:16.48]It's on her stand?
[33:17.54]Yeah, sorry.
[33:19.34]It wouldn't be marked on the map.
[33:22.96]I don't know.
[33:23.28]I don't see a tool over here.
[33:24.02]It's not up to me, but I'm sure it won't be too long.
[33:25.80]She was standing over here.
[33:28.34]Hi.
[33:28.46]She's about to turn around in a second.
[33:30.02]She's turning around right now.
[33:31.02]Yeah, I'm going to wait.
[33:34.33]I think she's going to get me water even though I don't want any right now.
[33:36.81]Do you see a tool?
[33:38.15]I'm just getting restless here.
[33:40.23]Do I see a tool?
[33:41.21]Isn't that your job?
[33:42.31]Yeah, but I mean, what tool?
[33:43.61]Alright, she coming back?
[33:46.27]Tell me when she's turning.
[33:47.53]She's scrubbing the sink right now.
[33:49.23]You gotta tell me when she spins around.
[33:51.31]How did you end up working in a prison?
[33:53.33]I've lived nearby my whole life, so it just kind of made sense.
[33:59.72]I can't see you through the blinds, surely.
[34:01.32]Can't you go crouch up against the wall right there?
[34:04.02]I'm afraid to.
[34:04.70]You look a bit pale.
[34:05.74]Is something wrong?
[34:07.10]He stands up.
[34:08.08]I'm fine.
[34:08.66]Let's see what happens if I do this.
[34:09.60]Because, see, I'm going to stand up here.
[34:11.86]No, I'm okay.
[34:12.32]All right.
[34:13.69]So what about this guy?
[34:15.85]Well, I didn't get water this time because I wanted to see what would happen.
[34:19.09]And it was a bad move.
[34:21.13]There's a bunch of people in here.
[34:22.31]What am I supposed to do?
[34:23.05]They're the tool men.
[34:23.87]You've got to go steal their tool.
[34:25.15]Steal the tool from the guy that's at his desk.
[34:27.73]Is there a broom closet I can hide in right here?
[34:33.82]Channel your hitman, man.
[34:35.32]Come on.
[34:35.56]Okay, there we go.
[34:36.13]Oh, do I?
[34:36.59]Yeah, I guess you have to do something.
[34:39.03]Do I have to do everything?
[34:40.47]You have to.
[34:40.95]I'm telling you, just squeeze as hard as you can.
[34:42.71]I'm in a bed.
[34:44.35]Even if it hurts your bladder and shit, just piss.
[34:46.09]It's hot.
[34:48.09]Oh, God.
[34:48.51]Wait.
[34:48.75]Look what you made me do.
[34:49.91]I got him.
[34:50.31]He's distracted.
[34:50.89]He's very distracted.
[34:52.76]Steel tool.
[34:53.88]Right there.
[34:54.28]You got it.
[34:55.12]Give it to me.
[34:55.58]Got it.
[34:56.78]Oh, shit.
[34:57.24]Oh, my God.
[34:57.76]Okay, I'm fine.
[34:58.52]Captain is going to kill me.
[35:02.40]Do it again.
[35:03.38]Turn around and scream.
[35:06.22]Oh, there you go.
[35:07.04]I gotta go to the bathroom.
[35:08.41]I gotta get back to bed.
[35:10.83]Whoa, she's gonna see me!
[35:13.15]Don't tell her to leave!
[35:28.36]in bed.
[35:28.98]Yeah, well, I mean, she's staring at the window that I'm about to walk by.
[35:32.14]Uh, we're gonna go with, like, that was disgusting.
[35:36.94]Alright, I'm fine.
[35:37.92]Alright, wait till she turns around.
[35:40.38]Which way is she going?
[35:41.40]She's going back to the sink.
[35:43.76]I'm just gonna get in here.
[35:44.98]I can't.
[35:45.82]Alright, she's at the sink.
[35:46.94]You should be clean.
[35:49.52]I'm clean.
[36:00.38]careful this is fine easy does it all right go how long is she gonna be please don't stand up I think she's okay for now you got a minute okay go go get in my bed get in my bed is this my bed I think so all right good we did it yeah what are we even getting that tool for I think I'm gonna like bust the lock tonight maybe
[36:29.66]What are we breaking?
[36:30.64]No, I'm gonna use this as a prison shank.
[36:36.24]Oh yeah, you're gonna kill that other guy.
[36:37.84]I'm gonna stab that guy right in his chest.
[36:44.33]I'm hiding that, I guess, for later.
[36:46.71]Tomorrow, when I wake up.
[36:55.77]I probably just have to get some tools together before we can, you know.
[37:00.86]We just put a bunch of shit out there.
[37:02.78]Gotta be some preparation before we make the escape.
[37:05.46]It's a file?
[37:05.98]Yeah, you can hurt somebody with a file.
[37:10.90]Yeah, all you gotta do is, like, sharpen it up a little bit.
[37:16.47]Look, if you can cut a piece of bread with it, you can hurt somebody.
[37:21.73]What you writing?
[37:25.43]We're really into tiny lists these days.
[37:30.37]Can't you kill someone with a pencil, too?
[37:32.97]Maybe.
[37:34.05]Depends.
[37:34.35]Didn't the Joker do it in that one movie?
[37:42.72]I don't know what movie.
[37:45.84]You can cut a piece of bread with your fists.
[37:47.06]Yeah, that's why they're deadly.
[37:54.26]Drop some wisdom on me.
[37:55.02]I appreciate what you did back there.
[37:56.17]So I wonder if we can have dialogue options for each other.
[37:59.47]Hey.
[38:00.43]What?
[38:01.15]I'm sure you have good reasons to bust out of here.
[38:02.83]Like I pick something and you pick something.
[38:03.97]But I need to get out of here too.
[38:05.55]Yeah?
[38:05.71]But do we see what the options are for the other person or not?
[38:07.81]No, that would be fun.
[38:08.45]Just offering my help here.
[38:09.31]Hey, you know what?
[38:09.87]I don't need your help.
[38:10.47]We can just stop talking and we can just do dialogue choices.
[38:12.17]Yeah?
[38:13.03]Like you did in the infirmary back there?
[38:16.53]You trying to be funny?
[38:18.48]No, I'm not.
[38:20.29]I have a guess about the game.
[38:21.53]I'm pretty much in on this.
[38:23.09]I'm just trying to make you understand that you could really use my help.
[38:26.57]Like I said, I can handle myself.
[38:31.31]What about Harvey Dent?
[38:33.51]What about Harvey Dent?
[38:34.79]I knew you were going to say that.
[38:35.61]I was going to say it, but I didn't.
[38:38.57]What the fuck do you know about Harvey?
[38:40.09]Who have you been talking to?
[38:41.75]The walls are thin in here.
[38:42.87]Am I supposed to believe that?
[38:45.01]Let's just say that you and me have something in common.
[38:47.50]We both want him dead.
[38:50.52]We both want him dead.
[38:55.82]You don't know shit about me, man?
[38:58.28]Maybe not.
[38:59.90]But Harvey killed someone very close to me.
[39:01.33]Have we been introduced to Harvey yet or no?
[39:03.89]With or without you, I'm going after him.
[39:08.07]But I'm pretty damn sure our chances would be a lot better if we weren't together.
[39:12.51]And you know that.
[39:14.05]I like his, uh, typical cigarette voice.
[39:19.83]I got, like, the, eh, oh, come on, eh, come on, buddy.
[39:21.71]And then you have, like, the, ah, you look like the, eh, come on, buddy.
[39:25.07]Yeah, but then, but you also have the, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[39:29.76]Well, uh, my guy is 0-3-4-6-5, after all.
[39:35.82]40, he's over 40 years old.
[39:37.38]I think that's how everyone over 40 sounds.
[39:39.65]Have you ever smoked a cigarette, Italics?
[39:41.41]I have not.
[39:42.51]Oh, it's gross.
[39:46.99]That's it, that's all there is.
[39:48.49]Is he a pug?
[39:52.98]Yeah, a pug.
[40:02.62]God, if I was in prison right now, I would just be banging on the walls and making a bunch of noise going like, hello!
[40:07.00]You would be in solitary in record time.
[40:09.99]I would just be screaming right now, just like running my fingers back and forth.
[40:17.69]Wake up!
[40:19.51]Anybody want to hear some tunes?
[40:23.98]I would get killed.
[40:26.76]Your character looks like Ryan Gosling and Sylvester Stallone had a baby.
[40:34.24]I would do my absolute best Rip Taylor impression in prison.
[40:41.87]I love Rip Taylor.
[40:43.72]Who doesn't love Rip Taylor?
[40:56.31]Got the title card, title drop.
[40:57.70]Oh, this is back when we were together.
[40:59.38]Wait, what is this?
[41:00.30]Uh, this is, uh... Why are we... We're flashing forward.
[41:04.96]I thought this was just, like, the next day.
[41:07.26]This is once we escaped.
[41:08.94]Yeah, don't you know that all your tax dollars go to doing large plane helicopter tours for the inmates?
[41:15.33]This is a field trip.
[41:16.75]Twice.
[41:23.23]I don't know about that saving my ass part, but I'll give you this.
[41:26.99]It did help out.
[41:28.97]A little bit.
[41:31.69]Vincent, a little bit.
[41:34.32]Yeah, they got out at the end.
[41:37.90]Go push the buttons.
[41:39.52]So the whole game is a flap.
[41:40.38]So we didn't have any marks on us or anything.
[41:41.62]That means we got out completely totally fine.
[41:43.87]Yeah, your nose is, like, still looking good.
[41:46.25]I mean, I was assuming maybe, like, your arm was going to be gone.
[41:48.50]Or, like, I was going to have, like, a busted-up face.
[41:50.16]We got out with no problem at all.
[41:51.66]We're just going to probably walk out the front door in the end.
[41:54.12]I mean, that's probably, like, the first half.
[41:57.16]And then we're going to pick back up, and you're going to think, oh, we did it!
[42:00.29]And we're going to be back in the plane, and it's going to be like...
[42:03.33]Something, there's an SOS that goes out.
[42:05.13]Like, we're gonna hit a bird in the engine and crash.
[42:09.69]Guaranteed.
[42:10.25]Yeah, that's true.
[42:10.65]That's gonna happen halfway through the game.
[42:12.67]They're gonna pull a J.J.
[42:15.21]Abrams on us.
[42:17.76]We gotta go back to the island.
[42:19.60]Do we have to break into prison?
[42:23.18]Prison Break Season 2.
[42:25.60]How do you make a show called Prison Break and the guy gets out of prison in the first season and you continue to call the show Prison Break in Season 2?
[42:31.78]They did, for like five seasons, didn't they?
[42:33.76]Yeah, it should be Prison Break, and then the next season should be I Got Out.
[42:38.20]Colon, a Prison Break story, right?
[42:42.01]But yeah, you would title the sequel Prison Break In.
[42:46.29]No, you would title the sequel... Well, you have to keep the continuity there.
[42:51.20]Hey, Fred.
[42:51.42]What's up?
[42:52.76]Oh, good.
[42:53.66]What do you want?
[42:54.57]Are we bribing somebody here?
[42:55.25]Looks like a train conductor.
[42:56.75]I see a foldable chair there.
[42:58.85]WWF style would tell me.
[42:59.87]I think so.
[43:13.38]Keep an eye on that chair, though, Talcs.
[43:14.96]That's gonna be used.
[43:16.04]The chair?
[43:16.40]The chair in the background.
[43:19.10]Holding chair.
[43:20.52]Oh.
[43:20.96]Promise that goes into somebody's head in about ten minutes.
[43:24.48]Okay.
[43:27.00]Well, before we can do that, we have to prove our value.
[43:31.42]I'm going right to Forest Whitaker.
[43:32.76]I'm gonna hit it right in his face.
[43:33.90]Hang on, I'm gonna talk to Forest.
[43:35.98]God damn it.
[43:37.10]I can't pick up the chair.
[43:37.98]Never mind.
[43:38.30]Plan aborted.
[43:38.60]Well, it depends on what you want.
[43:44.14]Looks like hard work up here.
[43:45.64]What do we want?
[43:46.14]Do we want a record player or a way out of here?
[43:49.00]Yeah, are we going to share beers with these guys?
[43:51.66]What are you talking about?
[43:52.96]We want a way out of here.
[43:54.65]Do we?
[43:54.93]Yeah.
[43:55.27]Oh, no.
[43:55.83]We've got to get the chisel.
[43:57.77]Boy, I can't hear either one of these conversations.
[44:01.43]Where's the chisel?
[44:02.23]I think you'll find a way to get his attention somehow.
[44:15.52]All right, we're getting a record player.
[44:16.58]Forget getting out.
[44:17.30]Dude, look, I'll mop for a little bit.
[44:19.99]Look, let's just live like... What's that like... I did not do a very good job mopping.
[44:28.71]Oh, come on.
[44:30.98]Oh, you mean like doing the thing that you had an intuition?
[44:35.96]And breaking that shit?
[44:38.07]I'll do the job okay I'll clean up the dirty work all right now spin it around katana style and hit him the side of the head oh wait I gotta go this way to you come on lee I don't have all day sure it's almost clean where is that thing anyway the guard next to you while you plot your escape now the hell you're gonna get up there

[45:29.16]How come yours broke, but mine didn't?
[45:30.65]I don't know.
[45:31.13]I think we might have to clean this.
[45:34.25]I cleaned a lot already.
[45:35.89]Um, well... Just carrying around a stick.
[45:41.73]We need a distraction.
[45:46.71]Can you make a distraction for me while I walk around with a stick?
[45:53.53]You look lost.
[45:54.77]I don't know what to do with my stick broke.
[46:01.37]I'm not even cleaning, I'm just walking around like a child.
[46:04.33]Alright, so what am I... I'm supposed to get a chisel.
[46:06.91]I think we need to work together somehow.
[46:08.29]Okay, hold on.
[46:08.83]I gotta talk to this guy.
[46:09.97]I might be able to be the distraction here, so... Okay, here we go.
[46:11.69]Uh... Oh, you're getting caught!
[46:12.37]Alright, you gotta go talk to the guard.
[46:23.28]This guy over here.
[46:24.88]I'm not gonna move.
[46:25.62]You just come over here and you tell him something.
[46:28.18]Then I'm gonna do... I'm gonna do like a Tomb Raider jump up here and pull myself up.
[46:32.41]Alright, I'll be there in a second.
[46:35.83]I'm just antagonizing all the people doing actual prison work.
[46:39.81]Alright, so this guy here, you should be able to talk to him.
[46:44.61]And then I'm gonna do the... Pull.
[46:48.96]How are you gonna do that with a straight stick?
[46:53.15]Can you go over there and do that?
[46:55.17]You go over there to the board.
[46:56.81]Okay, I can distract him.
[46:57.83]So here we go.
[46:58.11]I'm going to be the distraction.
[46:59.57]Yeah.
[47:01.33]Good job.
[47:02.39]Good job.
[47:03.13]I'll wait here.
[47:06.77]Look, there's no chairs around here except for that one folding chair.
[47:10.43]So I got to make do, okay?
[47:12.17]Why wouldn't we just take the folding chair and unfold it here?
[47:16.13]I'm tired, all right?
[47:17.19]I've been in a lot of room sweeping earlier.
[47:19.11]Wait, why are we switching?
[47:20.13]Why are we switching?
[47:24.31]That didn't make any sense.
[47:25.73]Whatever, you're up there.
[47:27.53]All right, wait, wait, wait.
[47:28.81]Because you're the one that had the broken broom.
[47:31.21]Oh, that's right.
[47:31.77]I got you a new broom.
[47:32.83]Come here.
[47:34.53]If you had been gone, that would have been very strange.
[47:36.63]Now get back to work.
[47:37.69]Yeah, yeah.
[47:38.03]All right, got a new broom.
[47:41.10]Just be careful.
[47:41.72]He's back at the door.
[47:43.14]Plus, you got to do the sneaky scene last time.
[47:45.10]Yeah, it's your turn to do a sneaky scene.
[47:47.36]So maybe I can talk this guy up.
[47:49.22]Hey, remember that chisel we've seen four times?
[47:51.78]Oh, right, right.
[47:52.46]There it is.
[47:52.86]Okay.
[47:54.49]Ah, goddammit.
[47:56.03]Time to head back.
[47:56.77]Did you say goddammit?
[47:58.89]Oh, goddammit.
[48:00.09]Is it safe?
[48:00.53]That guy's looking this way.
[48:01.81]Um, maybe I can... I'm assuming he has no peripheral vision.
[48:05.98]Uh, he probably sits back down in the chair or something.
[48:07.90]Wait, can you come down another way?
[48:10.28]What the hell was that?
[48:11.30]I'm on my way.
[48:14.16]Wait, no, no.
[48:14.90]I think you can hand it to me.
[48:15.72]Uh-oh.
[48:16.64]We got something else going on.
[48:18.31]Guard's looking this way.
[48:19.35]I got it.
[48:19.83]I'll handle it.
[48:21.03]Leo, distract him, goddammit.
[48:23.74]Come on, Leo.
[48:24.28]I don't know how to distract him.
[48:28.82]Should I start... Oh, here we go.
[48:33.46]Should I go across this thing?
[48:35.90]I don't know.
[48:36.24]Not yet.
[48:36.60]Hold on.
[48:39.33]You got this.
[48:39.81]I believe in you, baby.
[48:42.03]Here we go.
[48:43.23]Okay, okay.
[48:44.99]There it is.
[48:46.57]This uniform is making me sweat like a pig.
[48:50.19]All right, now, I can't believe it.
[48:52.45]It actually is.
[48:53.15]It actually is Shawshank Redemption.
[48:55.59]It has to be what they were going for here.
[48:58.47]Where are you going?
[48:59.59]I'm leaving.
[48:59.97]I'm breaking out on my own.
[49:12.21]All right, you have to find a way out.
[49:15.55]Oh.
[49:15.77]And I mean that in the... Wait, some kind of suicide squad?
[49:18.92]There you are.
[49:21.08]What are we?
[49:21.48]We've got a suicide squad.
[49:24.30]Oh, you forgot to do.
[49:24.96]Ah.
[49:25.90]Ah.
[49:26.94]Ah.
[49:28.52]Ah.
[49:29.10]The best Joker laugh we've ever heard.
[49:32.33]Hey.
[49:33.09]Oh, you think you can mess with the Joker?
[49:36.05]Ah.
[49:37.73]Ah.
[49:38.63]Ah.
[49:39.87]Ah.
[49:41.73]Ah.
[49:42.61]Best Joker laugh we've ever seen.
[49:43.97]I can open this.
[49:46.57]I got it.
[49:47.07]I think you can get out of here now, yeah?
[49:55.15]Got it.
[49:55.99]It's just Squidward's laugh.
[49:58.25]It is.
[49:58.63]Have you ever seen Suicide Squad?
[50:00.18]That's what he does.
[50:00.90]Suicide.
[50:01.64]Suicide Squad.
[50:05.08]That is his laugh.
[50:06.16]Watch that movie and tell me that's not exactly what he does.
[50:16.77]So, do I get to stab somebody with it or do you?
[50:18.89]I don't know.
[50:22.18]because I want to.
[50:23.94]I'm the murderer.
[50:25.24]Why would I want to watch that movie?
[50:26.78]So I watched it for you and I just did the best impression of the Joker from that movie you'll ever see.
[50:35.52]Oh shit, I don't know how to read.
[50:41.71]Ooh, wait a minute.
[50:45.57]This is when we break out?
[50:48.81]Don't make too much noise now.
[50:55.02]So now, I got the chisel.
[50:58.08]I gotta keep lookout.
[51:00.65]How?
[51:01.25]What?
[51:02.49]What am I doing?
[51:03.03]All right, you're gonna be making a lot of noise.
[51:04.91]We got a guard coming up.
[51:06.01]Wait, a guard coming right now?
[51:06.69]He's walking down the path.
[51:07.91]He's coming right now.
[51:09.09]Cancel, cancel, cancel.
[51:09.99]Oh, shit.
[51:10.31]He's coming right now.
[51:13.50]Hey, bud, what's happening today?
[51:15.92]Like you could move the toilet that quickly.
[51:17.63]What?
[51:19.01]Should I go lie in bed for a minute?
[51:20.67]Can I?
[51:21.67]Just keep it going.
[51:22.15]No, it's not going to happen.
[51:27.65]Okay, well, that didn't work.
[51:28.55]Get him again!
[51:29.33]Get him again!
[51:30.05]Scream at him!
[51:30.99]I'm done.
[51:31.67]What are you doing up this late?
[51:34.99]Stop busting my balls, man.
[51:36.25]I'm not doing anything.
[51:37.43]Anybody else coming?
[51:38.58]Yep.
[51:38.96]There's like four guards.
[51:40.18]Four guards.
[51:40.98]All right.
[51:41.42]Well, there's one, two on patrol right now.
[51:44.24]Okay.
[51:44.54]Tell me when I got a moment.
[51:45.56]They're both really suspicious of you.
[51:49.28]Why?
[51:50.10]This is how I pee.
[51:51.20]I pull my dick to the left and pee that way.
[51:53.88]I make a 90 degree angle with my penis and it goes in.
[51:58.08]Alright, I think I'm good.
[52:00.23]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[52:03.25]Alright.
[52:04.11]You got a clear shot.
[52:05.75]This is your only chance right now.
[52:11.73]Got it.
[52:12.46]100% clear.
[52:13.34]Good.
[52:15.84]Alright.
[52:16.70]Lefty loosey.
[52:19.99]Just, you know.
[52:21.85]Got it.
[52:22.43]Is it coming?
[52:24.47]Nobody's coming.
[52:25.19]What am I doing in here?
[52:27.33]Oh, my God.
[52:27.93]I got this.
[52:29.27]We got another guard about 15 meters out.
[52:33.00]He's incoming.
[52:35.70]You got time.
[52:36.16]You got a little time.
[52:36.84]You don't have to panic.
[52:39.90]They don't like me very much.
[52:40.88]Uh-oh.
[52:42.16]Take two.
[52:43.21]Distract.
[52:43.85]Listen.
[52:49.09]Is tomorrow visiting day?
[52:50.93]No.
[52:51.66]You sure?
[52:52.98]Yeah.
[52:53.44]Go to sleep.
[52:54.84]Oh, whoa.
[52:55.18]Here he comes.
[52:56.42]Here he comes.
[52:59.76]Go to bed, inmate.
[53:01.66]Go to bed.
[53:02.84]Look, it's not even lights out yet.
[53:05.68]My light is still on.
[53:06.79]I can't sleep.
[53:07.37]I just have to stare at the toilet.
[53:08.47]Am I clear?
[53:10.45]You're clear.
[53:11.13]Yeah.
[53:11.25]Are you sure?
[53:12.15]We're about to have another guard here in a minute, so make it count.
[53:20.33]I was made for this.
[53:28.47]It's not over.
[53:29.17]I don't have much stamina.
[53:33.95]What is on the other side of this?
[53:35.25]I don't know.
[53:35.99]Something behind you.
[53:37.58]Oh, I have to do my own cell now.
[53:39.52]I gotta give the chisel to you.
[53:40.99]How?
[53:41.61]Oh, here comes the guard.
[53:42.45]Not now.
[53:43.71]Just toss it over there.
[53:46.69]Okay, this is like the third encounter I've had with this game.
[53:49.99]Oh, shit!
[53:50.63]Okay, I thought I just accidentally did it.
[53:54.11]I can't sleep.
[53:54.75]Do you have a book I can read?
[53:56.49]What do I look like, a librarian?
[53:58.03]Go to sleep.
[53:58.88]Well, the last guy that came through gave us a book.
[54:02.47]Like, if you stand, like, right here.
[54:06.55]Hmm, I wonder what the fuck these two are doing.
[54:13.13]Hey, can you pass me that thing?
[54:18.26]Come on.
[54:19.18]Just hand it over, man.
[54:20.10]What are you waiting for?
[54:21.18]Oh, I love it.
[54:21.74]I need some teamwork opportunity right now.
[54:28.11]Don't mind me.
[54:29.31]Alright, yeah.
[54:30.11]I'm on it.
[54:30.69]Come on.
[54:32.97]How would you not fucking see that?
[54:35.23]Alright, you gotta keep a lookout.
[54:38.92]Keep a lookout.
[54:39.76]I can't.
[54:40.24]Alright, I'm looking.
[54:42.40]We got a, uh... That's so funny.
[54:48.44]You're good for a little while.
[54:49.34]So how do you move it back when you need to... Circle.
[54:54.47]Just hit cancel.
[54:59.38]Uh, you got a guy coming down here?
[55:01.06]I would stop.
[55:02.44]Stop.
[55:04.04]Stop.
[55:04.36]Hit cancel now.
[55:05.20]Hit cancel.
[55:06.08]He's going through the metal detector right now.
[55:07.44]Okay, that's the noise I'm going to make when he goes through the metal detector, okay?
[55:10.76]Bingo.
[55:11.32]That's a bingo.
[55:12.84]You're fine.
[55:13.90]So anytime the guy... You see to the right here on my screen?
[55:17.14]See the metal detector?
[55:18.38]Yes, officer.
[55:19.24]When he goes through there, I'm going to go... And that means that he's on his way, okay?
[55:22.60]Okay.
[55:25.11]Which way does he go?
[55:25.95]He goes back this way?
[55:26.79]He's going to go back this way.
[55:27.65]Okay.
[55:28.83]Deep breath.
[55:34.43]Wait, what?
[55:35.13]He went through.
[55:35.53]I thought that was a warning.
[55:38.24]I have to keep it continuity, man.
[55:40.86]Every time he goes through.
[55:42.14]Every time he goes through.
[55:43.14]Oh, no.
[55:51.02]You good?
[55:56.17]Not again.
[55:56.63]You okay?
[55:59.19]Hold on.
[56:08.04]Why am I... You can just look on my screen.
[56:10.32]Why am I doing that?
[56:11.26]I know, but, like, you gotta... You gotta...
[56:19.07]We're just standing at the gate every single time.
[56:22.47]This is very suspicious.
[56:23.57]I would investigate.
[56:24.07]And every single time, he says, go to bed, and we just keep standing here.
[56:27.43]Okay, you're good.
[56:30.22]Yeah, you're good.
[56:31.54]The guy on the right hasn't come down here one time.
[56:37.62]All right, tap it out.
[56:40.90]You're good.
[56:41.98]No one even coming.
[56:44.94]That guard just stays still.
[56:48.17]You got time.
[56:49.71]I guess breaking out of prison has got to have a little effort.
[56:52.07]There you go.
[56:54.07]Alright.
[56:56.33]We can't escape now.
[56:57.19]It's too obvious.
[56:58.71]Well, no.
[57:01.66]I got an idea.
[57:02.92]Let's change our clothes with the toilets.
[57:05.06]So then they'll think that the toilet's never left.
[57:07.72]You know what I mean?
[57:08.28]We'll put the toilet clothes on and leave.
[57:10.16]And they'll have our clothes on.
[57:11.43]And they'll have our clothes on.
[57:12.67]So then they won't know.
[57:15.48]Let's change costumes with the toilet.
[57:18.52]Mm-hmm.
[57:19.16]Right.
[57:21.58]No, it's way smoother to, like, stuff something under your bed.
[57:26.56]Yeah.
[57:27.54]Under the sheets.
[57:29.98]Are we just going to go on the count of three?
[57:32.41]What are we doing?
[57:32.83]I guess so.
[57:33.31]Am I opening the... Oh, no.
[57:35.15]No, you're checking.
[57:36.83]Because there could be a guard coming.
[57:38.03]Who knows?
[57:38.39]Are you ready?
[57:38.93]One, two, three, go.
[57:45.89]So we have to pull the toilet back.
[57:51.25]Okay, yeah, we do.
[57:53.87]This was very poorly made.
[57:55.30]Where are you going?
[57:57.34]Excuse me.
[57:59.58]All right, we move at the same time.
[58:01.68]We just need somebody in front of me.
[58:09.55]What over here?
[58:10.01]Are we gonna let this guy out too?
[58:11.12]Is this one of those situations where we're always gonna pull the lever?
[58:13.60]Is this the first time we've been together?
[58:14.90]Well, besides the... Alright, make sure I don't Dark Souls you here.
[58:18.02]I don't see anything.
[58:26.53]That is... Yeah, I saw that.
[58:27.81]I was just saying that you can put your hand in.
[58:29.81]I know.
[58:31.31]Why is there a grate behind the toilet?
[58:32.75]Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.
[58:41.02]Are we supposed to be going anywhere over here?
[58:44.52]Didn't really think this plan through, you know?
[58:46.34]We can't break this open?
[58:47.70]We can do a 1, 2, 3 run and ram into that, right?
[58:53.51]What about over here?
[58:55.13]This is where we came from.
[58:55.91]I mean, it's got to be those stairs.
[58:59.31]Wait, wait, what's this?
[59:00.31]Come over here and help me.
[59:01.83]We can rip this thing off.
[59:03.98]Oh, good find, man.
[59:06.60]Watch your head.
[59:11.74]I love how I get to be the stick guy.
[59:15.20]You are the stick guy, actually.
[59:17.30]He's jamming in there.
[59:22.90]Really?
[59:23.20]Wait, oh, I have to tap.
[59:25.02]This doesn't look safe.
[59:27.66]I'll just go right on through.
[59:28.84]I have the utmost faith in you.
[59:31.93]Yeah, I could have just chopped you up.
[59:33.57]Alright, now you do it.
[59:38.01]Can I hand this to you?
[59:41.06]No, I think you have to go the other way.
[59:46.72]No, I want to do it.
[59:48.06]Do it.
[59:48.56]Okay, let's try to cut your head off.
[59:50.16]Just see what happens.
[59:50.80]Alright, we need to see what happens.
[59:51.58]I'm going to try to cut off your head.
[59:52.70]This may be the only opportunity in the entire game.
[59:54.99]That's true.
[59:55.37]Alright, stay there.
[59:57.25]I don't move.
[60:02.81]That's it.
[60:03.89]I'm disappointed.
[60:05.43]It just kind of hurts a little.
[60:06.73]That's all.
[60:09.15]Just gives you a stomachache.
[60:11.13]Okay, so what if, though, what if we did that and we woke back up in the hospital scene again?
[60:15.48]Oh, no, we had to do the tapping again?
[60:16.80]That would be pretty bad.
[60:17.68]It's a good thing that your character is using the technique.
[60:28.30]Usually means... Well, it just usually means, like, hey, something's about to happen here.
[60:31.41]Get ready.
[60:31.77]Metal detector sound.
[60:32.47]All right, try to crawl through now.
[60:36.03]Careful.
[60:37.13]You have to go... I know, I have to push a button on the other side.
[60:43.06]Did you shut down the fan from where you are?
[60:45.06]Come and help me.
[60:48.44]That doesn't answer the... Okay, apparently not.
[60:51.35]You've got to turn off the button.
[60:54.19]Come on, help me.
[60:55.49]I can't.
[60:55.87]What am I supposed to do about that?
[60:59.11]Can I turn off... There's got to be a button you can press, right?
[61:04.87]They hid it back here with the high voltage warning.
[61:10.21]All right, it's shut down.
[61:11.27]You can go through now.
[61:14.29]Can I keep the bar?
[61:15.07]No.
[61:16.05]Why don't you turn it back on?
[61:21.21]Come and help me.
[61:21.75]Let's go pull it.
[61:24.53]Cutscene.
[61:29.66]Leave without him.
[61:31.36]Thanks for helping me get this far.
[61:33.86]It's a long way down.
[61:35.72]Yeah.
[61:36.64]I'm going to push you.
[61:37.68]If it gives me a prompt, I'm going to push you.
[61:39.66]Of course you are.
[61:44.95]Hold on.
[61:47.69]Yeah, why wouldn't you keep the bar?
[61:48.99]Over here.
[61:49.31]I don't know.
[61:52.75]It's just... We don't have time for achievements.
[61:55.63]Check this out.
[61:56.79]What are you thinking?
[61:57.57]There's always time for achievements.
[61:58.65]I'm thinking sheets.
[62:01.25]All right.
[62:02.17]Let me hear it.
[62:03.89]Okay.
[62:04.73]We need to find a way into this room.
[62:07.11]Once we do that, we can get the sheets in here.
[62:10.37]Sounds easy enough.
[62:11.25]You know how in the old-timey movies where you have to tie all the sheets together and, like, drape them over the wall?
[62:17.33]And that's how everyone escapes prison?
[62:19.31]Maybe get a laundry cart.
[62:22.07]Once we have the cart, one of us has to hide in it.
[62:26.04]That way.
[62:27.74]The guard will inspect it and then bring it to the back room.
[62:31.44]A way in?
[62:32.46]This is the classic, like, Ocean's Eleven, like, here's what's going to happen sequence.
[62:36.66]As long as we're covered in some sheets, we should be fine.
[62:39.88]We're going to fumble this one in the end zone for sure.
[62:42.14]Wow, look at you.
[62:42.78]It's you on the left.
[62:44.06]You were behind the wall.
[62:45.42]Now you're in the laundry room.
[62:48.93]How did we get in here without them knowing that we came from that direction?
[62:55.34]Wouldn't we have to walk in here somehow?
[62:59.46]The real question is if it's lights out right now, what are all these people doing?
[63:04.19]Is this like the night shift?
[63:05.39]All right, so let's think about this.
[63:07.91]So I'm going to get inside the dryer.
[63:10.83]Okay, I'll distract this guy.
[63:12.73]First time I've seen someone smile in here.
[63:15.51]You can't get in the dryer.
[63:17.90]That's great.
[63:19.22]Is there a dryer?
[63:19.78]Can I get?
[63:20.10]Okay, here's the plan.
[63:20.76]I'm going to get in the dryer and you turn it on.
[63:24.18]You got any family on the outside?
[63:26.24]Nope.
[63:26.90]I'm just gonna get drunk and hit up strip clubs.
[63:30.44]But I'm guessing you can't do that for the rest of your life.
[63:33.12]Why not?
[63:34.04]There are plenty of strip clubs out there.
[63:36.10]All right, then.
[63:37.18]Have fun.
[63:37.88]I will.
[63:39.06]What am I looking for in here?
[63:40.06]This guy, I respect that man.
[63:41.61]Simple man.
[63:43.25]Maybe a cart.
[63:45.57]Smash the glass?
[63:46.47]No.
[63:48.99]Okay, here we go.
[63:49.43]There's a cart in here.
[63:52.42]It's worth a try.
[63:53.74]I need a laundry cart.
[63:55.10]Oh, can I have your number, please?
[63:57.54]Uh, yeah.
[63:59.62]2-1-1-1-2-2-2.
[63:59.76]It's just a cart, man.
[64:02.40]I need your name and number.
[64:06.07]Uh... You sure I'm not on the list?
[64:09.79]Convince him.
[64:10.93]Leo.
[64:12.59]Who closed it?
[64:13.39]It's not here.
[64:14.31]Why are you fighting people?
[64:18.29]Convinced.
[64:18.77]I just had to convince that guy.
[64:24.12]I did some laundry.
[64:25.76]Okay, I got a cart.
[64:27.00]Oh, you need to be here.
[64:29.26]Wait, wait, wait, I'll get out.
[64:31.74]I'll bring it to you, and then you have to get out.
[64:34.28]No, don't get back in.
[64:35.34]Shit.
[64:49.05]Is that guy gonna wake up after I beat him up?
[64:52.75]I got a cart.
[64:53.29]Let's go.
[64:53.67]We have to get all the sheets, though.
[64:58.02]Alright, so you grab some sheets.
[65:00.78]Can I run really fast with this?
[65:03.08]I can't do the thing in the grocery store where you run, run, run, run, run, jump and step on the back and glide?
[65:07.26]Okay, here we go.
[65:12.95]Are you sure I can't help?
[65:15.13]Yeah, nobody sees dirt like I do.
[65:17.06]Because dirt leads to germs, germs leads to disease, and disease leads to death.
[65:20.08]You have to get over here.
[65:21.26]I have to make like a U sandwich.
[65:23.22]I'm getting to know all these prisoners because I'm going to come back for them.
[65:25.70]I'm going to come back and release them all.
[65:27.34]People will see me.
[65:30.28]I need to put like two... The shirts are going to be the buns.
[65:32.48]You're going to be the meat.
[65:34.38]What?
[65:35.26]I'm going to put some detergent in there for the lettuce.
[65:38.02]You have to get in here.
[65:39.93]We have to load this with sheets and I have to make a username.
[65:41.57]Yeah, but we still have to put sheets in it.
[65:44.15]Yeah, so I just did.
[65:45.96]There's enough sheets in there, right?
[65:48.80]How many more do we have?
[65:49.58]We put like four t-shirts in there.
[65:50.88]No, that's enough.
[65:51.34]That's enough.
[65:51.68]Alright, so follow me.
[65:52.20]Well, it is now.
[65:53.52]I'm stuck.
[65:55.80]No, put down the t-shirt.
[65:58.79]Put down your priest robes and get in here.
[66:00.95]Oh my god.
[66:06.32]All the way this way.
[66:06.80]Why do you get to be the push?
[66:08.52]You want to be the guy inside?
[66:11.24]Don't go in now.
[66:12.06]We need to go back to the room where I got it.
[66:15.87]Alright, sit here.
[66:17.01]You want to push or you want to go in?
[66:18.69]It doesn't matter.
[66:20.87]I'm already pushing, so you just go in.
[66:22.81]Pull it back so I can actually access it.
[66:24.91]Okay, you parked too close to the other vehicle.
[66:26.45]All right.
[66:26.91]It's all right.
[66:27.35]Don't get out now.
[66:28.41]I'm not planning to.
[66:29.69]Remember, stay hidden.
[66:30.83]Of course.
[66:32.19]Where am I supposed to take you?
[66:33.53]Shh.
[66:34.04]Into the back room?
[66:35.16]They're going to get suspicious.
[66:36.86]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[66:38.90]I gain entrance to the back room.
[66:43.90]What back room?
[66:46.10]I think it's like up ahead where the behind bars.
[66:48.92]I see.
[66:53.85]I just got some laundry here.
[66:55.87]No big deal.
[66:57.21]See you fucking later.
[67:01.01]What are you doing?
[67:08.06]This wasn't a surprise birthday party for the guard.
[67:11.48]You weren't like a sexy person in a cake.
[67:14.14]What the fuck are you doing?
[67:17.35]Oh, god damn it.
[67:18.47]I had to do it.
[67:21.44]You would have done the same thing in my shoes.
[67:30.85]There's a stripper in that cart.
[67:33.89]I was already nude once this game.
[67:35.81]If you think I won't do it again, you're mistaken.
[67:38.85]Put some laundry lettuce in here.
[67:40.89]I had some practice earlier.
[67:45.53]Oh, god damn it.
[67:48.15]It's too close.
[67:49.82]These are gonna be dirty sheets.
[67:51.70]And I've pushed it on the... whatever.
[67:54.68]No, you have to put that one in.
[67:56.52]Can you get that one or do I have to move it again?
[67:58.68]That's it.
[67:59.00]Only one.
[67:59.32]Alright, that's fine.
[68:00.70]How about right here?
[68:01.42]No, wait.
[68:01.94]We can probably do it over here.
[68:04.18]Yeah.
[68:08.82]Do it, like, right next to this guy, just to show him, like, how, like, yeah, you're stuck here.
[68:11.94]I think it has to be in that back room.
[68:15.65]Yeah, it does.
[68:22.42]On the floor, yeah.
[68:23.40]Alright, get in.
[68:28.05]I know this time don't birthday cake this.
[68:29.79]Don't get out now.
[68:30.87]I'm not planning to.
[68:35.13]I'm not planning to.
[68:36.93]Like does it 30 seconds later?
[68:38.71]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[68:40.47]Wait, what does that mean, hide?
[68:41.57]It means put a pillow over your face.
[68:45.35]Oh, I see.
[68:45.77]You're going to have to do that.
[68:47.63]They're going to look in here.
[68:48.60]They're going to inspect the laundry.
[68:49.94]They're going to poke around in there with the knife.
[68:52.68]I've already seen this in the Bilbo Baggins movie.
[68:54.62]Remember with the fishes?
[68:55.96]They were in the fishes and the guy comes over and he's like, Are you having trouble there?
[69:00.04]So you have to be the fish in the barrel.
[69:02.69]Alright, I'm hiding.
[69:03.35]Am I going to start coughing?
[69:05.91]Can I breathe?
[69:08.95]The temptation to let go is so strong.
[69:12.55]So now you're going to go into the laundry.
[69:15.89]Okay, time to get rid of that guard now.
[69:18.49]Getting rid of that guard, that's kind of an interesting way to put it.
[69:21.45]I'm in the minecart segment.
[69:25.88]What are you doing?
[69:26.82]Get the hell back to work.
[69:28.20]Face punch.
[69:31.70]Yeah, but I think those two guys are just about to fight.
[69:35.26]Where?
[69:38.30]They're all doing laundry.
[69:41.14]Stop flying and get back to work.
[69:42.56]Those guys are going to fight.
[69:43.38]The guys just stand there.
[69:45.14]Oh, god damn it.
[69:49.26]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[69:50.92]What are you doing?
[69:52.12]Oh, no.
[69:52.44]Oh, no.
[69:52.94]Oh, don't get caught.
[69:53.76]I'm out.
[69:54.34]Don't get caught.
[69:54.94]Duck.
[69:56.26]How?
[69:56.72]I don't know.
[69:57.20]It's up to grab a sheet.
[69:59.26]What's he doing?
[70:00.56]No, I didn't do this.
[70:04.16]You're just delivering something.
[70:06.76]It don't work.
[70:13.13]I didn't just try to open the fucking door to leave.
[70:16.01]What am I stealing sheets for?
[70:17.45]I don't know.
[70:20.31]I have to go break something.
[70:21.27]I have to start a fight.
[70:22.39]That's what has to happen.
[70:23.19]I gotta go tell, like, Larry that Joey over here fucking hates his guts.
[70:27.71]You seem to be having a great day.
[70:29.65]You got that shit, right?
[70:30.79]You're looking at a free man.
[70:32.00]Oh, put him back in.
[70:33.34]We're gonna get a fight.
[70:34.08]Yep, next week is my last.
[70:35.50]They're setting this guy up for a total.
[70:39.32]Make sure to stay out of trouble, then.
[70:41.45]Yeah.
[70:42.13]How does he not see me?
[70:43.45]What do you mean?
[70:44.33]Well, you know, shit happens.
[70:46.45]Yep.
[70:46.63]You talk to the wrong guy in here, and suddenly, ten more years.
[70:50.76]Don't know how we go.
[70:52.98]I just gave this guy ten more- Wait, no, no, I wanted- I think I got caught.
[71:01.09]I think I got caught.
[71:02.73]Did you just punch me in the head?
[71:20.46]Started like a fight back here.
[71:22.44]That's so dumb.
[71:25.29]Alright, so let's do this again.
[71:27.27]I might have to actually start a fight first.
[71:35.20]Who's that guy?
[71:37.00]It's ironing.
[71:37.30]That's that easy.
[71:38.14]Alright, there we go.
[71:39.40]Now tattletale.
[71:40.50]Oh, it's locked.
[71:41.22]What?
[71:41.38]Key?
[71:41.52]I need a key.
[72:08.42]Is this guy not gonna do anything about this?
[72:12.99]What is this guy doing?
[72:18.13]Oh, hold on.
[72:19.15]Why am I just doing the job for this guy?
[72:23.81]Where's the key?
[72:29.27]Key?
[72:30.79]Oh, I can see you.
[72:32.21]Wait, do you have to give me the key?
[72:37.10]I was told to steal sheets.
[72:39.30]So I've been stealing sheets.
[72:40.58]Wait, I can just go in here!
[72:41.70]No, I can't.
[72:44.99]There, I think I've stolen enough now.
[72:46.89]Alright, so... He's still not over here.
[72:49.65]I think I have to grab something from you.
[72:51.49]It's locked.
[72:52.49]Well, uh... I would love to help you with that, but then this guard just came back.
[72:58.39]Alright, so I can open up.
[73:02.27]Maybe if I talk to the guy?
[73:03.31]Alright, I'm gonna, like, cause a problem.
[73:07.26]Now, that's it.
[73:07.66]He just waves at you.
[73:09.38]Door's open.
[73:09.90]Is it?
[73:10.18]Go.
[73:10.34]Door's open.
[73:10.68]Nice.
[73:12.52]Quick.
[73:15.48]Is a person here?
[73:16.68]There is a person here, but he's not looking.
[73:18.44]Oh, my God.
[73:18.98]Come on.
[73:19.32]Come on.
[73:19.62]Come on.
[73:20.02]I'm so terrified.
[73:21.22]I'm not ready.
[73:22.12]Right now.
[73:24.89]Okay.
[73:25.19]Why are we stealing sheets?
[73:27.51]I was told to steal sheets.
[73:28.73]Steal sheets?
[73:29.23]Why?
[73:29.55]I've got an assortment here for us to choose between.
[73:32.42]There's the vent.
[73:33.80]Now we need to put the sheets into it.
[73:35.84]Whichever one you like is good.
[73:38.50]How are we supposed to stuff it in there?
[73:40.66]We have to do this.
[73:43.86]What are we doing?
[73:44.34]This is me.
[73:45.66]I was stuck inside of a hamper.
[73:47.04]You do it.
[73:48.74]You boost me.
[73:49.88]Oh, I thought you were just doing a weird stance.
[73:51.58]Okay.
[73:52.59]I thought you were cracking your knuckles like, here we go.
[73:54.97]Oh, the vent's up there.
[74:01.45]Come on, hand me some sheets.
[74:03.27]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm coming.
[74:05.35]I got plenty for you there.
[74:06.73]What's that famous painting?
[74:10.09]Wait.
[74:10.25]Can't reach.
[74:10.81]What do you mean, can't reach?
[74:12.29]I can't reach.
[74:14.13]How?
[74:16.04]Just give him.
[74:16.66]There we go.
[74:19.69]Somebody's gonna come in here and see this.
[74:22.19]No one's gonna see this.
[74:25.20]There's another one, and another one.
[74:29.18]I'm going.
[74:31.14]I made this so easy for you.
[74:33.62]All the sheets are just right there.
[74:35.98]Nice job.
[74:37.40]I know, thanks.
[74:38.42]God's creation of man, whatever it is.
[74:40.18]We're good.
[74:45.96]I'm too short, yeah.
[74:57.27]Uh-oh, they're gonna find it.
[74:58.19]Oh, this is us.
[75:01.11]How have they still not noticed we're not in our rooms?
[75:04.44]All right, that should do it.
[75:07.08]Yeah, let's hope so.
[75:09.80]So who wants to go first?
[75:10.76]I don't want to test this.
[75:12.58]Shouldn't we have tied a weight to this to make sure it could go?
[75:14.22]We'll just both go at the same time.
[75:17.08]That's how confident we are.
[75:19.34]Not a bad idea.
[75:20.28]There's a guard over here on the left.
[75:21.34]We got a very heavy grate.
[75:22.10]That's not scary or anything.
[75:39.86]They're both over there.
[75:40.54]They might be coming this way.
[75:41.44]That guy at least might be.
[75:43.44]I don't know.
[75:43.74]What is this?
[75:45.06]We have to open this thing together?
[75:46.73]Mm-hmm.
[75:48.05]This is a co-op moment.
[75:49.79]Cooperative moment?
[75:51.13]Mm-hmm.
[75:52.91]Perfect sync.
[75:55.77]100% accuracy.
[75:56.17]Yeah, that was good.
[75:57.19]Nice work.
[75:58.27]You ready to get down there?
[76:04.40]Really?
[76:05.14]It's pitch black.
[76:06.30]We need a light.
[76:08.02]Ah, fuck it.
[76:08.88]I'll go first.
[76:12.00]Dead.
[76:12.16]Mm-hmm.
[76:12.46]Game over.
[76:13.70]Game over.
[76:14.10]Well, now you get to play.
[76:15.28]I'm gonna be the only player.
[76:16.52]I just follow you around as a ghost.
[76:17.74]I follow you around as like a time trial ghost.
[76:19.52]Alright.
[76:22.02]Why a time trial, though?
[76:23.36]I don't know.
[76:24.04]Alright, you need to turn on the electricity.
[76:26.93]No, I'm going to find you a tool.
[76:30.61]Oh, there's a flashlight.
[76:31.43]Alright, throw it down.
[76:35.77]Listen.
[76:37.71]I am doing my best right now.
[76:40.03]Oh shit.
[76:40.63]Okay, I can get back up.
[76:42.61]I'm gonna drop it in the water.
[76:44.21]Alright, well you're the flashlight guy then.
[76:49.58]I am the flashlight guy.
[76:50.60]Can you see good?
[76:51.86]I mean, not really, but aim that over here.
[76:53.62]So I can do this.
[76:54.18]Turning off the water.
[77:11.28]Hey, um, thank you for that.
[77:12.26]I'm the star of the show.
[77:13.32]That's really, really nice that I can now see your room, Bill.
[77:17.38]As long as I know where I'm going, then we can move on.
[77:21.25]Oh, god damn it.
[77:22.03]This water smells like shit.
[77:25.07]Well, it is shit.
[77:26.51]Are you being funny now?
[77:27.81]No, I'm just stating facts.
[77:29.71]Ooh, that's gross.
[77:32.35]Fuck you, man.
[77:37.02]Okay.
[77:37.92]Well, I don't think I can go up there.
[77:40.30]That was a good comedy timing.
[77:41.64]Let me try it again.
[77:42.90]I can do it.
[77:44.30]Yeah, this is just like when you were a kid and it was raining outside and you tried to impress all your friends and you could try to run up the slide.
[77:50.47]Yeah.
[77:51.27]It's impossible to run up a slide, guys, especially when it's raining.
[77:54.33]But a lot of you did it.
[77:55.33]A lot of you tried to run up the slide and you got a busted nose, didn't you?
[78:00.61]Another valve over here, Leo.
[78:04.44]Nice real-time shadows.
[78:07.12]Yeah, how many times did you get shit on a slide when you were younger and just try to run off?
[78:13.14]I'm kind of stuck up here.
[78:14.54]Well, I can get up right now.
[78:18.20]Here I am.
[78:18.72]Hi.
[78:22.56]Pass it.
[78:34.83]Yes, press the square button.
[78:38.46]Oh my lord, I pulled out.
[78:40.18]Thank you.
[78:40.50]How do you aim the flashlight?
[78:41.92]Alright, so I'm gonna go over here.
[78:43.48]Whoa.
[78:58.82]I guess we're going down this way.
[78:59.92]Yeah, I think that's the way I'm going right now.
[79:01.94]I think I see you.
[79:02.51]I see you.
[79:02.91]You see me?
[79:03.77]This way.
[79:04.53]Alright, let me bust this lock open with a light.
[79:06.55]There's a guard in here with me.
[79:07.45]There's a guard in here?
[79:09.31]Mm-hmm.
[79:09.79]He's right behind me.
[79:10.27]Hurry.
[79:10.45]What do you mean, hurry?
[79:11.37]This should work.
[79:12.61]Tap the square button, right?
[79:13.45]It always works in the movies.
[79:17.68]Just, you know.
[79:18.50]Alright, get in here.
[79:21.80]Should I not be aiming the flashlight back there?
[79:23.42]That's probably a bad idea.
[79:26.20]It's not the joke.
[79:26.88]There's no cards.
[79:27.60]Oh, you... Maybe rush for no reason.
[79:31.55]All right, we have to do this at the same time, I think.
[79:33.45]Good.
[79:35.89]That could have been really, really awkward for a minute or two.
[79:38.05]He just instantly... Hey, can you see where you're going?
[79:40.69]I don't know where we're going.
[79:41.89]All right, where are you going?
[79:43.05]I don't know.
[79:43.45]I'm trying to...
[79:58.46]This way.
[79:59.02]I'm dependent on you right now.
[80:01.68]That's not true.
[80:02.25]I can't claim you on my taxes.
[80:03.37]I wish I could.
[80:04.47]I knew there was a tax joke in there.
[80:05.89]It's relevant.
[80:06.47]It's in like a week.
[80:08.77]That's in a week.
[80:09.39]I get that one.
[80:10.13]I was just gonna say it, but I didn't have to.
[80:13.97]I get that one.
[80:16.07]Flashlight's dead.
[80:18.80]This looks sharp.
[80:20.38]Like, this would be very sharp.
[80:24.72]Watch your fingers.
[80:26.00]When do we get the first, like, weapon?
[80:30.33]Oh, fuck.
[80:31.79]It's too high.
[80:32.53]Rats are not disgusting.
[80:33.69]No, they're not.
[80:34.27]Rats are wonderful.
[80:35.04]Once we kill someone that has them.
[80:39.74]Ready for some splinter cell?
[80:40.74]Here.
[80:42.28]This is so easy.
[80:43.00]Just do the, just do the ya-wa-ya Mario jump from side to side.
[80:46.15]He could do it.
[80:47.79]Just do it like eight times.
[80:49.11]No, we're going back to back, buddy.
[80:52.45]This just doesn't, this doesn't work.
[80:53.87]Hey, just like your character, man.
[80:55.71]No faith.
[80:56.39]This is dumb.
[80:56.83]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[80:57.95]Okay, we don't, we have to go pendulum in the middle.
[81:09.04]All right, one, two, three.
[81:11.90]Come on, you gotta, okay, fine.
[81:15.94]Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
[81:17.34]Okay, okay.
[81:18.04]What happened?
[81:19.74]I'm trying to fail it.
[81:21.80]All right, it's funny, the joke happened.
[81:27.77]Oops.
[81:35.07]I'm not trying to fail it this time.
[81:41.84]This is just a reality show.
[81:44.46]Alright, we're gonna go just square, square.
[81:50.86]No, wait, wait, wait.
[81:52.10]Stop it.
[81:53.04]I'm telling you what we're gonna do.
[81:54.22]Wait, wait, wait.
[81:55.30]Alright, we're even.
[81:56.40]Ready?
[81:56.60]So it's gonna be... We are even, yeah.
[81:57.94]Bang.
[81:58.42]Stop.
[81:59.14]Bang.
[81:59.48]You know what I'm saying?
[82:00.41]Bang.
[82:00.81]Yeah, you hit the square button when the circle's inside of the shoehorn.
[82:05.49]We're gonna do one next pass.
[82:07.09]Here we go.
[82:07.59]Ready?
[82:08.11]On the next pass.
[82:09.17]Go.
[82:10.66]Fuck.
[82:13.28]Wow.
[82:15.68]You wanna catch up there?
[82:16.62]I'll catch up.
[82:17.01]You good?
[82:17.57]Go.
[82:18.71]Uh-oh.
[82:24.83]Hey, take it easy, man.
[82:26.35]All right, my turn.
[82:26.87]Okay, all right, all right.
[82:28.19]Come on.
[82:28.49]All right, I'm gonna slow down.
[82:30.41]You, wow.
[82:32.94]You gotta, you just, come on.
[82:34.06]You're good.
[82:38.87]The guard, there's a guard just there.
[82:41.91]Honestly, I would be like, holy shit, guys.
[82:45.12]I'm not even mad, I'm impressed.
[82:46.68]Wait, wait, wait, don't go, don't go.
[82:50.14]We have to go one after the other here.
[82:51.46]You go.
[82:52.06]So, now I'm gonna go, now you go.
[82:54.96]Again.
[82:56.90]Fuck, I'm so dumb.
[83:03.99]Oh my god.
[83:04.87]There's like a- there's a slight delay.
[83:07.23]You know what I'm talking about?
[83:08.49]There's a slight- Alright, don't move.
[83:11.49]I didn't do it.
[83:12.15]You go.
[83:13.15]There's an ever so slight delay.
[83:14.67]You gotta do it.
[83:16.48]Okay.
[83:17.70]Oh my god, this slight delay is making me wanna die.
[83:21.34]No, don't fall.
[83:24.38]This is like a 30 foot fall at this point.
[83:29.23]Oh, how'd I miss?
[83:30.21]I missed.
[83:31.23]Okay, I'm gonna give you a minute.
[83:35.91]Oh, fuck me, dude.
[83:38.28]Oh, no.
[83:40.34]Go, go.
[83:40.96]It's okay, we're fine.
[83:46.02]Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
[83:47.82]Are you keeping up or not?
[83:49.20]I didn't do anything.
[83:50.22]I'm keeping up.
[83:51.62]No, no, don't move.
[83:53.32]All right, all right.
[83:58.04]You missed like three in a row.
[83:58.86]No, I didn't.
[83:59.12]I just did three in a row.
[84:00.08]I didn't know we were going again.
[84:01.40]Okay, go.
[84:04.21]All right, now we're back to back again.
[84:05.21]We're fine.
[84:08.02]There we go.
[84:08.72]Look at that coordination.
[84:10.46]Look at this coordination.
[84:11.38]It's fine.
[84:12.16]It's good.
[84:13.54]We got like six in a row there together.
[84:16.49]Probably like holding my breath.
[84:24.35]At last.
[84:25.81]Freddo Heights.
[84:27.01]Something like that.
[84:28.85]That would take immense lower body strength.
[84:31.78]Yeah, staying that... Staying as long as we stood there.
[84:35.94]That would take an incredible amount of strength, you're right.
[84:38.92]With shoes on.
[84:39.78]Like, I have dress shoes on.
[84:42.16]To actually do what we just did, you need bare feet and have webs and suction cups on the bottom of your feet.
[84:45.98]But now what?
[84:47.62]I don't know.
[84:50.10]I think we're gonna sleep here.
[84:59.61]Okay, but really though, what if a guard walked over and you just reach your hand up and grab his ankle?
[85:04.72]What would he do?
[85:05.54]We actually are sleeping here.
[85:07.26]Why would you ever sleep here?
[85:09.10]That was a really good guess.
[85:11.76]There's no room.
[85:12.52]I would not do it.
[85:13.30]I move around way too much.
[85:14.20]I would be dead up there.
[85:17.16]How?
[85:18.22]What?
[85:18.38]I think we're just jumping around timelines here.
[85:27.19]Did we open a carpentry, like, workshop?
[85:29.91]I don't know.
[85:35.30]They don't sleep there?
[85:36.38]Well, what, did they go back down?
[85:41.04]It looked like it let in.
[85:41.90]Now we're in shop class.
[85:48.14]Smuggle wrench to the cell.
[85:54.83]It's going to grate the cheese for a little bit.
[85:57.69]Why did we climb all the way up to the top just to come back?
[86:00.48]How did we even get down?
[86:02.12]That climbing technique does not get you down.
[86:08.22]I can't stand leaving a loose nail like this.
[86:16.59]That's better.
[86:17.09]That's a much more fun game.
[86:19.05]I just want to do this one for the rest of the game.
[86:24.07]Gravity all right smuggled rents to sell is the wrench Hey, that's my wrench it is none of us own any other stuff right distract him Hands off, that's mine.
[86:39.10]I'm just sorry.
[86:41.44]He's the same thing that I did I'm sorry, I will
[86:50.66]Hey, that's my wrench.
[86:52.72]It is?
[86:53.94]Okay.
[86:54.40]Oh, it's your wrench.
[86:55.18]Oh, I didn't know.
[86:55.74]Sorry about that.
[86:56.52]All right, I'm going to distract him.
[86:57.64]Get it.
[86:57.82]Hey.
[86:59.26]Hey.
[87:00.90]What do you want?
[87:02.53]What do I want?
[87:03.15]Get his wrench.
[87:04.43]What do you want?
[87:09.53]I want you to turn down that attitude a little.
[87:12.17]What attitude?
[87:13.45]I don't have an attitude.
[87:14.77]Nice work.
[87:15.29]There you go.
[87:16.27]Get it.
[87:16.69]He'll never know it was us.
[87:17.77]I'm just trying to do my job here.
[87:20.32]We only reached for it about eight times.
[87:22.14]Alright, smuggle the wrench to the cell.
[87:26.77]How the hell are we gonna do that?
[87:27.67]I thought you were cutting bread.
[87:30.73]I was like, that's like a big bulky French roll.
[87:33.44]Nice.
[87:34.66]We probably have to store it in something.
[87:41.48]If I'm gonna take a wild guess, we have to make a box to put the wrench in.
[87:45.60]careful looks like that could take your finger off could it already has what am I doing wow insensitive all right so I love it wait I think I have to come over there and do something with you ever go uh missing sure all the time where are you but uh what about the metal detector yeah people figure out a way to get past it
[88:10.16]That's it, huh?
[88:11.20]Nothing to do with this guy?
[88:13.64]You have the wrench!
[88:15.18]I forgot that I had the wrench on me.
[88:17.48]God damn it.
[88:19.40]Yeah, you had the wrench in your pocket.
[88:21.35]It was in my pocket.
[88:23.23]You got metal detected.
[88:24.47]I told you that it's important to remember the metal detector tech- technique.
[88:30.33]Metal detector tech.
[88:31.59]No, we've got the wrench.
[88:32.73]You have it already?
[88:33.73]Yeah, we have it already.
[88:37.32]I already played with that I do know that we need to go around to the other side and open a little great We need to get you need to go through the metal without it, and you shouldn't need a hammer I Told you I didn't lose it.
[88:58.61]I gave it back to you yesterday.
[89:00.47]Well.
[89:00.71]You better.
[89:01.13]Hope you're right because I can't find here I
[89:05.29]Are you sharpening that thing?
[89:06.67]Alright, I need a hammer.
[89:09.73]I want to make sure that if I need to, you know.
[89:13.53]Kill somebody with like a table leg.
[89:15.69]Alright, now walk away with the hammer.
[89:21.59]Okay, I'm fine.
[89:26.12]Yeah, I did it.
[89:26.80]So now I want to take the hammer to that guy.
[89:29.66]Never mind.
[89:31.12]Alright, see I don't have anything in my pockets.
[89:33.02]So I can just walk out.
[89:35.18]So now... I'll stand here and watch.
[89:39.63]Not that way though.
[89:40.79]What do you mean not this way?
[89:41.69]Go the other way.
[89:45.65]There we go.
[89:46.11]Okay.
[89:46.51]That's fine.
[89:46.89]Now you can walk through.
[89:47.69]Nice.
[89:47.79]Nice.
[89:58.60]Okay.
[89:59.00]Vent behind the bin.
[90:00.91]I'll take care of the vent.
[90:03.01]I probably have to distract.
[90:08.25]He definitely told me to go on the other side the first... Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
[90:13.81]No, I think you have to... You have to pass something to me?
[90:17.29]Why would you pass the wrench to me?
[90:19.31]I don't know.
[90:19.65]We're already on the other side, so I'm not really sure.
[90:22.56]Just pass me the wrench.
[90:23.76]Maybe there were two ways to go about it.
[90:25.34]You could either pass the wrench or...
[90:29.86]Oh, okay.
[90:31.72]Thanks, man.
[90:32.14]I appreciate it.
[90:33.06]All right, we got the wrench.
[90:33.98]I could have just handed that off to you about a minute ago, but this is fine.
[90:38.04]This is less suspicious.
[90:39.44]Let's go down here.
[90:40.20]Excuse me, sir.
[90:42.58]I think we just have to get back to the cell.
[90:46.86]195 IQ play.
[90:56.71]Uh, alright.
[90:57.21]What about other metal detectors?
[90:59.36]We're gonna get a hand here in a second.
[91:00.50]You've got the... Oh, shit.
[91:02.82]I got it.
[91:03.34]I'll handle it.
[91:04.10]You handle it?
[91:04.60]Wait.
[91:04.90]Wait, no, no, wait.
[91:05.50]You go through and we're gonna do a handoff.
[91:09.02]You know the drill.
[91:10.18]Get on the other side and help me.
[91:12.34]Listen, don't tell the guard our plan.
[91:15.20]Keep that one a secret.
[91:16.40]Come on over here.
[91:22.88]Beautiful.
[91:26.40]You can search me.
[91:26.98]It's fine.
[91:27.48]I got nothing to hide.
[91:29.65]Hey.
[91:29.85]Alright.
[91:32.67]Dude, I think the game just broke right there.
[91:34.17]It just went into the default 3D modeling pose.
[91:36.53]That's fucking weird.
[91:38.03]That is weird.
[91:38.67]It's strange.
[91:41.18]I think they would have figured that out and ironed that bug out before release.
[91:43.88]Did you praise the sun?
[91:46.24]It's like a weird graphical glitch.
[91:47.68]I'm surprised no reviewers talked about that one.
[91:50.34]Alright, handle the guard.
[91:56.24]Hey, boys, there's a problem.
[91:57.86]What is it?
[91:58.70]Let me show you.
[91:59.27]Come on.
[91:59.83]Let me show you.
[92:00.31]It's over here.
[92:02.35]Well, that's me.
[92:03.75]That's me.
[92:04.45]What's going on?
[92:04.97]Wait, did you just say get in the way?
[92:07.57]Hold on.
[92:07.87]Come back over here.
[92:09.25]Come back over here.
[92:15.87]There's something going on downstairs.
[92:17.53]I think it's a fight.
[92:19.80]Let's go.
[92:20.48]All right.
[92:20.84]Step aside.
[92:23.24]All right.
[92:23.52]Let's go.
[92:25.27]Hey!
[92:25.59]Oh, shit.
[92:27.07]I wanted to help.
[92:28.93]All right, good.
[92:29.27]You handled the guards.
[92:31.13]Now back up to the cell.
[92:37.34]And then our plan will be set into motion.
[92:39.48]And then what, we're gonna attach the toilets again?
[92:44.02]Why is he waiting outside my cell?
[92:45.74]No, it's just time to go to bed.
[92:51.65]Shakedown!
[92:52.79]Up against the bars, inmate.
[92:54.86]Uh-oh.
[92:55.34]Shakedown.
[92:55.65]Did you hear me?
[92:56.45]Who has the wrench?
[92:57.99]Me.
[92:58.09]I've got the wrench.
[92:58.79]Oh, shit.
[92:59.13]Wait.
[92:59.43]I'm going to fake puke or something, right?
[93:00.33]He's in my office.
[93:01.17]I'm going to fake puke.
[93:03.75]Right?
[93:03.89]This is what you do.
[93:05.55]It's square.
[93:05.85]Hurry.
[93:06.71]I got... All right.
[93:08.47]Now, I'm going to go like... I got it.
[93:13.04]Hand it off.
[93:13.38]It passed.
[93:16.02]Nice.
[93:17.02]Clean.
[93:17.62]You're going to get shook down next, though.
[93:19.98]Yeah, and then I'm going to go back and forth to you.
[93:23.39]Don't they search the toilets in shakedowns too?
[93:25.53]Wait, hold on.
[93:27.53]Out of the bed.
[93:28.39]In the toilet.
[93:29.97]Like if they find the hole behind the toilet, we're done anyway.
[93:36.17]So you may as well.
[93:39.25]I feel like we're getting picked on.
[93:47.92]Nobody else in the prison has to endure this much.
[93:52.04]Maybe they know.
[93:54.70]Oh, I'm a little sweaty.
[93:55.84]Sorry.
[93:56.82]Yeah, how are you supposed to go to the bathroom if the toilet doesn't actually attach to anything?
[94:04.76]Uh, that's the trick.
[94:09.04]It just collects.
[94:10.34]Yeah, I know.
[94:11.12]There's another weird graphical problem again.
[94:13.19]Uh... No, I think she... Mm-hmm.
[94:17.41]You know?
[94:17.77]God, I missed you.
[94:19.33]I miss you, too.
[94:23.62]How come you get a love interest?
[94:25.78]Because.
[94:29.14]Is this when I tell her that she's going to smuggle a wrench out of here?
[94:32.26]Good.
[94:33.58]What can I do?
[94:34.70]She's going to have to eat it.
[94:36.02]So I hand the wrench off to her and she leaves the wrench, right?
[94:39.26]And then the plan, she now has the wrench and she can fix something.
[94:42.63]That was bad.
[94:45.97]I'm sorry.
[94:46.41]That was fucking bad.
[94:47.29]Forget about that one.
[94:48.97]Delete that one from the VOD.
[94:57.18]I don't know yet.
[94:58.48]But I'll find out.
[94:59.42]What if it turns out I'm Harvey?
[95:00.86]Okay.
[95:01.14]You know what?
[95:04.18]Thank you for spoiling the entire game.
[95:06.16]How's Alex?
[95:07.40]That's what it is.
[95:07.78]Well, it's been six months.
[95:09.66]He misses his father.
[95:11.82]Shit.
[95:13.22]I miss him, Linda.
[95:15.61]You are Harvey.
[95:17.27]Has he found out?
[95:19.21]We haven't seen anyone named Harvey.
[95:20.77]It's fine.
[95:21.19]He still thinks you're in Italy helping your uncle.
[95:24.29]Good, good.
[95:26.74]Good call.
[95:27.06]All right, but if it's true, then I want the timer to show I solved it in an hour and a half.
[95:33.92]Yeah.
[95:35.67]And for me, I just have not been paying attention to anything since we started the game.
[95:42.63]I don't even know what my character's name is.
[95:45.07]I know I'm Vincent.
[95:47.71]Okay, you're Vincent.
[95:48.62]I don't know who I am.
[95:49.78]I thought I may have been somebody named Vincent, but it'd be... So I'm abstained from all that because I wasn't paying any attention to the story.
[95:57.44]I'd like to make a phone call, sir.
[95:59.31]Let's go.
[96:00.17]Really?
[96:00.39]I like how I'm just wistfully watching you have a relationship.
[96:04.99]Yeah.
[96:05.43]Oh.
[96:05.87]Carol.
[96:06.69]I got a baby on the way.
[96:07.97]Here comes the name.
[96:08.59]Because I'm at home expecting our baby.
[96:10.74]Harvey.
[96:11.34]Please.
[96:12.48]We've talked about this.
[96:14.20]No, you've talked about this.
[96:15.86]No, it'd be funny if she was like, no, you've talked about this, 03465.
[96:18.00]I'll be out soon.
[96:20.31]Listen to yourself, Vincent.
[96:22.11]This isn't who you are.
[96:23.79]Is this how you want your future child to remember you?
[96:25.95]Don't hang that over my head.
[96:26.55]You know I was framed.
[96:27.03]No, listen to me.
[96:27.43]0-3-4-6-5.
[96:27.53]This is your son.
[96:37.66]Come on, that was good.
[96:40.32]Was that a good one?
[96:40.96]Tell me the truth.
[96:42.25]You talking to me?
[96:45.11]Yeah.
[96:45.47]I was reading my character's backstory.
[96:47.65]You weren't paying attention to the absolutely fucking hysterical joke that I just made?
[96:52.05]You know, you don't make the jokes for me, okay?
[96:54.03]You make the jokes for Chad.
[96:54.97]Yeah, but you would have thought that was funny.
[97:00.13]What was the joke?
[97:01.41]You know, we'll just pretend like you didn't hear it.
[97:02.93]It's okay.
[97:03.94]There's no pretending necessary.
[97:05.98]I was saying that if she was yelling at you and calling you 03465.
[97:08.04]Oh.
[97:08.70]Like, I don't think so, 03465.
[97:12.09]That's not how we did it.
[97:12.99]Like, that's your name tag.
[97:13.85]That's your name.
[97:14.39]So, like, the joke is that that's been my name the whole game?
[97:18.31]The joke is that that's just your guy's actual name.
[97:21.01]Because I don't have a name tag.
[97:22.19]There's a storm coming.
[97:23.43]I did.
[97:23.69]It's our window.
[97:25.73]We'll leave tonight.
[97:26.90]Here we go.
[97:27.22]Time to get up.
[97:28.32]How long has it been?
[97:29.00]We've been playing for an hour and a half?
[97:34.88]The game's a little shorter than I anticipated.
[97:36.61]It's a little bit quicker.
[97:37.47]No, it's not.
[97:37.97]Because once we get out, that's when we do the big police chase.
[97:39.91]By the way, have we talked about the one selling point of this game yet?
[97:42.81]No.
[97:43.01]What is it?
[97:44.39]That only one person has to buy it.
[97:45.77]Oh, that's right.
[97:46.91]And that I'm mooching off of Jerma right now.
[97:50.84]Yeah, weirdly enough, guys, a lot of you probably already know this, but those of you that don't, only one person has to own this game if you play with somebody you know.
[98:01.23]You can invite anybody, and only one of you has to own it.
[98:04.21]It's crazy.
[98:06.45]And it's by EA, of all people.
[98:10.67]Yeah, so... The game's $30.
[98:14.01]If you, like, went in half... How did we get back up here, by the way?
[98:18.35]Oh, okay, we climbed back up here.
[98:21.49]Okay, yeah, that was just a... Yeah, that's it.
[98:26.27]It's $15 a person if you kind of go in, like, you PayPal your friend or something like that.
[98:30.54]It's crazy.
[98:35.71]I guess we're just opening this up.
[98:39.01]Yeah.
[98:41.89]Jump down, please.
[98:43.31]I can't.
[98:44.01]There's no jump off button.
[98:47.19]Thanks, bud.
[98:50.25]Yeah, it is made by the Fuck the Oscars guy.
[98:52.29]That's true.
[98:53.53]That is true, too, yeah.
[98:59.48]All right.
[99:00.06]You ready to do this?
[99:01.10]We're breaking out.
[99:02.34]Yep.
[99:04.07]breaking in three two one gonna get caught immediately well this is the first act of the game right you have to assume I can't believe I'm out of this shit hole soon it's not over until the fat lady sinks the the average play time of this game is what like six to eight hours five to six hours depending on depending how much you goof off I mean well we've been doing some goofing so
[99:33.58]uh over here I heard around six hours is what I sounds about I remember okay anything we I guess this box is here you're like the push the car I know I I like pushing around stuff all right there's a great right here you're probably gonna have to jump on this all right get on it hey last of us am I right guys
[100:02.07]No, we both can't do this at the same time.
[100:07.05]You would've just broke my nose.
[100:10.11]Ah, what the hell?
[100:12.97]I wanna be the dog that goes out, you know, like when you open up your... Do you have more than one dog?
[100:18.88]Not for me, but my dog has been in the presence of other dogs.
[100:23.71]Right.
[100:24.25]Who have been trying to go in the door at the exact same time.
[100:26.29]Exactly.
[100:26.71]And then one of those dogs is the alpha that is so desperate and has to go out first and has to come in first.
[100:31.57]Right?
[100:32.49]Mm-hmm.
[100:32.99]That's me.
[100:35.30]I don't know about that.
[100:35.84]I think I might be the alpha dog.
[100:37.44]I don't know.
[100:37.88]I just clearly beat you there.
[100:39.84]But I punched a guy in the face earlier.
[100:41.40]Twice.
[100:41.52]How come you always get the aces?
[100:43.30]Two times in a row.
[100:44.64]Watch out.
[100:45.04]We got guards here.
[100:53.19]So this is when we finally sneak out and then you give me up to the police.
[100:59.39]Did we just go?
[101:00.13]I don't... I think we just go.
[101:01.21]Yeah, I guess we just go.
[101:04.26]We're both trying to open it.
[101:08.54]It's the same situation over here.
[101:17.28]Think about this for a second.
[101:18.35]Just go.
[101:18.87]Time it with a thunder.
[101:19.71]Okay, sure.
[101:23.38]How are we supposed to time the thunder?
[101:24.61]It doesn't seem to matter.
[101:31.93]I know, I know.
[101:33.55]I know what thunder is.
[101:34.77]Oh, right.
[101:35.35]No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[101:37.61]Ready?
[101:39.41]Watch for the lightning.
[101:40.51]Yeah, I am.
[101:40.99]Thunder comes after lightning.
[101:42.41]Yeah, do you count one Mississippi, two Marie?
[101:47.18]One Mississippi, two Mississippi.
[101:49.44]That's how far away it is.
[101:50.76]Stop it!
[101:54.17]No.
[101:55.53]I think the guard on the left actually is me.
[101:58.39]Don't go.
[101:59.53]No, that's me.
[102:02.67]That guard on the left.
[102:08.33]You took too long.
[102:10.95]I was just enamored.
[102:17.42]We're very dependent on this Thunder right now.
[102:19.32]Yes, we are.
[102:19.60]And their card game.
[102:21.08]Got it.
[102:30.47]At first second, I was gonna make the joke, that's where we're gonna go, but that's where they are going.
[102:39.94]You see that tower over there, Vincent?
[102:41.36]Yeah, you can go there.
[102:43.18]You can go there.
[102:46.62]Yeah, you think of the same thing.
[102:48.74]I'm glad.
[102:57.44]Combat.
[102:58.10]First combat of the night.
[102:58.94]Over there.
[103:03.28]Through the warden's office.
[103:06.86]Why are we running like this?
[103:08.18]We are sneak running very fast.
[103:13.58]Same deal like last time, yep.
[103:15.10]Okay.
[103:15.78]Been here, done that.
[103:16.98]Come on, over here.
[103:17.56]Dude, you should- I don't know how this goes.
[103:23.06]Why didn't you just grip my neck and flip me up with you?
[103:26.28]With your legs.
[103:29.45]I'm coming back for you this time.
[103:30.46]What do you mean?
[103:30.80]Like a circus act.
[103:31.60]Why didn't we do that?
[103:35.66]Leave no man behind.
[103:36.66]You just awkwardly went in for the shake hug and I just totally, totally didn't let it happen.
[103:41.90]Wow.
[103:43.34]Go, go, go!
[103:44.42]I still feel loved.
[103:45.20]Alright, be careful.
[103:49.95]The thing's gonna be shining on us probably here soon.
[103:53.85]There's only one guard up here.
[103:56.25]Wait till he turns the light.
[103:57.09]He's coming back around.
[103:57.91]Wait for the light.
[103:59.27]They have a big spotlight.
[104:03.21]Oh, fuck.
[104:03.59]He went.
[104:04.33]I gotta go.
[104:06.93]Oh, here he comes.
[104:08.01]Here he comes.
[104:11.53]Your head's popping up, man.
[104:12.89]Shit.
[104:13.25]Did we go around the side?
[104:14.19]Uh-oh.
[104:14.81]He's doing a figure eight.
[104:16.05]Go, go, go.
[104:16.51]Right to the right.
[104:16.93]To the right.
[104:17.57]Wait, you can take him down.
[104:19.05]Take him down.
[104:19.41]Quick.
[104:20.23]Take him down.
[104:21.61]Don't move.
[104:23.05]On the ground now.
[104:24.25]I can't compete with teleporting guards.
[104:25.46]Stay there.
[104:27.75]Oh, he blew the whistle.
[104:29.07]He was right behind me the whole time.
[104:32.07]God damn it.
[104:34.13]Look, I didn't know he could... I thought the whole flashlight thing was as long as the Flash Knight's not... Why even have the flashlight if he doesn't need it?
[104:39.86]As long as the Dark Knight, you know, the Flash Knight.
[104:43.20]You said as long as the Flash Knight.
[104:47.28]Yeah, motherfucker.
[104:47.92]Oh, yeah, you're going out.
[104:49.00]You're going out like a light.
[104:50.30]You understand?
[104:51.48]Can you breathe?
[104:52.27]Oh, no, you can't.
[104:53.25]All right, we ended already?
[104:56.45]You just let him go.
[104:58.24]He's dead.
[104:59.78]I'm a murderer, remember?
[105:00.92]There's a guy on the roof over here.
[105:01.96]Be careful.
[105:02.56]Over there.
[105:03.56]From the warden's office.
[105:14.95]Come on.
[105:15.45]Over here.
[105:17.10]All right.
[105:17.44]This time... Sheath's katana.
[105:20.72]This time, we're going to move together.
[105:23.18]Are you reading italicized...
[105:27.06]I just saw RP.
[105:28.66]Because you just read it out of context.
[105:34.04]It was in the chat.
[105:35.12]You literally just read unsheathed katana, but I have no knowledge about what you're talking about, so I just hear you say unsheathed katana.
[105:40.56]So you can't just pretend that that's me doing that?
[105:42.62]Yeah.
[105:43.92]So why can't you pretend like I'm putting the italics sides?
[105:46.86]I'm using you as cover right now.
[105:56.40]Oh, shit.
[106:02.16]Can we be seen here?
[106:03.32]I feel like we can.
[106:03.92]I mean... No, we definitely can't.
[106:05.97]We have to wait.
[106:06.61]We have to wait until he chooses, which I think he's going to do the figure eight again.
[106:10.05]And then as he does, we have to sneak around the side.
[106:12.91]All right.
[106:14.23]If you start seeing his meter fill up, you need to... Oh, God.
[106:17.53]Okay.
[106:18.53]Take cover.
[106:19.51]Here we come.
[106:20.47]We got to get to that ladder.
[106:21.43]He's coming over here.
[106:22.31]He's on his way.
[106:22.89]He's right here.
[106:25.43]there's no way like what are you supposed to do no all right we have to go one at a time we have to go one at a time you have to how does he keep catching me I was taking cover behind us so here's what has to happen you you go first you have to wrap around and knock him out because I'm I'm causing a problem because we're both stacking in the same spot
[106:52.56]No, that was quick.
[106:54.02]That was a throat punch.
[106:58.32]Yeah, so you just go, you take out the guard by doing the stealthy ring around the Rosie thing.
[107:09.83]Just give me a cardboard box, you know?
[107:20.11]I'm like 50% sure you... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[107:24.76]We might not be going the right way.
[107:26.90]Oh.
[107:27.46]Well, then why does it let us go up there?
[107:29.14]Maybe this is a secret collectible.
[107:31.46]Oh my god.
[107:32.06]Okay, yeah.
[107:33.47]It's been this the entire time.
[107:35.43]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[107:36.53]Was I supposed to do that?
[107:40.43]I think so.
[107:41.77]Alright, like, rifle through all this shit.
[107:43.95]I'm gonna pee in his briefcase.
[107:44.72]So you tell me if anybody's coming.
[107:50.33]Alright, I think we're good.
[107:51.07]Is this where we kill the warden?
[107:55.58]You know how you can pick up the telephone and make a phone call?
[108:01.40]Let's prank call somebody.
[108:04.42]What did I just do?
[108:05.36]I broke the phone.
[108:05.96]That's right.
[108:06.36]Quick, pick up the phone and make a call.
[108:17.94]I've never been to Asia.
[108:19.84]Maybe I'll go there once this is all over.
[108:21.74]What are you doing?
[108:23.46]Shit.
[108:24.94]I've never been to Asia.
[108:27.08]I'm like, I'm talking to you.
[108:28.36]Oh, I'm about to escape prison.
[108:32.73]There's a record player.
[108:37.17]Who's in the warden's office, just like he said.
[108:39.25]I think there's people down here.
[108:48.87]Where did you even go?
[108:49.85]I went down.
[108:50.29]I went through the stairs.
[108:51.13]I went down the stairs.
[108:52.22]Alright, this is where he snuck out.
[108:55.72]I was learning geography.
[108:59.20]So should we go down or?
[109:00.42]I don't know.
[109:06.33]We've been wrong to date.
[109:08.19]This is the right way.
[109:08.85]Let's hug the wall.
[109:13.43]And listen to the funny conversation that the NPCs have.
[109:16.33]Alright, so here's what's gonna happen.
[109:18.51]Okay, so... I'm gonna take the guy on the left, you take the guy on the right.
[109:22.43]Okay?
[109:23.09]No, I'll take the... Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
[109:25.16]Okay.
[109:26.20]Ready?
[109:28.12]You get the guy on the right.
[109:31.12]Ready?
[109:31.42]One, two, three.
[109:33.26]That's how you do it.
[109:39.79]Uh, you want a cigarette?
[109:41.35]No.
[109:42.76]Oh, oh, I see.
[109:43.40]I thought there was a window there.
[109:52.41]Get to the tower.
[109:54.17]Just don't get seen by the light.
[109:59.29]Oh wait, we gotta do it to the, uh, thunder.
[110:00.45]Yeah.
[110:03.85]That's what it said.
[110:04.27]Yeah, ready?
[110:11.95]Spotlight's, like, right here.
[110:13.04]Wait for the thunder.
[110:16.34]That was lightning.
[110:18.60]Go.
[110:22.46]Shit.
[110:23.60]Better avoid the searchlight.
[110:26.12]I made it.
[110:28.43]How much does that guy get paid up there to just turn the spotlight back and forth on the roof?
[110:32.37]I feel like you could really get that into automation.
[110:35.19]Somebody, you could have, like, a robot deter it, like, go determine if there's movement or not.
[110:41.11]Alright, get ready.
[110:42.11]Hold on.
[110:51.35]What?
[110:51.75]Oh, watch out!
[110:52.85]I'm stuck on you.
[110:53.51]There we go.
[110:54.35]You're good.
[110:54.79]You're good.
[110:55.23]That was a little glitchy.
[110:56.43]Alright, where's the next hidey spot?
[110:58.56]Uh, the next hidey spot looks like it's just kind of underneath.
[111:00.86]Is it on my side?
[111:01.62]It's over here.
[111:03.38]To the right, maybe?
[111:03.98]Over here?
[111:05.00]I think we just have to get over there and just use whatever hidey spot you can.
[111:16.67]I'm fine.
[111:17.45]Just a shoe.
[111:17.95]Don't worry.
[111:18.23]Nothing suspicious.
[111:24.40]I'm going to get ready to run here.
[111:25.30]I'm on the move.
[111:28.24]Careful.
[111:30.58]I've just walked out.
[111:33.25]Don't really know where to go next.
[111:36.29]I think we have to get in the tower and knock the guy out.
[111:43.01]Okay.
[111:43.36]It's fine.
[111:44.76]It's fine.
[111:47.50]You're up there, huh?
[111:48.80]I am up there.
[111:54.14]I'm fine.
[111:55.83]It's all good?
[111:56.33]I think I'm okay here.
[111:58.57]I'm underneath the light right now, right?
[111:59.83]There's like a place you could jump up right in front of you.
[112:02.75]Now we just have to get up the ladder.
[112:06.93]Good luck.
[112:07.35]Which I assume he can't see us from here.
[112:08.81]Well, from here he can.
[112:10.39]We have to jump over the pipes?
[112:15.40]Oh, that scared the absolute hell out of me.
[112:17.10]Okay, he can't.
[112:18.54]Okay, let's do the same thing you just did.
[112:21.71]Oh, wait.
[112:22.09]Going up.
[112:24.39]Can you take care of him?
[112:25.89]Working on it.
[112:28.35]He doesn't even know.
[112:30.31]Don't follow it.
[112:35.63]Excellent work.
[112:38.09]I want to be the guy.
[112:40.45]What if you turn it off and point it at me?
[112:41.37]There we go, I turned the light off.
[112:43.06]I just pointed right at you and sound the alarm.
[112:45.00]There he is.
[112:46.00]He's trying to get away.
[112:48.22]We can use that wire.
[112:49.70]We just need something to slide down with.
[112:51.46]Alright, ready for some extreme sports?
[112:55.80]Extreme sports.
[112:58.08]Dream sports.
[112:59.62]Is there like an old sock in here or something?
[113:01.49]It's a banjo.
[113:03.93]What is this?
[113:05.89]Perfect.
[113:06.83]A hanger.
[113:08.49]I just rearranged his desk.
[113:11.91]Okay.
[113:13.77]I like to go wrong.
[113:15.59]It seems perfectly safe.
[113:18.30]Damn, that's pretty high.
[113:21.70]Like, so much confidence to do that.
[113:24.58]Yeah.
[113:25.80]I mean, that would be kind of fun if it was secure.
[113:28.66]With a coat hanger?
[113:30.28]If it was secure, not a coat hanger.
[113:31.74]If it was a ride at Disney... No.
[113:38.97]Well, that... Okay.
[113:40.71]Okay.
[113:43.11]You're strong.
[113:44.03]Don't worry, Captain America is here.
[113:46.77]Where the hamburgers are tasty.
[113:48.30]Somebody's shooting at you.
[113:51.64]Come on.
[113:53.66]Use that statue strength.
[113:56.66]I'm coming.
[114:00.08]Hey, we made it.
[114:01.50]We're gonna get shot.
[114:07.23]No.
[114:07.43]That didn't seem like a smart idea.
[114:13.27]Okay, we're fine.
[114:18.10]Open the grate.
[114:21.68]Same deal.
[114:22.78]Quick, zigzag.
[114:26.56]We're just cockroaches right now.
[114:28.54]This is turning into a different game.
[114:42.66]You okay back there?
[114:44.24]Where are you?
[114:44.78]I can't- Oh god damn it!
[114:50.03]I knew you were gonna do that.
[114:51.07]I was trying to get a shot in the head.
[114:53.39]I was trying to get a shot in the head.
[115:00.81]We're right here, it doesn't matter.
[115:03.71]Go go go!
[115:04.23]Come on, if I could just shoot it was like- Don't stop!
[115:07.58]Trust me.
[115:08.74]I've got no intention to stop.
[115:12.96]Every time we have stopped, the line right before it is, I have no intention of stopping.
[115:17.77]Yeah.
[115:20.11]Three for three now.
[115:21.29]We're just playing Monster Hunter World.
[115:24.81]It's the exact same gameplay.
[115:28.35]Oh, Lord.
[115:29.75]Hey, Monster Hunter World's a pretty good game.
[115:31.57]I'll give you one second.
[115:32.97]Edgemont.
[115:34.49]Thanks a lot, Edgemont.
[115:35.23]$50 from Edgemont.
[115:39.53]Coming in saying, hey, Jerma, I'm currently at work right now, so sadly I'm not able to watch the stream.
[115:43.09]Hope you guys are having fun.
[115:44.07]Looking forward to watching the VOD.
[115:45.18]Say hi to Italics for me.
[115:46.70]L-U-L.
[115:48.98]Thank you so much, dude.
[115:51.84]That is a lot of money.
[115:53.88]That you have given to me many times.
[115:55.88]Thank you so much, man.
[115:57.92]Yeah.
[115:58.02]What about it?
[116:04.28]Alright, you know the thing, uh, the total biscuit laughing?
[116:07.26]What is that called?
[116:09.70]The what?
[116:10.22]The total biscuit laughing emote.
[116:11.68]What is that just called?
[116:12.52]What do you call it?
[116:13.94]L-U-L.
[116:14.74]L-U-L, okay.
[116:16.68]All caps.
[116:17.88]Yeah, but like, how would you say that in a conversation?
[116:20.74]I would say lol.
[116:21.48]You'd say lol.
[116:22.38]You wouldn't say L-U-L.
[116:23.28]No.
[116:24.20]Okay, wise.
[116:26.16]You having an argument with Chad about that?
[116:27.64]No, no, I just, I just, I may have misspoke.
[116:29.93]I said L-U-L.
[116:32.57]Are you being chastised and made fun of?
[116:34.56]No.
[116:35.88]Here.
[116:36.52]Because you should be.
[116:39.18]Come on.
[116:39.74]There.
[116:40.58]All right.
[116:41.24]All right, where are the tracks?
[116:42.70]We need to smell the ground.
[116:43.75]The chopper?
[116:44.81]Yeah.
[116:45.75]Seems like we've really pissed him off.
[116:47.49]But to be fair, though, do you say um?
[116:49.85]No, you say OMG?
[116:51.31]I'm not going back in.
[116:52.53]Find Vincent.
[116:54.17]What do you mean, find Vincent?
[116:56.04]Oh, I think we have to stay right next to each other.
[117:03.60]Oh, hang on.
[117:04.10]There's two paths here.
[117:06.12]Two paths?
[117:07.16]Yeah, there's a path to the left and a path to the right.
[117:09.02]Then we should separate then.
[117:11.64]Right.
[117:12.40]Okay.
[117:15.50]Currently climbing some rocks.
[117:16.40]It's a race now.
[117:21.28]You're going to come from that way.
[117:22.70]Yeah, you should not have gone that way.
[117:26.10]It was way faster.
[117:30.39]Here we go one two three make it smooth.
[117:33.29]You could have made it smooth.
[117:34.75]Why are you the boost guy?
[117:36.39]I just am You have a really like Thick shoulder, you know so I can step on it every single time split up and search for clues Wait there are cops everywhere keep your head down yeah, yeah How'd they get here before us though?
[117:55.14]We're the ones escaping
[117:57.01]They probably have a squad that's just out there.
[117:59.77]Or maybe they're having a camp.
[118:00.53]Yeah, but if they have a squad of, like, canine units, we're done.
[118:04.43]But they don't, though.
[118:04.97]This is like the 1970s.
[118:06.65]What year does this game take place in?
[118:08.97]70s, 80s?
[118:10.23]These cups are dumber than a bag of white potatoes.
[118:12.93]So we have to stop moving in the bushes.
[118:15.11]Just like in Monster Hunter World.
[118:16.94]I know, right?
[118:17.42]That's what I'm saying.
[118:17.94]There's another one right over here to the right.
[118:20.06]All right.
[118:25.88]How are we going to play this?
[118:27.89]We're gonna play wait for the flashlight to go away and then make a break make a break Are we gonna hide in the bush I'm going oh that I'm scared.
[118:40.62]I didn't move Hope you I'm not gonna get seen I'm hiding in the bush right I can't be seen in the bush That is that is the theory.
[118:47.69]That's a theory working theory.
[118:49.21]There's nobody here.
[118:50.25]Would you go all the way down to the bottom?
[118:51.71]Oh?
[118:51.83]No, I'm scared.
[118:52.75]I'm terrified right now.
[118:53.47]I don't want to do.
[118:54.25]I don't know what to do
[119:00.51]I can probably take this guy out.
[119:02.61]He's coming down your way.
[119:08.50]What?
[119:10.50]Oh, shit.
[119:11.32]I got like two or three cops on me right now.
[119:14.18]Can I just jump and do L1?
[119:15.52]Or R1?
[119:16.30]And smash him?
[119:18.80]Oh my god, thank god he's going that way.
[119:20.24]You are kind of in no man's land right now.
[119:21.90]Yeah, I really am.
[119:24.45]I'm in the bush.
[119:24.93]Alright, I'm fine.
[119:26.05]I'm gonna take this guy out.
[119:30.10]Yeah, that's one guy down.
[119:33.83]Somebody hear that?
[119:35.97]They're gonna find the body.
[119:37.51]No, they're not smart in this game like in Hitman 2.
[119:42.81]Can you do anything?
[119:43.53]Can you take anybody out or no?
[119:48.33]Got one.
[119:48.73]Good.
[119:51.84]Why are we just hunting people right now?
[119:53.24]Where are we supposed to be going?
[119:54.62]We're just hunting them.
[119:55.90]Alright, I'm here at the co-op moment.
[119:57.22]You're here at the co-op moment?
[119:58.44]Alright, I better get there then.
[120:04.15]There's the guy I took out, so if you go past him... There's another guy back here.
[120:08.77]You were pretty far away, actually.
[120:11.03]Yeah, I think I'm too far away to do a co-op moment right now.
[120:13.99]Yeah, you got to figure your stuff out first.
[120:16.55]I'm in front of you.
[120:17.31]Yeah, I'm in front of you.
[120:19.61]No, you're not.
[120:20.17]I'm not in front of you?
[120:21.27]You're behind me.
[120:22.43]I'm definitely at the co-op moment.
[120:24.29]All right, well, hold on.
[120:25.05]I got to get to the co-op moment.
[120:26.05]Just hang out there.
[120:27.21]There's two guards back here.
[120:32.48]I see where you are.
[120:33.36]Alright, I should be able to get there now.
[120:38.60]Okay, hold on.
[120:43.48]Okay, he's not looking this way.
[120:51.30]Where?
[120:51.92]Oh, you're right here.
[120:52.84]Okay.
[120:53.70]Hi.
[120:55.20]Oh, hi there.
[120:55.76]Don't do the co-op moment yet.
[120:56.76]We're waiting for these guys to... It's okay.
[121:01.81]I need to get, we need to hydrate.
[121:03.51]No, if it's right, I have to hide.
[121:05.85]Uh, we need to hydrate?
[121:07.29]Yeah, there's a bot on Twitch where if you don't drink water in like two hours, it hates you.
[121:11.39]Yeah, I banned that guy.
[121:14.11]I banned that guy.
[121:17.63]Well, there you go.
[121:19.53]Wait, there's a guy aiming a flashlight down here.
[121:21.43]Are you ready?
[121:21.85]No, there's a guy aiming a flashlight right here.
[121:25.38]He's looking up in the trees.
[121:26.50]He thinks there's some kind of owl.
[121:27.46]I'll take the guy on the right.
[121:28.50]You get the guy on the left.
[121:29.76]Okay.
[121:30.60]One, two, three.
[121:33.52]Over the edge.
[121:38.38]Wow.
[121:38.72]Lay them down to sleep.
[121:39.36]Gently place them down.
[121:42.72]I'm going to dry out now.
[121:45.56]I'm going to cough and ash is going to come out of my mouth.
[121:48.62]There are a lot.
[122:00.53]Guy coming up here on the right.
[122:01.97]Can we just steal their car?
[122:03.69]We might be.
[122:04.67]Remember, what's the golden rule?
[122:06.23]If there's a drivable car in a video game, it automatically gets plus one letter grade higher.
[122:11.45]So we'll find out.
[122:12.15]So like from a B to an A or a C to a B?
[122:14.57]If we can actually drive that car and go wherever we want, this goes from a B to an A. That's just a fact in video games.
[122:21.60]There's a lot of shotgun wielding police officers here.
[122:25.06]I don't think that's safe.
[122:33.67]This guy can definitely be taken out.
[122:39.61]I'm over there, buddy.
[122:45.37]I saw an opportunity, and I had to take it.
[122:47.87]Why do you get, like, the back of the neck punch, and I get, like, the lullaby sleeper?
[122:56.20]It's just different play styles, man.
[122:57.56]We're different personalities.
[123:00.53]Play the game through once, you can play it through again as the other character.
[123:03.13]It's a different game.
[123:06.17]You know you could.
[123:08.53]I don't think you will, though.
[123:11.13]Some people might.
[123:14.81]Uh, excuse me.
[123:15.41]Connection, excuse me.
[123:16.45]Why are you orange right now?
[123:17.57]Uh-oh.
[123:18.27]Uh-oh.
[123:20.73]Save as.
[123:21.47]New save game.
[123:22.07]Quick save.
[123:22.89]We'll have to cross that bridge.
[123:24.67]No shit, Sherlock.
[123:27.05]What?
[123:28.11]Pause a little too long after the no shit there.
[123:30.39]No shit's your luck.
[123:31.63]Oh, there.
[123:32.13]Thank you.
[123:33.75]See, they're talking about it, right?
[123:35.19]Just give them a moment.
[123:36.25]They thought about that.
[123:36.89]How long do you think we'll be out here?
[123:38.18]Whoever long it takes for us to catch a dead fugitive.
[123:41.08]Who's the transgressor in that?
[123:42.44]I don't know, but... Is that me that said it wrong, or you?
[123:46.76]I'm not sure, but I'm afraid to go up there.
[123:50.62]Don't do this.
[123:52.02]Get out of your inside of you right now.
[123:53.48]We're playing Twister on the rock.
[123:55.79]Somebody spin it.
[123:56.51]What is it?
[123:56.79]Oh, blue.
[123:57.73]It's on blue.
[123:58.43]Hand blue.
[123:59.83]Oh, shit.
[124:00.43]Oh, this is getting so awkward.
[124:03.22]Oh, spin the wheel again.
[124:05.80]Red foot?
[124:07.86]Oh, wow.
[124:09.02]I touched your leg.
[124:09.98]Oh, shit.
[124:13.59]Okay.
[124:15.87]Yeah, it was.
[124:26.47]And red foot.
[124:29.11]All right, you do the, I'll get this guy.
[124:31.31]Okay.
[124:33.77]When are they gonna make another Splinter Cell game?
[124:35.99]Never.
[124:38.03]That has good co-op.
[124:39.03]All right, so I think I gotta... You ready?
[124:43.45]You just have to time it.
[124:44.69]Ready, I'm going in now.
[124:48.40]I was gonna say, why are you not moving?
[124:55.08]Just kidding, I'm not running.
[124:58.55]Why can't we just pick up his gun?
[125:01.69]That guy had a gun.
[125:03.39]Yeah, you would wonder why we can't do that.
[125:12.03]My turn to be the boost.
[125:14.31]It actually is, huh?
[125:14.97]Hold my hand.
[125:17.49]Oh, they got co-ops.
[125:19.07]There's fucking co-ops up here.
[125:21.91]Co-op co-ops?
[125:22.39]Alright, I'm gonna go after rain jacket co-op.
[125:25.71]How did I get up?
[125:26.94]I don't know.
[125:30.10]I don't need you.
[125:31.76]Man, they brought in a great mechanic of throw utensils at people and then brought it back.
[125:38.41]Hey, you know what?
[125:39.23]We're only a third through the game.
[125:40.77]That could come back.
[125:41.57]Take his car.
[125:42.37]Take his car.
[125:42.77]Take his car.
[125:49.26]Woah woah, decision making.
[125:50.30]Oh wait a minute, we've got a decision here.
[125:54.44]Go over the bridge Leo's way, go under the bridge Vincent's way.
[125:58.70]Under the bridge.
[125:59.42]Aren't you the one scared of heights?
[126:01.56]Why are you suggesting to go over the bridge if you're scared of heights?
[126:06.05]There's a car on top of the bridge.
[126:07.75]Yeah, so we're gonna go over the bridge.
[126:09.35]It's more likely.
[126:10.29]I mean, do you want the game to get a full letter grade higher?
[126:14.79]I mean, I kinda do.
[126:19.76]Look at this replay value.
[126:20.84]Why is this guy Captain Morgan?
[126:22.34]What the hell are you doing?
[126:23.56]He's gonna catch you in a second.
[126:24.58]Wow, he is.
[126:30.38]I was just taking an Instagram photo from somebody across the way.
[126:33.30]We better get out of here.
[126:34.12]Here we go, alright.
[126:34.75]Alright, here we go.
[126:36.41]Is this a... And ladies and gentlemen, we have now figured out that the game gets a full letter grade higher.
[126:42.41]Come on, move, move, move already.
[126:52.68]Really you go on really?
[126:54.82]Are you serious?
[126:58.52]The guy dives out of the way in the last second and you can't let me run a guy over with a car Go full speed Baby on board in the back
[127:25.25]Oh no!
[127:32.30]We did it!
[127:34.08]Why did I let you drive?
[127:35.60]Two guys dove off the bridge by the way.
[127:38.56]They would have rather jumped off.
[127:45.77]No, the full letter grade still stands, but what the hell?
[127:47.69]You can go very fast, or you can try to stealth by everybody, I guess.
[127:50.01]Where are you?
[127:50.57]Oh, you're ahead of me.
[127:51.39]Oh, he got me.
[128:16.08]I'm getting eaten by dog!
[128:21.68]Oh, now we're gonna do the, uh, the bobsled.
[128:23.34]We're gonna do the scene from, like, the trailer.
[128:34.06]I love that scream.
[128:36.60]Oh, the dog's got me!
[128:39.03]The dog!
[128:43.68]You fell down the whole thing.
[128:45.70]You did not jump.
[128:47.38]There's no fucking way.
[128:50.24]You fell down feet first, and then you fell down.
[128:53.42]Oh, we need to hold on to the button here.
[129:03.95]Watch your guy's side.
[129:05.57]Seriously, watch your guy's camera.
[129:07.59]It's fucking hilarious.
[129:09.23]Look at what happened.
[129:09.85]Look at this animation.
[129:10.47]Just right here.
[129:10.99]Watch what happens.
[129:24.03]Watch though, this is for real.
[129:25.19]Watch what happens to your guy.
[129:26.85]Watch what he does.
[129:29.59]I got it, man.
[129:30.31]I'm a gymnast.
[129:31.27]You get hit by a Super Mario 64 wind gust.
[129:36.17]Alright, grab.
[129:41.87]Okay, we're good.
[129:43.67]Wait, hold on.
[129:45.85]I knew there was one more.
[129:47.23]I didn't think there was one more.
[129:49.07]I thought you just had to get it full.
[129:52.28]Oh, my God.
[129:53.72]Just that, like, going up with the... Oh, my Lord, that was fucking sad.
[129:59.39]He almost had us.
[130:00.27]I didn't know you had to keep holding.
[130:01.37]I thought you just had to get it full, and then you could let go.
[130:06.71]God damn it, man.
[130:14.46]The queen's gemstone.
[130:15.78]I love that.
[130:16.82]Your feet go, you fall all the way down halfway, and then you just gust up and fly.
[130:21.86]Where the hell are we?
[130:23.60]Is that Harvey?
[130:29.85]I don't even know what's happening right now.
[130:33.07]We're moving around.
[130:34.87]By the way, you don't need a briefcase that big for that little hole there.
[130:38.17]I'm on the right.
[130:39.25]What the hell?
[130:40.09]Are you kidding me?
[130:41.80]Just get it in a small case.
[130:43.30]You don't need it in a gigantic briefcase.
[130:46.54]So you can handcuff it to your arm to make sure it doesn't get stolen.
[130:49.54]They could have put that in a shoebox and it would have been fine.
[130:52.96]But it's invaluable.
[130:54.00]Look, take the deal or stop wasting my time.
[130:57.46]Alright?
[130:58.36]Yeah.
[131:01.48]What's up?
[131:02.90]Leo busted out of prison.
[131:04.40]What?
[131:05.36]Leo busted out of prison?
[131:07.98]Our guy fucked up.
[131:09.02]Got himself killed by the guards.
[131:10.60]Good for nothing, piece of shit.
[131:12.68]Sorry, boss.
[131:13.66]Look, Sean.
[131:14.95]You need to find him.
[131:16.55]Okay?
[131:17.41]Yeah, but I'm not sure the men we have right now are gonna... Not my problem.
[131:20.67]You just need to find him.
[131:21.95]You got it?
[131:22.79]I don't give a fuck how.
[131:24.09]Just make it happen.
[131:25.25]Yes, boss.
[131:28.16]I can't even get over it.
[131:29.60]Alright, do I get to choose?
[131:35.87]I didn't do that, but I guess I chose for him.
[131:37.39]Oh, wait, that was supposed to be us.
[131:39.31]Why did I get to choose?
[131:39.85]That was me.
[131:41.49]What?
[131:41.91]That was not you.
[131:42.53]That was probably the Harvey bad guy character.
[131:56.58]Harvey Bad Guy was just me.
[131:58.15]That was me.
[131:58.53]See?
[131:58.61]Lookit.
[131:59.57]He dyed it.
[131:59.93]He dyed it.
[132:00.27]Okay, he dyed it.
[132:00.77]He dyed his hair.
[132:16.52]Not sure if genuine confusion or just unfunny joke.
[132:21.74]I don't know which.
[132:22.28]We'll see.
[132:22.52]Don't worry, we'll see.
[132:23.36]I'm so hungry.
[132:23.92]Why is my guy obsessed with cheeseburgers?
[132:25.29]I mean, aren't you, in a way?
[132:26.55]That's true.
[132:46.74]This is... Well, this is... Let's take a moment here.
[132:48.38]This is nice.
[132:48.88]Screen it.
[132:51.28]See that mountain over there?
[132:52.12]Mm-hmm.
[132:53.14]You can go there.
[132:53.48]You can't get there.
[132:54.42]The game's engine does not allow that.
[132:55.82]Well, we're on a mountain, so what if... You can't get to that one, though.
[132:58.07]Sorry, dude.
[132:58.39]I hate to, like, burst your bubble here.
[132:59.99]You can't fucking go there.
[133:01.73]Shut the fuck up about it.
[133:02.61]I'm already ahead of you.
[133:18.70]I need help getting this log up.
[133:21.54]You got more years ahead of you in-game.
[133:24.51]I got a couple more in-game years.
[133:27.23]Your character is 10 years younger than me.
[133:29.09]I wonder if we're going to be able to get in another car.
[133:33.47]I think so.
[133:34.64]I would assume so.
[133:35.58]I hope so.
[133:36.54]You wouldn't put, like, driving mechanics in a game for, like, 15 seconds.
[133:40.88]We were so hungry.
[133:41.56]Why don't we just get some fish?
[133:43.40]But it looks empty.
[133:46.29]Now here comes a very long-winded story cutscene here.
[133:49.07]I think characters never have to use the bathroom.
[133:50.73]Because it's implied we already did.
[133:52.94]Like, I already have a nude version of me.
[134:00.84]Like, why don't I have to poop, you know?
[134:03.71]Well, because it's implied that we already cleaned up a little bit.
[134:06.73]I knew we had to catch a fish.
[134:08.37]You old man?
[134:09.59]Nah, my uncle, actually.
[134:12.40]I don't know how this catches fish, but that's okay.
[134:17.32]We gotta scare the fish.
[134:18.32]They're gonna jump into the fire.
[134:19.62]Why are we doing a move from Kazooie to do this?
[134:21.56]I think we have to make them jump out of the... What if I just start splashing you?
[134:24.09]Will you be like, quit it!
[134:40.30]I already splashed you.
[134:41.24]And, uh... Quit it.
[134:43.14]Alright, I'm gonna... How about this?
[134:47.36]Catch one fish each.
[134:51.55]Catch one fish each.
[134:53.83]Mm-hmm.
[134:56.01]You know how you've been carrying around sticks the entire game?
[134:58.83]Do you have, like, a spear that we could, like, stab it with?
[135:01.71]I don't know.
[135:02.03]How are we supposed to do this?
[135:06.49]I think I'm just... Okay, I'm gonna move him to you.
[135:08.36]No, no, that's what we have to do.
[135:09.92]Yeah, but like, how do you get it when it's right next to you?
[135:11.84]So ping-pong them back and forth.
[135:12.50]Splash.
[135:15.58]See this one right here?
[135:16.54]Let's try to ping-pong this one.
[135:20.58]Alright, hang on.
[135:21.54]Let's take this one step at a time.
[135:22.94]Okay.
[135:23.40]Take this one step at a time.
[135:25.26]We need to cooperate.
[135:30.31]Sticks in the ground.
[135:30.83]Where's the camp?
[135:32.99]Camp is over here.
[135:36.37]Walking around in, like, wet khakis.
[135:40.80]It's gonna be the worst.
[135:41.46]Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[135:42.18]Like, scare the fish onto the land.
[135:46.22]Up there.
[135:47.30]Look at the other instructions, though.
[135:48.64]Oh, look at this.
[135:50.74]Look at this survival game.
[135:54.16]Alright, well, I'll light the fire.
[135:58.06]Now we're talking.
[135:59.64]Need more wood.
[136:03.69]Can you make one for me, too?
[136:04.81]I have to make one, too, don't I?
[136:09.59]Get some wood for the fire.
[136:11.78]We look like Best Buy employees.
[136:13.74]All right.
[136:22.76]Whoever gets the first one is the superior gamer.
[136:25.51]Okay.
[136:26.37]Kind of cheating, though, because I'm scaring them towards you, so you're going to have it easy.
[136:31.27]I mean, you agreed.
[136:33.61]Now they're in the ground.
[136:34.49]Superior gamer!
[136:36.17]That was basically a tie.
[136:40.57]Okay.
[136:47.66]You can move much quicker through this.
[136:48.98]This is not quicksand.
[136:55.78]We need more fire.
[136:56.52]I'm gonna need some more wood for the fire.
[136:59.96]So we have to carry these around now?
[137:01.32]Oh, shit.
[137:02.90]Wait, we can put it down.
[137:04.64]Just put it in the dirt.
[137:05.34]It's a little bit of dirt.
[137:06.00]It's fine.
[137:06.52]So we need wood.
[137:11.19]Twigs.
[137:11.93]Everything is erased now.
[137:13.25]Okay.
[137:16.05]Okay.
[137:18.29]Yeah, it is.
[137:20.37]You made it like this, not me.
[137:21.99]No, you're the one that said whoever does it first is a superior gamer.
[137:24.72]Yeah, but that was it.
[137:26.56]That was it.
[137:28.00]That was the end.
[137:28.46]Okay, fire's there.
[137:33.98]Go get your stick.
[137:36.52]So we can cook these at the same time, you know?
[137:39.15]Yeah, I could see that.
[137:39.85]We can have a nice sit-down discussion about our past lives and what we intend to do now that we're free men.
[137:45.98]Yeah, this is going to be a very long-winded cutscene here.
[137:56.02]This is our bonding moment.
[137:57.23]It didn't taste very good, I guess.
[137:59.01]That tasted like shit, man.
[138:01.73]You basically just are your character.
[138:04.37]You always say the thing he's about to say right before he says it.
[138:07.21]And my fucking feet hurt.
[138:09.95]What about yours?
[138:12.13]I'm good.
[138:13.73]So you're a tough guy, huh?
[138:15.57]Well, it's not like we have much of a choice here.
[138:18.56]Yeah.
[138:19.84]He said a swear.
[138:20.38]By the way, what are you in for?
[138:22.60]Something I didn't do.
[138:25.36]So you're innocent, huh?
[138:28.16]Well, aren't we all?
[138:29.59]I'm innocent too, you know.
[138:30.85]Took a shot at those two guys.
[138:31.91]Yeah.
[138:32.43]Took the diamond.
[138:33.39]Sure you are.
[138:34.73]What about family?
[138:35.59]You got any?
[138:37.13]Yeah.
[138:38.61]A wife.
[138:40.70]Let's just grow those chops for fun.
[138:54.54]Could you?
[138:54.84]No.
[138:55.02]When I grow my facial hair out, it looks like somebody placed each hair on my face as a joke.
[139:08.50]Like, you shaved the back of a cat, modded it all up, and pasted it on my face with Elmer's glue.
[139:14.58]That's how bad it looks.
[139:17.87]Yeah, I mean, that's how I look everywhere else except the goatee area.
[139:21.23]You have a hearty goatee, don't you?
[139:29.19]I have a what?
[139:29.75]You have a hearty goatee.
[139:30.97]You have a big hearty, full... Hearty, like H-E-A-R-T-Y?
[139:33.23]Hearty?
[139:33.43]Hearty.
[139:33.75]Uh, yeah, I suppose so.
[139:34.69]What's like that stupid man TV dinner called Hungry Man?
[139:56.26]Yeah, you have a hungry man kind of a goatee.
[139:58.70]Like with the instant potatoes and the macaroni?
[140:01.78]Yeah, the one that's supposed to be for big fat guys, apparently.
[140:04.68]Because TV dinners are not TV dinners.
[140:07.10]No, it's called a hearty man.
[140:09.26]Whoa.
[140:10.68]Was it called hearty man?
[140:13.13]I just had it.
[140:14.73]Hungry man?
[140:15.43]You have a man-sized TV dinner.
[140:17.37]Hungry man.
[140:17.81]Fuck me over, that's for sure.
[140:19.80]Hardy Man.
[140:20.88]Hardy Man.
[140:22.14]Yeah, they made a TV dinner specifically for big, fat people.
[140:29.63]It has, like, gross Salisbury steak that you microwave for eight seconds, and you take it out and you eat it as fast as you can.
[140:34.75]It's, like, 9,700 calories.
[140:36.73]Have you seen that, like...
[140:38.79]That college TV show by that, like, professor guy who, uh, it's how to eat on a budget and every single meal is microwaved?
[140:48.22]No, that's gross, though.
[140:50.46]You have to watch it?
[140:51.84]Look, I'm not a snob.
[140:52.68]I microwave a ton of stuff.
[140:55.15]It's the one where he makes, like, chili.
[140:59.17]No.
[140:59.29]Chat knows what I'm talking about.
[141:00.51]Your chat has got to know what I'm talking about.
[141:02.59]I'm sure they do.
[141:04.33]Somebody tell me what that's called.
[141:05.67]What's the name of it?
[141:07.19]I bet you could just Google Guy microwaves chili.
[141:14.45]Guy microwaves chili.
[141:16.63]It would come up with him.
[141:17.73]And you know what else you're going to get?
[141:19.17]You would love that video, seriously.
[141:21.23]But you're also going to get a ton of, like, eight-view videos of, like, some guy actually just microwaving chili and talking.
[141:28.45]This one's, like, everybody knows what this one is.
[141:30.94]Oh, I'm sure there is, but if you keep going, like, five pages...
[141:35.94]Like Weber or Weaver?
[141:37.04]Weaver chicken nuggets?
[141:37.74]No, like Weber.
[141:38.96]Weaver 2000 and all your 2000 parts?
[141:40.60]We'll have our guns soon enough.
[141:42.96]I think so.
[141:43.30]Okay, now we went from Monster Hunter to PUBG.
[141:44.99]We're wearing the same clothes we would be wearing if we played PUBG, so that's good.
[142:05.91]Yeah.
[142:07.83]Let's go inside that warehouse.
[142:08.85]I'm going to find a frying pan.
[142:09.85]You can find a terrible pistol, and we're both going to die in five minutes.
[142:13.35]And then we're going to uninstall the game.
[142:15.89]Vincent.
[142:16.11]It's a good reference.
[142:16.99]See that house?
[142:18.27]Let's check it out.
[142:18.83]Frying pan.
[142:19.45]Got him.
[142:19.97]Mm-hmm.
[142:20.27]Got him.
[142:23.15]Watch it.
[142:23.49]The blue zone's coming.
[142:25.03]Yeah, watch out.
[142:28.55]Hey, I hear footsteps.
[142:30.37]Do you?
[142:32.19]Oh, no.
[142:32.45]You're making another... Vincent, help me out here.
[142:35.99]Public, unpredictable berries, uh, greatness.
[142:41.64]Berries and grapes?
[142:42.78]Yeah.
[142:43.30]Public, unpredictable berries and grapes.
[142:47.80]What does that mean?
[142:48.24]Somebody's house.
[142:49.30]Yeah, we're about to accidentally murder someone.
[142:53.40]By the looks of it, an innocent old lady.
[142:57.54]I don't want to kill her.
[142:58.10]Let's just, like, change the TV channel.
[143:00.00]And just hide and see what she does.
[143:01.56]She's got a shotgun on the table.
[143:03.48]So what you mean is that's now our shotgun.
[143:05.07]See, it's just PUBG.
[143:07.19]Don't you worry, honey.
[143:09.49]Those two fools come around here.
[143:11.51]They'll get a taste of old Betsy.
[143:15.81]I say we take them out.
[143:17.51]Are you crazy?
[143:18.69]It's an old couple.
[143:19.55]We can't do that.
[143:20.66]I don't mean it like that.
[143:21.48]I mean, we have to do the evil playthrough.
[143:23.74]We really need to change clothes.
[143:25.40]We can't walk around like this.
[143:26.98]I don't like it.
[143:27.92]It's better to get them out of the house.
[143:30.18]What do you have in mind?
[143:32.67]Here comes another decision.
[143:35.75]We're going in there and making a scene, right?
[143:38.67]You want to go like release the horses?
[143:42.07]Like on the one hand, I feel like I owe some allegiance to my character.
[143:44.59]Yeah.
[143:56.62]But on the other hand, why is your character's way the more fun sounding way?
[144:01.24]Because I'm the crazy guy.
[144:02.26]You're the more collected tax attorney.
[144:05.06]And I'm the crazy guy that likes to punch people and stuff.
[144:09.02]I mean, we know which one we're going to pick.
[144:11.52]But like, I still feel guilty.
[144:13.47]You want to let like chat decide this one?
[144:15.87]No, we know which one they're going to pick.
[144:17.63]I mean, do we?
[144:18.41]You can.
[144:18.97]Go ahead.
[144:20.01]You know, if they want to release the horses, but they're not gonna.
[144:23.35]You know, I want to see what they say.
[144:25.53]Okay.
[144:26.50]This is going to be a what-if scenario.
[144:28.54]Put the link in TeamSpeak.
[144:31.83]Yeah, I'll give it to you.
[144:35.75]Release.
[144:37.17]You know what?
[144:37.55]Just because I said that, everyone is going to try to do the opposite of what I said.
[144:42.09]I don't know, man.
[144:42.85]It depends.
[144:43.35]You know what?
[144:46.30]I can't blame you.
[144:46.92]Alright, I'm going to give it to you here.
[144:53.32]My chat is entirely horses.
[144:57.01]Here is the poll.
[144:58.09]I'm putting it into the chat room here.
[145:02.81]Yes.
[145:03.07]TeamSpeak in 2018.
[145:04.47]You're right.
[145:05.29]You know why?
[145:06.35]Still got a better codec than Discord.
[145:09.78]Oh.
[145:10.10]But you guys don't even know what the word codec means.
[145:13.78]I do.
[145:15.02]Is you go and then you shake it until it looks better and then it takes about two hours and then you throw in the trash.
[145:26.38]Let's see.
[145:28.33]In short, it means better voice quality.
[145:30.52]Well, Release the Horses is winning by a lot, it seems.
[145:35.04]Did you put it in your chat?
[145:36.36]I did, yeah.
[145:38.13]I'm honestly surprised.
[145:41.23]I think it's just because I made such a stink about it, they wanted to prove me wrong.
[145:45.21]Well.
[145:46.96]Because it is two to one.
[145:50.70]You guys really want to see us release the horses?
[145:52.44]Alright, release Vincent's way.
[145:55.28]That's it?
[145:55.66]Yeah, there's no coming back from this one.
[145:57.22]There's no coming back from that.
[145:58.60]There you go.
[145:58.96]That's gonna get you on.
[146:02.42]We did it.
[146:03.62]Yay.
[146:13.93]Watch this turn out to be, like, the worst, crazier way.
[146:17.57]It's a horse bar.
[146:19.35]They serve only horses.
[146:20.31]Chickens.
[146:21.03]That is definitely not empty.
[146:24.89]There's a horse in here.
[146:25.69]Is that a ghost?
[146:28.20]Give me a sec.
[146:30.56]I'm, like, burping.
[146:36.52]That looks like the right way.
[146:37.58]I can't go over that.
[146:42.02]Come on.
[146:44.08]You can't go over that fence.
[146:47.86]What the absolute heck?
[146:55.20]Well, that's fine.
[146:58.98]I don't think we can go this way either.
[147:05.72]Do we have to crawl through the chicken coop or something?
[147:14.71]Oh.
[147:17.16]Okay.
[147:18.46]We need the ladder.
[147:20.40]Don't sound so dejected.
[147:21.52]We're not even done.
[147:23.10]Yeah, I know, but why can't we just walk over?
[147:27.04]Am I going to put this on the side of the building?
[147:30.13]We don't want to get caught.
[147:32.31]Where does this go?
[147:37.53]I'm doing a very good job of balancing this by myself.
[147:40.41]There is a clear doorway up here.
[147:43.99]Right there.
[147:44.41]I thought it was... Why have the giant thing over there?
[147:46.74]Yeah, I know the window is here.
[147:52.58]Hey, where were you?
[147:53.28]I'm just waiting on you, I guess.
[148:00.92]We're not gonna get caught.
[148:05.03]We're too heavily skilled for that.
[148:06.87]Come on.
[148:07.51]Give us a little bit of credit.
[148:08.29]Okay.
[148:08.39]Horses...
[148:16.06]I thought we had to come up through here.
[148:17.74]What am I doing?
[148:21.14]There are the horses.
[148:22.84]Let's release them.
[148:26.20]There are the horses.
[148:28.15]They're here.
[148:30.63]Be careful, big guys.
[148:32.07]Here you go, buddy.
[148:33.55]I just need to get one?
[148:36.07]Of course.
[148:36.61]Freedom for all, right?
[148:38.65]Can't argue with that.
[148:40.39]Hey.
[148:42.29]Have you seen The Last Jedi?
[148:43.27]Yeah, you have.
[148:43.95]I've seen The Last Jedi.
[148:44.87]Yeah, you have.
[148:45.77]I've seen that movie.
[148:46.63]We're in The Last Jedi now.
[148:48.45]Oh, don't even.
[148:49.13]That's not even a good reference.
[148:51.17]That's a reference that makes me sad.
[148:52.69]Yes, it is.
[148:53.19]This is a perfect reference.
[148:54.49]No, it's not.
[148:56.39]It's a perfect reference.
[148:57.63]All right, get up here and let's drop the cement down.
[149:00.41]Let's see if this scene is better than it.
[149:02.68]All right.
[149:02.98]Its counterpart.
[149:03.90]I'm willing to give that to you.
[149:04.96]Is this scene better than The Last Jedi?
[149:07.06]The whole movie.
[149:08.94]I can do that.
[149:12.03]I think I need to come down there.
[149:12.95]Should I have to help you?
[149:13.81]I think we have to open the door first.
[149:15.45]Are we going to release the horses?
[149:22.55]Together at the same time here?
[149:24.11]I can't even click.
[149:25.40]It's locked.
[149:26.56]Maybe the horses will run into it.
[149:33.34]Can you get on the horse?
[149:35.04]Come on.
[149:35.50]Get moving.
[149:39.71]You just pat them.
[149:41.55]Okay, I figured it out.
[149:42.43]You got one open?
[149:44.13]This door will open.
[149:45.29]I think the horses will push it.
[149:46.41]Alright, so let's go dump the cement thing.
[149:57.30]Cement thing is over here.
[149:58.32]Alright, let's scare the horses.
[150:16.48]Alright.
[150:19.42]Glad we did this one.
[150:20.56]This one was really fun.
[150:21.36]I don't think you guys are running fast enough.
[150:23.89]Alright.
[150:24.13]Well, now we're going inside.
[150:25.47]Mm-hmm.
[150:47.17]I'm getting the shotgun.
[150:50.75]Why am I following you?
[150:54.96]It's up to you who you want to follow now.
[150:56.40]This is a co-op game.
[150:57.04]I'm going right in the front door.
[150:58.84]What's this we got?
[151:03.22]He brought the shotgun with him.
[151:05.82]Who am I calling?
[151:09.07]Uh, hi.
[151:09.85]Is this Steve?
[151:11.69]No?
[151:12.77]Rob?
[151:14.58]What?
[151:15.64]What is this?
[151:16.16]This is a different video game.
[151:22.27]We can banjo duel, you understand?
[151:23.85]I'm calling like a pizza.
[151:26.85]Hey, remember we needed to change those clothes?
[151:35.76]Alright, hang up the phone.
[151:40.84]This is just play with the funhouse, the game.
[151:43.36]Alright, wait a minute.
[151:45.54]What is this?
[151:46.04]Might as well give them a hand with the dishes.
[151:47.78]I'm doing the dishes for them.
[151:50.62]The least you can do, man.
[151:51.80]It is the least that we can do.
[151:53.83]How long is this song?
[151:57.61]What is this?
[151:58.09]Is this a cookie jar?
[151:59.17]Alright, yeah.
[152:06.09]Now we like cut the gas line.
[152:07.66]Hot dogs!
[152:16.76]Too many.
[152:17.26]That's too many notes.
[152:18.48]It just really ramps up the difficulty on extreme.
[152:23.12]This is the dumbest thing ever.
[152:27.98]Like, if they come back, we're just fucking around in their house.
[152:33.81]Playing with all their toys.
[152:35.85]What?
[152:39.29]There's war?
[152:41.11]There's more.
[152:41.61]Then there's a piano.
[152:47.50]Wait a minute, where's the shotgun?
[152:49.26]Can we play the piano at the same time?
[152:57.48]I'll get the banjo.
[152:59.78]Play together.
[153:02.54]Extreme.
[153:03.84]No, I tried that.
[153:04.85]It's miserable.
[153:06.31]You're just gonna make the same joke.
[153:08.37]Damn it.
[153:14.39]Even medium's too much.
[153:23.14]Oh, you guys couldn't see what I was doing the whole time.
[153:27.78]I can't see your notes.
[153:36.78]Oh, let me just fucking destroy that first try.
[153:38.58]Let's go.
[153:45.68]That's good.
[153:46.32]That's good.
[153:47.48]We unlocked the special cutscene!
[153:48.94]We got the special cutscene.
[153:50.44]Yeah!
[153:51.02]Come on, Vincent!
[153:53.40]What the fuck are you doing in our house?!
[153:57.64]Shotgun blast.
[153:58.72]No, they're not even gonna be mad because we're so good.
[154:03.31]They're gonna come back and they're just gonna be impressed.
[154:07.47]Hey, we got the good ending.
[154:09.75]This is good ending.
[154:12.10]Nice.
[154:12.84]Didn't know you had it in you.
[154:13.94]What can I say?
[154:14.72]I'm full of surprises.
[154:16.13]Mostly good ones.
[154:17.45]I can tell.
[154:20.15]This kind of shit just makes this game... That just makes this game fun.
[154:23.13]Relax on the couch.
[154:23.73]I want to make sure they know that they can come back and be comfortable.
[154:26.71]I can't believe you actually can do this.
[154:36.12]I'm making the fire.
[154:37.64]Oh my get my kill steel.
[154:40.80]I was making the fire.
[154:41.78]Let's just watch TV This is great I really want them to come back.
[154:52.93]I really do they would let's go upstairs.
[154:55.06]Oh
[154:59.52]Put on some music.
[155:00.72]I want a Goldilocks this chair.
[155:02.48]Oh, I don't like that one.
[155:03.18]What about upstairs?
[155:03.66]Oh, there's definitely more toys upstairs, man.
[155:05.24]What the hell is this thing?
[155:06.54]I think it keeps going.
[155:10.50]You don't have to keep spinning it.
[155:26.32]Well, that's just rude.
[155:28.77]What I just did was just mean.
[155:30.25]There's nothing funny there.
[155:31.87]I just drool over a picture in this guy's hallway.
[155:36.17]Here we go, close.
[155:36.85]Oh, you're doing the prank calls now too?
[155:46.80]Alright, right now we are just being sims.
[155:50.55]Do you understand?
[155:51.15]We're just going around.
[155:52.75]Where did I get this?
[155:53.91]I think I just called my wife in-game.
[155:57.57]Uh, excuse me.
[156:00.98]What are you carrying right now?
[156:02.32]Hey, what's your energy and your social at right now?
[156:04.56]Because that's what we're doing.
[156:05.32]Yeah, I found a shotgun in here.
[156:15.19]My hygiene is very low right now.
[156:17.49]I'm gonna go do the thing that gives me plus fun.
[156:20.59]Use telephone.
[156:24.13]I can't believe these were actually used in wars.
[156:26.99]I wanna use that then.
[156:28.09]Wait, you wanna trade guns?
[156:29.73]No, I want the flintlock.
[156:31.70]So you can use it.
[156:32.20]It's only decorative.
[156:33.42]No, it's a decoration.
[156:35.16]Hey, my grandma had one of these.
[156:38.06]More Sims toys to play with.
[156:42.47]This is like the ADD paradise because if anyone's bored looking at one thing, they just look at the other side of the screen and there's like another thing going on.
[156:50.24]Also, there's a secret door here.
[156:51.98]Is there?
[156:52.86]I don't know how to open it.
[156:53.54]They have like a panic room or something.
[156:54.66]Let's get it open.
[156:59.23]More stuff here?
[156:59.95]What's this?
[157:00.35]Are you serious?
[157:00.85]Keep still.
[157:08.17]How do I do this?
[157:10.68]It's better than expected.
[157:13.18]Okay, let's get it right this time.
[157:16.46]Well, it's time for you to go to work and make 300 simoleons, whatever they are.
[157:20.62]What are they called?
[157:22.78]What's the Sims money?
[157:25.04]This is the first and last time I'm testing this type of hat.
[157:33.29]I want to wear that one for the rest of the game though.
[157:38.08]Sims?
[157:38.94]What is it called?
[157:41.52]Oh, you wiped it off!
[157:42.58]Oh, I cleaned it.
[157:44.61]Look at that interaction.
[157:45.73]I'm ruining this.
[157:49.01]I'm the bad one.
[157:50.45]Looking good, man.
[157:51.79]My eyes are starting to look puffy.
[157:54.53]I wish you could walk around with that stupid hat on for the rest of the game.
[157:57.05]Alright, go change your clothes.
[158:00.50]My wife always says that I don't look good in hats.
[158:08.87]That's just the sniper from Team Fortress 2.
[158:10.45]I'm sorry, I had to say it.
[158:13.30]It is.
[158:14.00]Take that image of when it was at that angle and superimpose it on Team Fortress.
[158:18.02]Hang on, let's go sit on the bed together.
[158:19.64]No.
[158:20.48]Come over here.
[158:21.20]Will you go change your clothes at least?
[158:22.46]There's two bed spots.
[158:24.04]Like, just come on.
[158:25.94]Just see if anything happens.
[158:27.58]Why is there a twin bed in here?
[158:29.52]I know somebody in the chat is shipping these two characters.
[158:31.68]We have to make their dream come true.
[158:33.21]Alright, fine.
[158:34.05]I've always found these kind of soothing...
[158:41.31]Alright, go do it.
[158:46.28]Disappointed.
[158:46.94]No, this is just a confessional at church.
[158:50.24]Let's go.
[158:50.62]Alright, I have a gun.
[158:53.46]Change your clothes.
[158:54.04]Maybe you'll get a gun too.
[158:57.30]Excuse me, this is a private affair.
[158:58.74]I can't go in there.
[159:01.66]I wish I could just pull the shotgun out and just shoot.
[159:03.68]Looking like Indiana Jones.
[159:06.40]Oh, that guy has the same clothes you have.
[159:09.05]It's just a different kind of shirt.
[159:10.47]He has the same taste as you.
[159:12.41]He's got the same taste.
[159:15.47]I don't know.
[159:16.53]Is there anything else we can do?
[159:19.95]Alright, let's get out of here.
[159:26.96]How do we open the secret door?
[159:27.94]Is there a way to do it?
[159:29.84]I don't think there's a way to do it.
[159:34.06]Yeah.
[159:39.72]I don't know how to do it, though.
[159:45.28]How do you get to call twice and I only get to call once?
[159:47.56]What's in the kitchen?
[159:49.50]Uh, there is some delicious food in the kitchen.
[159:53.72]Where's the truck?
[159:59.60]If I was a truck, where would I be?
[160:01.29]Down here?
[160:01.61]Looking for a hamburger.
[160:09.45]This beer must have been open for a long time.
[160:11.75]I I just drank out of that one.
[160:13.39]This is what you did were you describing I Like said hey, this is rotten and you drank it All right, we need to find the truck in the garage These people don't have any cars they just they parked their horses in their garage My guys so like gentle spirit kind-hearted, I think it's over here.
[160:36.76]I want to why do you have a gun I?
[160:38.99]I changed first, apparently.
[160:43.19]Somebody said bookshelf.
[160:44.15]Bookshelf.
[160:44.63]Bookshelf.
[160:45.13]Bookshelf.
[160:45.61]Book.
[160:45.83]They're freaking out.
[160:46.31]They're saying bookshelf.
[160:47.37]They're all saying bookshelf.
[160:48.57]Everyone is freaking out.
[160:49.45]There's a lot of empty bookshelves, though.
[160:52.13]I'm hearing bookshelf.
[160:55.31]It's the only thing that's in the chat.
[161:00.35]Bookshelf?
[161:00.91]Look, I tried.
[161:02.47]I tried.
[161:02.93]Nothing here.
[161:03.57]Nothing on the bookshelf?
[161:08.29]Unless there's another bookshelf I can interact with.
[161:12.73]Is that it?
[161:18.90]Sit down.
[161:19.42]What?
[161:20.80]They're saying sit first.
[161:24.48]Sit down and then bookshelf.
[161:25.86]All right, I'm going to sit down.
[161:26.78]Okay, you sit down.
[161:28.82]Where's bookshelf?
[161:30.72]You were sitting here already.
[161:31.72]How did you not do this?
[161:35.22]Of course.
[161:37.11]Alright.
[161:37.75]You happy now, chat?
[161:39.89]I'm just gonna sit here for the rest of the game while I read this book.
[161:44.65]That's what they wanted you guys to... Oh, they wanted... Okay, they wanted you to... Alright, get up.
[161:49.67]Let's go.
[161:52.50]We need to go to the truck.
[161:54.16]To be fair, though, that is like a very specific-looking book.
[161:58.98]Yeah, it is.
[162:00.24]That stands out from everyone else.
[162:01.76]Alright, time to get into the truck.
[162:07.05]Are you going back upstairs again?
[162:09.97]Throw horses.
[162:12.33]What?
[162:14.75]Oh, we can play horseshoes.
[162:16.71]No.
[162:17.07]Yes, we can.
[162:18.59]You better get down here.
[162:19.27]I love it.
[162:21.53]This is just the mini game part of the game.
[162:23.91]Yeah.
[162:28.49]Climbing out the window.
[162:30.43]It's a perfectly usable front door.
[162:31.87]I bet you do this, though, if you have to get in while the people are still there.
[162:36.49]Alright, your turn.
[162:39.13]Not only that, we're being real romantic here, okay?
[162:41.85]I wanted to use the, like, secret upstairs.
[162:44.91]Dude, it's just like going back.
[162:47.17]Where's horseshoes?
[162:48.03]We turned this place into not only the Sims house, but a McDonald's play place.
[162:52.88]The horseshoes are over there.
[162:57.36]Oh, that's where the truck is.
[162:58.22]I want to play horseshoes.
[162:59.44]I'm going in here for a second.
[163:02.18]Anything else in here?
[163:04.04]I want to play with the fun stuff.
[163:06.22]Gas can?
[163:09.54]What am I doing with this?
[163:11.28]Uh, yeah.
[163:13.48]I got it.
[163:15.20]I've got the gas.
[163:20.03]Alright, where was the big heavy door?
[163:21.43]Uh, up the hill.
[163:24.59]Follow me.
[163:26.73]Open the goddamn door.
[163:27.67]Clock.
[163:28.13]Clock.
[163:29.53]Clock.
[163:29.95]I'm not clicking on a clock.
[163:31.07]Clock?
[163:34.33]You clowns are not going to get us to click on a clock, okay?
[163:37.91]I don't know.
[163:38.50]I want to see what's behind the secret door.
[163:41.90]Chat clowns.
[163:43.12]Constantly.
[163:45.20]Contemporarily.
[163:46.06]Getting us to click on a clock.
[163:48.08]Come on, clock for real.
[163:48.92]I'm not touching a clock.
[164:00.91]Hey, it's even missing a wheel.
[164:03.41]Nah, I'm sure there's a spare around here somewhere.
[164:06.69]You find the spare, I'll fill up the gas.
[164:08.77]It's not like we have a choice.
[164:10.73]Sherby's running on foot.
[164:12.17]If I go click on the clock and it doesn't do anything, does that mean we get to ban everybody who's had clock?
[164:17.21]It's literally every single person.
[164:19.83]I don't know if you want to do that.
[164:22.49]There would be like eight people in chat.
[164:25.35]Let's see what's under the fucking hood.
[164:26.45]This could probably lift the car.
[164:28.28]Ready, Leo?
[164:29.06]Looks like the battery is out of juice.
[164:32.37]I can't wait till we soup this thing up.
[164:34.49]Where's the gas can?
[164:35.79]I wanna, I wanna put some hydraulics on it.
[164:39.80]Oh, that's not gonna make it, like, roll out cartoon style down the road.
[164:44.28]It doesn't have a wheel.
[164:45.18]Alright, we can use a lug wrench here.
[164:47.86]Alright, I can hold it up while, uh, you... While I lug wrench.
[164:52.25]Alright, I got a lug wrench.
[164:53.09]Where's the wheel?
[164:58.01]Where's that wheel?
[164:58.71]There's a tire on the other side of the barn.
[165:01.11]Other side of the barn?
[165:04.01]Anything else?
[165:05.83]You're going to have to look across.
[165:08.39]What the hell are you doing?
[165:11.05]Oh, my God.
[165:11.47]I need a tire first.
[165:13.11]No, it's on the other side.
[165:13.89]You got to come up here.
[165:16.19]Come with me.
[165:17.68]Who's playing the banjo?
[165:18.44]And you'll see.
[165:19.60]That's us from earlier.
[165:20.60]They recorded it and they put it on the radio.
[165:22.48]Okay, go ahead.
[165:23.38]I'm going to do this thing.
[165:29.75]I'm not going to lie, this would be kind of fun.
[165:33.23]Clock, clock, clock, clock.
[165:40.95]No, get over it.
[165:41.85]We're not going to the clock.
[165:49.89]Um, I'm going to find out.
[165:57.75]The clock is going to tell you the time.
[166:01.19]That's great.
[166:03.89]Uh, grab the tire iron.
[166:06.19]It's sitting right there.
[166:07.55]I can jump down from here.
[166:08.27]Just grab the iron and hop down.
[166:13.18]We could use this to fasten a new tire.
[166:15.78]That is the idea.
[166:17.46]I'll get the tire.
[166:18.18]This is just like dad and son repair their car.
[166:23.59]Alright, look.

[166:27.79]You're not going to go to the clock, are you?

[169:10.76]Did you enjoy the clock?
[169:13.40]What did you learn from the clock?
[169:18.54]Anything important?
[169:19.12]Pretty sure there's no clock.
[169:23.65]But I'm getting better at the banjo, but there's some insanely difficult segments here.
[169:27.89]Jeremy, you need to go
[169:30.31]Now they're saying both hats at once.
[169:33.05]We're not doing two hats at the same time.
[169:36.07]Absolutely not.
[169:38.95]Not gonna happen.
[169:40.65]We need two people for the hats.
[169:45.54]Does this song have an end?
[169:50.48]I don't think it does.
[169:51.72]I'm putting the wrench on.
[169:53.30]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[169:57.50]Two clocks at the same time.
[170:00.32]No.
[170:02.82]You guys are just bullshit.
[170:05.26]Yeah, now they're just making stuff up.
[170:07.10]Yeah, and now you're going to say what?
[170:09.56]Look at the lawnmower.
[170:10.42]You're going to mow the specific part of the grass.
[170:13.04]You both didn't throw a horseshoe at the same time.
[170:21.47]I need your help.
[170:22.45]It's not going to work.
[170:23.33]We've got to lift the car first.
[170:26.06]Alright, still playing.
[170:27.66]Alright, excuse me, Sim Italics, I need you over here to do the job.
[170:34.07]Look at that.
[170:35.27]That's right.
[170:38.25]It's actually pretty decent horseshoes.
[170:41.09]I mean, it's alright.
[170:44.27]It's pretty good, honestly.
[170:47.48]Not only is it a timing game, it's like an aiming... I got one.
[170:50.01]Give me one second.
[170:50.57]I got to do it one more time.
[170:52.87]While I was... While we were enthralled here, acepicklace gave $50.
[170:57.17]A little while back here.
[171:00.09]Thank you, ace, for the 50... 0, 0, 0.
[171:04.49]0, 0, 0.
[171:04.55]Yeah.
[171:05.09]No, the 50, 0, 0.
[171:07.30]That's right, Leo.
[171:09.92]I challenge you to a duel.
[171:12.02]It says, kill italics, eat the couple.
[171:13.54]I actually did score more than you.
[171:15.76]Kill italics, eat the couple.
[171:19.58]It did tally scores, and I beat you.
[171:22.28]With the horseshoes?
[171:23.50]Yeah.
[171:23.76]I was just throwing them randomly.
[171:25.06]Yeah, but it kept scoring.
[171:26.18]I won.
[171:26.50]All right.
[171:27.50]You need to come over here.
[171:28.08]You need to fix this while I hold this up.
[171:31.15]I'm here, bossy.
[171:32.19]You need to go do work while I hold this up.
[171:33.53]This is heavy.
[171:34.15]Where is the tire iron?
[171:36.15]It's on the other side.
[171:37.49]Where's the tire?
[171:39.09]The tire's on it.
[171:40.27]Oh, you already put it on there?
[171:41.35]Yeah.
[171:41.59]You need to go under.
[171:42.77]No, no.
[171:42.91]Grab the wood.
[171:43.61]The wooden log.
[171:44.81]Right there.
[171:48.17]We have to screw the wheels in.
[171:50.53]I just did.
[171:54.09]Okay, that's that.
[171:59.45]I do have to drive this time.
[172:03.85]You can drive this time.
[172:04.89]You have a gun, so I kind of have to.
[172:07.25]Yeah.
[172:07.63]Well, we need to put gas in the car?
[172:10.15]No, we have to push it first.
[172:11.95]Where are we pushing this to?
[172:13.39]This doesn't seem like a smart idea.
[172:18.13]Okay, grunt in tandem.
[172:19.99]What if we just did this all the way to where we were going?
[172:22.57]I told you that was going to happen.
[172:24.23]Did you let go?
[172:25.07]I didn't let go.
[172:25.67]Did you let go?
[172:26.57]Whatever.
[172:27.33]Let's go get it.
[172:28.01]Oh, gas.
[172:29.69]It's fine.
[172:33.95]I didn't let go.
[172:34.47]Did you let go?
[172:35.05]I didn't look at the clock.
[172:36.35]Did you look at the clock?
[172:42.76]Fucking clock.
[172:46.12]Oh, where's the gas tank?
[172:49.76]No, the gas tank is not in the hood of the car.
[173:02.79]Where are you going?
[173:05.93]Well, I'm trying.
[173:06.51]Oh, it's over here.
[173:07.13]It's over here.
[173:09.62]Seems like it's out of gas.
[173:11.88]True.
[173:14.64]Clock all right, which which clock are you referring to?
[173:19.12]The clock one said the clock is actually real and it linked a YouTube video.
[173:22.63]All right, let's go.
[173:23.89]Let's go.
[173:24.45]Fuck it get in the house I'm not gonna watch the YouTube video.
[173:27.09]Don't watch the YouTube video Just get in the house and let's do those just pull the lever on the clock Look in the house I went looking for the clock and there was no clock I could I swear to God if there if there is no clock in here I'm gonna mute the stream for five minutes.
[173:43.53]Oh
[173:46.78]Where?
[173:47.00]Which clock?
[173:47.58]There's like three clocks.
[173:48.78]There's this clock down here.
[173:49.46]There's this clock right here.
[173:50.84]That one doesn't do anything.
[173:51.82]Nothing.
[173:52.08]There's this clock here.
[173:53.38]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[173:57.92]Whoa, why can you interact with it, but I can't?
[174:00.77]Hold on, hold on.
[174:02.91]That's weird.
[174:04.73]Did it open the door?
[174:07.29]No, the door's still closed.
[174:10.51]I think there's a co-op moment required.
[174:13.03]Do both clocks at the same time.
[174:17.31]I hear the... I hear it.
[174:22.09]Is it in this room?
[174:22.77]I think we both need to do the same clock.
[174:24.47]Yeah, you gotta come over here.
[174:25.25]Do the same clock.
[174:28.11]Yeah, down here with me.
[174:29.09]You gotta get on the other side.
[174:30.15]There's two levers to pull.
[174:35.20]I can't even touch it.
[174:36.98]You can't touch the clock?
[174:38.12]No, I can't touch this clock.
[174:39.50]There's gotta be one for me and one for you.
[174:43.12]Unless you just... Can you pull that?
[174:44.76]Yep.
[174:46.87]But I can pull it.
[174:47.71]Okay, let's try it.
[174:52.18]Wait, wait, wait.
[174:52.56]Ready?
[174:53.06]One, two, three.
[174:55.96]Holy shit, they weren't lying.
[174:56.94]You've got to be kidding me.
[174:59.74]They weren't lying.
[175:01.76]There's no way I could have figured that out, though, without... I should have just pushed buttons.
[175:09.92]I knew this was a secret room.
[175:11.58]But what's the point of even being in here?
[175:13.02]Is a chest in here?
[175:20.68]Oh my god.
[175:21.14]That's it.
[175:21.50]It was a Zelda easter egg.
[175:22.70]Zelda easter egg in here.
[175:24.86]Hey, wasn't that cool?
[175:25.52]Hey, wasn't that cool?
[175:26.38]Like now we lost like 15 minutes repairing the truck.
[175:30.62]I've always wanted to do that.
[175:47.30]Ta-da.
[175:47.89]All right, listen, there's one more thing everyone wants us to do over here.
[175:51.95]Oh, my God.
[175:52.27]Don't get... What is it?
[175:55.71]They want us to try to put both hats on at the same time.
[175:58.12]Oh, my God.
[176:02.46]It's not going to work, though.
[176:03.78]Why?
[176:04.24]I don't know.
[176:05.43]It's just not going to work.
[176:06.37]Don't feed them.
[176:07.23]You're lining them up in like a trough and feeding them whatever they want.
[176:11.89]Yeah.
[176:13.37]Ready?
[176:13.93]One, two, three.
[176:15.13]It's not going to work.
[176:16.07]It's not going to work.
[176:16.73]Time to go home.
[176:18.23]Oh, wait.
[176:19.70]You can do it, right?
[176:21.02]Hold on.
[176:23.62]I can't even look at them.
[176:25.56]Move away for a second.
[176:29.24]Okay, I can do this one.
[176:31.79]Grab the other one.
[176:32.75]I can't.
[176:33.49]Ready?
[176:34.59]I can't.
[176:35.13]Can you grab this?
[176:35.57]Can you grab one now?
[176:36.21]Nope.
[176:37.97]Why are we fucking doing this right now?
[176:39.77]Put the hat down.
[176:43.55]Put the hat down and let's get back to the truck.
[176:45.74]And let's fix the truck up and drive and play the game.
[176:52.60]Hell yeah.
[176:59.03]Hey guess what the lawnmower doesn't do anything I've already been I've been near it already But yeah, but the clock didn't have a prompt either Where's the fucking lawnmower perfect right there much this bingo I want to see you leave

[177:24.75]Hey, look at that.
[177:30.58]Shit doesn't do anything.
[177:31.68]I'll see you guys in five minutes.
[178:08.32]Other side of the house, yeah.
[178:10.57]There you go.
[178:12.19]Keep going.

[178:13.43]No, no, no.
[178:13.67]Over here.
[178:16.59]Alright.
[178:16.85]At the same time.
[178:17.81]One.
[178:19.57]Two.
[178:19.83]There's no way.
[178:21.49]Now, mute your stream.
[178:22.39]Mute your stream for five minutes.
[178:25.64]What do you mean mute my stream?
[178:27.84]We're turning off for five minutes.
[178:29.38]Mute the stream.
[178:30.10]Mute the game for at least two minutes.
[178:32.62]This is punishment.
[178:33.80]Punish the chat.
[178:34.92]Mute the stream.
[179:02.83]All right, well, whatever.
[179:04.62]You guys got your time out.
[179:10.41]So how do we do this?
[179:11.01]We didn't do anything wrong.
[179:12.53]We need batteries.
[179:14.46]I came over from Germany.
[179:16.46]Sub only mode.
[179:17.36]It's safe here.
[179:20.66]It's a different lawn mower.
[179:22.28]Fuck off.
[179:23.78]Fuck off.
[179:24.86]It's a different lawn mower.
[179:26.76]Look, I can't even see what they're saying.
[179:29.13]They can't hear us.
[179:30.29]This is a safe place.
[179:31.07]What's the worst song you've ever heard in your life?
[179:35.55]Clearly, they can hear us.
[179:36.97]That's fine, they can hear us.
[179:37.69]What is the worst music, worst song you've ever heard in your life?
[179:40.53]Absolute worst fucking song.
[179:41.79]Well, there's a clear classic, and it's rat-related.
[179:45.47]That's the worst song you've ever heard?
[179:46.43]It's the Chuck E. Cheese song.
[179:48.07]No, no, no, it's gotta be worse than that.
[179:49.36]It's gotta be something that, like, nobody wants to hear.
[179:51.48]No, that... Trust me.
[179:53.74]I got this.
[179:56.78]I think you have to do something here.
[179:57.90]You have to start the car.
[180:00.10]Are you about to torture them with audio?
[180:01.62]I'm just gonna mute the whole thing and play something that they just don't want to hear.
[180:06.36]Well, why do you ask me for the worst song I ever heard and then immediately say, no, not that one?
[180:12.78]No, because that's not the worst song that anyone's ever heard.
[180:15.19]But you haven't heard it.
[180:15.97]How do you know?
[180:16.41]The Chuck E. Cheese?
[180:17.27]The commercial for the Chuck E. Cheese?
[180:18.89]No, not the commercial.
[180:19.93]The song they play inside of Chuck E. Cheese.
[180:21.91]Chuck E. Cheese.
[180:22.67]What is it, like the pizza song?
[180:26.41]I think it is the Happy Dance.
[180:28.91]Chuck E. Cheese Happy Dance.
[180:30.57]Mm-hmm.
[180:33.51]Okay.
[180:35.58]Hey, see you in a few minutes, guys.
[180:37.52]It's been fun.
[180:37.86]Hey, everybody.
[180:38.88]We have a brand new dance called Chucky's Happy Dance.
[180:41.64]Chucky, are you ready to show them?
[180:43.30]Let's do it.
[180:44.22]The first thing we're going to do is jump up and down and push our hands in the air.
[180:51.36]And then we're going to bob side to side and spin around.
[180:56.51]Next, we're going to give ourselves a high five.
[181:04.84]Great job.
[181:05.42]The next thing we're going to do is step really high and stomp our feet on the ground.
[181:08.77]Do you guys want to dance with me?
[181:13.41]Yeah!
[181:13.51]Great.
[181:14.15]It's really easy.
[181:15.25]Just follow me.
[181:17.39]I know this is important.
[181:18.83]This is important.
[181:20.89]This is important.
[181:21.75]Shut this off.
[181:22.81]The joke is over.
[181:23.77]The joke is over.
[181:24.94]I don't want to hear this.
[181:25.84]The old people are back.
[181:26.92]They're back.
[181:27.30]The joke's over.
[181:27.78]Just wait here.
[181:28.72]I'll be fine.
[181:30.92]Filthy scum!
[181:32.68]How was the song?
[181:33.76]It was awful.
[181:35.14]You were right.
[181:35.78]I told you.
[181:36.32]I'm safe from the song.
[181:39.60]It's better here.
[182:01.77]This is your punishment for petating us.
[182:05.33]All right, so we're going to do a... Driving segment.
[182:12.67]Driving segment of the game, I assume.
[182:15.39]What if we had to share a wheel and we had to turn it together?
[182:18.36]Is this plus two letter grades or just plus one?
[182:21.50]This is included in the plus one.
[182:26.92]This is a big segment.
[182:28.96]I'm looking forward to this.
[182:30.82]I got the gun.
[182:32.99]How many bullets do I have?
[182:38.37]Uh, I assume infinite.
[182:39.53]Alright.
[182:40.29]Nice.
[182:40.49]Aim and shoot.
[182:41.05]Good luck.
[182:41.87]Oh, wow, that, oh, headshot.
[183:02.43]Okay, well, they're kind of close.
[183:07.09]How's your burnout training last night, by the way?
[183:09.28]It was pretty good.
[183:11.66]I need to load up.
[183:16.00]Why are they so psychotic?
[183:17.54]They're insane.
[183:18.34]There's nobody even driving this one.
[183:19.46]Yeah, there is.
[183:24.38]Oh, boy.
[183:30.77]This is a lot harder than it looks.
[183:32.65]We just got Sam... We just got Panini pressed.
[183:38.65]These are worse than GTA cops.
[183:40.51]Yeah, they are.
[183:44.60]They're actually worse than GTA cops.
[183:48.68]Oh, it's gonna be tight.
[183:53.30]Wow, if you almost just crashed us into that thing.
[183:57.08]What is the camera doing?
[184:00.10]Help me out here.
[184:01.38]We got another roadblock coming up.
[184:04.78]Oh, not now.
[184:07.54]This is gonna be tight.
[184:10.30]What happened?
[184:11.48]You okay?
[184:11.78]Hold on, man.
[184:12.90]I'm fine.
[184:13.82]I'm fine.
[184:14.22]Keep going.
[184:14.54]I'm fine.
[184:14.72]I'm good.
[184:14.90]I'm good.
[184:15.22]I'm good.
[184:15.54]No big deal then.
[184:21.67]Gonna break out their windshield.
[184:24.27]That's not even...
[184:26.06]There's nothing I can do about it.
[184:26.94]What do you mean you can't do anything about it?
[184:28.30]Like, he just ran me into a rock.
[184:29.82]Why is this guy's car going on fire and he's still here?
[184:31.74]This is not fair!
[184:35.38]Why did I just turn around?
[184:37.50]Go this way!
[184:39.44]What are you doing?
[184:45.24]Why is this guy just snapping me around controller aim?
[184:49.02]I know, yeah.
[184:49.50]I assume I'm not gonna come back.
[184:51.90]Oh my god.
[184:54.28]Oh dear.
[184:57.59]How much further do we have to go?
[184:58.69]We're about to be in a tunnel, so I assume not much further.
[185:03.09]Alright, we're good.
[185:08.76]How do I reload?
[185:09.40]I don't know, haven't you shot like 30 times now?
[185:13.72]Oh yeah, that was a good shot.
[185:18.24]Oh shit.
[185:22.62]It's total chaos, I love it.
[185:30.32]I thought you could take us off the edge there for a second.
[185:33.24]Hey, good driving, though.
[185:34.75]Oh, thanks, man.
[185:35.29]You've done a good job so far.
[185:39.69]Feeling pretty confident right now.
[185:42.37]Yeah, we're good.
[185:44.13]He's gonna... We'll do.
[185:45.69]These cars weigh 500 million pounds.
[185:48.81]Yeah, they do.
[185:51.84]Hold on!
[185:56.46]Can I shoot that guy?
[185:58.70]Oh, I couldn't even pull the trigger.
[186:00.81]So we're good, right?
[186:02.87]Uh, maybe.
[186:03.45]Wow.
[186:04.79]What are you guys doing down here?
[186:06.69]This is just a VR demo.
[186:10.87]That's all this is.
[186:11.65]Alright, we're good.
[186:17.55]Oh no.
[186:18.51]Spikes are out.
[186:27.39]Hey, we get to do my plan from earlier and go under the bridge.
[186:30.95]Like, we're gonna stop now.
[186:32.31]Okay.
[186:32.85]No more guns?
[186:33.43]No guns?
[186:33.97]You lost your shotgun, man.
[186:36.13]Yeah, that's not cool.
[186:37.13]It's out of ammo.
[186:50.29]Get to the canoe.
[186:51.13]Yeah, we're going to get out of here with a canoe.
[186:52.75]That works.
[186:53.83]Can't wait.
[186:54.95]All right.
[186:59.95]Do you want to take bets on whether there's a waterfall?
[187:02.95]I will take bets on that.
[187:04.01]I think there'll be a waterfall.
[187:12.28]Yeah.
[187:14.26]Very peaceful.
[187:14.82]Oh, relaxing.
[187:16.18]Yeah.
[187:20.37]That's very pretty looking.
[187:21.91]Because it's pre-rendered.
[187:22.66]So do I steer a new, uh, row?
[187:30.51]I think we both, this is going to be co-op rowing.
[187:32.29]This isn't going to work.
[187:34.43]This is like a demo of a Wii game.
[187:38.17]Welcome to another edition which we will not be able to get this done.
[187:42.20]It's going to take a thousand tries.
[187:44.62]Okay, yeah, that works actually.
[187:45.92]Ready, so, ready?
[187:46.90]Go.
[187:47.02]Go.
[187:47.10]It does.
[187:47.34]How do you know?
[187:54.74]It actually moves the boat, surprisingly.
[187:56.44]You're a clever guy, Leo.
[187:57.87]Alright, now we actually have to turn.
[187:59.93]Now you have to turn.
[188:00.53]Why are you going?
[188:01.03]You turned in the opposite direction.
[188:02.99]Oh, come on.
[188:03.73]We had a better opportunity to go to the left.
[188:07.77]I really saw something, though.
[188:09.38]Harder.
[188:09.76]Probably a fish.
[188:10.98]Further.
[188:11.58]Whatever.
[188:11.98]Remind us not to play Sea of Thieves.
[188:13.66]Alright, ready?
[188:14.10]Just go straight.
[188:15.10]You know what?
[188:16.50]Could have been a crocodile.
[188:18.02]There you go, straight.
[188:18.96]There's your waterfall you were looking for.
[188:21.31]Well, watch out then.
[188:24.02]Okay, straight ahead.
[188:25.52]You stay on that side.
[188:27.52]No, we're good.
[188:27.92]We just go back and forth.
[188:32.04]Hey, Benson.
[188:32.74]Yeah?
[188:34.00]We need speed, man.
[188:34.64]There are probably bears in these woods.
[188:36.46]Left or right?
[188:36.86]Which way?
[188:37.13]There are probably bears in these waters, Leo.
[188:38.43]Right.
[188:38.71]Ha!
[188:39.61]Like I'd believe that.
[188:42.43]Yeah, you were saying this really is just fill this game with Wii minigames from two people.
[188:47.33]Yeah, but it's like fun though.
[188:48.81]No, it is.
[188:50.67]It's not like the kind... What's nice about it is that it ends.
[188:55.52]Whereas with the Wii minigame, you bought it at Walmart thinking all of your family was gonna like it and now you're stuck with it after you played it once.
[189:02.13]This is true.
[189:10.34]It's better than just walking in a straight line.
[189:12.50]You know what I mean?
[189:13.04]Watch that corner.
[189:16.25]This is the river rapids level.
[189:18.19]Yeah.
[189:18.83]There always has to be a water level.
[189:20.19]Watch out for the rock.
[189:22.41]Uh, yeah.
[189:24.83]Get this big one.
[189:25.51]Hmm, we're fine.
[189:33.24]For some reason we're picking the extremely difficult side.
[189:35.78]This is the difficult side.
[189:41.80]Okay.
[189:44.52]I'd stay right for this one, for sure.
[189:46.32]That looks like a pretty big dip on the left.
[189:50.13]No kidding.
[189:50.59]Yeah, like this one.
[189:54.81]Like the one you're watching.
[189:57.43]Oh, that did a lot of damage.
[190:00.95]Realistically.
[190:03.84]Look at the boat.
[190:05.66]That was a big hit.
[190:06.28]Yeah, this thing is getting destroyed.
[190:11.89]Wouldn't it be fast if I just jumped in and swam?
[190:14.98]Yeah, sure.
[190:15.98]You try that.
[190:17.02]I'll just stay in the boat.
[190:20.60]I think we're through the worst of it.
[190:22.60]The rest is just a smooth ride.
[190:25.98]I think you spoke too soon, Leo.
[190:27.76]Here it is.
[190:29.54]Here it is.
[190:31.85]Can't have water without a waterfall.
[190:34.15]So what do we do about this?
[190:37.72]Oh, we need to steer.
[190:38.48]We need to steer.
[190:39.34]Alright, you're good.
[190:40.86]You got it.
[190:41.58]What do you mean, I got it?
[190:42.48]Like, I'm helping.
[190:45.56]That would have destroyed the boat.
[190:50.54]Hard right.
[190:52.32]Harder right.
[190:52.78]This is a very hard right.
[190:53.52]This is almost a U-turn.
[190:59.40]I wish this game was multiplayer.
[191:01.73]Wish what?
[191:02.37]I wish this game was multiplayer.
[191:03.49]We'd play as two other pieces.
[191:05.19]Oh.
[191:05.75]Like...
[191:07.41]Are they the cops or are they other escapees?
[191:09.53]No, they're other escapees.
[191:10.39]They're playing their own co-op game, but we're playing our co-op game.
[191:13.47]And we're fighting together.
[191:14.27]They're like Survivor.
[191:15.67]Yeah.
[191:19.03]Oh, of course there's a rock in the middle.
[191:20.41]No, we're going right for that rock.
[191:22.03]Sideways.
[191:23.89]Uh-oh.
[191:24.09]Now we happen to be backwards.
[191:25.65]I don't think we're supposed to be this direction.
[191:27.51]I don't think so.
[191:29.01]Spin us around.
[191:29.59]No, spin us around this way.
[191:30.97]With the current.
[191:31.57]With the current.
[191:32.03]You're going to go on a full 360?
[191:34.18]Oh, come on!
[191:36.70]No!
[191:38.12]Watch out!
[191:38.60]This is just a little stick at this point, a little piece of brittle lumber.
[191:42.44]No, operation, operation.
[191:43.78]Don't touch the side of the hemoglobin.
[191:46.19]The fuck?
[191:49.07]Cut it!
[191:49.79]Cut it!
[191:51.85]No!
[191:52.53]We're dead!
[191:53.47]Too far!
[191:54.55]Too far!
[191:55.93]Wow, we got a cutscene.
[191:57.08]It saved our life.
[191:57.96]It saved it.
[192:02.02]We actually got a life saved by that cutscene.
[192:03.34]Oh, you're gonna save me.
[192:04.14]Oh, Jesus.
[192:05.39]You gotta save me.
[192:06.55]How am I supposed to do that?
[192:07.57]I'm coming.
[192:13.54]You have to come over here.
[192:15.32]I'm on my way.
[192:18.06]It's getting a little slippery.
[192:21.46]They really are playing the Survivor music.
[192:27.67]What happened?
[192:29.89]Is that supposed to happen?
[192:31.31]I just assumed you did that on purpose.
[192:33.11]I did not do that on purpose.
[192:34.47]That just happens.
[192:35.68]Grab my hand!
[192:39.50]Come on, grab it!
[192:46.00]I feel like I'm playing Doom Raider right now.
[192:49.29]Come on!
[192:54.63]We did it!
[192:56.13]Nice hero.
[193:01.10]You okay?
[193:02.02]I'm okay.
[193:03.74]Let's get out of here.
[193:04.62]Uncharted.
[193:09.02]Wait, is this game supposed to be about prison?
[193:12.18]It was.
[193:12.56]I mean, the police are still chasing us.
[193:17.15]You think it stops when you get out of the jail cell?
[193:19.77]It keeps going.
[193:20.89]You gotta get a new passport.
[193:22.43]You gotta get a new driver's license.
[193:24.31]A new name.
[193:26.09]You gotta get a new apartment.
[193:29.19]New alias.
[193:30.79]Yeah, that is a question.
[193:31.79]What does happen now?
[193:33.27]Where do we go from here for the video game?
[193:36.15]We gotta take down Harvey.
[193:39.03]Do we?
[193:40.31]Yeah.
[193:41.60]I mean, he's the whole point of the game.
[193:43.62]Woohoo!
[193:43.96]Bless you.
[193:45.54]Thank you.
[193:46.96]I'm telling you, it's me.
[193:58.31]We're gonna have to make a decision at the end of the game.
[194:00.39]Do we kill Harvey or not?
[194:01.65]I'm telling you it's me.
[194:03.81]Everyone made fun of me.
[194:06.51]But if you kill him, you get like arrested and thrown back in prison.
[194:09.05]No, it's gonna be me.
[194:09.77]They already showed him.
[194:13.73]Yeah, they showed me.
[194:16.63]I had a little bit of surgery.
[194:26.79]Are you doubling down on this now?
[194:28.23]I am.
[194:29.01]I had surgery.
[194:29.73]It's my twin brother.
[194:30.81]Alright, we're in the flashback.
[194:34.97]This is the lore.
[194:35.89]Here's the lore.
[194:36.55]Here it comes.
[194:37.15]He's gonna be... Pay attention.
[194:38.55]Listen, if you only pay attention to one scene, it's probably this one.
[194:41.69]Because I guarantee you there's gonna be a decision at the end of the game.
[194:45.10]And we're gonna have to make based on the information in this cutscene.
[194:49.78]Okay.
[194:50.20]Guarantee it.
[194:51.58]There he is.
[194:51.96]There's Harvey.
[194:52.42]There I am.
[194:54.10]It's your clone.
[195:04.97]Yeah, and the other guy's not even here.
[195:06.97]It's all there.
[195:08.09]Count it.
[195:10.99]Nice car.
[195:15.13]John Wick.
[195:15.79]That's not Harvey.
[195:17.55]No.
[195:18.90]Looks about right.
[195:19.90]That's Harvey on the right.
[195:20.94]No, that's not Harvey.
[195:24.66]I doubt he theft.
[195:25.26]I took his name.
[195:25.66]Of course it is.
[195:26.16]You can always trust me.
[195:27.68]I'm not trusting nobody, my friend.
[195:37.06]Here you go.
[195:38.70]The golden gun.
[195:40.55]What do you think?
[195:43.79]It's the diamond again.
[195:47.21]It's heavier than I thought it is.
[195:53.96]Pleasure doing business with you guys.
[195:55.66]Guy's got, like, a briefcase with three mil.
[195:58.18]And he didn't even... Give me the case!
[196:01.92]What the fuck are you doing?
[196:03.46]Give me the fucking case, Leo!
[196:06.31]Uh, alright.
[196:09.77]And then we're gonna start talking at the same time.
[196:17.73]Give me the briefcase.
[196:18.61]We're gonna start talking.
[196:19.35]This is Tyler Durden from Fight Club again.
[196:25.06]Spoilers.
[196:28.58]Didn't do the QTE fast enough.
[196:34.88]Can't do it over.
[196:37.59]How would they even pin it on him though?
[196:43.36]Wouldn't they be able to tell he shot him with like a desert eagle?
[196:49.66]And there's no gun on the scene?
[196:53.32]Yeah, some daytime TV show would be able to figure that out, not us.
[197:03.80]What are we waiting for?
[197:05.80]Not to mention the rubber trail from the tires spinning out.
[197:13.10]Yeah, something before and after the price is right would be able to figure that out for you.
[197:16.97]Like I said, with or without you, I'm going after him.
[197:23.47]See you in this game?
[197:23.99]It'd be funny if we could just do two completely separate games.
[197:28.18]You go after him and I go do something else.
[197:29.88]Still split screen.
[197:31.10]Okay.
[197:32.58]Oh, like you go play horseshoes while I go catch the guy who got you in prison?
[197:39.02]Don't worry, he's going to be easy to find.
[197:41.12]But I need to make sure my family's safe first.
[197:44.08]Of course.
[197:46.60]Let's go.
[197:52.98]Questioning logic in a game with a canoe getaway.
[197:55.52]That's true.
[198:00.49]But that's what makes it great.
[198:01.77]Those are like moments of greatness, though.
[198:03.65]Mm-hmm.
[198:05.57]What cereal is that?
[198:06.01]You can get Sugar Rush.
[198:07.33]Sugar Rush?
[198:09.89]Oh, kids these days, am I right?
[198:11.21]Marshmallows.
[198:11.95]Don't go too far, Alex.
[198:14.17]Sounds kinda good.
[198:17.17]It's the cereal, but with all the cereal removed.
[198:20.33]Mom!
[198:24.13]What is it, honey?
[198:27.01]What's wrong?
[198:28.69]Captain Crunch.
[198:38.01]Uh-oh.
[198:40.31]Uh, well, you're in trouble.
[198:42.23]Alex?
[198:43.32]Alex?
[198:43.56]Little Alex saw you in the newspaper.
[198:46.24]He can read as well.
[198:47.84]He knew that that said fugitive at large.
[198:50.54]Well, he wasn't like two.
[198:52.42]He was like probably... It's like five.
[198:54.40]The kid was like five or six.
[198:55.93]You can read at five.
[198:57.61]No, you can't.
[198:58.27]Yes, you can.
[198:58.73]No, you can't.
[199:00.09]Yes, you can.
[199:00.93]Like smart kids that go into advanced classes can read at five.
[199:04.05]When do you learn to read?
[199:05.35]We've always been together.
[199:08.38]Uh, your child's ability to recognize different colors heats up around 18 months.
[199:18.21]Hold on.
[199:19.53]It'll be a while longer before he's able to name the colors.
[199:21.91]Most children can name at least one color by three.
[199:25.55]Okay.
[199:26.61]Can three-year-olds read?
[199:28.31]The years between ages three and five are critical to reading growth, and some five-year-olds are already in kindergarten.
[199:34.81]All right, go ask your kindergarten class, uh, class, what does fugitive at large mean?
[199:40.10]And see how many, like, real answers you get.
[199:41.82]That kid is also supposed to be 10.
[199:44.60]When did you learn to read?
[199:45.34]He's just a little Overwatch kid.
[200:11.66]Low rates, no pets.
[200:13.55]Swimming pool is under construction at the moment.
[200:22.19]How do you think that kid was five?
[200:24.41]Because when you increase over the age of 25, every person under the age of 18 is the same age.
[200:34.22]More importantly, let's describe the fact that we have to... Why can't I just go walk into the house?
[200:39.81]What was the last cutscene about in the plane?
[200:43.63]Uh, I don't know.
[200:44.77]It's got a roof.
[200:45.11]Alright, split up.
[200:46.51]We'll find the house.
[200:47.27]Uh, yeah.
[200:47.50]I think... Oh, man.
[200:47.90]Oh, man.
[200:48.08]Get over here.
[200:48.98]This is fucking amazing.
[200:49.54]Which way did you go?
[200:50.14]Oh, you're all the way down there?
[200:52.28]You see what we can do?
[200:52.96]We can play baseball.
[201:11.69]I'm coming.
[201:12.23]I'm gonna play more mini-games here.
[201:14.69]I think I can only hit... Oh man, more just Sims games?
[201:30.36]How do you swing, though, R2?
[201:31.06]Okay, that's... That's odd.
[201:32.48]I'm like trying to have a heart-to-heart with this old man.
[201:37.24]Oh, my God.
[201:39.00]There we go.
[201:39.69]All right, you got to swing very early.
[201:42.97]That was a foul?
[201:43.79]Just how far are you going to hit the ball?
[201:47.09]This guy is just creeping right behind you.
[202:00.63]Don't walk in front of the game.
[202:01.81]Hey, we're playing a game here, buddy.
[202:07.33]Hi there.
[202:07.69]Alright, let's do it.
[202:08.71]You can put a sprint on that ball.
[202:23.26]Whoops.
[202:24.82]Hey, you started with points.
[202:25.86]I don't think you deserve those.
[202:26.98]No, no, that's not points.
[202:28.58]Oh, sorry.
[202:29.56]That's just a grand slam home run.
[202:31.98]Over the bridge.
[202:33.70]Damn it.
[202:36.32]Careful.
[202:38.20]Watch it.
[202:40.40]I'm going to need to stand behind a net.
[202:44.68]Good hit.
[202:46.04]That would hit you right in the fucking head.
[202:48.17]Why is this guy still standing?
[202:49.65]I can't throw you a ball.
[202:51.03]It's just strikes only.
[202:55.33]There we go.
[202:56.87]Oh, that's... Oh, to the moon!
[203:02.18]Bitcoin!
[203:02.78]Crypto!
[203:03.30]God.
[203:03.84]Kill me, please.
[203:09.33]Oh, no.
[203:09.97]He says it.
[203:10.73]He actually said it.
[203:12.21]I thought you were saying it.
[203:14.42]No, it was him.
[203:15.38]What, you thought I said that?
[203:16.70]I thought you... I can't throw a ball.
[203:20.20]It's just going to be a strike every time.
[203:23.18]No, he... That killed that guy.
[203:25.32]All right, your turn.
[203:26.88]Your turn.
[203:28.82]Sure.
[203:29.38]Nice batting.
[203:31.92]Keep fidgeting.
[203:36.78]Hey, that's dangerous.
[203:37.90]Thanks.
[203:38.54]You're welcome.
[203:40.36]My turn.
[203:40.56]Your turn to hit.
[203:42.00]Pitching is like... Hey.
[203:44.50]Hey.
[203:44.82]Pretty boring.
[203:45.32]I would love to sneak up behind this guy and chill.
[203:46.88]Yeah, sure.
[203:47.44]Here you go.
[203:49.46]Sure thing.
[203:50.34]Here.
[203:50.94]Thanks.
[203:51.78]Reminds me of my childhood.
[203:54.00]Where's the button?
[203:56.40]Oh, now I see why you were having problems.
[204:00.21]Nice.
[204:03.05]God.
[204:04.31]You literally just click the button as soon as you see the... What, you can't handle it?
[204:17.62]You didn't miss, you just followed it.
[204:21.80]Do you have an aim with the thumbstick?
[204:23.86]I am now.
[204:24.87]Just trying to throw you off.
[204:25.65]I mean, that's the batter.
[204:27.25]Oh, I don't think so.
[204:27.93]I hope he says to the moon.
[204:35.68]Why are my points going up so much faster than yours?
[204:38.60]I've only hit it like five times.
[204:40.46]It's distance.
[204:42.04]I think it's how far you hit the last one.
[204:45.11]Why is it so unnecessarily difficult?
[204:49.11]Because it is.
[204:50.49]You already hit one more.
[204:56.38]No, got to hit one more.
[204:59.38]There it is.
[204:59.84]To the moon.
[205:00.20]There we go.
[205:02.18]All right.
[205:03.28]Any more fun games to play in a way out of the carnival?
[205:08.33]This is why I quit playing Little League.
[205:12.91]Couldn't keep my eye on the ball.
[205:16.77]Your family's probably in here.
[205:18.33]More random games.
[205:19.71]Excuse me.
[205:20.45]Quick question.
[205:21.31]Hang on.
[205:25.58]What's up?
[205:26.54]Kind of busy.
[205:27.48]You know where my family lives?
[205:29.08]But I'm wondering if you've seen a 30-something woman with a kid this tall?
[205:35.04]Really, I just chill.
[205:36.37]Why am I hammering you?
[205:37.39]You just pick things up and just hit.
[205:39.15]It's just a child simulator.
[205:41.33]Uh-oh.
[205:44.37]I didn't want to go out here yet.
[205:45.89]Oh, it's little Alex.
[205:47.13]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[205:47.77]No, no, no, don't run away.
[205:49.67]What do you mean run away?
[205:50.49]He doesn't want to see you.
[205:51.47]Let's check it out.
[205:53.15]You make me run all the way directly to baseball and I get to see if there's any other minigame over here.
[205:57.73]Help!
[205:59.42]No.
[206:06.46]No, you.
[206:09.30]Negative.
[206:11.64]That's another baseball.
[206:13.31]Wait, is that my wife?
[206:15.93]Grill.
[206:16.25]Grill.
[206:17.03]Grill.
[206:21.01]I finally found a burger.
[206:23.66]Smells great.
[206:25.64]Can I just steal one, please?
[206:26.88]No, you can't.
[206:27.70]All you can do is lift it up and put it down.
[206:28.98]Hey, help me out.
[206:33.03]You look upset.
[206:34.23]Oh, I am.
[206:35.27]I'm waiting for my goddamn husband.
[206:37.34]He probably is your wife.
[206:40.06]That is my wife.
[206:43.80]What did he do?
[206:44.64]I don't know.
[206:45.18]Where is he?
[206:46.74]He's been cheating on me.
[206:48.59]Oh, apparently.
[206:50.25]Are you absolutely sure you did that?
[206:52.69]Of course I'm sure.
[206:53.49]I can smell when people are cheating on me.
[206:55.61]You do have an odor.
[207:00.66]Alright, what?
[207:01.14]Are you really just going to stand there and wait?
[207:03.02]What else do you want to do?
[207:04.18]There's a playset here.
[207:05.34]Yeah, you can't even run up that slide.
[207:10.43]Told you.
[207:10.79]Okay, you got me there.
[207:12.75]You can't even go on a swing.
[207:13.81]Oh, god damn it.
[207:15.81]Oh, come on.
[207:17.51]Fucking hell.
[207:18.09]Gosh.
[207:18.31]It's going to open the secret room.
[207:22.75]It's deaf.
[207:26.85]I need a friend.
[207:28.41]Waiting on a friend.
[207:29.33]Where are you?
[207:30.07]Over there.
[207:30.49]Right in front of you.
[207:31.17]Oh, God.
[207:34.61]Don't sound so dejected.
[207:35.89]I mean, it is dejected.
[207:39.46]Why are we sizing this thing up?
[207:41.50]I don't think we can get on this.
[207:42.76]Oh, come on.
[207:43.38]Are you serious?
[207:45.48]Why?
[207:46.90]Minus one.
[207:48.10]Hold on.
[207:49.98]All we can do is look at it.
[207:52.48]Why would that even be an interaction button?
[207:55.97]They must've just done it just to make you feel bad.
[208:01.07]Same time, maybe we have to sync it, sync it up.
[208:03.09]We definitely did.
[208:04.68]Just do it for real, sync it completely.
[208:06.58]All right, just to put it at rest.
[208:13.51]Ready?
[208:14.45]Three, two, one, go.
[208:17.27]Look at that.
[208:18.23]Wow.
[208:22.50]Can we move it?
[208:23.02]What?
[208:23.18]No.
[208:23.32]Come on.
[208:24.22]We can't do it.
[208:25.40]Good enough.
[208:25.86]Good enough.
[208:26.80]I'll take it.
[208:27.20]Point restored.
[208:30.21]You sat down first.
[208:54.44]Really, with the trash?
[208:58.54]I'm just looking.
[208:59.76]Help me move that thing.
[209:01.12]What about that guy on the roof?
[209:02.58]He's got to be something.
[209:03.52]That guy on the roof is just an NPC for funny.
[209:06.66]All right.
[209:07.50]It's right when you come in, you can look over and see the guy messing with the roof.
[209:09.81]Listen, we're just trying to... You know what?
[209:11.09]Just sometimes... I've already talked to that guy.
[209:12.69]We already did the baseball.
[209:15.41]We're looking for material here, okay?
[209:16.91]We're not... You know what?
[209:17.59]It's not a race.
[209:18.97]Who are these people?
[209:20.23]I can't even go over here.
[209:22.83]The junkies.
[209:23.95]Ignore them.
[209:25.25]Alright, but that's my son!
[209:26.95]That's my son!
[209:28.71]That's my son!
[209:29.57]That is not your son.
[209:30.43]Yes, it is!
[209:31.43]No, it's not.
[209:32.07]What?
[209:33.49]That's the same character model as your son, probably.
[209:38.94]But it's not him.
[209:40.20]Oh.
[209:40.34]Your son was wearing, like, green clothes.
[209:43.26]Alright, well, let's go.
[209:44.80]I'm ahead of you.
[209:54.03]Finding Nemo.
[209:55.23]Where are you going?
[210:03.03]This is Ben Stiller from every Ben Stiller movie you've ever watched.
[210:09.18]That's Ben Stiller's comedy character from every one of his movies.
[210:12.85]What if we could just end the game by working at this auto repair shop?
[210:20.58]Maybe you could.
[210:23.94]Just wait 15 minutes until Far Cry 4 ends.
[210:26.02]I bet they'd do that again.
[210:31.40]Sean, get the clock.
[210:34.67]I'm here.
[210:39.61]Speaking of Far Cry, am I right, guys?
[210:41.90]It's coming out in like four days or something, right?
[210:44.81]Uh, yes.
[210:45.97]That's gonna be fun.
[210:47.69]Hey, Linda!
[210:49.07]Capital F, you in.
[210:50.99]Hey!
[210:51.85]See, it's the same kid.
[210:52.93]She's gonna slap you.
[210:54.07]Guaranteed.
[210:54.53]Uh-oh.
[210:55.43]Never mind.
[210:58.02]We have to hide.
[210:59.78]We're gonna have a fun thing called hide in the refrigerator or something, right?
[211:09.16]Afternoon, ma'am.
[211:10.81]Everything all right around here?
[211:12.13]What do you want?
[211:14.17]Mind if we ask you a few questions?
[211:16.41]Yeah, I do mind.
[211:17.41]I'm kind of busy here.
[211:18.57]Ma'am, your husband is broken out of prison.
[211:22.74]Stop calling me ma'am, okay?
[211:24.90]I have no clue where he is.
[211:26.50]Listen, if he tries to make contact with you, you let us know.
[211:30.24]Yeah, sure.
[211:36.18]Like, she could have answered that honestly if we had been 30 seconds later.
[211:39.87]Yeah.
[211:40.83]Yeah.
[211:42.21]Even five seconds later.
[211:43.82]Mm-hmm.
[211:44.88]Why is that cop wearing a fake beard?
[211:46.52]That's true.
[211:48.44]Don't ask me why.
[211:49.84]Because he has a baby face and nobody on the force respects him.
[211:53.51]Fake beard.
[212:04.19]That was a weird kiss.
[212:07.61]I mean, she has to get around the nose.
[212:09.85]I mean, what do you want?
[212:11.15]Huh?
[212:15.79]What?
[212:16.47]Didn't afford a voice actor for him.
[212:23.11]No, he already talked.
[212:27.76]Don't worry, Leo.
[212:29.46]He's just a little bit upset.
[212:31.32]They do more than seven lines after unionize.
[212:36.66]I don't know.
[212:36.98]You gotta enter SAG if the kid says more than four words.
[212:41.09]It's okay, baby.
[212:42.25]Come here.
[212:46.19]So, is this the guy?
[212:49.35]Yeah, this is Vincent.
[212:52.15]Nice to meet you, ma'am.
[212:54.13]Hey.
[212:55.00]Linda, I need to tell you what's going down.
[212:57.54]Very respectful.
[212:58.52]Yes, but first, you need to go talk to Alex.
[213:01.72]Of course.
[213:02.08]Handle your family matters, man.
[213:03.16]All right, again, we're going to increase the letter grade again if that motorcycle is drivable with both of us on it.
[213:12.07]Okay.
[213:13.33]I think it kind of has to be.
[213:14.83]This is some foreshadowing right here.
[213:16.49]If that motorcycle is rideable and drivable.
[213:18.77]Where else are we going to go?
[213:21.07]But before we go... No, no, no, you went too soon.
[213:23.85]What do you mean I went too soon?
[213:24.93]I'll be out here.
[213:26.85]Good luck.
[213:28.01]You have fun.
[213:28.71]I'm gonna go play with more toys.
[213:31.15]I'm playing with toys.
[213:32.17]Dude, I really should just title this stream... A Way Out, colon, Playing With Toys.
[213:37.75]Because that's the whole game.
[213:38.77]Bullseye.
[213:40.20]This is awful!
[213:43.50]All the line work!
[213:44.96]People don't look like that!
[213:46.20]Wow!
[214:00.17]Pretty realistic.
[214:01.41]Good graphics.
[214:05.07]This is a terrible manga.
[214:09.79]Rude.
[214:10.31]I'm just kidding.
[214:11.09]Of course it's a good job.
[214:13.15]I got a place.
[214:18.17]I got something to do.
[214:19.39]You get some cigarettes to smoke.
[214:20.81]That's an already lit cigarette and you're lighting it again.
[214:22.75]Hope it tastes good.
[214:25.77]They didn't even ask if I could bum one.
[214:30.21]Hey, Alex.
[214:31.63]Leave me alone.
[214:32.51]He's gonna- What the- What?
[214:35.19]We're gonna have to catch your kid for you.
[214:36.57]Why does he keep having funny escapes?
[214:43.22]Uh, kid- Don't- Uh, son, don't- Somebody stop that kid from- Okay.
[214:48.70]Isn't this a sombering moment?
[215:00.30]I have to go to this treehouse.
[215:04.09]I'm like dealing with family problems.
[215:10.11]Anything else?
[215:10.49]Oh, look, it's the sword that you opened.
[215:11.69]Alright.
[215:16.39]Am I actually drinking this?
[215:17.71]I think I'm just faking it.
[215:21.63]That's it, right?
[215:22.91]Alright, I gotta go to the treehouse.
[215:23.95]Just bear with me.
[215:26.95]Don't worry, she needs some help.
[215:27.91]I'm gonna help her.
[215:28.70]You help her, I'm gonna go talk to my son.
[215:30.24]Ma'am, I have extensive experience gathering wrenches.
[215:36.26]Yes, you do.
[215:36.60]That's all I had to do?
[215:37.84]Easy.
[215:37.96]Let's get up there.
[215:38.68]Climb up the treehouse.
[215:54.12]Come on, buddy.
[215:55.61]Come on, just let me up.
[215:57.51]Alex.
[215:58.61]Hey.
[215:59.83]Please tell me I gotta climb the tree.
[216:02.59]This is a series of being avoided by a kid.
[216:07.48]Hey, look, your sign is broken.
[216:13.89]Why don't you come down and help me fix it?
[216:18.65]Like my character thinks you're still in the house because he hasn't seen you come out yet.
[216:24.11]You're like crawled out through the side.
[216:27.74]I think I'm gonna need a hammer.
[216:29.54]Oh god, no more like go get a hammer and... There's a tool man, you gotta... You just kicked that into the road!
[216:39.72]You're gonna cause a fucking three car pileup.
[216:43.56]That'll teach you to run away from daddy.
[216:47.42]You just caused like four people to die.
[216:56.60]Oh, this sign is beautiful.
[216:58.70]Alex, you should come down and see it.
[217:03.81]Is he warming up to us?
[217:06.15]Whoops.
[217:07.63]I'm getting eclipsed.
[217:08.99]Say goodbye to your minigame.
[217:09.97]Hope you had fun playing.
[217:15.13]That was a good kick, though.
[217:18.11]Comes back, you both lying on the ground dead.
[217:26.77]I love you, buddy.
[217:28.73]I love you so much.
[217:29.97]Okay, I was looking over at chat.
[217:32.09]One second I looked over, I thought he was as tall as me.
[217:34.49]I was like, that doesn't make any sense.
[217:36.49]Why is he this tall?
[217:38.31]He's huge.
[217:38.97]No, you're not.
[217:40.18]Has he been walking down on his knees?
[217:43.18]He's on stilts.
[217:44.30]You want to ride the bicycle?
[217:45.70]That could be fun, but maybe we should get going.
[217:48.32]No!
[217:48.98]Basketball!
[217:51.02]Come on, Dad!
[217:52.36]Sorry, I think I kicked him into the street, though.
[217:57.49]Yeah, you did, you kicked him into the... We can't play basketball together.
[218:02.85]This game seriously is just... ...do mundane shit together.
[218:07.47]Relaxing with two people.
[218:08.81]Alright.
[218:10.37]Pass.
[218:10.51]Shoot.
[218:10.63]Hey, watch this one, son.
[218:24.48]All right, make this little kid play defense.
[218:27.40]How do you know my name?
[218:28.14]I don't know.
[218:30.08]I'm going to guard.
[218:32.94]No, don't let him have it.
[218:36.14]All right, give me, give me, give me, give me that kid.
[218:39.98]Give me the ball, kid.
[218:42.32]That's right.
[218:43.02]Did you just take it?
[218:47.56]You just did the meanest thing you could possibly do.
[218:50.62]You just did the wicked mean.
[218:52.22]Steal a ball from a kid and dunk on him.
[218:55.08]And dunk on him too.
[219:00.22]I'm never going to get that.
[219:01.06]What the fuck?
[219:06.72]We're just like having fun as adults.
[219:10.28]He tried to get...
[219:15.73]Oh, look at that!
[219:17.01]From three!
[219:18.87]Give me that fucking ball!
[219:21.28]Oh, no.
[219:22.94]Here, you can play too now.
[219:23.88]Wasn't that fun?
[219:28.38]That was fun.
[219:29.26]You think?
[219:30.74]Yeah, you should become a pro.
[219:32.90]Really?
[219:33.26]I'll be right back.
[219:34.90]Slam dunking on her.
[219:38.71]Like, how much of an egomaniac do you have to be to, like, do that to, like, a child?
[219:44.13]That's so funny.
[219:46.85]I thought you... Okay, I thought you had a... I just thought you had, like, a weapon.
[219:51.72]You had your... You were holding your hands out.
[219:54.00]He's trying to, like, play deep.
[220:02.65]So, this is home now?
[220:04.88]Not for long.
[220:06.06]He can't even play.
[220:09.18]You know what?
[220:11.43]Where are we going?
[220:12.15]Let's just leave.
[220:13.05]Let's get out of here.
[220:14.81]And you really think Harvey will leave us alone?
[220:17.75]That murdering bastard.
[220:19.97]Go get it.
[220:20.95]You guys are so bad at this.
[220:22.69]Go get it.
[220:23.61]This is what happens when you spin around in a circle a hundred times and try to play basketball.
[220:28.03]Holy shit.
[220:29.40]That was further than I just did.
[220:30.64]Nice alley-oop.
[220:32.16]I'm going after Harvey.
[220:34.12]He's not going to get away with this.
[220:38.00]That's so much more interesting than what's going on over here.
[220:40.08]Linda, any idea where Ray is?
[220:43.76]Ray?
[220:44.54]What do you want with that asshole?
[220:46.42]I need to find him.
[220:47.68]I'm sure he knows where Harvey's hiding.
[220:49.00]I wanted to shoot some more.
[220:50.10]Oh, that's fucking funny.
[220:51.92]He's working at that new construction site downtown.
[220:54.97]Okay, good.
[220:56.03]Just... I need you to be ready to leave the country as soon as I'm back.
[221:00.35]Don't worry about that.
[221:01.19]I'll take care of it.
[221:02.75]You just make sure to get back safe, okay?
[221:04.81]Yeah.
[221:05.37]Now don't just yell at me.
[221:06.89]Get back safe or I'll kick your ass.
[221:09.16]Okay, I promise.
[221:10.86]By the way, do you still have that piece?
[221:13.56]Oh, I get a gun?
[221:14.54]Uh-oh.
[221:15.10]No, it's gonna be the jewel.
[221:19.07]Or the gun.
[221:19.87]You get a gun.
[221:20.71]Well, a piece.
[221:21.23]But she had the jewel, though.
[221:23.05]Yeah, a piece is a gun.
[221:23.81]A piece is a gun.
[221:25.63]No, I agree.
[221:26.09]Oh, my God, and it's huge.
[221:28.53]I love you.
[221:36.24]Thanks, baby.
[221:38.99]That gave me a big smooch.
[221:41.23]I'm gonna wait outside for this one.
[221:42.67]Smoke a little bit more, I think.
[221:43.92]Can I tell you that I love you, baby?
[221:46.48]How'd they get that camera shot?
[221:48.34]What a good dad.
[221:52.94]Leave me to babysit.
[221:55.51]You can score.
[221:58.51]Hey, thanks for coming for ten minutes.
[222:01.77]Yeah, I do.
[222:03.25]But you take care of your mom now, alright?
[222:05.64]Can we play one more game?
[222:06.88]Next time, I promise.
[222:08.84]Now come on, give me a hug.
[222:09.86]And he didn't come back for like 10 more years.
[222:13.84]All right, buddy.
[222:15.65]Go to your mom now.
[222:16.83]Okay.
[222:19.01]I like that.
[222:19.59]I want that alligator shirt.
[222:22.55]I like that shirt.
[222:23.39]I want that in like an adult male size.
[222:26.29]With the shorts.
[222:30.37]Only as it becomes this one complete outfit.
[222:32.31]It becomes this one complete outfit, and it's a onesie.
[222:35.21]I have to slip into that and zip it up.
[222:37.29]All right, here we go.
[222:44.65]You sure this Ray guy will give us Harvey's location?
[222:51.02]He better.
[222:51.94]What if he doesn't?
[222:54.06]We're going to punch him.
[222:54.70]You will.
[222:55.42]Trust me.
[222:57.26]Don't worry, I'm bringing a gun.
[222:59.24]This way.
[223:00.80]Get the fuck out of my way.
[223:02.08]We're here to talk to someone.
[223:04.52]We're here to talk to somebody.
[223:05.40]You got a fucking problem?
[223:06.28]What do you think this is?
[223:07.68]A coffee shop?
[223:08.20]Yeah, a coffee shop.
[223:08.62]Fucking funny guy and he grabbed me by the neck.
[223:12.78]Alright, do you want to do which way?
[223:14.70]Bluff or threat?
[223:16.58]May as well let chat decide again.
[223:17.90]Alright, let's... I mean... We only get to decide which way to go like four times in the whole game.
[223:25.90]That's true, that's true.
[223:27.10]Straw poll.
[223:36.09]Bluff.
[223:38.05]Bluff or tough?
[223:42.26]Bluff or tough?
[223:47.68]I'm putting it into the chat room there for you, Mr. Talix.
[223:54.82]Here we go.
[224:04.31]Alright.
[224:05.17]Looks like... Looks like Bluff is doing a... Off to a great start here with Bluff.
[224:12.24]Yeah, Bluff is off to a... I didn't even influence the election this time.
[224:14.98]None, actually.
[224:15.70]Nobody did.
[224:18.52]Didn't spell it tough.
[224:19.34]I'm not going to spell it incorrectly.
[224:21.84]What?
[224:22.06]T-U-F-F?
[224:22.86]Yeah.
[224:23.64]That's why they didn't vote for it.
[224:24.75]You didn't spell it T-U-F-F.
[224:26.83]Tough.
[224:30.77]Yeah, I mean, Bluff is winning by, like, a long shot.
[224:32.57]Yeah, that's game over.
[224:34.01]You're not going to win.
[224:34.59]Sorry, guys.
[224:35.41]As much as I would like to tough it out, Bluff.
[224:39.75]Oh, yeah?
[224:40.35]And you're going to stop me?
[224:41.69]You'll have to excuse my colleague.
[224:43.13]He hasn't had his morning coffee yet.
[224:45.27]But he's right, though.
[224:46.65]We're here to check if this site is up to code.
[224:50.07]Jesus Christ.
[224:51.91]Another inspection?
[224:53.45]What is it with you guys?
[224:54.71]Just keep coming and coming and coming.
[224:57.76]That's how we keep you on it.
[224:59.46]That's right.
[225:00.32]The way the guy said that, you knew what he was saying.
[225:02.82]That was the same voice line three times in a row, though.
[225:05.18]Yeah.
[225:05.72]There you go.
[225:07.33]I'm not convinced that he recorded that but one time.
[225:10.45]Oh, he recorded that to be a funny guy.
[225:12.25]Absolutely.
[225:12.85]Damn inspections.
[225:14.37]How many of these guys are they going to send?
[225:15.99]God.
[225:20.01]Put your hat hat on.
[225:21.41]No joke.
[225:22.47]Yeah, nobody would believe they're inspectors.
[225:26.07]Imagine just walking onto a job site and going, I want to inspect this.
[225:29.19]What can you wear a hat in this game?
[225:31.19]I don't know, but... Go in here.
[225:32.17]Just push it over.
[225:32.71]Done.
[225:32.81]Done.
[225:33.03]Done.
[225:50.52]Look at that.
[225:58.27]That's cool.
[225:59.31]Don't do it.
[225:59.89]Yeah, don't do it.
[226:00.59]I know what you're going to say.
[226:03.97]But don't even think about it.
[226:05.65]Don't even let it purse your lips.
[226:09.71]Get out of here.
[226:17.11]I got around you.
[226:19.39]It worked.
[226:20.35]No, you didn't.
[226:21.25]I let you off.
[226:22.11]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[226:25.69]That looks like fun.
[226:26.19]Can I do it?
[226:26.98]Remember, this is the toy game.
[226:28.72]Hey.
[226:29.48]What?
[226:30.30]I can't hear you.
[226:31.92]I'm looking for your boss.
[226:33.54]My what?
[226:37.76]I want to talk to you.
[226:39.06]Can you turn that off?
[226:40.33]I can't hear you.
[226:42.07]Turn it off.
[226:43.77]I still can't hear you.
[226:46.77]Is that Gilbert Gottfried speaking?
[226:48.43]I think it was.
[226:49.51]I think it actually was.
[226:50.33]I have to quit this job before I end up a cripple.
[226:57.04]You gotta lift with your knees, not your back.
[227:00.16]My knees?
[227:01.68]Yeah, you gotta bend them.
[227:03.66]Anybody?
[227:04.56]Come in.
[227:05.40]Over.
[227:07.23]I'm pretty sure I saw this guy in the prison.
[227:09.37]This piece of shit don't work.
[227:11.13]It's called reusing player models.
[227:12.89]I think he escaped too, though.
[227:14.51]Oh.
[227:15.44]I like my way better Good job
[227:36.70]I did complain about them not being able to use the bathroom.
[227:39.52]I did.
[227:40.64]I did say it, and my guy just went, Oh, God.
[227:43.24]Like, he's been waiting to piss this whole time.
[227:44.91]He's been waiting the whole stream.
[227:46.17]Yeah!
[227:47.07]No.
[227:47.65]Did he just say, yeah, coming out?
[227:49.17]Oh, wait.
[227:49.67]Okay, here's another toy.
[227:50.95]You can't handle it.
[227:53.14]Yeah, of course I do.
[227:55.91]Hey, remember Monster Hunter?
[227:58.63]I do.
[227:59.61]Please don't be a mash game.
[228:00.95]It's gonna be a mash game.
[228:02.09]What button is it gonna be?
[228:03.03]Oh dear.
[228:03.41]What?
[228:04.01]Oh.

[228:57.54]Why not?
[228:58.22]Good choice.
[229:00.12]You can't do it against him.
[229:01.01]It's only me.
[229:01.77]Okay, come do it again.
[229:02.57]What do you mean again?
[229:04.57]You already won.
[229:05.23]What else do you want?
[229:06.24]Best one out of two.

[229:13.47]Dink him down!
[229:14.41]Yes!
[229:15.91]You win the button press competition.
[229:18.05]I'm not gonna lie, that was fucking hard.
[229:20.65]Yeah, no, it was.
[229:22.57]You're making it sound easy, but I know how fast I was pushing the button.
[229:25.45]Yeah, no, that was hard.
[229:26.29]That was not easy.
[229:28.91]Wait, what?
[229:31.35]Oh, I thought you just disappeared.
[229:36.03]What is this?
[229:36.75]What the hell am I looking at?
[229:38.63]Dipshit, can you explain this shit?
[229:40.07]Well, yeah, it looks like you just spit it out.

[229:43.84]I told you it should be four.
[229:45.14]Well, no, no, no, no, no, I, I, no.
[229:46.84]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[229:48.04]What are you, some kind of stupid?
[229:49.34]I think you misunderstand.
[229:50.58]You're a fucking idiot.
[229:51.46]Well, I, no.
[229:53.48]That's the guy.
[229:54.32]Yeah, I see.
[229:55.86]Oh, but sir.
[230:00.56]Oh, shit.
[230:00.92]We got a facial hair competition coming up.
[230:02.78]All right, we have a case to chase.
[230:03.96]Take these stairs.
[230:04.64]I'll go this way.
[230:05.79]Okay, here we go.
[230:08.39]Where am I going?
[230:10.39]Okay, I'm going up.
[230:11.35]You're going in the elevator.
[230:13.19]Oh, is that you?
[230:14.00]That's him.
[230:15.42]Wow.
[230:19.62]Coming.
[230:21.28]Come on, open.
[230:21.80]It's up to you now.
[230:22.90]There is no up to me.
[230:25.63]There is.
[230:25.91]That's a great mirror segment.
[230:33.50]Why is he so much faster than me?
[230:36.16]Are you kidding me?
[230:38.06]Is this whole thing gonna fall?
[230:45.31]Uh... Okay, I thought you had to come save me.
[230:52.75]This guy's wrecking this whole construction site!
[230:55.09]He's blowing the whole building!
[230:57.23]What do you- You could easily get out of this!
[231:04.47]Wow, I am Indiana Jones now.
[231:05.63]Yeah, hey, he's doing like 500 million dollars worth of damage.
[231:08.75]Yeah.
[231:09.95]He could have easily just snuck away.
[231:11.73]Definitely failing inspection on this one.
[231:13.73]Yeah.
[231:16.63]This is not a safe work environment.
[231:19.39]I really fucked that up.
[231:20.30]I slowed down and still slid over it.
[231:23.40]Alright, I am on top of the elevator that he went in.
[231:26.02]I'm going up.
[231:27.20]I'm above you.
[231:28.86]Or I was.
[231:32.55]Didn't even need to do that.
[231:33.41]I could've just walked to the side.
[231:39.69]Voice of Reason.
[231:40.09]Pretty sure you just racked another round.
[231:43.96]Alright, let's do it.
[231:45.08]Find... the guy in the construction site.
[232:03.61]You go up.
[232:06.13]I'll go through here.
[232:08.85]Investigate.
[232:10.31]Can't go this way.
[232:14.33]Found a shimmy segment.
[232:17.39]Okay, for a minute, I thought you were lying on your back and just sliding to the left.
[232:22.85]I didn't look over until then.
[232:25.51]That was very strange to see.
[232:30.06]I'll wait for you.
[232:40.03]it takes a long time that's a long segment man no safety first he's gonna be hiding around one of these corners yeah well here comes a let's look around he's probably hiding in here somewhere what are they doing oh it's like that painting why would you be up here
[233:01.21]Isn't that like a Norman Rockwell painting or something?
[233:03.27]I don't know, but gee, but the... No.
[233:05.89]They did this, man.
[233:06.79]Actually, this is real.
[233:08.01]No way.
[233:08.17]They did this in like the 70s.
[233:09.13]Oh, no, they did not.
[233:10.33]They just sit out there on the thing and eat lunch.
[233:13.52]That is terrifying.
[233:17.06]Wait, we're just playing hide and seek with this guy?
[233:23.26]Probably in the toilet.
[233:26.96]There is a guy in the toilet.
[233:29.68]It's the wrong guy.
[233:32.59]He's like twice in a row.
[233:37.18]No way.
[233:39.62]Twice in a row.
[233:40.98]It's a different guy opening it both times.
[233:44.40]Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
[233:48.14]Hey, come open that door.
[233:49.20]Why did you just do the Colossus from the X-Men game in the arcade?
[233:55.17]I can't even do it.
[233:56.57]Can you do that again?
[233:57.51]No, I only opened the door once.
[234:01.22]You just did the colossus power move.
[234:04.64]I can't do that.
[234:08.88]Found him!
[234:10.36]Get him!
[234:13.89]Why do you have... Open the door!
[234:17.17]Alright, ready?
[234:20.65]3, 2, 1, go!
[234:21.17]Ow!
[234:27.35]Boss fight, he's gonna get over the crane.
[234:30.52]Alright, you go by the crane.
[234:40.34]It's getting steadily more ridiculous.
[234:43.33]Just the way that we're having to catch up.
[234:44.93]He pulls a ladder and we get the crane.
[234:47.71]Okay, I'm gonna drop it to him and he's dropping on top of me.
[234:51.25]He's like, knock me up.
[234:53.32]I'm trying.
[234:56.10]Oh, you had to stand on it, I see.
[234:58.88]Alright, get me over there.
[235:00.96]How am I going to get you up here?
[235:05.30]You just dumped me off the side of the building.
[235:08.10]I wish I could, but I can't.
[235:09.23]Oh, that would be so funny.
[235:10.15]What?
[235:10.37]Fire racks, huh?
[235:24.19]I'm going to use the crane to help knock him out.
[235:27.73]Cut him off.
[235:28.37]What?
[235:33.29]That's dangerous.
[235:34.85]That would have irreparably burned my hand.
[235:37.51]But that's okay.
[235:38.99]Start the crane.
[235:43.35]Oh, this is going to be bad.
[235:44.21]I see you up there.
[235:45.41]There you go.
[235:46.41]I started the crane.
[235:47.75]This is the beginning of a James Bond movie.
[235:49.87]Oh, God.
[235:50.53]Really?
[235:50.83]This is not good.
[235:51.59]Come on.
[235:53.22]This is Casino Royale.
[235:55.71]Is this what happened in Casino Royale?
[235:57.37]Like the very beginning, didn't they fight on a crane?
[236:00.53]Maybe they did.
[236:02.99]The best Bond movie of the new generation.
[236:07.36]Cut him off!
[236:11.90]He's coming right over to you, too.
[236:13.14]That's funny.
[236:14.94]He is.
[236:15.22]I'm cutting him off.
[236:15.98]I did what you told me to do.
[236:17.56]Nice work.
[236:20.03]Let's jump up there.
[236:22.17]This is not gonna end well for one of us.
[236:26.67]I'm coming.
[236:28.57]I'm coming, Vincent!
[236:31.31]He's gonna throw you off.
[236:32.85]Hang on!
[236:33.99]You're gonna get thrown off the edge.
[236:37.86]Oh, no.
[236:39.24]Oh, no.
[236:39.94]This is a lot.
[236:41.16]I'm sorry.
[236:41.74]I could not go faster than this.
[236:43.60]He's literally stepping on my fingers.
[236:45.28]I can just trapeze walk over there.
[236:50.09]I'm coming down.
[236:57.26]What?
[237:00.58]What's going on?
[237:01.28]Oh, wait.
[237:01.92]How did that happen?
[237:02.70]I had to push R2.
[237:04.42]I thought I had to push square.
[237:06.92]He was pushing you.
[237:07.93]You were pushing him.
[237:09.37]That hurt so bad.
[237:14.69]Oh, God.
[237:15.15]He gives me a Diablo 3 angle.
[237:16.87]What?
[237:22.75]This is so dumb.
[237:23.75]All right.
[237:25.01]We got to split up.
[237:25.93]I'll go this way.
[237:26.80]Yeah, we really have to, like, corral him.
[237:28.00]We have to corral him like a rabbit.
[237:29.19]What?
[237:30.09]Oh, tap.
[237:30.75]Got him.
[237:31.15]That dude should be, like, an Olympic runner.
[237:36.19]Three stooges.
[237:56.19]We're gonna hang him over the edge.
[237:57.25]We're even tying him up.
[237:59.95]So, you gonna tell me where Harvey is?
[238:03.65]Fuck you, I ain't telling you shit.
[238:05.81]Now it's gonna be go find a tool, but this time for torture.
[238:10.34]Oh, look at this!
[238:11.90]A gun!
[238:12.68]Whoa!
[238:14.25]Wow, that's cool.
[238:15.39]That was a that's cool, whoa.
[238:17.33]That was a magic trick.
[238:19.61]Whoa, where'd you get that?
[238:22.31]I pulled it out of nowhere.
[238:23.87]Cool, man.
[238:24.23]That's cool.
[238:25.51]What do you say?
[238:26.91]Guys, come on.
[238:28.02]I've got a few ideas.
[238:30.10]Yeah, me too.
[238:31.72]Let's see if you'll talk or not.
[238:33.20]Ooh, now it's like a different kind of toy box.
[238:35.86]It's like a torture toy box.
[238:41.58]I went right for it.
[238:43.08]I'm sorry.
[238:43.42]He's okay.
[238:43.70]Ah, we can open his wallet and we can take his credit cards and buy a bunch of shit.
[238:47.04]Look at this smart guy torture.
[239:13.33]Let me hold my teeth.
[239:15.97]Start talking.
[239:17.31]Please stop.
[239:19.82]And I got your wallet.
[239:20.64]You've already shot him in the leg.
[239:22.38]Yeah.
[239:23.38]Oh, look.
[239:23.97]What do we got here?
[239:24.97]Your car keys.
[239:25.71]Yeah, so?
[239:27.77]Considering you shot him in the you were not The very first thing you can do I'm pretty sure I know What do you have in your hand you'll see
[239:55.66]Is that a bee smoker?
[239:57.24]Come on.
[239:58.09]Start talking.
[239:59.51]I said start talking.
[240:00.79]Come on.
[240:01.49]I ain't saying shit.
[240:02.89]Fuck you.
[240:03.43]God damn it.
[240:04.95]Why did I use it?
[240:06.13]You try to use it.
[240:07.65]Oh, we got it.
[240:08.25]He's talking.
[240:09.21]I'll tell you what you want.
[240:12.32]What convinced you?
[240:12.98]Was it shooting you?
[240:14.20]Or was it throwing your precious car keys?
[240:15.88]That was over the line.
[240:22.18]It's got a big mansion there.
[240:24.04]It's the truth.
[240:25.02]I swear.
[240:25.84]So that's where the rat is hiding, huh?
[240:27.44]Yeah, that's where he is.
[240:29.58]Don't tell him I told you.
[240:30.82]Don't tell him I said that, though, please.
[240:33.92]He's bleeding from a vital kneecap.
[240:43.59]The funny thing is, he's dead up there.
[240:46.23]He's going to be up there for probably days.
[240:47.93]He's going to bleed out.
[240:49.72]He needs to eat and shit.
[240:50.76]He's dead in like three days.
[240:53.12]Guess we're heading down to Mexico then.
[240:55.32]Yeah.
[240:56.58]You can shoot me and throw away my car keys, but oh my god, you put smoke in my eyes?
[241:00.54]That's the line.
[241:03.12]What does it look like?
[241:04.52]Wait.
[241:05.38]Step aside.
[241:07.96]Whoa!
[241:09.80]That might be my favorite thing of the whole game so far.
[241:12.46]Hey, what do you think about this?
[241:13.86]Whoa, cool!
[241:17.10]There you go.
[241:18.10]I would clap if I could, but my arms are tied.
[241:19.74]There you go.
[241:26.37]I got a contact that might fly us down to Mexico.
[241:29.79]Hey, we're gonna get on the plane.
[241:31.79]You called it.
[241:33.37]That's good.
[241:34.97]And I got an idea on how to get those guns.
[241:37.65]Are we gonna need cash?
[241:39.56]Are we actually gonna get, like, a third-person shooter?
[241:42.66]End of the game.
[241:44.36]I mean, I feel like when a video game always has to up the ante, that's kind of what was always gonna happen.
[241:51.28]Mm-hmm.
[241:52.57]You know what I mean?
[241:53.52]Okay, you escape prison, sure.
[241:55.30]You go on like a boat river chase, all right?
[241:57.98]Up on the ante.
[241:58.68]A car chase with guns.
[242:00.30]All right, up the ante.
[242:01.42]Now you both have guns and you have to fight your... It seems like the natural climax.
[242:06.85]Unfortunately.
[242:07.83]Or fortunately.
[242:08.49]I mean, it could be fortunately.
[242:14.51]So for pretty varied locations so far at least.
[242:17.43]Yeah.
[242:17.91]That's at least good.
[242:18.77]Like what if we were just in prison the whole game though?
[242:20.87]Yeah.
[242:31.74]You ready?
[242:32.48]Yeah.
[242:32.80]What's with you and guns?
[242:33.50]Why don't you give me the gun?
[242:35.04]Exactly.
[242:35.80]Look, we need to keep a low profile.
[242:37.76]What do you mean?
[242:38.42]You just shot a guy.
[242:39.58]I say we do this the fast way, man.
[242:41.32]Just in and out.
[242:42.14]I say we do this the easy way.
[242:43.94]Let's not make a scene.
[242:44.64]Oh, God, another decision.
[242:47.06]Leo keeps the gun.
[242:47.92]Vincent takes the gun.
[242:50.10]What do you want to do here?
[242:51.11]You want to do another choice?
[242:52.49]I feel like everyone's going to pick Vincent takes the gun, so we may as well go against the grain for once.
[242:59.05]You know, you're probably right.
[243:00.15]Just make sure nobody gets hurt.
[243:04.06]Wait, I thought you were... I thought that means you got the gun.
[243:06.78]No.
[243:07.24]The calm way is I get the gun.
[243:10.32]Oh.
[243:10.40]The crazy way is in and out.
[243:12.55]Oh, okay.
[243:14.29]We're doing like a hands up.
[243:15.45]Steal that car.
[243:15.91]Get that car.
[243:17.75]You're going in there and literally robbing the place.
[243:19.89]Oh, okay.
[243:21.01]Oh.
[243:21.81]Alright, I can do that.
[243:27.02]Start robbery.
[243:31.04]Can you just go in?
[243:33.19]I have to wait for you.
[243:33.85]What if I don't want to start yet?
[243:34.77]Can you start a conversation?
[243:35.45]I'll distract her, though.
[243:36.11]Yeah, distract her.
[243:38.05]Get some info.
[243:38.71]Wow.
[243:38.85]Okay, rob it.
[243:43.03]Oh, well.
[243:43.31]Anybody else you can talk to in there?
[243:44.99]She's dead to me.
[243:46.49]Yeah, there's another guy.
[243:47.49]We got a guy in the back.
[243:48.25]Right?
[243:48.47]Case in the joint.
[243:59.75]And I think that's it.
[244:02.27]There is something else I can do over here.
[244:03.97]What's that?
[244:06.25]No cops.
[244:06.95]You sabotaged the telephone.
[244:08.09]All right.
[244:08.37]Good.
[244:08.61]Good.
[244:08.93]Nice work.
[244:09.49]Good thing we didn't go in right away.
[244:10.47]Hey, man.
[244:12.27]How are you doing?
[244:12.97]There's a fucking robbery.
[244:14.05]Hey, man.
[244:14.61]How are you doing?
[244:24.50]It's the key to the register.
[244:26.02]So fucking open it.
[244:27.26]You're wasting your time.
[244:28.48]There's barely any cash in the register.
[244:30.46]Check out the door.
[244:31.24]Look out.
[244:35.23]Open it.
[244:35.41]Told ya.
[244:36.81]Shit.
[244:38.79]What'd you say?
[244:39.33]Not one more word from you.
[244:40.75]Bullshit.
[244:41.29]Sit down.
[244:41.85]Sit down.
[244:42.47]Not one more word from you.
[244:44.73]All right, all right.
[244:45.77]No need to panic.
[244:46.63]We should check it out.
[244:47.61]Sorry, somebody ran?
[244:48.42]Nobody ran?
[244:51.92]Did they?
[244:53.78]Oh, there's a guy back here!
[244:56.76]Let me go!
[244:58.54]Leo, get over here!
[245:01.03]Put it down!
[245:03.35]Put him down!
[245:03.99]You're gonna use up all the bullets!
[245:06.25]I just got knocked out.
[245:17.69]I'm not real sure how.
[245:20.46]But we're back here.
[245:22.24]That was a very good checkpoint.
[245:24.10]That was a good checkpoint.
[245:25.12]Okay.
[245:26.66]You can't shoot me, buddy.
[245:27.74]Nobody ran, did they?
[245:28.98]No.
[245:29.40]All right.
[245:29.78]I said, what if I go in here now?
[245:32.14]Are you ready?
[245:33.87]Okay.
[245:34.05]You open the door.
[245:36.67]Can you not?
[245:37.61]I mean, I can, but I want to hold a gun and scare the guy.
[245:42.13]He wasn't scared last time when you shot six bullets.
[245:49.28]Holy shit, I broke that guy's neck with one punch.
[245:53.24]I broke that guy's neck in half.
[245:54.43]What do you mean she's loading the gun?
[245:55.81]What do you mean she's loading the gun?
[245:57.71]How am I supposed to stop her from loading the gun?
[246:01.21]Don't try anything funny, man.
[246:14.88]What's the point of me having the gun if I can't... You're not supposed to kill people.
[246:19.72]We're not murderers.
[246:20.38]Does she have another gun?
[246:21.06]Alright, there's this combination here somewhere.
[246:24.70]Get the code to the safe.
[246:25.68]Alright, you take care of this.
[246:27.26]I'll make sure they don't move.
[246:28.16]She's probably got the code.
[246:37.50]I love how they're just kind of like, Relax, dude.
[246:39.48]Stop shooting.
[246:40.14]They're not even scared.
[246:41.38]They're just annoyed.
[246:44.90]Oh, Leet.
[246:47.82]Leet.
[246:49.62]One, three, seven.
[246:51.58]Shouldn't I be doing that?
[246:52.42]Uh, yeah, you probably should be.
[246:56.35]It's okay.
[246:57.17]Under control.
[247:00.21]Did the guy actually get away?
[247:01.53]Yeah, that guy got away.
[247:02.51]Look, it was like 30 bucks in here.
[247:03.99]Alright, driver.
[247:11.98]Hustle, man.
[247:12.60]There you go.
[247:15.40]That's what I'm talking about.
[247:16.56]Where's our car?
[247:17.84]Over here.
[247:21.20]Leo, we gotta go.
[247:22.38]Get in the car.
[247:23.26]Come on, Leo.
[247:23.78]Alright.
[247:26.48]Punch it.
[247:32.84]Nice.
[247:36.38]Oh, no.
[247:38.06]The county fair with the goofy trucks was in town today.
[247:46.40]Why would he drive directly into that?
[247:47.54]He probably should have driven.
[247:48.52]Well, you have the gun, so... Probably not another driving segment.
[247:53.76]No.
[247:53.92]Yeah, no problem.
[247:55.44]Just make sure to bring the goods, okay?
[247:58.82]Yeah, I know where that is.
[248:00.84]Got it.
[248:02.04]All right, see you there.
[248:05.22]How great would it be if we could tandem ride that bike?
[248:07.28]Oh, I forgot about the bike.
[248:08.94]Oh, that's too bad.
[248:11.74]You're right.
[248:12.08]Well, we got basketball instead.
[248:13.24]Just try to murder, like, four people.
[248:34.86]Well, didn't really try to.
[248:36.98]We were just shooting the sky.
[248:37.74]I think we have to... I think we're meant to assume the guy you shot in the knee survived.
[248:43.39]Probably.
[248:44.19]Like he had to have.
[248:45.43]Even though...
[248:49.60]I mean, there was an actual crosshair there with left trigger, right trigger shooting mechanics.
[248:54.25]You have to assume they get that.
[248:54.97]You know how on GTA when you did like a gas station heist, you intimidate the people just by pointing at them?
[249:02.89]I thought that you just almost drove into that car.
[249:05.72]I was about to say that would be amazing.
[249:08.10]If you just crashed into that car.
[249:09.62]I've been through a lot.
[249:20.14]I'm Vincent.
[249:20.70]Oh, hello, Vincent.
[249:22.88]How nice to meet you.
[249:23.82]That was not an odd way to introduce yourself.
[249:26.19]You're a fucking idiot.
[249:27.05]Not like, hi, I'm Vincent, or how you doing?
[249:28.87]What?
[249:29.67]Why don't you bring your whole family next time?
[249:31.27]I'm Vincent.
[249:31.77]I'm out.
[249:33.37]Hey, what's wrong with you?
[249:35.87]What's wrong with me?
[249:37.43]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[249:39.26]You think I'm vending ice cream here?
[249:41.92]Listen, I told you I don't do business with strangers.
[249:46.26]And this guy, he looks like a stranger to me.
[249:50.32]Do you have a problem with me?
[249:52.52]No.
[249:53.22]Yeah, I got a problem with you.
[249:54.84]You have a problem with me?
[249:56.12]Well, who would you get my gun?
[249:57.94]Intervene, handle it.
[249:59.14]Uh-oh.
[250:00.86]We did it Leo's way last time.
[250:02.34]Yeah, let's do it your way.
[250:05.79]That was easy.
[250:06.35]Okay.
[250:09.79]Listen, I'm trained in 17 different ways to disassemble a fighter arm.
[250:13.95]And that's what he's doing.
[250:16.45]Here you go.
[250:21.02]I'll give you back the slide when you give me the guns.
[250:23.18]Who the hell is this guy?
[250:25.88]Navy SEAL.
[250:26.96]Let's just get those guns and we'll be out of here in no time.
[250:29.97]Okay?
[250:34.11]Okay, Jasmine.
[250:35.23]How much is there?
[250:35.69]One, two, three.
[250:37.93]Those are hundreds.
[250:39.49]So at least 800 bucks, maybe 1,000.
[250:41.45]If you account for inflation.
[250:43.89]I think this is a choose your weapon of the part of the game here.
[250:48.19]Oh, yeah.
[250:49.45]Oh, yeah.
[250:49.87]Mm-hmm.
[250:53.24]Choose and try the weapons.
[250:55.06]All right.
[250:55.40]We'll try the weapon.
[250:56.18]Well, you got to pick first.
[250:57.48]I guess I'll talk to her.
[250:59.13]How do you try?
[250:59.69]You want to make it easy.
[251:01.99]You don't tell me what to do.
[251:03.77]Don't you dare.
[251:07.99]Don't you dare.
[251:09.91]Listen, you're going to shave the hairs off my face.
[251:12.71]I don't know what your problem is.
[251:15.93]I don't like having guns pointed at my face.
[251:17.89]There's a Dark Souls role.
[251:22.39]Taking the tough guy attitude.
[251:27.83]No, I don't like it.
[251:28.47]I don't like the burst.
[251:30.71]Too bad.
[251:31.23]My turn.
[251:33.53]What is the top one?
[251:34.27]Looks like a carbine.
[251:35.61]Looks like a... I think I want the shotgun.
[251:43.42]Any good place for target practice around here?
[251:46.30]That one good hmm probably feels like what I imagined yours right carbine The carbine Yeah, you can say it either way guys
[252:12.68]That's the English way to say it.
[252:14.56]The American way, you know, carbine versus carbine, you know.
[252:19.70]Hey, chat.
[252:24.72]My chat, at least.
[252:26.10]Hang on, hold on, Jeremiah.
[252:26.70]I want them to hear something.
[252:27.75]Okay.
[252:29.59]Oh, what's that?
[252:30.73]Hang on, let me do it one more time.
[252:33.83]You missed that one.
[252:34.65]Wait, is that the pronunciation on the dictionary carbine saying the word carbine?
[252:40.57]I think it is.
[252:42.69]That's right.
[252:43.37]All right.
[252:46.33]Just making sure we're clear.
[252:48.55]Can you shoot one of these so we can check out your skills?
[252:54.40]Here it goes.
[252:57.50]Look in the air.
[253:01.54]Look up.
[253:01.82]You're supposed to shoot the glass out of the air, man.
[253:06.60]Listen, that is the official dictionary.com pronunciation, so take it up with them.
[253:11.55]Yeah, it's carbine versus carbine.
[253:13.13]I want you to email Merriam-Webster, okay?
[253:15.85]With your displeasure.
[253:17.45]But that's an English... Merriam-Webster.
[253:20.39]That's not an English guy?
[253:22.02]Where do you think we speak English from?
[253:24.66]Yeah, because he wrote the book.
[253:26.10]Merriam-Webster's book of English.
[253:27.78]He wrote that book, and that's where English came from.
[253:30.08]All right, you ready?
[253:34.72]What are you going, with the shotgun?
[253:35.80]I'm going with the shotgun.
[253:37.36]All right, I'll go for the carbine.
[253:40.24]Just so I can say it more.
[253:41.58]Because I have a voice.
[253:44.60]Unlike you people typing.
[253:45.66]You ready to leave?
[253:48.80]We paid her, right?
[253:53.60]Throw a bottle at italics.
[253:58.05]I wish.
[254:00.15]I've never been so offended in my entire life.
[254:10.79]Reload the carbine.
[254:15.63]The origin of English, all from one man and one book.
[254:18.83]He wrote all those words down.
[254:21.51]So he was looking at, for instance, like a pie.
[254:24.69]And he's like, I'm at P now.
[254:26.24]What should this be?
[254:28.78]Let's just start naming things with the letter P. So everything that he looked at when he got to a certain part of the alphabet there, like if we started with A, B, C, it's an alphabetical order.
[254:37.24]He got to P, started naming things pie and pizza, party.
[254:41.09]It's not that hard.
[254:43.54]Hey, are you guys, uh, when you join the military, are you planning on joining the, uh, Marine Corps?
[254:49.71]Or the Marine Corps?
[254:53.73]Oh, man.
[254:55.33]He's got you there.
[254:57.76]Oh, man, he's got you there.
[254:59.22]That's, uh, I think that's checkmate.
[255:00.88]Hey, it's me.
[255:02.08]I got some information about Leo.
[255:04.34]Okay, you know where he is?
[255:06.20]I just met him.
[255:07.24]Give me his location.
[255:08.06]Sure, but it's gonna cost me.
[255:10.38]Don't worry about that.
[255:11.35]Just tell me where he is.
[255:14.04]Harvey.
[255:16.98]So I'm gonna need a sample of everyone's urine.
[255:22.03]Also, make sure you're not doing any drugs.
[255:24.79]Yeah, but wouldn't that mean it was carbon?
[255:26.39]Urine.
[255:26.57]Carbon.
[255:26.89]Still not on.
[255:28.31]Urine.
[255:28.45]Urine.
[255:49.65]It's the snitch.
[255:53.81]Who's this?
[255:54.25]This is your friend, right?
[255:57.81]Uh, but those are both us.
[255:59.02]It's you and then me.
[256:00.08]No, I'm talking about this lady.
[256:01.72]Oh, yeah, that's my baby.
[256:04.28]Or I hope it's my baby.
[256:05.40]Maybe he doesn't know about the baby.
[256:06.76]What if it's my baby?
[256:08.48]Oh, wow.
[256:09.02]And that's the twist.
[256:10.21]I don't know, but there's a baby, and it seems like it's coming right now.
[256:15.03]What if there was a delivery, deliver the baby scene?
[256:17.61]No, I've seen this scene in Prometheus.
[256:18.95]There's gonna be an alien in there.
[256:21.05]Uh-oh.
[256:21.41]The cops are gonna come when we arrive.
[256:23.61]Probably.
[256:35.42]I'm gonna have to deliver the baby.
[256:37.16]I would love some sardines.
[256:40.22]That delicious fish.
[256:41.84]Sardines.
[256:42.28]Sardines.
[256:42.78]See, look, there's so many examples.
[256:44.86]Sardines.
[256:49.55]Come on.
[256:50.13]Hey, can you stop by that phone booth over there?
[256:51.85]I really don't want to have to take a letter grade off of this because we got one car game.
[256:55.23]Two car scenes?
[256:56.01]I sure hope so.
[256:56.57]Better be a third one.
[256:57.21]Yeah, me too, man.
[256:58.07]I mean, the one car scene was like... I feel like more of that is kind of overstaying its welcome.
[257:04.40]Yeah, that's true.
[257:06.16]Like, do you want to shoot more infinite police?
[257:09.30]No, no, but no.
[257:11.44]You know what I'm saying?
[257:12.16]Yeah.
[257:12.36]Like, it was there for the right amount of time, and then it's gone.
[257:15.68]There's your phone.
[257:17.34]Yep.
[257:18.60]What's my job?
[257:20.31]Make sure to get us that.
[257:21.05]I think I'm supposed to call the missus, and she's going to be, like, in the midst of labor.
[257:25.23]Do you get to play with all the games and have fun?
[257:27.17]Okay.
[257:28.51]And I'll be over here.
[257:31.98]Can I go in?
[257:32.77]I still don't have any change for the- Oh, never mind.
[257:35.09]Find me some money.
[257:35.87]Look on the ground.
[257:36.47]I saw a newsstand on the other side of the square.
[257:38.21]Can I steal from this guy?
[257:39.59]Maybe I could get some change.
[257:40.57]Probably can.
[257:40.87]Yeah, you can.
[257:41.25]There's coins in this guy's house.
[257:42.21]Jesus, man.
[257:43.35]You're a mess.
[257:44.91]What do you want, man?
[257:46.06]Come over here.
[257:46.66]I'm just cracking this guy.
[257:47.56]Oh, there's a newspaper stand.
[257:52.46]Hold on.
[257:53.06]We'll come back to that guy.
[257:55.36]Anything I can do for you?
[257:57.06]Wait, man.
[257:57.54]Are you deaf or something?
[257:58.91]Just leave me the fuck alone so I can sleep.
[258:02.88]No, I'm not gonna be that guy.
[258:03.73]I'm gonna be the wingman.
[258:05.57]So what are you waiting for?
[258:07.27]Get lost.
[258:07.91]He's the guy from the junkyard again.
[258:10.85]No, I'm staying out of this.
[258:12.63]Take care of her, okay?
[258:14.61]Shit.
[258:15.85]Shit.
[258:17.37]He's gonna be like, is he wrong?
[258:18.97]Are you to blame for everything?
[258:20.55]Nah, we're not going there, man.
[258:22.06]I saved you.
[258:23.00]Uh, we got a lady with a crowbar.
[258:24.68]Well, hello there, handsome.
[258:27.72]You're talking to a married man.
[258:29.36]Just my luck.
[258:31.53]oh what's she doing help with that no thanks I'm fine you sure because I know some tricks look I got this all right okay what do you recommend all right just trying to be helpful good luck thanks notch girly magazines oh yes oh arms of service cigarettes are you about to break terms of service on your stream because you're playing as that guy where did I get that dollar
[258:58.53]Yeah, remember like I might be streaming.
[259:00.99]We're both streaming the same thing, but he it's... I think I just got changed from buying some cigs, so there's multiple ways to get the money.
[259:12.16]One is probably definitely stealing from that guy.
[259:16.18]Whoa.
[259:16.34]How's that for a magic trick?
[259:19.22]Did you just bump your head on that and turned on?
[259:20.94]No, I kicked it.
[259:22.02]Alright, you got your change?
[259:23.81]Yeah.
[259:24.01]I just did that.
[259:27.68]At least the bell worked.
[259:29.44]Oh, did you?
[259:29.98]Yeah.
[259:30.49]Let's see if I can do something with this guy.
[259:33.85]Hey, what do you charge for a pack of smokes here?
[259:35.57]This girl's definitely doing something back here.
[259:37.61]Yeah, I just tried to talk to her and she's like, leave me alone.
[259:39.83]It's a nice night, right?
[259:42.99]36 cents for a lousy pack of smokes?
[259:45.25]Are you serious?
[259:46.65]Yeah.
[259:47.78]Okay.
[259:48.04]Price has been 36 cents for the past two years.
[259:51.78]Where have you been?
[259:53.04]Been around.
[259:54.04]Just haven't been buying any cigarettes, that's all.
[259:57.86]Ring ring.
[259:59.56]Mother effer.
[260:01.60]Oh, mother effer.
[260:04.24]Look, I tried to offer my best burglar tips and she didn't want to take them.
[260:13.11]That's definitely like a secret back there, by the way.
[260:15.59]It's probably something to do, but just go turn into Superman.
[260:19.76]Go Superman it up.
[260:20.60]Don't you want to see what's inside the next secret door?
[260:24.54]I mean, what if we could... That she's breaking into?
[260:26.80]I feel like you had an opportunity to, like, help her out or something.
[260:29.38]Because didn't she like you when you walked up to her?
[260:31.16]I don't know.
[260:31.42]She didn't... I'm too old.
[260:32.18]She hated me.
[260:33.22]I'm older than you.
[260:33.86]Didn't you... Didn't she have an... You have an option to say, I like your passion, and then you pick the wrong one.
[260:37.98]I'm pretty sure.
[260:38.60]But... But... This... Alright, you talk.
[260:40.78]I'll do it again.
[260:44.24]Just go open up that telephone clock and see what's in there.
[260:46.41]Look, I'm in here, okay?
[260:48.77]This is not Superman.
[260:49.77]That's an outdated reference.
[260:50.95]We're Deadpool now.
[260:51.89]Two hats at the same time.
[260:55.93]Alright, let's see if I can get it out.
[260:58.24]No, I blew it.
[260:59.80]Well, just wait.
[261:00.76]No, I blew it.
[261:01.80]You blew it.
[261:02.30]I blew my opportunity.
[261:03.66]I'm just gonna come make funny faces at you while you're on the phone.
[261:10.64]I'm getting us a plane, man.
[261:12.19]So we can escape.
[261:13.23]I'm gonna use this pack of cigs later, too.
[261:22.25]Sorry, you don't exist in my game.
[261:23.49]How come I don't exist in your game?
[261:25.56]so that I can take it seriously.
[261:27.88]Why?
[261:28.38]What?
[261:28.60]He's telling me about my baby.
[261:32.26]Okay.
[261:34.10]Okay, okay.
[261:35.00]This is important.
[261:36.46]Oh, it just... Star Wars washed me off the screen.
[261:38.72]I didn't even notice.
[261:40.54]That's pretty cool, actually.
[261:41.26]You're gonna be waiting right there.
[261:43.97]Hey.
[261:45.33]Did you get us a plane?
[261:46.55]Yeah.
[261:47.57]Yeah, I did.
[261:48.65]But I need to go.
[261:50.09]What?
[261:50.41]What are you talking about?
[261:51.15]Are you okay?
[261:51.89]I'm fine.
[261:52.87]But I need to be somewhere else right now.
[261:55.96]Hey, you can't just walk away.
[261:57.16]There's a guy up on the second floor.
[261:58.98]But something happened and I need to be there.
[262:01.12]Alright?
[262:02.90]Vincent.
[262:03.90]You can talk to me.
[262:05.68]We've come too far to back down now.
[262:07.96]Yeah.
[262:08.18]You need to talk to me.
[262:09.51]Tell me what's going on in your head.
[262:11.35]I was a writer on this game.
[262:12.85]Talk to me.
[262:15.33]And here comes the shootout.
[262:21.09]Bad guys are sneaking up.
[262:25.13]Uh, that looks like an assassin.
[262:26.63]You know, one assassin bad guy.
[262:28.07]That's like a real thin, yeah, assassin.
[262:30.91]He's got the silencer.
[262:35.31]Okay.
[262:35.53]He gets shot here.
[262:36.21]Mir, you- Fine.
[262:39.54]It's my wife.
[262:41.20]She's- Holy shit!
[262:43.72]How did you- How did you miss?
[262:44.70]No, it's Jack Nicholson.
[262:46.48]Oh my god.
[262:49.14]Silence or less accuracy, man.
[262:51.08]Less accuracy?
[262:51.78]You have all the time to just walk up and shoot me.
[262:56.44]He's got a lot of extra mags.
[263:00.51]He gets his own screen?
[263:02.81]Okay, that's pretty fucking cool.
[263:04.45]He gets his... We're playing triple call.
[263:07.23]It's okay, I don't trust him to be able to hit us anyway.
[263:10.77]That's actually kind of scary.
[263:11.95]I like it.
[263:12.83]He gets his... This is somebody invaded us.
[263:19.42]Didn't the door open the other way?
[263:21.00]Shit, his gear is way better than ours, too.
[263:23.48]I have a shitty dagger.
[263:24.74]The vent.
[263:25.56]I see it.
[263:28.55]The vent.
[263:30.05]Vincent, get up there and I'll push this across.
[263:35.55]Working like a well-oiled machine.
[263:36.99]He's gonna get in.
[263:38.01]There he goes.
[263:40.21]He seems kinda weak.
[263:41.67]Oh, he's shooting it now.
[263:42.96]What?
[263:44.42]That was a waste of bullets.
[263:48.99]You can make it.
[263:52.99]I love his screen.
[263:53.75]I just want to watch it.
[263:59.37]Get over here.
[264:00.19]I'll help you up.
[264:02.52]He's still not... He's very determined.
[264:05.72]You wouldn't think you would try a different way.
[264:07.04]He's about to break the fire axe.
[264:08.08]He's about to pull Jack Nicholson.
[264:09.68]You wouldn't try a different way at this point.
[264:15.75]Hold on, I wanna see it.
[264:16.49]Let's see how it happens.
[264:17.09]I kinda wanna see what's gonna happen.
[264:18.71]God damn it, I can't get it open!
[264:19.97]He's not gonna get it easy.
[264:24.65]They have to give you a lot of time, because there are probably real dumb people that can't figure out how to push the canoe over to the other side.
[264:30.42]I guarantee it.
[264:32.38]They did play testing, and like the people that were in charge of playing got caught by him, so they had to extend his animations.
[264:37.88]He's like, it didn't even work.
[264:40.80]What?
[264:48.27]I like how you're the one that's dead and not me.
[264:50.59]I love how we could aim from all the way back there too.
[264:53.49]Yeah, but not when he had like all the time in the world to do it.
[264:59.36]Like that's when he turned on his serious face.
[265:01.24]He was ready.
[265:03.58]I only got five bullets.
[265:05.74]I guess I actually have to kill him.
[265:09.66]Oops.
[265:09.98]No, what are you doing?
[265:10.86]I really didn't think I could fall from there.
[265:12.14]Now he actually is going to get here in time.
[265:14.27]Nah, he doesn't even have the fire axe yet.
[265:17.07]Okay.
[265:23.93]Go on.
[265:25.01]Like, this is the best assassin that they could afford.
[265:27.67]Yeah.
[265:28.31]This guy, they got this guy at Walmart.
[265:32.24]They pulled this guy aside at Walmart and were like, hey, buddy, you want to make, like, 200 bucks?
[265:36.56]Jump on the crates unless you want to see him do the exact same.
[265:42.59]They found this guy on the bus.
[265:45.71]Got him on Craigslist.
[265:52.03]Bust assassin.
[265:52.77]Better hurry though.
[265:53.39]He's like almost at the end of that.
[265:54.61]No, he's not.
[265:55.75]Yeah, he is.
[265:58.17]No, but he got to the end of that one because we got to the end of ours.
[266:05.13]Turned into a horror game.
[266:08.71]There he is.
[266:13.04]Okay, cool.
[266:13.72]So, wait.
[266:18.12]Push.
[266:18.64]Oh, I thought we were going to drop it on him.
[266:22.87]Okay, we have some thin sheets of metal to protect us.
[266:25.81]I can't wait till we drop the stage light on his head.
[266:29.31]That's absolutely what's gonna happen.
[266:31.97]Because there's a stage back there.
[266:33.35]Like, there's all the seats.
[266:34.57]Yeah.
[266:35.08]Directly ahead.
[266:35.64]You're setting up a funny stage light head drop.
[266:38.90]Yeah, you absolutely are.
[266:42.28]Where is it?
[266:43.54]Oh, no, no.
[266:43.88]Okay.
[266:44.02]Oh, you have to do cover.
[266:46.12]Oh, God.
[266:47.32]Okay.
[266:47.70]I'm going.
[266:48.30]Oh!
[266:48.46]Careful.
[266:51.49]Careful.
[266:56.87]I'm gonna do the same thing for you.
[267:03.14]Let's go ambush.
[267:08.84]I guess so.
[267:09.42]How do you... I think you... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[267:11.70]You can come over here.
[267:14.50]I'm coming.
[267:15.76]Hold on, man.
[267:16.62]Nice.
[267:17.06]Get the gun.
[267:33.37]This head just comes off you pop it off like a daisy.
[267:44.80]I thought you were naked.
[267:46.74]I Don't know why I don't know why dude.
[267:48.14]I thought you were just naked.

[268:34.75]You don't seem too happy.
[268:35.67]Thanks.
[268:39.93]MLC stealth interrupting my cutscene.
[268:41.27]Trust me, I'm happy.
[268:42.47]Wait, is he talking to you?
[268:44.17]No, he just like came on line.
[268:45.22]It's really complicated between me and my wife.
[268:48.38]He's about to get some friend requests out of nowhere.
[268:51.24]Yeah.
[268:51.48]Time to get on the plane.
[268:52.70]Oh, now I have to play basketball with your son.
[269:16.90]My son is a newborn child.
[269:20.34]You're gonna have to bring some flowers or something.
[269:23.53]You're gonna have to bring a cute little onesie with a little bonnet.
[269:34.61]I'd bring him out there anyways.
[269:36.72]Just slam Duncan in front of him.
[269:39.32]He's like, yeah, what the fuck do you got?
[269:40.98]And he's in a bonnet.
[269:42.06]He's sitting in a little bassinet on the court.
[269:46.76]I could tell it was your first kid.
[269:48.76]You could.
[269:50.48]Yeah.
[269:51.85]Back at the hospital, the way you were holding your baby and shit.
[269:56.43]I guess you have two kids, so maybe I can play basketball.
[269:58.55]I'm sorry about the shit part.
[270:00.61]I didn't mean it in a bad way, you know.
[270:02.63]But, yeah.
[270:04.68]Anyway, it's a great thing watching your kid grow up.
[270:07.66]So do we take over from here now?
[270:09.38]I can imagine it is.
[270:10.79]I don't know, maybe.
[270:11.67]Because we were getting on a plane.
[270:13.61]Why would they do a flash forward to the plane and then get us on the plane, right?
[270:16.97]I feel like there's at least one more scene because you had a whole scene with your family.
[270:22.45]My guy hasn't met his wife yet.
[270:24.15]In the video game.
[270:24.81]This has to be... From here forward would be good.
[270:27.22]I don't think so.
[270:27.74]There's got to be one more.
[270:30.02]You think so?
[270:30.54]Mm-hmm.
[270:39.39]And when it finally happened, that day when we found out, we've never been so happy.
[270:50.08]Then everything went to hell.
[270:54.80]And I ended up in prison.
[270:55.56]This game was about prison.
[270:56.98]I do.
[271:00.50]Like the first third of it was about prison.
[271:02.92]The second third of it was about running away from prison.
[271:05.58]Yeah.
[271:06.04]And we're almost in the final third.
[271:11.76]A silver EXP thanks to the $30 total here.
[271:14.56]He says, hey, Jerma, fuck you.
[271:16.50]Hey, Jerma, fuck you.
[271:17.29]I thought you loved me.
[271:19.87]Well, thank you, first of all, for the $30.
[271:22.75]Back to back here, $15.
[271:23.35]About the birth of my firstborn.
[271:25.15]You think they're going to skip over that?
[271:26.39]I don't know why you're mad at me.
[271:27.81]They're going to bust in there and then send another assassin.
[271:30.43]Thank you so much, dude.
[271:31.54]And this time, they're going to kill, like, a family member.
[271:36.30]The receptionist should know where to go.
[271:40.42]Well, we're in the hospital.
[271:41.70]Plus, you know you want to be in like the Hitman hospital sequence.
[271:44.01]Hey, Benson, I found the maternity ward.
[271:45.73]We need to take the elevator.
[271:47.71]Oh, which way do I go?
[271:49.61]Thinking face?
[271:50.19]All right, hold on.
[271:51.31]Is The Last Jedi the best Star Wars movie?
[271:54.09]I don't think thinking face.
[271:55.29]Not sure.
[271:58.47]There's none of you think about that.
[272:03.02]Hold on.
[272:03.48]If humans, humans are 70%.
[272:05.24]Oh, what the fuck?
[272:07.66]You're in the hospital.
[272:09.84]I am?
[272:13.81]Uh, ma'am, can we admit this man to the hospital?
[272:15.63]Hmm, thinking face?
[272:17.53]I'm not sure.
[272:18.57]Hey look, it's me.
[272:41.19]It's us.
[272:41.49]Hey look, it's us.
[272:43.27]Hey, we'd like to turn ourselves into the hot- I put like a Bible on it.
[272:47.21]Ah, we shouldn't be looking at that.
[272:50.09]Nah, just looking around.
[272:52.13]Alright.
[272:54.99]You wanna come play Connect Four?
[272:56.77]Sure.
[273:01.87]We have to play the song though.
[273:04.65]What's- is there a Connect Four song?
[273:05.95]Of course there is.
[273:08.95]What's the Connect Four song?
[273:10.54]Go for the bottom.
[273:11.90]Go for the top.
[273:13.08]Oh, yeah.
[273:14.16]Go for it.
[273:14.70]The commercial.
[273:19.80]Just make your move, Einstein.
[273:21.40]Hey, just make your move, Einstein.
[273:25.66]All right, let's go.
[273:26.78]He knows you're going slow.
[273:27.92]Come on.
[273:36.70]You took way longer than I did.
[273:37.94]Wow.
[273:38.22]Idiot.
[273:38.59]Really?
[273:39.23]It needed to be to the song.
[273:41.07]It had to be to the song.
[273:42.39]Don't you understand?
[273:43.63]Now let's play for real.
[274:06.59]That's a bit strategy.
[274:08.47]Alright, while we play Connect 4, I gotta thank somebody.
[274:11.23]Uh, somebody just gave a hundred fucking dollars.
[274:13.61]AceMcLace, thank you for the hundred dollars, ten thousand bits, dude.
[274:17.91]That's a lot.
[274:20.31]How much money have you given me now?
[274:23.49]Like, three hundred fucking dollars in the last, like, week?
[274:28.40]That's a lot, man.
[274:31.02]I'm not going to fall into his bullshit here.
[274:35.86]It's like we're doing the exact same strategy, actually.
[274:40.27]Hey, German, just wanted to let you know that my last donation was sent when you and Italics were deciding between the horses and the couple.
[274:46.17]I asked you to kill Italics and eat the couple.
[274:49.25]And I sent... Hold on.
[274:50.23]I'll fuck this up.
[274:53.55]Uh... And I sent one to Italics asking him to kill you and eat the horses.
[274:57.77]Love the stream.
[274:58.27]Thanks for brightening my day, nerds.
[275:00.90]Thank you, dude.
[275:04.26]There's a lot of money to give one person.
[275:08.00]Thank you.
[275:09.08]Make your move.
[275:09.66]Don't be so slow.
[275:10.54]You having trouble?
[275:15.98]Just calm down.
[275:17.26]I mean, I know what you're doing here.
[275:18.62]You don't know what I'm doing.
[275:20.54]You're trying to fuck with me.
[275:23.03]I don't know what I'm doing.
[275:24.67]Nobody fucks with me, okay?
[275:37.95]I'm gonna tell you.
[275:40.45]Nobody fucks with me.
[275:41.77]It would take a severe misclick.
[275:53.47]fill this whole board.
[275:55.11]We are gonna fill the whole board.
[275:56.19]It's like playing tic-tac-toe.
[276:10.07]Oh, you got it.
[276:10.99]You win.
[276:12.63]You didn't even see it.
[276:14.07]You didn't even see it, too.
[276:15.71]That's the funniest part.
[276:16.69]What are you talking about?
[276:17.29]I didn't see it.
[276:19.00]What do you think?
[276:19.40]He doesn't know!
[276:20.36]It's right here!
[276:21.48]Yeah, you had to look for it!
[276:22.93]Go for the bottom!
[276:23.99]Go for the top!
[276:24.51]You had to look for it!
[276:25.97]Go for it!
[276:28.75]Cut it!
[276:34.19]That hurt.
[276:36.71]Oh, that fucking hurt my throat.
[276:38.76]Why did that hurt my throat?
[276:51.07]If I hadn't said anything, you would have put it in a completely different spot.
[276:53.33]I saw it!
[276:53.69]I saw it.
[276:53.97]I saw that.
[276:54.55]You would have put it in a completely different spot.
[276:56.71]I'm so out of shape.
[276:57.65]I can't even see.
[276:58.31]I can't even yell right now.
[277:00.63]My diaphragm was, like, contracted.
[277:05.26]Connect my crane.
[277:12.68]Beat connect four.
[277:15.74]Oh, God.
[277:17.56]Oh, my God.
[277:18.02]Oh, shit.
[277:18.44]I think he's going to win.
[277:27.60]Dude, all you gotta do is... What?
[277:33.30]No way!
[277:33.96]Five in a row?
[277:35.02]I got five in a row.
[277:36.34]That means you get... This is embarrassing for you.
[277:39.60]Dude, you get the thing that turns all the other gems into the same gem and it blows them all up like Candy Crush.
[277:46.11]Alright, this is the last one for real.
[277:48.25]Last one.
[277:51.29]Yeah, for real.
[278:10.18]Not that easy, buddy.
[278:15.40]You sure?
[278:16.65]Mm-hmm.
[278:23.29]You think I'm fucking stupid?
[278:27.43]What, you think I'm some kind of fucking dummy?
[278:29.05]Let me see how I can make this play work here.
[278:40.87]When do we get to play Liar's Dice or something?
[278:58.30]Let me see.
[278:58.95]Let me see here.
[278:59.95]Hold on just a second.
[279:01.97]I see what you're doing.
[279:02.71]I ain't gonna let you fool... I ain't gonna let you fool me.
[279:09.13]Clock's ticking.
[279:11.06]Mm-hmm.
[279:12.70]Mm-hmm.
[279:25.67]I see what you're trying to do with this.
[279:27.15]Hmm.
[279:40.17]Do you, though?
[279:42.29]No, I do.
[279:44.73]I do.
[279:45.75]Oh, I do.
[279:46.67]I do.
[279:48.03]I do.
[279:48.51]Don't- I don't think so.
[279:49.91]Not right now.
[279:50.47]Mm-mm.
[279:53.98]That's not checkmate.
[279:55.12]Give me the fire axe.
[280:06.98]No, one of those was a joke.
[280:08.12]I gave you 5-4.
[280:10.58]I gave you Connect 5 as a joke.
[280:12.02]That was a tie game.
[280:17.20]I wanted to make my shitty Candy Crush iPad joke.
[280:20.32]That wasn't even a good joke.
[280:22.02]Get in the elevator.
[280:25.56]And why are you telling me this?
[280:27.22]Because nobody believes me.
[280:28.72]I want to get my money's worth.
[280:33.69]I want to get my money's worth, he says.
[280:38.50]I'm like, I'm like the ones who are laying it for free.
[280:41.32]What does he have to say?
[280:42.40]Yeah, how's this free ride taste?
[280:44.69]Hey, I'm trying to, I'm trying to see.
[280:48.57]I want to get, I want to get into, I want to get into like a talent stream.
[280:50.83]Right, right.
[280:51.35]Let me get in there.
[280:51.93]Maybe you should start believing it too.
[280:54.77]You're just like all the rest.
[280:57.19]Just leave me alone.
[281:00.33]Hold on.
[281:00.81]Hold on.
[281:01.43]Okay.
[281:01.67]We're getting the elevator in a second.
[281:03.15]Sometimes.
[281:06.39]I'm playing.
[281:08.55]Play by myself.
[281:10.43]Oh, I thought I could just win.
[281:13.35]Why would you be able to play by yourself, though?
[281:15.57]Hey, it's another piano.
[281:17.49]Oh, you can't play this one.
[281:18.60]No, you can't play that one?
[281:19.36]I want to see what's wrong with little Alex.
[281:24.56]It's your son.
[281:25.10]Your son's in here.
[281:26.12]Does he have an alligator shirt?
[281:28.48]No, but he does have a character that looks like a chipmunk version of Scooby-Doo.
[281:33.36]I'll give it one second.
[281:39.15]SilveryXP for $60 said, I'm sorry, BibleThump, I got banned.
[281:42.05]Well, what are you getting banned for?
[281:43.91]What did you do?
[281:44.69]Thank you for the $60.
[281:45.41]Martin, you need to behave!
[281:46.51]Will you not be behaving yourself?
[281:47.71]Is that what I understand?
[282:12.09]Thank you so much, though, dude.
[282:19.20]It is a brain of an ant.
[282:21.22]Oh, it was Nightbot.
[282:22.96]Oh.
[282:24.38]Well, sorry about that.
[282:25.78]Sorry that Nightbot put you in the crosshairs.
[282:28.75]But thank you so much for the 60 fucking dollars.
[282:30.77]Total, actually, more than that.
[282:32.89]This is 90 bucks here.
[282:37.41]Thanks, man.
[282:38.11]That's a lot of fucking money.
[282:40.47]Thank you.
[282:42.04]Alright, you ready to go in?
[282:44.80]Are you ready to go in?
[282:45.64]I am ready.
[282:46.74]Okay.
[282:47.75]Let's go get some morphine.
[282:51.35]Took you this long to ask us a question?
[282:53.43]We just played four matches of Connect Four.
[282:55.95]Alright, you know what to do.
[282:59.01]I have an eye on you since you did that shitty rendition of the TV commercial.
[283:03.62]You sounded like a seagull being stepped on.
[283:05.22]You guys seem familiar.
[283:06.40]Have I seen you before?
[283:07.66]Please let us confess.
[283:08.40]Nah, I don't think so.
[283:09.46]Hmm.
[283:10.76]Okay.
[283:12.22]Whatever.
[283:12.62]We're like school children.
[283:21.18]But your faces are so familiar.
[283:23.75]I'm sure I've seen you somewhere.
[283:29.88]I mean, like, how many times have we done that one, though?
[283:32.52]You know what I mean?
[283:32.98]Like, it's just gonna be, you choke him.
[283:34.58]You wanna talk the way out?
[283:35.82]I don't know.
[283:36.22]Let's talk our way out.
[283:37.28]Fine.
[283:38.02]That's a good idea.
[283:38.99]Talk your way out.
[283:39.41]It's probably me.
[283:40.53]It is?
[283:41.33]Yeah, I'm here a lot.
[283:42.71]I... Got this decease.
[283:45.97]The doctor's kit.
[283:46.79]Decease.
[283:48.13]Figured out what it is, but... You don't have to worry about it.
[283:51.60]It's very contagious.
[283:52.96]They don't think it's contagious.
[283:54.22]It's fine.
[283:55.34]Alright, well, this is my floor, so feel better.
[283:58.42]Alright, take it easy.
[284:03.83]Just contaminated the elevator buttons.
[284:06.37]Now here's the real sad part.
[284:07.69]What if he actually is sick and he doesn't know it and he just got us all sick?
[284:11.29]He just fucked up that guy's whole day.
[284:12.99]Carol?
[284:13.13]Carol?
[284:13.27]No.
[284:13.35]Is this person smoking?
[284:14.27]Damn.
[284:31.87]Wait, can we ride around?
[284:32.81]Hold on.
[284:41.32]I want to do that.
[284:42.42]That looks like a lot of fun.
[284:44.92]Jesus Christ.
[284:45.94]How do you balance?
[284:50.30]I don't understand.
[284:51.84]You just have to left and right.
[285:12.15]Alright, you're winning, I think.
[285:14.31]There we go.
[285:18.50]Maybe, I don't know.
[285:22.78]I was gonna say when I get to 100, I was gonna stop.
[285:29.86]Or at least 50, right?
[285:31.96]Well, it looks like it's getting a little bit harder.
[285:34.74]Whoa!
[285:35.98]Wow, it's hard.
[285:42.71]I gotta get to 50.
[285:43.41]Have to.
[285:49.06]OH GOD DAMMIT!
[285:51.00]I'm actually upset about this.
[285:52.50]I have to do it again.
[285:53.72]Oh no.
[285:55.94]Oh no.
[285:56.38]What was your number?
[285:57.62]49.
[285:58.50]What's mine?
[285:59.60]50.
[286:00.94]Aw yeah!
[286:01.46]Fuck, I got too cocky.
[286:05.23]Whatever, I'll take it.
[286:06.11]A win by four points is good enough.
[286:07.41]I gotta get 50.
[286:07.77]I have to get 50.
[286:08.41]Have to.
[286:09.29]I can't play anymore of this game.
[286:10.63]Just go talk to Carol.
[286:12.37]After you 50 you long just just go deliver your fucking baby.
[286:15.49]I'll be here for a few minutes So what's happening here The bulbs blown out.
[286:23.99]It's the third time this week Probably wiring nobody maintenance.
[286:28.86]No light bulb.
[286:31.60]I Think it's a ghost Don't listen I'm sold on this ghost
[286:40.19]You serious?
[286:41.47]You really think it's a ghost?
[286:43.53]Well, think about it.
[286:46.13]People die in here every single day.
[286:48.25]There has to be at least one ghost floating around in here.
[286:49.97]Do you give up?
[286:50.45]Yeah, I like, I just don't, I can't.
[286:52.71]Every time it gets to like 45, I panic.
[286:54.07]So why is this ghost breaking bulbs?
[286:56.73]Because he's trying to tell us something.
[286:59.73]I'm serious.
[287:01.43]Maybe it's trying to tell you that you have bad wiring.
[287:05.52]Huh.
[287:06.66]Maybe.
[287:07.78]Listen, here.
[287:10.79]Listen, bud.
[287:13.25]Oh, I yelled at you?
[287:14.41]Yeah.
[287:16.19]You said, Vincent!
[287:17.91]If anybody reminded, uh... Who saw the Lucius 2 video?
[287:23.97]What?
[287:24.48]Oh, wait, what?
[287:25.84]Lucius?
[287:26.58]The game, Lucius?
[287:28.28]Yeah, the horror game, Lucius 2.
[287:30.50]This is the... I'm getting huge flashbacks of playing Lucius 2.
[287:36.00]It's like the same hospital layout.
[287:42.61]Don't I have a pack of smokes that I bought from a convenience store?
[287:46.29]I think so.
[287:46.85]You edit again.
[287:47.73]Yes.
[287:47.87]My baby can wait, okay?
[287:48.71]Listen, my baby took like nine months to get out here.
[288:11.85]We can wait a little longer.
[288:23.44]Plus, I got time.
[288:24.14]What the fuck?
[288:24.70]I just cheated.
[288:25.98]The game just cheated.
[288:27.96]Even if I did, I wouldn't give you any.
[288:30.48]Come on, man.
[288:32.80]Uh... You need a doctor.
[288:36.94]Yeah.
[288:38.00]That's a great idea.
[288:39.62]Doctors have a lot of stuff I can get high on.
[288:42.36]Oh my god, this is really good.
[288:44.65]I should sweet talk one of the nurses.
[288:46.33]That's the fuck the Oscars guy.
[288:48.07]That is.
[288:48.55]It's him.
[288:49.01]It's him.
[288:49.29]It's him talking.
[288:49.83]That's absolutely him.
[288:50.69]Don't worry.
[288:51.35]I won't tell no one.
[288:52.83]Let me know if you see a doctor.
[288:54.51]Or a nurse.
[288:56.03]That is absolutely him.
[288:57.15]Yeah.
[288:58.23]He's like, that's the lead game designer.
[289:00.40]Of course he is.
[289:00.90]He's got to put himself in his own game.
[289:02.12]Why wouldn't he?
[289:05.04]It sure is a giant leap for mankind.
[289:07.88]Landed on the moon.
[289:08.84]Right now.
[289:11.66]I gave up.
[289:12.76]Get me out of this game.
[289:13.88]Quick.
[289:14.30]Get me out.
[289:15.16]Be a shame if somebody couldn't... Just get me out of it.
[289:17.74]I can't do it balanced properly, you know?
[289:20.15]I have 49.
[289:20.67]I'm going to have nightmares about this.
[289:22.39]I swear to God.
[289:25.95]It's the ghost, isn't it?
[289:28.25]Yeah.
[289:31.37]I'm going to ask a very intrusive question.
[289:33.13]I'm going to wake up in the middle of the night screaming because of this.
[289:36.65]I can watch TV.
[289:37.37]Watch.
[289:39.03]Yeah, I turned it on and sat there already.
[289:40.51]Ugh.
[289:40.59]Alright, baby.
[289:41.41]Are you ready to do this?
[289:42.88]What are- what are- what are we gonna name the baby?
[289:58.80]Excuse me, ma'am.
[289:59.54]That's up to you.
[290:00.00]That's not my baby.
[290:00.70]My wife just had a baby.
[290:02.24]What should I name the baby?
[290:04.11]Carol.
[290:04.49]I didn't think about that.
[290:07.33]What's her name again?
[290:09.09]Carol.
[290:09.69]Thank you.
[290:15.67]I'm going to name the baby Carbine.
[290:18.14]Yeah, name the baby Carbine.
[290:20.30]Hey, Leo.
[290:21.50]You coming?
[290:22.96]Come on, Leo.
[290:24.46]I'm right behind you.
[290:25.58]I'm literally standing behind you.
[290:27.57]He was right behind you.
[290:29.03]Honey, I'm home.
[290:36.21]May I see my face in the paper?
[290:37.45]You were right though.
[290:39.64]We had to do your storyline to like you.
[290:57.34]This is the background before your characters come to the no turning back point.
[291:02.66]They have to take care of their business now that they're on the outside.
[291:07.02]I love you a frog dog.
[291:09.26]I have to keep myself busy.
[291:11.70]I know what I'll do.
[291:25.75]Can I hold her?
[291:28.61]You got a chair in here?
[291:32.85]You can throw cards.
[291:36.91]Let's find out what I can do in my baby room.
[291:41.54]Okay, we just have to talk.
[291:43.00]This is important.
[291:50.78]49.
[291:52.08]The first and last time I'll ever hold my baby.
[291:55.13]There's gotta be a chair.
[291:56.07]No!
[291:56.63]I want a chair.
[291:58.99]Get eclipsed.
[292:00.65]She's so beautiful.
[292:04.17]She is.
[292:06.70]She's got my father's eyes.
[292:07.86]49 pick up.
[292:09.28]You know, I miss you.
[292:14.64]Vincent, please.
[292:17.65]I love you so much I just have to finish this it's for you you have to trust me walk into the scene I can't make it into that scene carol what do you want me to say
[292:35.65]Just want you to trust me, okay?
[292:38.19]Yeah, you're gonna name him... What's this guy's last name?
[292:39.75]Name him Carbine Connect.
[292:42.32]You keep saying that.
[292:43.52]That's his middle name.
[292:44.08]Why can't you get yourself killed?
[292:45.42]Because, I mean, that's... I can't live with that.
[292:47.42]Connect 4.
[292:47.74]I'm not gonna let that happen.
[292:50.04]I promise.
[292:52.06]You have to trust me, Carol.
[292:53.19]Carbine Connect 4 Anderson.
[293:03.35]Meanwhile car being connect 49 you're gonna find a disturbance in the hallway mm-hmm And it's called They're all out of fizzy Cola No, it's gonna be here come the cops Somebody ran it on us I don't know how they found us.
[293:24.42]I mean we only talked to every single person I
[293:28.56]Yeah, all you did to cover our tracks, you put a book over our faces.
[293:32.53]That sure did help.
[293:33.35]And we played balance in the wheelchairs.
[293:36.57]That was high comedy.
[293:39.43]That was actually made sense.
[293:41.83]Yeah, but that was like comedy.
[293:44.16]That was the goofy buffoon assistant.
[293:47.42]They had their own co-op game going there.
[293:49.12]That would have been a fun one to play.
[293:55.79]Out the window with you.
[294:00.57]She hates me.
[294:02.89]See, I'm telling you, there's been two people.
[294:05.27]Two guys got shot in the beginning.
[294:07.04]Remember when they were selling the diamond?
[294:08.56]Two cops.
[294:09.68]Two of us.
[294:10.94]Don't be surprised if you see... Where am I?
[294:15.44]This is my story, okay?
[294:17.00]Butt out.
[294:19.00]It's just a series of people doing their own co-op games.
[294:24.61]Oh, it is.
[294:24.97]Now it's my turn.
[294:25.63]Okay, this is pretty cool.
[294:30.93]Faster.
[294:32.09]My guy's slower than yours.
[294:35.17]Nice.
[294:35.47]Nice try.
[294:40.21]Good thing that door was open, otherwise that would have really hurt both of us.
[294:45.25]Surprise!
[294:45.77]It's the guy from the elevator.
[294:55.84]All the way down?
[295:09.13]I can't wait till we run into each other.
[295:12.45]Good slide.
[295:13.83]Thank you.
[295:17.59]I feel like we're running in circles.
[295:33.12]I'll distract him.
[295:33.66]What do you mean, is anybody in here?
[295:37.96]He just wanted you to turn himself in.
[295:41.22]Why would that ever happen?
[295:41.94]He was giving you the opportunity to say, I'm here.
[295:46.01]I'll go quietly.
[295:46.97]Should I go out the window?
[295:49.57]I don't know, but I'm very invested in what your next decision is going to be.
[295:54.49]There's a lot of cops in that hallway.
[295:58.10]Open.
[295:59.20]What are you... Oh, come on, really?
[296:01.32]What happened?
[296:01.80]What's going on here?
[296:02.46]Oh my god, I have to kick it again.
[296:04.42]I just barely made that.
[296:08.44]Good luck.
[296:10.80]That's so cool.
[296:13.95]That's really, really cool.
[296:17.41]You killed that guy by doing what you're doing.
[296:22.17]That'll stop him.
[296:30.05]Classic.
[296:32.21]Nice butt shot.
[296:35.81]Can't wait for the new mods.
[296:44.69]Are you in the same door?
[296:45.71]No.
[296:46.43]I think you're gonna... This is odd.
[296:49.59]Wow.
[296:50.65]This just became a different game.
[296:53.71]This is a beat-em-up game now.
[297:00.02]Nice.
[297:00.32]Okay, this is cool.
[297:01.60]We were talking about X-Men Arcade earlier.
[297:03.30]Oh, what the fuck?
[297:07.23]Oh, get a haymaker.
[297:08.79]Wow.
[297:11.69]That guy meant business.
[297:12.51]Holy shit.
[297:13.53]Okay.
[297:13.67]Do you have a block button?
[297:17.19]Nope.
[297:17.65]Hey, it's that guy from earlier.
[297:21.73]From the gas station.
[297:22.77]What, I got a desk lamp?
[297:26.53]That guy's dead.
[297:32.77]Oh, well.
[297:33.89]This guy just looked behind him.
[297:39.45]They checked his back.
[297:42.56]Yeah, I got a bowling trophy.
[297:43.90]I'm not afraid to use it.
[297:44.80]Look at these custom animations.
[297:53.06]Oh, boy.
[297:53.36]Oh, you're getting double teamed.
[297:55.28]Yeah, I am.
[297:55.68]No, you gotta do the classic...
[298:01.67]Oh, finally.
[298:04.16]Took him long enough.
[298:11.40]Why do you get to fight everybody?
[298:12.46]What am I doing?
[298:13.06]Crawling through vents?
[298:13.76]Well, you're the smart one.
[298:15.60]I'm the abrasive brass one that has big biceps.
[298:21.64]Okay, use your brain.
[298:25.88]Use your smarts.
[298:27.71]The camera really wants me to look that way.
[298:29.83]They're coming in.
[298:34.28]The camera is forcing me to look this direction.
[298:40.78]All of that just to get caught.
[298:43.18]I didn't get caught.
[298:43.84]That means I can run away.
[298:44.80]Alright, try again.
[298:48.42]Do you have to do the whole camp?
[298:53.59]No, no, no.
[298:58.63]You're the smart one.
[298:59.87]Immediately gets caught.
[299:04.51]Suspect is fine.
[299:07.97]Is it the window?
[299:08.69]Yeah, it looks like you can get out the window.
[299:10.85]Yeah, it is the window.
[299:11.47]Oh no, I thought it was going to be smarter than crawling outside.
[299:16.10]Check the windows.
[299:16.92]Ooh, good move.
[299:17.76]Sneaky.
[299:36.79]Now we're talking.
[299:38.39]I'm leaving you behind again.
[299:42.25]We've almost made it out completely alive.
[299:51.59]Well, that seems to be working.
[299:52.77]I would continue doing it.
[299:53.53]Don't they make glass shatterproof?
[299:58.23]Whatever.
[299:58.53]Your turn to be old boy again.
[300:05.47]Or take a hostage.
[300:07.13]I got a hostage here.
[300:09.63]I'll threaten you, ceiling.
[300:13.21]They ran away.
[300:15.67]The cop on the left is... Maybe.
[300:17.13]You got three left.
[300:18.25]Okay, I got a door here.
[300:37.84]Oh, man.
[300:38.34]Look at how slowly they're slugging over here.
[300:40.88]Just ask one of them to open it for you.
[300:42.80]Excuse me, can you open this?
[300:46.55]You probably just, like, killed people in the floor above you, actually.
[300:49.85]Maybe.
[300:50.11]Depends on where they were seated.
[300:51.95]This is the best strat.
[301:00.25]Just calmly walk out of the... Oh, damn.
[301:03.23]You gotta know where to go.
[301:08.99]Just go be a human.
[301:12.69]Nice.
[301:14.99]Good evening, ma'am.
[301:16.11]Good evening, officer.
[301:17.35]We have two fugitives at large in the hospital right now.
[301:20.05]I know, I know.
[301:20.93]My colleague just called me.
[301:22.25]I think it's these two guys in the paper.
[301:23.88]Yes.
[301:24.14]Have you seen them at all?
[301:25.88]No.
[301:26.64]Are they dangerous in any way?
[301:28.48]Guy on the right.
[301:29.36]I don't think so.
[301:30.08]Not yet.
[301:30.68]Stay away and call for any of us, okay?
[301:33.63]I'm gonna laugh if I bust through the door.
[301:36.65]Uh-oh.
[301:36.77]Uh-oh.
[301:38.13]You got a patrolman.
[301:39.07]What am I supposed to do?
[301:40.42]Oh, he's good.
[301:41.24]They just wanted me to get scared.
[301:42.46]What?! !
[301:55.31]I pushed circle and he was facing the other way.
[302:00.82]I waited until he passed me by.
[302:03.06]Why am I the one that gets caught every single time?
[302:05.68]I smelled him.
[302:08.06]Maybe go a little bit further down, like to one of the other chairs.
[302:11.91]I waited until he was passed.
[302:14.47]I did.
[302:16.77]I smelled him.
[302:17.81]There he is.
[302:24.10]I guess you just have to sit there.
[302:25.24]Alright, my apologies.
[302:29.07]We gotta listen to this one once more.
[302:35.00]Don't give me the cancel button.
[302:37.34]Look, I'm going to show you when I push the button.
[302:42.60]Oh, yeah.
[302:44.09]It was right when they went.
[302:45.41]At that point, they were already gone.
[302:46.95]They were already there.
[302:48.45]This is where they freak out a little bit.
[302:51.31]Stay safe, ma'am.
[303:03.39]Press O to get caught.
[303:04.61]Yeah, basically.
[303:06.88]He was there.
[303:07.32]Alright, I would say at this point you're in the clear.
[303:13.40]No, I'm not doing it until the camera zooms out.
[303:15.66]Yeah, you're good.
[303:17.56]Save guy turns around.
[303:20.04]But he's in the room with me still.
[303:24.74]All those little arrows make me think I'm about to get shot from like seven locations.
[303:33.02]Good work.
[303:37.02]Back to sprinting around.
[303:38.68]Wow.
[303:39.70]All that hiding.
[303:40.62]There you go.
[303:42.12]Out the window.
[303:44.02]Raising.
[303:47.96]That is... Your whole body does not work after that one.
[303:51.52]Correct.
[303:52.14]You've still got a hostage, by the way.
[303:53.66]Mm-hmm.
[303:55.62]Oh, my God.
[304:03.33]Why is he still coming closer?
[304:05.17]Yeah, I don't think I can do anything.
[304:06.85]What?
[304:07.13]I don't think I lost.
[304:17.11]Oh, the classic.
[304:17.67]The classic.
[304:18.03]They got one arm in each hand.
[304:22.49]What?
[304:22.61]You're going to drive the car through the glass.
[304:27.37]I know, but the car's way down here.
[304:29.13]You can find a way.
[304:29.93]You're going to have to go over a ramp.
[304:33.06]Oh, you're getting arrested right now.
[304:36.69]Yeah, you gotta help me.
[304:44.31]That was odd.
[304:46.17]Right into us.
[304:46.53]I was holding the trigger down.
[304:51.07]Are you kidding me?
[304:52.31]What a matrix move that was.
[304:57.63]That guy has superhuman skill.
[305:01.96]Uh, this looks really grim for you.
[305:05.61]There's a guy with a gun pointed at your head right now.
[305:08.07]That dodge was so amazing.
[305:13.61]Woah, what?!
[305:16.29]You got shot like six times!
[305:21.33]That was... Never should have happened.
[305:23.74]The Matrix, they all knew you were getting away at the exact same moment.
[305:29.23]they weren't shooting me the guy like driving into all of them they shot you running away yeah I died probably four times there yeah that was a public execution yeah there was probably honestly at least 15 officers all shooting guns in my direction at the same time yeah though they all turned as one like agent smith somebody hit me one two somebody hit me in like the heel
[305:59.58]Yeah, it was a firing squad.
[306:03.89]Alright, time to get in the air.
[306:06.83]Here we are.
[306:07.53]We are probably at the climax of the game right here.
[306:10.37]This is probably the third act.
[306:11.51]Yep.
[306:22.93]It'd be really funny if one of us could actually fly the plane.
[306:25.89]Yeah, that'd be so funny.
[306:26.87]I feel like there's got to be something related to that.
[306:29.71]Oh, ow!
[306:30.60]God damn it.
[306:31.80]That hurt.
[306:32.88]Did you face plant?
[306:34.56]No, I like... A finger planted.
[306:38.86]That's probably going to be so awful for chat.
[306:40.28]I'm so sorry, everybody.
[306:41.10]I apologize profusely.
[306:47.27]Wow.
[306:47.43]My knuckles are killing me right now.
[306:49.17]I just like punched my microphone.
[306:51.24]Oof.
[306:51.36]Double what?
[306:51.68]What am I paying you?
[306:52.70]Double or nothing.
[307:14.45]I don't even have any money.
[307:17.14]I couldn't even afford to call on the phone a few minutes ago.
[307:20.72]How do you know it's not like a quarter to fly this plane?
[307:27.00]I just take my spare change from buying the pack of six.
[307:29.32]This is the guy that got away.
[307:32.80]This guy just gets tortured in this game.
[307:34.79]That's all he's done.
[307:45.00]Give him the drill.
[307:49.94]Let him go.
[307:52.55]With a different voice, he's the stranger thing, Sheriff.
[307:55.63]You're doing the right thing, Harvey.
[307:57.51]You're good, Harvey.
[307:58.29]You're a good man.
[307:59.63]Thank you so much.
[308:03.56]What are you thinking?
[308:05.12]We need more men.
[308:06.26]He's coming.
[308:06.96]Got it.
[308:08.68]More men.
[308:09.28]One more man, right?
[308:10.70]Is that what he said?
[308:11.52]He said one.
[308:11.94]Does it fit?
[308:12.58]Are these like SWAT vests?
[308:13.62]Something like that.
[308:35.68]vincent who is this emily really don't even ask it's his daughter it's his first child you ready wow spoilers yeah I just need to tell you you can tell just you have brown hair in a goatee the gas tank's right over there yeah uh might not be the daughter then uh she has blonde hair thank you what do you think is this a good landing spot let me see I mean yeah she's pretty old it's gonna be a long walk through a dense jungle
[309:06.17]And would he put his daughter through this?
[309:09.49]That would get you way closer.
[309:10.49]I don't know.
[309:11.37]Depends on how... No thanks.
[309:13.58]I'm not good with heights.
[309:14.90]Whatever you want.
[309:16.56]Wait, Emily.
[309:17.10]Do you have a parachute?
[309:19.74]I do.
[309:20.58]Hello, Vincent.
[309:21.66]You crazy?
[309:22.22]Don't say food.
[309:22.78]I'm hungry now.
[309:23.18]Do you know how much time that would save us?
[309:25.37]I don't care.
[309:25.91]Too bad.
[309:26.41]I haven't even seen a parachute before.
[309:28.43]It's not that hard.
[309:29.41]Talking about cheeseburgers all game.
[309:30.99]We're going to get a decision to parachute out.
[309:32.65]Well, technically, you're right.
[309:35.73]Come on.
[309:36.73]What do you say?
[309:37.27]Wait, what was the dialogue here?
[309:39.93]Parachute or land the plane.
[309:41.21]Dude, we don't even need to make a decision on this one.
[309:46.58]Yeah, but if land the plane, what if you get to help land the plane?
[309:50.84]This is tricky.
[309:52.48]There is a small chance that you get to help land the plane.
[309:56.08]Yeah, there is a chance that we're going to be like, hit the gas tank, and we're going down, and somebody has to pilot the plane.
[310:02.00]There is just like that small possibility.
[310:04.34]Yeah, let's make a poll.
[310:05.60]We'll just let Chad pick.
[310:07.96]Yeah.
[310:11.40]I'm going to say parachute or land plane.
[310:24.01]Here you go.
[310:26.02]Put that in your chat.
[310:27.10]Alright.
[310:29.96]Probably one of the last decisions of the game, I would assume.
[310:32.81]Well, yeah.
[310:33.83]Besides whatever the finale decision is, then yeah.
[310:41.75]Every time we stand here to do a decision, my PS4 cranks up to a thousand.
[310:47.79]The fan just goes... Does it go re... Yeah, kind of.
[310:56.46]Does it go re like that like four to one parachute?
[311:01.26]Yeah, this looks like it's a land plane.
[311:05.14]It looks like three to one parachute.
[311:06.46]Whatever.
[311:07.34]Three to one.
[311:07.62]It is definitely parachute.
[311:09.42]Yeah, sorry guys.
[311:11.20]The democracy has spoken.
[311:15.59]Oh shit.
[311:16.99]Alright, alright.
[311:17.99]I mean...
[311:19.31]How hard can it be, right?
[311:20.85]Don't worry.
[311:22.13]You'll figure it out.
[311:23.36]On your way down.
[311:25.40]Hey, that's not even funny.
[311:27.26]Relax.
[311:28.56]I'll show you the basics before we jump.
[311:31.28]Yeah, you better.
[311:32.62]Are you being cocky now?
[311:34.03]What?
[311:34.79]No, whatever.
[311:35.71]Just show me the basics.
[311:36.91]I got this.
[311:37.75]Good.
[311:39.09]Emily, I'll handle the fuel.
[311:40.91]All right.
[311:45.62]He thought I said pair of shoes?
[311:47.22]Sorry, that's just, it's coming with us.
[311:49.28]Just get it on the plane, okay?
[311:51.08]Got it.
[311:52.00]Guns.
[311:53.54]Lots of guns.
[311:55.34]And by lots, you mean two.
[311:56.94]Guys, can you please find my locker?
[311:58.64]I'm talking about the Matrix earlier.
[311:59.62]There's minigames in here.
[312:03.04]You already get on the plane.
[312:03.86]Oh, there's minigames?
[312:05.38]I don't know.
[312:05.84]It's just the open area.
[312:06.81]You got to take that possibility.
[312:08.15]I forgot this is the toy game.
[312:09.17]No, you're right, you're right.
[312:10.87]I never saw this one coming.
[312:12.81]My own picture in the paper.
[312:17.60]You go hydrate, right, guys?
[312:18.86]Not to mention we do actually have to get the plane ready to go before we sit inside of it.
[312:22.67]I'm going to grab a cup that's literally right to the right of the jug.
[312:27.45]Okay.
[312:33.51]Moldy sandwich in there.
[312:36.74]Why do you always sample everything?
[312:38.52]Your character eats all the old stuff.
[312:40.74]I just wanted to see what it is.
[312:46.36]Alright, turn off fuel flow.
[312:48.70]Get Emily's logbook.
[312:52.63]Alright, Emily.
[312:53.69]Detach the hose.
[312:55.63]Listen, your dad's not coming back for a long time after this, okay?
[312:59.15]We gotta do so many errands for people.
[313:03.33]Here's the logbook.
[313:05.57]Um... Okay.
[313:08.35]Is that a video game?
[313:10.39]Yes, this is a video game here.
[313:12.43]Hey, this is a reused asset.
[313:15.60]You're gonna get over here and play Santa paper that one was in the prison Yeah, I'm coming hang on Okay, there's actually many games this time like a real game No, it's just it's beach ball beach volleyball What here it comes
[313:44.62]What happened?
[313:45.88]I didn't hit it?
[313:46.96]How did I not hit it?
[313:48.00]What?
[313:48.50]How?
[314:04.45]I'm playing myself.
[314:06.47]Oh my god.
[314:07.65]Yeah.
[314:10.35]Nice.
[314:12.10]Nice.
[314:12.92]One more and I win.
[314:13.64]I'll come back.
[314:14.38]One more?
[314:14.80]You mean it's best to seven?
[314:17.95]Yeah, four is seven.
[314:19.09]No, it's the first person to get to seven.
[314:26.61]Glitch.
[314:27.09]Oh, fuck that.
[314:32.37]What happened there?
[314:33.67]I don't know.
[314:34.63]That hit the ground.
[314:36.25]That did not hit the ground.
[314:37.31]Yes, it did.
[314:38.53]Not on my screen.
[314:49.41]No way.
[314:52.89]What is happening?
[314:53.69]Oh, yeah.
[314:54.27]Oh, yeah.
[314:55.85]Oh, yeah.
[314:58.33]The game has exploded twice on for you.
[315:00.73]Uh, yeah.
[315:02.57]Uh-oh.
[315:03.52]Uh-oh.
[315:04.00]Something fucking fishy is going on here.
[315:06.80]Check your frames.
[315:08.56]No, I'm good.
[315:10.02]Okay.
[315:10.50]Because you were like kind of a robot for a second.
[315:12.52]Uh-oh.
[315:22.84]Come on.
[315:24.67]What?
[315:26.49]That went right through me.
[315:27.95]Oh, we were orange.
[315:29.01]That's why.
[315:33.79]What happened?
[315:35.77]One more.
[315:36.51]One more.
[315:36.96]That's all I need.
[315:37.68]I went right through it.
[315:43.72]I went right through it.
[315:44.94]I went right through the ball.
[315:48.32]I want to talk about it.
[315:50.12]No, that's fucking bullshit.
[315:54.54]Somebody clip that and send that to his chat.
[315:59.89]Hope you choke on that.
[316:09.99]How many times can you do it?
[316:19.92]Am I supposed to spot you?
[316:25.16]I can't get the... 10 is like... Can you see my progress bar or no?
[316:29.48]Yeah, I can.
[316:36.38]It looks like you have a bad internet connection trying to load a YouTube video or something.
[316:41.34]Alright, I'm... You know, 10's good.
[316:44.72]10's good.
[316:45.44]11 would have been impossible.
[316:47.55]Let's see.
[316:48.05]You're good.
[316:48.91]Go ahead.
[316:49.47]Let's see if I can do this.
[316:53.65]Let's get to... Let's get there.
[316:55.92]Gotta get to 11.
[316:56.38]Have fun.
[316:58.48]Let's get there first.
[317:09.00]And then I'll fucking really speed it up.
[317:17.48]Nice, looking good.
[317:22.79]Nice chopper.
[317:27.77]He's trying so hard, by the way, Jack.
[317:30.39]He's trying so hard.
[317:32.49]You have no idea.
[317:34.17]Oh, my whole body!
[317:35.59]Wait a minute, hold on, I got it.
[317:37.54]I told you.
[317:38.20]My chest is burning.
[317:40.64]If I wasn't wearing this heavy vest, I'd have it easy.
[317:42.50]My chest is on fire.
[317:43.44]I'm gonna have a heart attack.
[317:51.62]Wow, he did it.
[317:53.24]He did it.
[318:02.90]Better leave it alone.
[318:11.45]Let me try.
[318:12.13]I'll give you a letter.
[318:12.83]Let me try one more time.
[318:13.41]Let me try 12.
[318:13.75]I think I can do it.
[318:20.33]He's got to mentally prepare for this.
[318:27.84]Is your controller on a desk?
[318:29.10]I think he's cheating, Chad.
[318:32.46]He's not even holding the controller.
[318:35.10]Definitely a desk rattle in there.
[318:38.82]He's using two hands.
[318:42.86]Oh, that's not impossible.
[318:44.60]Pretty sure it's not possible.
[318:45.62]Oh, that's not... I mean... Whew!
[318:47.23]Whew!
[318:50.69]You're working up an actual sweat in real life.
[318:52.65]Dude, my hand.
[318:54.05]My hand is in pain right now.
[319:03.25]No fucking way.
[319:10.91]Just get a pen?
[319:12.23]That's actually a pretty good idea.
[319:14.17]Come here and beat my score.
[319:18.94]Where are you?
[319:22.78]Gotta beat a hundred.
[319:25.25]Good luck.
[319:29.51]Oh yeah, you're still here?
[319:31.05]Forgot about you, honey.
[319:33.89]Yeah, we really are just completely forgetting about her.
[319:41.82]Oh, you can zoom in?
[319:42.56]Yeah, I guess so.
[319:44.08]Well, I did all mine zoomed out.
[319:47.36]So, uh, extra hard mode.
[319:51.02]Hey, this game's not for me.
[319:54.56]My finger's right.
[319:55.38]I can't do that shit.
[319:57.12]I won arcade.
[319:58.04]You won bench press.
[319:59.40]I win darkness.
[320:01.11]All right, I'll take it.
[320:01.85]Bench press just took like three years off of my life.
[320:04.77]All right, give her the logbook.
[320:08.73]You have the logbook.
[320:15.05]You got the door open?
[320:15.69]Good.
[320:15.87]Let's do it.
[320:22.23]I think there's like another side to the door.
[320:25.59]Yeah.
[320:26.51]Thanks, bud.
[320:27.03]Don't worry.
[320:28.08]I'm handling it.
[320:30.38]Old man over here.
[320:36.30]You are doing everything on your own.
[320:39.54]Go to the helicopter.
[320:40.64]What helicopter?
[320:42.80]Oh, I already went out too.
[320:44.22]It's outside.
[320:44.74]I just opened the door and shut the door.
[320:48.02]I don't know why it's there.
[320:49.86]Maybe we need to do it together.
[320:51.96]Oh.
[320:53.72]You think?
[320:55.42]Probably.
[320:56.72]Okay.
[320:57.34]Where is it?
[321:02.18]Follow me.
[321:13.55]Alright.
[321:16.75]Okay.
[321:19.75]Can I fly the helicopter?
[321:22.27]No, I can't.
[321:25.59]Are you shitting me right now?
[321:38.06]Let me in!
[321:40.88]Irreparable damage.
[321:42.40]That would have been nice if I could have flown it.
[321:43.64]I think it's just an easter egg.
[321:47.41]Yeah, it is.
[321:49.51]It's just a little joke.
[321:52.43]To make you laugh.
[322:02.69]Somebody said, Jesus, I've had nightmares about that.
[322:06.05]About getting into a helicopter.
[322:08.84]Getting in and having it turn on and being like, oh shit, I can't do anything about it.
[322:12.34]Alright.
[322:16.54]Final act.
[322:25.22]This video game would be miserable if you didn't stop for any of the minigames.
[322:31.16]Probably.
[322:31.58]Like, imagine not playing a single one.
[322:35.91]Well, I mean, that's why the game is co-op only, pretty much by design.
[322:39.49]It's for you and a friend to kind of just do what we're doing.
[322:42.69]Yeah.
[322:43.69]Dick around and play with all the random toys.
[322:49.94]You nervous?
[322:50.40]No.
[322:52.06]You?
[322:54.02]You?
[322:55.76]A little bit.
[322:57.44]Just enough to keep me focused, you know?
[322:59.92]That's good.
[323:01.08]Yeah.
[323:01.26]I don't even know how long the game is.
[323:05.42]The game is about six... You'll know in a minute.
[323:07.62]Yeah, you'll know probably in about 15 minutes.
[323:11.26]You know, I've been thinking about your situation with your wife.
[323:16.08]I might have a solution for you.
[323:18.24]Because you're going to see the credits pretty soon.
[323:22.17]You should write her a letter.
[323:24.49]What?
[323:26.67]Look, I don't mean to interfere, but I had a similar situation with Linda.
[323:30.78]So I decided to write her a letter.
[323:33.76]And it worked.
[323:35.22]This is the 70s.
[323:36.25]Remember, they can't just cell phone each other.
[323:38.73]I'm just saying that writing a letter really helped.
[323:42.23]Plus, the ladies like a handwritten letter, you know?
[323:44.45]Of course.
[323:44.75]It's up to you.
[323:45.57]That's true.
[323:46.33]Chose more effort.
[323:47.25]When was the last time you wrote a letter?
[323:50.72]When's the last time I wrote anything?
[323:52.42]A check.
[323:55.54]I wrote a check today.
[323:56.24]There you go.
[323:57.82]That's the only thing we use writing for at this point.
[324:01.10]A letter, though.
[324:02.70]Actually writing somebody a letter.
[324:05.98]To be real, it was probably Santa Claus when I was eight.
[324:09.92]I'm not even kidding.
[324:19.61]All right, parachute.
[324:21.65]Chat chose it.
[324:22.97]No land the plane.
[324:25.96]Hot drop and guns ready.
[324:28.26]We're approaching the drop point.
[324:30.38]You guys ready to jump?
[324:31.82]Yeah.
[324:32.88]Oh, we got to our next shot gun.
[324:34.60]Okay, Arnold.
[324:35.52]Yeah.
[324:37.71]Okay, remember.
[324:38.87]That was a pretty good Arnold impression.
[324:40.33]Somebody clip that and watch that right now.
[324:41.61]Seriously, that was perfect, Arnold.
[324:42.93]And don't forget to pull the shooting time.
[324:45.81]Which one do I pull?
[324:47.35]This one?
[324:48.26]Yeah, that one.
[324:50.26]Like this.
[324:51.20]I'm going to regret this.
[324:55.62]Alright.
[324:56.42]Are you ready?
[324:57.12]I'm ready.
[325:00.03]Oh, we get to fly around.
[325:03.15]Oh, man.
[325:04.83]Hold on.
[325:05.15]Come here.
[325:27.88]Oh, that's too bad.
[325:28.44]Can you turn around?
[325:29.60]I don't think so.
[325:30.94]Can we, like, grab each other?
[325:31.92]Can we grab hands and spin around?
[325:33.90]I'm gonna, like, land on you.
[325:39.51]I'm gonna have to help you.
[325:40.99]I'm coming, buddy!
[325:41.51]Come on, quick!
[325:41.93]I'm dying!
[325:42.27]That's not for fucking!
[325:57.18]Are you kidding me?
[325:59.64]Looking on your screen.
[326:01.40]I'm just floating around.
[326:03.62]Why am I just floating around on your screen?
[326:05.50]Shouldn't I be falling?
[326:06.44]I guess we're falling at the same speed.
[326:07.62]We're both falling at the same speed.
[326:11.82]Come on Vincent.
[326:13.50]Just upside down.
[326:13.97]I can't get to you.
[326:14.97]I'm floating around.
[326:15.95]I'm going for a rock to see if I can get 10 points.
[326:23.83]Almost there.
[326:29.75]Oh, come on.
[326:31.44]That's like GTA 5.
[326:33.20]When you get killed.
[326:36.44]And they do like the wasted animation before they let you see the ragdoll physics.
[326:43.86]Alright, might as well just pull the parachute.
[326:51.01]Why am I this fast now?
[326:54.13]Hold W and point your mouse at the screen.
[326:56.39]Point your mouse down and hold W, right?
[327:03.34]Here, pull up for a second.
[327:04.42]Alright, I'll be like below you.
[327:06.72]Now you're falling like faster than me.
[327:08.51]That scream.
[327:08.87]I'm coming to you.
[327:09.81]Just stay there.
[327:12.19]I'm gonna come to you.
[327:29.30]Swim to me, man.
[327:30.05]I'm swimming to you in the air ocean.
[327:32.57]Here I come.
[327:35.41]Alright, come here.
[327:38.97]Alright, we're good.
[327:43.10]Pull the cord, man.
[327:47.22]We'd all react the same.
[327:48.44]Yeah, we definitely would.
[327:52.50]This is- my baby grew up so fast.
[327:54.90]Yeah, I'm way too old to be sitting in this thing.
[327:57.64]He just dumped us in the ocean.
[327:59.24]God, it's too long this sequel.
[328:00.88]It is too long, yeah.
[328:02.40]The opportunity was the splat.
[328:18.59]I wouldn't do that.
[328:42.68]What if I, what if I comp short here?
[328:44.88]Um, I don't know.
[328:46.66]No, I was going to say you'll probably get a cutscene.
[328:49.82]He lands on top of him.
[328:50.94]Squishes him flat like a pancake and lies on top of him.
[329:05.79]was the last time I listened to your ideas take it easy you're still alive aren't you I'm just saying I almost died no you didn't let's get going all right the guns work yet no uh they do not still got the diamond I do we're doing like guys you're sure about that interesting how it changes from horizontal to vertical excuse me like halo flashbacks well I'm actually good at what I do
[329:38.11]Alright, we're about to play the most dangerous game.
[329:41.76]Come on.
[329:42.76]Hunting humans.
[329:43.74]I wonder how much is actually left in the game.
[329:46.74]I feel like, I mean, this is definitely the finale.
[329:48.55]Yeah.
[329:48.69]There's definitely going to be like a long, like a lengthy firefight.
[329:54.91]But besides that.
[329:58.89]Are we actually going to be able to shoot guns now?
[330:00.71]Yeah, we didn't shoot the American cops, but now that we're in Mexico, anything goes.
[330:05.36]I have a shotgun.
[330:07.50]Not going to be that great.
[330:09.72]I'm going to give you cover.
[330:12.90]Okay.
[330:13.66]There's three guys down there, two of them standing side by side, one patrol.
[330:19.30]Okay.
[330:20.27]Three.
[330:20.79]Wait, wait, wait.
[330:21.11]No, I got a shotgun, man.
[330:22.09]I gotta get him closer.
[330:22.65]Okay, well, you're the one that started the countdown.
[330:24.43]I was just going with it.
[330:25.31]I was going with the flow.
[330:26.53]No, I said there were three of them.
[330:27.89]I didn't say that wasn't, like, three.
[330:28.83]I thought you were gonna go three, two, one, because there's two guys.
[330:31.55]I want you to go bingo-bango on the one-two, and I'll get the guy down here.
[330:36.56]Go for it.
[330:37.16]Just help me get one of these front two guys, and then I'll... I'm right in front.
[330:39.98]You ready?
[330:40.30]I'm gonna get the guy with the blue shirt.
[330:41.60]Okay, I'm gonna get the guy... No, you're closer to the white shirt.
[330:43.74]All right, I'll get the white shirt guy.
[330:44.72]Ready?
[330:46.07]Three, two, one, go.
[330:50.11]Got him.
[330:50.31]Okay, we got one in cover.
[330:54.93]On the coast.
[330:55.53]Oh, we got two more rolling up.
[330:59.42]I'm in a real bad spot, apparently.
[331:04.58]They're all sliding around.
[331:05.66]It's alright, they're good.
[331:08.78]I got the shotgun.
[331:09.80]The shotgun in the knee.
[331:12.94]Hey, sometimes, yeah, it's hard to aim.
[331:16.13]Gets a little tricky.
[331:17.75]Alright, we gotta go up.
[331:25.83]Hey, listen, we're playing with controllers here, guys.
[331:28.52]No, we are on the PlayStation 4.
[331:29.84]Get over here and help me.
[331:36.48]Acrobatic of you.
[331:44.37]Ooh, sniper.
[331:46.67]I can handle that.
[331:47.39]I brought my... Carving.
[331:50.29]Stay low.
[331:52.87]That way.
[331:53.86]No, that's not even a carbine.
[331:54.88]You're using a... Yeah, I am.
[331:56.65]You sent me out a rifle.
[331:58.03]You're using a rifle from Call of Duty World at War.
[332:00.95]Hey, this is an army of two moment we've got going on here.
[332:04.29]Alright, so I don't want to have my head poking through there.
[332:08.04]Okay, I've got one more... I've got one more piece of defenses on my space invaders thing.
[332:13.96]I don't think I'm allowed to shoot him from here.
[332:21.26]Yeah, on my space invader cheese, I only had one more shot left.
[332:24.78]Alright, do you need some cover?
[332:34.82]Oh yeah, I can't get to you?
[332:36.02]Alright, I'm gonna come out here and shoot him.
[332:37.78]Oh, he's shooting at me right now.
[332:41.50]Well, he was.
[332:54.83]Might be a bad idea, but I'm doing it anyways.
[333:00.46]Talix has carbine one more time.
[333:02.00]Oh, they're ambushing the sniper.
[333:03.74]Do it.
[333:08.82]Can I take the sniper?
[333:09.90]Nice.
[333:11.00]The sniper run.
[333:13.68]I'll stay up here and keep you covered.
[333:15.88]This should definitely be reversed, but okay.
[333:18.10]Oh, yeah, it should.
[333:25.95]That guy died?
[333:30.38]We good?
[333:31.70]Yes, we are.
[333:41.48]You good with that guy?
[333:42.24]I'll get the guy at the top.
[333:43.22]Oh, you got him.
[333:44.88]I can't see that guy.
[333:46.46]Anybody else?
[333:49.56]Okay.
[333:50.98]Probably, but I need to make my way into that door, don't I?
[333:53.93]I think so.
[333:56.85]I think you're good.
[333:59.15]Alright, there's some on your side now, I think.
[334:08.96]That guy's arm's just, like, spaghetti'd.
[334:10.92]That was great.
[334:12.16]Alright, you're good.
[334:13.56]What?
[334:15.28]Alright, the guy up top is the real nuisance here.
[334:22.72]You don't understand, that guy...
[334:25.69]That, like, combat roll that he did.
[334:27.36]I can't even.
[334:29.24]Oh, that was so dumb.
[334:31.00]You got one guy left.
[334:34.45]I got it.
[334:34.85]I got it.
[334:35.49]It's under control.
[334:37.43]Okay.
[334:38.19]You're definitely dead now.
[334:40.90]You're good.
[334:48.88]Shit.
[334:50.48]Up top.
[334:50.98]Oh, God.
[334:52.16]Guy up high.
[334:54.40]This is limited time cover, apparently.
[334:56.12]I'm good.
[334:59.30]Well, that guy's not dead.
[334:59.94]That guy's just... Alright, we're fine.
[335:02.07]I'm almost dead.
[335:03.11]I want to, like, no scope shoot them.
[335:09.59]This is my first fucking SLR to use with an analog controller.
[335:13.06]Alright, I think we got him.
[335:17.42]Whenever I use an analog controller and I'm sniping, it really just feels like somebody has their hands around my neck.
[335:22.33]They're just squeezing.
[335:25.35]That's all it feels like.
[335:26.11]It just feels like somebody's squeezing their hands around my neck.
[335:28.85]Not that hard, but hard enough where it's a pain in the ass.
[335:31.97]Hey.
[335:38.14]Perfect.
[335:40.34]Why would we come down on the other side that we're supposed to be on from the...
[335:45.05]Co-op event.
[335:45.61]I don't know.
[335:46.23]Looks like we're not using this bridge.
[335:47.45]Who knows?
[335:50.33]I've made this kind of jump before.
[335:51.63]My turn.
[336:05.52]Covering fire?
[336:06.06]Is that what you were planning on doing?
[336:08.42]That was the intention, yeah.
[336:10.70]But first, help me move this heavy trash can.
[336:13.02]Yeah, so those of you that are watching both streams, I would recommend opening both streams, and then zooming in to just only the perspective of the person you're watching, so then you can have two big screens and not a split screen.
[336:25.06]Yeah, then you just have to constantly move it around every single time the screen shifts.
[336:28.62]No, you could have two windows, one just pancaked on top of the other one.
[336:33.32]One of them's my stream, and you crop out your window, enlarge it,
[336:38.60]Do the same thing with yours and just have it and put it in the... Whoops.
[336:47.32]You know, so you can enlarge it and put them on one on top of the other.
[336:51.44]So you could have kind of a dual screen and be able to watch the screen.
[337:00.81]From both of our perspectives, you know.
[337:05.19]I don't know what I'm doing right now.
[337:06.27]I'm just kind of running out there.
[337:14.74]I don't know.
[337:15.04]The semi-auto seemed like a decent idea when we were looking at the trunk.
[337:19.58]But now, not so much.
[337:23.82]Oh boy, I'm dead.
[337:24.98]Anybody near me?
[337:25.78]Got you.
[337:26.60]Good.
[337:27.46]Double headshot.
[337:30.24]I'm just going to run around.
[337:31.24]I'm going to be the rusher.
[337:34.02]And then I miss like four.
[337:36.50]Nobody saw that.
[337:42.91]Why did I give that guy a chance?
[337:48.60]Perfect teamwork.
[337:49.78]One more guy back there?
[337:50.58]No.
[337:52.84]Flawless.
[337:56.44]Let's go through the gate.
[337:57.52]Hurry up.
[337:58.38]Is there a melee?
[338:01.38]This was a mistake.
[338:02.44]Is there a melee?
[338:03.02]I don't think so.
[338:06.72]Are you going to take care of that guy?
[338:14.88]Yep.
[338:16.55]I sure am.
[338:18.13]Hold on.
[338:19.59]Watch out.
[338:19.99]There's like a hundred people over there.
[338:22.41]Is there a grenade in here or something?
[338:24.11]No, but they're all shooting at me right now.
[338:25.71]So anything you want to do would be good.
[338:33.50]Like all of them are shooting at me, actually.
[338:35.88]Well, I do have a shotgun.
[338:43.46]This thing is like some bullet spread or something.
[338:46.68]Here we go.
[338:47.62]I'm going in.
[338:54.84]Got him.
[338:56.12]Nice work.
[338:56.86]Just to make sure.
[338:57.38]Yeah, just to make sure.
[339:00.19]Other side.
[339:03.69]Anybody coming up here?
[339:05.17]Car?
[339:06.55]I think time for the car segment.
[339:12.10]No?
[339:12.42]I think we have to open the door.
[339:15.24]With a car?
[339:16.20]With a car.
[339:17.66]Crash through with a car?
[339:20.87]We don't have any instructions, so I don't know.
[339:25.23]What is that all the way back there?
[339:35.44]No.
[339:37.36]Did we miss an enemy?
[339:38.20]It's possible.
[339:40.75]good question uh there's a broken fence here well they were definitely guarding like this door the big golden one in particular just right here no yes is it not this truck drive it down uh yeah it's pushed the truck down the hill so perfectly by the way don't ask me how I have no idea uh I just got hit in the lip with water
[340:10.32]From like the ceiling?
[340:11.14]From the ceiling.
[340:12.25]Water just dripped into my mouth.
[340:13.83]Are you leaking?
[340:14.85]I don't know.
[340:16.47]That doesn't sound good to me.
[340:20.55]Water just hit me in the mouth from the ceiling.
[340:24.65]Oh.
[340:27.69]Yeah.
[340:29.19]Oh, they heard my prayers.
[340:30.93]Hold on a minute.
[340:33.23]Let me look at my ceiling for a second.
[340:41.55]Meanwhile You later German Nevermind I'm so this was easy right now.
[340:46.23]Oh
[341:09.28]No, my own saliva.
[341:10.22]It was cold and dripped into my mouth.
[341:14.69]Did you get some snot?
[341:16.17]No, it was... I don't know, man.
[341:17.55]That's freaking me out.
[341:20.37]I'm going to stay with the shotgun.
[341:22.05]I like it.
[341:23.29]I switched to the MP5.
[341:25.33]If I could lay down some covering fire.
[341:29.34]I would.
[341:32.28]I got the wrong headphone.
[341:34.70]So you're a lefty.
[341:37.02]I guess so.
[341:42.44]Gonna call the Ghostbusters.
[341:43.36]Yeah, I just got slimed.
[341:44.28]That was so off.
[341:50.12]It was pretty off, yeah, but I was just trusting in the psychic link.
[341:55.24]Do it without saying when.
[341:57.30]Condensation?
[341:57.92]Yeah, but that was just really odd.
[342:00.34]There shouldn't be condensation in my room.
[342:09.51]Well, you died.
[342:12.45]That's very lightly.
[342:13.91]I thought I could go and take a different position, but no.
[342:17.09]They're shooting us from some kind of like battlefield.
[342:19.27]I made it.
[342:19.59]How did I make that and you didn't instantly?
[342:22.25]How did you make it, but I didn't.
[342:23.97]You instantly died.
[342:25.39]All right, I'll go get him.
[342:26.01]It doesn't even make any sense.
[342:27.05]I'm going to shoot him through the munchkin wizard of Osdorff.
[342:33.14]Okay, you can't do anything about that.
[342:34.78]No, you can't.
[342:35.36]You have to go around.
[342:40.56]All right, let's go.
[342:44.87]Okay, the first time they got me, there's no excuse for what they did.
[342:49.55]So, how are we supposed to go about doing this?
[342:52.35]Just run?
[342:54.91]Uh... Like, okay.
[342:59.89]I'm so glad that they put ragdoll, even though it's been unnecessary up to this point in the video game.
[343:05.19]You know what I mean?
[343:05.69]Like, there was no need for ragdoll.
[343:08.05]We haven't used it in five and a half hours.
[343:10.55]Okay, I'm covering fire.
[343:11.92]Go.
[343:17.03]Okay, now you get to do the same thing for me.
[343:18.31]Now I get to throw something!
[343:22.13]Throw and then I shoot it?
[343:25.73]Alright, throw it!
[343:28.03]Go!
[343:30.63]Good enough.
[343:32.43]Good.
[343:34.17]Not quite what I was playing, but I'll take it.
[343:37.43]Those guys are very dead.
[343:39.06]Yeah, they weren't even... They're so dead that they weren't even... The body of... Are they?
[343:42.82]Yeah, they're here.
[343:49.96]That actually was just Cain and Lynch 3, though.
[343:51.52]Yeah, it was.
[343:53.46]Cain and Lynch 2.
[343:54.12]There is no 3.
[343:54.50]Alright, here we go with the pool party.
[343:58.07]We're at the bad guy's pool party.
[343:59.99]We play 2.
[344:00.77]This is 3.
[344:02.89]You better believe it.
[344:03.51]I thought that was you.
[344:10.14]I'm flanking.
[344:11.12]One hit and I'm dead.
[344:14.56]Nice work.
[344:23.33]Got him.
[344:23.97]It's a very inefficient gun, but it is more fun.
[344:26.65]Keep Mockupy.
[344:27.37]I got this.
[344:27.83]Give me some cover fire.
[344:35.07]Nice job.
[344:45.37]I got this guy.
[344:46.72]No, you got him.
[344:47.32]Nice job.
[344:48.26]Lot of bullets.
[344:49.44]There is a melee.
[344:50.97]There is?
[344:51.67]Like a gun push?
[344:52.69]It's R2.
[344:53.81]It is an instant kill, and yes, it is also as goofy as you think it is.
[344:58.62]One, two, three.
[344:59.58]Let's go.
[345:05.42]No, not the museum.
[345:06.32]So is this a... Scarface?
[345:07.78]It's Scarface right here.
[345:23.19]Killing his own men.
[345:24.29]He actually is.
[345:30.57]They are doing cartwheels.
[345:31.99]Are you covering me?
[345:35.21]Whoa!
[345:39.11]Except in Scarface, he didn't have a grenade launcher.
[345:42.98]Did he?
[345:44.28]Did he have a grenade launcher in Scarface?
[345:46.92]No, he didn't.
[345:48.44]He had a machine gun.
[345:49.90]Yeah, he had a machine gun.
[345:57.49]Why is he just rolling back and forth?
[345:59.35]I'm not sure what's harder for me.
[346:01.29]Bouncing in the chair or shooting the gun.
[346:04.33]You know, I'm not sure what's harder for me at this point.
[346:16.49]Keep trying, keep trying.
[346:19.85]Nice melee.
[346:21.53]You know, two points for that.
[346:22.73]Now we gotta do this segment again.
[346:24.24]Yeah, we're fine.
[346:25.08]Everything's fine.
[346:34.67]Fuck your head up.
[346:41.19]This submachine gun does no damage whatsoever.
[346:47.52]Five hit markers?
[346:51.02]Don't even get a killstreak?
[346:52.52]What just happened?
[346:53.12]Are you alright?
[346:54.00]I got exploded.
[346:54.48]Yeah, I'm okay.
[346:55.14]Oh, fuck.
[346:56.12]I gotta move.
[346:57.88]Get down.
[347:09.23]I love how you're eating the grenade.
[347:10.09]Moving up.
[347:11.75]Straight up top.
[347:12.09]Need cover.
[347:13.36]Need ammo.
[347:14.48]Where is he shooting from?
[347:15.74]Oh.
[347:21.24]Really?
[347:21.58]That worked?
[347:24.42]Why would you do that?
[347:25.25]You would have just killed us all.
[347:27.93]Everybody dies if you do that.
[347:31.57]Chase sequence.
[347:33.37]No.
[347:33.65]Pick up the grenade launcher, man.
[347:35.31]Turn this guy into a... He's gonna push the self-destruct button.
[347:37.58]Roast marshmallow.
[347:38.32]Is this Harvey?
[347:39.79]That's Harvey.
[347:40.59]It is?
[347:41.63]Yeah.
[347:42.75]This is the guy.
[347:43.96]Oh.
[347:47.22]Now he's a Bond villain.
[347:48.06]Don't even think about it.
[347:49.52]Slide it over.
[347:50.18]I thought this was just some henchman.
[347:54.38]He's got the golden gun, man.
[347:55.58]He's wearing the golden suit.
[347:58.54]Here you go.
[348:01.34]Now we're gonna make a decision.
[348:02.60]Okay, I'm gonna lie.
[348:03.73]I'm not gonna lie here.
[348:04.59]That was perfect.
[348:07.31]Right to the edge of the table.
[348:08.60]How are we supposed to decide this?
[348:10.16]We don't even know.
[348:10.84]We don't have anything to go on, do we?
[348:13.17]Vincent approaches.
[348:14.23]Leo confronts.
[348:15.13]I mean, what do we have?
[348:16.11]We have nothing to go on, so we may as well let Chad pick because there's really no bias here.
[348:20.05]Let's let Chad pick this one.
[348:21.91]This is probably the last choice.
[348:24.25]This is probably the end of the game.
[348:25.95]Yeah.
[348:26.09]All right.
[348:28.29]Leo or Vincent?
[348:30.09]Who gets to choose?
[348:34.47]Leo?
[348:36.01]I don't care either way.
[348:37.31]Vincent.
[348:40.63]You can throw that into your chat room if you get a moment.
[348:46.19]All right.
[348:47.03]Final decision probably of the night.
[348:49.85]Take a look.
[348:56.24]Ooh, this is close.
[348:58.26]This is close.
[349:01.46]Let's start it off.
[349:03.87]He's moving towards Leo, but it's still 54-46.
[349:07.23]I mean, this is like... These are election numbers right here.
[349:10.73]Yeah.
[349:11.01]It's too close to call.
[349:18.74]Uh-oh.
[349:19.16]Resurgence, maybe.
[349:21.50]You gonna see a run-up from Vincent here?
[349:22.82]No?
[349:23.36]Nah.
[349:23.80]Yeah.
[349:24.38]He went up to 48.
[349:25.14]Seeing a Vincent return.
[349:29.20]There's a 4% differential here.
[349:32.67]We need more votes.
[349:35.91]Yeah, forget about, like, the fucking presidential elections and shit.
[349:38.39]Who cares?
[349:38.87]Vote for this.
[349:39.33]This is more important.
[349:41.66]Like, midterms are coming up.
[349:42.66]Like, if you're going to cast one vote this year, cast it here.
[349:46.48]I mean, Leo is narrowly winning.
[349:53.41]But it went down to a 3... Oh, 2% differential now.
[349:57.37]It is, like, 15 votes apart.
[349:58.35]Like, 20 votes apart.
[350:02.89]Alright, we're gonna have to close it though.
[350:04.59]We have to close it.
[350:06.41]Look, this is gonna... You know that... What's that Futurama YouTube video that's been even on likes and dislikes for like seven or ten years?
[350:13.43]Oh, the neutral video.
[350:15.35]Now it actually is neutral because now we can't close it.
[350:17.16]Now it actually is neutral.
[350:19.06]It's 50-50 right now.
[350:20.96]That's kind of unbelievable.
[350:25.26]Wow.
[350:27.94]It's catching up.
[350:31.32]Wow.
[350:33.30]This is like a five point difference.
[350:37.58]It's even.
[350:38.18]Exactly even.
[350:42.28]I honestly didn't expect this.
[350:45.08]No, I thought people were going to pick something that they already knew, potentially.
[350:47.96]Alright, we're going to have to do like a countdown.
[350:50.49]Yeah, whatever it is at that time.
[350:52.07]Whichever one is ahead when we count down is the one we're going to do.
[350:55.21]Yeah.
[350:56.19]If you're sitting there and you're not... Let's put it in chat one more time because we're going to do a ten second countdown here.
[351:01.51]Put it in chat one more time.
[351:08.16]This is it.
[351:10.58]Count it down.
[351:11.00]We got 10 seconds.
[351:11.62]10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[351:15.12]I can't even.
[351:18.48]Leo wins at the last second, I think.
[351:24.25]Oh, God damn it.
[351:24.95]They're still both dead.
[351:25.75]No, it's Vincent now.
[351:26.25]No, we can't.
[351:26.59]Yeah.
[351:38.12]God damn it.
[351:40.06]Just take a screenshot.
[351:43.04]Alright, now it is closing in 10 seconds.
[351:45.00]Regardless of what it is.
[351:45.75]Whatever it is in 10 seconds from right now.
[351:48.45]10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
[351:55.51]Vincent wins.
[351:56.19]Pick it.
[351:56.51]Vincent wins?
[351:57.11]Choose it.
[351:58.07]Okay.
[352:01.77]That was close.
[352:05.84]Unbelievable.
[352:14.84]Vincent's still winning, by the way, just in case anyone thought it was rigged.
[352:17.98]Vincent's still ahead.
[352:19.44]Yeah, they had the choice.
[352:22.52]Shut the fuck up.
[352:23.54]One more word from you and I'll put a bullet in your face.
[352:26.10]Wait, wait, wait.
[352:28.26]Leo.
[352:28.58]Uh-oh.
[352:30.20]I still got it.
[352:31.70]That's what you're here for, right?
[352:33.28]The diamond.
[352:34.40]It's all yours.
[352:35.56]It's in the safe.
[352:36.58]Over there, you can take it.
[352:38.46]Yeah, remember that big fat diamond from earlier that he murdered the guy over?
[352:41.55]Get up.
[352:42.63]Go.
[352:43.55]Oh, yeah.
[352:46.43]Are we gonna get a bunch of fun options on how to kill this guy?
[352:52.95]Are we gonna be able to put him through like a meat grinder or something?
[353:06.46]Uh-oh, what's in there?
[353:07.86]Another gun?
[353:10.68]Watch that hand!
[353:16.77]Gun?
[353:21.17]Oh no.
[353:22.09]Oh god.
[353:23.61]Alright, which way do you want me to go?
[353:27.76]I want you to move to your... to my... Hold on.
[353:33.68]What are you doing?
[353:35.24]Are you inching him over towards the ticket booth?
[353:38.88]Now's your chance.
[353:42.70]Now's your chance.
[353:51.49]He's still standing?
[353:52.45]Get ready.
[354:00.20]Paint him, paint his whole body.
[354:01.46]Oh.
[354:04.19]Oh my God.
[354:04.83]That was crazy.
[354:09.17]I missed like twice.
[354:11.69]I know, I would not be safe.
[354:14.91]With you, like, shooting over my shoulder.
[354:17.79]That was very dangerous and irresponsible at best.
[354:21.49]More men?
[354:21.99]No, we gotta get the safe.
[354:24.48]We already got it, didn't we?
[354:25.18]There's a diamond.
[354:27.80]Maybe I still have the diamond in my pocket.
[354:30.40]Guys, guys, guys.
[354:31.36]Bikes, bikes, bikes, bikes, bikes, bikes.
[354:33.24]No way.
[354:33.78]Yep.
[354:34.74]Oh, they gave it to us right at the end of the game.
[354:37.36]Of course they did.
[354:38.22]No cutscene.
[354:38.74]Bikes.
[354:39.98]Please let us have the bikes.
[354:45.11]Don't do it.
[354:48.22]Let this be a recommend stamp.
[354:52.70]Don't do it.
[354:54.64]Don't do it.
[354:56.80]Give me that bike.
[355:00.52]It's loading something big.
[355:02.62]Come on.
[355:03.02]Could be a big old outdoor sequence.
[355:05.26]Come on, do it.
[355:08.06]And it looks promising.
[355:09.30]It does.
[355:09.56]Let's keep going.
[355:11.18]We gotta find Emily.
[355:14.54]Yep.
[355:14.74]Okay, you got a stamp of approval for this game.
[355:16.34]Alright, you go.
[355:19.45]You pick a direction, I'll pick the other one.
[355:24.45]Oh my god.
[355:27.51]Well, I just... Holy shit, I went the wrong way.
[355:31.57]Somehow I'm alive.
[355:39.94]Are you okay back there?
[355:41.66]Not really.
[355:44.93]How did we just cross paths?
[355:50.46]We just drove by each other.
[355:52.52]Yeah, you've got like the cinematic view.
[356:01.47]What a jump!
[356:03.13]He can't shoot?
[356:03.61]What a jump.
[356:04.11]He's like impressed with himself.
[356:05.75]Behind you, Vincent.
[356:07.03]Watch out!
[356:13.67]You gonna get us killed?
[356:14.65]No, I'm good.
[356:17.93]I'm just taking up a lot.
[356:18.83]We got... We got Carfax on.
[356:21.96]No, Kevlar.
[356:23.50]We got the door.
[356:24.20]We got the Carfax.
[356:25.14]Show him the Carfax.
[356:33.67]Holy shit.
[356:35.37]I can't... How do I control this bike like this?
[356:41.48]Wow.
[356:42.12]I was at my cinematic finale jump, too.
[356:44.89]Like, I was just going over the ramp.
[356:48.51]I died from the bullets.
[356:49.51]I was taking bullets in the back the whole time.
[356:52.17]We're fine.
[356:58.44]That went differently than I remembered.
[357:00.02]Yeah, it did.
[357:03.55]What the fuck, dude?
[357:04.67]Come on.
[357:05.65]Seriously.
[357:07.73]I had a goddamn log in the fucking road.
[357:10.07]We're supposed to do it where we both go off the ramp at the same time.
[357:13.49]Listen, we're both going to go off the fucking ramp at the same time, all right?
[357:16.24]All right, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[357:20.90]All right, stay on the road.
[357:22.90]We're on a different road.
[357:23.74]They timed it perfectly, though.
[357:30.22]See, we did it.
[357:39.20]Wow.
[357:40.88]I can't fall out of a jeep.
[357:44.92]That was cool.
[357:45.86]That's pretty awesome.
[357:52.15]Yeah.
[357:53.21]Did you see that?
[357:57.74]They're so impressed with themselves.
[358:01.24]You're getting lit up.
[358:02.58]I know.
[358:02.88]I'm not even doing anything wrong.
[358:06.50]Well, you are like running all off the bridge.
[358:08.76]Well, now I am because I'm getting fucking tracer bullets shot at me.
[358:12.28]Here comes the helicopter.
[358:18.73]Hi.
[358:20.57]Well, okay.
[358:21.41]I just got... Alright.
[358:22.23]I just got hit by a fucking missile, okay?
[358:24.47]Don't be mad at me for this one.
[358:32.28]What are you supposed to do?
[358:33.08]Just... Oh my lord.
[358:36.12]I don't think it's us taking... Okay, we actually are getting hit by a missile now.
[358:41.32]Yeah, we're getting hit by them, but I think as long as... Where am I?
[358:48.61]I don't... I feel like I just turned around.
[358:52.81]Where did I go?
[358:53.53]Oh, shit!
[358:56.08]Shit!
[358:58.86]I'm so confused at what happened.
[359:00.25]I feel like I'm driving around on a Mario Kart track.
[359:02.97]I'm coming!
[359:03.67]I'm coming!
[359:03.97]I'm coming!
[359:09.90]Get on!
[359:12.64]Your dream is coming true!
[359:14.14]We get to drive!
[359:15.92]Shoot it!
[359:16.51]Oh my god.
[359:27.77]Hey, where do they come from?
[359:30.48]Who cares?
[359:36.56]Dude, what a sequence.
[359:38.18]These are the most... Healthy trucks.
[359:42.35]They're right behind us now.
[359:44.99]We gotta get on the plane.
[359:50.75]That's our escape route.
[359:52.54]There we go.
[359:53.44]Now we're talking.
[359:54.00]Alright.
[359:54.36]We should be able to pull up right to the side, right?
[360:01.92]We need to do something here?
[360:04.64]Hey.
[360:05.81]Watch it.
[360:06.41]Alright, watch your head.
[360:09.05]You have to jump to the plane.
[360:12.47]Right?
[360:12.69]You're not close enough.
[360:13.49]What do you mean you're not close enough?
[360:14.47]Yes, we are.
[360:14.91]It's on the other side.
[360:15.81]It's on the right side.
[360:16.71]You're on the left.
[360:18.99]Ah, shit.
[360:22.73]Well, that's it.
[360:23.63]Looks like we're going to be living in Mexico.
[360:25.85]Looks like we're staying here for a while.
[360:27.99]Oops.
[360:32.67]It's all right.
[360:33.59]No big deal.
[360:35.25]Wrong side.
[360:36.05]Oh, come on.
[360:37.59]In 2018, you got a minivan opens from both sides automatically, by the way.
[360:42.70]That seems to be the last of them.
[360:44.92]Get closer to the plane.
[360:46.42]Hurry up.
[360:47.24]Get in.
[360:47.66]Get on.
[360:51.51]Now I have to do the same thing.
[360:53.73]No, it's putting me on the other side.
[360:56.03]Why am I standing on the bike?
[360:58.73]This isn't a show.
[361:01.65]Come on, man.
[361:05.03]That's what I'm talking about.
[361:08.01]At the last second.
[361:11.92]Pretend that one was uninterrupted one sequence.
[361:15.69]Yeah, I'm fine.
[361:16.99]We didn't lose at the very last possible moment.
[361:19.99]Great flying.
[361:20.95]You guys are crazy.
[361:22.59]Vincent, you're going to have to pay me triple for this.
[361:24.82]I got it.
[361:28.26]Vincent, you're not going to hear me say this often, but thanks.
[361:33.62]You too, Leo.
[361:35.28]That's the first handshake we've had all day.
[361:37.36]Even when we met the first time.
[361:40.12]I'm going to write that letter to Carol.
[361:43.20]That's a great idea.
[361:48.50]It's a good ending, right?
[361:59.41]What a good guy, you know?
[362:03.47]Just got done murdering about a hundred people.
[362:07.53]Slaughtering them, really.
[362:09.07]So is that it?
[362:09.93]Time to write a love letter.
[362:21.89]I guess we'll find out.
[362:23.49]There's you writing a letter.
[362:26.93]What does it say?
[362:27.45]I can't read.
[362:30.65]I don't know.
[362:32.15]I'm nine years old.
[362:35.39]You are writing it with a dirty crayon.
[362:43.28]How are we doing?
[362:44.28]We should be landing in ten minutes.
[362:46.40]Okay.
[362:47.28]What's Leo up to?
[362:49.16]Sleeping.
[362:50.08]About time to wake him up then.
[362:52.27]Yeah.
[362:54.13]Are you okay, Vincent?
[362:55.81]Yeah.
[362:56.93]You sure?
[362:57.37]Yeah, I'm fine.
[363:02.78]Leo.
[363:03.34]What?
[363:04.56]I... Yeah.
[363:06.60]We there yet?
[363:07.86]Yeah.
[363:09.20]Almost.
[363:09.56]They're playing kind of scary music right now.
[363:20.93]Like, it can't be that easy, you know?
[363:24.01]Yeah.
[363:39.44]Happy birthday, right?
[363:42.26]Surprise.
[363:47.14]She turned us in.
[363:47.86]Stop pointing at us.
[363:49.46]And not at her.
[363:53.55]Ghostbusters showing up the like this this still could be a surprise birthday party No, we already popped out of the cake earlier now one of us is one of us is a rat Well, it's not me, and it's not you it's not me There's got to be her she's the only one everybody stand down I
[364:23.41]Let's see what Commissioner Gordon has to say.
[364:29.72]He's going to shake one of our hands and be like, good work, Lieutenant.
[364:35.16]Which one's the Lieutenant?
[364:52.47]Ooh.
[364:57.92]How'd that get there?
[364:59.08]Good job, Vincent.
[365:00.62]Yeah, you're the plant.
[365:03.50]You were caught the whole time.
[365:06.36]I'm sorry, Leo.
[365:09.84]Whoa!
[365:12.56]What a twist.
[365:13.72]Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him.
[365:15.79]This is where I get to escape now, right?
[365:18.59]This is a flash forward.
[365:19.93]You had a dream about this before we got off the plane.
[365:32.93]Wait, so you were like, you're going to be there with binoculars as a cop watching this.
[365:55.29]So then why were we actually getting shot at by police?
[365:59.11]If you were police?
[366:00.87]Well, one has to assume that they didn't know.
[366:04.59]So we're going ultra deep right here.
[366:05.97]We're going to find out.
[366:07.35]This is the end of the game.
[366:08.15]We'll know in a second.
[366:17.66]It's all there.
[366:18.68]Count it.
[366:26.33]You're a bad friend.
[366:28.69]Listen.
[366:29.03]This is really how it went down.
[366:30.11]You're the one that did the shooting.
[366:33.09]And I was Harvey.
[366:36.19]Why was...
[366:56.72]Pleasure doing business with you guys.
[366:58.68]You too.
[366:59.79]All right.
[367:00.65]He's got it.
[367:01.67]Finally.
[367:02.13]What the fuck are you doing?
[367:07.09]Shit!
[367:07.43]Shots fired!
[367:07.91]Shots fired!
[367:08.66]Go, go, go!
[367:09.74]Secure the area!
[367:10.76]Move in!
[367:24.67]Oh no, Gary!
[367:25.11]Gary!
[367:25.79]This was his real partner.
[367:28.05]So I'm the bad guy.
[367:29.41]So I'm the bad guy.
[367:32.17]But it was Harvey.
[367:33.19]No, I know Harvey killed him.
[367:37.11]That's why I wanted to kill Harvey.
[367:42.38]Because he killed my partner.
[367:44.48]But I was friends with Harvey.
[367:54.50]Where's the Black Orlov?
[367:57.68]What are you, deaf?
[368:02.73]Well, you think you're funny, don't you?
[368:07.41]What, you think you can just go and sell it on the street corner?
[368:09.61]What are you, stupid?
[368:10.41]Are you that stupid?
[368:19.16]That was his brother.
[368:19.96]Oh, okay.
[368:20.62]It's all gonna rain down on you hard.
[368:23.64]You got it?
[368:24.18]Spoilers.
[368:26.49]Just kidding.
[368:28.19]You're gonna have to talk at some point.
[368:32.31]He's not gonna say a word.
[368:33.53]You're gonna have to go to jail with him.
[368:36.21]I know.
[368:37.66]There's only one option now.
[368:40.46]I'll get someone on it.
[368:43.56]James, if you want Harvey and the Black Orlov, this is the only way.
[368:49.92]Just put me in a cell next to him.
[368:51.32]You're too close to this, Vincent.
[368:55.10]You better sit this one out.
[368:56.40]Just put me in a cell next to him.
[368:57.60]Gary was my brother.
[368:59.43]My flesh and blood.
[369:01.31]And he's dead because of me.
[369:03.07]What information did you provide that led us to Harvey?
[369:06.25]I need to do this, and you know it.
[369:10.02]Just make it happen, James.
[369:12.32]We played basketball with my son.
[369:14.78]I mean, that's true, but there was something.
[369:18.38]I provided the plane.
[369:19.80]Yeah, you provided the plane.
[369:23.07]I provided the funny commentary.
[369:24.75]Like, my guy provided, like, the... Remember he, like, fucked up?
[369:27.95]Leo knew Rex.
[369:29.07]Who's Rex?
[369:29.89]Why would we let this happen here?
[369:34.54]Alright, what am I going to do with you?
[369:35.68]What am I going to do with you?
[369:36.76]Let me think about this for a second.
[369:37.76]Let me turn my back to the audience.
[369:39.88]I wonder what I'm going to do about this.
[369:41.99]They have at least five seconds to shoot me in the back right now.
[369:44.75]Let me think.
[369:47.01]Okay, I think I thought about what I want to do.
[369:49.87]Yeah!
[369:50.05]Come on!
[369:52.63]You were going to murder me.
[370:00.06]Can I get in the Ecto-1 from Ghostbusters?
[370:04.28]That was my turn to drive.
[370:07.58]Get out of there.
[370:10.72]Can you drive me?
[370:11.54]Oh, okay.
[370:12.08]And that led us to Leo.
[370:23.11]Hold on, does this game keep going?
[370:25.37]I have to steer the car?
[370:45.30]Stop the car and let's talk this through.
[370:47.68]You like this?
[370:49.16]Is this scary to you?
[370:50.16]The only right thing, huh?
[370:51.56]The only right thing here is me fighting this guy.
[370:55.25]Do I just drive in a straight line?
[370:57.59]Yeah, we do have dialogue choices for each other, that's right.
[371:00.51]I'm really sorry for everything.
[371:02.53]Please stop the car.
[371:04.21]Sorry!
[371:05.43]Sorry!
[371:06.19]I can't believe you, you fucking rat!
[371:08.69]I'm pretty sure this part is on rails.
[371:10.41]You're trying to ruin the end of the whole game.
[371:14.96]It's over.
[371:15.48]I don't think I can do anything.
[371:16.44]The entire police force is after you.
[371:18.47]There's no way out of this.
[371:20.41]I swear, Vincent, one more word and I'll put a bullet right through your forehead.
[371:25.13]Uh-oh, here it comes.
[371:25.97]Here comes the climax.
[371:26.97]You've been waiting for this.
[371:37.56]I said I was sorry.
[371:41.86]I'm going to get my window open first.
[371:46.63]Are we underwater?
[371:47.31]Now we are.
[371:49.53]I just made it worse.
[371:54.21]Oh, God.
[371:54.71]We both have to wrestle for the gun.
[371:56.34]Oh, no.
[372:00.88]Go, go, go, go, go.
[372:03.04]Oh, this is fucking cool.
[372:09.34]No, no, no, no.
[372:10.62]Oh, my God.
[372:11.10]I'm terrible.
[372:15.70]I got it to work, even though I fucked it up.
[372:18.94]You have to chase me now.
[372:22.54]Wow, what a great pilot.
[372:23.82]Helicopter comes back to save the day.
[372:25.57]Got my durability here.
[372:29.07]Alright, now we are playing against each other.
[372:30.85]This is fucking incredible.
[372:33.39]This is fucking awesome.
[372:40.81]Now it's a PvP 1v1 game.
[372:47.11]Oh my god.
[372:48.00]Hey there, buddy!
[372:48.82]Yeah, how you doing?
[372:49.42]Didn't think you could see somebody this erratic, did ya?
[372:52.82]What was that?
[373:02.67]What are you doing?
[373:03.57]Yeah, sorry!
[373:04.77]Having a little bit of trouble with that aim, I think!
[373:10.87]Oh yeah?
[373:12.13]How's that working out for you now?
[373:17.09]Ooh.
[373:18.61]Complaining about the engine, are we?
[373:22.46]Come on, it's gotta make it to Vegas.
[373:29.36]Shit.
[373:30.54]No more durability.
[373:34.92]Now you're mine.
[373:36.30]I gotta jump to go over.
[373:39.39]Go, go.
[373:40.51]What happened?
[373:40.95]Whoopsie.
[373:41.69]What happened to me?
[373:42.91]What happened?
[373:43.37]I don't know.
[373:44.41]I don't know, but you're okay now.
[373:57.93]Did I just transform in the middle of the air?
[374:04.14]I made it up.
[374:09.56]The car turned into a plane.
[374:12.24]He's dead.
[374:13.02]There's no way he could have survived that.
[374:23.43]Yeah, you didn't know I had a 500-billion-dollar plane, boat, car.
[374:28.68]Time to hunt the fugitive.
[374:34.60]We're just playing face-off.
[374:39.02]Leo, remember the last six hours, man?
[374:41.62]It doesn't have to go down like this.
[374:43.94]I thought we were buds.
[374:45.72]You told me to write a letter to my wife.
[374:48.61]I did.
[374:50.74]Why is it two of you?
[374:51.33]You got a new co-op partner.
[374:52.35]Who just hot-seated you?
[374:55.99]I match made.
[374:57.17]That's bullshit.
[374:57.73]Where's my couch co-op hot seat?
[374:59.69]I'll go this way.
[375:01.23]Oh, I know what's coming.
[375:06.32]I know what's coming.
[375:19.64]That's what I would have done.
[375:22.30]Hey, listen, Jeremy, are we friends?
[375:23.88]Are we frenemies?
[375:26.40]You have to make that decision yourself.
[375:49.29]Please stop this.
[375:50.67]How's it feel to stab someone in the back?
[375:53.05]I know you're disappointed, but Harvey killed my brother.
[375:56.64]I had no choice.
[375:57.88]I can't fucking believe this.
[375:59.94]I'll talk to the captain.
[376:01.48]We'll reduce your sentence.
[376:03.08]My sentence?
[376:04.30]You're a dead man, you piece of shit.
[376:06.24]What about your son, Alex?
[376:08.38]Shut the fuck up.
[376:09.84]Don't you mention his name.
[376:10.54]I play basketball with him.
[376:11.53]You don't get to mention his name.
[376:13.93]You hear that, you piece of shit?
[376:15.67]You're a dead man!
[376:17.13]You piece of shit!
[376:18.85]Time for us to have a 1v1 third person.
[376:21.45]Look at this.
[376:22.47]Oh no.
[376:24.09]Wow.
[376:26.33]Alright, this is... Okay, we're gonna have to get some extra points here for the end of the game.
[376:31.71]Yeah, definitely.
[376:33.47]Absolutely, at least a couple extra points.
[376:35.51]Gotta find him.
[376:36.57]Can't let him get away.
[376:47.32]I wonder where that pig is hiding.
[376:49.26]I see you, mission.
[376:50.46]You can't hide from me.
[376:52.98]He's in debt.
[376:57.63]Give up, Leo.
[376:58.97]This won't end well.
[377:11.53]Alright, that's a wall.
[377:12.77]Okay.
[377:13.41]I love how it actually encourages screen looking too, like classic co-op games.
[377:33.94]I don't think so.
[377:34.70]I know where you are.
[377:35.44]I know where you are too.
[377:37.66]Yeah, but who's got the better spot?
[377:44.05]Oh, these scouts suck.
[377:51.29]I can't see!
[377:52.63]My head's in the way!
[378:03.57]Don't get in the way, I'm so bad at- I'm so fucking bad at shooting with an analog.
[378:08.01]That's right!
[378:08.87]Run!
[378:10.24]God damn it.
[378:13.11]You may as well spray peanut butter all over my eyes.
[378:25.31]Get the clock.
[378:25.77]I can't even, like, I can't even argue.
[378:47.50]Dude, I can't use this.
[378:49.30]You just stood still and let me have it though.
[378:51.88]I would rather you just kill me.
[378:53.40]Drop it.
[378:54.05]Can I turn the gun on myself?
[378:58.23]I don't want to do this, Leo.
[379:00.61]I don't want to do this.
[379:04.43]Fucking disgust me, you pig.
[379:08.03]I just can't use a controller and aim.
[379:10.81]It's not fucking possible for me.
[379:22.24]Wow.
[379:24.12]I tried to spare you.
[379:25.08]I've done so much for you.
[379:32.25]It's not over.
[379:32.85]I'm supposed to find the grenade, the secret grenade.
[379:38.58]Where do you even...
[379:47.18]The fuck just happened?
[379:48.04]Wait, what?!
[379:49.14]Get, uh, takedown!
[379:51.28]Wait, wha- I was just shooting you, I was lighting you up with bullets!
[379:56.15]Off the top rope!
[380:10.85]You have, like, most of your health.
[380:12.13]I d- I d- I think I probably shot you with three bullets this whole time.
[380:16.45]What's going on here?
[380:16.97]I'm tired though.
[380:17.59]I'm old.
[380:18.47]What is happening here?
[380:21.23]Why are you holding that?
[380:28.57]I had to wind it up.
[380:30.62]That was a charge up.
[380:32.68]Wait, do I have to do this now to you too?
[380:34.86]Oh, look at how much damage I'm going to do to you.
[380:39.14]Yeah, but I'm like 45.
[380:40.22]I'm really tired, you know?
[380:41.84]It's been a long day.
[380:43.31]Thinking about my baby.
[380:45.45]I'm my newborn child.
[380:48.13]My first child.
[380:49.19]Look at my health.
[380:49.93]What a fucking joke.
[380:56.55]Who's doing that?
[380:57.15]Okay, that's you.
[380:58.59]I was seeing if I could do like a half-strength one.
[381:06.57]I played basketball with your son.
[381:08.91]We sat on a swing together.
[381:11.76]We pulled clock strings together, remember?
[381:14.74]Open the secret door.
[381:15.62]Yeah, what the fuck?
[381:18.22]I remember the secret door.
[381:19.48]I beat you in Connect Four.
[381:26.80]Who's this?
[381:27.94]Oh, that's your wife.
[381:29.64]Yeah, this was when we first met, when all I had was a mustache.
[381:34.88]Before I grew the rest of the goatee.
[381:37.60]Alright, give me the knee.
[381:45.41]I'm dead on the next one.
[381:50.30]What if I kill you faster than you can finish?
[381:52.62]I know.
[381:53.38]I can't even remember my past.
[381:57.56]I can't even remember.
[381:59.30]I got to remember one scene with my son.
[382:01.14]Uh-oh.
[382:13.84]See, I can't let this happen because Jerm is gonna pull the trigger on me if he gets a chance.
[382:17.03]It's gonna happen.
[382:17.41]You just wait a fucking second here.
[382:30.00]Hey, how was arm wrestling earlier, bud?
[382:31.58]Remember arm wrestling?
[382:32.08]It doesn't even fucking matter!
[382:40.89]I'm wearing a skateboard shirt.
[382:42.97]You gotta shoot me in the face.
[382:44.29]Shoot me in the face at least.
[382:51.52]I'm still alive.
[382:58.34]I didn't die yet.
[383:01.46]You're making it real hard on me though.
[383:13.61]With the other guy that you shot in the knee, he survived.
[383:17.59]You can too.
[383:20.86]What, he's pushing buttons now?
[383:23.74]Oh no.
[383:28.25]Just let me go with dignity or some fucking dub line.
[383:40.09]Are you actually dying?
[383:41.43]I don't know.
[383:41.81]Wait, can I... Oh, you can move.
[383:43.13]I didn't have any other choice.
[383:45.27]Wait, I can hold your hand.
[383:51.79]Chill bumps.
[383:53.31]Now you gotta spin around really for the bastard, just like, so long, King Bowser, way off the cliff.
[384:04.06]That just is me.
[384:08.02]Oh no, you're actually dead?
[384:10.24]No Was there another what I didn't actually want to kill you but uh survival of the fittest, you know, you wouldn't quit What a game I don't want to be the one to tell Alex I
[384:39.04]Uh-oh, now you have to see, did I get the bad ending or did you?
[384:41.84]Because now you have to tell my family.
[384:46.62]Look, the game told me to aim.
[384:48.63]Okay, what do you want?
[384:50.43]Just follow in orders.
[384:51.33]Oh, when I use thumbsticks, you may as well have a four-year-old play the game.
[384:55.07]That's pretty much how it goes.
[385:10.24]Hi.
[385:12.00]Can I come in?
[385:13.36]Sure.
[385:14.99]I shot your husband, but maybe didn't have to.
[385:18.55]Hey, Alex.
[385:21.75]I killed your dad.
[385:23.37]Hey, you want to go out back?
[385:24.37]I'll dunk on you.
[385:25.21]Linda, we need to talk.
[385:28.76]Use a mouse next time?
[385:29.68]We're on PlayStation 4.
[385:32.00]There's no option for that.
[385:33.08]Alex, why don't you go out and play some ball?
[385:37.59]Hey, play with me.
[385:38.05]You want to play, man?
[385:38.71]It's about Leo.
[385:39.15]What about him?
[386:05.72]That's it.
[386:10.07]But we got revenge.
[386:27.66]Why did you do that?
[386:29.58]How could you do that?
[386:30.24]Did you know he was using a controller?
[386:32.60]He's not good with a controller.
[386:38.87]I feel bad.
[386:39.61]Didn't you watch his TF2 videos when he used to be good?
[386:44.09]Get out!
[386:51.65]No, what the fuck?
[386:53.39]How could he?
[386:54.83]I didn't want to leave a widow.
[386:56.23]Why was he just so bad at the game?
[386:57.79]If only he just had a mouse and he was playing Team Fortress.
[387:04.62]I'm like ruining the ending.
[387:05.76]I'm sorry.
[387:08.32]Aww.
[387:15.85]Alright, now it cuts to you, like, sprinting.
[387:17.35]You have, like, a sprint sequence.
[387:19.01]Where you, like, get the fuck out of there.
[387:34.61]Want the good ending.
[387:35.77]We should've just stayed in those old people's houses for the rest of the game.
[387:41.09]And just played, like, the...
[387:46.16]Piano And the banjo I'm a changed man now I shaved Cleaned myself up

[388:36.56]What's this?
[388:37.12]It's my resignation from the Bureau.
[388:43.12]It's over, Carol.
[388:43.98]I'm out.
[388:48.36]Please, just give me one more chance.
[388:54.54]Got to be at least one good thing that comes out of this ending.

[389:56.14]You gonna come visit my grave now?
[389:57.26]Listen, we played Connect Four together.

[390:23.07]1936.

[390:26.52]Holy shit, he was like 81.
[390:30.86]Interesting.
[390:33.54]Wait, what?
[390:34.26]Yeah, he was like 81.
[390:38.70]Because this is set in modern day?
[390:55.31]At least he's wearing jeans like his dad.
[390:57.39]Hey, look at that.
[391:19.47]There it is.
[391:21.93]Almost exactly a six hour game.
[391:24.68]But that's what's doing all of the goofs.
[391:29.88]Now, the real question is, was it even possible not to shoot you?
[391:34.92]No.
[391:35.88]One of us has to.
[391:36.78]It's just whoever wins the 1v1.
[391:39.16]That's the ending you get.
[391:40.40]There's no good ending.
[391:42.60]It's just 1v1, just fuck around and kill each other, and whoever wins, that's the ending you get.
[391:50.91]At least there's like a little bit of replayability.
[391:53.49]Like be the other character, do the other like, there's like five decisions in like the finale.
[392:02.73]What happens if you, if we go your way for taking out Harvey though?
[392:07.05]Does the death change?
[392:07.91]I'm not sure there's any changes in deaths.
[392:12.28]I mean like the way you kill him.
[392:14.22]Let's see.
[392:14.70]What happens if we skip this?
[392:15.54]Well, that happens.
[392:18.80]Uh-huh.
[392:20.11]I'm assuming there's no after the credits sequence.
[392:22.13]That was kind of a... It seemed like all the potential final knots were tied.
[392:28.13]Yeah, I don't think there was.
[392:29.41]I don't think they would give you... Maybe they would.
[392:32.11]I wonder if we can... Let's do this.
[392:33.62]Let's do chapter select.
[392:35.48]And let's just go and do the fight again.
[392:38.16]And let's just see the other ending.
[392:40.10]Okay.
[392:40.88]Might as well, right?
[392:41.46]We're here.
[392:42.18]Yeah, you're going to have to re-invite me, though.
[392:44.22]Yeah, that's fine.
[392:47.05]Get it on here.
[392:50.94]Are there more than two endings?
[392:52.46]Maybe they're not.
[392:54.20]That was a great game, though.
[392:55.42]Really, that was... Yeah, that was, you know, well worth it.
[392:59.14]You know, well worth my price of admission.
[393:01.06]I gotta tell you.
[393:01.90]Honestly, the fact that it's $30, and you can play this with someone... This is one of the games that when people only say they buy games if they get X number of hours per dollar, that I'm gonna be like, but then you couldn't have played this game.
[393:18.61]Yeah, you should get an invite there.
[393:20.18]All right, chapter select, which should put us here somewhere, right?
[393:29.27]Where do we want to start?
[393:30.11]Just like from the... Yeah, I have the demo version.
[393:34.61]Yeah, I have the trial.
[393:35.27]That's the whole point, guys.
[393:36.33]I have the trial version because EA, for some reason, allowed these developers to allow only one person to buy the game because you have to play it in co-op.
[393:47.22]Yeah, so only one person has to own the game.
[393:49.98]You can play through the entire thing if you don't own it with somebody that does own it.
[393:55.96]So, like, you can talk to your friend and each pay $15 and get the whole game.
[394:03.08]Yeah, no, I mean, okay, so here's what I have to say about this.
[394:07.81]This game, for the first, like, four or five hours...
[394:12.19]Was like... It was good.
[394:14.25]It was alright.
[394:15.29]I think it might have been a little slow in some places.
[394:18.65]Because they really ramp up the action.
[394:21.88]Like three, four, five hours after the game starts.
[394:25.70]But this end... I kind of like the pacing.
[394:27.50]But I mean, just the end.
[394:28.96]Just the end is worth the price of admission for sure.
[394:33.35]I like the whole... Set up with the prison stuff.
[394:37.57]Like...
[394:38.99]It kind of makes you earn the crescendo.
[394:41.67]You know, you have to earn the climax.
[394:42.97]You can't just... It would be stupid if it was balls to the wall from start to finish.
[394:47.97]But like they say, they save the best for last.
[394:50.42]And the best is... Well, the fact that you have to play against somebody.
[394:53.04]You versus your friend that you've been playing with for the last five hours.
[394:56.44]it turns it into like a pvp game and that that makes it interesting even though it's obviously not like you know the best gunplay far from it but it's just the idea of it is unique yeah a lot of the sequences were really well done too like about those chase sequences that a lot of moving parts going on those are really cool yeah I mean like if you identify every mechanic independently they're all janky but like put together as a whole
[395:22.29]Really good.
[395:23.49]It's 30 bucks.
[395:24.51]You and your buddy don't even need to both buy the damn game.
[395:27.31]This is straight up, like, yeah, recommend.
[395:30.41]Especially if your friend, like, obviously, if you've been here the whole time, you saw the whole game, you know what happens.
[395:37.75]But if you play with somebody else, and they don't know what happens, then that's interesting enough to get here and be like, oh, look at this!
[395:47.52]So how does this end if we both have full health?
[395:49.88]Um, I don't know.
[395:53.02]Maybe it just saves the state.
[395:56.05]How am I going to let you win?
[395:57.29]Are we trying to see the other ending?
[395:58.47]Is that what you're doing?
[396:00.03]Okay, hold on a minute.
[396:01.17]I didn't do that.
[396:02.63]Maybe we'll get to a point where we just... Okay, I think it just gave us the health that we would have had.
[396:10.35]You had a little bit more last time.
[396:12.85]Yeah.
[396:13.71]How can I avoid doing damage to you, though?
[396:16.47]I don't think you can.
[396:17.45]Maybe when we get to the tapping, maybe just don't do it.
[396:21.06]I mean, this is without a doubt the best co-op game that has come out in the last few years, at least.
[396:27.46]Like, purely co-op.
[396:29.91]How am I supposed to not hit you?
[396:32.83]I think you can, but remember, I have to get the gun.
[396:35.73]Even when you take my health down, we just have to get the gun.
[396:37.83]Oh, we have to get the gun.
[396:38.94]Yeah.
[396:40.51]So everything we're doing here, the whole fight, the guns and this, is leading up to... It's based on your health points.
[396:47.96]You just get a handicap to be able to do when you're crawling.
[396:52.16]So if I have like 50% health and you have 50% health, we'll be going at the same crawl speed.
[396:56.94]If I have like 30% health and you have 50% health, then I have to push faster.
[397:05.47]I think the biggest point in the game's favor is how many different places you go in such a short amount of time.
[397:11.79]They never leave you in one area for too long.
[397:16.60]You go from the prison to the escape to both players' backstories, chase sequences.
[397:24.04]Everything is constantly moving you to the next thing.
[397:38.05]I don't think there's a both live ending.
[397:40.91]I don't think you can try.
[397:42.37]I mean, when you get the gun, you can grab it and see what happens.
[397:46.25]But I doubt it.
[397:47.91]What happens if you both don't tap?
[397:49.09]It probably just makes you crawl.
[397:50.48]Does it?
[397:51.84]No, it doesn't.
[397:53.40]All right, well, let me just get there.
[397:57.18]Are you tapping right now?
[397:57.94]Yeah, I'm going to stop.
[398:01.98]You were really slow on low health.
[398:04.48]I know, you were just like such a slug.
[398:05.66]I was like guaranteed gonna win.
[398:07.40]Yeah, the only way this is possible... Are you coming as fast as you can, or no?
[398:10.32]No, no, no, no, no.
[398:11.40]Iobop, you better believe I was when we were fighting.
[398:14.78]That was like the hardest I've ever tried doing it.
[398:17.77]Okay, so... You have to aim.
[398:19.85]Like, I'm pretty sure you have to.
[398:22.31]Do you?
[398:23.37]Yeah, because it only unfreezes time if you aim.
[398:26.11]Yeah, I think this is just who dies.
[398:30.90]I mean, you can try not shooting and see if you can hold it there, but I'm pretty sure if you let go of left trigger, it's just going to reset, won't it?
[398:36.34]Yeah, it is.
[398:38.06]All right, well.
[398:44.71]Try missing.
[398:45.39]You can't move the... Yeah, you cannot move the reticle.
[398:48.60]All right, let's see how this plays out.
[399:06.16]I think it's safe to say that everything we expected from the E3 trailer last year is what we got.
[399:12.77]Yeah.
[399:13.59]For me at least.
[399:18.17]Yeah.
[399:19.07]It's different, right?
[399:19.83]Like the end of this game, regardless how you feel about the whole game, this was interesting.
[399:25.90]The last 45 minutes of the game was very interesting.
[399:34.20]Oh, you want me to give the letter.
[399:43.02]Germo winning is the baton.
[399:44.68]Give my letter to Carol.
[399:51.01]Yeah, this game has four difficulties of piano and banjo minigames.
[400:00.85]Yeah, those are fun.
[400:01.47]So much gameplay.
[400:02.03]It's a good theme song, too.
[400:10.05]This is a good theme song.
[400:11.83]Yeah, that's good.
[400:17.50]The wind just takes it away.
[400:18.92]Tearing her up in front of me, that's so awful.
[400:34.75]Yeah, you're gonna have to tell my wife with a newborn child.
[400:39.35]But I guess she won't care because we weren't together before anyway.
[400:57.01]All right, let's see.
[400:57.81]So wait, so now we just go... You're doing it in reverse.
[401:01.29]You're probably going to go talk to my family and then see yours.
[401:19.69]That beard.
[401:20.23]I thought it was you.
[401:22.72]I really just thought that was you getting out of the car.
[401:24.36]That's the kind of shirt you would wear.
[401:25.55]And he had facial hair.
[401:27.49]I was like, wait, huh?
[401:30.09]You cleaned up.
[401:30.83]You know you're a family man now.
[401:33.98]You almost got cold feet.
[401:35.24]Don't even do it.
[401:38.66]You're probably going to leave the letter.
[401:41.48]I don't want to spoil it.
[401:54.13]Well, that works.
[402:25.39]Carol, I just want to say that I'm so sorry.
[402:29.33]I'm sorry for the broken promises and not being there when you needed me.
[402:37.20]I'm sorry for no longer being the man you fell in love with.
[402:41.56]My biggest regrets are all the moments we didn't get to spend together.
[402:46.83]From now on, I don't want to miss a second together with you and our beautiful daughter.
[402:53.87]If you let me,
[402:55.65]I'll be the husband you once loved, and the father I know I can be.
[403:01.07]Yours forever, Vincent.
[403:06.94]Let's go visit my family.
[403:10.14]For a second, I thought we weren't even gonna get to hear or see what the letter was.
[403:14.33]Yeah.
[403:14.53]They made such a big deal out of it, I thought they were just gonna be like, oh, a letter.
[403:16.99]All right.
[403:18.75]I'll go in.
[403:20.15]That's the voice of the baby.
[403:23.31]Carol.
[403:25.64]Cabbage.
[403:26.90]Lettuce.
[403:28.16]Deli ham.
[403:29.68]American cheese.
[403:32.14]Chef Boyardee meatballs.
[403:34.66]She just gives it like a fucking grocery list.
[403:36.96]This is what I want to eat when I finally get home to see you.
[403:55.56]All right, here we go.
[403:59.30]Hey, buddy.
[403:59.96]Hi.
[404:01.12]He's on the run.
[404:02.38]Hey, Linda.
[404:05.02]Are you guys ready to leave?
[404:05.88]We are.
[404:06.46]Are you sure no one was following you?
[404:08.62]Yeah, yeah, we're fine.
[404:09.92]Let's just get going.
[404:11.66]Are you OK?
[404:12.86]I am fine.
[405:07.73]Aim!
[405:08.93]Fire!
[405:10.93]Aim!
[405:11.80]Fire!
[405:12.42]I had to.
[405:13.52]Wow.
[405:14.54]You ruined the... You were talking all through mine.
[405:17.34]Yeah, but that's because I was still angry at taking you down to, like, 81% health.
[405:37.12]21 car beam salute.
[405:40.01]I was throwing like paper airplanes at you.
[405:43.81]And like toy hammers and shit.
[406:03.16]So you got to see the funeral from your car?
[406:05.72]That's sweet.
[406:07.33]Oh, did we just drive by it?
[406:08.75]We just sped by and looked out the window?
[406:11.19]I'm pretty sure that's why she was crying, wasn't she?
[406:14.21]Weren't you guys, like, camped outside on the sidewalk, like, watching before you left?
[406:17.65]Wow, your ending was way sadder.
[406:21.69]Like, my ending, I got to go and, like, be reunited with my estranged wife and newborn daughter.
[406:28.64]Yours is, like, happy because you're alive and you escaped and you're on the run, but, like...
[406:33.92]You know what I'm saying?
[406:34.42]You already had that family, no matter what.
[406:36.44]So there wasn't really as much of a reconciliation.
[406:39.42]There wasn't like a bridge.
[406:41.32]It was more like survival.
[406:43.98]Yeah, I can see that.
[406:49.21]Anyway, I think it has to be mentioned that the split-screen aspect was actually not a gimmick, and it was a worthy...
[406:59.21]gameplay oh no I mean they built the entire the whole game was built around the split screen and the camera work was actually really good like the way that it would zoom between our uh characters in the actual chases was like 10 out of 10. you know every time um uh here's a poll by the way if you want to vote on the ending
[407:23.07]like which one is better yeah so um I say this a lot when I play like games like this uh don't you wish that these guys had like another 50 million dollars and like oh yeah a year on the game yeah it just saddens me that this shit like this exists and it could have been like an ea indie oh it could have been so so much so next level but I mean as good as it was great as it was yeah
[407:51.12]Give these people more money to, like, develop a quote-unquote full-size game.
[408:00.05]Yep.
[408:00.59]For people who are confused, Jerma was Leo and I was Vincent.
[408:03.47]Yes, I was Leo, he was Vincent.
[408:07.60]Define better.
[408:08.86]It's not a competition between the two of us.
[408:10.76]It's just about the ending.
[408:13.14]Define better.
[408:15.72]Which one did you enjoy more?
[408:16.98]No, no, no.
[408:17.84]Which one is your true ending?
[408:20.01]Uh...
[408:21.74]Is what the question is.
[408:22.58]Oh, is that the question?
[408:24.46]I mean, isn't that what you put in the straw poll?
[408:26.22]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[408:27.12]But I think someone was talking about, like, how would you make it better?
[408:31.04]Like, what would you do?
[408:32.52]Just, like, I would say this is a $30 six-hour game.
[408:38.42]Imagine a $60, like, full-length, quote-unquote, like, you know, 10- to 20-hour game.
[408:45.09]How many people were on the team at the CEO?
[408:46.87]With AAA, if you will.
[408:50.13]development backbone yeah it was still a great game no matter what where it's not not a criticism against the game it's just saying like why why do these games exist in a niche they're often like the side corner yeah
[409:06.39]We'll see, though.
[409:06.87]We'll see how people... I mean, the sales are going to be interesting considering half the people don't have to buy the game.
[409:12.56]That's going to be interesting, to say the least.
[409:14.58]But, like, they had to do it that way because it's co-op only.
[409:17.62]Like, how many people would buy this game thinking they could play with a bot?
[409:21.34]Now, at least, they buy it and they're like, oh, I have to have someone... I have to have a friend and I can invite them for free?
[409:25.69]Yeah, six to eight hours, I think, is... I would consider, like, a seven to plus hour experience, like a full experience.
[409:35.00]think no it was a full experience but we're just asking like what what is the budget for this game and how much less is it than any other ea game that's coming out this year can you play this game without another person I don't think so or is it not even it's not even possible does it just rando add you to a list of uh matchmaking I don't I don't know if you can matchmake or is it even possible I feel like you have to have a friend and that's why it's free interesting
[410:01.37]So it's just straight up you have to play with something.
[410:04.27]I forgot that.
[410:05.41]Never mind.
[410:08.25]But there is online.
[410:19.60]No, this was... You and I were looking forward to this game for a while.
[410:25.36]And I would say... The only thing I could complain about is I want more.
[410:30.79]The only thing I could complain about really is the lack of any action or anything really happening in the first couple hours of the game.
[410:37.87]It's a lot of walking around and picking up stuff and not a whole lot of anything else.
[410:43.69]Yeah, but that doesn't really bother me because it's still... The whole point of the game is a co-op game, and everything that we did was co-op related.
[410:52.37]Whether it was gimmicky or not, it was still like, all right, distract the nurse while you sneak, and now we've got to get clothes, so figure out how to get through the metal detector.
[411:01.95]There was still gameplay.
[411:05.14]I don't think it was slow.
[411:06.24]It's not that it was slow.
[411:07.74]I just think that there were a couple portions.
[411:10.44]Especially for a six-hour game.
[411:13.57]Yeah, but how much of that six hours were we actually kind of just walking around doing, like, random nonsense?
[411:18.09]There were so many set pieces, though.
[411:20.91]Yeah, but let's just talk about, like, just the video game.
[411:24.24]How much of the video game was actual video game?
[411:26.64]And how much of it were we just dicking around, like, playing minigames and, like, having, like, fun?
[411:31.40]Which is also, that's good.
[411:33.00]That's also great as well.
[411:33.78]You could ask that about, like, any Telltale Life is Strange game, but this had more gameplay than those.
[411:40.74]Oh, yeah, by a long... You can't put this in the same category as a Telltale game.
[411:46.76]I'm just saying, let's take Life is Strange.
[411:49.41]Would you finish that game and say, well, I liked it, but I wish there was more action and gameplay in the first half?
[411:57.39]I would be interested to know how long the game would take to beat if you just kind of played the game and didn't do anything else.
[412:04.71]Didn't walk around and play the banjo.
[412:07.13]It definitely would be like a three to four hour game.
[412:11.19]But that's why all those things are there.
[412:15.27]It's for you to be like, I can do this.
[412:18.23]Hey, come over here.
[412:19.33]We can do this.
[412:20.17]Because what other video game can you do?
[412:22.98]Even if they're all gimmicks, where can you do any of those gimmicks in any other video game?
[412:28.62]All in the same game.
[412:29.86]Carlos here makes a good point, chat.
[412:31.44]The game seems like it's as good as your friendship with whoever you're playing with.
[412:36.11]That is kind of true.
[412:37.89]Because if you play with someone who only wants to get to the credits, you're probably not going to have fun.
[412:43.99]Yeah.
[412:44.77]If you play with someone who, I feel like we played it kind of the ideal way, like find as much of the goofy pull the clock strings stuff on the side.
[412:55.14]And I feel like that's the way it's meant to be played.
[412:57.38]Yeah.
[412:57.86]I'm not dogging it at all.
[412:58.82]I'm not saying that that's a negative.
[413:00.54]I'm just saying just pure, like a way out the game, like how much is actually there besides the other stuff we were doing.
[413:07.66]And yeah, that is true that it is part of the experience to do all those things.
[413:12.80]But I'm just, I would just be curious to know if somebody just played through the story, like how long it would actually take.
[413:19.96]For me personally, like the shooting was like a five out of 10.
[413:24.19]The car driving was like a four out of 10.
[413:26.83]Like everything it's individually was like a four or five out of 10.
[413:30.55]But for some reason, when you put it all together and like wrap it in the story and all of the like Easter eggs and everything, and like the finale, like versus mode,
[413:40.99]It's like a nine out of 10 collectively for me.
[413:45.41]I would probably, I would probably agree.
[413:47.47]I would probably, I would probably drop it a little bit from the reason why I would say is while I was playing, it reminded me of a, and this is going to sound super stupid, but I, a video game as in like the story can be as serious as it wants, but the actual gameplay was just, I like the stupidity and the absurdity of like sitting on a seat, saw horse.
[414:10.37]Like there were video game things in the game.
[414:13.52]You know what I mean?
[414:13.96]Like you're getting, you're riding a motorcycle, getting shot by missiles.
[414:18.30]None of it makes sense.
[414:20.52]The story can be as serious as it wants, but it's like, it does.
[414:22.89]It's not afraid.
[414:23.51]It doesn't take it too seriously in the actual gameplay.
[414:26.65]Yeah.
[414:26.83]I was, I was a fan.
[414:28.35]I am completely satisfied by a way out.
[414:30.67]It was very good.
[414:32.49]And you can't go wrong for $30.
[414:33.81]You just can't.
[414:35.05]You can't do it.
[414:35.87]They give for $30 and potentially $15.
[414:39.32]You can't go.
[414:40.30]That's too good.
[414:43.02]It is so cheap.
[414:45.76]All right, I'm going to go read my credits and the bits.
[414:51.18]Thank you to Italics for playing, obviously.
[414:54.34]It was fun.
[414:54.76]I'm glad Comcast did not interrupt.
[414:57.66]Yes, it did not.
[414:58.70]Somehow, I must have been screaming for almost seven hours here.
[415:02.88]Like, I'm surprised that we didn't even get a hitch.
[415:05.58]Not once.
[415:06.94]Thank God.
[415:08.30]Yeah, so I'm glad it was just the perfect stream game.
[415:11.57]No, it was good.
[415:13.36]All right.
[415:14.44]Nice whole session.
[415:15.18]Auf Wiedersehen, as they say in France.
[415:18.58]And if I pump the microphone one more time, I'm going to pump myself in the face.
[415:22.44]You know what I mean?
[415:23.40]You know what I'm saying?
[415:24.70]Well, good night, Germas Chat.
[415:27.14]I will see you again soon because Far Cry 5 is next week.
[415:32.31]It is?
[415:32.57]It's going to be a lot of fun.
[415:33.27]And it is full campaign co-op.
[415:36.95]Take it easy, dude.
[415:37.65]Thank you.
[415:37.99]Bye, Italics History.
[415:39.31]Always a pleasure.
[415:40.71]Bye, guys, and see everyone tomorrow.
[415:44.02]Enjoy your credits and your Rap God.
[415:47.10]Good night.
[415:47.48]Bye.
[415:51.18]All right.
[415:52.48]That was a lot of fun.
[415:55.38]It's crazy.
[415:55.92]I've been streaming for... That was a seven-hour stream.
[415:59.90]I'm actually very surprised by that.
[416:01.66]That went by pretty fast.
[416:03.86]Usually, if I play a game and I sit here for more than four or five hours, I can really feel it.
[416:08.65]So that's how you can determine that I was having a lot of fun in the game.
[416:12.00]It's been seven hours and I'm just... That was great.
[416:14.97]I'm having fun still.
[416:18.81]But let's do the credits.
[416:19.95]These are all the people that subscribed and resubbed on tonight's stream.
[416:23.75]Thank you so much, everybody.
[416:24.71]If you're taking off now, I'll see you guys.
[416:27.68]I don't think I'm going to wait until Tuesday to stream.
[416:31.24]I might throw something in over the weekend here because I'm not even kidding.
[416:34.90]I really am not going to lie.
[416:36.78]I'm getting Monster Rancher 2 itches.
[416:39.55]I actually am.
[416:40.37]I want to play it again.

[419:45.33]Let's get to the bits.
[419:47.15]There were quite a lot.
[419:49.43]We were going for seven hours, so... Let me get this in the right spot here.
[419:54.86]Right here.
[419:58.54]Sleep tight?
[419:58.96]Yeah, sleep tight, guys.
[419:59.78]Thanks for coming out.
[420:03.36]This is the second stream in the last three days.
[420:08.12]More than six or seven hours?
[420:10.40]That's a first, I've never done that before.
[420:11.70]Fucking drink?
[420:14.44]I'm- I got- I got a water right here, look!
[420:18.76]That's good.
[420:20.92]Thank you to SquidChickenWing $1 here, now that, uh... I... Now that Ajit Pai saved the internet by repealing net neutrality, he promises that ISPs will expand fast, reliable internet access.
[420:34.71]Kappa.
[420:36.33]You guys have no idea.
[420:39.17]Me and Italics were just sitting there before the stream for like an hour or two.
[420:43.13]Just waiting for my internet to work.
[420:44.74]We were going to start two hours early.
[420:49.40]The plan was we were going to start streaming at like 5 or 6 Eastern.
[420:52.34]But we just couldn't.
[420:53.18]I couldn't even connect to him.
[420:54.16]My internet was just so screwed up.
[420:56.26]Such a pain in the ass.
[420:57.10]I'm moving.
[420:58.14]I really am.
[420:59.30]I gotta get out of here.
[421:00.76]I can't just, like, keep doing this every fucking... Every two days.
[421:03.64]Hmm, is the internet gonna work?
[421:05.08]I might as well just throw some dice and see if the stream stays on.
[421:09.03]That's gonna stop happening, so... I gotta find a solution.
[421:13.59]And it doesn't matter.
[421:14.11]I've called... I've had so many technicians down here.
[421:17.71]I've had, I've escalated these problems to corporate.
[421:21.60]And like, the plant.
[421:23.50]Guys at the plant know about this.
[421:26.18]And it keeps coming back, so.
[421:29.28]We'll see.
[421:31.12]Move to the EU.
[421:33.77]Wouldn't be a bad idea.
[421:37.69]Comcast is still in Arizona.
[421:39.25]What about, hold on a second.
[421:40.43]Anybody here live in Nevada?
[421:42.93]Any of you guys from Nevada?
[421:43.81]Nevada.
[421:46.76]How's the internet in Nevada?
[421:55.28]That's right, I got water in my mouth.
[422:02.64]I gotta look into that.
[422:03.46]That's not good.
[422:07.39]Don't go to Nevada.
[422:08.45]It sucks.
[422:10.01]No one actually lives in Nevada.
[422:11.53]It's so cheap though.
[422:14.18]It is so cheap to live in Nevada versus live around here.
[422:28.23]Why do I like boring states?
[422:30.97]I didn't choose the state.
[422:32.09]I wouldn't be... Why do I choose... I grew up in Massachusetts.
[422:37.71]I was born in Massachusetts.
[422:39.51]I didn't get to choose that.
[422:42.50]I now have a point in my life where I can choose where I'd like to go.
[422:47.68]You know?
[422:49.24]Rhode Island?
[422:49.82]I would love to go to Rhode Island.
[422:58.74]Rhode Island's awesome.
[423:02.30]Move to Canada.
[423:03.92]That's too much for me, though.
[423:06.24]It's still cold.
[423:06.78]I want to get away from cold.
[423:08.40]Rhode Island is still cold.
[423:14.12]But anyways, thank you to Louie for the $1.
[423:18.67]Just say hi.
[423:20.33]Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.
[423:21.51]Daddy Waddy told me to get all comfy wumpy.
[423:26.65]Grapple Mace, thanks for the $1.
[423:28.01]Keep moving butt cheeks.
[423:32.41]I don't know what that means.
[423:35.48]Thank you to Mac Jarlo for the $2.
[423:39.96]I've been watching your old videos with Star and I know you aren't friends anymore, but fuck dude, I miss it.
[423:45.94]Uh, who told you that?
[423:50.20]You got incorrect information.
[423:53.20]Thank you to Guygas Bandicoot.
[423:56.00]Thank you for the $5.
[423:56.42]Hey Jerv, it's my friend's dog's birthday today.
[424:01.43]Can you sing the birthday song from Rat Movie 2 with her name instead?
[424:05.41]The dog's name is... Ashling.
[424:11.51]Uh... You know there's a website where you can go and type in the name?
[424:17.22]And it'll put that person or dog's name in.
[424:26.07]Happy birthday.
[424:27.92]Happy birthday to your friend's dog, though.
[424:30.04]I don't know if I can do that.
[424:31.16]I'm a little exhausted.
[424:33.46]I'm a little tired here.
[424:34.41]My fingers hurt.
[424:36.43]You know, like, I was playing so poorly against Italics.
[424:39.11]It's because I expended all my energy, like, fucking having a heart attack, mashing my buttons, and... Man, my, like, my index finger and my thumb.
[424:47.13]Seriously.
[424:47.59]I need to go get a massage only for these two appendages.
[424:50.84]That's it.
[424:51.16]Nothing else.
[424:55.54]But, thank you, dude.
[424:57.16]Happy birthday to Ashling.
[424:59.90]You know, cake and ice cream is on the way.
[425:02.43]You've been such a good boy this year.
[425:03.79]Just open up your fucking gifts while we're at it.
[425:09.57]Excuses?
[425:11.65]That's the- alright, you could call it an excuse.
[425:14.62]But how many of you guys that play 99% on PC with a mouse and keyboard, when somebody hands you a controller, you're just like, I don't know what the fuck to do with this thing.
[425:29.25]Happens to me every time I have to shoot a weapon in an analog-controlled game.
[425:34.48]Can't do it.
[425:43.00]Some of you can relate.
[425:43.83]Maybe some of you can't.
[425:44.59]That's alright.
[425:45.29]I will take the blame for not being able to shoot it out of italics.
[425:51.05]Which is not good.
[425:56.56]But thank you, though.
[425:59.90]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1.
[426:01.19]I read that to beat the final boss, you have to expose his dodgy finances after crawling through a mile of shit.
[426:07.47]And then make him shoot himself.
[426:11.15]What are you talking about?
[426:18.05]Thanks, though, dude.
[426:18.71]Thank you, Moo.
[426:24.24]MacJarlow, thanks for the $1.
[426:25.48]Derma versus Star.
[426:28.00]Everybody wants to see it happen.
[426:32.48]And somebody's flying through the call, making comments.
[426:38.84]Thank you, Neural Shock for the 95 cents, Scooby Doo Squad.
[426:41.44]Ah.
[426:41.50]Yeah.
[426:47.65]That probably would have been funny three hours ago.
[426:55.37]Sorry, well, this is what happens when the stream goes for seven hours.
[426:57.83]This happened, all right, last time on the Monster Rancher 2 stream, that was 10 hours.
[427:02.55]We were reading bits and you're talking about this shit.
[427:04.47]Well, this shit happened almost a whole day ago, right?
[427:08.95]It's not like two or three hours ago, like a tip.
[427:11.39]Well, one of when I stream typically, right?
[427:13.39]It's what?
[427:14.90]Maybe three to five hours, like four hours average for like an average stream.
[427:20.02]When we go like seven to 10 hours, that shit is like, I don't even remember what I even said.
[427:24.22]I don't remember what game I was playing tonight.
[427:26.78]What was I playing seven hours ago?
[427:29.51]I don't know.
[427:31.25]It's a way out.
[427:31.97]The only reason why I know that is because Italics was still here.
[427:33.85]And I could, like, wake up.
[427:38.04]Every, like, four hours.
[427:39.04]I could, like, be like, oh, I'm still doing this.
[427:45.64]Uh, thank you, uh, Guesso18 for the 25 cents.
[427:48.59]I say forehead, thank you.
[427:53.67]Moo means moo, thanks for the one dollar.
[427:55.53]Love my Toyota Primus.
[427:58.05]Gets great gas mileage, good for the environment.
[428:04.86]uh effectator effectator thanks for the two bucks been in an editing slump so I took your advice and challenged myself to edit a highlight video less than 24 hours after stream ended and I succeeded made a full highlight bit of it yesterday's council stream what should I do with it thoughts although are unofficial highlights allowed or should I just delete it love you either way um I mean I look here's the here's the official stance on stuff like this
[428:35.62]Holy Mac edits the streams and he puts them up on the second channel.
[428:42.69]So Holy Mac is kind of the official guy that makes all the stream edits.
[428:48.69]So, I mean, I'm not gonna like DMCA claim your YouTube channel if you put like a stream up.
[428:56.26]But the only thing I would probably say is with highlights,
[429:01.84]I mean, Mac is kind of, he's kind of got that locked down.
[429:05.73]So, if he ever needs help or something for some reason eventually down the road, then I could see how we could open up maybe a few other people that would help him.
[429:15.22]People are still arguing.
[429:16.28]What do you mean?
[429:17.96]The chat is still debating a way out.
[429:22.02]Yeah, don't delete it.
[429:24.07]Please don't delete it.
[429:29.86]But there's a channel that I think archives every single stream I've ever done.
[429:35.83]So it's... I would say as long as you're not... I guess...
[429:42.98]It's tricky.
[429:43.88]It's hard to say that because what happens, here's the thing.
[429:46.76]Let's say somebody made a highlight video of me doing something in A Way Out.
[429:51.38]And we're talking total hypotheticals here, right?
[429:54.55]Somebody makes a, takes, rips the stream and they make a video and they put it on YouTube or whatever.
[429:59.71]And for some reason, oh, fully to a fucking 20 million views.
[430:05.39]And that video gets monetized.
[430:08.08]It's just like, oh.
[430:10.72]Shit.
[430:14.72]You can find the Swindle stream on YouTube.
[430:19.29]Now, I'm not saying that's ever going to happen.
[430:22.75]But, I kind of just have like a don't care attitude towards it.
[430:27.27]As long as... It's really... I don't... I just... It's over... I don't want anyone to overstep Holy Mac's bounds.
[430:35.21]But... It's... I would never claim somebody's channel ever.
[430:39.85]I find that to be fucking stupid.
[430:47.42]does italics upload stream stuff I don't know italics still does like makes gaming youtube videos for his youtube channel he doesn't have like a second channel the stream archive channel that even if you do monetize like I I don't really don't like I don't even care like you know what I mean it's not that big of a deal to me
[431:11.12]It's... It really becomes... The only deal when it becomes... Is... So, Mac... Mac and I... Split.
[431:20.00]Essentially.
[431:21.44]The revenue from the second channel.
[431:23.12]Mac... Essentially owns half of that channel.
[431:26.06]At this point.
[431:28.00]So... He... He gets paid.
[431:32.36]So, you know, if you have a highlight video that is... You know, comes out and maybe takes some views away from the video he makes, you know... You get into that, but...
[431:44.81]You do?
[431:45.23]Yeah, of course.
[431:46.27]Fuck, he does a great job.
[431:47.51]Why wouldn't I want him to take a bunch of money from that?
[431:53.48]A good guy paying his editors?
[431:54.98]Are you fucking serious?
[431:56.16]When people don't pay their editors?
[432:01.34]Hold on, wait, wait.
[432:02.06]People don't, like, pay their editors on, like, Twitch and YouTube?
[432:05.56]Is this a thing that I'm just hearing about now?
[432:20.31]I mean, they have to.
[432:27.63]Yeah, but he deserves it.
[432:28.23]He deserves that.
[432:28.81]He does a hell of a job.
[432:29.55]He deserves half the fucking channel.
[432:35.24]He just does.
[432:46.84]If you hear Mac, you fucking deserve it.
[432:49.20]You've done an absolutely phenomenal job.
[433:00.27]They get paid in exposure.
[433:08.61]But long story short, please have fun making highlights of these streams.
[433:15.81]The only thing I would say again is, like, if Holy Mac is probably gonna make a video on it, just know that there'll be a video already with a highlight of the same thing.
[433:26.08]But for practice purposes, if you want to upload them and store them and share them with people, absolutely.
[433:30.36]Like, that's... I have nothing... no problem at all with that.
[433:34.59]Not even a slightly problem.
[433:35.81]Not even a slightly a problem.
[433:45.61]But, anyways.
[433:51.48]Thank you, though.
[433:52.04]I wish you luck.
[433:53.02]Keep challenging yourself, editing-wise.
[433:55.22]Keep fucking around with footage.
[433:58.18]There was male nudity on stream.
[433:59.56]Oh, yeah, there was.
[434:00.10]A lot of it.
[434:02.94]Thank you to Just a Rowboat for the $1.
[434:04.58]Appreciate it.
[434:05.18]Edgemont, thanks for the $50 again earlier.
[434:09.26]Edgemont was not able to watch the stream, but dropped a $50 bill on the table when walked out the door.
[434:16.23]If you watch it eventually, dude, thank you so much.
[434:21.99]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the quarter here.
[434:23.79]This game brings back memories of when Odie and I broke out of the pond.
[434:29.48]Odie and I fell down our fair share of wall-climbing, quick-time segments.
[434:34.33]Anyway, I've just gotten back into the dating game and I've forgotten how to play.
[434:37.07]Jeremy, you're a human.
[434:37.97]Where's a good place to take a human female for her first few dates?
[434:41.23]We've already been talking about movie nights.
[434:43.51]But any other ideas for an orange cat looking to impress?
[434:45.68]First of all, guys, don't go to a restaurant on a first date.
[434:51.14]And don't go to a movie.
[434:53.36]Here's why.
[434:54.54]When you go to a restaurant, I don't know why people do this.
[434:56.90]It's absurd.
[434:58.69]We've talked about it before, but I'm going to reiterate it one more time.
[435:01.76]When you go to a restaurant with a male, female, whoever, you're eating and talking at the same time, and it becomes incredibly awkward.
[435:11.26]You order a bunch of fucking food, and, oh yeah, I gotta get like the steak, I'll get a salad, and it's so... Nobody likes to be watched eating.
[435:20.25]It's embarrassing.
[435:21.07]It feels weird when you're having a conversation with somebody you don't really know that well, and you're eating food in front of them.
[435:25.57]You don't want them to see you eating.
[435:27.17]It's almost an embarrassment.
[435:29.30]And you don't want to go to a movie, because a movie is just silence.
[435:32.56]And you're just sitting there staring at a screen in silence next to somebody that you're supposed to be having a conversation with and talking to.
[435:40.13]And... I don't know.
[435:41.95]That's... I would steer clear of that.
[435:44.35]Where I would go, I would go get something like a cup of coffee.
[435:48.45]Go get coffee, you're able to sip and talk.
[435:51.19]It doesn't have to be that long.
[435:52.32]You're not supposed to sit in a coffee shop for like three hours.
[435:55.58]Some people go out to dinner and they eat dinner for fucking two hours.
[435:58.18]Right?
[435:59.62]Just go get a cup of coffee.
[436:01.86]It takes 30 minutes.
[436:03.56]And then you can gauge, okay, is everything going alright?
[436:05.86]How are things going?
[436:07.16]Go bowling.
[436:08.17]That's perfect.
[436:10.35]You know how many high fives you get when you bowl?
[436:11.93]Like, high five!
[436:12.89]And it makes connections and bonding.
[436:18.15]Go for a walk, that's a good one.
[436:19.25]Like, go for like a walk.
[436:21.00]In, like for instance, some, in the city.
[436:22.98]Just walk around the city, take a look at stuff, go in the stores.
[436:25.74]Don't go to a restaurant.
[436:27.38]You're gonna burp.
[436:28.94]In the middle of that dinner.
[436:30.38]And it's gonna ruin everything.
[436:33.16]You're gonna be talking, and your asparagus went down the wrong pipe, and you're gonna go like, So, hey, so, and you're gonna turn red.
[436:42.76]You're gonna start turning bright fucking red.
[436:45.83]And then you're gonna try to make an excuse about why you're turning red.
[436:48.46]Dad, I think they turned the heat up or something.
[436:49.98]It's like, are you hot?
[436:51.00]It's really hot in here.
[436:52.36]And then you're gonna bump the fucking table with your knee like, oh shit!
[436:55.40]And then the waiter's gonna come over, the drink already spilled, a full glass of water, all over her dress.
[437:03.46]And at the same point, at this point, you gotta make an exit.
[437:14.36]Go to an arcade.
[437:17.83]You'll punch the mic.
[437:18.73]I didn't punch the mic.
[437:19.53]I need my table.
[437:22.95]But anyways, there's your advice.
[437:29.00]Then you take her to a movie.
[437:38.62]Hurry and end the stream before our date gets awkward.
[437:45.09]That's fucking funny.
[437:47.26]Anyways, thanks a lot, dude.
[437:48.62]Good luck, Garfield.
[437:51.36]Thank you also to... CMBRY for the 25 cents that you scream into the microphone.
[437:57.79]SuperSeal, thanks for the 25 cents.
[437:59.61]Hey guys, hey guys, you don't say, you don't say.
[438:01.35]Whatever that means.
[438:04.13]AceMcLace, thank you for the $50 earlier.
[438:07.13]5000, talking about killing italics.
[438:10.69]I tried, I failed.
[438:13.04]Miserably at that, if you missed it.
[438:15.59]Sputnik34, thanks for the three bucks.
[438:17.05]This is all the bits I have, Germo.
[438:18.91]I haven't been on in a long time.
[438:20.59]I just moved for the first time and I'm freaking out.
[438:22.91]But coming to your stream will brighten up my day.
[438:24.59]Thanks for being you.
[438:25.97]Good luck with your move.
[438:27.65]Yeah, focus on your move.
[438:29.74]Make sure you get your bed frame in there.
[438:31.52]And don't break it.
[438:32.52]I've broken a bed frame before.
[438:34.80]I got so excited when I moved into my new place that I just started jumping on the bed up and down, putting my hands as fists up and down, side to side, up to the air, down to my sides, up to the air, down to my sides, and I was jumping.
[438:46.51]I smashed the center of my board.
[438:48.81]I broke it in half.
[438:53.53]Don't be like me.
[439:00.81]Thank you, Allotrain, for the $3.05.
[439:01.94]This game is fucking great.
[439:04.94]Have my bits, senpai.
[439:07.84]Thank you.
[439:08.12]Appreciate it.
[439:12.18]Thank you, Nick, for the $1.00.
[439:13.06]They just say clock.
[439:16.64]That happened when he was 32, by the way.
[439:17.79]That happened when I was 30.
[439:18.51]That doesn't make it any better.
[439:22.33]I mean, I just want to correct the record there.
[439:25.53]Acknowledge John.
[439:26.51]Thanks for the $10.00.
[439:27.33]Guys, you missed the clock.
[439:28.37]It's at the top of the stairs.
[439:29.37]Okay.
[439:31.06]Thank you for the $10, dude.
[439:34.86]Appreciate it, man.
[439:36.62]Djack, thanks for the $1.
[439:37.86]What's the most viewers you've ever had at one time?
[439:39.98]3.5k today is the most that I've ever seen.
[439:42.68]Keep it up, champ.
[439:45.92]I think it was like 6,000 or 7,000 for the first Jermos Rumble stream, I think.
[439:54.06]That's really awesome though.
[439:55.74]I'm very happy and surprised by that number.
[439:59.52]It was like 6500 to 6300 for one of the first rumbles.
[440:04.65]Which was, that was fucking crazy.
[440:09.33]Was it 8k?
[440:10.79]I don't remember.
[440:11.32]The Overwatch launch.
[440:16.70]Oh, when I painted Roadhog, there was a lot of people there too, I think.
[440:21.19]I don't remember the exact number, but there was quite a few people for Roadhog.
[440:24.41]Because that was right before the game came out.
[440:30.43]Maybe.
[440:32.55]Yeah, I think those are the answers there.
[440:37.01]Thank you CMBRai again for the one dollar.
[440:39.35]Talix is the sweet mother who supports our curiosity.
[440:42.45]Meanwhile, Jerma is our mean father who tells us to man up when we cry.
[440:56.38]Deadly SP, thank you for the $10.
[441:00.46]Jermboy, please stop treating us like this.
[441:02.31]We love you, love us back, stop abusing us.
[441:04.63]What did I do?
[441:06.99]What did I do?
[441:07.51]You guys are awesome.
[441:09.63]What did I do?
[441:13.07]Thank you, though.
[441:15.12]Geodem, $16, thanks for the $3.
[441:17.24]Kills like 30 cops.
[441:19.54]That guy's a cold-blooded killer.
[441:23.38]He sure is.
[441:26.31]Stix Renegade, thanks for the $1.
[441:28.55]Now, I usually have my breakfast, which consists of tasty spam.
[441:32.09]I could eat it all day long, but I only love one brand, and I can't find it way out here.
[441:36.91]So I have to take a pass and settle for some hash.
[441:40.07]Oh, sweet, sweet spam.
[441:42.54]I lied, I've never tasted spam.
[441:44.38]I was just saying song lyrics.
[441:46.22]Oh.
[441:50.32]Thank you, Illy Nock for the $1.
[441:52.28]Top of the line...
[441:58.35]Oh, you're talking about when we were butt-to-butt there.
[442:05.39]Ninja and Drake?
[442:06.26]Yeah, Ninja and Drake, um... They had like a 600-something thousand.
[442:15.82]That's fucking crazy.
[442:16.65]I don't even know what to do with myself.
[442:19.89]I would seriously think it was a bug if that happened.
[442:24.54]You know, I would think, here's what I would think, I would think it was either a really bad bug, or I pissed off the wrong person.
[442:35.81]You know, that's either something really, really bad, or the computer program fucked up.
[442:47.44]Leave the spoon, thanks for the 25 cents.
[442:49.92]Just slap on some flex tape, it's good as new.
[442:56.50]Uh, thank you MajorBluetooth for the three dollars.
[442:58.80]Jeremiah, I've been watching you ever since the days when you bleeped out your swears.
[443:02.09]Wow, that's, that's like 2000, that's like 2011.
[443:06.63]Holy shit.
[443:09.31]Wow.
[443:12.69]I've been through the conga line of flying punching people, the desperate attempt to stop the car crash, and even the raid on the corporate tower to bring back the original Zumbinis.
[443:21.64]I look forward to the day I can meet you in person.
[443:24.16]So you can throw my car keys off the roof.
[443:26.15]Stay sneaky.
[443:27.97]Stay germy.
[443:28.57]Thank you, Major.
[443:30.89]You bleeped out.
[443:31.43]Yeah, like seven years ago.
[443:33.05]We're talking about when I first made my YouTube channel.
[443:38.87]This was like six and a half.
[443:40.13]This was like seven fucking years ago.
[443:43.47]I didn't even know if you could swear on YouTube.
[443:46.53]I thought it was bad.
[443:47.51]I thought you could get in trouble for that.
[443:49.76]I actually thought that you could get in trouble.
[443:53.11]Like you couldn't get your channel partnered or something if you had offensive language.
[443:57.65]And it's really funny because now the complete opposite is what happened.
[444:01.47]Seven years later, apparently they're trying to really scoop up and clean up YouTube, I guess, somehow.
[444:11.18]It went the other way around.
[444:15.92]YouTube sucks.
[444:17.08]Like, don't even get me started.
[444:20.28]You had a YouTube channel?
[444:21.54]Yeah.
[444:21.66]Yeah.
[444:23.65]I have, there are like a thousand videos on my YouTube channel.
[444:28.80]And no, we're not talking about, we're not talking about a thousand like episode one of The Witcher 2 Let's Play and episode like 367 episode of The Witcher 2 Let's Play.
[444:40.76]We're talking pretty much like 1,000 pieces of solo singular episodic content.
[444:48.97]I'll check it out sometime.
[444:59.31]Washed up.
[445:00.95]Yeah, you can't be washed up if you didn't start cleaning again, right?
[445:07.03]I haven't even taken out the mop yet, guys.
[445:10.01]You can't call me washed up till you see what you see next.
[445:13.54]Uh-uh.
[445:15.16]The cleaning supplies are in the closet still.
[445:17.70]Didn't take them out yet.
[445:20.56]If you don't like what you see, then sure, call me washed up.
[445:24.46]I would applaud it.
[445:26.53]You don't like what you see here in the next couple of months?
[445:29.83]Go ahead, call me.
[445:30.83]Tell me I'm washed up.
[445:31.75]Tell me I'm unclean.
[445:38.51]I haven't even begun to peek, okay?
[445:45.56]Thank you, though.
[445:46.54]Appreciate it, man.
[445:49.94]Niall Orian, thank you for the $1.
[445:51.79]You missed this donation.
[445:52.89]Try another.
[445:57.18]Technically, all you've done in the past two years is annual updates.
[446:00.68]True, but also, we're talking about what have I done on Twitch, right?
[446:07.61]We've done a lot of things on Twitch over the last couple of years.
[446:12.35]And yes, I'm not going to lie, YouTube has kind of become a piece of shit.
[446:18.29]All this happened, I think, real talk, let's get real here.
[446:24.38]YouTube started to really fuck up its website a couple years ago.
[446:28.98]They started to change all their algorithms, they started to mess with the... the advertising, the friendly advertising nonsense.
[446:36.91]They shot themselves in the foot so many times with YouTube that it pushed a lot of people away, me included.
[446:44.07]And there were sub box problems... I'm gonna go over a scenario with you guys.
[446:49.79]Some of those videos that I was making on YouTube took more than a week to make, right?
[446:55.17]Almost like two fucking weeks to make some of those videos.
[446:57.98]For me to upload that to YouTube and half of my subscribers to not even see it because they didn't get it in their subscription box was...
[447:09.18]Like, what the fuck?
[447:10.40]It was such a horrible feeling knowing like, okay, I made this video and... You're telling me like maybe like 30 to 40% of every person that subscribed is not going to get it?
[447:21.87]Ah, okay.
[447:23.15]Thanks.
[447:25.38]That started happening a lot.
[447:27.86]There was a ton of technical problems.
[447:29.38]There was a bunch of... They were really pushing the site in a dumb direction in my opinion.
[447:36.86]And it pushed me away.
[447:37.96]And that doesn't mean I'm not going to make a YouTube video ever again.
[447:39.90]That just means I want to adapt and change the game here for me.
[447:46.19]I would like these two platforms to work together.
[447:54.63]And it's almost like adapting...
[447:58.54]It's adapting in the sense that I wanted to make YouTube videos on my main channel, and then more of the YouTube shit happened, and it pushed me away even further, so now it's adapting again.
[448:08.28]It's adapting to my adaptation that I had previously, so it's been a little more difficult.
[448:17.18]But that doesn't mean that you're not going to see that type of content or that type of video ever again.
[448:23.26]That just means I'm trying different ways to do it.
[448:26.58]One of those things is... How many people are here?
[448:28.30]Okay, there's like a thousand.
[448:30.34]That's alright.
[448:32.98]You're going to see a lot of live content.
[448:34.36]You're going to see stuff that I hope you've probably never seen before on this website.
[448:43.53]I hope.
[448:44.31]I'm going to try to do that.
[448:47.11]I would like to mix video scripted content with live material.
[448:55.00]There are a lot of things that we're working on here that are just that.
[448:59.68]Setting up in a location that's not in my basement in like an office or in a studio.
[449:07.58]And you watch like a fucking show that's played out live that's a scripted event.
[449:15.21]That's what I want to do.
[449:18.97]Not pre-recording.
[449:19.81]I'm talking about just live, but not a... you know, typical live stream.
[449:28.65]Live pre-recorded content.
[449:33.59]Sometimes I can get a little too ambitious.
[449:36.47]I agree, but these things won't be.
[449:38.91]They're not that... These things I'm talking about are not that ambitious, at least to start.
[449:48.74]I'm not talking about a sitcom.
[449:53.32]I'm not talking about a sitcom.
[449:55.82]I'm not gonna like open the door and be like, Here I am!
[449:58.02]And like fucking laugh tracks and stuff.
[449:59.82]No.
[450:10.47]How do I explain the editing in the meme funeral?
[450:14.99]I mean, that's not what I'm describing.
[450:19.23]doing jokey streams every now and again where I, you know, might pre-record a couple of things is different than the thing I'm talking about.
[450:32.96]All it takes is for us to get in this a couple of spots.
[450:38.05]If I get, if I get this, if I can sign the paper on this latest thing that we're working on, I get to sign the paper that says, yes, you are allowed to fucking film here.
[450:47.97]You'll see it as soon as possible.
[450:49.59]It'll happen like fucking a week later.
[450:51.75]Not even.
[450:54.67]The guy that helped me make Jerma Rumble Live... Is working desperately on trying to make this a reality.
[451:02.14]Because he... Is... In a more of a producer role.
[451:06.66]Whereas I would be... You know, I would... Write a lot of it.
[451:11.74]He would write a lot of it too.
[451:13.64]He would... You know, go through and try to find locations...
[451:18.50]I would direct, you know, direct.
[451:21.75]Action!
[451:22.61]Okay, now I want you over there.
[451:23.67]Like, I mean, that's what we did with German Rum Alive.
[451:28.09]And it was a lot of fun.
[451:29.45]And I want to do it again.
[451:30.19]And I'm going to get a chance to do it again.
[451:32.67]No sort of prank video in a grocery store.
[451:36.39]Prank video in a grocery store.
[451:41.55]No.
[451:42.69]You'll see.
[451:47.15]I hope it happens.
[451:48.61]Because it'll give you an idea of what I'm talking about.
[451:51.49]When we've had these conversations over the last couple of months.
[451:57.34]Anyways, moving on from that.
[451:58.96]Just to last nail the coffin there.
[452:02.60]YouTube sucks.
[452:04.56]It became a shitty platform for creators.
[452:09.24]And I want to still make stuff.
[452:12.86]But not necessarily all exclusively there.
[452:17.94]I've had to adapt it a couple of times.
[452:20.49]And not only... Oh, Tom, we can get into this.
[452:22.93]Like, there was talk of me going to live in California and working with a fucking couple of companies.
[452:29.59]Did I even mention who they were?
[452:30.75]I probably did.
[452:32.45]That was a lot of talking and a lot of shit just I wasn't comfortable with.
[452:36.83]So it's a slow process, but it'll happen.
[452:41.29]Anyways.
[452:43.80]Uh, Garfield the Monday Killer.
[452:46.64]Thank you.
[452:48.74]yes it was the machinima thing okay you guys wanted brothers you guys know already okay cool yeah I was gonna I was there was talk that I was gonna go out there and do a bunch of and just didn't work I well I didn't like it I didn't want to do it that's it that's pretty much all there is to it didn't really work out that's all that needs to be said uh devlon two million thank you for the one dollar
[453:15.17]I walk in the stream and you're playing a children's game.
[453:17.55]A children's game?
[453:20.37]How is A Way Out a children's game?
[453:26.90]What the fuck?
[453:29.78]Anyways, thank you.
[453:32.04]Thank you CMBRY for the 25 cents.
[453:34.18]Is this the same streamer who lost Connect Four?
[453:37.32]I won Connect Four.
[453:39.21]And then I made a jokey loss in Connect Four.
[453:41.43]And then I actually lost in Connect Four.
[453:43.35]Don't forget it.
[453:44.33]Don't scuff my victories.
[453:46.51]The real victories that I had.
[453:49.55]Don't scuff my arm wrestling victories.
[453:51.29]My one Connect Four victory.
[453:55.69]From the record there.
[454:01.25]Thank you to Silver EXP again for, I think, $100 here now.
[454:06.22]Understandable, have a nice day, Bible Thump.
[454:08.50]Sorry that you got accidentally banned by Nightbot.
[454:14.42]Sleepy Sunset, thanks for the $1.
[454:16.00]Wahoo, wahee, here comes the baby.
[454:21.38]Yes.
[454:24.31]Not to mention, you know, the actual game.
[454:26.71]Someone go back and look at one more.
[454:31.55]Do I have to put... Do I have to flash my... Blockbuster Video Game Championship cardigan?
[454:38.09]It's down there.
[454:40.18]Do I have to put that on my wall, Italics, for you to see that the next time you come over when you walk in my house?
[454:44.98]And you walk in my front door and you look over and you see staring at you from across the room?
[454:49.80]Blockbuster 1995 Video Game Donkey Kong Country Champion?
[454:54.66]I wouldn't want to embarrass you like that.
[455:02.48]Thank you to Lethal Spoon for the 25 cents.
[455:08.21]Streamer dies of heart attack from lifting virtual weights.
[455:11.47]What about the weights?
[455:12.93]Huh?
[455:14.05]I gave myself a heart attack to win that minigame.
[455:16.98]That's at least three minigames, correctedly one.
[455:23.68]Bala Sparkle, thank you for the 49 cents.
[455:26.54]They say I get it, 49 cents.
[455:30.58]Grapple Mace, thanks for the $1.
[455:31.78]They say 1 in 5 people don't even make it to the ground.
[455:35.98]You talking about parachuting?
[455:40.48]Couldn't even get to 12.
[455:41.24]Alright, if you guys... Let me tell you something.
[455:43.70]If you play a way out, go to that work, go to that bench, sit down, get to 10, get to 11, and then come talk to me.
[455:52.97]Come talk to me.
[455:53.71]I want you to come talk to me when you get to 11, and then we'll have a conversation about it.
[456:07.01]Did you have a heart attack to get there?
[456:12.49]Always upvote Drake and Josh?
[456:21.29]Drake and Jo- What are you talking about?
[456:24.61]Oh, Luke88, thanks for the one dollar.
[456:26.55]I can't believe I've been watching this for seven hours straight.
[456:29.45]I'm going to bed before I fucking die.
[456:33.37]Thank you for coming out, Luke.
[456:35.71]Please don't die.
[456:39.41]Lethal Spoon, thanks for the 25 cents.
[456:41.25]Tsk, tsk, if only you interacted with the lawnmower for the true ending.
[456:48.79]Lethal Spoon, thanks again.
[456:50.01]How could you?
[456:50.69]We played Grenade Brothers together.
[456:56.24]Alexander Gabriel, thanks for the 25 cents.
[457:01.94]I want to say that this is genuinely one of the best co-op games I've seen in literally years.
[457:06.36]It's got a really decent story.
[457:07.70]The Leo Lives ending nearly had me in tears to the letter and all.
[457:11.64]And the game comes together to make you really care for the characters.
[457:14.02]Thank you for sitting there and playing this together.
[457:17.70]Absolutely.
[457:18.22]The game was... It was fantastic.
[457:20.44]It was very good.
[457:21.26]I would have given it somewhere close to a 9 out of 10.
[457:27.45]That is a great friend-o video game.
[457:31.38]Very good.
[457:32.16]Highly recommend.
[457:36.32]Techno Toast.
[457:37.74]Thanks for the $1.
[457:38.54]Jeremiah, I had such a good time watching you and Italics play this game together.
[457:42.27]It was absolutely perfect.
[457:43.53]A great friendship game.
[457:44.73]I'm still crying from both endings by both of them.
[457:48.19]It was.
[457:48.49]It was very fun.
[457:51.69]Thank you for sticking around as long as you did.
[457:53.95]Those of you guys that watched the whole thing, that's a long time to be sitting here.
[457:59.67]A few more here.
[458:00.47]AceMcLace, thanks for the $5.
[458:03.67]Thanks for the stream.
[458:04.23]I really enjoyed it.
[458:04.93]I think the story was great.
[458:06.01]Even if some of the gameplay elements were silly, it was a blast to watch.
[458:09.34]Looking forward to the Far Cry 5 VOD after I finish the game.
[458:12.74]Thanks for being the best.
[458:14.06]Thank you, Ace.
[458:16.02]Far Cry 5 is next on the list.
[458:18.92]In... Jeremy and Italics play a co-op game together.
[458:22.75]We will be playing Far Cry 5.
[458:25.35]Which is in a couple days.
[458:27.15]So... Yeah.
[458:28.79]You'll be seeing Italics again.
[458:30.81]Very soon.
[458:37.82]Thank you.
[458:40.82]You're horrible at every game you play, but I love you.
[458:49.56]Am I though?
[458:50.28]Let's be real for a second.
[458:53.44]How many times have you seen me do something pogchamp on stream?
[458:57.10]And it was like, holy shit.
[458:59.43]I've seen it.
[459:00.97]I've watched a VOD of myself playing a game and I was like, damn, I wish I was that good.
[459:08.57]To be fair, there are other times where I've watched a VOD back or I watched a clip back and I wonder if somebody was behind me covering my eyes with their hands.
[459:20.72]I mean, come on.
[459:23.82]We're all humans here.
[459:26.73]Everybody in this chat is a human.
[459:37.84]You fucking suck.
[459:40.08]Narcissist?
[459:40.86]No, I said we're talking about equal.
[459:43.56]I have one hand out.
[459:45.26]My right hand has somebody covering my eyes with both their hands.
[459:48.92]My left hand is getting all the fireworks in point blank.
[459:56.26]Sometimes there's a scale there.
[459:58.66]I'm not sure which is heavier, but it doesn't mean that half the scale doesn't exist.
[460:04.49]When is the accused stream?
[460:05.73]That's going to happen next week, Friday.
[460:09.44]Friday of next week, plan on the I sit and chat and accuse everybody.
[460:18.69]And yes, I'll be playing the Dark Souls remaster.
[460:20.69]And I'll be beating it on stream.
[460:22.07]And I will be saying all the whole way through, Oh, well, isn't that interesting?
[460:26.67]Beat that guy first try.
[460:27.72]And there's going to be people fucking raging in the chat being like, There's no way!
[460:34.84]What the fuck?
[460:36.14]I took 16 attempts!
[460:47.13]He'll be summoning me.
[460:51.92]But yeah, the accusation stream will be probably Friday.
[460:54.24]If we can get a couple of bots made.
[460:55.62]Because there's a lot of moving parts.
[460:56.98]Quick, write down his chat mannerisms.
[461:09.67]Oh god.
[461:11.39]But anyways, thank you ProCifProStar for the... One dollar.
[461:15.85]Yesterday I asked you if I could use you in a school project.
[461:18.76]Just wanted to let you know that it's an audio story that has a very positive message about you.
[461:23.80]Hope I get an A-.
[461:24.64]Um... Thanks, man.
[461:32.17]I hope you get a... Let's shoot for some realistic... Let's be realistic here.
[461:37.65]I hope you get like a C+.
[461:39.99]No, I don't.
[461:40.51]That's fucking mean.
[461:41.65]I'm kidding.
[461:42.09]I hope you get an A+.
[461:43.95]I'm immediately going to correct that because that was just a joke.
[461:46.51]Because then if you got like an A, it was going to be like, see, I set the bar low for you so you could just step right over it easily.
[461:53.08]It was just a joke.
[461:54.40]I'm kidding.
[461:54.90]I hope you fucking blow through it, man.
[461:56.82]I hope you get an A+.
[462:01.29]Halfway through saying that, I realized that I was like, maybe I shouldn't be saying that.
[462:04.45]He's going to get an A.
[462:09.24]What an asshole.
[462:10.20]No, I'm sorry.
[462:12.58]I was trying to make a thing where the limbo bar is so high that you could just walk under the limbo bar.
[462:20.06]You don't even need to bend back.
[462:21.83]That was the point that I was trying to... Ugh.
[462:25.31]Forget it.
[462:26.91]Procef, thank you so much for even thinking of doing your... your project on me.
[462:38.07]I'm sorry.
[462:41.26]It was in bad taste.
[462:42.62]I apologize.
[462:44.47]I'm gonna go on an apology tour.
[462:47.47]Thank you, Fred Flintstone, for the $1.
[462:48.77]They just say daddy.
[462:50.39]Okay, thank you.
[462:52.37]CMBRY.
[462:55.29]Thanks for the 50 cents.
[462:56.25]Sweepy time.
[462:57.04]Yes, it is.
[462:59.00]Sdogman.
[462:59.84]Thanks for the $1.
[463:00.72]Sincere thanks for streaming until 5 in the afternoon, Germa.
[463:02.94]Are you planning on one day coming to Australia so I can meet my idol?
[463:09.00]It's on the bucket list.
[463:09.93]It is.
[463:11.93]Tokyo is on the bucket list.
[463:14.67]Probably like Sydney is on the bucket list.
[463:18.13]England, Ireland, Scotland on the bucket list.
[463:21.71]France, Spain, Missouri.
[463:27.28]Probably Denmark, Norway, Utah, Rhode Island, Mexico, El Salvador, Brazil, Antarctica,
[463:43.16]South Korea.
[463:46.70]China.
[463:47.88]Russia.
[463:50.64]Yeah, pretty much all of them, I'd say.
[464:00.36]Jesus, man.
[464:01.25]Save some planet for the rest of them.
[464:05.75]Streamer names all 53 states.
[464:11.16]thank you too reaper 500 only three or four more here guys reaper 500 thanks for the dollar you should do a sitcom that is so campy and by the books just to piss off people just you kim and anyone else you could get it would be great I feel like I do a lot of that already I feel like I do like very intentionally campy shit things
[464:37.02]And I probably already piss off a bunch of random new people that don't know who I am.
[464:41.64]We've had many conversations about things that people would walk into and hate the stream.
[464:46.74]It's possible.
[464:47.66]There's a lot.
[464:48.22]Think of how many things that that's possible with.
[464:50.17]In the last week.
[464:52.01]I could probably name you ten.
[464:55.85]On both fingers and toes.
[465:00.99]Go to North Korea.
[465:05.76]I don't think that's in the plans.
[465:07.52]Sorry I've been to Canada Yeah, I've been to Montreal I've been to I've driven through Canada parts of it It's a nice place But thank you to moo means moo and
[465:30.00]For the multiple $1, $1, blue as the sky and green as the grass, Jerma, you're in my springtime.
[465:36.88]Suck my ass.
[465:38.20]No, suck a fart out of my ass.
[465:39.50]Okay.
[465:40.18]Thanks.
[465:42.29]And lastly, Tingy, for the $5, I'm sorry to bring down the vibe, but bring down the vibe?
[465:48.43]What do you mean?
[465:48.81]But I just wanted to let you know that, uh, how much your content and streams mean to me.
[465:53.23]The past two years have been the toughest times I've ever been through, and you make my days immensely better.
[465:58.63]There are days where you make me laugh through my tears.
[466:00.93]I honestly can't thank you enough for all that you do.
[466:02.91]Much love.
[466:05.45]I'm sorry you feel that way sometimes over the last couple of years, man.
[466:13.80]Anybody that ever says anything like this to me, all I can say is I'm truly grounded to know that I am contributing to help you.
[466:27.38]I hope you get better.
[466:28.14]I hope you feel better.
[466:31.42]But it always just blows my mind when I know these things.
[466:39.72]Thank you so much for being here.
[466:41.59]Seriously.
[466:43.89]Shout out the Discord again, please.
[466:45.17]It's a great community here.
[466:54.82]If you're not aware.
[466:56.74]There's plenty of people in the Discord.
[466:57.96]I really wish you the best, Tingy.
[467:01.38]Seriously.
[467:04.52]Hopefully, whatever you're going through, you... can figure out.
[467:08.55]That's all you can do, day to day, is just try to figure it out.
[467:10.99]Try to keep going forward.
[467:14.47]There's no magic way to solve problems.
[467:19.20]You solve problems by solving them.
[467:21.58]And that's it.
[467:22.32]And some problems are unsolvable.
[467:26.28]And it's trying to step around and piece together your life, you know, around problems that maybe are out of your control.
[467:40.64]I wish you the best of luck.
[467:43.42]There's plenty of people here that definitely would love to talk to you.
[467:52.23]And to wrap it up here, thank you Garfield the Monday Killer for the final quarter here.
[468:00.40]Hey Jerma Lerma Ding Dong, I just read an interview in a newspaper I had with my boss and he says that I'm John's favorite pet because he has masochistic tendencies.
[468:09.22]I've been doing this comic for nearly 39 years and I've just gotten that impression.
[468:13.74]Any advice for it?
[468:14.38]Do you guys hear how I'm just like monotonely reading through these now?
[468:19.98]Garfield the Monday Killer has sent like five pages worth of RP and at this point I'm just like reading through them.
[468:30.76]Is anybody else picking up on that?
[468:35.58]I'm just like saying the words out loud at this point.
[468:39.14]We've gotten at least like four pa- at least four pages of RP from Garfield the Monday Killer.
[468:48.49]Thanks for your 25 cents.
[468:52.21]And finally, MooBeansBoo, thanks for the $1.
[468:53.94]Here's another poem.
[468:54.58]Jeremy, but please don't stumble.
[468:55.92]Pee-pee, poo-poo, suck a fart out of my bumble.
[468:58.92]Bumbles?
[468:59.50]Oh, bum hole.
[469:04.70]Alright, that's it.
[469:06.44]I'll see you guys maybe this weekend.
[469:08.10]If not, then... Talix and I will probably be playing Far Cry 5 on Tuesday.
[469:16.18]Talix, you here?
[469:17.42]Still here?
[469:20.49]Far Cry 5, is that Tuesday?
[469:21.89]Are we doing that on Tuesday?
[469:23.53]What's the plan here?
[469:24.12]I'm not sure he's even here.
[469:31.72]We can wait, though.
[469:32.22]Let's see if he's still here.
[469:40.79]Release is on Tuesday, at least.
[469:42.91]Are we talking, like, Tuesday afternoon or something?
[469:45.69]We should try it.
[469:46.69]I don't know.
[469:47.69]We'll talk off-stream about it, but maybe we'll do that.
[469:51.83]At least maybe we will eventually.
[469:53.25]Tuesday's good.
[469:53.79]All right, so expect Tuesday, Far Cry 5 with Buddy Italics on the PC CD-ROM.
[470:05.31]But lastly, Tiggy again came in with another little bit of bits here.
[470:10.89]On a better note, I guess, if you've ever heard of the meal replacement drink called Soylent, here's a thought.
[470:17.15]If you can drink a drink as a meal and not a drink, can you eat a meal as a drink and not a meal?
[470:24.74]Hmm.
[470:30.68]I, uh, well, can you eat a meal as a drink and not a meal?
[470:37.08]I mean, you could... You could, like, mash up... What about mashed potatoes?
[470:41.90]Right?
[470:44.44]Mashed potatoes are essentially what you're describing here.
[470:49.65]Mashed potatoes are not a meal.
[470:50.99]I mean, they are a meal, but they're kind of a drink, too.
[470:52.85]They're really soupy and they're really... Mashed potatoes are a smoothie food.
[471:03.94]I don't think I understand the question.
[471:05.40]Ha ha ha!
[471:08.85]Seriously, like, wait.
[471:12.08]Boom!
[471:12.62]My, like, brain just blew up and I'm just ready to think, wait a minute, what am I even saying?
[471:15.98]It's been, like, eight hours.
[471:21.51]Trying to drink mashed potatoes.
[471:22.99]I don't know why I was thinking about, like, mashed potatoes, like, are really whipped up and they're smooth and they've been ripped apart and
[471:30.78]How mashed are the potatoes you're eating?
[471:32.40]Yeah, they're a little liquid.
[471:34.30]Oh, that would be disgusting.
[471:35.77]A liquid mashed potatoes is just somebody warming up milk and putting salt in it.
[471:40.33]That's it.
[471:40.99]That's the only difference.
[471:41.87]It's just salty milk is what it would... Okay, now I'm gonna puke if I keep going here.
[471:50.74]Alright, goodnight everybody.
[471:52.22]I'll see you all next week.
[471:55.54]Take care.
[471:55.94]Have a good rest of your weekend.
[471:57.32]Much love to you.
[471:59.36]Ta-ta.
[472:08.42]you
[472:37.78]Alright, hold on a second.
[472:38.44]Wait, we got one more from MooMeansMoo.
[472:39.90]And MooMeansMoo just said that his credit card is having problems.
[472:44.04]You are now banned from... You're banned from donating for at least 30 days.
[472:50.34]I'm giving you the donation ban.
[472:55.82]No more bits for 30 days.
[473:00.49]That's right from the horse's mouth.
[473:04.62]Thank you, MooMeansMoo, for your final dollar of March!
[473:10.00]But in all seriousness, Jeremiah, all dumb poems aside, I really appreciate the streams.
[473:13.86]I pretty much schedule my week around them at this point.
[473:16.17]They're truly always something to look forward to, be it chat or just watching you fuck up at video games for five hours straight.
[473:22.61]Seriously, it gives me something to look forward to.
[473:24.51]Love you in chat.
[473:25.87]This community is seriously a blessing.
[473:27.17]Hearts in chat.
[473:29.75]Follow the pineapple, says don't leave for a dollar.
[473:35.72]Thank you, Moo.
[473:36.14]You've been around for a long time, man.
[473:41.66]Appreciate it.
[473:45.16]You... Yeah, I... What can I say?
[473:48.24]Like, you guys... Everything is... Everything we do here... It's just... Why would I want to stop doing this?
[474:01.71]I look forward to this, too.
[474:06.61]More than you probably imagine.
[474:08.35]I love this shit.
[474:11.61]Sometimes, maybe sometimes... Yeah, obviously we're all people, right?
[474:13.83]We're all humans, right?
[474:14.55]I've said this like three times now.
[474:16.67]But... Sometimes I just kind of... It's just not there.
[474:19.43]It's hard sometimes to turn on a stream and want to like... Do something fun, maybe?
[474:25.04]Sometimes I'm just not feeling fun.
[474:28.56]Sometimes I'm not feeling like playing a game.
[474:30.05]It happens, but... 95% of the time, 99% of the time... It's something I look forward to every week.
[474:40.47]And we're almost at 8 hours.
[474:41.39]Yeah.
[474:43.29]We're not gonna see the big 8, though.
[474:46.67]Let it run until it gets to 8 hours.
[474:51.69]Streamer won't end the stream because he wants to see 8-0-0-0.
[474:54.85]No.
[474:55.19]I gotta go.
[474:55.59]I'm going to bed.
[474:56.03]It's 3 o'clock in the morning.
[475:00.65]Good night, everybody.
[475:01.33]I'll see you tomorrow.
[475:02.43]No, don't see you tomorrow.
[475:03.93]Why am I doing that?
[475:05.05]I'll see you when I see you next week.
[475:07.45]Either Monday or Tuesday.
