[00:01.55]I am the rocket man they talk about.
[00:04.65]I jump from star to star, I walk it out.
[00:07.48]Alright, so what team are you on right now?
[00:11.90]I don't know if I should go in here.
[00:13.78]I am on scout right now.
[00:17.56]Playing with the Soda Popper.
[00:19.48]Oh, I see how it is.
[00:20.34]Spy around here.
[00:28.99]Oh boy.
[00:30.43]I am toast.
[00:31.51]Spy ships.
[00:31.95]Spy ships.
[00:35.39]Wow.
[00:40.15]I'm gonna go with the... I'll go with this setup.
[00:44.35]Candy cane.
[00:44.83]Uh-oh.
[00:49.10]Oh no, you didn't.
[00:50.96]Oh no, you didn't.
[00:52.42]Oh yes, I did.
[00:55.10]So funny, I told this in a video I had before, but I never knew that you could... Oh, hold on.
[01:01.75]Serious time.
[01:02.73]Serious mode.
[01:06.81]Oh!
[01:07.75]Run away, run away!
[01:08.95]Oh, that damn medic.
[01:09.89]You got a damn... I love how people are probably just like, what are they doing?
[01:13.37]Oh, shit.
[01:15.53]There we go.
[01:15.91]Nice.
[01:17.91]I love the shield kills.
[01:18.95]Very satisfying.
[01:19.97]Oh, that was good.
[01:21.65]That was definitely a good one.
[01:23.58]But I never knew the candy cane.
[01:24.74]When you killed somebody with any of your weapons, it gave you the health back.
[01:28.07]I thought you had to actually smash people with it.
[01:30.47]No.
[01:31.71]I never knew that.
[01:33.81]Something could consider it a little unbalanced if you did it right.
[01:39.38]Yeah.
[01:41.34]The fact that the enemies can pick up the health, that makes it pretty fair.
[01:45.92]Difficult.
[01:46.34]Yeah.
[01:51.06]Oh man, I see this right side.
[01:52.82]I'm gonna get behind all these foes.
[01:55.94]Uh-oh.
[01:56.64]Harassing my medic.
[01:59.28]Do not approve your conduct, cut down.
[02:03.36]Oh, come on, Heavy.
[02:04.44]Oh, DJ.
[02:07.12]DJ.
[02:08.97]You good player, you.
[02:12.07]DJ doesn't mess around.
[02:16.84]Where did that guy come from?
[02:18.68]Damn it, pucks.
[02:19.34]That guy just died in my screen.
[02:21.80]I didn't even know from where.
[02:22.68]That's crazy.
[02:27.45]We got to get on this point.
[02:30.19]We got a shibby My Little Pony spray.
[02:32.43]That's something else.
[02:36.03]That's from Callum.
[02:37.57]I don't even know.
[02:38.25]I can't even begin to understand what that show is about or what it is.
[02:44.83]Yeah, people ask all the time, Shibby, are you a brony?
[02:47.41]I guess that's what you call, like, a My Little Pony fan, I think.
[02:51.19]I don't know.
[02:56.71]Oh, boy.
[02:57.45]I gotta get out of there.
[03:02.30]Nice sticky.
[03:04.26]Crap.
[03:09.32]Oh, you guys are gonna win.
[03:11.98]Somebody get on it.
[03:13.74]Let's do it!
[03:14.38]Get on it!
[03:15.42]Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[03:16.74]Oh, they listened.
[03:17.56]Nice.
[03:19.28]Oh, we're actually going to get it.
[03:22.11]Lobbing shots.
[03:26.89]Oh, come on!
[03:27.77]Come on!
[03:29.83]No!
[03:31.01]Dry man.
[03:33.45]Dry man with a long-range needle.
[03:35.94]Dryman who sent me a t-shirt of Shibby 2142.
[03:39.08]I mean, that's just something else.
[03:41.08]What a boss.
[03:41.94]That is awesome.
[03:42.84]I saw that.
[03:44.20]That was like a pro t-shirt.
[03:46.46]Yeah.
[03:47.42]Like he didn't just like draw like his name on it or something.
[03:50.30]No, that was like legitimate logos.
[03:53.06]Yeah.
[03:55.30]Definitely pretty damn cool.
[03:56.46]Yeah.
[03:59.11]Have you worn it anywhere yet?
[04:01.21]No, I think I'm going to save it for that special event I talked about earlier, which I'll probably announce later this week.
[04:08.55]Nice.
[04:09.63]Yeah.
[04:10.99]Uh-oh.
[04:14.89]Pause.
[04:15.65]Can we come back from being down to overtime and potentially win this?
[04:23.79]That's one reason I love King of the Hill.
[04:25.21]Like, anything can happen.
[04:27.25]Yeah, but it's my favorite game type by far.
[04:29.52]Yeah, it keeps the rounds, you know, fairly short.
[04:32.94]And usually someone has to win.
[04:34.56]It's not like a one-hour long two-fort.
[04:38.30]Yeah, 24-7 two-fort with a map time of 12 hours.
[04:40.12]Yeah.
[04:44.88]And, you know, no flag cap limit.
[04:46.86]So when you join, it's like 55 to 63 flag caps.
[04:50.86]Yeah.
[04:52.12]It's supposed to be three, right?
[04:53.78]Yeah.
[04:55.68]It's ridiculous.
[04:58.50]Oh, no.
[04:58.84]Alright, here we go.
[05:02.80]Oh, son.
[05:05.34]Oh, the Soda Popper.
[05:06.78]Jerma's getting off point.
[05:07.80]Time to get on it.
[05:09.44]Oh, son.
[05:10.78]No, no, no, no.
[05:12.90]I'm just going to jump around like a freak.
[05:17.11]Oh, God.
[05:18.35]No!
[05:19.55]Those assists.
[05:20.87]I got the assist.
[05:22.25]Oh, man, look at that.
[05:23.47]Oh, there we go.
[05:24.53]What a cheap bastard I am.
[05:27.37]I'm still saying, like, if you actually kill your opponent, it should be, like, three points, and assists should be, like, one.
[05:33.98]Come on, son.
[05:34.74]I agree.
[05:36.14]I do agree.
[05:36.64]Alright, let's go with... I'll try sniper here.
[05:42.18]I'm going to go...
[05:44.47]Engineer with the new Widowmaker.
[05:47.93]I tried that.
[05:48.55]It kind of worked.
[05:51.15]One thing that I kind of screwed up on was I was playing overly aggressive with the Mini-Sentry, which I probably shouldn't be doing.
[06:07.23]Yeah, there's talk that I guess it's a little overpowered now.
[06:10.90]There's the talk, I guess, talk of the town.
[06:13.76]I mean, perhaps.
[06:19.38]Shit.
[06:25.59]I can't snipe for anything right now.
[06:34.03]fallback uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh oh I almost got it almost got that John genuine Widowmaker yeah it is genuine in the game that I the genuine game the deus ex I've played it probably once and I was not happy you were not amused I was not amused oh god this medic is dancing around nice that was nice
[07:03.62]Alright, sniper's not happening.
[07:10.18]Game's got unbelievable graphics, but gameplay-wise, it was just a little too slow for my taste.
[07:16.07]A lot of people like it, but... Was there any multiplayer or no?
[07:19.47]No.
[07:20.67]It's kind of like a Metal Gear Solid first person with third person shooting elements.
[07:26.61]It's like an RPG Metal Gear Solid is what I saw it as.
[07:30.83]Oh, and nobody tells Shibby what's about to happen.
[07:35.34]Oh, come on.
[07:37.31]Someone get the assist.
[07:38.21]Someone get the assist.
[07:39.87]Oh, nope.
[07:40.63]Damn.
[07:40.97]Not yet.
[07:42.41]Yeah, I'm good to go.
[07:43.15]Let's focus on taking down that heavy.
[07:45.81]Oh, here we go.
[07:47.87]Fox in the cloud.
[07:59.04]Alright.
[08:03.28]These two roll together quite frequently, huh?
[08:05.02]Mr. Payne and Slice of Bread?
[08:06.42]Oh yeah, they're one and the same.
[08:09.28]You are 100 feet in the air right now.
[08:12.83]Two peas in a pod.
[08:19.29]I should probably... If I could, I'd forcibly remove one of them to the other team.
[08:24.07]Because it's just not fair.
[08:41.91]Gosh.
[08:44.61]Those two.
[08:47.67]17,000 minigun kills.
[08:50.98]Jesus.
[08:53.46]That's too much.
[08:55.80]You didn't get the assist for that?
[08:57.60]No, I never hit you.
[09:03.16]You were obliterated way too fast.
[09:10.64]See, I gotta get me a cool shibby spray.
[09:14.42]There you go.
[09:15.26]I gotta get me one of those.
[09:17.58]No!
[09:18.68]Run!
[09:19.36]Run away!
[09:19.84]Oh my god.
[09:21.56]Oh my gosh.
[09:22.38]Now you're sentry gun.
[09:23.46]Oh, I was gonna say, you're sentry gun.
[09:24.58]That's gonna get the assist.
[09:25.89]Nope.
[09:27.19]How'd you not die?
[09:28.23]I had three health.
[09:30.23]Wow.
[09:32.07]Natascha really not helped me out.
[09:33.57]Yeah, if you had any of the other miniguns, I probably would've died.
[09:38.49]Damn.
[09:42.45]Let's push the point and get this, though.
[09:44.83]Quit screwing around like a bunch of nubs.
[09:47.33]Now you're mine.
[09:48.66]Oh, yeah, there it is.
[09:52.50]Truly feared, Natascha.
[09:57.04]Eh, just kind of feared.
[09:59.44]Oh, man, you guys got on it.
[10:06.55]Sorry, I have confidence in the blue team.
[10:10.50]Oh, come on, Mr. Painslow.
[10:12.12]There it is.
[10:17.41]Oh boy, I'm dead.
[10:19.81]Got my paper hat.
[10:21.35]What do you know about that?
[10:23.85]I actually love that hat, to be honest.
[10:26.77]I think it's so great.
[10:27.77]Is there like a high-res version where you can actually read it, or no?
[10:31.85]I don't know.
[10:33.67]Let me take a look at it.
[10:34.79]I wonder if there's any good stuff on it.
[10:39.45]Yeah, it looks like there's a couple clippings there that if you were a whiz kid at graphic design, you might be able to zoom in on it, clear it up a little bit.
[10:47.00]Not sure, though.
