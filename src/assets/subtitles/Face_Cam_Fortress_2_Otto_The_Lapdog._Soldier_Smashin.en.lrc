[00:08.97]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.77]Jerma here.
[00:11.53]Wait a second, Otto.
[00:12.73]You have to make your camera debut.
[00:15.27]Jerma and Otto.
[00:16.59]And there's actually somebody else in this call.
[00:18.74]Go ahead and introduce yourself.
[00:20.80]Hi.
[00:21.24]Who's that?
[00:23.86]It's Boo.
[00:25.75]But yes, Otto wanted to say hello.
[00:29.19]You haven't had a checkup with Otto in a while.
[00:31.03]He's doing okay.
[00:32.97]See?
[00:34.03]He's got a good face.
[00:35.31]He's got a good white stripe.
[00:36.65]He's a good dog.
[00:37.93]He was actually lying down right here for a while.
[00:40.30]But yes, Space Game Fortress 2, this is Monday's edition.
[00:43.78]Hope you're having a fantastic month.
[00:44.86]I'm just standing still.
[00:46.20]Let me talk for five minutes.
[00:48.16]Just knock like...
[00:49.91]I have no idea who I killed, but they're dead.
[00:51.89]So Otto wanted to get down.
[00:53.13]He's down there now.
[00:54.45]And oh my god, what just even killed me?
[00:56.23]I don't even know.
[00:57.53]I don't even know.
[01:00.54]But we're on offense now.
[01:04.04]We are on the offense.
[01:06.36]And I changed what I was using.
[01:09.76]I want to get my...
[01:11.61]Scarcely Lethal.
[01:12.75]I think that's what it is.
[01:14.73]Scarcely Lethal... Why can't I not even think of the name of this weapon?
[01:18.15]The Liberty Launcher.
[01:19.71]Scarcely Lethal Gun.
[01:22.39]No!
[01:23.71]Hide.
[01:25.25]Watch the dead ring a spy behind us.
[01:26.74]Oh god, really?
[01:28.22]No, he's just a scout.
[01:29.34]Scout.
[01:30.68]Oh, I got him.
[01:31.48]Oh, is he truly dead, though?
[01:33.76]Yeah, I got a new rank on my pistol for it.
[01:36.30]Actually, does that work?
[01:37.86]Yeah.
[01:41.14]Oh, how did I not kill him?
[01:44.97]Very, very good.
[01:46.61]Is that actually like a Spy Jack, or does it fake that to your new rank on your weapon?
[01:51.57]I don't think it would fake that.
[01:53.21]That's something I would... That'd be very weird if it did.
[01:55.42]Spy is up top right here.
[01:57.98]Oh, I see him.
[01:59.16]I think he's dead.
[01:59.74]I don't know.
[02:00.24]No, he's not.
[02:01.00]He's actually, like, stuffed in this corner over here with me.
[02:03.96]And he got the health, too, that prickly bastard.
[02:09.30]Hey, there's a spy here.
[02:10.52]Watch it.
[02:10.84]Oh, I just picked up the ammo.
[02:11.92]I'm sorry, dude.
[02:12.80]It's Kaiser's energy.
[02:13.58]I got him.
[02:15.08]You got him?
[02:16.98]Yep.
[02:17.08]Okay, good.
[02:18.04]I'm gonna go put a tele-exit upstairs.
[02:20.21]God, we are absolutely rolling right now.
[02:24.23]Alright, black box soldier coming from the upstairs.
[02:26.51]Ooh, really?
[02:28.19]Yep.
[02:32.55]Yep.
[02:36.04]We have a friendly spy crabbing out of spawn, making his way through the field.
[02:41.73]Oh wait, we have a wild spy crab?
[02:43.31]Really?
[02:46.51]I didn't know we had a wild spy crab.
[02:49.14]That makes me happy.
[02:52.28]Alright, let's push this car.
[02:54.22]Nobody here.
[02:55.90]Oh, this is a heavy... I want to go back and just shoot that guy.
[02:59.67]He probably has no health.
[03:01.90]But there's nobody here, where is everybody?
[03:04.60]Oh my word, where's the sentry?
[03:07.82]Where's that sentry gun?
[03:08.83]Is it up top behind everybody?
[03:11.15]I don't see it.
[03:12.17]It must be up on the corridor.
[03:17.41]What does this take?
[03:23.53]I swear, that sentry is up here somewhere.
[03:28.95]Maybe I'm just crazy and it was a heavy behind me or something.
[03:31.13]No, it's definitely up here.
[03:32.67]Oh, whoa!
[03:35.81]They got a lot of things up here.
[03:38.19]Oh boy, oh my god.
[03:40.29]Oh my god.
[03:41.41]Screw the spy.
[03:42.63]We gotta take this stuff out.
[03:44.63]No!
[03:45.25]Liberty Launcher, this is not the good place for you.
[03:49.68]Ah, I got one sentry.
[03:53.62]Oh my god.
[03:56.20]Damn.
[03:58.04]Oh, we gotta...
[04:00.02]Just trying to wallbang this guy, come on.
[04:01.88]I got the other sentry.
[04:04.12]Oh, you got him.
[04:04.84]I got the NG.
[04:06.04]I got it.
[04:06.42]Sentry down.
[04:06.88]Oh, spy.
[04:07.62]Both of them down.
[04:08.46]Both sentry down, though.
[04:09.60]Two spies up there.
[04:10.62]Oh, there's a guy disguising me.
[04:14.89]If you see a Demoman, shoot him.
[04:16.49]What was that guy's name?
[04:17.29]Dr. Octomagopus?
[04:22.69]Rocket jump.
[04:23.89]Rocket jump.
[04:25.91]Right on top of the health.
[04:27.29]That was my plan, baby.
[04:30.30]Don't watch out, that medic, where you going?
[04:33.63]That medic... Oh man, that medic just backed up into hell.
[04:40.69]Ah, you bastard.
[04:45.17]Possibly a spy disguised as me, a Demoman.
[04:47.96]Okay.
[04:48.56]Oh, this is by disguised as a soldier.
[04:52.00]What?
[04:52.64]What?
[04:53.90]What the... Alright, I want everyone to go back and watch that.
[04:59.64]That guy, he was reloading, and it looked like he was putting his hand down on the dispenser to sap it.
[05:09.55]That was one of the oddest things I've ever seen.
[05:13.13]You stupid spy.
[05:15.85]You are not dead.
[05:16.55]That was ridiculous.
[05:23.52]Man, we gotta get a push here.
[05:25.60]We're just stuck in the alleyways.
[05:30.51]Get rid of all this garbage here.
[05:37.29]Heavy medic and a pyro coming as well through the tunnel.
[05:40.35]I got the pyro.
[05:43.10]Oh, a spy.
[05:44.72]Man, they don't really have anything here, do they?
[05:46.36]They just drop down.
[05:49.28]Get on this cart.
[05:50.40]Get on this cart.
[05:51.18]Push it, baby.
[05:51.70]Push it.
[05:52.84]You've got to push it.
[05:54.93]You've got to push it.
[05:57.27]Heavy medic and pyro on the bridge.
[06:00.71]That medic is insane.
[06:01.99]What's he doing?
[06:03.79]Nothing I could do there.
[06:04.61]I got one kill.
[06:06.79]It's almost there.
[06:07.69]It's almost there.
[06:09.43]We're getting closer.
[06:10.62]Oh, no.
[06:10.96]I'm out of coffee.
[06:17.12]Four and a half minutes.
[06:17.98]We got this, Boop.
[06:20.87]Center's gone down, I'll change from demo.
[06:22.99]Oh, my phone's ringing.
[06:25.23]Oh, my phone's always just ringing.
[06:27.79]It's either Burgah Boy or, like, Mama Jerm.
[06:32.61]Oh, where you going?
[06:34.89]Where you going?
[06:37.66]I'm just gonna club this guy right in the face!
[06:42.30]I kinda did.
[06:44.08]We're gonna get it, we're gonna get it, this is it!
[06:47.40]Oh, don't open me on the cart!
[06:49.64]Nice.
[06:51.76]Nice job, team.
[06:52.56]Good job, dudes.
[06:57.62]Yeah.
[06:57.74]Alright, well, that's going to wrap it up here for Facecam Fortress 2, Monday's edition.
[07:03.71]Boo, thanks for joining me.
[07:05.17]I'm looking at the camera.
[07:06.25]I don't even know where I'm looking, but thanks for joining me, Boo.
[07:09.09]Always a pleasure.
[07:10.29]And thanks, everyone else, for joining me as well, and Boo.
[07:13.73]So, see you guys next time, and of course, take care, everybody.
[07:17.70]Where's Otto?
[07:18.64]Otto, you have to say bye.
[07:21.52]Otto, come here.
[07:24.90]Otto, come here.
[07:28.94]He was just like... Oh, I just... Otto, I'm sorry.
[07:35.23]Goodbye, everybody.
[07:36.15]Thanks for watching Facecam Fortress 2.
[07:40.07]My name is Otto.
[07:42.69]Look, look at how tired he is.
