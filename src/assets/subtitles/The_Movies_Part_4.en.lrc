[15:35.93]I want to know what this is.
[15:49.14]I don't know what this is.
[15:50.04]Let me go back to that.
[15:57.74]Hold on.
[15:58.02]Give me one second.
[16:02.40]One second.
[16:29.37]Alright.

[16:39.40]Alright.
[16:39.74]No, no, I didn't want him falling into boxes right here.
[16:41.92]This is going to change.
[16:43.66]Commercial streak.
[16:48.41]So you guys thought it was going to be a crash, but it's actually a drive-by.
[16:50.87]That's so fucking stupid.
[16:59.10]Slow, fast, fast.
[17:02.72]How would you even know what you were shooting at?
[17:04.18]That's so wild.
[17:09.70]That is so wild.
[17:11.28]That's just out of fucking control.
[17:16.83]Alright, it's gotta be... This is Enclave, right?
[17:20.05]That's gonna be a monster.
[17:29.08]No, this isn't Enclave.
[17:35.24]Alright, that's like an orc right there, right?
[17:45.43]Is there a good orc?
[17:47.07]There it is.
[17:47.49]There's the orc.
[17:58.64]Wait, what?
[18:04.44]I didn't... Fireproof stunt suit.
[18:13.02]Uh...

[18:17.01]I wish I could throw a knife out the window or something.
[18:19.15]Alright.
[18:29.40]I wish you could have somebody drive through a building.
[18:40.81]The car's where it was again.
[18:41.77]You guys all think it's going to be like a car accident.
[18:45.97]Nope.
[18:51.47]We're actually going to move the camera here to somewhere different.
[19:00.63]Let's go down.
[19:01.39]There we go.
[19:08.50]Right here, right?
[19:15.01]Is it shift or is it... There we go.

[19:43.01]And you gotta set it.
[19:45.13]Immersion ruined.
[19:49.07]Slightly.
[19:49.83]Only slightly, though.
[19:53.49]There we go.
[19:58.95]That car's got to change to the right car.
[20:03.86]No, that's the wrong car.
[20:07.16]This one.
[20:07.54]Okay.
[20:17.19]Is this a ding stream?
[20:18.31]Yeah, we're doing all kinds of dings.
[20:28.78]Alright, make sure that works.
[20:34.84]Yep.

[24:10.53]They didn't even hit the fucking thing.
[24:11.97]Hold on.
[24:12.37]Wait, wait.
[24:12.87]I need to see.
[24:14.69]I need to fucking chase this.
[24:17.13]There might be something better.

[24:43.70]Alright, is it a couch or is it a car?
[24:48.84]Yeah, we'll keep the horse.

[25:04.70]Alright, where does it need to be?
[25:06.26]Right here?
[25:06.62]No, it's because the horse has to be lying down on the road.
[25:16.81]How do I, like, move this horse?
[25:19.39]How do I, like, rotate it?
[25:20.29]I don't know how you, like, row.

[92:22.92]But yeah, just a little couple hour impromptu stream.
[92:26.14]I just felt like doing something.
[92:31.14]I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[92:34.01]And I don't know what the fuck.
[92:35.01]I'll have to plan something for Tuesday.
[92:36.29]Dude, this part of that fucking slayed me.
[92:45.75]Yeah, I just felt like turning the stream on for a little bit.
[92:50.22]Before I go, though, thank you to... There's a few people I need to thank.
[92:55.94]Oh, I'm gonna, like, puke.
[92:58.24]Thank you to Jake for the 500 bits.

[93:05.49]Also, thank you for $5 from Frisky Moose.
[93:07.03]Are you trying to make me throw up laughing?
[93:10.68]No, I'm not trying.
[93:11.62]It's just this game is so fucking funny.
[93:14.59]Thank you, Great Lord Walden, for the five bucks as well.

[93:27.27]And for the subs, we had Pie Loaded Shotgun for two months.

[93:43.12]Oh, thanks a lot, dude.
[93:43.94]You're... You are... Whatever.
[93:46.29]I... I don't know.
[93:47.81]I can't pronounce your name.

[94:10.73]Thanks a lot, guys.
[94:13.52]I think that's it.
[94:15.56]Thanks a lot, everybody.

[94:22.81]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[94:24.45]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[94:26.75]Much love, everybody.
[94:29.15]Actually, hold on a second.
[94:30.73]I want to address something before I leave.
[94:32.96]It's something that I haven't been able to.
[94:34.32]I keep saying I want to address it, and it's something that I wasn't able to for a while.
[94:38.23]But I'm going to right now.
[94:40.97]And it's actually pretty emotional.
[94:45.32]Because...
[94:48.19]It dates back to like five years ago, pretty much.
[94:51.67]But I've been wanting to bring this up for like a week.
[94:55.07]And I'm going to bring it up right now.
[94:58.34]So like the TF2 comic came out a couple weeks ago, right?
[95:03.56]And apparently the scout in TF2 is named Jeremy.
[95:10.00]And that's, I mean, maybe purely by coincidence, right?
[95:13.93]Purely by coincidence.
[95:15.37]It could be, right?
[95:15.93]That's probably the case.
[95:16.99]I'm not going to say that they, like, oh, they named the scout after me.
[95:19.91]But...
[95:21.31]There was a huge response to people sending me messages and people talking about how they were excited that my name was the Scout's name and shit like that.
[95:32.58]I just want to say from the bottom of my fucking heart, that is so humbling and so... I have no words to describe how people are happy that I share my name with that character.
[95:47.87]And if they did, then that's extremely cool and kind and awesome of Valve to do.
[95:53.63]But even if it's just purely by coincidence, it's just purely by coincidence, right?
[95:59.23]That's still awesome.
[96:00.41]And I'm still happy that that many people care about that.
[96:05.69]And like TF2, I owe everything to that game.
[96:12.43]I owe so much to that game.
[96:13.65]Like, that game changed my fucking entire life.
[96:16.75]So... For you guys to be, like, sending me all those nice messages about it, it's like... It is something special.
[96:30.10]And I just wanted to address it because I haven't been able to.
[96:35.25]And even if, like I said, it's purely by coincidence...
[96:38.65]You guys are fucking awesome.
[96:39.87]I got so many messages.
[96:41.26]The response was fucking huge about it.
[96:44.76]So I love that community.
[96:46.24]I love you guys.
[96:50.84]And I'll talk to you on Tuesday.
[96:54.99]Take care.
[96:56.09]See you soon.
[97:08.98]you
[97:52.70]I'm sorry.
