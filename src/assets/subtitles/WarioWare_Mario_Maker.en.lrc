[00:46.38]What's this about being late?
[00:49.94]I'm like 40 minutes early.
[00:51.80]What are you guys on?
[00:52.94]What are you guys smoking?
[00:55.50]Whatever it is, stop.
[00:56.94]Smoking's not good for you.
[01:03.90]Hi.
[01:07.38]Channel's not live yet.
[01:08.14]Yeah, it is.
[01:09.68]Don't you see the orbiting moon?
[01:13.60]My fellas?
[01:14.57]My friends?
[01:20.47]Hopefully I have my camera set up correctly.
[01:22.27]Alright, give me one more second, guys.
[01:31.74]I'll be right back.
[02:21.05]Okay.
[02:21.51]Let's just see here.
[02:24.94]Let's see, are we in frame?
[02:29.36]Can you see me?
[02:32.84]I hope so.
[02:35.13]Oh, hi there!
[02:35.91]Hi!
[02:35.97]Yeah, it's me, Jerma.
[02:37.93]You know, your friend.
[02:39.11]Your family member.
[02:42.05]Yeah, we're doing a face scan tonight.
[02:43.67]Just because I get it, fucking people won't leave me goddamn alone to do it, so.
[02:47.49]We're gonna do it!
[02:49.45]Apparently.
[02:49.95]We're gonna play WarioWare.
[02:58.15]Am I like too far to the right?
[02:59.27]Or too far to the left?
[03:00.66]I can't, I can't fucking tell.
[03:04.50]He's so small.
[03:06.30]I'm compact!
[03:11.34]By the way, I should probably address this right now.
[03:14.38]I can't see if you're sending, like, bits or if you're subbing.
[03:18.74]It's over there.
[03:20.06]And I had to, like, get back and put my ship down so you could actually see me on camera.
[03:23.96]So, I can barely read the chat right now.
[03:28.44]So, it's gonna be hard.
[03:29.84]It's gonna be difficult to actually, like, do anything on this stream besides play the game.
[03:34.01]I'm just gonna warn you.
[03:36.91]Hopefully, I can get this right.
[03:42.67]Right there, maybe?
[03:46.71]This is gonna be fucking hard.
[03:49.19]Well, just know that if you're gonna fucking give bits- There's a bright ass light over here, too.
[03:53.88]I hate this.
[03:54.90]I fucking- I hate this light.
[03:56.98]I want you guys to place your bets.
[03:58.00]We're gonna take a little Q&A here.
[04:00.82]Q&A, no.
[04:01.64]Alright, so anyways.
[04:03.56]See this?
[04:04.56]See under here?
[04:06.88]It is so hot in this room because of this light that- Place your bets.
[04:09.56]When am I gonna start sweating through this fucking shirt?
[04:12.90]It's gonna happen in like 20 minutes.
[04:14.42]I'm gonna be like a drenched fucking dirt ball in like fucking 20 or 30 minutes.
[04:18.37]I swear to God.
[04:21.07]Early bird gets the bits.
[04:23.25]Thank you, Dr. Jensen.
[04:25.53]I could see that one.
[04:27.05]I could see that one.
[04:32.95]I'm telling you right now, it's not even a joke.
[04:35.03]This is gonna get fucking... I don't do well under lights and bright... playing WarioWare.
[04:41.39]It's gonna get intense.
[04:45.04]You guys can see my fucking fucked up face.
[04:47.28]I've been live for four minutes, that's right.
[04:53.20]You never wear long sleeves.
[04:54.28]It's cold!
[04:55.00]It's like fucking winter time here, man.
[04:57.07]Alright.
[05:03.19]Take it off.
[05:03.69]I can't do that.
[05:04.45]I'll get banned for life.
[05:06.29]Alright, let's go.
[05:06.71]We're gonna try to beat... Am I too far over here?
[05:09.63]Is that better?
[05:11.09]We're gonna beat WarioWare.
[05:11.83]We're gonna play the shit out of WarioWare until I'm satisfied.
[05:17.12]Tiny sweaty streamer is mad.
[05:20.22]Will, alright, remind me in 20 minutes because this is coming off.
[05:24.16]No, I mean like this is the arms coming off.
[05:27.28]I'm not good on camera.
[05:28.74]I'm not good on camera unless there's a script involved.
[05:30.94]You understand?
[05:31.62]There's no script involved here.
[05:33.08]I don't like, I don't do well on this camera.
[05:39.11]This is why I like to have it off.
[05:41.19]Because I can't like make my dumb jokes because I make like fucked up faces.
[05:45.69]Let's just play.
[05:46.69]Fuck it.
[05:51.83]Is the mic... Can you hear when my mouth is moving?
[05:55.59]Ready?
[05:57.33]Is it synced up?
[05:58.63]It took me a long time to figure this shit out.
[06:08.96]Is it active?
[06:10.94]Look, I love being on camera.
[06:12.28]I love making skits when I'm prepared.
[06:18.58]This is all live and unprepared.
[06:20.10]I'm not a prepared person.
[06:22.91]I'm very unprepared.
[06:23.87]And what?
[06:24.29]Oh.
[06:25.95]Sorry.
[06:26.29]This is the dog, right?
[06:29.48]That's good?
[06:35.42]Base cam is late?
[06:36.46]Shouldn't be.
[06:36.88]Nothing I can fucking do about it now.
[06:45.49]Hey, you guys ready to watch this?
[06:49.09]Am I in the way?
[06:49.67]Is the camera in the way?
[06:52.08]Is it too big?
[06:52.72]Am I too small?
[06:53.74]How big am I?
[06:54.32]Hey, how big am I?
[06:56.66]You know what I'm saying?
[07:03.18]I need to talk to you.
[07:03.82]It's important.
[07:04.36]Well, let's go!
[07:06.85]Don't forget the straps.
[07:08.53]We're going fucking strapless.
[07:10.33]I don't give a shit.
[07:13.23]A little bit bigger?
[07:13.95]You guys want it bigger.
[07:18.09]What?
[07:18.83]Hold on.
[07:22.82]Where am I going to put it?
[07:24.66]That's like too big.
[07:27.62]You guys aren't going to see the wacky shit on WarioWare.
[07:30.78]Better?
[07:31.02]Should I move?
[07:36.74]Keep it full size.
[07:37.82]Alright, here we go.
[07:43.85]Remote control, you got it.
[07:49.19]Easy fucking game.
[07:52.98]That's it, I win!
[07:55.89]Is it too big?
[07:57.39]Half the screen?
[07:59.99]No!
[08:00.41]That's fucking terrible.
[08:06.36]It's kinda too big.
[08:08.98]Fuck!

[08:11.20]Yeah, that's what I do on every Monday, Tuesday.
[08:22.22]Abduct.
[08:33.61]Oh shit, I don't wanna make it that big.
[08:34.83]I got like a zit today.
[08:36.59]I don't want you guys to see that.
[08:37.57]I should probably shrink it again.
[08:38.81]Can you see it?
[08:40.11]Fucking zit.
[08:40.53]Should've used proactive.
[08:53.09]Easy.

[09:03.48]Beat the fucking person, come on.
[09:06.06]I'm gonna do the left-handed.
[09:14.15]I thought it was a freckle.
[09:15.47]Nah, that's a fucking zit, dude.
[09:17.53]That is a big-ass fucking zit.
[09:20.56]Hold the form baton with both hands as you would a mop.
[09:24.94]Wrong form.
[09:29.96]Proactive?
[09:30.44]I have to disclose paid endorsements?
[09:32.42]I don't even use proactive.

[25:11.05]It just, like, didn't understand that I was here.
[25:20.97]Why did I put it in my ear?
[25:26.05]Why did I put it in my ear?
[25:30.76]Whoops.
[25:37.16]Whoops.
[25:41.84]It's on.
[25:42.18]The strap is on.
[25:42.92]I'm not gonna fail this.
[25:50.14]I won't lose.
[25:54.86]I'm not going to lose.
[26:19.46]I gotta back, the problem is I gotta fucking back up.
[26:31.23]I think I'm in a good spot now, but yeah, can you guys hear me?
[26:34.11]It's not gonna get picked up, I didn't fucking think this through at all.
[26:36.37]This is what I was taught, this room is small and I got nowhere to go, this is not good for a Wii house.
[26:49.69]You thought I was bad at Mario Maker.
[26:52.73]Rear.
[26:53.79]Project with your diaphragm.
[27:06.96]This is much better.
[27:07.70]Okay.
[27:08.50]I'll be back here.
[27:10.03]See you back here.
[27:11.41]Don't worry about me.
[27:13.01]Although I can't like read what you guys are saying and I can't see subs and shit.
[27:15.99]Like, oh well.
[27:16.99]Alright, here we go.
[27:17.53]Discard, right?
[27:21.21]I did it again.
[27:22.41]I don't know why.
[27:26.57]I didn't even need to put... Okay, I got it wrong.
[27:28.35]I'm confused.
[27:36.17]You don't know what this game is?
[27:37.19]You don't know what WarioWare is?
[27:41.74]WarioWare is like one of the greatest Wii games ever made.
[27:44.54]One of the greatest Nintendo games.
[27:46.50]I love this shit.
[27:53.21]My eyesight sucks, it does.
[27:54.33]I have terrible eyesight.
[27:57.92]I'm actually supposed to wear glasses 24-7, but I don't.
[28:01.48]At all.
[28:05.00]I refuse, because I hate them.
[28:06.76]I got like a crooked fucking nose.
[28:09.06]I got a... They don't fit my face in.
[28:13.54]I don't like... They get in the way and I can see the peripheral not...
[28:18.30]I just... I just fucking break dogs.
[28:20.49]I'm like being an idiot.
[28:23.69]You never get the turn ones to work well.
[28:27.13]Spaghetti!
[28:47.34]Get a nose job?
[28:48.26]No.
[28:49.48]No fucking way.
[28:50.58]Hey, it makes me unique.
[28:54.30]Alright, I'm not moving around that much.
[28:58.50]You guys can see my hand, right?
[29:01.68]I am perfectly still.
[29:11.63]Dude, I got a crooked nose.
[29:14.03]I got a fucked up face, dude.
[29:15.89]I...
[29:17.35]I don't need to, if I, you know, if I fix one problem, like, let's just say I go, like, oh, I don't like my face.
[29:22.05]I need to change my nose.
[29:23.57]I gotta fix my nose, I don't like it.
[29:26.29]Then, like, something else is gonna be wrong.
[29:27.67]Something else will be off after I do that.
[29:29.84]And then I gotta, like, I gotta, like, shave down my, like, eyebrow bones.
[29:32.88]And then after that, my chin's a little too long.
[29:34.76]What am I gonna do about that?
[29:37.82]No.
[29:38.78]Hey, God made you the way you are.
[29:42.02]Fucking stay that way.
[29:55.75]Grow a beard?
[29:57.01]I can't grow a beard.
[29:58.41]That's not gonna happen.
[30:00.81]If I don't... If I let this hair grow for... Like seven days.
[30:06.10]It just looks like shit.
[30:07.40]And if I let it go for... I've tried before to let it like, okay, get through the initial stage where... It looks like shit, right?
[30:14.21]I've done that.
[30:15.05]And then it just looks like somebody like stuffed me full of straw.
[30:17.73]And I gotta get rid of it.
[30:18.67]It looks terrible.
[30:21.31]I can't grow... No, I can't grow a beard.
[30:22.46]I just can't.
[30:23.90]I get like a 5 o'clock shadow and then it turns to dog shit.
[30:26.52]And then I have to get rid of it.
[30:30.04]Just wear a mask.
[30:32.92]Wait, what?
[30:36.34]What did we open up?
[30:37.73]New shit.
[30:38.15]Oh, sweat check!
[30:38.85]Uh-oh!
[30:41.29]No, we're still okay.
[30:42.81]We're still alright.
[30:43.37]How long have we been going for?
[30:45.05]Like 40 minutes?
[30:45.59]30 minutes?
[30:47.71]I'm actually surprised.
[30:48.47]I thought I was going to be soaking wet after that.
[30:55.89]Dogshit beard stream.
[31:01.05]Oh, subs!
[31:01.67]Right, I have a chance to, like, lean in here and read them.
[31:03.43]I'm such a fucking... Ugh, I'm so sorry, guys.
[31:08.53]Uh, Poké, thanks for three months.
[31:09.87]CopperEyes, thanks for three months.
[31:12.36]DylanDog1999, thanks for two months.
[31:14.30]MillsBrand.
[31:16.14]Sell me more shirts per month.
[31:17.44]I need to put it back in the holster shirt and a coffee Cheetos chicken shirt.
[31:22.12]Well, there's a new shirt that's coming.
[31:24.46]I think I've talked about it before, like maybe once or twice.
[31:27.43]But thank you, Potsy, as well, for the sub.
[31:29.75]I'm gonna scroll down here to... Nope, not yet.
[31:32.75]Every time I try.
[31:36.45]Wait, what?
[31:38.72]Do I lift?
[31:39.96]I used to.
[31:40.40]I'm actually trying to get back into the gym.
[31:43.16]I worked out earlier.
[31:45.74]You know, like, lifting and shit.
[31:47.02]I'm working out right now, see?
[31:49.54]This is, like, easily fucking four ounces.
[32:05.60]Alright, I didn't know what the hell that wanted me to do.
[32:19.49]Oh, remote control!
[32:20.25]I used to do it when I watched TV!
[32:21.79]I do this.
[32:22.23]Alright, time to pay attention.
[32:29.32]Time to pay attention.
[32:35.88]Aww, why are you farting in my face?
[32:42.58]Wait, which way does he go?
[32:43.20]Oh, that way.
[32:43.68]Okay.
[32:46.14]Okay, I thought he was a crab, and then I found out he was a scorpion.
[33:01.67]Okay, it's getting a little more intense.
[33:02.97]I'm gonna have to, like, really, I have to pay attention.
[33:17.42]No, I'm still hitting them.
[33:20.60]Raise your eggs.
[33:28.16]Do the diaper throw.
[33:29.00]That's the best way to go bowling.
[33:30.62]I still bowl like that sometimes.
[33:32.70]And you gotta get, like, the sure thing.
[33:39.99]By the way, this is on Wii U. You actually...
[33:44.71]You can buy this on Wii U, you don't have to play the Wii one.
[33:47.27]Did they upgrade it?
[33:48.27]Is it like 1080p?
[33:50.85]I guess it is, huh?
[33:52.11]Maybe they upscaled it, I don't know.
[33:54.01]But I have the Wii version and I have the Wii U version.
[33:58.91]You don't have to go like into the, you saw, you don't have to go like into the Wii.
[34:01.03]Got you, you little shit!
[34:09.97]What's with the, why are we seeing, what's with the eggs?
[34:11.27]Why do we get so many eggs?
[34:15.16]Oh shit.
[34:32.59]This is fucking embarrassing.
[34:34.29]I don't think I- I don't even need to do that.
[34:37.56]Just getting too into it.
[34:46.67]Okay, fuck it.
[34:47.43]I do have to do it.
[34:48.11]Do I have to shake my ass, too, like that?
[34:56.42]I did it.
[35:00.50]This is fucking so dumb.
[35:03.85]Like, it's the sensor bot that's doing this right now.
[35:05.87]It doesn't even, like, see it.
[35:22.33]This is why you guys want it, this is why you guys wanted it!
[35:24.59]You wanted the fucking facecam for this stupid reason!
[35:27.99]To see me, like, fucking run in place!
[35:30.10]I'm so scared!
[35:44.97]I want to do as little effort to get this to move as possible.
[35:48.43]I fucking hate this.
[35:56.12]I'm not even sure what I need to be doing.
[35:59.90]Am I doing it right?
[36:01.18]What the fuck is that move?
[36:12.55]Got it.
[36:16.67]Insecure dancing.
[36:26.24]Well, there it is.
[36:32.67]Clap, clap.
[36:34.29]How we doing?
[36:35.57]Ah!
[36:36.45]Yeah.
[36:39.13]Saved.
[36:39.57]I know.
[36:40.57]I was moving my arms in random directions.
[36:43.78]Thank you, dead boy.
[36:44.52]A Criken?
[36:47.10]Criken.
[36:47.52]Did I just beat the game?
[36:52.46]I did.
[36:53.20]Criken, I beat the game.
[36:56.93]But, hey, Criken, thanks for the sub.
[36:58.87]Welcome, dude.
[37:00.71]Uh, Beefcake Crunch, thank you for the two months.
[37:07.15]Oh, now we're gonna get, like, a fucking gif of that shit.
[37:09.84]Can't wait.
[37:14.58]Criken, Criken, yeah, is that the real Criken?
[37:17.00]What's up, dude?
[37:20.86]You make videos and stuff.
[37:27.42]That's not the end, by the way.
[37:28.70]We're not even close to the end.
[37:32.80]What about the bits?
[37:33.74]Have I missed a bunch of... Dr. Jensen gave a thousand bits.
[37:35.86]It says, shake it, Jerm ball.
[37:39.43]I did.
[37:39.95]I tried my best.
[37:43.23]Make the gif.
[37:46.67]Thank you, Dr. Jensen.
[37:47.49]Thank you also to Sam.
[37:48.69]Sam, again.
[37:49.35]Sam, you give money every stream.
[37:51.97]And you're a mod.
[37:53.43]Is there anything that you, like, don't do?
[37:56.55]Wear your dumbass glasses, then your old man transformation will soon be complete.
[37:59.79]Eh.
[38:00.35]Eh.
[38:01.09]Eh.
[38:01.15]That ain't gonna happen.
[38:04.24]Any more, like, large ones that I missed?
[38:06.74]Beepsu, thanks for the 200.
[38:10.96]Thanks a lot, guys.
[38:11.64]You guys rock.
[38:13.36]I'll catch the subs that I missed earlier.
[38:15.12]Of course, we're gonna go to Mei.
[38:16.92]This is like Mei.
[38:18.42]This is the Mei character.
[38:19.84]You'll see.
[38:20.22]Oh, we need the fucking balance stone.
[38:29.52]You just bought Sorcery, Psychoblade?
[38:30.74]It's a fucking fantastic game.
[38:33.16]It's like one of the best series I think I've ever played.
[38:36.42]It's just everything about it's fun.
[38:37.70]There's tons of shit to do.
[38:39.10]There's lots of fucking choices and stuff.
[38:40.92]Much, much to do in Sorcery.
[38:44.43]Glad you picked it up.
[38:47.73]Accidentally rewound to the start of the game though.
[38:49.39]Wow.
[38:51.71]That's not good.
[38:52.39]We got both in our hands now.
[38:57.25]We're ready to do this.
[39:03.02]But thanks a lot.
[39:03.84]Thanks a lot, guys.
[39:05.51]Time for a high five thanks to the sub.
[39:10.51]Now let's go... I missed a bunch at the very beginning of the stream.
[39:15.91]Jarl D. Clan, thanks for two months.
[39:18.00]Curly Snail...
[39:21.47]Gerald Talk.
[39:22.59]Thank you Gerald Talk.
[39:23.39]Nacknude123.
[39:24.83]They say hi, hi.
[39:26.83]I'm gonna like burp in the microphone.
[39:29.57]We'll make sure we get that like live on camera.
[39:33.76]Chicken CK, or Chicken CKN, thanks for the sub.
[39:38.90]Freckle Reckle, thank you for the sub.
[39:40.96]Wait, wait, wait.
[39:45.27]Okay, I gotta stand back.
[39:49.43]Diner.
[39:52.06]Don't drop.
[39:52.58]I didn't drop it.
[39:57.34]It didn't even... A million bits?
[40:07.85]Somebody gave a million bits.
[40:09.85]Oh shit, hold on.
[40:11.94]Don't drop.
[40:12.50]Alright, I get it.
[40:18.06]Who gave... Hold on, I gotta see that.
[40:22.31]Who gave it?
[40:23.81]Mittens!
[40:24.71]Mittens 98.98 with a hundred fucking bucks.
[40:27.44]Thanks a lot, Mittens.
[40:28.36]They say 100,000, 1,000 billion bits.
[40:37.86]That's... What time is it?
[40:39.90]I don't know.
[40:40.30]I can't tell time.
[40:43.90]That's a huge deal, dude.
[40:45.02]Thank you guys.
[40:47.85]Match two and three?
[40:51.27]Anytime you guys give me money like that, I just don't know what to say.
[40:54.05]It's fucking a ton of money.
[41:00.82]but it's incredibly humbling to know that somebody wants to pay me that much money.
[41:05.24]It's unbelievable.
[41:07.80]Thank you so much.
[41:13.03]Trillion.
[41:17.59]It's me!
[41:17.85]See, I told you this was about me.
[41:20.93]Good job.
[41:32.85]I can't tell time.
[41:39.64]What happened?
[41:41.81]I drove into like a little stake?
[42:02.71]Got him.
[42:04.51]You know, I should get punch out.
[42:05.83]Didn't they make a punch out for the Wii?
[42:08.88]Oh, that sounds like a fucking fun time.
[42:13.36]I'm gonna get punch out for the Wii.
[42:14.94]And then we're gonna play it.
[42:16.14]Not tonight, but we'll play it.
[42:17.62]That sounds like something that I'd probably want to do.
[42:19.16]There's me!
[42:24.07]Pay attention.
[42:24.79]I'm like, I'm distracted.
[42:26.81]I know, I'm like trying to read the chat.
[42:37.08]Speaking of distracted.
[42:40.21]Thank you, Abadoba, for the sub.
[42:42.65]Alright, let's go back down here and recognize the people from, like, fucking an hour ago.
[42:49.45]Besides Freckle Reckle, The Many Chins, El Mushroom, and Davey Coxie.
[42:54.36]Thanks, guys.
[42:56.72]And then Implode, Time for a High Five, and Abadoba.
[43:00.26]Right there.
[43:01.00]Thanks a lot, guys.
[43:03.26]All mixed up.
[43:04.16]Dr. Crygor.
[43:05.06]Let's do this one.
[43:09.04]Play 9-Volt.
[43:09.66]I want to get them all unlocked and then we're going to try to get at least 30 to 50 points on every single one.
[43:16.40]I probably shouldn't have just said that.
[43:18.52]Because it might not fucking work.
[43:23.51]Sweat check!
[43:27.43]It's alright.
[43:27.95]It's okay.
[43:28.47]It hasn't really started yet.
[43:32.49]Hasn't really started yet.
[43:35.28]Sweat.
[43:35.76]The thing is, it's gonna be like real embarrassing when that actually has like a lot of sweat underneath it, and I'm gonna feel like a fucking psycho.
[43:44.34]Gonna be like, oh, that's fucking gross.
[43:47.26]Great.
[43:53.65]It's like Wario's fucking twin brother.
[43:58.52]Minkfur just gave 3,000 bits.
[44:00.70]I just got a 142-gallon fish tank.
[44:03.52]And thoughts on what to put in it?
[44:04.68]I was thinking a pig-nosed turtle.
[44:08.05]Pig-nosed turtle, Minkfur.
[44:09.89]I... You gotta get a, uh... One of those, like, Oscar fishes.
[44:15.33]What was it?
[44:17.31]Oscar?
[44:18.75]One of those things, like the big Oscar fish?
[44:21.16]Or, you know... Sorry.
[44:22.48]Let me break that down for a second for you guys.
[44:25.04]I'm saying Oscar fish because...
[44:30.13]Okay, I got it.
[44:31.43]One of my friends had a fish, and the fish's name was Oscar.
[44:35.01]So, don't take anything I say seriously, because I'm fucking, I'm adorable.
[44:40.56]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[44:49.28]Still fucked it up.
[44:53.86]Wait, what?
[45:04.14]Come on!
[45:05.76]Burn those calories!
[45:06.90]The ones where you have to go forward and backwards are gonna be hard for me just because... I'm too close.
[45:29.25]Ooh!
[45:29.85]You like that move?
[45:31.51]That was a pretty slick move, I will say.
[45:38.09]Give me the coins!
[45:39.81]Oh, this is, this is, uh, this is something.
[45:44.13]Alright, janitor.
[46:06.74]I didn't, I didn't even hit it.
[46:08.46]I didn't even swing at it.
[46:11.61]I didn't even swing at it, that was bullshit.
[46:25.37]Oh god, Verilik.
[46:27.65]Verilik gave 50 bucks.
[46:33.69]Once I get through Dr. Calvin's fucking secret lair, hold on.
[46:43.27]Or a left handlebar.
[46:47.70]Could have had that immediately, but I just fucked it up.
[46:56.52]I just got...
[47:14.43]It's just not, it's not registering.
[47:17.97]It's just not registering, but now it is.
[47:19.67]Oh yeah, look at how good I look right there.
[47:33.76]Scrawny!
[47:35.16]Something wrong?
[47:35.80]Oh yes, the diet.
[47:40.04]Cheater.
[47:42.84]I unlocked a new place, that's all I care about.
[47:48.78]Oh, let's go.
[47:49.96]These are like just little toys, right?
[47:55.50]All mixed up.
[47:56.72]Let's go for it.
[47:58.00]This one is just, okay, this is where it just gets hard.
[48:00.52]Okay, I'm gonna shut up now.
[48:03.92]Time to be quiet and time to win, you know what I'm saying?
[48:14.45]Does it design some characters?
[48:17.49]No, it's supposed to pay attention!
[48:19.37]I gotta pay attention, hold on.
[48:20.29]I swear to god, it's because of the wrist wrap.
[48:27.24]I'm gonna get this thing off.
[48:37.54]Tryhard streamer, yeah.
[48:43.60]You can just, like, twirl it with your wrist and it'll still do it.
[48:55.33]Safety first.
[48:56.21]I gotta get to 25.
[49:04.69]I'll get past 25, are you kidding me?
[49:17.23]Gentle, gentle, real gentle.
[49:18.81]Don't go too hard.
[49:21.83]What is this game?
[49:22.55]It's WarioWare.
[49:26.88]Jerma looks like my grandma.
[49:29.08]Oh, well, dearie, come and give me a big kiss.
[49:32.38]What am I doing?
[49:33.14]What do I do?
[49:36.66]I didn't even know what it was.
[49:51.20]Grandma sucks and is sweaty.

[79:35.85]It's getting too much.
[79:36.87]It's getting too much.
[79:38.99]What was my high score?
[79:40.71]3690?
[79:40.73]Cool.
[79:40.97]Did that do anything for me?
[79:45.29]Did I unlock any more traits?
[79:47.39]I don't think so.
[79:49.21]Tower tennis.
[79:56.45]Oh, this.
[79:56.91]Fuck this.
[80:05.21]I was going too hard with it.

[81:08.92]Who cares?
[81:09.78]It's like John Kerry hair right now.
[81:17.43]I cannot do anything about my John fucking Kerry haircut.
[81:31.15]Tug of war.
[81:31.87]Let's do it.

[82:41.23]Where do you see it?
[82:47.67]Huh?
[82:48.83]Huh?
[82:50.55]I shouldn't be doing that.
[82:52.97]I don't see anything.
[82:56.76]It's like the pixelation on the screen.
[82:58.30]It's in your mind.
[83:13.88]It's gonna get like, if I go get another, I'm gonna get like another shirt because you fucking guys have got me.
[83:18.74]I'm gonna like turn off my fucking face cam.

[84:02.00]Why did that work?
[84:05.06]I don't know.
[84:18.01]Good joke.
[84:18.45]It was actually kind of a good joke because it still worked.
[84:35.53]It's 3 a.m.
[84:36.97]6 hours.
[84:37.25]Yeah, I think so.
[84:38.93]What time is it?

[84:45.77]I'm sorry.
[84:49.85]Get off!
[84:51.25]You guys are fucking crazy.
[84:55.57]You guys are dreaming.
[84:56.55]All you see is like shadows.
[85:06.41]I'm gonna go put a jacket on.
[85:21.88]I gotta read some subs here.
[85:23.30]I'm like, I'm starting to sweat.
[85:28.24]Just barely.
[85:30.76]I'm so self-conscious.
[85:31.78]Well, I mean, when somebody tells me.
[85:33.78]Look at...
[85:34.90]Look at your nipples through your shirt, that gets a little weird.
[85:37.64]I knew I should have fucking... Oh yeah.
[86:00.67]I was reading the chat room.
[86:05.43]On the right side.
[86:06.35]It's just me.
[86:09.31]That's just my sweat.
[86:10.43]I don't think I've ever been able to do that one.
[86:13.93]It's like this, right?
[86:16.34]I'm just sweating through my shirt.
[86:17.58]I told you I was gonna sweat through my shirt.
[86:24.90]Like, this is me sweating through a shirt.
[86:27.85]Don't you understand?
[86:28.61]I'm not wearing a nipple shirt.
[86:34.92]Sudden death again.
[86:35.48]I gotta get to the least, like, 10.
[87:00.23]It's the lighting in here.
[87:01.05]It's too hot.
[87:06.33]It's like this bright light.
[87:08.23]Sorry.
[87:17.46]I gotta get to 10.
[87:18.42]I think if I get to 10, I unlock the next thing.
[87:21.72]Stop getting distracted.
[87:22.88]I can't help it.
[87:24.32]That's what I do.
[87:25.46]You're describing my entire fucking life.
[87:28.20]Being distracted.
[87:33.10]Alright, I'm gonna try.
[87:34.23]I don't care about my fucking nipples right now.
[87:36.31]I could care less.
[87:38.01]Good.
[87:39.33]Let's win.
[87:42.17]Gotta get seven.
[88:03.10]Not that the cat eats him.

[88:50.13]Should've gone that way.
[88:50.89]Gotta get to fucking 10.
[88:54.43]I have to get to 10 to unlock Insanity.
[88:56.71]I think it's really just 10.
[88:58.43]God damn it.
[89:02.36]Actually angry.
[89:16.88]What are you doing Otto?
[89:21.19]Woo!

[89:49.37]Why the fuck that doesn't work?
[89:51.53]You go like this.

[94:51.58]That's a realization to come by.
[94:54.46]It sure is.
[94:55.04]Thank you, man.
[94:57.59]You want me to do Devil's Third?
[95:00.43]Might as well.
[95:01.45]Let's just go back and play Devil's Third.
[95:02.63]Fuck it.
[95:06.81]Punch Out?
[95:07.65]For me to get Punch Out, it'll probably take like 3 hours to download it.
[95:11.87]So we're gonna have to do that a different time.
[95:13.67]Not right now.
[95:15.39]Not today, unfortunately.
[95:17.18]Not today.
[95:19.02]Maybe another time.
[95:22.08]No, wow.
[95:22.64]You guys really don't fucking want to see that game, huh?
[95:28.29]Holy shit.
[95:29.11]Nobody, no one wants to see Devil's 3rd.
[95:38.41]I'm not doing Super Mario Maker.
[95:39.81]I can't fucking play that game.
[95:41.90]Don't you understand?
[95:44.20]If I load up Super Mario Maker, this is gonna be a fucking terrible stream.
[95:47.70]It's gonna be awful.
[95:48.92]You're gonna leave.
[95:49.60]You're gonna fucking take off.
[95:50.90]You're not gonna want to be here for that.
[95:52.26]Trust me.
[95:53.56]I'm gonna get to a level, and I'm not gonna be able to figure it out in the first two levels, and twelve fucking hundred people are gonna leave because they fucking hate me.
[96:02.13]I can't play that game.
[96:06.85]Okay, we'll do a poll.
[96:07.69]Fine.
[96:09.96]I'm not putting fast draw on that poll.
[96:12.80]Because I know it's going to win.
[96:15.68]Dr. Jensen gave 2,000 bits right here, right now.
[96:20.42]Here's 1,000 bits for each.
[96:22.02]Wait, didn't you just... Did I pop up twice?
[96:25.47]Or am I a fucking idiot?
[96:27.21]I'm probably just a fucking idiot, you know.
[96:28.97]That's how it works.
[96:30.83]Play it on easy.
[96:33.15]Fine.
[96:33.87]Here, I'm doing a poll...
[96:37.71]I'm actually interested in what you guys want to do.
[96:39.37]Look at how far away I have to move my hands to get to this.
[96:42.69]I'm going like this.
[96:45.05]And I went to a virus website accidentally.
[96:47.09]Great.
[96:49.27]Cool.
[96:50.21]Cool virus website.
[96:55.16]Okay, what game do you want to see?
[96:58.50]WarioWare was fun, though.
[97:00.68]I highly recommend it if you've never played it.
[97:02.20]There's like four of them.
[97:03.30]There's like two on the DS...
[97:05.71]One on the Wii.
[97:06.47]The Wii U one sucks, I think, so don't get the one on the Wii U, but... You know.
[97:11.16]Okay.
[97:12.56]What was it again?
[97:13.56]It was... Mario Maker on Easy.
[97:22.93]That's gonna be so fucking boring.
[97:24.13]Why would you ever want to watch that?
[97:26.45]Mario Maker on Easy.
[97:27.35]What was the other one?
[97:32.50]Devil's Third.
[97:35.84]Or Fast Draw Showdown.
[97:36.90]I can't believe I'm actually putting this on the list.
[97:42.83]Mario Maker EZ Devil's Third Fast Draw Showdown.
[97:45.27]Here you go.
[97:51.99]For the third time.
[97:56.81]In two days.
[97:58.25]If that wins, I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[98:05.35]Go vote
[98:10.30]If you were just here to stick around for WarioWare, thanks for sticking around.
[98:15.16]There were a lot of people here.
[98:17.61]So... If you're taking off after WarioWare, then thanks for hanging out for the hours here that we played it.
[98:24.67]And have a good rest of your night.
[98:26.69]But for those of you that are still here... You know.
[98:32.84]You guys actually voting Fast Draw?
[98:34.96]Fast Draw Showdown is fucking winning.
[98:38.89]Why is Fast Draw winning by this much?
[98:41.73]You fucking guys are crazy.
[98:44.33]For the third time in 24 hours, I'm going to play Fast Draw Shodown.
[98:52.53]Nobody wants to watch Devil's Third.
[98:54.07]Holy shit.
[98:56.11]That to me is like the best fucking thing.
[98:58.95]Fuck that game.
[98:59.83]I don't want to watch him play that shitty game.
[99:10.80]Ah, yay, yay.
[99:13.96]Make some me's.
[99:14.97]No, I'm the only me that matters in this fucking console.
[99:20.07]Well, I... Pause over.
[99:23.97]We're playing fast draw by a fucking large margin.
[99:26.33]47% and there were three things to pick from.
[99:31.36]If that's what you want, then that's what you're gonna get.
[99:32.76]Okay.
[99:38.18]Okay.
[99:40.12]Thank you for voting.
[99:40.72]I need to turn it up then.

[99:46.34]It's going to be loud.
[99:49.94]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[99:50.94]I don't need a Wiimote for it either.
[99:55.24]Make a funny face?
[99:56.08]No!
[99:56.18]I'm not going to make a funny face.
[100:01.39]You can see my nipples through this fucking shirt, can't you?
[100:03.97]I'm going to go back to the Wii.
[100:13.66]Punch-Out or Riot?

[113:39.74]I don't even have that disc right now.
[113:43.35]It's like somewhere else in this house.
[113:44.55]I have no idea where.
[113:52.21]Go get the original Mario Brothers.
[113:55.93]That's loud.
[113:59.08]That's really fucking loud.
[114:00.86]Like, obnoxiously loud.
[114:06.09]What do I do?
[114:06.69]Play game.
[114:13.49]Look at that face.
[114:17.55]That's a really unphotogenic person.
[114:22.52]Alright.
[114:23.14]Ah, yeah, yeah.
[114:32.08]Turn it up.
[114:32.54]It's loud.
[114:33.20]It's as loud as it's going to be.
[114:34.04]And then we'll play... Oh, we're going to play Mario Maker.
[114:43.29]Sling shot.
[114:44.17]I can't even... That face.
[114:59.02]Why do I own this?
[115:06.78]Aim at the door.
[115:07.68]Oh, hit the door.
[115:08.64]Okay.
[115:09.06]What a fucking piece of shit.
[115:18.89]This game was probably 10 bucks.
[115:47.17]Super Mario Maker!
[115:49.52]Uneasy!
[115:53.90]I'm sorry that you had to witness that.
[116:03.84]I can't wait to beat Super Mario Maker.
[116:10.95]Mario Maker...
[116:13.75]Why am I doing this?
[116:15.17]I know what's gonna happen.
[116:16.20]I'm gonna get fucking really pissed off and everyone's like, here's what I'm fucking visualizing.
[116:20.92]I'm visualizing what the fuck's gonna happen.
[116:23.85]Get in the game.
[116:24.49]Okay, you're in the game.
[116:25.58]Jeremy, you're inside the game.
[116:26.76]You got the controller in you.
[116:27.46]You're doing very well.
[116:28.58]First level comes up.
[116:29.60]Really hard.
[116:30.18]Too hard for you.
[116:30.82]Way too hard for you.
[116:31.58]You'll never beat this game.
[116:32.62]You'll never beat this level at all.
[116:34.20]You're missing something.
[116:35.04]You can't see something.
[116:36.06]There's a spring that's over there somewhere, and you can't touch it.
[116:39.73]You keep missing it.
[116:41.21]Chad is scrolling down like, fucking idiot.
[116:43.45]Like, seriously.
[116:44.19]Get quotes.
[116:44.91]Seriously, this guy's a fucking idiot.
[116:46.95]Like, how can you be that bad?
[116:48.13]And I'm just sitting there like, fucking, I don't know.
[116:49.99]And then I finally get to the part where you're yelling at me for...
[116:53.14]and I it up and then like I see the fail fishes and everyone's just like screaming at me what a nightmare that's a nightmare let's go let's go it's gonna be like you didn't pick up like like Jerma how are you missing the block
[117:22.39]And I'm just gonna be like, I don't know.
[117:24.89]I don't know, man.
[117:25.61]And people are gonna fucking freak out, and then I'm gonna rage quit the game after the first level.
[117:37.36]See, look, I can already see it.
[117:38.50]You guys are already doing it.
[117:39.41]Here we go.
[117:45.15]I'm playing it on easy, though.
[117:49.04]Because I don't give a shit.
[117:51.54]Basecamp, too big.
[117:52.38]Nipples.
[117:53.24]Shhh.
[117:55.36]It's too soon to have a mental breakdown.
[117:57.14]Well, I just had one.
[117:59.02]I had one right there.
[117:59.84]Okay, let's go.
[118:06.40]Why did I just play fucking levels that you guys have made?
[118:08.42]You know what I'm saying?
[118:10.66]I'm not going to make myself angry.
[118:12.36]We're not going to do that.
[118:16.02]One more FailFish and the fucking stream ends.
[118:20.39]You think I'm kidding?
[118:21.69]You think I'm kidding?
[118:22.61]Get the mouse in the hand.
[118:24.05]One more!
[118:25.41]No, one more, one more and you lose the facecam.
[118:27.19]Oh, that... That's my hands.
[118:53.96]I think my stream crashed.
[119:06.91]Don't fuck it up again.
[119:07.77]Is the volume better?
[119:14.65]It should be.
[119:26.08]Alright, you know what I'm gonna do?
[119:28.88]In the Discord... If you have levels that you want me to play... Tell the people in the Discord.
[119:39.44]Because I'll open that up right now.
[119:42.34]And maybe some of the mods in the mod channel can give me some level codes?
[119:47.55]Maybe?
[119:48.79]If you guys want to do that?
[119:52.19]And make sure they're not like stupid fucking impossible levels that I won't beat.
[119:57.91]Face is too ugly.
[120:02.98]What the fuck did you just say?
[120:09.36]Yeah, so in the Discord, if some of the mods can work on that somehow.
[120:15.58]Probably easier that way.
[120:21.05]Don't send me impossible levels.
[120:23.93]And I just realized I just did something I probably shouldn't have.
[120:33.09]Alright, so I'm in the secret mod club.
[120:37.35]And let's get some of these level codes.
[120:40.11]Thanks a lot, guys.
[120:41.17]And yeah, sorry, I just shouted out the Discord to like 4,000 people.
[120:44.19]So sorry that now it's on.
[120:47.63]Now it's on.
[120:49.49]Apparently.
[120:53.71]Purple, you were on that in a second.
[120:59.28]And make sure they're G-rated levels, too.
[121:01.92]I don't want somebody spelling out the word, like, fuck you or something.
[121:04.36]You know what I'm saying?
[121:05.78]I don't want to see on my screen somebody spell out the word, fuck you.
[121:09.81]Don't want that on my stream.
[121:10.91]This is a fucking G stream.
[121:17.51]How are we supposed to check them?
[121:21.79]I don't know.
[121:24.23]I already got a couple.
[121:30.26]I'll try this one.
[121:30.74]Alright, let's go.
[121:31.32]What do I go?
[121:31.70]Curse World?
[121:35.18]We'll try this one.
[121:40.20]Courses, right?
[121:44.71]How do I do this?
[121:47.23]Starting new arrivals search?
[121:49.39]I don't know how to play this game.
[121:56.79]Course maker?
[121:58.27]Where do I go?
[121:58.91]I don't play this.
[121:59.79]Somebody needs to tell me what to do.
[122:08.02]Search?
[122:08.40]How come I can't go over there?
[122:14.28]Okay, I have to do it on my little dumb gamepad.
[122:16.74]Oh, here we go.
[122:17.62]Let's try this one.
[122:19.82]We'll put in this one first. 6059.
[122:26.66]You know, here's what we'll do.
[122:29.08]Let's try my credit card number and see if that's a level.
[122:34.74]I wonder if my credit card is a level.
[122:48.89]Alright, there's my credit card.
[122:52.97]I lost the pen, by the way.
[122:53.93]I don't know where it is.
[123:03.67]Call Nintendo for help.
[123:10.27]Okay, there's apparently a problem with that one.
[123:13.30]I guess that one had an issue.
[123:16.54]Okay.
[123:22.16]That's it.
[123:22.62]Let's try my mother's credit card.
[123:36.56]Exciting!
[123:50.55]Let's go.
[124:02.41]Come on.
[124:05.50]Alright.
[124:06.16]Clown Car Fiesta.
[124:11.87]Clown- Clown Car Fiesta.
[124:16.07]Let's do it.
[124:26.81]Now you get one of these things.
[124:28.77]You can shoot.
[124:29.27]So, um... Do I have to throw this thing?
[125:05.53]What a fucking idiot!
[125:06.79]He's a stupid asshole!
[125:19.51]Before anybody says a goddamn thing, I didn't even know that was a possibility in the game.
[125:24.85]I didn't even know that was a possibility.
[125:28.31]Nobody lose their minds like I didn't know that that was the thing you could do in the game.
[125:31.32]And now I'm gonna ace it.
[125:33.00]Check it.
[125:34.56]Come on, I want to do that so I get the fucking damage frames.
[125:54.95]I got it.
[125:55.49]Don't worry, I got it.
[125:56.35]This one's not even that bad.
[126:04.46]Fine.
[126:04.88]Can I hit the booze?
[126:25.67]I gotta queue one up after I get- I gotta- I'm not doing a good job getting rid of these.
[126:29.59]Alright, get out of the way.
[126:31.53]Ah, you stupid idiot.
[126:33.01]Ooh!
[126:33.41]Sniper!
[126:33.67]Shit.
[126:56.36]Hold on, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, easy.
[127:12.93]What do I do here?
[127:15.38]I don't know.
[127:18.10]I destroy these or something?
[127:20.40]But why?
[127:30.12]I gotta hit those bombs.
[127:31.62]I gotta make the bombs bounce.
[127:33.38]What's wrong with my guy?
[127:36.08]What a fucking fiesta.
[127:42.24]I got it.
[127:46.58]Who cares?
[127:47.12]I win.
[127:53.00]That's kinda cool.
[128:00.73]Oh, what a clown fiesta!
[128:02.16]I can't get hit though.
[128:03.14]Easy.
[128:03.42]GET OUT OF THE FUCKING CLOWN!
[128:04.56]Shit.
[128:31.45]I just like looked at myself and I looked like a fucking murderer.
[128:34.89]Why are you doing that?
[128:39.39]Is it like a checkpoint?
[128:41.81]Oh my fucking god.
[129:08.66]I win!
[129:15.20]American Psycho?
[129:19.21]I've ruined Discord, I'm sure I did.
[129:24.41]Just barely.
[129:25.07]Hey, that's a 7% completion.
[129:26.77]Add me to the list of people that beat that level.
[129:29.43]Because I just did it.
[129:32.80]Ugh.
[129:33.32]My whole body kind of hurts, though, after that.
[129:37.10]What can I do?
[129:39.71]Base game's not big enough?
[129:40.61]Okay, I'll fix it.
[129:51.11]Oh, BS.
[129:51.72]I'm gonna fucking scream in your face.
[129:53.24]There we go.
[130:00.72]But thank you, Mittens, for the fucking 50 bucks.
[130:02.68]Holy shit.
[130:05.28]50 bucks.
[130:06.46]Hey, do I get 50 dollars every time I complete a level?
[130:08.58]Alright.
[130:10.64]Don't do that.
[130:11.08]I'm kidding.
[130:12.17]That was a joke.
[130:12.67]Alright, let's try this one.
[130:16.41]Alright, let's put in somebody else's credit card.
[130:21.59]7% completion rate.
[130:34.61]That was me that did that.
[130:38.01]Alright, let's do another one.
[130:50.45]CB3B.
[130:52.32]Let's start with that.
[130:52.88]I have zeros.
[130:53.42]It's a whole bunch of zeros.
[130:55.14]No, no, no, no.
[131:04.28]2607.
[131:08.00]Let's try it.
[131:11.86]Don't touch the P switch.
[131:13.66]Hard.
[131:15.34]Ah, well.
[131:15.96]Remember what I... Remember what I said about not giving me levels that I won't be able to fucking beat.
[131:27.23]One... This is like 50 fucking thousand people can't beat this.
[131:33.60]More than 50 fucking thousand people couldn't beat it and you think I'm gonna be able to do it?
[131:41.24]Don't think so.
[131:44.09]I'll try my best.
[131:55.35]Don't touch the p-switch, you got it.
[132:19.88]Speedrun.
[132:21.73]You guys didn't think I was practicing this shit for weeks?!
[132:30.43]Ow.
[132:34.15]I didn't even touch it.
[132:49.03]When did I step on one?
[132:50.11]I fucking don't get it.
[133:24.50]Fast.
[133:24.84]Don't stop.
[133:36.85]No.
[133:37.45]No.
[133:39.87]No.
[133:42.69]On to the next one.
[133:47.94]This one.
[133:53.02]This streamer looks like a noob.
[133:54.76]Hey!
[133:56.02]You're right.
[133:58.16]Next level.
[134:02.71]I'm hungry.
[134:03.27]My stomach is rumbling.
[134:04.33]What should I eat?
[134:04.69]What do you guys think?
[134:07.59]Chicken nuggets?
[134:08.25]No, no.
[134:08.89]I have fresh salmon in the fridge.
[134:10.71]I'm gonna fucking sear.
[134:11.53]I'm gonna pan sear with some lemon and some butter and some garlic and oil.
[134:15.72]And then I'm just gonna fucking squish it in my hands and just... That's it.
[134:18.64]That's how I eat.
[134:21.42]What am I doing?
[134:22.04]Oh yeah, this.
[134:26.91]I wish it wasn't fucking credit card numbers, honest to God.
[134:34.35]Food stream?
[134:36.21]No, no food.
[134:37.25]No, no, no, no.
[134:38.55]No food stream.
[134:39.29]2, 9, 8, 3.
[134:46.06]B, 8, 9, 3.
[134:58.12]Explore as Mega Man or as Let's find out How do I shoot the gun?
[135:41.95]Can you, like, slide as Mega Man?
[135:44.83]Why did I just do that?
[135:49.51]What the fuck am I supposed to be doing here?
[135:59.41]Do I have to, like, kill everything?
[136:00.35]I have no idea.
[136:06.88]Ooh.
[136:07.46]Samus!
[136:08.90]Oh, I can turn myself into a fucking croissant!
[136:13.74]And why can I...
[136:28.46]Nice.
[136:30.93]I can probably get that.
[136:39.99]AHHHHH!
[137:01.30]I can beat that.
[137:05.54]Fucking, who cares about Mega Man?
[137:07.54]Actually, I do.
[137:08.10]No, whatever. ...
[137:30.31]Risky, really risky.
[137:31.99]Huh?
[137:43.00]I don't... I don't get it.
[137:48.25]Am I missing something here?
[137:53.63]I fucking fell off the edge and I tried to jump.
[137:59.58]I got it.
[137:59.98]This time, I'm going fucking full-on fast.
[138:28.07]Hey, what's that next one we got lined up?
[138:40.97]Hey, what do you know?
[138:42.40]Look at that one.
[138:48.30]I missed your sub on the 27th.
[138:49.86]Well, I'm a piece of shit.
[138:51.86]Thanks for subbing.
[138:52.68]I actually probably should catch up with some subs here.
[138:56.33]What's this one?
[138:57.23]You will die.
[138:58.47]Let's just play it.
[138:59.15]Who cares?
[139:00.87]Who even gives a shit anymore, right?
[139:02.25]I'm just gonna play random ones now.
[139:10.99]You will die.
[139:11.95]I know where the flower is now.
[139:18.16]I didn't even fucking mean to do that.
[139:22.86]It's alright.
[139:23.78]Make it interesting.
[139:29.64]Come over here so I can kill you.
[139:30.78]Can I kill you?
[139:42.52]Yeah, I can.
[139:48.71]Come on, right down the middle.
[139:50.23]Right down the middle.
[139:52.19]Go.
[140:04.12]What a kill!
[140:06.24]God fucking damn it!
[140:15.18]Told you I fucking di- I told you I'm not a Mario player!
[140:19.46]Or am I?
[140:43.05]Get out of the fucking course.
[140:48.09]I don't like playing fucking Mario.
[140:49.95]I don't... I knew this was going to happen.
[140:51.95]I already told you that this was going to happen.
[141:00.74]How we doing on the sweat marker?
[141:02.76]Actually, you know what?
[141:03.42]I don't think we're sweating anymore.
[141:05.24]Well, yeah, we are.
[141:07.32]Yeah, we are.
[141:11.38]Mission impossible.
[141:15.64]Let's try Mission Impossible.
[141:26.87]Hold on, hold on.
[141:32.95]Alright, let's go.
[141:34.21]This one.
[141:39.13]This one has like 75,000 upvotes.
[141:42.77]This was on the front page of Mario Reddit today.
[141:48.10]Just go over it?
[141:54.24]Okay.
[142:07.20]Oh, you get to be a box!
[142:24.06]This is cute.
[142:25.26]I like this one.
[142:26.14]It's cute.
[142:29.66]Whoever made this, you are fucking adorable.
[142:51.40]Sneaky way?
[142:51.94]Sneaky way.
[142:56.95]Why am I like a cat Mario?
[143:07.32]There's more.
[143:13.22]What is going on?
[143:15.12]We're like three Mario's?
[143:26.20]This music just isn't Mission Impossible anymore, is it?
[143:30.32]Oh, there's still these three.
[143:36.51]Can I get up there?
[143:41.93]No.
[143:42.93]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[144:07.23]I... Oh, we rescued somebody?
[144:08.71]Is that what it's supposed to be?
[144:10.53]How do I get that one?
[144:12.91]Oh, the alarm went off.
[144:17.76]I get it.
[144:18.20]I get it.
[144:20.16]What a fun little level.
[144:23.06]Yeah.
[144:37.89]Is that it?
[144:43.19]I can't move faster than this.
[144:45.08]Sorry, we're right there.
[145:06.69]I wasn't paying attention, that's my own fault.
[145:09.03]I didn't know you had to go all the way down.
[145:27.45]Not that fast.
[145:29.39]Jesus fucking god.
[145:32.41]You gotta be perfect!
[145:36.63]What if I just jump out?
[145:37.45]Should I just jump out?
[145:39.52]I'll jump out.
[145:40.34]I was just playing and raging at this.
[145:50.76]Well, I'm getting there.
[145:51.53]I don't know why I think there's fall damage in Mario.
[146:02.23]Go, please!
[146:09.24]fall damage.
[146:09.90]I thought that was fall damage.
[146:11.10]Sorry.
[146:12.36]What an idiot.
[146:15.80]Woo!
[146:17.42]You know anybody that does that?
[146:22.96]They like jump with the controller.
[146:27.83]Somebody give me a hundred bucks?
[146:29.79]This is what I'm talking about.
[146:30.79]I can't like fucking see my and hear my notifications.
[146:33.99]Holy shit.
[146:35.77]Mr. Sneakman just gave me a fucking hundred bucks, 10,000 bits.
[146:42.73]It's because I don't have my echo location on.
[146:46.73]But when was that?
[146:47.49]It was like a couple minutes ago.
[146:48.86]Thanks a lot, dude.
[146:50.50]Mr. Sneakman.
[146:51.90]And they say snake, snake, snake.
[146:56.28]I can do that better.
[146:57.00]Snake, snake, snake.
[147:00.70]Thank you, Sneakman.
[147:02.22]That's fucking incredibly kind of you.
[147:03.96]And I've ruined my Discord.
[147:06.62]Why is it anonymous for me?
[147:08.46]50 bucks.
[147:13.71]Hey, look.
[147:15.17]At some point, people are going to know it existed, right?
[147:19.09]I'm sorry.
[147:19.53]I fucked it up.
[147:21.35]My little brother made this level in an EG World Magpie.
[147:23.43]I'll play that right now.
[147:26.28]Magpie's little brother made this next level.
[147:28.76]We're going to play it.
[147:30.86]Let's give it a try.
[147:35.43]$100 joke.
[147:38.35]Oh, I cleared it.
[147:40.49]Look at that.
[147:41.69]23%.
[147:41.71]That's pretty damn good.
[147:47.47]Alright, Magpie's little brother made this one.
[147:51.08]Let's punch in Magpie's little brother's credit card.
[147:54.18]I'm gonna do that joke as many more fucking times tonight as I can, by the way.
[147:58.50]And you better laugh at it.
[148:01.80]That's fucking funny.
[148:05.70]O2E.
[148:06.78]O2E.
[148:07.70]0.
[148:13.04]4F1C.
[148:13.34]Let's see what it is.
[148:18.58]It's called Good Level.
[148:28.61]Good Level.
[148:29.95]Let's check it out.
[148:38.76]It's just a loud level.
[148:50.57]Hey, look at that one.
[148:53.25]That was a fucking great one.
[148:54.43]Oh, alright.
[149:04.87]Hey, it was a good level.
[149:11.78]You know what?
[149:12.16]Let's do it again!
[149:12.84]Goddamn, what a level!
[149:26.46]Thank you, Magpie.
[149:32.96]Darkstar, thank you for the bits.
[149:34.14]I've missed most of this stream, but I wanted to say that you are a handsome fuck.
[149:40.85]You can't make me shy.
[149:42.76]That was awful.
[149:43.84]That was terrible.
[149:44.52]I was going to say bashful and it came out as shy.
[149:46.38]I didn't want to be too loud because I'm this close to the microphone.
[149:49.22]I didn't want to be too close.
[149:52.20]I didn't want to fuck anybody's ears up.
[149:53.68]Because that's not cool.
[149:56.33]What's this called again?
[150:00.19]Autosyncratic masturbation ready.
[150:05.29]Something along those lines.
[150:08.98]Hey, Sturma95, thanks for the 1,000 bits, the 10 bucks.
[150:12.72]Dude.
[150:17.80]World record.
[150:18.52]Well, thank you, Sterma.
[150:20.58]Great level, he says.
[150:25.70]Exit.
[150:25.98]Let's play another one.
[150:29.14]We have the cutest streamers.
[150:31.72]You guys, I'm not that cute.
[150:35.68]You know who's cuter than me?
[150:42.32]He's down there.
[150:43.44]But I'm too lazy to go get the camera and point it over at him.
[150:49.02]Alright, what other levels has he made?
[150:51.10]Let's play them all.
[150:53.18]What about this one?
[150:55.86]We're playing his other level.
[150:57.44]Magpie, I hope he's prepared.
[150:59.40]We're playing this level by Magpie's brother.
[151:02.84]Let's take a look.
[151:07.16]Whoa, this one's a little more advanced.
[151:14.53]You're just locked in here with the angry... I tried to duck.
[151:19.87]Alright, I'm just gonna feel for it.
[151:21.45]Can I jump out of here?
[151:24.81]Wow, that's a tough one.
[151:27.40]That's a toughie.
[151:30.66]I like this one, though.
[151:31.44]I wanna do it again.
[151:31.96]Yeah, you know how fast I can do this shit?
[151:43.76]Watch this.
[151:51.67]Ooh, just gotta be careful.
[151:55.69]Whoa!
[151:57.42]What the fuck happened?
[151:58.22]Did I get squashed?
[151:59.14]Alright, last attempt.
[152:03.70]Somebody said the Undertale level is an Undertale level.
[152:05.55]I'm sure it's cool.
[152:20.16]Don't get crushed.
[152:20.86]I actually don't care about that because I'd rather be right here.
[152:28.81]That's a good level, but I can't do it.
[152:31.93]I won't do it.
[152:35.14]I won't do it.
[152:35.64]You understand?
[152:41.58]What's that?
[152:43.78]I won't do it.
[152:53.39]Alright, what else we got on this list?
[152:55.03]Actually, let me check.
[152:55.49]Let me see if any of the... Minxie sent some.
[152:59.09]Let's take a look.
[152:59.79]Minxie.
[153:01.33]Let's try one of these levels that Minxie put in.
[153:03.34]Minxie, one of our resident mods here.
[153:13.48]Yeah, stop biting my lip.
[153:14.34]It's a bad habit.
[153:17.11]As he immediately does it again.
[153:21.17]B, E, A, 2...
[153:25.03]My lips used to get so chapped and fucking irritated.
[153:28.11]Ah, of course not found it.
[153:28.87]Did I put it in wrong?
[153:33.65]I did.
[153:37.42]Hmm.
[153:37.68]What is it?
[153:41.32]0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8.
[153:44.18]There we are.
[153:58.31]The trick house.
[154:03.26]Trick house.
[154:03.70]1% clear rate.
[154:06.78]Good.
[154:08.22]These are my favorite types of levels.
[154:21.04]I thought that was a wall.
[154:54.19]I thought that was... I tried to jump, but fucking Wiimote sucks.
[154:57.87]My Wiimote's out of batteries.
[154:59.49]Look at this.
[155:02.01]Ah, something's wrong here.
[155:03.25]Something's not right.
[155:05.10]Ah.
[155:06.22]Ah, my Wiimote's out of batteries.
[155:08.90]Wiimote's out of batteries, guys.
[155:17.35]Fucking Wiimote.
[155:19.29]Using a fucking Wiimote to play Mario Maker.
[155:22.15]What a dumbass.
[155:22.95]Something's wrong with this one, too.
[155:26.03]Something's wrong with this.
[155:36.24]This is worse.
[155:41.36]This is a dirty fucking screen.
[155:43.18]You guys have no idea.
[155:52.62]If I wanted to play on this screen, I couldn't.
[155:55.04]It looks like somebody threw up on it.
[155:57.51]It looks like somebody fucking puked on this.
[155:59.07]It's actually easy to play on this.
[156:02.87]I'm gonna beat the level looking down.
[156:14.27]What's going on here?
[156:16.17]I don't get this.
[156:16.97]Can I jump up here?
[156:25.10]I don't play Mario, guys.
[156:25.98]I don't play these games.
[156:37.33]I fucked it up.
[156:43.30]I didn't even know that that was a fucking thing you could do.
[156:46.04]This is why I didn't want to play this fucking game on stream.
[156:48.24]This is why I didn't want to fucking- I already fucked it up!
[156:53.91]Paying any attention, pay attention.
[156:56.75]It's not that fucking hard, it's actually pretty easy.
[157:05.46]Never mind.
[157:05.98]It just got a lot harder.
[157:06.84]I don't care about coins.
[157:14.37]Hmm.
[157:19.09]Huh?
[157:25.59]Huh?
[157:41.07]How do I get down there?
[158:16.99]How do I give this level a fucking D minus?
[158:24.25]We'll try this one.
[158:25.91]That was a good level.
[158:29.13]I had it.
[158:29.67]No, sure, I did have it, but I ain't doing that again. ...
[158:49.08]Whoops.
[158:50.94]I just joined the Discord voice server for like fucking three seconds.
[158:59.25]I hope nobody fucking said I could.
[159:00.57]I don't even know what they said.
[159:01.31]Alright, let's try this one.
[159:13.61]A...
[159:19.09]This is like a fucking thousand people in there.
[159:25.34]I can't even fucking be in that room.
[159:31.77]I can only imagine what's going on in that room.
[159:46.40]Yeah, because right here, right?
[159:47.78]This is connected to my monitor.
[159:50.85]So I have no, like, PC sound.
[159:52.53]So I can't hear anything that's coming out of my computer.
[159:58.95]Hopefully nobody said anything fucking bad.
[160:00.45]Uh, what did Mixie just say?
[160:08.78]It's all my fault, Mixie.
[160:10.28]I know.
[160:17.35]I better get overpaid for this.
[160:25.44]Let me put the rest of this in.
[160:35.98]That's not... What is going on with this shit?
[160:38.38]Stop it.
[160:42.79]I wish I had my stylus.
[160:44.25]This is going to make me throw up.
[160:45.39]1, 8.
[160:48.17]A.
[160:48.31]3, 3.
[160:48.61]6, D. Let's try this one.
[160:57.29]I just went to go pick up my Wiimote and I made that stupid joke and I have to use this for the rest of the time.
[161:00.43]Great.
[161:01.59]A Bowser Jr.'
[161:02.43]'s Troublesome Tanks.
[161:10.69]Okay.
[161:11.41]Alright, let's do it.
[161:19.14]This is like the old Mario 3 levels.
[161:20.74]These are fun.
[161:25.10]Can't go down there.
[161:27.44]I probably should wait before I jump anywhere.
[161:29.34]Let's see what the hell's going on.
[161:30.76]Sweat check?
[161:31.22]We will in a second.
[161:32.60]Thank you for reminding me.
[161:37.46]What's down there?
[161:42.74]I can't tell...
[161:50.52]Don't explode on me.
[161:53.38]Woo!
[161:55.30]Get those coins!
[161:57.74]Do I gotta go down?
[162:08.57]Maybe.
[162:08.83]Oh fuck, I'm in trouble.
[162:11.53]Gotta jump off one of these, gotta jump off one of these.
[162:16.81]I guess not!
[162:21.64]My dog is like having a dream right now.
[162:30.46]Can you hear that?
[162:55.01]Somebody hit me so I can just... No, I don't know what to do.
[163:00.40]Get me him.
[163:00.74]He's the boss.
[163:03.62]Okay.
[163:03.98]Fuck, what the hell, man?
[163:05.18]Give me a break.
[163:07.72]I gotta wait.
[163:11.84]I can't fucking play Super Mario Brothers!
[163:16.63]I can't... Sweat check!
[163:19.01]Yeah!
[163:27.52]Too much shit in the way.
[163:28.42]Fucking god.
[163:52.24]I just have no fucking patience.
[163:53.76]I can't play these games.
[163:56.01]I have, like, the patience of a, like, lab rat.
[164:00.28]I can't fucking... I hate it.
[164:05.36]It's like scratching your head, rubbing your belly, and, like, spitting and blowing boogers out of your nose at the same time.
[164:11.78]I don't like it.
[164:12.20]I don't want to do it.
[164:13.02]I ain't dead.
[164:21.48]There's too much going on at the same time.
[164:27.57]I can't- I can't fucking do it.
[164:28.91]I'm gonna put a fucking- I'm gonna whip a bottle at my screen.
[164:41.99]Nope.
[165:06.17]Fuck!
[165:06.71]Can I sneak this one in there?
[165:17.80]TAKE IT IN THERE!
[165:32.19]DOI NONONONO!
[165:35.46]Pain in the fucking nuts.
[166:05.23]Gonna get this, eventually.
[166:12.37]God, wrong way!
[166:25.27]Fucking hand movement, this way, I swear to God.
[166:28.31]That's it, I'm done after this level.
[167:46.48]Alright, I just had a tea break.
[167:47.46]I'm good.
[168:02.29]It's like... My fucking hand, right?
[168:07.80]When I'm holding on right...
[168:10.60]This thing is so fucking dirty.
[168:13.04]This thing is so dirty and fucked up that when I let go of this button, sometimes it still stays down.
[168:20.12]And that's why, like, I'm fucking throwing them behind me.
[168:25.71]Oh, I accidentally just did that.
[168:31.61]I'm gonna go dunk this in the fucking dishwasher.
[168:48.12]This is a fucking censor bar, yeah!
[168:51.74]You're pushing yourself too hard.
[168:53.20]I tried to tell you guys I don't play those games.
[169:05.33]Especially with a dirty fucking gamepad.
[169:06.93]Alright, um... That was fun.
[169:20.70]Now we're going to play something else.
[169:25.21]Hold on a second.
[169:36.72]Better.
[169:42.50]Stream over?
[169:42.96]No, not yet.
[169:44.48]I'm not sweating enough.
[169:45.62]I probably am.
[169:48.27]Let me move this out of the way.
[169:52.39]Okay.
[169:53.69]We're going to play Devil's Third.
[169:54.69]Because I just feel like running around and shooting stuff.
[170:01.67]Take a break.
[170:02.34]Relax.
[170:06.40]Relax.
[170:08.40]It's time to relax.
[170:15.17]Have I really been going for three hours?
[170:16.45]It feels like a lot shorter than that.
[170:20.46]Devil's Third, finally.
[170:21.98]We just come full... We come full circle every time.
[170:26.22]Devil's Third, we played last night.
[170:28.04]Then we played the Fast Draw Showdown.
[170:30.24]Then we played Mario Maker, and I fucking... I had a moment where I fucking got really mad, and I got out of Mario Maker.
[170:35.17]And now tonight, we started with WarioWare, and then we come back to fucking this stupid fucking shit game.
[170:44.55]That's not fair.
[170:45.51]It's not fair.
[170:45.97]I'm just inventing.
[170:46.75]It's not fair.
[170:47.21]Mario Maker's a great game.
[170:51.77]Mario Maker is a great game.
[170:52.91]It is.
[170:53.87]I'm just venting.
[170:55.11]But then we're going to full circle, going to go back to the terrible game that nobody likes.
[171:01.92]Rest in peace.
[171:02.52]Seriously, probably like 1,500 people because nobody fucking likes this game.
[171:09.44]But if you were here for this, then thanks for sticking around.
[171:12.50]See you next time, probably.
[171:16.16]Let's go.
[171:18.35]Oh, I... It doesn't do it for me, right?
[171:20.31]Okay, that doesn't do it.
[171:21.09]I have to actually do it.
[171:21.89]Okay.
[171:22.81]I said let's go thinking it was gonna do it.
[171:30.44]No more fast draw showdown.
[171:32.44]No.
[171:33.58]Not happening.
[171:39.58]But, before we get started... Thank you, LockyMan, for the 10 months.
[171:45.36]Love the streams.
[171:45.88]Keep it up.
[171:46.20]Well, thanks, man.
[171:46.98]I'm going to keep it up for sure.
[171:49.54]Rosie Posey, 22.
[171:50.48]Thanks for the two months.

[172:05.71]Thank you for your new sub.
[172:06.63]SuperFrodo as well.
[172:09.33]GHuntsWazabi for two months.
[172:13.07]You like the hair?
[172:14.71]I mean, it needs a little styling.
[172:17.15]I have, like, this style mousse stuff that, like, I can, like, kind of slick it back.
[172:20.57]Then I'd really look like a fucking senator.
[172:22.79]I get real senator hair that way.
[172:24.73]That's, like, what I'm going for.
[172:25.65]That's the look I'm going for now.
[172:28.48]Uh, Dr. Dial-Up, thanks for the new sub.
[172:30.22]Wee-than.
[172:32.02]Platypus Sunday armor end.
[172:35.44]And while this hit, let me... Start it.
[172:42.04]Let's go.
[172:45.30]Armor End Cat, thanks for the two subs.
[172:49.10]The Mag Mage, thanks for two months.
[172:51.46]Mangote, indestructible, 583.
[172:55.26]Kivas, Cheelsy101, beefyweefy, 23 for the nine months.
[173:00.00]Thanks a lot, dude.
[173:01.68]Welcome back, guys, and welcome new people.
[173:03.58]And Meme Machine has also resubscribed for three months.
[173:08.40]And a fine special one.
[173:10.10]Thank you.
[173:11.66]What about bits?
[173:12.75]Anything?
[173:13.43]Any new bits that I missed?
[173:14.83]Probably?
[173:17.55]Who uses a mouse in 2016?
[173:19.81]A lot of people.
[173:22.05]Never Trust Purple with the 500 bits says... Voice 2 was a nuclear crater.
[173:29.82]Whoops.
[173:31.04]Sorry.
[173:32.94]Sam N for the 500 bits too.
[173:34.16]Your hair makes you look like a young dapper man from the 20s.
[173:41.84]Thank you, Sam.
[173:43.52]Magpie again.
[173:44.44]300 bits.
[173:44.80]There's an invisible block to the left.
[173:46.10]Speedrun it.
[173:47.12]I fucking missed it.
[173:49.76]I missed it.

[174:00.35]I am actually going to take a pee break.
[174:02.11]So.

[174:05.67]See you guys in a minute.
[174:09.46]One minute.
[174:19.29]Wrong thing.
[174:21.27]There we go.

[175:56.94]Thank you.
[176:58.68]I'm back.
[177:05.50]Why do I spend money on this Garbo streamer?
[177:07.78]Hey, man.
[177:08.66]Come on.
[177:10.70]Garbo?
[177:13.44]Oh, well, I'm one-fourth to the gold badge now.
[177:15.52]Here I go.
[177:17.30]Oh, thank you, Pagie.
[177:18.40]That's very nice of you.
[177:20.73]I have to update this.
[177:21.59]I'm not playing Mario Maker anymore.
[177:34.67]Why am I playing Wii garbage?
[177:37.45]Um... I wanted to play this game and then I've had my Wii just hooked up still for the last couple days.
[177:45.98]And...
[177:47.71]It actually is kind of a huge pain in the ass to, like, switch this console out and, like, put something else there and, like, reset up everything for a stream.
[177:56.65]It's, like, kind of annoying.
[177:57.41]Because, like, oh, if you want to play like this or, you know, let's go play Peggle.
[178:03.12]I have to, like, move my desk and, like, actually reset up a console back here.
[178:09.86]And then, like, connect it and get it ready and make sure the audio off sync.
[178:13.20]It's just, like, it's a pain in the ass.
[178:17.18]Where's the face cam?
[178:17.96]Uh-oh.
[178:19.64]Uh-oh.
[178:20.52]Is the face cam fucking gone?
[178:22.14]Forever?
[178:22.48]I don't know.
[178:28.73]Smash Brothers.
[178:29.29]All my Wii games are not here.
[178:30.85]I don't know where the fuck they are.
[178:32.09]Alright.
[178:35.87]We had a save, didn't we?
[178:40.03]By the way, is it too loud?
[178:43.41]Too loud?
[178:43.81]Too soft?
[178:44.19]What do you think?
[178:46.84]Will, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[178:48.42]There used to be voice channels.
[178:49.80]That was havoc.
[178:52.00]I accidentally went inside one.
[178:58.42]That was like a... I didn't even mean to click it.
[179:00.98]I don't know why I went in.
[179:03.58]But thank you so much for the 50 bucks, dude.
[179:05.76]Much appreciated.
[179:08.22]It's good.
[179:12.85]Facecam facecam or I'm leaving uh-oh uh-oh hold on shit Don't leave don't leave me come back Alright, who's ready?
[179:33.98]Load game story Continue this mission sure
[179:44.59]The face cam is on.
[179:45.65]It's on.
[179:46.17]Look, I'm here.
[179:48.23]I can see you.
[179:58.36]Alright, what were we doing?
[180:01.10]Oh, this game.
[180:01.56]I forgot it runs like shit.
[180:06.76]I forgot how bad this was.
[180:08.47]Sorry, I forgot.
[180:10.07]I went into it accidentally.
[180:14.65]Alright, don't... I have like... I have like... I got like roommates here.
[180:18.45]We're fine.
[180:18.83]I'll be alright.
[180:20.09]I got like a bunch of roommates.
[180:21.07]Let's just like... take them on.
[180:34.10]Second floor.
[180:34.74]You got it.
[180:36.64]I lost 700 viewers.
[180:38.01]Well, that's kind of to be expected.
[180:40.35]This game is fucking stupid.
[180:45.98]Nobody asked for this.
[180:46.88]Well, because we're closing the stream out with this game.
[180:50.40]We have to come full circle.
[180:51.86]When we play Wii U, we go full circle.
[180:56.41]Switch the gameplay screen with the face screen?
[181:03.51]Switch the game... Okay, I need to do that for fun.
[181:13.05]Why?
[181:14.03]Why do I think this is funny?
[181:21.86]I'm not gonna, like, look down like this.
[181:31.04]I can't do it like this.
[181:36.48]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[181:40.66]Still alive, hold on.
[181:41.60]Still alive.
[181:49.78]Oh my god.
[182:04.71]Okay, there we go.
[182:06.57]Alright, where do I go?
[182:09.13]Up that way?
[182:09.79]Okay.
[182:10.87]Shoot that guy!
[182:12.17]Nice work, good work!
[182:18.47]I don't wanna get, like, banned.
[182:27.09]Plus, you guys can see, like, my fucking zit up close now.
[182:29.50]Look at that.
[182:34.16]The one day I decided to turn a facecam on.
[182:36.26]The one fucking day.
[182:37.04]Look at this.
[182:45.17]Gross.
[183:02.57]Where's, uh... What the hell happened to my fucking facecam?
[183:11.05]Banned for facial blemish.
[183:19.13]I know, right?
[183:19.95]Banned forever.
[183:20.75]Banned for fucking life!
[183:27.41]Not like this even fucking matters.
[183:30.60]Is this even the right spot?
[183:31.60]Yeah, it is.
[183:32.04]Alright, let's keep going.
[183:39.06]Auto cam or we're leaving.
[183:40.41]No.
[183:41.35]This game is fucking awful.
[183:59.65]Use concealer.
[184:01.39]I don't usually have.
[184:02.17]I don't usually have, like, blemish problems, but... What is shooting me?
[184:07.26]For some reason, it was like, oh, you know, I'm gonna turn my facecam on today.
[184:13.68]Hey, well, now you're gonna have a fucking zit on your face.
[184:16.44]Ah, you know, that's typically how it works, right?
[184:19.08]It's like the night before prom.
[184:22.38]I'm going to the prom.
[184:24.16]But holy shit, I have a blemish!
[184:34.96]This is fucking cruelly.
[184:38.08]I would- Yeah, you know, now I know why like 700 people fucking left.
[184:45.24]I prob- I actually probably would rather you, uh, hit me with a brick in the hand.
[184:51.24]Like, I just place my fucking hand down here, and I just go, DO IT!
[184:56.46]And you just like, smash my hand with a brick.
[184:59.04]Only one time though, not more than once.
[185:14.30]Special move.
[185:16.72]Special move.
[185:17.14]Do it.
[185:21.22]Otto came.
[185:21.62]Otto's actually not even in the room anymore.
[185:22.86]He left.
[185:29.10]We just gotta get to one more boss in this game, and then I'll be satisfied forever.
[185:35.29]Check my bits.
[185:36.27]Wait, we got some bits?
[185:39.79]Oh, shit.
[185:41.85]We do have bits.
[185:47.50]No, you make it worse.
[185:48.30]Don't you guys know that if you, like, pop a zit, it gets worse?
[185:50.62]It's way worse.
[185:55.24]You gotta be careful with that shit, but... Magpie, thanks for the thousand.
[185:59.99]Sure you can't play one more level.
[186:01.55]I made it just for you.
[186:04.67]Fine.
[186:05.71]Before I end the stream, I'll play that last level.
[186:07.73]But thank you for the ten bucks, dude.
[186:09.57]Karamonti, thank you for the twenty bucks.
[186:10.83]Since when did this stream chat hate watching shitty games?
[186:15.53]I mean, there's like shitty games, and then there's like... This game's like a chore to play, you know what I mean?
[186:26.10]I don't even know what I did.
[186:32.58]Just wanna get to one more boss.
[186:34.24]This game's so bad.
[186:36.12]There's random shit bosses like every 20 minutes, don't worry.
[186:38.42]We're just gonna go until we find one.
[186:41.24]Enemy's not even paying attention that I'm in their dumb hallway of enemies.
[186:46.98]This way?
[186:47.34]No.
[186:47.64]Come on.
[186:48.16]Get me out of here.
[186:53.48]What?
[186:58.30]Where does it want me to go?
[186:59.58]I just went over here.
[187:00.98]What the fuck is going on?
[187:07.26]Boss.
[187:07.96]Boss.
[187:12.43]Not a boss.
[187:14.65]That cutscene didn't have to fucking exist.
[187:18.89]There was no reason for the cutscene that we just watched to be on screen.
[187:22.16]Ever.
[187:23.10]Alright, that was fun.
[187:43.35]Owned.
[187:43.81]Yeah, they got fucking owned.
[187:58.40]Switch, switch, switch.
[188:05.16]Alright, that wasn't... That was...
[188:14.14]That was close.
[188:15.87]I have a rocket launcher.
[188:16.77]Yeah, but who cares?
[188:17.87]Like, it doesn't even matter.
[188:19.07]The rocket launcher, like, sucks, too.
[188:46.13]Like four rockets to kill like five people in the same spot Grenades don't do anything either.
[188:55.25]It's just it's just awful.
[188:56.85]What a terrible just awful game It's not that bad it's bad.
[189:03.06]It's really bad, but it's not that bad Come on give me to a boss so I can stop this madness
[189:20.92]Yeah.
[189:28.24]Over a thousand people left because of this.
[189:31.44]Well, I mean, I was... It's pretty much the end of the stream, anyways, if you think about it.
[189:36.17]I wanted to, like, do WarioWare for a little bit.
[189:39.13]Play some of the little games, and then this is just kind of to close it out for tonight.
[189:44.77]boss come on boss I don't think this is a boss but he sure is taking a lot of hits when's the roblox stream
[190:15.85]He's not going to just keep walking over here, is he?
[190:20.72]You fucking idiot.
[190:33.65]Oh my lord.
[190:38.74]He's just gonna stand here, isn't he?
[190:40.46]Just get exploded by these, please.
[190:42.23]Die.
[190:43.63]He died.
[190:44.63]Bye.
[190:45.39]Bye, hard fucking enemy.
[190:46.79]You're dead.
[190:49.61]Ha.
[190:52.91]Yeah, we're getting to the end.
[190:53.84]We're getting to the end where I don't think I can do it anymore.
[190:59.56]Didn't the new frog fractions come out?
[191:09.15]When I die again, I'm done.
[191:42.45]These random fucking enemies are stupid.
[191:44.03]They're so desperately trying to move my... There ain't no moving.
[191:55.42]It's over.
[191:58.06]Like, I couldn't... Like, I'm... Hey, thanks everybody for watching!
[192:11.76]It wouldn't even fucking move.
[192:12.84]I was trying to do it.
[192:14.94]Final sweat check.
[192:15.66]What do you think?
[192:16.50]How are you doing?
[192:17.28]Good?
[192:17.48]Bad?
[192:18.39]I can't tell.
[192:21.59]What if I had my hair back like this?
[192:23.33]Would it be better?
[192:24.69]What do you think?
[192:27.89]All the way back?
[192:28.41]I should do like Mad Scientist.
[192:29.61]What do you guys think?
[192:36.76]It looked like a fucking Jimmy Neutron character.
[192:40.93]Yeah, that's gonna be it, guys.
[192:43.47]Thanks for sticking around.
[192:46.13]I'm gonna play the Mario Maker level and then I'm gonna get out of here.
[192:59.42]So let's do that.
[193:01.88]Shave everything.
[193:02.52]I would look so bad bald.
[193:04.47]I would look fucking terrible.
[193:09.18]So let's just... So we don't make this mistake again.
[193:11.08]I don't want to make this mistake again.
[193:12.84]So we're gonna... We're gonna do something here.

[194:11.26]You're screaming at the people in Discord?
[194:17.72]Keep in mind that was 30 bucks.
[194:18.78]It was 30 bucks, but it's whatever.
[194:20.41]Who cares?
[194:21.99]Who cares?
[194:25.27]The Discord is in Discord.
[194:26.53]That's a good way to put it.
[194:27.97]Okay, course is right.

[198:04.12]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[198:06.46]Hold on, here.
