[00:05.35]Alright guys, so we gotta stick together.
[00:07.75]We're gonna have loads of zombies coming out from around every corner.
[00:11.89]For real.
[00:13.53]And you want a headshot.
[00:18.86]Oh, headshot.
[00:20.00]And they will go down.
[00:20.82]They'll keep walking without their heads, but they'll fall down if you give them enough time.
[00:24.72]Can they still hurt you if they don't have a head?
[00:26.24]If they're close enough.
[00:28.84]Oh, baby.
[00:29.34]Oh, slow motion.
[00:33.46]They're jumping over the truck over here, coming down this alley, and coming down by the ambulance as well.
[00:38.84]You don't have infinite ammo, by the way.
[00:43.60]Yeah, you don't have infinite ammo.
[00:46.73]How come I can't hit this guy?
[00:49.15]Triple cheese with the knife.
[00:52.51]He's going in.
[00:53.57]I mean, I got more melee damage, don't I?
[00:55.55]Might as well use it.
[00:57.40]Yeah, you'll be able to buy other melee weapons.
[00:59.22]Watch out, they're coming in behind you guys still.
[01:01.08]Oh my god.
[01:01.94]Whoa, I can't move.
[01:03.18]Oh my god, you're so screwed, Boop.
[01:05.14]Oh, yeah.
[01:07.20]Why can't I move?
[01:08.10]Because they're like holding on to me.
[01:09.98]Yeah.
[01:10.68]It's kind of like in Left 4 Dead where if you're getting hit, you can't really move.
[01:14.52]Right.
[01:15.58]I say that like an expert, this is my first time actually playing this game.
[01:20.33]And you can also buy combat armor and grenades on the bottom left.
[01:23.41]I highly advise armor.
[01:26.64]Well, I spent all my money.
[01:28.42]OH MY GOD, THEY ALL JUST APPEARED IN THE CHURCH!
[01:32.22]I can see them jumping down after you.
[01:34.22]What the- oh!
[01:35.79]Oops.
[01:36.05]There we go.
[01:37.71]Oh, welcome to Scare, like Scare Saturday!
[01:41.75]I feel like dual pistols are maybe not such a good investment, I have no process.
[01:45.25]I know, seriously!
[01:49.19]Sprinting as fast as I can.
[01:51.01]Hey, don't lock me up.
[01:53.06]Hey, I found Duke!
[01:54.57]There he is.
[01:55.41]He was defending another sector of West London.
[01:57.59]What's going on?
[01:58.59]He's got like a fraction of his... What's going on?
[02:00.26]Why is this...?
[02:01.52]Brett welded it, didn't he?
[02:05.02]How do you de-weld a door?
[02:07.82]You press 5 twice, and then I think middle mouse click.
[02:11.02]Hopefully no one wanted to buy anything.
[02:13.04]I'm abusing the game mechanics because you guys don't know how it works.
[02:20.31]How do you deal with those big chainsaw guys?
[02:21.81]They're meaty.
[02:24.69]I'll go this one right there.
[02:25.49]Go get him, Triple Cheese.
[02:28.43]Jesus.
[02:29.78]Should I be like just walking up and smashing people from Berserker?
[02:58.86]Uh, theoretically?
[02:59.90]You might die.
[03:01.60]Yeah, it's a dangerous job.
[03:02.82]They might be able to smash you a little bit harder.
[03:05.34]You know what?
[03:06.00]We're going to start crushing people like this.
[03:08.54]Good luck with that.
[03:10.21]Oh, good.
[03:10.67]I got 55 health now.
[03:12.65]You need to be buying... Why are you not buying armor?
[03:14.99]I don't know.
[03:16.83]I didn't know that was a thing.
[03:19.01]What's Duke doing?
[03:20.59]Dude, you've got no armor.
[03:24.01]I don't know, he's pretty crazy out there.
[03:25.59]He's about to get snuck up on by a load of people.
[03:30.23]He's got a chainsaw guy who, oh.
[03:32.49]Oh my god.
[03:32.87]Chainsaw guy's got nothing on me.
[03:36.51]Triple cheese was killed by chainsaw guy.
[03:40.51]I got killed by a snake.
[03:41.97]It said Skrake.
[03:42.87]I think their names are Skrakes.
[03:44.59]I don't remember which one's a Skrake.
[03:45.95]Yeah, I got bit by a snake like in my heel and it killed me.
[03:49.57]Does he have a chain gun?
[03:51.97]Oh, this guy's like the meat grinder dude.
[03:55.23]Oh, wow, thank goodness I killed him.
[03:56.63]Oh, Christ.
[03:57.07]Help!
[04:00.71]Oh, I'm trying to... I now have my A12 shotgun.
[04:10.08]Yeah!
[04:13.12]There's a lot of people coming over here.
[04:18.54]This guy is relentless!
[04:19.66]Oh!
[04:20.91]Kill this Jack!
[04:22.89]Triple cheese!
[04:23.93]You need to buy body armor!
[04:25.51]I tried to, but I didn't have enough time.
[04:28.98]Alright, now you can buy things, Jroma.
[04:30.80]Buy specifically the body armor, yeah.
[04:33.10]Get armor!
[04:34.00]Let me get body armor for the first time this whole game.
[04:36.82]Oh, this guy's gonna jump right into the axe!
[04:39.21]Help, help, help, help!
[04:40.07]Where are you?
[04:40.59]Help me!
[04:41.11]You're not even by us.
[04:42.09]Oh wow, you really do need help.
[04:45.98]Oh, you got him.
[04:46.40]I think he's gonna kill me.
[04:47.77]Ow.
[04:48.09]Run towards the tunnel.
[04:49.01]Run towards the tunnel.
[04:49.63]You're running towards all the other enemies.
[04:51.21]Oh, I thought you went in there.
[04:54.07]Oh, I'm getting destroyed.
[04:56.17]Oh, no.
[04:57.27]Oh, no.
[04:57.79]Bump squeeze.
[04:58.73]We lost him.
[04:59.31]This chainsaw guy's still here.
[05:01.05]Oh, no.
[05:03.05]There goes Triple G. Oh, no.
[05:04.99]I can't heal anyone.
[05:05.95]I'm a failure.
[05:06.67]17 seconds.
[05:09.41]We can do it.
[05:09.92]Boom.
[05:11.36]Hey, do you guys want me to buy you a gun or something?
[05:29.33]What is Vlad the Impaler?
[05:30.57]What is this?
[05:31.25]Is this a shotgun?
[05:31.87]Shotgun, yeah.
[05:33.17]Does anyone want a gun?
[05:34.03]I have an extra.
[05:35.47]At least I got... I need a gun.
[05:38.32]Oh, they're coming to the front door!
[05:40.68]Oh, my God.
[05:41.62]Oh, my dear Jesus.
[05:42.98]Everyone, use all of the guns.
[05:45.46]Whoa.
[05:47.52]Use all of the guns.
[05:48.66]Oh, jeez.
[05:50.86]I can't see.
[05:51.42]Oh, man.
[05:52.40]Yeah, it's so dark in here.
[05:54.28]Oh, no.
[05:56.88]Oh, man.
[05:57.46]We are trapped.
[05:59.16]We are legitimately trapped in this room.
[06:02.50]Is this the only place they can come from?
[06:04.66]I don't know.
[06:05.10]I'm sure we'll find out.
[06:09.97]George Jerma, do you want a gun?
[06:12.93]Come in this corner.
[06:15.62]Come back in the back.
[06:18.68]Yeah, Mac-10.
[06:19.46]It's not the best gun, but it's a gun.
[06:22.16]At least it's better than the 9mm.
[06:25.00]Oh, they're dropping in from the roof in here.
[06:26.58]On the floor, on the floor.
[06:27.96]What's hitting?
[06:28.36]There's people in here!
[06:29.10]There's people in here!
[06:31.03]They really are dropping from the roof.
[06:33.25]Alright, they're going outside.
[06:33.95]They're going outside.
[06:34.51]Let's go outside.
[06:36.24]What's killing this stuff?
[06:37.38]I need help.
[06:38.98]I healed you, but I don't know if it's enough.
[06:41.04]I'm gonna come heal you too, Triple.
[06:42.26]She's running me.
[06:42.89]I'm good.
[06:43.15]I'm good.
[06:43.91]Ow.
[06:45.19]There, I healed you.
[06:46.37]I got you just in time.
[06:47.73]You don't understand how close to death you were.
[06:50.25]That was... I know.
[06:51.91]I'm healing Duke, but I don't know if it's gonna be enough.
[06:55.74]Oh, I even healed him, and it wasn't enough.
[07:01.46]Oh, I'm... Holy God!
[07:05.29]Don't kill me, man!
[07:07.45]Don't kill me, man!
[07:09.89]I'm gonna die.
[07:10.73]Wow, you're healing me, thank goodness.
[07:12.77]Keep going!
[07:16.97]No!
[07:19.17]Oh no, stealth's been killed.
[07:20.31]We're totally wiping here.
[07:21.35]Don't say that.
[07:24.60]Don't say that!
[07:27.86]Do I have no mana?
[07:32.07]Boo, are you out of ammo?
[07:33.51]It says I don't have a gun on my screen.
[07:35.33]Oh, wait, I have a knife now.
[07:36.99]I've been wandering around for ages mashing buttons.
[07:41.01]What's going on?
[07:42.50]Hit the number keys to pull your gun out.
[07:44.72]There's only Five Guys.
[07:47.12]Sick grenade I just did right there.
[07:48.42]I'm glad that, like, worked out.
[07:51.20]I have so little ammo.
[07:53.24]All I got is my melee.
[07:55.03]Alright, guys, I'm going in.
[07:57.35]Oh, never mind.
[07:58.81]I got it under control.
[08:00.71]Money, money, money.
[08:02.37]I'm like ready to go this time.
[08:04.01]Alright, let's go.
[08:05.49]You're not ready for this.
[08:07.70]Ready for what?
[08:08.34]What are we doing?
[08:13.70]And he's invisible.
[08:14.88]He's invisible by the way.
[08:15.82]Are you serious?
[08:16.58]He's invisible?
[08:17.82]There he is, there he is in the middle of the street.
[08:20.40]There's tons of streets, Etalyx.
[08:22.36]Yeah, but I see the smoke.
[08:23.40]He's like smoking.
[08:24.60]He's in the middle of like the big one.
[08:25.92]Oh, wait.
[08:27.70]Is he the smoke?
[08:29.20]Is he running?
[08:29.60]Where is he now?
[08:30.74]He's in the smoke.
[08:33.47]He disappeared.
[08:35.41]Big guy's to our right.
[08:36.19]To our right?
[08:40.47]There he is.
[08:41.61]Oh!
[08:41.95]Oh!
[08:42.29]Jesus!
[08:42.55]He's killed!
[08:43.42]Oh, triple cheese.
[08:44.60]Duke has died!
[08:45.34]Duke!
[08:46.60]Where'd he go?
[08:47.70]Oh, there he is.
[08:48.54]He's still... Triple cheese!
[08:49.58]I'm healing triple cheese.
[08:54.06]Oh, there's a grenade launcher on the ground.
[08:56.24]Is he inside?
[08:56.68]Yeah, that's Duke's.
[08:57.39]I think he's in the church.
[08:57.97]I think he's in here, healing.
[08:59.03]I have no idea, actually.
[09:01.81]I'm in here with you.
[09:05.67]He decides to come out and kill one of us.
[09:07.53]I'm gonna try this weapon.
[09:11.15]I've lost all my armor.
[09:12.55]I'm coming back outside.
[09:13.65]I thought he came in the church.
[09:14.89]Alright.
[09:17.50]I dropped my gun, so if anyone wants to pick up an extra submachine gun, it's on the ground.
[09:20.96]Oh, there he is!
[09:25.12]Uh-oh.
[09:25.44]Triple cheese!
[09:25.78]Oh, the patriarch killed triple cheese!
[09:27.94]He's still alive!
[09:28.62]What was that?
[09:29.44]Was that a rocket?
[09:31.70]He hit me with some of that, too.
[09:33.70]Oh, yeah, we got him!
[09:34.74]Yeah!
[09:35.54]Oh, baby.
[09:36.06]Yeah!
[09:38.42]Woof!
[09:40.71]Your squad survived.
[09:42.75]Now press B as fast as you can, everybody.
[09:46.38]Fountains of money.
[09:48.42]Money, money, money.
[09:50.47]Rest in peace, Jerma.
[09:52.57]And that is Killing Floor.
