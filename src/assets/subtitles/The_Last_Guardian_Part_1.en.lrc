[00:50.18]The Last Guardian.
[00:55.41]The late guardian.
[01:00.69]Come on.
[01:03.15]Come on.
[01:03.91]Hold on.
[01:04.27]Wait, wait, wait.
[01:05.19]Oh, shit.
[01:05.71]Hold on.
[01:07.68]I think the opening cutscene is happening right now.
[01:13.01]Hold on, the opening cutscene is happening.
[01:16.71]Right?
[01:21.75]Right?
[01:21.95]Where's the audio?
[01:26.19]How come I can't hear anything?
[01:30.95]Hold on, I can't press any button yet.
[01:32.25]I can't even hear what button I need to press.
[01:36.95]Quiet.
[01:37.35]We're watching the fucking cutscene.
[01:38.55]Hold on.
[01:38.87]I'm not even ready.
[01:39.55]I gotta get my coffee.
[01:42.35]It's upstairs.
[01:44.54]Ah, now I can hear.
[01:45.68]Look at that.
[01:48.82]Opening loading screen.
[01:51.34]I don't know anything about the game, man.
[01:52.64]All I know is that I've been waiting for it for a long time.
[01:58.47]Alright, so, important, before we go, uh... Come on, let's... Fucking hold on a second.
[02:04.29]We're taking an immediate tea break.
[02:05.99]I'll be right back.
[02:23.47]Wait, what?! !
[04:34.05]Okay.
[04:35.51]This fucking audio bullshit.
[04:37.24]I swear to God.
[04:38.60]No coffee, no audio.
[04:42.12]I can't, like, streaming from a console just be as easy as pressing a button.
[04:45.22]It is easy as pressing a button.
[04:48.12]You just have to have the right thing.
[04:51.43]Alright, we're here.
[04:52.43]We're ready to go.
[04:52.97]This is The Last Guardian.
[04:57.83]Thank you.
[04:58.31]Thank you for the cash.
[05:01.21]Yeah, late stream and immediate tea break.
[05:03.43]You know how it's going good.
[05:04.35]You know, we're going swell when that happens.
[05:09.11]But... Thank you, uh... Thank you, Nation22.
[05:15.82]Thank you, NekoNation.
[05:17.76]Jerma is a lazy streamer.

[06:35.74]I think Mr. Wolfgang gave 500 bits to... Let me just give you a very steep warning here.
[06:40.80]Okay?
[06:41.96]This is not going to be a comedy stream.
[06:43.86]We're not going to make any jokes.
[06:45.36]I'm not going to talk any... I'm not going to make fun of any... This is going to be a straight up chill, enjoy this masterpiece of an experience.
[06:55.04]You understand?
[06:56.06]No jokes.
[06:57.68]If I make every one joke you hear here...
[07:07.72]No jokes, this is going to be a hangout stream where we play The Last Guardian.
[07:11.28]I've been waiting for this game for like 30 years.
[07:14.18]Yeah, no swearing, no cursing.
[07:16.42]No bad language.
[07:21.65]Alright, let's... What do you say we get this started, huh?
[07:26.31]What do you guys say?
[07:31.19]Thank you, Multitrip, for the subscription.

[07:37.64]Good Guy T.Y.
[07:38.58]for the sub.
[07:39.04]And then Camel for the sub as well.
[07:43.30]Also, Huffles was the one that said, hope it's a blast.
[07:45.14]I hope it is too, because a lot of people have been waiting for this game for a long time.
[07:50.32]One of them... I was a fucking... I already broke the first rule, no swearing.
[07:55.10]We're not going to swear anymore after that one.
[07:58.48]I can guarantee you that.
[08:01.16]But thank you guys.
[08:02.84]Thank you Moeth9 for the two months.
[08:04.54]Entertain me.
[08:05.14]Well, I'm gonna try.
[08:06.10]No, no, no.
[08:07.76]We're gonna experience this game together.
[08:09.69]You know what I'm saying?
[08:11.93]This is not a stream where I'm gonna make you entertained.
[08:15.59]This is a stream where we're gonna watch a boy and his dog through a journey together.
[08:18.49]No fucking jokes.
[08:20.09]No swearing.
[08:21.18]No...
[08:23.28]Sub mode for spoilers for freedom chat a freedom chat who cares Just don't tell it.

[08:28.68]That's all I care about like I don't just don't talk shit to me Don't be mean to me Alright, let's go.
[08:36.27]Let's fucking go.
[08:36.87]We're pressing any button Let's take a look at the options camera screen audio and copyright Can I alter the copyright
[08:51.53]Come on, it's in the settings.
[08:52.39]Can't I just make this, like, Jerma LLC?
[08:56.49]That's really odd.
[08:59.46]Why would that be in the options?
[09:01.20]It's one black screen that has that on it.
[09:05.80]Okay.
[09:09.56]Audio of voices.
[09:13.50]Does this matter?
[09:14.93]Midnight mode.
[09:15.63]What does that mean?
[09:20.11]Fast chat, fast chat.
[09:21.44]Did I play Ico?
[09:22.26]I played Shadow of the Colossus and I watched somebody play Ico.
[09:27.24]Because I'm a piece of crap.
[09:28.88]And then I tried to play it myself and I just was like, I don't care.
[09:34.75]No, yes, I've played the first two games.
[09:37.45]Don't worry.
[09:37.99]Shadow of the Colossus is one of my favorite games on the PlayStation old console.
[09:44.89]All those colossi.
[09:47.91]But this is not Shadow of the Colossus.
[09:52.21]This is not that game.
[09:58.46]Subtitles, please.
[09:59.32]Okay, I'll turn them on.
[10:03.68]Camera.
[10:05.14]Standard.
[10:05.56]Camera movement speed.
[10:06.46]We can go in there later, I think.
[10:07.60]Screen.
[10:08.30]Adjust brightness.
[10:09.18]Make it a little brighter, I guess.
[10:12.15]You said no jokes?
[10:13.03]Fuck, I did say no jokes.
[10:14.09]Alright, welcome to The Last Guardian, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:19.11]New game!
[10:20.41]No laughing either.
[10:21.25]If anybody laughs at this fucking cutscene, then you're out.
[10:24.59]You're gone.
[10:26.95]Ow, fuck.
[10:29.79]I lost my headphones.
[10:30.61]Hold on, what are they saying?
[10:31.27]Alright.
[10:40.21]It's a buried sundial.
[10:47.99]Laughing children.
[10:48.59]Laughing children.
[10:49.27]Okay.
[10:49.75]Good so far.
[11:03.14]Shh.
[11:05.28]Oh, nice.
[11:06.22]Shh.
[11:16.97]People used to get attacked by bees?
[11:20.65]Okay.
[11:30.07]Bees and birds.
[11:30.76]The birds and the bees.
[11:31.50]Alright.
[11:31.80]You guys know what that means.
[11:33.74]Turn around.
[11:39.54]Fuck.
[11:49.22]EDF.
[11:49.48]Yeah, this is the EDF prequel.
[11:51.02]Shh, stop.
[11:52.52]Be quiet.
[11:54.00]This is cool.
[12:00.98]So it's showing all the different kinds of guardians.
[12:02.68]No, these are just animals.
[12:11.05]Dragon.
[12:20.26]There's the- this trico.
[12:25.89]I can't wait.
[12:26.37]I'm like shaking around right now.
[12:41.20]What is this?
[12:42.76]Showing me all kinds of weird lettering and a bright light.
[12:50.70]No, okay, what does it want me to do?
[12:56.11]It wants me to hit all the buttons.
[13:00.21]Okay, wow, alright.
[13:05.17]Alright.
[13:07.73]I do not have a PS4 Pro, so it's gonna run like shit.
[13:14.56]Wait, what?! !
[13:21.32]Damn.
[13:26.64]I think that's me.
[13:27.30]Okay, that's the breathe button.
[13:30.00]The left stick is breathe.
[13:47.46]How do you move then?
[13:48.36]Is right stick move and left stick breathe?
[13:49.90]What a fucking masterpiece.
[13:52.58]No game has ever had you have to control your breath before.
[13:55.22]And it's the left stick.
[13:55.90]Oh shit.
[13:56.12]That's it, yep.
[14:16.49]Was he chained up?
[14:17.13]So he's like this thing that used to eat people?
[14:43.11]So you wake up with these markings all over you and shit?
[14:50.59]I'M SO EXCITED!
[14:52.09]Oh god, okay.
[14:59.69]Oh god, he's not gonna be mad at me, am I?
[15:03.46]Is he?
[15:12.46]Well, I got a feeling I gotta go up to him, right?
[15:15.64]Oh boy.
[15:19.75]Shit, he can't move.
[15:21.97]He's got like a knife in his leg.
[15:23.97]Can I touch you?
[15:24.93]Are you gonna let me touch you?
[15:28.97]Oh god.
[15:30.15]Oh my god.
[15:30.67]You are so cute but scary.
[15:32.88]Please let me just take that out of you.
[15:36.94]Easy.
[15:39.12]Can I take it out of you?
[15:46.14]Can I climb up him?
[15:46.98]I'm just scared he's gonna freaking freak out or something.
[15:53.90]Easy, hold on!
[15:54.46]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[15:55.40]Hold on!
[16:03.76]Get it out!
[16:04.28]This is like, gruesome.
[16:07.88]If you remove the spear, what happens?
[16:30.08]And the game's over.
[16:39.36]Opposite of the shadow of the Colossus, yeah.
[16:41.43]Instead of driving a sword into their sacred symbols you're pulling them out.
[16:59.57]This is crazy.
[17:01.91]Yeah, I forgot, no jokes.
[17:05.91]Okay, well he's asleep?
[17:08.83]No, he's awake now.
[17:11.11]I gotta get the chain off, obviously.
[17:12.53]Okay.
[17:15.15]What does this do?
[17:22.58]Pull lever.
[17:25.66]I'd love to pull the lever.
[17:26.54]How do you jump?
[17:29.15]When I press X, all I seem to do is just go down on my knees.
[17:35.33]Okay, it's a triangle.
[17:40.08]Grab it and pull it down.
[17:41.12]Why not?
[17:41.58]Let's see what this is.
[17:43.70]I'm going to feed my dog.
[17:53.98]Pick up.
[17:54.30]Okay.
[17:59.56]Throw or drop?
[18:11.91]Here, I brought you some potatoes.
[18:13.85]Oh, wait a minute.
[18:18.62]No, no, no, wait.
[18:19.48]He's like chained up.
[18:20.24]I gotta like do better.
[18:21.32]Here, come here.
[18:26.32]Is this what you want?
[18:27.68]Oh my god, I'm sorry.
[18:31.39]That just scared me.
[18:32.81]Let's get this shit out of here.
[18:38.01]Just eat it!
[18:39.93]He keeps looking at it.
[18:40.85]That's what he wants.
[18:46.63]I'm trying to feed you.
[18:47.89]This is what you want, right?
[18:50.35]Here.
[18:53.23]Right?
[18:53.43]Is that what you want?
[18:55.10]You can get that now.
[18:58.39]Get it.
[19:01.86]He's kind of just looking at it.
[19:02.90]Is there more of them?
[19:05.30]Maybe we have to put them all in there?
[19:06.82]Oh, there's one up there.
[19:07.46]Okay, I can climb like that, I guess.
[19:22.69]Okay.
[19:23.21]No, pick it up.
[19:23.75]Don't sneak over to it.
[19:27.30]Should I put it, like, right in front of his face?
[19:29.70]Last time I did that, he got really mad at me.
[19:34.46]Alright, I'm gonna throw it.
[19:36.70]See?
[19:36.82]There you go.
[19:40.02]You can... You can eat it.
[19:41.44]Go on.
[19:43.30]Go on.
[19:45.57]Oh, there we go.
[19:46.21]That's like a vitamin ball.
[19:53.27]So, I'll do the same thing with the other one.
[19:56.75]Here you go, don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you.
[19:58.41]Do the same thing.
[20:03.95]There, I won't even get near you.
[20:05.05]Have some.
[20:15.58]What is even in there?
[20:16.30]He's like eating wood.
[20:18.50]Is that good?
[20:25.25]Are we friends now?
[20:26.47]No, not yet.
[20:27.53]We're not quite friends yet.
[20:29.28]Not quite.
[20:29.78]Alright, there's one up there.
[20:33.68]Go ahead and jump.
[20:42.48]Climb up, let go.
[20:43.82]Yeah, I don't want to let go.
[20:44.98]Climb and move is with the left stick.
[20:46.44]Alright.
[20:48.66]Can I get under here?
[20:50.98]I can.
[20:55.71]Can I jump with this?
[20:58.20]No.
[21:01.00]It's so funny playing this, like, little kid.
[21:03.14]I don't know.
[21:04.16]Do I have any special moves?
[21:06.20]Or do I just throw food to my dog?
[21:09.90]God, this is so immersive.
[21:10.80]I feel like you're so taken aback.
[21:11.94]Like, usually you get, like, a sword.
[21:13.06]You can go, like, one, two, three, X, X, X for a combo.
[21:15.94]Nope.
[21:16.18]Go ahead.
[21:18.90]Eat that last one.
[21:24.10]Alright, I'm backing up.
[21:25.76]I'm not gonna try to take your food.
[21:26.88]It's not like a bone.
[21:27.68]Alright, I gotta get the chain off.
[21:37.59]Press R1 to pull the gun out.
[21:38.99]He's standing up now.
[21:44.07]He's still fucked up.
[21:46.15]Is it a sword in his neck?
[21:48.34]Something on his neck?
[21:50.62]I think there's something on him right here.
[21:52.48]Easy.
[21:53.36]I just, like, slapped him.
[21:55.14]No, no, easy, easy, easy.
[21:56.34]Okay.
[22:06.79]Gotta get that spear out.
[22:11.24]There we go.
[22:16.10]He keeps kicking my ass.
[22:17.50]He's like knocking me unconscious.
[22:21.06]Every time.
[22:23.45]Hey, let me pull this spear out of you.
[22:25.17]Please give me a second concussion in 30 minutes.
[22:35.29]How's the audio?
[22:35.79]Is it too loud?
[22:36.49]Is the game too loud?
[22:37.25]Am I too soft?
[22:38.27]How's it good?
[22:43.29]In the meantime, thank you, uh, TheRealActualForRealGerman, thanks for six months.
[22:47.07]DrickGame for two months.
[22:48.45]LolBears, DeathFate, KingDoo, and TheFuriousBear.

[22:55.80]DumpusRumpus, thanks for the sub.
[22:57.12]Olvulisk, thanks for two months.
[22:59.80]Nightfang, eh, Nightfang7, thanks a lot, man.
[23:03.40]Welcome, guys.
[23:07.45]Left stick to breathe, right?
[23:10.19]So now he's like, he's friends with them.
[23:21.55]Kinda sounds like a T-Rex.
[23:22.43]Paul Trico.
[23:22.83]Okay, so it's R1.
[23:35.17]He's itchy!
[23:36.56]Oh, that's so cool.
[23:41.18]Can I get him to rip the cord off?
[23:42.48]Okay, let's say I get him to move around.
[23:49.59]Let me explore this for a second.
[23:56.57]It looks like an opening, somehow.
[23:59.96]Can he, like, run through this?
[24:04.05]Can I, like, jump up on this thing?
[24:06.37]Can I just unhook the collar from him?
[24:12.51]Hold on.
[24:15.07]Come here.
[24:18.33]I wanna see if I can get on that collar.
[24:22.15]Come here, you.
[24:23.18]Come here.
[24:24.18]Can I just unhook it?
[24:27.56]I wonder if there's, like, a little hook on it.
[24:31.66]Yeah, there it is.
[24:35.29]That's good.
[24:37.09]Alright, hold on.
[24:39.38]Slow down.
[24:39.80]Let go.
[24:40.10]Alright, let me see.
[24:40.84]What else do we need to do here?
[24:44.86]Okay, let's let go.
[24:45.60]Um...
[24:57.07]That's really the only place we can go.
[24:58.19]I was gonna say, hopefully it doesn't kill me.
[25:00.91]Is there, like, fall damage in this game?
[25:03.13]Or can we just go out the way we came in this way?
[25:04.81]Come over here, buddy.
[25:11.02]Ooh.
[25:18.88]Um, I guess we can go this way.
[25:20.16]Let's see what's over here.
[25:22.95]Oh, there's food over here.
[25:25.01]You hungry?
[25:36.63]Is he just going to eat it?
[25:38.53]Is he just going to pick it up with his hands?
[25:40.13]That's the most adorable thing I've ever seen.
[25:44.65]He's just going to pick it up with his paw.
[25:52.72]Here, eat it.
[25:53.26]Here, take it.
[25:59.94]Oh, shit!
[26:04.60]I thought I just hit him in the face.
[26:05.80]No, he caught it apparently.
[26:07.52]Get the other one.
[26:12.70]Is it too far away?
[26:13.38]Oh, you got it.
[26:16.61]That is so funny.
[26:19.95]This is crazy.
[26:21.93]He's like playing with his food.
[26:25.69]Go on, get it.
[26:26.19]Ah, yes.
[26:26.47]Hahaha.
[26:33.14]Is there a hole here?
[26:35.70]Can I go in here?
[26:38.65]There is a hole in here.
[26:42.09]Jokes two, swears five.
[26:46.63]I guess I can go in here.
[26:47.65]Okay.
[26:56.30]Like a cave.
[26:58.78]Kind of bumping into shit.
[27:01.44]No, no, no.
[27:01.68]I don't want to go back in.
[27:06.96]Let's make sure I don't go too fast here.
[27:08.30]I want to see.
[27:10.52]Cutest sidekick?
[27:11.28]Yeah, who is the sidekick?
[27:12.12]I think I'm the sidekick right now.
[27:13.46]A little... What the hell is this?
[27:22.75]Squeeze through here?
[27:23.53]Oh, this is bright.
[27:27.41]What's wrong with me?
[27:35.11]This is freaking me out.
[27:39.60]Where are you?
[27:40.14]Where's my friend?
[27:42.69]Alright, which one did I come in?
[27:45.11]What the fuck is this?
[27:53.85]Alright, something I learned from every game.
[27:57.47]Don't ever steal ancient artifacts.
[28:01.17]I just did.
[28:01.61]Is this a shield?
[28:03.22]Pull down, circle, and move the left stick to shine the mirror's light.
[28:05.80]Oh, Ima Gakuno.
[28:11.40]Okay.
[28:14.16]It's really cold in here apparently.
[28:21.55]Okay, so wield it or put it away.
[28:25.07]Okay, so that's how you put it on and then you hold down... Jeez.
[28:29.21]What the hell is this for?
[28:37.48]Okay.
[28:38.42]Let's put it away for now.
[28:39.84]Wait.
[28:40.04]Do I have to, like, shine it on something?
[28:41.42]Like, shine it on here?
[28:45.02]Yeah, I'm just gonna borrow it.
[28:47.48]Don't worry.
[28:47.80]I'm just gonna borrow it for a few hours.
[28:50.19]How long is this game?
[28:50.89]After I bring this back, I'll bring the disc back.
[28:54.01]I promise.
[28:57.29]Well, I guess that's all I can do in here.
[29:04.83]Maybe I can shine it on Trico.
[29:07.81]Gonna give him extra powers.
[29:12.44]Where is that up there?
[29:15.08]It's very cramped in here.
[29:16.24]Where's the little hole?
[29:17.88]There it is.
[29:21.00]Captain America 4.
[29:27.38]Can I do the laser pointer thing like a cat with tricot?
[29:29.75]That's probably what you do.
[29:30.79]You probably aim it and he jumps on it or something.
[29:37.12]I'm back.
[29:38.64]Hopefully you're still... I thought he was dead.
[29:42.37]I think he was waiting for me.
[29:44.67]What a good boy.
[29:48.41]Yeah, alright, yeah.
[29:49.13]It's got some synergy thing he's gonna look at.
[30:00.08]Why is there a ray of reflecting?
[30:01.56]No jokes!
[30:02.14]No fucking jokes.
[30:03.22]Stop.
[30:03.50]This is important.
[30:08.05]Okay, weren't there a couple of walls that looked like they could be broken?
[30:14.35]I mean, this looks kind of not that sturdy, right?
[30:17.17]Let's just see what happens.
[30:18.87]You, go that way.
[30:21.42]What the fuck?
[30:24.10]He has electricity?
[30:28.42]He can fucking zap?
[30:30.36]Oh boy, this game just got so much better.
[30:33.58]What?
[30:33.80]This is so crazy.
[30:45.20]The Last Guardian!
[30:50.49]He can zap boys and girls.
[30:52.25]You know what that means.
[30:52.93]We're zapping everybody.
[30:58.17]Yeah, there was a wall back here I thought I could... It didn't look that sturdy.
[31:03.08]Any more secrets in here?
[31:03.86]Let's make sure I didn't miss any secrets.
[31:06.56]Hey, you know what?
[31:06.98]Go ahead.
[31:07.18]Just zap in there.
[31:09.02]You like secrets in there?
[31:10.66]No, don't do that.
[31:11.16]I'm gonna fucking die.
[31:11.82]It's gonna zap me.
[31:14.61]Is this wall back here, right?
[31:16.15]Yeah, it looks like a bag of shit wall.
[31:18.59]We can probably zap it.
[31:20.31]Zap that wall!
[31:24.25]Nice!
[31:29.34]Oh man, that was cool.
[31:33.04]That was cool.
[31:34.80]Alright, come on in.
[31:43.83]Is this on PC?
[31:44.53]No, this is on PS4 only.
[31:46.35]Unfortunately.
[31:46.95]Keep coming, buddy!
[31:51.23]Not scared of him at all, huh?
[31:54.13]That is so... That is like almost too much to handle right now.
[31:58.23]Okay, this is awesome.
[32:15.69]It's a PS4 exclusive.
[32:16.65]It's by the team Ico.
[32:19.03]Shadow of the Colossus.
[32:20.39]Ico.
[32:21.71]And The Last Guardian.
[32:23.03]Which is the game that we're playing right now.
[32:27.79]Hopefully, can he... Be careful up here, man.
[32:29.65]You're pretty big.
[32:30.81]Let's go take a look.
[32:35.75]I need to... I don't... Don't rush this.
[32:38.72]We're waiting a long time to see this shit.
[32:40.28]I want to look in the cavern.
[32:44.46]Ah.
[32:50.07]Hey, Trico, I have something for you to do.
[32:51.99]Get rid of all these old pots and pans.
[33:00.92]That is really loud.
[33:02.70]Is that too loud?
[33:03.42]I feel like that might be a little too loud.
[33:07.00]But, you know, sometimes when there's a zap, you want it to be loud, right?
[33:13.74]Jump?
[33:15.59]You want me to jump?
[33:18.18]I'm not jumping off this shit.
[33:19.92]No.
[33:20.18]We're not even out of the first chapter.
[33:22.04]I'm not gonna jump.
[33:26.51]Okay.
[33:27.75]We're gonna look a little... This is cool.
[33:31.53]Where is he?
[33:34.46]Come on.
[33:37.10]Come on, you.
[33:39.04]We've gotta go take a bath.
[33:45.29]Okay.
[33:46.89]I think we just... Well, I see some stuff over there.
[33:51.84]I also see... Why don't we just go for it?
[33:56.68]You want to go for it?
[33:59.04]Let's go.
[34:03.72]I'm going for it.
[34:04.32]Let's go for a swim.
[34:10.41]Come on in.
[34:11.53]Please tell me he jumps in.
[34:14.86]Here he comes.
[34:16.14]Here he comes.
[34:18.54]He's like, should I do it?
[34:19.94]I don't think I should do it.
[34:22.14]Come on, you can do it.
[34:23.44]It's not that bad.
[34:24.16]The water's fine.
[34:25.44]He doesn't like water.
[34:29.30]He doesn't want to use the water.
[34:31.11]Okay.
[34:33.93]Well, it looks like he doesn't come in here.
[34:41.20]There's stuff over there, but I'm just gonna go all the way to the side.
[34:42.99]Come on, you know, don't be such a baby.
[34:44.45]Get in here.
[34:46.31]Maybe he's too heavy.
[34:48.33]Hold on, what's over here?
[34:50.11]No, let's put the shield away for now.
[34:56.32]Okay, there's that.
[34:59.82]Anything else over here?
[35:02.10]Any secret jugs?
[35:03.06]Can I bring him to a food jug?
[35:06.35]Where are they?
[35:06.77]I know they're, like, probably everywhere.
[35:11.46]I guess not.
[35:12.80]All those bunches stood over there.
[35:16.58]Down this way.
[35:17.20]We can go up there.
[35:20.39]Let's go.
[35:20.97]I'm going to look at this stuff first.
[35:22.45]There's like a carriage over here.
[35:24.39]Let's go check it out.
[35:28.69]Alright.
[35:30.81]What do we got?
[35:31.33]You can zap that.
[35:33.10]Let's go ahead and make him do that.
[35:34.26]Hopefully he doesn't hit me, so we'll leave him out of the way.
[35:36.16]Hey, Trico.
[35:39.14]I've got something.
[35:43.00]You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.
[35:44.74]Can you electrocute that door, please?
[35:50.78]Thank you!
[35:54.92]I could go around to walk up, but we'll just go straight through for now.
[35:58.43]Ooh, there's a chain.
[36:06.87]Climb the chain.
[36:14.43]Anywhere... Oh, I see some food barrels!
[36:16.59]I see some food!
[36:18.77]Can I just jump off?
[36:20.55]I think I can, right?
[36:25.53]Slide around.
[36:27.27]Climb all the way up.
[36:28.99]Don't leave him.
[36:30.21]Is it too loud?
[36:30.97]I can change that a little bit.
[36:32.95]That might be better.
[36:34.59]Let me know if it's too soft at this point.
[36:39.68]Let's just go.
[36:41.64]I got some food here.
[36:45.34]Can I pick up the whole thing?
[36:48.42]I can.
[36:49.88]But... Wouldn't this not be good?
[36:53.18]Considering he can't get in here?
[36:56.34]He can't swim.
[36:57.62]Then he won't... Well, we'll just see what we can do with this.
[37:08.64]I'm just going to push it over the edge.
[37:13.30]To drain the water or something eventually here?
[37:17.76]Make sure I'm not doing something stupid here.
[37:21.10]No, I feel like this is what you gotta do.
[37:27.50]Please push it forward.
[37:29.34]I know you're just a little boy, but come on.
[37:35.47]Please do not kill me.
[37:37.41]How do I hang?
[37:39.77]Just told me how.
[37:40.35]I don't want to jump.
[37:42.31]I want to hang.
[37:46.62]Well, let's find out if this kills me.
[37:49.04]Just out of curiosity.
[37:52.18]No, I'm fine.
[37:53.06]Okay, cool.
[37:56.68]Alright, dog.
[38:00.61]I've got treats.
[38:02.35]Look what I got.
[38:05.27]You want to come in the water now?
[38:06.49]I bet you do.
[38:10.31]What if I throw it in the water?
[38:11.21]Will he jump in the water?
[38:13.76]Oh, no.
[38:14.78]Alright, look.
[38:15.46]Go get it!
[38:15.86]It's in the water!
[38:19.76]You gotta go get it now.
[38:20.60]I ain't gonna help you.
[38:27.32]Come on.
[38:30.53]There he goes!
[38:36.37]He's trying to find it.
[38:38.87]He's like, what'd you do with it?
[38:39.75]You threw it in here somewhere.
[38:42.80]Did he get it?
[38:43.18]It's very good.
[38:47.02]What's wrong?
[38:50.06]Why is he not eating that?
[38:50.88]I think he hit his face on the wood.
[38:56.92]Okay.
[38:59.99]There's a couple more barrels here.
[39:03.35]We'll feed him.
[39:07.73]Hey, look at what I got.
[39:08.77]Food for you.
[39:12.37]He caught it in midair.
[39:13.41]What a good catch.
[39:15.11]My dog does that too sometimes, doesn't he?
[39:20.02]This is like wet food.
[39:20.96]This is the good shit.
[39:22.34]This ain't no random shitty ass dry food.
[39:25.28]Hey.
[39:26.76]Why am I doing that?
[39:27.88]I can do that in the game.
[39:29.00]Why am I doing that in real life?
[39:31.80]Come here.
[39:33.79]Get over here.
[39:36.37]Look what I got.
[39:39.11]It's a box full of cookies.
[39:48.20]He missed it.
[39:50.66]He's getting pissed off.
[39:52.66]He's pissing himself off because he can't get it.
[39:56.91]Get it!
[39:57.21]There you go.
[40:07.43]Alright, that was all three of those.
[40:08.69]Now he's down here, so... What can we do down here?
[40:12.03]I guess is the question.
[40:14.53]What are you looking at?
[40:15.17]Up there?
[40:18.51]Do you see something?
[40:19.83]What is it, boy?
[40:20.65]Do you see something, boy?
[40:23.71]Whoa, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy!
[40:27.33]Easy!
[40:29.33]Hey!
[40:30.90]Wait for me!
[40:35.20]Don't just leave without me, dog.
[40:36.36]Give me your tail.
[40:39.48]Hey!
[40:41.12]Where are you going?
[40:42.78]Stay back here.
[40:43.44]I can't go that far.
[40:48.00]Yeah, you left me behind.
[40:54.40]Come on, put your tail down here.
[40:55.82]Let me grab it.
[40:56.92]Come grab me.
[41:01.17]Don't!
[41:04.17]Alright, there we go.
[41:07.33]You wanted me to come down?
[41:09.67]Alright, let's do it.
[41:12.08]Back up there.
[41:14.14]You know where to go.
[41:14.70]Let's do it.
[41:16.58]Here we go.
[41:25.65]Alright, we good?
[41:26.15]Don't, what are you, don't shoot me!
[41:31.79]Okay, I'm letting go.
[41:36.90]Okay, if I'm a regular human, all my bones are broken.
[41:44.26]Okay, what's in here?
[41:49.08]stuff.
[41:51.56]He snapped my neck, if that's in real life.
[41:53.20]Can I climb?
[41:56.38]I wonder where I need to go.
[42:01.58]Maybe the thing that's bright is telling me to go in.
[42:08.52]Cutscene.
[42:16.39]He's not here, though.
[42:22.22]Trico!
[42:22.66]Oh.
[42:25.20]Oh, goodbye?
[42:26.04]Oh, no.
[42:26.88]That can't be goodbye.
[42:28.27]Look at him.
[42:29.31]I can't give him any more food?
[42:32.53]Well...
[42:51.41]Can I jump up there?
[42:56.46]Can I open this?
[42:57.62]Come on.
[42:58.14]I'm really strong.
[43:01.94]That's bright.
[43:09.05]No, he's like, I'm coming with you.
[43:11.11]Go home.
[43:21.79]No, he's running away.
[43:28.07]Oh boy.
[43:35.43]This is really cool.
[43:46.76]I'm already crying.
[43:49.47]Let's get fucked away.
[44:16.72]We are.
[44:17.32]We are certainly chugging right now.
[44:21.49]I am at like probably like 18 frames a second right now.
[44:28.97]Okay.
[44:31.10]Wow, that's a drop.
[44:37.08]Okay, well.
[44:39.30]I just want to look around.
[44:40.20]Don't do anything crazy.
[44:44.92]Any food or anything?
[44:45.87]I just want to see.
[44:46.93]I mean, we have to know, right?
[44:50.77]We kind of have to know.
[44:51.51]No, we don't have to know.
[44:52.83]No jokes.
[44:53.41]This is not a joke stream.
[44:57.53]I think we have to get up there eventually, right?
[45:03.40]What are you doing?
[45:06.18]Are you just like... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[45:13.38]Come over here.
[45:13.78]Let's go to this thing.
[45:15.36]Come here.
[45:16.50]Come over here.
[45:19.20]I feel like we can jump to this.
[45:23.20]Can we?
[45:23.42]I don't know.
[45:25.97]We're about to find out.
[45:31.59]Let me get on your back.
[45:33.33]Alright.
[45:37.23]Go that way.
[45:38.61]We can go that way, I think.
[45:41.22]Go for it.
[45:43.00]You know what you want to do?
[45:44.32]You want to jump over there.
[45:49.68]Come on.
[45:52.12]Go for it.
[45:53.82]Wait, what?
[45:54.52]Wait, maybe he can't jump over there.
[45:56.74]He's like, I don't think I can do that.
[46:01.79]No, I guess not.
[46:02.39]Let me see what else there is.
[46:05.95]Let me grab onto that way.
[46:13.94]Let's take a look.
[46:20.93]That looks like the only real way to go, I thought.
[46:27.77]Camera, please.
[46:32.49]I don't think so.
[46:43.68]There's a ledge over here.
[46:54.83]What happens if I just jump?
[46:55.79]I'm just gonna try it.
[46:56.95]Fuck it, who cares, right?
[47:01.26]Okay, that's not... Okay, well.
[47:09.74]Let's, uh, let's not... I don't jump over there.
[47:16.64]We were talking about broken back, so that's a broken back.
[47:27.75]No, that wasn't a joke stream.
[47:30.43]Ooh, wait a minute.
[47:31.38]What is this?
[47:33.78]Would you look at that?
[47:37.10]I can do this.
[47:41.64]You didn't save.
[47:45.43]Okay, I see things to jump on to Should I go all the way down first and see what's down here?
[48:01.69]Finally that didn't take very long Let's jump up here
[48:14.48]Oh, see, I knew he could do that.
[48:15.92]I just wanted to ride you while you did that.
[48:19.85]Well, you just keep following me.
[48:21.24]We're gonna go this way, buddy.
[48:27.87]Yeah, I'm not... By the way, I want to make sure I address this.
[48:33.24]I'm not looking at my words.
[48:37.28]So if you're subbing or giving bits, thank you so much.
[48:39.16]But when I get a break, once I get a spot to sit down and read them, I will.
[48:44.62]Thank you, everybody that's subbing.
[48:48.72]Oh, you are right behind me, aren't you?
[48:52.16]Much appreciated, guys.
[48:59.14]Curl yourself into the pit.
[49:00.26]We just did that already.
[49:08.47]Dog, you are freaking me out.
[49:18.08]Okay.
[49:19.88]We've made it to the other side.
[49:20.96]Let's see what we got.
[49:24.26]Anything up here?
[49:25.22]No, not really.
[49:29.36]I can definitely blow that door with the sap.
[49:33.70]There you are.
[49:36.22]Uh, you know that door over there?
[49:39.44]Blast it!
[49:39.92]That's convenient.
[49:57.52]It was convenient for a second.
[49:58.86]Now it's inconvenient.
[50:00.90]You okay?
[50:06.64]Alright, well... I'll see you on the other side.
[50:09.88]I just did that really, really... I'm just doing this so haphazardly.
[50:16.98]That was not smart.
[50:19.96]Disc away.
[50:21.46]Let me move this over here.
[50:23.00]Alright.
[50:25.36]Nothing this way.
[50:28.27]Let's go in the red tunnel.
[50:33.59]I love his pee-pee run.
[50:34.69]That's the only way I can describe that.
[50:37.67]His pee-pee run.
[50:38.43]I gotta go pee-pee.
[50:40.71]No jokes.
[50:41.75]I already made that fucking rule.
[50:44.61]Okay.
[50:46.58]Looks like... Got a couple openings.
[50:53.14]How did you get in here?
[50:54.38]That fast?
[50:54.82]I don't know.
[51:00.67]He can't come that way.
[51:06.25]This is very big and open.
[51:07.27]Does that lead exactly to right here, too?
[51:11.43]It does.
[51:12.07]Hello.
[51:13.53]Hello, doggo.
[51:15.71]You can't... You can't fit in here.
[51:19.67]Don't get stuck.
[51:20.27]We're gonna have to, like, butter you up.
[51:23.22]It's okay.
[51:24.18]No, you don't have to... I'll find another way.
[51:30.47]Stop trying to squeeze in here.
[51:31.65]You're going to get stuck.
[51:33.03]Like that Winnie the Pooh episode.
[51:36.80]Okay, let's take a look.
[51:39.98]What's that?
[51:41.70]Oh, there's another guardian.
[51:42.76]Can I pick him up?
[51:51.74]He just like zaps him.
[51:55.22]Oh, I can go that way.
[51:56.40]Or what's this?
[51:58.32]Let me take a look all the way around.
[51:59.88]I don't want to miss anything.
[52:01.18]Like a dummy.
[52:06.54]No.
[52:08.30]I'll try straight on first.
[52:11.70]Crystal lizard.
[52:12.18]Yeah, I'm going to get some twinkling Titanite if I kill that thing.
[52:17.81]Okay, that's just a closed door.
[52:19.33]We've got to go up to the right.
[52:23.06]Ooh, he's still trying to squish his head through.
[52:25.19]This is so adorable.
[52:29.05]Like, I wish... I wish I had this animal.
[52:32.49]I already have my little Otto, but look at him.
[52:36.33]He so badly wants to come see me.
[52:41.89]I already missed five secrets.
[52:44.55]Oh, we're doing an inside joke, aren't we?
[52:47.17]And I mean that as... Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute!
[52:48.97]You thought I missed a secret, huh?
[52:51.31]Thought I missed a fucking secret?
[52:52.89]Well... I see that there's... I can't get it right now, but... Once Doggo gets up here, there's a... There's a picnic basket in there he can eat.
[53:03.45]Yeah, he thought I was gonna miss that one.
[53:07.05]Nope.
[53:14.57]Okay, this is where we blew the door.
[53:22.09]Just out of curiosity.
[53:23.03]Come over here for a second.
[53:24.89]Let me get a good look at you.
[53:30.45]Anything on this side?
[53:34.62]Let's see if I can see anything.
[53:37.68]Will he come up here now?
[53:38.40]Come up here.
[53:39.34]You'll jump up here now, won't you?
[53:40.96]Come on.
[53:42.92]Come on.
[53:43.18]This way.
[53:47.26]Come on, dog.
[53:49.16]You can do it.
[53:49.84]It's not that far.
[53:54.42]Hey!
[53:55.38]That was so loud.
[54:01.18]Alright, take a look guys.
[54:01.96]Did you think I was going to miss that cigarette fucking picnic basket?
[54:04.40]Don't think so.
[54:07.43]Alright, doggo.
[54:09.97]You know what to do.
[54:11.47]Blast for dinner.
[54:21.05]And this one's hot too.
[54:22.30]You heated this one up just like a stew.
[54:24.96]Let me pick this up.
[54:25.80]Are you just going to eat it out of the ground?
[54:30.36]Go for it.
[54:31.46]I won't stop you.
[54:34.53]Or are you not going to do it?
[54:36.95]You want to be hand-fed?
[54:37.91]Is that your problem?
[54:39.91]Okay.
[54:45.97]Oh, there we go.
[54:46.71]Alright, here you go.
[54:49.08]Here's your stew.
[54:49.92]Would you heat it up?
[54:52.44]Ready?
[54:53.60]Ready?
[54:53.88]Hey!
[54:54.42]Hey!
[54:59.04]Hey!
[55:01.26]You need to wait.
[55:02.17]You wait.
[55:04.99]He took it right out of my hands.
[55:08.61]You little shit.
[55:11.69]Now this is on the regular PS4, not PS4 Pro.
[55:18.51]Alright, what can we do in here?
[55:23.72]Let's go up here, maybe?
[55:25.30]Over here, buddy.
[55:27.32]I need to climb on top of you.
[55:32.50]The spray bottle.
[55:33.54]Oh, jeez.
[55:34.04]Gotta train my dog.
[55:35.33]I just got him!
[55:36.85]He's pretty much a puppy, guys.
[55:38.07]I just got him from the petrescue.org, whatever it was.
[55:42.17]Petfinder.com or something.
[55:46.44]Let me get on your head.
[55:47.24]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[55:49.20]No, no, no, no!
[55:49.64]Don't back up!
[55:52.82]Well, actually, just do what you're doing.
[55:54.74]Do what you're doing.
[55:58.80]Fuck.
[55:59.86]He wasn't close enough.
[56:00.58]Come here!
[56:01.52]You gotta get closer.
[56:02.31]You can't back up!
[56:05.23]Come here.
[56:06.43]You gotta get closer to this.
[56:08.67]Come on.
[56:11.07]Come on, Trico.
[56:12.61]Over here.
[56:13.11]There you go.
[56:14.27]Now stay there.
[56:19.32]Stop moving around.
[56:19.88]I need to climb on top of you.
[56:22.74]It's very important.
[56:25.65]There we go.
[56:31.75]You know, we talked about broken bones.
[56:34.69]He's dead again.
[56:35.30]Let's just keep going up.
[56:42.71]Silently judging me.
[56:43.62]What else is there?
[56:49.04]Over there.
[56:54.70]Extreme grip.
[56:55.66]Yeah, he's not gonna let go for anything, man.
[57:00.47]Easy now.
[57:02.49]Grab the chain.
[57:03.13]I'm gonna fuck this up.
[57:05.29]I'm going to mess this up bad.
[57:07.87]Well, here we go.
[57:09.09]I gotta line it up right.
[57:12.16]Oh, I see treats!
[57:12.72]Do you guys see the treat box?
[57:14.36]Gotta get that.
[57:15.68]We're going for 100% treat completion.
[57:20.18]Fucking please don't miss this.
[57:22.56]See, I told you I wasn't gonna miss it.
[57:28.61]Where am I going with this anyways?
[57:30.11]Oh boy.
[57:39.93]Going up high, high, high.
[57:41.55]There's an entryway there.
[57:45.57]I need to get that treat box.
[57:46.57]Can I jump from here, you think?
[57:47.68]What do you guys think?
[57:49.02]Running?
[57:49.32]No, I'm not going to make it.
[57:50.02]No way.
[57:52.06]If I go up a little bit higher, maybe.
[57:55.24]Is it worth the try?
[57:55.92]No, no, no, no.
[57:57.00]Look, look, look.
[57:57.46]No, no.
[58:01.68]Wait.
[58:02.34]Wait a second.
[58:02.84]You're not supposed to be up here right now.
[58:04.29]We need to get you the other treat box.
[58:07.53]Go back down.
[58:09.23]Hey, go down.
[58:12.47]Down.
[58:13.09]Come on.
[58:15.01]We need to get you that other treat box.
[58:16.45]I missed it.
[58:16.87]It's right there.
[58:18.86]I need to go right over here.
[58:20.02]Come on.
[58:22.48]Down.
[58:22.80]Come on down.
[58:24.20]Down.
[58:40.26]I got fucked up Oh shit I fucked up right now That wasn't a joke I just was trying to grab you
[59:04.12]I love how he just gets so... Oh, that's amazing.
[59:07.48]Alright, slow down.
[59:09.18]Stop moving around.
[59:09.78]We gotta get you that fucking treat basket.
[59:13.98]Alright, be careful.
[59:18.82]Oh, is it over here?
[59:26.34]Grab it.
[59:31.39]One more.
[59:35.57]And 100% treat basket completion rate.
[59:43.13]Where is he going now?
[59:44.23]Are you lying down?
[59:45.23]Did he roll over or something?
[59:47.57]Where the hell did he go?
[59:49.51]Hey.
[59:51.73]Hey, there you are.
[59:52.17]Look what I got.
[59:55.45]Come here.
[59:58.59]Can you catch it?
[59:59.97]Catch it.
[60:00.25]Oh, yeah.
[60:02.77]I love those.
[60:04.57]Alright, you ready?
[60:05.89]One, two, three.
[60:11.99]Yes!
[60:12.63]Nice catch.
[60:15.35]Any others?
[60:15.71]No.
[60:17.75]Alright, now we can go where we were going before.
[60:20.65]Just don't move around too much so I can't grab you.
[60:27.45]Go back to where you were.
[60:28.35]Jump up there now.
[60:29.03]You had to wait until I had to get all the way up.
[60:32.01]Alright, we're going to do that again.
[60:33.97]Maybe not.
[60:34.41]Come on.
[60:34.61]Put your face up a little bit further.
[60:35.71]Put your face up.
[60:38.13]Lean forward.
[60:40.37]Lean forward.
[60:40.85]Come on.
[60:41.39]I don't want to, like, poke you in the eyes.
[60:42.46]Come on.
[60:42.84]Put your face up.
[60:44.80]Put your nose up.
[60:47.24]Come on.
[60:48.76]Oh, what a good boy.
[60:50.32]That was perfect.
[60:51.30]Nice job, dog.
[60:57.14]It's poison.
[60:57.92]What?
[60:58.56]Hey.
[61:00.88]Hey, easy.
[61:02.78]Don't fuck around with that.
[61:04.86]Daddy's about to go jump and get it.
[61:06.12]It's not a toy.
[61:06.76]That's not a toy!
[61:09.61]Hey!
[61:11.41]Get out of the way!
[61:14.63]Daddy's doing an important mission.
[61:20.22]Okay, that was really, really cute.
[61:22.00]That was super unbelievably adorable.
[61:27.20]Make sure I didn't miss anything down there.
[61:28.90]There could be another crate basket.
[61:32.64]Hmm.
[61:33.18]Probably not.
[61:35.13]Who cares?
[61:39.77]Thank you for the thousand bits, dude.
[61:41.71]Large dog simulator is best game.
[61:43.51]The drac... The dracon!
[61:44.95]Thank you, draconqueens.
[61:48.22]I guess I can take a minute here to say thanks to... Because I've been getting subs and stuff, and I'm being a terrible streamer, so... We'll wait for the dog to get up here.
[61:55.86]Come on, you got up here before, you can do it again.
[61:58.82]Mr. Cables, thanks for the sub.
[62:00.48]The Draconicus... How do you say your name?
[62:04.22]Draconicus?
[62:06.18]Thanks, dude.
[62:08.52]For Verilic for 12 months.
[62:11.46]I'm gonna find you on Tinder and catfish you, so I can be with you forever.
[62:15.73]Well, Verilic, that's...
[62:19.68]Where is he going?
[62:20.24]You're filling up the hole.
[62:21.44]I can't see anything.
[62:23.13]Slow down.
[62:23.61]Hold on.
[62:27.09]Stay put.
[62:27.55]Stay.
[62:27.83]What's the stay command?
[62:29.19]I know R1 is stay.
[62:31.10]Stop moving.
[62:32.36]Be a good dog.
[62:36.47]Thank you, Dean Ziggs, for the eight months.
[62:37.79]But thank you, Mr. Bill, for three months as well.
[62:40.11]MegalomaniacalHaleed, thanks for 12 months.
[62:42.29]It's been a year already.
[62:44.11]Thanks for sticking around this whole time, man.
[62:46.71]Minuteman for two months.
[62:47.60]MeowNark.
[62:49.00]Thank you, Rancor25 for two months.
[62:51.58]NateMan1030.
[62:54.42]iGardener93 for three months.
[62:56.62]I bet it has giant fleas.
[62:57.84]It probably does.
[62:58.42]He's pushing me.
[62:59.20]He's getting sick of me standing here.
[63:02.61]He's like, hurry up and move.
[63:03.80]What is he doing?
[63:05.70]Oh, come here.
[63:06.95]Are you trying to make me fucking melt?
[63:11.21]Uh, thank you, Getal3.
[63:12.19]Uh, swiggity-biggity.
[63:15.33]The real, actual for real Jerma I caught up to there.
[63:18.51]And then, Draconicus again for a thousand bits.
[63:20.28]Thanks, dude.
[63:21.52]X-Tenant for 200.
[63:23.30]X-Tenant again for 500.
[63:24.12]He's gonna push me off the cliff.
[63:26.04]X-Tenant again for 500.
[63:27.78]Watching this doggo's movements and expressions is honestly just making me smile.
[63:30.62]It is.
[63:31.92]It's very adorable.
[63:34.07]Thank you, Todd, for the 500 bits.
[63:35.93]Again, yes, this is PS4 only.
[63:40.00]And a tenant again for 200 bits.
[63:41.48]Still waiting for someone to guess my number between 1 and 100.
[63:43.44]What is he doing?
[63:47.47]Has anybody ever stood still for this game?
[63:52.05]He's like playing with me.
[63:53.01]Uh, Chrisman, thanks for the 420 bits.
[63:59.04]I think I caught up there.
[63:59.92]Orthocone gave some bits, too.
[64:00.96]Thanks, Orthocone.
[64:01.56]And there's a bunch of other bits, too, but Cheeseburger just came in with 425.
[64:06.26]Thanks a lot, guys.
[64:07.83]And, of course, Sizzlebread and Penguinesque for the subs.
[64:11.17]Thank you guys a lot.
[64:11.85]Let's go.
[64:15.43]Alright, you ready?
[64:15.93]Let's keep moving, buddy.
[64:17.51]There's much more to see in this wonderful game.
[64:20.07]Okay, we got a Zap.
[64:26.25]Let's go in the cave.
[64:28.19]Cave.
[64:29.77]Ooh, look at that.
[64:30.51]There's another treat basket.
[64:38.80]There you go.
[64:39.28]Is there a way you can turn off the tooltips?
[64:43.32]I kind of, like, have figured out how to pick things up at this point.
[64:48.73]Give it to me.
[64:50.15]That's my treat.
[64:57.19]Alright, go ahead and get it.
[65:02.55]So I'm not entirely sure what the hell those things do.
[65:07.54]What do those do?
[65:10.24]It's obviously not health.
[65:11.12]We're not in any immediate danger right now.
[65:14.90]I'm not sure.
[65:21.98]Soggy barrel.
[65:24.28]Are we really up to 30 swears?
[65:26.50]Wow.
[65:27.26]I'm going to clean myself up a little bit, huh?
[65:33.82]Good gate.
[65:37.72]Jurassic Park forest.
[65:41.48]I can climb here, I think.
[65:44.72]Can I?
[65:44.98]Okay.
[65:59.61]Oh, wait a minute.
[66:01.43]Okay.
[66:03.08]Well, that's... That was easy enough.
[66:08.26]That's over 30 swears in an hour, right?
[66:11.60]That's one swear every two minutes, right?
[66:15.68]Wow.
[66:17.16]One swear every two minutes?
[66:19.88]Is that for real?
[66:21.52]Alright, I'm not swearing again.
[66:26.68]This is really cool.
[66:29.67]Here he comes.
[66:34.01]He's just perched out there.
[66:42.36]Cool.
[66:46.46]So, just keep going.
[66:48.20]Yes.
[66:57.48]I don't want to miss anything.
[66:58.46]I mean, I'm taking to the scenery, but... I don't want to miss anything.
[67:05.10]Holy shit.
[67:09.46]Gorgeous.
[67:10.24]Absolutely gorgeous.
[67:19.23]He's gonna crush me with his leg one of these days.
[67:21.23]I hope not.
[67:33.85]There he goes.
[67:34.41]He's just, like, grazing over there.
[67:35.78]This is gorgeous, but there's one problem.
[67:46.24]It is, like, 20 frames a second.
[67:49.74]But, apparently, if you have a PS4 Pro, that goes away completely.
[67:53.51]What did you find over there?
[67:58.83]Love, not leg.
[68:02.67]Well, boy...
[68:05.21]We made it out.
[68:06.97]What's next in our adventure?
[68:11.35]Holy shit, that's bright.
[68:15.73]Jump, no.
[68:16.67]I'm just looking around.
[68:17.61]I just want to see the scenery, man.
[68:21.56]We have a very cute game and a very cute dog.
[68:27.20]The bloom is so high.
[68:28.22]PS Pro sellout?
[68:29.24]I don't have a PS Pro.
[68:31.52]I have a regular shitty-ass PS4.
[68:36.47]Uh, what the hell is this?
[68:43.87]More gates.
[68:44.59]Okay.
[68:48.57]Maybe I did have to go all the way, because this is where we came in, right?
[68:53.92]So maybe we just have to go all the way around?
[68:56.66]Okay.
[68:58.80]What is that?
[69:08.02]Let's just go back to where I was.
[69:09.04]Excuse me, dog.
[69:13.93]Two swears in two seconds.
[69:17.15]I can't help it.
[69:18.55]It's just burned into my vocabulary to say a swear word every, like, three minutes.
[69:22.16]I wish there was something I could do, but can I go to, like, the doctor and, like, get prescribed anti-swear medication?
[69:29.77]Oh, yes, uh, Jeremy.
[69:30.79]Thank you for coming in.
[69:32.21]You have the most disgusting fucking party mouth I've ever seen.
[69:35.50]I used to, too.
[69:36.22]Until I started taking swear away.
[69:39.62]Changed my life.
[69:43.24]As you can tell, I still swear every now and then, but I can't.
[69:46.02]I just can't fucking help it.
[69:47.02]I know what it's like.
[69:48.14]I take it, too.
[69:48.81]Um... Whoa, easy.
[69:57.33]Can I go over there?
[70:00.75]I don't think so.
[70:01.45]Doesn't look like you can really do anything over there.
[70:03.87]Or does it?
[70:07.28]It's sticking out in a really odd place.
[70:08.72]Hmm.
[70:13.94]Okay.
[70:16.10]Don't fall!
[70:21.13]More jokes added to the counter.
[70:23.01]Alright, let me actually figure out what the hell I need to do here.
[70:27.11]What the heck I need to do.
[70:28.03]Let's say heck instead.
[70:30.31]Looks like I need to come this way.
[70:34.85]So... This framerate's killing me, though.
[70:38.46]Come over here.
[70:43.44]Jump!
[70:47.48]Jump!
[70:54.34]Can I get on his head and climb somewhere?
[70:58.85]Stay right there.
[70:59.33]I wanna look at something.
[71:01.65]Whoa, God!
[71:02.23]Okay, he's just going.
[71:07.51]He's just gonna go.
[71:08.33]Good thing I grabbed his leg.
[71:12.80]Okay, there is a kaleidoscope over here that we haven't seen yet.
[71:18.76]Put me down.
[71:23.80]What the hell does that mean?
[71:25.32]He's, like, scared of this thing.
[71:29.04]Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything back here.
[71:32.49]Ah, no!
[71:32.87]Damn it!
[71:33.41]Somebody broke one.
[71:34.91]Look.
[71:36.17]There would have been a treat basket here, but somebody smashed it.
[71:41.09]You freaking... ...blotheads.
[71:44.56]Alright, let's just go see what that does.
[71:45.70]Is this, like, a checkpoint or something?
[71:47.98]I have a 780.
[71:48.62]I do have a 780.
[71:49.68]It's not... I'm on a PlayStation 4.
[71:53.06]Should I stand on it?
[71:57.77]He does not like this.
[71:58.67]Should I zap it?
[72:02.37]Alright, if you don't like it that much, then let's zap the damn thing.
[72:11.19]Smash it!
[72:12.74]See?
[72:13.76]Now it's not scary anymore.
[72:14.88]You destroyed it.
[72:16.46]I hope I was supposed to do that.
[72:18.58]Because if not, then, you know, I might have just screwed something up.
[72:27.88]It has handles on it.
[72:28.70]Can I move it?
[72:31.80]I can't really grab it.
[72:35.46]Jump, jump, jump.
[72:36.84]Thank you, Penguin-esque, for the thousand bits.
[72:38.48]Here, buy some swear away.
[72:39.76]I guess we can't do anything with that.
[72:44.42]Thank you, Penguin.
[72:46.98]Alright, we've made it indoors.
[72:51.56]We can turn the bloom off.
[72:54.47]I can still see it.
[73:00.14]This looks a little more complicated.
[73:05.72]That was a key item for later in the game.
[73:07.77]You are fucked.
[73:10.91]Thanks, dragon.
[73:13.55]I hope that's not the case.
[73:14.63]Alright, well, you... I don't know where you're gonna go.
[73:16.93]But we need to continue.
[73:19.31]Slow down.
[73:22.41]What is wrong with you?
[73:25.52]Oh, wait a minute.
[73:26.08]This looks like... Okay, that's like a cage.
[73:29.40]That looks like a cage that they keep them in.
[73:31.62]And that's why he's pissed off at this place.
[73:34.66]You want to get rid of the cage?
[73:36.22]Here.
[73:36.98]I'll let you do whatever you... We're on, like, your time right now.
[73:39.51]You destroy that cage.
[73:44.13]It didn't work.
[73:44.63]It's okay.
[73:45.17]Don't worry.
[73:45.47]I'll take care of it.
[73:46.83]I'll get rid of the bad, mean cage.
[73:48.17]Wait, wait, wait.
[73:52.56]Come here, come here, come here.
[73:53.34]I got this.
[73:56.12]I honestly just tried to do a dodge roll like Dark Souls.
[74:03.64]I didn't miss a secret.
[74:04.40]I'm holding the secret right now.
[74:07.09]Did I just say keep?
[74:08.57]I hope I didn't.
[74:09.77]I probably did, though.
[74:11.91]Let's hope that's not the case.
[74:16.76]Here you go, dog.
[74:22.22]And then I gotta go up to the right, and I'm assuming I gotta do a lot of stuff.
[74:41.01]Why is he so mad?
[74:46.58]Okay, I just hit R1 and pressed a different button and he freaked out.
[75:03.43]Very good.
[75:04.83]Thanks for the 20 bucks, dude.
[75:05.81]My stuff has been a 12-month resub for like three months in a row.
[75:09.75]I think Twitch is broken.
[75:14.41]Well, regardless, you'll be on 12 months forever, apparently.
[75:20.99]But thanks for the 20 bucks, dude.
[75:22.47]Okay, I see another tree basket over there.
[75:25.55]No, don't shoot it.
[75:26.23]Put this thing away.
[75:27.55]I don't want any accidental zaps.
[75:32.57]Keep going.
[75:37.65]Here comes the bloom.
[75:40.37]Hey, somebody call Orlando.
[75:42.17]We've got some of his bloom.
[75:51.76]I got a little too excited on that one.
[75:54.66]This is a little bit.
[75:59.43]Mmm.
[76:08.07]Can you do anything over here?
[76:09.09]You can scream.
[76:16.12]Oh, hold on.
[76:17.46]You're looking at something.
[76:19.76]Stay right there.
[76:24.04]I want a formal apology.
[76:25.49]I'm sorry.
[76:27.31]I'm formally going to apologize for that joke.
[76:29.23]It was just... It was terrible.
[76:31.75]I knew it was, but I did it anyways.
[76:34.17]Alright, can I jump to something from here when he pushes me up?
[76:37.03]Is there a ledge I can grab?
[76:38.19]It looks like I can.
[76:38.98]Right there.
[76:40.40]Alright, come on.
[76:41.54]Can you do anything here?
[76:43.56]That looks very grabbable from where I am, but maybe I'm crazy.
[76:47.06]Oh!
[76:58.12]I don't think so.
[76:59.52]Not from where I'm standing.
[77:00.44]Uh... Oh, I just, like, stepped on his head.
[77:12.55]Yeah, I'm gonna come back here later.
[77:18.59]I feel like I can't do this yet.
[77:19.59]Unless I'm missing something.
[77:25.02]I can't, like, grab and hold onto this, can I?
[77:26.76]And just, like, shimmy up like a bear.
[77:28.14]I'm gonna try a bear shimmy.
[77:32.92]Nope.
[77:33.36]Good thing he caught me with his face.
[77:36.50]Go over there.
[77:37.08]No.
[77:43.14]It looks grabbable, but maybe he needs to be over this way.
[77:45.50]Come over this way, dog.
[77:47.02]Can I get that side?
[77:48.05]I probably can get that side.
[77:48.99]Come here.
[77:56.80]Try this wall.
[77:58.02]Over here!
[78:00.56]Move your body over here, I wanna see if I can grab this ledge instead.
[78:10.15]Hey, you!
[78:11.55]Over here!
[78:15.15]You're not cooperating, dog!
[78:16.45]Come on!
[78:16.71]Let's see if I can get him out of the tunnel first.
[78:25.19]Alright, I'll come back over here.
[78:26.07]I just want to see if I can grab that ledge.
[78:27.47]That's all I care about.
[78:28.35]Right here.
[78:34.83]Alright, stay right there.
[78:36.35]That's exactly what I wanted you to do.
[78:38.67]Except I don't want to wrap around his leg.
[78:45.56]Okay, well that was not what I wanted.
[78:48.70]Come on, dog.
[78:57.03]So from here, can I get that ledge?
[79:02.07]I think I can.
[79:05.07]I don't think so.
[79:06.59]No, maybe not.
[79:07.31]Maybe I'm not supposed to even be down here.
[79:09.30]Let me try that one more time.
[79:10.52]I didn't feel like I had a good grab on that one.
[79:13.86]It looks like I can get that, though.
[79:19.98]One more attempt.
[79:23.18]Oh, fuck.
[79:24.10]His neck is caught in the door.
[79:29.36]Alright, well, fuck it.
[79:30.00]We're going to go back there later.
[79:30.92]Just want to make sure I don't miss anything back here.
[79:34.64]Broken legs.
[79:35.38]What about here?
[79:44.71]Can you get me up there, dog?
[79:47.93]I see something up there.
[79:48.79]Over here.
[79:54.10]I can get in there.
[79:55.22]Come here, dog.
[80:02.48]Stop headbutting him.
[80:03.42]I'm trying not to.
[80:04.06]I'm trying to be gentle.
[80:06.90]Sometimes he's a dumb doggo and I need to say, hey, come here.
[80:17.03]Oh, that's so bright.
[80:18.43]Oh, that's so bright.
[80:19.43]Whoa!
[80:25.86]Okay, it told me to jump.
[80:26.92]Alright, we're good.
[80:28.42]We're fine.
[80:28.70]We're fine.
[80:29.38]We're okay.
[80:29.64]Okay.
[80:34.02]That was terrifying.
[80:37.80]No, I wanna hang, because I gotta go that way.
[80:40.93]Wait, let me just check over here.
[80:43.91]I wish the camera would move over there.
[80:45.11]This is the very end, right?
[80:48.53]Nothing over here.
[80:49.21]Alright, let's go.
[80:55.21]Can I make the jump?
[80:56.07]Can I make the jump?
[80:59.45]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[81:02.75]Don't be an idiot!
[81:07.15]I gotta calm the fuck down here.
[81:09.23]Calm down.
[81:10.93]Seriously.
[81:12.29]It's not that hard.
[81:15.69]There we are.
[81:19.18]Love me some directional jumping.
[81:21.04]Me too.
[81:21.82]Should I check what's... No.
[81:25.38]Fuck it.
[81:25.90]Fuck the secret.
[81:30.57]I wanna do directional jumping.
[81:37.86]I am so going to fuck this up.
[81:39.84]Guys, get your fuck-up meter ready.
[81:41.78]It's going to happen here very shortly.
[81:48.78]Okay.
[81:49.36]Directional jump.
[81:56.69]I did it.
[82:02.59]Slow it down.
[82:03.43]I don't want to break all my bones right now.
[82:08.75]I should be able just to drop, right?
[82:11.45]I hope so!
[82:11.99]Yeah, we're good.
[82:15.50]Alright, can he come over here now?
[82:18.04]Anywhere for you to go?
[82:21.34]No?
[82:22.52]He thinks I'm still in there.
[82:23.42]I'm not in there!
[82:24.10]Oh, hello, look.
[82:34.54]Stream the Uncharted collection?
[82:39.62]I've never played any of the Uncharted games.
[82:41.66]Not even the first one.
[82:42.79]Kind of a... Kind of weird that I never have, considering that I would probably like them a lot.
[82:50.19]Here you go, dog.
[82:51.06]I got a treat.
[82:54.48]Let me drink the coffee that I just spit back into this.
[82:58.68]Oh, wow.
[82:59.70]That's pretty good.
[83:05.99]Holy shit, I'm playing it?
[83:07.03]Yeah, I was planning on playing it for a while.
[83:11.69]And so far, it's been a very enjoyable experience.
[83:15.65]Hey!
[83:16.07]Give me a second to give it to you!
[83:18.31]Alright, how do I say that was, like, bad?
[83:21.52]Bad dog!
[83:23.12]Bad dog!
[83:24.90]Sit down!
[83:25.96]Sit!
[83:27.22]Sit down!
[83:31.70]See, he knows.
[83:33.14]Look at that guilty face.
[83:36.07]Okay, yes, I still love you.
[83:38.13]Come here.
[83:39.15]Yeah, see?
[83:39.67]Because you can't rip treats out of Daddy's hand.
[83:46.38]You can't do that.
[83:47.54]You're going to get hurt.
[83:48.24]You're going to hurt me.
[83:49.04]Alright, let's go.
[83:55.74]Through here.
[83:56.72]Through here, you big goofball.
[84:00.30]You're a little too close.
[84:01.10]I don't want you to get electro-zapped.
[84:05.32]Whoa.
[84:08.12]Such a bad spot.
[84:11.28]Stay over there.
[84:12.32]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[84:13.78]Come over there.
[84:14.40]Where is he going?
[84:15.82]Hey.
[84:17.72]Hey.
[84:22.45]What?
[84:23.03]You know, you're mad at me.
[84:24.99]I can't come over there.
[84:25.85]You don't like me anymore.
[84:26.69]You don't love me.
[84:30.35]Break that down.
[84:34.19]Come on.
[84:38.91]Come on.
[84:42.25]Look.
[84:43.73]I know.
[84:44.15]I know.
[84:44.49]I know.
[84:44.71]It's hard being this big.
[84:45.95]I get it.
[84:46.41]But please break this door down.
[84:52.40]It must be real hard to be as huge as you are.
[84:54.48]So please destroy that door.
[84:58.26]Okay.
[84:59.10]Come here.
[84:59.50]I need to say that was a good boy.
[85:04.65]Very good job.
[85:05.53]Okay.
[85:07.55]Let's keep moving.
[85:13.43]There's the cage that he doesn't like.
[85:15.97]Anything in here I can grab onto.
[85:17.49]Remember, in The Last Guardian, always look in the sky.
[85:23.23]Because there's things you can always grab onto.
[85:26.21]Wait, no, he's focused though.
[85:35.68]He does not look very happy.
[85:49.00]This is definitely a cage.
[85:53.04]Come here, come here, it's okay.
[85:57.12]Why don't I calm him down?
[85:59.74]Come here, I'm gonna jump on his head.
[86:07.39]Scratch him behind the ears.
[86:09.87]It's okay, I'm here.
[86:13.61]I'm right here.
[86:15.12]See?
[86:15.46]It's me!
[86:20.29]Your best friend!
[86:23.63]I think he's too focused on this, but let's just get down there.
[86:40.58]Oh, what is this?
[86:43.90]Okay.
[86:45.74]That looks like some type of control device or something.
[86:51.84]What is this?
[86:52.40]Is this a door?
[86:53.44]Can I get him to shock that?
[86:54.94]Or maybe he should just zap this.
[86:57.62]Will he listen to me from up there?
[87:03.73]No.
[87:04.01]I gotta keep moving.
[87:04.89]I have to disable this cage or something somehow.
[87:10.76]I know.
[87:11.70]I know.
[87:12.86]I'm gonna take care of it.
[87:22.51]Or am I going to take care of it?
[87:25.09]It's okay.
[87:25.57]Daddy won't take care of this.
[87:26.71]Listen to Daddy.
[87:31.06]Okay, what's the point of me doing this?
[87:41.34]Oh, I see the point.
[87:45.25]I can see there's probably a point over there.
[87:53.97]Can I go this whole way alone?
[87:57.69]It's okay.
[87:58.24]Just listen to daddy.
[87:59.52]Listen to daddy.
[88:00.18]I gotta stop doing that.
[88:01.66]Get on!
[88:02.30]Get on there!
[88:06.88]You're telling me you can't do that?
[88:07.82]Really?
[88:08.67]What's wrong with you?
[88:16.95]Listen to me!
[88:17.47]Listen to daddy!
[88:22.50]Is there like a switch?
[88:24.14]What the fuck is going on?
[88:25.04]Okay, that was weird.
[88:26.44]Apparently there was a cutscene.
[88:41.69]No!
[88:45.37]No, I gotta shut that thing off.
[88:50.53]How do I turn it off?
[88:52.71]Ah!
[88:53.11]Ah!
[88:53.49]Ah!
[88:55.43]What?
[88:55.63]Is he eating me?
[88:57.52]What?
[89:03.24]What the fuck?
[89:10.75]What the fuck?
[89:53.45]The portal's a yargle.
[89:56.83]I got the bad ending.
[89:58.85]No, I gotta press all the buttons!
[90:02.88]Maybe he didn't need me.
[90:03.60]Maybe he just, like, put me in his esophagus and then threw me up when we got safe.
[90:10.68]Come on, that's definitely what happened, right?
[90:15.52]Oh.
[90:16.38]Come on, dog.
[90:22.45]He didn't eat me after all.
[90:28.83]He just was scared and he was trying to keep me safe.
[90:30.75]I don't want to wake him up.
[90:33.53]Aww.
[90:55.26]Well.
[90:57.14]Dog.
[91:00.20]Is there anything I can do for him?
[91:05.70]Should I wake him up?
[91:11.39]I guess not.
[91:14.75]Well.
[91:20.41]I guess I'm going to keep going this way.
[91:21.91]Maybe he'll wake up when I get down here.
[91:27.05]Yeah, he's alive.
[91:34.63]Oh, I can see your tail is in such a great spot for me to climb it.
[91:41.85]That's clever.
[91:43.25]Clever.
[91:54.92]Clever.
[91:58.09]Okay.
[92:00.81]What does that do for me?
[92:01.93]I guess I can go this way.
[92:04.33]But is there anything else I can do?
[92:05.61]I don't think so.
[92:07.42]I'm going to go in the tiny hallway.
[92:14.48]Drago!
[92:15.84]Drago!
[92:17.92]Getting flashbacks of Shadow of the Colossus.
[92:20.30]Agro!
[92:21.86]Agro!
[92:24.99]I swear to God, if a mutant jumps in front of me right now, I'm gonna be scared.
[92:28.76]Of course I would.
[92:29.38]Why wouldn't I be scared?
[92:35.44]Hm, cutscene.
[92:41.88]What a graceful jump.
[92:46.18]Oh, look at the frog people.
[92:53.56]Uh-oh.
[92:59.78]We have more little mini-guardians.
[93:10.87]Let me guess.
[93:12.47]These things are gonna come alive.
[93:14.21]And that's where I get my fucking axe.
[93:16.93]That's where I get my spear.
[93:21.14]And I can do like... And that same exact voice line plays every time I swing the sword.
[93:30.45]I'm gonna go down here.
[93:42.92]Nope.
[93:43.76]Come on!
[93:44.82]Where do I go?
[93:45.58]I'm playing a first person horror game right now.
[93:52.56]Fuck.
[93:53.04]Okay, let's check over here because I really don't want to go all the way down there for no reason.
[93:59.15]Okay, so we have to go down that way.
[94:01.95]We have to go down that way.
[94:03.69]Yep, that.
[94:06.67]It's going to happen.
[94:08.39]And then you hold down triangle to do a big charge attack and he goes...
[94:24.35]And then when you get hit, you go... I've played these games before.
[94:36.33]Let's climb the spinal column.
[94:46.77]Hmm.
[94:49.31]Ooh.
[94:50.95]I can press a button.
[95:07.73]Is this too fucking loud?
[95:09.07]I'm looking over at my OBS and it looks real loud.
[95:12.59]It's not like crazy unbearably loud for you guys.
[95:15.53]Because I can turn it down in the game options.
[95:21.13]Should I go up?
[95:21.91]I can get up there, can't I?
[95:27.00]Well, that's where, like, the fucking Snattacats are.
[95:33.02]There's no other option, I don't think.
[95:34.94]It's fine, it's not that loud.
[95:35.76]Okay.
[95:35.86]Alright, here we go, guys.
[95:38.38]Time to walk down and have them all activate.
[95:40.60]And it's gonna start playing... Here it comes!
[95:42.70]Oh, shit!
[95:43.36]It really is doing that.
[95:44.40]Oh, god!
[95:55.81]This isn't the right way.
[95:57.61]Oh, God!
[96:05.82]Get off me!
[96:06.90]Get off me!
[96:10.22]Get off me!
[96:14.06]Run!
[96:14.92]No, run!
[96:16.90]Run!
[96:18.26]It drained my soul!
[96:24.03]Trico, get up.
[96:25.59]Trico, wake up.
[96:26.51]Help me.
[96:28.43]Alright.
[96:29.95]I did a somersault on him.
[96:32.86]Trico.
[96:34.40]Trico.
[96:35.98]Now would be a good time to be awake.
[96:40.28]Trico.
[96:42.11]Help me.
[96:44.19]Help me, please.
[96:48.23]Come on.
[96:51.11]There he goes.
[96:51.79]This is where we zap the shit out of him.
[96:57.35]Jesus.
[96:59.33]Oh, now they're like, oh shit.
[97:07.77]Get the other guys too.
[97:09.11]But be careful, I'm on you.
[97:10.63]I'm currently riding you.
[97:12.97]Jesus.
[97:16.84]Oh, he's kicking ass right now.
[97:18.56]Jesus.
[97:23.78]I'm just barely hanging on.
[97:26.50]Oh, it's okay.
[97:27.26]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[97:27.80]Calm him down.
[97:28.34]Where are the treats?
[97:30.12]Come on.
[97:30.62]You always have to carry some kibble with you.
[97:33.69]Hey, hey, hey.
[97:48.99]Calm down! Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!
[97:51.45]We're really gonna be fine.
[97:53.65]We've only killed like 4 people.
[98:02.87]Like up on his head?
[98:05.27]There we go.
[98:08.00]Everything's gonna be fine.
[98:11.08]There you go.
[98:12.44]We just got rid of a bunch of evil, evil minions.
[98:18.10]Okay.
[98:18.46]Well, that's... I'm dead.
[98:23.52]Alright.
[98:23.78]Good boy!
[98:24.50]No, wait.
[98:25.90]Come over here.
[98:26.22]I want to check this, too.
[98:26.88]Come here.
[98:31.90]Scratch him behind the ears.
[98:32.81]That's what he likes the most.
[98:33.81]Wait.
[98:38.01]No, no, no.
[98:40.79]I want to get back on him.
[98:41.55]I want to jump on the other side.
[98:45.69]Come on.
[98:45.99]Stop being so finicky.
[98:50.29]Are we really counting all the jokes and swears?
[98:53.71]I'm going to look like such a loser at the end of this.
[98:59.57]I want to get to the other side and just see what's on there.
[99:02.92]I didn't have a chance to.
[99:04.20]Don't move that much.
[99:05.44]Not that much.
[99:07.90]There's a ladder right there.
[99:08.96]Go on.
[99:09.12]I want to see what that is.
[99:09.76]Move your head over here.
[99:24.13]He moves too much.
[99:26.03]Oh, it's alright.
[99:28.51]He's going to fight.
[99:29.07]We have to watch him kill him again.
[99:33.85]I'll just stand here.
[99:39.63]That's cooler even on this view.
[99:42.87]What is he doing?
[99:43.50]Get him!
[99:49.62]He's doing a little rabbit jump.
[99:52.50]Get him with a rabbit jump.
[100:00.49]Alright, calm down.
[100:01.25]I'm going to pet him on the tail.
[100:03.51]Slow down, slow down.
[100:11.19]Didn't happen that way.
[100:11.97]No, it didn't.
[100:12.49]That's only the second death.
[100:13.46]Come on.
[100:14.62]Not a big deal.
[100:16.26]Calm down.
[100:19.90]Calm down.
[100:20.68]Let's see.
[100:22.50]How long do I have to pet you for before you start to not freak out anymore?
[100:27.56]There you go.
[100:31.94]The jump is adorable.
[100:32.94]Yeah, they really did capture a animal.
[100:37.28]You can tell how much time went into making Trico like an actual animal.
[100:40.23]That's really good.
[100:42.03]Alright, don't fuck this up this time.
[100:44.05]Okay.
[100:45.37]There we go.
[100:52.11]What is, like, down here?
[100:56.21]Descend, please.
[100:57.09]Is there anything even here?
[101:02.36]Why does this exist?
[101:06.64]It just exists for no reason, huh?
[101:08.64]Okay.
[101:13.02]Why does this exist?
[101:13.76]I spent this time to do this and there's no reason to do it.
[101:17.80]Maybe from the effect... Ah, whatever.
[101:19.34]Screw it.
[101:19.71]Let's just go.
[101:32.08]Secret.
[101:33.38]Safe spot.
[101:33.88]Yeah, maybe that's what it is.
[101:36.78]Trico!
[101:39.21]Push the button?
[101:41.87]Secret, secret.
[101:42.51]What do you mean?
[101:43.15]What are you talking about?
[101:48.25]Uh, Trico, I have something for you to destroy.
[101:51.25]Please.
[101:53.75]Can you not get... Wait, can you not get down here?
[101:56.98]Where's my shield?
[102:00.20]What happened to my shield?
[102:05.76]Does that concern anybody else that I don't have the shield anymore?
[102:08.12]Where did it go?
[102:08.56]Uh-oh.
[102:14.61]I can't say I'm too happy about that.
[102:19.73]Would they grab me?
[102:20.97]Do they take the shield?
[102:30.92]I have no idea.
[102:34.09]Did the game tell me or what happened to it?
[102:38.63]Oh, okay.
[102:43.95]Let's see what's over this way.
[102:48.11]A little dark.
[102:57.65]Too dark this way.
[103:04.25]Other side?
[103:07.81]Maybe?
[103:15.12]Is there a button that I'm missing?
[103:16.18]It's so dark, I can't really even tell.
[103:17.64]Can I get up even higher?
[103:21.80]No.
[103:21.86]Is there a switch over here that I'm not seeing because it's too dark?
[103:31.22]No, what the hell?
[103:32.16]Oh, right up here.
[103:33.18]Okay.
[103:34.22]Come back over here, dog.
[103:35.22]I need you.
[103:44.50]I can't make this jump without him.
[103:46.06]I gotta get the chain.
[103:48.29]Come here, dog.
[103:51.67]I guess I can make that jump.
[104:01.66]Yeah, we need a little bit more bloom.
[104:07.46]Easy.
[104:07.88]It's not about being the hare, it's about being the tortoise.
[104:11.94]You want to actually win the race.
[104:22.81]Can't get in.
[104:26.83]Make sure I don't miss anything.
[104:28.75]Turn your body, and that looks pretty lined up.
[104:33.30]Oh!
[104:35.02]Okay.
[104:35.44]That's... That pulled it down.
[104:39.98]Ooh!
[104:44.27]Keep going.
[104:46.41]You're all brawn, aren't you?
[104:48.97]What?
[104:58.28]Here comes the bloom!
[104:59.14]Here comes the bloom!
[105:01.42]Ah!
[105:02.42]The sun!
[105:05.65]Jesus!
[105:07.27]Everything is bright white!
[105:12.13]I can't feel my eyes!
[105:19.00]Okay, what about back this way?
[105:20.86]Alright, I have a second.
[105:23.88]I want to say thank you to the people that subbed.
[105:26.90]Copyright TM for nine months, but I'm for six months.
[105:30.46]You know he's a cat bird, not a dog bird.
[105:32.26]Well, I saw a bird cage.
[105:33.88]That looked like a bird cage.
[105:34.78]That didn't look like a cat cage.
[105:37.50]But thanks for nine months, dude.
[105:39.36]Thank you guys.
[105:40.34]Radio video for ten months.
[105:42.54]Is this kid going to be in Jermania?
[105:43.84]Yeah.
[105:46.32]Probably not.
[105:47.92]Arch Lux for two months.
[105:48.86]Thanks a lot.
[105:49.94]Pizza Lemon Jaw.
[105:51.79]Hey, it's daft for three months.
[105:54.13]Shadow of the Colossus looks a lot different than I remember.
[105:57.27]It does.
[105:58.85]It's because it's a different game.
[106:01.39]Red Gear Pro.
[106:01.95]Thanks for two months.
[106:03.19]Palm Putt for three months.
[106:05.46]That's a big old puppy.
[106:07.86]Sizzlebread23.
[106:08.94]And that's all the subs.
[106:10.20]Thanks for the sub.
[106:10.84]And we got one more.
[106:11.56]Quara for two months.
[106:12.64]Thanks a lot, dude.
[106:13.36]And we also had...
[106:16.56]Oh, some bits here.
[106:19.80]Verilick obviously gave 2000.
[106:20.82]Thanks a lot, Verilick.
[106:22.48]20 bucks.
[106:24.00]Darren J had 200 bits.
[106:25.36]If you're going to break the joke rule, please at least make it a good joke.
[106:32.88]Thank you, though.
[106:34.56]And somebody was telling me this is from Dr. Pepper Relations.
[106:39.12]You want to sponsor me?
[106:40.41]You want to sponsor me, Dr. Pepper?
[106:44.19]Fuck yourself.
[106:47.90]No, no, I was just kidding.
[106:48.91]No, no, no.
[106:49.27]I don't really mean that.
[106:52.53]I don't mean that at all.
[106:54.63]I think I have to do something with this cage.
[106:59.85]There you are.
[107:04.53]Can you do anything with that?
[107:05.45]Or do I have to knock it down somehow?
[107:06.85]I don't think I can do anything about this.
[107:09.40]Maybe I can.
[107:10.66]Can you jump from there?
[107:13.58]You probably can jump from there.
[107:14.64]Is that too high for you?
[107:19.21]Does it look like it's too high?
[107:21.59]Hey!
[107:25.79]Come on, come on, come on.
[107:27.09]That actually scared the shit out of me.
[107:29.25]Oh, he's so big and clunky.
[107:30.95]I love him.
[107:34.43]Now he's in a sprint.
[107:35.13]That's the first time we've seen him run.
[107:39.17]He needs a big backyard.
[107:40.29]You know, down there we've been like in an apartment.
[107:43.60]He's not an apartment dog.
[107:44.70]He is a backyard, full-fenced-in yard dog.
[107:50.39]He's just kind of looking around.
[107:51.25]Where you going, man?
[107:57.52]He really just wants to sprint around.
[108:00.72]He wants a little yard.
[108:01.84]Alright, what about over here?
[108:03.40]I see there's something I can jump up and climb around up there.
[108:08.60]Looks like.
[108:10.10]I think.
[108:12.62]Where are you?
[108:18.12]Ah, he's taking in the sunlight.
[108:23.47]What are you looking at?
[108:26.95]Are you going to go up there?
[108:28.59]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[108:31.59]Let me get you first.
[108:32.91]If you're going to jump, then wait for me.
[108:38.32]What is he looking at over there?
[108:41.92]Is he... Are you going to jump?
[108:44.74]I think he's going to jump.
[108:46.39]I think he's just going wherever he wants to go.
[108:51.35]Alright, we're going this way.
[108:58.33]Anywhere else you'd like to go?
[108:59.31]I think that's... That's it.
[109:05.62]Let me just go up there.
[109:07.22]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[109:08.66]Hey!
[109:11.44]What is in here?
[109:13.04]Hey!
[109:15.76]You're like a mouse trying to go through an outlet.
[109:18.60]It's not gonna work.
[109:21.60]What is he trying to do?
[109:23.97]Oh, he smells like the pie.
[109:28.09]Okay, so this is like aroma.
[109:34.14]He's like attracted to the smell.
[109:35.54]Am I going to have to turn the smell off?
[109:39.64]I'm going to move out of the way.
[109:48.98]I guess I've just pushed this because it's attracting him.
[109:55.70]He wants to come to a different hole then?
[110:02.84]He's going to come in the other hole.
[110:05.54]He's going to come in this hole.
[110:10.81]Okay, by the way, yeah, yeah, I know.
[110:12.49]I said it.
[110:13.01]Yeah, I did.
[110:15.19]Yeah, I said it.
[110:16.09]Okay.
[110:17.20]Get your laughs out.
[110:18.60]Get it out.
[110:18.94]I hope you guys are laughing.
[110:25.13]I'm not sure what this is for, though.
[110:30.11]I guess I can climb this thing?
[110:34.19]I know I'm going to have to get on his head or something and jump from somewhere.
[110:38.68]Let's see what happens.
[110:41.80]Come here.
[110:42.22]Hold on.
[110:54.34]Good job connecting the dots.
[110:55.64]Okay, I don't know how to do that.
[111:03.87]I know I gotta climb up here, but what's the best way to do that?
[111:09.09]I can't really get on top of that.
[111:11.35]Try the middle hole.
[111:22.44]Come on, pull it.
[111:23.22]He's not going to crush me.
[111:25.78]Just take a look.
[111:27.30]You obviously have to put him in the right spot.
[111:29.42]Oh, don't move, dog.
[111:58.20]jump up from here.
[111:59.60]I can get inside.
[112:00.80]There's a place to jump inside, but not from here.
[112:14.15]Pull it back.
[112:15.61]Be strong.
[112:27.07]Now that he's outside, can I get up there?
[112:31.41]There we go.
[112:31.93]Okay.
[112:33.71]Go in there.
[112:35.49]Go in that one.
[112:37.81]Go in the middle one.
[112:39.27]I thought you loved this shit.
[112:42.21]I need to jump up there.
[112:43.29]Go to the middle one, not this one.
[112:45.69]Oh, you fucking dummy.
[112:48.87]Did it move all the way back to here?
[112:53.10]Why did it move all the way back here?
[112:58.14]I need to use his body to climb up.
[113:01.08]It moves too much.
[113:01.90]I have to, like, stop it.
[113:04.98]Okay, pull it back right here.
[113:07.98]This thing's just too heavy.
[113:12.33]Apparently I moved it too much.
[113:16.95]Stop right there.
[113:18.31]Right here.
[113:20.23]You gonna stop?
[113:23.02]Coming in this one?
[113:23.66]Alright, good.
[113:28.87]Get in there.
[113:38.58]There we go.
[113:43.98]This is where I can put a lid on the pot.
[113:47.38]Now I can climb down.
[113:50.23]Is there anything else I can do?
[113:51.63]No, climb into the fucking...
[113:55.40]Hey, guys.
[113:57.20]Climated... Junk weed.
[114:01.64]Right?
[114:02.90]Get in there.
[114:08.03]Oh, God.
[114:08.49]I fell.
[114:08.77]It's okay.
[114:10.61]There we are.
[114:12.92]Easy.
[114:14.94]Shut the pot.
[114:16.68]Close it.
[114:25.64]Alright, good.
[114:30.40]I ran my face into it a couple times.
[114:33.37]Now he's pissed off.
[114:34.07]He's mad that I closed it.
[114:35.33]Alright, now I can climb.
[114:41.23]Maybe he'll jump now.
[114:42.21]Oh, no.
[114:42.45]This is right here.
[114:45.47]Can I get this from here?
[114:46.37]I don't think I can reach that from here.
[114:49.18]Shit.
[114:50.86]Shit.
[114:54.81]Well, I'll just go back outside.
[114:55.89]Let's make sure I don't miss anything.
[115:00.52]No.
[115:00.98]Alright.
[115:01.26]Now is it going to be cool?
[115:02.44]Alright.
[115:08.76]You want to go somewhere?
[115:11.70]Do you smell any other smells that are going to attract you?
[115:14.46]No?
[115:16.22]Where are you going to go?
[115:23.84]You're gonna go that way?
[115:25.70]Well, stay.
[115:26.16]Hold on.
[115:27.82]There's another spot to go.
[115:29.34]He might be going to the bathroom.
[115:31.06]Dude, I hope they have him do huge dumps.
[115:33.88]That would make this game a 10 out of 10.
[115:37.35]No, he's gonna take a little bath.
[115:40.89]Oh, look at you.
[115:41.73]Oh, he's rolling in the water.
[115:47.13]That is so cool.
[115:49.85]He needed to do that, too.
[115:50.75]He had, like, a big wound on his back and his leg.
[115:56.02]Alright, you keep having fun.
[115:58.76]I'm gonna go explore a little bit more.
[116:01.24]Maybe I can find you a treat.
[116:10.14]Don't go that fast.
[116:17.97]That's a drop.
[116:22.31]Hmm.
[116:26.86]Seems odd that this would just stop right here.
[116:28.56]Unless I missed something on the other side.
[116:31.47]Place to go?
[116:32.17]Huh.
[116:40.39]Can we come over here?
[116:45.19]Seems odd that they would just... This has to be here for a reason, right?
[116:48.07]What if I just drop down?
[116:49.05]Can I drop down?
[116:49.69]It looks like there's no grip points after this.
[116:58.54]Oh, no, here he comes.
[116:59.78]Right?
[117:01.79]Hmm, I guess not.
[117:10.73]Well, okay.
[117:13.18]I guess there's nothing I can do right there.
[117:14.80]I think I need him to be over here for something.
[117:24.97]Nothing down there.
[117:26.59]Uh, not really.
[117:33.05]Wait, what?
[117:35.15]Jump, jump.
[117:36.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, there's moss down there.
[117:41.00]Can I climb this moss?
[117:43.00]What about the moss?
[117:53.62]Not sure it does anything for me, so it just puts me in a weird spot.
[117:55.99]There he comes, okay.
[117:56.91]Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[118:01.25]Alright, no, no, no, you come back down here.
[118:02.55]Come back here, I need to come on.
[118:04.47]Whoa, don't fall down.
[118:08.80]Back down.
[118:09.74]Yeah, that's what you gotta do.
[118:12.84]Alright, now do what you just did again.
[118:14.68]But only this time have me on top of you.
[118:18.16]Eat that moss for free stamina.
[118:19.92]Hahaha.
[118:22.99]Alright, do it again.
[118:23.77]Go for it.
[118:25.85]Go on, boy.
[118:29.25]Jump to your heart's content.
[118:34.65]Go for it.
[118:37.48]Go on.
[118:39.42]Go on, you.
[118:42.86]Go.
[118:45.70]Does that mean go?
[118:47.04]I think that might mean go.
[118:55.42]Go!
[118:56.90]Go!
[118:58.80]Do what you just did!
[119:05.68]Oh well, okay.
[119:19.67]Maybe he'll actually do something over here now?
[119:25.93]Come on!
[119:26.57]Okay, there we go.
[119:29.92]Now what are you gonna do from here?
[119:32.72]Is there another place for you to jump?
[119:33.62]Can you grab me or something?
[119:38.88]Maybe he'll find a way to jump?
[119:43.85]No, not really.
[119:46.45]What's the point of you being over there?
[119:47.55]Huh?
[119:55.67]No, he's looking for me, I guess.
[119:58.57]Although, let's see the ledge right next to him.
[120:00.91]I think I just need to wait for him to jump and then get on his tail.
[120:06.15]Maybe I can get his tail right now.
[120:10.00]Looks like I can get his tail right now.
[120:11.46]I'm going to go with the moth and get the tail.
[120:25.22]Alright, where are we going now?
[120:26.94]Take me.
[120:29.59]Oh, right over there.
[120:33.23]Thank you for the ride.
[120:34.37]Appreciate it, dog.
[120:36.91]Up, up, up, up, up.
[120:46.57]Thanks, you just accidentally killed me, dog.
[120:51.89]Looks like a dead end.
[120:54.69]But it ain't.
[121:01.30]Bird dog monster?
[121:02.30]Yeah, it's like a bird cat thing.
[121:05.26]It's a combination of all the animals in the rainforest.
[121:13.10]Are you done?
[121:13.48]Are you done or are we still going?
[121:15.26]I think we're still going.
[121:17.36]Oh, that's a wild ride.
[121:19.74]Okay.
[121:22.52]You still going?
[121:25.95]Oh, this is a lot of stuff out here.
[121:29.47]Where to?
[121:29.87]Okay.
[121:35.15]Can I get off the ride?
[121:36.13]Alright, I'm getting off the ride.
[121:38.85]I'm gonna go this way.
[121:45.81]Well, I didn't mean to fall all the way down.
[121:49.64]But, let me see.
[121:56.28]Shit.
[122:00.20]Fuck, I had to grab that, didn't I?
[122:12.30]I'm just gonna take a bath again.
[122:13.46]Okay.
[122:14.78]Well, I think we gotta do what we just did again.
[122:16.96]Yeah, maybe?
[122:24.58]Oh, this is chugging.
[122:28.14]Give me a PS4 Pro.
[122:35.59]No, I guess not.
[122:40.35]What's going on?
[122:41.31]Is that another one?
[122:43.93]Is this more than one of these things?
[122:50.10]I thought this was supposed to be The Last Guardian.
[122:54.30]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[122:55.45]Before you go anywhere.
[122:56.15]He's gonna, like, jump up there, isn't he?
[122:59.15]Come here.
[122:59.63]Come here, come here, come here.
[123:01.79]Don't go chasing.
[123:02.71]Don't go chasing the other cat.
[123:04.23]Wait.
[123:08.55]Look at these pests.
[123:12.88]Alright.
[123:15.54]Uh...
[123:17.86]So we gotta go that way.
[123:20.13]Apparently.
[123:21.19]Well, I need to get back over here, so... Can you, like, move this way for a second, dog?
[123:26.35]Yeah, the second-to-last guardian.
[123:30.68]I need to move so I can jump over here.
[123:33.24]Come here, you.
[123:34.40]You need to be standing right here.

[127:52.26]Right over here!
[127:52.86]God... Do I even need him?
[127:56.94]I don't even think I need him.
[128:01.28]I don't think I even need this dog right now.
[128:04.73]Can I make this on my own?
[128:08.61]Yeah, just watch me.
[128:13.53]Now you want to be helpful.
[128:14.47]Come on.
[128:16.03]You want to be helpful now?
[128:16.75]Is that what you want to do?
[128:18.41]Come over here.
[128:18.73]Be helpful.
[128:20.77]Stay right there.
[128:26.33]I actually have you in a perfect spot right now.
[128:28.09]I wanted to use you to jump on that, but now I'll just use you to jump over here.
[128:33.19]Just please don't fucking go look at a bird.
[128:35.85]Please.
[128:36.59]Don't look at a bird.
[128:38.06]Don't look at a bird.
[128:38.54]Don't look at a bird.
[128:43.36]Oh, you fucker.
[128:44.32]Thank God.
[128:44.90]Okay.
[128:49.83]Okay.
[128:51.29]Alright.
[128:51.59]We're moving on from this now.
[128:54.05]Hopefully.
[128:54.49]Hopefully we don't fuck this up.
[128:57.35]There's a lot of chance that I could fuck it up.
[129:05.58]Alright.
[129:06.56]Oh, dear.
[129:07.40]Okay.
[129:07.82]I gotta be real careful here.
[129:09.14]As I say, I gotta be real careful and then I break the damn thing.
[129:17.58]Just get down.
[129:18.12]I don't want to jump because I don't want to fall.
[129:20.24]Please don't.
[129:22.46]I'm telling you, it's safe.
[129:24.36]Just get down.
[129:27.72]Are you really that scared about falling off this ledge?
[129:32.54]The dog is just like, what are you doing?
[129:34.72]I seriously don't want to jump.
[129:42.83]It's like a little thing right here.
[129:46.35]Can't grab it.
[129:46.85]Okay, I think I made it down.
[129:49.95]Oh boy.
[129:51.45]Alright, this is where we separate the men from the men.
[129:54.29]I have to grab that chain.
[130:25.14]Did that like perfectly stay right there doggy come on Okay, there we go again Here we go again
[130:55.80]Maybe he needs to be up here.
[130:57.02]Can you jump up here, dog?
[130:57.94]Alright, slow down.
[131:04.22]So how did I fuck that up last time?
[131:05.44]I thought I was on a perfect... Can I not reach that?
[131:07.16]Does he have to put his face up here or something?
[131:09.65]Come over here.
[131:16.05]Come on.
[131:19.71]Do you need to be over... I want to make sure he doesn't have to be over here.
[131:21.72]Because it's very possible that he might.
[131:32.44]even matters.
[131:34.68]No.
[131:35.00]I just have to get it.
[131:35.58]I don't think I can even jump that high.
[131:41.98]What is that?
[131:43.64]What is this?
[131:44.50]What is violence?
[131:46.90]I don't want to fucking jump from here.
[131:48.12]I wish he would just fall.
[131:53.66]Okay.
[131:54.90]I have to make this jump, but it looks really far.
[131:57.94]Alright.
[132:00.38]Wish me luck again.
[132:02.62]But even if I get on, if I grab that chain, I don't think it even matters.
[132:06.84]Because how am I going to reach that one?
[132:10.85]Dog, come over here.
[132:14.35]I'm pretty much convinced at this point that he needs to be over here.
[132:19.19]Let's try it again.
[132:22.22]Oh, I got an itchy eye.
[132:26.70]What?
[132:27.16]I hear him.
[132:28.08]Yeah.
[132:28.98]Hello.
[132:30.24]Are you going to do something over here?
[132:37.37]That just looks too high for me to grab it.
[132:39.39]It really does.
[132:40.97]Oh my god, I'm going to fucking shoot my penis.
[132:48.59]I think that might be too far.
[132:49.83]I really do.
[132:54.38]It doesn't look like a physical chain.
[132:55.72]I don't think I can even grab that.
[132:57.06]Let me see if there's anything I missed over here.
[133:07.88]Like, up that way.
[133:08.88]Put your head over here.
[133:11.86]Because, like, it looks like I go up there, but can he just jump there?
[133:15.14]It looks like I have to go there, but damn, how the fuck am I going to get up there?
[133:20.42]Well, put your head over that way, dog.
[133:22.24]I'll try this one more time.
[133:24.68]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[133:26.78]Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[133:28.78]Hold on.
[133:35.15]Come here, dog.
[133:37.67]What about through here?
[133:41.49]Alright, come this way.
[133:46.12]We're going to look over here.
[133:55.84]This looks a little different.
[133:58.52]Hey, keep in here.
[133:59.38]Alright, you're not going to jump anywhere, are you?
[134:06.71]Maybe you are.
[134:10.03]If you're gonna jump, you gotta wait for me, dog.
[134:11.41]I need to be on top of you.
[134:19.01]What is he doing?
[134:19.63]I'm, like, scratching his back.
[134:20.99]Ah, okay.
[134:22.71]There's another one of those plates over there.
[134:28.41]We got... One of these.
[134:33.00]Looks like he's gonna jump to it.
[134:35.14]You wanna jump on there?
[134:36.62]Looks like you can.
[134:40.02]I can go that way.
[134:44.74]20 blip rate.
[134:50.73]Am I going to fall from here?
[134:51.61]I hope not.
[134:53.59]I hope I don't fall from this.
[134:56.87]This does not look like it's very safe, but I'm going to do it anyways.
[135:06.90]Okay.
[135:08.66]Are you going to join me over here?
[135:14.59]I feel like you can knock that over.
[135:15.67]No.
[135:19.83]I just want to look around.
[135:37.11]I don't think I'm supposed to be over here.
[135:39.79]In fact, I'm almost guaranteed I'm not supposed to be over here.
[135:47.69]Oh, up on the wall.
[135:55.72]Slide down.
[135:56.36]Don't fall off the cliff.
[136:01.78]Get down.
[136:02.78]Get down, guy.
[136:03.58]I don't think I can get down from here.
[136:08.46]I think I'm stuck.
[136:08.92]Just slowly, come on, climb down.
[136:14.98]That's what I want to do.
[136:15.64]No.
[136:17.74]Okay, come here.
[136:28.81]Is that ledge up there I can do something with?
[136:30.97]How do I get up there?
[136:41.39]I wonder if I can climb the middle thing if I get him close enough.
[136:43.84]I think I can.
[136:49.08]Put your head out here for a second, dog, so I can get a good look.
[136:58.53]Now, if I'm correct, doesn't he usually jump on these things and perch up?
[137:05.15]Can't really go anywhere from that side.
[137:16.07]I'm gonna assume I can just get up there and shove that thing down.
[137:19.24]Hmm.
[137:24.96]Okay, well.
[137:27.18]Get down.
[137:27.48]Come over here, dog.
[137:31.26]Let's look at this thing.
[137:42.46]I want him to jump up there.
[137:49.94]Alright.
[137:50.42]Jump up on that thing.
[137:52.24]I know you want to.
[137:57.01]Go.
[137:58.11]Do it.
[138:00.11]Do it.
[138:03.39]Do you want to do it?
[138:11.46]So what is it?
[138:11.92]It's R1 and circle, right?
[138:13.58]R1 and square.
[138:14.58]To get him to push forward.
[138:22.28]Uh, dog?
[138:29.59]Okay.
[138:32.41]Come over here.
[138:37.45]You need to be, like, in the right position for this.
[138:41.22]Because I can't climb this.
[138:42.58]I'm not going to be able to.
[138:44.54]He needs to, like, just be in the right spot.
[138:46.28]Come on.
[138:51.18]No, he'd rather just scratch his ears.
[138:59.08]Get him to the top of the column.
[139:00.44]I'm trying.
[139:02.04]He's not listening.
[139:03.22]He's just staring at this wall over here.
[139:05.70]That way.
[139:14.22]I think my dog is broken.
[139:23.74]Get over there, dog.
[139:24.76]Come on.
[139:25.32]What the hell?
[139:31.44]He's just like staring at me.
[139:44.25]This doesn't seem to do anything.
[139:47.75]Can you come over here now?
[139:58.91]I'm going this one.
[139:59.65]Are you going to move now?
[140:03.61]This is all I want you to do.
[140:08.87]Come here.
[140:09.29]Come on.
[140:11.71]There you are.
[140:12.13]Alright.
[140:17.30]What the fuck does that do for me?
[140:21.56]No, he's looking at it.
[140:22.20]He's looking at it now.
[140:24.42]Oh, there he goes.
[140:26.02]He jumped up.
[140:26.62]He actually jumped on top of the damn thing.
[140:34.29]He's like, oh, I did it.
[140:35.19]I did it.
[140:35.49]Did I do it right?
[140:37.11]Well, now I can get your fucking tail.
[140:42.80]Oh, this is going to be a nightmare.
[140:43.84]Okay.
[140:51.96]I was trying to get him to jump on it.
[140:53.37]It's like what I was on top of him.
[140:54.65]I was trying to just direct him on it.
[141:01.81]There we are.
[141:02.65]Okay, dog.
[141:04.11]You did good.
[141:10.16]Now I just stay right there.
[141:12.72]Stay right there while daddy does some work.
[141:18.28]Nothing in here but this.
[141:29.03]It's very dark in here, too.
[141:33.69]I just want to make sure I don't fuck anything up in here.
[141:37.67]I gotta go over there, but what's the point of this being here?
[141:45.86]No.
[141:50.38]Back this way.
[141:53.24]Yeah, there's a bridge there.
[141:54.36]Ooh!
[141:56.23]Treat basket!
[141:57.75]Treat basket!
[142:06.13]There you go.
[142:07.61]I hope you catch this because you better catch it.
[142:12.31]Catch it!
[142:16.45]Nice job.
[142:17.15]Good catch.
[142:17.59]There's another one too.
[142:29.12]Another one for you.
[142:30.24]I don't think I have confidence that you'll catch this one.
[142:35.75]I'm gonna be honest with you, dog.
[142:36.91]I don't know if you're gonna get pretty far.
[142:41.74]Get it!
[142:50.38]How did you catch the other ones?
[142:53.56]Drago!
[142:53.86]Why?
[142:54.04]Why?
[143:05.83]Aww.
[143:06.65]Well, there goes that one.
[143:09.05]He didn't even try.
[143:10.21]I thought, whatever, okay.
[143:13.54]Let's go.
[143:20.62]Oh, broken glass!
[143:21.60]Jesus!
[143:23.20]What the fuck?
[143:24.59]That was kind of terrible.
[143:34.84]See you later, glass.
[143:40.62]Yeah, that treat is gone forever.
[143:45.31]It's gone.
[143:46.29]There's no getting that treat back.
[143:49.83]Alright, new little area here.
[143:51.71]There was another one of those dog people, though.
[143:54.51]Are we gonna get, like, a weird cat-dog fight thing going on here?
[144:00.26]Let's take a look around.
[144:05.28]You can barely fit down here.
[144:07.16]Oh, what a good boy.
[144:07.86]Come here.
[144:08.42]It's like petting a horse's nose.
[144:12.59]Oh, good boy.
[144:13.23]Okay.
[144:15.83]Go downstairs, I'm just gonna assume.
[144:17.95]Because why not?
[144:22.15]He was too full, I guess.
[144:25.39]Maybe.
[144:29.52]Mm-hmm.
[144:30.24]Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.
[144:34.81]Another kind of maze situation we have ourselves in now.
[144:42.42]I need to get another coffee, man.
[144:44.88]Boys and girls, we're going all night.
[144:50.49]Can you zap that wall?
[144:52.45]Maybe if you could fit in there.
[144:54.61]Oh, you are actually fitting down here somehow.
[144:56.97]The fuck are you fitting down here?
[145:05.55]Oh, boy.
[145:06.05]Okay.
[145:10.37]Oh, you made it down here.
[145:12.55]Let me see if we can just go together, you and I. I think you just have to jump, I think?
[145:20.65]Maybe?
[145:32.70]okay well obviously smell something over here he's doing like this what do you smell I don't get it what's over there no I'm just gonna drop down it's probably one of those crates hidden up there somewhere but I can't get it I don't know where to go let's just I'm just gonna go like this
[146:10.03]I was hoping there'd be something there.
[146:14.89]No, I guess not.
[146:15.67]Okay, whatever.
[146:18.95]I'm gonna do a swan dive.
[146:23.02]This is gonna kill me, isn't it?
[146:24.90]Oh, there it is!
[146:25.38]Don't worry, daddy will get the treat for you!
[146:34.91]It's what he smells.
[146:35.69]It's okay, I'm fine.
[146:38.89]There he comes.
[146:41.93]What's going on?
[146:43.43]Oh shit, there's enemies.
[146:45.87]Oh god.

[146:55.57]Go!
[146:56.33]Go!
[146:56.45]There's an invisible spear moving around.
[147:01.41]Come here, come here, come here, come here!
[147:04.67]Save me!
[147:06.76]Where am I?
[147:11.50]Upstairs leg, get me up on him.
[147:20.88]Kick his ass, nice.
[147:21.88]Alright, get this one too.
[147:26.82]Nice, good swipe.
[147:30.44]Excellent swipe, dog.
[147:33.56]Slow down.
[147:41.09]I can't help you if you don't stop moving around.
[147:44.65]Come here.
[147:44.87]Hold on.
[147:45.05]Stop.
[147:45.15]Stop.
[147:45.37]Stop.
[147:45.93]I got him.
[147:46.27]I got him.
[147:46.81]Slow down.
[148:07.60]Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[148:09.13]Swipe left.
[148:09.73]If you pet him in different places, you get different responses.
[148:12.37]Let's pet him right here.
[148:13.63]Yeah, good.
[148:14.67]Have some food.
[148:15.43]You deserve it.
[148:34.12]Shadow of the Colossus 2.
[148:35.64]Big dog.
[148:36.32]That is pretty much what this is.
[148:40.34]Alright, get down to the ground.
[148:43.53]Let's continue to look around to what's in here.
[148:48.23]Any more food baskets?
[148:50.49]For my good dog.
[148:51.57]Oh, Mr. Good Boy.
[148:55.79]I've yet to determine what the hell these things are.
[148:58.29]This is the second one I've seen.
[148:59.55]I don't know what it means.
[149:01.05]And I can't... I don't have my shield, so...
[149:05.69]Anything else to look at in here or can we just keep going?
[149:13.18]Is he a male or female?
[149:14.10]I actually don't know.
[149:15.76]Let's find out.
[149:29.55]That's a female, I think.
[149:38.28]No.
[149:39.04]Actually, I think I might have just seen a penis.
[149:41.42]No, I think it was a feather.
[149:46.90]Here comes the Twitch ban.
[149:48.74]But you can't get banned for animal penis.
[149:51.22]What about the people that show their dogs on camera?
[149:53.52]Guess what?
[149:53.90]Your dog don't wear clothes.
[149:56.60]People that show their dog lying on their backs.
[149:58.63]Like, oh, look at how cute he is.
[150:00.15]It's a dog dick.
[150:01.37]You gonna ban that person?
[150:05.00]Let's take a look.
[150:06.25]Actually, I want to get a coffee.
[150:08.17]I'm going to take a second here.
[150:11.93]A tea break.
[150:12.59]I'll be right back.
[150:13.71]I'm not going to pause it because the dog does funny things when you don't pause the game.
[150:20.66]I'll be right back.
[150:22.72]Hang tight.
[150:23.22]I'll see you in a few minutes.
[151:04.19]Whistle.
[153:06.51]Yeah.
[154:26.66]I just had a real life Last Guardian experience with Otto I kept trying to get him to come down the stairs Because I like to have him in the room with me He just wouldn't No matter how many times I said Oh no!
[154:41.23]He just kind of turned around and walked in a circle But I finally got him down Guess how?
[154:47.85]With One of these, a treat!
[154:50.95]Alright, come here dog
[154:57.18]Alright.
[155:00.50]Back to the game.
[155:06.86]Here we go.
[155:09.46]I just did keyboard and mouse for one second for no reason.
[155:12.49]Alright, where are we going here?
[155:17.07]Just killed a bunch of bad guys.
[155:24.08]There's a hole over here.
[155:24.98]Is that his paw?
[155:27.98]What?
[155:29.14]No, it's not.
[155:29.80]Okay.
[155:34.92]It came from this way.
[155:39.74]That door isn't open.
[155:43.66]Alright.
[155:45.90]It looks like I can get on those.
[155:48.77]Why don't we try and up there?
[155:51.13]Yeah.
[155:51.69]Okay.
[155:52.85]Come here, dog.
[155:55.01]No wait for me, wait for me, wait wait wait for me. Wait for me. Wait wait wait...
[156:00.01]Stop doing a dumb fucking circus act, kid.
[156:02.01]Ah okay, I got it.
[156:08.00]Alright, going up.
[156:12.00]Alright, I'm ready. Go for it.
[156:16.00]Are you gonna go or are you gonna wait for me to jump up there? Or what? Come on.
[156:21.71]Yeah? Yeah?
[156:26.81]Or do you want me to go to this first?
[156:28.83]Okay.
[156:29.27]But a perfect fucking 10 out of 10 jump.
[156:31.33]If that was the Olympics, I just got the gold medal.
[156:35.24]That was a gold medal jump.
[156:37.52]Come on.
[156:44.90]Okay, I think the end of the year news.
[156:58.65]Can we go up any further?
[156:59.53]Oh.
[157:06.46]Eight out of ten.
[157:07.10]No, that was unbelievable.
[157:08.40]That kid should get a medal.
[157:09.96]Turn around.
[157:13.90]There, right?
[157:14.48]Okay.
[157:19.95]Missing secrets.
[157:22.73]It's alright.
[157:23.97]We're not going for a secret run right now.
[157:25.35]Alright, come here, Trico.
[157:30.17]I'm going down here.
[157:35.43]Hey, Trico.
[157:36.97]Let's just go down, apparently.
[157:43.44]Is this where we're supposed to be going?
[157:47.96]I'm going to assume, yeah.
[157:54.60]Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
[157:55.92]Bad guys.
[157:57.12]Bad guys.
[157:57.90]Bad guys.
[157:59.52]I'm just getting trampled.
[158:04.14]I always go to the hind legs, guys.
[158:07.22]The hind legs are where it's at.
[158:11.02]You'll never get hit.
[158:13.38]Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[158:16.28]Oh boy, come on.
[158:17.92]Whoa.
[158:19.41]Whoa.
[158:19.67]Easy.
[158:22.34]I'm gonna pet him in the head.
[158:25.74]That's the best.
[158:27.08]Turning around seems to be pretty difficult.
[158:32.71]There we go.
[158:33.13]Pet!
[158:33.41]Come on, come on!
[158:35.31]Alright.
[158:36.97]You're okay.
[158:38.93]They're just low-tide alien people.
[158:41.75]You're okay.
[158:42.27]Good.
[158:42.51]Alright.
[158:42.71]Do you have any stuff on you?
[158:49.77]Do you have any spears on your body?
[158:52.45]I don't think he does.
[158:53.05]Those are just sword people.
[158:55.15]Maybe throw the spears at him, I think.
[159:00.72]Loud as fuck.
[159:01.66]I know.
[159:02.04]When there's like a fight, it gets really loud.
[159:03.84]I'm sorry about that.
[159:04.56]In fact, let me... Music sound effects.
[159:11.45]Let's just do this.
[159:12.15]Just a little bit.
[159:15.83]Because I feel like it is getting so loud in those cutscenes there.
[159:20.47]Not cutscenes, but you know what I mean.
[159:23.85]Over here.
[159:29.43]Too much dog.
[159:31.03]Too much movement.
[159:41.38]Look at that.
[159:42.06]Go up there.
[159:45.12]Uh, where am I?
[159:45.72]I'm inside of his head.
[159:50.20]Just like that.
[159:51.92]Put your face up.
[159:54.38]Come on, Mr. Good Boy!
[159:55.96]Face up!
[159:59.98]Face up!
[160:01.55]Face up!
[160:06.25]Come on!
[160:09.19]If he puts his head up, I can jump up there.
[160:15.83]Come on!
[160:20.15]No, don't push him.
[160:23.61]He seems to put his head up like that.
[160:25.17]Come on.
[160:25.77]Are you going to get up there or what?
[160:33.56]Looks like you want to.
[160:34.32]Or am I going to have to... I'm stuck right now.
[160:43.24]Come on!
[160:45.46]Come on, you.
[160:49.70]Oh, shit.
[160:50.17]I'm getting angry at him.
[160:55.23]He wants to do it.
[160:56.17]He looks like... Look at him.
[160:58.85]I guess I could just jump up this way.
[161:00.17]Can I grab from here?
[161:01.03]Oh, no.
[161:01.37]He's going to do it, isn't he?
[161:05.24]Yeah, yeah.
[161:06.18]Do it.
[161:09.82]Do it, dog.
[161:12.04]Don't tell me I'm going to have to climb from here.
[161:20.87]Hey, look at that.
[161:21.77]I don't even need you, dog.
[161:30.99]You're too heavy for him.
[161:34.75]I've done this before.
[161:37.10]If he jumped over there, I swear to God, he did.
[161:39.98]You arrogant little dog.
[161:44.44]And I gave you so many treats.
[161:48.06]Alright, watch out.
[161:51.94]Okay, keep going.
[161:59.77]This looks like it's about to get dangerous.
[162:06.05]Are his horns growing?
[162:08.83]Wait, didn't I come from here?
[162:12.28]I think I came from this way.
[162:13.20]Yeah, these are the spirits, right?
[162:18.68]Or maybe not.
[162:22.85]Um, did I come from this way?
[162:26.17]Oh, shit.
[162:27.61]Oh, shit.
[162:29.75]Oh, god.
[162:32.23]Did that just cut his tail off?
[162:36.40]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[162:37.34]I'm so sorry.
[162:38.46]What have I done?
[162:39.14]Ah.
[162:42.62]Shit.
[162:42.98]Can I climb up here?
[162:54.80]Well, dog.
[162:58.12]Is your tail in there?
[163:02.20]Bad owner.
[163:02.96]Alright, what can I do from here?
[163:11.72]Let's take a look.
[163:14.38]Let's see what I can do.
[163:15.40]Um...
[163:24.51]I'm gonna obviously have to press a button somewhere, but how do I get out of here?
[163:29.90]Is his tail caught, or can he get off of this?
[163:31.60]I think it is.
[163:32.28]Can I just grab the tail and, like, pull it?
[163:34.86]Come on, I'll get you out.
[163:36.16]I think I just have to move him off.
[163:42.50]How the hell do I do that?
[163:45.48]Like, pulling his tail off accidentally.
[163:48.04]Something I don't want to do.
[163:48.84]No, I just gotta go around.
[163:53.62]I'll get you, don't worry.
[163:54.61]Okay, I'm coming.
[164:04.26]I'm about to turn on bad guys, though.
[164:17.15]Whoa, he's gonna grab me!
[164:19.47]He's gonna stab me in the fucking... No!
[164:25.58]Let me go!
[164:27.18]Let me go!
[164:31.68]Get off the dog!
[164:32.46]Get off!
[164:33.18]Holy Jesus!
[164:40.86]Alright, he got him.
[164:41.94]He got him.
[164:42.88]He got him!
[164:43.86]Slow down, you got him.
[164:47.79]Alright, slow down, slow down, slow down!
[164:52.61]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[164:59.23]Shhh, please.
[165:00.09]Oh my god, he just fucking smashed me.
[165:08.36]Back it up.
[165:09.54]On his head.
[165:12.29]You're okay.
[165:12.93]You're fine.
[165:16.63]Oh, you're... Look at you.
[165:18.11]Oh, you're so cute.
[165:19.51]Okay.
[165:21.22]So, what the hell did that even do?
[165:24.78]I pulled the lever and the guy came alive.
[165:28.68]I don't really know what that did.
[165:30.14]I'm going to go back in that room and see if there's anything in there instead.
[165:36.95]Oh, that opened that door.
[165:37.89]Okay.
[165:38.93]And there's a... Okay, and we have a bunch more of those dumb mummy idiots down that hallway.
[165:44.65]So... Look, he's just staring at me.
[165:46.69]Looking at me in the face.
[165:48.67]Okay.
[165:50.75]Well, here we go.
[165:59.40]Get on his hind legs.
[166:02.32]He'll take care of everything.
[166:04.42]He's kind of stuck here, though.
[166:11.86]Hopefully they come in one by one.
[166:13.32]Come on, get him!
[166:14.38]There's one right underneath you.
[166:15.18]Get him!
[166:17.48]Get him!
[166:19.82]Get him!
[166:21.52]Oh, God.
[166:22.30]He's not doing anything.
[166:23.32]He's not attacking.
[166:23.90]There he goes.
[166:24.60]There he goes.
[166:31.69]You got any spears in you?
[166:32.55]I gotta get the spears out of him.
[166:41.70]Okay, here we go.
[166:43.58]I'm gonna change the plan.
[166:45.06]Change the plan!
[166:54.14]Alright, I knew if I got him in the... If I was the bait.
[166:58.58]Alright, do you have any spears in you?
[167:03.94]Nice.
[167:04.60]Easy.
[167:05.58]Jesus, dog.
[167:07.18]Stop moving around like crazy.
[167:10.16]Stop.
[167:15.47]Where the hell?
[167:16.29]Calm down.
[167:19.47]Where are the guns?
[167:22.41]I gotta get on his head again.
[167:26.13]Calm down.
[167:31.31]Does he have any spears in him?
[167:32.25]I couldn't really look him over that well.
[167:33.39]I don't think he does.
[167:37.58]No, he'd be freaking out right now.
[167:41.34]Alright, you're good.
[167:42.64]You're good, dog.
[167:43.18]Look at you in the face.
[167:48.29]Alright, I'll be right back.
[167:51.05]I'm going to go take care of something.
[167:52.05]I'm going to go open that door.
[167:52.91]God, come on.
[167:53.53]There's another one.
[167:55.75]There's honestly another guy here.
[167:59.58]Well...
[168:02.73]He's not really paying attention.
[168:16.02]Why did I do that?
[168:17.14]Why did I fucking push him?
[168:18.34]That was stupid.
[168:20.90]That was not fucking... That was just dumb.
[168:26.09]For some reason, I thought I could do something, like push him somehow.
[168:30.31]Just come with me and get yourself killed.
[168:33.83]Keep going.
[168:38.57]Come on.
[168:39.29]Come on.
[168:39.65]I'm going to raise it.
[168:40.31]He's doing the scout taunt.
[168:45.37]Hey, I brought a friend.
[168:46.71]Hey, you're dead.
[168:53.70]Thank you, Clint.
[169:03.13]Slow down again.
[169:05.52]Slow down.
[169:11.70]That was like the exact animation for this guy.
[169:13.84]I'm not even making like a TF2 joke.
[169:17.38]That was just the exact timing.
[169:21.50]Okay, you're good.
[169:23.62]Hopefully now I can release him if I climb up that ladder.
[169:32.81]What is this game?
[169:33.27]A sequel to?
[169:34.05]I don't think it is.
[169:38.08]I'm not sure if this is in the same universe as Shadow of the Colossus or Ico.
[169:40.94]I don't know.
[169:44.76]I know that this is the third game by the people that made those two games.
[169:47.60]But I don't think it's necessarily a sequel or a prequel.
[169:50.88]Though I don't know.
[169:53.22]That could get revealed or something.
[169:54.76]Who knows?
[169:57.56]This looks like it's going to break.
[170:03.17]You're free, dog.
[170:07.79]How far can I pull this?
[170:13.94]Alright, let's make our way out.
[170:16.42]Wait, what is that?
[170:17.16]What is on the ground here?
[170:18.32]Anything important looking?
[170:21.56]A switch.
[170:24.70]No, forget it.
[170:25.16]Let's just go.
[170:32.50]If I'm a cutie, you're a cutie, and the dog's a cutie.
[170:34.44]Yeah, this is just the cutie video game.
[170:36.80]Everyone's a cutie.
[170:39.49]I'm down here.
[170:46.67]Can you fit down here?
[170:50.07]I think you can.
[170:50.53]Why are you being so cautious?
[170:55.52]We made it out.
[170:59.48]We've escaped.
[171:01.26]We got back to the bloom.
[171:05.80]That's what I'm talking about.
[171:07.10]That's what I mean, dog.
[171:19.55]He's gonna jump.
[171:21.63]No, he's not.
[171:24.11]Let's take a look.
[171:31.26]This is a sequel to Lego Star Wars.
[171:35.74]Scale the cliff.
[171:40.06]Go over there.
[171:42.28]There's a switch over there.
[171:43.90]There's nothing over there.
[171:45.70]Alright, dog.
[171:48.82]Follow me!
[171:54.89]It's not a dog, it's a cat bird.
[171:59.52]Uh, he kinda acts like a dog.
[172:04.60]Okay, let me get up on you.
[172:07.34]Over here.
[172:11.96]Alright, now sit.
[172:14.40]Sit down.
[172:18.58]No, I said sit!
[172:20.55]Listen to your master.
[172:21.41]It's like a cat dog.
[172:26.11]It's like a cat bird dog.
[172:28.55]Combination of a lot of... And like a giraffe, too.
[172:30.55]That's like a giraffe face.
[172:32.31]Mixed with a cat.
[172:32.91]Okay, can I reach there from here?
[172:38.42]If he listens to me?
[172:42.30]Let's see.
[172:42.56]I'm gonna get up there.
[172:46.12]Well... If you outstretch a little bit, maybe.
[172:56.05]Is there... There might be a ladder on the other side, too.
[172:59.59]And there's that over there.
[173:05.23]Let's just see what happens if I do this.
[173:08.57]Let me see if there's anything over on the other side.
[173:09.99]No.
[173:13.93]Of course not!
[173:18.33]Why would there be?
[173:19.01]Right here?
[173:32.27]Come over here, buddy.
[173:43.94]I wish you would be right where I'm standing.
[173:46.02]That way.
[173:48.89]Can you go over there, buddy?
[173:52.87]Am I even supposed to be doing it like this?
[173:55.45]I don't know.
[174:07.42]What happened to the mirror shield?
[174:08.36]He ate it.
[174:10.12]Technically.
[174:11.54]Can I squeeze through the gate?
[174:13.38]I might be able to.
[174:14.88]Try that.
[174:16.97]I think it's too much.
[174:22.17]Oh my.
[174:24.81]Well, I'll see you in a minute.
[174:28.15]You can go through the bars, apparently.
[174:29.63]It's so fucking dark.
[174:39.74]How did you get in here?
[174:42.26]How did you get in here?
[174:44.06]How did you get in here?
[174:46.66]You're not supposed to be in here.
[174:50.46]You don't go through those bars, dog.
[174:53.36]You don't fit through the bars.
[174:56.14]Something's got... No, that's not supposed to happen.
[175:01.50]Did he go... Did he jump over?
[175:03.74]He must have jumped over.
[175:07.56]Get out of the way.
[175:12.01]You gotta get out of the way, dog.
[175:15.77]Good thing he can sneak through the bars, too.
[175:17.40]That works.
[175:18.86]That works for both of us.
[175:23.02]Look at this.
[175:23.44]There's a ton of treats over here, too.
[175:24.80]He's gonna be so happy about this.
[175:26.04]Look, I'm not even gonna tell him.
[175:28.34]I'm gonna let him play with them.
[175:29.20]I'm gonna let him break his own stuff open.
[175:31.43]Lookit, lookit.
[175:33.83]What do we got over here?
[175:35.71]I've got a surprise for you.
[175:39.03]Oh, my God.
[175:40.35]It's treat baskets.
[175:42.62]No, look right next to you.
[175:45.86]Do you not see them?
[175:49.92]Right here.
[175:53.02]See?
[175:53.63]Look.
[175:56.89]It's a whole bunch of them.
[175:57.85]There he goes.
[176:00.87]Smash it.
[176:03.49]Smash it.
[176:09.72]There they are.
[176:10.16]Go get them.
[176:14.01]Do you not understand the concept of the box?
[176:16.98]You gotta smash it.
[176:23.26]Come on.
[176:24.02]You're much more intelligent than that, aren't you?
[176:30.00]Okay.
[176:32.16]I think I have to break it open somehow.
[176:33.51]Because I don't think he's smart enough to understand.
[176:35.43]Let me look over here.
[176:44.27]A lot of boxes.
[176:50.68]Locked with iron.
[176:53.72]Couldn't find a way forward.
[176:55.70]Yes, we've developed a bond.
[176:58.04]We have... I gotta get those up there.
[177:22.15]Issue command.
[177:22.75]Yeah, move the boy while holding it.
[177:23.99]Issue command to the beast.
[177:30.92]Get it!
[177:39.72]Get that thing right there!
[177:41.78]Get it!
[177:42.02]You know you want it!
[177:42.80]Get it!
[177:49.89]Okay, what is it telling me to do?
[177:52.37]I think I've been doing these before.
[177:57.75]Duh.
[178:08.86]Here's the question though.
[178:12.02]What do these commands even fucking do?
[178:17.45]Like, is that like the, hey, you, smash it command?
[178:21.05]Smash it.
[178:22.07]Uh, okay.
[178:28.52]Issue commands to the boy.
[178:30.72]By the way, who knows what any of these fucking things do.
[178:38.00]Smash it.
[178:38.40]To me, that looks like the, hey, smash that thing.
[178:46.20]Okay.
[178:47.93]Well.
[178:52.51]That box.
[178:54.29]Uh, X. I don't know what that means.
[178:58.51]Alright, what is this?
[179:03.48]Uh, circle.
[179:04.58]Alright, can you clap like a seal, apparently?
[179:15.78]Okay, I have his attention.
[179:18.52]He's like, he's getting pissed.
[179:23.84]I don't have the shield anymore.
[179:30.53]Come here.
[179:40.93]Do you not understand?
[179:45.40]Okay, well, I have no idea what these commands do.
[179:56.63]It wants me to use them, but... I could not tell you for the life of me what the fuck any of these things are supposed to be doing.
[180:03.73]Like, it's point, and then I do a jump motion.
[180:07.47]Point, I do a push.
[180:13.01]Okay, like...
[180:16.10]I was doing that.
[180:17.10]I was doing that on his head.
[180:19.20]Okay.
[180:25.38]I did that like a few times.
[180:26.66]I guess I have to be riding on top of him.
[180:28.32]Apparently.
[180:30.09]Go ahead and eat the rest of them.
[180:47.91]these horns are getting bigger somehow get it eat it there's one more yeah I I was going like this I was doing hey you go smash that one too
[181:18.72]Let me see if I can get him to do it while not being on him.
[181:22.95]That right there.
[181:24.35]Get it.
[181:29.79]He's just like, oh, I want to play with it.
[181:30.95]That.
[181:31.43]Get it.
[181:31.65]I think you actually have to be riding on top of him for him to listen to those commands.
[181:37.05]Because if I get on top of him... Alright, no.
[181:39.97]He just wanted to take his time doing it, apparently.
[181:43.23]He just wanted to take his time.
[181:44.51]That's alright.
[181:45.53]You're doing a good job.
[181:47.61]Get this last one.
[181:51.56]Hey, you.
[181:53.26]That thing right there?
[181:54.44]Get it!
[182:04.29]He did that one accidentally.
[182:07.89]I don't think he meant to do that one, but it's okay.
[182:13.56]Good job.
[182:15.94]You did a good enough time.
[182:20.90]Good enough.
[182:26.26]What else is in here?
[182:26.94]Anything?
[182:30.02]So that's like attack or swipe.
[182:32.90]So then what does... What does this do?
[182:37.10]That's Sid.
[182:40.35]What is circle?
[182:41.83]Circle is...
[182:49.53]Circle is... I'm not sure what circle does.
[182:56.66]Let me see.
[182:57.60]Let me go down here.
[182:58.22]I just want to make sure I get these down and know what they all actually even do.
[183:03.40]Alright.
[183:04.06]Circle.
[183:06.83]Circle is the clap.
[183:10.35]But what that even means, I'm not sure.
[183:13.25]Is that just like, hey, come over here?
[183:14.25]Or like, go that way?
[183:19.22]And that's, I think that's jump.
[183:24.51]Right?
[183:25.41]Yeah.
[183:26.83]Okay.
[183:27.93]That's jump.
[183:30.23]Good.
[183:33.10]So what does the clap do then?
[183:35.00]Okay.
[183:44.60]Alright, well, let's get out of here.
[183:54.15]Maybe that means get up.
[183:56.87]Yeah, probably.
[183:57.37]Alright, well, I see a place where I can jump to, so... Alright, let's try it out.
[184:03.13]Let's try our new commands out.
[184:04.29]Hey, you.
[184:05.81]Go over there.
[184:10.23]Oh, look.
[184:11.93]Oh, he loves me.
[184:12.88]He's doing it.
[184:19.06]Okay, now I have an understanding of what these things do.
[184:20.74]That's good.
[184:23.38]Now, will he listen if I push his face that way?
[184:27.03]Alright, you.
[184:27.35]That way.
[184:32.23]He's kind of doing it.
[184:33.73]He's kind of doing it.
[184:34.79]Right there.
[184:39.32]Over there.
[184:41.96]Oh.
[184:42.72]Oh.
[184:48.36]This kid has a deep voice.
[184:53.26]That way.
[184:56.74]You can do it.
[184:58.23]You can do it.
[184:59.15]A little bit further.
[184:59.69]Look at him, he's like tilting his head around.
[185:03.87]When does the tutorial end?
[185:06.49]Um... I have no idea.
[185:10.11]Probably like... I don't think there really is a tutorial, really.
[185:13.91]The game just kind of starts.
[185:19.67]Uh, well... What about over there?
[185:22.41]Jump on that.
[185:25.51]That thing over there?
[185:26.39]Jump on it.
[185:26.75]Uh, I'm gonna get off his head.
[185:36.23]That's the problem.
[185:40.07]Because I want him to jump on that thing.
[185:46.54]Alright.
[185:47.90]That thing right there?
[185:49.40]Jump on it.
[185:55.01]Jump on that.
[186:02.11]Come on, buddy!
[186:04.09]This thing.
[186:04.53]Jump on this thing.
[186:11.92]Jump on this thing.
[186:12.50]No, wrong button.
[186:27.70]That thing?
[186:28.44]Right there?
[186:29.78]Jump on that thing!
[186:32.86]Is he gonna do it?
[186:34.84]Do it!
[186:42.63]Ah, Tranko!
[186:46.98]Jump that way!
[186:49.98]Did I feed Otto?
[186:50.84]I did feed Otto.
[186:53.34]See, you're being a good dog, but you have to jump on that thing, because that looks like the way we do it.
[186:57.55]That looks like how we complete the mission, good boy.
[187:04.69]Is he lying down?
[187:06.45]He's just, like, sick of my shit, apparently, at this point.
[187:08.81]Okay, we're gonna do this again.
[187:12.89]Over there.
[187:16.53]let go this way he's gonna jump off wish what the fuck this thing this thing right here jump on that thing
[187:51.13]Do you not understand?
[187:51.99]I'm trying to tell you.
[187:55.03]That thing.
[187:56.39]Jump.
[188:02.09]Okay, dog.
[188:06.19]Okay.
[188:09.85]Are you getting ready to do what I want you to do?
[188:11.51]Alright, so let me get this straight.
[188:20.05]I have to hold R1, point, and hit triangle.
[188:23.53]And he should jump.
[188:25.79]But, I thought that he's kind of just looking around.
[188:33.40]Can I jump on?
[188:34.00]I'm sure I can, but I want to make sure I get this down, you know?
[188:36.32]I need a YouTube tutorial to play it.
[188:45.12]Um...
[188:50.87]No, but the one thing that I did read about reviews is the dog, like, the dog sometimes just does not do what you want him to do.
[188:57.27]That was the one bad thing I read about in reviews.
[189:00.36]It's like, the dog is, like, hard to control, and sometimes he's just a fucking idiot.
[189:04.90]Come over here.
[189:11.02]It's probably not supposed to work?
[189:12.28]I mean, that very clearly looks like something he's supposed to jump onto.
[189:19.54]He jumps on these things like all the time, doesn't he?
[189:22.46]Well, whatever.
[189:24.06]Come here, you.
[189:31.37]Just like a real dog.
[189:33.95]Well, I'm gonna try just to get on top of this and see if I can just make him do it.
[189:42.18]Alright, put your head back over there.
[189:44.88]My dog friend.
[189:50.55]Turn this way.
[189:51.27]Can you move over here for me, buddy?
[189:56.51]Thank you.
[189:56.93]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[190:05.08]I know there's like scripted events where he's supposed to jump on things, but I'm just making sure I can... I have no idea.
[190:12.36]I'm up here now, though.
[190:17.80]Oh, what else is up here?
[190:18.97]Let's take a little look.
[190:26.73]Any treats?
[190:32.25]See?
[190:32.49]Alright, so for all you guys saying that he wasn't going to jump on this and that he was too big to fit on it.
[190:41.77]He's up there now.
[190:47.93]He went up there that time.
[190:52.30]Coming over here.
[190:58.44]What else is there to do over here, though?
[191:02.37]I thought somebody was shooting a gun.
[191:12.27]Alright, well... Dog, follow me over there.
[191:19.63]Get him some Pop-Tarts.
[191:24.84]Will he actually follow me down here?
[191:26.30]He kind of has to, right?
[191:34.09]Are you gonna jump up there?
[191:34.99]No?
[191:36.79]You're just gonna go this way?
[191:40.18]Okay.
[191:47.52]I've been playing chess.
[191:50.64]Well, I feel like those commands are gonna be very important later on in the game.
[191:53.72]I want to try to make sure I can get them to work.
[192:02.68]Okay, I still... Guys, there was no way he was supposed to be in there, I don't think.
[192:08.14]Maybe he was somehow.
[192:11.37]But now that that's open... Well, what the hell did we do?
[192:18.07]Over there?
[192:18.43]Oh, I see a treat.
[192:21.61]I see treats.
[192:26.89]I guess we can go try to get it.
[192:38.18]Yeah, I don't think he was supposed to be through that gate.
[192:42.20]I have no idea what the hell happened there.
[192:45.84]Go that way.
[192:53.27]Turn around.
[192:55.81]Turn, little dog, turn.
[192:57.03]Now I'm going to get off him.
[193:05.33]I love how much I've just been, like, injured by doing this.
[193:09.85]Alright, go.
[193:13.13]Go this way.
[193:14.53]Can you jump over there while I jump on your back, kind of?
[193:19.43]And see if I can climb up after you jump.
[193:23.95]Nope.
[193:25.03]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[193:27.99]Nope.
[193:31.73]What the fuck is going on right now?
[193:33.85]His head is just inside the door.
[193:35.73]Something's going wrong.
[193:37.77]Something's not supposed to be happening.
[193:41.09]Hello?
[193:43.55]Dog?
[193:43.95]Your head's like stuck in the wall?
[193:47.00]Alright, what about if you go over there?
[193:56.02]Can you do that for me?
[193:58.85]Put your face up.
[193:59.51]There's a tree up there.
[194:00.28]I'm telling you, you're going to want it.
[194:05.48]Over there.
[194:06.44]Put your face over there.
[194:09.34]No, he's looking at something else.
[194:12.84]Are you going to... Go for it.
[194:15.83]There you are.
[194:21.99]Oh, I got it.
[194:23.19]Hey, easy, easy.
[194:27.96]Easy, get your hands down.
[194:29.38]Put your hands down.
[194:30.42]You're gonna make me fall.
[194:31.92]Get off.
[194:32.80]Get down.
[194:34.16]Get down.
[194:35.84]What are you doing?
[194:36.64]Let me... He's just fucking sticking me in the back.
[194:43.04]Get out of the way.
[194:43.86]Oh my god.
[194:46.22]Sit down.
[194:47.48]Sit.
[194:47.92]Oh, fuck.
[194:53.44]God damn it.
[194:59.88]I'm glad that he's still up here, though.
[195:04.66]Don't get down.
[195:05.60]Don't be the opportunity where you get down.
[195:07.48]I have a treat.
[195:08.04]There's a little... It's right there.
[195:09.59]There we go.
[195:17.23]There you go.
[195:19.79]You've been very good.
[195:21.15]You deserve this.
[195:21.94]God damn.
[195:32.27]Why?
[195:33.23]It's right next to you.
[195:35.87]Go get it.
[195:40.05]No, get down from here.
[195:41.39]Go get the treat.
[195:45.13]It's right there.
[195:45.71]You're going to love it.
[195:48.31]Can I do anything else here?
[195:52.14]Oh, boy.
[195:53.90]Alright, get down.
[195:55.66]Get down, get down, get down, get down.
[196:02.84]Your favorite thing in the world.
[196:04.18]See?
[196:06.76]There it is.
[196:07.24]Go get it.
[196:09.10]Go eat it.
[196:18.89]Come on.
[196:20.83]You don't want that food?
[196:23.15]I know you want that food.
[196:29.17]Here he goes.
[196:29.73]He's looking at it now.
[196:33.70]You just missed it.
[196:34.38]Alright, has he been getting stupider?
[196:39.90]I think I need to keep feeding these or else his brain fluid is draining.
[196:45.77]He just tried to eat that and didn't even get it.
[196:47.49]He just missed.
[196:57.73]You couldn't eat it.
[197:03.88]Eat it!
[197:07.79]Eat it!
[197:09.01]Eat it!
[197:10.19]Eat it!
[197:12.49]Alright, I'm picking it up.
[197:14.49]That's it.
[197:15.79]We're done here.
[197:18.67]That's it.
[197:19.25]Yeah, you really want this, don't you?
[197:21.31]Alright, eat it.
[197:23.15]Take it.
[197:25.50]Go get it.
[197:25.82]It's right there.
[197:26.32]Oh, I figured out how to eat it.
[197:30.34]Thank you.
[197:32.68]Alright.
[197:33.56]What the hell were we doing?
[197:36.62]I completely forgot where the fuck we were going.
[197:39.87]Over here?
[197:40.21]Uh, I... Over here.
[197:43.99]We're gonna look over here.
[197:46.99]Throw it off the cliff?
[197:47.85]Oh, that would be so cruel.
[197:48.91]No, no way.
[197:49.95]I couldn't do that to my friendly dog friend.
[197:57.76]What is over here?
[197:58.62]Ooh, look what I found.
[197:59.90]Another one.
[198:07.34]Throwing it off the cliff in front of him.
[198:08.40]That's just so cruel.
[198:19.30]Turn on the auto cam.
[198:24.36]We'll get an auto cam here.
[198:26.06]I'll show you my dog cam soon.
[198:32.41]30 years in development for this trash streamer?
[198:35.08]Hey.
[198:37.52]That's not very nice.
[198:41.90]Okay, here you go.
[198:45.80]Actually eat this one.
[198:46.94]See, look at that.
[198:47.48]He ate it immediately.
[198:50.28]Why did it take him five minutes to eat the first one and then, like, he decided to eat that one the second I put it down?
[198:57.89]Alright, do we go across the bridge here?
[199:01.43]Did we come from this way?
[199:02.39]I can't even remember.
[199:03.17]No, I don't think so.
[199:04.33]Maybe we did, but it gives a shit.
[199:05.69]We're gonna go back.
[199:07.04]Because this in here is... What was down here?
[199:12.82]Yeah, this is okay.
[199:13.32]I've already been down here.
[199:14.00]This is where he got his, like, tail caught.
[199:15.88]Okay.
[199:17.48]Let's go across the bridge.
[199:21.28]Alright, you.
[199:22.62]You see here?
[199:23.23]We're gonna do this.
[199:26.55]Right here?
[199:26.91]I want you to go that way, and I want you to jump!
[199:38.62]Yeah, you're getting there.
[199:46.13]You got it?
[199:54.09]Go for it.
[199:56.45]You know you want to do that.
[199:57.31]You're getting ready to do the jump.
[199:59.33]Come on, I told you to jump.
[200:00.93]You can do it.
[200:03.57]I know you can.
[200:08.77]Where are you going?
[200:22.91]What's wrong?
[200:25.98]Alright, we're going to turn you around here.
[200:32.70]That way.
[200:39.60]He's looking around for me.
[200:41.18]Okay.
[200:47.57]Come here.
[200:48.23]We're going to do this again.
[200:50.63]We're going to do it real slow.
[200:51.47]What are you doing?
[200:57.31]Alright.
[200:57.83]Alright.
[200:58.11]Alright.
[200:58.45]Right here.
[200:58.75]Right here.
[200:59.13]Good.
[200:59.37]Very good.
[200:59.93]Nice work.
[201:01.35]Wait for me.
[201:01.87]Wait.
[201:02.71]Wait.
[201:03.77]Wait.
[201:04.19]Wait.
[201:13.43]This dog, man.
[201:14.35]I swear to God.
[201:18.05]Alright, we made it across.
[201:22.31]Okay.
[201:29.33]Anything else here that I can do?
[201:31.71]Something with the door?
[201:34.09]Can't zap the door.
[201:40.80]Um...
[201:43.15]Hard to tell, really, over here.
[201:44.35]Right there?
[201:45.29]Alright, come here, dog.
[201:52.38]Hey, lookit.
[201:53.18]You came immediately.
[201:54.40]What a good boy.
[201:55.18]Alright, now just stay right there.
[202:05.37]The AI is pretty accurate for a dog.
[202:08.25]I mean, it is.
[202:12.89]Alright, slow down here.
[202:15.95]Now, do the thing you did before where you put your hands on the... No, no, no, no, no!
[202:19.37]I didn't... No!
[202:20.84]Stop moving!
[202:22.18]I didn't tell you to do this!
[202:23.48]Why are you going over here?
[202:24.38]No, stop it!
[202:28.16]What are you, like, curling around this for?
[202:30.68]Where are you going?
[202:37.28]Come back over here!
[202:39.24]I want you to be right there so I can jump on this.
[202:44.01]Come over here and you need to sit.
[202:48.26]Come here.
[202:51.52]Sit down.
[202:52.80]Sit right there and don't move.
[203:00.83]No, no, sit, sit, sit, sit.
[203:03.11]Sit.
[203:09.39]Stay.
[203:10.79]Sit.
[203:11.93]No, stay.
[203:12.93]Stay, stay, stay.
[203:16.87]God damn it.
[203:18.59]Dog.
[203:19.97]Dog, don't you do this to me.
[203:21.91]No, don't.
[203:25.31]Okay.
[203:26.49]Okay.
[203:27.63]Now you just need to... You just need to...
[203:40.44]You just have to stay right here.
[203:42.06]You just have to sit right here.
[203:44.30]That's all you have to do.
[203:48.08]What are you doing?
[203:48.76]What?
[204:00.99]What the fuck are you doing?
[204:02.23]What?
[204:05.91]What?
[204:12.24]Is he gonna break through the door?
[204:17.40]Can I, like, get under it when he does that?
[204:23.42]He has to pee.
[204:24.12]Let him out.
[204:24.54]Alright.
[204:27.27]Okay, Otto.
[204:28.57]Come here.
[204:32.25]Come here.
[204:34.77]Attack this.
[204:39.50]Attack it.
[204:40.82]Shove your fist through that door.
[205:02.28]Hit his fucking head.
[205:04.18]Hit the fucking door.
[205:06.50]Come on.
[205:07.62]Get it.
[205:08.62]You can do it.
[205:09.26]That's not gonna work.
[205:16.96]That's not gonna work.
[205:18.95]That is definitely not gonna work.
[205:20.25]But he's gonna... Don't do it again.
[205:21.77]You don't have to do it again.
[205:22.77]You don't have to do it again.
[205:24.09]You're gonna hurt yourself.
[205:26.73]You don't... Please don't do that again.
[205:28.41]I don't wanna...
[205:35.28]Stop it.
[205:36.88]Stop doing that.
[205:40.28]You don't have to do that.
[205:41.42]It's okay.
[205:42.20]Calm down.
[205:44.87]There you go.
[205:45.45]Good dog.
[205:46.15]Okay.
[205:49.25]Let's get a look.
[205:50.01]What about putting his hands up there?
[205:59.65]Can you put your paws up there for me?
[206:04.48]Put your hands up there.
[206:07.46]Yeah, I know.
[206:08.02]I just dissed you to command to him.
[206:09.20]I wanted to put his hands up there.
[206:10.99]Okay.
[206:14.39]Can I go from here and jump?
[206:19.47]I believe I can.
[206:22.03]Jeez.
[206:23.58]Alright.
[206:24.02]Well, you obviously can't get in there.
[206:29.52]Always an auto-KM.
[206:33.46]I'll give you an auto-cam.
[206:34.34]Hold on.
[206:35.98]Once we get in this door... This poor dog.
[206:47.69]There's nothing I can pull up here.
[206:48.85]This is where I wanted to go before.
[206:53.49]No.
[206:53.75]I gotta probably go around.
[206:54.75]There's probably a way to get inside.
[206:56.22]Oh, man.
[206:59.10]That was pretty funny.
[207:03.10]Another way to go down.
[207:04.46]No lever or switch to pull here.
[207:08.34]No.
[207:10.06]Okay.
[207:17.24]I'm assuming I just gotta... Yep.
[207:22.05]Okay.
[207:23.65]Okay.
[207:34.07]Ooh, look at that.
[207:35.81]A little hole.
[207:39.22]I would not have seen that if it didn't put the camera right there.
[207:46.64]This is intricate looking.
[207:47.82]Alright, hold on.
[207:48.68]You want a dog cam?
[207:51.17]I'll give it to you.
[207:51.63]You want to see my dog?
[207:57.75]For those of you that have never seen him before.
[208:03.20]He wants to be with you.
[208:05.10]He is a good boy.
[208:05.90]Alright.
[208:06.18]Look at my little good boy.
[208:07.38]He just woke up.
[208:08.40]Let's take a look at him.
[208:13.63]There it is.
[208:17.17]And, hey, look at that dog.
[208:20.71]This is my dog.
[208:21.41]This is my little Otto.
[208:23.79]In his bed under the covers.
[208:26.37]Hey.
[208:29.23]Do you want a treat?
[208:30.34]Oh.
[208:31.85]What if I got you one of those treat baskets?
[208:39.28]He's like, leave me alone.
[208:40.40]There you go.
[208:42.96]This is my dog.
[208:45.76]Funnily enough, he does the same shit that Trico does.
[208:50.56]Very realistic.
[208:53.19]Also, I guess I'll take a minute here to say thank you to Nightbane394.
[208:56.11]Thanks for the sub.
[208:58.35]Super Eyes Butt.
[209:00.65]Almost three months.
[209:01.71]Thanks a lot.

[209:15.03]Thanks for sticking around for two months.
[209:17.45]I eat ghost food for ten months.
[209:20.63]More months than I actually own your soul.
[209:22.59]A few more months and you own my soul.
[209:25.75]Why would you own me?
[209:28.70]That's a pretty hefty price.
[209:34.42]No, I do not make my dog bash his head into metal doors.
[209:37.95]I don't, I promise.

[209:40.91]Thanks a lot.

[209:42.01]No, game doesn't.
[209:42.99]Here's the thing, right?
[209:45.43]The game doesn't suck.
[209:48.05]If you were wondering, if you're watching the stream to find out if The Last Guardian sucks, it doesn't suck.
[209:54.21]It's a lot different than any game that you probably ever played, though.
[209:58.49]It requires patience and training your brain to not... Because you can't do anything.
[210:04.31]You're just a little kid.
[210:05.23]I mean, you can climb really high, but... I like it so far.
[210:10.25]We'll see after another few hours how I feel, but... Who knows?
[210:15.68]Uh, Jaharv, thanks for the sub.

[210:25.56]Coldest Fridge for three months.
[210:28.24]Today's my birthday and I wouldn't want to spend it any other way than to watch you play some games.
[210:32.09]You have really inspired me in the three and a half years I've watched you.
[210:35.69]And I thank you for inspiring me all these years.
[210:37.23]Well, thanks a lot, Coldest Fridge.
[210:38.75]I'm glad I can be an inspiration.
[210:41.75]If I am.
[210:42.55]Thanks.

[211:37.14]Do you think this is a decent dating profile bio?
[211:41.75]You like dogs, coffee, Cheetos, wrestling.
[211:45.71]Should I make my any modifications?
[211:48.47]No, it's perfect, Tenant.
[211:49.71]That's a perfect dating profile.
[211:53.07]Thank you, Rayburn.
[211:54.59]200 bits for a PS Pro fund.
[211:57.00]No, I'm not going to get a PS4 Pro.
[211:59.80]I don't see a reason to get it.
[212:03.40]So I can play like 4K movies or something eventually?
[212:05.68]Who gives a shit?
[212:09.77]And I can run The Last Guardian at like 30 frames a second?
[212:11.85]Who gives a shit?
[212:12.61]You know what I mean?
[212:14.33]But thanks a lot, guys.
[212:16.13]Welcome back to subs.
[212:16.89]Thanks for the bits.
[212:17.71]And we're going to keep playing.
[212:19.43]I almost just ran off the edge.
[212:20.70]Alright, what do we got?
[212:24.53]This looks tricky.
[212:29.93]Any other holes to go in?
[212:32.73]I have a 780.
[212:33.65]A 780 streamer?
[212:34.49]I am a 780 streamer.
[212:35.43]I'm proud of my 780.
[212:37.57]It's gotten me through lots of shit in the past.
[212:40.61]You know what I mean?
[212:48.26]Nope.
[212:55.68]Lever to pull.
[212:56.42]Is there one somewhere around here?
[213:00.18]Don't be stupid.
[213:01.28]Oh, there's a guy.
[213:01.86]There's a rotating guy with a gun.
[213:04.75]You see that?
[213:07.35]Alright.
[213:08.09]If this was Dark Souls, I would jump off this and hit R1.
[213:10.09]And the guy would die in one second.
[213:12.51]Okay, I see that I gotta pull that thing.
[213:16.33]Shit, this is not gonna go well, is it?
[213:19.19]I feel like if I don't stand in that light, he won't see me.
[213:23.36]But I've been wrong before, so you know.
[213:28.82]Let's just climb this.
[213:33.74]Should be over here.
[213:51.89]Can drop from here, can I?
[214:01.34]I hope this doesn't fucking kill me.
[214:04.00]Oh, alright.
[214:07.33]Cool.
[214:16.37]I think I'm okay falling from here.
[214:24.58]I hope I am.
[214:27.62]I think so.
[214:33.68]Yep, I'm fine.
[214:36.07]I just gotta give it a... I gotta let my bones rest after I broke, like, all of them again.
[214:42.91]So we're gonna time this right, just go over there.
[214:52.06]Let me just take a look over here.
[214:56.66]See what's over this way.
[215:01.22]I need dog for this stuff.
[215:09.86]Okay, let's get this right.
[215:11.06]That one's pointing.
[215:11.86]That one's pointing this way.
[215:16.00]I guess I could go there.
[215:20.59]They don't look like they're very far.
[215:21.73]They don't point very far.
[215:25.71]I think as long as I don't get hit by the one on the right, I'll be fine.
[215:34.36]I'm going to go after this one.
[215:37.44]And then in comes the dog.
[215:38.76]He's gonna break through and he can destroy these things.
[215:40.76]Let's... Careful.
[215:46.33]Okay, go.
[215:49.63]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[215:50.37]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[215:51.15]Get in here, dog.
[215:54.37]Good.
[216:07.91]Yes.
[216:08.43]He's in.
[216:10.15]Okay.
[216:16.57]Nice work.
[216:20.22]Both dead?
[216:21.36]Nice work.
[216:24.76]Good job, dog.
[216:27.06]Very good dog.
[216:28.26]Drop it on his head.
[216:32.72]It's done.
[216:33.60]That would be terrible.
[216:39.42]Now there's some gameplay.
[216:47.05]No, you're okay.
[216:51.11]Straight ahead.
[216:51.67]Just go forward.
[216:55.59]And I can make him jump up that.
[217:03.55]Put your paws on it.
[217:08.11]And then I can climb the ladder and wrap around.
[217:13.43]You know what to do.
[217:17.89]You know what to do, dog.
[217:24.59]Yeah, you know what to do.
[217:26.01]Come on.
[217:29.57]Thanks for the doggo.
[217:30.35]Well, thanks for sticking around, Chaos.
[217:34.63]There we go.
[217:36.78]You listened.
[217:37.28]You listened, good boy.
[217:39.40]That's what you're supposed to be doing.
[217:44.26]Slow the fuck down.
[217:48.40]That doesn't do anything.
[217:49.22]Make sure I don't miss something.
[217:57.28]No.
[218:03.28]You gotta give it treats.
[218:04.10]I wish I could.
[218:07.02]Now we're back outside on the fucking skyscraper.
[218:09.32]No, stay.
[218:10.04]Don't fucking go back that far.
[218:17.91]No, I want to go this way.
[218:20.71]Come on.
[218:23.59]I hope I can stay on this.
[218:25.10]I can.
[218:28.38]I can.
[218:30.48]Need more jokes to fix the ratio?
[218:35.66]It scares me every time.
[218:45.11]I think I've only died twice.
[218:46.11]I don't think I've died more than two times.
[218:49.85]I'm not sure what the end of this is going to do for me.
[219:00.26]If anything at all.
[219:00.98]Hold on.
[219:01.82]Climb up this.
[219:06.88]Huh.
[219:20.63]Well... Um... Oh, right here.
[219:33.56]Okay, I see.
[219:43.97]Wait, because I took like an extra five seconds to see the hole?
[219:47.79]Come on, guys.
[219:49.94]Give me some slack.
[219:53.74]I was gonna see it.
[219:55.10]I just needed to look for the hole.
[219:56.94]I didn't know the hole was there.
[219:58.45]Come on.
[220:00.39]Give me a little bit of fucking slack.
[220:13.00]Kind of back where I was back here, though.
[220:19.05]Let's get back down here.
[220:20.21]Let me see.
[220:21.07]I can't really tell.
[220:21.89]Where's Trico?
[220:23.62]Is he on this side?
[220:24.74]He's on that side.
[220:29.38]Yo!
[220:30.10]Why am I whispering?
[220:33.57]Yeah, yeah.
[220:38.54]Well, there's another one of these.
[220:39.66]Oh, shit.
[220:41.00]This one's going to be a little bit more tricky.
[220:42.18]Okay.
[220:42.44]Let's be careful.
[220:44.46]Hang down.
[220:44.98]And we have another one of those mirror things over there.
[220:53.68]The kaleidoscopes.
[221:00.99]There's one, two.
[221:02.91]There's a lot of them.
[221:04.25]This is going to suck.
[221:21.03]Long way away.
[221:31.16]Right here, right?
[221:35.42]Okay.
[221:47.39]Now this doesn't... I know this doesn't kill me, so... Just gonna wait for this to go all the way around.
[221:53.02]And let's go.
[221:58.04]This fuckhead every time.
[221:59.64]I swear.
[222:01.06]Oh, I'm gonna get caught.
[222:05.48]Oh, no.
[222:06.32]Don't get... Okay.
[222:09.38]Let my bones heal.
[222:11.89]I'll be good to go.
[222:16.77]This one's going to be trickier because I have to maneuver around.
[222:19.71]Is there a safe spot up on the right?
[222:25.51]I'm just going to let this pass one more time.
[222:27.71]No, that doesn't look like it.
[222:28.60]Maybe it is.
[222:29.22]See all the way to the right there?
[222:30.02]Does this actually see it?
[222:30.98]I don't think so.
[222:38.24]I wonder.
[222:39.16]It might be safe to stand in that corner over there.
[222:48.43]I could just run up straight ahead, maybe?
[222:55.61]No.
[222:59.94]Let's see.
[223:00.42]It doesn't look like anything's pointing that way.
[223:03.78]I'm going to try that.
[223:08.66]Oh, you know what?
[223:09.18]Fuck that.
[223:09.64]There we go.
[223:13.00]Can I just fall down there and then jump up?
[223:14.88]I think I can.
[223:20.82]Yeah, I can definitely climb up that way.
[223:22.40]Let's do that.
[223:22.90]There's another way to go down here.
[223:39.46]Let me see what's over this way.
[223:51.89]Nothing really.
[223:52.89]I could go that way, but let me just open that shit.
[224:02.60]So now I can, when that thing goes around, I'll be fine.
[224:07.00]Clever, Jerva.
[224:10.93]Slow it.
[224:11.79]Jeez.
[224:12.63]It's just so dark down here.
[224:13.81]Fuck.
[224:14.07]Alright, I wish I could see so I don't get spotted when the light is over here.
[224:19.93]Oh, I can see right there.
[224:28.01]Here comes the light.
[224:29.77]Once it goes up... Ooh, wait a minute!
[224:32.40]He just saw me.
[224:32.98]I don't think it mattered, though.
[224:38.36]Go, go, go, go, go!
[224:41.36]Ooh, this is gonna be real close.
[224:44.99]This is gonna be close.
[224:51.21]Hmm...
[225:03.27]No, I want to... That was too close to call there.
[225:07.03]I was going to get caught.
[225:10.33]Although it's pushed open a little bit.
[225:11.82]I'll be good.
[225:15.86]Pushed open enough.
[225:16.46]Now I'll get out in the second one.
[225:21.18]Coward.
[225:21.90]I was going to get caught.
[225:25.67]Now it's open enough where I'll get it.
[225:34.73]I would love it if you would go down.
[225:35.73]That would be just great, little kid.
[225:41.13]Coward.
[225:41.55]Hey, you can call me a coward, but I'm gonna complete the area.
[225:45.89]I would have had to start over.
[225:55.52]Where is it?
[225:56.92]Hey, look at you.
[226:01.86]And... go.
[226:09.67]Get in here, Trico!
[226:18.69]Get in!
[226:21.86]He's in!
[226:22.78]He's in!
[226:23.72]He's in!
[226:25.22]He's in!
[226:29.88]He's like accidentally stomping me.
[226:40.80]Here comes the ripper.
[226:45.67]Only two more.
[226:46.33]Oh, that was a double kill.
[226:49.29]Nice job, Trico.
[226:51.23]No, no, let's go one more.
[226:53.67]He's just stomping the shit out of me.
[227:03.93]Nice.
[227:05.35]That's it.
[227:08.40]Alright, you did good.
[227:12.14]Oh, he smashed his head in the ceiling.
[227:16.57]780 frames.
[227:18.05]Stop hitting you!
[227:20.97]He is bashing his brains into the ceiling.
[227:26.03]It's all... It's okay.
[227:31.33]We're in the darkness right now.
[227:34.97]Okay.
[227:36.39]Nice job, Trico.
[227:40.30]One more.
[227:40.76]I'm going to assume that I have to do this one more time.
[227:42.48]Hey, it's alright.
[227:44.57]Come here.
[227:51.13]Follow your nose.
[227:58.71]One more time.
[227:59.37]It's going to be even more complicated.
[228:01.92]What?
[228:11.22]What is he doing?
[228:13.76]Oh, I can't believe I witnessed the secret of Trico.
[228:16.04]He shakes around a little bit.
[228:24.03]Let's do it again.
[228:28.07]Well, it runs perfectly fine on PS Pro, apparently.
[228:31.91]But I have just a regular PS4.
[228:42.07]Alright, we're going to do it just like last time.
[228:45.50]Just like last time.
[228:48.94]No, I don't want you to do that.
[228:51.20]Over there.
[228:52.68]There you go.
[228:54.71]Get us up there, right in that hole.
[229:00.95]Over that way.
[229:02.61]That one.
[229:05.82]Put your paws up.
[229:12.50]There you are.
[229:13.56]Good job.
[229:20.05]It's gonna be another one of these dumb laser light show enemies.
[229:22.99]Isn't it?
[229:25.17]Isn't it?
[229:26.03]No, it's not.
[229:26.57]It's just foggy.
[229:32.94]There we are.
[229:33.44]Okay.
[229:34.90]Hey, this was an easy puzzle.
[229:43.05]Doing a whole lot of pulling levers so a dog can go through a door.
[229:48.49]I just spilled coffee all over me.
[229:50.99]I tried to take a sip too fast.
[229:57.02]Come on in.
[230:02.26]Oh yeah, he's scared of the eyeball.
[230:04.36]He's scared of the Illuminati symbol.
[230:11.60]Yeah, he's terrified.
[230:12.24]He won't come in here.
[230:13.11]This is gonna kill me, isn't it?
[230:15.43]I'm getting really, really cocky doing that shit, and one of these times I'm gonna die.
[230:18.91]Yeah, here it is.
[230:34.80]Don't worry.
[230:36.98]It's gone!
[230:37.42]It's gone!
[230:37.78]It's gone!
[230:38.08]It's gone!
[230:38.52]It's gone!
[230:42.20]I got rid of the bad scary monster under your bed.
[230:53.53]Slow down.
[230:54.37]Wish me to get on you.
[231:00.03]He's got a mind of his own right now.
[231:05.85]It's right up there.
[231:06.41]You know what to do.
[231:08.89]Look, he's been trained so well.
[231:17.17]Well, let's stop moving for a second so I can tell where the hell I am.
[231:26.08]No, shit.
[231:27.62]There's not a door.
[231:28.14]There's not... I can't even get in there.
[231:30.82]Shit.
[231:33.88]Does he have to jump again?
[231:35.64]Maybe he has to jump a second time.
[231:39.07]Yeah, he's gonna go that way.
[231:40.01]Yep.
[231:45.47]Again?
[231:45.73]I guess we're going to do it again.
[231:51.11]Can I go in there?
[231:53.77]See if he'll jump again.
[231:54.46]Trico.
[231:58.88]Are you going to do it again?
[232:01.86]Of course you are.
[232:06.62]Almost at the top.
[232:11.78]Another jump?
[232:18.05]And then I'm going to go up there and be it, I think, right?
[232:20.17]I'm going to put his hands up and I can jump over there and see what's in this room.
[232:32.22]Look at how smart he is now.
[232:35.48]He's so intelligent now.
[232:41.48]We've been together for so long.
[232:44.59]Is he not?
[232:46.07]Alright, what's in here?
[232:51.29]Any levers to pull?
[232:54.50]How did you do that?
[232:55.10]How did you?
[232:55.40]Wait, wait, wait!
[232:56.00]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't!
[232:58.04]It's okay.
[232:58.52]No, I can go through.
[233:00.18]I, for a second, thought I was going to have to redo that again.
[233:08.52]Chain.
[233:12.58]It won't last.
[233:16.40]Well, it's very obvious what I have to do.
[233:29.36]Calm your tits.
[233:30.22]I just didn't want to get locked out.
[233:35.60]Come up here, dog.
[233:47.90]Well, I can pull that switch.
[233:49.08]Might as well do that first.
[233:50.64]Good jump.
[234:07.50]You solved an easy puzzle, have you?
[234:13.53]Gotta light all the lanterns?
[234:14.63]Is that what I gotta do?
[234:17.69]Oh, the music's playing.
[234:20.37]Oh, there he goes.
[234:26.08]Oh, dear.
[234:26.54]Okay.
[234:28.34]Okay.
[234:36.86]Is there a tail I can grab?
[234:38.12]Yeah, I can from the cord.
[234:39.94]Hold on.
[234:40.34]Stick around over there for a second, dog.
[234:43.22]I need to grab that tail.
[234:55.09]Can you do that again?
[234:55.99]Can you do that again for me, please?
[235:01.47]It's still lit.
[235:12.48]Get back up there.
[235:13.20]I have to jump from the cord to his tail for sure.
[235:20.32]Oh, candle, please.
[235:27.16]Yes, I love you.
[235:27.78]Yeah, I love you.
[235:28.56]Please don't do that.
[235:30.11]Can you fucking please grab the fucking cord?
[235:36.93]Grab the chain!
[235:37.77]Dear...
[235:40.99]God in fucking heaven, grab the chain.
[235:43.37]Alright, now do what you were doing again.
[235:55.13]Can you put your body up there again, buddy?
[235:57.98]I guess I just have to go over here.
[236:04.56]Can I make that jump?
[236:05.52]I think so.
[236:20.34]No, he should jump up on the beacon, right?
[236:23.14]If you were a smart dog, I would assume you'd be jumping on the beacon.
[236:27.10]Look at how smart you are.
[236:31.28]Careful.
[236:37.94]Okay.
[236:40.94]Kind of not close enough to grab his tail.
[236:42.98]Kind of hard to see.
[236:51.74]There you go.
[236:52.30]Okay, turn this way.
[236:54.34]Oh, very good, very good.
[236:55.50]Stay right there.
[236:56.12]Don't move his tail.
[236:58.70]If he had moved his tail, I would have been so pissed.
[237:06.57]Where'd you come from?
[237:20.63]Yeah, yeah, climb on the chain.
[237:23.56]Climb on the chain, he says.
[237:26.68]Climb the chain, he says.
[237:27.66]I would have loved to, if you didn't knock it out of the way for me.
[237:36.30]This time, when you get up there, can you stay up there for me for two seconds?
[237:42.24]Oh, dog of mine.
[237:49.72]This kid's got Spider-Man hands.
[237:50.92]He really does.
[237:52.74]Very agile.
[237:59.21]Alright.
[238:01.69]He turned around for me, too.
[238:02.93]And it was perfect.
[238:04.33]And then he decided to leave.
[238:06.31]Can I just tell him to sit?
[238:07.53]To stay?
[238:08.07]I wonder if I can just do that.
[238:15.50]Fuck!
[238:17.08]I was going for it.
[238:18.02]And it was a stupid move.
[238:21.39]I was hoping like I could catch him in the air and I could just climb on him.
[238:23.89]That was... I can't do it.
[238:27.01]Oh well.
[238:28.19]Don't worry, my bones will fucking heal.
[238:34.86]I just got impatient and I tried to skip it.
[238:40.68]God, come on.
[238:43.90]This is getting real stupid.
[238:52.87]Okay, seriously, why?
[238:55.47]Why?
[238:57.11]The chain.
[238:57.79]I know.
[238:58.73]I know the chain.
[238:59.51]I know I'm supposed to get the chain.
[239:01.11]But the game is having a little bit of trouble just determining what thing I'm supposed to be grabbing here.
[239:22.89]He looks like he's going for it.
[239:24.31]Are you gonna go for it?
[239:25.23]Can I please stop doing this?
[239:26.41]Can I just jump on him?
[239:28.03]No, I have to go over there for him to actually do it, don't I?
[239:30.87]Yeah.
[239:31.99]I mean, I have to do the tail.
[239:33.25]That's what it is.
[239:35.21]It's all about the tail.
[239:37.07]He just jumped off way too early.
[239:46.20]Why would they put all this here if it wasn't grabbing the tail?
[239:51.19]He's going to jump up.
[239:52.19]See, now he's getting himself into position.
[240:00.84]Really?
[240:03.88]Are you for real right now?
[240:10.82]Okay.
[240:11.56]Are you ready?
[240:13.71]Are you ready to do the thing that I want you to do?
[240:18.86]Yeah, he is.
[240:19.62]There he goes.
[240:20.22]Okay.
[240:20.88]He's done playing.
[240:21.80]He's done having fun.
[240:22.60]I just need to get up right there.
[240:27.12]Okay.
[240:29.34]Now turn around.
[240:34.03]Turn.
[240:35.41]Turn for me.
[240:37.63]Yeah.
[240:40.85]Alright.
[240:41.11]Now this time, if you could be so kind, don't jump off
[240:53.22]Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[240:57.40]Stay.
[240:57.72]See, this time you stayed.
[241:01.46]Why did you stay this time?
[241:03.74]I'm not entirely sure, but you did.
[241:08.20]Thank you for staying.
[241:13.18]Now what are you going to do?
[241:15.36]Huh?
[241:20.23]You're fine.
[241:23.30]If you went down there, I would have screamed.
[241:30.42]That's a long way down.
[241:31.48]Is that a bad guy?
[241:33.78]Everything that glows green in this game is a bad guy.
[241:38.58]Alright, globe or birdcage?
[241:39.66]Globe or birdcage?
[241:43.02]Globe or birdcage?
[241:44.56]Globe.
[241:46.99]That wasn't right!
[241:47.59]It wasn't right!
[241:48.15]It wasn't right!
[242:27.34]Thank God that checkpoint was where it was.
[242:29.28]Yeah.
[242:35.30]Oh, he's gonna be smelling on this thing?
[242:42.97]I love her!
[242:44.13]Please pull me.
[243:00.40]Just dropped the chain a little more.
[243:05.74]I guess maybe I can grab this now?
[243:08.11]Yeah.
[243:11.05]Where the hell do I bring this?
[243:14.13]I made a Winnie the Pooh joke earlier, but I'm going to do another one.
[243:18.21]This is one of those Winnie the Pooh pots of honey.
[243:19.98]There's the joke.
[243:20.56]There's the whole one.
[243:21.24]That's the whole joke.
[243:23.68]Add it to the count.
[243:31.83]I bet this is burning my face.
[243:38.85]It's a mega treat.
[243:41.83]Yeah, you want this mega treat?
[243:43.87]I'm gonna dump this pure concentrated super slurp down your throat.
[243:49.53]Come on.
[243:52.35]I think I can open these.
[243:53.08]Yeah.
[244:02.30]That opens that one.
[244:10.72]Now, what do I do with these?
[244:20.06]Do I want them to come up here, or do I want to just drop it down to them?
[244:26.95]Oh boy, look at him.
[244:27.65]He's just staring at me.
[244:33.07]I'm going to go this way.
[244:35.27]That's already been pulled.
[244:47.35]I know what you have to do.
[244:49.43]Don't even need to tell me.
[244:51.93]I know what I gotta do.
[244:52.93]I attach this to there and then he freaks out and then he pulls the chain and the door opens.
[245:01.29]Check it out.
[245:02.17]Watch me.
[245:11.87]You see?
[245:17.80]Mm-hmm.
[245:21.62]Here you go.
[245:24.76]Now open the door for us.
[245:29.15]Go get that super slurm.
[245:36.73]Yep.
[245:37.67]Aha!
[245:42.76]Pull it.
[245:46.56]Pull it.
[245:51.83]Pull it, man.
[245:52.41]There we go.
[245:54.63]Alright.
[245:55.85]That almost could have killed me.
[245:56.81]Alright, now how do I get him to... Oh, wait.
[246:00.43]Okay.
[246:00.79]There's a treat over here.
[246:04.47]Now can I get him to come in here with the treat?
[246:05.91]Okay.
[246:14.23]I'm going to put this down and take a look at what's going on here.
[246:17.05]We got this.
[246:19.53]We got the wheel barrel.
[246:30.95]Hold on.
[246:31.37]Are we playing mousetrap right now?
[246:38.55]Do I have to do like a series of things in a row?
[246:41.53]See, this is... I'm going to have to pull that, twist that.
[246:46.50]The mouse goes over here.
[246:47.30]He goes over the bathtub, flips the guy in.
[246:51.24]Oh, that's stuck in here.
[246:57.56]Uh...
[247:05.25]Maybe I can... Something else in here, right?
[247:18.19]Oh, there he goes.
[247:18.73]He's not interested in that anymore, it doesn't seem like.
[247:29.23]I'm just gonna roll this down to see what it does.
[247:33.05]I don't think I can push it now.
[247:36.78]Come on, push it.
[247:38.70]Well, it is stuck up here forever.
[247:55.33]I see the track here.
[247:56.39]Do I have to move this?
[247:58.91]And get that down there?
[247:59.83]Can I push it that way?
[248:05.44]I'd like to move it, I don't think I can move it anymore.
[248:08.29]Oh no, he's pulling on the thing again.
[248:18.13]Can I pull it that way?
[248:22.53]I don't think so.
[248:23.09]Maybe I can.
[248:29.21]Yeah, I can knock it off.
[248:43.58]Can I, like, wedge this into the door?
[248:46.94]Betcha I can.
[248:48.82]Alright, go pull that thing up.
[248:52.48]I want to put this in the door.
[249:00.32]You know what to do.
[249:08.99]Do it!
[249:17.29]How high does he open it?
[249:18.03]Does he open it high enough for me to wedge it like this?
[249:24.19]Okay, I gotta push the other lane.
[249:31.33]Oh, I guess, no, he does, he does, he does.
[249:32.49]Okay, no, he doesn't.
[249:36.31]I'm just gonna wedge it in there.
[249:37.27]Alright, I'm just gonna do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
[249:40.43]Come on, dog!
[249:42.65]Ha ha!
[249:44.69]Ha ha ha ha!
[249:47.45]Fuck you, game!
[249:48.47]Ha ha!
[249:51.67]In here, look what I got.
[249:52.83]I got a treat for you.
[250:03.44]Come on in.
[250:04.12]You can make it.
[250:05.08]It's safe.
[250:10.44]Come on.
[250:11.96]Go get it.
[250:13.74]There it goes.
[250:14.14]That's like your... Wait.
[250:18.74]Hold on.
[250:21.72]Maybe if I take this thing in there, he'll care again.
[250:25.44]Should I just leave this?
[250:26.04]I feel like this is going to be just trouble if I bring this any more further in here.
[250:31.44]Oh, there he goes.
[250:31.86]Okay, fine.
[250:32.72]I hope I don't have to bring that thing.
[250:36.76]Otherwise, it's going to be a pain in the ass to get him to come in here.
[250:40.70]Come here.
[250:43.48]He's gonna knock it up.
[250:44.46]No, no, no, no.
[250:45.08]Look, look, look, look, look, look.
[250:46.18]Trust me.
[250:46.80]Turn around.
[250:48.28]No, no, no.
[250:48.70]You don't want to do that.
[250:49.70]Look behind you.
[250:50.36]Behind you.
[250:51.56]I have one of these.
[250:53.88]Why is he staring?
[250:54.48]He's standing up like a prairie dog.
[250:55.67]Come over here.
[250:56.05]Quick.
[250:57.85]Behind you.
[250:58.35]There you go.
[251:00.23]Look.
[251:01.27]Oh, yeah.
[251:05.35]You want it?
[251:06.80]Get it.
[251:07.94]Three, two, one.
[251:09.06]Good catch.
[251:17.91]That should do it.
[251:18.57]We can now have him jump over here.
[251:20.19]Go that way, please, and jump.
[251:26.19]He's going back to the... I think he wants that stupid toy.
[251:34.86]The eyes...
[251:42.02]Alright, hopefully we can make it out of this temple.
[251:43.84]We've been in here for like fucking four hours.
[251:48.66]I guess I could say I'm getting kind of sick of the old ruined temple indoors.
[251:53.39]It was like beautiful outside.
[251:54.47]Let's do some shit outside.
[251:55.35]Come on, go.
[252:04.84]Wait.
[252:06.38]No, I told you to jump over the thing.
[252:10.32]No, you want that stupid fucking toy again.
[252:18.52]No.
[252:21.06]God damn it.
[252:22.24]I'm bringing it in there.
[252:23.54]No, you know what?
[252:24.06]We're fucking throwing this thing off a cliff.
[252:29.40]Come here.
[252:29.74]I'm putting this someplace where you won't even know it exists.
[252:37.72]Get it.
[252:40.97]Can I take it off?
[252:42.09]Why can't I grab it?
[252:45.33]Alright, you know what?
[252:49.29]Just... That way.
[252:54.25]Come on.
[252:55.25]I can't, like, pick it up.
[252:57.45]Go.
[252:59.77]Listen to me.
[253:03.92]You need to listen to me.
[253:09.59]I can't unhook the thing.
[253:11.24]It wouldn't work.
[253:18.72]He's completely locked in right now.
[253:23.37]Please, unhook it.
[253:25.11]No, he's supposed to ride it, of course.
[253:27.59]I thought it was holding square.
[253:31.93]Wasn't it?
[253:32.29]Didn't square unhook it and hook it?
[253:36.01]Oh, that just pushes it now.
[253:43.51]Get in the fucking door!
[253:46.99]Go!
[253:47.79]You listen to me.
[253:48.95]I'm your master.
[253:49.73]Don't forget about the stupid toy on the rope.
[253:52.16]Get in that door now.
[253:53.60]Hello?
[253:54.48]Hello?
[253:56.04]Hello?
[254:01.24]You were just being so good.
[254:06.02]Hey!
[254:13.55]In here!
[254:18.99]He's completely fucking locked in.
[254:20.91]Get over here!
[254:25.35]He's just... He's not moving.
[254:27.27]He's not gonna move.
[254:31.47]We are Dusa!
[254:36.97]So... I think we may have run into a problem.
[254:50.46]I think Trico might be broken.
[254:52.79]I think he's broken.
[254:53.95]I don't think he's with us anymore.
[255:04.74]Stop looking at this and I can't unhook the damn thing anymore Look look come here Hey
[255:29.94]And so, he lived on yelling at CatDog.
[255:33.45]Hey!
[255:35.13]Hello!
[255:38.53]Hey!
[255:39.33]Pick up the thing?
[255:44.35]I can't!
[255:46.34]I can't, like, unhook the thing anymore.
[255:47.76]Ah!
[255:51.74]Yeti-me!
[255:53.70]Yeti-me!
[255:55.20]Yeti-so!
[255:56.78]I can't!
[256:11.08]Goddammit, this thing is fucking just killing me.
[256:15.62]Why can't I unhook it?
[256:18.34]I'm clearly right here.
[256:22.89]This thing is kicking my ass more than the enemies in the game.
[256:30.29]I've taken more damage from the fucking honeypot than anything else in the game.
[256:46.50]Okay.
[256:53.88]Correct me if I'm wrong.
[256:54.85]It's holding square, right?
[256:57.19]That's what it said before.
[256:57.91]I don't even have an option to do it.
[257:03.08]And the circle doesn't do anything.
[257:05.00]I just grab the... Okay, no.
[257:08.19]No.
[257:13.85]He was in here before.
[257:17.83]He's just, like, completely stuck right there.
[257:19.20]Because he came in... You know why he came in here?
[257:20.62]Because I had the other tree.
[257:21.58]And, like, we're supposed to go up there.
[257:23.96]We're just supposed to jump up there, right?
[257:26.14]Like, that's... Look, we're, like, out.
[257:27.74]We're almost out.
[257:41.28]Just jump from place and restart.
[257:44.94]I'm going to try one thing here.
[257:46.08]Let me see.
[257:48.86]Hold shift then press square.
[257:50.34]I'm just going to move it around and see if I can get him to fucking calm himself down.
[258:00.89]I guess maybe I can just reload the checkpoint.
[258:14.99]Close the door and he will open it?
[258:16.15]I guess I could try to move the thing again.
[258:18.77]But then why would he come back in?
[258:27.08]But how far away is the checkpoint?
[258:28.32]That's what I'm fucking scared of.
[258:30.08]Oh, he's just in here.
[258:38.55]Okay, where are the checkpoints?
[258:41.66]No, and he's going to jump, isn't he?
[258:42.88]Don't even tell me that you, like, I reloaded the checkpoint and you're just instantly going to jump to the thing that I needed you to jump to.
[258:48.42]But you didn't even eat the treat.
[258:49.24]Alright, I've been having fun.
[258:53.71]Let's break it down for real.
[258:54.95]Let's be real here.
[258:55.59]That was pretty dumb.
[258:58.03]That was pretty dumb.
[259:00.61]That was pretty dumb.
[259:03.55]I'm going to be completely off.
[259:13.78]Alright, now we're fucking breaking the door.
[259:15.16]Alright, come here.
[259:19.97]Grab it.
[259:23.01]I don't have an option to grab this.
[259:24.35]Why do I not... I can't grab things anymore.
[259:27.19]Nope, I can't grab this.
[259:28.69]It's not happening.
[259:36.75]Close the door.
[259:37.25]I can't close the door?
[259:40.29]Alright, go for it.
[259:41.81]Jump.
[259:45.23]Jump!
[259:46.93]Jump!
[259:52.88]No, I... Please!
[259:56.64]Do what I tell you to.
[259:57.88]Forward, jump!
[260:01.02]Go!
[260:02.96]Forget about the toy.
[260:03.74]Oh, boy.
[260:09.62]Okay, you jumped.
[260:17.40]Alright, well there's two things here.
[260:18.64]Now he's gonna- don't- please don't turn around and run back to the fucking toy.
[260:22.35]Don't do it, don't do it.
[260:23.23]Please don't run back to the toy.
[260:24.23]If he goes back to the toy, I swear to god- Alright, so I gotta smash these things.
[260:52.99]Try not to break them.
[260:59.43]I'm thinking I can just smash them with my hands, but apparently not.
[261:02.09]What about over here?
[261:04.99]Nope.
[261:05.57]Oh, wait.
[261:05.91]What the hell was I doing?
[261:07.67]Maybe I can just you smash them.
[261:14.53]See that thing over there?
[261:15.19]Break it.
[261:17.37]You know you want to.
[261:18.01]Go get it.
[261:21.05]Destroy it.
[261:25.77]That thing?
[261:26.09]You know the thing you don't like?
[261:27.75]Break it!
[261:29.97]Yeah.
[261:34.27]I can't grab these either.
[261:35.17]Where are we going?
[261:35.67]No, why is it doing that?
[261:36.65]No, there's no way I can't grab it.
[261:39.07]I can push it.
[261:43.68]No.
[262:00.62]Grip what?
[262:01.06]What the hell is this?
[262:05.27]Is this a tweet?
[262:05.83]No, it's some guy's head.
[262:07.73]This is like a dude's helmet.
[262:30.87]Alright, dog.
[262:34.99]Are you ready?
[262:37.45]You feel better?
[262:39.83]Good.
[262:44.74]Now take us out of here.
[262:45.62]Get us out of this hellhole.
[262:46.56]You're not going to eat the guy's head, are you?
[262:51.46]You're not that crazy.
[262:54.04]Jump.
[262:56.58]What's the premise of this game?
[262:57.98]I don't think anybody has any idea.
[263:02.37]You're just a boy with this giant, colossal animal.
[263:06.66]And you don't know why you're here, and you don't know what you're doing.
[263:09.64]That's pretty much the whole thing.
[263:12.00]At this point.
[263:16.43]Uh, go that way.
[263:17.55]I can get up there, I think.
[263:23.19]Although, what's your problem?
[263:31.65]Should I just go?
[263:32.13]Go forward then.
[263:33.75]Go on, go forward.
[263:37.41]Then I can... Easy.
[263:48.32]And then the soldiers come out.
[263:51.76]Your car battery died today?
[263:53.10]That's not cool.
[263:55.42]Hopefully you weren't stuck somewhere for a while.
[263:58.43]Because that sucks.
[264:02.50]Hey guys, we made it out.
[264:04.98]We actually made it out of the temple again.
[264:08.99]That just brings us out here.
[264:16.03]I obviously need him to be out here.
[264:17.91]There's so many things to smash.
[264:21.38]All these dream catchers.
[264:25.68]Well.
[264:25.92]I don't think there's anything really over here.
[264:37.70]Or is there?
[264:38.08]Can I push this thing?
[264:39.30]No.
[264:45.68]Well, shit.
[264:48.52]Will you come out here?
[264:54.41]I swear to joke ratio.
[264:55.69]Yeah, it's messed up.
[264:58.21]Come on.
[264:59.69]Out here.
[265:00.73]I need to see where we can... We have to jump from thing to thing, obviously, but...
[265:08.25]Alright, come down here.
[265:14.59]Yet again.
[265:15.05]Yet again.
[265:16.23]We're okay.
[265:22.75]40 minutes.
[265:22.99]I'm extremely bad.
[265:24.16]Extremely bad at what?
[265:27.24]Knowing where everything is before I know where it is?
[265:40.42]Alright, obviously jump on that one.
[265:41.72]That's where you gotta go.
[265:50.78]Well, you didn't actually... You kinda missed.
[265:53.30]You missed it a little bit.
[265:54.06]You... Where... You are just taking me down here.
[265:58.51]Yeah, okay.
[265:59.37]I know.
[265:59.61]You wanna... I know.
[266:00.95]I know.
[266:01.09]I know.
[266:01.23]Hold on.
[266:01.43]Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[266:07.31]Don't worry.
[266:07.55]I can smash it.
[266:08.15]I'll smash it.
[266:10.55]I'll take care of it.
[266:15.32]This thing is protected.
[266:16.32]I don't think I can smash it with this.
[266:18.50]I could, like, knock it off.
[266:23.11]Eat shit!
[266:25.09]Nope, okay.
[266:41.00]Push it off.
[266:41.44]There we go.
[266:43.17]Shove it into the abyss.
[266:44.85]No, I didn't want to pick... Keep that here.
[266:47.39]I feel like I'm going to need it.
[266:48.59]I know I will.
[266:59.84]See you later.
[267:01.02]Bye.
[267:11.20]What a delayed reaction.
[267:22.87]That was so delayed.
[267:25.75]Oh my god.
[267:29.73]Does he really come over here now?
[267:33.45]Come on.
[267:38.33]Hey, come here, you.
[267:39.15]Come on.
[267:40.70]It's gone.
[267:41.12]The thing is gone.
[267:42.48]You're safe to come over here now.
[267:45.11]And then let me jump on you.
[267:53.43]He's still scared.
[267:55.71]Will you not come over here?
[267:58.97]I don't think I can climb back up there.
[268:09.36]There's no ladder.
[268:09.98]No, I can't even get it back up there, I don't think.
[268:11.66]It needs to come down here.
[268:12.80]Alright, go.
[268:16.81]Are you doing it?
[268:18.57]Go, jump.
[268:27.63]Yeah, here you go.
[268:29.41]Go.
[268:29.87]Go.
[268:32.49]He's gonna just rest.
[268:33.31]There he goes.
[268:35.21]Holy shit.
[268:38.39]Oh, it's gonna fall.
[268:42.11]Good fall.
[268:44.01]How do I get over there?
[268:46.11]Hey.
[268:47.41]Don't just leave me.
[268:50.29]Oh, for the love of fuck.
[268:51.57]This is not gonna go well.
[268:54.20]You trying to tell me that I need to jump and grab his fucking tail?
[268:59.02]Can you please just come back a little bit so I can jump to you?
[269:11.95]Oh.
[269:13.63]What is he trying to tell me?
[269:17.67]Who cares?
[269:18.23]Oh!
[269:21.49]Oh!
[269:22.15]Get me!
[269:22.88]Get me!
[269:26.88]Oh!
[269:27.36]Easy, easy.
[269:27.90]Don't rip the shirt.
[269:28.68]Don't rip the shirt.
[269:29.30]That was expensive.
[269:30.12]Alright, that was awesome.
[269:35.68]Alright, I gotta take out one more of these things.
[269:43.65]Alright, he's gonna hang out there.
[269:44.55]Cool.
[269:46.97]That was pretty fucking cool.
[269:48.91]And remember how I said earlier, like, that was dumb.
[269:50.75]Like, no, that was fucking cool.
[269:52.47]That was really cool.
[270:01.90]Like, I perfectly, perfectly almost just jumped in that fucking spot.
[270:06.02]Perfect.
[270:07.02]Like, it couldn't have gone any better.
[270:08.30]It's like I was trying to do that.
[270:11.15]I can assure you I wasn't.
[270:21.53]Yeah, it does sound like a ballad.
[270:22.63]I said T-Rex in the very beginning.
[270:27.36]Ow.
[270:33.58]Uh, sealer.
[270:37.56]Hey, look.
[270:39.52]It's safe for you.
[270:41.01]Oh, okay.
[270:41.39]Oh, I need to go.
[270:46.11]I gotta go now.
[270:46.79]I gotta go now.
[270:50.57]Trico?
[270:51.29]Trico?
[270:52.12]Trico?
[270:53.58]Trico, is it my save?
[270:56.68]I'm not safe.
[270:57.12]Trico!
[270:58.83]Trico!
[271:00.69]Trico!
[271:01.99]Trico!
[271:28.47]Alright, well, so what the hell do I need to do then?
[271:31.05]He needs to grab me, doesn't he?
[271:33.96]Like, from right here?
[271:34.58]Trico, over here now, quick.
[271:35.48]Come on, come on, come on.
[271:36.92]Over here.
[271:38.12]Right there.
[271:39.46]Right there.
[271:40.52]Right there, right there, right there.
[271:44.88]I don't know.
[271:45.26]I don't know.
[271:45.63]I don't know.
[271:49.31]Trico, you're not... Trico, you don't understand what's going on.
[271:51.35]Over here.
[271:51.61]Come on.
[271:56.79]Trico!
[271:57.99]Please!
[271:59.67]Right here!
[272:01.15]And come and save me.
[272:04.72]You gotta come save me.
[272:05.32]Trico, you have to save me.
[272:07.18]Trico, I'm gonna fall.
[272:08.30]Trico, I'm gonna die.
[272:09.38]Trico, I'm gonna die.
[272:10.06]Trico, I'm dead.
[272:20.07]Let's do it again.
[272:33.46]Can you just come get me now?
[272:35.37]Just come and get me right now.
[272:37.36]I know what's going to happen.
[272:38.24]Just come and get me.
[272:41.21]Right here.
[272:41.91]Set up right here.
[272:43.25]Okay, you got time.
[272:44.91]Okay, he's gonna say, come here, baby.
[272:47.15]Come on, do it.
[272:47.63]Say, baby.
[272:48.73]Okay, you ready?
[272:50.27]Okay, he's gotta be ready, right?
[272:51.94]He's ready.
[272:54.44]Get me!
[272:55.02]He's gonna miss.
[272:57.30]He fucking missed.
[272:59.10]He missed.
[273:00.22]He's missing.
[273:01.74]He's missing.
[273:05.16]He's missing.
[273:06.20]Oh, I'm gonna get the tail!
[273:07.87]Oh!
[273:11.67]Okay, I think I remember seeing this.
[273:16.23]Yeah, I know, now I understand.
[273:20.45]Here we go.
[273:20.79]Holy shit.
[273:26.72]Oh, now that's what I call cinematic.
[273:31.96]Don't fall.
[273:32.82]Uh-huh, you okay?
[273:36.29]Come on, you can do it.
[273:41.71]One more.
[273:43.33]What happened to the E3 event?
[273:46.79]What happened to the video?
[273:48.49]What happened to the E3 video?
[273:51.67]In the E3 video, what happened?
[273:54.03]Move this?
[273:54.47]Pick this up?
[273:59.82]No.
[274:01.34]Shit!
[274:04.64]Shit!
[274:05.08]No, I gotta move this.
[274:07.16]Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[274:09.76]You're good.
[274:17.29]The Last Guardian.
[274:18.23]It's a little itchy after that one, a little bit.
[274:53.34]Oh, that's sick.
[274:55.86]Oh, okay.
[274:56.80]Oh, good job, Trigo.
[274:58.40]You shook a little too hard.
[274:59.40]And the stream ends.
[275:00.14]No, no, no, no.
[275:02.45]You gotta get a little bit further.
[275:08.47]Oh, alright.
[275:12.42]Give me a second here.
[275:16.23]Thank you, uh, thank you, Black Spruce, for one month.
[275:18.93]No, thank you, Black Spruce.
[275:21.17]Thank you, Black Spruce.
[275:22.43]Thank you, Spruce One, for ten months.
[275:24.23]Not one month.
[275:24.97]Uh, I'm Tony, and I loves you.
[275:28.28]Well, thanks a lot, Spruce.
[275:30.80]Leasty Five, thanks for the sub.
[275:32.20]Quick, quack, quack, quack of dawn for two months.
[275:35.96]Uh, Adidas Footwear, thanks for the two months.
[275:37.42]The Mighty Lemon Lord.
[275:39.74]all the time for three months thanks a lot new subs and old subs for a long time and then never trust a purple with a thousand bits 10 bucks hi there I'm Jerma and I'm incapable of learning from basic mistakes what's your name uh my name's Jerma but thanks for the 10 bucks dude appreciate it
[276:03.57]Alright.
[276:04.19]Thanks a lot, guys.
[276:05.07]Thanks for the bits.
[276:06.49]You're pushing me in a place where I'm not supposed to be pushing.
[276:08.86]I don't even know where the hell I am.
[276:12.92]It's a real shame that The Last Guardian stuck with protecting Jerma of all the clowns.
[276:17.96]Come on.
[276:18.36]I'm not a clown.
[276:21.77]Maybe I am a clown, but I'm not in any makeup, so I can't be technically named a clown.
[276:27.51]Alright, we beat the game.
[276:29.25]This is the end of the game.
[276:29.95]We're going to come down here.
[276:30.55]We're going to find the secret dial of... Okay, no more jokes.
[276:34.81]I need to figure this out.
[276:37.55]Already, people.
[276:38.25]Suck on the ball.
[276:41.76]Trico, you need to do some stuff in there, please.
[276:44.26]If you could, my friend.
[276:49.56]Oh, shit.
[276:50.26]He's not going to be able to because the thing's in there.
[276:51.87]The eyeball symbol.
[276:57.26]Are they casting spells?
[276:59.72]What?
[277:00.64]Name?
[277:01.12]God, he can't move.
[277:01.92]I gotta... Stop it, shake him off, shake him off.
[277:09.47]Whatever, it's a dumb... I mean, the camera's in such a bad spot, I can't even see what's going on.
[277:17.93]Look at all these fucking things.
[277:24.77]He's talking about Dark Souls.
[277:25.73]These guys are casting sorceries.
[277:31.70]Fuck, I... Like I said, I see where I gotta go.
[277:33.86]Get up there!
[277:34.36]Come on before he grabs you!
[277:38.68]Please.
[277:43.27]What is that?
[277:44.57]I don't know.
[277:45.03]A grip?
[277:46.89]What is this?
[277:49.75]Is this Home Alone?
[277:51.99]I think we're gonna do some Home Alone shit here.
[277:54.51]I gotta like smash him with that, right?
[277:58.72]Maybe not.
[277:59.34]I gotta smash that with that.
[278:02.71]Let's go over the question of how to get that to go over here.
[278:06.99]How far can I make this move?
[278:16.44]No, not that far.
[278:19.00]Let's climb it first.
[278:24.26]Oh, alright.
[278:25.12]Okay, I get it.
[278:26.02]Keep moving it.
[278:27.82]I just gotta push it first and then get on it.
[278:30.74]Fuck!
[278:31.40]Stop casting stupid spells at me.
[278:36.07]Dick.
[278:38.01]No!
[278:40.55]Alright, here we go.
[278:45.51]No, we're not going.
[278:49.31]Don't break your bones.
[278:54.87]I gotta get it all the way back, and then we gotta go like this, and then get on it!
[279:00.79]Come here!
[279:06.79]I wish these guys would get the fuck away from me.
[279:13.36]Yeah, I know, I know, but for some reason I can't get you to move.
[279:23.75]Yeah, I examined the chain with great interest.
[279:27.35]I knew I had to push the fucking thing forward so it would move on the dial.
[279:32.19]But I forgot.
[279:32.76]That, like, it... Apparently, it moved this time.
[279:38.92]And I wasn't able to grab it in time.
[279:41.36]But it's okay.
[279:42.64]Because it'll come back eventually.
[279:43.88]Oh, fuck.
[279:55.81]I knew that if I waited it would do it again, and this time I could actually grab it.
[280:04.50]Go.
[280:07.74]Go.
[280:13.40]Go.
[280:18.03]I did some thinking and I realized that I had to actually push it again.
[280:22.38]Because I came back with the same force that I pushed it with the first time, but I have to do it a second time.
[280:34.93]Why is it not, like, move and go?
[280:38.75]Okay, yeah, I need help here to understand what the fuck this is doing this for.
[280:45.89]Like, why did it go that first time?
[280:49.54]I'm very clearly, I just did the exact same fucking thing I did last time.
[280:56.99]Like... Jesus.
[281:01.37]Yeah, I examined the chain with great interest, and I pushed it.
[281:05.72]And I ran with it, and I'm fucking pushing it right now.
[281:08.04]But then it just stops!
[281:10.40]Oh my god!
[281:11.40]Come here, you piece of shit!
[281:14.46]Keep going.
[281:25.39]Drag it!
[281:28.45]Oh my god, please.
[281:29.45]Why does it have to stop?
[281:30.65]Stop, stop letting go of it!
[281:31.89]Stay on it!
[281:35.04]Come on!
[281:35.72]Alright, jump.
[281:44.24]Jump off!
[281:46.68]Alright, dump the fucking thing.
[281:55.13]Alright, get in here, dog.
[281:57.98]Alright, a couple things I didn't understand right there.
[281:59.98]Here's the first thing I didn't understand.
[282:02.64]I don't think the game ever told me that holding circle will make me hold onto an object or ever even hang it.
[282:10.67]Triangle is the only thing I've known to jump and, like, grab something.
[282:13.39]I didn't know that holding circle actually, like, will keep me gripped on holding onto, like, a hanging object like that.
[282:22.06]That's the first time I was able to actually, like, hold circle on an object.
[282:33.68]Get him!
[282:53.24]Yay, you did it.
[282:55.20]Can you guys name one time in the whole game where I've had to hold circle on an object to stay on it?
[283:06.23]Not one time.
[283:10.75]It's always been like it automatically grabs it when you jump on it.
[283:15.88]Like right now, I'm not holding circle.
[283:17.56]I've never had to do that.
[283:20.28]Now I know you can do that.
[283:21.14]There's never an option for me to have to know to do that.
[283:24.14]Are you going to go over there?
[283:27.70]Which way are you going to go?
[283:30.94]What are you doing?
[283:33.78]He likes to do this sometimes.
[283:34.74]He likes to get his head stuck on stuff.
[283:37.03]Okay.
[283:46.20]Do you expect chat to take my side?
[283:47.63]I never expect chat to take my side.
[283:54.45]Only in certain situations, I guess.
[283:56.01]I don't know what's in this room.
[284:11.37]I guess we just have to go through there.
[284:14.98]That would make sense, right?
[284:21.09]Will he jump up this?
[284:23.71]No, I gotta jump over there.
[284:24.92]He'll probably follow me up.
[284:25.92]Come here, you.
[284:30.94]I'll always be against you.
[284:43.61]When you pulled the spear out.
[284:45.03]Well, yeah, but, like, that was me... Like, I had to hold circle and then press, like, the directional buttons.
[284:50.68]And I was, like, standing completely still.
[284:53.38]Can you go over there for me, please?
[284:55.14]Go.
[284:58.04]I need to push that again and get back up there.
[285:01.24]This is PS4 only, though.
[285:08.58]Well... Oh, shit.
[285:09.54]Okay.
[285:10.50]Well, he doesn't want to get up there.
[285:12.77]Can I make it from here?
[285:15.59]No, you must do something else.
[285:17.10]Alright, well, come over here.
[285:19.68]That's better.
[285:20.06]That's probably a better idea.
[285:26.00]Oh, this is going to be tricky.
[285:27.06]Oh, you actually want to go there, don't you?
[285:33.40]You got it?
[285:35.94]Just do it slow.
[285:41.42]I beat Mario.
[285:42.60]Yeah, guys, I beat Mario Brothers.
[285:44.06]Come on.
[285:51.66]Is he going to follow me?
[285:52.38]I don't think he... Oh, boy.
[285:54.84]We are down to like seven frames a second right now.
[285:57.50]Holy shit.
[285:59.60]That was not good.
[286:00.76]Is that a lever to pull?
[286:07.94]Let's get it.
[286:22.97]Alright, you can come in now.
[286:36.12]Let's go.
[286:37.86]Save the frames.
[286:41.60]I had to hold down circle to pull that.
[286:43.24]Did you guys know I contradict myself when I fucking get angry at games?
[286:52.05]Alright, almost done with this.
[286:55.91]This kid looks hard to control.
[286:57.03]It is.
[286:58.81]But... Okay.
[287:07.67]It is fairly difficult to control.
[287:10.04]But I haven't had that much of a problem with it.
[287:14.78]It hasn't been, you know, like, unbearable.
[287:20.26]It just can be a little sloppy in some places.
[287:26.14]Can I get you to move over here?
[287:39.43]Can you grab that for me?
[287:46.98]They're not great, but they're not necessarily bad.
[287:52.88]I guess if you played Shadow of the Colossus, then you... Ooh, you get a treat.
[287:55.70]Come here.
[287:56.37]Two treats.
[287:59.57]It has a very similar vibe that Shadow of the Colossus had.
[288:04.85]The frame rate is pretty terrible.
[288:08.49]You ready?
[288:08.79]Here you go.
[288:10.45]You want to eat it in my hands or what?
[288:15.30]Catch it.
[288:15.60]No.
[288:17.26]Oh, you got it.
[288:18.06]No, you got it.
[288:24.45]How is the frame rate this terrible?
[288:26.28]Well, the only thing I can think of is that because this game was in development hell for like eight or nine years, I'm sure they had to change hardware a bunch of times and that's probably not easy to port what may have potentially been a PlayStation 2 or 3 game to redo it again and put it on PS4.
[288:49.85]I'm not sure.
[288:50.59]I'm not a doctor.
[288:51.95]I don't know.
[288:56.83]Pray for me.
[288:59.17]Good thing I got enough prayers.
[289:00.29]Thanks, guys.
[289:06.19]Shout out to the Colossus.
[289:10.27]Had bad frame rate.
[289:12.27]Yeah.
[289:14.88]Pray for me.
[289:16.68]I didn't get enough prayers yesterday.
[289:17.68]Oh, shit.
[289:28.83]I'm gonna try to give you guys truthful statement here Trying to do this at like nine frames a second is really not the easiest thing in the world to do I'm completely honest Should I- no I gotta jump from there.
[289:48.62]That's too- that's not gonna get it.
[289:51.12]Just enough prayers, just enough
[289:59.05]Damn, okay.
[290:02.80]Excuses.
[290:03.40]Yeah, you could call that an excuse, but I feel like it's a pretty valid one.
[290:14.42]Over there now?
[290:20.17]Where's the eyeball thing?
[290:23.57]There it is, okay.
[290:32.09]Alright.
[290:34.10]Now, do I jump for the chain or do I jump for the board?
[290:36.66]It's gonna be kind of far away.
[290:41.10]Mommy!
[290:43.32]Mommy!
[290:49.96]It's okay.
[290:51.58]I'm okay.
[290:56.10]This is stressing me out.
[290:57.58]That was pretty stressful.
[290:59.47]Whoa, I was looking at chat, I was ran off.
[291:01.33]Can I grab this from here?
[291:02.39]Okay, no, fuck.
[291:08.25]I have to do this.
[291:09.57]Oh no, this is gonna be horrible.
[291:12.79]I gotta see-saw the thing.
[291:14.39]Here we go.
[291:19.27]See-saw.
[291:20.77]See-saw!
[291:24.13]Oh!
[291:27.64]This reminds me of another game, but I can't put my finger on it.
[291:34.85]Maybe like, um, Heart of Darkness?
[291:36.57]Do you have to play Heart of Darkness for PS1?
[291:38.03]What the fuck would I do here?
[291:47.31]Uh...
[291:58.40]Okay.
[292:01.00]Can I just smash it with my hands?
[292:02.16]No.
[292:02.30]Can I push it from the other side?
[292:14.90]Um, hold on.
[292:17.34]I guess maybe the weight on here will make it fall.
[292:19.70]It'll slide off.
[292:20.76]Hopefully that's what we're doing.
[292:23.26]Right?
[292:23.50]If I hang on it for long enough, won't it just kind of pulse out now?
[292:31.72]Or not?
[292:32.46]No.
[292:33.14]Why is it letting me do this, though?
[292:42.28]Other side?
[292:48.20]Can I grab this thing?
[292:50.63]And smash it into it?
[292:52.77]Looks like maybe it's possible.
[292:59.51]Can I stand on this?
[293:01.01]No, I don't think so.
[293:06.73]Climb on top of this, maybe?
[293:09.41]Yeah, okay, this thing's on it.
[293:10.57]It's locked.
[293:17.10]Keep going.
[293:23.30]What?!
[293:25.04]What?! !
[293:28.64]Why did you do that?
[293:50.23]What the fuck was that?
[293:51.47]What the fuck was that?
[293:54.29]Okay.
[293:54.45]Okay.
[293:54.97]I was doing what I thought I was supposed to do.
[294:18.14]That gave me a heart attack too.
[294:19.46]I did not think I was going to go through a solid object.
[294:25.38]Apparently we did.
[294:29.05]Wait, no, wait a second!
[294:36.51]There's a hole in the glass.
[294:40.23]There's a hole in the fucking glass.
[294:56.83]there just to fuck with you I'm certain of it so do I Jesus okay that's that's funny because now what we have to do is we have to get we have to climb up because on the other side right
[295:27.29]No?
[295:27.53]Okay, be easy here.
[295:30.77]I'm assuming I have to get through this middle, right?
[295:41.64]Does that make any sense to anybody?
[295:42.94]Is this making any sense to anybody?
[295:46.86]Um...
[296:01.02]I guess, but... Okay, there's another hole.
[296:05.63]There's another hole to jump into.
[296:13.09]And that should bring us to the top.
[296:18.71]There we are.
[296:20.32]Very slowly hang back down here.
[296:27.00]Hang down.
[296:27.58]I know you're very capable of doing it.
[296:31.26]You're very capable of hanging down.
[296:32.72]I've seen you do it a hundred times.
[296:35.14]There we are.
[296:40.83]That brings us to the top.
[296:44.45]Alright, now... Ugh.
[296:47.75]Ugh, God.
[296:50.81]Ugh, God.
[296:51.55]Huh?
[296:54.79]Huh?
[296:55.21]I gotta, like, smash it with the globe?
[296:58.74]Do I have to go all the way up and climb all the way down?
[297:04.71]No, fuck that.
[297:05.41]We're doing it faster than that.
[297:08.19]Okay.
[297:09.57]Say your prayers.
[297:10.15]I don't know.
[297:19.77]Obviously, we have to swing it around and have it just get smashed, right?
[297:24.70]Time for a pendulum.
[297:27.54]Can I just...
[297:31.56]Let me see if I can just make it influence it a little bit.
[297:43.17]What is he doing?
[297:45.29]Come on, push it!
[297:47.57]Come on!
[297:52.76]I have to, like, climb it and move it around.
[297:56.34]But I am a fucking moron.
[297:58.54]Um, you think I'm gonna be able to figure this shit out right now?
[298:11.23]I'm assuming I gotta go pull on that chain.
[298:13.99]The counterweight.
[298:15.21]I didn't take physics.
[298:19.15]I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing here.
[298:20.47]Looks like it's getting closer, though.
[298:28.21]Yeah, where's Trico?
[298:29.77]Trico?
[298:32.58]He's gone.
[298:33.72]He's not with me right now.
[298:34.68]Oh, I heard him.
[298:41.78]this is seriously oh I don't like being up this high I don't have like a fear of heights anything but it's seriously stressing me out being this high they told you I was stressed out fuck god damn it he's just he just fucking slipped off please put me right back there oh son of a
[299:15.67]God damn it.
[299:24.09]Let's do it again.
[299:27.15]I'm not doing it like that again.
[299:39.86]I'm not gonna do it like that again.
[299:42.38]Jeez.
[299:46.87]Jesus.
[299:48.35]I need more coffee.
[299:49.09]I don't think I need more coffee.
[299:50.19]I think I need less coffee.
[299:51.29]I need to just get on that one and hold on to it.
[299:56.03]That was the goal, but then I turned into like a butter boy, and it didn't happen.
[300:02.21]See if I can pull that chain.
[300:05.65]Please don't fall off again.
[300:06.81]Come on, get your rack together.
[300:16.19]It's not that hard.
[300:17.67]Although you would never do something like this in real life.
[300:20.61]Okay, last time... Why is he hanging like that?
[300:24.13]Why are you hanging like this?
[300:25.91]This is what happened last time.
[300:27.53]What are you doing?
[300:30.71]I'm going for a jump.
[300:32.15]Because I know I'll fall, but I'm going for a jump this way.
[300:34.11]I'm going to turn, and we're going to line it up perfectly.
[300:37.05]And I'm just going to hit triangle.
[300:38.61]Although it's moving.
[300:39.25]Triangle.
[300:40.49]No, okay, we have to hit forward and triangle.
[300:42.06]Remember, you actually have forward momentum here.
[300:47.30]Holy shit.
[300:48.94]Holy shit.
[300:50.34]Holy shit.
[300:50.98]Holy shit.
[300:51.80]Rip it, please.
[301:09.29]I'm moving it around.
[301:16.87]Doesn't seem to be really doing a whole lot.
[301:23.55]Maybe the other side?
[301:24.57]I don't know.
[301:28.33]Forward, back.
[301:29.88]I'm gonna try the forward, back strategy.
[301:36.88]Uh.
[301:38.88]I'm just kind of bobbing around, huh?
[301:40.70]Okay.
[301:44.42]Okay.
[301:49.67]We're going back up.
[301:54.46]We're going to fall.
[301:55.58]One of those two things is going to happen.
[302:00.24]Grip it.
[302:01.68]Grip it.
[302:03.58]Grab that.
[302:04.30]Can you grab that?
[302:05.04]I don't think I can grab it.
[302:05.88]I'm going to have to jump again.
[302:15.43]Some pretty clutch grabs, if I do say so myself.
[302:22.21]Okay, we're almost at the very top, though.
[302:35.72]Uh... Don't... Please don't change the camera like that on me.
[302:43.94]Just drag it through, right?
[302:45.93]Pull it.
[302:51.50]Easy.
[302:58.29]Go, move it.
[303:00.09]So wait, I didn't even have to do that?
[303:02.87]Okay, seriously, you guys were talking about chess and checkers.
[303:07.84]I just had to play checkers, and I'm trying to play chess.
[303:12.56]Will he come up right now?
[303:20.34]He's not actually going to jump on this, is he?
[303:21.90]You're going to cause a lot of pro- Don't cause that many problems, please.
[303:29.66]We're going for it.
[303:32.34]Woohoo!
[303:32.90]Woohoo!
[303:34.07]Woo!
[303:35.63]Alright.
[303:41.05]Now where do we go?
[303:42.79]Over there?
[303:44.13]Alright, that way, dog.
[303:46.43]That way.
[303:49.90]Take us further.
[303:54.78]We must continue.
[303:55.58]There you go.
[304:00.04]You got it.
[304:00.40]And do it again.
[304:09.23]Two hands, kid.
[304:10.11]Two hands, please.
[304:13.41]And one more.
[304:20.67]There's a broken eyeglass thing over there.
[304:26.11]You are such a good dog.
[304:27.27]You did that perfectly without any trouble at all.
[304:33.18]Jesus, what the fuck am I thinking?
[304:37.40]I'm just trying to skip that as fast as I can.
[304:40.64]Don't ask me why.
[304:43.23]Throw this off.
[304:43.71]We don't even need that.
[304:46.13]It's going to push the damn thing.
[304:53.63]Keep going.
[304:57.78]See ya.
[305:01.76]It's safe.
[305:06.26]Hello.
[305:11.67]This is not safe.
[305:13.05]You gotta keep going, dog.
[305:19.03]Am I on him?
[305:36.83]Yikes Do one more jump for me boy, come on good dog one more jump He's gonna get over there
[305:49.92]You can do it.
[305:51.12]Just jump and pull the bridge down?
[305:53.64]I don't know.
[305:54.10]Hold on.
[305:57.24]Is there a way I can go down that way?
[305:59.70]Is this gonna happen?
[306:01.84]I'm gonna have to go for it.
[306:09.51]Oh, wait a minute.
[306:11.75]Do I have to tightrope walk this ship?
[306:15.59]I think I might have to tightrope walk.
[306:19.75]Oh, gosh darn it.
[306:20.91]Oh, gosh darn it.
[306:22.01]Because he's not going to jump.
[306:24.19]He's not going to jump, too.
[306:25.59]What, is he crazy?
[306:31.61]Yeah, okay.
[306:32.23]Come back this way, Troiko.
[306:35.75]Oh, wait a minute.
[306:38.52]I can see down there.
[306:43.48]Where am I?
[306:44.00]Please.
[306:48.08]Why can I climb down there?
[307:11.10]Alright.
[307:12.32]Let's get a good look.
[307:14.04]I don't think, um... Maybe I wasn't supposed to do that.
[307:22.07]Okay, I'm kind of screwed now.
[307:32.54]Fully intended.
[307:33.28]Yeah, that was intended.
[307:34.28]That was by design.
[307:40.18]Is there something that I can grab over here?
[307:42.20]Yeah, there is.
[307:42.70]Okay.
[307:46.04]Isn't it past my bedtime?
[307:47.10]No.
[307:48.20]I told you we were going for a while.
[307:54.40]Don't be an idiot.
[307:58.61]Crawl in the hole.
[308:00.01]I feel like I have to tightrope walk.
[308:02.93]Why would I put all this shit here for me?
[308:07.76]There's a lot of random shit here.
[308:09.08]And there is a... Yeah, there is a tightrope walk that we're gonna do.
[308:11.60]Yeah, dog.
[308:17.55]I... What is... What is this doing?
[308:20.09]Oh, it's like a cutscene.
[308:22.31]Alright.
[308:28.52]Hey, I found the right way to go.
[308:29.50]Oh, boy.
[308:39.22]I wish I could just tightrope walk, but no.
[308:41.04]We're gonna have to just go this way.
[308:43.82]The intended route, apparently.
[308:45.96]Anybody want coffee in here?
[308:51.94]I do.
[308:53.41]Let me take a second here.

[309:37.36]Let's get back to it.
[309:43.02]Oh, no.
[309:50.80]Don't even look up.
[309:53.09]The more you look, the more that you're going to get caught.
[309:54.85]Already caught.
[310:20.74]He just got played, motherfucker.
[310:26.03]Ah!
[310:27.51]Huh?
[310:28.71]Huh?
[310:32.53]How do I get through this gate?
[310:33.51]I'm pushing him off the cliff.
[310:41.95]I can't go that way, I don't think.
[310:43.17]I'm gonna go down.
[310:43.65]See if I can run this guy off the cliff.
[310:49.20]Never mind.
[310:52.44]I figured it out.
[310:55.64]He can't jump, can he?
[310:59.42]There it is.
[311:02.99]I played myself.
[311:05.29]Kind of did.
[311:05.77]Nothing else in here, right?
[311:09.79]No.
[311:12.00]Hey!
[311:12.18]Hey!
[311:15.68]It's gonna be impossible, yeah.
[311:16.64]I gotta, like... Oh, what a moron.
[311:21.32]He, like, let me... He sidestepped the wrong way.
[311:23.60]Thanks a lot, you dummy.
[311:30.33]Oh.
[311:31.25]Oh my god.
[311:35.49]Trico!
[311:35.75]I thought I could hang there and hide, like, fucking Hitman or something.
[311:42.43]It's alright.
[311:42.75]You just have to mash every button and you'll be fine.
[311:55.12]What?
[311:55.46]What?
[311:55.76]What do I do?
[311:57.97]Oh.
[312:02.75]Going up, up, up, up, up, I think.
[312:04.39]Is there another thing?
[312:06.09]I think this is probably another thing to pull, right?
[312:08.51]Oh, damn it.
[312:10.19]It's still going up.
[312:15.86]I don't even know where it is.
[312:16.60]Yeah, it's up.
[312:19.10]How do you lose?
[312:20.58]I have no idea.
[312:21.66]Maybe you can get grabbed away?
[312:24.61]He's gonna cast his stupid fucking spells at me, isn't he?
[312:26.87]No, he's not in here.
[312:38.80]I just, like, Scooby-Doo'd that guy.
[312:41.04]Alright, Trico?
[312:42.89]Trico?
[312:45.97]I think I gotta go this way.
[312:47.83]I hope I gotta go this way.
[312:52.51]No, the frames!
[312:54.59]The frames are killing me.
[312:56.95]You are killing me with these frames right now.
[312:59.83]I'm watching a slideshow.
[313:00.97]This is such a bad place to be.
[313:04.49]Oh, shit!
[313:05.67]This way.
[313:10.38]Where's Draco during this whole thing?
[313:11.70]This is gonna break, isn't it?
[313:14.76]They're all gonna start breaking.
[313:20.76]I'm gonna have to give me like a half second to do what I want to do.
[313:31.09]Of course it would be the shortcut one.
[313:32.37]This one's gonna fall.
[313:33.03]Because this is the one they know you're gonna take.
[313:34.69]Because then you want to cut across, right?
[313:38.13]Can I make this jump?
[313:39.59]Can I make this jump?
[313:40.27]I guess I can.
[313:46.66]Don't even fucking tell me.
[313:48.66]Don't even tell me.
[313:50.36]Don't even tell me.
[313:50.92]I gotta jump right now.
[313:51.58]I gotta go.
[313:53.66]What?
[313:53.90]What do I do?
[313:54.38]Huh?
[313:56.12]Hello?
[314:05.31]Can I jump off?
[314:07.59]Get us in there.
[314:11.57]Oh, he's got spears in him.
[314:22.77]Bastards!
[314:26.03]I got it.
[314:26.39]Don't worry.
[314:26.71]I got it.
[314:26.99]I got it.
[314:27.23]There's one.
[314:29.85]There's two.
[314:35.38]Come on.
[314:35.74]There's one more.
[314:36.46]I think he has one on his neck, too.
[314:37.76]One more.
[314:41.96]Alright.
[314:42.28]Are you good?
[314:43.80]Are you still hurting?
[314:45.30]Where's the other one?
[314:46.72]Up here?
[314:47.68]Yeah, there it is.
[314:52.56]Oh, I don't have it.
[314:53.94]He's moving around too much.
[314:55.56]There you go.
[314:56.16]Got it.
[314:58.62]Get out!
[315:00.52]Alright, get us in there.
[315:02.18]Quickly.
[315:02.82]You still hurt?
[315:06.53]Is there still one more?
[315:07.53]Did I miss one more?
[315:13.79]I don't know.
[315:14.67]I don't see any other ones.
[315:16.25]Do you want to get his face?
[315:20.93]His head?
[315:21.73]He's kind of crushing me right now.
[315:30.03]Maybe I just have to jump and let him... Oh, no.
[315:34.58]Okay, I see what's going on.
[315:37.30]I see what's going on.
[315:43.90]Stop moving around so much He's gonna get across oh my god, please let me just just get off I don't even know where I am I'm trying to get on his head.
[315:59.34]I'm trying to jump over I can't I keep falling down.
[316:03.83]Okay.
[316:04.63]I'm holding up right now Oh shit
[316:22.41]Where is it?
[316:28.95]Where is it?
[316:31.01]Go!
[316:31.35]Get it!
[316:31.63]There it is!
[316:34.09]Hold on to it!
[316:34.79]You fucking idiot!
[316:39.91]He's fine, he's fine, he's good, we're good.
[316:45.40]He's good.
[316:50.81]I just couldn't get like over his head this is still chugging so hard to
[317:17.60]The people that you're watching that have good framerates might be on a PS4 Pro.
[317:21.45]Because there are no issues at all on a PS4 Pro.
[317:24.43]PlayStation 4, the regular PlayStation 4 has massive framerate issues with this game.
[317:33.52]To a point that's almost... The word I want to use is ridiculous.
[317:39.46]This is ridiculous.
[317:43.35]I mean, I am on a not that old of a PS4.
[317:48.97]This is a... I mean, not the newest generation of PS4, but it is... This is running like shit for the last, like, hour.
[318:01.28]Um... Can I just push it out?
[318:11.58]Hold on.
[318:14.97]I think the word you're looking for is unplayable.
[318:26.00]Oh, he's hungry.
[318:29.00]Jesus.
[318:31.78]Boy.
[318:32.88]This is fucking crazy.
[318:34.92]It's like slow motion.
[318:37.49]This can't be more than 10 frames a second, what I'm seeing right now.
[318:41.79]It's severely affecting my immersion.
[318:46.28]Um, okay.
[318:46.98]Well... I guess just slip by here and see if I can get him something to eat.
[319:03.56]I almost want to, like, restart the game.
[319:05.40]Because... Jesus.
[319:11.40]That's all the motion blur.
[319:26.72]I don't think I can pull this or push this.
[319:28.04]Maybe I can.
[319:28.50]I guess I can.
[319:29.76]Eye candy 20 frames.
[319:33.63]This ain't even 20 frames.
[319:34.33]I can run over him.
[319:37.47]I feel like this is going to break.
[319:50.02]No, maybe not.
[319:50.42]There we go.
[319:57.76]Let's get this open.
[320:04.04]You want to come in?
[320:05.92]Oh, no, I don't think you do.
[320:09.22]He wants food.
[320:09.84]I need to bring him food first.
[320:13.87]Buy some frames from the PlayStation Store.
[320:16.41]If that were possible, I would.
[320:19.25]I guess you can.
[320:19.83]You just need to buy a PS4 Pro.
[320:23.07]Like, look at that.
[320:23.63]Boy!
[320:33.32]yeah alright hold on I'm going to let me like restart the game cause this is this is real bad it's gotten worse so maybe I can like restart the game and it'll help her a little bit maybe give me one second cause it is running like absolute dog shit
[321:04.18]Restart.
[321:04.76]I'm going to make sure my checkpoint's not that far away.
[321:07.74]Hopefully it's like right here.
[321:08.63]I'm just going to restart it.
[321:17.35]Take the disk out.
[321:21.46]Hopefully it saved in the right spot.
[321:24.16]Alright, I'm restarting it.
[321:30.16]It's console overheating.
[321:31.22]I don't think, I've played plenty of other games on this thing for more than five or six hours straight and it's been perfectly fine.
[321:40.09]Let's see if it'll load up.
[321:47.42]It's running the PS4 on its limits.
[321:50.89]yeah it was going alright for like the first couple hours and then more recently it's been down to sometimes like five to ten frames a second which in a game where you have to jump around and grab things you know not necessarily the greatest thing in the world okay let's switch it back and see if that helped
[322:21.28]I hope.
[322:29.83]No face cam?
[322:30.35]No, no face cam.
[322:32.77]I feel like you looking at my face in a cinematic experience like this.
[322:37.86]The dog jumped up and grabbed by the tail and flew through the window.
[322:41.60]And I'm just sitting there like, wow, that was cool.
[322:44.04]My face is on the screen.
[322:45.26]No, we're going to get a full fucking cinematic experience.
[322:56.99]I think this is loading.
[323:02.60]God, it would be a shame if my save got corrupted or something.
[323:04.82]And this is the opening cutscene again.
[323:09.62]Am I going to play Final Fantasy XV?
[323:11.50]Maybe off stream.
[323:14.46]I'm not sure that's something I would want to stream, but I probably will eventually.
[323:19.56]Wasn't this the fucking very beginning?
[323:21.38]That's a loading screen, right?
[323:26.32]okay let's see alright I can already tell this is much better yeah this is way better back to normal essentially
[323:40.33]That's so fucked up.
[323:42.91]That's like an engine problem.
[323:45.39]If I were to guess.
[323:46.69]Because the longer the game runs, the worse the frame rate gets.
[323:50.10]Like I said, I've played dozens and dozens of games on this console for like 8 plus hours and that has never happened before.
[323:57.40]There's a memory leak.
[324:02.51]Okay, well, here we go.
[324:05.60]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[324:06.66]Here it goes again.
[324:07.36]Oh, shit.
[324:09.41]Well, whatever.
[324:09.89]I'm gonna have to deal with it.
[324:21.74]Nah, it's way better at this point.
[324:26.14]I'm sure it's something fucked up.
[324:27.26]They'll probably patch it or something.
[324:28.52]Who knows?
[324:30.58]I'll just keep going where I was going.
[324:35.58]Now that I can see the game, is there anything that I missed down here?
[324:39.05]Uh, probably.
[324:47.27]Okay.
[324:49.61]There's a treat.
[324:50.39]He's hungry.
[324:50.83]I got a treat for you.
[324:53.01]Listen to all the bugs.
[324:57.88]Little rats and bugs and all kinds of critters.
[325:08.02]Can I throw it up there?
[325:11.26]I guess I can just walk it up if I'm careful enough.
[325:24.72]Should I throw it there now?
[325:26.80]Should I go for a toss?
[325:28.04]What do you think?
[325:28.48]Toss it?
[325:30.64]Toss it out of the hole?
[325:31.36]Okay.
[325:38.83]That didn't really help me, though.
[325:42.06]I guess it kind of did, yeah.
[325:43.02]It kind of did.
[325:45.50]Alright, throw it again.
[325:49.82]Right over there.
[325:50.88]Is that gonna reach?
[325:55.21]Yes, it is.
[325:58.61]Oh, shut up!
[325:59.61]Come on!
[326:00.03]No, get... Get back here!
[326:03.15]Fuck, that was... If I didn't just slip like a dumbass, that would have been perfectly fine.
[326:16.12]What a crock of shit.
[326:28.78]Gravity?
[326:30.64]Yeah, what the hell, gravity?
[326:33.62]No, don't do that again.
[326:35.38]I'm gonna try to get locked in the corner over there.
[326:38.16]And I'm gonna go immediately.
[326:48.53]We're almost there.
[326:49.13]We're so close to having that work.
[326:51.01]Let me make sure I'm not doing that wrong.
[326:55.41]Okay.
[326:56.99]I'll just step up.
[326:58.61]The whole thing.
[327:00.17]I don't think that was supposed to happen, but I'll take that glitch.
[327:04.80]Take that glitch any day of the week.
[327:07.78]Especially on Monday.
[327:09.52]Monday sucks.
[327:17.24]Okay.
[327:21.53]Don't fall.
[327:22.33]Don't fall down the hole.
[327:27.86]Use your immense circus act skills to get over there.
[327:30.54]Thank you.
[327:31.16]Okay.
[327:34.44]We got him a snack.
[327:39.46]It's Wednesday.
[327:40.22]It's Tuesday.
[327:40.92]Well, technically Wednesday now.
[327:48.07]Mm-hmm.
[327:49.25]Yeah, look what I got.
[327:51.83]Look what I got besides 10 frames a second.
[327:55.41]A cookie!
[327:59.35]You're never ready for that, aren't you?
[328:12.98]Good job, eat it.
[328:17.56]Okay, you ready to go back to work?
[328:22.22]Yeah, he's ready.
[328:23.10]Good job.
[328:23.60]Okay, let's keep going here.
[328:25.48]He's so happy.
[328:29.70]What, do you want more?
[328:35.59]I don't think I have any more.
[328:37.17]I don't think there's any more hidden treat barrels down here.
[328:48.47]Can I pull this this way?
[328:49.57]No, it's going to go the other way.
[328:53.19]Alright, well now... I just need to move this, right?
[328:59.13]Push it forward and then open the gate.
[329:00.45]Or hold the gate open.
[329:02.35]He should come in, right?
[329:04.39]That's the theory.
[329:08.64]No, no, wait a minute.
[329:10.16]This will move on its own.
[329:18.11]What did Sark say?
[329:19.67]I missed it.
[329:20.87]What's going on, Sark?
[329:21.61]How are you?
[329:22.37]Sark, when do you stream?
[329:23.51]Do you stream?
[329:24.09]I'm trying to catch one of your streams.
[329:29.08]If you haven't followed Mr. Sark on the various platforms like YouTube, Twitter, twitch.tv, Facebook, LiveJournal,
[329:44.92]LinkedIn alright come on push it shove it through Come on you know you push it do it Kick it with your face There you go come on come on come on do it do it do it there you go Plus
[330:10.32]Mr. Sark is... I would say he's probably one of the funniest, most relatable, fun guys on YouTube or on the internet.
[330:22.43]I'll take that to the grave.
[330:25.27]God, bury me with those words.
[330:27.85]It's been months been editing and keeping these damn babies alive.
[330:33.96]Well, that takes precedence, I would assume.
[330:37.22]I would assume, of course I would assume.
[330:38.52]Alright, he's in here now.
[330:39.54]Now what do we do?
[330:40.10]I got you in.
[330:47.94]What the hell else is there to do?
[330:48.97]This is probably a hole I can climb through somewhere on the top somewhere.
[331:07.25]Do we need to get these to go down?
[331:10.81]What about over here?
[331:11.45]I mean, there's a little... I did come down here before.
[331:18.64]Jump over this.
[331:23.42]Really dark.
[331:26.04]I have no idea this is for any reason.
[331:28.18]Can you come down here?
[331:31.51]Flashlight.
[331:38.99]Traco, is there anything in here that we can do?
[331:41.07]Use your eyes to light the room up, please.
[331:47.50]Oh, look at that.
[331:48.76]Okay.
[331:50.94]How do I get up there?
[331:55.66]Grab him for a second.
[332:02.57]Wrap around, go in his leg.
[332:08.40]It's got to be something I can grab onto up here somewhere.
[332:12.14]Light the way.
[332:12.76]Oh, and I think I may have found it.
[332:17.54]Right there.
[332:18.46]What are you jumping?
[332:19.74]What are you doing?
[332:24.42]Can you stand up for me so I can climb on that?
[332:30.65]Easy.
[332:33.35]Looks like I can grab that ledge.
[332:37.03]You are not enough.
[332:43.17]What the fuck?
[332:45.69]What the fuck just happened?
[332:47.83]What?
[332:49.13]Why did you do that?
[332:49.85]How did you do that?
[332:51.17]Where are we?
[332:53.71]Where did we just go?
[332:59.67]Alright.
[333:01.36]Good job, dog.
[333:03.43]I guess we were supposed to go through the hole in the ceiling.
[333:07.63]Don't fall back down.
[333:08.33]I just want to make sure there's nothing else down here.
[333:15.12]Okay, well.
[333:18.24]Now, this thing looks pretty unsturdy.
[333:19.56]I want you to smash your head into this like you did last time.
[333:22.50]Get it.
[333:25.10]I'm so glad they didn't make you climb that whole thing.
[333:26.80]Yeah, that would have been a pain in the ass.
[333:31.96]Why didn't he do that earlier?
[333:32.82]I don't know.
[333:34.50]He should smash this.
[333:35.46]It looks pretty easy to break.
[333:41.31]Yeah.
[333:44.19]Yeah.
[333:47.39]Okay.
[333:50.17]Oh, there we go.
[333:50.79]There we go.
[333:53.05]More stupid eyeballs things to do.
[333:58.18]Mr. Trait.
[333:58.84]That's alright.
[334:00.64]He got one.
[334:08.40]Hey!
[334:10.20]Calm down.
[334:13.94]Will he not jump over there?
[334:15.32]Because that's there.
[334:17.87]Or is he being a weirdo?
[334:19.61]What's he doing here?
[334:24.81]Is he going to do something here?
[334:27.35]Come on.
[334:28.65]Jump to that?
[334:29.31]Or should I make scale around?
[334:30.83]What?
[334:36.05]What are we looking at?
[334:39.92]Okay.
[334:45.81]What the?
[334:47.15]There's more than one Trico?
[334:49.73]Does he jump into that?
[334:57.39]I hope he's not, because... He kind of... I don't think he will.
[335:06.46]Will he just jump over to that platform?
[335:08.04]Maybe he will.
[335:10.69]Over there, to there, to there.
[335:12.03]He just won't go over there.
[335:13.03]Maybe we can get him to go that way.
[335:16.90]I'll try that.
[335:19.08]Is the... Yeah, this is not going to do anything for me, I don't think.
[335:21.14]No.
[335:21.42]There's, like, spikes all over this ship.
[335:24.72]Just get back on him.
[335:28.60]Alright, go to that platform.
[335:33.52]You won't be afraid of that one, will you?
[335:34.58]Yeah, he's going for it.
[335:37.02]Come on, Draco!
[335:37.74]No!
[335:46.52]Good work, dog.
[335:48.38]Next one.
[335:54.24]And the next one, will you jump through this?
[335:58.43]No.
[336:00.53]But can I?
[336:01.07]There's a little tightrope there.
[336:08.02]If I drop, am I going to walk on that or grab it?
[336:10.00]I think I will.
[336:15.30]Let's see.
[336:16.12]Just don't move, dog.
[336:25.91]Hey, I'm fine.
[336:27.33]I did it.
[336:29.55]No big deal.
[336:31.11]Just almost jumped to my death.
[336:32.36]It's alright.
[336:39.54]This green moss to climb.
[336:41.54]We'll get there.
[336:45.35]that noise.
[336:48.87]Your arms would just break.
[336:50.33]What?
[336:50.85]Get it.
[336:51.35]Climb up.
[336:59.89]You made it this far.
[337:01.51]Just get to the weeds.
[337:03.45]Thank you.
[337:09.65]My butthole is puckered.
[337:10.79]I've been doing a whole lot of butthole puckering this game.
[337:21.64]Okay.
[337:23.20]Still right... Where is it?
[337:24.50]Right there.
[337:26.88]Ow.
[337:28.64]I think we just have to scale this way.
[337:30.38]What does that lead to?
[337:31.80]Uh... Uh-huh.
[337:39.94]Uh... Okay.
[337:43.43]I think I have to go... That way first.
[337:48.79]Let's try the hypothesis.
[337:51.54]I think I just get scale over here and then make my way across.
[337:59.90]Boy, this is so dangerous.
[338:03.28]This is so fucked.
[338:06.37]Oh my god.
[338:07.31]Camera, do not do this to me.
[338:15.75]If I'm in this situation, no.
[338:18.09]Leave me dead in the first room.
[338:23.32]Like when I woke up and I'm like, what's wrong with me?
[338:25.10]Why are those tattoos on me?
[338:26.06]Why is this giant?
[338:26.73]No, I'm just taking a spear and I'm going to jump on it.
[338:30.55]I'm like setting a spear up and like running it into the wall through my body.
[338:34.45]I ain't doing this shit.
[338:45.46]So much of it.
[338:46.00]I mean, you're going to really, you're actually going to do that.
[338:52.53]Of course they would.
[338:53.81]Why wouldn't they do that?
[338:55.55]Of course.
[338:56.19]That was pretty cool.
[339:05.87]I would have fallen off while I was deciding to try it.
[339:10.61]That's a long way down.
[339:13.07]I didn't miss something down there, did I?
[339:14.33]I don't have to go all the way down.
[339:17.59]It's been fun, but you've got to be up in five hours.
[339:19.01]See you.
[339:19.23]Well, thanks for sticking around, man.
[339:21.19]Have a good night, gummy bear.
[339:24.95]Almost there.
[339:31.25]Yeah, there's a... Isn't the, like, the Ico... What's he doing?
[339:35.52]Isn't the whole Ico collection on PS3?
[339:39.06]Yeah, it is.
[339:39.42]You can get, like, the HD version.
[339:40.64]Alright, I need to go up again and do it again.
[339:45.23]Climbing walls.
[339:51.91]What's the story behind the game?
[339:53.43]That's something we have yet to figure out.
[339:58.15]How much longer will I stream?
[340:00.59]How long have I been going right now?
[340:01.69]Five hours?
[340:02.15]Five and a half?
[340:03.26]Six?
[340:05.36]We'll see how I feel in... I don't know.
[340:08.24]Once I get to the end of this little puzzle area.
[340:09.70]Kind of climbing zone.
[340:15.55]Oh, that's pretty cool looking.
[340:17.97]Gorgeous.
[340:21.47]Alright.
[340:22.27]Wish me luck.
[340:32.88]I'm telling you, I'm getting serious Heart of Darkness vibes.
[340:35.33]Don't think about the areas, like the climbing stuff.
[340:42.67]Alright guys, place your bets.
[340:43.63]Is this rope gonna break?
[340:47.13]If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen in like five seconds.
[340:59.23]Do I always stream at night?
[341:00.10]Yeah.
[341:01.29]Well, actually, that's not entirely true.
[341:04.38]Sometimes, during the weekends, I'll start at like 3 or 4 o'clock.
[341:12.40]For the most part, yeah, I start at 7 o'clock Eastern.
[341:14.56]7 p.m.
[341:18.02]Or I'm 5 minutes late like I was today.
[341:23.16]Alright.
[341:24.54]Be careful, dog.
[341:27.59]I don't want this to clock you in the head.
[341:33.64]What in the name?
[341:35.90]Hold on.
[341:42.78]Now what?
[341:43.76]Is he going to come over here?
[341:44.44]Can I drop down on him?
[341:46.38]Yeah, he's going to drop right here, isn't he?
[341:47.56]Okay.
[341:49.75]Oh, shit.
[341:50.77]Look at this.
[341:52.37]What a nightmare.
[341:56.19]What an actual nightmare.
[341:59.95]I have to grab that and then drop over there.
[342:02.31]Can I... Can I... Should I just go for it?
[342:03.87]What do you guys think?
[342:04.77]Go for this?
[342:05.11]The jump?
[342:07.77]Where are you going?
[342:08.63]Don't go without me.
[342:11.29]I know you're looking for me, but man, this is not good.
[342:13.87]I need to... Come on.
[342:21.24]Just please dip forward.
[342:22.96]It's gonna work, right?
[342:23.68]This game has a bunch of physics in it.
[342:27.84]Come on, please.
[342:28.56]Physics.
[342:29.56]Physics.
[342:33.11]Physics.
[342:37.37]Physics.
[342:37.99]Physics.
[342:41.05]Fuck this.
[342:41.93]We're going for it.
[342:47.34]I can drop right here.
[342:49.02]And we just pray to the physics gods.
[342:51.74]Alright.
[342:55.92]Slow, slow.
[342:56.60]I gotta get on that one and then drop down to him.
[343:04.36]This is not... I don't like this at all.
[343:12.31]Not like I don't like the game.
[343:13.27]I just don't... This is like fucking me over.
[343:15.29]This is making me so stressed out.
[343:19.18]climb up let's do this right no we're not gonna do it right I'm just gonna say screw this I'm jumping off I gotta get off this before I like have a heart attack alright we're good we're fine we made it alright on to the next area right he can probably I think he can jump off that
[343:45.08]I love sweating my balls off while I eat dinner.
[343:48.54]Go faster?
[343:49.32]I don't want to go faster.
[343:53.71]Faster means potentially dying.
[343:55.51]Yeah, who needs bones?
[344:03.75]I've broken like so many at this point.
[344:05.28]Doesn't matter.
[344:05.78]He's gonna jump up to that ledge.
[344:07.04]Hopefully.
[344:09.56]Right?
[344:09.76]Are you going to jump up there?
[344:11.26]Or are you going to... Where are you aiming?
[344:17.68]He seems to be looking towards that direction.
[344:19.97]I don't think he's supposed to be doing that.
[344:23.25]He'll be going that way, dog.
[344:25.31]This way.
[344:26.91]Jump that way.
[344:31.12]Come on.
[344:31.42]I know you can do that.
[344:32.12]There you go.
[344:32.96]Right there.
[344:36.48]Slowly but surely, he figures it out.
[344:38.98]Did he break a horn?
[344:40.68]Okay.
[344:47.71]Is he still going?
[344:49.23]Or can I... Oh, he's gonna walk around.
[344:57.62]This is all on him at this point.
[344:59.10]And then I see the moss.
[345:05.31]Okay.
[345:06.25]Can he get up there?
[345:07.07]Is he going to get up there?
[345:07.91]Is he gonna jump for it?
[345:10.51]Fuck yes he is.
[345:11.33]Of course he is.
[345:17.15]Whoa!
[345:17.39]Okay.
[345:17.49]That was a skillful move right there, guys.
[345:19.15]I don't think you guys understand.
[345:20.39]I had to just hit X, drop, hit triangle, grab.
[345:23.05]Like, that was a fucking skillful move.
[345:25.59]I'd like to see a couple of- I'd like to see at least one PogChamp.
[345:28.77]I would've fallen if I wasn't such a skilled gamer.
[345:36.49]Alright, where are we going now?
[345:48.94]This way?
[345:50.88]Oh, fuck.
[345:52.92]Alright, here we go.
[345:55.40]I'm gonna have to go around this way.
[345:57.58]Too dangerous.
[345:58.22]Where's this kid's parents?
[346:04.20]Can he not fly?
[346:04.80]He cannot fly.
[346:06.38]His wings are all screwed up, I think.
[346:09.68]Too many fog chains.
[346:11.55]What are you doing?
[346:31.94]I feel like he needs to knock this shit down.
[346:34.46]Can he do this?
[346:35.60]Hey, you.
[346:37.00]Can you, like, swipe this?
[346:39.14]Or something, somehow?
[346:39.98]Can I just climb over it?
[346:52.05]Can I squeeze through?
[346:53.25]Alright, I guess I can just squeeze through.
[346:58.06]Stop playing chess when you need to play checkers.
[347:00.10]People have been saying that.
[347:00.98]It's true.
[347:11.92]Let's get rid of this.
[347:12.88]Hold on.
[347:13.62]Let me make sure there's no treats over here.
[347:18.78]No, fuck it.
[347:19.20]Let's just get rid of this.
[347:19.84]I'm going to have to turn around immediately because this is going to fall.
[347:32.83]For sure.
[347:33.61]Pull it and...
[347:49.45]This would be a pretty good time for you to come and get me.
[347:53.55]You know, this would be a great time if you could come and get me.
[347:56.07]I would really appreciate it.
[347:59.55]Where are you?
[348:00.89]Hello?
[348:02.25]Hello?
[348:04.31]Oh, God.
[348:04.89]He's ready.
[348:06.67]He's ready.
[348:21.80]He was just looking at me.
[348:23.24]He was just looking at me.
[348:24.98]God damn it.
[348:32.50]He's just sitting there like, oh, well, look, you seem to be falling.
[348:45.40]Where did it... Oh, come on.
[348:47.14]Really?
[348:47.54]You're going to make me do this shit again?
[348:55.98]I'm not going to do this all over again.
[349:00.62]I guess I had to wait an extra three or four seconds or something.
[349:03.52]At least he did try.
[349:05.50]He tried.
[349:05.86]That's alright.
[349:08.96]We're going to do speedrun strategy because I know where to go.
[349:12.89]I was waiting for him to... The tail or something.
[349:16.67]It did this to us before.
[349:17.73]It was like, he didn't catch you, but you got the tail.
[349:20.25]Yeah, I guess.
[349:24.71]Whatever.
[349:24.98]It's not that far.
[349:26.72]Let's hope he catches us this time.
[349:34.64]Let's try it again, dog.
[349:35.94]This time, I would appreciate you to actually catch me.
[349:42.19]Alright, here we go.
[349:46.35]Oh no, my master's in trouble.
[349:49.49]I gotta go.
[349:50.09]I gotta figure out what to do.
[349:51.17]I'm too stupid.
[349:51.75]I'm just a dumb dog.
[349:52.79]I don't know.
[349:55.45]I think I know what to do.
[350:00.12]I come down this way, and then I... Okay, I'm gonna get you.
[350:04.48]I'll get you.
[350:04.88]Okay, go now!
[350:08.15]Go!
[350:08.31]Go!
[350:08.77]Go!
[350:24.54]He almost didn't get me again.
[350:26.82]What the fuck?
[350:28.80]What the fuck?
[350:35.32]What did I tell you about the shirt?
[350:36.68]I knew it.
[350:37.12]Eventually the shirt was gonna rip.
[350:39.94]I could smell it like three hours ago.
[350:44.60]He did good, dog.
[350:50.86]He just rips my head off.
[350:51.88]That would be terrible.
[350:54.39]Alright, scale to the top of the mountain.
[351:01.94]You can do it.
[351:02.32]It's right there.
[351:03.52]Come on.
[351:05.18]It's not much further.
[351:06.10]You got it.
[351:08.10]Go meet the other dog, cat, bird, giraffe, lemur thing.
[351:18.39]Oh, that's tricky.
[351:20.03]Don't scare me like that.
[351:24.87]Any more?
[351:25.23]Are we at the top?
[351:26.83]One more jump.
[351:28.99]I don't pet him enough.
[351:29.87]Yes, I do.
[351:30.97]He knows I love him.
[351:31.61]This is a very intense situation here.
[351:34.31]I need him to be on his A game.
[351:35.51]I don't want him to be relaxed.
[351:37.21]I want him to be ready to make these incredibly difficult jumps.
[351:41.09]Why did I just say it like that?
[351:43.04]Incredibly difficult.
[351:43.88]Why didn't I just say incredibly difficult?
[351:56.63]What's at the top of this?
[351:58.55]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if there's just one treat barrel and that's the only reason why I wanted to come up here.
[352:05.91]We scaled this whole thing.
[352:07.07]It's just a treat barrel.
[352:08.88]They're my favorite.
[352:10.38]Look at that face.
[352:14.14]Look at this face.
[352:15.08]This is such a cool animal.
[352:20.68]One more.
[352:21.10]Maybe more than one.
[352:33.02]Okay.
[352:33.78]Turn around.
[352:34.10]There's one... There's a bunch more.
[352:35.72]There's more than one more.
[352:39.02]I love how he's smart enough at this point to start doing this on his own.
[352:41.80]Without me.
[352:44.48]164 swears?
[352:46.62]In six hours?
[352:47.56]That's not bad.
[352:57.02]How many swear words are in the Sopranos?
[352:59.73]That was like 4,000 swears in like two seasons.
[353:02.66]I'm okay.
[353:03.12]I'm doing fine.
[353:06.60]Nice jump.
[353:08.68]That bridge fell.
[353:13.81]The whole thing is falling.
[353:15.43]The whole thing is going down.
[353:18.01]Don't jump.
[353:18.85]Oh, God.
[353:19.93]The whole thing is going down.
[353:25.55]Oh, God.
[353:35.72]Wow.
[353:37.84]What the fuck?
[353:39.06]Ah!
[353:39.90]There's another one!
[353:44.72]What?
[353:45.58]No!
[353:45.98]No!
[353:47.48]No!
[353:54.41]That was crazy.
[353:59.67]Good thing we climbed that whole tower.
[354:18.07]Please don't be dead.
[354:19.11]I hope he's not dead and then I have to like brief befriend the other one Please be alive still I'm gonna be so sad if he's dead
[354:38.99]No!
[354:40.67]Fuck!
[354:41.27]Get me down!
[354:41.81]Can I climb the tree?
[354:47.99]This is gonna... This is gonna break.
[354:54.65]Eventually.
[354:55.81]Maybe not.
[354:57.43]Alright, this is the game.
[355:05.12]This is the rest of the game.
[355:06.02]And then I eventually starve to death up here.
[355:14.41]Is he alive?
[355:14.99]He's alive!
[355:15.36]He's alive!
[355:16.76]You guys thought he was dead.
[355:17.52]I did too.
[355:18.14]He's fine.
[355:18.80]He's just a little battered up.
[355:23.58]Come get me.
[355:30.05]See?
[355:30.49]Oh, thank God he's okay.
[355:32.11]Come on.
[355:33.35]Can you get up here and help me?
[355:37.29]Look it.
[355:37.73]And after falling through like 2,000 feet...
[355:43.17]Oh, he's fucked up too.
[355:44.75]He's all bloodied and shit.
[355:49.97]Oh, look at his head.
[355:50.82]Look at his face.
[355:52.96]His eyes messed up.
[355:55.74]Oh, this is... This is making me feel so bad.
[355:59.84]Come on.
[356:00.24]Can you come fight me?
[356:01.16]Come get me.
[356:04.30]You can do it.
[356:06.14]One more.
[356:06.74]Oh, he's like, please, I want to get you.
[356:13.09]He's close.
[356:16.41]No, wait, he's figuring it out.
[356:20.47]He's going to do something here.
[356:24.27]There he goes.
[356:24.85]No!
[356:24.99]God damn it.
[356:40.68]Why am I trying?
[356:41.88]I can't get off, dog.
[356:45.30]Can you, like, grab the branch?
[356:50.12]What about, like, right here?
[356:56.25]It's a strong shirt, I know, right?
[357:03.33]No, he kind of had it for a second there.
[357:05.11]He came over here and, like, jumped onto the side.
[357:11.26]Can you just jump up here?
[357:12.74]Come on.
[357:14.01]There he goes.
[357:14.39]Come on.
[357:15.05]Grab it.
[357:16.11]There it is.
[357:16.61]There it is.
[357:20.51]Rip this thing down.
[357:23.03]Can I what?
[357:23.41]I can't grab his tail or anything.
[357:25.61]Come on.
[357:28.52]Give me the tail.
[357:31.18]Give me the tail.
[357:32.36]Give me the tail.

[358:13.71]Can I, like, pet you and take a small bath?
[358:18.49]Where are you going?
[358:23.28]Okay, I think we need to... No, actually, we need to go that way.
[358:27.06]Looks like I can move my way through here.
[358:32.88]I'm kind of surprised I still don't have an option to get that disc out from him somehow, you know?
[358:38.22]Can I climb here?
[358:42.64]Kind of.
[358:44.00]No.
[358:49.51]Where is he?
[358:51.55]Where'd he go?
[358:52.31]He's down there.
[358:55.13]There's a spot right there.
[358:57.43]No, we've already been in this room.
[359:09.31]Go down.
[359:09.59]I already pulled this thing, right?
[359:14.30]I remember this.
[359:14.86]I recognize this place, yeah.
[359:28.25]Right, but some... Where are we trying to get out?
[359:30.53]Where are we trying to go now?
[359:35.63]Let's get back.
[359:38.03]Let's get to the ground and see.
[359:41.25]Anything in particular?
[359:42.29]We destroyed the whole thing, so maybe we took out something?
[359:45.01]We can pet him to heal the wounds.
[359:49.24]What about through here?
[359:52.58]I mean, I can go out here.
[359:58.88]Is that going to do anything for me?
[360:00.89]Huh.
[360:15.38]What is that?
[360:19.94]Oh, no.
[360:23.39]Decided to go get more barrels.
[360:24.99]Alright.
[360:27.77]It's time to get some barrels.
[360:29.33]Come here, you.
[360:30.57]Oh, look.
[360:35.23]There's a barrel right there.
[360:36.75]So he wants to eat.
[360:37.77]He's hungry.
[360:38.19]Alright.
[360:39.31]We're going to give him a good ear scratching here.
[360:46.22]Is that better?
[360:47.56]You feel better right here.
[360:48.38]Right behind the ear.
[360:52.67]The right one needs it too.
[360:53.91]Look at it.
[360:56.55]You okay?
[360:56.95]How do you feel?
[360:59.39]Are you feeling a little better?
[361:00.27]Okay, good.
[361:05.13]Don't pet his wound.
[361:05.85]I didn't pet his wound.
[361:06.63]I pet his ear.
[361:09.25]Here, I'm going to get you a treat.
[361:12.75]You deserve it after getting your eye ripped out.
[361:15.50]Poor dog.
[361:20.35]get that it's right here got it I just walk up I don't think it'll be that easy but might be no nope I'm gonna walk around and up should be able to throw it from here
[361:52.19]Let me just take a look.
[362:00.41]Um... Get it.
[362:08.89]Okay.
[362:21.14]Uh...
[362:23.77]How am I going to get this to him?
[362:30.53]Up around these stairs right there.
[362:34.16]So we've got to go that way with it.
[362:36.56]Hopefully this reaches.
[362:39.42]Shit!
[362:45.99]That's what you have to do.
[362:46.79]I just didn't do it.
[362:47.31]You've got to go all the way around with it.
[362:50.89]Okie dokie.
[362:58.98]Throw the barrel at him to heal.
[363:03.56]That's not gonna do it.
[363:22.04]And then this should do it, right?
[363:24.97]Because then I can walk around.
[363:26.74]Can I?
[363:27.06]I'm not going to throw it again.
[363:29.04]This sucks.
[363:32.12]Alright, do I throw it up there?
[363:41.05]Hopefully this is right.
[363:45.19]I think it is.
[363:45.69]Yeah, that's right.
[363:49.67]Alright, here you go, dog.
[363:51.24]Let's go.
[363:59.33]He will die if you do not pet his wounds.
[364:01.29]What?
[364:05.44]The wounds.
[364:06.20]The wounds.
[364:07.52]He's gonna die?
[364:08.00]He's not gonna die.
[364:08.70]He's fine.
[364:09.70]Don't worry.
[364:11.68]Look, I'm gonna pet him more.
[364:12.62]I just wanted to get him a snack.
[364:15.28]He deserves this.
[364:16.68]I worked a lot to go throw this barrel back and forth.
[364:20.95]Hey, look what I got.
[364:21.71]Look what I got.
[364:25.53]I don't want to drop it because I don't want to break it.
[364:31.94]You ready?
[364:34.66]Here it comes!
[364:39.78]Get it!
[364:40.64]What's going on here?
[364:44.41]Okay, catch it!
[364:46.57]It's dinner for you!
[364:47.67]Fuck!
[364:51.11]I'm so sorry.
[364:52.03]I'm so sorry.
[364:53.83]Come here.
[364:58.57]Try it, go.
[365:02.68]See?
[365:07.68]Everything's gonna be fine.
[365:12.04]There we go.
[365:18.63]See?
[365:19.61]I made it all better.
[365:20.39]Let's get the other ones.
[365:21.61]Let's pet your eye.
[365:25.09]Come here, you.
[365:25.63]It's okay.
[365:25.85]Can I see your face?
[365:27.65]Can I pet your eyeball?
[365:33.39]Can I get down, please?
[365:34.23]I don't think I can climb on his face.
[365:41.62]Come here.
[365:45.66]There's a couple over here.
[365:46.52]Come here.
[365:53.29]Get rid of these ones.
[365:54.21]Okay.
[365:58.67]Okay.
[366:00.61]There's one on the shoulder here, too.
[366:02.17]He's so destroyed.
[366:04.33]Draco.
[366:05.73]Draco.
[366:09.81]Did I get that one?
[366:10.77]Okay.
[366:13.51]One on the back.
[366:18.61]It's kind of just like cleaning up blood.
[366:28.13]He got destroyed.
[366:35.83]Look, I'm like one of those... It's a symbiotic relationship.
[366:39.53]You know the rhinos?
[366:40.35]I'm like the little weird shitbird that cleans up the rhino's ass.
[366:44.01]What are those things called?
[366:55.46]He left his... Left horn grew back?
[366:57.12]Well, that's good.
[366:58.02]He just needs to chill for a little bit.
[366:59.08]He's alright.
[367:03.18]He's even in better spirits already.
[367:04.44]See?
[367:07.08]So we get the one that's underneath us right here.
[367:16.61]I don't think that's how it works.
[367:17.87]Alright, how do you feel?
[367:20.46]You alright?
[367:21.44]Is everything a little bit better?
[367:22.36]I will get you the food and I'll put it right in front of you.
[367:27.12]I'm going to hand deliver this to you.
[367:32.76]Alright, we'll just do like a fucking Looney Tunes jump and fuck it all up.
[367:35.50]Alright, here we go.
[367:36.36]Alright, here you go.
[367:42.97]Eat.
[367:44.63]I'll put it right down for you.
[367:46.81]That should give you extra energy.
[367:49.37]Oh, yes.
[367:51.29]His eye is still screwed up.
[367:56.17]You need that depth perception when we're going to be doing later.
[367:58.31]Can I fix his eye?
[368:04.52]He's standing now.
[368:05.16]I want to fix his eye.
[368:07.04]His eye is so messed up.
[368:08.64]Or is it just closed for the rest of the game?
[368:11.36]Oh, he's moving.
[368:13.50]He wants to go somewhere.
[368:17.31]He wants to go right now.
[368:18.69]Okay, I guess we're going.
[368:22.17]You didn't have to go that fast.
[368:23.39]We didn't have to do this this quickly.
[368:28.29]I'm going to let you do what you want to do.
[368:29.51]I still have to pet your neck.
[368:34.06]His eye opened when he got the barrel.
[368:35.18]That's good.
[368:36.42]Get us out of here.
[368:40.42]Get us the hell out of here.
[368:41.60]How's your eye?
[368:49.17]It's still closed.
[368:54.01]A few more jumps.
[368:58.73]You know what?
[368:59.23]I think the claw got him in the eye.
[369:01.24]That's what it was, right?
[369:03.73]I'm not sure I can do anything about that.
[369:05.01]He's going to think one eye for the rest of the game.
[369:06.71]Let's kind of let him do his thing here.
[369:16.40]How close am I to the end?
[369:17.88]I don't think I'm that close.
[369:20.88]At least four or five hours until the end.
[369:23.90]At least.
[369:24.86]Alright.
[369:25.16]Where are we now?
[369:25.78]Let's take a look.
[369:26.68]Where are we?
[369:28.70]Up there?
[369:29.52]Looks like he needs to jump up there.
[369:30.82]Alright.
[369:36.92]I think so.
[369:37.26]I think you just need to jump to there.
[369:46.98]You know, you could jump to that.
[369:48.41]Which is what I think you're supposed to be doing.
[369:51.55]Go on.
[369:54.99]There you go.
[370:00.45]Someone said I'm over halfway.
[370:03.13]Yeah, I heard the game was 12 hours long, like 10 to 12.
[370:07.61]Maybe it didn't take a long time.
[370:10.45]I mean, I'm six hours in right now.
[370:11.75]I'm assuming I'm probably like halfway through the game, so that would make sense.
[370:16.31]Alright.
[370:17.53]I don't think you can jump to there, but can you put your face up there for me?
[370:23.91]Put your face up.
[370:25.69]Come on.
[370:26.35]A little bit more.
[370:28.25]Just a little bit more.
[370:30.89]Whoa, okay.
[370:32.77]I thought I was supposed to jump, but apparently it was you.
[370:34.81]That's a tiny little spot.
[370:42.86]To stop and finish the game tomorrow?
[370:44.32]I mean, I'm having fun.
[370:47.48]I knew I was going to go for a long time tonight just because it's like launch day and I've been looking forward to playing this.
[370:52.41]Yeah, you're an enemy that's slightly different.
[370:59.66]He won't jump over there, so... I'm going to have to figure out a way to get over there.
[371:05.94]That's kind of bullshit.
[371:12.60]Will he just dive over there?
[371:13.68]Of course he won't.
[371:17.32]Okay, I see.
[371:20.12]I see.
[371:20.44]I hope I was right!
[371:24.14]I hope I was right!
[371:26.26]I was right.
[371:31.79]I think I have to get those guys to turn this way, right?
[371:41.24]Just jump from there and then I think I can climb up, right?
[371:43.16]Hopefully.
[371:44.58]Hopefully.
[371:55.32]Spot over there.
[371:56.52]Let's climb up and just take a look.
[372:13.88]Mmm, I got a feelin' that tonight's gonna be a good night.
[372:19.63]Did I tell you that I got a feelin'?
[372:23.37]Mmm, I almost missed it.
[372:27.23]There's gonna be something around this side to climb up.
[372:31.41]No, there isn't.
[372:33.51]Hey, yes, there is.
[372:34.58]Of course there is, right there.
[372:37.70]Oh, goddammit!
[372:39.64]I thought I was fuckin' right there.
[372:43.32]Oh, that's what I had.
[372:44.66]I knew I had to do that, and I fucking just missed it.
[372:46.76]How did I just miss that?
[372:47.79]At least we're right here.
[372:51.65]God, come on.
[372:55.47]Like, the easiest thing to do, and apparently... Look at how much I skipped.
[373:01.68]I did, like, the speedrun strategy, too.
[373:11.79]It's like the depth perception just wasn't there.
[373:13.97]I thought it was on the edge and I just wasn't.
[373:15.27]He still needs healing.
[373:17.36]I'll heal him after, don't worry.
[373:20.98]See, now I'm gonna like rush this and it's gonna happen again.
[373:26.16]Don't slip.
[373:34.09]I wonder if this game is like speedrunnable.
[373:36.39]It would be extremely impressive, but look that looks a little high.
[373:42.65]Can I even get that?
[373:44.45]Shit.
[373:45.32]Looks too high.
[373:48.18]Okay, I can.
[373:51.52]Kind of like if I was missing... Yeah, I'm just roleplaying.
[373:59.78]Pet the balloon?
[374:00.62]What?
[374:02.38]I got a couple of windows to look in.
[374:07.34]So, theoretically...
[374:10.52]I jump down here.
[374:11.34]They'll... Ah, God.
[374:16.42]Well, don't jump down here.
[374:17.78]That would be a terrible mistake.
[374:20.98]I just got to get those guys up there to turn around and then try to go jump on them and I can... It will be okay.
[374:25.05]So I'm going to go to the far window.
[374:30.47]I missed like five secrets right here.
[374:34.51]Alright.
[374:39.43]We're gonna go with the hypothesis that turn these guys around.
[374:42.09]They are turned around.
[374:42.65]No, they're not.
[374:46.91]Okay, here we go.
[374:50.27]Charge into.
[374:53.87]Come on, I didn't really get a chance.
[374:59.79]Sorry, just mash every button.
[375:00.51]You'll be safe.
[375:04.15]Ay!
[375:11.26]One more, one more, one more!
[375:14.16]Drop the shield, you fucker!
[375:15.43]Come on!
[375:17.57]Come on!
[375:21.87]I need a running start on both of them.
[375:23.73]This is gonna be hard.
[375:30.23]Wait a second, guys.
[375:33.91]Did you see that?
[375:34.57]Like, oh!
[375:37.07]I'm gonna get these guys down here.
[375:38.24]There's three people down here.
[375:40.10]Come on.
[375:42.96]Alright, run to the first guy.
[375:49.90]Oh, false sprint!
[375:54.24]Come on!
[375:55.77]Get the fuck off!
[375:56.91]Come on!
[375:57.81]He still came down.
[376:04.95]He still did it.
[376:07.49]He still did it.
[376:08.79]He still did it.
[376:16.06]Wow.
[376:17.64]He faced his fears.
[376:19.36]He faced his fear and he did it.
[376:20.90]Wow.
[376:25.46]That was fucking unbelievable.
[376:28.20]Perfect.
[376:29.62]Easy now.
[376:31.36]Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down.
[376:34.29]Calm down.
[376:36.67]Let me take care of your neck while you sit in here.
[376:47.95]What?
[376:49.11]What is he doing?
[376:50.39]What is his face doing?
[376:53.73]I gotta get under his neck.
[376:55.83]I'm gonna drop down because I can't really see what the hell's going on.
[376:57.67]I need to get under his chin.
[377:06.93]Stop hacking the car away from me.
[377:08.24]I'll get you next time you stop for some food or something.
[377:11.94]Alright.
[377:13.30]So we made it across here.
[377:14.16]There's nothing else I can grab, I don't think.
[377:18.90]Nope.
[377:19.72]Onward.
[377:22.28]Can I sneak under here?
[377:27.29]There's one on his tail.
[377:28.25]I'll take care of that.
[377:28.91]Why can't I... There we go.
[377:34.21]Ooh, look what I got for you.
[377:39.94]It's something good.
[377:49.40]While you're eating, I... Hey.
[377:53.40]Will you just eat it from there?
[377:54.68]I don't want you to hit your face on a wall.
[377:58.09]Will you just grab it?
[377:58.77]Come on.
[377:59.03]I'm not sure you can.
[378:01.99]No, that's in a bad spot.
[378:02.85]I'll get it for you.
[378:03.83]Come here.
[378:05.93]Hey.
[378:07.29]Well.
[378:11.14]There you go.
[378:11.60]Go ahead.
[378:14.48]How many hours has this been out?
[378:15.74]I actually don't know when it actually launched.
[378:17.49]I think it was midnight of last night, right?
[378:19.87]Or today?
[378:20.21]Alright, while you do that, I'm going to fix you up a little bit more.
[378:28.03]I have a minute where I can do this.
[378:37.52]There you go.
[378:44.24]There you go.
[378:45.22]I got it all, right?
[378:46.88]I love how sometimes you just can't figure out how to eat.
[378:55.85]One of his legs over here.
[378:59.65]Okay.
[379:07.59]I should be spending my money on VR games, but this looks good.
[379:10.10]Should I get it?
[379:12.42]That's a, uh... That's a question that I really can't answer.
[379:18.20]Mainly because... It's a heavy, heavy story, kind of.
[379:24.93]Besides, like, some of the platforming.
[379:27.61]And a couple of the puzzles.
[379:28.73]The game sort of plays itself.
[379:31.70]You kind of rely on him doing a lot of the work while you make him able to do the work.
[379:40.78]But what is he doing?
[379:43.98]I would say if you're into games that are like an adventure story type games, you will probably love this.
[379:49.90]But there's not a whole lot of, I guess, in quotes, action.
[379:54.29]It's more like a scripted kind of playing a movie, adventure-wise.
[380:00.46]Which, I'm having a fucking blast.
[380:02.26]This game's a lot of fun.
[380:03.72]It's cool just to see all the events that happen, like him toppling the tower, and him fighting the enemy.
[380:08.60]It's good.
[380:10.25]Cut to the gorilla reading.
[380:13.99]But some people might get the wrong idea, because Shadow of the Colossus was a game about fighting monsters, and this is kind of like you ride the monster.
[380:22.90]And you let the monster do a lot of the work for you, I guess.
[380:25.56]If that makes any sense.
[380:35.44]Uh, can he come in here now?
[380:42.19]Uncharted in a different universe.
[380:43.39]Well, I wouldn't even say... I mean, you like... Ah, more enemies.
[380:46.79]Can he fit in here?
[380:50.87]Can I grab these guys or something?
[380:59.30]He's just in here, I guess.
[381:04.71]That's a door that I can't go in.
[381:06.01]Do I have any predictions for what's going to happen further in the game?
[381:11.07]No, I don't.
[381:11.65]I have no idea what's going to happen.
[381:14.31]Not a clue.
[381:16.12]And speaking of not a clue, I kind of don't know what the hell I'm doing at this point right now.
[381:22.58]Is there a window right there?
[381:23.86]There is.
[381:24.10]Okay.
[381:28.11]Seems a lot more comparable to Aiko.
[381:33.32]Okay, can you stop?
[381:36.30]Can you stop humping your tail around?
[381:40.40]I'm trying to climb you, dude.
[381:42.92]What is he doing?
[381:45.87]Easy.
[381:46.39]What's the problem?
[381:49.57]Yeah, this is much more like Aiko.
[381:53.11]It's a lot prettier, though.
[381:59.58]Okay, I can come out here for a reason, right?
[382:01.52]How the hell would I be able to do this?
[382:03.10]Can he come up here?
[382:03.99]Can you make it up here?
[382:11.03]Can we sneak out this way or no?
[382:19.37]Uh, maybe?
[382:30.58]Almost knocked me over.
[382:33.44]Can we jump from here?
[382:34.32]There's got to be a place to jump from here, right?
[382:38.16]What are you looking at?
[382:41.66]What do you see?
[382:43.84]I see over there.
[382:45.34]There I see over there.
[382:46.68]Right over there.
[382:50.44]Alright.
[382:51.34]Try to go.
[382:51.96]That way.
[382:56.54]Go for it.
[382:57.30]Come on, you.
[382:59.13]Jump.
[383:04.39]One would be the other way.
[383:07.43]Slow down.
[383:08.89]If you're gonna go up there, then go for it.
[383:19.15]Hell, I've got to sleep.
[383:19.97]Yeah, I'll probably... Once we kind of get into this area up here, I might take a... Call my leave, I guess you could say.
[383:27.15]Oh, there's another one of those things up here.
[383:30.43]Oh, wait for me to get off you before you freak out about the fucking pie smell.
[383:38.17]Let me take a look.
[383:42.59]Drop.
[383:45.46]Gonna have to do some moving around of the pie smell.
[383:49.89]Alright, um... We're kind of in this new spot.
[383:52.83]I'm assuming it's more of the... We need to do a little bit more to get to another stopping place, but... I'm gonna call it here.
[384:01.78]This game seemed really cute and great.
[384:03.26]Yeah, my first impressions of it for playing it for six and a half hours are... I don't care that much about the game as much as I care about the relationship between the two characters.
[384:16.86]Like, I care more about this animal than I do about what the next puzzle in the game is.
[384:23.45]So, it has me.
[384:24.93]It's... Oh, sorry.
[384:26.09]There.
[384:27.25]It's definitely got me.
[384:28.61]I definitely care about it.
[384:29.89]But, like, the video game, The Last Guardian, I kind of don't give a shit about.
[384:34.43]I care about, like, these two characters, which I guess is the point of the whole game.
[384:37.76]That's, like, the game, The Last Guardian.
[384:43.54]But, was it worth waiting for?
[384:47.17]I think so.
[384:48.29]I just don't know what the ending is.
[384:50.43]I don't know what's left for the next like six to five, maybe like five and a half hours.
[384:56.90]But I'm sure we'll find out.
[384:59.56]Because I will probably finish this on stream on Thursday.
[385:05.30]I'll let you guys know.
[385:07.07]But there'll probably be an off-schedule stream tomorrow night.
[385:09.95]I have sort of decided that I was going to do an off-schedule tomorrow.
[385:16.83]I won't swear or make jokes in the stream.
[385:19.09]I did say that.
[385:21.49]But, in the meantime, guys, thanks for sticking around.
[385:25.02]Hopefully you enjoyed the stream.
[385:26.76]Hopefully you enjoyed The Last Guardian.
[385:29.38]If you like what you saw and you think you'd want to play it and you think somebody else... This is the kind of game where you would want to show this people.
[385:34.70]You know what I mean?
[385:36.20]You would want to show this to people.
[385:38.02]If you've got like a friend or you've got like a girlfriend or like a buddy of yours or somebody that would watch you play this game...
[385:44.43]You're going to have a ton of fun, because you know when all the cool shit happens, and you know you want to see their reactions and stuff.
[385:49.60]Plus, giant bird cat dog that's adorable, and is really, really awesome.
[385:56.00]But yeah, good night.
[385:56.54]I want to say, before I go, thank you to AustinS601 for six months.
[386:02.75]Is there something wrong with your dog?
[386:05.47]His glowing antenna should be a healthy yellow.
[386:09.33]Well, he is... I don't even know what kind of combination... He's got like the bird feet, so he's not really a dog.
[386:14.98]Thank you BluePundit for two months.
[386:16.24]CaptainMain for the new sub.
[386:18.68]MooseOnTheLoose for three months.

[386:23.94]Thanks a lot, Funky.
[386:24.74]Welcome.
[386:27.16]I believe that is the Funky of video making fame.
[386:30.68]Potentially.
[386:31.68]But thanks a lot, Funky.
[386:32.68]Welcome.

[386:47.00]And we had some bits.
[386:49.36]Never Trust a Purple had a thousand bits.
[386:50.94]There were some hundreds put in there, too.
[386:53.78]Here is a blip.
[386:55.09]Thank you, Grump Club.
[386:57.41]Uh, Insociant.
[386:58.87]Insociant.
[387:00.61]195 bits.
[387:00.91]Thank you.
[387:03.25]And with that, we are gonna call it a night.
[387:07.91]Can you... Yeah, you wanna see the real dog?
[387:09.24]Alright.
[387:09.72]Before I go.
[387:10.92]So, expect potentially for me to finish this on stream over the next couple days.
[387:15.72]I'll let you know beforehand if that's not the case, but it should be.
[387:21.26]Let's get a dog cam before we go.
[387:22.78]My dog.
[387:24.98]My little cute dog.
[387:27.34]Why can't he be as big as this dog?
[387:30.68]Get that set.
[387:32.74]And good night, guys.
[387:35.90]Have a good rest of your night.
[387:41.03]I don't.
[387:42.13]I don't.
[387:44.01]I don't.
[387:46.63]Hey.
[387:47.57]Hey.
[387:49.37]Hey, can you say bye?
[387:50.07]Oh, no.
[387:55.58]He's a little too tired.
[387:56.72]I gotta get him one of those barrels.
[387:59.61]Yeah.
[387:59.79]Good night, guys.
[388:01.93]See you later.
