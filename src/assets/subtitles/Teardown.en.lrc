[00:01.19]What's up?
[00:03.31]How's everybody doing?
[00:10.59]Disable slug pug.
[00:11.76]That's the first thing you're gonna say to me?
[00:14.00]Right when I get back?
[00:15.82]The first thing you're gonna say?
[00:18.10]Not Jerma.
[00:19.22]Oh, how are you?
[00:20.84]Jerma, what's up, man?
[00:22.84]Jerma, how you been?
[00:29.25]No, I'm not gonna delete it.
[00:31.05]Not for a while.
[00:33.13]Look, here's what's gonna happen.
[00:34.27]I'm gonna let Slugpog get to the point of the seagull saving.
[00:38.39]Where it was a little funny thing that was enabled for an hour.
[00:42.42]And then... Became something that lasted two years.
[00:47.82]And now I can't delete it.
[00:52.28]Because now deleting it is... I mean, what about all the people that saved all those seagulls?
[00:58.80]Now, a year from now, when I delete Slugpog, or I even mention the notion that I'm going to delete Slugpog, there's going to be a bunch of Slugpog enthusiasts that are going to be pissed that I'm even questioning that.
[01:14.02]Don't let it multiply.
[01:15.20]Just wait till Slugpog X2 is made.
[01:23.84]And then Slugpog X3, and then Slugpog X4, until it's like Slugpog X100.
[01:28.52]And it's just a bunch of fucked up pixels on the screen.
[01:39.33]Are you feeling better?
[01:39.95]Yeah, I'm feeling a little better.
[01:42.57]For those of you that don't know, I didn't plan on not streaming this almost whole week.
[01:48.30]VR kind of shut me down for a few days.
[01:50.86]And then I got like stomach problems in the middle of that.
[01:53.89]So it was kind of a double whammy.
[01:54.97]But I'm here now.
[02:02.01]We're going to be playing Teardown today.
[02:03.31]Yeah, it's been recommended a lot.
[02:05.59]And it looks really good.
[02:06.87]Now, this might end up being a scenario where my computer.
[02:10.61]This is your computer good enough stream again, like the third stream in a row.
[02:18.57]President elect Anthony Banthony.
[02:21.71]You know, I saw that image and I thought it was funny.
[02:24.21]But the one thing that I didn't like, I should have lost my hometown.
[02:28.86]I should have lost Massachusetts.
[02:30.34]Because like, I'm from there.
[02:32.38]And everyone fucking hates me from there.
[02:35.20]Like, it's the only people that truly know me.
[02:38.53]And I've somehow convinced the rest of the country.
[02:41.77]That I'm this good person.
[02:43.89]Or like, I'm a good policy maker.
[02:45.45]Massachusetts is just done.
[02:48.89]The complete opposite.
[02:52.86]Or like Hawaii or something.
[02:54.04]Somehow the Hawaiians just know.
[03:02.36]You are a bad politician.
[03:03.84]Yeah, but about running for office.
[03:04.92]I thought that I never will.
[03:07.38]You want to talk about me running for office?
[03:12.42]Look, my mother has asked me before.
[03:15.74]She's like, you know, you should like run for like a local office or something.
[03:21.76]You can get up on the podium.
[03:22.79]You can be well-spoken.
[03:23.85]You have some great ideas.
[03:29.48]And I'm just thinking, like, mom, you don't even understand.
[03:31.00]Like, the first thing I would do is I would erect, like, 15 bologna factories.
[03:36.37]We would have a bologna-based economy in Las Vegas.
[03:39.97]That would be bad.
[03:40.67]I don't think it would be a good idea for me.
[03:42.09]For the world and the country.
[03:44.84]But if I were to actually run for president or run for senator or something, sure, you guys would think it was funny.
[03:51.61]And a bunch of you might actually vote for me.
[03:53.29]Most of you wouldn't because it's like, holy shit, no.
[03:56.33]I'm gonna vote for like an e-clown meme machine over a guy that's a politician that knows what he's doing?
[04:03.98]You would make the joke and maybe like a thousand of you would actually vote for me.
[04:08.26]But can you imagine the dirt?
[04:10.56]Can you imagine the ad campaigns?
[04:13.53]There's so many clips of me saying insane, awful shit.
[04:18.15]I've talked about, like, shitting my pants.
[04:19.51]I've talked about, like, shitting in my own mouth.
[04:21.31]I've talked about, like, I've, like, hit myself in the face.
[04:24.21]I've talked about, like, eating, like, biting the dentist's hand and shit.
[04:27.81]Like, I don't, I've said some crazy things.
[04:33.50]All they need to do is just play an unedited stream.
[04:37.10]And I would lose all, the whole country.
[04:47.38]It just has to be an unedited stream.
[04:49.80]And the first time that I turned over and I was like, what did you say?
[04:52.66]Hey, uh, did it remind me of something?
[04:54.83]I was on the Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru and I got double, uh, two, just my demeanor is not good enough.
[05:10.95]You would have won in 2016.
[05:11.79]Okay.
[05:17.32]Not anymore.
[05:17.90]Oh, he's getting political.
[05:31.55]No, I'm not getting political.
[05:32.97]This is just what's going on right now in the world.
[05:36.14]This is one of the most volatile elections in American fucking history.
[05:44.00]Okay, look, if me not even mentioning the election right now is as if a fucking meteor on camera landed behind me.
[05:53.98]And it was like... And like a fucking smoke cloud took over the camp.
[05:59.09]And I'm sitting there playing Teardown like, oh man, what's that?
[06:03.35]Oh, did you guys see what I picked up?
[06:06.17]And you hear like...
[06:11.03]I guess maybe the wind outside is getting a little weird.
[06:28.31]I think I can use this in my inventory somewhere.
[06:31.77]It's getting a little hot in here and like the fucking heat is just going in my window and I'm like sweating and like red.
[06:39.50]I'm sweating in here.
[06:40.60]AC, Las Vegas sure is hot and dry this time of year.
[06:48.76]Of course.
[06:50.84]The election was literally decided an hour ago.
[06:56.12]Well, the projections were decided.
[06:58.50]I can't turn the stream on and be like, hey, everybody, don't worry about that.
[07:06.80]Jeb won.
[07:11.55]Jeb.
[07:11.99]Imagine you turned on TV and it was like, and ladies and gentlemen, the president-elect Jeb Bush has been elected president.
[07:20.58]I'd probably just be like, yeah, I guess that makes sense for 2020, doesn't it?
[07:25.74]Like, what happened?
[07:32.65]I'd be like, alright, whatever.
[07:34.51]Bring on 2021, let's go.
[07:37.83]They should have clapped.
[07:38.81]That's a millennial joke.
[07:41.56]It's like fucking four years ago.
[07:47.34]Wait.
[07:48.64]So what would have... I'm confused.
[07:50.32]What do you mean that's a millennial joke?
[07:52.64]Wait, we have boomer jokes.
[07:55.24]Now we're saying LOL millennial joke.
[08:01.39]Now... So wait, the zoomers have taken over now.
[08:03.59]Uh-oh.
[08:10.46]Zoomers have taken over, because now it's like, okay, millennial.
[08:12.73]Because, like, we say, you know, as millennials, okay, boomer.
[08:15.89]Now it's, okay, LOL, millennial.
[08:19.81]Uh-oh.
[08:21.19]Uh-oh.
[08:22.27]I'm getting too old.
[08:23.29]Uh-oh.
[08:25.09]I am now one tier above who is considered annoying to the last generation.
[08:31.30]Uh-oh.
[08:32.80]Uh-oh.
[08:40.93]Dinky.
[08:47.91]I did kind of say that was pretty close, you're right.
[08:50.51]But I will say, regardless of how you feel about the election, aren't you just happy that this shit's gonna be over with soon?
[09:01.30]Like, I'm fucking so happy.
[09:03.66]Like, can we breathe, like, a collective sigh of relief at this point that, okay, can we just, like, move the fuck on?
[09:10.15]Please.
[09:17.69]And I know this, look, I know over the next couple of months it's going to be kind of wild.
[09:22.86]But with, like, coronavirus, economic uncertainty, presidential elections, Trump, Biden...
[09:31.45]Can you imagine being on the highway in 2021?
[09:35.13]And you get to look in the rearview mirror in like the summer of 2021.
[09:40.41]And like the fucking world is on fire in your rearview mirror.
[09:43.69]And you're just like, holy shit.
[09:45.19]I'm on the road still.
[09:45.85]This is good.
[09:46.75]Whoa.
[09:47.79]That's back there.
[09:48.37]What's ahead of us?
[09:49.75]And it's just like big fucking beautiful clouds and rainbows.
[09:54.21]And there's like flying unicorns and shit.
[10:00.92]Once we get over the coronavirus, we get over all the, like, the heated political shit.
[10:08.16]That's optimistic.
[10:09.14]Well, I want to be optimistic.
[10:10.58]Why?
[10:10.70]You don't want to be?
[10:11.40]I don't want to.
[10:12.05]Woody, why don't we just sit here and be like, yeah, can't wait for 2021 for the whole world to collapse and everybody fucking just gets wiped out.
[10:21.55]No.
[10:21.79]This is a Doomer stream.
[10:29.88]Economic Andy?
[10:35.89]What the fuck?
[10:42.10]Zoomer boomer doomer.
[10:45.99]That's fucked.
[10:46.85]Look, okay.
[10:47.73]I actually had a conversation with the mods about this before I started the stream.
[10:50.25]Because look, I haven't been live since the election happened.
[10:53.53]Since they even started counting votes.
[10:55.39]Which, by the way, if I have to fucking hear the words Democratic Stronghold one more time, I'm gonna eat a glass bottle.
[11:07.01]If I hear the words, you know, we're still counting.
[11:09.65]The count's coming in.
[11:10.27]You see, these are all real people.
[11:11.67]These are people.
[11:12.25]We're not saying they're not people.
[11:14.25]We're still counting.
[11:15.19]And this can change.
[11:15.99]It absolutely can change.
[11:17.11]But the president, obviously, is seeing some trouble here.
[11:20.24]But we're still counting.
[11:21.46]We're counting.
[11:24.22]Eight-minute news cycle.
[11:25.52]Eight-minute news cycle.
[11:26.58]See you in eight minutes for the eight-minute news cycle.
[11:28.32]We're still counting.
[11:29.10]Let's take a look at this county.
[11:32.38]Democratic strong... No, stop.
[11:33.53]Stop.
[11:38.59]Nevada, Omeglel.
[11:39.85]Yeah, I know.
[11:40.65]They just shut the lights off like four days ago.
[11:49.93]We have... Nevada is ready for the election.
[11:54.81]But we're only going to be counting votes between 4 a.m.
[11:58.91]and 11 a.m.
[12:01.35]And then we're shutting the fucking lights off and everybody goes home for three days.
[12:08.48]Were you counting the votes by yourself?
[12:10.14]Yeah, that's where I was.
[12:12.90]That's where I've been.
[12:14.07]I saw that video, by the way.
[12:19.07]Political, political.
[12:20.21]Of course I'm gonna get a little political.
[12:22.95]Look, like I told you, the meteor is currently crashing.
[12:27.43]It crashed at Earth.
[12:28.61]I have to tell you about the meteor for five minutes before the stream starts.
[12:32.57]Come on, I live here.
[12:36.02]I live in Nevada and we're currently like the butt of every political joke in the sphere of politics.
[12:43.57]I have to address, I have to defend my domain, okay?
[12:47.47]Look.
[12:48.99]Nevada's like 50 in education.
[12:53.56]Out of the 50 states.
[12:55.70]Let me defend this.
[12:59.28]This is literally the worst.
[13:05.94]Hey, but let me tell you something.
[13:07.66]We have, in Nevada, we've got one of the most up and coming strong economies.
[13:13.20]Our infrastructure is like top five in the country.
[13:16.84]Our economic growth outlook is pretty good.
[13:20.89]We are number four in the country for infrastructure.
[13:24.53]Did you know that?
[13:26.33]Number four in the country.
[13:29.31]We've got the beautiful roads, bridges, structures.
[13:33.41]We have such good structural integrity.
[13:37.08]We just can't count very high.
[13:43.56]Once you get past a thousand, you need like 30 more people.
[13:47.32]All count to a thousand and one.
[13:56.42]Jerma 2024.
[13:57.20]You see, I could think about it.
[13:58.98]Think about me on the stage right now going, I just said fucking no more taxes.
[14:05.39]That's it.
[14:05.71]I don't say anything else.
[14:06.39]I have no other policies.
[14:07.29]I'm gonna take a sip, and I take a sip.
[14:17.26]I pulled from underneath the podium.
[14:19.24]A sip of a Bud Red.
[14:22.60]And, like, the crowd's just like, What the fuck?
[14:31.07]And then I do like one of those fucking gross side burp muffles.
[14:34.99]Where you go like... Your like cheek fills up and it goes out the right side of your mouth really quickly.
[14:50.53]What?
[14:50.89]How does that start?
[14:51.49]Alright.
[14:52.52]Look, it's been 15 minutes.
[14:53.56]I talked about the meteor.
[14:56.10]I talked about the smoking meteor that's in the backyard.
[15:00.58]I get, I know where the people are on edge right now.
[15:03.90]I know, I get it.
[15:04.64]I've been watching the news and flipping between channels to see like what the fuck's even happening.
[15:10.85]I get it, I get it.
[15:12.71]But I'm gonna play a children's fucking Lego game, okay?
[15:24.13]Play the game, funny man.
[15:26.49]And another thing.
[15:39.38]Go home.
[15:42.02]What is Otto's stance?
[15:45.57]Uh, Otto was one of, like, the 8,000 people that voted for Kanye West.
[15:56.53]Hey, by the way, I think Mickey Mouse got more write-in votes than Kanye West got real votes.
[16:03.24]I feel like that's real.
[16:08.67]Oh, that's pretty sick.
[16:14.59]Somebody said, poor Kanye.
[16:18.67]I think he's gonna be just fine, by the way.
[16:23.01]Damn, that was cool.
[16:23.91]Alright.
[16:31.35]A few tools.
[16:33.16]We have an extinguisher.
[16:38.71]Ooh.
[16:43.39]I love this thing.
[16:44.59]This is awesome.
[16:45.51]It's just like, it's like a marshmallow sprayer.
[16:50.04]Why is there an extinguisher?
[16:51.08]Alright, sludge hammer.
[16:59.87]You're supposed to be able to break everything in this game.
[17:02.23]Oh, you can.
[17:03.53]Wait.
[17:05.77]This is my house.
[17:06.35]Why would I be doing this to my house?
[17:08.73]I got my sludge hammer.
[17:09.99]I got my spray can.
[17:11.19]Replace the fuse to turn on the power.
[17:13.73]You can paint?
[17:14.29]Does it all... How do I switch colors?
[17:18.41]Does it all have to be Halloween orange?
[17:23.06]Dude, the Homewrecker.
[17:26.00]This is my favorite one.
[17:26.86]Did I just smash the desk?
[17:34.12]I just heard electricity noises.
[17:38.25]Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[17:42.69]I can't help it.
[17:43.47]If everything's breakable, I'm going to do it.
[17:45.01]There goes the toilet.
[17:45.73]This is a bad game for me to play.
[17:47.13]Luigi's Mansion, I can't play it.
[17:48.85]This is Luigi's Mansion.
[17:51.43]Wait, did I just steal money out of a safe?
[17:54.29]There's a bunch of gold bars in here.
[17:55.78]Oh wait, no, that's fire.
[18:08.00]Replace the fuse.
[18:12.69]Dude, this is cool.
[18:15.69]This is actually pretty cool.
[18:19.41]He'd hammer his own children.
[18:21.09]Okay, that's really like just a fucked up thing to say.
[18:28.04]Switch gear station, okay.
[18:31.14]Replace the fuse.
[18:32.32]Alright, fuse is on.
[18:34.16]If I hit this, it's gonna explode.
[18:37.45]No.
[18:38.21]Alright, I'm telling you right now.
[18:40.43]Not even for a million dollars.
[18:41.75]If you said, hey dude, I'll give you one million dollars if you take this sledgehammer and you swing it really hard at this electrical grid.
[18:48.74]I'd be like, nah dude, I'm sorry.
[18:52.42]No, I wouldn't do it.
[18:53.54]No fucking way.
[18:55.82]I wouldn't even do it for ten million.
[18:57.12]It would be too scary because it would just explode and kill you.
[19:04.05]Go inside and check messages.
[19:08.89]$10 million.
[19:09.91]No, because what?
[19:10.87]The chance that you do that and you just, the metal from the sledgehammer just instantly sends like 50,000 volts into you and you just explode into a splatter of blood and guts like that would probably happen.
[19:23.44]Gas bill.
[19:25.60]Gas bill just dropped on the floor.
[19:27.56]Honestly, I'm not sure we can make it through the month.
[19:31.00]Are you getting any requests?
[19:31.92]At this point, we pretty much have to accept anything.
[19:33.64]Be creative.
[19:34.28]From mom.
[19:34.56]Jesus.
[19:36.86]Jesus.
[19:39.72]This just came in.
[19:40.30]Sound kind of fishy, but we need the money.
[19:42.24]You up for it?
[19:43.80]Good evening, my name is Gordon.
[19:46.07]Uh, general manager at the Evertides Mall.
[19:48.75]I have a slight problem with an old building that's blocking our plans for a new wing, and I need someone to knock it over.
[19:54.71]I need it gone by tomorrow, and I'd even be willing to pay more than the standard rate for some extra discretion.
[20:01.50]Quick execution in uncomfortable working hours.
[20:05.08]Would you be able to take care of it?
[20:08.73]Is this England?
[20:09.75]Where is this?
[20:11.37]What country is this?
[20:12.35]Is this fucking Northrend?
[20:13.68]Where are we?
[20:16.76]Is this a made-up country?
[20:20.72]Lockhell.
[20:22.50]Lockhell what?
[20:24.74]It's Finland?
[20:26.58]Oh, okay.
[20:27.91]This would be a pretty sick Warcraft map, don't you think?
[20:29.91]This is like where a raid would be.
[20:34.24]Like, you don't actually get to go over here.
[20:35.93]You just get to go look at it for a second and get instanced into the raid.
[20:38.85]Fucking stupid, by the way.
[20:39.99]Let me explore the cool area.
[20:41.19]I don't want to get instanced into your bullshit yet.
[20:43.37]Uh, alright, what are we doing?
[20:46.63]Right.
[20:47.17]Evertide's Mall.
[20:48.71]The old building problem.
[20:51.88]An upscale shopping center by the waterfront managed by Gordon Wu.
[20:54.96]Also in the area is Lockhell Municipality Folk Museum.
[20:57.68]Alright, so we just have to destroy the building.
[21:00.14]An old building's blocking Gordon's plans for a new wing at the mall.
[21:02.96]Is somebody in there?
[21:07.32]Oh, wait.
[21:08.12]It didn't say that there's nobody in the house.
[21:11.45]The old building problem.
[21:16.61]What?
[21:16.81]Okay.
[21:19.59]Escape.
[21:21.03]Why escape?
[21:21.73]You need to clear all the targets first.
[21:24.15]We need to clear the targets.
[21:30.44]Highly explosive propane tank.
[21:34.88]Oh my god, okay, wait, they didn't do anything.
[21:42.91]Wait, wait, wait, just do it just like, um, just like in Jenga.
[21:46.43]If somebody ever asks you to play Jenga and you don't want to play, just deliberately take out, like, the two or three bottom rows, secretly, while you pretend to play at the top row.
[21:55.58]And then it'll be over, and you'll be like, oh no, you got Jenga!
[21:58.52]Alright, now put the fucking thing away and don't take it out for another five years.
[22:09.63]Look at this.
[22:12.09]It's still standing.
[22:12.75]Why?
[22:18.12]Go down.
[22:19.50]What?
[22:26.40]Oh, the fucking chimney is holding the whole thing up.
[22:28.14]Alright, let's blow up the chimney.
[22:38.63]Come on, blow it up!
[22:50.56]Is this not working?
[22:51.32]Use a bulldozer.
[22:55.00]What?
[23:00.27]Are you fucking kidding me?
[23:05.65]Shovel.
[23:06.63]Left mouse button, right mouse button.
[23:11.24]It's a full letter grade, yeah?
[23:12.10]Alright, get this out of the way.
[23:18.97]I love this game already.
[23:20.47]Okay.
[23:21.29]Dig it out.
[23:21.71]Alright, lift it up.
[23:30.41]No, wait, wait, wait.
[23:30.89]Why don't you just do this?
[23:35.77]That's so much easier.
[23:40.96]You saw somebody doing this?
[23:45.93]I guess, I guess that works.
[23:53.49]This is just what happens when somebody rents one of these.
[23:57.85]To like move their pool.
[24:00.58]No, I can do it.
[24:01.64]I can do it.
[24:02.14]I don't need to hire a company.
[24:03.30]I'm almost at the pool.
[24:12.18]Alright, lift it up.
[24:13.62]Why is it stuck?
[24:19.56]Why is it stuck?
[24:23.58]Dig out that chimney!
[24:27.43]How do I get rid of the chimney?
[24:30.73]Get out.
[24:35.27]Fall!
[24:37.11]Why would- Fall!
[24:41.03]Fall!
[24:43.82]Ball!
[24:46.62]Wrong house?
[24:47.22]No, it's not.
[24:57.40]What do you mean wrong house?
[25:01.84]It's the wood one.
[25:05.80]Yeah, bullshit.
[25:06.94]I know.
[25:07.52]Okay, let's get this.
[25:09.36]This is so cool.
[25:10.12]Alright, I gotta calm down.
[25:12.70]Is it a fire extinguisher?
[25:13.84]Or a... No, this is just a children's drawing of a Minecraft creeper.
[25:18.32]And it's hung up on the fridge.
[25:23.00]Oh, it's a stove.
[25:23.72]Does this explode?
[25:28.53]I swear to God, this is just what rich people do when they're done with the house they live in.
[25:33.03]They just smoke a fucking bunch of crack and then they just destroy their house for fun.
[25:42.18]They just do coke until they can't see anymore and then they just destroy their house.
[25:50.58]Read the sign.
[25:52.06]We're not fucking reading.
[25:52.94]Who wants to read?
[25:53.62]The fuck did I throw that with my bare hands?
[26:06.83]Okay.
[26:11.03]Oh, more explosives.
[26:18.03]Oh, sorry, whoever that was.
[26:26.04]Right there, there's a weak point.
[26:30.86]Alright, now let's fuck this thing up.
[26:35.38]Somebody pulls over.
[26:40.59]Excuse me, is everything okay over here?
[26:42.81]Yeah, don't worry, man.
[26:44.51]We're just really rich.
[26:46.74]Oh, okay, okay, have a nice day!
[26:48.04]Alright, let's do this, let's do this, let's do this in the right system.
[27:07.93]Go up.
[27:09.45]All the way up.
[27:10.41]And then we're gonna clasp down.
[27:12.01]Ready?
[27:15.07]Ready?
[27:18.65]Goes through the roof.
[27:19.37]Yes!
[27:21.97]Rip it apart.
[27:26.85]Is this a Mr. Beast video?
[27:32.76]Yeah, but the only difference is Mr. Beast would do this to somebody's house without them knowing.
[27:39.40]And they'd show up and be like, Mr. Beast, what the fuck did you do to my house?! !
[27:44.35]Don't worry, I bought you a million dollar house, and it's two miles down the road.
[27:49.41]And they'd be like, wait, what the fuck did you do?
[27:56.81]What about all the pictures in the attic of my grandparents?
[28:00.41]Ah, you don't need those anymore.
[28:02.12]You've got a two million dollar house.
[28:05.32]Oh, thanks, I guess.
[28:15.54]Mr. Beast video.
[28:17.99]Dude, okay, I saw a Mr. Beast video.
[28:21.77]Before.
[28:23.09]Where he had, like, a bunch of fireworks people, and they blew up, like, nuclear bomb-like fireworks out somewhere.
[28:31.61]I saw, like, the fireworks Mr. Beast video, and I was like, holy shit, man.
[28:37.83]What?
[28:38.83]How are they- where are you doing this?
[28:44.81]It's like, oh, this firework is $150,000 and we have like four fire departments here with us.
[28:49.68]It's like, what?
[28:54.84]Was it in Nevada?
[28:55.66]Alright, I did it.
[29:00.34]I won.
[29:07.05]FOV?
[29:07.77]Too small?
[29:08.81]Probably.
[29:09.17]Let's go with like $100,000.
[29:15.74]That's a little better.
[29:23.39]No, I don't think I could ever do a MrBeast video.
[29:25.53]I don't think I could swing on a swing set until I piss my pants and make 10 grand.
[29:28.35]I'm not sure I could do that.
[29:29.69]Like, for 24 hours.
[29:37.74]I don't think I'd be able to do it.
[29:41.72]He does have... Look, alright.
[29:42.70]He does have some crazy fucking videos, though.
[29:47.70]I saw another one where he, like, slimed his brother's house.
[29:50.98]They, like, filled his entire brother's house with slime.
[29:53.20]I'm just like, imagine being one of this person's fucking neighbors.
[29:57.93]Every window of every floor, green slime is shooting out of it.
[30:01.61]And it's like, did you just, like, drop my property value by, like, 50 grand by doing what you just did?
[30:06.73]Imagine, like, looking over the fence and being like, okay, um, I, uh, is it time to sell?
[30:24.23]Less taxes though, woohoo.
[30:26.13]Ah, turn it off!
[30:31.24]Look at this bed.
[30:31.82]Look at this little Minecraft bed.
[30:33.94]This looks like a person sleeping here.
[30:35.28]This is like a person just lying down on their back.
[30:45.35]Wait, don't I need this stuff?
[30:47.51]I feel like I need this stuff.
[30:51.22]Isn't this my house?
[30:52.16]Why would I be... Why am I MrBeast-ing my own house?
[31:01.59]Okay.
[31:05.23]Oh, how much money did I get?
[31:05.99]This just came in.
[31:10.14]Sound kind of fishy.
[31:10.80]Got it.
[31:11.06]Cool.
[31:12.42]Cool.
[31:16.62]Investigation.
[31:17.84]Oh, what a morning.
[31:19.84]Shouldn't have taken that job.
[31:21.01]I knew something wasn't right.
[31:22.25]That building was under cultural heritage protection, and the demolition is now part of a criminal investigation.
[31:27.85]What?
[31:28.73]Mr. Turdy Man at the police just sent me this photo.
[31:35.15]They must have caught you on a traffic camera heading towards the mall.
[31:38.69]The very last thing we need right now is an investigation.
[31:40.59]I tried sweet-talking her, and she thought she could get the case dropped.
[31:43.69]I don't know what she wants.
[31:45.21]Just do it.
[32:00.83]that's pretty oh my god this is terrible what I I did this going to police the perpetrators did a quick job on the old building
[32:21.88]Oh, right.
[32:22.42]I would have a TV that's indestructible.
[32:29.51]So to wipe my record clean, I have to do a favor?
[32:32.19]Just so you know, I don't usually do this, but I'm stuck on a case and I feel like I should try something new.
[32:36.50]I've been investigating Lawrence Lee Jr.
[32:38.26]over tax evasion for months now, but he has so many friends in town that I can't get a warrant.
[32:44.14]How about you use your skills to borrow the computers over at Lee Chemicals so that I can finally access his customer registry and sort this mess out?
[32:53.89]If you do this for me, I'll make sure your little blunder will be forgotten.
[32:59.35]Lee computers.
[33:02.47]Lee chemicals.
[33:03.43]Okay.
[33:09.27]Marissa wants access to Lee's customer registry.
[33:11.37]Pick up three computers at the site for her.
[33:13.52]Okay.
[33:13.80]Pick up three computers.
[33:14.90]Don't destroy the building, right?
[33:16.02]But that's... I can't... I'm going to every single one of these... I'm going to be on the news every day.
[33:26.72]First tab to toggle map and objectives.
[33:28.52]Ooh, that's cool.
[33:31.24]That's very much appreciated.
[33:32.38]Okay.
[33:35.37]Security.
[33:35.71]There's a fire alarm?
[33:36.71]Large fires will trigger the fire alarm.
[33:40.31]Shit.
[33:40.59]Alright.
[33:40.93]There's a computer right in here.
[33:43.21]Is this illegal for me to be here?
[33:46.19]Am I, like, not allowed to be at Lee's chemical plant?
[33:49.36]There's no security besides fire, right?
[33:52.02]Okay.
[34:00.98]There's one.
[34:01.24]Where's the other one?
[34:08.81]Right here?
[34:09.17]Okay.
[34:17.96]Uh, where is it?
[34:20.22]Right ahead?
[34:20.68]Okay.

[34:57.03]How about I walk down the stairs?
[34:58.01]Oh.

[35:04.35]Bullshit.
[35:11.05]Wait.
[35:11.77]Go in the attic.
[35:16.20]That's it.
[35:16.52]There's illegal stuff in the attic.
[35:17.80]Right.
[35:23.85]How do I get in the attic?
[35:25.87]Oh, up here.
[35:26.35]Alright, this is the attic.
[35:31.49]How do I get up to the attic?
[35:33.63]Alright.
[35:35.33]I'm almost there.
[35:35.83]Alright, I'm in the attic.
[35:39.65]I just got Lee's tax-deductible pension.
[35:44.92]Nice.
[35:45.18]That's it.
[35:49.34]Alright, cool.
[35:52.84]Alright, on to the next one.

[36:05.31]Okay, so bang a right.
[36:06.43]Okay.

[36:28.68]There's a building.
[36:30.22]Drive straight.

[36:42.28]What?
[36:44.62]Oh, shit.
[36:45.00]Nice.
[36:45.52]That gigantic explosive.
[36:47.34]Don't break this.
[36:54.12]Okay, I gotta go up there.
[36:56.13]Oh, that's easy.
[37:01.03]Bingo, we're done.
[37:02.35]Wait, any more things to steal?
[37:05.85]Yep, coffee maker.

[37:44.22]No, that's not part of the job.
[37:54.90]That's it.
[37:58.08]Raise every other building.
[37:59.42]No, I want a bunch of money.
[38:06.84]Raise all.
[38:08.61]Alright, I promise I'll destroy the next one.

[40:22.86]Oh, no way, kids!
[40:27.24]I would be so much fun.
[40:30.60]Right, well, but I guess...
[40:33.02]I guess that, uh, at like 6 o'clock in the morning, maybe you don't want to hear that.
[40:39.09]I guess that might be like a little annoying.
[40:44.61]Like, I'm tired.
[40:45.87]I don't want to hear a guy be like a clown on the PA system.
[40:49.56]But would I be able to like just jump in in the middle of the day?
[40:51.88]You know what I mean?
[40:53.92]Just be like,
[40:58.56]Students, students, hello, hello.
[41:00.64]It's me, here with an emergency announcement.
[41:04.14]Today, it's backwards words day.
[41:07.13]So when you talk to people, make sure you say your words backwards.
[41:10.81]Don't say emergency.
[41:16.17]Oh, right, yeah.
[41:17.19]Don't say emergency.
[41:21.24]That's not an emergency.
[41:30.15]thrown the fuck out immediately.
[41:33.17]You're like, yeah, you can only, like, pretend to do an emergency announcement for, like, a funny backwards words day thing before we take you out, and you've been removed, you've been fired.
[41:42.20]I would hate to fire me, though, wouldn't you?
[41:44.36]Wouldn't you hate to fire me?
[41:46.30]Because it'd be like, fuck, we just brought this guy in to, like, hype up the students and have fun, and, like, it's been three days, and we hate this fucking guy, and I have to- he's so positive, he's, like, so happy-
[41:56.83]He comes to work with, like, ready to go.
[41:59.61]He's got, like, a jumbo iced coffee from Dunkin' Donuts.
[42:02.53]And he's, like, ready to go for four hours straight, whatever we need him for.
[42:05.65]But you gotta go.
[42:06.45]Like, get the fuck out of here.
[42:09.01]I'd be like... No, over the PA system.
[42:13.23]I would want to do it over... I want to get fired over the PA system.
[42:15.97]So we could do this weird, like, drama.
[42:18.45]We could start, like, this weird, like, skit kind of drama where, like, the PA guy gets fired.
[42:25.52]Okay, if you guys in the morning, instead of the announcements, it was like drama between the teachers and the principals.
[42:34.08]Don't you think that would be like interesting?
[42:36.85]You knew it was made up, but it was like, you know, you, oh, my favorite teacher versus like this, like my, they're like inside of the, they're like arguing back and forth with like music behind them, like sad music or like intense music for a big argument.
[42:52.82]Yeah, it'd be like WWE.
[42:55.04]But there'd be no fighting.
[42:56.04]Just, like, arguments.
[42:57.08]It'd be a soap opera, yeah.
[43:04.89]PA announcer.
[43:09.29]Don't think you could do that in, uh... Don't think you could say that over the middle school PA system.
[43:13.89]Sorry.
[43:15.81]Or if there was fighting, you just heard, like... God damn it.
[43:35.32]Well, temperature regulation came up as a huge problem.

[47:09.37]If you... Think about that.
[47:10.75]If you knew that you were going to get that shit every day, people would get so into it.
[47:17.29]You would hate it.
[47:17.95]No way.
[47:18.63]There's no way.
[47:19.15]If, like, the teachers were pretending to, like... Actually, that would be... No, it would be fun.
[47:28.94]What did that even sound like?
[47:30.54]That would be cringe.
[47:32.76]Hold on, did that even sound the way that I wanted it to?
[47:36.70]Hold on a second.
[47:39.20]Did it?
[47:39.72]Yeah, no, that was fine.
[47:41.44]Except some of these people sounded really fucked up.
[47:47.90]You brute!
[47:50.49]It's not the father.
[47:51.45]No, you're not the father.
[47:53.17]That didn't sound right.
[47:54.57]That's not what I was going for.
[47:58.42]It's alright, though.
[48:00.83]It still works.
[48:01.41]Alright, I gotta play the video game again.
[48:05.21]I forgot.
[48:09.73]It's a World War II- You sounded like a ro- If a Roomba was a person.
[48:22.44]It was- I was trying to do pitch shifting, not like robot.
[48:25.78]Whatever, who cares.
[48:32.03]Ah, fuck.
[48:32.69]Alright, let's go.
[48:34.39]The customer registry indicates that Lee has worked almost exclusively with a single client recently.
[48:40.08]The client is only referred to as BET and no further details, so I really have to bother you with one more favor.
[48:49.66]Head back to Lee Chemicals and fetch their employee login devices.
[48:55.73]I should be able to cross-reference their log files with the delivery schedule to figure out where they are moving the product and what BT means.
[49:03.68]Install the new security system.
[49:04.86]Be careful.
[49:08.81]Pick up three login devices.
[49:10.65]They're protected by an alarm system.
[49:12.71]Security arrives 60 seconds after an alarm is triggered.
[49:17.68]Oh, shit.
[49:18.16]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[49:24.88]Alright, now there's new security.
[49:26.08]Does the camera show up?
[49:33.16]Wired alarm boxes.
[49:34.38]Breaking an alarm box or wire triggers the alarm.
[49:36.84]Okay.
[49:37.08]Is this an alarm box?
[49:40.84]Anti-theft protection system.
[49:43.64]Alright, so let's just jump over the fence.
[50:04.39]Wait.
[50:04.83]It's just a sign.
[50:09.70]It's locked.
[50:12.10]Go fucking ram it.
[50:13.52]Alright, I got through.
[50:14.14]Alright, where's the first one?
[50:18.46]Up here.
[50:18.76]Alright, don't fuck anything up.
[50:19.78]Just go in normally.
[50:35.58]This is the one right here, right?
[50:36.46]No?
[50:37.56]No, it's the other building.
[50:38.84]Shit.
[50:39.08]Alright.
[50:48.28]Watch out for the security.
[50:52.88]Wait, can I shut down the security system?
[50:57.76]Dude, what is this?
[50:58.28]What's this?
[51:00.44]There's, like, cash under here.
[51:02.44]Hidden cash.
[51:03.22]What the fuck?
[51:04.05]Okay.
[51:04.47]Hidden cash.
[51:07.25]I'll give you 10 million.
[51:09.56]Give me it.
[51:10.56]Give me it.
[51:13.26]Free money.
[51:14.00]Free hidden... Okay, here we go.
[51:17.36]Is this open?
[51:20.23]Alright, wait.
[51:21.95]Can I just drive through this?
[51:33.87]Just break everything.
[51:35.03]No, but I don't want to break anything because there's a... That's bad now.
[51:39.76]They have security alarms everywhere.
[51:41.46]See, this is good.
[51:49.78]Go up top and then... There we go.
[51:52.69]Okay, this is a security alert here.
[51:56.83]How do I turn that off?
[52:06.93]Key card.
[52:07.87]Wait, hold on.
[52:09.69]Can I do this, like, in a row?
[52:17.55]Is one, two, three.
[52:25.91]Why don't I just drive into every building and just pick it up and run as fast as I can?
[52:29.49]Quick save.
[52:45.97]Go, go, go, go!
[52:52.09]Open the door, open, open, open, open, open, open, open, open, open, open!
[52:55.79]The door's locked.
[53:05.06]Shit!
[53:07.38]I didn't plan accordingly, I didn't plan accordingly.
[53:20.48]Use scroll wheel when clicking on doors.
[53:22.45]Oh shit, thanks.
[53:23.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[53:25.65]I gotta plan accordingly.
[53:26.57]So this is this one.
[53:28.25]There's one right across here.
[53:32.33]Let's make a plan.
[53:33.51]So if I jump out of here, I'm gonna jump from here into this building in front of me.
[53:39.91]From this building in front of me.
[53:42.01]No.
[53:43.67]I'm gonna jump to this pipe.
[53:47.13]I gotta get on that pipe.
[53:48.21]So if I go from here, jump to this pipe.
[53:52.66]Like this.
[53:54.56]Fucking idiot.
[53:55.26]How did you miss that?
[53:56.06]It's so easy.
[53:58.82]That gets me right here.
[53:59.90]Window.
[54:00.62]Through the window.
[54:03.68]It's in the back there.
[54:05.04]So I got two.
[54:07.38]Let's get that.
[54:07.96]Let's see if I can... Let's get that.
[54:16.97]Run it backwards?
[54:17.85]Yeah, yeah.
[54:18.15]I'm just going to get a good look.
[54:22.64]Okay.
[54:23.62]So that works too.
[54:24.26]Let's get through here.
[54:28.70]Whatever.
[54:32.93]They don't give a shit about this.
[54:37.11]So, up there, grab that one.
[54:39.59]Out to here.
[54:41.05]Get this one.
[54:42.81]And then through the pipe.
[54:47.50]Is there a window there?
[54:50.87]Okay, here we go.
[54:51.73]I got it.
[54:52.05]I got it.
[54:52.49]You ready?
[54:53.55]I'm ready.
[54:53.85]I'm ready.
[54:54.65]I'm ready.
[54:57.93]I'm ready.
[55:08.08]Work save.
[55:09.56]Use spray paint?
[55:12.08]Oh.
[55:12.92]Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
[55:14.41]We'll try that next time if I don't do it.
[55:18.25]In three, two, one.
[55:21.59]I tried to hold it.
[55:31.55]Fuck.
[55:33.27]Restart, restart, restart.
[55:34.61]I turned too quickly.
[55:36.83]I was holding right click and I turned too fast and hit the wall.
[55:55.71]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[55:58.17]Did it do it?
[56:02.68]What?!
[56:09.41]Sh- fuck!
[56:15.39]Was that the last one?
[56:33.13]Get me out!

[56:34.13]Fuck, I gotta- it's- I gotta do the other- I'm arrested.
[56:50.32]Why did the- I can't blow up the wall?
[56:52.30]What the fuck?
[56:52.78]What's the point of these things?
[56:53.70]Okay, here.
[56:56.73]Pipe.
[56:59.87]No, no, fuck that.
[57:04.64]Gotta get in here.
[57:08.68]Doing it backwards.
[57:09.26]Plan a route.
[57:11.72]Okay, where's my spray paint?
[57:15.11]So, I need to go in here.
[57:20.53]Let's just do, okay, in here.
[57:21.65]Okay.
[57:27.42]And then from here, we can go, is there a window there?
[57:37.13]Go right here.
[57:43.55]Don't go this way.
[57:44.31]Don't go this way.
[57:44.87]Don't go this way.
[57:45.33]This is wrong.
[57:45.81]This is wrong.
[57:48.28]How do I erase?
[57:49.40]How do I erase that?
[57:51.46]Alright, we'll go this way instead.
[57:57.30]That takes us to here.
[57:58.06]There's a window right there.
[58:01.62]Wait.
[58:04.58]Okay, hold on.
[58:12.37]So here, this is the window.

[62:16.96]How do I open this normally?
[62:47.66]Alright, let's fucking go.

[62:52.68]Are you really asking?
[63:00.70]How do I do this?
[63:01.50]Just drive through the fucking building.
[63:03.94]Done.
[63:04.18]Alright, this is it.

[63:20.51]And one, two,
[64:10.67]Go, Kari, please!
[64:17.93]You'll never catch me alive!
[64:19.53]11 minutes and 18 seconds.
[64:33.24]Cool.
[64:40.70]Amateur, you've reached a new rank.
[64:41.92]A new tool has been delivered.
[64:43.34]Are you fucking kidding me?
[64:46.03]What is it?
[64:48.25]Blowtorch.
[64:52.43]You can upgrade your tools in the computer terminal.
[64:58.51]How do you start fire?
[65:01.65]Why is my house fireproof?
[65:21.38]I love burning bricks.
[65:22.44]Alright, using it through metal.
[65:29.84]Oh, that's cool.
[65:35.26]That's a pretty good slug pog, if you ask me.
[65:37.00]Okay, tools.
[65:40.29]Sledge.
[65:41.85]No upgrades available.
[65:43.69]No upgrades... Oh, wait, hold on.
[65:46.15]Attribute.
[65:46.69]Short range tool causes medium damage.
[65:49.55]No upgrades.
[65:51.35]No upgrades.
[65:54.19]Oh, I think, yeah.
[65:55.47]Whatever.
[65:55.77]I maxed it out.
[65:58.27]Messages, okay.
[66:06.18]Uh, investigation.
[66:06.93]Didn't I already do this?
[66:08.11]Oh, right.
[66:09.07]Need coffee.
[66:12.37]They turned off the gas.
[66:13.67]I can't even make a proper coffee anymore.
[66:15.39]We really need to bring in more clients.
[66:16.77]I'll reach out to Gordon and see if he has something else.
[66:19.19]Haven't heard back from the police.
[66:20.51]That thing sorted?
[66:21.53]It's supposed to be.
[66:23.02]Thanks for helping me out with that building.
[66:27.14]The police was snooping around a little bit.
[66:30.10]But it seems to have cooled off now and we can finally start construction.
[66:33.48]I actually have another job for you.
[66:34.72]See, I bought this yacht recently and it's too large for the marina.
[66:41.72]I almost said marinara.
[66:43.08]And the board says there's no space for a new dock.
[66:47.05]Would you use your demolition skills again and remove one of the timeshare cabins?
[66:51.19]If the original documentation also disappeared, then ta-da.
[66:54.32]Like it was never there.
[66:55.14]Okay, so... Let's go.
[67:04.26]Make room for Gordon's new yacht at the marina by demolishing the outermost cabin.
[67:09.00]Destroy proof of ownership by dumping safes in the ocean.
[67:20.27]Alright, let's go.
[67:24.41]That's escape.
[67:26.97]I like the way this looks.
[67:30.46]The outermost cabin needs to be destroyed.
[67:34.07]There's a fire alarm, and large fires will trigger a fire alarm.
[67:37.97]Okay, outermost cabin.
[67:39.59]It's that one.
[67:43.80]Okay, there's the office.
[67:45.78]Safe is in there.
[67:46.46]Throw that shit in the ocean.
[67:48.08]Let's do that first.
[67:56.89]Does this steal the cash register from the window of, like, the fucking Dairy Queen?
[68:03.24]Why is it not detached?
[68:06.08]I'm taking the ketchup and mustard, too, and I'm throwing it in the ocean.
[68:08.16]I'm taking the cutting board.
[68:18.06]Actually, coming back from your break from work, and there's no sign of entering, but everything is gone, and the register is gone, too.
[68:28.55]Like, the register and the ketchup and mustard are gone.
[68:31.11]It's like... Okay.
[68:33.18]Oh, and the window's destroyed, too, I guess.
[68:39.26]Oh, can I get... Wait, glasses?
[68:42.56]I'm just stealing shit.
[68:45.58]That's, like, just fucking rude.
[68:48.00]This is just awful.
[68:48.98]Like, environmental damage.
[68:50.94]Why am I doing this?
[68:53.36]Sneak in the back.
[69:00.43]Anything else in here?
[69:02.47]Impressive mustard selection.
[69:06.33]Oops.
[69:16.12]Very sneaky.
[69:17.67]Yes, very sneaky.
[69:26.94]This place, this person doesn't, people really like that energy drink.
[69:29.92]Can I have one?
[69:30.92]Alright, let's move.
[69:40.96]Oh, there was a door the whole time.
[69:54.03]Okay.
[69:55.19]If you looked out your back window at that exact moment and there was a full wooden door that flew past your window into the water, what would you do?
[70:01.11]Alright, let's get- we're gonna steal the- we're gonna throw the safe in the ocean.
[70:09.73]Alright, I'm gonna be like the Grinch.
[70:21.01]Oh shit, that's 30 bucks.
[70:26.05]Oops.
[70:26.23]I was trying to open it.
[70:33.28]You're a wild one.
[70:34.64]Mr. Grinch.
[70:37.96]You're e... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[70:41.02]Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.
[70:42.52]No, no, no.
[70:42.88]You're supposed to just be stealing toys.
[70:52.75]Oh, foo.
[70:53.19]What is this?
[71:00.08]Valuables.
[71:01.82]It's in the desk.
[71:07.19]Shit, don't destroy all the lights.
[71:08.57]Then I can't see.
[71:10.31]Oh, thinking face.
[71:14.93]Expensive chairs.
[71:15.73]Expensive wood.
[71:16.75]Expensive... What's up?
[71:19.38]What about up here?
[71:19.86]Any, like, company secrets in here?
[71:28.42]Wait, get on the table.
[71:41.70]Nothing up here?
[71:42.10]Aww.
[71:43.42]Oh, I have a flashlight.
[71:45.80]Okay.
[71:46.33]That's helpful.
[71:46.77]There's nothing up here.
[71:47.35]Alright, I gotta get that safe.
[71:54.25]Safe is behind me in the room behind me.
[71:59.16]Alright, there's the safe.
[71:59.92]Throw the safe out the window.
[72:05.16]Into the ocean.
[72:05.66]Alright, where's the ocean?
[72:07.62]Alright, the ocean's right here.
[72:22.75]Okay, let's go.
[72:23.47]Into the ocean.
[72:23.91]This thing's heavy.
[72:27.41]Open it?
[72:42.30]Come on, open!
[72:48.97]Dammit, the safe is rated for fire.
[72:57.55]Whatever.
[72:57.86]You just welded it shut.
[73:03.49]Can I throw it?
[73:05.79]No, I can't throw it.
[73:06.45]I have to just dump it.
[73:09.46]Around the edges.
[73:42.21]Throw it overboard.
[73:43.71]Push.
[73:46.41]Get out of here.
[73:49.84]What's the optional thing?
[73:56.56]Warehouse safe?
[73:58.36]Oh, there's another fucking safe!
[74:00.97]Alright, let's go.
[74:13.17]There's a person?
[74:14.41]Where?
[74:16.43]I thought that was a person.
[74:17.41]You're right.
[74:17.77]I thought it was a person.
[74:19.91]I see a danger sign.
[74:20.99]Okay, don't do that.
[74:27.11]It was opening for me.
[74:27.99]Alright, where's the other safe?
[74:37.20]It's the wrong warehouse.
[74:54.21]Be careful, be careful.
[74:59.24]No, fuck it.
[74:59.76]I'm just gonna drive through.
[75:00.68]Who cares?
[75:01.84]Save the game?
[75:02.47]Okay, I got it.
[75:10.77]Forklift.
[75:11.87]Forklift, forklift, fork, fork, fork, fork.
[75:14.83]Forklift!
[75:25.23]Alright, then we gotta go all the way down in here.
[75:33.05]Forklift certified.
[75:34.23]Hypers.
[75:34.65]Alright, we're in.
[75:39.99]Wait, should I take the daddy forklift?
[75:41.81]Yeah.
[75:42.87]I don't want the baby forklift anymore.
[75:44.21]I want the daddy forklift.
[75:45.19]Alright, lift!
[76:00.85]There's the safe.
[76:01.39]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[76:02.51]I gotta put it on the forklift.
[76:08.27]Why can't this raise?
[76:08.87]Alright, here we go.
[76:09.90]Ready?
[76:10.54]Check this shit out.
[76:15.48]It's gonna be... I'm gonna get it right on the forklift.
[76:26.01]Got it.
[76:27.61]I got it, right?
[76:28.33]Okay, let's get it out.
[76:32.67]Shit.
[76:33.03]It's okay.
[76:42.24]There's too much shit all over the ground.
[76:46.56]We're just going out the easy way.
[76:48.82]Fuck.
[76:49.14]I can't get it.
[76:49.62]I can't throw it this way.
[76:50.62]It's alright.
[76:51.26]We'll drag it out here.
[77:14.61]Yeah!
[77:16.73]A nice perfect square.
[77:18.15]Dude, new emote incoming.
[77:24.73]jermaSlug Torch.
[77:38.81]Alright, be gone.
[77:40.27]Be gone with you.
[77:44.08]Into the ocean.
[77:48.90]Counts.
[77:49.68]It counts.
[77:50.82]It counts.
[77:51.36]Do I die if I go in the water?
[78:05.71]Whoa.
[78:12.04]That's on fire, that's on fire, that's on fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire!
[78:20.02]Just cover it in State Puff Marshmallow Man.
[78:25.52]Good.
[78:26.20]The State Puff Marshmallow Man saves the day again.
[78:38.47]Wait!
[78:39.43]There's probably hidden secret gems in here.
[78:41.49]Look at this.
[78:43.24]Are you serious?
[78:43.82]You don't think I'm going to do this?
[78:45.50]There's probably secret hidden gems over here.
[78:59.09]Come on.
[79:00.53]Secret gem?
[79:01.59]I see gems.
[79:02.03]No?
[79:03.65]That's just guts of the car.
[79:04.93]Really?
[79:08.26]Really?
[79:12.42]Is there a secret, like, rallyable in there?
[79:19.34]Wow, my computer can run this game.
[79:21.98]This is more optimized than Watch Dogs.
[79:26.70]This game, this thing is made by, like, four people.
[79:32.36]Every single thing in this game is a physics-based object.
[79:36.24]Every single thing in the whole game.
[79:42.90]and is running flawlessly.
[79:44.80]I open up the game Watch Dogs which had like a 500 trillion dollar budget and like a thousand people working on it.
[80:00.97]Whatever.
[80:01.27]I'll just drive the- I'll drive the go-kart.
[80:06.33]What is that?
[80:08.45]Why is there like water coming out of the car?
[80:13.66]Is that oil?
[80:14.36]I mean, it looks pretty sick, though, don't you think?
[80:16.94]Alright, we're gonna go back here.
[80:25.45]Alright, uh, there's the escape vehicle.
[80:39.92]There's the thing I have to destroy.
[80:40.98]Let's go.
[80:43.22]New car.
[80:44.71]New car.
[80:45.91]And this one's wet.
[80:50.53]It's fast, too.
[80:51.59]This is a fast car.
[80:55.33]Alright, which one do I have to destroy?
[81:06.45]Not that one.
[81:08.14]Not that one.
[81:09.36]Oh, get out!
[81:09.76]Get out!
[81:11.74]Sorry.
[81:16.91]Anybody home?
[81:22.62]Holy shit.
[81:23.94]What was that?
[81:24.44]This is free stuff in every house.
[81:36.13]What's this?
[81:36.59]Oh, nothing.
[81:42.97]Open this.
[81:44.29]Damn it.
[81:44.93]Everything's like a magic box of goodies.
[81:46.93]Did I just throw their bed out the window?
[81:51.49]Is that mean?
[81:53.47]That's kind of mean.
[81:56.67]Look, at this point, if you're going to do that, you might as well just go all in.
[82:00.83]And just hope they get all the insurance money.
[82:03.55]Let them write all this shit off.
[82:06.09]Look, if you're going to go in and throw the person's bed out the window, just let them have the $400,000 check.
[82:10.58]You know what I mean?
[82:14.01]Don't just, like, break the bed.
[82:15.07]Because then it's like, fuck.
[82:24.78]Mr. Beast.
[82:26.44]Alright, this is the one.
[82:27.56]This is the one.
[82:30.40]I have to destroy this.
[82:33.14]Wait, hold on.
[82:33.68]I, like, love this house.
[82:42.11]Is it weird that I love this?
[82:46.07]It's like what a view of the ocean right where your bed is.
[82:48.77]It's just a little spot.
[82:50.35]It's like you can eat dinner over here.
[82:51.61]You can put like a little... I love this place.
[82:58.76]Perfect little bathroom.
[83:01.46]This is sick.
[83:02.50]No kitchen?
[83:03.41]Who cares?
[83:03.83]I don't cook anyways.
[83:06.01]I would actually prefer a house with no kitchen.
[83:16.41]Like, if I could have no kitchen, an extra room for, like, I don't know, like a shelf or something?
[83:24.10]Or, like, extra TV space?
[83:25.78]Or extra, uh, yeah, I would, I don't know, I don't even use my kitchen.
[83:33.85]Alright, I, that, that... Okay, so this is, this'll work pretty easily, right?
[83:45.98]Fire alert.
[83:46.58]Okay, at what point does it become too much?
[83:55.95]Okay, put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out.
[84:01.87]Put it out, put it out.
[84:07.21]Okay, we just have to get it to a point where the fire alarm doesn't go off.
[84:12.67]And just don't spread to this house.
[84:28.81]This is crazy.
[84:29.77]I know I've made a... Looking out your window reference like five times this stream.
[84:40.21]But looking out this window here and being like, oh, come the fuck on, dude.
[85:03.08]Like, what the fuck are you doing?
[85:04.72]If I fall in the water, do I die?
[85:19.67]Alright, now let's clean the rest up.
[85:28.60]Good, that's tall enough where it'll get there.
[85:31.28]Okay, cool.
[85:32.38]Is that gonna hurt me?
[85:34.37]Irma, what are you doing?
[85:35.83]It told me to burn the place down.
[85:38.17]It said to destroy this place.
[85:51.62]Don't let that get too out of control.
[85:53.36]What is this?
[85:53.82]Alright, hold on.
[85:58.73]It's starting to...
[86:03.87]Use the boat.

[87:22.95]Oh, shit, shit, shit!
[87:35.68]Okay, I got enough... Do I die if you go in the water?
[87:37.74]Do you die if you go in the water?
[87:40.78]Do you die if you go in the water?
[87:42.24]No.
[87:42.40]Oh, shit.
[87:50.36]I'm sorry.
[87:50.82]I'm sorry.
[87:52.86]I'm sorry.
[87:53.58]It'll be repaired.

[88:09.36]I'm out.
[88:13.13]Did he drown?
[88:16.99]Is firework underwater?
[88:17.95]Alright, escape.
[88:21.32]That was kind of fun.
[88:22.38]That was cool.
[88:23.12]This game's really cool.
[88:24.38]This game's awesome.
[88:26.50]I'm serious.
[88:27.64]This is really good.
[88:30.86]Escape vehicle is... Oh, right here.
[88:39.89]Destroy all the houses.
[88:47.46]Here, I'll do this for you.
[89:06.56]Fuck.
[89:07.12]Too high.
[89:18.50]Shit!
[89:19.08]Too high.
[89:19.42]Alright, last try.
[89:26.22]Damn it, whatever.
[89:33.49]Throw wood that's on fire, and I'm the maniac.
[89:43.00]Dude, I can't believe he's, like, burning down this building.
[89:45.36]You psycho.
[89:46.66]Wow, like, this is not even, like, funny.
[89:48.63]Hey, dude, uh, stand, like, really safe distance back and throw burning material into the other houses that have nothing to do with the mission.
[89:55.83]You psycho.
[90:02.08]Porn week?
[90:03.24]See you next week for porn week!
[90:05.70]You reached a new rank.
[90:06.46]A new tool's been delivered.
[90:14.58]Oh, I have to fix my own house.
[90:16.92]It's raining.
[90:17.54]It has to be perfect or I can't move on.
[90:30.53]I don't care.
[90:30.99]Just let me in.
[90:37.62]Look, I have a better idea.
[90:39.68]Have it go all the way down to the soil.
[90:41.04]Oh.
[90:44.72]Is this a bathroom?
[90:48.52]This is a really, really weird stall.
[90:50.38]I feel like you could see everything.
[90:52.92]Like, isn't this... It's enormous.
[90:57.89]Why do I have a stall in my house?
[91:01.59]A new tool has been delivered.
[91:02.47]New tool!
[91:04.61]Shotgun.
[91:07.01]It's actually a shotgun.
[91:08.51]That was just a really stupid joke.
[91:10.37]It's an actual shotgun.
[91:26.74]Why is this game so good?
[91:27.64]This is so cool.
[91:29.54]Am I out of bullets?
[91:36.78]How do you reload?
[91:43.18]Classic cars.
[91:43.98]Fantastic work at the marina.
[91:46.40]Looks like it worked because they just cleared a construction permit for the new dock.
[91:50.25]Another thing came up.
[91:51.49]There was this classic car auction up in the Black River the other day, and one guy just kept overbidding me.
[91:57.89]Lawrence Lee Jr., that youngster who inherited the chemical plant a few years ago, absolutely no interest in cars.
[92:03.29]He's just looking for ways to rotate his dirty money.
[92:09.03]Okay.
[92:09.91]It's this thing.
[92:11.58]The one they used in Seal the Deal 2 and Colonel Wilson's personal.
[92:16.37]Jacoby from Normandy.
[92:18.53]Lee is about to put those cars on a ship overseas and in Danao and they'll be out of the country for good.
[92:22.99]Yep.
[92:25.23]If that's not criminal, I don't know what is.
[92:27.49]Can you help me acquire these two gems?
[92:29.97]I'll take good care of them.
[92:31.85]Okay, we gotta steal classic cars.
[92:35.27]Get the two classic cars for Gordon.
[92:36.63]Drive them to the marked area at the back of the truck.
[92:38.55]If possible, also pick up spare parts and vehicle registration documents.
[92:43.57]No, my tools!
[92:44.55]My tools!
[92:45.13]My tools!
[92:54.35]Wait.
[92:55.69]He's stealing?
[92:58.97]Was stealing worse than burning a house down?
[93:04.16]Okay.
[93:04.50]Sledge.
[93:05.53]No upgrades.
[93:06.05]Spray can.
[93:06.63]No upgrades.
[93:07.15]Fire.
[93:07.63]No.
[93:07.95]Blowtorch.
[93:08.47]No.
[93:08.69]Shotgun.
[93:12.19]Ooh.
[93:12.97]Range.
[93:14.03]Damage.
[93:14.73]How much money do I have?
[93:15.41]Okay.
[93:21.10]Range.
[93:21.50]Damage.
[93:22.36]No.
[93:22.62]Damage rounds.
[93:24.26]And... Yeah.
[93:28.70]Alright.
[93:32.57]There's another one.
[93:34.94]I've been up all night digging through the login devices and managed to find a connection to the West Point Marina.
[93:39.92]I've been able to figure out more on BT, but Lee has a warehouse in West Point, I guess.
[93:43.79]Whatever fishy business he's up to, the marina is not the final destination.
[93:46.59]I was thinking the boat GPS device can give me an idea where he's moving the product.
[93:51.93]Especially if I could compare their recent destinations to the shipping log.
[93:54.95]Can you get them for me?
[93:56.01]Are we just, are we a double agent here?
[93:57.26]This is double agent.
[94:05.01]Watch the news.
[94:05.59]According to Harbormaster Jim Delish, research through all available records, but no proof of a fifth cabin could be found.
[94:18.70]Without evidence, the rumors still persist of a ghost cabin.
[94:23.73]Next week, art or remnants from the afterlife.
[94:26.45]We're gaslighting the neighbors that that person's house never existed?
[94:34.89]I mean, couldn't the neighbor clearly just be like, hey, there's a shitload of damage right where the dock meets.
[94:40.67]And there's a hole in my house.
[94:44.12]Oh, and I saw the guy outside.
[94:45.78]I didn't like that fucking chair.
[94:56.39]Or that picture.
[94:56.95]Alright, let's do the classic cars one.
[95:00.35]That sounds fun.
[95:05.73]It's unexplainable, dude.
[95:07.11]Okay.
[95:12.89]Classic car is what we got.
[95:16.63]Car in warehouse, car on ship.
[95:20.42]Documents in office.
[95:21.68]Alright, let's go get this one first.
[95:24.20]Wait.
[95:26.48]No, let's get this one first.
[95:28.84]This one is car in warehouse and spare parts.
[95:33.06]Let's go to the warehouse.
[95:34.86]Bang a right.
[95:49.08]Shotgun.
[95:51.74]Wait, check the warehouse for materials.
[95:57.34]Easy mode is over.
[95:59.80]What do you mean easy mode?
[96:04.20]Ooh, aluminum propeller.
[96:05.14]That's 60 bucks.
[96:08.94]Ooh, what's that?
[96:15.66]Mizaka premium spark plugs.
[96:17.38]80 bucks.
[96:23.40]Alright.
[96:24.02]Drive car out of just to drop off point.
[96:31.62]I'm gonna use a boat to get there.
[96:32.58]$80 spark plugs.
[96:51.82]Oh, mega.
[97:00.17]Alright, is that a car?
[97:02.92]Car is inside.
[97:03.92]Alright, let's... I want to get this in a good spot.
[97:08.00]Say toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[97:13.72]Get out of here.
[97:14.28]What do you think?
[97:14.64]I'm not talented enough to do that?
[97:15.82]Is there money in the oven?
[97:28.05]Money in the fridge.
[97:29.67]Room.
[97:32.76]Anything on the shelves?
[97:35.54]No?
[97:38.60]He used a sound board?
[97:39.78]What?
[97:43.72]Think of a money.
[97:44.74]Think of things to steal that cost money.
[97:46.86]Okay, there it is.
[97:49.48]Not yet.
[97:58.60]Anything valuable in here?
[97:59.66]This office chair looks pretty valuable.
[98:08.98]I haven't used doors.
[98:09.72]It's not even... Mr. Amenatides, visit Lee's birthday.
[98:14.30]Other topics.
[98:15.56]Now you'll forget that one.
[98:16.90]Wait.
[98:18.64]This has an alarm on it.
[98:37.49]60 seconds?! !
[98:43.38]Wait, why am I... Alright, is it cool if you just get one?
[99:14.28]Okay.
[99:15.40]So, here's the deal.
[99:17.58]You have to do the cars first.
[99:20.12]Then I gotta come back and do these if I want to.
[99:21.75]Okay.
[99:35.79]Just drive this.
[99:39.49]Where's the drop-off point?
[99:43.76]Alright, there's the drop-off point right here.
[99:46.68]Just get to the drop-off point.
[99:50.25]What the fuck are you stuck on?
[100:00.85]Put the bed down.
[100:01.59]It's gonna hit a bunch of shit.
[100:08.65]Just don't let the thing fall off.
[100:10.33]There's no time limit.
[100:19.23]If it was up, it would smash into stuff.
[100:23.62]Okay, now... So get it here.
[100:27.74]Okay, here's the plan.
[100:38.77]I'm going to give you the plan.
[100:40.53]The plan is... Do not unplug this yet.
[100:46.45]Keep it right there.
[100:47.37]Get the other one.
[100:51.76]I'll get the other one.
[100:59.70]Save it.
[101:05.10]The other one's over here.
[101:05.76]Right?
[101:07.36]Isn't it right here?
[101:07.86]Yeah.
[101:10.24]Alright.
[101:11.42]Melt this shit.
[101:21.49]Let's take a look.
[101:25.41]Other car is... It's not here!
[101:27.58]Somebody got here before I did and they took it!
[101:29.52]Where is it?
[101:38.34]It's here.
[101:39.40]But unfortunately, this one is also plugged in.
[101:46.42]I have to forklift this.
[101:48.18]I gotta forklift this all the way up.
[101:54.02]Let's make some room.
[101:54.50]Can I drive the boat?
[102:01.42]Oh, shit.
[102:01.86]You can drive the boat.
[102:02.70]Okay.
[102:03.60]So, this is gonna be like a James Bond movie.
[102:07.28]Get this over here.
[102:08.58]We're gonna park it right there so I can just drive over there.
[102:10.89]Alright, I got it.
[102:11.39]Go, go, go.
[102:11.79]I got it.
[102:13.07]I got the idea.
[102:30.37]Put on Mission Impossible music?
[102:32.99]Well, in the world of new Twitch DMCAs, I don't think that that's a good idea anymore.
[102:49.98]No more Doom music.
[102:51.30]Well, I don't think that's accurate.
[102:57.78]Oh dear.
[103:01.14]We're dropping lots of frames right now.
[103:04.22]Why is it so frame ready?
[103:05.48]Okay.
[103:05.72]Alright, don't move, don't move, don't move, don't move.
[103:09.18]Oh, don't, hey, that, shh.
[103:12.83]Keep it, where am I?
[103:18.29]Okay, holy shit.
[103:20.23]It's perfect, it's perfect, shh, it's perfect.
[103:22.27]It's perfect.
[103:23.67]It's fucking perfect.
[103:26.71]Okay, don't touch anything.
[103:36.62]It's fucking perfect.
[103:37.26]Alright, we're gonna have to melt this.
[103:45.12]Just to make sure it can fit in here.
[103:46.16]That's not gonna... That fits through there, right?
[104:07.63]It's absolutely... Okay, now.
[104:09.30]Save the game.
[104:10.94]Now this is where it gets tricky.
[104:13.28]Now I gotta go steal the stuff.
[104:15.50]I gotta get a car.
[104:17.90]I gotta go... We're gonna go here.
[104:19.64]Steal this.
[104:20.22]Boat.
[104:20.54]Steal this.
[104:21.48]Car.
[104:22.06]Drive.
[104:22.94]Everything go in.
[104:25.22]The ship is sinking right now.
[104:27.12]It is?
[104:27.32]No, it isn't.
[104:32.10]It's fine.
[104:36.76]You see money?
[104:39.14]Okay.
[104:39.83]I need a car.
[104:40.53]Oh, fuck yeah.
[104:44.57]Oh, this is cool.
[104:45.59]Alright.
[104:46.87]We gotta go here first.
[104:49.27]Let's get up there and I'm saving it.
[104:50.79]I'm ready to James Bond the fuck out of this.
[104:55.34]Got a perfect ramp.
[104:56.22]That's gonna take less than 15 seconds.
[105:09.18]Wait.
[105:10.64]I know a lot of you just were about to Pepe left.
[105:13.60]I gotta get this all the way across to the other side, to the other building.
[105:17.23]After I James Bond one way.
[105:18.59]Yep.
[105:21.21]I need a car to drive down here.
[105:22.30]Alright, let's do it.
[105:26.86]Okay, let's...
[105:44.40]Am I going to do anything else besides that part?
[105:48.52]Turn this around.
[105:52.84]DMCA?
[105:53.74]You can't DMCA ass voice.
[106:02.07]You cannot.
[106:02.95]Don't break that.
[106:03.63]Okay, this is ready.
[106:04.43]This is going to line it up.
[106:06.35]Go.
[106:07.09]It's ready.
[106:12.56]So, the plan.
[106:15.14]That's there.
[106:17.38]This is, hear me out.
[106:19.01]Start here.
[106:19.45]Grab it.
[106:21.29]Out the window.
[106:24.01]Into a boat.
[106:24.47]Across the water.
[106:26.49]Down.
[106:26.91]Here.
[106:28.89]Over here.
[106:29.25]Park it.
[106:43.15]In there.
[106:43.43]Yeah, that was the Pirate's Thief song.
[106:53.54]I was just trying to do it so shitty so that I couldn't get DMCA'd.
[106:56.52]You can't DMCA a shitty sound.
[107:03.36]Okay, you know like the Lord of the Rings song, like that...
[107:10.94]Just change it a little, and you're fine.
[107:13.62]So, like... See?
[107:15.56]And then you can just say, that's my original song.
[107:21.34]The notes are completely different.
[107:25.42]Ready?
[107:25.96]I'm ready.
[107:27.60]Let's do it.
[107:53.89]Just change one note.
[107:58.77]We'd be grateful if you didn't do that anymore.
[108:02.05]And do what?
[108:06.70]You got something to say?
[108:07.66]Wait, what do you got something to say?
[108:17.14]I'm going to save it.
[108:17.76]We'll see if I can get this to work.
[108:23.15]So the deal is here.
[108:25.19]Okay, where is this?
[108:26.11]Okay, right, right, right.
[108:28.34]It's upstairs.
[108:29.46]I'm going to quick save it.
[108:31.42]And we're going right out this fucking window.
[108:35.48]Right in this window to a boat.
[108:40.75]Alright, make it easy.
[108:41.59]Boat.
[108:44.25]Jump.
[108:47.51]One.
[108:47.65]Two.
[108:57.81]I thought it was going to be a jump.
[108:58.59]I thought it was going to be a cool jump.
[108:59.67]I'm sorry.
[108:59.97]I thought it was going to be a cool jump.
[109:03.39]Wasn't cool.
[109:03.85]I thought it was going to launch.
[109:15.79]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[109:17.01]This is just like a relay race.
[109:30.06]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[109:38.82]Watch it.
[109:40.28]Fuck.
[109:41.70]Shit.
[109:42.62]I got time.
[109:43.04]I got time, time, time, time, time.
[109:44.18]I got time.
[109:44.54]I got time.
[109:44.92]I got time.
[109:45.28]I got time.
[109:45.66]I got time.
[109:53.98]Where is it?
[109:54.64]Oh, shit.
[109:55.06]It's back here.
[109:55.98]It was a little sloppy.
[109:57.12]It's okay.
[110:19.36]Not even close.
[110:21.03]I could probably do it if I get it clean.
[110:28.95]Burn the cars in first.
[111:04.82]He did it again.
[111:07.31]It's so hard to turn.
[111:09.27]Whatever.
[111:09.67]It's fine.
[111:10.03]It's fine.
[111:10.53]It's fine.
[111:10.95]I just gotta get that turn right.
[111:27.69]I'll get it.
[111:28.07]I'm gonna get it.
[111:33.00]I'll get it next time.
[111:33.64]I'll get it next time.
[111:34.16]I'm gonna get it next time.
[111:34.84]I'm gonna absolutely get it next time.
[111:38.78]100% chance that I get it right this time.
[111:40.82]Just don't crash the van.
[111:41.86]Yep.
[111:43.02]This is the one.
[112:14.40]That's the one, this is the one.
[112:22.38]There we go.
[112:39.99]Wait, wait, where's the, wait, what?
[112:41.57]How do I leave?
[112:42.55]Okay.
[112:45.80]That was fun.
[112:50.88]What is this?
[112:51.34]It shows you the route you took?
[112:53.76]Oh, yeah.
[112:54.38]Take a look at that.
[113:00.80]Perfectly executed.
[113:01.79]I messed up a little on the turn.
[113:11.41]On this right turn here, it was a little too heavy on the handbrake.
[113:16.47]Yeah, a little too much.
[113:17.69]Just his hair.
[113:26.47]Oops.
[113:30.41]I was trying to back up into the circle so it would register.
[113:33.15]How about this?
[113:35.57]Come on.
[113:36.15]Look at this setup.
[113:36.93]You're telling me to look at this.
[113:39.39]Raise the bridge.
[113:40.13]No, thank you.
[113:40.77]Come on.
[113:54.31]Let's go with 14.
[113:56.79]I only have $260.
[114:00.04]I did every optional thing, too.
[114:01.46]That's all I get?
[114:02.90]What?
[114:03.10]I did a lot.
[114:06.84]Where am I?
[114:09.46]Corn?
[114:09.82]Can I eat this?
[114:18.46]There's taxes.
[114:24.98]Really?
[114:25.30]It was taxes?
[114:27.92]I had to pay taxes?
[114:40.35]What we got?
[114:42.03]Alright.
[114:42.77]What about tools?
[114:43.45]Anything new?
[114:45.21]I want to upgrade the sledgehammer.
[114:48.65]Nah, keep the money.
[114:51.62]Okay, not really demolition, but...
[114:56.12]You don't know me, but I've had a series of break-ins recently.
[114:59.20]In the last one, I lost two very rare classic cars, and guess what?
[115:03.08]I know who did it.
[115:04.88]Gordon Wu, that absolute prick, is now bragging to everyone at the club about his two new fave possessions.
[115:11.67]The break-ins caused me a lot of property damage, and I'd like to let Gordon taste some of his own medicine.
[115:16.09]Since you're in the demolition industry, I thought, well, I don't know if you do this sort of work, but let me know if it sounds interesting.
[115:22.89]Yeah, dude, let's just go play the complete opposite.
[115:26.94]The home of mall manager and racing enthusiast Gordon Wu, his daughter Freya, and finance Enid Cummins.
[115:33.74]An exclusive mansion with a private racetrack in the backyard.
[115:37.39]Dump at least three of Gordon's expensive cars in the water.
[115:48.80]Oh, what about the news shit?
[115:57.21]Alright, dump some cars in the water.
[116:00.67]This dude has like a military base for a house.
[116:07.17]Wired alarm boxes.
[116:08.19]Breaking an alarm box or wire triggers the alarm, right?
[116:10.67]Okay.
[116:12.35]I'm gonna dump him in the ocean.
[116:20.06]Oh, this doesn't do anything.
[116:22.32]You gotta be kidding.
[116:22.82]This dude probably has tons of money in this house.
[116:29.37]Don't forget bingo at the marina.
[116:32.27]Alright, forget about the cars.
[116:34.97]I'm just going to take a bunch of money.
[116:35.95]This is just the first mission in Hitman 2.
[116:42.73]This game just is Hitman 2 with breaking things.
[116:45.75]This is just break stuff Hitman.
[116:48.37]Can I take the painting?
[116:58.76]Upper class table manners.
[117:04.15]Damn.
[117:04.65]You got strong windows.
[117:08.03]Okay.
[117:10.37]This is too big.
[117:11.05]I hate this.
[117:14.51]This place... Okay.
[117:15.87]I want... My entire house.
[117:18.95]Or apartment.
[117:19.59]Or wherever.
[117:20.65]I only want it to be like this big.
[117:23.35]This is too... I hate everything about this.
[117:29.30]It's too much.
[117:30.36]It's too much space.
[117:36.82]You have your own... You have your own personal grocery store?
[117:43.79]It's too big.
[117:45.25]Is this a sauna?
[117:47.15]It's too much.
[117:48.27]It's too huge.
[117:49.83]I would get... Dad, there's a sauna.
[117:51.15]I knew it.
[117:51.45]Of course there is.
[117:55.91]No, I don't want a sauna in my house.
[117:57.39]Do you know how much maintenance goes into this?
[118:01.16]Guys, you cannot treat a sauna like you treat your toilet bowl.
[118:04.82]Like, I guess it's been like a few months.
[118:06.74]Might as well like stick the thing in there and brush around the edges of the disgusting stuff that's in there.
[118:17.33]Somebody has to take care of this every single fucking minute of every day.
[118:22.90]Months?
[118:23.34]Well, I mean like a week?
[118:26.22]Vacuum cleaner.
[118:30.11]Why do you have all these explosives?
[118:35.17]What's this?
[118:37.22]Why did I hit the light exactly?
[118:38.96]There's gotta be valuables here.
[118:43.60]Rich people can pay for that.
[118:51.16]Yeah, I know, but... Just... It's just, like, why?
[118:59.28]Look, having a nice house is one thing, but having, like, two saunas in your house.
[119:02.92]Having an elevator in your house.
[119:05.70]It's like... This is... I would hate this.
[119:10.04]This is just... Anybody that can see through here sees if you have an elevator in your house.
[119:15.84]If you have an elevator in your house, there's a bag of money in there somewhere that you don't care about.
[119:22.53]Why the fuck would you give a shit if you have an elevator in your house?
[119:36.41]What about if you're disabled?
[119:37.51]Oh, yeah, that makes perfect sense.
[119:39.66]But I'm gonna just take a wild guess and say that this person is doing it because they're just, they want to.
[119:47.94]Look at this.
[119:50.32]What practical reason is this for?
[119:53.50]What is this?
[120:01.12]I mean, you cannot tell me for, like, some kind of excuse that, like, he's, like, a Dr. Seuss fan or something.
[120:05.36]Like...
[120:11.72]Just looking for money.
[120:14.88]Yep, definitely going to be a safe back here.
[120:16.42]This is absolutely going to be a safe.
[120:21.35]Wait, that was probably worth a lot of money.
[120:23.99]No safe behind the painting, really?
[120:25.49]Come on.
[120:33.40]Okay, so I just destroyed this whole painting.
[120:36.94]There's just a frame here, and I don't see a difference.
[120:40.63]Than when it was not broken.
[120:47.59]Elevator.
[120:48.23]No, wait.
[120:48.73]Bedroom.
[120:51.67]Nothing in the bed.
[120:53.89]Dude, this looks like a fucking Oreo cookie.
[120:55.89]I want to bite this.
[120:56.47]Doesn't it?
[120:57.91]Doesn't it?
[120:58.51]Doesn't it?
[120:59.37]Doesn't it look like an ice cream cake?
[121:03.83]I want to bite this ice cream cake.
[121:09.61]You know what I'm talking about when you bite in and it's like so cold in the middle here?
[121:13.15]It's like kind of frozen and your teeth just smudge through it, really freezing cold and it's still- I want it.
[121:17.71]Alright, but anyways, there's nothing under here.
[121:25.00]Wait, there might be.
[121:29.58]Weird, weird super rich people like this probably have- I don't know, this probably- I told you, I told you.
[121:35.04]There's like fucking 30 BTC back here.
[121:38.32]Sleeping pills.
[121:39.10]Oh, no.
[121:45.20]Nothing?
[121:51.38]Nothing?
[121:52.24]Come on.
[121:52.78]That's like a super huge bed.
[121:54.08]What is this?
[121:59.09]Ugh, turn it off.
[121:59.71]I don't like it.
[122:02.75]Defensive shoes?
[122:08.42]What's behind the mirror?
[122:14.78]Expensive shirt?
[122:17.05]No?
[122:19.35]No?
[122:20.79]What?
[122:23.33]Blind.
[122:24.03]Blind.
[122:24.45]Blind.
[122:24.73]What do you mean blind?
[122:25.29]Is it something expensive that I missed?
[122:27.93]I missed them?
[122:35.85]On the shelf?
[122:36.51]Right next to where you smashed.
[122:48.54]What do you mean?
[122:50.23]Oh, right here.
[122:50.61]There you go.
[122:52.19]It's a wallet.
[122:54.40]This bright flashlight was making it fucked up.
[122:56.40]Alright.
[123:30.46]And then we're really gonna make this work in our favor.
[123:52.50]Now he's gonna be like, fucking Steve?
[123:56.42]My name's not Steve, my name's like fucking Jerry.
[124:08.80]Let's really confuse the fuck out of him.
[124:10.55]What do you say?

[126:16.63]No way!
[126:20.44]Oh, wait a minute.
[126:26.76]Fuck yeah.
[126:28.56]That was fun.
[126:45.45]Oh, there's cars.
[126:46.03]We're supposed to be doing car stuff.
[126:47.27]Okay.
[126:47.39]Okay.
[126:57.36]No, no, no.
[126:57.84]Let's be an asshole.
[126:58.60]Ready?
[127:20.23]It's like my painting.
[127:24.51]Oh, no!
[127:26.55]And then we're at this.
[128:06.64]Yeah.
[128:07.46]What do you think about that?
[128:10.66]What's the difference?
[128:26.83]The Joker does that.
[128:29.39]Oh, and by the way, I'm going to leave my calling card here.
[128:39.74]It's supposed to be the Joker.
[128:40.78]Hold on.
[128:59.37]If you're good at something, never do it for free.
[129:09.91]Okay, let's steal some more stuff.
[129:13.43]I'm gonna, like, ice climb up his house.
[129:14.75]Appreciate it.
[129:22.70]You have such an expensive house and you have an antenna TV?
[129:26.44]What the fuck are you doing?
[129:27.58]What's this?
[129:32.20]Can I press this?
[129:35.18]I can't press this button.
[129:37.80]Oops.
[129:38.18]Well, hopefully I didn't need that.
[129:42.84]Draw a helipad.
[129:43.94]No, no, like... From himself, like, anyone that flies over, he'll never know.
[129:51.97]How about, like, just, like, I eat ass.
[129:54.07]Because you're gonna be able to see that if you fly over.
[130:29.89]Even after the people come in, they're like, yeah, we took care of the burglary.
[130:32.80]Everything's all sorted.
[130:33.56]It's been all cleaned up.
[130:47.78]Oh, shit.
[130:48.22]I gotta move this stuff.
[130:50.28]It's in the way of my art project.
[131:01.26]Alright, what if we write, I eat my own ass.
[131:05.81]Is that possible?
[131:14.98]Is it too long?
[131:26.38]It might be too long.
[131:27.46]I eat my own ass.
[131:30.47]No, it'll work.
[132:20.51]I can get up there, hold on.
[132:21.75]Fuck, I need to get back up there.
[132:28.68]This place is too big.
[132:46.51]Okay, we're good.
[132:49.13]So, I eat my- Ow.
[132:57.15]That end sucks.
[133:04.09]Fuck!
[133:04.61]This end sucks!
[133:06.09]This end is terrible!
[133:07.73]Can I burn it away?
[133:08.55]I can- No, I can fix it, I can fix it, I can fix it.
[133:15.72]Hold on.
[133:21.81]OW!
[133:32.43]Move on?
[133:32.83]I-I-I can't!
[133:33.93]I have to finish this!
[133:54.23]Alright, I saved it.
[133:56.09]The end's just very thick.
[134:16.07]I saved it.
[134:16.57]It's saved.
[134:16.93]Okay.
[134:37.83]Got it!
[134:39.37]Got it!
[134:53.84]It's the wrong way?
[134:54.96]It doesn't- What do you mean the wrong way?
[134:56.76]Fuck that dish!
[135:10.81]Okay, that's good.
[135:12.06]Now, there's more money probably in this house somewhere.
[135:15.82]Can I die?
[135:16.42]Oh, look at this artwork!
[135:24.16]I can spin it.
[135:31.33]Holy shit, I can't destroy it.
[135:36.35]It's kind of fun just exploring this house.
[135:40.58]Oh, this is expensive.
[135:41.40]Okay, hold on.
[135:56.28]I have an idea.
[136:04.07]Hey!
[136:14.98]Okay, I'm going to go this way.
[136:16.12]Alright, this is important.
[136:33.82]Hold on.
[136:46.35]Can't destroy it?
[136:51.99]Oh, that's too bad.
[136:54.81]I was gonna draw a huge line that went around the entire house and at the start it said, where is your art?
[137:00.83]And that was gonna have to be just broken at the end.
[137:02.40]Oh, there we go.
[137:11.88]Okay.
[137:36.96]He's gonna have to follow this around his whole fucking house.
[137:39.94]Okay, where is your art?
[138:19.00]It's supposed to say where.
[138:29.85]This is so fucked up.
[138:34.19]Where did it go?
[138:35.13]What is this?
[138:37.89]Oh no, where did my tapeworm go?
[138:40.89]It's gotta be in here somewhere.
[138:48.44]Where did he put it?
[138:57.47]Now he's gonna take a guess.
[138:58.53]Can I spray paint the water?
[139:07.52]Wrong.
[139:19.85]He's gonna backtrack.
[139:20.67]He's gonna go over here.
[139:27.19]I guess you wouldn't, like, follow this like an idiot.
[139:29.93]You would just go to where it looks.
[139:32.03]And here it is.
[139:32.65]The end.
[139:36.62]No!
[139:38.00]And we need a message here.
[139:42.30]Uh...
[140:03.82]See, I drew him a new one.
[140:04.64]This one's free.
[140:11.36]Yeah.
[140:15.02]Okay, is this car illegal?
[140:20.89]Okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna play the game.
[140:27.23]Main garage.
[140:27.87]Okay.
[140:29.07]Where do I have to bring them to?
[140:30.83]They gotta come out to here.
[140:34.18]Okay, they all have an alarm.
[140:36.10]So I gotta make a... I gotta make a route.
[140:40.12]Shit, the spray can.
[140:46.98]Oh, shit.
[140:48.45]Okay.
[140:49.79]Save the game?
[140:50.31]I have 60 seconds to do this?
[140:54.91]Alright, this one can just go straight through.
[140:57.99]So let's go like this.
[141:00.51]Make a good way to get out of here.
[141:01.67]Give me the shotgun.
[141:02.67]Let's just stop blowing holes.
[141:11.02]I'll just burn it down.
[141:11.90]Can I just burn this place down?
[141:24.93]That's a pretty cool table, but I just ruined it.
[141:26.45]I want a good, clean place to drive here, so go through here.
[141:34.81]This way.
[141:36.15]Straight here.
[141:36.73]I'm going to take this.
[141:38.33]I need like a demolisher.
[141:39.79]Whatever that.
[141:40.29]Okay.
[141:40.55]I need a demolisher.
[141:45.53]This thing can go into water?
[141:54.45]I bet that.
[141:54.79]I don't think I need.
[141:55.86]As long as I can just drive straight through here.
[142:00.98]Take the alarm, take the pillar off and put it on top of the car.
[142:04.81]That didn't work.
[142:32.32]Yeah, I have to, like, I gotta destroy all this shit.
[142:40.48]Didn't save?
[142:40.88]Yeah, I did.
[142:41.16]Okay, dump at least three of the cars.
[142:51.04]I want this.
[142:51.56]Okay, we're gonna do this one.
[142:52.80]There's three here.
[142:56.30]No, that's me.
[142:56.78]Okay, I want this one, this one,
[143:01.64]And this one.
[143:03.10]Let's make a route.
[143:09.82]Jump at least three of the... Oh, in the water.
[143:13.90]Oh, okay.
[143:14.34]Well, that makes it a lot easier.
[143:16.78]There's this one here.
[143:17.48]Just right that way.
[143:20.23]Just right that way.
[143:31.91]Dump him in the pool?
[143:32.79]Is there water in this pool?
[143:35.03]Oh, there's no water in here.
[143:43.64]Doesn't need to be in the ocean.
[143:45.50]Wait, where is the... There is water somewhere, isn't there?
[143:49.82]No, right here.
[143:52.70]There's this pool here.
[143:53.79]I guess I could try to do that one.
[143:55.55]Or this one.
[143:58.29]I could just drive off.
[144:05.01]Alright, let's keep this going, though.
[144:05.85]I want to... There's that one.
[144:08.07]There's the one that's in the showroom here.
[144:10.01]That should be fine.
[144:16.74]So we're just going to... That way.
[144:19.70]Why open a door?
[144:38.39]Straight that way.
[144:42.45]Straight that way.
[144:44.86]And now... Those two can just go get dumped.
[144:47.84]And what about this one?
[144:50.66]Wait, there's one here, too.
[144:51.82]Holy shit, there's like four right here.
[144:54.40]Alright, this one can go straight.
[144:57.43]Fuck the gazebo.
[145:00.05]Alright, we're gonna see... There's one right there, too.
[145:12.15]Wait, can I do that?
[145:33.50]Can I do that?
[145:43.89]Can't.
[145:50.77]Oh, this has got to be way cleaner too.
[145:52.61]It's like I got to destroy all this grass.
[145:56.71]You 100% can.
[145:58.17]No, you can't.
[146:04.80]It was patched.
[146:05.90]Oh.
[146:07.12]Well, they patched it.
[146:07.82]Alright, we're going to take care of all this grass.
[146:19.28]Um.
[146:20.48]Or not.
[146:30.58]Alright.
[146:30.74]I just need to be able to get out of this.
[146:31.76]So don't.
[146:33.46]Yeah.
[146:33.64]Let's drive straight.
[146:34.42]And then.
[146:39.96]I guess I could just.
[146:41.10]I could just drive this thing straight.
[146:43.32]Straight.
[146:47.34]There's a hot tub right here.
[146:49.10]Hold on.
[146:49.38]I have to test something.
[147:04.00]Is that hot tub?
[147:05.66]Oh, it's upstairs.
[147:09.58]Never mind.
[147:17.11]Drive up the stairs?
[147:18.15]I can't drive up the stairs.
[147:20.64]It's not upstairs?
[147:21.50]Yeah, it is.
[147:26.59]That's clearly upstairs.
[147:28.87]Alright, so this one goes straight.
[147:32.11]Drive it straight all the way into the ocean.
[147:36.99]This one.
[147:37.41]Drive it.
[147:39.16]Just drive it out there.
[147:40.12]That one, drive it out there.
[147:42.58]This is like a big jump right here.
[147:43.72]I'm just going to fly off this and just ghost ride it off.
[147:46.04]Okay.
[147:47.04]Ghost ride that one.
[147:47.80]Drive that one.
[147:48.36]Alright, let me plan this out.
[147:55.26]Ghost ride it.
[147:56.58]Then take this one.
[147:58.13]We'll do this one first.
[148:00.09]This one can be driven straight.
[148:03.54]Let me see if I can just get these four.
[148:04.64]I'm not going for the fucking 100%.
[148:05.94]Who cares?
[148:06.30]Let me see if I can get these four.
[148:26.92]This is one.
[148:30.22]Ray's car lift.
[148:37.68]Alright, I'm gonna go for it.
[148:44.05]Ready?
[148:45.11]One, two, three, go!
[148:46.25]I don't have any tires.
[148:52.03]Okay, so... Looks like I'm gonna have to carry it.
[149:06.02]There's tires over here.
[149:07.60]Can I put them on?
[149:08.28]I don't think I can put these on.
[149:14.48]No, you can't.
[149:17.98]Wait, hold on.
[149:24.38]Can't, like, push it?
[149:25.07]No.
[149:29.33]Lift the car.
[149:31.03]Wait, I...
[149:48.21]You can't do that.
[149:48.83]That's made up.
[149:51.11]You made that up.
[150:03.50]No, it doesn't work.
[150:04.20]I gotta carry this out with a tractor or something.
[150:08.16]Wait.
[150:09.88]Can I just put a car on top of a car?
[150:11.36]Okay.
[150:50.30]I just kinda squished it a little.
[151:14.23]It almost kinda worked.
[151:24.50]I have another lift.
[151:42.95]It's like snow, you just gotta make the tires free.
[152:17.13]Wait a minute.
[152:18.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second, wait a second.
[152:21.57]It never said anything about the car needing to be in one piece.
[152:27.87]Throw this fucking thing in the ocean.
[152:35.98]It didn't say shit about that.
[152:44.66]Hold on a second.
[153:08.13]Move out of the way.
[153:14.50]It's on this fucking car now.
[153:16.04]Wait a minute.
[153:22.96]Walk it to the ocean?
[153:23.90]That's what I'm... I just... I don't know how I fucked that up.
[153:25.91]Alright, here we go.
[153:28.61]Where's the nearest ocean?
[153:32.83]Okay.
[153:33.79]I just drag it this way.
[153:38.12]Game over, I win.
[153:38.68]Imagine if this worked.
[153:45.94]There's a pond in the racetrack?
[153:54.13]Holy shit, there is.
[153:55.75]You fucking genius.
[154:05.66]I'm driving it.
[154:07.04]I'm driving it.
[154:23.08]I'd like everyone to apologize to me, please.
[154:34.19]He just Flintstones the car.
[154:36.61]Alright, now.
[154:37.45]So that's one.
[154:37.99]I just need to get two.
[154:39.97]Yeah, let's get out of here.
[154:46.56]That's that one.
[154:47.24]Now I can just go straight.
[154:50.50]I'm going to dump this one first.
[154:51.42]We're going to go this one straight dump into the pond.
[154:55.74]These are all going to the pond.
[154:56.74]I'm ready.
[154:57.64]Save this fucking shit.
[154:58.40]Let's go.
[155:12.13]Just get out.
[155:12.84]Go.
[155:13.02]There we go.
[155:14.06]Ready?
[155:14.20]Ready?
[155:16.16]One, two, three!
[155:43.27]Get off!
[155:49.58]Move this.
[155:51.78]Why is all this shit in the way?
[156:01.63]Why did I drive backwards?
[156:02.73]I don't know.
[156:03.57]I fucked up.
[156:09.43]Alright, let's do it.
[156:11.07]Just gotta get him to the pond.
[156:12.07]Just two more.
[156:20.84]Here we go.
[156:26.84]It's a pond.
[156:36.36]Get that pond!
[156:41.84]Alright.
[156:43.78]Stop it!
[156:46.33]I need another car here.
[156:47.55]I need another car to be able to take me- Wait, that's okay.
[156:56.40]Yeah, this is wrong.
[156:57.10]I gotta get another car.
[156:59.56]It's fucked up.
[157:00.16]I gotta get another car to go that way.
[157:05.32]I fucked it up.
[157:05.74]I was supposed to go straight over the thing.
[157:07.14]Remember I was gonna fly over.
[157:14.55]Alright, let me get this more erect.
[157:19.55]Let's put this car down here.
[157:27.76]I'm going to jump that.
[157:28.52]I need an escape car.
[157:33.20]Once I jump that, I'm going to end up like there.
[157:35.36]It's going to go in the ocean.
[157:38.43]Perfect opportunity.
[157:39.03]Okay, there is a car already here.
[157:40.59]We're going to go over here.
[157:45.39]Wait.
[158:03.13]Because I can just fly over that.
[158:05.51]Take that car back.
[158:06.43]I'm going to take that car back to here.
[158:09.62]And I'm just going to drive this one in the ocean.
[158:13.02]And then escape.
[158:15.14]Let's see if I can do it.
[158:17.02]Car on truck.
[158:21.68]Oh, shit.
[158:22.20]Give me that.
[158:25.65]Meat on bone.
[158:26.83]Meat on bone.
[158:29.73]It's a piano.
[158:30.41]What's a piano doing out here?
[158:46.66]Alright, so this would be two.
[158:56.84]And then we just need one more.
[158:57.86]That's it.
[158:58.70]And anything after that is icing on the cake.
[159:05.31]Hold on.
[159:05.75]If I go... Take this one.
[159:09.47]I'm gonna make enough room where I can just speed through that.
[159:11.59]I have my escape car.
[159:14.79]I might be able to get more than one.
[159:34.31]There's a car.
[159:37.11]There's a car.
[159:37.95]There's a car.
[159:38.81]There's a car.
[159:40.49]You see, Plucky, we're going to play our favorite game.
[159:44.64]It's called There's a Car.
[159:46.66]Anytime you see a car, Plucky, you say, there's a car.
[159:51.90]There's a car.
[159:52.74]There's a car.
[159:53.60]There's a car.
[159:54.50]There's a car.
[159:55.38]There's a car.
[159:56.16]Anyone know what that is?
[160:07.00]That's from Tiny Toons, How I Spent My Summer Vacation.
[160:12.27]Nice going, one person.
[160:13.35]How did I fuck that up?
[160:15.67]I have no idea.
[160:16.13]I could just end this right now.
[160:24.81]Alright.
[160:25.27]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[160:26.02]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[160:26.98]Watch this shit.
[160:29.20]You ready?
[160:30.80]I'm going straight this way.
[160:31.72]Ditch.
[160:32.12]Straight that way.
[160:32.82]Ditch.
[160:36.79]There's a car.
[160:37.63]There's a car.
[160:44.88]How do you unsubscribe?
[160:46.46]You better not.
[160:50.54]You're gonna unsubscribe?
[160:51.98]Better not.
[161:01.65]Open.
[161:03.09]Open!
[161:10.39]No, stupid game.
[161:16.19]Alright, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it.
[161:17.63]I'm good, I'm good, I'm leaving.
[161:19.32]Anymore?
[161:19.64]Nope, I'm done.
[161:30.40]Who watches Jerma in 2020?
[161:31.30]I don't know, man, you.
[161:35.46]Oh, coffee?
[161:41.57]Oh, this coffee's kind of gross.
[161:46.29]I'm now a trespasser.
[161:48.35]A new tool.
[161:48.95]Nice!
[161:49.47]I love this game!
[161:50.53]I love the tools!
[161:57.09]New tool.
[162:03.54]Who uses doors anymore?
[162:04.56]Planks?
[162:06.92]Planks can be used to build primitive ramps.
[162:09.70]You can also attach objects with planks to lift or drag heavy items.
[162:16.21]Really?
[162:16.47]Build complex structures.
[162:34.11]What the fuck?
[162:38.71]That's pretty cool.
[162:40.98]That's really cool, and then I can pick it up.
[162:51.22]Okay, they can attach to walls too.
[162:53.51]Nice.
[162:54.71]It stays there.
[162:55.35]Alright, that's cool.
[162:57.75]How much money do I have?
[163:04.61]600?
[163:05.21]No, nothing.
[163:10.22]Nothing?
[163:11.06]Nothing?
[163:11.66]Nothing?
[163:11.92]Nothing?
[163:13.06]Planks.
[163:14.28]Maximum length.
[163:16.28]Oh.
[163:16.42]I feel like I want maximum length.
[163:24.84]And more planks.
[163:26.90]Yeah.
[163:27.18]24 planks.
[163:30.12]Okay, what about this one?
[163:35.54]Speaking to the login device, I managed to find a connection to the West Point marina.
[163:38.18]I haven't been able to figure out more on BT, but Lee has a warehouse in West Point.
[163:43.76]I guess whatever fishy business he's up to, the marina is not the final destination.
[163:47.04]I was thinking the boat GPS devices can give me an idea where he's moving the product.
[163:51.52]Especially if I could compare their recent destinations to the shipping log.
[163:54.86]Can you get them?
[163:57.88]Shoot for quantity almost always.
[163:59.89]Okay.
[164:05.92]Steal the GPS device from Lee's boat.
[164:08.30]And get the log files.
[164:10.48]Watch the news?
[164:11.20]Ah!
[164:11.54]I keep forgetting to watch the fucking TV.
[164:13.94]Just spawn me in front of the TV.
[164:23.41]Okay.
[164:27.90]Log files in the office.
[164:30.08]Boat trailer.
[164:34.25]Okay, fishing boat.
[164:40.41]Secondary targets are boat and boathouse.
[164:45.57]Let's go to the office and just take a little peek of what we're working with here.
[164:56.74]I got my long planks.
[165:08.22]I still have VHS tape of how I spent my summer vacation.
[165:10.52]I remember renting that at Blockbuster over and over again.
[165:15.84]And sometimes it wouldn't be in, and I would be so pissed.
[165:22.18]Because there was only like one copy of that at Blockbuster.
[165:25.14]And those of you guys that don't know how Blockbuster worked, they had display cases.
[165:29.77]And if there was a second case behind the display case, that means that that was currently in, and you could rent it.
[165:37.37]So it was always so horrible when you would go into Blockbuster, and there would be a new game or a new movie that you want to watch, and it'd be two or three rows of these display cases, and none of them had a single secondary case behind them.
[165:52.54]It was just so defeating.
[165:54.04]Because then you had to rent something else, and it was like, I don't want to fucking rent something else.
[165:58.67]I don't want to rent the Glove Game 364.
[166:05.05]I rented that like five times in different places because they didn't have like Donkey Kong.
[166:17.94]Lover waiting room.
[166:18.80]Alright, what am I?
[166:20.80]I'm stealing something here.
[166:27.90]What am I stealing?
[166:30.86]All the way across the whole room.
[166:35.64]What are we stealing?
[166:43.35]Holy shit.
[166:44.79]Whoa!
[166:47.09]That was 400.
[166:48.13]What was that?
[166:48.69]Antique pirate dagger?
[166:50.09]Holy shit.
[166:53.53]Okay, be careful.
[166:54.09]I don't want to trigger this.
[166:54.80]Save this.
[167:00.52]This is gonna trigger.
[167:03.48]Same technique I did last time.
[167:06.41]Although... Hmm... Grab this.
[167:17.64]Steal the GPS out of there.
[167:19.86]And then steal the GPS out of here.
[167:23.34]And then fuck off.
[167:25.42]Is my escape?
[167:27.66]Alright.
[167:28.50]Let's just go for it.
[167:29.46]Whatever.
[167:29.70]Fuck it.
[167:29.96]Let's just try it.
[167:48.29]Little one.
[167:48.63]Little boat.
[167:55.47]This is too slow.
[167:56.25]This is really slow.
[168:03.15]Way too slow.
[168:04.21]Just burnt so much time.
[168:05.71]Fuck.
[168:16.18]What?
[168:16.46]No, take the... What the fuck are you doing?
[168:23.34]What?
[168:23.76]Wow.
[168:27.40]Oh, that is just not gonna happen.
[168:30.57]We're gonna plank the fuck out of this.
[168:50.89]I can't, right?
[169:01.64]No, I can't build a bridge.
[169:03.24]These are so slow.
[169:09.06]I need a faster boat.
[169:13.72]Okay, where's like a speedboat?
[169:17.57]I guess, could I dump?
[169:18.44]I'm gonna dump that in the ocean.
[169:21.18]Yeah, let's go.
[169:24.42]Big boat is fast, are you sure?
[169:28.12]Okay, it is.
[169:29.24]It's very fast.
[169:32.83]You have to commit to the bridge.
[169:33.91]It's not gonna work.
[169:35.07]I only have 24 planks.
[169:35.69]Alright, but not, hold on a second.
[169:41.03]I want to go examine this.
[169:46.79]It shaves off at least 10 seconds.
[169:50.35]Alright.
[169:50.71]I've got an idea.
[169:51.38]Here's my idea.
[169:57.52]I got to get over this thing.
[169:59.74]So I got to steal the GPS out of here.
[170:09.89]Why not?
[170:10.65]It's okay.
[170:12.65]Why not just bring this all the way back?
[170:17.62]Put it in the water?
[170:18.46]Yeah, just put it in the water.
[170:32.87]Yeah, I'll just have this be the last thing I do for the escape.
[170:35.82]That's not a bad idea.
[170:50.90]okay now it's the escape right there this is a Family Guy joke how wait how is this a Family Guy joke
[171:20.61]Why did I think that backing this up was a good fucking idea?
[171:24.76]Somebody tell me.
[171:40.37]There we go.
[171:40.97]Alright.
[171:41.57]Now that one's ready to do the last.
[171:48.09]I can do this one second to last.
[171:50.03]But what the hell is going on here?
[171:51.60]I think I'm gonna build a bridge.
[171:53.88]You know what?
[171:54.30]Just... I wonder if I can build a bridge from here to the boat.
[172:00.96]Because I need to steal this.
[172:10.85]Wait, can I just... Can I drop this into the water?
[172:13.35]Okay.
[172:33.76]Get off!
[172:39.74]What are you attached to?
[172:46.34]Get off!
[172:47.42]Stop it, please!
[172:48.96]You're making me look so bad right now.
[172:52.88]What is it still attached to?
[172:56.44]No!
[172:56.96]I wouldn't want to pick that up!
[173:03.87]I didn't want to pick- I wanted to-
[173:30.06]Alright, now get this in the water.
[173:33.76]I can't drive this.
[173:36.59]Can't drive the boat.
[173:42.19]I can carry it though.
[174:02.35]Worst possible way.
[174:03.95]Really?
[174:04.21]Alright, let's drag this back to the truck.
[174:14.27]We gotta get this.
[174:14.91]That's good.
[174:15.49]This is optional.
[174:26.00]You're like a dog with a stick.
[174:29.16]Oh, shit.
[174:29.58]I gotta... Wait.
[174:31.02]I'm not gonna waste this.
[174:39.45]Can I fit through that?
[174:40.15]Cut the ends.
[174:52.27]If only I was as smart as you.
[174:56.53]Oh yeah, I'm playing chess and you're playing- I'm playing checkers, you're playing chess.
[175:13.86]Alright.
[175:14.76]So here is target number two.
[175:17.68]So there's grab that, grab that, escape.
[175:23.12]What else is there?
[175:29.14]We have to grab this, take the fast boat over here.
[175:32.68]No, there's nothing else over here.
[175:34.97]Grab this, take the fast boat here.
[175:45.07]Oh shit.
[175:46.39]Okay, we gotta get that too.
[176:04.83]Drive big boat?
[176:05.81]I will.
[176:06.07]Just burn it all to the ground, Jeremy.
[176:11.43]No.
[176:11.67]Am I gonna burn it all to the ground?
[176:16.41]Okay, this one is... Well, let's do a little experiment here.
[176:21.97]Nope.
[176:43.16]Hmm.
[176:56.22]Now what if... Okay.
[177:02.76]I can raise the bridge.
[177:05.70]I can drive through here.
[177:08.80]And just... This has to be the last thing I do.
[177:10.92]Because if I start up here...
[177:21.50]Get that.
[177:22.26]60 seconds.
[177:23.28]Go this way.
[177:25.40]I still haven't figured out what the hell has to happen here.
[177:28.10]Get that.
[177:28.48]I have another boat parked right here.
[177:31.58]So we go... Get that... Get that... Click, click, click, click, done.
[177:43.74]Let's keep that in mind.
[177:47.04]I can drive the big boat.
[177:48.30]Well, let's find out.
[177:49.30]Let's take a look.
[177:58.51]What is the big boat?
[178:04.72]That's inefficient.
[178:05.58]I'm not looking for efficiency.
[178:06.82]I'm looking for completion.
[178:23.31]The laws of physics.
[179:08.34]Someone needs to hold this for me.
[179:47.81]Okay.
[179:52.71]I can drive this.
[179:55.78]Wait, what about secret?
[179:59.30]Yep.
[180:01.08]$400.
[180:01.10]$40.
[180:01.12]I don't know.
[180:04.46]Was that the engine?
[180:05.24]I don't know.
[180:10.52]Inefficient.
[180:11.26]I don't care about efficiency.
[180:12.20]I just want to beat it.
[180:13.68]I want to complete it.
[180:14.38]I don't care about efficiency.
[180:19.18]Okay, this can be driven.
[180:22.17]Where do I want this?
[180:23.19]So I gotta take that GPS.
[180:26.31]Let's get it over here.
[180:27.93]Oh, this is done.
[180:28.74]This is done.
[180:30.10]This is done.
[180:30.92]This is done.
[180:32.44]What's wrong with the boat?
[180:34.88]Oh, I have to like smash the thing.
[180:57.13]And now... This is done.
[180:59.73]I just did it.
[181:00.21]I got all the conditions.
[181:03.60]What the fuck is going on?
[181:07.06]Is there... No, there's another cable right here.
[181:08.80]Are you kidding me?
[181:12.12]Let go of me.
[181:12.76]How am I gonna get back on?
[181:19.13]Fuck.
[181:19.65]I need another bridge.
[181:34.68]Okay.
[181:49.23]Easy, come on.
[181:50.75]Come on, don't do it.
[181:51.51]Alright.
[181:55.16]Watch out for the f- Iceberg.
[182:07.74]Okay, so this is good.
[182:08.98]I just have to get this in the right spot.
[182:13.10]Over here.
[182:19.03]That looks good.
[182:20.01]One, two, three, four.
[182:22.81]This is the last thing on the list.
[182:24.05]So I have to get this thing.
[182:26.93]This thing is way too slow.
[182:28.29]I need the fast boat here.
[182:29.47]So I'm going to park this thing.
[182:31.37]Who cares?
[182:31.63]I'm going to make a... Wait, I have to raise the bridge.
[182:42.16]Can I like shoot it from here?
[182:43.00]Okay.
[182:56.77]Okay.
[183:10.82]Ah, shit.
[183:11.36]I almost had it.
[183:30.38]Come on, get out of the way.
[183:37.45]Shit.
[183:37.63]I stand on top of it.
[183:44.97]What the fuck even is this?
[183:45.77]This is like the Blair Witch Project thing.
[183:47.68]I'm... Whatever, fuck it.
[184:07.44]Bridge is up.
[184:19.56]Pretty sick.
[184:21.28]Now... It's shitting.
[184:26.98]Oh, don't say that.
[184:27.70]It does look like a goldfish shitting.
[184:30.34]One of the weirdest things to ever look at.
[184:31.72]When a goldfish shits, it's just so strange.
[184:38.67]Okay.
[184:39.41]Stay right there!
[184:39.91]Don't move!
[185:01.40]Alright, we're good.
[185:05.87]So... 1, 2, 3, 4...
[185:10.42]What is this?
[185:11.96]Oh, okay.
[185:12.30]I thought those were objectives.
[185:13.40]They're just tables.
[185:15.20]Alright.
[185:15.96]It's time to put this plane in motion.
[185:20.95]In here.
[185:22.55]I need this boat.
[185:23.63]This is the fast one.
[185:25.33]Grab it.
[185:26.99]Speed this way.
[185:28.65]Grab this boat.
[185:29.57]Speed this way.
[185:30.41]Collect, collect, collect, collect, collect.
[185:32.19]End.
[185:40.07]I need that boat.
[185:54.95]I'll save it.
[185:55.33]Yeah, I will.
[185:59.73]I need that tail.
[186:00.81]What is that from?
[186:02.41]I need that tail.
[186:03.05]I need that claw.
[186:04.73]What is it?
[186:06.05]What is that from?
[186:20.98]It's from me, but what is it?
[186:27.56]It's a hilarious Monster Hunter bit.
[186:31.88]Alright, you didn't put hilarious in quotes, so... I think you actually, you thought that was funny.
[186:49.44]Monster Hunter is weeb trash.
[186:53.58]That game's fun.
[186:55.10]What?
[186:55.36]Alright, I'm ready.
[187:00.47]It's time.
[187:00.95]Get the hell up here.
[187:07.73]Steal.
[187:08.31]Drive.
[187:08.99]Steal.
[187:09.91]Drive.
[187:10.27]Don't fall.
[187:15.86]What the fuck?
[187:17.64]Oh, there's a hole here.
[187:20.67]VIP that guy?
[187:21.89]Why would I VIP that guy?
[187:23.85]He said something incredibly bad that I didn't like.
[187:28.13]Okay, this is it.
[187:29.95]Save the game here.
[187:30.57]So we'll go in here.
[187:31.27]Bang.
[187:32.03]Drive this straight through here to this boat.
[187:34.14]Bang.
[187:34.66]Drive back.
[187:35.28]Collect, collect, collect, collect.
[187:36.52]Out.
[187:42.18]One.
[187:43.12]Two.
[187:44.06]Three.
[187:59.47]Get out of the boat.
[188:10.38]Hooray!
[188:12.24]Okay, then we're gonna transfer to this boat.
[188:14.54]Transfer!
[188:17.81]One.
[188:40.01]That's it, right?
[188:40.53]I did them all?
[188:44.65]Yeah.
[188:49.90]Sick.
[188:57.08]That was pretty much E rank.
[188:59.19]There's no ranks in this game.
[189:00.21]You just have to get it done.
[189:05.17]I do see new high score of 5.
[189:06.61]I feel like that's very low.
[189:11.67]I hope that's not out of a hundred.
[189:13.13]Look at how sloppy this was.
[189:19.40]Ah, that could have been cleaned up.
[189:22.46]Just look at how bad this is.
[189:24.48]This is terrible.
[189:25.18]Okay, at this point in the line, I took drugs.
[189:29.18]You know what I mean?
[189:30.38]It started to kick in.
[189:32.96]Yeah.
[189:33.92]Clearly.
[189:35.03]Clearly it started to really kick in about here.
[189:41.49]How much money do I have?
[189:47.84]Oh, only then is when you took drugs.
[189:51.88]Right.
[189:52.64]TV.
[189:57.15]Marina and several boats were damaged yesterday as thieves broke in and got away with expensive...
[190:08.41]GPS navigation units.
[190:11.35]Harbormaster Jim Delish says the marina has been subject to a string of vandalism and burglary incidents lately.
[190:22.04]New tool, right?
[190:28.17]What is it?
[190:31.59]Pipe bombs?
[190:40.09]Oh my goodness, this is fun.
[190:41.77]Okay, I upgrade the pipe bombs.
[190:43.15]How come there's no upgrades for these?
[190:51.43]Really, really glad I spent like 500 bucks on this useless thing to upgrade the fuel count.
[190:58.12]Great.
[191:00.30]Last rounds.
[191:07.51]I want these so bad.
[191:08.39]Yeah, 18.
[191:11.78]If they leave those GPS devices, it would be a shame to open that demolition investigation, wouldn't it?
[191:16.13]Didn't I just do that?
[191:19.79]Thanks for taking care of the GPS device.
[191:20.99]Just one problem.
[191:21.99]They seem to be of a new, more secure type, and I can't find out their recent locations without the decryption key.
[191:30.72]My best bet is that Lee keeps the decryption key in his office safe.
[191:34.88]But it might also be in that production safe.
[191:36.94]I have one last favor to ask of you, and I think you already know what that might be.
[191:42.80]The lifting.
[191:45.38]GPS decryption key is in Lee's safe.
[191:47.16]Move the safe to your escape vehicle.
[191:49.72]If possible, also get... Is something on fire?
[192:00.71]Yes, my house.
[192:03.07]Right.
[192:03.47]Okay.
[192:04.89]Well... Run?
[192:09.23]No, I can take care of it.
[192:20.99]I can't.
[192:22.27]What happens if this happens?
[192:24.71]What happens?
[192:25.19]Is this going to be alright?
[192:26.81]Okay.
[192:44.12]Ow!
[192:44.64]I'm sorry.
[192:45.04]That hurt.
[192:51.67]Smash my fucking hand.
[192:52.75]Okay, so now, let's take a look.
[192:57.35]Hmm.
[192:58.81]The GPS decryption key is in Lee's safe.
[193:01.36]Move the safe to your escape vehicle.
[193:03.88]If possible, also get the other safe and pick up all key cabinets.
[193:09.48]This safe is too heavy.
[193:10.60]Okay, I'm going to pick the safe up with this claw.
[193:15.70]Sounds easy enough.
[193:16.32]Alright, office safe is right here.
[193:17.66]Let's go take a look at the claw.
[193:20.39]Drop it here.
[193:29.01]Probably money up here.
[193:32.05]Aww, really?
[193:42.13]Wait, no!
[193:42.87]I'm gonna do the thing.
[193:43.53]I'm gonna play chess.
[193:44.67]Okay.
[194:03.17]That's cash right there.
[194:04.11]That's a wrench.
[194:06.47]Whatever that word is.
[194:07.17]Don't open?
[194:14.48]Nothing even in that.
[194:15.40]What?
[194:15.56]Here's a dump truck.
[194:21.13]I could put the safe in here.
[194:22.23]I really wanted to.
[194:30.89]Alright, this is kind of like the fun part of Minecraft without having to play Minecraft.
[194:34.33]100 bucks.
[194:48.48]I don't have to build a house.
[194:50.86]I can just break blocks with my mining pick.
[194:53.96]It's like more fun.
[194:58.80]You're a griefer.
[195:01.18]griefing simulator Minecraft grief simulator alright what can I do with this I feel like I can make a bridge with this hold on hold on let's take don't stop rushing just get out there and take it and just survey the area for a little bit you're good must be locked well and that just too bad
[195:32.64]Would I have just done that to the lock?
[195:46.20]Yes.
[195:46.46]Oh, well.
[195:48.13]Alright.
[195:48.35]Let's take a look.
[195:49.07]Let's see if there's any valuables.
[195:50.73]Hmm.
[196:00.27]Valuables in the couch.
[196:03.63]Valuable is in the valuable machine.
[196:05.13]No money.
[196:12.30]No.
[196:14.94]There it is.
[196:16.26]200 bucks.
[196:16.76]Bathroom?
[196:24.59]Toilet?
[196:25.83]No.
[196:25.93]No.
[196:30.57]Say... I don't know.
[196:31.75]I'm not going to say a random word that I don't know what it means.
[196:33.73]That thing just... I cut the thing in half.
[196:42.90]That's how you get the money.
[196:55.52]Does it say what?
[196:58.14]Does it say something?
[196:59.59]What did it say?
[197:04.72]Going to race.
[197:05.38]Attic is off limits.
[197:07.63]Really?

[198:11.54]There's nothing up here.
[198:16.94]Why'd you say that?
[198:17.88]There's nothing even here.
[198:22.78]I already got it.
[198:23.90]Oh, shit.
[198:24.68]I thought of like a reset.
[198:25.52]40 bucks.
[198:34.72]Capitalism trophy.
[198:36.00]Whatever that was.
[198:49.62]Nothing.
[198:50.96]Paper jam.
[198:52.16]Oh, something there.
[198:52.98]What is it?
[198:54.40]There's something there.
[198:54.92]I saw it.
[198:55.24]Did you see it?
[198:57.74]I swear to God, something was here.
[199:07.43]Shit.
[199:07.69]Okay, well, whatever.
[199:08.29]So this is the safe.
[199:13.65]We obviously have a few ways to do this.
[199:17.70]I'll break that.
[199:19.56]Okay.
[199:20.98]So, I can load the safe onto the back of the... I just beat the level.
[199:24.79]I just beat it.
[199:50.78]Okay.
[199:50.88]I'm going to drop the safe out the window onto the truck.
[199:55.66]Okay.
[200:25.31]That's safe.
[200:26.61]There it is.
[200:27.05]Alright.
[200:28.99]Now, if I can... Wait.
[200:35.74]Use the dump truck?
[200:38.34]Yeah.
[200:39.59]Yeah, but hold on.
[200:41.11]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[201:00.85]Okay, that looks good.
[201:07.44]Gonna drop it in there.
[201:08.62]Is that set up for this?
[201:12.60]That's that one.
[201:13.34]What's this over here?
[201:14.16]This is another safe.
[201:21.02]Alright, we're gonna jump towards that one.
[201:22.56]Alright, um...
[201:30.48]Just a key cabinet, I can steal that.
[201:37.86]Okay.
[201:38.66]Let me just see if this works.
[201:53.14]This place is fucking filthy.
[202:06.89]I gotta clean the place up.
[202:11.10]There's too much debris everywhere.
[202:12.96]I have to get rid of it.
[202:13.70]Look, it's just a joke.
[202:16.78]It's getting caught on everything.
[202:32.21]What a massive cleanup job I just gave myself.
[202:41.47]No?
[202:41.75]Okay, if you hit it again, it just disintegrates.
[202:43.65]There we go.
[202:54.07]Cool.
[202:54.33]Alright, we're good.
[202:59.80]Shotgun the fuck out of this?
[203:11.36]Right there.
[203:12.49]Okay, let's see if this works.
[203:17.95]Holy shit, that's 400.
[203:19.25]Okay.
[203:42.89]Where's the escape car?
[203:47.52]Right there.
[204:04.09]You know what?
[204:05.43]I don't even care.
[204:06.23]I'm done.
[204:14.86]I got like 800 bucks through the walls and shit.
[204:21.33]That makes up for the other objectives I didn't do.
[204:27.39]Minimum, minimum, minimum.
[204:28.89]No, just for that one.
[204:34.88]I just made a thousand dollars.
[204:35.98]I have 900 bucks.
[204:36.76]What are you talking about?
[204:43.02]Lee Chemicals suffered, is the place still on fire?
[204:45.20]Another spectacular break-in last night where properties were damaged and the perpetrators got away with heavy security equipment.
[204:59.91]According to the police, what is happening to Lockell?
[205:05.94]Do you need locks for your locks now?
[205:10.24]Says CEO Lawrence Lee Jr.
[205:19.69]Turn this shit off.
[205:25.55]Thanks.
[205:25.81]Now I just need to find someone who can work a safe.
[205:27.51]I'll get back to you in a bit and let you know how it goes.
[205:29.33]Okay.
[205:29.51]What about tools?
[205:35.58]I think I want to do the shotgun.
[205:37.56]I like this a lot.
[205:38.30]And I want more damage.
[205:41.22]More damage and more rounds.
[205:45.84]And more rounds in the pipe bomb.
[205:49.69]Golden.
[205:51.55]How much damage is it though?
[205:52.51]Let's find out.
[205:56.17]Hmm.
[205:59.11]I mean, is it that much more than it was before?
[206:03.33]Pipe bombs.
[206:07.35]Oh yeah, let's test that.
[206:16.59]I can die.
[206:20.27]Alright, that worked.
[206:25.31]What's next?
[206:25.97]Gordon.
[206:26.71]Ooh, water tower.
[206:27.91]I still don't know how, but Lee found out about the cars and totally overreacted.
[206:32.34]I just saved the life of those poor cars and it goes completely mental and vandalizes my property.
[206:39.05]Can you believe that?
[206:39.81]Good thing I'm properly insured.
[206:42.15]I thought about ways to get back at him and finally nailed it.
[206:44.93]The iconic water tower at Lee Chemicals.
[206:47.73]His grandfather built it with his bare hands, and it has since become a symbol for the entire Lee family.
[206:53.08]They even use it in their logo type.
[206:55.34]Making that tower a little less tall would be a suitable symbol for the small man he is.
[206:59.96]Hmm.
[207:03.42]Tower.
[207:04.48]Gordon wants you to get back at Lee by making his iconic tower shorter.
[207:08.66]Remove the upper part of the tower.
[207:13.85]The fire.
[207:14.35]Yeah, I didn't even look at it.
[207:15.37]Assumed it was there.
[207:16.95]What is all this?
[207:20.41]Bomb?
[207:41.04]No, no, no.
[207:42.22]I have pipe bombs though.
[207:45.09]Who cares?
[207:46.18]What do you mean?
[207:47.24]The water tower.
[207:49.26]The tower.
[207:50.96]Yeah, watch this.
[208:01.79]Up there, right?
[208:02.37]This is going to be fucking easy.
[209:14.86]Oh, wait.
[209:22.68]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[209:24.30]Let's plank this up.
[209:39.60]What's the timer on this?
[209:41.30]Uh...
[209:47.54]Thank you.
[210:32.34]Doom Eternal.
[210:33.42]No!
[210:40.74]Fall!
[210:47.17]Why isn't it falling?
[210:52.17]Why is it?
[210:52.73]Why is it?
[210:53.65]What?
[210:59.37]What?
[211:01.43]What's keeping this up?
[211:07.26]Oh, there's one pe- Alright, hold on.
[211:08.40]Ready?
[211:10.00]This is where I save the game.
[211:17.50]How did I end up inside?
[211:28.30]Like a squished inside the edge Holy shit, let me go.
[211:33.68]I'm gonna go to the chute dude watch this.
[211:36.14]Holy shit.
[211:36.52]It's gonna be fucking awesome.
[211:39.32]Oh my god ready I can't fit Wait I I took it down I shaved it down
[212:12.98]Wait, so... Did I push it?
[212:24.79]I really did just play Jenga.
[212:35.19]Whoa!
[212:35.71]Alright.
[212:39.73]I did it.
[212:48.28]Still too tall?
[213:08.01]Why am I so lazy that I won't even do this the right way?
[213:12.36]I'm so lazy.
[213:13.90]You know what?
[213:14.24]Just get me in the fucking side door.
[213:15.84]I don't care.
[213:29.21]So what's the problem?
[213:50.17]Why do I think I could reach?
[213:56.57]There's a part above the line.
[213:59.91]Okay, hold on.
[214:00.39]I thought that was secret hidden stuff.
[214:12.40]It might be.
[214:17.94]I want money, man.
[214:21.67]Okay, so I'm up here.
[214:22.63]Alright.
[214:25.53]It's connected right there.
[214:27.33]It's connected right there.
[214:30.31]Fuck, it's too far away.
[214:31.63]It's hanging by a thread.
[214:34.97]Bomb?
[214:40.29]I don't want to blow up the whole tower.
[214:54.38]Oh, 20 bucks.
[214:56.50]Hold on.
[214:57.51]I think I just gave myself an opportunity.
[215:07.50]That's an opportunity right there.
[215:08.44]Get out of the way.
[215:21.23]Here we go!
[215:22.63]I can cut it from here.
[215:26.99]Cut it down!
[215:28.59]Cut it down, please!
[215:34.52]Oh, shit!
[215:39.65]Alright, it's been disconnected.
[215:40.55]It's still... 0.9 meters too tall?
[215:56.66]What?
[216:04.94]Thank god, there's like a weird loony toons hole.
[216:13.54]Yes!
[216:14.08]Alright, it's this piece right here.
[216:24.57]Okay, is that the only one?
[216:25.47]I don't have any more shotguns.
[216:36.56]0.5 meters too tall.

[216:54.38]Shit.
[216:56.52]It's not soft locked.
[216:57.26]I was going to throw shit at it.
[217:16.85]I need something bigger.
[217:18.11]Give me this.

[225:11.08]What the hell is up with this door?
[225:21.25]Steal the toilets.
[225:22.21]I don't think I can do that.
[225:31.58]What is with this weird Scooby-Doo house?
[225:43.64]What the fuck is this?
[225:51.89]I don't think I should have done that.
[225:52.75]I don't know what that was, but maybe I should have broken that.
[225:57.67]That was some portal shit.
[226:07.56]You just freed it.
[226:08.44]There's nothing even up here.
[226:11.58]Alright, I'm out.
[226:19.95]Let's go.
[226:24.61]Destroy the dam.
[226:25.53]Are you nuts?

[227:11.75]Okay, you're super blind on the roof.
[227:17.11]Is this a laser?
[227:19.03]A distance laser is only worth $140.
[227:20.89]I found wallets with more money in that.
[227:27.31]Alright, I'm going.
[227:27.85]Is it going to kill me?
[227:49.69]Too tight.
[228:03.66]Drive the truck into the dam.
[228:05.46]Well, I can't really do that anymore, can I?
[228:07.44]How much CBD oil did you take?
[228:12.98]None.
[228:14.10]I have none today.
[228:15.29]Zero.
[228:15.51]Zero.
[228:18.58]Blow up the dam.
[228:19.48]That's not the mission.
[228:20.68]That might be the mission next or something.
[228:22.89]I don't want to spoil the mission.
[228:25.07]Plus that weird explosive blue sphere.
[228:31.84]It's going to be the next mission.
[228:32.96]Just watch.
[228:39.94]There's also a sandbox mode.
[228:41.14]Yeah, that looks pretty cool too.
[228:45.08]Can you do a porky pig impression?
[228:47.28]That's all, folks.
[228:50.01]Not very good.
[229:00.87]That was mega bad.
[229:07.93]Whatever.
[229:08.63]What's all this?
[229:09.17]Drugs?
[229:19.10]super blast super blast and all I can do looking better they turned the gas back on coffee never tasted better I was skeptical about working with Mr. wu in the first place but he does pay well so does the new client lee chemicals did they contact you directly by the way I heard on the news there's uh some madman on the loose around here hope you remember to lock the door at night
[229:47.38]Okay, Gordon really took this shit a step too far.
[229:50.10]You've probably heard it on the news, but he hit my tower.
[229:53.87]The Lee Tower.
[229:55.31]My poor grandfather's probably turning in his grave right now.
[229:58.59]It'll cost me a fortune to rebuild that.
[230:02.12]back at Gordon, but he's so loaded with money that whatever I do, he'll just pay someone to fix it.
[230:07.30]They land way to get to him.
[230:08.96]Strike where his fat wallet can't protect him.
[230:11.58]His precious art collection.
[230:14.22]Some of those paintings would also make a nice contribution to the restoration fund for my new tower.
[230:20.96]Also, by the way, there's some construction work going on at the marina.
[230:24.06]I've seen a lot of high-end tools laying around.
[230:26.56]I could actually use some of them for rebuilding the tower.
[230:28.42]Mind going there and getting some?
[230:32.39]No.
[230:33.01]Get that on your own time.
[230:33.85]I won't fucking steal the artwork.
[230:37.51]There is a lot of stuff to do here.
[230:40.05]Steal at least four paintings from the art museum.
[230:45.29]Are you high?
[230:45.93]Be honest.
[230:46.39]No.
[230:47.47]But I am going to take a break and go pee and get some water.
[230:51.22]In about four hours, I have not gone to the bathroom.
[230:53.46]I'll be right back.
[234:37.39]Sorry, that took a little longer.
[234:38.41]I drank a full water.
[234:41.89]And I refilled it and drank it again.
[234:48.59]How was the bong rip?
[234:52.27]It's fine.
[234:53.27]It was fine.
[234:59.39]Okay, let's keep going here.
[235:01.12]Come back over, why don't you?
[235:06.58]Alright.
[235:10.58]Available targets.
[235:14.61]So, steal all the paintings.
[235:17.51]Steal at least four paintings.
[235:22.87]Okay.
[235:23.83]They're pretty spread out, too.
[235:24.93]Alright, time to investigate.

[237:01.31]Let's go to house two.
[237:08.19]Alright, let's check this one first.
[237:10.31]There's a painting in here.
[237:22.77]Alright, that could not have been uglier.
[237:24.67]That was the most non-clean.
[237:26.87]Oh, look at these fast cars.
[237:27.78]Okay.
[237:29.40]So, pick it up.
[237:31.08]Do I have to deliver it anywhere, or do I just have to get them?
[237:35.26]Just take them.
[237:36.06]That's it, right?
[237:36.80]I don't have to drop them off anywhere.
[237:38.44]I just get them.
[237:39.44]Just take them.
[237:46.44]30 bucks.
[237:47.70]Is this a joystick?
[237:52.23]Alright, let's get her out.
[237:52.87]That's a... I like that painting.
[237:55.41]That's like one coin.
[238:01.79]I'm playing this shit out.
[238:03.45]Extremely fast car.
[238:09.78]Worthless?
[238:11.46]Worthless.
[238:15.24]Alright, we got a very fast car, which we can steal, drive straight,
[238:21.11]Or drive over here.
[238:22.15]Wait, can I make a... Hmm, hold on.
[238:26.74]Hold on just a second.
[238:55.18]That's not gonna work.
[238:57.50]I didn't even want... Just make a ramp up the stairs.
[239:07.05]There are literally stairs right there.
[239:08.43]I know.
[239:08.85]I just... Seeing if I could just... Like up there.
[239:11.57]Okay.
[239:13.61]Drive up these stairs.
[239:14.48]Okay.
[239:16.80]Drive up.
[239:18.80]Get out of car here.
[239:20.12]What is here?
[239:20.42]What is here?
[239:26.54]Did we get four of these fucking things?
[239:28.21]Okay, there's one right there.
[239:33.13]There's the donut.
[239:33.89]Steal that one.
[239:37.27]So that's one.
[239:37.93]Alright, I can go... Looks like I'm gonna... I'm probably gonna go like this, right?
[239:45.50]You would assume that I would go... I'd start on the left and go all the way and then drive to the boat.
[239:50.46]That's probably the idea.
[240:02.76]That's a muffin?
[240:03.38]That's not a muffin.
[240:07.86]Coffee maker.
[240:11.25]Oysters.
[240:12.77]Silverware.
[240:13.37]Nice.
[240:13.73]Alright, I'm making some money.
[240:14.47]This is good.
[240:21.47]Nothing.
[240:23.42]Nothing.
[240:23.64]Expensive.
[240:25.36]Expensive.
[240:25.60]Expensive.
[240:26.08]Nothing expensive.
[240:28.04]Nothing expensive.
[240:32.37]Give me something expensive now.
[240:43.72]Ooh, holy shit.
[240:46.20]Now that's a Simpsons car.
[240:50.17]That's a Homer Simpson car.
[241:05.57]Is this supposed to be The Simpsons house?
[241:06.89]No.
[241:10.38]I think I... Okay, so one, two.
[241:15.92]Okay, let's back this up.
[241:18.30]A good idea.
[241:19.14]Oh, check this shit out.
[241:19.84]We're gonna Simpsons the fuck out of this.
[241:23.13]I'm gonna leave this car here.
[241:24.09]If I can get the one here.
[241:27.73]No, I wanted to go in the elevator.
[241:33.37]Bring it back down.
[241:37.45]Why do I... I am Evil Homer.
[241:39.95]I am Evil Homer.
[241:42.86]What is that from?
[241:43.34]Oh, a card table.
[241:51.28]There's some blackjack.
[241:56.31]Nothing expensive here.
[241:57.37]I hate these.
[241:59.25]The lights underneath.
[242:01.37]Puke-inducing, fluorescent, weird neon lights.
[242:04.01]Get rid of them.
[242:04.57]All of them.
[242:15.81]Okay.
[242:18.70]Popcorn machine?
[242:20.26]You have a popcorn machine?
[242:21.30]That's awesome!
[242:28.36]Popcorn machine maintenance utility?
[242:37.94]Coffee?
[242:44.88]Under the table?
[242:45.86]Which one?
[242:53.74]Under the blackjack table?
[242:59.24]How to become a snooker champ.
[243:02.18]Oh, this is a pool.
[243:02.94]Alright.
[243:05.73]The expense of alcohol.
[243:14.80]I think I have his own drive-in movie theater.
[243:18.89]I guess it's just a regular movie theater.
[243:21.13]Why would this be drive-in?
[243:22.67]Oh, well, I'll show you how.
[243:30.66]No, I thought it was on the ground floor.
[243:31.98]I was going to say, yeah, it could be a drive-in movie theater if I want it to be.
[243:45.69]582 bucks.
[243:53.06]Oven?
[243:56.08]Oh, well.
[243:57.80]Oh, okay.
[243:58.26]Here's one right here.
[243:58.94]Alright, so.
[244:00.86]That's one.
[244:04.39]This one's kind of all the way back here, though.
[244:10.13]Please spend the next 20 minutes driving all the way up there.
[244:15.07]I don't think I can even do that.
[244:16.43]I'll break the boards when I drive over it.
[244:17.73]Alright.
[244:22.41]Grab, grab, grab, grab.
[244:24.69]R. Alright, hold on.
[244:27.92]Let me, let me... We're gonna make some room here.
[244:31.14]Can I go?
[244:41.01]Hold on.
[244:45.42]What is, like, through here?
[244:46.46]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[245:01.45]Leave this.
[245:01.97]Don't break that.
[245:02.51]Okay, so then I can go this way.
[245:09.22]Smash this shit.
[245:10.02]There's one in here.
[245:15.80]Okay.
[245:16.56]There's one in here, too.
[245:19.07]Where's this one?
[245:23.95]120 bucks.
[245:24.41]That's a lot.
[245:26.91]Is this one upstairs?
[245:27.67]Is this your favorite number?
[245:35.34]Um, I don't know.
[245:37.02]Three.
[245:41.53]I think I'm just gonna go for it.
[245:43.68]Wait, because then I can go 1, 2, 3, 4.
[245:46.40]Hold on.
[245:58.33]Oh, yeah.
[245:58.73]Hell yeah.
[245:59.01]Okay.
[246:05.20]Grab this one.
[246:06.48]Straight through there.
[246:08.48]Grab that one.
[246:10.02]Out the window.
[246:12.00]Into the car.
[246:13.87]Down here.
[246:15.63]Grab that one, grab that one, grab that one, and we're out.
[246:18.39]Let's give it a try.
[246:25.18]Not yet.
[246:27.28]More valuables.
[246:27.90]Words are hard.
[246:28.56]Valuables, not valuables.
[246:29.90]Valuables.
[246:43.69]I promise I am not high right now.
[246:45.79]I swear on everything.
[246:59.08]Hmm?
[247:00.97]Hmm?
[247:02.97]Oh, good.
[247:04.61]Makeup.
[247:09.57]Okay.
[247:11.33]Let's get a shot.
[247:25.46]I don't remember where this one is.
[247:27.64]Fuck.
[247:28.26]Do it again.
[247:31.58]Base camp?
[247:32.10]No, I don't have a shirt on.
[247:39.81]Let's go.
[247:54.22]So far, so good.
[247:54.84]Let's go.
[248:00.09]WAIT!
[248:05.67]That didn't even- What did I even do that for?
[248:07.14]Where's- This one in here, isn't there?
[248:08.42]There is one in here.
[248:10.26]Where is it?
[248:10.78]I gotta get this down.
[248:11.78]It's up there.
[248:12.48]Okay, hold on.
[248:12.94]I fucked it up.
[248:21.81]Beatbox The Simpsons intro.
[248:27.77]This person's just dead.
[248:48.57]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[248:50.19]Inefficient!
[248:50.91]Inefficient using stairs.
[248:52.68]Using a fucking staircase.
[248:58.45]And now what?
[248:59.05]I don't know what's next.
[249:00.59]Oh, the gazebo!
[249:07.43]I need a car!
[249:10.11]This is so inefficient.
[249:11.48]This is horrible.
[249:12.04]Do it again.
[249:15.76]You know what?
[249:16.44]Fuck going upstairs, but driving right by this and going to the gazebo.
[249:43.71]Oh, why are you stuck here?
[249:45.59]Oh, no.
[249:53.17]Minimum.
[249:54.45]Minimum.
[249:55.79]Minimum.
[250:09.70]Show ankles?
[250:11.34]What the?
[250:11.76]Why do you want?
[250:12.44]Why?
[250:14.11]Let's show ankles.
[250:23.51]Oh, fuck.
[250:31.39]I need a car.
[250:31.87]I need a car.
[250:32.23]I need a car.
[250:32.59]I need a car right now.
[250:33.33]Give me a car.
[250:37.49]I need a car.
[250:41.12]CORE! CORE! CORE! CORE! CORE! CORE! CORE! CORE!
[251:12.25]I got this first part down.
[251:18.47]The idea is you grab this shit.
[251:23.36]And then just keep driving.
[251:24.64]Alright, I gotta keep- I have to keep The Simpsons car.
[251:27.72]Simpsons car is the key to all this.
[251:30.18]It's the key to all this.
[251:48.54]Come on.
[251:53.22]What's with this weird computer thing?
[251:54.70]Because that was weird.
[251:56.53]Alright, I kept the car.
[252:02.75]It's so laggy.
[252:04.37]I can't even drive it.
[252:06.99]I just, like, stuffed... I don't think my dog does.
[252:10.49]This is just a pair of covers.
[252:11.59]He just stuffed his face under it.
[252:22.14]Minimum.
[252:23.38]Minimum.
[252:24.68]Minimum.
[252:32.69]This should be motorcycles.
[252:33.87]I've reset already, right?
[252:40.56]Reset.
[252:51.24]Okay.
[252:52.14]Okay.
[252:52.92]I gotta go break that shit.
[252:55.28]I'm clearing that up.
[252:58.52]You know what I'm saying?
[252:59.12]I'm clear.
[252:59.78]Like, that's just gonna fuck me up every time.
[253:12.18]Wait.
[253:34.62]I can just jump this.
[253:47.01]Does anybody feel like this should be doing more damage?
[253:49.99]Why?
[253:50.27]It's a bunch of flowers.
[254:36.86]DON'T!
[254:50.33]Why can't I just burn this?
[255:25.33]Please don't tell me this is stuck.
[255:26.91]I'm going to try it.
[256:06.75]Why even put that here?
[256:18.21]Oh
[256:42.56]You broke the wood?
[256:50.58]Whatever.
[256:50.92]We're gonna do the same thing.
[256:53.12]The same thing stands.
[256:54.00]Just a little different.
[257:00.79]Get these trees the fuck out of the way.
[257:02.59]First and foremost.
[257:04.95]Get out of here.
[257:07.71]Remove the stumps.
[257:16.68]Push it.
[257:17.06]Push the tree into the ocean, please.
[257:24.39]How did I make this harder?
[257:25.73]How did I make this harder?
[257:27.80]I just made the obstacles harder to get by.
[257:33.88]Watch out for the car.
[257:34.84]Hold on.
[257:46.64]These things are terrible!
[257:55.16]I can't even pick it up!
[258:12.94]Alright, burn!
[258:21.75]Move this fucking thing.
[258:44.77]Wait, I...
[259:07.99]It's not enough!
[259:17.53]Okay, hold on.
[259:56.36]You set the bed Oreo on fire.
[259:58.62]Good, because then it'll burn this whole place down.
[260:07.76]Okay, does it fit?
[260:08.42]Perfect.
[260:11.66]Get this crap out of the way.
[260:15.08]Get this fucking lettuce out of here.
[260:26.04]The alert?
[260:26.80]Oh, shit.
[260:27.50]Yeah.
[260:31.04]Oh, nice toasted Oreo bit.
[260:44.05]It's still spreading.
[260:44.81]Okay.
[261:08.38]He's high for Oreos.
[261:11.12]No, I, you know, I would take something else, though.
[261:15.82]I'd take, like, a large pepperoni pizza right now.
[261:19.38]But my stomach's kind of all fucked up, so I can't really do that.
[261:22.87]So, it's like it's rice and bananas for me.
[261:50.55]Looks like it's good enough.
[261:51.31]Should be fine.
[261:54.91]Let's just make sure I can get through it.
[262:13.05]Good.
[262:13.63]And I can still use this car, but hold on.
[262:16.79]Hold on now.
[262:19.37]Now I gotta do the process of taking this shit down.
[262:25.30]No, just keep it as one piece.
[262:27.26]Throw it in the pool.
[262:31.88]We're turning this way.
[262:39.79]I have to go that way.
[262:42.31]Going off this, pick this up, change cars, and get the fuck out of here.
[262:46.14]Oh yeah.
[262:47.40]It's gonna be sick.
[262:50.68]Load?
[262:54.13]Load?
[262:57.49]What's wrong?
[263:08.99]Something was raising.
[263:09.96]This thing is still raising up and down.
[263:16.68]Yeah, this piece.
[263:17.78]Get this out of here.
[263:18.34]This is going to be a piece of glass.
[263:19.96]I think I bumped into this last time.
[263:38.26]Alright.
[263:42.79]Alright, we're gonna use this car to carve the path for the other car.
[263:45.75]God fucking dammit, dude.
[263:59.72]Just leave it, who cares.
[264:00.82]Yeah, I bumped into something.
[264:23.23]Okay, this looks better.
[264:24.57]This looks better.
[264:25.07]This looks better.
[264:26.39]Get the cement truck.
[264:37.34]Genius.
[264:37.80]Don't crash it.
[264:58.64]Can I dump cement?
[264:59.56]Okay, path carved.
[265:05.09]Here we go.
[265:13.65]Path has been carved.
[265:14.59]Out, grab that.
[265:15.51]Back in here.
[265:16.15]Take this right.
[265:20.18]Carve this out.
[265:24.98]Perfect.
[265:25.20]Perfect.
[265:26.65]Done.
[265:27.67]We get in there, steal the painting that's in here, grab that car, and fuck off to the exit.
[265:32.45]Let's move.
[265:54.66]I'm not going this way.
[265:58.96]Okay, we get in there, jump, jump, go there, forward.
[266:04.70]Perfect right here.
[266:06.80]Something underneath this car.
[266:08.30]There it is.
[266:10.24]And the lettuce.
[266:10.72]Okay, good.
[266:15.66]That's set there.
[266:16.42]This one's set here.
[266:28.81]Okay, there's the movie theater.
[266:36.05]Up.
[266:37.31]Alright, save it, and I'm ready to go.
[266:44.24]I think it's now time to actually complete this mission.
[266:46.70]What do you think?
[266:47.74]What do you say?
[266:51.52]And... Go.
[267:05.61]I should have broke that beforehand.
[267:07.73]Straight through.
[267:37.75]I drove a little too far over the line.
[267:56.35]By the way, why don't I put one of the insane sports cars over here?
[268:10.00]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[268:13.56]Drive?
[268:14.16]What happened?
[268:15.52]What the fuck?
[268:17.58]How did that even happen?
[268:18.74]I don't understand.
[268:20.20]How did that fucking happen?
[268:21.66]How did this happen?
[268:39.55]Come on.
[268:40.18]This is a good plan.
[268:45.84]Holy shit.
[268:50.87]Oh, lost like three seconds so far.
[268:54.73]Did I fall out?
[269:18.95]Whatever.
[269:19.23]Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
[269:31.38]Where am I driving to? Where am I driving to? Where am I driving? Where am I driving to?
[269:41.20]Alright, I get it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[270:21.84]DIE!
[270:42.28]Through the fucking mulch.
[270:44.22]No.
[270:45.04]I can still make it. I can still make it. I can still make it. I can still make it.
[270:59.49]Take the Jeep.
[271:00.81]Alright, I need to get a running start here.
[271:32.46]Take the Jeep.
[271:32.88]Okay, okay, I'm gonna take the Jeep.
[271:47.71]Ah!
[271:47.77]There's no time for the Jeep!
[271:59.80]Forget it!
[272:01.48]Yeah!
[272:05.82]Only four.
[272:06.36]Oh well.
[272:14.97]Getting all of those...
[272:17.61]I wonder what the perfect route is.
[272:19.87]That's hard.
[272:25.08]I guess when you get the actual route down.
[272:29.46]It's probably not really.
[272:35.68]Yeah, how is the Jeep faster than the car?
[272:41.46]Speedrunners ride the planks to go way faster.
[272:53.19]Jeep can drive off-road.
[272:54.44]Is it a perfect run?
[272:57.52]Hold on, let me see.
[272:58.14]Okay, let's watch the perfect run.
[273:05.89]I actually am totally, totally interested to see how this works.
[273:12.55]Oh, shit.
[273:13.09]Alright.
[273:13.93]Hold on.
[273:15.39]Save it here just to make sure I don't crash.
[273:19.56]Watch the perfect run.

[274:03.90]It's Tom Hanks.
[274:04.96]Oh, shit!
[274:06.70]I could have done a Tom Hanks right there.
[274:08.14]Oh, yeah, Tom- Why did I not know it was Tom Hanks?

[274:27.23]So wait, he just like falls out the window.
[274:29.53]Okay, you ready?
[274:36.18]I want to do this again.
[274:41.66]Okay, so he falls off, grabs, falls into the car.
[274:45.32]What?
[274:50.38]Holy shit.
[274:52.27]What the hell was that?
[275:08.53]Alright, that was, hold on, is it, what's wrong with my, is my player fucked up?
[275:11.52]980, dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[275:23.10]Oh.
[275:23.20]That's a great tech, uh, technique, you fall off.
[275:35.25]Blanked, up, what, wait, how are you...
[275:43.46]Oh, he's making holes to take them out.
[275:45.94]What a genius.
[275:50.54]He's moving the- Holy shit!
[275:56.76]What the fuck?
[276:04.03]Why is he spraying?
[276:05.99]Why is he spraying?
[276:13.95]Oh my god.
[276:15.67]He's got all the cars in the perfect place too.
[276:17.69]You gotta be kidding me.
[276:29.54]Dude, this part of... That part right here is unbelievable.
[276:32.38]What does he... How does he even do this?
[276:35.99]He goes up the... Up like a... What?
[276:45.23]That's amazing.
[276:48.21]You spent three hours doing a bit.
[276:51.38]I'm never going to be capable of doing this.
[276:52.94]I don't know why you think I am.
[276:58.80]You think I'm going to be capable of doing that?
[277:00.44]That's never going to happen, man.
[277:02.54]Okay, I am a breaker.
[277:24.44]Everyone stay indoors and away from windows.
[277:30.54]Oh, it's, uh, we have a a, uh, storm outside.
[277:37.38]When you are looking for a bright future, choose Faerans.
[277:50.08]Missing artwork.
[277:52.39]Uh-oh.
[277:57.59]Good evening, I am a claim adjuster at Kurthy Insurance Group investigating an art incident that happened to Gordon Wu recently.
[278:05.09]Mr. Wu claims to know who's responsible for the stolen paintings, a Mr. Lawrence Lee Jr., but he's very keen to not involve the police.
[278:14.33]Gordon's account has caused us some financial strain recently and is in our interest to bring back the paintings as discreetly and swiftly as possible.
[278:23.01]According to our intelligence, the paintings are hidden at the marina.
[278:26.32]I know Gordon's been working with you in the past.
[278:28.60]Maybe you can help out.
[278:29.52]Wait, so I have to bring them back?
[278:38.12]I just got rid of them.
[278:42.09]Okay, shotgun.
[278:42.93]How about... Hmm.
[278:46.61]I feel like I'm not very good with the planks.
[278:52.71]We're going full chaotic evil mode.
[278:55.37]Chaotic neutral.
[278:58.33]This is like lawful good, right?
[279:01.11]This is like chaotic evil.
[279:02.81]This is like chaotic neutral.
[279:04.59]This is like chaotic good.
[279:07.95]This is lawful neutral.
[279:11.00]No, this is probably lawful neutral, lawful evil, and true neutral.
[279:24.68]And none of you liked that at all, huh?
[279:29.28]Okay.
[279:31.98]Alright, let's bring the art back.
[279:36.68]Let's go.
[279:37.14]Lee has hidden four paintings at the marina.
[279:41.38]Help the insurance company retrieve them.
[279:49.34]Stop farming.
[279:50.02]Minus twos.
[279:51.24]What else am I supposed to do?
[279:54.88]Okay.
[279:56.40]I have to get all the art back.
[279:57.96]It's definitely... There's a fire alarm.
[280:00.54]That's it.
[280:00.94]Don't set off the fire alarm.
[280:04.38]Are they not rigged for anything else?
[280:07.18]Let's go look.
[280:12.85]What just happened?
[280:13.45]Lightning?
[280:18.51]Lightning?
[280:23.88]Oh my goodness.
[280:28.22]Uh... Where's the first one?
[280:39.57]Don't set off the fire alarm.
[280:41.51]What if I'm out of... That's out of my control.
[280:43.19]Alright, we got...
[280:49.28]It struck the house!
[280:50.08]Alright, I get it, this- Oh, God.
[280:51.98]Okay, I get it, I get it.
[280:52.82]I understand what it wants me to do.
[280:54.90]Move out of the way, please.
[280:56.28]Move out of the way.
[281:03.12]I get it, I get it.
[281:03.72]You just- Where's the painting?
[281:15.19]Anything, where's the painting?
[281:15.91]Where's the painting?
[281:18.89]Upstairs?
[281:22.83]Do you not have stairs to go into the top floor of your fucking house?
[281:27.58]What?
[281:28.64]Where are the stairs?
[281:43.44]Alright, I got one.
[281:44.83]That wasn't even it.
[281:51.95]Where the fuck is this painting?
[281:55.17]There it is.
[281:55.51]Okay, there it is.
[282:03.77]Secrets up there.
[282:04.31]Hold on.
[282:18.98]I can't do the- I can't.
[282:20.93]I'm about to rip the fucking power cord out of my computer.
[282:23.67]I can't do planks.
[282:38.70]Dude.
[282:39.42]Dude, chill.
[282:52.01]What a pain in the ass.
[282:52.87]How come it blew up the stairs?
[282:54.39]The one place it shouldn't have.
[283:32.85]400!
[283:32.87]400!
[283:34.33]Okay, I got everything I need.
[283:37.07]Let's go.
[283:37.39]No fire in there.
[283:38.41]Alright, move on to the next building, which is... Up here.
[283:46.64]That was worth it.
[283:47.22]Yeah, it was.
[283:54.73]Really?
[283:54.87]Really?
[284:03.15]No fire.
[284:03.70]Fire alert.
[284:08.98]Well, it's buried under a bunch of rubble.
[284:10.42]I can't get under there.
[284:22.65]Destroy the stairs again.
[284:33.16]Fuck.
[284:34.54]What the heck?
[284:43.40]Alright, where's this one?
[284:45.22]In the back.
[284:47.91]Ooh, okay.
[284:56.59]No!
[284:58.99]Nooo!
[285:09.46]Shit, this whole place is burning down.
[285:11.82]Any secrets up here?
[285:12.70]I don't see any money or anything.
[285:15.50]Okay, no.
[285:25.45]Alright, fire's out.
[285:27.91]Anything to steal?
[285:31.61]Not really.
[285:31.97]Alright, now we need that painting.
[285:35.30]Painting's up in the top left.
[285:56.66]Alright, now just ride on it.
[285:57.60]Like Timmy's room.
[286:13.35]Is it on the outside of the house?
[286:15.65]Bizarre place to put that.
[286:16.81]Okay.
[286:18.48]Now I'm going to take a boat.
[286:19.40]We're going to go across.
[286:34.20]Lightning strike.
[286:35.26]Oh no.
[286:40.04]Oh no.
[286:40.45]Oh no.
[286:40.77]Oh no.
[286:41.07]Oh no.
[286:41.35]I got it.
[286:41.67]I got it.
[286:41.89]I'm on it.
[286:42.17]I'm on it.
[286:42.47]I'm on it.
[286:42.73]I'm on it.
[286:44.11]I'm on it.
[286:44.43]I'm on it.
[286:47.51]Oh fuck.
[286:47.97]I gotta get up.
[287:04.16]Hey, so wouldn't the rain be helping?
[287:06.96]You would assume, right?
[287:10.28]Alright, that's taken care of.
[287:11.10]Is there one in here?
[287:15.30]Shit!
[287:15.74]There's one- This one all the way down.
[287:23.03]How is this- Wouldn't I just end this one?
[287:26.73]How is this attached?
[287:59.27]Ow.
[288:01.11]What am I doing?
[288:01.79]I just, I don't know.
[288:03.65]I'm going back to do this last one so I don't have to wrap around.
[288:10.36]No, I'm not high.
[288:11.28]I'm not high every day, guys.
[288:12.86]There's no fires anywhere.
[288:24.08]I'm fine.
[288:36.31]I got it.
[288:48.67]Where's this other fire?
[288:49.50]No, it's on another house.
[288:58.10]I gotta get up there now.
[288:59.38]Up, up, up.
[288:59.76]Come on, come on, come on.
[289:00.48]Up, up, up, up, up.
[289:10.57]Knock all the houses into the water.
[289:12.15]You're a mean person.
[289:14.63]You're a mean person.
[289:26.32]Alright, now where?
[289:36.79]What's next?
[289:39.79]Only got one more.
[289:41.03]Just the warehouse.
[289:55.18]The boat is sinking.
[289:56.34]It's fine.
[289:57.16]I just had to get it over here so I can go over here.
[290:01.26]Okay.
[290:04.44]Next step.
[290:05.06]Warehouse.
[290:06.26]There's no sound?
[290:07.12]Yes, there is.
[290:10.19]You guys don't hear any sound?
[290:14.21]Oh, when we watched the video, the sound was really loud, so I had to turn it down.
[290:18.39]I thought you guys were just fucking with me.
[290:20.65]Alright, give me a car.
[290:48.44]This is slow as hell.
[290:49.54]This thing sucks.
[290:53.80]No fire?
[290:55.10]I can walk faster.
[290:59.80]How did I miss?
[291:01.52]How did I miss?
[291:02.32]That's not even possible to miss.
[291:04.28]Sorry I pressed tab during like an exciting moment.
[291:24.96]Okay.
[291:25.34]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[291:26.86]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[291:29.24]Where's the painting?
[291:30.14]It's up there.
[291:30.56]Alright.
[291:30.84]Fire alert.
[291:31.44]Fire.
[291:31.70]There's a fire.
[291:33.32]Fire alert.
[291:35.68]Alert.
[291:35.90]There's a fire.
[291:36.44]I got to get in.
[291:39.18]Get in.
[291:39.70]Get in.
[291:40.14]Get in.
[291:40.44]Get in.
[291:40.70]Get in.
[291:40.98]Get in.
[291:41.34]The place burns down.
[291:43.52]Ow.
[291:44.80]No.
[291:45.08]No.
[291:45.20]There's a fire in here.
[291:46.06]Okay.
[291:46.70]Quiet.
[291:47.02]I got to do these planks.
[291:49.72]Oh, my God.
[291:50.22]Do it right here.
[292:03.43]No!
[292:04.66]Fuck!
[292:08.86]I just gotta give her the painting and get the fuck out of here!
[292:11.68]Give her the painting and get out!
[292:12.56]Give her the painting!
[292:15.90]Where's this fucking painting?
[292:23.90]Fuck, I just reload!
[292:25.61]Oh, I'm so pissed.
[292:27.97]I'm so mad.
[292:29.31]Somebody just dipped me into acid.
[292:31.81]I just got dipped into like a hot fucking... Ah, this is so far away.
[292:38.97]I gotta bind save to left mouse button.
[292:50.30]I'm doing that one last.
[293:05.51]Like, I'm not even there yet.
[293:07.43]Like, why would you put it that crazy?
[293:09.17]I'm not even there.
[293:10.65]I'm not even here.
[293:18.43]I'm not even here.
[293:19.27]Dude, how does one get rid of this fire this quickly?
[293:32.57]How does one do that?
[293:41.85]Where- um, where's the- Excuse me, where's the- where's the fire?
[293:47.43]You see a fire?
[294:18.47]It's because I fucking skipped it.
[294:21.85]You asshole.
[294:31.90]Um, I have a solution.
[294:35.18]Just throw them in the water.
[294:55.89]I just don't feel like detaching that.
[295:13.95]I could have just opened the front door.
[295:32.23]Where is it?
[295:33.05]It's the last piece.
[295:38.05]Alright.
[295:38.45]Yes!
[295:43.36]Last one.
[295:45.08]That last one, I gotta go all the way down here.
[295:48.62]Save this shit.
[295:51.24]What about goodies?
[295:52.44]They could be goodies.
[295:55.29]I'm gonna leave without at least one or two goodies.
[295:56.99]In the attic.
[296:08.81]Yep.
[296:09.15]240 bucks.
[296:10.89]Antique fucking coins.
[296:20.06]Uh... What was I... What am I doing?
[296:23.52]Why did I just do that?
[296:24.22]Okay.
[296:30.41]We're ready to drive.
[296:32.33]This car can't drive.
[296:34.57]Oh, I'm just taking the boat around the whole damn place.
[296:36.07]I don't care.
[296:44.93]What are your thoughts on collabing with Gar- I don't know who that is.
[296:49.09]Is that place on fire?
[296:54.69]The building's on fire, isn't it?
[297:00.74]Fuck, just don't.
[297:04.08]Who cares?
[297:05.22]I should have been paying attention to the road that's made out of liquid.
[297:08.86]Why did I do that?
[297:17.98]You just ignored a raid?
[297:19.13]I got raided?
[297:20.21]Oh shit, did I get a raid?
[297:21.19]Who raided?
[297:21.49]Did I get a raid?
[297:28.33]Who came in?
[297:28.73]I need to get up on top.
[297:48.86]Oh my fucking god, please.
[297:50.34]Don't do this to me.
[297:52.52]There's the rest of it.
[297:56.74]Oh shit.
[297:57.80]This is where planks have to make some sense.
[298:15.17]Stop spreading!
[298:18.19]Stop spreading, please!
[298:21.00]Why is it spreading so much?
[298:24.11]I just told it not to do that.
[298:50.37]Sorry, to put the house fire out, I had to shoot it.
[298:52.94]It's out.
[299:05.39]We're good.
[299:06.68]Save the game.
[299:45.06]It's okay.
[299:45.42]It's just this bottom row of teeth.
[299:58.09]Alright.
[299:58.35]Sayonara!
[300:08.03]Fog.
[300:16.14]That one was fun.
[300:17.20]I like that one.
[300:20.22]I like the idea of needing to use your tools.
[300:24.27]Besides just, you know, steal something that's attached to an alarm.
[300:28.25]A new tool, by the way.
[300:30.35]Which those are fun too, though.
[300:32.45]What's the new tool?
[300:38.04]Another gun?
[300:43.02]Why would I care about gun when I have shotgun?
[300:45.32]Gun.
[300:56.16]It's more accurate?
[300:58.16]Hmm.
[301:04.30]What should I do?
[301:11.36]Range?
[301:17.99]Yeah.
[301:18.61]Shotgun.
[301:18.93]I like the shotgun.
[301:20.17]Let's max this out.
[301:23.41]Oh, TV.
[301:23.69]TV.
[301:27.75]I did this.
[301:28.17]No more TV.
[301:43.92]It's time for you to go to bed.
[301:44.86]This sounds horrible.
[301:56.36]Don't you feel like this is gonna just pop?
[301:58.06]It sounds horrible.
[302:09.71]This is like a bee's nest.
[302:24.78]It's growing.
[302:37.71]That was a Silent Hill enemy.
[302:39.99]I killed it, don't worry.
[302:40.65]Hey, nice job with the paintings.
[302:47.25]A little charred here and there, so I'll have to find someone to retouch them a bit before they return to Gordon.
[302:51.62]He won't know the difference.
[302:55.70]Now Gordon has an insurance problem.
[302:59.30]Not only did Lee steal some of our most beloved paintings, but the insurance company is causing me headaches too.
[303:05.42]I'm a premium customer.
[303:07.32]I still haven't seen any money for those paintings.
[303:10.00]I'll deal with Lee later.
[303:11.66]But right now I need to take that insurance payout in my own hands.
[303:14.16]I don't have a personal grudge with anyone at the company, so I'd like to just poke them a bit where it hurts.
[303:19.64]Any respected company the most, their bank account.
[303:22.31]I have a top-notch policy on my cars, so if some of those were to be stolen...
[303:27.42]They need to cough it up.
[303:29.80]I'll hook up a few cars to the alarm system to make it look legit.
[303:32.32]Please be gentle.
[303:36.48]Help Gordon steal at least three of his own cars to help him with the insurance payout.
[303:40.16]I feel like we just did this one.
[303:47.82]We did it for the other guy.
[303:48.64]But it's in the daytime this time.
[303:53.23]I steal three cars.
[304:03.62]Steal, not drown.
[304:05.22]Oh.
[304:05.38]Go to the go-kart track?
[304:21.94]Well, in a minute.
[304:24.22]This car has some pep to it.
[304:38.96]Nice.
[304:46.95]Ooh.
[304:51.15]Welcome to Mario Kart.
[304:55.27]That was super low effort and very low energy.
[304:57.72]I could have done, Welcome to Mario Kart.
[305:02.68]Select your player.
[305:03.94]Okay.
[305:16.79]60 seconds.
[305:28.51]How the fuck do you do this one?
[305:29.77]Is it already on fire?
[305:30.77]Restart this.
[305:42.48]Can I drop?
[305:43.96]No, I can't drive this around.
[305:45.28]Sorry.
[305:45.63]So how am I supposed to?
[305:46.61]I'm supposed to do this.
[305:53.71]This is wired.
[305:57.01]This is wired.
[306:01.83]They're all wired, so I have to drive them back here and then
[306:10.35]Is there any other cars that are on the map?
[306:12.33]I guess I could leave them around.
[306:20.31]Take a look.
[306:24.20]I could play- okay.
[306:26.54]I guess the idea is this.
[306:29.16]I just have a bunch of spare cars here.
[306:34.14]You know what I mean?
[306:34.80]So I drive that one up here.

[314:38.77]Okay, well now that I know that, I gotta be careful.
[314:46.02]It's rigged to explode.
[314:47.46]No, fucking idiots, don't!

[318:23.33]Minimum.
[318:24.55]Minimum.
[318:25.83]Minimum.
[318:27.18]That's from a video from like 2012, by the way.
[318:31.94]On Star's channel.
[318:32.72]We played a game called Minimum.
[318:34.98]And, I don't know, we just played new games sometimes.
[318:53.60]Alright, that just looks fun.
[318:54.86]Alright, let's take, let's pick up the whole thing.
[319:19.86]This is attached to... I have to attach that to something.
[319:23.43]To a crane.
[319:23.91]First time I've used a crane the whole game.
[319:44.99]Almost happened.
[319:45.59]Almost.
[319:45.81]Almost.
[319:47.93]You were close to being able to ride Omega Lull.
[319:50.90]Almost.
[319:51.84]It's close.
[320:08.03]How am I going to do this?
[320:43.24]How do I extend the crane?
[320:48.56]I never did this before.
[320:54.21]Arm.
[320:54.71]Hook.
[320:56.45]Hook.
[320:57.77]Arm.
[321:13.26]Shit.
[321:13.50]Is that gonna work?
[321:28.42]What's going on?
[321:29.62]What is going on?
[321:43.00]Kanye in chat.

[321:55.81]Slow down.
[321:57.01]I need to make some... Hold on.
[322:13.45]Um, okay, the device, this is the device, but this can't fall off.
[322:22.47]How do I get this off without doing that?
[322:23.61]Herman Supreme is in chat.
[322:29.23]You know, I probably would be, like, more excited about that.
[322:34.41]This guy wears the boot on his head and always runs for president in, like, New Hampshire, right?
[322:41.12]Okay, we're gonna pull this.
[322:42.00]Uh... You know, it's just like, fuck it.
[322:45.65]Let's just pull it off and see what happens.
[322:55.53]Good.
[323:03.15]Okay.
[323:03.29]Okay.
[323:13.08]Easy.
[323:13.20]Which way do I go?

[323:21.80]What?
[323:22.04]Oof, why'd I fall over?
[323:25.64]What the fuck?
[323:37.45]There are no raids right now.
[323:44.42]I want to go on this road.
[323:45.94]It's the safest road.
[323:46.80]I'll win.
[324:08.31]Raid!

[324:23.45]Come on down here!
[324:29.80]Get down here!
[324:44.12]I don't think I can even do this.
[324:56.97]How did I fuck this up?
[325:01.88]Don't hook the plank.
[325:04.76]Oh wait, I can get rid of this shit now.
[325:06.54]I don't even need this anymore.
[325:12.75]What the fuck am I doing?
[325:26.70]Perfect!
[325:35.38]That's better.
[325:36.07]Alright, let's go.
[325:56.87]Hook both of them?
[326:01.09]Can I hook both ends?
[326:05.52]Can I even do that?
[326:10.76]I don't think I can do that.
[326:22.66]You mean like that?
[326:29.85]Alright, that worked.
[326:32.04]Yeah, that worked.
[326:53.20]Slow down.

[332:42.46]I'm always talking about bananas.
[332:43.42]I'm always showing bananas.
[332:44.56]I did a banana costume last year.
[332:46.68]That's unbelievable.
[332:50.59]We talk about banana splits.
[332:54.25]Every time there's a new sub, I peel a banana and I fucking go, banana bros.
[333:00.81]That's crazy that you put that in.
[333:02.85]Thanks, dude.

[333:50.82]And hey, I see that you're not subbed.
[333:55.87]I mean, we got to get you in the banana, bros.
[334:07.83]It's me, the dev.
[334:09.63]What an elaborate thing that that person just did to tell me to go into the furnace to get $600 for a hidden, like, money.
[334:17.89]You could have just said, hey, dude, look, check under the furnace, there's money.
[334:22.06]There's a banana for money.
[334:22.74]No, pretend Easter egg.
[334:28.56]Me.
[334:30.74]Playing to my ego.
[334:41.19]Alright, we've got two more.
[334:43.31]Guess what?
[334:43.59]I managed to decrypt the GPS locations and it pointed me to Hollow Rock Island.
[334:47.95]An old fish processing plant now making some kind of energy drink.
[334:51.97]BT is short for Blue Tide.
[334:54.99]Why didn't I think of that before?
[334:55.95]My daughter's totally addicted to that disgusting, sugary sludge.
[335:03.45]I'm drinking water, by the way.
[335:04.45]I'm here right now.
[335:05.13]It's a bit worn down, but pretty.
[335:07.92]I need to find out where the Lee payments go.
[335:10.44]Have a look at the blue tide computers.
[335:13.32]Or this one.
[335:16.22]I just got this awesome idea for humiliating Gordon.
[335:18.08]You know that ridiculous undersized racetrack he keeps in his backyard to pretend to be a race driver?
[335:23.75]Wouldn't it be funny if he came home to a new track record on that display?
[335:26.87]You're a decent driver.
[335:29.05]By the way, those paintings you helped me with earlier, they didn't make it through the thunderstorm.
[335:32.75]Burned up every single one.
[335:33.65]What are the odds?
[335:36.71]I gotta do the racetrack?
[335:39.52]Help Lee annoy Gordon by beating the track record on his private racetrack.
[335:42.90]Oh, let's do this one.
[335:55.05]We just got a new sub?
[335:56.59]Oh, potassium power!
[336:01.49]Can I see some potassium power emotes in the chat, please, guys?
[336:05.79]Power!
[336:06.39]Power!
[336:08.91]I love that word.
[336:09.49]Finish lap in 25 seconds.
[336:19.24]Finish lap in 20 seconds.
[336:21.02]I get to choose what car I can use.
[336:24.04]Total corruption.
[336:30.19]Total power.
[336:33.67]Total corruption.
[336:38.05]Sing the banana song.
[336:40.27]Yummy, delicious banana.
[336:42.02]I can't wait to eat.
[336:43.46]Okay.
[336:44.00]Where do I find a car?
[336:46.70]I just love delicious banana.
[336:48.55]Did I do it with like the Winnebago?
[336:56.37]What a dogshit stream that would be, seriously.
[336:58.10]Like, if I did that, if that was my thing, we were like the banana bros?
[337:03.42]Wow, for what?
[337:04.42]That's what my entire channel identity is around, like, I like bananas?
[337:08.17]What a stupid, like, persona that would be.
[337:13.69]We got a new sub!
[337:14.59]I love to eat bananas!
[337:16.73]What the fuck are you talking about?
[337:24.31]Like a banana?

[338:26.66]What if I just cheat?

[339:58.84]I should have saved it.
[340:00.62]Why did I not save it?
[340:04.75]I should have saved it.
[340:06.59]Why did I not save it?
[340:10.13]Why did I not save it?
[340:12.49]Is there a reason we need to attack this coronavirus head on?
[340:19.26]How do I...
[340:26.00]Ernie?
[340:27.82]That's Boris Johnson, dude.
[340:29.64]What are you talking about?

[340:47.65]Ernie, I'm gone.
[340:49.37]Oh, I didn't get to do the funny thing.
[340:56.14]Where the... Where's the cool car?
[340:59.84]I'm lost.
[341:00.30]Oh, it's over there.
[341:17.50]Remember, just clear a path so you can cheat.
[341:19.36]No, I want to do it for real.
[341:21.34]You know why I want to do it for real?
[341:23.47]Because the last time I had to do a race, I just made it easy.
[341:29.88]I didn't do it.
[341:30.36]I chickened out and I skipped it.
[341:33.18]I'm not skipping it this time.
[341:46.75]Here we go.
[341:49.40]How far away can I be?
[341:52.96]Okay, get ready.
[341:57.53]Damn it, it knows if you cheat.
[342:15.85]Let's go!
[342:16.67]Boo!
[342:44.09]Game sucks.
[342:45.01]Game sucks.
[342:45.97]Game's not good.
[342:54.88]Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready.
[342:59.62]Yup!
[343:02.68]Did I forget to turn the car?
[343:04.88]I was so happy about doing that.
[343:13.19]I've been a viewer for over six years, but I've always wondered, what is that liquid you inject yourself in the pre-stream video?
[343:20.78]As a diabetic myself, I can really relate to having to inject insulin.
[343:24.60]What?
[343:28.68]What are you talking about?
[343:37.61]That was a mega drift.
[343:39.35]Too much drift.
[343:42.51]Too much drift.
[343:46.65]Missed the punchline.
[343:48.89]I've never seen insulin that was disgustingly brown like that.
[343:52.19]Thanks for the laughs.
[343:52.95]I don't get it.
[343:55.41]I don't inject anything into my body on stream.
[343:57.83]What?
[343:58.67]Wait, here it comes.
[344:00.23]Eric, is this Tom?
[344:01.11]No, I thought that... No, it was on the way.
[344:38.52]Stop Dr- I'm not drifting.
[344:40.24]It's just the game is hard to control.
[344:45.87]I'm not- I'm not drifting.
[344:46.81]The car is just incredibly fast and it's a slick track.
[345:02.60]It's slick!
[345:11.29]I was here.
[345:11.69]I was here!
[345:12.37]Fuck, I didn't do it.
[345:33.61]Get back on the track!
[345:45.39]Oh, there's too much drift!
[345:48.84]Don't spin out.
[345:52.30]Don't!
[345:53.90]That person is gone.
[346:08.09]That drift was perfect.
[346:09.33]Yeah, but look, it's hard.
[346:25.67]Use a controller?
[346:27.37]No, I'm a PC gamer.
[346:32.33]Fuck, come on.
[346:45.36]Come on.
[347:02.34]Holy shit, that's a lot of community subs.
[347:08.14]Shady Seas, thanks for the 20 subs.
[347:10.67]Actually, actually a shitload of subs.
[347:22.65]Thanks for the 20 subs.
[347:26.24]Thanks for the 20 delicious bananas.
[347:34.26]Not bad.
[347:58.81]I was here.
[347:59.39]I was here.
[347:59.89]I was here.
[348:00.41]I was here.
[348:24.14]Wait, there might be stuff in here.
[348:30.78]Yup.
[348:31.70]Free shit.
[348:32.46]I have 900 bucks.
[348:35.25]I'm going to buy something after this.
[348:38.21]On more.
[348:38.53]Whatever that was.
[348:58.22]It sounded like a tool shed coming down the stairs.
[349:21.86]Finish the job.
[349:30.08]This isn't a pasta.
[349:32.70]Jerma, who are you talking to?
[349:33.54]It's been 12 years since the accident and you haven't been taking your medication for a few months.
[349:37.63]Okay, thanks.
[349:39.89]Five month subscriber.
[349:40.73]Jerma, who are you talking to?
[349:41.59]Money.
[349:44.81]Lots of it.
[349:50.41]Oh, I missed a shitload of stuff.
[349:51.59]What the hell am I doing?
[349:52.41]Hey, Zurich.
[349:53.85]Zurich, duh.
[349:54.63]Thanks for the $50.
[349:54.99]5,000 bits from Zurich.
[349:59.71]They say Banana Bros.
[350:00.83]Thanks, man.
[350:01.91]Appreciate it.
[350:02.49]Welcome to the Banana Bros.
[350:08.11]That's 5,000 bits.
[350:09.22]That's a shitload of money.
[350:10.06]Thank you.
[350:11.92]We had Shady Seas gave 20 community subs.
[350:13.54]They also gave 100 bucks.
[350:15.12]I missed that a long time ago.
[350:16.69]This was like three hours ago.
[350:19.29]Uh, Shady Seas, 10,000 bits.
[350:23.11]They say, hope you're doing well, Jerma.
[350:24.09]I just got back from the hospital for an infection in my seesome that they haven't seemed to figure out what's causing it.
[350:29.95]This is the second time I've ended up hospitalized for it.
[350:32.79]It's frustrating.
[350:34.19]Streams like yours that help getting the recovery easier.
[350:38.63]What's, uh, the seesome?
[350:40.81]The...
[350:43.21]It's a seesaw.
[350:43.77]Where's that?
[350:48.79]Is it in your stomach?
[350:53.78]Connects to the appendix.
[350:55.70]Oh, shit.
[350:58.95]Well, hopefully you feel better.
[351:02.44]Second time you've been hospitalized for it.
[351:04.44]Hopefully you don't have to do that again.
[351:05.80]As someone that has medical problems that are sort of... Just don't go away and kind of come out of nowhere.
[351:12.58]I can understand where you're coming from.
[351:17.07]But I wish you a complete and swift recovery.
[351:20.79]Medical problems suck.
[351:25.09]Oh, there was a raid too.
[351:30.25]It was a raid from Charborg.
[351:32.51]Thank you, Charborg.
[351:33.23]If any of the Charborgs are still here.

[351:44.58]And InkCat gave five community subs.
[351:48.68]Thanks, guys.

[353:32.56]I need that computer.
[353:38.07]Oh, thank god it's still standing.

[354:03.77]Max out the shotgun?
[354:07.23]Yeah.
[354:07.73]Let's do max shotgun.
[354:10.93]That's good.
[354:17.88]What's next?
[354:22.75]This is still going.
[354:26.67]I'm right here.
[354:27.37]It's a bit worn down.
[354:28.15]Alright, we gotta, yeah.
[354:28.77]This is what we have to do.
[354:29.45]We have to decrypt the GPS.
[354:32.09]Blue Tide Computers.
[354:32.83]This is a new place.
[354:33.43]This is a new place!
[354:36.67]Steal computers for Parisa to investigate Lee's payments.
[354:39.53]This is a new area.
[354:45.91]Blue Tide Computers.
[354:51.60]I gotta be honest.
[354:54.81]This game's early access.
[354:57.17]I did not expect it to be like a six plus potential hour campaign here.
[355:05.76]And there's a sandbox mode and there's a create level mode.
[355:08.58]I mean, if there's ever an early access game that I would say this deserves to be supported, it's definitely this one.
[355:24.20]I'm shocked that there's a full six plus hour campaign.
[355:27.68]And it's not done, apparently.
[355:32.01]Better than Watch Dogs?
[355:32.83]Yes, it is.
[355:33.83]This is a better game than Watch Dogs.
[355:35.81]I will say that a thousand times.
[355:38.09]Alright, what's our objective?
[355:41.79]A lot, actually.
[355:44.62]Okay, we need to steal this.
[355:48.32]Let's go take a look.
[355:54.54]That just repeats whatever words Jerma says.
[355:58.12]This is the best stream on Twitch.
[356:10.51]Oh, don't say true.
[356:11.15]You're supposed to say the thing I just said.
[356:13.70]This is the worst stream on Twitch.
[356:19.56]This one looks elaborate.
[356:22.46]Very elaborate, actually.
[356:23.64]Alright, we gotta go that way.
[356:33.92]It was the best of streams.
[356:34.86]It was the worst of streams.
[356:35.92]Is that, um... Charles Dickens?
[356:40.82]Who is that?
[356:53.37]Can't break that?
[356:54.31]Yes, I can.
[356:54.89]Excuse me?
[357:00.44]That can't be broken?
[357:05.62]What is it?
[357:06.04]Veggie tails?
[357:15.18]Yeah, veggie tails.
[357:16.58]It was the best of times.
[357:17.66]It was the worst of times.
[357:19.04]Not veggie tails.
[357:21.34]No secrets.
[357:21.88]This is stupid.
[357:27.28]What?
[357:28.54]Nothing in the fridge either.
[357:29.44]Why even do that?
[357:39.07]Why open them when you can just smash them?
[357:45.06]Hmm.
[357:46.48]Nothing.
[357:50.23]I mean, it's fun to just break stuff.
[357:52.23]That's the only reason why I'm doing this.
[357:55.27]Just fucking throw this thing out the window.
[357:56.71]Who gives a shit?
[358:04.53]The stream's wild.
[358:05.51]I'm too high for this.
[358:06.89]Well, don't take as much.
[358:07.83]What are you doing?
[358:08.67]What are you talking about?
[358:13.10]Whoa.
[358:16.28]What is this bank vault down here?
[358:19.84]It's a literal bank vault.
[358:34.99]Shit.
[358:35.27]Okay, can I... Wait, I can cut through this.
[358:39.67]We're getting in this.
[358:41.53]Oh my god, this is a lot of money.
[358:46.69]I can't get in there.
[358:51.78]Are you serious?
[359:07.71]Don't burn the place down.
[359:14.17]Can I go through the ceiling?
[359:17.72]Dig?
[359:22.13]I don't think I can dig underneath that.
[359:23.63]Hold on.
[359:29.41]Keep that in a... Keep that over here.
[359:30.65]Wait a minute.
[359:31.67]Through the ceiling.
[359:37.89]Shit, how do I get in here?
[359:55.01]Where'd that go?
[360:07.14]Shit.
[360:09.86]I will torch this whole place.
[360:15.68]I gotta find a way in there.
[360:16.60]Alright, what do we got?
[360:31.95]This has got to be like a side entrance, right?
[360:34.58]Or like a little thing to go in.
[360:35.66]Alright, here we go.
[360:39.82]Look.
[360:40.46]This is great.
[360:42.48]This is great.
[360:56.29]Damn it.
[361:14.39]Maybe I can crash into it.
[361:17.72]You think I can just drive into it?
[361:28.93]There is gold down there.
[361:32.65]It's glowing and it's gold.
[361:36.97]That's like five grand.
[361:49.07]Side of the house.
[361:50.56]What about the side of the house?
[361:51.86]I'm going to try the side of the house.
[361:54.54]Give me.
[362:29.04]Oh, shit.
[362:30.26]Oh, shit!
[362:34.42]I found it.
[362:34.72]I just found it.
[362:36.38]I found it.
[362:37.17]I found it.
[362:37.69]I found it!
[362:41.85]I found it!
[362:51.21]Wait, this is even better.
[362:52.68]It's like a gold mine.
[362:56.50]Wait, where's the house?
[363:13.04]Where's the house?
[363:24.56]Is it?
[363:26.88]I think I found it.
[363:32.74]Let me out of here.
[363:39.51]No, it's not.
[363:43.25]Wait, what did I just find?
[363:47.17]No, this is not even right.
[363:52.28]Get me back over there.
[363:57.42]Wait, this is... How did I end up over here?
[364:15.81]Where the fuck am I?
[364:17.37]I don't even remember where I was.
[364:18.57]I just- I'm hitting things with the hammer.
[364:28.50]That's all I know.
[364:30.00]I don't know anything else.
[364:35.18]I gotta go down there.
[364:36.28]There's a whole underground facility.
[364:39.88]I gotta-
[364:47.42]What is this junk?
[364:48.96]What is this junk?
[364:49.76]Here's computer number one.
[365:12.08]Alright, not ready for that yet.
[365:14.78]I swear to God, I don't even know what house I was in.
[365:19.82]I have no idea.
[365:21.54]What house was I in?
[365:24.29]Here?
[365:24.51]I was inside of this, right?
[365:30.29]How did I end up all the way down here?
[365:31.47]No.
[365:39.82]No.
[365:44.81]Where the fuck did I go?
[365:46.13]This place is so vast and expansive.
[365:48.09]I don't even know where I am.
[365:48.99]Oh, I've been here.
[365:51.00]Okay.
[365:51.52]There's damage.
[365:51.94]I've been here.
[365:53.72]This is it.
[365:54.12]Okay, okay, okay.
[365:54.54]This is it.
[365:54.96]I found it.
[365:55.22]I got it.
[365:55.50]Another computer.
[366:09.37]Okay, computer two.
[366:21.26]Okay, nothing.
[366:30.35]Secret!
[366:31.27]Is there a secret in the wall or something?
[366:34.98]What's this?
[366:36.44]Oh!
[366:36.92]Binoculars.
[366:49.81]What's this?
[366:51.29]See, there's gotta be something in the desk.
[366:53.29]First of all.
[366:53.73]There's nothing in his desk?
[367:06.74]Where the fuck do I get over there?
[367:16.95]This can't be the end here.
[367:25.38]There's a button.
[367:25.72]Do I have to press this button?
[367:27.23]Oh no, it's a light.
[367:40.87]Really?
[367:41.17]Go this way.
[367:57.12]Fucking asshole.
[368:04.55]I don't even see a way to get in here.
[368:13.41]There's a grate there.
[368:25.10]There's a grate there.
[368:27.98]On the other side there.
[368:29.11]Okay, wait.
[368:30.83]Let's see what that is.
[368:38.33]What's that?
[369:02.24]It's down here.
[369:03.39]Where is it?
[369:06.07]Where is it?
[369:08.65]There's a little, okay, right here, there's like a vent.
[369:11.37]Oh, that's a welcome mat.
[369:21.75]Oh, shit.
[369:23.31]Found it.
[369:25.00]Goodbye.
[369:30.66]No, that was a vacuum cleaner.
[369:32.00]A secret vacuum cleaner?
[369:33.04]Oh, no, this is just a closet.
[369:47.33]This has to be it.
[369:51.27]Okay, hold on.
[370:03.99]But how do I-
[370:41.51]Uh, is it?
[370:43.03]No.
[370:47.21]Shit!
[370:48.09]Is it over here?
[370:52.14]Fuck!
[370:52.58]No, this is just a little... Don't ever come near me again!
[370:58.06]Just throw some Chef Boy ID down here!
[371:01.72]I don't understand.
[371:23.82]No, I can't.
[371:24.49]You don't swim?
[371:25.21]Did I find it?
[371:40.93]I think it's connected to something over here.
[371:44.39]What is this?
[371:46.24]I think this is it.
[371:47.10]Okay, I found it.
[371:47.56]Because then there's... Um... Where the fuck am I?
[372:04.53]You're gonna plank my way out of here?
[372:05.77]I only have 10 planks left.
[372:07.50]I don't think I can do this in 10 planks.
[372:09.04]I need like 30.
[372:18.80]Wait, what's up there?
[372:33.23]What is up there?
[372:37.73]What the fuck happened?
[372:38.61]Am I inside of the Earth?
[372:51.62]I went underneath the game world.
[372:53.40]Is that what really happened?
[372:55.49]Well, I gotta find my way back up.
[372:56.79]That's a weird sound.
[373:07.00]Water?
[373:21.38]Wait, I see a blinking light.
[373:22.76]Something's blinking over here.
[373:25.08]I think I'm in trouble.
[373:49.11]This is water.
[374:36.84]I made it!
[374:42.17]Alright, now how do I get in the vent?
[374:43.35]Okay.
[374:48.75]Vent is right there.
[374:52.64]See that?
[374:55.28]Therefore, we're gonna go just straight this way.
[375:08.47]It's right there.
[375:13.66]It's... Okay, I gotta keep my... It's literally right here.
[375:29.36]It's like right here.

[379:08.37]I don't get it.
[379:57.96]I need to get up here somehow.
[379:59.50]I'm just gonna stack boxes.
[380:01.13]See if that works.
[380:21.73]No, that's not how you do it.
[380:23.13]I don't know.
[380:23.43]I don't understand.
[380:23.95]I don't...

[380:52.86]How am I going to do that?
[380:54.90]No, turn off emote only and I want somebody to tell me what to do.
[381:05.03]Don't tell me what to do.
[381:11.89]I'm turning it off.

[384:24.49]But I don't care!
[384:25.33]I'm... Which way do I go?
[384:28.80]That's the wrong vent.
[384:29.72]I don't see any... I need to find a vent.
[384:43.14]Vent!
[384:51.97]That's the right vent.
[384:53.10]You had it.
[384:53.96]It was the right vent.
[384:54.74]That's the right vent.
[384:55.46]What?
[384:57.20]You literally won't fit in that vent.
[385:01.08]No, it's not the right vent.
[385:13.75]Fuck the one guy.
[385:15.25]That's like a thousand guys.
[385:16.33]Vent?

[388:34.21]I'm so in!
[388:40.75]Shit, that's it.
[388:41.44]I'm almost there.
[388:42.56]I'm almost there.
[388:43.38]I'm almost there.
[388:44.04]Oh my god.
[388:46.30]Oh my god.
[388:47.20]Okay, slow down.
[388:48.38]Don't do anything crazy.
[388:50.00]Okay.

[388:54.93]Don't do anything insane that I wouldn't do.
[388:56.91]Give me a...
[389:01.66]I stuffed myself in!
[389:03.65]Oh shit!

[389:36.15]I can't walk forward.
[389:36.97]I can't walk forward.
[389:52.62]Hey, where's the gold?
[389:59.67]Twenty-five hundred dollars!
[390:05.60]Always believe in yourself.
[390:11.26]Twenty-five hundred bucks.
[390:22.66]Save.
[390:24.48]Okay, now how do I open the door?
[390:35.34]You just don't.
[390:36.26]Okay.
[390:40.54]Just vent.
[390:44.14]Right.
[390:44.36]Yeah, I could vent.
[390:49.09]Put a hole in the wall?
[390:51.55]Cracked wall?
[390:52.13]What?
[390:52.89]What do you mean it's a cracked wall?
[390:57.33]That was the wrong button.
[390:59.91]I thought it was a flank.
[391:01.93]You know what?
[391:02.47]I don't fucking care.
[391:03.29]I'm just gonna go.
[391:07.11]Load the game, right.
[391:09.76]There's a cracked wall?
[391:10.80]I didn't even see it.
[391:16.40]There is a cracked wall.
[391:19.59]Mmm, intriguing.
[391:21.73]Intriguing!
[391:29.99]That's nothing.
[391:40.01]I'm done.
[391:43.34]I have it saved right there.
[391:44.24]I'm done.
[391:47.98]I had to get the $2,500.
[391:48.88]I had to!
[391:56.45]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[391:59.33]Tomorrow we're going to do... Oh, that's a good question.
[392:00.95]I don't know.
[392:03.37]I'm sure we'll figure it out.
[392:08.44]Quickload?
[392:09.06]Yeah, I will.
[392:14.57]Yeah, I'm good.
[392:19.37]I am actually surprised.
[392:20.79]Is this a sandbox as a creator?
[392:22.23]There's more to do.
[392:24.87]Coin game?
[392:25.95]Oh, wait a minute.
[392:28.13]Did coin game actually come out with the new arcade?
[392:30.90]Did it?
[392:36.06]With actually the new arcade is out?
[392:38.16]The new one?
[392:39.92]If that's correct, I'll be playing coin game tomorrow.
[392:44.44]Only if it's the new arcade, not survival mode.
[392:47.04]I know that they were working on a new actual full arcade again.
[392:51.84]I'll have to take a look at that.
[392:59.23]Like I said last time, if it's just the survival mode, I've already played all the games, I've already got all the tickets and everything.
[393:06.13]We'll see.
[393:06.71]If they added a new arcade, I'm going to play it tomorrow.
[393:08.56]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[393:13.37]uh probably around probably around the same time noon 12 noon pacific 12 to 1 maybe see you guys tomorrow uh we are going to go over we're gonna go take a look at the obviously the subs that came in these are all the subs from today from this stream
[393:40.83]A lot of them were gifted.
[393:41.91]So thanks guys.
[393:43.17]For the gifted subs.
[393:46.27]As always.
[393:46.71]It's a pretty good song.
[393:53.67]But no.
[393:53.91]Here's what I was going to say.
[393:55.93]What I was going to say is.
[393:57.67]It's rare for.
[394:00.30]A game like this to be in early access.
[394:01.70]And be good.
[394:03.90]It's pretty rare.
[394:04.40]So I would.
[394:06.38]Here's a full stamp of approval on this game.
[394:08.14]For sure.
[394:11.35]For sure.
[394:12.91]Any Jerma Rumble update?
[394:18.79]Well, I'll just tell you what's going to happen.
[394:22.13]So, at the end of the year, there's going to be a stream on New Year's Eve.
[394:29.45]We'll include both the award show that we typically do the last few years.
[394:35.80]and the Jerma rumble card you know like four or five matches in the rumble and in between matches we're gonna do like three or four categories because the idea was there has only been a certain amount of streams this year because I took like two or three months off so an entire quarter of this year was deleted from this stream so there's a lit there's a little bit less to kind of choose from in regards to nominations and categories
[395:03.04]So we'll do a double whammy.
[395:04.20]I just scraped your face.
[395:05.56]I'm sorry.
[395:08.76]On December 31st.
[395:12.36]And you can see the nominations Discord channel and that'll all probably exist in the next few weeks.
[395:19.44]Probably somewhere around the first of December.
[395:21.00]First week of December.
[395:21.72]Show ankles.
[395:24.93]Show ankles.
[395:28.89]One of these days, I'm just gonna do that.
[395:30.05]I'm just gonna, like, show my ankles.
[395:32.57]And it's gonna be just these big, gross... I'm gonna put, like, prosthetic feet on.
[395:38.56]And it's gonna be these big, just gross hobbit feet.
[395:43.82]These gross, just prosthetic ankles.
[395:46.20]And I'll be like, see?

[395:57.88]And then everyone would be like, no!
[396:00.04]No, no, no!
[396:01.42]Do a Vin Diesel impression.
[396:05.81]Hi.

[396:13.23]But no, it should be fun.
[396:14.59]And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[396:16.33]I'm going to run away from the computer now.
[396:19.34]Have a great night.
[396:20.16]See you tomorrow.
[396:21.64]Take care of yourselves.
[396:45.13]Oh, there's a $50 donation that came in.
[396:48.35]I missed it.
[396:50.97]It's from the Zat Zuck.
[396:54.41]The Zat Zuck IRL.
[396:56.16]Okay, good name.
[396:57.04]Right off the bat.
[396:58.66]It's a 5,000 bit, so it's 50 bucks.
[397:00.64]And then another one just came in.
[397:01.66]Another 5,000.
[397:01.86]You just... $50, $50 back-to-back.
[397:02.70]Okay.
[397:02.92]Right at the end.
[397:08.96]uh the zat zuck says Jerma I've been watching your content for over six years now started when I was like 14 how you're old I always watch your vods even if I'm working on a college assignment or something usually in the background I've been working on I've been working a great job and I've saved enough that I can finally give you support like I've always wanted to I made this Twitch account just to do so you're a funny genuine guy I hope you're doing well please use your flashlight
[397:37.09]I've said this to other people before, but knowing that some people have watched this channel since they were like 14, 15, and they're now in their 20s, it doesn't make me feel old.
[397:48.13]It just makes me feel like I hope that I haven't shaped your brain in a way that's not good.
[397:56.35]Yeah, man, all through my incredibly important developmental years where I'm incredibly influenced by a lot of things and I'm really developing as a person, I've spent the whole time pretty much watching you.
[398:06.03]I'm like, oh, well.
[398:08.95]Are you a good guy?
[398:10.09]You doing good?
[398:11.37]Things are going good, right?
[398:13.19]I didn't, like, fuck everybody up, right?
[398:19.69]Although people do write, like, show your dick and, like, show your ass crack and, like, show your feet on stream.
[398:24.09]I don't know.
[398:24.41]Did I do it?
[398:24.83]Did I mess you guys up?
[398:30.75]Nah, thanks, though.
[398:31.59]Seriously, that means a lot.
[398:34.31]And then KXZ just gave $50 with no message.
[398:36.43]Just, here's $5,000, bitch.
[398:37.49]Just here's $50.
[398:38.23]Thanks, KXZ.
[398:38.93]That's... Thank you.
[398:40.15]That's a ton of money.
[398:44.42]Now, last time I streamed, or a couple times ago, I wanted to scream.
[398:49.30]I screamed really loud and hit the end stream button, and the delay fucked it up.
[398:53.40]So we're gonna try again this time.
[399:04.29]Oh, yeah.
