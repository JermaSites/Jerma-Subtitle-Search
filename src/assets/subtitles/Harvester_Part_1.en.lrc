[00:00.39]You know what?
[00:00.85]Fuck it Friday.
[00:01.61]We're going to play Harvester.
[00:04.41]It's time to get banned from Twitch.
[00:14.25]Let's do it.
[00:20.28]I got the audio working now.
[00:26.32]Do an IRL stream and read us a book.
[00:31.64]Alright.
[00:35.98]God damn it, man.
[00:36.92]I don't even know how this game works.
[00:45.76]This was a highly requested game, and we're gonna play it for a little while.
[00:51.22]Un-fucking-believable.
[00:52.90]I'm so irritated right now by all this shit.
[00:55.16]This happens all the fucking time.
[00:59.51]This is just the dice you roll when you don't play the same fucking game every day.
[01:03.83]That's just the way it is.
[01:04.45]I'm gonna be real.
[01:06.31]I just roll these fucking dice and like, did I get a two?
[01:09.71]Ah, no, I got a four.
[01:16.02]Anyways, let's go.
[01:33.75]You didn't take Colby out with you for that.
[01:42.48]Um... Hold on, it's almost here.
[01:46.80]I'm gonna have a facecam on too.
[01:50.40]Where did I just go?
[01:51.14]Uh, this needs to be changed.
[01:59.47]God fucking damn it, man.
[02:01.13]How fucking...
[02:04.16]How fucking irritating is this?
[02:06.90]If it's irritating for you, that means it must be excruciating for me.
[02:10.19]There it is.
[02:27.02]Hey look, a video game on the screen.
[02:29.46]It's only been like fucking an hour.
[02:40.33]Turn this up.
[02:45.56]Alright.
[02:46.58]So.
[02:48.26]This is Harvester.
[02:51.62]Harvester, buckle in, boys.
[02:52.98]That Twitch staff is here now.
[02:55.08]Whoa!
[02:57.66]Let me make sure this is not delayed anymore.
[03:00.85]I'm going to have to change my type.
[03:13.23]I apologize to the 25-26 hundred people that are here.
[03:16.13]This is not how it usually is.
[03:20.80]It is.
[03:21.82]That's a lie.
[03:30.90]I don't know.
[03:31.82]Let's just say horror.
[03:32.98]Who cares?
[03:33.82]I don't need a gotcha title right now.
[03:42.67]Just point and clicky.
[03:43.60]I don't know.
[03:43.92]Point and click harder.
[03:45.00]No, but that's just basic.
[03:46.90]Point.
[03:53.86]Happy Halloween.
[03:54.52]I'm just gonna write no.
[03:55.64]Yeah, fucking happy Halloween.
[04:01.53]Happy Halloween last week.
[04:06.63]There.
[04:09.63]It's done.
[04:10.07]I'm ready.
[04:15.49]Can I get the facecam on too?
[04:16.69]Just to be like a face camera too?
[04:19.87]Where is this camera?
[04:32.26]Facecam's off.
[04:32.78]Let's delete this shit.
[04:48.58]Okay.
[04:51.31]Hi, everybody.
[04:52.05]Welcome to the stream.
[04:53.87]My name's Jerma, and this has been a fucking disaster.
[04:56.79]Yeah.
[04:58.67]One that I did not want to have happen, but, you know, sometimes, who cares?
[05:06.26]Examine the dresser.
[05:07.12]This is Harvester.
[05:07.88]We're going to start Harvester.
[05:09.10]Examine the dresser.
[05:10.36]The dresser drawer is unlocked.
[05:13.50]Now, operate the dresser.
[05:17.25]Now, this is our scary game.
[05:18.59]Happy Halloween, everybody.
[05:24.06]25 cents.
[05:25.34]I can pick it up.
[05:27.78]Examine the pen.
[05:29.30]Claw marks are visible on the end of the ballpoint pen.
[05:31.20]Pick it up.
[05:33.72]As of yet, the future is not so bright.
[05:35.29]Can I pick up the sunglasses?
[05:38.19]No.
[05:40.21]Jewels.
[05:41.27]Cigarette ashes.
[05:44.01]A giant exit screen.
[05:45.69]Was there an intro?
[05:48.02]Game audio's too loud?
[05:50.46]Let me fucking fix that shit.
[05:59.58]Turn the birds up.
[06:02.82]I missed the intro.
[06:03.69]Alright, well, we can just pretend like we already watched the intro.
[06:09.71]Anything else we need to see?
[06:10.47]Examine the bed.
[06:12.65]Old stains on the mattress.
[06:13.93]Well, that's just, that's disgusting.
[06:17.26]Binoculars.
[06:17.88]A pair of plastic binoculars with the lenses melted to the table.
[06:22.90]Acne medicine.
[06:24.06]An empty acne medicine container.
[06:29.61]Let's just walk out here.
[06:31.77]Examine the closet.
[06:33.59]Seven flannel shirts.
[06:35.19]Matching blue jeans.
[06:36.19]Okay.
[06:37.53]Examine the mirror.
[06:41.49]No, no, no.
[06:41.95]Don't operate.
[06:43.41]Get out of there.
[06:44.82]Walk out the front door.
[06:45.60]We gotta get some gameplay here.
[06:49.56]Alright.
[06:51.32]So, first things first.

[09:01.79]Okay, mom.
[09:02.67]Mom's in the kitchen, and if you bug me, I'll call her.
[09:06.25]Look, I just... Do you know me?
[09:09.40]Wish I didn't.
[09:10.68]Cause then you wouldn't be my brother.
[09:12.33]And I have your room.
[09:14.33]And all the presents are Christmas.
[09:16.65]Though I will soon enough anyway.
[09:19.03]Cause you're a lousy rat.
[09:20.95]You're my brother?
[09:22.09]No, duh.
[09:22.85]Listen, I don't mean to, uh, bug you.
[09:25.95]But I can't seem to remember anything.
[09:28.25]Will you please just tell me who you are?
[09:31.38]Mom, Steve is bugging me.
[09:34.82]He like just sang that.
[09:36.28]So this is my mother.
[09:39.10]You're a lousy rat.
[09:41.16]What did I do to you?
[09:42.00]You went and got all mushy on that girl.
[09:45.55]And now you're lighting out on me.
[09:47.83]Well, if that's the way you're gonna be, then you can drop dead.
[09:52.07]Acting is their passion.
[09:53.25]Alright, well, bye.
[09:56.23]So let's go...
[10:01.14]I can't, like, punch him.
[10:04.38]Master bedroom.
[10:06.76]Examine the cabinet.
[10:08.08]Fine bone China gleams from the mahogany shelves.
[10:13.96]I can't take any of this.
[10:14.86]Something's, like, glowing over here.
[10:16.83]There's a glow from behind the cabinet.
[10:20.43]Can't, like, move the cabinet?
[10:22.83]I guess not.
[10:26.51]Fire extinguisher?
[10:28.21]Newspaper?
[10:32.40]Use newspaper on... Harvestland.
[10:39.33]Furniture warehouse.
[10:40.17]Okay, that's me.
[10:41.05]Health indicator.
[10:43.09]Newspaper.
[10:44.49]Quarter.
[10:45.33]And a pen.
[10:47.13]Okay, good.
[10:47.95]Good to know.
[10:48.91]Let's just go into the kitchen.
[10:54.69]The voice acting strike.
[10:56.13]Isn't that over?
[11:08.58]Okay, well I can't... You guys wanted me to do it and I couldn't do it.
[11:11.68]Talk to mom.
[11:12.48]Who are you?
[11:13.41]Don't eat cookies from the trash.
[11:16.87]You're my mother?
[11:21.71]That's right.
[11:22.83]But sometimes I get treated like the hired help around here.
[11:25.51]I don't remember you.
[11:27.29]Of course you don't.
[11:28.74]Until you need your socks washed.
[11:31.00]No, you don't understand.
[11:32.24]I can't remember where I am or even who I am.
[11:35.27]Man's sake, stop your joshing, won't you?
[11:38.56]Honestly, Steve, I thought you'd grow up a little after graduation.
[11:41.82]Why do I have the facecam on?
[11:43.12]I already know that new job will plant your feet on the ground.
[11:46.04]So, that's my name.
[11:48.54]Steve is your name.
[11:49.52]Your name will be M-U-D Mudd if you don't stop teasing me, young man.
[11:54.13]Listen, this may sound strange, but I've lost my memory.
[11:59.61]Well, you always were a kidder, Steve.
[12:02.05]I'm serious.
[12:03.71]How old am I supposed to be?
[12:06.81]20?
[12:06.89]I want some cookies.
[12:10.85]The bake sale is on Friday and yet you're baking the cookies now.
[12:15.93]Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
[12:19.18]But they'll be stale by then.
[12:21.22]That's why I'm throwing them away.
[12:23.12]And then cooking more?
[12:24.45]To replace the ones I throw out.
[12:26.37]Why?
[12:28.09]Why?
[12:28.83]No one's going to pay to eat stale cookies out of the garbage can.
[12:31.85]She's stuck in an infinite loop.
[12:32.76]But you expect me to.
[12:34.54]Of course not, Steve.
[12:35.94]I wouldn't charge you.
[12:36.94]I'm your mother.
[12:38.02]Help yourself.
[12:38.78]Let me fix the screen.
[12:44.04]There you go.
[12:51.54]Sorry about that.
[12:53.73]Alright, charity bake sale.
[12:55.15]What charity is this bake sale supposed to benefit?
[12:58.23]It'll help provide a fund for bums and hobos who wander into harvest and have no family ties.
[13:03.60]Kind of a specific target group, isn't it?
[13:06.02]You have to pay attention to detail when dealing with such people.
[13:09.12]Yeah.
[13:09.44]I don't know what you mean.
[13:10.90]You will.
[13:12.31]The whole thing has been organized by the lodge.
[13:14.91]Tell me more about this bake sale.
[13:17.23]Why is it so important?
[13:18.87]As I told you, many unfortunate who come to harvest end up needing financial help.
[13:23.41]Why is that the town's problem?
[13:24.99]Alright, I'll swear it, mom.
[13:25.87]It's not a problem, so long as those folks are taken care of.
[13:29.93]Okay, other.
[13:44.26]Oh, come on.
[13:45.01]What?
[13:45.29]Come on!
[13:46.19]I wrote a whole thing.
[13:47.09]You guys would have loved it.
[13:49.57]The context is not there.
[13:52.36]This is what I was writing.
[13:57.69]Come on!
[14:29.04]There.
[14:34.20]What a thing to say to your mother.
[14:36.38]Was that an invitation now that your father is out of action?
[14:39.23]What?
[14:46.99]What?
[14:54.08]Maybe later, dear.
[14:55.32]Right now I have housework to do.
[14:57.92]So you can watch if you want.
[15:00.04]Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.
[15:01.98]You know how he gets.
[15:04.94]Wait.
[15:06.12]Wait a minute.
[15:08.88]Okay.
[15:15.70]Bye mom.
[15:17.69]Got a little weird there at the end.
[15:20.76]Fuck you, Jimmy!
[15:21.62]I don't remember what his name is.
[15:23.30]Alright, what do I do?
[15:24.92]Let's leave.
[15:25.76]Examine the... Let's go to the bedroom.
[15:26.98]Master bedroom is locked.
[15:31.20]Here's my room.
[15:33.48]Um... Examine the flute.
[15:38.31]Can't take the clarinet.
[15:39.23]What about this?
[15:39.91]Wall clock.
[15:43.55]P-51 Mustang.
[15:45.95]How old is this guy?
[15:52.30]Alright, let's go out.
[15:54.50]Let's take a look outside.
[15:56.60]Another person.
[15:57.72]Hey, his name is Jimmy.
[16:02.02]This guy's got a gun!
[16:03.38]Wait, what?
[16:13.54]What the fuck just happened?
[16:22.84]I don't have any saved games!
[16:29.85]We have to start the whole game over!
[16:37.31]Oh no!
[16:47.30]What the f- I am-
[16:51.52]I'm gonna need something besides this if we're gonna play this game.
[16:55.46]I'm gonna get a real drink.
[16:57.05]I suggest you do the same.
[16:59.65]I'll be right back.
[17:00.45]Like, I'm gonna go get a drink.
[17:02.19]This just got fucking out of control.
[17:04.04]I'm gonna... If you're over the age of 29, grab yourself a drink.
[17:08.70]Strap in.
[19:19.20]Alright.
[19:32.56]That's some Kentucky bourbon here.
[19:35.62]If you're over the age of 27 or whatever it is, whatever the legal drinking age is in whatever country you're in, I feel like I'm going to need this.
[19:42.81]Let's go.
[19:47.98]I haven't like been keeping up with bits or anything either.
[19:49.87]I'm sorry.
[19:50.29]I apologize for that too.
[19:51.95]But like this has just been, this has been like just an outrageous evening so far.
[19:56.17]So sorry about that.
[19:57.39]It's good stuff.
[20:04.14]I'm gonna be drinking out of this little sippy cup.
[20:08.52]I'll be drinking out of a little like espresso sippy cup.
[20:25.29]Little baby.
[20:27.41]Hey, look at my little baby cup.
[20:30.31]Fucking idiot.
[20:31.85]I think that's coal or something.
[20:33.01]Sounds like a grenade.
[20:50.14]Alright, uh, but let's just go right to it.
[20:55.21]Don't punch Jimmy.
[21:04.11]Examine the mailbox.
[21:06.19]Okay, just talk to Jimmy.
[21:07.71]Hey Steve, I'm Jimmy James.
[21:09.21]Remember me?
[21:10.59]Uh, I guess not.
[21:12.73]Hey, how come you haven't been putting the paper out for me in the morning?
[21:19.59]Uh... I... I'm supposed to?
[21:21.68]I don't remember.
[21:22.32]Yeah?
[21:22.88]Well, try to remember, will ya?
[21:24.44]Sure.
[21:25.16]How'd you expect a working Joe to make an honest living?
[21:28.47]You don't put the paper out, I'm out of a job!
[21:30.75]Cheers.
[21:31.50]So what?
[21:32.50]You don't get paid for picking up papers anyway.
[21:34.62]That's smooth.
[21:35.20]I sent an old building burnt down.
[21:36.85]What the heck else am I supposed to do?
[21:39.23]Listen, start putting that paper out and everything will be Jake, okay?
[21:43.51]That's all I want.
[21:44.29]Wait, I have a newspaper, don't I?
[21:46.39]Walking this route every day... Punch him to death so you can get his gun.
[21:49.93]You got any spare sneakers?
[21:53.09]Spare sneakers, I sure do!
[21:54.33]Whoa, that's great!
[21:55.67]Maybe we could trade.
[21:56.57]This guy's a vendor?
[21:58.73]You know Miss Whaley and Principal Harold down at the school?
[22:01.91]Well, I found out they're messing around with each other in the broom closet.
[22:06.21]I can tell you when they meet and trade you some keys that'll let you catch them red-handed.
[22:11.44]What do you say?
[22:13.66]Uh, okay, take the sneakers.
[22:14.84]Am I giving them my shoes?
[22:16.72]Before I give away the keys, let me see those sneakers.
[22:20.06]First the keys, then the sneakers.
[22:22.88]Nuh-uh.
[22:23.54]If you're trying to pull a fast one on me, forget it.
[22:26.94]You don't get the keys till I see the sneakers.
[22:29.52]And that's that.
[22:31.14]See you later, alligator.
[22:33.60]Okay, so, uh, let me go get the newspaper.
[22:35.96]Uh, newspaper, I gotta get all the shit that's in the bedroom.
[22:42.04]Uh, it was the, what was it?
[22:46.91]I clicked on a bunch of random shit.
[22:48.11]The drawer, inside the drawer.
[22:50.83]Grab the cigarette.
[22:51.71]Grab the e-cig.
[22:54.01]Grab the... I was going to say it, but I'm not going to.
[22:59.15]Yeah, you guys know what I was going to say.
[23:00.47]I've been on it for like a week or two now, just like talking about it.
[23:03.23]I'm not going to say it.
[23:07.41]Okay, what else?
[23:08.49]Acne medicine.
[23:09.11]Can I pick it up?
[23:10.43]No.
[23:11.77]Save.
[23:12.55]Thank you.
[23:14.96]Thank you.
[23:20.38]Save.
[23:21.90]You got it.
[23:27.61]Basketball?
[23:29.35]No.
[23:30.15]Heater?
[23:33.05]Bookshelf?
[23:33.69]No, I got everything, right?
[23:34.93]Yeah.
[23:36.55]Where's the, uh... Where's the newspaper?
[23:39.19]Oh, in here.
[23:41.55]Go get the newspaper, put it in your inventory.
[23:43.43]Well, that didn't work.
[23:44.49]Here, just take my newspaper, right?
[23:49.38]Newspaper.
[23:51.31]Use newspaper on... You leave that newspaper out right now!
[24:02.56]Do I do that?
[24:07.18]I guess I don't have to do it.

[24:14.63]A Dayglo Lima space disk stuck on the roof.
[24:19.69]I'm not saying it.
[24:21.41]I'm holding back a lot of stupid fucking references, by the way.
[24:24.81]First, I was going to say Bitcoin.
[24:26.65]Then I was going to say Breaking Bad Pizza.
[24:29.16]Not doing them tonight.
[24:29.98]You're getting fresh material.
[24:34.48]Let's go to the mailbox.
[24:35.24]It's full of junk mail, bills, and bake sale flyers.

[25:18.04]Uh, examine the flyer.
[25:19.14]Harvest bake sale is Friday in the school gym.
[25:23.38]Can I go in?
[25:24.81]It's probably locked.
[25:25.41]No, I can go in.
[25:29.13]Okay.
[25:29.47]We can talk to our first side character.
[25:32.49]Alice from the Brady Bunch.
[25:36.15]Who are you?
[25:38.87]This is Phelps General Store.
[25:40.61]So who would that make me?
[25:42.65]Maybe you need to go back to Geen Memorial and have Miss Whaley teach you about logic.
[25:46.41]Okay.
[25:47.01]I'm fuzzy on a lot of things.
[25:48.22]The missiles are for safety reasons?
[25:49.64]My memory's gone.
[25:51.42]Shaw, you always were a kidder, Steve.
[25:54.44]I'm serious.
[25:55.18]I need some help.
[25:55.98]Do they take drugs now?
[25:58.00]Well, they say a sharp blow to the head is a good thing for amnesia.
[26:01.97]Oh, say fuck again.
[26:02.53]Say fuck to the NPC.
[26:03.39]Ow, my finger.

[27:14.58]Slightly used wrench.

[27:19.14]A cow is bleeding of robust coffee on these Harvest Blend coffee labels.
[27:23.91]An adult magazine for 25 cents.
[27:26.83]You must pay her before you can buy anything.
[27:29.25]I have a quarter, right?
[27:31.77]I do have 25 cents.

[27:38.33]Alright, let's pay her.

[28:01.22]How do I just pull back?
[28:01.98]Oh, there it is.
[28:04.56]Here you go, Mrs. Phelps.
[28:06.00]Take the quarter.
[28:10.71]The only thing a quarter will buy you is an adult magazine.
[28:14.55]A girly magazine?
[28:16.24]Why, Steve, I'm surprised at you.
[28:19.04]I'd expect that sort of thing from Deputy Loomis, but never from you.

[28:23.88]You know I'm coming in here ogling the girly magazines behind my counter.
[28:28.20]Darned if I'd sell any of those.

[28:33.41]Well, will you sell me one?
[28:34.57]You're gonna get in big trouble.
[28:35.79]I certainly will, Steve.
[28:37.53]That kind of interest is healthy for a young fellow.
[28:41.19]Alright, so let's... I already took it.
[28:48.33]I already got it.
[28:51.79]Okay, so we got the magazine.
[28:53.15]Okay, we're good.
[28:59.35]There's no bad material in here.
[29:00.97]There's nothing awful to see.
[29:02.40]Alright, I got the magazine.
[29:05.68]I think that lets us leave now.
[29:10.24]Yes.
[29:10.86]Let me just save it.

[29:17.42]Let's see.
[29:21.70]Okay.
[29:25.74]So now I got a dirty magazine.
[29:26.90]I hate calling it that.
[29:28.38]I hate that.
[29:31.09]We've talked about this before, I think.
[29:33.15]I hate the word porn.
[29:36.13]Pornography.
[29:36.99]It just sounds so awful.
[29:38.85]There's not a better name we can call that doesn't sound gross.
[29:44.91]Porno.
[29:46.01]It's got to be something nicer sounding.
[29:50.53]I hate the way that word sounds.
[29:55.66]Cup.
[29:57.18]A crushed paper cup with smudged lipstick on it.
[30:00.28]Okay, that's not a manhole.
[30:03.80]Flag.
[30:04.36]An old glory flag.

[30:17.07]Let's just talk to the postman.
[30:18.71]Yes?
[30:19.53]I need some help.
[30:20.75]Mr. Postmaster Boyle, what can I do for you today?
[30:24.67]Mr. Boyle?
[30:26.78]I'd like a lodge application.
[30:27.84]I was just like, I'd like a lodge application.
[30:29.04]Give this guy the porno magazine and he'll give it to me.
[30:44.95]Well, can I go get one at the lodge instead?
[30:46.87]Come on, it won't kill you to make a lousy copy.
[30:49.33]It's not the effort, son.
[30:50.95]It's the principle.
[30:52.54]We must adhere to our standards.
[30:54.52]They're all that stand between civilization and chaos.
[30:58.49]I'm sorry, you'll just have to come back in a month, same as anyone else.
[31:02.23]And even then, I can't guarantee you'll get an application.
[31:04.97]The line is always long, and they are never enough to go around.
[31:08.60]It's very important that I get in quickly.
[31:11.16]That's what they all say.
[31:12.56]Postmaster Boyle, I'll just die if I don't get into the lodge.
[31:16.10]I can't make an exception, young man.
[31:17.78]It just wouldn't be right.
[31:19.42]I can't- I'm not gonna kill this guy.
[31:21.02]Alright, let's say, uh, fuck, hee hee.
[31:22.68]Don't mumble, son.
[31:23.88]Can't understand you.
[31:28.00]Don't mumble, son.
[31:29.18]Can't understand you.
[31:38.77]Don't mumble, son.
[31:39.97]Can't understand you.
[31:48.12]Don't mumble, son.
[31:49.02]Alright, we can't do this.
[31:49.78]It's over.
[31:51.70]Bye.
[31:52.46]Next time you post, don't forget the zip code.
[31:55.18]Let's talk to the lady.
[31:55.94]A blind woman is trying to read her mail.
[32:01.07]Can I help her with this?
[32:05.23]Examine the boxes.
[32:06.14]No.
[32:06.98]Okay.
[32:07.46]Let me... Let me try to give him the point.
[32:13.06]I thought he was going to say, that interests me.
[32:18.16]Newspaper, pen.
[32:20.12]Probably going to have to come back here at some point.
[32:21.74]Alright, let's go.
[32:26.61]No, I'm not punching anybody.
[32:28.31]The blind lady is going to shoot me.
[32:32.60]Examine the woman.
[32:33.78]I just did.
[32:40.28]Fine.
[32:43.97]Fine.
[32:50.21]I'm not even on the right 3D plane.
[32:51.91]I can't do anything.
[32:55.29]We're on the wrong plane.
[32:56.33]She's in the background.
[33:01.78]No, it ain't gonna work.
[33:04.16]What is that?
[33:06.08]It just gave me an option to do something.
[33:08.62]No, it didn't.
[33:09.00]Okay.
[33:13.09]Uh, let's just go.
[33:16.73]Mm-hmm.
[33:20.59]Make our way back to the street.
[33:24.23]Really weird placement.
[33:25.39]Okay, we got the general store, post office, the lodge, the barbershop.
[33:29.51]We gotta examine all the places first.
[33:33.20]Barbershop.
[33:33.76]Okay.
[33:39.58]Examine the sheep.
[33:41.31]Except for its occasional hairball cough, it's hard to tell if the sheep is alive or not.
[33:46.95]Mr. Pastorelli, Mr. Swell, Mr. Parsons.
[33:51.86]Okay, let's just...
[33:53.91]Mr. Passarelli doesn't respond, not understanding English.
[33:56.63]Okay.
[33:57.77]What about Mr. Swell?
[33:58.65]Howdy, Steve.
[34:00.19]Yeah.
[34:01.23]Howdy back, Mr. Pete Swell, Steve.
[34:05.15]Don't you pull my old leg now.
[34:07.39]This game is a mess.
[34:08.80]I need a game guide.
[34:09.80]What are you talking about?
[34:11.08]That's what you guys are here for, to help me.
[34:12.26]I really think you should talk your father into buying some.
[34:15.70]He can afford it.
[34:17.50]And I can't stress enough the value of some really fine William Siding.
[34:23.02]Keeps it warm in the summer, cool in the winter, and it keeps out the heat.
[34:28.28]Pastorelli oughta look into some, but I can't get him to understand a word I say.
[34:38.47]Ask Clem Parsons how he follows me with the alarm system in here.
[34:46.35]I'm a bummer.
[34:47.67]I could fix it for him, but he just won't listen.
[34:52.12]Plumbing.
[34:53.66]Aluminum siding actually is doing very well right now, I think.
[34:57.34]Age of Empires sheep sound effect.
[34:59.38]He looks like... He looks like a guy that I know.
[35:22.65]Right now he does.
[35:24.29]That's a guy's face that I know in reality.
[35:29.69]Let's write his full name and his address.
[35:35.03]Um...
[35:43.23]Tools stop running around now.
[35:46.13]We don't need to know this anyway go goodbye Last guy to interact with Mr... Parsons.

[36:03.62]You think this guy's into porno?
[36:05.88]One of these guys is into porno.
[36:06.96]You don't cross the intergalactic void without learning a trick or two.
[36:11.62]You know what Pastor Ellie did?
[36:13.24]Yesterday, he gets an alarm system to protect his pole.
[36:17.00]Only he don't know how to rig it, so now it's all a ride.
[36:23.29]Alarm system.
[36:24.68]Pastorelli shelled out for an alarm system alright, but he's too cheap to hire an electrician to hook her up.
[36:30.74]Dang idiot cross-wired it through the fire sprinkler.
[36:34.10]So now when the alarm goes off, it sets the sprinkler spray.
[36:37.87]The guy that can't speak English communicates through porno.
[36:44.39]He's gonna like point at the naked people and be like, he's gonna be like, like a pair of boobs.
[36:48.79]That's like B. He's trying to say like, no, no, B. B-O-O-BOO!

[36:57.45]Aliens.
[36:57.99]Well, son, the ways of the alien is a specialized area of woodcraft unknown to all but the wiliest sportsmen.
[37:07.43]What you gotta remember is, your average alien is smarter than your average human.
[37:12.40]So you gotta be extra careful, Bill, and you're blind if you want a bad one.
[37:16.08]You... hunt aliens.
[37:17.52]You understand, right?
[37:18.80]Son, after you've invaded an alien, you can never go back to quail.
[37:23.59]What?
[37:24.07]You think you can get one of those?
[37:25.17]Cut scene!
[37:30.45]Line your blind with lead to fool their senses.
[37:33.15]What the fuck was that?
[37:34.25]Lay real quiet.
[37:35.51]Why did that happen?
[37:36.77]Preferably in the woods around the nuclear base.
[37:39.37]Oh, they love messing around out there.
[37:41.62]Why not wait outside your field, Clem?
[37:44.34]Looks exactly like this guy.
[37:47.28]All they do, they're crop doodles.
[37:48.70]Where was that alien?
[37:50.12]Don't you know nothing?
[37:51.60]Besides, ain't no place to put the blind out in the field.
[37:55.25]Now, you listen to Clem Parsons if you want to tag...
[37:58.68]Well, that didn't work.
[38:29.81]Doesn't respond.
[38:32.79]Try to give the alien a porn magazine.
[38:36.83]Yeah, I see.
[38:38.61]So what?
[38:40.79]What?
[38:40.97]You don't like it?
[38:41.55]Oh, that ain't so much.
[38:47.69]Okay.
[38:49.26]Pitchfork.
[38:49.70]I can't talk now.
[38:52.44]Anytime.
[38:52.96]Is there anything else I can do in here?
[38:55.98]Coat rack.
[38:58.22]Barbapole.
[39:01.02]The sheep is meowing right now.
[39:04.38]What is it buying?
[39:05.06]What does the sheep do?
[39:07.58]Pastorelli motions you to stay away from the switch.
[39:12.24]Okay, I don't think there's anything I can do in here.
[39:13.60]Alright.
[39:19.75]The lodge is the next actual, I believe, place to go.
[39:22.73]I need to talk to a certain... Okay.
[39:28.83]This is not what I thought this was going to be.
[39:31.08]Alarming green sludge oozes from the drain.
[39:35.00]Red eyes gleam with eerie malevolence from the darkness.
[39:38.70]Talk to the sergeant at arms.
[39:39.92]Only initiates may enter the hall of the Order of the Harvest Moon.
[39:45.27]Did you say something?
[39:47.59]Dr. Claw from Inspector Gadget.
[39:49.47]I did not speak, but my mind touched yours.
[39:54.53]Telepathy?
[39:56.11]But how?
[39:57.31]Only those who seek enlightenment warrant my attention.
[40:07.67]An application Take this job application.
[40:13.16]Do you like to carve up bodies?
[40:22.25]Give me an application.
[40:23.05]Applications are available at the post office.
[40:27.13]Postmaster Boyle disseminates them to the uninitiated.
[40:31.50]So the guy at the post office gives them.
[40:33.56]Can I just fill it out and return it to you or what?
[40:36.68]I need to get an application.
[40:38.40]Do you find it difficult to obtain an application?
[40:41.52]Use the porn bag as your application.
[40:44.29]Postmaster Boyle to give you one in the middle of the month as it is against his rules.
[40:50.39]Alright, so we have to make the postmaster give us something.
[40:55.35]Give us the application.
[40:57.95]Alright, so this is a cult.
[40:59.22]It's going to be about how I'm in a cult, and I do cult things, and... We go to the missile base just to see, like, this guy is in half.
[41:08.10]Oh, who goes there?
[41:10.10]Uh, they tell me my name is Steve.
[41:13.61]Oh, right.
[41:14.93]Section 21.
[41:17.41]Time for a punch.
[41:19.09]No, not yet.
[41:20.71]That makes two of us.
[41:26.26]Just another draft dodging ploy the way I see it.
[41:29.62]But at least you're not an alien.
[41:31.56]Who are you?
[41:32.36]So aliens land, I get it.
[41:33.26]Colonel Buster Monroe, commander of the Harvest Nuclear Missile Installation.
[41:37.59]These are all nukes.
[41:38.23]Keeping America safe from those who would die of flag red, white, and pink.
[41:43.25]These are nuclear missiles?
[41:45.73]That was my reaction.
[41:47.67]Every one of them ready to rain death on the roosters.
[41:49.91]Just nuclear codes.
[41:50.90]All I gotta do is hit the button and blammo.
[41:54.16]The price of vodka goes through the roof.
[41:57.26]Along with the vodka.
[41:58.96]Why would vodka go on?
[41:59.74]Well, I suppose you have, you know... That doesn't make much sense.
[42:02.98]Safeguards against... Safeguards?
[42:06.08]Don't be such a weak sister.
[42:07.58]There are no safeguards.
[42:08.52]There are no safeguards.
[42:10.36]This is the 50s.
[42:11.64]Well, we just figured out the time period.
[42:12.80]Then you have sole control of the, uh, missiles.
[42:17.82]That's right.
[42:18.92]Been in... When I got my lower torso shot off in the war.
[42:23.89]I'm not gonna give this guy the porn magazine.
[42:25.63]He doesn't have a penis.
[42:26.31]It's not gonna happen.
[42:27.13]Jesus Christ!
[42:43.76]It was too emotionally unstable to continue in the military.
[42:47.32]That's why they gave me this nice cushy job and put me in charge of the nuclear missiles.
[42:52.55]That's not a cushy job.
[42:53.53]That's a very dangerous job.
[42:54.87]The button.
[42:58.31]There's a button.
[42:59.01]Why are you asking about the button, son?
[43:01.73]I'm just a little nervous about it.
[43:03.85]I mean, suppose an accident happens.
[43:06.37]I'm gonna, like, end up pressing the button.
[43:10.00]That's really close to... If he leans forward, we all die.
[43:11.88]It's like... Alright.
[43:12.32]That's not fucking safe.
[43:14.28]That's pretty fucked up.
[43:34.69]Harvest is a fine town.
[43:36.57]Steeped in traditional American values.
[43:39.29]But that lodge... Just send a nuke over to the lodge.
[43:42.88]Don't mind saying it.
[43:44.76]They've got their fingers into everything around here.
[43:48.52]Like a certain red commie bastard menace which shall be nameless.
[43:56.05]Sorry, Colonel.
[43:56.73]I've decided to join the lodge.
[43:57.95]That might work out for the best, mister.
[44:00.26]I think you should join the lodge, infiltrate it, and report back on any red sympathizers.
[44:05.62]Okay.
[44:06.20]The report could affect my decision on what I've got to do.
[44:12.32]Call me bastard.
[44:13.36]Frankly, all these questions are making me a little suspicious of you.
[44:18.20]Maybe you're one of those pink-blooded Americans.
[44:21.76]Can you give me any reason why I shouldn't shoot you right now?
[44:26.42]What do you mean, shoot me right now?
[44:27.50]You can't shoot me.
[44:28.20]I'm an American.
[44:28.80]I have rights.
[44:30.29]Right, huh?
[44:31.81]Your average commie bastard is always only too ready to hide behind the Constitution.
[44:36.55]I'm not gonna die here, am I?
[44:38.41]Real Americans waive their rights for the common good.
[44:40.87]Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not, whoa!
[44:42.85]Would you?
[44:44.64]I sure I would for this great country of ours.
[44:46.58]Hell no, I refuse this role.
[44:47.70]Like, this is the, we have to, that, we, this guy's gonna shoot us.
[44:50.52]So, I have to, like, we have to play his little game here.
[44:55.12]For the great country!
[44:56.54]You talk a good game, mister.
[44:58.94]God.
[44:59.12]Communists can hardly be said to hold a monopoly on intellectual discourse.
[45:02.62]I don't think much stuff... I don't think about that.
[45:21.23]Communists can hardly be said to hold a monopoly on intellectual discourse.
[45:24.75]You should have watched more TV and read less Dostoevsky if you wanted to pass for an American.
[45:31.02]How do I run?
[45:32.12]How do I run?
[45:33.38]What the fuck?
[45:34.14]What the fuck?
[46:02.39]You don't shoot that weapon with one hand.
[46:05.83]One bullet hit me in the face.
[46:07.99]Ayayay, where was that saved?
[46:12.59]Like, everybody died.
[46:15.84]That's alright.
[46:16.38]Look, we need to convince him to let us in here.
[46:18.86]Okay.
[46:18.96]Application.
[46:29.15]I certainly don't wish to discourage you from joining, young man.
[46:32.31]That's just what you should be striving for.
[46:34.91]But I can't- Damn it.
[46:38.50]Favors.
[46:39.56]Don't mumble, son.
[46:41.66]Next time you pu- Alright, newspaper, pen.
[46:49.58]What am I supposed to do about this shit?
[46:57.80]Damn it.
[47:01.55]Can't do anything.
[47:01.99]We have a pen.
[47:03.87]Do you want a pen?
[47:04.49]I think I have to get an item from him.
[47:11.67]I'm assuming, right?
[47:12.43]We gotta get something from that guy.
[47:13.71]There's no way that that's not a possibility.
[47:17.03]Let's go to the missile base.
[47:19.50]I'm gonna save the game, and we're gonna get this dialog option correct.
[47:28.73]Okay.
[47:31.39]Buster Monroe.
[47:32.91]Alright.
[47:33.55]Yeah, yeah, makes two of us.
[47:35.81]We can just get to the part where, okay, this guy is, you might be a commie.
[47:42.67]Okay.
[47:45.81]Alright, so.
[47:46.93]He's in charge of the missiles.
[47:48.89]Emotional instant, don't say that.
[47:52.92]Call me bastards.
[47:54.08]Frankly, all these questions are making me a little suspicious of you.
[47:57.62]What the fuck?
[47:58.94]Maybe you're one of those pink-blooded Americans.
[48:02.50]Can you give me any reason why... Can I give you any reason?
[48:06.50]No, not really.
[48:07.32]I appreciate your honesty.
[48:09.40]See, that's what I wanted to hear.
[48:11.82]Oh, goddammit, no!
[48:19.20]Okay, that was wrong.
[48:20.70]I don't think there's a correct path with this guy.
[48:30.10]I don't think I can do this.
[48:32.52]Oh.
[48:35.40]There's a lot more.
[48:36.20]Okay.
[48:36.80]Meat plant.
[48:38.52]TV station.
[48:39.10]Holy shit.
[48:40.00]Okay, this is a lot more than I thought was going to be around here.
[48:42.60]Johnson residence.
[48:44.53]Let's go to the Johnson residence.
[49:06.45]What does he have?
[49:07.26]He's got like a shoelace.
[49:16.52]How much does it take to fucking get rid of an old man?
[49:21.51]I just heard The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time chicken sound.
[49:24.57]This is dragging out.
[49:29.23]I'm going to leave.
[49:35.92]Okay.
[49:44.00]Hey, you fucking copy bastard.
[49:47.50]This time, maybe I can get the...
[49:50.69]Let's talk to him.
[49:52.36]Holy shit.
[49:54.10]This is a dead guy.
[49:54.86]This guy's dead.
[49:57.64]His eyes are like glazed over.
[49:59.26]You should be ecstatic considering what you're getting into.
[50:04.83]If you haven't gotten into it already.
[50:08.73]Speaking of which, I heard Stephanie was grounded.
[50:12.75]You hear this?
[50:13.33]Her daddy's worried about getting his meat.
[50:16.88]So if I were him, I'd be more concerned about Stephanie getting some meat.
[50:23.34]Uh, right.
[50:24.42]And you are?
[50:26.38]You always were a kidder, Steve.
[50:29.29]I'm Mr. Johnson, remember?
[50:31.37]Glad his face finally changed.
[50:34.49]Just got finished waxing the tucker.
[50:37.53]I could use a little relaxation.
[50:40.89]But since Edna's not here...
[50:43.41]I might as well talk to you.
[50:45.35]Who sits... Why isn't he up here?
[50:47.01]Why would you be down here?
[50:48.53]Alright.
[50:48.99]Stephanie.
[50:49.63]Speaking of Stephanie, I still haven't gotten an invitation to the wedding yet.
[50:55.50]I don't have anything to do with that.
[50:59.06]That's okay.
[51:00.62]Personally, I'd prefer a pass to the honeymoon.
[51:05.22]You could use the backseat of my Tucker for the maiden voyage.
[51:09.71]I'd drive you around.
[51:10.65]It's plenty big.
[51:12.17]Believe you me, I'd drive you around.
[51:16.25]And I wouldn't look in the back seat.
[51:18.07]I guarantee it.
[51:20.11]Though if you'd like to come up front and take the wheel a while, I wouldn't say nay.
[51:26.64]No, this guy sucks.
[51:29.58]Bye now.
[51:31.58]This guy definitely wants the porn.
[51:34.02]There's no way he's not going to want this.
[51:35.72]That really doesn't interest me, Steve.
[51:39.68]Okay.
[51:40.98]During the day, Mr. Johnson keeps watch over his precious 48 Tucker.
[51:45.64]I don't think I can go in the house.
[51:47.66]You hear that?
[51:48.02]Okay.
[51:51.32]Somebody's shooting those chickens.
[51:53.50]Examine the garage.
[51:55.30]Mr. Johnson erected an impenetrable fortress to protect his Tucker during the night.
[52:01.03]So we're gonna come here during the night.
[52:14.12]Okay, I can't move.
[52:15.10]Alright, let's get away from this, like, weird creepy guy and, like, the zip up.
[52:20.70]Alright, um... Fire station.
[52:25.01]Let's just go.
[52:25.49]Let's go, like, around.
[52:26.31]Let's go, let's go, let's go clockwise.
[52:28.55]You know what I mean?
[52:29.03]Let's go clockwise.
[52:31.45]Fire station.
[52:32.23]Save.
[52:33.03]Is there a quick save or do I have to keep doing this shit?
[52:40.76]God, what is with these background sounds?
[52:44.04]Listen to the background sounds.
[52:46.71]It's like there's animals being killed.
[52:48.95]At first it was chickens being shot, now it's like dogs getting beat up.
[52:54.89]Like, what the fuck is going on here?
[52:56.21]Alright, let's talk to the fireman.
[53:00.61]Please excuse the mess.
[53:03.34]They've done wonders with the upstairs bedroom, but this garage defies color coordination.
[53:08.66]Okay.
[53:11.68]Stop hitting your fucking dog, man.
[53:13.92]I don't like that sound in the background.
[53:20.24]Okay.
[53:21.63]Sorry, Steve.
[53:22.81]After I'm through here, I've got cleaning to do.
[53:25.31]Rush, rush.
[53:28.73]Alright.
[53:29.39]You want the porno magazine?
[53:31.01]Sorry, Steve.
[53:34.01]Let's go in the firehouse.
[53:40.69]What is this?
[53:41.24]This is the fire station?
[53:43.52]Dog, stop.
[53:44.62]Stop it.
[53:46.56]How do I stop?
[53:47.20]Dog, would you like to give them the fucking porn?
[53:49.71]Well, that didn't work.
[53:51.23]Oh, this is noisy.
[53:52.57]Newspaper.
[53:53.91]Okay.
[53:54.56]Eat the newspaper.
[53:59.12]Putting out any fires?
[54:00.84]Don't bother me.
[54:01.54]I'm sketching.
[54:02.12]Oh, look what you made me do.
[54:05.14]What the fuck is going on right here?
[54:07.76]Oh, cut it out, Spot.
[54:09.55]Honestly.
[54:10.83]Once he gets barking, a good piece of meat is the only way to shut him up.
[54:15.69]Oh, no.
[54:18.11]Oh!
[54:18.23]There you go, Spot.
[54:25.81]So, Steve, bet you don't remember me.
[54:28.77]Like, separate cutscene.
[54:32.51]I'm Fire Marshal Sparky, head of your fire department.
[54:40.12]Uh, then why are you sketching a nude men in the fire department?
[54:44.35]That was so funny.
[54:47.45]Is that like somebody's foot?
[54:54.35]That was like somebody's foot with an ankle.
[54:57.90]That was a terrible drawing.
[54:59.06]This guy's awful.
[54:59.96]That was bad.
[55:12.41]Uh-oh.
[55:13.21]Okay.
[55:14.53]Uh, Spots.
[55:15.59]Spots is a dandy watchdog.
[55:18.27]But like the rest of us, he has one awful vice.
[55:21.60]None of us can resist a nice cup of meat.
[55:29.38]Ay-yi-yi.
[55:31.16]Art enriches the community, Steve.
[55:33.44]This is, like, just embarrassing for me.
[55:35.42]No less than an open fire hose or a fireman beating down a blazing door.
[55:39.28]It keeps showing the guy's, like, ass.
[55:40.98]Oh, what if we're drawing a nude man?
[55:42.42]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:43.01]Nice foot.
[55:43.49]What if all we ever draw is a nude man or the same nude man?
[55:46.85]Do you hear the spaceship?
[55:48.23]...sorts of provocative positions.
[55:50.41]I can't take it, man.
[55:51.25]Content, not content.
[55:52.73]Content, not content.
[55:53.71]Content, you see?
[55:54.21]He gets it.
[55:54.73]Content.
[55:55.47]Steve, it's beneath you.
[55:58.93]uh wasp woman some people think all we do is sit around sketching fetching examples of manhood for our own amusement nothing could be further from the truth why just the other day we cited ted to a crumb for fire code violations this guy's just sitting here the whole time listening dried out paper walk nest clustered around our wooden house why it's a chem log just waiting for the right faggot
[56:25.33]Believe me, none of us wants to see another fiasco like the Sentinel fire.
[56:37.97]How was that newspaper fire, sir?
[56:40.45]You wouldn't think that a brick and steel building with a sprinkler system could go up that quickly.
[56:46.40]And there it goes!
[56:48.94]Uh, alright, uh...
[56:52.28]You think it was arson.
[56:53.08]Maybe you were too busy drawing to put out the... Maybe you were too busy drawing.
[56:56.02]This guy's not nude, by the way.
[56:58.51]This guy is very clearly clothed.
[57:00.47]He said the same thing.
[57:20.85]Same thing?
[57:21.29]Okay.
[57:21.40]Is the cup getting smaller?
[57:21.96]No.
[57:22.02]It's the same size the whole time.
[57:44.26]Forget it.
[57:45.32]Look, Steve, as far as I know, the fire was an accident.
[57:49.32]Oh, shit.
[57:49.98]Now don't you go moving.
[57:54.24]Okay, I got real scared there for a second.
[57:58.62]I don't converse on the job, Steve.
[58:02.87]Ay-yi-yi, alright.
[58:06.01]Can't do anything else here.
[58:13.75]Newspaper?
[58:15.73]Like what about, what do you think about the newspaper?
[58:17.39]What's that got to do with me?
[58:18.93]Nothing, apparently.
[58:19.77]Okay, let's just go.
[58:25.24]Prepare the censor bar.
[58:26.42]Alright, um... I have to find a way to get into the lodge.
[58:30.86]How do I convince the guy to let me in?
[58:32.12]We're getting banned tonight, boys and girls!
[58:41.39]Prepare the ban.
[58:43.79]Because it's going to happen at some point.
[58:46.37]72 hour display of... Wait a second.
[58:59.88]72 hours.
[59:02.86]It's alright.
[59:04.68]I don't stream until Tuesday.
[59:07.66]Don't worry about it.
[59:08.50]I'm good to go.
[59:11.78]Examine the ashes.
[59:14.24]What's left of the newspaper building after an extreme fire.
[59:16.48]Okay.
[59:17.22]So, whatever.
[59:23.12]Can I examine the shovel?
[59:25.67]Gotta do quick math in my brain.
[59:27.25]It's quick math.
[59:29.33]Alright, I got a shovel now.
[59:36.27]Combining items.
[59:39.98]Prepare the Garfield.
[59:44.70]I think that's all I can get here.
[59:49.35]Police station.
[59:52.89]What is this guy doing?
[59:55.85]Writing a bug report?
[59:59.31]Cop doubles as a programmer.
[60:02.77]Alright, here comes like the overly over-the-top like sheriff act.
[60:06.72]Hello, Steve.
[60:08.22]Let me introduce myself.
[60:10.16]I'm Sheriff Dwayne Dwayne, and this here is Loomis.
[60:13.86]Pleasure, I reckon.
[60:15.62]Then we haven't met before?
[60:18.69]Of course we have, but I heard about your alleged amnesia.
[60:22.47]And this brutal, unbelievable, horrible violence is fine, but half a butt cheek and you're fucked.
[60:28.52]You're gone.
[60:29.40]Keep your nose clean.

[60:48.43]Well, you've always been a kidder, Steve.
[60:51.33]Everybody uses that excuse.
[60:52.87]Oh, you're such a kidder, Steve.
[60:54.17]Boy, you need to stop all this funning and get serious.
[60:57.89]You've got a wedding coming up soon.
[60:59.35]So I'm getting married, okay.
[61:00.80]You should be thinking about your career and about joining the lodge.
[61:07.60]Those aren't the rules.
[61:08.28]Games and small amounts of nudity are fine.
[61:09.98]I know, I'm just kidding around.
[61:11.94]Just joking around.
[61:13.77]amnesia or just joking around you can't have forgotten you're about to marry the prettiest little thing at harvest I think where is Stephanie perfect for each other I just hope her father's disappointment doesn't spoil everything disappoint say fuck oh my god Mr. potsdam wants to hold the wedding in the lodge but he'll never get in like all the rest he's always hanging around the post office the first day of the month
[61:39.27]Waiting for Boyle to bring out that month's lodge application.
[61:41.97]I'm just laughing about it a little bit.
[61:43.71]There's always a long line.
[61:46.05]Never enough applications to go around.
[61:47.71]It's kind of like he's asleep talking.
[61:48.87]And even if you do get an application, chances are you're right out of luck.
[61:54.27]You are called to the order and even less accepted.
[61:57.53]And Potsdam, well, they've turned him down so many times.
[62:02.61]Unless he does something radical, he'll never get in.
[62:08.02]Alright, uh, how do I get into the lodge?
[62:10.14]Is there a way to get in?
[62:10.84]Cult, everybody's involved.
[62:12.52]How can I get an application?
[62:13.52]Shit.
[62:13.62]Okay.
[62:13.76]Anything I can take from here?
[62:38.14]I'm not going to punch the sheriff.
[62:39.84]That's a guarantee.
[62:40.84]Fine.
[62:41.04]You want to see the guaranteed dead?
[62:43.78]Let's watch me guarantee lose the game.
[62:45.16]I'm going to punch him in the back and he's going to turn around and shoot me in the face.
[62:51.75]I can't even get down to his level, so it doesn't matter.
[62:55.81]That coffee sure smells good.
[62:58.06]help yourself speaking of which you're real lucky to be marrying Stephanie she don't look like a good woman I just hope she don't turn out like Mrs. loomis her mercy forbid Mrs. phelps
[63:18.19]good women can be awful hard on a man's needs don't you know Jesus Christ okay um what's what are a man's needs why you sure ought to appreciate what a man's gotta do sometimes in a parked car or waist high not holding a tree or jail cell at noon
[63:40.83]Matter of fact, Mrs. Phelps got no reason not to sell you some of them French postcards.
[63:49.44]We found our mark.
[63:51.38]It's this guy.
[63:55.06]Bring them around when the sheriff's at lunch and I'd be obliged.
[64:04.03]I have to wait until the sheriff leaves?
[64:06.73]Yes.
[64:09.35]Oh, I seen you brung me a girly picture, boy.
[64:14.93]Afternoon?
[64:17.39]What?
[64:18.88]All these doors are locked.
[64:19.64]How do I get in the lead?
[64:20.36]That's the evidence room.
[64:22.36]Where we store items lifted from crime scenes.
[64:25.42]It's kept locked at all times.
[64:27.98]There's things in there that can make people jump through these.
[64:30.18]What time is it right now in the game?
[64:31.70]I have no idea.
[64:35.42]Alright, here we go.
[64:36.68]The way you keep pestering me,
[64:39.97]Lunch.
[64:41.65]It's time to go to lunch.
[64:44.37]Lunch.
[64:44.77]Food.
[64:46.67]Are you hungry?
[64:49.68]Are you hungry?
[64:51.12]Never mind.
[64:52.00]Bye.
[64:54.38]So we gotta come back when it's noon, apparently.
[64:59.42]Save the game.
[65:03.33]Well, that's the guy we gotta give the porn magazine to, so we gotta keep that in mind.
[65:07.81]So, police station, newspaper, we've been everything here.
[65:11.97]TV station.
[65:14.45]Meat plant.
[65:16.85]Oh goodness, this is not good.
[65:18.13]There's a fucking cat over there.
[65:19.31]There's gonna be cat meat in this meat plant, guaranteed.
[65:26.18]A red brick building with a horrible stench coming from it.
[65:31.18]Alright, well, let's see what's inside the meat plant.
[65:33.90]And there's gonna be, there's cats and shit.
[65:39.12]Ugh.
[65:40.15]What the fuck?
[65:41.89]Why?
[65:42.37]Does it have- Why?
[65:45.97]Ayayay.
[65:47.48]There's just a cat.
[65:50.60]Steve.
[65:51.65]How's your father?
[65:52.41]They eat cats here.
[65:53.39]They eat cat meat.
[65:55.76]He's been away from work for weeks.
[65:57.60]And when I call your house, your mother won't let me talk to him.
[66:00.42]I haven't seen him either.
[66:01.26]Isn't this the same actor?
[66:04.14]Though I am glad to see you taking an interest in the business in your dad's absence.
[66:08.36]Who are you?
[66:09.40]Aw, Steve, I didn't want to believe that amnesia hokum.
[66:12.19]Now you're saying you don't remember your pal Pat O'Reilly?
[66:17.37]Alright, what's the family business?
[66:18.29]You may come to realize that this business is not for everybody.
[66:21.35]Just ask your poor, ill dad.
[66:24.50]It takes dedication and a strong stomach.
[66:28.28]What are you looking at?
[66:31.86]A lot of times, when I'm finished scrubbing up and digging the bits of intestine out from my fingernails, I must confess I don't have much appetite for red meat.
[66:40.75]Is cat red meat?
[66:42.39]I don't think cat is even classified as red meat.
[66:44.77]So when you can do this all day and help yourself to a juicy red steak afterwards, then by golly, you can call yourself a butcher.
[66:53.86]Of course, amnesia would certainly help that, wouldn't it?
[67:02.17]Come to think of it, I don't see any cattle around here.
[67:05.11]Where are the cattle?
[67:05.83]Where do you keep the animals?
[67:08.95]Does it matter?
[67:10.29]The end product is all the customer cares about, Steve.
[67:13.69]And we only carry the finest meat.
[67:15.81]Only the juiciest cuts.
[67:20.94]Once you take over the business- If I lose my f- Stop showing me this shit.
[67:25.10]While cutting costs.
[67:26.44]What the fuck?
[67:27.70]They keep cutting to the same image.
[67:29.54]Would the lodge use us to cater their affairs?
[67:32.36]I'm sorry if you're eating right now.
[67:34.02]I'm sure it's good.
[67:34.86]Could I have some meat to take home?
[67:37.15]Your father's very particular about the prophet, Steve.
[67:40.32]No freebies for anyone.
[67:42.46]But seeing how you're his son, if you'll bring written permission from your father, I'll give you the meat.
[67:49.78]Okay.
[67:52.31]What exactly is wrong with you?
[67:53.55]What's wrong with my dad?
[67:54.17]I don't know.
[67:55.33]I can't get in to see him.
[67:58.50]The lodge.
[67:59.04]The order of the Harvest Moon sponsors a weenie roast on the lodge.
[68:02.14]A weenie roast?
[68:03.20]How awesome.
[68:03.98]They tend to get their meat elsewhere the rest of the year.
[68:06.42]You need to get my dad to sign my report card to get cat meat.
[68:08.99]The best way to find out is to sign up with them.
[68:10.81]They're a great organization, Steve.
[68:12.55]They do wonderful work, just like us butchers.
[68:15.59]They do what needs to be done and expect nothing in return.
[68:19.31]Then how do they support themselves?
[68:21.68]Membership dues?
[68:22.78]From what I hear, the work is its own reward.
[68:25.50]This guy doesn't have any teeth.
[68:27.80]Alright, goodbye.
[68:28.44]Don't be such a stranger, Steve.
[68:30.16]And my best to your dad.
[68:31.96]That's fine.
[68:32.62]Can I grab anything?
[68:34.70]From here.
[68:37.18]Can I take one of these cats home and adopt it?
[68:40.41]No.
[68:40.71]Okay, we need permission slip from dad.
[68:44.55]Sheriff has to go on lunch.
[68:47.97]Ay-yi-yi.
[68:49.65]Alright, uh, the Medic Memorial School.
[68:52.02]The school.
[68:53.68]Okay.
[68:55.22]Let's go into the school.
[68:59.22]The bake sale.
[69:00.44]Talk to the principal.
[69:01.00]Steve, good of you to drop by, big guy.
[69:04.24]Haven't seen you since graduation.
[69:06.24]A lot of changes I hear.
[69:07.90]Like I said, again, how old is this character?
[69:10.12]Good, good.
[69:11.22]That's a nice part of my job.
[69:13.04]Turning fine young men and women out into the world.
[69:15.82]And then watching them prosper.
[69:17.94]Of course, I was able to reach more people at the old Sentinel.
[69:20.98]God bless her.
[69:22.36]But then again, I never got to see the results of my work up close before.
[69:26.46]Who are you?
[69:28.37]You know very well I'm Mr. Harold, Principal of Gain Memorial.
[69:32.29]Steve, I've heard about this amnesia nonsense.
[69:35.91]I had hoped you'd be in the lodge by now.
[69:38.61]Fine young fellow like yourself.
[69:41.30]But now, I think maybe you need a little more...
[69:45.85]Quality time.
[69:46.98]Oh, no, no, no.
[69:47.92]Why does everybody... Why is everybody big guy?
[69:51.12]Why do you keep calling me big guy?
[69:53.34]A sign of respect, lad.
[69:55.42]As principal, my station is higher than yours now.
[69:58.27]But you never know what the future holds.
[70:00.59]So you should always hedge your bets.
[70:03.57]And pay tribute to your inferiors.
[70:06.48]You never know who will come to power.
[70:08.30]Everybody's like a sex weirdo in this game, it's true.
[70:12.26]For all I know, you might already be a member of the order with access to the lodge.
[70:17.88]If that were the case, you'd be my superior and I'd be all that much better off having shown you respect and spent some quality time with you.
[70:29.83]What do you mean?
[70:30.85]What are you talking about?
[70:31.93]Quality time.
[70:33.24]Some, like Miss Whaley, favor stern discipline, corporal punishment, as a means of socialization.
[70:41.73]Myself, I temper discipline with love.
[70:47.31]Quality time can be such a warm, sharing experience.
[70:51.81]After just a few sessions, you'd stop this amnesia nonsense and become a productive member of society and a fit candidate for the line.
[71:04.20]Okay, the lodge.
[71:05.56]Quality time.
[71:06.14]Oh, you want some quality time.
[71:08.22]I'm gonna find an adult.
[71:10.06]Okay.
[71:30.27]Drop in again soon.
[71:32.20]Adult education is a wonderful thing.
[71:35.96]As is adult quality time.
[71:39.90]Fucking hell.
[71:41.74]Okay, let's go into the classrooms.
[71:45.45]I'm looking again.
[71:46.23]Drinking fountain?
[71:47.89]Doesn't work.
[71:50.45]Lockers?
[71:52.61]Nope.
[71:55.07]Fire alarm?
[71:59.49]Principal Harold will not let you use the fire alarm.
[72:01.47]Okay.
[72:03.03]Room closet?
[72:06.01]I can go in one of these.
[72:10.86]I just walked into like a kid's classroom.
[72:13.82]And I... The children look stunned and zombified.
[72:20.54]This is like freaking... This is honestly the sound it makes when you press a button accidentally on Windows 98.
[72:25.73]Oh, like Windows XP.
[72:27.23]Okay.
[72:28.55]If you hit like XXX, DUNG DUNG DUNG!
[72:34.00]I don't like where this is going.
[72:36.64]I really don't.
[72:37.40]Oh, yi yi yi.
[72:37.82]Enable sticky keys.
[72:38.92]Then... you remember me?
[73:00.41]Not as such.
[73:01.49]So many pupils, Steven.
[73:02.77]This game is so odd.
[73:04.79]In a very unsettling way.
[73:07.37]You can tell from the forehead.
[73:09.29]The lobes, right class?
[73:11.96]I'm glad you stopped by, Steven.
[73:14.22]Would you care to say a few words to the class about civic responsibility?
[73:18.78]Not really.
[73:20.36]I was just passing through.
[73:22.46]Oh, but you must, Steven.
[73:24.30]A positive role model might be just the thing to inspire these little monsters.
[73:28.00]This game is a fever dream.
[73:28.60]It really is.
[73:29.26]Steven, have you any questions for me?
[73:31.64]Or shall I continue with class?
[73:35.30]Uh, yes, I do.
[73:38.40]Corporal punishment.
[73:39.24]We don't practice corporal punishment here.
[73:41.82]I've never believed in that old adage, spare the rod and spoil the child.
[73:45.78]A rod is too thin.
[73:48.18]But a baseball bat...
[73:50.82]That bridges the generation gap quite nicely.
[73:55.32]Oh dear, Colonel Moreau is conducting another air raid drill.
[73:58.80]Everyone into the hallway, quick!
[74:01.92]Whoa, whoa, what are you doing with that lady?
[74:09.91]You hitting kids with a bat?
[74:12.17]If an A-bomb hits, what good is it gonna do to duck and cover?
[74:15.87]Don't do it.
[74:16.71]Just go.
[74:32.93]My stars that was exciting They had to add like the Tweety bird shit Wow Bye
[75:12.02]Whew!
[75:15.82]Let's go.
[75:19.25]Save the game.
[75:23.03]That was just... So, like, uncanny valley, surreal, weird shit, man.
[75:30.65]Same class.
[75:31.45]Okay.
[75:32.51]Do I have any items?
[75:34.21]She's talking about like a... You wanna use like a shovel?
[75:37.26]Show and tell is next week.
[75:39.06]Alright, whatever.
[75:42.48]Yikes.
[75:42.98]Alright.
[75:43.48]So we got a shovel.
[75:44.30]Do you have like a gun?
[75:47.78]What was that?
[75:50.72]Okay, he just like turned around like this.
[75:52.44]It's like, wait a minute, dude.
[75:53.95]You got like a gun.
[75:54.67]Maybe I should slow down the drinking.
[76:03.11]Exit.
[76:05.01]It's next week, you idiot.
[76:06.67]This is the last place we have not been.
[76:11.21]The TV station.
[76:14.88]Silver Tucker with a yellow interior.
[76:17.92]Tons of people in line.
[76:19.76]Too busy drinking and smoking.
[76:21.00]They ignore you.
[76:22.32]People are waiting for the new iPhone or something.
[76:24.18]Whatever this is.
[76:28.73]Applause.
[76:29.37]Examine the sign.
[76:30.09]A fairly primitive form of mind control.
[76:32.01]Applause.
[76:34.13]okay examine the camera odd no one is operating the camera talk to range rider backdrop a corny western backdrop complete with a cardboard teepee backdrop uh look range rider stay tuned buckaroos there's more to come on range riders cowboy roundup so don't go away
[77:03.71]And what's your name, hombre?
[77:05.69]Steve.
[77:06.41]Steve's a swell name.
[77:08.54]My dog's name is Steve.
[77:09.84]How would he have a cue card already ready to go?
[77:11.08]Would you like my autograph, Steve?
[77:13.70]Sure.
[77:14.78]Here you go, then.
[77:17.35]TV violence.
[77:18.29]Violence?
[77:19.31]What about it?
[77:21.25]Children, watch your show.
[77:22.43]Don't you think this violence is bad for them?
[77:24.75]I love all the blood and gore on your show.
[77:26.69]What red-blooded American doesn't?
[77:29.17]Nothing like an exploding head to get the blood pumping.
[77:32.49]Literally, that is.
[77:34.06]Even so, do you think society pays a heavy price for the violence?
[77:37.60]Here comes the real moral of the story.
[77:38.98]Of course they pay a heavy price.
[77:40.42]Just look at the net profits.
[77:42.06]They'll line up around the block to see a good slaughter.
[77:45.24]Now, excuse me.
[77:46.56]We're going back on the air.
[77:50.33]Alright, children watch your show.
[77:55.71]Don't you think this is bad for them?
[77:57.68]Oh, studies are bullshit, by the way.
[78:17.34]I rip the guts out of godless heathen engines.
[78:20.20]Most kids don't see godless heathen engines on a regular basis.
[78:23.65]And if they do, they better either get their eyes checked or do like old Range Rider and shoot the bejesus out of them.
[78:29.93]Lest they want to go untreated for psychotic hallucinations or wind up with their scalps hanging from a buckskin belt.
[78:36.22]Oh, shit!
[78:37.94]Ow!
[78:38.46]Shit on a stick-a-roo!
[78:44.72]What happened?
[78:45.00]How did that happen?
[78:46.36]The parents that are griping about violence on TV are the same parents that go outside in the morning to fetch their papers.
[78:53.04]That guy stepped in a pile of like shit.
[78:54.48]He was acting like he stepped in shit.
[78:55.70]Yeah, civilization has benefited from violence.
[79:06.00]But should violence be treated as entertainment?
[79:08.80]Check my rating, son.
[79:10.52]Violence is entertainment.
[79:12.82]I just put it on the air.
[79:14.39]If some kid watches, that says something about the kid, not me.
[79:19.85]Now, excuse me.
[79:21.17]We're going back on the air.
[79:25.15]Well, I feel like there's a message in there.
[79:30.27]Can't do anything else in here, I don't think.
[79:31.69]Boom mic?
[79:32.49]Can I grab the mic?
[79:36.44]Seats.
[79:39.02]Okay.
[79:39.40]Well, let's just go then.
[79:42.31]Oh, what?
[79:42.77]No, we're going to like Vince McMahon's backstage.
[79:45.51]W-H-A-R.
[79:46.23]War.
[79:49.79]Hey, sport.
[79:50.71]This is a private office.
[79:52.41]Yeah, I know, Mr... Nice.
[79:55.70]I own and operate this station.
[79:57.60]Have you brought me some news for tonight's broadcast, or... I've lost my memory.
[80:01.96]That's news.
[80:03.24]The hell it is.
[80:03.95]You always were a kidder, Steve.
[80:06.31]Why does everybody say that?
[80:07.61]Real news to tell me?
[80:09.29]Actually, I was just wanting to know more about the TV station.
[80:12.90]Hey, WHAR is the only television station in Harvest.
[80:17.08]Since the old Sentinel went under, what with the newspaper building burning down and all, we're golden.
[80:22.39]Nobody competes with us.
[80:23.33]No competition.
[80:25.13]You and your partners must be rich.
[80:27.23]Partners?
[80:28.33]I run the whole show solo, pal.
[80:30.75]Okay.
[80:31.67]Don't hurry back.
[80:33.00]Now that, I guess that irritated him.
[80:35.40]Oops.
[80:37.60]Can I interest you in Range Rider Autograph?
[80:43.61]Howdy.
[80:45.49]Okay.
[80:47.66]I do have an autograph now.
[80:48.52]Wait a minute.
[80:50.12]Maybe the guy at the post office, uh... Official meat... Under my... Under any circumstances or any... It's not mentioned in this release as recipients for receiving harvest meats.
[81:04.39]Wait a minute.
[81:05.71]Hold on here, guys.
[81:07.24]Pen...
[81:09.21]Ah!
[81:11.70]Come on, I couldn't forge my father's signature?
[81:16.32]Maybe we can get him to talk, though.
[81:20.84]Whatever.
[81:21.12]Let's head back.
[81:38.14]Okay, I do have a... Let's see if I can get him to give me the lodge post office.
[81:44.88]Come on, you're like a big fan of this guy, right?
[81:47.80]He has to be.
[81:49.12]Okay, um... Bye.
[81:55.75]I have an autographed copy of Range Rider.
[81:59.99]You have to think this is cool.
[82:01.59]Shit.
[82:09.38]save it uh oh wait a minute wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait you're right uh the little kid watching TV maybe I can like get him to do something oh he like he's a huge fan he's a huge fan of this TV show look at this look what I got
[82:35.51]You're watching that show, don't you think that guy's fucking cool?
[82:38.95]What?
[82:41.77]What about this?
[82:44.03]Big whoop!
[82:45.25]Big whoop!
[82:47.24]A por- porn magazine is gold!
[82:48.78]Are you serious?
[82:56.02]Shit.
[82:57.20]Um...
[83:07.76]Well, let's see if we can go somewhere else.
[83:13.22]Abandoned house, we have not gone here.
[83:16.80]Car.
[83:19.78]Window, the attic window is the perfect nesting ground for wasps.
[83:22.29]Can I go in?
[83:29.45]Titsuna Crumb, somebody's, okay, hi.
[83:32.57]It's not often that I get visitors.
[83:35.43]I am Tetsua Crumb.
[83:37.45]The ignorant of harvest called me the wasp woman.
[83:40.19]Because my house is covered in bees.
[83:42.82]Apparently.
[83:43.30]I was born of fear and a poverty of imagination.
[83:47.22]I don't understand.
[83:48.98]The politics of honey, the Judeo-Christian rites of sacrifice, and conventional taboos against unbridled pleasure are all responsible for the prejudice against wasps.
[84:04.74]Uh, sacrifice.
[84:06.66]When a bee stings, it rips itself apart and dies for its audacity.
[84:13.39]This appeals to those raised worshipping a god that demands sacrifice and atonement.
[84:22.03]But the wasp is promiscuous.
[84:24.53]Big breathing.
[84:25.45]They are not as sympathetic to the masses.
[84:29.49]Tiny cup.
[84:30.67]Die when they sting.
[84:33.58]They live to sting another day.
[84:37.34]And they take pleasure.
[84:39.22]Shut up.
[84:40.60]Pleasure.
[84:42.26]Yes, a great deal of pleasure.
[84:45.64]The wasp is a sensual being.
[84:47.08]The wasp is a sensual being.
[84:49.56]Not a laborer.
[84:51.17]Hedonistic instead of industrial.
[84:54.43]Some think them quick to anger.
[84:57.05]In truth, they are easily swayed to ecstasy.
[85:01.97]Okay.
[85:02.21]Well, lady, you're fucking creepy.
[85:33.97]I can't hit her.
[85:34.97]I can't get her.
[85:37.43]I tried.
[85:37.93]She was a weird creepy bee lady.
[85:44.63]There's wasps everywhere.
[85:46.55]What's on the counter?
[85:47.13]What's that red thing?
[85:49.03]Picture.
[85:51.97]This is fucking terrifying.
[85:53.39]Okay.
[86:03.88]I can't.
[86:04.44]I can't attack her.
[86:08.48]Anywho.
[86:11.20]So that's it.
[86:12.74]Johnson residence.
[86:14.04]No, that's not it.
[86:14.84]Cemetery.
[86:15.32]There's a lot of places.
[86:16.86]Mortuary.
[86:23.46]Okay.
[86:24.55]Candles.
[86:27.76]These votive candles have been lit by many well-wishers for the dead.
[86:31.12]Or one well-wisher with a lot of matches.
[86:33.41]Okay.
[86:35.47]Those dear to us who have passed recently.
[86:37.23]Jonathan A. Rinecliffe.
[86:38.39]There's that weird symbol.
[86:42.23]Schedule.
[86:43.77]The week's funerals.
[86:46.08]Sofa.
[86:46.50]Let's go in the front door.
[86:53.50]Pews.
[86:55.02]Creepy church.
[86:59.73]A small lectern for a priest.
[87:02.62]A hauntingly beautiful stained glass window in which a man holds a scythe in one hand and some ethereal power in the other.
[87:09.56]Who's in the casket?
[87:11.00]Nobody's in there.
[87:13.64]Candles.
[87:18.24]Nothing.
[87:22.74]I guess I can't do anything here yet.
[87:25.39]We can go in this way.
[87:29.30]Alright, creepy, like, pastor cutting humans up.
[87:32.58]The messy remains of some poor soul.
[87:35.45]Steven.
[87:36.27]Who are you?
[87:37.37]I am Daniel Moynihan.
[87:39.47]Mortician and proprietor of the Wayward Hotel.
[87:42.79]Most people ask me why I don't remember their names.
[87:45.45]Well, you always were a kidder, Steve.
[87:48.85]Besides, as one who deals with the dead, I try not to involve myself in the affairs of the living.
[87:55.48]Your loss of memory is of no concern to me, true or false.
[87:59.21]Ironic, considering my recent involvement.
[88:01.93]What are you talking about?
[88:03.40]My complaints were central to the schedule.
[88:05.66]This guy's like a creepy fucking Abe Lincoln magician.
[88:08.68]I'm gratified the Order of the Harvest Moon got involved.
[88:12.23]The proceeds...
[88:14.12]Okay, um, bake sale.
[88:16.64]This bake sale is a joint effort of the Harvest PTA.
[88:19.70]Parent Teacher Association.
[88:21.12]Yeah, the Parent Teacher Association set up like this human being harvest.
[88:23.92]To set up a fund for transients.
[88:26.53]In other words, bums and societal rejects without families who wander into harvests uninvited.
[88:33.79]Then the order is setting up shelters for the homeless?
[88:37.69]Not shelters.
[88:39.31]Graves.
[88:42.19]you see a great number of these hobos die while passing through now you're calling them hobos don't ask me why it's what those people do use your common sense Steven memory or no if they were involved in setting up homeless shelters then why would I be involved okay uh order of the harvest moon as always the order of the harvest moon has taken the lead in addressing our societal ills through their sponsorship of the blood drive and the bake sale
[89:10.35]The Lodge ensures that all our needs are met.
[89:13.31]Needs.
[89:14.55]Pardon me, there are corpses to prepare.
[89:17.90]And my losses have been substantial of late.
[89:19.88]Stop by the Lodge and seek- I know!
[89:21.10]Why should I be interested?
[89:22.76]Of all the spots in Harvest, the Lodge is the most prominent.
[89:26.70]Literally and figuratively.
[89:29.59]What kind of- Get wisdom.
[89:31.25]If I knew, I'd be a member.
[89:32.55]I have the feeling you have- How do I get this guy to- How do I convince this guy to give me an application?
[89:38.21]We all believe that.
[89:41.53]I don't know.
[89:47.42]How?
[89:48.96]Okay, goodbye.
[89:51.52]He's having a sink.
[89:54.40]A very nasty looking sink.
[89:55.70]A pair of bloody handprints.
[89:59.89]The needle on the line is 33 degrees Fahrenheit.
[90:03.85]That's really cold.
[90:04.65]It's fucking 33 degrees in here?
[90:06.11]Glue.
[90:06.93]Glue.
[90:09.33]A tube of astroglue.
[90:10.21]Something significant.
[90:10.87]Okay, um...
[90:35.58]Do you like porn?
[90:36.96]Why should I care about that?
[90:38.86]Doesn't care about porn.
[90:39.80]What about a shovel?
[90:42.30]Why should I care about that?
[90:43.90]Doesn't need a shovel to bury the corpses.
[90:45.44]What about a signed autograph from Range Rider?
[90:49.10]Why should I care about that?
[90:52.41]What about a permission slip?
[90:54.51]Why should I care about that?
[90:56.45]What about a pen?
[91:00.19]Why should I care about that?
[91:03.13]And finally, what about a fucking old newspaper?
[91:06.01]I don't have anything he wants.
[91:08.30]Okay, let's go back.
[91:19.12]There is only one other place I have not been.
[91:21.58]And it is the cemetery.
[91:23.78]Let's go into the cemetery.
[91:34.62]Uh, examine the tombstones.
[91:35.72]Here lies Boxcar Willy.
[91:38.46]The air here reeks of fresh soil and manure.
[91:42.40]Scotty Baker.
[91:47.84]I got a shovel.
[91:51.36]Whose grave are we digging up?
[91:53.02]Aw man.
[91:54.00]Damn it.
[91:55.15]Damn it.
[91:56.19]Come on.
[91:57.37]Aw man.
[91:58.13]Aw man.
[91:58.83]No way.
[91:59.57]No fucking way.
[92:01.63]Okay.
[92:03.83]Damn it.
[92:05.01]What?
[92:05.65]How is that possible?
[92:07.50]Oh, man.
[92:08.58]Shit.
[92:10.22]That's lame.
[92:10.58]Alright.
[92:11.18]Well, can't dig in a grave.
[92:16.96]That was so obvious.
[92:19.18]The unnamed hobo.
[92:22.78]That didn't work.
[92:24.24]Anything else over here?
[92:26.66]Picnic table.
[92:30.20]Nothing else.
[92:34.40]Doors?
[92:35.70]Is it crypt over here?
[92:37.62]The marble doors have been sealed shut.
[92:45.85]Damn it.
[92:46.35]I thought we had fucking progress there.
[92:49.41]Unfortunate.
[92:53.98]Well, um... Where to now?
[93:01.40]Do we go to the... We didn't go to the diner.
[93:03.90]This is the last possible place.
[93:07.72]1955, frag 100 with real leather seat.
[93:13.69]24-hour diner.
[93:21.29]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[93:23.03]Sheriff's here.
[93:29.71]Take it.
[93:33.57]See what he says?
[93:35.99]Oh, bye, George.
[93:39.67]Oh, bye, Jiminy.
[93:41.56]Here's the real thing.
[93:45.00]Oh, can I have it?
[93:47.86]What are you going to give me?
[93:48.99]Sure.
[93:51.95]Oh, thank you, Steve.
[93:54.90]Excuse me, kiddo.
[93:57.60]I gotta go check the jail for clean tiles.
[94:05.12]Don't show him masturbating, please.
[94:07.48]Don't do it.
[94:11.47]Thank God.
[94:11.85]Okay, what's on the desk?
[94:13.87]The drawer's unlocked.
[94:15.09]Go!
[94:17.71]What do we got?
[94:18.39]A note.
[94:18.97]A barely legible note.
[94:21.09]Take it.
[94:21.85]What else is in here?
[94:22.57]A key.
[94:23.65]Key to the evidence room.
[94:24.79]Got it.
[94:26.39]And a checkbook.
[94:27.81]Sheriff Dwayne's checkbook.
[94:29.51]Got it.
[94:31.51]Progress.
[94:34.36]Progress, finally.
[94:38.88]So.
[94:42.42]This is the evidence room, right?
[94:46.07]Let's use the key on the evidence room.
[94:53.71]Alright, some weird, like, doll.
[94:55.55]Uh, Santa hats?
[94:56.86]Dart boards?
[94:58.92]Ay-yi-yi.
[94:59.88]Examine the shelf.
[95:00.76]A little... A nifty little evidence shelf.
[95:03.84]Toast?
[95:05.96]Somebody killed somebody with a piece of toast.
[95:07.86]Padlock.
[95:11.32]Cabinets are empty.
[95:13.40]Cabinets are empty.
[95:14.68]Unsolved cases...
[95:17.83]Fire hydrant prop.
[95:19.19]Painting.
[95:21.47]Doll.
[95:23.79]Tainted evidence.
[95:24.57]This guy... Okay.
[95:25.59]Don't need to even read the rest of that.
[95:27.47]Don't open the refrigerator.
[95:28.77]Dart board.
[95:31.63]Santa hat.
[95:34.66]Gas can.
[95:36.10]It's empty.
[95:38.18]Use gas can on the... No, no.
[95:39.74]Put it away.
[95:40.22]I got a gas can now.
[95:42.00]Lawn dart.

[95:55.91]Shaving kit.
[95:58.59]A lot of new items.
[96:01.27]Beer.
[96:02.55]Binoculars.
[96:05.77]I think that's it.
[96:08.05]I'm good to go, I think.
[96:08.81]Bottle.
[96:09.73]Yeah.
[96:10.77]Got it.
[96:13.52]Save the game.
[96:20.99]Don't over... Wait, don't... What do you mean don't override saves?
[96:23.15]Why not?
[96:23.31]What are you talking about?
[96:24.29]Don't override saves?
[96:25.59]Why?
[96:29.02]What's the... You don't want to override a save.
[96:33.58]Well, apparently I can't... I can't save it anyways.
[96:38.38]Okay, whatever.
[96:39.48]New saves.
[96:40.22]What?
[96:42.79]Rotate saves?
[96:44.23]Why?
[96:44.43]Okay.
[96:45.62]Make new save slot?
[96:46.88]Why do I need to make new save slots?
[97:00.34]Hello, Steve.
[97:01.72]Where's Loomis?
[97:03.32]He'll be coming around the mountain if he comes.
[97:07.76]Oh, that's good.
[97:11.14]Loomis, stab you!
[97:13.63]He just howled like a dog.
[97:30.12]He's like Wolf Howl.
[97:33.66]What?
[97:35.16]Coffee pot.
[97:36.70]Anything else?
[97:38.30]Damn it, Loomis.
[97:41.44]Can I open this one too?
[97:44.55]I can't.
[97:46.70]Note.
[97:47.48]Sheriff, if you think I'm going to leap paying this forever, you are crazy.
[97:54.54]I can't read this chicken scratch nonsense.
[98:02.93]Nothing else I can do.
[98:05.21]I don't think so, at least.
[98:05.93]Let me make sure.
[98:07.73]I got sneakers.
[98:08.23]I got a gas can.
[98:08.77]Alright, we gotta give the sneakers to that kid.
[98:10.91]Where did that kid go?
[98:15.11]Nothing else.
[98:15.83]Yeah, let's get out of here.
[98:19.59]Uh, traffic cop, that's fine.
[98:24.25]That was not that hard to read.
[98:25.42]Yeah, it was!
[98:26.88]That was... Excuse me!
[98:29.76]Excuse me!
[98:30.40]That was difficult to read.
[98:34.68]Okay, this is the other residence.
[98:43.50]The glass is so clear, the reflection makes it difficult to see.
[98:45.60]Let's check this neighbor's house.
[98:48.42]Okay, we got like a fat guy.
[98:51.80]Perfect, okay.
[98:52.82]I think this is my wife's house, right?
[98:56.64]Squeezing meat.
[98:58.72]Talk to Mr. Potsdam.
[99:00.07]There he is, my future son-in-law.
[99:02.59]And how's he doing today?
[99:04.29]What brings him to the Potsdam household?
[99:06.45]Huh?
[99:07.09]Huh?
[99:09.34]I've lost my memory.
[99:10.88]What a card.
[99:12.52]Would I kid about something like that?
[99:14.48]Why won't you believe me?
[99:16.20]Well, you always were a kidder, Steve.
[99:18.80]That has to mean something.
[99:19.60]Imagination's a swell thing to have, in small amounts.
[99:23.24]Man needs to keep his feet on the ground, especially if he's getting married.
[99:28.10]Tell me, is your father feeling better?
[99:31.28]Is he going back to the slaughterhouse anytime soon?
[99:36.44]I can't imagine a better job than working in a slaughterhouse.
[99:41.94]I don't want to work in a filthy slaughterhouse.
[99:45.22]I think working in a slaughterhouse might be cool.
[99:47.04]Sure, it'd be just dandy.
[99:49.30]And you can't argue with success.
[99:51.50]Everyone in Harvest gets their meat from your dad.
[99:56.13]What a grand business to go in.
[99:58.33]Oh, God, he's in the chat.
[99:59.77]Who's in the chat?
[100:00.45]Oh, sure.
[100:01.21]Cutting animals open may not be much fun.
[100:04.03]Reaching into their bodies and yanking out the bloody guts, intestines dangling and slapping against you.
[100:11.12]The smell of death and shit in your nostrils all the time.
[100:14.66]Well, those are all definite cons of what you've done.
[100:21.02]The guts.
[100:21.64]What the fuck was that?
[100:22.74]What are you left with?
[100:27.77]I was, like, barely paying attention.
[100:29.55]Okay.
[100:39.06]Ah, see, you fucked with your wood.
[100:43.10]You gotta use coasters, man.
[100:44.52]Let me break.
[100:47.98]Is this Stephanie?
[100:49.02]No.
[100:52.00]Cabinets.
[100:54.37]Talk to Mrs. Potsdam.
[100:56.25]It's just your mother with a wig on.
[100:58.51]You look just like my mom.
[100:59.83]See?
[100:59.93]That's what I'm saying.
[101:01.11]You look just like my mom.
[101:02.03]So bizarre.
[101:16.92]There's nothing bizarre about baking cookies.
[101:19.78]The Harvest Charity Bake Sale is Friday, you know.
[101:21.73]The Harvest Charity Bake Sale?
[101:23.67]Mrs. Marvin Potsden Jr.
[101:24.93]can be counted on to do her share.
[101:29.75]What about your pearls?
[101:30.57]Just because I'm doing housework doesn't mean I have to be a drudge.
[101:33.47]It's the right thing to look good for her husband at all times.
[101:37.45]What's wrong with wearing pearls, for heaven's sake?
[101:40.57]Nothing, but you look like June Cleaver.
[101:43.23]You're next to the beach?
[101:44.03]I'm the sitcom mom.
[101:46.07]All I can hear waves crashing into my house I'm much too busy with housework to watch TV.
[101:56.87]Maybe Mr.. Poston would know about sitcom Stephanie doesn't watch TV though Alright, well she's grounded Mr.. Poston feels there's too much at stake to allow Stephanie to run around loose She doesn't want to get married either, huh?
[102:12.82]Are you saying you don't want to marry my daughter?
[102:15.98]I don't know your daughter, Mrs. Potsdam.
[102:18.54]Why is she grounded?
[102:19.82]Afraid she'll run away before the wedding?
[102:22.57]No.
[102:23.63]She's as delighted as we are about the wedding.
[102:25.71]Every bit as delighted as we are.
[102:26.65]We all love the beach.
[102:27.89]But she might get hit by a car or a boat.
[102:29.65]Ham radio.
[102:30.75]Hey, guys.
[102:32.31]And up next is we're going to play Nirvana Smells Like Teen Spirit again.
[102:38.31]We've played this song five times in the last four hours.
[102:42.81]Can I see Stephanie?
[102:43.85]I don't see any reason why not.
[102:46.71]Alright, thanks.
[102:47.63]Give my regards to your parents.
[102:52.60]So where's Stephanie?
[102:59.46]Uh, one of these is Stephanie's room.
[103:06.83]There's my wife, Stephanie!
[103:13.07]Who are you?
[103:14.85]What are you doing in my room?
[103:16.61]Haven't you heard?
[103:17.69]We're getting married.
[103:19.37]So, you're the one.
[103:21.15]So we both have amnesia.
[103:23.15]You mean, you don't know me?
[103:26.19]I mean, I don't know anyone.
[103:28.37]I don't remember anything.
[103:29.47]How many times do I have to say it?
[103:31.51]Just one, Stephanie, because I can't remember a damn thing either.
[103:35.66]Really?
[103:37.50]Oh God, I thought it was just me.
[103:39.48]You're not alone.
[103:41.40]Can you tell me what's going on here?
[103:43.58]Those people downstairs have locked me in my room.
[103:46.93]They say I'm grounded until the wedding.
[103:50.81]Those people.
[103:51.87]They claim to be my parents.
[103:54.35]I can't dispute it because I can't remember for sure one way or the other, but... Aliens.
[103:58.71]It doesn't feel right.
[104:02.21]I got here just in time for the sex scene.
[104:04.68]No, you didn't.
[104:05.56]This is, it's not gonna happen.
[104:08.44]I know what you mean, I don't belong here.
[104:09.68]No one will ever believe that we have got amnesia.
[104:11.71]I don't belong here.
[104:12.89]Do you have any idea where you do belong?
[104:15.75]No, but I'm fairly sure I don't belong in Harvest.
[104:19.63]Yeah.
[104:21.19]I can't remember anything, but I feel in my heart that the woman downstairs is not my mother.
[104:28.19]She's like this thing.
[104:29.55]Like a parody.
[104:30.61]Like a parody.
[104:31.99]A bad joke with mother as the punchline.
[104:34.27]Mm-hmm.
[104:36.23]You know, it kinda does.
[104:36.99]Yeah, believe me, I understand.
[104:38.73]Am I getting played here?
[104:39.55]We're both grounded.
[104:40.91]Yes, we are.
[104:41.29]Okay.
[105:09.81]You're not making sense You're not making sense You're not making sense You're not making sense
[105:39.71]You're not making sense.
[105:43.61]Let's escape.
[105:44.41]Escape?
[105:45.57]Harvest is a prison, Steve.
[105:47.63]Don't forget that.
[105:50.64]That's too harsh.
[105:51.20]These people are just eccentric.
[105:52.24]Yeah, I think you're right.
[105:52.84]Of course I'm right.
[105:55.16]Try band.
[105:56.50]Hey.
[106:00.20]You're not make... Alright, let's go.
[106:02.88]Come back and visit me.
[106:04.60]Can I give her something?

[106:09.29]Hey, you like gasoline?
[106:10.21]Let's huff it together.
[106:11.39]Are you making some... Don't.
[106:15.22]Don't.
[106:15.62]I'm kidding.
[106:16.98]Would you like an autograph from your favorite TV superstar?
[106:19.06]Are you making some... Okay.
[106:25.00]Okay.
[106:25.78]Okay.

[107:29.67]Cold medicine.
[107:30.87]Geez, I'm like raiding their entire fucking cabinet.

[109:19.34]It's okay.
[109:22.14]She's putting clothes on.
[109:25.42]We're fine.
[109:28.58]She was just getting dressed.
[109:32.26]Is that right?
[109:34.74]Aye, aye, aye.
[109:36.60]No, don't look at it again.
[109:40.78]Reverse band.
[109:42.96]Alright, we have a lot of items now.
[109:47.10]If it isn't my favorite son-in-law.

[109:56.88]Alright.
[110:00.18]Let's get out of here.
[110:03.36]Let's exit.
[110:04.04]No, I want to go down the stairs, man.
[110:09.66]That guy really does look like an egg.
[110:14.41]Alright, I have, let's go to the post office.
[110:18.63]I have a bunch of items now I can do.
[110:23.17]Sorry, son.
[110:24.15]Sorry, son.
[110:24.77]That's right.
[110:25.31]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[110:26.12]Next time.
[110:28.12]I have tampons for you.
[110:31.12]That interests me.
[110:31.97]That's not... I'm not... I'm kidding.
[110:33.41]I have a note that... That you wrote.
[110:37.59]Sheriff, if you think... I can't read this.
[110:41.39]Cave paying... Just give it to him and see what he says.
[110:46.88]You wrote this note.
[110:48.28]What does this mean?
[110:50.36]I know why the sheriff is blackmailing you.
[110:53.20]Hmm.
[110:54.11]This is unexpected and awkward.
[110:57.85]But my luck's been bad ever since Dwayne found that darn gas can at the newspaper building the day after the fire.
[111:03.13]I got that.
[111:03.69]He has this insane notion that it's mine.
[111:05.86]Me.
[111:06.90]I pay him, not because I'm guilty, but because I don't want him slurring my good name around Harvest.
[111:12.06]True.
[111:12.18]Oh, naturally.
[111:12.92]Mm-hmm.
[111:13.84]You know, he keeps that gas can in the evidence room at his office.
[111:18.64]I'd be really grateful to whoever could fetch me that can.
[111:21.38]I already have it.
[111:22.61]Grateful enough to provide him with a lodge application.
[111:25.91]There it is.
[111:26.61]Oh, and Steve...
[111:28.87]You'll keep this to yourself.
[111:31.35]If you're smart.
[111:33.25]Uh, yes.
[111:34.31]I have the gas can right here.
[111:36.76]Oh my god.
[111:37.86]I can't believe it.
[111:39.06]After all this time.
[111:40.08]Progress.
[111:40.68]Where's my application, Boyle?
[111:43.12]Here, take it.
[111:44.40]With my thanks.
[111:47.06]You know, this morning as I was making my rounds, I noticed an awful lot of television aerials on the roofs.
[111:55.05]Seems like more and more each day.
[111:56.93]He's in the middle of a sneeze.
[111:58.43]He's about to sneeze.
[111:59.63]That is one or two seconds before a sneeze.
[112:03.63]What do you mean?
[112:05.26]There's another reason why Sheriff Dwayne didn't investigate the Sentinel fire.
[112:09.78]If you'd like to get something else on the blackmailing bastard, check around the television station.
[112:15.00]Why are you still canned?
[112:16.08]TV station.
[112:17.70]Alright, did I get my application?
[112:19.46]There it is.
[112:22.23]Uh, first name... We gotta fill this in, so I'm gonna assume the pen must have to... The pen has to come in handy here.
[112:28.09]That's a ticket.
[112:28.97]There it is.
[112:31.55]Uh, how often do you want to, uh... You said three times a day.
[112:35.41]First name, Steve.
[112:36.83]Middle name.
[112:37.81]I don't know.
[112:38.13]Nobody will tell me any of these things.
[112:39.59]I don't know what my street is.
[112:40.95]I know I live in Harvest.
[112:42.61]Do you have any physical disabilities that prevent you from... Sad... Lettuce...
[112:52.78]Yeah, no.
[112:53.92]Do you use a triangle?
[112:55.64]No.
[112:56.64]Do you enjoy the circle of banjo waiting?
[113:01.22]Yes.
[113:02.12]Can you climb a rappel?
[113:04.72]Yes.
[113:05.60]Are you... Where do we look at the following?
[113:10.37]I have a... I can't read that.
[113:13.19]I don't know.
[113:13.97]Have you had any Prometheus?
[113:17.43]No.
[113:18.11]I don't even know what that is.
[113:19.36]See, neither do I. In 50 words or less, tell me how you would benefit the cult.
[113:25.12]I feel I am helped by a hero worker and especially seasoning to think I'd ghost for the lodge.
[113:35.01]I'm not good.
[113:35.87]I may...
[113:41.16]that means hey ma'am ma'am excuse me ma'am you think you need a couple of tampons didn't work well that didn't work alright let's go to the lodge I got what I needed let's go to the lodge and present our application what do you say save it first

[115:00.81]Somebody's looking- I gotta be careful here.
[115:06.35]Who's peeking through the wall to see in the bathroom me changing?
[115:18.52]What the fuck is going on?

[116:03.90]It is now Tuesday.
[116:11.43]Any new dialog?
[116:13.09]What?
[116:15.08]Who are you?
[116:15.54]Leave me alone, Steve, or I'll tell Mama.
[116:17.48]Wait, I wake up every day and I don't know my, I don't have memory?
[116:24.13]So this is just fucking Groundhog Day, and I don't remember anything.
[116:27.53]Here are your sneakers, you little shit.
[116:30.43]Hey, did you ever find any sneakers?
[116:33.44]Yes, I did.
[116:34.24]Whoa, that's great.
[116:35.64]Maybe we could... What could you give me?
[116:37.16]Yeah, what can you give me?
[116:38.14]You know Miss Whaley and Principal Harold down at the school?
[116:41.32]Well, I found out they're messing around with each other in the broom closet.
[116:45.62]I can tell you when they meet and trade you some keys that'll let you catch them.
[116:50.09]Alright.
[116:50.83]Okay, take the sneakers.
[116:52.77]Swell!
[116:53.95]Here's the keys to the broom closet at Gingham Ward.
[116:56.81]345.
[116:56.85]That's where they meet every day.
[116:58.29]About 345.
[116:58.97]As soon as everyone has gone home.
[117:01.53]Sometimes I hide in there beforehand.
[117:03.69]Daddy-o, I see some stuff that's real nasty.
[117:06.53]Jesus Christ.
[117:07.33]Take it from me.
[117:08.22]You made a good swap.
[117:09.44]See you later, alligator.
[117:12.20]Thanks for the swap.
[117:13.18]So now I have the key to the broom closet.
[117:14.94]I need to go there at 345.
[117:15.78]To watch the principal and the secretary have sex.
[117:22.02]Dammit, what's so hard about remembering to take out the paper?
[117:24.90]You need to wise up, pal, before I get mad.
[117:29.86]Take out the paper.
[117:31.37]Shut up.
[117:33.23]Alright, let's go spy on two people making out a broom closet, I guess.
[117:42.15]Daddy-o!
[117:44.29]Where's the school?
[117:45.25]The hotel?
[117:45.65]I didn't go to the hotel yet.
[117:48.37]Let's go to the school first.
[117:49.25]Where's the school?
[117:53.15]School.
[118:07.43]Okay.
[118:08.93]We're looking for a locked door.
[118:11.73]Room closet.
[118:12.65]The door is locked.
[118:14.81]Here's the key.
[118:15.99]Let's see what happens.
[118:16.53]Well, that didn't work.
[118:17.99]Well, that didn't work.
[118:20.31]That's apparently not correct.
[118:22.40]Room closet key.
[118:25.88]Why does it not work?
[118:29.70]Are the kids still here?
[118:30.84]Are there people still here?
[118:34.86]Room closet.
[118:38.58]Broom closet key.
[118:41.10]Use broom closet key on broom closet.
[118:43.54]Well, that didn't work.
[118:46.56]Okay, well, I guess we can't be here yet.
[118:50.31]What time is it?
[118:50.83]And what if I get to see the clock?
[118:56.93]Is there a clock that I can pay attention to?
[119:01.03]Wait till 340.
[119:01.65]Where do you see the time?
[119:04.42]I don't see time anywhere.
[119:08.96]This is the wayward hotel.
[119:10.45]I've not been here yet.
[119:12.71]Let's just go right in.
[119:19.53]There's this guy.
[119:23.55]Weird picture up there.
[119:24.37]Alright, examine the ledger.
[119:26.61]The last being Jonathan A. Ryancliffe checked in Monday.
[119:29.17]And that guy's dead.
[119:30.69]So we're going to take that.
[119:31.45]Let's go talk to this guy again.
[119:33.51]We really have nothing to say to each other.
[119:37.37]I have the feeling your innards shall soon adorn my slab, and I'd rather not know the face of the meat I'm slicing.
[119:46.91]I'd say it's been a pleasure, but I finally- What do I got?
[119:53.41]Vitamins, cough medicine, tampons, Hoarah Loux, hotel ledger.
[120:00.95]Why should I care about- You should care about that because you're the guy that runs the hotel!
[120:09.80]This is the note.
[120:12.17]I still have it.
[120:13.27]Okay.
[120:17.37]Smash him in the face with a shovel.
[120:18.85]I would love to.
[120:20.97]Why should I?
[120:22.83]Exam the door.
[120:23.61]The door is locked.
[120:24.31]There's nothing else I can do.
[120:30.44]Mirror?
[120:32.58]No.
[120:34.48]Flyer?
[120:35.40]PTA bake sales on Friday.
[120:40.58]I did not read the ledger yet.
[120:41.92]Can I even read the ledger?
[120:44.51]Where is the ledger?
[120:46.25]I cannot read it.
[120:47.43]It's just a... It's like a... It's like a piece of metal.
[120:51.93]Hmm, hmm, hmm.
[120:52.81]Okay.
[120:55.05]Uh, fire station.
[120:55.87]There's more naked guys.
[121:01.52]Alright, uh...
[121:03.57]Hello, Steve.
[121:05.11]Still sketching the same nude man?
[121:07.05]It doesn't behoove one to be fickle.
[121:08.91]These guys are painting.
[121:10.74]Once you find a perfect model... You can equip items as weapons?
[121:16.52]Bye-bye.
[121:18.08]Here, how about this?
[121:19.16]What if I give these guys the camera?
[121:22.82]I don't converse.
[121:25.83]Instead of painting this guy, do you want to take real photos?
[121:28.87]What's that got to do with... Really?
[121:40.21]Well, he did say to go check out the TV station.
[121:42.93]That is true.
[121:45.97]Let's go do that.
[121:49.57]TV station.
[121:56.92]Okay, he can't talk.
[121:57.92]We're on set.
[121:59.28]Goodbye.
[122:01.04]So, the back room.
[122:02.56]Is this guy still here?
[122:06.62]This guy's still hanging out here.
[122:07.70]So, how do I get him to leave?
[122:10.68]Operate the picture.
[122:12.12]Enter the wall safe.
[122:14.02]Mr. McKnight's secret safe requires a number combination before it can be accessed.
[122:17.98]If you don't get out of here right now, I'm having you arrested for trespassing.
[122:22.63]Don't hurry back.
[122:25.63]Can I fucking kill this guy?
[122:29.73]What makes you think I give a shit?
[122:32.89]Give the camera to the dog.

[123:55.79]It's like cartoon music in the background.
[124:01.32]04-23-71-58.
[124:02.56]I didn't do that.
[124:06.46]I didn't do the rest of that.
[124:07.94]I did not do the rest of that.
[124:12.36]I have the combination.
[124:15.11]In the time it took me to come out of the menu, I cut the guy's head off?
[124:21.18]Okay, open the safe.
[124:23.07]What's in here?
[124:25.43]Deed.

[124:46.54]Can I write my name in there?
[124:50.90]I wonder if I can just pen my name in.
[124:55.81]No.
[124:56.03]I can't write on the deed.
[125:03.99]Okay, so am I going to get, like, arrested for this?
[125:05.55]Should I give him the deed?
[125:16.50]Okay.
[125:21.56]Who do I give the deed to?
[125:22.58]Let me read this again.
[125:31.25]Lance McKnight.
[125:32.99]Lance McKnight is the sheriff.
[125:39.59]Well, I have this.
[125:40.23]Should I give it to Boyle?
[125:46.79]Yeah, I'm going to go give this to the post office guy.
[125:49.45]That makes the most sense to me.
[125:56.62]I just killed McKnight.
[125:57.82]Oh, whoops.
[125:58.82]Well, whatever.
[126:01.16]Post office.
[126:04.43]Dwayne is the sheriff.
[126:05.41]Okay, so let's go.
[126:06.21]Let's do this.
[126:07.91]I just killed the sheriff?
[126:08.83]That wasn't the sheriff.
[126:09.37]That was a TV executive.
[126:12.37]Save this game.
[126:12.95]Okay, this one's called I Killed TV Guy.
[126:23.92]Just so we're aware of where we are.
[126:26.96]Here's this deed.
[126:27.64]No, look out of the way.
[126:31.30]Blind lady is gone.
[126:33.51]That does not interest him.
[126:42.31]I guess he doesn't care about that.
[126:44.91]Room closet time?
[126:51.34]The run is over.
[126:52.14]Why?
[126:52.50]What?

[131:40.09]Yeah, and don't forget about the sheriff.
[131:42.19]Dwayne is a blackmailer after all.
[131:44.81]Oh, yeah.
[131:47.13]Sorry, I decided not to run with this story.
[131:50.97]What?
[131:51.95]But this is all the evidence you need for your newscast.
[131:54.73]Evidence of a blackmail situation.

[131:59.48]Sorry, sport.
[132:00.78]No can do.

[132:08.40]I know, I know.
[132:09.26]It may cause you some problems, but hey, let's do lunch, okay?

[132:55.27]Should I... Okay, well, I have to... You know, I don't even... Like, we... Whatever.
[133:14.67]Should I not have done that again?
[133:15.75]The bourbon?
[133:18.63]Bourbon's really good.
[133:19.81]It's fantastic.
[133:23.46]Is there a... I thought everyone was saying to do it.
[133:32.93]Okay, I'm like walking around with a shovel still.

[134:19.02]I ain't fucking with this guy again.
[134:21.38]Not a chance.
[134:23.70]The school is where I need to go, but I can't- He says he's motioning me away from the door.
[134:30.59]Door's locked.
[134:41.69]Caught you!
[134:42.70]Red-handed!
[134:45.56]Apparently they don't- they're not gonna stop.
[134:58.21]Okay.

[136:14.16]More than that you won't get.
[136:15.92]We don't have much money.
[136:17.09]We're educators, not janitors.
[136:19.51]Now, will you take the bat or not?
[136:24.53]I already have a shovel.
[136:25.51]A shovel is better than a bat as a melee weapon.
[136:27.29]Why would I care?
[136:32.03]No.
[136:32.65]No way.
[136:33.25]I got dirt on you two.
[136:35.35]So why would I do that?
[136:40.39]You can kill somebody way easier with a shovel than a bat.
[136:46.74]No.
[136:47.08]Then you damn well better keep your mouth shut about this.
[136:50.82]Please?
[136:51.62]He'll keep his mouth shut if he knows what's good for him.
[137:14.87]Alright, we're going to take the bat.
[137:17.58]Come on.
[137:23.86]Oh no, something fucked up here.

[138:05.69]There we go.
[138:06.85]You're busted.
[138:09.91]Blackmailing you.
[138:10.87]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[138:11.73]I think the photo's worth... Alright, maybe I should... Maybe I could use a good solid bat.
[138:16.18]Take the bat, and we'll take the photo.
[138:18.46]Wait, they take the photo, though.
[138:19.26]How ever will I keep the children in line now?
[138:22.18]I have a spare I can bring in tomorrow, unless you prefer a chainsaw this time.

[140:03.10]Yeah, I know.
[140:06.33]We already saw this.
[140:07.09]I said the word fuck and I got a great, great potential outcome here.

[140:52.51]I can't swing the bat at mom's head.
[140:54.07]Sorry, guys.
[140:55.61]I know you're disappointed.
[140:56.39]Oh, you know what?
[141:02.45]Wait, wait, wait.
[141:02.99]The trash cookies.
[141:03.65]You're right.
[141:04.44]Can I take a cookie out of the trash?
[141:07.84]No.
[141:08.98]Can't go in the oven, can't touch these things.
[141:10.92]Okay, that's fine, whatever.
[141:15.56]What the fuck?
[141:24.75]Okay, uh... That's a weird looking television.
[141:32.26]Come to think of it, this whole place looks totally retro.
[141:35.00]So we were abducted by aliens.
[142:00.71]It means... Oh man, I know what I mean.
[142:04.59]That everything here is wrong.
[142:06.32]But I can't picture the difference.
[142:08.62]Then shut up and quit bugging me.
[142:11.32]I'm watching my terrible-
[142:13.97]Have you noticed that your show isn't black and white?
[142:16.43]What else?
[142:17.45]Well, I... He doesn't know.
[142:18.87]So, I'm from the 90s, and I'm back in the... I'm back in the 50s, and it's a time travel.
[142:25.62]Aliens suck me up into a ship and put me down here, and I'm supposed to kill everybody.
[142:30.46]It's a test to see what humans will do if they put me in a situation like this.
[142:38.62]Little kids shouldn't watch violence.
[142:40.21]So, let me alone.
[142:43.68]Actually, let me say yes, you're allowed.
[142:46.18]You're right, that is neat.
[142:48.18]God.
[142:48.58]Alright.
[142:48.94]Goodbye.
[142:49.72]Alright, we've watched the same guy get shot in the chest like five times.

[146:45.62]Okay, so there are consequences for killing people.
[146:48.86]Good to know.
[146:49.24]Well, how come I didn't get in trouble for killing the TV executive?
[146:55.06]I slit the TV executive's head off his shoulders.
[147:00.28]And I didn't get in trouble at all.
[147:01.66]Zero.
[147:02.00]Let me go back to the house.

[151:28.51]When can I get... What is it?
[151:29.47]Nighttime.
[151:33.03]How do you determine if it becomes night and day, you know?
[151:37.70]It's not nighttime yet?
[151:40.04]Sorry, Steve.
[151:41.30]Too tired to talk right now.
[151:43.86]I just gave the... I don't... Well, how do I progress time?
[152:04.40]Is it just random?
[152:07.04]Like, the time just progresses as you play?
[152:09.16]Just by doing things?
[152:15.08]This is the burnt-down newspaper building.
[152:16.64]I can't do anything here.
[152:25.86]What about the police station?
[152:28.71]I feel like I haven't talked to the sheriff in a long time.
[152:30.49]Or the meat plant.
[152:39.27]The diner.
[152:40.75]I actually did not even go in here.
[152:42.26]I freaked out because I saw the sheriff in here that one time.
[152:44.34]Alright.
[152:45.46]We've got some stuff to do in here.
[152:48.19]Hello there, Steve.
[152:49.47]Here for lunch?
[152:50.93]No, just here looking around.
[152:53.07]Though I'm not entirely sure where here is.
[152:57.43]Oh, I forgot.
[152:58.51]You're playing your little amnesia prank.
[153:01.36]Well, boy, this is DNA's diner.
[153:05.20]DNA?
[153:06.66]Don't listen to Sheriff Dwayne.
[153:08.32]This is Edna's diner.
[153:09.98]But ever since the E burned out on the sign, they've been giving me a hard time.
[153:14.09]Now don't be like that, Edna.
[153:16.23]It's a great place to eat, which is good, since it's the only place to eat in Hartman.
[153:20.98]Smash him with a bat?
[153:22.10]I understand you witnessed Ms.
[153:23.50]Welles dispatching a little discipline at the school.
[153:26.88]And she thinks you may be feeling a mite bent about it.
[153:30.66]That insane woman cripples children.
[153:37.95]I feel like we need to play it cool here.
[153:41.67]That's always the wisest course, boy.
[153:45.02]Sticking your nose where it doesn't belong can get you in a world of trouble.
[153:50.38]Especially if you're a gynecologist.
[153:54.68]Who says that in a conversation?
[153:56.34]Like, oh, yeah, he's sticking his nose around your vaginas.
[154:00.07]Like, what?
[154:00.97]We didn't even go there.
[154:01.91]You went there for no reason.
[154:04.15]It's bigger than all of us.
[154:06.71]You've been shooting off your mouth about me and Boyle, Steve.
[154:10.75]Oh.
[154:13.16]Alright, what do we got?
[154:15.18]We got this thing.
[154:16.44]The Deed.
[154:16.90]What do you think about this, Sheriff?
[154:20.54]Oh, shit.
[154:20.91]Uh, yeah, I offed him alright.
[154:23.99]Nah, a nice fairy left it under my pillow.
[154:25.23]Yeah.
[154:40.35]I killed him.
[154:40.97]No big loss.
[154:42.03]What do you gotta say?
[154:42.61]It just means I don't have to split the profits with him anymore.
[154:46.73]You're probably thinking this is evidence of my negligence.
[154:50.63]My failure to properly investigate the newspaper fire.
[154:54.23]It is?
[154:55.37]Maybe even complicity.
[154:57.41]Since the newspaper and the TV station were rivals.
[155:00.85]Sure.
[155:02.27]Uh... Hmm.
[155:07.55]The idea never crossed my mind.
[155:10.26]Something like that.
[155:16.56]I feel like the correct answer for the game is two.
[155:19.48]But one is a proper answer.
[155:22.41]I'm going to say two.
[155:31.01]That never crossed my mind.
[155:32.49]Well, I'm glad to hear it.
[155:34.49]In that case, you'll return my property, right?
[155:39.75]This has got to be worth a lot to you, Sheriff.
[155:42.84]You're welcome to have this evidence with my compliments.
[155:45.18]It's got to be worth a lot.
[155:46.10]Steve, when you blackmail someone, you never bring the originals along.
[155:52.37]If you do, your target can take them away.
[155:55.97]And then where are you?
[155:57.91]I made copies.
[155:59.41]Lies.
[155:59.71]I doubt it.
[156:00.17]Good.
[156:00.65]Lies.
[156:01.09]Or you'd have brought them along.
[156:03.76]No, Steve.
[156:04.60]I got a shovel.
[156:05.82]I think I'll just have to take that risk.
[156:07.60]That's fine.
[156:07.92]I got a shovel.
[156:08.24]Fuck you, buddy.
[156:08.88]Let's... What?
[156:11.52]Hey!
[156:11.96]Somebody help me!
[156:12.99]Why?
[156:13.47]What?
[156:16.55]What do you people want from me?
[156:19.61]Too late for that, boy.
[156:21.50]I...
[156:31.31]Well, we didn't do it correctly.
[156:33.14]Don't say you don't blackmail them.
[156:37.82]God damn it.
[156:41.74]Speaking of diner, I'm getting, like, hungry.
[156:48.50]You have to make copies of the deed.
[156:52.23]Where's the copy machine?
[156:55.09]Make copies?
[156:55.87]Wow!
[156:56.59]The general store?
[156:58.41]Doesn't this cost money?
[157:02.83]Copy you.
[157:03.67]Free cop- FREE copies!
[157:05.23]You got it.
[157:05.65]Eat shit, buddy.
[157:11.35]Free copies.
[157:16.62]Photocopy of the TV deed.
[157:19.60]There it is.
[157:21.06]Alright, nice.
[157:23.96]Free, baby.
[157:24.74]Nothing in the world is free anymore.
[157:26.18]We're luckin' out.
[157:27.24]Let's do it again.
[157:32.63]Edna's diner.
[157:33.29]Let's go blackmail the sheriff again.
[157:37.39]Save the game first, just in case something goes wrong.
[157:40.03]Now, I'm going to show him the copy, right?
[157:44.83]Alright.
[157:52.30]Photocopy.
[157:54.46]Well, look at this.

[158:02.75]I have the original.
[158:03.59]Uh, yeah, he's dead.

[159:06.67]I want more.
[159:07.11]Oh, Steve.
[159:09.23]I wish you'd been reasonable about this.
[159:11.23]Now you've left me no choice.
[159:14.64]Hey, wait!
[159:16.24]You can't risk this coming out.
[159:18.36]Your price is too high.
[159:19.56]Your price is too high.
[159:20.98]I don't feel good about this deal anymore.
[159:24.76]Guess I'll have to take my chances.
[159:27.74]Hey, wait a minute.
[159:28.28]You're going to zap me in the electric chair.
[159:41.29]Alright.

[164:37.60]But what's the point of killing her?
[164:38.68]There's no reason to kill her.
[164:39.70]She didn't do anything.
[164:41.08]Damn it.
[164:47.15]What?
[164:49.51]Let's press shift to speed Steve up.
[164:52.14]Alt is duck.
[165:15.90]Let's see what happens.
[165:35.32]I took her head off of the bat.
[165:45.97]So she was a wasp.
[165:48.95]Can I eat her sandwich?
[165:52.77]Can I dig inside of something?
[166:01.41]Aw, man.
[166:03.74]I'm not gonna get arrested for that, right?
[166:06.08]She was an alien wasp lady.
[166:08.04]No, I'm gonna need her later.
[166:16.68]I know I am.
[166:17.40]No, we gotta... Sayonara.
[166:27.51]She's gonna serve a purpose at some point, right?
[166:31.70]Oh, just because she's an alien, she has to die.
[166:33.68]Yes!
[166:36.38]Yes!
[166:36.66]Are you serious?
[166:41.74]If you found out that some lady down the street was an alien, and she had like a wasp asshole.
[166:48.92]Huh?
[166:50.68]And she had a giant stinger, and she was like, I'm so evil.
[166:55.22]Huh?
[166:55.38]Huh?
[167:04.02]Can I go in the sewer?
[167:05.28]No.
[167:11.29]Let's go back to the post office.
[167:17.23]She's an alien!
[167:19.43]My memory is gone.
[167:20.77]Alien spaceship sounds are everywhere.
[167:23.11]I've been teleported out of my home.
[167:25.92]I've been teleported back to here.
[167:28.44]And there's a wasp lady?
[167:29.50]You kidding me, man?
[167:33.85]I can't even make my point.
[167:34.93]You know what I'm saying?
[167:44.93]Alien lady, right?
[167:46.67]First of all, like, solid block of wood.
[167:50.08]Alien lady.
[167:50.86]Okay, we got an alien lady in our fucking town.
[167:53.70]Punch her fucking head off like that.
[167:56.54]Easy as pie.
[167:58.78]Ooh, it didn't even hurt.
[168:13.03]But that's wood.
[168:13.91]Examine the manhole.
[168:15.63]A manhole key is stuck in the top of a manhole cover.
[168:20.45]How do I get it out?
[168:21.01]Shovel?
[168:22.23]Bat?
[168:25.50]Or a loop.
[168:33.04]Ow!
[168:35.76]You aren't tough, though.
[168:36.44]Where's the tank top?
[168:37.08]I just, like, ripped out a bunch of hair.
[168:38.50]Fuck.
[168:48.04]A slimy manhole key.
[168:50.66]Okay, I got the manhole key.
[168:52.08]Well, that didn't work.
[168:52.96]Alright, can I... Bald.

[169:42.80]How do I... How do I scratch his car?
[169:46.72]It's inside of his fortress.
[169:50.94]God damn it.
[169:53.74]I can't get in here.
[169:55.76]Mr. Johnson erected an impenetrable fortress.
[169:58.77]Lube.
[170:06.19]Aw, man.
[170:07.85]What?
[170:11.05]Wait a minute.
[170:11.35]Manhole, manhole, manhole, manhole, manhole.
[170:15.01]Oh, fuck you.
[170:16.15]A small passageway leads to the sewers.
[170:17.59]Go in.
[170:22.92]Sealed wall due to water damage.
[170:25.82]Can I break it?
[170:26.80]Floor grate.

[171:13.68]Oh man.
[171:16.38]Oh baby boy.
[171:17.60]We got ourselves an indentation.
[171:22.59]Save it before something bad happens.
[171:33.26]Speed up, Steve.
[171:35.04]Shift doesn't do anything.
[171:40.18]Shit, I'm trying to make him run fast.
[171:41.59]There we go.
[171:43.99]Except for the cans.
[171:44.81]Empty oil cans litter the floor.
[171:48.15]Oil pan.
[171:50.61]Here's the car.
[171:52.30]Alright.
[171:53.02]Examine the Tucker.
[171:53.76]Mr. Johnson's prized possession.
[171:57.12]How do I scratch it up with the key?
[172:00.76]Did it.
[172:03.25]Okay.
[172:05.05]Done.
[172:05.81]Open the tool bench.

[174:13.52]No, there's not.
[174:14.04]It was a joke.
[174:15.46]The developers were kidding around.
[174:16.96]There's a little sofa.
[174:21.90]Pitchfork.

[182:19.02]Uh, Mr. Wolfgang, thanks for the five dollars.
[182:21.54]Uh, Robot, Mr. Destructoid, five hundred.
[182:24.12]I'm especially surprised with how upset you were about some old lady's wasp asshole.
[182:31.98]I live in the 21st century.
[182:34.60]If aliens come down, that means we're all dead.
[182:39.54]You know what I mean?
[182:41.16]If we were just an alien experiment, which is possible...
[182:44.86]You ever see Prometheus?
[182:46.78]Uh, based in reality, not fiction.
[182:48.76]Excuse me.
[182:50.96]Who are our creators?
[182:52.44]Remember the Mayans?
[182:53.88]The Mayans have sculptures of astronauts.
[182:56.62]Go look it up.
[182:57.18]It's on fucking Wikipedia.
[182:58.44]That's how you know it's real.
[183:02.30]Aliens have already came.
[183:03.96]They already came here like fucking 6,000 years ago.
[183:06.99]Go look it up.
[183:07.95]Type in Mayan astronaut sculpture.
[183:12.23]We're all dead.
[183:14.01]They're gonna come back
[183:17.96]Who built the pyramids?
[183:19.04]The aliens built the pyramids.
[183:22.35]How did aliens land on a flat Earth?
[183:24.97]That's a great fucking question.
[183:31.33]I'm just fucking kidding.
[183:32.69]Come on.

[183:57.04]He does have a point.
[183:58.60]He does have a point.
[184:00.51]Don't have a question, man.
[184:01.37]I beat Cuphead in four and a half hours.
[184:02.83]What streamer did that?
[184:04.31]Which one of your favorite streamers?
[184:05.71]Like www.favoritesfuckingtwitch.TV slash myfavoritestreamer.
[184:09.53]Would it take him like 12 hours to beat the fucking game?
[184:11.85]I beat that game in four and a half hours.
[184:17.18]WWW.

[184:33.72]Friendly reminder that Jerma985 is the best streamer.
[184:36.02]See this?
[184:36.72]He gets it.
[184:37.42]What do you think about the facecam?
[184:40.63]Should I delete it?
[184:41.27]Should I ever do it again?
[184:45.61]I feel like I'm just barely ugly enough.
[184:47.95]I'm on that really weird verge of you could be attractive, but you're ugly.
[184:54.92]You know what I mean?
[184:55.50]From this angle, I don't know.
[184:59.24]From this angle, I don't know.
[185:01.15]Depends on what angle.
[185:01.87]I gotta have like the right angle.
[185:02.83]Not the right fucking angle.
[185:03.87]I'm not attractive enough to be a fucking face camera.
[185:06.99]Here we go.
[185:08.11]No, that's not better.
[185:09.29]Over here.
[185:09.65]Fuck.
[185:18.86]Nah, I fucked it up again.
[185:21.74]Streaming is drunk and fishes for compliments.
[185:23.62]Give them to me!
[185:25.66]Thank you, FlinchyFerret, though.
[185:27.26]And Stormy2 for the $15.
[185:28.04]There's a lot of bits that I missed.
[185:31.60]I'm really sorry about this.
[185:32.86]That we're taking this time to, like, just... You know.
[185:37.97]Catch up, but... I mean, I'm doing it, so I'm here.
[185:40.91]We'll finish the rest of these at the end of the stream.
[185:44.05]But... Let's just... Colin Jets just gave $10.
[185:47.91]Shut up and take my money.
[185:49.63]You got it.
[185:53.78]Thank you, Colin.
[185:56.95]Sloppy 2 out of 10.
[186:00.12]Alright, we'll read the rest of those at the end of the stream.
[186:02.56]Because we've got murdering innocent people.
[186:05.76]We've got to kill innocent townspeople.
[186:08.04]Like with a baseball bat.
[186:09.06]I actually got me.
[186:15.12]You got me, game.
[186:17.54]They're not even innocent.
[186:18.90]Nobody in this game is innocent.
[186:19.88]They're all fucking bad people.
[186:22.65]So I don't think I can do anything with him.
[186:28.96]I guess we just have to see it.
[186:38.76]Use the arrow keys.
[186:40.08]What do you mean use arrow keys?
[186:43.18]Wait, I can like walk up and down the 3D plane?
[186:50.47]I did not know that.
[186:56.51]Ugh!
[186:58.32]Alright, he's dead.
[187:05.14]What was the point of this?
[187:09.18]Should I examine the matches?
[187:19.93]I can't bury him.
[187:20.67]No, I'm not doing that.
[187:21.83]We're gonna escape.
[187:23.11]Load game.
[187:25.17]I'll check the grave, and then we'll see what's going on here.
[187:27.09]I can't... There's nothing in the grave.
[187:30.77]I can't get in there.
[187:34.50]No.
[187:40.54]Look, isn't the whole point you want to keep everybody alive?
[187:47.49]You shovel on grave.
[187:48.59]Alright, well, I'll kill him again.
[187:49.65]Hold on.
[187:50.93]Gotta kill him with the right tool.
[187:54.51]Okay, use shovel, ungrave.

[189:51.45]I can open the window.
[189:54.31]Alright, open the window with the screwdriver that I picked up from somebody.
[189:58.65]There we go.
[190:01.61]Like most security devices, there's usually more than one trap to stop intruders.
[190:07.51]Breaking into my own house.
[190:08.95]It's my house.
[190:11.79]It's my house.
[190:20.63]You're gonna get me the electric chair for putting a screwdriver in my window.

[190:27.41]Is he tucking me in?
[191:03.75]Okay.
[191:10.03]That's a waste of the get-out-of-jail-free card.
[191:19.04]So that's not how you're supposed to do that.
[191:24.92]Can I move the cabinet now?
[191:30.02]Ah, dolly.

[199:44.49]No, I had to break in.
[199:46.13]What the hell is going on in here?
[199:48.61]I know it's a mystery to you.
[199:51.06]The sacred things that husbands and wives do behind closed doors.
[199:55.74]Maybe we should have that special father-son talk.
[199:59.36]Especially now that you're getting married.
[200:02.50]Am I?
[200:05.28]I'd like that.
[200:09.67]But listen.
[200:12.58]I can't talk very loud.
[200:15.66]It's the tracheotomy.
[200:17.48]What's that?
[200:17.78]What is that?
[200:19.19]What's that the study of?
[200:19.87]The study of, um... A man and a woman love each other very much.
[200:22.69]Tracheotomy is the study of... Going to a room alone.
[200:27.35]And tracheas... Is when somebody's a trachea specialist.
[200:30.37]With at least three locks.
[200:33.11]And proper chair under their tops.
[200:34.81]Triceratops.
[200:35.39]Tracheologist.
[200:36.47]You're a triceratopologist.
[200:37.67]Someone can get in.
[200:40.45]Or out.
[200:42.25]I'm missing the story!
[200:44.50]And get out... a wide variety of scalpels.
[200:49.90]Some curved.
[200:52.56]Some short.
[200:54.88]All of them sharp.
[200:57.36]And then the man climbs on the woman.
[201:01.21]And then they... With the barbed wire, they...
[201:11.02]That's alright.
[201:11.86]Don't get worked up.
[201:13.24]You need your rest.
[201:14.46]Teaching your son about how to have rest.
[201:18.12]But why did you come?
[201:19.90]You must have had a reason for risking it.
[201:23.65]I need some meat and Pat won't give me any without your signed permission.
[201:28.07]Good old appendable, Pat.
[201:30.37]Here, son.
[201:32.13]Here's my signature.
[201:34.21]Take it to him and you won't have any problem.
[201:37.22]Now go, son.
[201:38.68]Go quickly before she comes back.
[201:42.89]Who?
[201:44.77]Mom.
[201:45.35]This is no time to talk gibberish.
[201:47.41]I wrote mom.
[201:47.95]Alright, fuck off.
[201:48.77]Did you give me the thing I needed?
[201:49.51]Does it say it?
[201:50.53]Alright.
[201:54.01]Okay, Marv.
[201:54.67]Alright, let's go.
[202:02.32]How do we get out?
[202:05.88]No, leave that.
[202:07.54]I know she's out there.
[202:08.42]I get it.
[202:08.82]Go.
[202:08.98]Go.
[202:15.56]Let's go back to the meat factory.
[202:20.22]Meat factory.
[202:21.90]Get ourselves some meat.
[202:24.30]I just got back.
[202:24.86]Has Jerma been banned yet?
[202:27.26]Not yet.
[202:28.94]Soon.
[202:32.24]Alright, Marv.
[202:34.54]Hey, Marv.
[202:36.56]I've got a slip for you here.
[202:39.28]And what do I do with the meat?
[202:42.87]Give it to the dog?
[202:45.38]So, your father okayed the meat, huh?
[202:48.16]How's he doing?
[202:48.96]Not good.
[202:49.94]That psychotic bitch has him sliced to ribbons.
[202:52.35]Good, good.
[202:52.75]Glad to hear it.
[202:53.59]Here's your meat, son.
[202:54.51]You run along now.
[202:55.55]A new shipment of animals has come in and it's time to start cutting.
[203:05.08]Hunk of meat.
[203:08.94]Okay, that's somebody that... You know when you're in a conversation and you can tell the other person's not paying any attention?
[203:15.50]It's kind of like a way to determine if they are listening to you.
[203:19.41]Like if somebody's like on their phone and you're trying to get their attention.
[203:22.99]And you're like, hey, dude, so like the concert tomorrow.
[203:25.63]Yeah, yeah, yeah, concert.
[203:27.13]Hey, like my father's like chopped up by my mother.
[203:31.07]Oh, yeah, good.
[203:32.01]Cool.
[203:32.23]Glad to hear it, man.
[203:32.81]Cool.
[203:33.33]That's how you get, you know what I mean?
[203:34.27]Like that's what just happened.
[203:35.43]He's on his fucking iPhone.
[203:37.69]So you can tell he wasn't paying attention.
[203:39.39]He would have been very, very appalled by that.
[203:44.28]Firehouse.
[203:49.55]Try to give the meat to the dog.
[203:53.24]Save it, just in case this is wrong.
[204:02.98]Meat.
[204:03.96]Dog.
[204:06.23]Why did it just do that?
[204:06.95]I don't even know what that did.
[204:10.53]Oh, the meat is gone, but the fucking cutscene skipped immediately.
[204:13.33]What happened?
[204:15.13]Stop it, you're not... I don't convert...
[204:19.58]Did I get something?
[204:22.76]I'm not skipping these cutscenes.
[204:30.26]They're just skipping themselves.
[204:31.40]Did I get anything?
[204:38.09]I didn't get anything.
[204:38.83]I think I just wasted that meat.
[204:42.09]It's alright.
[204:44.49]Should I restart the game because it's bugged?
[204:47.03]That's probably not a bad idea.
[204:51.27]Let's go dig up the grave, though.
[204:55.58]Think of any other circumstance.
[204:57.20]Oh, no, whatever.
[204:58.44]Let's go dig up that person's grave.
[205:06.23]Alright, here we go.
[205:09.97]Move the picnic table.
[205:11.51]Fresh grave.
[205:13.23]Let's see who this guy was burying.
[205:18.69]You've been in there for a long time.
[205:20.65]Karen.
[205:21.05]Thank God I found you.
[205:22.53]Are you alright, Karen?
[205:24.61]I want to go home.
[205:26.71]Could you take me to my mommy's store?
[205:29.79]Or to the policeman?
[205:31.77]Can you tell me who did this to you?
[205:33.97]Mr. Potsdam told me he'd hurt my mommy if I told.
[205:39.01]You're not even in trouble.
[205:41.43]You've been buried for like 16 hours.
[205:43.05]Then he dug a hole.
[205:46.92]Please, I just want to go home now.
[205:50.14]Please.
[205:52.26]Can you tell me your address, honey?
[205:54.84]I don't know.
[205:56.26]Just take me to the store or the policeman.
[205:59.06]Please, mommy said to go to the policeman if I got lost.
[206:06.22]And I'm lost.
[206:07.91]No.
[206:10.05]Bye, bye.
[206:11.37]How do I take her to the policeman?
[206:12.77]No, I want to take her to the store.
[206:15.56]How do I take her to the store?
[206:18.00]Take her to- Bye, bu- I came for the meat.
[206:34.50]I'm not- No, I'm not gonna do what you think I'm gonna do, you fucking sickos.
[206:44.65]Outrageous.
[206:45.49]Outrageous thing to think that I was going to do.
[206:48.27]Outrageous.
[206:51.95]Look at what you've written in this chat.
[206:54.68]Out fucking rageous.
[206:57.04]I want you to examine.
[206:58.78]Examine the things that you just said.
[207:01.50]Take a look.
[207:02.36]Go up in the chat log.
[207:04.00]And look at yourself in the mirror.
[207:06.38]And grab yourself by the neck and be like, what are you doing?
[207:18.94]Do I have to use the dolly?
[207:20.32]Oh, she's gone.
[207:21.10]Fuck.
[207:22.30]Diner.
[207:22.72]Diner.
[207:23.02]Diner.
[207:23.30]Diner.
[207:23.54]Diner.
[207:23.78]Diner.
[207:24.00]Diner.
[207:24.22]Diner dash.
[207:24.70]Diner dash.
[207:25.16]Diner dash.
[207:31.65]Diner.
[207:33.29]Diner.
[207:33.67]Is she here?
[207:38.28]There she is.
[207:39.16]Bye bye.
[207:41.11]Okay, let's talk to Edna for a second about this.
[207:42.53]Oh, my God.
[207:44.11]Karen.
[207:45.41]Thank God.
[207:46.15]What happened?
[207:47.15]Check if she's in your inventory.
[207:50.79]She may have been in my inventory.
[207:53.02]And she claims Mr. Potsdam was responsible.
[207:56.60]Thank you, Steve.
[207:57.80]Thank you from both of us.
[207:59.70]Here.
[208:00.42]Here's the reward money.
[208:01.98]Take it and go.
[208:02.76]I need to be alone with my baby right now.
[208:11.45]How much is in there?
[208:16.42]That looks like a... That looks like a bone in the inside of a steak.
[208:23.26]Reward money.
[208:23.98]Alright, can I do anything else?
[208:27.42]I got money.
[208:31.96]Okay.
[208:37.87]What was the second task?
[208:41.24]What was the second task?
[208:42.08]I steal a bolt of fabric from the fireman.
[208:55.61]How do I get a bolt of fabric from the fireman?
[209:06.65]Meat plant.
[209:07.13]I got the mead.
[209:09.46]School, fire station, police station, hotel.
[209:14.96]I guess I could go in here.
[209:31.85]Talk to the guy about how he buried some kid.
[209:45.64]There he is.
[209:45.90]Yes, it did.
[209:46.38]I could just bury the pickaxe in the back.
[209:47.35]You...
[210:19.52]Yeah, I know what that crazy little bitch said, but it's not true.
[210:46.01]I was at home that night.
[210:47.43]Mrs. Potsdam will vouch for me.
[210:50.25]Isn't that right, Mrs. Potsdam?
[210:53.03]That's right, Mr. Potsdam.
[210:55.55]Hello, Steve.
[210:56.79]Care to stay for some pot roast?
[210:59.39]Forget the pot roast, Mother.
[211:01.98]Pot roast isn't for backstabbers.
[211:04.78]For persecutors.
[211:06.98]I won't share my meat with him.
[211:09.26]My meat!
[211:10.50]My meat!
[211:19.11]uh why are you covering up for him the truth that's why and I think you better be going young man before I call your mother and tell on you someone went and scraped up Johnson's car can you imagine he'd step in a bear trap and chew his own leg off rather than suffer a scratch tucker serves the rich bastard right if you ask me
[212:22.42]What?
[212:22.60]Disgusting.
[212:22.90]Don't eat red meat three times a day.
[212:30.02]Don't eat it three times a week.
[212:32.26]You should not be eating red meat more than like once or twice a week.
[212:51.75]Turkey!
[212:53.59]Turkey!
[212:59.28]Fucking better vote for me, number one handsome streamer.

[213:50.68]And also, would you remind him about the meat?
[213:54.08]Especially about the meat.
[213:55.60]Yeah, fine.
[213:57.72]You should be more concerned.
[213:59.84]If he dies, then who's going to take over the slaughterhouse?
[214:03.57]Who's going to tend to the meat?
[214:06.79]I guess it's his son.
[214:08.71]How do you know that one person?
[214:10.13]Right?
[214:12.01]I can look over here.
[214:12.69]I have analytics, guys.
[214:14.37]I can see over my analytics right now.
[214:16.57]You guys don't talk about information?

[214:49.52]Ah, okay.
[214:52.02]The rest of you guys have pop-up blockers.
[214:56.04]Smart.
[214:58.96]Can't get in there with a pop-up blocker on.
[215:05.02]I don't want to work in a filthy slaughterhouse.
[215:07.11]I think working in a slaughterhouse might be cool.
[215:09.35]Okay.
[215:18.84]What a grand business to go into.
[215:22.76]Alright, so let's just give him the meat.
[215:24.10]I'm sick of listening to this guy talk.
[215:26.73]Reaching into their bodies and yanking out the bloody guts, intestines dangling and slapping against you.
[215:33.45]The smell of death and shit in your nostrils all the time.
[215:37.36]Well, those are all definite cons of what you've done.
[215:44.52]They fucking don't do that.
[215:46.34]Why do they do that?
[215:52.39]That's the second time that that's fucking happened.
[215:56.11]Here you go.
[215:56.45]Here's your meat.
[215:57.67]Say, that's a nice cut there, Steve.
[216:01.75]Did you bring it for me?
[216:07.35]Yes or no?
[216:08.91]Sure, you can have it.
[216:09.63]Steve, you're a real champ.
[216:11.61]What a son-in-law you'd make.
[216:15.41]If it isn't my... Does it give me anything?
[216:21.46]What the fuck?
[216:24.35]Damn it.
[216:24.75]Now we gotta listen to this fucking idiot again.
[216:26.23]I just gave it to him for free.
[216:30.68]Remember, if you have it or something, never do it for Ray.
[216:33.54]Uh, here we go.
[216:40.66]If it isn't... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[216:44.07]Bye, stick up the meat.
[216:50.15]I need it.
[216:55.72]Minty Fresh Kitchen.
[216:59.91]Uh, should I go back upstairs and talk to the girl?
[217:04.37]I'm gonna say yes.
[217:07.25]She's still here, it's nighttime.
[217:10.39]I visited the lodge.
[217:12.15]Talked to the sergeant at arms there.
[217:15.23]He knows there's something out of whack here.
[217:17.18]He told me if I wanted to find out what it is, I should join the lodge.
[217:20.98]I decided to join the lodge, Stephanie.
[217:23.65]I think the answer to all our questions is inside.
[217:26.91]That place.
[217:30.37]Maybe, but it's not that bad.
[217:32.39]You may be playing right into their hands.
[217:34.85]Did you think of that?
[217:36.60]Doesn't it seem like you're being herded toward the lodge?
[217:39.06]That's one of the things I hope to find out.
[217:42.04]I hope finding out doesn't get you killed.
[217:45.38]My faux mother keeps me up on the latest gossip.
[217:48.24]Oh, the poison in the store.
[217:50.12]Not like she really wants to talk to me.
[217:52.69]Good call.
[217:53.42]More like she's feeding me information.
[217:56.12]We got five hours going here?
[217:57.52]For instance, she told me that Mr. Johnson's tucker was vandalized.
[218:00.50]We'll try to get to a good stopping point.
[218:02.59]And we'll probably call it in the next 45 minutes or so.
[218:05.73]Every car I've seen drive by is a tucker.
[218:08.83]There were only 31 produced.
[218:10.23]What are the odds of that?
[218:11.15]I've always wanted a tucker.
[218:14.74]Any idea who scratched the car?
[218:18.64]I did.
[218:19.22]Why would you do something?
[218:20.54]part of the lodge initiation.
[218:22.44]Should I be honest with this person?
[218:23.90]Look.
[218:24.48]I don't know what's going on here, but getting into the lodge is the best way to find out.
[218:28.74]By committing vandalism?
[218:30.46]Oh, shut up.
[218:32.20]By any means, it's a harmless prank.
[218:33.78]It was a crime, Steve.
[218:34.92]It's a prank!
[218:35.52]Don't be so melodramatic about it.
[218:38.13]I've heard of worse fraternity initiations.
[218:41.11]Sorry.
[218:42.79]See, you're overreacting.
[218:44.07]Put it that way, I guess I was overreacting.
[218:47.69]Is it true?
[218:49.11]You found Karen?
[218:50.98]Yeah.
[218:51.70]Just in time, too.
[218:53.26]He'd molested her and buried her alive.
[218:55.58]He couldn't bring himself to kill her outright.
[218:57.38]How would she know about this?
[218:58.04]So he just decided to stick her in the ground and let fate take its course.
[219:01.55]Why would she know?
[219:02.13]Who?
[219:03.73]Who would do that to a helpless child?
[219:05.41]Uh, it was your dad!
[219:06.47]She says it was Mr. Potsdam.
[219:08.99]And I believe her.
[219:10.53]Oh, Christ.
[219:12.23]And all this time I've been under the same roof with that... that thing... watching me!
[219:17.54]Take it easy, okay?
[219:20.16]So, at least they'll be coming to take him away, won't they?
[219:23.80]Should I tell the police?
[219:27.00]Can the police be told?
[219:31.99]Or is that not how this works?
[219:38.65]I don't want to go that way.
[219:39.47]I'm gonna show him the meat.
[219:43.90]I want him to see this meat.
[219:44.92]And I'm gonna fucking snatch it away from him.
[219:47.66]He's gonna be so pissed.
[219:51.61]No, I want you to take a look.
[219:53.13]Get your fucking feet off the table before I bash your head in with an axe.
[219:57.50]Disgusting.
[219:57.90]Fucking feet on the table.
[220:14.18]Get your feet off the table.
[220:17.82]Dave.
[220:18.84]Smith.
[220:19.18]It's you, Tease.
[220:24.63]Go to the store.
[220:27.47]General store.
[220:28.43]I have money, so... Examine.
[220:35.61]Examine the soup cans.
[220:36.53]Canned soup or possibly rat poison.
[220:39.81]I would like to buy the rat poison from you.
[220:42.84]If you'd be so inclined.
[220:45.15]Yes.
[220:45.23]Point at what you want.
[220:46.14]I would like a soup can.
[220:48.48]Coffee can.
[220:48.82]No.
[221:17.13]No, I gotta give her, like, money, don't I?
[221:24.21]Where's the money?
[221:25.31]Here you go.
[221:25.83]Take what you need.
[221:29.39]That should cover it.
[221:36.11]I can take the wrench.
[221:36.87]I can take the tape.
[221:41.59]Wrench?
[221:42.01]I can't get the poison.
[221:51.81]Well.
[221:56.09]Huh.
[221:58.95]I got a wrench and tape.
[222:00.26]Back to the sewer.
[222:07.40]Uh, let's use this on the valve in the sewer.
[222:09.82]The wrench.
[222:12.33]Why am I back here?
[222:13.43]Get out of here.
[222:13.81]Uh, it was in front of, uh, whose house?
[222:18.23]The Johnson house?
[222:20.57]Yeah.
[222:26.78]Um, can I open that back up?
[222:28.89]Is he gonna be mad if I do this?
[222:31.93]Yeah.
[222:33.07]I can't do this right now.
[222:36.93]I've been up all night.
[222:38.95]Fire station.
[222:42.58]So where do I get this fabric from?
[222:48.34]Somebody has a piece of fabric.
[222:50.58]I don't convert.
[222:54.83]Who gives this to me?
[222:55.86]Hello, Steve.
[222:57.74]Still sketching the same?
[222:59.10]It doesn't behoove one to be fickle.
[223:01.76]Longest cup of espresso.
[223:03.30]Yeah, man.
[223:04.32]It's just a little cappuccino.
[223:06.12]Nothing big deal.

[224:02.82]I need to throw the matches on something.
[224:05.38]What do I burn down?
[224:06.90]It was that debris.
[224:09.22]It was debris somewhere.
[224:10.37]I don't know where it was.

[224:46.11]Let's take a look at it.
[224:51.49]Fire alarm.
[224:59.54]Okay, all it takes is just to do it in front of the principal.

[227:09.38]Oh shit.
[227:13.69]Why is he just covered up?
[227:17.03]Why is this guy just under a sheet?
[227:25.37]I'm not a person, Steve.
[227:27.17]I'm an object.
[227:28.65]You'd do well to remember that.
[227:31.07]A person is his job.
[227:33.11]Someday you'll understand that.
[227:35.21]And if you don't, it won't matter because you'll be dead.
[227:39.13]Dead?
[227:40.09]Have you gotten your lodge application?
[227:42.95]Yes, I do.
[227:43.93]Good.
[227:44.93]You may survive.
[227:45.55]First time we've seen another image here.
[227:47.05]I guess you're here to steal the boat.
[227:50.51]Yeah, you got a rat on me, motherfucker?
[227:52.84]Spot's barking wakes the firemen and they call the sheriff.
[228:21.35]No, no, no, no.
[228:22.21]We're not using it here.
[228:24.73]Okay, Steve.
[228:25.13]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[228:26.65]Get out of here.
[228:27.25]Fuck you.
[228:27.99]Don't kiss me in the forehead like a fucking creep.
[228:30.85]Here.
[228:31.75]I don't care.
[228:35.53]Soiled it!
[228:36.51]Soiled it!
[228:39.51]Meet to the dog.
[228:41.15]Then talk to Guy.
[228:43.81]I get you.
[228:44.43]Okay.
[228:44.89]That's how we do it.
[228:47.37]Meet to the dog, you doofus.
[228:50.62]Easy.
[228:53.95]Meat to dog.
[228:56.70]Shut up.
[228:59.54]Mmm, wasn't that yummy?
[229:01.30]Hey, who's underneath the magician's tent?
[229:03.14]You.
[229:05.76]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[229:12.33]You gonna rat on me?
[229:13.25]No.
[229:14.27]Here's the clue.
[229:14.89]Darkness, darkness, darkness, darkness, darkness.
[229:16.69]Okay.
[229:16.83]Examine the mural.
[229:28.04]Fireplace.
[229:30.88]Matches.
[229:32.38]In the fireplace.
[229:33.72]Well, that didn't work.
[229:35.12]Dickhead.
[229:42.01]Painting.
[229:43.53]Nude men.
[229:45.27]Couple of nude men.
[229:50.86]Wow, I'm glad I didn't just kill this guy.
[229:52.64]That would have been bad.
[230:00.59]Oh, man.
[230:08.01]No ladder and tape, ladder and dolly.
[230:09.69]Oh, man.
[230:13.29]Matches on dog.
[230:14.41]Holy shit.
[230:20.21]Nude Dane.
[230:28.64]Light switch.
[230:33.74]Got it.
[230:34.00]Okay, light switch.
[230:37.86]The lights are too high to reach.
[230:40.98]I have a solution.
[230:47.05]You climb and retrieve a piece of cloth in the wall light.
[230:52.63]Did I- I got it?
[230:56.62]Where is it?
[231:00.28]There it is.
[231:01.88]Bingo.
[231:20.45]I just wanted to see what was going to happen.
[231:21.99]It wasn't for real.
[231:24.13]I wanted to see.
[231:24.77]We're going to reload the game.
[231:25.99]Don't worry.
[231:26.57]I got it.
[231:32.92]Dog witness.
[231:34.00]Is that?
[231:36.54]You can't even kill.
[231:37.14]You can't kill the dog guys.
[231:39.96]The dog is not attackable.
[231:50.33]No, the dog is not attackable.
[231:52.09]I already got the cloth, right?
[231:55.51]There's the cloth back to the cult leader.
[232:01.35]And let's turn it in.
[232:03.21]Having acquired the cloth, you make your way back to the house after an exhausting day.
[232:07.54]It's like the weird guy staring outside of his green screen house.
[232:15.40]It's Thursday, it's almost Friday.
[232:18.18]Friday's the bake sale.
[232:22.74]How long is this game?
[232:24.16]How long is Harvester?
[232:31.15]Are we getting near the end of the game?
[232:34.09]When we get to Friday?
[232:34.99]I should go to the sewer.
[232:47.00]It's a long time.
[232:56.04]I forgot the sewer.
[232:56.90]I'm going to go back to the sewer, don't worry.
[232:58.08]I'm going to head back to the sewer after this.
[233:01.72]That is making me hungry.
[233:03.61]Forget about all these terrible pieces of imagery.
[233:06.09]I'm like fucking hungry for a hamburger.
[233:07.89]What time is it?
[233:09.17]1?
[233:09.61]It's 1 a.m.
[233:13.91]We don't have to watch it.
[233:14.51]We've seen this like a thousand times.
[233:15.75]Let's open at 1 a.m.
[233:23.01]What, like, burger joints open at 1am?
[233:27.22]I'm hungry for fucking meat, you're right.
[233:33.54]Shut up.
[233:34.28]Shut up, you little shit.
[233:41.40]How do I get his gun?
[233:45.21]Wendy's.
[233:45.59]Wendy's is open pretty late.
[233:46.63]Alright, let's go to... I'm not gonna go to the lodge yet.
[233:50.25]Let's go to the sewer.
[233:52.36]So we have to go to the Johnson residence.
[233:55.60]No, I can't because I can't get down there.
[234:00.14]I need to use the manhole cover, but he's going to freak out.
[234:04.60]I might just kill this guy because I don't fucking care.
[234:08.06]Is it weird that I want to just chop this guy's head off with the axe and just go in the sewer?
[234:11.77]Does this guy give any value later on in the game?
[234:16.33]Double quarter pounder from Domino's?
[234:20.31]Yeah, it's not a bad idea.
[234:28.21]wasp lady has a manhole too yeah I I don't think I can I don't I can't interact with it it's kind of just there for aesthetic purposes I think damn it yeah okay yeah I can't it's gotta be that hole you can just walk in the garage not when he's standing there doesn't he tell you like to get away
[234:56.77]Alright, I thought he was going to be like, get out of there!
[235:05.20]Can I even... I don't think I can even get down here.
[235:10.06]No, I can't even go down the sewer.
[235:14.47]There is no way to go down anymore.
[235:16.79]I don't have an option.
[235:21.03]That's unfortunate.
[235:25.32]Unfortunately, I'm gonna yawn.
[235:33.43]We can't go down there.
[235:34.89]Use the ladder to get down there?
[235:37.87]That'd be weird if I could.
[235:38.81]There's no... There's nothing to even interact with here.
[235:42.01]Well, that didn't work.
[235:43.01]Okay.
[235:43.88]No.
[235:45.90]Oh, well.
[235:51.46]Gotta wait till nighttime.
[235:52.28]I'll come back and do it again.
[235:55.36]Let's go to the lodge.
[235:57.08]Turn in our cloth.
[236:00.24]Exquisite cloth.
[236:02.20]Its loss should trigger quite a bit of dissension amongst our gallant firefighters.
[236:09.40]Still, that is not your concern.
[236:12.88]Your next assignment is to break into the tonsil establishment of Mr. Pastorelli and abscond with his prized barber's bowl.
[236:24.30]What, like, delivers at, like, 2 o'clock in the morning?
[236:27.58]What?
[236:27.80]We're gonna get delivery!
[236:34.52]Sorry, I'm not a good Bane.
[236:36.70]Uh, fine, I'll do it.
[236:37.68]I'm thinking of opening a salon, Sarge.
[236:39.52]You're making me hungry.
[236:43.14]Uh... Postmates?
[236:51.76]Uh, I've had enough of this.
[236:53.18]I'm no thief.
[236:53.64]Fine, I'll do it.
[237:01.21]Break into the shop, steal the barber's pole.
[237:05.69]Alright, so I gotta break into the store, steal the barber pole, and bring it back.
[237:14.60]What kind of mundane shit tasks does this guy want me to do?
[237:20.52]I forgot how to do the voice.
[237:21.29]How do you do the voice?
[237:25.75]Fuck.
[237:26.45]I forgot how to do it.
[237:27.41]I'm supposed to...
[237:29.65]Next time.
[237:30.55]I don't know how to do it.
[237:34.79]I had it nailed like an hour ago.
[237:36.65]You heard it.
[237:50.76]Next time.
[238:01.33]I wonder if this guy talks to his kids like this.
[238:03.61]Hey, where we going?
[238:25.91]Break into smaller than average beer.
[238:31.97]What am I doing?
[238:33.26]My house?
[238:33.72]Your house?
[238:34.08]Hey, we're going to your house?
[238:36.64]You hear that, guys?
[238:37.46]All 2,500 of us.
[238:38.56]We're going to your house.
[238:41.16]See you in like 10 minutes.
[238:44.57]That's a corrupted, yeah, kind of a general story.
[238:46.99]Can I do anything here?
[238:47.61]Nah, I get the fuck out of here.
[238:58.38]I gotta wait till it's dark.
[239:04.22]What can I do?
[239:05.27]Where else can I go?
[239:07.59]Meat plant, the TV station.
[239:09.11]I haven't been to the TV station in a long time.
[239:14.83]We haven't been back to the missile base in a long time either.
[239:25.59]I'm going to Dave Smith's house.
[239:31.05]Um, maybe I can just take it now.
[239:39.38]Fancy bar was pulled secure to the wall with straight slot screws.
[240:13.10]That's way more gruesome with the axe.
[240:20.76]That was disgusting with the axe.
[240:23.76]I can't take it.
[240:27.04]Straight slot screws.
[240:29.70]Screwdriver.
[240:30.35]Barber's pole.
[240:33.01]Oh man.
[240:43.15]Can't do it.
[240:46.60]Not a Phillips head.
[240:47.50]Well, what the fuck, man?
[240:48.62]You can use a Phillips head.
[240:49.50]You can use a knife.
[241:00.22]There are aliens.
[241:01.48]Yeah, we got the cutscene.
[241:02.42]We saw that earlier.
[241:10.67]Well.
[241:13.39]What about... Let's go... Talk to the girl.
[241:16.23]You mean little girl here?
[241:17.07]Talk about the girl.
[241:20.89]Bye-bye.
[241:21.96]Oh, she says bye-bye.
[241:22.82]I can't talk now.
[241:23.70]The dishes are stacked up and back and I better take a... I just heard that Mr. Johnson's Tucker was vandalized.
[241:30.92]You know, though I don't like to think ill of people or take pleasure in the misfortunes of others.
[241:36.38]She has plenty of time, I guess.
[241:37.28]I'd like to think it's a comeuppance for all the times that nasty man has bothered me.
[241:42.51]Let's be a yes man here.
[241:43.23]Never mind.
[241:43.59]Nothing else can be done in the diner.
[241:44.83]Is that what I understand here?
[241:46.58]And unlock...
[242:19.08]Celebration Here's my idea Hey
[243:10.56]Wow.
[243:15.23]Okay, that's enough of that.
[243:17.11]Oh my lord.
[243:18.17]I was trying to hit the lady.

[244:11.53]The barber shop, right?
[244:16.57]Jesus Christ.
[244:19.21]Jesus Christ.
[244:21.77]Oh my God.
[244:22.89]Okay.
[244:25.29]I don't even, I forget where the barber shop is.
[244:27.09]I'm like, okay, there it is.
[244:30.79]The barber shop is closed.
[244:35.28]I can't believe you can do that in this game.
[244:37.54]What a fucking, that is fucking insane.
[244:56.74]Okay.
[244:57.40]Wrench.
[245:24.10]Oh, man.
[245:24.94]What?
[245:26.30]Oh, man.
[245:26.96]What?
[245:27.74]Damn it.
[245:28.78]Well, that didn't work.
[245:32.66]Why?
[245:33.16]What?
[245:33.52]Why?
[245:33.84]What?
[245:40.46]Tape?
[245:41.74]Well, that didn't work.
[245:43.34]Well, that didn't work.
[245:46.98]Put lube on.
[245:47.63]I don't have any lube left.
[245:53.22]The wrench didn't work on the grate.
[245:55.18]No.
[245:55.58]Damn it.
[245:56.80]Didn't work.
[245:57.86]Okay.
[245:58.42]Well, that didn't work.
[246:02.76]You laughed your butt off at a kid running into a wall in a horror game.
[246:09.97]I think there's a very large difference between, like, doink!
[246:14.49]Oh, some... Uh-huh.
[246:16.35]And, like... Whack!
[246:20.00]Yo!
[246:21.60]Difference!
[246:23.04]Whoa!
[246:25.86]Uh, I can't do anything down here, apparently.
[246:31.54]Okay.
[246:32.26]Aw, man.
[246:33.26]Damn it.
[246:34.02]Aw, man.
[246:34.68]Tampons don't work either.
[246:46.19]Um, I can't do anything here.
[246:51.61]We have to break into the barbershop.
[246:54.35]Somehow.
[246:58.29]Axe on the barbershop door.
[247:00.21]That's not exactly a professional would break in.
[247:04.70]What do they need the screwdriver for?
[247:06.48]I got a flathead Phillips for what?
[247:08.46]What do they need that for?
[247:11.04]Oh, the barbershop door.
[247:12.36]The pole.
[247:12.85]Okay.
[247:14.89]Wrench on the door.
[247:16.29]That's not a professional.
[247:17.31]Tape on the door.
[247:25.07]Why did I do that?
[247:25.67]Are you serious?
[247:32.41]I taped up the window and smashed it.
[247:34.17]Doesn't that kind of go against everything?
[247:42.42]What?
[247:44.98]Oh, fuck you.
[247:46.40]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[247:48.26]God damn it.
[248:03.18]Where was I here?
[248:04.30]Idea.
[248:04.64]What was my idea?
[248:08.08]I had an idea, apparently.
[248:13.42]Get the fuck out of here.
[248:24.72]Bright idea!
[248:25.57]Okay, uh, barbershop.
[248:32.15]Tape.
[248:35.75]Smash it with the axe.
[248:39.05]Turn the power off.
[248:42.36]It's the sheep's face.
[248:47.58]How do I turn off the power?
[248:55.13]That's it.
[248:56.01]I just have to turn the light switch off?
[248:58.55]Yeah.
[249:00.93]Okay, that's kind of really dumb.
[249:04.61]Anything else in here I can take?
[249:08.43]Some security system.
[249:09.99]It's a light switch.
[249:13.08]Alright, let's head back.
[249:14.10]Save it.
[249:15.40]I get my final task before I'm allowed.
[249:17.92]We can replace idea.
[249:26.70]Move on.
[249:30.06]Use the tape on the light switch.
[249:33.39]Having acquired the barber pole, you make your way back to the house.
[249:37.69]It is now Friday.
[249:44.43]Friday night.
[249:45.67]Time for the harvest sale.
[249:51.36]Oh yeah, skip.

[250:10.03]I just want to see the hamburger one more time.
[250:18.80]I can smell it already.
[250:20.12]It's got pickles, lettuce, onions.
[250:22.38]Two all-beef patties, lettuce, sauce, chickles, cheese, and a sesame bean bun.
[250:27.61]Chickles?
[250:29.73]Two all-beef patties, lettuce, sauce.

[253:50.87]Okay.
[253:51.95]Let's go talk to Mario.
[253:55.25]Hey, it's too bad they don't give scalp badges for digging up buried kids.
[254:00.06]I'd like to see what that badge would look like.
[254:03.13]I went over to ask her what it was like being buried alive and all, but she just stared at me and twitched and drew up.
[254:13.28]That's creepy.
[254:14.06]Yes, I got my answer.
[254:15.16]Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed fucking bun.
[254:21.38]Good.
[254:23.53]Got it.
[254:25.20]Hello, dear.
[254:26.46]By the way, I spoke with Mr. Johnson, and he's living.
[254:30.24]Seems someone scratched up his priceless tucker.
[254:33.08]If he finds out who, they'll be heck to pay.
[254:35.87]Did you hear what happened at the barber shop?
[254:37.93]Someone broke into Pastorelli's salon and took his antique barber's pole.
[254:41.49]The next morning, Pastorelli touched some live wires that the thief left lying around and was electrocuted.
[254:48.99]Well, that darn foreigner got what he deserved, if you ask me.
[254:52.18]Coming into a nice little town like Harvest and stealing business.
[254:56.64]Heavens, if a bow and scissors were good enough for your father, I don't see why decent working folk need a fancy wop styling their hair.
[255:04.91]That's how it goes.
[255:05.81]First you get a sissy trim, then bang, you're a communist.
[255:10.11]I hear those silly firemen broke out the axes and hacked each other to death.
[255:14.11]Things never were the same between them after the firehouse robbery.
[255:17.53]Oh, well, maybe now we'll get some real men for the fire department.
[255:21.46]I killed them, but everybody died.
[255:24.26]What do you mean?
[255:25.64]Can't you feel it?
[255:26.38]The way the stalks whisper in the autumn wind?
[255:29.52]It's almost harvest time, Steve, when the chaff will be cast aside before the feast.
[255:34.02]Congratulations, hero.
[255:36.01]You found Karen after all.
[255:37.67]You don't seem proud, mother.
[255:39.87]Am I running out of time?
[255:40.85]I can't, like, we kind of need to finish this game, right?
[255:42.95]I'm way too intrigued at what the fuck is actually going on in this game.
[255:46.74]To not complete it.
[256:06.48]Can't believe he would do something like that.
[256:08.64]Neither can I. She should be spanked for being such a nasty little liar.
[256:12.88]What?
[256:15.30]Isn't it exciting, Steve?
[256:17.04]Five days and 1,200 cookies later, the bake sale is already here.
[256:20.99]Yeah, we're going all night.
[256:22.35]In case anyone was wondering.
[256:23.97]We are going all night, boys and girls.
[256:26.35]Until we get the game.
[256:27.29]How many are you taking to the sale?
[256:29.70]Oh, about 20.
[256:30.36]The rest will stay on.
[256:31.70]All night.
[256:32.32]But the effort wasn't wasted.
[256:33.72]It's for a good cause.
[256:35.66]Will you be at the school tonight?
[256:38.44]Hey, I wouldn't miss it for anything.
[256:39.40]That's nice, dear.
[256:40.50]It's good to be open to new experiences.
[256:44.86]A good cause.
[256:45.36]Don't you think it's odd?
[256:47.02]Having a bake sale to pay for burying out-of-towners?
[256:50.61]Gosh-a-hoodies.
[256:51.43]What should we do?
[256:52.21]Leave them in the streets?
[256:53.05]I need to eat, though.
[256:54.01]Of course we should bury them.
[256:55.69]But why do so many out-of-towners drop dead in harvest?
[256:59.86]I have wondered about that, and I think it has something to do with the air.
[257:05.20]But there's nothing wrong with the air.
[257:06.82]It's perfectly clean.
[257:08.58]That's what I mean.
[257:09.40]Clean air is what we want.
[257:10.20]Big city folk, they get so used to smog that clean air is a shock to their systems.
[257:14.20]Gets them every time.
[257:20.17]All night.
[257:22.27]Don't forget to put the papers out for Jimmy.
[257:29.68]I need, like, snacks.
[257:31.02]What can I get for snacks?
[257:46.15]A newborn baby is sleeping soundly.
[257:47.59]Okay.
[257:48.81]Hello, dear.
[257:53.13]What a thing to say to your mother.
[257:56.97]Maybe later, dear.
[257:58.14]Don't forget to put the papers out.
[257:59.72]Come on, Mom.
[258:00.48]What?
[258:00.84]Stop it.
[258:01.36]Jeremy.
[258:04.28]Jesus Christ.
[258:08.74]Great.
[258:11.45]Alright.
[258:12.75]Back to the lodge.
[258:18.85]Paper?
[258:20.01]I don't have a paper.
[258:20.63]There's no paper.
[258:21.21]I have an axe.
[258:23.37]No, I unequipped the axe.
[258:27.55]You son of a bitch.
[258:28.74]Next time I go to your house and you ain't put out that paper, you'll be sorry.
[258:35.50]He does have a gun.
[258:36.70]I'm not gonna... You son of a bitch.
[258:40.07]He does have a gun.
[258:41.63]I want his gun.
[258:42.67]How do I get his gun?
[258:50.41]No, I don't.
[258:51.29]Stop it.
[258:52.01]Go.
[258:52.69]Out.
[258:53.11]Leave.
[258:54.19]Leave.
[258:54.93]Go to the lodge.
[258:56.01]Okay, wiseass.
[258:57.29]I warned you.
[258:58.23]I gotta take him out.
[259:01.39]I gotta take out the kid.
[259:26.90]Can't shoot that fast.
[259:28.62]Where's the paper?
[259:29.72]It's right here, right?
[259:30.88]Jesus fucking Christ.
[259:32.48]Well, that didn't work.
[259:35.92]Here's your paper.
[259:36.82]Please don't murder me.
[259:40.38]Hey, Steve.
[259:41.33]You've been doing a swell job putting the paper out in the morning.
[259:44.39]You just keep doing that and we won't have any problems.
[259:47.75]That's not much to ask, is it?
[259:59.40]Why is he angry?
[260:05.36]I did it.
[260:09.07]Lodge.
[260:11.35]Final task.
[260:11.99]Can I finally go in here?
[260:30.28]Don't laugh.
[260:31.04]Why am I laughing?
[260:31.86]God, this is fucking a comedy show now.
[260:34.22]He got electrocuted to death.
[260:38.96]Jesus Christ.
[260:42.11]Uh, took a big spill.
[260:43.19]A permanent one.
[260:44.33]Yes.
[260:44.79]A barber.
[260:46.91]Cut down in his prime.
[260:51.04]So what's the final task?
[260:53.96]Set a fire.
[261:06.60]Okay.
[261:07.55]Ah, jeez, that's no minor prank.
[261:08.99]That's arson.
[261:09.81]Forget it.
[261:10.57]Alright, you're getting these suggestions.
[261:12.95]I suggest you succeed.
[261:15.17]Beyond that, you must find your own answers.
[261:19.03]Members of the Order must be resourceful and cunning.
[261:22.98]Have you ever modeled before?
[261:24.36]Oh, wait, you have to be at least six foot tall.
[261:26.40]That's not true.
[261:28.46]That is complete fabrication.
[261:30.14]Untrue.
[261:32.16]Soon, the annual harvest blood
[261:38.78]When sacrifice will be the order of the day, your time in harvest grows short.
[261:54.13]Alright, so we gotta go and light the diner on fire.
[261:57.63]You got it.
[261:58.39]Diner.
[261:59.55]Here's the diner.
[262:00.21]Fire.
[262:01.82]Burn it.
[262:15.99]Let's burn it to the ground.
[262:16.78]Um...
[262:21.35]I can't talk now.
[262:22.95]I've whipped up a huge batch of brownies for the PTA bake sale tonight.
[262:27.30]I just wish I could do more to help out those poor bums.
[262:30.48]I wish I could help out those poor bums.
[262:34.08]How will the sale help bums?
[262:35.46]What time is the bake sale?
[262:36.14]I think it starts at 6 and runs until 10 o'clock.
[262:39.43]Mr. Pastorelli was electrocuted.
[262:41.95]He's dead.
[262:43.53]It looks like some thief wanted his barber's pole but didn't think of the consequences.
[262:48.26]Maybe it's what the guy had to do.
[262:50.26]Maybe whoever it was really needed that barber's pole bad.
[262:53.72]That's no excuse for hurting someone else.
[262:56.56]Even if Pastorelli were alive now, his heart would be broken.
[263:00.38]And what's a little profit compared to that?
[263:05.81]Leave!
[263:06.33]Sorry, I missed that.
[263:07.25]Alright, matches.
[263:11.33]Throw matches into the fucking friolator.
[263:14.57]Yes, that's fair enough.
[263:18.72]Put the fryer later on like 600 degrees.
[263:23.53]Boink!
[263:24.37]Right into the fryer later.
[263:25.25]Well, that didn't work.
[263:26.67]Well, I can't do anything.
[263:33.29]Just pacing around back and forth with a fire axe.
[263:37.19]What a sicko.
[263:40.54]Well, that didn't work.
[263:41.82]Well, that didn't work.
[263:43.24]Well, that didn't work.
[263:46.16]Can't do anything.
[263:53.46]Bye-bye.
[263:55.98]God damn it.
[263:59.62]Where's the fryer later?
[264:11.17]Cake cover?
[264:12.98]Grease fryer!
[264:13.64]Alright.
[264:19.00]Etta does not let her customers behind the counter.
[264:21.26]Just throw them in there.
[264:24.87]Aw, man.
[264:25.89]Aw, man.
[264:26.87]Well, that didn't work.
[264:27.50]Well, it's during the bake sale.
[264:29.72]This is when this happens.
[264:37.00]So I can't burn this place down until... So what is left to do?
[264:43.45]My house.
[264:44.33]There's the... I can go talk to the... At night.
[264:47.07]Yeah, I know.
[264:48.51]Alright, so we're gonna burn the place down.
[264:49.91]Let's go talk to the girl?
[264:51.61]We haven't been here in a while.
[264:56.51]Steve, it's so good to see you again.
[265:00.05]I'm sorry.
[265:02.14]Wanna hear what's happening out in the real world?
[265:04.34]But that's not till like later today, right?
[265:06.22]I'd rather forget about Harvest for a while.
[265:09.22]Stephanie?
[265:10.70]I feel so close to you, Steve.
[265:13.68]Like we're the only two people in Harvest.
[265:16.84]The only two real people.
[265:18.85]What happened?
[265:20.09]Do you know what I mean?
[265:24.15]You've been shut up here too long.
[265:25.05]Did that skip the sex scene?
[265:26.97]Thank God.
[265:27.27]I'm gonna reload the game.
[265:27.95]Uh, something's fucked up.
[265:28.99]I thought that- Oh, do you now?
[265:58.80]Wait a minute!
[266:00.12]Wait, wait, wait.
[266:00.55]This is part of... Wrong facecam!
[266:03.69]Somebody's looking through the people.
[266:15.98]I think the dad is looking through the people.
[266:58.86]Ah, the deed is done.
[267:00.06]Just with my fire axe.
[267:04.44]I have to fuck with my fire axe in my hands.
[267:06.68]It's really important.
[267:08.78]This is the only way I can get off.
[267:13.93]Give me a break.
[267:14.61]Yes it is.
[267:20.14]Me too.
[267:28.80]It's insane.
[267:29.96]The maniacal attention paid to this bake sale.
[267:32.18]Is there any other way?
[267:33.08]Like all the women in Harvest came from the same cookie cutter.
[267:36.46]Look at this.
[267:37.12]It's unnatural.
[267:38.08]It's unhealthy.
[267:39.36]Terrifying.
[267:40.52]Almost a parody of how things should be.
[267:43.18]And through my window at night.
[267:45.62]I see my mother throwing out whole batches of cookies.
[267:48.55]What's with the cookies thing?
[267:49.29]Like an automaton getting rid of its surplus product.
[267:51.27]I don't understand the cookies thing.
[267:52.25]My so-called mother has been baking cookies all week.
[267:55.23]And then throwing them out.
[267:55.97]Cookies is like a metaphor for something.
[267:57.03]There's going to be a big twist in the end.
[267:58.73]That's why we have to stay up and see what it is.
[268:00.33]Wait around long enough.
[268:01.29]I have a feeling they'll get to it.
[268:05.02]You know the firemen?
[268:06.84]Someone stole some fabric from them.
[268:08.88]Yeah.
[268:10.18]I took that.
[268:10.72]Should I just tell her it's me every time?
[268:16.56]I can tell her it's me every time.
[268:19.30]However many it takes to get in, Stephanie.
[268:21.49]If I have to use them to escape, then I will.
[268:23.83]Should I do truth every time to her?
[268:25.11]Are you using them?
[268:26.91]Or are they using you?
[268:28.33]It was just a bolt of cloth.
[268:31.11]You've turned the firemen against each other.
[268:33.40]They think one of their own stole it.
[268:35.70]Would you rather stay here?
[268:38.66]I've heard that harvest is lovely in the fall when the leaves turn orange and gold and the annual blood drive paints the town red.
[268:45.63]I know.
[268:45.87]You are way behind here, lady.
[268:48.87]You were like a full two or three weeks where the rumor is behind.
[268:54.07]I didn't mean to kill him.
[268:55.99]I just wanted the pole.
[269:11.92]Oh my god.
[269:13.12]Steve, that was no little prank.
[269:14.92]A man died.
[269:15.98]I'm not a liar.
[269:17.22]I'm not a liar.
[269:17.94]I forgot about the live wires in the water.
[269:20.98]I'm not a liar.
[269:21.98]That doesn't change the fact that you killed him.
[269:24.57]This initiation killed him.
[269:27.39]It was just an accident.
[269:30.11]An accident which wouldn't have happened if not for the lodge.
[269:33.57]Don't you see?
[269:34.41]I'm beginning to think that the lodge poisons everything it touches.
[269:40.08]Harvest...
[269:42.34]Even you.
[269:43.19]Okay.
[269:43.63]I didn't create this situation.
[269:45.49]Are you sure?
[269:46.01]I didn't create this situation.
[269:47.87]But however it started, I'm gonna see through it.
[269:50.05]Short for situation.
[269:51.03]Short for situation.
[269:51.91]Vandalism, theft, manslaughter.
[269:55.87]What's next, Steve?
[269:56.82]Murder?
[269:57.22]Look, I know in the beginning I suggested you might check out the lodge.
[270:02.64]I was more worried about getting out of here than anything else.
[270:06.30]But now that I know you, I'm worried about you too.
[270:12.00]A man is dead because of you.
[270:13.46]How can you be fine?
[270:15.12]Tell me.
[270:16.16]Is anything positive going to come out of this lodge initiation crap?
[270:20.71]Yeah, us leaving.
[270:22.19]It just seems to me that this order of yours is getting you in deeper and deeper trouble.
[270:25.97]They can't make me do anything I don't want to do.
[270:29.17]No.
[270:29.41]But maybe when it's all said and done, you'll want to do anything.
[270:34.62]You've got to trust me.
[270:36.20]Trust me.
[270:37.28]Bye.
[270:38.82]Come back and...
[270:48.64]Ugh!
[271:19.75]That's alright guys.
[271:20.86]He was just made out of chocolate.
[271:28.46]It wasn't even a real Mr. Potterson.
[271:30.21]The real Mr. Potterson wasn't made out of caramel.
[271:49.99]Ah.
[271:53.80]He's sitting there playing Nintendo.
[271:55.18]What is he doing?
[271:59.54]What about her?
[272:00.00]What is it like when I do it to her?
[272:03.72]Some people are not killable.
[272:07.80]I think she's one of them.
[272:10.54]She is.
[272:10.92]She is one of them.
[272:15.52]So everybody can die in this game.
[272:23.50]So can you just do like a total... Can you just kill everybody?
[272:27.78]What happens if you kill every single person in town?
[272:30.65]Can you even complete the game?
[272:41.64]Okay, it needs to be night time.
[272:46.33]post office general store what about the blind lady a military base school bake sale right here comes the bake sale bake sale Friday seeing you here again one would think you'd never graduated nostalgia is a waste of time big guy

[273:23.09]Mr. Johnson says one of my pupils scratched his priceless tucker.
[273:27.55]I must say, I was relieved when I learned he had no evidence pointing to one of my kids.
[273:33.30]I can't even do that face.
[273:34.28]If he had, some lucky boy or girl would have been in for some quality time.
[273:38.06]If I was a fat guy, I would do that all the fucking time.
[273:40.74]When I went to get my hair trimmed this morning, imagine my surprise when I learned that the barbershop had been burglarized.
[273:48.22]And worse, that Mr. Pastorelli had been electrocuted.
[273:52.56]Harvest mourns the loss of an irreplaceable citizen.
[273:56.76]All of us will feel the loss only with the passage of time.
[274:00.46]Say, congratulations on finding Karen Fitzpatrick.
[274:03.34]Why am I getting congratulated for this?
[274:04.58]I don't know how you did it, but if I were still publishing the Sentinel, you can bet I'd run a full profile on you.
[274:10.56]Jesus Christ.
[274:11.14]Hey, you know, good job.
[274:12.40]You found that buried kid that was buried alive.
[274:15.12]Good for you.
[274:15.68]That's interesting.
[274:16.54]Really nice stuff.
[274:17.20]Really nice work.
[274:18.91]Drop in again soon.
[274:25.95]Let's see how this guy dies.
[274:26.99]We're going to keep... What's the situation?
[274:31.64]What's the situation?
[274:32.60]You know what I mean?
[274:35.26]We're going to get on the same Tomb Raider plane.
[274:37.16]Hold on.
[274:40.58]Right here?
[274:44.35]No, that's not right.
[274:51.97]Kids!
[275:25.24]Okay.
[275:28.14]Bake sale is tonight.
[275:34.94]This game is fucked.
[275:42.89]The TV station.
[275:43.75]I don't know.
[275:45.79]How do I pass some time here?
[275:48.80]Hotel?
[275:49.28]I don't know.
[275:52.64]How do I pass some time?
[275:56.28]The barbershop is probably closed, right?
[276:01.46]No.
[276:02.36]There's the guy's outline of the guy's body.
[276:05.36]That's terrifying.
[276:06.16]The sheep... is gone.
[276:10.44]Alright, uh, what do you guys have to- It's just the outline of this guy's body.
[276:16.29]What are you talking about?
[276:25.26]I really think you should talk your father into buying some.
[276:28.94]He can afford it.
[276:29.90]They don't care.
[276:30.72]And I can't stress enough the value of some really fine aluminum siding.
[276:36.22]Keeps it warm in the summer.
[276:38.32]Pastorelli ought to look into some.
[276:40.79]But I can't get him to understand a word I say.
[276:43.45]I was wondering what found Pastorelli this morning after he stepped in the water with the live wires hanging out.
[276:52.24]His body was so burnt, his arms and legs was blackened, fused together, and the sheep was well done too.
[277:02.68]Problem is, both was burnt so bad, and the flesh all crisp and distorted, limbs melded.
[277:10.55]You couldn't tell them apart.
[277:12.43]And well, I didn't want to take a chance on eating Italian.
[277:17.45]No sir, I didn't.
[277:20.53]I tell you, the only thing worse than a fire station full of sissies is a fire station full of peeved sissies.
[277:31.41]They're all accusing each other of stealing some silk underwear or something.
[277:37.75]Boy, whoever said fighting fire with fire be happy in harvest, because we got a fire station full of flamers.
[277:47.66]Oh, my lord.
[277:50.56]Pastorelli's a rube from way back.
[277:54.00]Alright, I've had enough of you.
[277:56.14]Shut up.
[277:56.48]Nice to see you.
[277:58.76]Hello there, youngster.
[278:00.35]You say them aliens I was telling you about?
[278:02.49]Well, they came back last night.
[278:04.69]Cut another crop circle.
[278:06.09]How come I never see none of them saucers, Clem?
[278:08.71]Them aliens is wildly picky.
[278:11.82]You don't cross the intergalactic border.
[278:14.64]You know what Pastor Ellie did?
[278:16.27]Yesterday, he gets an alarm system to protect his pole.
[278:20.05]Only he don't know how to rig it, so now it's all a ride.
[278:23.43]Dang it if the whole town ain't going to hell.
[278:26.41]Poor old Johnson.
[278:28.71]Well, that's a sure sign.
[278:30.47]Let's see.
[278:31.19]Yeah.
[278:32.25]We have to watch this because he says a certain word here.
[278:35.29]That's all we had to hear.
[278:36.87]Goodbye.
[278:37.42]Thanks for nothing.
[279:00.98]Let's go to the fire station and see what the hell is going on in the fire station.
[279:09.55]I don't think I can go into the fire station right now.
[279:17.31]No, I cannot go in the fire station.
[279:22.45]Unfortunately, we cannot.
[279:32.46]Barbershop, post office, general store.
[279:37.79]How do I progress to nighttime?
[279:44.05]Mortuary.
[279:49.54]There he is again.
[279:50.16]I can't take this.
[279:51.00]Wait, do I have anything now that he wants to take from me?
[279:54.26]What about like an axe?
[279:56.16]Why should I care?
[279:58.95]There's got to be something.
[279:59.83]I have so many items now that he doesn't want any of these things.
[280:04.52]I can't take the glue.
[280:17.57]Here's the chapel.
[280:18.61]This doesn't do anything.
[280:20.35]The autograph.
[280:20.91]I don't think this guy wants the autograph.
[280:22.19]No.
[280:28.98]Have I tried killing him?
[280:30.24]No, not yet.
[280:33.48]Landscape.
[280:35.88]No.
[280:40.39]I could just take it by force.
[280:41.67]I could kill him and take it.
[280:46.01]I need to progress some time here.
[280:54.55]Yeah, yeah.
[280:55.29]Alright.
[280:55.65]Any suggestions?
[280:56.59]Run it down.
[280:57.35]I need to progress it to time.
[280:59.63]I need to progress it to time.
[281:12.50]Police station?
[281:17.16]Anything in here?
[281:20.89]Boy, the way you keep pestering me,
[281:24.26]I got a report here that someone put a ding on Johnson's Tucker.
[281:27.86]Everyone cares so much about this shit.
[281:30.20]As ornery as Johnson is about that old car, I suppose he had it coming.
[281:34.92]Get the doctor the medicine.
[281:35.66]I imagine it was just some kids pulling up.
[281:38.97]I'm nowhere near solving the Tucker case.
[281:41.31]And now I have to deal with a bunch of... What the heck is going on?
[281:43.09]Somebody stole some cloth.
[281:44.01]Looks like we've got us a mini crime wave on our hands.
[281:47.59]Just got a report about another act of vandalism.
[281:50.92]Next morning, pastorelli.
[281:52.50]Yes, he's dead.
[281:53.12]I don't like it.
[281:55.03]Did you hear that McKnight was killed?
[281:57.15]Isn't that something?
[281:58.69]And you know what?
[281:59.97]Whoever did it didn't even think to look in his wall safe.
[282:03.90]I killed him.
[282:05.04]Stop on buying it.
[282:05.98]Okay, well, whatever.
[282:07.82]This door's locked.
[282:09.46]Let's go give the doctor the medicine.
[282:15.57]Yeah, if you try to take the glue, he stops you and he says, hey, hey, wait a minute.
[282:18.41]You gotta give me some collateral and it's gotta be something he wants.
[282:23.85]Let's try giving him some medicine.
[282:28.17]Although I wanted to give that to the dad, but maybe not.
[282:31.72]Okay.
[282:33.10]Aspirin?
[282:34.38]Why should I?
[282:36.00]No.
[282:37.82]Cough medicine?
[282:38.90]Why should I?
[282:42.44]You want a get-out-of-jail-free card, man?
[282:44.68]Vitamins?
[282:45.84]Why should I care?
[282:49.01]You want tampons?
[282:51.09]Tampons.
[282:52.27]Why should I care about...
[282:54.81]I don't have anything he wants.
[282:57.55]Not now.
[282:59.53]Unfortunately.
[283:00.06]There's nothing I can do here?
[283:14.43]Pew.
[283:15.85]Windows.
[283:17.96]Oh, a young man lies motionless in the casket.
[283:20.12]Red stains are visible in his shirt and boots.
[283:22.24]Wait, somebody's in here now?
[283:23.64]God damn it!
[283:24.88]I gotta restart the game.
[283:30.18]Because all the cutscenes are skipping.
[283:32.10]Let's reload the game.
[283:43.09]Every cutscene is skipping, so we have to reload.
[283:50.93]Give me one sec.
[283:58.12]Should be working now.
[284:00.86]That's the thought.
[284:05.46]Yes.
[284:10.73]Alright.
[284:12.79]Welcome back.
[284:17.83]This is not in the right spot.
[284:18.99]This is actually in the complete opposite spot.
[284:20.77]This is not in the correct spot.
[284:27.53]What is going on here?
[284:28.85]There it is.
[284:29.82]Okay.
[284:30.14]Now we can see.
[284:33.18]Load game.
[284:38.70]Which one of these was it?
[284:39.70]I killed the guy.
[284:40.38]God damn it.
[284:40.94]This is the one.
[284:43.00]Control F4.
[284:44.73]And left click.
[284:56.48]Well, it's gonna keep skipping it, apparently.
[285:01.46]Is there any way I can stop that from happening in DOSBox?
[285:07.77]Anybody know how to do that?
[285:08.51]Because that's been happening.
[285:12.63]Shit seems to be all fucked up.
[285:17.93]Reload further back?
[285:18.66]I don't think that'll help.
[285:21.62]Maybe that's the whole cutscene.
[285:25.60]You know, you might be right.
[285:28.74]Oh, there's a person in there.
[285:33.28]Oh, that's the guy that died.
[285:34.90]What does he say?
[285:39.64]Let me read this real quick.
[285:42.24]... ...
[285:56.08]Save the CPU cycles.
[285:57.58]Alright, this might take a second here.
[285:58.94]Let me give you one minute.
[286:03.62]One second.
[286:08.72]I need to open up, because it's apparently some kind of issue with the DOS box.
[286:14.68]So hold on one moment.
[286:20.31]What the fuck is it right here?
[286:28.18]Uh-huh.
[286:29.72]Uh-huh.
[286:35.16]There it is.
[286:35.82]Harvester.
[286:40.76]DOSBox.
[286:42.33]Let's see what they say.
[286:50.25]There it is.
[286:50.73]I'll need to open this with Notepad.
[286:57.56]And scroll down to the CPU paragraph.
[287:05.19]You got it.
[287:06.87]CPU cycles max limit.
[287:11.53]Change it to CPU cycles max limit 33400.
[287:13.01]33400.
[287:13.07]Save config.
[287:13.41]Okay, save.
[287:13.75]Let's give it a try.
[287:29.95]Let's give it a go.
[287:32.21]Hopefully it worked.
[287:36.01]Okay, open this.
[287:43.80]And away we go.
[287:45.72]Come on.
[287:47.58]Work.
[287:51.63]Watch the game not even load.
[287:52.61]I'd be so angry.
[287:54.87]I would be unhappy.
[287:55.63]Alright, here we go.
[288:06.21]Load game.
[288:07.33]Get in here.
[288:07.95]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[288:10.22]Please wait.
[288:10.78]I know it's not in the correct spot on the screen.
[288:13.06]That's alright.
[288:13.68]It will be in a second.
[288:16.90]Or maybe it won't.
[288:18.70]Oh lord, what happened here?
[288:19.66]There we go.
[288:20.08]Okay.
[288:23.03]Exit.
[288:25.19]Load game.
[288:28.19]God damn it.
[288:30.21]Control F4.
[288:30.75]Click.
[288:31.73]Click.
[288:44.28]Well... We're seeing at least the major cutscenes that matter, so... Change it to 20,000?
[288:55.93]Mmm... Oh well.
[289:08.18]F11 and F12 Jerma hotkeys to change the cycles.
[289:12.93]20,000 apparently works, F11.
[289:14.39]Won't hurt to try.
[289:21.54]The main cutscenes, like intercourse.
[289:24.84]Let's just keep going.
[289:30.36]I still don't know what the next step is to get this rolling, to get it to be nighttime.
[289:39.08]Take a picture of the guy in the casket?
[289:40.38]That's not a bad idea.
[289:43.99]Not a bad idea.
[289:47.65]You know what?
[289:48.47]Let's do this.
[289:49.67]I'm going to go to the bathroom one more time, and I'm going to come back.
[289:52.81]And hopefully we can get close to the end of the game.
[289:55.97]I'll be right back.
[289:57.88]Stay tuned.
[289:59.20]One last pee.
[290:01.08]Get one last pee out of your system before I come back.
[290:03.36]I'll be right back.
[291:12.84]Yeah.
[291:57.19]you
[292:35.08]okay I am back I have returned well not really but kind of oh let me wear my headphones
[293:06.54]uh alright so somebody said somebody said to take a picture of the guy in the casket so that's what we're going to try we're going to attempt that this back hey how are you fix the hair hair looks a little it looks a little dingy right now looks like who cares
[293:36.43]Alright, let's take a picture of it.
[293:40.27]Uh, where's the morgue?
[293:41.47]Morgue.
[293:45.31]Did he actually say why he streamed this long?
[293:47.83]I made up a going all night joke.
[293:49.97]And, I mean, it is like 2 o'clock in the morning.
[293:53.05]Yeah, you know what?
[293:54.93]Like, it is really fucking late.
[293:56.99]And, like, there are people that are staying up really fucking late.
[294:00.15]Let's, like, actually, I mean, 2 or 3 a.m.
[294:03.24]is all night.
[294:05.81]That's getting into the morning.
[294:08.20]Let's take a picture of the corpse.
[294:12.74]I thought it was like 1230 or something.
[294:15.32]For some reason.
[294:19.04]Let's get a picture of that casket.
[294:21.58]There it is.
[294:22.99]And then go talk to this guy and blackmail him, right?
[294:31.73]I don't see no sun.
[294:33.07]Not yet.
[294:36.25]Oh.
[294:38.27]Okay, well, this guy's body has scratches all over it.
[294:42.13]So let's see if I can get the glue here.
[294:45.35]Ah, you've taken up photography.
[294:46.85]There we go.
[294:47.31]Perfect.
[294:47.55]It worked.
[294:48.41]Now why on Earth would you choose such a grotesque subject?
[294:51.89]That John Doe you've got boxed up in the chapel?
[294:54.69]He didn't just drop dead.
[294:56.71]Someone helped him take the plunge.
[294:59.42]Don't until the sun is up you Austin.
[295:01.48]I mean I am like mortician not a medical examiner Yeah, I don't know about that man that being ripped a shred two or three o'clock Eastern is like is my limit This is not something you want to be looking into young man No shit is gonna find out who I am and get the hell out of here Is that a threat I got the goods on you not vice-versa got the goods have you?
[295:23.63]You're in harvest my young friend Have you tried the road out of town yet?
[295:28.57]I?
[295:29.78]Do so and you may question exactly who has who.
[295:33.18]I have a long way to go.
[295:35.56]That's why I don't want to.
[295:37.10]That's why I don't think I want to do it.
[295:38.80]Because it's going to be like another seven and a half hours.
[295:42.13]I've told you all I can.
[295:42.83]It'll be like ten o'clock in the morning.
[295:44.39]My losses have been substantial of late so I can't offer you money.
[295:48.27]I can give you glue.
[295:49.31]The only thing I can give you in exchange for the photographs is my tube of astro glue.
[295:55.29]Astro glue.
[295:55.95]I do suggest you take it.
[295:58.60]Glue, huh?
[295:59.38]Alright, it's a trade.
[296:00.64]A wise decision.
[296:02.64]When a wasp's nest is stirred up, it is seldom the wasps who grieve later.
[296:07.14]Alright, give me the glue.
[296:10.76]Did I get it?
[296:13.20]Astro glue.
[296:16.08]Now take this to... I'm going to assume the wasp nest.
[296:19.86]Huh?
[296:22.94]I would assume.
[296:24.02]Right?
[296:24.22]I don't know.
[296:30.38]You just woke up to a stream.
[296:31.92]Well, that means it's really late.
[296:33.60]Nightfall descends.
[296:34.28]Here we go.
[296:34.64]Time to burn down the diner.
[296:36.94]Let's at least burn the diner down.
[296:51.92]We already know what it looks like.
[296:53.38]Okay, the diner.
[296:58.03]Head on in.
[296:59.30]The diners are locked.
[297:02.32]What?
[297:03.94]Smash the door.
[297:06.74]Do I have to do the tape gag again?
[297:08.42]Of course I do.
[297:13.02]Okay.
[297:16.20]Burn this place to the ground.
[297:17.82]Save it.
[297:18.12]Okay.
[297:28.09]The goal before going to bed is burn down the diner.
[297:31.41]So, matches.
[297:33.77]Matches on the grease fire.
[297:35.41]Where is it?
[297:36.05]Open the grease fire.
[297:36.93]Okay.
[297:38.68]Now, toss in matches.
[297:43.20]One major deterrent to the art of arson is to make sure no fire alarms are functional.
[297:50.85]Somebody pick up that fucking telephone.
[298:03.57]Fire alarm.
[298:04.89]Where's the fire alarm?
[298:05.75]There it is.
[298:06.37]Examine the smoke alarm.
[298:09.58]Ladder to the smoke alarm.
[298:11.84]Oh, man.
[298:12.92]Oh, man.
[298:13.84]What do I need to do with this smoke alarm?
[298:17.58]Smash it with something?
[298:18.42]Throw something at it?
[298:20.86]How do I break the smoke?
[298:21.76]The glue?
[298:22.30]Put some glue in it?
[298:23.91]Gunk it up?
[298:24.73]Damn it.
[298:29.11]Stick a tampon in there?
[298:30.31]Damn it.
[298:35.54]Well, that didn't work.
[298:36.56]Can't hit it with the axe.
[298:39.68]Tape it up.
[298:40.84]Well, that didn't work.
[298:41.74]It's not gonna work.
[298:46.25]Okay.
[298:47.25]Screwdriver?
[298:48.27]Like, unscrew it and take out the battery?
[298:51.79]Well, that didn't work.
[298:54.75]Set the alarm on fire.
[298:57.82]That would be pretty cheeky.
[299:01.30]Okay.
[299:01.48]Okay.
[299:05.14]Yeah, the ladder doesn't work.
[299:06.78]At least, it doesn't seem like it does.
[299:08.70]Use the ladder on the smoke alarm.
[299:10.32]No.
[299:15.69]How do I cover it?
[299:20.63]Aspirin?
[299:21.11]No.
[299:22.49]Cough medicine?
[299:23.11]Vitamins?
[299:23.61]No.
[299:23.93]Does it combine something?
[299:26.51]Ladder on the tape?
[299:28.30]No.
[299:38.44]I have no idea.
[299:50.73]I think somebody just got it.
[299:53.23]Somebody just screamed in chat and I got it.
[299:55.33]Where's the cake?
[299:59.93]Somebody said, the cake cover.
[300:03.39]Oh God, how would you even see that shit?
[300:05.09]Right on there.
[300:06.03]Okay.
[300:07.07]Cake cover and the tape.
[300:08.75]Well, that didn't work.
[300:11.01]Well, that didn't work.
[300:12.29]Oh, come on.
[300:14.44]The cake cover.
[300:16.50]Tape.
[300:17.86]Cake cover.
[300:18.54]Okay.
[300:19.62]Cake.
[300:21.66]Use the... Cover it with the... Do like the reverse restaurant thing.
[300:25.28]Well, that didn't work.
[300:31.84]Glue in the cake?
[300:34.36]Well, that didn't work.
[300:36.64]You apply the glue to the rim.
[300:38.16]Okay, there it is.
[300:39.12]Finally, the throw-off bucket.
[300:40.90]Done.
[300:41.70]Burn this place to the ground.
[300:44.64]Throw in the matches.
[300:46.32]Sayonara.
[300:48.31]Alright.
[300:49.75]Now what?
[300:50.25]The grease fire is on.
[300:52.45]So now just leave, right?
[300:55.51]Yes, I probably should leave.
[300:58.77]Okay.
[301:00.03]With Edna's Diner ablaze, your task is complete.
[301:01.90]You carefully make your way home to avoid any possible witnesses.
[301:08.66]That's it, I win.
[301:10.00]I get to become part of the cult now, right?
[301:16.28]We don't need to watch this.
[301:19.80]Alright.
[301:20.40]I didn't even go to the bake sale!
[301:24.52]Shit.
[301:24.78]Alright, let's just see what our reward is.
[301:31.52]I didn't- Go get the paper.
[301:35.12]Fuck it, I didn't- I can't believe I didn't bake sale.
[301:38.58]I'm like annoyed by that.
[301:40.15]I kind of want to go back and do the bake sale.
[301:42.89]Hey Steve, you've been doing it.
[301:45.75]Alright, let's go.
[301:49.35]Let's just, okay, let's see where we are here.
[301:53.25]TNA's diner.
[301:56.04]She hung herself as soon as she realized what had happened to her beloved establishment.
[302:05.07]So I don't have to even do anything if people die, even if I don't do anything.
[302:11.06]I had no idea she'd do that.
[302:12.30]Proof music, worthy candidate.
[302:28.83]To hell with this, I'm no longer interested.
[302:30.21]Candidate, I thought this was the initiation.
[302:33.08]This was only a trial to determine your worthiness for testing.
[302:39.00]Your initiation into the mysteries of the harvest will soon begin.
[302:44.88]In the meantime, be patient.
[302:45.94]Patient protocols must be observed before initiation.
[302:48.18]How I recognize this sign.
[302:50.48]You will know when you see it again.
[302:54.52]So that was off on nothing.
[302:57.68]Did we just beat the tutorial?
[302:59.72]Alright, let's go to the diner.
[303:03.52]Now this place is fucked up.
[303:16.58]What?
[303:17.08]Wait, why?
[303:17.90]Why?
[303:18.16]Why is there?
[303:19.00]What is this?
[303:28.78]Why would she be there too?
[303:32.21]Jesus Christ.
[303:33.25]Alright, uh, ladies and gentlemen.
[303:51.80]Thank you all so much for watching.
[303:53.86]I really appreciate it.
[304:00.34]Yeah, we're going to call it here.
[304:02.98]I am like 60% of the way through the game.
[304:05.26]We're going to finish Harvester.
[304:06.86]We will.
[304:10.58]We've been going for about six and a half hours now.
[304:14.22]I said all night, like a couple hours ago, but it's getting real fucking late.
[304:21.68]I'm seeing in the chat a lot of people are like, I'm fucking going to bed, and I probably should too.
[304:27.87]So, um... The next scheduled stream is for Tuesday, but we're gonna go earlier than that.
[304:35.00]I will probably stream... Well, Condemn 2, like, the whole reason why we turned the stream on in the first place today was to play Condemn 2.
[304:42.65]So... Condemn 2 is... I'm gonna have to go get a regular PlayStation 3 controller over the weekend.
[304:51.03]And... I would say... Tomorrow is Saturday, Sunday, so Monday...
[304:58.36]Monday we're going to beat this.
[305:03.36]We're going to complete this game on Monday.
[305:05.04]So like Monday, somewhere Monday night.
[305:07.72]I don't know exactly when, but after like six or seven o'clock, we'll finish this on Monday.
[305:13.64]And then on Tuesday, we will like do, we'll start Condemned 2 again with a proper fucking controller.
[305:21.07]So I think that makes the most sense to me.
[305:25.27]So we'll finish Harvester.
[305:26.65]It's probably like another four or five hours of Harvester, I would assume.
[305:31.37]And then bonus Halloween week, yeah.
[305:34.56]And then Tuesday, Condemned 2.
[305:35.98]That sounds good to me.
[305:38.32]Alright, that's going to be it.
[305:40.10]Let me just say there was a bunch of bits that I missed and I'm going to get to them.
[305:45.28]So let's just say our goodbyes from here.
[305:49.07]Thanks for sticking around, everybody.
[305:51.01]See you on Monday.
[305:53.66]Let's turn this... Let's get this saved and then turn it off.
[306:01.99]Save game.
[306:03.63]Again, I want to... Sorry, I apologize for, again, the kind of the first like 45 minutes of the stream being all over the place.
[306:13.09]But there's no real way for me to know that that was going to happen.
[306:20.34]But, you know, that still annoys me.
[306:23.96]I'm gonna have one of these staves be start here Monday, dude.
[306:29.64]That's how I know it's the right one.
[306:33.05]Alright, quit game.
[306:33.75]Okay.
[306:35.61]So... This is BRB.
[306:38.67]This is not the correct thing.
[306:39.53]There it is.
[306:40.15]Hi.
[306:43.29]So I'm gonna go for some bits.
[306:44.91]Have a good night, everybody.
[306:49.23]See you all.

[307:06.22]Well, thank you, Sticks.
[307:09.50]That game was outrageous.
[307:11.98]Now I know why everyone was saying, play Harvester.
[307:14.00]It's insanity.

[308:46.07]That already is funny, so thanks, man.
[308:48.79]Topac, thanks for the $10.
[308:52.06]They say, finish her.
[308:54.80]I don't know who they were responding to, but thanks for the ten bucks, dude.
[308:58.66]Ten dollars.
[309:00.50]Much appreciated.
[309:01.72]I must have axed somebody in the head.
[309:06.18]When is somebody going to tell me that O.W.O.
[309:07.77]does not?
[309:08.99]I know, but I'm going to call it Owlface.
[309:12.17]Because that's what it looks like.
[309:15.75]Fourth consecutive lion.
[309:19.69]There's the... No, you give two.
[309:22.49]Okay, I see.
[309:23.97]So thanks for the $9 and then $1, so there's $10.
[309:27.83]So fourth consecutive line, thank you for the $10 total, and they say, I just want you to know how much all you've done has meant to me.
[309:33.22]I've followed you since the regular TF2 days, and I've always looked forward to your uploads and streams.
[309:37.98]I feel like you and those you associate with and influence are a big part of why I still carry on.
[309:44.10]I consider every cent I've contributed more than worth it, and expect more in the future.
[309:48.55]Smiley face.
[309:51.89]Well... I... All I can say, guys, for real... Is... I... I don't even know about the word influence, right?
[310:08.70]Influence and... The way that I act, the way that I am... If you take something from me or I take something from you guys... In regards to social stuff and... Influencing your behavior or my behavior...
[310:22.96]I don't even know if I would consider myself an influence.
[310:26.18]I think that we all just kind of enjoy being here.
[310:29.21]And we all enjoy doing this.
[310:30.89]It's fun for everybody.
[310:32.91]I don't want to ever have you guys look at me as some... Mr. Influence.
[310:38.39]Mr. Pedestal.
[310:41.08]As much as we joke around on streams about it.
[310:43.82]I don't want anyone to ever think that of me.
[310:47.90]I'd rather you see me as like...
[310:50.80]just somebody that you can watch and like we can have fun and we can make jokes at I mean a lot of times at my expense but that's for fun you know I don't like you know yeah of course I do I think I'm a fucking handsome extremely talented person no um hearing that the people when people say that like I influence them and I'm like one of the reasons why they you know they still watch streams and there's it's a lot it's a lot to take in
[311:20.65]Because I consider myself just like kind of a regular person.
[311:25.41]I see you as an awesome dude.
[311:26.31]Your humor is gold.
[311:27.11]But like, my humor just stems from me observing things that I think are stupid or funny or interesting.
[311:33.49]And if you guys agree with it, then we all think it's funny.
[311:38.99]We all can come together and laugh at a joke.
[311:40.93]And you guys make fucking tons of jokes.
[311:43.51]I look over at this chat and it makes me laugh my ass off all the time.
[311:48.58]Don't underestimate your own humor, because there's been some shit in this chat that I've read that has been absolutely fucking hysterical.
[311:59.85]Remember, I'm just a guy.
[312:00.69]A super fucking handsome guy.
[312:06.76]You understand?
[312:07.40]Oops.
[312:17.94]Wrong camera.
[312:20.58]Anyways.
[312:22.56]I'll move that out of the way.
[312:28.48]Thank you, Kilganon.
[312:29.46]Thank you, Corvid.
[312:30.46]Thank you, Topac.
[312:31.16]Thank you.
[312:31.50]Fourth consecutive line.
[312:32.48]That was from you.
[312:34.24]Here's the rest I meant to give.
[312:35.18]That was ten bucks total.
[312:36.56]Thanks a lot.
[312:39.05]Sticks.
[312:39.59]Renegade also gave a dollar.
[312:40.65]Spoiler alert.
[312:42.35]If I recall correctly, in the Misery book, she cuts off his leg.
[312:52.17]Whatever.
[312:54.67]That's one less vote.
[313:01.06]I'm gonna get fucking 600 million.
[313:03.08]What's one less vote for the other guy?
[313:05.20]I don't give a shoot, you know?
[313:09.10]I do.
[313:10.83]Please, please God, vote for me in that fucking election.
[313:13.35]It's the only thing I fucking care about.
[313:15.67]Is there a Twitch-like election?
[313:18.74]Is that a thing?
[313:21.14]Does twitch.tv do like a... Twitchies!
[313:24.28]It probably will.
[313:27.02]It'll be like, newest influential startup streamer!
[313:30.06]And it'll be like fucking... I don't know, I'm just gonna say... How was I gonna say a name there?
[313:34.54]I was gonna say a random fucking name.
[313:37.94]President of Twitch.
[313:44.98]Anyways.
[313:47.06]Uh...
[313:48.57]Kilgannon, thanks for the $1.
[313:50.49]You turn off your webcam, I die.
[313:52.77]Well, I didn't.
[313:53.21]It was on the whole time.
[313:54.99]Colin Jets, thanks for the $10.
[313:56.75]Shut up and take my money.
[313:58.05]You got it.
[313:59.05]That was from earlier.
[313:59.67]I think I already read this one.
[314:00.87]But, are you sure?
[314:01.68]I will shut up.
[314:07.14]Kilgannon, thanks for the $2.
[314:08.52]Jeremy, if you're good at video games, then you'll be able to beat getting over it.
[314:11.72]If you beat it, I'll give you $20.
[314:15.52]Isn't getting over it, like, fucking impossible?
[314:18.48]Haven't only, like, 16 people beaten that game?
[314:22.69]I keep, like, watching clips of people fall from a very high height, and the tagline is, so-and-so-and-so-and-so wasted three and a half hours and has to start over.
[314:35.00]Is that what that game is?
[314:35.68]I don't know if I'm going to be keen on that.
[314:37.68]We'll see.
[314:40.62]Anyways, thank you, Mocha, for the bits.
[314:45.08]Who else do we miss here from earlier?
[314:46.88]I think I already got Mr. Wolfgang for $5 from a couple hours ago.
[314:53.20]I did.
[314:54.14]Who else?
[314:55.74]There's only like another five or six, I think.
[315:01.03]Let's see.
[315:07.92]Uh, here we go.
[315:08.62]Faizarn, thanks for the $3.
[315:11.98]Did you get told that the actor for Steve was actually arrested, IRL, for something really fucked up?
[315:18.37]What, in this game?
[315:20.49]Was there a guy?
[315:20.97]I don't know.
[315:21.55]I have no idea.
[315:25.09]Killganon, thanks again for the $2 or $3 in a row here that says brutal, unbelievable, horrible violence is fine.
[315:31.12]We already touched upon this.
[315:33.58]But thanks a lot, dude.
[315:34.38]Judge Owl, thanks for the dollar.
[315:35.54]Yo, Jerm.
[315:36.58]Damn those commies.
[315:38.74]A reference to the missile launch.
[315:41.02]Thank you, Judge Owl.
[315:44.06]And I think that's getting close here.
[315:53.05]A couple from back here.
[315:55.99]Edgemont gave that $100 earlier, which was fucking insane.
[316:01.39]I'm Mooshow, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[316:02.82]I just say love you.
[316:03.66]We'll write back at you.
[316:05.36]Thank you for the $10.
[316:06.44]Appreciate it.
[316:09.94]So wait, this guy, a guy in this game actually got arrested for like something terrible?
[316:15.13]That's fucked up.
[316:20.61]Moo means moo, thanks for the $15 earlier.
[316:23.47]Well, it's only fair that I pitch in a bit towards that $100 joke.
[316:26.65]Though I'm not as big money as Edgemont, so I hope this will do.
[316:30.25]That stream yesterday was amazing, and I can't wait to watch you play Drunk Asshole Simulator 2008.
[316:33.98]What?
[316:34.58]I don't know what that means.
[316:38.50]Drunk Asshole?
[316:39.72]Oh, that's Condemned 2.
[316:40.92]I get it.
[316:44.35]Thank you, MooMeansMoo, for the 15 bucks.
[316:45.81]Appreciate it.
[316:49.52]Ivory, thanks for the $1.10.
[316:51.32]Hey, Jerma, dodged from your Hand of Fate 2 streams, but I can't thank you enough for recommending this game.
[316:56.73]Based on what I've played and not watching the VODs yet, I predict the Thieves Guild challenge and the Lovers are the most frustrating parts of the game thus far.
[317:04.29]Anyways, thank you for having top-tier video game taste and being an amazing role model.
[317:08.71]Best regards to you.
[317:10.86]Uwo, what's this?
[317:14.42]Uwo, what's this?
[317:16.68]I don't know what that means.
[317:18.32]But thank you, Ivory.
[317:20.75]Hand of Fate 2 is actually like a pretty fantastic fucking game.
[317:26.58]It is very fun, very challenging, very frustrating at times and unfair at times, but that's just kind of the way it goes.
[317:35.29]StixRenegade, thanks for your $1 again, Zumbinis.
[317:38.43]Yeah, we'll get it in there.
[317:39.79]Who knows?
[317:42.45]Copta, thanks for the $10.
[317:43.59]Delayed donation for the Dickie on screen.
[317:47.34]I think that was from yesterday.
[317:49.58]He's referring to yesterday.
[317:52.13]Aleblood, thanks for the five zero cents.
[317:55.55]Fifty cents.
[317:56.09]Jeremiah, I don't have a lot to give, but you mean a lot to me.
[317:58.17]Please get some help.
[317:59.53]We're all worried.
[318:01.37]I don't know what that's referring to, but thank you, Aleblood.
[318:05.53]I'm glad you're around.
[318:10.01]Sixfish11, thank you for the two dollars.
[318:12.73]You should actually play TF2.
[318:16.38]On a rainy day, maybe we'll pop that out.
[318:19.98]It's got to be a really rainy day, though.
[318:21.80]Like, downpour.
[318:23.32]We'll see.
[318:25.46]And I think that's it.
[318:26.48]I think I caught up on the bits.
[318:29.05]Thank you so much to all the new subs, all the resubs.
[318:30.89]You guys are fucking fantastic.
[318:33.17]And I'll see you guys on Monday to complete Harvester.
[318:35.77]Have a safe weekend.
[318:36.49]Have a fun weekend.
[318:39.89]Much love to all of you.
[318:44.93]and oh uh by the way happy veterans day today is uh is veterans day right I think I'm just gonna look it up and double check yeah it is happy veterans day to uh all of our military veterans all our military personnel
[319:12.51]I will see you guys on Monday.
[319:15.55]Take care, everybody.
[319:17.77]See you all soon.
[319:36.04]No, I didn't miss any bits.
[319:37.24]That's right.
[319:37.88]Hold on.
[319:38.24]Hold on.
[319:38.58]Moo means moo.
[319:39.74]$1 two minutes ago.
[319:41.91]Don't worry, Jeremy.
[319:42.81]You do actually have my vote.
[319:43.99]Real talk.
[319:44.43]Thank you so much for the amazing streams.
[319:45.85]They're seriously the thing I look forward to the most during the week.
[319:48.97]Thank you so much for all you do.
[319:50.07]Chat is in heart mode now.
[319:52.41]Yeah, and it doesn't go unnoticed.
[319:53.83]It really doesn't.
[319:57.71]Some people wonder or ask me, why would I do a stream like I did yesterday?
[320:02.15]Why do you do that?
[320:02.75]What was the point of that?
[320:05.23]Because it was, it was, like, fun.
[320:06.67]Like, it was fun just to be, like, for you guys.
[320:09.27]Because you guys are kind of, like, you guys will get it, right?
[320:13.08]You guys, like, will think it's fun and interesting.
[320:15.34]And I think it's fun and interesting.
[320:16.64]Like, the reason why... You know, it's the same thing while, like, fucking the whole stream, like, fucked up earlier this afternoon.
[320:23.48]Like, this afternoon, this night.
[320:27.70]I want, I want to, like, keep everybody engaged and...
[320:32.45]However I can do that, sometimes I fucking fail.
[320:34.83]Sometimes I fuck it up.
[320:35.77]It's gonna happen.
[320:37.48]Sometimes an idea that I come up with is just not worth doing.
[320:40.68]It's not funny and it turns out to be a disaster.
[320:42.78]It happens a lot.
[320:45.26]But... I just know that I'm trying.
[320:49.34]And I appreciate every single fucking one of you guys.
[320:55.63]And... That's really all I can say.
[321:01.33]People looking forward to this stream makes me want to try harder.
[321:04.77]You know?
[321:05.63]When I get messages like this.
[321:08.68]It makes me want to try fucking harder.
[321:10.98]And do something that I haven't done before.
[321:18.81]And it's gonna keep happening.
[321:20.13]As long as I can keep doing it, right?
[321:24.67]You're going to see a lot of fails.
[321:25.57]You're going to see lots of triumphs.
[321:28.45]And I don't want to get into this whole deep conversation shit, but you guys know what I'm talking about.
[321:34.45]If people are still here watching, the stream ended like 30 minutes ago.
[321:39.01]Those of you guys that are still just watching here, sticking around like the 1,200, 1,300 people or so.
[321:47.56]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[321:50.46]I just like to have fun.
[321:52.30]And if you guys are having fun too, then it's a symbiotic mutual relationship.
[321:59.79]Thank you, KillGannon, for the $1.
[322:01.15]Hey, Jerma, just want you to know you're my new main bitch.
[322:03.29]Well, I just read that.
[322:05.31]Thanks.
[322:07.49]Also, Klink gave $1 a few minutes ago as well.
[322:10.25]Good stream.
[322:11.91]I know you think the start was a disaster, but it was a blast.
[322:14.59]Well, at least it was worth watching.
[322:16.69]Alright.
[322:19.07]Uh, playabigdanny.
[322:22.04]Thanks for the $1.
[322:22.74]Thanks for the stream, Jaren.
[322:23.48]Been a while since I last caught your stream live.
[322:26.38]Great work on your streams.
[322:27.38]Greatest streamer ever, period.
[322:29.70]Well, I'm fucking honored that you would even utter those words.
[322:35.49]And to wrap it up, Gaming Trickster and I can knee
[322:41.57]iKiniki.
[322:42.17]Hope I'm saying your name right.
[322:43.97]Thanks for keeping me up till 8am.
[322:45.43]Love you, thank you for everything.
[322:47.21]I'm sorry you're up till 8.
[322:48.31]This is why I wanted to end the stream like an hour ago.
[322:49.98]And then I was like, all night!
[322:51.36]Like a fucking idiot.
[322:55.42]Good night, everybody.
[322:56.00]I'll see you on Monday.
[322:57.82]Be well.
[322:59.85]Be well.
