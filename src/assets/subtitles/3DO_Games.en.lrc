[00:00.65]Somebody in chat owes somebody $20.
[00:02.05]I gotta be right off the bat, gotta tell you right immediately.
[00:06.89]Somebody in chat bet, somebody in chat, I think, somebody else, that I wasn't going to be able to capture this.
[00:14.46]And they thought this is going to be a disaster stream where I could not cap the 3DO.
[00:19.56]Well, I am sad to say to that person, we're ready to go.
[00:23.56]It's good.
[00:24.10]It looks great.
[00:26.52]It is working flawlessly, actually.
[00:35.12]But today we're going to 3DO.
[00:36.30]Welcome everybody.
[00:36.86]I'm excited for this.
[00:37.74]I've been waiting to do this for a long time.
[00:39.24]I've owned this for almost a year.
[00:43.79]I've been collecting 3DO games in anticipation for this very moment today.
[00:52.17]Do we need proof?
[00:53.33]I mean, okay, I can give you proof.
[00:56.19]I mean, it's, I got, I got a 3DO.
[00:59.03]Crying out loud.
[01:03.48]This is not on an emulator, this is actually... I'm gonna give a shoutout here.
[01:08.51]When there's a shitload of people here, because I wanna shout this company out, because they- this thing works!
[01:13.75]It works very well, and I wanna shoutout that company!
[01:26.00]I've used the kind of old console converting upscaling hardware before.
[01:32.46]And this one is the best that I have personally used.
[01:39.03]Wouldn't you like to know what it is?
[01:41.19]You'll find out.
[01:44.57]Once there's more than a thousand people here.
[01:46.77]So I can show that I said to more than a thousand people.
[01:50.63]The most amount of people were here.
[01:52.79]And I said it.
[02:00.61]No, it's a RetroTINK.
[02:03.59]The RetroTINK 2X Pro.
[02:07.23]Thing is amazing.
[02:08.97]It was the easiest thing I've ever used in my life.
[02:11.52]I just plugged everything I needed to plug in in.
[02:13.56]I downloaded some updated firmware.
[02:15.40]Flashed it.
[02:17.06]It's ready to use.
[02:17.60]And it looks way better than anything else I've ever used.
[02:20.00]It's the RetroTINK.
[02:24.67]You want to use original hardware and you have an HDTV?
[02:26.98]Get a RetroTink 2X Pro.
[02:30.28]And tell them Jerma985 sent you.
[02:34.02]Who cares?
[02:36.36]No, it's actually really great.
[02:37.50]And you're going to see what the picture looks like right now.
[02:43.77]Hey, look at that.
[02:45.95]Hey, look at that.
[02:47.15]3DO on original hardware.
[02:55.21]So many residents sleepered.
[03:00.02]Whatever.
[03:01.12]This is big to me.
[03:02.10]This is a big deal for me.
[03:05.64]You haven't even shown it yet.
[03:06.52]Well, hold on.
[03:07.20]Let's restart this.
[03:10.16]You haven't shown it yet.
[03:11.38]Look.
[03:15.11]Ow.
[03:20.03]Turn my heart.
[03:20.59]Turn my heart.
[03:21.73]It looks great.
[03:22.27]I know.
[03:22.49]It looks awesome.
[03:27.02]Show us the console.
[03:28.41]Alright, hold on.
[03:29.03]Let me show you the console.
[03:37.92]I don't... Whatever.
[03:52.76]It's, um, whatever.
[03:53.60]I have, I have, I had a fucking tank.
[03:55.30]I had a tube top on, alright?
[03:56.86]I had a tube top on that went like this.
[04:03.71]When, when you have to delay your audio and video on OBS...
[04:09.45]happens is it doesn't matter if fucking hours have passed.
[04:12.69]A whole day could pass.
[04:13.95]If you didn't close OBS, it saves the last frame that you did.
[04:20.16]And when you're setting shit up, sometimes you just don't even think about it.
[04:22.66]I'm just happy that you didn't see my dick.
[04:24.85]I'm just telling you a fact.
[04:26.01]I'm just happy that that's not what happened.
[04:30.98]Oh, yeah, that's fine.
[04:32.99]Look, I'm fine.
[04:34.59]Alright, anyways, what am I doing?
[04:37.45]I'm showing you.
[04:38.03]Okay, so watch.
[04:38.95]I'll show you for an example.
[04:43.75]An hour can go by, and that's going to save there because I've delayed the video.
[04:54.00]Was he wearing pants?
[04:56.62]Yes, I was.
[04:57.97]I remember wearing pants.
[04:59.81]Don't worry.
[05:02.77]Okay, you know that photo of me playing TF2 with just like a bare chest?
[05:08.47]That just happened.
[05:10.00]I don't care.
[05:11.08]I don't even care, okay?
[05:12.82]I don't even care.
[05:13.86]Even if I was naked, I wouldn't even care.
[05:17.56]Even if I was naked, I wouldn't even care.
[05:18.84]I would just be like, whatever.
[05:20.41]I don't even care.
[05:20.91]Okay, let's show this thing.
[05:24.81]There's the whole setup.
[05:35.16]So what we have here... Here is the... Here is the... Well, that's a controller.
[05:40.42]There's the controller.

[05:47.02]There it is.
[05:47.92]The 3DO.
[05:50.12]The Panasonic FZ-10 3DO.
[05:54.06]Connected to... A RetroTank 2X Pro.

[06:08.41]I'm not gonna break this thing.
[06:09.31]This thing's awesome.
[06:13.01]Why would I break it?
[06:17.30]That was pre-recorded footage.
[06:18.70]Or even if that, okay.
[06:20.00]Even if that was pre-recorded footage, who cares?
[06:22.09]I own the console and it's plugged in.
[06:23.81]Does it really matter?
[06:26.49]think I went through all the trouble to plug in all this stuff and like set it all up just to take a video of it I mean that's next level I I see here we go alright let's go no more stalling time for 3do let's restart the program I'm so excited ladies and gentlemen rebel assault Star Wars for the 3do I am not seeing even nearly enough hype right now

[07:57.31]I'm so excited.
[07:58.45]I'm so excited for 3 CBD, yo.
[08:02.80]Wait, did I even have to do that?
[08:03.62]I didn't even have to do that.
[08:12.79]I didn't, I really actually didn't even need to turn it off.
[08:15.65]Will you, oh, here we go.
[08:16.53]Shh.
[08:17.69]Quiet.
[08:29.72]Yes!
[08:29.94]That video is so good.
[08:33.38]144p video file.
[08:58.63]It's Luke!
[08:58.85]I know Luke!
[08:59.23]By the way, this whole thing was made in MS Paint.
[09:01.65]It probably was, if I'll be honest.
[09:03.86]It probably was.
[09:04.72]3D Movie Maker, actually.
[09:30.67]We can talk all the shit that we want.
[09:32.41]It actually looks pretty good.
[09:34.60]Considering that it is an upscaled image of like 140 or like 240p or something.
[09:38.36]Looks pretty damn good.
[09:42.04]It'd look a lot worse.
[09:43.66]Alright, I'm ready.
[09:46.30]Let's go.
[09:46.66]Alright, I'm done stalling.
[09:47.96]Let's play.
[09:57.10]It is morning at a rebel base on planet Tatooine, where a young pilot is embarking on a crucial training flight.
[10:03.25]Smells pretty good.
[10:04.19]For a pile of crap.
[10:08.41]Did I sneeze?
[10:10.75]What was that?
[10:14.06]Rookie one to TACCOM Control.
[10:17.58]Request clearance for departure.
[10:20.62]This is TACCOM Control.
[10:22.06]Clearance granted.
[10:22.88]Is that you, kid?
[10:23.96]Yeah.
[10:24.39]Back!
[10:25.83]So unsettling.
[10:26.19]I love it, though.
[10:27.21]Alright, so in Rebels... I don't play this.
[10:28.49]It's a T-Rex.
[10:28.83]Oh, no.
[10:28.99]We're flying out of the canyon.
[10:30.16]Never mind.
[10:30.50]I thought it was a T-Rex.
[10:31.44]Sorry.
[10:47.86]Okay, steer clear.
[10:48.56]You have to fly?
[10:49.28]Alright, I'm actually flying.
[10:51.54]Wow, this is awesome.
[10:52.32]This definitely wasn't the trailer for the 3DO.
[10:55.72]There's no way it wasn't.
[10:57.16]Alright, it's a little tight.
[10:58.28]It's kind of hard to tell.
[11:18.29]Orc in the cannon.
[11:18.79]Let's go right.
[11:19.13]I'm a true hotshot, man.
[11:20.50]Holy shit.
[11:20.76]I am!
[11:20.94]Why would you bring the trainee here?
[11:21.88]This doesn't seem very safe.
[11:51.20]Okay, Trady.
[11:53.70]You don't know how to fly planes yet, but just do this hard shit.
[11:56.73]I'm doing it.
[12:03.77]That guy was trying to kill me.
[12:05.77]This guy wants me dead.
[12:06.67]Alright, so far so good.
[12:12.53]Rookie one, we're approaching a fork in the canyon.
[12:14.91]Green two will go left.
[12:16.45]You can go with him, but if you're really a hotshot, follow me to the right.
[12:20.91]No!
[12:20.99]It's too tight.
[12:21.47]Did I fly up with him?
[12:50.92]I'm so excited.
[12:52.07]I can't wait to play.
[12:53.43]There's 40 games.
[12:54.61]I have 43 video games.
[12:56.15]I'm so excited.
[12:57.05]Shoot at the targets?
[12:59.17]Wait, what?
[13:16.82]I got him.
[13:17.62]Wait, was that my friend?
[13:18.46]Wait, did I shoot one of the good guys?
[13:21.63]Stay tight, follower lead, and stay clear of the walls.
[13:28.43]Oh my god, I can do the whole thing.
[13:30.45]Okay.
[13:30.81]I'm gonna go left this time because I want it to be really easy.
[13:44.11]That was friendly fire.
[13:45.35]I'm going left.
[13:46.07]Forget about going right.
[13:50.55]No.
[13:51.22]No, I don't want to be a hotshot.
[13:52.42]I just want to be a regular guy.
[13:54.68]I went left.
[13:56.08]I held.
[13:57.70]My ship was tilting left.
[13:58.88]It's forcing me to go right.
[14:00.16]Easy now.
[14:03.48]Now pull hard over.
[14:05.14]Now the other way.
[14:11.51]It's okay, I got plenty of health.
[14:14.91]Okay, now this time it's like a top-down view.
[14:16.83]Alright, don't screw this up.
[14:22.49]Is it actually a loser of choice?
[14:24.98]It might be.
[14:26.68]Stay with us.
[14:27.52]Okay.
[14:52.60]What the fuck happened?
[14:56.39]No, dude, that's not even... what?
[14:58.47]No, I don't wanna... It's very weird.
[15:00.87]I don't understand.
[15:12.92]When do I get the lightsaber?
[15:14.34]Do you get a lightsaber in this game?
[15:15.68]You get a lightsaber, right?
[15:16.68]You have to.
[15:17.84]It's a Star Wars game.
[15:18.74]I have to beat this.
[15:19.38]Left.
[15:19.48]Yeah.
[15:19.66]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:20.96]I want as much health as possible.
[15:23.08]I have to beat this.
[15:43.83]This is harder than the other one.
[15:44.79]Okay, don't mess this up.
[15:49.60]They fly- shoot the drones.
[15:51.32]Okay, I tried.
[15:54.80]Alright, I'm gonna fucking sit up.
[16:02.45]Watch the pillars?
[16:03.33]Pillars?
[16:11.82]Okay, pillars.
[16:13.44]Oh shit!
[16:14.80]Okay.
[16:16.06]Alright, that's it?
[16:19.00]What's a bugs fight?
[16:21.70]Fuck, I ran into it.
[16:40.58]Shit!
[16:40.94]I just crashed into it again.
[16:42.10]Okay, it's hard to see.
[16:45.00]Fuck!
[16:45.36]It's- okay, just stay away from the shadows.
[16:50.96]Oh fuck!
[16:52.11]Alright, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[17:02.25]No way!
[17:10.48]Alright, I can't lose my mind.
[17:11.70]I cannot lose... Wait, I'm just dead.
[17:17.62]They're leaving me for dead.
[17:22.70]Oh, I got game over.
[17:23.50]Alright, I'm going... No, it's not even worth pointing my name in.
[17:32.15]That was just a warm-up.
[17:32.89]That was a warm-up.
[17:33.63]That was a warm-up.
[17:34.37]Ready?
[17:34.63]I'm ready.
[17:35.21]That was a warm-up.
[17:37.37]Alright, somebody just go get the password for after this level if I can't do it.
[17:42.53]That was a warm-up.
[17:45.67]What is this?
[17:46.20]Rookie 1 is... Dialogues and text volumes at a difficulty is normal.
[17:52.56]That's kind of cool.
[17:56.46]Everything's right here.
[17:57.14]Alright, let's go.
[18:00.32]Oh.
[18:20.68]This is so fun, though.
[18:22.06]It's just... I love it.
[18:23.64]I don't care if I lose here a thousand times.
[18:25.68]I'm holding a 3DO controller in my hand.
[18:27.26]That's all I care about.
[18:27.88]This song doesn't match.
[18:28.68]I'm crashing the bridge.
[18:49.03]Okay.
[18:49.53]Don't mess it up.
[18:50.57]Just avoid the pillars and don't even... Who cares about shooting the drones?
[18:58.20]Alright.
[18:58.88]Go!
[19:06.19]Who gives a shit about the Google Earth image that's underneath you?
[19:16.25]Is that a shadow?
[19:20.07]Okay, watch out, watch out!
[19:25.39]Is this a wall?
[19:49.24]Who cares?
[19:49.72]Just let him go.
[19:51.18]I got no damage done to me.
[19:52.67]Doesn't matter.
[19:53.41]None of this matters.
[19:54.17]Just live.
[19:54.45]Where are they?
[19:55.09]Alright, I did it!
[19:55.55]I got a password.
[20:16.96]Part one, path taken easy.
[20:18.48]Password, Bothan.
[20:24.26]Yes.
[20:25.17]Let's go.
[20:25.73]Keep going.
[20:26.15]After two, asteroid field training.
[20:29.75]Rookie one, this is Commander Farrell.
[20:31.81]Report in.
[20:33.05]Rookie one, standing by, Commander.
[20:35.29]Alright.
[20:35.83]Before we begin, let's get something straight.
[20:37.94]I don't like hot shots.
[20:39.56]If you want to impress me, show me control and discipline.
[20:44.35]I'm not like my twin brother, Dave.
[20:47.65]I don't like hot shots.
[20:48.60]He likes them.
[20:49.40]Don't try to prove anything to me.
[20:52.02]Sick.
[20:52.26]What happened?
[20:52.60]I can't fly.
[21:17.14]You guys know the number munchers?
[21:18.68]Or was it math blasters?
[21:20.82]One of them.
[21:28.81]Get out of the fucking way.
[21:35.47]Dodge!
[21:37.09]Dodge!
[21:43.30]Shit, there's a lot of them coming.
[21:45.21]Down?
[21:46.09]Alright, we're good.
[21:51.01]We're good, we're good, we're fine, we're fine.
[21:52.83]Perfect.
[22:01.14]Not bad, Rookie One.
[22:02.38]Looks like you can fly after all.
[22:04.52]Thanks, man.
[22:04.78]Report to the Commodore system for the final phase of your training.
[22:07.79]Good luck.
[22:10.55]Omega low.
[22:11.29]Omega low.
[22:12.57]ERGLIC.
[22:14.41]ERGLIC.
[22:18.33]Yeah, I know.
[22:18.87]I know.
[22:19.81]I know.
[22:21.83]Okay, cool.
[22:22.66]Good link.
[22:24.10]I'm busy.
[22:30.30]Just expecting her head to spin around 360 degrees.
[22:41.91]Uh oh.
[22:43.43]Hard course.
[22:44.21]Holy shit, this is hard.
[23:28.62]I'm so excited.
[23:29.20]Okay, I have to calm down.
[23:33.18]Holy fuck, how... That was insane.
[23:36.70]How did I not get any damage done?
[23:38.90]Am I regenerating health?
[23:40.74]Oh...
[23:57.97]This is what it's like when you're in a dream.
[23:59.49]That's what it looks like when you're flying around in a dream.
[24:08.69]Alright, now where's the lightsaber training?
[24:12.92]Password.
[24:13.56]Leaning.
[24:14.16]Okay, cool.
[24:18.20]So now what?
[24:19.28]Do I get on the ground fighting?
[24:28.72]Okay, static shot, sure.
[24:34.33]That wasn't funny.
[24:38.55]My bitrate is really low right now and I'm like, wait, is there an internet problem?
[24:41.75]It's like, oh, no, no, no, right, right, right.
[24:43.07]There's like fucking a thousand kilobytes of data on the screen right now.
[24:52.34]I'll lower it.
[24:57.22]It's a little up.
[25:03.50]We have them, Lord Vader.
[25:05.00]Within moments, our troops will board their ship.
[25:07.76]We'll then have the stolen plans back in our possession.
[25:10.94]And Princess Leia as well.
[25:13.85]Excellent.
[25:14.25]I shall oversee her interrogation personally.
[25:16.21]Uh-oh.
[25:20.29]Fake actor.
[25:21.07]That sounds like a tractor beam.
[25:25.01]This is a dream.
[25:25.77]I had a Star Wars dream.
[25:27.79]I'm afraid there'll be no escape for the princess this time.
[25:36.34]R2-D2, where are you going?
[25:38.72]I'm just waiting for a guy to turn the corner that's supposed to be your dad, but he doesn't look like your dad at all.
[25:42.60]He has a mustache on.
[25:43.43]Your dad doesn't have a mustache, but it's your dad in your dream.
[25:45.27]It's fucking weird.
[25:46.13]It's restricted.
[25:48.15]Oh, I'm going to regret this.
[25:50.83]Are you sure this thing is safe?
[26:00.72]Okay, Darth Vader is dead.
[26:01.96]In that chair.
[26:02.38]Somebody's holding his mask from behind and doing a voice.
[26:04.62]While he's just sitting in the chair, dead.
[26:30.39]Uh-oh, emergency!
[26:31.15]I took the animator a full three days to do that, by the way.
[26:34.43]Just watch.
[26:35.17]Lift it up, drink it, put it down.
[26:39.55]It's a full day of work.
[26:58.51]I'm ready.
[26:58.99]Let's go.
[26:59.49]Let's go.
[27:01.13]Let's go.
[27:03.77]That's not very enthusiastic.
[27:08.49]We have to take out the command center.
[27:11.65]Watch out.
[27:11.99]There's a tunnel on the line.
[27:13.32]Here we go.
[27:13.82]Wait, wait, wait.
[27:22.56]Don't go there.
[27:23.22]How do I...
[27:32.07]I'll be honest.
[27:34.01]I'm just kind of aiming just straight down and firing.
[27:36.19]Am I helping?
[27:42.46]Kill it!
[27:45.60]Is this shitty Star Fox?
[27:48.34]Um, sorry, Star Fox is shitty Star Wars.
[27:51.74]Can you rephrase that please?
[28:04.74]He cut his mic.
[28:09.90]No, can we just be real?
[28:11.34]Star Fox is Star Wars with animals.
[28:25.34]I love Star Fox.
[28:26.04]It's like one of my favorite games, especially the one for 64.
[28:29.95]Star Fox 64 might be one of the best games ever made.
[28:32.31]In fact, it is.
[28:32.89]Why would I even say it might be?
[28:39.75]I'm actually doing pretty good.
[28:53.79]I can't wait to get... I gotta get to the lightsaber fight with Darth Vader.
[29:01.47]You're one hit away from death.
[29:03.81]Don't distract me like that.
[29:04.67]How many of these fucking things exist?
[29:16.39]Don't hit the wall.
[29:17.37]Don't hit the wall.
[29:23.06]Alright, let's take out the things on top.
[29:31.92]I did my work.
[29:32.78]Can I do the other thing?
[29:33.87]There's nothing left.
[29:40.95]This is fun.
[29:42.15]I'm having a great time.
[29:43.47]I love this.
[29:44.83]I'm so happy right now.
[29:47.12]I feel like my son was just born.
[29:48.88]Is this what it feels like?
[30:03.45]No, I don't want to do another pass.
[30:16.22]Actual Redditor soy boy.
[30:18.08]What?
[30:21.10]Because he's comparing the 3DO playing it for the first time with having a child be born.
[30:28.53]Alright, I'll give you that one.
[30:30.53]You can have that one.
[30:38.21]That's fine.
[30:39.43]We can have it.
[30:41.52]Kind of true, actually.
[30:42.56]Well, whatever.
[30:45.54]I don't have a sun.
[30:46.30]I don't know what it's like.
[30:47.02]I have to imagine it's something like this.
[30:52.17]Okay, please don't die.
[30:57.45]Don't die.
[30:57.97]Just kill the thing.
[31:05.70]Don't crash into the wall.
[31:14.78]How do I have to... Torpedo's armed.
[31:20.60]Shoot it!
[31:21.56]Shoot in there!
[31:22.14]Did I get it?
[31:29.52]Oh, I got it.
[31:32.81]I think children is like playing Donkey Kong.
[31:43.77]The Ron.
[31:50.59]We got more.
[31:51.05]Uh oh.
[31:51.17]I gotta be careful with this controller.
[31:54.25]Is he alright?
[31:55.16]Oh, he's not.
[32:11.70]I feel like this controller feels so delicate that I feel like if I mash buttons and hold it tightly, I'm gonna mess it up.
[32:16.20]You know when you have your friend over that's a big, strong person?
[32:20.28]And you give them the controller and you don't like how hard they're pressing the buttons, but you can't find the strength to say anything about it?
[32:29.35]You can hear the, like... And you're like, ah, fuck.
[32:34.42]Wish I could fucking be like, dude, just don't fucking do that so hard.
[32:37.12]That's my shit.
[32:38.72]Ugh.
[32:56.52]I did it.
[32:56.82]There was a beta.
[33:00.08]What?
[33:29.32]Yes, time to get on the ground.
[33:30.98]How many times have I said yes in the first 30 minutes of this stream?
[33:38.18]Holy shit, I can kill AT-STs in one hit?
[33:48.15]I'm kind of low to the ground, don't you think?
[34:09.68]It's 18.
[34:10.04]Shit.
[34:12.36]Alright, left side.
[34:15.60]Just do a Jerma joke and crash.
[34:17.11]I can't.
[34:20.21]The game is on rails right now.
[34:21.75]I cannot crash.
[34:33.03]You have a shitty blaster?
[34:35.69]I'm killing things in one hit.
[34:37.07]That's not shitty.
[34:37.76]That's really good.
[34:47.21]One more.
[34:48.15]29.
[34:54.11]Where's 30?
[34:57.20]31.
[34:57.36]Oh, 32.
[34:57.74]Who's left?
[34:59.12]Am I single-handedly destroying everything?
[35:00.74]This ain't like Galaga, right?
[35:06.59]I don't have to kill everything.
[35:08.45]Is it?
[35:21.52]40?
[35:22.36]That's not real.
[35:22.98]I got 44.
[35:23.22]Good.
[35:23.48]Wait, did I lose?
[35:25.68]I didn't lose, right?
[35:27.64]No, good, good, good.
[35:28.34]Alright, L-W-Y-L-L.
[35:29.10]Tony Hawk?
[35:29.94]I played Tony Hawk already.
[35:54.52]Oh, it's R2-D2!
[36:10.98]I played Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk Underground, Tony Hawk 1, I did them all.
[36:17.33]Okay, if you think you're going to get anything good from me from Tony Hawk, no.
[36:20.39]You're going to have to teleport back to when I was 16.
[36:31.20]Don't lose, don't lose.
[36:36.55]The new one.
[36:38.35]Wait, what do you mean?
[36:39.49]Didn't they just remaster the first two?
[36:40.85]I don't even know what to drive to get away from this.
[36:51.65]God damn it.
[36:53.17]Okay.
[36:53.97]Alright.
[36:54.21]Alright.
[36:54.47]Alright.
[36:54.75]I'm fine.
[36:55.09]I'm fine.
[36:55.31]I have plenty of life.
[36:57.25]Stay on course, Harris.
[36:58.47]We'll lose them in the asteroid field.
[37:01.88]How old is Jermo?
[37:03.80]28.
[37:06.28]And then in parentheses, plus seven.
[37:14.41]I am dodging.
[37:14.99]What are you talking about?
[37:21.53]I don't... Ugh.
[37:32.39]No, I'm getting hit by the asteroid.
[37:36.61]Calm down, I'm fine.
[37:41.68]Don't hold it.
[37:42.66]Don't death grip this thing.
[37:53.17]Shit, I- Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it!
[38:08.68]Kill that guy, kill him!
[38:11.32]Oh my goddammit.
[38:12.58]Oh fuck, okay.
[38:20.13]Play Doom for the 3DO.
[38:21.51]I got plenty of fucking video games, don't you worry.
[38:29.15]Don't- Just focus on dodging, nothing else.
[38:33.64]The amount of damage that the asteroids do is pales in comparison to what- Down or left?
[38:40.22]Down or left or right?
[38:41.04]Right.
[38:45.59]How am I not dodging that?
[38:46.79]I very much am!
[38:58.02]Down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[38:59.16]Which way?
[38:59.48]Which way?
[38:59.76]Which way?
[39:00.12]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[39:00.94]We're fine.
[39:03.28]I think I... Did I actually get hit by it?
[39:04.60]There's no way.
[39:10.99]God damn it.
[39:12.47]I'm about... Okay, don't get mad at the first game.
[39:15.19]You can't do that.
[39:19.40]They programmed this game on a toaster, okay?
[39:22.64]You can't get mad at this.
[39:33.02]Alright, if I lose another life, I'm just going to chip away at change games.
[39:40.60]It was actually a microwave.
[39:43.13]When I get to zero, I'll do... I just love Star Wars.
[39:46.09]Just hold on.
[39:52.41]How is that not a dodge?
[39:53.67]Run that back and tell me.
[39:55.21]I'm going all the way to the right.
[40:06.71]Fuck.
[40:21.23]What the fuck?!
[40:26.21]How do you dodge in a game that's on rails?
[40:28.82]It's... Alright.
[40:30.74]Alright, I can fucking do that.
[40:37.23]When did looking in another direction dodge your car?
[40:39.76]It's not like somebody's driving straight at me and I go, oh shit!
[40:44.04]And I lean my body to the left and not turn the wheel.
[40:47.88]I'm not going to do anything.
[40:53.32]Oh my fucking god.
[41:01.42]No, no, no, no!
[41:10.09]Dude, what?
[41:12.93]What are you talking about?
[41:14.09]Okay, I was holding the controller all the way to the right.
[41:25.54]And I still got hit by that one.
[41:42.56]Right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[41:44.09]It's right.
[41:44.49]It's right.
[41:44.87]I remember.
[41:45.31]I've memorized the whole damn thing.
[41:46.45]I gotta get the password for this one.
[41:49.37]Fuck you.
[41:50.03]Come on.
[42:00.86]All the way.
[42:01.16]All the way.
[42:01.54]All the way.
[42:01.98]Don't hold down.
[42:02.54]Don't.
[42:02.82]All the way.
[42:03.22]All the way.
[42:03.54]All the way.
[42:03.84]All the way.
[42:04.12]All the way.
[42:04.40]All the way.
[42:04.68]All the way.
[42:08.26]Which one is this one?
[42:08.78]Up?
[42:09.04]I don't know.
[42:09.40]I have no idea.
[42:10.24]Up?
[42:10.84]Left?
[42:11.24]Right?
[42:11.43]I don't know.
[42:15.67]I can't even see them coming at you!
[42:40.66]I don't know, down?
[42:41.92]Down, I think.
[42:46.18]Oh, fuck.
[42:47.13]I'm okay.
[42:55.67]Can this please end so I can get the password, please?
[42:59.68]Don't fucking drive into me, dude.
[43:01.36]What are you doing?
[43:02.12]Give me the password for the next one.
[43:05.03]Give me the password for this one.
[43:05.77]Give me the password.
[43:06.25]Password.
[43:06.43]Give me the password right now.
[43:07.23]Give me the password.

[43:10.15]Give me the password.
[43:12.19]Give me the password.
[43:12.73]Give me the password.
[43:13.24]Give me the password.
[43:13.72]I want to play the lightsaber level.
[43:15.78]That's not cheating.
[43:16.46]I did it.
[43:16.80]He drove into me.
[43:17.64]That guy was an asshole.
[43:20.16]I hear all the passwords.
[43:22.24]Nice.
[43:22.58]Okay, good.
[43:23.18]Perfect.
[43:26.29]Okay, so level one.
[43:27.71]Alright, cool.
[43:31.99]I don't want a high score.
[43:35.10]Next game?
[43:35.66]Hold on.
[43:36.22]I like this one.
[43:40.88]Let's go with... Okay.
[43:46.22]Mazik?
[43:48.28]Mazik.
[43:55.82]No, stop.
[44:00.05]Why?
[44:00.29]Don't give him that.
[44:00.77]He's going to keep playing this.
[44:03.18]I like this one.
[44:05.24]I'm sorry.
[44:05.76]It's been, it's been 30 minutes.
[44:07.14]I'm going, I'm breaking the rule.
[44:09.28]It was, it has to be at least 30 minutes.
[44:12.75]Yeah, but don't worry.
[44:15.83]I haven't, I'm like it.
[44:16.71]Okay.
[44:17.33]Mazic.
[44:17.73]Let's see what it does.
[44:48.05]Just watch the cutscenes.
[44:50.45]Wait.
[44:51.95]Alright, I'll put the next one in.
[44:55.25]It's the wrong password.
[44:57.35]I might come back and play this one, though.
[45:03.88]I actually like this one.
[45:04.80]I think there's more to see.
[45:09.32]Coming up next is Twisted the Game Show.
[45:12.41]Let's see how good that one is.
[45:19.27]You're going to see the colored bars thing.
[45:24.82]Just warning you.
[45:25.32]You're going to see it right now.
[45:31.15]Alright.
[45:31.63]This next one is going to be fun, too.
[45:38.37]Requested the game show.
[45:48.56]All I saw with this one is the box.
[45:51.54]I just turned it on to make sure it worked.
[45:54.44]I think this one's going to be insane.
[45:57.80]Here we go.
[46:16.14]I gotta make sure I keep these in a good spot.
[46:19.62]Yeah, I'm using the RetroTINK 2X Pro.
[46:21.52]Thing's awesome.
[46:26.61]Here we go.
[46:40.48]Is this EA?

[108:37.31]I can't get out of this.
[108:38.89]We're stuck here forever.
[108:53.61]Which car should I do?
[108:54.65]Lumberjack car?
[108:56.37]These all look very sexual to me.
[109:17.17]Like, all these cars.
[109:18.11]It's just like, okay, what's with... Why do they look like this?
[109:20.65]Or maybe just... I bet on them?
[109:22.01]Pick two machines.
[109:23.17]One, click a machine.
[109:24.67]Alright, I'm betting on it.
[109:25.71]Click a machine.
[109:43.19]Okay, and we're going to bet.
[109:44.33]Yeah!
[109:44.45]Okay, bet.
[109:44.67]Stop doing that!
[109:45.19]You're going to hurt us.
[109:45.71]Okay.
[109:45.91]Get a special driving... Okay, now I'm going to bet on the two cavemen.
[109:48.69]And we're betting.
[109:49.93]Okay.
[110:11.57]Alright, so we're betting on either... Here we go.
[110:14.69]This is it.
[110:15.45]Alright, let's go.
[110:18.77]Come on, penis car!
[110:23.00]Wait, they're in first and second.
[110:40.93]Wait, didn't the race already start?
[110:43.30]What race is this?
[110:46.74]We already saw that!
[110:47.66]Oh, in first place?
[110:49.22]Did I miss a queue?
[110:50.60]It's very inefficient, holy shit.
[111:11.44]What?
[111:12.76]What?
[111:13.14]Bullshit.
[111:13.66]I lost.
[111:32.39]This is the worst thing I've ever seen.
[111:34.27]Alright, we're gonna bet.
[111:34.99]Who won?
[111:35.23]Alright, let's bet on... Okay, we're gonna bet on... I don't even know what this is.
[111:37.79]We're gonna bet on Shaggy and Scoop.
[111:39.47]I'm okay with that.
[112:05.97]The next thing we're gonna do is Umbrella Car.
[112:07.99]People paid money for this?
[112:11.51]I did.
[112:11.85]Let's go, go, go, go, go!
[112:13.73]Ooh, ooh, ooh, come on!
[112:32.70]Where's my guy?
[112:33.30]Where's my guy?
[112:34.68]Did I pick Umbrella Car and Dragging Screw?
[112:37.17]Okay, well he killed us.
[112:38.27]Oh my gosh!
[113:10.31]Alright, that's us right there.
[113:11.57]Come on.
[113:12.09]That's us right in the front.
[113:14.71]Are we going to win?
[113:16.17]No, fuck off.
[113:17.09]No.
[113:17.29]What the fuck?
[113:17.93]That's stupid.
[113:18.47]I have to win one of these.
[113:33.62]Can I bet on the mustache guy on Dastardly?
[113:38.42]What about the actual race?
[113:41.62]Can I drive a car?
[113:46.51]I'm gonna go with the other one.
[113:47.45]I'm gonna see if I can drive a car.
[113:52.63]There's two modes.
[113:53.77]There's Racist TV and then there's Trip.
[113:57.13]What the hell is Trip?
[114:03.06]Uh, okay.
[114:07.13]Open the door?
[114:07.65]We're gonna get in the car.
[114:14.51]Stealing the car from the laboratory?
[114:29.53]Is that the wheel?
[114:32.91]Why is this a baby toy?
[114:34.23]Insert disk?
[114:37.56]What?
[114:37.70]What other disk?
[114:38.24]There's no other disk.
[114:39.08]There's no other disk.
[114:40.04]No, there's no other disk in here.
[114:57.43]There's no space for another disk.
[114:59.62]This is the original box.
[115:00.62]Wait a minute, is it behind here?
[115:07.04]No, there ain't no second disk in here.
[115:14.20]What?
[115:14.78]I don't understand.
[115:17.18]I can't do it.
[115:18.76]Is this like paid DLC or something?
[115:22.83]Insert.
[115:23.25]This is bullshit.
[115:24.81]Wait, somebody has it.
[115:25.93]It says, Wacky Races is not, I repeat, not a racing game.
[115:30.37]Shocked, yes, me too.
[115:31.58]Wacky Races is split into two parts.
[115:33.58]One part is betting, the second part is map and object finding.
[115:50.66]You don't have a driver's... Okay, stop talking.
[115:52.22]I'm trying to... Where's the second disk?
[115:55.58]I don't have a... Why is it taking so long to say this?
[115:57.64]Okay.
[115:57.82]I want to do Racist TV.
[115:59.10]I have to win one.
[115:59.55]This is my last try.
[116:00.53]I know exactly who I'm picking, by the way.
[116:22.25]You need to win the gambling to get a card.
[116:27.24]You serious?
[116:43.80]I love this one.
[116:44.92]It's super odd.
[117:06.01]Damn, I'm looking over there and I see a bunch of gems.
[117:10.09]This is going to take a lot longer than I thought it was going to be.
[117:14.14]This is going to be like three months.
[117:15.70]37 more games.
[117:16.34]There's so many over there.
[117:27.90]Okay, let's go.
[117:29.02]I'm betting on... I'm betting on... a guy in a helicopter and a Model T. Let's go.
[117:32.02]And a special driving card.
[117:32.94]Holy shit, you're right.
[117:57.21]Why do they have to do that?
[117:58.67]They actually like seizure warning for real.
[118:00.38]Where's Waluigi?
[118:03.08]This is the universe that Waluigi came from.
[118:05.94]Please, I want the driving part.
[118:22.64]The real strategy here, guys, is to pick the same car every time and do it 100 times.
[118:26.16]It's gonna happen at least once.
[118:27.18]You can't do it hard.
[118:30.10]It'll hurt.
[118:30.56]Was that both of my guys?
[118:31.78]That was the two cars that I picked.
[118:34.99]Get the fuck out of here.
[118:52.78]Oh my god, give me a fucking break.
[118:57.52]Why touch it?
[118:58.92]Why did you touch it?
[118:59.90]Cavemen winning again.
[119:02.08]Shit, the dragon power.
[119:35.23]I don't have to apologize for that.
[119:36.71]Tell him to.
[119:37.41]Am I ever gonna win?
[119:38.89]I don't think I'm ever gonna win.
[119:49.42]Alright, I'm going with... Okay, other plane.
[119:56.86]The plane and then the lumberjack?
[120:03.52]Okay, how about the two planes?
[120:07.50]Both planes.
[120:08.50]Both flying machines.
[120:09.40]The helicopter and the plane.
[120:10.44]Who wins the TV show all the time?
[120:21.10]the data on this?
[120:29.45]Oh, Dick never wins.
[120:30.33]Shortcut.
[120:30.83]Alright.
[120:31.21]He's not gonna get the planes.
[120:32.39]Planes can fly.
[120:32.89]Alright.
[120:46.71]Why would you go in there?
[120:49.11]You can fly.
[120:50.35]You both went in there.
[120:55.17]Still got a guy on the right.
[120:56.31]There he is.
[120:58.19]Oh, shit.
[121:01.33]Bingo.
[121:05.17]I think that's a win.
[121:08.64]Come on.
[121:09.52]Pass him.
[121:10.30]Pass him.
[121:10.78]No!
[121:16.84]Watch it.
[121:19.48]Cut his head off.
[121:20.22]Are you shitting me?
[121:23.06]And fucking Penelope Piston goes in front of us.
[121:26.18]Unbelievable.
[121:27.30]Unbelievable.
[121:33.00]I did so much work there too.
[121:47.84]I have to win.
[121:49.56]It hasn't even been 30 minutes.
[121:50.54]I'm fine.
[121:51.62]Okay, we're going to do the same deal.
[121:52.80]We're going to pick the same two people again.
[121:54.58]Ryobait, thanks for the 10 subs.
[121:56.04]Thank you, Ryobait.
[121:57.68]10 community subs.
[121:58.40]That's a lot of fucking subs.
[121:59.28]That's 10.
[121:59.50]Thank you, seriously.
[122:17.56]Always pick the same two fucking people.
[122:19.62]Why are you watching this?
[122:20.70]I have to win.
[122:25.95]One of these times, it's going to happen.
[122:27.77]I don't care how long this takes.
[122:30.63]Ask them.
[122:34.69]Start flying already.
[122:35.31]He just bombed us.
[122:36.01]Was that all of us?
[122:37.25]Was that all my guys?
[122:38.11]Wait.
[122:38.27]Explain.
[123:10.03]Still get somebody in, right?
[123:12.55]No.
[123:14.53]Skip it.
[123:16.57]Fucking caveman.
[123:17.77]Okay.
[123:28.78]Statistically speaking, we should pick the caveman.
[123:33.88]It's a rerun episode.
[123:36.28]No, but now that you can't pick the caveman because now it's never going to happen again.
[123:40.78]That's how illogical the world is.
[123:42.24]Like, it happened ten times in a row, and then when you pick it, it never happens ever again.
[123:51.91]I'm doing it.
[123:55.09]Caveman and... Caveman and the... And, like, the Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends crew.
[124:01.93]Up here.
[124:07.68]Here we go.
[124:17.30]Come on.
[124:23.55]We have Caveman as a backup.
[124:24.61]We'll wait.
[124:24.99]We'll want the Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends crew to win.
[124:26.83]I see a plane in first place and it's pissing me off already.
[124:38.24]No, alright.
[124:38.86]It's okay.
[124:39.60]It's alright.
[124:40.54]We still have another guy.
[124:41.92]Okay.
[125:05.91]These cars are made out of shit.
[125:07.39]Why does the steering wheel come off so easily?
[125:10.24]Where's the airbag?
[125:11.38]It was that thing.
[125:14.76]Is that the plane?
[125:16.24]No!
[125:27.18]Somebody pass him!
[125:28.00]Somebody pass him!
[125:30.24]What the fuck?
[125:31.89]I hate this.
[125:36.65]I have to win.
[125:37.67]I can't just not win one.
[125:41.01]This game was like 30 bucks.
[125:42.73]I have to win.
[125:44.48]How much was it?
[125:45.14]Actually, never mind.
[125:48.16]It was alright.
[125:48.66]It was 15 bucks.
[125:59.65]And then we're gonna go Penelope Piston.
[126:00.99]Oh.
[126:22.12]Come on.
[126:22.58]How many?
[126:23.84]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, was it 10?
[126:27.31]20% chance to win every single time.
[126:28.35]We've lost every single time, right?
[126:29.77]Or a little bit more.
[126:34.53]Yeah, good.
[126:35.55]Not this time.
[126:51.72]I think we're still good.
[126:53.22]I don't think we're in there.
[126:54.66]Our two characters are not in there.
[126:59.23]You're playing the Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends music!
[127:20.36]That was me!
[127:20.66]That was me!
[127:21.28]That was me!
[127:22.76]That was me!
[127:24.46]What?
[127:28.15]They've won?
[127:28.73]They don't win ever.
[127:29.59]There's never been an episode where they win.
[127:32.07]They've never won in a single fucking episode.
[127:34.03]This is ridiculous.
[127:39.41]No, they don't win.
[127:40.53]They're a plot device to teach you lessons.
[127:48.18]To like brush your teeth and to always like be kind to your neighbor and shit.
[127:52.85]I'm doing it again.
[127:57.91]Alright, we're going with a wild card here, penis car.
[128:12.00]We have not seen a single penis car win.
[128:18.14]We've seen almost every other person win.
[128:19.58]There's been two that haven't.
[128:20.78]We're going to go with the odds of... It's time.
[128:24.97]No.
[128:25.15]This is different.
[128:34.31]This is different.
[128:35.03]Come on, Buzz Lightyear.
[128:46.65]Take your giant dick and go forward!
[128:48.55]That's fine, that's not us.
[128:50.65]That's not us.
[128:51.01]Wait, Penelope Piston passes everybody.
[128:53.43]Wait, where's mine?
[128:54.57]No!
[128:54.75]Pass!
[129:16.29]Don't do it!
[129:19.34]You can't let Penelope- Oh, she hit the brakes!
[129:21.10]You hit the brakes, you fucking idiot!
[129:22.72]This is first place!
[129:23.36]Why'd you just do that?
[129:23.96]You could've won.
[129:24.58]Just step on the gas.
[129:40.79]Penelope Piston is a sure bet.
[129:42.27]I just keep not picking her.
[129:48.66]It's because he's a gentleman.
[129:56.14]Alright, Penelope Piston and... ...Fweedledee and Tweedledum up there have won twice each.
[130:03.62]I think it's time to go with the trend.
[130:06.58]I'm going Caveman.
[130:12.51]Why am I so engrossed in this?
[130:13.95]What came at me?
[130:35.43]means let's go or something right
[130:53.55]Um... I... Excuse me.
[130:54.85]Did you... That doesn't make any... What the fuck just happened?
[130:58.03]Is anybody else on the course?
[130:59.55]Oh, it's a dream.
[131:00.13]Okay.
[131:00.39]Alright.
[131:01.15]We got a guy in second place right here.
[131:25.55]Do it.
[131:26.81]Cross that finish line.
[131:28.78]Do it.
[131:29.16]Why are you hitting the brakes again?
[131:31.34]It's a photo finish.
[131:31.94]Who won?
[131:33.16]That's a photo finish.
[131:34.34]Roll back.
[131:38.32]There it is.
[131:38.70]Get over there!
[131:40.41]No!
[131:40.53]No!
[131:55.16]If only his penis was a little longer.
[131:57.20]It's okay.
[132:01.97]It's perfectly fine just the way it is.
[132:04.19]But if it was a tiny bit longer.
[132:22.80]What's a wild card here?
[132:23.88]Who hasn't won?
[132:24.80]You.
[132:26.24]Pick the tank?
[132:26.82]No, they haven't won.
[132:28.02]Model T has not won.
[132:49.59]This kills people.
[132:54.52]I understand like, oh, put a little bit of oil in the road.
[132:56.76]You're trying to kill all these people.
[133:01.80]Wow.
[133:02.56]Get parried.
[133:10.76]No, Lumberjack doesn't win.
[133:20.88]Somebody actually said it in the chat and I didn't listen.
[133:26.14]Somebody said it and I didn't listen.
[133:28.18]I was gonna do it too.
[133:39.66]Why is that just me?
[133:41.66]That character is just me.
[133:43.70]Did that guy get crushed by a rock?
[133:51.47]It really speaks to me on a spiritual level.
[134:04.13]It's Elmo.
[134:09.53]Elmo and Penelope?
[134:12.93]Pick the lumberjack.
[134:14.03]I got it.
[134:14.56]I got lumberjack and Penelope.
[134:20.36]Let chat vote.
[134:22.29]I would do that.
[134:22.89]The only problem is I don't want to keep it on this screen for too long because it... I just hit cancel.
[134:26.29]Fuck.
[134:27.81]It's... This is incredibly abrasive and horrible.
[134:32.25]Click maps?
[134:33.81]I don't think I'm gonna... Do I have click maps enabled?
[134:35.98]Alright.
[134:37.18]We'll do it from here.
[134:37.88]We'll do it with click maps.
[134:38.72]But fuck that stupid thing.
[134:40.94]Hold on.
[134:44.26]Ah, it's just so awful.
[134:45.30]I don't... I'm gonna hurt somebody.
[134:50.98]Link, please.
[134:51.72]Please notice me.
[134:54.06]Hold on.
[134:57.94]That's pretty good.
[134:58.50]Alright, we got Penelope and we got Lumberjack.
[135:00.23]Wait, this is the dream.
[135:02.17]Who wins the dream one?
[135:03.47]I forget.
[135:21.67]Is it Penelope?
[135:22.91]Did we actually win?
[135:23.91]I think this is a win.
[135:25.49]Penelope wins this one.
[135:26.89]We're good.
[135:27.60]We're good.
[135:28.08]Yup, because we get forward and then he backs off, right?
[135:52.67]Yup, this is it, we win.
[135:54.03]This is it, we win.
[135:57.42]No.
[135:59.08]What the fuck?
[136:01.10]Unbelievable.
[136:09.64]Alright, I'm gonna do- we'll do, uh, click maps.
[136:17.23]But please be aware that this is gonna be flashing horrible images on screen.
[136:21.25]It sucks.
[136:24.10]Alright, where's my extensions?
[136:26.02]I'm gonna keep it on this screen for a second.
[136:27.35]Hold on.
[136:27.63]Uh, did they change the extension page thing?
[136:29.83]Hold on a second.
[136:52.30]I'm going to do this because I really don't want to have anybody puke.
[137:02.60]We're going to temporarily go like this.
[137:03.94]You know who's down here.
[137:06.52]Lower left is Buzz Lightyear.
[137:08.72]Lower right is Lumberjack.
[137:11.23]You know where they are.
[137:15.23]I'm going to turn on the click maps in just a second.
[137:17.29]Let me make sure I can do that.
[137:21.57]I have to win.
[137:22.07]Okay.
[137:24.05]You ready?
[137:29.00]Go ahead and start clicking.
[137:32.86]You know where they are.
[137:39.42]Take a screenshot?
[137:40.60]Oh, yeah.
[137:41.48]Here's the thing.
[137:42.22]I can't take a screenshot.
[137:43.38]This is a console.
[137:46.70]I'd have to take a screenshot of my monitor capturing the game.
[137:49.97]You got one?
[137:53.78]Dude, you guys are fucking on top of this like crazy.
[137:56.08]Holy shit.
[137:56.72]Alright.
[137:56.96]Alright, redo.
[138:09.80]Redo.
[138:10.40]Whoa.
[138:10.56]Alright, redo.
[138:13.51]You ready?
[138:16.95]Hey, thanks.
[138:17.33]Jerma sucks for the five community subs.
[138:18.77]Appreciate it.
[138:22.85]And go.
[138:32.77]Oh, that was kind of laggy.
[138:34.19]Alright, looks like cavemen.
[138:38.09]Cavemen are number one so far.
[138:39.29]Alright, cavemen is first click.
[138:49.00]Wait.
[138:50.60]No, that's exit.
[138:51.38]Alright.
[138:51.90]No, forget that.
[138:53.40]Cavemen first.
[138:59.10]And who's second?
[139:04.98]No, exit.
[139:05.44]We have to win one.
[139:05.98]I can't.
[139:06.22]I'm not leaving until we win one.
[139:14.13]Uh, Penelope Piston?
[139:22.50]Got about 1,200 clicks.
[139:25.86]Alright, Caveman and Penelope.
[139:29.46]I would say those are pretty good choices.
[139:30.54]Those are safe choices.
[139:43.23]Alright, we got Penelope and Caveman.
[139:45.47]This is a better win.
[139:48.05]If you guys win first try, I'm going to be mad.
[139:49.95]I wish Penelope... I'm not going to read that.
[139:52.55]That's fine.
[139:53.21]Alright.
[140:11.75]I hope you're right.
[140:13.01]You picked the two statistically biggest winners of the entire game.
[140:27.60]Oh shit, I missed a raid from RTGameCrowd.
[140:31.04]Why did that not show up?
[140:31.88]That didn't show up over here.
[140:34.16]Wait, wait, did we win?
[140:36.00]Did we win?
[140:42.92]That was an hour ago.
[140:49.71]That was a long time ago.
[140:50.69]Fuck.
[140:52.33]You're still here, everybody.
[140:53.17]Hi.
[140:54.85]Welcome to the stream.
[140:55.53]Why did it not show up?
[140:58.37]They all left Omega Lo.
[141:00.69]That's what happens in a raid.
[141:01.85]You go to the other channel, you spam 10 emotes, and then you leave.
[141:06.66]Oh, you were right.
[141:08.44]You guys were right.
[141:09.80]No, you weren't.
[141:17.25]Second place does not mean you won, unfortunately.
[141:20.65]Try again.
[141:27.29]I can't take this.
[141:28.73]Neither can I. We have to win.
[141:30.43]We have to win one.
[141:32.02]We can't just not win.
[141:45.94]Caveman again, are you sure?
[141:47.20]I don't know if that's a good idea.
[141:48.38]Please next, Jerma.
[141:53.77]Game sucks.
[141:55.41]I actually, I don't agree, actually.
[141:57.19]I kind of like this.
[141:59.17]This is so basic and simple, but I don't know, it's kind of doing it for me.
[142:05.75]Alright, Caveman.
[142:06.41]Who else?
[142:17.80]You can't do caveman twice.
[142:18.88]You can't double down on this bet.
[142:21.48]Okay.
[142:33.47]It looks like it's going to be tank.
[142:40.88]Okay, I'll go tank.
[142:44.74]Good choice.
[142:47.28]The 6th Tank DT is Gouto Kakka and Shinpei.
[142:49.06]They're doing great.
[142:50.40]The winner for today is... Penis Car, you dumbasses.
[142:53.48]I hope that person's not right, because I was going to say Penis Car.
[142:57.96]Let's go.
[142:59.28]Let's start!
[143:06.20]Cavemen and E-Tank.
[143:08.24]Well, I've been waiting for you, Captain.
[143:10.39]It looks like everyone's getting ready for the Chikichibashi Mall.
[143:18.58]If you're the first screened, you lose.
[143:20.30]Oh, no.
[143:20.62]Oh, no.
[143:21.48]Oh, no.
[143:22.56]Wait, come on.
[143:24.02]It's us, right?
[143:24.80]Tank, did we cross first?
[143:47.02]Oh, fuck off.
[143:47.36]Can you even win?
[143:48.00]Put a click, let's see.
[143:59.00]Alright, there's two more.
[144:00.66]One more after this if you don't get it.
[144:16.66]You guys can't click?
[144:18.14]Right now.
[144:19.02]Yeah, you got it.
[144:22.50]Cavemen.
[144:23.18]Wait.
[144:32.87]Okay, I think a tie means it's cavemen and Buzz Lightyear.
[144:35.91]I don't think I even need to do it again.
[144:42.22]No, hold on.
[144:45.66]Alright.
[144:46.98]Buzz Lightyear.
[144:47.62]Pick the second car now, please.
[144:54.66]If you don't win, you have to give 100 subs.
[144:57.90]That's not fair, considering I have no control over any of this.
[145:00.46]Cavemen?
[145:04.93]Cavemen?
[145:14.87]Alright.
[145:16.11]Let's go.
[145:16.57]You have to give 100 subs if you lose.
[145:18.07]No!
[145:18.17]That's- I'm not gonna pay- I'm not gonna put 500 dollars on the line.
[145:20.49]I've lost every single time.
[145:21.19]You want me to put 500 bucks up?
[145:22.19]No!

[146:31.03]No!
[146:32.18]The one time!
[146:33.86]No, it doesn't matter.
[146:34.60]We lose.
[146:35.14]It's Dragon Power again.
[146:36.32]It doesn't matter.
[146:36.86]It's over.

[148:37.24]Caveman it is.
[148:38.48]Good pick.
[148:41.02]Oh, they picked a fucking caveman.
[148:44.72]Imagine not picking Penelope Piston in this kind of situation.
[148:48.26]Oh, you guys are fucked.
[148:53.18]Oh, you guys are fucked.
[149:01.70]And just for transparency's sake...
[149:04.48]I'm going to make sure you watch me pick.
[149:06.12]See, you have cavemen up there.
[149:08.22]Here's Penelope Piston.
[149:10.18]Ooh, you guys are going to lose.
[149:11.55]I can't wait for that ego stream.
[149:12.95]It's going to be awesome.
[149:14.77]This is my pick, Penelope Piston.
[149:18.97]Let's go.
[149:20.05]Good luck. ...
[149:31.51]Come on, Penelope.
[149:32.41]Get up there.
[149:32.93]No sign of the cavemen.
[149:34.07]Oh, where's Penelope?
[149:35.97]Is Penelope still there?
[149:38.21]Where are the fucking cavemen?
[149:40.07]They're not gonna go...
[150:00.34]Penelope!
[150:00.80]Penelope, do it!
[150:01.30]No!
[150:01.52]Come on.
[150:03.42]The cavemen didn't even get any screen time, okay guys?
[150:06.58]You guys were written out of that episode.
[150:31.06]Let's do it again.
[150:32.44]Let's do it one more time.
[150:33.60]Who are you picking?
[150:52.38]Double or nothing?
[150:53.60]Um... Guys, you're starting to get into the point where... You want me to have to... I have to dump a thousand dollars into subs?
[151:03.11]I don't know if I... No, we're not double or nothing.
[151:04.79]This is not double or nothing.
[151:06.77]Neither one of us won.
[151:13.11]Nobody won.
[151:15.43]Caveman.
[151:16.95]Good pick.
[151:18.70]I'm sticking with my guns here and I'm going Penelope again.
[151:22.72]Let's go.
[151:23.06]Rematch.
[151:23.42]Just to make sure you know I'm not a liar.

[151:25.46]No.
[151:25.56]No.
[151:25.70]No.
[151:25.94]No.
[151:26.94]No.
[151:27.00]It's over.
[151:52.48]Yep.
[151:52.70]This is going to be the one.
[151:54.32]Good luck.
[151:54.76]Get those cavemen out.
[151:56.62]First screen means you're out.
[152:18.92]Come on.
[152:19.66]Come on.
[152:19.94]Come on, do the like... And then you hit by a rock.
[152:22.80]Guys.
[152:23.61]Come on.
[152:23.93]Do it.
[152:24.15]Come on.
[152:50.82]Fuck those cavemen.
[152:52.02]Get them out here.
[152:58.83]You guys just got Viagra'd.
[153:08.01]That's a win.
[153:08.75]That's a win.
[153:09.25]I get it.
[153:09.73]I win.
[153:14.89]Stream of my choosing.
[153:17.19]You guys have to boost my ego the whole stream.
[153:19.39]It has to be the only thing you write.
[153:26.77]Yes!
[153:28.89]Yes, I win!
[153:33.05]I had a feeling.
[153:34.21]I had a feeling that it was going to be that.
[153:37.03]I picked Penelope so many times.
[153:38.55]Caveman won too many times.
[153:40.59]Buzz Lightyear didn't win once.
[153:46.21]No, no, no.
[153:47.09]Don't do it right now.
[153:49.15]What is Urban?
[153:54.49]Double or nothing?
[153:55.25]No, I don't know.
[153:56.15]That's a bad idea.
[153:56.83]No, you just have to win and leave.
[153:57.85]You guys are doing the gifted subs.
[153:58.99]Goiki, 20 community subs.
[154:00.34]I, Elliot.
[154:00.72]I, A, Elliot, 10 community subs.
[154:02.06]You guys already, you guys won.
[154:03.54]That's it.
[154:04.00]It's over.
[154:04.66]20 from ZapX.
[154:05.58]You guys win too.
[154:26.31]20 from Zombie Eater.
[154:27.37]Whoa!
[154:28.53]Okay, alright.
[154:29.35]Settle down, settle down.
[154:30.47]That's 100 from Phylactery Lich.
[154:32.99]Alright, settle down.
[154:34.17]Settle down.
[154:37.24]I can't win twice, okay?
[154:41.52]That's 100 community subs from Phylactery Lich.
[154:44.72]5 from Labster.
[154:45.94]5 from Royal Rogue.
[154:50.37]Holy shit.
[154:52.25]You guys are going over what was owed.
[154:56.82]Five more from Klossky.
[154:58.06]20, oh my god.
[155:02.69]Five from Jamie2803.
[155:05.65]Five from Vankia.
[155:09.23]I think they gotta go out, that's it.
[155:10.49]We're going out on top.
[155:11.83]Next game.
[155:13.31]Wait, no!
[155:13.89]I have to do the thing.
[155:19.18]I got a card, right?
[155:25.67]50 community... Oh my god, dude.
[155:27.81]50 community subs from Zap.
[155:32.04]Excellent.
[155:33.80]You guys are going nuts.
[155:36.02]Jesus.
[155:38.24]That's so many.
[155:39.80]That's too many.
[155:43.33]How many subs is this?
[155:44.43]It's like 300.
[155:45.29]I'm talking about double or nothing.
[155:48.47]I guess triple to nothing.
[155:52.37]Sombra, I show my thanks for 5 subs.
[155:54.17]50 from Zap, 100 from Phylactery.
[155:56.79]20.
[155:58.04]20, 20, 20, 20, 20.
[155:58.88]Jesus.
[155:59.34]5 from Doc Sprocket, 5 from Destroy Dude.
[156:10.58]Oh my god.
[156:13.63]Turn off the smart maps?
[156:14.93]Oh shit, you're right.
[156:16.57]Alright, I got one, look!
[156:17.73]Urban.
[156:21.92]Let's go!
[156:22.26]Hell yeah.
[156:27.67]Do you wanna go?
[156:28.43]Yeah!
[156:28.71]Put it in, let's go.
[156:37.94]Destroy, dude, thanks for the five subs.
[156:42.88]Wait, are we- this is a first person mode?
[156:46.98]Special map items.
[156:50.52]Go!
[156:51.30]Yeah, go!
[156:51.74]Fie from Fungalore.
[156:53.20]Fie from Yeet God.
[156:54.30]Fie from Bofair.
[156:55.12]You guys are going absolutely crazy.
[156:57.00]Go!
[157:28.54]So what do you do on this?
[157:30.28]Is this a hidden object game?
[157:35.36]You said eight possible racers, two choices, two out of eight or one fourth chance of winning or 0.25 or 0.75 chance to fail.
[157:54.42]For example, after 15 tries, we can calculate the chance of losing every time by raising it to the N of tries.
[158:01.56]So 0.75, um, up, up arrow, 15 equals 0.14.
[158:03.20]In other words, there is a 98.6% chance of winning at least once after this many tries or Jerma sucks.
[158:10.39]Alright.
[158:10.61]Stop, where are we?
[158:24.29]What is this?
[158:24.91]This is stupid.
[158:28.09]What planet are we on?
[158:28.69]Live, laugh, love Lucifer 5.
[158:29.47]Zurich 5.
[158:29.81]Blue Comet 5.
[158:30.09]Tona Kaiga 5.
[158:30.63]Holy shit, guys.
[158:53.49]Blackout 5.
[158:54.01]Why are you guys giving so many subs right now?
[159:03.85]Labster Fire.
[159:04.75]A gun?
[159:07.93]What was that?
[159:11.41]Welcome to Urban Land.
[159:12.77]Okay.
[159:23.20]Five from Aikido.
[159:27.66]Special.
[159:30.42]AGB clown, 10 community subs.
[159:33.22]This is some- this is like 500 subs.
[159:34.84]This is fucking outrageous.
[159:40.66]What are we supposed to do?
[159:45.64]Isn't that motherfucker on a cereal box?
[159:47.54]What's the cereal that guy owns?
[159:48.70]It's Max?
[159:50.82]Honey- like honeycomb.
[159:51.76]What is it?
[159:52.34]The bear.
[159:59.51]Larify 64 5 subs.
[160:05.19]Poison type 5 subs.
[160:06.61]It's just like 5 subs a second.
[160:11.50]I said this before and I'll say it again.
[160:12.58]This is like you guys are trying to put me in another tax bracket.
[160:18.00]What about Penelope?
[160:26.50]Is it weird that I... We haven't been able to understand a single thing anyone said, but I get it all.
[160:30.55]I get it.
[160:33.23]What are you doing in this car?
[160:34.43]What are you doing?
[160:35.79]This is my guy.
[160:48.57]Alright, we're going to move on to the next game.
[160:59.71]I think we've exacerbated all things.
[161:02.98]What does that say?
[161:07.36]Observatory.
[161:08.88]Top of the city.
[161:09.80]Five descents.
[161:10.90]Good for one person.
[161:11.96]Here's what you have.
[161:17.02]This is the strangest game ever.
[161:22.56]Okay.
[161:23.72]It's an adventure game now?
[161:30.24]Yeah, this is weird.
[161:31.00]I don't have the mind for this right now.
[161:33.12]Alright, we're gonna move on.
[161:35.90]Coming up next is who knows.
[161:36.96]I don't want to flash those color bars in your face.

[161:58.62]What do you think?
[161:59.58]Wanna play Gex?
[162:02.48]Let us pick this too many.

[168:09.82]Sorry about that.
[168:10.32]I couldn't find Gex.
[168:11.28]It was underneath a huge pile of games.
[168:14.98]Here we go.
[168:18.62]Here comes Gex.
[168:21.57]One of the exclusive... A lot of these are exclusive to 3DO.
[168:26.27]Here's some history for you.
[168:30.54]Gex was supposed to be the Crash Bandicoot Mario or Sonic of the Panasonic 3DO.
[168:37.46]And then, unfortunately, a couple of years went by, and it turned out he was selling car insurance to people instead.
[168:42.54]That's what he does now.
[168:44.90]Some lore for you.
[168:59.65]Yeah, yeah, alright, that, sure, that was a dad joke.
[169:02.13]But I'll, I can do some dad jokes sometimes, it's fine.
[169:07.71]Don't tell me I'm not allowed to make a dad joke once a year.
[169:14.92]Crystal Dynamics.
[169:16.16]Gex and the Gex character are gone.
[169:31.03]Crystal Dynamics.
[169:33.75]They still make shit, don't they?
[169:38.17]It all started sooo simply.
[169:41.61]I had just finished my usual morning routine of nude-funkercise, fired up the Barka lounger, grabbed a quick bite to eat, and prepared to watch some serious tubes.
[169:55.12]Little did I know, my snack was sent... by Rez.
[170:01.74]Did it get poisoned?
[170:07.27]You are...
[170:36.49]Okay.
[170:40.05]Yikes.
[170:41.43]You got sucked into the TV.
[170:44.33]Reviews.
[170:46.51]What we got?
[170:54.78]This doesn't belong on the disk.
[170:56.68]It really doesn't.
[170:59.08]You have soiled the timelessness of this game by putting trailers for other games on the main menu.
[171:05.38]You just kind of have.
[171:09.60]By the way, I own this game.
[171:11.56]So, you'll be seeing this soon.
[171:15.44]This is the trailer for like an hour from now.
[171:30.21]Great.
[171:34.50]That's it?
[171:34.80]It's just a trailer for a basketball game.
[171:38.44]That's it.
[171:38.76]There's nothing else there.
[171:42.62]What's the name of that game?
[171:43.40]When does that game come out?
[171:47.73]What's the point of that?
[171:52.07]I have no idea.
[171:52.87]Okay.
[171:54.67]Options.
[171:54.97]It was up this year.
[171:58.76]Damn.
[172:01.35]Sound, voice, on.
[172:02.15]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[172:05.49]Tail whip, jump, run.
[172:06.57]These are the same people that made Marvel's Avengers.
[172:15.15]No, it's not.
[172:15.71]Are you kidding me?
[172:17.52]What?
[172:21.78]Is this?
[172:25.30]They're still dynamics.
[172:28.73]This dynamic's made.
[172:30.81]Marvel's Avengers.
[172:32.65]Holy shit.
[172:34.29]Yeah.
[172:35.19]Same people.
[172:38.86]That's... That's unbelievable.
[172:44.08]Video deck level one?
[172:46.80]Video deck two?
[172:47.72]What the hell is this?
[172:50.35]Video deck... Is this a save file?
[172:55.04]Company got worse.
[172:57.34]Enter a level, stand in front of a working TV and press the A button.
[173:04.25]That's the only working TV is down here.
[173:10.17]It's not the same people.
[173:11.65]It's the same... It's like Mario World.
[173:22.18]Frankie and Haley.
[173:25.43]Okay, let's see.
[173:28.61]Tail whip, jump, run.
[173:32.52]Oh shit, this is actually pretty fun.
[173:34.60]Find level remote controls to turn on new level TVs.
[173:39.70]Can I hit him?
[173:47.82]Oh, it's just shitty Gex.
[173:49.50]What are you talking about?
[173:52.99]Tail whip power balls for one health point or eat them for special powers.
[173:57.69]It's Castlevania.
[174:06.24]This is pretty fun.
[174:10.08]Can I jump and slide or anything?
[174:13.48]You got a springboard tail whip.
[174:16.12]How many of these do you need to collect?
[174:17.10]Is it like coins?
[174:27.77]This game, Gex is so cool.
[174:29.65]This is power-up too.
[174:31.21]Doesn't do shit.
[174:42.50]Bubsy and Gex are dating.
[174:43.64]Gex and Bubsy are boyfriends.
[174:44.86]It's always... I don't know why I'm just... I don't know why I decided to read that one.
[174:53.89]Can I hit this?
[174:55.39]Oh, shit.
[174:55.93]Can I go down and get it?
[174:56.63]Three, two, one.
[174:58.29]It's a bomb.
[175:03.59]You always read that one.
[175:04.55]Yeah, because it's the one thing that's just sticking out every time.
[175:07.00]Guys, I'm surprised you don't like Gex.
[175:18.63]There's one letter removed from Jex.
[175:23.13]Can I crawl?
[175:31.35]Ooh, I did it!
[175:32.93]Level 1-1 completed.
[175:35.93]I'm trying to shoot.
[175:36.53]What does it remind me of?
[175:38.42]What game am I playing right now?
[175:41.20]It's not Gex.
[175:41.80]What is it?
[176:05.21]Donkey Kong Country?
[176:06.03]Yes, there it is.
[176:06.95]Thank you.
[176:10.83]Got the exact same vibe as Donkey Kong Country.
[176:17.27]No, not a clogged toilet.
[176:22.12]How do I get in there?
[176:26.00]Can I get in there?
[176:30.24]Run and slide or something?
[176:38.53]Oh shit!
[176:39.49]Dude, there's verticality in this game?
[176:44.35]Are you kidding me?
[176:48.78]Grab it!
[176:53.34]Why can you not make that jump?
[177:09.45]G4 announcer?
[177:13.07]G4 announcer voice?
[177:15.05]Is it the same person or are you just saying that?
[177:18.51]What does that mean?
[177:29.48]I just skipped the whole level.
[177:33.20]G4 is back, by the way.
[177:36.46]Yeah, I saw it.
[177:43.62]That was easy.
[177:44.12]Got it.
[177:44.56]Come on!
[177:48.14]No!
[177:50.72]Q game.
[177:52.47]What appeal does G4 have in 2020?
[178:08.50]I don't know.
[178:08.96]It's been a very long time.
[178:13.62]5 out of 10.
[178:19.75]Well, here, like, I'll tell you exactly what you mean by that.
[178:23.29]Aren't they doing like a please come host shows on our network thing?
[178:28.49]I saw that, right?
[178:40.83]You do it.
[178:43.49]What would I do?
[178:47.67]Wait, you can grab the edge?
[178:48.79]This is awesome.
[178:58.16]Be a host.
[179:00.30]I'm not a host.
[179:01.22]I can't do host work.
[179:05.46]I'm not well just... Okay, look.
[179:07.70]I'm not good at being me in front of a camera.
[179:09.66]I'm good at being other people in front of a camera.
[179:13.09]I'm very bad at being Jeremy in front of the camera.
[179:16.35]I mean, you give me a fucking ski mask and I'll be a weirdo.
[179:18.78]You know what I mean?
[179:23.22]I'm dead.
[179:27.18]You give me a character that I get to be and I'll do great.
[179:29.84]Was that Kermit the Frog?
[179:30.74]I lost.
[179:38.85]Oh shit, come on, really?
[179:40.57]No checkpoints, nothing.
[179:43.01]I'm gonna speedrun it, come on.
[179:47.21]Get Bugleberry to post.
[179:49.31]No, it's not gonna happen.
[180:01.46]Fuck, I just got hit in the head by the knife.
[180:05.38]Bugleberry on G4.
[180:10.65]Their ratings are going to die.
[180:12.13]I like this feature.
[180:18.08]This is really cool.
[180:23.02]Honest, right?
[180:41.80]Wait, when you get 100 of these, you get an extra life?
[180:44.64]Is that how it works?
[180:47.86]Oh shit, wait.
[180:51.58]There's something up there.
[180:52.76]How do I get that?
[180:54.32]Is there a double jump or anything?
[180:56.06]Oh, you have to actually damage boost up here.
[181:03.15]What does this do?
[181:15.31]It's another life.
[181:17.47]Oh, I just broke another life is what you're saying?
[181:26.83]Hold down while jumping.
[181:27.87]Yeah, I know.
[181:28.35]I know.
[181:30.00]Can I damage boost this?
[181:32.16]Is this the greatest game of all time?
[181:42.16]No.
[181:43.52]Pretty good.
[181:47.22]It's the first time I've ever played it.
[181:55.09]Wacky Racers was better.
[181:58.57]Well, okay.
[181:59.47]Wacky... I can't even say it.
[182:02.28]Wacky Racers was not a better video game, but it was more interesting to me.
[182:10.56]That makes sense, right?
[182:12.24]It's by far not a better game.
[182:17.12]Wacky Racers is not a better game at all than Gex.
[182:24.36]Stand in front of the exit.
[182:25.50]Okay, there it is.
[182:26.36]Alright, let me beat level 2 and 3.
[182:28.22]This is the kind of game that you would just keep your mouth open and just sit on the couch and play it.
[182:38.98]And did he just puke?
[182:40.22]Kill your TV, man.
[182:45.12]trying to make like a Bart Simpson kind of character Bart Simpson and character and what was it for turn the lights in your house off which TV should we turn on the one on the bottom one on the top just the d-pad to choose remote press the a button let's go

[183:21.61]Brave danger.
[183:28.89]Well, that hurt.
[183:33.11]Can't lick people to death.
[183:34.16]This is a rip-off of Super Frog.
[183:42.34]Oh, super rock!
[183:43.54]SNL?
[183:43.66]Yeah, it's Bart Simpson.
[183:46.86]I just killed a guy.
[183:49.36]That guy's huge.
[183:49.94]Who was that?
[183:50.26]What was that?
[183:50.70]I want that.
[183:51.13]I can't get it.
[184:12.60]I'm gonna come out of that casket.
[184:14.96]Wait.
[184:15.58]Does it work like Link?
[184:22.68]It does.
[184:26.68]Is this supposed to be power-ups?
[184:32.20]Well.
[184:34.22]I got the flower.
[184:35.14]That's good.
[184:39.22]Why do I get attacked by Duke Nukem?
[184:43.09]No, that's the Slaughterhouse guy.
[184:45.96]Splatterhouse.
[184:47.12]Not Slaughterhouse.
[184:47.98]Splatterhouse.
[184:49.75]Did they make that game too?
[184:50.65]Is that a reference?
[185:09.67]This references is all Gex is.
[185:11.49]Is it TV shows?
[185:13.38]Monami made this.
[185:24.46]Crystal Dynamics did.
[185:27.18]Oh my goodness.
[185:30.99]I get it?
[185:33.27]I did.
[185:33.53]I got it.
[185:34.87]Sick.
[185:37.95]Don't fall down.
[185:38.65]If I fall down, I'm dead.
[185:41.64]That was pretty sick.
[185:49.36]Alright, what's this thing doing?
[185:50.82]Gas register?
[185:51.82]Photo?
[185:54.46]Wait, does it save pictures of you?
[185:57.95]Give me that picture.
[185:59.81]It's a checkpoint.
[186:09.97]Oh, okay.
[186:15.62]That's cute.
[186:16.55]That's a cute way to do that.
[186:18.67]Got money?
[186:24.55]This looks like a shield, right?
[186:27.57]I'm lagging the game.
[186:28.17]Are there bosses in Gex?
[186:50.62]Yes, there are.
[186:51.22]I think I'm still confused.
[186:59.89]Is the health up at the top right?
[187:07.11]There are 100 bosses in Gex.
[187:08.79]Nice.
[187:12.27]Very good.
[187:15.56]Very good job.
[187:17.66]That's a good job.
[187:22.53]The platform looks pretty fun.
[187:23.43]The platform!
[187:24.03]I always tell when someone's lying when they do that.
[187:33.28]It is though.
[187:35.50]Oh shit.
[187:35.88]Did you miss the remote?
[187:41.30]I did?
[187:41.58]Oh fuck, I missed the remote?
[187:42.90]Was I supposed to... Alright, let me get the remote.
[187:47.85]Where was it?
[187:48.37]What did I miss?
[187:53.38]I'm fucking so mad, but I can't show it to you.
[187:55.85]I can't show it to you.
[187:56.47]I'm so upset.
[188:02.13]I have to be very, very careful.
[188:03.35]I don't want to be screaming.
[188:06.63]It was right there, too.
[188:07.39]It's alright.
[188:07.85]The checkpoint's right here.
[188:10.59]Right here.
[188:10.85]100 bosses.
[188:15.06]Okay.
[188:21.54]I can't even think about it.
[188:28.54]He's naked again.
[188:29.44]Yeah, go ahead, spread it!
[188:31.66]Spread it everywhere!
[188:34.50]I want you to show my grandkids that.
[188:37.32]Alright, where's this remote?
[188:57.67]This guy's perverted.
[188:58.69]No, I'm just saying.
[188:59.65]I don't... It doesn't... I don't care.
[189:02.45]It doesn't bother me.
[189:04.39]It's bothering him.
[189:05.09]No, it's not.
[189:05.55]That's what you would say if it was bothering you.
[189:08.40]No, I wouldn't.
[189:08.80]I would say don't do that.
[189:18.32]Show migraine.
[189:19.02]What?
[189:19.36]Okay.
[189:20.34]There's nothing wrong with that photo.
[189:24.14]Guys, replace the background with me sitting at the beach.
[189:26.58]Or with a pool behind me.
[189:28.30]What's so wrong with that?
[189:32.90]Where's the remote?
[189:36.29]Where is it?
[189:40.73]Oh, I thought this was the top of this thing.
[189:42.17]Did I destroy it or did I get it?
[189:44.27]Where'd it go?
[189:44.63]Did I get it?
[190:03.81]I got it, right?
[190:04.39]Nah, I got it, I got it.
[190:16.68]This place is weirder than 4th of July at Rick James Place.
[190:23.82]It is Bubsy.
[190:25.46]It's Bubsy.
[190:26.32]They saw Bubsy and they were like, wow, that game sucks absolute asshole.
[190:30.21]We can make a Bubsy character that does the same thing that Bubsy does, but not have the game make you want to throw up and punch yourself in the face a hundred times.
[190:35.69]I commend them for it.
[190:53.03]He thinks he's funny, LOL.
[191:00.48]Whatever.
[191:00.84]Find a videotape and your game will be saved when you beat the level.
[191:04.02]He thinks he's funny.
[191:05.60]That's so funny.
[191:08.72]Stop saying that.
[191:11.74]You're freaking me out.
[191:34.33]Climb it?
[191:42.20]Immediately lost it.
[191:43.12]That always sucks in Mario.
[191:46.36]The worst sound to hear in Mario is... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[191:51.45]Fuck.
[192:23.48]Oh nice, the interlaced TV.
[192:26.12]I love this power-up.
[192:34.64]Did he say, I don't eat anything but this?
[192:39.74]That was sad.
[192:40.54]He said that in a crying voice.
[192:42.00]Are we supposed to be laughing at that?
[192:47.66]Oh shit, what have I done?
[192:49.35]Checkpoint right there.
[192:51.53]It's an old Windows cursor.
[192:52.85]It really is.
[193:10.42]Stomp.
[193:11.30]This console sucks.
[193:12.40]No, it does not.
[193:13.10]Are you kidding me?
[193:15.61]What did you just do?
[193:17.55]What did you just say?
[193:20.27]There's no way that I can't believe what you said.
[193:21.95]No way.
[193:23.87]This console's sick.
[193:29.72]What are you talking about?
[193:30.76]This console doesn't suck.
[193:31.40]What do you want about it?
[193:34.08]Who sent you?
[193:36.00]It's a spy.
[193:38.86]Is that a camera?
[193:39.68]How do I get that?
[194:03.60]the video fucking sucks it no it does not how dare you say something like that can you imagine unironically text text text text text text you know what I mean
[194:39.21]It still hit me.
[194:41.55]Upvote.
[194:46.93]Don't fall in that water!
[194:48.23]Alright, I'm gonna give this another 10 minutes.
[195:07.29]I like it, but.
[195:09.30]I like it, but.
[195:10.66]You know?
[195:12.18]It's one of those scenarios.
[195:12.94]I like it, but.
[195:15.58]You know what I mean?
[195:25.12]Speedrun on this game.
[195:26.72]Anybody got that info?
[195:36.91]40 minutes?
[195:37.19]I'm going to say 30 minutes.
[195:43.35]It's only so fast you can go through these levels.
[195:46.48]I want that full health.
[195:59.50]Careful, I don't want to mash on the controller.
[196:01.48]This thing's expensive.
[196:08.73]30 minute nap.
[196:13.76]Music's not good.
[196:15.47]Eh.
[196:17.47]Eh.
[196:18.13]Eh, music could be better.
[196:31.96]Did the 3DO cost like $800?
[196:33.02]I mean at launch?
[196:34.04]I have no idea.
[196:34.90]It was pretty expensive.
[196:36.52]Now, $799.
[196:36.78]Holy shit, that's insane.
[196:37.96]It was $699.
[196:59.32]What was their intention with this video?
[197:05.20]They wanted a big home entertainment system, but... Eventually, didn't they want to have fully interactive movies on here and shit?
[197:17.28]It was a goal with this video that they never achieved.
[197:19.14]What was it?
[197:20.38]Oh, shit.
[197:20.64]It's bonus time!
[197:29.71]Use the skulls to kill... Come on.
[197:43.04]Fuck.
[197:51.08]It's 10, right?
[198:01.99]And I'm off.
[198:10.39]I got a remote.
[198:13.87]Holy shit, I got a remote.
[198:19.13]Alright, let's end this level so I can get a win.
[198:27.41]Let me get out of here.
[198:32.91]Oh, get out of here.
[198:43.42]What?
[198:44.16]Okay, that was weird.
[198:45.38]Don't fall in.
[198:51.50]Dangerous.
[198:52.46]Very, very dangerous.
[198:56.00]It's pretty good cat puke noises, I would say.
[199:18.39]Right?
[199:18.67]No, what is this?
[199:31.46]Tape?
[199:35.40]Ha, that is wild.
[199:38.64]That's my favorite one.
[199:39.58]Oh, that's wild.
[199:40.77]That's wild stuff.
[199:42.05]That's Johnny Carson.
[199:42.97]That was my boys.
[199:44.11]Nice touch.
[199:46.55]I don't have a remote?
[199:53.37]What?
[199:54.39]I didn't get a remote.
[199:55.23]I thought I got one from the bonus round.
[200:00.12]We told you.
[200:00.72]Yeah, but I thought I... No, I don't have to do this.
[200:06.04]Oh, come on.
[200:06.78]No.
[200:11.41]I'm going to go very fast if I can get it.
[200:17.82]I don't care about any power-ups.
[200:18.80]Go.
[200:20.06]No, no, no, no, no.
[200:20.62]Not next.
[200:20.98]Not next.
[200:21.30]Not yet.
[200:21.61]Not yet.
[200:21.85]Wait, wait, wait.
[200:22.15]This is the flagship game of the entire console.
[200:24.05]Just let me get to the first boss.
[200:26.29]We'll just watch.
[200:26.77]Is he on PS1?
[200:29.25]Oh, fuck that.
[200:29.91]No, was he?
[200:32.97]What are you talking about?
[200:46.91]Is this on PS1?
[200:50.77]Wait, this is... This is not the flagship 3DO game.
[200:53.09]I thought this was an exclusive 3DO game.
[200:55.19]Is this on PlayStation?
[200:58.01]It even runs better on the PS1.
[201:04.73]Oh, I... Exclusive 3DO game.
[201:15.28]What are you talking about?
[201:22.57]Look, I'm already back to where I was.
[201:33.54]Army men was the flagship.
[201:36.40]What?
[201:38.10]Don't fall anywhere.
[201:48.76]Alright, that's not bad speed.
[201:49.86]I don't want anyone to tell me that wasn't pretty good speed, but get back here immediately and get the remote.
[201:53.75]I gotta get to the- let me get to the first block.
[201:56.59]Alright, where is the remote?
[202:21.15]Need for Speed 3DO is awesome.
[202:22.60]I have that.
[202:23.06]It's over there.
[202:27.64]Only five minutes remain.
[202:28.62]Alright, where is this?
[202:34.56]I'm gonna play that.
[202:42.81]I'm gonna!
[202:45.85]I walked by it.
[202:56.64]Where?
[202:59.48]Oh, shit.
[203:00.47]Okay, I got it, I got it.
[203:01.25]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[203:13.37]That was Gex.
[203:13.75]It's pretty good.
[203:15.23]It's fun.
[203:16.01]It's just, I'm getting out of here.
[203:20.49]I thought I could have momentum and jump, but you can't have momentum and jump.
[203:22.98]Did I get the fucking remote?
[203:24.88]Finish it.
[203:25.58]I can't.
[203:26.10]I don't want to.
[203:27.18]Alright, I will.
[203:27.60]Fuck, I don't want to finish it.
[203:28.79]I will.
[203:31.11]I'll do it.
[203:31.67]Alright, I'll finish it.
[203:32.37]I'll finish it.
[203:32.77]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[203:49.24]God damn it.
[203:50.16]I'm putting something else in.
[203:54.84]It's a fun game.
[203:55.80]It's great.
[203:56.68]But it's a platformer.
[203:57.50]And, like, whatever.
[204:00.13]Gex is awesome.
[204:00.87]It's a flagship game for this video.
[204:03.21]Go get it one day.
[204:07.93]It's good.
[204:08.39]I like it.
[204:09.09]I like it.
[204:09.45]But 30 minutes is up.
[204:10.81]Next.
[204:18.01]Wacky Racers was more fun.
[204:19.89]It wasn't.
[204:20.42]Alright, you guys have a choice.
[204:29.38]I need ones in the chat for original John Madden football.
[204:34.46]Or two in the chat for Need for Speed.
[204:48.46]Need for Speed.
[204:50.32]It's two.
[204:53.74]Oh, I've got to save this one for last.
[205:01.87]This is going to be so fun.
[205:07.25]After this, it's streamer's choice next, and it's going to be fucking awesome.
[205:13.56]Here comes the original Need for Speed.
[205:18.68]x is cool this is 3do classic console x enter the gecko was released in 1998 on the Game Boy Color
[205:49.56]Yeah, if you want to play the fucking fake version.
[206:00.83]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[206:01.89]That's okay, guys.
[206:03.29]In 40 years, my Gex copy will be worth like five grand.
[206:08.01]That's alright.
[206:17.53]Now it won't?
[206:18.01]We'll see.
[206:22.75]I feel like I'm either gonna love this game or I'm going to hate it.
[206:24.85]I think I'm gonna love it or hate it.
[206:43.04]Okay, I gotta tell you, a MIDI track does not work on this footage.
[206:56.31]Doesn't sound very badass.
[207:02.81]Is this real footage, though?
[207:04.63]I'm confused.
[207:05.35]It's a real footage game?
[207:07.39]You actually drive a car?
[207:13.86]It is real footage.
[207:14.72]Oh, yes.
[207:26.10]Road and Track presents The Need for Speed.
[207:39.27]Well, this is it.
[207:40.59]What every red-blooded, land-loving, land-speed record wannabe ever wanted.
[207:43.85]A free ticket in the rocket of your dreams.
[207:47.28]Again, camera pointing down at Guy looking up.
[207:52.22]Fasten your seatbelts.
[208:07.47]EA Canada.

[208:18.07]How do I play?
[208:20.20]Start?
[208:25.34]I pressed start.
[208:26.16]I'm just waiting.
[208:30.00]Oh, look at how cool this guy is.
[208:31.42]Alright, what do I do?
[208:34.98]What do these mean?
[208:37.07]This is a scrapbook.
[208:39.23]I don't know what to do with this.
[208:40.23]Okay, I'm going to click on him.
[208:49.06]What does that mean?
[209:00.19]Is that a race?
[209:01.23]Is that a fight?
[209:02.57]Is that like a test I'm taking?
[209:03.99]Is that, what is that?
[209:05.19]What is that?
[209:05.75]What's he referring to?
[209:07.82]Did I just order something from a diner?
[209:10.92]I don't know what that was.
[209:22.54]I'm going to click the road.
[209:24.75]City.
[209:26.35]11.8 miles.
[209:27.27]From the tranquility of suburbia to the pandemonium of the urban jungle.
[209:32.01]This route opens up with gentle freeway and winds its way into the bowels of the city's underground.
[209:37.26]He said bowels.
[209:37.92]Snaking everywhere.
[209:40.76]Concrete barriers, long winding tunnels.
[209:43.14]It's all here for you.
[209:44.46]But watch out for traffic.
[209:45.70]It comes up real quick when you're at speeds these cars want to travel.
[209:49.37]187 miles why would you ever drive that fast on like a regular street let's go it's like my car alright Lamborghini diablo vt next all-wheel drive helps with the bt's 492 brake horsepower
[210:14.61]I don't care about any of this.
[210:15.95]I don't care about any of these things.
[210:17.57]I don't care about the coordinates.
[210:19.71]I don't give a shit about how fast you go.
[210:21.37]I don't need the things spread.
[210:22.57]$252,000?
[210:22.59]Alright, whatever.
[210:23.47]I don't need to see your math problems.
[210:25.41]I get it, it's fast.
[210:26.63]You just could look me in the eye and go, car goes very fast.
[210:47.37]Fucking dangerous.
[210:48.30]That person's in trouble.
[210:51.38]When is hydroplaning cool?
[211:15.53]0 to 60.
[211:16.41]Yeah, I love the 0 to 60 shit.
[211:18.28]Who cares?
[211:23.56]0 to 60 in 10 seconds.
[211:26.86]Oh, were you in a school zone?
[211:28.78]You're under arrest.
[211:32.00]When does 0 to 60 mean anything?
[211:33.59]No, I don't want to watch the video again.
[211:34.75]Get me out of here.
[211:43.88]When you are racing.
[211:45.26]Where are you racing this?
[211:48.50]You're commuting to work with this thing?
[211:50.16]Good thing this thing goes zero to 60.
[211:53.26]So I can be at the red light and step on the gas.
[211:56.36]And then get a $300 speeding ticket.
[211:59.48]Yeah!
[212:11.09]That's pretty biased.
[212:13.34]Guys, people used to drive by my house at like 80 miles per hour.
[212:15.92]Yeah, I'm a little biased.
[212:17.30]How do I get away from this video?
[212:19.04]Get me out of here.
[212:26.50]Wait, what is this?
[212:28.78]These are other cars?
[212:32.14]Okay, I pressed B. Does B leave?
[212:44.70]This motherfucker's driving on the wrong side of the road.
[212:46.86]He's gonna hurt somebody.
[212:47.84]He was swerving into the other lane.
[212:51.28]I'm gonna play the game.
[213:07.50]How do I play the game?
[213:10.58]Is it not a game?
[213:14.04]Okay, how do I go back?
[213:17.88]Select?
[213:20.84]Okay, we're good.
[213:21.33]Okay, this has a wheel on it.
[213:24.05]I'm assuming that means drive the car.
[213:27.49]Skill level.
[213:28.81]Sure.
[213:30.17]Audio.
[213:30.55]This is the options menu.
[213:31.69]Okay, this is the options menu.
[213:57.66]Do I get to pick my car?
[214:02.70]Wait.
[214:04.07]How do you drive?
[214:04.53]Do we get a 3-2-1?
[214:09.35]Where's the 3-2-1 go?
[214:30.08]He has the parking brake on.
[214:34.02]How do you turn the parking brake off?
[214:37.38]I'm in neutral?
[214:41.70]Oh, there we go.
[214:42.21]Got it.
[214:42.39]Nope.
[214:44.67]That's reverse.
[214:55.47]More than you bargained for?
[214:57.45]Too real for you?
[215:00.04]Why are we in the woods?
[215:06.30]Did we just murder somebody together?
[215:07.84]Did we just bury a body?
[215:10.26]I don't understand.
[215:10.92]I'm not going to put my name in.
[215:16.22]Real height.
[215:19.06]I'm like one foot tall.
[215:21.54]Why am I that tall?
[215:28.59]There's no context to any of this.
[215:36.00]Am I lying on the ground in agony?
[215:38.06]Okay, so let's get it into forward.
[215:44.28]Do you have the manual?
[215:45.28]I don't think it matters.
[215:46.58]Okay, here we go.
[215:51.88]Is it in drive?
[215:52.42]Put it into fucking drive!
[215:58.21]I don't know how- I gotta put the- where's the manual?
[216:05.39]First gear.
[216:05.77]Alright.
[216:11.52]Second gear, let's go.
[216:17.37]Third gear.
[216:21.83]Fourth gear.
[216:27.72]Fifth gear.
[216:38.69]Are these people not part of the race?
[216:53.08]Wait, is it auto-shifting?
[217:00.70]There he is.
[217:01.08]There's that motherfucker right there in that red car.
[217:08.30]You think he's gonna get away?
[217:10.18]Nope.
[217:13.00]What's going on?
[217:13.46]Did I just get the police on me?
[217:23.48]Why is he still such a little blob?
[217:25.10]Alright, here we go.
[217:25.82]I'm going like, how fast am I going?
[217:26.95]I'm going like 500 miles per hour!
[217:35.31]Come on.
[217:39.13]Hurry up.
[217:41.79]Judging from the dashboard, this is like my grandfather's car.
[217:47.49]What are we even driving?
[217:50.69]Don't shift so soon.
[217:51.48]It's on auto.
[217:52.08]I'm not doing that.
[217:56.72]Shit, I gotta ride in the breakdown lane.
[218:05.74]Am I going 160 miles per hour?
[218:08.78]This car doesn't go faster than 170 miles per hour.
[218:10.26]Wait, does it have to pass him?
[218:20.22]I passed him.
[218:22.02]Holy shit!
[218:30.14]How do you win the race?
[218:39.33]He didn't say there was a beginning, a middle, or an end.
[218:41.10]He just made fun of me and looked down at me three times.
[218:43.28]How do I win this?
[218:49.06]He's long gone.
[218:49.90]I blew by him a long time ago.
[219:01.31]Where's the end?
[219:04.82]Where's the end of this level?
[219:14.33]There is no end.
[219:15.37]How?
[219:15.73]Yes, there is.
[219:16.23]There has to be.
[219:22.70]You think that guy just gave up and was like, alright, well, whatever.
[219:25.10]I'm done.
[219:25.88]He beat me.
[219:28.58]Why am I still going?
[219:29.46]I win.
[219:33.62]No, that was... I did it.
[219:38.71]I beat him.
[219:42.86]167 miles per hour top speed.
[219:44.78]What?
[219:45.18]Waxed his ass?
[220:06.51]He was in the lead for like 15 straight minutes.
[220:08.36]Are you sure he didn't win?
[220:09.24]Replay.
[220:12.01]Highlight reel.
[220:13.57]Let's take a look at the highlight reel.
[220:36.31]It's just real time.
[220:42.75]This is not even a free... Okay, it's... We can skip that part.
[220:50.50]We're going to just do that part.
[220:56.56]Okay, just get out.
[221:09.32]Somebody said the audio is too early?
[221:10.78]What do you mean?
[221:12.70]Like the in-game audio is too early?
[221:22.81]One guy?
[221:23.25]Okay.
[221:26.37]I'm doing it again.
[221:26.83]I'm racing the same guy.
[221:35.85]Why am I doing the same thing?
[221:37.67]It said continue.
[221:46.17]It's a different track.
[222:01.26]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[222:19.78]You've waited for me?
[222:29.76]Wax his ass.
[222:30.46]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[222:31.82]Change the camera.
[222:35.67]Now it just looks like an ugly video game.
[222:53.50]I don't... This ticking sound.
[222:55.06]I don't get it.
[222:56.84]If you go all the way up, the police show up?
[223:01.00]They didn't do anything last time.
[223:13.65]Okay, I just hit the cop.
[223:16.61]That's a cop car.
[223:17.44]I just hit him.
[223:36.64]Wow, you suck.
[223:43.05]Pull over, should I?
[223:57.58]Where is he?
[224:04.29]Speeding.
[224:14.30]That guy looks dumbfounded.
[224:21.78]Here's the goal.
[224:22.30]Can I catch up after getting a speeding ticket?
[224:28.23]Can I crash into him?
[224:30.31]I almost killed that guy.
[224:37.61]Wait, the car's in neutral right now.
[224:50.39]Another, am I gonna get two speeding tickets?
[224:52.65]Alright, come on officer.
[224:59.91]I'm right here.
[225:10.04]Three cars?
[225:18.43]So I got out of one, somebody pulled up another one, and I'm still about to pass this guy.
[225:35.24]Oh shit, it's gonna be a photo finish.
[225:37.94]Holy shit, your horn is the biggest wuss horn I've ever heard in my life.
[225:45.17]That's not intimidating at all, dude.
[225:48.00]That does not say fuck you.
[226:03.41]Oh shit, a cop's gonna get me!
[226:06.65]The game just didn't let me crash into him.
[226:10.59]Okay, I'll pull over.
[226:16.70]What about him?
[226:17.18]Look at how fast he's going.
[226:18.68]Yeah, pull that guy over.
[226:19.82]Am I pulling him over?
[226:21.24]I can't drive.
[226:21.92]I'm holding down the button.
[226:23.02]What's going on?
[226:45.37]Well, I do believe I got me my first UFO capture.
[226:49.61]You better start turning green real fast, Gizmo, or the National Enquirer ain't gonna buy my story.
[226:55.86]What?
[227:07.18]I got two cars left.
[227:12.10]Assume the position, fast boy.
[227:14.52]Now you're in the fast lane to the county jail.
[227:16.52]Why did you walk up to the car with a shotgun?
[227:32.02]Let's go.
[227:37.59]okay you want to talk about like 2020 video cuts you put handcuffs on me which takes about one second they were probably probably 12 cuts in that three seconds to put on a pair of fucking handcuffs how many times I have to beat this guy before we can is over
[228:11.39]You didn't win.
[228:11.99]Alright, I'm gonna win.
[228:13.54]I like the fuck this guy.
[228:16.38]I need first person driving, it helps.
[228:17.58]I'm gonna win.
[228:21.10]I wanna see what happens if I beat him.
[228:23.32]In a different car.
[228:25.24]I like this one.
[228:28.25]Change the track, don't I have to beat him?
[228:35.83]This is gonna be the fastest you've ever seen somebody do this course.
[229:02.81]Stop pretending.
[229:04.97]There's no such thing as pretending while you're going 160 miles per hour.
[229:10.05]There's no nuance at 160.
[229:11.45]You don't pretend to go 160.
[229:21.63]The purple link.
[229:29.28]I cannot do that right now.
[229:34.14]The old strategy was just blow by the cup.
[229:36.99]I'm going too fast.
[229:37.79]They're not going to catch up to me.
[229:41.15]I'm gone.
[229:53.35]Why doesn't he spin up?
[230:00.73]Where's his total cascading over on the side?
[230:09.06]It's a 5 out of 10 link.
[230:10.20]Don't even bother.
[230:10.76]Alright, I got one guy said not to do it.
[230:26.58]Alright, no more messing around.
[230:27.72]I really don't want to have to do this again.
[230:29.98]I need to beat him three times.
[230:30.94]I seriously don't even understand how that happened.
[230:50.19]God damn it.
[230:50.91]Come on, man.
[230:53.23]He's going to be right here.
[231:00.21]It's okay.
[231:00.75]Forget about the cop.
[231:01.29]I'm going to blow right by him again.
[231:02.67]Alright, we're in the clear.
[231:15.75]Here he is.
[231:18.07]Just absolutely gun it by him.
[231:22.25]We're out of the breakdown lane.
[231:23.79]That's the best strategy so far.
[231:24.91]Get this thing up to 160.
[231:35.07]Go.
[231:36.55]Easy.
[231:38.75]Easy, easy.
[231:39.37]I'm coming up quick.
[231:49.38]See you later.
[231:49.76]Alright.
[231:50.12]Good.
[231:50.72]Good, good, good, good, good.
[231:51.70]On to the next chapter.
[232:11.11]I passed him on the inside.
[232:12.61]You know it.
[232:12.93]I looked at chat.
[232:19.92]I looked at chat.
[232:23.58]We're good.
[232:23.84]Alright.
[232:24.32]Let's beat him again.
[232:31.73]Alright.
[232:32.13]Look, it's a 5 out of 10 is average.
[232:34.05]Let's take a look.
[232:39.54]You got the nerve to push the envelope, man.
[232:41.78]Got some skill.
[232:42.70]That's what it takes.
[232:43.36]Why am I hanging out with this guy in the woods every time?
[232:58.46]Okay.
[232:58.84]I mean, that is a... What do you want me to do?
[233:25.59]Next game, I gotta beat this guy three times before we change.
[233:27.53]Why is he always so much faster than me off the gun?
[233:43.02]Is that just the type of car that he has?
[233:44.44]I'm so bad at driving.
[233:49.15]I need to be driving in first person.
[233:50.13]I can't drive like this.
[233:50.91]I need the wheel to guide me.
[233:53.01]You guys want to stay on the driving theme?
[234:00.01]Should I put in road rash?
[234:03.54]Or you want something completely different?
[234:06.90]Fuck.
[234:19.91]Didn't John Madden?
[234:20.99]No, I think we're going to hold on to John Madden for a little while.
[234:22.88]Yeah, there is no music.
[234:32.07]That's weird.
[234:34.81]Where's the music?
[234:47.74]Get out of the fucking way.
[234:49.04]You idiot.
[234:50.34]Move.
[234:51.54]Turn the radio on.
[234:53.06]I don't have a radio.
[235:08.49]Go by the cop.
[235:17.76]No!
[235:20.76]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[235:30.29]Quick, quick, quick, quick!
[235:31.11]Go, go, go!
[235:34.31]He's right behind it, go!
[235:44.28]This guy's going 120?
[235:48.71]How are you keeping up with me, dude?
[235:51.13]It's going 120 miles per hour right now.
[236:06.20]Where is this cop?
[236:10.36]What?
[236:16.85]Why did I read chat?
[236:17.72]I gotta stop looking at chat.
[236:18.58]Don't look at chat ever again.
[236:20.22]Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me.
[236:21.60]Don't look at chat again.
[236:27.10]Red guy coming up.
[236:28.06]On this side!
[236:28.46]I got him.
[236:31.92]I Mario carted him.
[236:36.61]No!
[236:36.97]No!
[236:37.25]Don't let him go in front of me!
[236:40.17]No, he's past me!
[236:40.91]I'm gonna get in trouble!
[236:49.86]Oh, it's okay.
[236:52.10]It's a speeding ticket.
[237:02.10]Here's your Reddit gold, sir.
[237:19.13]I'm going to crash again if I'm not careful.
[237:20.97]I don't want to lose this.
[237:25.10]So if the cop passes you, that's how you get in trouble.
[237:31.52]No more fucking around.
[237:40.89]Oh, pass him right here on the inside.
[237:44.25]And go.
[237:44.55]Alright.
[237:45.51]Easy.
[237:47.03]Go over the checkpoint.
[237:49.25]Right at the fucking very end, nice.
[238:02.04]Very close, very close.
[238:03.12]You pulled it off.
[238:04.10]Next thing you know, you're gonna be getting a sponsorship.
[238:05.88]A race with the big boys.
[238:10.04]I hate this guy.
[238:15.20]Oh, here we go.
[238:15.72]We got a new cutscene.
[238:23.19]First.
[238:28.78]Speed.
[238:30.50]Champion.
[238:37.57]You need to drop the exposure on your webcam and put up the lighting in your room.
[238:42.75]That's why it looks like that guy.
[239:07.79]Okay, so do I just race him?
[239:09.25]Now what?
[239:16.59]Oh, shit.
[239:16.95]Okay.
[239:18.35]Is that the whole game?
[239:19.07]I just beat the game.
[239:33.70]Link, link, link.
[239:34.48]Alright, I'm clicking it.
[239:35.32]I got it.
[239:37.97]That's not even the right one.
[239:39.23]That's a cop handing you something through the window, not the right one.
[239:46.00]Is this the right one?
[239:48.64]If this is the right one, then this is not worth it.
[239:59.44]I don't think this is not worth it.
[240:07.80]Also wrong.
[240:09.76]Okay, give me the right one then.
[240:27.14]Alright, whatever.
[240:40.08]City.
[240:41.44]Alpine.
[240:42.40]Coastal.
[240:42.82]Alright, we're going coastal.
[240:46.87]Definitely going coastal.
[240:51.79]This is the last race I'm going to do, and then I'm just going to turn it off.
[241:06.11]And then we're putting in... I think we're gonna change the theme up a little bit here.
[241:13.16]Yeah, it's time for a theme change.
[241:14.38]Can I pick a different car?
[241:31.12]What happens if I kill him?
[241:45.71]What a race Alright, I'm done.
[242:00.90]This was fun.
[242:02.22]I'm done moving on what we got next oh
[242:15.47]I mean, this was not fun.
[242:16.57]Yes, it was.
[242:25.30]Madden?
[242:26.58]Alright, I'm gonna put in Madden.
[242:27.76]I'm putting it in.
[242:28.28]We're gonna get it over with.
[242:31.10]I'll give you a choice.
[242:52.27]Okay.
[242:55.89]Your choices are John Madden, the original video game.
[243:02.91]Or.
[243:10.61]Going to sports direction here.
[243:11.77]You can either do John Madden or Wicked 18, which is a golf game.
[243:21.26]One for John Madden, two for Wicked Golf.
[243:32.80]Hmm.
[243:39.68]Shit, this is tough.
[243:43.23]Neither one of them.
[243:44.67]Uh...
[243:50.31]Do an actual poll.
[243:51.55]Alright, we'll do an actual poll.
[243:52.99]Because this is very difficult for me.
[243:54.25]Let's do a straw poll.
[243:59.60]John Madden or Wicked Golf?
[244:14.51]By the way, I want to make sure that I got to get this has got to be very clear.
[244:17.79]Just because it's called Wicked Golf does not mean it's interesting.
[244:22.19]It's golf.
[244:23.41]So could be pretty pog.
[244:25.83]I don't know.
[244:26.23]We'll see.
[244:31.17]John Madden, though, it's original FMV John Madden.
[244:41.55]There's at least probably five to ten minutes of John Madden talking into the camera.
[244:55.79]Okay.
[244:55.93]Alright, thanks.
[245:00.59]It's going to be Wicked Golf.
[245:05.51]Let's go to BRB for a second.
[245:09.18]Don't blow your eyes out.
[245:14.92]Third option?
[245:16.06]There is none.
[245:23.12]There's so many games back there.
[245:24.54]We gotta... Look.
[245:27.12]We have to get through the Wicked 18s of the world before we get to the Jurassic Park Interactive.
[245:37.55]That's gonna be... Holy shit.
[245:56.51]No, we don't.
[245:58.61]Uh, yeah, we do.
[246:00.31]I bought 40 of these.
[246:03.65]I didn't buy, like, the 10 good ones.
[246:05.05]I bought all 40.
[246:05.79]T&E Soft.
[246:19.04]Why'd you do that?
[246:19.78]Because in 20 years it's gonna be worth five grand.
[246:24.32]Wait, is this the thing that the arcades and the ball and you spin the ball as hard as you can?
[246:27.73]Is it golf?
[246:43.47]Where's the green?
[246:46.24]Oh, okay.
[246:48.16]Why are we playing golf in Egypt?
[246:50.44]This does not look like a golf course.
[247:02.95]It's because it's Wicked Golf.
[247:11.77]Oh, sorry.
[247:12.25]Wicked 18.
[247:13.17]Same damn thing.
[247:13.81]Who cares?
[247:20.40]All hole number one, par five.
[247:22.72]Champion tees, 540 yards.
[247:24.07]Members tees, 520 yards.
[247:30.08]The starting hole of Devil's Course is a par 5 that requires considerable skill.
[247:35.92]Water flanks both sides and rocks float perilously above the fairway.
[247:40.88]A good drive on a normal course may only find the rocks here.
[247:44.88]Fortunately, the approach is pretty easy after running this gauntlet, so a birdie is usual for this hole.
[247:52.44]Okay, use the driver every time.
[247:53.85]I got it.
[248:03.13]The American Ninja Warrior intro.
[248:09.17]Okay, member data.
[248:10.35]I mean, we're just gonna... What the hell?
[248:13.65]Game.
[248:13.95]Devil's Open.
[248:14.81]Player 1.
[248:15.23]I thought it said alien.
[248:16.81]Okay, sure.
[248:27.06]You weren't good at driving last game.
[248:28.24]What makes you think you'd be good at golf?
[248:30.40]I'm gonna get a hole-in-one.
[248:31.18]On the first hit.
[248:34.38]First par 2 or par 3 that's available, I'm gonna get a hold of mine.
[248:43.69]Uh... This is just cardboard cutouts.
[248:50.05]Those are not real people.
[248:51.43]Alright, first day.
[248:55.37]Player 1 versus Alan.
[248:56.59]Okay.
[248:59.71]Start.
[249:03.79]Is this 17 holes here?
[249:07.33]Hole number one.
[249:14.21]How do you play?
[249:14.95]Tim Allen?
[249:26.51]Is there a fucking volcano on the right?
[249:32.10]Key up.
[249:33.14]Oh, okay.
[249:39.79]What is he saying?
[249:40.31]Put direction.
[249:43.21]Okay, direction.
[249:44.81]Where is the hole?
[249:49.58]Free wood.
[249:50.96]One wood.
[249:51.40]Alright, I want the one wood.
[249:53.16]I'm just gonna hurt as hard as I can.
[249:57.28]Give me the one wood!
[249:59.84]Okay, are you sure about that?
[250:00.75]Yeah, I'm sure.
[250:05.83]Stance.
[250:11.17]Just slice the fucking ball.
[250:18.43]Oh shit.
[250:27.94]Oh no.
[250:28.64]That's just every single person at the driving range.
[250:36.86]You ever go hit golf balls at the driving range?
[250:38.08]There's always somebody that just fucking skims it every single time.
[250:44.86]Alright, let me try this again.
[250:45.68]Give me the one wood.
[250:53.23]No, I want the one wood.
[250:57.65]I'm going full power.
[251:00.44]I'm happy Gilmore-ing this shit.
[251:02.18]Over the mountain.
[251:02.72]Did I get it?
[251:25.56]Embarrassing golfer I've ever seen.
[251:27.14]The music is so... Okay, let's try it again.
[251:37.63]This guy's just shit-faced.
[251:41.59]Well, player one really probably shouldn't have come to the course after four Red Bull and Vodkas.
[251:50.93]He's one of the top seeds.
[251:51.89]It's unfortunate to see him like this.
[251:57.11]I sent it to a crowd of people.
[252:04.66]Holy shit, that bounce.
[252:06.98]Are you kidding me?
[252:07.82]It was some pinball level shit right there.
[252:16.41]Alright, what do we think?
[252:17.09]Right through the middle?
[252:17.61]Alright, I'm going to go right through the middle.
[252:29.24]What do you want me to do?
[252:29.78]Two wood?
[252:31.14]Get into the volcano.
[252:32.14]No, I'm going right through the middle.
[252:44.13]Bingo.
[252:53.89]How many strokes is this?
[252:54.87]Don't you just pick it up after seven?
[253:02.89]acid okay what point is the caddy just go you know what I'm gonna take over here dude fuck so like every single golf game ever you do the power and then you press a again when it gets into the little middle thing right
[253:34.23]That's what I'm doing.
[253:36.57]Watch.
[253:37.15]Ready?
[253:38.33]I'm not doing it on purpose.
[253:39.47]Watch.
[253:41.85]Okay, here we go.
[253:42.33]Ready?
[253:43.62]That bottom part is where I want to hit it.
[253:45.30]Here we go.
[253:46.40]Power.
[253:48.66]A. Hold it.
[253:57.09]Hold A. Hold A and let go of A.
[254:07.42]Can I try holding it?
[254:11.01]And then let go of it.
[254:12.25]I'll try.
[254:12.57]I am holding it.
[254:13.75]This guy sucks.
[254:19.67]Are we good?
[254:31.38]Are we live?
[254:37.55]Yeah, my internet didn't turn off.
[254:39.91]My internet was fine.
[254:44.01]That wasn't on my end.
[254:45.36]My internet was perfectly fine.
[254:47.98]That's weird.
[254:50.48]Did the Twitch servers get nuked or something?
[254:52.34]That was weird.
[254:56.55]Alright, we're back.
[254:57.41]I haven't even moved.
[255:07.97]Alright, let's go.
[255:08.39]Twitch has been doing that lately?
[255:12.05]Oh, oh, oh well.
[255:13.93]Sorry, both.
[255:15.21]Ugh, whatever.
[255:16.51]270 yards, let's go.
[255:17.61]Alright, let's go.
[255:19.79]Yeah, that wasn't, that was not on my end.
[255:23.17]Oh, fucking Twitch servers.
[255:24.21]What the fuck?
[255:30.75]I fucking, I'm gonna miss.
[255:32.99]That was such a bad miss.
[255:34.42]That was a practice one.
[255:43.33]So do I have to do it before?
[255:44.91]I'm trying to do it while it lands in the thing in the middle.
[255:50.95]Here we go.
[255:51.31]Ready?
[255:52.89]Up.
[255:54.63]Up.
[255:55.25]Right?
[255:55.59]I'm pressing A. I can't.
[255:58.35]I don't get it.
[255:58.87]Am I doing it too early?
[256:12.54]Are you pressing A on the orange part?
[256:13.96]I'm trying to.
[256:14.54]Alright, I get it.
[256:25.49]I get it.
[256:29.58]I understand what's going on.
[256:30.46]I'm going way too far up.
[256:34.90]Cut the viewer count in half.
[256:36.44]Well, whatever.
[256:37.04]It's all good.
[256:49.52]Alright, dude.
[256:50.36]Give me a fucking break.
[256:52.42]Really?
[256:54.48]Really?
[257:00.59]You're just gonna bounce that shit off the rock?
[257:02.55]Fine.
[257:04.77]My turn.
[257:05.07]What do you think?
[257:09.87]It's far enough away?
[257:44.97]Hey, thanks for the placement.
[257:50.69]Alright, can I hit it with a driver?
[257:53.61]I'm gonna go really small.
[257:54.93]Fuck the putter.
[257:55.51]I don't use putters.
[257:56.44]Only driver.
[257:57.38]Only one would.
[258:05.46]Oh, shit.
[258:22.96]Hit the crowd.
[258:23.42]There's no crowd to hit.
[258:24.58]Those are paper cutouts.
[258:25.60]There we go.
[258:32.24]On the green.
[258:32.64]Is that my +2 meter?
[258:41.59]Alright, it's a little bit slightly elevated.
[258:52.78]Can't even change clubs.
[258:59.31]Get in there.
[258:59.75]Okay, it's nine feet.
[259:09.98]Straight in.
[259:15.46]Alright, what's that?
[259:17.16]Our player one, plus twelve.
[259:20.01]What did he get?
[259:25.95]This is for birdie.
[259:31.64]You suck.
[259:32.78]Wait, he got it.
[259:33.74]Damn it.
[259:42.58]I was going to say that would have been way worse than me.
[259:44.38]Hole number two coming up.
[259:58.54]Am I even on the board?
[259:59.44]Alright, now I get how the game works.
[260:07.77]Alright, we're going... Yep.
[260:10.05]We're going 300 yards straight ahead.
[260:27.88]How much THC?
[260:29.09]Zero.
[260:29.33]Alright, we gotta try to get it right on the mountain.
[260:43.09]Good Wii Sports music.
[260:43.97]Where's that going?
[260:48.42]Hmm, it's alright.
[260:59.04]I mean, for an amateur, that's fine.
[261:05.23]I'm going right for the top of the mountain.
[261:09.75]318 yards to the pin.
[261:10.25]Come on.
[261:21.26]Son of a bitch.
[261:25.64]I flew too close to the sun.
[261:32.83]It's alright.
[261:33.13]I'm going to make it up right now.
[261:37.47]Pay attention to chat.
[261:38.83]What?
[261:47.61]Perfect.
[261:57.43]How do you what?
[261:58.93]Why do I have the same caddy?
[262:00.83]Wait, how am I supposed to do this?
[262:04.43]Is this possible?
[262:05.09]There's a gigantic rock in the way.
[262:10.09]Am I going to ping pong this?
[262:11.07]125 yards.
[262:14.00]Alright, we're going to go with 140.
[262:23.83]Get it up the ramp.
[262:35.94]Holy shit, it worked.
[262:43.26]No it didn't.
[262:53.51]What?
[262:55.29]How?
[262:58.66]How did you do that?
[263:02.72]I can't hit mine over that.
[263:09.84]Give him the pigeon wedge.
[263:21.71]Perfect.
[263:22.93]Over it!
[263:26.77]I'm not far behind him.
[263:35.68]35 yards to the hole.
[263:37.57]Pitching wedge again.
[263:38.19]Alright, I'm going to take a little bit off the top.
[263:41.65]Halfway.
[263:56.66]Shit.
[264:00.14]You're not going to get it.
[264:17.95]Gotta get over this mountain.
[264:19.19]Is this gonna be too hard?
[264:26.26]It's way too hard.
[264:32.02]What?
[264:34.50]No, it wasn't.
[264:35.52]That shadow is really deceiving.
[264:38.18]Where'd it go?
[264:45.70]Where did it go?
[264:46.22]It went across the other side.
[264:55.69]Alright, fuck it.
[264:56.39]Whatever.
[264:56.85]Give it to me.
[265:16.14]I did skim it up the mountain, that's good.
[265:29.60]Get on the green!
[265:32.70]We're on the green, good.
[265:38.56]No we're not.
[265:39.04]Do I just keep bouncing it back and forth?
[266:01.80]Give me a break.
[266:02.70]Alright, can I just take two strokes and put the ball wherever I want?
[266:11.34]It's not possible.
[266:12.01]This is not going to do anything.
[266:21.25]Did I do it?
[266:44.14]Let's be fair, though.
[266:45.20]If you saw this on TV for golf, you now watch golf.
[266:49.14]When no fucking way you would before that.
[266:53.42]I made it up to the second cliff.
[266:57.95]Alright, we're on second cliff.
[267:16.21]What the?
[267:16.47]Did I make it?
[267:17.01]I made it!
[267:17.21]I made it!
[267:17.43]I made it!
[267:17.67]I made it!

[267:18.33]I made it!
[267:18.77]I made it!
[267:19.49]I made it!
[267:25.08]What should I use? Pitching wedge? No, no no no. Just put this shit. Just hit it really hard.
[268:02.06]Too hard.
[268:02.62]Yeah, that was a little too hard.
[268:14.41]Oh my god, dude.
[268:20.55]I'm just gonna try to putt up this.
[268:24.11]I'm gonna putt up this thing.
[268:25.27]I'm gonna hit it up the mountain.
[268:34.49]It's gonna slide up.
[268:37.48]See?
[268:38.10]That's all it took.
[268:40.14]That's all it took.
[268:41.70]I had to put it up the goddamn mountain.
[268:59.43]Yes.
[269:00.51]Fuck.
[269:01.04]Okay, I'm fine.
[269:04.97]Is this for par?
[269:15.34]What am I at?

[270:53.49]Fuck you.
[270:54.07]Okay, like, security, remove this guy.
[271:11.38]Get security and just put him in handcuffs and get him out of here.
[271:20.12]How light does it have to be?
[271:21.40]Holy shit, I almost got it.
[271:31.61]Yeah, finally, finally.
[271:33.01]Jesus Christ, we've been sitting here for so long, dude.
[271:35.40]Hurry up.
[271:38.12]And I turn around.
[271:38.68]I'm like, thank you.
[271:39.74]Thank you.
[271:40.38]I do like a bunch of bows.
[271:41.52]I tip my hat.
[271:49.78]Okay, I'm good.
[271:51.42]Plus 19.
[271:53.74]Freddy Dread, holy shit, you just gave 50 community subs, my god.
[272:06.99]Hole number three.
[272:08.18]Par four.
[272:09.10]Champion teased.
[272:11.12]Holy shit.
[272:12.26]That's a ton of subs.
[272:13.10]Thank you, Freddy.
[272:14.68]Freddy Dredd, ladies and gentlemen.
[272:17.06]We also had 50 bucks from Zombie Eater and 50 bucks from Sir Canine.
[272:20.64]Back to back.
[272:21.30]Which is an insane amount of money.
[272:26.81]Zombie Eater says, I've been a big fan of yours.
[272:30.37]You always succumb to clicking links in chat, though.
[272:33.34]I'm offering you a simple challenge.
[272:35.54]I don't think you can go through an entire week of streaming without clicking a single link from chat.
[272:41.31]Address this challenge in reply if interested.
[272:44.19]Or ignore this.
[272:46.79]No, it's impossible.
[272:51.74]That's a physical impossibility.
[272:52.84]No way.
[272:58.00]And then SirCanine says, Jerma, this is the 27th time I've reached out about my dork cube.
[273:02.42]My friends are considering leaving because I lost my mind waiting for it.
[273:04.74]Please reach out to me.
[273:06.42]My friends keep telling me it's a scam.
[273:08.60]Yeah, it's a scam.
[273:10.30]You got scammed.
[273:11.22]Sorry, dude.
[273:16.15]Let me beat this guy once.
[273:17.17]I'm gonna try, actually, pretty hard.
[273:18.35]I'm in front of him, even if I'm in the trees.
[273:29.45]God damn it.
[273:29.91]Alright, I gotta get in front of him.
[273:34.32]You hit it, now haul it out.
[273:35.74]Alright, come on.
[273:42.70]Wind's coming in two miles per hour.
[273:43.92]Pitch and wedge this shit.
[273:46.10]72 yards.
[273:46.48]Let's go.
[273:50.67]This is snow level music.
[273:52.05]Holy shit, that's so accurate.
[273:54.57]That's unbelievable.
[273:55.61]You're right.
[273:55.95]I want to go all the way.
[274:05.13]Further than him.
[274:07.59]Shit.
[274:10.31]35 yards away.
[274:10.75]Third stroke?
[274:18.47]Let me get a par, please.
[274:29.00]Eat shit.
[274:29.56]I'm right there.
[274:30.82]I'm right there.
[274:32.72]I'm gonna fuck this guy up right now.
[274:36.63]Sweet approach.
[274:38.47]He talks?
[274:49.40]Ain't got nothing.
[274:50.20]Dickhead, get out of the way.
[274:50.96]Get out of the way.
[274:52.64]I'm gonna beat him.
[274:53.62]This is it.
[274:54.02]I gotta be very careful.
[274:54.82]Alright, this is slightly elevated.
[275:01.16]I gotta bump this to the right a little bit.
[275:04.50]No.
[275:05.74]Yeah.
[275:07.87]Pump it to the right a little.
[275:09.47]Like right there.
[275:10.01]Is it straight?
[275:13.87]Should I?
[275:17.15]Straight?
[275:19.08]How much power though?
[275:19.82]Alright, I'm going to say quarter powder.
[275:21.98]A quarter pounder.
[275:27.34]Oh no.
[275:36.01]Is it
[275:39.60]I was right.
[275:40.02]Yeah, I was right.
[275:40.72]Should have listened to my gut.
[275:42.52]It's okay.
[275:49.45]Stroke four, stroke five.
[275:50.47]God damn it.
[276:19.29]Alright, this thing's coming up.
[276:20.97]I'm about doing 18 holes.
[276:28.10]If I don't get a hole... Okay, if I get a hole in one right now... Here's the opportunity.
[276:33.04]This is only 160 yards.
[276:33.98]I'm going to get a hole in one right here.
[276:48.28]It is very possible, yeah?
[276:56.74]Par three.
[276:57.26]I can do this.
[276:57.76]Let me at least get par.
[276:58.48]What's he got?
[277:02.42]Just a bowling alley.
[277:06.01]Not even close, dude.
[277:07.35]You're fucked.
[277:13.13]160 yards.
[277:16.51]Full power with a six iron.
[277:21.72]We're gonna go four iron.
[277:24.60]That's a win.
[277:42.68]Hole in one.
[277:46.71]Get in there.
[277:50.83]Why is everybody naked?
[277:52.67]Why is everybody dressed like they're at the beach?
[277:54.03]This is a golf tournament.
[278:05.63]I can get it right here.
[278:06.47]11 mile per hour wind right there.
[278:12.94]What's it look like?
[278:13.62]Come on, I can get it.
[278:16.08]Give me the putter.
[278:18.92]Let's go.
[278:25.07]Why is there a sand trap on the green?
[278:26.79]That's a great question, yeah.
[278:28.57]I have no idea.
[278:37.99]Oh!
[278:38.15]Oh!
[278:44.80]It's procedurally generated?
[278:46.04]That would be funny.
[278:50.16]Oh, fuck off.
[278:51.84]Sure, okay.
[278:53.54]Get out of here, buddy.
[279:01.59]This is for par.
[279:02.35]I have to hit this.
[279:03.89]And then the disk can come out of the tray.
[279:06.39]And I can go piss.
[279:09.91]This is straight on.
[279:11.95]Straight on.
[279:12.71]Not too hard.
[279:13.31]Not too soft.
[279:14.05]Just... I don't know.
[279:16.61]Like this.
[279:18.05]Like that.
[279:18.33]Par.
[279:21.37]I win.
[279:30.40]Nice par.
[279:43.22]Thanks.
[279:43.62]Alright, I'm going to pick a mystery one next.
[279:50.24]I'll be right back.
[279:53.56]And replace the negative water.
[283:37.19]Okay.

[284:21.42]With a Z. Here we go.
[284:41.18]Is it a fighting game?
[284:42.08]It kind of looks like one.
[284:49.45]I think I bought this from my friend once.
[284:53.35]Oh, did you?
[285:00.55]And a Sonic software, yeah.
[285:01.88]So they had something to do with it.
[285:03.94]Whatever it was.
[285:13.86]You make your own balls?
[285:17.26]Or is it pre-rendered balls?
[285:22.26]Welcome to my world.
[285:23.04]Let's see who's got balls.

[287:17.52]This is... What am I doing?
[287:22.93]I just kicked his ass.

[287:27.73]Does he come back to life?

[290:10.58]I don't know if I'd go that far.
[290:14.46]It's slightly humorous.
[290:16.12]It's kind of humorous.
[290:18.30]Is there a final boss?
[290:27.06]I wonder what the Shang Tsung of the Balls universe is.

[297:16.46]Just get away from me.
[297:20.32]I'm having an aneurysm watching this.
[297:30.15]Are my feet on my hands?
[297:47.63]Well, that's been balls.
[297:49.92]That's balls the director's cut.
[297:51.82]I hope you liked it.
[297:52.94]Okay, Chuck E. Cheese just came to the chat and said, Hey, Jerma, just figured I'd throw a message in here to mess up your chat for the rest of the day.
[298:11.73]Omega LOL.
[298:13.93]Why is Chuck E. Cheese such a fucking troll?
[298:25.10]What?
[298:27.38]He's still here?
[298:28.06]He's been here.
[298:29.06]He's been hanging out.
[298:32.04]Don't say swear.
[298:32.94]Hey, Chuck E. Cheese is like 60.
[298:38.82]Chuck E. Cheese can come in here and I can swear at him.
[298:41.40]Well, no.
[298:41.92]Let me rephrase that.
[298:43.23]We can swear.
[298:45.83]He's like 50.
[298:46.23]Alright, that was balls.
[298:49.41]That was pretty fun.
[298:51.50]Alright, coming up next is going to be probably the final one of the day.
[298:56.44]And I will be back here tomorrow with even more.
[299:05.82]End of the stream voice incoming after the next one.
[299:11.16]Make it a decent one, huh?
[299:11.90]Alright, do we end it with John Madden football?
[299:17.12]Or do we end it with another Japanese one that we can't understand?
[299:20.28]Or Road Rash, that's right.
[299:29.70]end it with madden alright I'm gonna end it with madden so then we don't have to start with madden tomorrow right that makes sense plus another reason why I want to give this a link kind of a break um it feels very it's very hot I don't think they ever expected people to sit here for five hours straight to play this game on this console
[299:56.94]It's pretty warm and it's very hot.
[300:04.83]We shall see.
[300:05.69]Here comes Madden.
[300:10.32]Tomorrow I'm also going to give more details on FTK.
[300:12.22]So those of you that are interested in that, there's going to be a lot of details tomorrow.
[300:17.76]Because that is happening this weekend on Sunday.
[300:19.48]Alright, let's get Madden in here.
[300:30.12]30 in this picture 25 years old in this picture this is broken alright original John madden football
[301:01.64]This is the Madden where he makes a horrifying demon noise.
[301:13.93]I don't think that's in any of them.
[301:26.86]I'm excited for this one.
[301:30.40]radio experience from Electronic Arts exclusive hey folks it's me John man and today we're gonna wait do you actually not play football do you just watch games I'm having a realization maybe I do not even play football
[302:02.80]No?
[302:03.04]That'd be really weird.
[302:16.69]John Madden has never played football.
[302:19.57]Yes, he did.
[302:20.09]Hi, everyone.
[302:22.89]Welcome to John Madden football.
[302:24.69]You look so young.
[302:25.93]That's it?
[302:33.19]all the FMV we get?
[302:34.39]Is it Trump?
[302:37.04]It's not Trump.
[302:37.86]Alright, well I have to be the patron.
[302:52.81]Oh, the New England versus, I don't know, Green Bay.
[302:57.79]Regular season.
[302:59.69]One player home.
[303:01.67]Yeah, yeah.
[303:02.57]The Jets, yeah.
[303:03.55]Fuck the Jets.
[303:04.11]Let's go.
[303:05.09]Patriots.
[303:09.27]Well, the game's finally here.
[303:10.91]The teams are taking the field, and they're about ready to kick it off.
[303:17.78]Okay.
[303:20.23]Why is he yelling that like he's in the bathroom yelling out to you?
[303:25.08]Like put the groceries away or something.
[303:27.00]That was weird.
[303:27.72]Okay.
[303:27.86]-2.
[303:28.16]Try harder.
[303:28.60]Time that guy up for an hour.
[303:48.61]New York Jets.
[303:50.89]Call heads or tails.
[303:59.24]Why do they need an FMV for that?
[304:02.42]We won.
[304:06.62]We are going to receive the ball.
[304:10.54]New York Jets.
[304:12.34]Which goal will you defend?
[304:15.92]This team picks the home goal.
[304:17.28]Okay, let's go.
[304:20.69]Okay, here's the opening kickoff.
[304:22.43]Everyone should be ready.
[304:23.59]Here's the opening kickoff.
[304:24.99]Everybody should.
[304:25.65]I can't see it.
[304:26.43]It's Trump.
[304:26.89]I can't even unsee it.
[304:28.60]You've ruined everything.
[304:29.38]You've ruined John Madden for me.
[304:33.34]Why did you do that to me?
[304:54.65]Five-yard gain.
[304:55.69]Alright.
[305:01.49]We're going to go Hail Mary Pass.
[305:03.17]Can I get John Madden's advice like you could do in the other games?
[305:08.57]We're going to go big.
[305:10.22]Shotgun.
[305:12.88]Quick slant.
[305:20.20]I don't even know how to play.
[305:21.90]Audible.
[305:22.24]No, I want to...
[305:28.73]Who has it?
[305:29.21]I don't know what happened.
[305:33.83]I was trying to throw the ball.
[305:42.83]What are you doing?
[305:43.35]I don't know how to play.
[305:45.79]Pats suck, huh?
[305:46.88]No, they don't.
[305:48.40]Alright.
[305:49.02]How do you pass?
[305:51.78]Throw it up fine.
[306:02.70]I'm trying to pass the ball.
[306:26.54]See that?
[306:27.06]You keep your head up and drive right through the man.
[306:31.61]I think it's C. You snap with C and then you pass with C. Okay, here we go.
[306:45.15]How did you not catch that one?
[306:49.63]Why did he not catch it?
[306:52.17]Why did you do that?
[306:52.85]Just catch it.
[306:53.94]You were right there.
[306:59.37]Oh, damn.
[306:59.89]We're all the way back here.
[307:01.67]Attack.
[307:06.17]Center.
[307:08.39]This game's really old.
[307:09.23]Is it illegal to be offside?
[307:10.25]We'll find out.
[307:17.19]Yeah, it is.
[307:18.22]They can't go any further, so who cares?
[307:27.00]I'm going right for the quarterback.
[307:27.88]Right down the middle.
[307:30.91]The guy kicks me in the face.
[307:32.05]Come on, Brady.
[307:48.16]I'm not even trying to block the field goal.
[307:49.80]That guy was flossing?
[308:02.92]Let's go for some run plays.
[308:04.56]Where's John Madden?
[308:08.10]Did an intro and an outro and that's it.
[308:10.02]And he got paid like $6 million for this.
[308:19.90]Alright, let's try.
[308:24.67]I'm going to try to get a touchdown right here.
[308:25.85]Let's do a good drive.
[308:33.97]Normal.
[308:35.36]I'm going to do a near.
[308:37.56]Let's just do right here.
[308:38.96]HB toss.
[308:40.36]Hold that right side.
[308:41.12]Check that ball.
[308:43.34]Deflated ball.
[308:45.55]Very, very, very funny.
[308:47.61]Nice block.
[308:51.05]I can't believe you blocked.
[308:52.41]You knocked that guy in the ground and he got up and got me.
[309:00.38]Here's the thing you guys don't understand.
[309:01.60]Like, you could say deflated ball.
[309:03.16]I don't care.
[309:03.76]I'm not on the Patriots.
[309:08.32]I don't... Wait.
[309:09.00]What did you just say about the Patriots?
[309:11.53]I'm on that fucking team.
[309:13.57]I've run that team.
[309:14.35]Why don't you say that about my team?
[309:16.61]I'm on it.
[309:19.91]I don't know.
[309:20.91]I don't have any connection to the Patriots.
[309:27.18]It's cool.
[309:27.92]They have New England in front of it.
[309:33.60]Alright, catch it!
[309:44.46]That was such a perfect pass too.
[309:48.24]Try this again.
[309:51.67]Is there a catch button?
[309:52.47]I think it's A. Ref, get the hell out of the way!
[310:03.13]Tackle the ref.
[310:13.84]I'm not sure you can do that.
[310:21.46]Touchdown!
[310:31.95]It is the floss.
[310:32.93]Holy shit, you're right.
[310:36.29]That's amazing.
[310:44.88]Okay, I wonder if A is the catch button or it's C. C is you jump in the air like a block.
[311:03.19]long does a quarter last in this game?
[311:04.71]Hopefully not that long.
[311:16.76]Come on.
[311:18.20]Sorry.
[311:21.56]Ten minutes?
[311:26.19]No.
[311:26.35]This is my drive right here.
[311:27.53]If I don't win right here, if I don't get a touchdown right here, I'm turning it off.
[311:41.67]Okay, we can talk a lot of shit if we want.
[311:43.31]Like, this actually is pretty good for an old 3DO game.
[311:45.67]Like, it's wide open.
[311:46.35]There's no way they don't catch us.
[311:54.77]What do you mean, bye?
[311:58.07]I'm still on.
[312:02.53]This plays pretty well for a game that's 20 fucking years old.
[312:05.39]More than that.
[312:11.65]Are they open?
[312:13.31]Let's be.
[312:14.11]Okay.
[312:15.51]Turn it off.
[312:18.47]No, I'm not turning it off yet.
[312:19.88]Not yet.
[312:24.92]Is it second and ten?
[312:34.12]Okay, run.
[312:42.91]Where's my blocking?
[312:43.61]Where's the blocking?
[312:44.23]That's where I was supposed to go to the left.
[312:46.01]Okay, I'm in trouble.
[312:49.17]Uh, Hail Marriott just into the end zone.
[312:52.78]Wait, I'm supposed to go right?
[312:54.86]Shit.
[312:55.04]Oops.
[312:56.54]Oops.
[313:14.28]Quarterback can't hold the ball that long.
[313:17.06]Okay, John, do you need any toilet paper?
[313:48.58]Give me a baseball game and I'll wipe the floor with everything.
[313:51.28]I don't play football.
[313:52.06]I don't know anything about football.
[313:53.09]I don't care about football.
[313:57.31]I don't know.
[313:57.93]I thought this was going to be a game where like John Madden grabbed his stomach and like shook it up and down a bunch of times.
[314:02.65]It was like, welcome to the game, punk.
[314:05.59]I don't know.
[314:06.83]I thought it was going to be like an FMV game.
[314:07.93]I didn't think it was going to be like an actual football game.
[314:27.85]The amount of question marks right there, I'm gonna be in the bath later, I'm gonna be laughing my ass off.
[314:32.56]That's a turnover!
[314:34.78]I need to get at least one touchdown.
[314:46.81]Oh my god, I'm fucking dying.
[314:54.13]Get it!
[314:54.37]Get it!
[314:56.25]Where is it?
[314:58.13]Sometimes you have to give credit for a fumble to the defense.
[315:00.97]Because that guy really made a hit.
[315:05.27]I gotta stop screaming, dude.
[315:06.95]I guess you turn it over and you punt immediately.
[315:16.07]Good work.
[315:29.79]Yeah, those things are pretty good.
[315:31.41]When they work, you look like a genius.
[315:34.31]Alright, let's punt it again.
[315:36.30]This time, for real, we're going to punt it.
[315:37.34]I mean, we're pretty far away.
[315:41.68]We're down by a lot of points.
[315:45.00]We're going to punt it?
[315:45.76]What a fucking idiot.
[315:46.66]I didn't even catch that.
[315:50.69]Fired that guy.
[315:53.39]That one didn't surprise anyone.
[316:09.80]Okay, good.
[316:10.94]Awesome.
[316:12.28]We're getting close.
[316:13.16]First and ten.
[316:13.88]I think we should probably punt it here.
[316:20.98]Isn't a punt here, if it goes through, you get points?
[316:23.11]Isn't there one guy ever in history that did that?
[316:25.25]Second and ten.
[316:40.87]The guy has his back turned to me.
[316:53.50]Touchdown.
[316:56.16]There it is.
[316:57.52]Are we in New England?
[317:06.62]Easy, yeah.
[317:07.08]Aim simple.
[317:15.30]Can I fake this?
[317:18.61]That's all I wanted to do.
[317:25.75]I just wanted to get one point.
[317:30.88]It's a fake.
[317:32.30]What do you got?
[317:36.74]I... This is me kissing somebody.
[317:38.82]No more kissing images.
[317:40.04]I don't... No, I'm not looking at it.
[317:41.38]I don't...
[317:56.33]It's me kissing Tom Brady?
[318:02.68]He saved it.
[318:04.00]Yeah, okay.
[318:11.95]This is actually kind of fun.
[318:29.21]Alright.
[318:29.45]Two minute warning that of what quarter?
[318:31.55]This is when super quarterbacks play super.
[318:35.63]Second quarter?
[318:45.14]I want one more possession with the ball.
[318:46.54]I'm going to tie the game, then I'm going to turn it off.
[318:53.64]Oh my God.
[318:55.08]Thank goodness he missed it.
[319:01.21]You got a Chuck, a Chuck E. Cheese juke?
[319:07.79]That's a word I don't, how, that's a sentence no one has ever, that's fucking up my brain.
[319:13.87]Chuck E. Cheese got a juke.
[319:16.32]What?
[319:17.10]That's not even, that statement is not making sense because it's not supposed to be real.
[319:20.32]They're punting it?
[319:28.42]Alright, they're actually going to punt it.
[319:29.96]What if they fake it though?
[319:38.14]You're gonna fake it.
[319:39.60]It's a fake punt.
[319:41.34]They watched me do it like ten times in a row and it worked.
[319:47.14]Hello?
[319:47.40]Can you do it?
[319:47.92]Shit, I almost had it.
[320:07.67]Alright, this is my last possession I'm going for.
[320:09.49]Let's see if I can get 14 points.
[320:11.12]Tie the game.
[320:13.94]And then everybody runs off the field.
[320:19.38]The New England Patriots have tied it up at 14.
[320:21.63]We all run into the clubhouse.
[320:24.71]Even with the timer still going.
[320:29.25]Chuck E. Cheese is spamming links.
[320:30.64]Ban him.
[320:38.13]Click that link.
[320:39.05]The Chuck E. Cheese link?
[320:43.17]What did he do?
[320:51.90]Oh, shit.
[320:52.66]You actually did get it.
[320:53.74]I thought people were just messing around.
[320:55.10]I saw, like, the half one.
[321:10.74]Where is it?
[321:16.61]Is it a fake link or did it actually happen?
[321:20.53]Delay of game.
[321:22.13]It's got a delay of game?
[321:23.77]Oh, god damn it.
[321:24.79]Alright.
[321:25.21]No.
[321:25.37]Alright.
[321:25.67]Stop.
[321:25.99]I'm done.
[321:28.18]Deep outs.
[321:28.60]Let's go.
[321:33.54]Why would I fake that?
[321:34.54]I don't know.
[321:44.10]Isn't this what Eli Manning's team did to the Patriots that one year?
[321:51.80]Eli Manning just threw like five Hail Marys in a row and they like accidentally got the Super Bowl.
[321:57.36]That happened, right?
[322:02.55]Eli Manning just turned his back and threw the football backwards as far as he could.
[322:06.39]Hold on.
[322:07.47]Okay, let's take a look at the halftime statistics.
[322:16.37]Come on, that's all we get?
[322:17.57]Points.
[322:22.80]First downs.
[322:24.90]Completion percentage, 35%.
[322:26.26]None of these stats matter who won the game.
[322:34.00]None of this matters.
[322:40.31]Am I actually kicking it off?
[322:42.31]Oh, that's not good.
[322:43.33]I lose.
[322:45.21]Did you hear Otto?
[322:46.07]Yeah, he was just like, let me in.
[322:50.71]I wanted to just get out, but let me back in right now.
[322:53.97]Otto.
[322:54.47]Otto.
[323:21.64]Get in.
[323:21.98]He's like, let me in.
[323:25.86]Alright, come on in.
[323:26.86]No, I don't want to go in.
[323:28.26]He rolls on his back, and he's like, I just, leave me alone.
[323:31.76]And he runs.
[323:32.14]It kind of just played itself, didn't it?
[323:49.87]It's six already, and Jerm is having so much fun that the stream hasn't ended.
[323:54.27]Yes, I get to see more 3DO.
[323:55.77]Can we tell him?
[323:59.21]Can we tell him this is the last five-minute string here of game until tomorrow?
[324:16.64]I love this console.
[324:17.36]I've been having a blast with it.
[324:19.49]Balls.
[324:19.79]Eh, it was alright.
[324:21.13]Everything else I loved.
[324:28.30]And we haven't even gotten to the real... What?
[324:31.50]Whose ball is that?
[324:32.86]I don't even care.
[324:41.57]Let's go.
[324:49.37]Promise me all time before the stream ends.
[324:52.43]Is that a game?
[325:01.84]Go with this one.
[325:04.02]Chuck E. Cheese Panasonic sellout.
[325:07.60]We're going to open tomorrow with Jurassic Park The Experience.
[325:12.28]I'm going to bounce.
[325:19.65]There's so many really good games left.
[325:21.23]I just didn't want to go into them hard today.
[325:23.35]This is the opener.
[325:27.02]We got some real shit tomorrow.
[325:33.05]We have Jurassic Park tomorrow.
[325:35.25]Possibly Psychic Detective.
[325:37.73]That one's going to be a real hit.
[325:38.79]I can already tell.
[325:40.39]Can't wait to play it.
[325:54.16]Jurassic Park.
[325:58.47]Road rash.
[325:58.97]That's right.
[325:59.33]Yeah.
[325:59.49]Tomorrow's going to be and some shitty ones too.
[326:02.35]What happened?
[326:05.85]I don't know.
[326:09.05]What was that?
[326:10.07]Pass attempt failed?
[326:11.59]You dropped the ball.
[326:12.31]Nobody even did anything.
[326:19.43]You're going to do wacky races again?
[326:20.85]I don't think we even need to.
[326:23.77]That was the perfect package for me.
[326:27.97]Why did you dive that way?
[326:32.02]Alright, I'm back.
[326:32.44]I lose.
[326:33.64]I lose, I'll see you tomorrow.
[326:38.60]Dude, Wicked 18 was pretty fun too, I'll tell you.
[326:40.22]Wink, what do you mean wink?
[326:49.73]Are you going to play Plumbers Don't Wear Ties?
[326:51.53]I don't have that.
[326:53.37]But I'm not against getting it.
[326:55.45]If there's no sex in it.
[326:56.75]By the way, also, I'm not going to play sex on the 3DO.
[326:59.31]There's a video game on the 3DO called Sex.
[327:08.76]Figured that was probably not streamable.
[327:16.04]I think it really is just porn.
[327:17.44]It's just porn on the 3DO.
[327:21.39]Which, gotta say, 3DO, you really messed up here.
[327:25.06]Imagine having interactive porn.
[327:28.98]This thing would have sold like hotcakes.
[327:32.22]It would have been on every single shelf.
[327:42.31]Instead, they wanted to have John Madden football.
[327:45.58]And not FMV 3DO porn.
[327:52.34]It would fucking suck.
[327:53.90]Not 25 years ago.
[327:54.78]Alright, that's it.
[328:06.55]I'll see you later.
[328:10.07]That Star Wars was fun.
[328:11.29]Everybody didn't want to give that chance.
[328:13.11]I might actually play that tomorrow.
[328:14.47]We might go to like level 5.
[328:15.77]I might just skip all the playing levels.
[328:25.38]But yeah, I want to give this thing a rest.
[328:28.56]It's been spinning for five and a half hours.
[328:31.72]It's scaring me.
[328:37.79]We lost to the New York Jets.
[328:39.03]No, I didn't.
[328:39.55]I abandoned the New York Jets game.
[328:45.25]It's a little different.
[328:47.51]We ran away.
[328:49.37]We didn't lose.
[328:49.93]We ran.
[328:53.39]You could say one's probably worse than the other, but still didn't lose.
[328:55.66]Alright.
[329:00.32]Good night, everybody.
[329:01.48]See you tomorrow.
[329:02.04]I'm going to start with Jurassic Park.
[329:07.31]It's an exclusive, by the way.
[329:11.81]Here come the credits.
[329:13.39]It was an absolute shitload of community subs today.
[329:16.65]I had a ton of fun.
[329:17.68]3DO is a lot of fun.
[329:18.40]It's just as good as I thought it was going to be, and there's so much more that we haven't even seen.
[329:23.48]See you tomorrow.
[329:27.46]Take care, guys.
[329:29.37]Here come the credits.
[329:32.05]There were a lot of subs.
[329:34.75]FTK news.
[329:35.43]We'll talk about it tomorrow.
[329:37.42]I will go over all the FTK details.
[329:40.64]Start times, pre-whitelisting of people.
[329:44.38]We're going to go over that tomorrow.
[329:55.97]It's really not going to be that complicated.
[329:57.49]It's going to be very, very streamlined.
[330:01.39]I've seen a demo of it twice by now.
[330:04.07]And I need to tell you, it's going to be great.
[330:09.03]It is way more than I thought it was going to be initially.
[330:11.91]I really do.
[330:18.01]I really did.
[330:21.97]But that'll be the end.
[330:24.25]Good night.
[330:26.67]Good luck to the rest of your things you're doing today.
[330:41.72]Alright, I'll give you Otto.
[330:43.36]You want to see Otto?
[330:45.06]Hey, Otto.
[330:46.44]You want to say hello?
[330:51.24]After the 7,000 people that were subscribed today, go bye.
[330:58.00]Otto, here comes an Otto reveal.
[331:01.80]He wants something too.
[331:04.16]He's looking at me like, alright, let's go.
[331:05.95]He's like, I'm ready to go outside, let's go.
[331:07.11]Alright, come here though.
[331:09.23]He's right at the door, he ran to the door.
[331:10.55]Come here, hold on.
[331:11.13]He's impatiently waiting for me to do something.
[331:21.87]Come here.
[331:30.26]Screen is muted?
[331:32.30]Hold on.
[331:42.01]Hey, hello, Otto.
[331:48.61]Like, why are you doing this?
[331:49.53]I want to... Let's go.
[331:50.84]Otto.
[331:55.04]I'm going to drop the 3DS controller.
[332:02.36]3DO.
[332:03.30]The 3DO controller was, like, on my lap, and it was just... About to fall.
[332:15.66]Alright, guys.
[332:16.18]I will see you tomorrow.
[332:18.55]Good night.
[332:18.95]And goodbye.
[333:02.13]Thank you.
