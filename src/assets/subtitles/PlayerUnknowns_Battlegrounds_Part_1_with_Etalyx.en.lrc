[01:49.27]I just wanted to make sure you guys, like, knew that he was around.
[01:52.95]Anyways, we're gonna play, uh... We're gonna play PUBG.
[01:57.73]PUBG Player Unknown.
[01:58.75]We're gonna play the VR Helmet Guy game.
[02:01.88]You know, the guy that, like, every time I see this on Steam, I've been, like, intrigued about it.
[02:06.50]Um, this is a guy with a VR helmet looking to the left with, like, a gun in his hand.
[02:10.72]I thought it was a VR game for, like, fucking three months.
[02:13.66]And then, uh, my buddy Etalyx, who, by the way, uh, just a short introduction here.
[02:17.86]Uh, Etalyx is here!
[02:19.89]I am.
[02:20.33]I am still here.
[02:21.19]I didn't leave when I was supposed to.
[02:22.83]Yeah, Etalyx, I thought this was a VR game.
[02:25.17]I was wrong.
[02:31.21]Yes, you were.
[02:32.13]Plus, it has a really weird name.
[02:33.71]It's all my fault.
[02:34.82]The stream is all my fault.
[02:37.04]Just wanted you to be aware.
[02:39.44]It's all your fault we're doing this, Etalyx.
[02:42.74]But yeah, Etalyx told me.
[02:43.94]Apparently, I'm very quiet, boy.
[02:45.88]You're very quiet.
[02:46.60]Well, now you won't be.
[02:48.90]Guaranteed.
[02:50.99]Go ahead, say something.
[02:53.09]Okay, how about now?
[02:54.35]Are we loud?
[02:55.39]He is no longer quiet, boy.
[02:56.87]Guaranteed.
[02:59.83]I can guarantee that one.
[03:03.21]So, um... You ready to, like, jump on in?
[03:07.97]I think I'm ready to jump on in.
[03:09.63]I think I like it.
[03:10.67]Wait, no, hold on.
[03:11.65]I'm clicking on shit.
[03:13.61]Click off, okay.
[03:15.47]We're ready to go, boys and girls.
[03:19.03]Go ahead and queue us.
[03:20.91]Okay.
[03:21.69]Uh, you... It's a two-person queue system.
[03:24.01]Oh, shoot.
[03:24.31]You gotta push ready as well.
[03:26.15]I'm ready.
[03:27.01]Both parties have to be ready.
[03:29.29]Let me, like, preface this by saying that I have absolutely no fucking idea what I'm doing.
[03:33.83]Yes.
[03:34.15]Not a clue.
[03:34.81]Etalyx is here.
[03:35.49]I have some idea.
[03:37.46]Yeah.
[03:37.68]Etalyx has a kind of an idea.
[03:39.46]I don't.
[03:39.72]I have one idea.
[03:44.40]So let's load into the game.
[03:48.22]You expected more on my stream?
[03:49.56]What do you mean you expected more?
[03:50.56]I don't even know how to play the game.
[03:52.32]It says in the title.
[03:56.33]It says I'm new.
[03:57.49]It says I'm a new player in the title.
[04:00.71]I gave him, like, the best, most expensive, like, school session on how to play this game that money can buy.
[04:09.51]It really was a lot of money.
[04:11.97]He's not kidding.
[04:12.55]Alright.
[04:14.93]Let me move that.
[04:17.21]Get this.
[04:20.18]Let's be really transparent about this.
[04:24.07]We played a few rounds.
[04:25.91]I did get a kill.
[04:27.21]I did get a guy.
[04:27.95]So anybody that wants to try to tell me that I didn't get a guy, I already did.
[04:31.05]There's a guy that's on fire now.
[04:34.05]That stat page is looking really good right now.
[04:36.40]Where are we going to go?
[04:37.50]Where are we going to drop down?
[04:39.78]Well... Right now you got... No, I'm kidding.
[04:49.89]We're just going to be patient.
[04:50.77]We're just going to kind of wait it out, and we're going to start in, I think, my favorite location on the east side of the map.
[04:57.69]Where that yellow marker is.
[04:59.30]So you want to go there?
[05:00.54]We're going to go to the pit.
[05:01.74]We're going to be pit people?
[05:05.46]Apparently, I think this is called the pit.
[05:07.62]I call it the crater.
[05:09.64]The crater, okay.
[05:10.86]Yeah, it's a better name.
[05:12.70]More syllables, but better name.
[05:17.11]Okay.
[05:19.53]Alright, so this is a popular area.
[05:22.11]I'm just letting you know.
[05:22.71]You're going to jump out in three, two, one, now.
[05:27.01]Alright, now, so you want to go, like, we're going to, like, slide over there, right?
[05:30.61]So if you look down, you see the little, there's, like, three or five warehouses surrounded by a rock wall.
[05:37.20]Sure.
[05:37.38]That's where we're going.
[05:39.86]I'm just going to follow you.
[05:41.56]Okay.
[05:42.76]I like to start on the two bigger warehouses on the far side.
[05:45.95]Alright, so are we going to go to The Simpsons place?
[05:49.75]Should I start at The Simpsons place?
[05:51.29]No.
[05:52.06]Homer Simpson, my coat.
[05:52.92]No!
[05:53.98]A lot of people like to land on the roof there.
[05:58.10]Am I going to instantly die?
[05:59.98]If you land on the roof, probably.
[06:01.34]Let's look at how many fucking people are here.
[06:03.36]Why are we going here?
[06:04.50]There's a lot of people here.
[06:05.30]It's okay.
[06:06.08]Look at all these sleeping bags that are landing.
[06:08.54]Alright, so you see the big warehouses?
[06:10.22]We're going to the big ones.
[06:11.12]I'm going to get shot out of the air.
[06:12.96]You're at the little ones.
[06:15.85]You're at the wrong one.
[06:16.69]No, I'm not.
[06:17.79]Okay.
[06:18.31]Hold on, I got this.
[06:20.03]It's just like that ride of the carnival.
[06:21.41]Alright, I'm already gonna die.
[06:22.37]Jerma's still learning how to loot, FYI.
[06:25.51]Oh, shit!
[06:26.36]I'm dead.
[06:28.66]You're already dead.
[06:29.44]Alright, that was fun!
[06:34.60]Well, I just killed a guy.
[06:36.84]I can just back out.
[06:38.40]There it is.
[06:39.78]Push spectate, and I'm gonna... I already exited the game.
[06:45.05]Don't even get to go out in a blaze of glory.
[06:47.49]You died in the middle of the concrete patch.
[06:49.97]Well, you put us in, like, this fucking place that was a million people.
[06:53.31]We got some training to do still.
[06:56.76]We got some training here to do.
[06:57.86]Hold on.
[06:58.04]I'm just going to kill this guy, and then I'm going to leave.
[07:00.06]I told you I was going to get shot out of the air.
[07:01.80]Did you see how many sleeping bags showed up there?
[07:04.38]That was not cool.
[07:09.59]Alright, I'm dead.
[07:10.31]We're leaving.
[07:10.79]Let's do it.
[07:11.35]Alright, I'm queuing up.
[07:13.45]Click to ready.
[07:13.99]Good round.
[07:16.89]That was a good start.
[07:17.85]That was a good beginning.
[07:19.45]You are correct.
[07:20.55]Dr. Mosquito is back.
[07:24.01]This is Mosquito MD.
[07:25.21]I couldn't make it Dr. Mosquito.
[07:26.61]The game wouldn't let me.
[07:28.11]It's kind of fucking bullshit if you ask me.
[07:31.63]This is the training montage.
[07:33.05]This is like the learning.
[07:35.57]There's learning happening right now.
[07:37.18]Whatever you say, fucking PUBG.
[07:42.27]I want everybody to know, before the stream happened, I said, so, Jerma, you want to go somewhere, like, slower, where there's fewer people, or somewhere where there's, like, a good amount of action?
[07:51.26]Guess which one we pick.
[07:53.46]Hey, how is I supposed to know?
[07:56.97]I'm just a fucking mosquito doctor.
[07:58.65]I don't know anything.
[08:04.63]You know what?
[08:05.41]This is an improvement compared to the norm.
[08:07.33]Have you noticed anything different about this stream compared to others?
[08:11.45]I'm getting called out right now on stream.
[08:15.95]How dare you turn my magnificent outro into a meme.
[08:18.53]You're a dead man.
[08:19.53]I'm getting called out on stream.
[08:20.74]See me at E3.
[08:22.86]I will do arm wrestling match at E3.
[08:24.98]Guaranteed I win.
[08:28.96]It's a guarantee.
[08:30.72]Because I'm just going to go like... It's going to be like 3, 2, 1.
[08:34.59]I'm going to go as hard as I can on the 1 and then fucking cheat and win.
[08:42.90]No, but hi.
[08:43.38]Hi, Muzok.
[08:43.82]How are you?
[08:45.94]Are you ready for take two?
[08:47.18]I'm ready for take two.
[08:47.91]This time, can we not instantly lose?
[08:49.81]Hey, are you talking to yourself?
[08:52.37]I didn't instantly lose.
[08:54.09]Yeah, you did.
[08:55.47]If I had a teammate there... Etalyx, we're a team.
[08:57.55]If I lose, you lose.
[09:00.83]Just because David Ortiz hits three home runs and the Red Sox lose the game, the team lost.
[09:07.74]The Red Sox lost by ten runs.
[09:08.88]Okay, we're a team.
[09:09.78]We are a team.
[09:10.62]You're right.
[09:12.51]I lost track of myself.
[09:14.15]Big Poppy can hit ten home runs in one game, but Red Sox can still lose that game.
[09:17.55]Alright, do you see Severny, like, northwest?
[09:20.37]Yeah.
[09:21.73]We're gonna go up there.
[09:22.50]We're gonna go to Laverne and Shirley.
[09:24.14]People do like to land here, though.
[09:25.78]3, 2, 1, go.
[09:26.20]I love how it does the Stone Cold Steve Austin glass break right when you press F. I'm just expecting it to be like...
[09:40.34]Alright, we're going to teach you how to land faster, so what you want to do is look at your target and hold W, and then when you get close enough that you think the parachute will carry you the rest of the way, you look straight down.
[09:49.38]Oh, you want me to just nose dive?
[09:51.26]Yeah, I want you to, once you get close enough, nose dive to the ground, hold W, if you think the parachute will carry you the distance that you want to go.
[09:59.81]This should, I think, yeah.
[10:02.71]And to land even faster, you want to hold W at the parachute.
[10:05.90]Okay, well, I'm like... But you're pretty far out there.
[10:07.86]You're pretty far away.
[10:08.80]The last time I landed right in the middle, I instantly died.
[10:10.90]Did you see how many fucking sleeping bags were there?
[10:12.94]Alright, this is parachute practice right now.
[10:15.58]I'm good.
[10:15.88]I'm on the ground.
[10:18.02]There's at least one other squad here.
[10:19.96]That's fine.
[10:20.64]Just try not to die.
[10:22.96]I'm going to go inside the fucking shed.
[10:25.19]I'm going to go inside the tool shed and see if I can find a wrench.
[10:32.66]Uh, they know we landed here, so they are going to be looking for us.
[10:35.84]Oh, what's that?
[10:36.48]Shotgun?
[10:37.30]Immediately?
[10:38.12]You got it.
[10:41.93]What was that?
[10:43.85]Extended mag?
[10:44.43]I don't even know what it is, but I'm taking it.
[10:45.67]Now, how many people did you say landed?
[10:52.08]Uh, there's two people that I saw.
[10:55.08]So it's a 2v2 situation.
[10:58.99]Uh, yeah.
[11:00.65]Or 1v2, depending on how you look at it.
[11:01.95]Alright, do you see anybody?
[11:03.15]If I come across, if I come over this hill with, like, a fucking... You can come to me.
[11:05.80]They're in the houses close to me, though.
[11:07.22]Okay.
[11:09.98]All I've got is a shotgun.
[11:11.38]Me too.
[11:12.44]Anything else in that house?
[11:14.22]Nope.
[11:15.98]So, they're in the house beyond this yellow house.
[11:18.73]Yeah.
[11:20.01]Uh, I think they're in the blue.
[11:21.37]The, like, baby blue.
[11:23.29]Baby blue house?
[11:23.81]That's, like, where he landed?
[11:26.25]I don't know if that's where he went in.
[11:28.21]So what you're saying is just go in here, guns blazing.
[11:31.29]Yeah.
[11:32.01]They're in here, or they were in here if they're not.
[11:35.34]Open door means there's someone that has been here.
[11:37.78]That's why you've got to close it behind you so Jason doesn't come in.
[11:41.80]Not in here.
[11:42.74]So they were in here, though.
[11:44.00]Okay.
[11:44.64]And there's nothing of interest in here?
[11:46.77]Nope.
[11:47.23]They already looted it and left.
[11:49.39]There's a hollow site, but we don't have any guns to use that.
[11:54.85]What is it?
[11:56.90]alright alright so we're kind of at a disadvantage now because we have shotguns and that's that's a disadvantage yeah that's a disadvantage okay uh I think I heard foot there in this house that I'm directly in front of yeah you think so so if we go in oh I can't go through that
[12:19.33]Etalyx, I can't go through there.
[12:20.55]Are you stuck on the wall?
[12:21.53]I'm trying to figure out how to climb through this.
[12:23.59]I'm still alive.
[12:24.31]They're directly to my right.
[12:25.85]They're ahead of you.
[12:26.87]One's in the house, one's flanking.
[12:28.05]Okay, well, here we go.
[12:30.59]He's going to come out.
[12:31.40]Is he?
[12:31.58]Right side?
[12:31.84]He opened the door.
[12:32.68]He opened the door.
[12:33.20]Is he going to be on my side?
[12:35.40]I got time, so he's in the window.
[12:37.36]Fuck me!
[12:43.41]Yeah.
[12:44.71]Disadvantaged with a shotgun.
[12:47.45]I don't even know you can shoot through those windows.
[12:49.95]I thought they were there for fun.
[12:50.97]Learning experience.
[12:52.33]This is my first real game playing this game, guys.
[12:55.17]Come on, give me a break.
[12:56.07]This says new to game.
[12:57.47]I've never played one of these games before.
[13:00.13]I played H1Z1 for five minutes and I said a poem to a guy and punched him in the face and exited the game.
[13:11.41]Baby's first game.
[13:13.91]I've never played one of these before, come on.
[13:18.47]Look, I thought this was like an early access game.
[13:20.11]Like you can shoot through the windows.
[13:21.39]Those windows didn't even look like real windows.
[13:27.54]You gotta push ready.
[13:28.96]Oh, I just got up.
[13:32.78]How many games have you played that was one of these that the windows you couldn't shoot through?
[13:37.29]Lots of them.
[13:38.81]In fact, I think all of them.
[13:40.75]Could you shoot through the windows in DayZ?
[13:43.55]Uh, you know, probably not.
[13:45.15]I didn't think so.
[13:45.71]Could you shoot through the windows in H1Z1?
[13:47.89]I don't know about that.
[13:48.99]That's what I thought.
[13:49.57]No, you couldn't.
[13:50.71]Maybe.
[13:51.17]Could you shoot through the windows in armor?
[13:53.28]Nope.
[13:54.00]Uh, I want to say yes.
[13:58.42]I mean, it is a military simulator.
[14:00.16]I have to assume that if you can shoot through light surfaces in armor, that you can shoot through windows.
[14:07.32]Why can't I find a crowbar?
[14:08.22]I want to be like Mr. Crowbar.
[14:12.54]The only thing worse in this game than pistols is melee.
[14:16.88]You can imagine.
[14:18.90]Thank you, Matters of Darkness, for $5.
[14:21.54]$5 on Muzok.
[14:23.84]How dare you?
[14:28.18]Could you shoot through windows in Final Fantasy XIII?
[14:30.59]Nope.
[14:33.11]Couldn't shoot through windows in Super Mario 64, could you?
[14:38.35]What?
[14:38.95]Oh.
[14:39.81]Okay, I just walked in the water and, like, that was very odd looking.
[14:49.29]So, do you want to land somewhere where we're not going to fight anybody?
[14:51.73]Is that what you want?
[14:52.61]No, no, no, no.
[14:53.81]Baptism by fire, man.
[14:54.82]I got to learn.
[14:56.08]Okay.
[15:01.66]We're not flying over anything that I like.
[15:03.74]I like to land at the school, but...
[15:06.96]There's too many people there.
[15:08.02]Alright, so where are we going?
[15:12.94]Alright, we're just going to go to Pachinki and there's going to be a ton of people here.
[15:16.57]My game is from... I can't press any buttons Etalyx.
[15:19.07]Alright, I'm waiting.
[15:19.83]3, 2, 1, go!
[15:20.53]Right?
[15:20.77]Oh, you already went.
[15:21.97]The game was like crashing.
[15:22.79]I had to do something.
[15:24.17]It's okay, I'm right near.
[15:26.69]I'm just going to follow you.
[15:27.31]Alright, so do not look straight down.
[15:28.98]Okay.
[15:29.30]I want you to look like your head is aiming at where you want to land.
[15:32.74]That's right.
[15:33.50]And then hold W.
[15:35.07]And where do we want to land exactly?
[15:36.04]And when you start getting close, then you want to look straight down.
[15:38.86]Like right now, I'm going to look straight down.
[15:40.42]Yeah.
[15:40.68]And you have like a speedometer at the bottom left.
[15:42.52]I'm going like 200.
[15:43.82]I'm going 200.
[15:44.44]Alright.
[15:46.44]And then when you parachute deploys, hold W. Right.
[15:50.58]And you will land faster.
[15:52.04]Alright.
[15:52.24]There's going to be at least three squads in this town.
[15:55.83]So do I have to look down too when I'm doing this or no?
[15:58.01]No, you can just hold W. Okay.
[15:59.51]Well, I'm going to land.
[16:00.07]We're going to go right on that house.
[16:01.37]Alright.
[16:01.97]I see another sleeping bag.
[16:02.81]Watch out.
[16:04.39]Try to prioritize the two story ones.
[16:06.31]Okay.
[16:09.55]Alright, there's a guy, like, dead ahead of us, but nobody has weapons yet.
[16:12.59]Come on, Etalyx, come on!
[16:14.47]The lag!
[16:15.53]Watch out, close the door behind you, watch out for the fucking, the horde!
[16:17.53]Is that you?
[16:22.15]Okay, I was about to just start punching you.
[16:23.98]Uh, armor vests, but we need guns.
[16:26.78]Alright, I got the vest.
[16:27.52]Anything in here?
[16:30.80]There's a guy outside, he could have a weapon, so... Shit, there's nothing in that room?
[16:35.15]No.
[16:36.69]Uh, here's a 1911.
[16:37.86]We need to go to the next house.
[16:40.54]Mic stock, micro is in.
[16:41.90]There's nothing in here for me.
[16:48.04]Oh, shit in my pants!
[16:50.26]Run!
[16:55.84]Okay, we're going to a normal area, Jerma.
[16:59.00]We're not going to action area, okay?
[17:02.42]You say you want it, but you don't actually want it.
[17:06.10]Dude, what the fuck?
[17:07.10]This game's not fair.
[17:08.19]Alright, well, in an ideal scenario, we're supposed to both split up and go to different houses.
[17:13.55]Yeah, but you're my chaperone.
[17:15.47]I gotta lead you around.
[17:16.43]I know.
[17:16.85]You don't bring me on a field trip and not, like, tell me where to go.
[17:20.35]What, are you gonna bring me to, like, the American Revolution town that you always go to?
[17:27.62]When you're, like, fucking eight years old.
[17:29.32]How many of you guys went to the American Revolution Town where people, like, pretended to be people of that time period?
[17:35.04]How many people?
[17:36.32]Daleks?
[17:38.00]And, like, did they, like, churn the butter and shit?
[17:39.78]And they're like, oh, we churn the butter here.
[17:41.58]We're going to less action area.
[17:44.46]Okay, we're going to go to the one where there's only, like, one other squad.
[17:47.32]Yeah, well, you left me with the butter churning lady.
[17:51.10]I can't do that.
[17:51.66]I have to be with you at all times.
[17:54.86]I know.
[17:55.50]That's why we gotta go to, like, lower action, so I can lead.
[17:57.93]You gotta push ready.
[17:59.09]Turn your graphics up?
[18:00.03]Is the game frozen?
[18:00.81]No, my game is frozen.
[18:02.37]Okay.
[18:04.31]Should it not be?
[18:04.81]Uh, it should not be, no.
[18:07.25]Should I get out of this?
[18:09.35]You should restart it.
[18:10.81]Oh, okay.
[18:11.47]Ladies and gentlemen, I will be right back in just a moment.
[18:21.70]Exit.
[18:24.46]I'm stuck here forever.
[18:28.32]I can't leave PUBG.
[18:30.87]It's here forever.
[18:31.57]You will play it forever and you will like it.
[18:33.89]Alright, well I have to open up the task manager now.
[18:38.55]Alright, not responding.
[18:39.44]End task.
[18:41.34]Tell me about how good that computer... I'm just kidding.
[18:44.26]Don't blame me.
[18:45.68]I know, it's the game.
[18:47.54]This game...
[18:51.39]No, we're not doing next.
[18:53.43]Don't you guys know that next is not allowed until 30 minutes at least in the game?
[19:00.23]You have to give it at least 30 minutes.
[19:03.21]That's not fair.
[19:03.91]That's not how we do next here.
[19:06.77]GTX 1080 LOL.
[19:08.07]Are you serious?
[19:08.65]That's like the best graphics card that's ever been made.
[19:11.57]Oh, look.
[19:12.15]He's playing with Etalyx and the game isn't working.
[19:14.22]I'm so surprised.
[19:16.10]That really is such a good pattern.
[19:20.60]Alright, I'm down here.
[19:22.18]I'm glad that it actually does that, though.
[19:23.51]Should I put on, like, a shirt?
[19:27.27]Okay, whatever.
[19:29.15]How much do I have to pay?
[19:29.91]Do I have to pay in-game currency?
[19:31.01]Do I have to pay PP points?
[19:35.39]You play rounds, and if you last longer than five minutes, you get currency.
[19:38.80]And then you buy boxes.
[19:42.36]Alright, we're going to, like, a learning zone, okay?
[19:45.32]Okay.
[19:46.80]We're going to go to a learning place.
[19:48.80]You're not ready for action place yet.
[19:50.84]No, I don't think I am.
[19:52.88]I think we've established that.
[19:56.43]What you need to do in each one of these starting areas is go pick up a gun and practice shooting people with it.
[20:03.35]Okay.
[20:04.29]By the way, sorry you could hear my air conditioner over there.
[20:06.06]I forgot to close the window.
[20:12.19]Last longer than, okay, the goal is to last longer than five minutes, right?
[20:15.67]Yes.
[20:16.37]So, we need to do it in a less dangerous zone.
[20:22.61]So, don't use the shotgun, right?
[20:24.19]Because I've heard everybody complain like, shotgun, fix it!
[20:27.22]Fix the fucking shotgun!
[20:29.36]It's pretty good if you are within ten feet and you hit them in the head.
[20:33.96]Isn't that, like, a big complaint about this game, though?
[20:35.66]It's like, oh, dude, shotgun, when is Daybreak gonna fucking fix their game?
[20:40.10]When is Daybreak gonna get off their ass and fucking do it?
[20:47.73]I know Daybreak didn't make this game, okay?
[20:49.53]Let's just be, like, easy.
[20:51.25]It was a joke.
[20:56.27]Okay, this is the one.
[20:57.19]We're gonna make it longer than five minutes.
[20:59.49]Guaranteed.
[21:00.77]Big Etalyx, guaranteed.
[21:03.92]Good.
[21:06.16]We're gonna go, like, somewhere boring.
[21:15.19]I love that we have to go somewhere boring.
[21:17.27]Yeah.
[21:18.37]Uh, there might be more people that land.
[21:19.66]Okay, you see the marker?
[21:21.39]Kind of like in the mountain.
[21:23.16]Just like a couple of stupid houses.
[21:25.64]This kind of reminds me of San Andreas.
[21:28.38]Are we going?
[21:28.76]Yeah, it kind of does.
[21:29.84]Alright, we're going now.
[21:31.74]Okay, I would love to go, but again, network lag detected.
[21:34.90]But I think I made it.
[21:40.73]You're going south.
[21:41.39]We need to go west.
[21:43.35]I just had some issues there.
[21:51.70]Can we get in a live timer?
[21:52.86]Wait, what do you mean Comcast at an hour?
[21:54.42]We're gonna get in a live time.
[22:04.11]Alright, there's two squads pretty far away from us.
[22:06.53]I think we're the only ones... I see one other guy.
[22:09.83]If there's something in this building, we can probably swarm, right?
[22:15.17]Uh, yeah.
[22:15.65]So what we want to do is split up, take different buildings, and just only look for guns.
[22:19.62]Alright, I'm going over here.
[22:21.97]only look for guns so there is one other guy and he's by you is he uh ish alright cool he's done he's gonna probably get this red house with me no there's just like trash on the ground I like fucking headphones alright I'm gonna rip these out of my fucking computer in five seconds I don't know what that is there's nothing in there there we go come on give me give me give me it's a fucking dumb shotgun but whatever
[22:55.01]We're getting really bad drops.
[22:57.71]Wait, there's an Uzi in here too.
[22:59.31]And a smoke grenade.
[23:00.85]Okay, take the Uzi for sure.
[23:02.20]Make sure it's at the full auto after you reload.
[23:07.18]Is the shotgun worse than the Uzi?
[23:09.56]Uzi's better.
[23:12.28]Unless you feel really confident in your aiming.
[23:15.22]Which I am not.
[23:16.00]So I'm coming to you.
[23:17.21]You said there was a guy over here with me?
[23:18.49]Yeah, there's a...
[23:19.79]There's one or two other guys I'm running to you.
[23:21.63]I've only got a pistol.
[23:22.43]Okay.
[23:23.37]I got a shotgun and an Uzi.
[23:25.31]Do you loot both of those houses or just one?
[23:27.35]Just this one over here.
[23:34.20]Okay.
[23:34.38]Let's get this two-story one.
[23:40.72]Pistol first aid kit.
[23:44.16]Go on.
[23:49.54]gas mask you go upstairs pretty much ignore all clothing unless it's armor ignore all clothing okay got you astray oh that's I already have that okay we're good hey do you have a helmet uh I do not hey Chad look I want you to know I'm giving him the armor okay I'm probably an armor streamer priority
[24:22.06]I think we're done here we gotta we gotta move up and find some different houses but uh we've got shotguns again somehow I got an uzi okay so what I want to do is go into these other buildings but this is where I saw the other guys okay too bad we have weapons that like you have to be within like three feet of them to hurt them yes
[24:54.89]Okay, this is not looted yet.
[24:58.01]Red zone has started.
[25:01.20]Crossbow?
[25:01.76]That's okay.
[25:03.60]Absolutely not.
[25:04.60]Don't use the crossbow.
[25:05.56]I forgot about the crossbow.
[25:07.08]That's the worst weapon in the game, probably.
[25:09.08]Really?
[25:09.26]Alright.
[25:09.96]I found a weapon for you if you want it.
[25:11.82]What you should do is pick up the M416 and let me have the Uzi.
[25:17.32]Let you have the Uzi?
[25:18.56]Yeah.
[25:19.26]Okay.
[25:21.12]So there you go.
[25:22.68]Now drop your 9mm.
[25:25.53]Drag it by dragging it out of your inventory to the left.
[25:27.75]I do.
[25:28.89]And then pick up the 5.56 for the weapon.
[25:31.73]Okay.
[25:32.05]And then load it up, and you're good to go.
[25:33.33]It's very cramped and crowded.
[25:36.16]I don't like this game.
[25:37.58]It's too scary.
[25:38.34]I'm, like, scared.
[25:39.14]Like, I'm more scared of humans than I am of zombies.
[25:41.46]So, here you go.
[25:43.72]Take this armor.
[25:46.20]Hold on.
[25:48.62]I have a smoke grenade.
[25:49.52]What should I do with it?
[25:53.55]Did I not take it off?
[25:58.30]Okay, never mind.
[25:59.34]I'm wearing the armor.
[26:00.44]You wear the armor.
[26:01.44]You're worth... I can't take it off for a second.
[26:03.58]On the value scale, you're worth way more.
[26:05.32]Alright, so at this point, we want to start being pretty cautious.
[26:08.94]We're going to have to move to a different set of houses because I'd be surprised if these haven't been looted already.
[26:17.38]I think around this area is where I saw them land.
[26:21.31]So just FYI.
[26:22.27]Okay.
[26:25.05]Yep, doors are open.
[26:29.75]We're just going to play it cool.
[26:37.86]So you picked up the M416 that has two firing modes as well.
[26:42.02]Yeah, I got it on full auto.
[26:44.94]It's all in full auto.
[26:46.94]Okay.
[26:47.44]I think the people that were here are either hiding or no longer here.
[26:53.19]I would assume.
[26:53.83]I don't see anybody.
[26:56.34]because I didn't loot these buildings.
[26:57.96]Did we?
[26:58.82]No.
[27:00.00]Okay.
[27:00.82]Now we're going, and if you thought it was scary before, now we have to run to the next area.
[27:08.37]What?
[27:09.63]No.
[27:09.83]Yeah, where other people have snipers and assault rifles and better armor and vehicles.
[27:16.93]Where's our president's limo?
[27:19.87]How come we don't have one of those?
[27:20.67]Well, if we come across a car...
[27:22.95]We'll probably take it.
[27:23.87]Is it true that the president's limo in an atomic bomb would survive the atomic bomb?
[27:27.57]Isn't that true?
[27:31.20]Like the refrigerator in Indiana Jones?
[27:32.78]Yeah.
[27:34.62]Well, yeah.
[27:34.90]Everybody knows that.
[27:36.94]Come on, check those water towers.
[27:40.62]Oh, I hear... We are running towards the gunfire.
[27:43.96]And it's just ahead of us.
[27:45.14]Okay.
[27:45.86]So they're going to be in this town and all I have is a micro Uzi.
[27:48.77]Well, I got an assault rifle.
[27:50.59]Just stay with me.
[27:52.42]Okay, so we're probably not going to get shot left or right, so I would say duck behind this wall and use third person to kind of... Okay, there's two guys.
[28:01.09]They're being shot at from somewhere else, I think.
[28:04.13]Are they right in front of us?
[28:07.19]I can't see over that.
[28:07.89]I can't see over that wall.
[28:09.06]Alright, come this way.
[28:10.26]He's right there.
[28:11.24]Literally right in front of us.
[28:12.24]Should I smoke him?
[28:12.84]No.
[28:12.90]No.
[28:15.83]There's three guys up there, so how we play this is going to be pretty important.
[28:19.17]My fucking heart is racing.
[28:20.19]I don't like this.
[28:20.69]I know.
[28:21.17]That's why the game is fun.
[28:22.27]No, I don't like this.
[28:22.81]Alright.
[28:23.50]There's a guy right there.
[28:24.54]So here's what you're going to do.
[28:25.66]I wish I had a real grenade.
[28:27.40]There's two.
[28:28.74]These guys are going to fight each other.
[28:30.02]Yeah.
[28:30.50]And then whoever is on the same team.
[28:32.64]Natural selection.
[28:33.36]One's standing on the left side of the wall, and one's on the right side of the wall.
[28:35.94]I wish I could shoot over this.
[28:37.04]There we go.
[28:37.30]Here we go.
[28:38.04]Big time.
[28:38.48]Big time.
[28:38.84]This is when we run in, right?
[28:39.58]We can shot it.
[28:40.02]Run, run, run.
[28:41.54]From where?
[28:42.91]think it was their bullets but I think we can handle this we're gonna move up while they're distracted alright he's he's right there got one is he dead he's dead there's another guy that he was running from I'm pretty sure
[29:04.64]But he was the last person in his squad, so his squad's dead.
[29:07.32]He has no teammate.
[29:08.44]If they die immediately, that means the other squadmate's dead.
[29:11.03]What about in here?
[29:12.25]Watch it.
[29:12.89]Watch it.
[29:13.13]It could be in there.
[29:15.41]Probably not, though.
[29:16.13]I haven't heard any wooden footstep sounds.
[29:19.87]This game is too scary.
[29:22.14]It's too intense.
[29:23.46]Like, my whole body aches.
[29:24.92]Okay, so just stay in cover?
[29:25.54]I didn't do anything.
[29:27.70]Just stay over here, like, peek around corners.
[29:29.86]Now, one thing you can do, if you hold right-click, hit Q, and you can switch shoulders.
[29:34.57]Oh, that's good.
[29:35.59]And then hit E, and you can switch back to normal.
[29:39.71]I like it over here.
[29:41.37]Let's go back to where we started, because that seems safe.
[29:44.49]Okay.
[29:47.46]I think there's one other guy, unless that guy killed the other guy.
[29:51.88]That's why we didn't pay attention to the kill feed.
[29:53.54]I'll go first.
[30:00.72]I do want to loot that guy, though.
[30:04.72]I'm going to risk it and go for loot.
[30:06.92]I'll cover you.
[30:07.32]Is somebody maybe in the toll booth?
[30:16.64]There's a box here.
[30:21.91]Police vest backpack?
[30:22.95]There's a UMP here.
[30:35.25]Did you take it?
[30:36.35]Yeah.
[30:36.45]Alright, what about a coat?
[30:39.13]Oh, nice.
[30:39.73]I'm such a badass.
[30:43.43]Let me take some of this.
[30:44.39]Okay, I don't see where the... There's a fourth guy somewhere.
[30:51.20]I count three boxes right now.
[30:52.70]One, two, and three.
[30:54.22]So I don't know where the other guy is.
[30:55.20]There's a military vest level three on me.
[30:57.18]Okay.
[30:58.40]I don't know what any of this fucking means.
[30:59.92]I thought that was a bra.
[31:00.76]Should I get the bra?
[31:01.38]Alright, I got it.
[31:02.92]Put the bra on.
[31:06.02]okay you pretty much can ignore just take the military vest off of this guy off the one I'm standing on and put it on yourself military vest yeah it's at the top yeah I got it oh I heard a I heard a firework I hear like something else too what's that plane what is that uh cargo drop it basically is like super special loot if you manage to get to it uh do you see the painkillers on this one alright you want those painkillers
[31:34.18]Oh, I took those painkillers already.
[31:35.62]Isn't that a game?
[31:36.60]Painkiller already?
[31:39.50]Wait, no, isn't that like a Woody's Gamertag podcast?
[31:43.58]Hey, how much 552k do you have?
[31:45.30]Painkiller already?
[31:46.46]What is it?
[31:46.80]What is it?
[31:47.28]I need to know.
[31:47.80]Tell me it.
[31:48.84]I don't know.
[31:49.36]I have no idea what you're talking about right now.
[31:51.70]What is the name of Woody's Gamertag's podcast?
[32:01.62]You know what's really freaking me out right now?
[32:03.34]You're, like, behind me all the time.
[32:05.56]It, like, scares me.
[32:06.52]I feel like I'm about to be attacked at any moment.
[32:13.48]Alright.
[32:14.14]How much extra ammo do you have for your main gun?
[32:17.00]I have none.
[32:19.44]Okay.
[32:20.11]That's great.
[32:21.77]That's good.
[32:22.35]Alright.
[32:22.81]Let's go.
[32:23.15]We're leaving the house.
[32:23.91]Alright.
[32:24.13]Let's go.
[32:24.67]Wait a minute.
[32:25.15]We need to look out the windows because they can't shoot through them.
[32:28.92]Get the mail, too.
[32:30.06]I mean, it is a good idea to peek out the windows, so you're not wrong.
[32:33.68]It's a good idea to use that third person.
[32:35.52]Should we check the toll booth and make sure there's nothing in here?
[32:40.59]There is an extended mag for, I don't know.
[32:44.03]I don't know what any of this stuff means.
[32:45.19]I'm sorry.
[32:49.29]I just feel like there's another guy around here somewhere.
[32:58.53]Alright, you ready to move to the next area?
[33:00.11]Yeah.
[33:01.19]See how it just said, like, you got three minutes, 20 seconds to get to the next area.
[33:04.87]And the area has, the circle has closed in.
[33:08.69]Wait, that was my gun?
[33:10.13]Hold on, wait a minute.
[33:10.69]Apparently that was my gun.
[33:13.37]Guys, this is the first time I've ever played this fucking game.
[33:15.80]Like, can I get, like, can I get a second?
[33:19.62]Like, holy shit.
[33:20.54]I'm not gonna be an expert.
[33:21.66]I don't have 4,000 hours in PUBG.
[33:24.06]I apparently, like, left an extended mag for my pistol.
[33:27.02]Oh.
[33:28.25]You'll never use it anyway.
[33:29.25]Look at the fucking title.
[33:30.40]The title says new to game, not I've played PUBG for 3,000 hours.
[33:34.06]This is the first time I've ever played it.
[33:41.42]And if you start thinking that you're getting shot, just keep sprinting, don't panic, and tap A and D to zigzag a little bit.
[33:49.74]Most people in this game will not be able to kill you.
[33:52.10]If you zigzag?
[33:53.35]Yeah, like, if you just zig a little bit, if they're sniping at you, unless you're running straight at them, they most times will not be able to hit you.
[34:00.35]Is there a stamina or anything in this game?
[34:02.27]No.
[34:02.55]Okay, good.
[34:05.55]So we're going to go down here to this other area, kind of southeast, and there's probably going to be a bunch of people here.
[34:11.73]We're actually in a terrible location, and it's all my fault.
[34:16.01]Because I'm running in an open field.
[34:19.39]Yeah, I feel like this is not that safe.
[34:21.08]We're kind of just, like, free roaming.
[34:22.38]It's not, no.
[34:26.92]Okay, so what we're going to do is just press X to put the gun away.
[34:29.04]Yeah, that's what I did.
[34:31.49]And you can move a little faster.
[34:34.31]So if we get sniped right now, I take responsibility.
[34:38.03]Yes, we've survived the first 54.
[34:42.83]We are in the top 50 percentile now.
[34:46.40]Yeah, you guys didn't think I was going to make it to the top 40, did you?
[34:49.50]Just like the billboards.
[34:51.04]I'm finally going to make it to the top 40.
[34:52.32]Okay, about now you want to pull the gun back out?
[34:56.00]Mm-hmm.
[35:00.01]And just assume that we're not the first people here.
[35:02.37]Right.
[35:06.99]Oh, it's a good idea to crouch in front of windows and kind of peek in.
[35:12.39]This is a bad spot that I'm in.
[35:16.83]Doors are open, which means people have been here already.
[35:19.59]It means somebody was here.
[35:28.14]Still 40 gas.
[35:30.26]So a couple strats, pro strats, that people use is to kind of stick around the outside edges of the play area and just keep slowly moving in because people who are outside it are going to keep running inward.
[35:43.77]So if we're looking outward, like those shots right now are... Restricting the area.
[35:50.40]Yeah.
[35:51.30]So in 28 seconds, the blue circle is going to be moving closer.
[35:54.12]Okay.
[35:56.04]So we're fine.
[35:57.14]We can chill here.
[35:57.94]We can move to another area that we don't think has been looted.
[36:02.78]Top 40.
[36:03.40]You make the call.
[36:04.10]Do you want to go loot somewhere else?
[36:05.68]Do you want to hang out here for another minute or two?
[36:08.48]Let's hang out here and drink some Dos Equis, and then we'll fucking take off.
[36:11.49]Okay.
[36:11.95]I'm going to go check out the other house.
[36:14.27]That might actually be olive oil.
[36:15.33]I think there might be someone in this house.
[36:18.03]Somebody in this house.
[36:20.29]I only thought I heard one footstep, but I'm not sure.
[36:24.44]If they were here, they're going to be upstairs.
[36:26.42]Well, be careful.
[36:29.84]And if they're upstairs, advancing on stairs is a good way to get killed.
[36:34.04]Yeah.
[36:34.92]I have a smoke grenade.
[36:35.64]You want to smoke the stairs and we'll just run up?
[36:39.06]Smoke the stairs.
[36:39.74]Alright, you ready?
[36:40.84]There's probably no one in here, but just do it.
[36:43.26]Here we go.
[36:43.54]We're going to smoke the stairs.
[36:44.32]At least everyone else will know we're here.
[36:46.08]And in three, two, one, smoking stairs.
[36:50.12]And... I'm closing the front doors.
[36:56.17]There's the fucking police!
[37:01.23]Nobody's there.
[37:01.77]Yeah, nobody here.
[37:04.73]There's a car, though.
[37:06.67]Okay, so, here's an important lesson.
[37:08.55]Look at the top of your screen.
[37:09.70]Do you see when you turn left and right, it's a compass?
[37:12.12]Mm-hmm.
[37:14.08]So if you see somebody, you, like, if they're east, 75.
[37:17.36]Let's wait for the one guy to come up here.
[37:19.44]The guy thinks he's gonna get a jump on us.
[37:20.94]Watch.
[37:23.12]He's gonna be like, holy shit, the building's on fire.
[37:24.74]I gotta put that out.
[37:25.84]I gotta go put that fire out.
[37:27.04]I'm gonna get in deep trouble.
[37:28.84]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[37:31.08]Do you see people?
[37:31.76]Why is there, like, explosions everywhere?
[37:33.74]Uh, that is a zone getting shelled randomly by the red area.
[37:37.64]Who killed 25 people?
[37:39.66]What was it?
[37:40.47]16 people to get the AR for 14?
[37:42.57]What the hell?
[37:43.01]What is it called?
[37:44.07]What?
[37:45.09]The AC-130.
[37:45.77]The helicopter in Call of Duty that when you get, like, 14 kills flies around and bombs things.
[37:50.59]Sure.
[37:51.09]Killstreak.
[37:51.61]Yeah, it's Killstreak.
[37:52.55]Yeah.
[37:56.00]Is that you moving around?
[37:57.38]Yes.
[37:57.94]Okay.
[38:00.18]Panic.
[38:00.70]Panic mode.
[38:01.92]Hey, top 40.
[38:02.40]We are in the top 37.
[38:03.12]Hey, we have to get to my age.
[38:04.74]As long as we get to my age, I'll be okay.
[38:06.85]Alright.
[38:07.09]So we're just going to kind of hang out here for a little while longer until the blue area right, which is right now moving towards the white.
[38:14.01]Right.
[38:15.57]And you can see that on the map.
[38:16.67]It's almost there.
[38:19.29]So if anybody was going to be coming from outside the boundary, they were going to be coming from the west.
[38:22.64]They would be coming from the west.
[38:23.62]Okay.
[38:23.74]Okay.
[38:30.90]I actually had a firefight in this exact house yesterday.
[38:33.70]Really?
[38:34.66]How do you get footprints on the wall like this?
[38:37.89]How does that make any sense?
[38:39.35]Somebody's walking on this wall?
[38:40.53]There's a car outside.
[38:42.77]Okay, apparently, be careful because fucking Venom is here.
[38:45.74]Like, Spider-Man is, like, in the house.
[38:49.42]Okay, so there is a car.
[38:50.08]A car?
[38:51.89]You should be able to see it.
[38:52.79]There's two cars.
[38:53.57]There's a blue car.
[38:54.97]You might be able to, like... I don't think there's anyone in it, though, is there?
[38:57.86]Did anybody sit in the passenger?
[38:59.22]What's the bullet drop like?
[39:00.08]I think there's a guy there.
[39:02.36]Do not account for bullet drop at this distance.
[39:04.30]Just aim where you... It's not in the car.
[39:06.26]He got out.
[39:06.56]There's nobody in that car.
[39:08.30]It's just slowly rolling.
[39:09.23]It's just rolling backwards.
[39:10.89]Should we steal the car?
[39:12.83]No, he's, like, here.
[39:13.87]Oh, he's here?
[39:14.99]Oh, no.
[39:15.55]I don't want him to be here.
[39:17.95]I don't want him to be here.
[39:20.96]Hey, we made it to 31.
[39:21.44]We're okay.
[39:23.12]We're good.
[39:27.16]What if somebody was actually just sitting in there?
[39:29.02]This is like a bait to me.
[39:31.12]Somebody dropped us.
[39:31.86]It's like a fucking rabbit trap.
[39:33.73]Just make sure you don't sit in the window for too long.
[39:36.51]Because other people have scopes.
[39:38.41]We don't.
[39:40.43]What do you mean other people have scopes?
[39:42.21]Yeah, like four-time scopes.
[39:43.83]Like sniper scopes.
[39:45.95]We have iron sights.
[39:47.31]We didn't find any scopes.
[39:49.71]uh it's like a potion basically where it heals you over time very slowly so you can kind of like pre-pot before you get into a fight how do I do I just how do you I'll just you're right right click it okay if you have a bunch of them you may as well go and use one now I have like three I don't see anybody just go ahead and use one just use one
[40:13.28]Yeah.
[40:14.10]Alright.
[40:14.46]We need to move.
[40:15.48]We have to go pretty far inwards, and this is where we're going to die.
[40:18.84]Wait.
[40:18.96]Does it take, like, three seconds to use it?
[40:21.94]Yeah.
[40:22.14]You have to right-click it and, like, sit there.
[40:23.60]Okay.
[40:24.50]So tell me when you're ready.
[40:25.26]We're going to go try and get one of those cars.
[40:26.84]Okay.
[40:27.96]I'm ready.
[40:28.30]You ready?
[40:32.60]Which side was it on?
[40:34.00]It was, I think, on the other side.
[40:37.16]Did I just run all the way around the wrong way?
[40:38.76]I think you may have.
[40:40.50]Okay.
[40:41.14]Yeah, it's right there.
[40:42.30]Very disoriented.
[40:45.14]Now, he could still be in the trees up here, or it could have just been out of gas.
[40:48.18]I'm telling you, this is a trap.
[40:49.48]This is a trap.
[40:51.20]He's sitting there.
[40:51.86]This is like Wile E. Coyote in The Roadrunner.
[40:59.02]Car sucks.
[41:02.14]Alright, let's do it.
[41:03.56]What do we got for a play area?
[41:04.96]Alright.
[41:07.32]Oh, I hear something.
[41:09.41]We're just gonna ignore it because we have a long way to go to get to the player.
[41:12.22]So if I see or hear anyone, I'm just gonna swerve and hope that their aim sucks.
[41:17.24]That's gonna make me sick.
[41:19.16]That's gonna actually make me fucking puke.
[41:22.16]Should I not be leaning out of the car?
[41:23.28]What if I get smashed in the face?
[41:26.45]Nice turn.
[41:34.75]Hey, an airdrop.
[41:35.67]Should we go for it?
[41:37.10]I mean, no.
[41:39.38]No, but we're kind of heading that way anyway.
[41:41.84]So I should be ready for anything, right?
[41:42.88]There might be like Five Guys.
[41:44.97]That's not a spawn for a car.
[41:46.23]There's probably people in that house.
[41:47.47]Got him.
[41:50.31]Was that you?
[41:50.95]No.
[41:51.41]Yes.
[41:52.51]Okay, because it actually didn't sound like you for some reason.
[41:56.88]That actually was pretty accurate.
[41:58.94]Oh, what have you done?
[42:02.14]We're fine.
[42:03.90]We're good.
[42:06.39]Are we driving around like dickheads right now?
[42:12.01]Alright, so here's what we're going to do.
[42:13.33]What are we going to do?
[42:14.23]What's the plan?
[42:15.41]We're going to park up here and then run down.
[42:20.67]Even though that sounds dumb.
[42:22.97]Alright.
[42:23.17]Okay, we're going to run down to those two houses.
[42:28.56]Run down to the two houses.
[42:30.18]And then we're going to have to run back up.
[42:31.82]So I know it sounds dumb...
[42:33.59]This is a tiny little play area.
[42:34.95]They're going to be everywhere.
[42:36.43]Yeah, there's 27 alive, so there's like 12 or 13 teams.
[42:39.81]This is just anxiety.
[42:41.35]This is anxiety the game.
[42:45.13]It's just, hey, do you want to have anxiety while you play a game?
[42:47.24]Just here it is.
[42:47.80]Alright.
[42:50.58]Listening for footsteps.
[42:54.54]They can hear our footsteps, so they're prepared for us.
[43:00.30]Shut the door behind you.
[43:06.86]pretty sure this has been looted already but uh so they we all have to be like right here yeah we actually have to move again we have to move again but I just wanted to look and see hey look see this is worth it first aid kit you can take it if you can fit I have two I have still tier one backpack so so just take it um what about the what about the Red Bull
[43:32.45]Here, give me the Red Bull.
[43:33.41]Oh, shit.
[43:33.87]How do I drop one?
[43:35.11]Drag it left.
[43:36.13]I dropped all of them.
[43:37.47]Okay.
[43:38.70]Okay.
[43:40.14]I'm just going to drink one.
[43:41.58]We got 57 seconds, and we have a car up the hill, so we should be okay.
[43:47.84]You got first aid kit.
[43:48.80]I'm just going to keep the Red Bull for now.
[43:51.00]So you use the first aid kit the same way.
[43:52.26]You just have to right-click it and stand still.
[43:54.32]What I did is bind all of my healing items to different keys.
[43:57.98]I haven't.
[43:58.26]I got to do that.
[43:58.85]Did you leave the house?
[44:01.59]Yeah.
[44:03.21]Leaving the house and heading back up the hill.
[44:05.37]Okay.
[44:05.89]Oh, God.
[44:06.11]Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[44:08.91]Where are they?
[44:09.99]Come over here.
[44:10.47]Turn to the right.
[44:11.07]Turn over here.
[44:12.07]How far?
[44:12.63]I'm right in front of you.
[44:16.17]Right in front?
[44:18.19]It's too much anxiety.
[44:19.45]No, like this way, this way, this way, this way.
[44:21.00]Oh.
[44:24.16]It's too much.
[44:25.14]It's too much too quick.
[44:26.48]I got a couple of shots on one guy.
[44:28.44]So they're close?
[44:29.30]They're right fucking here.
[44:30.54]They were running up this hill.
[44:31.56]Like around this house.
[44:35.86]They ran through here, and I shot the guy like four times.
[44:38.96]He's not dead.
[44:40.76]He's very much alive.
[44:41.58]There he is, there he is, there he is.
[44:45.26]Didn't hit anybody.
[44:47.26]I didn't hit one person.
[44:48.00]Alright, just take cover.
[44:53.62]Careful.
[44:53.88]Stupid SMG.
[44:54.38]They're going to get the car.
[44:56.92]Are they?
[44:58.21]If they see it.
[44:59.88]Careful.
[45:00.96]Stick behind cover.
[45:02.38]The fucking fence is not covered.
[45:04.66]We gotta run.
[45:05.36]What do you mean we're gonna run?
[45:06.42]Oh my god!
[45:08.42]How do I run faster?
[45:09.78]Just run.
[45:11.30]Just run this way.
[45:12.02]They're gonna either have to run or turn and fight us.
[45:14.84]No, no, no, no, no.
[45:17.42]Alright, so when you get to about half health, what you want to do is just stand still.
[45:22.19]And use a medpack, okay?
[45:23.59]Oh, God.
[45:24.81]When does it stop?
[45:25.41]Is it going to stop?
[45:26.15]It's going to stop when it meets with the white.
[45:28.07]These guys are on the left.
[45:29.19]Yeah, but save with the trees.
[45:30.68]I see them.
[45:31.14]There's our car.
[45:32.56]Yep.
[45:33.26]Should we get in the car?
[45:33.98]They're at the top of the hill.
[45:35.64]Yep.
[45:36.00]He sees us.
[45:37.38]Hop in.
[45:37.90]Hurry.
[45:41.34]This is a bad idea.
[45:43.33]Get us out of here.
[45:44.91]How do I use my first aid kit, right?
[45:47.11]You can use it right now.
[45:50.79]Why am I not using it?
[45:53.33]Use.
[45:53.85]I think you can use it.
[45:54.97]No, I can't.
[45:56.13]Alright.
[45:56.73]Well, we are here.
[45:57.82]We're in the circle.
[45:59.00]Oh, my.
[46:02.96]Okay.
[46:03.32]This is fine.
[46:04.88]This is fine.
[46:05.18]Just get out of here.
[46:05.86]Get out and heal?
[46:07.47]Take cover in front of a tree.
[46:08.93]Oh, God.
[46:09.37]Too late.
[46:10.09]Just cover me.
[46:13.18]Using my first aid?
[46:14.78]All I have is a UMP.
[46:16.48]I have 13 shots in my gun.
[46:19.00]What's your other gun?
[46:20.02]I have a shotgun and I have a pistol.
[46:22.55]Okay, yeah, we're totally dead.
[46:24.07]And I have a smoke grenade.
[46:25.51]We are totally undergeared right now.
[46:27.53]Don't you fucking worry about it.
[46:28.91]When we see them, I'll drop the smoke grenade.
[46:31.93]That's something at least.
[46:32.87]Take that.
[46:33.53]Put it on your gun.
[46:34.49]Make those 13 shots count.
[46:36.39]How do I put it on?
[46:37.95]Drag it over to the gun.
[46:39.59]Red dot sight.
[46:40.51]You ready to move up?
[46:41.35]I'm ready.
[46:45.78]we know that there's guys to the left we don't know right so what we want to do is just keep rock for cover yep like rocks or trees just be aware that people can be coming up from behind us god this is like so small there's too many people in the small areas there's 17 people alive
[47:07.25]Uh... Alright, what if I do, like, a distraction?
[47:10.13]And throw, like, a smoke grenade?
[47:11.47]No, don't shoot!
[47:12.45]No, no, just throw the smoke grenade.
[47:13.97]Just throw it anywhere?
[47:14.69]Alright, there's a house up ahead.
[47:15.87]I saw the door shut.
[47:17.45]They're in the yellow house.
[47:18.95]They're in yellow house.
[47:19.61]Got it.
[47:20.15]Yeah.
[47:21.61]So if we run there, we're probably gonna die.
[47:23.35]Okay, well, I just threw a smoke grenade.
[47:24.41]They're gonna freak the fuck out.
[47:25.23]There he comes.
[47:25.61]Here he comes.
[47:25.91]I can see him.
[47:26.31]I can see him in the window right now.
[47:33.71]Can't even fucking shoot through windows in this game.
[47:36.72]Did he shoot back?
[47:37.36]Yeah, but I don't think he knows where we are.
[47:40.44]Okay, he doesn't know where we are, but he shot back.
[47:42.62]Okay.
[47:45.26]Right, yeah, gotcha.
[47:47.62]Look, they're so confused.
[47:48.84]It was a beautiful tactic, dude.
[47:50.62]They have no idea.
[47:51.00]Because they can't see.
[47:52.78]He's outside the house.
[47:53.64]He's coming up to the fence on the right.
[47:56.55]Oh, you got some hits.
[47:57.19]There's a guy in front of that guy.
[47:59.43]He's to your right.
[47:59.93]He's peeking.
[48:03.25]I can't shoot at him.
[48:04.57]It's over.
[48:05.23]I have no bullets left.
[48:06.81]Okay.
[48:07.35]So just hide behind the rock.
[48:08.55]He has to come to you unless he throws the grenades.
[48:10.96]Okay.
[48:13.44]Bandage up if you can.
[48:15.26]Make sure you're in a safe spot.
[48:17.60]They're behind us.
[48:18.90]Or to the east.
[48:20.26]And we have to move towards the house in a minute and a half.
[48:23.87]This is too much for me, man.
[48:25.47]We're physically forced to go to the house in a minute and 20 seconds.
[48:29.51]I'm concerned about... He's here.
[48:31.81]He's on your right, right, right.
[48:34.16]Get out of my fucking town.
[48:36.16]We're good.
[48:36.74]Okay.
[48:37.22]There's one.
[48:37.58]There's got to be one more.
[48:39.14]You want me to just be bait?
[48:40.79]And just run?
[48:41.23]We'll just sprint in there?
[48:42.01]No.
[48:42.29]We're top 13 right now.
[48:43.89]There's only like six teams.
[48:45.93]Ah!
[48:51.30]It's so fucking... I don't like it.
[48:53.46]It's too...
[48:59.75]This is scarier than a fucking scary game of Talents.
[49:03.18]This is too scary.
[49:04.70]I'm sorry that you died.
[49:13.94]You didn't leave yet, right?
[49:14.96]No, I'm still watching you.
[49:16.62]This is fucking too terrifying.
[49:17.92]I can't play these games.
[49:22.14]You can watch me whiff this guy and miss all my shots.
[49:26.46]Well, it's like, okay, I was looking over at chat, and then, like, you were talking, so I was like, oh, my God.
[49:35.73]Where the fuck was this guy?
[49:38.15]Where the fuck is this person?
[49:41.11]That's what I don't understand.
[49:42.41]Hey, we were number six.
[49:44.31]Dude, that's, like, so fucking, like, that's why I don't like it.
[49:47.57]Where the fuck was this guy?
[49:49.74]We got top six.
[49:50.90]No, what happened there was we both got fucking stung by bees.
[49:55.24]by the most deadly beast.
[49:56.74]Like, we just got killed by, like, fucking bees.
[50:01.80]Caught me with my pants down.
[50:03.01]That was like another guy.
[50:05.67]Wait, let me see.
[50:08.47]Number six with one kill.
[50:10.13]How bad was my scream?
[50:12.44]Screamed oh god get out of my fucking town I probably screamed like a fucking psycho I was a little scared.
[50:20.67]I'm gonna pretend like I wasn't So now that we've made it to like around top 10, that's the actual game
[50:40.10]I like it.
[50:41.02]The game's fun, but I would rather play Resident Evil 7.
[50:48.14]It's more scary than a horror game.
[50:50.06]Well, when you play a scary game, you know that they're trying to jump scare you at any moment.
[50:55.49]A game like this, there's a hundred jump scares in here.
[50:59.69]All these people are jump scares.
[51:01.33]That's all these people are.
[51:03.00]They're not strategically placed, it's not like oh when I go- I'm gonna go down this hallway, I know there's gonna be a jump scare.
[51:08.00]No there's just a hundred random jump scares.
[51:11.00]Yeah. Yeah but it's the- that's the adrenaline, like if that's what's fun because you never know. They could be there, they could be over there, they could be there.
[51:17.00]I mean it's true.
[51:18.00]That's the fun part... Alright so we're- see this is what I do. After like a tense game where you're still feeling in the adrenaline we just go to a hot zone.
[51:29.40]We just go to a hot zone and intentionally know we're going to die, but just try to TD him.
[51:36.68]Takes the load off.
[51:39.70]Okay.
[51:40.37]So where's the hot zone?
[51:43.35]Depends on where we're going to be flying over.
[51:44.85]I want to fly over the crater again.
[51:47.09]The crater?
[51:49.83]Or the pit.
[51:51.03]I can definitely see the appeal.
[51:52.17]That's for sure.
[51:52.99]I can see the appeal.
[51:56.31]The appeal is very much there.
[52:00.69]You'll learn to appreciate it.
[52:02.32]Aim down sights like Grandma Griffin, Steve.
[52:05.34]Okay.
[52:10.84]Do you see my marker on George Pole?
[52:13.87]George Washington?
[52:14.53]Yep.
[52:15.23]Yeah, that is like a really big hot zone.
[52:17.29]There's going to be a ton of people there.
[52:18.45]Okay.
[52:20.29]Three, two, one, go.
[52:22.87]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[52:28.71]Okay, so do you see on the left-hand side of all those, like, shipping crates?
[52:35.65]No, you're looking too far if you're looking at the bridge.
[52:37.51]Look at the, like, multicolored, like, blue, red, yellow.
[52:40.94]That one map in Battlefield 3.
[52:42.68]That was, like, the only map that anybody played to do, like, the TDM.
[52:46.50]You see the three bigger buildings side by side.
[52:49.02]Yes, I see the guy that has the fucking almost four hotels on his property in fucking Baltic Avenue.
[52:54.75]I see it.
[52:56.43]Okay, I'm going to the left-most warehouse.
[52:59.67]Okay.
[53:01.41]Dude, be careful when you land on this.
[53:02.85]You're gonna have to owe, like, 700 bucks to, like, whoever owns the fucking property.
[53:10.63]Don't you be coming back here now.
[53:12.45]Alright, I already see a gun.
[53:19.33]Pick it up.
[53:19.79]Shoot first person I see.
[53:21.41]Shoot the first person you see.
[53:22.25]The first fucking person I see.
[53:23.16]You got it.
[53:23.66]Doesn't even matter if it's me.
[53:29.21]what ammo is this even for I don't even know this one there's a guy behind you okay Jesus Christ don't punch me is he dead I can't do it it's too scary this is me I'm with you did you shoot me I don't like this game I swear to god dude why is this on not on full auto
[53:58.81]There's a guy in here with me.
[54:01.26]Why am I doing these, like, fucking screams, man?
[54:03.82]I'm sorry, guys.
[54:04.80]I don't, like, normally scream like this.
[54:10.02]I'm dead.
[54:13.82]I literally can't play this game.
[54:16.70]It's just, like, there's too much going on at every second.
[54:22.76]I turn around, there's just people all, like, I'm too high-strung to play this game.
[54:28.46]Come on.
[54:29.04]Come on, Jeremiah.
[54:30.02]Keep it together.
[54:33.94]I'm like so fucking neurotic.
[54:36.57]I can't play this game.
[54:38.45]Did you quit or are you still spectating?
[54:39.73]I'm going to spectate you.
[54:41.87]Okay, I'll just go die.
[54:45.33]Like I am wound up like a fucking toy at all times.
[54:49.15]So in a game like this, it's just there's no way I can ever play this.
[54:56.61]Let me see this one.
[54:57.49]Like, how bad was this one?
[54:58.53]I don't even know.
[55:01.89]This one?
[55:05.59]I got hit from the right.
[55:06.94]Okay, I played that at the perfect time.
[55:10.16]It was like as if I was playing the game again.
[55:12.88]It was like I was in the game again.
[55:26.37]let's do that again okay I gotta like get I gotta like I gotta like drink a fucking beer or something but that's why we go especially to the like high pop zones because there's no expectation of surviving so there's nothing to be scared let's do it again I'm not gonna scream this time I promise like we you know that there's people there so the surprise the element of surprise is taken out of the game you know that there's people there
[55:47.10]I know.
[55:47.48]Let's do that again.
[55:48.54]This time, I'm like... And the thing was not on full auto.
[55:51.19]I don't even know what gun I picked up.
[55:53.73]I just screamed, and then there was, like, a bunch of people around, and then I shot you.
[55:57.31]Okay, so, like, new tactic.
[55:58.69]If we both get a gun in the, like, high pop areas, then we stick together at all times.
[56:04.29]Yeah.
[56:07.84]You also had a push ready.
[56:09.18]Oh, shit.
[56:09.58]I'm sorry.
[56:12.51]Hit B for full auto.
[56:13.55]Hit B. I'm not going to fucking scream.
[56:16.25]Even if I get scared, I'm going to be like, whoa.
[56:18.60]I'm going to go like, ooh.
[56:20.64]Ooh.
[56:21.06]That was a close one.
[56:22.74]Like, whoa.
[56:24.08]He almost nipped me.
[56:25.16]Yeah.
[56:26.98]Hit B. Alright.
[56:30.24]If you hit B while you have your unarmed, you do punch faster.
[56:34.12]You do like full auto punches.
[56:35.44]You can actually, you know what?
[56:37.16]There actually is a more powerful punch, I think.
[56:39.19]It's if you jump and then punch.
[56:41.57]Okay.
[56:41.69]That's amazing.
[56:44.57]So if you find a frying pan, jump and punch with the frying pan.
[56:48.62]I think you can two-shot somebody.
[56:49.76]Dude, that would be so much fun just to, like, jump and punch someone.
[56:55.61]I have to get somebody with that once.
[57:09.36]How do you prone?
[57:10.40]Oh, wait, I forgot.
[57:11.96]Didn't we talk about, like, you don't want me to talk about how to prone?
[57:14.46]Like, because I look like an idiot?
[57:16.10]Oh, yeah, I did mention that.
[57:18.72]C to crouch!
[57:20.18]Z to prone!
[57:20.92]Yeah, sorry, if you guys, like, if somehow you came to the stream, like, thinking, oh, this is, like, oh, PUBG!
[57:27.20]Somebody else is playing, like, PUBG.
[57:29.08]I'm sorry that this is the shitty stream that you came into of me, like, being terrified of these, like, zombies.
[57:34.63]So, answer me now.
[57:35.89]Do you want to be instantly killed or not?
[57:37.55]Let's do it again, instant.
[57:39.12]Okay, well then we're gonna go to the worst location possible.
[57:43.18]The school.
[57:45.88]We're jumping on it right now.
[57:47.68]No, hold it.
[57:48.86]Three, two, one, go.
[57:55.90]So we're going like down here.
[57:57.52]You're going to die.
[57:58.14]We're gonna die instantly.
[57:59.41]Okay.
[57:59.65]So this is like weird jail over here.
[58:02.39]Like the yellow jail.
[58:04.17]Yeah, the yellow jail.
[58:05.25]The yellow jail for kids.
[58:06.45]Oh, okay.
[58:07.61]It's the school.
[58:12.71]Okay, so we're going to the main building.
[58:14.95]Okay.
[58:15.77]But what we're going to do is stick to this side, and I like to go into the gymnasium.
[58:20.80]Why don't I have any shoes?
[58:21.78]I don't know.
[58:23.68]There's so many people.
[58:25.06]Hold alt and look around you at the air show.
[58:30.95]Look at the Memorial Day air show.
[58:35.31]We are going to instantly die here.
[58:36.85]You're right.
[58:38.41]It's whoever lands first.
[58:39.19]So you see the door that I'm at right now?
[58:40.67]You don't want to land on the roof.
[58:42.25]Okay, I'm not gonna land on the roof.
[58:43.43]Okay, I'm gonna land on the roof.
[58:44.41]You're on the wrong side, but that's okay.
[58:45.94]What happened to my guy?
[58:46.82]Why am I just sitting here like I'm waiting for the carnival to start?
[58:49.38]What the fuck just happened?
[58:50.36]Okay.
[58:52.96]I don't know if that helped or hurt.
[58:54.20]I'm not sure.
[58:54.62]Alright, I gotta fucking... Oh, shit!
[59:06.31]A grenade!
[59:10.21]Okay.
[59:16.17]This guy's like punching me to death.
[59:22.61]No, how do I fight him?
[59:23.41]Can I bite his leg?
[59:23.93]Dude, I...
[59:44.11]Let's do it again.
[59:44.71]I want to do that again.
[59:45.85]Hold on.
[59:47.02]Just let me die.
[59:47.60]Oh, shit.
[59:47.96]You're still alive.
[59:49.98]Let me die real quick.
[59:54.54]I was hoping somebody was going to walk by when that happened and just get fucking blown the hell up.
[60:00.57]That would have been so funny.
[60:03.77]Like, you know, some random guy just walking through tube.
[60:05.95]Ugh.
[60:08.03]I think I like that more than the scary hide for the whole round.
[60:12.31]I think I like this better because if you make it out of this, then you're okay.
[60:16.21]And you've got a few kills.
[60:17.33]If you make it out of this, you have the best loot in the game.
[60:19.68]Yeah.
[60:20.32]Usually.
[60:25.32]So the building that you win in is usually not the best loot.
[60:28.82]Mm-hmm.
[60:29.82]There's fewer people that go there, but that's why.
[60:32.64]Okay, well, I have to get more than one kill on the whole stream.
[60:38.75]Yes, you have to get more than one kill.
[60:40.69]Because, I mean, I'm not going to go an entire live stream with one kill, because that's all I have.
[60:53.92]I should have, like, went for the punch on that guy.
[60:55.64]Okay.
[61:00.47]So you want to do the same thing.
[61:02.57]Same exact thing.
[61:03.17]Right.
[61:03.72]Okay.
[61:06.20]That's fun for me.
[61:07.38]Because it's just carnage.
[61:08.26]It's total chaos.
[61:09.38]No, I agree.
[61:09.80]I think it's a lot of fun.
[61:14.02]There's a lot less stress.
[61:15.61]I made a mistake on my character.
[61:16.75]I don't have the clown hair.
[61:17.93]That was a big mistake.
[61:21.01]I saw that guy.
[61:21.67]Some guy over there has red clown hair.
[61:23.35]And I want it.
[61:28.60]No, but that's a Dr. Ronald.
[61:30.14]Wrong doctor.
[61:36.42]Just got here.
[61:36.86]Did he actually get one kill?
[61:38.06]I did get one kill.
[61:38.98]I did.
[61:41.66]Alright.
[61:42.08]Same place?
[61:44.42]We'll probably go back.
[61:46.26]We're closer to the containers that we were at the time before last.
[61:50.88]Actually, both.
[61:52.10]Which one do you want?
[61:52.84]School or containers?
[61:53.80]Containers.
[61:54.98]Okay.
[61:55.30]Containers, I feel like, was a lot less insane.
[61:58.70]It's gonna be kind of a far jump, but we can make it.
[62:00.92]What is it?
[62:01.26]Is it some kind of car racing?
[62:05.62]It's gonna be a pretty far jump.
[62:08.20]Uh, we'd be better off going to school.
[62:10.16]Alright, that's fine.
[62:15.48]I don't know if we'd make it.
[62:16.16]I hate how it just freezes right here.
[62:17.40]3, 2, 1, go.
[62:19.26]That's really annoying.
[62:19.98]Every time you start to say 3, 2, 1, my game freezes for like 3 seconds.
[62:24.53]That's just a result of a hundred people being in the same server in the same plane.
[62:28.33]Okay.
[62:29.51]So here we go.
[62:30.79]Straight down.
[62:32.13]No, not straight down.
[62:33.09]You want to like nose towards the school.
[62:34.83]Okay.
[62:36.20]Until you get a decent distance away.
[62:38.42]Like right now I'm turning directly downward.
[62:41.20]Okay.
[62:42.16]So we're going to the main building facing us front left.
[62:47.58]Main building facing us front left.
[62:50.10]Like right here, this left corner, right at the front.
[62:52.92]Okay.
[62:55.41]Don't land on the roof, Etalyx, like you told me.
[62:57.67]If you're feeling really dastardly, land on the roof.
[63:02.67]But that's the only way you can die fast.
[63:03.89]Alright, here I am.
[63:04.43]Okay, bad luck so far.
[63:11.19]Can you pick up a weight?
[63:11.95]No.
[63:14.61]Really bad luck.
[63:16.19]There's something on the ground there for you.
[63:17.93]Good luck.
[63:18.78]It's some kind of rifle.
[63:21.08]I mean, it's a revolver.
[63:26.29]Okay.
[63:26.75]I got a gun.
[63:34.01]Check the rooms.
[63:34.49]There's a shotgun in here.
[63:35.35]Gun.
[63:39.02]Guy on the stairs, I think.
[63:40.58]Right above us.
[63:41.10]I don't have... I can't... Whatever.
[63:52.02]Don't use the revolver.
[63:52.92]Switch to your shotgun.
[63:54.04]What?
[63:55.22]Switch to the shotgun.
[63:57.56]I think I'm better with the revolver.
[63:59.10]No, the revolver is the worst.
[64:00.70]That's the worst one.
[64:04.42]I think I might be better with the revolver.
[64:05.74]Okay, guys up here.
[64:08.52]Two guys, I think.
[64:09.18]Two guys.
[64:10.57]Or there's two guys here, but there's one guy up here.
[64:15.83]He's in one of these rooms.
[64:21.09]He's not in that one.
[64:25.17]Unless he's on the roof?
[64:26.13]Is he still on the roof?
[64:26.99]I don't know.
[64:29.21]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[64:34.45]He got hurt.
[64:38.11]Shit.
[64:40.53]I don't know why I thought that was like you.
[64:46.80]Fucking God damn it.
[64:49.86]Shoot first, ask questions later.
[64:51.92]Like, I saw a guy, a guy, like, fucking popped over from the right side, and I was like, oh, that's a, no, it's not.
[64:57.52]Did you use a revolver the whole time?
[64:59.07]No.
[64:59.71]What am I, you want me to shoot a shotgun down the fucking hallway?
[65:03.72]No, I wanted you to, like, use a shotgun, hide in the room, make them come to you, and then shoot them when they come.
[65:07.86]Well, like, the guy was shooting at me.
[65:09.92]I turned around and shot him once with a shotgun.
[65:11.34]Then I saw you, which wasn't you, pulled out the revolver and didn't hit anybody.
[65:18.05]That's okay.
[65:18.49]It's okay.
[65:19.15]It's okay.
[65:19.61]We'll get it.
[65:20.09]We'll get it, chat.
[65:21.11]We're gonna get him a kill.
[65:22.87]Next time, I'll just give him the good gun and tell him to spray.
[65:26.99]Until someone dies.
[65:28.01]Go play Sabor.
[65:35.25]Not in the top 50.
[65:36.41]We were top six last time.
[65:38.93]Yeah, we're taking a break from the top six, okay?
[65:42.49]We're doing training.
[65:43.27]This is gun training right now.
[65:44.37]This is too high stress.
[65:45.07]I just want to, like, go... Can I just change to, like, playing skee-ball?
[65:49.95]I'm going to go to, like... Skee-ball with bullets.
[65:51.61]I'm going to go to, like, www.fucking-ski-ball-free.org or whatever the fuck I can go to.
[65:56.19]And just, like, relax and play skee-ball.
[66:05.25]Sorry, I couldn't ready up yet.
[66:06.97]Oh, well, there you go.
[66:17.16]Okay, so school's bad luck, apparently.
[66:18.90]We're not going to go to school.
[66:20.46]Too claustrophobic.
[66:21.81]Too many doors.
[66:23.29]Is the real problem the fact that we've been getting just, like, shotguns and revolvers?
[66:27.01]And, like, other people are getting assault rifles?
[66:28.47]No, I had an assault rifle that game.
[66:30.57]Oh.
[66:31.43]But I wasn't playing smart because you had already died.
[66:34.87]I feel like I got shot by an assault rifle.
[66:38.01]You probably did.
[66:38.75]The reason people landed the school is because it has really good gear.
[66:42.81]So they probably did have an assault rifle.
[66:45.22]Alright.
[66:46.68]But if we want to be, like, top six and we land in the places where no one is, we end up with shotguns and Uzis and, like, level one backpacks.
[66:55.44]So...
[66:57.20]So yeah, so streaming my literal first experience with any of these kind of genre games is a bad idea.
[67:03.99]That is, that is what I said, yeah.
[67:07.05]I don't get it, I'm actually, no, it's fun.
[67:08.77]Stream's my fault, Chad.
[67:10.35]No, this, this, I'm having fun.
[67:12.35]Hold on, is that, like, is there, hold on, what the fuck was that link that somebody just put in?
[67:23.30]It's Carnival.
[67:26.60]I played H1Z1.
[67:27.74]I barely played H1.
[67:29.23]Guys, my H1Z1 was like running around punching people and like throwing rocks.
[67:38.27]I didn't play H1Z1 to play H1Z1.
[67:39.71]Do you want to die fast or no?
[67:41.99]Yeah.
[67:42.13]Answer me now.
[67:42.93]This time I'm going to shut the fuck up and we're going to try to win.
[67:46.11]So, but you want to go to the hot zone?
[67:48.03]Hot zone.
[67:49.23]Okay.
[67:50.87]I'm letting you pick your poison.
[67:52.25]Me and Star walked around, like, yelling at people about berry bushes.
[67:54.95]Like, you guys seriously think that, like, I played H1Z1?
[67:57.33]Hey, somebody said, please play Rust.
[68:07.66]Okay, three, two, one, jump.
[68:11.02]Now, this time I'm getting an assault rifle, and I'm going to get, like, seven kills.
[68:15.00]Alright, we're heading to the pit.
[68:20.04]I'm assuming the pit is that pit, right?
[68:22.44]Yeah, it's literally the pit.
[68:23.88]It's literally the pit.
[68:24.48]You're a little far down.
[68:25.28]You're a little too... Angle your nose up.
[68:27.86]Follow your nose.
[68:29.76]Look towards the thing, because you're going to have to run.
[68:31.83]I'm good.
[68:43.11]Well, there's about three other squads here.
[68:44.94]Okay.
[68:47.54]Half of them will probably go for the building.
[68:49.44]mm-hmm I'm just gonna drop me right now we're gonna go for what we're going I'm going for warehouses yeah I'm going for the one of these broken down warehouses like right like over my landing was really bad my landing I don't know how bad my learning it's probably bad but why did I slow down so much there's a guy in that warehouse that is he's in this warehouse yep fuck don't yeah don't go in that warehouse
[69:18.82]Not in that warehouse do not go in that warehouse Come rescue that one I'm gonna accept my fate no no no no you're fine Okay, I thought you told me one punch like that to kill somebody no I said if you have a melee weapon and you jump fuck I thought you meant like one giant punch the face Punch man, no, you're not a whopper in while putting it.
[69:46.93]Oh
[69:48.70]It's okay, though.
[69:49.28]We only got 60 seconds till we're back in the game.
[69:51.24]Alright, we'll do this one.
[69:55.56]This one's for real.
[69:56.88]I said that last time, but this one actually is for real.
[70:09.21]You can actually two-hit punch?
[70:10.89]Really?
[70:21.77]Alright, let's play the game for real.
[70:24.57]No hot zone.
[70:25.59]I've proven I can't handle it.
[70:26.75]Hey, the hot zone's fine as long as you go for guns and don't mess up your landing, which is what I did.
[70:32.13]Oh, wait, you messed up your landing.
[70:33.67]Yeah, I did.
[70:36.49]But you would have died.
[70:37.77]I'm glad I did because if I had actually gotten the gun, I would have felt even more disappointed.
[70:44.71]Melee hit detection is bad.
[70:46.60]Yes, it's terrible.
[70:53.21]I'm going to do that too.
[70:53.73]It looks like fun.
[71:01.89]As long as you don't intentionally go in warehouses where people already are.
[71:04.87]Well, I thought when I told you I was going to go in the Broken Town warehouse, you were like, okay.
[71:09.53]And then you said, not that warehouse.
[71:11.15]I said, there's a guy in the warehouse that you're next to.
[71:13.56]Yeah, well, isn't it just who gets the gun wins?
[71:16.04]Yeah, but he went in before you.
[71:19.54]Okay, we're going to go to the other set of containers.
[71:22.34]Okay.
[71:23.43]and die there instead.
[71:24.33]I really want to go to school, but we've had such a bad experience there.
[71:29.64]This is the last time we're going hot zone, and then we're going to do real zone.
[71:35.15]Alright.
[71:35.55]We're going way west.
[71:36.59]Three, two, one.
[71:38.35]Go.
[71:40.63]My game froze too.
[71:43.52]Way west?
[71:44.50]Way west.
[71:45.06]So what you want to do is look to the sky with your mouse when you're aiming the direction you want to go.
[71:50.21]Right.
[71:51.01]And while you're looking to the sky, alt look down.
[71:53.15]Okay.
[71:56.75]So you should be looking up as high as you can and then using alt to look around without adjusting.
[72:04.43]But you do want to turn.
[72:05.81]We'll just land at the stuff underneath us.
[72:09.21]You're already way down there.
[72:11.19]I had a dream where this happened.
[72:13.26]This is a dream I had.
[72:14.24]I'm looking at a dream.
[72:15.14]Forget the warehouses.
[72:16.00]Just go straight down.
[72:19.28]Here, I'll mark it on the map.
[72:21.18]Do not go to the warehouse.
[72:23.06]What about this little spot right here?
[72:25.26]You should be able to see it on your mini-map.
[72:28.78]Oh, okay.
[72:32.17]I'm going to be a little far away.
[72:33.67]That's okay.
[72:34.29]If you see a house underneath you, then just go ahead.
[72:38.53]And we'll meet up because probably you're not going to find anybody.
[72:41.74]Okay.
[72:47.82]Hey, there you are.
[72:57.47]And then I will come to you.
[73:00.98]I spent more time in match preparation zone.
[73:02.70]Well, we spent like a good 30 plus minutes in the second game we played.
[73:06.76]We got to the sixth place.
[73:08.06]Second game was a big game.
[73:12.44]Are you running to me?
[73:13.34]Yeah, I'm right there.
[73:15.08]The last like three or four rounds was just like go to the hot zones and die.
[73:20.11]Keep following me.
[73:21.21]Nothing in those houses?
[73:23.15]Absolutely nothing.
[73:24.99]What a game that should be not praised.
[73:30.71]Am I going to TwitchCon?
[73:31.74]Yes, I am going to go to TwitchCon this year.
[73:47.09]Dispraisement.
[73:49.74]Disappraisement.
[73:51.06]So the bad news is somebody landed here and they have guns.
[73:54.83]So don't run that way.
[73:56.15]So that's the only bad news you have.
[73:58.33]Okay.
[73:59.39]So where are we going?
[73:59.95]Are we going to go be like mountain men for a little while?
[74:03.87]Yeah.
[74:05.43]Basically, okay.
[74:06.31]Nope, not going to go there.
[74:07.20]Not going to go there.
[74:09.00]I'm going to keep it to myself.
[74:12.50]This is fine.
[74:14.21]Etalyx is about to get really angry.
[74:15.89]He's about to go like, well, if you weren't such a fucking idiot.
[74:23.34]Okay, we're not dead yet.
[74:25.34]We're going to be fine.
[74:27.22]We might be soon.
[74:28.08]You think somebody can shoot that far from over there and actually hit somebody?
[74:32.08]Just the place that we're going is the next place they're going to go.
[74:35.56]Well, they're not going to see us.
[74:37.77]Already at 83.
[74:40.27]Already doing pretty well.
[74:44.36]Okay, we're almost there.
[74:45.64]Mm-hmm.
[74:48.65]Marked it on the map.
[74:50.47]Nobody's got a gun.
[74:51.89]Got a level one backpack.
[74:54.27]Yeah, we're fine.
[74:55.91]Everything is going according to plan.
[75:01.26]As long as nobody's already here.
[75:05.72]Do you sense any movement?
[75:12.15]I think it's unlooted so far.
[75:14.91]Okay, you pick a small house and I'll pick a... You pick whichever house you want.
[75:18.42]I'll go to the other one.
[75:18.98]I'm just going to the right.
[75:21.16]Good luck.
[75:21.88]Don't get snuck up on.
[75:22.66]If you hear footsteps, it's not me.
[75:25.90]I love that.
[75:26.82]If you hear something, it's not me.
[75:28.50]Can I close the door?
[75:32.91]Combat pants.
[75:35.63]Where's the shotgun?
[75:40.27]No, I already have that.
[75:40.93]There's nothing in here.
[75:52.06]There's an extra pistol in here.
[75:55.42]But I would not come to my house just for a pistol.
[75:59.82]Ooh, this is good.
[76:01.76]I got a bunch of first aid and I have a rifle.
[76:19.15]Nothing else in here.
[76:21.57]I don't think so.
[76:24.45]Well, there are a couple of doors that I haven't opened.
[76:27.29]Bathtub.
[76:29.83]I don't have an SMG.
[76:30.84]Wait, what's a backpack?
[76:36.98]There's backpacks pretty much everywhere.
[76:38.38]So if you don't find one in the first house, then keep looking.
[76:46.56]I've already checked the two-story house that was across from yours.
[76:48.94]Okay.
[76:52.28]And I'm in the other two-story house right now.
[76:55.64]I'm so scared to fucking walk around right now.
[76:58.16]I hate this.
[76:59.24]You can walk as long as you can hear other people walking.
[77:02.19]So if you hear footsteps that you don't think are yours.
[77:06.97]Coming to you.
[77:08.49]First aid.
[77:08.95]Wait, wait, wait.
[77:09.61]Am I missing things?
[77:10.43]I apparently missed something in there.
[77:12.37]Alright.
[77:12.63]Hey, there's first aid in there for you.
[77:16.22]In that other house.
[77:20.68]Okay, I think I've got pretty much everything from this house.
[77:23.72]Uh, did you get both of the other two?
[77:25.36]No, this first aid in the house.
[77:27.23]Did you get the small one?
[77:29.23]Uh, what?
[77:30.87]Have you looted this house right here?
[77:32.55]No, this first aid in this house.
[77:38.32]Hey, look!
[77:39.30]A SCAR-L!
[77:42.01]Just kidding, not this house, the other house.
[77:43.25]There's an S12K here.
[77:49.68]That is a shotgun.
[77:53.80]It is a semi-automatic shotgun.
[77:55.30]Do you want it?
[77:55.68]You can take it.
[77:56.70]You can take it.
[78:02.10]Okay.
[78:04.10]Car?
[78:04.45]So, that car does not work.
[78:08.09]What?
[78:09.88]It is broken down.
[78:10.84]What you need to do is grab some body armor.
[78:14.75]I think there's one in this house.
[78:21.71]And then we will be good to go.
[78:23.29]I don't remember what room it's in.
[78:28.05]Work boots?
[78:28.53]Alright, I finally got shoes on.
[78:32.37]Body armor?
[78:33.23]Somewhere?
[78:34.33]I thought it was in this house.
[78:37.21]Here it is.
[78:41.65]it's in this bottom room yeah getting stuck did you just open a door I did yeah that's me alright so when I'm around your character I hear bullet shell casings dropping yeah why is that uh they're leaking out of your revolver can you see that
[79:07.21]They're being shot out of the revolver on your hip.
[79:09.71]Yeah, that's weird.
[79:10.94]What the fuck?
[79:12.26]No, it's being reloaded.
[79:13.98]Oh, it's being automatically ghost reloaded.
[79:16.38]There's a ghost reloading that over and over again, just playing around.
[79:20.48]The phantom revolver.
[79:22.08]Nice.
[79:22.34]Maybe that'll scare people.
[79:25.16]You've got like a jingle bell.
[79:27.58]People are going to hear me.
[79:29.04]Yeah, they're going to hear you coming, but that's the sign of their impending death.
[79:32.43]Oh, God.
[79:33.61]When they hear the jingle.
[79:35.15]That's like your Jason Voorhees.
[79:39.49]And you tell me that vehicle doesn't work.
[79:41.81]It does not work.
[79:42.45]Alright, remember, this vehicle does.
[79:47.89]Somebody may have been occupying that vehicle, Alex.
[79:50.21]No.
[79:50.57]This looks like a spawn.
[79:51.91]This one looks safe.
[79:53.41]Okay.
[79:53.81]If they're on the side of the road, you're usually good.
[79:57.29]There are a couple of, like, spawns near houses, but most of the time, it means somebody's there.
[80:02.45]Okay.
[80:07.42]Okay, so...
[80:09.97]Hope you enjoy your chauffeur.
[80:12.43]I like it with the same character.
[80:13.21]Do you have a radio station that you prefer?
[80:14.97]Yeah.
[80:16.74]W. B. B. B. Oops.
[80:26.52]Oops.
[80:26.98]That did not put up very much resistance.
[80:33.69]So do you want to like go loot stuff?
[80:37.01]Do you want to go find people?
[80:39.39]I think we should probably loot a little bit more of it.
[80:43.65]So we're going to stay out of that area.
[80:44.87]Yeah.
[80:46.87]What was that?
[80:50.08]Are the doors open here?
[80:56.30]I don't think so.
[81:00.08]Yep, it is.
[81:01.04]That door is open.
[81:01.82]Okay.
[81:04.70]So, they've probably been looted already, and they moved on to the bigger village.
[81:08.26]Maybe.
[81:08.56]That is very true.
[81:11.93]Possible.
[81:13.39]Do you need a red dot?
[81:15.17]I have a really, really great scope right now, so no.
[81:19.35]Okay.
[81:20.67]Thank you for your concern.
[81:30.20]Wait, what?
[81:34.75]Smoke grenade.
[81:36.71]A sickle.
[81:38.61]A sickle.
[81:39.35]Oh, that's awesome.
[81:41.79]Please don't get killed trying to sickle someone.
[81:43.73]I'm not going to.
[81:45.25]I promise I'm not going to be an idiot.
[81:49.41]Alright, there's a lot of noise over here.
[82:00.66]Okay, you ready to go?
[82:01.26]Oh my god, you scared me.
[82:03.84]Let's go.
[82:04.72]Ready to go die somewhere else?
[82:07.44]I'm ready to fucking red-dock somebody.
[82:14.61]It's a noisy car.
[82:16.83]Yeah, it is making a lot of noise.
[82:17.79]I feel like I got a, like a, playing car on the back of my bicycle.
[82:28.66]52 alive, and we haven't seen a soul.
[82:30.88]Oh.
[82:31.34]How is that possible?
[82:32.08]How have we not, like, seen anything?
[82:34.07]It's the difference in intentionally landing somewhere where nobody else lands.
[82:37.87]Okay.
[82:39.91]A.K.A.
[82:41.27]Place kind of sucks.
[82:43.63]Hold on.
[82:43.87]Be careful over here.
[82:44.61]We might get crept up on.
[82:48.61]Sickle.
[82:52.49]Okay, so here's what I'm going to do.
[82:56.05]What are you going to do?
[82:56.85]We're just going to kind of wait for another 15, 20 seconds or so in the car.
[83:01.65]Mm-hmm.
[83:02.63]And then the circle's going to close.
[83:04.95]And then we're going to move to the new circle.
[83:07.19]And then we're going to get out.
[83:08.95]And we're going to fight people.
[83:10.50]You got it.
[83:10.90]Okay.
[83:11.90]I'm ready.
[83:13.36]I got my green sickle.
[83:14.88]I'm good.
[83:15.14]Okay, we got to move in right now.
[83:24.42]Don't mind me.
[83:24.94]Just catch a little air.
[83:27.52]But that's not all I can do.
[83:30.04]Oh!
[83:32.10]Wow, that was fun.
[83:34.54]Wow, what a fun game.
[83:35.94]Wow, how fun.
[83:38.20]You just did a thing that I recognize as fun.
[83:41.66]Hold on.
[83:42.32]You think that's all I can do?
[83:43.40]What else can you do?
[83:45.91]Show me something really awesome.
[83:47.21]Show me like a giant jump.
[83:52.13]That wasn't a giant jump, Daleks.
[83:54.39]That was pretty lame.
[83:55.11]You think that's all I can do?
[83:57.70]Totally lame-o.
[83:58.78]Looking for some sweet jumps.
[84:00.98]Oh, gosh.
[84:03.96]I love how the car... Nothing's wrong.
[84:05.85]Nothing's wrong.
[84:06.57]We just went like... Hold on.
[84:09.55]This is the spot.
[84:14.37]I gotta get some speed first.
[84:15.95]Should we check the port-a-potty?
[84:18.90]No.
[84:20.40]What's mounted up there?
[84:21.06]There's like a fucking machine gun mounted on there.
[84:24.20]What are you talking about?
[84:25.04]There's a machine gun mounted on the port-a-potty.
[84:28.60]Hold on.
[84:33.42]Hold on.
[84:34.16]Wait.
[84:35.92]I gotta find the stupid rice paddy fields.
[84:42.51]We'll get there eventually.
[84:46.25]You haven't seen my thing yet.
[84:47.47]You haven't seen it.
[84:48.39]What about that?
[84:48.87]What is on this porta potty?
[84:53.05]Can't tell.
[84:53.53]Where's the one with the little bumps?
[84:56.12]Oh, we're gonna run like right into like a bunch of people here.
[85:01.55]That car spawn?
[85:02.31]Is there people in here?
[85:04.39]There could be people in here.
[85:05.35]We're just like flying around.
[85:13.43]Yeah.
[85:13.79]Well, don't you want to do like sick tricks?
[85:15.63]Kinda.
[85:16.91]Okay, well, find me a good jump.
[85:18.34]Wait, can we get in the log thing?
[85:19.74]Can we get in the... No.
[85:21.66]Wait, can we get in that thing?

[85:52.36]Is that what you're telling me?
[85:53.20]Or do you want to do a flip?
[85:54.68]I mean, I don't think I want to do a flip because it's going to kill us.
[85:59.29]Are you sure you don't want to do a flip?
[86:00.81]Is that a guy right there?
[86:02.61]No, it's a rock.
[86:06.45]Okay, this feels like an old Tiger handheld game.
[86:10.23]We're not moving, just the space around us is.
[86:12.47]It's like we're in front of a green screen.
[86:15.79]Well, let's try to find some stuff.
[86:24.14]AKM on the ground?
[86:27.14]Ballistic mask?
[86:29.22]I don't think it does anything, actually.
[86:30.78]What's better, the AKM or the 12-gauge?
[86:35.44]Depends on if you want to have something to go, like, really close quarters or not.
[86:38.42]Nah, I'll stay with the shotgun.
[86:42.86]Police vest.
[86:49.24]Can I have the ammo, then?
[86:51.16]Actually, never mind.
[86:52.16]Never mind.
[86:52.51]You need ammo?
[86:52.99]Machete?
[86:53.81]Yeah.
[87:00.39]still doing that like that noise alright so we gotta be careful in this area so you want to talk about the scary part this we're in the scary part right now yeah we are people are going to be going to these houses anytime now what about the machine gun mounted on that roof what are you smoking is this like I don't understand I don't get the joke what's the joke I don't get it
[87:30.42]You don't have to get it, it's okay.
[87:31.69]Okay.
[87:35.67]It's not much to get.
[87:36.63]Yeah, question marks.
[87:40.01]I just got question marks.
[87:42.52]Do you have an SMG?
[87:44.26]I do.
[87:44.82]Here, take that.
[87:45.88]Is it a silencer?
[87:48.10]It's like something cool.
[87:51.24]Where?
[87:51.50]I'll just put it on the ground.
[87:56.63]Did I?
[87:56.93]Yeah.
[87:59.55]You're very welcome.
[88:00.43]Neat.
[88:06.24]I need to just sit here and just wait for movement.
[88:09.18]Nah.
[88:11.22]You don't have to.
[88:11.84]You just have to make sure if you get under fire and you don't know where they're shooting from that you do not pop back out.
[88:20.26]We're going to know where we need to go in about 10 seconds.
[88:22.86]You want to go in the weird house?
[88:24.16]I would not sit in the doorway that you're sitting in.
[88:26.32]I kind of want to go in the weird documentary house from TNT.
[88:29.88]Lead the way.
[88:31.24]This one.
[88:31.60]Like weird houses.
[88:35.32]As you can see, they decided to have the top roof bigger than the bottom roof.
[88:39.82]And that was because he's an architect and he wanted to be a really hippy-dippy piece of shit.
[88:45.76]Very interesting architecture.
[88:47.32]Interesting house.
[88:55.55]Okay.
[88:55.93]Now we know where we need to go.
[88:58.43]Ah, my wonderful, wonderful neighborhood.
[89:00.49]And it's pretty far away.
[89:04.95]Welcome back to TNT Strange House.
[89:09.94]We check out the weirdest houses.
[89:12.28]Look at that one.
[89:15.70]Do you want a scar by chance?
[89:17.26]No, I'm good.
[89:18.66]Do you want a UMP?
[89:23.27]Why am I not driving the motorcycle?
[89:27.43]There you go.
[89:30.35]No, I'm good with weapons.
[89:34.75]Alright.
[89:38.73]Lead us on to victory.
[89:42.37]Which way?
[89:42.69]This way?
[89:43.91]Northeast.
[89:49.05]Is it every part of that fence?
[89:51.39]Uh-huh.
[89:57.71]Yeah, we're going to die here and just... Oh, go kart.
[90:00.77]It's okay.
[90:01.69]Motorcycle's more fun.
[90:02.50]Motorcycle's more fun.
[90:04.78]Your tire's not on the ground.
[90:06.00]I don't think I want to.
[90:08.42]Do I want to go faster?
[90:12.08]They're at the church to the right.
[90:16.47]You want to go there?
[90:18.29]You can keep going into... I mean, we're like really rolling up here.
[90:21.37]There's probably people in here.
[90:24.17]Let's park our car.
[90:26.69]Down here.
[90:28.07]Okay.
[90:36.81]Never sit still, just FYI.
[90:38.09]Okay.
[90:39.01]Unless you're about to shoot.
[90:45.19]No sign of any movement.
[90:48.25]Why is everybody saying car?
[90:50.53]Car, car, car.
[90:51.73]What are you talking about?
[90:52.29]Car.
[90:54.25]I got to stop looking at chat right now.
[90:55.33]This is dangerous.
[90:56.35]Yeah, this is a bad time.
[91:01.87]You're in this house, right?
[91:03.45]I am, yeah.
[91:04.29]It's not a good house.
[91:05.01]This place kind of sucks.
[91:06.75]There's a motorcycle coming up on us from the north.
[91:10.90]East now.
[91:11.32]Okay.
[91:13.38]They probably just stopped to get out.
[91:19.50]Be careful in the doorway.
[91:22.02]Another car coming up the other side of us from the west.
[91:25.08]We're pinned in between potentially two vehicles.
[91:28.66]Okay.
[91:31.76]He just got out.
[91:32.36]Don't make a move.
[91:34.25]On your side?
[91:35.53]Just don't move.
[91:36.53]Don't move?
[91:38.53]Unless you see someone.
[91:41.03]You're visible through the door.
[91:42.03]What do you mean?
[91:43.33]If he came in the door I'm looking at, he's going to see you.
[91:45.95]This is like a puzzle game.
[91:47.90]Don't stand next to me.
[91:50.30]Dude, I'm like making all kinds of noise.
[91:51.58]I got like jingle bells playing in the background.
[91:53.46]Alright, we probably need to go to a different house.
[91:59.22]Here's what we're gonna do.
[92:00.92]I'm gonna be the bait.
[92:02.00]I'm gonna sprint from this house to the other house.
[92:03.40]No, no, no.
[92:03.58]That's too scary for me.
[92:04.86]Ready?
[92:05.88]I'm gonna sprint from this house to the other house.
[92:07.36]Okay, three, two, one, go.
[92:07.98]The doors are open.
[92:17.36]Okay, I'm gonna go clear the second floor.
[92:24.66]Why am I so specific?
[92:27.50]They're outside.
[92:29.60]Where?
[92:30.70]They're coming in the house.
[92:31.60]They're coming in this house?
[92:32.26]Just stay up here.
[92:33.13]Take cover.
[92:33.63]You're sitting in a corner.
[92:34.57]So you want to get somewhere where there's a wall?
[92:37.21]You can have my wall if you want.
[92:38.57]That's fine.
[92:39.99]You can just... They're coming up the stairs.
[92:41.65]They're coming up the stairs.
[92:42.65]Why are you hiding us in the bathroom?
[92:44.19]You're backing... Oh, my goodness.
[92:45.61]I'm just scared to do this.
[92:47.21]We are going to die here.
[92:49.51]It's going to happen any second now.
[92:55.33]They're just gonna open the door from third person.
[92:57.01]Shh.
[93:00.02]GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!
[93:22.17]I left.
[93:24.10]Uh-huh.
[93:24.40]I was dead.
[93:24.90]There's no reason not to leave.
[93:32.79]Did I hit a single shot?
[93:33.67]I don't know.
[93:34.09]Probably not.
[93:34.83]That was a terrible place to be, and I backed us in.
[93:42.05]Let's do it again.
[93:45.26]You know what?
[93:45.56]I'm going to blame that on the fact that I was constantly making noise the entire time, so it was over.
[93:54.05]My character was just a fucking Christmas tree of lights.
[93:56.79]It was like, hey, come over here and see us.
[94:01.87]So in that situation in the future, if we were playing for serious, what you would want to do is sit in a spot where you can see them come up the stairs and just shoot them when they come up the stairs.
[94:14.49]So how come you went in the bathroom?
[94:16.19]I was trying... I was backing up to where I had the bathroom as cover.
[94:20.87]Like, I was using that corner to see third person.
[94:24.53]It looked like I was in the bathroom, but I was using the third person cam to watch the stairs.
[94:31.75]But it's all good.
[94:33.27]Guys, this is not a game that I play.
[94:35.43]Alright?
[94:35.77]I'm just having fun.
[94:37.17]I'm just having fun.
[94:38.29]It's okay.
[94:40.90]You don't have to... Who cares?
[94:49.42]I had jingle bells playing since we started.
[94:51.63]Etalyx is mad.
[95:01.49]No, I knew what I was getting myself into.
[95:05.06]I did it with full knowledge.
[95:08.94]I was ready.
[95:09.40]Alright, well maybe this time I won't be constantly blowing a horn.
[95:19.55]ruining my gamer score alright we're going to Georgia pole on the west okay and we're going to land at those containers again you got it in three two one go so I want you to face the containers yes then without holding alt look up as high as you can I I'm doing that right now then once you've done that hold off and look down okay
[95:45.45]because it's really, really far away.
[95:47.87]I mean, like, did I do that?
[95:50.21]You seem like you're going the wrong way.
[95:52.30]How am I going?
[95:54.08]You might not be, but it seems like you are.
[95:56.94]This game's a little too try-hard for me.
[95:58.66]I'm not going to lie.
[96:03.74]That's why we're going to the fun zone.
[96:05.50]Wow, they got really far over there.
[96:09.00]Alright, do you see these houses that I'm going to mark them?
[96:17.15]I'm gonna say sure yes yeah okay hey mountain man uh don't worry I'll try to kill this guy and then you can come join okay good cool I'm okay can you get like stuck in a tree that's not gonna happen is it uh you might get stuck in a tree I don't know okay I'm alright I just dropped like 75 feet I'm fine
[96:44.76]Alright, I'm not going to make any jokes this time.
[96:46.60]I'm not going to be like, I'm going to get actual kills.
[96:49.78]I'm going to show you guys why they used to call me the fucking bastard.
[96:56.81]One down.
[96:57.81]Nice.
[96:59.57]Is there another guy there?
[97:02.51]I don't know.
[97:02.89]Probably.
[97:03.27]Okay, hopefully there's not somebody in this house.
[97:12.39]Okay, I see a ski pole.
[97:22.07]I'm in the house with you.
[97:23.34]I got a ski pole.
[97:23.98]I'm good.
[97:26.42]Okay.
[97:33.08]There's a micro Uzi for you.
[97:34.50]Micro Uzi.
[97:36.52]We got ammo.
[97:37.20]We got pants in here.
[97:39.06]Grenade.
[97:40.80]Nice.
[97:43.54]Roof?
[97:45.12]I got one grenade.
[97:47.22]Stun grenade?
[97:55.57]Machete?
[97:55.83]I want the black pants.
[97:58.51]No, shit.
[97:59.23]That's messing up my cosplay.
[98:01.17]Fucking painter.
[98:02.47]There we go.
[98:06.58]Anybody over here?
[98:08.58]I don't know.
[98:09.40]You tell me.
[98:10.88]Go look for him.
[98:12.56]What do you mean, go look for him?
[98:13.44]Does that mean there's a guy here?
[98:16.12]He has a friend somewhere.
[98:17.06]I don't know where he is.
[98:17.88]Okay, we'll be careful.
[98:23.77]Let's go find him.
[98:24.41]Is that going to drop, like, right here?
[98:32.19]And that's a car?
[98:32.95]Alrighty.
[98:34.31]We are in business.
[98:35.15]You want to, like...
[98:38.50]Go to the actual hot zone?
[98:39.94]Yeah, let's go to the hot zone.
[98:41.78]So I can jump crowbar somebody in the face.
[98:44.36]That thing is going to land so far away.
[98:48.56]Do you see the parachuting?
[98:50.32]I do.
[98:53.44]For one second, I thought that was... I don't know why.
[98:55.94]I thought that was a guy that was just taking his time.
[98:59.80]You wanna go, you wanna see guys?
[99:01.42]The guys are in here.
[99:02.48]Oh dear.
[99:02.78]He's on top of that canister.
[99:03.80]Do you see if you're right?
[99:04.52]Yeah, I see him.
[99:05.20]I see him right now.
[99:06.32]I see him.
[99:07.74]Just stop the car.
[99:09.22]Stop the car.
[99:14.41]There's another guy here, so... What do you have?
[99:18.47]An Uzi.
[99:19.13]This guy's AFK.
[99:20.07]He's just dead.
[99:20.55]Why is he AFK?
[99:21.37]I don't know, but give me the free kill.
[99:25.30]Got it.
[99:25.88]Didn't get a kill on stream?
[99:26.74]Yeah, I did.
[99:28.12]Fuck you.
[99:29.20]I got a kill on stream.
[99:30.74]Okay, go get his stuff, I guess.
[99:34.89]Get his stuff.
[99:36.55]Yeah, find the awkward place you're supposed to jump up.
[99:38.63]He probably landed there.
[99:44.79]I don't like this.
[99:45.57]Awkward jumping time.
[99:46.93]Oh, hold on.
[99:48.67]Nope, stay in the painter.
[99:53.55]Helmet?
[99:54.32]Yeah.
[99:54.66]Yeah.
[99:56.41]Wait, are you looting him from down there?
[99:58.09]No, there was a helmet in here.
[99:59.49]Oh.
[100:03.11]Did we save the stream?
[100:04.97]Got a kill?
[100:05.45]Alright, I'm going up in the watchtower here.
[100:10.03]And... Okay, I thought you were a bad guy.
[100:12.57]Can I get the troop from here?
[100:14.54]I don't know, maybe.
[100:15.12]I don't think so.
[100:18.28]Kind of had not good stuff.
[100:23.68]I'm the safety painter.
[100:26.77]Yeah, the safety painter.
[100:28.17]Gas can, just in case.
[100:29.21]No, fuck that.
[100:30.29]I don't want that.
[100:32.08]Why would I want a gas can?
[100:40.54]I'm just going to take him.
[100:42.66]Might as well.
[100:45.23]I'm going to wrap around to the right side.
[100:47.83]Okay.
[100:48.89]There was another guy here, right?
[100:50.77]I mean, I would think so.
[100:52.23]Did you down him or insta-kill him?
[100:53.77]He died.
[100:54.99]Then that means his friend is dead.
[100:59.52]How very sad.
[101:00.86]No, that is sad.
[101:05.40]Hang on, there is a... Is there a guy?
[101:07.74]Chest piece.
[101:09.66]There's a backpack right there.
[101:10.54]No, armor.
[101:12.80]Oh, there's armor here?
[101:14.93]Big armor.
[101:15.59]Big protective armor that you need to stay alive.
[101:18.37]Oh, sick.
[101:18.83]Armor?
[101:21.99]Basically the same game.
[101:24.64]Thanks for the armor, dude.
[101:26.38]I just put an eight-time scope on my shotgun.
[101:28.24]Eight-time scope.
[101:28.72]I feel pretty good about that.
[101:29.42]Nice, dude.
[101:29.74]That's fucking awesome.
[101:31.68]Hey, did you get that backpack over there?
[101:34.46]Oh, nice, dude.
[101:35.25]A shotgun.
[101:35.61]I'll take that one.
[101:37.37]Is that, like, mom from New York, father from Boston?
[101:41.21]Hey, yo, we got a car over here.
[101:42.15]Come over here, dude.
[101:46.39]And you really just weren't sure whose accent to imitate, so you said both.
[101:50.62]This is probably their car.
[101:52.72]We'll take it with us.
[101:53.28]No, it's our car.
[101:53.66]We parked here.
[102:06.28]You're right.
[102:07.60]We did do that.
[102:08.28]Of course I remember.
[102:10.94]Hey, keep fucking honking.
[102:12.30]I'm reloading.
[102:16.70]See anybody?
[102:20.39]Anybody?
[102:21.99]Can I drive through the fence?
[102:22.85]Does that work?
[102:23.95]You can, yeah.
[102:24.71]It's just what's on the other side of the fence that's the problem.
[102:27.67]Oh, it's just this.
[102:28.51]It's fine.
[102:32.80]Okay.
[102:33.56]You want to go to the left over here?
[102:35.26]We need to go this way, right?
[102:38.47]Yeah, we need to step one, get on the road.
[102:40.23]Step one, get on the road.
[102:41.27]Go over the bridge.
[102:42.99]Step three, profit.
[102:44.09]Actually, you don't have to go over the bridge.
[102:45.37]You can just go straight.
[102:46.43]Step one, collect underpants.
[102:47.66]Step two, get underpants.
[102:49.26]Step three, profit.
[102:49.88]Step one, install video game.
[102:52.58]Can we get in the Winnebago?
[102:53.24]No.
[102:55.43]I wish we could.
[102:55.95]This is the first place we looted.
[102:57.46]This is where we got the yellow card from.
[102:58.66]That's right.
[102:59.16]Okay.
[102:59.60]So where are we going?
[103:01.98]Wherever you want.
[103:02.66]Let's go right in the middle.
[103:04.24]Let's go to Ragnarok.
[103:05.48]You be the shot caller.
[103:06.76]You tell me what to do.
[103:07.47]Alright.
[103:08.01]We're going to go to Ragnarok.
[103:10.63]And then we're going to make our way over to Lollapalooza.
[103:14.21]And then to Myrtle Beach.
[103:23.43]You want to do anything here?
[103:24.59]What do you think?
[103:25.13]If you want to.
[103:25.95]No, no, no.
[103:26.53]This is fucking small beans.
[103:29.91]I don't want to do small beans.
[103:31.01]I want big beans.
[103:31.39]Well, we're driving towards the school.
[103:33.22]Yep.
[103:33.92]That's what I wanted.

[103:55.47]That was loud.
[103:55.95]I saw that panic hit the brakes.
[104:00.85]Hit the brakes?
[104:02.27]No, you panicked and hit the brakes when you sneezed.
[104:05.77]Alright, let's take a look inside the paint factory.
[104:15.18]We're fine.

[104:56.99]I have an M16A4 with a scope on it.
[104:59.43]Wait, wait, wait.
[105:00.11]How come I can't use this?
[105:03.64]Don't I have an M?
[105:04.74]No, I don't.
[105:06.50]Get that.
[105:06.80]It's on the ground right next to me.

[105:15.37]Why do I hear explosions?
[105:16.25]It's perfectly normal.
[105:17.37]Perfectly normal.
[105:22.82]Come get this attachment, dude.
[105:25.42]Okay.

[105:32.48]Don't you get?
[105:32.96]Come on.

[105:41.11]I do have a head protector.
[105:43.15]So I'm going to get in this car, and I'm going to... How much gas is this?
[105:46.79]I've got full gas.
[105:48.70]Why don't you take the gas?
[105:49.44]There's a super special attachment.
[105:51.16]Over here.
[105:52.58]I'm in the garage right now.
[105:54.08]You take the gas, fill up your car, and then take the attachment, and then let's get out of here.
[106:05.94]Pick up the gas.
[106:07.36]Pick up the attachment.
[106:08.56]Let's get out of here.
[106:12.48]Where's this?
[106:12.96]Where's the... What attachment are you trying to make me pick up?
[106:15.00]Right here.
[106:15.62]I don't need that.
[106:16.20]It won't even fit on my gun.
[106:17.98]I asked you if you had a UMP.
[106:20.12]Did you?
[106:20.70]I asked you if you had any of those guns.
[106:23.26]No, I don't.
[106:23.88]This is not your car.
[106:25.85]Mine now.
[106:26.35]We're supposed to be taking separate... How did I not get in the driver's seat?
[106:29.93]Just get... I left the gas for you, too.
[106:34.25]You just decided not to pick it up.
[106:36.70]Okay.
[106:37.52]This is plenty of gas.
[106:41.48]Okay.
[106:42.26]You know, you can't... You can't do that.
[106:45.62]You're gonna get us both killed.
[106:47.02]I'm stuck.
[106:48.00]I'm stuck!
[106:49.86]Well, we're both stuck.
[106:53.61]Okay.
[106:54.55]What unnecessary damage we both just took.
[106:59.88]Okay, take us.
[107:00.83]What are you doing?
[107:01.85]Stop being so erratic.
[107:03.55]Where are you going?
[107:04.33]You're pushing me.
[107:04.83]I'm driving barefoot right now.
[107:06.61]You know you can't do that?
[107:08.19]My mother always told me, don't drive barefoot, it'll fuck you up.
[107:10.73]And it's true.
[107:16.66]Why am I doing what you're doing?
[107:18.44]You're influencing my puny brain.
[107:24.36]You go first.
[107:25.20]Okay, I'll go first.
[107:26.48]Wait, why do I have to go first?
[107:29.32]Because I don't want to I don't want to be the boss.
[107:31.74]Okay, so this is a hot zone, right?
[107:36.56]Oh, oh boy.
[107:38.18]Oh boy.
[107:39.62]Oh boy.
[107:41.52]Oh boy.
[107:42.78]Oh boy.
[107:44.84]Okay, I'm safe Where they they're at the red house right now, right?
[107:56.01]Yeah, not the front door but around the left-hand side.
[107:58.01]Oh
[108:00.84]Oh, he's right here.
[108:02.80]I'm gonna ram him.
[108:03.68]Should I ram him?
[108:05.74]Good luck.
[108:08.49]Run me over.
[108:08.89]Wait, so why did you walk at them?
[108:22.11]I didn't walk at them.
[108:22.83]I was hiding behind my car.
[108:23.89]I got out of my car and I was behind it shooting at them.
[108:28.87]I had a helmet on.
[108:30.94]Yeah, that should protect you.
[108:32.54]Well, I had a helmet on.
[108:33.46]I had a vest on.
[108:34.40]What?
[108:39.04]Alright, so you're telling me that I got shot like two times and died?
[108:44.82]Well, in the head, probably.
[108:46.56]I had a helmet on.
[108:47.24]Well, twice in the head.
[108:50.69]That's a lot of bullets in the head.
[108:54.51]Dude, the guy just like aimed in the car and instantly killed me.
[108:57.25]It was like, I'm just dead.
[109:01.12]Outta way, man.
[109:01.80]They're using hacks.
[109:04.12]Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[109:05.76]We're gonna go to the hot zone until you get a kill.
[109:08.32]That dude got two headshots in a row?
[109:11.38]From that far away?
[109:12.38]And I was like driving around like a fucking maniac?
[109:15.60]What if he had three round burst on?
[109:18.92]Look, we're not gonna do the looting thing.
[109:20.12]We're gonna go to the hot zones until you get a kill.
[109:25.08]So, no more like waste time looting.
[109:27.42]You have to get a kill there.
[109:29.60]It's a bike helmet?
[109:35.39]He was in front of Etalyx.
[109:36.35]Yeah, well, whatever.
[109:40.39]I was in a car.
[109:43.14]You gotta shoot through the glass.
[109:45.10]Hit me in the face two times in a row right in my nose.
[109:49.82]I died in less than like a quarter of a second.
[109:53.96]With like a bunch of body armor and a helmet on.
[109:59.63]The guy that killed you was about 15 feet in front of me.
[110:03.21]Yeah, I was driving up behind you.
[110:05.05]I was probably 30 or 40 feet behind your body.
[110:07.97]I was like a good 60, 70 fucking meters away.
[110:11.22]And I got instantly killed.
[110:15.80]That's why we're not going to waste time running around looting stuff.
[110:18.76]We're just going to go and fight.
[110:21.02]So this is a game that you're not supposed to have fun in?
[110:22.76]You're supposed to just try to win?
[110:25.71]Well, we're going to have fun right now.
[110:27.87]It requires gamers that play shooters.
[110:31.91]Hey, you don't play shooters.
[110:34.57]Burn.
[110:35.52]Double burn.
[110:36.42]Both of us.
[110:36.84]Yeah, shooters.
[110:37.42]What was the last shooter you played besides Overwatch?
[110:41.66]Like Red Orchestra 2, like four years ago?
[110:43.72]Yeah, Red Orchestra 2.
[110:45.12]That one.
[110:46.58]I played that one.
[110:53.97]Alright, we're going to the pit.
[110:57.85]We're going to train.
[111:03.35]My problem is I'm just not taking the game seriously.
[111:07.48]I have to like take the game.
[111:08.68]Okay.
[111:09.22]I have to take the game seriously.
[111:12.46]And that's something I don't think I'm capable of.
[111:14.32]Three, two, one, go.
[111:18.08]It's east.
[111:19.46]East.
[111:20.50]Okay, that way.
[111:22.62]We're going to the pit.
[111:26.68]Why don't you and Etalyx play Rising Storm 2?
[111:29.02]I can only think of... That's the one game I can think of that would make you rage the fastest, I think.
[111:38.01]I'm not getting angry at this game.
[111:39.53]I'm having fun.
[111:40.39]No, I didn't say you were.
[111:41.27]I just remember the one time we played Red Orchestra 2.
[111:43.07]Oh, yeah.
[111:43.57]It didn't go well.
[111:46.26]No, it did not go well.
[111:47.12]Alright, so I'm going to... I'm not going to go for one of the dirty buildings.
[111:50.92]There's a lot of people here.
[111:52.58]There's so many people here.
[111:56.22]I'm going for the dirty building.
[111:58.54]No, I'm going for the clean building.
[112:00.48]I'm just going to go for a building, whichever one I land in front of.
[112:03.88]Which is probably going to be this one right here.
[112:05.56]This one right in the middle.
[112:14.04]That's like a fucking stupid toy.
[112:17.66]I got a shirt.
[112:19.10]Nice.
[112:20.80]I got a fucking first aid kit.
[112:22.74]Got a shotgun?
[112:24.92]I'm coming to you.
[112:26.93]This thing that says I eat ass.
[112:27.95]Okay, I got a gun.
[112:38.83]I got a frying pan.
[112:40.95]I shot that guy like two times.
[112:41.87]He's in front of you.
[112:44.99]He's got a frying pan running around.
[112:46.25]The guy with the gun in the front of the building?
[112:48.31]He's going to see you?
[112:58.63]Where's frying pan guy?
[113:01.43]Don't go in that building.
[113:02.53]Did it already.
[113:03.55]Don't go in that building.
[113:04.43]Too late.
[113:05.41]That is a death trap.
[113:08.28]Where the fuck did... Oh, shit.
[113:09.70]I'm getting smoked.
[113:13.28]Where did this guy go?
[113:13.96]Did this guy, like, disappear?
[113:26.25]I killed one.
[113:36.90]There's a guy up here.
[113:38.86]On the stairs.
[113:41.01]Alright, just be patient.
[113:42.09]Be patient, gamer.
[113:42.99]I'm coming to you.
[113:44.01]There's two guys outside of your building.
[113:46.43]They went to a second building.
[113:47.43]I don't want to attack them.
[113:55.02]Be careful when you come in.
[113:55.78]There's a guy just sitting upstairs.
[113:59.20]Watch yourself.
[114:03.87]There's two more guys in the house that you're facing.
[114:07.31]If you go past the wall you're looking at.
[114:09.33]There's a guy just upstairs.
[114:13.55]It's freaking me out.
[114:15.29]Are you just running in?
[114:17.39]Just be patient.
[114:18.50]If he has a rifle, he'll try to use it from the hall.
[114:22.28]He's on the roof.
[114:24.28]Go watch the stairs right here.
[114:25.68]How the hell did he get there?
[114:28.14]Actually, there's three floors.
[114:32.40]Is he gone?
[114:33.26]Yeah.
[114:33.58]He's knocked out.
[114:34.50]There's another guy.
[114:39.90]I got a heal.
[114:41.08]That guy was already dead.
[114:41.74]Okay.
[114:42.22]Just making sure.
[114:42.78]That guy.
[114:43.06]Just making sure.
[114:44.64]There might be one more.
[114:45.54]There's a lot of shit.
[114:46.85]This guy had a lot of shit.
[114:48.05]I'll cover you.
[114:48.69]This guy had like an M16.
[114:56.11]He had no ammo for it.
[114:58.81]Oh, you took the ammo?
[115:00.29]Alex, I don't know what's happening.
[115:02.11]I'm scared right now.
[115:02.85]I'm freaking the fuck out.
[115:03.83]Here, let me go clear the other room.
[115:11.83]I gotta take this stuff first.
[115:23.16]Black shirt.
[115:24.84]There could still be somebody hiding in one of these rooms.
[115:26.80]Just FYI.
[115:27.96]And there's still two more people in this area.
[115:40.52]I don't think there's anybody else in here.
[115:41.82]And this at least up here, somewhere up here.
[115:45.64]Suppressor.
[115:46.52]So watch the windows.
[115:48.08]They can't see us here, but this house right here that I'm looking at, that's the last place I saw them.
[115:54.05]Really?
[115:56.18]Interesting.
[115:56.52]They could be gone by now, but... Beware, beware.
[116:07.42]Don't be scared.
[116:08.04]I'm overburdened?
[116:08.92]What?
[116:11.40]Why do I have this?
[116:13.82]Can't even use those fucking things.
[116:19.00]Do you have energy drinks?
[116:20.62]I do not.
[116:21.30]I have first aid, though.
[116:25.76]Here.
[116:28.36]Drop the energy drink, scroll all the way down.
[116:31.82]Go ahead and drink it.
[116:32.76]I got it.
[116:33.94]Drinks and painkillers are the only thing that can heal you back to full.
[116:40.37]Okay.
[116:49.84]Since we seem to be alone in here.
[116:51.88]Seem to be.
[116:52.44]I'm just going to check some things out.
[116:56.00]They got a backpack?
[116:58.50]Thought I already had one on.
[117:09.57]The glasses are more important.
[117:12.49]Did you get some steampunk goggles?
[117:16.65]I picked up like the glasses and I left the fucking backpack.
[117:20.95]That is funny.
[117:28.84]now what's the deal uh just finishing clearing out these rooms ammo for your gun and I'm gonna take this first aid kit and we can go dude I need a give me put this on my guy looks so cool now do you have body armor at all uh I do not have body armor is there one in this room yeah
[117:54.78]Right there.
[117:56.28]And now we go.
[118:04.80]Just be aware when we run out, they might be watching the front door or something stupid.
[118:10.10]I can imagine they would do something like that.
[118:13.07]So if we go out, don't run straight down the middle.
[118:16.93]I don't think so.
[118:24.38]I think we're good.
[118:26.12]I say that now, but I think we might be good.
[118:37.59]Okay, you're checking the rooms and I'm checking the same rooms.
[118:40.89]Just in case.
[118:41.59]You're dad.
[118:42.53]I'm like the little boy.
[118:43.53]Like, my dad did it.
[118:44.37]I'll go do it too.
[118:45.15]That's how I learn how to play this game.
[118:47.22]Learn by example.
[118:48.30]I learned that daddy did it, then I do it.
[118:50.34]And that's how I learn.
[118:52.52]The reason I'm running down here is because frequently a car or a motorcycle will spawn.
[119:01.71]Down this road, and then we don't have to run the whole way, which would be really nice.
[119:05.51]Don't worry, Daddy Etalyx is here.
[119:07.51]I think we got unlucky this time.
[119:14.60]Watch out for the weird house.
[119:18.66]I don't like you without your gun out of town because it makes us feel vulnerable.
[119:21.54]I gotta run faster because there's not a stupid vehicle here.
[119:23.98]Yeah, what's up with that?
[119:25.60]I don't want to spin the whole stream.
[119:27.58]Run stream.
[119:28.42]It's not DayZ stream.
[119:31.16]What's up with that?
[119:37.06]Did you kill anybody just there?
[119:40.08]I did not do anything.
[119:41.00]Well, I killed... No, no, no.
[119:42.12]I did.
[119:42.36]I did.
[119:42.70]I killed somebody.
[119:43.86]The guy that ran down the stairs after you.
[119:46.69]Was that the guy that was downed?
[119:48.27]Nope.
[119:49.45]That was his friend that ran down the stairs.
[119:50.93]So you got to kill on stream.
[119:52.37]Kill on stream is what I'm saying.
[119:57.29]I'm not going to get my gun out yet.
[120:01.56]So what you want to... Cars normally spawn on roads.
[120:03.96]So whenever we cross a road...
[120:07.95]Just look left.
[120:09.03]Look right.
[120:09.43]You know, cross the street like you would in real life.
[120:12.59]He was down?
[120:13.15]No, he wasn't.
[120:13.55]He ran like right in front of me.
[120:19.21]No, we don't tell him.
[120:19.85]We don't tell Alex what I did after.
[120:21.19]I think I hear a car coming up behind us.
[120:26.67]What?
[120:27.28]Probably on the road.
[120:28.62]Should we?
[120:30.88]There.
[120:31.02]Yep.
[120:31.30]Yep.
[120:31.42]Yep.
[120:31.54]Yep.
[120:34.18]I got a hit.
[120:34.78]I got at least one hit.
[120:38.02]I think I did, too.
[120:38.56]I did, too, Daddy.
[120:40.12]Dad, I got one, too.
[120:42.60]So you shot it, I shot it, I did it.
[120:48.16]Okay, that's a loud noise.
[120:49.36]The only thing we need to be careful of is they may get out and wait for us to run at them.
[120:56.17]So we might even go to these houses up ahead.
[121:00.51]Possible, for sure.
[121:05.08]Something we are prepared for.
[121:07.53]I'll go first.
[121:10.79]People gave money, like, over the course of the last hour.
[121:13.01]Do you want to wait here?
[121:14.05]No, no, no.
[121:14.39]Open another car.
[121:16.17]Pretty far away.
[121:17.13]Where?
[121:17.51]Oh.
[121:18.69]Don't shoot.
[121:19.11]I wouldn't... Well... Don't shoot?
[121:21.07]Make sure you have cover.
[121:28.47]Did I do a good job?
[121:29.47]Did I do a good job?
[121:31.01]Hey, Daddy!
[121:33.29]You want to, like, hide in one of these houses and thank the money men?
[121:37.77]No, dude, I went down with the wrong.
[121:44.74]Careful, Etalyx.
[121:45.86]That's a hot zone.
[121:48.72]Another car?
[121:50.64]Oh, where is it?
[121:52.35]It's right here, right behind us.
[121:57.63]It's all blood.
[121:58.87]I got him twice.
[122:02.47]I hit that guy two times.
[122:03.41]Too bad he didn't die.
[122:06.81]Nobody's stopping on the road, huh?
[122:13.45]What is this shit?
[122:18.38]Oh.
[122:19.84]UMP?
[122:21.08]Well, too bad I don't have anything for the UMP.
[122:24.44]I've got ammo if you want it.
[122:28.32]Maybe.
[122:29.38]Oh god, oh god, Etalyx, Etalyx, Etalyx.
[122:30.78]The thing, the thing, the thing is coming.
[122:32.52]The blue death thing is... No, we've got three minutes and 16 seconds.
[122:36.58]I ran us inside the new safe zone, so we've got three minutes.
[122:40.32]Okay.
[122:42.58]The problem is, it's going to be at military base, and this is always awful.
[122:46.92]Because we have to drive over a bridge.
[122:49.44]Oh.
[122:50.82]And last time I did that, a squad of four people had created a roadblock out of vehicles.
[122:59.17]And mow down every single person that went through.
[123:01.55]I have another five bandages.
[123:04.71]There's an assault rifle in here with ammo for your gun, I think.
[123:08.85]Really?
[123:13.10]Hey, would you look at that?
[123:13.80]Do you have enough bandages?
[123:16.66]I have, like, a lot.
[123:18.14]I got a first aid kit and a few bandages.
[123:20.70]Okay.
[123:24.22]One of the reasons you want to bind bandages to a hotkey is because they suck.
[123:28.03]Yeah, I still haven't done that.
[123:31.29]Okay, so we don't have time to loot the other houses.
[123:34.53]So we're just going to run and hope nobody else is running behind us.
[123:38.80]And I thought I saw a car down here.
[123:43.74]They might have gotten out of this.
[123:45.28]We shot at this thing, didn't we?
[123:47.92]I believe so.
[123:48.54]Unless there's another one.
[123:52.61]Can I get on this?
[123:53.85]Oh my god, I can.
[123:55.21]Okay, this is bad.
[123:56.43]You are a real big target.
[123:58.04]This is a little dangerous, yeah.
[123:59.50]Would you rather drive in the fun buggy or the UAZ just ahead of us?
[124:03.64]Um, fun buggy.
[124:04.92]Okay, you're gonna die, like, immediately.
[124:10.92]Just FYI.
[124:11.99]Fun buggy, let's go.
[124:13.05]I'm standing up.
[124:17.27]We're gonna cross the bridge, that's where we're gonna die.
[124:19.51]I'm surfing on your car.
[124:25.44]Is that?
[124:26.26]Okay, there's a car in front of us.
[124:27.30]Should we Mad Max him?
[124:31.87]What are you doing?
[124:33.13]I think he's getting out.
[124:34.09]I don't want them to have the advantage.
[124:35.73]Oh, yeah.
[124:36.13]Make sure they don't have the advantage and just tip us over.
[124:40.69]There's another fun buggy.
[124:43.25]Daleks!
[124:44.35]Daleks.
[124:44.65]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[124:45.27]Fun buggy right there to the left.
[124:48.75]Get up and get back on that road.
[124:55.44]Where's the fun buggy?
[124:56.26]Straight ahead.
[124:59.20]There's a lot of people here.
[125:00.36]Yep.
[125:01.30]They're on this bridge.
[125:02.52]Alright.
[125:07.03]We can technically stop here without crossing the bridge yet.
[125:10.37]Okay.
[125:11.49]So I have to know what... Don't run me over.
[125:15.81]I have to know what you want to do first.
[125:17.87]I mean, what can, what should we do?
[125:20.47]We're going to have to cross the bridge.
[125:23.69]You just need to know that when... I heard something.
[125:26.72]Sounds like a buggy or a motorcycle.
[125:31.44]Do you have any painkillers or drinks?
[125:34.69]I do not.
[125:36.25]Oh, man.
[125:36.55]I can't have a party.
[125:37.39]There are painkillers right here, though.
[125:40.55]Okay.
[125:43.89]Take them.
[125:50.61]go find a boat.
[125:51.29]Anyway, what we have to decide is we're going to drive over that bridge.
[125:53.77]There will be people waiting at the other end of the bridge to shoot us.
[125:56.22]Of course they will.
[125:56.68]Of course.
[125:57.72]That's like the strategy.
[125:58.82]You sit at the end of the fucking bridge and you wait till... There's a car coming up.
[126:02.20]Wait, what?
[126:03.22]There's a car coming up from the north.
[126:10.13]There's a military vest level three here if you want it.
[126:12.87]Sure.
[126:15.89]So do you want to cross it now?
[126:17.87]No, do you want to wait for the car?
[126:18.85]Or later?
[126:19.19]Where's this car you're talking about?
[126:22.23]do you hear the shooting over there I guess that's them what are they shooting at I don't know they can't blow up the gas station can they no no no blowing up the guy I can't tell no that's the tree but what everyone everyone is saying boat boat boat boat there are boats in this game I just don't know where they spawn are they like over here I have no idea
[126:53.85]So if you want to come inside of this building that we're in, this crappy little building.
[126:57.30]Right.
[126:57.76]We are right on the white line.
[126:59.58]Mm-hmm.
[127:01.38]You hear the car?
[127:02.22]Make sure you're not visible through the window.
[127:05.40]So just, like, go prone or... How do you prone?
[127:09.02]Z. They're stopping here.
[127:11.60]Yeah, they are.
[127:12.08]Alright.
[127:12.55]Oh, there's another car.
[127:13.17]Another car.
[127:13.49]There's opportunity.
[127:14.39]There's two cars here.
[127:16.55]Opportunity.
[127:17.33]Opportunity.
[127:18.99]Got three hits on a foot.
[127:25.11]They're behind the wall?
[127:26.84]Like the wall I'm looking at right now?
[127:28.10]Yeah, they're on the right side of it.
[127:37.02]No, they're not.
[127:39.26]They might have moved around into the... Oh, that's a grenade!
[127:45.70]Where the fuck are they?
[127:47.82]I got a first aid.
[127:49.86]He's sniping at you through the window.
[127:51.20]Oh shit, my fucking god.
[127:52.46]Another grenade?
[127:59.61]Another grenade!
[128:00.91]Another grenade!
[128:02.23]They're trying to smoke us out, Etalyx.
[128:04.37]They're trying to smoke us out.
[128:05.25]There's so many grenades!
[128:06.07]They're trying to smoke us out.
[128:07.29]This is like fucking... Oh, oh, oh!
[128:13.26]Oh, shit!
[128:14.36]Crawl to me.
[128:17.74]They're gonna rush.
[128:18.72]Go, go, go, go, go.
[128:21.66]I can't pick you up.
[128:22.26]There's guns in the way.
[128:25.67]Hang on.
[128:27.61]Did I... God damn.
[128:31.63]It's just like... Okay, dude, like, this is... I'll tell you why I don't like these games.
[128:37.25]Here's what I'm gonna explain.
[128:39.32]It's like 20 minutes of, like, silence, and then, like, nine seconds of terrifying explosions and death.
[128:51.20]It's like 20 minutes of silence, and then...
[129:07.24]So when I was trying to revive you, you would hit F to revive.
[129:11.51]And there happened to be a gun underneath you.
[129:14.71]You were reviving the gun?
[129:16.33]Yeah, I was reviving the gun.
[129:22.66]That's how the real world works.
[129:29.50]People that say that are just bad at these games.
[129:32.26]Yeah, I mean, I'm bad at the game, but that is what the game is.
[129:42.29]Well, you know, what it is if you win, there's like 15 minutes of silence, then like two minutes of action, you kill those guys, then two minutes of action, you kill those guys, then, you know, it equals out if you survive the first two minutes.
[129:56.57]Just look at that scenario we were just in right there.
[129:58.77]It was like six grenades were used on our house.
[130:02.86]And there was like three cars rolling up, it was just a fucking shit show.
[130:05.16]Yeah, but the grenades didn't kill us.
[130:08.29]Yeah, well, the grenades didn't get us.
[130:09.73]No, it's a patience thing.
[130:10.83]It was bullets.
[130:12.31]I don't like lying on the ground.
[130:14.19]I want to run around and shoot people.
[130:15.62]Yeah, you can.
[130:16.52]You can do that as long as you kill them before they kill you.
[130:21.36]So that's what they did.
[130:23.04]See, if you flip it around, what they did is run up and kill us.
[130:26.19]So we could be those people.
[130:28.33]What's the highest place we've gotten?
[130:29.45]Six.
[130:31.21]But don't worry, we didn't do anything.
[130:38.91]I mean, like I said, I can see the appeal, for sure.
[130:41.79]The game is definitely fun and interesting.
[130:46.49]I don't think it's a bad game.
[130:48.48]I think it's really fucking cool, actually.
[130:59.79]Alright, it's action time.
[131:00.65]It just requires extreme patience and skill.
[131:03.37]And those are two things I don't have.
[131:05.09]Well, you can take the patience out of the equation because we're going to the elementary school.
[131:08.79]Okay.
[131:16.93]Get ready to drop.
[131:19.10]Three, two, one, go.
[131:25.86]Ragnarok.
[131:33.14]Why does the elementary school have more guns than the military base?
[131:36.90]You know, that is a pretty good question.
[131:43.69]Because it was where they holed up, you know, in the apocalypse.
[131:47.19]I've been going straight down this whole time.
[131:48.81]I better be, like, one of the first people here.
[131:50.13]I don't know.
[131:54.13]I'm not even sure where I'm supposed to go.
[131:55.95]Well... Should I go right, like, in the center?
[131:58.63]I wouldn't, but... Good luck.
[132:01.55]I wouldn't.
[132:03.15]Well, there's this one.
[132:04.14]Why do I slow?
[132:05.04]I'm so slow.
[132:14.22]Shit.
[132:15.72]Shit.
[132:19.85]Oh my god, what is this?
[132:20.83]A smoke grenade.
[132:26.05]What do I do that for?
[132:26.65]I don't know.
[132:26.93]Wait, there's a gun up here.
[132:46.48]Coming to you?
[132:47.50]Oh, what the- some guy just like fucking freaked out and ran by so fast it was like a horror movie, I swear to God.
[132:51.24]Alright, if you can live for like 10 more seconds, I will try to help you.
[132:56.73]I'm so scared to pick the rest of this shit up.
[133:02.27]Yeah.
[133:04.55]I'm in the building with you.
[133:05.42]Okay.
[133:11.42]Did you throw the smoke grenade?
[133:13.28]Yeah.
[133:14.10]Oh, okay.
[133:21.26]Want to take some pot shots?
[133:24.92]Two guys on the roof.
[133:26.94]On the roof?
[133:27.98]Of the other building.
[133:28.60]I'm going to wait.
[133:34.81]I heard click, click.
[133:54.36]both on the roof again everybody else here they're on the other roof I'm looking at the uh opposite I'm just waiting watching the stairs I don't see anything I don't think they're gonna come in they're like trying they just went down into the school so there's two people like on the second floor of the school okay well okay people that can kill us that's true
[134:23.17]There's a UMP, if you feel brave, on the other side of the lockers.
[134:39.42]Alright, so you have to decide now if you want to run into the school and get killed or survive and have 20 minutes of nothing happening.
[134:50.41]Alright, let's survive.
[134:52.44]No, I want to go kill the guys in the school.
[134:54.22]Alright, let's do that, and then let's survive.
[135:00.40]First, I want to finish looting this stuff.
[135:07.34]What a shitty pool.
[135:08.34]Guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy, guy in here.
[135:10.20]How do I get out of this?
[135:15.27]He went for me.
[135:15.81]Fucking single shot.
[135:17.05]It should be on auto.
[135:17.83]Why is it?
[135:18.31]It should be on auto at first.
[135:19.43]Baseball cap.
[135:19.81]I have a heal.
[135:20.43]Bruh.
[135:21.71]Okay.
[135:21.99]Yep.
[135:22.33]I'm ready.
[135:23.03]I'm just going to cover you.
[135:25.67]There might be a door behind you as well.
[135:27.10]So just careful.
[135:30.80]You got a guy.
[135:31.46]I'm so proud.
[135:32.40]He did it.
[135:33.88]Who puts a UMP like this on single shot?
[135:36.26]Every gun starts single shot.
[135:37.72]Why?
[135:38.42]Fix it.
[135:38.74]Did that guy have anything?
[135:42.03]I haven't checked yet.
[135:43.25]Uh, yeah, gas mask, some shit, a shotgun, first aid.
[135:48.17]Thank you for saving my life.
[135:49.73]You're so welcome.
[135:51.93]Okay.
[135:53.54]I'm ready to go.
[135:59.88]That was probably one of the guys.
[136:02.26]Did he instantly die, or did he go down?
[136:03.99]No, he's dead.
[136:05.85]Okay, so there's still two people left inside the school?
[136:08.83]I think he did die.
[136:09.97]Wait, this place is gonna get bombed in five seconds.
[136:12.35]Guy up top.
[136:13.05]Top window, window, window, window.
[136:18.62]I gotta hit on him.
[136:20.82]Oh, watch this shit.
[136:21.74]Is he on the roof?
[136:22.76]No, he's in the building.
[136:23.84]Watch this one.
[136:27.58]Oh, give me those PogChamps!
[136:29.91]SHIT!
[136:34.76]Why did it do that?
[136:35.40]The indicator said it was going in the fucking window.
[136:37.46]Dude, what happened?
[136:39.58]I tried to throw a grenade in that window and the indicator said it was going in the window and then it hit the roof.
[136:49.07]What?
[136:49.31]Come on.
[136:50.81]That was perfect.
[136:52.17]What was wrong with that?
[136:53.05]Alright, they're in here somewhere.
[136:58.41]This place is getting bombed, right?
[136:59.53]Yeah, it's okay.
[137:01.11]It's okay?
[137:04.45]Watch the back.
[137:07.32]Watch the stairs.
[137:08.06]You're right next to the stairs.
[137:11.63]So if they're above... I can't tell.
[137:17.75]Alright, let me go first.
[137:36.16]careful already died right here huh they're just sitting still I can almost guarantee you they are sitting still waiting for us to come up the stairs probably so
[138:00.73]The trick is there's two sets of stairs.
[138:02.24]So what do you want to do?
[138:03.06]I mean, I can run up.
[138:03.98]I say we push the opposite set.
[138:05.66]So I'm going to go first.
[138:06.96]Should I pull the shotgun for this?
[138:09.68]I wouldn't.
[138:10.04]I would go UMP.
[138:10.56]UMP.
[138:12.08]And just hold the button down until they die.
[138:14.74]Ready?
[138:14.96]I'm going to go opposite stairs.
[138:16.88]There's a guy right there.
[138:17.65]I hit him a few times.
[138:23.23]He's hurt.
[138:24.15]He's very hurt.
[138:27.80]god damn it so am I you knocked him out I did yeah okay should I go for it his friend is I need I'm dumb hurt is his friend sitting right there I have five bandage I just dropped them but that's all I got I got I have first aid kit dude I'm good is he still alive around the left corner there's a different guy he's dead
[138:51.27]I killed his friend.
[138:52.25]Nope.
[138:52.81]He's around the corner.
[138:53.61]Well, I mean, I killed, like, the guy that was on the ground.
[138:55.11]Alright, just watch the hall.
[138:56.33]He might charge me.
[138:57.15]Just watch the hall.
[138:57.95]Just where that other guy just died?
[138:59.99]Yeah, he's right there.
[139:00.71]He's right there.
[139:01.33]He's right to the left.
[139:01.91]To the left.
[139:02.72]He's literally right to the left of that room.
[139:04.00]I have, like, two hits and I'm dead.
[139:05.04]Me too.
[139:09.04]Here he is.
[139:11.06]I think I'm gonna... I think I'm gonna... I think I'm gonna... I think I'm gonna do it.
[139:13.30]I'm gonna freak this guy out.
[139:15.64]He can't get to me unless he goes through you, so...
[139:19.95]Let me know if he peeks and then I'll... I mean, he's been like peeking, he's peeking now.
[139:23.39]He's like going back and forth, back and forth.
[139:25.67]His friend's gonna die if he doesn't get to him, so... He... Duh!
[139:30.75]What the hell?
[139:32.05]I'm knocked out with a grenade.
[139:33.38]He's gonna charge me in a second.
[139:34.92]Somebody's behind us, I think.
[139:36.56]No, that was... He threw a grenade into my room, so all you gotta do is watch the hall.
[139:42.20]Or charge.
[139:43.62]God, what the fuck?
[139:45.28]How much health did he have?
[139:46.16]What?
[139:47.60]What?
[139:49.90]What?
[139:52.34]No, 20 minutes of silence.
[139:53.72]That's all action.
[139:54.72]How much health did that guy have?
[139:55.82]I thought we hit him like four times.
[140:00.08]He may have healed.
[140:01.94]I had a first aid, I know, but if I were to heal and he came around the corner, it's 10 seconds.
[140:12.43]I don't play these games.
[140:13.89]Hey, you got two kills, didn't you?
[140:16.35]I did.
[140:17.59]There you go.
[140:20.28]More than I got.
[140:21.06]Actually, I got one.
[140:22.14]Yeah, so still more.
[140:23.06]Look, you guys are watching me learn how to play this genre of video game.
[140:29.88]You guys are watching me live blindly learn how to play this genre of fucking video game.
[140:36.53]Give me some slack.
[140:41.71]But yeah, as someone else is pointing out, if you're ever in a heal situation and you need to shoot, any button click will cancel your heal to let you shoot.
[140:51.55]This is not our 20th game.
[140:53.69]This is like our fucking 6th game.
[141:03.22]Stop being such a sad sack.
[141:05.38]I'm not being a sad sack.
[141:09.28]Alright, while we're loading in, I'll be right back.
[141:19.93]Why is the character so tall?
[141:20.95]I don't know.
[141:25.15]Sad sack.
[141:29.54]Plays game for over six hours.
[141:32.20]Okay.
[141:32.78]I've been streaming for two hours and 21 minutes.
[141:35.72]That's the entire time I've played this video game.
[141:40.33]Me and Etalyx played a game where he taught me the buttons.
[141:43.71]And then I turned the stream on.
[141:46.87]You understand?
[141:49.74]Did you watch the fucking learning process?
[141:57.06]There has to be a grace period before the streamer sucks effect can be taken about that.
[142:00.34]Thank you Is that the grace period it's like 10 hours, you know, it's like 50 hours before you get like yelled at Liar he's stuttering.
[142:21.15]No, I'm not I
[142:28.22]Leave me alone.
[142:29.04]I'm just trying to play video games.
[142:33.06]Okay, so what's the situation?
[142:34.70]What's the deal?
[142:35.40]I turned off my stream.
[142:36.82]Etalyx.
[142:37.40]My stream's over.
[142:37.98]I turned it off.
[142:38.48]I got too upset with everybody.
[142:39.62]Oh, thank God.
[142:40.20]Everybody was making fun of me, and I was like, I'm out of here.
[142:43.04]And I was like, I'm out of here.
[142:44.94]I'm gone.
[142:45.32]Alright, where are we going?
[142:48.46]Actually, I don't know.
[142:49.48]Everywhere here sucks.
[142:50.12]Do you want to fight people?
[142:51.42]Let's fight people.
[142:52.06]My voice is raspy.
[142:53.40]Get out.
[142:53.84]Go south.
[142:54.38]Right now.
[142:55.16]It is kind of raspy right now.
[142:56.24]I don't know why.
[142:58.12]This gigantic complex is the military compound.
[143:01.22]Cool.
[143:02.61]I don't really know where the good spots to loot are, but I know a lot of people go here.
[143:09.23]I'm not... This is fun.
[143:10.75]I like this.
[143:12.81]I mean, would I play this every day on stream?
[143:14.45]No.
[143:16.51]But, I mean, this is like... This is cool.
[143:18.29]I like it.
[143:19.54]Okay, do you see the trio of three buildings?
[143:23.50]Uh... Closest to us?
[143:24.32]The big ones?
[143:25.28]Yes.
[143:25.46]Okay.
[143:26.56]Those are the ones everyone's going to be landing on.
[143:28.92]So I should not land there, then?
[143:31.17]Well, you can land, but probably not on the roof.
[143:33.91]What about the Lego?
[143:35.77]The Lego?
[143:36.49]On the left.
[143:37.23]On the left?
[143:38.11]Not as good.
[143:39.52]These big apartment buildings is where all the good stuff is.
[143:41.90]Well, who knows what's about to happen?
[143:43.82]I'm just landing on the blue and yellow boxcars.
[143:48.42]Or, like, near them.
[143:49.51]See what I can do.
[144:00.58]Did I get the gloves?
[144:03.34]I don't even know.
[144:03.88]I'm too scared.
[144:13.71]What happened?
[144:16.67]Nothing.
[144:16.93]Nothing happened.
[144:18.96]How did you die?
[144:21.14]Went into the house with the guy.
[144:22.30]He got the gun first.
[144:23.58]Oh.
[144:25.46]I'll just watch you.
[144:30.83]I feel like I'm just being chased.
[144:32.65]It's so horrible.
[144:33.49]I don't like it.
[144:33.99]A guy just ran this way.
[144:45.52]He died in that building?
[144:56.86]I heard a Ratatouille over here.
[145:07.38]Did you do it full auto?
[145:08.68]I did.
[145:10.17]God, I'm so scared.
[145:12.01]Alright, fuck it.
[145:12.53]I'm going.
[145:12.87]You're looking the wrong way.
[145:17.17]They're going to be in those big buildings that you're currently running in the middle of.
[145:20.45]I know.
[145:25.32]I know.
[145:25.72]Etalyx.
[145:26.20]Etalyx.
[145:26.58]This building right here that you're going in, you're actually going on the roof.
[145:31.18]They're going down.
[145:35.35]I don't understand the bullet drop in the game yet.
[145:36.63]I have no idea.
[145:37.13]There's no bullet drop.
[145:38.17]What do you mean?
[145:38.65]You told me there was a bullet drop.
[145:39.49]This is travel time.
[145:40.95]Not from this distance.
[145:42.91]Just aim where you want to hit.
[145:45.99]And also get cover.
[145:47.57]You mean fucking run like this so they can't fucking hit you?
[145:50.56]Uh, yeah.
[145:51.90]You got it.
[145:55.78]Uh... You're getting there.
[145:56.56]You're almost to cover.
[146:00.42]There's no ammo there.
[146:03.32]Oh wait, that's a shotgun.
[146:04.82]Never mind.
[146:05.26]Why am I the first person?
[146:07.36]Did you hit B?
[146:08.91]B?
[146:09.99]V as in valley?
[146:16.51]Where the hell did he go?
[146:17.71]He's still in cover, I think.
[146:18.84]Left side of that building that you're looking at?
[146:21.38]Nope.
[146:21.68]Not the left building.
[146:22.56]The building you were... Right there.
[146:23.92]No, look left.
[146:25.06]He's on the roof.
[146:30.11]I can't see with these eye insights.
[146:32.17]I can't do it.
[146:33.49]I can't do it.
[146:34.15]I'm not going to be able to do it.
[146:35.97]You guys think I'm going to... Look left.
[146:38.17]Stop shouting commands at me.
[146:39.85]It's too much.
[146:40.43]I'm trying to help you live.
[146:46.58]Okay.
[146:47.08]I'm not going to say a word.
[146:48.42]I'm just hearing you be like, go that way.
[146:50.50]Turn.
[146:55.20]Hey, some of us play with two earbuds.
[146:57.16]I don't.
[146:58.97]There's your problem.
[146:59.79]We found out, chat.
[147:03.39]That's why we're having so much difficulty.
[147:04.81]I can't wear two earphones.
[147:05.80]It'll make me throw up.
[147:06.52]Don't you understand that?
[147:09.36]I thought you knew that.
[147:14.90]There's so much shit here.
[147:17.64]I gotta look cool when I die.
[147:18.76]Alright, fuck it.
[147:22.10]I'm just going out.
[147:26.78]There he is.
[147:33.37]I can't see through there.
[147:34.55]I really can't.
[147:36.31]I am leaning into my fucking screen to see.
[147:41.01]You can zoom in a little bit if you hold shift, but you can only do it for a brief time.
[147:45.48]It's like holding your breath.
[147:51.64]There's two guys here.
[147:56.26]I'm so dead.
[148:04.70]I'm so fucking dead.
[148:06.52]They got in a car.
[148:09.91]Am I hitting the fence?
[148:11.39]I have no idea.
[148:12.09]Yeah, and stay out!
[148:17.51]God.
[148:25.16]I need, like, ammo, too.
[148:26.26]Twelve whole bullets.
[148:31.55]Well, I'm like here alone pretty much, so I'm just going to run around and get stuff.
[148:34.83]I did kind of die at the beginning of the round.
[148:37.83]That's on me.
[148:42.74]I don't know.
[148:50.83]How am I still alive?
[148:51.53]I have no idea.
[148:52.65]Don't ask me why I'm still alive.
[149:09.42]So you got two options.
[149:10.70]You can shoot in the middle of all those buildings and make as much noise as you can.
[149:15.90]Try to get someone to come over here.
[149:20.11]Or you can play it out and see how far you can get.
[149:23.19]Or we can abort and restart.
[149:25.73]I'm just going to try to attract as many people.
[149:28.46]I'm going to try to shoot the car and make the horde come.
[149:35.50]Oh, guy.
[149:36.02]Straight ahead.
[149:36.62]In the building.
[149:37.38]In that... No, the left.
[149:38.70]The two-car garage.
[149:40.29]Right there.
[149:49.81]I can't... I cannot... Call of Duty gamer!
[149:51.67]I cannot play this game.
[149:54.42]I shot the guy like... I didn't hit him.
[149:56.56]I shot like five times and didn't hit him once.
[149:59.56]So, in that scenario, what we learned is don't leave cover.
[150:04.91]Uh, don't charge him.
[150:06.47]Fuck this piece of shit game.
[150:09.06]This game sucks.
[150:10.66]This game is a fucking pile of fucking garbage.
[150:14.52]Send it back to the fucking drawing board.
[150:19.57]Okay.
[150:21.23]I knew it was coming eventually.
[150:23.87]I'm kidding.
[150:24.29]I'm kidding.
[150:25.15]I'm just kidding.
[150:25.81]It's a joke, guys.
[150:32.32]Uh, no.
[150:33.18]The game's fine.
[150:34.38]I'm kidding.
[150:34.72]That was a joke.
[150:35.24]I'm just kidding.
[150:37.40]This game's fucking worse than E.T.
[150:46.33]Someone said, finally, Jarmo's back.
[150:48.73]Finally.
[150:49.11]No, no.
[150:49.85]That was a joke.
[150:50.29]It was a joke.
[150:51.21]This game is fun.
[150:52.39]I'm having a good time.
[150:53.38]Uh-huh.
[150:55.62]Tell me more.
[151:00.29]No, I'm having a good time.
[151:01.67]Why would I still be playing?
[151:03.04]I know.
[151:03.76]I'm just messing with you.
[151:04.76]Because I knew it was coming.
[151:08.70]Fucking PUBG.
[151:09.92]Why don't you say thank you to PapaJohn6969?
[151:12.04]Hey, why doesn't somebody make a different game besides one of these games?
[151:18.85]Why don't we all climb aboard the fucking bandwagon and make like six of these?
[151:24.03]Here's your mistake.
[151:25.20]You should have played with MLC_St3alth and then he could carry you.
[151:29.80]That's where you messed up.
[151:31.86]Why don't we have the same game come out fucking four times in two years?
[151:37.71]Maybe we should do that.
[151:49.20]Now I have bingo.
[151:51.42]Somebody got bingo?
[151:59.11]No, I'm kidding.
[151:59.77]Guys, I'm just kidding.
[152:01.85]This game is like interesting.
[152:03.37]It's cool.
[152:03.75]It's probably the best one that exists right now.
[152:07.17]And I don't know that because I've only played this one.
[152:10.11]I played H1Z1 for like an hour and 12 minutes.
[152:14.26]I played DayZ for 45 minutes.
[152:16.12]I ran a straight line for 45 minutes and uninstalled the game.
[152:18.60]No, that's actually not being fair to... You put an effort in, DayZ.
[152:22.28]You were there for at least a couple of days.
[152:23.84]No, no, no.
[152:24.48]I ran for 45 minutes through a forest and I uninstalled the game.
[152:27.58]No, that was Life is Feudal.
[152:34.50]It's a different game.
[152:36.78]Different forest, different game.
[152:38.30]Life is futile.
[152:41.44]Yeah.
[152:43.30]Remember that one?
[152:44.08]It was like, whoa, this game's like 25 frames per second.
[152:47.66]I'm out.
[152:48.40]No, that was Life is Futile.
[152:50.50]Wow, that game sucked.
[152:53.94]We can go to the same place.
[152:55.88]Okay.
[152:57.22]I hope you guys are having fun.
[152:58.69]We're having fun here.
[153:03.00]We're just having a good time.
[153:03.88]Not a big deal.
[153:04.35]I'm pretty sure DayZ... By the way, jump now.
[153:08.09]I'm pretty sure, DayZ, you played a couple of different days.
[153:12.59]Like, I think you played it for at least four hours.
[153:15.37]Maybe.
[153:15.75]I don't know.
[153:16.55]Am I misremembering that?
[153:18.59]I don't remember playing, DayZ.
[153:19.87]You know, Rust... Rust was another 45-minute game, I think.
[153:26.62]Well, but here's the thing.
[153:27.24]Rust was funny because we could throw spears at each other.
[153:29.64]That's true.
[153:30.78]And you could throw rocks at people.
[153:32.30]That was funny.
[153:38.71]I'm not trying to rain on anybody's parade.
[153:41.21]This game's very popular for a reason.
[153:43.63]Because it's fun.
[153:44.41]You get into rounds quickly.
[153:47.01]It's engaging.
[153:48.27]The game came out four times in two years.
[153:50.99]It's great.
[153:51.93]It's a lot of fun.
[153:55.91]Alright, where are you landing?
[153:57.21]I'm going into this little, like, garage over here.
[153:59.70]Hoping that something's here.
[154:04.20]That was odd, but okay.
[154:06.48]I'm just gonna run to you, and we can at least die together.
[154:09.26]There's nothing in here.
[154:10.74]Great.
[154:16.05]Oh, I'm such a sitting duck.
[154:17.03]I might as well just stand in the fucking bush.
[154:19.39]You're actually pretty far away from the action.
[154:21.45]I am?
[154:22.66]Yeah.
[154:23.24]Those big apartment buildings is where all the actual loot is.
[154:25.66]Oh, okay.
[154:28.62]The one that you, uh, kept shooting the guy on the stairs.
[154:32.25]I seriously think this is gonna be successful, though.
[154:37.25]Okay, I'm good.
[154:40.35]Hi, do you have anything?
[154:41.65]No.
[154:43.63]Nothing in there.
[154:44.05]Because all the things are, uh, over there.
[154:47.86]Oh.
[154:49.54]We could try running back this way.
[154:50.80]I have no idea what to expect.
[154:53.10]There it is.
[154:53.90]There it is.
[154:54.74]What?
[154:56.68]Me saying that, like, fuck this dumb game.
[154:59.44]Oh.
[154:59.88]I don't actually believe that, guys.
[155:01.34]Didn't I tell you on stream, like, a few days ago that, like, 90% of everything I've ever said on stream is not true?
[155:07.18]And then we have, like, 10% of actual real talk?
[155:11.18]There's a guy on the roof to the right.
[155:13.26]Dodge and weave.
[155:17.70]Inside the control tower?
[155:20.99]Hey, look, this place is familiar.
[155:22.35]Mm-hmm.
[155:25.11]And this is where the bad guys were last time.
[155:28.23]There were bad guys here, you're right.
[155:30.37]Well, I don't even know what I just dropped, but there was, like, this thing on the ground.
[155:32.31]Do we both have pistols?
[155:32.95]We do.
[155:33.13]Good.
[155:34.92]Great.
[155:36.74]Good, great, grand, wonderful.
[155:37.52]This is very close.
[155:39.82]Southeast side.
[155:44.52]And, again, that's what the compass at the top is good for.
[155:47.22]Mm-hmm.
[155:54.88]Alright, I'm outside, just kind of being dumb.
[155:57.68]Just being dumb?
[155:59.40]God damn it!
[156:01.38]I'm just gonna... Fucking God.
[156:14.96]There was no noise.
[156:16.02]Did anybody hear anything?
[156:17.86]Did they run at you, or did you run at them?
[156:19.70]No, that person was standing still.
[156:21.60]There was no noise, and then they, like, peeked around the corner, and I died.
[156:28.29]Alright, so what we need to do is adjust your landing zone.
[156:31.65]That's kind of where the hiccup is.
[156:43.43]I'm shaking.
[156:43.97]I am too.
[156:44.35]I'm following you.
[156:46.55]And you have a tendency of landing away from the loot.
[156:52.69]How sweaty am I right now?
[156:53.94]I don't know, who knows.
[156:55.08]I- my pit- my- both of my pits are sweaty.
[156:56.84]This is the first and last time you're gonna see me play this game on stream, though.
[156:59.66]I can garin' fuckin' tell you that.
[157:10.54]This is like- this is like a top five game on Twitch right now.
[157:13.41]It should be a bottom five.
[157:17.87]And put like fuckin'- replace this game with Luigi's Mansion.
[157:21.17]Anything.
[157:26.04]Luigi's Mansion should be number five.
[157:34.03]Just hide in a bush, wait till everyone's dead, and then kill Etalyx, and I'll win.
[157:40.31]Is this the 10%?
[157:40.68]I don't know.
[157:53.98]I better play Luigi's.
[157:55.24]No, we're not like Luigi's Mansion.
[157:56.66]What are you talking about?
[157:57.24]We're not playing that.
[157:58.22]That game's not good.
[158:02.96]Luigi's Mansion is a game you can't lose.
[158:04.58]I like competitive games where there's so much shit on the line.
[158:10.67]You know what I mean?
[158:11.29]That's the kind of game I play.
[158:19.35]That was part of the 90% guys.
[158:22.86]We have not done any 10% talk right now.
[158:25.28]None.
[158:28.25]Luigi's Mansion is a fucking 10 out of 10 game.
[158:30.77]What do you guys think?
[158:31.79]I'm crazy?
[158:33.23]No.
[158:33.69]What?
[158:42.88]I mean, the movies is the best game that's ever been made.
[158:45.86]But besides that, Luigi's Mansion is a very close second.
[158:57.07]I'm just fucking kidding, man.
[159:05.97]Alright, let's be good this time.
[159:07.87]Let's try to play the game.
[159:09.72]I say that every time and then I do something stupid.
[159:11.56]We say that every time.
[159:15.70]What is with me with playing games on stream that require you to play the game for 20 hours before you should stream it?
[159:22.84]I don't know why I do this.
[159:24.84]Every other game I've played.
[159:37.27]Well, I've had fun.
[159:39.57]No, I have a ton.
[159:40.41]I've had fun, too.
[159:41.03]Alright.
[159:41.37]Are we all the way to the north?
[159:43.77]Well, I thought we were going to fly that way, but we're not, so... Which way?
[159:48.37]What do you want to do?
[159:48.89]Since we've had... Well, do you want to... What do you want to do is what I'm trying to say.
[159:53.48]Let's just go to the school.
[159:55.52]No.
[159:56.58]Three, two, one.
[159:57.92]You want to?
[159:59.16]Okay.
[160:00.12]Whatever.
[160:01.28]Whatever.
[160:03.38]I was told let's play for real.
[160:06.30]And we are.
[160:06.66]Because I'm putting on my pants right now.
[160:11.00]Okay, so where I am going to land is on the back left, like the front left, closest to us, of the school, like that door.
[160:21.89]Not the building on the right.
[160:23.11]You're talking about the back left portion of the big building.
[160:27.29]Yes, the back portion of the big building.
[160:29.65]Okay.
[160:29.85]Because everyone else is going to land on the roof.
[160:35.71]And we're going to run in the gym and hopefully find a stupid gun.
[160:40.61]So going into the gymnasium.
[160:42.65]Yeah.
[160:44.07]Okay.
[160:44.45]Going so slow.
[160:47.30]Did you say... You said the back portion of the... That is the right.
[160:50.40]You were on the front right, but that's okay.
[160:52.46]That's fine.
[160:57.68]Don't know which one of us is going to die first.
[160:59.74]I'm probably going to die first because I'm running the other way.
[161:01.71]Maybe not.
[161:10.31]Christ.
[161:12.05]There's a lot of shit right here.
[161:13.13]Oh my god, there's so many things.
[161:14.00]There's too many things I can't even pick anything up.
[161:21.36]Just reload something.
[161:30.36]There's so much stuff in here, Etalyx.
[161:33.02]Not now, Midas.
[161:33.59]Give me the Uzi.
[161:37.93]I got one.
[161:49.90]Not Al Midas.
[161:50.28]I'm so scared to go up these stairs.
[162:05.33]Very important.
[162:12.51]Are you upstairs?
[162:13.55]Yep.
[162:14.73]Okay, I'm coming to you.
[162:15.79]There's still people above me.
[162:23.74]I'm, like, right... I'm one, like, floor above you.
[162:27.71]Stay alive a little longer.
[162:29.37]There's someone moving above me, and you're above me and not moving.
[162:44.26]Somebody's, like, gonna be, like, right here.
[162:47.85]Somebody, like, right here.
[162:52.73]He's above you.
[162:53.83]Yeah.
[163:03.58]Okay.
[163:03.82]So what I'm going to do is run to the opposite side.
[163:13.94]Here, come to me.
[163:14.90]We gotta kill this guy.
[163:15.72]We can't keep looting with him here.
[163:17.26]We either die or we have to either win or die.
[163:19.80]Win long enough to see you.
[163:21.32]I'm going up the other stairs to try to spook him.
[163:24.65]Okay.
[163:26.07]Either win long enough before... I'm dead.
[163:29.03]He was literally sitting right... I'm actually not dead, but... Vitalik, come back here.
[163:33.05]I'm dead.
[163:33.29]Okay, good to you.
[163:35.24]I peaked the corner and instantly died.
[163:36.96]Wait, you ran up the stairs I said were not running up?
[163:39.52]Is that what happened?
[163:40.64]I peaked my face over and instantly died.
[163:42.84]You know what this game reminds me of?
[163:43.99]It's why I can't play it.
[163:44.97]It's fucking Rainbow Six Siege.
[163:48.07]It reminds you of Rainbow Six?
[163:49.29]This is just Rainbow Six Siege, but just like a little bit bigger.
[163:53.89]Where everyone just sits fucking still.
[164:02.18]This is just Rainbow Six Siege again, but a little bit bigger.
[164:04.96]This is not a genre that I want to play.
[164:17.01]I just want to remember chat.
[164:19.88]Did I say what I think I said?
[164:23.04]I'm trying my best to help you avoid the rage.
[164:25.36]Everybody runs around in circles and then people just sit in the fucking same spot and wait for voting people to walk around.
[164:46.92]You told me you were going to go upstairs and smoke him out, so I thought you were running around.
[164:51.06]I said not this stairs, the other stairs on the other side.
[164:53.71]You said the other side, and I said yes.
[164:55.13]Yeah, well, I thought we were going to sandwich the guy.
[164:59.63]Well, I assumed he was camping at the top of the stairs, which is why I was going to run to the other stairs.
[165:04.63]Well, why didn't you say he's camping at the top of the stairs?
[165:06.89]Because I didn't know for sure.
[165:07.79]I just guessed.
[165:09.67]I think I guessed right.
[165:10.69]Where's our communication?
[165:14.61]Okay, I killed a friend.
[165:17.77]I killed his buddy.
[165:18.45]Alright, we're gonna do calm.
[165:21.65]We're gonna do drive around and pick up items for 30 minutes.
[165:25.39]And then go find the last, like, 20 people that are sitting in a corner.
[165:28.79]Welcome to the fucking game.
[165:32.74]So there's two games here.
[165:33.64]There's drop down where everybody is and maybe instantly die, or go pick up shit for 30 minutes and then go find the fucking 15 people sitting in a corner.
[165:44.33]Back to the fucking drawing board.
[165:46.24]I actually... You reminded of Rainbow Six.
[165:48.52]I'm reminded of when we played Battlefield 1.
[165:52.10]I don't... This game... I don't hate this game.
[165:54.66]That's what you said about Battlefield 1, too.
[165:56.36]Well, I don't like Battlefield 1.
[165:58.45]No, that's not what you said.
[165:59.47]What did I say?
[165:59.77]You said the same thing.
[166:00.71]You said, this is a good game.
[166:02.47]I can see why people like it.
[166:05.03]But people just sit in corners and wait.
[166:08.51]And then meanwhile, me, Stealth, and Boo are having a big old good time of fun.
[166:16.94]I don't got time for this shit.
[166:17.76]I gotta move.
[166:18.24]You know what I mean?
[166:18.68]I gotta move.
[166:22.78]I can't sit around.
[166:24.94]I gotta go.
[166:27.62]I have to go.
[166:28.26]I can't just sit around.
[166:29.34]Where are we going, by the way?
[166:32.20]We're gonna just sit on the plane.
[166:33.74]No, we're gonna go to Primorsk, to the bottom left.
[166:36.13]What happens if you do sit on the plane?
[166:37.51]Does anything happen?
[166:38.45]They auto-kick you out.
[166:39.41]Alright, so we're doing it.
[166:44.71]Okay.
[166:46.55]We're going to the town on the corner.
[166:57.41]Cod guy?
[166:57.97]No, I'm not a cod guy either.
[166:58.99]I'm not even like a shooter guy anymore.
[167:02.22]I haven't, like, played shooters and, like... You can leave the shooters, but the shooters can't leave you.
[167:06.96]I'm, like, a fucking FMV gamer now.
[167:12.01]FMV gamer.
[167:13.35]I like playing, like... Which reminds me.
[167:15.43]Why haven't you played the FMV game that just came out?
[167:18.79]The one where you, like, have to type things at the British guy?
[167:23.06]What?
[167:23.96]Yeah, you, like, type... You ask questions to the, like, psychiatric patients.
[167:29.26]I didn't see this.
[167:29.62]You have to, like, guess the right questions.
[167:32.25]You don't know what I'm talking about?
[167:33.53]No, I have to take a look.
[167:37.69]Alright, I'm going to one of these yellow houses.
[167:43.46]Or I'm not.
[167:47.58]Oh, there's people everywhere.
[167:53.08]What?
[167:53.66]What's going on here?
[167:54.20]Somebody's in a car?
[167:57.76]Already.
[167:59.19]Somebody's in a vehicle already.
[168:01.74]Uh, they're coming towards us.
[168:04.22]So if you don't have a gun, then you might want to be careful, because they're probably going to go in your house.
[168:11.25]Are they here now?
[168:14.07]Uh, they might have just been meeting up with their friend.
[168:16.05]I don't know.
[168:16.97]Why don't you ask them?
[168:18.55]Should I go over voice chat and ask?
[168:19.61]You could.
[168:22.34]I have a good sight on here.
[168:24.22]Let me know how that goes.
[168:24.98]Okay, I have an Uzi, too.
[168:27.74]Shit, are you right here?
[168:29.14]Nope, I'm not with you.
[168:29.88]Oh, fuck.
[168:31.48]Do you hear footsteps?
[168:32.86]Yeah.
[168:34.70]Yeah.
[168:42.28]Come to me.
[168:45.06]Come to me, my child.
[168:48.26]Not be afraid.
[168:52.23]Come on.
[168:52.91]You can do it.
[168:55.87]One earbud footsteps, I know.
[168:58.67]Yeah, that's where the main source of the problems are coming from.
[169:02.11]But I can't have the volume up too loud, because it'll blow out everybody's ears on the stream.
[169:08.16]That's why you gotta manipulate stream volume and your volume independently.
[169:11.90]When a game is too loud, I can't even hear myself think, and I can't even talk.
[169:17.04]Anybody else like that?
[169:17.70]If a game is too loud in your ears, you can't speak to anybody?
[169:21.25]I have to hear myself fucking talk.
[169:31.52]All I see are pistols.
[169:34.25]Here, keep running to me.
[169:35.45]Just stay away from the fighting for now.
[169:40.25]Unless you think you got it.
[169:42.87]Does he got it?
[169:46.56]At least a few people said that they agree with me.
[169:48.94]So that's all I care about.
[169:50.02]About what?
[169:51.40]Like, if the game is too loud that you can't, like, function.
[170:04.66]I'm gonna be the baddie that dies first this time, okay?
[170:06.60]Are you sure about that?
[170:07.84]You sure about that?
[170:13.54]Because I can't get over the ledge.
[170:15.48]Like, are you sure that's gonna happen to Tal?
[170:17.16]Because I cannot... I'm a fucking, like... I'm a dog.
[170:19.48]Okay, you move forward, then jump.
[170:22.02]Yeah, I did that.
[170:25.08]There's somewhere, like, within 50 feet.
[170:28.92]I don't want to do the sit in the house thing, because that's how we always die, so let's...
[170:34.42]Get out and move.
[170:36.72]Gotta be a brave boy.
[170:47.09]You think they'll ever make a game like this where if you stand still for more than, like, 30 seconds, you catch fire?
[170:52.47]You just get auto-kicked from the game?
[170:54.01]Like, if you stand on the same, like, 10 feet?
[170:56.57]Okay, player, he can't see me.
[170:58.73]He's east.
[170:59.95]He's probably, like, 50 feet away.
[171:01.21]Let's just go in this house and then...
[171:06.13]Try to find a window or something, looking out.
[171:07.99]There's a good gun in here if you need it.
[171:10.31]In that closet.
[171:11.69]Closet, huh?
[171:12.23]There's bandage in there, too.
[171:14.97]This room.
[171:18.91]Good gun.
[171:21.47]I mean, that is... I have an AK.
[171:26.68]I want to keep the AK.
[171:27.30]Are these bullets for the... I don't even... Whatever.
[171:34.70]Painkillers.
[171:37.40]What's better, the AK or the M16?
[171:39.80]I like the M16 stuff, personally.
[171:42.71]It's easier to aim down sights.
[171:44.21]I want to take the fucking... Can I take the scope off this thing?
[171:47.59]Yeah.
[171:47.91]Take the scope off, then drop the gun, and then put it on the new one.
[171:51.77]Okay.
[171:58.88]See, like right now, you and I should be on fire.
[172:00.52]I should be like... I'm moving.
[172:03.36]I'm moving.
[172:03.98]I should be on fire.
[172:06.27]spontaneously combust.
[172:08.56]I'm pretty sure he's around or in this yellow building.
[172:11.84]That is east of us.
[172:17.14]Oh, he's somewhere in that vicinity.
[172:18.92]Replace the Uzi?
[172:19.76]Won't I be overburdened if I replace the Uzi?
[172:21.18]Okay.
[172:34.15]I'm about to just charge out there.
[172:36.50]Careful.
[172:36.90]You ready?
[172:37.46]I'm going to draw their aim.
[172:38.12]I'm ready.
[172:38.58]And you just give me covering fire.
[172:40.34]Just kidding.
[172:42.97]Nobody even here.
[172:47.85]Helmet.
[172:48.09]Do you have armor?
[172:51.59]I do not have armor.
[172:53.89]On the table.
[173:01.10]Okay.
[173:01.54]I'm going to move up.
[173:07.81]I'm a strong boy.
[173:08.69]I can carry it.
[173:16.82]I am a strong boy.
[173:18.88]Sometimes.
[173:19.80]Okay, be careful here.
[173:27.94]Could be in this house still.
[173:30.16]Where did you see him?
[173:32.06]This yellow house is the last place I saw him.
[173:35.88]Hmm.
[173:36.48]But I'm just gonna go get in the car and go.
[173:38.88]Yeah.
[173:39.06]Alright, we're in.
[173:54.27]Mmm... I don't see anyone.
[173:55.43]Because we gotta go a little ways to get inside the circle.
[174:03.01]Jeremy's so bored right now.
[174:04.25]No, I'm not.
[174:07.25]I'm not bored right now.
[174:09.70]Oh, I'm going to make sure of that.
[174:14.94]This is PUBG.
[174:15.64]This is just how it is.
[174:16.38]It's kind of as exciting as you make it.
[174:26.73]Like, for example, if I thought, hey, maybe there's someone here.
[174:30.55]Maybe I just drive in the middle of all of them.
[174:33.49]But then now we're in trouble because you ran over the fence.
[174:36.51]Now we're in trouble.
[174:39.81]Like this guy right there.
[174:42.07]I can't aim down that.
[174:42.89]Get out.
[174:43.29]Get out.
[174:45.43]Oh, there's another guy here.
[174:48.29]Two guys.
[174:50.83]Wait, are you shooting?
[174:52.95]I can't.
[174:56.18]I did that.
[174:58.88]Like I would have maybe killed somebody.
[175:01.70]Then it's more exciting.
[175:03.76]It's just like two.
[175:05.80]I shouldn't have done that.
[175:06.90]I knew not to do it, but I shouldn't have done it.
[175:11.72]How many people were there?
[175:12.38]Three?
[175:14.32]No, there was two.
[175:17.58]Did you get to shoot at anybody?
[175:18.71]I shot... My gun... I shot like... I hit the guy like three times and then I died.
[175:21.55]I bet I wish I had the AK.
[175:24.51]I kind of do.
[175:25.13]Because that burst fire was not helping me.
[175:29.71]Did Alex kill you?
[175:30.45]This is my... This is my last game in Battlegrounds.
[175:32.96]Okay, this is the real one then.
[175:34.26]This is the real one.
[175:37.08]I'm sorry.
[175:37.54]I should not have goofed.
[175:39.04]I wanted to prove a point.
[175:40.87]Did you prove... Well, your point was pretty proven.
[175:42.95]It was we drove in a straight line for like five minutes and then we instantly died.
[175:46.83]Five minutes?
[175:47.89]We were on that road for fucking like 30 minutes.
[175:49.63]That was 30 seconds.
[175:51.02]Like, we were on that road for at least like 12 to 40 minutes.
[175:59.78]It's exciting as you make it.
[176:01.57]You just go in and people are there.
[176:13.29]Time to win with pure frustration.
[176:15.08]Oh, by the way, let me say thank you to some people.
[176:20.20]Matters of Darkness, thank you for the five bucks.
[176:21.74]What about a mob that replaces all the player models in PUBG with Luigi?
[176:26.16]I would love that game.
[176:28.76]Thank you, Shagums, for the 15 bucks.
[176:31.01]Didn't say anything, but thank you for the $15 nonetheless.
[176:35.01]Tuskor, thank you for the bits.
[176:35.99]Hey, Jerma, just got my first paycheck and wanted to give a little something back for the years of laughs you give me.
[176:40.21]Thanks for all the laughs.
[176:41.41]Never change who you are.
[176:42.21]Well, thank you, Tuskor.
[176:44.68]Uh, thank you to Gatman for the bits.
[176:47.97]Also, GoldenGuy.
[176:49.81]Crodon.
[176:50.63]StixRenegade.
[176:51.49]StixRenegade says, The bet is still on.
[176:52.97]Get number one anytime during this stream.
[176:55.67]I'm not gonna get number one.
[176:56.61]This is not gonna happen.
[176:58.81]StixRenegade, again, thanks for ten bucks.
[177:01.73]Uh, StixRenegade said, If we get number one, he'll donate a hundred dollars.
[177:05.98]So, I mean, the pressure's on right now.
[177:09.66]Also, thank you, KW... KSync for the five bucks.
[177:13.42]And...
[177:14.96]Thanks a lot, guys.
[177:16.54]You guys are great, great, great.
[177:17.91]And Diabeetles right now just gave $5.
[177:19.89]Hey, friend, how is you?
[177:20.87]I'm good.
[177:23.53]Thank you.
[177:25.71]I will, too.
[177:27.61]Etalyx, I might... Okay, there's like eight people that are going to match $100 if we get to first place.
[177:34.54]If we get first place.
[177:35.70]We have to get first place, Etalyx.
[177:36.84]I'm about to make $1,000.
[177:37.50]That's going to be a really boring game to watch.
[177:42.77]Alright.
[177:42.97]We're going to Malta, I guess.
[177:45.46]Right there in the town.
[177:46.68]Three, two, one.
[177:48.24]Go north.
[177:51.60]Town just to the north.
[177:52.72]Here comes the thousands all around.
[177:53.50]We need to stick together.
[177:54.28]But not like in the same house, but in neighboring houses so we can like help each other.
[177:58.00]Alright.
[177:58.26]So just somewhere in this town?
[177:59.19]Just land in the town somewhere?
[178:01.51]Yeah.
[178:02.17]Typically not the middle.
[178:03.31]We don't really want to go middle.
[178:05.63]Get number one with three plus kills and I will donate two.
[178:08.55]Two story houses are better.
[178:09.65]Alright.
[178:12.68]so like this little edge by the water here I'm gonna die in like 10 seconds somebody oh god somebody just gave a hundred dollars and says good luck wager thank you for the hundred dollars hey nobody's landing around us I don't see another parachute that's weird but we should if somebody sneaks up on you now then it's a hacker okay
[178:37.34]You want to be first place?
[178:38.38]Boom.
[178:38.60]We got the whole town.
[178:39.58]Wager just gave $100.
[178:41.64]I've got to get number one.
[178:43.79]If you don't get number one, you have to give it back.
[178:46.77]You get this house.
[178:47.35]We're going to be as careful as humanly possible.
[178:49.97]As we possibly can.
[178:51.27]This is the last one.
[178:52.11]I'm not dying.
[178:53.93]If I die, that's going to be very bad.
[178:55.39]You're supposed to loot that house.
[178:56.41]Stop following me.
[178:57.17]I'm very focused.
[179:01.29]I can't even think.
[179:02.25]I'm picking the red house.
[179:04.65]The barn.
[179:06.68]Pick one that's close.
[179:07.90]I just did.
[179:08.68]I already got a gun.
[179:10.04]Okay.
[179:10.90]I was told we were trying very hard.
[179:13.77]I am.
[179:14.47]Trust me.
[179:16.97]Okay.
[179:17.75]You went a little too far away from me.
[179:18.89]I don't like that.
[179:19.35]It's okay.
[179:20.31]That's why I said nobody landed around us.
[179:22.19]It has to be me and you as the final two, and then I have to shoot you in the head.
[179:27.35]Because... No.
[179:29.49]That's how we're doing it.
[179:31.25]There's no other people here, you said?
[179:33.17]this I did not see a single other person land here so watch me open the door and just instantly die yes thank you you're standing right on you're crowding me you're cramping my style well I'm sorry how come you have why are you like decked out in military gear and I'm like ready to go to work because I just looted the house you ran in behind me to loot
[179:56.01]Why do I look like a shitty Slytherin?
[179:59.11]I've got a nice work tie on myself.
[180:01.71]I'm just ready to go to work and get shot at as I go.
[180:05.73]Well, it's going to be alright.
[180:06.84]We're going to get in first place, and then I'm going to make $1,000.
[180:08.80]Alright, you go to any of these houses.
[180:11.26]Alright, I'm going on this one.
[180:13.38]I'm going to be across the street, honey.
[180:16.24]Just text me if you need me.
[180:17.32]I just wanted to show you guys a couple of tricks.
[180:20.00]There you go.
[180:20.38]I just showed you two tricks.
[180:25.94]What do we got?
[180:27.70]Nothing?
[180:31.22]Body armor?
[180:32.04]No?
[180:32.74]Maybe?
[180:33.52]Backpack?
[180:35.26]Cheek pad?
[180:35.94]What the fuck is a cheek pad?
[180:38.67]It's for sniper rifles.
[180:39.99]Oh, I thought it meant like it was going to put armor on my face.
[180:42.05]Yeah.
[180:42.73]Butt armor.
[180:43.79]Oh, why?
[180:44.01]Because your face looks like your butt?
[180:45.99]That's not even... That was not even funny and I resent you.
[180:50.05]Is there upstairs here?
[180:52.03]There is.
[180:53.03]Let's go.
[180:58.74]Gas, I don't want that.
[181:03.61]Energy drink.
[181:06.27]Revolver or pistol?
[181:07.17]Which one is more reliable?
[181:08.81]Pistol.
[181:09.67]Okay.
[181:10.47]Never pick revolver.
[181:11.63]Literally never pick up revolver?
[181:13.43]Unless you absolutely have to.
[181:15.45]Okay.
[181:16.03]So I should throw the revolver in the trash.
[181:18.25]Yeah.
[181:19.03]I wouldn't take the pistol either.
[181:21.13]What do you mean?
[181:22.15]That's all I have.
[181:22.73]I'll take it, but I wouldn't feel good about it.
[181:26.09]There's nothing else in these houses.
[181:30.00]We just haven't found the right house yet.
[181:31.20]You got to keep looking.
[181:32.89]Well, it's okay.
[181:33.53]Alright, I'm coming back down.
[181:38.21]So you're saying we have this whole area to ourselves?
[181:40.79]For now, yeah, but we are on the edge of the circle, so if anybody is east of us, they're going to be running into us.
[181:46.83]Did you check any of these?
[181:47.59]You didn't check any of these, right?
[181:49.83]The door is closed, and I probably didn't check.
[181:56.73]Why are they just only pistols?
[182:01.84]Oh, here we go.
[182:02.84]Okay.
[182:03.14]Alright.
[182:03.44]Alright.
[182:03.74]This is... We win.
[182:05.50]This is my cheek pad.
[182:08.42]Etalyx, I have a sniper rifle now.
[182:11.84]It's got 75 bullets.
[182:14.74]Sniper rifle?
[182:16.09]75 bullets in the sniper rifle.
[182:19.79]What kind of... What gun is it?
[182:21.63]I don't know.
[182:22.53]It is a... What's the name of it?
[182:24.23]The VSS.
[182:24.73]The VSS.
[182:27.80]Okay, that kind of sucks.
[182:29.30]What?
[182:29.54]I mean, it's good because it has a silencer on it, so at least you won't give away your position.
[182:35.63]Hold on.
[182:36.59]So how do I zoom in?
[182:37.59]Is there a way to zoom in?
[182:39.53]Do you know how to tap right-click?
[182:41.97]I know, but can I go further out back?
[182:44.27]How does it work?
[182:45.01]That is a 4x scope.
[182:46.57]That's all it is.
[182:48.68]Okay.
[182:48.92]Alright, so what do we...
[182:55.35]You're kind of in the middle of the road.
[182:57.07]Just letting you know.
[182:57.67]Yeah, but there's nobody here.
[182:58.39]Yeah, well, you don't know that.
[183:02.45]There's explosions.
[183:03.07]What is that?
[183:04.97]Artillery.
[183:06.59]Oh, shit.
[183:07.13]Okay, this place is getting bombed.
[183:09.31]We're on the edge.
[183:10.05]We're not going to get hit.
[183:11.89]Don't say that.
[183:13.67]We're not.
[183:14.37]Trust me.
[183:18.23]I need to find a place to snipe so I can get to number one.
[183:21.04]Do you have armor?
[183:23.76]I do not have any armor, no.
[183:25.00]Okay, so that's like our number one goal right now is to get you armor.
[183:28.37]Here's a level two helmet.
[183:29.31]Boom.
[183:30.01]Right there.
[183:30.45]I mean, I have a helmet.
[183:31.93]No, this is level two.
[183:32.85]You have a motorcycle helmet.
[183:36.49]I have 235 shots.
[183:39.09]Why is it 235?
[183:40.27]You know why?
[183:40.75]Because that sniper rifle shoots 9mm ammunition, which is pistol ammunition.
[183:45.85]What?
[183:47.19]You are going to have to hit someone four or five times for them to get killed.
[183:50.35]Why would you make a sniper rifle ever that shoots pistol ammo?
[183:55.95]It's a real rifle.
[183:56.87]I mean, because in real life, getting hit with bullets still kills you.
[184:01.99]But here's a level 2 armor vest, just for you.
[184:04.29]Just for me.
[184:04.77]Yep.
[184:07.56]Okay.
[184:08.46]I've done everything I can.
[184:09.60]From this point, I can't do nothing more.
[184:10.96]From this point on, you can't do anything else.
[184:12.82]So I've got to find me a roof.
[184:16.56]And I'm going to sit there for the whole game.
[184:18.90]Yep.
[184:22.30]The whole game.
[184:22.72]And I'm going to guess number one.
[184:27.20]And I'm going to be like, rolling in dough.
[184:30.40]I'm going to bankroll so much money.
[184:32.32]I'm going to be number one.
[184:33.38]It's going to be like, that's just the fucking hundreds coming up.
[184:39.71]Alright, here we go.
[184:49.11]Perfect.
[184:52.34]He's going to chill right there.
[184:54.42]You might want to, like, you know, do a thing where you just crouch and make yourself low profile.
[185:03.91]Now I'm ready.
[185:05.63]We're outside the circle, so that's one reason why we're not ready.
[185:09.43]And the blue circle is going to be closing in on us soon and making us move forward.
[185:13.25]Okay, so I should stand up.
[185:14.71]Yeah.
[185:16.99]So what we're going to do now is hopefully not get sniped.
[185:20.82]There's no fall damage, right?
[185:21.88]You have to be pretty high.
[185:24.94]Like, I'd say third story there's fall damage.
[185:26.84]Second story, no.
[185:27.84]No, I didn't take fall damage.
[185:28.84]Should I do auto for this?
[185:31.58]For the sniper rifle?
[185:33.58]Probably, right?
[185:34.42]There's an auto mode?
[185:35.94]We're not around anybody, right?
[185:37.04]So I can just test this.
[185:37.98]I have 300 bullets.
[185:39.24]Listen, just to be clear.
[185:41.09]Okay.
[185:41.71]When you are shooting someone from close range, hold right click.
[185:44.95]Don't try to scope down.
[185:46.37]Okay, just making sure.
[185:48.93]Okay, so auto.
[185:52.62]Take out the Uzi for now.
[185:53.56]We don't have to do any long range nonsense.
[185:56.75]Okay.
[185:57.43]So how serious are we playing this?
[185:59.49]Serious.
[186:00.21]We have to get to at least the top.
[186:01.63]Doesn't matter if 30 minutes of nothing until we get killed?
[186:05.40]Doesn't matter.
[186:06.18]If we get to the top 20, I get $1,000.
[186:08.02]I'm just being permission to go to the boring zones.
[186:12.30]Yeah.
[186:13.92]I was told if I get to the top 30, then I get $1,000.
[186:15.80]Alright, we're going to switch.
[186:19.62]What do you mean?
[186:20.16]No.
[186:25.14]Fully automatic.
[186:27.81]So here's what's going to happen if I see someone ahead of us.
[186:30.08]I'm not going to drive into them like I would if I was trying to do a ha-ha funny moment.
[186:33.64]I'm going to pull off the road behind cover, and we're going to stop and engage or just keep running or keep driving.
[186:41.95]Are there going to be other people up here, you think?
[186:44.64]There could be.
[186:50.89]Yeah, I gotta get in a good position where I can do a snipe.
[186:54.59]I can do a snipe.
[186:55.51]Let me just say that with a brainless voice.
[186:58.59]Just do a snipe.
[186:59.49]I don't really know where to relax.
[187:07.68]I'm trying to snipe like this.
[187:11.88]I feel like if you look down the 4x scope while I'm driving like this, you would just get sick.
[187:15.34]Yeah, I kind of did for a second there.
[187:22.27]How do you play seriously with the least serious streamer in the world?
[187:24.63]I'm not the least serious streamer.
[187:26.01]There's like at least a couple dozen other streamers that are way more serious than me.
[187:34.80]Thought we were tipping.
[187:39.16]Players are here, I think.
[187:41.34]Maybe I can get a good snipe position here.
[187:43.11]We're going to stay clear.
[187:47.12]See?
[187:47.50]Being smart.
[187:48.02]With my 4x scope.
[187:49.52]Not just going straight in.
[187:51.16]Like, I really want to.
[187:52.58]You are the least serious to read that?
[187:54.04]No, I'm not.
[187:56.00]I've taken some things dead seriously before.
[187:58.06]Like, for instance, right now.
[187:59.16]We're not, like, fucking around.
[188:00.20]We're taking this, like, dead serious.
[188:01.96]Listen to the tone of my voice.
[188:02.84]It's changed.
[188:04.60]I'm not, like, goofing around or, like, fucking around.
[188:06.94]The tone of my voice is completely different.
[188:09.73]Listen to me.
[188:12.63]I'm, like, collected.
[188:13.17]I'm calm.
[188:13.37]I'm going to be perfectly honest with you.
[188:14.73]I don't know when to stop.
[188:18.43]Like, if I stop now, we're kind of like in the middle.
[188:22.36]We could be attacked from any side.
[188:23.74]If I go to the edge, then we have a lot more distance to close before the... If I go into one of these towns, there could be people just on the road that hear the car and come out and shoot us.
[188:32.75]I never know when to stop.
[188:33.51]Like, I get in the car, and then it's like, we're just driving.
[188:35.33]We're cruising.
[188:35.79]We're just driving.
[188:39.33]That looks like a car spawn.
[188:40.59]Let's look up here.
[188:41.23]Look up.
[188:44.02]We've got to loot some more stuff, I feel like.
[188:46.48]I want to see doors look open here.
[188:48.38]Yeah, there's an open door.
[188:49.41]Yeah, we've got an open door here.
[188:52.19]Okay, so moving on.
[188:54.05]Just change the tone of your voice with me.
[188:55.45]Just make it a little bit more serious, like this.
[188:58.47]Okay.
[188:58.97]Okay, so here's what we're going to do.
[189:00.57]What do you want to do?
[189:01.57]We're inside the white circle right now.
[189:03.91]And Puchinki up ahead is going to be a hot spot, so we're definitely going to clear that.
[189:08.01]And we're going to move west.
[189:09.06]Okay, you want to get me in the mountain?
[189:10.02]You want to get me in the mountain, and I'll aim down from the mountain and cover you with my four times?
[189:14.71]Okay.
[189:14.81]You want to go to the top of the mountain?
[189:15.96]Get us to the top of the mountain.
[189:16.94]I'm going to aim at the four signs.
[189:17.94]Alright.
[189:19.18]Going to the top.
[189:21.52]I'm going to elevator you right to the top.
[189:24.50]Okay.
[189:26.78]And then I want to, like, aim down on Puchinki.
[189:35.36]Are we staying here?
[189:36.15]Okay.
[189:38.25]So... Just watch over this little lip.
[189:42.07]Yeah.
[189:42.49]Might be a guy in here.
[189:45.52]Four times.
[189:46.16]I heard shots at 210 on your compass.
[189:50.86]So they could be coming up this hill, possibly?
[190:01.70]210.
[190:02.16]I wouldn't prone if I were you.
[190:03.50]Why?
[190:04.34]What I would do instead is just use third person to peek over lips without actually showing your head.
[190:10.49]And if you stay third person, you can, like, if you start getting shot at, you can...
[190:14.27]move out of the way faster you know like it's harder to get up from prone also blades of grass will get in your way really is that come on drop right now what is usually in those that's so valuable alright we need to move I don't like the spot
[190:37.17]Uh, what's in those?
[190:37.89]M249s.
[190:39.65]Um, I think the VSS, the sniper you have, can drop.
[190:42.57]Ooh.
[190:44.03]Um, there's, like, an M224 sniper rifle, I think.
[190:48.48]Get in there, you zazz.
[190:51.10]Alright, we're playing it boring.
[190:55.42]Playing it slow, playing it boring.
[190:56.84]We have to get to number one.
[191:01.00]Let's just go on a road trip until there's like six people left.
[191:06.65]That's what I... Oh, you mean just like... Well, we're going to run out of gas if we do that.
[191:10.59]Oh, well.
[191:12.39]Like gas is not an issue unless you do that.
[191:16.19]Is there a sniper rifle with like a 60 times scope in the game or something?
[191:20.33]I saw sensitivity options for 16 times.
[191:22.97]Oh, well.
[191:25.79]But I haven't actually seen one of those in the game.
[191:30.10]Alright, so here's what we're going to do.
[191:31.06]What are we doing?
[191:32.28]We're going to stop right here.
[191:35.16]And what I want you to do, since you've got... Is your sniper rifle only 4x scope, or is it 8x?
[191:40.22]It's 4x.
[191:41.62]Okay, well, just kind of like peek over the rocks with your scope.
[191:45.18]We're on a decent hill here.
[191:46.40]Just kind of see what you can see.
[191:47.88]Is that towards over here?
[191:49.26]Towards the south?
[191:50.47]Yeah, just towards the buildings.
[191:51.99]Just kind of all around.
[191:52.95]We're on a little bit of a crest.
[191:55.13]Okay.
[191:57.01]So I'll kind of watch behind.
[191:58.13]Yep.
[192:00.84]I don't see anybody over there.
[192:03.77]Nobody in that building.
[192:04.91]Oh, we got drivers.
[192:05.95]We got drivers.
[192:07.39]We got a car full of people.
[192:10.59]By the way, that gun has insane bullet drop.
[192:15.16]This gun is terrible.
[192:17.14]Okay, just hide behind the rock right now.
[192:18.88]Don't let the car... Does he know?
[192:21.80]This gun is bad.
[192:22.30]I don't know.
[192:23.00]This gun is bad.
[192:27.39]This is a bad gun.
[192:28.67]I think he saw you.
[192:29.71]No, he didn't.
[192:30.01]He definitely sees the car on the hill.
[192:31.31]Well, whatever.
[192:31.99]Let me... Should I stand up?
[192:33.65]I think you hit him.
[192:34.35]Take some shots.
[192:39.74]Probably not on full auto, though.
[192:48.90]You're getting blood on somebody.
[192:50.98]The guy in the car is...
[192:53.91]Is he dead?
[192:55.55]Have you not killed him yet?
[192:56.77]Hurry up.
[192:57.69]He's getting his friend out.
[192:59.03]Oh, you downed him!
[193:01.67]You killed a guy.
[193:02.34]Kill the other guy.
[193:05.06]It's like skipping rocks.
[193:08.46]You're almost there.
[193:09.38]How did I not kill the other guy?
[193:10.82]There's a car coming up on us from behind.
[193:13.74]Wait, how?
[193:15.05]What?
[193:15.29]Is this guy still alive?
[193:16.83]One guy's still alive.
[193:18.03]No, he's not.
[193:18.69]There's no way.
[193:19.77]Maybe they're both dead.
[193:21.35]If you killed one, the other guy's dead, I think.
[193:23.70]They're both dead.
[193:24.36]Okay, we win.
[193:26.82]What?
[193:27.32]It said I killed one person.
[193:29.32]Yeah.
[193:29.92]I think you would have killed both.
[193:32.12]I killed two people with one shot.
[193:33.40]I have one kill.
[193:35.88]So there were definitely two guys there, right?
[193:37.42]Yeah, there were two guys there I killed.
[193:38.44]I shot one bullet and they both died.
[193:39.95]Okay.
[193:40.39]Here, get in the car.
[193:42.31]We're gonna go look.
[193:43.47]Alright, let's go investigate.
[193:45.47]I gotta find the answer to this.
[193:46.55]Even if it gets me killed, I have to know.
[193:49.35]If there's another guy down there.
[193:51.83]I shot... Both of them fell over.
[193:59.86]Where did you kill them?
[194:00.86]They were right there.
[194:02.34]I shot them.
[194:03.90]So, like, where's the body?
[194:05.52]Okay, there's two boxes.
[194:06.56]There's two boxes, so why did I get one kill?
[194:08.50]You are very brave getting out of the car while it moves.
[194:10.64]Are you sure?
[194:10.94]That could have insta-downed you.
[194:11.90]Okay, are there any more, like, X-sites?
[194:16.06]I'm at level two.
[194:16.72]Alright, I'm gonna park this so it gives you a little cover.
[194:19.28]Okay.
[194:21.26]I mean, I don't... There's like a two-time scope in here.
[194:23.85]There's a red dot sight.
[194:24.93]I need that.
[194:25.79]There's an AK.
[194:26.71]I'm going to get the... Give me some shoes.
[194:33.11]A med kit.
[194:35.39]First aid.
[194:36.39]Painkillers.
[194:37.39]Eight-time scope.
[194:38.39]I can't use that shit.
[194:40.56]How many first aid do you have?
[194:44.48]One.
[194:45.74]Okay.
[194:46.16]Keep it.
[194:47.54]Why can't I put on the eight-time scope?
[194:50.22]uh vss is a fixed scope gun it's not interchangeable it's just built that way uh is there anything else we're about to get shelled in like probably 30 seconds by artillery let's get in their car and get look at it hey do you have an 8x uh yeah it's on the ground over here okay I see two it's out we gotta go oh there it is okay Etalyx I don't I don't want us to die where are we going
[195:19.25]Just drive out of the red to the right.
[195:20.99]Wait, I need the AK.
[195:27.25]Okay.
[195:28.29]Get the ammo and let's boogie.
[195:30.09]Go!
[195:30.25]Alright, so we both have snipers, so the smart thing to do here is to go up to a sniping spot.
[195:46.48]Okay.
[195:48.19]But I gotta do a better job of hiding the stupid buggy.
[195:54.01]VSS magazine.
[195:54.91]I don't need a VSS magazine.
[195:56.17]I have 264 volts.
[196:01.82]The bullet drop on this thing is outrageous, by the way.
[196:04.90]It's seriously like throwing a rock.
[196:08.24]Oh, yeah.
[196:08.80]That's because it's a 9mm.
[196:10.06]It has no velocity.
[196:11.53]I was aiming in the same spot and the bullets were going in completely different directions.
[196:15.31]It was impossible to aim at those guys.
[196:16.59]I don't know how I got killed, but I don't know how I did that.
[196:18.41]Alright, so no matter what happens, we got two kills on stream with the sniper.
[196:22.40]Yeah, we're good.
[196:23.58]So it was two kills on stream with the sniper rifle is a thousand dollars, right?
[196:26.66]Yeah.
[196:26.86]I think that's all it was, yeah.
[196:31.06]Alright, I kind of don't want to be in the very middle of the whole area.
[196:35.49]But we have snipers, so... So let's play smart.
[196:38.47]I don't know where I'm going.
[196:40.19]I do want to play smart.
[196:42.38]That was an extended mag.
[196:43.16]That car.
[196:43.34]Why is there a car right... Oh.
[196:44.64]I was... What?
[196:46.50]That's next to the airdrop.
[196:47.46]There's an airdrop next to that guy's... Whoa.
[196:49.72]Whoa.
[196:49.94]Where is he?
[196:50.86]Where is he?
[196:51.32]By the airdrop.
[196:52.04]15.
[196:52.74]15.
[196:53.06]The direction is 15.
[196:55.80]15.
[196:55.88]I'm just going to swerve.
[196:58.44]Alright.
[196:58.71]You're safe if you get out.
[196:59.53]15?
[196:59.55]Yeah.
[197:16.17]Yeah, north 15.
[197:17.11]He knows we're here, so don't peek.
[197:20.11]Seems like he has a good scope.
[197:21.73]But if you want to peek and you have a silencer, then good luck.
[197:30.52]I have just no idea where he is.
[197:33.02]Okay, so there's an airdrop.
[197:34.36]It's red.
[197:35.06]It's at 340 to 345 is the angle.
[197:37.69]He's next to a car.
[197:38.51]He could be pushing this house.
[197:45.56]Be surprised if he... Okay, I see him.
[197:49.36]He's moving 345.
[197:50.74]He's going up the hill.
[197:53.74]I got two hits.
[197:54.80]Two hits.
[197:57.03]Three.
[197:57.31]I don't see him.
[198:01.59]He's down.
[198:02.03]Someone else downed him at the top.
[198:04.35]I got four hits on him, and he still is alive.
[198:06.61]Up on the hill, you said?
[198:07.93]Look, 345.
[198:08.09]At the very top of the hill...
[198:14.76]There's a tree with, you can see my bullet markers.
[198:17.40]I have two little dots.
[198:19.66]Let me go to where you are.
[198:25.84]Oh, I see him.
[198:27.02]Where is he?
[198:28.94]Okay, so 345, the very tippy top, there's a tree, and he's just been peeking over the hill.
[198:33.50]There's a tree.
[198:35.86]I know, there's a lot of tree.
[198:36.92]I know there's a lot of trees, but it's difficult to describe which one.
[198:41.98]It's in between 345 and north.
[198:44.95]He wants to loot the body.
[198:47.31]I can almost see him.
[198:54.25]Hmm.
[198:54.67]I feel like we're going to get snuck up on by somebody.
[198:56.53]Yeah.
[198:57.59]But I know... Wait, wait.
[198:58.74]There he is.
[199:05.02]See, I wish I knew where the hell he even was.
[199:06.32]Wait for it.
[199:07.72]Is it... I hear footsteps.
[199:10.80]No, you don't.
[199:11.24]Yes, I do.
[199:13.02]I just... I swear to God, I just did.
[199:15.45]Well, there's no silent moving in this game, so he can't be, uh... Okay, there's two guys at the top of the hill north.
[199:31.15]I'm keeping them busy.
[199:31.83]They don't know where the shots are coming from.
[199:33.27]Regards to the car.
[199:34.21]Like, where are they to the car?
[199:35.90]Okay.
[199:36.30]So car, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, like eight trees right.
[199:43.04]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[199:44.18]Okay, look where I'm aiming.
[199:45.28]Do you see like where I'm looking in the general direction?
[199:47.84]Alright, I'm going to like line up with you.
[199:49.74]Yeah.
[199:52.20]They're like at the top of the hill that I'm looking at straight that way on the other side.
[200:00.39]And I'm scared to go out.
[200:01.51]Let's see.
[200:01.79]We're in the circle.
[200:03.09]So people are going to be coming to us.
[200:06.41]From the north.
[200:07.07]So where they are, they're probably going to come down.
[200:09.07]I see him.
[200:09.31]I see him.
[200:09.95]I see where he is now.
[200:19.14]Are you getting shot at?
[200:21.18]This gun is very hard.
[200:22.37]He's right there.
[200:23.23]He's right in between the trees at like that three, like 30-ish.
[200:25.69]Like three, like three, like 40.
[200:52.45]I lost them.
[200:52.99]I don't know where they are now.
[200:55.27]I think they're getting near the car.
[200:57.34]They're near the car on the left?
[200:58.52]I would assume.
[200:59.08]He was going down the hill over here to the left.
[201:02.74]Okay, well the blue is moving in.
[201:04.06]I'm pulling up the AK.
[201:09.24]Just be aware, we are currently in one of three housing locations inside the circle.
[201:17.35]Be aware that people are going to be running up on this house.
[201:19.71]That's what I'm saying.
[201:22.71]or or driving at it they took the car that was in front of the uh yeah I told you I was telling you there are 300 west in the car yep I should have been watching that I was telling you he was at the car I was just scared my bad I didn't know if it was with anybody else
[201:52.24]I'm like, I don't know, I'm exposed right there.
[201:54.56]By the way, both of us should be on fire.
[201:58.02]Yeah, well, we ain't.
[202:01.26]I'm going to go ahead and open these two doors just in case we want to run into them.
[202:05.66]Actually, this one has a window.
[202:09.72]This is a bad house.
[202:10.48]18, boys and girls, 18.
[202:13.94]His stupid pan blocked it.
[202:21.53]He's behind a tree, 330 to 345, pretty close to the house.
[202:25.05]Pretty close to the house.
[202:26.15]Don't open the door.
[202:27.71]Use the window.
[202:40.16]I think he's behind the... We're going to have to move in too, but we have 52 seconds.
[202:54.55]Three, like, 30, you said?
[202:55.63]One dead.
[202:55.99]Nice.
[202:58.56]Look, he's in plain view.
[202:59.88]Just look through the window.
[203:00.64]He's running up the hill.
[203:02.24]330, 345 towards the shed.
[203:04.66]He's hiding inside of the shed with the red tin roof.
[203:07.30]I killed his partner.
[203:08.26]Okay, he's hiding inside that.
[203:10.06]Yeah, he's hiding inside the tin roof shed.
[203:12.48]He's going to have to move here in a second, isn't he?
[203:15.42]He's, like, in the blue.
[203:17.20]Yeah, well, we're going to have to move, too.
[203:18.80]So just keep that in mind.
[203:21.04]Okay.
[203:23.09]But we have time.
[203:24.31]You see a guy?
[203:26.83]I was hoping I wasn't going to get a lucky shot in the head.
[203:29.83]You just shoot vaguely towards the... Is that him?
[203:32.97]I can't tell.
[203:33.43]It's trying to freak him out a little.
[203:36.38]We should probably start moving then.
[203:39.54]The blue's moving.
[203:40.34]I want to get this guy before we move.
[203:42.28]He's going to run from the shed.
[203:44.52]With the blue thing on it.
[203:45.36]The Superman shed.
[203:51.35]Left.
[203:51.57]He's left of it.
[203:52.67]He's right there.
[204:01.50]Is that you?
[204:02.06]Yep.
[204:02.28]He's dead.
[204:03.16]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[204:04.04]Another guy.
[204:05.08]My door.
[204:05.72]Yep.
[204:07.46]Windows.
[204:08.83]I'll watch the door.
[204:09.25]I'll watch the door.
[204:10.37]Whoa, shit.
[204:10.95]Window, window, window, window.
[204:15.05]He's like right in front of you.
[204:21.74]I'm gonna bleed.
[204:22.98]Okay, crawl towards me.
[204:27.58]Five seconds, I'm dead.
[204:28.88]Three, two, one, dead.
[204:30.58]Wow, you died way fast.
[204:32.71]Oh, because of the blue.
[204:33.91]We're in the blue.
[204:35.53]Hey, we made it to top five.
[204:39.85]$10,000.
[204:41.13]We got trapped in the house.
[204:42.17]There were people right there.
[204:43.29]If we ran, it was too late.
[204:48.84]Come on.
[204:49.16]That was a reasonable conclusion.
[204:51.87]That was a reasonable conclusion.
[204:53.57]Like, come on.
[204:54.07]That was fair.
[204:59.33]I was so focused on the two guys that had surprised me at the door.
[205:02.61]I forgot about the stupid blue horse.
[205:04.19]Hey, by the way, I had three kills.
[205:05.73]That was bullshit.
[205:07.18]I got a double kill.
[205:07.92]You had four.
[205:08.24]I had four kills.
[205:09.24]You actually had four.
[205:10.20]Alright.
[205:14.20]One more.
[205:14.48]We're going to do one more.
[205:16.00]See, I was happy with that game.
[205:17.18]Like, that game went well.
[205:18.22]Alright.
[205:18.66]Okay.
[205:18.82]So if the next one goes terrible, that was the last one.
[205:25.92]Considering who it is, impressive.
[205:29.48]You weren't aiming at the shack, by the way.
[205:31.00]I was aiming at the airdrop.
[205:32.16]What?
[205:34.73]I thought we were aiming at the red thing with the blue thing on it.
[205:37.99]I think the airdrop was beyond the shack, so it was a little bit above it.
[205:42.61]But those guys didn't come from the shack.
[205:44.11]They came from somewhere else.
[205:45.75]Wager just gave 50 bucks.
[205:47.07]Good job on top five.
[205:48.09]That's $150 from Wager.
[205:53.70]That game was fucking fun.
[205:55.24]That one was fun.
[205:55.96]Alright, so I'm figuring it out.
[205:59.16]It's fun.
[206:01.51]If you're watching the VOD right now and you didn't leave in disgust because of what I said previously, it's a fun game.
[206:12.81]But thank you, Wager, for the $150.
[206:14.02]That's a lot of money.
[206:16.06]Etalyx is going to get like 5%.
[206:17.70]Etalyx will get like $3 from that one.
[206:21.90]No, I'm kidding.
[206:23.51]I get a royalty on every donation.
[206:25.25]You get a royalty because, like, you... Yeah.
[206:33.69]Oh, whoops.
[206:37.51]So, uh... Somebody said something I think is true.
[206:42.32]Yeah?
[206:42.96]You would probably enjoy four-man squads.
[206:45.40]Like, if stealth was here, and, uh, carrying...
[206:50.27]And Mariah was there.
[206:51.75]You probably have more fun.
[206:53.23]It's a good game.
[206:55.45]It's fun.
[206:57.31]This game is a fun game.
[207:01.61]I'm not very good.
[207:02.65]I just have a short fuse.
[207:04.03]And if I lose my attention span for one second, I lose my mind.
[207:07.42]I have a little bit of map knowledge and zero aiming skills.
[207:14.67]Well, dude, that gun, that sniper rifle that I had, that was difficult to hit anybody with that thing.
[207:20.98]It seems like it was pretty good, I guess.
[207:22.58]It's just the fact that it has a silencer on it makes it better.
[207:27.04]I felt like I had to lead targets so much and that the drop was literally like I was throwing a rock with my hand.
[207:34.70]We would not have gotten half that far if we both did not have silencers.
[207:42.49]Because we would have been shooting the whole time and they would know exactly where we are.
[207:47.61]We just sat in that house for like 15 minutes.
[207:50.23]Nobody had a clue.
[207:50.87]You got a short fuse, Jermo, but you're a damn good cop.
[207:54.51]Alright, so here... I want your gun and your bag.
[207:58.93]StixRenegadeGave7Dolls says, For getting top four with plus three kills, another hundred dollars is... Now, I don't want to give incentive to pay me money.
[208:08.14]We don't have to do that.
[208:10.26]If I get to number one, I expect five grand.
[208:13.01]Okay, can we do at least one, like, no stress, running and get killed thing?
[208:18.61]Yeah, let's do that.
[208:20.71]And if it works, then it works.
[208:23.59]Okay, we're going to go to the yellow marker.
[208:25.83]Here, somebody gave, mostly lost, gave $3.42.
[208:27.77]Here's a Etalyx's Commission.
[208:30.63]Give it to him or I'll sue you to get it back.
[208:34.73]Alright, three, two, one, jump and look west.
[208:38.32]Mm-hmm.
[208:40.71]Look at all the people looking west with us.
[208:43.98]We're going to the, uh, I've marked on the map.
[208:47.34]To the containers over here.
[208:49.18]To the three that are by themselves furthest west.
[208:53.62]Yep.
[208:54.70]I see.
[208:56.96]I see them.
[209:00.20]So this is the joke run?
[209:02.40]Uh, yeah.
[209:03.11]I mean, like, if we win, great.
[209:07.03]I'm not anticipating winning.
[209:08.33]So this is just a straight up joke run?
[209:10.36]Yeah, this is like, I just want to shoot things and kind of detox.
[209:14.28]Okay.
[209:15.44]Now, can I pee before we do the last one?
[209:17.66]Yeah.
[209:18.14]Okay, good.
[209:19.18]Go ahead.
[209:25.40]That guy's going to, I can't go in that one.
[209:28.58]Okay, if you land on top of these things, sometimes there's actually guns up here.
[209:31.86]I'm so dead.
[209:33.08]I can't go in that one.
[209:34.34]Can't go in the one on the left, can't go in the middle one.
[209:35.88]Alright, what's behind curtain number three?
[209:38.60]Just come to me.
[209:39.88]Hold on.
[209:41.08]And we'll just run.
[209:47.60]Is there anybody in yours?
[209:48.90]No.
[209:49.48]There's a gun in here, too.
[209:50.14]There's a bunch of stuff in here.
[209:50.97]There's a guy on the containers to your right.
[209:52.43]There's a guy chasing me, I think.
[210:05.75]Is he?
[210:05.93]I don't see anybody.
[210:10.03]Where's this guy?
[210:11.07]Who are you shooting at?
[210:12.11]That's a long range shotgun blast.
[210:20.36]Hit that guy once.
[210:27.90]I got that guy one time.
[210:29.04]Oh well.
[210:30.28]Alright, if you watch that side, I'll watch this side.
[210:32.06]Okay, I'll watch this side.
[210:39.29]He's knocked out.
[210:39.95]Ah, another guy.
[210:40.37]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[210:41.23]Throwing a grenade in here.
[210:42.93]Oh, that guy just seems like jumping around.
[210:44.33]Okay.
[210:52.04]Yeah, they're both dead.
[210:58.46]I hear footsteps kind of in front of us.
[211:05.17]Good job so far.
[211:08.68]He's on the outside.
[211:10.08]Which way?
[211:11.41]Wait, that could be you.
[211:13.11]You make different footsteps when you're crouched.
[211:14.63]It's weird.
[211:15.33]Freaks me out.
[211:17.41]Oh, who killed this guy?
[211:18.67]Me.
[211:19.09]Oh!
[211:19.87]Around the corner.
[211:23.71]Good luck.
[211:24.20]He's dead.
[211:25.08]Alright, I'm crawling in between cover.
[211:27.10]Is there anybody around there?
[211:27.86]He's still alive.
[211:29.74]Just run straight to me.
[211:30.96]Shit, I'm gonna get hit.
[211:35.38]I think he's above.
[211:37.10]But just keep reviving.
[211:39.79]Watch him like pop out of here.
[211:40.71]I'm like one hit and I'm dead.
[211:42.69]I killed that guy.
[211:43.28]He's dead.
[211:45.54]Thank you, my savior.
[211:46.68]Do you have any meds?
[211:48.22]Nothing.
[211:49.62]Absolutely nothing.
[211:51.90]You first then.
[211:54.34]I'm getting carried right now.
[212:00.38]Who are you and what did you do with Jerva?
[212:02.34]I fucking strangled him and took the stream over.
[212:06.81]I'm afraid to go out here.
[212:07.59]I think we should go back and look for medicine.
[212:09.51]yeah because we can be relatively sure so that guy died didn't go down this guy is he's straight up dead no I know but like when you killed him yeah I shot him like right in the face okay what I'm saying is if they ragdoll as soon as you kill them instead of going down that means their partner is also dead oh interesting
[212:33.71]So when I ask you, did he go down or did he die?
[212:38.21]Well, it said kills.
[212:39.09]It said you got three kills on the screen when I shot him.
[212:41.01]Alright.
[212:41.23]We should probably get out of here.
[212:56.54]I want to check this last one because I am one hit from just dying.
[213:00.97]Yeah, we both are.
[213:02.95]Oh, well.
[213:06.44]No, I am actually... You'll at least go down.
[213:08.42]I am actually one hit from dying.
[213:11.36]Is this a body armor?
[213:13.16]Ooh, a police vest.
[213:15.76]No medicine whatsoever.
[213:17.00]Okay.
[213:26.75]Should we try to go that way to the other houses?
[213:29.63]That's where guaranteed more people are.
[213:31.31]Actually, see someone?
[213:34.31]Who?
[213:35.32]No.
[213:38.20]If you look inside the open containers here, sometimes there's stuff.
[213:44.00]Not always.
[213:46.34]Watch us win on the joke round, somebody said.
[213:48.50]Yeah.
[213:48.89]That would be funny.
[213:49.69]That would be cool.
[213:50.93]Well, then the joke round becomes the real round, doesn't it?
[213:54.05]Doesn't it?
[213:54.39]Yeah.
[214:10.75]Holosight.
[214:13.71]Shotgun in here.
[214:16.77]Body armor level 2.
[214:17.51]Alright.
[214:28.38]I'm pretty sure there's at least a couple other people here.
[214:31.36]Helmet.
[214:33.89]Motorcycle helmet.
[214:34.99]There's another thing in there.
[214:42.18]took this long to find a backpack I still don't have one I don't even have a backpack Etalyx that's okay there's almost nothing here I think the people who looted it are already long gone yeah we we need to find we need to go to a house and find some medicine
[215:11.82]Are we going to get to one of these houses over here?
[215:20.02]What's our play here, Etalyx?
[215:21.39]Well, we're going to be fine if we just stick... The blue circle's coming, so I just want to get outside this stupid fence and make sure we're safe inside.
[215:32.07]But I'm afraid of one stray bullet is going to end the joke run.
[215:36.05]And it's not a joke anymore because we survived the hot zone because you killed everybody.
[215:41.85]I did get a few people.
[215:43.48]Yeah.
[215:44.56]You killed everybody.
[215:45.24]Metallics is hiding stuff from you.
[215:50.08]Kill him.
[215:51.86]Trying to turn on each other.
[215:53.80]Trying to plant the seed of deceit.
[215:57.31]He's leading you into a trap.
[215:59.33]Wait, what are they talking about?
[216:00.13]What'd you do?
[216:02.03]God, that would be so bad if I just did that.
[216:07.09]I can't... Yeah, I can't... Guys, I can't betray Etalyx when there's 60 people alive.
[216:10.67]It has to be within the top, like, three.
[216:11.89]That's too many.
[216:19.62]Following me, bad idea.
[216:21.40]Following you, bad idea.
[216:22.24]Yeah, I just ran all the way around.
[216:24.00]So?
[216:24.36]This place sucks.
[216:31.45]Do you have a sight on your gun?
[216:33.19]Nope.
[216:34.91]Come get this one.
[216:40.02]I like this gun better.
[216:46.21]Okay.
[216:46.75]I'm about like 65, 70, 80, 90, maybe even 100% confident that there's people in this little compound up ahead.
[216:56.93]Hold on.
[217:00.40]Whoopsie.
[217:01.14]What are you whoopsie?
[217:03.70]Nothing.
[217:05.16]What's the matter?
[217:05.96]Don't go without me.
[217:07.10]Nothing.
[217:07.92]I didn't shoot.
[217:10.19]Don't let people know we have a presence here.
[217:13.23]That wasn't me.
[217:15.53]Test your gun on it.
[217:18.37]I just tested my gun on the dirt.
[217:20.87]And now everybody knows we're over here and now we're going to die.
[217:23.63]My bad.
[217:26.69]It kind of just happened.
[217:27.67]Hold on, let me take care of this.
[217:28.60]Let's see.
[217:31.40]Are you like aiming at the back of my head right now?
[217:33.96]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[217:36.18]What the fuck is that?
[217:36.94]I heard something.
[217:41.37]I wish it made that.
[217:49.93]Wish it made that noise.
[217:55.25]Etalyx is trying to kill you.
[217:56.26]Gotta get him first.
[217:57.12]I've already been here.
[218:02.30]I hear people attacking each other.
[218:06.28]We are not the first.
[218:08.22]Choke.
[218:08.76]Oh, choke.
[218:10.08]That's what we're gonna do.
[218:13.95]Well, there's a motorcycle.
[218:15.65]There is a bumper cycle here.
[218:17.15]We really need medicine.
[218:27.90]Why am I so sweaty right now?
[218:29.24]Why am I such a sweaty boy?
[218:30.60]Because it's scary.
[218:32.46]Motorcycle.
[218:33.04]Yep.
[218:33.54]Somebody's coming.
[218:37.01]They're probably going to come in here.
[218:39.81]He does.
[218:47.50]I got one.
[218:48.42]The other guy's got hit at least three times.
[218:51.68]Push.
[218:52.02]I'd say push.
[218:52.80]You can go out.
[218:54.74]You go left.
[218:55.48]I'll go right.
[218:58.51]He's going right.
[219:03.33]Shit!
[219:03.51]He's right here.
[219:04.55]One hit.
[219:06.09]Nice.
[219:06.21]Got him.
[219:07.49]Help me!
[219:13.33]And now let's rummage through that person's stuff.
[219:15.64]Woohoo!
[219:19.64]Alright, please tell me you had like a bunch of fucking first aid.
[219:23.38]Yes!
[219:26.03]I'll get the guy inside.
[219:26.89]Okay.
[219:27.79]Wait, what do you mean?
[219:28.41]Oh, yeah, okay.
[219:30.55]So he has eight, like, ten different scopes.
[219:33.61]Oh my god, really?
[219:34.27]Okay, bandages, four times scope.
[219:39.63]These guys had a lot of shit, didn't they?
[219:41.59]Holographic sight?
[219:42.47]I mean, like, I don't know.
[219:45.98]You only need one sight on your gun, so...
[219:48.54]I know, but there's so many things.
[219:49.38]Just pick whichever one you like.
[219:50.96]I want the coat, too.
[219:52.08]I want to be a badass.
[219:55.08]Um... Extended mag?
[220:00.26]No?
[220:01.23]Oops.
[220:01.57]There's another car.
[220:02.09]Get inside.
[220:05.05]Come inside.
[220:05.45]Another car?
[220:12.89]Uh, it is southwest.
[220:15.05]You're looking the opposite direction.
[220:18.55]Two headphones.
[220:19.47]Alright, we have to start moving in.
[220:22.41]We've got three minutes, so we are alright for now.
[220:27.10]But we've got kind of a lengthy run.
[220:29.56]We need to get the ammo over there.
[220:30.44]Hold on.
[220:32.18]There's too many things.
[220:32.74]I don't know.
[220:33.08]There's too many things, Etalyx.
[220:33.86]It's okay.
[220:35.32]They dropped us a motorcycle, so we're not really in a hurry.
[220:42.29]At least I have ammo for this.
[220:46.75]Four times on the table.
[220:47.57]I gotta go.
[220:49.71]We gotta go.
[220:50.43]There's too many things to look at.
[220:51.57]Whoa, whoa.
[220:52.21]Okay, that's you.
[220:54.39]Hold on.
[220:54.73]Don't leave me.
[220:57.88]Go, go, go.
[220:59.62]Is there ammo for this gun?
[221:00.96]What gun do you have?
[221:02.80]5.56.
[221:03.34]Do you need it?
[221:04.06]Yes.
[221:05.64]I don't need that many.
[221:06.36]I don't need like 200.
[221:07.48]Here, take... There.
[221:09.24]I just dropped something on the ground.
[221:10.76]I already... Okay.
[221:11.94]Let's go.
[221:13.06]That's fine.
[221:14.74]And there's, like, a grip, too.
[221:16.12]You get the grip.
[221:16.60]Get the grip.
[221:17.16]The people are screaming at me.
[221:18.62]Okay.
[221:19.38]I got the grip.
[221:20.06]People are screaming at me.
[221:21.20]I got the grip.
[221:22.26]And the other compensator.
[221:23.48]I got him.
[221:24.58]Take the bike and leave.
[221:25.78]Etalyx.
[221:29.24]I can't shoot back here?
[221:31.54]You have to pick, like, it has to be a smaller gun.
[221:33.54]You can't do, like, assault rifle.
[221:34.97]Oh.
[221:36.15]This is just like GTA.
[221:38.45]Oh.
[221:39.81]What do you mean, oh?
[221:40.45]Physics.
[221:41.81]Physics.
[221:42.81]Telex, don't make our last joke run a joke.
[221:47.31]This kind of did turn into the last run.
[221:49.42]It did.
[221:54.40]You got to attach the AK directly onto the pistol?
[221:59.60]What?
[222:00.62]Alright.
[222:00.98]So get prepared to fight up ahead.
[222:02.90]Okay.
[222:04.20]We're just going to sit inside like this little inside the circle, just barely.
[222:10.68]And other people might be doing the same thing.
[222:14.74]Okay.
[222:15.90]Right up here.
[222:18.71]So don't make... Let's not be the guys that we just killed, you know?
[222:22.25]Yeah.
[222:22.87]But they can hear us.
[222:24.09]We're very loud.
[222:24.85]That's fine.
[222:25.69]We just don't charge into the first... Somebody's been in here, but they're not here anymore.
[222:32.91]Hmm.
[222:34.41]Actually, there's no door.
[222:36.17]What about all this shit?
[222:38.85]Maybe nobody's been in here.
[222:40.21]There's a crossbow?
[222:41.27]You said the thing, don't take this stuff, right?
[222:42.90]Don't, no.
[222:44.05]Unless it's a funny joke.
[222:45.39]Somebody dropped that stuff because it was bad.
[222:53.86]Switch your helmet out for the one on the ground, please.
[222:57.84]Mm-hmm.
[223:00.06]Mm-hmm.
[223:02.60]Why does everybody want me to die?
[223:03.78]I know.
[223:04.02]Why does everybody want me to kill Etalyx?
[223:06.95]What did he do?
[223:12.58]You really have.
[223:13.12]Dude, why do you have zero health?
[223:16.43]I actually have full health.
[223:18.01]Oh.
[223:19.55]Painkillers.
[223:20.07]Did you say that taking a bandage will make you get full health?
[223:23.39]Painkillers or Red Bull energy drinks.
[223:26.19]So painkillers.
[223:27.55]So I should use the painkillers now?
[223:29.15]Yeah.
[223:31.41]Yes.
[223:35.74]Get the crossbow and shoot him in the head.
[223:39.08]God.
[223:39.94]Okay, so see how we're on the edge of the white circle?
[223:42.80]I do.
[223:44.27]You see how the blue is now moving in?
[223:46.11]So the most likely place for people to come from is the north and northwest.
[223:51.15]And there will be some humans.
[223:52.57]We need to go on the north and northwest houses.
[223:54.77]Need to watch out for the fucking humans.
[224:00.40]Watch out for the humans.
[224:02.58]We got an M16 on the ground if you want it.
[224:05.16]M16?
[224:05.46]Does that include humans?
[224:09.33]Quick draw.
[224:09.67]I already have that shit.
[224:14.87]Sickle is... Make sure you... Do you need the ammo here?
[224:24.20]No, I'm good.
[224:25.32]Can you stop following me around with the sickle?
[224:28.30]This is a serious game.
[224:29.48]Just a couple of humans.
[224:32.56]Just a couple of humans.
[224:38.78]Don't do it.
[224:40.56]Don't do it.
[224:41.86]Can you do it before I do it?
[224:43.19]No, don't do it.
[224:43.95]Don't do it.
[224:44.93]We're in the top 40.
[224:45.55]Come on.
[224:47.17]Just a couple of humans.
[225:00.35]No, I'm not going to do it.
[225:01.77]We're not doing that.
[225:02.54]Okay, I'm moving up to the last house.
[225:06.86]The one that's closest to the corner.
[225:08.54]The one most likely to harbor scary people.
[225:17.69]Gold.
[225:19.99]Ooh, gold.
[225:22.89]Oh, my head's kind of hurting.
[225:24.55]This has to be the last one.
[225:26.33]I'm getting a head ache.
[225:30.98]Where are all the people?
[225:32.51]I don't know.
[225:33.85]There comes the blue.
[225:34.79]Here comes the blue.
[225:35.47]The blue's here.
[225:36.17]I don't see anybody.
[225:38.93]I don't hear anybody.
[225:39.83]They're going to be the other direction.
[225:41.51]I don't smell anybody.
[225:44.23]North and northwest, if they were anywhere.
[225:45.87]I don't smell anybody.
[225:47.04]I don't hear anybody.
[225:47.86]I don't see anybody.
[225:50.96]We should probably keep moving Etalyx.
[225:54.18]Okay.
[225:54.28]Okay.
[225:58.13]I don't see anybody.
[225:59.19]I don't hear anybody.
[226:00.21]I don't smell anybody.
[226:02.61]Get us out of here.
[226:10.88]I feel like it's going to be one of those rounds where we just get surprised sniped in the head.
[226:15.74]It's possible.
[226:16.18]Oh, there's a car up here.
[226:19.70]guys guys oh Etalyx easy oh where are the where are the guys where I think they were on the road to the left that we just crossed over there were two cars right next to each other what were they having a smoke break I don't know but I'm not sticking around to find out one of those guys having a fucking smoke break I really want to jump the headshot no don't you do it
[226:48.44]Why did I go in first person for that?
[226:50.89]Watch out.
[226:52.97]House is up ahead.
[226:53.91]Watch out.
[226:56.71]No!
[226:58.39]Why did you get off already?
[227:00.23]Why did you do that?
[227:01.73]Help!
[227:03.33]I can't.
[227:03.71]There's guys in this house.
[227:05.15]What are you thinking?
[227:06.21]You backed up into me.
[227:07.27]Yeah, I was adjusting.
[227:09.63]Oh, god damn it.
[227:10.79]They're on the hill.
[227:15.19]Not like this, Jerma.
[227:16.61]Well, you were driving like a fucking maniac.
[227:22.97]You were driving like a goddamn maniac.
[227:25.83]And we stopped, and then you backed over me.
[227:28.83]What the fuck?
[227:31.11]I like how everyone's saying, nice, Etalyx.
[227:33.54]Like, good job.
[227:35.38]Nice.
[227:36.28]I got sniped.
[227:38.04]I'm fucking gone.
[227:39.66]I'm outta here.
[227:41.08]Nice.
[227:42.16]Good job.
[227:43.44]Should've killed Etalyx first.
[227:44.93]I should've.
[227:46.01]That would've been like a better ending.
[227:48.63]That would've been a fucking better ending.
[227:51.91]I love how you crashed directly into the fucking wall.
[227:57.36]And then we were stopped.
[227:58.57]I got off the bike and you backed over me.
[228:00.77]Let me explain myself.
[228:04.10]Let me explain myself.
[228:05.48]Okay, go for it.
[228:06.58]Okay, so when we crashed into the wall, I didn't immediately know there were people in the house that I crashed into.
[228:11.67]Okay, so I was working on the assumption we were by ourselves.
[228:14.97]So with that in mind, I wanted to back the bike up so if we needed to make a getaway, the bike was facing outward, not into the house that we crashed into.
[228:23.44]So I was like, okay, I'm just going to back up like two steps and point it forward.
[228:27.02]So at that exact moment that my brain said, push S on the keyboard, you hopped off and I apparently ran over you and insta-downed you.
[228:34.37]And then the guy in the window behind me unloaded on me, but I survived.
[228:39.64]So there's the explanation.
[228:42.38]They probably saw that and were like, what a bunch of fucking idiots.
[228:45.82]Imagine seeing that.
[228:46.99]That'd be so funny.
[228:47.75]Alright.
[228:48.79]Well, thank you for playing, Etalyx.
[228:50.29]Thank you for introducing me to the game.
[228:51.93]I'm going to give you my final thoughts on the game.
[228:57.69]You just got to play it for a few hours and understand the game.
[229:00.70]And that's all it is.
[229:02.40]It's a fun game.
[229:03.00]I like it.
[229:05.22]I might play it again.
[229:05.90]I don't know.
[229:07.16]We'll see.
[229:08.20]Tomorrow, there's a couple of options.
[229:09.72]This might be one of them.
[229:10.64]I don't know.
[229:11.02]This was fun.
[229:12.36]Who knows?
[229:13.72]Well, I had fun.

[229:52.87]Mr. Sark, the real Mr. Sark said, good job on the PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds lessons.
[230:00.15]I'm learning a lot.
[230:02.71]Good old Sark.
[230:04.28]Everybody loves Sark.
[230:05.20]And if you don't love Sark, then I just, I don't know if I could, I don't know if I could agree with you.
[230:10.78]He's a very funny, very skilled, talented man.
[230:14.86]And also my vocal down.
[230:16.52]And also sounds kind of like you.
