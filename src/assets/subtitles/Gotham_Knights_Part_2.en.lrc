[00:03.31]I am back.
[00:08.16]Who's ready?
[00:11.40]For Gotham Knights!
[00:12.34]Did I scare you?
[00:21.23]I didn't mean to.
[00:23.69]Yeah, just went to the bathroom, filled up my drink.
[00:27.73]Very cool.
[00:28.47]Uh-huh.
[00:34.33]Get the audio going.
[00:36.89]Make sure you can hear this.
[00:37.85]Alright.
[00:40.93]It's time to begin.
[00:41.53]This is a sponsored segment of today's stream.
[00:44.83]Like yesterday.
[00:45.35]Uh, there we go.
[00:56.86]Fix the BRB music.
[00:57.92]Yeah, I know.
[01:01.50]Okay.
[01:03.11]Let me make sure you can see it.
[01:13.72]There we go.
[01:14.58]Alright.
[01:15.72]Let's get this over here.
[01:20.60]Where am I?
[01:21.22]Where did I go?
[01:23.32]There I am.
[01:24.54]Facing the wrong direction.
[01:26.94]Let's flip that.
[01:31.24]Uh.
[01:33.07]Bang.
[01:35.63]And now you will be able to see the game.
[01:45.78]There.
[01:49.46]Alright.
[01:50.68]We played yesterday.
[01:51.42]We were playing as Nightwing.
[01:54.74]We're going to play as a different character today.
[01:56.84]Thank you to Warner Brothers for sponsoring this part of the stream.
[01:59.67]The game is out right now.
[02:01.91]It's out now.
[02:03.90]Gotham Knights is on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S, Series X, and PC.
[02:10.56]What was the last thing we did?
[02:23.87]Alright, who should, what character should I play as?
[02:31.92]I want to play as a different character.
[02:34.08]And I guess the question is, how do you change a character?
[02:37.23]Play Red Hood?
[02:37.71]Okay.
[02:37.97]How do you change character?
[02:40.37]Red Hood?
[02:40.77]Alright, we'll do Red Hood today.
[02:42.27]Why would she help Batman?
[02:44.23]Or us?
[02:55.23]You have to ask.
[02:56.57]There's definitely a way to do it, right?
[03:02.99]Did I not unlock that part yet?
[03:06.83]Is it on the workbench?
[03:09.40]Do a poll?
[03:11.08]Actually, you know what?
[03:11.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:12.28]Let's do a poll.
[03:15.14]I want to play as a different character.
[03:16.08]So do you want Robin, Red Hood, or Batgirl?
[03:21.42]Let's get a poll.
[03:33.34]Alright, let's open the bat computer.
[03:34.80]So, alright, yeah, this is the last thing we just did.
[03:37.37]Harley Quinn called from Blackgate Penitentiary.
[03:44.51]Oh, you have to go to the suits.
[03:45.73]Alright.
[03:46.31]Well, let's go take a look.
[03:47.09]I'll give you a nice look at it so you can see what you're getting into here.
[03:51.25]Suits are... Where are they?
[03:53.04]Here they are.
[03:54.16]Okay.
[03:54.26]Here you go.
[03:56.88]We've been playing as Nightwing.
[03:57.70]We're going to play as somebody else.
[03:58.68]Robin.
[03:59.04]Robin.
[04:01.54]Robin has the big, uh, bow staff.
[04:05.22]And it's Robin.
[04:07.98]Batgirl.
[04:09.36]Has... I think she throws stuff?
[04:15.84]Red Hood.
[04:17.45]Has, um, guns?
[04:20.65]I think?
[04:25.73]What character are we doing?
[04:31.62]Dude, Red Hood has guns.
[04:32.58]Yeah, whatever.
[04:33.12]It's neck and neck.
[04:33.64]Batgirl and Red Hood.
[04:34.32]Robin is in last.
[04:34.76]A lot of people are really kind of sleeping on Robin here.
[04:37.26]I think Robin's probably going to be really good.
[05:05.43]It's- alright.
[05:06.39]Is it really that close?
[05:07.39]I can't see.
[05:11.80]It's too close.
[05:12.66]Well, it's- we're not doing it again.
[05:14.00]Who's- who's winning?
[05:36.77]47%.
[05:37.33]That was close.
[05:39.75]That was very close.
[05:40.47]Let me just tweet.
[05:46.86]Alright, we're doing Red Hood.
[05:47.52]I threw how?
[05:58.45]Oh, alright.
[05:58.71]I probably should have done this.
[06:07.83]Brute strength powerhouse brawler, master marksman, 27 power.
[06:12.25]I should have done this.
[06:14.31]Expert hacker, tough as nails, single target bruiser.
[06:18.75]Well, we're doing it.
[06:20.23]Let's do Red Hood.
[06:33.22]Oh my, he's huge.
[06:44.86]He's massive.
[06:46.68]Alright.
[06:48.76]Let's start on the patrol.
[06:54.07]Also, yeah, I have a panel.
[06:56.51]If you're interested, click the panel.
[06:57.91]Click the panel image.
[06:58.55]You can buy it.
[07:02.30]Pre-order it.
[07:02.78]Although the pre-order is over.
[07:03.88]I mean, it's out now.
[07:04.58]It's literally out right now.
[07:18.63]Alright, I'm ready to begin.
[07:20.59]Again, thank you Warner Brothers.
[07:22.67]Sponsored.
[07:23.97]Let's go!
[07:24.85]Time to protect Gotham City!
[07:29.42]In case you want to use that anywhere.
[07:30.82]Like, you're absolutely more than welcome to.
[07:33.00]You can.
[07:33.64]If you want to use that clip of me, you know, getting ready.
[07:41.79]Alright, I'm excited actually.
[07:43.37]Right when I started having fun, I had internet problems last night.
[07:45.79]And that's not here right now, so let's go.
[07:49.38]What is Red Hood's moves?
[07:58.97]Wait, I should look at... Hold on.
[08:00.35]I want to see the... What's he got?
[08:03.76]Abilities.
[08:04.36]Alright, hold on.
[08:05.50]I have two points to put in.
[08:07.93]Because from my understanding, when you level up any character, you level all of them up, essentially, at the same time.
[08:13.73]I guess that's to prevent you playing through the whole game and being like, you know what, I want to play as Batgirl, but I'm literally at zero and I can't do anything.
[08:21.63]So, we have Marksman, Brawler, and Vengeance.
[08:24.57]We have two points.
[08:27.09]Red Hood performs a perfectly timed evade that generates momentum.
[08:29.67]We have that also.
[08:32.88]Critical damage by 20%.
[08:35.62]Red Hood can aim longer at a target to deal four times damage.
[08:38.88]I think that's what I want.
[08:40.18]Should we do guns?
[08:44.10]Definitely.
[08:44.38]I mean, perfect evade, you need it.
[08:47.56]And then guns, the longer you aim, you do more damage.
[08:51.85]Gun.
[08:53.01]What are the other ones?
[08:57.35]When Red Hood throws an enemy, he attaches a concussion mine to them that explodes.
[09:02.71]That's pretty good.
[09:03.55]That's three points.
[09:07.52]Okay.
[09:08.68]I feel like I'm gonna like this character.
[09:09.90]Let's see.
[09:11.22]Is there like a little crime I can do just to learn his moveset?
[09:15.60]There's gotta be like a crime going on.
[09:16.78]Yeah, over here.
[09:30.13]Oh shit, what happened?
[09:32.71]No, get off the bike!
[09:33.61]What are you doing?
[09:35.27]What happened?
[09:38.92]What happened here?
[09:39.44]Do you need help?
[09:41.88]How do I help?
[09:43.98]Was I too late?
[09:46.48]How was I too late?
[09:47.38]Did the criminals already get away?
[09:56.15]I'm such a shitty superhero.
[09:58.49]Get back on the bike.
[10:11.67]Alright, here we are.
[10:13.61]Shh, quiet.
[10:17.10]Alright, I'm gonna dismount.
[10:17.98]Let's go.
[10:22.20]I'm getting, like, texts.
[10:23.76]My phone is just blowing up right now.
[10:26.66]Red Hood, where are you, man?
[10:29.52]Red Hood, your location says that you're over by, like, the... Wait, where are you?
[10:34.63]You're going the wrong way, dude.
[10:37.73]Why does it say you're inside of the museum?
[10:41.82]I'll just make a bunch of shit up.
[10:44.66]I actually don't know where the fuck I'm going.
[10:58.93]There we go.
[11:01.27]Okay, let's go.
[11:08.63]What?
[11:08.85]Why am I shooting behind me?
[11:15.47]Alright, that's pretty cool.
[11:21.37]Okay, this is awesome.
[11:29.62]Is that somebody just shooting at you?
[11:34.58]What is this move?
[11:46.22]Put this camera away Didn't even I didn't even need to fucking look
[12:18.43]They're not even paying attention.
[12:19.43]Yeah, I got a gun too.
[12:23.99]Huh?
[12:24.33]Alright, I think I got the moveset down.
[12:50.12]I got points for that, right?
[12:52.82]Call Nightwing.
[12:53.62]He's crying.
[12:55.06]No, we're Red Hood friends now.
[12:59.86]Alright, I get it.
[13:00.38]I get the moveset.
[13:00.94]I want to level those guns up.
[13:05.20]By the way, there's gear in the game, too.
[13:07.08]So... He doesn't have any gear.
[13:11.28]Right.
[13:12.18]Okay.
[13:12.62]Well, I guess I do have better stuff.
[13:15.38]So these are better pistols.
[13:17.48]Ooh.
[13:21.58]We're going with the beyond suit.
[13:23.70]I probably should have put the gear on before attacking anybody.
[13:29.08]And what else?
[13:30.76]Melee.
[13:36.08]Cool.
[13:36.28]Alright, that's better.
[13:37.18]Alright, Harley Quinn.
[13:51.29]I love how everybody can do a wheelie.
[14:02.82]I thought I could grab something.
[14:13.27]I bet Robin can't do a wheelie.
[14:14.89]Oh, please.
[14:16.61]We'll find out.
[14:22.12]Is Harley Quinn just sitting?
[14:23.56]No, isn't Harley Quinn in the... Let's go.
[14:36.44]Alright, let's do it.
[14:39.98]This is probably a boss of some kind, I imagine.
[14:46.42]This suit does look awesome.
[14:50.07]How do you see somebody walking down the fucking street like this?
[15:02.82]Do an E3 walk.
[15:03.42]What?
[15:08.29]Wait, I'm not supposed to be here?
[15:10.31]I'm not supposed to be here.
[15:11.19]A guy in a huge superhero costume just walking in the front door.
[15:15.77]Yeah, we got a guy in a fucking superhero outfit walking into the front door.
[15:21.68]Looks like he's armed.
[15:22.60]How do we proceed?
[15:40.22]What would you even say?
[15:43.10]Alright, let's do it.
[15:44.34]Casting.
[16:11.28]Find a way into the prison.
[16:12.14]Okay, I guess I have to get in here.
[16:27.25]I'm in.
[16:27.59]Alright, let's... Are there guards in here?
[16:57.26]Alright.
[16:58.08]I missed.
[17:04.64]I'm getting another...
[17:26.67]Red Hood, man, what are you doing in there?
[17:33.07]Hold it right there.
[17:34.41]Wait, I shouldn't be.
[17:36.89]We can't let Red Hood escape.
[17:37.87]Get after him.
[17:42.58]Am I going to open this door with my bare hands?
[17:47.84]Oh.
[17:48.16]You know he's already dead, right?
[17:50.48]Yeah.
[17:50.78]I'm not done yet.
[18:01.43]Yeah.
[18:01.71]Wait, interrogate.
[18:17.78]Interrogate, interrogate.
[18:25.37]Did I?
[18:32.41]I can't target.
[18:40.22]You've interrogated.
[18:46.22]I love when he does the lip thing.
[18:48.59]What I do?
[18:51.01]Yeah, Mike, I don't know why.
[18:52.29]Whenever I play Gotham Knights.
[18:55.57]Party balloons and a fight.
[18:57.19]I wonder why my webcam does this nearby.
[19:03.21]Well, this webcam stinks.
[19:07.61]I don't think I want to do this.
[19:13.75]Avoid taking damage.
[19:15.01]Defeat all the invades and don't take any damage.
[19:19.75]That's going to be kind of hard.
[19:20.57]Alright, let me see if I can take some out before we get noticed.
[19:24.62]And then let me play the stealth aspects of this game the way I'm supposed to.
[19:31.72]Well, don't slam him on the ground.
[19:33.51]Oh, shit.
[19:38.77]Is there somebody just puke?
[19:48.90]I think somebody just threw up.
[20:26.20]Did I shoot him in the face when I did that?
[20:28.33]Holy shit.
[21:00.32]Fucking scoop slam.
[21:09.71]You were trying to push her into the fire.
[21:12.65]I was trying to go for an environmental... Wait, is this it?
[21:24.92]What do you know?
[21:43.09]I feel like I would do something like that.
[21:44.83]Looks like you've been eating well.
[21:48.25]Still big as an ox and twice as mean.
[21:54.55]Been a while, Harley.
[21:56.87]You good?
[21:59.25]So it is different.
[22:00.11]Was it too much to ask you to visit earlier?
[22:04.11]So each character has different dialogue with every encounter.
[22:06.89]That's kind of cool.
[22:09.26]What was it?
[22:12.33]Wait a second.
[22:15.73]This means the Bats is dead.
[22:18.62]For real.
[22:20.36]Well, then.
[22:31.66]He asked me to profile some criminals.
[22:35.58]On account of my being a brilliant psychiatrist.
[22:41.36]Guess of all the criminals you knew, you'd be the one to ask.
[22:45.35]Hey!
[22:46.49]I am not a criminal.
[22:49.87]I'm misunderstood.
[22:51.17]She's got a board up there too.
[22:53.73]Look.
[22:55.61]You know what I'm here for.
[22:58.33]Hand it over.
[23:02.32]He just grabs the bars and he just rips the bars off the fucking wall and he's got the whole thing in his hands and just throws it behind him.
[23:09.03]but I'm missing my piece de resistance I need you to follow up on this here card that'll make it perfect nice it's hard to catch paper holy that's the most impressive thing that we've seen a superhero do for the last two days you're not making this easy for me it should be down in records okay
[23:39.61]Bye.
[23:59.20]OK.
[24:01.82]Exit cell block 3.
[24:02.82]Is we gonna go get whatever this is?
[24:04.80]Clear the inmates from the corridor, alright?
[24:07.26]We got it.
[24:13.14]That guy's going to accidentally hit me in the head.
[24:29.97]Can he hit me in the head accidentally?
[24:33.88]He's going to hit me with his backswing.
[24:40.82]Oh, god damn it.
[24:49.75]I'm glitching out.
[24:50.87]I'm phasing out of reality.
[25:01.01]I can just get across?
[25:06.79]How do I...
[25:30.73]Alright, I'm good.
[25:34.65]Your camera's fucked up.
[25:35.39]What the heck's wrong with my camera?
[25:39.57]Why does it keep doing that?
[26:03.62]Dude, you need more RAM.
[26:04.60]Your V-Tuber model is... Holy shit.
[26:08.94]Okay.
[26:16.04]Oh my god.
[26:17.95]Okay.
[26:18.41]Momentum ability.
[26:19.29]Enemy armored attacks can only be entered with piercing abilities, such as Barrage.
[26:23.95]Gain momentum, and then... Okay, I have a new move.
[26:33.91]Holy shit, dude.
[26:35.63]I shot you like 50 times.
[26:55.61]Shoot behind you.
[26:56.49]Why am I not... I'm so stupid.
[26:58.37]I'm trying to aim...
[27:12.40]Geez.
[27:12.90]Alright, go.
[27:21.39]I'm going to get hit once.
[27:26.78]Mm-hmm.
[27:56.87]Oh!
[27:58.59]Another one!
[28:02.92]Oh my god, you're gonna get me in two hits.
[28:11.36]No, don't kill me!
[28:17.44]Oh my god.
[28:20.23]Crocs.
[28:25.27]Why would I have to defeat the guards?
[28:27.95]Really?
[28:29.55]No, why?
[28:30.03]Defeat the guards?
[28:30.81]I... Alright, fine.
[28:33.38]Okay, I'll defeat... You actually got a hit on me.
[28:43.76]Ha!
[29:10.56]The guards don't even have weapons.
[29:12.69]I know, this is so unfair.
[29:18.91]Come here.
[29:23.15]And a choke slam, that was fucking sick.
[29:37.66]Yeah, those guys had bare fists.
[29:45.46]I don't want anything to do with this.
[29:46.40]I have no more healing by the way, this is bad.
[29:55.08]Why would I even fight them?
[29:57.41]Alright.
[30:09.57]How do you get more heals?
[30:10.47]Are they just consumables?
[30:13.10]Ooh, chest.
[30:13.42]Can you stealth take down the big enemies?
[30:53.90]He fell down.
[30:54.46]Turn around.
[31:13.49]Turn around!
[31:18.45]Unload, unload, unload, unload!
[31:45.87]I'm trying to get the perfect strikes.
[31:47.15]It's hard to do with Red Hood.
[32:04.06]Don't let him put the shield up.
[32:06.04]Aww.
[32:19.43]Low the difficulty.
[32:20.33]No, no, it's gonna stay at hard.
[32:26.42]Alright records room.
[32:32.52]Shoot them when they have the red flashing.
[32:36.08]Come on Harley, you're too smart to just send me on an errand after an old file.
[32:41.21]What do you want me to find out?
[32:44.99]You're a hard gamer.
[32:46.07]Yeah.
[32:48.49]I play games on hard.
[32:50.07]No, actually I kind of don't.
[32:55.78]Oh, chest over there.
[33:04.03]They're bullet spongy on hard.
[33:07.05]It's got to get better weapons.
[33:13.41]Find and examine marked items.
[33:14.83]Okay.
[33:20.43]Prisoner profile.
[33:21.73]Cyrus Gold.
[33:22.64]Convict, they say.
[33:23.68]Crook, they say.
[33:24.56]Murderer, they say.
[33:25.76]But soon, peace will be mine.
[33:27.58]Died on Saturday.
[33:28.44]Buried on Sunday.
[33:29.30]Born on Monday.
[33:30.12]They have no... Oh, I thought this was like a poem.
[33:34.32]Is it?
[33:34.56]Is it?
[33:51.49]I don't have a lot of patience anymore.
[33:57.28]Harley, how did you get access to the PA system?
[34:09.29]She's just on the PA.
[34:15.91]OK, there we go.
[34:19.27]Scan the card catalog.
[34:31.32]Index locations of all documents stored in the records room.
[34:35.76]OK.
[34:39.64]OK, look at the stuff here.
[34:41.18]Over there.
[34:48.48]Can I open that?
[34:52.58]Analyze.
[34:54.82]Here's what Harley was looking for.
[34:57.55]Here's your documents, Harley.
[35:00.95]I think I found out all I can about this case.
[35:03.85]I wonder what Harley will have to say about it.
[35:05.73]I'm going to open the door.
[35:07.78]This is a boss.
[35:11.92]This has to be boss fight, right?
[35:13.10]I'm going to be fighting.
[35:28.07]What the hell does Harley want from this file?
[35:31.30]Harley's mind is amazed, but it's still amazing.
[35:34.94]She must have a good reason.
[35:36.78]She's going to open the door.
[35:37.56]She can take it from me and she's going to go like.
[35:39.64]I can't do a Harley Quinn impression, but it's going to be something like.
[35:43.14]How?
[35:46.08]I can't do a Harley Quinn impression.
[35:56.57]Good job everyone made things even worse.
[36:02.04]What are they even fighting?
[36:02.90]Alright.
[36:07.34]Is this getting his head bashed in with a bat?
[36:12.09]Look at how many times.
[36:14.13]This is awful!
[36:18.81]Oh my god!
[36:35.98]I'm coming.
[36:38.10]Relax.
[36:40.96]Do something?
[36:41.58]What do you mean, do something?
[36:43.24]I'm not supposed to protect every single citizen.
[36:47.79]That's the title of the stream.
[36:48.75]Never mind.
[37:25.44]Why are they all fighting each other?
[37:33.30]Alright, this guy is just throwing lit toilet paper out the fucking window.
[37:45.79]You guys are gonna be real pissed off once somebody in this prison has to take a shit.
[37:55.95]Larry, did you have to throw 200 rolls of toilet paper?
[37:58.57]You can just throw one or two.
[38:02.75]They're all doing it.
[38:10.28]You're back.
[38:12.04]And I got you what you wanted.
[38:13.14]Gibby.
[38:27.66]Please talk more.
[38:59.07]Seriously?
[39:00.57]Do I look like I'm 12 to you?
[39:08.74]I do these movements.
[39:09.58]I do this like in the kitchen.
[39:14.28]Oh, is the pizza here?
[39:16.20]All available guards to red block.
[39:18.73]Play nice.
[39:25.87]What?

[39:43.64]Where did it go?

[40:06.47]What is it?
[40:07.03]Where's the music coming from?
[40:13.13]Why am I doing this shit?

[40:29.49]Just shoot the balloon down!
[40:42.62]I don't even know who I'm attacking.
[40:44.28]I'm just fighting random people.
[40:55.41]What the fuck was that?
[40:57.01]Hey!
[40:57.63]Alright, I have to do that though.
[41:08.78]I have to do that.
[41:09.62]I actually have to fight them.
[41:15.12]I'm just going to stay back.
[41:35.58]Who's throwing the lit toilet paper?
[41:37.44]Because you're dead first.
[41:39.10]It's you.

[42:20.52]Just, just, oh, fuck, dude, I got somebody.
[42:23.12]Just pretend to be fighting.
[42:23.82]No one's going to fight both of us.

[42:27.78]Oh, you piece of shit.

[43:00.09]I'm killing everybody in here.
[43:01.75]No more messing around.
[43:03.75]I got hit directly.
[43:04.81]Alright.

[43:27.79]Alright, goodbye.
[43:44.76]Oh shit!
[43:59.14]Crazy.
[44:02.57]That guy's just taunting.
[44:04.71]No, fuck you, man.
[44:05.51]Get out of the server.
[44:06.31]Let somebody else play.
[44:09.75]There's three people trying to queue up to this place.
[44:11.59]Come on.
[44:18.46]You thought you were going to hit me, didn't you?
[44:28.25]I guess this guy's on fire.
[44:38.72]I completely missed.
[44:41.92]Dude, are you seriously sitting there calling me a vigilante right now?
[45:04.79]I'm going to have to fight two huge people.
[45:19.36]Nice teamwork.
[45:20.29]You and me.
[45:20.77]You and me.
[45:21.07]You and me.
[45:40.39]Uh-oh, there's only two left.
[45:42.64]Don't kill me, please!
[45:44.80]No!
[45:51.26]Shit!
[45:53.48]Oh, god damn it!
[45:55.24]Oh my god, I got fucking whirlwinded.
[46:01.51]Shit!
[46:02.27]Oh, I'm actually fucking pissed.
[46:03.87]I'm gonna turn it down to medium.
[46:05.23]I'm gonna turn it down to medium.
[46:06.21]I'm turning it down to medium.
[46:07.13]I'm sorry, I'm turning it to medium.
[46:08.99]It's way too hard for me.
[46:17.73]Just for this part.
[46:18.49]Just for this part.
[46:19.65]I don't have... I didn't find any good... I have to craft gear.
[46:27.16]I was playing with Nightwing the whole game.
[46:28.60]I don't have any items for fucking Red Hood.
[46:49.84]Unlock.
[46:53.08]Oh, hell yeah, that was perfect.
[46:59.46]Perfect.
[47:05.18]Alright, we're fighting two different fights just crossing into each other.
[47:14.31]Why did that guy fall?
[47:22.43]Don't you dare kill me on medium.
[47:36.96]No!
[47:37.72]No!
[47:40.08]No, please.
[47:42.38]You're so much more powerful than me.
[47:44.18]It's not fair.
[47:45.30]You're...
[47:53.81]Well, per the rules of the superhero agreements, you are now part of the Gotham Knights.
[47:59.99]Congratulations.
[48:01.69]Oh my fucking God.
[48:02.70]That was so fucking funny.
[48:05.30]Dude, you suck.
[48:06.10]I'm doing fine.
[48:07.96]I'm doing just fine.
[48:15.22]Alright.
[48:18.74]Look, she's destroying people.
[48:20.90]I'm just staying back.
[48:31.54]Fucking idiot!
[48:32.30]Why would you... Get him!
[48:33.81]Kill him, not me.
[48:34.65]Why would you do that?
[48:46.59]I'll be back later.
[48:47.91]I'll be back... Don't!
[49:12.30]Dude, I feel like I'm playing this out with a Royal Rumble.
[49:31.20]No, not on the rematch.
[49:44.13]Please die, thank God, thank God, thank God.
[49:47.37]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[49:59.21]Ow.
[50:07.34]Alright, let's go.
[50:13.13]Swing.
[50:14.71]Swing at me.
[50:15.63]Swing at me.
[50:17.99]Fucking dumbass.
[50:23.25]What's going on?
[50:23.74]Oh, I had to reload.
[50:25.16]I mean, don't have fun without me.
[50:38.73]Watch out.
[50:39.13]Watch out.
[50:39.47]Big guy coming in.
[51:12.41]Okay.
[51:13.55]I did it.
[51:18.74]I did it.
[51:24.26]Wait, the room is... The camera is glitching and showing other parts of my room.
[51:29.39]That's fucking hilarious.
[51:36.56]What the fuck is going on with my camera?
[51:41.14]It's like putting my chin down here.
[51:43.98]Like this.
[51:48.09]Dude, we can see your... No, you can't.
[52:04.10]Okay, we're good.
[52:14.72]What is it?
[52:16.06]Oh, it's... Okay, I see what it's doing.
[52:17.64]That's fucking funny.
[52:20.58]It's... What the fuck?
[52:28.59]Alright, let me go pee.
[52:29.75]Let me pee first.
[52:30.41]I'll be right back.
[52:33.58]I haven't peed.
[57:07.92]Okay.
[57:20.05]That was fucking funny.
[57:21.43]That was fun.
[57:23.19]I'd be lying to you if I didn't think that was an incredibly enjoyable experience.
[57:28.33]Alright, so what is going on with my webcam?
[57:33.01]Like, honest to God, why is it like freaking out?
[57:37.50]Why is it freaking out?
[57:38.30]It doesn't make any sense.
[57:43.30]Help us.
[57:50.22]Yeah, it seems to only happen with, I don't know, it's something to do with how it's pulling in through OBS.
[57:54.38]I don't know.
[58:03.26]Should I plug it back in?
[58:09.61]Was this happening yesterday?
[58:10.51]I don't remember this happening yesterday.
[58:12.75]I remember it was glitching yesterday, but it was like teleporting around the room.
[58:43.02]Bet you can't even remember what you were eating yesterday.
[58:45.17]I do.
[58:46.99]I remember.
[58:54.92]The crime weapon.
[59:05.52]Your camera's having an out-of-body experience.
[59:26.95]Well, I'm sorry that's happening.
[59:28.97]It really shouldn't be.
[59:32.73]But I'm going to turn it back on.
[59:44.17]We still freaking out.
[59:50.44]OK.
[59:53.36]Miss me.
[59:54.87]Alright, that was fun.
[59:56.89]Keep moving.
[59:57.71]It's your hair.
[60:24.81]I just did.
[60:29.01]Alright, so I get my... I get my shit back.
[60:34.96]Change it back to hard?
[60:35.84]No.
[60:36.00]Alright.
[60:53.27]I'm just gonna teleport back.
[60:56.04]That was a wild mission.
[61:02.48]I'm gonna, yeah, I'll keep it on medium.
[61:03.92]Yeah.
[61:11.55]The AI reconstruction of your room.
[61:20.79]Why is there like another person?
[61:29.63]There's another person here.
[61:31.48]Hold on.
[61:35.84]I want to see what this looks like.
[61:56.80]Let's see.
[62:01.99]So this is an AI of the room.
[62:07.00]AI recreated the room.
[62:09.72]Why is it?
[62:10.96]What's the opacity for?
[62:12.38]Oh, right.
[62:24.35]This looks like you took this picture in a submarine.
[62:28.69]Like this is my submarine streamer room.
[62:33.31]Yeah, why is there another person over here?
[62:43.34]What is that?
[62:51.22]I don't know.
[62:54.05]Alright, well, interesting.
[62:57.81]I think maybe it thinks that's a mirror.
[63:01.51]Right?
[63:11.25]I imagine that's probably what it thinks.
[63:22.56]It's evil.
[63:24.28]I don't know.
[63:24.70]I have no idea, man.
[63:35.59]I think my OBS is crashing.
[63:39.63]What happened to my thing?
[63:48.28]Oh, there it is.
[63:51.72]I mean, I could just unplug the webcam and go without cam for a little while.
[63:55.62]If it's that annoying.
[63:59.36]But, whatever.
[64:00.68]One crime stopped today.
[64:05.77]Not zero.
[64:09.33]At least one.
[64:09.99]Alright, talk to Alfred.
[64:17.85]We focus on a prominent and often controversial figure, Oswald Cobblepot.
[64:24.11]Thinking about what happened at Blackgate, Master Jason?
[64:27.84]I can't believe Harley got away.
[64:30.04]She played us, and I'm sure she's got more shit planned.
[64:33.98]She hasn't left any other messages or maps.
[64:36.96]Do you have any leads on where she might have gone?
[64:39.78]Not really, but the Freaks are usually our partners in crime.
[64:44.18]A good place to start, then.
[64:51.79]Okay.
[64:53.89]Unloading clues.
[64:57.23]Open the book and examine the evidence.
[64:58.71]Is it up here?
[65:00.04]There it is.
[65:00.34]Let's take a look.
[65:22.17]Now she's involved.
[65:27.01]How did I miss this?
[65:29.21]Oh, right.
[65:29.69]Harley's stupid system makes no sense.
[65:32.62]Babs.
[65:42.47]Hey, Babs, what did you figure out?
[65:45.30]They all got out on a peel.
[65:48.04]That's what Harley was tracking.
[65:50.42]In every case, key witnesses were murdered.
[65:53.94]Look.
[65:55.20]They were all pinned up with knives.
[65:58.43]Just like Langstrom.
[66:01.17]Bruce is onto something.
[66:03.37]Oh?
[66:05.17]I think I've got something.
[66:09.31]Oswald Cobblepot.
[66:10.54]The Penguin.
[66:11.90]He's like everyone else in here.
[66:14.48]except he served his sentence every single time he was arrested.
[66:19.72]Someone must have hung him out to dry.
[66:21.28]Might be he's willing to talk.
[66:24.56]He runs the Iceberg Lounge now.
[66:26.54]Claims he went legit.
[66:28.28]He definitely runs more than liquor through that bar.
[66:31.42]I wouldn't know.
[66:32.54]That man would never take me.
[66:34.68]If you wanted a fake ID, Tim, all you had to do was ask.
[66:40.96]Oswald's dangerous.
[66:43.20]So we're going after the penguin?
[66:44.12]Alright.
[67:15.05]Reach the Iceberg Lounge.
[67:17.07]We got it.
[67:17.41]Let me see what we got.
[67:21.29]Should I do some more, just like, crime fighting?
[67:23.01]I feel like I should.
[67:26.79]Secret Identity Compromise.
[67:28.67]Protecting Batman's secret identity is vital to protecting Bruce Wayne's legacy.
[67:32.86]Reach a specified location and plant fake information, giving Bruce Wayne an alibi.
[67:37.68]If you're caught, you won't be able to plant the fake info again.
[67:40.38]Until the next night.
[67:43.74]Really?
[67:44.00]Okay.
[67:50.98]I'm getting overexposed here too.
[67:52.71]Go like this.
[67:54.63]I need to at least do like one or two.
[67:59.77]I have to do at least a couple.
[68:02.31]Like crime stopping things.
[68:17.19]Let me drop the gamma on this.
[68:19.78]It's a little too overexposed.
[68:29.24]That's better.
[68:31.43]That's better.
[68:32.15]Okay, reach Iceberg Lounge.
[68:39.93]What else is there?
[68:46.53]Only one of Gotham's rich and powerful has served actual prison time.
[68:49.77]Oswald Cobblepot, aka the Penguin.
[68:52.07]Name of visit.
[68:54.39]Okay.
[68:55.67]I think I have a point to put in.
[68:56.97]I do.
[69:01.25]Crit damage, 20%.
[69:09.38]What's the second thing on the third tier here?
[69:13.03]Every round Red Hood shoots has a small chance to deal five times the damage.
[69:17.43]Only applies to ranged attacks and precision aim.
[69:19.73]Okay.
[69:22.51]I need... I'm not going to do anything.
[69:23.57]I need two points.
[69:34.25]Again, this is a sponsored segment of the stream.
[69:37.64]This is sponsored by Warner Brothers.
[69:41.02]Gotham Knights is currently available right now on Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PC, which I'm playing on right now with a 3090.
[69:50.94]It's an open-world game.
[69:54.70]You can play as four different characters in the Batman universe.
[70:01.27]Currently playing as Red Hood.
[70:02.91]Here's full co-op.
[70:07.35]Pretty cool.
[70:17.33]Make the webcam bigger.
[70:18.13]It's too small.
[70:19.80]Better take a different way in.
[70:22.78]Like Batman would.
[70:23.42]Go up in the roof.
[70:44.39]Let me take a look.
[70:45.05]Hold on.
[70:45.55]Let me see what it looks like.
[70:53.42]Okay, cool.
[70:54.40]Let's go beat up the penguin.
[70:55.70]Let's punch him in the face a million times.
[71:03.80]Wait, co-op is actually kind of nice.
[71:04.94]There's like three co-op games.
[71:07.86]Yeah, I think the whole purpose of the game is to jump in with a friend and just run around and solve crimes and stuff.
[71:16.94]Yeah, it's all co-op.
[71:20.20]Alright, talk to the penguin.
[71:23.58]Is he just in here?
[71:24.74]Is this like the penguin's club?
[71:55.78]Something's definitely... Shut up.
[72:04.61]What?
[72:08.77]Was that a quiet?
[72:10.25]Alright, that was silent apparently.
[72:14.91]You're where club.
[72:16.49]Alright, I just got one more guard.
[72:24.57]Alright, go down.
[72:41.88]Whoops.
[72:49.80]I pressed the wrong button.
[72:57.81]I pressed the wrong button.
[73:04.25]No, no, no, no, no!
[73:04.87]Don't follow me!
[73:05.27]You psycho!
[73:23.79]Alright, just get... I can do that too, you know.
[73:30.67]I need to do a silent takedown.
[73:31.71]I gotta drop aggro.
[73:35.95]Don't let him grab you!
[73:40.22]Hey, he's running!
[73:51.58]I got to drop aggro.
[73:52.31]I got to drop aggro.
[73:53.15]I want to get the bonus.
[73:56.79]No, who cares?
[73:57.53]I'm going to just get you.
[74:01.55]How did you do that?
[74:31.03]Penguin's office?
[74:31.65]Can I grapple anything?
[74:38.75]Yeah.
[74:45.42]Of course it's locked.
[74:47.22]Really?
[74:48.62]Never mind.
[74:51.10]That door's sandalwood.
[74:52.47]Custom job.
[74:54.32]Fixing it's gonna be a pain in the ass.
[74:56.22]Yeah, just answer my questions and I won't break anything else.
[74:59.98]Smile.
[75:01.94]Viral video of you assaulting reformed citizen is the last thing you need right now.
[75:08.59]Reformed?
[75:13.55]Guess all that time in Blackgate did the trick.
[75:17.09]Funny how you weren't able to weasel out of it like so many of your pals.
[75:21.23]That is actually cool that everybody has their own dialogue.
[75:23.51]They have to record four different sessions.
[75:24.97]That's cool.
[75:25.27]Penguin, which Gotham bad guy do you think you are?
[75:27.61]I think I'm the Joker.
[75:51.85]You're not worth my time.
[75:55.01]Get lost.
[76:05.20]Because I'm the Riddler.
[76:06.46]That's who I think I am.
[76:12.28]I can't just grab him and smash, smash, smash his head against the desk?
[76:28.36]Ooh, chess.
[76:31.62]Oh wait, maybe he does think he's the Riddler.
[76:41.75]Guns.
[76:46.55]Wait, what is this painting? ...
[77:14.08]Okay.
[77:15.66]Well, that's cool that we get to actually meet Penguin there.
[77:17.76]I don't get to punch him in the face.
[77:24.33]Is Penguin that old?
[77:26.23]I mean, I think Bruce Wayne looked a little older in this.
[77:32.32]He looked like he was older.
[77:33.70]So I think this takes place maybe a little bit later.
[77:47.33]Yeah, well.
[77:50.81]Alright, turn to the bell.
[77:51.47]No, no, I'm not doing that.
[77:54.03]I'm going to stop some crimes.
[77:56.13]I'm not going to be zero crime prevented Andy.
[77:59.62]We're stopping some crimes.
[78:15.93]Otherwise, am I even a superhero at this point?
[78:17.97]Like, I need to protect the community and stuff.
[78:21.35]So I'm going to... Let's go.
[78:26.32]This one's right here.
[78:28.34]There's some people stealing shit over here.
[78:47.41]Okay.
[78:48.83]Let's do it.
[79:00.98]What's up?
[79:01.62]What's this huge guy?
[79:03.25]He's got like a jet pack on.
[79:24.41]Holy OK.
[79:25.13]It's like electricity guy.
[79:44.57]No.
[79:53.23]I didn't get it off.
[79:53.85]Shit.
[79:58.21]Ow!
[80:12.36]Alright.
[80:15.58]Crime stopped.
[80:17.34]I did it.
[80:19.50]I prevented the crime.
[80:24.33]Let me do one more.
[80:28.31]There's a big one going on over there.
[80:30.01]I need one behind me.
[80:32.35]There's a chest over there.
[80:36.63]I need to do at least two.
[80:37.51]Should I get the chest?
[80:44.73]I want that chest.
[80:45.39]I'm getting it.
[80:50.57]Check your gear upgrades.
[80:57.03]Holy shit.
[80:58.85]44 defense.
[81:15.53]This thing's pretty sick.
[81:21.07]I wonder how many outfits there are for each character.
[81:25.19]That's, this is... I must have just run up by a car.
[81:30.52]You don't, oh, they don't recognize me because I'm in a different costume.
[81:32.62]It's me, the Red Hood.
[81:34.80]I'm trying a different look.
[81:35.70]I'm trying a new outfit.
[81:37.10]And I think it looks pretty good.
[81:39.22]It's equally scary, but equally, I have authority.
[81:43.23]And I have... You don't want to take a picture for Instagram or anything?
[81:53.53]You would've taken a picture with fuckin' Batman, wouldn't you?
[82:01.65]Alright, here we go.
[82:12.90]Straight ahead.
[82:14.00]Prime in progress.
[82:15.00]Stop where you are!
[82:23.93]I'm on it.
[82:29.78]Stop.
[82:33.30]Stop.
[82:35.22]It's me.
[82:48.13]I reloaded and shot him.
[82:52.22]I actually like this outfit.
[82:57.49]Alright, Prime.
[83:02.52]Prime stopped.
[83:03.28]That counts, right?
[83:18.66]Oh, there's another one right here.
[83:21.39]Right down the street.
[83:35.18]How did I just get in here?
[83:40.51]Where am I?
[83:40.97]Am I in the sewers?
[83:42.09]How did I get in here?
[83:48.09]There's a loot box down here.
[83:49.27]Yeah, there is.
[83:51.17]I'll get it.
[83:51.51]Is this a loot box?
[83:57.44]What is this?
[84:05.06]That was not a loot box.
[84:07.61]Criminal activity.
[84:08.79]I didn't do anything.
[84:09.65]I didn't prevent any crimes.
[84:12.93]I think they have to be the big ones.
[84:20.90]Alright, let's keep it rolling.
[84:21.92]Let's keep it rolling.
[84:30.96]All the AI images.
[84:31.76]Yeah, they're looking fucking weird.
[84:43.17]You didn't prevent anything, you were just killing people.
[84:44.93]Alright, what do you got, Alpha?
[84:51.43]Penguin kept his mouth shut.
[84:53.34]Batman made this stuff look easy.
[84:56.26]You may be surprised to learn Batman struggled with similar challenges early in his career.
[85:01.94]So for a time, he focused his energies elsewhere in the city.
[85:06.40]When word of his work got out, people were more inclined to cooperate.
[85:12.57]City we've been so wrapped up in Batman's last case.
[85:16.03]We ignored the rest of Gotham Gotham may not know I always feel like red hood is about to punch it.
[85:22.26]It's whoever he's talking to his absence There has been a marked increase in gang-related crime Plus whatever shit penguins up to these days.
[85:32.82]Maybe if we mess with him and because he is crooks.
[85:35.58]He'll feel like talking I
[85:37.92]You've also received messages from Lucius Fox and detective Montoya.
[85:42.92]They may be able to help.
[85:45.46]Thanks Alfred.
[85:46.16]Yes.
[85:47.30]It's time to take a page out of Batman's book.
[85:51.10]I promise.
[85:51.80]It's an excellent read.
[85:54.04]Okay.
[85:57.50]New email.
[86:00.45]Oh my God.
[86:00.81]I have not.
[86:03.89]I mean, I've,
[86:07.82]I haven't read any of these.
[86:09.24]Batman sent me a fucking email?
[86:11.70]What?
[86:12.50]I got an email from Batman.
[86:17.86]If you receive this message, then people have started linking the words Bruce Wayne and Batman online.
[86:22.57]Which means my identity... He knows that people are searching.
[86:28.47]As you might understand.
[86:29.65]The Google Trends search...
[86:33.19]is looking like Bruce Wayne and Batman together.
[86:35.61]I'm seeing a lot more of those in October of 2022.
[86:38.55]Okay, so... Sorry I missed the email, Batman.
[86:52.66]Our PR problem?
[86:54.66]We have a reputation problem.
[86:59.01]What with citizens of Gotham running at the very sight of us and the GCPD hating our guts, Mr. Dorius, my history teacher, used to say, people fear what they don't understand.
[87:07.99]I think I've come up with the perfect solution to our PR problem.
[87:10.65]We start a podcast.
[87:15.48]No.
[87:18.26]Now, now, let's not be so quick to judge.
[87:20.22]What exactly are you proposing to him?
[87:25.12]I haven't gotten quite that far yet.
[87:26.38]Maybe it's the four of us debunking myths about what we do or debriefing our latest case.
[87:31.06]We could answer listener questions.
[87:33.38]We call it podcast nights or bat chat.
[87:35.88]We can workshop the name, but I think it's a good idea.
[87:38.74]We even already have fun interpersonal dynamics and banter, which is the perfect for audio.
[87:44.10]No.
[87:45.74]See, we're already doing it.
[87:46.74]Whenever you're being a party pooper, I'll just be like classic Red Hood.
[87:50.92]People will love it.
[87:51.77]We could do t-shirts.
[88:07.56]I'm playing as Robin.
[88:09.82]I'm gonna play as Robin.
[88:10.62]In today's Gotham Minute, we focus on a prominent and often controversial figure, Oswald Cobblepot.
[88:17.59]The most infamous, if not famous, member of Gotham's long-established... An encrypted message from Foxteka.
[88:23.41]It's Lucius.
[88:27.97]Sorry I've been a ghost since the funeral.
[88:30.39]But I just realized I forgot to send flowers.
[88:34.32]If you're ever in the neighborhood, let's meet in my building.
[88:38.14]I'd like to give you them in person.
[88:43.94]Lucius Fox wants to give us flowers.
[88:46.82]Does he know couriers exist?
[88:49.42]Knowing Lucius, I suspect he has something far more useful for us.
[88:54.05]Okay.
[88:54.87]When you reach Fox Decker, head straight to the roof.
[89:03.34]Check the evidence board.
[89:05.14]Nightwing is fun.
[89:05.90]Red Hood is fun, too.
[89:07.78]Watch.
[89:07.98]I'm going to play as Robin.
[89:08.86]It's going to be my fairy character.
[89:10.10]Okay.
[89:15.87]I got some new stuff here.
[89:20.03]Penguin's criminal deal.
[89:22.65]Penguin's organ trafficking.
[89:26.93]Lucius Fox.
[89:28.11]Detective Montoya.
[89:29.05]Okay.
[89:29.65]Okay.
[89:32.74]There's a lot of stuff to do.
[89:35.92]Harley returns.
[89:37.82]Freaks have been teaming up with some unexpected allies.
[89:39.84]Investigate their crimes to find out what's going on.
[89:41.44]Alright, we got to do some interrogations.
[89:44.01]Okay.
[89:55.91]Time to patrol Gotham City.
[89:57.07]I want... What do I want to track?

[90:10.41]Because there's... Harley?
[90:24.48]Penguin?
[90:25.08]I've seen a lot of people say... Let me just see who has a cooler potential plan here.
[90:30.67]Yeah.
[90:31.45]So, let me see.
[90:34.51]Stop a criminal deal to interfere with the Penguin's activities in Gotham City.
[90:37.65]So, that's like, that's a Penguin marker.

[91:08.26]I was just thinking of that time we all made dinner together and Tim got tomato sauce all over Bruce and Baz.
[91:15.60]I don't remember that.
[91:17.30]What?
[91:18.59]You have to.
[91:19.25]It was the same year.
[91:22.93]You know what?
[91:24.27]Never mind.
[91:26.01]Dumb story anyway.
[91:28.65]Well, I could tell you a story.
[91:31.23]It's about being dead, then brought back to life by a pit of mind-altering goo.
[91:37.37]Hey, I didn't mean... I don't know what's worse.
[91:41.03]Having a chunk of my life taken away from me, or coming back to everyone thinking I'm gonna snap... I'm sorry, Jason.
[91:53.41]We shouldn't have... I shouldn't have treated you like an outsider.

[92:23.24]You gotta clean and peel that thing.

[100:00.86]Alright.
[100:06.19]Make sure I interrogate somebody.
[100:07.63]It's really important.
[100:28.44]They put that wall there just so you would run into it.
[100:30.72]Should I just go?
[100:37.51]What if I went the speed limit?

[101:31.92]What do you know?
[101:32.48]What?
[101:32.64]Where's the container?
[102:04.48]Oh, that's a plaque.
[102:05.72]I have one minute?

[103:08.68]Do I give it to you?
[103:12.94]Alright, we're good.
[103:16.44]Dr. Tompkins, thanks for answering the call.
[103:19.69]Nothing surprises me anymore with these gangs.
[103:22.60]Thanks for the delivery.
[103:24.04]I've got a medical team lined up who can use it.
[103:26.92]Glad I got here in time, man.

[103:33.33]And is he pissed now?
[103:42.48]Wait.

[109:26.28]You gotta save the best for last.
[109:38.39]Save the best for last.
[109:50.35]Play as Alfred.
[109:51.43]I don't think you can play as Alfred.
[109:56.36]Alright, Batgirl.
[109:57.62]Expert Hacker.
[109:58.14]Let's do it.

[110:53.38]I know.
[110:55.30]I said, I think my teeth are falling out.
[111:00.72]Oh, Jesus.
[111:04.21]What the fuck?
[111:08.25]Alright, Batgirl.

[111:41.84]Different suits.
[111:43.78]Cool.
[111:45.24]I like this one.
[111:48.20]Okay, cool.
[111:51.10]Okay, well, it's definitely going to be this one.
[111:58.67]Tonfa.
[112:03.61]Cool.
[112:06.10]Alright.
[112:07.50]So let's do the, uh... Let's go this way.
[112:13.74]Gotham Knights.
[112:15.42]Available right now on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Series S. It's there.
[112:22.84]It came out today.
[112:24.92]Why are you so narrow?
[112:26.88]I'll fix my webcam when we play the scary game, okay?
[112:36.20]Open world.
[112:37.04]Here's the whole map.
[112:38.18]Co-op.
[112:39.04]The whole game.
[112:43.61]I'm closest to... I'm closest to Detective Montoya.
[112:47.89]We'll mark that.
[112:48.69]Let's check out... Oh, I need to do points.
[112:56.40]Justice, Grit, or Oracle.
[113:01.40]Using AR mode, Batgirl can disable certain devices like cameras, turrets, and mines.
[113:05.24]That's pretty amazing.
[113:08.54]Increases Batgirl's base house by 40%.
[113:10.52]That seems amazing.
[113:14.97]Or, uh, Perfect Divide.
[113:16.85]I feel like I want that.
[113:19.73]Uh, always start with Perfect Divide.
[113:26.39]Critical damage.
[113:28.03]Defense.
[113:30.50]What is down this tree?
[113:32.26]Overcharge an enemy's gun or device, instantly applying a bioelectric elemental effect.
[113:43.84]Most enemy attacks can't interrupt Batgirl's heavy melee attack.
[113:47.48]That's pretty good.
[113:51.01]Batgirl can revive herself once after her health is depleted.
[113:54.23]Okay, we're doing this tree.
[113:59.89]No interruptions or... This one's like defense, right?
[114:06.04]Batgirl receives a 75% defense bonus when hit by an enemy counterattack.
[114:10.26]We'll go with this one.
[114:10.76]I can get them both.
[114:14.73]Yeah.
[114:16.47]Self-revive will be good.
[114:19.11]Okay.
[114:21.57]Alright.
[114:24.07]Go.
[114:26.53]I like the cable.
[114:56.97]cape c-a-p-e cape
[115:32.26]Whoa.
[115:34.62]It's scary every time.
[115:50.07]Alright, here we are.
[115:50.95]Hi.
[115:51.09]What do you got?
[115:55.79]Some kind of mission?
[115:58.20]Christ, don't you sneak up on me like that.
[116:01.56]I actually kind of did.
[116:03.18]Not the bad I was expecting to see, but if he trusts you, so will I. Likewise.
[116:09.76]I assume you've got something in mind.
[116:12.76]Fill me in.
[116:14.68]Well, since we lost Gordon, some cops are back to playing dirty again.
[116:20.07]Kane doesn't like it, but she's not doing much to stop it either.
[116:25.01]So I've heard.
[116:26.43]She's not half the commissioner he was.
[116:29.65]I know Batman was helping Gordon clean up the force, but now any cops who used to be on Gordon's team are getting their asses handed to them.
[116:38.07]The gangs are ambushing them because they won't take bribes, and dispatchers are giving them the worst assignments because they make trouble for everyone else.
[116:46.71]Hoping the gangs will do their dirty work for them.
[116:49.34]That's... horrible.
[116:53.04]Look, I hate to ask, but can you keep an eye on cops when they're facing off against the gangs?
[116:59.13]Watch out.
[116:59.49]Let's go.
[117:24.07]OK, side activity complete.
[117:25.91]Contacts offer tasks to help clean up and protect Gotham City.
[117:28.79]Help various contacts during controls to earn distinct rewards.
[117:35.86]OK, hey, you save someone's life out there.
[117:39.84]So now we gotta go talk to.
[117:42.74]Box.
[117:47.99]Oh, there's a bat about that memory or something.
[117:54.81]Oh, I gotta, I gotta, my webcam's gotta go off for this.
[117:58.26]These are cutscenes.
[118:37.18]The game's multiplayer?
[118:38.00]It is multiplayer.
[118:39.10]The whole thing.
[118:39.50]The whole thing's co-op.
[118:46.99]Wait, did we... We do...
[119:04.24]I keep waiting for him to step down and, I don't know, give some inspiring speech.
[119:09.30]Tell us to get back to work.
[119:11.44]Maybe he didn't think I was sticking around.
[119:12.86]You would have hated this.
[119:16.56]They put you on an actual damn pedestal.
[119:21.10]Maybe he'd understand.
[119:22.32]They always said people needed symbols.
[119:29.05]Something to believe in.
[119:32.13]Yeah.
[119:33.27]...but we both know he meant you bats.
[119:37.72]Not him... ...except with a squared up jawline and... ...better glasses.
[119:43.90]They changed his face?
[119:46.02]Yeah... ...it's hard to tell from here, but... ...it looks nothing like him.
[119:55.29]Wish we had him back.
[119:57.21]Yeah... ...me too.
[120:05.77]See you later, Jim.
[120:10.49]That girl.
[120:21.16]He looks just like I remember.
[120:29.24]So that yeah, so that's a. They're the.
[120:35.44]Yeah, there's like little things around the city you can activate cutscenes and stuff.
[120:41.95]Let me link this.
[120:43.55]There we go.
[120:46.67]Hi.
[120:54.61]Okay.
[120:55.43]So, I need to go to Lucius, who is down here.
[120:59.81]He's pretty far away, isn't he?
[121:03.47]Kind of.
[121:09.26]Am I lazy and teleport back here and then go?
[121:11.97]No, we got a crime right here.
[121:13.11]I'm going to do this one.
[121:14.05]I also want to learn some moveset stuff with Batgirl.
[121:29.97]Yeah, we'll open up tomorrow with Batgirl.
[121:38.26]Well, the game, I mean.
[121:39.60]We'll stream something else for the first couple of hours.
[121:44.70]What is happening here?
[121:46.74]Investigate the crime scene.
[121:49.44]Okay.
[121:54.77]Oh, boy.
[121:55.09]This person is dead on the ground.
[121:59.65]What happened?
[122:02.51]Okay.
[122:08.02]Let's investigate.
[122:15.94]Oh my goodness.
[122:16.96]Find five clues to learn what happened.
[122:20.95]Got shot in the chest.
[122:23.99]Okay.
[122:27.29]Holding a ring.
[122:31.83]Power workers union ring.
[122:33.58]Must have belonged to the victim.
[122:34.72]The motive of this crime was likely not monetary.
[122:42.75]Notebook.
[122:44.43]It says data and notes on power boxes.
[122:50.13]Ammo type is too common to trace.
[122:54.45]Positive ID on the victim of Gotham City worker reported missing in recent weeks.
[122:57.62]The regulators likely tried to glean information from him about the city power grid.
[123:01.22]Okay.
[123:07.71]Which clue points to the current location of the suspects?
[123:15.39]Wait, what?
[123:15.65]We're gonna go to the power grid, right?
[123:31.81]Discover what happened and where the suspects are hiding.
[123:36.63]Which clue points to the current location?
[123:38.54]Oh, okay, okay.
[123:41.60]I get it.
[123:41.86]I have to select the clue.
[123:43.20]So it's the power box shit.
[123:46.14]Yeah.
[123:51.95]And... That's it, right?
[123:54.31]Solve it.
[123:55.47]Wait, it's not?
[124:00.35]Gunpowder residue.
[124:01.37]Wouldn't this say it's where the location... Where they are?
[124:11.12]The ring?
[124:13.42]Oh, right.
[124:13.92]No.
[124:14.92]No.
[124:17.07]Not correct.
[124:24.87]Gunpowder?
[124:29.13]Oh, alright.
[124:31.24]Crime resolved?
[124:34.28]Oh, I was going to say, we didn't find him.
[124:37.92]Okay, so now where are you?
[124:41.84]Over here.
[124:43.74]Is this it?
[124:48.73]Illegal hacking.
[124:52.37]Criminal in hiding.
[124:53.43]Alright, we'll do this and then we'll go wrap around to Lucius.
[124:56.69]Is the camera still fucking up?
[124:59.87]Is my camera still freaking out all the time or is it not bad right now?
[125:06.58]Not really.
[125:06.94]Yeah, I can see your bald spot.
[125:11.94]Oh, that's alright.
[125:17.49]Okay.
[125:23.70]I'm going to try to see why that's happening.
[125:25.98]I'll do some troubleshooting tonight.
[125:28.08]So tomorrow doesn't happen.
[125:32.58]Let's go track this person down.
[125:34.74]I don't have a bald spot.
[125:41.69]Look.
[125:43.45]I'll go like this.
[125:44.09]Look.
[126:21.17]Alright, so who's the killer?
[126:42.99]Okay, reach the hideout.
[126:54.18]Oh my god, there you are.
[126:55.50]Alright, you're on... No, oh!
[127:05.60]Beat two enemies at the same time.
[127:08.24]Defeat with momentum abilities.
[127:10.14]What's with their voices?
[127:40.62]Holy shit.
[127:54.17]Alright.
[127:54.67]That girl's pretty cool.
[127:58.50]I hope you like the back of a police cruiser.
[128:29.73]nice they're not getting up anytime soon I did it alright now lucius there you are made some pretty good progress I think
[128:59.88]Where's my car?
[129:06.22]I think you can just summon the car.
[129:08.02]It just appears.
[129:08.84]It's just ready.
[129:15.99]How many beers do you think you can drink in an hour?
[129:21.31]I don't know.
[129:26.33]One?
[129:26.43]Who cares?
[129:40.27]Alright.
[129:41.39]Cutscene!
[129:58.84]No place like it, is there, Mr. Fox?
[130:06.47]You trying to give me another heart attack?
[130:10.46]You got a computer up here?
[130:42.67]This is not a secure place to be doing work up here like this kind of secret work.
[130:52.84]You mentor and I always knew that something like this could happen.
[130:56.58]When I left Wayne Tech.
[130:58.90]We kept some research going.
[131:01.80]There are a lot of eyes on you now.
[131:04.18]No one's looking at Fox Tech.
[131:05.51]Rain's gonna ruin that computer.
[131:07.21]As long as I get a break between the guilds, you'll still have everything you need to carry on Batman's legacy.
[131:14.43]Speaking of which... Whoa.
[131:20.08]These flowers are gorgeous.
[131:22.54]It's Luke's design.
[131:24.72]A custom bird to help you get around a little quicker.
[131:27.92]Hefty enough to support exactly one hero.
[131:32.11]With this,
[131:33.94]The sky really is the limit.
[131:37.48]Now you can thank me.
[131:40.54]Thank you so much, Mr Fox.
[131:48.30]Do I actually get to fly this?
[131:53.28]Belfry, if this isn't enough to convince Penguin, nothing will be careful.
[131:59.44]Penguin is going to have an angle here.
[132:02.32]OK.
[132:04.28]Alright, we're going back to the launch.
[132:05.82]I'm dying to try this baby out.
[132:07.94]How do I start?
[132:08.63]You're getting ahead of yourself.
[132:11.99]Before you can use the bird, you'll have to clear a path for it.
[132:15.35]Clear a path?
[132:15.91]Whatever I need to do.
[132:18.21]Lately, the GCPD is not content to have jackboots on the ground.
[132:22.08]Somebody's shooting a machine gun.
[132:23.36]It lost a network of surveillance drones to patrol the skies.
[132:27.75]if they're looking for you when you try to get airborne.
[132:30.52]They won't hesitate to take me down.
[132:33.44]What do you recommend?
[132:35.88]A creative programmer could convince those drones to overlook certain targets.
[132:41.41]But for that to work, close-up scans would be required.
[132:47.21]For once, I'm not the one who has to handle the programming.
[132:50.91]I'll get you those scans, Mr Fox to solve crimes.
[132:54.12]The cops have the city divided into sectors.
[132:56.94]The set of drones watching over each one.
[133:00.04]Until you scan all the drones in a sector, consider it a no fly zone.
[133:05.36]No flying until the surveillance drones are taken care of.
[133:08.94]No problem.
[133:10.90]I'll send you the location of the first one so you can get to work.
[133:15.52]OK.
[133:17.64]So we could also... Let's do the... I'll do that later.
[133:22.47]Let's go do this.
[133:24.58]Yeah.
[133:26.84]Let's go take on Penguin.
[133:29.44]I'm ready.
[133:43.89]Only two crimes.
[133:46.01]Well, I'm... I'm working on it.
[133:53.50]When are you going to do a face reveal?
[134:02.81]Very, very soon.
[134:04.43]Very soon.
[134:05.63]In like five minutes.
[134:09.91]Face reveal in five minutes.
[134:20.65]Wait, what?
[134:25.28]I've gotta stop the penguin.
[134:40.91]Dude, I'll be here.
[134:42.13]Yep.
[134:43.97]For the first time ever, you're gonna see my face.
[134:53.86]Alright.
[134:55.94]I wonder if you actually fight the penguin.
[135:00.13]I'm so curious about this.
[135:01.35]Talk to the penguin.
[135:26.02]I'm here.
[135:26.42]Defeat the penguin's guards.
[135:28.55]Avoid taking damage.
[135:29.65]Alright, well... Didn't say anything about stealth.
[135:37.35]Stop!
[135:41.99]This game really makes you feel like... Batgirl.
[135:50.61]Don't think so.
[135:57.74]Shit, I got hurt.
[136:03.84]Okay, nice.
[136:10.23]Oh, shit.
[136:13.33]She's kicking the shit out of us.
[136:17.71]Oh, my.
[136:21.82]You can't fit in here.
[136:38.93]That was pretty cool.
[136:39.87]Alright, Batgirl is part of this.
[136:43.02]Batgirl is the coolest character in the game.
[136:52.66]No, please.
[137:09.02]Alright, nice.
[137:15.37]Penguin!
[137:19.75]Nowhere to go anywhere.
[137:20.67]Nowhere to hide, Penguin.
[137:23.39]Open up.
[137:26.22]Can I have a rocket launcher pointing at the door?
[137:28.26]No.
[137:28.92]So you can't use a door after all.
[137:31.24]So where were we?
[137:53.29]They're listening.
[137:55.51]You may have questions, but I can think of a few reasons not to answer them.
[138:08.87]They could have probably heard that with music.
[138:13.43]Am I supposed to be like acting?
[138:22.90]Oh, okay.
[138:25.70]There's one in the chest set.
[138:26.74]No.
[138:27.84]Well, I'm an expert hacker, so I got this.
[138:33.49]Where are the bugs?
[138:34.99]Where are the bugs?
[138:35.95]My eyes aren't what they used to be.
[138:49.14]Alright, so I'm gonna pick up one of these bugs.
[138:51.17]Things that's bugged.
[138:52.13]I'm gonna turn it.
[138:53.05]I'm gonna aim my mouth right where the bug is as close as I can and I'm gonna go... Where are they?
[139:16.70]Where are the bugs?
[139:20.03]Where are the bugs?
[139:26.95]You need to smash them.
[139:30.56]Under the desk or something?
[139:40.37]OK, how can I punch?
[139:50.92]When's the face reveal?
[139:51.82]Dude, don't rush it.
[139:57.78]Oh, okay.
[139:59.47]How do I destroy them then?
[140:00.27]Plant.
[140:21.72]Yeah, she's an expert hacker.
[140:25.78]Two.
[140:28.07]And one more.
[140:29.05]I feel like I could probably do this.
[140:36.43]The singing.
[140:48.26]It's a... I'm kind of afraid that it will be...
[140:52.73]It's either going to be, wow, holy shit, I can't believe you can actually do that, or that was like the cringiest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
[140:59.17]And I'm not sure which one.
[141:00.99]I'm kind of afraid to do it.
[141:02.61]Do you want to try?
[141:05.87]This is like really fucking dumb.
[141:24.15]I'll try after.
[141:29.35]Here's what I don't get.
[141:30.69]How come you had to serve your sentence while the rest of your rich friends got a free pass?
[141:37.51]They were favored.
[141:40.03]I wasn't.
[141:40.81]Who'd you piss off?
[141:43.79]But no one talks about them.
[141:45.97]A lot of whiskey.
[141:46.61]Not a whispered word is said.
[141:50.61]The Court of Owls isn't real.
[141:59.14]This is how you get off your chair.
[142:00.74]Yes, it is.
[142:02.10]Yep.
[142:03.98]Where the super rich go for shits and giggles.
[142:07.72]Might be worth a peek.
[142:09.50]Personally, I stay far away from that raptor's nest.
[142:14.38]But it's fine if I head in there.
[142:18.50]I lost years of my life to Blackgate.
[142:22.84]You go do what you do best.
[142:28.83]Just don't tell them I sent you.
[142:31.15]Is he a good guy?
[142:32.11]Is he a bad guy?
[142:35.30]Alright, I'll try.
[142:42.84]With a little practice, I probably heard something.
[142:45.87]Do you think he's up to something?
[142:48.21]I wouldn't be surprised, but he seemed pretty convinced that the Court of Owls exists.
[142:54.14]Sounds good.
[142:54.89]Awful.
[142:55.07]Very cool.
[143:11.12]Alright, let's put some points in.
[143:12.38]Let's go back to the bat cave, whatever it is.
[143:16.32]I'll do my face reveal, and then we're going to move on to another game.
[143:20.49]We're going to play Deadly Night.
[143:21.75]Alfred's been going out a lot lately.
[143:31.68]maybe he's doing some crime fighting of his own okay check out alfred Jacob kane he said he wanted to walk he knows this is Gotham right that's what I said and he called me a mother hen anyway probably a mother hen no problem units needed near the ferry terminal there's been reports of suspicious activity
[144:01.20]Alright.
[144:02.52]That is going to be it for today for this game.
[144:08.24]We're going to move on to Deadly Night.
[144:14.45]That was Gotham Knights again.
[144:15.87]The game is out now.
[144:18.95]It is available.
[144:20.81]You can get it right now on PS5, Xbox Series X, Series S, PC.
[144:26.50]There's a link in the panel image.
[144:32.94]And also, we'll be playing it tomorrow.
[144:39.67]Thank you, Warner Brothers, again, for the sponsor.
[144:41.95]I know this has been like an Omega sponsor.
[144:44.33]But WB's been really awesome to work with.
[144:47.19]And has been a great supporter of the channel.
[144:49.22]So, I'm having fun with it.
[144:52.72]Like I said yesterday, I would be lying to you if I told you that I was not enjoying my experience.
[144:58.80]I think we should at least give her a chance.
[145:03.20]Open world games are just kind of fun to mess around in.
[145:07.00]And here comes the face reveal.
[145:08.44]Okay, here we go.
[145:09.16]Was it alright?
[145:34.60]Alright, give me two minutes.
[145:36.06]I'll be right back.
[145:36.94]We're going to switch to Deadly Night.
[145:38.88]It's a scary game.
[145:39.98]It's late at night now.
[145:42.02]It's going to be terrifying, and I'm going to play it.
[145:45.40]It is not a controller game, so give me like two, three minutes to get this ready.
[145:51.28]I'll be right back.
[145:56.05]And again, there'll be more Gotham Knights tomorrow.
[146:01.81]See you soon.
[146:03.16]See you in two minutes.
