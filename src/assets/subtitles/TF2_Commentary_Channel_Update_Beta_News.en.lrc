[00:09.65]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.85]Jerma here again with the Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:14.58]Today I'm going to be playing as the soldier with the black box, the Reserve Shooter, and the equalizer.
[00:21.14]But I kind of want to talk about something else.
[00:24.04]I'll bring up the gameplay every now and then, but I really, really want to talk about something that's kind of important.
[00:29.74]The direction of my channel.
[00:32.75]and where I plan on being in the next six months, what I'm going to be uploading.
[00:36.95]I want to keep you guys in the loop because I don't just want to start uploading random games and have you guys go, whoa, what is going on here?
[00:43.18]What is this?
[00:44.40]So before I even get started with that, I want to tell you guys that this channel is going to be and will always be
[00:51.05]a Team Fortress 2 content channel.
[00:53.73]I never plan on abandoning the game.
[00:56.15]I never have.
[00:57.11]I've been playing the game since it released in beta, and I've never gotten sick of it yet.
[01:01.37]I don't plan on getting sick of it, so I'll probably be uploading Team Fortress 2 content
[01:06.26]Until I die.
[01:08.22]So, don't be afraid of this video, me telling you some new things I want to try.
[01:13.00]There's a lot of new games coming out, guys.
[01:15.02]A lot of big, big titles that everyone's really excited about.
[01:19.63]I'll get into the ones that I'm most excited for and the ones that I'm going to be playing and uploading on this channel.
[01:25.43]This channel will probably always be predominantly Evolve channel.
[01:30.65]I don't really plan on getting the Modern Warfare games or Battlefield or anything like that.
[01:34.96]valve right now has Dota 2 and Counter-Strike the new Counter-Strike global offensive in development right now not really sure when they're gonna come out but when they do come out guys I'm going to be making a lot of videos on those games I was a really really huge Counter-Strike 1.6 fan and a Counter-Strike source fan once Team Fortress 2 came out though that all ended because Team Fortress 2 really just trumped all the other games in my opinion but regardless
[02:04.15]Gonna be really excited for the new Counter-Strike, and Dota 2 is a really interesting game.
[02:08.31]I played a lot of Dota when it was a Warcraft mod, back when I was a big Blizzard fan.
[02:12.22]We'll get into that in a second.
[02:13.98]So expect a lot of videos on those two games.
[02:17.24]Now getting back to Blizzard...
[02:19.67]I was a huge Diablo II fan, almost to the point where it was a sickness.
[02:25.35]So naturally, when Diablo 3 is coming out, I am insanely excited for that game.
[02:31.92]So there's gonna be a lot of Diablo 3 content on this channel, but that's pretty much it.
[02:37.48]I don't really plan on doing many other games besides those three coming up.
[02:41.62]And you have to keep something in mind.
[02:44.01]These games that I'm mentioning right now, guys, are potentially six or seven months away.
[02:50.69]Diablo 3 is supposed to release at the end of this year, but you guys know Blizzard.
[02:55.59]That's never going to happen.
[02:57.34]That will never happen.
[02:59.16]Diablo 3 will probably come out sometime next year.
[03:03.26]Nobody knows, but that is the direction that I want to take this channel in.
[03:07.98]Hopefully some of you guys are as excited for these games as I am.
[03:11.79]I haven't been this excited for new games since I was probably 15 or 16.
[03:16.13]It is a terrific time to be a gamer.
[03:19.81]So let's talk about some Team Fortress 2, huh?
[03:23.17]Had a special request to play on 2Fort.
[03:26.50]Gotta tell you guys, I'm not a big 2Fort fan.
[03:29.80]I'm not a big CTF fan, because CTF games really, really drag on.
[03:34.25]They go for a million years.
[03:35.93]They never end.
[03:37.09]And speaking of never ending, look at the timer for this 24-7 2Fort server.
[03:42.98]Like, over a hundred minutes.
[03:45.38]Like, oh my god.
[03:47.62]That's why these games can just turn into messes where nothing happens for like three hours.
[03:53.64]So anyways, the Team Fortress 2 beta just updated for the first time in, what, two months or something like that?
[04:01.64]They just added a bunch of new cool content.
[04:04.41]In the beta now, you can wear multiple miscellaneous items.
[04:07.77]So for a lot of you guys that have multiple spy miscellaneouses or engineer miscs, it's really cool because now you can put both on rather than have to choose one miscellaneous item.
[04:17.21]That's really interesting.
[04:18.38]The number one change for me, I was so happy when I saw this because it's been a while.
[04:23.14]And they didn't do anything with the Widowmaker.
[04:25.18]And I was thinking, are they... They're not going to do anything with this?
[04:28.58]Are they going to leave it like this?
[04:30.72]Nope.
[04:31.08]Apparently they are buffing the Widowmaker, guys.
[04:33.97]No longer in the beta does it take 60 metal to shoot the weapon.
[04:37.97]It now only takes 30 metal to shoot the weapon.
[04:40.99]So that's a huge change.
[04:42.89]Because if you do the math, 30 times 6 is only 180.
[04:47.44]So you're going to have the same amount of shots as the regular shotgun if you have full metal.
[04:52.88]I'm not sure how the mechanic actually works.
[04:54.70]I don't have the beta installed.
[04:56.43]But regardless, it's definitely a welcome change.
[04:58.85]I'm glad they're finally doing something with the Widowmaker.
[05:01.59]So thumbs up.
[05:02.87]You're doing engineers everywhere a great service and a great justice.
[05:07.40]Because I'm so glad that I'm not going to have to be able to only pick the Frontier Justice.
[05:11.88]Frontier Justice is my favorite item in the game.
[05:14.68]But, you know, it's cool to mix up and not have to use the same damn thing over and over again.
[05:20.29]That's the problem with the Engineer.
[05:22.25]He only has three, maybe two or three good loadout options.
[05:26.92]So you're using the same stuff over and over again.
[05:30.26]So it's definitely a good change.
[05:32.12]But I want a sentry that shoots electric missile bombs.
[05:36.80]I'm just kidding, that's not true.
[05:38.46]So I'll wrap this up now.
[05:40.44]Wanted to give you guys a channel update and a couple little snippets from the beta update.
[05:44.78]Just to let you guys know where my head's at, what I plan on doing.
[05:48.24]Oh, and by the way, my birthday was awesome.
[05:50.66]Thank you everybody for giving me birthday wishes.
[05:53.49]I read every single one of those comments, read every single one of my channel comments.
[05:57.35]Thank you.
[05:57.91]Thank you for the birthday wishes, and...
[06:00.31]When you have your birthday, happy birthday, whenever it is.
[06:03.71]If your birthday is seven months from now or like two weeks from now, happy birthday from Jerma.
[06:09.34]So thank you all so much for watching again.
[06:11.10]I really appreciate it.
[06:12.60]And let me know in the comments what games you're excited for.
[06:15.96]It doesn't matter if they're going to come out this month or next month or two years from now.
[06:20.46]What games do you guys want to play?
[06:22.14]What games are you guys excited for?
[06:23.88]I'd really like to know.
[06:25.12]So let me know.
[06:26.34]Take care, everybody.
[06:27.12]I'll see you all next time.
[06:30.64]The enemy has taken our intelligence.
[06:41.22]Victory.
