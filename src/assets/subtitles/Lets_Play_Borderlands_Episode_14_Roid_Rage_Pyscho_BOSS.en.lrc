[02:38.17]My bird's gone and now I'm about to die.
[02:39.63]He's almost dead, though.
[02:41.58]Watch out, he's using a grenade.
[02:43.50]Oh, his health valve!
[02:44.99]Give me it!
[02:45.61]Give me it!
[02:47.03]Oh wow, I would activate this thing right before I fall.
[02:50.35]Oh my god.
[02:54.20]Ow.
[02:54.78]Yeah, I'm done.
[02:57.72]Maybe I can absorb some of the damage while you, uh...
[03:04.12]No, I'm respawning.
[03:05.18]How you doing?
[03:21.86]You alright?
[03:23.20]Yeah.
[03:27.44]I'm making my way there right now.
[03:34.92]Alright, I'm here.
[03:35.30]I got him, I got him, I got him.
[03:40.69]Wait, let me get the kill.
[03:41.81]Get the kill.
[03:42.33]Oh, he's got like no health left.
[03:49.83]Get him!
[03:50.11]Get him!
[03:50.91]Oh no!
[03:55.56]There we go.
[03:57.22]Oh, that was beautiful.
[03:59.02]Oh, there's a nice sniper down there.
[04:03.90]He dropped a grenade and we both just got hit by it.
[04:06.56]No, that was funny.
[04:10.42]Alright, so let's... Okay, wait, let me get my skill point thing.
[04:17.38]Alright, let me see.
[04:19.18]While phase walking, you regenerate 4% of your health.
[04:22.18]That's not bad.
[04:24.25]I just activated this thing, so here's the key.
[04:28.64]Alright.
[04:29.58]Oh, now we have to go all the way back around, great.
[04:35.18]Do we have anything on the ground?
[04:37.16]I don't think so, doesn't look like it.
[04:40.79]Where do we have to go?
[04:41.45]Do we have to go all the way back out?
[04:43.27]This door opened over here.
[04:45.87]She just opened this door for us, it looks like.
[04:47.53]Lady in our heads.
[04:58.09]The other people or no?
[04:58.93]We just gotta get out of here.
[05:00.45]Yeah.
[05:06.07]Holy shit, look at this.
[05:07.47]Alright.
[05:10.93]Cha-ching.
[05:13.38]Ballin'.
[05:15.44]Cha-ching.
[05:16.98]Do we have anything up here?
[05:17.88]Oh yeah, chest up here.
[05:19.50]Is there a chest up here?
[05:20.66]God, I love how it pays off to explore.
[05:22.64]This one must have good stuff, too.
[05:25.87]Oh, I just jumped to try and jump over there.
[05:28.45]And I fell down.
[05:32.15]So, I have to go this way.
[05:33.86]Here, it's fine.
[05:34.76]There's not even any good stuff up here.
[05:38.26]Okay, let's go.
[05:39.34]Onwards.
[05:42.54]Anyways, around here.
[05:45.89]Yeah, I gotta go the wrong way.
[05:47.35]I fell down, so I gotta go the wrong way.
[05:49.01]Oh, hello.
[05:50.89]I am Jerma.
[05:51.59]I am running around.
[05:52.55]I'm running around in circles because I fell down because I'm an idiot.
[05:58.23]Okay.
[05:58.57]I love how many things you dropped.
[06:01.93]Right over here.
[06:05.97]Oh wait, ammo.
[06:08.81]No, it's the other way.
[06:10.05]Oh, four rockets.
[06:12.41]I can't wait till you lay somebody out with that thing.
[06:16.14]That would be great.
[06:16.88]I can't wait.
[06:17.38]That would have made our life so much easier if we were just like one level higher.
[06:26.36]Oh, man.
[06:28.42]Get a kill on one of these guys.
[06:34.58]Here we go.
[06:36.76]I can heal you.
[06:38.54]Yeah, it's like in Left 4 Dead where you fall down E next to somebody.
[06:42.04]But I think you can't be taking any damage or anything.
[06:44.90]I think that's how it works.
[06:51.86]Oh, look at that.
[06:54.20]Look at that.
[06:55.04]Let me see if this is better than my other repeater.
[07:05.09]Um...
[07:11.11]The accuracy goes down, but it is better, so I'm going to take that.
[07:23.37]Jesus, I hate the lack of accuracy in some guns.
[07:33.53]Yeah, it is pretty annoying.
[07:34.59]Oh, I'm throwing the bird up there.
[07:41.78]throwing a nade up there.
[07:43.26]Oh, that was pretty awesome.
[07:45.31]Master Exploder.
[07:46.57]Oh, I just picked that up accidentally.
[07:47.77]Oh, what the heck was this?
[07:48.67]I think that was a sniper rifle that I picked up.
[07:50.79]I think that was a sniper rifle.
[07:53.07]Oh, man.
[07:53.49]I am going to die.
[07:55.53]You did the honest run of them there.
[07:59.66]Oh, that just bounced back into me.
[08:01.34]Oh, my God.
[08:10.86]Get in there, bird.
[08:22.41]Alright, my shield's back.
[08:27.55]I ain't afraid of you.
[08:30.41]I don't like it.
[08:32.38]If you're not taking a lot of damage, you can revive.
[08:44.99]If we're getting smoked by a bunch of people, it's not a good idea for me to try and revive you.
[08:48.73]But if we got a second, we should be fine.
[08:55.73]Alright, here we go.
[08:57.15]We did it!
[08:57.53]We made it!
[08:57.89]We're just gonna go buy some grenades.
[08:59.95]We're gonna get some full health.
[09:00.99]I'm gonna sell some stuff.
[09:11.70]Good call.
[09:14.22]Wow, I just sold that really good rifle I had.
[09:17.68]Here, wait, maybe I can buy it back.
[09:21.40]There we go.
[09:22.62]I think it's kind of hard to tell, like, it really is kind of hard to tell what you're selling, what you're not selling, because they're all listed in that little row, you know what I mean?
[09:30.34]You're just like, oh, sell this, this, this, this.
[09:31.93]They all have the same names and things.
[09:35.33]I can understand, because I've done it too.
[09:37.61]People just haven't seen it.
[09:38.53]Ha ha.
[09:49.80]Let me just see what I have in here.
[09:55.38]The rocket launcher, 1069 it sells for.
[09:58.94]Oh no, yeah, I have all the stuff I need right now.
[10:02.48]Yeah, I just need to compare this really quick.
[10:17.29]The fire rate on this is super low, but it's really strong.
[10:20.66]Yeah, a lot of weapons are like that in this game.
[10:22.14]They have, like, slow, slow reload, a slow fire rate, but they're, like, deadly.
[10:25.73]Let me use this healing kit.
[10:39.01]And I'll gain health like this really fast.
[10:42.19]Yeah, that heals you, right?
[10:43.69]Yeah.
[10:44.73]I'm gonna be upgrading that because it's really useful.
[10:47.29]Yeah, that's really useful.
[10:48.95]It'll come in handy.
[10:50.35]Are we good?
[10:51.19]Yeah, I think we gotta get out of here now.
[10:53.75]There we go.
[10:57.01]Oh, I forgot something going up!
[10:58.17]I'm just kidding.
[11:01.93]I left my dog back there.
[11:06.33]Shall we call it a day?
[11:08.05]I think so, yeah.
[11:09.42]That was fun.
[11:10.60]Yeah, that was a good little run.
[11:11.74]And I'm pretty glad that we're not gonna have Ekko this time.
[11:15.40]At least I hope not.
[11:16.94]Yeah, I mean, yeah, we probably should.
[11:19.46]And if we do, then something else is going on that we just have no idea what it is.
[11:25.53]Super sexy jump!
[11:27.59]Yeah, I'll, uh... I'll, uh... What do you want to record again?
[11:33.75]um... maybe soon.
[11:35.78]Oh, jeez, that jumped.
[11:38.28]That was crazy.
[11:39.46]I'll be around pretty much all this week, so whenever you want to do it, at the same time tomorrow.
