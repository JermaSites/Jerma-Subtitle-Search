[00:01.57]Hey!
[00:01.81]What's happening?
[00:04.49]So, uh, I gotta do something real quick.
[00:06.32]I promised I was gonna do this.
[00:08.24]Just make sure that I'm ready to go, and I'm gonna do a backflip right now.
[00:12.96]Here comes a backflip.
[00:18.11]That was a pretty good landing.
[00:19.05]I stuck it completely.
[00:21.95]I'll do two in a row?
[00:23.33]Do two in a row?
[00:23.99]Okay, okay, I'll try.
[00:29.94]Damn.
[00:30.68]Alright.
[00:31.88]I kinda hurt my back a little bit doing that.
[00:34.19]I'm alright.
[00:42.77]Anyways, hi.
[00:43.93]How are you?
[00:45.13]Welcome to Connect... Connect Crap.

[01:00.32]Today... We're gonna do some extra... Not extras.
[01:05.06]We're gonna do some extra.
[01:07.10]Now... We've got... Connect Star Wars.
[01:10.91]That's gonna be a popular one.
[01:12.15]I can already tell.
[01:13.47]We've got... Into the Nightmare.
[01:16.03]Whatever this horror movie is.
[01:18.09]We've got... Harry Potter.
[01:23.38]Episodes 5, 6, and 7.
[01:24.40]We've got...
[01:32.82]Oh, I'm not even gonna say the name of that one or else it'll give it away.
[01:45.33]Had to get that out.
[01:46.05]I did three, I did four backflips in a row.
[01:48.21]So I had to kind of get that out of my system.
[01:51.94]We're gonna start with...
[01:55.10]Connect Star Wars.
[01:56.96]By the way, I want to make sure you understand this, because I need to say it a few times.
[02:01.16]I know what's in this game.
[02:03.32]And this will be the only time, ever, and I really mean this, ever, that you're going to see me dance on this string.
[02:16.43]Ever.
[02:19.41]We're going to do one song, I think.
[02:21.89]And I know it's the one you go like this.
[02:25.13]And... Oh, fuck.
[02:27.61]Not ready.
[02:29.45]Not ready.
[02:29.87]Hold on.

[02:35.57]Hold on.
[02:35.89]Not ready.
[02:38.37]Not ready.
[02:40.13]My wireless, like, Bluetooth setup.
[02:42.10]I didn't put it... I didn't set it up.
[02:44.02]God damn it.
[02:44.66]I had to charge it.
[02:46.52]Hold on.
[02:46.80]It shouldn't take too long.
[02:49.32]How could I forget about my fucking wireless capabilities?
[02:52.60]Alright, this is good.
[02:53.36]That's it.
[02:57.48]Okay, there's the right just got to sink it and I'm ready to go hold on Stupid alright sinking now Here we go Battery fully charged.

[03:26.40]Don't make me look like a fool.
[03:34.11]The one... Bluetooth pairing successful.
[03:40.85]Bluetooth connected.
[03:43.09]Oh, yeah.
[03:44.61]Don't ever tell me.
[03:45.29]I don't know.
[03:49.87]You see that image?
[03:50.71]Alright, I gotta test it.
[03:52.49]I gotta test it.
[03:53.04]Hold on.
[03:56.21]Alright, let's go over here.
[03:58.57]Just like tying a tie.
[03:59.69]Around the neck.
[04:03.67]Under and then over.
[04:06.22]Make it a little looser.
[04:07.06]Alright, I got my tie on.
[04:10.56]Wait, that's not good.
[04:14.86]How did I do this last time?
[04:16.22]How did I do this last time?
[04:17.02]Did anybody see me do it?
[04:18.68]Did anybody actually see me do this last time?
[04:20.11]No, you didn't.
[04:21.55]Alright, I'm ready.
[04:22.09]Here we go.
[04:23.43]Through the loop.
[04:25.43]Tighten it.
[04:26.67]There we go.
[04:27.07]Through the loop again.
[04:29.97]Into the shirt.
[04:30.75]That's what it was.
[04:32.71]Alright, I'm good.
[04:34.75]Alright.
[04:37.19]Alright.
[04:38.91]Synced up.
[04:39.95]Here we go.
[04:41.43]It's time to play Star Wars.
[04:43.09]The Kinect version.
[04:46.25]Why did it just spit the disk out at me?
[04:48.33]Why?
[04:49.44]What are you talking about?
[04:54.94]It just, like, spit it back out.
[04:58.13]Okay, I think we're good.
[05:00.09]Welcome, everybody, to Connect Crap My Pants 2.
[05:12.02]I got water this time.
[05:14.10]Thanks.
[05:28.41]I probably should turn it down.
[05:33.83]It might be a little too loud.
[05:35.31]Just a little bit.
[05:36.13]That's better.
[05:38.55]So remember, this is Kinect.
[05:39.57]If you don't know what the Kinect is, it is a terminal reality.
[05:43.62]It's a virtual reality simulation system.
[05:48.22]How do I skip all this?
[05:54.79]This game autosaves automatically.
[05:56.11]Please do not turn off your console when you see this symbol.
[06:04.66]Oh, Atu, do be careful.
[06:06.44]Master Luch is most insistent that we not disturb anything.
[06:12.39]I love Star Wars.
[06:13.03]Oh, Otto!
[06:13.27]Otto!
[06:13.39]Very good.
[06:13.61]Uh, start game.
[06:14.05]Start game.
[06:14.61]Start game.
[06:39.82]It says the microphone symbols down there.
[06:42.22]I'm just supposed to assume it's not going to work.
[06:44.15]It's like continue to play using this profile or sign in to choose a different one.
[06:50.23]This game uses drop in drop.
[06:51.47]Yeah, it's 10 to Dragoon 74.
[06:53.21]It's me.
[06:57.30]Yes, this is going to start to get low here over the next few Kinect streams, I think.
[07:03.00]And yes, I've got the thing in the hair to make sure it doesn't get in my face today.
[07:08.60]Ooh, Jedi Destiny Darkside Rising.
[07:10.14]We've also got
[07:39.59]Pod racing?
[07:42.07]Pod racing?
[07:44.57]Galactic dance-off.
[07:49.23]Rancor Rampage.
[07:52.19]When am I going to use my lightsaber?
[07:53.37]Duel of Fates.
[07:55.13]I can't use my lightsaber yet.
[07:56.25]I'm not doing the dance-off first.
[07:59.43]Absolutely not.
[08:00.71]Okay, what about Jedi Destiny?
[08:02.17]Jedi Destiny.
[08:02.71]Dark Side Rising.
[08:03.33]Let's do this one.
[08:08.07]I want to use the lightsaber.
[08:10.13]Do the dance off.
[08:10.99]I'm not doing the dance off first.
[08:12.31]That's like the pinnacle of all online content for me.
[08:15.19]I think I'm going to do that first.
[08:17.03]It's the only time you're ever going to get this dance off stream.
[08:19.39]It's like the best thing that I will ever do on this channel.
[08:39.79]Here we go.
[08:40.65]Get away.
[08:42.50]Excellent.
[08:44.06]Now call up the file, R2.
[08:45.84]Let's take a better look at the commander's selection.
[08:48.86]Begin the destiny.
[08:49.88]I'm ready.
[08:53.10]Do I play as... Am I the Jedi in Star Wars Connect?
[09:00.02]No.
[09:00.22]I have to pick from a random Jedi?
[09:04.01]The Jedi history really is quite stirring.
[09:06.69]Honestly, my compassion algorithms have never seen so much use.
[09:10.99]I can't be like Darth me?
[09:12.29]I don't know who I wanna play as.
[09:21.46]I think I'm gonna be the alien over here.
[09:23.04]By my calculations, there is a 63.44% chance that any of these operations- When Dealer is showing a six, I know C-3PO.
[09:37.56]I'm just gonna, uh, singe?
[09:41.12]Casual or advanced.
[09:43.28]That was a fucking funny joke, because that actually is the percentage.
[09:45.42]It's like 63.4%.
[09:46.12]I swear to God, that's a funny joke.
[09:48.48]It is.
[09:48.80]I don't care if anybody thinks it's funny.
[09:50.02]I think it's funny.
[09:50.64]Alright, wait, what?
[09:51.60]What are you doing?
[09:52.24]I want to... Select my Padawan?
[09:53.30]That's me, right?
[10:08.29]Okay, Dar Singe.
[10:13.19]Oh, it's Plif, Plif 2.
[10:14.93]Oh, whatever.
[10:16.21]Let's go.
[10:16.53]What the fuck did I do?
[10:21.24]Let's see if I can get a good spot where the sun beams right into my fucking eyes.
[10:29.28]I'll get it.
[10:29.62]Oh shit.
[10:33.50]Star Wars!
[10:35.20]Right.
[10:37.39]Oh, he's singing, that means he has to go like this!
[10:43.27]Alright, how do I make it go up faster?
[10:51.52]Go up faster!
[10:53.98]It is a time of uncertainty.
[10:57.90]It is a time of uncertainty, alarmed by the encounter with the Sith Lord Darth Maul on Naboo.
[11:04.55]The Jedi Council has begun strengthening the ranks of the Jedi Order by opening training outposts to instruct a new generation of Padawan learners.
[11:14.66]Meanwhile, events throughout the galaxy suggest that the influence of the dark side is spreading.
[11:21.00]A group of Padawans are on their way to
[11:24.32]Kashyyyk, homeworld of the Wookiees, to learn about the Force in preparation for the difficult times ahead.
[11:34.64]Alright, let's go.
[11:41.41]Is that synced up?
[11:43.45]You should hear the snap when my hand comes up there like that.
[11:49.58]Bored.
[11:50.70]Let's go.
[12:12.47]Welcome, Padawans.
[12:15.35]Each one of you is strong in the Force.
[12:17.93]Brave.
[12:19.01]Instructed in the teachings of our Order.
[12:22.54]But not all of you will become Jedi.
[12:26.98]As you know, Padawans must proceed through a series of trials.
[12:31.91]Trials of skill.
[12:34.35]courage, insight.
[12:36.89]These qualities are needed now more than ever.
[12:39.78]And it is a path very few can walk.
[12:42.80]Stop, you're gonna blow this for me, stop!
[12:47.94]Don't blow it for me.
[12:48.96]I gotta pick my lightsaber now.
[12:50.52]Join me, Padawan.
[12:52.86]No, that's not on me.
[12:56.36]The lightsaber, singular tool of the Jedi.
[13:01.11]I think it's coming out of the circulation of my brain.
[13:04.15]It is me!
[13:04.35]You got it.
[13:04.87]Oh shit!
[13:05.05]He's insane!
[13:31.63]Let's start with some simple drills.
[13:34.67]Swing back and forth until you feel comfortable.
[13:37.44]Shouldn't we step back from each other?
[13:38.82]I think you're too close.
[13:40.88]We're going to clang.
[13:41.40]Some of the ancient Jedi forms.
[13:43.90]You've been practicing these since you were younglings.
[13:49.88]Very good, Padawan.
[13:53.78]Should I clang them?
[13:54.34]Let's move on.
[13:55.12]Just ding!
[13:58.08]Just block?
[14:03.72]I didn't get to customize my character?
[14:09.87]Alright, that's a really dangerous move, because if you fuck that up, that goes through your back and kills you.
[14:18.33]Like, even if you're slightly off, I mean, it looks real cool, but that literally goes through the back of your skull and you die.
[14:30.77]I mean, that was kind of cool, Teach.
[14:33.53]Check this out.
[14:34.15]I win.
[14:34.35]Can I two-hand?
[14:36.07]I'm a two-handed sword kind of guy.
[14:56.41]As Master Yoda can attest, we live in an uncivilized time.
[15:00.53]In combat, many of your opponents will use blasters.
[15:03.99]If you can't get close enough to strike your enemy, you'll need to deflect their blaster bolts.
[15:09.33]So you just gotta go, beep.
[15:11.13]Now it's your turn.
[15:15.25]Audio is desynced.
[15:16.79]I don't care.
[15:17.23]Some enemies will attack from a distance.
[15:19.62]Use your lightsaber for deflection.
[15:21.38]I'm not doing this shit like yesterday.
[15:30.18]Very good.
[15:31.44]One guy's not going to turn the stream off for like 30 minutes to get me to... I know it's safe.
[15:35.62]I checked it.
[15:36.34]It's not perfect, but it never will be because it's connected.
[15:38.80]What?
[15:38.90]What?
[15:58.27]How was that?
[16:01.53]I've done it like four times!
[16:05.95]I'm sorry, I got a D.
[16:26.90]I got a date.
[16:27.42]There will be times when your opponent won't simply vaporize or be sliced into pieces.
[16:32.21]Sometimes you will have a true duel.
[16:34.94]You two, come forward.
[16:38.50]Let's move on.
[16:39.70]You'll need some space for this, so spread out.
[16:42.22]Of course, these are all training sabers, so no one will lose an arm today.
[16:45.90]I want to do the thing that you did.
[16:46.80]It will cost quite a wealth, though.
[16:48.40]Wouldn't be very instructive unless you do one thing.
[16:50.08]I can't do it, like, from behind the back?
[16:51.74]Engage your opponent.
[16:52.95]Attempt to block their lightsaber strikes.
[16:55.61]Left, right, high, low.
[16:57.91]Pay close attention to the enemy's attacks.
[17:05.51]Move your saber to the correct position, Padawan.
[17:09.58]I just, what?
[17:11.36]Okay.
[17:12.94]I thought I just cut off my head.
[17:16.86]I just blocked it.
[17:17.38]Why am I dodging?
[17:18.80]I shouldn't be dodging.
[17:21.46]Why am I dodging?
[17:22.68]I shouldn't be dodging.
[17:49.14]opponent away at the right your opponent is off balance you now have your opening now remember your training and try to defeat your opponent in a duel
[18:21.01]I didn't win Clash.
[18:28.54]Do I have to hold it?
[18:32.00]I have to kick him!
[18:32.90]Okay.
[18:36.40]There we go.
[18:58.06]He's whoa don't do a finishing move Fatality a good beginning Padawan, but there'll be much more to learn on Kashyyyk prepare for arrival And now it's time for your next Jedi technique the fucking dancing I
[19:29.00]Alright, let's go.
[19:30.08]Alright, let's go.
[19:38.29]I think you're ready to block.
[19:55.80]Block, block.
[19:57.58]Slash.
[19:59.42]Should I skip the cinematic?
[20:00.30]Does anybody care about Star Wars?
[20:01.50]No, nobody cares about the story in Star Wars.
[20:05.48]They just care about the light thing that makes cool sounds.
[20:07.88]It's Mr. Yoda.
[20:08.66]And Mr. Windu is here too.
[20:10.11]I can't believe it.
[20:10.79]It's Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[20:12.83]He defeated the Sith Lord.
[20:16.45]Welcome, padawans.
[20:17.83]Brought here in a dark time, you are.
[20:20.23]Time of trials, yes.
[20:22.13]Time of danger?
[20:23.43]Great hope in you, we have.
[20:25.03]I can't do it.
[20:26.91]Tomorrow, your lessons begin.
[20:43.53]Here are your new trainees, Master Yoda.
[20:45.91]I'll warn you, they're still very rough.
[20:47.95]But they do have potential.
[20:50.36]Say the same for you we once did, long ago.
[20:55.08]No Padawan could ask for a better master than you.
[20:59.18]A pleasure you were.
[21:01.88]You've done very well, Marvel.
[21:03.80]The Council thanks you.
[21:05.51]We know you understand the importance of this undertaking.
[21:08.73]There's something troubling you, Master Yoda.
[21:12.52]Something dark I see in these Padawans' future.
[21:17.16]We have all sensed it, and yet the Council's vision remains clouded.
[21:21.64]The events on Naboo, Darth Maul's appearance, these were no aberrations.
[21:27.23]There is a darkness rising in the galaxy, and the Sith Master waits in the shadows.
[21:35.13]I must return now to Coruscant.
[21:37.41]May the Force be with you.
[21:45.95]Why is this Wipeout Wookiee Edition?
[21:47.17]Wait, hold on, do I have to do this?
[22:15.21]I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.
[22:19.47]I'm standing here.
[22:20.61]I'm standing right here.
[22:22.27]Oh, God.
[22:23.53]We have to do wipe out Wookiee challenge.
[22:35.28]What?
[22:45.22]Trust your feelings.
[22:46.62]Leap up, and far you will go.
[22:50.84]Use our senses.
[22:55.88]Avoid these obstacles quickly.
[22:57.24]I hate this.
[23:04.09]Lucky you are, that this is only a test.
[23:17.79]Go!
[23:18.31]What the fuck are you doing?
[23:20.27]Nice!
[24:12.15]Am I out of, like, Naruto powers?
[24:17.25]Why can't I just walk?
[24:17.97]Oh, well.
[24:48.68]I jumped through it.
[24:49.40]I just want to walk.
[24:59.56]He's laughing at you.
[25:00.34]There must be.
[25:16.95]Use the Force to knock over the training dummy.
[25:25.47]What?
[25:34.25]Wrong arm.
[25:34.86]Concentrate.
[25:36.24]Focus.
[25:37.18]Do not be afraid.
[25:38.44]You have displayed the deepest commitment and a most serious mind.
[25:43.56]Gaiju, these will.
[25:46.22]I'm itching my leg.
[25:48.78]He's, like, putting his hand... I can't, like, itch my leg.
[25:52.55]Oh, get in there!
[25:55.25]It looks like fun!
[25:56.07]Oh.
[25:56.15]Oof.
[25:56.29]Good.
[25:56.55]Yeah.
[26:19.77]It's just Jillian Michaels in the jungle workout routine.
[26:24.35]Now we have to play Angry Birds.
[26:26.02]Select the rocks and fling them toward the tower.
[26:28.30]Feel the force.
[26:55.37]not bad very good first hit first try a simple rock or even an explosive be manipulated by the force they can hold your hand out and focus your energy on the rock to catch it catch with the force you can and redirect it yes catch it oh catch the rock strong in the force
[27:26.30]Am I trying to hit you on the head?
[27:29.71]Okay.
[27:29.85]Not bad.
[27:30.25]I don't even need any more training.
[27:38.79]I gotta stop walking forward.
[27:40.36]I'm just like wandering around like an idiot.
[27:52.13]The Force is a valuable ally, but so too is cunning.
[27:56.68]Reflect before you act.
[27:59.66]Oh, here we go.
[28:07.64]Here comes the Senate Sith.
[28:14.44]That's it.
[28:14.66]If you've never seen Star Wars before.
[28:16.46]Roger, Roger.
[28:20.83]It's literally like, it's just too much.
[28:22.71]That was it.
[28:24.35]I took out the whole thing.
[28:30.33]Yeah, Star Wars, it's a whole thing.
[28:32.09]This is like 30, 40 books.
[28:43.79]A lot of people say, oh, but the Star Wars movies, no, it's based on, like, 50 novels.
[28:49.21]And they're all, like, a thousand pages long.
[28:50.93]It's just, it's a lot.
[28:53.47]The books, you know, they're alright.
[28:55.89]But if you really want to get the whole thing, you gotta read them all.
[29:04.27]The movies really condense everything down way too much.
[29:08.52]I think the first, uh, so Episode 4, which is, uh, Star Wars Episode 4, A Lost City.
[29:16.46]It's, it's like, I think the, it's like the middle 30 books, like, there's like 20, book 20 to book 35.
[29:23.00]He released all the books out of order, too, which everyone was like, what the fuck is this?
[29:28.42]Like, it was episode, book 20 came out in 1970 or something.
[29:31.38]We were like, why?
[29:36.22]You see how much that doesn't make any sense when you talk about other pieces of media?
[29:39.20]George!
[29:39.38]This thing's gonna explode.
[29:43.41]Oh, I thought we were gonna do it.
[29:57.18]I thought it was just gonna blow.
[30:06.89]Well, is this gonna kill us both?
[30:10.01]Line up behind your target.
[30:11.69]Lacking armor, they are.
[30:22.01]Quick, Yoda, bail.
[30:23.73]Bail out Yoda.
[30:24.97]Go find us a motorcycle.
[30:32.84]Push forward, young one.
[30:36.34]Actually, controls pretty good.
[30:43.56]How do you break?
[30:44.98]Thank god there's a shield, otherwise, a regenerating shield.
[31:02.30]Otherwise, Yoda, we would be in some shit right now.
[31:15.64]Right.
[31:16.56]Not bad.
[31:20.11]No, there's more.
[31:20.65]This is the boss.
[31:22.95]Boss ship!
[31:32.05]Is it telegraphing on the ground?
[31:33.23]That makes this a lot easier, I guess.
[31:43.75]Don't!
[31:44.29]Thank God.
[31:46.49]Ugh.
[31:48.33]I did Advanced Difficulty too, didn't I?
[31:57.30]Now he finally says something.
[32:02.98]Look at the trees!
[32:05.48]Oh, sorry Yoda, I thought that I was gonna drive into them.
[32:07.56]Holy shit.
[32:14.08]That goes a great way!
[32:15.00]I'll talk to you in front of me, I don't care about that.
[32:27.13]Break!
[32:42.15]Alright, so Yoda's gonna jump off and slash him?
[32:48.36]Oh, we just got to get that last little scene.
[32:51.90]That's pretty cool.
[33:04.11]Break the disk?
[33:10.26]I'm not going to shred every connect disk.
[33:12.34]I'm going to hook out of constant contact.
[33:40.23]Well, shoot them!
[33:43.29]If I'm gonna break, you need to shoot.
[33:55.49]Alright, I was supposed to go that way.
[34:02.58]There's a thing with Wave Bracer.
[34:04.94]This reminds me of it.
[34:11.91]Alright, I'm done with the racing around shooting.
[34:21.61]Can we do anything else here?
[34:24.33]I can't see.
[34:26.68]This is a blur.
[34:27.96]It's a blur.
[34:34.84]I swear to God, it's a blur.
[34:41.13]That was all the same thing I see.
[34:51.61]What the fuck?! !
[35:11.95]Did it break?
[35:14.40]No, fuck!
[35:15.30]Thank god this save stayed.
[35:16.22]It's ten seconds to shoot.
[35:21.64]Let's do it.
[35:40.14]Slice it.
[35:40.60]Good job, Yoda.
[35:41.00]We make a great team.
[35:43.38]They should make a movie about us.
[35:45.20]Don't worry, they will.
[35:46.44]They will.
[35:47.13]Alright, that wasn't very fun.
[35:48.33]I don't think that was very fun at all.
[36:18.18]I like the Jedi stuff.
[36:22.34]I think I know why the Kinect failed.
[36:25.74]Because 75% of every single Kinect game is dodge left or dodge right.
[36:32.18]That's it.
[36:32.48]They didn't do anything else.
[36:36.70]Go like this or go like that.
[36:38.68]That's almost every single one of these.
[36:46.18]And sometimes go like this.
[36:55.14]I'm here, right?
[36:55.56]Alright, this is what I wanted to do.
[37:20.04]I feel like I played Harry Potter the exact same way.
[37:24.66]This is deflecting.
[37:27.80]Alright, now go in!
[37:30.64]You missed one on your right!
[37:35.24]Get over here.
[37:36.21]Come here.
[37:50.11]I had a chance.
[37:59.98]Didn't work.
[38:05.32]Only vault, only friends.
[38:08.38]I want to do an actual deflect like that.
[38:18.80]It's on rails.
[38:30.26]I can do that too.
[38:38.19]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[38:42.01]I can actually play.
[39:00.45]Wait, no.
[39:13.78]This is kind of a pathetic Jedi.
[39:16.28]You can't take out one droid with a stick.
[39:19.90]You probably need to go back to school.
[39:39.33]Alright, those guys have armor.
[39:42.81]I'll handle this.
[39:48.23]He's coming in.
[39:51.81]That arm looks like it's going to explode.
[40:11.59]That was like, just let me walk through.
[40:12.99]Did you really have to have that?
[40:15.83]Alright, here comes boss, I think.
[40:34.36]Oh, Chewbacca!
[40:35.62]Chewbacca is dead!
[40:38.96]Oh shit!
[40:58.00]Right in the head.
[40:59.30]Oh, that was terrible.
[41:05.86]That was awful.
[41:08.13]That's not canon.
[41:10.07]This is an expanded universe.
[41:49.45]They're all, they're alright.
[41:50.71]They're all looking.
[41:51.55]How do you do figure eight?
[42:01.78]Figure eight.
[42:03.66]Figure eight.
[42:06.99]My brain can't do it when I hear the sound.
[42:16.53]Oh.
[42:16.88]Oh.
[42:17.76]Padawan, glad you could join us.
[42:19.62]Your training has served you well, but we're not done here.
[42:22.49]The Wookiees need our help.
[42:23.73]Come on.
[42:26.01]Careful.
[42:27.71]V2s are slow, but they pack a punch.
[42:39.22]Nine...
[42:47.52]I didn't do anything.
[42:48.96]I just stood behind and just looked like I was doing something.
[42:54.48]We were all carrying the sofa, like six of us, and I was just putting my fingertips on her pretending.
[43:00.12]Where's my lightsaber?
[43:04.29]Oh, right.
[43:11.09]He's alright.
[43:12.95]He's alright.
[43:17.03]He's okay.
[43:19.15]He's gonna be fine.
[43:28.51]I actually have to do this.
[43:29.39]That's actually part of what I have to do.
[43:37.12]No!
[43:37.68]I want to get an ice cream, Mom!
[43:39.38]Ugh!
[43:41.61]Fought like a true Jedi.
[43:44.92]There's a path to the beach.
[43:46.26]Stay calm, remember your training.
[44:11.44]This is how actors look, right?
[44:13.54]This is, alright, I just like kill stole.
[44:19.19]The actors just do this shit in front of a green screen, they just, and action, and they just go like this.
[44:26.47]And then like a six million dollars worth of CG and editing goes into that and makes it look awesome.
[44:32.77]Go look at any behind the scenes footage from any movie you've ever seen in your whole life that had action in it, it's like this.
[44:45.20]It doesn't even look real.
[44:46.70]Like, all the millions of dollars that make it, like, fucking fly everywhere.
[44:50.34]It's ridiculous.
[44:51.26]What do I do?
[45:02.38]Now what?
[45:06.24]Oh, jump.
[45:14.22]Just barely made it.
[45:15.18]Did I get it?
[45:21.30]Good job.
[45:22.19]Look at the actor and look at the action.
[45:24.25]Right?
[45:24.53]I told you.
[45:24.87]Good job.
[45:56.12]She just killed like five people on our team.
[45:58.74]Just saying.
[46:14.65]I think I missed my opportunity.
[46:16.46]I think I missed the opportunity.
[46:18.44]Why am I jogging?
[46:30.17]Remember your training.
[46:32.51]Reflect those bolts with your saber.
[46:39.59]Figure eights.
[46:40.07]Figure eights.
[46:40.79]I guess I'm thinking about it.
[46:41.87]I fuck it up every time I think about it.
[46:46.50]Jump!
[46:49.94]Stay focused.
[47:11.21]That was on her.
[47:12.29]That wasn't even on me.
[47:13.21]That was on her.
[47:15.97]She missed that one.
[47:28.52]I just saved your life.
[47:30.96]Turn around!
[47:31.94]Are you fucking serious?
[47:43.15]I can't wait till the fucking music goes
[48:17.22]How the fuck do I go over there?
[48:59.26]Hey!
[48:59.70]That's...low.
[49:51.26]Why flip?
[49:52.22]Why not just leap?
[49:53.38]Why not, like, step over and land safely?
[49:55.82]Why flip?
[49:56.84]You can't see where the fuck you're landing.
[50:02.04]Imagine trusting the fact that you're gonna do a full rotation and land on your feet.
[50:11.69]Or you just don't.
[50:13.73]What if you just miscalculate and you're going forward and you just land on your back?
[50:19.88]That's when baseball players do something stupid and they end up on the disabled list for 15-30 days.
[50:25.08]That's the type of shit that you do when you're a Jedi.
[50:27.02]You end up on the fucking DL.
[50:28.76]But the Trandoshans are predators.
[50:30.86]Bounty hunters.
[50:33.78]This was no hunting party.
[50:35.40]It was a full-scale army.
[50:36.86]They had a fleet.
[50:39.32]They have to have a list, guys.
[50:40.62]Really?
[50:40.84]Exactly.
[50:42.18]This was nothing like their previous attacks.
[50:45.04]And whoever's supplying them is also jamming external communications.
[50:51.17]I can't believe we transitioned to dancing.
[50:52.65]I was going to do a Chewie, but it might have been a really, really embarrassing Chewie.
[51:00.16]Let me test it behind you.
[51:01.76]Let me just test it and see.
[51:22.44]As long as you don't see my face, I can do it.
[51:30.04]As long as you don't look at me.
[51:31.48]I just didn't think it would happen this soon.
[51:36.25]See, if it was in front of the camera, I would back out.
[51:45.99]Ready yourselves.
[51:47.63]Their staffs are deadly.
[52:02.45]How come nobody's ever decided to do the Strangle to Darth Vader?
[52:05.27]You know?
[52:07.00]Why wouldn't Obi-Wan just go like this and start strangling Darth Vader?
[52:19.15]They both just... It has a better grip at that point, I think.
[52:28.37]Just do that to the Emperor!
[52:29.50]What's he gonna do?
[52:30.65]I will electrocute you, do the Darth Vader.
[52:34.09]You got an old man by the throat.
[52:35.35]He's not gonna be able to shoot you with electricity.
[52:44.36]Fuck that dude.
[52:44.98]I would just, instead of using, I would just stone cold stun people like I did before.
[52:50.32]You know, get them like around the neck like this and then like stun them.
[52:55.89]And they would go, boom, and they would launch up.
[52:58.61]It would be fucking awesome.
[53:05.16]Come on, let's go.
[53:06.78]Now all of a sudden you don't... Got it.
[53:09.96]You and me.
[53:14.26]You and me.
[53:41.08]Did I just hit the lady behind me?
[53:44.42]I just, like, rerided the lady.
[53:47.34]We must hurry.
[53:49.36]The Wookiees need our help launching the fluttercraft.
[53:54.84]Jump quickly, Patamos.
[53:58.10]Move quickly.
[53:58.72]The Wookiees need our help.
[54:08.90]See?
[54:09.40]Just do that.
[54:13.89]As a Jedi, you don't have mana.
[54:33.25]Think about that.
[54:34.14]These motherfuckers waste all their time learning how to sword fight like from the 1700s.
[54:39.46]Just go like this and throw people off a cliff.
[54:42.80]What's the point of that?
[54:46.75]Just go like this and push a whole army off a fucking bridge.
[54:54.64]Why would you ever get close for any reason?
[55:01.07]This is tiring.
[55:01.93]You get tired doing this shit for more than five minutes.
[55:04.03]I just gotta hold my hand out and just concentrate like I'm doing a fucking crossword puzzle and I can throw somebody off a bridge?
[55:12.83]Get to the fluttercraft.
[55:22.40]Just for real?
[55:22.94]Why?
[55:24.74]It looks cool.
[55:25.38]Am I alright?
[55:26.98]Can you stand?
[55:28.02]We have to get off this platform.
[55:29.36]It won't hold much longer.
[55:35.77]I mean, the only thing I can think of that would be a problem when doing this is just the trope in every single piece of media.
[55:49.45]A slight nosebleed.
[55:53.08]Oh no!
[55:53.58]I did it too long!
[55:57.94]I'll be fine in a second.
[55:59.58]Protect them at all costs.
[56:09.60]Why don't they bleed from their eyes?
[56:12.88]You really want to give some real gravity to that situation?
[56:15.70]Blood out of the eyes.
[56:17.00]And it's like, blood, blink, blink, blink, red, blood in the eyes, and you can't see.
[56:25.07]Then it'll be like, whoa, shit, you don't want to do that.
[56:27.69]You don't want to do that shit.
[56:28.41]It'll move in a minute.
[56:30.71]You won't be able to see.
[56:37.28]Oh shit, it's been 57 minutes.
[56:38.92]I thought it was supposed to be done in 30.
[56:42.41]We're supposed to only give everyone in these 30 minutes.
[56:44.07]Oops.
[56:44.21]It's me, I'm here.
[56:44.69]Let me just finish this and I'll do one dance.
[56:46.83]Actually, no, I can't do a dance.
[56:48.31]Sorry guys, it's been 57 minutes.
[57:05.39]Yeah, I don't know, I'm only allowed to give them water, you know?
[57:09.76]Alright, that's it.
[57:10.92]That's it.
[57:16.02]I still don't understand that.
[57:18.68]It's like... Oh, Chewie!
[57:30.83]Chewie!
[57:31.39]CHEWIE!
[57:38.36]Joey!
[57:41.98]I'm way ahead.
[57:52.50]The explosion.
[57:53.04]The explosion lost me.
[57:56.54]I didn't do that.
[57:57.46]That was the explosion on my back.
[58:16.25]Yeah, fuck that man.
[58:20.84]I would just get a suit of armor.
[58:23.82]I would be in like a steel full suit of armor just holding my hands out.
[58:33.92]I would be a caster.
[58:47.96]That was more embarrassing for you than it was cool for me.
[58:51.27]I will say.
[59:01.57]Chewie!
[59:02.63]Don't do it, Chewie!
[59:09.94]Chewie!
[59:28.04]What the fuck?
[59:33.02]Stupid-ass blaine.
[60:06.38]Am I good?
[60:07.70]Alright, I'm good.
[60:11.00]Do a Jar Jar?
[60:11.80]I can't do a Jar Jar.
[60:15.56]What's that Chewie doing on the left?
[60:22.27]This Chewie on the left, I think he has, like, sand in his eyes.
[60:35.17]Let's make him think he did that.
[60:40.41]This shit don't fucking do anything.
[61:09.27]Sign me up.
[61:11.23]I'm great at parties.
[61:14.06]How's Harry?
[61:19.32]Controlled, although might need to re-tie it up here.
[61:27.89]Next, next, hold on.
[61:31.51]I can't quit mid-game.
[61:34.79]I'm gonna do this and then I'll dance for you guys.
[61:43.23]I'll dance.
[61:45.69]I need to get the boss.
[61:48.69]It's Darth Vader.
[61:50.37]He's the boss in every one of the video games.
[61:53.80]It's not going to be anybody else.
[61:58.04]It's just going to show up.
[61:59.04]It's going to be a one-on-one scenario.
[62:08.95]Am I driving the...
[62:24.06]How about you do something?
[62:26.07]How about you do something?
[62:30.01]I have to do the work for both of us?
[62:37.72]I know that you just had your hands lightly on it.
[62:55.42]Nice work.
[63:03.97]Did he just do a Chewie?
[63:10.17]Do the lizard people have Chewie signs?
[63:35.09]Now what?
[63:40.76]Darth Vader.
[63:44.70]This is tricky.
[63:57.61]Tricky here.
[64:05.91]Grab somebody.
[64:13.42]Alright, we're good.
[64:22.63]Yeah!
[64:28.59]Oh no, they must... Pop that one quick.
[64:34.96]I don't want to fuck this up, I really don't.
[64:45.69]God.
[64:46.91]See you later.
[64:48.39]That guy was expendable.
[64:49.93]I'm here, I'm fine.
[64:55.07]This is so stupid.
[65:04.28]They didn't tell me duck.
[65:05.94]Did it on an instinct.
[65:06.75]Put the saber down.
[65:08.43]Blind?
[65:10.61]Easy.
[65:15.53]Got it.
[65:33.83]Fine, Xbox.
[65:35.77]I need a full... I need three servings of oatmeal before this screen.
[65:39.84]I'll be alright.
[65:53.75]Oh my god.
[66:13.51]Was that supposed to happen?
[66:20.73]Is this like another part of the scene?
[66:41.48]Uh, what do we do now?
[66:49.50]Get off!
[67:03.57]I got mine, get yours, hurry up!
[67:16.73]When will it end?
[67:19.75]When you hear off-camera... And he steps in and he goes... One-on-one.
[67:34.74]Here it comes.
[67:41.35]He'll block five of his attacks.
[67:46.26]And then there'll be an explosion in the hangar and I'll take care of you next time.
[67:51.19]Non-canon dickhead and he'll just walk away.
[68:19.41]This is a long chapter.
[68:27.06]This is the Clone Wars.
[68:28.18]That doesn't matter.
[68:28.92]You think that matters?
[68:34.84]Darth Vader could be eight right now and he's still gonna walk out like eight feet tall.
[68:51.25]Where's the... Oh, it's the twins!
[68:56.53]Now this is a fight.
[68:57.41]This is the two twins.
[69:00.21]Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
[69:01.93]What am I going to do?
[69:22.31]First base, down.
[69:55.03]What was that?
[70:12.91]How is he fucking hitting me?
[70:15.65]How is he hitting me?

[125:52.08]Awesome, awesome, awesome.

[127:04.97]Nice.
[127:07.53]Why would you change this song?
[127:10.19]What?
[127:20.29]Why'd they need to change that?
[127:24.51]Rangers Forever?
[127:25.50]That's weird.

[129:27.04]Ralph.
[129:27.78]I don't know what the Red Ranger's name is.

[130:04.59]Is that what they look like?
[130:05.39]That looks like a kid's Halloween costume.
[130:08.17]You could get that in the spirit of Halloween and like the party store.
[130:16.36]That's what they did.
[130:19.22]They were like, they were like iron.
[130:21.60]Whoa.

[131:29.88]This is probably the best game I've ever played.
[131:46.18]Let's go.
[131:48.04]Alright, Mouth Guy.
[131:51.32]It's just a lightsaber game again.

[138:30.99]This is great.
[138:33.53]This was great.
[138:34.93]If I was 13,
[138:45.59]I thought each one was an individual little story.
[138:53.93]I like that.
[139:27.84]We had the mouth guy, now we have the hand guy.

[142:54.11]Oooh.
[142:55.45]That feels good.
[142:56.03]Did it bite the hand?
[143:06.87]No, I think it's going to bite the hand.
[143:11.31]No, I don't.
[143:11.63]I just, like, slap.
[143:15.08]This hand is done.
[143:16.20]This arm is done.
[143:19.74]I can't, I, I, I can't do it anymore with this arm.
[143:24.34]Let's do this thing!
[143:28.96]I've been waiting for you strangers.
[143:35.86]When you hear the music, I just have to do it.

[145:35.30]Make sure you do it a little looser.
[145:37.84]That's better!
[145:39.72]Samurai Megazord, we are united!
[145:42.59]What do you got to say about that?
[146:07.11]It's time to kick your ass
[146:43.50]It's fucking up the sensor.
[146:51.99]It thinks my body's like three times longer.
[147:07.65]What?
[147:08.29]What?
[147:10.99]Jerry!
[147:13.73]We gotta do it together!
[147:16.95]Sorry, I'm sorry!
[147:20.15]Why did you make it like this?
[147:21.31]Why couldn't you just do the command?
[147:22.64]Slice the wrong way?
[147:43.55]But when you look at it, remember, I'll mirror it.
[147:46.43]Flame Badge.
[147:48.39]Flame Badge.
[147:50.45]Next.
[147:58.78]I gotta go refill that water right after this one.
[148:13.62]Go, go, Gerber Ranger.
[148:14.78]I'm trying.
[148:15.20]Oh, here they are now.
[148:25.34]Samurizer.
[148:27.35]Go, go, Samurai.
[148:28.15]I don't want that.
[148:30.19]I want to get that on camera.
[148:31.69]Whatever.
[148:33.41]Write your symbol to one.
[148:47.11]Green Tongue, activate!
[148:48.31]Samurai Rangers ready!
[149:09.08]Rangers together!
[149:11.67]Samurai forever!
[149:13.37]I have to use my right hand as a weapon because it's hard for me to do this now.
[149:17.23]I'm losing circulation here.
[149:20.43]I'm going to pick up my right hand and use it.
[149:23.48]Like this.
[149:23.86]Because I have no strength.
[149:36.00]That works.
[149:41.22]He's weak.
[149:46.04]I've been in the middle of an exercise for two and a half hours!
[149:54.27]I can't do it, I have to do it.
[150:33.17]Slice it.
[150:42.36]I dodged it!
[150:42.96]Why would you step back?
[150:44.12]I just got a double tap.
[151:25.24]Alright, here we go.
[151:35.73]Lights are off.
[151:37.55]Holy shit.
[151:58.96]You saw me, dog.
[152:03.94]Here we go.
[152:09.10]Staff activated.
[152:12.85]We're looking at him right after him.
[152:15.61]Alright.
[152:33.75]boss alright let's go three three fight I don't have any uh I don't have a power up yet oh
[153:09.11]Don't go in.
[153:10.35]Now wait.
[153:18.45]Don't get hit.
[153:18.93]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[153:21.27]I can't get hit by this.
[153:23.58]Which way is he gonna go?
[153:25.22]Left or right?
[153:30.12]Did he do it again?
[153:34.32]I can't... Get over there!
[153:37.04]Get over there, you fucking idiot!
[153:55.79]Recharge the Rangers to bring them to their feet.
[154:03.65]Just a little more.
[154:06.21]Well done.
[154:06.56]Now you can fight.
[154:13.00]Thank God it's the children.
[154:17.44]It's not alright, boy.
[154:31.46]Nice I thought that was another camera pointing at me.
[154:48.02]I was like who put a fucking camera in my room
[154:55.39]It was, like, facing me this way.
[154:56.83]I was like, why is there a camera in here?
[155:05.19]No, uh, Megazord?
[155:07.57]Next.
[155:07.91]Why was there no Megazord?
[155:10.17]Alright, after this one, we're gonna have to do a, uh, killer one.
[155:22.65]I'm gonna slow it down a little.
[155:36.24]I gave up.
[155:41.72]I don't have any energy to do that.
[155:44.60]This is what I do.
[155:45.72]That's what I do.
[155:48.42]You know, that doesn't do anything.
[155:49.88]That doesn't have any powers.
[155:51.47]It's just what they chose to do for that particular moment.
[155:54.41]So just because I choose to go like this doesn't mean that I'm not as strong.
[156:00.55]That doesn't do anything.
[156:04.89]That's just for show.
[156:05.77]Let's get that clear.
[156:14.27]Alright, so it's not this way.
[156:16.53]It's
[156:17.42]this way, right?
[156:20.26]I'm gonna try to get it first try.
[156:30.41]Go, go, Samurai!
[156:32.05]You like this?
[156:48.95]Right.
[156:51.17]That was really cool.
[156:53.23]Yeah.
[156:54.25]I think you can dunk with the Megazord.
[156:59.44]One more hit and it's done.
[157:04.84]Flash.
[157:10.50]You like this?
[157:32.74]Pink Ranger split that up.
[157:39.74]Not very good over there.
[157:40.54]I did it right this time.
[157:50.73]Victory is ours!
[157:53.37]What an awesome show that this was.
[157:55.09]That was great.
[158:01.71]I loved that.
[158:03.18]I love that.
[158:03.84]I love this one.
[158:11.91]The show was bad?
[158:12.87]How did you say that?
[158:21.18]I also missed subs.
[158:23.36]Bitslave gave 10 community subs earlier.
[158:25.64]Thank you, Bitslave.
[158:27.20]Ooh, that was like 30 minutes ago.
[158:29.64]Whoops.
[158:30.88]I am an idiot.
[158:32.40]But thank you for the 10 subs.
[158:35.73]Dropping 10 subs tonight.
[158:39.01]Today.
[158:39.31]Whatever time it is.
[158:40.71]Let's do one more.
[158:41.61]Last one.
[158:46.62]The original show was great.
[158:48.52]I grew up on that show.
[158:52.24]They had, like, inside the Honker Burger, right?
[158:55.67]They did it at the restaurant.
[158:56.47]They would eat and hang out, and the American actors only recorded the inside, the restaurant scenes.
[159:02.27]And, like, reactions outside.
[159:03.75]Please don't hurt me!
[159:06.21]Get out of my way!
[159:09.04]Let's go!
[159:17.21]It's time to finish this.
[159:20.25]I dodged it!
[159:20.63]Samurizer!
[159:21.55]Go go Samurai!
[159:27.08]Write your symbol tomorrow!
[159:53.69]Why won't it go?
[160:10.88]That's like at a wedding fucking photographer what the fuck are you doing?
[160:16.97]You got it in like drunk uncle Frank was falling up when he was like juggling upside down Damn it
[160:38.06]I was going to go straight up in the air, but like literally you would have just like my, my fucking reverse upper body underwear would have come up.
[160:49.53]The T-pose.
[160:51.87]The T-pose.
[160:55.35]A little blood like rushed through my head.
[160:56.65]I don't know how people stay upside down for that long.
[161:08.39]Alright, last one, and then I'm going to get some water, and we're going to move on to a relaxing one.
[161:12.28]Today, you will fall to my sword, my son.
[161:15.27]Ooh, this is just going right in.
[161:37.47]Excellent.
[161:38.67]That was kinda cool.
[161:44.77]Alright, watch it.
[161:46.21]Let's dodge.
[161:50.03]Yeah, here we go.
[162:07.42]Can I get into him?
[162:08.80]No.
[162:16.48]Alright, here comes a bottom slash, right?
[163:04.93]What?
[163:05.19]I can't hear him.
[163:09.84]The connect is broken.
[163:24.93]The connect is broken.
[163:33.40]It doesn't work!
[163:34.16]It's because it says, yes, I got the wrong calibration.
[164:32.17]Get outta here!
[164:43.09]I gotta recalibrate the head.
[164:54.08]Water retie this splash flash moisturize Dump like a cup of water down my pants See that's bullshit I'm not even getting the points on my id I got fired
[165:29.49]I got recast.
[165:32.83]Re, uh, casting call.
[165:37.73]How interesting.
[165:42.07]You want some of this?
[165:46.77]I already switched.
[165:48.03]I did, I switched.
[165:48.91]My training was last weekend.
[165:50.17]Don't go samurai.
[165:51.79]Okay.
[165:56.17]Write your symbol to warn.
[166:14.91]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[166:17.25]I ain't doing another one.
[166:19.95]Q, R, S, T, U, V.
[166:39.73]We're back.
[166:43.58]He said the line.
[166:44.26]He did.
[166:45.62]Sometimes he does.
[166:46.56]Alright.
[166:46.90]Give me some water.
[166:53.06]I'll be back in like two minutes, three minutes.
[166:55.09]I'm going to go pee.
[166:58.99]Please do QRS again.
[167:00.23]I can't.
[167:03.55]That was a night that will...
[167:07.50]I could never do that again, I don't think.
[167:09.10]It was just... I can't replicate that ever again.
[167:16.42]I can try to emulate the thing, like, oh, it's not, no way.
[167:22.07]I can't emulate that.
[167:25.19]Sweat check?
[167:30.11]No, it's alright.
[167:31.03]I mean, I'm a little, I got some film on me, but it's fine.
[167:35.97]I'll be right back.
[167:37.31]We're going to chill out.
[167:39.48]We're going to do a slow-paced one.
[167:40.94]See you in a minute.
[172:04.69]I'm back.
[172:06.57]Okay.
[172:08.13]So, we've done some intensity.
[172:12.10]I think it's time to do something where we just hang out and get through one of these more relaxed ones.
[172:27.93]Family feud?
[172:28.59]No.
[172:30.21]Something far worse.
[172:43.22]It's not Disney again, I promise.
[172:54.45]I redid the hair.
[172:56.47]Splash some water.
[172:59.41]I dumped a whole soda down here.
[173:05.70]Right, probably should put this in.
[173:09.70]This Bluetooth headset actually goes pretty far.
[173:13.14]I could hear everything you guys were saying.
[173:15.84]Some of them were more nice than other rude comments, but... Speaking of not being able to hear things, why can I not hear it now?
[173:33.85]Power off.
[173:35.51]What do you mean, power off?
[173:48.09]Women, power off.
[173:49.55]Hold up your arm and wave at the screen to begin.
[174:00.94]Power on.
[174:03.70]Battery fully charged.
[174:05.04]It's talking to me.
[174:06.98]I have my own, like, Iron Man suit in here.
[174:08.68]Okay, so Bluetooth connected.
[174:12.67]Now, there we are.
[174:15.49]So this is called Fantastic Pets and Where to Find Them.
[174:24.18]Hopefully not in a movie theater, because that series is bad.
[174:30.00]Okay, welcome to the game, Tender Dragoon 74.
[174:38.01]That was an easy joke.
[174:43.60]Continue with this gamer profile.
[174:46.50]Hey there.
[174:47.48]Welcome to the game.
[174:50.74]I told you we were going to relax on this one.
[174:52.64]This is just for me to catch my breath for like 12 minutes.
[174:58.82]And then we'll play in a horror game.
[175:03.68]This is you make your own pet.
[175:06.35]Like a... The thing in your hand.
[175:10.93]Visitor detected.
[175:13.29]Hi there.
[175:14.28]I've been expecting you.
[175:16.10]Welcome to Dr. Menagerie's house.
[175:18.88]I'm a natural interface entity, but you can call me Natalie.
[175:24.93]This house belongs to Dr. Menagerie.
[175:27.97]He's an expert in fantastic pets.
[175:31.43]Also, he's your uncle.
[175:34.26]I probably should have mentioned that first.
[175:38.08]Anyway, Dr. Menagerie isn't here right now, but he left you a message.
[175:41.70]Cats, dogs, animals, dragons in the same house in the same room?
[175:51.83]Imagine, it must stink in here.
[175:53.85]Hello, hello.
[175:54.15]I don't suppose you remember me, but it has been a long time.
[175:57.29]I'm your uncle, Dr. Menagerie.
[175:59.15]I'm a doctoral zoologist.
[176:00.65]That's the study of how animals and humans interact and live with each other.
[176:04.49]It's fascinating work, and it takes me all over the world in search of rare and fantastic species, which is why I'm sending you this message.
[176:11.70]There are loads of rare and exotic animals living in my house, and I need... I'm afraid you're a little too close.
[176:18.92]Try moving back.
[176:22.29]So, head over to the house and choose your first pet.
[176:25.35]Oh, by the way, you'll meet Natalie there.
[176:27.79]She'll help you along.
[176:29.12]Can't he tell me that?
[176:30.88]Good luck, and have fun.
[176:34.58]Why can't he just say, hey, back up?
[176:37.98]He stops talking?
[176:39.82]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[176:40.50]Easy over there.
[176:42.13]You can spend as long as you like with each pet before choosing one to take home with you.
[176:54.01]The door's just open?
[176:57.01]We have all sorts of pets here, from cats, dogs, ponies, and lizards, to the rare and secret fantastic pets.
[177:05.80]These are animals the rest of the world doesn't know about, like dragons or unicorns.
[177:13.04]By the way, the reason you can't see me is that I'm a computer.
[177:17.79]I'm the house you're in, I suppose.
[177:19.23]It's my job to help your uncle look after all the pets that decide to come home with him.
[177:24.43]Kisses over there.
[177:25.19]Dragon, like, takes a dump in the corner.
[177:28.09]There's, like, puke in the corner.
[177:29.33]Like, pee.
[177:32.33]Okay.
[177:33.25]On to the main event.
[177:35.03]The pets.
[177:40.43]Don't act like that's not what would happen here.
[177:45.49]What clean grass you got?
[177:47.19]Look at your carpets.
[177:48.41]That's why you got hardwoods installed.
[177:51.55]There's like 40 pets walking around.
[177:52.65]With the door open.
[177:53.69]There is probably like a shit log hidden behind a lamp somewhere in this house.
[177:56.97]Alright, what do I want?
[177:58.29]Cat, dog, unicorn, or lizard.
[178:15.80]lizard pool to help you choose your uncle has left you a file on each of the pets that you can choose to adopt oh look at him hello nomad nomad joined us from the deserts of Africa where she spent her days sunbathing apparently nomad decided to leave the desert because she was fed up with sand getting into everything
[178:38.57]Oh, that's so cute.
[178:40.07]Okay, uh, I don't know who to choose.
[178:41.70]Okay, let's get, I need to get, uh, uh, a prop on the house.
[178:44.02]This is Sadie.
[178:44.66]Alright, let's see what I want in Sadie's store.
[178:52.42]Say hello to one of our most mischievous pets, Sadie.
[178:56.40]Sadie loves to see what's going on behind the scenes, and to figure out how things work, so she's always getting into trouble.
[179:05.41]I saw the leg!
[179:06.99]Okay, always getting into trouble.
[179:20.04]This is one of our newest additions she loves all types of extreme sports Have you ever seen a snowboarding lizard?
[179:29.53]just in
[179:34.56]And the bat flip, I did three of those when the stream started.
[179:36.98]I think that might be the one.
[179:38.18]We gotta get them all.
[179:41.49]Timmy.
[179:47.84]Right up close to the camera.
[179:49.74]Funny star.
[179:50.54]It's the funny one.
[179:53.96]Believe it or not, Timmy is one of our shyest pets.
[179:57.42]He's a little wary of new people, but if you become friends, then you'll never see a more loyal, dedicated pet than Timmy.
[180:05.29]I don't think it's gonna be Tim- I think it's gonna be Ember.
[180:16.39]Ah, yes.
[180:17.03]This is Drake, one of our miniature dragons.
[180:20.33]He may be small, but he's still pretty wild.
[180:23.53]Just watch him fend off a fearsome squeaky toy.
[180:27.02]Strong.
[180:30.72]Ember.
[180:31.52]I've chosen.
[180:35.32]Handstand backflips.
[180:36.20]It's going to be Ember.
[180:41.18]Ember's love of extreme sports has made her completely fearless.
[180:45.47]Natalie says that watching Ember's stunting- Okay.
[180:48.23]Looks like you know who- You're happy that this is the guy you want to take home?
[180:52.36]Yep.
[180:54.14]Yasuo?
[181:15.55]It's too easy.
[181:19.95]Wait.
[181:20.45]Yes.
[181:21.25]No.
[181:22.17]Hang on.
[181:22.59]Nearly there.
[181:23.09]Aha!
[181:24.45]Hello.
[181:25.27]My systems have transferred perfectly.
[181:27.45]Ooh, nice place you've got here.
[181:31.02]Very chic.
[181:31.54]Thank you.
[181:32.66]Very chic.
[181:33.00]You like what I'm playing with here?
[181:34.68]As this is your first time playing, let's run through a few handy hints, shall we?
[181:39.26]This is the area you need to play the game in.
[181:42.14]If you go outside the area, I might lose sight of you.
[181:46.45]Are you sure you've cleared enough space in front of the TV to play in?
[181:49.60]Any objects in the way could cause problems
[181:55.78]Remember I told you?
[181:56.34]Remember I told you?
[181:57.34]I told you.
[181:57.84]What did I fucking tell you?
[181:58.54]Ah, here we are.
[181:59.52]What did I tell you?
[182:00.34]You're too close.
[182:01.82]Remember I said about fucking CGI in movies and how like the guy that boom was really an idiot and all of a sudden he has these spells?
[182:06.63]Check this out.
[182:07.15]Yes, they definitely like it here.
[182:11.15]Oh yes, I nearly forgot something.
[182:13.91]Which is ironic considering I'm a computer.
[182:15.97]Told you.
[182:17.22]This is Avatar, one of Dr. Menagerie's assistants.
[182:21.69]Avatar helps out by acting as my hands.
[182:24.99]Because computers don't have hands of their own, see?
[182:31.14]Try calling your pet over to you.
[182:34.04]You can do it just like you would with a real pet.
[182:37.12]You see how Avatar is showing you how to call your pet over?
[182:40.74]Whenever you see, perfect.
[182:42.90]Now you can call your pet whenever you like.
[182:45.36]There are lots of other commands you can give to your pet too.
[182:48.74]So try plenty of things out.
[182:53.82]Now let's try a toy, shall we?
[182:55.69]Let's get a toy!
[182:57.07]Let's see.
[182:57.83]Aha!
[182:59.43]The Bubble Bubbler, I think.
[183:01.99]The Bubble Bubbler.
[183:03.55]Play with bubbles by popping and swirling them around.
[183:08.22]Pop the bubbles?
[183:11.32]Hey!
[183:13.40]Go!
[183:16.06]Help me pop these!
[183:17.92]The more bubbles the Bubble Bubbler creates.
[183:20.13]I don't want to...
[183:23.73]The faster you move around, the more bubbles the Bubble Bubbler creates.
[183:30.97]You're going to get me in trouble.
[183:32.01]I'm going to fall.
[183:36.30]Can you get one?
[183:37.04]You get one too.
[183:39.46]These are mine.
[183:42.28]I'm destroying you.
[183:44.94]Good work.
[183:46.72]Do I get food too?
[183:54.80]Try moving about.
[183:55.84]It makes the Bubble Bubbler release more bubbles.
[184:02.28]The Bubble Bubbler finished.
[184:03.84]Finished.
[184:05.38]All of the activities will finish by themselves, so you don't need to tidy them away yourself if you want to.
[184:10.21]Didn't even get one.
[184:14.51]Ember is just a baby.
[184:16.93]Hey.
[184:17.09]Hey there.
[184:21.18]What is it?
[184:21.46]These gestures appear to show you some of the ways to interact with your pet.
[184:25.12]What's up?
[184:25.74]What's up, girl?
[184:27.02]What do you want to do?
[184:27.80]Try your own gestures and see what happens.
[184:29.82]Hey.
[184:29.96]No, you can't go that way.
[184:33.44]Back over here.
[184:34.44]Hey, come here.
[184:35.30]Your pet's toys are all stored in the toy box.
[184:37.52]Come over here.
[184:38.42]So let's open that now, shall we?
[184:41.46]You can see your toy box in the top right of the screen.
[184:44.48]Come over here.
[184:44.78]To select it, hold your arm straight out to the side and up a bit.
[184:48.15]Come over here.
[184:49.05]Then just keep it there.
[184:52.01]Hey!
[184:53.62]Toys?
[185:00.49]Here we are in your pet's toy box.
[185:03.25]As you unlock more toys, they'll appear here.
[185:05.77]To let me know what you'd like to do, simply hold your hand out and a cursor will appear on the screen.
[185:11.32]To select an icon, simply hold your cursor over it and I'll do the rest.
[185:17.00]Let's try a game of Ball Fetch, shall we?
[185:19.80]Move the glowing cursor over the icon and hold it nice and still.
[185:25.16]Ball Fetch.
[185:29.73]Right, time to give your pet some exercise for the game of ball fetch.
[185:34.43]Ball fetch.
[185:37.07]Where am I?
[185:39.59]How do I take it?
[185:40.47]Reach towards the screen to take the ball from your pet.
[185:44.30]The markers on the floor display how far your last throw and your longest throw went before the ball bounced.
[185:50.62]Nice.
[185:59.86]Alright, I'm gonna throw it further.
[186:02.92]Here we go!
[186:04.38]Where'd I go?
[186:08.44]Uh, I'm permanently off- I was on camera before in-game, but I'm- I'll be back.
[186:22.44]How did I throw it further than that?
[186:24.75]I'm trying to throw it over the fence.
[186:28.47]I'm not gonna be able to do that.
[186:36.47]I'll try.
[186:36.69]Is it underhand?
[186:39.11]How did you know I was not doing it underhand?
[187:04.32]All fantastic pets love to play Ball Fetch.
[187:15.00]Ball Fetch finished.
[187:20.92]Copy the gestures Avatar is performing to get your pet to do different things.
[187:35.89]So now you've got to know your pet a little, I guess it's time I told you about Trainers Headquarters.
[187:42.43]Trainers Headquarters is an organization that looks after the fantastic pets of the world through their trainers, like you.
[187:50.12]I don't...
[188:15.02]You can increase your trainer rank by taking part in talent shows with your pet.
[188:19.82]I'll explain more about talent shows later.
[188:22.27]I'm trying a pet.
[188:30.99]Alright.
[188:32.13]Flap your arms to make your pet fly.
[188:37.20]Fly, Ember, fly!
[188:42.64]You gonna fly?
[188:45.10]Excuse me.
[188:45.52]Gem.
[188:45.62]Chaos Emerald.
[188:45.90]You've seen this?
[188:46.48]Look at that.
[189:16.97]That's really interesting, huh?
[189:17.75]You got the gem!
[189:18.97]You can use the gems you collected to unlock new activities.
[189:22.77]Each activity displays its gem cost on its icon.
[189:26.23]If you want to unlock a new toy, then simply select it.
[189:29.13]Go through my legs!
[189:31.45]Go through my legs!
[189:34.62]Point at the TV, and your pet will investigate it.
[189:44.90]You're too close.
[189:48.70]You also have a smartphone.
[189:51.29]It's a fancy way of selecting all sorts of other options and things to do in the game.
[189:56.49]Your smartphone is in the opposite corner of the display from the toy box, and you open it in exactly the same way.
[190:03.21]Just hold your arm straight out to the top left and wait a second.
[190:16.68]Get it.
[190:17.61]This is a super game.
[190:21.53]Oh, this is a super game.
[190:22.91]Oh, where'd she go?
[190:23.43]Las Vegas.
[190:23.85]Right there, Las Vegas.
[190:39.08]You could unlock new colors, tails, wings, and even come, I'm afraid you're a little too quick.
[190:44.60]I'm just trying to see.
[190:45.84]Try moving back.
[190:47.58]Russia?

[190:55.18]You guys pick.
[190:56.62]Whoa, let's try it now.
[190:58.94]Choose one of these icons to send Dr. Menagerie across the world to that continent.
[191:06.43]Whoa, you're getting a little too close.
[191:09.28]Try taking a step back.

[191:22.45]I'm afraid you're a little too close.
[191:25.23]Try moving back.
[191:26.01]Alright.
[191:27.42]Where are we going?
[191:28.58]Ready?
[191:30.76]Where?
[191:41.32]Alright, looks like we're going to... Oh, you want me to go to the frost area.
[191:54.06]Frost?
[191:55.42]This looks like it's frost to me.
[191:57.36]Yeah, that's unanimous.
[192:00.23]Thanks for clicking.
[192:01.57]Alright.
[192:22.26]How do we go there?
[192:23.02]Oh.
[192:25.74]Alright, what are we gonna get?
[192:38.63]Lost Lizard of Antarctica.
[192:39.97]Unlock with gems.
[192:44.17]It's just another lizard, though.
[192:46.09]This is... I don't want... I don't want this.
[193:03.60]Let it stay the lost.
[193:17.00]Yes, terrible.
[193:18.68]Australia.
[193:21.92]Horse.
[193:23.52]Yeah.
[193:30.98]Hello.
[193:31.70]You'll be pleased to hear that my expedition is going well.
[193:34.35]Whoa, that horse looks a little wound up.
[193:38.93]None of which have ever been seen before.
[193:40.87]Although, between you and me, I'm beginning to suspect that one of them is just a pony in a funny hat.
[193:50.03]Thank you, Bitslave, for the 10 community subs.
[193:52.50]I already said that.
[193:53.64]I'm so stupid.
[193:54.32]Thank you, though, for real.
[193:58.97]OK, let's go.
[194:00.55]The database awaits.
[194:02.65]We're going to Australia.
[194:05.31]Does that mean we're still going to be in my room?
[194:21.91]Welcome to the pet database.
[194:24.53]This is where you get to decide how your pet evolves and changes.
[194:29.03]You can choose its size and color, whether it has wings or horns, and loads of other things.
[194:36.33]Editing your pet uses up a few gems to start the pet database.
[194:40.11]But once you're inside the database, you can make as many changes as you like.
[194:44.61]Horns.
[194:44.85]Wings.
[194:45.05]Red eyes.
[194:45.29]Claws.
[194:53.28]then all the changes you've made to your pet will be undone and they won't look any different.
[194:59.16]Choose this when you're happy with the changes you've made.
[195:01.98]Alright.
[195:05.66]Let's do horns.
[195:08.94]If you choose a pet with horns, it will be more confident and proud than one without.
[195:13.82]Okay, I don't like one.
[195:14.68]I don't even know what these look like.
[195:28.38]Uh, no.
[195:28.82]Those just look like leaves.
[195:34.62]Those are devil horns.
[195:35.72]No.
[195:37.38]Uh-oh.
[195:37.78]Actually, I don't hate those.
[195:42.44]I don't hate those.
[195:43.38]Alright.
[195:44.12]No, I don't hate them.
[195:46.58]Stylish!
[195:58.47]Alright, wings.
[196:01.78]Does your pet have a pair of wings?
[196:04.02]Yes.
[196:04.38]Wings make pets more carefree.
[196:06.68]And of course, they will be able to fly.
[196:09.50]Those are like toucan wings.
[196:15.48]These are bats.
[196:17.99]I should have made Spyro the dragon.
[196:21.79]Why did I not make Spyro?
[196:30.21]Alright, we're gonna go with the bat wings.
[196:32.97]Yeah, that's cool.
[196:38.99]Let's do the skin, the coat.
[196:40.01]I can make Spyro.
[196:46.24]What does Spyro look like?
[196:47.44]He's purple.
[197:05.93]Purple and orange, right?
[197:07.85]Are his legs orange?
[197:21.01]Purple and yellow.
[197:22.01]Purple and yellow.
[197:24.49]Are his feet orange?
[197:25.11]I don't think so.
[197:35.72]Alright.
[197:39.80]Very cool.
[197:40.48]Let's do color.
[197:49.42]This purple.
[197:54.18]Alright, nice.
[197:55.48]That's Spiral of the Dragon.
[197:58.49]Well, it's got to be a little lighter.
[198:03.17]There it is!
[198:11.87]There it is.
[198:12.97]Okay, what else can we do?
[198:15.23]This is Pattern.
[198:38.26]This is my favorite part.
[198:40.36]You can choose the pet's colors and patterns, and they will appear on whichever skin type you just picked.
[198:46.15]It's just smooth, right?
[198:48.33]Did that do anything?
[199:08.67]That's good.
[199:13.39]Oh, yes.
[199:14.49]Very stylish.
[199:16.13]Alright, color.
[199:16.79]This is where we get it.
[199:17.61]It's orange, right?
[199:18.25]No, that's correct.
[199:24.88]Eyes.
[199:25.10]What does Fire have for eyes?
[199:26.52]Okay, this is where you specify the pet's eyes.
[199:29.70]Right.
[199:29.88]Do you want them to be adorable or intense?
[199:33.02]Awesome or just plain strange?

[200:53.46]Build.
[201:04.69]This is where you choose your pet's build.
[201:07.19]Is it sleep or stalking?
[201:14.48]How many can I do?
[201:25.10]I think that's as big as I can make Spiral.
[201:33.47]Alright, and now Fantastic Pet.
[201:41.39]What on Earth?

[202:23.90]Copy what you see Avatar doing and your pet will do something cool.

[202:36.93]That's really cool.
[202:37.98]You can listen to the emails you've received again later by using the smartphone.
[202:43.36]My systems include a camera so I can take photographs of any special moments and save them for until you decide to delete them.
[202:52.70]You can swap between your pets using the smartphone.
[202:56.79]This is a display of every award you've earned during the game.
[203:01.43]Why not check out the encyclopedia?

[203:26.18]This is what you'll see when a pet wants something.
[203:29.48]Just select that thought.
[203:30.48]She just crossed her eyes.

[206:04.67]Don't forget that a second player can join in the game and you can play with your pet together.
[206:10.62]When two of you are playing, you can both have fun with the pet.
[206:14.44]Plus, some of the play activities support two players, so try them out.
[206:21.93]Hi, this is Jerma985, and you're watching Jerma985 on the Disney Channel.
[206:25.49]Try all sorts of different gestures and see which one your pet responds to.
[206:30.15]I lost my powers.
[206:39.66]Okay, time for your first talent show, I think.
[206:44.00]What's a talent show?
[206:45.96]Well, trainers headquarters doesn't just find and look after their fantastic pets.

[207:15.39]Mom is back here too!
[207:33.22]Can't get close, guys.
[207:52.33]The points that you earn in talent shows are added to your trainer rank, so they're absolutely still worth entering, even if you don't win.
[208:00.22]Don't worry if you don't do so well in an event.
[208:03.04]You can always practice some more, so you can do better next time.
[208:07.26]Remember, talent shows are about having fun with your pet.

[208:40.32]Play with bubbles by popping and swirling them around.
[208:45.45]Five, four, three, two, one.
[208:50.49]Go!
[208:53.12]The faster you move around, the more bubbles the Bubble Bubbler creates.
[209:00.40]That's good!
[209:06.45]You're improving!
[209:13.01]The faster you move around, the more bubbles the Bubble Bubbler creates.

[210:02.28]Ball fetch.
[210:18.40]Right.
[210:19.18]Time to give your pets some exercise with a game of ball fetch.
[210:23.38]No, but this one sucks.
[210:30.50]Try throwing the ball into the screen.
[210:35.70]The markers on the floor display how far your last throw and your longest throw went before the ball bounced.
[210:41.64]Whoa, you're getting a little too close.
[210:44.48]Try taking a step back.
[211:03.56]Ooh, great throw!
[211:15.73]Good throw!
[211:16.51]That's just kind of what happens when you play Fetch or the Dog for long enough and they're still so enthusiastic about it, but you aren't after the fiftieth time.
[211:32.75]It looks like your pet is enjoying this.
[211:35.97]You're like, ah, I'm kind of done.

[218:24.81]I think it's time to stick around for another 20 minutes.
[218:51.50]When you see an X mark like this on the floor, your pet can dig up a bonus gem.
[218:56.86]All you need to do is point at the X mark, or stand on it, or touch it with your hand.
[219:02.69]Dig in my floor?
[219:03.81]What are you talking about?
[219:10.19]Try all sorts of different gestures and see which one your pet responds to.
[219:21.98]Don't dig that up.
[219:22.52]Don't forget that the gems you're collecting can be used to unlock new activities in the toy box.
[219:27.50]Dig.

[224:45.55]I think I'd want to give that like, ah, I don't know.
[225:07.10]That doesn't sound good.
[225:18.02]Uh, I think it's alright.
[225:20.82]Hey, if it shuts us off, it shuts us off.
[225:22.72]We're not done.
[225:24.64]Price is right.
[225:25.48]Connect.
[225:54.51]Where's the connect?
[226:03.18]Connect party!
[226:08.46]You'll have to exit the game if you don't have a sensor.
[226:11.44]What do you mean the connect party game?
[226:29.50]Let's go.
[226:32.40]What do you mean party?

[281:10.24]RVs with a motor home thing, the trailer thing, is probably $2,000.
[281:17.16]$1,500.
[281:17.48]I'm thinking $20,000.
[281:18.42]And then the carpet is probably $500.
[281:20.96]I'm thinking $2,800.
[281:21.50]$3,000.
[281:21.52]$2,100. $2,400.
[281:35.82]No, it's probably more $30, $30, $30, $100.
[281:36.40]$30, $100 bucks.
[281:36.76]$30, $100.
[281:36.92]That's it.
[281:37.38]Oh, boy.
[281:37.52]Wait.
[281:37.72]Did I lose?
[281:37.98]Did I lose?
[282:05.10]Your opponent's bid is closest.
[282:07.02]You don't win anything.
[282:21.48]I'm gonna I'm gonna fall.
[282:26.38]I don't know why I did this.
[282:28.96]I have nothing to support me right now.
[282:30.76]I'm gonna fall down.
[282:36.98]I'm wearing socks.
[282:38.32]You don't do this in socks.
[282:43.58]And you don I couldn't stand up.
[282:51.41]There's no way.
[282:51.93]It's possible.
[282:57.89]You did your best.
[282:58.45]I did do my best.
[283:00.09]It's time to do something else.
[283:02.45]So... I've probably got...
[283:07.43]It's just about five hours.
[283:12.97]Let's go for... This is a fan fan favorite.
[283:19.07]If I'm gonna do like one, maybe two more, this is the fan favorite one we gotta do right now.
[283:29.62]It is not Family Feud.
[283:50.14]Kung Fu High Impact.
[283:51.26]Remember this?
[284:06.36]Star Wars?
[284:06.76]Yeah, I did Star for like an hour and a half earlier.
[284:12.93]Here we go.
[284:13.25]There's so many more over here.
[284:20.74]But I don't want to just blow through, because there's a lot of good stuff over here.
[284:25.96]There's a lot of good stuff in here.
[284:27.09]A lot of good stuff that we've played already.
[284:33.81]It's time to kick some ass.
[284:42.45]They have this shit for Kinect.
[284:45.39]And it's probably way better than the one that I played.
[285:00.89]Get a bat or I got one.
[285:06.69]Save data must be created.
[285:08.03]Save it.
[285:10.45]Storage device memory unit will be used.
[285:12.53]That's fine.
[285:16.17]So I'm going to get off camera here because I'm just in the game.
[285:19.95]So why would I?
[285:20.59]There's no reason for me to be on camera.
[285:23.78]Here we go.
[285:25.72]Okay.
[285:27.20]That's not what I wanted to do.
[285:37.67]Difficulty normal is fine.
[285:40.43]There we go.
[286:05.52]Chapter One, Fears Have Forgotten.
[286:11.90]You can get lost, but the ghosts from your past may still find you and haunt you.
[286:22.44]You thought it was over, but things of that magnitude do not end easily.
[286:30.96]And stories unfinished tend to carry on when you least expect it.
[286:40.80]And so it begins.
[286:45.38]Ah, what a nice place.
[286:48.38]How did I get here?
[286:49.26]I didn't think I was supposed to be leaning.
[286:52.42]What?
[286:52.66]Who's there?
[287:04.25]I don't know, Jeremy.
[287:05.19]Who is there?
[287:07.79]You gonna do anything else?
[287:14.61]Stretch before playing to prevent aching muscles.
[287:16.60]Why didn't you tell me that like six hours ago?
[287:19.84]Oh my, that's where my whole body hurts right now.
[287:29.74]Round one.
[287:34.34]Is that me?
[287:36.20]Welcome to Kung Fu High Impact.
[287:40.31]Are you ready to kick some serious ass?
[287:43.27]Let's go through a few tricks.
[287:45.29]That's what we were doing yesterday.
[287:47.53]Enemies are to your left and right.
[287:51.18]Fight in your own style.
[287:52.04]They sure are.
[287:52.78]All moves deal damage as long as they're fast enough.
[287:59.42]Like this guy over here.
[288:02.17]Hey, how are you?
[288:07.36]Sorry about that.
[288:10.34]Why am I so tiny?
[288:12.81]I really should be taller.
[288:14.63]This is not correct.
[288:23.61]It's not correct.
[288:24.52]The Kinect is in the wrong spot.
[288:30.36]Hey guys, check this out.
[288:39.64]I'm recalibrating this.
[288:41.06]I need to be, like, fucking three feet taller.
[288:44.55]See, the Kinect doesn't even have my feet.
[288:46.41]Look it.
[288:48.03]Look it.
[288:48.65]See?
[288:48.73]Look.
[288:49.05]It's cutting me off.
[288:49.83]I don't even have shins.
[288:50.69]Look.
[288:50.81]Got him.
[289:13.27]You got it.
[289:14.31]Dodge, jump, punch, double punch.
[289:45.35]Get out of here.
[289:51.60]Where is he?
[289:52.04]Yo!
[289:53.40]Round four.
[289:54.76]I'm gonna go this way.
[289:55.80]That's so awesome.
[290:14.94]red attacks are so powerful they can't be blocked so you have to dodge block nice so I have to ju I can't dodge red
[290:48.57]I'm gonna cartwheel into a motherfucker, swear to god.
[290:49.85]That's what I do, is this.
[290:50.43]Here we go.
[290:51.75]Come here.
[291:27.62]I'm a big fan of the 1, 2, 3.
[291:29.56]Alright, I need to take... I gotta get the Kinect to fix itself.
[291:48.77]Gamer picture?
[291:49.61]Where?
[292:27.37]Chapter 2, Trouble at the Docks.
[292:32.11]I've been having the same strange dream over and over lately.
[292:36.29]I sleep in my headband.
[292:40.50]Nothing else to do at the store but read the comics.
[292:43.18]They must be messing with my head.
[292:44.64]Speaking of the store, I'm late from picking up Lady Wei's delivery.
[292:52.64]It's not such a bad job working for her.
[292:56.33]Walking in the sun, picking up strange packages.
[293:00.31]Like this one.
[293:00.99]Eh, it looks ordinary.
[293:02.91]But believe me, I've seen the strange powers these comics have.
[293:06.66]Yeah, I guess you could say working for a wizard has its own twists and turns.
[293:13.08]What the?
[293:15.96]I don't like... the sound of this.
[293:33.36]Here we go.
[293:34.52]It's time to be a fighter.
[293:39.56]Take control of the battlefield.
[293:40.40]Use power punch.
[293:41.44]The faster you move from side to side, the more distance you cover in the game.
[293:43.68]Kicks and punches also move you forward.
[293:45.44]Use somersaults to reach higher platforms or escape danger.
[293:58.01]You can even surprise your enemies from behind.
[294:00.21]How do I do that?
[294:01.97]All at once, jump, throw your hands up, and bend.
[294:04.87]I need legs.
[294:11.40]Why don't you come up here and say that to me?
[294:35.09]Oh, I gotta go this way.
[294:35.87]Power-ups!
[294:58.86]Where's their- is somebody- OOH!
[295:05.92]why did it not work I just stomped him alright my headphones came out pouring out use power punch to slam the doors shut
[295:36.69]I gotta block.
[295:44.27]I gotta remember to block.
[295:48.52]Power Punch shot the Taurus.
[296:01.80]I just taunted when I wasn't supposed to.
[296:03.56]You can't taunt.
[296:24.71]Almost, I'm almost dead.
[296:25.85]Check this boom-bop.
[296:29.13]Oh, wait.
[296:29.43]I'm trying to close the door.
[296:30.48]Alright, I got it.
[296:31.86]Door closed.
[296:32.34]Ain't getting out of that one.
[296:57.14]Where are they coming from?
[297:00.95]Has it begun praying?
[297:35.96]Ah!
[298:14.05]Come on, don't be a light out yet.
[298:15.57]Hey!
[298:17.37]Close the door.
[298:51.59]One, two, three.
[299:01.56]To a backflip.
[299:24.85]Do a backflip!
[299:31.13]Jesus!
[299:32.79]Ow!
[299:33.29]Ow!
[299:33.65]Ow!
[299:51.64]Ow!
[299:52.26]Oh, I gotta close that.
[299:55.64]Power punch!
[299:59.43]Power punch!
[300:00.95]Power punch!
[300:20.66]Close this fucking door.
[300:26.46]Oh god, it's so good.
[300:28.70]See ya.
[300:30.60]The Irish tangent, Chippy.
[301:11.58]You!
[301:13.04]Slow jump!
[301:25.13]No!
[301:55.27]Close it!
[301:57.05]Up!
[302:00.91]Other way!
[302:29.09]Backwards.
[302:30.73]Back.
[302:32.87]Forward.
[302:40.00]Get up there.
[302:44.70]Ooh, I just got rid of him.
[303:34.67]Oh, my God.
[303:36.45]Oh, God.
[304:04.52]Don't do it!
[304:05.34]I'm fine.
[304:39.72]Go drink some water?
[304:41.48]What?
[305:06.16]Chapter three, break loose.
[305:12.45]It worked.
[305:12.91]Stay down.
[305:16.37]Whoa.
[305:16.52]It was like a Halloween party gone seriously wrong.
[305:22.98]More?
[305:24.30]Thanks, guys, but I have to skip the party and get back to work.
[305:33.92]The same freaks.
[305:36.37]Hey, I worked there.
[305:37.91]Cut it out.
[306:10.35]Bonus items.
[306:12.05]These mystic stones contain health or special powers.
[306:16.56]Smash them to get to the goodies inside.
[306:25.92]Great.
[306:26.60]Excuse you.
[306:31.66]Goodies?
[306:35.04]Where are they?
[306:35.50]In here?
[306:50.40]I'm the best still!
[307:06.12]Double uppercut.
[307:07.42]I'm gonna utilize the uppercut more often.
[307:43.81]Adopted?
[307:44.27]Nice!
[307:46.45]Back to sneak into the alley?
[307:55.18]What happens if I make myself like just tiny?
[307:57.82]And they like not touch me?
[308:28.76]Aw, come on, I had it.
[308:31.99]This tank is empty!
[308:33.75]I already most-
[309:00.67]I'm out of gas.
[309:02.45]I have to... Oh!
[309:47.26]Where's their health?
[309:48.21]Did I get it?
[309:51.83]Who the fuck is that?
[310:18.83]Wait!
[310:19.83]Let's talk about this.
[310:22.23]You don't know?
[310:25.14]Uncall for.
[310:27.56]What?! !
[311:03.65]bonus items.
[311:05.37]These mystic stones contain health or special powers.
[311:09.85]Smash them to get to the goodies inside.
[311:16.11]Thanks for coming to the stream.
[311:17.19]I'll see you guys.
[311:19.45]We're going to play Ancestors in a couple days.
[311:23.72]Get off me.
[311:26.74]I'm trying to talk.
[311:27.42]I'm trying to do my outro.
[311:42.70]oh no it's a child temper tantrum it's working energy rekindled
[312:11.20]You guys have seen, um... You guys have seen, uh, Kingpin.
[312:18.56]When Big Erd McCracken is bowling his ass off, his, like, wig is just all over the place.
[312:53.53]I gotta get this boss.
[313:13.36]I'm really fighting.
[313:14.48]Okay, time for a weapon.
[313:35.73]It's not helping!
[313:36.79]It's too heavy!
[313:41.77]Wait!
[313:42.23]Get the obelisk!
[314:06.93]They can't hit what they can't see!
[314:55.23]You know that guy you see in the gym sometimes that's there for three and a half hours?
[314:59.31]And he's like, literally water's coming down from his body?
[315:03.13]Add two and a half hours onto that guy.
[315:05.53]I am stronger than the fucking huge guy in the gym that does cardio for three and a half hours.
[315:11.71]I'm stronger than that guy.
[315:20.38]Hold on, where's my button?
[315:31.77]I tried to make the mushroom sound He just ate Toad
[316:01.96]Hey!
[316:36.12]Why is that somehow worse?
[316:37.30]I heard a crack!
[316:58.10]Aim the camera down or push it back so you can get your legs in.
[317:05.59]The Kinect has like a mind of its own.
[317:12.90]I'm doing better.
[317:15.88]Do you have to be strong to play this?
[317:25.53]Yeah.
[317:28.25]Strong enough.
[317:39.74]That's a good technique, the fucking like octopus hands.
[317:42.03]Or like the directing symphony, whichever one you want to call it.
[318:15.16]What?
[318:16.20]Oh.
[318:16.38]Get out of here, I just kicked his ass.
[318:49.15]Pee Pee Poo Poo
[319:31.53]Chapter four, Helmet Blunder.
[319:37.92]Who are these guys?
[319:40.52]They sure don't look like your ordinary comic book fans.
[319:44.46]Okay, let's figure this out.
[319:46.80]Hmm, Lady Wei warned me about something before she left.
[319:49.77]Here's a list of tasks for you to do.
[319:53.19]Be sure you do everything on the list.
[319:54.91]I feel like I shouldn't even be in this scene.
[319:56.75]Especially the last one.
[319:59.87]Let's see.
[320:00.61]I'm pretty sure I did everything.
[320:03.91]Save the world.
[320:05.05]Check.
[320:05.71]Clean up.
[320:06.49]Check.
[320:07.19]Destroy Kwong's helmet.
[320:09.69]Destroy Kwong's helmet!
[320:12.21]Oh, crap.
[320:13.01]It's still in the basement.
[320:14.15]Maybe it's just a coincidence.
[320:17.63]Those guys might have nothing to do with the helmet.
[320:20.61]What was that?
[320:22.53]Doesn't look like much.
[320:25.82]Well, let's get the job done.
[320:30.45]Krong?
[320:30.99]I'm assuming this is a boss fight.
[320:48.84]Alright, I can take- I can get- I can beat this boss.
[321:00.62]I have faith.
[321:15.29]Backing up?
[321:16.79]Don't matter.
[321:18.65]Stay down.
[321:26.96]I'm not gonna take a fucking hit.
[321:32.26]Except for that one, that's the only one you get!
[322:16.55]Sidekick, bingo.
[322:17.79]Full health, we're good.
[322:54.01]Oh, I just got comboed.
[323:12.66]The bouncing ball technique is pretty good.
[323:16.20]Checkpoint.
[323:20.76]New power, ground shaker.
[323:24.59]Ground shaker may not do much damage, but it throws your enemies off.
[323:28.79]It can also damage particularly sturdy enemies.
[323:33.29]Jump up and slam your hand to the ground as you land.
[323:42.92]Jump up and slam your hand to the ground as you land.
[323:55.39]That move don't work.
[323:56.43]Jump up and slam your hand to the ground as you land.
[323:59.25]Time to get hurt.
[324:07.04]Oh, shit.
[324:32.37]Stupid idiot!
[324:33.39]Stupid idiot!
[324:34.09]Mom's gonna kill you when she finds out that you took my car!
[324:39.65]Are you gonna fight me or what?
[324:48.74]Make it easy on yourself.
[325:17.02]Ow, that's gonna hurt.
[325:25.14]I'll beat you like last night's meat.
[326:16.60]I destroyed him!
[326:22.56]I bet you think Rob Schneider is funny.
[326:26.31]Yeah, I do.
[326:30.63]That's a pretty good bet.
[326:44.66]I can do this one.
[327:24.80]Chapter 5, Eye of the Dragon.
[327:30.66]Oh man, he scared the crap out of me.
[327:35.79]I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[327:38.23]It seems to make him stronger.
[327:42.81]I wonder if... Whatever you do, do not put the helmet on.
[327:49.21]The darkness will transform you.
[327:52.71]Just a thought.
[327:53.83]To be honest with you, rust brown isn't really my color.
[327:56.25]I'll just bin it.
[328:00.72]I'll smash it and bury the pieces.
[328:04.42]Gonna become the Lich King.
[328:06.14]There, sorry.
[328:07.70]Nothing to it.
[328:11.32]Get out of that if you can, saucepan.
[328:13.31]A good stomp should finish it off.
[328:24.74]A portal?
[328:25.94]This is getting seriously out of hand.
[328:29.90]Not the promotion in that one.
[328:31.38]Could have done better than that.
[328:42.97]Ow, ouch.
[328:47.49]Ow, that hurts.
[328:55.77]I feel like I've been in that position like three or four times today.
[329:01.25]My body is emanating heat.
[329:02.69]We're gonna have to go with a new strategy.
[329:22.61]Probably lost five pounds today.
[329:24.55]No.
[329:26.60]I need a new Sprat.
[330:01.70]Much easier.
[330:15.95]What do you got?
[330:16.51]Well, I should have been doing this from the beginning.
[330:31.08]It's permanent Liu Kang.
[330:32.50]I unlocked the secret.
[331:02.59]I remember this part.
[331:05.78]Did I do the same joke last time?
[331:13.13]I think I may have.
[331:43.04]this is the best defense if you have like an older brother this is the little brother defense against the older brother I used to do it all the time you just go like this and they're gonna get you
[332:16.03]I almost just ripped my pants!
[332:25.52]Did they rip?
[332:27.34]I think I'm alright.
[332:43.90]Can you imagine if I went like this and it split right in the middle on camera?
[332:49.67]That would be really bad.
[332:53.39]Like, just... Just like, boom!
[332:57.57]Oh my god, that would be... You know, I would accept defeat at that point.
[333:17.23]You're not wearing underwear yet?
[333:18.51]Why?
[333:18.75]What are you doing?
[333:19.57]What?
[333:21.33]My pants are gonna rip in the middle and then, like, all my shit is gonna come out.
[333:48.53]Dude, I'll give it to people that can- that can- I mean obviously I've been doing this for like six hours or so, but imagine starting this shit.
[334:02.87]This game is just- you're constantly moving around.
[334:06.81]Forget about like, Zumba class.
[334:08.96]Just go get this.
[334:10.26]Go download it.
[334:11.68]It's still on the Xbox store.
[334:13.50]Go get it!
[334:14.94]You wanna work out?
[334:15.80]Go sit in the chair and put your legs up and rip your pants in half.
[334:18.23]I muffed this one.
[335:13.75]There's hair in my mouth still from like an hour and a half ago.
[335:28.00]Is the chair fighting?
[335:35.95]Come on, get him, chair!
[335:38.15]You can do it!
[335:43.57]It's like Doctor Strange!
[335:57.36]Back it up!
[335:58.60]Ahhh!
[336:11.64]He tries here.
[336:12.68]He tried.
[336:17.09]The chair was doing better than me.
[336:27.52]Shred?
[336:27.86]No, I'm definitely going to shred this game.
[336:37.72]I'm going to have to go get some water and then we're going to have to just kind of chill.
[336:45.78]This is where I tap out at six hours.
[336:50.44]I've punched the air probably six to seven thousand times.
[336:57.48]This is so fun though.
[337:05.73]This is supposed to be a 12 hour stream.
[337:09.29]No way.
[337:13.84]If I don't get in the shower in the next 40 minutes, you will see a guy pass out on stream.
[337:25.09]Why would I shred my chair?
[337:26.73]I love my chair.
[337:27.60]It's a great chair.
[337:33.80]So here's the plan.
[337:36.56]These games are really, really fun.
[337:39.74]And I spent more time in some of them than I thought.
[337:42.58]Which I knew was probably the case.
[337:49.35]There are a couple of really, really great ones still.
[337:51.59]There's like 10 that are still around.
[337:57.77]So we're going to do another, we're just going to do more Connect.
[338:00.95]We're just going to, but not now.
[338:03.81]Not this week.
[338:05.63]We're going to put it in the box until next week.
[338:07.87]Because Ancestors comes out on Tuesday.
[338:10.81]And that's what I want to do next.
[338:15.03]That Evolution Ape game, it seems really, really just ridiculous.
[338:20.71]I'm going to play that for probably a day or so.
[338:24.92]We're gonna start the next Kinect stream with Rise of Nightmares.
[338:29.94]Because that is absolutely gonna be like a two to three hour experience, at least.
[338:34.12]It's a full game.
[338:43.63]So we'll probably actually do that this coming weekend.
[338:46.51]Because, let me think about this.
[338:47.57]So Tuesday I'm gonna do Ancestors.
[338:50.47]And then...
[338:53.30]Maybe we could do, like, Thursday or Friday, maybe.
[338:55.60]Because Saturday we're doing... We're finishing Terraria on Saturday.
[339:00.19]Star and I. We're going to do the base game.
[339:01.91]We're going to complete it.
[339:09.41]So, I don't know.
[339:09.75]Maybe, like, Sunday?
[339:11.21]We'll do, like, a horror thing on Sunday.
[339:13.25]Because there's two horror games for the Kinect that I'm going to do.
[339:16.16]Haunt.
[339:17.82]And then Rise of Nightmares.
[339:20.34]They're both apparently really interesting.
[339:22.16]So...
[339:23.85]But I gotta get some water.
[339:24.67]I gotta clock out here.
[339:27.20]We'll come back.
[339:27.72]I'll hang up for a little bit.
[339:28.42]We'll do the bits.
[339:29.06]We'll talk.
[339:30.72]We'll probably be done in about six, six and a half hours or so.
[339:36.46]So I will see you guys if you've taken off.
[339:38.76]I will see you guys on Tuesday for Ancestors.
[339:44.04]That's the day it launches on PC.
[339:48.59]I'll be right back.
[339:49.19]I'm gonna get some water.
[339:51.43]BRB.
[340:18.79]Thank you.
[342:02.45]Alright.
[342:05.67]So again, if you're sticking around, I will see you on Tuesday.
[342:10.00]Today's Sunday, so I won't be streaming tomorrow.
[342:12.32]I'll see you on Tuesday.
[342:17.82]The stream was shorter than I expected.
[342:19.26]I drank a battery for no reason.
[342:20.67]Why would you ever have a battery for lunch?
[342:26.37]Don't do that.
[342:26.85]That's a bad idea.
[342:31.11]I would advise against ever doing something like that.
[342:39.18]So, let's do the bits.
[342:42.46]Last stream before school starts again for a lot of you guys.
[342:44.64]Well, good luck.
[342:46.46]You still get your weekends.
[342:48.22]Just work hard and make sure you get your schoolwork done.
[342:55.58]Did the Ancestors team say how far along the game is for the demo?
[342:59.32]Wait, it's not coming out.
[343:04.34]You don't stream on weekends.
[343:07.60]What's today?
[343:09.51]And what was yesterday?
[343:13.33]Was yesterday Thursday?
[343:15.15]What's today?
[343:16.81]Saturday and Sunday.
[343:18.09]Huh?
[343:19.27]What's happening here?
[343:24.94]What is this backpack thing?
[343:27.02]I see this backpack every day!
[343:32.53]So wait, hold on.
[343:33.37]Can somebody clarify this with me?
[343:34.87]Is Ancestors not releasing on Tuesday for PC?
[343:51.39]The one with the apes.
[343:52.39]Yeah, 2020.
[343:53.25]But that's for console, though.
[343:58.05]Because it comes out a few months after the PC release.
[344:00.69]And I think it's on the Epic Games Store.
[344:02.39]I don't think it's a Steam thing.
[344:04.89]Yeah, initial release date, August 27th, 2019.
[344:07.39]It's a demo.
[344:10.17]The Steam page says 2020.
[344:10.99]Well, I think it's because it's Epic Games Store.
[344:19.43]Alright, so I'm going to look into that because hopefully it's not just a demo on the 27th.
[344:28.73]Feeling sore or tired?
[344:29.81]Take a break.
[344:30.33]Connect to IAM.
[344:33.97]So it's a full game.
[344:34.75]Yeah, that's wet strength.
[344:35.79]That's weird.
[344:37.03]So they're releasing exclusively on the Epic Games Store for PC only on the 27th, and then a couple months later it's going to consoles, and then a month or two later after that it's going to Steam.
[344:50.34]That seems like a very odd release schedule.
[344:55.88]I don't... That's weird.
[344:58.77]But, I guess, whatever.
[345:05.17]But thank you, everybody, for watching.
[345:07.83]I, I'm gonna go, you know what I need to do?
[345:09.62]I need to take a bath.
[345:14.90]I have this, like, part in the middle of my spine right now, and you know what I think happened?
[345:18.66]It happened when I did the breakdancing move.
[345:20.88]When I did, like, in the Power Rangers game, I did the breakdancing move, and, like, I tweaked my spine.
[345:29.01]I'm fine, though.
[345:29.63]I just need to soak for like 20 minutes.
[345:36.02]Get some Epsom salts.
[345:36.96]Yeah, that's a super old person thing, but I'll do it.
[345:40.66]But let's go back to earlier today.
[345:44.56]Oh, by the way, another important thing for the community nights.
[345:47.80]The monthly community nights.
[345:51.31]We are, I just gave a huge list of things to all the mods about the channel in the Discord that's going to open up.
[346:00.99]So probably somewhere around next weekend or maybe, maybe even by the time I stream next in like a few days, there's going to be a new channel in the Discord.
[346:10.62]in that channel will be kind of like the recommended channel where you put in there a piece of artwork, a song, a video that's related to the channel somehow.
[346:21.90]I have a whole huge thing of rules that eventually will get pinned and posted somewhere in that channel.
[346:28.40]So in once a month, instead of doing this thing at the end of streams where I put on artwork or a video that somebody made, because let's face it, I said this last night, but I'll say it again just because probably a lot of people that weren't here yesterday.
[346:41.44]When the stream ends and this screen goes on, most people will just kind of leave the stream.
[346:47.41]I mean, not most, but it's usually around like 50% to 60%.
[346:52.31]We'll just kind of be like, alright, see you later.
[346:53.65]See you next time, right?
[346:54.95]So they don't get to see some of these awesome videos that we show here.
[347:03.46]So, I mean, I guess that is most.
[347:04.84]Yeah, I guess it is.
[347:07.49]And there has been so many great videos.
[347:09.33]Think about the videos.
[347:11.14]Think about the artwork that has been shown here.
[347:14.34]That a lot of people, maybe they might think it was cool or think it was interesting.
[347:18.66]So I figured we'll do like a little radio show thing where once a month we sit down for a few hours and we just go over all the cool community content that people make.
[347:27.45]In one place.
[347:28.61]At one time.
[347:29.75]And everybody knows that's what the function is.
[347:33.57]Rather than for the bits...
[347:35.75]It's, hey, it's the bits.
[347:36.78]And also, here's a really cool piece of artwork, don't you think?
[347:39.52]I think it's better that way.
[347:52.81]That's what I think.
[347:53.99]It should be interesting to do.
[347:56.17]But, uh, let's move on.
[347:57.33]I just want to make sure I clarify that that is coming probably in the next three to five days.
[348:02.65]Keep an eye on the Discord if you're not part of the Discord.
[348:05.92]Join it.
[348:06.44]It's open to the public.
[348:08.79]Anybody can be a part of it.
[348:14.71]But it's not just going to be for artwork.
[348:17.34]It will be for everything.
[348:20.46]Everything.
[348:22.48]That is related.
[348:23.54]Like, one of the things I put in a pin, or that I put in the post that I made to the mods was... I mean, if you put, like, Gordon Ramsay saying fuck off ten times in a compilation, that is not, like, a community piece of content.
[348:37.68]It's just Gordon Ramsay saying fuck off, like, ten times.
[348:41.34]If it's somehow related to a game, or a stream, or a thing, or a joke, you know, something like that.
[348:54.40]That's very specific.
[348:55.56]But I'm just saying, like, I don't want you to link in that Discord, like, your favorite YouTube video.
[349:03.86]That's not the purpose of these nights.
[349:05.34]Because it's only going to be probably two or three hours.
[349:07.88]And I want to keep that reserved for, like, community content.
[349:15.71]I mean, if you edit me into a Gordon Ramsay fucking taste test where he tells me to fuck off, there you go.
[349:23.12]What a narcissist I am.
[349:25.06]I have to be in it.
[349:31.67]But thank you.
[349:32.79]Thank you to Chris Buck 365 for the four dolls.
[349:36.71]Thank you.
[349:37.01]Appreciate it.
[349:39.31]Gnarly thanks to the 250.
[349:40.27]Have you ever considered revisiting games you played on a main channel video for a stream?
[349:43.85]Games like Raven's Cry, Total Distortion, or I Am Alive.
[349:47.78]Maybe as a compilation like these Kinect games would be fun.
[349:52.90]Total Distortion I think would be really cool.
[349:55.08]Total Distortion is hard to get to run and to capture though.
[349:59.88]All those old games are so difficult because they're barely even DirectX.
[350:05.01]You have to capture a whole monitor.
[350:06.53]The thing's in like 480 by fucking 160.
[350:10.85]It's hell to get those to capture through a capture device.
[350:19.57]Oh, there's no music.
[350:20.73]Sorry.
[350:26.76]They're tiny, weird resolutions.
[350:30.27]I think total distortion is actually Flash.
[350:33.43]Or Adobe Director or something.
[350:35.41]It's not even a 3D engine.
[350:41.01]I've used a virtual machine before.
[350:43.94]But I'd have to really set that up.
[350:47.32]I think I've actually used a virtual machine for recording and video streaming purposes.
[350:53.18]I believe I did.
[350:53.82]Windows 95, 98...
[351:01.29]Just point your webcam at it.
[351:02.49]Yeah, I could do that too.
[351:04.37]But yes, I have thought about it before.
[351:12.28]I mean, the Super Mario RPG is gonna be done next week.
[351:21.03]$50 came in 10 minutes ago.
[351:22.71]I was not here for it.
[351:24.63]But thank you Killer Crocomire for the 5,000 bits.
[351:29.76]We all know Sam and Max is coming back.
[351:32.22]Right, chat?
[351:35.84]Yeah.
[351:38.50]Yeah, I played the first episode and then a lot of people started to lose interest.
[351:43.12]I kind of started to lose interest too.
[351:45.38]Something about that third season, the first episode didn't pull me like the first two seasons did.
[351:51.75]I'm still going to finish it.
[351:53.15]Because I'm not going to start episode one on the final season and not do it.
[351:58.03]But it didn't grab me like the other two seasons did.
[352:01.96]Something about it.
[352:03.10]I don't know what it was.
[352:09.08]But thank you, Killer Crocomire, for the 50 bucks, 5,000 bits.
[352:14.78]You'll see it again.
[352:18.75]Maybe next week we'll just be... We'll do Sam & Max, Super Mario RPG, and more Kinect.
[352:24.23]It makes sense, I think.
[352:32.57]But yeah.
[352:37.57]Thank you to Elizabeth for the $2.50.
[352:42.14]In honor of playing Star Wars on stream, I'm bringing back this classic.
[352:45.38]Is this the Han Solo song?
[352:52.92]Han Solo?
[352:54.92]I five-starred that on Expert.
[352:56.45]Were you here for that?
[353:01.57]Jeremy is a Jedi Master?
[353:02.99]What the hell is this?
[353:04.71]Why can I not hear it?
[353:07.35]Oh, it's because this is pulled up.
[353:13.21]This classic.
[353:14.04]What is it?
[353:14.46]This classic.
[353:25.20]Now let's see if we can't figure out what you are.
[353:27.06]I thought this was a Han Solo song.
[353:28.98]And where you come from.
[353:32.83]Oh, it's the hologram video.
[353:35.82]Oh, okay.
[353:38.54]This is from one of the green screen nights.
[353:49.69]That is a classic, you're right.
[354:01.50]That thumbnail.
[354:02.64]What is that?
[354:03.16]Shrek?
[354:03.30]What is that thumbnail?
[354:04.86]What does that have to do with the video?
[354:09.99]I saw it for two seconds.
[354:10.91]Is that the Green Goblin?
[354:28.96]Shrek?
[354:29.26]I don't know.
[354:29.60]Who is that?
[354:31.75]Purple underwear?
[354:34.89]Why am I looking at that for so long?
[354:37.33]Alright.
[354:38.81]It's the Hulk!
[354:39.47]The Hulk!
[354:39.95]The Hulk!
[354:40.51]Okay, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[354:45.30]The green goblin runs around in purple underwear.
[354:51.66]I'm tired.
[354:52.40]I'm sorry.
[355:04.08]I need to put this on screen.
[355:05.80]This is spot the difference This is from C4G is what I have to put this on Thank You C4G for the 250
[355:33.38]Thank you.
[355:34.98]I don't see any difference.
[355:37.83]You're welcome.
[355:38.49]Absolutely.
[355:38.71]I'm... trying to pull the streams back an hour or two.
[355:40.07]Slowly, over time, trying to stick to that.
[356:01.64]So you'll be seeing earlier streams in the future as well.
[356:06.90]Thank you, Elizabeth, for the 250.
[356:08.02]I will electrocute you is my favorite quote from the Emperor, by the way.
[356:13.95]Oh, we're talking about grabbing his throat, right?
[356:19.05]Oh, yeah.
[356:20.15]I had a lot of shit to say about Star Wars today, didn't I?
[356:27.60]Chunky Baloney gave $50 and 20 subs earlier.
[356:30.91]Thank you.
[356:31.65]That is a lot.
[356:33.63]That's a shitload of money.
[356:37.49]Bitslave also gave a ton of subs and $50.45.
[356:46.95]Thank you.
[356:48.49]And they say, hey Jerma, not sure if you remember me, but I used to watch your streams all the time and donate like 25 cents all the time.
[356:53.87]I have not a lot of free time to watch your streams anymore, but I do keep up with the vods.
[356:58.11]Thanks for all the great content over the years.
[356:59.69]P.S.
[356:59.95]Do you still have that picture of my dad and I on your computer?
[357:03.91]I do not.
[357:04.97]I do not because I have formatted my hard drive since then.
[357:10.83]They're talking about this plane, right?
[357:14.32]I do remember this.
[357:15.02]Yep, it's airplane.
[357:16.46]You and dad in front of the airplane.
[357:20.20]I do remember that.
[357:22.48]So yes, I remember you.
[357:29.36]But yeah, thanks for coming back.
[357:31.56]I hope you're doing well.
[357:35.98]Thanks for the huge amount of subs that you dropped.
[357:38.40]And thanks for the $50.45.
[357:42.72]Appreciate it.
[357:44.96]And then they gave five more dollars.
[357:46.26]They said five dollars more for the next Bit Badge.
[357:49.25]There you go.
[357:52.85]Thank you, Bit Slave.
[357:54.01]Welcome back.
[357:56.91]Let's get the credits on.
[357:58.19]Here they come.
[358:04.49]These are all the subs.
[358:06.79]All the new, old, resubs, community subs, everybody.
[358:12.15]I think.
[358:13.55]They should be showing up very shortly.
[358:15.51]They're there.
[358:18.44]Thank you all of you again.
[358:24.40]All 16,500 of you.
[358:28.00]Just kidding.
[358:28.48]I don't have that many subs.
[358:31.94]But man, it feels like it sometimes.
[358:34.50]Thank you guys.
[358:35.20]For real.
[358:44.77]Really appreciate it.
[358:51.09]Thank you, Master Chicken, for the $5.
[358:52.39]Probably going to get tired.
[358:53.81]Probably going to get fired from work because of my prescription medication.
[358:58.10]Coming home, being able to watch this stream is making my day more bearable.
[359:03.98]I'm not sure what you mean by that, but I'm really sorry to hear that.
[359:08.31]That sucks.
[359:09.19]That's not cool.
[359:17.46]Hopefully you get that sorted out.
[359:24.04]I'd probably figure out if that's, you know, you got rights as a worker, you know.
[359:35.27]But hopefully you can figure out whatever's going on there.
[359:37.50]I'm really sorry to hear that you're having trouble there.
[359:44.19]But thanks for sticking around here.
[359:45.81]Thanks for watching.
[359:46.73]Thanks for the $5.
[359:47.41]Appreciate it.
[359:55.40]Yeah, good luck.
[359:56.24]Best of luck to you.
[360:02.38]Thank you, Bitslay, for the $5.
[360:03.42]They say, look at this burger I got from McDonald's.
[360:08.38]What are you doing?
[360:09.98]What?
[360:10.40]Oh, that looks disgusting.
[360:13.82]Why did you... Why did you do... Are you watching this in, like, a Facebook browser?
[360:20.59]This is freaking me out.
[360:24.45]This is freaking me out.
[360:25.57]Why did you give me this?
[360:35.31]Is that a burger?
[360:38.75]Hold on.
[360:44.28]What the hell is this?
[360:49.50]You got that from McDonald's.
[360:51.26]Why are you giving this to me?
[360:57.29]That looks like a puppet.
[360:58.97]It looks like a mouth and a mustache.
[361:01.41]That looks like the Pringles guy without his eyes.
[361:04.67]What did you do to the Pringles guy?
[361:25.59]Yeah, I'd still eat that, too.
[361:26.89]That actually looks kind of good.
[361:28.79]Except for that, like, weird booger that's on the left of it, whatever that is.
[361:31.41]Like, a piece of, like, onion.
[361:33.93]Well, thank you.
[361:34.49]Thank you for that.
[361:39.92]Wasn't that B on your tier list?
[361:41.60]No, it wasn't.
[361:43.48]No way, that was not B. McDonald's was not B. It was like a C-.
[361:53.96]But thank you for that.
[361:55.24]Pitsley, appreciate it.
[361:57.96]Thanks for the burger.
[361:58.92]Silent Serenity, thanks for the $2.50.
[362:00.48]Psychopath Stream alters the DNA of his dog in his garage.
[362:06.16]Well, it was a lizard.
[362:08.28]But I do get the point.
[362:09.90]Thank you for the $2.50.
[362:12.56]Thank you, Errorless, for the $2.50.
[362:13.76]You should dastardly make a Jerma plus 2 emote and only a Jerma plus 2 emote.
[362:18.48]Not a minus 2.
[362:21.32]That's not a bad idea.
[362:23.71]You could really game the system there.
[362:28.20]I don't even like Taco Bell thanks to the $2.50.
[362:31.30]Germany looked like the overenthusiastic instructor at a rock climbing summer camp.
[362:48.37]Yeah, okay.
[362:49.27]Yeah, I'll take that one.
[362:50.79]Thank you, s10wupdate for the 250.
[362:52.95]Hey, Jerma, what to say?
[362:53.55]I'm happy to support you.
[362:54.95]Unfortunately, I live in Canada, and I have to pay double for bits.
[362:59.20]500 bits is $10.
[362:59.84]That sounds ridiculous.
[363:03.78]So I can't do this often, but I want to let you know that I'll support you no matter what the cost.
[363:06.78]Peace and love.
[363:07.96]Also, congrats on being the number one Kinect streamer.
[363:10.69]Happy to hear that this is what you'll be known for.
[363:16.01]I was also the number one House Flipper streamer.
[363:17.75]Number one labo streamer.
[363:20.91]Number one birdhouse streamer.
[363:23.19]I have quite a few accolades.
[363:25.37]So.
[363:34.45]I'll take it.
[363:37.71]Thank you though.
[363:38.23]And don't worry about ever paying money.
[363:40.21]If you get destroyed on currency change there.
[363:47.53]You hanging out and watching is way more important.
[363:49.83]So, thank you, though.
[363:50.69]I appreciate it.
[363:53.71]Very good.
[363:55.35]Thanks for the... I wasn't supposed to read this one.
[363:59.65]This one's... No, this one's below the threshold.
[364:02.39]What am I doing reading it?
[364:03.39]They actually say whoever reads this is cute.
[364:10.65]So, hey.
[364:15.01]I did.
[364:16.61]It's time for Slime.
[364:17.25]Thanks for the $3.
[364:18.03]Community nights is a nice idea.
[364:19.27]I'm excited for it.
[364:22.17]It'll be a lot like this.
[364:24.13]Without the stream over screen.
[364:26.04]Probably on face cam.
[364:28.46]Hanging out.
[364:30.44]Just chilling.
[364:31.28]Going over stuff.
[364:38.07]More concentrated.
[364:42.30]When is it going to be?
[364:44.59]The channel for submissions will be up in the Discord probably this coming weekend.
[364:50.93]So, like, next weekend.
[364:52.09]Next, like, Saturday or Sunday.
[364:54.41]And then after that, probably maybe get a week of submissions.
[364:57.65]I still also have to talk about the activity book stream, which I'm going to do before I play Ancestors on Tuesday.
[365:05.77]That's the plan.
[365:08.46]We also have a 250 from Jay Bong.
[365:12.42]Hey, Jay.
[365:12.72]I haven't been able to catch a stream in over two months because I was visiting family in Vietnam.
[365:17.68]Glad to be back.
[365:18.59]Also, has Kim ever taught you any Vietnamese?
[365:21.91]Welcome back.
[365:24.75]Thanks for the 250.
[365:26.37]And yes, I have been... She's tried.
[365:30.17]I'm a very slow learner.
[365:33.70]I know how to say... I think I'm gonna try.
[365:34.94]I'm gonna say this.
[365:35.97]I don't know what I'm... I think... I believe that means I... Something... Doesn't that mean... What does that mean?
[365:51.68]That means like I'm your friend or I'm your brother, father?
[365:59.01]What did I just say?
[366:02.58]I am your, like, brother or something.
[366:05.52]Are you okay, dear?
[366:07.01]Right?
[366:08.55]No, I just asked, how are you?
[366:10.11]That's what I said.
[366:11.31]I said, how are you?
[366:12.37]Like, are you okay?
[366:13.09]How are you doing?
[366:17.21]I am your father.
[366:20.09]How are you?
[366:21.31]Wow, how wildly different that was.
[366:24.09]At least I said it.
[366:31.60]Are you alright?
[366:32.44]I am your father.
[366:33.92]I played too much Star Wars today.
[366:36.50]That's the problem.
[366:40.84]But, yes, we have... She's tried to teach me a few things.
[366:51.25]Thank you, dsoidkajpdfja.
[366:56.27]Thanks for the four dollars.
[366:57.13]Thanks for the stream, Jerma.
[366:58.09]Thanks for the four dollars.
[366:58.95]Thanks for watching.
[367:01.23]You rock.
[367:02.71]Thank you for $4.
[367:04.80]At the very end, we had $2.50 from Future Gamer.
[367:09.08]Been watching since middle school.
[367:10.38]Now I'm starting college.
[367:11.84]Any tips for college?
[367:15.40]Good luck at college.
[367:16.20]Thanks for the $2.50.
[367:17.32]And yeah, I do.
[367:20.87]If you can... I mean, this is just from my personal experience.
[367:26.33]You can take day classes or night classes.
[367:30.56]I'm not sure if you signed up for classes already.
[367:34.84]But in the future, I always did so much better on night classes.
[367:40.35]You had your whole day already signed up.
[367:42.35]Alright, well, for the next semester, it depends if you're a morning person.
[367:45.23]That's good.
[367:46.99]But for me, night classes gave me the whole day.
[367:51.13]I could sleep in, I wasn't rushing in the morning, and I could get up, take a shower, get some food, and was able to go to class later.
[367:58.83]That was really, really helpful for me.
[368:00.96]For Marie.
[368:01.64]For me.
[368:03.48]But, in regards to just general advice, um, yeah.
[368:08.62]Take it easy.
[368:12.44]You don't gotta be the best.
[368:17.34]Do your best.
[368:18.94]Fuck.
[368:19.42]I just said the same thing opposite.
[368:21.46]Listen.
[368:22.74]Okay.
[368:27.50]You don't have to be the best.
[368:30.32]Just do what you can as well as you know how.
[368:34.88]Alright.
[368:40.72]Slam fucking beer and scream.
[368:44.44]Don't do that either.
[368:56.38]You'll do the best in college.
[368:57.88]You know what?
[368:58.44]You know what I'll tell you?
[368:59.34]The real advice for college, the real advice, it's not get a 4.0.
[369:05.25]It's try to make some friends.
[369:07.75]Because everybody's starting at the same point.
[369:11.12]And as much as you don't think so, everybody else is thinking the same thing that you are.
[369:19.01]This is new.
[369:20.61]It's a little nerve-wracking.
[369:23.01]And making friends is actually a little bit easier in college because everyone is on that same playing field.
[369:31.52]You start over, essentially, in college.
[369:37.06]And find people that share the same interest as you and try to make some friends.
[369:40.82]It makes things a lot easier, a lot more smooth.
[369:54.69]High school is more clicky, but college is easier to find people with similar interests.
[369:58.68]Absolutely, because for the most part, if you're in a major, let's say you're majoring in... Let's say you're majoring in engineering or something, right?
[370:06.24]You're like, I'm studying communications.
[370:08.73]I'm learning how to do film, TV, radio.
[370:11.95]The people in your classes also think that stuff is cool.
[370:14.47]That's why they're there.
[370:16.99]I want to be a business student.
[370:18.15]I want to be a... I want to be a teacher.
[370:21.80]If you want to be a teacher, all the people in your classes all want to be teachers.
[370:27.47]You have something in common already.
[370:36.42]You went to college 10 years ago or something.
[370:38.48]Yeah.
[370:39.80]It's been a very long time.
[370:48.77]Did you learn anything from communications related to streaming?
[370:51.47]No.
[370:52.57]It was not a thing.
[370:54.63]Live broadcasted video from a computer was not something that we were doing.
[371:00.19]We were still using tapes.
[371:07.80]But I wish you the best of luck.
[371:08.92]Just take it easy.
[371:09.76]Take it slow.
[371:18.23]And good luck.
[371:20.95]Everybody's there doing the same thing.
[371:24.99]And with that.
[371:27.43]I. Will.
[371:29.25]See.
[371:30.49]You.
[371:31.93]Tuesday.
[371:33.73]For Ancestors.
[371:36.55]The Evolution Game.
[371:41.49]See you real soon.
[371:42.15]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[371:46.49]See you guys Tuesday.
[371:49.13]Probably going to start Tuesday at the normal time.
[371:51.91]So don't plan on a 12 to 1 p.m.
[371:55.03]start.
[371:56.09]Somewhere around 3 or 4.
[371:59.29]Goodbye.
[372:01.69]Take care.
[372:02.19]Have a good rest of your night.
[372:08.40]Bye.
[372:22.30]And for those of you that thought that was a little too creepy, goodbye.
[372:25.29]Have a great day.
[372:26.59]See?
[372:27.21]I can do both.
