[00:53.95]That ain't right.
[00:55.37]That ain't right.
[00:55.99]Hold on.
[00:59.07]That's right now.
[01:01.17]That's right now.
[01:22.82]Hitman again?
[01:23.99]No.
[01:25.41]Playing sorcery tonight.
[01:27.42]Sorcery.
[01:28.20]Hmm.
[01:38.16]Can't wait for more GTA.
[01:40.84]What are you talking about?
[01:55.98]I'm gonna, like, cough up a hairball in a second here, guys.
[02:06.24]It's gonna happen.
[02:09.34]You know after you're sick for, like, a week?
[02:11.32]Wait, what?
[02:13.44]After you're sick for a week, you have this thing where it doesn't matter.
[02:16.74]Like, three months go by and you're still, like...
[02:22.64]Wait, what?
[02:24.90]Wait, what?
[02:31.81]Butt cam?
[02:32.37]I'm not going to do a butt cam.
[02:37.87]In what circumstance would I ever put on a butt cam?
[02:43.53]Unless I sat in something and I wanted you to see it.
[02:56.77]Hold on a second.
[03:03.98]I love these crickets.
[03:04.74]These crickets are amazing.
[03:13.60]Okey-dokey.
[03:14.09]Let me make sure I have this capped correctly.
[03:17.59]Hi!
[03:18.15]Look at that.
[03:20.53]There's a video game here.

[03:46.53]Hello, friend.
[03:50.71]And then Delzon Mora.
[03:54.04]Delzon Mora.
[03:55.32]Thanks.
[03:55.98]Welcome.
[04:03.88]Did somebody just say, is this a flash game?
[04:06.98]How dare you insult the fucking majesty that is sorcery.
[04:10.71]Uh, no.
[04:14.49]This is not a flash game.
[04:16.15]How did I end up with two stamina?
[04:17.29]That's what I don't understand.
[04:21.39]I've spent 1,200 seconds watching advertisements to give you two dollars.
[04:28.36]Oh, gee.
[04:28.76]Well, I appreciate the dedication.
[04:36.33]Go buy a gumball.
[04:38.15]I love gumballs.
[04:40.79]Is this a Facebook game?
[04:42.41]You want to give me a shout out?
[04:44.15]Ladies and gentlemen, Roger Cheeto.
[04:46.85]Check him out on social media.
[04:48.58]At Roger Cheeto.
[04:49.92]twitch.tv/Roger Cheeto.
[04:55.04]Facebook.com slash Mike Adelson.
[05:00.08]Because that's his name.
[05:00.74]That's his real full name.
[05:07.85]You have stamina because you're shit at sorcery?
[05:10.46]How dare you?
[05:14.02]We do not talk that way about the streamer.
[05:19.30]Because when we do, when we do, bad things happen to those that say those things.
[05:29.93]Hey, Ragofrack, thanks for eight months.
[05:32.09]I'm just chilling for a second, just waiting for people to come in.
[05:35.15]Because there are a lot of people that really like this series.
[05:38.77]And I just made a tweet about it.
[05:41.85]It's been like a week since we last played it.
[05:43.39]So I'd rather like let people kind of trickle in.
[05:46.07]Like I sort of sometimes do every stream every single time.
[05:49.63]Every single stream.
[05:51.05]I'd say this every single fucking stream.
[05:53.91]That's okay.
[05:57.61]Have I ever considered playing Phantom Pain on stream?
[05:59.77]I bet you'd love it.
[06:01.92]I did love Phantom Pain.
[06:03.46]I played the hell out of it.
[06:05.32]It was one of my favorite games that came out last year.
[06:08.38]On stream, though, I don't know.
[06:11.26]Maybe.
[06:12.42]If it ever gets to a point where no games come out, because we've been pretty spoiled these last couple months.
[06:20.68]A lot of shit's come out, especially the last couple weeks and the next two weeks from now.
[06:26.55]But if it gets to a point where I run out of stuff that I want to stream, which I'm not sure it will because there's a lot of things I want to do.
[06:31.93]I don't know.
[06:37.47]Trickle in even when he's 10 minutes late.
[06:39.39]I was here at 7 o'clock.
[06:40.61]I was chatting in the chat room.
[06:45.11]I was speaking in the chat room.
[06:47.77]I just wasn't broadcasting my vocal cords live over the internet.
[06:51.79]But I was here.
[07:00.65]If you do play Metal Gear Solid V, there's a mod that adds a lot to the game.
[07:03.19]Yeah.
[07:04.95]Maybe someday.
[07:06.05]Maybe someday.
[07:10.88]Alright.
[07:12.08]I think we can get started.
[07:13.04]Am I going to play Final Fantasy XV?
[07:17.38]No.
[07:20.70]I have never played a Final Fantasy game from start to finish.
[07:24.73]Ever.
[07:25.29]In my whole life.
[07:28.67]I'm really trying to think about it.
[07:30.05]I think I played one of them.
[07:34.03]But never, I don't think, all the way through.
[07:38.43]In the 20 years that they've been making those games.
[07:44.74]Rev up those fryers.
[07:45.86]I'm hungry for some sorcery.
[07:49.32]Thanks, Baked Flakes.
[07:51.40]Welcome, Baked Flakes.
[07:53.26]The Resident Flakes.
[07:57.63]Does Jerry get the money we use on bits?
[08:00.77]Yes.
[08:02.61]Every single bit that you give me, I get it.
[08:08.64]Don't worry about that.
[08:13.10]I'm one of those people that thinks that... Hold on a second.
[08:19.89]So we can talk about this for a second.
[08:27.28]gaming talk for a minute.
[08:28.96]I'm one of those people that thinks that Square, Squaresoft, Square Enix has a horrible injustice of their franchising because they made two Chrono games and 15 Final Fantasies.
[08:46.51]Final Fantasy to me is like
[08:50.72]I could you know here's the thing I could care less about Final Fantasy as much as I care less about Call of Duty They're like the same thing to me They just they just come out all the fucking time They just number them see Call of Duty at least Call of Duty had the the wherewithal to stop numbering their new games Because right now would be it would be what like Call of Duty 17 or like Call of Duty 14 Something crazy like that.
[09:14.03]It'd be at least 10.
[09:14.75]I
[09:16.98]So Final Fantasy is just the Call of Duty of JRPGs.
[09:23.45]And they had an opportunity to make a third Chrono game, which I think is the much more interesting series.
[09:33.03]I played through Chrono Trigger and I played through Chrono Cross, and I heard that they were going to make Chrono Break.
[09:38.34]And I was ecstatic.
[09:39.86]I couldn't believe it.
[09:40.52]I was like, oh my God, they put a trademark in.
[09:42.82]Remember they put the trademark in?
[09:45.03]for Chrono Break.
[09:46.73]They could have capped the series, even if they didn't cap the series.
[09:49.71]Cool.
[09:51.31]But them putting in the trademark for Chrono Break and then making like seven more Final Fantasies was like a slap in the face to anybody that liked the Chrono series, which was, in my opinion, a ten fucking times better series than anything Final Fantasy has ever fucking made.
[10:06.36]Yeah.
[10:10.46]And even Kingdom Hearts, too.
[10:12.70]It's like taking them this long to make Kingdom Hearts 3.
[10:16.82]I know there's a lot of politics involved, but they have their Call of Duty.
[10:22.30]They have their Final Fantasy that they're going to pump out at least once every few years.
[10:26.83]What, every three or four years is a new Final Fantasy?
[10:29.83]Or even shorter than that, maybe.
[10:35.59]Do I watch Game Theory?
[10:37.13]Actually, I've watched a couple episodes way back in the day.
[10:43.10]And they had a ton of spin-offs.
[10:44.10]Yeah, they did.
[10:44.50]But there was a... Kingdom Hearts... Didn't Kingdom Hearts have, like, three mobile games?
[10:51.63]Like, it was like a card... There were, like, card games?
[10:53.97]Wasn't there a text game?
[10:58.09]Kingdom Hearts 3 had a lot of licensing issues thanks to Disney.
[11:01.95]Yeah.
[11:03.73]Probably.
[11:05.89]But... I'm sure they wanted... I'm sure they gotta get their Star Wars world in there.
[11:11.71]Can't wait to play Kingdom Hearts 3.
[11:21.02]Your dog passed away today.
[11:22.12]Would you mind giving hail?
[11:24.60]Is it Haley or hail?
[11:25.56]I'm assuming it's probably Haley.
[11:28.22]Well, God bless you, Haley or hail.
[11:30.92]Sorry to hear that, dude.
[11:35.54]Okay, I'm back from doing the laundry.
[11:36.78]I can start now.
[11:37.80]We're just doing a little bit of a gaming discussion.
[11:41.46]Before we go.
[11:44.57]Please no Star Wars world.
[11:45.67]Are you serious?
[11:46.17]There's going to be a Star Wars world.
[11:47.63]If there isn't, then that would be a huge mistake on Disney's part.
[11:52.11]They probably, like, forced him to redo the game to put Star Wars characters in it.
[11:59.20]Thank you, David.
[12:00.72]David.
[12:01.96]Davidi.
[12:03.78]Per 7.
[12:04.26]Also to Deman916.
[12:06.12]Thanks a lot.
[12:08.04]Brovalone500bits.
[12:09.52]You deserve this for getting me through this hellish week with your Hitman streams.
[12:14.55]Well, I hope you feel better, man.
[12:19.19]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[12:20.69]Appreciate it.
[12:23.06]Random guy, Coffee Cheetos Chicken.
[12:25.38]You know, there's gotta be.
[12:26.90]Okay, I gotta ask this question.
[12:29.46]Somebody enlighten me here.
[12:33.40]Me and Star made that video like two years ago, didn't we?
[12:37.00]Why is like all of a sudden that like, why is that a thing now?
[12:41.64]Did people like just find that video?
[12:44.22]I know he like watched it, sort of.
[12:46.71]Didn't he watch it like a few weeks ago or something?
[12:50.71]I see that everywhere now.
[12:55.93]Played it on his stream.
[12:56.65]Yeah, I like, I guess, yeah.
[12:59.97]I just keep seeing it.
[13:03.59]El Pepperoni, 13 months.
[13:05.69]13 months of this, Jeremy Moon, yeah.
[13:09.19]Welcome back, dude.
[13:11.07]13 months in a row.
[13:11.71]And speaking of 13 months in a row.
[13:14.39]And people that stay subscribed to this channel, I did say that like a week or two ago that I was working on sub badges and new intro screens and bit animations and proper music.
[13:26.97]It's all coming.
[13:27.89]So the two-year Jerma sub badge is going to be outrageous.
[13:35.04]There's a base, a three-month, six-month, 12-month, and two-year, right?
[13:43.24]It's coming soon.
[13:45.97]But yeah, thanks a lot man Thank You Yoshi Jake and with Yoshi Jake's subscription We are going to get going But I I have a very strong opinions on square and hold on a second What happened to Mario RPG?
[14:07.14]Why they stopped doing that?
[14:09.43]Why did they not do that?
[14:10.63]They made, like, they made Super Mario RPG, one of my favorite fucking video games ever, and a lot of people love that game.
[14:16.14]People consider that one of the best RPGs from the SNES, the golden years, whatever you want to call it, right?
[14:23.38]They just don't do it again?
[14:24.86]They've had plans to do it again, and they just didn't do it.
[14:28.70]And it became Paper Mario.
[14:30.04]And guess what?
[14:30.58]I'm going to give you a real unpopular opinion here.
[14:32.96]This is a really unpopular, bad opinion.
[14:34.78]Everyone's going to hate me.
[14:36.81]I think Paper Mario was fucking a dumb children's game.
[14:41.16]Alright, my hands are in the air.
[14:43.50]Don't shoot me.
[14:47.16]Super Mario RPG to Paper Mario?
[14:52.27]What the fuck happened there?
[15:05.87]Now, okay, let me say, I'll give you this, I'm going to let you down as softly as I can with this here.
[15:13.65]Paper Mario was a good game, right?
[15:16.49]It was a good game.
[15:18.01]It was a cool game.
[15:20.87]Mario RPG, fucking best fucking RPG, one of the best I've ever played.
[15:27.69]You can't go from Mario RPG to paper cutout goofball game.
[15:35.65]And then they made like a 10,000 year door.
[15:39.49]Close that fucking door and make Mario RPG 2.
[15:43.37]And I know what happened.
[15:44.89]Guys, I'm informed.
[15:46.03]I'm an informed person.
[15:47.39]I've read the news.
[15:48.84]The guys that made Mario RPG, they got, the director of that game got moved on to the Mario and Luigi saga, right?
[15:57.24]He made Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga.
[16:00.26]So they made, like, the director of the game that made one of the best fucking goddamn RPGs of the SNES years, they made him make a Game Boy Advance game.
[16:11.08]I've seen the news.
[16:12.14]I've read the pamphlets.
[16:14.97]Bullshit.
[16:19.27]Okay.
[16:20.51]Let's, um... And another thing!
[16:27.66]I know people love Paper Mario, but I, like, I've obviously just, I'm just, like, grabbing your chain, you know what I mean?
[16:36.77]I'm just kind of, I'm being, you know, I'm playing a little advocate here.
[16:41.93]I didn't hate Paper Mario.
[16:44.43]I just fucking hate Nintendo.
[16:46.99]It's not a big deal.
[16:50.55]No, I love Nintendo.
[16:52.01]Well, hold on, hold on.
[16:52.89]Let's put it this way.
[16:54.37]I love Nintendo from the years like 1988 to like 2004.
[17:00.73]You know what I mean?
[17:05.81]After like the, once they came out with the Wii, no, look, okay.
[17:11.62]There are several tables, both occupied and empty, and a little space at the bar.
[17:18.02]No, we already did the bar.
[17:18.82]Let's leave.
[17:24.07]Trying to redeem himself.
[17:34.30]Nintendo's been pretty stanky the last few years.
[17:40.38]Come on.
[17:41.30]At least give me that.
[17:43.26]This is from one of the biggest fans of the Super Nintendo.
[17:46.96]I used to get in fights with my... I used to get in fights with my friends.
[17:52.64]All the time.
[17:54.82]About how the Super Nintendo was better than the SEGA Genesis.
[17:59.08]We would get into real fights with each other.
[18:01.48]Like, friend-ending fights.
[18:04.00]And you know what?
[18:04.44]Every time I came back to it, what did I always come back to?
[18:06.78]Super Nintendo, my Super Nintendo guys.
[18:08.62]What did I always come back to?
[18:11.14]Why was the Super Nintendo better than the SEGA Genesis?
[18:13.91]Why?
[18:17.13]Because of the audio.
[18:18.43]The sound.
[18:20.51]The SEGA Genesis, every game used the same, like, fart noises.
[18:25.15]In all their games.
[18:26.57]It was like... That was in every game.
[18:30.94]That noise was in every single game.
[18:37.42]Super Nintendo had fantastic audio quality.
[18:41.38]Absolutely... Oh, jeez.
[18:43.93]Thank you for the countless hours of entertainment.
[18:46.77]Well, thank you totally raging.
[18:48.15]That's kind of... That's what I'm doing right now.
[18:51.52]Thank you for the 5,000 men, which I appreciate it.
[18:53.40]Dude, I remember just playing, like, Sonic.
[19:00.44]Alright, to close this out, I remember playing Sonic.
[19:02.66]I remember playing Com- Okay, first of all, Comic Zone?
[19:06.33]What a shit exclusive that was.
[19:07.95]Alright, at this point, I'm just, like, riling to rile.
[19:16.79]That's, like, all I'm doing now.
[19:17.97]Let's play Sorcery.
[19:23.24]They're both good systems.
[19:24.64]They're both great systems.
[19:27.14]One of them made an iconic video game character who still to this day is loved by millions and has lots of very high quality fantastic games.
[19:35.93]And the other one made an iconic video game character that now lives under a bridge and drinks out of a toilet seat.
[19:42.79]They're both very successful companies.
[19:45.21]And one of them closed down their hardware department permanently.
[19:47.51]They both did a very good job there.
[19:52.69]Alright, let's go.
[19:53.87]Okay, I didn't remember where we were.
[20:10.12]Which, you have to guess which one it was.
[20:13.07]Feels bad, Sonic.
[20:17.28]God, I fucking hate Sonic.
[20:19.27]It's like not even funny how much I don't like that character anymore.
[20:22.27]I used to love him.
[20:26.51]Master spots, thanks for the two months.
[20:35.04]Alright.
[20:38.16]I need to get in here.
[20:41.35]Let me open up the clues.
[20:42.41]Let's take a look, because it's been a week or so.
[20:44.25]Let's see what... The Throbin Doors.
[20:47.45]The central tower of the Archmage is guarded by the fearsome Throbin Doors.
[20:51.67]The Archmage can't see the doors.
[20:55.41]The third spell of the Throbin Doors is Invisibility.
[20:57.79]I remember we deduced that one with our deduction.
[21:01.23]Minimites prevent magic.
[21:02.68]Yeah.
[21:05.54]Breath of Mucalictics.
[21:06.86]I remember he wanted to talk to me.
[21:09.30]Yeah.
[21:11.47]Alright, I gotta get in the throw-open doors.
[21:13.59]I gotta find the... I guess... Wherever they are.
[21:21.57]They say the mage in the throw-open... They say the magic in the throw-open doors is so powerful the archmage cannot see or go near them.
[21:30.05]The archmage might even just be dead.
[21:31.90]Okay.
[21:34.76]So we need to get in here.
[21:35.98]He's right here.
[21:37.52]We need to find our way in.
[21:40.33]And yes, nana cats are invisible.
[21:43.67]Alright.
[21:44.83]You make way back into the alley.
[21:45.75]The stars turn the sky overhead.
[21:47.97]Look down the lane.
[21:48.93]Looking down the lane, you see a large tavern.
[21:50.62]Appears to be closed at the moment.
[21:52.32]The night air is cool and good for walking.
[21:58.28]Have we gone up here?
[22:00.92]I don't remember ever going in here.
[22:05.69]Over here, because I remember going in this building.
[22:07.79]I remember the gambling casino, which was down here.
[22:11.80]Where was the casino?
[22:13.34]Right here.
[22:14.90]Here's the casino.
[22:16.36]Here's where I got killed by that mucolytic.
[22:21.24]This is the kitchen.
[22:21.99]We were in there.
[22:24.97]Let's just keep going.
[22:31.46]Demon Days is a masterpiece of an album.
[22:32.92]Talk about it.
[22:34.53]Okay, for a second I thought this was still on the screen.
[22:36.29]I was about to go, oh shit.
[22:39.23]All the Gorillaz albums are masterpieces, in my opinion.
[22:42.81]Alright, we're back in the square.
[22:43.71]We've got to go to a place we haven't gone.
[22:47.62]I'm going to say... Because we've been in here.
[22:53.14]We've been down here.
[22:53.82]I fell off.
[22:54.32]The eagle brought me over here.
[22:55.18]We're going to go... I'm going to look up here.
[22:56.40]We're going to check out this area.
[22:57.39]This little town over here.
[23:03.40]Central statue.
[23:06.41]No, I haven't done everything here that I could.
[23:08.21]At least I think I did.
[23:12.03]Alright.
[23:13.79]The west side.
[23:14.67]We're going to go down this way.
[23:18.29]Oh, shit.
[23:18.77]Am I going to die?
[23:23.14]Died two more times and found three new clues.
[23:26.08]I'm going to die.
[23:26.78]Because I walked all night.
[23:29.92]Oh, okay.
[23:30.34]Okay.
[23:34.06]Uh, we've already been up here, I got that sword.
[24:04.82]Alright.
[24:06.04]You walk west out of the square following a wide road.
[24:08.90]Passes by the monastery gate.
[24:10.72]The early morning sun makes the air glow.
[24:13.14]Before you is a stone facade that stretches the length of the street.
[24:16.06]Two men in heavy robes sit on the steps.
[24:19.60]Continue along the road.
[24:20.68]This was the casino.
[24:23.36]We are now in territory we have not been.
[24:28.56]The road curves along the edge of a tall stone wall, eventually reaching a low metal door.
[24:32.53]A few clouds move across the heavens.
[24:37.91]Let's go in.
[24:39.17]Let's go in.
[24:40.75]You push the door and are surprised to find it is not locked.
[24:43.17]It is, however, heavy enough that it swings shut when you release it.
[24:48.75]The door is made of thin strips of metal riveted together with a few gaps and holes between the plates.
[24:55.01]Peering through the holes, you make out a sea of waving grass stalks, tall and heavy.
[24:59.25]Oh, no, no.
[24:59.71]Okay.
[24:59.87]I thought I was talking about this door.
[25:01.83]Yeah.
[25:02.61]We've already been down there.
[25:03.65]We're going to keep going this way.
[25:06.82]You continue along the road, you pass a side street leading off into a maze of smaller streets and alleys.
[25:13.68]Let's go up here.
[25:17.41]Because I know what lies this way.
[25:19.01]It's all these weird fucking domes.
[25:22.31]Let's see if we can get any more investigative reporting here.
[25:28.72]Okay.
[25:29.30]Well, I'm currently disguised, right?
[25:30.46]They wouldn't be able to... I'm just gonna keep walking.
[25:58.50]You continue walking towards them, your pace steady and breath even.
[26:02.52]Nearing the three, you can make out snatches of talk.
[26:06.56]But how did you manage it?
[26:08.24]If I said the word, could I do it?
[26:10.68]No, no, no, no.
[26:11.90]You need to know how to say it.
[26:13.78]Using your will to channel the light.
[26:15.87]Not just a matter of spouting off a word or two.
[26:18.97]As they pass by, one peers at your face.
[26:21.51]His eyes widen.
[26:28.60]The captain raises her hands.
[26:29.83]That was a girl.
[26:30.69]Opening them apart.
[26:31.49]You see electricity dancing between her palms.
[26:36.17]She's gonna zap me.
[26:38.45]You wanna zap?
[26:39.41]You wanna go zap for zap?
[26:40.45]Is that what she wants to do?
[26:44.40]I think she wants to go zap for zap.
[26:49.38]No, I can't.
[26:49.86]I have three stamina.
[26:53.94]Can I, like, get to know this girl?
[26:55.22]I feel like we have a lot in common.
[26:58.92]No, I kind of, uh... Oh, boy.
[27:01.50]I think I'm dead here.
[27:06.66]Can I just foff?
[27:07.53]No.
[27:12.03]Yeah, this is invisibility.
[27:14.17]Invisibility!
[27:17.38]Uh oh, she's gonna read my mind.
[27:18.64]I have to attack.
[27:39.13]You approach with Snaticat-like stealth and run through the first guard.
[27:43.72]He gurgles with surprise and horror as he falls.
[27:46.82]But the captain is not slow to react.
[27:49.20]Of course!
[27:50.54]She opens her wide and... She opens her wide and begins casting something.
[27:57.38]Shit.
[28:00.85]Uh... Um... I mean, she... You think she's gonna zap me again?
[28:07.01]Should I just wait?
[28:11.35]I might just have to stab her, right?
[28:18.39]Stab her.
[28:20.45]You twist to stab her next, but before you can reach her, her spell is complete and your invisibility shatters.
[28:26.04]She reacts, your blade moments from her neck.
[28:28.74]Tumbling backwards and drawing her own blade, you have wounded her at least.
[28:34.34]Uh, yeah.
[28:35.62]You're dead.
[28:40.19]I can do it full blast again.
[28:41.49]Dead.
[28:43.95]This sword is amazing.
[28:47.83]This sword is sick.
[28:49.81]I get so much more fighting stamina.
[28:53.07]You keep up the pressure, swinging with expert precision in all your strength.
[28:56.29]While you cannot catch her off guard, you can overwhelm the captain.
[28:59.82]Every strike weakens her.
[29:01.58]Until she eventually provides you with an opening, you thrust your blade through her neck, and she falls.
[29:05.92]Flawless fighting.
[29:11.13]As their captain falls, the guards scatter in fear.
[29:14.89]Searcher.
[29:16.28]Searching her pockets, you find a blimberry potion that will come in handy.
[29:19.48]You also realize that the uniform is not too badly damaged, and about your size.
[29:23.96]Though if you were to wear it, you will have to take off the monk's habit and leave it behind.
[29:30.13]Can pretend to be a guard.
[29:34.86]I think I'm gonna do that.
[29:35.96]Put it on.
[29:36.32]Ooh.
[29:37.10]Oh, you did it!
[29:37.46]Okay.
[30:02.54]Which way do you guys want to go next?
[30:04.30]Let's do a first drop-off.
[30:08.77]Which way do you guys want to go?
[30:11.29]Do you want to go towards, like, the laughing, playing children that you hear in the background?
[30:22.29]Still playing Hitman.
[30:24.33]What?
[30:27.28]It should say I'm playing, uh, sorcery.
[30:29.92]What?
[30:34.10]It should be breaching the Citadel.
[30:36.14]Sorcery 4, Chronic Kings.
[30:39.72]Did it not work?
[30:46.14]Okay.
[30:48.13]Alley.
[30:49.65]Warehouse.
[30:52.09]What broken building?
[30:56.39]Create the pole.
[30:59.91]Please vote.
[31:02.77]Please vote.
[31:06.21]What's going on here?
[31:12.17]Wait, wait, what?
[31:16.99]What's going on?
[31:18.11]Why are people saying FailFish?
[31:19.83]What did I do?
[31:25.73]It's a disguise joke.
[31:27.51]What?
[31:30.81]This is way over my head right now.
[31:37.79]Oh, it's because it's the debate.
[31:39.11]Okay.
[31:39.75]Okay.
[31:40.29]Alright.
[31:40.71]It took me a second.
[31:41.53]I get it.
[31:42.31]Because they put on a new disguise.
[31:45.54]I thought people said that it still said I was playing Hitman.
[31:50.34]Give me a break.
[31:54.40]It's an easy mistake to make.
[31:55.65]Stop scolding me.
[31:59.15]Stop scolding me.
[32:03.06]Alright.
[32:03.32]This is going to end in about five seconds.
[32:06.18]Looks like Broken Building and Warehouse are currently fighting for their lives.
[32:18.08]Oh, boy.
[32:18.56]I don't know.
[32:18.88]I can't close it yet.
[32:20.48]It's too close.
[32:21.00]Am I about to get run over by a steed?
[32:24.78]What the hell is going on?
[32:31.22]Alright.
[32:32.80]3, 2, 1.
[32:34.71]Poll is closed.
[32:36.25]Thank you for voting.
[32:36.85]Broken building has won by a mere 13 votes.
[32:41.42]Thank you for voting.
[32:42.10]We're going to the building.
[32:44.54]Broken building.
[32:51.33]Well, this sucked.
[32:51.79]This sucked!
[33:19.15]It's just like to get across to the market?
[33:21.31]That's all that did?
[33:25.32]Uh... Oh, boy.
[33:35.36]Well... What happens if I, like, cross it?
[33:39.54]Is it gonna... You emerge from the ruins of a house into the edge of the market.
[33:44.29]The market is busy with traders and a stall's city...
[33:48.74]No, we already did this.
[33:50.28]Oh, God.
[33:50.95]And I can't rewind.
[33:51.79]I can't rewind.
[33:54.89]I have to go back into the square and walk around in a circle.
[34:02.37]Oh, whoops-a-daisy.
[34:03.27]We're going to go back around.
[34:06.86]Oh, God.
[34:08.94]It's just like a way to cut across if you want to.
[34:12.18]Democracy.
[34:14.06]Democracy at its finest.
[34:18.80]Well, looks like we're going in the warehouse.
[34:24.36]Kind of threw a day in the garbage can.
[34:30.42]Hey, look at that.
[34:31.54]We made it back.
[34:32.54]Let's go into the warehouse.
[34:36.58]You slip into a warehouse inside plenty of empty space.
[34:39.94]Some of it lined with straw.
[34:41.66]The interior is quiet and dark.
[34:44.99]Search the straw.
[34:46.89]You search around in a straw to see if anything has been left behind from the last time this place was stocked.
[34:51.37]And in one corner, you find a gold-backed mirror.
[34:54.23]What a stroke of luck!
[34:55.59]You head for the door once more.
[34:58.36]Outside.
[34:59.82]You head to the side street where you... Wow, what great choices these were!
[35:05.04]Don't worry.
[35:05.46]Eventually, you're just gonna go this way anyway.
[35:07.18]Alright.
[35:11.42]You...
[35:14.44]You make your way along the quiet, debris-strewn alleyway.
[35:18.56]There's nothing here but silence and the faintest smell of death.
[35:21.92]Clouds rumble as they roll across the dimming sky.
[35:25.16]Rest and eat something.
[35:27.14]You eat a quantity of your cheese and bread and feel much better for it.
[35:30.20]Suddenly, a door bursts open next to you.
[35:32.60]A woman sprints out of it and then slams it closed.
[35:35.74]Leaning against it, she takes a series of heavy breathing breaths.
[35:41.69]Look at her.
[35:43.31]She is dressed in a loose cloth shirt with a bandana tied across her forehead.
[35:47.78]A notched cutlass hangs from her belt.
[35:50.08]She looks at you after catching her breath.
[35:53.94]Can I help you?
[35:57.20]What are you running from?
[35:59.06]A crooked grin appears on her face.
[36:03.04]Ranni Goldini, at your service, she says.
[36:06.70]I just emerged from a small disagreement with some goblins.
[36:10.19]Nothing to worry about, really.
[36:14.44]What a disagreement.
[36:17.05]The goblins and I were just discussing certain irregularities in their finances.
[36:24.45]Goblins don't keep finances.
[36:28.59]These ones don't keep them, no.
[36:31.11]Not a coin.
[36:32.16]I ran circles around the silly creatures and robbed them blind.
[36:35.76]She pushes herself up and away from the wall.
[36:40.27]Punches the mic.
[36:55.91]Look at the building.
[36:56.47]The buildings here are clearly inhabited, used only by ManPang's lowest threat of society.
[37:01.83]These are people without a hope.
[37:02.97]You turn to return down the street.
[37:06.57]What the fuck?
[37:07.61]This area sucked.
[37:17.99]Where are my choices?
[37:20.59]I can't do anything.
[37:21.35]I want to go up here.
[37:22.19]Did I fuck something up?
[37:27.13]Let's go on the main road.
[37:29.95]You turn to the main road.
[37:33.15]Did she run away?
[37:33.95]I'm dressed as a guard captain.
[37:35.17]Did she run away from me because of that?
[37:39.87]The road leads away towards a ruined portion of the citadel.
[37:42.02]Night has fallen.
[37:42.58]You are suffering badly.
[37:44.20]You need to rest.
[37:46.80]Fuck.
[37:47.76]Can I sleep by the gate?
[37:52.11]The road ends in a tall wall of obsidian black bricks, tall enough to keep out a giant.
[37:56.57]But the wall is crumbled, brought down by the piercing gripweed vines that cover its length.
[38:01.90]You could scramble over the fallen stones and inside easily enough.
[38:05.56]The moon rises.
[38:09.38]You scramble up onto the block and peer over the wall.
[38:12.31]Beyond stretches an empty region of lapping water from which tall, isolated, gloomy towers rise.
[38:19.87]Um, these are like the death chambers, right?
[38:24.61]Why is the guard captain sleeping in the gutter and dying of starvation?
[38:32.17]You scramble up and over the broken wall into a narrow strand of stone on the edge of a watery pool.
[38:37.92]Towers rise on all sides connected by spidery paths.
[38:41.14]Sand is scattered over the edge of the pool.
[38:44.04]Collect up some sand.
[38:45.90]You scoop up a couple handfuls of usable sand.
[38:47.74]The path between the towers awaits.
[38:52.11]So, okay, like each one of these is a...
[38:55.83]soup can of horrors.
[38:59.16]Because it seemed like I've all the I've gone into like two or three of them so far and they're all just like weird like freak shows.
[39:07.36]Alright, let's go.
[39:11.43]Okay, let's...
[39:41.38]Alright, which tower?
[39:43.80]Am I going in this tower or this tower?
[39:45.54]Because wait, I was over on this side.
[39:47.82]No, wait, what side was I on?
[39:51.22]I think I was on this side, wasn't I?
[39:52.89]Where was like the goblin torture chamber?
[40:02.41]I'm going to go on this one.
[40:05.37]They're all bad.
[40:08.17]You're crossing the stepstones over the dangerous waters once more.
[40:11.29]The moon moves slowly across the dark sky.
[40:13.14]Another junction.
[40:14.38]A low tower to the west is set into the wall of the citadel.
[40:17.18]Another tower blocks your way north.
[40:19.60]Sleep here.
[40:21.74]Laying your pack down, you try to rest despite the strange noises that drift through the air.
[40:25.97]At least you've eaten once already today, so do not need to eat again to avoid hunger.
[40:29.87]Though more food will make you stronger.
[40:31.27]I'm going to drink a potion.
[40:35.75]close your eyes after you drink and dream you roll over trying to sleep but you cannot seem to rest after a while you get to your feet and begin to walk through the darkness crumbling walls and broken towers move past on either side you are walking past an old crumbling building when you hear voices listen
[40:57.50]You listen closer.
[40:59.02]Leaning against the wall, it sounds like a distant crowd, too far even to be on the other side of the wall.
[41:05.03]Where are these voices coming from?
[41:09.05]Knock on the wall.
[41:10.27]You wrap the wall, and a chorus of tiny screams rings out in response.
[41:15.59]Look over the wall.
[41:16.89]Looking over the wall, you spot a missing brick.
[41:19.77]A green-gray mold has covered the gap, coating the interior with fuzz.
[41:26.80]As you lean down to peer at the mold, you realize the voices are growing louder.
[41:31.34]Poke the mold.
[41:32.72]You poke at one of the mold lumps, which squishes slightly.
[41:36.02]It springs back into shape quickly.
[41:38.10]Another chorus of screams emanates from the mold itself.
[41:42.35]But then something else catches your eye.
[41:43.89]Movement.
[41:44.71]Hundreds of tiny specks swarm across the surface of the brick, fleeing the spot of your poking.
[41:49.69]What could they be?
[41:52.85]Follow the movement.
[41:54.35]You watch the hypnotic patterns in the mold moving this way and that.
[41:58.52]They seem to grow as you stare, becoming first veins, then branches, then finally streets and roads.
[42:03.64]The world around you is filling with gray and the air turns to fuzz and smoke.
[42:09.06]Then you are sitting in a valley of soft gray grass.
[42:14.33]This is a pretty fucking weird dream.
[42:18.63]Look around.
[42:21.09]Hello?
[42:21.23]This is a long fucking dream!
[42:43.64]You climb the hill for a better view.
[42:45.86]You now look down into another valley, ringed by hills.
[42:49.57]Nestled at the foot is an extraordinary sight.
[42:54.01]Huts, creatures, a rotting bone the size of a whale.
[42:59.91]Dude, I probably shouldn't have had, like, a Snickers bar before going to bed.
[43:04.26]That voice crack?
[43:05.24]Don't ever talk about my voice crack.
[43:10.40]When did I voice crack?
[43:13.05]Creatures.
[43:14.77]Creatures.
[43:15.99]They're hard to make out from this distance, but you see them hurrying to and fro in their huts.
[43:20.19]From this distance, they appear to be shapeless blobs, the same color as the mold.
[43:24.47]They have recovered from your poking, though their movements are still rushed.
[43:29.62]They move along the ground by simply rolling.
[43:31.58]It seems you have been spotted.
[43:37.04]Cover up your voice crack.
[43:37.92]I want to hear it.
[43:38.60]Somebody clip it.
[43:40.00]Go get it.
[43:43.96]What the fuck is going on right now?
[43:45.76]Okay, I'm just gonna wait.
[43:47.82]Jesus.
[43:50.06]You stay where you are, watching them climb.
[43:52.65]They're quite dexterous in their rolling, managing to stay in a straight line, even as their eyes continually lose sight of their destination.
[44:03.67]Jesus.
[44:04.73]Just like the mold of the hills and huts, they're covered in a soft fuzz and squish a little when making contact with the ground.
[44:11.00]They soon reach the top of the hill.
[44:13.36]One rolls forward and begins to speak in a rough imitation of the common tongue.
[44:17.97]Its voice sounds like a bag of pebbles, so it's a bit hard to follow.
[44:27.51]I can't do it.
[44:28.10]I don't have a bag of pebbles here.
[44:30.04]I don't have a bag of anything.
[44:32.96]Welcome.
[44:34.08]We are the gillis.
[44:36.62]This is our home.
[44:38.63]You've been summoned by Mucor's magic.
[44:41.59]His voice is terrible.
[44:44.43]Would you come down to the village?
[44:51.72]Who's Mucor?
[44:54.48]Who's Mucor?
[44:55.97]The gillis bounces up and down.
[44:57.17]Uh...
[45:23.53]Sounds like he's underwater.
[45:24.51]Well, he's like a bouncy blob of green jello.
[45:28.50]Yes, I will help you.
[45:30.52]The gillis puffs up with pleasure.
[45:32.00]Oh, excellent.
[45:34.34]This way, please.
[45:36.52]You will notice most do not speak your tongue.
[45:39.16]I myself... Oh, you will notice that we don't speak your tongue.
[45:43.03]I myself only learn through careful study with passing thunderstorms.
[45:47.87]You follow the group down the hill, chatting with your escort.
[45:50.90]You follow them to a village built on thousands of levels and in thousands of directions, made of spindles and spires and webbed threads.
[45:59.30]Where the fuck am I?
[46:01.60]The creatures gather around you, pawing at your body, your clothing and possessions, fascinated, appalled and uninhibited.
[46:09.93]Who are you?
[46:12.78]We are the memories of this place.
[46:17.06]The gillis replies in a co- I'm not doing that joke again.
[46:21.10]In a chorus, no.
[46:21.88]Just pretend there's like 30 of us doing this.
[46:24.81]This place is too old and yet lives.
[46:28.19]They try to feed you from the rotten meat around which their village is built.
[46:31.75]One tries to caress you with tendrils pushed deep up your nostrils.
[46:36.55]You cough and choke violently as the mold fills your mouth and eyes.
[46:43.02]What?
[46:47.41]What happened?
[46:48.77]You ate one- What?
[46:57.77]You pick yourself to your feet and try to shake away your more curious dreams.
[47:02.75]The wind picks up a little spray from the water and splashes into your face.
[47:05.78]It stings where it touches you.
[47:10.18]What was the point of that entire conversation?
[47:16.29]Do I need to go back to bed to talk to those people?
[47:22.14]Dream.
[47:23.58]Dream mold.
[47:26.74]Uh, okay.
[47:27.92]Well... That was a dream.
[47:37.31]I went to bed, and like I said, I shouldn't eat a Snickers before bed.
[47:40.43]Alright, you lean out over the path and look down into the water.
[47:43.37]It is black, reflectionless, as though infinitely deep.
[47:48.14]Who gives a shit?
[47:48.72]I'm not wasting a stone.
[47:51.14]The North Tower.
[47:53.95]The path across the water ends outside the next tower and despite there being a door, you cannot go further.
[47:59.73]It is surrounded by a curious, shimmering shield.
[48:06.90]Touch the shield.
[48:10.73]You run your hands over the smooth force field.
[48:13.11]It is definitely magical in nature.
[48:15.31]It has the subtle give and deep strength of a force field bubble.
[48:20.24]But how is it so large and how has it lasted for so long?
[48:23.30]And who is casting it?
[48:32.21]Hold on.
[48:39.15]Hold on a second.
[48:46.40]That's force field, right?
[48:53.03]The plot thickens.
[48:56.89]The plot.
[48:58.11]The plot thickens.
[49:00.95]That was like Paul Bearer.
[49:03.60]Boom.
[49:06.80]You cast the spell, scattering sand around the base of the tower, but no whirlpool forms.
[49:11.48]Rather, the force field begins to shimmer, and then to steam and smoke, and finally it disappears.
[49:17.94]The tower is now open for you to explore.
[49:19.75]A foff spell, then, successfully countered by your enchantment.
[49:24.71]Yeah, but I already knew that.
[49:29.27]Let's go inside.
[49:30.85]There is now nothing to stop you from going inside the tower.
[49:33.17]What was it that was being so fiercely protected?
[49:40.23]The inside of the tower is spartan.
[49:41.91]In the middle sits a table on which a piece of paper lies.
[49:44.38]A pile of yellow sand is scattered around the table's feet.
[49:48.16]Look at the paper.
[49:49.88]The paper is littered with scrawled notes, a few simple star geometrics, as any acolyte of magic might learn in the beginning of a technical discussion of countermagic.
[50:01.49]Continue reading.
[50:02.85]The paper continues with sketchy detail, though an interesting conclusion.
[50:07.32]Countermagic is a fact of the universe, thoroughly proven.
[50:10.66]There is no magic, no matter how strong, which cannot be countermanded if correctly identified.
[50:15.88]Even the great artifact itself, once thoroughly understood, can be overcome.
[50:22.90]Time to move on.
[50:28.31]Okay.
[50:33.17]Counterspells.
[50:36.95]countermagic why would you be a piece of paper like that needs to be put in a place like this you sure are you sure it was snickers I don't know who knows a lot of things look like snickers north tower let's just keep going
[50:56.55]The early morning sun makes the air glow.
[50:58.89]You cross the waters and push your way inside the crumbling tower without knowing what you might find.
[51:03.67]The room you find is filled with statues frozen in various poses.
[51:07.52]An icy hush fills the air.
[51:09.68]Is this a gallery of some sort?
[51:15.44]A slip between the statues.
[51:18.44]You step further into the room.
[51:19.86]There's no furniture.
[51:21.32]And from the dust, it seems no one has been here for a long time.
[51:24.93]The statues make the room hard to navigate.
[51:26.87]They cluster and clutter the floor.
[51:30.77]Okay, it's going to be like the Roman Empire is going to come out and attack me.
[51:36.60]Let me see here.
[51:44.73]Uh, pep.
[51:46.49]I don't have any fire water.
[51:50.09]Uh...

[54:24.81]I just pumped the microphone.
[54:26.37]That's what Zob does.
[54:27.17]You just saw it.
[54:27.89]It makes me bump the mic.
[54:32.37]Let's see the future.
[54:33.91]Let's do far.
[54:34.73]Let's just take a look at the future.
[54:41.86]Why not?
[54:44.74]See the future.
[54:48.82]Okay.
[55:17.72]So, are these people zombies with the plague and they froze them all in here for a reason?
[55:32.64]The only woman who would ever give you love.
[55:34.44]Oh, damn, that was harsh.
[55:35.38]Okay, I'm going to look around the room.
[55:39.40]Look around the room.
[55:42.14]You slip this way and that between the statues.
[55:44.14]The detail on them is extraordinary.
[55:46.15]Their bodies are exquisitely...
[55:50.61]prosaically, prosaically, prosaically, posed.
[55:57.62]I didn't learn this word in school.
[55:59.38]Nobody else did.
[55:59.92]Did you guys learn this word in school?
[56:01.64]I didn't.
[56:03.38]They're very nicely posed.
[56:05.70]Their faces seem soft enough to stroke.
[56:07.69]Whoever sculpted them was a rare talent.
[56:10.27]The eyes of the statue seem to follow you as you move.
[56:19.79]Uh...
[56:22.19]Look for doors.
[56:23.27]I'm not touching anybody.
[56:25.41]Yeah, I just had that dream.
[56:30.83]You make your way across the room looking for a way forwards and there is one, but a statue blocks it neatly.
[56:36.43]It has been posed as though racing for the door.
[56:45.40]Look at the statue by the door.
[56:49.40]Wait, what?
[56:50.32]The statue in the doorway is of a middle-aged woman.
[56:53.83]One hand is raised in the air and her face tilts upwards.
[56:57.63]I'm gonna have to blow my nose.
[56:58.75]I'm sorry.
[56:59.07]Hold on.
[57:13.37]alright the statue in the door was a middle-aged woman one hand is raised in the air and her face tilts upward as though she was holding up and examining an object that is no longer there the statue is exquisitely done including fine details such as eyelashes and a lined face someone must have labored long on this but wait did one of the statues move look above the door
[57:41.09]You follow the statue's eyeline to a point above the door, inscribed there is a symbol.
[57:46.63]Two.
[57:49.12]You feel a coldness on your arms.
[57:52.88]Two.
[57:57.93]Fuck.
[57:59.89]Don't blink.
[58:14.79]Fucking Zob, I'm not... Zap?
[58:15.55]No, Zap's not gonna do shit.
[58:24.11]What counters stone statues?
[58:32.00]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait wait wait.
[58:39.00]One hand is raised in the air and her face tilts upwards although she was holding up and examining a object that is no longer there.
[58:46.65]You follow the statue's eyeline to a point above the door.
[58:51.50]So, why is she looking up at the door?
[58:54.82]Should I float up to the door?
[58:56.10]Like, up to the symbol?
[59:02.62]That's the only thing I can do in here.
[59:05.64]All these other options don't seem to make any sense.
[59:10.03]We need to yap talk with... There's no animals in here.
[59:14.69]Yob is summoning a giant.
[59:19.74]If I summon a giant, then what's gonna happen in here?
[59:22.15]I have no idea.
[59:22.81]What, am I gonna sit down and play chess with him?
[59:24.97]Are we gonna play huge person chess?
[59:32.93]The two has a pause button.
[59:36.71]Oh my god.
[59:42.84]What a fucking genius that guy in chat is.
[59:46.04]You follow the statue's eyeline and inscribe there's a symbol.
[59:49.03]It's a pause button.
[59:52.61]Somebody give that guy all the credit because he just figured out the secret of this place.
[59:57.27]I have to hit the play button.
[59:58.09]I have to like go touch that and hit play.
[60:04.32]How funny would that be if I went up and touched that symbol and it turned into a play symbol?
[60:12.61]Well, it's either going to be float or giant.
[60:19.29]I can howl.
[60:20.47]Find safe passage.
[60:26.77]I feel like if I cast this, they're all going to attack me because I'm already being culled by somebody in here.
[60:37.19]I'm going to float.
[60:41.48]She's looking in the air, her eyes are following into the air, like, it's definitely saying, like, hey, you need to float over there!
[60:47.87]Let's do it.
[60:50.99]You move the starlight into order around you, but your weight does not change.
[60:54.17]Instead, stone begins to flake off the skin of the statues!
[60:58.90]Wait a minute, this is not good.
[61:00.12]Aren't they, like, the plague?
[61:07.22]Didn't it say that she was, like, a zombie?
[61:16.81]So this is the counterspell.
[61:20.63]I'm gonna watch.
[61:21.99]You watch in amazement.
[61:23.07]It is as though a strong wind is blowing through the chamber and shearing the stone to shreds.
[61:28.69]As more and more flecks of rock fall, something green and fetid pink is revealed beneath the stone.
[61:33.13]Okay, I need to like... I already saw the future.
[61:42.86]Look away.
[61:45.89]You turn away, the sudden rotting smell is enough to tell you all you need to know of what lies inside the statue's stone hulls.
[61:51.13]A counterspell, then.
[61:52.39]So the spell of lightness opposes the enchantment of petrification.
[61:56.41]Cool.
[61:56.93]Good.
[61:57.83]Very good.
[61:59.27]Corpses, you are standing in a room of the posed dead.
[62:03.01]And entombed for so long, they stay posed.
[62:05.55]The gallery of stone becomes a gallery of gray flesh.
[62:11.79]Away, away, run away.
[62:13.67]Look at them.
[62:16.52]Oh, I'm gonna get some disease.
[62:17.90]I know it.
[62:18.32]Dead men bend to scoop up unseen children.
[62:23.02]Blank-eyed women stare at each other across the room.
[62:26.06]One has her mouth open mid-speech.
[62:28.85]One corpse still blocks the door.
[62:30.57]Ugh.
[62:35.41]I wanna just dig my hands in and try to find some gold.
[62:39.71]Dig in.
[62:41.14]You search the corpses, nearly gagging from the smell and softness of their flesh.
[62:45.98]You find nothing of note.
[62:47.85]Perhaps they were stripped of their valuables before they were turned to stone.
[62:50.95]Perhaps they had nothing to begin with.
[62:52.57]Who knows how they were lured to this place.
[62:56.25]Alright, shift the corpse.
[62:58.83]Without the shell of stone, the corpse is easy to move.
[63:00.81]It is an unwelcome task, but you swallow your disgust.
[63:04.44]The way forward is now clear.
[63:06.14]The corpses stare at your back as you leave.
[63:13.59]Okay.
[63:17.81]That was disgusting.
[63:19.41]Puke, puke, puke.
[63:22.91]You step back... You step back out onto the path and follow it a short way.
[63:26.98]The air stirs a little, still cold, but fresh.
[63:29.56]You stop in the shadow of a large tower to the north.
[63:36.32]This tower is slightly taller than the others.
[63:38.52]Over the doorway is a carved, short message.
[63:41.60]Guard yourself!
[63:46.78]Did they mean like literally or did they mean magically?
[63:56.11]It's probably talking magically, right?
[63:58.77]Guard yourself.
[63:59.35]Protect from magic.
[64:00.07]Oh, what's the other one?
[64:02.53]F.O.F.
[64:06.03]Zip.
[64:07.63]Zen.
[64:08.15]I could float.
[64:10.09]No, it's definitely telling me to put on a fucking magical shield.
[64:12.43]I'm not that stupid.
[64:13.39]Oh, wait a minute.
[64:15.37]Wait a minute.
[64:15.71]Wait a minute.
[64:16.01]Wait a minute.
[64:16.29]Wait a minute.
[64:19.25]Okay, guys, do they mean figuratively or do they mean actually?
[64:24.78]Guard yourself.
[64:31.86]Wall?
[64:33.52]I don't know what they mean.
[64:35.92]What does it all mean?
[64:45.67]Walk?
[64:46.57]Make the shield both?
[64:47.71]I don't think I can do both.
[64:57.50]See, my gut instinct would say that it would be this.
[65:00.38]Would be magic protection.
[65:03.92]But... Walk, walk, do a pull.
[65:08.85]Alright, we'll do a pull.
[65:10.93]Because I seriously don't know which one of these it is.
[65:15.29]Which one?
[65:15.61]Are we doing magic protection or physical protection?
[65:29.01]Magic or physical let the mob decide Let the mob decide the outcome Physical seems to be winning oh no no no no
[65:56.02]Dude, is this going to be one of those situations where ask the audience ends up not working?
[66:01.40]Physical still winning by a little bit.
[66:05.00]Now as I say that.
[66:08.77]Sense danger on it?
[66:09.49]I could do that.
[66:11.17]But do I still have an opportunity after sensing danger to protect myself?
[66:17.21]If I look up at a sign I walk forward and there's all these weird Spooky fucked up towers and the sign immediately says guard yourself I'm not gonna look at that sign and go I Wonder what that means I'm gonna sense the sign I'm gonna get hit by a fucking brick is gonna come out someone's gonna whip a brick like home alone 2 style Down at me and hit me right in the forehead Magic is winning
[66:45.72]Magic is winning.
[66:47.58]Sense democracy.
[66:50.24]Holy shit, this is such a- What a swing election.
[66:52.98]This is such a swing election.
[66:55.22]Physical just looked like it was gonna take it over again.
[67:01.33]You're gonna walk into a zap tower with a gold coin on your wrist.
[67:07.83]I hope it's empty.
[67:10.48]Election joke.
[67:13.09]Well, I think the people have spoken.
[67:15.33]Ten more seconds.
[67:16.99]Looks like it's going to be magic.
[67:23.08]It would say, protect yourself, not guard.
[67:25.40]I don't know.
[67:32.50]Well, I'm leaving it up to the audience.
[67:36.67]And in five seconds, it's closed.
[67:38.35]And magic protection is what we're going to be using.
[67:42.10]5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
[67:45.36]We're doing magic protection.
[67:47.22]Thank you for voting.
[67:48.09]That was my gut reaction as well.
[67:51.27]Who knows?
[67:51.65]There are 49% of everybody that voted that think otherwise.
[67:56.09]But thank you for voting.
[67:56.73]That's it.
[67:57.83]Let us put on magic protection.
[68:01.19]Protect from magic.
[68:04.90]You weave the enchantment and a veil of magical protection shimmers into place around you.
[68:10.08]Or can I do both?
[68:11.20]Can I just do both?
[68:13.33]Alright, you get two presidents.
[68:14.73]Because I'm doing both.
[68:21.41]I love how like all these elections didn't matter.
[68:24.27]This is like the second or this is the third election that didn't even matter.
[68:30.48]I'm going in double protection.
[68:39.09]You place a gold piece on your wrist and cast a spell, and a moment later the coin is gone.
[68:42.28]You feel the weight of an invisible shield on your arm.
[68:44.28]You feel somewhat reassured by the shield's weight.
[68:46.64]Let's go.
[68:48.34]Let's go in.
[68:49.86]Go in the tower.
[68:51.66]You get two presidents.
[68:54.76]you enter the tower you have the sense of some strong magic here but your spell of magic protection is keeping you safe however you should not wait too long you feel the magic on you fading as you leave the tower either the world expands once more or more likely you shrink to your normal size what so it was magic but what is it what what the does this mean there's nothing in here
[69:25.78]What?
[69:26.92]It was empty.
[69:29.54]It was fucking empty.
[69:30.60]It was an empty tower.
[69:35.00]Okay.
[69:37.13]You return to the path and walk a short distance.
[69:38.99]Your shield shimmers out of existence.
[69:40.87]Your veil shimmers out of existence.
[69:43.01]And there's some clouds in the sky.
[69:47.69]Well... Okay.
[69:51.51]Whatever you say...
[69:54.89]Uh, we're just gonna stay on the edge here.
[69:56.57]We're gonna go in.
[69:59.51]As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise.
[70:01.69]You enter the next tower nervously.
[70:03.83]This tower seems quiet and empty.
[70:06.33]The only curious feature is a crack that splits the floor in half.
[70:10.05]It lies between you and the door on the other side.
[70:16.20]That's not just a regular crack.
[70:19.06]The crack is perfectly straight and is more like a cut than a crack, as though someone had split the tower in two across its middle and slid the two halves apart.
[70:31.91]I got plenty of money.
[70:33.79]But if I throw the coin, then I'm not going to have 69.
[70:38.53]Right?
[70:38.87]Somebody right?
[70:39.93]Right?
[70:42.87]Right?
[70:43.13]You know what I mean?
[70:47.56]Yeah.
[70:49.44]Right?
[70:49.98]Unbelievable.
[70:50.58]Okay, please nominate me for Twitch joke of the fucking century!
[70:54.82]Alright, we're gonna throw a coin.
[70:59.11]You pull a coin from your pack and toss it experimentally across the chamber.
[71:01.95]It travels halfway as far as the crack, no less, and then bounces off something you cannot see.
[71:07.53]You pick it up once more.
[71:14.60]So, it is an invisible wall.
[71:19.66]So what counters wall?
[71:29.24]I don't know.
[71:29.62]Let's find out.
[71:30.30]What counters wall?
[71:36.89]Gob?
[71:38.29]What counters wall?
[71:39.25]Goblin.
[71:40.85]Alright, so I just have to gobble him until he runs into the wall?
[71:43.77]Hold on, this might be actually kind of funny.
[71:46.82]I'm going to summon a goblin and tell him to just open the door on the other side and have him just run into the wall.
[71:55.01]That sounds like fun.
[71:59.59]Huff.
[72:00.19]I don't think wind is going to knock the wall down.
[72:04.77]Hot.
[72:05.39]I don't think hot will do it.
[72:10.62]Goblin.
[72:12.50]Cast what?
[72:13.30]What?
[72:16.94]Pop.
[72:18.07]It might do it, but I don't think so.
[72:19.49]It's a magical protection shield.
[72:26.00]Can't even do anything with B.
[72:35.62]I can't wanna do it.
[72:37.04]Gob.
[72:37.92]Summon a goblin.
[72:38.62]When am I gonna get this chance again?
[72:42.21]You pull a goblin tooth from your pack and drop it on the ground, casting your spell across it.
[72:46.33]The tooth erupts into a column of smoke and a moment later, a goblin warrior is standing in front of you.
[72:51.95]Order the goblin to cross the room.
[72:54.93]You direct the goblin to the far door and it sets off, charging across the chamber.
[72:59.71]As it reaches the crack, it seems to strike something and flies back, landing on its back, howling with frustration.
[73:08.09]Do it again.
[73:09.21]You order the goblin to run across the room once more, and this time, it attempts to make a path around the inner circumference of the tower.
[73:16.29]But at the same point, it strikes the invisible barrier and slithers to the ground.
[73:22.04]Attack the barrier, my creature!
[73:24.88]You order the goblin to assault the invisible barrier with its weapons, but nothing results apart from a tired goblin.
[73:30.92]But your creature can do no good.
[73:32.35]You wave the spell away.
[73:38.88]Howling with frustrating Howling with frustrating No, that's howling with frustration It's a typo It's alright, you tried Feel over the wall
[74:10.63]What the fuck am I even going to do here?
[74:13.24]A fireball?
[74:17.60]Counters duck.
[74:18.92]No.
[74:20.76]Heal disease.
[74:22.18]That's a different counter.
[74:26.90]It might be a grenade.
[74:34.59]I don't think it will be a grenade though, but what else could it be?
[74:38.10]It's not actually going to be Huff, is it?
[74:44.78]Okay, we can do Hau.
[74:46.08]Find safe passage.
[74:49.90]Consulting the constellations overhead, you bind the spell and a steady voice begins to speak to you.
[74:54.20]There is no way across the barrier that splits this tower in two, the voice declares.
[74:59.12]It is impervious to every physical assault.
[75:04.65]Yeah, so Pop is physical.
[75:08.77]Maybe it is Galehorn.
[75:11.69]I don't have any other options.
[75:14.89]It has to be Huff.
[75:16.01]It has to be.
[75:17.85]I can't do anything.
[75:19.09]All these are physical.
[75:20.05]It has to be Huff.
[75:21.53]Huff it is.
[75:22.31]Let's see if that works.
[75:28.74]Zap isn't physical?
[75:29.48]Well, Zap's not an option.
[75:31.25]The only non-physical thing I have is Hoth and Huff at the moment.
[75:35.39]And Hoth counters something else.
[75:37.69]So it's not going to counter the shield.
[75:39.43]I don't think you have more than one counter.
[75:43.17]I'm going to throw this and it's going to bounce off the wall and hit me in the fucking face.
[75:48.29]Is Hoth physical?
[75:49.05]I don't know.
[75:50.19]I don't think so.
[75:51.01]It's like a magical tornado.
[75:58.67]Hoth ain't going to work.
[75:59.56]Hoth's not going to work.
[76:00.26]I'm going to try Hoth.
[76:02.39]Boom.
[76:02.83]Huff.
[76:06.67]You bind the stars into a pattern around you, placing your Gerlhorn to your lips and playing a clear tone.
[76:11.51]A wind of terrific force builds up inside the tower, swirling about you so that your hair and cloak are whipped this way and that, dust zephyrs dart this way and that, dancing for joy, but the other side of the tower seems quite unaffected.
[76:26.39]After a while, the wind dies once more, leaving you quite breathless.
[76:32.92]I'm gonna touch the wall!
[76:33.90]I'm gonna throw a grenade and it's gonna bounce off the fucking wall!
[76:38.08]Don't you guys understand that?
[76:57.48]If I throw... And there's no rewinds.
[76:58.96]If I throw a grenade, it's gonna... Bounce off the wall and land at my feet and I'm gonna just explode.
[77:06.71]It said no physical thing could break this.
[77:08.93]What the fuck?
[77:11.19]Is it actually hot?
[77:14.41]It might have to be hot.
[77:15.44]Let me go through this one more time.
[77:19.56]It's not Goblin.
[77:21.22]I can't do anything with B. I don't even know why it's here.
[77:25.46]It's either Fireball...
[77:28.70]Or a grenade.
[77:30.80]Yeah, fireball or a grenade.
[77:32.76]Which one of those do?
[77:33.58]And one of them costs three stamina.
[77:38.49]Fireball.
[77:40.55]Cat, throw a fireball.
[77:45.67]Ayayay, you craft a spell creating a ball of flame between your hands.
[77:51.54]Throw a fireball across the tower.
[77:55.05]You toss the fireball across the tower as it reaches the invisible wall.
[77:57.71]It splashes, sending fire outwards in all directions.
[78:01.99]For a moment, the flames seem to define a flat surface in the air, and then the effect is gone as the flames burn away and the tower is dark again.
[78:17.91]This is not going to go well.
[78:18.77]Wait, what?
[78:19.95]What are you guys talking about?
[78:28.80]Bone?
[78:29.52]A bone wall?
[78:32.29]Wait, what?
[78:35.35]But, alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[78:38.17]I didn't listen to chat.
[78:40.19]I looked over at chat, like, two minutes ago, and I saw a heart a hundred fucking times.
[78:48.02]I saw a heart, like, at least a hundred fucking times.
[78:51.78]It said no physical thing.
[78:53.60]Whip a grenade against the fucking... Let's go!
[78:55.22]Oh, great!
[79:03.28]You know what?
[79:04.26]I blame this motherfucker right here.
[79:06.86]Let's look.
[79:08.59]What did Throff say?
[79:10.25]I want you to read it.
[79:15.57]There is no way across the barrier that splits this tower in two, the voice declares.
[79:19.24]It is impervious to every physical assault.
[79:23.60]An explosion is pretty fucking physical.
[79:27.31]Throwing an explosion, a bomb, into a wall is physical.
[79:32.21]It's physical.
[79:33.03]Throff lied to me.
[79:34.95]Worse than Lorag.
[79:40.14]Excuse me for listening to my inner spirit.
[79:46.90]Pop is magic?
[79:48.56]What?
[79:49.94]You take a pebble and you cast a spell at it and it turns into a grenade.
[80:01.64]That's physical.
[80:03.50]So you're telling me that hot is not physical?
[80:07.06]Oh, no, you're telling me hot is physical?
[80:10.82]What are you guys talking about?
[80:13.59]Pop is... They're all spells.
[80:15.25]Pop is a spell.
[80:16.25]These are all spells.
[80:18.93]I'm a goddamn magician, for crying out loud.
[80:24.72]There, we got the counter.
[80:25.58]Good.
[80:27.88]A magic grenade.
[80:31.93]angrily sips coffee.
[80:33.11]Yep.
[80:34.25]I am.
[80:36.43]Wait, someone just wrote in all capitals, just go.
[80:38.65]I'm going to look for the crack.
[80:42.14]Let's go.
[80:44.04]You look across the floor for any trace of the crack, but it has disappeared entirely, leaving nothing behind.
[80:48.74]But if you're going to cross, you should do so quickly.
[80:51.88]You can turn back or cross the far door.
[80:53.42]Go to the far door.
[80:54.68]That's a long bridge.
[80:58.25]Sorcerer.
[81:00.61]Here's a ghost rock.
[81:03.45]This is important.
[81:04.15]This is important.
[81:05.39]She has to go.
[81:06.15]She has to go.
[81:06.95]Jeez.
[81:08.83]Come on.
[81:09.21]Give me a little bit of respect here.
[81:13.89]Pop chooses to not identify as neither physical nor magical.
[81:17.93]I see it as a grenade.
[81:19.89]I see it as an explosion.
[81:20.87]I don't care if it's a magical explosion.
[81:22.45]It still explodes.
[81:23.67]What is it exploding?
[81:24.69]It's exploding the rock.
[81:25.87]You're magically making this.
[81:27.39]You're weaving an enchantment around a pebble, which is a rock by scientific definition.
[81:35.02]It expands and blasts pebble, a larger exploding pebble, which is a rock, which you've determined that, into the wall.
[81:50.89]Alright, let's go.
[81:56.57]Pop is the counter spell.
[81:57.79]I know, I'm just being a fucking idiot.
[82:00.43]Feed Otto.
[82:01.09]He's right here.
[82:01.49]He's fine.
[82:02.65]Hey, dog.
[82:03.78]Are you wagging your tail?
[82:11.04]You see the crack shiver back into place as you leave.
[82:13.56]The wall is back up.
[82:14.42]I'm not going back that way again.
[82:16.84]You make your way across a stone walkway, arching high into the air above the swirling waters that pool below, until you reach the next curious tower.
[82:24.60]As the sun climbs the sky, the winds rise.
[82:27.36]As you enter the tower, five other figures step in from identical-looking doors placed evenly around the walls.
[82:37.45]Hi, guys!
[82:39.41]You call out a greeting to the strangers.
[82:41.39]One replies.
[82:42.20]Another hurries across the room to the opposite door, while the rest stay put, looking this way and that.
[82:50.70]Okay, this is obviously just a bunch of me's.
[82:54.90]This is definitely the six spell.
[82:58.14]So what count is six?
[83:02.97]Let's make sure I'm correct here.
[83:04.97]You watch the newcomers from the safety of the doorway and mostly they do the same.
[83:08.65]But one rushes quickly across the room and another lifts his hand and calls out a greeting.
[83:17.64]Okay, I just walked into a room of dumb NPCs.
[83:25.61]Let's see what our options here are.
[83:31.67]What is the count of the sixth?
[83:32.85]Don't just throw a fucking grenade in the room.
[83:35.32]It's a magic grenade.
[83:36.52]It won't kill him.
[83:41.66]That was very childish.
[83:43.42]Sorry.
[83:45.27]Uh... Kin?
[83:47.53]Summon replica creatures?
[83:50.39]Should I summon more of them?
[83:54.65]Can I do six?
[83:57.57]Ooh, sap.
[83:59.03]Sap.
[83:59.31]Sap.
[84:04.58]Sun, create light.
[84:07.66]Hehehehe.
[84:12.37]I'm gonna assume... Wait a minute, what about Jig?
[84:15.77]No, this is Gak?
[84:17.07]Cause fear?
[84:19.95]Just have 12 people running around?
[84:21.48]No, that's gonna be so confusing.
[84:25.76]I'm gonna forget who I am.
[84:26.96]There's always Zap.
[84:31.44]Counter Zen.
[84:33.36]I already know the counter, what that is, but I... No one's Zenning right now.
[84:36.68]They're always running around talking to each other.
[84:39.57]Just a room full of Fallout NPCs.
[84:42.93]Hey.
[84:43.49]Howdy.
[84:44.29]I'm gonna walk this way.
[84:45.65]Hi.
[84:46.97]Hi there.
[84:48.22]Excuse you.
[84:57.94]Sap actually might be not a bad idea.
[85:05.50]I'm not gonna have any stamina, dudes.
[85:11.11]They could just cause depression.
[85:12.81]I'm doing it.
[85:16.46]You wind the constellation into alignment around you and you see another of the figures start to slump and look glum.
[85:22.98]Several of the other figures in the room have begun crafting spells and a moment later everything goes crazy.
[85:28.53]Lightning bolts fire from one finger at another who is wearing a black face mask.
[85:32.95]Blinding light comes from the hands of one who stands opposite.
[85:35.99]One disappears completely.
[85:38.48]We're all like cast expelled order order everybody's cut the shit you call out for order But the figures are too busy with their own squabbles one has fallen to the floor in sobbing despair Another has blown himself up with a pebble you You hurry from the insanity of the room just as one of the fingers tosses a glowing pebble at your feet which explodes on the ground
[86:06.44]Sending stone fragments in all directions.
[86:09.42]You escape without serious injury.
[86:11.39]Okay.
[86:13.81]Everybody just did the spell they were gonna do.
[86:15.95]That's fucking awesome.
[86:23.39]Oh my god.
[86:24.05]Oh, okay.
[86:24.79]I gotta go back this way?
[86:25.89]Oh, shit.
[86:33.93]Well, I guess that was it.
[86:36.55]Wait a minute!
[86:36.91]Wait a minute!
[86:38.33]Okay, no.
[86:39.41]I just had to... I was almost shit my pants there.
[86:41.87]Turn back.
[86:42.21]Okay, can we try this again?
[86:43.88]Let's try it again.
[86:47.26]Hold on.
[86:50.30]Okay, they all step inside.
[86:53.88]Cast a spell.
[86:58.18]Do I have, um...
[87:03.81]God, do I dare just summon 12 people?
[87:08.13]This is gonna be insane.
[87:10.85]First of all, I'm gonna... Yeah, I have one stamina.
[87:13.09]Throth, be useful for once.
[87:14.45]Yeah, I'm gonna summon 12 people.
[87:19.51]Let's just see what happens.
[87:25.21]Kin.
[87:26.67]Doesn't cost any stamina.
[87:27.53]Summon replica creatures.
[87:28.51]Let's just get 12 people in this room.
[87:30.83]Holy shit, test the counter!
[87:31.98]Ha ha ha ha!
[87:34.11]You cast the enchantment holding up the mirror which starts to glow and flash, but then nothing more happens.
[87:39.59]A moment later, you realize all the other figures in the room have vanished.
[87:43.70]A counterspell then.
[87:45.04]So the magic of self-duplication counters the pattern of mirroring.
[87:49.92]There we go.
[87:51.76]Look around.
[87:53.70]The tower is not quite empty.
[87:54.76]The four illusory doors have disappeared as well, leaving just the one you came in by and one opposite.
[88:00.97]There's nothing else to do here.
[88:03.25]And we can go to the last tower in the corner.
[88:06.76]Yeah.
[88:10.41]You move along the next walkway to the tower beyond.
[88:12.91]This chamber is empty save for a few crates stacked against one wall.
[88:16.67]Thick dust covers the floor with no footprints visible.
[88:20.80]A storeroom.
[88:23.66]Nothing is as it seems with these towers.
[88:28.96]Look around.
[88:31.65]You step into the room, kicking up a small cloud of dust as you walk.
[88:35.77]The air inside is shimmering.
[88:37.67]Then suddenly, you are blinded by a dazzling glare.
[88:43.73]Oh, Jesus.
[88:45.49]Shield my eyes or stare into the light?
[88:47.27]I'm gonna shield my eyes.
[88:51.63]You shield your eyes, fearing attack, but instead a calm voice declares, Do not fear me.
[88:57.81]You have nothing to fear.
[88:59.63]You are welcome.
[89:01.51]The voice is beautiful, calm, familiar.
[89:05.85]Life uplifting.
[89:07.88]My friend, surely you know me.
[89:10.88]And then you know her voice, and you fall to your knees.
[89:14.22]It's Libra!
[89:16.76]Libra!
[89:18.30]Yes, I am Libra.
[89:19.94]I have come again to help you, but at great risk.
[89:22.62]We must speak quickly, and then you must go.
[89:33.23]Wait a second.
[89:35.52]Wait a second.
[89:39.33]Wait a second.
[89:44.03]What the fuck is she doing here?
[89:47.43]What are you doing in here?
[89:54.87]This is one of these fucked up towers.
[89:57.23]She ain't here to save me.
[90:00.19]What's the counter to like a god?
[90:03.49]Or a fake god?
[90:06.39]Ooh, wait just a minute, wait just a minute.
[90:09.67]No, that's stupidity.
[90:11.53]Count as kid.
[90:12.67]Wait a minute, wait a minute!
[90:15.15]Kid is the illusion.
[90:16.61]Ooh!
[90:21.65]Kid is illusion of worship, right?
[90:25.06]Damn.
[90:26.18]I almost fell for that.
[90:28.20]I was almost about to get killed by a fucking creature.
[90:33.68]Gee, I can't even get in here.
[90:35.94]No, it's God.
[90:36.52]Okay, God.
[90:37.54]What counters God?
[90:42.16]What counters God?
[90:47.36]Caused sleepiness?
[90:53.14]Spellbook, spellbook, spellbook.
[90:54.64]It doesn't say it in the spellbook.
[90:55.70]I have to find it.
[90:59.46]So what counters God?
[91:02.32]What would counter God?
[91:04.56]Zap!
[91:05.34]I almost just did it as a joke, and I would have been so mad at myself.
[91:16.87]Duh, no.
[91:22.05]S... Zap.
[91:24.09]Wait a second here.
[91:24.91]Hold on.
[91:25.43]Like, depression?
[91:27.09]Like, worship and depression.
[91:33.74]Am I right there?
[91:35.87]Like, oh, I love you so much.
[91:37.19]Oh, I hate myself.
[91:38.29]Right?
[91:38.63]Like... That would be logical to me.
[91:51.04]Nap.
[91:51.46]Cause sleepiness.
[91:57.84]Would that counter... Worship?
[92:00.87]Worship?
[92:13.73]Let me see if she likes the name.
[92:15.83]Surely you know me.
[92:18.27]Libra, yeah right.
[92:22.37]Zap is the new Zap.
[92:25.31]Check H. Illogical, illogical.
[92:33.78]How no it's definitely wait a minute hold on how Wouldn't that be like oh think logically and think don't like fall for illusions think logically how?
[92:44.43]You can't worship if you are asleep She's giving you hope sap would take that away.
[92:51.21]That's what I was saying Technically these are both correct
[93:02.22]If you're asleep, you can't worship something.
[93:05.20]But sapping would take the hope of religion and worship away from you.
[93:18.39]Alright, I'm gonna... Here we go.
[93:21.51]It's gonna be how, sap, or nap.
[93:25.07]I literally throw the dice because it could be really any of them.
[93:28.37]I'm gonna do a pull.
[93:35.21]Sap.
[93:36.91]Nap.
[93:38.67]Or... How.
[93:42.31]I'll put Dim on there, too.
[93:43.75]Just cause, uh... But no, that kid is... Is it an illusion?
[93:48.77]I have no fucking idea.
[93:49.84]I'm gonna put Dim on the list, too.
[93:52.40]Here you go.
[93:56.82]Go for it.
[93:59.28]My fate is in your hands.
[94:03.98]Yeah.
[94:07.99]Sense danger, but I... It's definitely danger.
[94:11.41]We're inside one of these houses.
[94:14.58]These houses are... They're not good.
[94:25.11]Looks like Sap and Dim are currently winning.
[94:28.83]If it was me, just playing by myself, I would have picked Sap.
[94:32.89]That's what I would have done.
[94:39.37]Dim.
[94:40.15]Dim.
[94:40.57]I voted how.
[94:43.81]Alright, 10 seconds.
[94:46.65]10 seconds.
[94:51.51]Sap could go both ways, good or bad.
[94:58.38]But it's about a counter.
[94:59.20]It's not about sensing danger, it's about a counter spell.
[95:00.86]That's true.
[95:07.09]Sap.
[95:08.99]Draw your blade.
[95:10.49]Why not gob?
[95:13.45]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, the people have spoken.
[95:15.25]We're going to sap.
[95:19.46]Sap and dim and nap and how.
[95:23.24]Time to sap.
[95:24.94]I have a feeling this is going to... I feel like this is going to work.
[95:28.80]Cause depression.
[95:32.04]Sap.
[95:32.26]Sap.
[95:35.57]Looking to the constellations above, you craft a spell.
[95:38.37]The goddess seems to slump, and a moment later she is looking utterly dejected.
[95:50.84]Uh, okay, I got it.
[95:53.16]Okay, wait a minute, hold on, is this really Libra?
[95:57.70]I don't think it was Sap.
[95:58.92]Uh, should I cancel the spell?
[96:05.57]I think I'm gonna cancel it.
[96:06.51]I'm gonna cancel it.
[96:07.65]I didn't mean to cancel it.
[96:12.00]You take pity on the goddess and quickly wave the spell away, though it is surprising it worked at all.
[96:16.04]Okay, I'm sorry.
[96:16.80]I didn't mean to.
[96:17.34]Should I speak?
[96:23.20]Why would she be here?
[96:25.33]Are we gonna do dim?
[96:28.77]Dim or nap?
[96:33.29]It would have countered immediately.
[96:35.50]Am I in too deep here?
[96:38.50]What, dim?
[96:42.04]Caused stupidity.
[96:44.82]Counters kid.
[96:48.24]But isn't kid... Hold on a second.
[96:50.66]Is this... I want to just look up.
[96:53.30]I want to see exactly what kid says.
[96:58.61]Kid, kid, kid, kid, kid.
[97:01.34]Where are you?
[97:02.58]No, that was kin.
[97:05.16]Kin.
[97:05.54]Okay, kid.
[97:08.68]Wait, nap.
[97:23.43]Effective only against living creatures, this spell causes them to quickly fall asleep.
[97:27.45]It is used in conjunction with a brass pendulum.
[97:29.20]The spell concentrates the creature's attention on the pendulum.
[97:33.20]Okay.
[97:40.12]Kid.
[97:41.43]It's going to be Dim.
[97:41.93]We're going to go Dim.
[97:42.45]Is this worship or is this illusion?
[97:43.37]I don't know.
[97:43.79]We're going to go Dim.
[98:14.69]Sap was the thing?
[98:19.83]But what if it's not an illusion?
[98:21.29]But what if it is?
[98:21.83]I don't know.
[98:22.15]We're gonna do it.
[98:22.51]We'll go for it.
[98:22.95]We'll try it.
[98:23.43]We'll try Dim.
[98:25.03]D.I.M.
[98:26.42]Encounters Kid.
[98:28.18]Stupidity.
[98:31.44]You weave the starlight into your design around you, causing Libra to babble incoherently for a minute.
[98:36.62]It cheers you a little, although surely a goddess would be immune to such magic.
[98:45.67]Huh?
[98:47.93]So it's not an illusion.
[98:51.41]So this is not an illusion.
[98:55.94]But it... Should I just talk to her?
[99:02.58]I'm like torturing this poor goddess.
[99:07.72]Let's do nap.
[99:08.44]Let's do nap.
[99:09.18]Let's put her to sleep.
[99:12.04]There's no fucking way that the Goddess of Libra is in one of the Archmage's shitty burnt down towers.
[99:18.01]There's no way.
[99:21.93]Nap?
[99:22.19]We're gonna do nap.
[99:25.22]Cause sleepiness.
[99:26.30]Okay, I made her stupid.
[99:28.30]I made her depressed.
[99:29.48]And now I'm gonna make her go to sleep.
[99:35.08]Alright, hold on.
[99:36.64]You weave the spell, bringing out the pendulum, but as you swing it, the atmosphere of the room warps.
[99:41.38]There is no effect on Libra at first, but then the light is blurred away until it is gone.
[99:46.08]A counterspell then.
[99:47.42]So the spell of sleep is countered by that of worship.
[99:50.85]The nap and god counterspell has been recorded in your spellbook.
[99:54.37]The light vanishes, revealing a goblin standing in the middle of the room.
[99:58.29]He is wearing a long blonde wig.
[100:00.75]He raises his hands.
[100:02.85]This is not what it looks like.
[100:15.72]I can see that now.
[100:17.75]The goblin... Who are you?
[100:26.29]The goblin waves his arms.
[100:28.54]Do you not recognize the true form of Lisa?
[100:31.66]I meant Libra.
[100:33.08]Gaze upon the wonder of your goddess.
[100:37.30]Alright then, forget it.
[100:41.15]Why did you try to trick me?
[100:43.71]Why do you think?
[100:45.07]You run in sword waggling and I've got a big wig to defend myself with?
[100:49.67]I didn't think you'd actually believe me.
[100:54.53]Step towards the goblin.
[100:56.68]You step towards the goblin and he cringes.
[100:59.39]I see this isn't working.
[101:02.07]I ran from the other tower.
[101:03.93]The goblin holds the wig up helplessly.
[101:05.83]And don't ask me where I got this from.
[101:10.25]Tinder date.
[101:13.65]Speak to the goblin.
[101:15.61]The goblin adjusts his wig.
[101:17.71]Look, I'm as upset about this as you are.
[101:24.03]Tell me what you know of this place.
[101:26.58]I know little.
[101:28.76]Already ducking to avoid a blow?
[101:30.52]What did I swing at him?
[101:32.46]I escaped from the tower with all the other goblins in it.
[101:35.20]That's a horrible place.
[101:36.36]Don't go there.
[101:37.76]Then I made it through the other towers.
[101:39.60]The creature me.
[101:40.72]I'm shuddering.
[101:41.46]This place is terrible.
[101:45.26]Why are you doing this?
[101:47.12]I'm hiding.
[101:48.28]You charged in the air and then started bowing.
[101:51.42]I just played along.
[101:55.01]And why are you wearing a wig?
[101:57.79]Believe it or not, I was trying to hide underneath it.
[102:01.30]What it's doing here, I can honestly say I have no idea, and I don't want to know.
[102:07.06]Well, now that we've bonded so well, I assume you'll be leaving peacefully?
[102:11.62]He has desperation on his face.
[102:15.23]Come with me.
[102:18.43]You suggest.
[102:19.27]The goblin peers at you.
[102:21.45]You do realize I'm not your lemur god, or whatever it was.
[102:28.06]Of course I do.
[102:30.40]Then I'm not going anywhere with you.
[102:32.32]I'm not dragging myself after you just so you can eat me when you first get hungry.
[102:36.86]He sits down sharply, cross-legged on the floor.
[102:41.69]Threaten.
[102:42.79]You threaten to skewer the goblin, and he shrinks away.
[102:45.83]Without the spell around him, he is quite powerless.
[102:49.41]You really want me along?
[102:52.67]Well, I'm not coming, I'm not.
[102:54.98]He cowers, expecting the worst.
[103:13.80]Well, you guys decide.
[103:21.91]You guys decide.
[103:25.87]Because last time I was going to kill somebody, everybody freaked out.
[103:29.78]And it turned out to be like one of my best friends.
[103:32.56]So, good luck.
[103:41.50]What am I doing to the fake goblin goddess princess?
[103:46.42]Spare, spare.
[103:48.64]Do I get a little friend?
[103:49.44]Will he come with me?
[103:51.80]Can I turn him into a tooth?
[104:02.47]He does have a magical item.
[104:03.61]That's right.
[104:03.93]He does have a very powerful relic of some way.
[104:11.54]You need that jewel.
[104:15.40]Let the little rascal live.
[104:22.73]Alright.
[104:23.73]This one is a landslide.
[104:31.45]We're sparing him.
[104:33.03]Five seconds, four, three, two, one.
[104:34.60]This election is over.
[104:35.90]We are sparing the goblin.
[104:38.61]Thank you for voting, I appreciate it.
[104:40.53]Let's get back to business.
[104:41.93]Spare the goblin.
[104:45.00]You decide to spare the creature who falls over himself in thanks.
[104:48.94]You are a kind adventurer.
[104:50.60]All those rumors are probably false.
[104:52.76]I have nothing to give you in thanks, unless... Would you like my wig?
[104:57.86]He removes it and offers it to you.
[105:00.15]It smells awful.
[105:03.89]Do I take this wig?
[105:07.30]What if this is like a trick?
[105:08.38]What if he's gonna, like, hypnotize me with it?
[105:14.47]Yeah, it's a wig.
[105:15.21]Oh, we're gonna put a wig on?
[105:16.21]Ah, take it.
[105:23.87]Ugh, take it.
[105:25.56]Refuse it.
[105:26.04]Oh, do I do an... Take it.
[105:29.38]Accept the wig.
[105:31.16]You accept the wig and put it on.
[105:33.48]It does little for your appearance.
[105:37.93]I'm just wearing a wig.
[105:39.63]Okay.
[105:40.39]Search the room.
[105:42.15]You search the room, but find nothing.
[105:43.85]It is truly empty.
[105:45.81]I sometimes see a rat run through, but nothing else.
[105:50.09]You leave the pitiful creature behind without another word.
[105:55.45]Okay.
[105:58.03]Okie dokie.
[105:59.93]Just go.
[106:00.95]I did not go on this one.
[106:04.25]I did not go on... We're gonna go all the way to the top.
[106:06.90]All the way up.
[106:09.64]The path passes the base of another tower set into the side of the central mountain peak itself, but even the peak of Mampang is dwarfed by the endless mountains of Upper Xamen, stretching away northwards like a turbulent gray ocean.
[106:22.72]Look at the mountains.
[106:24.54]You pause, taking in the endless Vista.
[106:26.48]These lands are cruel and cold, a part of the world not made for humans.
[106:30.46]But still they are inhabited by low creatures, by birds, by a few strange sapient reptiles.
[106:38.02]Sapient reptiles.
[106:38.94]They've been sapped.
[106:40.40]Nowhere in the old world is truly empty except perhaps these towers through which you now walk.
[106:46.98]The tower.
[106:50.93]The sun begins to dip heading towards the horizon.
[106:53.25]You approach the next weird tower, wondering what you will find this time.
[106:58.14]The interior of the tower is quite empty except for a brass sphere in the center, capped with black cloth.
[107:09.88]Okay.
[107:11.66]Brass sphere in the center.
[107:12.68]What is brass spheres for?
[107:14.18]Zen, right?
[107:15.82]Look at the sphere.
[107:17.37]The sphere rotates slowly, smoothly on some invisible gimbal.
[107:20.57]Perhaps it is lightly floating.
[107:24.57]Yeah, this is the Zen spell.
[107:25.98]What counter is Zen?
[107:28.16]Look at the cloth.
[107:29.88]The black cloth is draped over the top of the gently rotating sphere.
[107:33.06]There is nothing remarkable about it.
[107:37.56]This is Zen.
[107:38.97]It's hovering, it's hovering.
[107:40.49]What's the counter to Zen?
[107:42.11]We'll find it.
[107:45.43]Right off the bat, I'm going to probably say... Resurrect the dead, no.
[107:52.94]Raz, sharpened blade.
[107:54.24]That's definitely not it.
[107:58.58]Oh, wait a minute!
[107:59.11]Wait a minute!
[107:59.51]Wait a minute!
[107:59.93]It is Zap!
[108:00.79]It's Zap!
[108:05.03]Oh, we get to actually cast Zap.
[108:06.71]Is it going to kill me?
[108:09.57]Four stamina.
[108:11.12]No Throth.
[108:12.82]This is... Ugh.
[108:16.77]It's fucking Zap, but I'm gonna die.
[108:21.35]Can I afford to cast this right now?
[108:24.21]I'm not so sure I can.
[108:27.09]I'm gonna eat.
[108:30.19]Because I could die here.
[108:34.41]So this is Zen, absolutely.
[108:35.61]It's a floating medallion.
[108:38.43]Let's Zap the shit out of this thing.
[108:42.03]Z-A-P.
[108:43.54]This one was E-A-S-Y.
[108:46.52]You know what I'm saying?
[108:49.48]Consulting the stars, you bind the magic building with a formidable electric force in your hand.
[108:54.17]Fire it at the spear.
[108:55.97]You unleash the spear.
[108:59.69]Did I just say spear?
[109:01.65]Why did I say spear?
[109:03.78]sphere you unleash the bolt of the sphere which explodes in a violent plume of twisted metal for a moment you seem to see a face of bone spiraling upwards into the air but then it's turned to ash you turn and head quickly back out of the broken tower what that had to have been zen
[109:35.54]What?
[109:43.19]Well, I mean, I already know.
[109:47.89]The wind picks up the evening.
[109:48.89]Will it be night soon?
[109:49.63]You follow the path and make your way into the tower once again.
[109:51.47]What is this place?
[109:52.07]Why was it built?
[109:53.23]The brass spear is still here, or the wreckage of it is.
[110:02.12]It was a floating brass medallion.
[110:04.24]That's zen.
[110:07.64]Whatever, I'm fine.
[110:09.12]Wait a minute.
[110:09.62]Isn't this the goblin tower?
[110:16.08]Is he still in here?
[110:16.88]I wonder.
[110:20.15]The sun lowers towards the horizon.
[110:21.75]Soon it will be dark once more.
[110:22.73]You enter the next tower uncertainly.
[110:24.59]You return to the tower where the goblin attempted to trick you.
[110:27.69]The goblin remains.
[110:28.63]Most likely he has nowhere else to go.
[110:31.37]You again.
[110:32.59]Have you not humiliated me enough?
[110:35.44]You leave the pitiful creature.
[110:37.47]This is the one I want to go into.
[110:44.33]The sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky.
[110:46.65]You approach the next tower.
[110:48.19]A gloomy silence descends.
[110:50.45]The outside of the tower is overgrown and inside the foliage is thicker still.
[110:54.22]The floor and walls are thick with plants and the plants themselves are dripping with overripe berries.
[111:00.54]Purple liquid pools across the stone and a purple fog rises up from it.
[111:07.00]Uh-oh.
[111:08.83]I can't rewind.
[111:09.61]There's no... Literally no rewinds are allowed.
[111:11.79]That's right.
[111:15.03]Smell the fog?
[111:16.03]I don't think that's a great idea.
[111:21.68]Although it could be blimbleberries.
[111:23.78]It could be bimbleberries.
[111:27.42]I can't even cast a spell yet, so... Try to smell it.
[111:32.61]Smell it.
[111:34.79]You sniff the fog tentatively.
[111:36.61]The smell is overtly sweet, almost rotten.
[111:38.76]Makes you gag slightly.
[111:41.92]Look for doors.
[111:44.78]Peering across the miniature jungle and through the haze, you make out another door across the room.
[111:51.62]Across the room.
[111:54.13]You take a few steps further into the tower.
[111:55.95]Every footstep crushes plants and berries underfoot.
[111:59.21]Standing your heels and sending up new clouds of purple fog...
[112:03.79]The sweet smell grows more cloying as you go.
[112:06.89]The plants get deeper further in.
[112:12.11]Keep going.
[112:14.91]You keep on through the thickening foliage.
[112:17.32]Bushes grow up from cracks in the stone on all sides and hang down in vines and creepers from the ceiling.
[112:23.18]Dim light gently fills the room that would hardly seems enough for so much growth.
[112:28.38]You're now in the middle of the tower where the purple fog is at its thickest.
[112:36.78]Should I pick some berries?
[112:40.16]You pick a berry from the bush.
[112:41.66]It is bright purple and leaves a dark blue stain on your fingertips.
[112:45.50]This is definitely blimble berries.
[112:47.96]Eat it.
[112:50.44]You taste it, but it's hardly bitter and sour, so you spit it quickly out once more.
[112:56.81]What is this shit?
[113:03.05]Ooh, wait a minute.
[113:04.11]This is, um...
[113:08.18]is the smelly one right like the gross one the rotten one let's look at the bush you lean down and look through the bushes to the stone floor below the plants seem to be growing in little or no soil sustained by some magic your fingers now move across a scratch in the ground uh oh look at the scratch mark
[113:32.73]The mark is a single scratched line, but clearly carved.
[113:36.13]There is nothing else in the stone nearby.
[113:39.39]Smell the fog.
[113:40.75]Keep moving.
[113:42.73]You stamp and squelch to the far side of the tower.
[113:45.90]Nothing untowered occurs.
[113:47.38]The bushes thin out once more near the doors and fresh air beckons.
[113:50.86]I found a new clue.
[113:54.94]What the fuck is the clue?
[113:57.73]Glyph 1.
[113:59.91]You found a Glyph 1 in the Tower of Berries.
[114:02.49]Glyph 2.
[114:04.11]You found a Glyph 2 in the Tower of Statues.
[114:10.43]What?
[114:10.59]How do you counter the rotten berries?
[114:14.17]Interesting.
[114:21.40]Thank you, Redheadrama.
[114:22.54]Jerma, you seem like the kind of guy who has a great relationship with his mother.
[114:26.85]Love you.
[114:27.27]Well, Redheadorama, that is true.
[114:29.55]I have a wonderful relationship with both of my parents.
[114:32.51]Especially my mom.
[114:34.34]Oh, God!
[114:35.02]I love my mom.
[114:40.66]I just, like, punched the mic again.
[114:50.50]Isn't this the scary tower with the goblins in it?
[115:00.05]I think this is the Goblin Tower, right?
[115:03.87]You cross the waters and push your way inside the next tower boldly.
[115:06.37]The tower contains a large circular room.
[115:09.19]A few steps in, however, you begin to lose your bearings.
[115:12.44]Look around.
[115:15.44]Though the tower itself is a simple, clear space, there is something disorienting about it.
[115:19.80]Perhaps it is because there are so many doors, between 20 and 30, at a rough guess.
[115:25.36]Worryingly, in the middle of the floor lies a skeleton.
[115:39.32]30 doors?
[115:40.74]Why are there so many doors?
[115:44.30]Ooh, 30 doors, you say?
[115:47.20]Did you say 30 doors?
[115:49.38]Well, by golly.
[115:51.90]Good thing I have Dopp.
[115:56.77]You turn the stars and shape around you.
[115:58.13]A few doors fly open at random.
[116:00.01]You catch glimpses of hills, fields, dark chambers, and forgotten halls.
[116:03.41]A snatch of music floats in along with a murmur of whispered voices.
[116:07.71]Then the door slams shut.
[116:10.29]Shit.
[116:13.89]Resurrect the skeleton?
[116:16.29]I don't have holy water.
[116:23.22]R-E-S.
[116:25.72]I can't resurrect him.
[116:34.14]Zip.
[116:36.46]Uh...
[116:40.88]How?
[116:42.04]Safe passage.
[116:44.84]I'm gonna die.
[116:51.55]You craft the enchantment.
[116:52.73]A calm voice speaks into your thoughts.
[116:54.67]There are many more doors here than appear.
[116:59.59]The voice informs you.
[117:00.89]In fact, all the doors are here.
[117:03.82]But I will lead you to an exit.
[117:06.70]With that, the room begins to move into an alignment you can understand.
[117:09.54]The effect is quite giddy.
[117:14.70]I gotta get out of here.
[117:16.78]Leave the cha- I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[117:20.48]With the aid of the spell, you feel fairly confident of which door is which.
[117:23.43]Time to put it to the test.
[117:25.01]Get me out of that room.
[117:26.25]I have no idea what the fuck it is, and I have one stamina.
[117:31.69]Let's keep going.
[117:33.31]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[117:37.24]I didn't mean to fucking do- I'm dead.
[117:45.33]I'm dead from... Dead from... What's my fate?
[117:48.03]Dead from misclick.
[117:54.20]Great.
[117:57.16]That's great.
[118:01.12]Time to die.
[118:02.88]Look around!
[118:03.72]Oh, the skeleton!
[118:04.42]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[118:05.34]Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave.
[118:06.23]Make a move.
[118:09.23]All the doors.
[118:09.79]Pick a door.
[118:10.47]Look through my...
[118:14.28]Wait a minute, what if I rest?
[118:16.18]Rest a while.
[118:24.10]Okay.
[118:25.68]Alright, I like went to sleep in this place.
[118:28.43]And I'm gonna be alright.
[118:29.43]I'm gonna be okay.
[118:33.73]I'm gonna be fine.
[118:37.83]Okay, just pretend.
[118:39.85]Pretend I, uh...
[118:43.46]Hey, look at that.
[118:44.42]Just imagine I got extra stamina.
[118:49.93]Look at the south tower.
[118:53.61]I'm gonna sleep here.
[118:55.07]Just go to bed.
[118:58.61]The short hallway makes for good rest.
[118:59.99]Moving your pack, you try to settle despite the cold.
[119:01.51]You do not need to eat anymore today.
[119:02.83]Close your eyes.
[119:04.59]Oh no, time to dream again.
[119:08.22]The long night is restless with visions.
[119:11.27]You stand in a crowd of others, Analanders, fleeing a darkness gathering in the east.
[119:15.80]You are all struggling to get aboard a boat, but one by one people are turning to stone where they stand.
[119:21.34]And all the while you hear distant laughter from the east.
[119:28.87]Alright, two new clues.
[119:30.59]We got some new counterspells.
[119:35.23]Uh, look over the door.
[119:36.29]Open the door.
[119:36.87]What am I talking about?
[119:43.52]No, leave the door alone.
[119:44.34]I don't want to go in there.
[119:48.34]What are you fucking... I thought I was talking about this door!
[119:53.30]Oh my god, go in and rest!
[119:57.47]Look around.
[119:59.55]Rest a while.
[120:00.89]I can't rest a while.
[120:02.37]Oh my fucking god.
[120:07.25]I thought I was talking about that door, because I got...
[120:11.95]Jesus Christ.
[120:12.85]The wording fucked my brain up.
[120:16.95]Get me the fuck out of this.
[120:18.43]All these towers, they're all the same goddamn tower.
[120:22.53]Go this way.
[120:29.68]Actually, I'm kind of glad I did that.
[120:33.02]I'm very glad I did that because I didn't go to these two.
[120:38.18]The early morning sun makes the air glow.
[120:40.06]You enter the next tower.
[120:42.39]You venture into a room as black as a coal mine.
[120:45.03]There's no light at all.
[120:46.29]Even the sunshine at your back does not reach inside this space.
[120:49.93]As you step into the room, the door behind you slams shut.
[120:53.85]You are now in total darkness.
[120:58.04]Easy.
[120:59.18]That would be S-U-N.
[121:03.98]Easy.
[121:05.28]S-U-N.
[121:07.38]Create light sun jewel.
[121:08.82]Thank you.
[121:11.32]You cast a spell, and the sun jewel in your pack begins to pulse and throb with a brilliant blinding light.
[121:16.17]But the jewel's light does not brighten.
[121:17.71]Instead, the whole room clears, its terrible darkness lifting.
[121:22.21]A counterspell, then.
[121:23.65]So the enchantment of fogging matches the spell of sunlight.
[121:30.04]I just burped a little bit because somebody asked.
[121:32.40]The fog sun counterspell has been recorded in your spellbook.
[121:34.50]Cool.
[121:36.71]Got it.
[121:38.97]You look around an all-clear chamber, the room is perfectly well-lit, and you see it laid out with spikes and blades.
[121:45.57]In the center is a small wooden contraption with arms positioned to capture starlight.
[121:51.87]This, then, is a Grimalkin.
[121:53.47]You've heard of such things, but never seen one before.
[121:56.58]It is a machine of a kind, built and positioned where it can be channeling the force of a single spell.
[122:02.80]Grimalkins are hard to build, but can be devastatingly powerful.
[122:06.72]fucking destroy this thing.
[122:07.94]Because if I have to come back in here again, for any fucking reason ever again, I didn't do that last time.
[122:13.98]Remember the hot Grimalkin that kept appearing and I never got rid of it?
[122:18.92]Back in, um, Source 33?
[122:22.10]With a few blows, you manage to destroy the Grimalkin.
[122:24.16]The last wisps of lightless smoke disappear from the room.
[122:27.20]You pick your way carefully, but easily, through the now clear room.
[122:30.46]There are two doors from the chamber.
[122:35.30]So, we've been to all of these.
[122:41.29]I think we've been to these ones too.
[122:44.29]From my remembering, I just don't think we've been in this one.
[122:48.13]Let's find out.
[122:51.23]You continue over the next bridge to the strange tower beyond.
[122:53.79]The air moves a little around you, still icy but fresh.
[122:57.35]That's happened like five times.
[122:59.83]The room contains a large table surrounded by several chairs.
[123:06.09]Thank you for the burping.
[123:09.05]Enter.
[123:11.43]You approach the table only to pause as you notice a creature sitting so still you had not previously spotted them.
[123:17.43]They're fiddling with an assortment of tools and murmuring quietly.
[123:21.18]Moreover, the creature has two heads.
[123:23.10]Uh, greet it?
[123:31.99]You stride over to the creature offering a greeting.
[123:34.54]The creature's right head bobs in reply while the left breaks into a disturbingly wide smile.
[123:41.80]Welcome!
[123:43.38]You've come at just the right time.
[123:46.41]I was disagreeing about the nature of universals, weren't I?
[123:54.23]Universals?
[123:56.07]The left head nods while the right head shakes vigorously.
[123:59.24]Oh no, I mean particulars.
[124:01.76]There are no universals besides extension.
[124:05.73]I said universals because that's what I'm disagreeing about.
[124:11.37]Is extension not a substance?
[124:13.59]Start at the beginning.
[124:15.95]Good idea.
[124:17.19]Both heads then launch into an intricate, concurrent retelling of their debate.
[124:21.54]It is cordial enough, except whenever the left head mentions forms, the right one spits on the floor.
[124:27.99]At the end of it, you gain an appreciation of the issue.
[124:30.97]The right head sniffs.
[124:32.61]Why am I wasting my time on this?
[124:34.87]It is not as if this one can help solve this.
[124:37.91]Ignore me.
[124:38.89]Please, sit down.
[124:40.01]It's been so long since I had another mind to conserve with.
[124:43.27]Converse with.
[124:47.64]Oh, I'm going to sit at the table.
[124:50.42]You go to take a seat at the table, but something odd catches the corner of your eye, and you look over your shoulder.
[124:56.55]The door you came in by has vanished.
[124:59.51]The creature watches patiently, oblivious to any change.
[125:07.09]Where's the door?
[125:09.17]Door is a meaningless concept absent of a room, the right head says.
[125:14.41]So my question is nonsensical.
[125:16.94]No, no, no, that is wrong.
[125:18.32]The presence of a door creates a room.
[125:20.56]Otherwise it would just be a box.
[125:23.33]I am an idiot.
[125:24.83]If that were true, gated fields would be rooms.
[125:27.99]In the middle of the table is a candle of blood-red wax.
[125:34.50]What are these people talking about?
[125:37.62]But where is the door?
[125:40.70]I don't know what they're doing.
[125:43.10]What am I supposed to be countering here?
[125:49.37]Uh...
[125:53.26]Zip.
[126:00.54]Sense danger?
[126:03.60]Burn them.
[126:07.12]Doc?
[126:07.60]I don't know.
[126:08.42]How?
[126:09.18]How?
[126:09.46]Maybe no?
[126:12.41]Doc is heal disease.
[126:15.29]Don't have... The heal's hot.
[126:17.03]I don't have any potions.
[126:24.84]Why does he keep doing that shit?
[126:26.21]F... A... R... See the future!
[126:33.97]Or F... Is it F-I?
[126:36.09]Fix?
[126:37.79]Caused fixedness?
[126:47.34]Half of these spells I can't even do.
[126:51.70]I can't do dumb.
[126:57.07]I don't think I... Whatever the counter is for this, I don't think I have it.
[127:00.21]I don't have any of the items.
[127:04.63]I mean, I can see the future.
[127:06.95]I'm going to see the future and tell them what happens.
[127:11.75]You sit cross-legged on the ground and put your palms on the orb.
[127:14.29]Looking at the stars, you craft the magic and everything changes.
[127:17.27]You see an unfamiliar man standing in this very room.
[127:20.91]He reaches for one of the tools on the table, but is unable to lift it.
[127:25.19]He strains to pick it up, eventually giving up, panting with effort.
[127:30.37]The tool must be too heavy or perhaps stuck to the tabletop.
[127:42.29]What is that trying to tell me?
[127:43.13]Take the candle?
[127:45.69]Take the candle.
[127:47.05]You pick up the blood candle.
[127:48.14]The creature nods in passing.
[127:51.32]That was useful in a previous discussion.
[127:54.09]I were questioning if an inanimate object could be inherently evil.
[128:05.52]Shit.
[128:11.36]But don't, hold on.
[128:14.04]It's definitely, it has to be fixed.
[128:21.52]Staff of Oak Sapling.
[128:22.66]Where the hell was I supposed to get that?
[128:29.80]I'm gonna try how.
[128:33.18]I wonder if I can just get the hell out of here.
[128:36.68]Find safe path.
[128:37.34]Just get me out of here.
[128:41.12]You spin the starlight into a pattern around you, but the voice does not appear.
[128:45.35]Instead, the creature begins squabbling with itself again.
[128:52.56]Converse with the creature.
[128:54.42]You take a seat at the table and open your mouth, but are interrupted before you can speak.
[128:58.38]Finally, someone willing to be educated, the left head says, banging his fist on the table and making a pile of tools jump.
[129:07.06]Was that a comment about me?
[129:08.78]The right retorts.
[129:12.36]How do I leave?
[129:13.34]Uh, hey.
[129:21.02]Um, I...
[129:23.57]I don't know.
[129:24.05]I don't know what.
[129:24.61]What do I do?
[129:30.25]Wait, what?
[129:32.16]I would like to learn from you.
[129:36.02]Well, I have some thoughts regarding the persistence of objects, if you are interested.
[129:40.70]The left begins with pride.
[129:42.76]Only mildly objectionable.
[129:46.08]Please, don't go on.
[129:47.58]Go on.
[129:50.12]You are then subjected to a lengthy, torturous lecture that is extremely difficult to follow, but you feel as if you have learned quite a bit from listening.
[130:01.19]Do you know how to pass the Throbin Door?
[130:05.73]Do you know how to pass the Throbin Door, you ask?
[130:08.11]What?
[130:08.89]Oh, no, no, no.
[130:10.30]That is thoroughly practical.
[130:12.76]But there are principles.
[130:14.42]All locks must be unlockable to bear their status as locks, even magical ones.
[130:21.35]And the most powerful lock does not necessitate the most powerful key, the other adds.
[130:28.69]Consider the final lock, for instance, the spell of annulment.
[130:32.78]The most secret spell, the most impossible and yet easily inverted.
[130:37.32]Indeed.
[130:37.64]That is, learn the final spell, annulment.
[130:46.52]Well, thanks, psychos.
[130:50.62]What are you?
[130:53.45]How insulting.
[130:54.75]I are a scholar.
[130:58.11]But you have two heads.
[131:00.19]A trivelty.
[131:01.15]The real question is, how many minds?
[131:03.92]Fool, don't, moron.
[131:05.52]Minds are immaterial and so cannot be accounted.
[131:12.06]What is the counter for the fourth lock?
[131:15.74]Oh, no, no, no.
[131:16.31]That is most definitely applied.
[131:18.65]There is no theory in that.
[131:20.71]Wasn't that instructive?
[131:23.40]These guys are fucking freaking me out.
[131:25.25]I'm going to die.
[131:28.63]Where's the door?
[131:30.13]The two heads answer simultaneously.
[131:32.17]Why, over there, they both say, pointing in two different directions.
[131:36.32]Neither to your eyes presents a door.
[131:40.52]Oh, God.
[131:42.06]Look over the table.
[131:44.16]You cast your eyes over the table.
[131:45.43]Tools are scattered across it.
[131:48.42]Ah, that was a fascinating topic.
[131:51.04]I disagreed about the tool's relationship to its worker.
[131:53.80]If someone builds a chair, how much responsibility does the hammer have?
[132:00.25]But where do the tools come from?
[132:02.57]I do not understand, the right says.
[132:06.07]I needed them for an example in my argument.
[132:08.63]So they are here.
[132:11.77]right now consider a door you begin initiating a debate about the distinction between entering and leaving uh the door is surely two-sided but quite symmetrical so entering and leaving are purely in the eye of the observer but who is that the left head peers at you where are they you mean that's a good point isn't it
[132:35.02]It seems unsure.
[132:36.32]The right head frowns.
[132:37.68]Every door is built.
[132:39.12]Surely the building of a door constitutes an initial placement observation.
[132:46.33]But can one build an empty doorway?
[132:51.43]If it can be conceived, it can be built.
[132:53.81]But we conceive of much as negative space and must build the container.
[132:59.52]In the case of a doorway.
[133:02.30]Fucking hell.
[133:07.01]Let them argue!
[133:07.61]Ooh!
[133:10.27]You let them continue to argue, and a pair of doors begins to form and solidify in the walls of the room.
[133:15.21]Then you race for the exit, leaving the heads of the creature too busy arguing to notice.
[133:18.89]I did it.
[133:21.93]I actually got out.
[133:24.77]I had no idea what the fuck was going on in that room, but I got out.
[133:34.98]Okay, got it.
[133:38.70]I had trouble with that one.
[133:40.95]Alright.
[133:43.43]Move on.
[133:47.27]So we're back at this junction here.
[133:49.51]We've explored every tower except for... Which one have I not gone in?
[133:54.98]I went in these earlier.
[133:55.86]Let's just see.
[133:58.52]Make sure I'm not crazy.
[134:02.05]Wait, this one's different.
[134:04.49]A few clouds drift across the sky.
[134:05.86]You approach the next tower warily.
[134:07.44]This tower contains a single bare room.
[134:08.88]There's no furniture, but a rancid stench fills your nostrils.
[134:14.08]Search the room.
[134:16.41]Whoa, you search around, checking for traps or switches.
[134:19.51]The stench in the room is making your eyes spin.
[134:22.13]And then you take one step towards the center of the room, and then the floor disappears.
[134:27.51]Well... Look around.
[134:51.08]Looking around, you see you are in a wide pit with walls reaching far above your head.
[134:55.62]The pit is dark with edges in shadow.
[134:57.98]The smell is so powerful it is hard to concentrate.
[135:00.36]Tears are welling up in your eyes.
[135:02.68]There is a small bundle near the center of the pit, but before you can consider it too closely, something moves somewhere in the shadows.
[135:17.06]I'm going to climb the invest... shout.
[135:21.55]Who's there?
[135:22.07]You shout.
[135:23.39]A growl comes from the shadows and a large beast emerges.
[135:26.63]A skunk bear.
[135:28.89]The beast rears its thick striped tail quivering in razor claws displayed.
[135:34.47]A skunk bear is no match for you, however unappealing it may be.
[135:43.12]The monster roars and then two more walk into view.
[135:48.28]Oh, shit.
[135:49.64]The... Ah!
[135:52.25]The proximity of the beast causes the smell to worsen.
[135:55.59]Your head swims and limbs droop.
[136:00.61]Okay.
[136:01.41]What do I do?
[136:10.16]Law would work down here.
[136:11.96]Control non-intelligent creatures that dump skunk bears.
[136:17.98]Zen would hover... No, that's hovering.
[136:20.18]That's not... Can I... Ugh.
[136:23.24]I can talk, yap, I can speak.
[136:24.84]I think I'm gonna do Law.
[136:29.19]Make them eat each other.
[136:33.91]I mean, Zen is... Huff.
[136:42.59]Be like a banana and Zen out.
[136:45.59]Yeah, I feel like that's probably the safest bet is Zen and just get the hell out of here.
[136:53.05]talk to them.
[136:54.71]Yeah, I'm Zenit.
[136:55.55]I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[136:56.51]I'm too low on stamina to fuck this over.
[137:01.30]Alright, you medallion, because the glow as you rise gently into the air, you float up and out of the pit, landing safely on the edge.
[137:07.68]The skunk bears roar with primal fury.
[137:10.68]Your weight returns and you settle gradually back down to the ground.
[137:15.32]Look down at the pit.
[137:16.69]Hurl myself into the pit of skunk bears.
[137:19.99]Edge around the pit.
[137:23.31]Why is this even an option?
[137:26.67]Why is this an option?
[137:28.23]I just got out.
[137:29.03]Why would I want to do that?
[137:29.87]I don't want to do that.
[137:34.26]No, no.
[137:35.34]Everyone's telling me to do that again.
[137:36.54]I'm not doing that.
[137:37.52]That's a terrible idea.
[137:39.00]Hurl myself into the pit of skunk bears.
[137:42.36]You ready yourself.
[137:43.94]This will be certain death, warns Throff.
[137:50.04]Why would I do this?
[137:51.65]It's just suicide.
[137:57.52]Even my spirit is like, what are you doing?
[138:03.59]Bundle in the pit.
[138:04.67]This is probably loot.
[138:10.33]What a terrible fucking idea.
[138:14.18]Do it.
[138:16.89]Then you act, you topple yourself over the edge of the pit and land awkwardly on your leg.
[138:21.49]The two skunk bears also jump, one from either side landing on you with the joy of a child diving into a box of feathers.
[138:29.24]You've been devoured by skunk bears.
[138:36.10]Why did I, why did you guys tell me to do this?
[138:38.70]Why did I do that?
[138:40.65]Why did I actually do that?
[138:42.33]Everyone told me to fucking do it.
[138:44.33]I thought it was gonna be some trick.
[138:46.01]I thought it was gonna be something else is gonna happen.
[138:48.15]I'm dead.
[138:52.55]That's like... What the fuck?
[139:08.30]I figured that people, everyone, so many people were telling me to do that, that I figured there had to be something up.
[139:14.23]Why would that even be an option?
[139:22.84]Why would that even be an option?
[139:27.58]Aye, aye, aye.
[139:35.34]You can do better than this for fuck's sake.
[139:37.90]I just want to see what it was.
[139:38.88]We were pretty much done over here anyways, weren't we?
[139:41.09]Because I've already... This is where the goblins were, right?
[139:45.13]I like already been in these towers.
[139:47.09]That was the last one I hadn't been in.
[139:48.13]Or maybe this one too.
[139:52.75]We learned a lot.
[139:54.31]I'm fine.
[139:54.85]Don't worry.
[139:55.32]Everyone's freaking out.
[139:56.12]I just threw myself into a pit of skunk bears.
[139:58.48]For abso-fucking-lutely-no-reason.
[140:00.72]And with that, I'm going to go take a piss.
[140:02.30]And go get a refill.
[140:04.86]Okay, hold on.
[140:05.60]Gaming talk for a minute.
[140:06.68]Let me tell you something about Final Fantasy, guys.
[140:08.64]Okay?
[140:09.50]Final Fantasy 2?
[140:11.40]Where the fuck was Final Fantasy 3?
[140:12.76]It should have came out like two weeks later.
[140:14.64]See you guys in a minute.
[140:20.52]I'll be right back.
[141:24.92]No, no.
[142:09.69]Alright.
[142:13.09]Rip stream?
[142:13.63]What are you talking about up here?
[142:14.44]Let's take this opportunity to say hello to some people.
[142:19.88]As we do from time to time.

[142:40.13]Well, that's one.
[142:41.89]That is one in... It's been what?
[142:44.77]Like two and a half hours?
[142:47.87]That's... That's pretty good for me.
[142:50.55]This is not dying for two straight hours in sorcery.
[142:55.25]But, yeah, it's going good.
[142:57.11]Thank you, Chase, though, for these nine months.

[144:25.96]Jeez, what happens if chat tells you to jump off a bridge then?
[144:29.16]Gonna have to listen.
[144:32.86]Let us continue.
[144:34.66]So now... Why do I taste blood?
[144:40.40]What?
[144:41.89]I got like a bloody nose right now?
[144:45.17]Doesn't make any sense.
[144:46.97]Okay.
[144:47.63]Well, let's go into the square.
[144:53.44]Orthocone.
[144:54.10]Hey, what's going on, Orthocone?
[144:56.50]13 months in a row.
[144:57.72]Hope you have a great day and no Snaticats have snuck up.
[145:01.42]Hope your day is great and no Snaticats have snuck up on you.
[145:03.52]Well, I was a Snaticat today.
[145:06.63]But thank you for 13 months.
[145:09.15]You're dying in real life.
[145:12.17]Alright, we went this way.
[145:17.70]Let's now go this way.
[145:22.66]There's a whole lot... Oh my god.
[145:26.90]How many more spells do I need to learn how to fucking counter in this game?
[145:31.09]Apparently a shitload.
[145:33.27]Let's go.
[145:37.67]Alright.
[145:38.05]Let me just take a nice long sip.
[145:47.49]Alright.
[145:48.29]I've already been here.
[145:48.81]Let's make a move.
[145:49.68]This was...
[145:51.71]Uh, the pillory over there.
[145:52.55]We're gonna go down the alley.
[145:57.33]Okay, we've been... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[145:59.55]We've already been down here once.
[146:01.42]But did not go... We went to the tavern.
[146:05.70]We didn't go down here.
[146:07.40]By the alleys.
[146:11.82]Alright, you follow the road to a junction where a collection of nestled, winding alleys lead away.
[146:16.27]Peering down them hints at a maze of twisting paths and shadowy nooks.
[146:20.58]There's a small fire here with a few figures sit glumly round.
[146:25.62]Okay.
[146:29.84]Spend the night by the fire.
[146:31.20]Wait a minute.
[146:31.64]No.
[146:32.62]I don't know these people.
[146:34.43]Look at the people.
[146:36.37]The people gathered here have a cluster of tents to one side along with a pack of gear.
[146:40.49]A small fire burns in a dugout pit and they sit around it chatting over a bubbling stew.
[146:47.40]Size him up.
[146:51.19]Mmm, let's go up to the fire You approach the fire, but something about your appearance must be foreboding as no one will talk to you a Rat scurries over your foot and then stands nearby boldly staring oh Cuz I'm a guard I'm gonna alright spend the night if they're afraid of me, then I'm just gonna sleep by the fire.
[147:14.54]Oh
[147:16.33]You put your pack down against one side of the street, a little way out of the circle of firelight.
[147:20.75]The group around the fire pay you no attention.
[147:28.01]They wouldn't rob from me.
[147:37.19]The wig?
[147:37.81]Is it the wig?
[147:40.78]Could be the wig.
[147:47.58]I have no idea.
[147:48.02]I'm just going to sleep.
[147:49.02]Who gives a shit?
[147:52.99]Close my eyes.
[147:54.87]Time to dream.
[147:59.73]The long night is restless with visions, and after all the while you hear distant laughter in the east.
[148:04.33]Whatever.
[148:08.13]The Archmage is aware of you.
[148:12.81]You wake the next morning to find the narrow street still in darkness.
[148:15.25]You get quickly to your feet once more.
[148:17.79]Cast a spell.
[148:19.55]Terrifying Wig.
[148:25.89]Just whip a grenade and just throw a grenade.
[148:28.03]That'd be so terrible.
[148:32.31]Can I do Illusion of Worship?
[148:34.23]Let's see the future.
[148:43.28]Yeah, talk with animals.
[148:45.00]There's a rat running around here, right?
[148:48.44]Pulling out the green wig, you put it on and cast the spell.
[148:51.96]Hello, dear, the rat says.
[148:54.24]Alright.
[148:54.66]It wasn't like being a rat.
[149:09.63]What are the dangers of the alleys?
[149:12.46]Lots of nasty types hiding in there.
[149:14.74]And some of the old buildings are dangerous.
[149:17.12]Plus, you might be stepped on.
[149:19.60]Well, actually, never mind about that last one.
[149:25.20]I love this guy.
[149:26.08]How do I get through the alleys?
[149:28.32]Oh, easy.
[149:29.34]Just look for the bronze dome.
[149:31.53]Massive it is, even for a tall one like you.
[149:36.95]Bronze dome.
[149:38.31]What direction is it in?
[149:40.61]Direction?
[149:41.51]Huh?
[149:43.62]You know, East... No, he doesn't understand the code.
[149:45.52]He's a rat.
[149:46.12]Can you point the way?
[149:48.48]He shakes his head.
[149:50.34]Follow the smell of bronze.
[149:51.56]That's what I do.
[149:52.82]You can smell bronze, right?
[149:57.61]What is on the other side?
[150:00.03]Of the average?
[150:01.19]More of the same.
[150:02.33]Mud and stone.
[150:03.93]Best be off before those blokes catch me for their dinner.
[150:07.66]He scampers off into a hole.
[150:13.24]Oh, I love these little rats.
[150:14.52]The rat was fucking awesome.
[150:16.20]Why can't I just, like, keep them with me?
[150:21.69]The smell of bronze.
[150:23.01]Oh, did you smell bronze?
[150:26.63]It's easy.
[150:28.25]What if... I love this game.
[150:29.80]There's so many rats.
[150:30.70]It's perfect.
[150:34.48]I'm gonna size them up.
[150:38.02]You look over the group around the fire.
[150:39.57]They are poor and half-starved.
[150:41.83]But there are at least 30 of them.
[150:43.77]You cannot hope to overpower them all.
[150:45.69]If you were to attack, you would most likely be surrounded and stabbed in the back.
[150:52.69]I'm not going to go fight 30 people.
[150:55.37]No way.
[150:56.11]What else can I do?
[150:59.48]You just talked to a rat in front of a lot of people.
[151:02.62]And guess what?
[151:05.72]Let's be completely real about this.
[151:09.30]Every time I use Yap on a skunk bear or a bird or a monster, they always say this, like, Eat!
[151:19.69]Eat him!
[151:22.07]Do it on a rat?
[151:23.29]Extremely intelligent, extremely social, and helpful.
[151:28.49]Why does everybody hate rats?
[151:30.09]They're really smart, they're really cute, and they're really happy, and they're really intelligent.
[151:34.53]Every rat I've done Yap to has been good.
[151:38.29]Except for the one that puked.
[151:40.15]And still, he won me a lot of money.
[151:46.31]Purr, unknown.
[151:49.66]It worked on the hog.
[151:50.54]It did work on the pig.
[151:51.88]It did work on the pig.
[151:53.52]That's true.
[151:57.26]Uh, rap?
[151:58.16]Talk all languages.
[152:00.40]Let me, like, speak all their languages.
[152:03.74]Taking the wig from your pack, you wear it and form your spell, but nothing else occurs.
[152:07.26]Although some of the scavengers clustered here talk in a curious dialect, it is not an unknown tongue, and so the spell has little to work on.
[152:14.55]After a while, it fades away, and all you've learned from your trouble are a few more curious back-gutter swear words.
[152:24.39]Look at the alleys.
[152:25.09]Let's take a look.
[152:27.74]The alleys are a rat's nest of buildings and winding streets.
[152:30.87]They seem to go on forever and yet curve immediately away out of sight.
[152:38.45]Explore the alleys or follow the road.
[152:40.29]Nobody here will talk to me because I'm a guard.
[152:43.40]Well, there's the bronze dome that he was talking about.
[152:46.10]That's how you get out of there.
[152:47.12]Let's take a look over here.
[152:52.64]I don't want to go in the alleys.
[152:55.53]Purr and make the cats meow.
[152:58.44]You pass by the alleys and follow the road as it heads towards the rising wall of Mampang.
[153:03.07]After a while, the path opens out into a stony clearing.
[153:06.15]The early morning sun makes the air glow.
[153:08.65]Guards walk this way and that across the space.
[153:13.41]Look at the people.
[153:15.07]The people in the square are moving this way and that seemingly without purpose.
[153:18.44]They all seem quite concerned and busy, however.
[153:23.10]Sure thing.
[153:48.10]You cross into the middle of the small square.
[153:49.98]Guards move this way and that across the flagstones.
[153:52.17]In one corner of the square is a tent from which rich smells are rising.
[153:57.15]Food server.
[153:58.85]The food seller has a low tent with a cooking stove.
[154:00.87]A few of the square's wandering populace pause by to eat before continuing on their endless circuits.
[154:06.15]This is not a good place to hang around.
[154:10.69]The food tent by the door.
[154:13.59]Well, I could use a lot.
[154:15.06]I could use food right now.
[154:17.98]There are stairs, a little still cold but fresh.
[154:20.12]How many times has it said that?
[154:21.18]Still cold, still icy, but still fresh, still icy.
[154:24.81]You approach the small kitchen.
[154:26.47]To one side, a long table is crowded with people eating their meals.
[154:29.89]The chef bustles through the kitchen.
[154:33.09]You hungry?
[154:36.65]Buy a meal.
[154:38.35]Yes, there we go.
[154:40.75]The chef tells you to reach for a bowl.
[154:44.84]Sure.
[154:46.57]You pay taking your meal to the table, you slurp it up, the meal is disgusting.
[154:53.45]You leave your dirty dish.
[154:57.35]Okay, well... Alright.
[155:03.01]You return to the middle of the small square.
[155:05.11]Guards patrol the area.
[155:06.35]A few clouds move across the heavens.
[155:08.27]A pair of sightmasters in deep discussion cross the square, but they do not notice you amongst the other guards.
[155:14.77]Clearly, life in Mampang has lessened their powers of sight.
[155:17.85]They disappear into an alley mouth.
[155:19.89]This is not a good place to hang around.
[155:24.01]Don't I have to kill a sightmaster?
[155:30.29]Can I buy another piece?
[155:31.54]Can I buy some more dinner?
[155:35.41]The smell of food stalls fills your nostrils as you approach.
[155:37.67]The chef looks up.
[155:39.11]Did you today?
[155:41.57]Buy one.
[155:42.57]You never go.
[155:44.03]Buy one.
[155:46.22]Food is fine.
[155:46.94]Why was that food better?
[155:50.60]Okay.
[155:53.04]I'm going to talk to him.
[155:57.93]See if he knows anything.
[156:02.01]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[156:02.57]Alright.
[156:02.91]Talk to the food seller.
[156:04.69]You attract the attention of the chef.
[156:06.65]Yeah.
[156:07.53]You want to eat?
[156:08.03]Uh... What are the people all doing here?
[156:14.62]Eh?
[156:15.38]Eating.
[156:16.16]I don't know what you mean by that, waiting.
[156:18.78]Waiting for what?
[156:20.24]To be dated.
[156:20.70]It wasn't long ago you seen me go away.
[156:24.20]What?
[156:24.34]Excuse me, say that again?
[156:25.05]What?
[156:26.01]What is this part of the city?
[156:27.93]It is where small island men...
[156:31.28]What lies beyond the east wall?
[156:33.18]The chef seems to shiver.
[156:35.01]Buy a meal.
[156:35.27]The dish is adequate.
[156:36.67]Okay.
[156:36.81]He didn't know shit.
[156:37.53]Alright, I'm by the door.
[156:39.23]Let's take a look at some of this shit.
[156:59.23]You make your way to the far wall into which is a set low door.
[157:03.11]You turn to see that the guards in the square have noticed you, but your disguise appears to reassure them you are not stopped.
[157:09.68]Make a move.
[157:10.70]Which way now?
[157:12.40]We're going to start exploring these domes.
[157:17.08]You step through the door into a curiously quiet area of stone.
[157:19.84]Low towers rise from a dark pool of icy-looking water.
[157:23.50]With paths snaking across from one another, the whole place is worn and ruined.
[157:27.62]You cannot help but shiver.
[157:28.59]Your back is amongst the haunted, powerful towers of the abandoned quarter of Manpang.
[157:32.97]The sun bakes the flagstones.
[157:36.53]Okay, here we go.
[157:39.29]Let's start the- Jesus fucking God.
[157:42.96]It's time to explore.
[157:49.33]Alright.
[157:50.11]Base of the stone tower.
[157:51.06]Yeah, we know the path is going to split.
[157:54.64]Let's go.
[157:55.99]Let's I mean, let's start with this one down here along the path.
[158:02.47]That's the one I want to go to because it's the first one down here.
[158:04.65]Look at the black tower.
[158:26.60]You reach out and gently touch the black surface of the tower by the wall.
[158:30.34]It is hard to the touch, smooth and cool.
[158:33.28]If there was even a doorway here, you cannot make it out.
[158:39.79]Smash the black coating?
[158:42.15]No, what is it?
[158:44.25]It's like a thick... I don't have a medicinal potion.
[158:55.06]Heal disease?
[158:55.58]Definitely not.
[158:58.91]Uh... See the future.
[159:08.00]How... No.
[159:11.42]It's some spell I have to counter.
[159:12.65]I just don't know what the hell it is.
[159:16.49]Pep.
[159:17.57]Cause strength.
[159:18.27]I don't have fire water.
[159:19.71]That's just fucking swell.
[159:22.57]Purr.
[159:23.51]Purr.
[159:27.14]What?
[159:29.32]Are you serious?
[159:31.32]Wait, hold on a second.
[159:32.94]What the fuck did I just do?
[159:34.70]I just did it for fun.
[159:36.70]You cast the spell and before your eyes, the black coating seems to trickle away into the ground.
[159:39.96]The tower is revealed.
[159:47.93]Okay, go.
[159:49.73]Step inside.
[159:52.09]You step back, unwilling to enter the tower in case it closes up behind you once more, and indeed it does close up.
[159:58.78]What?
[160:05.25]What the hell is going on?
[160:09.87]If this... What is this countering?
[160:12.89]It's not costing me stamina.
[160:16.93]Look inside.
[160:19.61]You peer inside the curious tower, but the interior is shadowy and dark.
[160:23.37]Go inside.
[160:24.95]What?
[160:25.57]You step inside the tower.
[160:26.54]What the fuck?
[160:27.06]What?
[160:29.65]I said step away?
[160:30.51]Oh, well, it was a fucking misclick.
[160:36.89]Hey, you guys didn't figure out the fucking purse spell like I did.
[160:41.39]I do read.
[160:41.97]It's just sometimes I click the wrong thing.
[160:46.20]Yeah.
[160:50.74]You said step away, you fucking idiot.
[160:56.58]Guys, let me remind you of something.
[161:00.04]Don't ever miss click in front of somebody if you accidentally click something that you didn't mean to click People people will scream in your face remember it's very important for you to know this it's extremely important You apparently turn into a like small child if you accidentally click something Here's the point
[161:35.51]Hold on a second.
[161:36.11]Let me make a phone call.
[161:37.03]Let me just call real quick.
[161:39.59]Make a quick call to... No, it's not going to work.
[161:42.93]Never mind.
[161:43.15]I'm not going to do it.
[161:48.97]Idiot streamer.
[161:49.85]Dim clicker.
[161:50.63]Hold on.
[162:02.11]I'll type it.
[162:04.30]I was just kidding.
[162:05.14]I'm kidding.
[162:06.32]Don't worry.
[162:11.88]He made a mistake.
[162:12.69]Burn him.
[162:13.01]I just clicked the fucking wrong thing.
[162:14.51]It's easy.
[162:15.77]Look it.
[162:16.05]I'll show you how easy it is.
[162:17.69]See?
[162:20.33]Look where my mouse is.
[162:22.05]My mouse is still on it.
[162:24.40]Just look.
[162:24.80]I need you to look.
[162:25.88]I need you to look.
[162:27.30]I need you to look.
[162:30.26]Look it.
[162:31.40]I need you to look.
[162:33.16]See?
[162:33.32]See?
[162:36.24]I need you!
[162:37.32]To look!
[162:40.60]Okay.
[162:41.28]The dim room smells musty, like the interior of an old chest.
[162:44.88]There's no light, the tiny windows are all covered over with curious thick black substance that coats the walls and floor.
[162:50.03]It's called Twitch.
[163:01.04]The substance seems to spout in slow globs from an outlet set into a raised block of stone in the middle of the chamber.
[163:09.58]Okay, um... Do I want to touch the floor?
[163:17.62]Um...
[163:29.71]Anybody reading glasses?
[163:30.93]Uh, let's look at the stone block.
[163:32.61]The positioning of the block is like that on an altar, but the pipe drilled through it reminds you of alchemical equipment.
[163:38.32]The thick sludge coming through does not remind of anything much, however.
[163:44.10]I feel like touching the slime is a terrible fucking idea.
[163:53.73]Should I touch it?
[163:54.33]Should I just touch the floor?
[163:55.45]Should I touch the black slime?
[164:02.27]Let's touch the slime.
[164:05.31]Oh, fuck.
[164:06.71]You reach out to touch the oozing black slime coming from the altar block.
[164:09.43]It is curiously warm and quick-moving, covering your fingertips in moments, and then seeming to climb as though alive or driven by some strange force up your hand towards your wrist.
[164:18.49]You snatch your arm away, but find you are already quite stuck.
[164:24.83]Please, Throff.
[164:26.11]Please, you're here with me right now.
[164:27.45]Please.
[164:31.72]maybe this is a good thing maybe I'll get a symbiote soon I'll be venom pray for aid you close your eyes and raise a prayer to throth but nothing seems to change struggle you struggle and the goo seems to react by setting harder and faster around you it shrinks as it cools and you feel it tugging one by one of the tiny hairs on your hand and wrist but then you feel something else a gathering strength tug free
[165:01.17]You tried to tug free, but the hardened slime is like iron around your wrists, but you are definitely growing stronger.
[165:06.92]I'm going to wait.
[165:17.97]You wait, unsure what else you can do.
[165:19.21]You feel as though your fibers of your body are growing thicker with every movement.
[165:33.71]Is Throff protecting me right now?
[165:35.43]I don't know.
[165:39.53]What if I close my eyes?
[165:45.84]Close my eyes.
[165:48.48]You close your eyes trying to understand what is happening inside you.
[165:51.20]More and more of the goo is flowing over you.
[165:53.00]You feel your arm muscles growing in size.
[165:58.33]What?
[165:59.99]Wait.
[166:01.99]You keep waiting, trying to calm your breathing, but it is coming in ragged gasps now.
[166:06.78]Your heart is beginning to pound hard and fast in your chest.
[166:10.56]Your breath is growing short.
[166:16.52]I gained maximum stamina?
[166:21.50]How do I get, like... Should I rip it off?
[166:26.73]You tug again, but nothing happens.
[166:28.19]The goo flows further around you.
[166:31.48]Get it off me!
[166:35.30]Holy shit.
[166:37.29]With your newfound power, you tug on the bond around your wrist, and as you roar with fury, your arm breaks free, shattering the black slime in all directions.
[166:44.31]You are free, and more powerful than ever before.
[166:46.97]That was easy.
[166:52.09]That was real easy to go from 16 to 22 max stamina.
[166:54.27]Cool.
[166:56.88]I really am stamina.
[166:59.46]I really am stamina!
[167:01.60]That's my new character.
[167:04.66]Alright, I'm gonna get like a touch the floor.
[167:08.94]You run your fingers over the slime on the floor.
[167:10.74]Mere seconds after leaving the pipe, it is congealed into a glassy layer, cool and smooth, like caramelized sugar.
[167:18.15]You step outside once more into the cool of the ruins.
[167:20.37]You feel three times the man you were.
[167:26.93]Well, tower solved.
[167:36.51]I had to watch a lot of ads.
[167:38.57]But can I, let me just say, those of you guys that are watching a bunch of ads to give bits to me, that's like, I can't imagine someone doing that.
[167:52.62]Watching like 35 ads in a row.
[167:56.18]So like, that's like, thank you.
[167:57.56]Like, you don't have to do that.
[167:58.60]But that's extremely kind for someone to do something like that.
[168:03.49]So thank you very much, man.
[168:08.60]You follow the path of stepping stones away from the black coated tower until it joins the main path once more.
[168:13.52]The wind picks up a little spray from the water and splashes it into your face.
[168:16.82]It stings where it touches you.
[168:25.43]I'm not going to fuck with the water.
[168:26.41]It's going to hurt me.
[168:29.42]Alright.
[168:30.70]Let's do this tower.
[168:36.38]Thin heat beats down from an empty sky.
[168:37.90]You reach the base of a stone tower with a curved archway at its base.
[168:40.77]The path splits around it.
[168:43.61]Okay.
[168:46.17]Inside this tower.
[168:50.49]The sun is beginning to lower and the air begins to cool.
[168:52.63]Icy, but fresh.
[168:54.25]You cross the waters and push your way inside the crumbling tower without knowing what you might find.
[168:59.18]The inner doors you stand in front of are twice your height and look to be made of solid metal.
[169:05.02]The air is thick with an incredible smell.
[169:11.94]Listen at the door.
[169:14.68]You place your ear to the metal and leap backwards.
[169:17.14]The door is searing hot.
[169:19.04]The wooden handle should be safe to touch though.
[169:25.45]You sniff the air, smoke, melting metal.
[169:29.32]It is as though a gigantic smithy lies behind this door.
[169:39.90]Etalyx is here.
[169:40.76]You can't... Hold on a second.
[169:41.90]Etalyx is here?
[169:46.96]Please welcome, Etalyx.
[169:49.15]Hope your stream went well, Etalyx.
[169:51.59]Oh, you're hosting me right now.
[169:52.67]Oh, jeez.
[169:53.25]Oh, hi.
[169:54.41]You probably did this like an hour ago.
[169:58.59]But Etalyx, make sure you give Etalyx a follow.
[170:01.41]He's now streaming.
[170:03.38]He's a streamer now.
[170:04.62]Give him a fucking follow.
[170:06.30]I command it.
[170:08.68]I fucking demand it.
[170:14.14]Nah, he's a good dude.
[170:15.25]He's here.
[170:15.97]Say hi.
[170:17.73]Alright, let's try the handle.
[170:21.41]As you grasp the handle, you notice it is almost too hot to touch.
[170:27.09]Open the door.
[170:27.62]Crack.
[170:29.67]The doors are very heavy, but you manage enough control to only open them halfway.
[170:33.95]You spy a roaring flame just inside the door.
[170:36.30]This room must be some kind of furnace.
[170:41.34]Fuck you, Jerma.
[170:46.54]You don't own me.
[170:49.54]I'm just kidding.
[170:50.04]You do whatever you want.
[170:50.80]I'm kidding.
[170:51.22]Don't worry.
[170:54.37]Don't you know that 65% of everything I say is 55% of the time at least half of that time not true or me kidding around?
[171:03.61]And then like a piece of that percentage is real, but I'm saying it in a way that is not real.
[171:12.75]You know, what is a door anyways?
[171:14.23]What is a door?
[171:15.29]And then two doors open on the side and you can exit if you want to.
[171:24.72]Alright, let's go.
[171:27.94]You slip carefully into the room, which is filled with roaring flames.
[171:34.70]You can't see the source of the blaze, but it surely is a miracle that it's not spread to the other building to the fortress.
[171:40.31]The flames seem to show no sign of dying down, either.
[171:43.55]You're already sweating from the heat.
[171:45.49]While the flames lick through the whole room, you might be able to pick a path through them.
[171:49.81]You stand at the room's threshold.
[171:53.35]Run through the flames.
[171:58.75]No.
[172:03.11]What can I do in here?
[172:05.45]Run through?
[172:05.85]I'm not going to run through the flames.
[172:15.11]I don't have... I can't do teleportation.
[172:16.75]This would have been really, really good if I had this green ring.
[172:24.49]Dim, cause stupidity.
[172:25.89]No.
[172:26.19]Why would I do that?
[172:31.60]Uh, nip caused speed.
[172:32.68]I don't have yellow powder.
[172:34.98]Great.
[172:38.79]Huff.
[172:39.39]Mmm, I could blow the fire out, couldn't I?
[172:45.63]Six.
[172:46.17]Clone the caster.
[172:50.84]I'm doing it.
[172:53.44]You move the starlight into order around you, and five clones step out from behind you, forming a semicircle.
[173:01.49]Order one to run in.
[173:03.36]Order them all to walk in.
[173:07.30]Order one to explore the room.
[173:10.54]You send one to explore the room.
[173:11.82]He warily enters, dancing around the flames, but does not make it far.
[173:16.34]Trying to turn back, he is soon overwhelmed by the smoke.
[173:20.06]The other clones stare into the distance impassively as their comrades' terrible screams echo the room.
[173:28.39]Hey, you!
[173:29.05]You, run in!
[173:30.51]You order one to run into the flames.
[173:32.99]With an uncertain look on his face, the clone dashes in wordlessly.
[173:37.17]He disappears.
[173:39.36]Then a few moments later returns without any signs of injury.
[173:42.98]Strange, considering the fate of the first clone you sent into the fires.
[173:47.52]A moment later, the clones disappear.
[173:52.16]Huh?
[173:56.01]So he's... He used it as like a sprinkler?
[174:01.65]Okay.
[174:04.17]I'm gonna run through.
[174:04.87]Run through the flames.
[174:07.36]You fling yourself into the room, sprinting through the fire with reckless abandon.
[174:10.58]Flames lick your clothes.
[174:12.26]Keep going.
[174:12.62]Run.
[174:13.72]You keep going.
[174:14.44]You are halfway across and there is no heat or burn.
[174:16.96]The flames are cool to your skin.
[174:19.27]An illusion!
[174:21.01]You reach the end of the room unharmed.
[174:22.95]By the door you see a Grimalkin.
[174:27.22]Well, good thing I had that guy.
[174:30.62]Only one of them died.
[174:31.38]Only one person died.
[174:32.26]It's okay.
[174:36.12]Jeremy, you know the hot counter spell.
[174:37.35]Why wouldn't you counter it?
[174:38.19]This is not hot.
[174:38.97]This is an illusion, man.
[174:40.91]This ain't real fire.
[174:44.89]But why did the other guy die?
[174:48.67]No idea.
[174:49.79]You examine the Grimalkin.
[174:50.69]It is much like the one in the Chamber of Night.
[174:53.19]A bracelet made of bone hangs on... Ooh, ivory or bone.
[174:58.02]Take it.
[174:58.90]Take the bracelet.
[175:02.30]Now I can do illusions.
[175:04.36]Sweet.
[175:04.69]Ow.
[175:04.99]You lift the bracelet of bone from the arm.
[175:06.41]Immediately the fire in the room disappears.
[175:08.57]Without the bracelet, it seems the Grimalkin cannot sustain the illusion.
[175:12.07]You leave the room behind.
[175:15.35]Etalyx just gave 100 bits.
[175:17.39]I just want to see if I get four badges by my name or not.
[175:24.89]Okay.
[175:25.65]So I now have illusion shit.
[175:29.25]Test, test, test.
[175:29.95]Etalyx, no, you do not have four badges.
[175:33.03]Disappointed.
[175:35.99]I want to go in this one.
[175:37.19]South door, we're going to go this way.
[175:39.28]We're going to go piece by piece.
[175:43.78]Along the path.
[175:47.30]Make a move.
[175:47.78]That's the black tower I was already in.
[175:50.66]Into the eastern tower.
[175:55.54]You enter the next tower nervously.
[175:57.37]A fetid scent assaults your nostrils.
[175:59.29]The inside of the tower is cavernous, far larger than should be possible.
[176:04.23]The stone floor on which you stand is turned to a thin strip of soft Earth, choked with reeds, and beyond it is a deep pool of foul-smelling water.
[176:15.06]Okie dokie.
[176:17.87]Look across the swamp.
[176:19.99]Insects buzz and the reeds rustle as creatures pass between them.
[176:23.35]You cannot spot the ceiling of this room, but there must be one, surely.
[176:27.25]In the center of the marsh, a platform with a low hut sits, perched on rotten stilts.
[176:32.48]A boardwalk leads to it, dotted with spent torches.
[176:38.92]So this is a platform with a bunch of marsh and swamps all around it and a hut in the middle.
[176:50.30]Step onto the boardwalk.
[176:52.80]You step onto the boards, which creak under your weight, causing the torches to sway gently.
[176:57.59]You see no movement in the hut.
[176:59.35]The wood creaks under your feet.
[177:02.13]Okay, hold on.
[177:05.45]Okay.
[177:10.02]Um... This mud create quicksand.
[177:15.44]Which, hey, guarantee you that's what's underneath me right now.
[177:19.74]Law?
[177:22.32]What does that counter?
[177:23.20]I don't know.
[177:29.91]What would counter mud?
[177:34.07]Pop?
[177:34.57]No, that's wall.
[177:40.06]You guys doing a Shrek right now?
[177:43.78]Somebody once told me.
[177:49.34]The world was gonna roll me.
[177:52.94]I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.
[177:56.84]So much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with taking the back street?
[178:00.28]I don't know what to do.
[178:04.93]Niff?
[178:05.73]Cause stench?
[178:06.67]No.
[178:11.05]So the words start coming, then they don't stop coming.
[178:13.23]Head to the rules and you hit the ground running.
[178:22.84]Ooh, that count as mud.
[178:24.34]Let's do it.
[178:27.42]Oh, what the fuck have I done?
[178:29.20]I was just saying that for no reason.
[178:36.87]You weave the enchantment, but the force field does not materialize.
[178:39.11]Instead, the whirlpool begins to slow and then it stills.
[178:42.11]The water begins to clear.
[178:43.69]Why would the swamp be affected by such a spell?
[178:46.51]Yeah, so that was quicksand.
[178:47.57]Good thing I didn't step in it.
[178:50.12]The boardwalk creaks and lurches to the side.
[178:51.68]You manage to keep your balance and it stills, though it is now slanted.
[178:57.00]Why are people clipping that?
[179:01.47]Let's make a move.
[179:03.43]It's not safe.
[179:04.35]Walk to the hut.
[179:06.43]You begin to walk towards the hut when you hear a snap.
[179:08.65]The boardwalk begins to tilt sideways and you scramble to keep your footing.
[179:11.99]It is about to collapse.
[179:14.34]Leap!
[179:16.04]As the boardwalk begins to slip into the marsh, you leap with all your strength.
[179:19.76]Flying through the air, you slam into the edge of the hut's platform, scrabbling for purchase as you wheeze with the impact.
[179:25.86]You pull yourself up, a sucking sound behind you as the marsh absorbs the wood.
[179:31.89]Well, we made it into the hut.
[179:34.63]Watch the clip.
[179:38.43]No, I'm not doing that.
[179:40.15]I'm not doing that.
[179:44.16]You are safe now inside the hut.
[179:46.20]There is very little here.
[179:49.28]A row of tables with some rotten chairs tucked in beneath.
[179:52.33]On one of the tables, a stack of damp parchment is slowly turning into fur.
[179:57.13]On one side of the hut is a ragged hole in the floor.
[180:01.73]Look over the parchments.
[180:04.89]The parchments appear to be the scrawled log notes of whoever was stationed here.
[180:09.82]The opening remarks are simple.
[180:12.28]The spell has taken root.
[180:14.07]The reaction is self-sustaining and appears to be maintaining scale.
[180:19.49]Read on.
[180:20.81]Day 2.
[180:21.85]The spell has been self-perpetuating for 30 hours and appears to be entirely stable.
[180:26.21]Success!
[180:28.45]Day 4.
[180:29.57]The boardwalk is definitely sagging.
[180:31.84]I do not believe it can take my weight anymore.
[180:34.94]Day 6.
[180:36.06]The force fields appear to work.
[180:37.84]For brief periods of time, they are countering successfully.
[180:41.29]but they are tiring to cast.
[180:44.65]Which day is it?
[180:45.91]The last of my supplies are exhausted.
[180:47.72]The whirlpool is exhibiting strange behavior.
[180:50.26]Whatever lies beneath seems to have reached capacity or is pushing back.
[180:56.86]Something has climbed up from the whirlpool.
[180:59.22]I can feel it moving underneath the hut.
[181:02.41]Oh, Jesus.
[181:04.27]Tell Rosa I miss her.
[181:05.71]Tell Valaquest she can go to Hell's Wealth without a fur coat.
[181:12.64]Whatever it is.
[181:14.08]Search the drawers.
[181:15.78]You quickly rifle the drawers and tables, but it seems whoever cleared out nothing, they didn't leave shit except the notes of their dumb work, and they get eaten by a snatter monster.
[181:25.46]Look at the hole.
[181:27.48]Being careful not to go too close, you lean over the hole in the floorboards and look down to the mud pool.
[181:32.24]You cannot help but notice the scratch marks of claws in the planks near the hole.
[181:36.86]The boardwalk is gone and you cannot stay here, so you have no choice but to drop down into the water and swim.
[181:46.14]Okay.
[181:49.28]Once in the water, you spread your arms, trying to keep upright.
[181:52.02]Thankfully, the whirlpool has dissipated due to your spellcasting.
[181:55.23]The water is filthy, but it does not swirl.
[181:58.43]Still, your fleas have been washed away.
[182:00.23]I had fleas this whole time?
[182:05.27]You swim with strong strokes.
[182:07.15]The water is quite still.
[182:09.27]Disgusting.
[182:09.99]It still is that way.
[182:11.16]And small creatures flicker on either side of you.
[182:13.62]You will carry this smell on you for some time.
[182:17.14]Swim for the shore.
[182:18.52]You swim back to the shore, shaking off the water as best you can.
[182:23.80]Let's go this way.
[182:27.28]In honor of watching a hundred ads to give you money, here's the next dollar.
[182:31.98]Well, thank you, dude.
[182:34.89]You take a moment to regain your breath.
[182:36.53]Thick, foul water streams from your cloak.
[182:38.63]Nearby is a frothy, bubbling section of water.
[182:41.52]It is large and seems to be getting more agitated as you draw near.
[182:52.04]There's a giant monster.
[182:54.20]Get the fuck out of here.
[182:57.62]Oh!
[182:57.78]Oh!
[183:03.57]What is that thing?
[183:05.49]What is that thing?
[183:07.31]You turn to head back, but a rumbling comes from behind you.
[183:11.05]You turn to see the frothing water explode upwards.
[183:13.89]It towers above you, a lumping mass of mud and reeds.
[183:17.40]Massive arms stretch out and a huge gaping mouth opens.
[183:22.12]It's a slime eater.
[183:28.50]Slime eater, huh?
[183:36.11]Big.
[183:37.33]I don't even care about the other things.
[183:38.65]Big.
[183:41.85]Your beauty stamina bar will be no match for my huge fucking size.
[183:47.75]Consulting the constellations overhead, you bind the spell for a moment.
[183:50.87]It seems nothing will happen, then suddenly you begin to grow to three times your normal size.
[183:57.12]You are now a size to match the monster.
[183:59.82]With the beast hurt and distracted, now is the time to attack.
[184:02.12]This is going to be so easy.
[184:11.82]I don't even need it.
[184:12.84]Who cares?
[184:13.26]I'm gonna kill him.
[184:13.72]I'm gonna beat him every time.
[184:18.25]I'm gonna beat him every single time.
[184:22.17]Ooh!
[184:23.37]Slime eater!
[184:24.61]What happened?
[184:25.79]Full blast.
[184:27.15]You're dead.
[184:27.93]No, not quite.
[184:32.62]Now he is.
[184:33.98]Fucking easy.
[184:35.80]No stamina.
[184:36.56]Flawless fighting.
[184:39.95]Your sword didn't grow.
[184:41.03]Yeah, it did, look.
[184:46.41]Okay.
[184:47.81]The slime-eater's corpse slips underneath the waves.
[184:50.05]The fireflies, disturbed by the battle, soon settle back into their routines.
[184:55.50]Let's take a look.
[184:56.72]You peer into the murky water.
[184:58.14]There's no sign of any more beasts, but then, there was no sign of the last one either.
[185:04.20]Let's go.
[185:04.66]Swim.
[185:04.92]You dive into the water, start swimming.
[185:06.06]Let's get out of here.
[185:07.20]Um...
[185:09.99]Let's go this way.
[185:11.45]I was going to go to that one, but I'll go to this one instead.
[185:14.21]Move up in the water.
[185:17.71]Leave by the north door, the near door.
[185:20.62]There are other doors from this place, but only one that you can reach.
[185:22.62]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[185:23.34]Let's go.
[185:24.70]Remind me that I have to go into this tower.
[185:26.08]I'm going to try to wrap around.
[185:26.92]We're going to go in this one.
[185:31.97]Okay.
[185:33.19]Gradually, you shrink back down to your normal size.
[185:35.53]The sun lowers towards the horizon.
[185:37.71]You approach the next weird tower, wondering what you will find this time.
[185:41.83]You step into the room and then recoil.
[185:44.16]The floor is crawling with bugs.
[185:46.30]Or rather, not crawling.
[185:47.54]The bugs are all standing in orderly rows.
[185:51.70]Oh great, a fucking bug army.
[185:58.56]Look at the bugs.
[186:00.82]You look over the bugs.
[186:02.16]Small bugs, cockroaches, and earwigs fill the gaps between larger bugs.
[186:06.86]Things about the size of goats that otherwise look like lynch bugs.
[186:11.46]Beyond basic breathing and antenna twitching, none of the creatures are moving.
[186:15.01]They appear to be waiting for something.
[186:20.87]Uh... Okay.
[186:24.21]Gigantic ant army.
[186:29.97]Um...
[186:32.65]Magic protection.
[186:38.30]Pep.
[186:40.08]Can't do strength.
[186:41.60]I could throw a grenade.
[186:46.82]Zen.
[186:48.14]Hover in the air.
[186:50.62]Zap.
[186:54.55]Sap.
[186:55.53]I could sap the bugs.
[187:01.47]Sun, create light.
[187:05.87]Sense danger.
[187:06.53]I was thinking law, but I can't do law.
[187:08.69]There's no L. Make him dance, I wish.
[187:18.46]Yeah, it doesn't seem like there's a course of action unless it's sap.
[187:26.16]Let's depress the bugs.
[187:32.21]You bind the stars into a pattern around you and immediately feel yourself losing your energy and drive.
[187:36.64]With no other creatures nearby, the magic is turned on you.
[187:39.26]What are you... What?
[187:41.44]There's a room full of bugs.
[187:48.64]What?
[187:51.73]Oh, that's right.
[187:52.07]There are cockroaches.
[187:54.61]Right?
[187:55.41]And don't bugs hate light?
[187:58.78]This counter's fog.
[188:00.42]We'll try it.
[188:01.31]No stamina loss.
[188:05.49]You craft the spell and the sun jewel in your pack begins to pulse and throb with a brilliant blinding light.
[188:10.11]A few of the cockroaches turn in circles as the jewel illuminates, but whatever is holding them to their positions is stronger than their instinct for darkness, and they stay in position.
[188:26.06]Well...
[188:31.90]Huh.
[188:33.90]Isn't that something?
[188:37.18]Should I just fucking lob a grenade?
[188:38.60]That'll make you move.
[188:44.79]I could do Zen too, but what the hell is that gonna do?
[188:52.61]Yeah, they might have fixedness cast on them, but what is the counter to fixedness?
[189:02.90]I'm gonna step forward.
[189:05.88]You step forwards into the room, expecting the bugs to clear out from underneath your boot.
[189:09.92]They do not.
[189:10.94]You squash a dozen or so, while a few more wriggle uncomfortably as you shear their bodies in half.
[189:18.17]Oh, God.
[189:22.19]Take another step.
[189:24.91]Taking another step into the room, you crush another boot's worth of insects.
[189:29.27]Looking back, you can see your progress marked out in negative space in the rank and file.
[189:38.39]Oh, Jesus.
[189:40.17]Oh, Jesus.
[189:41.21]I'm sorry.
[189:42.09]I'm sorry.
[189:47.22]Alright.
[189:47.56]Sense danger.
[189:52.32]Reaching up to the stars, you create the magic and a steady voice begins to speak.
[189:56.00]The room is full of bugs, the voice tells you helpfully.
[189:59.67]But they will not attack unless you ask them to.
[190:03.41]With that curious advice, the voice fades.
[190:07.67]Ask them to?
[190:12.68]I don't understand.
[190:17.16]What else?
[190:18.38]I can't... There's no law.
[190:23.16]Why is law not an option?
[190:24.69]Yeah.
[190:26.49]Does it just cause strength?
[190:27.55]That doesn't matter.
[190:32.35]It's either zen or zap.
[190:33.71]I haven't done zen.
[190:39.35]You rise gently up into the air.
[190:46.30]What the fuck am I supposed to do in here?
[190:49.68]Cross the tower.
[190:52.22]You float across the tower safely out of reach of the bugs on the floor.
[190:57.42]I have no fucking idea.
[191:04.87]Uh, we're gonna go in this one so I can wrap back down.
[191:11.07]I wonder what I have to do in there.
[191:14.43]The chamber is law?
[191:15.39]Yeah, but what's the counter to law?
[191:18.53]Do I just not have it and I can't cast it?
[191:23.63]You make your way across a stone walkway arching high into the air above the swirling waters that pool below until you reach the next curious tower.
[191:30.64]Your wait returns and you settle gradually back down to the ground.
[191:35.08]It'll be night soon.
[191:37.20]The tower is barred with a solid wooden door.
[191:43.57]Knock on the door.
[191:46.01]You knock on the door.
[191:46.85]There is no reply, but you hear a faint roaring sound through wood.
[191:53.10]Who's in there?
[191:55.48]The door is not locked but it is heavy as though a tremendous force was pulling it closed from the other side.
[192:01.25]You open it an inch and then the door slams itself shut once more.
[192:16.57]Open the door and slip through.
[192:19.09]Fuck.
[192:20.15]You open the door and slip through the gap, but as soon as you are inside the tower, a powerful crossed wind grabs you, hurling you through the air.
[192:26.90]Hold on to my pack.
[192:28.90]The wind flings you across the space and out through the flapping door on the other side.
[192:33.88]As you fly through the space, you spy something in the center, but you're too busy falling this way and that to see what it is.
[192:41.74]Okay.
[192:45.28]The wind fades and... Okay, that's Huff.
[192:47.49]What's the counter to Huff?
[192:53.13]I want to go back here.
[192:53.77]I want to do this again.
[192:57.84]Cast a spell.
[193:00.08]What is the counter for Huff?
[193:05.82]It's definitely slimness.
[193:06.74]It's definitely slimness.
[193:08.53]You've got to make yourself a little too slim.
[193:11.93]Slowness, right?
[193:13.63]Nap?
[193:14.03]No.
[193:15.83]Niff?
[193:17.31]Nip?
[193:18.17]Cause speed?
[193:19.09]Maybe it's probably... It might be speed.
[193:24.36]That's not going to be floating.
[193:30.33]It's not dop.
[193:34.03]I would assume it's probably speed.
[193:39.27]Or fixedness.
[193:40.65]That would make sense.
[193:41.85]But I can't cast that anyways because I don't have the item for it.
[193:44.05]I'm going to turn back.
[193:50.87]I can't cast it.
[193:53.17]Turn back.
[193:56.15]North, I want to go down if I can.
[193:58.29]Because I just have to do... I did this one, this one, this one.
[194:02.25]I want to do this one, and then we'll go down to this one.
[194:03.93]And that leaves us with this row.
[194:08.13]Down.
[194:11.41]Cast Wrap.
[194:13.81]It is hard to imagine this place was ever occupied.
[194:15.74]It seems so lonely and lost.
[194:17.72]Night has fallen, and you are very weak.
[194:19.44]You need to rest.
[194:21.24]Well, let's sleep here.
[194:24.14]What could possibly go wrong?
[194:26.41]I've already eaten today, so I don't need to eat again to avoid hunger.
[194:29.66]Close my eyes.
[194:32.10]Dream.
[194:34.26]What is left of the night is filled with vivid dreams.
[194:36.40]Through it all, you feel the heat of Analand burning, should you quest... Should you quest fail.
[194:41.40]Should you quest fail.
[194:42.20]Should you quest fail.
[194:46.09]Alright, I gained some more maximum stamina, lost a bunch of gold, and found no new clues.
[194:49.51]The archmage is just looking around and shit.
[194:51.33]Alright, move on.
[194:57.38]the south tower the early morning sun makes the air glow you enter the next tower uncertainly but you freeze on the threshold in place of a floor this tower contains nothing but a yawning pit clustered with thin needle-like spikes okay a narrow stone walkway heads away from the door and leads out a short way over the pit but it does not go as far as the door on the far side
[195:26.57]Throw myself onto the spikes.
[195:27.93]Is that what you guys want?
[195:29.75]You guys want to do that again?
[195:31.77]Should I do that again?
[195:32.93]It's an option here.
[195:33.90]Throw myself onto the spikes.
[195:39.84]Throw myself onto the spikes.
[195:41.10]I mean, what could possibly go wrong?
[195:43.30]Right?
[195:45.63]Jeez Louise.
[195:52.48]I'm not going to do it.
[195:54.40]I'm not doing that.
[195:55.94]No fucking chance.
[196:02.54]Look up.
[196:04.12]On a whim, you look up and notice that the ceiling is fairly high and sports several misshapen rock protrusions.
[196:11.83]Look at the spikes.
[196:13.89]If there was a safe way down into the pit, one might be able to slip between the spikes.
[196:17.97]But the sides of the pit are also spiked, and to jump in would be quite suicidal.
[196:22.50]See?
[196:24.12]There's no ledge around the cliff of the edge either.
[196:26.30]Just clone some... throw my clone in there?
[196:32.26]Move out onto the platform.
[196:34.96]You step onto the stone platform and feel curiously lighter.
[196:40.07]Check my package.
[196:44.42]You check your pack, but all your possessions are as you left them.
[196:47.36]Instead, you realize your feet are no longer touching the ground.
[196:50.48]You are floating.
[196:57.24]Let myself fly.
[196:59.28]You fly happily upwards towards the ceiling.
[197:02.67]Where am I?
[197:03.69]What?
[197:05.13]Oh, I thought it was going to take me somewhere else.
[197:08.21]Eventually, you hit the ceiling and gently bounce off.
[197:13.05]Okay, let's Willy Wonka this shit.
[197:16.51]I drank too many fizzy lifting drinks.
[197:19.35]Explore the ceiling.
[197:36.47]With some effort you pull yourself along the roof.
[197:39.15]The room is fairly uniform, broken only by the inverted landscape of rocks.
[197:43.43]Towards the center of the room, you spy a small depression in the ceiling.
[197:49.39]Head toward the center.
[197:52.54]You guide yourself towards the depression in the center of the room.
[197:55.26]Pulling along by the rocks is difficult and you occasionally float off course.
[197:59.44]Below you, the spikes wait, but thankfully they are well out of reach.
[198:04.30]Arriving at the center, you see that there has been a small circle cut into the ceiling and inside someone has carved a sigil into the stone.
[198:12.51]Look at the sigil.
[198:14.69]You swing over to look into the depression at the sigil, but you cannot stay still long enough to see it properly.
[198:23.55]You Bob past the opening and away a short distance across the ceiling.
[198:29.22]Try again and look at the sigil.
[198:36.40]What?
[198:37.38]Why can I not see this?
[198:46.06]Rock?
[198:47.89]Turn to stone?
[198:51.17]Wouldn't I just drop to the spikes?
[199:00.48]Six.
[199:01.68]Oh, we're gonna make a chain.
[199:02.68]It's gonna be perfect.
[199:04.72]Six.
[199:06.77]Alright.
[199:08.75]You cast the enchantment and five clones step out from behind you, forming a semicircle.
[199:12.65]Your clones spring into existence, all floating as you are.
[199:16.03]They spread out, searching the room.
[199:18.15]From the center of the room, one of your clones waves and points silently.
[199:21.91]You Bob over to the clone.
[199:24.07]He is in the exact center of the room where a small depression sits in the ceiling.
[199:27.27]As you move to take a closer look, your clone fades away as the spell expires.
[199:31.57]What?
[199:37.23]What the fuck?
[199:37.61]I thought we could, like, make a human chain and hold on to each other.
[199:47.29]Well, that didn't work.
[199:50.19]Hey, look what I found!
[199:51.35]Yeah, I found that already, idiot.
[199:53.05]You stupid clone.
[199:58.27]Should I do... Fix.
[200:00.94]Cause fixness.
[200:01.98]I don't have it.
[200:05.30]I don't have it.
[200:12.90]I don't have it.
[200:14.86]That's what I have to do.
[200:18.41]Try again to look at the sigil.
[200:23.21]Unless you can find a way to stay still, you're not going to be able to see it properly.
[200:26.23]The depression is too shadowy for a click glimpse.
[200:28.35]God damn it.
[200:32.75]Rock is going to turn me into a stone and I'm going to fall into the spikes.
[200:43.51]Float in air.
[200:48.45]Okay.
[200:53.34]Okay.
[201:00.39]I'm gonna do rockets.
[201:16.58]Oh, that's such a dumb idea.
[201:24.24]Here's the thing.
[201:24.80]I might die, but I might be able to see the depression.
[201:30.69]Can't hurt somebody if they're a rock.
[201:37.19]That is kind of true.
[201:38.07]I might be fine.
[201:41.51]What's my fate?
[201:44.45]Now that I...
[201:51.64]We're doing it.
[201:52.38]Fuck it.
[201:52.62]I don't even care.
[201:59.78]It's done.
[202:00.19]I did it.
[202:03.81]Looking at the constellations, you craft a spell, tossing out a handful of stone dust.
[202:07.31]Unlike you, the dust does not float, spiraling instead down towards the spike pit.
[202:13.32]But as it falls, your limbs begin to feel heavier.
[202:15.92]Your body lurches once in the air, dropping a few feet.
[202:20.15]I just, like, threw some rocks into the... Catch myself.
[202:26.96]Fucking goddammit.
[202:37.69]I, like, I figured maybe I'd be able to look at it and then fall because I could get the depression.
[202:44.17]You reach out madly, but there are no handholds nearby.
[202:46.43]You hang, twisting an empty space.
[202:48.65]You find yourself upside down, staring at the pinprick thin spikes clustered together.
[202:53.40]Your hair floats about you, but then you see it begin to settle, wilting slowly, and it hangs down.
[202:58.58]And that's when you really fall.
[202:59.92]As you hurtle towards the spikes, you reflect, momentarily, that the spell of lightness opposes the enchantment of petrification.
[203:05.72]What's my fate?
[203:06.30]You have been impaled on spikes.
[203:11.84]Just had to know.
[203:13.08]Just needed to know.
[203:20.00]Just needed to know.
[203:26.90]Counter sad.
[203:32.67]Let's try and just go in the front door.
[203:33.91]I'm a guard now, right?
[203:34.77]Let's give that a try.
[203:41.02]Because technically I'm a guard.
[203:46.14]Uh-huh.
[203:46.72]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[203:47.24]Make a move.
[203:50.58]This is too dark.
[203:51.32]Let's impale myself.
[203:54.80]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[203:55.68]Okay, the north road.
[203:56.46]I'm dressed as a guard.
[203:57.40]They shouldn't chase me now.
[203:58.42]I should be able to do whatever I want here.
[204:02.27]A group of guards block the road.
[204:04.31]Make a move.
[204:06.41]Approach the guards.
[204:08.09]Last time I was a monk and they said get out of here, but I'm... You walk up to greet the guards.
[204:13.99]Taken in by your disguise, the guards give you a sharp salute.
[204:17.66]Alright, one asks.
[204:21.57]Return the salute.
[204:23.40]You return the salute smartly and the others nod.
[204:25.84]Just then a passing beggar stumbles into the guard.
[204:28.94]Watch it!
[204:29.58]She yells and shoves him aside.
[204:31.44]The beggar, clearly drunk, mumbles an apology.
[204:34.50]Not good enough!
[204:35.76]The guard snarls, advancing on him.
[204:40.88]Hold the guard.
[204:42.16]No.
[204:44.04]Unfortunately, I gotta play the part.
[204:47.80]So, yeah.
[204:49.04]Encourage her.
[204:50.73]You encourage her, cheering the woman on as she beats the beggar senseless.
[204:54.08]He eventually crawls away, and by that point, the guard is laughing.
[204:59.16]Well, you are an alright sort.
[205:01.42]Go on, go on through.
[205:02.86]And if I see you in the mess hall, we'll down a flagon or two.
[205:08.11]Yeah, unfortunately, I had to do that terrible act of inhumane nonsense.
[205:14.95]My disguise would be, you know, obviously.
[205:18.51]Some might call me a monster, but
[205:21.06]You know, chaotic good.
[205:23.30]Chaotic good.
[205:25.40]You continue climbing up the north road.
[205:27.22]Move on.
[205:30.06]Top of the road.
[205:30.48]See, last time I was being chased here and I got grabbed right here, so we're in here completely legally.
[205:38.78]Uh, just open the door.
[205:40.56]Oh, the door's locked.
[205:41.68]Try a key.
[205:43.18]You try your keys and turn, to your delight, the oily key that you found in the room of the mucolictic
[205:49.60]Turns in the lock.
[205:50.64]Then you slip in through the small door and close it behind you once more.
[205:54.64]In the guard encampment.
[205:57.34]Okay.
[205:59.10]You pass through the door, leaving the crowded spaces of Man Pang City behind you and entering a narrow alleyway.
[206:04.39]Walls stretch high on either side.
[206:06.65]The feel is suddenly that of a fortress, tightly managed and harsh, growing like a fungus on the outside of the central tower.
[206:13.69]There will be no way back now.
[206:15.73]The moon sets.
[206:16.85]More stars appear.
[206:20.22]Keep my head down.
[206:21.42]It would be unwise to like, oh, let's look around like it's fucking Disney World.
[206:25.94]You keep your head bowed low under your plumed helmet.
[206:28.92]They're looking for you, most likely, and anyone here could be willing to turn you in.
[206:32.79]The casual cruelty of this place will only grow worse.
[206:35.57]You are entering the hornet's nest now.
[206:38.65]The alleyway runs to the right, but on the left is a low iron doorway.
[206:42.31]The door down to the city is closed, but not locked.
[206:46.95]Let's move on.
[206:48.89]Okay.
[206:51.27]Now, I've been over here, right?
[206:54.01]Let's go left.
[206:56.71]Low door.
[206:58.63]Chaotic neutral?
[207:00.53]I'm not even sure what I would be.
[207:01.89]I think I'm chaotic good.
[207:04.45]You know, for the playthrough.
[207:07.30]But then again, I did try to burn a bunch of villages to the ground for no reason because I just felt like doing it.
[207:12.20]So, you know, maybe I am chaotic evil or chaotic good.
[207:15.22]I don't think I'm inherently evil, though.
[207:19.40]You stand by a solid metal door set into the stone wall.
[207:22.12]You don't fancy your chances of breaking it down.
[207:25.12]The voice of Throf enters your mind.
[207:27.30]Turn back, the goddess declares.
[207:29.24]What lies beyond is a truly evil place.
[207:31.44]Okay.
[207:38.74]Well, Throf does not like the idea of me coming over here.
[207:44.24]Do I listen to my goddess or do I just go in?
[207:52.27]Uh, what can I do for spells here?
[207:55.59]Nice high chaos run.
[208:01.14]Tell?
[208:01.58]I could read minds.
[208:03.48]Whatever's behind that door, I could see what it is and what they're thinking.
[208:07.10]I'm gonna do that.
[208:07.60]That seems like something I could do.
[208:10.56]No stamina required.
[208:12.04]Read the minds.
[208:14.39]There's nobody in here.
[208:14.91]So why is she so concerned about this?
[208:15.74]Uh... Six.
[208:15.90]Six.
[208:16.00]Let's go!
[208:41.31]You cast a spell and five clones step up from behind you, forming a semicircle.
[208:45.32]Open the door.
[208:45.88]Let's go.
[208:48.46]Working together with your clones, you haul open the door.
[208:51.10]A short, wide corridor is in front of you, but there is no sign of any guard.
[208:57.07]Alright, send the clones in first.
[209:00.25]You order your clones to go in ahead of you.
[209:02.35]They fan out to fill the corridor and advance slowly.
[209:06.27]Keep watching.
[209:08.19]You keep watching.
[209:09.29]A moment later, a trap is triggered.
[209:11.53]All those except the ones by the left wall are slammed into smoke by a large spiked flail that descends from the ceiling.
[209:19.12]The trap ratchets back into a hidden slot in the roof.
[209:25.61]Very nice work, clones!
[209:27.95]You did it!
[209:30.25]Excellent work!
[209:34.43]Walk forwards.
[209:37.34]You make your way cautiously forward.
[209:38.80]The middle of the room seems very exposed, but the walls might be set with any number of hidden traps.
[209:44.52]The left wall.
[209:53.11]Hug the left wall.
[209:57.49]As you walk down the corridor, you hug the left wall as you were told to.
[210:01.78]By what?
[210:02.08]One of my guys was like, take the left wall!
[210:05.63]Halfway down, a huge flail swings down from a hidden chain, filling the rest of the corridor.
[210:10.29]You hear a resounding laugh echoing from a chamber through a low arch at the far end.
[210:14.82]Oh, this motherfucker is dead.
[210:21.64]This motherfucker is dead, whoever is down here.
[210:26.73]Oh, you're fucked.
[210:30.00]You duck through an archway and nearly gag from the stench.
[210:33.26]Dried blood paints the walls and floor, and scattered around the room are grisly instruments of torture.
[210:40.30]Standing in the middle of the room is a bowed, ugly ogre with a huge grin and a dozen scars.
[210:46.16]He wears a ragged black hood and carries a whip.
[210:50.91]Enjoy my surprise.
[210:59.11]Oh, hold on a minute.
[211:05.32]Should I, like, pretend to, like... I feel like I should pretend to be like, what are you talking about?
[211:12.60]What surprise?
[211:13.13]What do you mean?
[211:16.65]What surprise?
[211:20.65]I hope you're not a stupid one.
[211:22.93]No fun in that.
[211:25.89]Who are you?
[211:27.60]He peers at you.
[211:29.92]You don't know?
[211:31.66]Well, now.
[211:33.48]And who's to youse?
[211:36.77]I'm a new guard.
[211:38.11]He looks you up and down.
[211:39.92]So you are.
[211:42.86]What you want anyways?
[211:46.66]I'm here to release your prisoners.
[211:52.61]Prisoners?
[211:53.93]I don't have any prisoners here.
[211:55.93]This isn't a jail.
[211:57.93]You fucking idiot.
[212:00.66]Where are the cells?
[212:02.66]Pass the commander's office.
[212:06.62]The other pass.
[212:07.94]Don't waste my time.
[212:09.96]He starts to bustle you towards the door.
[212:12.71]Wait, wait, tell me about the throbbing doors.
[212:16.65]Say they're trash with spells.
[212:19.89]Nagamanta.
[212:21.07]That's his name.
[212:23.59]Can't we open this without killing you?
[212:26.26]You waste no more time in this horrible place.
[212:30.76]Wait, what did he just say?
[212:33.14]Can't be opened without killing you.
[212:36.92]So the throbendoors will kill me.
[212:41.25]Sure.
[212:45.85]That guy actually tortured my guy to death when I played.
[212:48.93]I didn't know you could escape.
[212:51.05]I was trying to kill Jerma in this one, to be honest.
[212:56.30]Well, I'm a city guard.
[212:57.48]Do you have the guard costume?
[213:02.03]six how many clones have died just in the last like three and a half hours at least probably 20. you didn't die this is not my plan while I escaped with my life the sky is beginning to look warm okay move on let's keep on going down the alley oh it's okay
[213:30.78]I apparently have been awake all night.
[213:38.03]Fuck.
[213:39.07]Not good.
[213:40.87]You make your way along the alley, keeping your gaze low.
[213:42.87]Luckily, you pass no one.
[213:44.45]This area seems quite dead.
[213:46.39]It must be morning by now.
[213:47.93]You've been awake all night, and you're a dumbass for not finding a place to sleep.
[213:51.61]What a bad player.
[213:53.33]Here's four stamina deleted from your character.
[213:56.17]You pass a low wooden door, though.
[213:58.85]Look at the door.
[214:01.27]The door is unmarked and appears unlocked.
[214:03.68]The wood is warped in rain sodden.
[214:08.70]Make a move.
[214:11.36]Let's go in this room.
[214:14.48]The door opens easily and you step inside.
[214:16.63]The stone walls form a cool, quiet space.
[214:20.09]I probably could have slept in here.
[214:23.55]This was clearly someone's quarters once, but they have long since cleared out, leaving nothing behind but a dent in the straw that lines the wall.
[214:31.42]Look in the straw.
[214:36.04]You hunt through the straw little than pull your hand back sharply as something bites you.
[214:40.25]You look down at your fingers to see two large red welts growing on your forearm.
[214:44.57]If that is a rat bite, then so be it.
[214:47.27]But if it's a spider, it could be quite serious.
[214:51.08]Stab the straw with my sword.
[214:54.99]You stab the straw a few times and after a moment, a yellow striped snake slithers out and darts away across the stones and under the door.
[215:02.46]Time to move on.
[215:03.20]Hey, remember I said three stamina?
[215:04.42]Now I have one.
[215:08.46]You return to the alley.
[215:09.36]The bite on your hand itches furiously, but then the welts begin to fade once more.
[215:16.97]Good room.
[215:19.61]Good thing I didn't go to sleep there.
[215:21.01]I probably would be dead.
[215:23.85]The alley turns slightly here, following the curve of the cliff.
[215:26.59]At the far end you spot two birdman guards standing by an iron door.
[215:30.86]They've either not noticed you or your disguise is keeping you safe.
[215:34.28]Another narrow door is on the right, a little further along the alley.
[215:37.38]The air is cold, icy but fresh.
[215:39.56]It would be a good idea to not stand around too long in case your disguise does not hold up.
[215:45.31]Inwards.
[215:47.97]You head towards the next door in the alleyway.
[215:49.49]The guards at the far end of the alley take no notice.
[215:52.71]Look at the door.
[215:54.52]The door is about chest height and is hanging open.
[215:57.28]A small bell with a pull string is set above it.
[216:04.60]Ring the bell.
[216:06.64]You pull on the string and the bell rings gently.
[216:09.38]There are some scuffing sounds from within.
[216:13.67]Wait.
[216:15.17]After a few seconds, the door opens a fraction more.
[216:18.87]Well, come in then.
[216:21.29]You can't see who is speaking, but they have a very squeaky voice.
[216:25.29]I hope it's a rat.
[216:26.09]Please be a rat.
[216:29.33]Ducking to enter, you discover that everything in this room is tiny.
[216:32.75]Chairs at knee height, a three foot long bed, and ceiling to match.
[216:39.11]Precariously sitting on one of the chairs is either a very small ogre or a hairless, ugly dwarf.
[216:47.19]Greet it.
[216:48.45]Greetings, you declare.
[216:50.83]The creature blinks twice and turns its head, finally noticing you.
[216:55.27]Well, come to laugh?
[216:57.51]You guards are all the same.
[217:01.11]Come to laugh?
[217:01.67]Why would I laugh?
[217:03.63]I'm not stupid, you know.
[217:05.11]People think I am, but I'm not.
[217:06.93]Bah!
[217:08.37]Looking at the room, you notice how disproportionate the creature is.
[217:11.41]It is far too large for the tiny furniture.
[217:14.00]Even though it's small, the room appears designed to make it seem like a giant.
[217:20.80]I'm not going to laugh at you.
[217:22.96]The small creature looks at you with wonder.
[217:26.01]Why not?
[217:28.59]You're not funny.
[217:30.63]Is it wrong?
[217:31.19]I don't get it.
[217:34.83]Why would I?
[217:36.27]It gives a hollow laugh.
[217:39.01]Everyone else seems to find reason enough.
[217:45.03]Who are you?
[217:46.57]Nibdim.
[217:47.87]I'm here because the Archmage finds my condition amusing.
[217:52.59]Condition?
[217:53.73]It grimaces.
[217:54.78]I'm a mutant.
[217:55.74]A failed experiment.
[217:59.68]Created by the Archmage.
[218:01.40]It's Scowls.
[218:04.76]The Archmage was trying to cross ogres and dwarves.
[218:07.72]He wanted something strong and loyal as an ogre, but small enough to fit into the mines.
[218:14.81]You don't look like a miner, you point out.
[218:17.47]The creature rolls its eyes.
[218:19.23]I'm not.
[218:20.35]The crossbreeding left me weak.
[218:22.37]I can't even lift a pickaxe, let alone swing one.
[218:27.58]Do you know the Archmage?
[218:29.80]I just, I'm doing his fucking voice now.
[218:32.08]Do you know the Archmage?
[218:33.94]Hardly.
[218:35.12]He's the one who forces me to live in this pint-sized room, though he rarely visits.
[218:41.88]I heard a rumor the arc page was dead.
[218:44.63]Nibdom shakes his head.
[218:47.87]No, he's not dead.
[218:49.51]But he sleeps a lot.
[218:51.30]Several years ago, sometimes.
[218:53.88]That's how old he's... Ah, he fucked up the whole thing.
[218:56.60]Let's start over.
[218:57.62]Nibdim shakes his head.
[218:58.88]No, he's not dead.
[219:01.04]But he sleeps a lot.
[219:03.11]Several years and ago, sometimes.
[219:06.17]That's how he's so old.
[219:08.37]There's magic to it, of course.
[219:10.57]But he's been awake recently.
[219:12.17]He's plotting something.
[219:16.93]I've heard the throw-open doors are hard to open.
[219:19.67]The mutant shrugs awkwardly.
[219:21.35]It's just a door.
[219:22.69]The problem is the traps.
[219:24.77]Magical traps.
[219:28.32]The passage outside ends in a door.
[219:31.36]Just walk through.
[219:32.98]You're a guard, aren't you?
[219:35.42]Thanks for the chat.
[219:37.08]I don't get to talk to many people these days.
[219:39.76]It stays in its chair, smiling ever so slightly.
[219:45.73]Okay.
[219:47.13]The alley.
[219:48.33]Magical traps.
[219:52.65]Alley's end.
[219:55.45]Traps?
[219:56.79]Southern ogre.
[219:57.67]Oh, the magical traps.
[219:59.45]You're nearing the end of the alleyway and the guarded iron door.
[220:02.44]Another narrow, rather narrow door is nearby.
[220:08.32]Listen at the narrow door.
[220:10.14]Leaning over to press your ear against the narrow door, you hear high-pitched murmurs through the old wood.
[220:17.60]Slip inside.
[220:18.90]Moving quickly, you slip inside the door.
[220:21.56]The low room.
[220:24.47]Uh-oh.
[220:25.59]You close the door behind you, glad to be away from the guard's prying eyes.
[220:29.11]The chamber you enter is rough, as though carved from a spur of rock.
[220:32.99]The ceiling is open to the sky.
[220:35.17]But as you enter, three birdmen look up from their dice game.
[220:40.89]Staring at you intently, you're reminded of an Aniland phrase, hiding from Snattercats in a stranglebush.
[220:57.54]Shit, it's three.
[220:58.20]Birdman, greet them.
[220:59.90]I'm a guard.
[221:01.66]Greetings.
[221:02.92]The birds continue to stare dumbfounded.
[221:08.08]Stand up, soldiers.
[221:09.18]Ask for directions to the guard, Commander.
[221:12.78]Cast a spell.
[221:14.56]You open your arms to cast a spell.
[221:16.04]The birdman whacks your elbow painfully with his halberd.
[221:19.49]Not a chance.
[221:21.25]One of the silent ones points at you, and as he lifts his arm, you notice a curious SS-shaped mark under his arm.
[221:30.33]Oh, Jesus.
[221:33.13]Ask about the mark.
[221:35.22]What does that mark on your arm?
[221:36.90]What does that mark on your arm?
[221:38.16]I, Tarzan.
[221:39.88]An injury from killing humans.
[221:49.34]Uh, ask for directions to the guard commander.
[221:53.89]Answer me, you begin.
[221:55.07]Which way is the commander's office?
[221:58.13]And why would you need to know that?
[222:02.47]The bourbon replies, curiously clacking a talon against the table.
[222:07.63]I want to avoid the commander.
[222:08.88]I'm a spy, reporting back.
[222:10.44]It's not your business.
[222:14.38]All these are bad.
[222:15.06]I'm a spy, reporting back.
[222:20.24]I want to avoid the commander.
[222:23.04]I want to avoid the commander, you reply with a sly smile.
[222:27.84]The bourbon pause a moment, then laugh.
[222:32.76]Everyone has something to hide.
[222:34.80]The commander's office is through the iron way at the end of this hall.
[222:39.46]I suggest you turn back to the lower city.
[222:42.28]There's nothing but guards around up here.
[222:49.90]Let me pass.
[222:52.74]The birdmen look down their beaks at you.
[222:54.71]They do not move.
[223:00.69]I have one stamina.
[223:01.85]Leave.
[223:03.89]Well, I'll be leaving.
[223:06.67]The Birdmen stare, but do not make a move to stop you.
[223:08.96]You exit the room, grateful for the stupidity of the Archmage's troops.
[223:17.36]I'm gonna die down here.
[223:21.45]Size up the guards.
[223:22.37]There's guards here, right?
[223:24.25]You cast a sidelong glance at the guards by the far door, sizing them up.
[223:27.71]They are Birdmen.
[223:29.11]Tall, strong, with savage-clawed talons and beaks like pickaxes.
[223:33.21]One is missing a wing.
[223:35.84]They have seen you, but do not approach or call out.
[223:38.92]Instead, holding to their posts, it is most unnerving.
[223:47.48]I did it!
[223:47.86]I did it!
[223:48.30]I know I did it!
[223:51.22]Look at the iron door.
[223:52.80]The iron door is a large slab guarded by two birdmen.
[223:56.74]They have seen you, but they are not going to react.
[223:58.62]You are in a guard costume.
[224:00.18]This door must lead into the inner fortress proper.
[224:02.78]Beyond the iron door, you can make out movement in the yard beyond.
[224:07.75]The iron door.
[224:11.01]You approach the iron door at the alley's end.
[224:12.91]The two birdman guards stiffen at your approach, gripping their halberds more tightly.
[224:19.70]Walk past.
[224:22.62]I'm a guard, after all.
[224:23.90]You saunter by and reach for the door.
[224:25.94]The halberds snap down into a cross, blocking the way.
[224:31.44]Get out of my way!
[224:33.24]The birdman grips you by the arm.
[224:36.49]I don't like your tone.
[224:43.23]Let me pass!
[224:45.45]Your tone stops them in their tracks.
[224:48.17]Why?
[224:49.44]Who are you?
[224:54.34]I am the Archmage.
[225:03.21]It's me, the Archmage.
[225:07.45]That's a terrible idea, right?
[225:17.43]Get out of my way.
[225:20.67]The Birdman grips you by the arm again.
[225:24.24]I don't like your tone.
[225:26.02]Okay, now I'm just like, what the fuck?
[225:28.04]I'm like overdoing that.
[225:29.84]I don't like your tone.
[225:32.30]Insult her, offer a bribe.
[225:33.78]I have, I have, I have, I have 36 gold pieces.
[225:41.17]I can make it worth your while.
[225:43.95]The vermin looks nervously at his companion.
[225:47.85]Well?
[225:50.13]He trails off.
[225:51.68]The Bird Maid's only response is to narrow her eyes.
[225:54.01]Okay, well, well, Birdman.
[225:58.57]Bribe the Birdman.
[226:00.43]You open your pack, and the Birdman leans forward and rifles through it, holding items up to the light.
[226:05.81]The Birdmaid looks on in disgust.
[226:08.11]Eventually, he grabs the Orb of Crystal.
[226:11.21]This will do nicely.
[226:16.43]The Birdmane is getting increasingly agitated.
[226:19.25]You shouldn't be taking bribes, she says.
[226:22.64]You shut your mouth!
[226:24.24]The Birdmane hisses back.
[226:28.64]Bah.
[226:34.01]That's a very important item.
[226:48.53]Why don't you shut it for him?
[226:52.08]Why don't you shut it for him?
[226:55.18]What are you starting?
[226:56.28]Demands the Birdman.
[226:57.84]Then the Birdmaid leaps, the two grapples slashing at each other with their talons.
[227:02.52]The Birdman suffers a deep gash, but manages a lucky strike that knocks her out.
[227:07.30]Fuck.
[227:07.96]Then he turns to you, furious and bleeding.
[227:11.56]What are you looking at?
[227:15.13]Knock him down.
[227:17.26]You waste no time in further discussion.
[227:18.69]This guy's fucking dead.
[227:20.95]Good job.
[227:21.45]You're the winner.
[227:22.09]You get to lose to my extremely powerful weapon.
[227:27.73]Yeah, I don't even waste any time.
[227:28.69]Full blast again.
[227:29.33]Nice.
[227:31.87]Oh, look at this strong bird man.
[227:33.81]Do it again.
[227:34.15]Oh, what's that?
[227:37.43]Flawless fighting instantly dead?
[227:42.62]Yeah.
[227:43.72]Yeah.
[227:44.10]Alright, let's go.
[227:47.11]The Birdman dies with a shrill chirp.
[227:52.22]Hold on.
[227:59.73]This is it.
[228:00.75]This is the bird dying.
[228:01.99]This is the bird dying.
[228:03.56]I have to do it one more time.
[228:23.41]I did it far away from the mic.
[228:30.68]Far enough away.
[228:37.89]You've paid your toll in blood.
[228:41.05]What an actor.
[228:41.63]I like that.
[228:41.99]Come on, give me some round of applause.
[228:43.09]That was acting.
[228:50.31]With the way clear, you head through the iron door and close it behind you.
[228:53.37]I win.
[228:57.43]Let's go.
[228:59.37]Into the courtyard.
[229:01.43]Look, I'm not gonna be able to do that again.
[229:03.53]Right?
[229:03.71]That was my- It said a shrill chirp.
[229:06.67]Not gonna be able to fucking do that noise again.
[229:10.17]Obviously, that's- I'm gonna do it.
[229:11.77]Now you guys don't ever have to hear it again.
[229:16.71]Alright, you emerge from the iron door.
[229:17.77]The sun bakes the ground.
[229:18.87]This is the east side of a wide courtyard that sits below the sorcerer's spike of Mampang.
[229:23.67]Guards mill this way and that.
[229:25.99]A short distance away, a wide set of steps lead up to the tower doors.
[229:29.95]The iron doors lead south out of the courtyard, and a door leads away into a nearby turret.
[229:36.19]Hmm.
[229:39.95]Let me just take a look at this area.
[229:48.21]Why would you want to do it in the first place?
[229:49.63]Because it's supposed to be like a bird, man.
[229:53.29]It's a bird man.
[229:55.45]Jerma, I hate you.
[229:56.56]End this stream.
[229:57.24]Alright, well, fuck off.
[230:01.78]What do you want me to say?
[230:05.28]That's the only response I can give to that.
[230:06.90]Sorry.
[230:10.50]Alright, let's go.
[230:13.52]Let's make a move.
[230:17.40]Alright, the steps to the Sorcerer's Spike are right in front of you.
[230:20.27]There is nothing stopping you climbing them and taking a look at the Throben doors for yourself.
[230:24.75]The door is marked Commander's Office.
[230:27.67]Cool.
[230:31.83]I hate you, Throben.
[230:35.13]Bye.
[230:35.85]Two second, man.
[230:37.53]Yeah, if you talk like that, you're going to get banned for life.
[230:41.08]And getting banned for life is, if you're new to the stream, it's about 10 seconds.
[230:51.72]Alright, so we go to the commander.
[230:53.21]I'm dressed as the commander.
[230:55.15]That doesn't sound like a good idea.
[231:02.67]This is the chopper.
[231:03.41]Remember I was here last time?
[231:04.49]This is the chopping block.
[231:05.25]This is where I get my head cut off.
[231:13.68]That's a bad idea.
[231:14.94]I'm going to go in the courtyard.
[231:17.98]Ban me for life.
[231:22.82]I'm obviously kidding right if by the way if you're new to this if you're new to the stream I like when I say like off and get banned for life it's a joke it's a joke don't worry I love you all even if you don't like me I don't even care I love you still who cares alright you step out in the center of the square trusting to your disguise to keep you safe thick oily smells drift from a building to the north
[231:47.86]But the most impressive sight here is the deep, towering flight of steps that leads up towards a door and the inner tower itself.
[231:54.46]On the other side of the yard is a familiar large block of wood.
[232:00.65]It's just a joke.
[232:05.25]Uh, look at the steps.
[232:06.99]The steps are wide, black slabs of stone carved with ornate symbols.
[232:11.15]They rise steeply enough that one could not run up them, and a shorter man than you might have to scramble.
[232:17.50]Ugh...
[232:48.35]Jerma's filled with too much- No, I- Look, here's the thing.
[232:51.71]I know that some people might come to the stream and hear me make a fucking screeching re-birdman noise and be like, this guy sucks.
[233:00.58]Look, I completely understand.
[233:03.32]Trust me, I get it.
[233:06.35]I respect your opinion.
[233:10.57]But that's not going to stop me from making bird noises.
[233:12.65]It's not.
[233:15.23]You know what I mean?
[233:22.63]You're into the middle part of the day, and yet the Citadel is still cold.
[233:25.87]You approach a large, noisy building.
[233:28.75]It is the guards' mess hall.
[233:30.59]Ooh, free food.
[233:32.93]The building is large, with one side open to the elements.
[233:35.15]Inside, tables are packed with guards of all stripes.
[233:38.91]Okay, cool.
[233:41.73]I'm dressed as a captain, not a commander.
[233:43.12]Okay.
[233:44.78]Makes sense.
[233:48.30]He thinks Paper Mario sucks.
[233:51.17]Peek inside the hall.
[233:52.83]Beastmen, orcs, and humans all hunt over bowls of stew.
[233:56.26]They're also scattered around the mess hall, staggering with drink.
[233:59.52]Serving goblins rush to and fro, avoiding the kicks and jeers of guards.
[234:03.63]You could try entering the mess hall and hope your disguise holds.
[234:08.63]Why wouldn't it?
[234:10.15]And hopefully I get some food.
[234:16.79]Oh, here we go.
[234:17.15]Here comes the guy.
[234:17.71]Oh, I love this one.
[234:19.53]This random sound clip of the guy that goes... Inside the hall.
[234:30.27]You stride into the mess hall, which is crowded with guards.
[234:33.40]It falls silent the moment that you enter.
[234:35.94]A man looks up at you.
[234:37.98]Captain, are you?
[234:39.16]He demands, looking you up and down.
[234:41.66]Indeed.
[234:48.91]These laughs are gonna fuck me up.
[234:51.53]Indeed, new to this district.
[234:54.03]Funny.
[234:55.25]Would have thought someone might have told me.
[234:57.73]With a sinking feeling, you realize who this man is.
[235:00.55]He is the captain here, and he has no doubt seen straight through your disguise.
[235:09.21]You laugh, the captain laughs, you all laugh, then he flicks with a hunk of bread in your direction.
[235:15.97]Get him!
[235:20.07]A crowd of guards rush toward you!
[235:22.21]You cannot hope to defeat them in combat!
[235:30.39]What do I got?
[235:33.08]Oh, I already know!
[235:34.18]I already know what I'm doing!
[235:36.52]Jig!
[235:37.64]Cause lively dancing!
[235:42.34]Start dancing!
[235:44.86]Pulling the pipe from your pack, you weave your enchantment.
[235:46.82]There is a moment when you wonder if the spell can work on such a large crowd, but it would appear this was a crowd inclined towards dancing already, as they quickly break out into a stomping, wheeling dance that sprawls into the mess hall.
[235:59.78]Keep playing.
[236:01.59]You keep playing, and the sight and sound is like nothing you have seen on your travels so far.
[236:06.31]The guards dance as though they have never in their lives danced before, as if nothing in their lives to follow mattered either.
[236:13.25]Keep playing.
[236:15.08]The guards whirl around the floor, knocking over tables and chairs.
[236:18.86]A few have coupled off to dance in pairs.
[236:21.58]One guard is kissing another guard passionately, their helmets clashing in time to your wild melody.
[236:28.53]All is abandoned and chaos and beauty.
[236:31.79]It is a sight like Man Pang has most likely not seen in centuries, if ever before.
[236:37.17]Keep playing.
[236:39.57]You continue to play, but the guards are tiring now.
[236:42.61]One by one, they drop from the dance.
[236:44.57]The spell has long since faded.
[236:46.47]What keeps them going now comes entirely from their own hearts.
[236:49.84]You almost laugh out loud.
[236:51.72]You've made it inside the mess hall.
[236:53.96]As the floor finally empties, you look around a room of smiling faces.
[236:58.28]A guard beckons you to him by the fire.
[237:04.02]They're not even on the spell.
[237:05.26]They're, like, happy.
[237:07.16]Wait, hold on.
[237:07.64]Are they gonna, like, jump me again?
[237:17.14]Uh, should I?
[237:21.45]I'm gonna go do it.
[237:23.23]You sit down near the roaring fire, surrounded by guards of all stripes.
[237:30.25]Alright.
[237:32.55]The guards by the fire are sitting in muted silence.
[237:35.46]A short, dark-haired guard is singing in a beautiful, rich voice, a pure, gentle lullaby that is seemingly directed at a sheep.
[237:46.81]You laugh, but a few of the guards silence you.
[237:49.25]It seems the song is an ancient, much-loved tune here in Mampang.
[237:54.36]Gentle ram, lay your head, croons the guard.
[237:57.68]The flames in the grate seem to dance in time to the melody, and you find yourself nearly nodding off as you listen.
[238:04.70]Finally, with something like a sigh, the guard finishes.
[238:07.43]A thoughtful silence descends.
[238:13.29]Ah, shh, stay quiet.
[238:16.21]You do nothing to break the quiet, contemplative mood.
[238:19.29]The singing guards give a short bow.
[238:21.72]A traveler taught me that.
[238:23.54]I always thought it was beautiful.
[238:25.80]Another guard punches him on the arm.
[238:28.04]You're as soft as fresh bread you are.
[238:31.48]A third hands him a cup of ale.
[238:37.80]Uh, I'm gonna rest.
[238:39.42]I need stamina.
[238:41.67]You take advantage of the comradely quiet to enjoy the fire and rest of your aching bones.
[238:48.11]Around you, the guards talk quietly.
[238:50.35]For a moment, this quiet, warm corner of Mampang seems almost welcoming.
[238:58.44]I'm going to talk to the singing guard.
[239:01.40]You approach the singer, who is resting with his feet beside the fire, sipping his ale thoughtfully.
[239:07.08]You have a fine voice.
[239:09.57]Perhaps I do.
[239:10.65]What of it?
[239:12.59]You could be a musician.
[239:14.67]No, I couldn't.
[239:15.99]I was born to be a guard, so a guard is what I am.
[239:20.84]Okay.
[239:21.84]You nod and stand once more.
[239:23.54]The guard drinks deeply from his beer mug, then gets to his feet.
[239:27.82]I'd best patrol if I'm going to patrol.
[239:30.18]He wobbles slightly and the others laugh, then he leaves the hall.
[239:35.09]Ask someone about the tower.
[239:37.67]You tap the arm of the guard next to you.
[239:40.15]What can you tell me about the tower, you ask.
[239:43.70]What, the sorcerer's spike?
[239:45.95]What's to know?
[239:49.69]Does the Archmage ever come out?
[239:53.25]Why are you asking me?
[239:54.77]I've never seen him, thank Red.
[239:56.84]They say if you see him, he takes your youth.
[239:59.90]You don't get older, but you forget your childhood.
[240:05.60]Is there any other way in apart from the doors?
[240:09.34]The birdmen go in and out using the windows, of course.
[240:12.12]You could grow wings.
[240:13.97]You nod and smile to the guard who turns back to the fire.
[240:16.83]You stand and leave the fireside.
[240:18.03]This is supposed to be a mess hall.
[240:21.49]Where can I get some food?
[240:25.50]You walk back into the main part of the hall.
[240:27.18]Order some food.
[240:27.66]There we go.
[240:29.28]You sit in motion over a serving goblin, who deposits a bowl of stew in front of you.
[240:33.66]She cowers away before you can thank her.
[240:36.42]The food is nourishing and warm, no one asks for money.
[240:39.78]The ale flows freely here, and many guards are gambling, laughing, or close to blows.
[240:46.66]The mess hall is crowded with guards more like an army than a city watch.
[240:50.01]The tables are slowly being righted again after the dancing.
[240:54.67]Fooled by your disguise, a few nod or wave as you pass.
[240:58.71]I gotta get the hell out of here.
[241:00.17]You head for the exit.
[241:00.97]I had some food.
[241:01.71]I gotta get out of here.
[241:04.43]I'm gonna get jumped again.
[241:08.76]Outside the mess, the silence of the mountains descends.
[241:10.78]A few guards march this way and that.
[241:12.96]The sun lowers towards the horizon.
[241:14.86]You move away from the mess hall door.
[241:19.04]The steps.
[241:22.34]You make your way to the base of the great steps that lead up to the sorcerer's spike.
[241:26.57]The sun has almost set, and the sky has turned a deep purple.
[241:30.03]It will be night soon.
[241:34.35]Look around.
[241:35.79]The steps are wide and central.
[241:37.45]You have a view across the whole of the guard's courtyard and are equally visible.
[241:43.90]You lift your eyes upwards to the famous throbin doors that protect the archmage from mampang, or the other way around perhaps.
[241:51.46]You've been told that they are guarded by spells.
[241:54.17]You steel yourself for great danger.
[241:57.78]Cast a spell.
[241:58.90]I'm curious.
[242:03.82]Jig is such a great spell.
[242:08.18]Like, so far, let's talk about, like, spells in this game.
[242:11.95]The most useful spell in the whole game, I think, is Yaz.
[242:15.47]Which is the invisibility one.
[242:18.15]Yaz, uh, whatever it is.
[242:19.57]Invisibility, Jig, the dancing one, and probably, like, Sense Danger.
[242:26.24]Are, like, super useful.
[242:30.57]Um... How much stamina do I have?
[242:34.41]Oh, fuck it, let's just go.
[242:36.09]Your heart is in your mouth, the inner sanctum lies within reach.
[242:40.84]Climb.
[242:44.84]You make your way, one by one, up the enormous steps.
[242:47.08]The tower looms above you like never before.
[242:49.96]Each step is carved with a word in the oldest tongue, spelling out a message for those who approach the dark heart of Mampang.
[242:57.71]Read the message.
[242:59.74]The message is spelled out one pictographic word at a time, one per step.
[243:04.92]Those who climb must comprehend, enter or else never descend.
[243:11.43]There is something curious about the symbols used, but you cannot put your finger on what it is.
[243:17.09]You steady your nerve and continue to climb by the doors.
[243:23.80]You stand in the dim shade by the colossal doors at the top of the stairs.
[243:27.93]A silence descends, as though this was a quieter corner of the city than any other.
[243:32.69]Perhaps what you have heard is true, and the Archmage truly cannot watch this part of the city.
[243:37.45]Certainly a heavy magic exudes from them.
[243:41.13]Look at the doors.
[243:43.49]They seem simple enough if large.
[243:45.07]The large wooden panels are covered in ornate carvings.
[243:47.89]Someone has left a pack here by the door.
[243:52.54]Look at the pack.
[243:55.18]Perhaps someone else tried to open these doors once.
[243:57.56]The pack lies discarded just to one side of the steps.
[244:00.56]It is a little charred.
[244:04.31]Open the pack.
[244:06.59]Gingerly, you flip open the pack.
[244:08.51]It seems safe enough.
[244:09.81]Inside are a few glass bottles.
[244:13.31]You lift the bottles out one by one, shaking them to identify their contents.
[244:16.43]It's a set of potions.
[244:17.85]Blimberry, blessed water, fire water, and what looks like a poison.
[244:22.61]That's a lot of stuff.
[244:24.23]I will take them.
[244:27.39]You stash each bottle and then step quickly away from the discarded pack.
[244:33.47]Trace the carvings on the door.
[244:36.02]The carvings are of obscene, distorted figures, perhaps once beautiful but now warped and bent by fire.
[244:42.06]In the center is a single vertical stroke.
[244:44.96]One.
[244:48.41]Wait up!
[244:49.21]Wait!
[244:49.93]Wait!
[244:52.69]One.
[244:54.09]You found a glyph one in the Tower of Berries.
[244:56.41]Oh, fuck.
[244:58.77]Glyph two.
[244:59.21]You found a glyph two in the Tower of Statues.
[245:05.58]Tower of Berries?
[245:06.46]What was Berries?
[245:07.06]One.
[245:25.57]I didn't learn what one was, did I?
[245:31.39]How hot?
[245:34.66]Magic?
[245:35.14]No.
[245:41.92]Don't heal disease.
[245:45.47]Was the buried room a fucking disease?
[245:57.47]This is gonna fucking kill me if I touch the door.
[246:04.08]I never figured out what the berries were.
[246:06.76]But I have to imagine, right?
[246:17.11]Zen... Oh god, there's so many options.
[246:25.09]The berry room, I didn't figure out what it was, but it was like... The berries were like rotten.
[246:31.15]Right?
[246:34.29]Goblin.
[246:34.77]Wait, wait, wait.
[246:35.97]Gob.
[246:36.67]Summon a goblin.
[246:41.09]You pull your last goblin tooth from your pack and drop it on the ground, casting your spell across it.
[246:45.45]The tooth erupts into a calling of smoke, and a moment later, a goblin warrior is standing in front of you.
[246:50.05]Go open the door.
[246:52.38]You direct the goblin to the door.
[246:54.38]It nods, scurries forward, and grabs at the handle.
[246:58.18]A moment later, there is nothing before you put a blackened skeleton.
[247:13.47]He's dead.
[247:14.91]He grabbed it and instantly died.
[247:18.16]I just wanted to make sure that if I touched the door, it was going to kill me.
[247:22.35]Fast-boiled flesh.
[247:26.87]Smoky remains of fast-boiled flesh.
[247:29.89]That is absolutely... That has to be Doc.
[247:38.53]And plus, they just gave me this potion two seconds ago.
[247:42.68]This medicinal potion.
[247:43.50]Why would it not be used here?
[247:46.02]Let's go.
[247:46.50]That has to be it.
[247:47.24]It was in the pack!
[247:50.01]You cast a spell across your potion and it begins to glow and fizzle.
[247:58.19]Do I drink it and then go in the door?
[248:06.28]No, it's no, no, no.
[248:07.30]That's like healing me.
[248:09.64]I need to heal the actual door.
[248:11.40]Absolutely.
[248:13.65]The potion sizzles sharply as it slicks across the handle, but it does not boil away in moments as you might have expected.
[248:19.73]After a moment, it seems cool.
[248:23.69]Thank God I was about to fucking drink it.
[248:26.83]Open the door.
[248:27.99]No, hold on.
[248:30.39]Let's, like, tap the handle.
[248:33.54]You reach out and gingerly touch the door handle.
[248:35.44]The metal is cool.
[248:36.82]It seems you have countered the spell of fire inside the door.
[248:40.14]But the door is still not open.
[248:42.13]You've survived one of its traps, but surely there will be more.
[248:45.31]And sure enough, your fingers on the door handle are starting to flake with gray dust.
[248:48.41]You snatch your hand back.
[248:54.20]What?
[249:02.34]Wait a second, wait a second, wait, wait, wait!
[249:10.35]Tower of Statues.
[249:14.42]Tower of Statues was, uh... Glyph 2.
[249:17.72]This is 2!
[249:18.28]This is 2!
[249:21.18]Spell!
[249:21.54]Spell!
[249:21.78]Cast, cast, cast, cast, cast!
[249:27.88]Uh, what is it?
[249:28.64]It's FAL, right?
[249:30.28]Yep.
[249:31.92]Oh, you guys thought I was stupid!
[249:37.60]Looking to the stars, you craft the magic, but although you complete the spell, it seems to have no effect and you do not float into the air as you had expected.
[249:57.48]You look over the door carefully, gaze working from top to bottom.
[250:01.20]The carvings have morphed a little, now showing figures in strange frozen poses.
[250:05.35]Two vertical strokes stand by two.
[250:12.55]I just did it.
[250:21.22]Glyph 2.
[250:23.08]Tower of Statues.
[250:24.11]F.A.L.
[250:28.93]So I just have to do it again?
[250:29.87]Because I... Okay, I get it.
[250:38.07]I have to do it again.
[250:38.71]Once again, it does not take effect.
[250:45.22]Try the door handles.
[250:49.66]Tentatively, you reach out for the door handle, but sure enough, nothing happens.
[250:52.24]It's quite safe.
[251:00.44]But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[251:01.72]No, I don't want to do that, because... Wasn't there another spell?
[251:15.56]The throbbing doors can only be opened by one proficient encounter magic.
[251:20.47]The fourth spell.
[251:22.07]The fourth spell that locks the throbbing doors is a spell of supreme power and force, but no one knows what it is.
[251:25.86]Well, that's great.
[251:27.20]Thanks for the help.
[251:29.74]One of them's invisibility.
[251:35.08]It has to be the third one, right?
[251:41.87]Yeah, this is right here.
[251:43.41]Third, the throbbing door invisibility.
[251:51.81]Should I open it?
[251:52.35]Uh... What counters invisibility?
[251:58.09]Did I learn that?
[252:23.40]Toss something into the passage?
[252:26.18]Should I walk forward?
[252:29.06]Or do I do invisibility?
[252:33.06]I think it is invisibility, right?
[252:50.17]Cause invisibility.
[252:54.19]I'm gonna take a step forward and fucking get electrocuted by something.
[253:07.08]Speed of mind.
[253:09.28]Let me read this again.
[253:16.48]Wait, why is everybody calling me a dumbass?
[253:19.64]How would I know that?
[253:25.70]Like, I'm trying to figure this out.
[253:28.38]Just because you played the game already.
[253:32.14]Come on!
[253:34.15]Let me get a second to think it through.
[253:36.23]Am I playing Dark Souls or am I playing Sorcery?
[253:58.78]I'm gonna read this one more time.
[254:09.47]Third spell at the Throbent Door is Spell of Invisibility.
[254:12.83]So I have to counter Invisibility.
[254:15.41]But I did not learn that counter, so I need to figure out right now what it is!
[254:24.08]The old Jerma would have zapped the door.
[254:31.09]Well, it's definitely not sharpened blade.
[254:34.20]It's definitely not talk all languages.
[254:40.52]It's definitely not resurrected the dead.
[254:48.90]Can't even do teleport.
[255:03.33]Read minds.
[255:09.71]Everyone's like freaking the fuck out.
[255:13.67]Oh my goodness.
[255:18.78]Well, it would make sense for it to be tell.
[255:20.88]It would also make sense for it to be like sense danger.
[255:26.12]Right?
[255:27.74]Or sense anything.
[255:33.49]No, it's not that.
[255:34.43]It's probably tell.
[255:35.31]It's probably tell or sense danger.
[255:37.97]It's definitely not talk all languages.
[255:41.20]Or it could be how.
[255:42.00]No, there's no how either.
[255:47.64]Let's try tell.
[255:48.36]I'm gonna do it.
[255:52.94]Okay.
[255:53.08]Hidden door.
[256:05.22]Just cast what the chat tells you to cast.
[256:08.73]Well, hold on a second.
[256:10.81]If I... People, like, have played this game before and played through to this part.
[256:16.25]You want me just to, like, cheat?
[256:18.89]You want me just to look over at chat and get all the answers to every question?
[256:23.84]That doesn't seem right.
[256:25.02]That's just me cheating.
[256:27.78]I don't want to cheat.
[256:28.54]I, like, love this game.
[256:29.60]I don't want to just be like, hey, give me the answers.
[256:31.06]Give me all the answers, quick.
[256:37.66]I don't need to play.
[256:38.18]You guys don't have to be my game genie.
[256:40.10]It's okay.
[256:47.93]Jeremy's cheating.
[256:51.71]Submode.
[256:52.43]No, that doesn't matter.
[256:58.47]Alright, so read the message.
[257:01.53]You trace out the message on the door, words of the most ancient tongue.
[257:04.57]I am protected by the worst fate, worst force in the world.
[257:08.69]Retreat, for I will take all your yesterdays and I will take all your tomorrows.
[257:18.26]I am protected by the worst force in the world.
[257:21.64]Retreat, for I will take all your yesterdays and I will take all of your tomorrows.
[257:31.35]This is the fourth spell.
[257:35.94]Hey, just open it.
[257:41.06]I can't read.
[257:45.11]Although I think, I'm pretty sure it did tell me what the last spell was.
[257:49.67]The fourth spell.
[257:50.39]It locks the throat and throws a spell of supreme power and force, but no one knows what it is.
[257:54.69]It's probably just Zed.
[257:57.16]Right?
[257:58.08]That would make the most sense, considering I can't die and I can't live.
[258:02.56]I'll take all your yesterdays, all your tomorrows.
[258:04.42]It's Zed.
[258:07.28]If Zed is an option, it's definitely Zed.
[258:09.10]It's not Zed, is it?
[258:18.20]Oh, do I have to open the door first?
[258:22.34]I don't know.
[258:26.68]Resurrect the dead?
[258:27.54]But what would that do?
[258:41.59]I have to, like, die here then.
[258:43.79]But... I don't know.
[258:50.19]Maybe I just have to die.
[258:53.27]Dopp.
[258:53.99]Use Dopp.
[258:56.79]I'm going to hopefully not ruin this.
[259:01.74]I'm going to open the door.
[259:05.08]And then I'm going to Zed.
[259:08.98]I'm going to have to use Zed.
[259:12.23]Here we go.
[259:12.51]I hope this is right.
[259:13.73]Push open the door.
[259:16.21]You reach for the door to push, only to feel a crackling of energy as your fingers near the wood.
[259:19.93]You snatch your hand back quickly.
[259:26.43]Yeah, so I need to die right here, and then Cass is dead right here.
[259:34.88]Push the door.
[259:37.57]There is no other way to know.
[259:38.95]You reach out for the wood and allow your fingers to connect with it.
[259:41.65]The effect is instant.
[259:42.55]A fire erupting from the wood and down your arms.
[259:45.48]You barely have a moment to gasp before you feel yourself thrown upwards into the stars and torn into a thousand pieces.
[259:51.40]But if this spell was intended to destroy, it does not.
[259:53.96]You are caught by the stars and held.
[259:56.62]This is it.
[260:01.46]What?
[260:04.42]What?
[260:05.91]Come on.
[260:11.33]What?
[260:13.73]No!
[260:17.99]No!
[260:19.31]What?
[260:19.99]It didn't work?
[260:23.61]Why did it not work?
[260:27.56]No, no, no, no!
[260:28.44]Oh, no.
[260:44.65]Son of a gun.
[260:51.26]I have to go all the way back up there.
[260:57.68]I can't rewind.
[260:58.38]Rewind, rewind.
[261:01.16]Rez is the only other spell that can counter death.
[261:04.64]Yeah, but there's nothing to rez.
[261:09.65]And the text made it seem like that was what I needed to do.
[261:13.11]I want to scroll up.
[261:15.48]Oh, no rewinds.
[261:16.38]Didn't it say, like, oh, you're held in the stars?
[261:18.26]It was correct.
[261:20.44]What were the new clues?
[261:27.55]Spellify.
[261:28.09]It's just telling me that.
[261:28.81]Okay, so it's dock, file, tell, zed.
[261:34.15]I figured it was just going to put me in front of her.
[261:42.18]Um...
[261:45.54]Let's just... I'm just going right back there and see what happens.
[261:52.23]Make a move.
[261:52.63]I just want to see if we can get in there.
[261:55.47]We're doing a speed run.
[261:58.75]Hello, yes, I'm a guard captain.
[262:00.13]How nice to meet you.
[262:02.31]Yeah, yeah, yeah, make a move.
[262:04.85]Approach the guards.
[262:05.56]Hi, guys.
[262:09.40]Yeah, alright, bye-bye-bye, return the salute, see you later, thank you for your encouraged... Encourager, yeah, beat that guy up, kick his ass.
[262:16.77]Nice work, good rock.
[262:17.87]Good rock!
[262:21.07]Look ahead, move on, move on, move on.
[262:22.99]Get me to the doors again.
[262:23.81]Do I have to, like, go resurrect my body?
[262:34.47]Rewind to the Snaticats.
[262:42.61]keep going this is a right pain in the ass need to use flanker yeah oh no does that mean these birds are back well I gotta do it I can do it the right way right uh it was bribe I gotta remember this god shit sigh move on I gotta remember what I did here I bribed him then I made them fight and then he was easy to kill

[263:13.87]Greet them.
[263:16.67]Uh, stand aside.
[263:17.59]I need to pass.
[263:18.37]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[263:19.35]I have a message.
[263:20.05]I'm the... Ah, fuck.
[263:22.49]I can make it worth your while.
[263:24.53]Uh, bribe the bird man.
[263:25.43]Uh, why don't you shut it up for him?
[263:29.18]Okay.
[263:30.80]There we go.
[263:31.50]Knock him down.
[263:33.06]Back to where we were.
[263:35.42]Cut him down.
[263:37.04]One more time.
[263:37.80]We'll do half blast.
[263:39.14]Half ma...
[263:41.31]Half my stamina.
[263:44.52]Half blast.
[263:45.38]Half my stamina.
[263:48.26]One more full blast.
[263:49.66]Okay.
[263:50.34]Get out of the way.
[263:52.00]Half blast.
[263:54.78]Half my stamina.
[263:59.64]Half.
[264:01.86]I have half stamina too.
[264:03.08]Shit.
[264:04.68]I can't sleep here, can I?
[264:08.67]I've played Sorcery before.
[264:09.79]Yes, that is correct.
[264:11.33]But at this stage, I did not get here.
[264:15.27]I did not do this.
[264:17.15]Everything I'm seeing at this point forward is stuff I've never seen before.
[264:23.22]So, yeah.
[264:24.42]I have played Sorcery.
[264:27.12]Because remember, Sorcery 4 came out like maybe four days before I started streaming.
[264:33.08]Like a month and a half ago.
[264:34.60]And we started at one.
[264:35.76]So I wasn't able to play the fourth one at all.
[264:40.10]Go get another fr- Oh, that's a good idea.
[264:43.28]Go get another- No, I'm not gonna do the jig thing again.
[264:45.68]I gotta go through all that again.
[264:52.66]No, we're just going up.
[264:53.48]I don't even care.
[264:54.02]I'm probably gonna die again anyways up here.
[265:03.69]Just keep going.
[265:04.37]I need to know if that did anything.
[265:07.61]There's still a bunch of shit I have not done.
[265:11.43]Keep climbing.
[265:12.69]Okay.
[265:14.37]By the doors, it was... Look at the doors.
[265:20.58]Okay.
[265:22.62]Oh, the pack is still there.
[265:23.58]Thank God.
[265:24.08]I can just pull this shit out.
[265:25.28]Look at the bottles.
[265:27.52]Take them all.
[265:29.92]Okay.
[265:30.94]Cast a spell.
[265:31.56]It was dock.
[265:33.20]Was the first one.
[265:39.79]D-O-C.
[265:42.52]Heal the Z's.
[265:43.06]Counter's hot.
[265:43.94]Pour it on the door.
[265:44.90]Okay.
[265:50.36]Okay, now I can do foul.
[265:58.49]I don't need to test the handle, do I?
[266:00.47]Can I do it back-to-back?
[266:01.69]Yeah, I think I can just do it back-to-back.
[266:04.59]At least I hope I can.
[266:10.13]Open the door.
[266:12.24]Manage for some sight.
[266:13.16]Okay.
[266:13.68]Cast tell.
[266:16.22]Don't forget to do gob.
[266:20.64]Tell.
[266:22.08]Alright.
[266:23.42]What the fuck is gonna happen here?
[266:25.03]Come on.
[266:27.11]Once more, a message has appeared on the door.
[266:29.69]Read the message.
[266:31.19]Yeah?
[266:31.71]Okay.
[266:32.53]So what the hell?
[266:34.55]Can I open the door?
[266:40.36]What happens if I open the door?
[266:42.32]I'm terrified right now.
[266:43.34]Do I have to do it again?
[266:45.00]Push the door.
[266:47.52]What?
[266:52.05]What?
[266:58.57]No, what the fuck?
[267:00.84]I thought it was gonna be... I thought it was, like, gonna be open.
[267:09.97]Oh, my fucking god.
[267:12.93]I thought that, like, I had already opened it, and, like, was I supposed to do it again?
[267:16.63]I thought that, like, Zed was, like, I already canceled out that spell, because it was life and death.
[267:34.97]So, what, I have to resurrect now?
[267:40.54]Why would I need to cast Zed there in the first place?
[267:46.63]Holy shit, this is such a pain in the ass.
[267:54.63]So I was assuming that when I did Zed the first time, it opened the door.
[268:00.70]Like, that spell was canceled because it's like a time-traveling spell.
[268:04.80]But now I have to resurrect the door.
[268:06.20]What?
[268:08.44]What?
[268:17.89]I can tell you something right now.
[268:20.61]This is dumb.
[268:26.67]Having to do, like, having to do all this shit again?
[268:28.93]This, like, sucks.
[268:35.55]Like, I essentially have to play through half of the game again to, like, get back to where I was.
[268:39.60]What the fuck is this?
[268:48.97]How come I don't get, like, two time machine checkpoints?
[268:51.04]I have to play through, like, the whole game again.
[268:53.74]What the fuck, sorcery?
[268:55.00]What's going on here?
[268:59.74]Sorry, I'm gonna cast Res on the door.
[269:09.79]What a complicated mess of an ending.
[269:13.23]And we're not even there.
[269:14.19]We're not even done.
[269:24.96]I just wish I didn't have to do this again.
[269:26.34]I'm gonna have to do this like three more times.
[269:36.97]Just pretend I'm farming holy waters.
[269:43.00]I have to like do everything exactly like I did it before.
[269:52.71]Just watch.
[269:53.01]One of these times I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna fuck something up.
[269:59.90]I'm gonna cast, like, Dock the second time.
[270:09.42]Farming for EXP.
[270:15.38]Jesus, I'm almost, like, dead.
[270:16.84]Full stamina.
[270:19.44]I'm about to go in, like, the main fortress.
[270:26.71]Let's do this again.
[270:31.73]There.
[270:32.03]I'm sorry.
[270:32.39]It was my understanding that, like, I was at least going to be able to push that door open and then, like, I could do... There was, like, res right after that Zed door.
[270:45.87]That's my mistake.
[270:50.97]Look at the bottles.
[270:51.83]Take them all.
[270:52.61]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[270:56.18]Okay, let's cast a freaking spell Board on the door Don't act you see what just happened there.
[271:13.94]I almost just clicked it cuz it like for a second It wasn't on there that would've been so bad.
[271:18.70]I would have been so screaming I Would have been so screaming
[271:28.10]Push the door again?
[271:28.90]No, I'm not going to fucking do that again.
[271:31.76]Not a chance at all.
[271:36.51]Okay, open the door.
[271:37.33]Yep, let's do a tell.
[271:41.37]And then a res.
[271:52.96]Alright.
[271:54.44]Don't touch the door.
[271:57.39]Cast a spell.
[271:58.09]Res.
[271:58.69]R-E-S.
[271:58.89]Res.
[271:58.97]Oh no.
[272:04.43]Do I resurrect myself?
[272:11.60]Or do I just pour it on the door?
[272:25.54]Here's a hint, but much more obscure.
[272:26.64]Sleepiness and idiocy help break the spell, but one more full undoes it.
[272:32.35]Love your great stream.
[272:33.13]Thanks, Killer Crocomire.
[272:38.03]Pour it on the door.
[272:46.55]People are telling me all kinds of shit that I- and I- did I do it right?
[272:49.84]I hope so.
[272:50.72]You pour the glittering water over the handle of the door.
[272:52.44]It seems to soak into the wood without any noticeable effect.
[272:55.76]Whether it has any effect on the door is impossible to say.
[273:02.13]Open the fucking door!
[273:03.79]NO!
[273:41.78]pants but a moment later the sensation fades indeed you feel refreshed as though your body had been destroyed and then built a new your maximum stamina has just increased you step without difficulty through the throw open door I did it right I did it right it was right I did it right I did it right I did it right it's okay right
[274:21.35]I was about to be real mad at everybody.
[274:26.80]And myself.
[274:30.74]It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the dark.
[274:33.74]You're inside the Tower of Mampang.
[274:35.96]The only way is forward now.
[274:37.24]There could be no turning back.
[274:40.89]Pray for aid.
[274:43.31]You close your eyes and try to pray, but you cannot do it.
[274:45.47]The walls seem to mock your every whisper.
[274:47.51]No voices hear you.
[274:52.57]Nice job, game.
[274:56.67]No voices hear you.
[274:57.69]By the way, here's five fucking stamina for free.
[275:00.97]Look around.
[275:05.06]This place has the appearance of a cave, half submerged by water.
[275:08.86]The black stone is slick with water and a spongy moss grows from every crack and crevice.
[275:14.20]Cobwebs blur the corners as though the ceiling was hidden by mist.
[275:19.39]It is as though no one has walked this way for a thousand years.
[275:26.59]You make your way further along the passageway, footsteps echoing on the cold stone.
[275:33.25]I didn't mean... I was going to mute that, but who gives a shit?
[275:37.17]You reach the base of a wide flight of stairs.
[275:39.38]They seem to fill the space of the tower, as though whatever lived here was impossibly wide.
[275:44.46]A few closed doors lead off to other rooms in the tower.
[275:50.42]Look at the doors.
[275:52.51]You look over the doors they seem ancient one appears chewed bread only knows who lives here, it would surely do you little go to find out.
[276:00.99]The climb is exhausting and you quickly lose count of the steps, there are no windows and no doors nothing to measure your progress by it is as though the tower is screwing downwards into the ground with every step you take.
[276:16.88]My god.
[276:17.48]This is going to be a nightmare further on.
[276:23.02]After some time, you spy a door up ahead, set in the inside wall of the tower.
[276:29.39]Look at the door.
[276:30.85]From here, you can barely see the outline, but it seems to be Darkwood with an iron grill.
[276:35.49]You pace forward every sense on high alert.
[276:40.30]Outside the cell.
[276:41.36]Yeah.
[276:44.98]The passageway stops by a heavy door that is clearly a cell set with a tiny iron grill.
[276:51.48]A hook is fixed directly opposite, no doubt to taunt prisoners with the sight of the key, but the hook is empty.
[276:58.43]The stairs continue upward from here.
[277:01.46]Look through the grill.
[277:04.33]You peer through the grill.
[277:05.97]The cell appears to be empty.
[277:07.35]Certainly, though, you can see a cot.
[277:10.07]There is no one on it, and the floor is empty, too.
[277:12.89]Then you notice something in a shadowy corner moving, but the shape, whatever it is, cannot be bigger than a rat.
[277:22.04]Can I open the door?
[277:24.06]The door is locked.
[277:24.66]Can I dop it?
[277:31.62]Let's give dop a try.
[277:33.75]D.O.P.
[277:34.73]Stop.
[277:38.81]You raise your arms to cast the enchantment, but nothing happens.
[277:41.32]The starlight seems to simply wave around you and disappear.
[277:45.90]I can't cast spells in here?
[277:50.08]Okay.
[277:51.64]Apparently I can't open the... I need like a key.
[277:53.38]I can't... Apparently I can't do any magic in here.
[277:56.59]I guess.
[277:59.89]Climb the stairs.
[278:04.52]The stairs reach a landing that curves around the tower.
[278:06.96]A colored glow spills across the stones from a large, stained window.
[278:13.21]Look at the window.
[278:15.87]You look over at the window.
[278:17.29]The colored panels form a mosaic of coiled lizard.
[278:20.85]Perhaps a serpent.
[278:23.53]But you do not have time to consider it long before you hear a voice at your back.
[278:28.00]Face me.
[278:34.14]Turn around.
[278:36.74]You turn around and meet a pair of quick, intelligent eyes that do not smile.
[278:40.68]You stare at a shadow before you moves, becoming a man.
[278:44.48]It is Flanker!
[278:47.12]Flanker!
[278:48.50]Flanker!
[278:49.52]It's good to see you!
[278:51.16]You rush forward, expecting an embrace, but your gesture is met by coldness.
[278:57.35]I feared we would meet here.
[278:59.45]I did not know for certain.
[279:01.35]There is something terrible in his tone.
[279:07.35]Help me!
[279:09.09]I am an assassin, he replies.
[279:11.63]Flanker stares at you with those dead eyes that have seen so much death.
[279:16.15]It is my air, my breath.
[279:18.29]I must do as I must do.
[279:20.81]As we all must do.
[279:27.53]Flanker, tell me, what is going on here?
[279:31.02]He nods, his rich eyes deep with sadness.
[279:34.66]When we met, I knew my destination, but not my target.
[279:38.86]Had I known, I would have killed you sooner, Adelander.
[279:45.81]I thought we meant something to each other.
[279:48.55]I recall I beat you.
[279:49.89]Grab his arm.
[279:54.19]Take his arm.
[279:56.84]You reach forward to take his arm.
[279:58.38]A split second seems to pass, and then suddenly there is a gasping pain in your right side.
[280:02.70]Flanker steps back, his blade running with blood.
[280:08.78]Motherfucker.
[280:10.80]I fear I now possess an irrevocable advantage.
[280:14.43]If you kneel, I will make your death quick.
[280:17.53]He has cut off your hand at the wrist.
[280:23.35]What is he doing?
[280:24.03]What the fuck?
[280:28.06]I thought we meant something to each other.
[280:29.90]Oh, no.
[280:36.02]Why is he doing this?
[280:38.82]I thought we meant something.
[280:39.84]You sob.
[280:40.88]Flanker is unmoved.
[280:41.90]Let us imagine we died on the point of the other's sword out there in the woods of Shumanadi.
[280:47.23]The rest is nothing more than a dream dreamt in a moment of fear.
[280:51.17]His blade leaves it scabbard in a curved movement.
[280:53.99]You close to them in the narrow space between the window and the door.
[280:56.49]This will be your final dance.
[281:00.12]He's gonna win.
[281:03.78]19?
[281:05.60]Oh my god.
[281:13.59]His stroke is a sweeping cut.
[281:15.33]A flutter of grace and hidden force.
[281:16.93]The ear seems to... You catch the blow on the very hilt of your sword.
[281:19.71]The bell-like flanker laughs.
[281:23.49]Oh god, we had sex with this guy?! !
[281:28.85]Well, he just did full blast, so that means, yeah, he's going to defend, obviously.
[281:35.08]You hold firm and keep your defense, and he hangs back and watches you without a motion.
[281:38.74]Closing his eyes, Flanker murmurs a quick prayer as he sets his stance.
[281:48.61]This is almost impossible for me to beat him, by the way, because of how much stamina he has.
[281:54.55]I just don't know what to do here.
[282:03.03]Because he just... He has, like, full stamina now.
[282:05.75]Great.
[282:06.85]Give me a fucking break.
[282:07.71]Even if I did full blast.
[282:10.07]Look at this.
[282:10.99]Well, no.
[282:11.31]If I did full blast, I just barely would have beat him.
[282:14.34]There's no way I could have known that was going to happen.
[282:15.80]So he just used that.
[282:33.52]3.8?
[282:33.64]Great.
[282:51.19]You drop yourself into a crouch and he circles away.
[282:53.19]You have traveled far.
[282:54.29]I will ensure your body is returned.
[282:56.19]Oh, yeah.
[282:56.75]Come at me again with, like, 13.
[282:57.63]Nope.
[282:58.13]I'm just gonna die.
[283:00.45]It's over.
[283:01.13]I'm dead.
[283:03.03]I'm dead.
[283:03.55]It was fun while it lasted, but my friend is going to kill me.
[283:07.25]You stay steady and keep your defense.
[283:08.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[283:09.17]You stumble backwards while toppling down the stairs.
[283:10.81]You're weakening.
[283:11.37]Flanker spins his sword about to shift the sword across his body.
[283:15.35]8.9, that means he has... Fucking dick.
[283:32.23]And now he's going to come at me full blast.
[283:35.59]Why didn't you fight?
[283:36.39]Because there's no opportunity for me to.
[283:38.57]Okay, I would have been able to do one hit on him so far.
[283:50.21]Finally.
[283:50.68]Jesus.
[283:51.26]Look at how lucky that was.
[283:54.04]13, 12.8.
[283:55.84]I... .2.
[283:57.98]And now I have to defend.
[283:58.84]I would have died.
[284:01.09]In fact, I still am going to die.
[284:08.69]Well... All I can do is full blast him.
[284:14.99]Oh boy, okay, this just got interesting.
[284:21.44]Wait a minute.
[284:39.42]Three firewaters?
[284:40.48]Polywaters?
[284:41.06]Wait, don't I have a... Where are my rations?
[284:48.07]Didn't I have a... Should I drink the holy water?
[284:49.81]I don't have any Blindleberry.
[284:54.99]But I can drink holy water.
[284:56.13]I did it.
[285:02.18]I'm gonna beat him.
[285:03.88]Okay, he's gonna come at me with like 16.
[285:11.14]No, he's not.
[285:12.12]Great.
[285:12.64]Fantastic.
[285:17.18]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[285:25.35]Wait a minute, I can try again.
[285:26.49]I can try again.
[285:31.09]No rewinds?
[285:32.17]No rewinds, huh?
[285:36.11]Well, isn't that just fun?
[285:39.36]I can rewind a thousand fucking times.
[285:45.22]I can rewind until I kill him.
[285:49.53]Isn't that just swell?
[286:00.26]I'm missing a hand still?
[286:01.48]Yeah, well, oh wait, can I... He's gonna come full hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[286:09.89]Talk him down?
[286:10.71]How am I supposed to talk him down?
[286:13.60]We're in the middle of a fight right now.
[286:15.82]You don't have a hand.
[286:17.04]You're gonna fight the final boss without a hand.
[286:22.55]Losing that hand is a pretty big deal.
[286:25.73]Go back to get your hand.
[286:36.94]I'm gonna kill him.
[286:37.70]Fuck this guy.
[286:42.01]Ooh, now he's in a bad spot.
[286:48.48]Okay, that was smart.
[286:54.60]Shit.
[286:59.66]Dammit! 4.5.
[287:11.60]asshole I get I don't have a hand anymore FailFish FailFish FailFish do it FailFish do it flanker risk was a short mantra over your body as you discipline from life yeah
[287:45.38]Nice rewind.
[287:46.26]This has no strategy.
[287:48.32]Well, look, dude, this guy's got fucking an extra eight stamina on me.
[287:55.59]I'm just dying.
[287:56.25]I don't give a shit.
[287:56.79]I'm dead.
[288:01.09]What's my fate?
[288:04.31]Oh, here you go.
[288:05.77]I didn't have a fucking hand.
[288:06.91]Everyone's saying I don't have a hand, so I can't even win anyways, apparently.
[288:13.85]Now this time, don't grab him.
[288:21.29]Otherwise, I can't beat the game.
[288:31.32]Flanker's got excellent stamina.
[288:41.28]Alright.
[288:43.01]Alright, I think.
[288:43.81]Wait a minute, you can respond to the steps.
[288:49.89]What are you talking about?
[288:50.47]What are you guys talking about?
[288:55.57]What are you talking about?
[288:56.19]What?
[288:56.55]I can respond to the steps?
[289:09.09]Yeah, but who cares?
[289:12.90]Look, I don't even know the rest of the secrets.
[289:28.13]What?
[289:28.57]I haven't even explored all the secrets yet, guys.
[289:35.31]Come on.
[289:41.75]Alright, let's go die.
[289:45.50]Make a move.
[289:45.82]What's the quickest way for me to die?
[289:50.42]Here we go.
[289:51.32]This person, right?
[289:53.06]Wasn't there a guard here?
[289:55.34]No, the guard's asleep.
[289:58.33]No, okay.
[289:58.89]The puke room.
[289:59.29]The poison room.
[290:05.05]Right here.
[290:05.87]I can die instantly in here.
[290:06.79]Don't worry.
[290:10.21]Uh, let's open the chest.
[290:11.95]Oh, where to open it?
[290:13.37]You flip open the lid.
[290:14.21]Oh, what's inside?
[290:15.93]Oh, shit, cool, there's a loose gold coin.
[290:18.08]Tip the box over.
[290:20.24]Oh, a click.
[290:21.60]Oh, no.
[290:27.42]Alright, here's the only thing I can tell you guys.
[290:30.44]Here's my only excuse for that, and I'll give it to you.
[290:33.73]So right when I died, I immediately looked over to my other monitor.
[290:39.48]staring over here and just dragged with my hand I just figured it was gonna by the time I looked over it was just like I was gone from that part search the room throw over the bed what how come I'm not dying lift the rug plug the ceiling vent take a breath
[291:09.70]I died!
[291:10.14]I've been poisoned!
[291:17.69]Just pretend you didn't see it.
[291:32.42]I fucking hate myself.
[291:43.31]You can go back from here.
[293:37.13]Okay.
[293:38.97]Well.
[293:42.11]This is 2008 YouTube.
[293:49.78]That person just made me so happy again.
[294:07.12]Sap on myself.
[294:08.02]Alright.
[294:08.32]Well, I think I'm going to call it a night.
[294:11.42]I'm a little too tired.
[294:13.22]Brain hurts.
[294:18.19]Yeah.
[294:29.77]End stream at 6 a.m.
[294:35.75]Jerma casted ug8 I Wish I saw it.
[294:39.87]I was just too busy not paying attention I Wanted to say hello to my friends in chat and caused me a massive problem Because every other time I died I just went right back to that spot It was like muscle memory, and I just want to say say hi to the guy that called me a shithead Somebody called me a shithead in chat, and I just wanted to say hey.
[295:00.78]What's up, man.
[295:01.18]I
[295:14.76]It's okay.
[295:15.34]You tried your best.
[295:19.92]Yeah, I'm gonna call it there.
[295:22.52]We will finish sorcery.
[295:24.18]I'm very fucking close to the end of this game.
[295:26.82]Extremely close.
[295:28.64]So here's what's gonna happen.
[295:30.82]Because it's getting a little too late.
[295:35.41]Probably on Sunday or Monday.
[295:39.54]I'm going to finish the Hitman campaign and Sorcery.
[295:46.56]So, we'll do it back to back because I can't assume there's very much more.
[295:50.89]I'm just sapped right now.
[295:56.65]So, yeah.
[295:57.77]On either Saturday, probably Saturday, one of these off days here.
[296:03.88]I'm going to finish this, then I'll finish Hitman back to back.
[296:10.09]What's my plan?
[296:10.61]You're not close.
[296:11.07]What's my plan for killing the Archmage?
[296:13.15]Drive a sword directly into his brain.
[296:17.79]Yeah, you'll get like a double feature dog shit stream.
[296:20.36]Something like that.
[296:26.02]Saturday.
[296:26.50]I can't do it tomorrow.
[296:28.54]It would either be on Sunday or Monday.
[296:34.67]What about Mafia?
[296:35.79]I am done with Mafia.
[296:38.41]But thanks everybody for sticking around.
[296:41.31]Hope you enjoyed it.
[296:42.73]I had fun.
[296:43.91]Up until about three seconds ago.
[296:46.01]Like three minutes ago.
[296:48.09]When I apparently missed the teleportation.
[296:54.41]It's going to be at least five more hours?
[296:59.95]Really?
[297:00.48]So wait.
[297:00.86]You're telling me I wasn't even close.
[297:04.74]So me coming back here is not even a big deal.
[297:07.14]Is that what you're saying?
[297:16.30]Convince Flanker to help you kill him next time.
[297:20.36]Well, there's a bunch of stuff I still haven't seen.
[297:22.35]I kind of rushed right to the tower, which is probably a mistake anyways.
[297:26.11]The hell here is cats.
[297:35.86]Good night, guys.
[297:36.86]Much love.
[297:37.30]Oh, shit, I missed a lot of people.
[297:38.76]Before we go, let me just start yelling people's names up.
[297:43.87]I will see you guys on either Sunday or Monday.
[297:46.31]It can't just end there, right?
[297:50.89]I'm sure that I was probably... I still haven't explored all this shit.
[297:57.78]There's still a bunch of places in here.
[297:59.28]I didn't even do this yet.
[298:02.44]I didn't do this.
[298:03.64]There's a lot of things I still haven't done.
[298:06.60]So, considering...
[298:09.45]There's a very high possibility that even if I got up there, it probably wouldn't have been over anyways.
[298:14.11]Because people are telling me that I wasn't even close.
[298:17.19]So, we'll see.
[298:19.17]But, much love.
