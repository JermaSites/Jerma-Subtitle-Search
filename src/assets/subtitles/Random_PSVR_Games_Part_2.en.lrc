[00:01.23]So I missed a stream last week.
[00:03.77]So we're going to do it.
[00:05.23]We're going to play some more VR for a couple hours.
[00:09.96]As long as I can take it, right?
[00:11.08]I hope you guys are having a good night.
[00:14.54]We're starting later than usual.
[00:17.06]But this is a Monday makeup stream.
[00:19.29]It ain't on time.
[00:19.97]You know what I mean?
[00:22.97]But I'll be back in a second.
[00:24.35]I'm just going to set it all up.
[00:25.33]Get the headset on.
[00:27.09]And we'll switch over.
[00:27.97]See you in a minute.
[00:45.39]Did anybody just hear a word I fucking said?
[00:49.22]Or am I actually not live right now?
[00:53.54]I've just been talking for like three minutes.
[00:55.84]Did you guys hear anything?
[01:00.67]I hope you could hear that.
[01:02.55]Everybody heard what I was saying, right?
[01:06.03]Nobody heard anything.
[01:08.24]What the fuck is going on?
[01:10.16]Seriously, I don't know what's going on with Twitch lately, but the last two streams, I've started the stream, and it says I'm live, and I was just fucking talking for like a good two minutes.
[01:23.37]Well, okay.
[01:26.23]I don't know what's going on with that.
[01:27.57]That shouldn't be happening.
[01:28.67]Someone just gave money.
[01:30.67]Someone just gave like $200 million.
[01:31.65]Hold on a second.
[01:40.30]Uh-huh.
[01:43.46]It's easy to blame others.
[01:44.54]Well, I don't know.
[01:45.26]That's new.
[01:45.84]That shouldn't be happening.
[01:46.60]I have not noticed that until very recently.
[01:51.94]Yeah, I saw you were live for 45 seconds.
[01:53.90]Yeah, I was... What's going on, Spencer?

[10:58.32]Alright.
[10:58.62]So what was I supposed to do?
[11:00.52]I didn't get the tutorial for this one.
[11:09.02]I have no idea how to use these because I have like a triangle.
[11:11.78]Where is triangle on this thing?
[11:14.34]Okay, there we go.
[11:15.04]Alright.
[11:18.18]I have to fucking relearn.
[11:19.38]I don't even know where the buttons are.
[11:20.72]On the move controller.
[11:21.32]I have no idea.
[11:22.40]Alright, what is in here?
[11:24.28]Yeah.
[11:29.04]I really wish I played the whole game with these.
[11:31.84]Instead of just like dusting my pants a little bit.
[11:34.64]Yep, there we go.
[11:41.30]Okay, that's kinda cool.
[11:43.04]I'm glad I can do that, but how do I fucking open this?
[11:50.38]Okay, so not that.
[11:52.91]I can't, like, grab shit?
[11:57.67]Okay, that tool is right there.
[12:03.59]Okay, I'm supposed to be examining a body, but how do I bring up... How do I bring up the tools?
[12:11.46]You know what I'm saying?
[12:12.68]Didn't I have tools?
[12:15.82]Oh my god.
[12:16.91]Alright, well let's go look at this dickhead.
[12:28.33]No.
[12:30.47]Okay, this is getting to the point of being fucking unbearable.
[12:36.46]I want to go right there.
[12:37.32]Triangle.
[12:38.46]Triangle.
[12:44.22]I want to go over there.
[12:45.04]Wait, what?
[12:46.92]Why the fuck can't go there?
[12:52.82]What the fuck is going on right now?
[12:54.76]I want to like go there.
[12:59.39]Okay, somebody's got to fucking help me out with this one.
[13:01.89]What the fuck is going on?
[13:05.47]There's nothing more here.
[13:07.01]I should examine the third body.
[13:13.96]Honestly, like, here's triangle right here, right?
[13:16.64]That's triangle.
[13:17.40]You see it?
[13:18.96]Triangle's right there.
[13:20.44]Right here.
[13:22.75]Why is triangle not moving?
[13:24.29]Why am I, like, just turning around when I hit triangle?
[13:28.53]Every single one of these buttons is turn around.
[13:33.57]Like, legitimately, there's triangle.
[13:37.11]I'm gonna show it again.
[13:39.15]Let's press it right now.
[13:41.23]I just turned around.
[13:48.87]Okay, that wasn't triangle that did that.
[13:50.67]That was not triangle.
[13:52.33]Cool.
[13:53.49]I'm glad that that worked.
[13:58.65]Let me, like, break Robin's neck again.
[14:02.84]Okay.
[14:08.22]Okay, this is the first body.
[14:10.82]We already looked at this guy.
[14:14.31]There's the second body.
[14:18.22]Where's this third body?
[14:21.32]Does anybody know?
[14:26.63]I don't have a key card.
[14:34.49]Can I open this?
[14:40.64]I can do this, though.
[14:42.86]I can't open that.
[14:52.09]This is the second body.
[14:53.01]Alright, that just scared the shit out of me.
[14:59.00]This is the same problem I had last night.
[15:01.56]Oh, two nights ago.
[15:04.46]Where is this third body?
[15:05.90]It doesn't exist.
[15:12.72]Like, the whole game so far has not been this stupid where it's like a mysterious fucking hidden third person.
[15:21.86]Where's the third body?
[15:27.36]Need to find the key.
[15:31.16]Open the safe.
[15:34.47]The body is in the cupboard.
[15:35.97]It's in the cremator.
[15:36.85]Okay, well, I guess I can't... I have no fucking idea what's going on.
[15:45.15]All I know is I switched control schemes.
[15:49.50]All I can assume is I have to open this thing.
[15:52.92]like this right like I need like a key to open that so key is in like the safe what the what's like the oh god I'm so used to using I'm so used to using the actual controller this is causing me massive issues right now can I please pick it up

[18:08.32]I am sincerely having a little trouble understanding this one, guys.
[18:18.19]Wait, what?
[18:29.24]Let's just plug in the controller.
[18:31.02]This is fucking insane.
[18:37.60]No, not five.
[18:38.56]I don't even know if this is the right combination.
[18:41.35]I must just not be in the right spot.
[18:46.15]Oh, the PogChamps.
[18:50.27]This is... Wait.
[19:05.44]Come on, you can't do that shit.

[19:18.71]How do I recalibrate?
[19:21.23]Where's the recalibrate this fucking dumb thing button?
[19:24.81]That's not it.
[19:25.79]That's not it.
[19:26.49]This is just not made right.
[19:29.61]I gotta...

[19:47.31]No, I can't.
[19:48.13]Watch.
[19:48.43]Watch this.
[19:49.17]You're too close to the screen.
[19:50.51]That's why it's not working.
[19:52.71]I calibrated it already.
[19:54.95]You're too close.
[19:55.71]Alright, hold on.
[19:59.13]This is a fucking mess right now.
[20:01.63]Fucking Sony Online Entertainment.
[20:07.47]Hold on.
[20:07.65]I'm going to fix this.
[20:08.31]I'll be right back.
[20:09.31]I'm going to recalibrate this stupid shit.
[21:34.37]Yeah.
[22:01.85]I'm telling you, like, just watch.
[22:03.00]You'll see.
[22:03.70]But look.
[22:04.98]Just, okay, no, wait, wait.
[22:06.78]I'm going to look at the lock.
[22:09.30]I'm looking at the lock.
[22:10.86]Okay.
[22:11.16]Now you use your hands and you hit four.
[22:12.62]Wait, what?
[22:13.62]No, you got to press four.
[22:14.70]No, you just press six.
[22:15.86]You just press six.
[22:17.25]No, do it again.
[22:17.71]It was two.
[22:19.41]You got to use the other hand.
[22:20.79]Yeah, I have to use.
[22:21.89]So use your right hand and you have to hit two, five, four.
[22:27.31]Two, five, four.
[22:28.33]Where did my fucking hand go?
[22:29.51]I don't know.
[22:30.51]Wait, it just disappeared.
[22:32.13]Your hand is up there.
[22:32.87]Alright, two.
[22:35.55]Two.
[22:36.29]Wait.
[22:36.97]It just pressed three.
[22:38.61]Listen.
[22:39.01]You're getting me pressured.
[22:40.19]Stop.
[22:40.94]Look over there.
[22:42.98]I'm trying to get it solidified.
[22:47.32]Wait, so how do you press backspace since I fucked up?
[22:49.74]There's no backspace.
[22:50.72]Alright, hold on.
[22:52.82]Wait, wait, wait.
[22:53.60]I'll figure it out.
[22:54.32]Just give me a second.
[22:55.00]I'm doing this.
[24:21.75]Let's see if that fixed it.
[24:22.75]It didn't fix anything.
[24:25.13]It's still, like, crooked as hell.
[24:28.05]Okay, I'm going back in.
[24:29.51]Wish to be like... Oh, would you look at that?
[24:32.22]Oh, let's... Oh, look at this.
[24:33.60]Oh, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, five, four, three.
[24:36.42]Give me a fucking break.
[24:37.38]It was two... Two... Two, five, four.
[24:49.52]It's 2, 4, 5.
[24:51.76]5, 4, 2, 5.
[24:53.78]Wait, you told me the combination earlier.
[25:00.18]2, 4 something.
[25:04.82]What is the fucking code?
[25:06.48]Somebody just give me the code.
[25:08.06]Is it 4, 2, 5?
[25:09.30]Give me the fucking code.
[25:12.06]This is the worst game I've ever played because of this problem.
[25:14.78]4, 2...
[25:18.10]Oh my fucking god.
[25:19.08]Seriously, game.
[25:20.88]Four, two, five.

[25:24.90]Open it!
[25:26.24]How do I open it?
[25:30.58]Give me the fucking key.
[25:31.62]Okay.
[25:32.70]No, take the key.
[25:34.82]And close this.
[25:36.02]No, close this, please.
[25:37.92]Turn around.

[26:51.02]Okay.
[26:52.77]Ow!
[26:53.09]My ears.
[26:54.77]This is the key.
[26:56.19]Good.
[26:58.18]Alright, put this shit down.
[27:00.28]Put this down.
[27:02.00]Put it down.
[27:02.36]Get the key.
[27:32.22]Give me the key.
[27:34.48]I thought it was over.
[27:36.28]I thought this shit was over.
[27:38.62]I thought it was over.
[27:39.42]Get in there and get the key.
[27:50.13]Watch this.
[27:51.39]This is how we're going to do this.
[27:53.33]This is how we're going to do this.
[27:57.99]Put this down.
[28:06.88]Right?
[28:17.37]This is the fucking worst game ever.
[28:23.45]Get these out of here.
[28:25.11]Get these out of here.
[28:27.95]Turn off the fucking device.
[28:29.77]Turn them all off.
[28:30.75]Get them off.
[28:32.16]They ain't going on again.
[28:43.87]Get the motion control controllers, they said.
[28:46.65]Plug the motion controllers in.
[28:49.67]It'll be fun, they said.
[28:56.28]Give me a fucking break.
[28:58.82]And now this is all fucking messed up.
[29:02.54]What a monumental pain in the ass.
[29:13.23]Holy shit, those controllers.
[29:14.55]Seriously, they make me want to fucking swallow glass.
[29:20.48]Okay.
[29:23.78]Here we go.
[29:25.22]We have the key now.
[29:26.12]Good for us, right?
[29:28.40]Good for us.
[29:29.03]How do I turn around?
[29:45.28]I need the forensic scanner to search for evidence.
[29:47.38]Wait, what?
[29:51.08]How do I turn it on?
[29:54.86]How do I turn it on?
[29:55.92]Okay.
[30:03.03]Ugh!
[30:06.49]Beer.
[30:07.85]Open the fucking door.
[30:08.89]Get it in there!
[30:16.25]Pull the body out.
[30:17.32]Quickly, please.
[30:18.34]Can I fly down?
[30:19.80]No.
[30:28.70]Okay.
[30:29.39]Let's take a look.
[30:33.93]Was this this fucking shitty last time?
[30:41.78]Part of the bomb's detonator punctured the lower abdomen.
[30:48.29]I was just like, you guys understand, right?
[30:51.53]Like, what on God's fucking green Earth was all that?
[30:58.40]Well, I hope that was entertaining.
[31:00.78]Because holy shit, that was unbearable.
[31:02.52]Okay, how do I change this mode again?
[31:09.77]Can't I change the mode?
[31:12.07]Somehow...
[31:20.95]There it is.
[31:24.06]Okay.
[31:24.28]Alright.
[31:24.52]Come on, bat computer.
[31:25.04]Do I get to rewind this?
[31:25.90]Oh, great.
[31:49.54]I wasn't expecting to have to, like, play this.
[31:51.07]I didn't want to do, like, this game.
[31:55.77]Wait, what?
[32:06.61]Huh.
[32:16.54]Hopefully this is entertaining, guys.
[32:22.99]Like fixing a screw.
[32:32.76]Is that correct?
[32:35.20]No, that's not correct.
[32:38.32]Is it correct?
[32:40.45]Apparently it is.
[32:43.75]That's not correct.
[32:57.48]Alright, I'll jam it through that guy's sternum.
[33:02.21]The device was registered to City Vision Demolitions.
[33:05.75]They're demolishing an old sewer system beneath Founders Island.
[33:08.80]The sewer could be the killer's hideout.
[33:11.36]If I target our scanners on this area, maybe I can pick up Robin's transmitter.
[33:16.52]Scanning.
[33:17.20]Decrypting radio signal.
[33:17.97]All for him.
[33:23.68]God, I'm so glad we're out of that nonsense.
[33:26.46]That was fucking unbearable.
[33:28.76]Alright, so we get out, right?
[33:37.63]Oh, find Robin.
[33:39.07]Let's go.
[33:44.47]Sir, that sewer system has been ostensibly abandoned for some time.
[33:47.71]Whoever trapped Robin may well have made preparations for...
[33:53.64]Uh-oh.
[33:55.50]Uh-oh.
[33:59.04]I would love to see this right now.
[34:02.62]Would anybody else?
[34:03.60]Oh.
[34:13.49]I thought that was a giant spider.
[34:21.69]The Joker!
[34:22.79]Alright, we need some action real quick here, Bethesda.
[34:29.55]Who made this game?
[34:30.41]Naughty Dog?
[34:31.49]Uh...
[34:51.82]Should I take out the batarangs?
[34:55.40]You got it.
[34:55.80]Alright.
[35:00.66]Easy enough.
[35:01.16]Oh, this Robin.
[35:07.37]Wait.
[35:08.21]What?
[35:21.95]Oh, let me out of here.
[35:22.63]Batman, you're just in time for my daring escape.
[35:31.12]I followed the trail like you said.
[35:32.32]I'm led down here.
[35:35.48]They're knowing you?
[35:36.24]I didn't see them coming.
[35:39.63]This graffiti.
[35:41.79]Some kind of Joker copycat, maybe?
[35:45.71]Wrong.
[35:46.59]And who are you calling copycat, Robin number three?
[35:49.35]Why did he let me keep my items?
[35:50.55]Let's get out of here.
[35:54.60]Let's get out of here, he says.
[35:55.92]Okay.
[35:56.90]Kind of easier said than done, dude.
[36:00.00]Whatever it does, it's got no power.
[36:03.64]I need that one back.
[36:06.35]I don't think it's working.
[36:16.83]I need that one that fell on the ground.
[36:19.87]Looks like it's blown huge.
[36:23.53]Need help over there, Robin?
[36:31.00]We need to hurry.
[36:36.44]Okay, what?
[36:38.94]It's like Joker on a skateboard?
[36:41.08]Well, give me that.
[36:42.76]Yeah, let me see that.
[36:47.43]That's it, I win, right?
[36:50.97]Yeah.
[36:51.59]I win.
[36:53.08]Thanks for playing.
[36:53.68]That's it.
[36:55.68]First try.
[37:01.04]Wait, what?
[37:07.85]Oh, God.
[37:09.27]We can electrocute ourselves.
[37:10.81]Great.
[37:13.81]Okay.
[37:14.42]Come on, let's go.
[37:15.76]Do something, Robin.
[37:19.97]Is that the Incredible Hulk?
[37:23.46]Oh, wait.
[37:23.80]I got it.
[37:24.08]I got it.
[37:24.30]I got it.
[37:27.08]I got it.
[37:32.72]Oh, I like to get him.
[37:36.39]Got it.
[37:36.67]Hey, I spell gumbo.
[37:41.81]Who invited him?
[37:43.95]Oh, Robin, I tell you my advice, but sometimes you need a new name.
[37:49.24]I already knew it was coming.
[37:50.09]Here, Robin, take this and put it over there.
[37:51.49]Trust me.
[37:53.71]Take this.
[37:54.51]It looks like some kind of gear box, but I'm missing some cogs.
[37:58.93]It's right here.
[38:00.74]Let's find them.
[38:01.60]It's right in front of you.
[38:02.18]Grab it.
[38:04.20]Great.
[38:04.72]We're getting out of here.
[38:07.04]No!
[38:07.84]This isn't right!
[38:10.61]This thing's going to survive us!
[38:15.16]Oh, my God.
[38:15.74]Come on.
[38:18.34]Please.
[38:28.38]What?
[38:29.04]It's not working.
[38:30.89]Anything else you could try?
[38:31.71]Take it.
[38:35.95]Great.
[38:40.75]Perfect.
[38:41.65]One more.
[38:43.75]Nothing in that one.
[38:47.45]There's nothing in that one.
[38:53.18]What the fuck?
[39:02.38]One more.
[39:02.84]Found it.
[39:03.42]Christ.
[39:04.62]What do I do?
[39:07.92]Who's the real monster here?
[39:17.86]You okay?
[39:20.43]Can we get out?
[39:21.61]We just need that last cog.
[39:23.79]Take it.
[39:27.73]Thanks.
[39:28.79]No, I'll be ready.
[39:29.97]I'll be ready with the motorcycle rev.
[39:31.91]Okay, try the lever.
[39:36.11]Let us out of here.
[39:37.33]We're gonna have to fight that guy, right?
[39:42.09]Alright, your side's jammed.
[39:44.03]Hang on.
[39:51.55]What are you doing?
[40:00.93]Okay, that should do it.
[40:02.13]That should do what?
[40:02.87]This is gonna get grabbed by the spooky guy.
[40:11.13]I knew it.
[40:11.85]I told you.
[40:15.79]He's trying to lighten his space!
[40:24.98]What?
[40:32.21]Somebody calling me?
[40:36.97]Where's my bat phone?
[40:49.12]What?
[40:55.87]Alright, we just sit here.
[40:57.25]Or do we not?
[41:01.53]No, we do just sit here.
[41:03.63]I don't have to make an escape.
[41:04.90]Okay, that's fine.
[41:09.88]This is very long.
[41:22.83]Hello?
[41:28.44]Are we in Arkham Asylum?
[41:35.07]Alright, I... I really need some action here, man.
[41:38.15]I guess it's getting like... Novelty's wearing a little thin here.
[41:53.35]Novelty.
[41:54.89]Cash.
[41:55.61]Okay.
[41:59.42]What do we think?
[42:00.98]Next?
[42:04.86]Next?
[42:08.83]No actual walking instantly three out of ten hours.
[42:11.33]Wait, what?
[42:14.37]Batman the Repair.
[42:15.87]Next, next.
[42:17.21]Next.
[42:19.39]We got other things to see here.
[42:20.68]We got big rigs over the road racing.
[42:23.20]Let's go for it.
[42:28.08]Big rigs over the road racing.
[42:31.02]Wait, what?
[42:33.98]It's literally almost over?
[42:35.28]Is it really?
[42:35.72]Alright, we're going to go.
[42:41.12]We're going to try breaks.
[42:43.76]Close Batman.
[42:46.56]That was such a fucking shit show.
[42:49.25]I've got the move controllers all ready to go.
[42:51.59]And it turns out to be the worst fucking possible thing I could have done.
[42:59.69]Confirm your position.
[43:00.61]Alright, hold on.
[43:01.09]I got to get back in.
[43:03.25]Here we go again.
[43:03.75]Actually, I got to change the stream title.
[43:06.22]Stream title says, fumbling around with move controllers in Batman for like 38 minutes.
[43:10.62]What's this game called?
[43:14.00]Rigs?
[43:18.88]Rigs.
[43:20.53]PSVR.
[43:21.31]Rigs.
[43:23.41]Rigs.
[43:26.12]rigs mechanic mechanic mechanical combat okay alright let's get back to it I'll see you guys on the other side you just had to move further away from the camera that's not true because I was way back I was way back here at one point and the move camera is like all the way over there no this is just something with the calibration with the move controllers and where I'm sitting it just wasn't going to work ever
[43:54.76]OK, adjust the position and angle of the PlayStation camera so that your face fits in the frame.
[43:58.78]Oh, my god.
[44:10.46]This has got to go up a little.
[44:15.05]That's got to go up.
[44:29.05]Fucking freak.
[44:34.22]Like in this little square?
[44:37.22]They want me to be like here.
[44:38.34]I have no idea what the fuck they want me to do.
[44:46.34]Whatever.
[44:46.64]The face is in the frame.
[44:56.00]Is it gonna be that much fucking closer?
[45:03.29]I don't understand this one.
[45:09.77]Just like far away?
[45:15.91]Like here.
[45:19.91]And here's another thing.
[45:21.17]This cord for the PSVR is fucking like not even two feet long.
[45:26.19]How the fuck did you expect anybody to do this shit, Sony?
[45:30.93]Oh, ow.
[45:36.76]I'm gonna rip that thing up.
[45:49.64]Where was it?
[45:50.02]It needs to come up.
[45:53.50]What a fucking joke.
[45:58.97]Are we like fucking for real right now?
[46:09.47]What the fuck?
[46:10.59]Do you have to be in that tiny square for this to work?
[46:19.18]So for this game to work, I have to stay in a four fucking centimeter square.
[46:26.59]Why?
[46:28.91]Can you guys even see me on the face cam?
[46:30.67]No, I'm like at the bottom.
[46:36.65]Okay.
[46:40.43]I look like fucking one foot tall right now.
[46:50.32]Okay.
[46:50.66]I mean, that looks cool.
[46:58.19]Can you guys even fucking hear me?
[47:14.89]I don't even know if you guys can even hear me.
[47:17.25]Because I have to be like so far away from my fucking screen.
[47:21.70]Did they like want this to be an esport at some point probably?
[47:29.90]I can't skip this.
[47:38.76]Alright, I get it.
[47:41.34]I get it.
[47:41.66]You desperately wanted this to be a sport.
[47:43.62]I get it.
[47:44.06]Like, can I play now?
[47:58.05]Alright, cool.
[47:58.63]Good, good.
[47:59.29]Got it.
[47:59.55]Alright, can I be Bumblebee?
[48:06.03]Which one of the Transformers do I get to be?
[48:26.81]Alright?
[48:34.09]I have to do the gameplay tutorial.
[48:35.97]I have to.
[48:36.47]How the fuck am I ever going to know what to do?
[48:46.71]This game was expensive, too.
[48:47.89]This wasn't like a $10 game, by the way.
[48:53.70]I think this was like $40 or $50.
[48:54.72]Hopefully it was worth it.
[48:59.55]while we sit in dead air and I just try to talk to you about something while Riggs over-the-road mechanical racing decides to load.
[49:12.13]Alright.
[49:16.68]Hey, welcome to the team.
[49:18.86]One second and I'll be right with you.
[49:21.98]You're gonna make me keep waiting?
[49:23.22]Thanks for waiting.
[49:25.96]This guy is one of our biometric scanners.
[49:29.16]I already regret doing this.
[49:29.98]Okay.
[49:44.56]I'm your chief engineer.
[49:46.90]Chief, for short.
[49:48.76]The team and I will maintain your rigs at optimal performance, run training exercises, provide tactical information during a match, everything you need to be a winner.
[50:01.57]First, there are some formalities we need to go through to bring you up to speed.
[50:06.77]We've prepped a test track so we can set it up just how you like it.
[50:10.85]Sound good?
[50:12.46]Let's get started, then.
[50:15.23]The pinnacle of EXO engineering.
[50:18.11]It's tougher, faster, and a whole lot meaner than the hardware you're used to.
[50:22.19]This is a Hunter-class chassis.
[50:27.21]She might seem small compared with other Rick types you'll encounter, but she's got it where it counts in terms of speed and maneuverability.
[50:35.56]She's equipped with twin auto-reloading assault cannons.
[50:41.34]These are the most advanced sticks on the market, giving you hair-trigger control over movement and firing.
[50:46.47]Don't even tell me I need the move controllers.
[50:47.77]She has state-of-the-art servo-ded actuators throughout her chassis, allowing her to cope with any terrain.
[50:56.11]Pretty cool, right?
[50:58.03]Okay, time to get you on board, I think.
[51:00.38]Thank you.
[51:00.90]Let's get her in position.
[51:02.96]I'm just going to call in a drone to lift you into the rig.
[51:07.20]Ah, here it comes now.
[51:08.54]You could have just put me inside this in the very beginning.
[51:13.25]You could've just started with me in here.
[51:14.67]I think I might need the move controllers.
[51:16.93]Okay.
[51:17.65]More calibrating.
[51:18.15]Can you guys even see that?
[51:45.66]Oh, boy.
[51:57.13]This is gonna be fun, but I'm gonna be here for a little while.
[52:01.47]Okay, I think it's time to skip.
[52:04.73]Time to get me out of this.
[52:07.06]How do I shoot the guns?
[52:07.88]That's all I care about at the moment.
[52:08.98]Mm-hmm.
[52:13.33]We don't have to do this again.
[52:14.27]We don't have to do this five times.
[52:19.55]Okay, everything's looking good on my end.
[52:21.74]Now it's time to have some fun.
[52:23.74]Let's move on to some target practice.
[52:26.30]I'm loading the target range.
[52:32.61]This is unnecessary.
[52:33.99]This is unnecessary!
[52:35.11]You don't need to load it!
[52:44.47]Each rig has two weapons.
[52:46.16]You can fire just one at a time or both together.
[52:49.22]Fire your right weapon now and destroy these targets.
[52:53.80]You got it.
[52:54.50]You got it, my friend.
[52:55.94]Great.
[52:56.90]No, try again.
[52:58.04]Fire your right weapon now and destroy these targets.
[53:01.60]Play.
[53:02.36]Play the game.
[53:02.98]This is fucking ridiculous.
[53:04.63]That just took like ten fucking minutes for them to tell me to hit R2.
[53:12.34]They spent like 10 minutes like world building.
[53:15.44]Like, dude, that shit, I don't, I just want to teach me how to fucking move my head around and shoot.
[53:18.88]I don't want to, I don't care about all this fucking team-based combat shit.
[53:23.58]Tell me how to play.
[53:26.94]Welcome to RIG's headquarters.
[53:29.48]You'll manage every aspect of your MCL career from right here.
[53:33.66]So let's take a brief tour of the facilities.
[53:35.63]No, no tours.
[53:36.59]In front of you is the RIG showroom.
[53:39.23]This is where you choose the rig you're going to use.
[53:42.23]Now, look down at the tablet in your hands.
[53:45.34]This is your interface for everything.
[53:47.74]You'll be using it a lot to further your career.
[53:50.78]The rigs you can see on the tablet are the basic rigs, including the Hunter you've just taken out for a spin.
[53:57.26]There are four classes of rigs, and you can select each one from this screen.
[54:01.70]Why don't you try... Each rig class has a unique profile, which changes how it handles and performs.
[54:08.96]If you'd like, you can take your currently active rig into the test arena
[54:12.95]This is cool.
[54:13.75]This is cool.
[54:14.57]Just give this to me.
[54:15.99]No test arena.
[54:18.97]Wait, what?
[54:19.71]Right.
[54:36.19]All of these rigs are more powerful than the basic rigs, but you'll have to earn credits to purchase them.
[54:42.21]To get you started, we've deposited some in your account.
[54:44.87]Okay.
[54:45.51]When you're ready, pick your first rig.
[54:47.41]Yeah.
[54:47.67]Who cares?
[54:48.49]Diablo.
[54:48.99]You can always try out each of the classes using the basic rigs.
[54:52.07]I don't need to see anything else besides El Diablo.
[54:54.19]That's what I want.
[54:54.69]I want El Diablo.
[54:59.52]I want El Diablo because it looks like a fucking pretzel.
[55:05.33]I think I have to take it into the test room.
[55:06.53]Shh.
[55:06.63]Shh.
[55:06.71]Hey, let me tell you all about it now.
[55:32.29]I don't mind games where they, like, tell you things and they show you things, but if it takes 20 minutes to play your game... Come on.
[55:42.42]I don't know why I picked tutorial.
[55:43.76]That was a mistake.
[55:45.10]The Sentinel.
[55:45.94]Wait, what?
[55:47.54]This monster packs a mean melee attack and can soak up a lot of damage.
[55:52.98]Despite its size, the Sentinel is capable of an extremely powerful vertical jump.
[55:59.64]To use it, press and hold your jump button to charge, then release.
[56:05.18]The longer you charge the jump, the higher you'll go.
[56:09.18]If you charge your jump to its max, the sentinel will cause a shockwave when it impacts with the ground.
[56:16.44]Now imagine if it just said hold X to do a jump on the screen.
[56:26.09]I wish I could have done this before.
[56:32.51]Alright, whatever.
[56:34.35]I have no idea what that looks like, but this is like... Fully charged.
[56:46.41]Okay.
[56:48.17]I guess I have to collect all this shit.
[56:49.52]Alright, can I like... Good target practice at least, right?
[57:08.21]I guess he just wants me to do this.
[57:11.07]Alright, cool.
[57:14.32]Just let me play the game.
[57:15.24]Why did I pick tutorial?
[57:22.05]You gotta play VR games with a spectacle?
[57:25.29]Yeah, but... I mean... It's a puke?
[57:30.49]It's a puke stream?
[57:34.96]This does look really cool.
[57:36.86]I want to, like, play around.
[57:38.03]I hope he's really not going to come and be like, oh, great, let me tell you about the snack bar.
[57:45.95]Of course he is.
[57:52.21]When you've seen enough, tap R1 to turn to the online lobby area.
[58:01.98]Okay, this is the online lobby area.
[58:04.70]From here, you'll arrange online fixtures and invite friends to join your team.
[58:10.05]If you look up from the screen, you'll see a holographic representation of yourself.
[58:15.05]Say hi.
[58:16.73]The empty spaces next to you will be filled by teammates and opposition pilots when arranging matches.
[58:22.73]We can go into more detail later.
[58:25.03]When you're ready, tap R1 again to turn round to the HQ area.
[58:32.39]So, you'll come here to customize your appearance and sign sponsorship deals.
[58:37.95]You can also test your skills in the solo trials or admire your collection of silverware.
[58:43.95]Take a look at the tablet.
[58:45.79]I've only made the customize option available for now.
[58:49.09]Press the cross button to activate it and we'll set you up.
[58:59.43]What was that you wanted me to do there, soldier?
[59:01.35]Hold on, I'm just gonna crack my back real quick.
[59:06.49]Wait, what?
[59:14.12]I don't wanna customize my guy.
[59:16.12]Fuck.
[59:16.24]Gonna tap R1?
[59:16.52]Yeah.
[59:27.03]Oh my god, what have I done?
[59:28.11]What have I done?
[59:28.71]I just wanna go and play.
[59:29.69]I just wanna play.
[59:30.41]Okay, uh, they got- they got frogs?
[59:32.85]This- I will forgive everything if there's frogs.
[59:56.56]I don't know.
[60:01.35]The dragons, the commas, the cobras, the bananas.
[60:04.34]The bananas.
[60:06.40]Sign me up to the bananas.
[60:08.20]Alright.
[60:09.34]Just don't get going in the next, like, five minutes.
[60:38.70]Tap the triangle button to activate one while it's highlighted.
[60:44.02]Available pilots are now displayed on the tablet.
[60:47.47]Right now, it's only the test pilots.
[60:49.67]Is this because I did tutorial?
[60:51.21]I think... Paying attention to their stats and the rig they will be piloting.
[60:55.57]When you've found one you'd like on your team, highlight them and hold the cross button to sign them up.
[61:01.48]Cross?
[61:01.88]I don't get D'Angelo.
[61:04.48]I don't give a shit.
[61:05.73]Nice.
[61:06.67]The team's starting to take shape.
[61:09.14]Let's fill the other empty position to complete the team.
[61:12.32]Choose a second test pilot, same as before.
[61:21.75]This guy.
[61:22.57]This lady.
[61:25.33]Now you have your team selected, I think it's time to test your skills in an offline match.
[61:31.21]Press the cross button to see who you're up against.
[61:34.51]Time for your first taste of the major leagues.
[61:37.05]Every win or draw earns points to move you up the table.
[61:40.27]Finish the season at the top and you win promotion to a higher league.
[61:44.06]You'll also see what type of match you're about to play.
[61:46.78]You don't have to explain to me how a tournament works.
[61:51.54]This one should be a lot of fun.
[61:53.47]When you're ready, hold the cross button to start the match.
[61:58.77]This is Team Takedown.
[62:01.45]In this sport, two teams of three take each other on in destructive combat.
[62:05.74]The rules are simple.
[62:08.00]Take down an opposition rig to earn a point for your team.
[62:11.60]At full time, the team with the highest score wins.
[62:15.70]When a rig is taken down, it releases power spheres.
[62:18.54]These can be collected by anyone to charge their overdrive gauge.
[62:22.61]Ejected pilots can choose to launch their rig at any of the arena's relaunch points.
[62:27.71]If the match is a tie at full time, extra time is played.
[62:30.88]This was fun before.
[62:31.82]In extra time, the match is won when an entire team has been eliminated.
[62:35.92]I'm just going to turtle in here.
[62:36.80]Extra time is played out with sudden death rules, so there are no reruns.
[62:41.78]If there is still a tie at the end of extra time, then the first takedown of the match determines the winner.
[62:47.68]You can earn additional personal points by assisting a teammate in taking down an opponent.
[62:55.90]Ow.
[62:57.15]Ow.
[62:58.19]I think, I think I hurt myself, chief.
[63:13.36]I really did just like pull a muscle.
[63:21.50]I really did just like hurt my shoulder.
[63:24.62]Rigs just hurt me.
[63:27.42]In physical physicality it hurt my neck Are we ready to go like I feel like I've lost a thousand people on stream I mean I have no idea Have we lost like two thousand people yet?
[63:57.71]Alright, let's play.
[64:04.06]Alright, let's go.
[64:05.72]Even this is dragged out.
[64:07.30]Going right at the middle.
[64:09.56]Straight at the middle.
[64:10.66]Gonna get right at the middle.
[64:16.32]Two kills.
[64:16.78]Here we go.
[64:18.70]Go.
[64:18.98]Straight at the middle.
[64:21.08]Go.
[64:27.52]Here we are in Dubai for this Team Takedown contest.
[64:30.94]Both teams have history here, and we'll be looking to stamp their authority on the match right from the start.
[64:37.22]Takedown.
[64:38.08]Dynamo score.
[64:40.56]Redeploying.
[64:41.44]Get ready.
[64:43.80]Systems online.
[64:44.62]Get out there and play.
[64:54.53]Solid takedown.
[65:00.07]I'm gonna throw up.
[65:05.50]I'm gonna fuck you.
[65:09.76]Like, where the fuck is the prime reason for this?
[65:14.71]Does this guy do anything?
[66:14.63]Wait, what?
[66:21.02]I would have given that game more of a chance.
[66:23.10]That's just... The tutorial was the tutorial, and then they wanted to tell me all these fucking lore-building world, but just tell me how to play the game.
[66:33.56]Just show me fucking on-screen prompts how to play.
[66:37.38]I don't care about the fucking, like, Banshee's lore versus the fucking frog people.
[66:41.70]Just show me how to play it.
[66:44.50]And, like, let me play.
[66:46.82]I shouldn't have pressed tutorial.
[66:48.00]That was fucking dumb.
[66:51.36]Uh, move controller.
[66:58.95]Okay.
[66:59.43]Let me get this set up.
[67:01.25]Do I only need one?
[67:07.58]Do I need both move controllers for this?
[67:19.51]This game is designed to be a seated experience.
[67:22.95]Why is it fucked up right now?
[67:26.41]Okay.
[67:27.92]Uh... Motion controller.
[67:33.58]Okay.
[67:43.71]So this is supposed to be fun.
[67:45.44]Hopefully it is.
[67:46.18]Do I need both?
[67:51.38]Is this fucking... Okay, I just crashed.
[67:54.86]I take from you.
[68:08.47]but every game ends and when this one is through I expect you to die
[68:21.22]The best of the best I expect you to die I expect you to die When you finally see The worst side of me Will finally be Eye to eye I expect you to die Alright.
[68:44.47]That voice in your ear No chance to save
[68:49.98]See, I like don't mind this beginning because this is like, this is, whatever, this is cool.
[68:56.63]But we are gonna, but we are gonna skip it.
[69:00.83]We are gonna skip it.
[69:03.33]Hey, would you look at that?
[69:04.53]A game that lets you skip fucking dumb shit that you don't want.
[69:07.89]That wasn't dumb.
[69:08.81]This is not dumb shit.
[69:10.08]That was not dumb.
[69:12.98]But you know what I mean.
[69:14.36]Welcome.
[69:20.21]Handler and support agent.
[69:21.91]We're going to be fast friends.
[69:23.75]I have no doubt Your new implants allow you to use telekinetic abilities to manipulate the world around you Back when I was a field agent, where's my hand go pick things up the old-fashioned way.
[69:36.52]It's kind of this I Find testing your spine to be an absolute joy.
[69:43.84]Don't you try leaning left?
[69:45.82]I
[69:47.98]Oh, that's cool.
[69:49.70]I want the gun.
[70:13.08]Your ability to push buttons is beyond reproach, Agent.
[70:16.44]But what about your ability to pick things up?
[70:20.34]Fortunately, as the current slide shows, that talented trigger figure of yours is also helpful in grabbing things.
[70:27.39]I've left you a very cryptic note by the projector.
[70:30.61]Try picking it up.
[70:38.64]Well, the major things are not always as they seem.
[70:41.90]But what the hell?
[70:43.20]Pick up the lighter on your left, then press the move button to light it.
[70:47.16]The move button is the flat smooth button under your thumb.
[70:51.05]Use the lighter to burn the note.
[70:54.37]Use the lighter to burn the note.
[71:02.25]How do I burn the note?
[71:03.90]Like this?
[71:05.80]Excellent.
[71:06.64]Let's practice aiming with your new telekinetic powers.
[71:09.86]Pressing the move button will activate them.
[71:12.26]The circle that appears is where you're aiming.
[71:14.99]If it turns blue, you can pick up the object in the same manner that you grab objects nearby.
[71:19.69]Pick up what we just sent you through the door.
[71:31.74]when you press the move button the aiming circle that appears will turn blue over items now that you have the target you can move it closer or further away using the small buttons got it you're a natural while still holding the target move your thumb to press the hover button shown on the slide the target will hover in the air
[71:53.07]well done I wish we could afford real plants but our dry martini budget is disproportionate to well everything else now try to hover another target over the chair in front of you another target
[72:14.54]In case you forgot.
[72:16.46]Excellent work.
[72:17.08]Alright.
[72:17.64]Let's try one more if you're feeling frisky.
[72:20.85]Hover the third target over the round table to your right.
[72:33.35]The training slide depicts which button you can use to hover the target over the round table to your right.
[72:38.81]That's what I'm pressing, right?
[72:39.55]I will wait patiently for you to- There we go.
[72:42.19]Well placed.
[72:43.51]Now, there's only one thing we do to targets around here.
[72:47.11]How do you shoot?
[72:47.51]Well, two if you count placing them.
[72:49.72]Pick up the gun.
[72:50.44]Only one.
[72:54.04]Opening drawers and compartments will be instrumental in navigating the various desks you may encounter on all dangerous missions.
[73:01.91]In case you've forgotten how to grab, the training slide should serve as a great reminder.
[73:08.03]Excellent.
[73:09.13]I'll unlock the training slide rail from the projector after you retrieve your new mission from the door.
[73:16.56]It's just...
[73:18.50]These things just... This VR headset cord needs to be, like, three times longer.
[73:25.57]Like, this thing is not long enough.
[73:28.25]It has to plug into a fucking box over here.
[73:30.23]Whatever.
[73:33.19]It's the best I can do right now.
[73:41.48]Give me one second.
[73:43.88]I'm gonna have a fucking meltdown.
[73:51.26]What is this?
[73:52.10]This is dumb.
[73:54.27]Oh, God.
[73:55.55]To unlock the training slides, grab your first mission from the door.
[74:02.11]I swear to fucking God.
[74:04.09]Who would make a cord this long?
[74:06.95]You guys wanna see how long this fucking cord is?
[74:09.10]Look at how stupid this is.
[74:10.70]Look at how dumb this is.
[74:11.58]Look at... Look at this.
[74:16.88]Can you see this?
[74:19.63]It's hovering in the air right now.
[74:23.65]Why is it that long?
[74:24.39]It should be fucking like three times longer than that.
[74:32.00]I swear to God.
[74:32.90]Mike, this is fucking just so obnoxious.
[74:43.93]Oh my God, I swear to God!
[74:46.61]Just hang there.
[74:47.37]I don't even give a fuck right now.
[74:48.95]I don't even care.
[74:50.24]You're a fucking stupid piece of shit PSVR.
[74:53.88]Motherfucker cord is a foot and a half, two feet long.
[74:57.38]And I gotta sit like 20 feet back?
[75:00.70]How am I supposed to get my snacks?
[75:04.24]Hold on a second.
[75:05.44]Give me a minute.
[75:09.25]To unlock the training slides, grab your first mission from the door.
[75:23.68]Wait, what?
[76:00.68]That's the length of the cord.
[76:02.78]For the fucking PSVR.
[76:05.70]Fuck you, Sony.
[76:08.70]Where's my extender cable?
[76:12.24]That's like actually fucking irritating.
[76:21.51]That this thing has to be plugged into a box, then plugged into your PlayStation.
[76:25.73]And the motherfucking cord is two feet long.
[76:35.29]But this is too loud?
[76:41.17]The game, the actual game is loud?
[76:42.93]Oh, I'm... Oops.
[76:55.76]I think I figured out what was going on there.
[77:02.79]Like, you know, sometimes things just fucking piss you off.
[77:06.61]But like, this shit is so not user-friendly at all.
[77:14.92]Like, I have to be sitting fucking, like, five feet away from my screen to use it.
[77:24.51]It's so irritating.
[77:31.12]I'm so sorry that you guys had to hear all that.
[77:36.37]I did lose my temper.
[77:40.87]I did because this is like stupid.
[77:43.07]Like so many of these fucking situations could just be avoided if Discord was like 30% longer.
[77:50.16]Give me a fucking break.
[77:58.12]What a good makeup stream.
[78:01.20]A.K.A.
[78:01.76]stream when nothing happens and I complain about how the PSVR's chords suck.
[78:06.25]I don't know if I can recover from this one, guys.
[78:16.59]We'll try.
[78:17.05]Yeah, I'm so sorry if I fucking ear-destroyed you.
[78:25.70]This thing fell down.
[78:27.76]I've said it already like 50 times.
[78:29.36]Who cares at this point, right?
[78:34.42]Like, you see where I have to sit?
[78:36.72]If I pull back any further, this whole fucking box comes down.
[78:39.52]That it has to be plugged into.
[78:45.66]Like, it's just such an awkward situation.
[78:49.55]Alright, let me, like, turn the volume of this game down.
[78:59.03]This shit could be, like, so fun, too.
[79:01.27]You have to have so many fucking...
[79:07.71]It's once I brought these into play is where the whole stream died.
[79:15.68]Needing to use these just killed the whole stream.
[79:18.96]The whole hour and a half that I've been trying to do this.
[79:24.01]Hold on.
[79:35.49]I think my computer just crashed.
[79:41.76]Am I, like, still alive?
[79:43.68]What the fuck is happening?
[79:51.01]You bring in the... I want to stick out what is going on right now.
[79:56.09]Dude brings in the PlayStation Move controllers and the stream doesn't work.
[80:09.18]Alright, did that help at all?
[80:12.02]Let me know if that helped.
[80:12.78]Is that better?
[80:17.58]PSVR is not cordless.
[80:22.75]Use the 10-foot extender cable.
[80:25.53]Where the fuck is the extender cable?
[80:27.37]What?
[80:30.25]I didn't get an extender cable that came with it.
[80:37.80]I didn't get an extender?
[80:40.58]Alright, there.
[80:45.72]That's better, right?
[80:48.42]We're going back in.
[80:49.56]I'm gonna try this again.
[80:55.37]Okay.
[80:56.39]So, um... You can call this, like, the fucking disaster stream.
[81:03.25]Glad it's going so well.
[81:04.37]Okay.
[81:06.71]I'm not gonna fucking hit anything, right?
[81:10.89]Oh, yeah.
[81:12.31]Fucking move controllers.
[81:13.97]You were the problem.
[81:14.89]You were the cause of this whole thing.
[81:16.79]You did this.
[81:19.13]Alright.
[81:19.87]Give me the mission.
[81:26.51]Where's their mission?

[82:02.82]I streamed VR.
[82:03.60]I've streamed VR for like 25, 30 hours so far.
[82:08.43]And it's like as if I've never done it before.
[82:12.77]No other stream had this many problems on VR.
[82:16.63]I'm going to burn these.
[82:19.03]And drive it right off the airplane.
[82:21.41]Our intel assures us Zo's car is equipped to handle a fall from any height.
[82:26.39]So we're almost positive you won't die.
[82:31.61]Drive car out of plane.
[82:32.95]Okay.
[82:33.17]I'm gonna drive the car off the plane.
[82:44.27]I have to do it like this.
[83:00.93]Drive it off the plane.
[83:02.11]And you may just earn that vacation you're always going on about.
[83:07.78]Okay, drive it off the plane.
[83:11.82]I got a key anywhere?
[83:16.24]Get the window?
[83:17.52]No, I see a screwdriver.
[83:23.90]What does this say?
[83:27.37]This says...
[83:37.16]How to arm your bomb.
[83:39.76]One, two, three.
[83:40.82]Alright, well you stay right over here.
[83:45.49]I need... That ain't gonna work.
[83:48.21]I need to turn the car on first.
[83:51.07]Can I push the door now?
[83:53.81]No, can't get out.
[83:54.47]What is this?
[83:57.92]How do I rotate it?
[84:01.04]That is... Faulty cannon reset system.
[84:06.24]Oh god, hold on.
[84:12.09]Oh dear, alright, well... Can I open up the glove box?
[84:22.49]I don't think so.
[84:22.99]Alright, you need to move over here.
[84:25.07]Oh god, there's a gun right there.
[84:26.05]Okay, what about the gun?
[84:31.21]What are... Beautiful!
[84:34.85]Alright, you go over here.
[84:38.48]This is fucking poison gas!
[84:40.74]It's poison gas!
[84:44.04]Give me the dog bone.
[84:44.76]Alright, there's poison gas.
[84:51.06]Okay.
[84:54.12]Uh, right.

[88:22.43]Like, of course I would.
[88:28.73]I can't, like, go down that far.
[88:31.29]The game, like, the PSVR move controller cannot go that far.
[88:36.99]It will not do it.
[88:38.37]You saw what happened in Batman.

[153:09.94]You know, Babe Ruth once said that.
[153:11.44]It was just a shitload of fucking tech to end like this shit like broke halfway through.
[153:21.69]I started cursing out Sony for their cord.
[153:26.03]They're
[153:28.65]Their tiny fucking cord, which I could scream about again if I really wanted to.
[153:32.43]Yeah, sometimes you have to crack a couple legs to make mayonnaise, you know?
[153:41.49]Don't use the magic wands.
[153:43.65]Well, okay, so these are wireless, and this isn't.
[153:46.19]So it's like, just don't... Whatever.
