[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.53]Hello there.
[00:04.72]How's everybody doing?
[00:07.68]I'm doing pretty good.
[00:09.94]I'm doing swell.
[00:14.10]Welcome to the Nintendo Labo stream.
[00:17.26]Something that I was supposed to do.
[00:20.12]April, May, June, July, August, September, October.
[00:22.92]Six months ago.
[00:23.60]We're in October for Christ's sake.
[00:26.92]Nintendo Labo tonight.
[00:30.30]I have a Switch now.
[00:31.32]I bought a Switch.
[00:34.54]Eight months late.
[00:36.00]That's alright, though.
[00:39.18]You're on vacation.
[00:41.08]Well, fucking clink them, man.
[00:45.47]Just give me one second while I tweak this out, and we'll get started.
[01:42.21]Alright, we're here with my Nintendo Labo.
[01:51.77]Now there is a little bit of a slight catch here with this stream.
[01:54.76]I'll show you in about two seconds, hold on.
[01:59.06]Oh, by the way, if I scream into this mic, right?
[02:05.32]I tried to mess with the compressor.
[02:07.57]So let me know if, hey!
[02:10.24]Is that like worse than before or is it better than before?
[02:12.58]Because I have like a software compressor now.
[02:14.40]Hopefully it's not as loud as it was.
[02:18.48]Better?
[02:20.10]So often I'm just like, whoa!
[02:22.38]What the, what the fudge?
[02:24.50]You guys, that's better, right?
[02:27.26]Replace that word with fuck.
[02:29.20]Somebody edit that in.
[02:29.83]Alright, anyways, hello.
[02:32.43]Here's the Labo stream.
[02:35.84]If you're probably wondering what's going on here, what's on my screen?
[02:39.57]Occam, I don't see anything.
[02:40.63]Well, that's because I didn't click the fucking button.
[02:44.71]So here it is.
[02:46.21]Yes, you can see the switch right there.
[02:48.33]It's right next to my box of tricks right there, right?
[02:52.19]So a couple of important things to note here.
[02:57.76]I didn't buy any of the kits for a couple of very specific reasons.
[03:03.56]First and foremost, I want to do a little bit of a protest against the Nintendo pollution and anti-recycling campaign they've been running.
[03:12.37]What's with the cardboard?
[03:13.22]$70 for cardboard?
[03:15.92]No.
[03:16.72]So what we're going to do here, I bought this used.
[03:20.82]This is the Nintendo Labo Variety Toy-Con one.
[03:25.08]And I figured I'm gonna buy this used.
[03:27.86]I eat a shitload of pizza, like I'm sure we all do.
[03:31.44]I ordered like three or four pizzas here, like maybe 45 minutes ago.
[03:35.73]And we're gonna just use that cardboard, kill two birds with one stone, environmentally conscious, and get to play a game and have some fun with my friends.
[03:44.15]So I've got some pizzas here.
[03:46.91]Let's see, we've got some wrapping paper here.
[03:50.09]We're gonna eat some of these and get this going.
[03:52.43]And those of you that already, hold on a second, like, oh, Jeremy, what about the special tools?
[03:57.97]And you've got to line up the shit and hit the button.
[04:00.29]No, it doesn't matter.
[04:00.99]Look, I've got a Sharpie and a pair of scissors.
[04:04.21]We can make our own damn stencil.
[04:05.60]It doesn't even matter.
[04:07.46]But there is, I think, I ate a bunch of it, but there should be a few slices left.
[04:16.46]Okay.
[04:17.88]There's a couple slices in here, but that's alright.
[04:19.36]We can probably use this as well.
[04:21.79]I'm gonna hold on to that.
[04:24.19]Uh, let's just... Fuck it, let's just sit here and eat.
[04:28.15]Social eating stream just started out, what do you say?
[04:32.77]This pizza's actually pretty good.
[04:36.15]Where do I- I don't even know where I got this from.
[04:37.61]Remember I told you I was never gonna eat on stream?
[04:43.31]Oh, that was a fucking lie.
[04:45.27]Oh-ho-ho!
[04:46.37]You see that shootout?
[04:48.25]I'm already embarrassed.
[04:49.35]I'm embarrassed right now.
[04:50.41]I knew this was gonna happen.
[04:53.17]Damn it, I didn't even get my commemorative cup ready!
[05:05.55]Oh, you piece of shit!
[05:07.43]Oh, you piece of shit, you've ruined my whole joke.
[05:11.36]Come on!
[05:12.54]Are the batteries dead?
[05:13.98]Ugh.
[05:15.98]Whatever, fuck it.
[05:17.30]This is supposed to light up.
[05:20.32]Pretty good pizza, though.
[05:26.82]Alright, so, as you can see, let me demonstrate.
[05:31.54]There's all kinds of stupid bullshit that's going to be on here.
[05:33.99]We're going to have to paint some stuff with a Sharpie, cut it out, wrap it around our Joy-Cons.
[05:40.01]You're not going to be able to tell the difference, okay?
[05:41.73]Do you understand?
[05:42.65]You won't be able to tell the difference.
[05:45.46]Let's just go ahead and start.
[05:49.56]How do I start this?
[05:52.64]Right here, right?
[05:53.56]Make.
[05:56.00]Okay.
[05:57.50]Make.
[05:57.98]First of all, practice.
[06:01.23]Oh shit, you can't even hear it.
[06:06.71]Alright, I got plenty of cardboard here, so we'll be fine.
[06:10.55]It's pre-recorded, huh?
[06:12.13]Press A. Just wait, I need to make sure you can fucking hear it.
[06:17.81]I'm gonna get wet in your greasy hands.
[06:19.49]Shit, I just bought this thing, I don't wanna ruin it.
[06:21.36]Alright, press A.
[06:28.84]So what are we going to make first?
[06:33.18]Fuck, I gotta hear this.
[06:35.07]Is it talking?
[06:36.51]Is the guy talking?
[06:37.23]Alright, let's make.
[06:40.71]Hold the A button to go forward.
[06:46.05]Make a Joy-Con holder.
[06:47.95]Hold the A button to go forward.
[06:49.24]Okay.
[06:56.98]What is it showing me here?
[07:00.19]Okay, hold it in your butt.
[07:01.11]There it is.
[07:02.15]Remove just this one part from the sheet.
[07:04.78]Be careful not to bend anything.
[07:12.22]Okay, so what does it look like?
[07:18.15]It's like a big dump truck in the end here.
[07:25.43]We're being environmentally friendly, guys.
[07:28.26]Maybe some other streamers aren't as environmentally conscious as I am.
[07:34.52]Down.
[07:34.86]Around like that.
[07:39.72]And then down again, right?
[07:42.35]Little bump.
[07:43.45]Right?
[07:43.69]I'm doing this right, right?
[07:45.99]Bump right there.
[07:47.03]Long line.
[07:48.51]Bump right here.
[07:50.55]Over.
[07:51.27]Up.
[07:53.93]And that goes up again.
[07:55.77]To the top.
[07:58.10]Oh, good thing I spent $70 on this.
[08:02.64]Okay, there we go.
[08:03.68]Remove this piece.
[08:04.72]Wait, we're going to add this.
[08:08.42]Right?
[08:10.54]Okay, too big.
[08:11.14]That's not too big.
[08:13.38]Make sure I got everything there.
[08:14.10]Okay, remove this piece.
[08:14.84]You got it.
[08:20.00]Watch this shit.
[08:23.74]I can't waste cardboard, though.
[08:25.32]I don't want to use...
[08:30.09]Alright, don't fuck this up.
[08:31.36]I gotta hold onto this piece too.
[08:32.44]$70 my ass, huh?
[08:39.58]Just wait a minute.
[08:40.56]Alright, hold onto this piece.
[08:56.53]You're gonna use that later.
[09:02.94]Alright.
[09:03.78]Get the little tab out.
[09:04.62]You guys can see this, right?
[09:09.88]This music.
[09:11.79]I just spit that all over my mouth.
[09:12.99]This is why I don't eat on stream.
[09:15.39]Oh, fuck.
[09:15.99]I already squirted up a little bit.
[09:16.85]No, I didn't.
[09:17.13]That's fine.
[09:32.23]Let's get it out and we can do the nuance shit later.
[09:40.59]Cut out.
[09:43.13]Come on, you fucking piece of shit pizza ball.
[09:46.56]Did the pizza just fall down?
[09:48.92]What just fell?
[09:51.34]What just fell down?
[09:52.04]What do you mean it's wrong?
[09:54.92]No, it's not.
[09:55.42]Look.
[09:56.64]I'll hold it up to the camera in a second.
[09:57.90]You think it's wrong, but trust me.
[09:59.08]I've got the...
[10:00.67]I've got the algorithms in my brain.
[10:01.97]Trust me about that.
[10:02.69]I think you might have an arts and crafts dream.
[10:10.17]This is what you're doing here.
[10:11.07]This is what you're going to get.
[10:20.40]Authentic Italian flavor.
[10:23.02]That's good.
[10:33.46]Change game to creative.
[10:34.58]Well, no, this is Nintendo Labo.
[10:36.22]It has its own category.
[10:37.05]I don't have to do that.
[10:41.53]You guys think you're gonna make fun of me for this.
[10:43.01]This is gonna work.
[10:44.93]Beautifully, actually.
[10:45.95]Get up there, you motherfucker.
[10:54.12]This is spitting out more food.
[10:57.72]I can't go to restaurants either.
[10:59.46]Nobody can take me anywhere.
[11:01.55]I'm one of those people that will put a bunch of food in their mouth and then fucking laugh hysterically out loud, like, and it'll just spit in the person's face in front of me.
[11:09.76]I am just like an obnoxious, uncontrollable fucking loser.
[11:13.40]Like, you can't take me anywhere.
[11:17.06]The joke didn't even need to be that funny.
[11:18.18]Alright, how far across does this go?
[11:24.36]This?
[11:25.92]Oh, this is getting tight.
[11:28.82]Did I fuck it up?
[11:29.44]No, I didn't.
[11:31.11]No, I'm good.
[11:31.39]Come across this way.
[11:33.47]Alright, get it out.
[12:01.07]We got it.
[12:02.67]That's all, right?
[12:04.63]That's correct.
[12:07.39]Alright, now what do I do?
[12:11.10]Get over here.
[12:15.58]We gotta go forward now, okay.
[12:21.36]Hold the A button to go forward.
[12:24.69]We'll use the other pieces later.
[12:25.87]In the meantime, keep sheet A stored safely in the box.
[12:29.35]I don't have that shit.
[12:36.02]You can also build a toy con in handheld mode.
[12:38.28]The touchscreen makes building easy.
[12:39.70]Alright.
[12:42.28]What did you say?
[12:46.26]You rotate the camera with L and R. Okay, so this is our piece here.
[12:50.08]Get out of the fucking way.
[12:51.42]Everybody out of the way.
[12:54.42]Pizza, get out of here.
[12:55.04]I'll get you in a minute.
[12:57.10]Commemorative cup.
[12:57.88]You didn't get to see how funny that was.
[12:59.42]It was really funny.
[13:00.38]Trust me.
[13:00.70]Okay, here you go.
[13:02.14]I mean, of course I have a thing that blends in.
[13:04.50]Alright, I'm ready.
[13:16.49]You can zoom by holding Z and tilting.
[13:19.63]Okay, there's the zoom.
[13:22.47]Move the camera by any direction by holding L and R and tilting.
[13:26.83]Move the camera.
[13:28.51]Okay, there we go.
[13:31.01]Excellent.
[13:31.47]You guys can see that up there, right?
[13:32.49]You can reset the camera with X. Alright.
[13:38.56]Let's take a good look at the screen to make sure it matches what you're building.
[13:41.00]So this has got to go this way.
[13:41.92]Alright.
[13:45.46]Pretty much.
[13:48.26]I think that that's pretty accurate.
[13:51.36]Notice the back and front are different with the printed side facing down.
[13:57.92]Printed side down.
[14:00.61]Yeah, so this is the printed side.
[14:01.81]That's where the pizza, like authentic Italian is.
[14:04.67]That's fine.
[14:07.11]That looks, look at how perfect that looks.
[14:08.61]You guys, come on.
[14:09.69]Give me some credit for that.
[14:12.50]The key to good Toy-Con construction is to crease firmly along the fold lines.
[14:16.76]Always check where the fold lines are.
[15:16.98]Alright, what am I doing?
[15:20.27]Okay.
[15:23.09]Go forward.
[15:25.21]Crease them nicely and firmly.
[15:26.58]That comes up.
[15:31.02]That comes up.
[15:48.52]Alright, looking good so far.
[15:50.59]This comes up and around.
[15:56.59]It's pretty firm.
[15:57.25]Alright, that looks okay.
[16:01.75]Go forward.
[16:04.68]If the folded piece stands up on its own, that's a good sign.
[16:07.38]Don't worry if it doesn't stand perfectly straight, though.
[16:12.00]Oh, you mean like that?
[16:13.12]I'm already way ahead of you, Nintendo.
[16:20.97]Alright, spin it around.
[16:21.79]There are a bunch of foldable creases.
[16:23.41]Carefully fold them one by one.
[16:25.83]Oh, hold on.
[16:26.55]Slow down.
[16:31.20]That's this piece.
[16:32.54]Where the fuck am I?
[16:33.32]Right here.
[16:34.64]Right at the edge.
[16:35.22]The last one there.
[16:41.30]Yep.
[16:41.42]Let's get that folded.
[16:46.93]See what I'm doing here.
[16:52.59]It's pretty good like that.
[16:53.99]Needs to stand up on its own, right?
[16:58.07]Nope.
[16:59.13]Oh, we're fine.
[16:59.80]Nothing happened.
[17:01.88]Just like that.
[17:04.76]It's going to stand up.
[17:13.28]Alright, now we do that one and then we do this next piece right here, this piece, this one that folds down.
[17:21.70]Well, I already broke it, so it's fine.
[17:23.46]I didn't break it.
[17:24.08]I just, I made it better.
[17:26.78]That folds.
[17:29.02]Like that, okay.
[17:30.42]So these have been folded correctly.
[17:32.66]So this comes down like this, see?
[17:33.80]Okay, now what?
[17:40.37]I gotta do them all.
[17:42.67]Okay, that's not that hard.
[17:45.11]You just gotta get them all, you gotta get them all ready.
[17:47.27]Can you even see what I'm doing?
[17:54.83]That's been folded.
[17:55.53]This has been folded.
[17:56.33]That's been done.
[17:57.03]Okay, now what's left?
[18:03.10]See how much easier it is if you crease all the fold lines at the beginning?
[18:07.48]Yeah.
[18:07.94]I mean, I guess.
[18:09.78]Okay.
[18:09.90]Okay.
[18:20.32]This part is called the tab.
[18:21.74]It'll be very important to your building process.
[18:23.77]That's right here.
[18:24.27]Okay.
[18:30.76]Carefully insert the tab into the opening.
[18:32.12]Make sure it doesn't get bent out of shape.
[18:55.62]I don't get it, hold on.
[19:02.49]Who says you need it?
[19:03.55]I got it, I got it, don't worry, everybody calm down.
[19:06.81]So get the tab in here like this.
[19:11.23]I do the same shit to cereal boxes.
[19:12.99]Even if this was a real Labo, it wouldn't be able to do it.
[19:18.00]You try to open up, look, you get really excited, you wanna open up the Captain Crunch as fast as you fucking can.
[19:26.20]There it is.
[19:26.52]Got it.
[19:27.76]It's in.
[19:30.70]Okay.
[19:31.76]Next step.
[19:32.16]Flip it upside down like that.
[19:40.27]This comes across.
[19:41.25]Alright.
[19:41.53]So that comes across.
[19:45.83]Like that.
[19:49.29]Okay.
[19:49.87]There's another tab.
[19:50.75]It's this one right here.
[19:54.07]Okay.
[19:54.25]I see where it goes.
[19:56.10]Right there.
[20:02.05]I'm doing this like way too close to my penis right now with like a blade.
[20:05.57]I should probably not do this.
[20:06.83]Alright, now I'll just freak myself out.
[20:14.14]Okay.
[20:16.08]Get it in there.
[20:21.14]And it's in there perfectly.
[20:22.58]It fits perfectly.
[20:24.60]Alright, let's keep going.
[20:28.07]Congratulations, you did it!
[20:30.57]Your Joy-Con holder is complete!
[20:39.71]There it is!
[20:41.71]Now let's attach the Joy-Con controllers.
[20:43.51]Have the Joy-Con ready.
[20:45.77]This one.
[20:47.57]So now that goes up and in.
[20:50.17]Be sure to push the Joy-Con all the way down.
[20:51.67]Can you see the button through the back, the hole in the back?
[21:02.59]I sure don't!
[21:05.19]It's alright.
[21:06.23]Gotta cut a hole in the back.
[21:13.16]Get your finger in there, that's all you need.
[21:23.27]It's just a finger, that's all you need.
[21:33.76]There it is, baby.
[21:35.56]Joy-Con holder.
[21:36.49]Alright, it's starting to go to shit.
[21:43.27]It's the grease that's doing it.
[21:44.31]Alright.
[21:45.33]Yes, I can do it.
[21:47.45]I did it.
[21:48.73]That's it for practice.
[21:58.90]You need to buy $70 worth of shit.
[22:03.89]Do the real thing.
[22:06.29]Start it off.
[22:07.03]Blast off!
[22:13.41]Do I need to hold on to this now for the rest of the time?
[22:18.66]No, the whole thing will end up.
[22:21.30]We're doing the motorcycle first off.
[22:27.27]Motorcycle.
[22:29.43]Piano?
[22:34.81]RC car.
[22:36.45]Fishing, we're doing the fishing rod.
[22:39.84]150 minutes?
[22:42.65]Holy shit, that's a long time.
[23:02.81]Five steps to complete.
[23:04.72]Grab the special parts in the plastic bag.
[23:06.63]You don't need to open the bag yet.
[23:37.50]Hi, yeah, I'd like to place an order, please, for takeout.
[23:46.11]Yeah.
[23:46.47]Yeah, can I get two large Nintendo Labo variety kits?
[23:54.64]Yeah.
[23:55.12]You guys do, like, the pizza thing, right?
[23:56.40]Where, like, it comes in, like, less than 30 minutes on one of those stupid little shitty drones?
[23:59.28]Okay.
[24:04.19]Really?
[24:04.87]That quickly?
[24:08.07]Holy shit.
[24:10.85]Alright, no.
[24:11.67]Thank you.
[24:14.11]How much is that to get that?
[24:16.17]Less than five minutes.
[24:16.93]How much is that?
[24:21.24]Okay.
[24:23.70]That's a lot of fucking money.
[24:25.64]I'm sorry for swearing, but... Yeah, go ahead.
[24:28.41]You got my credit card on file, Mr. Amazon.
[24:30.17]Get it.
[24:32.35]Thank you.
[24:33.45]Okay, see you soon.
[24:40.52]70 dollars for each variety kit and to get the to get the Amazon uh drone delivery it was a 444 plus tax so turns out it was uh not worth it to do the pizza box but whatever I'm not I'm not going to be that concerned about it we can at least have some fun with it right that's all I care
[25:09.94]Fucking Amazon drone, baby!
[25:14.07]I'll be right back.
[25:46.53]Look, I'm not going to tip you.
[25:47.73]I'm not going to tip the robot.
[25:51.45]You just came over and picked up the robot and put it off my doorstep because it fell down.
[25:55.95]Now, I don't tip anybody, okay?
[25:57.83]It's a stupid American social contract because they don't want to pay their employees a livable wage so that I have to pay it.
[26:04.19]No, you picked it up so you go.
[26:08.33]You'd be lucky I don't smash that thing.
[26:13.52]Sorry about that.
[26:18.42]Hey!
[26:19.22]Nintendo Labo.
[26:22.33]Here we go.
[26:22.83]That guy was an asshole.
[26:32.40]Let's get the real deal up here.
[26:33.88]That was quick.
[26:34.48]$500, well spent.
[26:44.98]I gotta put this away.
[26:45.70]Get over there.
[26:46.04]There's no fucking mice come in here and fight me.
[26:48.38]Alright, Nintendo Labo.
[26:50.54]Let's do it.
[26:51.00]Didn't think I had the fucking real deal.
[27:01.61]So what do I need?
[27:03.59]Five steps to do the fishing rod.
[27:05.99]You better believe it.
[27:12.46]Ooh, unboxing video.
[27:16.72]See, this is just a fucking, look at how red I am.
[27:20.58]Do you see how red this is?
[27:23.02]It's like 100 degrees in here.
[27:24.28]You guys thought I was kidding when I was talking about there's no AC down here.
[27:27.50]I'm smoking in here.
[27:28.76]Alright, what do I need?
[27:30.08]I need a, get that out of the way.
[27:35.34]So this is this.
[27:36.82]I need the accessory kit, right?
[27:39.63]Put that over here.
[27:44.30]This is it, right?
[27:46.90]Which one is the right one?
[27:50.04]It's this one.
[27:50.70]This is the Labo Nintendo.
[27:53.20]A... I have no fucking idea.
[27:59.07]It's this one.
[27:59.97]I gotta store these ones for later.
[28:06.43]This is a big project!
[28:10.73]Oh my fucking god!
[28:14.28]This is such a big fucking project.
[28:19.30]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[28:22.30]Okay.
[28:26.26]I think this is it.
[28:26.88]I'm gonna like open my window.
[28:31.04]I'm seriously gonna suffocate in here.
[28:38.40]Don't make fun of my legs.
[28:40.02]They're hairy and they're small.
[28:41.44]Deal with it.
[28:42.49]Alright, no pizza grease here.
[28:44.31]There's a ton, but who cares?
[28:45.25]Let's start with A. Put this shit down here, I can use it later.
[28:52.88]Alright, I'm ready.
[28:54.76]There are five steps to complete this.
[28:56.58]You guys can hear this, right?
[29:01.08]Tiny legs.
[29:03.81]I'm starting to look like, or actually I do have a sunburn.
[29:07.35]Alright, let's go.
[29:09.76]Grab the special parts.
[29:10.54]I got the kit right here.
[29:12.12]Make sure you can see this.
[29:12.88]Get this fucking money in the camera, right?
[29:16.76]Good.
[29:18.02]And no, for everyone that's freaking out, I'm not going to dump this on here.
[29:21.81]I'm not going to accidentally drop this and dump it on here.
[29:25.31]Fucking AC just turned on.
[29:26.99]Good thing it's not going to come into here.
[29:31.93]That's not dumping on there.
[29:32.89]I know a lot of people see the drink and they're like, ah, that's dumping on the pride.
[29:36.57]No, it's not.
[29:37.11]Okay, here we go.
[29:39.23]My cans are a little greasy, but it's fine.
[29:43.34]One out of five.
[29:45.64]Making the rod.
[29:53.84]Remove these five parts from sheet A and B. Isn't a nine year old supposed to be able to do this?
[30:02.37]A and B. I need a bigger work zone.
[30:10.03]Hands.
[30:12.89]Okay, I need to remove these five parts from A and B. So obviously it's the two cartridges with the little things over here.
[30:20.50]Do I need the scissors for this?
[30:24.80]These just pop right out.
[30:27.52]Alright, make sure I don't break it.
[30:31.50]This feels so delicate, I feel like I'm gonna break it.
[30:34.44]I kinda want the pizza box back.
[30:36.00]Now I'm scared to do this.
[30:46.18]Alright, got it.
[30:48.30]I think I need to turn the gain up on this camera.
[30:50.32]Right?
[30:50.90]This one.
[30:51.94]Look, I'm not even that red.
[30:53.26]Do you see, like, this camera that's just blown out?
[30:56.17]I'm not, like, that red.
[30:57.11]It just looks like, because this camera sucks.
[31:00.25]The one that I have over there is a piece of shit.
[31:01.81]And I have a sunburn.
[31:03.77]Alright, let me, uh, let me do this.
[31:07.27]So you guys can actually see what the fuck I'm doing.
[31:13.23]That's a little bit better, right?
[31:15.84]You can actually see what the hell I'm doing now?
[31:17.28]Yeah, that's better.
[31:21.20]Looking good.
[31:22.58]Code red.
[31:23.68]Now, I'm going to change that.
[31:24.88]I don't like that.
[31:25.54]I'm going to make myself not look so fucking red.
[31:32.32]I can't.
[31:33.86]I can't do it.
[31:37.46]There, that's better.
[31:38.12]See?
[31:40.00]See, I'm not even that red.
[31:41.32]Alright, here we go.
[31:46.33]I need this one.
[31:47.09]I need the middle.
[31:49.61]Do I need the middle piece?
[31:50.41]No.
[31:50.63]No middle piece.
[31:51.22]Don't take it out yet.
[31:52.96]Just this little, this guy right here.
[31:58.12]So when you're done building this, it's over, right?
[31:59.96]You just throw it in the trash?
[32:01.96]Recycling.
[32:02.54]Recycling.
[32:03.16]Don't say trash.
[32:04.59]Recycle.
[32:06.17]You just throw it into the trash.
[32:12.49]Pop it out there.
[32:15.46]Should I get close?
[32:16.36]Did I do too much?
[32:16.84]I did too much, didn't I?
[32:19.92]No, I'm good.
[32:22.32]Like, I'm scared to do this because it's really a one and done, man.
[32:25.00]If you fuck this up, you don't get another piece.
[32:26.64]I'm gonna have to actually cut it out of the pizza box.
[32:32.43]Okay, so there's this one.
[32:34.45]One, two.
[32:37.05]Now I can throw this into trash.
[32:38.93]Alright, that's fine.
[32:41.61]One, two pieces.
[32:42.57]Put this down.
[32:43.19]I'm gonna need it, so I'm gonna put it down here.
[32:49.21]Alright, now I need the big middle piece and then the two little tiny pieces.
[32:51.77]Good to go.
[32:52.09]Do I need the musical notes yet?
[32:58.42]Doesn't look like it.
[33:02.32]It's the little one right here that's going to be a pain in the ass, but that's fine.
[33:09.13]This is supposed to take two hours.
[33:12.09]It's going to take me all stream to do this.
[33:15.17]Because I know a lot of people that have younger brothers and siblings and friends.
[33:20.39]Those of you with really, really steady hands, I don't have that.
[33:25.01]This might take me a couple of months of streams to do this.
[33:28.94]Piece by piece, one by one, very slowly.
[33:30.82]I'm going to estimate maybe like two or three months.
[33:36.86]That's paranoid.
[33:37.44]Alright.
[33:38.46]That comes out.
[33:41.62]What an interesting idea, though, huh, Nintendo?
[33:45.52]Add this to the other three games that are on the platform that are worth buying right now.
[33:54.64]I'm sorry.
[34:02.99]It's a good system.
[34:03.85]Look, it's a good system.
[34:04.75]It is.
[34:05.27]The Switch is cool.
[34:06.73]You can pick it up.
[34:07.49]You can take a shit.
[34:08.31]You can go on airplanes with it.
[34:11.11]You can play Hollow Knight on it and Super Mario 14.
[34:14.29]Alright, what else do I need?
[34:18.12]That's it, right now I need these two pieces.
[34:25.48]Right, okay.
[34:28.50]Can't be too rough with it.
[34:29.30]It feels like if I'm too rough, I'll really not be happy about that.
[34:33.47]Alright, get that out.
[34:35.19]And then take out the, I gotta get like the e-cigarette, right?
[34:38.95]The vaping kit.
[34:52.47]Did I rip it?
[34:52.92]No.
[34:55.50]Okay, that's it, right?
[34:56.60]Remove these five parts.
[34:58.80]I was gonna throw it, but don't do that.
[35:00.78]It's not that funny.
[35:01.98]Don't do that.
[35:03.20]Okay, I'm ready to put it together, man.
[35:04.93]Let's go.
[35:05.35]The game dev in the chat.
[35:12.83]I got them all.
[35:13.39]One, two, three, four, five.
[35:14.49]One, two, three, four, five.
[35:26.48]Don't smoke though.
[35:29.28]Don't do it.
[35:29.66]What am I doing?
[35:38.79]Go.
[35:40.55]I'm making a fucking reference to some streamers that you might watch.
[35:46.55]That fucking take a huge hit and like blow their beekeeping smoke over here.
[35:54.02]Whatever.
[35:55.96]Alright, and remove this one piece from sheet C. A, B, C, D, E, F. Where's C?
[36:09.41]I'm gonna lose so much fucking track of this.
[36:11.23]Okay, it's this one right here.
[36:13.65]This better be fun.
[36:14.91]Or I'm going to return it.
[36:16.59]Screaming.
[36:19.04]Can you even return this?
[36:20.90]It's not a real returnable item, is it?
[36:24.74]Yeah, I opened up all the cardboard, I put it together, had a bunch of fun, but I didn't like it.
[36:30.35]Take it back.
[36:33.61]The hole has to come out of the middle?
[36:35.85]Maybe?
[36:36.45]Take care not to bend this one.
[36:37.77]I didn't bend it.
[36:39.37]Get off my back, Nintendo.
[36:40.37]Alright, I think we're ready.
[36:50.38]Don't forget, if you have any trouble, you can use the back and forward buttons to check how everything fits together.
[36:58.27]The rod has three parts.
[36:59.79]Papa bear, mama bear, and baby bear.
[37:05.91]I need to wipe the sweat off my head.
[37:08.58]Here we go.
[37:10.82]This side's cleaner.
[37:13.46]Jesus Christ.
[37:14.62]It's because I just ate pizza.
[37:16.90]I don't even eat pizza.
[37:19.40]It's bad for you.
[37:20.14]Don't eat any pizza.
[37:21.80]Only eat nuts, walnuts, and greens, and heavy liquids.
[37:27.18]OK.
[37:30.82]start with the first piece there are three similar pieces this one is the smallest which is why it's called baby bear I assume this is baby bear right don't get it wrong alright so here they are big medium small don't dump that I'm not that's not a joke for the stream people are waiting for that trust me this is not a stream joke
[37:56.93]Actually, it was.
[37:58.69]It actually was.
[38:00.49]Because this thing's supposed to light up.
[38:02.66]And I was going to have it just glowing the whole time.
[38:04.48]But apparently the batteries are dead.
[38:06.10]I got this on vacation.
[38:07.06]It was a fucking dumbass tourist.
[38:10.38]Tourist?
[38:12.44]Tourist.
[38:13.58]I was a damn tourist.
[38:15.12]Alright.
[38:15.74]Small one.
[38:16.38]Don't lose concentration here.
[38:17.78]You can't do that.
[38:20.13]I'm the worst person to possibly do something like this.
[38:24.03]Where is it?
[38:24.35]This one.
[38:24.65]Alright.
[38:25.59]Baby bear.
[38:29.49]Make sure the piece is the right way up.
[38:31.03]Notice which side is printing on it.
[38:34.05]I got it.
[38:35.37]Relax.
[38:38.61]So this does have a ton of folding lines.
[38:40.11]Let me get in there so you can see.
[38:43.13]This is designed for you to fold in these very specific places.
[38:47.90]Printed side face down like that.
[38:49.82]Get all this shit out of the way before I have a meltdown.
[38:53.06]I need like three more tables.
[38:56.10]Get out of my way before I dump the drink on you on purpose.
[38:59.40]There.
[39:00.20]Okay.
[39:00.32]What are we doing first?
[39:02.14]The key to good Toy-Con construction is to crease firmly along the fold lines.
[39:06.85]Always check where the fold... I know.
[39:08.81]You did this in the tutorial.
[39:11.11]Let's fold along the main fold lines so they're well creased.
[39:13.60]Fold across all the lines.
[39:16.46]Should I skip ahead?
[39:20.56]Should I just do them all?
[39:32.75]Why am I showing you these little things?
[39:34.27]Alright, that's good.
[39:37.27]Let's get the next one, right?
[39:38.77]No, no, no, no, no, no, go back.
[39:43.32]Carefully fold along the creases, one end firmly down.
[39:45.50]I just have to do them all.
[39:47.68]It's this one.
[39:54.20]I'm gonna rip this shit, I know it.
[39:55.80]70 fucking dollars.
[39:58.64]This is gonna be down the drain in about 10 seconds.
[40:03.66]How did I ruin it?
[40:04.20]What do you mean ruined?
[40:06.12]I didn't ruin it.
[40:06.64]What are you talking about?
[40:07.42]This is not ruined.
[40:09.08]This is perfectly fine.
[40:12.09]I didn't ruin it.
[40:12.91]I folded where it said to fold.
[40:16.89]See, look at that.
[40:17.33]I did the big crease where the HDMI cable goes.
[40:19.39]Now we have to do the one before the big fat one, which is this one.
[40:24.09]That one for all you viewers at home.
[40:30.88]all you viewers at home it's this one if you know if you're playing along and we're doing it together this one's hard okay holes I'll deal with those later this is ready to go that one this one that one okay what does it say three hours I'll do this in 30 minutes
[40:57.61]Oh, by the way, we're gonna do a speedrun.
[40:59.35]So, then, whatever the next, the piano, I'm gonna do that in 15 minutes.
[41:03.33]Just, you're gonna have to time it.
[41:04.33]Alright, all the fo- Just do them all, I just have to do them all, right?
[41:08.11]Every single one of them.
[41:12.47]Okay, wait, wait, wait, go back.
[41:15.61]We're gonna do a Nintendo Labo speedrun on the piano.
[41:20.23]Alright, I don't appreciate it.
[41:21.21]I don't appreciate the fucking middle finger here in Nintendo.
[41:24.99]It's just like...
[41:33.19]Whatever.
[41:34.11]Okay, I gotta fold.
[41:35.29]Fold.
[41:36.19]Fold in the pinky.
[41:37.25]Like that.
[41:46.37]That's not even funny.
[41:47.03]I'm not gonna do that again.
[41:50.42]And the big one comes down.
[41:51.52]Do they both come down?
[41:53.72]No, just this one.
[41:58.22]Close the toilet seat.
[42:00.98]Like that.
[42:03.15]Okay.
[42:05.15]Now let's put it together, right?
[42:07.43]Time to build it.
[42:07.99]So first little flap comes up before the HDMI cable.
[42:13.33]That's this one.
[42:22.91]No, I'm fine.
[42:23.43]It's okay.
[42:35.50]Ate it.
[42:36.68]Wouldn't have been that hard.
[42:38.84]I had a sneeze.
[42:41.62]Sorry about that.
[42:43.92]See?
[42:44.56]Gone.
[42:46.72]Alright, so let's fold this.
[42:47.82]Hold on.
[42:48.08]Wait, wait, wait.
[42:48.42]Slow down, you fucking dumb game.
[42:49.70]Alright, fold in.
[42:51.31]Roll like a rolling pin.
[42:52.63]So now this comes up here.
[42:55.31]Like that.
[43:00.69]This closes up here.
[43:03.57]Like, hold on, I gotta fold this again.
[43:05.27]Alright, that's like this.
[43:10.09]Right, like that.
[43:15.46]The tab comes down and in.
[43:18.24]Snap it in.
[43:20.46]Didn't even fold this one yet.
[43:22.54]What a fuckin' amateur.
[43:23.44]Alright, let's see if we can get that nice, nice fuckin' click.
[43:30.51]For all you audiosyncratic media rights.
[43:46.70]You did not fold it.
[43:49.65]I'm fine.
[43:50.03]Look, we're good.
[43:50.39]No, no, we're good.
[43:50.79]We're good.
[43:51.03]Look.
[43:53.89]That looks good.
[43:56.25]I'm just making like a little giant e-cigarette.
[43:58.49]I can't make that same reference twice.
[44:01.24]You said it once.
[44:02.50]You don't have to say it again.
[44:03.44]Alright.
[44:04.62]So there we go.
[44:05.64]Next one has to fold up.
[44:08.21]I hate these little controllers.
[44:09.33]I can't touch them.
[44:10.05]I can't even hold them.
[44:11.29]I hate this shit.
[44:12.45]I don't like that.
[44:13.59]Like when you play with two people and you have to go like this, if I want to press right on this controller, I can't because it like bumps into my thumb when I'm pressing B. I do, it looks cute.
[44:24.75]It's a little slice.
[44:25.52]It looks like a little ice cream sandwich.
[44:27.18]That's nice.
[44:27.66]That's fine.
[44:31.22]Playing double player on it, man.
[44:32.86]You can only really use the blue one when you're doing double player.
[44:35.66]There's enough spacing there.
[44:38.87]Alright, let's go.
[44:39.93]Wait, wait, wait, back up, back up.
[44:43.12]Enter the tab securely.
[44:44.50]Swing it around.
[44:45.72]Close the lid.
[44:46.80]Check the steps carefully.
[44:48.02]Use back if you want to re-watch the video.
[44:49.38]I don't have to.
[44:49.92]So that comes down and in.
[44:51.12]So this comes down and in.
[44:54.98]Like this.
[44:57.06]So it goes... You can't even see that.
[45:04.52]Down and in.
[45:09.30]Look at that.
[45:11.44]Look at that, okay.
[45:13.72]This is kind of fun.
[45:16.48]And then through rings go, ooh, interesting.
[45:19.84]Okay, so now comes those, the two rings, the glasses come down.
[45:23.82]The 3D glasses go in like this.
[45:31.38]In like that, like that.
[45:37.28]So this is now complete.
[45:43.88]Oh shit, now we're gonna add an eyelet.
[45:45.98]It's made up of two pieces, the grommet and the washer.
[45:52.54]Alright, speed run to open the package.
[46:04.93]Time!
[46:08.13]Okay, what do I do?
[46:11.29]Wait, I didn't get this one.
[46:18.35]Okay, I need the grommet and I need the wa- I don't ruin this package too.
[46:22.40]A monumental dickhead.
[46:23.54]This game better be fun.
[46:28.00]Whatever I make out of this, better be a bestseller.
[46:30.84]You know what, just fucking open the damn thing.
[46:32.34]Alright, I need a... Now we're going to add an eyelid.
[46:36.16]It's made up of two pieces of grommet on the left and a washer on the right.
[46:38.87]So we need a grommet and a washer.
[46:43.83]Why is there a big spaghetti in here?
[46:46.73]One of these, right?
[46:47.79]Am I correct in thinking that that's a washer?
[46:49.85]That is, right?
[46:51.29]So put that here.
[46:53.51]So you can see.
[46:54.15]Okay.
[46:55.38]And then we need a grommet.
[46:57.72]Like that.
[46:58.22]Like this.
[46:59.62]Okay.
[47:01.14]Easy.
[47:02.28]Let's go.
[47:06.28]Take the blue grommet and washer out of the plastic bag.
[47:08.87]Already did it!
[47:18.93]Press the grommet through the hole.
[47:20.13]Be sure to point it the right way.
[47:21.47]That's kind of cool.
[47:24.11]Oh, shit.
[47:24.47]I forgot to take off the little nipples there.
[47:38.48]So this goes through here like this.
[47:39.96]Is that going the right way?
[47:44.36]Yeah.
[47:45.10]Through here.
[47:48.32]Do them both.
[47:48.94]That's correct.
[47:53.06]And then the washer's going to screw onto here.
[47:55.94]The two eyelet pieces should now snap neatly together like this.
[47:59.36]If they don't, you screwed up and should rethink your life choices, okay?
[48:05.50]Jesus.
[48:05.82]Okay, Nintendo, whatever you say.
[48:08.20]I think it's this way.
[48:09.68]Like this.
[48:18.60]Got it.
[48:27.80]It's going to be kind of a cigarette joke.
[48:29.54]That's all I can think of today.
[48:30.64]Hey, everything's a fucking cigarette.
[48:32.91]What do you say?
[48:35.57]Whatever.
[48:35.89]Alright.
[48:36.27]I got it.
[48:39.05]Snap the wash rod firmly.
[48:40.27]Just did that.
[48:41.83]If you snap it the wrong way, you can ask an adult to pop it apart with a coin.
[48:49.45]Just in case you aren't one.
[48:52.13]But what do you do if you are an adult and you still can't do it?
[48:58.30]Call an ambulance.
[49:01.98]Maybe they'll help you.
[49:03.66]Alright, we get the last piece here.
[49:11.22]Now, put a fold in the tab on the tail and it's ready to go.
[49:15.88]This is kind of, I don't like, this is, mine's fucked up.
[49:19.34]Isn't it?
[49:21.74]What's with this space here?
[49:23.66]See the little space?
[49:24.46]This is not perfect.
[49:25.56]I refuse to put it into circulation.
[49:27.90]It's not perfect.
[49:30.58]Tab is up.
[49:35.03]It is ruined.
[49:36.73]I didn't fold it perfect enough.
[49:37.81]Now I'm pissed off about it.
[49:40.45]Whatever.
[49:40.73]Alright, this one's ready to go.
[49:42.59]Baby bear is done.
[49:49.52]Now let's make medium-sized mama bear.
[49:52.02]We're doing the same exact thing.
[49:54.38]Put that over on the side here.
[49:56.33]Actually, I want you to be able to see all the finished products.
[49:58.27]We're going to put that right there so you can see it.
[50:00.87]This is baby bear.
[50:01.73]Don't let me forget that.
[50:04.05]Here comes the rest of the Goldilocks troop.
[50:07.02]Okay, here it comes.
[50:07.80]Baby bear, medium-sized bear.
[50:12.16]You know, I was actually thinking of, like, what a funny joke might be.
[50:14.82]Is being like, okay, here's the Nintendo Labo.
[50:16.66]Are we ready, guys?
[50:17.66]Here it comes!
[50:19.04]And then just burn it in front of you.
[50:21.93]I was gonna do, I'm like, no, I can't do that, though, because, like, the fire alarm will go off.
[50:27.61]Like, oh, yeah, do you make the fishing rod?
[50:29.15]Oh, yeah.
[50:30.77]And, like, hold it and just be like, this is what I fucking think about that.
[50:33.49]There's laws behind why you can't, not allowed to do that shit.
[50:38.10]Alright, Mama Bear.
[50:41.73]It's this one.
[50:42.95]I think we're gonna do this exact same thing, so.
[50:45.79]Yeah, flip it over.
[50:47.71]There it is.
[50:48.77]Fold every crease line.
[50:50.45]Sure thing, yeah.
[50:51.86]Just make it happen.
[50:52.72]Don't go too rough with it though.
[50:55.52]Did I break it?
[50:57.18]No.
[50:57.24]It's fine right there.
[50:58.78]You know what?
[51:01.16]I think the problem is I'm not creasing them hard enough.
[51:04.86]They need much more creasing.
[51:07.68]I was gently just being like, oh, hold on, let me just like close it.
[51:11.00]Can't do that, it's gotta be for real.
[51:20.45]There, right, yeah, got it.
[51:24.57]Use your muscle, I'm trying.
[51:26.17]I got a little pizza grease on it already, but that's alright.
[51:31.79]Okay, there's that one, that one's done.
[51:33.59]Last one, these two.
[51:34.85]I think I got the hang of it by now.
[51:38.54]Just gonna do it fairly quickly.
[51:42.01]Okay.
[51:42.27]Remember when I ate that?
[51:45.02]Remember how funny that was?
[51:46.50]Alright, that's good.
[51:47.98]Last one.
[51:48.58]Fold the tab.
[51:49.34]Fold the tab.
[51:52.02]Tab.
[51:52.58]I bent it.
[51:59.29]Why?
[51:59.67]Don't be that angry.
[52:01.31]Of course I bent it, but I bent it a little too much.
[52:03.35]This is not a game for me.
[52:11.21]I'm fucking sweating down here.
[52:13.11]Sweaty Psycho makes children's toys on twitch.tv for all to see.
[52:19.03]Alright, this is good.
[52:20.77]We're good.
[52:22.07]Let's put it together.
[52:22.69]I did all this.
[52:28.30]All been folded, yep.
[52:29.46]It's ready to be put together.
[52:39.90]I did it.
[52:40.20]I already did that.
[52:44.16]Congrats, Jerma, you did it.
[52:45.80]I didn't do it yet.
[52:48.24]Slow down.
[52:49.82]Put it together.
[52:50.38]It should be easy if you made good tight folds.
[52:52.51]Yeah.
[52:53.59]So this comes up, in, up, in.
[53:02.85]So up, in, like that.
[53:06.90]And that one comes up, in.
[53:10.26]Wait, what about the tab there?
[53:12.52]The little tab has to be folded down like this.
[53:18.34]Fuck up.
[53:19.06]Alright.
[53:21.16]Get the tab in there.
[53:27.12]Just for you ASMR friends.
[53:28.40]It's gonna be nice and gentle.
[53:33.96]Ah!
[53:38.21]I'm sorry.
[53:40.33]I'm sorry.
[53:47.58]I belong back in fucking grade school, seriously.
[53:53.53]Firmly insert the tab.
[53:54.95]Do the same thing over here.
[53:55.83]Fold in the tabs.
[53:56.49]Be sure to fold the tabs the right order.
[53:57.87]Oh, right.
[53:58.35]What's the right order?
[53:59.99]This one first.
[54:07.50]And the second one, right?
[54:09.58]Yeah.
[54:09.70]So this one goes in after it.
[54:12.60]That feels a little tight in there, though.
[54:17.69]Fold this back and then I gotta punch these out.
[54:20.32]It's still in there.
[54:24.18]The holes, you idiot.
[54:26.14]You could have been more nice about it.
[54:27.14]You didn't have to call me names.
[54:29.30]Alright, so then that tab comes down just like the other one does.
[54:32.14]Stick it right in there.
[54:34.04]Right in there.
[54:37.98]How's it folded now?
[54:39.46]Okay.
[54:43.25]Flip it this way.
[54:45.15]Washer and dryer.
[54:47.73]Shorter of the two is the grommet.
[54:48.83]Yep, put the same thing.
[54:49.93]Just want to make sure I'm doing this right.
[54:53.65]Click click.
[54:54.89]Okay.
[55:02.84]This is neat though, isn't it?
[55:05.90]This is really neat.
[55:07.04]I think this is neat.
[55:09.48]I could imagine sitting around and having a couple of friends just getting shit-faced together.
[55:14.48]I'm just making one of these.
[55:17.46]Although it would get a little weird because only one person can really do this.
[55:21.50]There would be fights.
[55:22.40]Somebody would get punched in the face because they didn't get to make Mama Bear.
[55:30.65]That's in there.
[55:31.23]Snapped in.
[55:32.19]Not quite all the way.
[55:34.73]That looks good.
[55:35.91]Alright, let's go.
[55:38.93]Then the tab folds up.
[55:42.38]Put a fold on the tab and the tail in and it's ready to go.
[55:45.80]Mama Bear is complete.
[55:55.76]Now we're gonna do Papa Bear.
[55:59.68]Now join the baby bear you just made with Mama Bear.
[56:06.24]Hold on, I gotta... Okay.
[56:10.57]Join them together while the tab on the baby bear tail is folded.
[56:15.77]So, hold on, wait, go back.
[56:17.86]So they both have to be like this.
[56:20.82]Like that, right?
[56:23.38]So then this has to fold down and get inserted into the mother.
[56:29.82]So slide this in, slide baby bear all the way into mama bear.
[56:43.91]Like that.
[56:46.27]okay I'm trying to find the best angle to show you this alright so that's done are they nice and snug try sliding baby very in and out of the
[57:15.94]I don't want to see this anymore.
[57:18.64]I don't want that on my screen.
[57:20.42]I will lose my Twitch partnership.
[57:24.61]I'll lose everything.
[57:27.03]Alright.
[57:28.03]Slap it down there.
[57:28.95]It's done.
[57:30.23]What's next?
[57:31.53]Leave Mama Bear and Baby Bear and move on to our next part.
[57:34.33]Which is Dad.
[57:35.77]With the printed side face down, carefully crease each of the folds.
[57:38.77]Which one is this?
[57:39.31]It's this one.
[57:41.52]This has to come out.
[57:44.22]It's like
[57:46.48]shitty 2D breastplate so this now has to go here face down like that carefully crease each almost just took the whole camera system down carefully crease all the fold lines bring out the HDMI and the DVI ports okay let's just do that I know how to do it just yeah yeah yeah
[58:16.68]Okay, make sure that it's... Right side down, right?
[58:19.36]Right side down?
[58:21.16]Punch out the slots.
[58:26.43]I'll clean this up after.
[58:27.19]I'll vacuum it all up with my mouth.
[58:28.37]I'm just going to drag my mouth along the ground and just suck it as hard as I can.
[58:38.99]Come on.
[58:40.38]This little tab doesn't... It's not cut properly.
[58:43.12]Shit, I don't know how to bend it either.
[58:46.36]See what I mean?
[58:46.76]Look, it's not properly cut.
[58:49.33]They forgot to cut the bottom part.
[58:55.85]I might actually have to get the scissors for this one.
[58:59.05]Because I don't want to bend it too much.
[59:01.61]You didn't even cut it.
[59:02.35]You didn't even cut this shit.
[59:04.08]Look at this.
[59:05.68]Wait, does that come out?
[59:09.50]Does it?
[59:09.80]Yeah.
[59:20.19]don't matter okay it's not supposed to come up I'm fine I got we're fine I'm good calm down we're fine relax let's do some breathing exercises okay there's that one fold this one in crease hold this down and give it a crease
[59:50.66]Okay, there's all these.
[59:51.98]The ones on the sides do have to come out, though.
[59:53.76]I'm certain of that.
[59:54.46]Okay.
[60:01.59]So then all of them have to do with all of them.
[60:06.23]Some fishing rod this will turn out to be, huh?
[60:09.55]Then this part comes up.
[60:11.94]You just gotta do it all.
[60:14.18]Everywhere there's a line, just fold it up.
[60:15.80]Like that.
[60:23.90]Get batteries for the cup.
[60:28.80]I don't think I can.
[60:33.45]No, there's no batteries.
[60:34.69]I don't know how to even put batteries in here.
[60:36.87]Get batteries for the cup is what you care about right now?
[60:42.07]No, I can't even get in here.
[60:42.97]This is broken.
[60:45.83]Hand wash only.
[60:47.53]To activate flashing cup, press button at base.
[60:49.96]That's what I'm doing.
[60:50.60]It's just not working.
[60:53.29]This thing was free.
[60:58.99]Get some double A's.
[60:59.55]There's no double A's in a cup, guys.
[61:02.29]I'm working here.
[61:02.97]Hold on.
[61:03.15]Alright, fold that up like that.
[61:10.83]I feel like, should I like zoom this camera in to like here a little more or is this fine?
[61:16.07]Are you guys like alright with this whole setup?
[61:20.70]No.
[61:21.38]It's fine.
[61:21.98]It's alright.
[61:22.42]You can like see what the fuck I'm doing.
[61:25.46]Okay.
[61:26.76]Okay.
[61:27.62]Okay.
[61:27.84]That's fine.
[61:29.17]Alright.
[61:29.35]We got this folded.
[61:30.23]Nice and creased.
[61:32.71]Do it to this one.
[61:33.55]Do it to this one.
[61:34.33]This side.
[61:36.83]And it's got two.
[61:37.39]It's got a lot of little tabs.
[61:41.03]Alright.
[61:41.31]So who's going to win the $100 when I break something?
[61:44.79]When I accidentally rip a tab off?
[61:46.47]How long has the stream been?
[61:48.15]An hour?
[61:49.38]I'll give it like another hour and a half until something actually breaks.
[61:52.34]Alright, everything's folded.
[61:57.00]Let's see how it gets put together.
[62:02.90]A true fishing rod craftsperson folds the smaller tabs with extra care.
[62:09.34]Whatever.
[62:10.64]You don't have to tell me that.
[62:14.53]Alright, I did that.
[62:18.09]Let's go!
[62:20.52]Do a V-Bucks giveaway in the future?
[62:28.65]I've never played Fortnite.
[62:30.65]Why do you want a V-Bucks giveaway?
[62:38.75]Do people do that shit?
[62:40.85]What the fuck is a V-Buck?
[62:47.42]V-Bucks?
[62:51.51]Give me V-Bucks.
[62:53.17]Yeah, yeah, Battle Royale games.
[62:55.09]It's a Fortnite in-game currency.
[62:56.87]What do you buy with V-Bucks?
[62:57.94]Oh, you buy skins.
[62:58.88]Oh yeah, you can buy Keanu Reeves, right?
[63:01.66]It's like 40,000 V-Bucks.
[63:08.22]Stop talking about Fortnite.
[63:09.60]I don't even play that game.
[63:11.46]We're doing Nintendo Labo right now.
[63:15.22]Now you got me all fucked up, because I started talking about Fortnite.
[63:19.14]Fold the whole part over to make a box.
[63:22.34]I can do this one at a time here.
[63:23.86]So like this.
[63:29.84]Zoom in, zoom in.
[63:32.10]Careful not to bend the small tabs that clicks on.
[63:35.72]Like this.
[63:42.95]Get the ASMR people in here.
[63:46.21]I'm going to scream again.
[63:47.65]I want to make sure you're aware of it.
[63:48.73]I'm going to scream as loud as I can in like five seconds.
[64:01.02]That was a good one.
[64:01.86]Alright, what's next?
[64:09.10]Spin it around like that.
[64:12.17]This comes up.
[64:14.65]No, go back.
[64:15.13]I didn't even see how that worked.
[64:16.37]So just from here, this goes up like this.
[64:23.26]That.
[64:25.70]Get this tab in, stick it in there so you got a little biplane, a little thing.
[64:31.14]Alright, let's get one more ASMR for you guys.
[64:47.64]There it is.
[64:51.16]Tab in the middle, then these ones flow.
[64:52.47]Now insert the tabs on the left and on the right to finish up your box.
[65:00.88]you know there's probably somebody that's made at least forty to fifty thousand dollars building labos silently with a binaural microphone oh yeah let somebody find it there's definitely somebody making like little like of course there is that person made four hundred thousand dollars on those videos it's me
[65:30.00]It's not me.
[65:32.68]I'm just... It is me.
[65:35.70]I didn't make $400,000 though.
[65:40.95]Just wait till my fucking ASMR video or stream.
[65:45.63]Just wait.
[65:47.07]Wait, wait, wait.
[65:47.47]Hold on.
[65:53.13]You see the tracks go this way.
[65:55.98]And you see this is a very... Oh, shit.
[65:59.73]I actually did break it, didn't I?
[66:07.63]At least one person got that.
[66:08.64]That's all I care about.
[66:09.28]Alright, this is done.
[66:11.10]This piece here is Mama Bear and Papa Bear.
[66:13.00]Alright.
[66:17.96]Yeah.
[66:19.64]Did that already.
[66:20.24]This probably goes in the middle.
[66:24.56]Next, build the biggest part, which we'll call Papa Bear.
[66:26.28]So let's get these out of the way.
[66:33.31]flip it around this is the biggest one so get these almost more than halfway down here and then we're gonna play our funny intent what is this alright so the center has to come out of there Papa bear has some long fold lines so be sure to crease them neatly doing this right will make the later steps easier
[67:30.01]Just like that.
[67:30.45]Just get a little elbow grease on there and buff it up.
[67:36.60]Okay, we're good.
[67:40.42]As hard as a rock.
[67:46.30]I can't eat this now.
[67:48.68]Don't eat that!
[67:52.42]Okay, Papa Bear has some big creases.
[67:55.52]That wasn't necessary.
[67:56.38]Get it out of here.
[67:57.32]Fuck it.
[67:57.88]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[68:06.12]So Papa Bear has some fold lines that are really big.
[68:09.65]Do it neatly.
[68:10.41]Oh fuck, it's already, it went through the other side, whatever.
[68:15.45]So very neatly, very precisely, all these fold lines.
[68:19.45]You got it, here we go.
[68:28.15]Ooh, this is tight.
[68:31.12]This is really tight.
[68:33.54]Papa Bear is very, very tight.
[68:37.42]His cardboard is very, very tight to do this with.
[68:42.34]That's not easy.
[68:47.16]This is not going down.
[68:48.20]Hold on.
[68:51.56]There it is.
[68:58.24]Okay, got it.
[69:02.28]Do them all.
[69:09.98]I'm so desperately trying to get you involved.
[69:12.50]You know what I'm saying?
[69:13.03]I'm trying to get you involved here.
[69:33.17]Those pecs.
[69:36.85]That was an embarrassing face.
[69:39.03]I need to
[69:42.06]Don't look at me for a second.
[70:00.73]We're back.
[70:02.03]It didn't fucking do anything.
[70:02.87]I tried to get the sweat off my face.
[70:07.50]Stupid fucking thing.
[70:08.34]Alright.
[70:11.19]There are a lot of folds.
[70:12.05]Just got to get them all.
[70:12.75]Just don't even need the tutorial.
[70:14.81]What is that?
[70:15.45]Pizza?
[70:15.65]This is going to be the hardest one.
[70:31.57]I can feel that one.
[70:32.31]This one is giving resistance.
[70:33.75]Good thing I do all that fucking training with my hands.
[70:35.55]You know the machine where you go like this?
[70:36.80]You just grab the machine.
[70:38.71]It's like the two handlebars and you just go like this over and fucking over again.
[70:41.97]I used to only sit at that machine.
[70:54.68]Okay.
[70:56.38]So far so good.
[70:57.82]Sorry I'm taking so much time doing this one.
[71:00.47]These actually are very hard to do.
[71:01.97]They're super hard and hard and...
[71:07.01]precise.
[71:07.47]Look at this little spot right here.
[71:08.75]This part in particular is the worst.
[71:11.26]This little tiny little edge here.
[71:14.72]I can't fuck this up.
[71:33.41]Sorry, somebody sped up the video.
[71:35.53]Don't fucking hit the fast forward again.
[71:37.05]You're going to screw me up.
[71:46.03]Okay.
[71:47.86]That's it for these major ones.
[71:49.70]Right, one more here.
[72:01.46]You'll find what?
[72:04.39]What are those grease stains on your cardboard?
[72:06.37]It's just the way that my hands are.
[72:07.95]I have a condition where just sometimes when it gets hot, grease, like actual fucking pizza grease comes out of my hands.
[72:18.45]It's really embarrassing to shake people's hands because it smells like pizza grease too, so I don't know if it's weird.
[72:24.23]Alright, done.
[72:33.42]Donezo.
[72:34.88]Completed.
[72:35.42]Got that one.
[72:45.31]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[72:51.55]Don't forget the little ones.
[72:54.75]They're ripe, don't forget them.
[72:59.41]Almost forgot the little ones.
[73:00.97]And I gotta pop out all these little shits, don't I?
[73:02.65]Yeah, I do.
[73:14.22]Okay.
[73:20.54]Any more little tabs?
[73:21.26]Is that it?
[73:21.82]No, right over here.
[73:24.22]You know, I'll tell you, it is very satisfying to just pop out the little stuff.
[73:29.14]Folding things.
[73:29.68]It's a satisfying experience.
[73:32.30]Is it a $70 experience?
[73:32.90]No.
[73:49.11]Cool.
[73:56.57]But no.
[73:56.83]$444.
[73:57.05]Yeah, well, that's what I paid for it.
[73:59.59]I had to get it rushed delivered.
[74:00.65]Alright.
[74:04.38]Yeah, that's unfair.
[74:05.10]I mean, how many hours of content are in one box?
[74:08.66]500?
[74:10.68]Well, it depends on how slow you are at building stuff.
[74:14.58]I'd say like 4,000 to 4,500.
[74:23.33]Yeah.
[74:24.29]Alright, let's do it.
[74:31.47]Now let's put together the box we just made.
[74:32.89]Use the small tabs.
[74:33.57]Hold it in one place.
[74:35.73]Tab goes up.
[74:41.13]Oh, shit.
[74:41.99]Hold on.
[74:42.45]Wait.
[74:46.46]New piece coming in.
[74:47.42]We had this earlier.
[74:48.84]This comes in.
[74:51.36]And then it comes...
[74:53.74]Let's put together the boxes and use the small tabs to hold it all in one place.
[74:57.96]Give me a better view of this.
[75:02.93]Okay, so that comes down like this.
[75:04.87]Let me do it just like the video so I can see it.
[75:27.02]Flatten out.
[75:27.72]Flatten the fuck out.
[75:30.96]Just put the little nub up there.
[75:39.21]Okay, that's it.
[75:45.47]Okay.
[75:45.73]Now what do you want me to do?
[75:50.97]Click.
[75:53.36]Curl it along the folds you made.
[75:55.08]Make sure you creased all the fold lines, okay?
[75:57.96]So this part comes up and around.
[76:02.16]So this part comes up.
[76:05.98]And then this, there's something in here.
[76:07.98]Okay, whatever it is, it's gone now.
[76:23.94]gonna fly up here that's in there this folds up like this like that and then keeps going around right so up over over again so then this has to go like this so the whole thing comes down like that
[76:52.75]And this comes up, the tabs come down into the tab holders like this.
[76:57.21]Okay.
[77:11.57]Fold the tabs on the end in, make sure to get them the right order so it's the top one.
[77:16.99]Top one goes, this one goes in first.
[77:20.22]And then the same deal with this, like the other ones, it sticks right down the side.
[77:22.90]Get down there, fuck you.
[77:26.38]Like that.
[77:33.89]Just wait for the spaghetti.
[77:37.75]Okay, that looks good.
[77:38.85]Did I do that right?
[77:39.39]Yeah.
[77:39.53]Yeah, I got it, okay.
[77:47.35]Turn it this way, and then more washers.
[77:53.12]These things don't feel like they're on there that well.
[77:54.70]Okay.
[77:55.88]Grab two more Robinson washers out of here.
[77:57.76]We're almost done.
[78:06.84]Actually, no, we're not.
[78:07.52]Not even close.
[78:11.04]I lost a piece.
[78:12.06]Fuck.
[78:12.44]No, no, no.
[78:12.84]Why is this one a different color?
[78:18.19]Oh, there we go.
[78:18.77]I was going to say, why is this one not blue?
[78:23.74]Okay, that's good.
[78:25.80]Spaghetti will be for the wine, I assume, eventually here.
[78:28.44]So, same thing, right?
[78:29.24]You just put them together.
[78:31.92]Spider, where?
[78:32.66]What are you talking about?
[78:41.55]On your shoulder.
[78:44.39]He's dead.
[78:47.91]Same deal.
[78:48.51]This goes through.
[78:49.23]Oh, you got me.
[78:49.89]Okay, cool.
[78:50.49]You got me.
[78:53.10]Jump the spider.
[78:53.62]This washer goes on.
[79:02.66]Nice little snap.
[79:05.29]Ah, it didn't go on there right.
[79:06.55]I need an adult in here.
[79:07.69]I need an adult to go in there.
[79:09.19]That's on there.
[79:17.89]Papa Bear is done.
[79:18.81]So we have...
[79:20.28]now for the much smaller little box lay the piece out printed side down it's gonna annoy the out of me it really is now for a much smaller printed side down like this right okay it's easier if you crease the small parts as well so crease everything just do everything you have to crease crease crease it's all about the creasing
[79:50.17]Crease every single piece.
[79:53.75]Can't wait to play the shitty iPad fishing game with our terrible motion-controlled cardboard fishing rod.
[80:02.95]Can't wait.
[80:03.85]It's going to be fucking fun.
[80:05.57]What a blast this is going to be.
[80:08.59]You know what?
[80:09.15]Shut up, Jeremy.
[80:09.79]This is going to be fun.
[80:12.07]I'm looking forward to this.
[80:12.73]This is going to be pretty fun.
[80:16.79]You think I'm not okay with this?
[80:18.39]I'm very much okay with this.
[80:20.75]This is very cool.
[80:21.81]What an interesting concept.
[80:28.72]Looks good.
[80:29.28]Alright.
[80:34.56]Ooh, that one's weird.
[80:35.62]I think I fucked it up.
[80:40.60]No, we're okay.
[80:42.89]Does he have a booster seat?
[80:43.85]You tell me.
[80:44.21]Why don't you look?
[80:45.33]Why don't you look?
[80:48.25]Look at that.
[80:48.83]What's on the seat?
[80:49.43]Nothing.
[80:50.37]It's a chair.
[80:58.96]Whoops.
[80:59.18]There we go.
[81:08.99]Okay.
[81:09.21]I haven't folded all.
[81:12.41]It's all folded.
[81:12.93]I got every tab done.
[81:13.89]It's alright.
[81:19.02]I already did it.
[81:19.72]Please move on.
[81:20.38]I feel like I'm rolling a cigarette.
[81:29.81]I can't stop talking about cigarettes.
[81:34.87]That's just what's happening tonight for some reason.
[81:36.49]Alright, roll it up and insert the tab.
[81:38.63]So just roll it up.
[81:41.11]Like this.
[81:42.05]That comes in.
[81:43.92]Up.
[81:46.32]Like that.
[81:48.08]This goes inside of here, right?
[81:50.26]Yes.
[81:52.45]Let's get the brightness turned up a little bit more.
[81:53.99]It is getting dark.
[81:54.61]There we go, right?
[82:16.11]It's getting dark in here.
[82:17.47]I need to turn it up.
[82:20.21]I look like a young Tom Howard.
[82:29.82]This one.
[82:30.18]Hold on.
[82:30.38]Is that too much exposure?
[82:35.21]Yeah.
[82:35.69]Hold on.
[82:35.87]I'll turn it down.
[82:48.92]Okay, there we go.
[82:49.94]That should do it.
[82:51.38]Yeah, that's better.
[82:52.72]Although this one looks like shit.
[82:54.42]Hold on.
[82:54.82]Wait, I gotta change this one now too.
[83:05.58]That's too much.
[83:13.27]There.
[83:14.69]Look, it just looks like two different TV shows going on at the same time.
[83:17.17]You'll figure it out.
[83:19.53]You'll be alright.
[83:20.38]Alright, so that's like this.
[83:26.48]Tab went in.
[83:28.44]Snapped it up.
[83:30.22]Flip this around.
[83:31.14]Whoa, no, wait, wait, wait.
[83:31.90]I gotta put this inside of the business.
[83:33.78]Now slide the box onto Papa Bear.
[83:36.69]Check your work carefully.
[83:37.67]It's easy to get it backwards.
[83:38.71]Okay, where's Papa Bear?
[83:41.13]Right here?
[83:44.73]So then this goes like this.
[83:50.66]that, right?
[83:53.00]Is it all the way on the edge?
[83:54.90]Yeah.
[83:58.14]Gotta line up the holes, okay.
[84:01.25]What holes?
[84:05.01]Oh, fuck.
[84:05.59]Alright, we're good.
[84:23.75]Okay.
[84:25.37]Got it.
[84:26.63]Like that.
[84:28.21]Let's get a good view of this so you guys at home can be like, nice dude.
[84:32.71]Right in the end.
[84:50.99]Nice dude.
[84:51.65]Thanks man.
[84:52.75]I really appreciate it.
[84:54.55]Alright, let's go.
[84:56.09]Insert the last tab.
[84:57.49]The parts are joined.
[84:58.45]Alright, so this now has to come up down like this and around and in.
[85:01.09]That's in.
[85:08.35]Okay.
[85:10.23]Pretty cool.
[85:11.21]Works pretty well, I think.
[85:12.39]Alright, next one.
[85:14.47]So then now, here comes the other part of the fishing rod.
[85:16.82]This goes like this.
[85:19.78]In.
[85:20.32]It's gonna slide in here.
[85:22.32]Join them together with the mama bear tab folded.
[85:26.60]This is to be folded up.
[85:29.00]And you get three slots there.
[85:30.20]Like this.
[85:34.53]Right?
[85:35.11]And it goes in.
[85:43.25]I'm alright.
[85:44.03]I'm happy.
[85:44.48]This is happy.
[85:45.08]Okay.
[85:46.54]Good English.
[85:47.44]Here we go.
[85:48.62]Let's test our work by sliding Mama Bear and Baby Bear in and out of Papa Bear.
[85:52.66]Okay.
[85:53.40]Why don't we try that?
[86:04.60]Bingo.
[86:05.22]Works pretty well.
[86:07.16]Alright, we got it.
[86:10.72]It looks good.
[86:11.14]It looks alright.
[86:14.24]Okay, forward.
[86:17.01]Almost done with this step.
[86:18.03]Now you'll make the holder for the Joy-Con.
[86:21.87]Which is this thing right here.
[86:23.17]Hold on a second.
[86:28.75]It fucking stinks like pizza in here.
[86:31.83]Do I have a sweaty... Never mind.
[87:13.35]I pissed in a bottle and now I'm going to drink it.
[87:18.92]Can I say that on Twitch without getting yelled at by somebody that's a staff member?
[87:22.58]Alright, be careful.
[87:23.96]Be extra careful here.
[87:26.70]Crease along the two-fold lines.
[87:28.61]Don't screw it up.
[87:29.39]This is your only chance.
[87:30.43]Like this.
[87:32.89]Pop these up.
[87:36.73]Is the staff member in chat right now?
[87:40.10]No, it's not.
[87:42.90]Nobody watches this stream.
[87:45.46]How many people are here?
[87:52.12]Oh shit, people are watching this stream.
[87:55.40]38.
[87:55.58]100.
[87:58.54]Dev in the chat, spill joke.
[88:00.24]Oh no!
[88:01.92]Oh shit, look out!
[88:02.98]I'm not gonna, I told you I'm not gonna do that.
[88:05.78]That's not, this is, I'm actually just enjoying a Coca-Cola classic.
[88:11.08]What's up, man?
[88:14.13]Baby medicine.
[88:14.95]Not baby medicine.
[88:15.59]Old person.
[88:16.07]What's it?
[88:16.47]Grandpa's medicine?
[88:18.19]You know the dumb joke that people make.
[88:19.91]Well, I just tried to make it.
[88:20.81]Anyways, let's go.
[88:21.33]Come on.
[88:22.81]Let's fold these creases.
[88:24.15]Be extra careful.
[88:24.91]These things are very delicate.
[88:31.82]What if I just fucking tore this in half?
[88:36.20]Don't put it past me.
[88:37.02]Seriously.
[88:39.40]Nobody laugh at that because I'll do it.
[88:42.09]I'm such a peer pressure weirdo.
[88:43.45]I'll be like, oh, you think it's funny?
[88:48.20]Did I do good?
[88:48.88]Do you think it's funny?
[88:49.80]Are you laughing?
[88:50.82]Yeah, I got to be careful.
[88:56.34]Extra careful means don't do it.
[88:58.50]Do it on the table where you should be doing it in the first place.
[89:04.18]So what about the base?
[89:05.71]I guess there's so much more work to do.
[89:10.32]This is not as simple as, oh no, now we're done.
[89:13.48]This is like fucking another two hours of work here.
[89:17.23]There's at least an hour left to do.
[89:18.85]This is really gonna test my ADHD, it really is.
[89:23.29]Ah, did I get to like the rod?
[89:27.83]Nah, I'm fucking done.
[89:29.23]No, I gotta finish it.
[89:30.35]Finish at least three of them.
[89:31.49]No, let's just say two.
[89:32.47]We're gonna do this again, by the way, guys.
[89:37.63]You think this is the only Labo stream?
[89:40.33]I'll put you to sleep on fucking Wednesday night.
[89:48.01]Everyone has ADHD these days?
[89:49.45]I'm diagnosed ADHD.
[89:51.55]I got OG diagnosed ADHD back in like 1991.
[89:54.44]So, come on.
[90:04.82]Is he a Redditor?
[90:05.60]What?
[90:06.00]What the fuck does that mean?
[90:09.74]You have Redditor?
[90:10.42]Did I read that correctly?
[90:15.15]I don't think I've read that correctly.
[90:17.81]Oh, look out!
[90:18.29]He's gonna spill it!
[90:31.45]What am I doing?
[90:31.87]Go!
[90:32.07]What am I doing?
[90:32.45]I'm staring at the camera.
[90:33.47]Alright, let's see where this one goes.
[90:40.12]yeah I got them all folded little nuanced ones yeah looks good leave the tabs standing up and then flip it around slide the whole thing into papa bear what are you talking about hold on leave all the tabs standing up with just these ones so just these have to be frayed out so like that this whole thing goes into papa bear
[91:08.60]And then lines up with this here.
[91:12.46]Like this.
[91:18.78]Like that.
[91:21.16]Okay.
[91:23.64]Turn it over and slide these two big tabs right into the openings.
[91:28.16]Comes all the way down, so like this.
[91:33.11]This comes up.
[91:35.27]Oh, Jesus, okay.
[91:41.24]Like that.
[91:41.70]And these go down and around in here.
[91:47.30]Snap it in.
[91:47.82]Okay.
[91:55.87]Looks pretty good.
[91:58.81]I see in two hours when we finish the base.
[92:02.24]Alright.
[92:05.74]Does that look right to you?
[92:07.30]Does that look right to you?
[92:15.49]That look right, dad?
[92:16.57]How's that look, dad?
[92:20.65]The rod is finished.
[92:23.97]Now what?
[92:26.03]Go to work, if you need a break, I'll totally understand.
[92:29.30]We don't get breaks here.
[92:31.94]Step two out of five.
[92:37.88]We're gonna be here for a while.
[92:44.45]Look at how elaborate that is.
[92:46.72]Shit, remove these five parts from A and B. Alright, you've seen it.
[92:51.12]You know what it looks like.
[92:52.46]It's going over here.
[92:55.68]Right into the fucking liquid, great.

[95:22.07]You sit in 115 degree weather.
[95:24.13]With your fucking window open.
[95:25.23]That's it.
[95:25.57]Alright.
[95:29.93]I think that's all for A and B. A and B are done completely, right?
[95:33.77]That's what it looks like.
[95:35.80]No other pieces, right?

[96:10.80]What did I do that was pre-recorded?
[96:12.04]Oh, video, because I said the word video.
[96:19.49]I don't need the blue Joy-Con.
[96:20.69]It can kind of get out of my way.
[96:23.63]There we go.
[96:24.25]Okay.
[96:25.75]Let's set this.
[96:27.11]Get the spaghetti out of the way.

[97:06.39]10 parts.
[97:06.71]From C and D. How could a little kid do this?
[97:12.10]They'll lose every single one of these fucking things.
[97:14.14]Okay.
[97:15.84]C is this one.
[97:16.74]All of them have to come out except for this one.
[97:18.18]This one's not coming out.
[97:21.45]So the two race cars down here, car engine, and I don't know which way you're going, dude.
[97:29.43]Or hazard symbol, hazard signs.
[97:30.77]Okay, that's fine.
[97:31.69]Pop it out.
[97:41.05]One.
[97:43.86]This is a Joy-Con holder.
[97:51.88]Two.
[97:53.12]Balls on spring.
[97:55.02]Where?
[98:13.13]I told you I had a nightmare one time, right?
[98:17.57]Where I was just barely the webcam.
[98:19.67]I didn't have pants or underwear on, right?
[98:21.42]I told this story, I think.
[98:23.64]I had a dream, for those of you that didn't hear about it, that I had a webcam on that was right up to here, exactly where this is.
[98:32.03]This is my nightmare scenario.
[98:34.39]And during the dream, I had, I knew I was naked.
[98:37.77]I had just nothing below, right?
[98:40.33]So I'm playing a game and I'm sitting there going to myself, alright, as long as I just remember that I'm naked down here, just don't move and I could go over the footage later and make sure nothing happened, right?
[98:50.02]So at some point during the stream, I did one of these.
[98:53.66]Just barely up right here, right?
[98:57.32]And I remember having like a, whoa, fuck, panic.
[99:00.13]And I sat back down.
[99:01.74]And I was like, fuck, my dick and balls, fuck.
[99:04.39]And I went back to playing the game and I was like, oh yeah, so we're just doing this.
[99:06.63]I looked over at chat and didn't see anything.
[99:09.31]Didn't see anything at all.
[99:10.29]Nobody mentioned, nobody said like, nobody said balls, balls, right?
[99:12.77]So I was like, okay, so I think I'm going to be up there.
[99:14.28]Nobody saw that, right?
[99:14.90]It was just right at the layer below the webcam.
[99:17.59]And then after the stream ended, I went through the footage.
[99:21.71]And I slowly went through right where I... Because you know, you go and you do like a fucking panic freakout.
[99:26.41]Well, you're like a top 1,000 streamer.
[99:27.99]Sometimes you have a panic.
[99:28.77]And you want to make sure you didn't look stupid or say something stupid.
[99:32.36]So it got to the point right where it came over when I leaned up.
[99:37.00]And there you could see my penis.
[99:40.99]And I just was like, I have to delete the VOD.
[99:42.73]Fuck, it's right there.
[99:43.74]You can see it.
[99:45.00]And I deleted the VOD.
[99:46.30]And I was just praying in my dream that no one happened to fucking see it.
[99:50.38]And no one happened to get to that part in the VOD yet.
[99:53.30]And then I woke up and I thought it was real.
[99:55.40]And I was like, well, you know, you got to own it, right?
[99:58.02]That was what I was thinking right when I woke up.
[100:01.10]And then I found out it wasn't real.
[100:09.74]I can't do those jokes.
[100:12.68]It was real.
[100:14.40]Oh, it wasn't.
[100:16.36]Don't throw this one, because I need this piece, brother.
[100:21.13]Oh, what am I doing, you fucking idiot?
[100:24.53]These are bending.
[100:25.53]Stupid idiot.
[100:26.75]Fucking dumb.
[100:27.63]We're not going to make any of those.
[100:31.80]They're going like this around the box.
[100:34.44]I see D. Where's D?
[100:37.82]A, B, C, D.
[100:43.27]There's all kinds of gears in here.
[100:44.45]I gotta separate these.
[100:46.03]I need to make a workstation.
[100:47.43]I'm trying to do a 4,000 piece jigsaw puzzle on a lunch tray.
[100:54.42]What am I doing?
[101:10.76]Get these, whatever.
[101:12.28]They're all coming out.
[101:13.06]All of them are coming out.
[101:13.81]Every single piece.
[101:14.53]Get it out.
[101:19.97]Every single one of these has to come out.
[101:22.75]This one's so much more.
[101:27.58]Slow down.
[101:28.20]Don't fucking break it because you're being a psycho.
[101:31.32]Just relax.
[101:38.86]Look at how little these are.
[101:39.72]These little tabs are so bendable and so easy to break.
[101:44.33]I'm going to lose a piece and you're going to hear me scream about it.
[101:49.95]This is essentially an unboxing video, right?
[101:53.87]Everybody loves this shit.
[101:54.85]They love hearing that sound.
[101:55.83]They love smelling it.
[101:56.49]They love looking at it.
[101:57.81]I need to be quiet.
[101:59.07]Shut up.
[101:59.77]No, not you.
[102:00.25]Me.
[102:20.68]reaching there okay that's all of them right every piece okay hold on let me make sure I look good not really alright let's go forward almost two hours what was the estimated time 90 minutes
[102:46.05]But I've been telling stories though, right?
[102:48.79]I've been like telling stories.
[102:51.03]I've been stopping like I'm doing right now and telling stories.
[102:57.89]Here's a pro tip.
[102:58.55]You can fast forward the video by stretching the forward button to the right with your finger.
[103:06.60]What are you talking about?
[103:12.08]Oh, hold down ZR
[103:16.38]Ah, that's a good thing.
[103:17.80]Okay, start with the printed side face down.
[103:22.00]Which piece is this?
[103:24.36]This one.
[103:25.54]Okay, get out of the way.
[103:28.33]Spider, I lost a piece.
[103:29.73]I lost a piece.
[103:30.51]Man down.
[103:32.41]Man down.
[103:37.20]Man down, hold on.
[103:43.74]Oh man, what a fail, right?
[103:47.18]Get me on that front page.
[103:48.61]Don't do it.
[103:54.49]See, the thing is, I tried to fake that, and you can hear two sounds there specifically.
[103:59.57]One of them, I actually bumped my head.
[104:02.76]Did you see this guy fucked up?
[104:12.37]Alright, what am I doing?
[104:13.19]Does that take these out?
[104:22.57]I have to take these out, right?
[104:26.55]Epic fail.
[104:27.24]No, I'm just fucking kidding, by the way.
[104:28.56]Don't be a dick.
[104:36.22]I think I don't have to explain what I mean by that.
[104:39.38]My webcam broke.
[104:47.95]How long is the clip?
[104:49.93]That wasn't fucking real.
[104:51.70]I don't condone somebody pretending that was real.
[104:57.02]What am I talking about?
[104:58.20]What am I saying?
[105:00.02]What am I doing?
[105:09.69]Whatever.
[105:11.39]I don't want to get shit for that.
[105:25.08]Okay, here we are.
[105:27.05]I'm losing it.
[105:27.67]No, because I'm thinking about, like, don't brigade a subreddit, like, as a joke.
[105:30.37]Don't do it.
[105:32.27]Please don't do that in my name.
[105:34.41]We made it like a little joke.
[105:35.45]Don't do that shit.
[105:38.51]That's all I gotta say.
[105:39.79]That's all I gotta say.
[105:50.64]Flip a piece or it's pre-recorded.
[105:51.88]There you go.
[105:54.74]And I caught it too.
[105:56.64]Caught it again.
[106:00.18]Somebody else can do that.
[106:01.14]That's not me.
[106:02.08]Find them.
[106:02.42]How about this one?
[106:06.14]Let's flip this too.
[106:09.78]Alright.
[106:10.64]Pay attention.
[106:14.77]This start with printed side face down.

[106:38.60]You guys trying to get me fired?
[106:48.95]Yes.
[106:51.04]Why are you trying to get me fired?
[106:54.48]This piece came out.
[106:56.76]Was that supposed to happen?
[106:58.94]Yeah, OK, we're good.
[107:03.93]There's little indents here.
[107:06.21]I'm not sure what they're for.
[107:07.15]See what I'm talking about?
[107:09.39]See the indents here?
[107:11.29]Little X's, little crosses.
[107:13.03]Let's fold these up.

[109:44.87]I don't want to do the streamer.
[109:46.13]I don't do anything.
[109:46.65]I don't want to sit around.
[109:47.63]I want to be able to do these things.
[109:54.64]I want to be able to finish my fishing rod in another two hours.
[110:03.10]This one piece took 25 minutes.
[110:15.21]Just fold it, please.
[110:16.24]And don't punch anybody.
[110:23.32]Do a Roblox speedrun.
[110:24.88]No, we're doing Nintendo Labo.
[110:27.90]You understand?
[110:28.44]This is the pinnacle of my Twitch career.
[110:35.25]Or I do a children's construction set.
[110:41.83]Okay.
[110:42.13]Alright, we're good.
[110:44.05]Everything's folded.
[110:44.68]Everything's ready to go.
[110:45.32]Let's do it.
[110:45.98]Nintendo what?
[110:50.80]Nintendo Labo?
[110:52.90]Is it supposed to be something else?
[110:55.46]It's not Labo.
[110:56.38]What is it?
[110:56.76]Labo?
[110:58.88]The big Nintendo Lebowski?
[111:03.12]I missed all that.
[111:03.74]Hold on.
[111:04.02]Alright, so these come up.
[111:08.24]It's like a lobster tail.
[111:10.86]Don't minus to me on that one.
[111:12.10]That was a well thought out reference.
[111:13.74]Alright, so this comes up.
[111:15.58]So these have to stay up like this.
[111:17.76]Like a big lobster tail.
[111:20.36]Like that.
[111:22.25]And then this folds in on itself.
[111:25.90]This is the wrong way, by the way.
[111:27.26]Flip it around, dummy.
[111:29.14]So then up.
[111:35.40]Then this comes up like this.
[111:38.73]This is going to connect here.
[111:44.61]Which piece goes into where?
[111:45.57]That opens up.
[111:46.43]Insert the tabs into the slot, starting with the biggest one.
[111:49.30]Push this in.
[111:51.51]So like this.
[111:56.31]You don't need to see this.
[111:57.11]Why do I care about this?
[111:57.99]Okay, that's in.
[112:03.89]And then this one folds in and goes in as well.
[112:06.69]Okay, cool.
[112:10.26]Nice, dude.
[112:11.36]Nice, man.
[112:11.98]You did it.
[112:12.36]Nice work.
[112:16.72]Nice.
[112:17.14]Okay.
[112:18.14]Nice, dude.
[112:18.72]Thanks, man.
[112:19.22]Appreciate it.
[112:20.14]I worked real hard here, you know?
[112:23.22]Thank you so much.
[112:24.34]I really appreciate that.
[112:25.30]I pushed a tab in and made a cardboard.
[112:31.23]Worked real hard to do that.
[112:33.51]Thank you.
[112:36.15]Thank you so much.
[112:36.71]Alright, now what?
[112:40.31]Okay, these other things, these little discs to come out here.
[112:44.02]Put your balls in it.
[112:44.72]Oh, it's gone.
[112:51.23]This circle's going to come up.
[112:52.51]Get that out of there.
[112:56.01]Tabs come up.
[112:57.99]Both sides are going to have to do this too.
[112:59.31]That's fine.
[113:02.00]He was.
[113:02.58]That's correct, right?
[113:08.58]Find the three tabs.
[113:11.20]And this goes in swole.
[113:14.45]You're blowing my mind here.
[113:15.47]Hold on.
[113:15.79]So it's going to go like this.
[113:18.22]Here's the corner.
[113:19.26]Does it matter which way?
[113:20.02]Where's the Labo logo?
[113:20.94]Do I can get this completely exactly the way they want it?
[113:23.26]Like this?
[113:25.44]So it's got to go like this.
[113:27.26]This tab goes in here.
[113:30.46]This tab goes in here.
[113:31.72]And this one goes in here.
[113:34.23]I can't do it.
[113:34.73]I quit.
[113:36.23]Let's go play Fortnite.
[113:42.71]Like that.
[113:48.26]That's good.
[113:52.50]Jimmer becomes a Fortnite streamer.
[113:55.74]No.
[113:57.18]Same thing on the other side, for sure, right?
[113:59.92]Yeah, same thing.
[114:01.60]Tab, tab, tab, tab, tab.
[114:04.24]Stick it in the slot.
[114:10.16]Okay, I'm not doing that anymore, because as we keep playing, there's gonna be tons of little pieces of shit all over the, cardboard slices all over the ground.
[114:18.40]I don't want to clean that all up.
[114:19.48]I'm going to make a trash pile now.
[114:21.98]That was funny the first four times.
[114:25.12]Not like time number 17.
[114:27.10]So I'm not going to do that anymore.
[114:28.24]Okay, let's get there.
[114:32.25]Do a dab.
[114:34.11]No.
[114:35.43]There was a bug on there, I think.
[114:36.37]Okay.
[114:45.59]Nobody said that.
[114:46.27]What do you mean nobody said that?
[114:49.12]Just go back in the chat, like fucking 30 people just wrote that.
[114:53.01]I don't have to prove that somebody wrote that?
[114:58.15]Nobody said that except for the last like 100 responses.

[115:50.32]Pass the rod through the hole.
[115:51.48]If it gets stuck, take a look inside the reel.
[115:53.20]Okay, so this just goes like this.
[115:59.58]Right?
[116:00.58]Like that.
[116:02.06]Yeah.
[116:02.96]So these have to come out.
[116:08.23]Fold them back.
[116:10.65]This goes in here like this.
[116:15.87]All the way through into... Wait, hold on.
[116:17.67]Into here because there's the two slots there.
[116:20.13]Right at the end, you see them?
[116:22.17]So this goes in.
[116:42.98]It's stuck.
[116:58.95]Do it hard.
[117:03.45]Easy?
[117:03.89]Okay.
[117:07.21]Need lube.
[117:12.64]No, don't do it.
[117:13.66]It's too early for that.
[117:16.86]It's too early for that, for real.
[117:19.38]Maybe like another two times.
[117:20.46]These go in.
[117:24.24]Tabs go in, right?
[117:29.34]Let's get a little bit more to the right.
[117:32.16]Tab one.
[117:32.78]Tab two.
[117:38.90]What do I mean?
[117:39.30]It's too early for that?
[117:41.76]No, no, no, no, no.
[117:42.32]I'm talking about like putting it all over this.
[117:44.30]Like that would be a funny joke and then I would ruin everything.
[117:46.62]And wow, that was funny.
[117:47.46]Now I can't play it anymore.
[117:49.70]I've been making this for almost an hour and 30 minutes.
[117:52.38]I'm not going to fuck it up now.
[117:57.64]Okay.
[117:58.56]We'll make the center of the reel.
[117:59.69]It's the part that will hold the left Joy-Con.
[118:04.39]Where is it in this bunch of trash?
[118:10.39]Get out of the way for now.
[118:11.47]You've seen it.
[118:13.25]You've seen my snail.
[118:16.36]You don't need to see it again.
[118:18.58]It's this piece.
[118:20.32]Like that.
[118:21.30]Do I have it the wrong way?
[118:23.18]I do.
[118:23.86]Now it's the right way.
[118:25.34]Right there.
[118:27.86]Come on.
[118:28.95]Punch out all the little nodes.
[118:30.57]Remember, trash pile.
[118:32.59]Don't throw them behind you.
[118:33.73]No one thinks that's funny anymore.
[118:37.33]Does one guy think it's funny?
[118:45.94]Somebody said yes.
[118:59.30]Hold on, I gotta get the little pieces out.
[119:02.10]All of them, right?
[119:04.24]Classic!
[119:06.56]You know, I try.
[119:09.96]Wait, wait, wait!
[119:10.66]Where else are you gonna get a guy that's gonna pop out a little bit of cardboard and throw it behind him, huh?
[119:14.16]Who else is gonna do that?
[119:16.48]Only on this channel where you get that kind of quality fucking content.
[119:20.54]See, watch him, he's gonna do it again.
[119:21.64]Hey, get the clip ready, ready?
[119:34.68]What am I doing?
[119:35.16]Oh, we're playing this game.
[119:35.98]Okay, put it down.
[119:38.57]Like that.
[119:41.33]Fold it all.
[119:44.53]Hydrate.
[119:53.35]That's rotten.
[119:54.92]That's rotten.
[119:56.70]Oh, that is absolutely rotten.
[120:01.80]I never understood why they put milk in Coca-Cola.
[120:04.43]If it's out for room temperature more than an hour or two, it just goes rotten.
[120:09.36]They need lactose in it for some reason, how the bubbles correspond with the sweetener.
[120:15.18]Some weird bullshit, I don't know why.
[120:16.86]Okay.
[120:19.36]Somebody called me a dork.
[120:20.08]What the fuck did you say?
[120:30.21]Somebody called me wrong.
[120:31.15]I did it wrong?
[120:31.83]How?
[120:34.00]I didn't I'm folding the lines relax the lines are getting folded correctly it's one at a time do you guys I can't wait to do my twitchcon meetup where I'm gonna do the thing everyone's gonna be like oh the thing he's known for right this thing ready like I'm gonna I'm gonna take out a piece of cardboard and be like oh here he goes hey everybody welcome to the Jerma stream
[121:03.67]Everyone's gonna fucking scream.
[121:11.52]He did the thing.
[121:12.28]Dude, he's like known for folding the cardboard and shit.
[121:17.85]Like wicked fucking funnily.
[121:19.85]Alright, that's fine.
[121:28.39]Oh, he did it.
[121:30.01]I think these are all folded correctly, right?
[121:31.99]Just need to put it together.
[121:32.81]No, this one isn't.
[121:34.47]There's a little bit more on that one.
[121:39.11]We're not talking about any more penile stuff, okay?
[121:41.09]I don't want to hear any more crotchal or penile references.
[121:49.16]I will ask twitch.tv to permanently, internet protocol, allow your internet address on my stream.
[121:58.79]forever and you'll be unbannable for the rest of the time you're on site okay um after folding it it will start fitting together with the shape of box okay fold it up like this and then they connect the tabs so they're actually you know I made the joke how this is not worth 70 dollars but I mean honestly though I didn't know it was gonna be this elaborate this is very elaborate
[122:30.95]Maybe like 40 bucks.
[122:32.25]No.
[122:34.31]No, I don't know.
[122:35.05]This is kind of cool.
[122:35.75]Because if I look down, there are a lot of these.
[122:41.36]There are at least six or seven of these.
[122:42.98]Why did we pick the fishing rod?
[122:44.02]Probably the shittiest one to pick.
[122:47.10]Couldn't have started with like the explosive device?
[122:50.38]Right?
[122:50.56]There's like a grenade launcher, isn't there, or something?
[122:52.72]What's even in this box?
[122:53.94]Okay, you got the fishing rod, the piano, the grenade launcher, the bazooka.
[123:01.60]the Dance Dance Revolution pad and a Super Mario Amiibo device.
[123:08.01]I'm getting bored.
[123:10.83]No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not getting bored.
[123:15.46]Just go, go, go.
[123:18.60]No, I wanna make like the grenade launcher.
[123:24.28]Just go, I'm going, I'm going as fast as I can.
[123:26.62]That's not, that's a lie.
[123:28.69]I'm going very fucking slow.
[123:30.71]Alright, I'll get it.
[123:31.53]Here we go.
[123:33.11]Put the top on, insert the tab, insert firmly.
[123:39.13]I missed all of that.
[123:40.23]Fucking pay attention.
[123:42.67]They're spinning it around on me.
[123:43.91]This goes in first.
[123:47.00]This tab goes down.
[123:49.86]And then bottom, top and then bottom.
[123:52.22]And stick it in.
[123:52.70]Okay, you got it.
[123:56.72]Fuck.
[123:58.60]There we go.
[123:59.32]Like that.
[124:01.68]It's in?
[124:03.98]Okay.
[124:04.18]I've got to get to one more.
[124:05.12]Speed it up.
[124:09.03]That's it.
[124:09.95]We'll fold this part and then insert it.
[124:11.45]Look closely at the print to make sure you get the right slot.
[124:24.67]Where is that?
[124:29.60]Where is it?
[124:37.29]where's that piece?
[124:40.67]down here okay so you fold it up and then get it like that and then this goes in here and it goes down all the way through into the next through the slot yeah make sure it goes all the way through the end should poke out the other side
[125:08.96]which it is okay so there's that flip it around fold this piece in half and attach it like so there's another piece that's the same shape but the markings are different go back it's the one with the just the solid color okay so this has to come out
[125:40.52]Engineer of the century.
[125:41.56]I try.
[125:46.45]That looks good.
[125:48.53]And this goes into here.
[125:50.85]This is the right one, right?
[125:52.05]Yeah.
[125:54.35]Flip it around and fold it in half.
[126:01.74]Like this.
[126:09.15]Jeremiah has weird legs.
[126:14.25]What's wrong with him?
[126:16.67]What's wrong with him?
[126:17.13]What do you mean I have weird legs?
[126:19.93]What are you talking about?
[126:22.51]How do I have weird legs?
[126:27.97]They're hairy.
[126:31.45]You want to shave my legs on stream?
[126:34.80]Nobody said that.
[126:35.36]Yes, they did.
[126:36.34]Yes, they did.
[126:42.25]Like a hairy leg?
[126:43.13]Does it get a problem with my legs being hairy?
[126:49.37]No, we're playing Nintendo Labo.
[126:52.77]That's what we're doing right now.
[126:55.56]Stop getting, you guys make fun of me for getting distracted all the time.
[126:59.10]What about you guys?
[127:00.34]What about right now?
[127:02.12]How distracted are you?
[127:03.22]Talking about like my balls and my legs.
[127:06.26]How come, why aren't you paying attention?
[127:08.79]I'm doing a pretty good job, but why are you not paying attention?
[127:13.27]Jesus, Trevor, pay attention.
[127:14.85]What are you doing?
[127:15.63]Let me see your balls again.
[127:17.35]My caramba.
[127:22.99]Alright, fold these in.
[127:31.64]That's all I can do, right?
[127:32.46]Yeah.
[127:33.64]So then now this, how does this fold?
[127:35.52]Around the side, I think.
[127:36.50]So that goes over here like that.
[127:44.68]So this has to go down and then the... What about the arrow piece?
[127:54.93]I guess it doesn't matter.
[127:55.69]I guess it just has to go... Let me see that again.
[127:59.60]So this just goes across and then in the slot.
[128:04.98]Just like this.
[128:10.46]There are two slots here.
[128:11.56]So there's one, two.
[128:18.51]in there I'm gonna scream okay so that's in there it doesn't really feel that secure though I mean it's in there but it doesn't feel like it's really actually in there oh by the way anybody that says the lig word I want you to remove them from Twitch permanently
[128:43.63]Everyone's like oh permanent band is 10 seconds in this channel.
[128:45.81]Yeah, it is and that's the joke But I want a triple permanent band.
[128:49.15]I want at least 30 seconds.
[128:53.06]I Want at least 25 to 30 seconds Alright flip it around The other fit now to the same thing on the other side you can tell it's the right side because the different yeah symbols whatever I
[129:14.12]I hope you guys are happy with your triple life sentence here of 30 seconds.
[129:18.26]That's so... I just think it's so funny.
[129:24.25]Sorry to the mods in advance for this.
[129:28.73]The mods can't three times permaban.
[129:32.31]Somebody ha-ha'd me.
[129:33.47]One guy did.
[129:34.19]I want you to permaban him too.
[129:51.87]They should remove that emote permanently.
[129:53.46]It's mean.
[129:56.66]It is mean.
[129:57.20]Don't do that to me.
[130:00.40]I feel like I got pretty thick skin, right?
[130:02.24]Let's check.
[130:04.60]Yeah.
[130:06.42]Yeah, I guess.
[130:07.76]Alright, let's go over here.
[130:13.41]So this goes on top.
[130:14.45]This one's not as secure in there.
[130:15.61]I don't like how this is.
[130:17.71]Make sure I'm doing this right.
[130:19.25]Same thing.
[130:21.54]Snap it in.
[130:23.32]And then time... More shit to do.
[130:25.36]Hold on.
[130:29.69]Okay, so that's what it's supposed to look like.
[130:33.51]Apparently.
[130:35.45]It doesn't feel very secure, though.
[130:36.73]See how this has just fallen out?
[130:39.65]Snapped in there.
[130:40.27]That didn't do anything wrong.
[130:44.85]This is going to get inserted in something anyways in a minute, so it doesn't matter.
[130:47.41]Okay.
[130:48.49]So now flip this upside down.
[130:51.72]Like that.
[130:53.78]It's backwards.
[130:54.34]Okay, now the piece that looks like glasses, which is this.
[131:03.06]Lay it out printed side down.
[131:06.68]Get the middle pieces out.
[131:09.30]Somebody better laugh at that.
[131:10.22]Okay, then fold it in half.
[131:17.31]Like that.
[131:21.31]Okay, looks good.
[131:21.87]Just make sure people are laughing.
[131:26.14]Okay, good.
[131:27.88]Good.
[131:30.62]Good.
[131:36.49]Oh, let me put this down again.
[131:54.86]Okay, once you fold it, slide it right into the middle there.
[132:00.94]Oh!
[132:02.24]I see.
[132:02.60]Pay careful attention to the markings when sliding this piece.
[132:05.54]It's important to get it facing the right way.
[132:07.66]So there's a marking here.
[132:13.86]Like that.
[132:14.51]This is gonna be so satisfying, I can already tell.
[132:24.37]Am I in the right spot?
[132:26.43]Tell me.
[132:28.19]All the way to the middle.
[132:28.89]Oh shit.
[132:41.57]I almost ripped it.
[132:44.06]Oh!
[132:44.32]Now I'm good.
[132:46.42]So then that's matched up right in the middle here.
[132:50.66]Like that.
[132:51.94]Why is this opening?
[132:52.58]It should be closed.
[132:54.82]Okay, like this.
[132:59.53]Slide it all the way through.
[133:00.49]Oh, fuck you.
[133:01.79]Okay, all the way down.
[133:02.63]Like that.
[133:06.91]It's the right way here.
[133:09.07]And then we're gonna take this, we're gonna stick it in the middle, then slide it from the hole on the left.
[133:13.70]Carefully check the Labo logo on the reel!
[133:45.42]That's correct, don't tell me it's wrong.
[133:55.91]Got it.
[134:04.67]I'm gonna smash this thing when we're done.
[134:07.17]Alright, perfect.
[134:09.67]This piece is going to be our handle.
[134:11.47]There are quite a few folds.
[134:15.40]Get this over here.
[134:19.84]This one right here.
[134:23.61]Move that out of the way, get out of the way.
[134:26.97]Can you, you can see, right?
[134:34.79]This is going to take all night.
[134:35.93]I'm almost, I'm almost halfway done.
[134:39.81]Come on, punch out the bullshit.
[134:46.02]We're still on the fishing pole.
[134:55.08]Check the laps real quick.
[135:12.04]I'm going to be quiet and do this as fast as I can.
[135:14.52]Here we go.
[135:14.84]1, 2, 3.
[135:16.36]Just kidding.
[135:20.10]Folds.
[135:23.10]We are going to speedrun at some point because this might take all stream.
[135:26.62]Just kidding.
[135:33.74]Whoever said Anno Labo, I love you.
[135:40.83]That's so mean.
[135:41.77]What does that even mean?
[135:47.00]This is fairly... This is therapeutic.
[135:50.44]I actually truly believe that.
[135:51.86]This is very therapeutic.
[135:58.18]Guys, there's a whole robot battle set.
[136:02.86]See you for the next like three weeks of streams.
[136:07.16]You know, I...
[136:09.31]First of all, let me talk about this.
[136:10.95]Guys telling stories, not gonna be in the 90 minute time limit.
[136:13.54]Let me talk about this for a second.
[136:15.14]I bought this fucking thing for 300 bucks.
[136:16.88]Do you know why I did that?
[136:21.88]Only for this.
[136:23.50]So if you think for a second that I'm going to spend like $500, $1,000 on the Amazon drone shipping, you think I'm just gonna do this one day?
[136:39.65]No, this is the next two months of streams.
[136:54.27]This thing has actually worked out kind of well.
[137:03.30]This is the pizza box.

[137:54.93]There are a lot of little nubs on this one though.
[137:59.11]Cool, okay.
[138:02.51]This one you could very easily bend it.
[138:03.84]Be careful when you get yours at home.
[138:07.60]I'm just watching somebody suffer.
[138:11.20]I'm not suffering, I'm having a great time.
[138:14.78]This is actually very fun.

[138:31.50]Who doesn't love pizza?
[138:32.42]I mean, I don't.
[138:34.80]I think it's disgusting.
[138:35.62]It clogs your arteries.
[138:36.86]You should eat kale only.
[138:38.29]Alright, let's go.
[138:45.11]Whoa.
[138:45.31]A pair of sunglasses too, huh?
[138:49.67]No, it doesn't.
[138:59.76]Let's see, does it look like sunglasses?
[139:04.00]This is just if you got a superhero mask made and you fucked up and you poked holes where you were supposed to be Frogman.
[139:10.74]Does that work?
[139:15.76]My nose is too big to put on a mask.
[139:17.66]It really is.
[139:18.97]And I'm just looking like, hey, it's my first time putting on a mask before I look good, Mom.
[139:27.15]I can't wear masks.
[139:27.87]My nose is huge.
[139:29.80]Alright, so we're going to flip this around.
[139:30.85]Fold it in half.
[139:36.95]Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[139:37.77]Hold on.
[139:38.23]Where are you getting this one?
[139:39.13]Okay.
[139:44.25]Oh, I did the funny voice.
[139:46.05]Plus 50, right?
[139:46.65]Okay, so this comes down here.
[139:51.20]Like this, right?
[139:54.64]Like that?
[139:56.68]Like a pair of handcuffs?
[140:00.86]The two connected parts are going to form a sandwich around this single one.
[140:05.70]So like this.
[140:16.73]I got it, I fixed it, don't worry.
[140:20.25]Like this.
[140:24.63]I got it.
[140:24.99]Okay.
[140:37.76]I needed a minute.
[140:43.88]Look at that.
[140:48.48]Now I need more washers.
[140:49.62]I need the gray.
[140:50.73]You need the grommet and washer, but this time it's the gray ones, the longer grommet and the blue ones, OK?
[140:54.29]There's only one in here.
[141:01.33]Hopefully that's all I need.
[141:08.86]So where does it go?
[141:13.11]Ass crack?
[141:15.57]Get over it.
[141:20.15]Through the hole in the handle to the sandwich.
[141:23.67]Alright, hold on, hold on, slow down.
[141:26.15]This goes through here.
[141:27.17]Like that.
[141:31.03]And then that goes through the middle of the sandwich here.
[141:36.12]Like this.
[141:41.42]Okay, keep going.
[141:45.56]Flip it around and snap the washer on.
[141:47.45]Like this.
[142:01.33]I hurt myself, I did.
[142:02.55]I hurt myself.
[142:04.71]Okay, so there it is.
[142:09.27]Looks pretty good.
[142:12.69]Oh, look, it's the fucking Enterprise!

[142:30.98]Don't ha-ha that.
[142:31.80]Okay, you can, actually.
[142:32.82]That was worth it.
[142:33.32]That was worth doing a ha-ha for that.
[142:42.70]Don't give me shit for doing the Voyager theme song.
[142:44.74]That's all I know.
[142:47.22]Alright, fold that up.
[142:50.38]I'm a nerd for that.
[142:51.86]Okay.
[142:53.18]Those last packs you went to?
[142:57.53]Wow, you're a fucking nerd.
[143:05.17]Fold this, the Enterprise.
[143:06.67]Oh, I don't even want to do it anymore.
[143:08.80]I just want to keep it as the Enterprise.
[143:13.04]look at that boys and girls alright fold it up roll it up fold it down that's cool I want to see what that looks like in real time this thing okay it's worth 70 I love this thing only get a switch to do Labo everything else on it is don't say that out loud

[143:53.30]This is so cool.
[143:54.04]Alright.
[143:54.28]So then it comes up and down, snaps in.
[143:58.32]That's so fucking cool.
[144:03.76]That's so interesting.
[144:05.92]All three around, right?
[144:09.09]Get it all around.
[144:09.75]Like that.
[144:20.11]And then you tell me this whole thing comes up?
[144:23.66]Oh, shit.
[144:32.80]OK.
[144:33.36]And then now what?
[144:35.14]Then the tabs come up and go in each hole here.
[145:01.65]This is a deer in headlights.
[145:05.33]And now this goes... Where is this going?
[145:08.95]Insert the handle into the center of the reel.
[145:13.66]Is the print on the circle pointing in the same direction as the center?
[145:20.92]What are you doing?
[145:22.16]What the fuck are you talking about here?
[145:25.27]Where is this supposed to go?
[145:53.00]That's the... Alright.
[145:56.06]This side.
[146:16.89]Okay.
[146:19.03]This ain't really staying on there that well.
[146:20.83]It's kind of like shitty.
[146:26.86]Okay, that's a little bit better.
[146:31.22]It's kind of hanging off.
[146:32.06]It's kind of sad.
[146:33.17]Is that lined up?
[146:38.15]It's lined up, though.
[146:38.95]Alright, hold on.
[146:42.95]Fold these two pieces in half and slide them right on.
[146:48.68]They're both the same, so don't worry about which is which.
[146:52.02]Stop it!
[146:52.64]Go back.
[147:02.41]that throw it in the garbage don't say that no we've spent like an hour and 47 minutes on this so fold it in half like this okay and then this goes like this what side am I on I'm on the real side so it's over here this goes in in there
[147:46.92]Okay, that one's in.
[147:51.18]Same thing on the other side.
[147:54.56]No, you turn it around.
[147:56.32]Oh.
[147:56.38]So this goes like this.
[148:06.98]And you got another one here.
[148:21.51]This folds into this one.
[148:27.75]Like this, right?
[148:29.65]Yeah.
[148:35.11]That ain't going in.
[148:36.73]Hold on.
[148:37.11]That's in.
[148:46.25]Okay.
[148:47.79]So that's in there.
[148:48.73]Both of them are in there pretty solidly.
[148:53.31]It's in?
[148:54.17]If so, hold the handle and try turning it away from you.
[149:00.05]Are you serious?
[149:04.38]Wow, it actually works.
[149:06.90]I did it and you can't say I didn't do it.
[149:17.18]Don't do it too crazy.
[149:21.90]Okay.
[149:22.98]There's a lot more to do, by the way.
[149:27.62]Let's do it.
[149:27.98]There's more.
[149:28.36]They got two musical notes.
[149:34.86]Time to insert the music clickety part into the reel.
[149:39.47]One of these is a spare, so don't worry about it, but keep it just in case.
[149:45.25]Flip it over.
[149:45.73]Like this.
[149:52.43]Fold that one in.
[149:55.27]This one in.
[149:55.75]And around.
[150:02.00]Hold on.
[150:02.70]Where is this going?
[150:04.82]This is going Nintendo Labo.
[150:08.40]Nintendo Labo.
[150:17.79]What about this?
[150:22.00]Why don't... Lie it flat against the rod and let it slide into the reel.
[150:26.68]The tabs are pretty small, so the part might be tricky.
[150:31.12]What the fuck?
[150:32.62]Okay, so it goes in here.
[150:33.58]Alright, open up, say ah.
[150:39.00]It's in.
[150:39.46]And then slide the tabs in here.
[150:45.35]Don't break it.
[150:47.49]Got this far.
[150:48.11]Come on, man.
[150:54.16]That's in.
[151:01.57]Okay, that's in there.
[151:02.31]Did I do it?
[151:08.32]Now try turning the handle again and hear that clicky sound.
[151:10.52]That's how you know it's a real fishing rod.
[151:27.36]This is kind of cool.
[151:29.92]This is pretty cool.
[151:36.21]The reel is... I did it.
[151:37.17]I finished one.
[151:37.93]Time.
[151:39.07]Two hours and 32 minutes.
[151:39.97]No, no, no.
[151:40.85]Forget about the pizza joke.
[151:41.71]That's like two hours.
[151:44.49]The reel is finished.
[151:45.69]You finished the first half of the Toy-Con...
[152:14.81]Hey.
[152:16.73]You guys ready for a... You guys ready for an all night stream?
[152:21.89]What do you think?
[152:22.35]It just confirmed it!
[152:32.25]We'll be ending in about 40 minutes.
[152:33.31]Alright, let's make the ocean.
[152:36.55]Get this out of the way, we're done with this.
[152:39.55]Don't the lights just flicker when I touch that?
[152:43.93]Oh no, it's that.
[152:45.26]Alright, what do we need?
[152:48.88]E and F. E and F. These two.
[152:59.03]E and F. I got you.
[153:08.28]What do we need?
[153:08.96]E and F.
[153:16.97]That looks okay.
[153:20.49]He's getting violent.
[153:22.81]I mean, am I, or are you just perceiving it that way?
[153:26.79]It's cardboard.
[153:27.83]I could smack it.
[153:31.30]So take this big airplane looking thing.
[153:37.60]Should I get some wine?
[153:40.62]Should I get a glass of wine?
[153:41.58]What do you think?
[153:44.90]Anybody else drinking wine?
[153:47.45]Why do I, I don't know why, why do I want that right now?
[153:50.43]Did somebody say that in the chat?
[153:52.79]Why do I want wine?
[153:57.42]Oh no.
[153:58.04]I was supposed to take that part out.
[154:02.78]Should I get, should I get some wine?
[154:04.92]Let's do a poll.
[154:06.18]No, I don't care, I'm getting wine.
[154:10.83]I have, like, shit wine in the house.
[154:13.07]I have cooking wine.
[154:15.01]Am I really about to drink, like, shitty cooking, like, pasta wine?
[154:18.63]I don't have any alcohol in the house.
[154:22.21]Besides all the shit I just drank.
[154:23.39]Alright, so I need one.
[154:36.88]Just this one.
[154:37.50]Nothing else from E and F.
[154:43.52]And then everything except this middle piece right here.
[154:46.20]Where the fuck am I?
[154:47.90]Okay, not these.
[154:49.92]No Mega Man canisters.
[154:51.86]Do not take those.
[154:54.84]Just the waffle cooker.
[154:59.17]Rob from Nintendo.
[155:01.45]And the backpack.
[155:09.57]I need the whole thing, huh?
[155:21.04]I bet that sounds so nice right now.
[155:22.74]Okay, take these out.
[155:30.05]That's it, right?
[155:31.27]The wing pieces.
[155:39.43]That's correct, right?
[155:40.13]Okay.
[155:41.45]And just these, this side here, and that's it.
[155:43.83]I still have a lot more to do, though.
[155:46.12]This is elaborate.
[155:47.58]This is way more elaborate than I really thought it was going to be.
[155:51.90]Am I actually going to give Game of the Year 2018 so far to the Nintendo Labo?
[155:57.17]No.
[155:57.67]Why would I do that?
[155:59.09]What else came out this year?
[156:10.15]House Flipper.
[156:12.60]Why is building things and painting walls more fun for me than anything else?
[156:17.46]Don't ask me.
[156:18.08]Okay, that's correct.
[156:20.10]And just this last one right here.
[156:26.76]A House Flipper is actually number one.
[156:30.82]That's not a joke.
[156:34.95]Alright, store these, because there's still a couple pieces on them.
[156:39.01]So I should have five.
[156:41.05]One, two, three, four, five.
[156:49.46]Like that, okay, and then here.
[156:53.74]P is stored in the nice truck.
[156:56.59]Alright, let's go.
[156:58.25]Should I get some wine?
[156:58.89]Alright, I'm gonna be back in.
[157:02.13]I'll be back in.
[157:09.33]How fast can I do this?
[157:15.05]Give me 30 seconds.
[159:11.12]Hey, would you like to make some fucking pasta?
[159:14.74]Because this is what we got to make pasta.
[159:19.62]Let's dump it on there.
[159:20.64]Oh, easy.
[159:21.14]Don't fucking run.
[159:23.21]This stuff sucks, by the way.
[159:24.29]This is the worst wine you could ever drink.
[159:26.47]Why do I want this?
[159:29.23]Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio.
[159:32.69]These were probably 48 cents.
[159:44.83]Well, it looks like Kim ain't going to be making any chicken marsala tomorrow.
[159:48.27]You know what I'm saying, boys and girls?
[160:02.56]Alright, let's go.
[160:06.17]That's not that bad.
[160:06.87]I mean, it sucks, but it's okay.
[160:11.95]Alright, let's go.
[160:12.88]I got my pieces.
[160:13.46]Can you see?
[160:14.64]Can you guys see?
[160:15.00]Can you guys see that?
[160:23.00]Guess what?
[160:23.28]We're building an ocean now.
[160:24.14]Did I just blow your mind?
[160:25.12]What'd I drop?
[160:39.29]Something fell from here.
[160:40.01]Did I drop something important?
[160:53.52]No?
[160:56.62]Stop looking at me!
[160:58.12]Stop it!
[160:58.70]I need to... Jesus fucking Christ.
[161:21.53]Fuck off!
[161:24.84]Alright.
[161:27.94]This is going to be the base of our tiny ocean.
[161:29.66]Make sure it's strong.
[161:30.46]Try creating the fold lines firmly.
[161:31.92]There's a fold.
[161:32.52]Alright.
[161:45.44]Cool.
[161:53.23]Yeah, what are you guys doing?
[161:54.04]I can shit in here and I can piss in here and you would never know.
[161:57.86]Nobody would know.
[161:58.68]I'm going to piss in it right now.
[162:09.43]It's clear, but it's fine.
[162:11.81]I'm wearing like a bag dress.
[162:13.33]What, are you going to probably wear a bag dress?
[162:19.04]Get over it.
[162:28.88]Looks good.
[162:31.98]My huge fucking pulsating arm is getting in the way.
[162:36.14]Sorry, guys.
[162:39.00]Oh, easy.
[162:51.19]We can see your groceries.
[162:53.53]Oh, fuck off, mate.
[162:57.87]Should I fold these up too?
[163:14.16]Game suck, game doesn't suck.
[163:17.88]I will be the first to tell you if this game sucks, game doesn't suck.
[163:24.04]This is really fun.
[163:26.87]Don't you dare next me here.
[163:28.41]I'm sorry, I'm having a great time.
[163:32.31]This is, I'm having a blast right now.
[163:34.12]This is the best thing on the whole fucking shitty system.
[163:46.68]I'm just riling feathers, I'm just kidding.
[163:48.62]The Switch is great.
[163:49.40]Hey, and guess, you know what I heard?
[163:51.96]Guess what?
[163:53.16]Before anybody calls me out on this,
[163:55.51]They're making a new WarioWare for the Switch.
[163:57.47]Not one of those bullshit dog shit pretend ones like they made for the Wii U. Remember Game and Wario?
[164:05.26]That was a trash can game.
[164:06.48]They're making a real WarioWare for the Switch.
[164:09.44]That alone is worth buying this whole console for.
[164:12.72]When WarioWare comes out, buy one of these.
[164:15.27]Have one of these.
[164:15.99]Because it's going to be fucking amazing.
[164:19.37]It was for 3DS.
[164:21.13]What?
[164:23.49]It's 3DS.
[164:31.02]Don't buy one of these.
[164:31.64]They're not worth it.
[164:34.10]Look, if you want to play one of the best Zelda games that's come out in the last 10 years, okay.
[164:38.45]If you want to play Mario Odyssey, which is probably the best Mario game they've ever made, besides Mario 64, sure, get it.
[164:43.55]Yeah, that's worth it.
[164:48.25]It's worth it.
[164:50.37]It's a good console.
[164:50.99]It is.
[164:52.15]Have I folded the same lines five times in a row?
[164:54.55]64 is shit.
[165:00.80]You're fucking with my childhood name, man.
[165:02.14]Alright, let's go.
[165:02.52]Alright.
[165:08.79]And this is going to be the top section.
[165:10.11]Remember, print it side down.
[165:11.39]Remember!
[165:15.57]One sip.
[165:18.00]It's gonna be gone.
[165:30.09]Hold it up.
[165:35.75]Get over it.
[165:36.13]I need some cheese.
[165:42.73]Why do people mix cheese and wine together?
[165:44.89]What's wrong with you?
[165:48.71]You know what would be really good with this alcohol that tastes like somebody put their ass in my face?
[165:53.77]A bunch of gross cheese.
[165:55.43]By the way, I just found out my cholesterol is too high.
[165:59.63]I got 220 cholesterol, guys.
[166:01.46]That's got to come down.
[166:03.50]That's not good.
[166:06.78]I have my physical, because before I go to Nevada, I want to make sure, Nevada, sorry, idiot.
[166:12.32]I want to make sure I'm doing alright.
[166:13.28]220 cholesterol.
[166:17.42]I got to start eating Cheerios.
[166:18.40]Remember those commercials?
[166:24.38]Stop eating pizza.
[166:26.18]I don't even eat pizza.
[166:27.20]I got this like every day.
[166:30.72]Alright, that's fine.
[166:32.06]Don't fold the same thing over and over again.
[166:35.08]Oh, it's a little box.
[166:37.91]It's like making a house of cards.
[166:42.21]This goes down here.
[166:56.26]Have you got it the right way?
[166:57.16]Pay attention to the markings and slots.
[166:58.66]I got it.
[167:01.72]Insert these two short tabs into the slots on either side.
[167:04.53]Don't worry, we'll be anchoring them firmly in place soon.
[167:22.55]He's not going to go in here.
[167:28.19]He's not even going to go in here, Nintendo.
[167:35.90]It's not even going to go in there.
[167:37.20]False advertising.
[167:39.34]Okay.
[167:39.98]What do you mean?
[167:41.40]It's not the wrong way.
[167:44.40]That's the right way.
[167:45.00]What are you talking about?
[167:46.34]It's the right way.
[167:46.82]It's not the wrong way.
[167:47.50]Look.
[167:49.86]Look, I'll make it so you can see it the way that the angle is showing on the TV.
[167:53.44]That's the correct way.
[167:56.20]I had it right.
[167:58.00]You think I know what the fuck I'm doing?
[167:59.05]Give me a break.
[168:02.99]Give me a break.
[168:04.93]We're gonna anchor it again soon, so just get him in there, I guess.
[168:09.39]Just let it sit there.
[168:10.25]Okay, that's fine.
[168:20.14]Alright, have you got it in the right section?
[168:25.82]Yep, it's inserted.
[168:27.14]Fold these tabs over and insert them carefully one at a time.
[168:37.59]That's better, okay.
[168:40.35]I'm insecure.
[168:41.01]Okay, tell it to my therapist.
[168:44.77]He'd love to hear it.
[168:47.57]That goes in here.
[168:55.00]good okay alright so this is anchored now oh this is cool it actually the thing is it actually okay I'm gonna give you guys a review of the Nintendo Labo so far you know expectation versus reality
[169:22.03]This ship actually does what it's supposed to do on screen.
[169:25.89]This actually does... It actually works intended.
[169:29.69]It actually works.
[169:30.93]Okay?
[169:32.03]If you think it's not worth $70, it's fine.
[169:35.05]But it does exactly what it does on screen.
[169:38.49]It actually works.
[169:44.07]Now it's time to put a cap on the front.
[169:45.49]As usual, crease the folds.
[169:48.26]No, it works.
[169:48.88]It actually does work.
[169:49.54]I thought it was going to be a piece of shit.
[169:51.39]I'm being pleasantly surprised by Super Nintendo here.
[169:56.63]I did not think it was going to be like this.
[170:02.83]You know when you go to McDonald's and you look at the menu?
[170:05.77]This is the Big Mac on the menu in the drive-thru.
[170:13.79]Not like this, right?
[170:17.02]I ordered a Burger King Big and Tasty.
[170:21.02]That's what I get.
[170:22.90]Doesn't look like what it's supposed to look like on the fucking menu screen.
[170:26.12]In fact, I don't want anyone to know I even made this.
[170:30.08]Get this fucking out of here.
[170:34.60]See how much force I did with that?
[170:39.18]No, no.
[170:39.96]What do you mean no?
[170:43.18]I could put it back together with some fucking glue and tape.
[170:45.30]It's fine.
[170:46.46]Alright, spin it around, get this middle part out of here.
[170:51.86]Young Todd Howard confirms it just works.
[170:55.67]What, you think I'm mad that I look like one of the most successful people on the fucking planet?
[171:02.61]Guy that has everything?
[171:04.03]God, this guy's got everything?
[171:05.39]And I'm supposed to be upset about that?
[171:07.39]I mean, yes, he keeps making the same game every year.
[171:11.42]Doesn't mean he's not fucking talented.
[171:19.06]I'm being like a borderline dick.
[171:22.48]And I'm just kidding.
[171:24.07]Those of you guys that are new to the channel, we're just fucking around here.
[171:26.81]This webcam is not even correctly lined up.
[171:30.45]How am I supposed to get new followers like this?
[171:38.98]How am I supposed to get any fucking new followers like this?
[171:41.16]Not even right still.
[171:52.23]That's better.
[171:53.87]Okay.
[171:57.08]Balls.
[171:58.04]Shut up.
[171:59.10]No, don't shut up.
[172:00.16]Just be quiet.
[172:02.32]This goes on like this.
[172:03.40]Into the tabs here.
[172:21.54]So is the Switch going here?
[172:23.00]Do I have to take the Switch out of the thing and put it in here?
[172:25.18]I don't understand.
[172:26.74]I don't get it.
[172:28.60]Make sure it's stable.
[172:32.62]That's this piece.
[172:39.07]Wait, did it just say?
[172:41.05]This is where the Nintendo Switch console will go.
[172:43.27]Are you guys going to be able to even see this?
[172:49.21]It's not even capturing it anymore at that point.
[172:55.28]Well, you will see it from the camera.
[172:57.86]I guess, right?
[173:02.69]That's fine.
[173:04.19]How's that going there?
[173:06.07]This goes up like that.
[173:09.81]Crease along the fold lines.
[173:15.87]This goes like this.
[173:18.59]Sits on here like this.
[173:21.11]Goes in.
[173:24.91]Is it the right way?
[173:25.59]Yeah, it is.
[173:26.31]Okay, this goes in these two slots.
[173:31.15]I don't think I feel comfortable putting my $300 piece of equipment in a piece of cardboard, but you know, whatever.
[173:35.79]Okay.
[173:45.86]Next piece comes in, and now we'll put a little hat on it.
[173:49.22]Cease to fall, a hat.
[173:52.32]Why does it need a hat?
[173:56.47]Fold, fold, fold, fold.
[173:57.45]Just get me to the part where I put it on.
[174:04.95]Fold.
[174:05.25]Crease that.
[174:09.99]R9K, please.
[174:10.85]Why would I have somebody being bad?
[174:15.61]Somebody being a bad boy in chat here?
[174:17.55]Do I have to get involved?
[174:20.19]Whoops.
[174:26.74]Did I say something about, yeah, I have 220 cholesterol.
[174:28.80]My cholesterol's too high.
[174:31.54]I don't know what to do about it.
[174:32.26]I gotta eat Cheerios.
[174:35.86]I got in an argument with the nurse, actually, on the phone.
[174:38.64]I told her I was bullshit.
[174:40.82]It's like, how do you argue that?
[174:43.02]It's not like, it's not like you got a bad price for, like, your floors being removed and replaced.
[174:48.69]Yeah, you know, you got, no, no, no, no, no, I don't think so.
[174:50.81]It's like, they took my blood.
[174:54.07]I argued with her.
[174:56.42]I didn't believe it, I couldn't believe it.
[174:59.10]She's like, yeah, your cholesterol is a little high.
[175:01.54]A little high?
[175:03.78]Okay, what do you mean, what?
[175:06.29]Well, you see your cholesterol is like, hmm, it's about 30% too high.
[175:13.67]You're at 220.
[175:14.29]I'm like, okay.
[175:17.12]I was like, how is that possible?
[175:20.70]I weigh like 154 pounds.
[175:23.58]Well, sometimes it's genetic.
[175:24.58]I'm like, no, there's no way.
[175:25.58]My father doesn't have it.
[175:26.40]My mother doesn't have it.
[175:27.62]I don't have any cholesterol in front of my family.
[175:35.33]I essentially told her to prove it.
[175:38.11]And she did, because she has my blood.
[175:42.77]So I'm going to start eating fish more often.
[175:44.23]And I eat a lot of fish anyways.
[175:45.35]I don't know how the fuck it's possible.
[175:48.24]This goes up like this.
[175:51.28]Like this, right?
[175:54.25]I have your, hey, I have your blood.
[175:57.51]Right?
[175:57.95]Why is this incorrect?
[176:03.47]There we go, okay.
[176:05.45]So this goes like this to here.
[176:11.24]Fish are friends, not food.
[176:16.28]Well, you can think that if you want, but I eat them.
[176:20.15]And this goes... What is this telling me to do?
[176:23.71]Fold this part over so it fits inside.
[176:25.64]It should be easy, thanks to the fold lines we creased before.
[176:28.20]A little handbag?
[176:34.62]A little handbag.
[176:39.69]You guys hearing like... What the fuck is that?
[176:41.97]Is it coming through the ceiling?
[176:45.05]Alright.
[176:46.85]It's like this.
[176:53.45]like that right that's correct yeah oh no it's gonna be flat that's fine I got my little handbag it's the window again no no one's here this goes upside down like this
[177:20.97]slide this piece onto the big tab at the top of the main structure that's so cool just it's set you know oddly satisfying right that's cool then it goes down and in right okay
[177:51.62]So that's in.
[177:54.70]Spin this around.
[177:57.60]What goes in here?
[177:58.64]Now we need more washers.
[178:01.40]Blue washer.
[178:08.65]No, don't take these out.
[178:10.65]Thankfully, we're down to the last couple of washers.
[178:12.33]Just take them out.
[178:12.79]I don't care.
[178:14.15]Just don't lose these.
[178:15.23]Put the rubber bands and the spaghetti over here.
[178:20.35]Deep, why are you wearing a bag?
[178:23.15]Because people are hysterical.
[178:26.16]People are absolutely hilarious.
[178:28.00]Okay, so here we go.
[178:34.34]So that goes underneath.
[178:37.70]And then snap it on from above.
[178:39.16]Okay, so this goes under here.
[178:42.46]Like this.
[178:45.38]And then this washer goes down here.
[178:49.96]Snap it.
[178:53.00]Done.
[178:59.58]I feel like someone's trying to get my attention from upstairs.
[179:02.02]Like, hey, quit making fucking shitty boxes.
[179:05.64]Alright.
[179:09.03]Done.
[179:09.53]The ocean is done.
[179:16.47]So far, okay, cool.
[179:18.84]Wow, you made an ocean, well done.
[179:20.10]You finally earned yourself a break if you want one.
[179:35.42]I made that joke already, sorry.
[179:37.17]Did it twice, that's terrible.
[179:52.15]Seven parts from ENF.
[180:08.46]This is like, who the fuck is down here, man?
[180:11.96]There's like pizza boxes.
[180:13.35]I'm gonna say fuck.
[180:21.22]Too far, too far, don't look at that screen.
[180:35.79]Alright.
[180:47.14]Good.
[180:48.26]I'm happy with how that looks, let's go.
[180:52.88]It's like the magicians that eat the razor blades and they go
[181:22.81]I need to use these, hold on.
[181:27.53]That's fine.
[181:27.97]I need these two pillars.
[181:37.80]Two dog bones, two razor blades.
[181:39.62]Make it look nicer.
[181:46.52]Shit.
[181:47.10]Okay.
[181:49.00]And we're done with this.
[181:50.78]Wanna see me punch through this thing?
[181:52.59]Check this out.
[181:57.38]Pretty fucking strong.
[182:07.22]E and F. I'm moving anyways, who fucking cares?
[182:13.87]I'm gonna take a sledgehammer to this wall in like a week anyways, doesn't matter.
[182:24.27]And then this thing, okay.
[182:28.35]Yeah, moving to Vegas.
[182:31.59]If you don't know, yeah, I'm moving to Las Vegas.
[182:35.89]So what is this for, this thing here, this piece right here?
[182:39.74]See on the screen there how it's not blinking?
[182:41.38]It's, I guess, maybe an extra piece?
[182:43.68]Because there's two of them.
[182:44.56]There's one on E and there's one on C. Somehow.
[182:49.88]Because of Bitcoin regulation.
[182:51.48]Don't listen to fucking Star.
[182:54.99]There's nothing to do with Bitcoin.
[182:56.33]I don't own enough Bitcoin to give a shit about that.
[183:02.78]I don't want to live in Vegas, man.
[183:10.88]Does it have a little grill on it?
[183:11.98]Yeah, take the grill off.
[183:16.27]Dermot eats the 19.
[183:21.61]Bitcoin is the normie coin.
[183:24.25]I have a, guys, I trade in all kinds of cryptocurrencies.
[183:28.39]I'm so, I love it.
[183:30.15]I broke it.
[183:30.94]This one was in my mouth, so I fucked it up.
[183:33.86]God damn it, this one, I put it in my mouth.
[183:40.34]Normie coin.
[183:41.22]What's wrong with BTC?
[183:42.67]Is BTC, you don't like BTC?
[183:44.25]Why?
[183:44.55]It's the Normie coin.
[183:53.49]I'm not, why are you saying normie?
[183:55.21]Don't say that word.
[183:56.26]I say that word sometimes and I don't mean to.
[184:01.78]Just stop it.
[184:03.10]Okay.
[184:04.36]Dogecoin is better.
[184:05.42]Okay, that's the, you just said the normie coin.
[184:09.39]That's the like, LOL, look at this funny normie coin.
[184:13.13]You just said it.
[184:13.61]Look at how little these are.
[184:17.55]I'm not gonna get these out.
[184:20.85]Haha, normie.
[184:25.36]Can I call it something else?
[184:30.79]Normies get out.
[184:31.73]No!
[184:32.19]No, no, no, no.
[184:32.77]Normies can stay here.
[184:33.81]Everyone's allowed here.
[184:37.29]No, that's...
[184:54.09]You know, I was thinking about this the other day.
[184:57.27]Like cryptocurrency.
[184:58.31]If I talked about what my favorite cryptocurrency is right now, you could deem it as like insider trading.
[185:06.12]Hey guys, I found this new project and it's really, really fucking cool.
[185:11.76]It's like, oh yeah?
[185:13.86]Go get it.
[185:18.06]So I'm not going to do it.
[185:25.24]BitConnect.
[185:27.12]BitConnect, you know the crazy thing?
[185:28.83]I cannot believe.
[185:30.91]So BitConnect, people still buy that fucking coin.
[185:34.59]I don't understand why.
[185:36.55]Why are you purchasing that?
[185:39.45]Holy shit, this thing is a scam and it fucking went under completely.
[185:42.57]There's no use case for it.
[185:44.35]I'll take 10,000 of them.
[185:45.81]It's meme value?
[185:50.49]No, it's getting delisted from every single, there's a moth in here and I'm gonna eat it on stream.
[185:57.32]Don't even think about putting the at symbol in front of my name on Twitter.com.
[186:03.00]Go.
[186:03.84]I have them all, right?
[186:04.66]Seven.
[186:05.86]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven of nine.
[186:09.79]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[186:11.79]Okay, good.
[186:18.57]That's the last of the pieces we need for the fishing rod.
[186:20.96]Don't get rid of the extra pieces, though.
[186:22.48]They'll come in handy later.
[186:23.50]Okay.
[186:26.24]Let's store sheets C and E safely away in the box.
[186:33.82]Printed side down.
[186:36.65]I did all the folding already.
[186:37.71]I preemptively did this.
[186:38.97]I didn't do that though.
[186:42.91]Okay, hold on.
[186:45.11]So from this side.
[186:48.21]Is the fishing rod the most complex?
[186:53.51]I think they're all like this.
[186:56.24]I think they're all fairly complex.
[186:59.78]At least it seems like that on the box.
[187:02.92]Piano is probably really complex too.
[187:06.88]Fold in this side here.
[187:08.40]Fold up and this comes over.
[187:16.49]This goes through here and into here.
[187:26.38]Like that.
[187:31.46]Flaps where we come down.
[187:32.60]Yeah, insert that.
[187:36.47]These flaps fold these tabs on the sides all the way over and lay them inside nice and flat.
[187:41.35]These have to go flat inside.
[187:43.03]Looks like this.
[187:53.29]This is Minecraft for idiots.
[187:56.79]What does it have anything to do with Minecraft?
[187:59.91]This is not Minecraft.
[188:04.06]Minecraft, no, it's just like a fun little toy to piece together a piano and a little robot toy.
[188:11.30]This is the game of the year for 2018.
[188:13.12]Wait, hold on, I gotta pay attention.
[188:17.32]Slide this round part on the side.
[188:19.52]There are two of these round parts, but why don't we just leave one for now?
[188:22.96]So right here.
[188:29.29]I forgot to test the audio.
[188:31.15]Ready?
[188:31.87]I'm gonna count and you're gonna tell me if it's synced up.
[188:33.69]Ready?
[188:35.22]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[188:40.04]Ready?
[188:41.26]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[188:44.63]It's the fucking three hours into the stream.
[188:56.93]It's muted.
[188:58.41]It's not, wait.
[188:59.39]Wait, hold on, try it again.
[189:03.98]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[189:11.40]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[189:21.05]It brings something else besides like a 2014 Twitch meme into the mic muted bullshit.
[189:27.90]Alright, slide that on, did it, right?
[189:31.58]Same thing on the other side?
[189:32.34]No?
[189:32.86]Okay, hold on, I gotta raise the blade.
[189:34.88]With the printed side down, fold this piece neatly in half.
[189:37.64]Like this.
[189:41.32]Fold it in half.
[189:41.89]Like this.
[189:50.79]Can you see that?
[189:52.61]Can you see, by the way, cut the fingernails if you didn't notice.
[189:56.82]Nice and short.
[189:57.64]Where does this go?
[189:59.88]In the middle?
[190:06.67]Two rubber bands from the back.
[190:12.19]One, two.
[190:19.61]Slip the rubber band through the slit so it hooks on to the hole in the middle.
[190:38.45]Okay.
[190:41.61]We're ready to slide this piece into the middle opening.
[190:46.89]Jesus Christ, okay.
[190:50.94]So, into here.
[191:00.79]Like that?
[191:05.31]Shut the fuck up.
[191:08.82]okay that's in it's in right good to go nice and tight at the end sick there are two copies of this piece as well fold it in half and slide it through all three of the slots
[191:49.89]Like this?
[191:51.61]Slide it down the middle here?
[191:57.68]This.
[192:08.59]Easier said than done, Nintendo.
[192:13.01]Oh, fuck.
[192:13.55]This is difficult.
[192:15.75]That one.
[192:16.13]And one more.
[192:26.28]Got it.
[192:26.52]OK, it's in, right?
[192:27.98]All the way?
[192:29.46]Rub a band?
[192:30.90]T in there?
[192:43.28]Other side, same thing, right?
[192:48.50]This looks like a closed... Okay, I'm not going to read that next to that word.
[192:53.04]Same thing on the other side.
[192:53.90]Okay.
[193:02.80]I got excited!
[193:03.58]Just calm down.
[193:05.94]So, same thing on the other side.
[193:08.50]Slip it on there like a nightgown.
[193:11.56]Good.
[193:16.34]Okay.
[193:17.36]Fold this up.
[193:18.41]Stick that shit in the middle with a rubber band on it.
[193:20.35]Like that.
[193:29.99]Right in the middle.
[193:32.90]Wrong side, you fucking idiot.
[193:39.18]It's falling apart.
[193:39.76]Why?
[193:39.88]Okay.
[193:48.40]I need tiny hands.
[193:50.26]I need way smaller hands to do this part.
[193:52.88]Have I got small hands that can like take this from me and do this?
[193:56.70]Ow, what happened?
[193:57.90]Ow, what the fuck?
[193:59.86]Look at this.
[194:00.40]This hurts.
[194:08.82]You can't even see it.
[194:09.78]It hurts.
[194:11.17]I've got like huge indents.
[194:18.43]Look at this.
[194:18.73]Look at these fucking horrible indents.
[194:23.63]You can't- I've got a bag on!
[194:32.92]I'm protecting myself!
[194:40.28]I'm confident in my body.
[194:47.16]Three and a quarter.
[194:53.94]You got that shitting grin.
[194:59.72]So that's good.
[195:02.02]Both sides have it now, right?
[195:08.59]Then this piece folds.
[195:09.71]I'll make sure I'm doing this right.
[195:11.75]Goes in.
[195:12.85]Big piece folds in.
[195:14.27]Down the middle.
[195:15.53]Okay.
[195:16.93]Fuck off.
[195:18.39]Not you guys.
[195:18.89]The game.
[195:24.84]A shower and a diaper?
[195:28.28]More efficient that way.
[195:29.14]You don't get your member... Okay, hold on.
[195:31.64]I've got to concentrate because this is actually pretty tricky.
[195:34.60]It's going to go all through a hole.
[195:36.52]All three holes.
[195:40.40]One.
[195:44.42]Two.
[195:48.44]Get in there, you fucking idiot.
[195:50.07]Come on.
[195:50.97]Don't make me look bad on stream.
[195:52.73]Don't do it.
[195:53.49]If there's one thing I can't stand, it's looking bad on stream.
[195:56.41]All I care about is what people think about me on the internet.
[195:58.41]Come on.
[196:04.12]Oh, my God.
[196:13.02]He's putting it in.
[196:13.66]Alright.
[196:18.87]They're wrong.
[196:19.29]They're gonna be... They did it wrong.
[196:32.58]Fuck.
[196:35.06]It's upside down.
[196:51.93]What are they going to say about me?
[196:55.06]What if they say he's an idiot?
[196:57.78]What if they say he's an idiot?
[197:00.80]Hey guys, what's up man?
[197:01.68]We're just checking out this new thing called the Nintendo Switch.
[197:03.70]What if they think I'm an idiot?
[197:06.61]It's kind of tricky to get it right.
[197:10.13]Sometimes you have to use a little bit of nuance and go ahead and hit that like button.
[197:13.45]What if they think I'm an idiot?
[197:15.51]What if they think I'm an idiot?
[197:22.27]Okay, so it's going to go like this.
[197:28.91]There we go.
[197:32.75]Crisis averted.
[197:35.23]Looks good to me, right?
[197:38.53]Both keys are in.
[197:41.43]Looks pretty good.
[197:42.09]What to do with this?
[197:46.84]Alright.
[197:52.95]Now we're going to need the long orange piece of string.
[197:55.51]And this guy will need to tie knots on both ends.
[198:00.54]This is where it ends.
[198:16.04]Didn't even need 10 seconds.
[198:28.53]Didn't even need five seconds.
[198:34.31]Oh, Jerma, you're terrible.
[198:35.46]You want to do a square knot in less than five seconds?
[198:38.14]Can you do that?
[198:40.16]Is that on your resume?
[199:10.95]Need a little bit more space up here.
[199:19.31]Quiet.
[199:38.38]Now it's going in the nose and it's coming out my mouth like one of those fucking guys that does it with a snake.
[199:51.20]That actually kind of hurt.
[199:55.94]Okay.
[199:59.07]I think, I think, am I bleeding in my nose right now?
[200:01.41]It smells like blood.
[200:05.43]No, this thing smells like blood.
[200:06.95]Okay, we're fine.
[200:09.34]Ah, both.
[200:09.86]Did it say both hands?
[200:12.83]Both hands.
[200:37.28]That's a little too much.
[200:51.68]Okay, that's both ends have that little knot, right?
[200:54.56]Okay.
[200:56.06]What's next?
[200:58.84]Both ends tied tightly.
[200:59.86]Yep.
[201:07.82]Push the knot through this hole in the box.
[201:10.95]It's a tiny hole, but the X mark shows you exactly where it is.
[202:01.40]I'm fucking it up.
[202:03.02]I'm fucking it up.
[202:04.48]Don't fuck it up.
[202:05.20]Come on.
[202:06.06]Got it.
[202:06.32]Okay.
[202:17.91]Done.
[202:19.97]Now to roll the string up, make sure you turn it the right way.
[202:26.32]Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, spin, spin, spin.
[202:30.74]This is taking a while.
[202:31.87]Roll, spin.
[202:33.33]Just roll it up.
[202:54.76]No kinks.
[202:55.80]No kink bullshit.
[202:56.98]Okay, looks good.
[203:03.05]Am I actually gonna cast this line out?
[203:06.31]No way, right?
[203:07.17]That's not actually gonna happen, is it?
[203:19.94]Now what do I do?
[203:23.48]Okay, now that should be enough for now.
[203:27.54]This goes... Nemo Slack.
[203:31.36]So this goes underneath in here?
[203:39.80]What does this want me to do?
[203:40.61]So wrap it around and then up the hole.
[203:46.73]Slide the end of the string through the eyelet from underneath.
[203:48.89]What the fuck are you doing?
[204:01.31]Like that?
[204:01.79]Okay.
[204:07.06]Hook the rubber bands on the sides through the three slots on the ocean?
[204:12.98]What the fuck?
[204:22.81]Wrong way?
[204:23.41]What do you mean wrong way?
[204:25.25]That's not the wrong way.
[204:31.07]This is the right way.
[204:35.05]In here and then around this.
[204:39.90]So that's one rubber band in.
[204:42.40]The other one on the other.
[204:43.26]This is crazy.
[204:44.38]This is going to be an actually functioning fishing rod.
[204:56.29]It sets in.
[204:58.69]See, look at the rubber bands.
[205:02.99]I guess?
[205:10.07]OK.
[205:10.95]So now what?
[205:13.19]Be sure to keep the whole thing nice and level.
[205:15.01]If it's at too much of an angle, the spool won't work very well.
[205:20.93]There's a little cockeyed in there.
[205:22.13]Hold on.
[205:28.65]It's alright.
[205:29.07]That looks better.
[205:29.57]Alright, that looks good.
[205:33.00]That's pretty straight, right?
[205:37.94]Fix it.
[205:38.22]I just fixed it.
[205:38.70]I'm fine.
[205:39.20]I fixed it.
[205:43.69]Okay.
[205:46.47]Let's attach the string to the rod now.
[205:48.85]Keep the rod nice and short.
[205:51.97]So this... Oh, Jesus Christ.
[205:55.65]Okay, hold on.
[205:58.30]So this...
[206:05.27]So this comes in like this.
[206:06.51]So spool it through the three circles.
[206:15.24]Oh, Jesus.
[206:16.28]This is insane.
[206:18.62]OK.
[206:19.84]Through the three circles and then out through here.
[206:37.21]I just got... I got very angry right there.
[206:41.17]I did.
[206:41.75]I'm not gonna lie.
[206:44.83]More slack?
[206:45.43]I'm gonna get more slack.
[206:50.15]And then this goes through the... Shit.
[207:00.46]Finally inserted deep into the reel's marking.
[207:03.04]If it ever pops out, you can just push it back in.
[207:04.62]Okay.
[207:17.32]Jesus Christ.
[207:21.28]How the fuck am I gonna get it in there?
[207:22.64]Fuck.
[207:34.22]Get in there.
[207:35.60]Don't break it though.
[207:44.59]It's going in.
[207:46.87]Almost in Hold on calm down And we're gonna be to play the fucking fishing game that I'm excited for this.
[207:56.73]I really am this is This is a lot of fun.
[208:00.47]Alright, so the knob the knot is almost in there Okay, the knob is in there It ain't coming out Okay
[208:15.14]Now what the fuck do I do with this?
[208:19.00]The knob is in.
[208:24.40]Stop that?
[208:25.04]What do you mean stop that?
[208:27.07]What's the next step?
[208:30.59]Oh, and don't forget to close up the front back of the ocean.
[208:36.91]This thing has to stop.
[208:40.18]What a fucking disaster that would have been.
[208:42.28]Okay, that's fine to sit here.
[208:47.76]That goes in, this closes.
[208:56.20]Alright, that's it.
[209:02.76]The string is all ready.
[209:04.68]Time to check that everything works.
[209:06.14]Make sure you have plenty of room so you don't bump into anything or anybody.
[209:12.77]Stretch out the rod all the way so it's nice and long.
[209:17.22]I must've just knocked up the fucking wine.
[209:18.56]Okay, hold on.
[209:32.41]Fuck.
[209:37.39]Is there a Wii weight system?
[209:39.23]Alright, nice and long.
[209:47.67]Okay.
[209:49.51]That's correct.
[209:53.23]Now try moving it up and down.
[209:54.39]Does the string roll nicely in and out?
[209:56.77]It does, right?
[210:05.92]That's fucking dangerous.
[210:09.40]It does.
[210:13.64]Holy shit, that's fucking cool.
[210:15.89]Yes, it does, Nintendo.
[210:18.54]I'm so excited for this.
[210:19.85]I really am so excited.
[210:21.13]Yes, it looks great.
[210:27.79]The spool is complete.
[210:28.67]This last step is pretty simple, so if you feel ready to go, let's do it.
[210:32.72]I'm ready.
[210:34.62]Five out of five.
[210:36.32]Inserting the Joy-Con.
[210:39.34]Get your console and the Joy-Con ready.
[210:44.47]You guys are gonna lose connection.
[210:50.81]Have you got them?
[210:51.33]I got them right here.
[210:55.57]They get the first one.
[210:56.67]Stop it.
[210:57.29]Wait.
[211:01.43]First one goes in like this.
[211:02.69]Like that.
[211:11.28]Oh no, I just bought this.
[211:12.84]Fuck you.
[211:13.56]God damn it.
[211:23.71]Okay, it's in.
[211:26.31]There's grease on it.
[211:27.63]So that just slides in.
[211:29.33]Now for the left Joy-Con, again, position it to match the icon and push it all the way into the reel.
[211:40.30]That's in.
[211:41.76]That's in all the way, right?
[211:42.90]Looks pretty good.
[211:43.46]Okay.
[211:47.16]Let's go.
[211:47.94]Next one.
[211:52.99]So this turns now.
[211:54.27]This next is the right Joy-Con.
[211:57.01]Match the icon and holder and push it all the way in.
[212:01.19]So like this.
[212:02.01]Like that.
[212:10.58]That's in.
[212:14.58]Okay.
[212:17.63]That's in there.
[212:20.42]Now what?
[212:21.38]Do I have to go get this?
[212:22.70]I don't like this being like that though.
[212:25.14]That seems very flimsy.
[212:26.66]I'm going to put my Switch in there.
[212:30.38]Insert the Nintendo Switch console into the ocean and close it up with the hat.
[212:37.66]Oh, I don't like this.
[212:56.64]I lost the instructions.
[212:58.86]The power button should be at the top.
[213:02.22]So like this?
[213:07.92]This is fucking freaking me out.
[213:23.35]Okay, it's in.
[213:24.97]That's in.
[213:31.54]This, I don't like how this feels.
[213:34.93]I'm gonna turn this off.
[213:39.69]This feels really flimsy.
[213:47.90]Okay.
[213:49.48]So let's go forward then.
[213:53.01]Is this correct?
[214:01.92]The con fishing rod is complete.
[214:03.50]Alright, let's play it.
[214:10.27]You guys ready to play?
[214:15.67]Three, two, one.
[214:19.71]I can't wait.
[214:24.26]Can't see.
[214:27.88]When playing with the toy con fishing rod, be mindful of your surroundings.
[214:33.86]Okay, here we go.
[214:34.32]Oh, let me zoom it in a little bit.
[214:49.51]Attach the toy con to the fishing rod.
[214:52.71]You guys can't even see it.
[214:54.83]It's too bright.
[215:03.93]It's, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[215:11.21]Turn on flux?
[215:14.81]It's in there.

[215:20.52]I wish you could see this.
[215:23.38]Look at how cool this looks.

[215:30.36]This, I can see my rod in there.
[215:32.05]Oh, hold on.
[215:33.57]I'll fix this.
[215:48.83]Do you see?
[216:04.42]You can see it, right?
[216:07.60]The switch has its own brightness controls?
[216:10.92]You can see that though, right?
[216:12.15]Hold on, I can zoom in a li- I want you to see my fucking cool movements!
[216:15.91]Now how do I cast it?
[216:18.21]How do I cast?
[216:33.90]You don't fucking care about me.
[216:34.96]Can you see?
[217:01.44]How do I cast this?
[217:02.44]Wait, just...
[217:38.13]Alright, who gives a shit?
[217:39.19]You can see it just fine.
[217:40.19]How do I cast?

[218:12.02]Oh wait, there we go.
[218:12.48]Alright, grab a fish.
[218:13.76]Here we go, I'm gonna get one.
[218:17.56]Alright, let's do it again.
[218:41.77]Cast it.
[218:43.51]How do I cast it?
[218:50.57]What did I just do last time?
[219:01.14]Lower the rod?
[219:04.10]Oh, shit.
[219:08.96]Big fish.
[219:18.02]Got a big one!
[219:28.64]This is fucking cool.
[219:30.00]This is so cool.
[219:36.57]Let's go deep sea.
[219:45.85]I'm taking my fucking time with this, by the way.
[219:53.52]Giant crab?
[219:58.95]Somebody bite.
[220:04.69]Come on.
[220:05.35]Give me the crab.

[220:45.41]It actually works.
[220:46.81]Did I lose him?
[220:47.93]Where'd he go?
[220:50.35]I lost him.
[220:50.91]What?
[220:51.13]I got to slow down.
[221:05.88]Alright.
[221:06.48]Nice.
[221:06.60]I got another one.
[221:07.24]Big one.
[221:18.29]There's a flounder.
[221:21.33]No, I hit the fucking wood.
[221:34.11]This is so cool.
[221:35.31]Actually, you can actually fucking do it hard.
[221:39.85]Okay, I gotta be careful of the wood.
[221:42.66]Oh, by the way, we're definitely doing another one.
[221:44.38]No way.
[221:45.52]The stream's not over.
[221:46.46]Not even close.
[221:47.75]This is too much fun to not do another one.
[221:52.43]Give me the shark.
[221:56.31]I gotta get one deep sea fish.
[221:57.61]Come on.
[222:02.51]Come here.
[222:03.79]You little dick.

[222:23.85]There's this wood in the way.
[222:27.47]Okay.
[222:39.28]You gotta release the tension when he starts freaking out.
[222:59.76]The stingray did it.

[235:25.54]Alright, piano.
[235:28.96]Hold the Joy-Cons in both hands.

[235:42.54]Uh, what do I need?
[235:56.06]That looks a little heffery.
[235:59.51]There are six steps to- hold on.
[236:01.99]I shouldn't have done this one.
[236:05.25]Okay, six steps.
[236:07.27]One, two, three, four- this is fucking so cool.
[236:11.74]This is so cool.
[236:14.27]I thought I was going to hate this thing.
[236:15.53]Make sure you get the plastic bag with the special parts.
[236:19.31]Do I need to reuse those?
[236:20.75]Do I need to cannibalize the fishing rod?
[236:23.27]Somebody tell me.
[236:24.25]Drunk.
[236:29.24]Drunk.
[236:31.62]Okay.
[236:33.20]We'll be aware of that.
[236:35.96]Drunk.
[236:42.63]Drunk off pasta wine.
[236:48.78]If you knew how bad this tasted.
[236:50.24]Alright, that's fine, we're good.
[236:52.90]Let's get this going.
[236:53.90]Making the main body of the piano.
[236:57.75]A and B, don't bend them.
[237:14.42]A?
[237:21.80]B?
[237:24.72]That's not right.
[237:27.64]Oh, this is the house, okay.
[237:36.25]House, house, this is all the house.
[237:41.61]Where the fuck is the piano?
[237:46.90]There's all the motorbike.
[237:51.05]Where's the piano?
[237:53.71]Don't fuck these up.
[237:55.49]Slow down.
[238:02.90]Okay, here it is.
[238:03.84]It's over the bottom.
[238:06.26]Okay, here's A. A, B, C.
[238:12.27]G, E, F, G, H, I, J. This is going to take 12 hours.
[238:26.13]Oh my god.
[238:28.65]OK.
[238:31.97]Holy shit, guys.
[238:39.22]OK.
[238:45.32]Jesus Christ.
[238:58.91]Let's go.
[239:01.11]What time is it?
[239:01.57]10, it's only 1040, we're fine.
[239:04.58]Couple hours, 10, 11, 12.
[239:05.56]I'm happy, I'm having a good time, so I don't care.
[239:10.64]My hair could see better days though.
[239:15.53]Alright, shut up.
[239:18.05]A and B. So here's A. There's two A's.
[239:23.44]This is not even correct.
[239:24.28]This is some light bulb thing.
[239:26.36]There's not even a piano.
[239:27.54]Get out of here.
[239:30.94]A?
[239:47.54]So we need those parts in A and B. Why don't I just take them all out?
[239:50.52]Who cares?
[239:51.06]Alright, get them out.
[239:52.73]He's broken the seal.
[239:53.47]That means he's going to finish it, right?
[239:55.55]I broke the seal.
[239:56.15]That means I have to do it now.
[239:58.01]I was going to give up.
[239:59.19]I broke the seal.
[240:04.44]Hydrate.
[240:05.48]You got it.
[240:15.21]Should I break it off my head?
[240:16.97]Should I smash this off my head?
[240:19.42]Get more viewers?
[240:19.96]What do you think?
[240:29.16]Shit, it almost broke, dude.
[240:30.16]You hear that?
[240:42.59]That's fine.
[240:42.91]You can sit right up here.
[240:46.02]It's on top of the camera.
[240:46.90]That's fine.
[240:48.52]Didn't think I had another one.
[240:54.10]This stream is a fever dream.
[240:59.60]Wake the fuck up, dude.
[241:06.30]Losing viewers rapidly.
[241:07.90]Why?
[241:08.30]What?
[241:08.70]Why?
[241:09.26]What did I do?
[241:09.80]I gotta get him back.
[241:11.72]Alright, hold on.
[241:15.72]Aim B. What did I do?
[241:19.64]Why am I losing viewers rapidly?
[241:21.50]For what?
[241:21.90]What happened?
[241:24.10]Okay, I gotta go.
[241:31.43]I am losing.
[241:32.09]There was like 4,000 people there.
[241:33.33]What happened to them?
[241:37.59]I was like drinking wine.
[241:40.65]Wait.
[241:41.61]This doesn't come up right now.
[241:44.45]Just this?
[241:46.78]This thing is so, this is going to be so much more complicated.
[241:50.72]I can already tell, I can smell it from a mile away.
[241:53.98]People sleep, Gerber.
[241:55.96]Yeah, that's true.
[241:57.36]That is true.
[241:58.44]It is getting late to you.
[242:00.48]That makes sense.
[242:03.32]Okay.
[242:05.36]One, two, three.
[242:05.92]That's all I need right now.
[242:08.12]Anything else come up?
[242:08.78]This back does.
[242:11.98]Okay.
[242:12.68]So I can put this aside for now.
[242:18.43]Okay, let's go.
[242:20.09]Hurry up and do something so you don't lose a fucking thousand more viewers.
[242:24.45]Goddamn top 1,000 streamer.
[242:28.03]Act like it.
[242:31.94]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[242:32.84]Welcome back to a Labo stream.
[242:34.58]Today, we're gonna build a piano.
[242:36.64]You know, like, do-do-do-do-do-do.
[242:37.64]Can't wait.
[242:38.06]It's gonna be so much fun.
[242:39.54]So let's get started here, okay?
[242:41.92]So we've got six pieces from C and D. Let's get those.
[242:53.08]Make sure you all on the stream.
[242:54.92]C&D.
[242:55.70]Six pieces.
[242:56.22]These... More are leaving.
[243:03.03]How do I get them back?
[243:05.01]Use your Amazon Twitch Prime on me.
[243:06.93]Maybe they'll listen.
[243:07.55]Maybe they'll come back.
[243:09.11]twitch.tv/Amazon Prime.
[243:11.08]Use it on me.
[243:12.06]Will that make them come back?
[243:13.36]Will they use it on me?
[243:14.86]Maybe.
[243:15.36]Okay, this is fine right here.
[243:17.24]Make sure you know you can... It works.
[243:27.44]One, two, then this.
[243:29.58]Fuck, man, these things are so fragile.
[243:31.89]This cross comes out.
[243:37.31]Bottom piece here.
[243:39.67]Tell me to take them all out.
[243:42.21]It actually worked.
[243:43.53]Hey, thank you so much for the sub, man, Twitch Prime.
[243:46.63]You know, if you guys didn't know, if you have a Twitch Prime, if you have an Amazon Prime account, you can use your Amazon Prime, log in through Twitch,
[243:56.42]And you can subscribe for free to any of your favorite streamers.
[244:00.70]Remember, it doesn't have to be me, but it could be anybody else that you know, but it could be me too.
[244:05.83]Remember, it doesn't have to be me, but it could be somebody.
[244:08.93]Fucking give me a break.
[244:13.65]Subscribe and leave.
[244:21.03]Why am I so sweaty from cardboard?
[244:22.47]Because it's...
[244:24.30]It's 100 degrees in this room at like 78%, 80% humidity in Massachusetts.
[244:31.06]I have no AC in this room.
[244:32.72]I'm dying in here.
[244:35.90]It's like 80 or 90% humidity in Massachusetts right now at like 100 degrees.
[244:39.58]If you're lucky, I'm alive right now.
[244:42.60]Alright, that's good.
[244:45.72]Yeah, one, two, three, four, five.
[244:47.49]Then the big piece here, this huge one.
[244:50.19]There's only one piece in this whole thing.
[244:52.21]It is big.
[244:55.74]Jeremy, why do you stream in that room that has no airflow?
[244:57.88]Because I fucking don't give a fuck, you know what I mean?
[245:01.35]You know, I like to say that, like, I don't give a fuck.
[245:03.09]You know what I'm saying?
[245:06.21]Like, I don't give a fuck.
[245:07.75]People think it's cool when I say that, you know what I'm saying?
[245:12.03]Because I didn't pay the money to put an AC vent in here.
[245:16.17]We call that deficient in brain power.
[245:19.09]That's what they call that.
[245:23.92]I have a big belly.
[245:31.55]Fuck.
[245:47.74]Cholesterol's 220, I'm not kidding.
[245:50.10]I have to like slow down.
[245:51.30]No more cheese, I'm eliminating cheese from my diet.
[245:56.75]Getting dairy completely out of my diet.
[245:58.55]Only drinking almond milk and coffee and stuff.
[246:02.49]220 cholesterol at 155 pounds.
[246:03.45]Are you fucking kidding me?
[246:06.11]I try to eat healthy and it doesn't work.
[246:08.99]Alright, that's good.
[246:15.06]Ass cam.
[246:15.58]Whatever.
[246:17.54]That's good.
[246:18.64]Let's go.
[246:20.66]Don't forget, if you have any trouble, you can use the back and forward buttons.
[246:22.94]I know how it works.
[246:26.56]There's a bug in here.
[246:28.24]I'll catch it in my mouth.
[246:30.27]I swear to God, I'll try.
[246:32.76]Can you see it?
[246:33.60]It's right here.
[246:36.56]If I catch this in my mouth, I deserve $100.
[246:44.79]I'm in a mood tonight.
[246:45.61]I don't know why.
[246:46.03]Alright, let's go.
[246:47.75]So we need, what piece are we using?
[246:51.43]This one, right?
[246:52.91]Yeah.
[246:54.17]So then the printed side facing down like that.
[246:57.78]The key to a good Toy-Con construction is to fold firmly along the fold lines.
[247:01.74]Shut up, Nintendo.
[247:04.70]That's good.
[247:05.44]Right there.
[247:06.04]Okay.
[247:09.34]I kind of want to move some of this out of the way.
[247:12.60]I don't need the other Joy-Con.
[247:14.06]Get it out of here.
[247:18.34]I'm having so much fun, by the way.
[247:21.18]I hope you guys are having a good time because I'm having a blast.
[247:23.35]I really am.
[247:23.97]This is so much fun.
[247:25.71]Okay, let's go.
[247:27.02]Fold all the lines.
[247:28.06]I've done this before.
[247:29.06]Let's do it quick.
[247:29.58]There we go.
[247:41.10]I actually know how to play a few songs on the piano.
[247:43.22]That's not a lie.
[247:44.48]So if this is a functioning piano, I'm going to play at least a handful of songs for you guys.
[247:51.07]That's not made up.
[247:52.15]Just wait to the end of the stream.
[247:58.25]I know actually, I know how to play the piano.
[248:00.65]As insane as that sounds, it's true.
[248:03.73]Took lessons for about nine years.
[248:10.18]Should I fold this one?
[248:14.18]Yeah.
[248:15.56]Now I gotta fold, I have to fold.
[248:16.62]No, maybe not.
[248:17.56]Yeah, I do.
[248:19.24]That's so thin though.
[248:21.56]You see what I mean?
[248:22.08]Look at how thin that is up here.
[248:25.05]That's a thin piece.
[248:26.61]I guess I do.
[248:27.41]It just showed me to do it.
[248:31.49]Damn, that's thin.
[248:34.07]Look at that.
[248:34.41]Look how thin this is.
[248:35.83]I'm not okay with that.
[248:36.85]Look at that.
[248:37.93]You see what I'm talking about?
[248:39.65]Look at this tiny little fucking piece right here.
[248:42.97]See that little nub?
[248:43.79]I have to fold around that thing.
[248:48.39]No fucking way, dude.
[248:49.99]Holy shit.
[248:50.69]Look at that.
[248:51.07]Are you kidding me?
[248:57.04]Whatever.
[248:57.42]Fucking careful.
[249:03.57]I got it.
[249:05.95]I feel stressed.
[249:06.69]Me too.
[249:11.29]Couple more.
[249:11.81]One more nub.
[249:26.60]Alright, everything has been folded.
[249:27.94]Let's get the next piece.
[249:33.12]Wait, is there more?
[249:33.90]No.
[249:35.38]Okay, let's build it.
[249:37.17]So now, these come up like this.
[249:49.72]What?
[250:02.54]Oh, okay.
[250:03.34]Alright.
[250:07.78]So that folds over.
[250:11.02]Nah, I didn't do it backwards.
[250:12.00]I had to fold this over like this.
[250:14.22]And then these pieces come up.
[250:15.92]I was going to say, what the fuck is going on?
[250:29.84]Two hours, by the way?
[250:30.78]Whatever, we're going all night.
[250:32.80]care if I have 30 viewers at the end then the next two come up right one two one okay then this whole thing comes up so it's up and then up like that sleepover yeah you guys are sleeping over
[250:55.92]This means there's no stream tomorrow, by the way.
[250:58.40]We go for, like, all night into tomorrow morning.
[251:01.36]There ain't no stream tomorrow.
[251:04.23]Today's Monday, technically, right?
[251:09.61]It's hot?
[251:09.99]It is hot.
[251:13.39]You'll be too hungover?
[251:14.45]I'm drinking fucking two wines!
[251:17.84]You guys need to relax.
[251:23.36]We've got plenty of time.
[251:24.10]We'll be fine.
[251:25.42]This folds up like that.
[251:28.32]This thing comes over.
[251:31.76]Like this, right?
[251:35.69]This thing flips over and a tab goes in.
[251:38.85]Flips over.
[251:41.21]That.
[251:41.97]This tab goes in here.
[251:44.69]Like that.
[251:50.56]Drunk off two bottles.
[251:51.60]I'll blow into a breathalyzer right now if I have to.
[251:55.03]I'm at like 0.004 alcohol.
[251:58.73]Blood content.
[252:02.40]Drunk off two fucking wines.
[252:09.48]I don't have a breath.
[252:10.18]I don't have one.
[252:10.96]Whatever.
[252:11.97]Alright.
[252:12.33]Fold the tabs.
[252:13.67]This comes all the way down and that goes in.
[252:16.07]So that goes like this.
[252:18.31]This way.
[252:19.19]And then folds across.
[252:22.13]Does the tab go in there?
[252:24.27]It does.
[252:25.01]Of course it does.
[252:40.14]This is the game of the year.
[252:42.64]I hate to say it.
[252:43.26]I really do.
[252:53.07]I love it.
[252:56.30]This is worth buying a Switch for.
[252:57.60]It really is.
[253:00.78]Stream over.
[253:02.66]Who said that?
[253:08.43]The stream's not over.
[253:09.23]What are you talking about?
[253:13.19]Better than God of War?
[253:15.37]I haven't played God of War yet.
[253:21.43]Ban that guy?
[253:22.07]It looks fun.
[253:23.41]You know what?
[253:26.76]It's just interesting to do.
[253:29.86]It's fun to do.
[253:32.20]I talked a lot of shit about this console and about this whole thing in the first place.
[253:37.87]Redact all my statements.
[253:38.87]This is a lot of fun.
[253:40.21]It just is.
[253:45.37]Alright, let's keep going.
[253:48.71]How much are they paying you?
[253:49.53]Nintendo doesn't do sponsored streams.
[253:51.66]Nintendo deletes YouTube videos.
[253:53.40]Why would they pay people to play their game?
[253:55.08]What are you talking about?
[254:00.64]Good thing these aren't... Fuck.
[254:12.67]Did that get on anything important?
[254:15.47]Yeah, it did.
[254:16.63]Whatever.
[254:18.61]I lifted the wine shot out and landed on the Labo stuff.
[254:21.92]It's okay.
[254:25.18]Um...
[254:27.89]shut up don't look at my lower area okay carefully fold the tabs and insert them uh yeah but uh to reiterate again this is by far some of the most fun I've had playing a game and I'm not even playing a video game I'm folding up cardboard in my hands take that you want an endorsement the Labo is really cool worth buying a switch over we get it
[254:58.34]We get it, dude.
[255:00.01]Move on.

[255:05.91]I'm gonna get a lot of fun game.
[255:08.75]Wait, where am I going?
[255:13.08]So this is... Put this around.
[255:17.64]No, I'm not... Whatever.
[255:19.06]Alright, we're gonna fold this back.
[255:26.35]He's mocking us for not having a Labo.
[255:28.17]Back off.
[255:36.81]We get it.
[255:37.31]You're having fun.
[255:42.28]God damn it.
[255:49.80]This goes around like this.
[255:52.68]Well, I only, I reiterate it so much because I talk a lot of shit about video games.
[255:57.02]I really do.
[255:59.34]To a point where I almost have to repeat myself to make sure people realize I'm not kidding around.
[256:03.30]Alright, stick this into the light socket, which is here.
[256:13.69]So the other way.
[256:16.33]Oh, that pulls, that clicks in there.
[256:17.97]Alright, that's cool.
[256:19.01]Like this.
[256:26.05]slides all the way in and then it should click come on don't blow it what are you doing ready that felt good nice and secure let's go
[256:55.27]Did you get all the way through?
[256:56.17]There should be a little gap between the tabs and the flat piece, which there is.
[257:01.73]There is a little gap.
[257:05.87]Flip this upside down.
[257:06.90]Now we'll like that, okay.
[257:12.34]Now we're gonna anchor the socket in place of these two pieces.
[257:15.64]They're both the same, so don't worry about it.
[257:16.92]Alright, so we need these two, right?
[257:21.33]We get it, you're having fun.
[257:25.45]repeating myself god damn broken record man okay shiny Jerma I can't do anything about it I'm sorry I'm gonna be sweaty and disgusting it goes here this goes they're both the same thing so it doesn't matter right he's turned on right now and then where do these go
[257:54.24]right neatly in half slide of one end of the tiny gap so like this I think over here yeah this is gonna be so interesting it just barely fits that feels so good to do that same thing on the other side right
[258:27.34]Like this.
[258:39.76]Looks pretty good so far.
[258:42.90]Yes, I was able to insert them all the way through.
[258:48.22]Shiny, I can't help it.
[258:49.40]I'm sorry.
[258:51.61]Nothing I can do.
[258:55.89]You have to deal with a sweaty fucking man.
[258:59.47]If I would have pad my face with a toilet paper right now, it would come back in 10 seconds.
[259:04.52]So who cares?
[259:08.76]Repeating himself.
[259:09.40]Alright.
[259:11.06]I won't repeat myself for the rest of the stream.
[259:13.58]Guaranteed.
[259:16.41]I will.
[259:20.11]Walk with the main body.
[259:20.93]Let's get it.
[259:30.70]Let's get some folds here.
[259:31.58]This is the main body.
[259:37.38]Okay.
[259:39.20]This one comes up here.
[259:40.24]A little tight on the edge, but that's fine.
[259:44.36]I did not repeat myself.
[259:54.52]That was sad.
[259:59.05]This little tab here needs to come up.
[260:03.15]He's flexing.
[260:05.00]I always have to be flexing so you know how jacked I am.
[260:10.94]How does that?
[260:11.44]Are we good?
[260:11.90]Okay.
[260:13.58]Yes, we are.
[260:14.58]What does that look like?
[260:15.26]220 cholesterol to you?
[260:18.17]Because it is.
[260:28.54]That's so sad.
[260:30.23]I can't have any more decent food.
[260:32.97]Gotta eat fucking spinach and shit.
[260:36.27]Cheerios.
[260:39.27]Honey Nut Cheerios.
[260:40.21]I mean, they're good, but are they worth eating every day?
[260:42.45]Probably not.
[260:43.73]Seriously.
[260:47.03]We have a lot of money just came in.
[260:48.41]Hold on a second.
[260:50.92]Spoon?
[260:52.30]Spoons for self-defense.
[260:54.02]Thanks for $50, man.

[261:15.45]Oh, he made me repeat myself.
[261:16.57]Okay.
[261:18.87]Well, you got me.
[261:22.81]Okay, do I repeat myself a lot, though?
[261:25.83]I mean, sometimes I do, but all the time, do I?
[261:27.72]I do.
[261:33.96]A little, maybe a little.
[261:36.92]Sometimes.
[261:42.42]I reiterate.
[261:43.24]I mean, I don't repeat, but I reiterate.
[261:53.61]All the unimportant things.
[261:55.71]I just ripped out like four hairs.
[261:58.29]I need these.
[261:59.53]They can't go away.
[262:00.67]I'm getting to that age where every single one counts.
[262:09.02]Alright, we're fine.
[262:09.80]Oh, no, it looks bad.
[262:11.28]Fuck me.
[262:12.24]I just pulled out like two more.
[262:13.36]Alright, we're good.
[262:19.27]Alright, go.
[262:20.47]Go.
[262:20.81]I don't want a four o'clock in the morning stream.
[262:22.73]Maybe I do.
[262:29.79]Base part, I got it right here.
[262:33.33]Not much to fold on this.
[262:37.03]Okay, really not much to fold on this at all.
[262:38.88]Let me move this out of the way.
[262:41.48]This is important?
[262:44.46]Important?
[262:46.68]I don't think so.
[262:48.16]Tell me if I, okay, no, don't tell me anything.
[262:52.24]Spin it around, what do we got?
[262:53.84]This thing, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[262:55.16]We're not using this yet.
[262:56.44]Keep it up there.
[262:57.26]Base part, there it is.
[262:59.64]Correct way.
[263:00.24]Good.
[263:01.90]I'm bald.
[263:03.26]You know, during the PUBG mobile when I got to first place, great fucking top 1,000 video game player, somebody said you have a bald spot on the back of my head.
[263:11.57]That's not true.
[263:12.41]Let me reiterate this.
[263:14.07]Let me repeat this.
[263:15.95]Take a look.
[263:17.91]Bald spot?
[263:18.75]There's my hair part, right?
[263:20.51]There's the part in my hair.
[263:23.88]Where's the bald spot?
[263:25.24]Part in my hair.
[263:26.70]Part in my hair.
[263:28.68]Bald?
[263:31.52]Where is it?
[263:34.50]Where is it?
[263:36.16]That's where my hair is parting.
[263:37.76]In the middle.
[263:41.25]I got a lot of shit for that.
[263:42.19]People said I had a bald fucking spot in the back of my head.
[263:46.13]Get over it.
[263:54.60]It's worse than I thought.
[263:55.56]What do you mean it's worse than I thought?
[263:57.04]This camera's HD.
[264:00.94]See?
[264:07.49]Look at the hairline.
[264:08.95]It's not even that bad.
[264:10.03]Give me a break.
[264:11.13]I mean, well, with a HD camera, it's kind of bad.
[264:18.73]I'm 33.
[264:19.27]I'm only 16.
[264:21.38]Give me a break.
[264:24.76]You guys act like I'm fucking 17.
[264:45.75]You thought I was younger than Vinny?
[264:48.99]I think we're the same age.
[264:49.89]I turned 33 in September.
[264:54.22]In September, I turned 33.
[264:55.16]It's not fucking old.
[264:58.28]It's young.
[264:58.68]It's wicked young.
[264:59.62]Alright, hold on.
[265:01.64]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[265:02.54]Next slide.
[265:04.18]The wall piece into the base from above.
[265:06.20]Alright, so this is the wall piece.
[265:08.62]So it comes up like this.
[265:09.50]I thought you were 40.
[265:12.05]I'm even younger than you thought.
[265:13.67]That's good.
[265:15.78]So this goes over here.
[265:17.54]So this is the wall piece, like that.
[265:20.80]Goes in here like this.
[265:26.80]Okay, that's in there.
[265:36.31]Super important.
[265:37.21]Wait, hold on, this is super important.
[265:40.39]Super important.
[265:42.01]Check the direction of the socket.
[265:49.00]I'm younger than Vinny?
[265:52.10]We're all superhuman anyways, doesn't matter.
[265:56.54]Like if Vinny has superpowers, I have superpowers, we're all superhuman.
[266:00.16]It's one of the criteria to be a Twitch partner.
[266:05.37]You have to have superpowers.
[266:07.89]Just like the wall, slide the back side of the piano onto the bass from above.
[266:13.77]And then we're connecting these two.
[266:16.59]Okay, so this comes in like this.
[266:23.21]I have lightning powers?
[266:24.27]No, I don't.
[266:26.71]I have the power of fucking Injunition.
[266:34.37]Yeah.
[266:40.08]There is a spider.
[266:40.90]Okay, sure.
[266:42.14]Thanks for the heads up.
[266:45.70]Injunition.
[267:05.71]Intuition.
[267:07.69]That's what I have.
[267:10.01]Just fucking see things and perceive things from a mile away.
[267:17.28]Two hours, by the way?
[267:18.22]I told you we were going all night.
[267:19.44]You guys didn't believe me.
[267:24.98]Alright, go like that!
[267:26.11]And that's how you know you're done with this piece.
[267:27.47]Alright, live the piano.
[267:32.88]Wait, Nintendo, I said wait.
[267:40.43]What time is it?
[267:41.57]11 o'clock.
[267:44.72]Find it.
[267:45.80]Give me a thousand fucking Jerma dollars.
[267:48.14]Hey, you can do his flash, you can't.
[267:53.52]What am I doing?
[267:54.06]This, okay.
[267:55.50]Fold this in half.
[268:11.76]I need to clean up tomorrow.
[268:13.05]Seriously.
[268:15.17]Apologize to Nintendo?
[268:16.37]For what?
[268:20.11]I just told you this is one of my favorite games.
[268:22.07]One of my favorite experiences of 2018.
[268:25.37]My nose is stuffing up.
[268:28.27]Why?
[268:32.07]If I get sick, I'm going to be so pissed off.
[268:35.04]I was in New Hampshire for the weekend.
[268:36.36]I swear to God, if I got sick, I'd lose my mind.
[268:52.70]It's like an even worse version of Uptown Funk.
[268:54.72]What does that mean?
[268:56.24]Are you insulting me?
[268:57.86]Should I be offended by this?
[269:06.15]Oh, I can't hear the music.
[269:07.11]I don't have my headphones plugged in.
[269:11.79]Is it too loud?
[269:15.05]I can see how it could be loud.
[269:17.33]Sweaty, sick streamer.
[269:19.87]Don't act like you...
[269:24.39]Nevermind.
[269:24.83]It's gonna get me in trouble with Twitch.db.
[269:37.22]Where's the pizza?
[269:39.44]You know what?
[269:40.00]You're right.
[269:54.07]He should have been here four hours ago.
[269:56.67]Where this was relevant.
[270:03.04]Nope.
[270:04.00]Swallow it like a man.
[270:33.31]I do, I want some pepperoni though.
[270:43.12]That sounded like throwing a baseball into a fucking brick wall.
[270:51.38]It's like shooting a fucking gun.
[270:55.02]My cholesterol, I can't eat that anymore.
[270:56.95]No more.
[270:58.35]Stop letting me do that.
[271:05.06]I'm not eating that pizza.
[271:05.88]It's disgusting.
[271:06.54]That shit's been sitting there.
[271:09.86]Not only for how long?
[271:11.24]Four and a half hours?
[271:12.05]No, no, no.
[271:13.33]No, I bought that pizza like six hours ago.
[271:17.41]I kept the boxes and the pizza for the fucking joke and I was sitting there like, no, I'm not eating that pizza.
[271:22.76]Fine.
[271:23.34]Fine.
[271:33.79]I can't, it's, no, not happening.
[271:37.61]No way, not in a thousand years.
[271:45.25]Take your socks off, get out of here.
[271:50.13]Alright, fold it and then flip it over.
[271:51.33]So this folds up and the whole thing turns over.
[271:58.66]Remove my socks or prerecord it.
[272:00.16]No, get out of here.
[272:01.86]That's not gonna, no, no way.
[272:05.56]Where's the other one?
[272:13.61]This turns like this.
[272:17.05]Both sides fold up?
[272:18.87]Whoa!
[272:19.21]Wait, wait, hold on a second.
[272:21.23]So it folds over, and then it folds it backwards.
[272:24.76]Okay, that's interesting.
[272:28.02]So it goes like this.
[272:31.84]And then like this.
[272:36.67]Interesting.
[272:37.37]Okay.
[272:37.99]Same thing on the other side.
[272:38.77]Yep.
[272:41.94]Makes another little razor blade.
[272:47.18]That.
[272:49.00]And then over.
[272:51.42]Okay.
[272:52.78]Little blade.
[272:55.10]I'm not taking my socks off on stream.
[272:58.65]What do you guys think this is?
[272:59.67]Alright, you blew... Okay, you blew my mind.
[273:05.49]Hold on a second.
[273:07.00]and then like this and then check the direction of the parts here the mark is the so like this okay that's correct it's a tie fighter
[273:36.87]It kind of looks like one.
[273:37.57]Alright, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[273:38.61]This goes, slide them firmly into these openings.
[273:41.81]If they're too stiff, you can slide the tabs in one at a time.
[273:45.45]So Nintendo Labo, like that.
[273:48.45]So this goes in here.
[273:52.95]One and two.
[273:55.71]Don't force it.
[273:56.51]Don't mash it in there like a fucking moron.
[273:59.75]There's one, two.
[274:08.40]Okay.
[274:10.18]There's pizza grease all over this.
[274:12.20]How the fuck did I even pick up one of those stupid slices of pizza like a moron?
[274:15.52]Look at that.
[274:18.44]There's grease all over it.
[274:21.45]Fucking idiot.
[274:24.43]I'm pissed off about that because this is a piano.
[274:26.17]This is the most expensive one.
[274:31.01]Okay.
[274:31.31]That's in there.
[274:31.87]Good.
[274:32.15]Flip it around.
[274:36.33]Got these two, get this out of the way for a second.
[274:38.87]Got these two nubs here.
[274:42.61]Wash my hands.
[274:53.19]Clean.
[274:58.53]Both are sticking out, yes.
[275:01.37]Gross, why?
[275:02.41]Like you don't do that when you eat a bag of Cheetos?
[275:04.25]Give me a break, guys.
[275:05.90]Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.
[275:10.78]Oh, so when you eat a bag of Cheetos and your hands are covered in Cheeto dust, you go wash your fucking hands.
[275:17.55]No, you do not.
[275:19.75]You fucking stick your hands down your throat.
[275:23.25]No, you don't.
[275:23.87]No, you don't.
[275:24.73]No, you don't.
[275:25.57]You do not do that.
[275:26.93]Nobody does that.
[275:27.53]Give me a break.
[275:30.51]So you eat a bag of Cheetos and then you go wash your hands.
[275:34.76]I don't believe that for a second.
[275:35.80]I just don't.
[275:37.94]You go like this and you slide your finger over your bottom teeth, pulling all the Cheeto dust with it.
[275:47.91]Nobody does that.
[276:04.60]This is why you have bad cholesterol.
[276:08.44]I eat kale and spinach and shit.
[276:11.87]No, I have bad cholesterol because I love cheese.
[276:14.93]Heavy cheeses.
[276:17.31]I can't get enough of heavy cheeses.
[276:18.79]I eat them all the fucking time.
[276:20.95]Sharp cheddar.
[276:22.11]Swiss cheese.
[276:23.67]Hard fucking sharp cheddar.
[276:25.31]I love it so much.
[276:26.91]I'm never eating it ever again.
[276:32.44]Heavy liquids.
[276:33.30]That happens too, man.
[276:34.74]It's bad.
[276:40.38]Pole it?
[276:40.70]What do you mean pole what?
[276:41.66]If you lick your fingers after eating Cheetos?
[276:44.46]They've made commercials on that.
[276:46.16]Of course I know it's going to be like 50-50.
[276:50.72]I'm not going to do a pole if you eat the cheese off your hands.
[276:53.38]I know the answer already.
[276:57.93]Oh my fucking god.
[277:01.57]Hey guys, do you eat the cheese off your fingers?
[277:09.42]Answer this truthfully or I'm gonna be fucking mad.
[277:20.13]After you eat Cheetos, do you eat the cheese off your fingers?
[277:27.73]You can wash your hands afterwards, that's fine.
[277:32.73]Let's find out what the fucking world really thinks.
[277:43.15]Oh, I'm sorry.
[277:45.95]Is this a 70% versus 30%?
[277:49.97]So you talk about 70% of everyone in this chat eats Cheetos off their hands when they're done.
[278:01.13]Jeremy, you're disgusting.
[278:03.37]Add me to the list.
[278:14.06]Fake news.
[278:15.46]I just put a poll in the chat.
[278:16.89]That's all I did.
[278:18.07]I didn't do anything else.
[278:22.13]I washed my hands.
[278:23.03]I didn't say I didn't wash my hands after.
[278:24.91]I just said I go like this and I drag my bottom teeth on it.
[278:30.00]Cheetos are gross anyways.
[278:30.98]Don't eat them.
[278:31.46]Eat a better alternative.
[278:33.02]Like pirate booty.
[278:33.90]Alright, let's go flip this over.
[278:37.08]What do you mean there isn't a question?
[278:45.43]The question is... Cheese off of fingers after... You know what I'm saying here.
[278:59.40]Look at that spread, 70% of people do this.
[279:03.34]And I'm the sick fuck, apparently.
[279:21.29]Back, I gotta build the lab up.
[279:23.33]Give me a break, hold on.
[279:26.21]What time is it?
[279:27.23]I want this done by one o'clock in the morning.
[279:33.65]God damn it.
[279:36.55]Where's the small box?
[279:41.01]What did I do with it?
[279:50.06]Where's that small box?
[279:59.18]What is that?
[279:59.64]Where's that coming from?
[280:16.98]I gotta, gotta, gotta get it.
[280:17.86]It fell off.
[280:18.62]Okay.
[280:18.98]So this is probably these two pieces on.
[280:26.52]What did you miss?
[280:32.28]Fold these up.
[280:33.28]Get this out of the way.
[280:34.14]I'll do it in here.
[280:37.40]What's the title?
[280:39.38]The fucking Nintendo DIY pizza box?
[280:42.17]That's kind of what we're doing.
[280:45.17]Clean my room.
[280:45.99]No, you clean your room.
[280:48.61]I'll clean my room when I feel like it.
[280:49.97]In like a year.
[280:53.28]That's good.
[280:55.84]One, two, three, four pieces all folded up.
[280:59.08]So where does this go?
[281:06.84]Make it a little box.
[281:09.05]Put it in the lid.
[281:11.89]Whoa, okay, hold on.
[281:13.29]So there's a little circle here.
[281:14.43]This is so cool.
[281:15.27]I fucking love this.
[281:17.41]This is so stupidly interesting.
[281:21.72]Make a little cube.
[281:22.72]And this little cube, why am I itchy right here?
[281:29.62]This goes in here.
[281:32.58]Out of the way, mouse.
[281:37.88]Get this.
[281:40.29]All the way in?
[281:40.73]Yeah, all the way in.
[281:42.03]Okay, that's in.
[281:55.27]Old man enjoys a... Why am I touching the mouse?
[281:57.65]Get the fuck out of here.
[281:58.91]It's the Wii mode.
[282:03.28]Box is sticking out.
[282:08.42]Yes, there it is.
[282:09.47]Sheet H. Sheet H. E, F. Gee, there's so many pieces here.
[282:27.20]H. Get the fuck away from me.
[282:37.85]H.
[282:39.65]So I need this piece right here.
[282:42.05]Just this one.
[282:42.85]Not the rest.
[282:46.55]Just this.
[282:50.47]The other thing below it.
[282:51.31]Okay, and the little dumbbell right here.
[282:55.07]Damn.
[282:57.84]I'm gonna use all these pieces.
[283:00.14]I'm gonna fuck this up, I swear to God.
[283:05.06]What's going on with my hand?
[283:05.84]Look at this.
[283:07.14]Look at this shit.
[283:08.51]It's, like, all red down there.
[283:09.51]Got, like, bit by a fucking mosquito.
[283:17.74]Got bit by a spider.
[283:18.68]I wouldn't be surprised.
[283:19.44]Alright.
[283:20.72]Our next job is to build the side lever.
[283:22.22]It's a little bit tricky, but you can do it.
[283:24.92]Thank you for having the confidence.
[283:27.99]In me.
[283:28.25]Appreciate it, Nintendo.
[283:32.65]So...
[283:34.45]With the printed side facing up, fold these two little flaps.
[283:37.99]They may be small, but they're pretty important.
[283:41.67]This is this.
[283:42.41]Look at that.
[283:45.29]And these two come up.
[283:58.34]Step is missed.
[283:59.18]I didn't fuck up anything.
[284:00.62]Give me a break.
[284:02.38]Flip it over.
[284:04.30]and fold it in half.
[284:12.01]Am I still here?
[284:12.79]Yes.
[284:12.99]What do you mean, am I still here?
[284:14.15]I'm sitting right here the whole time.
[284:18.13]So there's that.
[284:20.05]So that's folded.
[284:24.76]Make sure the piece is the right way up this time.
[284:27.52]We want the printed side down.
[284:31.10]So we're talking about this.
[284:34.06]Hold on, I gotta get this shit out of here.
[284:45.62]Like that.
[284:48.05]Okay.
[284:49.81]So what do I do with this?
[284:53.55]Fold it all up.
[284:57.39]Let me stop you there.
[285:01.37]Fold.
[285:03.24]Fold it.
[285:06.14]ban him who's been who am I banning who needs somebody gets like a band from the chat what do they do what happened I'm still on the piano I just started the piano like fucking two hours ago give me a break oh he's still on the piano you do it hey you do it let's see when you how far you get
[285:39.90]Okay, so then this comes down, with the flap still folded all the way over, slide the piece from before through the hole.
[285:47.11]So that goes all the way in.
[285:51.73]So this comes down like this, and then this goes in here.
[285:57.82]That's as far as it goes.
[286:08.09]Sticks out a little bit.
[286:10.69]Okay.
[286:12.09]Now what?
[286:16.71]Wrap the two sides around and fix them together with a tab.
[286:20.90]So this comes up and around.
[286:23.26]And this comes around as well.
[286:25.78]Makes a little compacted little tab here.
[286:29.83]And stick it in.
[286:30.83]There it is.
[286:41.75]Put the face game at the top corner.
[286:44.71]Like up here.
[286:51.03]Doesn't fuck anything up?
[286:56.74]One guy said that.
[286:59.96]Yeah, but is it true?
[287:01.54]Should it be like right there?
[287:06.98]Better?
[287:08.78]Better?
[287:09.52]Okay, that's better.
[287:16.67]I'm moving this down, look.
[287:20.05]I'm not gonna move.
[287:21.37]See where, I'm grabbing the pants right here.
[287:23.50]Moving it down.
[287:24.64]Relax.
[287:25.14]Okay.
[287:32.78]Back here.
[287:42.01]Done.
[287:42.95]Here it is.
[287:44.59]It's time to attach some marker stickers.
[287:46.62]You'll find them in the plastic bag.
[287:52.78]What the fuck?
[288:04.87]Start with the ones at the end of the sheet.
[289:13.94]The end of the sheet.
[289:23.82]Fuck are you talking about?
[289:54.50]Okay.
[289:54.92]Alright.
[289:55.58]Slow.
[289:55.94]Stop.
[289:56.26]Wait, wait, wait.
[290:33.48]He's so quiet and then That's right, that's correct, right
[291:03.47]I understand.
[291:04.69]Same thing on the other side.
[291:14.13]Look, to be honest, it's very hard to see.
[291:15.91]Look at this.
[291:18.42]You can't even tell where the ridges are.
[291:24.54]It's really hard to see this on here.
[291:27.06]You can barely make that out.
[291:30.14]Okay, same thing on the other side.
[291:35.85]Let's be quiet so I can get this correct.
[291:39.65]Old and blind.
[291:40.39]I got it.
[291:41.46]I'm good to go, man.
[291:47.23]Eat your Wheaties.
[291:47.93]Just relax.
[292:12.02]That's close enough.
[292:12.66]I don't give a fuck.
[292:20.22]That's good enough.
[292:22.22]Get out of my way.
[292:31.10]Lay this piece out, printed side down.
[292:39.65]Fucking idiot.
[292:40.39]Hold on.
[292:42.00]I'm gonna put all these on the table over here, because I'll lose them all.
[292:52.26]Okay, that's good.
[292:53.78]It looks like somebody just like shook me out of bed.
[292:59.82]Alright, so this piece has to go down, part of the side down.
[293:07.68]Like that.
[293:16.08]This one is pretty difficult.
[293:17.70]Even the little circles.
[293:18.86]That's so hard to get the circles out.
[293:21.38]To like punch about with a hole punch.
[293:29.61]Rat Movie 3 or Riot?
[293:32.27]You want me to make Rat Movie 3?
[293:34.31]Spend like 40 hours in 3D Movie Maker and make it right now?
[293:37.99]That ain't gonna happen.
[293:38.79]Sorry guys.
[293:39.25]Look at that.
[293:44.20]Okay.
[293:45.79]Increase the folds.
[293:47.73]Take a look.
[293:48.35]That's how you do it.
[293:53.71]Slow down.
[294:00.67]Rat Movie three, baby.
[294:03.58]Not today.
[294:05.10]Not tomorrow.
[294:06.96]Not next week.
[294:08.40]Sorry.
[294:09.90]Hate to burst all your bubbles.
[294:12.49]But that is not going to happen.
[294:19.01]Just wait till you hear the song I play for you.
[294:22.11]I'm going to blow you guys the fuck away.
[294:26.17]Just wait.
[294:26.99]You'll see.
[294:37.48]Bookworm Adventures?
[294:38.64]Why would I play that?
[294:40.52]What are you talking about?
[294:42.82]What is Bookworm Adventures?
[294:46.95]Sounds like a game I'll never play.
[294:48.05]Alright, you'll need a small rubber band from the plastic bag.
[294:52.17]Which one's a small rubber band?
[294:53.63]This looks pretty small.
[294:56.37]That's a little rubber band.
[294:59.11]Okay.
[295:01.38]Hook the rubber band around these two tabs that stick out, printed side facing down.
[295:08.92]The fuck?
[295:11.36]So like this?
[295:15.36]Like this.
[295:24.78]How is it supposed to go?
[295:25.56]Around one notch.
[295:29.58]The other notch.
[295:30.56]Okay.
[295:30.72]Just like this.
[295:34.58]Pick this up.
[295:37.22]Here and then here.
[295:39.30]Like that.
[295:42.56]Stick the lever right through the middle of the rubber band.
[295:49.58]Upside down, and then in.
[295:54.90]Upside down, and then in.
[296:02.14]That's in there.
[296:04.78]Fold it all up.
[296:08.99]Fold this over.
[296:13.08]Fold this over.
[296:16.69]Wait, wait, hold on.
[296:17.21]This is all fucked up.
[296:18.01]Do I have this the right way?
[296:22.15]It's going to be like this.
[296:29.74]Bands are on.
[296:35.18]This goes up over.
[296:38.40]Like this.
[296:40.70]Jesus Christ.
[296:41.54]Okay.
[296:42.02]And then this comes up and around and through.
[296:48.02]Get in there, you fucking little shit.
[296:51.23]Get in there.
[296:52.89]It's not in there.
[296:56.89]Alright, that's in there.
[297:01.21]And this comes up.
[297:02.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[297:03.91]Back up.
[297:05.83]That comes all the way around and then that goes on the top?
[297:09.46]Did I do it wrong?
[297:13.23]No, I got it right.
[297:14.01]Because that comes over and goes in.
[297:20.01]That's correct, right?
[297:20.81]No, I got it.
[297:23.90]Okay, I got it right.
[297:24.54]Just making sure I got it right.
[297:26.40]And then this goes in.
[297:31.04]Now let's attach the side level to the main body of the piano.
[297:36.14]So this goes down like this.
[297:40.80]Into here.
[297:42.66]The big pieces or the little pieces?
[297:44.68]The big slots.
[297:46.02]Turn the whole thing over and stick them through the other tabs.
[297:50.67]Okay, so go through the big ones.
[297:59.39]So those are in.
[298:02.53]But the whole... Wait, what about the... I guess not.
[298:06.72]Okay, the whole thing goes upside down.
[298:08.92]And this goes in here like this.
[298:13.41]This goes in here like this.
[298:18.02]Like that.
[298:23.38]Wrong side.
[298:24.28]I got it.
[298:25.38]I'm not losing it.
[298:26.04]I got it correct.
[298:30.22]Look, that's right.
[298:33.51]That's correct.
[298:36.35]I got it.
[298:40.51]Time to put the whole thing together.
[298:43.72]Back up.
[298:46.14]So this thing is like this.
[298:49.12]This is like this.
[298:50.62]This thing comes up like this.
[298:54.12]Okay.
[298:58.18]Got the tab here.
[299:03.88]In that slot.
[299:06.90]Okay, so the whole thing comes up into this slot.
[299:14.30]Like that.
[299:16.66]Alright, and then the whole thing, then it connects to the back here, right?
[299:21.72]One in there.
[299:25.53]Into this.
[299:26.29]I didn't fold this.
[299:27.33]Fucking idiot.
[299:30.15]You forgot to fold the part with the hole over.
[299:33.75]What?
[299:35.57]It's too late.
[299:36.09]Okay, that's in.
[299:41.80]Hydrate.
[299:42.28]You got it.
[299:48.51]top goes on right close the lid two tabs insert so this goes back up back up there's a little thing sticking out here these are all folded down fold it down fold it down fold it down fold it down
[300:20.69]And then the tabs come in.
[300:22.20]Tab here.
[300:24.42]Get that in there.
[300:30.14]Missing a fold?
[300:31.46]Did I fuck up a fold?
[300:32.40]Are you sure?
[300:36.42]Fold the bottom?
[300:37.40]Down, down, down.
[300:38.24]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[300:39.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[300:43.02]What are you talking about?
[300:47.79]What happened?
[300:48.23]What did I do wrong?
[300:50.86]Front the back they'll call circle back thing.
[300:59.84]Top part, top part, top part.
[301:10.14]Top right part.
[301:11.54]Hold on.
[301:14.34]Fold the holes together right here.
[301:28.65]Like this.
[301:33.79]That's what you, this?
[301:36.97]Okay, alright, I see it.
[301:40.34]Okay, I got it.
[301:41.68]Processed.
[301:43.42]Let's go back.
[301:50.82]Ah, fuck, you guys are right.
[301:52.06]Thank you for saving my life.
[301:54.40]Okay, whole thing goes together.
[301:56.67]Goes up and in.
[302:02.18]Like that.
[302:04.54]Okay.
[302:05.38]That's connected.
[302:06.98]Around the corner.
[302:07.72]That is in.
[302:15.10]The whole thing comes down into the hole and into this hole too.
[302:20.97]So this has to come out like that.
[302:23.15]And then in.
[302:28.57]Whew!
[302:30.75]Looks pretty good.
[302:33.07]So far.
[302:35.91]I owe this rat... You owe you... I owe you Rat Movie 3.
[302:38.97]And it takes like fucking 400 hours to make one of those.
[302:42.41]Maybe in like a fucking couple of years.
[302:44.61]Alright.
[302:44.97]Edge one by one.
[302:45.97]Close it up.
[302:46.47]That's what I did.
[302:48.99]Push that in.
[302:49.91]Connected this one.
[302:52.75]Snapped it.
[302:54.31]And then check that the lever is working properly.
[302:58.08]So this is the lever right here.
[303:02.20]Try sliding the lever up and down.
[303:03.82]If you can see the marker stickers poking out, that's perfect.
[303:12.00]I can.
[303:12.27]Sorry, it works.
[303:14.47]The rubber band isn't working, it's functioning.
[303:17.27]Goes up.
[303:18.43]I can see the marker.
[303:19.73]Alright, that's perfect.
[303:23.85]We're good.
[303:28.67]Fold it up.
[303:30.71]The main body is complete.
[303:35.64]Won't be long now.
[303:37.62]Great work.
[303:37.98]There's still a ways to go, but there's no need to rush.
[303:39.92]That was just part one.
[303:52.11]Making the keyboard tray.
[303:53.35]Get this out of my way.
[303:58.86]It's done.

[304:06.33]Alright, E and F. E and F. There's E, there's F. Okay, this is fucking huge.
[304:24.58]He won't get it later?
[304:26.80]Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay, I'll get it now.
[304:28.34]What are you referring to?
[304:30.19]What are you referring to on here?
[304:33.17]Tuck the flap.
[304:34.15]What flap?
[304:34.77]Where are you talking?
[304:35.39]What do you want me to do?
[304:39.06]Back left.
[304:42.74]This?
[305:02.56]We're all good.
[305:05.60]Chat saves me again.
[305:06.83]Yeah, we're fine.
[305:09.67]Alright, get the big thing out of the way.
[305:12.73]Alright, take out the big, huge section.
[305:15.19]It's just one piece, it's the whole piece of cardboard here.
[305:19.71]I'm proud of you, thank you.
[305:26.23]This is a big piece, it's only one piece, the whole thing, get it all.
[305:31.01]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[305:32.09]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[305:39.21]Jesus.
[305:42.10]It's a big guy, huh?
[305:46.28]Is it two pieces?
[305:47.00]Oh, I hope it is.
[305:49.20]Is it two pieces?
[305:50.24]I hope so.
[305:50.78]Yeah, it is.
[305:52.78]It's three pieces.
[305:56.02]It's more than that.
[305:57.76]Six and two.
[306:05.78]I didn't break it.
[306:06.58]Don't say that.
[306:07.34]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[306:07.76]Don't.
[306:09.94]This is done.
[306:11.52]I would throw it behind me, but we made that reference and there's no reference to be made.
[306:16.23]Shut up.
[306:17.43]Not you guys.
[306:18.73]Alright.
[306:19.27]Here we go.
[306:19.79]This is E and F. So these 1 and 2.
[306:22.29]This is the keyboard.
[306:23.43]Looks like these are the keys portion.
[306:27.59]That's cool.
[306:28.29]Alright.
[306:28.81]Get that out of there.
[306:30.92]Fuck out of there.
[306:31.82]Get a little fucking fast.
[306:35.20]This is going to get complicated, I guarantee it.
[306:37.78]Alright.
[306:38.66]Put that down.
[306:41.08]E and F. So we go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[306:48.95]That's enough.
[306:53.15]Here's a pro tip.
[306:53.79]Fast forward.
[306:54.41]I already know that.
[306:56.87]Okay.
[306:57.29]Start with a printed side facing down of
[307:00.30]this big piece here no don't punch out the middle apparently these sides need to go bottom no bottom doesn't go out either just the sides and this piece right here I'm building a piano this will eventually be a usable piano
[307:27.92]Should be interesting, should be fun to do.
[307:30.80]This piece comes out too.
[307:34.42]You're gonna keep folding your hog even if I ban you.
[307:38.73]Okay, well I'm not gonna ban you, so do whatever you want.
[307:41.55]I'm not gonna judge you.
[307:45.07]Wow, there are a lot of fold lines here, better crease them carefully, okay.
[307:49.52]Holy shit, look at this little one right here, all the way across.
[307:56.63]Am I really supposed to do that?
[307:59.21]Look at the top part.
[307:59.93]I have to fold this?
[308:03.23]That's gonna be so difficult.
[308:05.13]Hold on, let me just make sure I have to do that.
[308:08.18]Yeah, I do.
[308:08.86]Fuck, okay.
[308:10.98]Freeze it extra carefully.
[308:13.66]Jesus.
[308:16.44]This is so thin.
[308:26.83]Almost.
[308:29.89]Damn.
[308:31.89]Damn.
[308:33.47]You are not making this easy.
[308:35.09]Damn.
[308:40.04]Come here.
[308:51.18]Get over here, you little fuck.
[308:53.01]I tried to get him to land on me.
[308:54.09]It was a bug.
[308:59.10]So that's, okay.
[309:04.28]That's as good as it's gonna get, seriously.
[309:05.68]Not gonna be better than that.
[309:07.96]Okay, fold the next couple pieces.
[309:14.64]That one was hard, seriously.
[309:15.96]It's not easy to do that.
[309:21.87]Have I broken?
[309:22.89]No, I have not broken anything.
[309:26.97]we got through the jokes in the first 40 minutes of the stream now I'm actually playing the game because I'm very interested that one then the bigger one fold it all the way game that's this is a game how is this not a game this is a game it is how is this not a video game
[309:58.49]800 viewers gone in the last hour.
[310:01.35]I can tell you why that is.
[310:03.01]Because it's midnight Eastern time.
[310:06.53]People gotta go to bed, man.
[310:09.28]EU viewers?
[310:11.08]It's like 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.
[310:13.76]That's not out of the ordinary.
[310:16.42]But hey, thanks for sticking around.
[310:20.30]That's an excuse?
[310:21.16]No, that's reality, man.
[310:23.38]It's like 5am for a lot of viewers right now.
[310:27.07]Whatever helps you sleep at night, right guys?
[310:31.84]Plus you're watching him fold boxes because you're probably, you're going to fall asleep.
[310:36.06]This is a fall asleep stream.
[310:37.80]I can, I'm okay with that.
[310:39.66]That's fine.
[310:41.42]Look, not everything has to be like an intense, crazy fucking stream.
[310:45.96]Sometimes we're just going to fold cardboard for the whole stream.
[310:51.54]Sometimes we're just going to do this for six hours.
[311:00.31]That looks good, right?
[311:02.05]I did all the major folds?
[311:04.73]I did.
[311:05.63]Except for this one.
[311:06.21]I did this one too.
[311:07.25]Remember when you played that fishing game?
[311:12.19]Just wait till I play you a real song on the piano and you fucking lose your mind.
[311:15.49]Fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, okay.
[311:22.98]I'll do this.
[311:23.60]Ooh, this little round tab needs to be creased, does it now?
[311:35.54]My hair looks like a mustache
[312:04.16]Okay, hold on.
[312:04.64]Wait, wait, wait.
[312:06.42]I'm so insecure.
[312:07.44]I don't like having the... You guys know I don't do facecam.
[312:11.18]I don't like it.
[312:13.18]I don't like... You can see my fucking greasy hair the whole time.
[312:16.29]Am I going to shave my head?
[312:20.79]No.
[312:21.57]You know how bad I look with a bald head?
[312:24.07]I look terrible.
[312:27.53]You do it so much, though.
[312:31.09]I don't, when do I do facecam?
[312:33.29]I do facecam like seven times a year.
[312:35.98]Alright, I gotta see this.
[312:43.40]So this is up, up, and then over.
[312:47.10]Like that.
[312:48.72]This.
[312:54.25]Seven, yeah, seven.
[312:58.73]You gonna see my face more often?
[313:03.55]I mean, it makes sense for stuff like that.
[313:04.77]I'm building shit with cardboard.
[313:06.97]Makes sense.
[313:07.97]So then this comes around that.
[313:12.03]So this goes up and then around this.
[313:15.01]And then in there, so that piece is done on the side.
[313:20.82]Same thing on the other side, okay.
[313:26.85]pretty good okay tab comes down bring it downtown the short hair makes me look way younger and more handsome it's just laziness man it really is it's not like I'm concerned about it I just I just need to get a haircut and I just don't do it
[313:55.68]my hair haircut is at the bottom of the list of important that I need to do but thank you though I appreciate it I could care less like if I look like whatever unless sometimes you look like don't matter what are you gonna do I'm gonna put a bunch of makeup on stream no uh Christopher lines so wait a minute which one the book piece is this no that's stupid
[314:27.07]It's the one with the nubs, but they both have nubs.
[314:30.31]This one is branded, though.
[314:31.86]It's not this one.
[314:32.56]This one's branded.
[314:33.26]So like that.
[314:38.02]It's got a square in the end.
[314:39.10]Yes, it does.
[314:43.10]Fold everything like you typically would in this game, right?
[314:52.26]Oh, this one's tough.
[314:54.13]Ugh.
[314:56.40]Show my package on stream.
[314:59.66]No, I'll get banned for life.
[315:02.32]It's not worth it.
[315:03.65]Alright, if you give me $10 million, I'll do it.
[315:08.81]If you give me right now $10 million, I'll do it in 30 days so you can't charge it back.
[315:27.14]Let me retire, like, right now.
[315:30.94]Then it becomes worth it.
[315:32.42]Not at the moment, though.
[315:35.74]Start a GoFundMe.
[315:38.30]Jesus Christ.
[315:39.83]Alright, this is good.
[315:45.85]I'm still going?
[315:46.53]Of course I am.
[315:47.23]I'm having a blast.
[315:47.97]This is great.
[315:49.29]I'm having a great fucking time right now.
[315:54.85]Bezos, please.
[315:57.20]Alright, so this goes around like this.
[316:00.24]Like that.
[316:04.44]And then, where the fuck is this going?
[316:06.09]So this goes in here.
[316:10.55]This tab right here.
[316:11.89]Let me see it before I do it.
[316:15.45]Carefully, one at a time, we'll start with the left side.
[316:17.35]And then the right side goes down.
[316:19.59]Okay, I got it.
[316:22.16]So in like this.
[316:25.79]Nice little snap.
[316:27.69]And down into here.
[316:35.03]Okay, that's in.
[316:38.41]Looking good.
[316:39.84]And now the right side, watch out, it's a little different.
[316:41.60]Yeah, I got it.
[316:45.56]Make sure the round tab from before is sticking up against the back.
[317:20.40]There we go.
[317:22.64]Alright, it's up now.
[317:23.82]Let's get it back in.
[317:27.08]Fold you down and the piano in.
[317:32.05]Get around the corner.
[317:33.11]Alright, there we go.
[317:34.01]That's better.
[317:36.13]See?
[317:37.53]Okay.
[317:45.37]For those of you asleep, you ain't asleep anymore.
[317:49.93]Now for this piece, make sure you got the right one.
[317:53.21]There's another one that looks like that, but it's not that one.
[317:55.67]It's this one.
[318:00.57]Now wake up.
[318:03.64]Place the printed side down and fold it firmly over.
[318:14.08]I can do this in two hours.
[318:16.22]That's been like an hour and a half.
[318:18.21]It's been like one hour.
[318:19.65]Give me a break.
[318:20.17]Okay, and then it stands up and spins around like this.
[318:29.68]Like that, right?
[318:32.78]Slide it into the slots on the sides of the box.
[318:34.80]Have you got it the right way?
[318:54.32]into the slots there.
[318:56.78]So right here.
[319:00.77]Right there.
[319:05.69]That's in there, right?
[319:07.97]Facing the right way.
[319:12.33]This piece folds in the opposite direction, so crease it with the printed side up.
[319:17.78]Okay, so printed side up, which is like this.
[319:21.34]Printed side up.
[319:22.84]Wait, go back, you fucking... This goes like this.
[319:30.30]Like that.
[319:38.60]Should've bought a piano on Craigslist.
[319:40.87]Yeah, they're like nine grand.
[319:42.37]In case you were wondering.
[319:46.05]Then set it up like that.
[319:47.65]Face up.
[319:50.23]And that sticks.
[319:52.64]slide it in the same slot goes in the same hold on go back so this goes you it up you idiot okay that's fine so this goes like this here's the front so this goes like this down here facing the back in the same place
[320:25.01]That's correct, right?
[320:27.79]Looks correct to me.
[320:28.53]And then in comes time for some more marker stickers.
[320:38.90]We'll use the same sheet we used before.
[320:44.95]So this is the fat stickers.
[320:46.47]I can't even tell.
[320:47.21]Okay.
[320:48.81]First of all, this is not this one, it's this one.
[320:52.22]Move this out of the way.
[320:53.14]This piece right here.
[320:59.04]So you need to put one sticker here.
[321:01.19]Okay.
[321:06.01]Right on the end.
[321:07.19]It shouldn't be too difficult.
[321:18.34]Looks good.
[321:20.08]Same thing on the other side, right?
[321:21.18]Right there.
[321:25.75]Black printed side of the sheet.
[321:27.07]Make sure you get the position right.
[321:30.21]Same thing on the other side.
[321:31.15]Okay.
[321:37.36]I lost him.
[321:37.84]Right here.
[321:45.72]I fucked up!
[321:55.53]Alright, one, two.
[321:58.25]I don't need any more stickers.
[322:04.43]That looks good, right?
[322:07.95]Fold all the creases.
[322:11.45]Make the piano stand out like some of its friends.
[322:18.00]It's like fucking 12 o'clock at night, man.
[322:20.74]I can't make any good references right now.
[322:22.12]It's not gonna happen.
[322:24.62]been drinking shitty wine and like whiskey didn't even see the whiskey I've been lying to you the whole stream alright so that looks good any more pieces that folds up these little nubs need to come in like that looks good Jim beans no no no Johnny Walker
[322:54.98]Don't drink anything but Johnny Walker.
[322:56.32]That's gross.
[322:59.38]So this comes up and out like this.
[323:02.74]Yeah, drink Johnny Walker.
[323:03.80]Don't drink other whiskeys.
[323:04.90]Don't be a fucking pleb.
[323:06.22]So then this comes down.
[323:11.88]Alright, I can see it.
[323:21.22]Hmm, interesting.
[323:23.01]Stand the box up.
[323:26.22]Like this.
[323:28.24]No, wait, hold on.
[323:31.76]Okay, no, I got it right.
[323:32.54]Like that, and then like this.
[323:40.51]Jim Bean?
[323:43.11]I don't like Jim Bean.
[323:45.01]So this goes, join this piece onto the box, insert the tabs into the slots.
[323:51.35]There are two tabs.
[323:53.93]I see them.
[323:54.27]We're on the edge here.
[323:58.64]This goes up like this and around the corners.
[324:02.31]Into here.
[324:04.83]Into here.
[324:06.37]Okay.
[324:07.53]So that's in.
[324:11.27]Drinking Jim Bean right now.
[324:13.23]Jim Bean's fine.
[324:15.07]I prefer Johnny Walker, though.
[324:18.24]It's my favorite whiskey.
[324:19.40]Johnny Walker Blue.
[324:21.40]It's expensive.
[324:22.22]I didn't have that tonight, but... Okay, so then this comes down.
[324:26.42]Is this in there?
[324:28.00]Kind of.
[324:31.12]still making this yeah I mean it takes a while it takes a long time to get this done time for the final bit of this step first fold the two tabs to the standing up so this is this one I honestly never had Johnny give it a try it's good Johnny Walker black is cheap and fine I think it tastes better than Jack and Jim bean and John it's Jameson I think it's better than all of them
[324:58.63]Alright, so this is this this goes here Both tabs come up Yeah, Johnny Walker blue is my favorite alcohol by a thousand leagues If I ever have a chance to drink it, I will drink it but it's very expensive
[325:27.89]It's too expensive.
[325:28.81]Okay, this goes... Insert both tabs into this slot.
[325:33.95]Make sure the printed marks the right way.
[325:36.15]Yeah, there.
[325:41.61]Looks correct.
[325:43.61]Correct enough.
[325:48.03]And here we go.
[325:50.77]Oh!
[325:51.61]Fuck you.
[325:52.17]Did I mess it up?
[325:52.83]No.
[325:55.29]So the tabs should be facing in, right?
[325:57.51]Right there.
[326:00.25]Did you just wipe off your sweat with that piece?
[326:02.03]Yeah, probably.
[326:03.55]I wouldn't be surprised if I did.
[326:06.68]Coming along pretty well.
[326:09.12]Alcohol extreme?
[326:10.12]No, I drink like eight times a year, guys.
[326:12.44]Come on.
[326:14.48]So then, what's that?
[326:17.07]Nintendo Labo, right?
[326:18.61]That's correct.
[326:20.79]Done.
[326:22.50]alright now I stick now we can join the whole thing to the main body of the piano fold that tab at the front of the base let's get this over here I don't really I don't like any of the vodkas or gins or whiskeys I'm not a fan of really anything like oh drink gray goose I don't really like it I think it's kind of gross
[326:52.00]I drink eight days a week.
[326:54.08]That sounds kind of insane.
[326:58.12]This tab comes up here.
[327:01.64]You don't like whiskey?
[327:03.48]Yeah, I mean, if you don't like whiskey, then just my other go-to is cider.
[327:08.45]I love cider.
[327:09.53]Hard cider is so good.
[327:11.51]It's hard to drink all the time, though.
[327:14.77]Colitis just fucks me up so bad if I want to drink.
[327:18.11]I'm okay.
[327:18.75]If I drink like once a month, I'm usually okay.
[327:22.50]More than that, no way, it's not gonna happen.
[327:24.16]Alright, slide the keyboard in.
[327:26.38]Let's just look at that.
[327:29.78]So this tab in here.
[327:33.20]Is that the tabs that go in?
[327:35.64]Check these out.
[327:38.56]Pass the whiskey.
[327:39.82]Yeah, sometimes.
[327:43.42]Is that in?
[327:43.86]Okay, that's in.
[327:48.37]That is in.
[327:50.23]What's the next step?
[327:53.04]Is it?
[327:53.62]Keyboard tray is complete.
[327:56.42]This is coming along.
[327:58.26]We're halfway there.
[327:59.50]I gotta make the keyboard now.
[328:02.14]There are 13 keys to make.
[328:05.44]So this part might take a while.
[328:11.44]Hardcore folding.
[328:12.62]Oy vey.
[328:15.03]Alright, get this away from me.
[328:21.43]Five parts from F.
[328:24.94]So this is one, two, three, four, five.
[328:29.84]That's it for now.
[328:37.56]Because the first two parts went so fast.
[328:42.23]Yeah, they went by, they blazed by.
[328:44.43]I don't know about you guys, but I've said this like three times now and I said I wasn't going to repeat.
[328:52.17]I'm not going to repeat myself.
[328:53.79]I'm not going to say it.
[328:57.15]I'm not going to say it.
[328:57.69]I said I wasn't going to repeat.
[329:02.09]You know what I was going to say, though.
[329:09.80]Will he say it?
[329:12.50]Say it.
[329:16.89]How can I reword this?
[329:19.09]Can I reword this?
[329:25.11]Without saying it again?
[329:26.79]Probably not.
[329:32.57]It's... Come on.
[329:33.59]Don't give me that shit.
[329:35.43]You know you love the smell of fresh wooden cardboard.
[329:37.79]Don't tell me you don't.
[329:40.01]That's it?
[329:42.13]First, we'll put together the five black keys.
[329:44.27]They're all exactly the same.
[329:45.39]Okay.
[329:47.19]You don't like the smell of fresh wood?
[329:50.42]I don't know you at all, then.
[329:51.38]Okay.
[329:51.86]That's fine.
[329:53.90]Alright, let's lay them up.
[329:58.17]One, two, three, four, five.
[330:08.93]That stuff sucks.
[330:12.25]Hey, Johnny Walker, do you want to sponsor me?

[330:24.35]Jesus.
[330:26.77]Yeah, sure!
[330:27.53]Alright.
[330:29.20]Lay out the piece with the print side face down and crease those fold lines.
[330:32.08]Okay, so like this.
[330:35.40]Uh, now I understand what they mean.
[330:36.98]Look at that.
[330:38.00]Look at these tiny little folds.

[330:54.42]Listen, I don't have kids awake.
[330:57.40]It's the summer?
[330:59.16]That doesn't matter.
[331:00.84]Most kids go to bed at like fucking 10 o'clock.
[331:04.35]Alright, say me if you're under the age of 16.
[331:14.89]Liars.

[333:16.59]Someone used to tell Jerma that tying your hair too tight will make you lose hair.
[333:21.23]This is pretty, this is loose as all hell.
[333:23.87]That's not that tight.
[333:25.19]I don't put hair ties in my hair just for like a funny LOL, L-U-L funny meme stream.
[333:30.44]You know what I'm saying?
[333:31.80]Alright, so that's all folded.

[334:39.38]There that goes.
[334:44.02]And this folds in.
[334:46.58]Does it fold inside completely?
[334:48.12]Yeah, it does.
[334:51.35]Fold it in here.
[334:52.51]Like this.
[334:58.17]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[334:58.85]I need to put a marker sticker on the back.
[335:01.21]Make sure you get it in the right place.
[335:04.88]Where did that go?
[335:11.82]Streamer shows a little too much of his crack.
[335:17.69]Crack addiction.
[335:20.07]I don't do crack.
[335:21.03]What are you talking about?
[335:25.23]It's down here.
[335:26.82]Okay, it's one of these little pieces.
[335:33.72]Alright, where does this go?
[335:40.09]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[335:43.69]Slow down.
[335:44.29]So that goes here.
[335:49.00]Right on the front?
[335:50.78]Oh, this is gonna take some precision.
[336:02.97]I blew it, hold on.
[336:20.53]My hands are so fucking greasy.
[336:30.14]That's fine.
[336:30.78]There we go.
[336:31.54]Looks good.
[336:37.62]Okay, that's good.
[336:40.45]So that's done.
[336:41.21]So this piece is done.
[336:44.08]So now this goes into the piano.
[336:46.24]Now slide the key carefully into the keyboard tray.
[336:48.80]It fits right on top of those little black teeth that stick up.
[336:52.25]Like this.
[337:32.13]Like that?
[337:32.63]It sits down in there.
[337:39.21]It just sits in there.
[337:41.27]I guess.
[337:54.87]It doesn't feel that secure, but I guess so.
[338:04.70]Let's open the piano lid and see how everything looks from behind.
[338:07.33]Okay.
[338:18.68]Try pressing the key.
[338:22.76]If you see the marker sticker popping up, it's perfect.
[338:30.49]It is.
[338:47.45]I mean, that's close enough, right?
[338:51.21]It's not ruined, it's close enough.
[338:53.55]There.
[339:01.66]See?
[339:03.26]See, you can see the sticker going up and down.
[339:14.48]I mean, it looks alright, I guess.
[339:18.02]It's fine.
[339:18.40]Yeah, that works.
[339:19.74]Yeah, that's fine.
[339:22.52]Close it up.
[339:29.69]The next four keys are exactly the same.
[339:31.55]Ready to make them all.
[339:32.47]Jesus Christ.
[339:41.21]Same fucking thing.
[339:42.09]Fold it all up.

[343:19.03]I don't want to be worried about my nose hair situation.
[343:24.15]Which, by the way, it's definitely not that bad because I just did it not that long ago.
[343:27.99]Alright, close this up.
[343:30.61]Same deal.
[343:31.19]So this has to be like this.
[343:34.64]Fold it over.
[343:35.36]Fold it over like that.
[343:40.74]Stick it in.
[343:44.18]And then this goes down into there.
[343:46.54]There.
[343:48.51]I don't want to rush it, but I've got a pretty good system here going.
[343:52.47]It goes down like this.

[345:24.20]This is very interesting to me.
[345:26.74]We have to get the piano done at least.
[345:28.24]It's a little haggard looking, but that's okay.
[345:29.66]We'll fix it.

[351:53.10]That's a lie?
[351:53.68]What do you mean that's a lie?
[351:54.76]This is... I don't want to break it.
[351:58.10]The piano is not the one to fuck around and break.
[352:00.75]Okay?
[352:03.45]Give me a break.
[352:04.35]The piano is not the one to break.

[352:12.60]I'll break the fucking RC car for all I care.
[352:15.32]Not the piano.
[352:23.52]This is way more elaborate than the black keys, though.
[352:25.98]This is kind of all over the place.
[352:28.58]Put this down.
[352:29.20]Okay, there we go.
[352:30.06]Looks good.
[352:35.50]Okay, that's been folded, folded, folded, folded.
[352:42.43]Everything's been folded.
[352:43.29]Alright, so how do I assemble this?
[352:46.17]Okay.
[352:51.56]Alright, so this goes up from the bottom here.
[352:53.92]A little cube.
[352:56.39]This goes up.
[352:59.21]Then down into here.
[353:01.83]Ugh!
[353:02.73]Like this.
[353:11.67]Close the doors one at a time.
[353:17.83]Wrap the big long tab over them.
[353:21.93]Big long tab.
[353:22.95]How the fuck do you do this?
[353:26.51]Close it down?
[353:28.41]Jesus Christ.
[353:29.19]Okay, so this is gonna be tricky.
[353:31.17]Okay, so here, up and around.
[353:36.07]Like that.
[353:40.32]And then fold this piece up.
[353:43.52]Like this.
[353:46.90]Okay.
[353:48.76]Like that.
[353:50.66]Now what?
[353:52.56]This piece goes down.
[353:53.64]And up.
[353:56.18]And this one goes flat.
[354:00.96]Like this.
[354:06.25]Can you see the little tooth peeking through the hole?
[354:10.11]Yes, I can.
[354:11.53]Can you?
[354:16.09]Now we're gonna close up the back end.
[354:17.94]Watch the video carefully.
[354:19.06]Okay, so...
[354:24.57]Close the front piece down.
[354:26.37]And then this piece comes in the tab.
[354:36.64]Flip it around.
[354:40.00]This tail at the back is going to work as a kind of spring.
[354:42.93]Fold it over and leave it standing up like this.
[354:48.99]Like this.
[354:51.55]OK.
[354:54.35]Now get a marker sticker ready.
[354:55.67]Watch the video carefully.
[354:56.69]So where does it go?
[355:01.00]Right in the middle?
[355:05.42]Right in the middle here.
[355:07.30]Okay.
[355:09.80]So like right there.
[355:10.76]It's shaky fucking hands, man.
[355:24.05]Not good enough.
[355:25.15]Not good enough.
[355:26.75]Not good enough.
[355:29.89]That's passable.
[355:30.73]Okay, that's passable.
[355:33.49]It's kind of shitty, but it's passable.
[355:34.81]Alright.
[355:36.07]Right underneath the tail.
[355:38.17]How does this go in?
[355:40.89]With the tail still pointing forward, slide the key into this end of the keyboard.
[355:45.20]I gotta see this.
[355:49.64]Hold on.
[355:51.84]Fucking shit!
[356:09.88]back is not gonna work why do I think a bag is gonna do this do I need this I need this is a little one okay keep that over there

[357:08.14]Don't worry.
[357:08.72]Calm down.
[357:11.10]Just get this shit out of the way.
[357:20.83]Didn't touch the switch, right?
[357:22.95]I'll be right back.
[357:41.90]Alright, we're fine.
[357:43.94]Don't worry, we're good.
[357:47.80]Nice towel.
[357:48.42]It's a watermelon towel.
[357:49.56]It's a beach towel.
[357:50.62]Get over it.
[357:51.08]Alright, we're fine.
[358:02.71]Didn't even come close to the switch.
[358:04.47]We're fucking golden.
[358:05.63]Fuck off video games, right?
[358:15.03]hey how are you guys nice to see you welcome to the stream okay so how's this going like this all the way at the end and stick the tongue down so it kind of just sits in there huh

[358:45.75]Like that.
[358:57.41]I mean, that works.
[359:00.31]Yeah, that works.
[359:05.80]Sheet C. Just drag.
[359:37.09]Sheet C. Hydrate.
[359:43.39]I just did.
[359:43.87]Alright, I got like six more keys to bake.
[359:49.13]Speedrun.
[359:58.64]These two pieces.
[359:59.84]There's nothing else on C, right?
[360:02.72]That's it for C. Let's go forward.
[360:06.76]Slightly different shape than the last one.
[360:08.33]Make them in the right... We'll make them one right after the other.
[360:12.43]Are they different shape?
[360:16.67]I guess a little bit.
[360:19.55]Spider on microphone?
[360:20.61]Oh, fuck it.
[360:20.95]Who cares?
[360:21.47]Let them live.
[360:21.87]Alright.
[360:24.23]Let's fold these.
[360:24.81]That's it, right?
[360:31.55]Look at all these little folds.
[360:32.74]Goddamn.
[360:38.99]Let's try to get this done quick.
[360:41.57]There are so many little folds.
[360:47.93]There we are.
[360:49.99]Two, three, four, five, six.
[360:57.20]Jesus Christ, these are different.
[361:00.28]Oh, Jesus.
[361:03.34]There.
[361:05.89]Bring these up.
[361:06.45]Is this?
[361:07.23]Yeah, this has to stay there.
[361:09.65]Up.
[361:10.81]In.
[361:11.01]I think these are separate.
[361:14.67]Maybe a little bit.
[361:18.37]Term of Frank?
[361:19.11]What do you mean Frank?
[361:20.87]What are you talking about?
[361:22.53]Term of Frank.
[361:23.19]I ripped this.
[361:24.45]No, I didn't.
[361:24.99]Good.
[361:25.79]We're fine.
[361:27.23]Alright, that's it for this.
[361:30.15]So now, what's the game plan after that?
[361:31.95]These are a little bit bigger, right?
[361:37.53]I think so.
[361:38.01]There's a spider in the chat.
[361:42.52]Fucking swat him.
[361:45.46]Okay, so this piece comes up like this.
[361:48.66]So does this.
[361:49.28]This goes into here.
[361:51.12]Okay.
[361:56.93]This has to be flat.
[361:59.11]Good.
[362:01.11]Comes down and then, hold on a second.
[362:03.83]Left side comes up and folds in first.
[362:07.57]left side up fold fold up alright okay bend it backwards a little bit and again push that down to the bottom this these both together come here you little come on so it's down that looks good
[362:39.11]I can see the little nub right here.
[362:40.81]Yes, I can.
[362:44.87]So now I'll close the back ends, and we're facing the right way.
[362:48.52]Top goes down, and then this next part folds in.
[362:51.50]Like that.
[362:57.86]Done.
[362:58.40]Okay.
[363:00.28]Flip it upside down.
[363:02.46]Fold this piece back.
[363:04.04]Done.
[363:08.79]Little tag right on the front.
[363:11.81]Easy peasy, get it done.
[363:13.65]Look at that.
[363:14.95]Stick it on there.
[363:18.12]Right on the middle.
[363:22.46]Close enough.
[363:24.48]Right in the middle, looks good.
[363:26.60]And this is going in.
[363:29.97]Let's make the other one the same way.
[363:31.19]Okay, let's get this done quick.

[364:35.17]Germany, expensive.
[364:36.03]Yeah, it exists.
[364:36.67]You don't have to buy it if you don't want to.
[364:40.57]There is no reason to own the $25 emote.
[364:43.95]There is none.
[364:44.93]There is not a single fucking reason in the world.
[364:48.11]It's only for the people that feel like buying it.
[364:51.01]I can't stop you.
[364:51.89]It's just there.
[364:52.39]Alright, fold it up.
[365:03.07]So this part comes up.

[365:47.82]Get that fucking shit done quick.
[365:50.56]Fold it up right there, stick a fucking sticker on it.
[365:59.51]I'm doing this pretty quick, I am.
[366:05.87]You can choose not to believe it, but believe it.
[366:12.95]Got one more to do, right?
[366:16.85]Okay, now with the tail spring bent forward, slide these keys in.
[366:20.09]Something like this, let's get it up here.
[366:30.76]Okay, so we got one.
[366:32.74]Slide it in this way.
[366:33.52]They're both the same thing, so just slide it in, right?
[366:37.50]Slide it in there.
[366:40.85]This.
[366:46.17]Okay, next one goes in.
[366:49.09]Oh, this one goes over here.
[366:50.11]Okay, hold on.
[366:51.57]This goes to the right of this one.
[366:59.53]These ones aren't really... They're not on there that well.
[367:11.63]Okay, that's in.
[367:20.24]We're getting, it's almost, we're getting there, it's close.
[367:24.16]Sheet A. Those two at the bottom left, you got it.
[367:31.74]Let's get it out quick.
[367:42.41]It's fairly functional right now.
[367:45.05]We'll see in like another 30 minutes how much further we're going.
[367:48.99]Get out of the way.
[367:49.83]Okay, let's go.
[367:57.74]These two keys are pretty similar to the last two.
[367:59.32]We'll make them right after one another.
[368:00.60]Yeah, let's go.
[368:03.06]Just fold them all up.
[368:09.40]I think it's the key next to the right one that's messed up.
[368:12.35]I'll fix it.
[368:13.19]Don't worry.
[368:13.57]We'll be good to go.
[368:14.19]There we go.
[368:22.33]Good, good, good.
[368:23.09]Fold that.
[368:25.31]Get rid of the little nub in the middle.
[368:27.48]Get out of here.
[368:31.62]Yeah, every problem can be fixed.
[368:35.46]Don't worry about that.
[368:36.26]I'll fix it.
[368:36.88]I'll figure it out.
[368:41.14]You don't think I'm a master of intelligence here?
[368:44.93]I've got a 7,000 fucking million IQ.
[368:49.81]It's been tested before.
[368:50.81]Okay, looks good.
[369:00.39]Alright, now roll up the sides.
[369:02.49]Make sure I'm going the right way.
[369:04.63]It's a little different.
[369:05.75]This one's not that different at all, actually.
[369:08.39]Stick that in.
[369:11.12]Looks pretty good.
[369:11.86]We got up, right, left.
[369:16.50]Up, right, left.
[369:20.24]Put this little nut through the hole here.
[369:24.03]Hold it there, there we go.
[369:28.51]Dot.
[369:29.41]Spin it around.
[369:30.01]Yep.
[369:34.65]Top right.
[369:44.63]It's in.
[369:46.27]Flip it around.
[369:47.21]Look at that.
[369:49.25]Stick the fucking tongue in the air.
[369:51.69]And that one's done.
[369:52.49]Do it again.
[369:52.97]This one.
[369:53.95]Good.
[369:54.11]I need a sticker.
[369:55.01]Fuck.
[370:01.12]Now I see why you guys want me to do the piano.
[370:02.60]This is going to be like a fucking 12 hour stream.
[370:04.30]That's good.
[370:14.11]done same thing do it again uh let's make the other one the way you're going to be so good at cardboard piano keys when you're done thank you appreciate that dude almost there fold fold fold fold fold
[370:38.80]You said I could do it in two... How many hours has it been?
[370:41.04]Has it been two hours?
[370:42.45]Have I failed my mission?
[370:46.79]I may have already failed.
[370:52.63]Has it been two hours?
[370:53.33]I'm not sure it's been two hours.
[370:56.39]It's been two hours and ten minutes?
[370:57.62]Oh, fuck it, whatever.
[371:00.52]Oh well, I lose.
[371:04.02]I lose.
[371:05.50]Sometimes you lose.
[371:07.80]It's all good.
[371:09.79]I got to be careful here.
[371:10.55]I don't want to do this too fast.
[371:12.05]I feel like I'm going to fucking break it.
[371:15.50]Oh, this is pretty mundane, isn't it?
[371:17.04]That's good.
[371:19.78]Fold this one more time.
[371:22.92]What is the white stuff on the desk at the bottom left?
[371:28.69]Where?
[371:29.61]Here.
[371:31.67]This is tape.
[371:34.75]This is some kind of tape.
[371:40.54]Can't get it off me now.
[371:44.21]This is so sticky.
[371:45.05]I don't know why I just grabbed that.
[371:46.31]Alright, fold it up.
[371:57.61]Fold, fold, fold.
[371:59.10]In you go.

[372:15.42]I touched that sticky ass shit.
[372:17.00]Now I can't do anything.
[372:19.52]It's fine.
[372:21.42]It's good.
[372:22.98]Spin it.
[372:26.31]Top and then in, in, up here, fold it back, get a sticker.
[372:37.26]Not very many more to do.
[372:46.95]Am I sticking them, am I putting them in, or am I gonna leave them off?
[372:53.71]Is it going in?
[372:54.35]Okay, so this one's going right next to this one.
[372:56.23]Okay, this one's fucked up a little bit, but it's okay.
[373:08.28]Alright, so this one is going here, right next to this one.
[373:21.87]Okay, what about the other one?
[373:25.50]Going all the way to the left.
[373:28.94]There it goes.
[373:29.68]So all the way over here.
[373:34.50]Somebody just gave a lot of money.
[373:35.40]Hold on.
[373:38.54]Somebody gave like a fucking hundred bucks.
[373:39.86]Hold on a second.
[373:44.26]More than that.
[373:47.00]Thank you, Shawnee Noodles, for the $50.
[373:51.12]Thank you so much, man.
[373:51.96]50 bucks from Shawnee Noodles.
[373:53.52]Hey, guy, this is a lot less than I owe you for the years of entertainment, but you helped me through some dark times where a laugh meant everything.
[374:01.23]I work in corrections and want to give a shout out to everyone in corrections and law enforcement who risk their lives to do the job they do every day.
[374:11.45]Love you now, and I love you when you're bald.
[374:14.05]Don't worry about it.
[374:17.07]Thank you so much, man.
[374:19.32]Yeah, much love to all those in corrections.
[374:22.44]Those that keep us safe.
[374:24.90]Thank you.
[374:26.92]And thank you.
[374:28.08]Shawnee Noodles.
[374:30.03]Shawnee Noodles, $50 from you.
[374:32.73]And then right after that... He was talking about the prisoners?
[374:37.47]What do you mean talking about prisoners?
[374:42.03]Holy shit, the stream?
[374:42.71]Yeah, the stream's still going, man.
[374:44.19]I gotta finish the piano!
[374:46.15]I have to beat the piano level.
[374:49.64]Edgemont, thank you for the hundred fucking dollars, Edgemont.
[374:53.39]Hey, Jerma, it's been a while.
[374:54.29]I've been occupied with a bunch of work-related stuff.
[374:56.95]So, sadly, I missed out on your streams.
[374:59.85]Luckily, there's the stream highlights on second Jerma.
[375:03.29]So, kudos to Holy Mac, and I guess you have another editor recently, Effector.
[375:09.33]Effectator.
[375:11.01]He's also very good.
[375:13.71]Keep me entertained, and in the meantime, anyways, don't mess up the piano.
[375:18.79]I was going to smash it.
[375:20.85]No, not right now.
[375:22.47]That would be a fucking stupid joke right now.
[375:25.77]Thank you both for the fucking $100 and the $50 respectively.
[375:28.25]Thank you so much, guys.
[375:31.13]That means a lot.
[375:33.65]Thank you.
[375:37.34]$150.
[375:37.74]This is the most work I've done so far.
[375:39.68]I'm not going to smash it.
[375:42.63]I wanna play the piano, right?
[375:46.14]It's gonna work, it's gonna be a functioning piano.
[375:48.30]Let's go.
[375:49.50]Thank you guys so much, really.
[375:51.66]Spider, top left.
[375:52.52]Got it.
[375:54.80]Three pieces from A. One, two, three, this is the end.
[376:00.43]These are the last three keys.
[376:03.29]One, two, three.
[376:14.64]Three, just this left side, that's it?
[376:19.70]Okay.
[376:21.12]I guess we're not quite done.
[376:24.83]That's it.
[376:25.17]Okay.
[376:27.51]Put that back.
[376:31.59]Just these three pieces, that's it.
[376:35.45]This key is different from all the other ones we've made so far.
[376:38.15]It's made of three separate parts.
[376:40.71]Plot twist!
[376:42.59]Don't put that up there, it's sticky.
[376:50.39]Okay, so this flips around Do the same thing we're doing folded why the three pieces to this one Spider is haunting from the left fucking who cares Step on it.
[377:08.38]No, let's step on a spider.
[377:11.36]I think I'm taking a monster.
[377:12.47]Oh
[377:14.71]I'm not a monster, guys.
[377:15.99]This one's going to be a little different though, so I got to pay attention.
[377:33.02]Last fold.
[377:33.72]It's a tight one.
[377:35.50]Alright.
[377:39.44]What do we got?
[377:40.32]How does it go together?
[377:45.04]So I got this the right way.
[377:46.82]No, I do.
[377:48.52]This goes up and around, and then the tab goes in.
[377:52.37]I can do that.
[377:57.61]Like so.
[378:00.19]Then close up the back end in the order.
[378:04.97]Top and then around.
[378:05.79]Yeah, I've done that before.
[378:12.41]Done.
[378:16.23]Now what's this piece you ask?
[378:22.27]It's a weight.
[378:25.20]So fold it in half and stick it in like this.
[378:31.64]It's a weight.
[378:38.37]Push it all the way into the key.
[378:40.71]This key is kind of thin, so it needs some extra weight inside to keep it stable.
[378:55.55]I guess?
[378:55.87]That's it?
[378:59.39]This key uses a separate piece for the front part that you actually press.
[379:05.41]Strange.
[379:05.81]Just flip this around and take out the bullshit.
[379:14.65]They did this to break up the monotony.
[379:17.53]I'm guaranteeing it.
[379:20.09]Fold this all into a little box.
[379:27.12]Okay, let's load this up.
[379:33.61]Piano's the longest one.
[379:35.47]I can see that.
[379:36.73]Seems pretty long.
[379:37.41]A lot of content, though.
[379:39.83]That's okay.
[379:41.33]I'm not angry about that.
[379:42.43]This is great.
[379:45.45]Close that.
[379:48.67]And a couple more.
[379:49.95]Is that a full point?
[379:51.11]Yeah, it is.
[379:53.91]And then one more.
[379:55.91]Got it.
[379:57.17]Pull it into a box.
[380:00.59]Line up the tab and then roll it up high.
[380:03.15]Little tooth.
[380:03.75]We see you there.
[380:04.43]This goes up like this.
[380:08.74]Around and then this comes across like that.
[380:12.62]Hold that there.
[380:13.30]And what does it come up all the way around?
[380:15.42]It does.
[380:16.82]Up and around.
[380:18.82]Little tooth sticking out.
[380:22.29]Tab goes all the way underneath.
[380:26.27]Like that.
[380:30.42]Okay.
[380:33.36]I can see the little nub there, yeah.
[380:36.10]I can see it.
[380:39.56]And that goes all the way to the end?
[380:41.72]Now all you need to do is attach it to the end of the key.
[380:43.74]It might be a tight fit.
[380:45.02]Sorry about that.
[380:46.70]Is the Labo fucking apologizing to me?
[380:50.40]This.
[380:55.80]How's this supposed to go in there?
[381:02.18]Sorry about that, dude.
[381:04.12]Okay, so this goes in like this.
[381:06.12]I guess that's in?
[381:12.52]Right?
[381:16.20]Spin it around and that's it, right?
[381:19.44]Flip up the tail.
[381:22.98]And this goes in.
[381:28.25]Oh shit, I need to coax any one of these little things.
[381:32.01]Okay, this goes around the front.
[381:39.41]Go to enough, center enough, put that there.
[381:42.57]Done.
[381:49.77]With the tail spring bent forward, slide it into the keyboard right there, okay.
[381:57.72]Jeez, I'm gonna drop this, I know it.
[382:00.46]Just wait for it.
[382:01.74]Smash this thing into the fucking ground.
[382:03.20]I'm gonna start cursing right here.
[382:06.77]Right there.
[382:19.52]Alright.
[382:22.86]So now I got one, I got two more keys to do.
[382:27.14]Three parts from sheet A. Getting close to the end here.
[382:38.69]So one, two, three.
[382:40.21]It's another one of these single keys.
[382:42.69]These are weird weighted keys that they broke up.
[382:45.55]Shit's not even fucking real.
[382:46.71]Alright, I've done this before.
[382:49.57]I'm gonna try to do this one quick.
[382:52.05]Because I've already done it.
[382:52.96]There's one more of these.
[383:00.97]Same key as the last one, okay.
[383:02.90]I know how to make it, let's just get it done.
[383:07.32]Speed run to speed run the piano.
[383:13.63]Trying to get her done.
[383:14.55]There's that fat guy that says that fucking funny line.
[383:24.01]Get her down!
[383:24.88]That guy made.
[383:28.97]600 million dollars saying that by the way you know you guys know that guy's from New York right that guy's not a redneck let me tell you something about being a redneck that guy's from like long island Larry the cable guy that was an act he was a character that wasn't a real person that was like me doing grandpa and people thinking I was actually grandpa
[383:52.44]Like, hey, it's me, Grandpa!
[383:53.86]It's me, how you doing?
[383:55.00]This is fucking stupid!
[383:56.48]Like, as if you believed I was actually that person.
[384:00.58]That guy's from New York.
[384:01.34]Look up Larry the Cable Guy, New York.
[384:03.74]Stand up.
[384:06.01]The whole thing was a lie.
[384:12.99]Where's Grandpa?
[384:14.19]He died.
[384:14.53]He'll be alright, though.
[384:18.05]No, he won't!
[384:18.63]Alright.
[384:20.29]Fast forward!
[384:21.59]I know how to build it, but I just want to get to the end of it.
[384:24.49]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[384:26.71]Up, up, up.
[384:31.25]But imagine doing a character that everybody thinks is real.
[384:33.49]And it's just been total fucking horseshit the whole time.
[384:39.82]It must get so tiring.
[384:41.80]Imagine if every single stream I was just talking like this the whole fucking stream.
[384:46.67]Hey guys, it's me, Grandpa.
[384:48.37]Every single fucking stream I do, it's just me doing this.
[384:52.01]How are you?
[384:53.15]Yep, today we're gonna be looking at some funny thing on screen today.
[384:56.64]Oh my God, it's so tiring after five years.
[385:05.94]I can't imagine doing that every single day.
[385:07.82]Alright, this thing, yep, the weight goes like this.
[385:19.30]Grandpa coming down from the top left.
[385:21.16]Oh, it would just be so exhausting.
[385:25.66]You're just pretending to be some guy.
[385:27.22]Okay, that's in there as the little weight.
[385:34.56]Push it all the way.
[385:36.92]Spin it around.
[385:37.66]Yeah, this already is spun around, so just kind of fold it and make it a little box.
[385:49.84]Like, I understand characters and schticks.
[385:52.56]Like, they can be very funny.
[385:54.86]But holy shit, man.
[385:56.12]If your character turns into your actual life, that gets kind of weird.
[386:03.19]Larry the Cable Guy was on stage.
[386:06.13]He goes to events and just is that guy.
[386:08.89]Now, if you just can't believe that Larry the Cable Guy doesn't understand, like, ugh.
[386:18.77]You have to be that guy every day.
[386:20.49]So this is bottom here like this.
[386:30.31]Must get so tiring being that guy.
[386:34.83]Wish I just didn't have to be fucking Larry the Cable Guy every day.
[386:38.12]This sits, where does this sit?
[386:45.86]Right on the end here.
[386:48.07]They apologize for it being hard to do, but that's fine.
[386:51.23]Oh, I fucking broke it.
[386:54.87]No, I didn't.
[386:59.39]Stick this in.
[387:02.95]It's in, kind of, right?
[387:05.41]Is that in?
[387:05.77]Yeah, it is.
[387:10.48]Upside down, fold it back, stick it in.
[387:12.22]Thank you.
[387:18.25]Put it back in the night sticker Only one more.
[387:23.05]Ah shit.
[387:23.65]Okay.

[387:51.95]That's in.

[388:15.68]And I gotta put a cover up here.
[388:16.94]Assuming that's coming later.
[388:21.33]I'm almost done with all the keys.
[388:22.69]This is the final piece.

[389:29.48]This ain't an anime, this is real life, man.
[389:32.82]I'm a real guy.
[389:34.54]With real feelings and real shiny sweat all over his face.
[389:40.35]It's not even close to being finished?
[389:42.37]Well, we're gonna finish it.
[389:45.13]I'm not gonna give up now, are you kidding me?
[389:47.95]Too far into this.

[390:56.01]Speedrun activated?
[390:57.97]Yeah, I was thinking about being a dickhead and doing a funny little, oh, funny quotes.
[391:03.35]Speedrun, where I just fuck up and just rip everything apart.
[391:07.97]It's just too expensive, though.
[391:09.15]I'm not gonna do that shit.
[391:11.01]Not right now.
[391:11.53]Maybe another day.
[391:13.07]So fold this all up.
[391:20.41]This part comes first, yeah.
[391:23.07]Just like the other ones, up and around.
[391:25.09]Make sure this is nice and tight.
[391:33.32]Looks good.
[391:33.88]Nice and tight.
[391:36.34]Stick this in here.
[391:39.08]Last key.
[391:41.14]Thank God.
[391:42.60]It's fucking over.
[391:45.21]Although that was pretty therapeutic.
[391:47.89]That's in there.
[391:54.56]Kind of want to get it nice and secure.
[391:56.46]Which it is.
[391:58.44]Good.
[391:58.66]Okay.
[391:59.72]Flip it around.
[392:00.34]Hold it back and stick it in.
[392:06.57]Last piece.
[392:07.83]Oh, shit.
[392:08.37]It's kind of stuck.
[392:11.87]Get over here, you fucking little shit.
[392:17.23]Ah, okay.
[392:17.63]Okay.
[392:20.12]No, no, no.
[392:20.78]Don't do that.
[392:22.48]Just lay flat.
[392:23.30]Okay.
[392:23.46]Okay.
[392:29.61]Last one is a go.
[392:32.75]I don't like how that's sitting on there.
[392:37.13]Put it on again.
[392:37.71]So I'm so tired, please play the piano so that I can sleep.
[392:45.23]I'm hoping to be pretty much done soon here.
[392:48.08]I can't imagine there's very much left.
[392:51.24]But there might be.
[392:55.04]Stick that in, that's all the keys, done.
[392:58.01]I know how it goes in, you fucking little asshole.
[393:00.29]Okay, like this.
[393:03.82]Slide it in.
[393:08.96]There it is.
[393:09.44]Ooh, don't be too fucking rough.
[393:14.99]Okay, good.
[393:17.35]Now what?
[393:18.47]There's something you don't see every day.
[393:20.05]All those cardboard keys lined up.
[393:21.55]Kind of makes you cry, doesn't it?
[393:26.51]Alright, we're ready for the final check.
[393:27.99]Take a peek into the piano from behind.
[393:32.21]When you press each key, the marker sticker should pop up.
[393:34.67]You don't forget.
[393:35.34]You didn't forget any, no?
[393:37.24]Let's just check it.
[393:46.62]Yeah, I mean, it looks fucking fine.
[393:48.40]Yeah, it looks fine.
[393:54.12]It looks good.
[393:56.25]It looks good to go.
[393:57.49]Seal it up.
[393:59.55]Done.
[394:06.52]Okay, make sure that's closed up down here.
[394:09.80]Looks pretty damn good.
[394:13.98]Don't forget to close the lid.
[394:15.89]Seal it up.
[394:18.35]The keyboard is complete.
[394:21.43]That took a while, didn't it?
[394:23.09]It's cool if you want to take a rest.
[394:27.73]Almost done.
[394:28.85]Screen holder.
[394:30.75]Remove these five pieces from B and F. Almost done.
[394:38.70]B and F. So this is F. One, two, three.
[394:55.93]Screen holder and then a little piece on the back and we're good to go.
[395:01.72]Where did that go?
[395:02.58]Right here.
[395:04.72]Alright, where's B?
[395:07.30]Right here.
[395:11.02]Alright.
[395:12.47]B and F, just the little fighter jet looking thing.
[395:20.71]Screen holder, okay.
[395:23.59]That's it for B. See you later.
[395:25.09]Thanks for playing.
[395:27.13]Can probably put this on the ground now.
[395:30.21]Yeah, you can.
[395:32.41]Alright, let's get this spread out on the table the way it's supposed to look.
[395:37.63]B and F. Okay, one, two, three, four, five, we're good.
[395:45.62]He's still sweating.
[395:47.90]What do you want me to do?
[395:49.42]One piece from G.
[395:52.96]I need this huge one right here.
[396:03.95]That's a big piece.
[396:06.45]One piece from G. That's it.
[396:10.77]Whew!
[396:14.16]Alright, we'll also need two of the sponge stickers from the plastic bag.
[396:21.88]Two of these.
[396:24.62]Alright.
[396:25.14]Sponge stickers.
[396:27.34]Two of them.
[396:29.96]Alright.
[396:31.04]With the printed side up, stick these two sponge stickers as shown.
[396:37.01]Get out of the fucking way, you little dickheads.
[396:44.87]Okay, get out of here.
[396:47.73]Printed side up.
[396:48.75]This has to come out.
[396:53.66]I'm going to hold on to that.
[396:54.38]I might need that in a minute.
[396:55.48]Okay.
[396:55.98]Like this.
[396:56.52]This has to come up too.
[396:58.92]This middle piece.
[397:01.66]These squares.
[397:05.10]Just like that.
[397:05.85]Okay.
[397:08.37]Over here too.
[397:10.61]Little nubs on the sides.
[397:14.35]Yeah.
[397:16.35]I'm sweating my ass off.
[397:19.29]It's hard to build a grand piano from scratch.
[397:22.25]It is.
[397:24.63]Alright.
[397:25.31]So we need a sticker, a sponge sticker here and here.
[397:30.44]Am I mistaken with that?
[397:39.17]Peel this off?
[397:42.25]Am I mistaken?
[397:43.61]That's correct, right?
[397:49.12]It's going to be hard to open this.
[397:50.80]Get this out.
[397:54.03]The window's open?
[397:54.85]I mean, it is, but it's very humid outside.
[397:56.75]It's like a thousand degrees out there.
[398:00.67]Give or take.
[398:01.97]Come on, you little shit.
[398:03.67]You gonna be this hard to get out?
[398:12.53]There it is.
[398:14.71]Alright, sponge sticker one goes up there.
[398:19.55]Right on the edge.
[398:22.12]Right here.
[398:28.96]Like that.
[398:32.44]Okay, and the other one goes down here.
[398:39.22]Come on, you little shit.
[398:45.32]Pain in the ass.
[398:45.94]This little paper is so hard to get off.
[398:47.36]I don't have any nails either, so it makes it way harder.
[398:56.84]Different corner, come on.
[398:59.61]You can do it.
[399:01.09]I have faith.
[399:03.85]You little asshole.
[399:10.16]Get out.
[399:11.46]Get out.
[399:17.82]It's the hardest thing so far.
[399:20.82]There we go.
[399:21.68]Okay, right down here.
[399:25.77]Fuck!
[399:26.83]No!
[399:27.31]What?! !
[399:35.60]No!
[399:36.16]I'm so close.
[399:36.98]What happened?
[399:50.70]That looks like shit.
[399:51.88]Put it on again.
[399:52.40]Fucking little ass.
[400:03.38]God damn it.
[400:03.94]It looks terrible.
[400:04.98]Fuck!
[400:10.98]It's fine.
[400:14.82]That's it's fine.
[400:15.75]It's fine.
[400:16.09]It's fine.
[400:16.39]It's fine.
[400:16.61]It's fine.
[400:17.05]It's fine.
[400:17.43]Look at chat.
[400:18.99]What are you talking about?
[400:19.71]What happened?
[400:20.01]What'd I do?
[400:30.20]What are you talking?
[400:30.88]What?
[400:32.66]I did it wrong.
[400:35.28]Each is two stickers.
[400:46.66]So I only need that.
[401:04.99]Problem solved.
[401:05.77]We're fine.
[401:10.05]Just stick them on here.
[401:11.17]We're good.
[401:14.53]Those are fine.
[401:15.61]No, this is fine.
[401:16.22]We're good.
[401:17.28]That's fine.
[401:21.56]Does not... Does... Mouse fucking control, you idiot.
[401:24.90]Alright, now it's time to get creasing.
[401:26.10]Flip over the whole thing.
[401:27.20]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[401:29.96]This.
[401:32.00]Start folding.
[401:39.99]That's it.
[401:40.27]It's creased.
[401:45.86]I had to attend handiwork.
[401:47.40]I'm trying.
[401:51.81]Hydrate now or I'm gonna die.
[401:54.39]I'll be okay.
[401:56.33]Don't worry about me.
[402:00.25]Put these in.
[402:01.22]Drink water.
[402:09.94]Actually, I got an iced tea upstairs.
[402:11.12]I'm gonna drink some iced tea.
[402:13.07]On my own terms.
[402:16.74]let's fold this okay a couple more right in the middle it's gonna be tricky but get it right there crease it nice there's another one too right in the middle pain in the ass tea is not water that's fine
[402:46.78]What's wrong with my hair?
[402:48.48]I put it in a little shitty bun and it fell out.
[402:54.05]Let me fix it.
[402:56.17]That's gone.
[402:56.79]I'll never find that again.
[402:59.57]I hope I don't need that for anything soon.
[403:05.08]Okay.
[403:05.94]This is folded.
[403:08.20]More than a few times here.
[403:09.48]Alright, let's go.
[403:11.52]What's next?
[403:22.42]How do I put it together?
[403:23.20]Okay, now let's get building.
[403:26.32]So this part comes up and wraps around.
[403:30.45]This whole thing folds up, apparently.
[403:32.15]You hear that?
[403:47.78]It's a coyote.
[403:54.86]That was a coyote.
[404:00.72]Right out there.
[404:09.00]That was like... Yeah, that was loud.
[404:12.64]Yeah, that was a coyote.
[404:14.00]Alright, here we go.
[404:14.80]So let's go here.
[404:15.68]And this folds up like that, right?
[404:25.73]Comes all the way up and goes in this hole.
[404:30.19]So that's put together like that.
[404:34.07]Flip the whole thing up so it looks like this.
[404:38.75]Take a peek from the side to make sure everything looks like it is in the right place.
[404:47.77]Yeah, it does.
[404:50.19]Looks like it's correct, right?
[404:59.00]This is a triangle in there.
[405:02.04]Looks close enough.
[405:12.32]Push the whole front surface inward a bit so you can fold back the bottom flap.
[405:16.74]They should slot neatly together.
[405:18.28]Just like this.
[405:19.92]Like that.
[405:24.48]Okay.
[405:27.78]Now for this piece, it's the one with the play and pause symbol printed on the end.
[405:35.83]Got it.
[405:39.57]Start folding it.
[405:44.55]Cool.
[405:45.05]Okay.
[405:45.71]Fold that.
[405:47.23]Fold this.
[405:49.45]And fold this.
[405:52.42]Down a little bit.
[405:53.18]There we go.
[405:55.18]okay cool not very many folds so that's good so then it goes you fold this piece up so it's flat like this and then tip it around like that bring this piece forward and stick it through so you got a weird little triangle thing looking here okay
[406:23.96]then this piece is very similar to the last one but it has a stop symbol on it fold it up easy enough that's just getting real close this is like an animal right here it's gonna scream in the window just giving you a warning if it happens just be ready for it it's gonna be a coyote yelling in the window
[406:54.69]Okay, so this is the same thing.
[406:58.62]So fold it up like that, flip it up and stick it in here.
[407:07.40]So here's the play and the pause.
[407:08.96]Alright, so then take the piece with the play pause symbol and slide it all the way into the main piece, which is this one.
[407:26.99]Oh, shit.
[407:27.35]Okay, so that goes in here.
[407:30.39]So that slides all the way in.
[407:32.05]Flap here.
[407:32.49]Look at this.
[407:44.78]How far does it go?
[407:45.42]Is that in?
[407:51.12]Flap down.
[407:51.90]I guess that's in.
[407:57.08]Strangely, that's in apparently.
[407:59.90]Same thing on the other side.
[408:02.96]Same thing with the stop side.
[408:06.08]Slide it in.
[408:06.74]Fold it down, okay.
[408:15.89]That's in.
[408:20.09]Next we're gonna make some buttons to press.
[408:22.47]There are two of these to make and they're both the same.
[408:25.98]These look like these two pieces here.
[408:30.45]Holy shit, there's a lot of things to fold.
[408:32.13]Look at that.
[408:35.07]Jesus Christ.
[408:35.77]Alright, actually, I'm going to pee and I'm going to get a drink.
[408:43.26]I'll be back in like two minutes.
[408:45.18]I'll be right back.
[408:46.24]Stay tuned.
[410:48.31]Is the coyote going to play the piano?
[410:52.78]Yeah.
[410:54.72]See what he's up to after the stream.
[411:01.82]Okay, we're good.
[411:05.94]Especially tonight.
[411:07.04]It's so hot down here.
[411:10.55]When I move to Nevada, I swear to God.
[411:13.44]It's going to be so much better having real central air in the whole house.
[411:17.95]Ay-yi-yi.
[411:24.09]It's lemonade iced tea.
[411:25.29]It's fine.
[411:25.77]I must have dropped it.
[411:28.21]Alright, let's go.
[411:30.77]Roll it up.
[411:33.64]Did you lick your hands clean?
[411:35.30]No.
[411:36.28]Not today.
[411:39.48]That's not... It's iced tea.
[411:41.16]It's not soylent.
[411:45.90]I don't drink Soylent.
[411:48.92]We already talked about this on the Destroy All Humans stream.
[411:53.18]Okay, a little piece right here.
[411:58.33]Should get these two.
[412:00.47]And this thing rolls up like a little donut.
[412:07.65]Somebody wrote in all caps and it scared me.
[412:09.37]Alright, so how does this roll up?
[412:14.92]Bing, bing, bing, and it snaps in.
[412:16.38]Like that.
[412:24.25]There you go.
[412:24.99]Perfect.
[412:26.67]Looking good.
[412:27.13]So how do the other ones come in?
[412:28.23]Just the same thing?
[412:29.01]Wait, hold on, that's weird.
[412:31.62]So it folds up and then in.
[412:35.04]Up and in.
[412:38.30]This one's weird, though.
[412:39.06]This one folds backwards.
[412:43.62]This one goes down and then... Wait, wait, wait.
[412:50.91]This tab on the other end is actually going to be a spring.
[412:56.29]So I just go like this.
[413:00.51]Keep it like that.
[413:02.19]Okay.
[413:03.83]Easy enough.
[413:06.31]Now for the marker, we want to wrap it all the way around the bottom end to make sure you don't put it at the top.
[413:13.21]Huh?
[413:14.29]so I need one of the longer ones watch the video carefully how is that not the top one of these ones the strips okay strips
[413:43.35]So then go all the way around from the bottom.
[413:51.43]Cross around the edge like so, and then wrap it around the top like that.
[414:06.41]Okay.
[414:09.56]That's good, right?
[414:12.57]All the way around once.
[414:15.71]Which it has.
[414:16.21]Now where does it go?
[414:18.43]Let's do the other button.
[414:19.77]It's exactly the same as the first one.
[414:21.15]Make sure to crease all the folds.
[414:23.65]Same thing.
[414:24.17]Move this one out of the way.
[414:30.62]I hit it on stream.
[414:31.56]Yeah, it did.
[414:33.20]Still going?
[414:33.88]Yeah.
[414:36.20]Not for very much longer.
[414:37.50]We're pretty much... We have like one more sheet and that's it.
[414:45.96]Fold a couple times there.
[414:48.60]There's that.
[414:53.38]Good, good, good, good.
[414:58.72]This man is a trooper.
[415:03.79]No, I mean, I'm tired.
[415:06.05]I am.
[415:07.23]But I'm having fun.
[415:09.15]This is a blast.
[415:10.21]This thing's fucking cool.
[415:11.19]It's been the same thing.
[415:13.11]Just wrap it all around, stick it in, flip it around.
[415:16.05]Do the same thing at the end, right?
[415:17.97]Yeah.
[415:27.02]Fits in the right way?
[415:27.66]Yeah.
[415:29.94]Same thing with this one.
[415:30.68]It just kind of sticks in, and then this one sticks out with a little spring on the end, like this.
[415:38.64]And then we have to wrap this one again, right?
[415:43.34]All these little strips, same thing around the end.
[415:50.67]One more piece here for this last, there's one more part after this.
[415:54.49]Almost done though.
[415:55.17]Let's just relax and play a little Labo, what do you say?
[416:09.72]Wrap it around, complete.
[416:12.92]There we go.
[416:15.46]Game sucks, game does not suck.
[416:18.82]Don't you dare say that.
[416:24.94]Alright, what the hell do I do with these?
[416:29.40]I want, give me that pizza.
[416:33.21]That sounds pretty good right now.
[416:35.01]It's like a hair on it, but whatever.
[416:36.25]Alright.
[416:39.19]Alright, so this goes in here.
[416:54.63]My cholesterol... Who gives a shit?
[416:58.15]Alright, so what button does it... Does it matter which one goes in where?
[417:07.06]Looks like this.
[417:13.58]Gre... No, no.
[417:14.24]Sweaty hair.
[417:14.96]Not greasy hair.
[417:15.74]Sweaty hair.
[417:16.22]Looks like it goes in like this.
[417:30.22]that okay looks good second button does the same where'd it go in my hand is that correct it is right yeah
[418:06.48]Alright, got the two buttons.
[418:12.50]Is the equivalent of smoking a cigarette?
[418:14.46]No, it's not.
[418:15.08]Is there more pizza in there?
[418:22.67]Empty.
[418:37.29]Saved it.
[418:40.29]Is there a bug on here?
[418:41.94]No.
[418:48.97]OK, hold on.
[418:50.43]Buttons are in place, yeah.
[419:10.38]Mm-hmm.
[419:11.61]Mm-hmm.

[419:22.01]Yeah.
[419:25.19]Pizza grease, I can wash them.
[419:26.60]They'll be fine.
[419:30.42]We've got one more important button to make.
[419:32.00]This one.
[419:42.17]You know what pizza?
[419:43.77]I think there is.
[419:51.41]Yeah.
[419:54.11]There's no more pizza.
[419:55.01]It's all gone.
[419:56.85]Fucking cholesterol.
[419:59.32]Fuck it.
[419:59.64]Alright, let's go.
[420:04.06]This pizza is really good too.
[420:05.72]It's a great local place.
[420:07.38]It's fantastic.
[420:24.86]Hi, can I get an order, please?

[420:58.12]See you soon.
[420:59.90]Thank you.
[421:04.22]What am I doing?
[421:14.56]Fold these.
[421:18.81]I'm worried about you, Jeremy.
[421:19.89]Don't be.
[421:20.61]I'm just fucking around.
[421:24.80]Or am I?
[421:25.16]I don't know.
[421:28.14]Depends on how you see it, right?
[421:31.30]No.
[421:39.09]Getting close.
[421:40.21]He's so close.
[421:45.19]One more button and there's a handful more keys to make.
[421:48.55]Looks like over there.
[421:52.47]These little tiny creases.
[421:55.44]Fucking hell.
[421:59.38]I'm so hungry.
[422:00.14]I hope those pieces get here quick.
[422:04.66]So let's see.
[422:05.52]These are all been folded.
[422:08.22]Gonna make a little cube, right?
[422:13.61]Okay, now let's push it together.
[422:16.55]Be sure to push the tab all the way in.
[422:19.81]So really just roll it.
[422:20.91]Like this.
[422:23.85]Like that.
[422:27.69]No, not right there.
[422:30.89]This goes in, right?
[422:32.01]Like that.
[422:38.94]Got one big tab out here.
[422:40.24]All these close in.
[422:42.92]This comes across like that.
[422:48.33]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[422:54.77]So these, spin this around like that.
[422:57.35]It's facing the right way.
[423:00.49]Can you guess what these button tabs are for?
[423:02.29]They're springs.
[423:03.05]So pull them both out like this.
[423:05.78]Interesting, okay.
[423:15.89]So that's, looks pretty close, right?
[423:18.89]Now where does this go?
[423:23.89]I don't know where this is supposed to go.
[423:25.05]I've got to wrap around the long sticker.
[423:31.47]There's only a few on here.
[423:32.89]It's going to go all the way around the bottom.
[423:39.47]It goes around the bottom.
[423:40.23]Okay.
[423:44.86]All the way around town.
[423:46.28]Get it down there.
[423:47.00]I can't wait to recycle this.
[423:51.48]This like six hours of work is going to go right into the recycling bin.
[423:55.92]Like seven hours.
[423:58.60]Actually, it probably won't.
[423:59.42]I'll play with it.
[424:02.38]It's done.
[424:03.42]Good.
[424:07.41]Alright.
[424:07.89]Stick it in.
[424:13.59]It's all wrapped up.
[424:15.35]Okay.
[424:16.85]This button goes in the main body of the piano.
[424:21.91]So like this, it goes in this.
[424:33.90]So this goes in here like this.
[424:55.17]Doesn't feel right.
[424:57.29]It's not giving me very much give.
[425:06.19]No, it is.
[425:06.57]Okay.
[425:10.77]Time to try pressing.
[425:11.67]Can you see the marker?
[425:13.75]Can I?
[425:15.39]Yeah.
[425:17.43]Yeah, I can see it.
[425:20.18]I can see it poking through.
[425:21.90]Looks okay.
[425:22.26]Alright.
[425:25.33]We're at the final stage of the piano.
[425:27.23]This is it.
[425:29.78]Six out of six.
[425:30.48]Attach the screen holder to the main piano body.
[425:36.56]Put these flaps out.
[425:39.82]Almost there.
[425:41.10]I can taste it.
[425:48.25]So it goes in like this.
[425:55.88]Fold these tabs over and slide them firmly into the slots.
[425:59.56]So, like this.
[426:05.27]And the tabs go in on both sides, and that's it.
[426:07.75]One more on the sides to get in.
[426:16.17]Get in there, you fucking little shit.
[426:17.69]Alright.
[426:18.87]In this way, snap.
[426:21.99]In this way, snap.
[426:29.22]getting there okay screen holders complete that's the whole piano done but I'm afraid we're not actually finished we still have to make the secret knobs
[427:14.84]Well, there ain't very much left.
[427:16.38]There's only sheet H. There can't be very much left.
[427:19.78]Fucking secret ass knobs, really?

[427:31.01]Okay, hold on.
[427:33.30]Secret fucking knobs.
[427:37.40]The last thing we have to make is the secret knobs.

[428:54.67]Okay, there's one secret knob.
[428:58.52]Stick it on there.
[428:59.38]We also need to place six small stickers.
[429:01.66]What are you talking about?

[431:56.73]I'm not sure what you'd even determine that to be.
[432:00.07]Okay, fold all six.
[432:01.39]Now we're gonna roll the whole thing up in a hexagon.
[432:06.63]So the whole thing needs to be creased and then rolled up in a hexagon.
[432:12.39]Oh, jeez.
[432:14.26]My lord.
[432:14.96]Okay, fold it up.
[432:17.54]This should be okay.
[432:18.52]Fold this.
[432:21.98]Hoping the cardboard will cut out the insomnia.
[432:24.58]Well, I'll be there with you after this stream, that's for sure.
[432:30.78]This might not be up until like 3 or 4 in the morning.
[432:32.30]It's going to be one of the first streams I ever do that goes past 2 or 3 a.m.
[432:38.49]It's a first for everything as they say, right?
[432:41.17]Okay, so how does this work?
[432:43.85]So the big piece right here goes across almost all the way to here.
[432:49.59]Like that.
[432:51.65]And then the other piece comes across too.
[432:53.61]You make like a little, a cute little ball like this
[433:04.49]Then what do you do?
[433:12.11]Now slot the cover neatly into this end.
[433:15.11]Make sure the stickers don't come off.
[433:18.28]Let's see what I can do again.
[433:21.78]Wait, hold on.
[433:22.26]How does this go?
[433:24.46]Just sticks in.
[433:25.50]OK.
[433:27.34]So it just sticks in.
[433:38.35]I gotta make six of these things?
[433:39.97]You gotta be shitting me.
[433:41.87]That's it.
[433:49.77]Stickers did not come off.
[433:51.85]That's good.
[433:55.78]Now for the head of the knob, make sure this one has a one mark on it.
[433:59.42]It does.
[434:03.36]Good luck.
[434:04.64]No, not really.
[434:08.68]Thank you for the well wishes, though.
[434:12.06]Appreciate that.
[434:17.48]Fold in half.
[434:19.46]Just fold everything.
[434:20.43]It's going to be a bunch of folds, yeah.
[434:21.63]Alright, fold everything.
[434:31.89]11?
[434:31.93]Why are you saying 11?
[434:34.47]11.
[434:36.71]What's with the 11?
[434:37.33]I don't understand.
[434:41.49]Okay, got this over here.
[434:44.35]Bingo.
[434:44.75]Bingo.
[434:48.13]Okay, then it wants me to flip it over like this.
[434:56.34]You gotta plug it in like an outlet.
[434:59.66]Slide the three, what's going on?
[435:01.32]Why are we in emote only?
[435:02.06]What happened?
[435:03.78]Three taps firmly through the three holes.
[435:05.59]Try to do it all at once.
[435:06.61]So like this.
[435:18.89]Jesus, it's gonna go through?
[435:20.73]It's through.
[435:31.88]One, two, three.
[435:36.50]They're all through.
[435:37.14]There you go, guys.
[435:39.80]There's your one secret knob.
[435:46.04]Turn it upside down.
[435:47.14]What do we got now?
[435:48.14]Fold it into... Jesus, this is so elaborate.
[435:51.26]Fold it into itself.
[435:54.25]Stick the tabs in.
[435:57.89]What are the knobs even for?
[435:59.15]That's it, right?
[436:11.94]Knob one is done.
[436:15.36]That was just one knob.
[436:17.34]So how do you use these knobs?
[436:18.62]I'm so glad you asked.
[436:19.46]First, you slide them into the round hole in the piano.
[436:26.02]Then you twist them around.
[436:27.26]Go on, give it a try.
[436:28.22]Okay.
[436:34.28]That was fun.
[436:44.07]Thanks for the tip.
[436:47.49]I hope that was informative, now let's take the knob out for a moment.
[436:59.90]Three part- more knobs.

[446:04.29]Same thing as before.
[446:06.01]Roll it up.

[446:17.71]I'm sorry to hear that.
[446:18.55]I wish I could correct it.
[446:22.21]But just look internally, right?
[446:26.59]Look inside yourself.
[446:27.39]Maybe you'll find the answer.
[446:30.13]I can't really give it to you.
[446:38.43]One more roll there.
[446:39.69]Alright.

[447:08.47]Ah, fuck, I just ripped it.
[447:09.97]Sorry.
[447:13.57]Okay, fold it.
[447:16.30]You know the drill by now.
[447:24.81]Folding is fun.
[447:26.57]Something satisfying about the little tension you get as you put your fingers around it.
[447:32.37]Something can be said about it.
[447:33.71]Stick this in.
[447:34.51]Put it in there.
[447:36.51]Knob number three.
[447:43.71]I must crush that with my thighs.
[447:47.94]Trying to go too fast.
[447:49.84]I almost just blew the thing up.
[447:56.82]There we go.
[447:57.56]One, two, three sides.
[448:02.58]Snapped in.
[448:03.88]Looking good.
[448:04.44]Flip it around.
[448:06.88]And one, two.
[448:08.06]Stick that in.
[448:11.92]Stick.
[448:13.31]And stick.
[448:16.23]Knob three.

[448:31.89]But go ahead and show everybody how well I did it.
[448:36.35]Almost done.
[448:36.73]I wonder if they're gonna... Yeah, the last three parts.
[448:45.96]This is it.
[448:48.28]H...
[448:51.67]What do I do with H?
[448:52.13]It's right there.
[448:56.17]The final knob.
[449:00.13]And then I can finally play the piano.
[449:03.58]Exhausted.
[449:04.14]We used a lot of brain power today, guys.
[449:08.30]I've used, ooh.
[449:10.52]It's the first rip of the evening.
[449:12.34]Can't believe it took me that long.
[449:14.26]Alright, one, two, three, that's it.
[449:18.99]Last knob.
[449:20.19]This one doesn't have a number, though.
[449:22.14]Somehow.
[449:22.42]Okay.
[449:26.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[449:28.40]That's the last of the pieces we need for the piano.
[449:30.48]Don't get rid of the extra pieces, though.
[449:31.82]They'll come in handy.
[449:34.73]For now, let's store sheets D, G, and H safely away in the box.
[449:39.33]Final knob.
[449:40.03]This one has no number, just a mysterious zero mark.
[449:43.05]Ooh!
[449:44.49]That's a big, fat one.
[449:51.41]What time is it?
[449:52.77]Ooh, it is two o'clock in the morning.
[449:56.13]Damn.
[449:56.51]Alright, I gotta get this done.
[449:59.25]Didn't realize it was that late guys, sorry.
[450:01.92]Usually stop around like 1.30 if I go this late.
[450:07.54]Last knob though, we're almost done.
[450:08.98]Okay.
[450:16.98]I'm gonna assume this is pitch based.
[450:18.83]It's gonna change the pitch of everything, right?
[450:22.24]last six little slots yeah there is here we go one slot I'm gonna sell this stuff can I sell this piano like a piano store we'll take this just get this done quick quick quick
[450:49.66]If I tried to speedrun this piano, this would've been a disaster.
[450:52.64]I'm glad I didn't.
[450:59.34]Cool.
[451:01.94]Piano raffle?
[451:04.85]Bidding starts at one dollar.
[451:10.33]And ends at fuckin' four dollars.
[451:14.77]And I'm the four dollar bill.
[451:17.49]It's mine.
[451:19.73]Alright, that's it.
[451:21.57]That's how I know I'm done.
[451:22.55]The sticker shit is empty.
[451:26.86]I almost just couldn't tear that.
[451:28.04]Did I?
[451:28.52]No.
[451:28.94]Okay.
[451:29.50]We're good.
[451:35.49]$60 game?
[451:35.99]Actually, actually, $70 game.
[451:39.45]You got it wrong.
[451:40.07]$70.
[451:41.13]Alright, same deal.
[451:43.49]Fold it up.
[451:48.43]Look at how strong I am.
[451:54.33]I didn't need the edges.
[451:55.49]It told me I was done.
[451:57.27]I'm gonna listen to the video game.
[452:01.79]There we go.
[452:03.28]Almost done with the secret knob.
[452:07.18]This.
[452:09.38]Very good.
[452:10.26]Alright, same deal.
[452:11.42]This comes in.
[452:14.00]Just like all the other ones.
[452:19.00]I didn't even bend these.
[452:20.14]I didn't fold these at all.
[452:22.16]My bad.
[452:26.30]I would pay $70 for this if I had a Switch.
[452:29.68]I actually... How long has this stream been?
[452:32.31]We've streamed seven and a half hours.
[452:37.41]Holy sh... Okay, I didn't... Okay.
[452:45.62]So if you figure... I've done...
[452:48.34]The two most complicated ones on stream.
[452:55.13]The fishing rod and the piano are the two longest, I think.
[453:00.47]So if you figure about three or four hours per for each thing.
[453:07.57]The other one's probably going to be like 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
[453:11.51]Plus I'm taking my sweet-ass time as well.
[453:14.79]Could have been a lot faster, but I wasn't.
[453:18.85]deal with this one the robot's gonna be 24 hours we'll see I want to do them all man this is fucking fun I might do I might do one or two of them off stream I feel like it's gonna be fun just to do just for a little activity kids would eat this shit up too by the way you got any young kids in your life little brothers cousins nieces nephews they would go absolutely Lady Gaga over this shit
[453:48.98]Alright, last one, done.
[453:50.28]I feel so accomplished.
[454:00.35]One, two, get in there.
[454:05.09]Okay, one, two, three are in.
[454:07.31]Let's bring this around.
[454:14.57]Number zero.
[454:15.81]I am ready to play the piano.
[454:17.77]You guys, we've been waiting like four hours for this shit.
[454:22.35]Done.
[454:24.47]Let's go.
[454:29.23]What do you say?
[454:37.66]I don't care.
[454:42.14]Put that goddamn piano up here, I'm trying to play it.
[454:47.52]The longer she streams, the more he looks like a serial killer is what somebody said.
[454:52.49]That's alright.
[454:55.35]You know it ain't true.
[455:03.36]This is the music that's been playing the whole time.
[455:11.00]Really?
[455:13.23]For fucking seven and a half hours?
[455:19.21]Why didn't somebody tell me this was playing?
[455:25.81]This has been playing for seven and a half hours.
[455:28.83]Why didn't somebody tell me?
[455:44.89]It's been a long journey.
[455:45.87]The next step is the last one, finally.
[455:50.47]There's more?
[455:51.55]Alright.
[455:55.29]Catching the Joy-Con controllers.
[455:57.83]Stick them in there.
[455:59.51]Get your console and Joy-Con ready.
[456:02.37]I'm ready.
[456:03.54]Watch this.
[456:11.76]Console.

[456:28.15]Alright, console is ready.
[456:30.73]Joy-Con is ready.
[456:31.39]Insert the Nintendo Switch into the screen holder.

[456:56.37]That's in.
[457:01.42]Alright.

[457:07.22]Next up is the right Joy-Con.
[457:09.24]Ready to insert it?
[457:10.42]It's the one with the plus.
[457:11.34]Yes, I am.
[457:17.22]How's that going?
[457:18.18]Like this.
[457:20.38]Like this.
[457:26.09]Eat my ass.
[457:32.33]Eat my ass!
[457:43.30]So this goes like this.
[457:49.54]The button's facing out.
[457:51.84]Down like this.
[457:53.14]Okay.
[458:00.25]That's in.
[458:00.65]Alright, now what?
[458:08.55]The toy piano is ready to play.
[458:10.47]Let's make some music.
[458:17.92]You guys can hear it, right?
[458:20.45]Alright, play it now.

[459:04.10]Wait, hold on.
[459:17.11]Don't break it.

[478:37.42]The thing in the fridge is definitely not human meat.
[478:47.25]How do I get out of this?
[478:47.97]Give me the other one.
[478:54.84]This vibration one freaks me out.
[479:06.39]Can I sing too?
[479:09.33]Hello?
[479:17.73]Okay, that makes sense.
[479:23.04]Come up.

[479:31.56]No.
[479:35.92]It's two, man.
[479:40.53]Wait, drums.
[479:43.41]How do I select the drums?
[479:59.79]One, two, three, four.
[480:06.38]This fucking thing.
[480:09.22]No, I'm gonna keep it as is.
[480:14.46]Well, that's it.
[480:15.78]That's the Nintendo Switch.
[480:18.45]No, I mean, that's Labo part one.
[480:21.89]Because I will be playing the Labo again.
[480:26.51]Might take a break.
[480:28.66]No stream today.
[480:31.45]No stream literally today.
[480:33.09]Did I fuck up the Joy-Con though?
[480:34.39]I'm not sure I didn't.
[480:40.71]I forgot this was in there and I threw it like a dumb moron.
[480:44.19]This is fine.
[480:45.13]Whoa, whoa, what's going on right now?
[480:47.93]Look at this.
[480:51.83]Play?
[480:52.19]I don't understand.
[480:56.45]Whatever.
[480:59.16]Joy-Cons are sturdy.
[481:00.02]Yeah, actually, I threw Etalyx into the wall when we did the 1-2-3 switch, so I think it should be fine.
[481:06.10]Anyways, that's going to be it.
[481:08.37]It is very, very late.
[481:11.75]I'm recording.
[481:15.53]This thing gets an A-plus from me.
[481:18.69]This was a lot of fun.
[481:22.58]This was very, very, very interesting.
[481:24.90]I almost just
[481:31.49]I almost just died.
[481:32.33]Imagine that.
[481:34.93]You know, I really like this.
[481:35.97]And then you just don't hear anything.
[481:41.92]So, let me move this.
[481:47.56]I just made a take?
[481:49.44]What take?
[481:52.06]You can delete the take you just made.
[481:56.53]Oh fuck, don't knock over.
[481:57.41]Alright, I gotta clean up too.
[481:59.59]What did I just make?
[482:04.01]Let's see what I just did.
[482:11.95]I think I got the jackpot.
[482:14.27]Okay, I don't know.
[482:15.27]Alright, let's do the subs.

[482:45.61]I'm just gonna read and say thanks to everybody.
[482:49.47]Because we got a long, long, long amount of these.
[482:54.94]Because I will be here for like another two hours under like 4 or 5 a.m.

[490:00.15]Is that even a legal thing?
[490:04.33]Jamie2803, thanks for the $5.
[490:08.01]I swear I say innuendos on purpose.
[490:11.41]Sometimes, but not really.
[490:13.43]Ragamoy, thanks for the $6 here.
[490:16.63]Jerma I'm 22, been watching your streams for a while.
[490:18.63]For the past year, I've been vomiting blood every four to five months for no reason.
[490:22.91]And hearing you talk about your disease made me think that I should check it out.
[490:26.24]And after some tests, turns out I might have Crohn's.
[490:28.54]I wanted to ask how did you handle it when you were told that you had the disease?
[490:33.42]Well, IBD is just, the thing with Crohn's, Crohn's can affect pretty much anywhere, as I'm sure you're well aware.
[490:39.33]First of all, sorry to hear that that's something you're going through right now.
[490:43.03]Yeah, hopefully, Ragamoy, if you're still here, it's a pain in the ass.
[490:47.80]It just is.
[490:49.78]You just got to take it one day at a time.
[490:53.02]The first couple years is tough.
[490:55.83]But once you and your doctor get you on a plan to change your diet a little bit, lower your cholesterol like I need to, get on medication and manage it.
[491:08.26]My IBD has been managed for about two years now.
[491:14.14]I have flare-ups that happen all the time.
[491:16.82]But it is managed.
[491:18.18]It takes about a year or two, though.
[491:19.76]So stick with it.
[491:21.42]Listen to your doctor.
[491:24.42]I wish you the best.
[491:27.17]Ragamoi, again, thanks for the $1.
[491:29.17]What steps did I take?
[491:30.93]Do I have any suggestions?
[491:33.41]Thanks a lot, and you died to Pinwheel.
[491:34.96]I did not, that's a lie.
[491:36.32]But thank you for that.
[491:39.82]Yeah, I just listened to what my doctor had to say.
[491:42.22]We tried three or four different medications over a couple of years, and one stuck.
[491:49.11]But thank you, Ragamoi.
[491:50.01]Good luck to you.
[491:51.53]Chaotic Paper, thanks for the $1.

[494:07.68]Cinco Pated for the $1.
[494:10.12]Syrup Buccaneer for the $5.
[494:11.04]What you've done tonight is one-man performance art.
[494:14.40]I'm beginning to think it's the future of the platform.
[494:17.18]You're a trailblazer.
[494:19.71]Thank you, dude.
[494:21.85]I just put cardboard together, though, tonight.
[494:24.51]I did have a lot of fun doing it, though.
[494:26.27]But thank you so much for the incredibly kind words.
[494:29.53]Casey, thanks for the $1.
[494:30.73]Grillmaster, thanks for the $1.50.
[494:33.79]Thank you, Auditor, for the $1.00.
[494:36.54]Been a fan since TF2 days, although I can't sub.
[494:38.84]I did wait for bits so I could let you know about a Chrome extension called Frankerface that lets you upload emotes.
[494:45.61]Yeah, somebody told me about that before.
[494:47.41]I was actually looking into it.
[494:49.85]We'll see.
[494:50.19]Thank you, though.
[494:50.69]Thank you, Auditor.
[494:52.11]Thank you, that Fallout guy for the $1.
[494:53.55]You know, Jerma is a true East Coast boy when you see the anger in his eyes while fishing.
[494:57.17]I don't know how to fish.
[494:59.25]I have no idea.
[495:02.75]You cast it into the water and you pull it up when there's a bite.
[495:06.16]Sounds easy enough.
[495:09.02]Like eight hours worth of bits.
[495:10.04]We're almost done.
[495:10.66]Hey, Casey, thanks for the $1.
[495:13.65]You can actually play Mario Kart with the Labo Motorcycle Kit.
[495:17.73]Well, at least you can use it for something.
[495:20.21]I am now mostly moistened thanks for the $1.
[495:22.13]The amount of unintentional innuendo in this dream has me baffled.
[495:24.78]It started with a simple word like rod and insert before I knew it.
[495:28.78]I was watching you grimace while furiously reeling it in, seemingly unaware of how masturbatingly it looked.
[495:34.36]This will make a great VOD.
[495:36.76]Nintendo did that.
[495:37.74]I didn't.
[495:38.12]It was like, oh, Papa Bear and Mama Bear go into each other.
[495:40.82]I didn't do that.
[495:41.42]It was them.
[495:43.12]It's time for slime.
[495:43.78]Thanks for the $5.
[495:44.55]Hey, Jerma, enjoying the stream and excited for more Labo.
[495:46.45]Inspired me to animate this.
[495:52.87]Alright, this is good.
[495:56.09]I like this.
[495:57.30]Thank you so much, slime.
[496:00.94]You get these done every stream.
[496:02.54]You just kind of bang out animations, huh?
[496:06.04]Thank you, dude, for the $5, too.
[496:08.34]Jamie, thanks for the $4.
[496:10.32]You'll be asleep by the time I see this, but I just wanted to say that this stream has been a real blast.
[496:14.66]Hope you and chat take it easy.
[496:15.82]Please take care of your cholesterol levels.
[496:17.36]I love you all.

[496:38.05]Thank you Snoozencopter for the $1.
[496:40.79]Thank you Snoozencopter again for the $1 here.
[496:45.11]You say, when you talked about your birthday, I remember that I had a dream recently where I donated 50 bucks congratulating you on your birthday.
[496:52.24]Because a lot of people in chat did.
[496:53.58]It was July.
[496:55.46]And after I sent the bit message, I noticed, wait, Jeremy's birthday isn't in July, it's September.
[496:59.62]And I know this because of the birthday scout video.
[497:03.31]So I said, that's really embarrassing.
[497:05.80]How could you not know my goddamn fucking birthday?
[497:09.84]It's in Septiembre.
[497:11.94]Thank you, Snoozycopter.
[497:12.84]Thank you, WereMassStream.

[497:27.47]Thank you.
[497:27.95]And they said, was it supposed to be a piano?
[497:29.37]Yeah, it is.
[497:30.51]It's a piano.
[497:31.44]It still exists, and I fixed it.
[497:32.82]We're fine.
[497:34.79]Hey, Tingy, thanks for the $1.
[497:35.95]Since you recommended pirate booty, does that mean you confirmed that you eat ass?
[497:41.14]No, it's a cheese popcorn thing.
[497:43.56]It's like Whole Foods.
[497:47.24]Hey, Yakutari, thanks for the $1.
[497:48.84]Late night stream that I get to catch making folding cardboard as entertaining as it will ever be.
[497:54.31]Thank you, Yakutari.

[497:58.15]Chubby Kitten, thanks for the $1.
[497:59.55]Abomination Zero, thanks for the $5.
[498:03.04]Uh, it's a GoFundMe page for me showing my nuts on Twitch.
[498:05.84]It's not gonna happen.
[498:07.04]No one will ever get that much money.
[498:08.46]Thank you, Abomination Zero, again for the $5.
[498:09.88]And he's shouting out the, the, uh... He's shouting out the link to the GoFundMe about how I'm gonna show my package on Twitch.
[498:22.97]A $10 million goal that's not gonna happen.
[498:25.83]And it's a picture of me, wicked sweaty, with a red face, eating a pizza.
[498:28.55]Alright, it's not gonna happen.
[498:29.91]No one's gonna give $10 million for that.
[498:31.77]So, uh, thank you.
[498:34.52]Thank you, Niscoi, for the $2.45.
[498:36.82]Any update on the emotes?
[498:38.72]We'll talk about the emotes on the next stream.
[498:40.63]Probably on either Wednesday or Thursday.
[498:43.95]We'll go over the emotes.
[498:46.09]Four hours.
[498:46.63]What's this?
[498:49.83]What is this?
[498:51.98]I need to see what this is.
[498:58.56]Oh, that's Samus' theme from Super Metroid 2!
[499:04.26]By the way, there is a constant loud sound in my ear.
[499:12.81]Do you want to hear what I hear right now?
