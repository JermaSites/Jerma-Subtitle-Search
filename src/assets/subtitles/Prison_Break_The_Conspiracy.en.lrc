[ve:60.16.100]

[01:13.44]hey somebody said let's see let's hear the excuse uh I I don't have one my internet just wasn't turned on apparently my business account just my comcast business just was not active I didn't even have like an IP address or anything I just there's no internet and it's back it's back it's fine
[01:39.18]There was no outage.
[01:40.50]There was no... I unplugged all my cables.
[01:42.54]I turned it off, turned it on, didn't fix it.
[01:44.04]It just randomly... Is now working now.
[01:47.14]Like, five, ten minutes ago.
[01:48.34]Alright.
[01:50.78]That's it.
[01:51.82]I don't have, like, an elaborate excuse for you.
[01:54.68]I wish I did.
[01:56.28]But I don't.
[01:57.08]Good evening.
[01:59.26]I have no excuse.
[02:00.26]But that's not an excuse!
[02:03.04]That's not an excuse.
[02:04.86]That's just a fact.
[02:07.68]Like, for instance, if I drink dirty water, it's a fact that I'm gonna get diarrhea, right?
[02:14.08]You go to, like, a pond, and you drink, like, dirty pond water, you're going to get diarrhea.
[02:20.10]That's a fact.
[02:21.44]Now, you could say that, oh, I drank the dirty pond water, therefore, I got diarrhea.
[02:28.65]That's, I mean, that's not an excuse.
[02:30.15]An excuse would be, hey, like, I missed my brother's bachelor party because I drank pond water.
[02:37.28]Well, that's what I'm saying.
[02:38.26]I didn't miss anything.
[02:44.82]Causation does not equal correlation.
[02:48.36]Yes, it does!
[02:57.78]Excuses can be facts.
[02:59.70]I don't have, just my internet didn't work.
[03:03.20]Look, you guys, listen, you guys understand that, like, to stream on twitch.tv, I have to have the internet.
[03:10.71]I can't, like, just fucking beam my eyes into the screen and, like, beam it into your brain.
[03:15.59]I need the internet to be able to do what I'm doing right now.
[03:19.32]You want causation and correlation?
[03:20.82]That's a direct fucking causation excuse correlation, okay?
[03:23.62]I'm gonna play Prison Break.
[03:30.83]I hope you're ready for this one.
[03:33.22]That's an excuse.
[03:36.25]You need the internet to stream on Twitch.
[03:38.27]I didn't have the internet.
[03:39.71]Somebody snapped my fucking brakes when I was on the highway.
[03:42.53]You know what I mean?
[03:43.47]What am I supposed to do?
[03:44.49]So if I get in a car... Hold on.
[03:48.88]Guppy, fish, or shark?
[03:51.94]No, we're going to do all normal shit.
[03:54.72]If you cut my brakes in my car...
[03:58.84]And I'm like in the mall, just hanging out.
[04:00.54]And like, you sneak over with like a mustache.
[04:02.30]You're like, you'll see.
[04:04.42]And you snip my brakes.
[04:05.92]I don't know you did that.
[04:07.38]I don't know you snip my brakes.
[04:08.70]I'm just in there.
[04:09.22]I'm at like fucking Bed Bath & Beyond.
[04:11.34]And I come outside and I get in my car.
[04:13.47]I'm going to step on the brakes and nothing's going to happen.
[04:17.27]I can't have known that that was going to happen.
[04:20.31]I need my brakes for my car to work.
[04:21.81]And I'm going to crash into a fucking wall.
[04:23.89]Is that my fault?
[04:24.59]Is that an excuse that somebody cut my brakes?
[04:27.64]No.
[04:28.12]Comcast snipped my wire.
[04:31.13]Somehow.
[04:31.65]I don't know.
[04:31.99]If you don't do shark... Always blaming the Comcast.
[04:54.71]But realistically though, what is somebody supposed to do?
[04:59.07]If you don't have internet, you can't stream.
[05:00.57]What are you supposed to do?
[05:04.47]There's nothing that can be done.
[05:09.19]Everybody quiet because a cutscene is playing.
[05:11.03]My name is Tom Paxton.
[05:12.57]I'm on an undercover mission for the company at Fox River State Penitentiary.
[05:16.38]If you're hearing this, that means I'm dead.
[05:19.08]Inmate's over the wall!
[05:20.16]Escape!
[05:20.76]Escape!
[05:27.63]What is this?
[05:28.33]We haven't even talked about what this fucking game is, by the way.
[05:32.43]This is Prison Break.
[05:34.11]The TV show.
[05:35.62]The game.
[05:42.16]And I got my magic flashlight.
[05:43.52]I'm kissing it.
[05:45.14]I thought he was kissing it.
[05:46.36]I'm not sure if I want to watch the stream.
[05:50.79]Oh, you better stick around.
[05:56.27]This is like the fucking school principal.
[05:58.42]What kind of like office is this?
[06:04.98]That's a school principal's desk.
[06:06.06]I've never seen this show.
[06:07.18]Is this the main character of the show?
[06:09.66]Why does this guy have an Irish accent?
[06:27.22]We need to know what he's up to.
[06:28.82]Secret Service?
[06:29.90]Or is the company pulling the strings?
[06:32.04]Nice fucking clay fucking clay mouth.
[06:35.25]We need to know if Schofield's gonna mess that up.
[06:37.15]These characters aren't in the show?
[06:40.73]Not much, but this has nothing to do with that.
[06:43.17]Observe and report.
[06:44.17]That's your mission.
[06:45.07]No rough stuff.
[06:46.39]Oh, he's a fucking voice president.
[06:48.97]What's my cover?
[06:49.93]Murder One.
[06:51.08]I did you a favor.
[06:52.48]Could have made a child molest him.
[06:54.50]Jesus Christ.
[06:55.84]Leave the voice recorder behind this time.
[06:59.66]Okay.
[07:04.61]So, I know that there's, like, fighting.
[07:07.59]I have to, like, fight in a prison.
[07:08.83]I gotta break out of prison.
[07:09.73]That's the premise of the whole thing.
[07:10.93]That guy was gonna get run over by the car, by the way.
[07:13.13]This bus was not stopping.
[07:15.63]This ain't summer camp, kiddies!
[07:17.41]Roll call!
[07:18.43]Fiorello!
[07:21.86]Is that me?
[07:24.48]No.
[07:24.68]That's me.
[07:29.22]Michael Scofield.
[07:29.98]6'1".
[07:30.46]July... didn't even give me a chance to see who I am.
[07:33.96]Focus tutorial.
[07:34.77]Whenever the word focus appears on the screen, you can zoom the camera in to an object of interest.
[07:39.97]You can do this by pressing R2.
[07:40.83]Look at the guard's orders.
[07:41.87]Why am I standing up?
[07:55.03]Well, you know you can stand up on the bus that's great.
[07:58.02]I focused on it apparently Alright the r2 r2 r2 I Gotta feel like this is gonna be great
[08:20.28]I play as Michael Schofield.
[08:21.88]No, I probably play as a made-up character that interacts with the guy with a phoned-in voiceover, right?
[08:30.00]He's going to say like three or four lines from the show.
[08:32.46]But I'm the new recruit.
[08:33.74]Yep.
[08:34.10]So I'm Robert Downey Jr.
[08:44.01]When did this joke come out?
[08:45.81]So do I break out of prison now?
[08:47.35]Do I just like sprint out of the line?
[08:49.01]Alright.
[09:13.90]What is the game?
[09:15.30]What is the game here?
[09:16.42]The locks on some doors can be picked.
[09:18.60]Is this gonna be, like, bully?
[09:22.03]Where I, like, run around and, like, open up lockers?
[09:27.47]And, like, give people swirlies?
[09:33.68]Okay.
[09:34.02]This show started in 2005.
[09:35.27]So we can't fuck with this guy.
[09:36.95]This is the captain.
[10:01.01]You're next, Fish.
[10:02.59]So, Fish, I picked Fish in the very beginning, right?
[10:04.49]Paxton, Thomas, 133709.
[10:08.25]You playing games, Paxton?
[10:10.35]Not me, boss.
[10:11.65]Good, because any games that go on in here, I win.
[10:14.63]Now swim along, guppy.
[10:16.34]Swim along, Fish.
[10:17.64]Make sure to press the X button to jump.
[10:20.54]Square punches, in case you didn't know.
[10:23.96]Because here comes the tutorial.
[10:25.02]When do I get to play?
[10:27.66]Wait here.
[10:31.75]Alright, here we go.
[10:32.21]Follow the guard's orders.
[10:33.47]There wasn't even any noise.
[10:48.35]I didn't even touch him.
[10:49.19]Okay, fuck.
[10:52.51]God damn it.
[10:53.87]Wait here.
[10:56.13]Is he talking to me?
[10:58.74]You can just do a haymaker, man.
[11:00.48]Why does it have to stop the whole thing?
[11:02.98]Go up the stairs.
[11:04.82]That was a successful prison escape.
[11:10.25]God damn it.
[11:12.43]Fucking come on.
[11:15.11]Alright, this is obviously we can't fuck around in this part of the game.
[11:20.37]Let's go.
[11:21.04]Come on.
[11:21.60]Just go.
[11:21.94]How do I run?
[11:22.50]What's the run button?
[11:27.76]Just follow the rules.
[11:28.54]This is the tutorial.
[11:31.66]Alright, where's my cell?
[11:40.13]It's not nice to hit people.
[11:41.37]No, it's not.
[11:44.51]I'm trying.
[11:44.83]No, this isn't.
[11:45.55]What the fuck?
[12:00.31]Hey, wait!
[12:00.71]What could they do to me?
[12:01.57]That's not fair!
[12:02.19]Hey, you gotta end this guy's game.
[12:04.33]You gotta get him back to the main menu.
[12:05.63]This is bullshit.
[12:08.82]When a QuickTime event starts, follow the instructions on the screen.
[12:11.64]You will need to press different buttons to successfully finish it.
[12:14.22]There are different sequences of button presses for each event.
[12:16.98]Okay.
[12:20.85]This one is just X.
[12:31.83]I guess that's just gonna happen.
[12:33.15]Alright.
[12:36.16]Guacamole with lard.
[12:37.74]Close it up.
[12:38.50]Who am I talking to?
[12:39.98]Am I pretending to talk into a microphone?
[12:43.34]Like I'm practicing my monologue?
[12:59.46]Imagine walking by this guy and you don't even know he's talking into like a fake microphone.
[13:09.93]He's pretending to be a news reporter.
[13:13.03]No, I know I can see the USB drive, but like the way he's holding it looks like he's holding up like an ice cream cone microphone.
[13:20.59]You think that you would like duck your head down and like go in the bed and do that?
[13:23.27]Why is he standing up holding it like in his mouth like he has a microphone in his face?
[13:30.29]Alright, let's see.
[13:31.21]Agent Tom Paxton was sent to... Yeah, I know.
[13:33.57]Hold on.
[13:34.03]Somebody's going to delay.
[13:35.87]Let me read this.
[13:37.55]Agent Tom Paxton was sent to Fox River on an undercover assignment for the company, the organization that framed Burroughs for the death of the vice president's brother.
[13:45.84]His mission is to find out what Schofield and Burroughs are up to and make sure Burroughs dies in the electric chair as scheduled.
[13:53.35]I don't know any of these people.
[13:59.93]I'm supposed to know those names by now, and I don't.
[14:01.87]We get two achievements in two minutes.
[14:05.29]That's good.
[14:07.95]Have you even watched the show?
[14:10.06]No, I never watched Prison Break.
[14:18.00]That wasn't part of the investigation.
[14:21.50]That was just a personal note of mine.
[14:23.88]He looks a little weird.
[14:27.83]Focus.
[14:29.59]Inmates that can be fought appear on the map.
[14:34.42]This guy can be fought.
[14:36.20]How do I, like, get down there?
[14:38.16]Go get him.
[14:42.78]Why am I walking down here?
[14:46.84]There are inmates that can... What about this fat guy?
[14:51.80]Okay, apparently you can't fight anyone unless they're, like, a specific person that you can fight.
[15:00.46]So that's great.
[15:01.16]I just look like a psycho.
[15:02.58]That's cool.
[15:04.14]That's a big boo right there.
[15:06.19]This guy, which guy can be fought?
[15:07.79]This guy?
[15:08.11]Alright, that was a cop.
[15:10.19]Doesn't matter.
[15:11.09]I just have to fight this guy.
[15:14.62]This guy right here.
[15:16.74]Oh, jeez.
[15:26.83]I didn't expect that to work.
[15:28.96]I didn't expect that to work.
[15:32.02]I don't think I was supposed to fight this guy.
[15:38.58]Block by holding R1.
[15:39.98]Pressing block at the right time will give you a chance to reverse the enemy's attack.
[15:43.43]Causing more damage than a normal attack.
[15:45.11]Kick downed inmates.
[15:46.87]Okay, let's go like this.
[15:48.33]Oh, there we go.
[15:52.97]What the fuck was that?
[16:20.95]What is he doing he's doing like wrestling moves oh What the hell man alright how you know what I could see it you win I
[16:40.24]Nice punch!
[16:43.74]Reverse it!
[16:49.31]Get it!
[16:54.05]I can't... I need to reverse something.
[16:59.49]No!
[16:59.85]Get up!
[17:04.80]There it is.
[17:05.30]Reverse.
[17:08.84]When do you... When do you win a fucking fight?
[17:13.68]How do you win a fight?
[17:15.96]Is it over?
[17:16.34]Oh, no.
[17:19.23]Alright, I scoop slammed him.
[17:20.29]That means I win, right?
[17:21.19]Okay.
[17:25.75]What was the point of that?
[17:26.37]I don't understand.
[17:32.57]That's it.
[17:34.25]Do you, like, level up?
[17:34.95]Do you get, like, experience?
[17:39.28]I'm just fighting his friend!
[17:40.81]Nothing changed!
[17:42.65]Wait, hold on a second, I don't understand.
[17:46.31]I don't think... Alright, well this guy, again, this guy was easier.
[17:57.92]Okay.
[18:01.74]I guess, so there's no reason to fight anybody.
[18:05.21]So why can't I fight anybody else?
[18:07.79]Oh, wait, hold on.
[18:08.75]Was I supposed to go over here the whole time?
[18:18.81]I don't think so.
[18:19.37]I think this is just here for no reason.
[18:31.31]Oh, come on.
[18:32.07]One punch?
[18:32.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18:33.62]Excuse me.
[18:34.20]Excuse me.
[18:34.78]Excuse me.
[18:36.02]The other guys had honor, okay?
[18:38.70]Do you have no honor?
[18:40.48]Look at these guys.
[18:41.88]Not a fucking single shred of honor.
[18:44.66]I'm 3v1ing right now.
[18:50.28]Get out of here.
[18:50.82]Alright, I gotta, I gotta, like, here we go.
[19:00.34]Reverse.
[19:05.89]Fucking hit him.
[19:06.71]God damn it.
[19:12.67]There it is.
[19:13.55]Alright.
[19:14.57]Can I move on please?
[19:15.45]I need to do the rest of the game.
[19:19.51]Wait till he gets up.
[19:21.93]Just every time he gets up.
[19:24.51]Just haymaker him every single time.
[19:26.15]Until I eventually kill him.
[19:31.99]God damn it.
[19:32.53]No, no, no, no.
[19:33.23]Can I turn around and run?
[19:34.96]I don't want to fight all these guys.
[19:39.31]Is there like a, I concede button?
[19:47.13]Oh my god, I fucking swear to god, just end me please.
[19:55.47]Wait, if I watch the show, I get the secret code?
[19:59.85]I said, what else does it want me to do?
[20:00.87]It's like, hey, go punch random people.
[20:02.85]Alright, we did that.
[20:06.82]There's an X on my mini-map.
[20:08.08]I'm not sure what that's for.
[20:10.50]Wish I could just pick that guy up.
[20:12.26]But wish I could just push that guy over the balcony.
[20:13.80]You know what I mean?
[20:14.45]Just like... Anyways, thank you Huffle for the bits.
[20:24.11]Satan's Weed Whacker for the bits.
[20:25.73]Huffle again.
[20:27.35]The only causation and correlation I'm seeing are between your internet being down and streaming sucks.
[20:33.68]Our streamers sucks.
[20:35.88]Hey, come on.
[20:38.00]Thank you, though.
[20:41.64]Satan's Weebacker.
[20:42.42]Jerm, we made it away from the hurricane safely and I'm back home now.
[20:45.75]Damage was minimal.
[20:47.25]I have a cold, though.
[20:49.25]Well, I'm glad that you're safe.
[20:53.37]I am.
[20:54.83]It's a terrible, terrible fucking disaster.
[20:57.19]So, stay safe, guys.
[21:00.91]Gary Gray.
[21:01.98]Thank you for the $1.
[21:02.64]Jerm is 9'85".
[21:03.04]Tallest streamer I know.
[21:07.78]Is it this easy to get out of jail?
[21:10.86]What?
[21:13.66]Am I going to win the game?
[21:15.64]I just escaped prison.
[21:18.17]That just said exit.
[21:19.67]I just win, right?
[21:22.35]That's it.
[21:22.89]That's how the season ended.
[21:28.81]Muse, thank you for the $5.
[21:29.91]Here you go.
[21:30.27]I hope it's enough to pay your Comcast bill.
[21:33.99]Oh, that's just to the main yard.
[21:37.03]Thank you, Muse.
[21:38.19]There has to be a sprint, right?
[21:38.89]I mean, there's a sneak.
[21:39.41]Why would there not be a sprint?
[21:40.29]Do I have to lift weights to show how cool I am?
[21:57.64]Why would he take me seriously?
[21:58.72]I just look like I'm fucking two feet tall.
[22:01.18]Yeah.
[22:01.40]Gotta fight another guy.
[22:28.06]Mm-hmm.
[22:28.72]Wait, what do you mean the shoe?
[22:32.18]Make teabag angry.
[22:36.84]That's teabag.
[22:38.82]Bagwell.
[22:39.36]Theodore Bagwell.
[22:40.88]Six counts of kidnapping and... Alright, well, that was gone in a second.
[22:46.49]Okay, finally I can learn how to run.
[22:47.99]Running makes more noise.
[22:49.45]Who cares?
[22:49.87]We're in prison.
[22:52.90]We're literally in prison.
[22:54.06]Who cares?
[22:54.49]Which one is he?
[22:54.89]Where's Buff Bagwell?
[22:55.37]This guy right here, right?
[22:56.01]Buff Bagwell is fucking invisible.
[22:57.07]I can't hurt him.
[22:57.43]Alright, we'll sneak attack him.
[23:23.60]He turned back.
[23:24.36]Oh, man.
[23:24.98]I go my own way.
[23:26.25]In cigarettes.
[23:26.79]Yep.
[23:26.89]But I'll give you three cigarettes.
[23:28.43]Oh, no.
[23:28.61]Come on.
[23:29.09]Don't... Oh, yeah.
[23:29.73]I don't have it.
[23:30.65]I don't have it in me, right?
[23:55.01]And maybe I don't.
[23:57.96]This whole game is a series of reversing people and punching other people.
[24:01.12]Alright, I did it.
[24:09.46]Thanks a lot.
[24:09.80]You did a good job.
[24:10.56]Your first mission is complete.
[24:25.17]Alright, so the shoe is... Why am I playing as this character now?
[24:30.03]What's going on?
[24:30.43]Okay.
[24:30.91]I don't have to fight this guy too, right?
[24:32.83]Do I have to fight this guy?
[24:33.85]Oh my god.
[24:52.51]This game is just punching.
[24:53.85]There's nothing else in this game.
[24:54.97]You'd think I would like this game because it's about just punching people.
[25:00.59]This is how you train.
[25:04.25]Listen to the instructions carefully and execute the moves as fast as possible.
[25:10.19]What?
[25:11.89]I didn't... What are you talking about?
[25:13.37]Oh, okay.
[25:16.71]Hold on.
[25:18.95]He didn't even give me a chance.
[25:23.78]You don't just say miss.
[25:24.96]I didn't even swing my hand.
[25:26.24]There we go.
[25:35.35]You can't say I missed if I didn't swing.
[25:36.89]That doesn't make any sense.
[25:41.13]This just turns into Parappa the Rapper.
[25:42.57]That's great.
[25:45.93]Give me chop.
[25:47.19]How much longer do I have to do this for?
[25:50.82]Do I learn any new moves?
[25:56.10]Yeah, but this is not a boxing course.
[25:58.91]If you've ever been to a boxing class, they don't just tell you to throw a punch as hard as you can into a bag every, like, eight seconds.
[26:06.07]Punch it!
[26:09.23]He's not teaching me any techniques.
[26:13.49]This is the guy you use to train the people?
[26:16.40]When can this be done?
[26:18.14]Come on!
[26:23.14]Can I leave?
[26:25.40]When is this guy going to be satisfied?
[26:33.42]When can I be done with this?
[26:41.84]God damn it.
[26:45.94]Okay, now I've got to lift weights.
[26:49.11]tap triangle to lift the weight all the way up and lower it slowly balancing the weight with left and right alright wait I okay tap I'm gonna drop this on my neck easy what am I supposed to do I need to balance it in the right spot
[27:21.49]This is not healthy.
[27:23.58]This is not the correct healthy way to lift weights at the gym.
[27:32.02]If I saw a guy doing this, I would rush to help him.
[27:34.43]You know what I mean?
[27:34.89]Because he obviously has no fucking idea what's going on.
[27:40.51]It's like, sir, sir, sir, sir.
[27:42.01]I would do that.
[27:43.00]I'd be like, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir.
[27:53.29]Whatever.
[27:55.31]Okay, I'm done.
[27:56.29]That was fun.
[27:57.79]Exit, please.
[27:59.32]Hold on.
[28:00.44]Hold on.
[28:01.38]He lifted... Do you see how easily he just pushed it up there?
[28:04.32]Was I pretending?
[28:07.56]I was just faking that out.
[28:09.49]I was pretending to lift those weights.
[28:13.21]Okay.
[28:16.75]Alright, who am I going to talk to?
[28:18.01]To be in on the punching fight.
[28:19.83]Yep.
[28:20.71]I'll give it a shot.
[28:21.43]Are we talking about Tylenol?
[28:24.57]Advil?
[28:24.96]Is that knives?
[28:25.74]Okay.
[28:25.94]Yeah, use my key card.
[28:47.69]This door was very clearly locked.
[28:52.66]Get into the boiler room.
[28:59.68]Okay.
[29:00.54]We got our first real mission.
[29:01.88]Peak.
[29:02.30]Are there people down in the boiler room?
[29:17.22]As soon as Paxton enters an area that is off limits, the game switches to stealth mode.
[29:21.57]Take cover with circle and hide behind objects.
[29:24.07]Take cover behind the boilers and jump across the lit area without being detected by the maintenance guy.
[29:30.99]That's who I'm worried about, the maintenance guy.
[29:37.90]They made that sound very dangerous.
[29:44.95]It's just a couple of guys like sweeping floors, like what's the worst that could happen?
[29:49.61]Well done, now try to sneak behind the janitor and climb up the ledge.
[29:52.37]Don't make any noise.
[29:59.00]What?
[29:59.78]Oh.
[30:11.87]That's all that happens.
[30:12.63]I was trying to, like, snap his neck.
[30:14.72]Oh my god.
[30:16.00]Okay, so you can't- It's one of those games where you can't fucking fail anything.
[30:19.08]I have to just do, like, the dive over here.
[30:21.32]Look at that.
[30:21.78]Cool.
[30:22.06]He didn't see me.
[30:22.84]Yes, he did.
[30:23.90]Yeah, he did.
[30:24.26]He was, like, fucking picking out his tuna can.
[30:26.27]Okay, let's go.
[30:29.31]Let's just do this.
[30:30.95]This isn't Hitman.
[30:31.89]I know.
[30:32.49]I know.
[30:32.73]And I'm playing it like Hitman.
[30:33.83]I don't know why.
[30:34.91]Alright, good.
[30:36.51]Turn.
[30:38.06]Okay.
[30:38.20]Okay.
[30:40.62]Nice.
[30:40.96]Alright.
[30:41.62]Yep.
[30:43.80]Get down there.
[30:44.42]Sneak.
[30:47.58]Just sneak by him.
[30:50.26]Get up there.
[30:56.23]What if I grabbed a broom and started doing the broom too?
[30:59.37]How do I need to go over here?
[31:00.37]Is there like a jump?
[31:04.49]I feel like he's going to see me if I go over here.
[31:12.59]Where does it want me to go?
[31:14.65]Like over here?
[31:24.00]I don't understand.
[31:24.62]Do I have to go to that ledge and jump on it?
[31:31.77]Sneak by the dangerous janitor.
[31:38.40]I guess I just don't... Where... Where did it want me to go?
[31:42.65]Why is it aiming up here?
[31:46.31]I didn't hold R2 long enough.
[31:48.29]That's what it was.
[31:50.25]I was supposed to hold R2 longer and it showed me everything.
[31:53.79]Not just the fucking mouse hole in the ceiling.
[32:04.05]At least this is easy.
[32:06.31]Do I need to sneak anymore or can I just climb?
[32:10.97]Stalker.
[32:11.59]Yeah, good achievement.
[32:14.07]I did it.
[32:14.45]Oh, there it is.
[32:20.86]There's the secret stash being guarded by the janitors.
[32:28.57]Yeah, go get my stash, man.
[32:29.85]It's so secret.
[32:32.89]But be careful of those dangerous janitors.
[32:41.38]Where do I need to go?
[32:41.90]Am I going to tightrope walk this?
[32:55.25]There's no way they would put this on the top of the aggro crag.
[33:03.33]Okay, there's one police officer here.
[33:07.20]I guess it makes sense.
[33:07.96]Sure.
[33:08.50]Okay, hang down and drop.
[33:15.25]And drop.
[33:18.45]Get the stash.
[33:20.31]And then get out unseen.
[33:21.69]Climb onto the catwalk.
[33:30.13]This is not a catwalk.
[33:37.27]This is like the bars at a kid's playground.
[33:41.93]This is not a catwalk.
[33:51.74]Exit the boiler room.
[33:52.54]Do I still have to sneak?
[33:55.85]Is this a door?
[33:59.43]Where the hell are you making me look?
[34:04.43]What?
[34:08.05]Didn't I just come from over here?
[34:10.95]I'm going to jump up here?
[34:11.85]I wasn't going to go... What am I going to do?
[34:25.00]There's no way a fucking human can do that.
[34:28.30]No, alright.
[34:28.74]Watch out for the fucking janitor.
[34:30.48]He will see me.
[34:31.27]I gotta sneak by this.
[34:32.35]You earned the achievement monkey.
[34:35.73]There's no more guy, right?
[34:36.65]Alright, nice.
[34:38.35]We did it.
[34:39.49]Congratulations.
[34:41.69]Time to go get ourselves another fist fight.
[34:44.10]Can't wait.
[34:47.46]That just scared the shit out of me.
[34:50.84]Okay.
[34:54.80]Time to fight.
[34:55.20]I'm gonna get a tattoo right on my face.
[34:56.80]Uh, working out.
[34:57.10]By punching the heavy bag or lifting weights, you will gain strength, which will give you an upper hand in fights.
[35:01.88]I think I already am.
[35:03.38]I think I already am, like, tough though, right?
[35:22.96]Do you lose tough over time?
[35:25.34]Or do you stick with tough?
[35:26.56]Yeah, I got plenty of tough.
[35:28.38]I'm fine.
[35:32.62]Let's go find... He's playing basketball?
[35:38.08]There he is.
[35:38.42]I got another cutscene.
[35:46.51]Lincoln Burroughs.
[35:47.33]This guy has to go to the electric chair, right?
[35:49.75]That's the whole point of this game.
[35:54.00]Michael, what the hell are you doing here?
[35:57.16]Roll it up, Burroughs.
[35:59.18]I'm breaking you out, Link.
[36:01.18]Impossible.
[36:03.24]Not if you design the place.
[36:04.59]I'm supposed to break out.
[36:05.39]First, I gotta get into prison industries.
[36:09.03]Burroughs, I said move your ass!
[36:13.43]Prison break.
[36:15.54]Schofield's planning a prison break.
[36:17.36]No details yet.
[36:18.24]He said it.
[36:18.62]I gotta tell Mannix.
[36:21.98]I gotta use my phone call.
[36:23.86]I gotta use my one phone call.
[36:30.35]Yeah, hello?
[36:31.27]Uh, they're planning to get out of the front of your escape.
[36:33.29]I'm a, I'm a, I'm an undercover police officer.
[36:38.78]I feel like we're just watching the show.
[36:40.92]Yeah, that's insta-snitch.
[36:42.84]Insta-snitch.
[36:44.31]I found out that information and instantly snitched on him.
[36:48.21]Like, I couldn't have, like, talked to him and been like, hey, dude, I'm gonna, like, snitch on you.
[37:08.39]No, that's a bad idea.
[37:09.99]Why would you ever tell a criminal that you're going to snitch on them?
[37:14.19]That's a bad idea.
[37:15.01]Like, hey, by the way, dude, I'm going to snitch on you in like 10 minutes.
[37:18.36]It's like, okay, well, you're dead.
[37:22.44]Charles Westmoreland, I know you.
[37:25.81]I knew your wife before she passed.
[37:28.37]You knew Marla?
[37:29.83]You mean Ann.
[37:30.95]How'd you know her?
[37:32.27]I was the janitor in her school.
[37:34.11]Janitor.
[37:35.93]I was the janitor.
[37:37.23]Okay, no more tests.
[37:38.59]You want to learn the ropes?
[37:39.64]Look around.
[37:40.58]Trey Street Deuce has got hoops.
[37:42.48]Nartenio's got handball.
[37:44.32]Wood's got the weight pile.
[37:46.12]Then there's Bellic and his boys.
[37:48.06]Dirtiest gang in the whole place.
[37:50.22]Only difference between us and them is the badge.
[37:54.78]So, do I have to, like, play sports and get, like, people to like me?
[37:59.03]I don't want to go run around and talk.
[38:01.77]I want to do things.
[38:03.13]Wait, that's the guy from Until Dawn.
[38:05.09]Why is this guy always in a video game?
[38:21.02]right this guy is just always like his face is computer generated in a video game like in like 50 video games here he is are we seeing like the season one finale I'm going to help him he's hitting him with like a chicken wing
[38:51.99]Watch out.
[38:52.35]Yeah, beat him with a big turkey leg.
[38:53.93]What?
[38:58.45]What is this fucking transition?
[39:01.08]Hit the iron pile to gain strength.
[39:23.34]Okay.
[39:25.26]Am I back in the cells now?
[39:31.96]I'm going to talk to a bruisey.
[39:34.13]I don't even know who said that, but I don't care.
[39:42.43]Pardon me.
[39:43.09]Here he comes.
[39:44.09]He's going to talk like this.
[39:45.67]He's going to say, you are fucking stupid.
[39:48.15]I'm going to talk like this.
[39:49.13]Here he comes.
[39:52.57]Who the hell are you?
[39:54.41]Someone who needs a favor.
[39:56.80]Funny.
[39:57.76]That fish Schofield just asked me the same thing.
[40:01.18]Beat it.
[40:01.94]I don't do favors.
[40:03.68]I love this guy's accent.
[40:04.96]Peter Stormare.
[40:07.78]Let's see if you can swim, fish.
[40:10.32]One of my guy's teats I hear is turning rat.
[40:13.62]But I gotta know for sure before I exterminate him.
[40:17.35]This guy's in the show.
[40:25.64]Was Peter Stormare actually in this show?
[40:27.58]Or did they just video game at him?
[40:33.62]He was in the show.
[40:37.16]I kind of want to watch the show.
[40:40.61]How bad is this show?
[40:43.19]On a scale of 1 to 10, how terrible is this show?
[40:48.19]10 being terrible, like one being like terrible.
[40:51.21]You know what I mean?
[40:56.98]The security is real bad by the way.
[40:58.86]Yeah, here comes the sneaking music.
[41:01.81]Hiding in the closet tutorial.
[41:06.25]What?
[41:08.47]You can't fit in there.
[41:17.77]Was this turning into amnesia?
[41:19.51]Which guy is that?
[41:20.17]Which one is that?
[41:23.35]I think this guy's just getting a drink.
[41:24.39]No?
[41:24.47]Try to get out.
[41:25.45]God damn it.
[41:26.09]I like thought I could sit there and look at it.
[41:28.49]Thank God it's right here.
[41:29.45]Can I hide?
[41:29.71]Hide in the room.
[41:30.15]Okay, fucking let's go.
[41:49.44]I thought I could just sit there and just pee in the room.
[41:54.00]Oh, you guys are gonna get fucking snitched on immediately.
[41:59.12]Talk to me.
[42:00.26]A brutesy's still running his family from the inside.
[42:03.30]He gets coded letters about the weekly takes, the big scores.
[42:07.10]I can tell you what they mean.
[42:08.49]Hand it over.
[42:09.39]I'll squeeze our brutesy like a fat chick's ass.
[42:12.73]So, still good here?
[42:14.63]As long as you keep feeding me the good stuff, ain't nothing gonna happen to you.
[42:19.37]Is that a firefighter?
[42:22.43]That guy has, like, the fireman patch, doesn't he?
[42:24.99]Oh, no, okay, there's the patch.
[42:29.03]What am I... I can't clearly see.
[42:34.01]Yeah, it's alright.
[42:35.39]You know, the meeting is over, so, I mean, I don't care anymore.
[42:39.71]The meeting is done.
[42:42.81]Stuff.
[42:50.03]Let's move on.
[42:50.59]No!
[43:02.14]No, I don't wanna do this again.
[43:03.56]He's like, I see you.
[43:13.56]Why?
[43:14.65]This game is terrible.
[43:15.45]We got a little more time before we get next to this game.
[43:18.29]There's a little bit more time.
[43:19.53]We got a lot of games to go through.
[43:20.95]He just bumped into the fucking wall.
[43:21.87]That guy went the wrong way.
[43:43.01]I'm pushing my... Okay, for a second I thought he was vaping.
[43:48.62]I don't know why.
[43:52.06]I thought this guy was, like, hitting a fucking vape machine.
[43:54.84]Alright, I gotta sneak.
[43:56.85]Because we can't let this guy see us.
[43:58.11]Alright, easy.
[44:04.61]Don't fuck this up.
[44:09.28]How am I not... How am I gonna get by this guy?
[44:12.79]That's a guard, right?
[44:13.43]Is that a guard or is that a prisoner?
[44:14.43]What?
[44:17.45]We're good.
[44:17.96]Am I supposed to tail this guy?
[44:23.44]Yeah, I was supposed to be tailing this guy, I think.
[44:40.90]Unscrewing tutorial.
[44:42.10]Paxton can remove certain screws to gain access to some shafts in other areas.
[44:47.17]Press X and use the left nipple to unscrew.
[44:51.19]Be careful, though.
[44:51.89]The faster you unscrew, the more noise you make.
[44:54.33]And there's a fucking sledgehammer.
[44:57.20]Come on.
[44:57.66]You're not going to do this to me.
[44:58.74]You're not going to show me all these fucking melee weapons.
[45:00.80]Let me take one of them.
[45:03.38]Oh, that sucks.
[45:05.85]Alright, let's unscrew.
[45:10.73]Literally going as fucking fast as I can.
[45:12.67]It doesn't even matter.
[45:21.56]Don't enable chat.
[45:24.40]Get to Bellic's office.
[45:25.44]Alright.
[45:29.48]I don't think that's how that works, but okay.
[45:32.18]I love how they just scream out all the things.
[45:37.79]Okay, I gotta hide then.
[45:38.73]He's doing a stairwell check.
[45:42.52]Here he comes.
[45:47.94]Oh, my God.
[45:52.94]This is just Hitman, but I can't escape on my own terms.
[46:04.65]How long is it taking to do it?
[46:05.51]Oh, what is he doing?
[46:06.11]Getting a coffee?
[46:06.61]Alright, go.
[46:07.03]Get out of here.
[46:08.49]Where did that guy go?
[46:08.99]Alright, we're good.
[46:10.49]Go.
[46:15.46]Here's the main building.
[46:17.96]We gotta go up here, apparently.
[46:21.20]Do I have to unscrew this?
[46:23.14]No.
[46:25.34]Where the hell am I?
[46:31.65]Get some coffee for myself?
[46:32.73]I actually would.
[46:33.37]Now we get... We get, like, Metal Gear Solid-style hones.
[46:38.59]Hey, Louie.
[46:39.91]How are you?
[46:41.16]Easy like a truck stop hooker.
[46:43.33]can I help you with something that's uh my uniform pants are getting kind of tight we can't have our officers I think that's the same actor that is that's what I was thinking it's a security matter I think that's lee from walking I'll see what I can do sounds similar what the hell's going on
[47:12.30]I just, like, fucking fell through the... I was wondering... I forgot about the QTEs, alright?
[47:17.54]I forgot.
[47:21.05]I think that just... Oh.
[47:25.07]They're about to, like, do it down here.
[47:27.83]Don't even tell me.
[47:28.39]What?
[47:30.05]Is that me doing that?
[47:33.32]What?
[47:42.62]What a clumsy fuck.
[47:45.09]He's so clumsy.
[47:48.53]That's so funny.
[47:50.31]Why would you go upside down with this?
[47:56.31]We're gonna get... God.
[48:00.18]We're gonna get... God.
[48:02.72]It's too much for me.
[48:03.66]And it made me press a fucking... Look at this.
[48:05.30]Watch.
[48:05.50]See?
[48:05.64]It made me press circle wicked quick.
[48:07.60]Right here, I am the warden.
[48:11.89]God!
[48:13.19]Alright, get up into the attic.
[48:22.82]The attic.
[48:26.64]Yeah, you know what?
[48:27.62]You guys are gonna get caught.
[48:29.90]By me.
[48:31.79]Oh, damn it.
[48:32.69]I can't.
[48:42.74]Okay, they're just talking.
[48:44.96]They're just talking, guys.
[48:46.74]Look, I may have stayed there for an extended period.
[48:48.78]What am I doing?
[48:49.52]I want to, like, see that happen.
[48:52.81]I got to basically, like, look through the blinds.
[49:01.59]Go.
[49:02.07]Get in there quick.
[49:04.13]Woo!
[49:05.25]Woo!
[49:07.01]Woo!
[49:08.07]We're good.
[49:10.73]Camera tutorial.
[49:11.37]Be careful.
[49:11.71]This is a security camera I had.
[49:13.33]Watch its movement and stay out of its sight.
[49:14.91]If you are underneath it, you can tip it off to throw it off.
[49:19.55]Tip it up to throw it.
[49:20.37]Okay.
[49:20.63]I was like, what does that even mean?
[49:23.90]So watch out for the camera.
[49:24.88]I can go underneath it.
[49:26.98]And I can go underneath and tip it.
[49:30.12]It's that easy.
[49:30.88]I got seen.
[49:31.44]I got seen by that camera.
[49:35.30]I just jumped up and made it easier for the camera to see me.
[49:38.00]That's all that happened there.
[49:43.12]Where am I going?
[49:43.56]Climbing?
[49:43.86]No, no, no.
[49:44.94]Get back up there.
[49:45.62]What are you, stupid?
[49:49.98]What are you, some kind of idiot?
[49:51.92]Wait, why can't I... Hold on.
[49:54.16]Stop that.
[49:54.80]Get over here.
[49:55.44]Twitch.
[49:55.90]Okay.
[49:58.83]It's so dark in here.
[50:04.45]What the hell is going on?
[50:08.03]Oh, get in there.
[50:13.61]How did I end up in the chimney?
[50:19.49]What the fuck is going on right now?
[50:26.59]Oh, actually climbing up this?
[50:32.48]Okay.
[50:34.26]We're going reverse Santa Claus now.
[50:35.78]That's good.
[50:37.64]I can stop sneaking.
[50:40.24]Climb down the elevator.
[50:48.36]Look at this shit.
[50:49.06]Alright, here we go.
[50:50.56]You guys ready?
[50:53.33]Prince of Persia.
[50:56.49]There it is.
[51:05.66]Did it.
[51:07.46]What?
[51:12.66]That was so fast.
[51:15.56]Oh no, it's gonna crush me!
[51:16.84]I better get out, quick!
[51:24.65]I wish it- Okay, you know like the wasted thing that happens in GTA now?
[51:29.65]I wish like I didn't get the wasted.
[51:31.27]Wait, what?
[51:33.28]What the fuck just happened?
[51:34.58]What just happened to my- What the- I have no idea what just happened.
[51:40.38]I went back in here.
[51:41.48]Why did I go back in here?
[51:46.96]Was that the same guy that was going to see me before?
[51:48.86]That's like the I see you guy.
[51:50.24]He almost saw me.
[51:56.65]Get out of the cellar.
[52:03.83]There was a copy of it.
[52:04.59]I just dove back in the elevator shaft.
[52:10.51]Doesn't seem like smart.
[52:11.69]What?
[52:15.44]That guy wasn't even on the mini-map yet.
[52:18.04]Gotta hide in a kid's locker.
[52:23.93]Where are you?
[52:27.75]Oh, where could I get... God dammit.
[52:35.31]Just let him walk by and I'll just go by.
[52:37.05]I got seen by one of the drainpipes.
[52:47.10]One thing I do love about this game is how when somebody's close, they make sure to let you know how close they are.
[52:51.95]The guy, like, clears his throat.
[52:54.03]He'll make a noise.
[52:55.05]He'll be like, just in case somebody was around to know.
[53:00.21]Or, hey, check out those stairs for some guy.
[53:05.42]They don't make it difficult.
[53:08.14]And, of course, now he starts moving, right?
[53:11.14]Walk down that hall.
[53:11.84]What are you doing?
[53:14.00]Can I, like, sneak up this or something?
[53:23.10]Check the vent.
[53:29.91]There's no way to go over here.
[53:30.79]It's all empty.
[53:36.69]Is there, like, a vent?
[53:38.75]No, there's no vent.
[53:41.29]Oh, there he goes.
[53:41.67]You see?
[53:41.97]He left.
[53:42.23]He left.
[53:43.43]Why did it take him so long to do that before?
[53:44.65]And he's coming down this way.
[53:46.41]Oh, fuck you.
[53:47.27]Fuck.
[53:50.88]Alright.
[53:51.46]Well, we didn't get spotted.
[53:55.14]Somehow.
[53:56.44]Which way is he going?
[54:03.13]He walked right by me and shined a flashlight in my face.
[54:07.19]I guess we didn't get seen by that.
[54:12.75]Return to the X-Wing.
[54:19.16]This mission really...
[54:23.85]My god Why oh my god, dude Why are they just guys just uh, I just told me that Son of a bitch Well, I have to hide in here now
[54:50.82]Come on, walk down and walk by.
[54:53.22]You know, you have to go in here for his dumb AI to understand to move over here.
[54:59.18]And we're good.
[55:04.65]Don't see me through the grate.
[55:06.39]Turn this way and come back.
[55:10.83]He's just staring over here.
[55:11.63]Come on.
[55:13.23]Turn your body around.
[55:13.95]Turn around.
[55:17.84]Turn around.
[55:19.93]Turn around.
[55:21.43]There's nothing there.
[55:24.75]Don't be like the guy from the bunker.
[55:27.10]That gif from the bunker.
[55:28.16]I don't know.
[55:30.46]I'm going to have to jump.
[55:33.14]Once it goes down to the left.
[55:34.92]Go.
[55:36.60]Did it.
[55:36.82]Alright.
[55:46.44]Stand up and get out of here.
[55:48.57]This time, I'm not going to just barrel up the stairs.
[55:53.17]I'm going to wait.
[55:55.17]A guy comes down the stairs.
[55:57.47]How would I ever know that that was going to be a thing?
[55:59.55]Because he wasn't on the mini-map.
[56:02.07]So when does he come down?
[56:05.09]Why can't I make noise?
[56:06.07]Why can't I, like, make, like, a cough?
[56:08.36]Shit, here he comes.
[56:08.84]Oh, fuck.
[56:12.78]You know in Metal Gear Solid when you can do that shit?
[56:16.16]You can, like, tap on the wall and stuff.
[56:20.50]Where is he?
[56:23.98]Where is he?
[56:30.68]Hide under the stairs?
[56:31.40]That's what I just did.
[56:32.38]Why doesn't he come down?
[56:38.57]I can't walk through here.
[56:45.49]Where is he?
[56:46.29]Is this freaking me out?
[56:47.13]This is actually scaring me a little.
[56:51.55]I see the light.
[56:56.51]There he is.
[56:56.93]Why can't I?
[56:59.59]I can't karate chop these guys in the back of the head.
[57:02.46]Why?
[57:10.69]Does he move?
[57:16.55]I don't think this guy moves.
[57:41.63]Okay.
[57:41.99]Well, that was... That was... This guy in the vent just sitting there with a flashlight.
[57:58.54]That'd be so funny.
[58:00.26]Thank you, Mr. Snake Man, for the 10 bucks.
[58:03.14]Remember my lessons, Jerma.
[58:05.66]I will.
[58:06.43]I will take your lessons very, very, very strongly, Mr. Snake Man.
[58:09.83]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[58:11.95]Uh, Lazer, thanks for the bits, may the yellow things light your path.
[58:16.79]Are you talking about the blips?
[58:18.17]Like the yellow X's?
[58:20.51]Anyways, thank you.
[58:21.33]Uh, Haru, thank you Haru for the bits, just out of curiosity.
[58:24.41]If you like games about punching people, have you tried the Yakuza series?
[58:27.56]Actually, yes.
[58:29.76]Actually, yes.
[58:32.14]Did... I thought I did.
[58:33.62]That's how I say thank you.
[58:40.23]Wait, did he say showers?
[58:44.99]He did.
[58:46.83]No, this is not going to be like a shower naked.
[58:49.03]You spied on me, bastard!
[58:51.13]Now you die!
[58:52.85]What?
[58:53.15]In the shower?
[58:53.71]What are you talking about?
[58:55.27]I'm not spying on you in the shower.
[58:56.53]I'm meeting somebody here.
[58:58.33]Don't be so full of yourself.
[59:00.73]You came in to look at me naked even though all my clothes are on?
[59:09.46]Alright, now fucking break his neck.
[59:16.39]What a shitty wrestling move.
[59:22.71]No blood in this game.
[59:23.83]Gotta be rated PG-13, right?
[59:26.17]Hey, the show was on like a network television show.
[59:28.79]Can't show anything besides like fucking spit, right?
[59:39.91]What was the point of all that, by the way?
[59:42.05]Was I supposed to do something there?
[59:50.21]Wait, that... Hold on, that was... That's supposed to be blood.
[60:02.64]Oh no, he stabbed me in the neck.
[60:04.62]He slit my throat and I like sweated a little bit.
[60:08.24]Watch this shit.
[60:08.94]I want to see this again.
[60:10.53]This dude stabs me in the chest and then slits my fucking throat.
[60:13.93]And I spit out a little bit of saliva.
[60:20.45]We're not even fucking... We're not even fucking humans.
[60:25.40]I backed out of that.
[60:26.14]This clearly was backing up.
[60:27.66]Alright, do I slit his throat?
[60:31.34]By the way, look at the knife.
[60:32.72]The knife has to...
[60:36.78]The knife has blood on it.
[60:40.40]And it is a vegetable slicer.
[60:45.42]This guy got a hold of a vegetable slicer somehow.
[60:51.65]He's like, no, come on.
[60:53.99]Hold on, is he going to stick it in my neck?
[60:58.13]No, he just punched him.
[61:02.56]Oh, I love this game.
[61:06.89]I have a carrot feeling.
[61:09.49]Alright, here's my... I'm gonna take you guys to... Look, it's kinda hard because it switches so quickly between these two and I have to tap them.
[61:17.37]So if I press the wrong one... Alright, do I stab him?
[61:22.41]Jam that in his chest.
[61:29.27]I hope he gets up again.
[61:34.23]Nope.
[61:34.99]Apparently not.
[61:39.88]That's so funny.
[61:41.86]I love the fact that there's no blood, no matter what.
[61:45.90]Even when getting your throat cut.
[61:48.24]Teets was selling you out, John.
[61:51.10]I'll kill that traitor.
[61:52.74]I already did.
[61:53.26]He's not going to be talking for a long time.
[61:57.16]You've earned your way into PI, my friend.
[62:01.51]You're now a private investigator.
[62:04.45]I made it into PI.
[62:06.19]Now I can keep an eye on Scofield and figure out what it's up to.
[62:11.29]I swear to God, I'm not a plant, guys.
[62:14.17]Let me walk away from you and stand in the middle and just tell everybody my plan into a microphone.
[62:20.07]What a terrible fucking undercover agent.
[62:31.63]Very clearly, everyone stopped to look at me, too.
[62:38.05]On next week's episode of Prison Break...
[62:42.58]I tell you to fucking kill somebody and you just did not listen to my orders.
[62:46.56]Something happens.
[62:47.64]Oh, God.
[62:50.32]What?
[62:55.55]When did we get... When did that... Where did that come from?
[63:03.96]What... Where did that come from?
[63:06.91]We were like just doing missions, all of a sudden this guy's talking about like, oh, I gotta be careful, there's gonna be like whites versus blacks.
[63:12.19]Like what the hell are you talking about?
[63:13.99]What?
[63:17.10]That came out of fucking nowhere.
[63:19.72]Jesus.
[63:21.12]What, like, was this guy like keeping himself up at night, like talking into a microphone?
[63:26.82]Like what a weirdo.
[63:28.40]Calm down, buddy.
[63:29.21]Alright, break it up, ladies.
[63:41.50]I want to go in the shower.
[63:42.32]I want to go in the fountain.
[63:49.09]Is this what a shower in prison is like?
[63:50.41]Just a big fountain?
[63:51.23]Apparently.
[63:59.50]I kind of want one of these.
[64:03.08]Imagine if you had a walk-in shower like this.
[64:06.18]This would be fucking awesome.
[64:12.58]It didn't matter where you were standing, it would always hit you in the right spots, like, all over your body.
[64:15.92]You could soap up.
[64:16.48]You could stand over here and, like, soap up a little bit.
[64:19.58]That sounds actually pretty cool.
[64:21.38]I wish I had one of those.
[64:23.12]Wait, all I gotta do is, like, go to prison?
[64:26.40]I mean, that... I don't know, man.
[64:27.65]That sounds... What's up, snowflake?
[64:33.57]Wait, that's the main character.
[64:34.35]The main character can't die.
[64:35.71]You've been taking me for a fool?
[64:39.75]What are you talking about?
[64:42.87]I've seen you up there hanging with the Hitler Youth, walking the walk.
[64:47.55]It's not what you think.
[64:49.25]They've got something I need.
[64:52.17]That's funny.
[64:52.93]I've got something you need, too.
[64:54.27]What is that, rat poison?
[64:58.76]You need your puff.
[64:59.84]What if a snake came out of there?
[65:03.10]It's all yours.
[65:04.12]What if I do it as a joke, Candace?
[65:05.46]Looks like your white boy luck just ran out.
[65:08.98]Move it!
[65:10.04]Everyone to the yard, now!
[65:13.23]Ow.
[65:18.51]Come on, I don't get it.
[65:19.71]I wonder why.
[65:21.66]Better go check it out.
[65:23.16]Alright, so have we established?
[65:31.91]The guy that I'm playing right now is not a character in the show, right?
[65:36.34]I'm just the nameless, faceless narrator being placed inside of the show for like a different perspective, right?
[65:45.62]Or is this guy in the show?
[65:52.02]Okay.
[65:53.31]I'm just making sure.
[65:53.95]Because when I watch the entire show after this is done, I want to know.
[66:03.26]So there's no point to this video game.
[66:05.90]At all.
[66:11.12]This video game has absolutely no point.
[66:17.16]He's just a shoehorned in guy that's... I'm going to die in this prison, right?
[66:22.08]They introduced me and got rid of me before the show was even effective.
[66:30.19]So I'm just another camera for the show.
[66:34.76]I'm just the director of the show.
[66:36.38]That's what this guy is.
[66:37.96]And he's, like, taking notes and, like, telling the crew where to go and stuff.
[66:44.09]That looks good.
[66:44.77]Looks good.
[66:46.79]Keep him walking and do the turn.
[66:51.29]Right now, that looks good.
[66:53.47]Are we framed up correctly?
[66:55.57]How does Scofield look?
[66:56.95]Got that shirt in the frame, too.
[66:59.70]And cut.
[67:00.88]Wonderful job, guys.
[67:05.89]That's a fucking +2, baby.
[67:08.07]Hey, what about this Jill?
[67:08.77]Thought I was gonna punch that guy, didn't you?
[67:11.73]Nope.
[67:16.21]Why is it focusing on this random nurse?
[67:18.47]Oh, shit, I gotta, like, tail her.
[67:25.79]Oh, right, it's prison.
[67:28.05]You can't just open a door.
[67:29.27]I forgot I'm in prison.
[67:31.35]How... You is... Who am I gonna call?
[67:38.57]I just dialed random numbers.
[67:42.82]Is he that lonely?
[67:43.80]Like pretending to be on the phone?
[67:45.04]Okay.
[67:45.14]So that is meaningless.
[67:55.83]Looks like we gotta go down here.
[67:56.97]This is probably like a hole in the fence or something.
[68:04.03]Are you telling me that they made a fence?
[68:08.68]You know what?
[68:09.16]I'm not even gonna... I'm not even... You know, that's what you... You know, that's what we're expected to talk shit about.
[68:14.11]Oh, there's like a playground fence that they just made over here.
[68:32.91]I was trying to... Get the fuck out of the way!
[68:39.33]I was trying to run around in circles, but he heard it.
[68:41.69]He actually heard me do that.
[68:42.71]Oh, this is the guy, this is my friend!
[68:45.90]Gut punch.
[68:49.90]Let's just wait for them to do it again.
[68:51.22]Cut, take two.
[68:57.74]Nurse going into infirmary, take two, scene four, and action!
[69:04.98]Okay, now I need you to walk past the guard.
[69:06.72]Guard, stare over here.
[69:10.27]Now make your exit.
[69:11.23]Make your way out of the door.
[69:14.07]Get that in frame.
[69:15.99]Really meanly.
[69:18.21]Perfect.
[69:18.55]Cut it.
[69:29.06]Follow the doctors.
[69:29.96]This is what it is.
[69:30.50]This is what it is.
[69:31.94]This is what it is.
[69:35.96]See, I'm a method director.
[69:38.36]I don't want my actors to even know that they're being filmed.
[69:41.96]I go by every means necessary.
[69:46.86]I want my actors to be raw and real.
[69:52.33]I'm Anthony DiLoppio.
[69:54.31]Method director.
[69:57.07]There they are.
[70:00.95]Okay, action!
[70:03.33]And we got it.
[70:07.49]Alright, can I should I move on from this one?
[70:09.21]Yeah Meathead method director You don't have to flip man, you really don't Come on, there's no jump.
[70:34.84]No, there is a jump.
[70:35.50]Oh
[70:39.10]Get the fuck on the other side.
[70:40.20]What are you doing?
[70:46.86]Drop.
[70:49.31]What do I need to do?
[70:50.23]No.
[70:50.55]Get down here.
[70:53.51]Drop down.
[70:56.31]Oh my god.
[71:00.23]Why won't he let go?
[71:01.06]I have to go.
[71:04.60]Jesus Christ.
[71:13.87]As you can see we need a Wait wait wait wait, this is important This is the this is the commentary of the directors commentary Commentating over me the director getting a shot.
[71:26.01]So I'm the director commentating over my own shot right here So as you can see we really need to get a high angle of the next scene they told me to be aware harness, but I said Fuck it.
[71:37.97]Never mind
[71:41.06]I'm too fucking, it's over.
[71:43.85]No more of that.
[71:45.47]It's gonna happen again, but like I'm done.
[71:47.79]It's not gonna happen anymore.
[71:54.72]It's too fucking stupid.
[71:56.74]I nailed it.
[71:57.30]Yeah, I nailed it.
[72:00.56]Oh, fuck.
[72:05.04]Go, get up there.
[72:10.20]Is that guy going to climb up?
[72:11.90]That one had potential.
[72:12.94]I know, but it took too long.
[72:16.28]No, not too long.
[72:17.02]It was too short of a climb.
[72:18.28]I was thinking I was going to go around the whole building, but I didn't.
[72:22.00]What am I jumping to?
[72:26.46]Why on Earth would you do that?
[72:42.77]This is just shitty hitman at this point.
[72:45.05]He's not coming in here, is he?
[72:47.13]And action.
[72:48.04]And action.
[72:48.40]What am I actioning?
[72:49.88]See, look.
[72:50.70]I'm just the camera.
[72:51.16]Yeah, sure.
[73:13.56]I can't leave.
[73:19.44]I missed it.
[73:20.44]I missed it.
[73:22.45]Camera missed it, apparently.
[73:24.65]What?
[73:24.79]Oh, here's a door.
[73:38.86]Nah, cut.
[73:39.74]We're gonna do it again.
[73:40.76]Bad camera work.
[73:42.92]Stop talking so loud.
[73:43.40]Director break.
[73:47.38]This really is director break.
[74:07.92]I can't get caught though.
[74:08.54]It's going to make me do the whole thing again.
[74:09.76]No joking around.
[74:10.88]Because I don't want to do this again.
[74:12.04]Don't get seen by this fucking lady.
[74:14.80]There's no rock I can throw at her head.
[74:18.27]That's awful.
[74:19.15]Why would I want to do that?
[74:23.19]I actually can't get out of here.
[74:26.71]Do I have to go through here?
[74:29.14]What are they doing to this guy?
[74:36.93]It looks like I can go in this door.
[74:38.59]But I can't.
[74:41.07]I gotta go all the way around.
[74:42.67]Alright.
[74:43.27]That's annoying.
[74:49.55]There's a guy right here.
[74:50.59]Don't get spotted by this guy.
[74:51.69]I'm not doing this entire fucking thing again.
[74:54.75]Somebody saw me.
[74:56.75]Or did they?
[74:58.15]Oh god.
[74:58.41]I gotta go to the elevator.
[74:59.99]Wait.
[75:00.11]Do I have to go up or down?
[75:01.85]Okay.
[75:02.01]Shit.
[75:02.75]Shit.
[75:12.51]No!
[75:16.11]Thank God.
[75:22.41]Avocado toast.
[75:28.83]What's with this avocado toast thing you guys keep saying?
[75:36.71]I'm not going to hit this camera.
[75:38.83]This guy will see me.
[75:39.47]I'm going to sneak by the camera and by this guy.
[75:43.79]Should be easy as long as I do it right.
[75:46.49]Action.
[75:55.44]Perfect.
[75:58.38]Oh!
[75:59.39]You done in the infirmary?
[76:01.03]Back in the yard.
[76:07.67]Okay.
[76:08.05]Have a good day.
[76:12.02]I'm not where I'm supposed to be.
[76:14.30]They're just letting me in.
[76:17.04]Oh, did you have fun in there?
[76:18.30]Come on back in, honey.
[76:20.26]Come back into recess.
[76:26.46]Okay, that works for me.
[76:33.85]No, I wanted his phone.
[76:38.01]Schofield is taking drugs to get daily access to the infirmary Find out more dammit stop Schofield anywhere you can but don't mess with Burroughs These guys are both having the same conversation Or he's mocking him and he doesn't know you know like he's behind his back mocking him To like one of his friends and the other friends like laughing at their other friend What?
[77:02.94]War's coming and looks like you're wearing the wrong color skin.
[77:06.26]Oh, God.
[77:06.44]Someone might make a mistake, think you're a Nazi, cut your ass to gullet.
[77:10.62]Am I right, brothers?
[77:12.74]Right.
[77:15.32]We could let that happen.
[77:18.00]That was very unenthusiastic.
[77:19.58]You want me to do something for you, right?
[77:21.86]Oh, God.
[77:24.14]See now, you and me are on the same frequency already.
[77:27.08]They don't agree with that.
[77:27.98]I need to give me a good supply of a drug called Pugnax.
[77:31.48]They stash it in the loony bin.
[77:33.42]Right.
[77:33.98]I get it for you.
[77:35.10]You watch my back?
[77:36.51]Like you was from the hood.
[77:38.47]Deal.
[77:39.17]You sure it's in the asylum?
[77:40.95]Yeah.
[77:41.57]Secure cabinet.
[77:43.03]You're gonna need a lockpick.
[77:45.27]And be careful of them J-Cats.
[77:47.25]Them boys?
[77:48.07]It's crazy.
[77:50.19]Okay.
[77:51.94]Hey!
[77:53.22]Hey!
[77:54.26]Excuse me!
[77:58.06]That was uncalled for.
[77:59.90]What was that?
[78:02.76]Why am I looking?
[78:03.20]What am I staring at?
[78:04.40]That guy's trying to swing at me.
[78:18.01]Okay, whatever.
[78:18.71]Bye.
[78:19.10]Is that him?
[78:20.10]Who's saying this?
[78:20.90]Okay.
[78:29.49]Right.
[78:30.36]Hi, John.
[78:31.46]How's teats?
[78:32.50]Hey, Jimmy.
[78:33.80]Still not talking.
[78:34.56]Noise complaint?
[78:35.92]Noise complaint.
[78:36.56]I need a lockpick.
[78:38.02]What do I look like?
[78:39.18]A hardware store?
[78:39.72]Have a good day, Jimmy.
[78:40.58]No, you look like the man in charge.
[78:42.02]It's me, John Wick.
[78:43.05]Got that right.
[78:44.77]Tell you what.
[78:45.95]Fiorella lost his shank.
[78:47.59]He's gonna need one when the thesis hits the fan.
[78:49.99]Yeah.
[78:50.87]You get me a solid kitchen knife.
[78:53.03]I'll get you a lockpick.
[78:55.72]Got it.
[78:56.84]You bring it to me outside the kitchen.
[78:59.06]I got a crew there painting walls.
[79:05.14]Enter the kitchen.
[79:05.96]I'm just like an errand boy.
[79:07.53]I want to do something else.
[79:08.69]Now I want to fight again.
[79:10.47]Have I seen John Wick 2?
[79:14.69]I've not seen John Wick 2 yet.
[79:17.79]But it apparently looks very good.
[79:23.75]I love John Wick 1.
[79:24.55]It's a very good movie.
[79:30.50]Are you the only one that enjoys Peter Stormare's unironically?
[79:34.33]Can I speak in a fucking complete sentence?
[79:36.83]Am I the only one who unironically enjoys Peter Stormare's accent?
[79:40.51]I love his accent.
[79:41.52]I think it's great.
[79:45.92]Two is good.
[79:46.60]That's good.
[79:48.36]I find it very, very interesting.
[79:49.76]Very funny.
[79:51.67]Like, there's a lot of, like, funny, like, tongue-in-cheek moments in John Wick.
[79:56.65]Like the thing I just said, like, the evening, Jimmy.
[79:59.46]Like, yeah, you got a noise complaint.
[80:02.38]I love, like, the little stuff like that.
[80:04.00]It's not a comedy, but they make, like, a lot of, like, in-references to themselves.
[80:07.60]It's funny.
[80:11.88]And what's the actor's name that just recently passed away?
[80:16.95]That was the main antagonist.
[80:19.76]What was his name?
[80:20.24]He was fantastic.
[80:24.48]Not... What's his name?
[80:26.52]Not Alfie Allen.
[80:28.72]His father.
[80:32.82]I need lockpicking tools.
[80:42.56]That actor... I forget his name.
[80:44.80]Yeah, that's a pipe.
[80:46.64]I know.
[80:49.36]You guys all just wrote, like, everyone just wrote a different name in the chat.
[80:55.66]I see, like, 28 different names.
[81:00.79]Alf Allen.
[81:01.43]No, Alfie Allen.
[81:05.19]No, not Ralphie Allen.
[81:08.09]No.
[81:08.87]No, not Jerry Lewis.
[81:11.53]Not Jerry fucking Lewis.
[81:13.09]Oh, my God.
[81:13.87]You guys, come on.
[81:23.61]Jim Davis.
[81:24.45]Somebody wrote it correctly and I don't even know what... Nicolas Cage.
[81:28.63]Nick Cage was not in that movie.
[81:30.57]I'm looking his fucking name up right now.
[81:39.54]John Wick.
[81:45.18]Starring... Ian McShane is in that movie and he's great.
[81:54.25]What's his name?
[81:54.99]Where is he?
[81:57.73]There it is.
[81:58.13]Michael, Michael Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick.
[82:01.61]What?
[82:01.73]How do you say this name?
[82:02.53]Nickquist?
[82:03.33]Nickfist?
[82:05.79]Michael Nickfist?
[82:07.99]How do you pronounce this last name?
[82:09.81]Michael Nickfist.
[82:11.33]Nickquist.
[82:12.31]Nyquist.
[82:13.51]Nyquil.
[82:14.19]How do you say this guy's fucking name?
[82:15.60]I can't say his name.
[82:16.52]I don't know how to say this name.
[82:23.10]N-Y-Q-V-I-S-T.
[82:25.89]Nickvist?
[82:32.87]Nesquik?
[82:34.15]Nisquik?
[82:35.73]Nivquist?
[82:39.39]Well, anyways, that guy was a great fucking actor and he was good in that movie and he recently died and it's unfortunate.
[82:49.25]Nyquist?
[82:49.49]Nyquist?
[83:01.76]It's Nike.
[83:04.90]Nike-vist.
[83:10.32]That's too many Y's and Q's for me.
[83:16.47]But yeah, he was a fucking phenomenal actor.
[83:19.91]And his role in that movie was so good that it saddens me every single time I watch that movie.
[83:38.16]How do I get through this?
[83:43.90]It actually is pronounced Nick Fist.
[83:46.00]Okay.
[83:48.93]So I was saying it right.
[83:54.77]We're talking about John Wick.
[83:57.67]This guy's too close.
[84:01.05]I have to steal like a fucking kitchen knife.
[84:09.98]How am I supposed to do this?
[84:20.50]Um... This shouldn't be working, but it is somehow.
[84:32.41]I guess I just have to make it to the end.
[84:35.99]I wish I could drown this guy.
[84:37.83]No, I don't.
[84:38.35]Why am I saying that?
[84:45.81]Ask if I can borrow the knife.
[84:46.79]Hey, can I borrow the knife?
[84:54.93]What is this guy's purpose?
[84:55.89]This guy's just, like, staring.
[84:59.48]You would absolutely hear that, by the way.
[85:01.80]You would hear a guy fucking doing, like, a tumble behind you.
[85:04.14]Alright, here it is.
[85:06.90]Take it.
[85:12.14]Get the knife.
[85:12.65]What?
[85:17.66]Oh, this guy's burning the food.
[85:18.66]I thought he was talking to me.
[85:25.17]Alright, we're almost out.
[85:26.13]Can I hide in, like, the freezer?
[85:35.86]No, I just gotta get out of here.
[85:38.14]Wait for this guy.
[85:40.74]I'm taking this so seriously.
[85:42.02]It's like, it's kind of a joke how seriously I'm taking this.
[85:43.94]Alright, I'm good.
[85:52.32]He's just standing in here.
[85:53.56]Without any prison clothes on.
[85:58.07]Should I just gut him?
[86:00.51]This should cut right through some of that dark meat.
[86:04.39]Guess I'll call off those guys I told to shank you.
[86:08.52]It was a joke, Fish.
[86:11.22]Very funny.
[86:12.56]Here.
[86:12.86]A lot of memories in this one.
[86:15.52]Take good care of it.
[86:20.73]I've got the lockpick, so I'm ready to go after the pugnac for C-Note.
[86:24.51]Next stop, Crazy Town.
[86:27.24]Crazy.
[86:27.94]Going to Crazy Town.
[86:29.10]Alright, let's go.
[86:36.80]Lockpicking a guy.
[86:37.98]Yeah, manipulate tension and pick the lock.
[86:39.70]You got it.
[86:48.29]Wait, what?
[86:51.70]I have to... What the fuck is going on here?
[87:07.31]Okay.
[87:07.87]That's a... Alright.
[87:09.03]I got it.
[87:09.71]I got it.
[87:10.13]Everybody calm down.
[87:17.21]How did I know that guy was going to be right there?
[87:20.90]That guy's not even on the map.
[87:22.90]He just appears out of here.
[87:32.46]Why can I not just stab this guy in the neck?
[87:39.03]See, if this were Hitman, both these guys would be dead.
[87:44.13]But now I have to wait for this guy to turn around, and this guy to turn his back.
[87:48.78]Like that.
[87:51.31]Hopefully you stay here for a long time, otherwise I'm in deep shit.
[87:53.58]No, he turned around again.
[87:59.08]Yeah, I'm also a police... Why can't I just tell these guys that I'm also a police officer?
[88:02.76]Like... I could just be like, hey, by the way, I'm undercover.
[88:06.23]Look at me.
[88:18.96]Okay, he fucking leaves.
[88:20.42]Jesus.
[88:25.80]This just got way too complicated.
[88:30.12]Come on.
[88:30.64]Move.
[88:34.64]Got it.
[88:37.36]I gotta go.
[88:38.61]Quickly.
[88:41.15]Come on.
[88:44.45]Slam dunk.
[88:47.39]Do I gotta pick this lock?
[88:48.81]Yep.
[88:49.27]Oh, shit.
[88:51.81]What are you doing?
[88:57.38]Oh god, hurry up.
[88:58.61]Get over there.
[89:05.01]Nice.
[89:05.37]Just like fucking Skyrim.
[89:10.77]Wait, what?
[89:14.05]Wasn't I just here?
[89:19.19]What?
[89:19.82]Hold on a minute.
[89:20.30]Wasn't I just in the fucking kitchen?
[89:22.24]Why would I...
[89:29.16]Oh my god.
[89:30.02]Ugh.
[89:31.64]Alright, I'm about to change games.
[89:39.29]This game is stupid.
[89:52.32]Go play the voice.
[89:53.18]We're playing the voice on a different day, don't worry.
[89:58.94]The guy yawned as he spotted me.
[90:00.46]Yeah.
[90:01.42]I don't like this nonsense of having to fucking run around corners and wait for, like, the stupid... Oh, God.
[90:06.32]What am I doing?
[90:06.78]I'm, like, freaking out.
[90:11.09]Quickly, get to where I need to be, pick this dumb lock, and be in the kitchen again.
[90:22.91]Get down here.
[90:25.65]Come on.
[90:28.58]Just play the xylophone.
[90:30.11]Thank you.
[90:30.49]Alright, now I have to get over there.
[90:37.05]Here comes a guy.
[90:38.51]He doesn't turn this way, does he?
[90:39.57]No, that's the guy that just looks inside of the freezer and doesn't do anything.
[90:43.56]I think I can get behind him.
[90:45.46]I'm not gonna risk it.
[90:49.58]Fuck, that guy better not see me.
[90:54.31]Okay, pick this lock, right?
[90:56.83]Fuck.
[90:59.28]Wait, I'm... Wait a minute.
[91:01.21]Wait a minute.
[91:01.77]Wait a minute.
[91:02.35]Wait a minute.
[91:03.47]Wait a minute.
[91:07.99]How do I get in this room?
[91:12.11]Oh, fuck.
[91:12.91]Don't look at me.
[91:16.20]If I can't go in there... What?
[91:25.14]Do I have to go all the way around?
[91:26.76]What?
[91:31.98]Oh, this is a conundrum.
[91:34.62]It sure is.
[91:44.75]Oh, we're in sub only mode?
[91:46.75]Did everybody lose their minds?
[91:49.29]What did we lose our minds about?
[91:50.63]I think I gotta go in that door.
[91:59.50]These guys have to move.
[92:03.91]How do I get these guys to get out of the way?
[92:16.45]I just want to stand up and sprint.
[92:35.77]What the fuck?
[92:42.50]I just have to go up there.
[92:44.64]And I have to like wrap around the fucking kitchen.
[92:46.38]Oh, hey, look at this.
[92:47.72]I thought I saw somebody in here.
[92:49.58]No, no, no, I didn't.
[92:53.18]Yeah, yes, I did.
[93:09.30]We're gonna move on.
[93:12.60]This game just turned into like a dumb shitty stealth game.
[93:16.30]It started out fun.
[93:22.75]That was a good like an hour and 30 minutes.
[93:25.65]I had fun for like an hour and 30 minutes.
[93:28.67]Alright, so.
[93:30.39]We're moving on to another.
[93:33.21]The best part about this is I love what we're moving on to.
[93:39.45]Let me get it.
[93:39.91]It's like, you thought that was like the only TV or movie game we were gonna play?
[93:47.35]Well, I'm sorry to fucking burst your bubble, but you would be incorrect.
[93:54.85]I just, I just didn't get it.
[93:55.95]We're going from this, isn't it at the very, it is at the very bottom.
[94:03.86]Okay, there it is.
[94:05.76]No, not Duck Dynasty, not NCIS.
[94:10.91]This one's a movie, not a prison game.
[94:15.18]Moving on to the Bourne Conspiracy.
[94:19.38]If I didn't lose you already with that one.
[94:35.63]True lies.
[94:42.99]Don't turn it off.
[94:48.15]Here it comes.
[94:52.33]I don't think this game is even on Twitch.
[94:53.93]Like half the games I play.
[95:01.19]We're going to play the Bourne Conspiracy.
[95:05.15]How do you spell this?
[95:10.84]Bourne.
[95:14.47]The bouncer.
[95:15.11]No, it's not the bouncer.
[95:18.01]No, it's not on fucking Twitch.
[95:24.64]How do I put this on Twitch?
[95:27.32]Born to Rock?
[95:31.58]Born to Rock, I guess is the name of the game we're playing.
[95:33.85]Do you remember?
[95:35.45]THX.

[96:58.84]Jborn Born to Rock.
[96:59.80]That's what we're going with.
[97:03.18]Yeah, I can't just do my facecam.
[97:05.52]It'll crash OBS.
[97:08.99]If I turn the facecam on, OBS is going to crash and we can't have that.
[97:12.32]So in the meantime... Alright, hold on.
[97:16.34]I hope it doesn't fucking crash.
[97:18.66]I gotta move over here.
[97:19.52]I'm gonna be very careful about this.
[97:25.20]We're gonna be very careful about this shit.
[97:31.27]This is dangerous.
[97:32.41]Alright.
[97:37.52]Here we go.
[97:39.05]Is OBS going to crash?
[97:40.53]Place your bets.
[97:42.99]Okay, it's plugged in.
[97:48.23]I'm going to give it a second.
[97:50.06]I'm actually going to go over here because if it does crash, then it's okay.
[97:56.16]Because then, you know, you don't have to worry about a thing.
[98:00.93]We're still here.
[98:04.37]Here we go.
[98:05.63]Add a capture device.
[98:07.71]Good luck, everybody.
[98:12.19]Good luck.

[98:35.71]Yeah!
[98:37.25]Oh, fucking fantastic!
[98:38.75]Hey, don't worry, it crashed OBS.
[98:43.29]Un-fucking-believable.
[98:47.21]Why?
[98:47.97]I don't fucking... I don't get that.
[98:49.53]It doesn't make any fucking sense.
[98:56.57]Why don't I leave it plugged in?
[98:57.65]Because my computer is broken.
[98:59.81]And only two USB ports work.
[99:02.99]So I can't... If I plug in anything else to my USB, I have to unplug the webcam.
[99:10.41]Stupid piece of shit technology.
[99:12.23]I'll be right back.
[99:13.55]No, you know what?
[99:13.99]Fuck that.
[99:14.41]I'm not turning the stream off.
[99:15.45]That's stupid.
[99:18.57]It's almost done.
[99:22.88]This computer is like four months old.
[99:27.04]I fucking hate technology.
[99:29.72]I hate it.
[99:30.08]I'll see you guys in, I'm coming back in 30 seconds.
