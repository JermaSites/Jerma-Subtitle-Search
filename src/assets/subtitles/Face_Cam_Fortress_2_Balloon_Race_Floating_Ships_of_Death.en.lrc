[00:08.90]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.67]Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2.
[00:13.13]It's been a while since I've seen some Facecam Fortress 2, and I do apologize about... What the hell?
[00:18.39]What?
[00:19.09]What?
[00:19.75]Whoa, hey!
[00:21.23]That guy's, like, glitching through the gate!
[00:22.75]Uh, this is Balloon Race, by the way, if you didn't know.
[00:26.49]How did that guy, like, get through the gate?
[00:28.01]What a freak show.
[00:29.67]Gonna do some facecam fortress on Balloon Race.
[00:32.47]What the hell?
[00:33.27]Music is playing in the background right now.

[00:43.17]What?
[00:43.33]Do they spawn, like... What?
[00:46.23]What?
[00:46.91]I have no idea how this mode really, like, works.
[00:49.37]Oh, Scout!
[00:49.89]They're just, like, appearing on our ship?
[00:54.02]That's BS.

[01:25.03]I was gonna say, that would suck.
[01:27.19]Give me more health.
[01:27.75]This guy's trying to shoot in the window.
[01:30.43]Oh, I got to lead my targets a little bit here.
[01:33.48]Try and get it in the window.
[01:34.86]I got it in the window.
[01:36.26]This is ridiculous.
[01:38.56]They're going to win.
[01:40.60]Oh, get crit.
[01:42.72]Alright, seriously, I need a medic.
[01:45.78]I need a medic right now.

[03:01.59]What?
[03:02.66]This guy's in our spawn!
[03:04.32]That's the glitching Demoman from the beginning.
[03:07.62]What a son of a bitch.
[03:09.44]This guy's just hanging out in the spawn with his glitches.
[03:14.10]Let me just hit a tree real quick.
[03:16.03]Alright, here we go.
[03:17.09]What's up, everybody?
[03:18.53]Mini-Sentry, screw you!
[03:20.15]Come here, you... We don't even have the first point capped.
[03:24.93]How do you cap points?
[03:28.29]No idea what's happening.
[03:31.76]I got him.
[03:33.12]Pyro coming down the stairs.
[03:34.14]Oh, so we have to cap that?
[03:40.78]We just, like, stand on the treasure chest?
[03:43.16]Alright, I think I get it now.
[03:45.40]I think... What?
[03:46.62]Oh.
[03:47.82]Get... I seriously have no clue.
[03:52.73]It's definitely the treasure chest.
[03:53.99]Alright, knowing that, I'm hanging out up here.
[04:02.09]Come here.
[04:03.87]Oh, let me help this heavy out.
[04:05.00]Let's get it.
[04:05.44]Let's cap it.

[04:07.48]Come on, everybody.
[04:08.14]Come on.
[04:10.24]Damn it.
[04:12.64]This is point number one.
[04:16.14]There's so much going on right now for my tiny brain to handle.
[04:19.91]Oh, we got it.
[04:20.33]We got it.
[04:20.67]Good, good, good.
[04:21.13]Good job.

[04:29.05]Oh, shit.
[04:29.67]I keep calling it different things.
[04:33.29]Get back down here.
[04:34.05]Let's hide down here.
[04:34.79]It's heavy as freaking out.
[04:39.79]That's a good thing.
[04:43.78]Oh, long shot.
[04:44.62]Long shot.
[04:46.74]I'm standing still right now.
[04:48.68]This is not going to be good.
[04:49.86]Here we go.
[04:53.44]This Huntsman right is just in his glory mode.
[04:59.17]They're all swimming.
[05:00.67]They're all swimming over here.
[05:02.85]Oh, let's beach it.
[05:03.57]Let's beach it.
[05:05.32]Oh yeah, we're beaching it.
[05:06.58]This guy's toast right here.
[05:09.60]He died before I could even get to him.
[05:12.20]Oh no, you don't.
[05:12.92]Oh no, you don't.
[05:15.28]Oh no, you don't.
[05:17.82]Oh boy.
[05:18.50]I'm in trouble.
[05:19.62]I'm in trouble.
[05:21.47]Are there teleporters?
[05:23.21]I am so confused right now.
[05:25.51]I'm going in a teleporter.
[05:26.43]Can I destroy these?
[05:29.10]No, let's go in.
[05:30.00]Can I go in?
[05:31.72]Damn it, you can't go in.
[05:36.29]Get out of town here.
[05:37.41]Oh, I can go... Apparently I died.
[05:40.97]Don't know how.
[05:41.49]Apparently a mini-sentry.

[05:46.72]Dude!
[05:47.74]Oh, somebody get hit by that crit!
[05:49.42]No, I didn't do good enough.
[05:52.36]Well, we're way behind right now.
[05:56.94]Shoot a... Shoot... Let me shoot, like, through that thing.
[06:00.94]This guy's got a wrangled Mini-Sentry.
[06:07.77]Alright, let's go.
[06:09.83]I'm gonna cause absolute carnage right here.
[06:11.67]You ready for this?
[06:13.09]Carnage mode activated!
[06:15.41]Stickies!
[06:16.69]You're pushing me off!
[06:17.79]Let's push... Ugh!
[06:19.94]The thing... The boat pushed me off the friggin'... Dr. Pepper.
[06:27.48]Let's go here.
[06:32.41]Is he going to get hit by that crit?
[06:33.47]He's standing still.
[06:38.65]I killed two people.
[06:40.61]I killed two people with that.
[06:41.99]Are you kidding me?
[06:45.50]No, you're pushing me off.
[06:48.04]That big fat bastard heavy just shoved me off of it.
[06:51.32]Oh, you...
[06:53.19]Oh my god, that was crazy.
[06:55.19]We're so far behind.
[06:56.87]I don't know where I'm going, but apparently we're going down here.
[06:59.05]Get everybody.
[06:59.83]Give me like a triple kill right here.
[07:03.78]Heal me, medic!
[07:06.98]Come here, you!
[07:09.38]He's dead.
[07:13.32]Balloon race is out of control.
[07:15.40]Holy crap.
[07:21.17]Get on that point.
[07:24.54]I gotta land some shots.
[07:30.08]Oh, they're all coming up here right now.
[07:33.36]That guy's got crits.
[07:34.74]He can't hit me.
[07:35.90]Aha, he can't hit me.
[07:38.92]Oh, get it.
[07:40.62]Get it, baby.
[07:42.52]They capped that point, too.
[07:45.68]I'm gonna kill that.
[07:46.18]Oh, I got him.
[07:47.54]Oh, yeah.
[07:48.32]I'm so happy about that shot.
[07:50.17]Yeah.
[07:51.55]Wait for me!
[07:52.37]Wait for me, please!
[07:53.61]Please!
[07:53.89]Yeah, okay.
[07:56.81]Danka.
[07:57.71]Dying, I'm dying.
[08:00.31]I'm dying.
[08:01.41]Oh, you gotta heal me, medic.
[08:02.37]You gotta heal me.
[08:05.25]Dammit!
[08:08.67]We are getting beat pretty bad right now, I'm assuming.
[08:11.97]Judging by the fact that we crit.
[08:14.85]Didn't kill anybody with it, though.
[08:16.43]And apparently I still have the rage.
[08:20.12]Oh, we're about to lose.
[08:23.37]Oh, you Scorch Shot son of a bitch.
[08:26.78]That guy's got the right idea.
[08:27.98]He's got the Scorch Shot.
[08:30.16]You bastard.
[08:32.44]Oh, it's over.
[08:33.04]It is over right now.
[08:34.34]It's over.
[08:36.88]It is so over.
[08:40.50]We can't... I keep hitting those people in the back.
[08:42.26]Alright, we're going for an epic rocket jump super kill.
[08:44.89]Here we go.
[08:47.41]Oh, yeah!
[08:47.99]I'm on the king of the mountain!
[08:52.11]The killer.
[08:57.52]I'm just gonna start whipping people.
[08:59.24]Are we actually gonna cap this?
[09:01.12]No, we're not.
[09:04.80]Oh, man.
[09:05.28]I gotta stay alive up here.
[09:08.76]Crap.
[09:12.70]This is just complete chaos.
[09:14.07]Is anybody even gonna be able to get this point?
[09:15.77]I don't think anyone's gonna be able to even cap this point.
[09:18.31]It is too chaotic.
[09:23.87]Get out of here.
[09:30.45]See you later.
[09:31.45]I'm gone.
[09:33.77]Wow, blue's actually on it.
[09:35.93]We're gonna cap it.
[09:36.57]Is this gonna be a tie?
[09:37.65]This is gonna be a tie, right?
[09:39.09]It has to be.
[09:41.23]Time has been added.
[09:42.89]There's more time left?
[09:44.65]What else are we gonna do?
[09:46.85]No!
[09:47.53]Don't leave without me!
[09:54.87]Crap.
[09:55.91]I missed the boat.
[09:59.54]So do we just go in a circle?
[10:01.34]When does this end?
[10:03.20]How do you like beat?
[10:05.32]No vote, I don't know.
[10:07.62]How do you win?
[10:08.36]I think we're... This is just like an open field over here.
[10:14.73]I've only played Balloon Race like a couple times.
[10:17.59]Maybe like three or four times and I loved it.
[10:20.31]But I just never really understand what the hell is going on in this game mode.
[10:25.65]I'm jumping off the boat.
[10:26.67]We're going to try and pick some people off.
[10:30.62]Come on, let me get a couple of long-range beauty shots.
[10:35.23]Just gonna clean people up as they come down.
[10:37.13]What's up?
[10:38.03]That guy got crushed.
[10:40.59]You're wrangling this entry from all the way back there?
[10:42.71]Holy crap, man.
[10:46.41]No.
[10:47.63]No.
[10:49.89]No, way too many people.
[10:54.89]Get rid of this heavy.
[10:55.67]Thank you.
[10:58.56]And get rid of this guy.
[10:59.60]This guy right here.
[11:01.06]Get rid of him.
[11:01.90]And this guy.
[11:07.17]Yay, we did it.
[11:08.61]And I got on the top of the scoreboard somehow.
[11:11.65]Well, that's going to be it, guys.
[11:14.01]Thank you all so much for watching.
[11:15.13]Really do appreciate it.
[11:16.09]Balloon Race for the return of Facecam Fortress 2.
[11:20.89]Mm-mm.
[11:21.55]I'll see you guys all next time.
[11:23.38]And of course... Wait, we won again?
[11:25.16]Is that a double victory?
[11:27.54]Sweet, dude.
[11:28.10]Well, I'll see you guys all next time.
[11:29.35]And of course, take care, everybody.
[11:31.17]See y'all soon.
