[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.01]You see what... I gotta rush and get up there now.
[00:08.07]Yeah.
[00:10.88]Wait.
[00:11.08]So it is... So that's your fault.
[00:12.94]But... But hold on, though.
[00:14.36]I didn't... I said, you good to go?
[00:16.58]I'm gonna take a shower and get set up.
[00:18.04]And you said, yeah.
[00:18.84]You were awake.
[00:22.94]Yeah.
[00:24.57]So, you... Were you... Okay, were you in, like, a full-on panic when you said...
[00:30.34]yeah um I was a little confused at first and then I realized I like checked my phone and you hadn't sent me a Discord message so I kind of just laid in bed for a while
[00:42.51]How you doing?
[00:43.67]You sound a lot louder today.
[00:46.23]I did adjust my mic a little bit this week because I heard that I was low on yours and I always, I don't know, I feel like I'm low a lot of the time.
[00:54.79]You definitely, yeah, I turned you down.
[00:58.36]You're in a good spot.
[00:59.70]Good.
[01:00.62]Yeah, hope you're doing good.
[01:03.28]I heard and I did see that you were playing Nioh 2.
[01:08.54]Is there any assessment you can give us?
[01:10.56]I I can give you an assessment because since I talked to you about neo last week I have 40 hours played and I can tell you that this morning I was really excited to play Elden Ring with you and a little bit disappointed when I realized it wasn't neo wow
[01:26.04]Wait a minute.
[01:27.10]Hold on a second.
[01:29.10]So you're... Well, I mean, just mechanically speaking, the combat, because Elden Ring, as you said, kind of is just attack with weapon.
[01:37.60]There's like no nuance to a lot of the stuff that you do.
[01:39.94]Yeah.
[01:41.29]There's a lot I don't like about Nioh.
[01:43.98]The first 10 hours were like grinding your face on a cheese grater to try and understand all of the different words where you need to charge up.
[01:52.76]You need to gather enough anima.
[01:54.76]No, I still don't even know.
[01:55.79]You need to gather enough Amarita to charge up your anima to get your yokai shift ready.
[02:02.77]It's like nothing was designed for a human to understand.
[02:06.87]But you've kind of grown accustomed to that and you actually prefer it now.
[02:12.55]um I would say mechanically combat is a lot of fun and I was even thinking in bed last night because I was like you know he's gonna ask me like how would I rate it like Elden Ring is is obviously it's too good you can't compare right but then I was thinking about like the last Dark soulslike Dark Souls 3 and trying to compare to that and I realized is it just me or was Dark Souls 3 not memorable at all
[02:35.73]uh I actually went back to try it again the first time in a while and it actually I I found myself saying more often than than not going this like sucks I don't think it sucks but I was like you know how you like think back to Elden Ring you can think of like Malenia and the boss at the end like all the like even Dark Souls 2 I have so many memories and I was like okay well what are the zones in Dark Souls 3.
[03:03.20]yeah there's like the crab in the swamp is like I I was really blanking for way too long and it is a great game maybe that's just like the sign that like it's out of my memory and I could play it again but
[03:17.12]I'm gonna have to probably do a serious reassessment of where I put the FromSoftware games, because I did play some Dark Souls 3 off-stream, like, I don't know, last year at some point.
[03:26.81]And I really did.
[03:27.45]It seemed like every single area.
[03:30.45]I think, like, Holly was sitting next to me on the couch.
[03:33.65]And I'm just like, this is fucking stupid.
[03:35.55]Like, this area is fucking dumb.
[03:37.33]a lot of the game is set up to like piss you off I feel like they took a little bit of a she's like do you like this game like I thought you liked I thought this was like one of your favorites and I'm like yeah it is I think they blur together too like some of the areas I'm like was that Dark Souls 3 but like the like frozen area with the invisible enemies
[03:58.12]I don't remember.
[03:59.08]Playing through Dark Souls 1, I think I did it sort of in the same period.
[04:05.01]Dark Souls 1, I hate with a passion two or three spots in Dark Souls 1.
[04:12.08]But I think as a whole, I think it is, it's probably just better than Dark Souls 3 and I had it wrong.
[04:17.62]I had it flipped.
[04:23.68]But who knows?
[04:24.22]Dude, I could go back like a year or two from now, play through it again, and have the completely opposite opinion.
[04:31.79]That's just how these games work.
[04:35.01]Around that time was over saturated with like soulslike and I played so many and by the time Dark Souls 3 was there was like this was good, but I just I played so many I feel like I what about Sekiro?
[04:47.65]I feel like I'm Sekiro I just completely just wiped it from my memory and like it was good But like I it was it it was though.
[04:57.23]I remember it was like really really good This game is very loud
[05:03.95]Actually, at the time, I was a Sekiro non-enjoyer.
[05:09.93]But I think I've come around.
[05:13.95]Yeah, you were a Sekiro non-enjoyer for a while.
[05:18.49]there was like one simple mechanic that pushed me over the edge of like needing to farm for healing or like just in general like you could only use your your arm moves a certain amount of times and you had to like collect arm oil or some shit that's like why would you gate the like fun mechanic around like I need to farm enough resource to use this
[05:39.85]yeah it's just all these games you just like flip on them every like six months I have a different opinion of each one of these games it's weird how that works I swear I promise you
[05:51.52]Well, the assessment is Nioh 2.
[05:54.52]I'd say it was better than Dark Souls 3.
[05:55.90]I don't have a lot of fun.
[05:57.46]The level design is actually crazy good.
[06:00.92]It has like, I wish the areas were a little bit more interesting, like Dark Souls environments really can't be beat.
[06:06.29]Yeah.
[06:07.03]But like once you finally get over the hump of these mechanics, like do not make any sense and they're basically not in English.
[06:15.45]There's a lot of fun to the game.
[06:19.38]I'm willing to try it.
[06:21.62]I probably don't think I'd want to stream that game.
[06:24.08]I don't think you would... I think not streaming it is a great call.
[06:30.72]I have never been backseated with such crazy... Such just determinated backseating.
[06:38.87]Yes, you're not going to understand what's happening and you're going to get frustrated because the game has a lot of frustrating shit.
[06:44.82]and you're gonna get like mad and you're gonna look to chat for like some sort of like we're in this together like that fucking sucked and chat's gonna be like you need to keep pulse more often like dude you're so bad like it's me it makes me angry
[06:58.80]Hey, so, so, um, can I get some support in here?
[07:01.32]And you just look over and it's just, like, like, the people have, like, the stream muted.
[07:05.67]Like, the mute thing.
[07:06.49]It's just like, oh, okay.
[07:09.17]You're not even listening.
[07:10.91]It has, like, new content for, like, new game plus one, two, three, four.
[07:15.14]Like, it has a lot of content.
[07:17.34]So I think there's some people that have spent, like, thousands of hours in the game.
[07:22.38]and then they really need you to just be better.
[07:26.60]Okay, so let me ask you a very, very important question.
[07:30.68]yes if I got over the fur if I got over it the first 10 hours would I like it if I kind of understood it like you do now that what you know about I think the parts that are thrown in your face of like the stance switching and the key pulsing you kind of naturally you kind of get after a while after the first day like it kind of just I don't really even think about it anymore okay but it's also really not as important as people would make you think okay
[07:57.96]Because there's tons of times on my stream where it's like, I will attack something and like, dude, he's never keep up.
[08:01.76]When is he going to do the keep pulse to get his stamina back?
[08:04.07]But it's like, they're going to die anyway.
[08:07.71]So it doesn't matter.
[08:08.19]Like, yeah, it's just like, whatever.
[08:09.23]Yeah.
[08:09.65]It's like, I feel like the same thing would happen.
[08:11.25]I don't know.
[08:11.85]Random comparison.
[08:12.91]Slay the Spire where like, you know, you have lethal next turn.
[08:17.46]So you just sort of end turn, even though you could have ended it this turn, but they can't hurt you because you have armor.
[08:21.56]Hold on though.
[08:23.20]I played Slay the Spire until it got too complicated where I was like, I don't care anymore.
[08:26.92]Okay.
[08:28.93]Once it got to be like I had to do five different math problems in a row, I was like, I think I'll just do something else.
[08:35.77]I think I'll play something else.
[08:36.80]I think we'll play as some Vampire Survivors.
[08:38.70]I think I unlocked... I love how that's an insult, though.
[08:44.72]I mean, just, you know, I don't really want to, like, do anything.
[08:49.41]After I unlocked the poison, there was a poison character and that was really fun.
[08:53.29]But then the game got like really hard.
[08:54.77]And I was just like, yeah, that was fun.
[08:56.43]I like completed a few runs and I'm kind of done.
[08:59.71]Well, that's what I mean.
[09:00.61]You know, like you can poison the enemy and you know next turn they're going to die to poison.
[09:04.75]Is your thing on the ground?
[09:07.25]I don't even have the game open.
[09:11.27]Mr. Rush rushing to get ready.
[09:13.45]He's not in the game.
[09:16.12]I'm not rushing.
[09:19.01]I thought you said you, I thought you said you like jumped up and like panicked and were like, I got to get on there.
[09:23.29]I got to get my stream ready.
[09:24.35]That panic is over.
[09:26.53]Oh, okay.
[09:26.89]So now you're just chilling.
[09:27.55]That was a while ago.
[09:28.37]Yeah.
[09:28.75]Then I realized that was an hour early.
[09:31.69]Like an hour and a half early.
[09:33.33]You were really early at that point.
[09:37.27]Yeah.
[09:37.67]I'm ready to go.
[09:38.51]Whenever you get your sign up.
[09:39.17]You launched the game with the mod, that thing.
[09:41.75]I did.
[09:43.91]I was very prepared.
[09:46.05]Hey, dude, it's not even 2 o'clock.
[09:48.43]It's 1.54 right now.
[09:50.53]Ooh, on time.
[09:51.99]With some pregame.
[09:55.53]And I said this to you, the buttons for dodge roll is, like, switched in NEO.
[10:00.75]And it's, like, hard switched.
[10:02.07]Like, you can't.
[10:03.29]Oh, that's right.
[10:03.69]You said, hey, dude, like, please, like, make sure you play well today because I'm not going to even know the buttons of Elden Ring.
[10:08.57]That's what you said.
[10:10.13]I'm a little concerned that I'm gonna be trying to keep pulse and stuff so I maybe I do just like get some magic and watch you for a little bit well I think we're alright our characters are pretty beefed up now yeah let's give a quick recap so I I can do that because you've played a different video game for like 50 straight hours since we last talked
[10:36.52]So, we were at the Volcano Manor.
[10:39.00]We were browsing around, doing a little bit of, you know, an investigation to see where we were going to go next.
[10:45.63]And I think we ended up saying that we were going to do Rykard, right?
[10:50.17]That's the plan?
[10:51.15]That was the goal.
[10:52.42]We never found Volcano Manor.
[10:54.24]We were kind of on our way there.
[10:56.72]Yeah, so we're in the vicinity.
[11:00.34]And I think the last thing that happened is you left...
[11:03.78]audibly laughed at the character that was the the mage character that you thought was a randomized character but it's where you get the comet azure I think that's the last thing we did and I forget what that is is it see the water terminus I think I have no idea the words you're saying subterranean inquisition chamber yokai shift
[11:26.57]I opened my... Wait, I... Where are we teleporting?
[11:29.25]And then you can join me.
[11:30.57]Okay, we are... I seriously... What button interacts with the bonfire?
[11:35.70]What?
[11:36.10]Why?
[11:36.66]What?
[11:37.06]It's Y. Oh, no.
[11:42.63]He doesn't even know the buttons of the game.
[11:45.60]Okay.
[11:47.91]Here's the thing, though.
[11:48.67]I get exactly where you're coming from, though.
[11:51.75]It's just on the controller for, like, an Xbox controller.
[11:54.19]B and A are reversed.
[11:56.29]And for the first, like, two or three hours of Nioh, I was like, I hate this.
[12:00.17]I hate this.
[12:02.05]Have you played Hi-Fi Rush, by the way?
[12:05.62]No.
[12:06.09]Okay, a lot of people wanted me to play it.
[12:07.29]They were like, stream it, stream it.
[12:08.15]What they don't know is, like, I got Game Pass.
[12:10.73]And I'm already in it.
[12:11.93]The game's fucking incredible, by the way.
[12:14.97]But right bumper is dodge in that game.
[12:18.59]And because I've been playing that, right bumper, I kept trying to hit B. And it just kind of doesn't work.
[12:25.13]So I might be in the same boat for a little while.
[12:27.83]Okay, we'll see how our dodging goes.
[12:29.66]Yeah, my brain got reprogrammed.
[12:32.01]Dude, Game Pass, seriously, Xbox... I remember like a few years ago during one of those conferences when they were just talking about this thing they wanted to do.
[12:40.53]Let me just go over it.
[12:41.39]I know, people are gonna say, oh, he loves Game Pass.
[12:43.05]He's a Game Pass Andy.
[12:44.99]Monster Hunter Rise, Hi-Fi Rush, and GoldenEye have all come out in the last, like, two weeks on Game Pass.
[12:53.32]That's fucking ridiculous.
[12:55.38]That's actually ridiculous.
[12:56.54]Like, that service is unbelievable.
[13:00.83]Wait, is there a GoldenEye like remaster or something?
[13:03.80]Yeah, they did like a GoldenEye HD kind of remaster.
[13:07.29]Oh, I thought I know there was like a fan version at some point.
[13:09.85]I never heard of this one.
[13:11.69]Yeah.
[13:12.55]I'm just, I'm just saying, I'm just saying it exactly the way that I see it.
[13:16.77]Xbox.
[13:17.99]Remember when Phil Spencer was on that stage and everyone was like, oh, Game Pass, it's gonna... I resent anything I ever said negatively about him.
[13:24.77]I respect anything he says because he is the most rectangular man I have ever seen.
[13:29.25]Is that... I don't even know what that means.
[13:33.43]He is fucking squared off.
[13:37.48]You know what I'm saying?
[13:39.45]like because of phil spencer I started calling myself the cubic man because I aspire to be as square as him I want like you know what they go for the measurement of like one cubic meter of like I I am one cubic meter of man I am the exact measurement or well phil spencer is but I want to be like him
[14:05.40]Alright.
[14:06.30]But yeah, I mean, I would say... Why are you talking about him like he's a Minecraft character?
[14:15.58]He is.
[14:21.34]Wait, my camera's... Dude, he walks on stage and there's cracks in the floor.
[14:26.48]What's wrong with my camera?
[14:27.28]There's a gap that I have to close?
[14:29.26]Oh, sorry about that.
[14:30.44]How did you even see that?
[14:31.67]What?
[14:36.00]but anyways game pass they got this cloud gaming thing and it's so I'm telling you I would not be saying this if I didn't believe it game pass is legit it's the real deal it's the real deal believe believe it can you not afford games no it's just look
[14:55.04]I have this problem with video games.
[14:57.51]There are a lot of them, okay?
[14:59.47]There are a lot of video games, a lot of stuff releases, indie games, AAA games.
[15:04.23]It's like, I don't fucking even know what the hell is even, I don't even know what I want to do.
[15:07.45]So what happens is Game Pass just dumps once every couple weeks.
[15:10.76]Sometimes it's one week, sometimes it's three weeks, but at least once a month, at least once or twice a month.
[15:15.62]Can you get multiverses on that?
[15:19.81]Multiverses is free.
[15:23.31]Multiverses is already for free.
[15:25.47]I didn't know that.
[15:26.39]Alright.
[15:26.65]Well, yes, you can.
[15:28.65]But anyways, having the option just to have, like, hey, there's four or five games that are here right now.
[15:37.53]Open them right now.
[15:38.85]Just play one right now.
[15:40.01]And just with the cloud shit, just open it.
[15:42.03]You don't have to install it.
[15:42.93]You don't have to like, oh, let me go read reviews.
[15:44.97]No, no, no.
[15:45.41]Oh, like for instance, like the Persona games.
[15:48.13]It's like a shadow play.
[15:49.49]You don't even have to download it.
[15:51.29]You can.
[15:52.75]That's the best part.
[15:53.89]If you open one of these up and you're like, you know what?
[15:55.55]That was actually really fun.
[15:56.29]I like that.
[15:57.09]Just hit the install button.
[15:58.73]Your save file continues.
[16:02.08]You don't have to worry about like, oh, I got to start over.
[16:03.84]No, you don't.
[16:05.32]I'm telling you, I will be an Xbox Game Pass fan here.
[16:11.84]You can be a fan.
[16:12.56]It's cool to like things.
[16:13.50]Yeah.
[16:14.78]But I will say it's definitely one of those things.
[16:16.72]It feels like a Netflix.
[16:18.39]Like I can just get on there and be like, what's on Game Pass today?
[16:21.05]By the way, there's like 100 plus other games that just are on there permanently.
[16:26.73]Plenty of good ones lately.
[16:27.39]You should be getting paid for this.
[16:30.13]No, I don't.
[16:30.75]I shouldn't because I just like it.
[16:35.03]What were you saying?
[16:36.07]Any good ones lately?
[16:36.89]Any, like, you tried something on Game Pass you wouldn't have tried, but you actually liked it a lot.
[16:41.63]Yes.
[16:43.29]And it's not, like, a mobile game called, like, Tar Pit or whatever.
[16:47.49]Gunfire Reborn.
[16:49.78]It's pretty good.
[16:50.42]Gunfire Reborn was just on Game Pass.
[16:52.16]Just opened it, and I was like, this is kind of fun.
[16:53.88]And I played it for, like, at least probably four or five days.
[16:58.80]Dang.
[17:01.64]And also, Monster Hunter Rise is on there.
[17:04.61]I was actually kind of thinking about starting that engine back up.
[17:07.71]Oh, Monster Hunter.
[17:08.53]Wait, really?
[17:09.23]I'm just going to open it.
[17:11.85]Fuck it.
[17:16.13]Fuck it.
[17:17.07]Who cares?
[17:17.73]There's no pressure.
[17:18.41]Just open it.
[17:19.86]Who's going to stop you?
[17:21.88]Is it usually pressure?
[17:26.04]Who's like, excuse me, sir.
[17:27.66]You cannot play Monster Hunter Rise today.
[17:30.04]Monster Hunter?
[17:31.04]Really?
[17:33.88]He's not going to stream it?
[17:35.34]Maybe I will.
[17:35.86]I don't know.
[17:37.38]Alright.
[17:38.20]Have you opened the game at this point?
[17:39.84]Yes.
[17:40.38]I said that I put the thing down.
[17:41.79]You can join me.
[17:42.47]I've just been fucking walking around the bonfire.
[17:44.59]Alright.
[17:45.05]Let's go.
[17:45.67]The Grace.
[17:46.11]Excuse me.
[17:46.73]Honestly, and high fire rush too.
[17:48.39]I...
[17:50.12]That was just a surprise launch.
[17:52.72]They were just like, oh yeah, by the way, this game exists and it's here now.
[17:57.28]No, no.
[17:58.60]Yes.
[17:59.54]I was reading all the reviews of Hi-Fi Rush and all of them were like, can you believe this like silent drop?
[18:04.89]It's crazy.
[18:05.59]This is silent, silent drop.
[18:07.87]Bethesda's like official game conference.
[18:10.03]Their like biggest thing that they do to like announce all our new games and they announced it at their biggest conference.
[18:15.68]How is that silent?
[18:17.20]Did you watch the Bethesda conference?
[18:19.20]I did.
[18:23.25]Well, silent in the way that there was no release date and it's just like, oh, hey, here's like the gameplay launch trailer and you can play it right now.
[18:30.59]I think that's immediate.
[18:34.15]That's why the English language is very different, very specific.
[18:36.70]Yeah, but that's cool, though.
[18:38.64]Okay, look, maybe not like, oh, wow, what a silent stealth launch.
[18:42.41]Do you think it's cool to have a gameplay trailer, like a launch trailer, and they're like, oh, by the way, you can download it now?
[18:46.75]Okay, so like if you didn't announce that you were going to do a scream stream, and one day you just show up and you just start screaming, is that a silent drop of a screaming stream?
[18:56.27]Well, that depends.
[18:56.85]Did it take me like three to four years to prepare the scream stream?
[19:02.17]Like, how big is that?
[19:04.63]Of course not.
[19:05.79]So, I don't think it makes... No, I don't think that works.
[19:07.57]Alright, hold up.
[19:08.83]How do you run?
[19:11.33]Fucking what?
[19:16.63]Alright, dude.
[19:17.52]I mean, I know how to do that.
[19:19.26]No, seriously.
[19:19.98]How do you run?
[19:20.74]I'm not joking.
[19:21.80]It's B. You hold B?
[19:24.84]Okay.
[19:26.14]He's not pretending.
[19:28.74]How do you get on the horse?
[19:31.26]Oh, that's a little more complicated.
[19:32.52]Hold Y, and then you probably have it mapped to up, down, left, or right on your D-pad.
[19:36.86]Okay.
[19:39.94]This is going to be a... I can't believe I deleted my entire memory of, like, how to play this.
[19:44.62]Dude, it is gone.
[19:45.64]Your memory, it's gone.
[19:47.52]I know we were going up left, and there was the lava lake there, and I think there's a... Yeah, we actually need to... We need to go back.
[19:57.11]I think we need to, like, actually wrap around here.
[20:00.31]Like, we're on the right side, right?
[20:01.49]Thought it was left.
[20:04.31]I don't think we... There's a path up left where we left off.
[20:06.15]Can we get up here this way?
[20:12.89]People just quietly looking at our chats.
[20:16.09]Hey, do we get up that way?
[20:17.77]I wanna go.
[20:20.21]So, wait.
[20:20.73]This one... This one down here?
[20:22.48]Do you see that dude holding a shield in front of us?
[20:24.38]Do you see the shield?
[20:29.27]Like, look at the shield.
[20:30.11]Isn't that finding Nemo?
[20:33.29]Where?
[20:34.97]Straight, straight.
[20:35.97]I'm walking straight towards him.
[20:37.11]There's a bug.
[20:39.25]Oh, that's a bug.
[20:39.89]I thought that was a guy holding a shield.
[20:41.79]Okay, I'm... You want to, like, start this back up tomorrow?
[20:47.82]Are you good?
[20:48.68]You want to start this up tomorrow?
[20:50.58]Looks like Nemo.
[20:51.64]Oh, my God, dude.
[20:54.02]Did you get any sleep?
[20:55.00]Tell me the truth.
[20:56.08]I didn't know.
[20:57.72]He didn't get any sleep.
[20:58.88]Alright.
[20:59.58]How about this?
[21:00.07]This is what we're going to do.
[21:01.93]We're just going to chill out.
[21:03.35]Alright.
[21:04.01]We're going to just chill out for a little while.
[21:05.51]We're going to just relax.
[21:07.71]We'll play for a few hours.
[21:10.27]No, no, no.
[21:10.97]I'm good.
[21:11.41]It'll just take a second.
[21:12.27]Trust and follow me.
[21:13.33]Oh, no.
[21:13.79]I don't know about this.
[21:15.13]I don't know about this.
[21:16.29]I know where I'm going.
[21:17.13]I have memory.
[21:17.94]I just don't... My muscle memory of buttons is off.
[21:21.72]We need to go to Primeval Sorcerer Azur.
[21:26.49]I don't want you to... Okay, I would not be following you right now.
[21:29.99]No way.
[21:30.89]I'm not going to follow the sleep-deprived guy that's like, yeah, let's walk through the fire on the ground.
[21:35.73]Yeah, we killed the thing.
[21:37.47]We killed the boss here, the mariner.
[21:39.47]No, we got to go to the sorcerer person's body.
[21:41.65]No, no, no.
[21:42.11]On the other side.
[21:42.81]Come with me.
[21:43.19]Oh, no.
[21:43.51]You're following me.
[21:44.25]No, you're following me.
[21:45.05]Uh-oh.
[21:45.41]I'm leading.
[21:46.03]I'm the commander.
[21:46.97]You don't have authority here.
[21:48.55]Okay.
[21:49.31]You are the sub.
[21:50.62]okay okay so here's what's gonna happen here this path we were gonna go do you drink coffee bro like do you drink coffee no you don't it doesn't even drink coffee like do you drink tea uh sometimes we get you like a nice green tea brew
[22:07.93]I take caffeine pills.
[22:11.36]No, you don't.
[22:13.16]What?
[22:14.50]I do.
[22:15.56]No, you don't take caffeine pills.
[22:18.00]You don't take those.
[22:19.32]Jerma, like an old man, I literally have in front of me a Monday to Sunday pill holder, and there are caffeine pills, one for each day.
[22:30.19]Alright, but hold on a minute.
[22:31.43]We need to do a little.
[22:32.33]Maybe we shouldn't do this assessment on broadcast.
[22:35.59]No, that's fine.
[22:36.65]Okay.
[22:37.85]How many milligrams of caffeine are in each one of those?
[22:39.66]200.
[22:40.94]Okay.
[22:44.74]But I've heard it does not feel like 200.
[22:49.41]Digesting it like that, if you don't take it on an empty stomach, then you don't get a full power.
[22:54.87]Alright.
[22:56.05]But you just don't like the taste of coffee or tea or anything like that?
[23:00.00]You have tried to get me to drink coffee before.
[23:02.68]You ordered me your favorite drink at Dunkin' one time in Boston.
[23:07.54]You fucking hated it.
[23:09.16]I did.
[23:09.42]I hated it.
[23:11.14]I've tried a lot of different coffee.
[23:13.04]It's all just like, why did you guys burn the shit out of this?
[23:16.11]Okay, so we are going the absolute wrong way.
[23:18.47]No, this is right.
[23:23.62]But you got to watch out because they like they have more stamina in the Yokai realm.
[23:29.43]Dude, you look in a dead sleep and you like ripped yourself out of bed to come over here and talk about how you like eat caffeine pills every day.
[23:37.27]The block button is different too.
[23:40.41]I'm just randomly jumping.
[23:42.70]People watching my stream.
[23:45.82]Like I entered combat, attacked, jumped, backstepped.
[23:50.34]Like I don't know what's going on.
[23:54.19]Alright, so, hey, listen to me.
[23:56.41]I want you to open up your menu.
[23:57.91]And I want you to go to... Primeval Sorcerer Azur.
[24:02.01]That's... No, we're going this way.
[24:05.50]Okay.
[24:06.42]But in a minute, we're gonna... We're gonna go to... Get on your donkey.
[24:11.88]Let him cook.
[24:13.04]Are you sure about that?
[24:14.14]I don't know about that.
[24:17.60]Let me cook.
[24:25.74]I mean... If I die before you do, that's going to be embarrassing.
[24:30.17]I could be you.
[24:32.49]What, like right now?
[24:34.09]Yeah, you were going to give me an assessment?
[24:36.19]Okay, my assessment is... So is that the only caffeine you're taking in a day?
[24:41.35]Yeah.
[24:41.97]Alright.
[24:42.27]That's okay then.
[24:43.23]But... There are some teas.
[24:46.01]And there are some... You can like... There are like drinks you can drink.
[24:49.05]That aren't just like 200 milligrams of just caffeine.
[24:51.23]They got like vitamins and like hydration and shit if you really want it.
[24:55.00]I had a... I have a... I had matcha tea this morning.
[24:57.88]Okay.
[24:57.98]Matcha green tea.
[24:58.90]Alright.
[24:59.50]Big fan.
[25:00.06]I used to make it myself, but then I got lazy.
[25:02.74]Well, that's exactly what I was just gonna tell you to do.
[25:04.99]Yeah.
[25:07.94]I would drink a few matchas a day rather than take it.
[25:13.10]A few a day?
[25:14.18]You know how much caffeine is in a matcha?
[25:16.58]Not 200.
[25:17.00]Probably like 40, 50.
[25:19.35]I'm telling you the 200 is fake.
[25:20.85]What do you mean fake?
[25:25.09]It's not real.
[25:26.75]It is 200, but like I'm saying, it's not real.
[25:29.27]It's not too real.
[25:29.83]It's not real.
[25:30.23]Alright, we'll rest here.
[25:31.31]We did a full circle.
[25:34.60]also if I literally take one sip of like a five hour energy that's what happened on myriad day I I one little sip of five hour energy like like 1 20th of a bottle it it fucks me up and I'm like wired and can't sleep for a day or two where we're going uh
[25:53.86]Yeah, I don't.
[25:56.06]One of the reasons why I can't drink stuff like Red Bull, really, or fiber energy or pretty much anything that has the like just caffeine in it.
[26:07.15]We are going the wrong way.
[26:08.53]Yeah, but it's OK.
[26:09.61]It's alright.
[26:10.73]No, we've already been up here.
[26:12.75]We did a full circle.
[26:14.33]Wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:15.35]Trust.
[26:15.73]Trust.
[26:16.03]Cook.
[26:16.55]They say cook.
[26:17.69]Keep cooking.
[26:18.21]Alright.
[26:18.61]Well, then the other one that's at the stove.
[26:20.49]Let's go.
[26:22.27]Okay, so everyone's like, what's the Duncan order?
[26:24.63]What's the Duncan order?
[26:25.29]Is this what I... No, we've been this way because we fought the fucking Great Putrid Slob up here.
[26:30.17]We did.
[26:30.49]And we're just going the long way back and around in a complete circle to that sorcerer who is up here.
[26:37.59]And we could have ported there, but you were at stove and I just kind of let you go.
[26:41.45]Because here he is.
[26:42.87]I've spent 1,000 souls.
[26:43.65]I feel like I should spend these.
[26:45.01]Alright, well, spend your souls.
[26:46.39]Let's go.
[26:52.59]We have switched personalities, like, for real.
[26:55.93]Alright, so now we have to go, like, around this way.
[26:59.14]Like, around here.
[27:01.60]That's correct, right?
[27:02.40]We go, like, around this right side.
[27:07.44]That's correct.
[27:09.58]I will follow you anywhere.
[27:10.80]Yeah, we want to go, like, around.
[27:13.21]Okay.
[27:13.37]Let him bake.
[27:22.44]baking does take longer baking takes a little longer that's right oh you want to go down into the fucking hero's grave we could the worst dungeons in Elden Ring wait is this the one with the lava and the the chariot I think this is actually yeah this might be like one of the worst most painful dungeons in the game yep I don't want to do it you're really gonna nope out no I think this is the worst dungeon in Elden Ring it's absolutely this is the worst dungeon in the whole game
[27:51.74]I think what with me randomly jumping and backstepping, I think we can do it.
[27:56.28]I think the last 15 minutes of this stream starting has proven to me personally that we should not walk down this hallway.
[28:04.57]What if the chariots are randomized and we don't even have to worry about them?
[28:08.75]Alright.
[28:09.31]Let's do it.
[28:10.91]That actually, that was enough for me to say, yeah, let's do it.
[28:17.80]people watching my perspective seriously take note of how many times I jump I have not done it on purpose once oh I thought you were just doing the thing where you like jump around iron forge no every time I jump I think I'm running I just I think I'm doing something else and if I ever do this sword I think I'm blocking
[28:37.34]So what you're saying is now you have a great excuse when you go back to Nioh 2 after playing this for a while, you can do like a 30 to 40 minute complaint stream in the first 40 minutes of that stream talking about how you relearned these abilities.
[28:50.87]It's genius.
[28:53.76]I don't know.
[28:54.52]Uh, sit at this.
[28:55.88]Oh.
[28:56.94]Wall penis?
[28:58.54]Um, nah.
[29:00.20]It's not there.
[29:03.48]Okay, my Duncan order.
[29:05.90]It's a large blueberry iced coffee with only a few sugars.
[29:10.89]Wait, you said you were going to assess me, and your assessment of me was telling me to drink tea.
[29:17.47]That was it.
[29:18.53]I just want to go back for a second.
[29:19.96]My assessment would be to tell you to stop taking caffeine pills.
[29:24.58]Okay, but what if I stop, and then I don't feel good because I haven't taken one?
[29:28.42]Alright, man.
[29:30.50]Wait.
[29:33.46]Well, okay.
[29:34.30]Can they be... Can they be, like, cut in half?
[29:39.10]Yeah.
[29:40.26]Alright, so... I've gone half these before.
[29:42.40]Yeah.
[29:42.94]So do that for a while.
[29:44.61]Then cut that in half.
[29:45.67]And then once you get used to, like, that 50-ish milligrams... I think you're good just drinking tea, man.
[29:52.07]You don't gotta do... You don't gotta... Caffeine pills are... Watch out.
[29:55.28]Oh, yeah.
[29:55.44]I forgot.
[29:57.24]I forgot.
[30:02.10]Why did we come down here?
[30:03.18]I don't know.
[30:03.58]You said it was going to be randomized.
[30:05.94]Oh, fuck.
[30:09.68]Dude, you're not going to make it.
[30:13.62]You're going to get fucking squished again on the way back.
[30:17.22]How do I heal?
[30:19.33]It's X. How do I equip it?
[30:23.43]What do you mean?
[30:24.05]Down on the D-pad?
[30:25.59]I'm jumping.
[30:27.60]Alright.
[30:28.20]You have fucking me up so bad.
[30:29.82]You have no idea.
[30:30.60]Did he just run you over again?
[30:32.70]No.
[30:32.76]I don't want to lose my Amarita.
[30:40.81]Are you down here?
[30:42.13]I'm coming.
[30:43.03]You freaked me out so bad.
[30:44.09]I didn't know what to do.
[30:44.93]I'm further than you.
[30:46.09]Yeah, because you were like freaking out and you were all like you were like caffeinated and ran down here.
[30:51.43]OK, I think you're weird that you drink more than one coffee a day.
[30:58.13]Poppy to me.
[30:59.33]I'm not going to lecture you in front of all your fans who are going to back you up and make me feel like... Look what you've done!
[31:06.48]Look what you've done!
[31:07.84]We're good.
[31:12.44]Okay.
[31:14.40]Where are you?
[31:15.82]Trying to remember how to heal.
[31:17.72]Where do we go?
[31:18.70]We're going to go this way, I think.
[31:21.13]You can go all the... I went all the way down.
[31:22.99]You can go down further, and there's cool items and shit, but I don't think we really care about that.
[31:26.71]Like walk in the lava?
[31:29.40]yeah I think if there's like a spot you can go down there let's just go this way I don't is the chariot not one shot anymore yeah I don't know maybe we're supposed to be I do remember killing like I'm surprised we lived through one yeah that is weird
[31:48.13]But anyways, drinking coffee for me is... This is kind of loud, isn't it?
[31:53.89]Turn this down.
[31:57.11]I will in a second.
[31:58.67]Coffee is more of a thing to kind of sip and relax with and... What is it?
[32:05.73]I've never played a game worse on stream.
[32:08.57]Every time I went to block, I just drank an elixir.
[32:11.33]I drank like three flasks to fight a rat when my health was full.
[32:15.01]So you really weren't kidding when you were like, hey, dude, I really don't knock on the buttons help.
[32:19.02]It's worse than I thought.
[32:20.42]Wow.
[32:22.12]I really have like a good talent.
[32:24.70]I'll say normally a talent for absolutely discarding any information the moment it's like not useful.
[32:31.08]So like I discarded Elden Ring.
[32:32.70]It's in the fucking recycle bin.
[32:34.53]That is really interesting.
[32:43.13]that's kind of loud a little loud why is it so loud it wasn't like this before alright but yeah why is it so loud okay that's better uh yeah
[33:03.68]I drink coffee not necessarily for the caffeine.
[33:07.16]I like just kind of like sipping on something.
[33:10.20]Just like a hot beverage.
[33:11.86]You're like, oh yeah, that's nice.
[33:14.64]But most days it's whiskey.
[33:17.10]I'll be honest.
[33:18.26]That's like another reason.
[33:19.56]Like, oh, whiskey.
[33:20.38]Oh, I'm just going to like.
[33:22.87]Oh, whiskey.
[33:23.61]I'm going to drink it.
[33:25.77]What?
[33:26.85]That was, I don't know.
[33:28.37]It was a pretty loud for you.
[33:30.15]Usually they're not that loud.
[33:31.31]Really?
[33:32.71]I don't know.
[33:33.28]They hit me weird.
[33:35.08]That hit me weird?
[33:37.86]You're farming for worse noise again.
[33:44.15]That actually, like, in real life did, like, Sonic damage to me.
[33:50.10]Okay, you're fucking me up so bad.
[33:52.48]I've drank more flasks in this dungeon than I have, like, the entire time I've played Elden Ring.
[33:57.96]Did you know you could do that?
[34:01.20]Yeah, I didn't.
[34:06.40]What now, dude?
[34:07.18]I don't remember.
[34:09.63]Watch out, the fire.
[34:11.45]Oh, it's fire.
[34:11.93]No fire that way.
[34:12.47]Okay.
[34:13.47]Watch out, chariot.
[34:14.63]I'm following you.
[34:15.47]I think we can follow this one up, I think, if we wanted to.
[34:18.50]But I don't know.
[34:19.44]I'm afraid.
[34:19.78]I just want to fight the boss.
[34:28.65]Okay, I'm going to die.
[34:34.93]Oh, that's not where that is.
[34:37.19]Let's just leave.
[34:37.63]Oh, you died too?
[34:39.72]Okay, yeah, let's fucking, let's go.
[34:41.56]I thought that, you know that level where you can go inside and there's like the two little places on either side of the chariot that are down and you go in and I thought it was right there.
[34:53.71]Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.
[34:57.21]Like immediately.
[35:06.57]It was the right place, but it was the wrong side.
[35:08.29]Oh, shit.
[35:09.17]Whatever.
[35:15.87]But yeah, coffee is more of a sipping thing.
[35:17.95]Just like this.
[35:18.87]This is like hydration.
[35:21.69]I just like, I gotta move my hands around.
[35:28.05]I relate to the move your hands around, but not the put it in my mouth part.
[35:31.79]Well, the thing is, it's really good that I and I know that like obviously like cigarettes are one of those things that a lot of people go like, yeah, I just always I kind of wanted to have something just like in my hand and like something to do with my pain and whatever.
[35:43.59]And I'm so glad that I never, ever, ever thought to try cigarettes because I probably would one of those be one of those people that was like, oh, yeah, I just need it to have it in my hand and just something to do.
[35:54.20]I'm glad I never fucking ever thought to ever do it.
[36:07.51]What are you doing over there?
[36:16.57]It's worse that I'm self-aware.
[36:18.13]It's like the self-consciousness of what I'm doing is making it worse.
[36:25.14]I'm giving myself a headache.
[36:26.74]You sure those are caffeine pills?
[36:28.39]Those aren't something else?
[36:32.79]I just cast Thop's Barrier like six times and tried to cast a face thing with my staff like four.
[36:39.23]This thing is actually kind of hard.
[36:40.35]We need to be careful.
[36:43.47]He's taking mystery pills.
[36:48.16]He's taking mystery pills.
[36:51.42]You never want to...
[36:54.61]I got it.
[36:56.61]Where's my fucking sword?
[37:00.71]Alright, alright, hey, alright.
[37:03.08]It's alright, it's alright.
[37:05.06]Here's what we're gonna do.
[37:08.74]You... Just... Go into... You know what's probably better?
[37:11.94]I got a suggestion for you.
[37:16.14]What if you went into and changed the keybinds to make it just NEO 2?
[37:20.89]You sure?
[37:23.46]I'm sure.
[37:24.06]That's not a good idea?
[37:25.99]That's actually a really good idea.
[37:31.47]Because then you don't even have to think about it.
[37:33.51]Run is the same button.
[37:34.57]Jump is the same button.
[37:35.57]Swing is the same button.
[37:36.67]And that thing is actually pretty good, isn't it?
[37:41.86]I don't... I don't... I don't know.
[37:43.74]This sounds dangerous.
[37:47.28]What do you mean?
[37:49.10]Oh, changing, yeah.
[37:50.68]I don't know why, but it sounds dangerous.
[37:54.40]And I kind of want to overcome it.
[37:55.81]This is like getting over it.
[37:58.09]That kind of game.
[37:59.23]Well, there's a time for you to do it.
[38:00.21]It's definitely right now.
[38:02.91]Okay, so now... Make sure we're going the right way.
[38:05.60]I wish I could see the... Freaking map!
[38:17.79]I'm just going to need you to lead for a bit.
[38:20.17]Now we take a left.
[38:20.81]I will back you up.
[38:21.87]There's a boss up here, isn't it?
[38:23.87]There might be an item up here.
[38:27.42]Can you handle climbing this ladder?
[38:29.66]We'll see.
[38:30.96]You want me to go first?
[38:32.12]I would like for you to go first.
[38:41.78]We're all good.
[38:43.60]Part of me was hoping that you were going to get sniped.
[38:46.27]If we go into a boss fight and you die, I am going to try harder than I've ever tried in the game to beat it anyway.
[38:54.41]Just so I can be the winner.
[38:57.04]That's fine.
[38:58.44]It's a good thing.
[39:01.54]So I may be completely incompetent, but I have the burning desire.
[39:08.94]And that usually works for anime.
[39:15.12]Yeah.
[39:16.15]Ooh, okay.
[39:18.19]Keep going.
[39:19.35]Let's do a race.
[39:19.93]Wait, ready?
[39:22.01]Hold on.
[39:23.07]We didn't do it.
[39:24.65]You're going to win any race.
[39:25.69]Because I'm going to jump instead of run.
[39:29.27]That's better.
[39:32.50]Jump.
[39:33.56]It'll be funny.
[39:34.06]Jump.
[39:35.84]I almost just did it.
[39:37.30]I almost just did it.
[39:39.22]I was thinking it was weird.
[39:40.62]My whole body was like, I'm going to do it.
[39:42.60]kill yourself I was like I'm gonna jump off that for no reason watch out bat I thought he was gonna walk off no I'm here to game
[40:10.02]You get a stacking bonus for the amount of things that you kill before returning to the shrine and praying.
[40:19.25]So I don't want to get hit.
[40:22.63]Oh, that's a Neo reference.
[40:26.49]Watch out!
[40:27.81]Watch out!
[40:33.64]I'm just going to embrace the jumping.
[40:35.44]Are we going uphill?
[40:36.71]Excuse me.
[40:37.11]I'm walking in my bike.
[40:38.41]Yeah, we're going the wrong way.
[40:39.19]We need to turn.
[40:39.61]We need to go on the road.
[40:43.76]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:45.85]I got an epic.
[40:47.09]Did you?
[40:47.43]Epic.
[40:48.68]Ah, hold on.
[40:49.14]I've got something that you are going to want to take a look at.
[40:51.68]I got the staff that I used a lot of the game.
[40:55.50]It's really sick.
[40:56.60]I have every staff in the game and one spell.
[40:59.76]I have gravity pull or whatever.
[41:01.64]But this one is the one that makes your spells cast way faster.
[41:04.48]This is the Azure's Glintstone staff.
[41:09.16]It reduces the casting.
[41:10.48]Alright.
[41:12.34]Yeah, you can climb that tower and throw it off.
[41:17.94]just like just javelin it over the edge yep alright alright there's a boss up here yeah are you prepared well all the way over the top is normally the uh meteorite meteor man and for us it's going to be radon that would actually be really bad if it was like Elden Beast if okay if Elden Beast is in the middle of this I'm gonna you're just gonna go to bed
[41:43.71]I'm gonna go to bed.
[41:44.71]No, I'm... You're gonna die and I'm gonna focus so hard and you're gonna see me jump and cast Thop's Barrier at nothing.
[41:51.50]But I'm still gonna beat it.
[41:52.44]Okay.
[41:54.62]It's gonna be... Oh my god.
[41:56.28]Please don't say that.
[42:00.63]Are you prepared, huh?
[42:02.11]Are you prepared, huh?
[42:14.23]I'm people it's it's rough I'm sorry alright I'll I'll get over saying it soon you're supposed to dodge roll in this game okay you know what you're asking me about neo I think this is actually the best comparison your first couple hours are going to be like this
[42:43.06]I'm dead.
[42:43.54]I just thought you'd jump over that.
[42:48.22]That actually helped you.
[42:49.12]You jumped over it.
[42:49.88]You didn't dodge it.
[42:50.44]Oh, I've got him now.
[42:55.16]Oh my god, we are so... This is so... Don't die.
[42:58.50]This is so fucking far away, dude.
[43:00.82]I can't die.
[43:02.61]Got him.
[43:05.99]Holy shit, this is so far away.
[43:08.17]Sorry, I looked over at your chat.
[43:09.07]Ster not even helping?
[43:10.23]The chimera is dead.
[43:12.56]Yeah, well, you took... You have, like, a legend next to your computer of, like, all the buttons written down while I was dodging and attacking and fighting and he was kicking the shit out of me.
[43:22.42]And you looked at your legend of moves you could do and then, like, 15 to 30 seconds later, you decided to help.
[43:29.40]I killed... There was a giant great wolf.
[43:31.80]Those wolves die in one hit.
[43:33.82]No, that's one of the big wolves.
[43:34.96]It took a lot of hits.
[43:37.44]Are you climbing?
[43:38.64]Are you coming back?
[43:39.56]I don't think you understand how far away I am.
[43:42.67]I am at the Gelmer's Hero Grave.
[43:45.14]That's the last bonfire we got.
[43:47.24]Oh.
[43:49.12]I thought there was a bonfire right here.
[43:51.80]Did you get it?
[43:52.22]Because I didn't get it.
[43:52.84]It may just be up the hill a bit.
[43:56.59]I know there's like a midway point.
[43:58.97]Alright.
[43:59.47]I'll be good.
[44:00.27]I'm coming.
[44:02.37]You better be good.
[44:04.19]I'm on my way.
[44:07.28]This time I'm just going to get right over there.
[44:10.36]No stopping.
[44:13.96]Get the maps.
[44:15.36]Yeah, that's... I don't know if that... I think that might be a little much for Ster right now.
[44:32.73]We'll get this one, at least.
[44:33.69]Oh, yeah.
[44:39.43]Wait, I've never played Elden Ring.
[44:40.29]Can I get a spoiler warning?
[44:41.97]Oh, shit.
[44:42.59]Yep.
[44:45.76]Ster will write it on his stream.
[44:49.16]What does that mean?
[44:51.28]Someone always wanted a spoiler warning because they haven't played this part and I said that you would just put it on yours.
[44:56.02]Okay, that's on mine.
[45:00.63]My stream has the Twitch plugin where anything that you haven't seen before in a game is covered with like a black box.
[45:06.95]That's so stupid.
[45:12.05]Oh.
[45:15.05]The spoiler extension.
[45:20.41]Oh, hey, welcome back.
[45:21.73]I'm back.
[45:22.35]Good of you to show up and finally start helping.
[45:25.20]I know.
[45:25.46]Alright.
[45:27.74]So we just got to get her.
[45:29.42]I think there's a bonfire somewhere over here.
[45:34.98]I just finished making a cardboard cutout of you.
[45:36.80]It watches me when I sleep.
[45:38.50]That's not strange at all.
[45:42.35]I thought there was like another ladder here, something.
[45:47.55]You should jump.
[45:50.33]You thought I was going to?
[45:51.37]It's the last thing they would expect.
[45:54.81]Alright, so we gotta, let's go over here.
[46:02.36]Is this down here?
[46:04.04]Alright, I think we...
[46:06.44]Let's keep going on.
[46:06.94]The ladder's right here.
[46:07.96]I know, I know.
[46:09.40]I think there's a bonfire, though.
[46:12.44]I knew where to go.
[46:13.32]No, it's up here.
[46:14.42]You're wrong.
[46:14.96]I knew where to go.
[46:18.76]Coffee you drank is kicking in.
[46:22.62]I swear there's one right here.
[46:26.22]Yeah, I think we are going to go up one more.
[46:29.95]Ooh.
[46:31.15]This is just ladder zone.
[46:38.57]I like it.
[46:51.86]Need to help your friend.
[46:54.32]My friend.
[46:56.24]What I said you need to help your friend.
[46:58.20]I'm beyond helping.
[47:02.53]You need to help him.
[47:03.57]Oh, no.
[47:05.67]Alright.
[47:07.03]Watch out.
[47:07.37]I think we, yeah, we go.
[47:09.99]I can do it.
[47:11.15]I think you're alright.
[47:12.01]I think you just maybe were a little nervous that you had to relearn the game.
[47:23.40]Everything seems fine now.
[47:26.39]We do have some enemies.
[47:31.47]Special enemies?
[47:36.96]Got some herb.
[47:38.68]Do you need any herb?
[47:39.64]There's already something like shooting this from a mile away.
[47:43.54]Oh, the flower.
[47:44.44]Beware.
[47:45.12]I thought that was actually like falling stars in the sky.
[47:48.04]And I was like, oh, that's a cool environmental effect.
[47:50.16]I should grab me.
[47:50.90]I thought I could hit it.
[47:51.50]You're so dead.
[47:53.58]I thought you were getting pelted by everything.
[47:56.98]Kind of was, but I'm alright.
[47:58.72]Are we fighting this?
[48:01.05]I mean, no, but that's destructible.
[48:06.85]These things are so annoying.
[48:08.31]I say no.
[48:11.49]Just get the heck out of here.
[48:12.31]Alright, cross the bridge, and then there's a bonfire right here.
[48:17.26]Yes, there is.
[48:18.22]And then we fight whatever is up here.
[48:20.54]Alright, let's both take a guess, and if one of us gets this right, then we owe the other one 50 bucks.
[48:26.62]It's kind of weird that you booted up your game early just to see what was up here.
[48:32.18]Pretend you don't have any of these graces.
[48:35.94]for fifty dollars that would be yeah uh I'm gonna alright I'm gonna say it's gonna be we haven't I'm just basically I've said for dawn I don't think so it would be it would be in the lore for him to be inside the crater probability wise we have not seen really that many ulcerated tree spirits and there's like 10 in the game so I'm gonna say an ulcerated tree spirit statistically speaking that's where I have the most odds
[49:06.51]It's, um... Oh, that could have... An Erdtree Avatar.
[49:13.27]Full-grown Erdtree Avatar, though.
[49:18.95]Yeah, this is a safe bet, too.
[49:20.28]This and the Ulcerated Tree Spirits.
[49:21.50]We've only seen, like, two of these.
[49:27.88]He's gonna die to an Ulcer.
[49:35.14]He's got a lot of health.
[49:47.76]Oh shit, I tried to dodge that.
[49:49.05]Didn't time it right.
[49:49.75]That was weird.
[49:57.11]That was really weird.
[50:01.19]I did not appreciate it.
[50:04.49]You know that you dodge faster if you're in low stance?
[50:08.91]What the fuck did I just get?
[50:10.95]Yeah, I got a weapon.
[50:12.55]Blue Feathered Branch Sword.
[50:15.11]I've never seen this item.
[50:16.13]Oh, you're going to take a look at this.
[50:25.64]That's pretty rare.
[50:26.26]Oh.
[50:42.32]Wait, you thought he was drinking a flask?
[50:46.32]You thought he was like... Yeah, he put his hand up and his staff on my screen went like behind his body.
[50:53.72]So it just looks like he put his hand to his empty head.
[50:55.94]I was like, he's drinking.
[50:56.84]God damn it.
[50:57.54]I don't want him to heal.
[50:58.52]That would be so funny if they could do that.
[51:01.53]Alright.
[51:02.49]Hold on a minute.
[51:03.83]What did I just get?
[51:04.67]I got like a weird rare key thing.
[51:08.99]Is it a weapon?
[51:09.33]I didn't even look.
[51:11.62]I think I got a pot.
[51:13.28]Was that actually a sword?
[51:16.47]What the hell was there?
[51:18.99]Is it talisman?
[51:25.67]Raises defense when HP is low.
[51:28.54]And then the other one was a talisman too, wasn't it?
[51:34.44]What the hell was that other thing?
[51:39.24]Did I get this thing?
[51:41.81]I think we're in the fire zone, though.
[51:43.81]I think I'm alright with this.
[51:51.03]Omen barn.
[51:53.05]Oh, yeah.
[51:53.71]I think it's a key, though, isn't it?
[51:54.76]I don't even know what that thing does.
[51:56.00]Alright, cool.
[51:56.88]I know that we're looking for, like, Smithing Stone fives is my breakpoint.
[52:02.40]Hey.
[52:02.66]Just want to let you know.
[52:06.14]What?
[52:08.18]Take a look at what's on the ground.
[52:09.98]No, seven.
[52:10.66]I need something seven.
[52:12.05]On the ground?
[52:14.49]Yeah, no, I need sevens.
[52:16.27]Oh, I thought I was helping you.
[52:17.25]Can I have those back?
[52:20.09]No.
[52:21.40]Let's go.
[52:21.70]Where are we going?
[52:22.80]How do we get to Volcano Manor?
[52:23.92]Alright, now we continue this way.
[52:26.86]We have to go over, like, here.
[52:30.50]Oh, yeah, there's, like, a walkway over here.
[52:38.14]It's not.
[52:38.94]It's like over here.
[52:39.76]Gold needle.
[52:49.55]Gravity stone fans.
[52:51.39]Oh, yeah.
[52:51.93]So you said you do not care at all about about magic anything, right?
[52:59.94]I would like some magic to cast potentially.
[53:02.96]Because I have a couple of talismans that you probably want.
[53:08.04]Do I have Smithing Stone sevens?
[53:09.34]Maybe I do.
[53:11.18]I feel like you looked a bunch of times last stream and didn't.
[53:15.16]Take a look on the ground.
[53:23.58]Oh, shit.
[53:24.92]Who's your favorite friend?
[53:28.09]It's you.
[53:28.41]Okay.
[53:29.87]Yep.
[53:30.29]No one else has given me Smithing Stone sevens.
[53:32.81]Dude, you just got frenzy flamed by the Three Fingers.
[53:37.42]You just got fucking three fingered, bro.
[53:47.02]No, that's an E3 fucking presentation.
[53:51.18]This is the E3 co-op presentation.
[53:53.81]Dude, you got three frenzy fingered by the Three Fingers.
[53:57.29]Whatever the fuck you said.
[53:58.27]That was just the E3 presentation.
[54:01.68]Dude, watch out.
[54:02.43]You're going to get frenzied by the Three Fingers.
[54:04.97]You're just trying to distract from the fact that I don't know any of the buttons and you've died more times.
[54:09.89]Yeah, but I have to like help you.
[54:12.35]I have to like guide.
[54:13.23]Somebody is lagging the game, by the way.
[54:16.04]Somebody?
[54:16.82]There's like... DDoS?
[54:18.04]No, there's another one of those like... Look over here and the game goes to 10 FPS creatures.
[54:24.04]Oh, there's like a look at me?
[54:26.00]Yeah, there's a look at me.
[54:28.02]Alright.
[54:28.63]Are we going?
[54:30.45]Are we?
[54:31.23]Wait.
[54:32.53]I'm not the one who got three fingered.
[54:37.34]You being like delirious tired is making me delirious tired.
[54:42.68]And I had a full night's sleep.
[54:44.30]I had like avocado tacos.
[54:46.74]I had like a nice coffee.
[54:48.56]I have fully hydrated.
[54:50.77]I'm fully well rested.
[54:52.99]You're turning me sleep deprived.
[54:56.51]I wish I had a knob that I could turn and just become sleepy.
[55:00.80]Or like, you know, like a mood controller.
[55:02.40]I wish I was a robot.
[55:03.50]That'd be awesome.
[55:03.92]I wish, you know, I'd sell my soul to Ubisoft.
[55:08.57]And they could plug me in.
[55:09.69]You know how, just how amazing that would actually be?
[55:13.07]If you could truly control, just like, you know what?
[55:14.95]It's time for me to go to bed.
[55:15.85]I can like go up into my internal like hard drive up here and be like, turn off and turn back on.
[55:22.16]Actually, that'd be terrible.
[55:22.92]What if like there was like an emergency?
[55:24.38]You reboot yourself?
[55:26.04]Yeah, I need a quick reboot, guys.
[55:27.78]Yeah.
[55:28.50]My like Wi-Fi is off.
[55:32.40]Yeah, I could go for some like mind control slash like invasion of privacy, like give up all my data type of situation if it meant that I could be sleepy when I want to.
[55:47.30]It's an avocado taco.
[55:48.41]It's just a taco.
[55:50.47]Like, I would take the risk that the communists could totally, like, activate me at any time.
[55:55.27]The communists.
[55:57.67]If it meant that I could, like, control my being.
[56:02.48]It's like, you know, the communists.
[56:04.44]Alright.
[56:06.50]Isn't one of these an illusionary wall?
[56:09.97]Eventually.
[56:10.61]All the way down at the end here.
[56:15.34]have to go in one of the rooms because you can't even I think we have to talk first we have to like say yes we're here well wait wait wait wait what this is the guy there's the guy upstairs who drops the uh thing if we could go kill the guy and see if he drops on elsa I don't know if you want to do that I like this outfit you gotta join the manor alright so we join the manor
[56:39.94]She gave me two golden seeds.
[56:41.62]Join the banner.
[56:43.14]I'm having twins.
[56:43.94]And a bell bearing.
[56:46.70]Nice.
[56:47.52]Alright.
[56:49.56]And then we go upstairs.
[56:51.24]Yeah.
[56:51.52]And there is that person to fight.
[56:53.19]It goes.
[56:59.03]Just like Bloodborne.
[57:00.47]You get invaded.
[57:04.53]Oh, Amidala.
[57:06.31]Or whatever he says.
[57:07.79]You know?
[57:09.23]Amidala.
[57:11.05]Have mercy on the poor boy.
[57:13.22]Have mercy on the poor bastard.
[57:20.02]I think that's what it is.
[57:26.86]This guy has like 10 million health.
[57:31.58]What is going on?
[57:34.08]That's a lot of health.
[57:34.92]No, it's being healed.
[57:38.42]Oh, because he seems to have the beast magic.
[57:40.88]There's a beast heal.
[57:42.14]I'm seriously jumping everything.
[57:43.47]Magic!
[57:45.17]Beast magic!
[57:47.87]He can't hit me.
[57:48.49]I'm a jumper now.
[57:51.55]Dude, why is my stamina going down when I keep holding?
[57:54.11]I've... Help!
[57:55.77]You're not helping!
[57:57.15]All the help that's been taken off in the last 15 straight seconds has been me, not you.
[58:02.30]Kind of doubting that.
[58:04.11]Wait, wait, wait.
[58:08.11]I'm going to use it.
[58:10.49]Ready?
[58:10.81]Oh, you're going to want to take a look at this.
[58:14.52]Yes!
[58:16.38]You just clean yourself with soap?
[58:17.86]Yeah.
[58:21.36]Dirty boy.
[58:31.22]First shower in months, yeah.
[58:37.08]Okay, so now we... Wait a minute.
[58:40.52]Nice.
[58:48.11]Don't get mad.
[58:49.01]I was very excited.
[58:51.67]Okay, so the door should be open technically now, right?
[58:56.49]One second.
[59:02.56]No?
[59:02.88]Oh, this one is.
[59:04.64]No?
[59:09.28]Do we have to come back?
[59:13.27]I think we have to reload the area.
[59:20.09]Oh, you might be right.
[59:23.87]You didn't get the drawing room key.
[59:25.57]We don't have the key to get in here.
[59:29.46]Oh, right.
[59:30.44]She does give a key.
[59:31.36]Oh, yeah.
[59:31.64]She gave me golden seeds so we don't have it.
[59:33.60]So now what?
[59:44.18]That's a good question.
[59:46.84]I know there's multiple ways to get in there.
[59:48.82]I think we can go around here.
[59:51.97]Let's get the map.
[59:52.53]I think we can go around the whole thing.
[60:04.24]Take the teleporter at the bottom of Rey Lucaria.
[60:07.21]We did that.
[60:08.35]Yeah, we did that.
[60:09.19]But were we supposed to go a different way from there?
[60:10.97]Yeah, we got killed at the bottom.
[60:20.18]And we have a teleporter down there.
[60:22.28]Is it safe to drop down here?
[60:25.24]Probably not.
[60:27.44]No.
[60:27.70]No.
[60:30.14]No.
[60:32.59]I want to do it so bad.
[60:33.59]I'm just so lazy.
[60:38.34]It's too far.
[60:38.88]I was testing it.
[60:39.60]That was a good test.
[60:43.58]I'll wait.
[60:55.58]Ready?
[60:56.02]Be careful.
[60:58.18]I am.
[61:01.24]Be careful.
[61:05.14]That's how it went for you every time too, right?
[61:08.59]I can't remember.
[61:11.75]Give Bloodborne on PC with a new DLC and a bunch of new weapons.
[61:22.99]Oh, so that's one of the so-called fall jokes.
[61:25.73]Interesting.
[61:28.71]Are you studying my stream?
[61:32.16]Why are you studying me?
[61:35.62]Well, apparently there's a replacement Jerma every now and again.
[61:40.40]Interesting writing notes.
[61:44.47]OK, so I gotta go a long way.
[61:46.61]Fine.
[61:48.83]You still haven't killed any of these invisible young Beatles.
[61:52.41]I haven't.
[61:54.21]I haven't killed any of them like this one is so easy, isn't it?
[61:57.53]Just let's get it because it could be something cool.
[62:01.91]Well, you're you're lingering flame you put on the ground.
[62:05.11]You could just like put that in the path.
[62:07.09]That's a good idea.
[62:15.81]Where is it?
[62:18.39]Going around you coming down here.
[62:20.41]You missed.
[62:29.62]Ow.
[62:39.52]It's just like impossible.
[62:40.84]It's like one pixel.
[63:07.00]Oh, that's why you do it.
[63:08.97]That's why you do it.
[63:10.41]That's why you do it.
[63:12.61]I just got the Black Knife.
[63:15.27]I've had that.
[63:15.93]You're lame.
[63:16.75]I got Elden Ring.
[63:17.65]The Elden Boss Remembrance.
[63:19.17]You got the Elden Beast Remembrance?
[63:21.05]Yeah.
[63:21.57]Ooh.
[63:22.29]See, it was worth it.
[63:23.12]Now, if we didn't do that, you... It was worth it.
[63:24.84]See?
[63:31.07]You can also jump across to the Volcano Manor interior from the place you get teleported to if you do a running jump.
[63:37.12]Really?
[63:37.42]Let's see what happens when we go this way.
[63:43.52]What's going on?
[63:53.47]I got another Smithing Stone 7.
[63:55.95]Ooh!
[63:57.05]I can get big pluses.
[63:58.37]Give it to me.
[63:59.03]Give it to me now!
[64:00.52]Drop it!
[64:01.58]There's no opportunity to do that.
[64:02.54]We're trying to get the map piece.
[64:05.38]I know what the map looks like already.
[64:06.93]No, you don't.
[64:08.19]I've got fucking IGN.com open.
[64:13.99]I'll drop it here.
[64:14.73]There's a boss down here.
[64:18.41]There is.
[64:22.08]It was patched.
[64:23.00]Oh.
[64:27.12]Actually, let me... Wait a minute.
[64:32.80]Hold on.
[64:35.00]There's 35,000 souls in the ground, I think, over here that I... Yeah, I'll be right back.
[64:39.98]Yeah, that adds up because we killed that boss.
[64:42.06]Yeah.
[64:47.25]Where the fuck is it?
[64:48.43]Is it where I fell?
[64:50.59]It's kind of strange that you left without giving me the Smithing Stone.
[64:54.37]I'll be right back.
[64:54.95]I'll just... I'll be right back.
[64:56.05]I feel like that's kind of selfish and you're showing a side of yourself I didn't know existed and I don't like it.
[65:01.16]Go fucking deal with it.
[65:04.57]How's that sound?
[65:07.93]Yeah, I'm glad people finally got a glimpse of what you're really like during the Christmas stream.
[65:12.62]Even though you're being recorded.
[65:16.06]Where are these?
[65:17.10]Where are they?
[65:17.78]Oh.
[65:19.85]Yeah, that would have been awful.
[65:20.77]That's 35,000 souls.
[65:21.33]That's a lot.
[65:22.05]Alright, I'm coming back.
[65:36.41]I will drop the stone.
[65:40.46]Well, then we have to, we got to travel.
[65:43.10]We have to move?
[65:45.04]Into where I can smith.
[65:46.80]Okay.
[65:47.94]We can get that situated.
[65:48.78]I need my smithing.
[65:50.26]Okay.
[65:52.86]Here is the, do you have any Somber Smithing Stone eights by chance?
[65:59.66]I believe I do, actually.
[66:01.10]That sounds like something I recall having in my inventory.
[66:03.93]Let me one briefly moment take a yonder look over at my sombers.
[66:07.83]I have an eight.
[66:09.29]Dude, then here we go.
[66:11.33]This is fucking perfect.
[66:12.73]Discard.
[66:16.46]Wait, which ones?
[66:18.40]Which ones?
[66:19.74]Okay, I'll just... No, we just picked them both up.
[66:22.14]Alright.
[66:23.34]I'm putting mine over here.
[66:28.11]Okay.
[66:29.23]I can go to plus nine now.
[66:30.43]So now we're going to be unstoppable.
[66:33.51]We are going to be genuinely unstoppable now.
[66:37.15]Let's go, Smith.
[66:43.70]Where is it?
[66:45.64]There it is.
[66:48.68]This dirt is actually fucking insane.
[66:55.87]True?
[66:56.83]I don't think so.
[66:59.74]because you want to be like the insane guy I'm taking like street crud away from you I was saying to my child I don't I don't even remember what I was saying that you're like I don't know you're trying to I don't know there's a conspiracy where you're trying to poison me but it backfired because it made me weirder but like you want it to be weird I don't know
[67:25.68]are you talking about what are you talking there's a conspiracy that I poisoned you yeah what's oh explain this conspiracy theory that I poisoned you last time we played Elden Ring you were like damn stirs like kind of funny like I feel like I'm losing some cred to him when we're like co-op oh I thought you meant like there was a point in the last like decade that we've known each other or I just trying to poison you oh okay no just last week
[67:52.70]Nah, just last week when I... Hold on a minute.
[67:54.44]I got... I'm almost at plus 10 with this thing.
[67:57.16]This thing is beefy now.
[68:01.69]Do you have any of the ancient dragon smithing stones?
[68:04.25]Somber ones?
[68:05.35]You actually have one of those?
[68:06.91]Yeah, I'm plus 25 on my sword.
[68:08.37]Dude, give me that somber ancient dragon Smithing Stone and I will be plus 10.
[68:11.84]Mine's a hollow.
[68:12.20]Here.
[68:12.36]Here.
[68:28.08]What are you giving me?
[68:30.03]I better not be a staff.
[68:43.34]Hello.
[68:43.68]The fuck was that?
[68:48.52]Thank you.
[68:49.00]Yeah, I treated you.
[68:49.90]I know that has sentimental value.
[68:51.61]It does.
[68:53.46]me strong just traded you his club that's something that that's that's a trinket that's worth isn't it isn't a club something just a staff plus 10 let's go um I mean that's something that that holds incredible like generational sentimental family value and I just I just gave it to you be strong club okay where are we going get back to where we were there's a boss there
[69:25.08]Uh, yes.
[69:27.18]I don't remember the name of it.
[69:28.22]It was... It was up here.
[69:31.44]It was... The 9th Mount Gelmir Campsite.
[69:37.18]You sure?
[69:38.84]I think it's the road of... Well, hold on.
[69:40.84]Let's get this right.
[69:41.66]Because if we can't get in there with the key, what is the best way for us to get there?
[69:45.63]Because we can't go to the manor because it's randomized.
[69:48.27]So we can't open the door.
[69:49.65]So how the fuck do we do this?
[69:51.39]Go to Seathwater Terminus.
[69:53.53]That's there.
[69:54.47]That has to be it.
[69:56.83]And also, I don't know.
[69:57.95]Apparently, we have to go through Raya Lucaria.
[70:00.61]We cannot get there any other way.
[70:02.05]We did that.
[70:02.71]So we should have the waypoints from down there.
[70:04.58]Because we did that.
[70:05.52]So let's get back down there, wherever that is.
[70:08.92]Was it subterranean?
[70:10.14]Inquisition chamber?
[70:11.44]Should be.
[70:17.34]Is this pre-recorded?
[70:19.46]Why would it be?
[70:19.86]Why would it be?
[70:22.50]imagine Ster if I was like hey dude like I don't really feel like streaming tomorrow but like let's like stream for like seven hours right now like pretend and then I'll just upload it tomorrow I thought about doing that a few times I've never done it something about it's funny to me that I could be sitting there watching my own stream and like laughing and enjoying my stream with everyone else you gotta stream on an alt channel of me watching my stream reacting to my stream
[70:51.23]We have to jump from here from the teleport.
[70:56.95]Are you going to do a jungle gym stream?
[71:00.01]What?
[71:06.72]Who said hello?
[71:07.72]Oh, I don't.
[71:08.14]People are like, that's people.
[71:09.82]Okay.
[71:10.10]I have no idea who that was.
[71:13.08]Wow.
[71:13.96]That's a diss.
[71:14.54]You don't know who that was.
[71:16.59]I don't know.
[71:18.03]What do you mean?
[71:18.39]He's going to feel bad.
[71:19.53]Wait, I wasn't even paying attention.
[71:21.35]Play it again.
[71:22.79]I can't.
[71:23.13]It's random.
[71:25.15]Hello?
[71:27.07]That was not the same person that just did that.
[71:28.85]Exactly.
[71:29.27]That's what I mean.
[71:30.17]You don't get a redo.
[71:34.21]Okay, so we're not in the right spot.
[71:37.05]I think we have to get to where we get ported to and then jump from where we get ported to.
[71:43.93]Well, that was further up.
[71:48.37]you played this before yeah but I've like had the key to open the door to the manor not jumping from a weird port and breaking all of my characters okay like legs and then I lose all my souls I haven't played this before and I don't know game is like enemy placements are like really weird okay so where do where's that spot that we are at when we teleport here from ray lucario
[72:14.09]that's where we need to go and we need to jump from a spot there to get into the manor which is cheating by the way oh I know what you're talking about I am I am with it so where is it I am do we have to actually get we have to get eaten again we may have to get eaten again people keep saying patched but we don't really have very many options do we why did they patch everything fun in this game
[72:44.42]Oh, two-wielding jumping attack?
[72:46.44]Patched.
[72:47.35]Oh, bleed?
[72:48.85]Patched.
[72:49.75]So if it is patched, then can we just not do Rykard?
[72:54.25]And we just have to keep going?
[72:57.45]Ignore them.
[72:57.85]We're going.
[72:58.29]We go again.
[72:59.19]Okay, so we have to go do that Ray Lucario skip again.
[73:04.52]Yeah, sure.
[73:05.18]So we have to go die down there again, which I'm going to lose 22,000 souls, by the way.
[73:08.76]23,000 souls.
[73:09.30]No, I'm not.
[73:17.90]I'm gonna... How much is it to level up?
[73:23.91]Dude, you're a baller.
[73:24.61]That's nothing to you.
[73:25.81]I don't want to lose them.
[73:30.77]Okay, if I have a briefcase full of money, I'm not just gonna, like, open it up and dump it on, like, the fucking side of the road.
[73:36.52]Just because, like, oh, yeah, dude, I'm a baller.
[73:38.12]I don't care.
[73:39.08]Just, like, ban out, like, a million bucks on the fucking road.
[73:42.82]I think they're also saying patches gives you something, but I think that item would be randomized.
[73:47.39]Use a twig.
[73:50.87]Oh, I do have those.
[73:51.69]That's a good idea.
[73:56.71]Where are those things?
[73:58.83]Oh, it's a talisman, right?
[74:05.65]Okay, I'm ready to do whatever you want to do.
[74:07.67]Let's go.
[74:07.97]Are we in combat?
[74:13.23]No.
[74:13.39]It says I'm in combat.
[74:15.99]Oh, it does.
[74:20.95]Well, then we're going.
[74:21.73]Are we going Ray Lucario?
[74:23.10]We have to do that.
[74:32.06]Um and then we go to the schoolhouse classroom.
[74:34.06]This is such- this is such bullshit. Like why didn't they like think to make the game like completely accessible to people that are like breaking it and like using like mods and cheats on it to ruin the whole thing and like randomize everything like they didn't they didn't think about that before they made the game?
[74:48.06]Is that bug where you like block a few times and backstep and teleport across the whole map - is that still in?
[74:54.06]I don't know. There was a speedrun that could beat this game in like two or three minutes, right? Because of that?
[75:03.84]Uh I don't know if it was that fast but they did get pretty-
[75:05.00]It was pretty damn fast. It was like less than five minutes I think eventually.
[75:10.00]No. Yes. No. Yes. No one. I mean if that's still in and we can't jump across a ledge then that's all I'm saying.
[75:19.64]That's all I'm saying.
[75:20.90]I gotta say, somebody, I was watching you play Nioh for a little bit the first time you played it, and I already said this on my stream, but I have to say it because it was on your stream.
[75:29.59]Somebody had an amazing comment on your stream.
[75:33.15]You were trying to learn the game, and you were having trouble, and you were like, oh, the buttons were so hard to remember and just getting used to it.
[75:40.44]and somebody wrote dude don't worry once you get the buttons down you're gonna make it rain on this guy like a boss they said like everything that you had said the other day in one sentence it was like one paragraph it was I like loved it it was like my favorite comment dude don't worry once you learn the buttons you're gonna make it rain on this guy and then like a boss you'll take down the next enemy it was just like perfectly crafted alright that is how it happened
[76:09.67]So we're going back down.
[76:17.10]Shut up.
[76:19.16]Once I learn the buttons of this game, I'm going to do it too.
[76:25.18]You coming?
[76:27.60]Are you?
[76:28.58]I'm coming down right now.
[76:30.16]I'm coming down right now.
[76:31.22]I was killing the hand.
[76:42.35]Just go just going down a lot of ladders and elevators.
[76:46.23]Today.
[76:50.67]OK, so is so does it still work?
[76:52.59]We just die down here, right?
[76:56.13]Yep, just die.
[76:57.45]OK, hey, you're pretty good at that.
[76:59.33]Actually, hold on.
[76:59.85]Let me pick up that item I never got.
[77:08.15]Oh.
[77:10.35]Oh.
[77:12.92]Right here.
[77:14.08]Right here.
[77:14.48]This guy sucks.
[77:29.17]Why is it always like this?
[77:31.01]Yeah, these things murder you if you fight them.
[77:33.25]Yeah, if you actually play the game.
[77:46.42]Minus 26 K. Nope, I put on the talisman.
[77:56.13]OK.
[77:58.27]So.
[78:01.05]There's a place we have to jump from here.
[78:06.07]Like over there.
[78:09.66]I remember.
[78:11.16]I remember you spawning in different location over here.
[78:17.56]I think it's over here.
[78:18.32]Yeah, I think it's this way.
[78:21.12]Can we make this?
[78:26.19]I feel like I... With the horse?
[78:28.45]It's a bit further ahead.
[78:29.51]Oh, no.
[78:31.43]No, no, no, no.
[78:33.67]We're about to just jump off and die.
[78:36.19]I believe I know what they're talking about, but I just remembered you spawning in this area in a different spot.
[78:43.06]In mod chat.
[78:46.45]Wait.
[78:46.69]The mod's playing game form again.
[78:49.75]I mean, they're helping.
[78:54.37]It is over there.
[78:57.74]Yeah, it is that spot.
[78:59.46]And we have to do it from... Oh, man.
[79:03.44]Okay, hold on.
[79:04.60]We gotta do it from, like... Come back over here.
[79:12.42]Where's that from?
[79:13.42]Like, right here?
[79:20.03]this shit out of the way.
[79:21.23]Wait, what?
[79:22.63]It's right here, right?
[79:23.97]Right there?
[79:27.04]It is patched.
[79:27.92]Several people are saying it's patched.
[79:29.22]Wait, that's not it.
[79:30.44]Is that it?
[79:30.84]Yes, it is.
[79:32.28]So it's like right here.
[79:38.24]Fuck.
[79:40.31]My souls!
[79:46.51]That was close.
[79:53.29]oh you respawn here respawn right here I think what about like from here got it patched okay we're good it's that there's a little lip that you have to land on yeah it's tricky there's like a little extra a little bit to the right you're a little extra
[80:25.13]On the top one or the bottom one?
[80:27.37]So, okay, where you are right now, you see where that little, that rock juts out just a little, like a hair extra.
[80:33.24]That's where you want to jump from.
[80:40.48]You're better than me.
[80:41.34]It was, no, it was, I got it in the right spot.
[80:43.48]It's actually really tricky.
[80:44.94]You have to do that thing.
[80:46.88]Like, okay, imagine you're playing Legend of Zelda.
[80:49.31]You know, in Legend of Zelda, it jumped for you at the last possible frame.
[80:52.91]Never played any of them.
[80:55.18]Hold on.
[80:58.72]Okay.
[81:06.54]Closer.
[81:07.32]Closer.
[81:08.12]Yeah, it's that.
[81:08.88]I've got it.
[81:09.26]This next one.
[81:09.92]It's almost you have to step off of the platform a little and get that last hair, that last.
[81:16.25]You got a wind walk on the wind waker.
[81:18.85]There's an Urtria Avatar over here, and it's messing... Okay, be careful.
[81:24.40]I don't want to have to do this again.
[81:25.46]Dude, this is actually really bad.
[81:34.94]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[81:36.20]Is there a bonfire right here?
[81:39.55]Because if I just get the bonfire, can't you just port to it?
[81:42.83]No?
[81:43.27]No, you can't?
[81:53.65]I hit it.
[81:54.91]That was very, very close, but you gotta land on this, like, edge.
[82:00.22]I have to land on the other side.
[82:04.80]Oh, I didn't... I thought I was going in the lava.
[82:07.84]No, no, you have to... What?
[82:09.58]Do you see where I'm standing?
[82:11.78]Okay, no, now that I know that... Wait, you thought you were jumping into the lava?
[82:20.29]What if... Take off your equipment, maybe.
[82:22.84]This is the act.
[82:24.87]I got to tell you, this is not even the hard part.
[82:28.11]Really?
[82:28.59]No, because we have to get by a like one foot hallway where an Ur-Tree avatar is just sitting there and it's like we're going to fall off.
[82:46.77]Maybe they patched it on your game.
[82:48.91]Yeah, because I'm the host.
[82:58.98]oh wait oh wait wait wait wait so like not the lava like where do I land you want to land on the rock where I am okay oh that was it right there I was on it for a second
[83:27.54]Use his controller.
[83:29.38]We can't do that.
[83:30.94]Bro, can you take the controller?
[83:33.78]I can't do that.
[83:34.26]Bro, take it.
[83:34.98]Bro.
[83:35.36]Alright, just PC.
[83:36.96]Okay, I got it.
[83:39.64]Okay, let me... Hold on.
[83:41.87]You're like not even... I wasn't connected.
[83:44.07]I wasn't connected though.
[83:45.25]You didn't even jump at all.
[83:47.13]I wasn't even connected.
[83:47.89]Hold on.
[83:48.65]Can you plug me in?
[83:50.07]Yeah.
[83:50.85]That's Wi-Fi.
[83:51.61]Okay.
[83:52.23]That's the wireless.
[83:53.07]Okay.
[84:03.49]There's something wrong with your controller, man.
[84:05.67]Give it back, give it back.
[84:06.59]Here, just take it back.
[84:07.33]I have a fucking headache now, thanks.
[84:09.85]Your controller, your B button's like sticky.
[84:12.29]I don't know what the fuck you're eating.
[84:13.81]It's like sticky.
[84:14.41]Well, it's different in NEO.
[84:15.35]I have a fucking headache now.
[84:25.44]I fucking hate this!
[84:30.20]We're gonna be here all day.
[84:31.32]VOD viewers?
[84:33.39]You can't skip.
[84:37.62]Yeah, dude, you should disable timeline skipping on this VOD.
[84:42.64]Oh, you have to do it at a 30 FPS.
[84:49.09]Because if you jump in Dark Souls at a high frame rate, it doesn't work.
[84:54.63]Imagine if you could do that.
[84:56.53]That's a real Dark Souls.
[84:57.83]No, no, no.
[84:58.21]I mean, like, make it so people cannot, like, skip through your VOD's timeline.
[85:03.87]No, you have to watch.
[85:05.61]Sorry.
[85:07.49]You have to sit here for this like 20 minutes.
[85:10.26]I got it.
[85:11.84]Are you serious?
[85:12.48]That's very close.
[85:14.00]Do you see where you... Okay.
[85:17.08]On your left, there's a piece that juts out a little bit further.
[85:20.22]You want to land on that like little piece that's jutted out a little further.
[85:23.00]It's like very, very nuanced.
[85:26.33]Yeah, you got to go a little more to the left.
[85:28.45]This one's for all the fucking wolf boys in chat.
[85:32.37]Okay.
[85:32.89]Alright.
[85:35.58]Don't seem to care about them really at all.
[85:38.34]After that.
[85:48.04]This one goes out to all my scaly brethren.
[85:50.73]Okay.
[85:57.27]I missed.
[85:59.43]I'm getting worse.
[86:02.13]Alright, I'm going to stand where you should be.
[86:04.37]I have so many debuffs.
[86:05.95]I'm concerned that even if I make it, I will die because I have like no health.
[86:10.89]Whoa!
[86:11.73]Okay, I don't care.
[86:12.63]Just do it.
[86:13.41]I was going to stand.
[86:14.11]Okay, you need to land like here.
[86:17.68]Okay, I'm aiming.
[86:18.60]Okay, no, stay there.
[86:19.96]No, because you're not going to be able to land on it.
[86:22.12]I think that's it.
[86:33.21]Wow, you guys... He really... This is kind of embarrassing.
[86:37.22]He really must hate those skillies, huh?
[86:39.14]I don't know.
[86:39.46]Yeah, I don't... He's fucking taking a while.
[86:41.84]That's alright.
[86:42.40]I'll be here when you guys are ready.
[86:50.13]Hey, uh... I'm just a big fan of you two.
[86:53.23]Can I get your Switch friend code by any chance?
[86:55.81]Is this your lizard voice?
[86:57.29]Are you mocking lizards?
[86:58.61]Nah, it's all good, man.
[87:00.01]Nah, it's good.
[87:01.88]Keep trying.
[87:04.84]No, me and the Urge Ray Avatar are hanging out and having a conversation.
[87:08.45]Hey, see your way out of it.
[87:15.29]Next one, I have it.
[87:16.49]Next one, I have it 100%.
[87:20.04]I feel like I just connected the dots.
[87:23.70]You want me to come down there and help?
[87:25.92]Could you?
[87:26.82]Maybe you could.
[87:27.88]I'm just kidding.
[87:28.32]I'm going to kill you.
[87:31.88]god damn it guys he's so bored he's doing bits I'm fucking up everything I was sort of like aggro him down here oh you made it alright good luck because now this is the hard part I I actually have so many debuffs I have no health you are guaranteed to die I'm just telling you right now don't be upset I hope you got that down because there's no way you're getting by this
[87:59.70]What did you just do?
[88:01.03]I used a rune arc.
[88:01.81]It didn't do anything.
[88:02.45]Alright, we have to go.
[88:04.45]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[88:05.69]Back up, back up, back up, back up.
[88:06.69]Where are we going?
[88:07.89]Where's the correct path from here?
[88:09.57]We can get on the rooftop to the left.
[88:11.27]I don't, like, where are we going?
[88:12.28]Should we go to the left or up?
[88:17.72]Where's the way to get a bonfire quick?
[88:21.74]Left.
[88:26.53]It's one for all the wolf men out there.
[88:34.02]That's okay.
[88:34.40]You got this jump first try.
[88:35.62]Fuck.
[88:43.54]There were just like bugs in my clothing.
[88:47.39]That's fine.
[88:48.11]There were so many bugs.
[88:52.63]Fucking god damn it.
[88:54.23]Now we're gonna sit here for like another 10 minutes while I do this.
[88:57.53]I did it first try.
[89:01.55]dude my stamina bar is like the size of my it's right here it's like right there I have to get it in less and I have to get in less than five tries so I can prove that I am better than you at this okay there there was no doubt about it but I think also you left your souls
[89:29.99]I'm so angry at you.
[89:30.94]This is your fault.
[89:34.54]This is your fault that that happened.
[89:35.90]I did it in three tries.
[89:36.50]I'm better than you.
[89:36.92]Let's go left.
[89:38.04]Okay.
[89:38.94]Well, I'm going to jump off again to prove that I can do it in three.
[89:47.05]Wait, no, don't do that.
[89:48.01]Alright.
[89:49.33]I have no idea what we're doing here, but we need to be careful because they're firing lasers.
[89:53.70]Ah!
[89:56.70]Over here?
[90:00.76]This way?
[90:01.10]Do we jump from here?
[90:02.82]Okay, I guess we're alright.
[90:15.14]Don't die.
[90:18.37]I'm confused.
[90:22.03]We're in.
[90:22.67]We just have to find the right bonfire.
[90:34.28]Wait, mad that I killed the pod?
[90:36.33]Oh, that's alright.
[90:43.61]Oh, there's a dog.
[90:44.59]There's a dog.
[90:46.09]You don't want to get the item over here?
[90:48.57]I jumped across a weird way.
[90:50.41]This dog's prowling on me.
[90:51.77]Oh God.
[90:52.31]He gonna get me.
[90:53.76]No, no, no.
[90:54.80]I'm good.
[90:58.38]I can't lock onto him.
[91:00.14]I'm right here.
[91:00.50]I'm right here.
[91:00.84]Just focus.
[91:03.92]Got him.
[91:09.04]I do no damage because of all my curses.
[91:14.42]Okay.
[91:16.12]We don't go up.
[91:19.06]I thought you did that.
[91:21.72]Oh no.
[91:23.47]Oh no.
[91:24.39]What are you doing?
[91:26.09]What are you doing?
[91:28.40]Shoot a fucking beam at him or something, dude.
[91:30.59]What the hell?
[91:31.93]I don't do any damage.
[91:33.07]I'm out of magic.
[91:34.01]My magic bar is like a centimeter.
[91:36.11]Alright.
[91:37.31]We can't get up there.
[91:38.09]No, not.
[91:42.92]One more.
[91:45.80]It's fucking Craig.
[91:47.57]Alright.
[91:56.72]There's an elevator.
[91:57.54]I'm telling you.
[91:58.50]We want to take an elevator up, apparently.
[92:07.49]I know there's an item over there, but I'm telling you, it's not worth it.
[92:12.05]We need an elevator.
[92:13.61]Elevator is across the lava.
[92:16.37]Like over here?
[92:16.91]Like this way?
[92:21.97]Do we have to go... Where do we go?
[92:28.62]Oh, shit.
[92:30.22]Go on the rooftops.
[92:33.23]I'm dead.
[92:33.99]Oh, no.
[92:36.29]Oh, no.
[92:38.33]Go left, then elevator up.
[92:47.49]The lava just slows you mostly.
[92:48.86]If you have to quickstep, you can make it.
[92:50.36]Walk on the lava, please.
[92:52.02]I can't.
[92:59.77]I don't have enough health if we have to walk across the lava.
[93:03.71]You actually don't.
[93:05.43]I seriously have, like, a centimeter of a health bar.
[93:08.57]So, alright.
[93:09.77]So, you're talking about, like, down here?
[93:12.15]Walk, like, in that way?
[93:13.44]Or walk, like, down this way?
[93:16.76]Down, like, there, you mean, right?
[93:25.10]Left.
[93:29.00]I need to hide here because I'm gonna cast this bullshit.
[93:39.55]Dude, you're going to have no health bar.
[93:41.23]I think we should leave, dude.
[93:44.46]Yeah, but we like, we're so close.
[93:47.30]So what about like, you talking about this way?
[93:49.24]Like over there?
[93:50.46]Well, can you just do it and then get a vote to teleport?
[93:53.80]Like this?
[93:57.72]Yeah, I think you jump in between that area and then you turn, you go right.
[94:05.83]Not.
[94:06.63]Well, we're going for it now.
[94:08.99]Not like this.
[94:10.69]You got a flask.
[94:11.33]I think you can still make it.
[94:19.66]I think you missed it.
[94:20.66]Where, where, where?
[94:21.46]You got to go back around this octagon.
[94:26.08]Into the gap to the right.
[94:28.46]In here?
[94:28.74]To the right?
[94:30.44]Right.
[94:31.50]Now where?
[94:36.94]Oh!
[94:42.76]Now what?
[94:46.78]Alright.
[94:47.06]Oh my god.
[94:47.50]Just don't die.
[94:48.74]Where's the bonfire from here?
[94:49.97]I forget.
[94:50.29]I told you to go the wrong way.
[94:52.51]It's okay.
[94:52.73]That was like a joke.
[95:00.90]Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[95:02.45]Then there's the thing you go up.
[95:05.63]It just says you died.
[95:06.73]Alright, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[95:11.58]Is anyone's cat like looking?
[95:13.54]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[95:14.24]Is that like a cat?
[95:14.92]I don't know.
[95:15.52]You just make weird noises.
[95:17.34]That's not a typical like come here cat noise.
[95:20.93]so I I noticed that my wife Ashley she always talks to her dog exactly the same way as the rest of her family they like you know there's like a dog speak where you like change your tone of voice like oh you know yes so I was like you like exactly like your sister exactly like you all talk to your dog the same way I was like that's kind of weird and she was like of course that's not weird that's just like we're a family
[95:41.70]So then I was like, oh, well, there's like plenty of ways you could talk to your dog.
[95:44.75]And let me give you an example.
[95:46.55]Our dog's name is Mouse.
[95:47.55]And I just got really weird and slowly started hovering down to it going, hey, Mouse, cute dog.
[95:54.81]And she got so fucking scared and like was panicking to get away from me.
[96:00.49]What the fuck?
[96:03.43]Yeah, I... I do.
[96:06.06]We said, I do.
[96:08.76]Apparently you need the fucking...
[96:11.20]like psycho you need the like like anime or whatever voice yeah how's that anime voice like a few pitches higher I would say that's more muppets than anime that's more like Sesame Street than anime do you like sesame seeds yeah
[96:40.15]Why?
[96:40.33]They don't have any flavor and they get stuck in your teeth.
[96:43.21]The bridge is up.
[96:44.21]So that is complete.
[96:45.81]Now we just go this way and I think we can open up this back door here, right?
[97:00.06]And then this is here.
[97:02.60]It doesn't open from this side.
[97:05.18]It's... Okay.
[97:11.21]This whole thing was for nothing.
[97:15.45]We have to beat this boss in here.
[97:22.99]Find a different bonfire.
[97:24.55]Okay.
[97:26.63]Alright, please pray to the randomizer gods that you just keep dying.
[97:32.97]That in here is like Mad Soldier 2.
[97:35.63]I'm almost there.
[97:39.11]Can I like peek in here and see who it is?
[97:41.23]Oh, is that the boss?
[97:42.33]Oh yeah, and they would glitch that door.
[97:44.90]Bro, it's Mad Soldier!
[97:46.10]I think it's Mad Soldier 2!
[97:48.90]This is huge!
[97:49.66]I think that's just a shitty enemy, isn't it?
[97:54.60]I think that's Mad Soldier 2, I think.
[97:57.86]Wait a minute, no it's not.
[98:02.25]Who is that?
[98:03.01]Do I have binoculars?
[98:05.51]Just fight him, dude!
[98:06.61]No, I don't wanna die!
[98:08.67]Gotta do it eventually.
[98:12.18]Everybody dies once.
[98:14.12]Is it Blade?
[98:20.38]From Mortal Kombat?
[98:23.07]Um, alright.
[98:24.23]So, but I think there's a... Just go, go, go.
[98:28.97]Is it Gideon?
[98:29.99]I'm just going.
[98:32.49]Who is it?
[98:36.36]It's Blade, I think.
[98:40.62]It's Millenia.
[98:41.76]It runs over.
[98:42.26]Dude, the run's over.
[98:44.10]The run's over.
[98:45.14]The run's over!
[98:45.78]What the fuck?
[98:46.76]We're not gonna be... It's impossible.
[98:51.86]It's... You gotta be... She's not gonna have a phase two.
[98:55.31]You got it.
[98:55.83]Wait.
[98:56.43]Yes, she is.
[98:56.83]Wait, yeah, she is at half health.
[99:02.99]As long as you're good at the game, you can win.
[99:05.49]I haven't played against Millenia in a long ass time.
[99:08.79]And I have... How many debuffs you got?
[99:10.43]I have a lot.
[99:27.70]Flawless.
[99:36.83]Just watch out for when she swings the sword.
[99:38.40]A lot of people who fought Malenia don't know the sword hurts.
[99:46.66]Sword's where the damage comes from.
[99:47.66]I have like no stamina.
[100:21.08]It was the sword.
[100:22.76]It's the fact that I have fucking like half of my HP and half of my stamina bar and it's Malenia.
[100:30.57]And I hate this motherfucker.
[100:36.55]Yeah, well.
[100:39.37]I can't take one tick of lava damage and I'm back here.
[100:44.25]I'm in hell.
[100:47.20]Okay, so here's the plan.
[100:50.48]I can't believe Millenia.
[100:51.48]I really hope there's no phase two.
[100:52.44]Alright, so here's what we're going to do.
[100:54.76]Follow me.
[100:55.66]Ready?
[100:57.43]I can't take any... Alright, but me raising the bridge... Look, Jerma.
[101:01.09]Jerma, look at this.
[101:06.73]Okay, we have to leave.
[101:08.27]We have to leave.
[101:09.47]We can't stay here.
[101:10.71]We have to leave.
[101:16.05]Does anybody have a solution?
[101:20.35]You can get to it from the rooftops.
[101:24.72]Okay.
[101:25.70]Let's see if I can... Fuck.
[101:32.38]Dude, why?
[101:34.18]Why are we here?
[101:35.96]Just to suffer.
[101:38.05]Should we just go to the Altus Plateau?
[101:41.49]There's so many different things we could do.
[101:43.81]Go through the caves?
[101:44.51]Yes.
[101:46.07]There's a bonfire over there, you bozo.
[101:50.03]I don't remember where all this stuff is.
[101:51.65]There's a Grace in the town.
[101:55.09]I'm gonna save us, okay?
[101:57.19]I promise I'm gonna rescue us.
[102:00.48]You know what?
[102:01.40]You should just sit down at a bonfire.
[102:03.62]I just didn't... Okay, I'm gonna save us.
[102:04.84]I'm gonna save us.
[102:05.80]It's gonna be all up to me.
[102:23.57]your health bar is going to look like mine it's not great already alright nice and watch this the ledge master
[102:55.17]There's a gargoyle following you.
[102:56.95]What?
[102:57.77]Oh, fuck you, guy.
[102:59.37]He... He... That was very impressive.
[103:04.23]Not gonna lie.
[103:07.19]He's still here.
[103:13.35]Okay.
[103:13.81]Alright, alright.
[103:14.21]I'm gonna find us a bonfire.
[103:17.38]Ah!
[103:18.50]Ah!
[103:19.40]Stop.
[103:19.74]Calm down.
[103:28.93]Okay.
[103:30.25]I think there's one in this town somewhere hanging out.
[103:34.63]Like in here.
[103:39.03]You're right up the ladder.
[103:40.27]Okay, hold on.
[103:42.91]Let me just be smart about this.
[103:44.08]Are you watching?
[103:45.88]The best I can.
[103:51.70]I'm so nervous!
[103:57.95]I don't know what that was, but it was big.
[104:03.51]Whatever it was.
[104:04.57]It was huge.
[104:08.71]Where?
[104:09.91]It looks like the great wolf from the classroom, boss.
[104:12.96]Okay.
[104:13.52]Well, this ladder is a ladder somewhere right here somewhere.
[104:15.92]Where's the ladder?
[104:16.46]I don't see it.
[104:16.94]I'm looking for a ladder.
[104:20.12]Fuck.
[104:21.24]Where's this ladder?
[104:22.78]Help me.
[104:23.12]Somebody help.
[104:29.10]Where?
[104:29.28]It's right there.
[104:29.86]I don't know.
[104:30.67]I don't know where it is.
[104:33.25]Dude, I... Where is this ladder?
[104:37.01]Where is this fucking ladder?
[104:43.17]It's next to the gunpowder enemy.
[104:44.85]You're just panicking.
[104:45.55]That's a giant dog.
[104:46.87]I got us.
[104:50.17]I got us.
[104:50.41]Don't worry.
[104:50.65]I'm going to rescue us.
[104:51.33]Just relax.
[104:57.32]Alright.
[104:58.46]Where is this fucking ladder?
[105:00.34]I am so mad at this game.
[105:02.56]I'm so mad at this game.
[105:04.02]I hate this game.
[105:11.29]Don't you fucking kidding me?
[105:18.93]Yo, Nioh 2 has a co-op.
[105:25.77]Why is that dog down there?
[105:28.59]It's not fair.
[105:32.61]What were the developers thinking putting that there?
[105:39.82]What, a dog in the lava?
[105:49.25]Dude, I actually don't have health.
[105:52.03]If I... Alright.
[105:53.69]It's one tick now.
[105:54.76]I'm getting some conflicted info.
[105:56.40]That even if I use the ladder, the door is locked that I'm going to get to.
[105:59.44]Is that correct?
[106:00.46]Am I being trolled right now by 600 million people?
[106:08.32]I pressed it, but I... That is correct.
[106:10.72]Okay.
[106:11.72]I don't think we can physically do this area.
[106:15.10]Unless we kill Millenia.
[106:17.54]I believe that's true.
[106:22.01]Because I know even speedruns would kill that boss and they want to not fight that boss.
[106:28.33]So if there were a way around it, they'd probably do it.
[106:32.15]Okay, this time I'm going to wait for you to do this bullshit.
[106:35.71]I don't know what they do nowadays.
[106:37.57]Can we even warp out and just get some hit points?
[106:42.59]I'm going to try this one more shot here.
[106:44.67]I was so excited to play Elden Ring today.
[106:48.48]We're okay.
[106:50.54]I'm taking so much more damage per tick.
[107:04.13]Okay.
[107:05.55]So before I run in here, there's a ladder on the right.
[107:09.39]You don't even.
[107:10.65]Fuck you.
[107:11.55]You came over here because you knew I was going to be here.
[107:13.51]Now you're sitting there looking at me.
[107:15.19]That's bullshit and you know it.
[107:21.60]It's up the road.
[107:28.25]I am.
[107:30.09]Up the road.
[107:30.69]The NPC.
[107:31.59]Look at the clip.
[107:33.19]That doesn't do anything.
[107:34.19]It just waits for the protagonist to come back to like initiate a new conversation.
[107:38.51]It's okay.
[107:38.87]Hold on.
[107:40.49]Yeah, it's okay.
[107:40.87]Looks like the great wolf.
[107:42.58]Okay.
[107:42.94]Yeah, I see it.
[107:43.94]But okay.
[107:44.62]Hold on.
[107:44.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[107:48.28]It's behind the big gargoyle thing.
[107:50.96]Okay.
[107:59.61]I know where it is now.
[108:00.71]But can I even get there without getting attacked?
[108:02.53]Uh-oh.
[108:10.01]My god.
[108:26.27]AHH!
[108:27.07]PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!
[108:28.97]AHH!
[108:30.17]Fuck!
[108:37.46]Dude, this is kinda fucking impossible.
[108:40.64]When that dog is here, and there's so much shit.
[108:44.82]Okay.
[108:46.04]Okay.
[108:47.94]Uh, I banished you, which clears the debuffs.
[108:51.60]Oh, that's smart.
[108:52.94]So we can like, I don't know if you want to, we can try on our own.
[108:56.32]If one of us gets to the Malenia, we can fight Malenia.
[108:59.66]Oh, that's actually, wait, what did I just get ported to?
[109:01.82]Why am I here?
[109:06.54]What the fuck's this?
[109:14.87]We have to get killed at the Lucaria gate again.
[109:20.35]Oh, you do.
[109:21.25]I first tried the jump.
[109:22.23]I'm going.
[109:24.71]Alright, well, let's see if you can get there.
[109:26.13]In the meantime, I'm going to relax.
[109:35.50]I hear that there's a dog.
[109:39.28]There is, and it's awful.
[109:49.90]You don't need to.
[109:50.34]You can just go to the place.
[109:52.86]We cannot get the key.
[109:54.88]None of the doors open.
[109:57.26]This entire zone is closed off.
[109:59.82]I think we have to kill Malenia.
[110:03.37]One of us does.
[110:08.95]You can skip Malenia, but it's hard.
[110:13.51]Your drink sounds like a Minecraft skeleton.
[110:25.56]Go through Volcano Manor normally.
[110:29.10]That's not possible.
[110:34.25]I don't know where I am.
[110:52.54]Up the ladder, you can jump to the right onto a ledge and then open the door from the inside.
[110:56.82]Hmm.
[111:05.41]Okay, let me see if I can do this.
[111:11.62]I am... I'm cooking?
[111:16.95]I'm cooking!
[111:17.45]I'm cooking!
[111:17.79]Did you get up the ladder?
[111:19.05]I found... I went all the way around.
[111:20.37]I bloodhound stepped, so I just dashed through the lava.
[111:22.47]Like, way, way, way to the back, and I found one of the elevators.
[111:25.20]Okay.
[111:25.40]Do you have a bonfire?
[111:28.22]I got hit out of the elevator by the one enemy that's in this area.
[111:32.04]So, you didn't make it?
[111:33.92]I'm currently in the process of making it.
[111:36.24]Okay.
[111:37.30]Well, just... You focus.
[111:38.43]Don't even talk to me.
[111:39.03]Just do it.
[111:54.31]I made it.
[111:55.37]I know where I am.
[111:56.71]Okay, so you made it up the ladder.
[111:58.35]And you made it up to the place where we need to be.
[112:01.99]Yes!
[112:02.89]Join me!
[112:04.27]I don't appreciate you making fun of me.
[112:10.46]Say less.
[112:11.14]Oh, it gave me all the debuffs again once I opened up my world.
[112:14.72]It did?
[112:15.08]It did.
[112:16.08]So maybe I should close it.
[112:17.38]Oh, wait a minute.
[112:18.22]Hold on.
[112:21.38]I'm just going to try and find a bonfire.
[112:23.39]Find a bonfire.
[112:24.31]That's the most important thing.
[112:28.82]All these motherfuckers just waiting for me.
[112:30.82]Whatever.
[112:31.16]I was gonna wait for you to do it.
[112:47.62]And then I go up this elevator.
[112:53.89]the dog is just like wait you're not gonna you just lose the dog is gonna kill you I I went a different way I skipped the dog I did dog skip oh you did dog really I'm at the gate to Malenia okay so just be on the lookout for a bonfire and just sit on it when you get there can you still do the bridge jump
[113:28.20]they said you can but it's really really hard bridge jump is hard I remember when they patched it and then I also remember people still doing it the same day but it did look very hard
[113:43.48]How did you do dog skip?
[113:45.12]You didn't climb up the ladder?
[113:46.00]I went all the way to the left through the lava.
[113:49.07]I bloodhound stepped through all the lava and didn't go through the town.
[113:55.69]I'm just going to kill all these motherfuckers.
[113:57.11]I'm just going to kill the dog.
[114:01.34]Come fight me over here.
[114:23.79]Fuck.
[114:26.23]Do I hear a bonfire?
[114:28.15]What is shooting me through the fucking wall, dude?
[114:46.42]That was so stupid!
[114:47.48]Why did I do that?
[114:52.00]This is the worst place to fight this fucking boss.
[114:56.06]This is such a shitty place to do this.
[114:59.43]He's like,
[115:03.76]He's just fucked up.
[115:09.53]Oh no, that's the bug.
[115:10.61]Why did I jump down?
[115:11.63]I don't know.
[115:12.23]I was just too lazy.
[115:14.51]I'm so done with this area.
[115:16.19]I'm just waiting to skip over where Ster is.
[115:29.36]The dog enemy does that thing where they jump in the air and they just like leap across the whole game.
[115:34.27]And he's just doing that in random spots where there's like no way to go.
[115:43.51]I'm killing this dog.
[115:49.14]I'm killing this dog right now.
[115:57.47]I'm clearing this entire zone, and then me and this stupid ass dog are going to have a fight.
[116:01.95]I think I'm near a grave, but I can't remember exactly where it is.
[116:07.20]I'm scared.
[116:07.80]I'm stuck now.
[116:10.44]I think it's like in here to the left.
[116:16.42]Somebody shoot me from arrows across the whole game.
[116:18.70]It's almost like this is completely random.
[116:22.40]Who would have thought?
[116:29.23]If I could just equip my ninjutsu and I'd run fast.
[116:32.04]Alright.
[116:36.58]Fuck this.
[116:40.74]What the fuck?
[116:44.44]Albinauric throwing fucking Krillin's destructo disk.
[116:51.45]Yo, I know there's one down here.
[116:53.51]I'm so glad you're as upset as I am.
[116:56.71]I'm just so lost.
[116:58.51]I feel like I've walked past like three bonfires.
[117:04.61]Get up here.
[117:07.61]I'm not fucking around right now.
[117:09.01]Get up here.
[117:26.38]I did it.
[117:26.86]I got a great.
[117:27.72]I did it.
[117:28.40]I did it.
[117:30.22]No.
[117:33.22]Great.
[117:36.22]OK, I'm opening my world to you.
[117:58.44]It is super incredibly super laggy here because there's another bird with her head in the ceiling.
[118:03.44]And I just imagine all the birds are girls.
[118:04.94]I don't know if that's like a problem.
[118:06.56]I don't know if like that's something I need to take back.
[118:09.99]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[118:18.33]Jerma.
[118:20.35]Jerma.
[118:22.60]You just got exercised.
[118:25.06]Jerma.
[118:28.25]I am joining your world right now okay I'm concerned because there's been a couple times in recent history where you like don't hear anything I say alright here I am what's up oh thank goodness you have no idea what's up guys welcome back from Elden Ring gameplay me and that dog down there I've got a bone to pick with that dog I'm just saying I I we need to go kill that dog at some point
[118:53.08]I think I opened the shortcut to the dog to our right.
[118:55.68]Oh, this is so bad.
[118:56.88]Yeah, something's here.
[118:58.14]Right to our left, there's that bird has its head in the ceiling.
[119:16.45]Okay, please go away.
[119:17.69]Alright.
[119:20.66]So...
[119:22.57]Alright.
[119:23.67]That was fun.
[119:29.59]Oh, dude, he three-fingered of the frenzied flag to you.
[119:32.85]Did you see that?
[119:34.07]That's really cool that you would take my joke.
[119:36.37]Yep.
[119:40.43]Yeah, I think if you really want to kill the dog, it's the shortcut door.
[119:44.03]What they were saying is to climb the ladder, but this door was closed.
[119:46.65]This is the ladder.
[119:47.43]So this is the ladder, and this was locked.
[119:49.88]Yeah, dogs down there.
[119:50.98]So I was doing that for pretty much no reason.
[119:52.42]I would have had to go around the whole thing.
[119:53.82]Oh, man.
[119:55.04]No.
[119:55.28]Then you come in here.
[119:56.42]Do you want to fight the dog?
[119:57.79]Do you not care?
[119:58.77]Do you like killing dogs?
[120:03.59]I'm going to give the dog a name.
[120:05.03]That's Ralphie.
[120:07.03]Oh, that's cool.
[120:07.75]No, I like Ralphie.
[120:10.15]Alright, let's go.
[120:10.67]Yeah, Ralphie just like he was protecting his area.
[120:13.01]But now that like he knows you, he like warmed up to you.
[120:16.19]It's left this way.
[120:17.33]Other way.
[120:19.55]Oh, that's a cool dog.
[120:27.85]Is Ralphie talk like this?
[120:30.83]Yes, I love that character now.
[120:32.65]I don't even I have no problem with that character at all.
[120:41.44]Now this guy's name is Craig and he's a fucking tax auditor.
[120:51.02]Wait, who?
[120:51.36]The one you're fighting right now?
[120:53.84]No, the guy you just killed.
[120:55.68]Oh.
[120:59.53]Guy I killed is Krillin Wannabe.
[121:02.03]Krillin?
[121:03.53]Yeah, from Dragon Ball Z. No, this is Barf Drinker.
[121:09.53]He was throwing the light discs.
[121:12.77]I've never seen an Elbernerk do it.
[121:14.12]I don't know why he was doing it.
[121:22.60]OK, so.
[121:35.23]This character's name is.
[121:38.63]Where did you go up the stairs?
[121:40.89]OK.
[121:42.93]This character, this is... This is Globlob and Snaily.
[121:48.20]And they're best friends.
[121:50.08]And they... What are you doing?
[121:53.67]What are you doing?
[121:59.59]Come up with a better backstory.
[122:22.71]Not cool.
[122:24.95]Wouldn't it be really epic?
[122:27.19]No, I thought this guy was a statue.
[122:32.33]What would be epic?
[122:33.71]If I could take my hat off and use it like a shield.
[122:35.65]That would be pretty cool.
[122:44.23]Oh, I got lightning ram.
[122:50.61]Careful.
[122:58.88]Careful, I ran this whole way.
[123:01.34]You did.
[123:04.82]You need a better backstory for that hat Ster.
[123:07.03]Yeah.
[123:08.03]I don't know why this is a fog gate.
[123:10.57]Because it's one of those keys.
[123:14.73]Oh, the kiss me keys.
[123:23.11]Wait, why can I not attack?
[123:34.40]What a coherent array of enemies.
[123:40.06]Oh my God.
[123:40.86]I'm going to fucking die.
[123:41.98]Guy has like a super sword.
[123:45.64]You just hear a car horn.
[123:49.66]I think it was somebody blowing a horn up here.
[123:51.06]Oh, I thought like I heard like a truck on the highway.
[124:05.25]Okay, so there is an item in here, but I don't know if it was worth using a key, but none of these gargoyles are worth using keys on because I got the painting.
[124:17.65]I got the dragon scale blade.
[124:20.30]That sounds pretty cool.
[124:22.10]Yeah, I don't remember that item.
[124:29.48]Okay.
[124:30.68]Okay.
[124:33.71]So, uh, Malenia, I guess, is the plan.
[124:39.55]I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
[124:45.16]Now, rot.
[124:57.11]That's not good.
[124:59.69]I just kind of came... He looked like he came out of the actual stone from the wall.
[125:06.32]not doing anything he's got a lot of health I don't it's not worth it for the thin beast bones we're gonna get for killing this guy coward okay I actually I I don't I don't like this I'm dead there was a wizard behind me I don't know where he came from because we cleared everything but I turned around and there was a wizard
[125:35.77]It doesn't have that much health, but... I don't think it's worth it.
[125:41.85]But here I am, nonetheless.
[125:44.73]Oh, it's this one.
[125:45.89]Oh, never mind.
[125:46.53]I don't want to fight this fucking thing.
[125:48.67]This is the other... This is the second one.
[125:50.54]The one that has the lightning moves.
[125:53.70]You dying?
[125:54.70]Uh-huh.
[125:56.42]Don't die.
[125:58.56]Just don't do it.
[125:59.62]Okay.
[125:59.92]Just say no.
[126:00.86]Alright, I'm not going to die.
[126:08.12]Dude, it's... I'm dead.
[126:10.74]I mean, it's kind of not... I don't know.
[126:13.37]Why did we fight him?
[126:14.91]You wanted to fight him so bad.
[126:16.07]Well, I didn't know there was a wizard.
[126:20.33]He is a wizard.
[126:25.12]I'm holding this debuff because I was coming back to help.
[126:33.44]Oh, God damn it.
[126:34.20]The fucking big turkey thing is back and everything lags.
[126:39.72]Yeah, and then you rest it.
[126:41.86]That's real cool.
[126:43.11]You would rest.
[126:45.19]I just... This place sucks.
[126:49.95]Now you're fighting a turkey alone.
[126:52.52]I have to kill this thing.
[126:54.08]Like, I just do, right?
[126:57.90]Yeah.
[127:13.01]Okay, it's dead.
[127:19.33]Alright.
[127:21.49]I have... I don't... I have not burned into my short-term memory where to go at all in this fucking goddamn maze of a place.
[127:28.88]Up the stairs.
[127:31.96]And then you're basically there.
[127:43.28]Being gate kept.
[127:44.04]He's going after Ralphie.
[127:46.36]No, don't say that.
[127:58.47]Alright, let's move.
[128:00.90]Alright, squad up.
[128:01.76]We don't want to get three fingered.
[128:07.43]That went right by my head, dude.
[128:09.21]Please watch where you're casting your spells.
[128:11.35]I didn't mean to press that.
[128:12.41]I don't know what I pressed.
[128:16.95]I just turned to you and looked and all of my eyebrows were gone.
[128:21.24]I just turned and looked.
[128:23.02]Excuse me?
[128:23.54]That was right by my face.
[128:25.78]Oh, shit.
[128:26.26]He's back.
[128:26.70]I forgot.
[128:27.30]Alright, just leave.
[128:27.94]Just leave.
[128:28.34]Don't even fight it.
[128:28.86]Okay.
[128:40.02]okay ow I know it's annoying from downtown I was trying to lose him up and you can't be serious I refuse to die from that I don't know when he's gonna cast this thing and it's like p I can hear it it's like fucking sizzling like bacon in a pan it's like and then it happens
[129:05.50]I don't know if there's a closer rest, but that's Malenia.
[129:09.74]Alright.
[129:10.64]Hopefully it's just a phase one.
[129:13.77]Hopefully it's just a phase, mom.
[129:15.59]If it's just phase one, then we should be alright.
[129:17.79]And you very famously beat Malenia without a problem at all.
[129:21.52]So I'm leaving this up to you.
[129:23.24]You'll be my mimic tier, except worse.
[129:46.12]Magic Missile!
[130:02.63]I'm so slow.
[130:03.53]I still have the debuff.
[130:11.09]Oh, this thing!
[130:14.61]And she saws more!
[130:15.51]I'm dead, dude.
[130:22.17]I forgot she could do that.
[130:30.69]Yeah, I really haven't seen her moveset in a hot minute.
[130:39.86]Dude, if this were Nioh, I would have fucking rolled her.
[130:46.25]I hope.
[130:46.61]If this is phase two, then we're in a lot of trouble.
[130:53.83]It actually might be impossible to dodge it in this room.
[130:58.09]I have a new strategy.
[130:58.88]No.
[131:01.63]Here's the strategy.
[131:04.93]Loading.
[131:09.43]A new strat.
[131:10.13]We get there and we don't have a debuff because I was like, I don't know.
[131:12.94]I had like a move speed debuff.
[131:14.06]So all my rolls were like slowed.
[131:16.14]Go behind the pillar when she winds up.
[131:17.98]Will that actually stop her from attacking us?
[131:21.92]She could get stuck on him, yeah.
[131:23.24]Kill the lag bird.
[131:24.18]Okay.
[131:39.79]There's got to be a closer bonfire.
[131:42.46]It might not be.
[131:43.38]I think lifting up the bridge is the way to do a shortcut here.
[131:50.49]Just do a kite around the pillar?
[131:53.27]Yeah, I was thinking just DPS.
[131:54.19]I was thinking just R1, R1, R1, because she staggers.
[131:59.38]Excuse me?
[132:00.56]Oh, it's fucking Barry!
[132:02.06]He's blocked it.
[132:03.90]Or whatever his name was.
[132:05.10]Barry?
[132:06.22]Clamula.
[132:07.06]I don't know.
[132:09.62]I didn't give them names.
[132:10.55]You killed them before I could.
[132:12.39]Oh, no, no, no.
[132:14.67]It was like... Slimy or something?
[132:19.13]I don't know.
[132:21.81]The elevator cage will get back here faster.
[132:23.35]But we're not going to have to worry about it because we're going to finish it right now.
[132:31.39]Is the strategy seriously just like one try Malenia right now?
[132:37.01]I kind of think it has to be.
[132:38.03]Because last try doesn't count and people think it counts and that's kind of weird.
[132:42.49]But like we had debuffs and it didn't count.
[132:47.33]If there is just a phase one, that would be huge, but I don't think it is.
[132:51.92]Yeah, I've never even seen this boss before.
[132:53.42]What is it?
[132:57.79]What?
[132:59.09]Did that?
[132:59.89]Should we?
[133:00.37]What?
[133:00.57]No way.
[133:02.01]He's coming.
[133:04.07]He's coming!
[133:04.67]Oh my god, he is!
[133:05.81]That was such a horrible feeling.
[133:08.01]He's been that close the whole time and we didn't even... He's right behind you!
[133:14.07]He was that close the whole time and we were just nonchalantly just kind of running.
[133:19.16]Alright.
[133:19.48]Alright, come on.
[133:21.02]Let's do it.
[133:23.57]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[133:28.41]This is faster, apparently.
[133:29.83]And we don't have to worry about that fucking horse guy.
[133:34.03]Is it faster, though?
[133:34.83]Get in here with me.
[133:36.23]Is there a bonfire down there?
[133:37.40]I don't know.
[133:37.98]Is there?
[133:40.46]Get in here.
[133:40.82]Get in.
[133:41.14]Get in.
[133:48.58]Is there?
[133:48.88]I mean, this is down...
[133:55.19]oh yeah oh oh I know what they mean we would go down by the dog and then run up here because we open the shortcut by the ladder and then you run up around this way and you avoid it's still pretty not it's still pretty it's comparable back by the bridge
[134:24.92]Alright, well, let's do it.
[134:27.23]Just win.
[134:28.23]Just win.
[134:29.29]Aren't you big into parries?
[134:33.51]Yeah.
[134:35.13]You want me to parry her?
[134:36.13]No, because I know you're going to start and you're going to be mad because I told you to do it.
[134:39.67]You're going to be like, you told me to parry and I haven't practiced.
[134:58.27]Get these benches out of the way so we can actually... When she goes in the air, just hide behind a pillar.
[135:16.46]We just use the pillars regardless.
[135:18.12]Just hide behind them.
[135:27.17]Why'd you tell me to parry that's what I'm saying that so don't What the fuck You good
[135:50.06]She went for the grab to grab you and she grabbed like the side of my ear and fucking skewered me.
[135:56.93]Fuck.
[136:03.13]I hate this boss so much.
[136:06.12]I think on a good day, I wouldn't be worried.
[136:07.80]It's not a good day.
[136:10.39]I want to block everything she's doing and you're not allowed to block in this game.
[136:13.91]I'm just so paranoid that she's going to do the stupid water dance.
[136:16.45]It's going to one shot us.
[136:17.83]So I'm playing so timidly.
[136:20.69]And then she grabs me by my ear and just picks me up and sticks the sword through my stomach.
[136:34.10]It's only one phase, though.
[136:35.88]Other way.
[136:38.37]Out this way.
[136:41.09]And then we have to go... I forget.
[136:49.62]Boogers just came out of my nose.
[136:52.16]A boogie.
[136:53.16]Boogers just like shot out of my nose because it's like we're picking to go this way deliberately.
[136:57.95]And I don't know why because this is going to be way worse than the other way.
[137:02.16]Oh, well, it's just Ralphie.
[137:03.72]Look at how much worse this is.
[137:05.52]It's just Ralphie.
[137:07.54]I just don't know where to go.
[137:08.91]Why did you go this way?
[137:10.59]Why did you go this weird-ass way?
[137:12.63]Which way are you supposed to go?
[137:16.05]Wait.
[137:17.33]Where do we go?
[137:19.61]I don't know.
[137:20.03]You decided.
[137:20.85]I didn't want to come this way.
[137:21.74]I was like, oh, I don't think we should do this.
[137:25.68]Oh, up this way.
[137:29.52]My dog, he's a nice dog.
[137:30.92]He just doesn't know you.
[137:37.65]Actually, this might be better.
[137:38.67]I don't like the synchronized elevator.
[137:45.22]Yeah, that's going to mess us up at some point, I think.
[137:54.43]Dude, I spent, like, four hours fighting Millenia.
[137:59.16]At least.
[138:00.36]This is, like, a thing I don't ever want to see again.
[138:02.92]I think I actually said after I beat Millenia, seeing the regular game, I was like, yeah, I'm never doing this ever again.
[138:07.74]I would beat the whole area, because, like, that Hallow Tree area is pretty cool.
[138:12.13]But before getting to this Fog Gate, I would just leave on any other playthrough.
[138:17.29]Well, it's not any other playthrough.
[138:20.86]It's the playthrough.
[138:22.06]It was way more than four hours.
[138:23.60]It was like 14?
[138:23.96]No, it was not.
[138:26.85]Yeah, I don't even know what buttons... Good strategy.
[138:44.94]Good strategy.
[138:46.10]Careful.
[138:46.38]Get back.
[138:47.52]She's going to go in the air.
[138:48.10]She's going to go
[138:53.26]Hide behind a pillar.
[139:00.02]Nice.
[139:01.89]Nice.
[139:02.09]Just keep doing... Wait.
[139:05.71]She's going to go up.
[139:06.79]She's up.
[139:07.05]She's up.
[139:11.15]She's going to come for you.
[139:11.98]She doesn't give a shit.
[139:13.42]It kind of works.
[139:13.88]It kind of works.
[139:14.64]You're not doing it again, are you?
[139:22.72]How many fucking times do you do that?
[139:24.88]It works, though.
[139:25.38]It works.
[139:25.74]You just can't get close.
[139:26.48]I just can't even drink out of my fucking flask.
[139:36.57]I hate this boss so much.
[139:37.85]Just delete it from the fucking whole game.
[139:43.71]It works.
[139:44.11]It works.
[139:48.63]I mean, I thought we were gonna fight her.
[139:49.79]You were hiding most of the fight.
[139:51.84]And I survived, but then she did that thing where, oh, have you taken some damage?
[139:58.84]Bro, don't worry.
[139:59.58]I ain't gonna let you do shit.
[140:00.94]I'm just gonna be, like, right behind you the whole time.
[140:03.80]And I'm gonna be swinging, like, every, you know, one, two, three, four.
[140:07.57]One, two, don't, you can't drink in this game.
[140:09.83]No, of course you're fighting Malenia.
[140:11.51]Like, just fuck, just turn around and run around.
[140:13.25]Just run away.
[140:18.00]We have the debuff.
[140:18.82]Did you sit down?
[140:20.48]Do we?
[140:20.82]I think so, right?
[140:21.94]Usually when we both die, we don't get one.
[140:24.78]Oh, okay.
[140:24.98]I don't think we have one.
[140:25.74]No, we don't.
[140:27.92]Fucking one guy.
[140:28.78]I hate Malenia's entire moveset.
[140:37.11]Oh, my God.
[140:37.71]I've already wasted flasks.
[140:40.85]Reset.
[140:46.12]It's a skill issue?
[140:47.38]I don't care.
[140:48.36]I don't care.
[140:48.82]Fuck that boss.
[140:51.30]I despise this boss.
[140:53.40]I hate this boss with a burning passion.
[140:56.39]It's the worst boss they've ever made.
[141:00.03]It's worse than Bed of Chaos.
[141:09.77]Come on, you hit me with that?
[141:25.70]Alright, we're in.
[141:29.83]Worse than Bed of Chaos.
[141:30.75]Dude, you okay?
[141:36.89]We're winning.
[141:37.87]You're going to fight her and we're going to win.
[141:39.59]Me and Bed of Chaos, like, smoke a blunt together and hang out and shit.
[141:42.91]Like, me and Lenya... No, don't call me.
[141:45.05]I don't want to hang out.
[141:47.15]She can call me.
[141:53.95]Okay, let's do this, please.
[141:57.85]Nightmare blunt rotation.
[142:01.58]Bed of Chaos.
[142:04.96]I don't know.
[142:05.36]Whatever.
[142:10.25]Are you going to fight her?
[142:11.92]Dude, I'm waiting for the opportunity.
[142:31.07]Why did you jump?
[142:33.15]That's what I'm on.
[142:35.24]I'm on jump mode.
[142:37.34]I'm on block her attacks and jump to dodge.
[142:40.18]Listen, when she does the dance thing, don't go too close to the pillar.
[142:44.67]It's just enough to like keep her right here.
[142:47.29]I'm stuck, I'm stuck.
[142:48.39]Oh no, oh no, the solution.
[142:51.02]The solution's over.
[142:52.46]Oh no, she was in the right spot.
[142:54.92]Can you play your own game and take your own advice next time?
[142:58.02]Dude, she was, excuse me, what's happening here?
[143:04.24]She, from where she killed you, she kept doing that move across the whole map.
[143:09.48]She did it backwards.
[143:15.47]It doesn't work.
[143:16.51]It does, but it's... You gotta get it right... Her attack has that spot in the middle where it... The circle has to be right in the middle of the pillar.
[143:29.64]I don't think we have to kill this bird if we go the other way.
[143:33.24]Maybe.
[143:33.44]Alright.
[143:39.05]Maybe call me crazy?
[143:40.95]Um...
[143:44.53]Let's just attack her and just don't even let her do any moves.
[143:49.34]Oh.
[143:51.44]Oh.
[143:53.78]Dude, I can't.
[143:54.92]Like, this fucking way sucks such asshole.
[143:58.96]We just jumped down into a rave.
[144:06.66]See, what I was doing, my strategy was to... Only jump attacks, right?
[144:10.10]Yes.
[144:12.24]I was trying to run around the pillars and just wait for you to do something.
[144:16.53]Can you scooch up a little?
[144:17.49]I feel like I'm going to fall.
[144:21.95]Okay.
[144:24.58]Jump attacks only, I'm thinking.
[144:26.36]And just try to get the stagger and then one of us does the attack.
[144:30.42]Let me put on that thing, though.
[144:32.21]Where is it?
[144:32.69]Where is it?
[144:43.03]Okay.
[144:44.29]Try to get the stagger.
[144:52.02]Don't even think about it.
[144:52.60]Just don't even think.
[144:53.42]Just go in.
[144:53.72]Okay.
[145:15.13]Oh my God, dude.
[145:18.66]What the fuck?
[145:30.63]Working.
[145:31.85]It's working.
[145:44.33]Watch out!
[145:47.39]It's mommy time!
[145:51.78]It's working!
[145:56.56]Lagging.
[145:57.62]What?
[145:57.84]Lagging.
[145:58.36]Ooh, don't say that now!
[146:00.12]Lagging.
[146:07.45]Why did I do that?
[146:08.65]What the fuck was I thinking?
[146:10.11]I could have just jumped.
[146:11.37]Why did I do the fire move?
[146:12.69]I wanted to be so flashy for no fucking reason.
[146:15.55]I don't know why you would use the fire move.
[146:18.67]I just figured I had an opportunity.
[146:20.83]You got it.
[146:21.11]You got it.
[146:21.41]You got it.
[146:22.07]You're like that guy that killed Malenia like 30,000 times.
[146:27.13]Let me solo her.
[146:29.17]Just channel that energy.
[146:30.41]You can do it.
[146:41.72]okay we strayed from the plan I needed to run I needed to just go into light stance and start running and get the better dodge we had the strategy and it worked I have a question we took her down to half health with jump attacks and she didn't get staggered once what's going on oh you mean like knee like on the knee stagger just like how come we can't get it oh yeah and you have to parry her three times to get like an actual battery
[147:11.72]Oh, yeah.
[147:13.86]Fuck that.
[147:19.38]I love going this way.
[147:22.17]You actually do.
[147:23.57]It's annoying.
[147:28.77]I like running, nothing attacking me, and just watching your health bar.
[147:37.34]It actually works out sometimes, though.
[147:44.63]glad you expected me to be right behind you I looked behind me without even turning my head okay I am Malenia killer blade of michela killer okay let's just go I kill her to do it when she goes up in the air we are full sprinting to the other side of the coliseum
[148:24.23]Watch that stamina burn.
[148:26.21]Yeah, keep hold.
[148:36.01]Cheat, cheat it.
[148:36.55]That was cheating.
[148:48.68]whatever happened to running across the game I mean we were both in the middle of attacks it's fine I've seen you do this once I I never saw it actually
[149:16.17]Just watch out for the sword.
[149:23.52]Brilliant.
[149:24.36]Brilliant.
[150:13.41]You did it twice in a fucking row!
[150:15.11]That move is such horseshit!
[150:16.71]Twice in a row!
[150:17.83]Two times in a row!
[150:18.81]Two!
[150:18.91]Two!
[150:21.38]We have it I I feel like um, you know before when I called the jump before I made the jump I feel it in my soul This is the one You know what I'm saying that was bullshit No, I don't even talk about it.
[150:35.17]We have don't even do that Patience keep hitting her, you know, she when she's gonna go up we just run I got distracted because she got she went down on her knees and she was like, please please kill me and like ah
[150:50.91]I couldn't say no.
[150:53.03]But now I know better.
[150:54.31]She didn't do that move twice in a row.
[150:56.51]I beat her.
[150:59.85]I was in the zone.
[151:00.45]It's because we missed the stab.
[151:04.76]I thought you were going to get the stab and then she was up too quick.
[151:07.66]Yeah, it was too quick.
[151:09.64]But like this time.
[151:12.93]Get a safe distance before you heal.
[151:14.87]Well, the problem is when she does that move twice in a row, she covers so much ground that you just don't know what move is coming next.
[151:20.70]So you think about what does she have in her arsenal?
[151:23.58]And she just did that move.
[151:24.98]So in your brain, you go, that's not happening a second time.
[151:27.98]She's going to do something else.
[151:29.50]But if it happens twice in a row, it throws off your brain.
[151:32.68]And it's just like, that's not good.
[151:33.88]I wasn't expecting it twice.
[151:37.88]You never expect the same move to happen twice in a row.
[151:39.92]You're always like, oh, I just dodged that.
[151:41.80]So what's the next one?
[151:43.22]Let's go.
[151:43.62]Let's go.
[151:46.54]Jump.
[151:46.96]Jump on her.
[151:49.53]How did I jump all the way around her?
[152:01.13]Good.
[152:01.43]Good.
[152:01.65]Good.
[152:01.81]Be careful, though.
[152:05.31]I don't have enough journey.
[152:06.93]Run.
[152:10.85]She's behind the pillar.
[152:11.83]Keep her there.
[152:12.19]Stop making funny references!
[152:47.50]She's probably gonna go up.
[152:51.62]Staggered!
[152:52.60]Staggered!
[152:56.26]She could end this right now if she goes up, so just be very careful.
[152:59.34]Let's just play like a coward, seriously.
[153:07.77]I knew it!
[153:08.29]I knew she was gonna do it!
[153:13.77]Holy shit.
[153:14.69]You got him.
[153:15.21]You got him.
[153:16.07]Alright.
[153:16.29]Alright.
[153:16.55]Alright.
[153:16.81]Alright.
[153:17.19]Alright.
[153:27.87]We did it.
[153:31.31]What?
[153:32.18]Oh, it's the second phase.
[153:35.58]Oh, no.
[153:40.09]What?
[153:40.61]There's a cutscene.
[153:41.59]How come?
[153:43.12]How come?
[153:43.98]How come?
[153:46.50]Oh, she's up.
[153:59.48]That's gonna happen.
[154:01.78]Yeah, she got me.
[154:11.35]It's fine.
[154:11.81]You can do this as long as she doesn't do I kill you.
[154:15.06]I've got fucking rot in two seconds, dude.
[154:16.84]I already have it.
[154:23.32]Day's over.
[154:24.94]With rot too?
[154:25.90]No, no fucking way.
[154:26.66]This is literally fucking impossible in this room.
[154:31.89]Runs over.
[154:35.57]Runs over.
[154:38.63]Yeah, pause.
[154:39.49]That's the only boss so far that has actually, like, regained health and gone to a phase two.
[154:44.62]Oh, we can use, uh, we can use spirit summons.
[154:48.72]No.
[154:49.42]You want to just, like, ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling and bring up some, like, fucking... You will lose all respect from everyone who ever respected you.
[154:57.02]It's randomizer.
[154:58.14]That doesn't matter.
[154:58.89]I don't know about that.
[155:01.17]Dude, I'm telling you, I think we ding-a-ling two teachers in here and we just fucking destroy her.
[155:08.56]I mean, that's your call if you want a ding-a-ling.
[155:10.91]I love how we spent the last two hours straight trying to get here.
[155:23.91]But we don't even have to do this.
[155:25.49]This is optional.
[155:26.89]Yeah.
[155:32.33]We could probably do it.
[155:33.58]How much do you care?
[155:35.93]go again okay we had we just weren't like mentally prepared for a phase two we actually were not our mental cracked the moment she like teleported into the sky it's very true phase one's easy as long as we like respect the uh you die
[156:04.05]Millenia is horseshit.
[156:05.65]You should just ding-a-ling this.
[156:13.07]You should both use the boys so you get 20 people in the room.
[156:15.67]That'd actually be really funny.
[156:26.00]Fucking Millenia.
[156:27.30]You knew she was going to show up at some point.
[156:30.18]This is a really bad room for her to be in.
[156:34.29]Alright.
[156:35.13]What room would you have liked her to be in?
[156:37.36]Something that has 100% more area to run around in.
[156:41.15]Alright, let's do it.
[157:19.95]Oh my god I just fucking hate this piece of shit so much I fucking hate this boss so much I hate this place I hate this boss
[157:30.72]okay then your call like we can run away we can come back later uh we can get plus 50 swords um we're trying it like this let's go play truth or dare alright let's come on I'm doing it like this I feel like looking at it from a different perspective is a good idea I'm gonna play upside down dog got me dog got me
[158:05.89]Oh, God.
[158:06.68]Alright, this is the last attempt, and we're just going to Alta Splato.
[158:20.24]Okay.
[158:34.68]I was so close to hitting you.
[158:39.25]You're too slow!
[158:42.09]You're host.
[158:44.89]I meant the guy who tried to steer me.
[158:46.61]I'm gonna save my ding-a-lings for phase two.
[158:58.04]Smart.
[159:06.30]oh that's not good she's coming for me I'm dead how are we like we're hitting the same amount and before she was staggering so I'm kind of like expecting the stagger before she goes sicko mode and we're not getting it I need you to there's no way I can do this alone although okay kill it kill yourself unless you feel the vibe literally I need one more
[159:32.74]okay I need one more I need it this is the last one no matter what as long as we're careful when she's at the the doomsday threshold
[159:53.68]What am I sipping?
[159:55.04]This is a green tea drink powder.
[159:59.22]I like it a lot.
[160:01.52]It's yummy.
[160:02.10]It's got a little bit of caffeine to give you a little bit.
[160:06.61]It's tasty.
[160:08.07]It's good.
[160:15.97]I read that the green tea, the powder comes from like they grind up goblins.
[160:25.32]I'm gonna fucking die to this.
[160:27.28]I'm fucking gonna die.
[160:28.26]They grind up goblins.
[160:39.39]I don't think that's how it happened.
[160:42.09]I think it's... Hold on, what is it?
[160:47.91]It's a tea leaf.
[160:50.88]They grind that up.
[160:52.86]Have you ever seen someone do it?
[160:54.88]Yeah, actually.
[160:55.92]Like the actual leaf?
[161:00.29]Yes, I've seen it.
[161:02.33]Okay.
[161:07.49]Okay.
[161:07.73]First person to get hit by Malenia owes the other person 20 bucks.
[161:11.25]Why do you just keep trying to financially ruin me?
[161:15.59]I'm just saying.
[161:18.23]Well, that's going to make you play like a little baby boy.
[161:20.33]We got to get fucking in there.
[161:22.50]Get her.
[161:30.24]I'm trying to lighten the mood, man.
[161:32.04]The mood is light.
[161:33.78]Light her up.
[161:41.75]That was a lot of damage.
[161:42.67]I'm expecting it.
[161:44.91]Yep.
[161:48.97]She snuck around.
[161:49.65]It's okay.
[161:52.18]Sorry.
[161:52.48]She snuck around it.
[162:01.58]Don't go up again.
[162:02.14]I feel like she's going up again.
[162:02.93]I can see it in her eyes.
[162:07.95]You're just paranoid.
[162:10.17]Oh my god.
[162:11.07]You're making me scared and I don't think she's going to do it again.
[162:20.61]Just do single hits right now.
[162:21.91]Like single jumps and back up.
[162:25.55]Until she shows her true side.
[162:28.38]Her fucking sicko mode.
[162:30.44]Red haired.
[162:33.70]Is she doing it?
[162:34.52]Nope.
[162:35.34]She's probably about to.
[162:40.84]Every time I jump in, she jumps away.
[162:43.93]If it's happening, it's going to happen very soon.
[162:47.71]Can't see where she's going.
[162:50.59]This is between two pillars.
[163:01.28]Always keep a pillar between you and her.
[163:09.04]Here comes.
[163:12.06]I knew the moment I jumped on her that she was going to do it.
[163:14.90]And I immediately started running and it was still too slow.
[163:18.02]Hey, let me cook for a minute.
[163:19.88]Okay.
[163:44.36]I thought it was over.
[163:46.02]I thought the combo was over.
[163:51.67]My problem with Malenia is just knowing when... You're just so scared of one of her moves that it's almost like a combo will happen and you'll go, don't fucking do it.
[164:01.33]She's going to do the water dance thing.
[164:02.21]Everyone just freak out.
[164:03.49]And then it doesn't happen, but then it does.
[164:05.05]Okay.
[164:15.15]undercooked learn to dodge that move I know that there's technically like a two frame window to go like but guess what I don't know it and it's gonna take a a million years to figure to get that correct you're supposed to dodge through it but there's a window you can dodge through it but if you want to dodge through it you better have it right because you're going to die if you miss even one frame
[164:40.68]but chatter how do we learn how do we learn it do we do we fight the boss to learn that no we have to go there's a training mode where you can just select any boss and oh so we should close the game and open up the training mode it's Elden Ring uh training area okay so we shouldn't fight the boss to learn it tower shield is good I think you can inhale it pretty much right
[165:14.36]I think the... And people were saying the same thing when I played the game for real and fought Millenia.
[165:21.32]And it's... You can dodge through.
[165:23.32]But the thing about dodging through it is you'll dodge through it and then you don't know where she is.
[165:26.76]She's behind you somewhere.
[165:27.90]And it's like you have like one second to really figure out exactly how to dodge through that second and third attack because she goes away from your screen.
[165:36.72]So it's tricky.
[165:37.57]It's hard.
[165:39.95]It's very tricky.
[165:46.56]oh come on really that was really early and I was really hoping we'd get the stagger so I used all my stamina you want me to put anything in the oven here alright probably not and that's too too to it too too immediate
[166:15.08]Alright, like, I don't even care if I lose, so maybe that means I'll win.
[166:22.56]He has nothing left to lose.
[166:24.03]I don't even, like, give a shit.
[166:24.97]Like, who cares if I lose right now?
[166:26.15]Yeah, I don't care.
[166:29.23]Can you please do the Neelix voice?
[166:35.35]I have the most scrumptious cake.
[166:37.21]Oh, Captain.
[166:38.15]Captain.
[166:38.95]Do you think that we could have some scrumptious cake?
[166:41.86]There you go.
[166:48.97]Alright, three, two, one.
[166:50.15]Are we leaving the area?
[166:52.75]One more.
[166:57.15]I have the strap.
[166:59.83]You have a new strap.
[167:00.59]What is it?
[167:01.37]I have the new strap.
[167:02.15]Let's go.
[167:04.19]Can you tell me what the new strap is?
[167:05.64]You just keep doing what you're doing and stop doubting.
[167:08.32]Alright, but what is your... Fill me in on what the strategy is so I can make sure I know what to do.
[167:13.70]No.
[167:16.82]As long as you do your best.
[167:19.77]Honey, we're going to do just fine.
[167:21.87]Okay.
[167:24.87]No help.
[167:28.55]Just do your best.
[167:29.63]But you are approaching this differently, is what you're saying?
[167:32.77]A little bit.
[167:34.79]Okay, if there's a point in, like, phase two when there's three hits left, and you're like, you need to do this, do this, do this, and you didn't tell me what it was.
[167:41.35]No, you just need to do your best.
[167:44.27]I need you to focus.
[167:45.29]I need you to think right now.
[167:47.16]If we lose right now... Uh-huh.
[167:49.71]We have to do it again.
[167:50.41]I want you to be like, no, I'm going to be cautious and safe and just kind of like hit her here and there, jump in, make sure she doesn't go up.
[167:57.23]I mean, Ster, I haven't, Ster, I've been, you've been the one, you've been the one dying.
[168:03.91]I've had to wait around.
[168:06.23]Wouldn't it be better if like, oh, she's been waterfowling at me.
[168:09.29]You're just going to say I'm the one dying because she's attacking me.
[168:11.40]You're not hiding behind, you're not using the pillars.
[168:13.54]Jump on her, you fucking shit.
[168:20.50]I really hope this strategy is going to work out for us.
[168:27.40]Are you serious?
[168:30.64]Okay.
[168:32.12]One more.
[168:32.48]How about this?
[168:35.90]I'm going to beat her right now.
[168:40.05]But you're not.
[168:41.69]Wait.
[168:42.71]You're not.
[168:58.47]You're not even using my strategy.
[169:25.39]Too focused to remember the pillar.
[169:27.45]No, I just wasn't in the right spot.
[169:29.55]And even if I ran behind the pillar, she probably would have gone around it.
[169:35.05]Alright, so... This is one for real.
[169:36.63]I just... I didn't... We're going to be stuck here for, like, four hours.
[169:40.13]No, no, no, no, no.
[169:40.71]Wait, wait, wait.
[169:43.07]Ster, you realize that we have, like, good weapons.
[169:46.34]But I... We are, like, potentially...
[169:50.09]Like, ah, like 40 levels to like a 50 levels too low for her.
[169:55.62]You know that, right?
[169:57.56]Yes.
[169:58.42]So I am aware that we shouldn't be insta dying the moment she touches us because we should just have like more health and stuff.
[170:05.56]It scales.
[170:06.06]No, let us have this.
[170:09.77]It scaled.
[170:10.21]It scaled.
[170:10.55]No, no, no.
[170:11.79]Let us have this.
[170:14.55]How come the streamers can be fallible, but the mod can't be?
[170:17.33]And then the scaling can't be a little off for Malenia.
[170:20.33]Copium Overdose.
[170:21.57]They messed up the code on Malenia.
[170:23.59]She's not scaled.
[170:26.25]Oh, I did hear about that.
[170:27.75]Yeah.
[170:28.41]It's in the patch notes.
[170:29.91]Yeah, it was like patch notes like 1.2.3b.
[170:32.13]It was like having tons of trouble with Malenia.
[170:38.93]It seems to be she's doubling her levels and the scaling doesn't work and she's doubling levels, not scaling down.
[170:43.93]So it's like... Yeah.
[170:45.71]I mean, if we beat this, it's pretty good.
[170:47.97]And it's a little bit harder without the Great Rune.
[170:51.69]Actually true, though.
[170:54.96]That's the only thing that, like, the Copium Overload is, like, that's what you're saying is actually kind of true.
[171:06.74]This isn't a bad start.
[171:07.75]It's alright.
[171:08.51]Hold together.
[171:15.73]don't you dare kill me I will scream as loud as I can which is close keep your stamina nope no why did I why even attempt it this opportunity is so small alright yeah be careful it's coming
[171:47.23]Keep a pillar between the two of you.
[171:49.67]I am.
[171:50.47]Here it is.
[171:55.72]Holy shit!
[171:56.76]Are you fucking kidding me?
[171:58.00]You're good.
[171:58.32]You're good.
[171:58.62]Hey, you're fine.
[171:59.14]You're fine.
[171:59.66]It was only a little bit of HP taken off.
[172:01.24]You're fine.
[172:02.30]That was insane!
[172:11.93]Not a bad attempt.
[172:24.92]If you could do it again, just be careful.
[172:26.76]Yeah.
[172:27.62]I'm envisioning it.
[172:28.80]My game... My game, like, stuttered.
[172:32.06]I'm envisioning.
[172:32.76]I'm envisioning.
[172:33.40]Did he block onto that?
[172:47.81]Okay, get ready for sicko mode.
[172:49.02]So, get out of the rot.
[172:54.24]Oh, it hit us both.
[172:55.50]It hit us both.
[172:56.14]Did it kill us both?
[172:56.92]It killed me.
[172:57.46]It scarlet rotted me.
[172:59.44]Oh.
[173:08.67]I was just wedged up against the fucking wall.
[173:10.57]I have no healing.
[173:14.63]Oh, that sucks.
[173:17.87]I thought we were in totally different spots, but then we kind of just ran together.
[173:22.95]It's weirder.
[173:23.41]Cause like she would normally always go to the center of the room, right?
[173:26.31]I know.
[173:28.32]Let's see that.
[173:28.88]Okay.
[173:30.82]Yeah.
[173:31.02]What happened there?
[173:31.62]Because when she did it at first, we were kind of confused and she went right in the middle, but she usually dives on top of you.
[173:37.74]Right.
[173:37.98]I thought in the real fight, she always lands in the center.
[173:41.29]Wait, maybe I'm crazy.
[173:42.83]I think you are right.
[173:46.55]Doesn't it?
[173:46.99]Yeah, she lands in the middle.
[173:47.97]Why did she jump on top of us?
[173:49.35]No, she dives you.
[173:50.37]Oh, yeah, she does.
[173:53.37]Okay.
[173:57.08]Try and get a pillar between her again.
[173:58.56]That's a good idea.
[174:00.92]And just try and roll.
[174:05.76]You fucking hit Ralphie.
[174:07.20]Well, I mean, Ralphie's completely in the way.
[174:11.90]Psycho.
[174:22.75]She dives on you, but after the cutscene goes to the middle.
[174:25.29]Oh.
[174:39.40]alright this let's actually last attempt because you know what's gonna happen we're gonna get to fate we're gonna get to phase three we're gonna get to fit we're gonna get halfway through phase two and she has new moves in phase two that we're both gonna go oh what is it what is that move and it's we're both gonna die to it and then we're gonna put our controllers in the air phase two easy
[175:02.82]No, she does that weird ghost attack thing where she goes in the air and like 10 ghosts come out.
[175:07.06]Yeah.
[175:08.74]In here, that's going to be hell.
[175:10.94]But whatever.
[175:11.56]It's alright.
[175:12.56]Those are excuses.
[175:13.26]Okay.
[175:40.98]Oh, God damn it.
[175:41.82]That's really unfortunate.
[175:44.04]Yeah, it is.
[175:44.62]I don't think we're going to do it.
[175:58.28]When I was first playing this boss, I remember thinking I'm not going to be able to do this and I'm going to have to tell the stream that I'm just not doing it because I don't think I can.
[176:07.93]I really didn't think it was possible for me to do it.
[176:12.92]I was trying to figure out, like, how am I gonna tell everybody that I can't do it and I'm like, I'm just gonna give up?
[176:19.42]That was actually, that was actually going through my mind for the last, like, two hours before I beat her.
[176:25.50]It's like, oh, how do I, like, say, hey guys, like, this is not fucking happening.
[176:28.87]It just isn't.
[176:54.62]Third fucking time.
[176:58.58]Stop doing this move.
[177:00.54]Stop doing this move, please.
[177:06.50]She wants it.
[177:08.40]It's the only move she has.
[177:09.64]Alright.
[177:35.78]I'm just... I hate this boss so much.
[177:43.38]Want to go fight Bed of Chaos?
[177:47.58]I would rather become roommates with The Bed of Chaos for five years than fight this piece of shit five more times.
[178:08.35]That one was really close, though.
[178:13.85]Just summon... We could... Alright, this is the final attempt.
[178:17.37]This is the real last one.
[178:18.89]No more... No more fucking around.
[178:21.62]Before I, like...
[178:27.59]let's go somewhere else we're going out to plateau right now I'm just gonna teleport there without you I'm just gonna go there without you okay alright yeah I I don't know I have a lot of life but every time she dives at me I don't even have a chance to like Dodge the second hit of uh the waterfowl like it just killed me I don't know if because I have like no armor on or what my situation is I'm just a dead boy
[178:54.91]And I'm imagining a scenario where like The Bed of Chaos is like fucking dirty laundry is everywhere in the house and shit.
[179:01.25]And just like pots and pans go uncleaned after he cooks whatever fucked up shit that he cooks.
[179:08.78]Just constant issues, really loud at like two, three, four o'clock in the morning.
[179:14.24]I don't even care.
[179:15.28]That's OK.
[179:16.42]I'm not fighting Malenia again.
[179:24.54]Well, just decide where you want to go.
[179:27.02]OK.
[179:31.77]Where do we want?
[179:32.53]We want to go to the OK.
[179:35.17]If we go.
[179:37.63]Here, right?
[179:38.91]No, no.
[179:40.61]We don't have the lift, do we?
[179:51.08]I'm fighting her right now.
[179:52.10]It's awful.
[179:55.40]One more time?
[179:57.82]No, no more times.
[180:04.62]No, there are no more times.
[180:06.38]Alright, let's... Why am I always in combat here?
[180:09.93]Where's the place to go to Alta's Plateau?
[180:13.87]We can come back.
[180:15.53]Well, what great rune bosses have we not done?
[180:17.57]We were going to do Ricard.
[180:19.47]Ricard is off the table as of right now.
[180:23.88]We did Godfrey.
[180:27.28]then I think we're done can we just like walk this way like here where that kind of burnt Earth tree is that top where the bridge is can we we can get up there right we can go to moog if we go to the uh oh underground city we could do underground that sounds good to me alright hold me back in let's go underground
[180:53.57]uh what teleporter is that uh we have a couple of them but I don't know if that's the right ones we have to go through yeah I remember like the path to get down there when the ground is destroyed is really awkward yeah underground sucks in um
[181:17.66]uh randomizer well I'd rather go back to Malenia when we have like a level 100 and I like all the stuff that we want not like it's gonna help uh I have opened my world to wanderers do we need to just go down to like the co for a riverbank or there's a different way to get down to like actual no you have to go to the just come come to me come come to my world
[181:51.97]Is this a sewer pipe?
[181:54.38]Yeah.
[181:56.16]Where all the omens are?
[181:56.94]Something like that.
[182:04.32]The fuck are you guys running?
[182:12.04]Alright.
[182:14.08]Following you.
[182:27.08]Why did it have to be Millenia?
[182:30.50]It could be any boss, you know?
[182:33.18]That one random room.
[182:36.21]Hey, it could be anything, so that means it could be Millenia.
[182:41.13]I know, but, like, I really wanted to see if, like, we have to use the spear on whoever replaces Rykard.
[182:47.46]I think we could do it eventually.
[182:49.54]We just gotta, like, we just gotta go for it.
[182:57.35]It doesn't.
[182:57.69]I don't know.
[182:59.25]It depends when she's looking at me, but it doesn't feel great to do on a caster.
[183:05.07]Yeah, that's also hard.
[183:06.23]It's a slow.
[183:09.58]If one of us was like a Dex user, I feel like that fights easier.
[183:12.50]Everyone's going to write Omega LOL Dex in chat, but it's alright.
[183:25.15]oh we had to jump down on the other side I think I don't know this I remember like in my first playthrough just walking around this area for like an hour being like huh yeah you gotta go like down
[183:54.91]There are a couple of things to do down here.
[183:55.93]I almost just didn't make that.
[184:08.83]With a double jump.
[184:11.17]I spell.
[184:17.67]It's an ancient city of wonder.
[184:20.43]What could live Malenia?
[184:24.73]Is it possible for duplicates?
[184:26.10]It's not, right?
[184:26.60]I don't think so.
[184:28.00]That's where Millenia is.
[184:29.26]That's where Millenia will stay.
[184:30.40]Okay.
[184:31.64]That's alright then.
[184:32.16]A little bit of a fall joke.
[184:50.35]See, my issue is I'm like rushing.
[184:53.38]I still feel like Millenia is behind us.
[184:57.11]And I'm at the fucking Volcano Manor.
[185:02.63]I could probably just go grab the bonfire and vote.
[185:09.00]Though I remember not getting a bonfire for a while down here.
[185:13.34]I can't really leave because I would port you out.
[185:18.51]Okay.
[185:19.71]Just chill for a second.
[185:20.83]Take a breather.
[185:21.61]Malenia is not behind you.
[185:34.68]Wait a minute.
[185:35.14]She's behind you.
[185:35.66]I don't know why you would believe that.
[185:42.83]Somebody is behind me.
[185:52.80]you're just playing VR in your game guys come come to my stream if you want to see his perspective like of just him in VR and like the actual inside the helmet view is I mean I I can banish you and you can just join me again and then you'd be with me that's probably easier you know I I like items down here I can just I can just do it you keep playing let's get up
[186:31.74]OK.
[186:33.50]I'm going to try to join you again.
[186:35.14]It was I walked off.
[186:49.73]I got Nicholas Needle.
[186:54.61]Looks like I beat her.
[186:57.99]Cool alright so.
[187:02.35]What are the actual bosses that are down here?
[187:04.21]There's another one of those.
[187:06.01]The Mimic.
[187:06.43]Spirits, right?
[187:07.55]And the big Nokron Dragon Man.
[187:11.58]And Moog, if you get really far down, is down here, right?
[187:16.00]I think we need a certain item or something for Moog.
[187:19.98]Moog.
[187:22.70]Moog-like?
[187:23.82]Yeah.
[187:25.32]I don't know if we can actually do Moog.
[187:29.48]There is a Moog-like down here, though.
[187:34.07]Uh, I'm just gonna walk out of this room.
[187:35.45]Okay.
[187:51.74]Good.
[187:55.28]Glintstone stars, do you want it?
[187:59.23]No.
[188:07.84]There's like Christmas nights down here usually.
[188:09.80]There are, but it's randomized, so I doubt we'll see them.
[188:16.04]But yeah, right down this hill is the Mimic Tear.
[188:18.94]I don't know what boss would be in here.
[188:25.27]It's like the first enemies we've killed in like three hours.
[188:31.82]Hey, Malenia is always gonna just make a, like, six-hour gap on any stream where somebody's playing it.
[188:39.87]It's just the way it is.
[188:42.33]You're not gonna even get the item?
[188:51.26]I mean, it looks like a dumb lame item.
[188:54.54]Shattering Crystal.
[188:55.82]Do you want it?
[188:57.24]Somber 8.
[188:57.76]And the Mantis Blade.
[189:00.21]No.
[189:01.96]I think the only spells I really want are like the beam ones.
[189:07.77]It's hurt a lot.
[189:11.83]Well, these guys are empowered by Moog.
[189:13.79]So what am I using?
[189:20.40]I'm using the Magma Wyrm sword.
[189:24.78]I'm using it's called the magma worms scale sword.
[189:35.25]Runak.
[189:39.71]I do wonder what we're going to do about acquiring great runes.
[189:46.35]Didn't you say that there's a thing with this randomizer where, oh, if you want to find this specific item, you can or something?
[189:53.24]Oh, yeah.
[189:53.98]There's like a cheat sheet notepad where you can look up where stuff is.
[189:57.08]And I think also the merchant cell hints.
[190:03.31]You go.
[190:04.29]I'm scared.
[190:05.67]As long as it's not a dragon or a Malenia.
[190:09.73]It's just a misbegotten, so we're good.
[190:20.30]It's a mimic misbegotten.
[190:31.31]Yikes.
[190:41.67]That was so much easier than Malenia.
[190:45.55]Memory stone.
[190:47.65]I am still, I don't know what it is.
[190:49.15]I'm getting golden seeds from every boss.
[190:51.04]That's good.
[191:04.33]Do I have any?
[191:05.77]Not really.
[191:06.19]I feel like it's time for a change of clothing.
[191:17.96]Oh, there's also the deer.
[191:21.99]Yes.
[191:22.63]If we light all of the thingies.
[191:25.81]Which I know, kind of a tired statement, I never did it.
[191:30.60]I did the first deer and then I came down to this area and I was like getting shot by people who had bows.
[191:36.00]Oh, you didn't do this one.
[191:36.74]This one has a different moveset.
[191:37.64]And then I moved on with my life.
[191:48.73]The deer boss is really actually pretty cool.
[191:52.41]I enjoyed fighting the deer bosses.
[191:54.29]I think they were fun.
[192:03.39]Damn, that was a triple item drop.
[192:08.14]I didn't mean to do that.
[192:09.04]I thought it was an enemy.
[192:10.50]Mine was a living jaw.
[192:11.52]Okay.
[192:30.66]So do you want to fight the whatever's here?
[192:33.64]Yeah, light that flame.
[192:36.16]There are six.
[192:36.85]420.
[192:37.07]I think there are six, right?
[192:38.29]420, wait.
[192:40.49]Are you 420?
[192:40.91]You like 420?
[192:41.75]No.
[192:41.81]I'm relating.
[192:43.15]420, alright.
[192:55.04]right 420. now just if you do recreational marijuana and it's legal in your state or wherever you are cool in moderation be careful don't do too much it's not like just it just treat it like anything else that you know any more too much of a good thing too much of anything is bad
[193:20.44]Shut up, Dad.
[193:21.08]No, I'm serious.
[193:22.88]I'm serious.
[193:23.88]Be serious about it.
[193:25.32]They say even too many Oreos.
[193:28.83]Yeah, it's true.
[193:31.77]You just have to touch them, right?
[193:32.77]Doesn't matter.
[193:33.87]Yeah.
[193:43.79]That looks really weird.
[193:46.81]Elden Lord braces.
[193:52.55]Oh wait, isn't there like a mini boss over here too, inside this little area?
[193:58.54]I think it's just an item.
[194:01.68]It's just an item, but it's like, we'll go get it.
[194:07.06]Jar.
[194:07.76]I think it's a, it's a chest.
[194:11.52]If you go up all the way.
[194:13.06]Yeah, it is a chest, but there is an opportunity for something cool to be in the chest.
[194:19.55]I really don't want an opportunity to like jump off this map.
[194:22.22]I don't want to be the one to do that, so I'm going to be careful.
[194:27.40]I am the one that would do that.
[194:34.58]Watch out, it's being guarded.
[194:40.36]By the fucking gruesome slob.
[194:43.70]Death route.
[194:45.72]You really are taking your time.
[194:50.56]controller unplugged his control the vibe was off my controller unplugged look so
[195:20.98]Can you knock it out of here without teleporting?
[195:23.69]You actually might not be able to get out of there.
[195:30.19]Yeah, I don't think you can.
[195:31.05]Do you want to just port?
[195:35.69]Yeah, well, let me turn this one on.
[195:40.57]I can do it too, right?
[195:44.71]Yeah.
[195:44.97]Yeah.
[195:50.30]If you port, I will say yes.
[195:52.46]I already voted.
[195:57.32]You did?
[195:58.25]I'm in combat.
[195:59.31]I mean, let me just get this one.
[196:20.46]Oh, no, you can get out.
[196:21.16]I'm good.
[196:21.88]Are you good?
[196:23.18]Yeah.
[196:24.70]Oh, you did get out.
[196:28.78]We need, what, two more?
[196:30.48]I got one just now.
[196:31.46]I think there is one or two more.
[196:38.25]Does anything happen to let you know you got them all?
[196:42.27]I don't remember.
[196:44.55]Probably.
[196:45.05]I don't think so.
[196:50.99]We need to see.
[196:55.37]We get this one.
[196:55.94]We got that one.
[196:58.66]I think we got them all.
[196:59.44]This is one more somewhere.
[197:05.92]If we get them all.
[197:08.57]Oh God.
[197:10.01]That seriously killed me.
[197:11.63]There is one is one more.
[197:20.60]one remains what's my favorite pasta shape um probably penne or spaghetti I'm getting where this last one is I feel like it's deep
[197:50.84]I got it you got it it's a good thing I died I never would have came back here our gathers oh yeah there we go I have a debuff uh do you want to sit at the bonfire no we're doing this boss hard mode we don't even know what it is what if it's hard it's gonna be super easy boss we've had like a really rough start to the stream just like last time where we decided to like
[198:19.15]run our heads into Placidusax and we ran our heads into Malenia and jumping off a cliff.
[198:25.51]You know what I mean?
[198:26.49]Okay.
[198:27.23]Well, give them a minute to vote.
[198:31.37]Never mind.
[198:31.95]Whoops.
[198:32.81]I goofed it.
[198:33.95]Oh, no, you didn't.
[198:35.69]I still don't have to go in.
[198:38.57]Yeah, let's see.
[198:39.61]Do you think we'll beat this first try?
[198:43.55]This is going to be the putrid clown.
[198:47.47]The
[198:48.46]Clown.
[198:49.20]Future clown juggler.
[198:50.38]Alright.
[199:00.68]It looks like a lot of people think yes.
[199:06.38]A lot of people are saying yes.
[199:09.04]What they don't understand is behind this door is... Hold on.
[199:13.10]If it's like Rodan, the stream is just going to end.
[199:15.20]It might.
[199:15.48]I don't know.
[199:15.94]Alright.
[199:16.88]Let's go.
[199:25.55]Oh, no.
[199:29.17]Well, there's a lot of mini bosses in this game, I gotta say, for us to find, like, all of the endgame bosses.
[199:44.00]Thankfully, it's in an area that makes sense for this fight.
[199:50.75]Where are the beams?
[199:52.21]Don't they come down?
[199:53.79]They should.
[199:54.23]Maybe they hit the ceiling.
[200:05.24]I forget this whole fight.
[200:06.96]Same.
[200:07.96]I haven't gotten next to it yet.
[200:15.04]Oh my goodness.
[200:18.36]Yeah, let's first try easy.
[200:22.89]Hit it.
[200:24.11]And then it's gone.
[200:25.17]Eat shit!
[200:37.96]Oh, that fucking hurts.
[200:39.31]Oh.
[200:49.90]Oh God.
[200:50.48]It's not going well.
[200:53.97]It's not going that badly either though.
[200:56.37]I don't have a lot of class right now.
[201:08.27]I think it's just a game of patience.
[201:15.89]Where am I?
[201:17.67]I used to in triangle mode.
[201:20.64]I think.
[201:21.18]What is it?
[201:21.50]Triangle mode?
[201:22.12]Oh, you have to jump over it, right?
[201:25.50]Oh my god.
[201:26.36]Okay, well.
[201:27.53]I baby?
[201:28.23]I baby.
[201:31.09]No, I said I maybe?
[201:32.27]I don't know.
[201:32.87]I think we're okay, man.
[201:34.73]I think we're just thinking way too deeply here.
[201:42.92]He looked like he was swinging at you.
[201:44.66]He is now.
[201:49.51]I have one flask remaining I I so wish this was an arena where we could use a horse I didn't dodge that I thought I did looked like I did he's just running
[202:26.84]I think we're alright.
[202:27.78]Just play it safe.
[202:36.57]Uh, frames?
[202:47.05]Oh, this fucking move.
[202:50.15]It's on you.
[202:52.01]What the hell?
[202:53.84]Oh, that's this thing!
[202:56.36]Stop yelling.
[202:57.24]What is it?
[202:57.68]Am I making a YouTube video or what?
[203:02.84]It'd be a sick video if you were.
[203:05.45]Uh-oh, he's doing triangle mode.
[203:10.03]Or circle, man.
[203:16.42]Get out!
[203:20.10]Okay, he nuked me.
[203:22.26]Stay alive.
[204:08.72]Wow.
[204:09.40]Believers.
[204:11.22]Hey, congratulations for the fucking millions of points you probably just got.
[204:18.32]I got great rune of the unborn.
[204:19.84]I got a stone sword key and a bell bearing.
[204:24.32]And the glint stone wet blade and a bell bearing.
[204:27.90]Wait, sure.
[204:28.44]I've got a few bell bearings.
[204:29.48]I don't know what's in them.
[204:33.16]We should go check.
[204:42.70]I'll be really honest though we lucked out big time because if you put the Elden Beast in a room that's small like that Malenia room I don't think we probably wouldn't to fight him in a small room no I don't think you know you're not no I would all those moves are so they're just aoe spam moves that we wouldn't you wouldn't be able to do it well I would love to like for the experience to see what that fight's like if you're not constantly running across a football field
[205:12.35]Like, how are they going to let him run that far and not give me a fucking sniper rifle in this game?
[205:36.62]So we did that.
[205:38.08]What else is down here?
[205:39.00]There's the Mohg.
[205:39.58]Then you drop down here and you go to... Oh, where the double gargoyles are.
[205:43.16]Yeah.
[205:43.38]We might get some... That's going to be fun.
[205:46.08]Whatever that is.
[205:53.80]RIP 15k.
[205:54.65]Imagine all the emotes with glasses I could have had with that much money.
[205:57.79]That's so... That was...
[206:05.28]Emotes with glasses.
[206:07.60]I have no channel point shit.
[206:09.65]Like, really at all.
[206:10.59]It's emotes with glasses.
[206:11.87]I mean, there aren't a lot of options.
[206:15.93]Some people have millions of points here, and it's like, oh, it's like a few hundred to put glasses on the jermaMoon emote.
[206:24.16]Nice.
[206:24.50]There's a guy behind you.
[206:35.91]Oh, watch out.
[206:36.37]It's you.
[206:37.15]Oh, it's you.
[206:54.47]Crab.
[206:59.15]Look at all those glasses.
[207:03.09]So many glasses emotes.
[207:08.87]does the Glintstone wet blade even let me do I believe it lets you imbue weapons with the magic damage ash of war stuff oh yeah but you can scale off of intelligence with pretty much any weapon I was I was thinking because I already do that but I'm using Glintstone pebble to do it there's another somber ancient stone I've gotten a lot of bell bearings it really might be worth after we do this to go check what's there
[207:44.03]Oh, there's a legendary over here.
[207:47.11]Legendary, legendary, legendary, legendary.
[207:53.31]Ooh, the Lord of Blood's robe.
[208:01.15]Where is it?
[208:01.71]Oh.
[208:09.10]I got mogs.
[208:11.71]robes I have the twinned armor set for this apparently I gotta I gotta pose okay nice
[208:37.95]who is that uh that is the other that's the twin brother oh this is bad I don't think we need the spear but but also we could be wrong and just die um okay we got the spear we have the spear apparently where is it I hate when this happens where is it I hate when this happens there it is coming slow don't panic
[209:07.74]Alright, I think we can do the technique where he never attacks you.
[209:11.98]We don't have the... Oh, you have the weapon art.
[209:17.24]If you can stun him, you can keep him stunned forever, I think.
[209:19.90]Wait, I am confused.
[209:23.60]What do you mean?
[209:24.32]How do you do this shit again?
[209:25.34]Left trigger.
[209:27.42]Yeah, mine doesn't have a wind blade.
[209:30.51]Only you can do it.
[209:32.23]My chat's saying...
[209:37.60]I saw so many speedruns at this part that I know you can literally just keep him in like a loop if you really wanted to.
[209:42.92]Well, I hope you do because I can't help.
[209:44.24]Does this thing cost mana or no?
[210:04.29]Oh, they patched it.
[210:05.09]Okay.
[210:05.33]That's good to know.
[210:10.96]Oh, did they find like something that was fun and then they like patched it out?
[210:14.54]You need mana to do this shit.
[210:16.10]God damn it.
[210:18.14]I'm helping.
[210:28.89]I'm overweight with this.
[210:35.95]I wish I could see.
[210:36.73]I got him.
[210:56.52]I have no more mana.
[211:10.47]I guess I could just attack like this.
[211:14.81]Please don't die.
[211:15.47]It's only you.
[211:17.72]I'm not going to.
[211:18.20]Who said I was going to die?
[211:19.08]I'm just I'm just worried because I can't help.
[211:23.28]No phase two.
[211:24.06]No phase two.
[211:24.74]No phase two.
[211:26.84]No phase two.
[211:27.72]Don't do it.
[211:36.29]Yeah.
[211:39.23]Nothing can kill a god and together we will eat them all.
[211:45.01]These quotes are approximately correct.
[211:50.24]You told an AI to do the Rykard lines.
[211:52.62]Okay.
[211:55.82]Good fight.
[212:08.66]I have to level up.
[212:12.67]Yeah, so the next Elden, we're going to do Elden Ring 2.
[212:16.61]Dark Souls 4.
[212:18.19]And there's totally going to be like a sword that shoots like wind.
[212:22.62]There's going to be one boss.
[212:25.12]I have a question for you.
[212:26.10]There's going to be a swamp.
[212:27.86]I want the actual Ster take because I don't know if this is just stupid or not, but I was thinking about this.
[212:33.61]Do you, because look, everybody loves the FromSoftware RPGs like this, right?
[212:39.75]We're not talking about any of the other games they've ever made.
[212:41.81]Not like Armored Core, whatever.
[212:43.43]This lower left of your screen that looks like this in like five of their games.
[212:48.64]Everybody loves these with the stamina bar and the, you know, dodging and the parrying.
[212:52.86]They call them souls.
[212:53.96]Sure.
[212:56.01]Yeah.
[212:56.45]Do you think it would be cool?
[213:00.05]They kind of just... And look, I'm not complaining.
[213:02.75]I love these games.
[213:03.69]They're amazing.
[213:05.38]But like, each one of these games is like the same kind of game in a different setting with some slightly different changes, right?
[213:11.72]Yeah.
[213:13.90]Would you pay like 15 bucks a month for a Souls-like MMO where they just kept fucking adding stuff to it?
[213:22.47]They're making them anyways.
[213:23.33]Uh...
[213:25.54]God Forged?
[213:27.54]But made by FromSoftware not like a: Oh something in this world.
[213:31.54]No. I mean like the next whatever they do is just like: You know what? We keep making this type of game and everybody loves it so let's just like have one go forever.
[213:42.00]I mean honestly that's what Nioh feels like. It- just not with the m like the actual online. I would love the actual online but, but, comes with a big but.
[213:54.34]That this would be being made by like a Japanese company and it would have a whole bunch of like gacha mobile shit.
[214:01.34]Well, MMO - I'm using that term wrong, not an MMO but just like a like a constant like they make Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3.
[214:10.34]They make Bloodborne, they make Elden Ring.
[214:13.34]You're- you're just saying live service Dark Souls.
[214:15.34]Yes and it's just like that- it's just you don't have to worry about it.
[214:18.00]Oh, when's the next DLC? Like it's just gonna happen. It's gonna be like a WoW patch.
[214:20.00]Like every like 4 or 5 like 3 or 4 months.
[214:25.65]I think, on paper, that sounds great.
[214:28.99]That's what I mean.
[214:30.14]But I think it would actually be fucking awful.
[214:32.34]Yeah, in practice, it would be probably terrible, but...
[214:36.03]don't know I just feel like I I love these games I feel like they wouldn't be able to execute that without completely killing the vibe of like hey for Halloween we got the new update to souls 14. that's right you guys are gonna get like oh we're pumpkin hats and like there's like just like all the weird themed cosmetics everyone be running around I didn't think of like bizarro
[214:57.64]I didn't think of the it's Christmas time you can dress up as a tree and transform using your talisman into a present I forgot about the the oktoberfest update that would happen yeah yeah but I mean like in theory if that if like without the pessimism of it being bad because I feel like there's a two percent chance it makes it through like all of like
[215:24.29]the business dealings for them to get, like, the money grant to be able to do some live service multi-year thing.
[215:30.15]Well, hold on.
[215:30.51]They can get through all that, and it's not like... How many DLCs did Dark Souls 2 have?
[215:34.86]It was a bunch.
[215:35.76]Wasn't it, like, four?
[215:38.98]Uh... Two?
[215:40.92]Three.
[215:41.32]There were three, yeah.
[215:43.56]So there were three DLCs for Dark Souls 2, and people always go, oh, man, it's awesome.
[215:48.18]Isn't one of the things you say that one of the reasons why you like Dark Souls 2 so much more than the other ones is why?
[215:54.29]how much content how much content there is why Elden Ring is pretty great but isn't that kind of that that doesn't like I think you might get what you're saying within a couple years of like Elden Ring was like crazy financial successful raised a bunch of eyebrows people are like oh Souls games people have been playing for like 10 years time to like come in and ruin it
[216:17.46]Yeah, somebody made a good point.
[216:18.32]If you like a franchise long enough, like, we're getting dangerously close to, like, man, I miss the old FromSoft.
[216:23.81]I don't want it to happen.
[216:24.99]It's true.
[216:25.61]And I hate, like, if I'm jinxing it, my bad.
[216:28.47]But, like, these are the... We're in the good times.
[216:31.43]And you gotta appreciate...
[216:32.77]somebody said this is actually kind of a good point is like art is finite it should be kind of in this world and I think if you don't let a game like this be finite then you maybe are going down the road where it just ruins everything and where are we going I don't know we're just talking how did we end up at the end of a ledge how did we end up here I don't even get across somehow
[217:02.93]I agree on that.
[217:03.79]Like, everyone got to play through the same thing at the same time and get excited about the same stuff.
[217:08.07]Yeah.
[217:09.11]And the moment that it does become, like, MMO-y, everyone's like, what's the quickest way to end game?
[217:13.83]Because I just want to, like, grind Malenia for Malenia's godsend set.
[217:18.59]Yeah, that's true.
[217:23.71]yeah I think it's just like it's a it's such a good thing and it's such a it's such a unique experience that it's almost you sit there and go god damn it I wish I could have that unique experience again but it's here it already exists you already had it fuck dude I mean I'm just excited to see them explore like different settings again and see how Armored Core turns out
[217:56.10]I never played any of the Armored Cores.
[217:57.90]Were they fun?
[217:58.38]I don't even know what kind of games they are.
[218:01.24]I believe we had this conversation, and yeah, I loved, like, Armored Core 1 and 2 were amazing.
[218:06.00]I went to go get an item, and I got annihilated.
[218:09.32]That's unfortunate.
[218:12.49]I mean, like, I just thought, like, we're all doing it.
[218:14.65]Everyone's doing it.
[218:16.45]I'll just drop 60k souls real quick.
[218:25.53]The armor core games are really good.
[218:26.91]I think they got like early on.
[218:28.79]It was like slower, more Dark Souls, like slow, big mechs.
[218:32.53]And if you put on a whole bunch of armor, your mech would like be slower.
[218:35.78]And it started to get towards like three, four or five.
[218:38.74]It got a lot more anime and I didn't really play those.
[218:42.24]And I'm kind of hoping and assuming it's going to be a little bit more like the older ones.
[218:47.68]Yeah.
[218:51.42]Yeah, you are.
[218:54.08]Because lightning coming from.
[218:56.79]I did the Mario thing where you jump, like, you freak out.
[218:59.53]Even though you make the jump, you still jump a second time, third time, because you just don't, you thought you were going to miss the edge.
[219:06.66]Is that three fall jokes today?
[219:08.02]Is it a little bit played out, you think?
[219:11.49]Well, I mean, you did miss that jump in the lava place, like, 40 or 50 times, so I think I can fall a few times.
[219:17.41]Okay.
[219:18.65]Yeah.
[219:28.84]Ooh, Whirl of Flame.
[219:45.24]Okay.
[219:46.48]Okay.
[219:47.68]At like E3 comes around, it's like June, and there's like a Dark Souls or like a Bloodborne announcement, like Bloodborne moon rising.
[219:56.10]And, like, holy shit.
[219:57.26]That, like, it's just, like, a cinematic trailer looks amazing.
[219:59.86]Looks so good.
[220:00.32]And at the end, when it says, like, what consoles and everything it's on, it's like, okay, this was made by Nexon.
[220:08.75]How are you feeling after that?
[220:10.51]I don't know about that.
[220:16.11]Well, I think that goes back to what you were asking.
[220:21.06]Yeah.
[220:23.94]I think...
[220:28.42]Hmm.
[220:31.43]Yeah, I don't know about that.
[220:42.43]What if I told you that this game was ass and there's nothing you could do to convince me otherwise?
[220:46.83]I would tip my hat to you and say, good day, good sir.
[220:49.91]We have different opinions.
[220:52.07]Enjoy the rest of your evening.
[220:55.45]I got the Magma-Whip Candlestick.
[221:02.10]I think, uh, when someone says you can't change my mind about this.
[221:06.76]Yeah, that's like the, oh, then I'm not going, I'm not going to try.
[221:10.56]You really expect me to do anything else other than not talk to you anymore.
[221:13.44]It's like, hold on a minute here.
[221:15.62]Listen to me.
[221:16.60]Let's talk about this.
[221:18.26]You've already, you've already given me no opportunity to, uh, to give you an argument.
[221:25.87]I would just say, yeah, alright.
[221:29.47]Have, have a good day.
[221:36.83]It's like, hey, hey, Jeremy.
[221:39.63]Pizza's disgusting.
[221:41.01]I think it's fucking gross.
[221:42.93]What do you say about that?
[221:43.69]You think you're going to convince me to eat pizza?
[221:46.63]No, that's more pizza for me.
[221:47.89]I can't convince you of something you already don't want or don't like.
[221:54.99]You've already made up your mind.
[221:58.11]And it's almost like you want me to argue with you so you can argue your points back to me.
[222:05.75]Why you think I'm wrong.
[222:07.25]This is your wrong scenario.
[222:09.73]And I want to prove why.
[222:12.37]Sorry.
[222:12.68]I'm not going to give that opportunity to you.
[222:16.72]We can go over to the tree that's over there because there's usually a Crucible Knight and item.
[222:20.20]Or we just go up to a giant dead mermaid.
[222:23.34]You make the call.
[222:28.69]Mermaid.
[222:29.01]Mermaid.
[222:35.54]Which this is not how you get there.
[222:37.78]I don't think it is.
[222:41.83]I know this is a really, really stupid question to ask, but you definitely didn't do like the secret boss that's up here when you fight the deathbed companion, all of her champions.
[222:52.37]No, I did that.
[222:53.31]You did.
[222:53.73]That's actually surprising.
[222:55.09]That's not really a secret.
[222:56.65]I mean, that's like you have to do a very specific bunch of shit in a row to do that.
[223:00.32]I don't think so.
[223:01.36]You don't?
[223:01.68]Don't you have to do her whole quest line?
[223:04.52]I thought you just show up.
[223:06.34]Oh, I thought you had to do her whole quest line.
[223:09.08]Coke Zero or Diet Coke?
[223:10.30]Neither.
[223:11.54]I don't like either one of them.
[223:21.35]Just give me a smaller regular Coke so I can... Alright.
[223:25.33]I would rather drink less regular Coke than more Coke that doesn't taste that good.
[223:33.55]I want to drink less of the... If sugar and all that and calories or whatever is what you're concerned about, I would just... I don't want to drink a full 12-ounce can.
[223:41.53]If you get a two-liter, just have a little bit.
[223:45.81]I'd rather have the full flavored one, but less of it.
[223:49.28]I really don't like... I know a lot of people love the way that Diet Coke tastes.
[223:54.14]It tastes like flavored air in your mouth after, and people go, yeah, that's the point.
[223:59.04]That's why I like it.
[223:59.70]It's like, okay.
[224:02.59]And I'm telling you right now, you are not going to convince me otherwise that Diet Coke is good.
[224:09.25]Go on.
[224:11.61]Come on.
[224:13.57]I mean, I don't... I don't have a stake in this.
[224:20.76]Where did you... Where are you?
[224:23.00]Did you go up?
[224:24.30]I went up.
[224:25.54]It's Moog.
[224:27.98]Did you just seriously spoil my... It's fucking Moog.
[224:31.20]Get up here.
[224:36.94]I mean, you're talking about drinking air.
[224:40.37]Wandering around.
[224:41.19]It's because Coke, Diet Coke, when you take a sip out of it, it kind of disappears in your mouth and leaves this weird air-flavored, flavored like sugar air.
[224:54.04]You don't know what I'm saying.
[224:55.44]The people that get it, get it.
[224:58.06]Magicians actually use it.
[225:00.46]When you take a sip of Diet Coke, it goes like... And it's this weird, like... Like someone breathing in your mouth.
[225:08.82]I'm telling you, it's... Why do I have so... I just got so many... Shit keeps falling off the trees.
[225:16.13]I just... Yeah, what the fuck?
[225:17.83]It's got, like, 15,000 souls?
[225:19.65]Wait, did I... I didn't just activate that, right?
[225:25.85]It's aftertaste.
[225:28.60]Yes, it is an aftertaste, but it's like an airy aftertaste.
[225:31.38]That's what I'm saying.
[225:32.26]Dude, hold on a second.
[225:33.96]I just got another 10,000.
[225:34.70]Yeah, same.
[225:34.96]Hold on.
[225:35.56]Respawn everything.
[225:55.85]Yep.
[225:58.01]Cool.
[225:58.31]I just got another 11k.
[225:58.73]Alright, let me level up one more time.
[226:05.08]The last time I got this much shit for free, it was on Game Pass.
[226:10.96]Yeah, I mean, I could believe that.
[226:13.76]Considering that in the last, like, two weeks alone, Monster Hunter Rise came out.
[226:18.12]On Game Pass, you can just download it.
[226:21.02]On top of that, Hi-Fi Rush comes out.
[226:23.70]It's on Game Pass.
[226:24.64]You can just get it.
[226:25.76]GoldenEye Remaster.
[226:27.22]It's on Game Pass.
[226:28.84]It's like a hundred fucking dollar value.
[226:31.11]You've got to be kidding me.
[226:32.15]Like, just actually kidding me.
[226:34.83]It actually is, Mohg.
[226:35.53]You're right.
[226:46.89]um so do you want to fight him solo do you want to fight him solo well no you because he's like your favorite and you're you're like wearing his outfit you like are showing up to the boss in his clothes like look I got it too I'm showing up to like comic con this is the I'm in the meet and greet line
[227:11.74]He is mugged.
[227:15.20]That's my mode.
[227:15.90]He is mugged.
[227:22.06]Is he going to, like, count down and... He's probably going to do the thing.
[227:25.84]Thought I'd just be aware of it.
[227:33.88]I forget how that works and if we need an item for him to not murder us.
[227:38.87]It's a flask item, but you can heal through it.
[227:43.48]Thank you.
[228:12.89]Aww.
[228:13.59]You got me with a backswing.
[228:14.93]I'm doing a challenge run where I have to get hit by every attack.
[228:19.81]I was going to say, I've heard you scream like a lot.
[228:32.22]I'm going to fucking die.
[228:41.11]Oh, that was quicker than I thought it was going to be.
[229:00.07]He's going to do his thing and we need to heal through it.
[229:02.27]I got one flat.
[229:05.61]Maybe he doesn't do it.
[229:07.81]He should have.
[229:08.19]He should be doing it now.
[229:10.21]Wait, this might be the other Mohg.
[229:12.93]The fake Mohg.
[229:14.01]Yeah, it's the fake Mohg.
[229:15.31]A different Mohg-like.
[229:16.47]No, it actually is.
[229:17.31]Doesn't he have a different name?
[229:19.55]Other than Mohg?
[229:20.92]I think it's Omen or something.
[229:22.04]I thought he had a name like Underbelly Submissive Boy.
[229:27.30]I don't.
[229:27.64]Let's just beat the boss already.
[229:36.05]Hey, remember when you made that joke about me fighting the boss alone?
[229:39.18]Yeah.
[229:40.26]Hey, I'm fucking doing a lot.
[229:43.16]You just don't know.
[229:44.08]Oh, you're so cool.
[229:59.83]I'm such a huge fan, by the way.
[230:04.67]Lord's aid.
[230:07.06]You know what?
[230:07.92]I was going to respect the Faith Support character.
[230:10.88]I feel like I'm playing so bad, I really just should.
[230:15.57]What's her drip?
[230:17.43]This is what you needed all the quest shit for.
[230:19.27]Afterwards, you talk to her to do Placidusics.
[230:22.30]But the initial fight, I think, is always here.
[230:24.24]What did we say?
[230:26.92]That's right.
[230:31.43]I see, for I am the companion of Godwyn.
[230:35.33]I wish to be a mother, so it is I must bear.
[230:40.41]Bottom one.
[230:43.14]Oh, I think I just ruined it.
[230:44.36]Go on, you deny us because we.
[230:47.26]I'm disbanding.
[230:48.00]Oh.
[230:49.58]I want to spend a quick amount of time, I am going to do the respect
[231:04.21]Am I okay?
[231:08.51]I can still choose?
[231:09.65]Okay, good.
[231:09.97]Wait, you let her hold you?
[231:11.77]No, you're supposed to.
[231:12.85]That's how you fight Placidusax.
[231:14.13]You sick fuck.
[231:15.55]That's how you fight Placidusax.
[231:17.04]You fucking horndog.
[231:19.22]I could just go back there.
[231:29.96]Deathbed companion.
[231:32.89]Loathsome Dung Eater.
[231:36.46]Hoarah Loux, chieftain of the Badlands.
[231:40.78]And who could forget?
[231:41.96]The all-knowing!
[231:57.01]It puts me in combat every time.
[231:58.47]I can't leave this area.
[232:00.05]It's annoying.
[232:06.31]Can I take one of these things to go back?
[232:09.41]That's not good.
[232:20.20]How do I get out of here?
[232:27.70]I can't.
[232:33.72]I don't want to run through all this.
[232:35.57]I know I just, whatever.
[232:36.67]But if I miss, I'm gonna... I'm okay.
[232:44.88]I can make it.
[232:46.54]Why am I alive?
[232:47.26]I don't know.
[232:52.48]But doesn't this kill you instantly?
[232:53.74]How come it was killing us instantly?
[233:09.95]Wait, what the?
[233:11.01]That was weird.
[233:17.51]We already did this.
[233:18.61]My brown hole is invaded again.
[233:21.58]It might just keep doing that.
[233:24.10]Maybe.
[233:25.50]They died in three hits this time.
[233:27.90]Wow, 100 souls, thanks.
[233:31.08]Oh yeah, check your bells.
[233:33.28]My bells?
[233:34.42]Your bell bearings.
[233:35.88]Oh, good idea.
[233:37.38]I want to just teleport out of here.
[233:45.58]Did I go the wrong way?
[233:46.36]I mean, I'm just trying to get far enough away from where I was to teleport.
[233:52.14]Golden Order Seal boosts fundamentalist incantations.
[233:55.06]Do you remember what those are?
[233:58.42]What counts as fundamentalist?
[234:00.10]I think some of the big fire spells count.
[234:08.30]The black flame stuff, I think.
[234:15.08]the holy light one oh it's lightning do you have any seals I only have a Golden Order and dragon communion I do have some seals I have dragon communion and I gave you the other one whatever it was yeah that's the Golden Order I guess I'll use that one okay let's really get the hell out of here
[234:46.94]It's not opening my goddamn game.
[235:06.09]What do I do now?
[235:08.01]You went the wrong way.
[235:09.07]Rest, go down the ladder.
[235:15.58]I just want to teleport the fuck out of here.
[235:19.10]Uh, go into the castle?
[235:22.24]Read chat.
[235:23.06]I'm staring at you right now.
[235:24.58]It's just... Read chat.
[235:27.07]Read chat is... There are... There are 5,000 messages.
[235:31.35]Which one?
[235:33.11]Read chat.
[235:34.77]I'm just going to fucking go this way.
[235:36.01]I'm going to end up dying.
[235:52.30]I'm just running around in circles until I figure out where the hell I'm supposed to go.
[235:59.09]That's a bunch of garbage.
[236:00.03]My bell bearings are all... ...ball-likes.
[236:05.25]I think I can go through here.
[236:09.99]Can I go through here?
[236:21.63]How does he not remember doing this multiple times?
[236:24.51]Because this area is fucking enormous.
[236:26.45]And there's so many random ass places to go.
[236:29.37]And they all look pretty identical.
[236:31.24]So they're all the same place in my brain.
[236:32.58]Where are you trying to go?
[236:36.18]I'm just trying to get to any race.
[236:38.24]But I can't go anywhere.
[236:40.66]Oh, you're trying to get a close.
[236:41.63]You're trying to Malenia right now.
[236:43.33]I'm trying to get the hell out of this area.
[236:45.85]But it won't let me.
[236:49.29]Then inside the building to the left, then you go down the stairs.
[236:51.95]That's where I was thinking of going, but there's somebody scary there.
[236:55.60]That's where we were spawning earlier with the bird in the way.
[236:57.40]That's what... I just didn't want to get blocked by that.
[237:06.76]And then down the stairs here, right?
[237:10.92]My Finger Reader, receive equipment of champions.
[237:15.12]She's got Ash of War kick.
[237:18.06]Wow.
[237:22.13]This guy's just gonna fuck it all up for me, I know it.
[237:24.35]Gonna chase me.
[237:29.55]Okay.
[237:40.43]Kick is OP.
[237:51.00]Is kick... I mean, kick is actually pretty good.
[237:57.97]Yeah?
[237:59.99]Is it?
[238:04.05]Bro, am I even going the right direction?
[238:06.51]Yep.
[238:09.03]That bird wasn't even there before.
[238:14.28]When was that bird here?
[238:16.36]Lightning isn't faith scaling.
[238:19.06]Yes, it is.
[238:32.64]wait it's not lightning is dex yeah I got lightning ram and it's dex I I don't have the only thing I've been missing is I don't have a single face ash award I wish I could drop them because I think I have two or three of them
[238:52.96]I don't think I have the.
[238:55.65]The thing to make them faith.
[238:59.63]Oh, the actual doors are open now.
[239:04.89]Are you?
[239:06.27]I interpret.
[239:08.37]Let's go with great anchor until it was the tragic across the far.
[239:14.24]But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[239:16.82]The dragon communion seal skills on arcane, right?
[239:22.04]I could do that.
[239:24.38]Wait, I could put it on a weapon and drop it.
[239:26.38]Really?
[239:30.95]That's kind of cool.
[239:31.53]I didn't know that.
[239:32.35]Okay.
[239:36.11]Let me see what I have.
[239:44.00]I have Sacred Blade.
[239:46.36]And I think I can put it on a weapon and just give it to you.
[239:53.27]That's actually a good idea.
[239:54.47]If I gave you my longsword.
[239:55.97]Yeah, and I could just put it on and just give it back.
[240:00.05]I'm thinking because I have actually a whole bunch of stuff that scales with a cult.
[240:04.05]I could use the dragon communion.
[240:09.92]But does that scale just as good as the other seals?
[240:17.48]I think the dragon seal scales with arcane, but
[240:24.38]It also just can be used as a seal for every other spell.
[240:27.18]I think it just depends on what the spell is.
[240:30.66]Yeah, I just want to make sure I'm not like screwing myself in some obscure way.
[240:34.46]I'm going to do arcane.
[240:36.32]I should have another larval tier.
[240:37.76]I'm just going to go arcane, which is also good because that's a magic find for items and it's all random.
[240:43.21]So maybe we get more better stuff.
[240:44.95]Dragon communion scales to S with arcane at level 10.
[240:48.13]Apparently.
[240:48.55]Okay.
[240:51.01]Okay.
[240:51.86]Is there any other fun stuff that I want to use?
[240:53.32]Maybe I'll be like a... Maybe I'll do the bubble thing.
[240:57.38]That's kind of fun.
[240:58.64]Then that's the play.
[241:01.44]Do you guys want me to level up the big bubble horn?
[241:08.69]Do you have a Smithing Stone somber five?
[241:12.39]I probably do.
[241:13.17]Let me see what I'm missing.
[241:18.03]I have a somber stone five.
[241:23.66]Do you have a nine?
[241:24.44]Is there a nine or does it go straight to dragon?
[241:26.38]There is a nine and I also have a nine as well.
[241:28.76]OK, I need a five and a nine.
[241:31.47]I can give you both of those.
[241:34.21]OK, then I'm going to go.
[241:36.83]Respec again, I guess.
[241:44.07]Oh, the bearings, yeah.
[241:47.48]Check your bearing shop if you haven't.
[241:53.70]Yeah, I did.
[241:54.84]When does she go sit?
[241:57.83]Oh, you have to get her to, yeah.
[242:00.73]Her shop will be randomized too, won't it?
[242:02.85]Does she have a shop?
[242:03.77]I think she sells some random shit, doesn't she?
[242:11.72]The Finger Lady.
[242:13.88]Oh, the Finger Lady does have a shop.
[242:15.22]It's not just remembrances.
[242:36.22]This thing is pretty cool.
[242:41.10]This is like fire.
[242:41.90]It's like a blood fire colossal hammer.
[242:57.24]Sharpened, yeah, volcano fragment.
[243:04.11]I mean, it's 1800.
[243:04.49]I'm just gonna buy it.
[243:13.39]The weapon rewards will be randomized if you bring remembrances to her.
[243:17.90]Worth looking.
[243:18.60]Okay, cool.
[243:23.98]Now you can finally play as me, Strong.
[243:27.78]point very good point you've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers have you then I bitch I am known as a tarnished eye you now belong to us okay we're Ster we're in separate worlds just getting our shit together
[243:56.32]Yeah, I gotta pick up my order.

[244:02.04]The Litany of Proper Death.
[244:04.88]Creates an image of order to deal holy damage.
[244:14.77]Holy shit, I have so many... I have so many bearings.
[244:21.09]Holy shit.
[244:22.09]Alright, we're gonna be here for a little while.

[245:53.40]The death root.
[245:55.28]It's quiet.
[245:56.86]I have it.
[246:00.37]Okay.
[246:02.81]Now we need... No, no, no, no.
[246:05.43]Do you have any faith talismans?
[246:07.13]Faith talismans?
[246:10.05]Like the stuff that boosts faith magic or anything weird like that that you're not using.
[246:14.96]Oh, let me find out.
[246:26.04]I have, uh, raises maximum FP, raises dex.
[246:34.60]I don't think I have anything that boosts faith.
[246:40.01]I don't.
[246:43.89]You can only see your other bell bearing shops because you used them in your solo game.
[246:47.31]Oh, shit.
[246:49.15]Well, I'm leaving for a minute.
[246:52.91]You got the items, right?
[246:55.78]Yeah, good.
[246:58.72]Oh shit, we're duping.
[247:08.19]OK.

[247:40.90]8,000?
[247:41.10]Come on.
[247:42.02]What is this bullshit?
[248:01.46]Is that all the bell bearings I had?
[248:02.74]I feel like I've seen all this stuff already.
[248:19.25]By the soul?
[248:19.79]I don't think I really want anything.
[248:32.39]I think I'm ready.
[248:32.89]I think I'm done.
[248:38.15]I need a, you know, like a new outfit to like impress you.
[248:40.91]I never will.
[248:44.07]No matter how cute I look.
[248:55.98]Get the Malenia sword.
[249:00.54]Um.

[249:48.64]Nah.
[249:50.10]Nah.
[249:53.34]I'm pretty much ready, but I am gonna do this because people are gonna be mad if I don't use this weapon.
[250:00.73]Okay.
[250:01.17]I need to get it ready.
[250:02.51]I did give you the stones.
[250:04.21]I gave you the stones.
[250:05.95]And I really needed them.
[250:09.23]Well, I gave you stones earlier, so it's only fair.
[250:12.38]That's true.
[250:15.54]I want to be fair, right?
[250:29.43]Alright, I'm ready.
[250:32.25]I'm going to join.
[250:35.41]No, I probably shouldn't join you here.
[250:37.21]This has problems.
[250:39.19]Yeah, where are we going?
[250:43.38]well we could go we did this do you want to go do the um where class of deuce six is supposed to be that other dragon uh do we have that quest on that quest I don't know what we're supposed to do can we actually do it I doubt it of four to sacks right can we do four to sacks
[251:23.04]got to have the item now you need the finger slayer blade we could go we could go give some death root I feel like we both have a few that we haven't given I have a great rune so I'd like to go somewhere where we can activate it one of the towers um which one is it the unborn

[251:49.77]You do?
[251:50.87]Ooh.
[251:51.21]Alright.
[251:51.53]Well, then let's go back and do the Thea quest.
[251:54.67]Okay.
[251:56.71]So we need to go... Let's just go do it.
[252:02.66]Which is which teleport?
[252:05.02]The roots.
[252:06.22]It's where we just were right before we left.
[252:08.60]That root place.
[252:15.63]No, you have to give the Fingerslayer blade to Ronnie.
[252:20.13]Oh.
[252:21.09]Ah, that's right.
[252:22.73]So, go to Ronnie.
[252:24.65]You don't need the blade.
[252:27.93]I need the curse.
[252:29.00]Yeah.
[252:31.08]Hopefully, if you get it, then I can play too.
[252:37.56]Need Deathmark, not the blade.
[252:39.08]The blade is for Ronnie.
[252:43.61]Uh...
[252:49.93]ronnie's just like jealous alright let's go to ninth mount gailmere campsite and we're going to go back and we're going to run into altus plateau are you okay with that uh I need one second
[253:20.07]Yeah, every quest is going to be a huge pain just because everything's randomized.
[253:23.49]We might just get stuck somewhere and have to turn around.
[253:29.15]You get the death mark from killing Malenia, but it'll be random.
[253:33.64]If we kill Malenia, she'll give us, like, fucking dung.
[253:43.57]I am... I am doing some nasty shit with Fia right now.
[253:49.77]Are you ready to play the game?
[253:53.74]I saw somebody in chat said, hey, dude, like I've been sitting here for like five, ten straight minutes.

[254:03.04]And my popcorn is getting cold.
[254:04.82]I haven't been able to take one bite because I was waiting for you guys to start to do something.
[254:08.93]They're furious.
[254:12.69]He said he's holding it in like big, like holding it all like popcorn.
[254:17.30]How come you got to be embraced by Fia and I don't?
[254:27.04]How is that any bit fair?
[254:37.29]Okay, where were we meeting?
[254:38.95]I was just seeing if I had an item.
[254:42.47]Where are we meeting?
[254:43.27]Where are we going?
[254:44.31]What's happening?
[254:45.11]Who are you?
[254:45.63]Altus Plateau.
[254:46.77]So we're going to go to the 9th Mount Gelmir campsite.
[254:50.82]And then from there we're going to run to Altus Plateau.
[254:55.66]Okay.

[255:50.71]I don't know where we're going.
[255:57.73]We're just following.
[256:01.25]First person to get there also follow me.
[256:03.05]Not that way.
[256:26.91]weird like this is not where Malenia is no it's not another point okay you know we never did we ever fight with that um like the meteorite demon thing was we didn't go all the way up there did we no we did what was up there the tree spirit oh this is tree spirit that's right you know we haven't done the dragon in the starting lake it's true

[257:24.45]Keep going.
[257:33.49]Hey, look at this Grace right here.
[257:34.89]Yep.
[257:39.56]That's crazy.
[257:40.16]It is pretty crazy.
[257:41.60]There's also items galore.
[257:51.73]First boss here is you get like invaded by what's his name there?
[257:58.69]Target, right?
[258:05.24]Oh, we're going in the city?
[258:07.58]Well, isn't it right when you get through the front door of this Alta Plateau, he shows up, right?
[258:12.54]Yeah, and he's like, you aren't good enough.
[258:15.74]Okay, how do we get down?
[258:16.66]I think we have to go over here.
[258:17.82]I think you just jump.
[258:19.72]I think you go this way.
[258:26.70]There's a squid in a chair.
[258:29.56]That is a squid sitting in a chair.
[258:33.28]I'm beating you.
[258:35.38]It's not over yet until we get into Altus Plateau.
[258:51.29]It's a long ladder.
[258:53.41]Hey, could you just hold B?
[258:54.51]My hands kind of hurt when I do that.
[259:07.76]Alright, watch out for the lobster.
[259:22.09]Another dragon heart.
[259:26.91]OK, here we go.
[259:34.01]And your winner.
[259:36.12]JURBA!
[259:41.23]How do you get down to where Moog is?
[259:43.15]I thought you did that from Nokron.
[259:48.07]You... It's like a teleport from somewhere, I think.
[259:54.48]Oh, from the four ways teleporters?
[259:58.68]Yeah, the place with the blue keys.
[260:03.36]Blue stone sword keys.
[260:04.79]Hmm, hmm, good theory.
[260:06.87]OK.
[260:09.35]It let's let's explore.
[260:13.39]Probably something interesting down here.
[260:19.11]Actually pretty useful.
[260:25.50]Fuck.
[260:31.90]Is there runes that go down here?
[260:36.32]Crab.
[260:38.70]Crab.
[260:40.68]Crab.
[260:41.09]Watch out.
[260:41.67]Crab.
[260:42.61]I see it.
[260:44.43]There it is.
[260:44.87]Over by me.
[260:48.09]It's probably a bad idea to just walk up there with the horse.
[260:52.09]It's one of these guys.
[260:52.75]It's a Mohg like.
[260:53.59]I don't know.
[260:57.77]I don't know.
[261:03.93]Is that thing bigger than normal?
[261:14.87]This thing is just right in front of me.
[261:17.11]How?
[261:25.02]Why did I just hear a dragon?
[261:26.58]That was me.
[261:27.94]I'm Dragon Boy.
[261:29.32]I did no damage with that.
[261:34.18]Which is kind of surprising.
[261:36.80]Just lagging my game.
[261:39.62]Alright, just come down here.
[261:42.34]Oh.
[261:43.60]Wait, no.
[261:45.34]Yeah, that's sad.
[261:47.03]We got a boss in here.
[261:48.55]You have to hold it.
[261:54.99]Oh, you went downstairs.
[261:58.23]There is a boss.
[262:00.03]Alright, something easy.
[262:01.21]Something simple.
[262:02.99]You first.
[262:08.05]Who is this?
[262:10.63]Oh, it's one of the invader, like the bell bearing invaders.
[262:14.30]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[262:15.84]This is somebody.
[262:16.20]This person's in that castle.
[262:40.44]I don't like being in this corner.
[262:47.70]Game laggy whenever boss.
[262:53.80]True.
[262:57.35]True.
[262:58.81]Oh.
[263:00.87]Annihilated.
[263:06.12]Thanks for the heal.
[263:07.66]Hey, no problem there, pal.
[263:10.28]No item?
[263:11.68]Oh, just through the door.
[263:19.26]Oh, poison bloom.
[263:21.81]Crap.
[263:31.67]Okay.
[263:36.58]We continue to progress.
[263:45.99]Alright.
[263:46.27]I think we get invaded here by market.
[263:50.85]That's way later up in the castle.
[263:53.98]Is it?
[263:54.30]I thought it was like right here.
[263:55.52]Look all that castle all the way up on the right past the Earth tree.
[263:58.78]You go there and that's where Margaret is.
[264:05.05]Oh, let's kill these.
[264:05.91]Let's do it.
[264:07.27]I'm initiating the pact of let's do it.
[264:15.36]I turn around just being killed by a dog.
[264:20.86]Well, you know what they say.
[264:23.82]Why are we killing these?
[264:25.65]Because they got the item.
[264:28.23]We can just go in the back.
[264:30.25]No.
[264:33.27]This dog's going to kill me.
[264:41.48]It's just a random group of fucking enemies.
[265:02.71]That's a big ant!
[265:08.43]a crazy big shield it's holding yeah you were on crack in the very beginning of this stream by the way I've mellowed out a bit but I really you know it happens don't get rod please alright what do you got
[265:38.43]Oh dude, a blessing of the ancient old ones.

[266:18.63]Do you want hamburger helper?
[266:21.19]Um, uh, dude, if I could go for like, uh, like a man, which I didn't know you were a fan of Fluffy Joe's.
[266:30.78]I am come up this way.
[266:31.72]There's the the the Godskin Noble who's probably like.
[266:34.54]I don't know.
[266:37.88]Like, oh, the windmill.
[266:42.98]I love sloppy Joes.
[266:44.94]Same.
[266:47.30]I don't really have them that often though.
[266:51.04]They're incredibly hard to make.
[266:55.27]It takes a lot.
[266:56.91]You need to be like a professional chef.
[266:59.85]I'm kind of... You lagged out and I don't know where you are.
[267:03.25]I'm at the windmill.
[267:04.27]You can teleport here if you want.
[267:05.74]I'm at the bonfire at a windmill.
[267:08.12]The game is putting you in many different locations.
[267:18.15]Yeah, if you don't simmer it just right, then you can really ruin it.
[267:26.27]Are you mocking me?
[267:28.95]I mean, I'm making just like a general joke about making a sloppy Joe.
[267:32.28]Are you mocking me?
[267:35.58]I'm mocking just making sloppy joes, which is, I like them.
[267:38.90]I'm just, we're making a funny joke that like, oh, look, it's a lot of work to make a sloppy Joe.
[267:44.22]You know what?
[267:44.96]I think you would like crack too.
[267:51.42]alright this is a really important question for you Ster do you put cheese on your sloppy Joe yes or no like on the bun do you smoke it or do you inject cheese on my no okay no that's a good answer that sounds up like what was the point of making like a messy disgusting thing and you're gonna like I don't know some people put like a slice of American cheese on it and I don't agree
[268:22.13]No, I've never had cheese on one.
[268:23.27]I feel like it's enough on its own.
[268:26.08]Yeah.
[268:27.00]I'm glad we agree.
[268:30.90]And the boss is a Tree Sentinel.
[268:35.18]Hopefully, I think it's just a regular one.
[268:50.37]Yo, hold aggro for a second.
[268:51.93]I've got a big spell I can let loose.
[268:53.81]Charging up my spirit bomb.
[268:55.55]I can't lock on to him because he's a fucking... You're dead.
[268:57.89]You're just talking and all I can think of is you speaking.
[269:00.51]I can't lock on to him.
[269:03.55]I just heard you say, hold on, take aggro.
[269:05.35]And I'm just like, I'm just going to let him talk for a little while.
[269:07.15]And then I just forgot how to fucking play and I lost it.
[269:13.13]I was doing fine until you started yelling commands.

[272:51.38]Something about the way you look right now.
[272:56.76]He just doesn't stop.
[272:58.58]It's like the big cape, the regal, like, I don't know, ornate shit you have there, the big mask.
[273:07.61]He doesn't let up.
[273:11.01]Alright, like, where do you want to go then?
[273:14.03]Okay, so that was fun.

[273:17.91]Let's get this map fragment.
[273:20.67]So let's go.
[273:31.05]sloppy Joe though I'm telling you if you keep saying that then the stream is going to end because I'm going to go I'm going to want to go make one do you have it come on man you don't have a can of man which just ready to go under any circumstance well that way you're making a big mistake no I have a whole bunch of like pre-made meals left in a backpack
[273:57.14]Hold on.
[273:57.84]Left in a backpack?
[273:59.86]What do you mean?
[274:00.40]Yeah, I have to explain that.
[274:02.55]Because I did not expect a human to say that.
[274:06.51]Is this like DayZ?
[274:08.11]What do you mean?
[274:08.81]There's like food in your backpack?
[274:11.87]Well, my wife's in the chat and she's crying because I brought it up again.
[274:15.33]So I don't think I can talk about it anymore.
[274:18.13]Oh, that kills you.
[274:18.77]Don't do it.
[274:22.16]Okay, you already did this once with the fucking Zelda clip again.
[274:27.06]Fall joke is overrated.
[274:29.00]I didn't think that was going to actually kill me.
[274:31.06]I didn't think that was going to actually kill me.
[274:36.12]I thought it was... That didn't look that far.
[274:38.44]That looked fine.
[274:39.36]Alright, anyways.
[274:42.51]What were you saying?
[274:43.17]I... I don't got nothing to say.
[274:50.03]You can tell him, do it as a warning.
[274:52.55]The short version of the story is...
[274:54.95]Me and Ashley went to the grocery store yesterday, to get food- like a whole bunch of like the prepared grocery store meals.
[274:59.50]Okay.
[275:01.00]I was like: I'm lazy I just want like a whole bunch of these to eat. Just for me.
[275:03.00]Okay you mean- but when you say prepare it you mean it's like okay there's like a salmon in here. It's already seasoned. It already has the stuff in it. You just put it in the oven.
[275:10.00]Yeah, it's just it's just like a cold cuts of pork chop with like some potatoes and green beans like ready to go in the oven.
[275:17.24]Yeah, yeah. Nothing wrong with that.
[275:20.24]Yeah and we walk, we don't drive. So it's like all in a backpack so we could walk back with it.
[275:25.24]And uh you know just- I went to go eat them- I was like excited like: Oh shit I've got so much food.
[275:30.24]And I went to go get it and there was a- you know was all still in the backpack.
[275:35.36]Like the next day.
[275:36.66]So you just had a bunch of fucking food?
[275:38.62]I did eat one.
[275:40.90]You ate one?
[275:42.76]That's the twist.
[275:43.22]Ster.
[275:43.96]I ate one.
[275:44.69]Ster, you ate a backpack meal that was like raw food in a backpack?
[275:50.01]Yeah.
[275:52.29]And 24 hours had gone by.
[275:54.15]You're saying it like I didn't cook it.
[275:55.82]First, I did cook it.
[275:58.39]it wasn't it was maybe I don't know it was overnight like 16 hours I think you're missing a lot of the finer points here I don't know dude have you ever watched one of those food time lapse videos where it shows like one hour two hour five hour six hour and then they ants to start coming in and grubs well it is sealed inside of a thing there's like not ants getting in it
[276:23.04]What kind of food was... So you took... So this was a... So you opened up the backpack and you were like... Oh, like... Like, it must have stunk.
[276:31.77]It honestly didn't.
[276:34.57]And then I unsealed the wrap on it and I touched the meat and it was like... A little cold.
[276:39.56]And I was like, hmm.
[276:42.88]Like, it was colder than my hand was.
[276:44.64]You know, it felt a little cool to touch.
[276:47.02]So then you were just like, you know what?
[276:48.30]Fuck it.
[276:48.56]I'm just gonna put this in the oven.
[276:50.08]Like, if I die...
[276:53.48]I die.
[276:54.72]And how long ago was this?
[276:57.57]It was overnight.
[277:00.03]Got it at like 8 p.m.
[277:01.25]at night, and then it was the next day at like 2 p.m.
[277:04.29]Okay.
[277:05.99]So how do you feel right now?
[277:10.28]I ate it yesterday.
[277:11.32]I got to say, I felt a little weird, but I'm good.
[277:15.10]You feel a little weird now?
[277:16.30]I think I'm good.
[277:22.14]Are you coming?
[277:22.94]Like, I'm at the castle.
[277:24.36]I'm sorry.
[277:25.30]I'm... Can't tell you that I've been paying that much attention to the game when I heard that you ate food that's been in a backpack for a fucking day.
[277:32.79]It looked fine.
[277:34.62]no fucking bear grills is like eating his own shit no no no no I'm telling you right now you're I know you're about to go down this path of oh what are you talking about like you probably would no no I would not if if I had like a pork chop that was raw that was on the counter for 16 hours I would not eat it but there's like no other food because that's all the food you got for yourself I would figure something I would figure something out
[278:01.38]Yeah, I figured something out.
[278:02.82]I would eat anything else.
[278:04.66]Anything else.
[278:07.41]No, that's not happening.
[278:11.47]Especially if it's like raw food that's just sitting there.
[278:15.43]What is the... What's the time?
[278:17.93]It's two hours, right?
[278:20.03]Two hours is like when bacteria really starts to grab a hold of food, right?
[278:23.51]When it's out?
[278:23.87]A bit of bacteria is good for you.
[278:26.81]It's four.
[278:27.23]Okay, so four hours went by.
[278:30.58]Okay, well, hopefully you don't have any issues.
[278:32.80]Alright, I don't know where the fuck I'm going right now.
[278:38.88]Stuart, can we teleport back to the windmill village?
[278:43.66]Can you help me?
[278:44.28]This fucker's judging my fucking backpack raw meat meal.
[278:50.09]Doesn't even know where he's going.
[278:52.11]I got to say, though, actually, I was kind of dizzy yesterday.
[278:54.45]Bridges didn't exist for thousands of years in human history.
[278:57.65]Yes, but they were curing their meats.
[279:00.25]It's not the same.
[279:01.27]It's not... It was... That's... Ster's fucking musty-ass backpack is not a curing environment for food.
[279:11.08]That's not... Okay, I ain't gonna have that happen.
[279:20.81]Do you want to?
[279:21.55]I mean, you'll be proud of me at the very least that there was coconut shrimp in there.
[279:25.48]Ooh.
[279:27.04]Everything we talk.
[279:27.84]Yeah, you're absolved of all these crimes.
[279:29.34]OK, well, I was just going to say that I didn't eat the coconut shrimp.
[279:32.33]Ashley was like, that's fish.
[279:33.49]And I was like, good argument.
[279:34.65]Good point.
[279:35.37]Oh, yeah.
[279:35.89]Don't eat that.
[279:37.73]But somehow, what was the food?
[279:39.95]The actual food you ate?
[279:41.09]The actual food was pork chops and potatoes and green beans.
[279:43.93]That's just as bad.
[279:46.01]I don't know.
[279:46.47]It's not fish.
[279:47.27]Raw pork is arguably probably, I would even say maybe even potentially worse.
[279:51.11]It's fucking, it was like eight bucks, dude.
[280:01.65]Fucking for real right now?
[280:02.83]Uh-oh, look out.
[280:06.74]They don't even shoot.
[280:08.82]Raw fish is sushi, though.
[280:10.44]Well, raw fish is sushi, but it's not sushi that's been sitting on the restaurant table for 16 hours.
[280:15.87]Yeah, we left the sushi out overnight in our backpack.
[280:21.53]That would be fucking disgusting.
[280:27.59]Honestly, what do they do to sushi?
[280:29.70]No, but hey, police people are telling me that I have this wrong.
[280:32.94]We're not talking about a TV dinner.
[280:34.28]We're talking about it was raw food that you had to put in the oven and cook it.
[280:38.15]Yeah, it was just like raw pork chop.
[280:40.35]See?
[280:41.35]It's not like a TV dinner.
[280:42.67]It's not like Stouffer's.
[280:47.11]Just like in an aluminum tray with like plastic wrap around it.
[280:51.81]Pork chop.
[280:54.58]I actually can't believe you ate that.
[280:58.26]Honestly, same though.
[281:01.83]So what was the scenario?
[281:03.41]You're just like, you know what?
[281:04.43]I don't care what happens to me.
[281:05.99]I'm just going to eat this.
[281:06.99]I was thinking about it for like a day and I had no other food and I looked at them all and I was like, you know what?
[281:14.78]Well, if you feel... There he is!
[281:18.80]Oh, shit!
[281:24.93]That was... He's not really that scary, actually.
[281:37.56]Honestly, if I were him too, I wouldn't say anything either.
[281:42.20]You just shut up and disconnect as quick as you can.
[281:44.13]Yeah, just literally pull your Ethernet cable out.
[281:48.57]And make a new account.
[281:55.10]It's like, what are the signs if I have worms?
[282:03.02]Probably gastric upset, I would say.
[282:04.76]Probably number one.
[282:05.48]Is that a talisman?
[282:13.26]It is not.
[282:14.00]What the hell is that thing?
[282:19.31]Gastric issues.
[282:21.87]I would say diarrhea.
[282:24.15]How have you been?
[282:26.51]You think I'd feel a little tickle?
[282:29.27]I would imagine you would feel quite a few gurgles if it were me answering.
[282:35.82]So, I know that everyone, whenever they're talking about hands, the thumb is always the...
[282:45.31]kind of the hero of the hand.
[282:46.57]Everyone's like, oh, the human hand, the thumb.
[282:49.33]How do you feel about, like, I feel like fingernails are kind of underrated.
[282:53.33]Not even remotely close to thumbs.
[282:55.23]Not even close.
[282:56.17]In fact, I think the raw pork has mutated your brain at this point.
[283:00.47]I think the raw pork has mutated his brain.
[283:03.12]You think that an opposable thumb is not as important as your fingernails.
[283:07.18]Can you imagine not having, like, fingernails and just having, like, just, like, normal... I think these are the worms talking.
[283:20.00]Yeah, I think scientists have said that eventually we might just evolve them out.
[283:24.77]Like, they just won't exist anymore.
[283:26.23]Really?
[283:26.57]I think so.
[283:27.57]That's been a debate.
[283:29.75]I use them so much, though.
[283:31.23]Like, you have to, like, really pick at something.
[283:34.29]Like, you drop something between your keyboard.
[283:36.47]Like, how are you going to get it out if you don't have fingernails?
[283:38.83]I mean, that's one tiny, shitty little thing to use.
[283:42.41]I mean, you could use, like, a... I mean, we're using them.
[283:47.67]I don't my fingernails are used.
[283:49.47]I'm like scratching my ass.
[283:53.53]I think I'm just all I'm saying is I don't think fingernails get enough credit because the thumb takes all the fucking glory.
[283:59.31]Give me a fingernail tier list of things you can do with it.
[284:02.55]That's what are you saying is like, OK, number one.
[284:06.27]Do you not?
[284:07.45]Because picking up like a coin on your desk, if that's S tier for you, I'm sorry that that is a good example.
[284:14.06]Thank you.
[284:14.42]I didn't even have to come up with that one.
[284:16.81]that's like d you ever like scratch a dog yeah that's gone if you can't like really get underneath the like the fur and like give them a real good scratch you can't do that without fingernails I think you could still get like friction hold on a second your dog would know the difference
[284:47.97]It still works.
[284:50.01]What about peeling an orange?
[284:52.53]True.
[284:53.09]You never, never.
[284:54.85]I, uh, when I was young, sorry for, uh, you know, uh, sensory overload alert.
[285:00.50]Don't listen.
[285:01.14]Uh, one of my, my big toenail came clean off.
[285:04.06]Uh, and I gotta tell you, uh, certainly appreciate it having toenails after that.
[285:10.52]I can only imagine for fingers.
[285:12.66]Every single person in the whole world that's here, just all of us went, ah!
[285:18.07]I gave the sensory overload warning.
[285:19.99]It was fair game.
[285:23.15]Sensory overload, I think, is like if you were to dance while singing, not like, hey, this is disgusting.
[285:30.10]Oh, I got a rune.
[285:33.10]Great rune of the unborn.
[285:34.30]Oh, that's regular Karius, isn't it?
[285:37.34]I got dragon cult prayer book.
[285:38.98]What do you do with that?
[285:39.64]Because I'm kind of using the dragon thing.
[285:43.28]I think you can now craft stuff.
[285:47.69]Alright.
[285:47.93]Where is this?
[285:50.04]Oh, yeah, it is.
[285:51.98]Yeah, maybe like a gross out warning, not a sensory overload.
[285:55.44]I got to say, I feel bad that everyone is upset that I told them something bad happened to me and not like sensory.
[286:02.48]They don't feel bad for me.
[286:03.96]Sensory overload.
[286:05.74]No, sensory overload is if you were like, hey, just want to tell you sensory overload.
[286:09.93]I got a story to tell you.
[286:11.71]So when I was a kid, you know what I mean?
[286:13.59]That's that sensory overload.
[286:17.97]You didn't see what I did.
[286:20.31]But that, to me, is sensory overload.
[286:22.77]Where the fuck are we going?
[286:23.61]Where's the entrance?
[286:24.13]Or, like, if you started, like, doing, like, spells and, like, flashing a bunch of stuff on the screen.
[286:27.75]If I started doing spells.
[286:29.56]Yeah, if you were casting spells and, like, and there were, like, screams and, like, sound effects, sound effects, sound effects.
[286:34.20]I used the wrong term.
[286:37.46]Hold on.
[286:40.10]Come out here.
[286:42.13]We have a problem.
[286:43.77]What?
[286:44.69]We have a double boss scenario here.
[286:55.41]Oh God.
[286:57.67]I think we focus the one on the right first.
[287:01.17]Help.
[287:10.20]The other boss does not care that we're doing this.
[287:13.46]OK, well that was good.
[287:15.70]That actually saves us a lot of pain and suffering.
[287:19.27]Did we get any other guy?
[287:20.19]I can hit him with a dragon breath.
[287:25.02]okay go for it oh my god insta dead I never even got up where the hell did I just end up it's okay we can zerg him from the spawn
[287:51.16]just like you just change you just change the weather and it just me up so bad oh sorry really
[288:17.78]My stomach doesn't feel so good.
[288:20.66]No, it does not.
[288:22.50]Are you serious?
[288:24.16]Are you serious?
[288:25.38]I don't want to laugh because this is not good if that's happening to you.
[288:28.98]I don't want to laugh, but are you alright?
[288:32.21]I don't have anything else to eat.
[288:37.83]Dude, you, alright.
[288:38.73]Can I tell you what you really should do tonight?
[288:40.99]What?
[288:41.37]Just, like, make some, like, just rice.
[288:44.40]Just make some rice.
[288:46.72]And eat a little bit of rice and, like, some toast.
[288:49.46]And don't eat anything else.
[288:51.38]Don't eat any more backpack daisy food.
[289:05.48]Whoops.
[289:06.26]What?
[289:07.40]I rest it.
[289:08.80]So I probably reset it.
[289:09.60]I don't know where you are.
[289:10.72]You did.
[289:12.40]Oh, great.
[289:13.40]I don't know why I didn't spawn at this bonfire.
[289:15.68]Because I definitely... Dude, you were fighting the whole time then.
[289:20.48]You were like doing good.
[289:21.70]I actually was doing well.
[289:23.48]I had him down to like 40, 30, 45%.
[289:24.34]Honestly, fantastic work.
[289:26.75]We have to fight them both again.
[289:30.05]We have to kill this other one again.
[289:30.89]How about we just don't?
[289:32.73]This is a boss.
[289:33.09]Also, you should like heal.
[289:35.32]don't worry about me and worry about the fucking like diarrhea you're gonna have in 40 minutes beware of the scarlet rot
[290:06.47]Wow, you're not doing too well.
[290:10.45]Have I died?
[290:11.03]I don't see a death thing on the screen.
[290:14.54]Well, congrats.
[290:16.48]You were just waiting.
[290:17.26]You were waiting.
[290:17.96]That Moog-like is low.
[290:23.20]Moog-like is dead.
[290:26.11]Alright.
[290:27.23]Focus!
[290:32.75]Mwah!
[290:47.22]oh that's what that is am I not how am I not hitting this person because uh because he had made a grab animation so you can't oh he was using he was like he's like using a door
[291:10.75]I could reset it again.
[291:12.93]We're not quite dead yet.
[291:16.88]It could be much worse right now.
[291:19.46]It's a really bad place for him to be doing this.
[291:22.78]Come over here.
[291:23.30]Come over here.
[291:24.56]I got the heal ready.
[291:27.62]Just cast it.
[291:31.78]I'm helping.
[291:32.42]I'm helping.
[291:32.84]Come on.
[291:34.26]Focus.
[291:35.40]You're not focused.
[291:37.02]I gotta get that down.
[291:37.92]He keeps doing it.
[292:04.47]He's doing power!
[292:06.85]Oh, fuck.
[292:07.31]He comes down with it.
[292:18.91]I'm going to go reset it.
[292:22.10]We haven't lost yet.
[292:28.10]Yeah, but this isn't going well.
[292:32.50]He said 50%.
[292:34.22]We're okay.
[292:36.50]I mentally give up.
[292:44.52]You can't give up.
[292:47.34]Don't give up.
[292:50.07]don't give up just imagine this is Malenia I mean this is my Malenia I hate this enemy
[293:17.94]Alright, I'm gonna be honest.
[293:19.01]If I had like, Ster with 10% fucking effort, we would probably have already beat this.
[293:25.29]That's fucked up.
[293:30.11]How do I get out?
[293:31.07]Run!
[293:36.42]Fucking Sigma.
[293:44.14]Whaaa!
[293:50.17]You reset... I had... You... Okay.
[293:54.43]I only had like a few... I had... You reset it and I was still fighting the enemy.
[293:58.23]So I had lost out on like four heals because you reset it the first time.
[294:02.19]Okay.
[294:03.01]We'll come back.
[294:04.84]I can't.
[294:05.20]Oh, you can't?
[294:07.04]No.
[294:08.58]Then why was I able to come back?
[294:11.56]Maybe you're the host?
[294:22.38]You can do it.
[294:24.62]I took this boss's health down like 70%.
[294:28.55]Yeah, but he just like spams.
[294:35.95]Like he doesn't even play the game like right.
[294:37.55]You know what I mean?
[294:44.28]Yeah, that's definitely like a Soul Calibur fan take.
[295:06.51]that missed me and you saw it you saw that I missed it actually kind of looked like it did okay can you take this seriously he's also I guarantee you this dude's gonna drop nothing
[295:19.23]there's a if you look down your controller is a I wasn't doing this for a little while the first like a little bit that I was playing but if you look down there's a red B button and if you press that you dodge you should press that when there's like a right at the moment right before you get hit I just didn't know if you know I'll try but my game crashed
[295:48.34]You played so bad, my game crashed.
[295:51.64]Mine's crashed too.
[295:58.22]Well, let's try it again.
[296:08.47]Last time somebody gave you that advice, Jeremy, you growled at them.
[296:12.07]Yeah, I know.
[296:13.56]That's why I thought it was... No, I really did.
[296:19.23]I was fighting that lightning Tree Sentinel outside the city.
[296:21.61]And I was having some trouble.
[296:23.73]And the person's like, what they say was, Hey dude, I don't know if you know this, but the horse has a dodge.
[296:32.16]And I just, I just, I just did it.
[296:34.66]I just, I went off.
[296:40.54]Uh, I think my game is actually broken.
[296:43.50]Uh, mod bat.
[296:45.86]Yep.
[296:46.14]Not the, that's the one I just did.
[296:48.94]Well, I'm in.
[296:49.48]It's almost like the process is still going.
[296:54.56]Hold on.
[296:58.06]Yeah, Elden Ring is still technically running.
[296:59.97]OK.
[297:08.93]Coming back.
[297:10.93]I'm sorry to bring it up again, but.
[297:14.73]I really gotta say.
[297:18.15]I feel like I ate that pork and I got away with it.
[297:20.37]And it was kind of a thrill.
[297:29.59]Okay.
[297:31.02]You say that now and in potentially a few hours from now, on your fourth vomit into the toilet, you're going to be like, that was a dumb thing to say.
[297:39.90]I ate it yesterday afternoon.
[297:41.60]I think if I was going to get sick, I'd be sick by now.
[297:44.50]That's true.
[297:46.27]I really feel like like I fucking you know like I played the gamble and I won don't get used to that don't get used to oh yeah you know what uh that if I that means I could probably do that again and be completely and totally fine no you lucked out big time wasn't there some YouTuber who used to like eat shoes
[298:17.03]That's... I love how that's your justification for this.
[298:22.23]It's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[298:23.72]You see, there's a guy that used to eat shoes.
[298:26.58]What was his name?
[298:28.84]What's his name?
[298:29.92]Shoenights?
[298:30.90]I don't know.
[298:31.65]He named himself after what he ate?
[298:36.33]Alright, you ready to fight?
[298:40.87]Yeah, let's like focus the guy, the easy guy in the right.
[298:45.09]Somebody said, Ster, you could have worms and you might not know it.
[298:48.59]You know, hey, do you like... I fucking cooked it, dude.
[298:50.96]It doesn't matter.
[298:51.66]Do you like garlic?
[298:53.98]Are you telling me that worms are immune to heat?
[298:57.08]Worms don't like garlic is the thing I've heard.
[298:59.90]I don't know.
[299:00.84]I think worms actually don't like garlic.
[299:04.18]That's real, right?
[299:05.08]I heard worms don't like your fucking stream, dude.
[299:10.37]Let me heal you.
[299:11.63]You could save flasks.
[299:12.63]You know what I mean?
[299:13.13]Like a greater heal right here.
[299:17.93]Hey.
[299:20.41]Hello?
[299:26.21]How did I get hit by that?
[299:27.21]I'll give you 20 bucks.
[299:30.19]You just randomly like... Yeah, that's 20 bucks.
[299:40.85]Where is he going?
[299:43.69]Can you hold his aggro for a sec?
[299:45.55]It's happening right now.
[299:46.53]Do whatever you want to do.
[299:50.24]Okay, well, he hit me.
[299:53.00]He's looking at me.
[299:53.92]You hit him harder.
[299:58.76]He doesn't care that you're doing this.
[300:19.47]dude look at this dps we've already done yeah I ran in front of him
[300:53.35]Oh, he's angry with you.
[301:05.13]Oh!
[301:14.31]Phase two.
[301:15.23]Phase two, dude.
[301:15.89]Alright, dude.
[301:17.81]We got this.
[301:19.93]Just saw a fucking strategy guide on this shit.
[301:25.97]They said it's actually.
[301:26.85]You gotta avoid you gotta like there's a dodge button B on the controller right before you get hit.
[301:34.00]You gotta press it.
[301:38.82]I'll look at that.
[301:39.36]I did it.
[301:43.08]Where the fuck is he going?
[301:47.06]This is.
[301:47.56]I think he's stuck.
[301:51.34]That's actually it's kind of bad because yeah, he'll do that.
[302:17.20]watch out dude he's coming for you dude
[302:29.76]Did you get some hits in while you focused on me?
[302:31.34]I'm going to get hit by this, but it's alright.
[302:36.85]I went in the wrong part.
[302:42.43]Why did that take me so long to get up?
[302:45.66]It hit me really weird.
[302:46.68]I don't know what happened.
[303:10.78]Mmm, the choke is real right there.
[303:12.30]Oh my god!
[303:26.07]He's going to grab you.
[303:27.27]Now he's got you.
[303:28.23]You're right in his fucking maw, dude.
[303:29.73]He's got you with the next one.
[303:33.88]You're so fucking bad.
[303:34.88]Last hit.
[303:35.62]Easy.
[303:44.44]Hey, by the way, you are so fucking happy that this just happened because I just got an ability.
[303:51.28]I got a thing that you are going to be obsessed with.
[303:55.12]And by you, I mean me.
[303:56.10]Every time you get an item.
[304:00.10]This is probably the best trinket in the whole game.
[304:04.46]Maximum HP, stamina, equipment load.
[304:11.15]Disgusting.
[304:12.68]Oh, dude, is that the fucking the one with the talisman with the thing?
[304:16.75]I get +2 equipment load, +2 stamina, +2 max health.
[304:21.29]Best trinket in the game.
[304:25.03]Ster, whatever you do, don't put the garlic next to your butthole.
[304:27.47]The worms might crawl even deeper.
[304:30.23]I didn't say that on my stream.
[304:31.37]I just want to make sure everyone knows.
[304:32.65]You didn't.
[304:33.26]Okay.
[304:37.48]Alright, so so true, my friend, we getting into the capital is interesting from here.
[304:51.32]I hope I hope they respond.
[304:54.32]They actually might.
[304:56.98]No.
[304:58.60]OK, so there's a few ways to get into the capital.
[305:03.09]But we could also tell me your favorite.
[305:05.61]You want it?
[305:05.93]Let's do the archery.
[305:08.73]Go to the outer wall battleground and let's do the Earth Tree.
[305:11.13]Actually, yeah, can we do it from there?
[305:19.42]Why are all these heals so dang close range?
[305:26.06]Because it'd be really powerful if you could just do that and heal everybody.
[305:35.34]Sorry, I assumed you didn't know TV dinners were pre-cooked.
[305:37.54]I thought Ster was just eating a soggy, hungry man.
[305:45.79]No.
[305:47.57]No, it's not.
[305:48.55]Yeah, that's... In fact, I would... I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[305:55.20]Like, that's alright.
[305:56.64]Why would it be a soggy, hungry man where, like... Like, I would still cook it.
[306:09.45]Alright, let's do the Earth Tree.
[306:14.57]Soggy cooked.
[306:15.61]Yeah, I'm saying that that wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[306:18.31]That wouldn't be a problem to me.
[306:23.99]You're talking to somebody that actually really genuinely does not hate those Salisbury Steak TV dinners.
[306:31.05]And I talked about this already and everyone was like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[306:34.62]They're okay.
[306:36.38]I don't hate those.
[306:39.77]That whole meal is soggy.
[306:42.37]Do you like sushi?
[306:45.38]Very occasionally, yes.
[306:50.02]Wrong.
[306:52.34]I like... Hey, convince me otherwise.
[306:59.40]Can you convince me?
[307:00.38]What do they do to sushi?
[307:03.94]They cut it up and they put it over a thing of rice or a roll.
[307:09.74]They don't do anything.
[307:11.80]Some, it depends.
[307:13.00]Some places do, correct me if I'm wrong, some places do steam it, right?
[307:18.09]For like a certain amount of time.
[307:21.25]If traditional sushi is just a, it's just fish.
[307:27.13]Sometimes they'll freeze it.
[307:28.81]Like if I didn't want to cook, I wouldn't go out to eat.
[307:32.47]You know what I mean?
[307:34.29]Sushi is... Okay.
[307:38.49]I don't like eating a lot of it.
[307:40.93]If you get... Oh, this is a salmon roll.
[307:43.46]Alright, cool.
[307:44.38]Let me have one.
[307:46.00]Ooh, that's pretty fresh.
[307:46.78]That tastes really good.
[307:48.32]Okay, wait.
[307:49.32]You got a spicy tuna roll there?
[307:50.84]Oh, no.
[307:51.24]Yeah, I'll take one.
[307:52.40]That's raw.
[307:53.00]That's gross.
[307:53.54]Why would you eat raw fish?
[307:55.63]It tastes good.
[307:56.71]I can't cook a pork and you can eat raw fish.
[308:00.81]Um...
[308:02.78]If you- it's not about the food-borne illnesses that you can get from sushi, as long as it's prepared correctly.
[308:10.47]It's- yeah, you can.
[308:12.51]But the difference that you- And you- and you trust the sushi guy you go to at the mini-mall.
[308:17.85]I'm not going to a mini-mall to get sushi!
[308:20.19]Where did you get that from?!
[308:21.19]A mini-mall?!
[308:23.81]The fucking... the uh, gas station?
[308:28.75]No, I'm not- I- I- okay.
[308:32.40]I know that there are people that say, hey, do not, do not dog.
[308:36.52]Oh, my, again?
[308:37.38]Oh, my worst, my least favorite enemy.
[308:42.82]I'm stirred.
[308:48.25]Yeah, look who's on the ground, dipshit.
[308:50.41]Oh, having a good time down there, are you?
[308:55.57]Looks like someone's trying to kill you.
[308:59.55]I'm alive.
[309:00.05]Don't worry.
[309:01.41]Hey, worry about yourself.
[309:03.59]OK.
[309:06.43]I'm going to go over here and worry about myself then.
[309:10.37]I thought we were a team.
[309:16.80]But sushi.
[309:19.20]What sushi?
[309:20.52]No, I said, but sushi.
[309:23.26]It's good.
[309:25.85]It's good.
[309:26.95]But I have to really, really be in the mood.
[309:28.59]I'm only going to have a few pieces.
[309:30.55]I know some people that are like, oh, yeah, yeah.
[309:31.93]Like, give me like five different rolls.
[309:33.35]I'm going to eat all of it.
[309:34.61]No, I'll have some.
[309:36.27]Not that much.
[309:56.71]I'd really like to hit you with that, but whatever.
[310:06.34]Oh my goodness.
[310:08.98]He was targeting you with that at first.
[310:12.10]He did.
[310:12.46]It hit me with the first two.
[310:14.54]This is so unsatisfying to not be able to keep pulse right now.
[310:19.76]You have no idea.
[310:22.20]I just want to keep pulse.
[310:27.48]You say keep pulse one more time and I swear I'm going to leave this fight.
[310:35.62]Who needs you?
[310:38.50]Oh, looks like somebody got hit there, right?
[310:40.68]Somebody got hit.
[310:41.14]Oh, looks like somebody.
[310:41.96]Oh, somebody got hit twice.
[310:43.02]Oh, I wonder if you're going to get hit a third time.
[310:44.90]Maybe three third times a charm.
[310:46.98]Oh, no.
[310:47.42]Look at you.
[310:47.84]Look out for that.
[310:48.72]Hey, watch out.
[310:49.58]He's coming in again.
[310:50.24]Don't worry, Star.
[310:52.99]Don't worry, buddy.
[310:53.85]I'll beat the boss for us.
[310:55.11]Don't worry.
[310:59.91]That'll be bad.
[311:20.84]so so
[311:54.89]You so badly want me to lose so you can scream at me.
[312:09.80]I can feel it.
[312:10.50]I can feel you just going like...
[312:43.03]Oi!
[313:01.91]I'd like my 20 in ones, please.
[313:12.23]You beat it?
[313:12.85]Is he still here?
[313:13.39]Did you beat it?
[313:17.52]I beat it.
[313:18.80]Okay, cool.
[313:21.70]Where are you?
[313:24.66]I went in the bathroom.
[313:26.82]I'm feeling so good.
[313:34.50]Alright, let's go.
[313:36.10]I got 80,000.
[313:37.32]Pick up your souls.
[313:38.03]That's 80,000.
[313:38.29]Alright.
[313:44.39]I was talking to you the whole time, too.
[313:45.53]Did you bring your headphones to the bathroom?
[313:48.09]Mine are wired.
[313:49.86]I don't want the government fucking listening into my gamer talk.
[313:52.88]I was talking so much shit, too.
[313:54.80]It was so... I was like, oh yeah, what about this?
[313:57.40]What about that?
[313:58.08]You were just gone.
[313:58.76]You left.
[314:00.18]Yep.
[314:03.14]You know, that goes with the good old saying.
[314:05.80]How do you get bullied on the internet?
[314:06.90]Just fucking turn the monitor off.
[314:09.04]I didn't even know.
[314:12.02]You were just talking.
[314:12.74]I actually was talking to nobody.
[314:14.92]I wasn't even talking to chat.
[314:16.25]I was just like yelling at you.
[314:17.81]I feel like that means I win.
[314:20.05]It kind of does mean that.
[314:22.67]Yeah.
[314:22.83]No, that's alright.
[314:26.15]I still beat the boss.
[314:28.49]That's called a parry reversal.
[314:31.23]Do we need a great rune to do this?
[314:34.09]We cannot proceed without more Great Runes.
[314:37.01]Oh.
[314:38.03]We need plus one more Great Rune.
[314:39.95]Do we actually need more?
[314:41.71]Yeah, I believe we need two.
[314:46.05]We both have one.
[314:47.99]Can you drop them?
[314:49.87]It's the same one.
[314:51.31]I got the same one you did.
[314:53.12]The Unborn?
[314:55.90]Yeah.
[314:57.44]The Born Again?
[314:58.04]I think we actually have to go back to Millenia.
[315:03.38]Unless we could go... Where could we go?
[315:07.93]What about Kayled?
[315:13.97]Is there anything in Kayled we could do?
[315:19.05]Oh, just random tomes and tomes and... It's just random, right?
[315:27.12]It has seemed like this run has waited a little bit to drop better stuff at more important bosses.
[315:31.65]Oh, that's right.
[315:32.11]The Erud tree.
[315:33.11]Let's do the Erud tree.
[315:36.50]The Erud tree.
[315:40.64]The one that's right here.
[315:42.24]Okay.
[315:46.98]The Ranni quest.
[315:50.76]Also, I have like all the Ranni items.
[315:54.37]we could have a little doll ronnie I have the finger blade I have the cervidus helmet I I've got so much from it I don't know I don't know where it's used when it's used why it's used or what the she's talking about and why she wants the world to be in darkness but I am there for it um
[316:19.50]I feel like every few months I try to remind myself exactly what the hell is going on in this game.
[316:24.74]And I always just kind of get stuck again where I go, wait, what actually the fuck is happening?
[316:29.97]And then I watch Vaati videos for like three hours and then I go, oh, that's right, I know everything.
[316:34.87]And then I forget all of it in like a week.
[316:38.23]Alright, so yeah, there was never a boss down here.
[316:40.80]It was just, I guess technically it's just this group and the stuff in the...
[317:00.27]And... Halo Scythe.
[317:03.27]That's a good item.
[317:05.61]Carrion Glintblade Staff.
[317:09.97]Ooh, I found a Faith Talisman.
[317:12.21]Ooh, I already plus 10 mine.
[317:16.09]I'm not doing it again.
[317:18.99]Oh, no, this is potency of incantations.
[317:20.59]I think that actually... I'll take that.
[317:24.20]I'll take that.
[317:25.10]I'll take that.
[317:25.92]I can't.
[317:26.52]I don't think I can drop this.
[317:27.64]I don't think you can drop these.
[317:30.46]Drop it.
[317:31.60]Drop it.
[317:33.26]Drop it.
[317:35.28]Drop it.
[317:38.26]I can.
[317:38.54]You're welcome.
[317:40.16]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[317:56.30]I was going to wear this.
[317:57.34]Oh, I already had one.
[318:02.23]I already had one and it wasn't equipped.
[318:07.25]Nice.
[318:08.33]Isn't there a cave like right here?
[318:10.11]I think there is.
[318:19.91]It is somewhere here.
[318:21.57]Where is it?
[318:33.16]check the cookbook recipes yeah but we can't craft anything without the crafting item the thing that you get the first minute I got the crafting item they don't seem random they all seem the same okay and it seemed like the uh the first guy at the church of ella was selling the crafting thing no matter what really yeah I bought it from him
[318:57.82]I have a voodoo doll of you.
[318:59.06]What should I do?
[319:00.10]Can you just like, I don't know, put it in front of like the air conditioner on like, you know, like 70 degrees and just let me just chill there.
[319:06.86]Come on, man.
[319:07.32]What are you thinking?
[319:10.54]Oh, it's of you.
[319:11.46]I don't get one.
[319:12.76]Typical.
[319:14.34]Just make it of him instead.
[319:17.04]Can you open up my voodoo doll and like see if there's anything in like the stomach?
[319:21.40]Yeah.
[319:21.54]Open up the stomach part.
[319:22.64]See if there's any worms in there.
[319:25.41]But like carefully.
[319:29.65]Ow!
[319:30.19]You... Popped your pimple.
[319:33.73]You... Say it.
[319:48.06]That dog is very angry.
[319:54.40]We, uh... I mentioned this before.
[319:55.97]Alright, story.
[319:56.45]So if somebody was casting, like, negative magical spells against me, but there were other people casting positive magical spells against me, they kind of just run into each other, right?
[320:09.20]they run into each other like it's I mean if somebody's doing like magical spells to make me feel bad but people are also casting magical spells to make me feel good wouldn't it just be and the answer is very obviously there's gonna be 99 dudes casting positive vibes on you and the one dude's gonna cast negative and that's gonna be like a critical no I don't think so
[320:37.87]Ooh, that's good.
[320:38.67]I have so many Dragon Hearts.
[320:45.03]Comment Azor.
[320:45.90]It's a good thing I'm Faith now.
[320:50.08]Dude.
[320:52.20]Give it up.
[320:53.28]Give it up.
[320:53.62]This is the comment of the year so far.
[320:56.87]We are describing YouTube comments.
[321:01.07]Yeah, that's what I thought it was in reference to.
[321:06.57]no what do you mean I thought you were doing like a like my Twitch chat like sends posi vibes and some people send no no no no I'm talking about like actually casting spells oh well like what kind of spells are they are they pagan rituals I don't know uh are they a cult um something else demonic in nature I could help you with this but I need to know specifics so what what should I like where to like get the negative spells away
[321:36.57]Again, it depends what kind of spells they are.
[321:38.61]Just like it.
[321:39.43]Okay, let's general like general negative spells what you should you should wear.
[321:49.26]Garlic.
[321:49.60]I'm gonna say Old Navy.
[321:53.68]Alright.
[321:58.88]Wear a rune of protection.
[322:02.88]Yeah, the infamous curse.
[322:04.71]The small penis curse.
[322:09.81]I remember... I was pleading with chat to have the... whatever.
[322:18.49]Pleading with God.
[322:20.83]Take it back.
[322:24.71]It's so small.
[322:25.93]Why didn't you just make me a woman?
[322:29.83]Do you ever hear that story when I was getting cursed?
[322:33.77]No.
[322:36.11]Somebody, somebody, somebody came into the chat and they were like, hey, dude, I'm like casting a small penis curse against you.
[322:42.77]And I was like, well, alright, somebody cast one to make it bigger.
[322:47.58]Is that what this is?
[322:48.62]Yeah.
[322:48.84]Trying to see if it's like evening out.
[322:52.15]And I was like, well, but then I was like, wait, half of you shouldn't, half of you do want, because what if it goes too far?
[322:59.81]What if they're like, oh, we all have to do this because we have to help him.
[323:02.76]That would be bad.
[323:03.38]I don't know if I can help you with this.
[323:16.11]Just sounds like, this just sounds rough.
[323:18.37]Rough situation to be in.
[323:28.92]Any updates on how it's been going?
[323:30.78]I'm just seeing what spells they're casting at me.
[323:42.45]Alright, are we... Are we... You can open up my character sheet and see what I have against me right now.
[323:55.84]I don't like this slob.
[324:00.24]I don't think this one has very much health.
[324:05.34]Does not.
[324:09.65]You would think I was getting hit less if my character didn't scream so loud.
[324:14.19]Actually, kind of true.
[324:16.91]Like, why doesn't your character, like, scream at all?
[324:21.97]And my character is like a 13 syllable scream.
[324:25.85]I think that my character does just not as loud.
[324:39.86]Well.
[324:42.50]Alright, so we need to figure out what the hell we're going to do here.
[324:46.30]I'm just following you thinking about I don't know if I could help you with this curse situation.
[324:57.83]We need another great rune.
[325:02.03]But even doing Ronnie's quest will not give it to us because it's probably going to be a random item.
[325:08.22]We need to just find random shit.
[325:11.50]Hey, dude, are you going to shove an entire remembrance up your ass?
[325:17.73]Uh...
[325:25.57]I don't want to give that meme any more attention than I already have, but that was humorous enough for me to read it.
[325:34.17]Alright.
[325:34.47]What about we go in this cave?
[325:37.91]Anything for you, my liege.
[325:39.11]Alright.
[325:39.65]Teleport to the outer wall, Phantom 3.
[325:47.66]You've already voted to warp to this destination.
[325:57.13]We can try Malenia again, but I feel like that's going to give us both headaches.
[326:02.11]I'll heal you.
[326:21.55]Okay, re-warp.
[326:22.95]Try it again.
[326:40.08]Buy hints.
[326:47.01]I'm not going to cast any spells, but instead I'm praying for your salvation in hopes our lovely Lord above will forgive you.
[326:53.33]I appreciate that, though.
[326:54.33]That should help, right?
[327:00.25]I wasn't listening.
[327:01.51]No, thanks.
[327:02.77]Thank you.
[327:03.93]Alright.
[327:07.18]Alright, so from here we're going down to this cave.
[327:10.18]Just because I feel like going.
[327:13.44]Hey, hey, hey.
[327:14.70]Buddy.
[327:14.96]Hey.
[327:15.78]Yeah?
[327:17.28]For the guild.
[327:19.91]For the guild.
[327:24.87]I got the Flame of Frenzy.
[327:26.41]I could do it if I wanted to.
[327:27.97]I have enough faith.
[327:32.53]Could three finger me?
[327:34.59]I could.
[327:41.21]We gotta go down there.
[327:45.83]Don't jump.
[327:46.27]It's gonna get you hurt.
[327:52.90]Oh, yeah.
[327:58.20]Elden Ring.
[328:08.14]What do you think about Go to Millenia?
[328:11.38]No.
[328:11.48]Do you know what I think?
[328:14.38]I don't think I ever saw this in like an Elden Ring video, but it's always the thing that's like, huh, that has me thinking.
[328:20.94]Yeah.
[328:21.54]So the giants don't have heads because their faces are in their bodies.
[328:28.19]You're dead.
[328:29.73]How did you die?
[328:30.43]I honestly don't even fucking know what happened.
[328:34.25]I guess I just got electrocuted like over, I don't know.
[328:43.07]Okay.
[328:44.19]Hey, welcome back.
[328:44.71]You're talking about giants.
[328:46.09]Yeah.
[328:46.25]So the giants don't have heads.
[328:47.63]Their faces are inside their stomachs.
[328:50.11]Okay.
[328:50.61]And then I also had like this weird thought.
[328:52.81]I was like, okay, well, what if their brains in a different spot and their brain is in their hands?
[328:57.37]That's why when you hurt the giant's hands, that's this weak spot.
[329:01.09]It's like the Three Fingers and the Two Fingers is obviously like it's like a giant sized hand.
[329:05.21]I was like, dude, what if these are just like giant brains?
[329:09.96]They do have that.
[329:10.78]They do have heads.
[329:15.71]Uh, I mean, the Two Fingers and the Three Fingers obviously are part of the same hand.
[329:19.31]I think that's, you could probably argue that.
[329:22.49]Part of the same hand that maybe split up and, oh, we have two different philosophies or something.
[329:27.99]I don't know.
[329:29.23]The whole hand, maybe the DLC will put the hand together.
[329:32.38]Possibly.
[329:33.46]Maybe there'll be other full hands.
[329:35.36]Hands are a big thing in this game.
[329:37.50]The hand enemies and stuff.
[329:40.71]There are other Two Fingers, but they're probably maybe the other Three Fingers.
[329:44.45]They were probably all.
[329:45.51]I'm just saying normally enemies weak points is like hit the enemy in the head, but the giant is like, oh shit, hit his hand.
[329:52.96]Hey, easy shield enemy ahead.
[329:55.98]I've got a special special enemy down here.
[330:15.92]What's your favorite haichu flavor?
[330:19.28]My favorite haiku?
[330:20.66]Haichu.
[330:22.44]Flavor.
[330:25.98]The fuck are you saying?
[330:27.24]What is your favorite haichu flavor?
[330:29.36]Can I get an example?
[330:33.26]Okay, so the answer to the question is I've never eaten one of these before.
[330:36.98]Like haichu.
[330:38.09]Like you're sneezing.
[330:38.99]Like my favorite sneeze.
[330:40.27]Mine's mango.
[330:46.09]I like peach.
[330:52.39]Haichus suck?
[330:53.79]What are you... No, they don't.
[330:57.25]Haichu, to me, and I'm a big fan of this company, I'm a big fan of these, but Haichus are if Starburst gave a shit.
[331:07.24]Can you come down here?
[331:09.04]I'm just saying.
[331:18.13]And I love Starburst.
[331:20.43]I love to go to anime conventions and eat Pocky.
[331:24.38]Those are good.
[331:28.38]Strawberry and Cherry Starburst are S+.
[331:36.90]But I'm sorry.
[331:37.56]I feel like they haven't innovated in the game at all.
[331:46.34]The classics need to innovate.
[331:47.86]Well, hold on a minute.
[331:49.06]What about Reese's?
[331:50.47]Look at all the different Reese's there are.
[331:52.35]There's so many different innovative new Reese's and they're actually pretty good.
[331:54.79]Are there?
[331:55.41]I've never seen one.
[331:56.77]Think of all the innovations that have happened in Reese's.
[332:00.33]Like what?
[332:01.93]Peanut butter?
[332:02.67]Reese's pretzel.
[332:03.84]That's a big skeleton.
[332:05.42]Reese's thins.
[332:07.76]That is a huge skeleton.
[332:09.90]Let me see if he's paying attention.
[332:13.04]Hey.
[332:14.42]Hey, who did that?
[332:18.77]Okay, how come he doesn't lag the whole game, but the birds do?
[332:24.15]We need to get out of here.
[332:28.12]Who fucking hit him?
[332:30.80]I don't think we fight this.
[332:31.96]I think we just go.
[332:42.55]Just one little bone on the tree branch.
[332:46.96]Let's go.
[332:52.08]Do you know what else is really interesting about Elden Ring lore?
[332:54.06]Never hear anyone talk about this.
[332:55.32]Sure.
[332:56.24]A lot of people pronounce the word three.
[332:58.61]They can't speak English.
[332:59.57]They say tree.
[333:01.35]So anything that's interesting about the tree fingers and how important the Erdtree is.
[333:12.07]Where did you go?
[333:12.81]Say that again.
[333:13.53]I just... You say... What?
[333:24.21]Tree?
[333:27.33]Don't worry about it.
[333:28.31]It's kind of above your pay grade.
[333:38.00]Okay, but what about Gideon?
[333:40.68]What about him?
[333:41.50]If Gideon said Three Fingers, he'd go, oh, you've probably seen the Three Fingers.
[333:46.41]What are you talking about?
[333:48.05]Well, not everyone pronounces it that way.
[333:55.86]Like some say cause some say cause cause some say cause.
[334:00.38]Grant us eyes.
[334:02.26]Grant us eyes.
[334:03.22]Some people say three and some people say three.
[334:06.32]Like you once did for the vacuous rom.
[334:10.59]The all knowing armor.
[334:19.43]OK, we need to go through.
[334:20.46]Got him.
[334:26.32]I did so much damage.
[334:27.88]Why don't we just do the thing?
[334:28.78]Just drop down and kill him from the top.
[334:33.50]It's like the easiest way to kill these.
[334:36.12]Do it then.
[334:37.48]Can you like move him a little bit towards you?
[334:39.64]Like aggro him over.
[334:40.59]Hey, did you know if you hit the top of it?
[334:42.43]Yeah.
[334:45.13]Just pull him this way.
[334:46.69]I'll get him.
[334:47.53]I'm stuck on this ant.
[334:48.49]Why do you look like a half cooked hot dog?
[334:51.07]Um, I don't know, bro.
[334:52.70]Fucking fuck off.
[334:55.28]Whoa.
[335:05.13]I got him.
[335:06.76]Oh, I'm doing so much damage.
[335:11.58]Hey, hey, hey, group up.
[335:13.18]Guilty.
[335:13.78]Guilty.
[335:14.22]Group up.
[335:21.82]Good.
[335:22.38]Always got to make sure you can be prepared for anything.
[335:25.57]That means you're a pretty good healer.
[335:27.63]Yeah.
[335:30.85]Okay, so we got a... Is there another wall?
[335:33.45]Shadow Priest.
[335:35.20]There's another wall somewhere, right?
[335:36.62]There's gotta be another wall.
[335:37.70]There's always another wall.
[336:02.34]Watch out!
[336:04.14]Slugman!
[336:12.35]Oh, isn't this where the big asshole thing is?
[336:17.57]Isn't this the well in Dark Souls 2?
[336:24.59]No, I would make this more aligned with the big tree in Dark Souls 1.
[336:32.01]the big tree the tree what's it called yeah no great the great something great the big tree yeah I missed that area no you didn't I've like watched you play it I act the the like the like secret tree area that's like it's not even secret way off to the side I I played and saw Dark Souls one so many times before I realized that area existed I'm like I'm telling you I'm a fraud
[336:59.78]I think you just want to beat stuff so quickly that you just don't care if you miss something.
[337:04.94]No, it's not.
[337:06.04]You're misrepresenting me right now.
[337:08.93]I could take you to court.
[337:09.75]Yeah, but what would you sue me for?
[337:15.47]Defamation.
[337:15.97]Okay.
[337:23.62]Watch out.
[337:23.96]Big guy in here.
[337:26.43]This is the... Isn't this the right... This is the same... This is the correct enemy that's supposed to be in here.
[337:31.73]Is it?
[337:32.93]I think so.
[337:37.85]I'm pretty sure this is what's actually in here.
[337:54.25]I thought he was going to kill me with one hit.
[338:00.73]He's got so much lighting on him.
[338:01.95]It's hard to see where he is.
[338:15.48]Nice.
[338:18.50]I got the Glaive of Gilgamesh.
[338:20.02]I got the Seedbed Curse.
[338:23.08]Stay away from me.
[338:24.94]I got a Remembrance, actually.
[338:26.64]Did you really?
[338:27.02]That's good.
[338:28.02]You know, the Omen King.
[338:31.24]You know him?
[338:32.02]You know who that is?
[338:32.54]The Omen King?
[338:35.32]Uh, is that Mohg?
[338:37.46]Or is that Morgott?
[338:41.22]You really, you need to go watch three more hours of videos.
[338:45.65]I believe you're talking about Morgott.
[338:49.07]I feel like I'm hitting you with lore that you never even considered before.
[338:52.29]And you're just, you don't even remember like anything.
[338:54.55]No, I'm telling you, I was obsessed with all this game's lore, everything about it.
[339:00.08]I just loved every second of it.
[339:05.50]You got me wrong.
[339:07.62]And you never even considered it was the tree fingers.
[339:12.87]Okay.
[339:16.48]Just go get Double Tish and kill Millenia.
[339:19.14]Is that enough to level up?
[339:32.39]Fuck.
[339:32.63]Okay, well this one doesn't open yet.
[339:36.87]Alright, so that's how we get to here.
[339:43.42]This thing doesn't open yet.
[339:45.71]We can't get into the capital.
[339:49.60]We can't... We have to beat Malenia.
[339:56.24]We have to... I mean, I guess... I think we kind of have to just... I think we have to kill Malenia.
[340:06.77]I think we gotta kill Malenia.
[340:08.55]Unless we just did random catacombs and stuff.
[340:11.11]To try to find a rune.
[340:13.46]uh what's um you know the upside down tower of ronnie's quest thing thing yeah I I have the device you want to go we kept saying we have all the ronnie and the finger blade alright I'm mark to ronnie yeah or ranala or remi alright what does she want me to call her uh let's go to ronnie's rise yeah
[340:41.31]is she even there do we have to talk to servetus man um I don't does she move she goes to sleep forever and she's just totally just like this part of the game's boring wake me up when it's over I don't know yeah
[341:09.57]Can we do that funny thing that we did before where we picture our voice down one tiny notch?
[341:15.21]Keep it on permanently until people just leave?
[341:17.77]Yeah, sounds pretty good.
[341:20.47]Okay.
[341:24.99]I think you're pitched a little bit too... A little too low?
[341:28.79]A little higher than that.
[341:31.79]A little higher?
[341:32.75]No, lower.
[341:33.35]I mean, then it's not on at all.
[341:42.80]Okay, so I can do something.
[341:46.12]Wait, no, I don't want to do that.
[341:48.98]I almost just ruined our whole playthrough.
[341:51.10]Did you just hit her in the head with a sword?
[341:52.70]No, I almost just did the weird quest thingy.
[341:56.64]Isn't that administer drought?
[342:00.57]What is that?
[342:03.29]You give her a fucking poison?
[342:04.71]Yeah, I think I could kill her or something.
[342:07.51]Okay, I'm not going over there.
[342:13.64]OK, she, uh.
[342:15.77]Do we get on stairs and blade is like you took my waifu and we kill him?
[342:18.45]I think it happens later.
[342:21.89]I think it happens after you burn the tree.
[342:45.70]Can we get your best wolf snarl?
[342:48.42]That was a bird, but it was a decent attempt.
[342:59.85]Alright, what did she say?
[343:02.79]She says she also has to go on a journey.
[343:05.57]I think she gives you the doll.
[343:06.87]I think we got to go talk to the other tower guy.
[343:08.91]Don't we have to talk to the doll at a certain place underground somewhere?
[343:13.95]uh yeah the other like nocturne dude this quest is so what do we have to do for like why are we doing this why did I bring this up again we're trying to get a rune tried to engage in my interest I was just he likes pretending to be like a wolf what if I give him like an easy one
[343:44.85]It's probably the wrong one.
[343:46.57]There's another one, right?
[343:47.59]Or is it?
[343:49.23]There is a third tower.
[343:51.57]This is the three tower sisters.
[343:56.90]Oh, like the Three Fingers.
[343:58.40]Remember?
[343:59.98]Yeah, I do.

[348:39.60]Well, now what?
[348:42.40]Reload the area.
[348:43.48]I'm talking to pity.
[348:44.56]We don't got to kill the dragon.
[348:46.25]Did you go down here?
[348:51.61]I did.
[348:59.90]I minimap is my map is wrong man.
[349:09.51]I think you're inside here.
[349:10.95]We can just teleport somewhere.
[349:12.05]I just wanted to see what he was selling.
[349:20.55]Why are you doing that?
[349:22.27]No.
[349:25.55]I ate this weird raw pork chop.
[349:28.21]I heated up.
[349:29.59]I was there for like 16 hours.
[349:31.75]Oh, ha ha ha.
[349:32.87]I figured it would be alright.
[349:34.51]Living my life story now.
[349:37.47]Alright.
[349:37.71]We need to go somewhere and we need to figure out we need to get another rune or we need to actually just go.
[349:42.50]Let's go kill.
[349:43.10]Let's go.
[349:43.44]Millennium.
[349:44.06]Let's go.
[349:45.08]Let's do it.
[349:46.16]He said, let's go.
[349:48.52]Millennium.
[349:49.12]Let's do it.
[349:49.74]Millennium.
[349:52.03]Where's the right bonfire?
[349:53.35]Let's go get Millenia.
[349:55.75]Where's Pitya?
[349:56.29]Am I in the right spot for Pitya?
[350:01.04]I think I was just kind of jumping around.
[350:03.18]No, you got to like fall off the edge.
[350:05.42]There's like a castle.
[350:07.70]Yeah.
[350:08.00]Somebody behind you.
[350:10.23]Behind.
[350:11.27]Here he is right here.
[350:12.39]I know there's items.
[350:14.59]Behind.
[350:15.37]One of these could be a great run.
[350:16.57]Behind.
[350:16.71]Behind.
[350:25.22]I never found this person really no wow what a loser you are I thought you played this game yeah how's it feel pretty good
[351:02.47]Dude, I've never been down here.
[351:06.77]Holy shit.
[351:12.11]Cool.
[351:14.43]Alright.
[351:15.01]Are you ready to fight Malenia and have us both rage quit the stream in about 30 minutes?
[351:21.12]I say that we... For the prediction, I think we could do it in like 60 tries.
[351:28.76]Hmm.
[351:32.01]Do you have any runes?
[351:34.13]Yeah, I need 4000.
[351:39.39]Hey you, your runes.
[351:42.07]Give them to me.
[351:45.24]It's kind of just like gold farming.
[352:03.37]You should be, you should pretend to be mad at Ster.
[352:09.16]He'll hear.
[352:11.80]He doesn't pretend.
[352:17.28]Alright.
[352:18.14]You ready to just kind of bang our heads against the wall for a little bit?
[352:23.97]Okay.
[352:25.89]If we do it, we just, I think we've been playing for a while.
[352:29.27]We warmed up a lot.
[352:30.09]I mean, this was six hours in.
[352:31.69]If we're going to do it, we're going to do it right now.
[352:33.43]I actually know how to dodge now.
[352:35.56]Alright, so where is the good place to go to?
[352:37.40]Hey, bro, did you forget the whole game too?
[352:48.26]Nice.
[352:48.78]Yep.
[352:48.94]I don't know.
[352:53.23]I feel like it's one of these.
[353:07.40]Yes, Tal.
[353:23.49]Will they beat Malenia in 10 tries?
[353:26.25]Hmm.
[353:33.21]That's possible, I wonder.
[353:36.59]We'll see.
[353:42.30]Let me make sure I got the right gear on.
[353:43.68]Malenia is slash, right?
[353:53.36]I believe law of regression heals all ailments that should get rid of scarlet rot.
[353:57.80]In case we get in a bad pickle.
[354:15.15]This is all going to be heavy.
[354:15.93]Alright.
[354:27.48]Alright.
[354:27.76]So points are in.
[354:29.06]We have 10 real attempts.
[354:34.04]You ready?
[354:35.08]Yep.
[354:35.67]Alright.
[354:37.27]I'm going to win this fight.
[354:41.79]Let's go soldiers for the guild.
[354:45.83]We've been trying to clear this raid for a month.
[354:48.74]All the big guilds have already done it.
[354:53.06]We're the last ones.
[354:54.58]We're not trying to get world first or anything.
[354:56.06]We're just trying to just participate.
[355:00.34]They're out gearing us.
[355:03.96]Which is making them... They're getting more loot in the Chinese New Year event.
[355:12.70]They spent plenty of time developing.
[355:16.34]Just to get dropped from China.
[355:18.32]Alright.
[355:18.58]Alright.
[355:18.88]Alright.
[355:19.22]Are you ready?
[355:19.54]Alright.
[355:27.42]Wait.
[355:31.38]Waiting.
[355:38.28]Let's go.
[355:55.63]I'm hitting her.
[355:56.99]Yes, you are.
[355:58.15]Every time I jump, she dodges.
[356:05.82]I fucking, I neo-brained for a second.
[356:07.78]I'm stuck in a fucking lamppost!
[356:16.24]I like Glintstone Pebble better here.
[356:21.47]It can go up anytime.
[356:26.65]Yeah.
[356:28.51]Oh!
[356:34.94]Excellent.
[356:35.76]Good job.
[356:36.74]Excellent.
[356:48.91]My fucking button clicked in.
[356:50.81]This stupid button.
[356:52.35]The button clicked in and it's a crouch.
[356:57.28]Literally the worst place for a fucking crouch.
[357:03.27]I...
[357:22.13]Left stick push in is crouch.
[357:23.77]Do you know how much people grip this fucking game?
[357:26.27]And they like, you know how many times that happens?
[357:35.26]Just trying some stuff, seeing how it goes.
[357:38.70]Learning.
[357:40.02]Didn't you rebind it?
[357:40.86]Oh yeah, there's a whole nother game client.
[357:46.31]This is not the original game client.
[357:53.97]Hold on, I gotta go unbind crouch to left stick.
[358:04.10]Do you ever have that problem?
[358:07.28]No.
[358:08.18]Where, like, you're pushing down on, like, running around and you click in the left stick because you're pushing down hard?
[358:14.43]And this bullshit happens?
[358:18.37]Never done it.
[358:18.91]I've been there.
[358:19.37]Somebody says it.
[358:21.13]I believe that it's a thing.
[358:23.42]And what these controllers really need is a mind detector.
[358:30.81]If we could just get a little bit closer to the user's intent.
[358:34.35]Hold on a second.
[358:35.29]This is all fucked up.
[358:38.91]Okay, that's better.
[358:40.53]I feel like switching to faith was a meme.
[358:43.41]Okay, I'm better.
[358:49.30]And I am objectively worse than our last fight.
[358:52.82]I don't think so.
[358:53.36]I think we're okay.
[358:53.94]We were doing pretty well until I pressed the fucking left stick in.
[359:08.63]You know, it kind of reminds me of when hitting a light attack and forward was kick in some of the other games.
[359:19.65]Yeah, I did that quite a bit.
[359:33.26]In my personal opinion, get anything bound off of the movement button.
[359:42.64]Okay, that one was a good attempt.
[359:44.96]Yeah, we're good.
[359:45.66]A little bit of a controller issue.
[359:47.50]Didn't count.
[360:00.77]Oh, you would just go for the caster.
[360:04.37]That was my bad.
[360:05.41]I didn't even realize that at first that she changed targets.
[360:07.90]That was not a good attempt.
[360:09.46]Sorry.
[360:11.86]Dude, like Glintstone Pebble.
[360:14.96]It's the best spell in the game.
[360:19.71]What are you using now?
[360:21.41]Now I got like lightning bolt and she can actually dodge it because it doesn't track at all.
[360:26.25]So Glintstone Pebble is gone?
[360:29.19]Well, I'm faith skilled now.
[360:33.68]Hmm.
[360:34.87]I distinctly remember us having an argument about this very subject.
[360:38.57]Did we?
[360:39.87]Edgar Allan Poe?
[360:41.31]I distinctly remember us squabbling over this very, very subject.
[360:50.95]He's disassociating.
[360:52.20]So he doesn't have to fight Valeria.
[361:03.06]He thinks he's in a play.
[361:07.59]Maybe it'll help.
[361:11.81]Did we?
[361:12.22]I don't remember talking about it.
[361:14.74]Here I am.
[361:15.38]It me.
[361:18.12]Let us go up the elevator.
[361:24.81]Brother, there's an arrow in your back.
[361:38.53]Hello, Millennium.
[361:40.61]I'm here.
[361:49.28]Excellent first maneuver.
[361:51.74]Although I seem to have dodged quite a few of them.
[362:06.12]Pressing the attack, I see.
[362:12.50]That I didn't see.
[362:17.06]Yeah.
[362:20.55]Yeah, you did.
[362:25.07]Yeah, it also did more damage.
[362:29.55]But what that buffered so hard.
[362:46.19]We do so much less damage now because she's scaling.
[362:53.06]No.
[362:53.34]Is that what it is?
[362:55.40]No, she's scaled to the room that she's in.
[362:58.83]I'm just saying that my lightning deals less damage than my glintstone pebble did, and it's harder to hit her with it.
[363:06.13]She's going to dodge it every time.
[363:12.23]Unless she's a big dum-dum.
[363:18.92]Let her get me.
[363:25.03]She's scaled to have lower health, if anything.
[363:37.15]Phase 2 is... Phase 1 is giving us some trouble already.
[363:41.63]Phase 2 is going to be such a pain in the ass.
[363:47.63]I think I'm bad.
[363:49.53]And I've got 100 fizz mitigation shield.
[363:52.15]It was letting me just live through the flurry.
[363:56.17]Maybe I should put one on too.
[363:59.80]I figure even if she hurts me and she does heal from hitting you, but as long as I don't fucking insta-die.
[364:07.25]I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna sword.
[364:08.57]No magic.
[364:09.49]I can use my greater heels.
[364:10.75]Actually, let me go back.
[364:12.11]Oh, you already jumped.
[364:12.89]I mean, I thought, I thought I was holding you up.
[364:16.54]I have a few magic blasts.
[364:18.00]And you know what?
[364:18.68]You know what?
[364:18.98]Let's, yeah, let's just reset it.
[364:20.34]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[364:22.26]Okay, yeah, let's just like.
[364:23.40]No, just reset it.
[364:24.02]Let's just reset.
[364:25.26]Reset it.
[364:25.86]I gotta move some gear around.
[364:27.14]That doesn't count.
[364:29.24]That doesn't, that's not a real attempt.
[364:33.26]Yeah, our reset doesn't count.
[364:34.63]That's not fair.
[364:38.26]We have to traverse the fog door for it to be a real attempt.
[364:42.28]I called it before I jumped down.
[364:44.03]You sour boys.
[364:46.47]Because I have three fucking mana flasks I don't need.
[364:54.76]How much?
[364:56.00]How heavy is it?
[364:57.58]It's way too heavy.
[365:14.98]I think I just had to be good.
[365:19.04]Okay, you ready?
[365:19.78]I love how many weapons you've like considered using and how much stuff you've done.
[365:30.05]And I'm seriously still like... How are we... This happened to us.
[365:35.04]I don't know.
[365:35.42]That did a lot of damage.
[365:37.20]Here, I'll use... I have the healing still equipped I can use before the door.
[365:44.93]Yeah, don't heal yourself.
[365:48.33]I think the dog is right behind us.
[365:52.39]Thank God.
[365:58.78]Did that not get you?
[365:59.54]I think it did.
[366:01.70]I can't tell.
[366:05.06]Dead.
[366:07.96]The other one was Lord's heal.
[366:14.04]Lord sworn.
[366:18.64]Okay.
[366:25.34]Okay.
[366:28.18]No disrespect to the battle mercies out there, but really, let's go balls out.
[366:34.81]Don't waste all your stamina bar.
[366:36.59]You can go up at any time.
[366:40.67]Let's go.
[366:49.07]I fucking I'm
[367:26.30]What?
[367:27.08]What was that?
[367:27.78]Dude, that, okay.
[367:37.89]Somebody help me.
[367:38.59]That, like, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.
[367:40.63]Like, how do you, do you dodge through it or to the right?
[367:43.53]How do I do that?
[367:46.67]That, like, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
[367:48.99]So if you dodge forward to the right or forward?
[367:55.44]It's in and then to the right.
[367:57.28]So it's forward, right.
[367:59.94]Right and then back?
[368:02.00]I think it's in.
[368:02.94]Yeah, it's in and to the right.
[368:13.93]You go, wait.
[368:16.57]I just saw you kicking up a little, a little flame there.
[368:20.67]It looks like you were doing, are you going for some parries here?
[368:27.50]Are you alive?
[368:29.65]Yeah.
[368:34.69]I don't know.
[368:35.45]I forget like what she does that you can parry.
[368:40.68]And then you still have to parry her three times.
[368:55.77]You can parry waterfowl.
[368:57.79]Good luck.
[369:02.11]Did you actually just do that much damage to me?
[369:05.07]We're just trying to get by, man.
[369:07.01]We're just trying to get by.
[369:26.64]Not hurting her.
[369:32.73]My game is being real weird.
[369:44.97]She could do it.
[369:47.01]Be aware.
[369:51.76]I'm so paranoid.
[369:52.58]Yep.
[369:58.74]easy easy dude no damage dude what really jumping
[370:34.79]Watch that she could go up
[371:11.83]Damn it!
[371:12.77]Damn it!
[371:13.41]I'm fine!
[371:13.79]You're good, you're good, you're good.
[371:15.81]Shoot!
[371:28.54]Where's the stagger?
[371:48.26]alright oh what the what the we're good watch that rot just being extra careful she's on me
[372:15.73]The fuck is my character doing?
[372:21.87]Dude, seriously?
[372:25.29]She grabbed me from fucking behind again.
[372:31.59]She was going for you and she fucking grabbed me.
[372:38.73]I rolled like into it.
[372:40.17]It's just there's so much shit happening on the fucking screen.
[372:49.46]I just forget that she even has that fucking move.
[372:52.26]This character sucks.
[372:58.71]She heals when you block, by the way, apparently.
[373:00.45]Yeah, I know.
[373:03.30]She kills you when you don't, dude.
[373:21.65]I told you, my normal playthrough, I killed her with Mimic Tear and the whole time my shot was like, dude, she heals when she hits the Mimic Tear.
[373:27.73]And I just fucking just kept jumping on her until she died.
[373:31.53]Sometimes you gotta take the L to get the dub.
[373:34.02]I beat her with Tish.
[373:35.22]I just let Tish fight her.
[373:36.20]I was like, I don't even care.
[373:45.88]You saved Ster.
[373:47.15]That was literally a get down, Mr. President.
[374:00.85]Oh my God, dude.
[374:03.41]I can't.
[374:03.87]I can't.
[374:04.45]I'm stuck.
[374:04.93]I'm stuck.
[374:05.65]I can't.
[374:06.35]I can't.
[374:06.79]Anakin.
[374:07.41]Anakin, I'm too weak.
[374:08.77]I can't.
[374:22.51]Alright.
[374:24.23]Dude, are we ever going to be able to do this?
[374:26.01]Yeah.
[374:27.69]I mean, we're good until you got one shot by a grab.
[374:30.82]Hey, but I stopped you from getting one shot by the grab.
[374:34.78]I don't think it looked like that on my screen.
[374:37.86]I don't feel like I was in danger.
[374:44.78]Maybe I'm wrong.
[374:45.40]Do you need a great heal?
[374:46.56]Oh, no, you're in there.
[374:47.38]Okay.
[374:47.70]I mean, we're either going to do it or we're not.
[374:49.67]I don't think the extra 20%, 15% health is going to be a problem.
[374:54.61]I mean, if you had a little bit more health last time.
[374:58.05]I mean, dude, it was like almost 100%.
[374:59.51]And a heal.
[375:23.38]Yeah, I'm going to start hitting her right away.
[375:26.63]And she's probably going to go up in the air.
[375:30.58]Yep.
[375:34.74]Oh, Jesus.
[375:36.06]She went to you.
[375:37.16]I'm good.
[375:43.80]Afraid that she's going to do it.
[375:58.79]That was a weird jump.
[376:10.72]Oh, come on!
[376:22.55]Come on, we gotta do this to the fucking guild.
[376:26.97]You know what?
[376:28.47]I think fighting together makes it harder because it's almost like she's going after you, but I get hit by her hitbox sometimes.
[376:40.66]Oh, I was wondering why I wasn't healing.
[376:42.48]I was pressing the Neo Heal button for like the last 20 seconds.
[376:58.40]Now Jerm is blaming me.
[376:59.82]What?
[377:00.62]It is kind of fucked up that you're blaming me.
[377:01.98]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[377:02.90]Don't let chat tell you something that didn't happen.
[377:05.64]I just said that it's almost like fighting her solo would be easier.
[377:10.21]so do you want to you want to take turns no I feel like that is saying that I'm it's my fault no no I'm just saying that that I by my presence is making it harder for you he's dragging you down dude
[377:32.14]I mean, I'll let you go in solo for a bit.
[377:35.90]Alright.
[377:37.06]Let me go in in solo, and I will tell you if I need your help, okay?
[377:41.60]And then you can come in full health and shit.
[377:44.40]Wait a minute, this could be genius.
[377:48.50]If you need me, but you won't need me.
[377:50.00]Alright, so if I need you, I'm gonna call you in.
[377:52.78]You're gonna be full health, refreshed.
[377:55.18]Yeah.
[377:55.98]Alright.
[377:57.12]I'm just gonna be in the locker room.
[378:03.48]Alright.
[378:06.75]I'm going in.
[378:08.67]Okay.
[378:44.96]the forces of diablo grow stronger so
[379:12.29]Hey, I was in just a bad spot for it.
[379:16.91]Yes, come on in, dude.
[379:19.27]Yeah, I got this.
[379:21.81]I was just in a bad spot.
[379:22.79]Good luck.
[379:23.48]Let's try it.
[379:29.50]Dude, I got to get a shield on.
[379:31.54]Just block the first one, roll the next one.
[379:33.46]She's an idiot.
[379:34.98]Who cares if she heals a little bit?
[379:36.53]Chats can always be like, oh, she's fine.
[379:38.25]Did you know she's healing?
[379:41.47]yeah chat why is she oh okay I mean I don't think I I'm gonna do the whole fight like solo though
[379:54.90]uh dude I think it's time we just bring in two oh mega spirit summons and just who gives a shit let's get let's get out of here and you're giving up I don't why do you want to fight Malenia this fight sucks absolute balls like you don't who wants to play this nobody wants to fight this character let's get the summons and get rid of this motherfucker but she heals off the summons
[380:29.78]Alright, not until the bed.
[380:30.78]That's fine.
[380:32.48]And no more screaming.
[380:33.30]I'm not a scream streamer.
[380:35.70]Like, YouTuber.
[380:36.48]Come on.
[380:37.32]Settle down.
[380:42.70]I have a strategy.
[380:45.19]What if we, like... What if we, like, both fight her?
[380:49.25]Yeah, that works.
[380:54.78]That way we can try and keep her staggered for longer.
[380:58.00]If, like, both of us are hitting her.
[380:59.84]I mean, I'm just saying, you give me the go-ahead.
[381:01.64]I'm going back to the Spirit Summon trainer.
[381:04.76]And I'm just going to get Tish to, like, plus 8.
[381:07.38]Who is Tish?
[381:08.38]Tish is probably the best summon in the game.
[381:11.95]It's just such a good... She's so good at everything.
[381:15.77]And she literally killed Malenia by herself.
[381:19.09]I didn't even do anything when I played it.
[381:25.89]okay let's let's just try both like to see what happens if we both fight her which we've never done before I'll go in first usually you go in first and like curse it it's true I don't have a fucking spirit bell
[382:01.34]You're playing around with your fucking bell.
[382:02.56]I thought we were doing this together.
[382:04.06]I actually thought we were doing this together and we would stagger her and you wouldn't miss every swing.
[382:08.08]I didn't even get... Dude, you went up there and just fucking died.
[382:11.01]You went up there and died, dude.
[382:12.55]I didn't even... Because you're trying to look in your fucking back pocket for Queen Latifah or whatever.
[382:23.89]Let me out of here.
[382:24.71]Let me out, please.
[382:26.15]Somebody please let me out.
[382:37.90]Just fucking kidding.
[382:41.60]Oh, the fight begins.
[382:42.68]Oh, I feel so alive.
[382:47.46]Jeremy, what you don't understand is it's a dance.
[382:58.93]It's a dance.
[382:59.77]Dude, not even Redon could beat her.
[383:26.38]It's a dance.
[383:29.83]Yeah.
[383:32.45]How come I don't have a spirit bell?
[383:35.96]Because it's an item you gotta get.
[383:38.15]Do you have a spirit bell?
[383:39.33]How did I not get it?
[383:43.29]I mean... Oh, it's just random.
[383:45.95]That sucks.
[383:48.35]I think it probably counts as a key item and you could probably get it from somewhere.
[383:51.19]Hold on.
[383:51.73]Are we sure that I don't have it?
[383:54.42]Wait, wait, wait.
[383:54.86]I have that rot thing on.
[383:58.42]Why do I have... We both died.
[383:59.56]Why do I have the rot thing?
[384:05.54]That's weird.
[384:05.96]I just don't have enough mana.
[384:16.09]That's probably not going to happen.
[384:18.99]Just don't die to her like spaghetti.
[384:25.34]OK, come on, Ralphie.
[384:27.60]That's fucked up.
[385:12.33]Hehehehehehe!
[385:19.97]Um, where are... Um, I'm going up.
[385:23.09]You blocked me!
[385:25.13]Wait, I can't get it back!
[385:26.61]Hold on.
[385:28.69]Hey, you know what?
[385:29.15]Just reset.
[385:29.85]Reset.
[385:30.09]We gotta... No, go in, go in, go in, go in.
[385:31.75]I'm in.
[385:33.14]Is this guy coming in too?
[385:34.96]Here, I got a spell.
[385:36.94]Let me use my spell.
[385:44.44]Oh...
[385:47.50]So fresh.
[385:48.60]One more.
[385:49.56]One more.
[385:56.65]You beat this game.
[385:57.35]How are you so bad?
[386:00.58]Dude.
[386:01.56]I'm not even going to respond to that one.
[386:10.93]Real fight, real focus.
[386:12.57]If you lose this, Otto gets it.
[386:14.53]I'm going in.
[386:16.47]I'm in.
[386:16.79]I'm already in.
[386:17.31]Where are you?
[386:17.69]Okay.
[387:12.13]If she's she doing some jumps
[387:18.29]Come on in.
[387:46.50]time you go to attack he moves the other player easy
[388:14.03]Yeah, she is kind of easy, huh?
[388:16.81]It's very, actually very hard.
[388:18.83]Where were you looking?
[388:21.10]I'm alright, but that was very annoying.
[388:23.70]I'm incredibly annoyed by it.
[388:52.12]Okay, hold on.
[388:59.84]Okay.
[389:21.02]Oh, that's... I don't know what the fuck she's doing.
[389:24.22]I don't know what she's doing.
[389:27.23]Dude, what is she doing?
[389:28.47]What is she doing?
[389:29.59]I saved you.
[389:31.01]She's...
[389:51.60]little bro doesn't even have his controller plugged in what are you talking about talking about me man my last heal besides slow heal damn she really sick with it
[390:28.49]I gotta save him!
[390:29.15]This is the weird ghost shit!
[390:44.40]I'm dead.
[390:46.80]I'm lightheaded.
[390:50.84]Dude, I'm going out.
[390:51.76]I'm going out.
[390:53.46]I expelled all the air out of my body.
[390:56.51]I saw stars for one second.
[391:10.31]It's so hard.
[391:11.19]Best one yet.
[391:14.61]That was pretty good.
[391:20.45]Try your L2.
[391:21.55]It takes so long.
[391:22.57]It's not worth it.
[391:25.56]That was a good attempt.
[391:31.00]So the ghost move, I somehow dodged every single one.
[391:34.40]I don't even know how I did it.
[391:35.83]She attacked me with every single one.
[391:37.27]It's just the pillars were in the way and I had no idea when she was casting it.
[391:39.93]You were in the flow state.
[391:41.97]You hit trance.
[391:44.53]You know what I'm saying?
[391:47.06]I thought we had it there.
[391:48.79]I know what you're thinking, but it's probably, whatever.
[391:51.95]You're trying to, you say skip the ladder altogether.
[391:53.47]Yeah.
[391:56.28]Actually, probably a good idea.
[392:02.20]I'm on.
[392:07.43]I do have the boiled crabs.
[392:08.95]I feel like it's time to... We gotta use these.
[392:11.75]We picked up... I used one that fight.
[392:14.01]We picked up so much random shit.
[392:15.87]Like it's... I can't even remember.
[392:18.94]I guess I'll put them on the bar.
[392:19.92]Uh... Okay.
[392:33.32]I tried to hit b to back out of the menu and you saw what happened next yeah you know naturally that's naturally that's how it happens you just you know you're pressing b
[393:02.53]Can I get one of those heals when I get back up?
[393:06.22]Sure.
[393:06.56]Alright, let me actually put them on the bar.
[393:15.72]Because I'll use them.
[393:21.17]Can I eat them both at the same time?
[393:23.43]Okay.
[393:30.19]Okay.
[393:35.38]I have been using my wondrous disease.
[393:37.30]I have another one.
[393:56.59]I was going to go as long as it took.
[394:00.19]Do you want some crabs and whatever these are?
[394:03.07]Do you want some?
[394:04.23]I don't think I need them.
[394:05.55]I already had, you know, the whole eating, you know.
[394:10.00]Are they raw?
[394:11.46]No, they're boiled.
[394:12.40]Let's go.
[394:12.96]I don't want them.
[394:18.78]Malenia!
[394:20.87]It's time for you to pay!
[394:43.65]that was unfortunate but my game was lagging so bad during that I was worried
[395:11.64]Oh my god.
[395:14.96]Thank you.
[395:16.14]That might have just saved me.
[395:17.60]I was just so... I was so desperately trying to make it so you... Alright, I don't want to die here.
[395:23.97]Okay.
[395:24.29]I'm coming.
[395:25.53]Oh god.
[395:27.43]She turned around to do it to you.
[395:32.21]It's fine.
[395:36.41]I need a second.
[395:37.03]I'm not with you.
[395:38.38]Alright.
[395:39.02]Be aware of that.
[395:50.89]Oh, fuck.
[396:05.48]Nice one.
[396:07.18]Get in the corner!
[396:17.20]Get in the corner!
[396:22.69]She went down.
[396:27.82]Get her.
[396:28.62]Okay.
[396:28.92]Alright.
[396:29.16]Alright.
[396:29.50]Heal up.
[396:30.62]Heal up and get ready.
[396:31.58]Heal up and get ready.
[396:37.53]What?
[396:41.63]Wait.
[396:42.27]She needs one hit.
[396:46.03]Is she?
[396:47.45]Yes.
[396:50.96]okay uh I don't have any mana for repeal what the heck I dodged it quiet let's show her why we're the actual rot boys
[397:18.44]I'm covered in rot.
[397:19.30]I'm covered in rot.
[397:20.00]It's bad.
[397:21.12]It's real bad.
[397:22.20]Alright.
[397:45.02]I'm just eating food over here I'm buying time for you alright let's go so
[398:13.74]I would expect the shadows yep she's chasing you hard here she goes you just run far enough away it won't get you I don't think that's accurate though I can't see where am I yeah same
[398:54.33]Oh, she's doing this bullshit again She should pull heel during that
[399:20.61]Oh, no!
[399:21.53]I didn't know that's what she was doing.
[399:22.77]I thought she was going towards you with the... Oh, man.
[399:25.75]I didn't know she was doing that.
[399:27.91]Fuck.
[399:29.39]I thought she was doing the thing where she puts the sword in the ground and does the explosion.
[399:35.38]Well, good luck.
[399:39.82]Whoa.
[399:40.90]Whoa, what the fuck was...
[399:54.96]That's what I thought she was doing.
[399:56.79]Always assume it's Waterfowl.
[399:58.09]I also... She was aiming at Ster.
[400:00.29]Figured I could get in there.
[400:01.11]I got no more heals.
[400:04.93]This is it.
[400:06.05]I got one more.
[400:06.77]This is rough.
[400:11.38]She's just healed.
[400:13.30]I've goofed.
[400:30.39]The L2 is insane damage.
[400:32.39]Yeah, I just I did it once and I must have pressed it again because I did the second part and I really didn't want to.
[400:37.91]And that's where it kind of fell apart for me.
[400:57.16]That was a really good attempt, though, it's unfortunate.
[401:02.31]yeah I wish I had like any other weapon for this I have a dagger that reduces max HP what do you mean didn't you have some like fully upgraded faith sword wait I'm not even faith never mind what is this what do you mean
[401:33.73]Did I use this?
[401:38.85]Is this good?
[401:51.14]With no upgrades?
[401:52.08]No.
[402:04.76]This is just going to have to come down to us being gamers, I think.
[402:12.64]Is it a debuff?
[402:13.28]I mean, there's no harm in me keeping it on.
[402:15.36]I could try it.
[402:16.42]See what it does.
[402:18.68]I'll try it.
[402:23.64]I went the wrong way.
[402:24.26]Alright.
[402:26.02]I will tell you, I'm getting a little bit of gamer fatigue.
[402:29.22]A little bit of gamer fatigue.
[402:30.32]I'm getting a little bit of gamer fatigue.
[402:32.42]And that's understandable.
[402:33.52]That was just unfortunate what just happened.
[402:35.48]I mean, it's fine because we're going to win this one.
[402:47.30]Make sure that guy with the spear on the stairs...
[402:49.88]Can you please just, like, walk a little bit further?
[402:53.16]I did.
[402:55.04]I did.
[402:55.52]There's fucking worms in you.
[402:57.09]Dude, you are gamer fatigued.
[403:10.53]Wait, that's not you.
[403:13.20]What?
[403:14.22]What the fuck?
[403:16.86]I was doing a thing where I was going to come back down and bow to you.
[403:22.20]Oh, this too, right.
[403:24.48]Wow, that's a big heal.
[403:26.86]Why is that so bad?
[403:32.99]How much faith do you have?
[403:34.25]I have the arcane scaling.
[403:38.31]Oh.
[403:40.91]I was told that that would work.
[403:51.22]arcane doesn't enhance faith incantations okay well I feel like I was asking a lot of a lot of people said yes okay let's see what happens here holy shit um excuse me you wait a minute you mean to tell me I could just sit back and just do that
[404:25.30]Oh, you got like the Moog sword?
[404:28.30]It's just doing this weird like dot.
[404:30.02]How long does it last?
[404:36.33]Holy shit, that thing is fucking disgusting.
[404:40.00]OK, well, I didn't.
[404:40.58]That's cool.
[404:41.82]Cool weapon.
[404:52.75]She might go sicko mode soon.
[404:53.95]I would expect it.
[405:12.16]Give her her space.
[405:13.52]She needs her space.
[405:22.21]Holy shit.
[405:31.96]I expect it like right now.
[405:33.07]I can't believe she doesn't know it.
[405:55.37]Oh my god!
[406:11.85]What chat doesn't understand is that she's also god-skinned.
[406:14.37]Alright, here she comes.
[406:16.37]Oh my fucking god!
[406:17.23]Oh, okay.
[406:21.67]That's, um... That's a full sprint.
[406:46.58]Damn it.
[406:47.34]Fuck.
[406:48.59]This sucks.
[406:49.45]This is so fucking hard.
[406:50.83]I remember hating this just as much as I did before on the regular game.
[406:54.39]Delete this.
[406:56.59]Delete this character from the game.
[406:58.31]Delete this character.
[406:59.17]I could upgrade the dagger.
[407:09.22]I really need to switch off Faith.
[407:11.62]It was a bad call.
[407:17.22]What does this scale with?
[407:21.72]Is this just Faith and Dex?
[407:23.20]Should I just go pump this up like crazy?
[407:41.23]How much Faith do you have?
[407:42.63]Because you have Arcane, don't you?
[407:44.18]I have like 50 Arcane.
[407:46.43]Yeah, so this wouldn't work with you.
[407:49.69]I'm going to go upgrade this thing.
[407:52.13]And I'm going to... You know what?
[407:54.59]Desperate times, desperate measures.
[407:56.65]Here's what we're doing.
[407:57.67]I'm going to take a shitload of mana potions.
[407:59.42]I'm going to go upgrade the knife.
[408:01.24]And I'm just going to be a coward dot loser.
[408:08.64]Okay, I'm going to go respec back to magic and get my glintstone pebble on it because it actually did damage.
[408:18.52]I need souls though.
[408:19.60]I could probably sell some shit.
[408:24.44]I also thought we picked up the, uh, like the blast ray, whatever.
[408:28.87]And I got excited, but I don't see it in my inventory.
[408:32.95]I don't know.
[408:41.33]Why do I have to fight this?
[408:42.59]OK, this is going to get tiring.
[408:45.27]Yeah, I'm getting the same thing.
[408:48.67]Oh, it's so spooky.
[408:58.37]OK.
[408:59.97]So.
[409:00.27]I wonder how much better it'll be when it's leveled up.
[409:17.17]Well, I took you for no matter.
[409:19.23]It's a way out your own.
[409:20.15]Shit.
[410:13.45]Alright.
[410:13.97]480.
[410:16.71]Oh, careful.
[410:40.35]doesn't upgrade the dot do not do this upgrading the dagger does not increase the dot come on Miyazaki why did everybody let me do this lay out your arms wait I told you the faith stuff scales wrong like afterwards I thought the l2 was gonna I feel like everybody was brick dude
[411:09.29]Maybe I'll use this weapon.
[411:12.21]Frick.
[411:20.25]Well, uh, never mind.
[411:22.27]I'm ready.
[411:27.27]The L2 will stunlock Malenia.
[411:29.56]That's true, but I can only do it a few times before I need to drink, and then I might just die.
[411:35.30]That's right.
[411:40.72]Oh, frick.
[411:42.78]Bleed is really strong against Malenia.
[411:44.46]Yeah.
[411:46.90]What is this weapon that I have?
[411:48.78]What is this thing?
[411:50.26]Is this bleed?
[411:52.74]Now it's fire.
[411:57.25]Do I have a bleed weapon?
[412:05.41]Put a bleed dagger in your other hand.
[412:11.14]I don't know if I even have one.
[412:15.46]Scarlet Rob.
[412:20.58]Um... This thing does... It's not too slow, though.
[412:27.83]This would be great.
[412:31.63]I could do a wheel... Respec.
[412:36.41]A real one?
[412:38.69]I'm gonna go Respec.
[412:45.93]How many of those tears do I have?
[412:48.29]Because this is a really dumb idea.
[412:49.88]I have one.
[413:03.24]I really thought I got the laser beam.
[413:06.62]I'm doing it.
[413:10.29]I'm going to have to live with what I do here.
[413:11.81]I'm doing it.
[413:14.45]You have Rivers of Blood?
[413:15.65]I sold Rivers of Blood for a joke because I said, look what I'm doing to the OP item.
[413:24.10]Hold on.
[413:24.76]Is this standard...
[413:39.07]Upgrades.
[413:39.85]Stones.
[413:48.83]Is it somber?
[413:51.68]I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[413:55.02]Okay.
[413:56.54]I can do it.
[413:56.88]I can get up to 8.
[413:57.62]I mean, plus 9.
[413:58.04]Or plus 8.
[414:06.84]Why do you keep playing this game?
[414:07.84]It has taken you like a year to complete it.
[414:12.40]My friend.
[414:15.22]We're doing a random... You respond to that.
[414:19.09]Um... Oh, jeez.
[414:24.79]Oh, jeez.
[414:28.41]Does this scale more with strength or dex?
[414:30.23]Probably strength, I would imagine.
[414:31.31]28, 18, okay.
[414:35.51]Oh yeah, I forgot that I had the true counter.
[414:38.48]We win now.
[415:25.05]Need Arcane.
[415:29.86]No, I don't.
[415:31.90]No.
[415:32.44]This thing already has 70 bleed.
[415:36.46]It's quality scaling.
[415:42.31]Is that alright?
[415:47.79]No, no Arcane.
[415:53.68]Should I put the other two in?
[415:54.64]Should I do 22 or 37?
[415:56.02]Go like 30, 27?
[416:02.30]If it's quality scaling, then this is fine, right?
[416:20.29]It scales D in both.
[416:27.05]You're so fucked, dude.
[416:37.61]What about the dagger, you dumbass?
[416:39.97]We're going for a new strategy.
[416:41.23]I'm going for just pizza cutter.
[416:45.24]It's a C when it's... Okay, so then this is... Yeah, this is fine.
[416:49.28]Like that.
[416:50.26]Now I can just go like this.
[416:52.26]Boom, boom, boom, right?
[416:55.41]That's fine.
[416:56.73]This is fine.
[417:02.12]Hey there, pal.
[417:02.82]Do you have any Smithing Stone sevens?
[417:05.46]I probably do.
[417:07.98]This is fine.
[417:08.37]Yeah.

[418:04.80]Uh, by Fia.
[418:08.92]Underground.
[418:24.76]Let this guy fucking knead his dough.
[418:36.01]Malenia you don't stand a chance Malenia you are gonna die in Minecraft
[419:02.44]Let's absolutely power this thing up.
[419:08.94]What?
[419:09.40]Oh, sure.
[419:11.88]So for this next fight, I was thinking of hiring someone off like a like a gamer website to like use, like, you know, take control of my PC and play for me.
[419:23.15]And then you can act like you're doing it.
[419:27.43]I just want to let you guys know, I decided not to.
[419:30.05]Very good idea.
[419:32.76]Actually, I have a bell bearing to look at.
[419:38.17]That gamer website.
[419:45.91]I'm ready unless there's a smithing seven.
[419:49.92]I cannot help you out there.
[419:53.94]I only have up to six.
[420:08.47]Just wanted to go the long way.
[420:11.13]Okay.
[420:12.57]I wonder how much better this is going to be.
[420:14.22]I feel like it's going to be.
[420:15.74]People are giving me shit for this, but I feel like it's going to be better.
[420:18.40]220.
[420:22.02]This thing, look at this.
[420:26.24]269, 119 already.

[421:03.93]Alright, people are gonna be really upset with me, but I don't care.
[421:30.39]Hey, if you're ever in need of runes, just go to where Fia is.
[421:35.42]Walk forward, like not towards her, but like the other way.
[421:39.06]Two seconds, you get 11,000.
[421:40.16]Just reset it and you do it as many times as you want.
[421:42.22]If I ever need runes, I'm just going to kill Malenia.
[421:44.40]Okay.
[421:57.96]I just wanted to get it.

[425:23.61]want to go again or what like what's going on here I'm fine okay I haven't fought this boss before
[425:53.44]That's maybe our worst attempt yet.
[426:04.59]Just keep her in the corner.
[426:13.63]I'm dead.
[426:20.45]Surely it gets better.
[426:22.38]This thing's fucking awful.
[426:24.22]This thing is bad.
[426:42.40]I want her to heal!
[426:55.01]Yeah, I expected it to deal damage.
[427:13.85]I don't have any more Larval Tears.
[427:16.99]We said this was horrible.
[427:19.88]Well, if I... Okay, hold on.
[427:21.84]I feel like this would be really good if we could coordinate it.
[427:26.38]So, like, I go in there and I just start, like, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, and you can just get in there and just attack with all your most powerful moves.
[427:35.99]You grind her and I common the Zor?
[427:39.37]I mean, I wish you had it.
[427:42.10]I do.
[427:42.90]You do?
[427:43.82]Yeah.
[427:45.38]Maybe we could try to be just wacky.
[427:48.71]I don't think it's going to do that much.
[427:49.77]My staff isn't upgraded as much.
[428:02.04]Watch out, bad guys.
[428:05.48]Let's get in the Vader.
[428:13.66]What if we just, like, hit her?
[428:14.92]Yep.
[428:16.64]That would work, too.
[428:17.36]This thing does pretty good damage, though.
[428:25.21]I was doing, like, an 1100 to swing right there.
[428:29.17]Alright, let's go for it.
[428:32.57]I think it's a little slower than the thing I was using before.
[428:34.43]Alright.
[428:49.63]Okay.
[428:51.53]Not bad.
[428:52.79]Not bad.
[428:58.15]I had an aneurysm and forgot how to switch to my shield.
[429:15.24]My chat says you have to sprint away during that move.
[429:42.44]Don't laugh, I'm doing alright!
[429:46.02]You're grinding her while she's just like fucking punching you in the face.
[429:56.69]It's just a lot of stamina.
[429:59.18]Okay, if you were alive, we could have done pretty good.
[430:02.88]I messed up bad.
[430:03.74]I had a goof moment.
[430:10.55]For like a brief second when she went up in the air, I could feel that I was in the Matrix and I kind of doubted the reality.
[430:18.26]Yeah, the L2 is not really... Can I do any moves from L2?
[430:22.94]I wonder.
[430:23.24]Let me check.
[430:30.92]You cannot.
[430:36.72]Why everybody does that?
[430:37.65]Anytime you look down to look at something down your shirt or you touch your eyes, everybody goes... Why?
[430:45.43]Why?
[431:05.75]the fuck is that what is what they just like make up new enemies down here I'm dead
[431:23.34]There's that dog.
[431:34.17]See you up there.
[431:35.57]Coming boss.
[431:39.03]Hopefully this time the sky like doesn't fall on me.
[431:49.51]Use the Black Knife.
[431:50.35]I don't think I can anymore.
[431:51.51]I needed 18 faith, which 8 points to be able to do that one move, I don't think is worth it.
[432:09.52]Keep her in the corner.
[432:10.46]There's a closer bonfire.
[432:13.46]Yeah, I've heard people say that.
[432:15.42]But we're in gamer fatigue mode right now.
[432:17.61]I don't think you can... You wouldn't be able to direct us to where we need to go.
[432:27.09]That guy is sick of getting killed.
[432:35.90]He's left over the bridge.
[432:38.22]Maybe we'll give it a look.
[432:56.85]That was not worth the mana.
[432:58.75]Not really, but it was a very good knockback.
[433:08.67]Oh, that's fucking fantastic.
[433:28.66]We got our locks in.
[433:29.99]We do!
[433:32.97]Okay, easy, easy.
[433:33.35]I'm gonna die.
[433:38.48]I can't believe I didn't.
[433:59.47]Oh no!
[434:00.25]No stamina.
[434:10.79]Just getting ready for the next phase.
[434:18.52]What was the stagger on that?
[434:19.94]Shit.
[434:25.60]That was the first time I got hit by the second part.
[434:38.63]Oh, fuck off.
[434:52.40]Stop losing fucking lock-on!
[435:12.67]Come on, you piece of shit!
[435:23.44]kill her oh
[435:59.56]Can I do a fucking move in the fucking video game?
[436:04.33]No.
[436:11.98]Dude, you can't even swing at her.
[436:15.24]You can't swing the fucking weapon at her.
[436:19.08]She's just constantly doing a move.
[436:22.92]Her stamina was almost out.
[436:31.68]It's just... I feel like she's just going like this.
[436:38.84]Can I play?
[436:39.46]FromSoftware, can I play the game?
[436:50.57]That is the game.
[436:53.90]It's a dance.
[436:56.92]Yeah, you gotta remember.
[436:59.53]Dude, it's a dance.
[437:01.47]Well, can we just, can we like, can we do like, can we fucking floss or something?
[437:12.16]You shouldn't use this, your weapon's too slow.
[437:15.16]What, we just have to delete a whole class of items to play against Millenia?
[437:30.17]The Omenkiller?
[437:31.45]I feel like the Omenkiller was slower.
[437:33.03]Alright, last attempt.
[437:39.32]Last attempt before we put a new seed in and delete her from the game.
[437:45.62]Now I'm angry.
[437:52.71]Hopefully not too angry.
[437:55.63]Not just angry enough to fucking like go hard.
[437:58.53]Oh, I've done hard.
[438:08.39]Got it.
[438:15.28]Back to one.
[438:21.89]Oh, because I don't have as much stamina or fucking health as I did before.
[438:25.86]So I don't even think I can do that anymore.
[438:52.61]Sorry, sir.
[438:53.09]This is personal.
[438:55.97]No, that's cool.
[438:57.79]My bad for... Yeah.
[439:02.30]For existing.
[439:19.85]Okay.
[439:33.09]Thank you.
[440:07.74]Come on, fuck you.
[440:10.99]I thought I dodged again.
[440:51.03]But, like, what if we did, like, one more?
[440:53.97]I didn't get a fair one.
[440:55.01]It wasn't fair.
[440:55.73]She had more health than when you fucking died.
[440:58.91]I fought her for, like, an extra five minutes.
[441:03.17]Yeah.
[441:06.50]Yeah.
[441:10.12]You know what they say.
[441:11.64]Can't win them all.
[441:21.97]Change your weapon.
[441:24.09]It's over.
[441:24.95]I can't.
[441:26.97]The only way I can change this weapon is if we randomly get another larval here.
[441:32.14]Somewhere.
[441:33.14]I have one.
[441:34.18]You do?
[441:35.14]Yeah.
[441:35.70]I'm honestly not giving up on this yet, though.
[441:37.86]Actually, the bleed is really good when you get it to go off.
[441:42.94]I think it's okay.
[441:43.82]I don't hate it.
[441:46.20]That went real quick from if we had a larval tier to no.
[441:51.00]It's really not that bad.
[441:54.38]Stagger is good.
[441:54.88]I just can't see anything out of this helmet.
[441:57.30]I fucked up my respect because I have less health and less stamina.
[441:59.82]It's just why I got shit on a lot quicker than I thought I was.
[442:05.30]I just want to smoke weed with The Bed of Chaos.
[442:07.52]I just really want that.
[442:38.86]There we go.
[442:39.52]Yeah.
[442:40.23]Let's go.
[442:40.77]Let's go.
[442:41.27]And the bleed too.
[442:43.65]Play an extra save.
[442:44.77]Play safe.
[442:46.45]Yep, exactly why we just did that.
[442:48.25]You're good, you're good, you're good, you're good, you're good, you're good, you're good, you're good.
[442:54.55]Everything's all good, man, we're good.
[443:19.31]Could do it again soon.
[443:35.10]Yeah.
[443:38.66]Good.
[443:39.22]Very clean.
[443:41.17]So clean.
[443:42.25]Well diddled.
[443:53.74]Sucks losing the... Nice.
[444:01.85]Woo!
[444:02.37]No, no, no!
[444:16.96]Fuck!
[444:28.16]Paranoid.
[444:34.49]Alright, eat whatever you got.
[444:35.79]Eat whatever you got.
[444:45.03]No!
[444:45.68]I'm in the run!
[444:46.52]I'm in the run!
[444:47.08]Get me out of here!
[444:51.60]That doesn't reach.
[444:52.16]No!
[445:02.79]I'm gonna die.
[445:03.33]That's fine, she won't leave me alone.
[445:07.80]I mean, I have Rot.
[445:11.54]It was in the worst possible spot.
[445:13.34]Send it!
[445:13.96]Send it!
[445:14.82]No, it's over, man.
[445:18.44]She landed.
[445:18.88]I dodged it and I was just in it.
[445:20.38]I was trying to get away from her because of... Oh, this is such fucking hell in this room.
[445:42.91]That was a really good first round.
[445:45.63]It's just... The second round is just... It's just like... Fucked.
[445:50.02]I mean, you didn't really even get to do the second round.
[445:52.76]No.
[445:54.46]You walked back into it.
[445:55.48]I know, but it's like... It's just... I'm trying to get away and...
[445:59.51]At the, uh, at the cross of the church, if you go into those, like, big extra areas, she can never land on you.
[446:04.52]If, like, we're close enough.
[446:05.84]We weren't really.
[446:07.54]I just was so hellbent on eating that I just forgot.
[446:12.04]It was like, I just forgot that this is the worst boss they've ever fucking made.
[446:16.78]This guy's just hungry.
[446:18.30]I just forget.
[446:19.94]I forget sometimes.
[446:20.58]This is the shittiest thing they've ever created.
[446:23.40]Can't wait to smoke a fat fucking blunt with better chaos, I'm telling you.
[446:26.68]It's gonna be so good.
[446:32.23]I am gonna vent.
[446:33.65]I am gonna vent at The Bed of Chaos.
[446:36.09]We're gonna be high as fuck.
[446:37.81]And I'm just gonna be like, let me tell you something.
[446:40.21]Let me tell you about Valenia.
[446:57.42]He's venting.
[447:05.04]Alright.
[447:17.03]Easy.
[447:20.37]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[447:30.84]I don't even know where the fuck I was.
[447:33.94]I was stuck on two pillars.
[447:35.42]I think I'm still old.
[447:52.21]No, never mind.
[447:53.25]I was going to say I thought I was still in a plus one class.
[447:57.89]What plus is your flask cap?
[448:01.27]10.
[448:02.51]What the fuck?
[448:03.47]Oh, no, no, no.
[448:03.87]You mean how much actually healing?
[448:05.65]Yeah.
[448:06.57]Let me see.
[448:18.40]I mean.
[448:18.76]It's a plus six.
[448:27.17]I have a lot more health.
[448:28.93]Yeah.
[448:35.47]Can you use the Black Knife?
[448:39.56]I'm back in.
[448:41.96]Do you have any faith at all?
[448:44.76]Nope.
[448:45.20]No.
[448:48.72]Only in our next attempt do I have faith.
[448:52.04]Alright.
[448:52.28]Let's try this one more time.
[448:57.36]Put on bleed grease just to keep it going.
[449:02.43]Scarlet rot.
[449:04.79]I don't have any bleed grease.
[449:12.07]Skip her.
[449:13.13]We unfortunately cannot.
[449:16.26]And there's a bunch of other shit we could do, but she kind of is.
[449:19.52]We need two great runes to go further in Leyndell.
[449:23.36]Wait, there's another way in there.
[449:25.96]What's the other way?
[449:28.85]Were you coming from like the catacombs?
[449:30.74]I think where Astel is.
[449:31.66]I don't know.
[449:38.68]Now she won't drop a great rune, but the game progress is through here.
[449:42.88]Because we kind of... I don't know if there's any other game progress we can really do.
[449:47.16]This is kind of the wall right now.
[449:49.08]Can you take Tish?
[449:51.32]Can I drop it for you?
[449:52.67]Let's see.
[449:55.33]I cannot drop it.
[449:56.49]I don't have a lot of mana either.
[450:02.98]This is optional, but I thought there's no other, aren't we kind of locked out?
[450:07.07]We can't go to the capital.
[450:09.49]I mean, we could go, can we even get to Mohg?
[450:13.63]I think so.
[450:15.83]We could do Mohg, maybe.
[450:18.11]Not tonight, but.
[450:19.29]There's tons of shit we could do.
[450:21.57]The shit that we want to do was fast here.
[450:23.65]Right.
[450:27.47]What?
[450:54.46]Is she gonna do it?
[450:55.88]Yeah.
[451:00.70]No, please don't do it.
[451:03.24]Oh, please.
[451:05.82]Oh, please.
[451:08.76]That's rough and you handled it like a champ.
[451:10.72]Thank you.
[451:16.00]Your chat would be parking.
[451:17.98]I hope they are.
[451:39.85]That's rough.
[451:45.91]Careful.
[451:46.73]I sense it.
[451:47.55]There's a disturbance.
[451:51.49]I was going to say that, but I was too concentrated.
[452:03.17]What the hell did she just do?
[452:05.11]Whoa, she's behind me.
[452:06.25]I didn't know she was there.
[452:09.02]She's definitely gonna fucking kill me.
[452:12.54]She's mad.
[452:21.06]Yeah.
[452:48.08]Okay.
[453:02.52]Oh, she's behind the pillar for me, she's up Oh motherfucker Yeah, I didn't realize she was gonna instantly go for that I thought it was the other one
[453:22.70]so so
[453:51.69]Okay.
[454:39.85]Let me swing my weapon
[455:17.19]Never mind It's I just got no I don't I think you got this I have no heels Do you need them?
[455:30.20]Good point
[455:44.29]Yep.
[455:53.29]Try attacking her when I swing one time, she swings five and I die.
[456:21.15]Need a katana?
[456:21.79]I'm telling you, this game should have a sniper rifle.
[456:26.99]Dude, I'm pulling the plug in, like, in five minutes.
[456:39.95]If only you had a faster weapon.
[456:42.70]Why do I have to play with it?
[456:45.14]Didn't we argue about this?
[456:47.70]Why can't I play with the weapon I want to play with?
[456:49.54]Why do I have to play with the weapon that you're supposed to play with to beat Millenia?
[456:52.32]It's not fair.
[456:57.72]Well, if you beat her with this weapon, then you would have beat her with a weapon you're not supposed to use to beat her.
[457:00.98]That's true.
[457:02.10]You just have to beat her.
[457:05.63]Like, just do it.
[457:24.27]I don't like her over here you can't hide true and I god damn I have so little health after the respec
[457:52.76]Alright, I'm going to find like an exploit.
[457:54.10]I don't know.
[458:08.72]The eraser, you just delete her.
[458:19.82]I'm just gonna die.
[458:46.91]Blackknife, we only have one Laravel tier, and Ster is talking about how his build is not very good.
[458:54.15]No, mine is great.
[458:54.99]It's just I need a little more life.
[458:58.16]You can take it.
[459:04.12]I am so scared to go back to Faith.
[459:09.95]I don't think the pizza cut is the problem.
[459:11.01]We're doing a lot of damage.
[459:14.86]Alright, we're doing one more attempt.
[459:16.12]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[459:17.26]I haven't fucking... Already left.
[459:19.72]I mean, we could just go explore other dungeons to try to find a great rune.
[459:25.76]Uh-oh.
[459:30.86]I might have goofed.
[459:32.88]You alright?
[459:35.16]Yeah, I used the remembrance I had to get enough for a level, and I'm a little bit short.
[459:41.68]I unfortunately don't have anything.
[459:43.02]No, I got enough.
[459:43.64]I got enough.
[459:48.71]Oh yeah, I'm missing a lot of points and bigger than I have before.
[459:51.35]Like, down 10.
[459:59.45]Put on more armor?
[460:00.21]I mean, I have, like, this armor is heavy as shit.
[460:05.82]Okay.
[460:20.99]Disable her healing Like I'll just go like full DPS and you can resume I Mean the knife was really good.
[460:34.45]It was doing It was just taking damage It didn't seem good
[460:42.84]It was, but I mean, I would have to go back to faith.
[460:46.18]I really thought that bleed was going to be really good.
[460:47.68]I mean, we're doing a lot of damage.
[460:49.04]We're getting through phase one pretty much like 60% of the time.
[460:52.60]It's just very hard for me on this low of life and stamina to survive a waterfowl.
[461:03.95]So we absolutely could just do other stuff and level, but either way, I think we've probably done it for the night.
[461:09.85]I mean, I'm probably going to eat my keyboard if we do this for like another hour.
[461:27.65]Not risking it.
[461:28.51]She going to go crazy.
[461:35.88]Oh fuck, I got stuck.
[461:37.62]Oh fuck.
[461:40.70]Oh man, oh boy.
[461:43.39]Not doing it again, are you?
[461:44.89]Oh, that's not good.
[461:51.58]Two in a row look at our health just like back to full health I'm just taking like collateral damage
[462:23.05]I'm dead.
[462:28.85]Yeah, we would have to do other stuff.
[462:30.95]I just don't have enough health.
[462:34.30]What if I beat her right now, though?
[462:36.86]I mean, do it.
[462:39.66]I'm all for it.
[463:11.89]I was trying to jump!
[463:23.23]This is exactly what we did to Placidusax, by the way.
[463:26.86]What do you mean?
[463:29.08]Well, we fought Placidusax for like a whole night and he was destroying us.
[463:33.32]And we were like, okay, fine, let's go do other stuff.
[463:34.89]And then we came back and it was like, wow, this is really easy.
[463:38.41]I would rather smoke fucking three blunts with Placidusax than do this.
[463:53.19]That's more than anything.
[464:02.83]Alright.
[464:04.30]What do you say we cool off for a little bit and we go and do a little dungeon or something?
[464:10.92]Just like cool off in a dungeon?
[464:12.38]Let's cool off in a dungeon.
[464:13.24]Let's cool off.
[464:14.50]Okay.
[464:17.76]I know some content that we can do.
[464:21.64]It's Malenia.
[464:23.11]Hey, let's do six on passing.
[464:25.19]Mm hmm.
[464:26.39]Hey, anybody want anybody want Malenia here?
[464:29.21]No, no, no, no way.
[464:31.45]She sucks.
[464:32.53]Yeah, button.
[464:42.32]I voted.
[464:43.64]You did?
[464:44.54]Yeah.
[464:45.38]We're going to Limgrave tunnels.
[464:47.14]Yeah.
[464:52.89]I voted, but it won't work.
[464:56.73]Can you do it right this time?
[465:09.47]We're going up.
[465:09.87]Up.
[465:23.20]Just take a nice little chill detour.
[465:26.30]To fight a boss is equally as hard as Millenium.
[465:31.94]What is it?
[465:32.36]Have we seen this before?
[465:34.08]What are we doing?
[465:35.56]We're doing a first dragon.
[465:41.61]Oh, this sounds pretty relaxing.
[465:44.57]Look at that big boy.
[465:47.89]Look at that big old chonker.
[465:49.69]That guy's massive.
[465:54.86]Now this is content.
[466:13.23]Ah, shit!
[466:13.85]He's almost got me!
[466:15.13]Watch out!
[466:17.77]Claws!
[466:28.69]Buh!
[466:33.48]Buh!
[466:33.82]I would say then that's great because we don't have to fucking play that other dumb stupid fucking part of the fucking game.
[466:47.58]Oh, the fucking stupid fucking goddamn fucking stupid fucking thing.
[467:02.03]He's delaying it.
[467:03.13]He's delaying.
[467:03.91]Did he disappear?
[467:15.74]He's ready to go back.
[467:16.28]He went back.
[467:16.72]Okay.
[467:16.92]Alright.
[467:19.70]Great Rune of Radahn.
[467:32.88]got uh the glaive I didn't I didn't really get anything that was nice dude sick that was that's bum that felt pretty good that was great okay wait what about some of the jails I know there's a few we didn't do there's a ton we didn't do we did like two jails in the whole game did we do this wait can we even okay we're looking for some jails
[468:02.13]This is the third tree over here we didn't do.
[468:05.61]Let's go.
[468:05.99]Alright.
[468:07.35]One more relaxing battle.
[468:12.05]Wait, let's turn the Deathbird in.
[468:13.69]We might get a great run.
[468:24.74]Every item is just one item.
[468:26.12]And the next one, that next one.
[468:29.58]Wait, is he gone?
[468:30.94]No, I'm here.
[468:31.38]Oh.
[468:40.30]We're not doing heroes grave, no way.
[468:47.04]OK.
[468:51.00]I smell it feeding me tarnished.
[468:54.46]I should feed me.
[468:56.80]I didn't get anything cool.
[468:59.94]Shit.
[469:09.35]Alright, what?
[469:12.09]There's something else we can do, right?
[469:14.23]There's the other route that goes into Leyndell.
[469:18.40]From below, which is Astal.
[469:25.04]I totally don't think we were done with Nokron.
[469:27.64]We could go kill the big dragon, the big sleeping dragon.
[469:32.04]Just like a free hundred something thousand souls.
[469:35.52]Also true.
[469:36.26]Let's go do that.
[469:37.54]What if he's replaced?
[469:39.30]Might be.
[469:43.13]Uh, do you get there from here?
[469:44.35]Yeah, you do.
[469:44.69]Yeah, you can get there from here.
[469:46.81]I don't know where you want.
[469:47.57]I see.
[469:48.25]Let's walk toward.
[469:53.49]Ster.
[469:54.59]I've... Ster.
[469:56.38]I got... We're good.
[469:58.22]What?
[469:58.62]Run saved.
[470:00.48]Actual run saved.
[470:01.22]I just got the key to the manor.
[470:05.20]I just got the key to the fucking manor.
[470:07.88]Was it at this tree?
[470:08.82]It was at the tree.
[470:10.08]I've told you to pick that up like twice.
[470:11.98]You have...
[470:14.30]this fucking guy alright but hold on oh okay we're good let's keep playing hey I'm gonna go turn into a death root if you there's like a tree down there and you've been getting like good items from the trees let's um get him to quiet and then uh let's fight this dragon let's get into quiet let's um I don't think I've stood up in eight hours
[470:41.77]Yeah, like I'm surprised you didn't even ask for like a pee break or anything.
[470:44.75]Yeah, let's do that.
[470:45.79]I haven't stood up in like seven.
[470:47.14]Holy, that's actually bad.
[470:48.18]What time is it?
[470:50.28]930.
[470:50.34]I feel like I feel like legitimately this is gamer addiction, like a gamer health alert.
[470:57.06]I need to get up tomorrow and
[471:00.07]Yeah.
[471:01.65]Hey, I got it.
[471:02.35]I could play a bit longer, but I got a proposition for you.
[471:05.32]Yeah, I know that we were going to go tomorrow, too.
[471:08.46]But.
[471:09.74]Do you want to you want to do it on Monday or Tuesday instead?
[471:14.00]That works for me, OK?
[471:16.38]Because there's a couple of things that I probably need to do tomorrow.
[471:20.29]So probably.
[471:23.55]Um.
[471:25.83]Let me just make sure I get it right.
[471:27.11]You want to do it on Monday?
[471:30.80]Yeah.
[471:32.06]Okay.
[471:33.96]Yeah, this is... We got the key.
[471:37.65]At the very minimum before we leave, let's go kill that big dragon.
[471:42.41]Because we're already here.
[471:43.77]Another dragon fight?
[471:45.35]We're going to get, like, rotted?
[471:46.27]This guy wants another dragon fight.
[471:51.63]We just killed the strongest dragon in the game.
[471:54.34]Well, I mean, I don't mean this one.
[471:55.42]I mean the big one, but this one's got way too much health.
[471:58.46]Oh, yeah, let's go to the big one.
[472:00.80]This guy's freaking out.
[472:05.99]He's going to smoke weed with The Bed of Chaos.
[472:10.37]Yeah, I got plans.
[472:12.31]No.
[472:15.35]God, I fucking hate millennial.
[472:17.29]Hey, remember when we first tried Elden Beast?
[472:20.80]That was actually pretty good.
[472:24.34]We got Gargoyle down here if you want.
[472:26.82]I think it's a good idea.
[472:37.38]for a second when things like when things were nice good times hey I'm not having a bad time by any stretch of the idea I just Malenia just just makes me irrationally upset
[473:05.37]Yeah, I don't like this area I'm in where everything does 75% of my health and damage and I can't heal it in one flash.
[473:11.86]The horse is really easier.
[473:16.32]Run away.
[473:16.56]Never mind.
[473:34.71]Relax, man.
[473:47.04]Nice.
[473:47.48]That one shot me at the health I was at.
[473:51.11]I goofed.
[473:51.59]It's okay.
[473:54.69]Why can I not walk on anymore?
[474:01.86]weird.
[474:03.34]I cannot lock onto this enemy.
[474:30.63]Whoa, that hurts.
[474:31.89]I thought it was just like I'm angry sound.
[474:36.50]Me mad.
[474:44.78]Not locking on is driving me fucking nuts.
[474:47.22]I just couldn't lock on even off the horse.
[474:52.54]Now let's go up to that big dragon and then I'll level vigor.
[474:57.12]Like two or three times.
[475:05.99]Even off the horse, I couldn't do it.
[475:15.58]Alright, let's go kill that dragon and just take the free souls.
[475:19.20]Did you respawn at the bonfire?
[475:21.81]I did not.
[475:23.15]Oh, okay.
[475:24.13]Sometimes I forget how long it takes you to spawn.
[475:29.43]Okay, the big dragon is like over here, right?
[475:34.49]I don't know.
[475:35.27]I always get lost.
[475:37.03]I think it's down here.
[475:41.45]Where are you going?
[475:43.13]I don't know.
[475:44.23]I think we have to go over here.
[475:50.93]That sounds right.
[476:02.04]There's a bonfire down here.
[476:03.64]I know.
[476:10.32]You remember the type of guy to put gold sheets on his food for fun?
[476:13.54]No, I wouldn't.
[476:14.36]Why did we just get 62,000 soul score?
[476:19.20]I don't know.
[476:21.04]You got lobstered.
[476:22.36]You're getting lobstered, friend.
[476:25.87]You're getting... Bye.
[476:27.37]Just leave.
[476:28.81]Just leave without me.
[476:35.79]Okay.
[476:43.39]Where did you go?
[476:45.27]I went down the hill.
[476:47.21]The dragon fell off the bridge.
[476:48.93]Holy shit.
[476:51.23]Okay.
[476:52.88]Let's kill this dragon, get the souls, level up a couple times, and then I'll see you Monday.
[476:58.34]Okay.
[477:03.32]What level are you?
[477:03.90]84.
[477:05.94]Okay, we're actually pretty close.
[477:09.28]I'm a 79er.
[477:09.54]Hmm.
[477:18.62]Alright.
[477:19.70]Over here somewhere.
[477:23.20]The game fact says that a lot of people don't fight Malenia until they're level 300.
[477:26.32]The worst fucking boss ever made.
[477:31.80]Like, yeah.
[477:33.22]I would want to go in there at a level 1,000 and just hit her once.
[477:36.10]Okay, where is this dragon?
[477:49.00]um I think he he's not here where all the yeah all the dragons are gone too yeah he would normally be here just kick me
[478:23.82]I where isn't where is I'm he's not here he's not here okay hey this is jail change of plans yeah jail I don't know where the you are I'm gonna say there's the castle at the top that has the uh the dectus medallion and maybe that item is a good item oh
[478:49.16]I don't know where the hell you are.
[478:51.52]I'm at the jail.
[478:52.70]Over here.
[478:54.90]Where are you?
[478:55.40]Oh, there you are.
[478:56.90]You have to... You are very far away from me.
[478:59.63]Holy shit.
[479:00.37]How did we get so separate?
[479:01.33]I went to where the dragon is.
[479:03.43]Oh, well.
[479:03.91]Come over here, man.
[479:04.81]We got some cool shit going on.
[479:05.89]You're on the other side of the fucking, like, chasm.
[479:08.69]Yeah, I knew there was no dragon.
[479:10.48]I was just testing to see your gamer skills.
[479:21.26]Here I come.
[479:22.72]Here I come.
[479:23.40]They're saying the dragon is not randomized.
[479:25.14]They can say that all they want, but it's not there.
[479:30.47]Okay, here we go.
[479:46.40]100% there.
[479:46.72]I was just up at the fort.
[479:51.20]I hope this is easy because I have 63,000 souls.
[479:59.05]Godfrey.
[480:01.76]But he's a battle mage.
[480:19.58]ever just wish you could roll up into a ball and be like a roly-poly actually kind of cool like if you come across like a big hill you're like oh that's fine I could just like turn into a ball can you hit him like it's some it's some aggro I've been hitting him this whole time can you hit him like four more times
[480:48.19]He just really does not like you.
[480:49.60]I hope you're, uh... Let them have it.
[480:55.78]Oh, nice bleed.
[480:56.52]Oh.
[481:13.59]Where is this?
[481:14.03]Not in this run?
[481:30.21]Oops.
[481:36.73]What's this?
[481:37.19]Wait, Battle Mage Godefroy?
[481:42.30]Wait, I thought it was.
[481:46.80]Is that how it's spelled?
[481:48.30]There is a Godfrey that normally appears in one of the jails.
[481:52.14]I don't know.
[481:52.62]Maybe they call him Godfrey.
[481:56.19]I feel like you just made that up.
[481:58.13]Yeah, we got like the grocery store toy version of them.
[482:02.99]It's the mini boss version.
[482:03.99]Okay.
[482:08.67]Okay, cool.
[482:20.85]You should look at the cheat sheet in the randomizer files.
[482:24.91]It will tell you where some of the stuff is.
[482:30.85]Now that we have the manarchy, we don't have to worry about it anymore.
[482:32.92]Not for at least a little while.
[482:37.32]Welcome to Fort Faroth.
[482:40.08]Where the big dragon is.
[482:44.10]Yeah.
[482:53.15]and at the end of this we're gonna get a great rune of um a mystique x-men character
[483:37.27]Will you get away?
[483:37.91]Oh, thanks for the meat.
[483:51.72]Do you know the secret place to get the trinket here?
[483:56.36]The secret place?
[483:58.72]No.
[484:02.50]I left when you guys discovered you needed the key.
[484:04.71]Watch the entire Royal Rumber pay-per-view.
[484:08.05]And first thing I hear when I come back is we finally have the manor key.
[484:13.33]Moog's great room.
[484:15.03]Really?
[484:15.91]Actually, yeah.
[484:16.85]Oh, thank God.
[484:18.03]Our next time we turn this on is going to be so much better.
[484:20.64]which also we could get into landil now because yeah I'm pretty sure the mod makes it two great runes to get in that's a bit of a Mohg like that's a great moment I think it happened in the last five ten minutes of the stream we spent we spent 99 of the stream fighting I don't know what I just did and then we went and did one other like side quest and like okay we got a great rune that's what I'm saying
[484:49.23]We're gonna go, we're gonna like play for a day.
[484:51.85]Like on Monday.
[484:52.85]And at the end of the day, at the end of the day on Monday, we fight Malenia.
[484:57.41]And it's gonna be like, we're just gonna fucking shit down her blouse.
[485:01.85]What the fuck?
[485:10.21]Oh, you did the same thing I did.
[485:12.51]You did the same.
[485:13.39]I figured solidarity.
[485:14.97]Ah, thank you.
[485:16.61]Makes you feel better.
[485:18.40]Alright, well that was fun.
[485:24.83]We made a lot of progress.
[485:27.01]I actually think... Here's my prediction.
[485:29.93]Because we've got... We've got to kill whatever is in Rykar's room.
[485:35.75]And then we do the capital.
[485:37.99]We could potentially beat the game on Monday.
[485:42.35]It's possible.
[485:44.69]I think it'll be pretty easy.
[485:46.71]Because, like... The only, like, terror that we have not seen is Radon.
[485:54.08]Yeah.
[485:54.99]So if like the Elden Beast or any of those fights isn't Radon and just go fight, you know, like the main quest stuff, like that could be a mad soldier at this point.
[486:06.28]Who knows?
[486:06.68]It really could be.
[486:07.94]Where the Elden Beast is and where Hoarah Loux is, it could just be something so simple.
[486:12.02]It could be like an ulcerated tree spirit.
[486:19.16]Yep.
[486:20.90]Alright.
[486:22.16]Well, no, that was fun.
[486:23.58]Malenia sucks.
[486:25.70]Just want to say that again.
[486:30.36]We'll beat her though.
[486:31.62]We will.
[486:33.88]I'm confident.
[486:35.74]I'm also confident with like 10 more levels.
[486:38.95]I think we would... It would be so much easier with like 10 levels.
[486:45.01]It would be.
[486:50.87]Uh...
[486:52.59]Do not banish me yet.
[486:54.38]I know you want to, but hold on.
[486:56.74]You're banished.
[486:58.16]Don't do it.
[486:58.82]I'm serious because I'm about to get the treasure chest.
[487:02.26]The treasure chest.
[487:04.92]Okay, you can ban me now.
[487:09.62]I can't believe that was actually a great run.
[487:21.88]I'm now alone.
[487:25.20]Well, we killed Rykard.
[487:26.24]We killed the weird version of Rykard.
[487:27.70]We didn't kill the actual Rykard.
[487:30.78]We killed the... Phase 1 Rykard, technically.
[487:34.06]Yeah, we killed Rykard in the Valiant-Golem double fight.
[487:42.13]Which I'm surprised that wasn't two enemies.
[487:46.85]Yeah.
[487:50.51]I don't think I have anything else I can do.
[487:56.07]Do I?
[487:58.95]All there is to do is stand near Fia's entrance and get 10k souls.
[488:06.32]Could do that.
[488:09.40]I'm going.
[488:09.90]I'm going.
[488:10.48]I'm really tired.
[488:11.58]Thanks, Luster.
[488:13.00]I've just got some backpack pork.
[488:16.09]Go relax.
[488:17.21]You have kind of a stressful last 24 hours.
[488:19.71]Go chill.
[488:20.85]Yeah.
[488:20.97]Alright.
[488:23.17]We'll see you soon.
[488:23.61]We'll see you Monday.
[488:24.33]Yeah.
[488:24.49]Okay.
[488:24.73]Yeah.
[488:25.90]Yeah.
[488:26.70]See you Monday.
[488:27.22]Yeah.
[488:32.26]Alright.
[488:32.48]Yeah.
[488:35.26]That was, uh, we made some pretty good progress.
[488:39.77]We were on Malenia for like three hours, three and a half, four hours.
[488:44.21]It kind of par for the course.
[488:45.83]I think it,
[488:51.28]I wonder, before I go, is there anything else I can do?
[488:54.92]I don't think so.
[489:01.59]Great stream.
[489:04.67]I didn't get too angry.
[489:08.19]I don't think, I think this pales in comparison to when I actually played the real Millennium.
[489:15.49]Yeah, we'll see you Monday.
[489:16.99]Same thing.
[489:18.01]Maybe we'll beat it, maybe we won't.
[489:19.11]If we don't, then we'll finish it up a day or two later, I'm imagining.
[489:22.14]Maybe one more weekend.
[489:34.08]Yeah.
[489:35.28]I think that's good here.
[489:36.34]I'll just call it right here.
[489:38.12]Thanks for watching.
[489:39.26]We'll see you on Monday.
[489:40.73]Have a good rest of your weekend.
[489:41.61]There's still Sunday left, so have a good one.
[489:49.30]And then after Monday, I'll probably do a... I don't know.
[489:54.44]There's a lot of things I want to play.
[489:58.42]Monday at... Let me talk to... I probably could have just asked him.
[490:03.54]Assume somewhere between 2 and 3 p.m.
[490:06.04]Pacific.
[490:07.58]That's where we'll probably end up in.
[490:10.05]But yeah.
[490:11.59]Take care.
[490:11.95]See you guys later.
[490:12.99]This tip, we still can hang on for a second.
[490:31.79]What level is my character?
[490:32.61]84, and I believe Ster is 80.
[490:34.37]Going to do some more chill stuff?
[490:41.49]Absolutely.
[490:42.03]Play pentiment in your spare time.
[490:52.04]It's a little slow at the start.
[490:55.10]I think I actually tried it for like an hour, and it was a little too slow for me, and I was like, oh, this ain't for me.
[491:01.82]But I feel like I kind of didn't give it the right amount of time.
[491:12.81]What about Dead Space?
[491:16.35]I could probably play Dead Space.
[491:26.24]Put it on the list.
[491:37.28]Is the remake any good?
[491:37.98]I've seen a lot of people playing it.
[491:39.83]Is it any good or not, though?
[491:43.51]This sounds like I fucking smashed something in my room.
[491:48.59]This is the cam's off, nobody can see me, and I'm just like... Fuck this goddamn game.
[492:01.08]What about Hi-Fi Rush?
[492:01.94]Hi-Fi Rush is... I'm playing it just kind of hanging out off-stream.
[492:09.64]And I will tell you, it feels like it's going to be one of the great ones this year.
[492:18.17]But yeah.
[492:19.25]Take it easy.
[492:19.67]See you guys later.
[492:20.21]See you Monday.
[492:20.62]Have a great night.
[492:22.70]Take care of yourselves.
[492:25.22]See you soon.
[492:27.30]Goodbye and goodnight.
[492:42.58]you
[493:17.42]Thank you.
