[00:02.03]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:03.59]Jerma here with a very quick, very important PSA video on YouTube.
[00:08.37]I don't even need to introduce this video.
[00:09.87]I'm going to get right into it.
[00:10.91]We all know what the problem is.
[00:12.03]We all know what's going on the last few days.
[00:13.53]The comment section.
[00:15.13]Nobody knows if Google is going to fix this or not, going to change it, going to do this, do that.
[00:19.19]But if you make videos on YouTube, pay attention to this video because it's going to try to prevent you from completely disabling your comment section.
[00:28.14]There is a feature.
[00:29.90]called the blacklisting feature and how this works is it's not just on your channel page this works on your videos as well every video it unfortunately is not retroactive it's only for what happens after you enable it but let's just go over a very quick tutorial you're going to go to your video manager I'm going to show it right here you're going to go to your video manager you're going to go on the left side over here to this thing that says community
[00:54.92]Click that, click right under here to comment settings, and you're gonna get this page right here.
[01:00.38]This box right here is your best fucking friend right now, okay guys?
[01:05.57]Put in here, I'm gonna put a list of things that you should be putting in this box, separated by comma, commas, I almost said comments, separated by commas.
[01:15.54]if you do this every single comment that comes in thereafter is going to be quote under review and will not show up on your videos please please please do this if you don't want to disable your comments completely until they fix this problem share this video to anybody you would ever think that needs this because the last thing we need guys
[01:38.35]is every single YouTube channel turning off their comment section.
[01:41.83]That's the lifeblood.
[01:43.33]That's the audience.
[01:44.23]That's the community.
[01:45.11]That's the engagement.
[01:46.07]That's what we do this for.
[01:48.00]I don't want to turn my comment section off because there's, like, penises and shit in the comment section.
[01:53.18]Like, I don't want to do that.
[01:54.80]So, I gotta thank Star, first of all, for coming up with this.
[01:58.58]He figured this out last night.
[02:00.35]We've been doing research together, talking about it.
[02:02.43]But he deserves some credit for this as well.
[02:04.05]So Star's link will be in the description.
[02:06.49]And that is going to wrap up this video, guys.
[02:08.48]Just a very quick video.
[02:09.54]Wanted to showcase this.
[02:11.08]And let's hope this is changed sooner rather than later so we all don't have to find workarounds to make people able to talk to people in the comment section.
[02:20.85]Alright, guys.
[02:21.29]Take care, everybody.
[02:22.13]See y'all.
