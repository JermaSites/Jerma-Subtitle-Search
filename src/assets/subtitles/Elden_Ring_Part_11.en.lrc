[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.75]What's up?
[00:09.17]Sorry.
[00:10.69]Yeah.
[00:12.17]I told you guys I was going to be live Thursday and Friday.
[00:15.17]I did say that.
[00:19.71]But here we are on Wednesday at 8.20 at night.
[00:25.72]I couldn't wait.
[00:28.24]I wasn't going to wait.
[00:29.10]I'm sorry.
[00:29.50]I couldn't.
[00:34.55]I've had the Elden Ring OST playing since the stream stopped two days ago.
[00:44.92]And it finished.
[00:45.60]I was like, yo, I want to play.
[00:50.18]Right when it got 16 hours, 42 minutes, I was like, I'm turning the stream on now.
[01:04.03]Playing Elden Ring.
[01:07.15]I don't know how long this stream is going to be.
[01:09.67]It's not going to be long.
[01:13.21]Maybe a few, three, four hours.
[01:14.41]I just want to play.
[01:15.25]I want to.
[01:15.93]And then I'm just like, you know what?
[01:17.21]I'm turning the stream on.
[01:17.94]Let's go.
[01:18.78]I wasn't waiting until tomorrow.
[01:19.84]I couldn't.
[01:28.82]Is it Gamer?
[01:29.64]You said Thursday.
[01:30.56]I did.
[01:32.25]But look, let me be fair to me and this channel.
[01:37.87]I would like a show of hands.
[01:40.33]How many of you have seen me tell you that a stream is going to be on Thursday and the stream happens on Saturday?
[01:48.56]Show of hands, please.
[01:54.12]Seeing a lot of raised hands.
[01:57.63]I would say that probably happens 70 to 80% of the time.
[02:03.48]I'll be like, oh, hey, guys.
[02:05.32]It's Wednesday.
[02:05.94]Yeah, that's it.
[02:07.16]That's it for this stream.
[02:08.12]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[02:09.68]And then, like, Monday morning, the sus changes.
[02:13.36]Being, like, Tuesday.
[02:15.50]So, come on.
[02:16.76]For the first time in a long time, we're doing early sus changes.
[02:22.72]Not late.
[02:23.38]Not delays.
[02:24.64]We are releasing the streams early now.
[02:27.14]Last week or so.
[02:27.84]So, this is a reverse delay.
[02:30.66]This is something you're not used to, I know.
[02:32.10]Something I'm not used to.
[02:35.05]But here we are.
[02:41.41]Midnight is very early.
[02:43.47]Well, that's true.
[02:45.31]I could be for a lot of the EU crowd.
[02:48.43]It's seven.
[02:49.25]It's like six, what?
[02:50.35]Five or six o'clock in the morning right now.
[02:53.89]On Thursday.
[02:55.53]If I stream for like another, if I stream for like four or five hours tonight.
[02:59.23]I was early to the stream on Thursday.
[03:01.21]Just think of it that way.
[03:02.01]That's it.
[03:08.53]But we, uh, we're just... I gotta be very clear, though.
[03:11.83]We're getting close to some real... I probably would've said real endgame stuff.
[03:22.76]This journey is getting closer to coming to an end.
[03:27.24]I know there's still a lot to do.
[03:30.14]But... I'm getting close.
[03:36.60]We've received some info last stream that was like, okay, I wonder what that means.
[03:41.80]We're in one of the final zones of the game, unless they pull some weird shit here that I don't know about.
[03:47.80]So, okay.
[03:53.84]Let me just give me one quick second while people trickle in.
[04:01.39]Grab a drink.
[04:36.28]We're good.
[04:41.68]Where's Otto?
[04:42.72]I will show Otto at the end of the night.
[04:46.35]He's comfortable.
[04:48.19]He's not here.
[04:48.99]He's very comfortable in another room.
[04:54.17]I will show Otto before the stream turns off.
[04:56.01]Okay, if I do not show Otto before the stream turns off, and if the three stooges are not added to Fortnite,
[05:06.39]By April 23rd, I will eat a glove on stream.
[05:15.18]Nobody showed that to me.
[05:17.36]You know, all of you forgot about it, but... I made... Okay.
[05:24.54]I made a thing a bit, like a year ago, that said that I was certain that the three stooges were going to be in Fortnite.
[05:29.87]Certain of it.
[05:32.48]There's no, like, there has to be, right?
[05:33.88]There's no way that's not going to happen eventually.
[05:36.22]Don't you?
[05:36.50]You can already see the trailer for it.
[05:44.60]And they'd be, like, poking each other in the eyes and shit, and they would be jumping over.
[05:47.62]It probably will happen, but I might just be too early for it.
[05:51.38]The three stooges are going to be in Fortnite.
[05:53.69]I will die on this hill.
[05:56.23]The Three Stooges will be in Fortnite before the game turns off.
[06:00.89]I'm telling you right now.
[06:02.67]I'm telling you.
[06:08.94]Why?
[06:09.76]Why is everybody else added to the game?
[06:14.06]Look at the Fortnite roster and you tell me that the Three Stooges wouldn't be there?
[06:23.39]The Fortnite skin roster right now is like the old Smash Brothers pretend leaks.
[06:33.58]Like Mrs. Doubtfire was on it and stuff.
[06:36.54]Remember back like in 2000, like fucking 10, 2000, like 12, whatever it was.
[06:49.00]When are you going to get added?
[06:50.12]I'm not getting added to Fortnite.
[06:54.44]Three stooges are too old news.
[06:58.26]This is recycled.
[06:59.26]It's not recycled.
[07:00.12]It's a rehash.
[07:01.36]Okay?
[07:02.32]It's a rerun.
[07:03.04]There's a lot of new people here that did not hear that fucking classic material.
[07:09.18]Anyways, let's go.
[07:14.49]Did they remove building from the game?
[07:16.63]You know what?
[07:16.95]I got a theory for you.
[07:18.83]So, I got a theory.
[07:21.09]They removed building from Fortnite.
[07:23.67]Like an event.
[07:25.37]I think they're testing to see if people like the game more with it off.
[07:29.05]So then they just don't have to ever turn it back on.
[07:31.13]They're McRibbing you guys, don't you understand?
[07:34.84]Like, they're gonna keep doing this.
[07:38.78]Oh look, no building for like a month!
[07:42.64]And they're going to keep bringing it back like the McRib.
[07:44.46]It's going to happen like once every like six months or so.
[07:53.59]Game is actually massively improved without it.
[07:56.05]But here's the problem.
[07:57.44]They've never added the McRib permanently to the menu, have they?
[08:01.16]That's what you have to look at.
[08:04.02]I'm not so sure.
[08:10.92]As popular as the McRib is, it's not on the menu permanently.
[08:14.04]They did it in Jerma Fortnite.
[08:22.79]The McRib is back.
[08:24.25]Yeah, people will be saying, oh, building is gone again.
[08:28.09]Look, the non-building game mode is back.
[08:31.82]And you're all going to download it.
[08:32.80]You're all going to play it.
[08:43.01]The amount of people on my Twitter feed that are going back to Fortnite because the McRib is back is astounding.
[08:48.26]So, be aware of that.
[08:50.08]Alright, I'm going to play Elden Ring.
[08:51.90]Let's go.
[08:58.99]I'm going to look cool for a minute.
[09:04.64]Oh, this is where we were last.
[09:06.28]He looks young.
[09:06.86]This guy's shaved.
[09:07.94]I shave my face and I delete, like, well, here's the thing.
[09:10.68]When I shave my face, I, uh, I, like, lose and gain ten years.
[09:18.54]Like, I always look, like, ten years younger, but I always, like, somehow look, like, five years older as well.
[09:24.15]Because when I shave, like, this part up here gets really much more defined.
[09:29.19]Do you see, like, how old my eyes look and shit?
[09:31.79]Like, I actually kind of have, like, really old-looking eyes.
[09:35.80]This carries the whole face for me.
[09:37.72]This is... This will... This carries the entire face.
[09:39.58]I thought that was a... Okay.
[09:47.58]No game audio?
[09:48.48]Fuck.
[09:49.10]Now there is.
[09:49.44]Yeah, like... From here... Damn, would I look good in a Batman mask.
[09:56.06]You understand?
[09:57.20]Like, with the... Like, with this, like, covered... Like, I would be a great Batman.
[10:12.44]Your chin's too pointy?
[10:13.54]Time that person up for an hour.
[10:20.80]Ah, kidding.
[10:21.26]10 minutes.
[10:22.72]Alright, so the last thing we did... Uh... Do a Batman voice.
[10:33.11]Not gonna embarrass myself in the first 5 minutes of this one.
[10:36.09]Alright, so the last thing I did... Let's take a look at the map in the menu.
[10:42.17]I can go do this, which is the... How can I still do that?
[10:47.38]If I already completed that whole area, right?
[10:50.26]I can... Can I actually do this?
[11:00.79]I want to explore.
[11:01.47]Okay.
[11:02.07]Let me.
[11:02.31]I got to make.
[11:02.91]These are marked.
[11:04.31]Let's just do it.
[11:04.91]One.
[11:05.65]Two.
[11:05.91]I'm going to check this out.
[11:09.37]I want to.
[11:09.79]I want to look at this because I want to see from the mountain.
[11:12.69]I think I'm ready to go.
[11:13.45]We're on the mountain.
[11:14.22]This is where we are.
[11:14.96]Why is this marked?
[11:17.66]Oh, it's because it's a map thing.
[11:19.92]Alright.
[11:21.99]So, here we go.
[11:22.99]We're going to go to the left of us right now.
[11:27.21]Which is... How late are you going to stream?
[11:32.09]I don't know.
[11:32.55]I'm just going to play.
[11:35.79]I've been really, really active in the evening hours lately.
[11:38.65]Because of the last couple weeks.
[11:42.29]And I blame that on my sleep schedule kind of getting detonated after the streamer rewards.
[11:46.18]Because I had like a... ...politis slash proctitis flare-up that kind of fucked me up for a little while.
[11:53.38]So I'm kind of on a weird schedule at the moment.
[11:56.02]What?
[11:56.86]I'm awake.
[11:57.26]I'm alert now.
[11:57.92]Can I level up?
[12:00.38]I can.
[12:00.79]Shit.
[12:01.01]Alright.
[12:01.19]What am I going to do?
[12:06.19]He's a vampire.
[12:08.41]No, I'm not a vampire.
[12:12.03]I couldn't cut out.
[12:12.91]I wouldn't be cut out to be a vampire.
[12:17.03]Health.
[12:17.72]Health.
[12:20.57]You, okay, like drinking other people's blood?
[12:25.02]No.
[12:27.10]No, I... I don't even want to be... I don't even want to be near anybody else's blood.
[12:31.38]Ever.
[12:41.15]No one tell him.
[12:42.95]That's what a vampire would say.
[12:47.87]I don't- that's part of- that's a huge part of being a vampire, is drinking somebody else's blood.
[12:54.83]But it's not something I'm going to do.
[12:56.61]That's fucking- I don't like it.
[12:58.49]I don't like- no, I don't like blood.
[13:00.34]Nope.
[13:05.22]Werewolf?
[13:05.68]I would rather be a werewolf!
[13:07.14]A hundred times!
[13:09.60]Do I have to actually answer that question?
[13:11.08]Like, vampire, you- I mean, you get to live forever, but you have to drink other people's blood all the time.
[13:16.54]A werewolf, you get to, like, change into a werewolf.
[13:19.83]That's kind of cool, right?
[13:21.19]Like, I could just be, like, I could just hang out as me.
[13:23.75]And then there's a full moon.
[13:24.75]I just, like, and I'm, like, strong and shit.
[13:28.07]And, like, I'm really powerful.
[13:29.47]And I'm really smart, too.
[13:31.03]And I'm handsome.
[13:32.17]And I have a cool tail.
[13:33.73]And I, um, I can read it at least at 11th grade level.
[13:38.99]After I change.
[13:39.51]Alright, let's kill this guy.
[13:45.46]You got a lot of health.
[13:49.06]It's loud for me.
[13:50.62]Is it loud for you?
[13:52.42]Get off the horse.
[13:53.14]I can fight these guys off the horse.
[14:06.91]Furry.
[14:07.95]I did not say that.
[14:10.55]Wait, I have a question.
[14:13.35]Is a werewolf a furry?
[14:23.54]Yes, I don't think so.
[14:31.24]No, I don't think so.
[14:32.04]I think that's wrong.
[14:37.61]Get over here.
[14:55.37]How much health does he have?
[14:58.75]Ooh!
[15:00.17]That's a half-furry.
[15:02.55]Okay, for me, a furry is somebody that is an anthropomorphic animal person, right?
[15:09.12]That's kind of what it is.
[15:11.18]A werewolf is somebody that is like a person that changes into a wolf, like a wolf person at night.
[15:19.48]Are there furries that say I'm not a furry unless it's like 11 o'clock at night?
[15:22.57]That's, that's, no.
[15:30.58]Like, oh, okay, if you asked me if I was, like, a furry, like, at, like, 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and I said no.
[15:37.12]Then, like, at 10 o'clock at night, you said, are you a furry?
[15:39.14]And I was like, yeah, dude.
[15:40.74]That doesn't make any sense.
[15:51.33]Am I going to use an entire fucking floor to kill this guy?
[15:57.29]I'm just saying, what is that?
[15:59.46]What are the rules?
[16:00.14]I don't know what the rules are.
[16:09.31]A lot of luck on him.
[16:19.03]Huh?
[16:24.70]What do I put on the cat ears?
[16:25.88]Cat is not a werewolf.
[16:28.44]Sorry.
[16:28.80]I like... Sorry.
[16:30.86]I like a cat is not a werewolf.
[16:37.32]And I don't want to be, okay, let me clarify this, too.
[16:41.04]When I say I turn into a werewolf, like, if I was a werewolf, it's not like, oh, I'm just, like, kind of, like, get a little taller and I get some, like, scruff and I have ears now.
[16:48.99]No.
[16:49.59]Like, I'm going to be, like, a gnarled, like, fucking monster.
[16:53.19]You know what I mean?
[16:53.63]Like, fucking fucked up looking.
[16:56.95]Like, terrifying.
[16:58.43]Awful looking.
[17:07.52]I'm gonna get hunched, like, spine, like... Like, I'm not gonna be handsome looking.
[17:12.76]Let me be really clear about that.
[17:13.97]Is that... Did he drop anything?
[17:20.69]No.
[17:25.39]Like a blood-borne werewolf.
[17:26.83]Yes!
[17:28.30]That is exactly what I'm talking about.
[17:31.63]They're terrifying.
[17:33.11]When you turn into a werewolf, it's not like, oh, my shoulders get a little more broad.
[17:37.26]And my chin gets more defined.
[17:39.48]And I get a little snout and ears.
[17:42.30]And I'm like, look at me, though.
[17:44.16]Look at how handsome I am.
[17:44.88]No, no, no.
[17:45.28]I want to be one of the werewolves from fucking Bloodborne.
[17:51.90]Where am I going?
[17:52.38]I don't want to be able to talk, right?
[18:04.15]to me that's a werewolf like I don't want to change into this werewolf at night like no okay um let me think Dr. jekyll and Mr. hyde right like you did Mr. hyde you didn't want Mr. hyde like but at like midnight Mr. hyde was going to come out if he ate food after midnight that's the gremlins um who's the werewolf what am I what werewolf what werewolf am I talking about
[18:36.17]I know it's the fucking Gremlins I'm not like other furries
[18:53.67]Okay, well, I did want to look at this, so I'm here.
[18:57.02]I'm not like other- I'm not- I'm just saying I would rather- This all stemmed because somebody said, would you rather be a werewolf or a vampire?
[19:03.08]And I don't like the idea of drinking blood, so I would rather be a werewolf.
[19:10.03]But wait, werewolves- do werewolves eat people?
[19:13.37]I would still have to consume blood because I would be eating people.
[19:35.01]I don't know, I didn't think, I didn't think this would work really.
[19:44.40]Oh, that's bad.
[19:46.06]3D.
[19:54.01]Oh my god, these guys die in one hit.
[19:59.03]Oh fuck, that guy needs to die right now!
[20:01.23]I don't know why, I didn't think he was the same.
[20:09.24]Insane green.
[20:10.18]Fuck you.
[20:19.95]I... Oh my goodness.
[20:28.75]Oh my god, why can't I fucking dodge this guy?
[20:32.30]It's because this little dickhead is right next to him and it's like fucking up my timings.
[20:37.74]You were dead already, like an hour ago it seems.
[20:44.82]Why do I feel like this baby rattle lost 80% of its range overnight?
[20:48.37]What the fuck is going on here?
[20:55.39]I'm fucking furious right now, you have no idea.
[21:08.72]You are the stupidest fucking enemy in the goddamn game.
[21:12.60]Die already!
[21:13.38]I'm just used to eight potions.
[21:20.96]His face is red.
[21:22.24]It's always red.
[21:24.30]Don't make the werewolf come out!
[21:29.04]Yeah, don't feed me after midnight.
[21:31.02]When I get angry, I turn into a werewolf.
[21:33.08]It's not about the moon.
[21:33.86]It's not about, like, howling at the moon.
[21:38.06]Can I just be, like, four fictional characters combined?
[21:48.11]Now, that'd be a werewolf, but, like, with, like, a green Sonic the Hedgehog stripe up here.
[21:57.09]A gamma-radiated werewolf.
[22:00.23]Okay, fuck you.
[22:01.29]Hold on.
[22:07.64]Yeah, and I'm a Saiyan.
[22:13.32]Oh, die.
[22:21.06]OC.
[22:25.55]God, all those... You know, when I think of the Hulk...
[22:29.51]That would be so awful.
[22:30.59]Do you know how many times I just get fucking angry?
[22:33.77]It would be so bad, I would never be able to control it.
[22:35.93]Do you know how many times I've been in my car, just like fucking furious?
[22:41.21]Eventually turning into the Hulk in like your car?
[22:47.01]That would be so fucked up.
[22:50.94]Imagine you cut somebody off and they're like, hey!
[22:55.14]And then you're like, yeah, fuck you, buddy.
[22:56.54]You give him, like, the finger out the window.
[22:58.56]And then this person speeds by you, like, 15 seconds later.
[23:02.14]Their head is outside of the car, and they're big and green, and they're, like, coming after you.
[23:05.95]Ooh, what's that?
[23:23.54]Meltdown.
[23:24.06]Yeah, I would be, it would be bad.
[23:27.99]So many times where I just get so, just, I turn into, like, just Donald Duck.
[23:31.59]You know what I mean?
[23:32.17]Like, I just get so, just worked up.
[23:36.17]I would never be a good Hulk.
[23:42.58]He's shooting a bow and arrow at me.
[23:50.37]That's an invisible bridge.
[23:51.37]Just, hold on.
[23:56.12]Oh yeah, oh yeah, invisible Andy.
[23:57.40]Okay, yeah.
[23:57.88]100% that's an invisible bridge.
[24:01.12]Oh, invisible Andy, yeah.
[24:02.28]Game crashed.
[24:12.91]You guys crashed my fucking computer!
[24:26.65]What the fuck?
[24:30.09]What the fuck?
[24:36.07]It just actually crashed my whole computer.
[24:39.29]I'm stuck here.
[24:45.99]Okay, hold on a second.
[24:54.54]Oh, Jesus, this is bad.
[24:55.70]Alright, I'll be right back if the stream turns off.
[24:57.68]This is actually really bad.
[24:58.68]I can't even, like, get rid of this.
[25:05.21]I can't even- I can't alt-f4 the game either.
[25:06.83]Fuck, come on.
[25:12.71]It's doing that thing where my task manager is on the same screen as the fucking game, so I can't go to the task manager.
[25:21.56]I cannot go to my task manager.
[25:28.36]How do I get a tab?
[25:30.34]Windows key and tab.
[25:31.52]Yeah, let me... Oh, I got it!
[25:35.38]No, I didn't.
[25:35.76]It keeps going behind the game.
[25:38.02]Yeah, I pull it up.
[25:39.16]Okay, I think my whole computer's going down.
[25:40.72]The whole computer's going down.
[25:41.42]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[25:44.20]My whole computer's going down.
[25:46.84]The whole thing's coming down.
[25:47.58]I'll be back in a minute.
[25:56.17]Fuck, what?
[26:00.06]Dude, I can't get it.
[26:05.15]Windows tab and then like, I can't get it.
[26:10.87]No, I'm gonna have to restart the computer.
[26:13.99]I gotta hold the power button on.
[26:15.47]Use the arrow keys.
[26:16.89]I can't.
[26:20.01]Go look at the fucking invisible bridge.
[26:22.05]You invisible bridge Andes.
[26:24.60]I would have been fine.
[26:27.36]Windows key plus right.
[26:30.73]Oh, it's not doing anything.
[26:33.86]I can get it on my screen, but it immediately goes away.
[26:47.69]It's real tough.
[26:48.65]There's an option to have Task Manager always on top.
[26:52.03]Yeah, I mean... I just selected it.
[26:55.19]Oh my god, that person.
[26:56.63]Un-fucking-believable.
[26:58.18]You just saved the whole stream.
[27:01.19]Yeah, you just literally saved the stream.
[27:02.71]Okay, I'm coming back.
[27:03.77]We're good.
[27:10.20]You just actually saved the stream.
[27:13.92]Thank you.
[27:15.72]Well, I don't know how much progress we just... We didn't really progress that much, but that was weird.
[27:19.51]What the fuck?
[27:24.09]Kind of afraid to see where we end up now.
[27:32.19]Yeah, for those of you that want to know what I did, if you right-click in the task manager, like that little icon, you can say always on top, and it worked.
[27:44.47]What an absolute genius.
[27:46.91]Did you mod that guy?
[27:48.01]No.
[27:49.19]You should VIP him.
[27:50.67]I mean, that was pretty pog, but... We'll see if they have any other pog-related things in the near future.
[27:59.44]Oh, I want to show this, too.
[28:00.62]Hold on.
[28:02.10]Somebody actually made this.
[28:05.94]I need to see this.
[28:06.90]Remember yesterday when I did the comedy routine joke?
[28:10.90]Let's do that right now, actually.
[28:11.99]Because my Elden Ring is freaking out.
[28:14.25]It's like, I need to download the clouds.
[28:16.17]Hold on.
[28:19.83]Hi.
[28:19.91]I want to do this.
[28:26.45]Not that.
[28:29.57]I love how that's the last thing that was saved.
[28:30.85]These are really romantic candles.
[28:34.59]So I made a reference.
[28:36.65]Like the stupid candle routine was just essentially a comedy routine.
[28:42.66]So let's see how this plays out.
[28:45.34]These are really romantic candles.
[28:49.92]Oh, it probably stinks up here.
[28:55.57]Boss, I filled the room with red candles like you wanted.
[29:01.09]Gary, you fucking idiot.
[29:05.11]Did you have to get the red cinnamon apple candle from Yankee Candle and put it in every room?
[29:12.14]We're going to have to fucking open the windows and not come back here for like a week.
[29:15.00]By the way, that's one of the most powerful of all the candles, and I hate them.
[29:24.27]I swear to God, I can tell.
[29:27.19]I can tell when a neighbor lights one of those candles.
[29:31.38]It drives me crazy.
[29:36.10]It's like the fall cinnamon cider apple one.
[29:39.58]It's like, no.
[29:40.64]I like it for like a second, but I don't want to fill my whole neighborhood with that.
[29:53.20]that was uh Marie made that thank you Marie funny that was really funny don't you but you know what's weird old television shows and even current television shows they just like make you think that something was that funny when I just you almost the laugh track was sort of like I don't want to be left out kind of thing right
[30:18.47]Where it's like, you don't want to be left out because people are laughing at something.
[30:23.14]So if you don't laugh, it's like, fuck, I'm the only person not doing that.
[30:28.00]I guess I have to.
[30:33.14]I love knowing when to laugh.
[30:39.13]I have a video that plays a laugh track sometimes randomly during your streams.
[30:47.06]Somebody's called me a dumbass.
[30:48.52]Why?
[30:49.14]What the hell, man?
[30:50.76]Why?
[30:51.42]Dumbass?
[30:52.30]What the heck?
[30:56.01]Rue.
[30:56.59]What?
[30:56.91]I didn't do anything.
[30:58.29]Why do you think I'm a dumbass?
[30:59.31]Alright, I'm coming back.
[31:03.25]Hopefully this isn't fucking... I don't care if that's an invisible bridge.
[31:07.58]I'm not going over there.
[31:14.34]Okay, I'm already getting shot by an arrow.
[31:17.82]Wait, that's it.
[31:18.32]I don't want to look at that.
[31:19.96]I am terrified to actually go look at that.
[31:25.50]Oh, you got a shirt change.
[31:26.38]Yeah.
[31:28.24]Alright, let me get my bearings for a second.
[31:29.58]What the fuck is happening?
[31:34.81]Alright.
[31:36.45]I don't want... If it's going to crash the game, I'm scared to go over there.
[31:40.15]The game crashed there too.
[31:42.41]It should be fine now.
[32:04.51]There should be a lean down button on the horse.
[32:08.43]Just get off.
[32:14.64]Alright.
[32:20.22]What's going on?
[32:21.16]Look at how weird this looks.
[32:22.35]Something's wrong here.
[32:24.25]Already, there's something weird with the shadows.
[32:26.31]I don't- No, this is fucking up.
[32:27.35]Look at- Something's wrong with this bro- I don't wanna be here.
[32:34.34]Look at how fucked up like the triangle shadows and shit.
[32:37.00]Something's wrong over here.
[32:42.14]Run.
[32:42.60]Run!
[32:44.22]Dude.
[32:47.18]Is there actually an invisible bridge here?
[32:48.80]This whole area feels like broken.
[33:01.35]I thought the game crashed.
[33:03.49]I thought the game crashed.
[33:05.09]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[33:07.83]So it wasn't bullshit.
[33:09.81]Wait.
[33:15.69]I need rainbow stones.
[33:25.63]I have a shitload, don't I?
[33:30.18]I have nine.
[33:30.98]I can make way more than that.
[33:35.12]Okay, here we go.
[33:53.08]What if it ends?
[33:53.82]It's just gonna fucking end.
[34:07.18]Where does this go?
[34:07.92]Can I throw them?
[34:16.91]I'm so afraid that it's gonna end.
[34:25.67]Okay.
[34:26.95]I think I'm already falling off.
[34:34.58]Holy shit.
[34:35.50]I can't go that way either.
[34:39.22]What?
[34:49.84]Alright, we can go this way.
[34:56.45]Oh, fuck.
[35:03.47]I'm gonna run out of these things.
[35:06.35]I think I'm gonna run out.
[35:12.20]What?
[35:14.96]People are laughing at me.
[35:15.92]You lost on a straight line?
[35:18.59]What?
[35:19.05]What do you mean?
[35:19.61]I couldn't go that way.
[35:21.23]What do you mean?
[35:30.40]It gets... What?
[35:31.62]Did I get... Are you sure?
[35:36.16]Why was I gonna fall off over there?
[35:58.06]Am I stupid?
[35:59.84]Just go, just go.
[36:02.96]What happened there?
[36:04.52]It goes straight, stop.
[36:06.64]You're fucking lying.
[36:10.30]You're a liar.
[36:15.14]Oh, why does this?
[36:19.97]Okay, I think I got it.
[36:21.11]So it's only, okay, it's, it's, I get it, okay, I understand.
[36:27.45]Alright, now I'm afraid.
[36:28.27]Does this turn left?
[36:48.99]It probably turns left here.
[36:57.79]There's no way it leads right here.
[36:58.91]It's going to go that way.
[36:59.61]Okay.
[37:07.02]Yeah.
[37:07.32]Just run forward.
[37:08.34]Just run forward and die.
[37:09.36]Hopefully, I don't think those things... Hopefully, these things are not used for anything else.
[37:35.78]Yeah.
[37:36.12]It's a straight line, Jerma.
[37:37.55]It's a straight line.
[37:38.97]You don't know how to run in a straight line?
[37:40.33]What the fuck?
[37:42.01]What?
[38:05.48]I see, I know I have to go there, but I'm afraid of just going there.
[38:10.01]What keeps happening?
[38:26.38]Alright, this is an invisible wall then?
[38:31.78]It's not.
[38:48.54]This is not an invisible wall.
[39:03.09]What the fuck am I supposed to do about this?
[39:08.03]I can't make that jump from here.
[39:12.22]Hit it multiple times.
[39:13.24]There's nothing here, man.
[39:19.25]Why is there an invisible bridge that leads into a wall?
[39:21.09]I don't know.
[39:21.71]This has to be a reason.
[39:28.81]Really?
[39:29.47]What's the point?
[39:50.08]What?
[39:57.76]Look for the mist?
[40:08.69]Oh shit!
[40:28.46]Whoa.
[40:28.78]Do these stay permanently?
[40:34.06]It looks like a Christmas decoration.
[40:46.71]Alright, I'm gonna put one here just so I remember that I can actually do this.
[40:50.19]I'm gonna put one back there because I want to make sure I know that I can actually do this.
[40:53.01]Alright.
[40:54.29]Well, that was fucking cool.
[40:57.12]The seal on the rise opened.
[41:03.10]Oh, I need a bonfire or something.
[41:05.26]I can't believe you actually did an invisible bridge.
[41:23.11]I thought you guys were fucking with me.
[41:33.59]Alright, let's go up.
[41:40.22]Hold on.
[41:41.26]I gotta move this.
[41:47.03]Oh!
[41:48.75]Up.
[41:50.07]I need a place to heal or something.
[41:51.65]This is probably like Memory Stone or something.
[41:56.01]He almost growled at us.
[42:02.30]Memory stone.
[42:03.26]All these rises have sorcery stuff, so... Why would we ever fuck with you?
[42:12.57]I don't know.
[42:14.31]You crashed my... You crashed my computer like 20 minutes ago.
[42:18.69]I'm holding you responsible for everything else going forward.
[42:27.60]Ooh, Memory Stone, right?
[42:28.84]It has to be.
[42:29.76]That's a legendary Memory Stone.
[42:32.18]Founding Rain of Stars.
[42:41.63]Releases a Downpour of Star Rain for a while.
[42:48.13]Sorcery of Legendary Status.
[42:51.07]Summons a dark cloud of stars overhead.
[42:52.65]Shortly after, the cloud will release a violent deluge of star rain.
[42:56.33]This sorcery can be cast while in motion.
[42:58.83]About to be the founding glintstone sorcery.
[43:06.02]Alright.
[43:07.20]I'll try it.
[43:07.62]It's a golden legendary.
[43:09.98]Yeah, that's cool.
[43:14.42]I'll check it out.
[43:17.04]Alright, I gotta mark this.
[43:20.27]So, sword means I did it.
[43:21.95]And, like, did the thing in there.
[43:23.01]I started to try to do that before.
[43:27.91]But, I gotta start doing that.
[43:29.26]Because I will look at the map and go, What's this?
[43:31.42]Heretical Rise?
[43:32.18]What's that thing?
[43:35.04]That's cool.
[43:35.42]Alright.
[43:35.76]So, let me... I can just leave from here.
[43:38.16]Is there... There's gotta be a bonfire somewhere.
[43:41.44]In this building.
[43:42.00]Alright.
[43:47.04]Alright.
[43:53.67]Uh... Yeah, when I... People asking, like, what's with the Boston accent?
[43:58.37]Anytime... I mean, if Starlight's in the inventory, then, like, it's gonna come out.
[44:03.42]Like, if I have... If I got Starlight in my pocket, like, I can... It'll come out.
[44:10.10]Because, wow, when this comes off, if I replace, um... If I replace Starlight, then it'll probably go away.
[44:16.65]I apologize, like, in advance.
[44:17.73]I'm sorry.
[44:19.03]Fucking hate it.
[44:32.14]Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:33.34]I forgot about that.
[44:34.64]I want to do that too.
[44:37.62]I want to go get the Remembrance.
[44:40.20]So I can do cold sorceresses.
[44:47.50]That was part of the plan too.
[44:53.55]Wait, is that a painting?
[44:59.07]No, it's not.
[45:01.02]You know, okay, I've got a disappointment.
[45:03.72]I've got one disappointment for you.
[45:08.63]Falling snow marks something unseen.
[45:10.59]Oh, I did this backwards.
[45:14.73]I just went completely in reverse.
[45:17.60]Okay, well, that's weird.
[45:20.51]I've got an Elden Ring complaint for you, and it's not a complaint as much as it's I wish there were more.
[45:26.17]I thought there were going to be way more of those hidden kind of area painting things.
[45:31.39]They're some of my favorite parts of the entire game.
[45:34.41]I wish there was a ton of them.
[45:37.03]Going to find that one little spot is so cool.
[45:40.30]It's so fun.
[45:41.80]It's so much more like reason to kind of go explore.
[45:43.70]There's like six in the game.
[45:47.86]That I've found so far.
[45:48.86]And there's probably like 10 to 12 in the game total.
[45:52.68]I wish there was like 30.
[45:58.89]I love that.
[45:59.97]I love trying to find that one little spot.
[46:01.93]Okay, this... My computer is not happy.
[46:05.61]My computer is not happy right now.
[46:07.05]Here.
[46:07.21]This area is really just like... My computer hates it.
[46:15.48]I need a bonfire.
[46:16.70]So bad.
[46:22.17]I come, it's actually pretty good.
[46:27.61]No horse, Andy.
[46:28.43]I'm just exploring.
[46:37.54]Oh, shit.
[46:38.16]This is going to take me down here.
[46:39.18]I don't want to do that yet.
[46:42.02]Maybe I'll get the map fragment.
[46:44.90]Yeah, let me get the map.
[46:45.74]Just let me get the map fragment.
[46:47.08]I'll come back.
[46:54.86]That looks suspicious over there.
[46:58.74]There are seven paintings?
[47:01.28]I've done like four or five.
[47:03.84]How many?
[47:04.02]We've done like, what, four?
[47:05.12]That's pretty sus over there, it is.
[47:08.32]Don't stop making me say that.
[47:21.81]Alright.
[47:24.73]Seriously?
[47:25.15]Need a... ...Montfire.
[47:29.49]Because I want to go get the Remembrance.
[47:31.21]From, um... Rinella.
[47:32.87]Are you wearing red because you're the Impostor?
[47:40.75]Yes!
[47:41.25]Um... Alright.
[47:56.04]Worst noise.
[47:57.22]So clip it and put it in your inbox or something for later this year.
[48:03.38]I'm not going to tell you what you can and cannot nominate.
[48:05.26]Yeah, I'll get the map fragment.
[48:16.05]I'm very curious.
[48:19.15]What was that?
[48:19.99]I don't know.
[48:23.43]Oh, ever go.
[48:26.37]Everjail.
[48:28.85]Lord Contender's Everjail.
[48:31.21]Uh, should we just go here and get our... Is there a statue here?
[48:34.01]Because I don't want to do this unless there is.
[48:36.49]Is there a statue?
[48:39.83]There is right here.
[48:41.15]Okay.
[48:42.57]But yeah, let's just go loose.
[48:47.48]Look under your HP bar.
[48:50.48]Oh, right, yeah.
[48:53.58]Okay, let me try it.
[48:54.20]This is a boss.
[48:56.14]Let's go.
[49:09.56]Round table, knight, pike?
[49:11.04]I don't know what that does.
[49:15.64]What's he doing?
[49:46.36]Hey, what?
[49:47.40]An actual named boss can drink a potion?
[49:50.36]With a bar at the bottom?
[49:53.53]I don't think I've seen that.
[49:54.81]Oh fuck.
[50:34.45]Oh!
[50:37.65]He's trying to drink another potion.
[50:44.11]Oh, don't be gritty!
[51:00.18]Oh, fuck.
[51:04.52]What a clean finish.
[51:16.55]Bikes Dragonbolt.
[51:20.29]Fingerprint Helm?
[51:24.38]That was a clean fight.
[51:28.58]Somebody just said, where is that?
[51:30.34]I'll show you right now.
[51:33.76]It is in the mountaintop of Giants.
[51:36.28]Looks like along this road that comes down here.
[51:38.20]I don't have the map fragment, sorry.
[51:40.19]It's this Everjail.
[51:41.05]Lord Contender's Everjail.
[51:45.13]Um, what is that stuff?
[51:51.77]Bolster's right hand...
[51:54.20]Armament and body with red lightning.
[51:57.80]Enchantment with lightning affinity attacks and increases maximum equipment load.
[52:00.43]What?
[52:01.29]That's weird.
[52:25.58]This is THE FromSoftware armor?
[52:27.78]What do you mean?
[52:30.38]Fingerprint armor.
[52:40.79]Fingerprint armor.
[52:43.92]Iron armor signed and blistered by fingers.
[52:47.36]Worn by Vyke, Knight of the Roundtable Hold.
[52:49.50]No other Tarnus was closer to the throne of the Elden Lord than Vyke.
[52:53.22]But without an announcement, Vyke traveled far below the capital and was scorched by the flame of frenzy.
[52:59.09]Did he make his choice for his maiden, or did some other force lure him with suggestion?
[53:06.71]Oh, this is Box Art Andy.
[53:09.29]Really?
[53:11.42]Is it?
[53:15.50]Box Art Andy.
[53:19.96]Okay.
[53:21.72]This helm is potentially better than what I have on.
[53:25.12]But it doesn't boost sorceries.
[53:31.05]Is this the box art?
[53:31.81]I thought the box art had kind of hair coming back.
[53:37.21]Old goat gauntlets?
[53:38.25]What the fuck are these?
[53:45.95]Fingerprint greaves.
[53:48.70]Alright, I like my setup right now.
[53:52.40]Raging wolf armor is the box art armor.
[53:54.14]Yeah, I thought that box art had hair out there.
[53:56.71]You're using the trailer armor.
[54:00.63]That was cool.
[54:01.37]That's a cool spell too.
[54:02.27]I wonder if it's any good.
[54:04.23]But it's a FromSoftware game, so no, it's not going to be.
[54:08.43]That'll go on the list of, like... Okay, FromSoftware, like, spell tier list.
[54:14.05]Let's say we have S, A, B, and whatever.
[54:17.90]Literally, A, B, C, and D don't matter.
[54:20.80]There's, like, five moves that are at S, and then 70 that are at Do Not Equip.
[54:25.66]Like, at the very bottom, like, under F. So, probably looks cool.
[54:39.41]You should equip a branch.
[54:40.92]I got 100,000 souls.
[54:42.24]This could get ugly real quick.
[54:43.80]I need a... I need a bonfire.
[54:47.59]Min-max handy.
[54:50.47]Um... I mean, I'm obviously just, you know, taking a piss.
[54:54.07]But...
[54:56.96]Oh, fuck, not these.
[54:59.43]Uh, yeah, but whenever I get a new spell, it seems, I'll be like, oh, dude, star shards from outer space!
[55:06.55]And the sea of chat is just like, ah, no, dude, they're worthless.
[55:09.29]It's, like, fucking awful.
[55:10.29]It takes, like, 80% of your mana bar, and it does, like, 12 damage.
[55:13.26]It's like, oh.
[55:13.92]Okay.
[55:19.64]Oh!
[55:20.42]Glint blade of the distressed soldier!
[55:23.22]Nah, dude, don't even put it on.
[55:27.08]It's way too slow.
[55:28.94]And just swinging your regular weapon will hurt for more.
[55:31.08]Alright.
[55:39.55]Okay, I guess.
[55:40.55]Alright, I'm gonna die from one of these.
[55:42.21]Get on the road.
[55:48.62]Ooh, what's this?
[55:50.38]Thank you.
[55:57.18]Although it's fun to have, like, the sorceries and then some of the incantations.
[56:00.20]They're cool.
[56:04.19]Founding stars is OP, though.
[56:05.65]Is it?
[56:13.83]You should talk to... Wait, can I talk?
[56:17.87]I can, alright.
[56:18.98]Shh!
[56:24.16]We're almost there.
[56:25.84]The flame of ruin lies just ahead.
[56:28.16]Just ahead?
[56:28.78]I'm glad it was you I traveled with.
[56:31.82]I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too.
[56:35.17]Thank you, Torrent.
[56:37.35]Please continue to lend your aid.
[56:40.37]Till the end.
[56:43.13]There is something I'd like to say.
[56:45.77]My purpose was given to me by my mother.
[56:49.16]But now...
[56:51.14]I act of my own volition.
[56:53.98]I have set my heart upon the world that I would have, regardless of my mother's designs.
[57:01.30]This is America's daughter.
[57:02.21]I won't allow anyone to speak ill of that.
[57:06.39]Not even you.
[57:07.19]I mean, it is, right?
[57:23.50]Can you talk to her again?
[57:34.20]I don't think so.
[57:37.02]Oh, right.
[57:37.44]I want to try that new move.
[57:38.63]Let's see.
[57:39.25]Come on, FromSoftware.
[57:40.23]Give me a move that's not swift boring glint blade.
[57:44.87]Swift pebble stone.
[57:47.19]That works and is good.
[57:51.05]Can't take that off.
[58:07.09]it takes two slots alright a hundred and how much fp does it cost to do this
[58:36.86]That lasted a long time.
[58:40.74]Okay.
[58:42.38]Let's test it out on this unsuspecting loser right here.
[58:47.02]Hey, just stand right here for me, if you will.
[58:59.03]Hmm, it's okay.
[59:01.19]It's alright.
[59:06.80]I mean, it's... Actually, that would be really good if the group is chasing you around.
[59:10.54]Yeah, I did.
[59:12.00]I charged it.
[59:17.31]Let's just aggro everybody and see what happens.
[59:26.72]Alright, let's go.
[59:27.26]Like, fucking run around.
[59:29.00]Somebody come and get me.
[59:35.75]Shit, that kind of hurts my eyes.
[59:39.37]Probably good for stationary large bosses.
[59:45.13]That's true.
[59:45.73]I'll leave it on.
[59:48.12]It hits large enemies a lot.
[59:50.18]Okay.
[59:50.32]Okay.
[59:55.76]It doesn't actually take that much mana, as much as I thought it was going to.
[59:58.32]I thought it was going to be a lot more.
[60:04.18]It's a cool spell.
[60:05.90]I like it.
[60:06.24]Charge it.
[60:11.71]I am.
[60:12.37]I've charged it every time.
[60:14.27]Do you want me to prove it to you?
[60:25.01]I've been doing that every time.
[60:30.88]Kind of like a dot.
[60:32.36]Okay, here's why I'm going to keep it on.
[60:34.18]Its surface area is actually huge.
[60:36.38]And it lasts a very, very long time.
[60:39.94]It doesn't take that long to cast it either.
[60:41.65]So I think it could be supplemental.
[60:46.18]Um, she just said that, like, this is the end of the game coming up here.
[60:50.05]She's like, oh, here it is.
[60:51.17]This is right ahead.
[60:52.25]Right?
[60:53.77]I'm kind of afraid to do this right now.
[60:57.27]Right?
[60:57.69]Like, I don't want to do this.
[60:58.73]I don't want to end the game.
[60:59.71]Oh.
[61:06.30]Oh.
[61:33.14]Okay.
[61:34.44]Alright, I don't hate it.
[61:36.32]I actually think it's kind of good.
[61:37.06]Okay.
[61:53.52]Ooh, it hurt.
[62:07.66]Oh!
[62:30.66]Oh!
[62:49.25]I thought I fell off the cliff.
[62:52.27]Why did I just have an accent?
[62:54.55]Why did I just have like a fucking Italian accent?
[63:12.49]Off!
[63:14.15]Okay, damn!
[63:15.49]I don't know why, I just had like a- I had like a European accent for a second there.
[63:21.30]What was that?
[63:21.72]Alright, don't just run around.
[63:29.98]What's going on with my voice?
[63:31.90]It's because I have two headphones in.
[63:36.77]I have to- I can't hear myself talk, so like, it's weird.
[63:45.57]Holy shit, what is that thing?
[63:50.57]Get- walk over here!
[63:55.87]Oh god.
[63:56.45]This bullshit.
[64:09.83]Huh?
[64:12.07]Why did it turn off?
[64:12.83]I can't cast it multiple times?
[64:17.93]I want it to rain down on these motherfuckers.
[64:28.54]It was patched.
[64:33.34]Was it actually?
[64:36.88]Can't cast two of them.
[64:37.90]Yeah, that's kinda bad.
[64:42.34]I need to swap out some stuff because I'm doing too much, like, click click click click click click click click click click.
[64:56.03]The Erdtree.
[65:05.75]Okay.
[65:07.57]Ah.
[65:08.78]Chest.

[66:12.67]Alright.
[66:32.21]Truly amazing.
[66:42.62]What is that?
[66:42.96]What?
[66:45.18]Moonlight spell?
[66:48.88]How did you get the Moonblade?
[66:51.02]Uh, it was... I forget.
[66:54.29]Oh, no!
[66:54.89]It's from the dragon.
[66:57.66]It's from the glint stone dragon that's in front of, um, that hangs around the Ranni's, um, and the rises, right?
[67:07.01]It's from the magic dragon.
[67:12.59]Keep going.
[67:13.63]I want the map fragment.
[67:17.77]Almost there.
[67:20.95]These are weird.
[67:21.97]These little, um, statue-like things.
[67:27.97]Oh, God damn it.
[67:28.95]Where is the map fragment?
[67:33.69]It's not all the way down there, right?
[67:35.04]Oh, it's right there, isn't it?
[67:39.26]There's a... No, okay.
[67:48.48]It's probably right here.
[67:49.10]Yeah, it's right there.
[67:52.94]Jesus.
[67:58.13]Are these guys alive?
[67:58.77]They're not.
[68:03.57]Oh, I thought that was one of those ghost people to talk to.
[68:05.42]This is a rock.
[68:07.68]I didn't skip the castle!
[68:09.00]No, no, no, no, no.
[68:09.72]I'm coming here to get the map fragment first.
[68:15.92]I'm... I just want the map fragment.
[68:19.26]There we go.
[68:20.22]Alright.
[68:20.94]Now I can see what the hell is going on here.
[68:24.81]Alright.
[68:26.37]So this is where... This looks... What is that?
[68:28.87]I don't know.
[68:31.49]But... I'm not skipping this.
[68:34.29]I just wanted the map.
[68:35.11]So I could see where the hell I was.
[68:36.96]There's also something really interesting here.
[68:40.72]Which is what we're going to look at.
[68:42.48]I'm going to go do the fort here.
[68:48.42]Is there a random Mohg-like enemy incoming?
[68:50.22]Okay.
[68:55.53]Okay.
[68:57.13]I'm gonna go in there.
[68:57.95]No!
[69:01.11]No.
[69:02.41]That's not what we're doing.
[69:07.45]Where's the... Where's the bell place?
[69:13.28]It's like here somewhere, right?
[69:15.98]I want that remembrance because I want that stuff.
[69:21.58]Where is it?
[69:24.30]Hurry up and tell me!
[69:25.73]Where is it?
[69:27.25]Northeast Lake.
[69:28.49]Fucking hurry up.
[69:30.58]When I ask something, I expect there to be something in the fucking chat immediately.
[69:35.62]None of this, like, talking, talking, like, hanging out, having fun.
[69:38.98]No, when I ask something, fucking answer it.
[69:40.34]Fucking unbelievable.
[69:47.41]Where was it?
[69:48.07]Where was- I didn't even see it.
[69:52.29]Stop spamming the chat.
[69:57.15]I quit.
[69:57.45]I'm quitting tomorrow.
[69:58.63]I quit.
[69:59.55]I quit tomorrow.
[70:01.39]Where's the eastern part of the lake?
[70:09.17]Worst face?
[70:10.63]Werewolf face.
[70:11.41]I'm sorry.
[70:11.77]The moon.
[70:12.19]The moon's up.
[70:14.79]Northeast.
[70:15.23]I'm just going to go here.
[70:27.42]Northeast next to the castle.
[70:28.72]I like right over here around.
[70:33.38]I'll just go look around for it.
[70:34.84]Yeah, it's like right here.
[70:37.82]It was walking around here.
[70:42.20]You've changed.
[70:43.63]I know.
[70:44.77]I know.
[70:45.17]It's like I just hate being here.
[70:58.39]Alright, would you guys, let me ask you a question, those who are the viewers, right?
[71:03.32]Would that be, okay, if I was like that, would that be funny?
[71:07.18]Would you be watching to watch me have like a meltdown?
[71:10.16]Is that like funny?
[71:11.94]Or like, would you like not, would you be like, nah, I don't want to watch this guy.
[71:15.76]This guy likes a fucking dick.
[71:17.04]He just like always hates like streaming.
[71:23.18]Hey!
[71:24.98]Who did that?
[71:25.58]Oh.
[71:28.01]Depends on if it's a joke.
[71:29.57]Yeah.
[71:33.03]I'd be sad.
[71:33.81]No, it's never gonna get there.
[71:40.98]Don't worry.
[71:41.40]You guys already know.
[71:43.24]The minute that I'm not having a good time anymore, it's like, alright, that's it.
[71:47.62]That's it, right?
[71:48.30]Like, that's it.
[71:49.86]That's not, don't worry.
[71:53.90]I would subscribe for, like, meltdowns, would you?
[71:59.97]Well, I think I already do that.
[72:01.85]North... Like, up here?
[72:04.93]Did I... I feel like it's not over here.
[72:10.66]Is it even further up here?
[72:15.40]East.
[72:17.78]Literally, you literally looked at it.
[72:21.14]Northeast of Ray Lucario.
[72:25.09]Here.
[72:25.29]Right over here?
[72:31.57]to the east just staring at it.
[72:33.03]Oh, but like my view distance is low.
[72:41.28]Alright, there it is.
[72:43.90]I actually haven't made this one sit down.
[72:47.62]Did I?
[72:47.90]Yeah, I made the other one sit down.
[72:49.08]There's a lot of fucking people here.
[72:54.50]Your IRL view distance?
[72:56.62]Yeah.
[73:04.09]This one's not moving.
[73:08.45]I feel like my head in the bell.
[73:11.16]There's nothing to brush off either.
[73:14.80]I have to do something else.
[73:33.15]Yeah, ring the bell.
[73:33.81]That's what I'm gonna try.
[73:45.38]I don't think I can hit it.
[74:01.99]Um...
[74:07.01]There's a dungeon over here that I didn't do.
[74:09.07]Ah, me strong will do it.
[74:13.07]Alright, except, what about the people that are around the bell?
[74:14.93]Maybe if I aggro the people that are around the bell?
[74:20.19]Right?
[74:20.51]That makes sense.
[74:23.77]Alright, so just like, okay, here it goes.
[74:25.21]I'm like whacking the spirits over here.
[74:26.61]And you can hear the screams of the spirits.
[74:39.02]Do I have to jump on it?
[74:41.54]How the fuck am I supposed to jump on it?
[74:59.66]From here?
[75:00.06]From up there?
[75:09.78]Teleport to this Grace above.
[75:11.10]Like, up here, you mean.
[75:18.28]It's bugged?
[75:25.47]Eh.
[75:27.69]It's supposed to be moving.
[75:35.80]Huh?
[75:56.97]Give me the item!
[76:00.52]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[76:08.08]So I have to jump from up here?
[76:11.12]We're going down together!
[76:23.80]How am I supposed to land on that?
[76:30.19]I don't understand.
[76:30.91]How am I supposed to land on that?
[76:31.75]Okay.
[76:36.73]Is it like one of those?
[76:37.39]Is this soft?
[76:38.77]Wait.
[76:39.25]I already have one of these right here.
[76:40.57]I can just use this one.
[76:54.26]Okay.
[76:55.26]Cool.
[76:58.44]Oh.
[76:59.34]Oh.
[77:17.94]I need the other one.
[77:22.58]How am I supposed to get onto that?
[77:23.94]I definitely... It's probably a jump from here and you can... It's probably soft enough on top where it doesn't kill you.
[77:28.94]But if it does, just know that this is an experiment.
[77:31.72]Somebody said it's bugged.
[77:34.24]It's supposed to be moving.
[77:35.22]But, I mean, would the game really be this bugged over and over again after loading like three times?
[77:46.50]Kill that guy real quick.
[77:47.32]Alright, it's a clear.
[77:50.22]It is moving.
[77:50.82]Fuck, it was bugged.
[77:54.79]It was bugged.
[77:56.81]Come on.
[77:57.41]Does it only move in certain times of the day?
[78:01.65]Oh my god.
[78:05.81]I can't make it from here.
[78:07.11]So we're gonna have to go back to where I was.
[78:08.87]They sleep at night.
[78:19.01]Well, let me make sure it's daytime.
[78:20.65]Like right in the middle of noon or whatever.
[78:22.69]How about your runes?
[78:38.41]I don't get out of bed for less than 50k.
[78:52.61]It was 45.
[78:52.87]Not what I said.
[79:03.19]I'll get them, don't worry.
[79:03.99]Have you ever played Ocarina of Time?
[79:10.17]Oh yeah.
[79:11.89]I played Ocarina of Time when it came out.
[79:15.25]I remember sitting there playing.
[79:16.39]In my bedroom.
[79:20.57]The game had just released, and I was like, holy shit, this is crazy.
[79:31.52]Old.
[79:32.12]I mean, yeah, I was old.
[79:40.10]I mean, I am old.
[79:41.53]I don't know, how old was I?
[79:43.01]When did I come out, like 1996 or something?
[79:49.30]Okay, so how does this work?
[79:50.46]1998.
[79:53.10]24 years ago?
[79:53.58]24, 25 years ago?
[79:56.41]I was... 14?
[79:57.83]13? 13?
[80:13.60]I don't know.
[80:16.40]Alright, so how do I do this now?
[80:17.88]Does it have a dunk on it?
[80:32.21]Oh, you piece of shit.
[80:33.51]It's going that way.
[80:34.43]Do I have to jump from here, right?
[80:40.61]Yes, I definitely have to jump from right here.
[80:44.41]It's gonna keep walking.
[80:45.47]Oh, god.
[80:51.53]I was just over there.
[80:52.78]So, it's like here.
[81:07.92]Five.
[81:09.30]Okay.
[81:09.80]Alright.
[81:12.95]Get the runes, too.
[81:16.82]Stop.
[81:17.16]What?
[81:18.78]What?
[81:25.67]I can't get it from here?
[81:26.37]This kills me.
[81:27.71]I'm gonna be pissed.
[81:31.17]Alright, my runes are right here.
[81:33.15]Let's get those.
[81:34.07]And then I have to jump from like over there.
[81:39.78]There.
[81:59.34]Right there.
[82:20.20]Fuck you!
[82:21.40]I'm so... I just wanna get there now!
[82:25.48]You know what I mean?
[82:26.02]Like, I don't wanna, like... I wanna just fucking get there!
[82:30.92]I don't wanna just do this!
[82:32.04]Get me there now!
[82:33.32]Right now!
[82:36.11]God damn it!
[82:40.13]It's not from the cliff?
[82:43.55]What do you mean?
[82:46.17]It's not the cliff.
[82:47.41]What the fuck?
[83:00.61]It is from the cliff.
[83:01.63]Minus 45k.
[83:02.77]I don't... At this point, I don't care.
[83:05.65]I'll go get him in a minute.
[83:07.63]Shift sprint spring on the lake?
[83:10.81]What is a sprint spring?
[83:13.29]Is this Sonic the Hedgehog?
[83:14.58]What's a sprint spring?
[83:17.47]Sprint spring?
[83:25.30]Horse jump.
[83:26.24]That's- you should just say horse jump.
[83:27.76]Sprint spring does- uh, no.
[83:29.48]It's a horse jump.
[83:30.80]Horse jump.
[83:43.34]It's fucking midnight!
[84:09.85]I didn't think this was gonna take this long to go get this stupid remembrance.
[84:18.25]If I had known this was gonna take this long, I would have just fucking burnt the Erdtree by now.

[85:30.69]I'm ready to move on from this.
[85:31.90]Before I freak out.
[85:36.62]Meat grinder ending.
[85:37.72]There's never been a good ending in a Souls game.
[85:41.51]That, yeah.
[85:43.07]That's... Alright, so where's this spring pad?
[85:54.63]I don't see a spring pad.
[85:56.01]Don't rush me.
[85:59.63]Spring pad.
[86:01.74]Oh, there it is.
[86:02.66]There's the sprint spring.
[86:14.93]Alright, now get over here.
[86:17.35]What time is it?
[86:18.07]What time is it?
[86:18.69]What time is it?
[86:19.43]What time is it?
[86:19.99]What time is it?
[86:24.11]No!
[86:24.71]I thought it was stopping.
[86:33.89]Jump on him with the spring?
[86:35.17]You are full of shit!
[86:48.66]You are full of shit!
[86:56.14]Get over here!
[87:01.66]Just wait?
[87:59.25]Have you fought the Fallen?
[88:01.13]Yeah, I killed it in one hit.
[88:17.77]You can double jump?
[88:18.59]Can I?
[88:39.71]He's close, he's closer, he's closer.
[88:41.09]Okay, he's close.
[88:49.55]Oh my god!
[88:50.73]I can't... Why are you not over here yet?
[89:00.50]Why do you take so long to get over here?
[89:02.22]You're not going the other way, right?
[89:11.06]Alright, for everyone telling me to look at its feet... That's not how you do this one.
[89:16.62]This motherfucker is right there, alright?
[89:30.27]This motherfucker is right there.
[89:31.27]You were lying to me.
[89:32.15]It's not the jump.
[89:40.59]You were lying to me.
[89:42.37]It's over there.
[89:42.79]Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[89:47.40]You were literally lying to my face.
[90:12.55]What happened?
[90:29.00]Why did that happen?
[90:30.40]I have to wait again.
[90:38.05]I have to go from the lower one.
[90:39.47]Ayy.
[90:40.27]Okay.
[90:40.85]I'm gonna give this five more minutes before I fucking eat this controller.
[90:43.43]God damn it.
[90:54.60]So we- just- okay, I- so I was right.
[90:56.94]Who needs the thing?
[90:58.02]I could go from here.
[91:00.44]I actually could go from here.
[91:02.48]You guys, I had it right from the very beginning.
[91:07.83]No, no, you gotta go down.
[91:09.25]Let me explain what you guys told me to do.
[91:13.12]You gotta go down to the lake to jump up from the spirit jump to where you are already standing.
[91:25.09]I was already there.
[91:35.38]Like, I would get to this edge, and there were those gravestones.
[91:37.74]Remember, I died from them.
[91:38.86]And you guys were like, no, dude, you're fucking stupid.
[91:41.55]You're a fucking idiot.
[91:42.71]This is wrong.
[91:43.83]And I'm like, is it wrong?
[91:44.77]What do you mean?
[91:45.25]No, you gotta go down to go up to where you are.
[91:49.23]Huh?
[91:53.97]What?
[91:57.74]Okay, so it's over here.
[91:59.90]Wait, where am I?
[92:01.56]Why is it so foggy?
[92:16.52]Down there.
[92:17.04]There, there, there, there, there.
[92:18.14]Here, here.
[92:21.54]See?
[92:23.10]Look at all this shit.
[92:24.38]I have to go right there.
[92:27.05]Okay, don't.
[92:28.35]See?
[92:28.71]That's where I was going.
[92:29.69]And everybody told me you go- Don't fucking rush it!
[92:33.27]Don't rush it!
[92:34.51]I've rushed it!
[92:35.55]I've rushed it!
[92:36.55]I've rushed- I'm gonna quit the game.
[92:38.62]Okay.
[92:40.84]I'm just- Okay.
[92:42.36]Let's fucking get a trainer.
[92:43.76]And just get the resemblance.
[92:46.45]do this again I don't want to do this the 15th time this is requires patience I just need patience man I just need patience just I'm gonna do it whatever okay I'm gonna go from here I'm gonna go up the thing this is so fucking easy I just don't want to spend the five minutes to wait for his slow ass to go over to the edge why can't I just fucking punch him why can't I just
[93:14.52]This resemblance better be worth it.
[93:16.18]Otherwise, I'm going to be pissed.
[93:21.26]This dude can't even jump on a building.
[93:23.34]I did jump on a building, and it killed me.
[93:26.14]Now I'm being told, well, Jerva, you actually went off.
[93:30.34]You have to go from a little bit lower.
[93:31.88]I'm like, okay.
[93:46.92]Dude, this is a kid's game.
[93:47.94]Relax.
[93:48.38]This game is not for kids.
[93:58.01]I'm not sure what we... Okay, those Elsa Spider-Man videos and Elden Ring... I don't know what could be worse for a child's brain.
[94:06.39]You know what I mean?
[94:07.83]This is not a kid's game.
[94:08.83]Don't let a kid play this.
[94:20.17]My little sister plays this game.
[94:23.31]Don't let a child play this!
[94:39.94]Okay.
[94:49.06]What time is it?
[94:49.90]It's moving, okay.
[94:55.04]Simple.
[94:55.58]It's so simple.
[94:56.56]It's easy.
[94:57.46]Right there.
[94:58.10]Fall down to a level where I can jump on it.
[95:00.52]And just jump onto it.
[95:01.76]It's gonna be worth it.
[95:03.14]I'm gonna become a cold sorcerer.
[95:09.78]Simple.
[95:10.50]It's so easy.
[95:11.36]Here we are.
[95:11.88]We're right here.
[95:13.60]It's so easy.
[95:16.43]My sister's 24.
[95:19.60]Well then, alright.
[95:20.62]But, yeah.
[95:21.96]Don't, don't do, okay.
[95:24.82]Get off the horse.
[95:25.94]The horse is making, overcomplicates this.
[95:42.09]How low do I need to be?
[95:49.80]This is where I jumped from before.
[95:50.91]So, alright.
[95:52.33]If I go from... Oh my god!
[95:54.25]Okay.
[95:55.67]If I go from here... There's nothing else I can jump from.
[95:58.95]This is the only one I can jump from.
[96:01.17]There's no other one to jump from.
[96:12.54]Now we just have to wait an hour.
[96:20.30]Shit.
[96:22.30]It's not over there, right?
[96:37.53]It's not over there.
[96:38.79]It's definitely here.
[96:39.39]You need to fight Mohg.
[96:46.56]When I eventually get to Mohg...
[96:48.93]I'm gonna snap his neck.
[96:49.95]I'm gonna sneak up behind Mohg and just grab him.
[96:55.96]Just... Just turn!
[96:58.48]Turn!
[97:08.25]Unka W. It's Mohg!
[97:09.91]It's a Mo- What do you mean?
[97:13.70]Oh no, but sneaking up behind Mohg with a fucking sword this long and shoving it through his back.
[97:19.77]Oh, Pog!
[97:20.67]But I say I'm gonna snap Mohg's neck.
[97:23.13]Ugh.
[97:25.51]Oh, Jerma.
[97:27.63]Oh my god.
[97:28.69]Relax.
[97:29.25]Oh my goodness.
[97:38.35]Now?
[97:38.77]Nope.
[97:50.44]Somebody said if you do- I bet a three day ban you don't make it.
[97:54.16]If I make this ban that person for three days.
[98:10.19]Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.
[98:15.78]I gotta get up there.
[98:17.28]You're about to be banned for three days.
[98:19.66]Turning around?
[98:37.15]Fucking god damn it.
[98:40.13]I actually can't believe it.
[98:42.71]He was turning around.
[98:43.91]Was he not turning?
[98:45.15]I thought he was turning around.
[98:46.07]What am I doing this for?
[98:50.36]Because there's an item in there that I really, really need.
[98:53.48]Fuck.
[98:59.70]Was he turning around though?
[99:00.72]It looked like he was turning and walking the other way.
[99:05.68]Is it actually the jump from the horse?
[99:08.77]Go get a different one.
[99:13.45]I'm begging you, there's a different one.
[99:20.88]Where's the other one?
[99:25.98]There are like eight.
[99:27.26]Is this island south of Limgrave?
[99:31.93]One down here.
[99:32.81]But wouldn't... Isn't this one... Do you have to do the certain ones?
[99:40.44]I thought it, like, didn't... It's not tied to the area?
[99:45.42]No.
[99:47.88]How come I couldn't get... Rinalis from the one I just went to?
[99:51.18]It wasn't available.
[99:56.22]Behind the... Next to the shack on the left side.
[100:02.00]okay some are minor the ones with bells are the ones you need oh oh oh oh
[100:25.16]So, is this one weird, or is this one just clean as feet?
[100:30.28]This one's definitely just clean as feet.
[100:31.52]Okay, sure.
[100:31.88]Let's go.
[100:58.48]Why would this make walking harder?
[101:00.02]Wouldn't this make walking easier?
[101:14.01]Alright, finally!
[101:36.60]So.
[101:38.51]Fucking sick.
[101:39.71]Let's go.
[101:41.39]Alright, we want Rennala's.
[101:51.58]Oh, that's so annoying.
[101:52.90]Alright, I want Rennala's Remembrance.
[101:57.57]I want the staff from, you know...
[102:01.02]Because I want to do cold.
[102:02.48]Now, please confirm this.
[102:04.70]The full moon sorceries are cold sorceries.
[102:07.98]Please.
[102:08.44]I'm asking you.
[102:09.80]This is cold.
[102:11.16]Full moon sorcery is cold sorcery.
[102:18.76]What's the point of me doing this?
[102:24.66]It's just the moon ones.
[102:25.88]But my sword counts.
[102:32.60]I think so.
[102:45.41]I hope so.
[102:47.23]It buffs all magic.
[102:50.00]It boosts moon sorcery.
[102:54.69]It doesn't boost your sword.
[102:57.01]No, no, no.
[102:57.51]I'm talking about... Hold on.
[102:58.69]I don't want to just waste this if this is wrong.
[103:01.01]I need some lore masters to tell me.
[103:04.43]This moon blade is a moon sorcery.
[103:10.92]Right?
[103:14.86]It won't boost the moon blade.
[103:18.12]Moon sorcery is different.
[103:19.60]No.
[103:20.14]Well, why am I doing this?
[103:25.81]It won't boost the sword, only moon spells.
[103:29.95]It does not boost the moonblade.
[103:31.61]Why am I doing this?
[103:38.51]Moonblade counts as a carrion sword.
[103:40.55]Did one guy put like an hour on this stream of us going and doing this?
[103:54.71]Because the whole point was to get that new staff.
[104:01.97]It's a good staff regardless.
[104:06.14]Carrion-Glintstone staff is the one that boosts this spell.
[104:10.30]Oh.
[104:13.44]Do I have that?
[104:21.58]Even a sorcerer that might enact the role of knight enhances carrion sword sorceries.
[104:29.28]This is, that's a carrion, but it's an OP stuff.
[104:34.90]You're already here, might as well just do it.
[104:37.82]I know.
[104:40.83]I got it.
[104:46.89]Somebody told me to do this.
[104:49.09]It's the best staff and upgrades the moon spell, which is the best spell in the game.
[105:00.04]It's a snow witch sorcery.
[105:08.46]Well, then I'm gonna have to get some more moon shit.
[105:20.28]What do I need?
[105:20.78]I need 60 int to put this on.
[105:25.38]Moon does not matter.
[105:26.79]Only two moon spells.
[105:29.73]It's the best.
[105:30.19]Is this the best?
[105:33.93]Whatever.
[105:35.07]I'm buying it.
[105:36.29]I'm going to take it.
[105:36.93]Because I'm going to use it eventually here.
[105:46.05]Boost full moon sorceries.
[105:49.10]It starts... This is also S-scaling.
[105:53.78]Okay.
[105:55.69]That was a great, like, 45 wasted minutes.
[106:01.63]Let's continue the playthrough.
[106:03.45]Don't you think so?
[106:06.29]Go duplicate it again to get the moon.
[106:18.82]This was a filler episode.
[106:20.44]No, it's not.
[106:20.98]We're about to do real fucking content.
[106:22.40]You better get ready.
[106:26.96]The moon is too slow.
[106:27.96]Alright.
[106:29.61]Enough.
[106:31.21]I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get my fucking runes.
[106:45.83]And we're going to continue to play the game.
[106:48.17]And that was, you know, great content.
[106:51.85]It was about 30 to 40 minutes of just wasted time.
[106:57.19]Alright.
[107:07.68]Ruins are long gone.
[107:08.64]What do you mean?
[107:15.29]Wait, are they?
[107:16.45]Your runes are gone.
[107:17.57]Wait, didn't I have 40,000 runes?
[107:18.85]I died.
[107:21.11]I died like 10 times.
[107:30.02]Oh, yeah.
[107:46.86]Don't worry, you don't get out of bed for less than 50k hypers.
[107:52.96]So what's at this lake?
[107:54.16]Probably a monster.
[107:57.46]Let's explore the lake.
[107:58.78]Oh, I like the ice.
[108:00.16]Something's gonna come through the ice.
[108:04.06]I love this ice.
[108:05.12]Look at it, it's breaking.
[108:05.92]Yeah, I can see the game.
[108:07.47]I can see the video game engine.
[108:08.99]I can see it.
[108:09.67]It's pieced together.
[108:10.75]Something's breaking out of this ice.
[108:13.87]It's gonna be an ice dragon.
[108:17.11]I'm gonna come through the ground and it's gonna be insane.
[108:19.06]I'm just gonna make sure I get a good view.
[108:26.47]Something here.
[108:30.91]Where is it?
[108:32.36]Just heard it.
[108:52.94]What the fuck?
[108:53.56]That was quick.
[108:54.06]Knocked 1.
[109:17.30]God, I'm awful!
[109:27.30]Oh my god, I'm not good!
[109:40.19]Ash of War.
[109:41.41]Sepuku.
[109:45.77]Sepuku.
[109:53.98]Useful on swords.
[109:54.86]Uh... Well, that's probably amazing.
[109:57.58]That sounds incredible.
[109:58.36]Get that on a fast weapon.
[110:20.55]It's OP.
[110:21.57]Yeah.
[110:21.97]It's really OP.
[110:22.97]I imagine.
[110:23.87]Alright.
[110:25.35]Where's the ice dragon?
[110:27.07]I want a good view.
[110:27.85]Alright.
[110:31.74]Here.
[110:31.92]Here it comes.
[110:36.52]Come on.
[110:36.82]Give me a good view.
[110:42.05]Yeah.
[110:42.41]Here it comes.
[110:42.73]Here it comes.
[110:54.00]Where is it?
[110:56.68]I didn't get a good view.
[110:58.96]It's an ice dragon, isn't it?
[111:00.74]It is an ice dragon.
[111:01.78]I told you.
[111:02.40]I was certain we were getting an ice dragon right here.
[111:22.59]motherfucker definitely drops ice saucers you know it force force
[111:51.35]I thought... Okay, this is why I didn't move.
[111:56.14]Why I thought I didn't... I thought it was going up to do the thing where it hovers and then lands.
[112:01.76]So I was going to dodge it and then get on the horse.
[112:11.41]Oh, you know what?
[112:11.97]That's not a bad idea.
[112:12.77]I can cast this on the horse.
[112:15.25]Holy shit.
[112:15.81]What?
[112:16.19]Are you serious?
[112:17.27]What?
[112:20.15]I can actually do that?
[112:21.11]I'm in a fucking weird mood, I'm sorry.
[112:29.07]Can you please do the me strong scream after you beat the game?
[112:32.19]Everybody wants the me strong scream, but I don't know if I want.
[112:35.01]It's like I don't want to like... Why did I do that back there?
[112:55.36]Holy shit, actually kinda good.
[113:02.90]It's actually awful here.
[113:05.41]Yeah, it's awful.
[113:17.62]He moves around.
[113:41.22]stamina, please.
[113:42.40]Where you going?
[113:47.55]What are you doing?
[113:55.56]That was weird.
[114:25.60]shit what the fuck
[115:26.83]Wow, my eye!
[115:28.10]It hit me in the eye!
[115:29.12]That felt like it hit me in the eye in real life!
[115:31.90]I feel like my eye hurts!
[115:33.84]It hit me in the eye!
[115:34.58]It hit me in the eye, I can't see!
[115:39.35]It like scratched my eye!
[115:44.92]That scratched my eye!
[115:46.18]That was crazy!
[115:47.86]What?
[115:48.18]There's no power?
[115:49.24]I feel like it hit me in the face.
[115:57.42]Okay, um... Was that 3D for anybody else here?
[116:06.07]That really felt like 3D, like it came out of the screen and like...
[116:11.85]Okay, um... So, there's no... That's unfortunate.
[116:16.32]I thought I was gonna get, like, an ice power.
[116:19.16]Well, that's cool, though.
[116:19.98]There goes that dragon.
[116:21.76]That means we have completed that area.
[116:24.18]Mark it.
[116:24.46]I didn't have any.
[116:35.18]Okay.
[116:35.94]But wait, hold on.
[116:36.58]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[116:37.40]That's not it.
[116:38.60]Let's take a look around the edges.
[116:43.82]Oh, it's a faith.
[116:44.62]Right, right, right, right.
[116:52.56]You have 100,000 runes?
[116:54.10]I'm not going to lose 100,000 runes right now.
[116:55.64]I already lost 50k.
[116:59.37]I'm just checking in the area.
[117:00.33]There's nothing else here.
[117:03.59]Exactly.
[117:04.15]That's why I came here.
[117:05.91]I'm going to take a look.
[117:06.75]I like this area.
[117:07.83]This area makes my teeth hurt.
[117:09.11]It's kind of cool.
[117:23.07]So that's just a big dragon.
[117:29.51]So, uh, this is a good place to wrap around.
[117:32.07]Wait a minute.
[117:32.61]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[117:33.69]Yeah, the edge of the, uh, lake.
[117:34.97]There's a thing over there.
[117:35.75]I think it's probably like a church.
[117:41.66]This game is physically hurting you.
[117:42.92]Hold air.
[117:50.22]Yeah, like...
[118:00.63]It makes you turn purple, too.
[118:12.05]Synesthesia?
[118:14.07]What?
[118:15.51]What is that?
[118:20.06]It is a church.
[118:20.58]Alright.
[118:20.84]I'm pretty desperate for a better heal.
[118:23.92]Put this one in here.
[118:31.69]You need to replace your dentures.
[118:38.99]Somber Stone Miner's Bell Bearing.
[118:44.74]Oh, thank God.
[118:46.10]Yes.
[118:46.56]Nice, nice, nice.
[118:47.28]Very nice.
[118:53.81]250 vitality.
[118:54.33]I think I have like 42.
[118:57.23]There we are.
[118:57.99]A Sacred Tear.
[119:05.47]What do you have to say?
[119:09.34]Spoken echoes linger here.
[119:12.24]Words of Queen Marika.
[119:15.06]Who vanished long ago.
[119:16.52]You.
[119:17.18]If you wish.
[119:19.28]I will share them with you.
[119:22.20]I'm interested.
[119:22.84]It's you.
[119:23.42]And this is Marika.
[119:24.36]In Marika's own words.
[119:26.78]Hark, brave warriors.
[119:29.78]Hark, my Lord Godfrey.
[119:32.15]We commend your deeds.
[119:34.41]Guidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal to the place ye stand.
[119:40.25]Put the giants to the sword and confine the flame atop the mount.
[119:45.58]Let a new epoch begin.
[119:48.14]An epoch glistening with life.
[119:51.32]Brandish the Elden Ring for the age of the Erdtree.
[120:02.27]I'm using the bathroom right now.
[120:06.11]I dig a hole and I go.
[120:07.61]This is kind of a weird time for you to be here.
[120:10.96]I appreciate the help though.
[120:19.18]Plastic fucking joke.
[120:28.38]Ow.
[120:31.72]Ow.
[120:32.34]Mm-mm.
[120:33.66]Mm-mm.
[120:34.24]Mm-mm.
[120:36.90]My mouth.
[120:38.74]What the fuck?
[120:39.98]Somebody... This game's hurting me.
[120:45.72]I just, like, bit a piece of skin off.
[120:47.98]This game hurts me.
[120:54.43]I like bit my skin on my lip.
[120:56.97]It was like, ow.
[120:57.57]Oh, that's... Wait, do you have any more to say?
[121:07.58]No.
[121:08.26]Oh, that's cool.
[121:09.78]Pretty cool, dude.
[121:18.80]Uh, I definitely need to... How many... How much INT do I have?
[121:23.10]I need 60 to put that staff on.
[121:24.86]So, let's see.
[121:25.91]I have the talisman.
[121:28.71]58!
[121:28.91]I need two more INT and I can put the staff on.
[121:32.67]I think I might be able to get close.
[121:34.55]Let's find out.
[121:35.25]I think it's because you have a UTI.
[121:46.53]Thanks, Doc.
[121:57.06]Take a tear.
[121:57.63]Oh, sorry.
[121:58.15]My ear was itchy.
[122:06.61]I could do that, too.
[122:08.21]I had five?
[122:08.98]I thought I only had four.
[122:10.80]Oh, shit.
[122:11.52]Alright.
[122:13.20]We'll do ten in... We'll do ten in spree.
[122:20.94]Very cool.
[122:22.16]So.
[122:25.06]I did this.
[122:26.36]Let's mark it.
[122:28.02]As completed.
[122:28.60]The sword means it has been complete.
[122:30.80]There is this Erdtree.
[122:31.98]We're going to do the Erdtree.
[122:34.90]I'm going to just head this way.
[122:38.54]What was over here?
[122:41.16]I'm not going to teleport because there might be something on the way.
[122:45.60]There's also this Volcano Manor thing.
[122:47.50]Which I thought I couldn't do.
[122:52.17]Okay.
[122:53.01]That sounds like a plan to me.
[122:54.05]Let's keep going.
[122:58.25]What about the fort?
[123:02.21]Isn't that this here?
[123:05.45]Fort to the north.
[123:08.83]Do you not see a marker on it?
[123:13.21]There's a marker on it.
[123:21.80]Fight Mohg.
[123:24.88]I will fight Mohg when I feel like it.
[123:27.07]And now I'm gonna wait till the final stream.
[123:30.87]I'm gonna summon him.
[123:33.57]I'm gonna- I'm gonna use his item.
[123:36.91]Like, on the edge of a cliff.
[123:38.59]I'm gonna summon him in front of me and he's gonna fall like Wile E. Coyote style and die.
[123:50.27]Back over here.
[123:50.79]Alright, that can go that way.
[123:51.69]What's this?
[123:53.05]Ooh!
[123:54.09]There's a spring jump.
[123:55.85]And there's a casket.
[123:58.81]Uncovering.
[124:13.50]Come get me, dogs!
[124:33.84]That's actually kind of good against dogs, even though I used like three potions.
[124:41.44]Oh, yeah.
[124:42.12]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[124:43.22]I can definitely level up now.
[124:46.34]And then I'm going to have to commit to putting a bunch of stones into that thing.
[124:52.00]I hope that's actually a good staff and it wasn't a huge mistake.
[124:54.38]Okay.
[125:04.40]Best move in the game.
[125:05.56]I don't think it's the best move in the game.
[125:06.74]You know what's really crazy about this?
[125:10.46]Like, these caskets.
[125:12.54]They're kind of everywhere.
[125:14.00]People are, like, coming out of these caskets.
[125:17.08]And coming back to life.
[125:20.08]Weird.
[125:20.63]Are these, like, tarnished?
[125:24.69]It's interesting.
[125:25.51]There's been at least, like, two of these in every single zone.
[125:33.20]And they always have the little runes on them.
[125:34.74]Like, that's the last little bits of their, like, souls or something.
[125:41.84]They all... Yeah, they, like, wake up and, like, get up and start walking around.
[125:47.07]Really weird.
[125:47.73]But let's do this.
[125:48.55]Just that.
[125:52.43]Is there anything else down there that I didn't... It might be a dungeon down here, though.
[125:57.51]Hold on.
[126:07.66]There's probably a dungeon here.
[126:13.92]Just look.
[126:14.26]Is it going to kill me?
[126:15.48]It's going to.
[126:15.92]It's going to kill me, isn't it?
[126:22.75]Let's see if there's a dungeon right here.
[126:24.13]I feel like there would be.
[126:25.31]I guess not.
[126:31.98]Stop using the baby toy weapon.
[126:33.48]It's really good.
[126:35.38]It's been great so far.
[126:38.00]Why would I stop using it?
[126:39.26]It's been actually fantastic.
[126:40.92]It's been a great weapon.
[126:41.84]It's helped... It's been amazing.
[126:42.98]It's been... It's actually been a really good weapon.
[126:44.22]It's a great weapon.
[126:46.88]Why would I check it off?
[126:51.34]It's low to mid.
[126:53.38]Whatever.
[126:54.14]It's a great weapon.
[126:55.09]It's a good weapon.
[127:00.15]I like it.
[127:01.83]Guardians, Garrison...
[127:14.68]Oh my god, there's another fucking dog!
[127:25.77]Okay.
[127:27.01]Okay.
[127:27.75]Okay.
[127:28.35]We've got him.
[127:29.21]Okay.
[127:54.66]What the fuck?!
[128:08.68]I can't fucking do it!
[128:10.60]What's happening?!
[128:12.93]Somebody get in there and die!
[128:23.78]This is the most chaotic, sloppy piece of shit I've ever seen.
[128:27.80]This was, look at how sloppy this is.
[128:31.12]What a sloppy piece of shit that was.
[128:36.86]That item, I feel like I'm like, oh wow, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, there are 5 enemies there.
[128:41.53]Let me like, cast the cloud of raining crystals.
[128:44.79]And I just aggro like 8 people.
[128:57.08]Okay, this is why I don't like using the sorceries that often.
[129:01.22]Because you just, like, stand still and, like, move one mile per hour to go like this.
[129:06.13]Because you really so badly want the move to look cool and to work.
[129:09.65]And then you just end up aggroing, like, fucking 30 people.
[129:12.51]And then I... Oh, I want to, like... Oh, it's going to kill, like, those four people.
[129:15.55]I could have hit those guys three times and they would die.
[129:19.14]One, two, three.
[129:20.06]Like, why do I need to go, like...
[129:26.08]Oh, dude, it did like 150 damage.
[129:26.81]Just kill him.
[129:27.15]Kill him.
[129:27.49]Like this.
[129:27.71]Ready?
[129:27.83]Watch this.
[129:54.69]I had a FUCKING STAMINA!
[130:06.56]Sucks too.
[130:08.86]See?
[130:09.16]It happened to you too.
[130:10.42]You could've just swung the fucking sword at me twice and killed me.
[130:13.52]Instead you had to show your chat like the cool move you have.
[130:17.68]And then it got you killed.
[130:25.20]When are you going to play the real Dark Souls?
[130:35.32]Like Dark Souls 1?
[130:36.16]He doesn't know how to dodge.
[130:43.81]Bro.
[130:45.29]I beat nobody in the game first try so far.
[130:49.31]So never mind.
[130:51.18]Time that person up for 5 minutes though.
[131:11.82]Alright, so what do we got here?
[131:31.58]I said do something funny.
[131:32.98]I feel like the last five minutes straight have been funny of me trying to like I feel like that was funny Is that not funny?
[131:42.29]I feel like it could have been funny I feel like that was funny
[131:52.92]I feel like the last, like, hour has been kind of funny.
[131:56.14]Because I went on a wild goose chase for an hour.
[131:59.62]To a thing I didn't even need to do.
[132:01.06]And, like, a few people in chat were telling me that I could have gone another way.
[132:04.86]And I didn't listen to them.
[132:06.48]And I just literally jumped off a cliff 13 to 14 times in a row.
[132:10.16]It was kind of funny.
[132:11.86]It was kind of funny.
[132:15.50]Oh, you want me to do something funny?
[132:17.60]Like, you want me to, like, tell a joke?
[132:19.24]Okay, I get it.
[132:20.48]Um, sure.
[132:26.82]Why did the, um... Flame Guard?
[132:30.42]Why does this person have a name?
[132:35.16]What the fuck was that?
[132:37.14]Uh... Why did the chicken cross the road?
[132:39.22]Okay.
[132:49.30]To get modded and ban that guy for a day.
[133:08.41]Alright, I need to go up.
[133:17.37]He's power hungry.
[133:18.93]Yes, I am.
[133:21.37]These late night streams, I swear to God, I'm fucking wrong with me.
[133:25.13]I promise.
[133:25.43]If you're like a new viewer, I promise I'm not this weird all the time.
[133:28.07]Sometimes, but not all the fucking time.
[133:29.73]Not the whole time.
[133:35.51]I think I have to go on the edge, maybe?
[133:38.28]Like up that way?
[133:42.08]Is there a ladder here?
[133:42.70]Shit, I didn't even see the ladder.
[133:55.21]People keep calling you a psycho.
[133:56.35]What's your response?
[133:58.67]I don't know.
[133:59.93]How do I respond to that?
[134:02.25]Or should I say, I just, you know, it's me just hanging out and fucking around?
[134:08.07]And I think, uh, I would say, I would, I don't think that's accurate.
[134:11.74]I would say eccentric.
[134:21.02]That way, let's check.
[134:27.77]Ooh, nice.
[134:29.85]Anybody that calls themselves eccentric is usually... Is there anywhere else I can do over there?
[134:46.25]Cool.
[134:49.83]I gotta get up.
[134:55.53]Alright, go that way.
[135:00.40]I'm not... No, I'm kidding.
[135:01.78]I'm not like calling.
[135:05.38]I'm just fucking around.
[135:17.16]Well, a good thing I... I did not know you were in here and you're way scarier, dog.
[135:26.62]Jesus.
[135:27.10]Chief Guardian...
[135:29.77]What the fuck?
[135:38.16]What was that?
[135:38.82]Alright.
[135:48.58]That was kind of annoying.
[135:49.62]That was like one, two, three.
[135:55.99]That was quick.
[136:15.62]Go, go, go, go, go.
[136:19.88]Dogs can't climb ladders, right?
[136:21.16]That'd be actually kind of funny if they could.
[136:27.64]It's like somebody mastered the art of becoming a human.
[136:38.25]Is that, you're talking about me?
[136:43.39]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[136:51.57]Dude, how many fucking times am I gonna do that one in a row?
[137:03.57]These guys give a lot of, uh, souls.
[137:05.85]Okay, keep going.
[137:18.65]I'm usually the Joker.
[137:19.77]Yeah.
[137:24.67]Alright.
[137:26.11]Where does this guy even come from?
[137:28.01]Oh, he's here the whole... Alright, I gotta... Alright, go, go, go, go, go.
[137:30.79]Priorities.
[137:31.51]Priorities.
[137:36.18]Shit, bad.
[137:37.28]Very bad, very bad.
[137:38.02]Get the souls and just die.
[137:44.22]I'm alive, I'm alive.
[137:44.84]Get me out of this room before he kills me with this stupid fire thing!
[137:50.75]God The fuck out of here Oh my god, this guy's got all it's gonna be hard I
[138:18.00]That shield has tons of magic damage.
[138:26.51]Jesus, that's awesome.
[138:27.73]Can I have that?
[138:33.57]It's free.
[138:34.11]Just spam it.
[139:01.28]Oh!
[139:01.76]I'm alive.
[139:06.93]One-eyed shield.
[139:09.11]That guy was worth a lot of souls.
[139:13.87]That was fun.
[139:14.49]Okay, so what is that?
[139:15.59]36 strength.
[139:20.77]Great shield.
[139:23.17]Tricksome shield made from white stone depicting a malformed one-eyed god.
[139:27.57]Barrel of a firearm pokes through the open mouth.
[139:34.03]Once worshipped by the giants, this evil deity is believed to have been slain by Queen Marika.
[139:40.87]Evil deity.
[139:42.77]So you get the cannon.
[139:49.70]This doesn't require anything besides strength.
[139:52.95]So that's actually really cool.
[139:55.73]I wonder how much damage it does when you upgrade it.
[139:58.33]This one's cool too.
[139:59.17]This doesn't require faith.
[140:00.75]This is the big fire one.
[140:05.64]This one needs way more strength though.
[140:08.56]The gun shield?
[140:09.26]That's cool.
[140:11.88]Very cool.
[140:12.62]Alright, so... Continue.
[140:17.75]I think that was a pretty good sorcery fight.
[140:21.14]It does about 2100 damage to adds.
[140:23.18]Wow, that's actually pretty good.
[140:26.58]2000 damage.
[140:28.12]I hear a cookie bug.
[140:40.33]You hear it?
[140:40.73]I heard it.
[140:48.15]I swear to God, I heard it.
[140:57.13]It's not the rattle.
[140:58.55]Maybe it's up.
[140:58.97]Okay, it's probably up.
[141:10.15]Yeah, I love these Elden Ring streams.
[141:13.29]I'm having a great time.
[141:14.03]I feel like something's gonna get up.
[141:29.53]Giant's Prayer Book.
[141:34.67]What does that teach you?
[141:43.11]Giant's Flame, take thee.
[141:44.83]Flame, fall upon them.
[141:48.69]I have a feeling that's Faith.
[141:50.75]But that's cool, though.
[141:54.23]Are there any mimic chests in Elden Ring?
[141:56.67]Surprisingly, no.
[141:59.54]I guess they didn't wait can I jump from here I guess there was uh maybe lore wise there's no reason to have them but there's like trap chests not really yeah I don't know I haven't really found one I think I would have seen one by now alright well that's cool
[142:32.85]Unless there's something else I can do over here, which there probably is.
[142:34.85]Can I do anything else this way?
[142:38.39]I don't think so.
[142:43.66]After you beat it, do you think you'll still stream it?
[142:45.22]Once in a while.
[142:45.74]These streams are really fun.
[142:48.02]Okay, there's an item here.
[142:49.36]The plan is to... So, after I beat it, whenever that is, I want to do a couple of, like, kind of co-op, like, PvP sort of community nights.
[143:02.98]Where... Maybe I'll do the me strong stream.
[143:06.94]It's possible.
[143:08.60]But I want to do where I just have a password and we just do PvP.
[143:12.56]I also want to do just like invasion streams.
[143:14.88]Where I just kind of invade or turn on invasions and just kind of fuck around.
[143:20.25]I think I pretty much cleared it.
[143:21.37]Maybe there's something else I didn't see, but it's all good.
[143:24.59]This is like a back entrance.
[143:25.55]Alright, the next marking is up here.
[143:35.48]You have a group password.
[143:37.26]I don't have online turned on right now, but I will.
[143:44.10]Let me get out of here.
[143:51.20]So that is that.
[143:55.60]Decide on a password right now.
[144:02.38]I don't have a password.
[144:03.20]I'm not going to give you a password.
[144:05.83]I did that.
[144:06.25]That was cool.
[144:07.25]I got the prayer book and a couple of little things.
[144:09.97]Now we're going this way.
[144:11.77]I want to do... There's a marker that I have over here.
[144:17.19]Okay.
[144:19.43]Is this the Volcano Manor thing?
[144:21.77]This here?
[144:22.59]The Erdtree, which is here.
[144:23.83]Let me put a marker on this because it is done.
[144:31.59]This is also done.
[144:34.58]I'm going to put a marker there just because there was an item behind that.
[144:39.98]Alright.
[144:40.79]I also need to go down here at some point.
[144:43.25]So we'll do that after.
[144:44.91]I'm still looking up here.
[144:48.35]Go to this point here.
[144:57.95]Go to the northern fort.
[144:58.79]I will.
[145:00.03]I'm just kind of making my way around.
[145:02.13]Alright.
[145:02.43]We need to go to one.
[145:06.07]One is the Erdtree like that over here.
[145:11.23]Maybe I can't get up here from here.
[145:17.80]You look great for somebody with Lego hair.
[145:19.50]Thanks.
[145:22.62]I hope it stays for another few years at least.
[145:26.44]I got no gray hairs really either, which is really surprising.
[145:32.41]I'm happy with the hair right now.
[145:35.69]If it takes me into like 40, that'd be great.
[145:38.99]I've already been this way.
[145:40.17]It's probably better to go from here.
[145:43.96]Unless... Let's go do this.
[145:52.12]Who asked?
[145:52.82]Somebody did.
[145:59.75]Are you on any hair medication?
[146:01.05]No?
[146:01.11]No?
[146:05.15]I don't take any medication for it or anything.
[146:07.93]Just there.
[146:08.32]I am going to assure you, though, that it's not gonna... It's gonna go.
[146:15.24]When it goes, it's gonna go.
[146:24.27]Ah, there it is.
[146:24.77]Alright.
[146:29.69]But it's alright.
[146:30.45]Whatever.
[146:31.05]Okay, I did not think remotely that I was going to have hair for this long.
[146:37.97]I really didn't.
[146:38.77]Should I cut the lock?
[146:40.19]Traveling maidenhood?
[146:41.43]Like a maiden outfit?
[146:49.53]foot worn by traveling maidens.
[146:51.73]Maidens traverse the Lands Between for different reasons.
[146:55.02]Some just seek audience with the fingers, others to find the tarnished who they were destined to guide.
[146:59.76]Stop!
[147:00.28]What's happening over here?
[147:05.00]Finger Maiden, traveling maiden.
[147:13.96]What's the difference?
[147:19.09]Traveling Maiden?
[147:19.95]Okay.
[147:28.43]Is there a... I do not see... I'm kind of afraid of this.
[147:42.89]Is there not a Grace over here?
[147:44.64]Okay, well, I... There's no Grace here, I don't think.
[147:51.45]Wait, is there one over here?
[147:55.77]Day one of Jerma not reading my messages.
[147:57.93]Start the counter over again.
[148:03.52]Nothing here.
[148:05.02]Wait, what's that?
[148:05.78]Okay, there might be something right there.
[148:08.72]I don't want to do this until I have too many souls to lose.
[148:10.64]Let me see if there's one right here.
[148:25.57]What the fuck are you doing here?
[148:31.87]Alright, let's check and see if there's one here.
[148:37.05]Alright, is there a Grace?
[148:49.76]All the way up?
[148:59.50]Did I go in those?
[149:00.42]Oh, shit.
[149:03.46]I'm going in here.
[149:05.56]Stargazer's Ruins.
[149:08.86]Alright, well, there's definitely a dungeon here.
[149:12.28]Maybe not, but, you know.
[149:14.29]I did have this marked, anyways.
[149:15.33]I had it marked.
[149:32.17]Is that you?
[149:32.87]Forever and ever it seems
[150:01.17]Held shut by a seal.
[150:02.33]It is this.
[150:11.82]It's this.
[150:12.38]It is this.
[150:12.86]Can I talk?
[150:14.10]Summon a jellyfish here.
[150:31.19]What does that do with it?
[150:41.77]Does it work?
[150:48.23]These things are like... Did I lose that?
[150:56.03]A seal was broken?
[150:56.73]Did I lose that summon?
[151:03.09]Still here.
[151:08.85]Let's just get this shit out of me.
[151:11.02]Where is it?
[151:11.52]Oh, that's gravel for mercy.
[151:21.96]Curtsy?
[151:22.36]No, it's like spin.
[151:23.47]Where is it?
[151:24.35]Okay, I see it.
[151:33.32]Okay.
[151:35.00]So now what's down here?
[151:39.22]Oh, fucking starlight!
[151:42.81]I'm annoying, I think.
[151:50.54]Primal glintstone blade.
[152:02.12]Spells consume less FP, but maximum HP is reduced by a lot.
[152:08.02]Oh my god.
[152:08.94]This is almost... It's 300.
[152:16.83]It's not... It's worth it?
[152:20.83]It's a lot of HP to lose.
[152:23.15]It's too much HP to lose.
[152:35.49]That's a lot of HP.
[152:36.97]Try it.
[152:40.29]Okay.
[152:46.25]So what does it do with it all?
[152:56.40]Is it like 30% or so?
[153:05.62]I mean, it seems significant.
[153:10.86]Keep in mind, the staff that I have on is, uh, makes me, uh, everything cost more.
[153:22.85]It's definitely doing a little bit.
[153:24.71]That's two, three, four, five, six.
[153:33.62]Okay, so what about with it off?
[153:35.18]Is it maybe one extra spell?
[153:40.58]One.
[153:43.34]Four.
[153:46.61]It's two extra spells.
[153:48.95]I can cast two more times.
[153:50.19]That's actually kind of good.
[153:54.31]That health reduction, though, is really, really bad.
[153:57.47]Where's my health right now?
[153:59.94]It's right at the edge of the compass.
[154:06.67]Oh, yikes.
[154:07.29]That's bad.
[154:08.39]I'll try it for a little while, but I can't promise I'm going to keep this on.
[154:12.81]Cool, though.
[154:14.21]Especially when I start using the other staff.
[154:18.02]Once the other staff goes on, it's reduced by even more.
[154:21.30]Because this staff makes me cast faster, but everything costs more.
[154:28.04]Very cool.
[154:29.84]Well, that's that.
[154:32.09]Probably worth it.
[154:34.73]We'll see.
[154:36.14]I'm open to trying it.
[154:39.22]It did replace the FP from killing enemies though.
[154:42.19]Which hasn't really been that much of a factor.
[154:44.99]I will be honest.
[154:46.65]Over the last stream or two.
[154:49.39]I need to level up because I have enough to put the new staff on.
[154:59.40]And we're going to commit to it.
[155:05.35]That was kind of... That was kind of ridiculous.
[155:07.19]Alright, cool.
[155:07.82]So now... I need to go here.
[155:12.36]Is there a Grace here somewhere, though?
[155:14.62]Come on, man.
[155:19.06]Can't wait for the Elden Ring vids.
[155:20.90]Are you gonna replace the baby rattle?
[155:22.95]At this point, I don't know if I can.
[155:25.73]I have enough, probably, somber stones or smithing stones to get something to, like, plus seven?
[155:31.53]Seven?
[155:33.22]But I still have not found the final Smithing Stone yet.
[155:37.47]At least for the Sombra variety.
[155:39.95]I don't know.
[155:53.27]I need to be down... Hey!
[156:01.70]What the fuck?
[156:03.23]Is it this?
[156:09.37]Is that?
[156:09.65]Is this a boss?
[156:14.93]Oh my god.
[156:38.74]Don't hurt him.
[156:41.58]He's shooting fucking laser beams at me.
[156:48.08]Oh, fuck.
[156:50.06]Can I not target him?
[157:16.01]Come on, go!
[157:22.02]He just runs out.
[157:23.06]No luck.
[157:44.99]Just whack him!
[157:57.04]He's- Get out of this like fucking tombstone shit.
[158:02.01]Where- Get out of there!
[158:05.53]You're stuck in like the fucking mountain thing.
[158:24.01]I didn't get any soul.
[158:25.55]Nothing.
[158:27.36]Zero.
[158:28.44]Not even runes.
[158:29.58]Nothing.
[158:32.10]Absolute zero.
[158:34.06]And no item.
[158:34.90]Unless it's hidden back here.
[158:36.12]Okay.
[158:51.97]Okay.
[158:56.35]So, uh, don't beast eye quivers.
[158:59.85]There's fucking so many of these things!
[159:04.72]What the fuck?
[159:06.54]Um, what?
[159:08.52]There's a hundred of them.
[159:16.11]There were so many of those.
[159:18.09]Give me a break.
[159:26.45]Well, I gotta go back there.
[159:27.63]Okay, so that, the plan is... Okay, so this is what happened.
[159:33.21]I, um... I, uh... Fuck, this is far away.
[159:40.82]I didn't keep going and trigger the rest of them.
[159:45.66]That would have been a lot more surprising, I think.
[159:52.03]Goddammit, I have to go all the way around.
[160:15.37]There's summons.
[160:16.11]Alright, go around.
[160:26.91]I think I missed that.
[160:32.22]Mm-hmm.
[160:42.34]All the way.
[160:42.92]I need a Grace though.
[160:48.80]Is there one seriously like right here?
[161:02.75]Well, like down here.
[161:03.39]I'm looking down here.
[161:14.59]No, no, no, I need my souls.
[161:15.96]Why is there so much random shit here?
[161:17.86]Deathrite bird?
[161:21.18]Um, I don't want to lose those souls.
[161:23.02]I have to run.
[161:26.96]Was there a Grace?
[161:30.01]Oh my god.
[161:31.89]Okay, Grace.
[161:33.77]Grace over here somewhere.
[161:38.66]not on not gonna happen you're not gonna kick me off the edge is there a Grace here it's close oh you piece of I was I'm already
[162:07.44]got to win.
[162:32.38]What is this doing down here?
[162:33.84]I'm just trying to get away from this stupid giant skeleton people and... This is this giant bird down here with magical power.
[162:44.41]At least I'm right here.
[162:52.49]Are you fucking kidding me?
[163:03.28]Oh, I thought that was a Grace.
[163:04.96]I'm killing this thing right fucking now.
[163:07.86]I'm pissed.
[163:13.57]Get off the horse.
[163:14.67]Get off.
[163:15.07]Yeah, get me off.
[163:15.57]I don't want to be on the horse right now.
[163:41.12]Thank you.
[164:12.57]That fucking move is stupid!
[164:14.00]It just like lingers... That move is stupid.
[164:20.48]It's just like... He just grazes it down and it just like... You can't hit recover from it.
[164:25.66]It just permanently just... That move is fucking stupid.
[164:34.59]Bird.
[164:39.99]The souls don't matter anymore.
[164:40.91]It's already over.
[164:43.00]Thank you.
[165:18.02]Oh my god!
[165:23.16]They don't explode, right?
[165:29.35]you with that bullshit.
[165:59.16]Okay.
[166:09.27]Maybe I have to be on the horse.
[166:12.89]Can you dodge through that?
[166:13.79]I feel like that lingers.
[166:22.14]Bring out the snake.
[166:22.70]Let's see what you got.
[166:32.45]Not bad.
[166:40.32]Does it hurt?
[166:43.30]He just got fucking staggered.
[166:45.76]Alright, well he's cool.
[166:46.90]The fire is cool though.
[166:50.26]Oh well.
[166:51.94]Maybe I do have to stay on the horse.
[166:55.07]Although I'd rather fight it off the horse.
[166:56.89]Maybe get on the horse when he does that move.
[167:00.09]I don't like fighting stuff on the horse.
[167:16.14]That's bad.
[167:18.88]I don't like fighting on the horse.
[167:23.78]It's too awkward running around on the camera.
[167:26.50]It's too hard to keep up.
[167:27.48]I was doing better with it off the horse.
[167:35.96]Let's try the boys.
[167:42.11]They're probably just gonna get scared and run away.
[167:43.81]Alright, let's go boys.
[167:49.56]Alright, I gotta jump over that.
[168:06.47]This cameraman is going to drive me fucking crazy.
[168:18.84]Whoa!
[168:19.34]He just started... What the fuck?
[168:20.70]He wasn't even looking at me.
[168:24.08]This motherfucker wasn't even looking at me.
[168:28.70]He's like, I'll attack you guys.
[168:30.32]Now you...
[168:34.16]Alright, this guy sucks.
[168:37.18]Uh, this is gonna be a lot harder than I thought.
[168:43.82]Strategies, you gotta hit him in the head.
[168:45.52]He does that explosion.
[168:46.42]I gotta see that explosion move again.
[168:47.86]Otherwise, I don't know about this.
[168:51.14]Dude, I could get right up in his ass.
[168:52.52]Like, it takes too long to get over there.
[169:01.15]Where's he?
[169:30.39]Good job, boys.
[169:31.77]Excellent work, boys.
[169:40.06]Oh my god, he's gonna explode!
[169:41.41]Eee!
[170:14.17]One of the boys literally just stunned him.
[170:17.82]Holy shit.
[170:21.04]I don't know which one of you did that.
[170:21.98]Somebody stag... Somebody like... Somebody staggered him.
[170:26.92]Did somebody actually stagger?
[170:29.36]Holy shit, that was so important.
[170:33.82]Wow.
[170:36.00]He sucked.
[170:36.62]That boss was awful.
[170:42.04]What is that thing?
[170:53.15]Where is it?
[170:56.51]Is it like a staff?
[170:57.59]Oh, here it is.
[171:02.15]Ritual spear used by priests of old who were permitted to come among the Deathbirds.
[171:07.47]Priests became guardians of the birds through the rite of death, which also serves as an oath sworn to their distant resurrection.
[171:15.15]Press the spear high, bearing prayers into the sky to summon a downpour of spectral spears.
[171:21.42]We need to see what that looks like.
[171:22.44]Okay.
[171:34.64]Damn.
[171:36.38]This does not use... Oh, it does use mana.
[171:37.96]Okay.
[171:39.82]I wonder how good that is.
[171:49.29]So that's skills.
[171:50.49]It's... D, int, D, dex.
[171:55.24]But you need a more... I need strength.
[171:56.50]It's a little too slow, though.
[171:57.60]That's cool.
[171:59.52]That's cool.
[172:01.38]Makes your hat glow.
[172:02.28]That's really cool.
[172:05.54]Okay, well now I have enough intelligence now.
[172:08.08]Now I can get my... I got my 70,000 souls back.
[172:12.29]It's time to get to 60 intelligence and it's time to get this level the fuck up.
[172:21.26]That was an intense fight.
[172:22.54]It's a little, like, shit that he put on the ground.
[172:25.86]But... The boys really pulled through there.
[172:31.01]By the way, if anyone's curious... People are like, wait, those summons are terrible.
[172:36.85]Like, that's literally the worst summon in the game.
[172:39.18]Not when they're plus 9.
[172:39.86]And soon to be plus 10.
[172:49.86]Okay.
[172:52.35]There's still that to do.
[172:53.53]But let me find a Grace.
[172:55.59]That's important.
[172:58.87]I don't know if... Seriously, I don't know if I did enough damage to do that.
[173:01.49]Or if somebody... One of them actually did that.
[173:04.67]Maybe with the fire.
[173:05.79]The torch.
[173:06.33]It was like... Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[173:08.37]Maybe.
[173:08.99]I wonder.
[173:09.27]I actually really don't know.
[173:20.49]To be honest, the summons, obviously it's like, oh yeah, the summons are cool.
[173:25.18]It's the volume, right?
[173:27.44]I know it's like, oh dude, use this one.
[173:28.76]This person's awesome.
[173:29.80]We put the serpent out there.
[173:33.09]And I got annihilated.
[173:34.21]Not plus nine, but still.
[173:36.11]Having just five things just walk around aimlessly and just bump into walls.
[173:39.87]Is there another fucking boss?
[173:42.65]Oh my god, don't die here.
[173:44.01]I need to get out of here now.
[173:44.73]I gotta get the fuck out of here right now.
[173:47.81]It's Grace right there.
[173:48.67]Okay, get out, get out, get out.
[173:49.77]Get me the fuck out of here right now.
[173:50.67]Is it safe for me to jump off this?
[173:57.60]Yep.
[174:01.04]Okay, I see it.
[174:04.56]I'm not losing those again.
[174:07.70]Not a chance.
[174:08.40]I haven't done this.
[174:09.86]Oh, this is the next thing I want to see.
[174:18.87]There is something... Okay, get off.
[174:20.87]Please get me out of here.
[174:24.25]Oh, I have like a... I just got like a wave of just spear right there.
[174:27.31]Okay.
[174:34.16]Not enough, but I think I have a crunchy.
[174:44.05]I need the souls anyways to level up the other staff, so we're going to just do it.
[174:48.41]I'm going to need actually a lot more than this.
[174:58.50]So I'm at 60 int.
[175:04.51]is now enough to use the staff.
[175:07.80]Let's get out of here for a moment.
[175:16.04]I want some more.
[175:18.94]Might take a break in a minute after this.
[175:21.40]I want to get some more water.
[175:22.80]Maybe some more tea.
[175:23.28]Let's see.
[175:26.52]Do you get a healthy amount of sleep?
[175:27.62]Yes.
[175:28.88]I do.
[175:34.08]Stop doing this.
[175:39.14]I keep just biting my lip.
[175:41.07]You know what I'm saying?
[175:42.13]Why do I keep doing that?
[175:52.37]Yes, I do.
[175:53.83]I get a good amount of sleep.
[175:54.87]I do.
[175:55.05]Get some chapstick.
[176:01.17]I have it right here.
[176:08.19]What did you vote for in 2004?
[176:09.23]What?
[176:16.35]It's like... Well?
[176:28.95]What if it was the 2004 election?
[176:38.22]How long ago was that?
[176:42.74]Was I old enough to vote?
[176:51.43]It was 18 years ago.
[176:52.49]How old am I now?
[177:03.25]I have some ball bearings to give.
[177:07.12]Smithing Miner and Sombra Miner.
[177:08.81]So I'm going to be able to buy pretty much all of them.
[177:13.77]I can buy up to Sombra 6 now.
[177:16.13]Which actually, that's a huge deal.
[177:18.29]12,000 souls.
[177:18.87]Alright.
[177:23.07]So if those of you were ever concerned about... Not there anymore.
[177:30.01]I have enough materials.
[177:35.07]You were like probably 19.
[177:37.28]I don't know.
[177:38.04]What was that?
[177:38.46]Was that like Bush?
[177:40.68]Was George Bush running for president?
[177:44.92]I don't know.
[177:46.00]That's a very long time ago.
[177:47.14]I need to look at a chart.
[177:54.37]Okay, let's go to the Smith.
[178:01.07]It was Bush and Kerry.
[178:07.10]That's when I started playing RuneScape.
[178:15.24]That's when I started playing RuneScape.
[178:19.00]In 2004.
[178:22.16]I gotta equip it because I'm not looking through all that bullshit.
[178:28.00]There it is.
[178:28.34]What do you mean I don't have enough intelligence to put it on?
[178:32.67]59?!
[178:32.69]I thought I had 60!
[178:38.57]We're doing it anyways.
[178:47.87]Okay, where is it?
[178:48.43]Where the fuck is it?
[178:54.12]Where are the staffs?
[178:55.74]Oh.
[179:02.63]Where is...
[179:04.85]I don't have a Somber Smithing Stone one?
[179:06.51]You know what?
[179:16.94]Fuck it.
[179:17.18]We're coming back.
[179:17.78]Like, I can't even use it yet anyways.
[179:19.90]Let's just keep going.
[179:21.90]I thought I had 60.
[179:22.60]That's my bad.
[179:23.98]That's my fault.
[179:25.16]I thought I had 60.
[179:27.54]Let's go.
[179:28.56]Whatever.
[179:30.55]Stop swearing.
[179:31.17]I promise I will not say a swear word for the next 15 straight minutes.
[179:48.44]Castle Sol.
[179:54.75]That thing, that must hurt.
[179:58.21]That one getting up?
[180:00.99]Is that one getting up?
[180:08.63]Shit, that hurt.
[180:13.76]I've got to frost with breath.
[180:44.95]Where is it?
[180:45.35]Where is it?
[180:46.29]Where is it?
[180:46.67]Where is he?
[180:48.15]Oh my god, he was up the whole time?
[180:49.45]How did I not get hit by one thing?
[180:51.47]What?
[180:51.71]What kind of Christmas miracle shit was that?
[181:02.82]Fuck, I gotta get mana.
[181:19.89]Wrong fucking button.
[181:26.55]There's not another one that's going to drop down, right?
[181:32.87]Holy shit.
[181:37.19]How long was he gone for?
[181:39.25]That was so, that was so scary.
[181:42.15]I look over, he's just not there.
[181:43.32]Have I, would I, was I accidentally dodging his moves?
[181:51.70]And somehow in that, I, my weapon got taken off.
[181:57.27]That was a lot of squares.
[181:58.33]Well, starting now, I did not expect that.
[182:07.74]okay uh let's go this is a pretty big place I'm gonna say I want to start left here starting now yeah that was intense
[182:36.35]I don't like how the thing's right there.
[182:37.82]It's just anxiety-inducing.
[182:43.82]I need to start doing this.
[182:44.78]Because, okay, this is where I was.
[182:48.64]I've been here.
[182:51.72]My brain needs this.
[182:52.84]I know a lot of people are going to be like, why are you doing that?
[182:55.68]Like, I did this section here.
[182:59.92]You know what I mean?
[183:00.76]So, I'm like, where was I?
[183:16.09]They're flying.
[183:23.50]I don't want to go up yet.
[183:24.36]I want to do the whole ground level first, essentially.
[183:27.84]At least most of it.
[183:33.37]Okay, again, mark it because my brain just has so much trouble.
[183:38.26]I'm going to mark that to be like I didn't go over here yet.
[184:06.01]No, no, not yet.
[184:22.75]You're a completionist.
[184:24.53]I'm not.
[184:24.94]I just want to make sure I don't... Okay, I thought that was something else.
[184:27.28]Alright, so I know what's over here.
[184:37.96]I want to shut that thing up so bad.
[184:40.00]I actually might just go out there and do it.
[184:43.80]Yeah, just come here.
[184:46.52]Is it clean?
[184:47.02]I don't see anything to clean.
[184:50.02]So, wait.
[184:50.58]There it is.
[184:54.07]Okay, just shut this thing up.
[184:55.33]You're not going to go into the building.
[185:01.77]I don't think this is supposed to be doing this.
[185:21.38]I just want to shut this thing up tonight.
[186:18.27]shirt is too tight coming off
[187:13.08]Go down!
[187:19.34]Go down already!
[187:22.03]What the fuck was that?
[187:22.79]Alright.
[187:37.12]Alright.
[187:37.52]Now the thing's not doing that anymore.
[187:39.60]That's good.
[187:40.28]Cool.
[187:41.50]Very nice.
[187:42.38]Excellent.
[187:42.77]Excellent.
[187:43.27]Excellent.
[187:43.67]Excellent.
[187:44.05]Excellent.
[187:44.45]Excellent.
[187:44.83]Excellent.
[187:47.59]I know it's in here.
[187:48.23]I'm just going to open it so I don't do it again.
[187:52.66]You killed the turtle.
[187:53.82]I did not kill the turtle.
[187:55.16]I don't know who's like fucking slandering me saying that I did that.
[187:59.73]I absolutely have.
[188:00.61]I did not kill the turtle.
[188:06.37]Hit the full moon?
[188:08.93]We'll see.
[188:16.62]Dude, dual wield the baby toy.
[188:22.74]Are the lions back?
[188:25.58]Are they dead?
[188:26.00]Yeah, they're dead.
[188:29.22]Dead, dead.
[188:29.56]Okay.
[188:31.72]Let's continue the progress.
[188:33.14]Got it marked over there.
[188:34.16]I know I gotta go that way, but we're gonna go this way first.
[188:43.55]Should I get the full moon one?
[188:45.17]I feel like that's a meme spell that no one uses, and you guys are just gonna ruin the rest of my playthrough.
[188:51.64]I'm going to get to, like, one of the hardest bosses in the game.
[188:57.27]And I could have used a different spell, but I can't.
[188:59.23]Because I did all the dumb bullshit that everybody told me to do.
[189:05.15]Or maybe I can one-hit kill one of the bosses with that.
[189:07.09]That'd be kind of cool.
[189:13.48]Alright, so we're up here.
[189:17.10]It also needs 70 intelligence.
[189:18.98]Jeez.
[189:19.22]Jeez.
[189:26.20]Freezing grease.
[189:30.63]What just flowed over here?
[189:31.47]What was that?
[189:43.73]This looks... It's ducks crossing the street.
[190:02.79]There's nothing to do with you two.
[190:04.19]I don't want to fight you.
[190:08.07]But I think I'm going to have to.
[190:13.52]I'm sorry.
[190:14.96]But there was nothing I could do.
[190:16.60]Okay.
[190:29.91]Doesn't open from this side.
[190:31.55]What's in there?
[190:32.82]There's a painting in there.
[190:34.96]Definitely want to get that.
[190:42.51]Is it almost time for a fucking green tea refill?
[190:47.71]I actually might not even have any left.
[190:51.80]It's getting late, too, though.
[190:52.72]Alright, no, no, no, I'm not done.
[190:53.98]I'm not done.
[190:55.06]I want to keep going.
[190:56.66]This is a late-night stream.
[190:58.34]I said it was going to be a late-night stream, so we're going to commit to a late-night stream.
[191:17.27]Effective.
[191:27.52]Come on, stick your head over here.
[191:34.85]That's that way.
[191:35.69]Let me go over here.
[191:40.09]Yeah, it's only been three hours.
[191:42.67]And I'm pretty alert still.
[191:45.86]Oh, shit.
[191:51.96]Oh, my goodness.
[191:56.35]Don't let this guy kill you.
[192:05.51]Alright, dude.
[192:06.39]Come on.
[192:06.83]Relax.
[192:07.70]This is horseshit.
[192:17.88]Whatever.
[192:25.96]Good.
[192:27.82]Alright, that's enough for this area.
[192:32.39]Can't mark it, but I don't think I need to.
[192:38.77]So I can go straight.
[192:39.37]There's a Grace over there.
[192:40.25]Let me go back this way.
[192:40.89]Is there something I missed over here?
[192:47.95]I don't think so.
[192:49.49]I thought this was family friendly.
[192:52.88]I will be in a minute.
[192:57.16]Wait till the after hours.
[192:58.34]You know, when Cartoon Network goes to like 11 o'clock.
[193:01.50]They say like swears and shit.
[193:03.65]It's almost there.
[193:04.69]We're there.
[193:04.99]It's Jerma Adult Swim.
[193:07.90]Right?
[193:08.06]It's like my version of that.
[193:11.79]Imagine if somebody did that.
[193:14.87]Like from the hours of... I gotta pay attention here.
[193:20.69]From the hours of like, you know, 12 o'clock noon to like 10 o'clock at night, they're incredibly family friendly.
[193:28.85]They don't say swears.
[193:29.87]They don't play any, like, mature games.
[193:32.09]But then, like, 10 o'clock rolls around, and they're just, like, saying, like, oh, fuck this shit, piss asshole.
[193:38.07]They talk a bunch of shit.
[193:39.47]They play a bunch of mature games.
[193:41.29]That'd be, like, a funny... That'd be, like, a funny shtick, I think. ...
[193:59.06]That's literally you.
[194:03.10]Guys, I... My streams are... I've... What are you... That makes no sense to me.
[194:20.51]Keep going up.
[194:28.51]There's a boss up there.
[194:32.71]Well, I know where we're going.
[194:34.16]Okay.
[194:35.74]There's a legendary item over there.
[194:50.86]It used to be family friendly.
[194:52.34]Maybe for like seven months back in like 2011.
[195:06.14]Are these open?
[195:11.08]Okay, okay.
[195:14.12]Interesting.
[195:18.77]Oh, great sun.
[195:19.65]Frigid sun of soul.
[195:22.01]Surrender yourself to the eclipse.
[195:24.11]Grant life to the soulless bones.
[195:31.23]Eclipse shuttle.
[195:34.77]This is apparently a legendary.
[195:35.79]Did I miss it?
[195:58.35]Where is it?
[196:05.53]My shoulder hurts.
[196:50.52]So that guy walks in here.
[196:58.31]Very- okay, cool.
[196:59.43]So what- what was the weapon that I just found?
[197:07.70]I lost it again.
[197:08.68]There it is.
[197:10.26]Faith and Dex.
[197:12.88]Storied sword and treasure of Castle Sol that depicts an eclipsed sun drained of color.
[197:18.14]One of the legendary armaments.
[197:20.49]In Sol, the sight of an eclipse inspires a dreadful awe, preventing an onlooker from averting his gaze.
[197:27.17]Let the lustrous sun ablaze with the prince of death's flames, collecting the death ailment on foes.
[197:39.99]This is a broken PvP weapon.
[197:44.59]I can't use it, but I'm curious.
[197:55.52]Interesting.
[197:56.80]Cool.
[197:57.90]I'm going to sit at the bonfire, though, because that's an unnecessary amount of damage to take.
[198:04.23]Legendary shuttle.
[198:07.91]Let's just sit at the bonfire.
[198:11.33]That spell... This weapon used to instantly kill people.
[198:13.83]Is this the thing people were talking about?
[198:16.33]This is the one that would instantly kill, right?
[198:18.25]It was like an unbearable... Is he in the room again?
[198:25.43]It's Shotel.
[198:26.61]Whatever.
[198:33.01]Can't open that.
[198:33.51]Wait.
[198:46.73]Nothing over here.
[198:50.51]Okay, whatever.
[198:51.05]Alright, uh... I'll go up.
[199:02.74]What a bit of speed.
[199:15.74]Definitely using sorcerers a lot more at the end of the end game here.
[199:19.14]Ooh, wait a minute.
[199:21.30]Can I jump from here?
[199:27.58]No.
[199:39.48]Shit.
[199:42.23]I'm back.
[199:44.07]OK.
[199:59.87]End game, he says.
[200:00.93]I mean... End... Oh, hold on.
[200:05.14]Quiet.
[200:06.34]Yeah, sure.
[200:07.40]Whatever you say, dude.
[200:10.92]I would also like to swing 15 times in a row.
[200:14.09]That would be... I mean, it'd be cool if I could do that.
[200:16.35]If I would have the ability to do that many swings in a row.
[200:33.46]Try that again.
[200:45.38]Did I go this way yet?
[200:46.70]Hold on.
[200:49.70]Yeah, this is where I went right.
[200:51.24]I am this annoying guy.
[200:52.56]This is the worst enemy in the whole game.
[201:07.57]Well, I need to be much more prepared for that then.
[201:09.63]Maybe I should use a shield to parry him.
[201:27.25]Oh, you know what?
[201:27.87]What am I talking about?
[201:28.55]I am a sorceress.
[201:36.62]Good luck.
[201:38.31]The best part about being sorcery is you can just cheese the fuck out of everybody.
[201:44.53]I don't have to fight this guy.
[201:45.95]Somebody else can.
[201:50.94]Goodbye.
[201:52.44]See ya.
[201:52.72]I don't have to deal with that.
[201:56.38]Right.
[201:58.02]This is why sorcery and faith is just so good.
[202:03.95]They're just great.
[202:06.87]Because I can just go run up the ladder and hide.
[202:08.61]And I don't have to like... Imagine being just like a deck strength quality build.
[202:15.81]You'd be up there throwing fire pots.
[202:18.73]I think I already... I'm wearing this already.
[202:21.40]Except is this the better version of it?
[202:28.26]How is this one better?
[202:29.10]I found it like three zones ago.
[202:42.35]I think that's all I can do up here.
[202:49.37]Hold on.
[202:51.95]Hold on a second.
[202:54.25]Just a second here.
[202:55.29]Hold on a second.
[203:03.00]It's down here.
[203:21.15]I mean, that's a really suspicious place to put that if there's nothing here, right?
[203:26.55]Oh, it was just the other side.
[203:28.99]Okay.
[203:31.15]Well, I wanted to come down anyways because... Actually, let me... No, I'm not going to set the bonfire.
[203:35.64]Why would I do that?
[203:37.20]I want to go this way and I'm going to go up.
[203:45.82]How come you're wearing mommy's beach hat?
[203:58.60]Mommy's food chat.
[204:05.28]I wanted to go up from here.
[204:07.92]So I don't get sunburned.
[204:08.76]Yeah, so I don't get burnt.
[204:09.76]Remember the dogs?
[204:34.97]Oh shit.
[204:35.17]Okay, it's just one of these guys.
[204:37.79]One behind me too.
[204:38.33]Of course there is.
[204:39.15]Nope.
[204:42.55]Why can I not lock on?
[204:46.55]Who's throwing those?
[204:58.42]How can you throw that that far but I cannot?
[205:04.12]Am I still too far away?
[205:09.07]Whatever.
[205:09.61]Who cares?
[205:10.63]I killed the guy that was the distraction.
[205:13.85]Holy shit!
[205:14.87]Oh my god!
[205:39.78]Oh my god, I keep timing it so fucking wrong!
[205:51.34]What the fuck?
[205:51.98]There's another one right there!
[205:53.17]Holy shit!
[205:55.67]Oh my god!
[205:56.87]What the fuck?
[205:58.13]What?
[205:58.95]Why are there so many of these fucking things?
[206:02.63]Okay.
[206:04.95]What a pain in the ass.
[206:17.15]whatever that's so annoying uh should I maybe I should put a shield on just hold it out do a tea break alright if I if I get past this area I'll do a tea break won't be long now I know no it's I know it's there
[206:45.74]I could go that way too, but I need the souls.
[207:07.74]What the fuck?!
[207:09.70]I thought I could run by him!
[207:16.03]What do I do?
[207:19.90]There's nothing down there.
[207:20.58]Where do I go?
[207:22.92]I actually don't fucking know where I'm going.
[207:24.30]What happened?
[207:25.38]What the fuck happened here?
[207:27.14]What the fuck?
[207:28.56]Did I go the wrong way?
[207:29.50]Is there a way?
[207:33.15]That guy's un-fucking-bearable.
[207:34.95]Did I go the wrong way?
[207:44.48]I don't think that guy has, I don't think that guy has a stamina bar.
[207:47.78]You just swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing.
[207:50.34]Swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing.
[207:52.57]Swing, swing, swing.
[207:53.65]It's like, how do you fight that guy?
[207:54.81]How are you supposed to fight that fucking thing?
[207:56.91]How do you fight that thing?
[207:57.75]You don't even fight it.
[207:58.41]You don't even play the game.
[207:59.41]You just die.
[208:00.41]How do you fight the fucking guy?
[208:01.79]How do you fight that guy?
[208:02.61]You can't, you can't fight him.
[208:06.54]Alright, where, where?
[208:07.46]I don't, the souls are gone, so fucking whatever, who cares?
[208:21.20]this ball this area is just like a middle finger to the player it's just like yeah I just whatever just every corner you turn there's gonna be like something that just spawns in front of your face
[208:53.88]I see the elevator, which I believe is down here.
[208:57.28]I probably could go back to the front entrance.
[209:03.26]If I step on that, I'll go right up there, right?
[209:06.46]Do I have to pull the lever?
[209:15.26]You have to activate it?
[209:16.06]Alright, well, I'm just gonna run over there.
[209:19.50]No, I don't like this area.
[209:20.75]Fuck this area.
[209:22.98]Fuck the dual welding fucking assholes that kill you in fucking three hits and don't stop swinging.
[209:28.13]Good.
[209:32.69]Look, I don't give a shit.
[209:40.58]I don't think you can actually fight these guys.
[209:43.02]I don't think you can physically fight them.
[209:46.04]I think they're designed to be like obstacles.
[209:49.12]They're obstacles in the arena.
[209:51.90]It's like a spike trap.
[209:53.36]You can't even... Okay, well, I got the thing, so I'm going to go the other way.
[210:09.18]You literally stagger them.
[210:10.40]Good luck getting a swing off, and if you miss, you're dead.
[210:15.40]Prime rolling.
[210:17.27]No, no, quiet.
[210:18.93]I'm not going to hear this.
[210:22.15]Quiet.
[210:29.01]Okay, so the elevator was here, right?
[210:33.20]A little bit further down.
[210:38.32]Where's the elevator?
[210:42.02]Back here?
[210:46.46]Wasn't there an elevator, like, right here?
[210:47.66]Is it further down?
[210:52.26]Oh, it's this room, okay, yeah.
[210:53.66]Alright, yeah.
[211:06.16]Fuck all that.
[211:06.64]What do you mean contraption does not move?
[211:11.55]It just did it.
[211:15.69]Why is that not happening?
[211:20.86]I have to stand on top of it.
[211:22.68]Do I really have to do that?
[211:47.36]Yeah, this is the wrong place.
[211:51.54]I have to ride it once.
[211:55.39]Okay.
[211:56.45]Can I summon here?
[211:57.65]No, you can't even summon here.
[211:58.65]I was going to say, just get the boys out here.
[212:00.79]And I'll just fucking sacrifice them and run.
[212:02.73]Okay.
[212:07.69]Here we go.
[212:14.97]I have an idea.
[212:24.24]That's like the most physical defense, this, right?
[212:28.07]This has... Okay, here we go.
[212:31.95]I was going to hold the fucking shield out and run.
[212:37.52]What?
[212:38.16]Wait!
[212:48.37]What?
[213:01.35]stop fucking you are so annoying like holy shit get the fuck out of here like you just how many of these do you get to have endless goddamn supply of magical bombs alright get over here
[213:25.10]oh where wait where do we go where are we he's right behind me ah I can see his shadow that's my shadow
[214:00.15]Hey, these guys are the fucking worst.
[214:07.83]Okay.
[214:09.15]Well, it's activated now, so I don't have to worry about this shit.
[214:24.45]I was supposed to see who the boss is.
[214:26.33]What is the boss?
[214:31.03]You didn't get in.
[214:31.72]Commander Niel.
[215:00.42]Okay, here's the play.
[215:01.10]The play is drink this.
[215:03.36]I'm going from here now.
[215:09.46]The play is to drink that.
[215:10.74]Shit.
[215:15.88]Drink the thing to make infinite spells.
[215:19.84]And then... Spam that boon blade.
[215:26.39]And try to kill the guy on the right first.
[215:29.55]As fast as I can.
[215:31.07]Do I also have access to the boys?
[215:32.45]Do I?
[215:32.65]Okay.
[215:47.90]If I have access to the boys, then I'll do it.
[215:51.45]I'm going to drink this before going in the room.
[215:53.51]Right when I go in the room, some of the boys.
[215:55.25]And then just spam the Moonblade.
[216:01.65]And hopefully I kill the guy on the right before he even gets over to me.
[216:07.29]I'm safe, right?
[216:08.01]Do I have to run away from anybody?
[216:09.54]No, thank God.
[216:10.94]At least I have the decency to make it so you don't have to fight one of those guys on the way here.
[216:13.86]Alright, here we go.
[216:25.96]Boys, get out of the way.
[216:38.50]Oh, he's going to hit.
[216:39.12]Alright.
[216:40.63]It worked.
[216:40.93]It worked.
[216:41.17]It worked.
[216:41.41]Good call.
[216:41.81]Good call.
[216:42.49]We're good.
[216:43.63]Alright.
[216:45.57]Get him.
[216:55.40]Alright.
[217:05.10]Holy shit.
[217:05.44]What does that mean?
[217:19.83]Holy fuck.
[217:35.77]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no way.
[217:42.55]Oh, no.
[217:43.41]Okay.
[217:44.07]It was a good strategy.
[217:47.37]That's how I'm going to play that out.
[217:48.51]That's a good strategy.
[217:49.23]It is.
[217:57.44]It was boys.
[217:59.30]Flask.
[218:00.82]I gotta wait to spam it though.
[218:02.59]I was a little early.
[218:03.25]I think I can drink the flask after summoning the boys.
[218:10.47]No, no, no, no, no.
[218:11.01]Why would I do that?
[218:11.55]Because the boys will be free.
[218:21.95]Because I thought he summoned him instantly.
[218:24.38]So he takes a minute.
[218:25.32]He's like, here I go.
[218:26.42]I'm going to summon.
[218:27.02]So I just get in there.
[218:31.04]Drink the flask.
[218:32.22]Summon the boys.
[218:33.16]And then by that point... That should be good.
[218:43.40]It took a lot longer to summon those two than I thought.
[218:45.26]That's why I did it instantly.
[218:46.92]Okay, here we go.
[219:04.61]There we go.
[219:12.31]Oh!
[219:12.55]Okay, did I get him?
[219:19.03]Only one guy left.
[219:20.29]Alright, we're fine.
[219:21.31]Good, good, good, good, good.
[219:25.40]Dude!
[219:25.64]What the fuck, man?
[219:26.80]Come on, get him.
[219:28.74]We're good.
[219:43.10]Alright, he does a follow-up.
[219:44.20]It's a follow-up swing.
[219:56.09]Dude, he does two follow-ups after that.
[219:57.77]Fuck.
[220:02.95]I might have to get rid of this spell now.
[220:09.94]Shit.
[220:10.46]Hold on, back it up.
[220:19.00]Alright, you gotta get away.
[220:19.76]You don't want to be near this guy for more than a second.
[220:30.19]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[220:31.25]You gotta jump.
[220:32.05]No, you don't.
[220:32.41]I don't know.
[220:32.83]Okay.
[220:51.93]Oh my goodness!
[220:53.31]Alright, I gotta be quicker.
[221:06.11]I gotta be much quicker.
[221:12.82]Timing's on that.
[221:13.34]I got it wrong a little bit.
[221:20.26]No!
[221:22.04]No, not good.
[221:23.22]Not good.
[221:23.60]I think you just need to get out.
[221:36.31]Oh, okay.
[221:37.53]Alright, alright, alright.
[221:39.47]So, here's what has to happen.
[221:42.98]When he does that, like, dash in swing, I don't think there's enough time to do the carrion sword.
[221:51.23]Even if I get, like, a perfect dodge.
[221:53.53]Because it's like, it takes a little bit too long to be able to dodge that second, like, boom attack.
[222:00.59]So I'm not going to use it.
[222:01.69]I'm just going to use my weaponry.
[222:08.00]He's the mimic tier?
[222:09.22]I mean, the boys are doing great.
[222:11.68]I got it, I got it.
[222:12.30]It's just the timing is... It's all about when he does that dash in.
[222:19.51]I think it's just a single R2.
[222:20.97]Or maybe just swing at him once and then get away.
[222:26.25]I wonder if I can... Jump over it.
[222:31.92]Can I jump over that attack when he goes like... With a lightning?
[222:34.40]Can I jump?
[222:36.00]I think I can.
[222:43.82]Maybe even, um, Flintstone.
[222:47.69]I'll try it.
[222:48.43]I definitely need to use this in the very beginning.
[222:50.43]There's no way I can do this without it.
[222:51.55]Just have to get away.
[222:58.88]We'll try it.
[222:59.24]Let's go.
[223:00.68]I feel like that was pretty close.
[223:01.96]Although, I feel like at least a few of these attempts are going to get really fucked up by this part here.
[223:07.43]Just not killing these things fast enough.
[223:24.04]Get the fuck away from me!
[223:41.94]But hey, what's he doing?
[223:45.08]here we go does it two three times hard to tell actually not that bad but once the boys are gone I'll be in trouble here
[224:17.26]Fuck, not again!
[224:22.48]Okay, let's go.
[224:33.59]That timing on that, I gotta get it right.
[224:35.05]It's a lot longer.
[224:42.65]No, I don't think I can even do an R1.
[224:58.27]Shit, I'm in a fucking wall here.
[224:59.72]Maybe just one R1 and get out.
[225:09.55]Okay, that works.
[225:35.24]so so so
[226:02.85]Thank you.
[226:37.76]damn once his friends are gone it's just about the timings damn that was crazy that's fun but holy that beginning my god okay if you don't have if you don't have sorcery do you just have to run around and just kite that around so you can kill those two
[227:01.54]I can't imagine that as a strength user.
[227:04.00]That must be un-fucking-belo- That must be un-bearable as, like, a melee-only character.
[227:10.86]How are you supposed to do that?
[227:11.86]That seems impossible.
[227:13.86]Strength is fine.
[227:14.60]It seems so hard.
[227:17.15]That was cool.
[227:21.93]Alright, we're good.
[227:22.99]Goddamn.
[227:27.91]Ugh.
[227:31.22]Summons can carry that?
[227:32.10]Yeah.
[227:37.78]He just sits back and will buff until you attack him.
[227:40.26]Really?
[227:45.38]Alright.
[227:45.76]Now we can finally do the staff.
[227:51.88]But, hold on.
[227:52.50]There's probably some lore shit in here.
[228:03.09]That was a cool fight though.
[228:03.97]I just do not look forward to doing that as like a short sword character.
[228:10.87]I feel like that would be really difficult.
[228:14.05]Hold on, wait, don't just run around.
[228:18.01]Oh, the weapon.
[228:18.53]Yeah, let's see what it was.
[228:23.93]What was it?
[228:32.30]What kind of weapon was it?
[228:33.16]Is it right here?
[228:40.35]Veteran's prosthesis.
[228:42.57]Strength and dex.
[228:46.99]Like a fist weapon?
[228:48.49]Yeah.
[228:49.81]Bladed prosthetic leg and wreath with the power of lightning.
[228:54.43]Instead attached to the fist.
[228:56.83]Commander Nial, veteran of Castle Sol, offered this prosthesis in exchange for the lives of defeated knights held prisoner.
[229:04.65]He went on to lead these men as an army of no nation.
[229:07.95]Storm kick.
[229:11.25]Can't use it.
[229:13.00]Light- Oh, it's that thing he was doing.
[229:17.28]Oh, that's actually kind of cool.
[229:29.85]that's pretty cool alright we can go pee in just a moment I promise I want to see what else is here
[229:47.75]And then we might consider wrapping up soon.
[229:50.35]Not right this second, but soon.
[229:55.52]I would say maybe like another hour.
[230:00.44]We'll see.
[230:02.76]After we get this lore dump, whatever it is.
[230:05.82]We'll take a break.
[230:06.48]I'll come back, maybe stream for like another hour or two.
[230:09.12]Maybe.
[230:09.40]I don't want to go too, too long.
[230:13.02]So what's up here?
[230:29.57]Haligtree's secret medallion left.
[230:35.79]Lord Nicola, forgive me.
[230:39.58]The sun has not been swallowed.
[230:41.22]Our prayers were lacking.
[230:43.58]Your comrade remains soulless.
[230:45.74]I will never set my eyes upon it now.
[230:47.66]Your divine Haligtree.
[230:58.58]Okay, well I have half of the Haligtree Medallion.
[231:06.47]Very interesting.
[231:08.97]I'm kind of curious what that is.
[231:12.11]Do you want medallions to operate Grand Lift of World?
[231:22.01]Branching the medallion with both halves conjoined will activate the Grand Lift of Rold, granting access to a hidden path.
[231:28.43]In other words, this secret medallion will guide the bearer to the land of Miquella's Haligtree.
[231:35.25]What is a Haligtree?
[231:49.12]It's a special tree.
[231:54.50]Well, very interesting.
[232:04.08]The game wants me to go down here.
[232:05.36]So here's what we're going to do.
[232:10.89]I am going to take a pee break.
[232:17.13]We're going to go here.
[232:17.81]And we're going to check out this area.
[232:22.73]Preferably maybe this right here.
[232:25.51]Maybe take a little gander over here.
[232:29.51]And then ultimately I want to end up there.
[232:32.51]So let's mark that.
[232:41.03]You have the other half.
[232:41.87]I don't think so.
[232:56.46]I have this one.
[232:57.02]Please, I have to pee right now.
[233:04.94]Alright, no, I know.
[233:05.52]We're doing it.
[233:05.96]And when I come back, I'm going to do the staff.
[233:08.68]Yeah, I'll be right back.
[233:09.46]Just go pee.
[233:10.44]Those of you that are going to bed, we'll see you later.
[233:13.82]I don't think I'm streaming tomorrow.
[233:15.71]Although, I've been wrong the last four or five days before.
[233:19.01]So, let's just see where this goes.
[233:21.47]I don't plan on streaming tomorrow.
[233:24.25]I didn't plan on streaming tonight either.
[233:25.45]So, just keep an eye on Sus.
[233:27.65]I might show up and change it.
[233:29.77]We might not stream for another day or two.
[233:31.15]I don't know.
[233:32.87]I'm kind of up in the air.
[233:33.71]Depends on how badly I want to play.
[233:35.55]So, we'll see.
[233:37.17]Be right back.
[239:19.58]He's uninstalling Elden Ring right now.
[239:22.18]Thank God, somebody said.
[239:29.77]Alright.
[239:30.45]First order of business.
[239:32.23]The very first order of business.
[239:35.68]Crush these.
[239:39.72]Back to the round table hold.
[239:46.85]How many Elden Ring streams have you done?
[239:48.28]Um... Hi.
[240:00.86]I just fucking destroyed this person.
[240:07.12]Um... Isn't it illegal to fight here?
[240:13.39]What?
[240:13.87]Okay.
[240:23.30]Apparently not.
[240:27.06]What was that?
[240:35.78]You got invaded?
[240:41.76]Why did that just happen this late?
[240:43.16]Is that why I fucking destroyed it?
[240:49.31]That was just like one, two, three, ugh!
[240:52.85]Oh, it's from the medallion.
[240:54.25]Okay.
[240:54.89]That makes sense.
[240:57.93]Alright, what is it?
[240:58.67]An arm?
[240:58.99]It looks like a bone arm.
[241:15.42]Where the fuck is it?
[241:17.54]Oh, there it is.
[241:18.96]Arcane and Dex.
[241:21.39]Clinging bone.
[241:22.81]Horrific weapon made of a hardened skeletal arm wielded by Ensha of the Royal Remains.
[241:29.46]Fitted by placing one hand into the fist until it digs in.
[241:33.74]A clinging creature.
[241:34.50]A king relinquishes not the hand.
[241:39.63]Doing this IRL is cool.
[241:40.93]What is it doing?
[241:41.75]Look at me.
[241:43.13]That's cool.
[241:43.81]Okay, well that was weird.
[241:48.28]Interesting.
[242:02.23]It's the person that's been staring at me the entire video game.
[242:08.56]What was that for?
[242:26.48]Helm graced with gold human bones, worn by the unspeaking adherent of Sir Gideon the All-Knowing.
[242:33.68]Slowly replenishes HP when HP is reduced.
[242:38.43]Bones belong to an ancient lord of the soulless king, the lord of the lost and desperate, who was known as Ensha.
[242:46.65]Okay.
[242:52.18]Ancient lord.
[242:56.70]Term of twerk.
[242:58.56]Talk to Gideon.
[243:00.88]About Ensha.
[243:03.50]Okay.
[243:26.89]I've already done it!
[243:28.89]I did it already!
[243:50.21]Okay.
[243:50.49]What the fuck is happening in chat?
[243:51.65]Write that down.
[243:52.65]I'm not writing down the pot dance.
[243:54.82]Alright, so I could do that, but the most important thing right at this very moment is...
[244:17.79]I thought, wait, first of all, let me ask this.
[244:20.25]I thought you couldn't fight in here.
[244:31.43]You're not supposed to.
[244:34.47]So they just broke the rules.
[244:37.19]It's not that you... It's a special thing.
[244:40.73]It was bizarro world.
[244:41.73]Okay, go get the medallion.
[244:43.27]Alright, just wait, wait, listen.
[244:46.07]I need to do this first because this is important.
[244:48.29]I need a Somber Smithing Stone, don't I?
[244:52.24]I do.
[244:52.52]Okay, hold on.
[244:54.74]Somber Smithing Stone.
[244:59.54]L stream, L gamer.
[245:04.79]We can do all this other stuff the next stream.
[245:07.39]Don't, I mean, look, we're not rushing through the game.
[245:12.35]How much is the Sombersmithing Stone?
[245:13.61]One.
[245:13.89]Three?
[245:20.65]Doesn't the Giant sell it?
[245:23.01]Giant sells them over here, right?
[245:24.15]Giant sells one through four.
[245:36.15]Maybe I should buy a bunch.
[245:38.13]I don't think I have.
[245:45.29]I have nine twos, two threes.
[245:47.95]I'm going to need a few of these.
[245:52.15]Right?
[245:52.75]Because I have up until eight to get to plus eight.
[245:57.88]So I need some more fours and I need some more threes as well, right?
[246:05.08]Or is it one per upgrade?
[246:06.58]Oh, that's right.
[246:07.16]It's not like the regular spinning stones.
[246:10.89]One, two, three, four.
[246:13.25]I'm going to sneeze.
[246:17.89]I had nowhere to go.
[246:20.31]Oh wait, you have something to say about this.
[246:21.61]Unthinkable.
[246:24.15]How could Blaidd?
[246:25.69]How did he break free from his cell?
[246:28.45]No.
[246:29.97]More importantly, Blaidd became a curse that plagued Lady Ranni.
[246:35.86]Yet even in madness, gave himself to her.
[246:40.28]I've made a grave misjudgment.
[246:43.69]And I thought myself a capable war counselor.
[246:47.59]I'll catch up with you soon enough, Blaidd.
[246:50.68]When I do... I only hope... Did you pass up that talisman?
[246:55.76]I didn't even look at it.
[246:58.90]Lowest FP consumed by skills.
[247:02.48]What?
[247:02.76]Holy shit.
[247:03.30]That's pretty good.
[247:03.86]Alright.
[247:08.69]Okay.
[247:12.01]I can do this now.
[247:16.39]It vastly raises max FP, raises intelligence.
[247:19.31]Spells consume less FP, raises potency of sorceries.
[247:24.33]So, why would I use this if I have this one?
[247:30.16]Right?
[247:30.34]I get my HP back.
[247:41.00]Because a skill is not a spell.
[247:45.60]Oh, god damn it.
[247:46.81]What a waste.
[247:51.86]Reload the area.
[247:52.68]Reload the area.
[247:53.40]Okay.
[248:13.22]Good thing I bought the fucking one Smithing Stone instead of buying like a hundred.
[248:18.74]Oh.
[248:28.40]What's wrong with him?
[248:30.16]Can I talk to him?
[248:30.56]Can I reload the area again?
[248:42.60]What is going on in this world?
[248:44.32]I don't get it.
[249:01.29]Easily broken and weak against striking attacks.
[249:04.31]Formed by those committed to high treason.
[249:07.33]It wards off the intervention of the greater will and its vessel fingers.
[249:14.30]Wards off the intervention of the greater will.
[249:21.59]Well, shit.
[249:25.98]Hey.
[249:28.88]What's wrong with these people?
[249:31.68]What's going on?
[249:34.63]It's a tinfoil hat.
[249:38.69]Okay.
[249:39.99]Very nice.
[249:40.71]Let's now go back to the round table.
[249:49.32]We should go to Selavus's tower too.
[249:55.02]Let me do this first.
[249:55.68]I'm not going to be able to get this up that high, I don't think.
[249:59.01]But I'm going to use all the stones that I have.
[250:03.33]Finally.
[250:04.25]It only took four hours.
[250:06.90]Only took four hours.
[250:11.13]Here we go, finally.
[250:13.15]That's the wrong one, isn't it?
[250:14.39]No, it's not.
[250:14.75]Okay.
[250:15.59]Here we go.
[250:17.55]Plus one.
[250:18.45]+2.
[250:21.38]Plus three.
[250:22.60]Plus four.
[250:23.82]Plus five.
[250:25.84]Plus six.
[250:26.90]Plus seven.
[250:28.02]Plus eight.
[250:32.43]This is now 274... 262?
[250:36.73]This is better.
[250:38.15]This thing scales on strength weirdly enough.
[250:46.08]New staff.
[250:52.04]262.
[250:52.30]Yeah, that is better scaling.
[250:53.64]You're right.
[250:53.96]How does it look?
[250:56.26]Pretty cool.
[251:01.71]Very cool.
[251:02.23]Alright, so now I got that.
[251:03.31]I'm happy with this.
[251:08.95]That's the wrong... What do I mean?
[251:10.17]That's the wrong one.
[251:20.86]Spinning weapon.
[251:22.28]That's annoying.
[251:29.13]Uh, do I have any... Can I upgrade anybody else?
[251:30.83]I cannot.
[251:36.47]Alright, that was cool.
[251:38.67]I am now going to do what I set out to do before.
[251:41.49]I know that I can go get the other half of that medallion.
[251:44.87]We're saving that.
[251:45.75]I'm not doing that at the moment.
[251:48.45]I want to go down here.
[251:49.79]I want to explore this part, and then the stream is ending.
[251:53.01]So let's just check this area down here.
[251:55.81]Go back to... Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[251:58.65]Alright.
[251:59.63]Just hold on.
[252:02.99]I gotta go here, you're saying?
[252:11.53]Just don't forget.
[252:12.13]I won't forget.
[252:12.65]I'm sure you guys will remind me in the next three days.
[252:16.41]Okay, here we go.
[252:23.36]It's saying to go this way.
[252:27.20]Don't end?
[252:28.16]I mean, it's like 1230 Pacific.
[252:30.16]It's like so late for so many people.
[252:34.43]We'll be back.
[252:34.89]We'll be back.
[252:35.49]I don't know if it's going to be tomorrow, but we'll be back.
[252:39.25]You should be expecting to just be random Elden Ring screams.
[252:42.83]Like, every other day or something.
[252:45.45]It really just depends on when I get the urge.
[252:47.83]I want to play now.
[252:54.13]I'm in the wrong goddamn way.
[252:55.41]Alright, just turn around.
[253:02.79]It's early in Germany right now?
[253:04.13]Yeah, it's probably like, what, 8 o'clock in the morning?
[253:05.69]9 o'clock in the morning?
[253:13.50]That way.
[253:25.62]So, how many full moon spells are in the game?
[253:31.16]There are actually only like two.
[253:32.40]There really are only two.
[253:37.58]So I'm gonna have to get the other resemblance then, right?
[253:52.59]You already have one?
[253:53.29]I already have one?
[253:57.17]Okay, so he's dead.
[254:02.25]Everyone's just dying.
[254:08.86]Elvis' bell bearing, his hat, his gown, arrow.
[254:12.64]Okay, all this other stuff.
[254:20.54]Puppet.
[254:22.88]Finger... Wait, are these summons?
[254:24.12]These are summons.
[254:26.88]Summon Spirit of Finger Maiden Theralina.
[254:32.69]Spirit of Finger Maiden who never met the tarnish she was meant to guide uses healing incantations and holy water pots.
[254:39.23]She is not a fighter by nature and is ill-suited for battle.
[254:43.83]A maiden without a tarnish, a tarnish without a maiden, and yet no guide to bring them together.
[254:53.29]Spirit of a man who wished to become the innards of a Living Jar.
[254:56.75]A jar-hurling specialist who throws all manner of pots and jars.
[255:02.55]The warrior jar once told the nameless man this.
[255:05.68]You are not ready to join the warriors inside.
[255:07.52]No, you must apply yourself.
[255:09.84]Better yourself, and one day I will return for you.
[255:16.38]Can we buy them?
[255:17.58]They cost starlight shards.
[255:19.67]Hopefully that wasn't a stupid idea.
[255:26.47]Well, I never gave... Didn't he... Sorry, Salamis.
[255:31.55]It took me too long to find the person to give the potion to.
[255:36.55]Seems to have fucking died of old age.
[255:48.08]Where is it?
[255:55.94]Oops.
[255:57.34]Okay, does that... Do you have any spells?
[255:59.96]Like, is it plus spells?
[256:06.09]Large hat with the movements of the stars drawn on the inside of the brim.
[256:10.15]Worn by the magic preceptors who serve the Carrion Royals.
[256:13.29]Increases mind to the detriment of stamina.
[256:16.99]I don't want that.
[256:20.20]Cool, though.
[256:24.23]People die of old age in this game?
[256:25.75]I don't know.
[256:32.92]I don't think so.
[256:39.44]Upstairs.
[256:42.78]Haven't I already been up here?
[256:54.72]Wasn't there a memory stone up here or something?
[257:00.22]Yeah, I got whatever it is.
[257:01.23]I got it.
[257:05.01]In the wall?
[257:05.65]In the wall outside the outside wall.
[257:47.30]Where?
[257:51.47]He's not doing it on purpose.
[257:52.87]Dude, oh my god, the wall.
[257:54.09]What?
[257:54.47]I'm west side facing west.
[257:56.25]West side facing west.
[258:02.76]Lay down here?
[258:03.26]I'm fucking dead.
[258:28.92]Is that a secret wall?
[258:47.93]Here?
[259:07.71]Is there actually some shit up here?
[259:16.25]Oh, wait.
[259:23.57]Was this here before?
[259:24.43]Black wolf mask.
[259:41.93]Mask fashioned after the head of a black wolf.
[259:45.87]Relic of an assassin who assumed the guise of Randy the Witch's loyal shadow.
[259:51.07]The likeness is striking.
[260:02.21]So wait, were we... Were we talking to an assassin the whole time?
[260:07.20]It's like kind of awful.
[260:11.04]Alright.
[260:16.12]I got his bell, right?
[260:21.08]I might have to turn the stream off sooner than I thought.
[260:26.60]I want to go do this.
[260:27.24]I want to see.
[260:35.09]The assassin in the underground that looked like Blade was wearing a mask.
[260:40.17]What's their problem?
[260:49.40]That's the Mask of the Baleful Shadow.
[260:51.12]Okay, so... Alright.
[261:03.41]Very cool.
[261:07.45]Carrion Phalanx.
[261:08.37]Carrion Retaliation.
[261:10.35]Ice Crag.
[261:12.65]And Freezing Mist.
[261:14.94]Well...
[261:21.19]I think we're gonna have to get these.
[261:22.25]Frag and mist.
[261:25.61]I'll get them both.
[261:28.05]Do I have enough souls?
[261:31.47]Fuck.
[261:32.93]I need more- I need more runes!
[261:34.74]Should I just sell some shit that I'm not gonna use?
[261:52.12]It's alright, I'll be back.
[261:54.66]Let me at least put this on.
[261:56.20]And replace it with, like, Night Comet.
[261:58.34]Oh, I took Night Comet off.
[262:00.26]Uh, we're gonna replace, uh, Great Glintstone Shard.
[262:06.17]With Glintstone Ice Crag.
[262:08.09]And I have another cold thing too, don't I?
[262:11.69]Frost Staff in the ground.
[262:15.44]Freezing Tornado.
[262:18.70]Yeah, let's just, let's put all, like, the cold shit on.
[262:20.69]Why not?
[262:21.15]That's what I'm doing.
[262:22.07]This thing is, this is a moon.
[262:26.65]Cold, dark moon.
[262:29.17]And it's, ooh, alright.
[262:35.52]And it's 68.
[262:38.22]And then stylites still there, but it's alright.
[262:43.62]Ice Storm, Ice Crag, Granny's Darkmoon, and then Starlight is going to have to come out.
[262:49.97]Eventually.
[262:52.47]Cool.
[262:59.22]Alright, now I'm actually going to go do the thing that I was doing before.
[263:03.98]And we're only going to... I just want to take a look.
[263:07.74]Okay, still got a lot to do.
[263:11.05]But I do want to see what's down here.
[263:12.67]This is where we're going.
[263:14.51]For the next, like, 20-30 minutes, we're just going to go check this out a little bit and just check it out.
[263:18.03]Okay, here we go.
[263:24.34]Got my glintstone ice crag.
[263:28.64]We want to go straight over here.
[263:33.89]Stream's going to end at precisely 1 a.m.
[263:54.30]oh my goodness your fire moves okay that moves that's just like a cool glint stone uh I can't do anything else but that's fine this cannot be charged

[265:31.54]The fingers.
[265:32.56]The fingers.
[265:33.26]The hands.
[265:35.26]These hands are going to have something weird going on.
[265:37.17]Some role that it played.
[265:53.68]it's so much easier on horseback smithing's on seven what do you got more down here
[266:15.36]Oh, shit.
[266:18.42]Okay.
[266:25.39]What were you guarding down here?
[266:26.35]A lot of nothing.
[266:30.69]They do have Smithing Stone 7, which is really cool.
[266:34.57]They make me think of Zelda.
[266:36.49]Yeah, they do.
[266:37.14]That's true.
[266:37.76]They're fucking weird.
[266:39.94]Alright.
[266:44.22]Just...
[266:46.20]Go here?
[266:47.74]How far away is that?
[266:49.82]Let's check around the corner here.
[266:57.28]There's gonna be something here, right?
[267:03.72]A dungeon, probably.
[267:04.66]Yeah, there's a dungeon here.
[267:05.56]I guarantee it.
[267:06.13]They're not?
[267:13.13]No, they have to be, right?
[267:18.68]Nevermind.
[267:21.96]I don't need to kill this.
[267:37.05]One of these are gonna start moving, I think.
[267:38.41]I wouldn't be surprised.
[267:45.44]Oh shit.
[267:48.48]What's that?
[267:48.90]Let's check it out.
[267:52.32]Can I see your staves real quick?
[267:56.92]Yeah.
[267:59.34]Yes, you can.
[268:01.71]And... I'm going to call it up here.
[268:08.67]Whatever this is, this is the last thing I'm going to do tonight.
[268:14.66]Good thing I did that.
[268:15.42]I freaked out.
[268:15.82]I thought that was the edge.

[269:04.31]Next stream will be... Today's technically Thursday.
[269:13.63]Let's get a game plan here.
[269:15.54]Because... The 29th... Me and... Where's my voice?
[269:22.50]It's just gone.
[269:24.20]Me and Ludwig are going to do a stream together.
[269:26.29]We're going to do, I think, bro versus bro.
[269:27.57]I'm going to get a calendar.
[269:36.56]Alright.
[269:38.25]Here is the real plan.
[269:40.27]Are you ready?
[269:47.73]We're gonna go... Live... On Saturday, the 26th.
[269:58.20]And Sunday, the 27th.
[269:59.64]That's the plan.
[270:01.50]That is the next planned stream.
[270:02.84]Now, you might get something.
[270:03.88]I might show up tomorrow.
[270:05.96]But the sus- I know I said Thursday.
[270:08.45]You said Thursday, Friday.
[270:10.73]I know.
[270:11.87]But I streamed today.
[270:13.93]And... I have to do- I have to do my fucking taxes.
[270:18.77]So, uh... We gotta get on that.
[270:21.19]Because I've got like three weeks before the deadline.
[270:27.15]Uh, so... So today is technically Thursday.
[270:33.71]No, that's way too long, isn't it?
[270:37.01]Thursday, Friday... Yeah, I don't know.
[270:42.17]Okay, yeah.
[270:42.73]That gets me a whole day to do it.
[270:44.13]That's fine.
[270:45.40]Alright, so I'll see you guys Saturday, Sunday.
[270:47.54]And then we're gonna go to... I imagine that by Sunday we're gonna conclude Elden Ring.
[270:53.60]Temporarily.
[270:55.72]I think I'm gonna get near the end of the game two streams from now.
[271:03.45]It's... Maybe.
[271:04.63]Maybe.
[271:09.28]It's very possible.
[271:14.05]So.
[271:15.77]Let's just plan for Saturday.
[271:16.71]Depending on what happens Saturday.
[271:18.65]I don't know.
[271:19.63]Maybe I'll just fucking on Friday.
[271:21.07]Who cares?
[271:22.01]I'm going live.
[271:24.23]I've done the last two streams in a row.
[271:26.89]So it's possible.
[271:28.57]Plan for Saturday.
[271:29.39]At least.
[271:32.74]And then we've got the bro versus bro on the 29th.
[271:34.40]Which is Tuesday.
[271:36.60]Yeah.
[271:37.12]That should be good to go.
[271:39.32]Let me just look and see what's outside here.
[271:40.96]Yeah, it's a dungeon.
[271:43.24]Giant Conquering Hero's Grave.
[271:44.88]Okay, cool.
[271:49.58]The other half of the... Yeah, we'll do a full cleanup.
[271:53.00]I'll go get a bunch of stuff that I didn't do.
[271:55.04]I'm just very curious what's in here.
[272:00.02]What is this?
[272:00.38]I'm not going to fight anything.
[272:02.98]It's a free item.
[272:06.97]Flame Protect Me.
[272:11.94]Fire spell?
[272:17.26]Yeah, it's a dungeon.
[272:18.22]We'll start here.
[272:18.88]Take a look at what the spell is.
[272:21.10]Because, you know, everyone's going to freak out about it.
[272:24.88]Faith?
[272:26.12]Greatly increases fire damage negation.
[272:30.15]During the war against the giants long ago.
[272:31.95]There's so many factions.
[272:36.75]Go to bed.
[272:37.25]I know, I know.
[272:38.39]This is the end.
[272:40.21]Rest here at the Grace.
[272:41.01]I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[272:43.93]Saturday's stream is not going to be at like 9 p.m., okay?
[272:47.28]We're going to go back to try to go back to normal.
[272:49.62]I've been really itching to continue to play this game.
[272:52.40]So, but I'm going to put a lid on it because I want to start Saturday at like 4, normal time.
[273:01.33]Not start at like 8.30.
[273:02.35]I'll go get Otto.
[273:06.03]I'll be right back.
[273:06.57]We'll show Otto for a minute, for a second or two.
[273:10.62]Um, we'll have, yeah, I'll be right back.
[273:13.25]Let's put this on at least until I come back.
[273:14.91]Thank you for watching, everybody.
[273:16.81]Really appreciate it.
[273:17.65]We'll come back with Otto.
[273:18.55]Let me go grab him.
[273:21.05]Thanks for all the subs.
[273:22.13]There were a lot of community subs tonight.
[273:26.82]Thank you guys, as always.
[273:30.18]As you know, though, I do not read subs really or bits anymore.
[273:36.20]I do not.
[273:37.86]On pretty rare occasions do I do that.
[273:40.24]I used to.
[273:40.68]That's okay.
[273:54.19]I missed the post-stream hangouts.
[273:57.28]Yeah, but they were... They just, they had to go.
[274:00.38]They really did.
[274:03.01]I told you the two or three reasons why, right?
[274:04.79]It's, you know, you got... I don't want people to, like, pay me money for me to, like, read a message and talk to them.
[274:12.26]Right?
[274:12.54]It's like, oh, yeah, it costs $5 to get me to read your message guaranteed and respond to it.
[274:17.97]I don't... I'm not into that.
[274:19.15]I don't want to do that anymore.
[274:23.41]Um... As well as the fact that we used to do... The channel's gotten a lot larger, too, so it's just...
[274:32.18]there might be so many messages that might take hours and hours.
[274:34.70]It already did a lot of times take an extra one to two hours at the end of every stream.
[274:38.99]So if I streamed for like four or five hours, a lot of times I would cut the streams shorter because I knew there was probably an hour or two left of kind of reading messages and bits and stuff.
[274:50.38]So now I can just kind of go as long as I really want to.
[274:55.48]And there's not like a thing in the back of my mind that says,
[275:00.37]Dude, you gotta be aware that you gotta have enough energy to do like an hour or two at least of reading the bits.
[275:08.07]So that kind of stuff combined together.
[275:10.26]All the health stuff, like it was sitting down for more than seven to eight hours was kind of too much for me at some point, right?
[275:17.44]I do appreciate it.
[275:18.34]I do appreciate anybody that gives this channel subs or gives any money to this.
[275:22.76]But, you know, as you know at this point.
[275:28.59]The subs on this channel, there's a lot.
[275:30.81]And I don't think I need to tell you guys to continue to do that.
[275:35.55]I don't think I need to tell you, like, oh yeah, here's the incentive for giving me money.
[275:40.00]I don't think I need to have that.
[275:41.90]I don't really want that anymore.
[275:43.64]So, that's pretty much all there is to it.
[275:52.27]If somebody wants to give me $5 a month, I'm not going to stop them.
[275:57.10]But I'm not going to necessarily, like, encourage people to, yeah, give me, like, $20 and I'll read, like, two or three things that you said at the end of the stream.
[276:05.04]Yeah, just give me that money.
[276:06.04]I'll read it.
[276:08.67]That's going to be gone forever.
[276:12.37]But let me go get Otto.
[276:13.63]I'll be right back.
[276:55.13]He knows there's a treat.
[276:57.29]He's right here.
[276:59.09]God, he needs to lose some weight.
[277:01.53]Say hello, Aito.
[277:06.49]He needs to lose at least a pound or two.
[277:09.54]He's very chunky.
[277:11.32]But he has lost one pound.
[277:13.28]He has.
[277:13.60]He's kind of a beanbag chair.
[277:22.16]He's huge.
[277:22.82]He's not huge.
[277:24.22]He's not huge.
[277:26.97]He's kind of a beanbag chair, but he's not huge.
[277:31.31]Okay, come here.
[277:34.65]You want this?
[277:36.35]Oh my god.
[277:37.87]I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[277:44.70]Thanks for watching.
[277:45.90]See you later.
[277:47.18]Good night.
[277:56.72]It's a cookie.
[277:58.67]It's one little milk bone.
[278:02.77]Oh, okay.
[278:04.07]He got a little heavy, but I've been actively making sure he loses weight.
[278:09.23]He's lost like a pound.
[278:10.55]He's lost like 1.2 pounds in the last month.
[278:14.53]I'm trying to get him down like a pound a month, half a pound a month or so slowly.
[278:24.34]He would be at ideal weight if he lost, like, one or two more pounds.
[278:28.03]He'd be fine.
[278:31.01]His ideal weight is, like, 24 to, like, 25.
[278:34.21]Somewhere between, like, yeah.
[278:37.09]Like, 24 to 25 is his ideal weight.
[278:39.65]Remember, he's not 100% dachshund.
[278:42.35]He's a lot bigger than a typical dachshund.
[278:47.17]But, goodnight.
[278:47.61]See you guys Saturday, 4pm Pacific.
[278:50.95]Take care of yourselves.
[278:51.52]Thanks for staying up late.
[278:55.32]I really hope tomorrow I don't just wake up and go, oh, no, never mind.
[278:58.32]It's going to be a stream today at 9.30 at night.
[279:01.08]I'm going to try to hold myself to this schedule because I feel like I'm all over the place lately.
[279:07.78]Good night.
[279:08.12]Goodbye.
[279:08.44]See you later.
[279:43.58]you
