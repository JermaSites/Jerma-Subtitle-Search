[00:00.07]Well, I reckon you can go down that road down there.
[00:03.62]Oh, so you two think graffiti's funny, huh?
[00:06.44]Huh, both of yous?
[00:07.10]Why don't you explain yourself?
[00:08.78]Don't look at him!
[00:09.48]Look at me!
[00:09.92]Don't look at him!
[00:10.89]Look at me!
[00:11.85]Explain yourself to me, not him.
[00:13.61]They make these street signs so stupid, I... What...
[00:16.99]Which way's 42nd Street?
[00:18.97]I seem to have misplaced my shoes.
[00:21.59]Morning commute watch on the threes, guys.
[00:23.62]I-95 is going to be backed up all the way until New Jersey, so if you want to pull back as far as you can... Tremble before the fallen scourge!
[00:33.72]Oh, no, I really don't want to get up right now.
[00:36.74]I ate way too many Dunkin' Donuts munchkins.
[00:40.45]Or you dropped your bagel on the floor.
[00:45.11]Why do they make you choose the diapers you put on?
[00:48.25]I don't get it.
[00:49.88]I just want to wear a normal-sized diaper.
[00:52.60]Will you just shut up and tell me how to get to 42nd Street?
[00:55.30]Hey, hey, hey, calm down, man.
[00:56.74]There's no reason for that.
[00:57.94]Hello, and welcome to another edition of Books of Our Time.
[01:02.06]My name is Theodore Dickinson, and today we're going to be looking at a very, very popular book, Lord of the Rings.
[01:09.41]Generals, continue the fight!
[01:13.09]We have it all figured out.
[01:15.33]Step one, we land the Exodar.
[01:18.63]Step three, we defeat Legion and go home.
[01:21.89]There is only one detail missing.
[01:26.67]Take care.
[01:27.33]Bye-bye.
[01:27.89]I love you.
[01:28.80]What the hell does that mean?
