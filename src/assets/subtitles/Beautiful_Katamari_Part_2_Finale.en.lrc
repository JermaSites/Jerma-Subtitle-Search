[00:02.62]Hi.
[00:04.76]Welcome to the stream.
[00:06.02]Hi everybody, welcome.
[00:13.80]It's me.
[00:18.56]I'm almost not late?
[00:21.44]I mean, I'm not late.
[00:23.04]How can you be almost not late?
[00:25.80]You're either late or you're not.
[00:30.18]So, we're gonna finish Katamari Beautiful after we finish the DLC.
[00:37.68]I think there's another one or two levels in the base game, and then there's, I think, six or seven DLC levels.
[00:42.30]We're gonna smoke them all.
[00:45.57]I'm anticipating that will take somewhere between two and four hours.
[00:54.37]Now, maybe it'll take a little shorter.
[00:56.07]I don't know.
[00:56.39]Maybe it'll take longer.
[00:57.11]I don't know.
[00:58.49]Regardless of how long this takes...
[01:01.96]If there's still some time, which there probably will be.
[01:04.92]Bumbo came out.
[01:05.88]I didn't even know that.
[01:09.57]The Legend of Bumbo released last week.
[01:12.23]I've kind of been waiting for it.
[01:16.93]It's The Binding of Isaac prequel.
[01:20.69]It's a weird match-three kind of card game.
[01:25.13]I don't know.
[01:25.59]Edmund McMillan just makes crazy shit, so I want to try it.
[01:31.22]It's addictive as fuck.
[01:32.46]Well, that's good to hear.
[01:36.30]So, we started Katamari last night.
[01:37.74]I want to finish it.
[01:38.26]I'm doing this thing where I start game, finish game, but it's been like two and a half hours, so start new game.
[01:49.47]The train just keeps moving, apparently.
[01:52.66]I also... I kind of, I don't know, I kind of like want to play the Star Wars game.
[01:59.54]I just keep seeing people talk about it.
[02:01.76]I've seen the lightsabers and the dodge rolling.
[02:03.68]I'm just like, I think I want to play that.
[02:12.77]He's a fake Star Wars fan.
[02:14.27]I own more Star Wars clothes than anybody.
[02:21.60]I mean, does that mean I'm a big Star Wars fan?
[02:23.40]Does it mean that I shop exclusively at Walmart?
[02:30.00]You're wearing an Aquaman shirt right now.
[02:31.69]I am not.
[02:36.23]Is it a decent game from what I hear?
[02:39.59]Yeah, and we never play brand new releases.
[02:43.71]Sometimes we do.
[02:47.35]When a AAA game releases, you 99% of the time don't see it on this channel.
[02:52.85]So... Yeah, the la- what?
[02:57.43]The Ape game.
[02:58.59]Yeah.
[03:00.89]Is that a AAA game?
[03:03.17]I don't think so.
[03:03.59]That's like a AA game.
[03:06.68]You literally only play Monkey-related games when they release.
[03:19.67]That's true.
[03:20.53]That is a true statement.
[03:22.82]But still.
[03:24.56]I'm talking non-ape related video games.
[03:28.96]We'll see how it goes today into the next week here.
[03:32.86]But... I don't know.
[03:34.66]I might play Bumbo and get addicted and I never play anything else.
[03:39.95]But... Let's finish Katamari.
[03:42.03]Okay.
[03:44.25]Beautiful Katamari.
[03:46.31]Already got it open and I'm already at the next level.
[03:53.51]I have no plan.
[03:55.44]We're kind of in a mystery world here.
[03:57.76]Well, not right now, because obviously I'm playing Katamari.
[04:01.72]This isn't Dead Rising.
[04:02.96]I beat Dead Rising.
[04:03.86]And Dead Rising 2.
[04:05.74]One go.
[04:07.04]One save file.
[04:08.00]Well, I mean, no restarts is what I meant to say.
[04:11.96]Yep, I did that.
[04:14.02]Somebody's gonna PogChamp and go, are you fucking serious?
[04:17.56]Yeah, add it to the fucking badge.
[04:19.14]Alright, this is called Schloss Kosmos.
[04:24.04]Roll up a powerful things to make a supergiant.
[04:27.18]This might be the last base game level.
[04:28.88]We'll find out.
[04:33.05]Welcome to the icon of the princedom, Schloss Kosmos.
[04:38.51]A grand space for an epic race to roll a supergiant.
[04:42.93]We want you to collect lots of powerful things.
[04:45.57]Sumo, Rikishi, wrestlers, elephants, and bulldozers.
[04:49.47]The Supergiant needs to have some stomping power.
[04:53.07]Anywho... Let's go.
[05:01.15]I wonder what song we're gonna get this time.
[05:05.48]I missed Big Bits.
[05:06.32]Big Bits... Did they... Yeah, they did.
[05:09.20]File Actor, it litched another 5,000 bits.
[05:17.46]That's so much money over the last few months, man.
[05:22.00]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[05:24.26]Just saying, Jeremy, the new Star Wars game is kind of like Star Wars Dark Souls.
[05:27.44]Best Star Wars game in a long time.
[05:31.29]I know.
[05:32.65]I know.
[05:33.29]I've heard very mixed things about it.
[05:35.89]I've heard it's a great game.
[05:37.91]I've heard it's too safe.
[05:39.69]I've heard it's too hard.
[05:40.85]I kind of just want to see for myself.
[05:53.45]You ready?
[05:57.75]I'm gonna die to lightsaber wheel.
[06:00.19]I gotta form my own opinion, asshole.
[06:02.70]Why'd you call me an asshole?
[06:04.40]Hold on, this thing has to be 10,000... That's a huge... This is absolutely the last base game level.
[06:11.16]I have 20 minutes to roll 10,000.
[06:12.83]Holy shit.
[06:20.40]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[06:21.08]I wanna make my, I just said that.
[06:22.46]I wanna make my own opinion on it.
[06:25.50]What is a review?
[06:26.72]What is like somebody telling you?
[06:28.12]You know what I mean?
[06:28.68]Like, I'm gonna make my own opinion.
[06:30.60]That's what I just told you.
[06:32.88]We gotta plug the black hole.
[06:35.82]We need this to be an unimaginable size.
[06:39.79]And all cosmos is home free.
[06:41.51]Otherwise, squishville.
[06:44.33]Wow, it's not easy being you, is it?
[06:47.09]Alright, let's go.
[06:50.49]This thing has to be 10,000 kilometers.
[06:55.07]Off to a terrible start.
[07:07.61]Pretty good song.
[07:08.33]Uh, little cars.
[07:14.34]I'm already one beater, so...
[07:17.50]How the hell am I gonna do this?
[07:20.27]It seems too big.
[07:22.79]Get all the chicken.
[07:32.51]Can I pick up people?
[07:34.99]You have 20 minutes.
[07:35.81]Yeah, that goes fast though.
[07:40.39]I mean, anybody that's been on this stream, I mean, time flies when you're having fun.
[07:43.09]20 minutes is like fucking 2 on this stream.
[07:44.96]We have just so much fun.
[08:01.96]See, it's already been 3 minutes, and it's felt like 30.
[08:03.40]See?
[08:10.06]They have so much fun here!
[08:18.27]That's gotta get big enough to get on the buildings, that's all I care about.
[08:26.45]Alright, I gotta get out of this place.
[08:28.05]Three meters of music can go up.
[08:30.20]Bikes will do it.
[08:30.68]Yep.
[08:31.82]Alright, let's go.
[08:36.54]I'm gonna go up this way.
[08:37.76]Wait, where was it?
[08:38.22]It's over here.
[08:42.93]This is the best game?
[08:44.63]Definitely.
[08:45.87]I agree, this is a great game.
[08:48.63]All the Katamari games are awesome.
[08:52.54]Is this the last Katamari game?
[08:55.79]Besides the reboot?
[09:03.41]No, what was the last one?
[09:05.67]There's another one on the PS3.
[09:11.93]So did they just kind of... I mean, I guess once you do this enough times, there's only so many times you can make this game before you're just like, yeah, we kind of did it all, huh?
[09:23.52]I would love to see... I know it's... What else would they do?
[09:25.87]I would love to see another Katamari.
[09:27.77]Like a current gen Katamari.
[09:29.15]I feel like you can make it bigger.
[09:31.51]The scope could be larger.
[09:33.45]Because that's what happens in a game like this.
[09:34.89]It's like, well, what do we do?
[09:35.79]Do we just keep the same game and just make it even bigger?
[09:46.27]Can I pick them up?
[09:46.99]Yep.
[09:47.13]Let's go down the road.
[09:55.46]Katamari with guns and crafting.
[10:00.16]Katamari with guns and crafting.
[10:14.32]What is it?
[10:15.44]It's 15 to get over the next hill, right?
[10:17.85]Might just go up there now.
[10:25.39]Might just do it now.
[10:36.48]That looks like a lot of time, but there's a prince right there.
[10:40.82]Who's this?
[10:41.28]Is it a horse?
[10:43.38]It's Kenta.
[10:47.69]Why aren't you eating your mash?
[10:49.01]What?
[10:49.11]Alright, let's get the centipede.
[10:53.43]Alright, turn it around.
[11:07.52]10,000.
[11:07.54]I'm only 15 meters.
[11:10.91]How's this gonna work?
[11:19.86]Need bigger stuff.
[11:23.20]Run over the trees.
[11:24.22]Run over the tank?
[11:25.32]Gonna pick up the tank.
[11:26.30]There we go.
[11:27.31]Tons of people.
[11:36.25]Go!
[11:37.63]Get over to that car park.
[11:42.71]Alright, and this whole city here.
[11:44.75]Yep, there you go.
[11:45.99]We've got everyone.
[11:49.04]That's what I'm trying to get around.
[11:58.40]Everyone always says... Dude, what if the Earth is where to end?
[12:01.66]What if we're gonna get hit by, like, an asteroid or something?
[12:04.75]That's, like, boring.
[12:08.13]Wouldn't be much prefer this.
[12:16.22]No.
[12:21.62]Why?
[12:28.59]What, you just want to get hit by an asteroid?
[12:38.22]What about don't get hit by them?
[12:39.50]What about nothing?
[12:41.60]Yeah, I'm saying in the event that there's, like, a catastrophic space, like, big bang type shit again.
[13:01.77]Yeah, if it had music, that's what I'm saying.
[13:03.69]If this music just blasted.
[13:14.46]Alright, I got 12 minutes, almost?
[13:15.98]This music would have to be playing, yeah.
[13:20.58]Alright, back to the other- yeah, I have to go earlier.
[13:25.22]Get the big ones!
[13:35.14]I can't- can I get the big building?
[13:40.27]with the tanks.
[13:41.31]Nope.
[13:45.51]Alright, head back over here.
[13:51.43]Gotta get to a hundred.
[13:52.27]Once you get to a hundred, that's when you can just start steamrolling every single thing.
[13:56.04]Head across.
[13:59.32]Let's get the ball.
[14:08.60]One, two, three, four.
[14:09.76]There it is.
[14:10.30]Alright, scoop him up.
[14:19.77]Sixty.
[14:20.35]You gotta be sixty feet.
[14:23.13]Almost all of it.
[14:28.37]Get it all.
[14:29.47]Take up the whole Earth.
[14:33.26]What?
[14:33.80]I still can't get it?
[14:35.39]This is the last level?
[14:36.29]This is the last base game level.
[14:38.11]There are seven DLC levels.
[14:42.05]We're gonna try them.
[14:43.50]We're gonna play them!
[14:44.22]We're gonna go in the water.
[14:51.92]Grab the big boat.
[14:52.70]Yes!
[14:52.86]Stop fucking stealing from me, you fucking motherfucker.
[15:04.57]I think it's island time.
[15:05.77]No, I need one more.
[15:18.12]Good stadium.
[15:20.40]There's another city over here that I didn't get.
[15:24.33]Oh, another prince.
[15:24.97]Macho.
[15:27.09]I got him.
[15:36.80]Get it.
[15:38.40]Oh, it's right there.
[15:39.30]Alright, go for the dinosaurs instead.
[15:44.35]Present!
[15:44.69]Ooh!
[15:46.03]What's the present?
[15:54.35]Yep, island time.
[15:55.23]Let's go.
[15:56.41]I got a lot of time.
[15:57.30]Let's go get all the monsters.
[16:08.29]One more growth increase and I should be able to pick up the actual island.
[16:13.44]Plenty of time, that's right.
[16:16.50]You get it.
[16:20.36]Faster than I can.
[16:25.35]Stadium!
[16:29.67]Was it 300?
[16:32.26]To get the next increase?
[16:39.89]Shit.
[16:40.13]Alright, back to the... turn around.
[16:42.35]This way.
[16:46.30]I jumped everything I wanted to just pick up.
[16:48.46]Dammit.
[16:53.66]See the bird!
[16:55.54]Awww, too small!
[17:01.03]Alright.
[17:02.87]300.
[17:02.89]Time to start moving.
[17:07.65]I can actually pick up the ground now.
[17:20.98]Momentum.
[17:21.58]Too much momentum.
[17:22.28]Too much momentum.
[17:22.90]Please wait.
[17:32.45]I don't even know what I just picked up.
[17:36.01]There's a whole other island over here that I haven't even been to.
[17:38.01]This is gonna give you a lot.
[17:39.13]Please don't tell me I can pick it all up.
[17:43.33]Some of it.
[17:47.49]500.
[17:48.69]I need to get to 10,000.
[17:52.13]I need to get to 10,000 kilometers.
[17:56.19]I'm not sure I'm saying that right.
[18:00.56]I can pick up all the pink.
[18:12.09]I'm stuck.
[18:13.57]Holy shit, look at that giant octopus.
[18:20.59]Alright, this way.
[18:24.27]Look at all these mushrooms.
[18:32.17]Forward!
[18:35.07]Picking up- look at these penguins.
[18:36.33]Picking up a whole fat penguin.
[18:37.77]I don't even know what I'm picking up.
[18:40.89]I think I got a present.
[18:43.17]Alright, yeah, I got a present.
[18:47.69]Alright, I can't- I don't want to lose this, because...
[18:54.26]Okay.
[18:56.70]This is when you get insane.
[18:57.68]This is so satisfying.
[19:01.85]What I just did right there was the equivalent of watching, like, ten self-cutting videos in a row.
[19:07.35]I feel great.
[19:08.99]Fuck.
[19:09.23]Alright, forget it.
[19:10.45]Just go.
[19:10.79]I have to move.
[19:17.15]Turn!
[19:18.05]Turn!
[19:18.73]It won't turn!
[19:21.59]I'm trying, it's too big!
[19:23.09]I don't even know what to say, there's too many islands.
[19:41.12]Is this what it looks like from space?
[19:56.34]Imagine this is what it actually looked like out of the window from the space station.
[20:06.10]Would you guys, like, if you were an astronaut, would you talk about this?
[20:08.75]Would you want to take a picture of this?
[20:09.75]I feel like the world's just better off not known.
[20:23.67]I don't even know if I'm picking anything up.
[20:32.71]Oh, get the whole city!
[20:35.11]Yeah!
[20:38.19]10,000?
[20:38.45]How the fuck am I gonna do that?
[20:49.42]Can't get the volcano.
[20:54.37]I don't think I can get the octopus either.
[20:57.05]Nope, not yet.
[21:09.36]What is he even left to pick up?
[21:15.90]Did I get him?
[21:24.05]I got him.
[21:29.51]Only two.
[21:30.17]Get the dragon.
[21:36.48]Got ya.
[21:41.93]Holy shit.
[21:43.21]Ah.
[21:44.55]Wait.
[21:47.85]Almost.
[21:48.19]This is Earth.
[21:56.05]Ohhhhhhhhhh.
[21:58.69]400.
[22:02.39]Well, this started to really, really pick up.
[22:12.34]I need to get to 10,000.
[22:19.78]Hurry!
[22:31.11]Cousin!
[22:33.85]Got him.
[22:36.02]It's Mag.
[22:46.08]I don't know if I'm going to do it.
[22:49.20]It's going to be close.
[22:50.87]Really close.
[22:51.59]I can pick up the land.
[22:59.65]I can kind of get it.
[23:05.65]Let's get all of Antarctica.
[23:22.54]Come on, I can't get- what is that, USA?
[23:24.12]I need more land mass.
[23:31.24]There we go, right here.
[23:40.22]Get it all!
[23:42.98]Quick!
[23:49.65]Nooo, 5,000.
[23:51.17]One minute!
[23:54.92]Come on!
[23:58.88]I'm not even close!
[24:00.00]Go!
[24:19.78]Six thousand!
[24:21.90]Get it all!
[24:24.78]Nooo!
[24:26.48]It's gonna be so close!
[24:29.58]Australia!
[24:30.14]I got it!
[24:33.17]What's left?
[24:37.05]This way!
[24:42.39]Ohhh!
[24:42.59]What's left?
[24:44.31]Nine thousand!
[24:45.81]I did it!
[24:53.26]We're finally in space.
[24:55.06]Somewhere out here is the yucky black hole.
[24:57.02]I have to plug the black hole.
[25:00.78]I don't think I won.
[25:03.38]How about a two minute bonus to level the field?
[25:06.46]I got nice... I got... This is perfect.
[25:12.30]Okay.
[25:13.74]Don't go near... Don't go near the black hole.
[25:16.92]It'll suck you in.
[25:18.62]Wait until the katamari is big enough to plug it.
[25:25.51]Where's the black hole?
[25:29.72]Oh my god.
[25:32.96]I'm getting all the planets.
[25:38.62]Pisces.
[25:40.52]Orion.
[25:41.01]There's the sun.
[25:44.43]I can't get the sun yet.
[25:47.19]What, what, what, what?
[25:48.45]Danger, danger, danger.
[25:50.37]Get away from there.
[25:51.19]I can't even see it.
[25:59.80]You're near the black hole.
[26:03.76]Run or I'll squish you.
[26:05.48]Where is it?
[26:06.92]Shoo from the black hole.
[26:07.88]I can't even see it!
[26:15.32]Wait, is that...?
[26:16.64]That's him!
[26:18.40]Oh, there it is!
[26:18.87]I see it!
[26:19.15]Okay, turn around.
[26:27.45]Give me that planet.
[26:27.95]Ouch.
[26:34.25]Approaching black hole.

[27:26.65]I didn't do it!
[27:31.45]Alright, very nice.
[27:32.35]Hmm, this cut-off area looks kinda big.
[27:35.81]But, why is it here?
[27:38.34]We did say it's to plug up the black hole.
[27:42.24]Then why is it still here?
[27:44.28]You wanna take it home?
[27:46.70]Oh, go on then.
[27:48.48]But wait!
[27:50.66]What about the black hole?
[27:51.78]It needs to be plugged up.
[27:53.82]Why don't you listen to us?
[27:54.92]You don't want to help?
[27:56.84]We have nothing to say.
[27:58.42]Too bad, Ben.
[28:00.20]Sorry.
[28:00.72]Shame.
[28:01.18]Resignation.
[28:02.82]Wrath.

[28:36.81]We can still do it.
[28:38.55]Omega lulled 20 plus minutes.
[28:42.81]It was fun, though.
[28:43.93]I'm just gonna be faster.
[28:46.05]Okay, I get two extra minutes.
[28:47.05]Here we go.
[28:47.41]That was a warm-up round.
[28:49.95]Let's do it.
[28:55.74]Bad RNG.
[28:56.48]Bad spot.
[29:08.42]Bad spot.
[29:09.14]This is bad RNG.
[29:23.29]Sorry, I'll make it work Can't get people yet Bad RNG Bad RNG It's okay
[29:55.81]Why is this whole town on fire?
[30:04.22]The second I get to three, we're turning that corner.
[30:16.42]This might be salvageable if I get up there quick.
[30:27.65]Damn it, come on, I'm almost there.
[30:37.20]Oh, that's a shit start.
[30:38.62]That's kind of a shit start for me.

[30:43.76]I have to make this up now.
[30:59.49]Still possible.
[31:06.56]Oh, that's a shit start.
[31:15.85]Should I restart?
[31:16.71]Mmm.
[31:30.53]Oh.
[31:34.11]If I can get to the next phase really quickly, then I don't have to restart it.
[31:39.85]That elephant fucking RNG'd me.
[31:53.70]That's a lot of time that I just made up.
[32:04.22]Down here?
[32:05.64]Decent!
[32:14.78]Okay, decent!
[32:42.86]Alright, come back!
[32:54.24]Don't lollygag, I'm not... Although, I will admit, I did look over at the copypasta, and I read it.
[33:01.91]That was my mistake.
[33:13.71]Need those little houses.
[33:18.61]Alright, looking good.
[33:24.18]It's key for Augmentum.
[33:26.22]This is the one I want to be in.

[34:19.10]There's no way.
[34:20.68]I can't.
[34:22.56]How do you expect me to do that?
[34:27.75]Everyone says, don't put it on slow mode.
[34:29.87]But why is R09K on?
[34:31.13]I got your answer.
[34:33.97]It's in front of you.
[34:46.58]12 minutes.
[34:47.20]Is this enough time?
[34:53.46]I blew it.
[34:53.92]I blew it.
[34:54.40]That's a reset right there.
[34:55.48]I blew it.
[35:09.93]Oh, I didn't want to do a jump.
[35:18.25]How's my pace from last time?
[35:20.45]Worse?
[35:31.86]Is it worse?
[35:32.26]I can't tell.
[35:35.76]It's atrocious.
[35:46.04]My present, though.
[35:59.19]Your chat is worse than ever.
[36:02.25]Fuck.
[36:03.95]Alright, just wait a minute.
[36:05.55]Give me a minute.

[37:57.91]Didn't want to go over that!
[37:59.69]Wasting time!
[38:07.23]I mean, it was really cool, but what a waste of time that was.
[38:11.59]Go forward!
[38:17.69]Forward!
[38:18.09]Forward!
[38:18.63]Hold it!
[38:27.81]You have to relax Melvin.
[38:28.69]He's not relaxing.

[38:44.39]There we go.
[38:45.13]Alright.
[38:46.02]Almost at the point where I'm gonna get like five times my size.
[38:50.20]Let's get this entire island.
[38:52.14]Don't leave it.
[38:53.12]Get it all.

[39:55.28]Go faster, I'm trying!
[39:56.54]I need to get to, like, four.
[39:59.70]It's... gonna happen.
[40:07.10]Three.
[40:09.06]Alright, this is where it starts.
[40:13.64]Hurry up.
[40:17.45]It's all about the clouds here.
[40:18.79]And the... right here.
[40:31.52]Pick up all the sand.
[40:36.99]It was those that said it couldn't be done.
[40:49.51]It might not be done.
[40:50.75]I still have to do it.
[40:59.79]Trying to pick up as big of an island as I can.
[41:01.75]Alright, I know, I know, I got somebody.
[41:06.03]Good, good to know.
[41:10.80]Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger!
[41:12.76]Alright, can I pick up all the sand?
[41:20.89]I think so.
[41:21.23]I'm going to get this and I'm going to spin around.
[41:28.11]Come on.
[41:28.79]I don't want to do it again.

[41:34.31]Alright, I got- that was Europe, right?
[42:03.69]Good.
[42:05.39]I think I can pick this up.
[42:07.05]Nope.
[42:07.53]Go fast.
[42:20.12]Turn.
[42:20.44]Oh, it's so hard to turn if it's this big.
[42:33.75]Good.
[42:34.73]Not big enough for that.
[42:35.37]This is it.
[42:41.13]I think I have an extra 2 or 3 minutes than I did last time.
[42:53.20]That was so much faster.
[42:55.14]Alright, I got 6 minutes instead of 2.
[43:01.79]Do not go into the black hole.
[43:04.78]Two minute bonus.
[43:07.40]Don't go to the black hole, don't get sucked in.
[43:10.78]I got about six minutes.

[44:06.02]Danger, danger, danger.
[44:06.94]I know.
[44:07.16]Where is it?
[44:09.32]Oh, that's a black hole right there!
[44:12.20]Okay, don't freak out.
[44:14.56]I'm good.
[44:21.03]I'm sorry I just screamed so loud.
[44:31.99]I got time.
[44:32.87]I actually...
[44:35.31]Oh my god.
[44:35.97]Where is it?
[44:36.55]Oh my god.
[44:37.17]I know where it is.
[44:38.57]No!

[44:50.59]That is a full 60 minutes on this level.
[44:56.88]It just... I'm trying to get away from it.
[44:59.02]Oh.
[45:13.79]You can't even see the damn thing.
[45:24.98]I saw it first and I turned around and just... Alright, if I don't... I'm doing it this time.
[45:31.98]God damn it, another 20 fucking minutes.
[45:41.44]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[45:43.38]You have no idea.
[45:44.22]I'm probably purple right now.
[45:47.54]Red eye probably, yeah.
[45:55.32]I'm gonna go so slow when I get to the space part.
[45:57.83]I don't care.
[45:58.23]I'm gonna get there with 10 minutes remaining.
[46:00.79]Check it.
[46:26.26]Choke purple.
[46:27.84]Well, I'm not purple anymore.
[46:28.94]I can't... I was... Of course I can get sucked into the fucking black hole and end the 20 minute level.
[46:42.09]Come on.
[46:43.71]Next area, let's go.
[47:01.42]pretty clean actually just watch the ending on YouTube no that means I didn't do it that's that's the total just give up strategy
[47:29.94]At that point, why don't I just watch the whole- Why don't I just watch a playthrough of the game where the person doesn't talk?
[47:37.00]I'm having a good time.
[47:46.25]I'm gonna go so slow it's gonna be painful when I get to the space park.
[48:03.75]Straight down here.
[48:05.45]Shit, I can't get it.
[48:06.05]Hold on.
[48:06.55]I'm not actually hitting that.
[48:16.66]Good.
[48:17.54]Get the trees.
[48:18.12]Am I picking up the trees?
[48:20.96]Oh, I'm stunlocked.
[48:22.16]I'm about to smash the controller into the ground.
[48:24.75]Like, it's gonna explode into a million pieces.
[48:36.01]It's gonna be dust by the time I'm done with it.
[48:39.81]You know, sometimes people are just like, oh fuck, and they break their control.
[48:42.76]No, no, no, no, no.
[48:43.34]This thing is turning into dust.
[48:46.90]You're gonna have, you know, I'm gonna break this control so bad, you're gonna have to sweep it up.
[49:06.86]He's mad.
[49:07.62]Yeah, yes I am.
[49:15.42]Wouldn't pretend I'm not.
[49:17.68]I've walked into the black hole, so I had instant lose mechanics in video games.
[49:37.57]Am I right?
[49:38.48]Alright, almost 20.
[50:10.48]We need to pick up houses.
[50:11.94]Cards.
[50:13.06]Trees.
[50:13.80]Here come the houses.
[50:17.87]Not quite.
[50:18.33]30?
[50:18.35]40?
[50:18.83]We can get a little bit.
[50:34.33]It was a really good start, and then I started to process in my mind over and over again, losing to the black hole.
[50:41.16]And I might as well- you might as well just fuckin' shattered my glass screen.
[50:59.86]Alright, this is where I actually can do it.
[51:04.00]I need to go back to the original town.
[51:06.93]I actually know what this will do.
[51:28.85]Come on, big!
[51:29.35]Do it!
[51:29.55]So I can pick the rest of this up!
[51:31.59]Please!
[51:50.55]Keep going.
[52:16.86]Across the way.
[52:18.24]Give me all these trees.
[52:29.85]Getting back to the city.
[53:02.46]Yes, I know.
[53:03.14]Cool.
[53:07.88]Alright, we gotta get to the ocean now.
[53:30.85]I need 200.
[53:35.59]Hurry.
[53:35.97]I'm already behind.
[53:41.34]It's okay.
[53:42.68]I just gotta get there in like three or four minutes because I get five.
[53:45.78]Get the ice.
[54:03.48]Turn!
[54:09.19]Listen to the lyrics.
[54:10.13]What are the lyrics?
[54:11.81]I think it clouds the snow.
[54:15.68]I figured it out.
[54:32.67]Do that tower.
[54:39.47]Eight minutes.
[54:43.69]I don't want to do this again.
[54:47.79]I really don't want to do this again.
[54:58.80]Get the big guy.
[55:06.02]No!
[55:06.70]Oh, it's so hard to turn it when it's this huge.
[55:09.54]I'm holding forward right now, do you understand?
[55:32.91]What am I running into?
[55:57.80]I think I might save some time here.
[55:59.04]Just don't go into the black hole.
[56:03.33]If I go into the black hole one more time, I'll eat a ghost pepperon spring.
[56:09.21]You know what I mean?
[56:09.74]Like, that's the kind of shit I need to make sure I don't do.
[56:25.99]Do you hear how many times I clicked both buttons at the same time?
[56:38.88]Wouldn't that destroy my stomach?
[56:51.06]Yeah, so I better not go in the black hole!
[57:07.77]He's gonna go in that hole.
[57:09.03]I'm not gonna go in that hole.
[57:12.85]I can assure you, I'm gonna do everything possible to not go in that black hole.
[57:16.47]I'm gonna be using the prince look camera.
[57:37.80]Okay.
[57:40.66]Give me your energy, guys.
[57:41.90]I need it.
[57:49.74]Give it.
[57:51.25]Yes, somebody just said duck.
[57:52.33]Give it to me.
[57:57.23]Put your hands in front of the screen and power up to me.
[57:59.95]Okay.
[58:18.21]I don't think enough people are doing it.
[58:22.41]I feel like shit.
[58:24.01]You doing it for somebody else?
[58:31.59]It's just like those Christian infomercials.
[58:33.97]Put your hand on the screen.
[58:37.25]After drinking your miracle spring water.
[58:42.08]Little stuff.
[59:06.79]Here we go.
[59:07.17]This is where I want to be, right here.
[59:13.23]Get all the little dollops.
[59:34.22]Here we go, mountains.

[59:57.29]And don't go into the black hole.
[60:06.20]no no I can get all the sand
[60:36.63]Tarot is land!
[60:46.68]Sir, why are you not picking that up?
[60:56.43]I ain't picking it up!
[60:57.29]Why?
[61:03.59]I'm starting to freak out a little.
[61:06.96]Just calm down, I have time.
[61:13.24]Alright, I've almost got every land mass.
[61:16.96]There's one more over here.
[61:23.66]Alright, I have four and a half minutes.
[61:29.65]Where's the black hole?
[61:31.41]Where is it?
[61:34.02]Okay, where is it?
[61:57.58]Where's the black?
[61:58.54]What?!
[62:09.77]That was a wasted ta- I'm trying to see where it is!
[62:18.22]I'm so paranoid.
[62:20.82]I don't want to do the dash, but I feel like I need to.
[62:28.25]Where is it?
[62:31.09]I don't know where it is.
[62:36.63]You're near the black hole.
[62:37.95]Shoo from the black hole.
[62:43.82]What the fuck?
[62:45.64]You're getting close to the ghost pepper.
[62:48.24]I'm not turning around.
[63:13.27]I'm okay.
[63:25.94]Wait a minute.
[63:30.76]Where is it?
[63:38.80]Okay, I'm huge now.
[63:39.72]Now I can probably see it really clearly.
[63:46.30]If you would get the fuck off my screen!
[63:52.94]Get off of my screen!
[63:56.87]Why do you have to fill up the whole HUD when you have a question?
[64:33.02]I'm not going to make it!
[64:51.22]No!
[64:52.20]No!
[64:52.50]What do I need?
[64:58.46]A million?
[65:18.25]Get off the screen!
[65:30.16]Dude, there ain't nothing left to grab!
[65:37.60]Wait, go in!
[65:39.12]Go in, go in, go in!
[65:40.94]Where is it?
[65:42.20]Where's the lego?
[65:42.64]You told me 1 million!
[65:44.34]You told me 1 million!
[65:47.80]You said 1 million!
[65:50.32]Who said it?
[65:51.60]Who said 1 million?
[65:53.38]Oh, I'm gonna turn to dust!
[65:57.42]Who said 1 million?
[65:59.32]Somebody, you guys made me think it was 1 fucking million.
[66:04.81]No.
[66:12.01]Yes, they did.
[66:12.67]Why would I say 500 million?
[66:15.53]No, it was one super million.
[66:18.04]Oh no.
[66:26.06]Okay, I was like 400... Wasn't I already 500 fucking million?
[66:30.02]What was I... What was I two times ago?
[66:35.25]What was I two times ago?
[66:41.27]You were 300 last time.
[66:47.83]I want to go into the logs and see how many people said a million.
[66:51.57]A super million.
[66:52.49]Oh my god.
[66:53.67]I can't believe it.
[66:55.31]Wasn't it?
[66:55.61]No, I was like 600.
[66:56.30]I was like over 500 or 600.
[66:59.82]Oh, fuck.
[67:00.94]No, because I didn't go into the hole the first time.
[67:04.46]I was like 600 million the first time, but I ran out of time because I didn't know how long.
[67:09.04]I was 700 million.
[67:11.78]Oh my fucking god.
[67:15.06]And then some- some- this one person, I look over and it's, dude, you gotta be one million, like, oh, mega LOL.
[67:21.82]This guy's streamer sucks, he's gotta be a million.
[67:26.80]God damn it.
[67:30.80]And then I just turned back over here, it was, like, focusing, so I was trying to get to a- a one, like, teramillion.
[67:38.82]Oh, man.
[67:47.85]I can't believe it.
[67:49.29]I can't believe it.
[67:50.97]But I didn't know.
[67:52.07]I didn't know.
[67:53.41]Not again.
[67:56.23]Can I change the music?
[68:00.34]Is there like a music change?
[68:01.82]500 fucking million.
[68:11.58]Ungoddamn believable.
[68:13.64]I can't believe it.
[68:21.90]If only I had looked over at chat after getting to 500 million.
[68:25.93]I wasn't looking.
[68:26.51]I was just trying to focus and not go into the black hole.
[68:31.81]You guys were probably spamming.
[68:34.23]Go in and shit.
[68:35.05]And I look over at like 780 million.
[68:41.68]I didn't look at chat one fucking time.
[68:49.07]I trusted that one guy that said a million, because that seems such a perfect number to do.
[69:16.14]I hope you're enjoying this.
[69:19.59]I am.
[69:20.97]Except for when I don't do the fucking...
[69:32.15]This is actually going to be the last time.
[69:34.67]Don't watch me get sucked up by the black hole.
[69:36.55]Do not think negative thoughts like that, Jeremy.
[69:41.99]That's negativity.
[69:42.97]I'm not having that.
[69:44.47]No, I'm not going to get sucked up by the black hole.
[69:46.37]And I'm not going to like... Pret, pret!
[69:49.07]When he comes on.
[69:49.81]Yes, I am.
[69:59.00]We wasted our energy.
[69:59.86]You gave me lots of platoons.
[70:01.08]I got them 780 million.
[70:13.54]Why wouldn't he tell me how much it was to plug it?
[70:17.76]He just says, here's extra time.
[70:19.20]Plug that hole, but don't go near it.
[70:21.76]Stay away from it.
[70:22.96]But plug it, but don't go near it.
[70:31.23]Just tell me what you want.
[70:32.17]I'm good at delivering if you tell me what you need.
[70:45.79]I'm happy with this so far.
[70:46.63]Except for that big gaff.
[71:00.23]Return our energy?
[71:01.13]No, it's mine.
[71:03.61]There's no energy refund.
[71:14.80]Come on, get over there.
[71:15.52]Plus, you've already expelled the energy.
[71:22.73]You want your energy back?
[71:25.13]Sure.
[71:26.21]Go eat a banana.
[71:28.80]Go eat a salad.
[71:30.66]Go have a hamburger.
[71:39.90]Alright, I get him.
[71:41.40]Wasting time.
[71:51.71]The one guy always prevails.
[71:54.60]The power.
[71:55.98]The power in the one guy is so strong.
[71:59.28]The next time you don't think you have any power in the world, just come to Jerma985.
[72:13.97]You will change the course of whatever I'm doing.
[72:22.05]As long as you're the only one.
[72:23.49]Alright, I think I can get this out, yeah.
[72:40.83]That was... sick.
[72:42.09]Stop.
[72:48.03]Stop.
[72:59.78]I can't get over it.
[73:00.51]I can't get over that I've beat it.
[73:02.51]That was dumb.
[73:03.19]Now I have to do it again.
[73:07.37]Don't worry, this will be the last time.
[73:21.18]Anytime.
[73:31.16]shroom island right through and then bang around turn around after this speed
[74:04.98]Back to the other island.
[74:15.12]Here.
[74:18.80]Nope.
[74:21.02]Other island.
[74:23.05]Soon.
[74:49.05]What?
[74:49.21]They can run?
[74:51.26]Why can the pyramids run?
[75:13.80]Now knowing it's only 500, I don't have to spend much time building that ship.
[75:20.67]Man, the pyramids flew away.
[75:24.79]I know what I saw.
[75:26.59]You can't tell me that I didn't see it.
[75:43.71]Ghost pepper waiting room.
[75:44.99]You know, that was if I got sucked into the black hole prematurely.
[75:51.77]Not if I lost.
[75:54.21]Oh, go around him.
[76:00.06]He's that big.
[76:17.90]This is such a sloppy pace, but I don't even care.
[76:20.89]I just need to beat it.
[76:30.89]Why would it even go that way?
[76:32.62]It's a roll that goes straight, and I just shot to the left.
[76:50.98]This is supposed to be relaxing.
[76:52.04]Get out of the way!
[76:56.06]I know it was.
[76:58.47]It's never relaxing though, is it?
[77:07.67]Go in the hole now.
[77:08.45]I would love to move.
[77:09.97]It would be great to actually move the character.
[77:13.68]Oh, I'm so gone.
[77:23.21]300 to plug the hole.
[77:24.05]It is not 300.
[77:24.89]Okay.
[77:25.07]Please get off the screen.
[77:35.52]I know it's, like, funny and intentional that he takes up the whole fucking screen, but, like, is it funny when he- is it that funny anymore?
[77:42.62]No.
[77:49.94]It's not funny anymore.
[77:57.61]You have to disable HUD.
[78:06.22]There is no disabled HUD.
[78:07.58]This game's from like 2005.
[78:08.52]No, I'm not molting yet.
[78:21.05]No, not yet.
[78:24.51]My dead skin's not dropping off at the moment.
[78:26.27]Good pick up.
[78:50.33]I'm just gonna buy, like, a skin suit.
[78:53.67]One of those, like, spandex suits that I had during a stream one time and I was getting really annoyed.
[78:56.89]I'm gonna get it.
[78:57.35]I'm just gonna fucking peel it off and bolt off straight away.
[79:13.02]And it's gonna take, like, six to seven weeks.
[79:19.98]I'm gonna get out behind this dude.
[79:42.03]He's so behind.
[79:59.38]A morph suit.
[80:00.14]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[80:01.12]Like a spandex, like, one of those spandex, like, super fan suits.
[80:06.27]What the hell do you think I'm talking about?
[80:21.18]No, not a suit made out of skin.
[80:26.61]No, a morph suit.
[80:28.87]Did I get it?
[80:39.18]I got the Vulcan.
[80:39.80]That means it's time to win.
[80:47.84]Okay 5 minutes
[81:21.68]End of the stream, boys?
[81:24.02]Huh?
[81:26.04]We just started, like an- oh my god, it's- nevermind.
[81:29.00]It's been- how long has it been?
[81:30.38]It's been an hour and a half, holy shit.
[81:33.61]I can't believe it's been that long.
[81:38.35]Are you sure it hasn't been eight and a half minutes?
[81:52.49]This is my fourth attempt?
[82:13.39]Is it?
[82:13.83]No, it's not.
[82:15.17]This is my... third attempt?
[82:17.92]How many attempts is this?
[82:20.44]Only three.
[82:27.76]Right?
[82:28.54]This is not the fourth attempt.
[82:31.30]This is the third attempt.
[82:37.69]It can't be fourth.
[82:39.91]Oh, no, that makes total sense.
[82:41.49]It's an hour and twenty minutes for the scream.
[82:50.48]Welcome to hell.
[82:57.43]Okay, please.
[83:00.07]I just need 500,000.
[83:00.79]Forward.
[83:08.42]Forward, forward, forward, forward!
[83:13.22]Get something!
[83:13.93]Anything!
[83:37.49]God, I'm gonna need those two minutes.
[83:50.76]Boop!
[83:51.72]I'm moving!
[83:52.66]Move, oh my god!
[83:53.66]Okay. 500,000.
[84:09.19]Don't fly in 500,000, let's go.
[84:10.75]100,000.
[84:10.77]Wait, where is it?
[84:28.80]Anybody know where it is?
[84:31.60]Where is it?
[84:40.27]Alright, slow down, I got plenty of time, slow down.
[84:56.19]More than halfway there.
[84:58.37]Am I getting too close?
[85:12.94]Where is it?
[85:13.46]Where is it?
[85:49.93]That's... I'm trying... You can't get away.
[85:54.95]What do you want to do?
[85:55.79]What do you want me to do?
[85:58.81]Like, what the hell?
[86:02.34]What do you want me to do?
[86:03.54]Oh, it's just like a... That's so stupid.
[86:13.23]You gotta be kidding me.
[86:25.44]Now the go- Oh my god, I can't fucking believe we're doing this again.
[86:30.16]Because of the last 30 seconds of this 20 minute level.
[86:36.16]Why?
[86:36.60]Why?
[86:37.48]Why?
[86:37.98]Why?
[86:38.38]Why?
[86:55.19]I tried.
[86:55.89]I didn't know where it was.
[86:57.77]When I found out, I switched.
[86:59.18]Spin.
[86:59.54]Get away.
[86:59.88]No.
[87:01.00]I tried.
[87:01.78]I really did.
[87:03.52]Welcome to hell.
[87:05.46]I'm not watching a video.
[87:06.93]Oh my god.
[87:07.85]I can't believe it.
[87:24.06]The only ghost pepper was if I got sucked in that last round, and I didn't.
[87:28.44]I ran out of time.
[87:33.24]Dude.
[87:33.80]Alright, dude.
[87:35.84]Let's be real.
[87:37.45]Fuck that.
[87:38.03]You know what I mean?
[87:38.75]Like, that's all I gotta say.
[87:39.81]Let's be real.
[87:40.43]Get the fuck out of here with that.
[87:43.31]You know what I'm saying?
[87:44.01]Like, that last ten seconds.
[87:45.45]You know what I'm saying?
[87:46.37]Like, fuck that.
[87:47.25]That's all I have to say.
[87:48.57]That's all I have to say.
[87:55.81]Not the ghost pepper.
[87:56.97]I'm talking about, like, this ending to this level.
[87:59.59]Fuck that.
[88:00.67]Like, get back.
[88:01.73]Come on.
[88:02.47]That's all I got to say.
[88:03.29]I've got nothing else to say about that one.
[88:13.28]I can't... Guys, if I eat a ghost pepper, I will die.
[88:16.24]I can't eat one.
[88:22.96]Fucking black hole.
[88:27.92]Danger, black hole.
[88:34.02]Pop-up windows.
[88:34.76]1998 internet pop-up window.
[88:41.89]Why'd you go over there?
[88:42.83]Why'd you do that?
[88:43.57]Why'd you do that?
[88:44.27]Why'd you go over there?
[89:01.50]Little did I think, I had no idea that Beautiful Katamari's final level was gonna be harder for me than all of Dead Rising 2.
[89:17.59]This can't be.
[89:19.07]It can't be.
[89:20.59]I can't.
[89:21.23]This can't be.
[89:33.01]I can't be.
[89:33.79]I can't be.
[89:34.77]I'm doing this again.
[89:35.81]I can't stop.
[89:38.01]It's only been like an hour and a half.
[89:39.55]We're just starting.
[89:41.13]We're just hanging out here.
[89:44.11]But, you know what I mean?
[89:44.87]Like, fuck that.
[89:52.53]I think I should stand still.
[89:54.07]I can't stand still.
[89:58.73]Eat the pepper.
[89:59.49]I'm not eating a ghost pepper on stream.
[90:01.60]I lied.
[90:03.10]Alright, make a new username.
[90:05.20]In fact, make 20 of them for all I care.
[90:10.76]I'm a selective truth teller.
[90:14.20]Sometimes I say things and they're real.
[90:15.91]Sometimes I say things and I'm a selective truth teller.
[90:28.34]Oh, so a liar.
[90:29.30]I'm not a liar.
[90:32.10]I just selectively tell the truth sometimes.
[90:43.17]Come on.
[90:43.77]Give me a break.
[90:45.01]Give me a break.
[90:45.53]I can't eat a ghost pepper.
[90:46.63]I already told you.
[90:47.41]I said that.
[90:47.85]Wouldn't it be... You know what?
[90:49.31]I'm protected.
[90:50.93]If you clip it, I say specifically.
[90:53.25]Wouldn't it be funny if... Imagine if...
[90:57.64]Imagine now if... These are hypotheticals, they're not real.
[91:04.26]I specifically said... Wouldn't it be funny if... Imagine if... Now he's lying about the lie.
[91:35.45]I can't eat a ghost pepper, I'll die.
[91:41.23]I'll go to the doctor after eating it, and my GI doctor will say, specifically, why did you eat something that can potentially kill you?
[91:51.34]Well, you see, doctor, I lied to my livestream about eating a ghost pepper.
[91:59.21]And then I was pressured to eat it because I told everybody I was going to eat it.
[92:04.16]Because I was molting during Katamari, the final level.
[92:07.84]I got sucked into the black hole.
[92:10.10]And then he's going to drop his fucking datasheet.
[92:11.94]He's going to be like, fuck that level.
[92:13.98]I'm going to be like, what are you talking about?
[92:17.65]Fuck that level.
[92:18.25]He's going to be like, yeah, I remember that level.
[92:21.74]I mean, like, what is with developers putting in instant-lose scenarios in 20, 30-plus levels?
[92:27.10]30-plus-minute levels.
[92:28.65]And I'm gonna be like, what?
[92:29.49]That's what I thought.
[92:31.77]I'm like, what is that?
[92:33.27]I remember that level, and it took me, like, ten tries.
[92:35.57]And I'm like, fuck, man, I, like, completely agree.
[92:43.14]Oh, by the way, because you ate the ghost pepper, you're dead in three days.
[92:50.18]Oh.
[92:57.46]And then he's gonna walk out of the room.
[92:59.90]And under his lab coat, I'm gonna see.
[93:02.55]He's gonna have molting skin.
[93:04.23]Like, there's gonna be, like, a big cape of molted skin.
[93:07.39]Like, he's already done this shit.
[93:08.99]He did it, like, two weeks ago.
[93:26.09]This might be the best run yet.
[93:27.01]Yeah, and then I get up and shake his hand, and I'm like, oh yeah, good to see you, good to see you!
[93:36.70]Yeah, he takes a step out, I take a step out, and I step on his, like, wedding gown skin.
[93:42.16]And he flies forward, and I fly forward, and it's wicked embarrassing.
[94:09.10]What?
[94:11.34]Am I allowed to vent?
[94:14.47]I'm just trying... I'm venting.
[94:17.61]This is the best run I've had since starting my career.
[94:24.01]On Katamari.
[94:34.25]He's distracting us from the ghost pepper.
[94:38.92]Alright, can I eat a... Can I eat a tomato that a ghost prepares for me?
[94:47.74]Can I have a bell pepper that a ghost makes?
[94:51.78]I mean, that technically would be a ghost pepper, right?
[95:09.47]No, who cares about eating anything on stream?
[95:15.30]I hate eating on stream.
[95:20.31]I'm stuck.
[95:27.14]Show feet.
[95:27.88]Ban that person.
[95:38.21]What about the McChicken review?
[95:39.43]Yeah, I like turned the camera off ten times.
[95:47.40]Eight minutes.
[96:06.98]Show your multi-spin.
[96:08.60]No, I'm not multi.
[96:09.48]I'm multi.
[96:11.48]I don't even know what to do.
[96:25.63]Stop being so weird.
[96:42.76]I'll make sure to monologue that into the bathroom mirror so that it's nice.
[96:47.24]Why are we emote only?
[96:48.08]What happened?
[96:51.12]I'm the fucked up one.
[96:52.18]Why did we go to emote only?
[96:56.97]I'm the problem here.
[96:58.65]It's me.
[96:59.53]I'm the problem.
[97:03.77]It's my... I'm the problem.
[97:09.60]Oh, it's because people can't- Oh, I see.
[97:11.20]I get it.
[97:11.80]Now I know why.
[97:12.91]I get it.
[97:27.51]But I'll be fair to chat, though.
[97:29.97]I- You can't... I can't just, like, drop a nuke.
[97:34.28]And then just run into a bunker and be like...
[97:38.53]People are going to react to that.
[97:47.09]I essentially was like, oh hey guys, good luck!
[97:49.22]And I press the button.
[97:52.32]And then I just jump into a bunker.
[98:10.12]What about the time?
[98:11.28]Oh, fuck, right.
[98:16.47]Welcome to the one level in Katamari's stream.
[98:22.89]How long did The Simpsons hit and run final level take me?
[98:25.33]Two hours?
[98:26.53]I can't pass that record.
[98:33.51]That final level was built two hours.
[98:38.91]We're getting close.
[98:39.91]I don't want to break that record.
[98:53.54]It's tending to be bad.
[98:54.90]God damn it.
[99:03.49]I can't click that right now.
[99:04.93]I'm in the middle of a game.
[99:06.03]Okay, I can pause.
[99:11.41]Okay, I saw a clip.
[99:12.94]This clip's link, I thought, said sweatiest, ugliest Boston... No, it's... That's not what that is.
[99:21.58]Sweatiest, ugliest Boston streamer.
[99:24.00]I was like, what the fuck is this title?
[99:29.64]Yeah, okay, I know.
[99:30.36]It's the McChicken video.
[99:39.48]What is the actual title?
[99:41.05]Sweatiest Ugliest What?
[99:46.01]That's a weird title.
[99:54.85]No, that's not the one.
[99:57.70]For me, it's the McChicken.
[99:58.62]It's the best sandwich.
[100:00.70]I agree.
[100:01.08]Me too.
[100:05.64]No, the person that had the sweatiest, ugliest one.
[100:09.53]You know who you are.
[100:10.25]I wanna see it.
[100:14.54]The sweatiest, ugliest Boston streamer.
[100:16.83]That's real.
[100:18.55]Where did you get this?
[100:19.55]No, that's a fake.
[100:20.47]Don't click that.
[100:21.19]That's fake.
[100:22.89]That's fake.
[100:24.97]Where's the action?
[100:25.75]Okay, I'm done.
[100:26.63]For a second, I was like, you can do custom links that you can't.
[100:36.10]Somebody actually has it.
[100:37.22]It's like something ugliest bison.
[100:43.52]Most of the time.
[100:58.95]Sleepy, ugliest, bison, ginger power?
[101:08.68]What?
[101:21.57]That's the link!
[101:22.21]That's the one!
[101:32.67]Oh my god.
[101:34.41]You guys are fucking me up so bad.
[101:36.87]Okay, no more chat.
[101:39.01]I'm just gonna look straight ahead.
[101:40.55]It's gonna be hard for me, but I'm gonna look straight ahead.

[102:16.34]I'm gone.
[102:17.12]I'm actually gone right now.
[102:18.82]I thought it's been 10 minutes.
[102:20.22]It's been 2 hours.
[102:22.36]Relax.
[102:23.02]I got it.
[102:24.48]500 meters.
[102:25.18]500 million.
[102:26.14]Whatever the hell it is.
[102:26.93]I'm going to have time.
[102:27.67]I just have to get 500.
[102:29.87]I'm going to go very, very slow.
[102:31.39]But you can't go slow.
[102:32.59]You can't go fast enough away from the black hole.
[102:48.48]I'm gonna get two more minutes.
[102:49.72]That's enough to get five more minutes.
[102:52.28]Why you not moving?
[103:00.45]Pick up something.
[103:01.59]I almost took six, this is gonna grow again.
[103:11.80]No, over here.
[103:14.14]Come on, just pick up something, please.
[103:20.79]Yikes.
[103:23.57]Get it!
[103:38.95]Okay.
[103:40.43]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[103:42.03]Okay.

[103:55.81]No black hole.
[104:16.10]Just follow the stars.
[104:19.57]I'm sticking around Earth.
[104:26.25]Out of my way.
[104:28.87]Stay near Earth.
[104:32.40]It's going to take the whole three minutes, but I'm going to do it.
[104:48.39]That's a great way to lose.
[104:52.20]A lot of shit over here.
[105:00.08]Where's our... there it is.

[106:25.00]Where is it?
[106:25.50]I have a minute to find him.
[106:38.66]Don't need to do it yet.
[107:17.40]Here you go.
[107:42.11]Alright.
[107:44.94]Hey, I just beat the game.
[107:45.82]On to the DLC.

[115:47.79]Oh my god.
[115:48.87]From Vilemi.
[115:51.67]Congrats on beating that level, Jerma.
[115:53.05]Now play the Ayayayaya level again, or else.
[115:57.72]I'm sure you heard the song again, but thanks for the 5,000.
[116:00.00]Another insane amount of money.
[116:03.66]Am I supposed to be saving everybody?
[116:05.40]I don't... Okay, I haven't been paying that much attention.
[116:07.74]Am I killing them and then picking up their angels?
[116:09.56]Oh, I'm not supposed to be avoiding these either.
[116:16.95]I'm supposed to be picking them up.
[116:19.85]I'm treating it like it's an actual bullet hell game.
[116:26.92]Insanity, guys.
[116:27.76]The frillity.
[116:29.18]Ten sucks.
[116:29.86]Ten more.
[116:31.58]On top of it.
[116:33.34]This is insane.
[116:37.64]Get cat.
[116:38.29]I can't.
[116:46.95]I feel like I'd be pretty good at some of these games.
[116:49.79]I really do.
[116:52.91]Somebody made my, uh, oops.
[116:55.61]Somebody made, uh, I remember a while ago, somebody made my, like, streamer, like, um, D&D kind of card.
[117:04.33]And I had almost, I had a 9.2 in Twitch reflexes.
[117:10.78]I have 4 in problem solving.
[117:15.08]But, I mean, I think my Twitch card was pretty good.
[117:24.95]I did it.
[117:31.01]Finally, we have peace and harmony in the cosmos.
[117:35.03]It's been a while.
[117:35.61]We feel sort of funny.
[117:38.35]Plus 10 bolting.
[117:40.73]You've all done such a fab work.
[117:42.97]We're so proud of how much you've grown.
[117:44.55]Hey, thanks, King.
[117:47.09]That was, like, powerful.
[117:48.51]Better than Fashion Week.
[117:50.78]That's pushing.
[117:52.08]By the way, how was that freakish little game?
[117:56.61]It's in Katamari Memorial if you ever need it.
[118:00.33]Fab.
[118:01.99]All requests completed.
[118:02.97]Great work, Banban.
[118:04.39]Anyhow, wiped screen.
[118:05.43]We forgot something major.
[118:07.40]You know about Uranus, one of our favorite stars.
[118:10.64]It hasn't been remade yet.
[118:11.78]We left it off the list.
[118:13.40]Our bad.
[118:13.76]We know.
[118:14.04]We'll fix it through Banban.
[118:16.55]You remake Uranus, and we'll totally cooperate.
[118:19.41]We even built a special house on the big tripper.
[118:22.34]Chateau Notre-Dessire.
[118:24.12]So come on, get running.
[118:26.30]Not this one.
[118:27.30]Oh, I missed his birth.
[118:30.12]Alright, I need to go to my accessory shop.
[118:37.65]So here's the DLC levels, but we're not going to do them yet.
[118:42.77]I want to go to my accessory shop.
[118:45.54]Why am I pronouncing it like that?
[118:46.72]I don't know.
[118:50.28]Should I not be pronouncing it like that?
[118:51.54]Alright, what do we got?
[118:55.20]Big giraffe head.
[118:56.48]Yeah.
[118:58.26]Alright, I know.
[118:58.98]Is there somebody yellow?
[119:00.36]You.
[119:02.88]Yeah, I want to be the giraffe.
[119:04.24]Wait, that's more of a giraffe, isn't it?
[119:07.60]No, this is correct.
[119:14.38]Okay.
[119:15.74]Uh, that's fine.
[119:19.14]What is this?
[119:20.64]Okay.
[119:22.85]Oh, it's good.
[119:29.95]There's a run button.
[119:31.29]Whoops.
[119:32.17]Alright.
[119:32.53]There's the memorial.
[119:33.27]What's the... A new island, right?
[119:39.45]I love that noise.
[119:40.07]I love the running sound.
[119:43.83]Oh, there we go.
[119:48.92]Where's- where's Banban?
[119:50.74]Where's Banban?
[119:51.22]Get over here.
[120:16.09]No, I want to dance too.
[120:28.46]I like the robot one.
[120:32.62]I kind of want to play with the watchdog's print.
[120:35.69]The buttons.
[120:41.27]The buttons.
[120:49.79]There it is.
[120:51.83]Complete the King's request to make Uranus.
[120:57.59]Colored lights?
[120:59.64]I don't know.
[121:03.90]Is the green screen stream gonna be soon?
[121:05.26]Yeah, probably in a couple weeks.
[121:07.66]I have to make the channel, though, first.
[121:11.58]A royal roll here means the dawn of a new Uranus.
[121:14.78]Good.
[121:15.63]Hmm, you're in a good mood.
[121:22.05]Anywho, this one's for us.
[121:22.99]Okay.
[121:26.51]So, a super special rule.
[121:27.61]Whatever we ask, you roll.
[121:29.52]Like, stylish, then cute, then gadgets, and so on.

[122:18.54]Now here's the scoop on the special rule.
[122:21.84]This is one for us, a starry tribute.
[122:25.16]Yes, it's Uranus.
[122:26.56]Does that make you Cronus?
[122:28.29]Don't get any ideas.
[122:30.79]We'll be your Katamari, a blast from the past.
[122:33.53]See, it's our inner child.
[122:34.93]We're so cute.
[122:37.77]Roll everything up so our boyhood self grows.
[122:40.93]What is the king?
[122:42.61]There's no time limit.
[122:44.70]And oh, you have to find whatever we tell you.
[122:47.48]Like food or drinks or creatures or gadgets.
[122:50.66]We want Uranus to have it all.
[122:52.92]I wishes your command like roll up chick stuff.
[122:56.98]Quite a challenge, but can you handle it?
[122:58.86]And you get to watch the evolution of us.
[123:02.68]By the way, we only roll first class, no bumping.
[123:06.77]Strange, yes.
[123:08.05]You get to be the adult for once.
[123:13.80]Ciao, Nick.
[123:16.82]Ever think about style, fashion and such?
[123:20.76]We do.
[123:22.75]It's not just the vanity, it's because the cons of this song.
[123:28.41]Can use all the fun and beauty it can get.
[123:30.87]You know, we will vote the best dressed creature in the cosmos adapted from another source.
[123:36.44]We accept it on behalf of all cosmos classes.
[123:40.22]We kept the trophy.
[123:40.78]It was too shiny to share.
[123:42.07]I'm getting, like, tired here.
[123:43.93]My character is lying down.
[123:50.28]Shaped like a cake and, yeah.
[123:52.02]An abundance of accessories chosen personally.
[123:54.54]You know what our favorite accessory was?
[123:56.84]It was a sharko.
[123:58.08]Don't know those?
[123:59.10]It's a hat shaped like a shark and it roared.
[124:02.80]Fish don't roar, but it had to do.
[124:04.16]What's your point?
[124:05.75]If you stop quibbling, we may even get you one.

[126:51.93]Roll up.
[126:52.19]Cute.
[126:52.37]Get cute.
[126:52.73]Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute.
[126:58.86]Cookies?
[127:02.68]Are dice cute?
[127:06.44]Dice are cute.
[127:07.14]Rats are cute.
[127:14.07]Oh, here he is.
[127:16.23]Gabby J. Gabby J.
[127:29.06]Now what do you want?
[127:31.07]All we need out here in life... Cute things.
[127:35.29]I'm doing it.
[127:36.31]You got so many cute things.
[127:40.59]That's so fab.
[127:41.55]Gracious.
[127:41.99]You've earned yourself another story, I think.
[127:43.81]Oh, okay.
[127:46.68]Come to think of it, we don't remember having much fun as a child.
[127:49.70]Every day we studied strict royal education for a future king.
[127:52.64]Just between you and us, Papa was a... Skinnerian?
[127:59.41]Wish we'd played more.
[128:00.61]Frolicking in the fields.
[128:05.89]Playing ping pong.
[128:07.53]Cavorting in clouds.
[128:11.41]Dancing with... Das... Daisy Pood... Daisy Podadida... I don't...
[128:29.94]Alright, you gotta bring it from PhD to, like, 8th grade.
[128:33.44]That's the only way I'm gonna know what you're trying to tell me.
[128:47.45]Playtime.
[128:49.13]Can't get the mice?
[128:50.05]I need to be 20 centimeters to do that.
[128:58.93]This takes us back to a happy place.
[129:02.83]Oh, we needed out of life back then.
[129:04.27]We're playthings.
[129:06.41]You got so many of them.
[129:07.75]That's so fab.
[129:08.63]Gracious.
[129:09.77]You've earned yourself another story.
[129:14.92]We're kind of hungry.
[129:15.78]Roll us some food, yes?
[129:17.00]Maybe some ramen curry is nice, too.
[129:20.37]We are the foodie king.
[129:22.37]Arugula beats... I don't want to!
[129:26.21]Garlic and sapphires.
[129:27.41]We eat it all.
[129:29.17]That's how we got this amazing cosmic bod.
[129:32.48]Nick is trying.
[129:33.88]Yes, but far from buffness.
[129:36.95]Being picky, icky, carrots, liver, fishies.
[129:41.47]Try everything.
[129:42.27]Feed the body and brain.
[129:43.51]I feel like you wrote this as a copypasta in this chat.
[129:46.75]Food is an adventure.
[129:47.83]Exercising is a trip.
[129:49.43]But we confess we did have one food dislike.
[129:52.48]We used to hate cheese.
[129:53.66]It just smelled weird.
[129:55.22]Papa said it was rude, so we made ourselves eat it.
[129:58.48]Thanks to him, we have great teeth and bones.
[130:01.22]And we like cheese now.
[130:02.74]Humble.
[130:03.40]Fog.
[130:04.26]Yum.
[130:05.50]Dinner is served, Nick.
[130:06.95]Go roll up lots of food.
[130:08.49]How about ice cream sandwiches?
[130:19.96]Roll up rats and lots of food.
[130:24.32]Orange slices.
[130:30.07]How about bong water?
[130:38.68]You're gonna get sick, not me.
[130:44.08]Fuck, are the rats actual food?
[130:45.74]No, they're not.
[130:58.09]That felt good.
[131:00.10]Coffee creamer's not food?
[131:01.14]You sure?
[131:03.92]I mean, it's dairy.
[131:12.73]Got it.
[131:14.27]Ever think about style, fashion?
[131:15.71]Yes, I have.
[131:16.55]We do.
[131:17.15]It's not fun for me.
[131:20.65]Fashion, fashion, fashion.
[131:30.46]Best dressed.
[131:31.22]Why haven't I seen this cutscene?
[131:32.76]Yes, I've seen Sharknado, whatever he said.
[131:50.75]Let's go up.
[131:58.19]Money!
[131:58.47]Oh, there he is.
[132:02.58]He grew.
[132:03.94]Oh my goodness, what's going on?
[132:06.38]I'm all warmed up!
[132:07.38]Perfect!
[132:07.76]We want you to collect warm things now.
[132:09.72]An endurance challenge.
[132:10.86]No, we have our reasons.
[132:12.96]How did we end up doing a thing like that?
[132:30.18]This is the reason we ourselves are on a roll.
[132:49.02]But warm things will help us sweat out the fat.
[132:51.96]Yes.
[132:53.08]Then we can go back to our old, svelte selves.
[132:57.43]And go out with friends for ramen tomorrow night.
[133:02.01]Okay.
[133:02.81]Hot food.
[133:03.37]Those are matches.
[133:11.06]How is that not hot?
[133:18.35]You can't sweat out fat, only water.
[133:31.36]Is this the part where you press your glasses back up to your nose?
[133:36.58]It's a kid's cartoon.
[133:49.94]You can breathe out fat.
[133:52.20]Imagine.
[133:53.32]Not a whole lot of hot things.
[133:56.84]We want luxury.
[134:06.57]How many, how many do I have to do this for?
[134:12.75]Until he's grown?
[134:20.95]Bananas are luxury, aren't they?
[134:22.03]Air Mail.
[134:22.39]Ooh, I got a present.
[134:41.39]That box you rolled up was a present for us.
[134:43.92]We were wondering.
[134:45.10]How are you with cold?
[134:46.82]We adore the cold.
[134:47.82]I love the cold.
[134:49.42]Roll up cold things.
[134:50.80]Stop ignoring me.
[134:52.14]Roll up cold stuff.
[134:54.26]What?
[134:57.33]Really?
[134:57.67]We didn't know.
[134:58.65]So it was our bad.
[134:59.59]We have to apologize.
[135:04.35]Don't stop skipping.
[135:10.60]Cake is cold.
[135:13.87]Donuts.
[135:16.45]Cookie tin.
[135:17.01]Uh, rats?
[135:20.73]Rats are cold-blooded, so... It's so easy.
[135:38.40]Is it really that easy?
[135:51.41]Alright, now it's coming back to us.
[135:54.33]The bygone days of youth.
[135:56.91]We used to have a collection of cold things.
[136:00.56]To think Earth had so many cold things.
[136:03.62]You did good.
[136:05.73]We think you're big enough to hear about this.
[136:08.90]Hey, Nick.
[136:10.96]What kind of thirsty?
[136:12.48]Want something to drink?
[136:14.06]Thought so.
[136:14.62]Rolling is thirsty kind of work.
[136:19.25]Hydration is important.
[136:20.41]We need a nice drink, but not too excess.
[136:23.13]No glugging or chugging.
[136:25.37]Can't risk wetting the bed.
[136:26.73]Yes, such trauma.
[136:28.99]Other kids can be so cruel, you know.
[136:31.32]Hmm.
[136:31.88]How long did we wet the bed?
[136:33.30]Let's see.
[136:34.58]That was, uh... Wait!
[136:35.84]You first, Nick.
[136:37.56]Well, you stopped doing that ages ago.
[136:39.98]Seriously, at your age.
[136:41.64]But we didn't stop until we were almost, uh... Oh, backpedal.
[136:46.33]We've, like, never wet the bed.
[136:49.07]Ever.
[136:49.33]We didn't even need diapers as a baby.
[136:51.69]You talk about the weirdest things, really.
[136:54.21]Phew, we're thirsty.
[136:54.94]Go on, find us a drink.
[137:12.72]These games are so weird.
[137:15.44]They're just strange.
[137:18.28]Is that Tabasco?
[137:20.49]Better be.
[137:23.39]In the Tabasco versus... I don't even know the name of it.
[137:29.49]It's so bad that I can't even tell you what its name is.
[137:33.13]I don't know.
[137:33.67]It has a chicken on it.
[137:39.05]Sriracha.
[137:39.71]Yeah.
[137:42.84]It's coming back to us.
[137:43.58]The bygone days of youth.
[137:45.40]We used to have a collection of drinks.
[137:50.12]To think Earth had so many drinks.
[137:53.52]You did good.
[137:54.12]Oh, we think you're big enough to hear about this.
[137:57.65]Okie dokie.
[137:59.09]Sound.
[137:59.53]Go collect stuff that makes sound.
[138:02.87]Boomer actually likes Tabasco.
[138:04.53]Oh, mega lull.
[138:08.88]I just don't think Sriracha's very good.
[138:14.12]I like Tabasco.
[138:14.94]Tabasco is fantastic.
[138:16.22]It's what you should be putting on.
[138:19.61]Oysters.
[138:20.53]It's what you should be putting on pizza.
[138:22.27]It's what you should be putting on eggs.
[138:35.77]This is important to me.
[138:39.90]I want to know how many people I would not invite over for dinner.
[138:45.60]And I wouldn't let you in my house.
[139:02.23]Okay.
[139:11.20]I almost just spelled it wrong, but whatever.
[139:14.89]Is it like sriracha or is it siracha?
[139:23.26]It's sriracha.
[139:26.08]Okay.
[139:32.64]Let's find out.
[139:38.96]I have to put this on hold for just a second.
[139:55.47]Come on.
[139:56.13]What do you mean they both suck?
[140:12.44]Hey, looks like the... This is really close.
[140:19.86]51% like Tabasco more than Sriracha.
[140:22.52]Half of you were invited over to my house for dinner.
[140:29.53]Well, 52%.
[140:39.48]I'll bring the Sriracha.
[140:40.58]Hey!
[140:41.36]Invite... What are you having?
[140:46.10]Something I can ruin with Sriracha?
[140:48.90]Yeah, I'll bring it.
[140:53.73]You're not invited over to my house either.
[140:56.83]That's alright.
[141:06.09]Sriracha is good in noodle dishes, idiot.
[141:11.70]I don't put it in anything.
[141:16.16]And if it's in the food, if I order, like, let's say ramen in the Sriracha, they put it in the broth, I immediately send it back.
[141:24.60]And I say, oh, excuse me.
[141:27.06]Excuse me.
[141:27.46]Excuse me.
[141:29.08]Waiter, excuse me.
[141:31.75]Is there Sriracha in here?
[141:34.09]Yeah, it's part of the broth.
[141:36.18]Okay.
[141:38.80]Chair against the ground.
[141:40.32]Standing up.
[141:46.45]Green leader thanks to the five subs.
[141:52.61]No, I will eat Sriracha.
[141:54.23]I just refuse to put it on something.
[141:56.01]If it's in something.
[141:58.13]A lot of spicy mayos are made with Sriracha.
[142:00.60]That's fine.
[142:03.46]I'll eat it.
[142:05.81]I'm not going to put it on anything.
[142:12.40]What about the guitar?
[142:13.22]I need sounds.
[142:14.04]Okay.
[142:14.96]You can take out the violin.
[142:19.34]Imagine liking mayonnaise.
[142:39.80]This is a yes or no question.
[142:49.11]I'm not gonna tell you how I feel, because I want a completely unbiased opinion on this.
[142:53.23]I'll let that run for a little bit.
[143:04.51]Okay, good.
[143:05.96]I'm glad a majority of you guys know the deal.
[143:10.82]Silver!
[143:11.28]9992.
[143:11.30]Thanks for the 10 more subs.
[143:13.56]10 minute subs from Silver.
[143:18.96]Sound!
[143:19.34]Go collect sound.
[143:19.86]Okay, I gotta get sound.
[143:21.34]That's not corn.
[143:23.86]Musical instruments.
[143:31.14]There's some musical instruments out here.
[143:32.96]Pianos, trumpets.
[143:33.82]I don't see anything.
[143:39.83]Yes, and yeah, I am completely aware that there's a scale of mayonnaise being gross.
[143:47.24]If you get the good shit, the real good shit.
[143:52.72]Yeah.
[143:54.34]I'm gonna make a lot of people upset here.
[143:56.50]You know what?
[143:57.62]This is such a fucked up opinion to a lot of people.
[144:00.46]I might actually lose some of you as viewers for saying this.
[144:04.86]It's actually very possible.
[144:07.26]When I say this, some of you might now have such a bad opinion of me that you don't want to be here anymore.
[144:14.24]It's like...
[144:17.56]I do, ooh.
[144:20.90]I do, I like, I don't, not every time.
[144:24.16]But if sometimes when I feel like it, if I really feel like it, I do my French fries English style.
[144:31.39]That's right.
[144:33.19]I'm one of those sickos.
[144:34.27]I don't even need to say what that means.
[144:47.07]feels good to remember oh he's getting bigger you've heard some of the story we were wondering how are you with cold more cold cold cold cold cold cold cold what do you mean by that uh okay you ready I'd like to dip my french fries in mayonnaise okay I'm done I said it and now I'm I've lost you not every time
[145:17.14]Not every time.
[145:19.46]Only sometimes.
[145:21.67]That's not... I don't do like... It's not the catch up.
[145:25.87]It's English style.
[145:31.51]I know.
[145:32.38]A lot of... When you tell that to people... They don't look at you the same ever again.
[145:42.09]Yeah, sometimes I do french fries and mayonnaise.
[145:44.61]I like the texture and I like the kind of deep flavor with the fries and the crispiness.
[145:51.58]And you may as well just tell them that you love to swallow fucking spit.
[145:55.70]Like, I may have just asked that person to spit in my mouth.
[146:00.79]Hey, if I lean back, will you spit in my mouth?
[146:04.59]Uh, what the fuck?
[146:09.03]That's the kind of reaction.
[146:26.27]Do I like pizza and ranch?
[146:27.75]I'm... I'm... Yes.
[146:30.39]Pizza... There's another one.
[146:32.15]Pizza and blue cheese.
[146:34.31]Pepperoni pizza and blue cheese.
[146:36.27]Dressing.
[146:37.39]Get out of town, man.
[146:38.39]How many of you hate me now?
[146:41.83]I gotta stop going around the same circle.
[146:54.69]This guy's a sicko.
[146:55.83]I'm not a sicko.
[146:59.01]See, I told you.
[147:01.79]It's like going to a restaurant and saying, I want, could you give me a side of mayonnaise to dip my fries in?
[147:11.56]Rewind.
[147:14.18]Hey, could you go into the cat litter and dig out cat shit and put it on my poop?
[147:19.96]Same reaction.
[147:28.27]I need luxury.
[147:33.83]Lily pads aren't luxurious.
[147:39.35]And we need animals now.
[147:43.79]Earth has lots of living things, not as many as it used to, which makes us sad.
[147:48.17]Here's an idea.
[147:48.79]You can roll up creatures.
[147:51.10]Everyone needs to pick me up now and then, yes?
[147:53.98]Do you have any favorite friends?
[147:56.16]English style.
[147:59.54]Small ones, slow ones, snails, mouse, lemurs?
[148:03.61]We prefer the giants, so we can play with them.
[148:07.61]Whenever we're on Earth, we visit with whales.
[148:10.61]We swim and jump and feast by the light of the stars.
[148:14.32]They're our old friends.
[148:15.86]And we can't find them, though.
[148:18.78]Did we offend them?
[148:19.98]That would be just awful.
[148:21.60]We have big friends on other stars, too.
[148:25.49]We got big friends.
[148:26.71]Big enough to wrestle.
[148:28.69]Like the fearsome twofer.
[148:32.58]Yep, you did.
[149:02.24]Alright, animals!
[149:03.66]There we go.
[149:12.61]Con materialism.
[149:13.35]I think I already did it.
[149:17.89]People are animals.
[149:19.57]Yeah, I guess that's true.
[149:22.53]People are just, we're the animals, right?
[149:28.46]I mean, no.
[149:37.17]People are animals.
[149:38.09]People aren't animals.
[149:41.09]They are.
[149:44.12]We're a species of animal.
[149:46.12]Okay, I'm gonna... Do a states tier list.
[149:53.30]It would be, like, Massachusetts, Nevada... I don't know, like, New Hampshire?
[150:02.31]I've only been to, like, five states, guys.
[150:07.10]How am I supposed to do that?
[150:18.65]Well, that's not true.
[150:19.43]I've traveled to a bunch of states.
[150:23.45]But I haven't spent enough time in them to put them on a tier list.
[150:34.72]Earth has so many plants.
[150:35.60]Can I get them in here?
[150:36.80]Look at all these sunflowers.
[150:41.66]Alright, name a state, I'll tell you if I've been there before.
[150:52.95]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[150:53.89]Name a state, I'll tell you if I've been there for more than three days.
[151:00.95]Kansas, no.
[151:02.86]California, yes.
[151:08.33]Alaska.
[151:09.81]No.
[151:11.41]Rhode Island, yes.
[151:13.89]Arizona, no.
[151:18.61]I've been to the Arizona... I've been to the Phoenix Airport for 30 minutes.
[151:27.04]Colorado, no.
[151:28.90]New Mexico, no.
[151:32.31]New Hampshire, yes.
[151:36.29]Germany is not a state in America, but no.
[151:40.72]Georgia, no.
[151:44.92]Michigan, no.
[151:49.78]South Carolina, no.
[151:53.07]Pennsylvania, um...
[151:56.57]No.
[151:57.79]Oklahoma, no.
[151:59.01]Connecticut, yes.
[152:00.89]New Jersey, no.
[152:03.97]Maryland, yes.
[152:06.13]Oregon, no.
[152:07.71]New York, yes.
[152:11.06]Illinois, yes.
[152:15.80]Nevada.
[152:21.72]Wyoming, no.
[152:23.66]Massachusetts, yes.
[152:26.25]Rhode Island, yes.
[152:26.97]I already said that one.
[152:30.11]Texas.
[152:31.88]Interestingly enough, no.
[152:36.04]I, in fact, have never even been to the state of Texas.
[152:38.64]Not even once in my life.
[152:40.14]Never.
[152:41.02]Like, even for a connecting flight or something.
[152:46.38]I've never been to Texas.
[152:52.70]I've been to Rhode Island, but not Texas.
[152:55.52]Yeah, I lived in New England for 30 years.
[152:59.06]How would I not go to Rhode Island?
[153:03.87]Maine, yes.
[153:06.53]Oh, our papa can still lift us, you know.
[153:09.25]But we can lift you, so we're even.
[153:12.12]Ooh, getting too near the deep end of the pool Let's just stick to rolling up powerful stuff
[153:38.25]Um, what's a surprising one that people think I would have, but didn't have?
[153:45.33]Florida, yes Minnesota, nope California, yeah New York, yeah
[154:01.69]Montana.
[154:02.19]No.
[154:04.25]Alabama.
[154:04.87]Nope.
[154:06.59]Lots of powerful things.
[154:09.77]Arkansas.
[154:10.53]Nope.
[154:11.97]Quebec.
[154:16.73]Nope.
[154:17.59]That's Canada.
[154:20.08]Alright, we need to roll up playtime.
[154:27.62]He's getting big.
[154:33.44]Have I not been to New Jersey?
[154:35.94]Well, I've been... I've been in New Jersey, but I've never been there for more than a couple days.
[154:44.99]Yes, I've driven down the... I've driven through New Jersey.
[154:50.59]And I've spent maybe like two hours there.
[155:00.11]I'm a pumped Brazil.
[155:06.86]Twelve?
[155:07.28]Oh, come on.
[155:09.90]And two hours is enough.
[155:14.83]But that's... Okay, here's the thing.
[155:16.11]A lot of people don't realize, especially if you're not American.
[155:21.49]If you're a non-American watching right now, you're probably like, wait, how the fuck... You live in the United States?
[155:25.95]How have you never been to some of these places?
[155:30.15]And why I don't have a reason is... They may as well be other countries.
[155:35.86]Look, I know you can go from, like, France to Denmark in, like, seven hours in a fucking train.
[155:42.59]It's a, it's, USA is huge, and it may as well be, like, eight different countries.
[155:56.08]From the climate, from the different climates that are in America, to the different types of people that are, the different cultures, it's a huge place.
[156:08.86]And I know, I know I do my prize English style.
[156:14.28]But I'm an American.
[156:28.04]But yeah, people always go, how is it... Alright, let me tell you something.
[156:33.91]The difference between Nevada and Alabama...
[156:40.69]We may as well be on other planets.
[156:49.81]One of them is like the desert.
[156:52.77]And the other one is like a swamp.
[156:58.68]The United States is just Dark Souls.
[157:02.54]It's just a Dark Souls map.
[157:07.16]It's a video game region.
[157:09.89]It's Warcraft zones!
[157:16.60]I gotta roll ocean stuff.
[157:23.84]I'm getting huge!
[157:36.82]Yep.
[157:37.66]Yeah, VRJosh.
[157:39.44]I have not paid attention.
[157:40.82]I have not even been looking at the screen.
[157:43.38]I've been reading chat for at least 10 to 12 straight minutes.
[157:47.84]I've just been moving the sticks.
[158:05.85]How long is this level?
[158:07.13]That's a great question.
[158:08.11]Long enough to hopefully not fail.
[158:11.77]What's my opinion on ketchup?
[158:13.63]It's good.
[158:15.67]It's good.
[158:16.33]I like it.
[158:26.00]It's unfailable.
[158:27.04]Oh, cool.
[158:28.80]Ketchup and mayonnaise.
[158:30.74]Well, you just made a dressing.
[158:33.22]Ketchup and mayonnaise is a thing already.
[158:36.71]Thousand Island?
[158:37.92]What is it?
[158:38.30]Ketchup Bazaar, you think?
[158:48.30]Ketchup and hot sauce.
[158:49.26]Now you got my attention.
[158:58.23]I can't really eat it anymore.
[159:01.79]But I was a fiend for Tabasco and ketchup.
[159:08.35]You would do ketchup in a little thing, a little cup.
[159:14.76]Into the cup with the... That's all you need.
[159:17.06]And then Ster it up with a french fry.
[159:18.30]Oh man, I miss those days.
[159:31.04]That's the bloop bloop.
[159:34.31]You do like two or three bloop bloops, and that's all you need.
[159:36.59]You don't need anything else.
[159:39.33]More energy!
[159:48.77]More energy, and that's what I'm doing.
[159:54.16]When is he eating the ghost pepper?
[159:55.26]I already did, man.
[160:00.63]Oh, it burned.
[160:04.95]It sucks.
[160:09.25]Tears, you see tears?
[160:10.13]Tears are coming down.
[160:12.37]Tears are coming down.
[160:15.00]I don't know how to play this game.
[160:28.36]I don't know how to plug in.
[160:35.61]Whee!
[160:35.91]Look at how big we've gotten.
[160:37.09]I've been to Nebraska, though.
[160:40.55]I've never been to Nebraska.
[160:43.01]I was gonna stop you before.
[160:56.56]Alright, we're hopefully nearly full grown.
[161:06.27]We've managed to put on some size, haven't we?
[161:08.98]We find the sound of our own voices soothing.
[161:12.50]We sort of lose track of everything else.
[161:15.44]But we're quite content with the job you've done.
[161:18.21]You're free to roll up whatever you like.
[161:19.61]We'll nap.
[161:20.65]If you'd like to stop just hit the X button.
[161:44.19]What about the DLC levels?
[161:54.92]They're going to be... The DLC levels are going to be just not even interesting.
[161:59.66]If I roll up every single thing in game.
[162:09.99]Oh, I got something.
[162:16.29]roll up the king here he is rolled up he's in there the DLC levels are more themed now I'm getting flashbacks I don't want to be going with the big cosmos thing again
[162:45.05]I beat it.
[162:48.35]Let's do these themed levels.
[162:49.83]Just get it over.
[162:50.85]Just get it over with and do the mayo tier list.
[162:57.79]Didn't I already do condiments?
[162:59.07]Did I?
[162:59.43]I didn't do condiments?
[163:01.95]Come on.
[163:06.50]How did I not do condiments?
[163:11.44]I did.
[163:14.10]Yeah, I did.
[163:20.69]1,494 memories.
[163:21.57]Anybody got it already?
[163:26.47]This is my list?
[163:27.45]That's not a tier list.
[163:31.01]That's... That's... Jerma... Jerma... Uh...
[163:50.57]Basantracha?
[163:51.81]Sucks.
[163:55.14]Germopepper, let me see.
[164:03.38]This is the same thing.
[164:06.06]Ooh!
[164:07.74]A horse!
[164:10.67]I can have the king head on, that's cool.
[164:17.33]And that's... I've never taken giraffe off.
[164:23.10]I've never had Old Bay.
[164:24.36]Yeah, I have... Old Bay's alright.
[164:29.60]It's good on a lot of stuff, but I wouldn't just put it on anything.
[164:39.26]Do I like my steak with A1?
[164:42.62]Back when I was like 14, I would put A1 on steak because I thought it made me more of an adult.
[164:51.19]I thought ordering A1 made me look older and look like I knew what I was talking about at restaurants.
[165:00.91]Also, another funny thing, I used to lie to my dentist all the time for no reason when I was like 13.
[165:06.22]I would tell them, I don't know, and my brother used to laugh his ass off at this.
[165:12.46]He still brings it up sometimes.
[165:14.76]When I would be in the chair and we'd be talking about how things are going.
[165:19.22]Uh, yeah, any concerns, anything going on?
[165:20.88]Yeah, yeah, brushing twice a day, yeah.
[165:22.87]You flossing?
[165:23.47]Uh, yeah, I'm flossing.
[165:25.67]And I've been chewing a lot of Trident, too.
[165:27.39]Like, yeah, I've been chewing Trident gum.
[165:30.93]Because that was the one that was supposed to clean your mouth from all the commercials.
[165:38.64]And the dentist would always be like, oh, okay.
[165:47.32]And that is a straight-up lie, right?
[165:49.58]It is.
[165:53.41]They used to have commercials for Trident where it was... it cleaned your teeth.
[166:03.61]Is that real?
[166:04.53]It can't be.
[166:12.20]Is it true?
[166:18.60]Backpack is funner.
[166:29.16]Okay, now I'm going to stay with the giraffe.
[166:33.64]Katamari Memorial.
[166:37.80]Go to the crown?
[166:38.42]What do you think I'm doing?
[166:40.88]I did all this before.
[166:41.64]I've already done this.
[166:47.63]I've done this.
[166:49.91]Oh, you want to play the music!
[166:53.65]Not this one.
[166:56.22]What's it called?
[167:10.68]Where's my favorite song?
[167:24.67]What's it called?
[167:25.31]Is this it?
[167:40.64]Alright, viewers gonna go up or down?
[167:42.08]Viewers gonna go up or down?
[167:42.96]Viewers gonna go up or down?
[167:44.00]Which one?
[167:45.20]Viewers up or down?
[167:46.06]Which one?
[167:57.11]I'm watching closely
[168:05.98]What up?
[168:13.21]What up?
[168:14.75]What up?
[168:33.44]Test that sorry, I apologize Okay, it's time for advanced this is DLC And let me go off on a little bit of our rant here.
[168:50.64]I had to buy all this DLC Individually, they're $1 each so I had to check out of the fucking Microsoft Store and
[169:03.00]seven separate times in a row for a $1 purchase.
[169:08.70]There is no bundle.
[169:09.94]You cannot add to cart.
[169:13.37]I thought my credit card was gonna get declined at number five.
[169:20.65]Get away from me.
[169:23.92]That person has like a stew in their head?
[169:26.52]What is that?
[169:35.41]One dollar purchases.
[169:37.27]You gotta put the credit card.
[169:39.15]Alright, here we go.
[169:42.03]Create a space station within the budget.
[169:44.68]This is DLC.
[169:46.26]You've never seen this before.
[169:47.48]Nobody here has.
[169:50.76]Welcome to the swanky, fancy, and schmancies.
[169:53.72]We need stuff for a space station.
[169:56.00]So collect lots of things to make it well-equipped.
[169:58.85]Food, stationery, toilet paper, electronics.
[170:05.23]Finally the title makes sense.
[170:07.43]Oh, fuck.
[170:08.05]Yeah.
[170:11.58]The title is now accurate.
[170:13.74]It's taken three hours.
[170:20.81]It's okay.
[170:22.09]Nobody knows what this game is.
[170:35.27]We want Ayaya.
[170:39.38]Open up a new tab.
[170:40.34]Type in Katamari OST.
[170:43.02]Go to the section that has that song and play it over and mute me.
[170:48.62]Attention shoppers, what a nice big store.
[170:50.36]So bright, so clean.
[170:51.20]What an extraordinary shop.
[170:52.87]Must be why it's called a supermarket.
[170:56.53]Anywho, we have another special rule for you.
[170:59.03]Today's topic, shopping.
[171:00.03]Roll up many things.
[171:01.85]By the way, all sorts of currencies are used on Earth.
[171:05.65]You know, dollars, rupees, pesos, euros, and such.
[171:08.89]Too many for us to keep count.
[171:11.03]Let's just use Japanese money this time.
[171:14.95]Strange mark.
[171:16.41]Looks like chicken scratch.
[171:18.65]Anywho, we'll give you $300,000.
[171:19.53]That's a lot of money.
[171:23.75]Go on a shopping spree.
[171:25.43]But the key here is to make the most out of your money.
[171:28.85]So pick up a lot of cheap things.
[171:32.03]It's for a space station, so get going.
[171:34.09]Shoo.
[171:34.59]Okay, I got $300,000.
[171:35.37]Eggs are cheap.
[171:35.91]$50,000.

[172:22.13]What are those Kool-Aid bursts for?
[172:32.04]Fish cake sausages are expensive, aren't they?
[172:36.38]Yeah, that's too much money to start.
[172:44.81]You lost 100 viewers.
[172:45.55]That's because I stopped playing the song.
[172:51.05]Did you know that some people have a program set up that any music... How much were those?
[173:02.00]I have to pay attention to that.
[173:08.54]Sea urchins are... actually, sea urchins are cheap, aren't they?

[176:46.63]What'd I do?
[176:50.61]Oh, this is all on sale.
[176:55.03]That shit's not on sale.
[176:56.45]It's over.
[176:59.39]98... 98 for these!
[177:01.65]So what's the deal?
[177:02.39]That's way more than 98 per can of tuna!
[177:05.95]What?!
[177:19.16]The bottom shelf wasn't on sale?
[177:21.28]Really?
[177:21.62]There's like 200 cans there.
[177:28.92]Do you know how sales work?
[177:30.22]Yeah, there's a huge sticker that says everything here is 98 yen.
[177:33.34]They have gold bars on the shelf.
[177:40.86]Shit.
[177:42.60]98 times 100 cans equals $98,000, Jeremy.
[178:00.76]$98,000?
[178:00.78]I think your math is off.
[178:27.33]Fruit, vegetables, and cooking supplies.
[178:29.57]And I've got a cousin.
[178:47.58]Melons are only grown in Shizuoka Prefecture in central Japan.
[178:54.17]They can cost over $200 each.
[178:57.61]Unlike the $5 mass-produced melons you're likely to come across in a western supermarket, crown melons take constant care and attention to grow.
[179:04.29]They've been growing these melons for 60 years at his farm.
[179:14.48]It's pasta.
[179:16.01]Okay.
[179:16.43]Well, David saved it thanks to the five community subs.
[179:27.33]Not DLC.
[179:28.19]Get it out of here.
[179:32.11]Alright, let's get some more DLC.
[179:33.37]There's one over here.
[179:38.87]There's actually two over here.
[179:41.61]No, it's this one.
[179:43.29]Munchy's Manor.
[179:45.03]Roll up food to make... Cetus.
[179:49.74]Well, melons are gross anyways.
[180:00.31]That's the fruit that you avoid in the fruit cup.
[180:03.15]Until you have nothing left.
[180:04.53]You don't have any more grapes, any more strawberries, any more pineapple pieces.
[180:07.53]You just have melons there.
[180:10.60]That's the avoiding fruit.
[180:13.10]And then you're like, alright, I guess I'll eat the melon.
[180:25.12]What you need to collect are tons and tons of food.
[180:32.07]Vegetables, fruits, and snacks.
[180:33.53]All that yum.
[180:36.55]Whales eat four times their own weight in a day, yes?
[180:40.82]So vast amounts of nutrients are in order.
[180:47.66]Wait.
[180:48.60]Hold on.
[180:48.98]Yeah.
[180:49.56]Somebody said I'm thinking about cantaloupes.
[180:52.98]It's cantaloupe.
[180:53.62]That's what I'm thinking of, right?
[180:55.48]No, maybe is it.
[180:56.18]Maybe it's not.
[181:01.67]Now, cantaloupe is a melon.
[181:02.75]So that's... Yeah.
[181:05.04]Cantaloupe is a melon.
[181:05.70]Yeah, it's the gross one that's in the can.
[181:07.42]It's the gross one that's in the cup.
[181:12.15]And I know everyone in the chat right now is like, what am I?
[181:15.51]Oh, yeah.
[181:15.93]Let me eat my fruit cup and get to the melons.
[181:18.88]And half of them are hard chunks that have like the rinds part still there.
[181:26.96]That you like, you end up like spitting them out.
[181:40.95]Something smells good.
[181:41.85]Mmm, delicious.
[181:53.11]No, I don't like melon.

[182:16.42]I forgot what I was going to say.
[182:17.75]I don't remember what the thing I said after the melons.
[182:20.35]It was... Fuck.
[182:23.07]It was really polarizing.
[182:24.03]What was it?
[182:30.51]God damn it.
[182:31.07]What was it?
[182:35.56]Melons don't like melons.
[182:36.86]And then... It's gone.
[182:39.70]I don't know.
[182:40.78]It's gone.
[182:45.36]Was it a fruit?
[182:46.94]nope maybe it was no this is gonna kill me no I don't know I hate when this happens how would I transition from cantaloupe I need calories what do you calorie down where's the tahini paste

[183:37.94]Lots of- look at that.

[183:41.76]That was a shitload.
[183:43.41]In the freezer.
[183:43.83]Milk.
[183:43.99]Whole milk.
[183:57.13]Gross.
[183:59.05]Mushrooms are calorie dense.
[184:03.73]Alright, we need some...
[184:25.09]Food I didn't like, that people love, that I hate.
[184:31.59]It's gonna pop up in like an hour.
[184:36.91]Muffins.
[184:38.48]Very calorie rich.
[184:39.46]Ooh, look at all those cookies.
[184:47.46]Maybe up there.
[184:51.89]This is it, right?
[184:52.47]I checked this out.
[184:53.31]All the desserts are gonna go for like 300,000 calories.
[185:03.28]Bread, too?
[185:04.06]Oh god, like, bread?
[185:07.36]Disgusting.
[185:10.92]I can't, in good conscience, say that.
[185:13.04]I love, I love bread so much.
[185:15.70]And it's so bad because I'd like everyone else to eat it anyway.
[185:21.19]Fresh rolls at dinner is like one of my favorite things in the world Come on get up there slow down Yeah
[185:53.08]Tomato box.
[185:54.70]Alright, let's get out of here.
[185:59.22]Flower.
[186:02.46]Nothing else in here?
[186:04.56]Until lunch.
[186:05.10]I want to get up top, but I'm not big enough to get up there.
[186:13.69]Alright, whatever.
[186:15.89]I'll just grab it.
[186:16.69]Okay, I'm up.
[186:20.54]I'm stuck.
[186:23.78]Ohhh!
[186:32.15]Holy shit.
[186:34.17]That was a lot.
[186:35.91]Where am I?
[186:42.49]Ohhh!
[186:45.17]And all the cake!
[186:50.17]Anything else?
[186:55.89]Crabs!
[186:57.15]Into the produce section again.
[187:00.10]No, don't get stuck!
[187:01.24]Don't get stuck!
[187:03.30]600 down!
[187:05.30]Nice.
[187:20.32]Have I ever swallowed gum on purpose?
[187:21.68]No.
[187:22.81]It gives me anxiety.
[187:24.53]Because I was told that it takes nine years to have gum go through your whole digestive system, so it made me scared forever.
[187:48.46]It's only seven years.
[187:53.24]How would a rumor like that even start?
[187:57.03]To scare you?
[187:58.55]It was done?
[187:59.45]No, I know.
[188:00.19]It was parents trying to scare their kids.
[188:03.09]So they- cause kids- Oh, this is yummy, delicious, tastes like fruits!
[188:06.53]No, you're not supposed to swallow the gum.
[188:08.89]So what if we just tell- make up this huge lie about if you swallow it, you're fucked for ten years.
[188:15.86]Don't swallow that gum, little Timmy.
[188:19.04]It's gonna stay in you for seven years.
[188:22.70]It terrifies you.
[188:24.96]I get it.
[188:31.55]It's kind of funny because I'm pretty sure if bagel and cream cheese takes longer to go through your body than gum if you were to swallow it.
[188:37.11]It takes like four days.
[188:56.10]It's worth it, though.
[188:57.84]Yeah, it is.
[188:58.38]Oh, look at the big whale!
[189:03.21]That was barely worth it.
[189:09.85]What kind of bagels do I like?
[189:11.25]I like everything bagels.
[189:14.00]Or onion.
[189:20.00]Uh, is this, uh, DLC or no?
[189:21.36]One of them here is, isn't it?
[189:26.28]I will tell you, I'm not a sugary bagel kind of guy.
[189:32.43]Cinnamon raisin bagels, no.
[189:35.17]French toast bagel, no.
[189:38.59]Not into it.
[189:46.72]There's one down here.
[189:48.64]Lover's loom!
[189:51.46]Roll up fabric to make Vega.
[189:55.95]Salmon bagel?
[189:56.53]Yeah, salmon... I like it.
[189:59.49]I have to be in the mood for smoked salmon on a bagel, though.
[190:04.36]That's not something that I want every day, but I do like it.
[190:13.18]Yeah, smoked salmon cream cheese, it's great.
[190:15.40]You gotta really be in the mood for it, though.
[190:18.80]It's kind of heavy.
[190:24.36]Bread, yes, yarn, two-string, even cloth.
[190:26.36]Bagels have more sugar than a candy bar.
[190:28.67]Yeah, isn't white bread the equivalent of eating cotton candy?
[190:32.09]Like in your body, just processed the same way.
[190:53.80]it's worse is it I've heard I'm just telling you what I've heard cream cheese capers that's the only place where I think I would ever have actual want capers is on lox and bagels
[191:24.39]It's only in America you guys are strange and put sugar in everything.
[191:29.90]I'm not into that.
[191:31.34]Wait!
[191:32.82]Special rule for the day.
[191:34.60]Make a big ball of yarn and string.
[191:36.90]Look at that.
[191:37.22]I love this level already.
[191:40.09]This makes me want to play Zuma.
[191:43.91]Let's say this big.
[191:46.05]In three minutes, one meter.
[191:48.19]That's not very much time.
[191:53.33]okay yarn cloth string be crafting spin a ball of many colors alright let's try it well I'm too small for that what the hell can I even pick up here I need to pick up something okay can I get
[192:27.87]This one's gonna be satisfying.
[192:28.91]Check this.
[192:33.88]Any more colors than red?
[192:37.32]Uh, no, I don't like... We've gone over this before on stream, but just for people that have never been here.
[192:45.47]You're only supposed to take in... I think... men are supposed to take in... 38 grams of added sugar a day, and I think... I think women are supposed... it's like 32 or 34 or something.
[192:58.18]It's a little lower.
[193:00.86]But one can of Coke is your whole daily allowed limit for added sugar.
[193:07.20]That's, like, kind of fucked up.
[193:20.03]I drink three Cokes a day.
[193:21.31]Dude, I used to pound Code Red.
[193:24.40]I would drink Code Red every day.
[193:26.48]I gotta go back downstairs.
[193:31.72]I love this level.
[193:32.58]I really do.
[193:36.44]This level is awesome.
[193:37.20]I might replay this level just to feel good.
[193:45.51]Sugar is everywhere.
[193:48.16]Only taken 37, 38 grams of sugar a day added.
[193:52.97]Like, damn, that's hard to do.
[194:02.20]It's in everything.
[194:06.92]And then you say, well, I'll just do sugar-free.
[194:09.97]That shit's bad for you, too.
[194:17.48]Look at how big that one is.
[194:32.37]Go through!
[194:33.05]Go through!
[194:33.75]One minute thirty seconds!
[194:36.77]Up the stairs one more time.
[194:39.89]Can I just plunge ice in my mouth?
[194:48.47]That means you have an iron deficiency.
[194:49.75]Look it up.
[194:54.66]Stop, I can't go through.
[195:06.89]That's alright, I got two big.
[195:16.82]What can you eat with iron in it?
[195:17.92]Spinach.
[195:21.36]Most meats.
[195:23.06]Liver.
[195:24.57]I don't like chicken liver, but chicken liver is one of the highest places you can get actual, good, real iron.
[195:31.39]I think it's gross, so I can't do it.
[195:33.93]But you can get it from spinach.
[195:42.49]Spinach iron content is not great.
[195:44.57]That's a lie.
[195:46.99]Well, it's one of the plant-based ways you get... It's not the same kind of iron you get from meat.
[195:51.47]No, I agree with you.
[195:54.46]Still there.
[196:05.52]Iron is just iron.
[196:06.36]It's not true.
[196:17.57]Researchers found that the intake of meat heme iron, but not plant non-heme iron, was associated with an increased risk of stroke.
[196:31.12]Uh... They're different.
[196:34.68]They're different.
[196:35.90]There's heme and non-heme iron.
[196:39.78]Okay, well... Whatever.
[196:41.74]Who cares?
[196:51.31]Oh, yeah, I know what I'm talking about don't eat that a he bay iron But no chicken liver oysters to that's another one I don't it's the worst thing ever because I
[197:15.51]But let me save you guys.
[197:18.37]I will rescue everybody in here that needs to get more iron in the diet.
[197:22.25]Let me save you.
[197:22.87]Let me rescue you.
[197:23.99]Listen to me closely.
[197:26.03]What's the one food that I told you that I was really into and I was buying and I was eating it like before streams and after streams?
[197:33.02]What was it?
[197:35.42]No, not garlic.
[197:37.54]It was like a four-day tirade.
[197:40.78]Not tuna.
[197:41.24]You're close.
[197:44.83]You're close!
[197:47.14]I talked about this for like three straight days.
[197:49.78]They come in a can.
[197:50.94]They come in a tin.
[197:53.98]Sardines!
[197:54.52]Somebody got it, finally.
[197:57.00]Uh, sardines are one of the best foods you can possibly consume.
[198:00.18]On Earth.
[198:03.93]They got iron, they got vitamins, they got minerals, they got protein.
[198:08.21]It's good shit.
[198:09.01]It's really good for you.
[198:09.89]Except for the sodium.
[198:13.49]yeah and apples have cyanide in them you can't win and coffee gives you diarrhea and garlic gives you heartburn you can't there's no you can't win guys there's no winning with food you just pick you try your best
[198:46.79]Did I do this one?
[198:47.69]No.
[198:48.77]Roll up constellation-related things to make the Milky Way.
[199:00.40]Anyone who has ever eaten has died.
[199:02.31]That's true.
[199:05.85]But, I mean, not from eating.
[199:10.17]Garlic.
[199:10.81]I guess garlic is really good, but everything has a con.
[199:16.87]Is there any real food on Earth that doesn't have one single con?
[199:21.87]Water.
[199:22.16]That's pretty much it.
[199:29.22]But you can drink too much water and get over-hydrated.
[199:35.10]Yes, you can drink too much water.
[199:37.02]And you can die if you drink too much water.
[199:39.28]It's true.
[199:42.89]What are we supposed to do?
[199:50.11]You could choke on a cinnamon roll, so what?
[199:52.43]I know, it's dangerous.
[200:03.22]Human breast milk?
[200:07.58]I don't think so.
[200:08.40]I don't think so.
[200:09.68]I think you're wrong there.
[200:14.97]Bootleg Snoopy, thanks for the five community subs.
[200:16.87]Appreciate it.
[200:22.51]No one said that?
[200:23.13]Yes, they did.
[200:23.60]I would never say that out loud when somebody else said it first.
[200:27.00]Hmm, looks like the yard of that glam house.
[200:31.50]All righty, let's go over the rules for this one.
[200:35.10]Constellation namesakes, does that blow your mind?
[200:38.52]Well, mind or no mind, you have this much time to gather stuff related to constellations.
[200:45.82]For constellations like Cancer, Leo, and Pegasus, you can find crabs, lions, and winged horsies.
[200:58.16]That's the equivalent of biting a red pepper, not liking the heat, and fearing the color red.
[201:20.94]That's how our ancestors did it.
[201:22.58]Let's go!
[201:34.02]How many constellations?
[201:35.56]88 constellations?
[201:42.20]Gotta get big enough to pick up the rabbit.
[201:44.70]Starfish.
[201:45.86]Crab.
[201:47.18]Hermit crab.
[201:48.12]Milk.
[201:48.84]Dog food.
[201:50.28]What constellation is dog food?
[201:56.09]Kronos.
[201:56.71]Time.
[201:59.35]Birds.
[202:06.94]Dumplings.
[202:09.16]I'm not sure what that's supposed to be.
[202:10.86]Is there a god of hot dogs?
[202:15.12]Nope, that's news to me.
[202:25.81]Oh, another thing, like, but you guys, speaking of hot dogs, did you guys know that a hot dog can legally be called a hot dog if it has 40% plastic in it?
[202:36.10]Pay attention to what you're eating.
[202:39.58]Before anybody, like, leaves the channel, that, like, is just kind of... That's not true.
[202:42.28]That's a lie.
[202:42.95]I'm kidding.
[202:44.33]That's an actual fucking dumb lie.
[202:46.23]Like, somebody may be, like, about to leave and clicking the X. Like, what the fuck?
[202:48.99]Is that true?
[202:49.37]And then look it up and, like, be, like, scared.
[202:51.09]I'm just... That's a lie.
[202:51.71]I'm kidding.
[203:03.28]I've been subwaying on all that trouble.
[203:07.87]In public opinion because it was their chicken and their chicken sandwiches was like 40 or 50 percent soy I remember that And then everyone started like looking at wait a minute, what about like Taco Bell what's in that meat what's the filler they have soy in their meat
[203:32.19]I think it was like 89% meat or something.
[203:35.10]Taco Bell was close.
[203:35.84]Taco Bell was like 90 something.
[203:37.02]I think 80 or 90% actual real meat.
[203:48.67]Is it 100%?
[204:20.11]I got you.
[204:20.93]It's not 100%.
[204:23.21]Taco Bell proclaims that 88% of its beef consists of premium beef and 12% of it is made up of a, quote, signature recipe.
[204:34.35]Okay.
[204:36.98]Three or four rungs down is...
[204:43.09]Is Taco Bell horse meat?
[204:46.53]Why would you think this?
[204:48.52]Is it?
[204:49.38]What?
[204:51.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[204:52.46]Wait, this is not like a scary Google?
[204:58.75]Hold on a second.
[204:59.99]When was this?
[205:00.79]I need to read this.
[205:11.75]Taco Bell's ground beef is the... No, it's a business insider, which means I'm not allowed to look at the website.
[205:23.76]Okay, there we go.
[205:27.66]Taco Bell's ground beef is the latest food to be implicated in a horse meat scandal sweeping Europe and the UK.
[205:32.91]Is this an Onion article?
[205:34.01]I'm not like eating an onion, right?
[205:36.91]Taco Bell's ground beef is among the four new products found in the UK's Food Standards Agency to contain more than 1% horse meat.
[205:44.81]Am I eating the onion?
[205:48.38]This happened.
[205:49.88]Wait, 2013.
[205:55.06]Why would they be horse meat?
[205:57.94]What happened?
[206:03.19]EU horse eaters, what?
[206:08.01]IKEA got caught in it with their meatballs.
[206:10.27]What the fuck is happening?
[206:12.97]Wait, who?
[206:14.61]This is 2013.
[206:15.07]That's not that long ago.
[206:19.58]Burger King in Ireland admitted that some of its burgers contain horse meat.
[206:29.12]Taco Bell sent this statement to stress that the finding would not affect its U.S.
[206:33.27]businesses.
[206:34.43]Our domestic restaurants have not been and will not be impacted because we do not use any meat from Europe.
[206:41.13]We stand for quality and we use 100% premium beef.
[206:44.79]Like all beef in the United States, ours is USDA inspected and then passes our own 20 quality checkpoints.
[206:54.08]Alright.
[206:55.14]Good to know.
[207:02.34]Taco Bell 88% meat.
[207:08.30]Look at this is just like how like fucking bullshit fake articles.
[207:12.86]Hold on.
[207:14.12]So this is the headline.
[207:16.54]Taco Bell says their meat is 88% beef, not 36%.
[207:18.48]30.
[207:18.50]Well, how would it spread that it was 36% meat?
[207:37.79]People thought it was oats and starch.
[207:47.88]Oatmeat.
[207:50.66]Dude, I want to get some delicious oatmeat.
[207:55.90]Wait, 3-5% is made up of oats, starch, sugar, yeast, and citric acid.
[208:02.03]The rest is water and spices.
[208:03.45]Check the full statement below.
[208:06.48]Shit it is 5% oatmeal How long good this is 2011 Taco Bell oatmeat
[208:35.08]Wait, hold on.
[208:36.38]Taco Bell, this is... Taco Bell finally adds vegan meat to the menu, but there's a catch.
[208:43.58]It's oat meat.
[208:45.08]Is that real?
[208:45.94]I thought this was a joke.
[208:47.34]Oat meat?
[208:52.69]This is 2019.
[208:54.91]Taco Bell will launch a limited time menu that features tacos made with oat-based meat, but only in three places in London.
[209:07.43]Look at all this news.
[209:08.41]Look at all these random articles.
[209:10.25]Are you fucking with us?
[209:21.62]No?
[209:21.78]Type in Taco Bell Oatmeal.
[209:31.02]I kind of want to try that.
[209:33.85]Think about that.
[209:34.69]Think about oatmeal.
[209:36.29]It's kind of sloppy and slippery and fucking slimy and shit like ground beef is in a taco.
[209:42.07]You could probably dress that up and add it.
[209:43.67]That would make... I don't know.
[209:54.40]If you...
[209:56.04]put like beet juice in oatmeal and added like meat flavoring to it and then like filled it up with some like soy or something you might actually have like a taco meat
[210:20.39]I'm not talking shit because I've had the Beyond Burger.
[210:23.49]I've had the Impossible Burger before.
[210:24.77]They're good.
[210:25.19]They're actually good.
[210:27.43]I'm not going to lie to you.
[210:28.55]I mean, I do that all the time, but not this time.
[210:38.73]I'm not going to be one of those people that eats the Beyond Burger and goes, like, internally, oh, this is actually kind of good, but externally is like, yeah, gross.
[210:48.30]Gross.
[210:50.88]Hey, throw a steak on the barbecue for me.
[210:52.51]Make it rare.
[210:54.65]I like that.
[210:55.17]That's what I like.
[211:00.35]It's good.
[211:05.61]It tastes good.
[211:06.59]It's fine.
[211:08.17]I mean, I don't know if you want to swing it for... Is it how processed it is?
[211:15.12]Maybe.
[211:15.98]But the taste is there.
[211:23.72]And this is somebody that is also saying this.
[211:26.90]Somebody that lost five grand on it trying to short it in the stock market.
[211:31.19]Because I was like, fuck this dumb company.
[211:46.93]I'm kidding.
[211:47.81]I didn't do that.
[211:50.15]That's a lot of money.
[211:51.03]I did not do that.
[212:05.81]So it was 10, no.
[212:06.55]You know what, you better fess up.
[212:19.82]Fuck, this stock rose in value by such, since it's IPO, it's such an insane amount that it had to come back down.
[212:27.93]It was impossible, actually impossible, like their food.
[212:43.50]That shit, like, increased by, like, 300% in value.
[212:47.13]You guys ever played... I'm not... I'm not a video game.
[212:51.89]Oh, I found it.
[212:52.35]I found somebody.
[213:07.60]Do oats.
[213:13.48]No, I was gonna say Grand Theft Auto 5.
[213:15.77]You didn't do the Grand Theft Auto 5 stock market?
[213:17.51]You know how it works?
[213:27.52]I've read a few books.
[213:31.00]I read a book.
[213:31.40]It was called Timing the Stock Market.
[213:33.62]The Easiest Way to Make Money Timing the Stock Market.
[213:38.98]Written by Jeremy Elbertson.
[213:42.83]Ooh, mechanical colony.
[213:45.51]Rolled up mechanical objects to make Antlia.
[213:48.31]Antlia.
[214:01.29]Ow, fuck.
[214:03.75]What kind of name is Jeremy?
[214:07.01]If I had access to the chat right now, I would delete your comment.
[214:10.24]But, I mean, like, it's kind of a weird name, isn't it?
[214:13.98]Sorry, my name's not, like, Greg.
[214:16.54]It's Jeremy.
[214:17.96]What kind of a name is Jeremy?
[214:31.29]It's a great name, actually.
[214:35.93]Jeremy's a, I like Jeremy.
[214:39.61]Doesn't Jeremy sound like a very inviting person?
[214:42.07]Oh, that's Jeremy.
[214:51.96]That's a psycho name.
[215:01.10]I didn't even look.
[215:01.66]I'm not paying any attention.
[215:03.42]Roll it this big in this much time.
[215:04.82]Two meters, five minutes.
[215:05.98]What am I looking for here?
[215:07.26]Collect lots of mechanical stuff.
[215:09.32]Okay.
[215:11.02]This level seems kind of fun.
[215:12.40]Nope.
[215:16.36]Get the mechanical stuff.
[215:23.44]What are we, candy corn?
[215:24.51]We're not speaking to you.
[215:47.28]Alright, gotta get off.
[215:51.96]Battletoads?
[215:52.66]What about Battletoads?
[215:53.94]Why'd you say that?
[215:54.52]What are you talking about?
[215:55.16]What do you mean, Battletoads?
[215:56.62]Battletoads, like, am I a Battletoad?
[215:57.66]Do you think I'm a Toad?
[215:59.81]Do you think I'm, like, slimy and stupid and, like, gross?
[216:01.35]What do you mean, Toad?
[216:02.05]Why am I Toad?
[216:02.51]Do you think I eat bugs?
[216:05.05]Do I eat bugs?
[216:05.53]I don't eat bugs.
[216:06.07]Do you think I eat bugs?
[216:06.83]Why'd you say that?
[216:18.62]Alright, I'm obviously not the biggest.
[216:27.04]Calm down, Captain Mania.
[216:29.74]Damn, half the stuff I can't even get.
[216:54.02]This is a really good song, right?
[217:02.89]50, come on!
[217:07.19]Are there any boppers here?
[217:09.95]I don't know.
[217:14.46]Stream boppers?
[217:23.50]Get all the robots.
[217:30.42]What was the name of that goddamn food?
[217:33.35]It's all I've been trying to find it in my brain.
[217:36.95]Cantaloupe.
[217:37.53]Melons.
[217:40.21]Alright.
[217:41.03]Oh yeah!
[217:42.37]Squash.
[217:43.45]It's gross.
[217:44.45]Got it.
[217:47.89]I don't like squash at all.
[217:49.07]I don't like it.
[217:49.61]You know how I figured that out?
[217:52.31]Because there's a bunch of different kinds of melons and a bunch of different kinds of squash.
[217:55.05]It's not a fan.
[218:05.65]I think they look cool.
[218:08.50]I would have squash in my garden.
[218:10.38]Not because I like to eat them, but because I think they're interesting to look at.
[218:13.82]And I would sell them.
[218:21.92]Big pickup right there.
[218:24.50]I'm running out of time.
[218:35.15]What was it?
[218:35.47]Two meters, right?
[218:41.65]Getting there.
[218:42.47]This level is pretty cool, too.
[218:48.87]robots I don't think I can get them no I cannot look at all these sewing machines and tvs yellow and green gourd
[219:15.69]So what about yams?
[219:16.57]Yams fit in that category, right?
[219:18.61]Is a yam a squash family?
[219:21.41]Squash kind of relative or something?
[219:30.54]A yam is a potato?
[219:31.84]Uh, yeah, because I like yams.
[219:34.50]They're okay.
[219:35.60]As long as they have the dollop of melted marshmallow in them.
[219:56.83]Thanksgiving dish.
[219:58.47]Little side.
[220:00.19]It's pretty good.
[220:00.67]Here comes the failure.
[220:08.44]Here comes the failure!
[220:16.53]Hmm, failed.
[220:17.29]Level is kind of small.
[220:19.17]Try it again.
[220:21.12]Yeah, I'm going to beat it.
[220:47.11]Here we go.
[220:48.61]Better spot to start.
[220:49.45]Yeah.
[220:50.31]Looks like I'm gonna stay around the corner here and get all these... little... mosquito... salt shakers?
[220:58.39]What's a mosquito zapper?
[220:59.69]I spend a lot of time getting hit by this stuff.
[221:04.94]They, like, I just go back and... I just love them.
[221:09.24]I liked it originally.
[221:10.14]Now it's making me angry.
[221:17.53]I'm gonna go on the ground.
[221:21.37]Can't get any of this stuff.
[221:23.61]Jerma hates this level.
[221:26.73]It's a little claustrophobic.
[221:31.85]It's a little crampy.
[221:34.53]It is.
[221:34.87]It's kind of crampy.
[221:50.02]I know I can go outside eventually, I didn't do it yet, but... Alright, let me get back up on the barrier belts.
[222:11.18]I messed up here.
[222:20.54]Damn.
[222:20.94]This level's kind of fucked up.
[222:25.04]I'm not big enough to pick, though, though.
[222:32.46]Invader Bell.
[222:39.49]Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.
[222:46.27]Lots of robots.
[222:47.09]Get them.
[223:03.88]Ah, squash.
[223:04.40]That's what it was.
[223:09.20]Sorry, I haven't said a sentence in like 30 seconds.
[223:11.78]I'm sorry.
[223:14.38]Down.
[223:23.95]Down.
[223:25.07]Yes.
[223:26.05]Verve.
[223:26.45]Yeah, I know.
[223:27.35]I know.
[223:27.85]I know.
[223:29.53]Open up that door so we can get out of here.
[223:36.65]Is that door gonna open?
[223:39.05]Oh, you idiot.
[223:41.68]Yeah, we're good.
[224:04.78]Yeah, there it is now Two meters
[224:31.35]Wow, they all have cash registers and TVs on their heads.
[224:45.69]What is that?
[224:48.29]That person has a flying computer!
[224:58.42]Social commentary.
[225:02.02]We're all obsessed with consuming.
[225:05.78]We need to unplug.
[225:06.68]We're all just computers now.
[225:08.54]We all got a barcode.
[225:09.58]Well, that's how you do it.
[225:28.91]It's a walking camera.
[225:50.59]Alrighty, done.
[225:54.85]I think all the sardine iron is going to your brain.
[225:58.16]Good.
[225:59.28]That's where I'd like it to go.
[226:01.42]I'd like it to fill my brain with nutrients.
[226:03.82]That would be great.
[226:18.31]So I think there's one more?
[226:21.95]Two more DLC levels?
[226:23.41]I think we're almost done.
[226:36.47]Do I chew on the sardine eyes?
[226:41.23]No, I get skinless, boneless sardines.
[226:44.99]I don't get full ID to... no.
[226:48.82]What the hell?
[226:56.08]Enjoy the Mercury poisoning, and then they did the smiley chat person face.
[227:00.20]And then they said, I don't know, I'm just kidding.
[227:01.78]Is that the thing?
[227:04.30]The dangerous colony.
[227:10.44]Only babies get a boneless?
[227:11.60]No, only babies want to eat no bones.
[227:15.72]When they spread it over a piece of toast.
[227:17.72]If that makes me a baby, then, uh, boo-boo-ga-ga.
[227:50.56]Wowies, so many buildings.
[227:53.22]Alright, time to get started rolling in this strange place.
[227:55.98]Roll a Katamari this big.
[227:57.30]That's pretty huge.
[227:58.00]3,000 is not a joke.
[228:01.46]Lots of dangerous stuff.
[228:06.54]Alright, I gotta get 3,000.
[228:11.76]Pick up dangerous things.
[228:15.01]Once I get to a big enough height.
[228:41.41]Dinosaurs are dangerous.
[228:47.81]I have like seven minutes to get there.
[228:49.45]That's probably not too hard.
[229:04.82]Dance.
[229:06.50]Dance, dance.
[229:12.04]There I go, just not even looking at the game.
[229:15.79]I was reading about Mercury.
[229:18.47]What's wrong with you?
[229:29.68]Bad.
[229:30.70]Bad.
[229:31.00]You're bad.
[229:32.22]I'm not even bad.
[229:33.94]I'm not bad.
[229:35.99]I was doing that in the pre-stream chat and I realized that not everybody was here yesterday
[230:01.63]I wrote, like, three or four times, like, stupid fucking dumb fucking thing, game's fucking stupid, and people are just like, are you alright?
[230:07.79]Is that a moving city?
[230:22.01]What is going on with this city?

[231:23.03]Yeah, Otto wants to leave the room.
[231:26.22]He's been in here the whole time and I didn't even show him.
[231:30.91]Do you want to go out?
[231:31.37]Do you want to leave the room?
[231:34.71]He's resting on a pillow.
[231:35.61]20... Auto or Riot?
[231:42.48]No, I'm not even dressed.
[231:44.02]No, I'm not dressed for the occasion.
[231:45.18]I'll be right back.
[231:47.44]Do you want to go out?
[231:47.92]What do you want to do?

[238:13.62]There's a big present over there.
[238:14.82]I'm gonna be close.
[238:20.20]I don't think I'm gonna do it, though.
[238:27.54]3,000 already!
[238:28.25]Wow!

[239:16.60]No longer a riot.
[239:17.92]8,000.
[239:26.65]Give you that king.
[239:34.77]Where's the king?
[239:35.53]Did I get him?
[239:42.05]No, I didn't get him.
[239:42.85]Where is he?
[239:44.79]Come here!
[239:46.82]Oh no!
[240:05.29]Oh well.
[240:15.11]Omega LOL.

[240:17.98]Omega LOL.
[240:20.96]Omega.
[240:21.62]Okay, so there's regular LOL, which is like laughing.
[240:27.70]That means you're laughing.
[240:29.64]So is omega LOL like you have hearts to laugh?
[240:41.65]Ultimate laughter.
[240:51.12]What the fuck do you think it is?
[240:55.04]Um... An emote that replaces the letter O. Because that's like 75% of its uses.
[241:20.13]True, Omegle.
[241:21.27]What is it?
[241:25.92]Wings.
[241:29.48]It's in the cake.
[241:31.42]And that's a... Wow.
[241:34.42]Drooby.
[241:35.62]Drooby, best cousin.
[241:39.26]Drooby with the giraffe head.
[241:55.46]That was barely worth it.
[241:58.02]Scorpius.
[242:03.35]If scorpions were bigger, would we be eating them like lobsters?
[242:08.79]Because that's what they are.
[242:21.82]We eat them already.
[242:23.40]We do?
[242:28.12]I think that's it.
[242:29.58]Is there any more?
[242:30.20]I think there's one more DLC level.
[242:33.48]It's one of the pods.
[242:39.34]Did I get them all?
[242:39.94]Did I do this one?
[242:44.92]That's the dangerous one I just did.
[242:46.36]Isn't there another one over here?
[242:54.35]I feel like there was another pod up here.
[242:55.59]I did this one.
[242:58.33]That's the constellations.
[243:01.57]Yeah, I did that.
[243:02.51]Did that.
[243:03.71]Did that.
[243:04.51]Up here.
[243:04.85]Did I do this pod?
[243:09.71]Mechanical.
[243:10.25]Yeah, I did.
[243:15.05]Game over.
[243:16.69]What?
[243:17.67]Not yet.
[243:18.89]Not yet.
[243:29.79]Let's see what the collection is.
[243:34.03]Is it over 100%?
[243:35.65]79%?
[243:35.69]How?
[243:38.99]I beat the damn game.
[243:42.25]I wanna... Where's the new, um... Wait!
[243:44.54]The dance party.
[243:45.10]That's how we get him over here.
[244:11.42]I'm not doing it right.
[244:12.40]Oh, you have to get 100% on every level I see.
[244:19.96]Are you?
[244:25.69]Yep.
[244:27.05]Alright, wait, I need to look at the other costumes.
[244:36.79]Kind of cool.
[244:38.59]Kind of cool.
[244:39.21]Hold on.
[244:43.08]Flowers, cool too.
[244:43.98]Mmm.
[244:53.32]Cool.
[244:54.56]And the wings?
[244:55.96]Should I do the wings?
[244:57.46]They're not that big.
[244:58.20]I wish they were bigger.
[244:58.92]Nah, I want the drill to be prominent.
[245:10.82]I think the backpack is just the best.
[245:13.78]Man, it works.
[245:14.68]Okay, yeah.
[245:23.45]Well, that's it for Katamari.
[245:25.55]I did it.
[245:27.43]I beat it.
[245:27.79]I did all seven DLC levels, right?
[245:37.85]Do a condiment tier list.
[245:39.03]Is that what you guys really want?
[245:39.93]I've already done it.
[245:41.77]You guys want condiment tier list?
[245:47.88]Oh, that's right.
[245:48.52]Read to the yarn level.
[245:49.38]Thank you so much.
[245:51.58]How could I have forgotten that?
[245:58.55]Where was it?
[246:08.67]Lover's Loom.
[246:09.81]Thank you!
[246:12.81]Did I do Munchy's Manor?
[246:13.96]Yep.
[246:26.24]I have to do this one one more time.
[246:29.10]And then I'll do Condiment Tier List.
[246:40.35]I wonder how it differs from when I did it already.
[246:42.65]Did I?
[246:44.51]What if it's all completely different?
[246:55.25]Normal?
[246:55.61]Just normal.
[247:02.23]Joel's movie.
[247:02.87]No, I'm not gonna watch Joel's movie.
[247:08.74]I'm not gonna watch a movie.
[247:10.90]No.
[247:11.84]I will some other day.
[247:14.12]That's 30 minutes.
[247:15.72]I don't get that kind of time.
[247:25.26]Don't distract me from my favorite level!
[247:36.64]You've already distracted me from my favorite level.
[247:39.78]And for this, I cannot forgive you.
[247:43.50]I've been distracted.
[247:44.20]Let's do it again.
[247:47.08]You spent two hours on one level.
[247:53.21]I don't have time.
[248:05.72]No, we're going to do a video watching stream anyways pretty soon.
[248:20.70]I'm not doing it tomorrow.
[248:22.70]No, I want to watch like a movie on Twitch.
[248:25.51]I want to watch like a public domain movie.
[248:28.63]And I guarantee I'm going to get sick of that real quick.
[248:30.67]So we can watch that movie there.
[248:39.24]Oh, also, while there's people here, let's talk about this.
[248:41.80]So remember, if you were in this pre-stream chat.
[248:45.52]No, if you were in the post-stream chat.
[248:47.52]We talked about this extensively.
[248:50.19]Yesterday we talked about stream.
[248:52.87]That's going to happen at some point.
[248:54.55]We're throwing ideas around.
[248:56.94]Of Salt and Jerma.
[249:00.20]Where I get servers over the course of a few different games.
[249:06.10]And I'm going to try to have as many people as humanly possible in these servers.
[249:11.55]Let's say, for instance, it's a Minecraft server.
[249:13.75]Or a Conan Exiles server.
[249:17.51]And the whole goal is I'm the king.
[249:21.07]And you have to do everything for me.
[249:24.79]And if I die, the stream ends.
[249:36.78]There are at least three or four games that I want to do this with.
[249:42.28]I'm gonna- and what- not just that.
[249:44.24]That's just one piece of this.
[249:45.54]I also want to set up, like, a king's court.
[249:48.44]Where people come and, like, share their grievances with the king.
[249:52.21]Like, we'll make, like, a castle and shit, and they'll- I'll have, like, king's guard, and you can come ask questions, and there'll be executions and shit.
[250:06.42]I'm not gonna die in four seconds because I'm gonna have a loyal Kingsguard.
[250:10.79]There's gonna be like 20 people whose only job is to make sure that they're like in like the gold armor to make it so I don't die.
[250:32.00]Me and uh, me and cad were actually talking about random stuff and like imagine a scenario where we play Minecraft And it's like Bring me 50 gold bar gold boxes and make a statue of me or I execute five people I was like, holy shit.
[250:56.40]That's fucking funny
[251:05.01]And now imagine there's 500 people in that server.
[251:10.33]I want to collect taxes.
[251:13.07]I want to go door-to-door with my, like, Kingsguard and collect taxes and shit.
[251:17.30]And if you try to kill me, or you better, you better make it for real.
[251:20.92]You better conspire with... I'm coming to collect taxes.
[251:28.14]You fuck up an assassination attempt, you're getting fed to the lions.
[251:31.67]Which is like a 12-foot dug hole with aggressive wolves in it.
[251:46.82]No lions?
[251:47.38]Are there lions in Minecraft?
[251:52.96]Oh, I did it.
[251:53.28]Cool.
[251:53.42]That was fun.
[251:55.53]But not just something like Minecraft, but going to like... Here's the thing though, like Conan Exiles, I think you can only have like 50 people in a server.
[252:02.66]Why don't I just get disconnected?
[252:07.53]So it would have to be, we would have to whitelist people, and maybe you'd have to, like, put an application in as to why you should be in the town.
[252:14.79]And, I also want to set up a thing where if we have a scenario like that, oh, you can only have 50 people in that server.
[252:21.15]People are just gonna sit there, and they're gonna turtle, they're not gonna, they're just gonna, the same person's gonna be there for, like, the entire, like, three or four, by the way, the idea is that if I'm alive, we keep going, and the town progresses.
[252:38.63]But, um, there'll be age.
[252:41.45]So, it'll be like one minute is like five to ten days.
[252:45.96]And if you get to be like sixty years old, you die of old age.
[252:49.36]So there's no, you know, we're always cycling through people.
[253:01.81]Does the king age?
[253:03.39]Yep.
[253:04.97]But I'll age a little slower, so I might just die of old age one day on stream.
[253:15.65]I just die of old age.
[253:16.79]I'm gonna be a good king though.
[253:20.65]What game am I thinking about doing this in?
[253:25.23]Minecraft is probably the easiest one to do it in.
[253:28.44]There's also Rust.
[253:30.24]There's also Conan Exiles.
[253:32.34]There's Ark.
[253:33.88]I'm thinking of any one of those games that came out where it was just an open environment where you're supposed to build a castle or build a thing with a bunch of people on the same server.
[253:48.87]Reign of Kings?
[253:49.55]There's a lot of them, and we could- it could- I want to make it a series.
[253:58.96]But from game to game, and scenario to scenario, for instance, we talked about, like, I don't do anything.
[254:06.79]It was gonna be WoW Classic, where I was- I was not going to play the game.
[254:11.03]And if I had to exert any force, then I would turn the stream off.
[254:15.33]That was the joke we were talking about last night.
[254:21.37]And I was like, do people want to actually watch me do that shit?
[254:26.59]We still could do that.
[254:27.85]I don't know.
[254:30.93]But imagine a scenario where there's, like, a bunch of tunnels that I can, like, escape in in Minecraft.
[254:37.18]There's, like, an angry mob outside coming in with bows and arrows.
[254:40.62]There's, like, 30 of you that have all, like, conspired that you're ready to go.
[254:43.48]Today's the day you're gonna go for the king.
[254:45.40]Oh, better make it up to this.
[254:47.16]15 tunnels I'm gonna go through.
[254:48.58]Good luck.
[255:00.09]I want it to be like a living ecosystem for at least a few days.
[255:05.10]I don't know.
[255:08.06]I might die instantly, but I think it's worth doing.
[255:11.54]I want to put like a bunch of like time and resources into it.
[255:14.28]I feel like it'd be really funny and really fun.
[255:22.34]Someone's gonna shoot you in the head with an enchanted bow.
[255:30.27]Not if I... Not if I... Look, you gotta start from zero.
[255:37.65]It's gonna be not easy.
[255:41.31]I'm gonna mod those servers.
[255:42.85]You're gonna have age.
[255:54.06]They'll be on your team.
[255:56.84]We'll see.
[256:00.41]Your bodyguards will just be shields.
[256:02.41]Well, the theory is that to make it so I don't die in the first 10 seconds, there's a, you know, town hall, and there's a castle, and I have a room in the castle, and all my loyal servants have rooms in the castle, and there's like 25 people in that castle that I can ring the bell if somebody's climbing in my window with a fucking axe.
[256:23.01]And I can defend myself, too.
[256:29.13]By the way, if you die... That's it.
[256:34.32]You're out.
[256:35.26]Someone else is gonna take your place.
[256:38.24]As a baby.
[256:51.25]We'll just swarm you.
[256:52.97]But will you though?
[256:56.47]This is where it gets interesting because...
[256:59.72]I'm not going to be like a bad king.
[257:01.22]I want the town to be sufficient and be moving forward.
[257:07.95]There's going to be lots of loyal people that are in this town.
[257:13.43]What, you think that they're just going to try to kill me?
[257:18.44]We're going to have trials.
[257:19.86]There'll be trials by combat.
[257:21.16]If you do something wrong, if you get arrested...
[257:25.15]Or if you try to kill me or something, and I'm feeling a little generous today.
[257:30.12]The two people that tried to kill me, that were working together in their own little private Discord, you two have to fight to death, and whoever dies, see you later.
[257:52.02]Is the server gonna be hardcore?
[257:53.54]I'm not sure yet, but... I want to do this a few times over a couple different games.
[258:00.42]So, this is all very preliminary.
[258:03.88]But it's doing it for me.
[258:04.80]And you know, when there's an idea that does it for me... It happens.
[258:09.24]It's just gonna happen.
[258:10.58]I'm gonna put a bunch of time, and I'm gonna put some money into it, too.
[258:13.83]See if we can get some, like, coded server shit that... You know, we can have aging in the servers, and you just get deleted and you die.
[258:23.78]Should be fun.
[258:25.86]But there are a couple different ways to play it.
[258:28.52]We can do them as many ways as we want.
[258:36.96]What game?
[258:38.12]That hasn't been decided yet.
[258:39.10]It'll be probably like Minecraft, Rust, Reign of Kings, Ark, Conan Exiles.
[258:43.76]Something where we can just openly just sort of RP in on our own terms with our own rules in the server.
[258:51.62]I want to see how long I last.
[258:52.84]I want to see if I have any loyal people that will protect me.
[258:59.39]Make it a weekly event.
[259:00.37]That's the idea.
[259:05.23]The original title of the stream was going to be Lazy Fuck.
[259:08.54]Because I didn't do anything.
[259:10.28]I just stood around.
[259:11.86]Well, everyone did everything for me.
[259:13.36]And money was poured into my character's account and stuff.
[259:28.04]Ego maniac.
[259:31.75]Alright, let's move on.
[259:32.61]I'm gonna do my tier list.
[259:38.73]Hey, ball rolling DLC is actually done.
[259:40.49]Alright, give me a condiment tier list.
[259:42.33]Let's see one.
[259:42.77]Give it to me.
[259:48.76]It's the spy statue bit.
[259:50.36]It's the spy statue bit, but with actual rules and potentially hundreds of people participating, not just like three.
[260:02.01]So it's a kind of an evolution of that.
[260:04.43]Alright, tier maker, checks mix.
[260:09.81]Nope, not clicking that one.
[260:11.01]US president's not clicking that one.
[260:13.49]Is there even, where's the condiment tier list?
[260:15.93]Let me see it.
[260:16.33]Okay.
[260:20.16]This one sucks.
[260:21.02]Butter is on here.
[260:21.92]Who uses butter as a condiment?
[260:26.90]Butter?
[260:28.38]That's not a condiment.
[260:29.14]It's like an ingredient.
[260:32.42]You guys think it was gross when I said mayo and fries?
[260:34.66]Butter as a condiment.
[260:38.34]On vegetables?
[260:39.46]Yeah, but that's like... No, no, no, no, no.
[260:41.72]That's like part of the recipe.
[260:43.10]You don't just like... You guys add a bunch of butter on your vegetables?
[260:52.99]Are eggs a condiment too?
[260:54.21]Ah, fuck.
[261:02.83]God damn it, that hurt.
[261:03.89]Okay.
[261:05.81]This one, better one.
[261:07.11]Something better than this.
[261:18.44]Did you eat a toenail?
[261:21.94]Let me look it up.
[261:22.48]I'll just look it up.
[261:25.05]World of Warcraft expansions.
[261:27.93]Condiments and sauces.
[261:29.07]This looks like the one.
[261:33.13]Okay, here we go.
[261:34.77]This one looks a little better.
[261:35.61]Let me get out of this game.
[261:38.85]Just give me one second while I do this.
[261:43.19]That was Katamari.
[261:45.91]It was a lot of fun.
[261:47.65]These games are wonderful.
[261:51.73]That's how you know I have a real Xbox, because you just heard that noise.
[261:54.45]I didn't make that with my mouth.
[261:57.97]Fine, I'll do the World of Warcraft.
[261:58.93]Okay, I'll do the expansions one, too.
[262:02.83]I could do this with my eyes closed.
[262:11.34]Why do I even need to do this on camera?
[262:13.60]I could just say it.
[262:15.28]There's six of them.
