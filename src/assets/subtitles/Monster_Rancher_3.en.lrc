[00:45.20]Hello.
[00:48.30]How you doing?
[00:51.03]You might know me as... J.J.
[00:54.99]Abram.
[00:58.01]How are you?
[00:58.29]Hope you're all having a swell day.
[01:04.71]I am.
[01:04.99]I mean, you could always be better, right?
[01:09.41]But, you know, you could always be worse, too.
[01:13.18]Give me one minute, I'm gonna make a tweet.
[01:15.05]See you in two seconds.
[01:59.00]Okay.
[02:00.60]So tonight, we're going to be playing Monster Rancher 3.
[02:03.44]For a little while.
[02:09.48]Uh... I said... I really... Why the fuck... You know, I say this every time.
[02:16.41]But I'm not even kidding.
[02:18.63]Every time I start a stream and I try to make a tweet, it won't let me.
[02:22.97]Like, Comcast is blocking me from writing a tweet.
[02:26.71]Because I just turned on a stream.
[02:29.16]It's like, wait, hold on a second.
[02:30.48]You can't do that.
[02:32.52]You literally just started using internet somewhere else.
[02:35.48]You're not allowed to use it anywhere fucking else in the whole world.
[02:39.91]I just get failed to send every time.
[02:42.23]I can't wait to be gone from here.
[02:45.51]Viva Las Vegas, baby.
[02:46.77]That's all I gotta say.
[02:50.37]Like, it happens every single fucking time.
[02:52.11]Without fail, every single time I try to, like, make a tweet.
[02:57.10]After I press the stream button.
[02:59.28]For the last, like, four months.
[03:04.24]Anyways, I kind of already had the intro playing here.
[03:09.85]I'll try one more time, and then I'm gonna have to do it later.
[03:11.73]Unfortunately, let me just chill for a moment.
[03:22.19]It's almost like Twitter flags my account.
[03:25.53]Because it knows that I'm like trying to tell people I'm streaming.
[03:29.47]And then just fuck it with me.
[03:33.17]Nah, it ain't gonna work.
[03:34.65]Like, I'll fucking have to do it like in an hour or something.
[03:36.73]Like, give me a break.
[03:38.41]Anyways, hey look, it's Monster Rancher 3!
[03:40.43]And I'm Jeremy.
[03:42.11]This is the newest iteration.
[03:44.31]You know, Monster Rancher 1, 2, and now 3.
[03:47.27]This game looks pretty confusing.
[03:52.25]I'll tell you for one reason, because they've changed the names of everything.
[03:56.91]It's no longer freezing, it's hibernation, it's no longer... There's like two or three name changes that are going to have to take a little while to get used to.
[04:04.84]Am I not at PAX?
[04:07.54]No, I'll talk about PAX.
[04:09.94]PAX is tomorrow.
[04:12.21]And I'm going to be doing a meetup at PAX.
[04:19.38]On Saturday.
[04:20.72]But let's wait until more people can hang out and trickle in.
[04:23.28]I'll talk more about it later.
[04:27.28]But write your name here.
[04:29.10]Let's get our name written down.
[04:32.54]Let's go with something fun, you know?
[04:38.49]No, no, no.
[04:39.31]Wait.
[04:41.83]How about Jared?
[04:44.83]Yeah, Jared.
[04:47.93]Jared.
[04:50.71]jared fun streamer the music the music is still un-bearable but that you know that's that's the way it is jared jared me how about that how about jared me jargon
[05:20.15]How about just Jeremy?
[05:21.15]I don't like it.
[05:23.85]Jeremy!
[05:26.35]Uh, mail?
[05:27.42]Is this okay?
[05:28.30]Yes, it is.
[05:31.58]Oh, Jeremy, a breeder, huh?
[05:33.10]I'm so sorry.
[05:33.90]I can't revive any monsters right now.
[05:35.64]My schedule is full.
[05:36.58]Try again later.
[05:39.05]Did I lose?
[05:39.57]This is not connected to the internet.
[05:42.53]Here's our friend.
[05:45.14]Hi, I'm Flarea.
[05:47.20]It looks like you wanted to be a breeder, but couldn't revive a monster.
[05:50.86]I mean, I have the PlayStation 1 memory card not work.
[05:56.35]Because I have the PS1 memory card plugged in right now.
[06:00.69]We should be able to bring somebody back, right?
[06:05.32]What do you think?
[06:08.38]His name is as dumb as yours.
[06:09.80]What's wrong with my name?
[06:12.99]So I can't... I got the memory card plugged in.
[06:18.97]No, I want to... Liar, I was watching you.
[06:21.83]Grandpa Bragma told you he couldn't revive a monster for you.
[06:26.79]So I have an idea.
[06:27.65]Why don't we both go back and ask him again?
[06:29.83]He'll do it if you're with me.
[06:31.79]Why?
[06:32.11]Because I'm a Tochi-Kan.
[06:34.55]The Reviver is also a Tochi-Kan.
[06:36.41]It's a good plan.
[06:38.25]But when we go see Grandpa Bragma...
[06:40.71]You have to say that you're my apprentice.
[06:42.34]Do you have a problem with that?
[06:44.16]Actually, they won't listen to us unless you say you're with me.
[06:47.86]Well, let's go and get a monster.
[06:49.82]Okay.
[06:53.66]You again.
[06:54.10]I told you I can't revive any monsters.
[06:57.02]Oh, don't be so hard-headed, Grandpa Bragma.
[07:00.28]What are you doing here?
[07:02.00]Why am I here?
[07:02.58]Because Jeremy is my apprentice.
[07:05.32]Apprentice?
[07:05.78]You're kidding.
[07:06.58]You're just saying that, aren't you?
[07:08.65]No way!
[07:09.93]So, Grandpa Bragma, just cheat a little and revive one.
[07:15.11]No.
[07:15.67]I can't change the reservation order.
[07:19.82]What?
[07:20.32]What happened to my power?
[07:21.96]Of authority as a master?
[07:24.14]I don't care.
[07:25.66]Grandpa Bragma.
[07:26.68]What's on her neck?
[07:27.80]Why does she have Mad-Eye Moody's necklace on?
[07:32.90]I'm going to tell everybody about the letters you wrote to that woman a long time ago.
[07:36.48]Am I blackmailing this guy?
[07:40.93]I'll revive a monster, but I'll have to tell people it was because Flaria asked me to.
[07:45.59]The owner of the monster will actually be Flaria.
[07:47.57]That's fine, hurry up.
[07:51.03]Alright, let me prepare the revival.
[07:54.54]Which method do you want to revive?
[07:55.72]Alright, what about, um, just Saucer Stone?
[07:59.58]Do you want to revive one from a Saucer Stone?
[08:02.76]Is that a memory card?
[08:04.58]I will open the disk tray.
[08:05.78]Ready?
[08:06.56]No.
[08:06.78]Okay, Saucer Stone.
[08:08.29]What about Encyclopedia?
[08:10.56]Now then, choose the page of the monster you wish to revive.
[08:15.86]No, I actually can't do it.
[08:20.61]Harry Potter and the Saucer Stone.
[08:24.21]Oh, you want to stop?
[08:25.05]No way.
[08:25.39]No, no, no, no, no.
[08:26.01]We already cut in line.
[08:26.79]Hurry up and revive.
[08:27.41]Okay, we have to put a disk in.
[08:30.55]Will he actually open the disk tray?
[08:33.51]Actually, I want to see if this works.
[08:35.09]Hold on a minute.
[08:38.11]Oh, and by the way,
[08:41.39]What do you think about that one?
[08:42.89]Smooth?
[08:44.05]Tight on the sides?
[08:46.41]Hmm?
[08:48.08]Didn't think I was gonna get a haircut right before PAX, did ya?
[08:50.50]Oh, wait.
[08:52.28]Here we go.
[08:56.00]Shaved, too?
[08:56.90]I got a nice shave?
[09:00.50]Uh, anyways.
[09:01.57]Let's see if he actually opens it.
[09:02.63]Let's see.
[09:07.85]Yeah.
[09:11.23]Okay.
[09:12.11]Would you like me to open the disk tray?
[09:13.51]I sure would like you to perform a magic trick.
[09:19.00]Here we go.
[09:20.46]I will open the disk tray.
[09:21.66]I'm ready.
[09:25.68]Please.
[09:26.17]Oh, come on.
[09:27.59]Why did I think that was going to happen?
[09:32.85]He has to...
[09:35.63]that I think was gonna happen seriously dude uh alright so we got we can do dvds now if you didn't know we actually can do dvds right this is not the right place okay so uh we're gonna start with Shanghai noon because that's obviously like the first one I want to use this guy has his full name written on this disk
[10:06.38]Like, he did it in permanent marker, so hold on here.
[10:10.18]I'm not gonna show the guy's whole name, but, like, look.
[10:16.11]Thank you, Scott, for your copy of Shanghai Noon.
[10:18.49]Let's open it up.
[10:24.07]Press the X button.
[10:24.83]Let's see what we get from DVD number one.
[10:28.73]And then let me try to, like, tweet while this is happening.
[10:31.87]This feels very sensitive.
[10:33.51]I don't like this.
[10:34.41]This feels too sensitive.
[10:38.36]You know what I'm saying?
[10:38.98]Like, I have like the little skinny thin version of the PS2.
[10:42.64]I'm actually kind of scared this is going to fuck up.
[10:44.36]I'm going to break this at some point during the course of the next few days.
[10:47.82]Well, a few days have been like a month.
[10:50.50]Okay, let's do it again.
[10:51.30]Press the X button.
[10:54.09]Opening disk tray.
[10:54.83]Press the X button to confirm.
[10:58.07]Okay, I think that just means it's... You're allowed to.
[11:00.73]It's very fragile, though.
[11:03.73]I'm definitely going to break this.
[11:08.11]Alright, let's see what we get from Shanghai Noon.
[11:17.50]Here we go.
[11:18.64]Moment of truth.
[11:21.48]That sounds like electricity to anybody?
[11:22.74]That sounds like electricity.
[11:29.18]Let's get a nice good squig of blood.
[11:34.54]Behold the monster.
[11:46.04]From the heavens.
[11:49.98]This is a much more elaborate animation than the last two games.
[11:58.67]It's already... What is that thing?
[12:03.71]What a pretty monster.
[12:05.61]It looks like this is the first monster of its kind that you have captured.
[12:08.87]Here's a present for you.
[12:10.41]It's a new page in the encyclopedia.
[12:19.97]I can't even tell you what this is.
[12:21.79]When the wind blows, its beautiful song can be heard.
[12:23.89]The melody makes you sleepy and sometimes you get lost.
[12:29.10]Okay, he's got pretty good life, pretty good intelligence.
[12:34.36]Characteristics.
[12:35.02]Quiet, chlorophyll, and clean.
[12:38.38]Moves stab and slap.
[12:42.40]That's 115, 128.
[12:42.60]That's not bad.
[12:46.55]You don't like it?
[12:50.28]It's an umbrella.
[12:52.40]No, it's a dreamcatcher.
[12:59.12]I'm going to hold on to this guy.
[13:00.88]Will you take this monster home with you?
[13:02.72]Yes.
[13:04.46]Don't worry, we've got plenty.
[13:05.32]We can stab and slap.
[13:06.71]And we'll get him an intelligence name.
[13:08.13]Alright, how about... He looks like the inside of a blender.
[13:15.63]So, what do you think?
[13:18.41]Like, if you turned him upside down.
[13:19.37]Like, you know those emulsion blenders?
[13:21.01]How about, like, Blendo?
[13:23.02]Oh, that's too easy.
[13:26.56]Bland... Blandy?
[13:28.93]Bland?
[13:29.79]Blandy?
[13:32.31]Scott.
[13:47.96]Am I actually fucking doing this?
[13:54.31]H. Scott.
[13:55.79]This guy's name from... I don't like that.
[14:15.42]Let's go do our best to raise H. Scott.
[14:23.42]He's got his full name on here, man.
[14:26.28]First Monster.
[14:27.08]Jeremy, you must first train to win.
[14:28.82]Get that fucking facecam off.
[14:31.20]And let me tweet now.
[14:34.42]You must first train, except he was life and intelligence.
[14:36.70]Let's focus on a little bit of defense probably, I would say.
[14:38.93]Hold on a second.
[14:46.47]I have like a selfie of me with this new haircut.
[14:52.33]God I like look at it like good thing.
[14:54.09]Nobody could like see that That looks embarrassing.
[14:57.99]I have like 15 zoomed in pictures of my face.
[15:00.75]Alright, let's see Can the Comcast can I please make a tweet Monster Rancher 3 I
[15:19.19]I wish I named him fuckin' B, like, Blendscott or something.
[15:24.51]I don't like this name.
[15:28.87]No, I still can't.
[15:30.01]Sorry, we're unable to send your tweet.
[15:31.67]Would you like to retry it?
[15:34.31]What are you doing?
[15:36.61]Why can't I do this?
[15:38.77]I don't understand.
[15:41.30]It doesn't make any sense.
[15:43.68]I'm gonna just write the word fuckin' puke and see if it goes through.
[15:50.20]Maybe Twitter won't let me post links.
[15:52.62]What the fuck?
[15:56.00]Higher rank tournaments.
[15:56.88]The top rank is S. You've done very well.
[16:00.78]If you can get there, good luck.
[16:02.80]Grandpa Bragma, Jeremy is my apprentice.
[16:04.60]It won't take long to get there.
[16:10.31]Let me tell you something.
[16:12.91]Okay.
[16:14.65]Well, H. Scott is technically mine.
[16:16.71]I told you that we trained this monster together.
[16:18.55]Why did I do that?
[16:21.50]So we'll both work to train H. Scott, okay?
[16:23.72]No, no, no, this is mine.
[16:26.57]I own fucking Shanghai Noon.
[16:29.03]It was gifted to me by H. Scott.
[16:32.79]So sorry.
[16:34.25]Fine, then I'll go return this monster to Grandpa Bragma.
[16:37.09]You don't want that now, do you?
[16:38.91]After all, I am a Tochikan child.
[16:41.59]I know about raising monsters, and I have many connections.
[16:45.37]I can give you advice on training.
[16:47.61]You'll find no greater master for a newbie like you.
[16:49.83]Let's get going.
[16:50.59]Okay, now that we have a monster, that ended very easily.
[16:55.35]We have to find a place to train the monster.
[16:59.47]Yeah, that's it, huh?
[17:00.27]Grandpa, why do you... That's a long walk that he's doing from here to there.
[17:04.71]I was listening in from up on the fucking Sky Palace.
[17:07.83]I knew that you'd force Jeremy to be your apprentice.
[17:10.59]So I walked eight miles down the stairway to heaven.
[17:16.28]Well, well, that's just a small detail.
[17:18.27]Jeremy, let's train the monster at Mork's first.
[17:21.95]It's an easy place to live, and I know the area well.
[17:25.15]That's a good idea.
[17:26.95]I'll talk to Mork's and get permission to train there.
[17:30.00]Thanks, Grandpa.
[17:31.22]Jeremy, Flaria seems to like you a lot.
[17:34.00]I know she can be annoying, but she can be helpful too.
[17:36.56]Please get along with her.
[17:39.14]That's great.
[17:40.36]Let's hurry and move.
[17:43.89]So what are you going to do?
[17:46.64]Move.
[17:48.44]Should we try another disk?
[17:49.38]What do you guys think?
[17:52.22]Should we take H. Scott for a ride or should we put another DVD in?
[18:01.62]What do you guys think?
[18:02.12]Maybe we'll try to get a couple more just to see what we can get.
[18:04.28]Try a few more discs.
[18:10.61]I'm trying to- I'm so desperately trying to tweet and stream at the same time.
[18:17.07]Okay, let me- come on.
[18:17.89]Okay, I got it.
[18:21.71]I got it.
[18:21.99]It worked.
[18:24.11]I'm trying to buy so much time.
[18:25.61]Alright, uh, hibernate, right?
[18:31.86]Uh, put to sleep.
[18:34.12]You want to have H. Scott hibernate.
[18:35.96]Yes.
[18:36.98]I'll let it sti- but does that mean it's- what does that mean?
[18:40.41]No, okay.
[18:40.83]It's exactly what I think it is.
[18:45.53]Alright.
[18:46.68]Back it up.
[18:47.34]Let's, uh... Peace split regenerate.
[18:51.68]With a saucer stone.
[18:54.04]Want a revival from a saucer stone.
[18:55.50]Yes, I do.
[18:56.18]In this one, we're gonna do... Uh, this one.
[19:00.64]Open the tray.
[19:01.20]Hold on.
[19:01.54]We're gonna get our reaction cam on.
[19:03.36]Just in case there's a fucking cool reaction to have.
[19:05.50]You know what I'm saying?
[19:07.64]Uh, please insert a DVD into the CD-DVD tray.
[19:15.08]uh this one this is gremlins gremlins the original gremlins one of the greatest movies ever I wonder if we're gonna get a gremlin uh press x checking the disk
[19:45.70]Mm-hmm.
[19:49.98]Opening disk tray.
[19:50.94]Press the button to confirm it.
[19:52.32]Ooh, don't bump the mic, though.
[19:53.55]Don't do that.
[19:55.51]Cause a problem for all the people watching.
[20:02.03]Montreux Rancho 3 going in.
[20:04.86]Let's go.
[20:08.86]I really don't like the way that sounds.
[20:13.53]I got a broken PS3.
[20:15.23]PS2.
[20:16.21]It's a PS2, right?
[20:16.59]Yeah.
[20:16.75]Alright, here we go.
[20:33.46]What's it gonna be?
[20:34.92]What's it gonna be?
[20:38.10]Get ready to scream.
[20:39.80]As loud as I can into the microphone.
[20:52.60]What the fuck is that thing?
[20:55.06]Looks like this is the first monster of its kind.
[20:57.36]You have captured.
[20:58.10]Here's a present for you.
[21:02.64]Tort Boy!
[21:03.64]It's a Tort Boy!
[21:05.66]This is the most relaxed of all mews, and because of this, many want it as a pet.
[21:10.24]It can move surprisingly fast sometimes, though.
[21:14.77]Ooh.
[21:16.51]This is good.
[21:18.77]Boozy's got a head and then Poco Punch, and he's very relaxed.
[21:25.65]Okay.
[21:27.17]That's a lot of defense, and that's a lot of good base power.
[21:29.70]Let's hold on to this one, too.
[21:32.80]Hmm.
[21:37.32]Yes, I want to take this monster home.
[21:43.11]I mean, he's got... We can't name him Tort Boy.
[21:46.99]Gizmo.
[21:47.75]But he doesn't look like Gizmo.
[21:48.67]He doesn't have the same fur.
[21:52.10]It's a knock-off Jigglypuff.
[21:58.70]Turt Boy.
[21:59.62]Turt Boy already is the default name.
[22:01.64]It's got to be something else.
[22:04.30]Pop-Tart?
[22:05.50]Pop-Tart's not bad.
[22:06.38]I like Pop-Tart.
[22:10.62]Bald Gizmo.
[22:11.60]No.
[22:11.90]Pop-Tart.
[22:12.62]Pop-Tort.
[22:13.24]Pop-Tort.
[22:13.86]Got it.
[22:15.24]Pop-Tort.
[22:22.66]Pop Turd.
[22:24.40]Pop Turd.
[22:27.98]Yeah, Pop Turd.
[22:31.98]Pop Turd.
[22:33.28]No, it's not... Turtle, not Turd.
[22:35.55]Turtle.
[22:37.27]Pop Turd.
[22:41.05]Pop Turtle.
[22:42.01]No, just Pop Turd.
[22:42.99]It's fine.
[22:46.33]So we're gonna go to name it Pop Turd.
[22:47.89]Mm-hmm.
[22:53.15]tort no turt for turtle pop turt pop tort pop turt uh hibernate let's do another one I mean let's do like three four in a row put him to sleep and I think I kind of want to use pop turt eventually here when we get going put it to sleep we got uh meet the fokkers should I do should we do meet the fokkers next or veggie tails
[23:21.84]I think we have to do VeggieTales.
[23:23.52]That's pretty important, I think.
[23:28.83]Yeah.
[23:30.01]VeggieTales and Easter Carol.
[23:31.77]I should have streamed this on Easter and made this.
[23:34.71]I should have done that.
[23:37.23]Oh, well.
[23:38.81]Hibernate.
[23:39.65]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:40.41]Hibernate.
[23:41.07]Regenerate.
[23:43.09]Saucer Stone.
[23:43.67]We'll do this one and we'll see what we got.
[23:48.83]And here we go.
[23:50.53]Mm-hmm.
[23:55.59]This is on the PlayStation 2, by the way, if you were curious.
[24:04.15]I was a little rough with that one.
[24:11.27]Did I get a haircut?
[24:11.89]Yeah, I did.
[24:13.07]I had to get a haircut before PAX, so people wouldn't be able to make fun of me in real life.
[24:17.30]It's one thing to get made fun of on the internet, but people make fun of you in real life.
[24:21.30]That's when you've got to be careful.
[24:24.34]Technically still Easter.
[24:27.98]Is it?
[24:28.40]No, it's not.
[24:28.78]What?
[24:29.16]It's not technically still Easter.
[24:32.84]It hasn't been Easter for like four days.
[24:34.94]Alright, VeggieTales, what do you got?
[24:41.09]I hope it's a fucking cucumber.
[24:54.71]Easter lasts 50 days?
[25:00.35]What are you talking about?
[25:03.71]Jesus isn't born 50 days in a row?
[25:07.06]Jesus isn't, like, there's like 50 Jesuses?
[25:09.84]Jesus is born on April, uh, on Easter.
[25:14.10]He was born on Easter.
[25:16.22]And then every day for 40 days there's another Jesus?
[25:23.16]Please.
[25:25.76]And it is a VeggieTale.
[25:26.78]It's a fucking... I don't know what that is.
[25:30.61]It looks like this is the first monster of its kind.
[25:33.05]What is this thing?
[25:35.77]A gel.
[25:39.71]Merry Christmas, everybody.
[25:42.45]These gel creatures have avoided contact with humans and thus have not taken on a human shape.
[25:46.19]This is the true shape of a gel.
[25:51.30]That's actually really good.
[25:52.48]Gel Body, Whimsical, Wind Wisdom, Gel Charge, and Gel Sweep.
[25:57.50]That's a lot of Intelligence and Defense.
[26:01.98]Let's do one more.
[26:03.28]One final one.
[26:04.42]Take him.
[26:08.93]It's blue.
[26:11.89]Gel Turtle.
[26:12.71]It's not gonna be Gel Turtle, please!
[26:16.41]Gel Turtle.
[26:17.41]Don't even fucking make me write that, because it sucks so much.
[26:27.17]Yeah, what's that dumb character's name Scott jello No, it's gonna be uh Raindrop No, uh that he can't have a cool name
[26:55.71]That isn't even a cool name.
[26:56.72]Why am I assuming that that's a cool name?
[26:58.26]That's a terrible name.
[27:02.14]How about, like, Rain?
[27:07.60]Drop Top?
[27:08.86]I actually like Drop Top.
[27:15.11]Blue, Gum Sonic, Drop Top.
[27:17.61]Mm-hmm.
[27:19.35]Drop Top.
[27:21.99]Drop Turk.
[27:26.36]Droplet?
[27:28.22]Drop top?
[27:28.72]Droplet?
[27:29.55]Drop top?
[27:31.13]Tilapia?
[27:32.55]Tilapia.
[27:34.63]Yeah, I like drop top.
[27:40.91]Drop turd.
[27:43.75]Drop turd!
[27:48.82]Yeah, drop top.
[27:49.46]We're going with drop top.
[27:55.83]last one we're gonna do we'll get one more disk in here put them away hibernate put to sleep sleep with the fishes alright we gotta get the last one here is to be good not like a shitty Adam Sandler meme of course the dark knight now do we do wait a minute no no no hold on should I do the windows 7 installation cd
[28:23.07]No, we're doing the Dark Knight Rises widescreen edition.
[28:28.85]Yeah, the widescreen edition.
[28:30.66]There it is.
[28:35.98]Okay, back it up.
[28:39.60]Last one, then we're going to pick one.
[28:42.59]Regenerate.
[28:44.21]Saucer Stone.
[28:48.61]pirated windows you can't have a pirated windows if it's a legit copy that has the windows logo on it don't tell me I got a pirated copy of the windows logo that's not how it works if it says windows on it that means it's legitimate everything you see on TV and everything you read on the internet it has to be it has to be true otherwise it can't be on there you know it goes through oh fuck I didn't this is this is the monster wrench 3 disk
[29:16.65]Yeah, don't you guys know?
[29:17.33]Everything has to be true if it's on media.
[29:19.01]All media has to be vetted, you know what I mean?
[29:21.84]It has to be shown... Somebody has to make sure it's correct.
[29:27.82]No.
[29:32.92]I will open the disk tray.
[29:34.08]Ready?
[29:34.36]Yes.
[29:41.69]Have I done the Monster Rancher 1 or 2 discs?
[29:43.37]No, I haven't.
[29:46.02]We'll do that later.
[29:46.64]I want to start training somebody up.
[29:50.05]This can't just be a monster DNA stream.
[29:54.13]This has got to be at least a monster training and fighting stream for a little while.
[29:57.27]And then I do have to get ready for PAX.
[30:00.65]Now that we have enough people here, let me go over this.
[30:03.56]So, PAX.
[30:05.86]I'll be around PAX pretty much all weekend.
[30:09.54]But, I'm doing the official...
[30:13.64]Shake the hand and meet the guy.
[30:15.93]You know what I mean?
[30:16.43]I'm doing that on Saturday.
[30:18.17]Saturday at like 4 o'clock.
[30:19.95]Somewhere in the lobby.
[30:21.05]So if you're going to PAX East, Saturday at 4 o'clock I'll see you in the lobby.
[30:25.09]Just look at my, follow my Twitter.
[30:29.13]Because that's what I'm doing, like the official meet the hand and shake the guy.
[30:32.78]You know what I'm saying?
[30:35.04]The guy.
[30:36.22]Open this, open it, open it, open it.
[30:37.80]There we go.
[30:42.84]Who am I meeting?
[30:43.44]I don't know.
[30:43.74]Whoever the fuck wants to come say hello.
[30:46.88]Funny story.
[30:49.48]I don't have PAX tickets.
[30:52.29]So I'm actually going to go be the weirdo that doesn't have a ticket that just goes and hangs out in the lobby.
[30:59.59]Drinks coffee and just hangs out for like an hour.
[31:03.62]I don't have a badge to PAX.
[31:06.58]But I'm still going.
[31:22.65]I don't get in for free.
[31:24.20]That's not how it works.
[31:27.94]So we're gonna be in the... Gonna go be in the lobby.
[31:33.17]Gonna go into the lobby.
[31:34.65]Go into the lobby.
[31:35.37]The lobby system.
[31:36.45]We're gonna queue up in the lobby.
[31:38.91]And I wasn't giving you the finger, I promise.
[31:46.01]Okay, that's a weird monster.
[31:48.09]Was this... This is the Dark Knight?
[31:50.91]Looks like it's the first monster.
[31:52.15]It's, uh... That is, like, just the Joker.
[31:54.13]That's just the Joker.
[31:54.77]We're gonna have to call him the Joker.
[31:56.71]Spearmint.
[31:59.28]The twisty thing on its head is not hair, but a shell.
[32:01.32]It is so fashionable that it goes underwater to put on these stylish things.
[32:06.96]Mmm, Joker kinda sucks.
[32:10.32]He has my haircut right now?
[32:15.33]Sonic the Joker?
[32:17.03]Okay, I'm fine with that.
[32:19.60]But it's a rabbit.
[32:20.34]Rabbits suck.
[32:22.18]Nobody wants a rabbit.
[32:27.20]Delete the Joker?
[32:28.02]Nope.
[32:28.88]Mm-mm.
[32:29.28]It's gonna be Sonic the Joker.
[32:36.18]So, how, what can I fit here?
[32:37.44]The, the name, you, look at how short these names can be.
[32:41.83]What?
[32:42.49]I could have like a full name last time.
[32:51.82]Sonic joke?
[32:53.64]No.
[32:55.48]S to J?
[33:04.13]What's like a- what's like a Joker weapon or a Joker reference?
[33:07.07]I don't know any Joker references.
[33:10.83]Uh, how about like... Didn't he have like a poison flower that he shot up?
[33:15.31]But this guy's not poison.
[33:21.37]Old Material Sonic.
[33:22.77]Yeah.
[33:25.79]We are doing actual, like, fucking old material.
[33:30.85]How about just fucking... Gum Hair.
[33:33.41]How does that sound?
[33:36.62]Gum Hair sucks, and will never be used.
[33:41.36]Oh, that's perfect!
[33:42.26]Perfect!
[33:42.90]Look at this, Gum Hair spelled with H-A-R-E.
[33:45.12]Gum Hair.
[33:55.40]There it is.
[33:59.65]He's getting deleted immediately, don't worry.
[34:01.65]We're not using him.
[34:08.41]Alright.
[34:09.09]Hibernate.
[34:10.31]Let's take a monster out and do some training.
[34:13.10]See you later.
[34:16.20]Put him to sleep.
[34:19.64]So who are we bringing out?
[34:20.38]That's the question.
[34:21.14]Let's do a poll on who you guys want me to play with first.
[34:24.80]Of course, we always, like, take into consideration what the chat wants to see.
[34:28.67]Of course.
[34:29.77]Of course I do.
[34:32.41]So we got H. Scott, Pop-Turt, Drop-Top.
[34:34.87]They're all the same fucking name.
[34:39.83]These are all... It's like the seven dwarves.
[34:42.85]You know what I mean?
[34:43.45]H. Scott, Pop-Turt, Drop-Top.
[34:47.64]It's the same name for three different fucking monsters.
[34:49.60]Alright, anyways, here we go.
[34:51.46]H. Scott.
[34:55.71]pop h Scott pop turd dropped up or gum hair he sucks who are we gonna start with
[35:23.39]Looks like Pop-Turt and Drop-Top are close here.
[35:26.46]They're all close.
[35:28.10]No, they're not.
[35:28.66]Nobody wants to see H. Scott.
[35:35.98]Okay, well, it's too close to call between Drop-Top and Pop-Turt.
[35:42.63]Both very good base stats for a base monster here.
[35:50.59]Too close to call.
[35:52.27]Pop Turt and Drop Top.
[36:07.57]Pop Turt's pulling ahead.
[36:08.65]Nope.
[36:11.85]Fuse them together?
[36:14.46]We could do that.
[36:15.22]We could just fuse them together.
[36:16.48]That way I don't have any money.
[36:20.96]Peace?
[36:22.56]Sorry, but you don't seem to have four matching pieces.
[36:26.60]I don't think we can even... Can we even do that in this game?
[36:33.77]Fuse.
[36:34.27]Fuse them.
[36:35.13]How do I fuse them?
[36:36.07]Split?
[36:37.29]You don't have any monsters to part with.
[36:38.65]Regenerate.
[36:41.91]Saucer?
[36:42.97]I don't think I can do this.
[36:51.31]System?
[36:53.76]No.
[36:54.16]I will save it, though.
[36:59.73]It's still too close to call.
[37:03.18]Fuse is split.
[37:11.88]Fuse a name of a drop turt.
[37:15.72]Pop top.
[37:16.76]How about we fuse a name of a pop top?
[37:19.58]I like pop top.
[37:21.28]Or drop turt.
[37:22.16]Drop pop.
[37:23.68]Drop pop.
[37:24.42]Pop drop.
[37:29.51]How about drop pop?
[37:33.39]So that's how you split.
[37:37.47]Is that how you do it?
[37:41.93]Wake up.
[37:43.79]Split just makes you get rid of monsters.
[37:45.09]Can I even do it this early in this stage of the game or no?
[37:50.17]Drop box.
[37:56.60]Drop turd.
[37:59.04]I don't think we can do it.
[38:01.04]Did they remove it in this game?
[38:04.82]You can't fuse in Monster Rancher 3.
[38:08.00]Uh-oh.
[38:09.08]Well, that sucks.
[38:13.02]okay it looks like drop top is the winner I'm gonna close this in 10 seconds five four three two one drop top is the winner that's who we're playing with first you want to wake up drop top yes I do thank you for voting
[38:41.12]Why is somebody from Streamlabs trying to chat with me?
[38:44.45]Is this a fucking pop-up ad?
[38:45.77]Yeah, it is.
[38:46.27]Alright, there it is.
[38:48.81]There's Drop Top.
[38:51.28]So let's take, uh, let's go to move.
[38:53.10]Let's take Drop Top into the, uh, city shrine.
[38:57.30]Morks.
[38:58.96]We have to go to Morks.
[38:59.95]Move here.
[39:06.70]It just popped up on the screen.
[39:07.96]It's like, hey, it's me, Michelle.
[39:09.52]How you doing?
[39:10.18]How's your stream labs?
[39:11.48]It's one of those in-the-corner fake people.
[39:13.28]Alright, we're in Morks.
[39:15.86]This land is a giant forest.
[39:16.92]This is the spot I choose.
[39:21.37]Or chose.
[39:22.77]We can train, taking full advantage of Morks' characteristics.
[39:26.41]It's spacious and feels good.
[39:28.47]It's perfect, isn't it?
[39:30.31]Drop Top will be able to grow well.
[39:33.37]I'm awesome, aren't I?
[39:41.22]So do I have to praise and scold the trainer?
[39:45.08]Oh I see, you're mean.
[39:51.70]I'm gonna go in there and get a fucking Triforce or what?
[39:53.60]This is the only place I can train but you'll be allowed to train in other places if you keep winning tournaments in different regions.
[40:03.29]So then this is our home.
[40:04.69]This is where our life as breeders begins.
[40:07.46]Under a fucking tree.
[40:09.29]Okay, at least in the last game we got a house Um, are you new here Yes, we are.
[40:22.12]We live under a tree.
[40:23.14]Can I help you?
[40:24.64]I'm muji.
[40:25.60]I sell items here.
[40:26.60]I just wanted to drop in and say hi Oh, really?
[40:29.58]And you're gonna give us a good deal today, right?
[40:33.23]No, I wasn't planning on... Oh, I see.
[40:34.63]Don't bother coming around here anymore, then.
[40:37.45]We'll just buy stuff from other people.
[40:42.88]What?
[40:43.22]Oh, man.
[40:43.82]Okay, okay.
[40:44.44]Look at that face.
[40:46.14]I'll give you this, so please.
[40:49.26]Is that a mushroom stew?
[40:52.18]That's mean.
[40:54.06]Please be nice.
[40:54.72]Actually, learn from the best.
[40:56.92]Woohoo!
[40:57.50]It looks like we'll get bonuses in the future.
[40:59.53]We're lucky.
[41:04.84]Who the fuck is this?
[41:07.64]Gadamon, I heard that you are finally training a monster.
[41:12.61]That's right, I'm going to train a strong monster with Jeremy.
[41:18.33]Ha, ha, ha, dummy.
[41:22.13]A team with a newbie and a little girl like you is no match for the two-chew can ace.
[41:27.47]Gadamon.
[41:29.28]My powers are... Jeremy, that's Gatomon.
[41:32.01]She's a Tochikon just like me.
[41:33.63]She became a breeder just a little bit before me.
[41:37.71]But she's not that strong, I think.
[41:40.23]Then I won at the tournament.
[41:43.05]And Gatomon, you're bugging us.
[41:44.73]Go away.
[41:46.15]Listen to me, you punks.
[41:48.13]We're going to hurry and start training.
[41:51.62]HMPH.
[41:53.36]What's that stand for?
[41:56.26]HMPH.
[42:00.88]Let me show you what battles are all about.
[42:04.02]I'm fucking kidding.
[42:04.94]I know what that means.
[42:05.68]Don't think I'm stupid.
[42:06.82]I've never used a computer before.
[42:11.19]So this is training you how to fight.
[42:19.21]Drop Top versus Galaha.
[42:21.75]What?
[42:21.91]Do you get like a cool fucking disco dog?
[42:24.87]I want like a disco magician Merlin DJ dog.
[42:27.45]What the fuck?
[42:33.78]Alright, so this is how it, this is different.
[42:35.82]So, back and forth?
[42:37.60]What does down do?
[42:38.36]Can you duck?
[42:41.34]I'm actually confused as to how the fuck to do anything.
[42:45.34]I guess this is, okay, this is close.
[42:50.68]Uh, what?
[42:54.56]Five?
[42:56.05]So what, how do you do a move?
[42:57.11]Okay, gel sweep.
[43:00.07]Dodged.
[43:02.05]So yeah, I guess this is the slot, I understand.
[43:07.45]It's a little... It's actually a lot different than the last game.
[43:11.39]Gale sweep, level up.
[43:14.51]Here we go, 24.
[43:17.17]I can't do anything here?
[43:18.99]Why can I not do that move up close?
[43:22.23]Does it not tell you how much guts the move uses?
[43:24.40]Because I'm up close and I can't use it.
[43:32.12]Seems strange.
[43:33.30]Because I have nothing in this slot.
[43:42.97]I think I lost.
[43:43.59]Yeah, I did.
[43:48.85]It's a different button for different ranks.
[43:52.47]Really?
[43:52.75]That's weird.
[44:03.04]From beanbag to water bed.
[44:05.70]When I'm pressing the right button, I was just pressing X. It's not our fault.
[44:14.02]We haven't had the chance to do any training yet.
[44:16.74]Probably could have won that if I knew what the fuck was going on.
[44:25.52]Lost the tutorial?
[44:26.56]They didn't tell me how to do anything in the tutorial.
[44:28.58]I didn't lose the tutorial.
[44:30.00]I was never told anything.
[44:36.89]That's like showing up to your math class final.
[44:42.14]And the teacher hasn't told you anything all year.
[44:46.70]And then she's laughing at you while you take the test.
[44:49.06]Because why don't you know this idiot?
[44:51.44]What are you stupid?
[44:52.90]It's like teacher you haven't opened a textbook for fucking 300 days.
[44:56.94]What are you dumb?
[44:57.83]You don't know how to do that thing?
[44:58.91]What are you fucking stupid?
[45:00.61]So like normally...
[45:12.64]Oh, you're just a trainee, but... School for 300 days?
[45:15.94]Yeah, 365.
[45:16.08]You get like two months off of school.
[45:31.55]Yeah, this guy's facial hair does look like six toothpicks that has hair on them that he, like, is folding around his face.
[45:39.92]As you can see, Gadamon and Flare are rivals from long ago.
[45:43.04]They might cause you trouble, okay?
[45:44.39]Be patient.
[45:45.53]Oh, well, I brought you a gift.
[45:48.09]Wow, is it a mask?
[45:49.31]It's a fun accessory that lets you change styles.
[45:52.37]Oh, yeah, Jeremy, do you know about accessories?
[45:54.32]No!
[45:54.86]Fucking goddammit!
[45:57.88]The one thing I wanted to learn, because I'm just pressing X. Some accessories, you can't put on monsters if the monster's the same type.
[46:15.34]Fucking God damn it.
[46:17.53]So let's put on that mask using the accessory command.
[46:25.61]He does turn into the cute.
[46:27.11]He's a Yoshi's Island monster.
[46:29.71]Alright, uh, item.
[46:34.70]Skipping tutorials.
[46:35.72]No, I wasn't skipping tutorials.
[46:37.56]I just... That's the first time they've given me that option.
[46:40.42]Equip.
[46:42.61]You can play with many faces.
[46:47.49]What, there's cosmetics?
[46:48.41]That's not even on my face.
[46:54.20]Connect picture Paradise compatible camera and press X button.
[47:00.62]Hold on.
[47:03.18]I can put my face on there if I have to.
[47:05.70]You think I can track down a fucking PlayStation 2 camera?
[47:11.36]So it's just like a fun accessory.
[47:12.74]This is terrible.
[47:13.48]I don't want this.
[47:20.21]do it.
[47:20.61]I don't have a PlayStation 3.
[47:24.13]PlayStation 2 camera.
[47:26.71]Okay.
[47:28.63]Soup made by simmering various types of mushrooms adjusts nutritional balance.
[47:31.76]Okay.
[47:33.96]Let's just train, I guess.
[47:36.98]He's just wearing a pie on his head.
[47:38.34]Alright.
[47:38.84]Raise, rest, battle.
[47:40.88]I'm gonna assume raise.
[47:43.52]Trampoline.
[47:45.36]Picking.
[47:46.30]Block.
[47:46.90]Three-step jump or nutcrack.
[47:51.33]Okay, so we got defense, speed, intelligence, power, life.
[47:56.07]Can I look at his stats?
[47:59.00]You're not going to give me a quick way to look at the stats right here?
[48:01.52]Okay.
[48:02.54]Monster.
[48:05.24]So, life is probably pretty important here.
[48:07.74]Life, and then we need to teach him intelligence moves.
[48:10.66]Life and speed are pretty terrible.
[48:12.07]Let's do life.
[48:17.13]Do nutcrack.
[48:19.05]What the hell are you doing?
[48:22.51]Okay, trampoline.
[48:24.21]Go for it.
[48:34.72]Alright, when he fails, he turns into Maggie Simpson.
[48:40.29]Or Bart Simpson.
[48:43.13]He didn't finish the training.
[48:44.73]Do you want to say something to Drop Top?
[48:47.09]No big deal.
[48:47.69]Try harder.
[48:48.31]Terrible.
[48:48.89]Or keep at it.
[48:50.67]Try harder.
[48:52.01]Looks like it's regretting what it did.
[48:56.89]Whimsical.
[48:59.64]Drop top is healthy.
[49:02.80]Turns into a worm, too.
[49:03.82]That's kind of cool.
[49:04.40]Alright, raise a trampoline.
[49:06.58]Let's get over 100.
[49:15.20]God damn it.
[49:25.85]Shit.
[49:26.85]Didn't do very well.
[49:27.83]Do you want to say something?
[49:30.95]Awful.
[49:31.49]No.
[49:31.93]No big deal.
[49:32.71]We can't... We gotta keep... We gotta be balanced.
[49:40.38]He seems a little tired.
[49:41.40]Then... Why don't you... Let's take a look at that.
[49:44.98]Alright.
[49:45.46]Free.
[49:46.18]What the hell does this mean?
[49:47.50]Free?
[49:50.07]So this is E-Cup.
[49:51.61]Thousand money.
[49:53.43]Format, League, Region, Morphs.
[49:55.53]It's different regions I am seeing here.
[50:00.04]Free.
[50:01.00]No prize money.
[50:02.88]You get a Flare Stone?
[50:07.96]What the hell that means?
[50:12.69]Uh, this is the official tournament, right?
[50:16.93]Well, the weeks are... months are different here.
[50:19.99]Uh, let's just rest him.
[50:28.20]Put him in a Class A tournament.
[50:29.72]That's probably a really bad idea.
[50:42.69]It's full of energy.
[50:45.95]Try it again.
[50:47.45]Trample me.
[50:48.06]Please.
[50:48.70]Do it correctly.
[50:54.26]One bounce.
[50:55.72]Two bounce.
[50:57.78]Oh my god, why are you so bad?
[51:00.14]Can I please get one stat increase?
[51:04.43]I gotta get this mask off his head.
[51:05.85]It's really... I don't like it.
[51:13.36]Class A or we go away.
[51:15.64]That's not how it works.
[51:17.10]You understand that I'm not going to be able to do that.
[51:20.15]Even though you're still a beginner, you do know that you have to feed your monster, right?
[51:23.99]Well, since it's so important, let me explain again.
[51:27.01]At the beginning of each month, you have to choose a type of food to feed your monster.
[51:30.97]When you choose, pay attention to favorite food and nutrition.
[51:34.34]The favorite food gauge shows how much the monster likes that type of food.
[51:39.09]The nutrition gauge shows how much nutrition in the food is needed to buy the monster at that time.
[51:44.39]If you keep feeding it only one type of food, its nutrition will become unbalanced.
[51:49.04]That's about it.
[51:49.68]Do you understand?
[51:50.24]Do not explain it again.
[51:54.34]Alright, potato, wacky fish, bone-in meat, carrot, nuts.
[52:03.69]Alright, so let's go with the balanced one.
[52:05.99]This is potato.
[52:06.63]Potato is the worst.
[52:08.68]He'd feed him a wacky fish.
[52:12.03]Uh... What about nuts?
[52:16.43]What are nuts?
[52:19.55]Meat in the bone?
[52:20.77]That's 200 bucks!
[52:21.73]No.
[52:22.83]He's eating nuts.
[52:24.95]You're eating nuts.
[52:27.45]Healthy, full of good fats.
[52:31.88]Use your Kermit the Frog mouth and eat them.
[52:35.00]Looks like it doesn't care.
[52:41.04]Alright, can I please do something here?
[52:47.18]Raise.
[52:49.28]Trampoline.
[52:55.36]Don't do four in a row.
[52:59.42]He did it.
[52:59.96]Finally.
[53:03.23]What do we get for this?
[53:03.93]I'm curious.
[53:07.29]Plus five health.
[53:09.91]All that for nothing.
[53:15.53]He looks healthy.
[53:16.35]When's the first battle?
[53:17.17]Alright, let's rest him.
[53:20.99]Let's just go into a battle.
[53:22.61]Let's do it.
[53:24.83]Take a rest.
[53:25.97]Time for a battle.
[53:26.59]Let's go.
[53:28.06]Oh boy.
[53:28.96]That's money.
[53:29.94]That's a lot of money.
[53:32.08]That's a very large amount of money.
[53:34.78]Hold on a minute here.
[53:35.54]Uh... Comfort Eagle.
[53:40.90]Comfort Eagle.
[53:43.65]Just gave $100, 10,000 bits.
[53:45.45]Thanks a lot, Comfort Eagle.
[53:49.37]And you say, hey, Jerm, I've been a fan since the ages of TF2 gameplay commentary.
[53:54.83]I love the sticking.
[53:55.63]I love sticking with you over the years, and you brought me many a laugh and a feel.
[53:59.90]Thank you all for all you've done for the community.
[54:02.64]Keep up the hard work, and here's to you.
[54:04.84]Well, cheers to you, Comfort Eagle.
[54:08.06]Thank you for watching.
[54:12.85]Live gameplay commentary.
[54:15.21]Yeah, I remember those days.
[54:17.29]Don't really do that anymore, but... I love just... No, that was a... That was a Fred Flintstone slip.
[54:26.69]And that's all there is to it.
[54:28.03]You understand?
[54:31.85]Now we're gonna go... Let's put Drop Top in the tournament.
[54:35.85]Is there no loyalty in this game?
[54:39.73]But thank you, dude.
[54:42.58]Cheers to you.
[54:43.60]Thank you for the hundred fucking dollars.
[54:46.18]This isn't a gameplay commentary?
[54:47.56]Is it a gameplay commentary?
[54:48.60]I don't know, man.
[54:53.10]We got some great... Jimmy, Spinocchio, and Sheeshul.
[55:03.66]Okay, let's go.
[55:04.28]Match.
[55:04.72]Forfeit.
[55:05.20]Data.
[55:05.49]Alright, Sheeshul has barely any defense.
[55:10.85]got a lot of intelligence we need to stay away from pollen so we need to stay in close let's go give orders to drop top yeah let me hopefully I can figure this out so x and we just need to stay close I still have the dumb like I have the dumb like pog on my head okay so he yeah yeah yeah yeah it's getting close
[55:38.99]Then give him a little tap Yeah, he's just dancing gel charge bingo do it again Can handle it only four damage is fine 20 he's got a lot of health His eyes move around like hands
[56:06.48]He's not going to do very much damage.
[56:07.52]We have too much defense.
[56:09.42]And I'm not backing up to get hit by his good intelligence move, so let's just stay in here.
[56:14.60]Oh boy, wait a minute.
[56:16.74]Alright, is it triangle?
[56:17.64]How do I do that?
[56:18.54]Nice block.
[56:19.75]Nice block.
[56:20.45]I wonder if I can bridge the gap here in a second.
[56:26.31]Yep.
[56:29.21]It's alright.
[56:30.03]Follow it up with a punch.
[56:31.83]Stop fucking dancing.
[56:33.31]Stop dancing.
[56:34.91]Oh my god.
[56:37.15]With the mask on, too, it just looks like he's putting his fists up and down.
[56:42.03]Hit him.
[56:48.02]Big hit, right?
[56:48.58]Yeah.
[56:52.18]Nice.
[56:54.42]So, we can usually gauge how much anybody likes this guy by... I mean, does the audience like Drop Top or do they hate Drop Top?
[57:03.03]We'll find out.
[57:14.73]Rewind to the rhyme.
[57:15.85]Alright, Jimmy just flawless victoried.
[57:18.17]Alright, Jimmy's the one we have to be aware of here.
[57:23.15]Okay, we're going up against Spinokio.
[57:26.21]Spinokio has very low life and low defense, but he's very fast.
[57:30.73]Okay.
[57:39.68]Jimmy versus Scott.
[57:46.02]No, it's just a dumb dog.
[57:48.40]But then again, I have a dumb jelly person.
[57:50.20]Like, this character's dumb.
[57:55.98]Let's back it up and do it again.
[57:58.13]Jail sweep.
[57:59.17]Do jail sweep again.
[58:02.59]Dizzy.
[58:05.07]Oh, he's dizzy.
[58:05.65]I don't know what that means.
[58:08.45]He just drops his speed.
[58:09.69]I can do one more of these.
[58:12.41]Jail charge.
[58:18.38]Let's pull back.
[58:20.52]What's the... Get away from me.
[58:22.90]What's the reverse Scorpion Mortal Kombat move?
[58:26.70]Oh, okay.
[58:27.24]That's called an instant death.
[58:28.66]I have to kill him now.
[58:31.81]I gotta pull this out now.
[58:33.25]Like, he needs to get hit.
[58:36.97]Nice.
[58:37.31]Come on.
[58:40.21]Oh, stay all the way back.
[58:41.33]All the way back.
[58:41.87]No, no.
[58:42.19]Don't let him do it again.
[58:43.05]Stay back.
[58:44.37]I need 15, and then I'm gonna go for... This is it.
[58:46.09]1, 2, 3.
[58:46.15]Got it.
[58:49.21]Oh boy dodge it Does it show the percentages anymore I Can't tell How that works because it used to show what percentage you have and you could gauge it is that showing up anywhere?
[59:12.63]I don't really see it anymore
[59:19.61]Guts determines chance to hit and dodge.
[59:21.87]Okay.
[59:28.01]That's different.
[59:35.69]So you shouldn't just use guts.
[59:37.33]It has more to do with conserving your guts?
[59:46.91]I'm gonna assume, I guess?
[59:54.22]Confused that's not good That's not good Just follow it up again So does he have an a 90% chance to dodge and 90% chance to hit yeah, I can't be right I
[60:20.31]That stupid hot potato dance!
[60:22.07]Stop doing that!
[60:22.95]Oh my god, stop it!
[60:30.77]Yeah, this is just a Nesquik rabbit.
[60:32.31]Oh my god.
[60:34.99]Did I- I don't even know if I won.
[60:39.68]I don't even... No, I won.
[60:50.12]This game does not show hit percentages.
[60:52.62]So you kind of just have to guess, huh?
[60:57.28]Well, okay.
[60:58.48]I'm going to have to try.
[61:04.21]The hot potato dance is the new dab.
[61:06.37]Do some quick maths.
[61:25.10]We didn't win the championship, but we did pretty well.
[61:27.91]We want to say something.
[61:31.47]Good work.
[61:37.87]He missed the dab.
[61:40.60]Well, I can't bring that back.
[61:42.34]That's gone forever.
[61:44.32]Rival?
[61:44.96]Battle?
[61:45.54]Spit?
[61:46.02]I thought it said, like, spit in his face.
[61:48.84]Trade?
[61:49.14]I don't know.
[61:49.48]What do you want me to do here?
[61:51.66]There aren't any stone fragments.
[61:55.15]Battle?
[61:56.71]Oh, no.
[61:57.27]They're at the same level?
[61:59.22]Alright, so yeah, yeah, yeah.
[62:00.48]Let's battle.
[62:02.98]This time I know how to actually do a move.
[62:11.17]Is dab not in the game?
[62:12.09]No, dab's not in the game.
[62:13.97]The, uh... I would say, like...
[62:17.95]Your grandfather getting in the circle during a wedding dance-off is his dance he does, that he has.
[62:25.13]Like, we are family is playing during a wedding, and he gets in the middle and starts doing this thing.
[62:30.85]Everyone's cheering for him.
[62:31.91]It's like the one thing he does, and everybody knows it was awful, but he's like fucking 80 years old.
[62:46.64]Like, what do you want him to do?
[62:52.73]You'll see it.
[62:54.03]There it is.
[62:54.79]Ah, god damn it.
[62:55.89]You didn't get to see it.
[63:03.46]Just kill him.
[63:06.18]Get rid of Snoopy's weird hipster brother.
[63:12.99]Done.
[63:23.06]Russia.
[63:31.84]So what do I get for doing that?
[63:38.24]Jazz Snoopy.
[63:43.29]Does that mean I can get that monster?
[63:47.19]Okay, I'm alright with this.
[63:52.03]Do you want to say something?
[63:53.85]Beautiful.
[63:55.71]It doesn't care.
[63:57.99]Can I fight again?
[63:58.81]Alright, just split?
[64:02.07]Later.
[64:02.89]Oh, that just means get away from me.
[64:04.25]I see.
[64:05.65]Let's rest.
[64:08.31]So how do you learn new moves in this game?
[64:14.23]There doesn't seem to be any training besides the jump on twigs.
[64:21.20]sure we'll find out the light of Earth rises when it's time for seasons to change the light that gives unconditionally the light that brings the awakening the birth of Jesus Christ this I told you that's why we this is the veggie tales monster
[64:45.25]This is an old Christian saying.
[64:47.31]Basically what it's saying is, when the season changes, the Earth power grows and many things occur.
[64:53.18]Then I'm going to tell you what it's all about.
[64:55.74]When the season changes, Catholics go venture to places with their monsters.
[65:02.80]That's because monsters can learn different skills in different places.
[65:08.18]Hi there.
[65:10.08]It is once again time to go venture.
[65:12.56]Would you like some ran-ran?
[65:15.91]Do you know why?
[65:19.29]This game is stupid.
[65:36.97]Like, Monster Rancher 2 was cheeky and campy.
[65:41.11]This is like going off on like magical, mystical fucking bullshit.
[65:44.65]I don't know about this one.
[65:47.41]Yeah, that's basically it, of course.
[65:48.85]It's better if you experience the effects for yourself.
[65:51.05]Let's go get spiritually enlightened in Monster Rancher 3.
[65:55.43]So why don't you try buying a Ranran?
[65:58.24]Yes, yes, I have all kinds of Ranrans for you.
[66:03.30]The expensive ones will last longer, you see.
[66:07.61]Ranran leaf, ranran fruit, ranran extract, ranran smell.
[66:13.23]It's free to just smell it.
[66:15.39]So I can lean over the counter and just like... Allows you to see the Earth light for a time.
[66:24.96]These are expensive.
[66:32.08]It's free to smell.
[66:33.00]Should I... I don't know what this means.
[66:38.30]That's 500 gold, and... Let's just smell it.
[66:42.88]Do you want to buy this item?
[66:44.02]Yes, I would like to smell your items.
[66:46.71]I will come back for the next season change.
[66:48.91]Oh, shit.
[66:53.85]I probably should have done something, right?
[66:55.81]I don't know.
[66:56.23]I just smelled his drugs and he left.
[66:59.37]Which way?
[66:59.87]Use the directional keys to move.
[67:01.40]You also have to tell Drop Top to go places to look for items.
[67:05.04]Use the X button to search.
[67:06.30]Let me know if you want to quit.
[67:11.31]I walk around?
[67:12.02]Where the hell am I supposed to go?
[67:18.00]I don't know what I'm supposed to do!
[67:19.56]Light of the Earth!
[67:21.56]Do you want to search this place?
[67:23.00]Sure.
[67:26.51]Wow, you found a succulent fruit.
[67:31.15]Great drop top, you did it.
[67:35.23]Jeremy, I think I ran, ran, ran out.
[67:44.30]Oh shit, my ran ran ran out.
[67:46.45]That's unfortunate.
[67:51.99]Alright, well.
[67:55.95]Ran ran ran.
[67:58.43]Let's give him some fucking wacky fish.
[68:03.26]Let's give him, I don't know.
[68:04.46]How about no more nuts.
[68:08.36]Let's give him some meat.
[68:09.20]Let's do favorite and yeah, feed him some meat.
[68:18.38]So I think I understand what's happening here.
[68:21.26]At the end of a season, you buy Ran-Ran, and then you just sprint around, running around like crazy, trying to find skill-ups until the timer is over.
[68:35.33]And the timer is delayed, you get more time based on how much Ran-Ran you consume.
[68:40.71]So you have to do as many drugs as you can until you hit the crash.
[68:48.04]Okay.
[68:52.05]So, let me see here.
[68:52.89]What do we got?
[68:53.23]Battle... What's the next battle we got?
[68:56.05]We got this one.
[68:56.67]This is the Shrine.
[68:57.53]Regent's Shrine.
[68:59.39]Only 500 bucks?
[69:00.45]Get out of here.
[69:03.46]Uh, let's rest.
[69:05.84]Actually, no!
[69:06.76]No, no, no.
[69:10.56]We still need more health.
[69:14.28]This is all I have access to?
[69:18.84]I just do trampoline again.
[69:27.51]I don't like the camera snap thing.
[69:31.76]When the black bars close down.
[69:33.64]Why do you have to do that?
[69:35.36]I don't want to see that.
[69:44.95]Ah, yeah.
[69:45.31]Save the game.
[69:46.07]Good call.
[69:46.67]Thanks for reminding me.
[70:00.07]What's with the bar on her face?
[70:02.63]Yeah, I think that's how much she likes me.
[70:05.61]So, she's losing interest in me.
[70:10.34]Oh well.
[70:13.92]Uh, we're over 100.
[70:14.46]Let's get, like, 120.
[70:15.66]Oh, well, we can skip it.
[70:20.19]Alright.
[70:23.11]5, at least I go for 120.
[70:31.13]Looks healthy the new monster's loyalties on the left.
[70:34.21]Oh, well, I thought it was over this heart over her head 120 health and I'll be satisfied Success 12 120
[70:58.18]The Tochicon Fest is this week.
[71:01.46]But Dropbox doesn't look well.
[71:02.82]Maybe we should wait until it's better.
[71:04.32]What do you think?
[71:04.80]A little tired.
[71:06.94]Yeah.
[71:07.58]Just take a rest.
[71:09.12]We're not doing the tournament.
[71:10.74]This sucks too much.
[71:18.59]What happened to Quadratic?
[71:24.49]I have an Elvis haircut?
[71:27.49]So?
[71:29.64]What are we giving Dropbox this time?
[71:30.88]Let's go back to the... What have we got for nutrition?
[71:38.95]Let's go nuts.
[71:42.21]That's pretty typical.
[71:47.46]Conan.
[71:51.46]Full of energy.
[71:54.20]What's the next battle?
[71:56.93]Right here.
[71:58.85]Kalaragi.
[72:00.81]Four.
[72:02.11]We get an ornament.
[72:03.91]And we get a monster, too.
[72:05.39]We get a monster here.
[72:06.17]Hmm.
[72:10.14]I still want a trampoline.
[72:19.72]Why is his name File Sharing?
[72:21.14]I don't know.
[72:22.06]It's easy to say.
[72:22.78]I'm going to keep fucking up his name.
[72:24.88]What did I say last time?
[72:25.76]Drop Top?
[72:27.11]That is his name.
[72:30.58]One more time.
[72:31.12]120 health and I'll be happy.
[72:32.70]Go.
[72:35.76]I'm going to watch this one through.
[72:39.44]Two.
[72:39.80]Three.
[72:42.78]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[72:51.19]Rock fucks.
[72:54.23]Oh, is this the emoji movie?
[72:56.49]I actually watched the emoji movie.
[72:59.20]I had to.
[73:02.40]I canceled a doctor's appointment to watch the emoji movie.
[73:07.50]I had like a very serious doctor's appointment to go to and like I had to watch it.
[73:11.50]It was just available.
[73:13.86]So I just didn't go to my doctor's appointment.
[73:16.78]And guess what?
[73:18.44]The emoji movie cured me.
[73:20.77]I'm no longer sick anymore.
[73:26.50]Do it again.
[73:26.92]You don't get to sleep until you do it.
[73:32.14]Fuck.
[73:37.92]We watched- No, no, we- Okay, here's a fun thing to do.
[73:43.03]By the way, I'm just kidding.
[73:43.97]I didn't skip my doctor's appointment to watch the worst movie that was ever made.
[73:49.17]But the only reason why I bring up the emoji movie is because Dropbox is blatantly in it like five times.
[73:55.08]They're like, yeah, we gotta watch out for Dropbox.
[73:57.66]Make sure we go through the file sharing system Dropbox.
[74:01.23]It's everywhere.
[74:03.91]That whole movie is a Candy Crush ad as well.
[74:07.07]Oh no, what the fuck?
[74:08.08]My internet's dying.
[74:11.08]Don't... Oh my god.
[74:16.87]Hey, let's... Hey, the internet doesn't work.
[74:19.58]What do you know?
[74:20.20]Look at the internet.
[74:21.30]Hey, don't you just love the internet?
[74:26.42]Don't you do it.
[74:27.37]Don't do it.
[74:28.97]I refuse to let you do this to me.
[74:30.61]Don't do this to me.
[74:31.47]Don't do it.
[74:33.25]Stay here.
[74:36.70]Wait a minute.
[74:36.98]I need to text somebody.
[74:38.76]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[74:47.85]I was told by, like, the Comcast representative that, like, right when the problem starts, like, immediately text this guy.
[74:55.74]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[75:06.17]Oh, shit, what's his number?
[75:07.43]I gotta go get his number.
[75:10.45]Oh, goddammit.
[75:15.92]His number's like pinned up on my fridge upstairs.
[75:23.00]Oh shit.
[75:24.06]This is such horse shit.
[75:26.78]I lose power yesterday.
[75:28.18]This house is a fucking train wreck.
[75:33.05]This is like an uninhabitable house.
[75:34.85]Alright, hold on.
[75:41.23]I need to make sure that... What the fuck is the problem?
[75:47.05]Why is it doing this There's nothing wrong with my internet right now I'm doing a speed test right now.
[75:57.82]There's nothing wrong with my internet It's perfect what is going on
[76:15.34]Don't even tell me this is another issue with, like, Twitch's fucking ingest server.
[76:19.24]Yeah, there's nothing wrong with my internet.
[76:26.23]Oh, come on.
[76:26.81]Really, Twitch?
[76:29.59]Why do I have a problem with every single Twitch server?
[76:33.79]I'm gonna change ingest servers.
[76:35.63]Don't go anywhere.
[76:36.33]Everybody stay put.
[76:37.39]Don't fucking move.
[76:38.62]Nobody move.
[76:39.56]Don't move.
[76:41.28]I see how many people are here right now.
[76:43.58]I'll know you left.
[76:45.10]Be right back.
[76:58.63]What the fuck?
[76:59.25]It's even worse.
[77:05.17]Oh, come on, man.
[77:08.47]It's worse than before.
[77:09.76]It's even worse.
[77:17.22]What the hell?
[77:20.20]It's worse than before.
[77:26.99]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[77:34.91]It's fucking way worse.
[77:47.05]well I don't know if anybody can hear me but hi this is great I think we're are we okay now are we good are we alright am I even live right now what the was that
[78:19.36]Alright, let's let Dropbox rest this week.
[78:23.46]Hi everybody.
[78:27.96]That was fun.
[78:33.52]Jesus.
[78:37.88]You can feed him nothing?
[78:38.77]A mushroom that grows in the morgues where you can feed him... Let's give him vine grass.
[78:48.05]I mean, I could give him stem mushrooms, hax and peach, Vinesauce, morx mushrooms, or nothing.
[78:56.64]Let's see how we... Whoa.
[79:00.48]He loves this, and it's really, really good for you.
[79:03.94]Let's give him that.
[79:07.30]Sounds good.
[79:14.93]It looks very satisfying.
[79:19.16]We want a new monster.
[79:24.54]No, no new monster.
[79:25.87]Alright, we train and then we go into the battle.
[79:30.71]Let's go with power for now.
[79:34.03]Let's see what he does here.
[79:34.71]Alright, you just replace seesaw with a mushroom.
[79:42.98]He did it.
[79:45.38]I don't know what he did, but he did something.
[79:54.55]Don't believe speed test.
[79:56.95]Yeah, I don't like typically.
[79:59.25]But, I mean... Usually when I have internet problems and I run a speed test on speedtest.net, I do get awful numbers.
[80:08.38]If I have an actual internet problem.
[80:10.00]Alright, let's go fight.
[80:14.32]Four contestants.
[80:16.14]Put it in drop top.
[80:22.93]Alright, the green tournament.
[80:27.61]Give it a go.
[80:33.49]Okay.
[80:34.49]Drop Top, Plum, Six, and Galaha.
[80:37.05]Haven't we already beat Galaha?
[80:38.99]No, it's the rival.
[80:42.71]Drop Top versus Plum.
[80:43.71]Let's take a look at the data.
[80:47.83]Plum is pretty similar.
[80:49.97]Just need to get good hits.
[80:52.84]Speed might be an issue though.
[81:03.39]That's one of those default king ddd enemies I think yeah, we're better.
[81:11.78]We just got to get lucky and land good hits Right off the bat That's shit Level two ow
[81:29.53]Stop dancing and attack.
[81:37.11]Please, please!
[81:40.18]Fucking beat the King Dedede anime monster!
[81:42.78]Damn it.
[81:54.96]Gel charge.
[81:55.90]Bingo.
[81:57.56]Okay.
[81:58.16]Good.
[81:58.32]Do it again.
[82:09.49]Again.
[82:12.11]What is this music?
[82:14.77]Uh, this music is... the Walk Around Overworld song from Nick Arcade.
[82:24.20]What was that stupid guy's name in Nick Arcade?
[82:27.91]It was like, you gotta drive Max around the tiles, and.
[82:30.35]And every time he walked.
[82:31.27]What was his name?
[82:40.60]Let's see.
[82:41.58]Nick Arcade.
[82:42.18]What was his name?
[82:43.26]It was like Stevie or something.
[82:45.24]Mikey.
[82:45.72]Was it Mikey?
[82:57.25]There it is.
[82:57.95]That was probably really loud.
[82:59.83]That was it.
[83:10.19]That was Mikey walking around.
[83:15.17]You'll hear it.
[83:15.53]Hey, by the way, internet is going down again.
[83:18.61]Going down.
[83:20.93]Down we go.
[83:21.53]Uh oh.
[83:32.18]Low defense though.
[83:35.00]High intelligence.
[83:35.76]Get away from the intelligence moves.
[83:36.96]Just stay the fuck away from that.
[83:43.68]Just do not let him get into that zone.
[83:52.48]Don't let him lick me.
[83:53.65]That's what he wants to do.
[84:05.44]Get it.
[84:05.66]Good.
[84:08.61]Alright, now back it up.
[84:10.81]Is it square or is it triangle to back him up?
[84:15.29]Wow.
[84:15.95]Well, that's... Whoa.
[84:18.30]Wow.
[84:19.54]Absolute whoa.
[84:20.96]That was not good.
[84:23.16]Come on, get lucky.
[84:24.02]Get lucky.
[84:24.26]One more.
[84:25.80]Get lucky here.
[84:26.46]Come on.
[84:26.96]Come on, back it up.
[84:27.96]It's square.
[84:29.81]Hit it and win.
[84:30.83]20.
[84:33.57]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[84:35.93]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[84:37.49]Dodge it.
[84:38.24]Oh, come on.
[84:41.44]Give me a fucking break.
[84:45.64]Like, what the hell?
[84:49.55]Got just two moves and... Please.
[85:02.37]That guy did two moves.
[85:05.63]One did... Whatever.
[85:11.41]Your monster sucks ass.
[85:18.88]Too bad.
[85:36.51]That's fucking funny.
[85:40.19]So how do we learn new moves?
[85:42.88]Do we have to find a new move in the wilderness and pay like three grand?
[85:46.26]I don't understand.
[85:48.28]Maybe if I took the small pizza off of his forehead, this wouldn't be so bad.
[85:58.44]And maybe if he didn't just do the sleepy sad emoji.
[86:06.79]We wouldn't have this much of an issue.
[86:08.05]Alright, look.
[86:11.49]It's this person's back.
[86:12.49]Get out of here.
[86:18.52]I don't even want to talk to you.
[86:24.08]Um, okay.
[86:26.45]Let's raise our...
[86:31.33]I'm not even sure what the hell to raise here.
[86:33.09]Power?
[86:33.79]Or speed, maybe?
[86:34.91]Maybe speed, just because it's so low.
[86:47.54]I don't like these animations either.
[86:48.78]Remember how cute the other ones were?
[86:51.90]And how endearing they were?
[86:55.20]This is just jump from twig to twig for every single thing.
[86:59.49]Or stare at a mushroom and have your eyes dilate.
[87:08.06]Great job.
[87:16.22]So what's the difference between this one and Monster Rancher 4?
[87:18.45]Alright, here we go.
[87:23.37]We're gonna spend a bunch of money this time.
[87:25.09]We need to get some RanRans.
[87:31.45]How much money do I have?
[87:33.05]Alright, let's do... Allows you to see the Earthlight for a long time.
[87:37.27]Should I just buy $2,000 worth of pure RanRan extract?
[87:43.47]I'm doing it.
[87:47.09]I'm not sniffing it.
[87:48.25]We're gonna do... I'm gonna put half my life savings into RanRan drugs.
[87:56.82]The fruit?
[87:57.24]Just do the fruit?
[87:57.74]Alright, we'll do the fruit.
[88:06.02]Do you want to buy this item?
[88:07.14]Yes.
[88:07.54]Let's go.
[88:10.28]Come back for next season.
[88:11.50]Here we go.
[88:12.26]Find the stat increases.
[88:14.26]Do I find it?
[88:14.92]Let's go.
[88:17.66]Let me know if you want to quit.
[88:18.58]You start to abort.
[88:19.68]Okay, let the venture begin.
[88:20.66]Go.
[88:20.72]Go.
[88:25.97]Ran, ran.
[88:28.33]You want to search this place?
[88:29.20]Yes.
[88:32.68]Noisybug appeared.
[88:35.18]Oh, that's Master Noisy.
[88:37.52]Does that mean we can practice around here?
[88:39.18]Oh, I forgot.
[88:40.84]Jeremy, you've never practiced before, right?
[88:43.22]Let me explain what skill practice is.
[88:45.84]The skills of a monster will become more powerful when a monster grows bigger.
[88:49.56]Also, you can enhance the power of the skill itself.
[88:53.07]The secret to this are skill practices.
[88:57.19]If you venture many times, you will probably find the noisy hall where you can practice your skills.
[89:03.39]If you find it, Drop Top should try practicing there.
[89:06.89]The noisy hall will be always in the same place, so be sure to take Drop Top with you.
[89:11.53]Do you want me to repeat that?
[89:15.23]Are you done?
[89:15.63]What do you mean?
[89:16.47]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[89:16.97]Let's start the skill.
[89:18.03]Whoa, no, no, no, no.
[89:18.51]What are you doing?
[89:20.55]Which skill should we train?
[89:21.70]I don't know.
[89:24.50]Do I have to do a bunch of drugs to find this guy in a hallucination dream?
[89:33.76]I'm going to go with, I'd say gel charge.
[89:36.08]Gel charge.
[89:37.52]Is this skill okay?
[89:39.58]Yes.
[89:44.60]Skill experience 40 increased.
[89:47.68]Skill training is over.
[89:50.28]What's happening?
[89:50.96]Oh my god, what happened?
[89:51.86]Oh, okay.
[89:53.20]Keep going.
[89:56.59]I'm so lost.
[89:57.41]I feel like a child right now at Disney World.
[89:59.33]Search.
[90:07.83]Oh, Drop Top, where are you going?
[90:09.95]Oh my!
[90:12.93]Suddenly, Drop Top was inspired by the light from behind the tree and came up with a new training method.
[90:19.41]Light Learn.
[90:21.19]This is great.
[90:22.38]We should try this training method.
[90:31.92]He came up with a new algorithm.
[90:34.90]Do you want to search this place?
[90:36.26]Sure.
[90:39.90]Oh no, you found an evil leech.
[90:42.52]You feel tired.
[90:43.64]Drop Top, are you okay?
[90:44.77]Hang in there.
[90:45.35]Alright, where do you want to go, Drop Top?
[90:53.85]Right here?
[90:54.77]Okay.
[90:57.07]Search this place.
[91:01.35]Ooh, wow!
[91:02.13]You found a succulent fruit!
[91:04.07]Your speed increased!
[91:06.84]You're fantastic!
[91:07.58]You did it!
[91:11.24]Jeremy, I think I ran, ran, ran out.
[91:13.56]Okay, that's enough.
[91:16.22]Bye.
[91:19.34]Alrighty.
[91:19.78]Well, that was just swell.
[91:26.93]Just give him some nutrition.
[91:27.95]I don't care.
[91:28.75]Just give him some nuts.
[91:29.41]Who cares?
[91:31.33]Um... This one's really odd.
[91:38.69]I guess it streamlines the process of training, maybe?
[91:42.77]Because it used to be you had to have... 2,000 gold to train.
[91:48.60]A move.
[91:49.26]But you also made money that way, so how do you make money?
[91:53.24]Do you have to battle in this one too to make money?
[91:58.50]Okay.
[92:03.60]off with the mask combat tips the higher your guts meter the higher the chance of your attack hitting and your opponent's attack failing so just need to keep the guts up but then what if I get smoked alright uh when's the next battle okay I'm gonna enter him in this just because there's a chance to win it let's do power again
[92:37.63]No, he's fine.
[92:41.31]Did I also get four or just three?
[92:43.85]I'm going to play four.
[92:44.51]I wanted to see how three was first.
[92:46.75]I wanted to check it out first.
[92:50.91]Try the Light Learn.
[92:51.75]Yeah, let's see what that is.
[92:52.97]Good idea.
[92:55.26]He's healthy.
[92:55.80]Raise.
[92:56.46]Light Learn.
[92:58.98]Intelligence, speed, and low... This is a bunch of intelligence.
[93:02.22]Yeah, okay.
[93:02.96]So this is huge intelligence.
[93:05.96]But lower on power.
[93:06.98]I don't have any intelligence moves.
[93:08.76]Let's try it.
[93:11.08]What does he do?
[93:22.11]Good for you.
[93:26.57]It's not even that big of a deal.
[93:27.51]I'll just do this a bunch of times.
[93:31.15]He just points at the fruit and they turn on.
[93:33.59]Alright, we need an intelligence move.
[93:34.87]Where did we learn a fucking intelligence move?
[93:42.60]He's not ready.
[93:43.96]Rest.
[93:44.26]172 IQ.
[93:52.20]It's getting there.
[93:52.84]Okay.
[94:01.64]I can't understand such IQ training.
[94:10.02]I'm going to give him... Let's give him the peaches again.
[94:19.89]Where do I work out the library?
[94:21.57]What do you mean the library?
[94:29.07]Am I gonna play Monster Rancher Advance?
[94:30.69]I don't think I can capture a Game Boy Advance.
[94:32.81]Do Light Learn again.
[94:41.75]I'm definitely gonna play Monster Rancher 4.
[94:48.04]1, 2, 3, got it.
[94:48.56]I wish I had Intelligence removed.
[94:57.43]You're going to fail your exams tomorrow.
[94:58.91]That's not good.
[95:00.82]Study.
[95:04.36]Make some flashcards.
[95:05.20]That always worked for me.
[95:09.88]Am I streaming on fun day?
[95:12.78]What do you mean fun day?
[95:16.11]What's today right now?
[95:16.89]Today is Wednesday?
[95:18.79]Today is Wednesday, right?
[95:22.17]I think so.
[95:30.95]Well, I'm not streaming on Thursday because PAX is starting tomorrow.
[95:36.84]Do the same thing.
[95:38.92]Fuck it, right?
[95:39.58]Who cares?
[95:45.46]No!
[95:46.02]What?
[95:46.24]I skipped it.
[95:46.78]That's why I lost.
[95:52.46]Keep feeding?
[95:52.96]Just feed him mushrooms?
[95:58.05]Just keep at it.
[96:03.55]I was supposed to stream yesterday, but I lost power again.
[96:08.03]For some insane reason.
[96:12.79]What's the next thing coming up here?
[96:14.25]Battle.
[96:14.57]Uh, well.
[96:18.49]Let's try it.
[96:19.29]This is the Ice Tournament.
[96:28.82]First no-rookie battle.
[96:36.65]IRL stream with Scott.
[96:43.93]Can I have some new hair of yours?
[96:45.70]The ones I was using for voodoo are depleted of your energy.
[96:48.22]No, you ain't getting any of my hair.
[96:52.34]No hair.
[96:54.76]Sorry.
[96:55.10]Alright, this guy sucks.
[97:00.08]Just stay away from the... Actually, machine gun?
[97:07.99]This guy has a gun?
[97:13.26]That thing is so cool.
[97:14.04]I want that thing.
[97:14.80]I mean, I don't want the stats of that thing, but the monster's cool.
[97:18.60]No, no, don't say Garfield.
[97:27.33]I know somebody is, and I already said it, so you can't say it now.
[97:31.43]I kind of want to see the machine gun.
[97:39.01]Will he just do it?
[97:39.83]Do it.
[97:40.05]I wanna see it.
[97:45.16]Oh, that's terrible.
[97:52.60]Garfield.
[97:54.42]Garfield.
[97:56.27]Go get him, Garfield.
[98:00.63]Yes.
[98:01.95]Um, yes.
[98:06.25]He still will.
[98:09.59]I need to win the whole tournament.
[98:11.41]That's the problem.
[98:17.76]Shit.
[98:22.34]Finally, a dodge.
[98:28.22]I always feel like that's a huge crit, and it just never is.
[98:34.63]Is there no accuracy stat?
[98:35.89]I don't believe there is.
[98:39.32]I don't know if there is in this game.
[98:40.34]I'm gonna play Lego Island sometime.
[98:52.62]It's a childhood favorite from 1997.
[98:54.08]Oh god dammit, I need to see... Yes, I don't even know what this guy's stats are.
[99:01.44]I'm not gonna play Lego Island.
[99:06.81]If you see me play Lego Island, that means I've run out of content.
[99:12.22]Oh, goodness.
[99:17.32]Alright, really low power.
[99:19.34]High defense.
[99:26.65]Boo.
[99:26.91]What do you mean, boo?
[99:27.79]Lego Island's amazing?
[99:32.21]Is it?
[99:36.44]Lego Island is amazing, is what you're telling me.
[99:42.57]Why?
[99:42.99]What could Lego Island... I ran out of content?
[99:48.89]No, I'm saying if you see me play Lego Island, that means I ran out of things to do.
[99:59.74]You do realize now if I stream Lego Island, I've run out of fucking content.
[100:04.83]That's like what everyone's gonna say.
[100:07.13]Even if Lego Island is best game ever made, it doesn't matter.
[100:11.03]What the hell?
[100:20.17]That's a cool move.
[100:22.71]Where'd you get it?
[100:25.62]Come on, Taffy.
[100:37.03]Did you know the entire development team of LEGO Island was fired once the game was released so the company wouldn't have to give them a bonus?
[100:43.89]Well, that sounds fucking awful.
[100:48.87]Oh shit, one second.
[100:50.43]I'm good.
[100:51.81]I think I just won the tournament.
[100:56.71]Yes, I have played Bully.
[100:58.67]And yes, I've played it multiple times, actually.
[101:10.72]Lego Island.
[101:13.11]I wanna look up Lego Island.
[101:14.65]Let's see.
[101:18.77]Lego Island.
[101:22.95]Okay.
[101:23.39]Lego Island is a Lego-themed action-adventure video game developed and published by Mindscape and released for Windows.
[101:31.46]The game is the first entry in the Lego Island series and the first Lego video game to be released outside of Japan.
[101:36.78]Okay.
[101:43.84]gameplay oh now I want to play I think I want to play this like tomorrow well that means I've run out of content no I can't play it alright what if I stream that with somebody else does that mean that could I like put the contentless streamer on them
[102:07.51]You know what I mean?
[102:08.35]Like, let's say I get in contact with somebody.
[102:10.69]Like, hey, dude, I just happened to, like, hit up, I haven't hit you up in a long time.
[102:13.15]You want to collab?
[102:13.93]You want to do, like, a collab?
[102:15.89]Oh, sure, yeah, what do you want to play?
[102:17.01]Well, I wasn't going to play.
[102:17.79]I'm going to come over to your house, and we're going to stream LEGO Island from your stream into your house.
[102:23.77]So that would be, that would be they that would be at the content end of the road, right?
[102:33.60]Just, I simply suggested that to play.
[102:41.53]So pretty much how it works is if you can convince somebody to play Lego Island, then their streaming career is over, right?
[102:48.34]I wonder who I'm going to convince.
[102:53.78]Alright, let's arrest him.
[103:09.55]There's no multiplayer.
[103:10.53]Is there multiplayer in Lego Island?
[103:14.65]Stream it now.
[103:15.73]I'm not gonna... I don't have it.
[103:17.05]I don't own the game.
[103:19.64]Not only do I have to go get it, but I have to install it on Windows 10.
[103:26.22]You know how long and much of a pain in the ass that usually is?
[103:34.06]Oh, he seems to understand that.
[103:35.44]Okay.
[103:37.93]Looking healthy.
[103:38.45]What do we got for another battle?
[103:40.17]I think it's time for an official tournament.
[103:41.63]What do you say?
[103:43.37]This one right here.
[103:44.37]Shrine League.
[103:45.31]Uh-huh.
[103:46.35]We'll... We'll get him nice and trained up by then.
[103:54.88]Light Learn?
[103:58.82]It's worthy to install it.
[104:03.95]How do you fill this?
[104:07.01]It works great on Windows 10.
[104:09.30]Developers thought about it when they made it.
[104:13.38]Wait, developers made the game to work on, like, every operating system?
[104:25.06]Imagine future-proofing your game that far into the future in 1997.
[104:28.68]I don't know, guys.
[104:31.66]We've got a future-proof Lego island.
[104:36.36]No, I didn't want to do trampoline.
[104:37.56]I didn't even do it.
[104:48.27]Can you play Putt-Putt Goes to the Zoo?
[104:50.05]Already did.
[104:54.52]I did the Putt-Putt stream already.
[104:57.00]We played like four of them at the same time.
[105:00.12]Or whatever I did.
[105:05.16]Hey, your birthday's tomorrow.
[105:07.91]Valuki!
[105:09.01]Valuki, happy birthday, dude.
[105:13.25]Thanks, Valuki.
[105:13.89]Happy birthday, dude.
[105:14.59]Let's get more intelligence.
[105:15.35]That sounds good.
[105:15.95]Yeah, sure.
[105:41.81]My birthday's tomorrow, too.
[105:42.79]Hey, happy birthday, Cougar.
[106:00.50]Get it right.
[106:02.22]Finally.
[106:02.72]Great job this time.
[106:04.60]Now I just need his intelligence to move.
[106:13.52]Praise him.
[106:14.60]Praise him.
[106:17.52]Your birthday's in November?
[106:18.48]Hey, dude, happy birthday, man.
[106:20.56]Your birthday's tomorrow, Simba?
[106:21.81]Hey, happy birthday tomorrow, Simba, dude.
[106:23.89]Happy birthday, definitely not, Jeremiah.
[106:25.39]Your birthday's tomorrow?
[106:26.23]Happy birthday, man.
[106:30.07]Alright.
[106:31.31]Time to spend some money.
[106:34.43]Expensive RanRan time.
[106:38.04]We're doing RanRan extract.
[106:40.74]Yeah.
[106:41.50]We are just going to stick it in the vein.
[106:45.16]You know what I mean?
[106:47.29]Happy birthday, man.
[106:48.09]Happy birthday, Locky.
[106:51.07]Do it.
[106:59.73]Here we go.
[107:03.36]Let me know if you want to quit.
[107:04.60]Nope.
[107:07.34]We did the hardest possible drug.
[107:09.66]Over here.
[107:10.52]Got it.
[107:12.72]investigate give me give me give me oh yeah free power more over here there's some weird log over here do you want to search this yes what the was that
[107:41.15]It's like Winnie the Pooh Mushroom Chef.
[107:43.47]It's Garfield.
[107:45.27]A huge lord monster appeared.
[107:48.99]Well, that scared me.
[107:50.05]Well, this is the first time I've seen a lord monster.
[107:55.69]If you give a lord a pretty stone called a skill item, they will teach you a new skill in return.
[108:01.46]This monster is probably the lord of this area.
[108:03.94]Jeremy, if you ever find a pretty skill item stone, come back here with it.
[108:09.89]A monster can only learn four skills at a time.
[108:14.74]If a monster learns more than four, it has to forget one.
[108:16.90]Do you want me to repeat that?
[108:19.94]No.
[108:20.10]Alright, so I need to bring a skill item back here.
[108:28.90]Okay, so... I gotta come back to the weird flower.
[108:33.91]Skill item?
[108:38.23]Nope.
[108:41.86]I got plenty of time.
[108:42.50]Let's go.
[108:48.50]Shit.
[108:51.54]We need to take the Lord's Soul.
[108:53.01]I'm gonna go turn it in for a terrible weapon that has no stats.
[109:09.65]Yeah, so I think we found something.
[109:15.40]Boker?
[109:17.77]We found a guy in a bush.
[109:19.57]Okay.
[109:19.87]I don't understand this.
[109:26.45]God damn it.
[109:33.09]This is gonna stop my adventure, isn't it?
[109:35.80]Oh, come on.
[109:39.89]glasses on who the fuck is this dog librarian give me a break please oh my lord stay back shit bounce him bounce him
[110:08.62]I have to follow this up with another hit.
[110:10.32]Come on.
[110:10.60]Why is there a time limit on this?
[110:14.12]Of all things, they have a time limit on this.
[110:16.28]He's dizzy.
[110:16.76]Good.
[110:18.32]Back him up.
[110:19.28]He can't do anything back here.
[110:23.57]Give me those glasses.
[110:24.77]Come on.
[110:25.79]Finish it.
[110:26.81]Finish him here.
[110:29.37]Finish it.
[110:30.99]Oh, bounce him.
[110:32.43]Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.
[110:33.81]Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.
[110:37.54]Alright, we're getting those glasses.
[110:38.64]So what happens now?
[110:57.15]Can we get anything for that?
[111:01.07]Hopefully those glasses are a skill item.
[111:05.39]Good job, I'm proud of you.
[111:09.59]No, that's nothing.
[111:10.57]I just lost... Look at how... I just lost so much skill for no reason.
[111:20.40]Oh, you found a fruit.
[111:25.88]What is left?
[111:26.46]Yeah, I think I've already been over here.
[111:28.04]Yeah, I've been here before.
[111:36.62]Wow.
[111:37.38]You found something shiny.
[111:38.91]You found a... That's so disappointing.
[111:51.07]It's only 100 gold.
[111:54.47]Pretty flower.
[111:56.34]You did it.
[111:57.58]Is it a skill item?
[112:09.95]I'm not a fan of that.
[112:11.53]I don't know if I like that.
[112:12.45]It feels too random.
[112:17.79]Have some more mushrooms.
[112:31.15]It didn't like that.
[112:32.05]Whatever.
[112:36.71]let him rest try to do the official tournament coming up ran ran random yeah pay attention to nutrition didn't somebody tell me that I had to feed him mushrooms because I'm in the mushroom area and that's how I can learn a mushroom thing
[113:02.12]I was told specifically to feed him mushrooms.
[113:05.44]Like, every time.
[113:06.16]Because then he'll turn into another monster.
[113:09.83]That's the data that I've been told.
[113:11.19]What's that coming up?
[113:18.23]Right here.
[113:19.07]Rest.
[113:21.24]Train one more time and rest.
[113:23.60]I was told that because there's no... There's no fusion in this game, that you have to... That is correct!
[113:30.24]23Skidoo told me that was correct!
[113:41.09]That was a lot of power.
[113:46.60]Rest, and then we'll try to win the tournament.
[113:49.36]Region-specific traits.
[113:50.40]Right?
[113:51.76]Yeah.
[113:52.94]I trust you, 23Skidoo.
[113:56.42]One guy.
[113:56.84]I trust the one guy.
[114:02.04]Save it, rest, and then battle.
[114:07.11]I'm putting a lot of trust into this guy.
[114:09.87]Yeah, that's fine.
[114:15.89]Battle.
[114:18.38]Is right there.
[114:21.88]Sleep.
[114:29.87]Fight.
[114:33.31]Here's the tournament.
[114:35.66]Full of energy.
[114:37.06]He's doing alright.
[114:40.36]And enter the Dropbox tournament.
[114:43.74]How many files can you upload in 20 minutes?
[114:54.01]If you can't fuse monsters, why are they called breeders?
[114:58.43]That's a really good question.
[115:09.60]go for the top drop top versus komodo just default t-rex shouldn't be a problem it's not going to be and I say that I say that now but who knows let's build up a little bit of guts first
[115:41.27]good Pokémon battle music.
[115:44.66]It's got high defense.
[115:46.78]It's alright.
[115:47.20]Fall back a little bit.
[115:49.86]Mm-hmm.
[115:55.32]Mm-hmm.
[115:56.99]Dizzy.
[116:03.61]How can you be dizzy and still dodge that?
[116:07.41]I don't know.
[116:09.84]My speed is so bad, I really need to work on it.
[116:13.56]I'm gonna be so useless without it.
[116:21.65]For fuck's sake, come on.
[116:28.70]My stats are so much better.
[116:29.92]Ehhhhhhh.
[116:37.14]10 seconds to figure it out.
[116:38.36]I gotta go.
[116:39.17]Gotta hit him again.
[116:39.79]Win by percentage.
[116:41.65]Don't hit me with that.
[116:44.39]You're gonna get lucky and get the... Come on, hurry up.
[116:46.17]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[116:46.97]Good.
[116:47.21]Last second.
[116:47.63]If I hit this, I win.
[116:52.38]I would've won by percentage.
[116:54.52]Maybe I wouldn't have.
[116:55.88]Would've been close.
[117:03.99]Who's the shitty blob?
[117:09.18]Look, I know we had the perfect monster in Beanbag Sonic.
[117:14.76]But we have to move on.
[117:18.80]We have a new dog.
[117:21.08]You know?
[117:22.04]We got a new pet.
[117:23.94]We have a new friend.
[117:24.76]Let's see the data on... Jimmy's the... The, uh... The Quix rabbit, right?
[117:37.53]Yeah.
[117:39.44]Terrible defense.
[117:40.30]Really good speed, though.
[117:41.12]Okay.
[117:41.38]Alright.
[117:52.09]Let's get, uh, let's get Nesquik.
[117:57.03]Let's put way too much powder in the milk and it's all fucking soupy.
[118:00.61]That's how I like to drink it.
[118:02.31]Good dodge.
[118:05.08]I like to put a layer of the powder on the top of the milk and eat it off with a spoon.
[118:08.88]It's a soggy, sandy, crunchy, weird taste to it.
[118:13.39]I love it.
[118:22.39]Come on.
[118:30.62]Yeah, watch me.
[118:32.04]Just watch me do a wicked fucked up ratio.
[118:35.18]We're talking like 2 to 1 powder to milk.
[118:37.84]Then you Ster it up and it turns into sludge and you can barely even lift your spoon up.
[118:42.57]It's almost like soft serve ice cream at that point, but it's full of sand.
[118:45.35]Uh, let's... He has so much more guts than me.
[118:52.84]Although, he's not really doing much.
[118:57.38]Okay, I actually do need to hit him now.
[118:59.36]I don't want him to win by some stupid ratio.
[119:03.78]He's going to beat me with a 2 to 1 ratio here.
[119:07.34]I'm the milk.
[119:08.66]I'm the fucking milk.
[119:09.58]And he gets the last laugh.
[119:10.78]Good.
[119:11.40]Nice.
[119:11.92]I get to be the milk this time.
[119:13.50]Don't even fucking tell me.
[119:15.72]Thank God.
[119:16.34]It was just barely 60% milk to 51% Nesquik.
[119:21.07]I made it.
[119:30.41]Exactly how I would have made it.
[119:36.11]Who's this?
[119:38.33]Canap?
[119:39.71]No, it's this machine gun guy.
[119:41.01]This guy sucks.
[119:41.87]I'll win.
[119:46.72]Two-thirds mayo, one-third ketchup.
[119:48.30]Eat with fries.
[119:48.94]Thank me later.
[119:49.56]You forgot to add the Tabasco sauce, man.
[119:53.40]Tabasco, ketchup with a little bit of mayonnaise.
[119:57.54]Thank me in a minute.
[119:59.26]Everyone has French fries in front of them right now.
[120:01.01]I refuse to believe that you don't.
[120:03.67]Shake him.
[120:05.48]I don't know what that means.
[120:09.40]It just means I have less power, it seems.
[120:28.44]I'm gonna hold back until I'm not shaken anymore.
[120:30.36]Let's just see if I can stay.
[120:31.64]Machine gun doesn't do that much damage.
[120:35.38]I did block it, so that's good.
[120:39.22]My milk.
[120:39.74]Shaken, not stirred.
[120:43.66]I don't even like to drink milk.
[120:46.26]Not anymore.
[120:47.00]I used to.
[120:51.52]Can I please hit him?
[120:57.88]Finally.
[120:58.22]Alright, I gotta be careful, because... I don't want to fuck up his ratio.
[121:06.54]Like, he's got, like, nuts and shit, and I don't want to fuck up the milk ratio here.
[121:14.15]That should be it.
[121:15.21]That should be fine.
[121:16.49]Yeah.
[121:17.67]Good to go.
[121:28.53]You add coffee grinds and ranch dressing to your French fries.
[121:34.27]That sounds like something I would never do in my whole life.
[121:38.82]Thanks for the Tabasco tip.
[121:41.30]You can put Tabasco on anything and it makes it taste good.
[121:44.66]Tabasco is my favorite condiment.
[121:46.40]I love that stuff.
[121:48.88]And don't give me this Sriracha bullshit.
[121:53.80]Sriracha is... It just tastes like somebody...
[121:57.58]took a decent hot sauce, added sugar to it, and then strained garlic into it, and then left it outside for like two days.
[122:07.80]To a point where it just barely got rotten, and then they put it into the fridge.
[122:11.86]Get that out of here.
[122:12.94]I only want fucking pure, mashed up peppers and white wine vinegar.
[122:20.25]You know what I'm saying?
[122:22.25]That's it.
[122:22.65]No, no nonsense.
[122:24.11]Peppers and white wine vinegar.
[122:27.42]That's all I want and my hot sauce.
[122:31.46]Who am I fighting?
[122:31.98]Let's see.
[122:35.74]Let's see.
[122:36.00]Tabasco ingredients.
[122:43.35]Yeah.
[122:44.07]There's absolutely no nonsense at all.
[122:47.87]By the way, I'm pretty sure we can win.
[122:56.16]Tabasco's gross?
[122:57.38]What are you talking about?
[123:01.70]Cholula?
[123:02.18]I like Cholula, but Cholula is good on tacos.
[123:04.24]I don't want to put Cholula on a slice of pizza.
[123:06.05]You understand?
[123:15.19]Now that's what I'm talking about.
[123:24.17]Cheese it versus cheese nips debate.
[123:29.37]Cholula is good.
[123:31.79]But it's not... I wouldn't put it on a piece of pizza.
[123:34.61]Hot sauce on pizza.
[123:35.41]Yeah.
[123:40.57]Cholula on tuna.
[123:42.67]That's actually pretty good.
[123:43.79]I would eat that.
[123:44.95]Absolutely.
[123:45.37]That sounds great.
[123:54.00]And he's got one HP.
[123:55.14]Let's see if we can just kill him.
[124:00.99]Win the tournament, please.
[124:02.41]Sorry, I just coughed up a little bit of Tabasco there.
[124:11.00]That's a tournament victory.
[124:14.16]Good to go.
[124:15.20]Good to go.
[124:31.65]Wait, did we not beat somebody yet?
[124:32.99]No, Galaha.
[124:35.12]The next match is against Gadamon.
[124:37.98]Yeah, we fought this dumb dog.
[124:42.08]Although, that's a lot of speed.
[124:45.22]Okay, you've improved, it seems.
[124:48.85]Terrible defense, though.
[124:51.47]Need to just land a move.
[124:59.57]Put Tabasco in your beer?
[125:03.11]I don't know if I want to do that.
[125:08.88]Tabasco on hit or pre-recorded.
[125:13.48]I want to go to the Tabasco plant.
[125:15.38]Where is it?
[125:15.72]Louisiana?
[125:20.72]Jump the gun on that one.
[125:23.38]He's got level 2 moves.
[125:26.12]He still sucks.
[125:36.42]He's just gonna hit me with like five to ten damage, and I'm gonna miss every single attack.
[125:42.46]Of course I am.
[125:48.61]Put Tabasco up your nose, it makes you feel incredibly powerful.
[125:54.31]What are you talking about?
[125:55.39]Wow, I feel so powerful!
[126:04.42]Running out of time here.
[126:06.42]Come on.
[126:06.96]Give me a hit.
[126:08.90]There we go.
[126:11.54]Stay in his face.
[126:12.58]This should be a victory as long as... As long as I can just keep it up.
[126:24.35]No!
[126:24.71]Stop dancing!
[126:25.31]Not yet.
[126:28.25]Alright, that's a victory.
[126:34.62]No, I'm not going to do a Tabasco.
[126:36.12]Oh, put Tabasco up your nose.
[126:39.80]Drop Tabasco in your ears.
[126:41.08]You can feel it in your brain.
[126:45.92]It makes you think colors.
[126:52.73]Yeah, man, put some Tabasco in your ear.

[127:42.87]What the fuck?
[127:47.53]Oh, it's interesting.
[127:48.59]Blue sounds like the intro to every Daft Punk song I've ever heard.

[127:56.67]What does green sound like?

[134:00.89]But it's not blue.
[134:06.75]Black?
[134:08.27]It's fucking purple.
[134:15.21]The sound's not even fucking on!

[135:35.61]Yeah, we won the tournament, though.
[135:36.57]That's a good thing.
[135:47.68]I'm so mad.
[135:49.82]I did it.
[135:57.80]I forgot how to close Corrupt.
[135:59.08]No, I locked it on OBS accidentally for some reason.
[136:01.98]Because when I was clicking to turn the eyeball off, I clicked the...
[136:06.23]padlock here are the results yeah what color is this song now that song is definitely I would call that red what color is this music
[136:35.91]I would call this song green, for sure.
[136:38.75]This is a green song.
[136:41.89]I picture, who's that funny little elf guy from Zelda?
[136:49.04]Tinkle?
[136:51.54]Mr. Tinkles, whatever his name is, the guy with the funny, he like spins around and he's like wearing a green man suit.
[136:59.80]No, not Peter Pan.
[137:07.39]Let's give him some bone-in meat.
[137:12.71]Yeah, let's give him some bone-in meat.
[137:17.37]Tingle.
[137:18.17]Alright.
[137:21.96]Agree or disagree?
[137:23.14]Tingle is the Jar Jar Binks of the Zelda universe.
[137:28.14]Agree?
[137:28.66]Like, I'm... What are you... By a show of hands.
[137:38.49]Somebody's here.
[137:39.07]Hi.

[137:41.35]We've been training a monster here.
[137:45.36]Hmm.
[137:45.86]I'm Michio.
[137:47.82]I'm training around here too.
[137:51.80]How long have you been training?
[137:53.18]I can't wait for... Because here's the thing about the new Smash Bros.
[137:55.82]coming out on Switch.
[137:56.62]They fucking ran out of characters.
[137:59.68]So you guys are going to get to see a chef in the next Switch Smash Bros.
[138:05.90]And Tingle's going to be a playable character.
[138:09.07]What's he gonna put in that game?
[138:13.49]You guys are gonna start to get like shop owners at this point Goku
[138:39.38]Let's win this one.
[138:40.23]Do I have to fight?
[138:43.49]Boss baby.
[138:49.69]Tingle actually had... Yeah, but who the fuck wants to tingle in that game?
[138:52.68]This guy's fast.
[138:55.02]He's very fast.
[139:07.40]You are way more- We gotta get lucky here.
[139:14.67]Take that.
[139:18.45]Pogo Punch.
[139:21.40]Speaking of Mario characters, you just did Luigi's forward-run attack move in Smash Bros.
[139:27.72]They can hear us.
[139:33.40]What does it say?
[139:34.92]What does it say?
[139:39.95]Hawaiian?
[139:41.03]Number one?
[139:41.87]What the hell was that move?
[139:43.13]Hawaiian?
[139:44.15]Do that again.
[139:46.39]Do the... What was that?
[139:49.58]Hawaii?
[139:50.42]Do it again.
[139:51.26]I want to see it again.
[139:55.30]I can see it too loudly.
[140:05.16]Alright, I've turned it down.
[140:09.33]Big uppercut.
[140:09.89]Yeah, but honestly, how many... They always have at least, what, 10, 15 newcomers to smash?
[140:27.27]Okay, you got split who's who's even let's talk about Splatoon kid right is gonna be a character Splatoon character the little squid people, right?
[140:38.11]There's one Tingle is to Toad is another one.
[140:47.61]You're gonna get that you're gonna get two toads.
[140:49.19]You're gonna get tingle and toad is playable characters.
[140:51.39]Oh
[141:00.93]Who else?
[141:03.15]Waluigi?
[141:03.72]Another joke character?
[141:12.40]Don't say that.
[141:13.14]Well, it was nice meeting you.
[141:19.16]She made us her rival.
[141:28.11]Waluigi isn't a joke.
[141:29.83]No, no, no, of course he's not.
[141:31.55]They just had no content for him at all.
[141:34.17]So when they put him in Smash, they gave him a tennis racket based on what he uses in one of the party games that they ham-fisted him into.
[141:44.54]But yeah, he's a fully developed character.
[141:46.50]Give him a tennis racket from Mario Tennis.
[141:54.24]Go to bed.
[141:57.42]I almost just called him Bloobadoo.
[141:59.44]That was a better name.
[142:12.25]Showing no respect for purple Luigi.
[142:19.81]That was his first game?
[142:21.57]Oh god, what an awful first game.
[142:25.21]What a terrible- wasn't your first game was Mario Tennis?
[142:31.37]You don't even get to be- your first name doesn't even get to be in the title.
[142:34.27]It's somebody that's cooler than you's name in the title.
[142:37.60]That wasn't Waluigi Tennis.
[142:51.52]Mario Tennis is a good game.
[142:52.90]I'm just saying.
[142:53.62]The origins of Waluigi being that's his first game.
[142:56.44]I mean, come on.
[143:00.58]I don't want to get out of here, person.
[143:08.91]But Purple Luigi says why it's funny.
[143:12.19]So does Wario.
[143:15.51]Wario also says why.
[143:23.54]Yeah, he goes like, right?
[143:25.54]Like Wario.
[143:26.84]Let's see.
[143:27.88]Wario.
[143:29.14]Wow.
[143:32.20]That's where it came from.
[143:34.93]Oh, that's so bad.
[143:40.17]I'm sorry.
[143:40.51]See?
[143:41.33]I can't even hear this.
[143:46.59]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[143:52.77]I thought this was just a what's up commercial from Budweiser.
[143:56.79]Alright, yeah, it really is.
[144:08.18]What's up?
[144:11.48]See, I told you.
[144:17.32]They already made that character.
[144:18.45]They just stretched him out and recolored his clothes.
[144:33.04]They're really going at it.
[144:40.24]Ay, ay, ay.
[144:47.12]Jesus Christ.
[144:50.22]When's the next tournament?
[144:55.97]Wario's a better character than Luigi?
[144:59.04]um let's try this one let's do let's raise his power a little bit and then do this I think I don't know in my opinion they made a mistake making luigi like four years old
[145:22.12]Because you've got Super Mario, who's already kind of childlike in his demeanor, in the way... Mario is essentially a video game Elmo.
[145:31.37]Like, in the way that he talks.
[145:33.65]Listen to it.
[145:35.15]You know, like... That's Elmo.
[146:00.00]Let's do this turn.
[146:19.78]How did I make that make sense?
[146:21.88]Because look at what they're both trying to do!
[146:28.98]They both have similar patterns of speech.
[146:37.22]Listen to Elmo say a sentence, and then listen to Mario say a sentence.
[146:43.73]I'll give you a hint.
[146:44.51]It's like... Hi, Poison Curls!
[146:48.01]Let's-a go!
[146:49.49]And then Mario's like... Let's-a go!
[146:54.61]They're the same person.
[146:55.61]They're the exact same speaking dialect.
[147:08.44]And guess what?
[147:09.24]They both refer to themselves in the third person.
[147:18.03]Who else does that?
[147:19.31]Oh, it's me, Mario!
[147:21.01]Oh, Mario time!
[147:22.29]Mario!
[147:23.49]It's the same fucking character, and they're both red!
[147:49.67]The first person, whatever.
[147:50.97]They both like say their name.
[148:05.85]I need to win this.
[148:08.23]Win it!
[148:08.79]I gotta do percentages, percentages!
[148:10.51]I think I lost by percentages.
[148:14.73]Nope.
[148:15.21]What am I talking about?
[148:15.91]That was a huge victory.
[148:22.78]Video game conspiracy theorist.
[148:24.54]Yeah, and both their names end in O.
[148:39.02]Oh, man.
[148:39.58]Does that person's name cuts zero?
[148:46.11]That's an edgy name for a fighting monster.
[148:48.09]We're going up against Bologna.
[148:53.95]Let's see.
[148:54.59]Speed.
[148:56.93]Stay away from intelligence moves.
[148:58.63]Actually, no.
[148:59.58]Stay away from power.
[149:00.92]My defense should be okay.
[149:02.98]I think that'll move.
[149:06.00]Not great.
[149:16.61]Suezo Beam.
[149:17.48]Oh, no.
[149:19.78]Okay, make sure I don't get hit by that one again.
[149:28.50]I don't know about this one.
[149:33.39]Hmm.
[149:34.29]It's going to take a lot to come back from this, though.
[149:39.55]I mean, it's still technically possible.
[149:42.27]I just have to get two or three hits in a row.
[149:44.23]Hmm.
[149:44.89]Hmm.
[149:48.09]Oh god, no, it's over.
[149:49.59]I'm gonna get Swayzo'd.
[149:51.08]Yeah, see you later.
[149:51.74]That's it.
[149:57.16]How do I beat this thing?
[149:57.88]You gotta level up.
[150:00.26]I need another move, but the way you learn moves in this game is just so... It just doesn't make any sense.
[150:05.25]You have to eat certain foods and run around drunk at night, looking in bushes.
[150:19.49]Alright, we're going up against, uh... We've fought this guy before.
[150:31.11]Just like in real life.
[150:37.87]Um... Okay.
[150:44.30]Really?
[150:44.56]Right off the bat?
[150:48.64]That sucked.
[150:50.44]That's just reverse drill.
[150:51.58]Remember when we had that cool move on that character we used?
[150:58.50]It's Parappa the Rapper.
[151:02.80]Yeah, that does look like Parappa the Rapper's friend.
[151:05.82]Or Parappa the Rapper character.
[151:06.86]We get the move stone from free tournaments.
[151:16.63]You know, we made the joke that he was a DJ dog, but he just... he's doing that now.
[151:21.95]It's actually one of his moves.
[151:25.58]Okay.
[151:26.82]I guess so.
[151:34.96]No, don't do that again.
[151:41.67]Still okay.
[151:43.41]One more hit and that should solidify it.
[151:47.67]Not good.
[151:49.89]I'm literally shaking.
[151:53.29]This has to hit.
[151:55.18]No, please.
[152:02.72]Still one.
[152:08.21]Am I going to play Monster Rancher Evo?
[152:10.29]Probably not Evo, because I heard Evo is the worst one.
[152:16.30]From my understanding, it was stay away from Evo, because it's bad.
[152:25.24]Well, we can try this again.
[152:26.24]We just have to stay away from that Suezo move.
[152:35.58]This is the worst one.
[152:42.17]Really.
[152:44.89]Interesting.
[152:52.23]What's my favorite Monster Rancher breed?
[152:53.73]Uh, the wall.
[152:56.53]Come on.
[153:01.25]You can do Scratch for all I care.
[153:02.93]No, you can't.
[153:03.41]That's a lot of damage.
[153:08.89]Work together and be friends.
[153:17.12]Perfect.
[153:19.16]Dizzy.
[153:23.99]Even with Dizzy.
[153:32.07]Come on.
[153:35.77]Ah!
[153:35.83]No!
[153:36.01]Dodge it!
[153:37.49]Yes!
[153:41.97]Jupiter Raid?
[153:42.63]What's with the Jupiter Raids?
[153:43.64]What's going on here?
[153:48.04]Why is there a Jupiter Raid going on?
[153:52.89]Shit.
[153:53.31]Nah, I lose.
[153:53.77]I don't think there's any coming back from this one.
[153:56.71]And why do these guys already have like two or three moves each?
[154:03.28]Did your weird spiritual guide show you the way too?
[154:05.60]Because I can't get another move.
[154:21.23]Just trying to save some seagulls man Alright, is it time for me to go on a search again or something Uh, do you want to say something to drop top you tried
[154:52.86]You tried.
[154:53.22]Alright, give him some more mushrooms.
[155:05.25]Oh, come on.
[155:05.59]Why are you guys spamming my, like, seven emotes?
[155:13.54]Go to bed.
[155:20.24]Go back to 2.
[155:22.20]I actually do like 2 a lot more.
[155:25.55]2 was a lot more fun for me.
[155:31.11]Not giving up on this one yet, though.
[155:34.35]Let me see what we got.
[155:37.54]It's an official D tournament, but I'm definitely not ready.
[155:42.92]Feed us emotes.
[155:47.56]Can I go on another one of those weird dream sequences again?
[156:00.67]Got it.
[156:03.59]This one has less annoying music and umbrella slime.
[156:09.15]Yeah, but I like the game of Monster Rancher 1 and 2 more than this.
[156:16.55]Monster Rancher 2 was more fun, I think.
[156:23.42]This one feels, like, messy and hidden.
[156:27.50]It's almost like you... Because if you... You could make money in Monster Rancher 1 and 2, and spend the money to try to get skills.
[156:36.12]In this one, it's almost like you kind of have to guess.
[156:41.89]No fusing either?
[156:42.75]What kind of... Come on.
[156:44.47]No fusing?
[156:45.33]I can't fuse monsters?
[156:46.43]That's half the fun.
[156:53.74]I can get an Aurora Stone here.
[156:55.12]I'm going to try to win this.
[156:59.08]This is eight people in this tournament, though.
[157:03.32]Let's try to win the Aurora Stone.
[157:11.12]Let's do some power.
[157:14.28]You know, yeah, we could go back and try some more DVDs.
[157:22.77]Become a Monster Rancher 2 streamer.
[157:32.93]Do we have any items?
[157:36.14]How hard is it to win this tournament?
[157:42.59]Don't win any money, but I want next... If I win this, and then I can go... This tournament lets anybody enter regardless of rank, so we may encounter monsters that are very powerful.
[157:52.84]Uh, no.
[157:55.80]That's a guaranteed loss.
[158:01.88]Snake Emblem?
[158:02.70]Are there any other items coming up at all?
[158:06.77]White Ribbon.
[158:10.10]No, I don't know.
[158:11.20]I'm not gonna go do that.
[158:15.04]I'm gonna go lose to a guy.
[158:18.11]No balls?
[158:19.65]Fine.
[158:20.95]Let's just go get our ass kicked.
[158:23.45]And probably die.
[158:24.31]Alright, I got a question for you Monster Rancher enthusiasts here.
[158:34.38]How is 4 in comparison?
[158:38.78]Is 4 improve on some of these mechanics, or is 4 just another 3 with extra content?
[158:44.86]Should we just move right on to fucking Evo?
[158:49.19]You know what I'm saying?
[158:55.63]4 is okay.
[158:56.17]2 is the best.
[158:57.91]Bad.
[159:00.93]It's better.
[159:01.29]4 is amazing.
[159:01.95]4 is supposed to be better.
[159:05.35]Okay, let's go.
[159:05.93]It's versus Galay.
[159:07.43]Let's see.
[159:08.27]Oh, yeah, this was a good idea.
[159:10.47]I'm glad I decided to do this.
[159:15.41]This was a smart idea.
[159:16.49]Move on to four.
[159:26.02]Can you fuse monsters in four?
[159:30.96]Did they bring that back at least?
[159:39.17]Watch me accidentally win this somehow.
[159:45.85]Yes, you can fuse in four.
[159:58.75]Well, I think... Slop Top, what's his name?
[160:03.88]See, that's how I get... No, I'm not even invested.
[160:06.18]I don't even remember this guy's name.
[160:08.87]I was about to call him Pizza Box.
[160:12.20]No, it's Drop Top.
[160:13.60]What's his name?
[160:14.34]I don't know his name.
[160:15.12]I don't even care about this monster at all.
[160:24.90]Slop Top.
[160:27.46]That's how you know you're not invested.
[160:32.52]Give me a lucky crit.
[160:40.61]Throw him in the trash.
[160:47.53]We can.
[160:51.30]Well, he's done.
[160:53.34]He turned into a melted snowman.
[161:01.24]Let's go make some more monsters.
[161:02.28]Let's go put some discs in.
[161:06.62]But yes, we're going to move on to 4.
[161:11.76]This one's not itching me like the other ones were.
[161:13.56]We'll see if 4 does the same thing.
[161:18.60]Do I need to fight everybody or can I just forfeit, please?
[161:20.54]Oh, that's it.
[161:27.15]It was a single elimination.
[161:35.71]Next game?
[161:37.97]Should we just move the fuck on to Monster Ranch for 4?
[161:41.25]I don't have Monster Rancher 4.
[161:46.47]I have to get it.
[161:47.81]These games are expensive.
[161:50.94]The one thing I can tell you about Monster Rancher, buying them on Amazon, is by golly, these are not cheap.
[162:00.62]How much is Monster Rancher 4 right now?
[162:03.08]Oh, that's out there.
[162:04.03]Don't worry.
[162:05.41]It's only $1,000.
[162:11.56]oh yeah it's a thousand bucks why is this a thousand dollars on Amazon okay it's two hundred dollars or a thousand dollars oh god damn it
[162:41.09]No.
[162:41.99]No, don't... No, it's not... We're not talking about donation train.
[162:45.43]No donation train.
[162:46.25]I'll tell you why.
[162:46.87]Because I don't... I'm not gonna see that money for like two months.
[162:50.32]So don't do it.
[162:52.98]That's not gonna... That's not worth it.
[162:54.48]Trust me.
[162:58.24]And I'm not gonna emulate it.
[162:59.18]I have a PlayStation 2 right here.
[163:07.19]Why is this fucking 200 bucks?
[163:10.78]Okay, hold on.
[163:11.24]There's used ones here.
[163:13.84]63 bucks used acceptable.
[163:16.00]Jesus Christ.
[163:16.95]Okay, well, alright, whatever.
[163:20.45]Yeah, there's a bunch of terrible used ones for like 50, 60 bucks.
[163:27.21]Why is this one so expensive?
[163:36.35]It's cheaper on eBay.
[163:37.35]Well, I'll get it.
[163:38.04]I'll find it.
[163:39.83]But Amazon Prime, man.
[163:41.61]Come on.
[163:42.01]I can get it in two days.
[163:46.01]Alright, let's go get shit-faced and find stuff in the woods.
[163:54.04]Is Evo on PS3 or PS2?
[163:57.90]Don't worry.
[163:58.34]We're not done with PlayStation 2.
[164:01.91]Because when I come back from PAX...
[164:05.27]Uh, the first thing we're doing when I come back from PAX is we're playing True Crime Streets of New York.
[164:12.63]That is a PlayStation 2 game that we're gonna play.
[164:15.25]And the first True Crime was fucking a blast.
[164:19.04]So, we got that ready to go.
[164:23.98]And I'm gonna blow all my money. ...
[164:36.43]Getting a developer coffee.
[164:40.03]Yeah, but I mean, like, holy shit, man.
[164:43.45]How could you have a conscience to sell that game for $984?
[164:46.77]You're a villain.
[164:50.51]You know what I mean?
[164:52.13]You are a villain at that point.
[164:55.32]You know it's available for fucking $100 somewhere else.
[164:59.16]Sweet chestnut.
[164:59.88]Good drop.
[165:01.38]You know what I'm saying?
[165:04.20]Like, you know...
[165:09.90]Oh, there's the noisy halls.
[165:11.24]Yeah, let's do a skill.
[165:12.02]I have to.
[165:12.64]No, I'm not nexting this game yet.
[165:17.94]Because this was 50 bucks too.
[165:19.48]This was like at least 40 something dollars and I bought it.
[165:21.88]So I want to get at least like three hours out of this game.
[165:28.54]New in the box?
[165:29.34]I don't give a shit.
[165:33.14]Does it do my laundry too?
[165:35.84]A thousand dollars for Monster Rancher 4.
[165:52.28]I don't even know where the fuck I'm going.
[165:56.30]That's the only other PS2 game I have right now, and I don't want to start that tonight.
[166:05.83]More skill training.
[166:08.69]Let's get this to level 2.
[166:09.49]Level up.
[166:20.64]Goddammit.
[166:22.79]We want Monster Rancher 2.
[166:27.15]You know what?
[166:27.51]I could just open up Monster Rancher 2 right now.
[166:30.89]And we could go back to training our weird snake person.
[166:47.48]Do it, please.
[166:49.30]Oh, Jesus, no.
[166:52.39]Yes!
[166:52.71]Holy shit!
[166:54.15]Oh my god, everybody hates this game.
[166:57.91]Oh man, why did I spend, like, 60 bucks on this?
[167:13.07]Uh, BB does not return, by the way.
[167:21.83]Some more sweet chestnuts.
[167:27.53]I mean, quadratic BBS is there.
[167:32.32]Sell it autographed.
[167:33.10]A black pearl, hold on.
[167:41.26]Can I use that for something?
[167:42.46]No.
[167:43.20]Let's go to Amazon and sell it for $500.
[167:50.82]Or, I mean, I could put in Dino Crisis.
[167:57.18]Alright, that's a... Yeah, I ain't feeling Monster Ranch 3.
[168:01.71]I'm just not.
[168:02.17]I'll be honest.
[168:07.21]They tried some new ideas here.
[168:09.46]Wait a second!
[168:10.22]Hold on a minute!
[168:11.00]Hold that phone.
[168:12.00]We just got a softer stone piece.
[168:19.04]Never mind, you need four of them.
[168:22.22]Of the same color.
[168:26.28]Never mind.
[168:26.66]You can hold twelve pieces.
[168:36.18]What- what do I- do I want- don't- don't explain.
[168:41.08]You've been teasing Dino Crisis for three weeks.
[168:46.62]That's true.
[169:01.48]Try looking up Beauty and the Beast on VHS.
[169:10.33]We could put a couple more DVDs in.
[169:15.53]Yeah, let's go put this guy in the fryer later and we'll try some of the others.
[169:25.02]Oh, you found an evil leech.
[169:26.52]Your power went down.
[169:33.82]I do not have a PO box.
[169:37.16]And it's probably... I probably never will have one.
[169:40.55]Now, don't worry.
[169:41.33]We're gonna... I promise you before this stream turns off that I will at least turn on Dino Crisis.
[169:47.29]Mm-hmm.
[169:52.19]You heard it here first.
[169:54.20]Streamer will turn on Dino Crisis.
[170:05.21]I'll just turn it on.
[170:07.47]I don't know how long I'm going to play it.
[170:08.71]I might just turn it off.
[170:18.38]I'm just trying to drain the time here.
[170:22.28]Why am I stuck in this no man's land?
[170:24.84]How do I get out of here?
[170:28.26]Ugh.
[170:29.40]Air.
[170:37.93]Oh, by the way, not that there's more people here.
[170:40.51]Uh, my plan for PAX.
[170:43.74]I'm gonna be at PAX.
[170:45.52]Sporadically.
[170:46.32]I don't have a badge, by the way.
[170:48.16]I don't have a fucking PAX badge.
[170:50.19]So let's get that out of the way, first of all.
[170:52.57]Second of all, I will be doing a meetup on Saturday.
[170:56.65]Saturday's gonna be my official, Hey, come in and say hello!
[171:03.46]Probably around, like, between, like, 4 and 5 o'clock.
[171:06.58]Somewhere in the lobby.
[171:07.76]At PAX.
[171:13.00]It's gonna be like creeping around, like crawling around the streets.
[171:26.57]Poverty lobby meetup.
[171:28.87]Oh god.
[171:29.49]Alright, let's just give him nuts and then we'll go back.
[171:37.11]Yeah, I agree.
[171:37.99]I agree with you guys.
[171:38.67]I agree.
[171:38.95]The magic's not here on this one.
[171:40.19]I agree.
[171:42.13]There was a lot of magic in the first two games.
[171:46.15]Man, I'm just not getting that magic here.
[171:52.64]Just give me a minute.
[171:53.76]I mean, like, let's turn it down.
[171:56.12]You can't go from maximum volume to zero.
[171:59.74]You have to slowly turn the dial gradually.
[172:06.45]You know, you can't just like, would you go from 0 to 100?
[172:09.85]No, you go from 0 to 10 to 30 to 40.
[172:11.63]60 to 50 to 20 to 10.
[172:20.05]Maybe if I had put my face on the mask.
[172:21.65]Yeah, it's too bad I don't have a PlayStation 2 camera.
[172:25.43]Let's save it and go back to town and try like one or two more discs and then see what we're gonna do.
[172:28.65]Let's go back to Red Dead Redemption.
[172:37.58]I feel like I beat the whole game.
[172:39.00]I beat all the DLC in Red Dead Redemption, too.
[172:42.70]Alright, go back.
[172:44.88]Move.
[172:45.24]I mean, maybe if I could go to the other areas, too, that'd be more interesting.
[172:52.90]I just... I don't see the direction.
[172:55.94]I don't understand the direction of this game.
[173:02.13]Maybe somebody grabs us here.
[173:06.70]You know?
[173:07.86]Maybe we put in a disk and all of a sudden... Wow.
[173:11.62]Stay on this game.
[173:12.42]We need to see it.
[173:13.00]We gotta see it through.
[173:13.86]You know?
[173:20.85]Don't play Monster Rancher 2.
[173:22.07]We already have 17 hours of looking at menus there.
[173:36.17]Oh, man.
[173:44.57]That's me.
[173:44.87]I don't know why this made me laugh so much, but it is.
[173:47.76]Yes, I'd like to put it in a saucer stone.
[173:49.48]Alright, Meet the Fockers is going in.
[173:54.88]Please insert Meet the Fockers.
[174:05.34]Finish last light.
[174:06.28]Oh yeah, Metro last light I turned on for 25 minutes, got through the first tutorial and then couldn't complete the first, barely first mission of the game and got really frustrated and tired and annoyed and turned it off and I've never gone back since.
[174:22.77]Oh, that was raising my hand.
[174:23.83]There you go, meet the Fockers.
[174:29.41]Classic, classic movie.
[174:35.02]Alright, everyone wants me to leave this game, right?
[174:38.36]But what happens if Beanbag Sonic comes out of this disk?
[174:42.22]Am I staying and playing it?
[174:47.88]Yeah, I got a haircut.
[174:50.84]Yeah.
[174:52.04]It's a new me.
[174:52.78]New year, new me.
[174:54.20]One of my New Year's resolutions was to get a haircut.
[174:58.18]Took me like four months, but you know, whatever.
[175:02.84]Oh shit, what did I do wrong?
[175:04.24]I just, hold on.
[175:06.86]I opened that too early.
[175:07.64]Okay, there we go.
[175:09.46]I think I almost just like broke it, but that's fine.
[175:17.35]Four months late.
[175:19.45]Better late than never, as they say.
[175:25.69]Confirm.
[175:28.01]Alright.
[175:30.03]We're looking to get wowed here.
[175:32.66]If this is not at least a 9 out of 10 monster, we're going to move on.
[175:39.59]Play something else.
[175:51.64]Thanks for waiting.
[175:52.26]Behold the birth of a monster.
[175:53.28]Here he comes.
[176:00.95]What is it?
[176:13.39]What, is it a bunch of plates?
[176:15.65]The monster this saucer stone revives is a creature whose power is legendary.
[176:20.17]It has such high pride, it won't even listen to inexperienced breeders.
[176:24.13]You aren't ready yet.
[176:24.97]She's become strong enough to attain rank A. Perhaps I'll let you raise this one.
[176:33.47]Will you try another saucer stone?
[176:53.22]This is our last-ditch attempt.
[177:00.36]Gonna put in click.
[177:06.09]Yeah, he stole a legendary monster from us.
[177:07.89]That's not fair.
[177:08.45]That's kind of bullshit.
[177:11.71]Yeah, out of all the concepts to carry over, you carry over the dumb... How fun would it be to unlock a rare monster from Meet the Fockers, but you can't.
[177:24.04]Alright, come on, Sandler.
[177:34.45]This is a good movie.
[177:37.85]I don't know why everyone doesn't like it.
[177:39.25]That's a good movie.
[177:40.65]It was fun.
[177:42.41]It was worth a watch.
[177:43.87]You know what I'm saying?
[177:48.84]You tell me you didn't like that movie.
[177:51.59]It was fun.
[177:52.55]It was, well, what would you do if you had access to a time travel remote?
[177:57.11]No one's ever done that before.
[177:59.51]It's a genre that's never been touched upon.
[178:07.86]It was really actually pretty bad.
[178:09.90]I know.
[178:12.78]I know.
[178:14.32]It was awful.
[178:21.64]Okay.
[178:23.68]What do you got?
[178:35.57]This guy's so... I don't know, man.
[178:46.91]It's like a bird.
[178:48.33]It's a raiden.
[178:50.77]This monster never misses daily training.
[178:52.61]It does not bother with small things, thinking only about ways to become stronger.
[179:03.55]For somebody that talks a lot of shit about how strong you are, you sure are a weak, weak person.
[179:16.80]Will you take this monster home?
[179:18.28]Yeah, it's like a gorilla bird.
[179:19.82]Alright, hold on.
[179:20.46]We need a good name here.
[179:37.87]Use a seagull?
[179:42.37]No, that's like Falco in the medieval torture machine that pulls you apart.
[179:47.52]Stretchy Falco?
[179:52.16]Seagull?
[179:53.08]No.
[179:53.78]Alright, fine.
[179:54.44]How about... How about Stretchgull?
[180:00.51]What are some synonyms for stretch?
[180:02.63]What's a thesaurus?
[180:03.27]Somebody get a thesaurus out here.
[180:06.27]Stretch.
[180:09.97]Stretch, um...
[180:14.99]Extend out stretch outreach Elastigull mm-hmm perfect good thing.
[180:25.80]We're not gonna use them.
[180:26.48]I'm gonna just delete this whole game Then we can bring them to the next one Elastigull Elastigull is a good name.
[180:35.40]I Don't think it fits Elastigull
[180:43.66]That's another thing.
[180:44.38]What's with the fucking name?
[180:45.97]Elastigoo.
[180:48.21]Swolgull?
[180:53.67]Elastgull.
[180:58.84]Chewy bird?
[181:02.16]Swolgull.
[181:03.04]Okay, no, that's... Elastigull.
[181:10.77]That really is like some shitty Pokémon name.
[181:13.59]Elastigull.
[181:18.45]Elastigull.
[181:20.18]Elastigull.
[181:21.64]Elastigull.
[181:23.56]That doesn't work.
[181:30.19]Testicle.
[181:32.52]No, there's nothing to do with the character that has absolutely nothing to do with his demeanor Nothing to do with the way that he looks the way that he acts not testicle That has it doesn't have like a big dick hanging out or anything or like a nutsack look How do you see a fucking nutsack here?
[181:53.14]Do you see a nutsack here look at him oh
[181:56.70]Do you see this?
[181:57.92]I don't see anything.
[181:58.66]I don't see a reason to name him fucking Ballsack Bird, whatever you wanted to call him.
[182:23.76]It wasn't there.
[182:26.54]I can't.
[182:26.92]You know, it doesn't even matter.
[182:27.82]I'm gonna name him Testicle.
[182:30.94]Can't even fit.
[182:33.52]Yes, it can.
[182:34.36]God damn it, it fits perfectly.
[182:40.82]Fine.
[182:41.32]Testicle.
[182:42.04]That's fine.
[182:42.72]That's good.
[182:43.90]We aren't even gonna fucking use this guy.
[182:53.99]Why do they just do that?
[183:08.74]Hybridate this guy.
[183:09.64]We'll do one more disk and then we'll bring these guys over to Monster Rancher 4.
[183:13.66]Put him to sleep.
[183:20.72]Try one more disk.
[183:27.53]I'm gonna do the greatest Boston movie ever made.
[183:30.51]The fucking Departed, dude.
[183:36.31]Let's try this one and that's it.
[183:38.92]I gotta get more DVDs before I generate.
[183:46.80]Revive from a saucer stone.
[183:48.47]Yes.
[183:49.51]Why do they call it something different every time?
[183:52.15]Isn't it the same universe?
[183:53.25]The Monster Hunter Rancher universe is the same thing.
[183:55.73]Why call it something different?
[183:59.49]Keep it consistent, goddammit.
[184:03.63]Come on in here.
[184:04.51]Bit about it.
[184:18.19]can't you just use the same movies for this one that you do in 4 yeah but that's no fun you gotta have brand new DVDs like I mean I was in the store and I bought a bunch of just like shitty dumb DVDs some of these are good movies but there's one back The Passion of the Christ is back there I just didn't put it on stream I like thought no it's probably not gonna be funny it's just there
[184:45.76]It's back there.
[184:48.54]You know.
[184:49.48]Just figured it wasn't going to touch that with a 10-foot pole.
[184:52.14]You know what I'm saying?
[185:02.33]Use only Adam Sandler movies.
[185:04.03]Do it.
[185:04.31]I think we need to save that for... Although it is... Oh, no, no.
[185:10.13]I ain't doing religion here.
[185:15.81]That's what I thought.
[185:16.33]I was like, let's say I get a little rocky here.
[185:22.58]That one definitely has Beanbag Sonic.
[185:28.78]The Goofy Movie?
[185:30.28]Yeah, I'll get some more bargain bin DVDs.
[185:35.02]Alright, what do you got?
[185:35.68]The Departed.
[185:37.88]God, I hope it's Matt Damon.
[185:45.76]It's the same thing that eats the microphone when it sings.
[185:49.08]We already have one of these.
[185:51.64]Wait, what?
[185:55.49]Copy... Hold on.
[185:56.95]This is a different one.
[185:59.73]Tort Boy.
[186:02.51]I'm so confused right now.
[186:04.45]What is happening?
[186:08.14]So the one on the right is... I don't know what it's trying to tell me to do.
[186:19.33]Copy.
[186:19.67]103, 124, he resists lightning.
[186:48.21]Now, you can't do Matt Tortman.
[186:49.97]It's not gonna happen.
[186:51.67]I don't even care.
[186:52.61]We're not gonna use this person.
[186:56.60]Matt Tortman.
[187:02.54]Hibernate.
[187:06.15]Oh, Jesus Christ, that's Jason Bourne.
[187:10.07]I already have five monsters in hibernation.
[187:13.94]What?
[187:14.26]I can't have more than five people?
[187:16.72]Oh, then just get rid of this one.
[187:17.94]I don't even want it.
[187:19.88]You can only have five monsters in this game.
[187:22.02]Why?
[187:23.26]You can have like 15 or something, or at least 10 in the other one.
[187:28.35]Get out of here.
[187:29.37]Fuck it.
[187:37.77]Should we try... Hold on, let me go get it.
[187:48.96]It flies down?
[187:49.92]No.
[188:04.64]Let's... I'm... If it's here, might as well do it.
[188:11.13]We're gonna... We're gonna use like the...
[188:16.12]Watch it actually be Beampack Sonic.
[188:18.40]I would fucking laugh my ass off.
[188:30.63]I've never even seen this movie.
[188:34.91]I've never seen this movie.
[188:36.83]Not even a clip.
[188:38.71]I didn't even see the trailer.
[188:55.95]Opening disk tray, please confirm.
[188:59.55]Why do I own it?
[189:00.31]Because I bought it at the bargain bin.
[189:04.75]When I wanted to get DVDs for Monster Rancher.
[189:07.11]It was there and I was like, oh yeah, I'll get that.
[189:08.99]And then I thought about it and I was like, maybe I shouldn't get that.
[189:12.77]And then here we are, fast forward.
[189:16.39]We're doing it.
[189:17.55]So whatever.
[189:18.11]Here we go.
[189:23.71]Passion of the Christ.
[189:25.46]Wait, what do you mean checking disk?
[189:34.91]Okay, I was gonna say.
[189:37.85]Here we go.
[189:45.07]Put your hands together.
[189:48.07]Four.
[189:55.97]A big monster.
[190:00.79]Quick.
[190:01.79]I need an element that starts with C. This is Rock Jesus.
[190:08.09]I need an element that starts with G. Or C. Like lead.
[190:15.46]Or... Cobalt.
[190:18.56]Jesus Cobalt?
[190:23.30]Jesus Carbon?
[190:26.30]Carbon Christ?
[190:28.28]No.
[190:30.46]We can't do Carbon Christ.
[190:31.84]That's, like, too much.
[190:36.97]Geo Jesus?
[190:43.47]What's he got for moves?
[190:44.25]I mean, that's... That life is pretty bad, but whatever.
[190:49.96]Alright, we're gonna call him... No, we're not calling him Christicle.
[190:55.20]Sorry.
[191:04.36]Geo-Jesus.
[191:05.10]Geo-Jesus is pretty perfect.
[191:17.90]Let's not step on any toes.
[191:19.38]How about Geo-Gees?
[191:27.25]Oh, I fucking hate this.
[191:28.73]And it's staying.
[191:29.81]Geo-Gees.
[191:30.81]Is that a zero?
[191:40.33]It's a bad 12 year old name?
[191:41.91]No, it's not.
[191:42.75]GOG's is perfect.
[191:47.33]It's so- it's trying too hard to not be GOG's that I like it.
[191:51.60]Done.
[191:53.70]GOG's with a zero.
[192:00.84]You'll be seeing him in Monster Rancher 4, coming up soon in like a fucking week.
[192:08.73]I was just about to... You know how I do that?
[192:10.55]You know, the thing that I do sometimes where I, like, throw discs behind me?
[192:14.99]I mean, I can't really do that with the passion of the Christ, you know what I mean?
[192:18.19]Like, I feel like a priest is gonna come in here and fucking smite me.
[192:22.25]I'm gonna go to, like, somebody's baptism.
[192:25.51]Some niece or distant relative or something, and they're gonna be like... I'm gonna walk in the fucking front doors.
[192:31.88]I'm gonna be sitting there in the seats, and the priest is gonna kind of come by and be like...
[192:36.37]Oh, yes.
[192:37.10]Oh, hello there.
[192:38.44]You're the uncle.
[192:39.54]Good to see you.
[192:40.70]Come here.
[192:41.04]Like, oh, by Christ, let me love you.
[192:43.44]Come here.
[192:43.94]And I saw that fucking stream where you threw Passion of the Christ, you fucking piece of garbage.
[192:48.60]And he's going to, like, push me back and be like, I love you guys.
[192:51.06]How are you?
[192:52.00]How is everything?
[192:52.94]How are the kids?
[192:55.37]He's going to watch the stream or something.
[192:56.83]Can't do it.
[193:08.86]Oh, what's that?
[193:10.20]That was Meet the Fockers, Father.
[193:11.58]That was Meet the Fockers, I'll prove it.
[193:12.95]Where'd it go?
[193:18.25]See, that was Meet the Fockers.
[193:21.01]I'm not being disrespectful, that was Meet the Fockers.
[193:27.43]Wait, I already threw, I already threw the VeggieTales one behind me.
[193:32.87]Isn't that, that's a religious one too.
[193:36.10]But this is not the same.
[193:37.04]These are not in the same category.
[193:39.51]These two are not the fucking same.
[193:42.39]One is like a goofy cartoon.
[193:44.33]And there is like a fucking detailed retelling of Christ.
[193:51.08]This is a cartoon.
[193:52.46]It's a joke.
[193:52.96]It's for like children and stuff.
[194:12.00]I can't do it.
[194:13.54]I can't do it.
[194:14.74]I'm not even religious.
[194:17.18]I can't do it, okay?
[194:19.54]Look, I'll make it up to you.
[194:20.64]I'll break click on camera.
[194:23.15]Does that make you feel better?
[194:31.15]No, I ain't doing it.
[194:32.69]I ain't doing it.
[194:33.61]I can't.
[194:35.83]No, I'm not doing it.
[194:36.91]No, that's a lot.
[194:37.85]I'm not crossing that line, okay?
[194:41.72]I don't cross lines.
[194:50.80]No, I gotta get away from this.
[194:51.95]I gotta get away from this.
[194:54.55]The face... I'm like a fucking child.
[194:56.55]You know what I mean?
[194:57.03]The facecam is on.
[195:00.69]Click is about Jesus too?
[195:02.09]No, it's not.
[195:02.65]Thank God.
[195:09.96]Click is safe.
[195:15.69]Thank God, click is safe.
[195:19.66]My fucking Lord.
[195:22.42]Why did I turn it back on?
[195:24.18]I'm telling you, my body and brain are fighting each other.
[195:26.84]Alright, save the game.
[195:29.70]I'm putting in Dino Crisis.
[195:33.85]I'm gonna put in Dino Christ.
[195:43.49]We'll pull these guys over to Monster Ranch before.
[195:58.21]Oh shit, I hit the ceiling.
[196:00.58]Look, that wasn't it!
[196:02.08]See?
[196:07.88]Oh fuck, I think I just like, I really just fucked up my ceiling a little.
[196:16.74]I gotta get out of here.
[196:26.96]How many?
[196:27.42]There are five monster ranches.
[196:28.61]Alright, let's put it in Dino Crisis.
[196:29.77]I need to go find it.
[196:32.23]Give me one second while I find Dino Crisis.
[196:34.65]I need to look at my ceiling, too.
[196:36.89]Ah, shit.
[196:37.53]Just a little crack.
[196:38.37]Not a big deal.
[196:39.72]Not something some fucking handyman can't fix.
[196:43.50]Alright, where is Dino Crisis?
[196:57.01]Oh, that's the shitty spider video game.
[197:00.75]No, that's not it.
[197:02.30]Oh boy, this is going to take a while.
[197:05.64]Uh, it's not over there.
[197:10.98]Oh boy, there's so many discs in here.
[197:15.46]This is going to be... I should probably get shitfaced before I do this.
[197:20.65]So I can find the secret spell in Monster Rancher 3.
[197:29.45]Is Dino Crisis a two or a one CD game?
[197:38.40]I can't even see the chat.
[197:39.78]Why am I asking out loud?
[197:42.52]It's a two CD game, right?
[198:05.25]It's probably in here.
[198:05.97]Hold on.
[198:08.89]Give me a second.
[198:10.05]Not that much longer.
[198:10.87]I promise.
[198:11.38]Not that much longer.
[198:12.12]They're leaving.
[198:12.84]They're leaving.
[198:13.24]You don't have any content for them.
[198:15.04]They don't have any content they're watching.
[198:16.20]They're watching a blank screen right now.
[198:17.70]You need to put on content before they all fucking leave.
[198:22.88]What about Tell a Joke?
[198:23.62]Maybe they'll think it's funny.
[198:26.41]They've been waiting in line and
[198:38.74]Is it a one disk or is it a two disk?
[198:45.50]Fuck.
[198:48.60]I don't know, I'm looking for a two disk right now and I think that's throwing me off.
[198:54.74]That's throwing me off right now.
[198:57.70]Give us content, hurry.
[199:00.10]I'm trying.
