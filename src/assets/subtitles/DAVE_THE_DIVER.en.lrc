[00:19.46]What is going on?
[00:23.30]How are you doing?
[00:30.64]Too early.
[00:32.46]It's a little early.
[00:33.16]You ever make a sound and you get caught on your own words?
[00:40.10]And it makes a sound you've never made before?
[00:43.52]That is what just happened.
[00:47.17]Can I refill my coffee?
[00:48.07]Of course I can.
[00:49.95]Give me two seconds.
[03:34.97]OK, I'm back.
[03:36.55]Hello.
[03:41.64]Sorry, took me so long.
[03:42.46]I had to sprint really, really fast.
[03:45.22]Yeah, but the coffee that I have in the fridge, it's it's like poof.
[03:53.61]Like maybe like two or three minute run from here.
[04:04.66]That would suck.
[04:05.72]Can I just say?
[04:09.04]When you think about like big houses or like big places.
[04:12.94]Oh yeah.
[04:16.52]17,000 square foot house.
[04:18.88]I would never want to live in one of those.
[04:21.18]Ever.
[04:25.12]I would think that there were ghosts in every room.
[04:32.65]No way.
[04:39.14]Then why do you?
[04:40.19]Dude, if you have a... If you have room for a bowling alley in your house... I don't want to live there.
[04:59.78]I appreciate smaller spaces.
[05:02.34]I think you can do way more with a smaller space.
[05:05.54]I don't like big spaces.
[05:06.86]I lose shit.
[05:10.13]You know how many times I pace around the living room?
[05:14.50]Just like under my breath going like, where the fuck are they?
[05:18.30]How is it fucking possible to lose my wallet again?
[05:24.27]How is it even possible?
[05:27.21]I'll pace around, I'll go into the bathroom.
[05:29.07]Was it in here?
[05:30.62]It's not even possible.
[05:34.10]and then you know end up finding it in the couch but imagine that times like 10 it'd be so awful I would have to have 10 or 20 wallets I'd have to have like 10 phones just in every room that's a skill issue oh that's wow yeah it is absolutely
[06:12.31]I love this.
[06:13.29]Have you been to Greek Chicken?
[06:14.67]They got a new location.
[06:15.79]The food slaps.
[06:17.85]I'll check it out if it's... I'm always into new food.
[06:22.15]Stop bragging about your phones and wallets.
[06:32.26]I don't have 10 phones and 10 wallets.
[06:34.56]I'm saying if I lived in a big, huge house, I would need to have like 5 or 10 different wallets.
[06:42.39]No, I would have... I would have a landline.
[06:45.31]I'd have a landline.
[06:47.49]That I know where the phone is at all times.
[06:50.73]I don't need to think about it.
[06:51.79]I don't need to... I know... I want a landline.
[06:56.40]So many of us that have so many problems remembering where our phone is.
[06:58.68]I want to bring the landline back.
[07:07.20]Anyways, let's talk.
[07:08.22]We got a few things to go over here.
[07:11.50]The first one... Is what we're doing today.
[07:15.98]Dave the Diver is in 1.0.
[07:18.08]It's been on the list for a long time.
[07:21.01]Sorry about the milk voice.
[07:25.41]Trying to get rid of it with some coffee, so... Game is really good.
[07:30.57]I have heard...
[07:32.72]It's very good.
[07:34.56]I've been told this is right up my alley.
[07:36.16]I've been told, Jeremy, you got to try this out.
[07:37.42]You got to check it out.
[07:39.56]And yeah, it's in 1.0 now.
[07:41.46]So why not?
[07:42.17]Let's give it a go.
[07:44.21]Second important thing is this stream is only going to be for about maybe just about three hours.
[07:50.31]Because we're going to raid Connor's stream.
[07:54.05]CDawg.
[07:55.97]Connor is doing a charity stream today.
[07:57.65]A charity auction stream.
[08:00.75]Which I have a couple of bundles in.
[08:07.16]There are two bundles.
[08:10.26]There is a raffle bundle.
[08:12.32]And then there is an auction bundle.
[08:16.89]So... You'll have to bear with me here while I explain what they are.
[08:22.35]The first one...
[08:24.90]The raffle item, which if you, the Grotto Beasts Twitter, obviously I already talked about this, but if you want, I can give you more details.
[08:32.04]The raffle item is four of the OG Archaeology Stream cards.
[08:41.80]And I believe they're all holographic.
[08:43.06]So if you remember the Archaeology Stream, the fake packs that I opened,
[08:53.40]Four of those cards are going to be in this charity raffle.
[08:59.52]Also, there's going to be a copy of the map.
[09:01.89]Remember the map prop?
[09:06.67]They were fake?
[09:10.51]Yeah, we... Holly made a ton of those cards here.
[09:14.93]So we picked out the ones that kind of... We looked the best, felt the best out of all the ones that were made for the original stream.
[09:23.65]And each one is from each individual artist.
[09:26.71]The four original team.
[09:29.65]The original stream.
[09:31.67]So.
[09:34.16]It's a pretty cool item.
[09:35.58]But you also get the map too.
[09:36.58]So that prop map.
[09:37.52]Maybe the one with the grandpa.
[09:38.62]Like oh he left me the map.
[09:39.64]And it was all burnt.
[09:41.00]We made a copy of that map.
[09:43.34]Just in case something happened to the original one.
[09:46.35]And I've had that here for a couple years.
[09:48.93]So you get that too.
[09:50.63]That's part of the bundle.
[09:53.21]And it's a raffle too, so this is not the auction item.
[09:56.25]I know a lot of people were saying like, oh shit, okay.
[10:00.05]Some Jermamite's gonna come in and drop tons of money and I'm not gonna have a chance at all.
[10:05.91]Well, the raffle is for you then.
[10:12.20]The auction is to...
[10:16.28]Grotto Beasts's holographic test sheets.
[10:20.38]So they're holographic print sheets that the printer sent us to approve the second print.
[10:28.48]And I signed both of them.
[10:31.29]And it's really interesting because the two sheets that are in this auction, their holographics don't exist in the real game.
[10:42.75]It's a different holographic type that is on these because they were tests.
[10:48.49]So they don't exist in the regular game.
[10:53.92]There's also a postcard that we sent to friends and family.
[10:57.92]So holographic postcard as well.
[11:02.82]They're holographic testies.
[11:06.96]They're uncut.
[11:07.52]Yes, they are uncut sheets.
[11:12.73]Are you going to auction the ass baseball?
[11:18.82]Uh, no.
[11:20.61]That's for me.
[11:26.19]But those are two different bundles.
[11:28.99]One's a raffle, one's an auction.
[11:31.09]And we did it that way because I wanted more people to participate.
[11:35.22]I wanted more people to see it and be able to, you know, throw, you know, less than five, ten bucks at an item and potentially get it.
[11:44.40]Rather than an auction that could go up into the hundreds, if not maybe the thousands.
[11:47.83]I have no idea what's going to happen.
[11:49.97]But I think a lot of money is going to get raised.
[11:52.45]There's a lot of really cool items.
[11:53.97]Tons of streamers and YouTubers have given stuff.
[11:57.31]So we'll rate it in a few hours.
[12:04.01]Do you sound constipated?
[12:05.87]I know.
[12:07.03]My voice and throat and body, everything's a little jumbled today.
[12:11.99]The last few days, I'd say.
[12:14.08]I'm kind of jumbled.
[12:16.84]I'm having stomach, intestinal problems too.
[12:19.46]I'm all jumbled up.
[12:20.58]I'll be alright though, don't worry.
[12:25.19]Let's get a little bit more coffee in me, I'll be good.
[12:31.99]Did he say testicles?
[12:38.59]It's not a testicle problem, okay?
[12:44.80]Oh my God.
[12:45.98]Alright, you guys ready to play Dave the Diver?
[12:48.26]Let's play it.
[12:51.66]I'm... I'm interested.
[12:58.73]Hey, what's on the agenda today?
[13:02.86]You gonna play this one game or you gonna be playing anything else after?
[13:06.88]Just this for probably two and a half hours or so.
[13:09.94]And then I'm going to dump you all on Connor's stream.
[13:12.82]I think one of the items, I think the raffle item, I think is happening pretty early.
[13:17.94]So... I would, you know... He's stalling?
[13:23.04]I mean, yeah, very importantly.
[13:24.14]I'm going to give you guys some info.
[13:28.14]Can you shout out my cat?
[13:30.74]Hey, Mr. Fuzzy!
[13:33.68]Thanks for watching the stream.
[13:36.88]You didn't say where your cat's name was, so I just assumed what it was.
[13:39.10]Alright, let's go.
[13:42.88]Just gonna chill out.
[13:43.62]Gonna play Dave the Diver.
[13:45.74]And then we'll continue.
[13:51.54]It's Mr. Fuzzy.
[13:53.34]Mr. Fuzzle.
[13:54.24]What is it?
[13:54.54]I just didn't see it.
[13:57.42]That's a valid assumption.
[13:58.42]Yeah, I think it was.
[14:07.35]What's the charity?
[14:07.83]The charity... Hold on.
[14:09.67]Yeah, there's... Shit, hold on.
[14:15.70]Let me tell... Hold on.
[14:16.60]Give me a second.
[14:18.08]It's the Immune Deficiency Foundation.
[14:19.54]Hold on, I gotta write something.
[14:25.44]Here we go.
[14:27.26]Immune Deficiency Foundation.
[14:28.84]No, I knew what it was.
[14:29.60]I just... I have to talk to somebody.
[14:30.79]Give me one second.
[14:41.50]How do you raffle... Hold on, give me one second.
[15:01.89]Okay.
[15:02.45]You know what a notification... I can't even talk today.
[15:04.55]You know what a notification pops up in your phone?
[15:07.03]And it just kind of ruins your entire train of thought?
[15:09.71]That's what just happened.
[15:14.72]That doesn't happen to anybody?
[15:17.46]He had to take a bong rip.
[15:24.76]That does not happen to anybody else?
[15:26.33]Come on.
[15:28.33]Alright, let's go.
[15:33.73]I get distracted incredibly easily.
[15:44.43]We know.
[15:44.79]Facecam?
[15:54.02]No, not today.
[15:57.79]Not right now.
[15:59.15]I feel terrible.
[16:00.45]You know what I mean?
[16:00.99]Like, this is not facecam days.
[16:02.79]The last, like, four or five days, I'd say.
[16:05.94]These are very much anti-facecam days.
[16:24.79]Well, terrible is the wrong word.
[16:27.15]Terrible would imply that I... I just feel like... That's the best way to describe it.
[16:41.20]What about the classic no-cam Jerma era?
[16:43.70]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[16:57.26]Okay, I don't know very much about this game.
[16:59.15]I just know that I wanted to play it.
[17:02.29]Is this a roguelike?
[17:04.53]Is this a trinket collector?
[17:05.83]Is this a... You fight stuff?
[17:13.17]No?
[17:13.57]Okay.
[17:22.25]It's a granny like.
[17:23.51]I doubt this is a granny like.
[17:31.20]What's the last granny like that came out?
[17:45.43]Hello, neighbor.
[17:49.29]It's... I don't... Hello Neighbor came out, like, seven years ago.
[17:52.53]There's definitely been one since then.
[18:01.06]Oh, Dave, you got here quickly.
[18:02.08]Hello?
[18:05.80]Oh, there we go.
[18:07.70]Well, I was told to hurry here.
[18:08.94]I was on vacation, you know.
[18:11.21]So where's the sushi at?
[18:13.83]Don't rush yourself.
[18:14.53]Have a look around.
[18:16.41]Look at this giant blue hole.
[18:18.09]I've never seen anything like this.
[18:21.07]It's not just the size.
[18:22.28]Every time you enter the giant blue hole, the terrain and ecology changes.
[18:25.98]Which means, this could be an incredible business opportunity.
[18:29.78]What kind of business?
[18:32.64]Well, we can discuss that later.
[18:34.34]I heard you took a break from diving.
[18:35.68]How about warming up?
[18:37.35]I'll guide you from here.
[18:38.13]Go ahead and go in.
[18:38.71]I don't have a good feeling about this.
[18:41.35]Okay.
[18:43.89]Okay.
[18:45.65]A sushi bar.
[18:48.47]Try moving with... Oh, which one is... What is that?
[18:51.37]I have X, Y, A, and B. Is it a bumper?
[18:55.97]Left bumper?
[19:05.94]A shitload of you just screamed at the screen.
[19:08.26]I'm... Just relax, okay?
[19:10.88]That was a test.
[19:12.76]That was a test to see how patient you really are.
[19:15.60]And a lot of you aren't.
[19:16.28]Okay.
[19:22.50]Move to the marked area.
[19:26.92]Okay.
[19:27.14]So this is like a boost.
[19:34.70]How's the volume?
[19:35.14]Good?
[19:39.57]Okay.
[19:40.37]The dive knife.
[19:45.05]Use the dive knife.
[19:50.07]Ooh.
[19:51.57]Smooth and quick.
[19:52.45]And finally, you haven't forgotten how to use the harpoon, have you?
[19:54.69]Harpoon?
[19:56.19]Well, I haven't used one in a long time.
[19:58.61]Aim first and... Looks like you need some practice.
[20:01.72]Try the harpoon to catch, let's say, three fish.
[20:04.16]Got a huge announcement, by the way.
[20:06.60]I have an unbelievably massive announcement, and I waited until this many people were here to tell you it.
[20:12.89]Massive announcement.
[20:14.61]Unbelievably massive.
[20:17.15]Ladies and gentlemen, the first ever House Flipper Invitational, where a bunch of streamers make a house and I have to grade it, is officially on Monday.
[20:38.09]Monday at 4 o'clock Pacific.
[20:44.49]Time might change, but Monday the 3rd is the House Flipper Invitational.
[20:50.55]Well, that's what I'm calling it.
[20:51.35]There's no official... Nothing official with House Flipper, but... I think that's going to be a ton of fun.
[21:01.36]Whoa.
[21:03.06]Aim with A and press right trigger to fire.
[21:06.09]Oh, I get it.
[21:10.59]That's sick.
[21:12.61]Yeah.
[21:13.87]I will announce who is going to be in it.
[21:17.81]Probably on Twitter and on Discord and everything.
[21:19.37]And they'll probably talk about it too.
[21:20.47]But so far, I've been reaching out to people.
[21:22.39]So far, we've got a good group so far.
[21:28.60]And just in case anything comes up and the roster changes, I'll wait another day or two.
[21:34.78]But yeah, we've got some good people coming up.
[21:39.05]It's going to be a lot of fun.
[21:40.95]I'll have different grading criteria.
[21:45.62]everybody gets and here this is actually this here here hear me out is 60 minutes if everybody starts at the same time is his ass has no plan I got a whole document written uh I have 60 minutes everybody starts at the same time and everybody's graded on five different criteria do you think 60 minutes is enough time
[22:09.78]You're stuttering today.
[22:10.72]Yeah, I know.
[22:11.72]I'm a stuttering guy.
[22:13.96]I'm usually like that.
[22:14.94]And when I don't feel that great, it's like amplified.
[22:16.92]So you're going to get like triple the stutters today.
[22:21.29]Is 90 better?
[22:23.25]I feel like 90 is what it was originally, but I'm kind of afraid to have it be 90.
[22:29.89]I feel like 90 might be a little too long.
[22:33.54]The last time when me and Ludwig did this for the bro versus bro, it was 40 minutes and it felt like it was, oh, okay.
[22:43.05]It was alright, but I would have liked a little bit more time, but not that much more.
[22:46.93]75, split the difference.
[22:55.48]We'll see, but it's somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes is what it will be.
[23:08.81]Yeah, everyone's gonna start with the same house, and everyone starts at the same time.
[23:13.81]It's gonna be like a Chopped on Food Network scenario, where it's like, hands up, everybody stop.
[23:17.09]Okay, I gotta read this, hold on.
[23:20.73]75 is good.
[23:25.92]I think we start with 60 and then we can add time if we want to.
[23:29.00]We can do like a... Let's... Veto everything and add 15 minutes.
[23:35.17]Depending.
[23:36.19]Who knows?
[23:36.53]It could get to a point where... We get to 55 minutes or like 45 minutes and everybody's just done.
[23:42.28]Like, oh, okay.
[23:43.70]Because I want there to be pressure.
[23:48.12]They're going to be graded on creativity, complexity, cleanliness, structural integrity, philosophy.
[23:55.52]I've got a whole five point system.
[24:02.95]And they have to take me through a tour of the house.
[24:05.61]One by one.
[24:08.35]Philosophy, yeah.
[24:10.11]Oh, by the way, and chat's grade.
[24:12.90]And there's going to be a weighted scale.
[24:14.49]I put a lot of thought into this.
[24:16.39]I tell you, I've got a whole document with all my things in it.
[24:20.41]Yeah, chat will get agreed.
[24:27.49]When are you going to do a twerking competition?
[24:33.62]Alright.
[24:37.18]Yeah, that's coming up on Monday.
[24:40.94]Now, it's possible that some things need to be changed.
[24:44.08]This is, you know, I'm leaving it up in the air, but July 3rd is the date.
[24:50.92]Gotta make sure to get everybody at the same time.
[24:52.59]A lot of people have different schedules.
[24:54.69]Trying to get a bunch of people to do it at the same time.
[24:58.83]I'll give you more info this coming weekend.
[25:04.09]So just get the ingredients.
[25:06.62]You got it.
[25:07.18]So I can eat as much sushi as I want.
[25:08.90]Yeah, sure.
[25:09.42]You have to pay, though.
[25:11.28]Let's check it out.
[25:18.64]Go sushi.
[25:28.15]His ass is not reading.
[25:31.25]Well, I'm reading some of it.
[25:39.73]Okay, let's go.
[25:41.61]It's already finished?
[25:42.69]You?
[25:43.65]You're the fisherman Cobra was talking about.
[25:46.67]Well, I'm more of a diver than a fisherman.
[25:48.20]Alright, anyway, it's nice to meet you.
[25:49.62]I'm Bansho.
[25:51.26]So you like sushi?
[25:52.00]I sure do.
[25:53.30]Tuna belly, eel... Oh boy, just thinking about it makes my mouth water.
[25:58.55]Just as mediocre as I expected.
[26:02.13]Sushi is a food that combines the soul of sea and land.
[26:04.37]It symbolizes Mother Nature herself.
[26:07.29]Most people, however, have only tasted more accessible fish, just like you.
[26:11.50]How empty a life is one that ends without ever tasting the beauty Mother Nature can offer?
[26:16.68]My calling is to bring the taste of Mother Nature to every... What's wrong with those choices?
[26:33.18]What's wrong with tuna?
[26:36.56]An earthquake?
[26:38.30]The interior is really quite a mess.
[26:39.63]Looks like we're going to have to delay the opening.
[26:43.67]You know what?
[26:44.17]I spent all my money getting this restaurant ready.
[26:46.39]I'll have to recover the repair cost of doing business.
[26:49.73]In this state?
[26:51.95]Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha!
[26:52.95]In the end, the importance of a restaurant is the taste.
[26:56.33]First, we need ingredients.
[26:57.37]Did you bring anything?
[26:58.77]Oh, I have something I just can't.
[27:02.32]Only three fish?
[27:02.97]This won't be nearly enough to serve the guests.
[27:06.01]Please go and catch seven more fish.
[27:07.67]Restaurant's going to be open only in the evening.
[27:12.31]Okay.
[27:17.02]What?
[27:19.32]It's the chef's duty to prepare the best possible food with meticulous precision just as a warrior sharpens his sword on a whetstone.
[27:26.78]You need to get me the best quality ingredients during the day.
[27:30.43]I can do that.
[27:34.36]People are so mad.
[27:35.58]Why?
[27:35.84]Because of my Bwahaha?
[27:40.93]I think every Bwahaha that I do, I lose like 50 followers.
[27:45.81]I have to be careful.
[27:47.59]How many followers do I have?
[27:52.45]How many times can I do Bwahaha and lose 50 people a day before I lose all these followers?
[28:00.03]I wonder how long it would take.
[28:00.95]It's probably going to take a while.
[28:02.47]I'll be alright.
[28:08.81]I haven't seen Banshee so enthusiastic since the incident.
[28:12.30]Oops, maybe I shouldn't have brought that up.
[28:13.78]Well, anyways, we need more ingredients.
[28:15.40]Go catch seven fish.
[28:20.56]Followers plummeting.
[28:22.92]No, no, my followers.
[28:24.47]My followers!
[28:25.13]Okay.
[28:27.31]Make 100 gold and catch fish.
[28:31.37]Let's do it.
[28:37.62]If you go deeper than your current equipment allows, your oxygen will flash red and will deplete quickly.
[28:42.14]Okay.
[28:44.85]Catch fish, make money.
[28:46.51]I got it.
[28:50.45]Does it matter what fish I get?
[28:51.43]There's one.
[29:01.18]Pyramid butterfly fish.
[29:10.03]Does the quality go down if I use the harpoon?
[29:12.75]Kind of like a Red Dead Redemption situation.
[29:17.15]Am I messing up the quality?
[29:19.07]No, okay.
[29:24.13]Huh?
[29:24.31]Alright, good.
[29:30.12]Ooh, look at these ones.
[29:34.70]What's that?
[29:36.22]I can't pick it up.
[29:41.86]Really?
[29:42.10]Do I need a better harpoon?
[29:47.64]Ooh, you just have to tap it.
[30:03.01]Okay.
[30:03.23]Do you need to weaken them if their HP is too high?
[30:08.55]Okay.
[30:12.15]So do I have to go up?
[30:15.55]Or will it kind of be like, hey, your oxygen's low.
[30:18.77]Time to end the day.
[30:19.40]Or do I have to physically go all the way up physically with the character?
[30:24.28]What is that?
[30:24.68]Ooh.
[30:29.92]Okay.
[30:31.20]The O2 just is the timer.
[30:34.19]You do not have to go up.
[30:35.51]Okay.
[30:38.83]So I get to increase time by seeing those on the ground.
[30:41.79]Got it.
[30:55.78]I'm gonna just only go for these ones.
[30:58.92]Two times of the harpoon.
[31:03.78]What's in the pot?
[31:18.95]Potion?
[31:20.29]Soy sauce.
[31:25.12]new do I have to make recipes or something what about the giant eel can I die okay I think I can die so that's a bad idea
[31:55.37]That thing looks rare.
[31:57.75]Running out of air.
[31:58.45]Warning.
[32:04.47]Give me this first.
[32:05.19]Alright, go.
[32:08.30]Do I have to go up?
[32:08.92]You guys said I didn't have to go up!
[32:10.86]You said I didn't have to go up!
[32:13.14]Did one guy do that?
[32:26.79]You still need oxygen.
[32:28.09]I'm good.
[32:38.57]I definitely made 100.
[32:39.17]Prepare sushi ingredients.
[32:47.20]Ooh, OK.
[32:52.12]Biggest fish was that one two stars.
[32:55.50]Cooking ingredients.
[32:57.24]And fish.
[32:58.02]Two fish tank.
[32:58.68]Do I have to wrap up your day and get things ready at the sushi place?
[33:03.22]Okay.
[33:03.40]You can only dive once in the morning and once in the afternoon.
[33:09.22]Get the ingredients ready before the dinner hours start.
[33:11.52]Isn't it like 10 o'clock at night?
[33:15.54]What time is it?
[33:17.09]It's late.
[33:24.88]How about you let me play this game?
[33:32.02]Well, just go get it.
[33:32.84]It's on Steam right now.
[33:33.95]Okay.
[33:37.33]Bring ingredients back.
[33:38.21]Okay.
[33:45.28]Okay.
[33:48.90]Here you can check your fish, crops, sauces, and all the other materials you have.
[33:52.28]For now, that's all you need to know.
[33:54.28]Come back later for more information.
[33:55.68]I have to make a menu?
[34:07.59]New recipes need to be added to the menu before they can be sold to customers.
[34:11.33]There's a sushi recipe for the fish you acquired earlier, so try registering that to the menu.
[34:19.38]What do we got?
[34:22.72]Clownfish sushi.
[34:25.44]What's the most expensive one?
[34:28.86]Four?
[34:29.58]Ten?
[34:29.88]This one's ten.
[34:34.23]Add three.
[34:34.99]Okay.
[34:40.71]E-clown sushi.
[34:43.12]Setting ingredients to auto-supply will make things a bit more convenient.
[34:46.93]Let me repeat.
[34:47.99]Only food on the menu can be sold.
[34:50.55]If you run out of ingredients, you'll have to replace items on the menu or refill the ingredients.
[34:55.03]Got it.
[34:56.25]You can enhance the flavor with the soy sauce.
[35:07.66]Okay.
[35:08.92]Just put the most expensive ones on.
[35:11.10]This one's
[35:13.43]This one's 9?
[35:15.59]I could put 12 on here.
[35:16.63]Okay.
[35:17.39]Just fill the whole menu out.
[35:22.61]6.
[35:25.69]And then 4.
[35:28.51]Bronze or high?
[35:29.15]Alright, that's good, right?
[35:30.67]Give me a cup of green tea.
[35:34.09]Have you poured green tea before?
[35:37.67]No, only soft drink.
[35:39.99]You've only had soda?
[35:47.36]Is this like Diner Dash?
[35:48.64]Do I have to do a Diner Dash game?
[35:50.32]Pour the right amount.
[36:02.98]It kept going.
[36:06.12]It's good it was the tutorial because that kept pouring.
[36:18.74]I'm not doing it.
[36:22.80]Wait until the cooking is done.
[36:23.82]Is there a sprint?
[36:30.33]Come over to where I am to take the food.
[36:32.57]Pick up the food.
[36:34.31]You can dash when serving food.
[36:42.40]Can I drop it?
[36:49.11]What the hell?
[36:49.47]The food can't be reused, we have to throw it out.
[36:55.77]Seems like such a waste.
[36:58.75]We never reuse food.
[36:59.91]We do not put food made for guests on the table twice.
[37:06.03]And I just eat it?
[37:06.61]Don't forget to press Y after filling the menu for business to begin.
[37:18.63]Alright, open the business.
[37:29.32]What can I get you?
[37:29.88]Green tea?
[37:32.32]You got it.
[37:34.37]Oh shit.
[37:40.51]That's pretty good.
[37:41.11]Alright, what do you want?
[37:46.07]Who ordered first?
[37:46.70]I don't remember.
[37:52.21]I'm already out of stamina.
[37:59.43]Did somebody just leave unhappy?
[38:06.61]I can only go as fast as he can cook.
[38:11.51]Anybody need tea?
[38:18.06]Does anybody need any tea?
[38:21.46]I have to clean.
[38:25.72]You ordered first, but whatever.
[38:26.74]Sorry.
[38:33.18]This is what I'm talking about.
[38:34.14]Yep.
[38:37.03]I have negative $52?
[38:38.15]Wait, what?
[38:40.97]Oh, right, right, right.
[38:41.89]Okay.
[38:42.09]I was going to say, what did I do?
[38:43.51]Is my service so bad that I have to pay?
[39:01.49]Okay.
[39:03.90]Not quite there, but... It's debt.
[39:10.22]It's debt.
[39:12.04]Alright, $77.
[39:12.66]So I gotta get some better stuff.
[39:17.76]This game's cool.
[39:18.39]I like this game.
[39:24.59]You're a bit clumsy, but not bad for a first day.
[39:26.49]Try a little harder next time.
[39:27.81]First of all.
[39:38.00]He likes it.
[39:46.75]What are you doing?
[39:48.09]Alright, this game keeps changing the game that I think it is.
[39:59.05]Every 10 minutes.
[40:10.47]There are gigantic monsters.
[40:13.59]There's a lot to this game, to be honest.
[40:14.93]Yeah, this looks cool.
[40:22.02]Are you the man who's been diving around here?
[40:24.34]I think so.
[40:26.00]I was expecting a more professional looking guy.
[40:27.82]I can hear you, though.
[40:30.74]In any case, can you do something for me?
[40:33.20]Shouldn't you tell me who you are first?
[40:35.14]I'm Ellie.
[40:35.76]I study biology at the local graduate school.
[40:38.61]I've come out to investigate after reports of anomalies in the area.
[40:42.51]Satisfied?
[40:43.07]Okay, so what do you want?
[40:45.89]I'd like to study the ecology of this blue hole.
[40:48.33]Get me some agar and red starfish.
[40:51.52]I don't think it's a good idea to ask for just one of each, so get me two.
[41:00.14]Your tone makes me want to refuse.
[41:02.66]Got a reward.
[41:03.36]If you don't want it, that's fine.
[41:06.80]Reward?
[41:07.30]Okay.
[41:12.41]This is a side quest, I'm imagining, right?
[41:18.41]Okay, phone.
[41:28.84]Wait, he's on the boat.
[41:31.96]A waste of phone fees.
[41:33.18]Talk to me in person.
[41:39.35]Throw the phone into the ocean.
[41:40.71]Alright, that's cool.
[41:49.61]Let's go.
[41:51.05]I get it now.
[41:58.51]Call him again.
[42:01.65]You definitely don't get it.
[42:02.81]I, of course I do watch.
[42:11.98]I want to pick up ingredients.
[42:12.94]Alright.
[42:21.26]Only good fish.
[42:22.76]I don't want like, look at this.
[42:23.98]It's not going to wow anybody at the restaurant.
[42:31.37]Underwater scooter?
[42:32.31]Allows you to move quickly underwater.
[42:34.31]Can't be used once the battery runs out.
[42:37.71]10 second of battery use?
[42:42.97]Oh, so it's a boost.
[42:47.49]He thinks the big fish equal best fish.
[42:50.62]Early on, I would say that's probably accurate.
[42:52.42]Sword?
[42:59.48]Sword?
[43:04.84]Ooh.
[43:05.00]Does this thing have durability?
[43:16.18]Blue Tang.
[43:22.08]Rainbow Rice?
[43:24.80]Rassy?
[43:25.60]Ras?
[43:25.80]What was it?
[43:27.28]You're wasting oxygen.
[43:31.08]How do you think Peter Griffin would feel about this game?
[43:37.23]Uh, I'm sorry.
[43:38.51]Peter Griffin wouldn't play this game.
[43:40.93]Peter Griffin would do a callback reference to when he was the main character of this game.
[43:47.33]You've got your Family Guy wrong.
[43:52.91]Oh, it hurts.
[43:53.86]I don't think sea urchins can be picked up with these gloves.
[43:58.44]Really?
[44:01.94]He's so mad.
[44:06.81]I'm not picking that up yet.
[44:07.69]I don't need it yet.
[44:24.84]Oh, look at these ones.
[44:25.44]I need those.
[44:28.96]These are going to be so expensive.
[44:51.44]He is seething with rage.
[45:00.31]What is that big one right there?
[45:05.94]Okay, that attacked me.
[45:08.40]If you exceed your weight limit, you will slow down.
[45:10.67]If you exceed an even higher amount, you won't be able to carry anymore.
[45:14.25]Organize.
[45:18.29]Overburdened?
[45:21.76]Uh... What's the shittiest thing I have?
[45:35.63]This thing's pretty awful.
[45:37.67]But it's the one I just got.
[45:41.35]Take off your oxygen mask.
[45:46.21]This thing's like, meh.
[45:47.17]This is just seaweed.
[45:56.34]Okay.
[46:00.56]These are two stars.
[46:01.44]I'm almost there.
[46:03.18]Should I go up now?
[46:14.85]9.7.
[46:15.31]9.1.
[46:19.21]Okay.
[46:25.21]Well, I have to go up.
[46:30.41]Nice math.
[46:34.03]I'm learning.
[46:35.29]I just learned.
[46:38.11]Skulls indicate poison.
[46:38.95]Poison.
[46:43.47]I'm going to go back up.
[46:44.53]I have a full inventory.
[46:54.34]Playing it wrong.
[46:59.55]It's the second dive.
[47:01.11]I got a, I got a trigger fish.
[47:03.83]Those things are worth millions of decimal points.
[47:12.80]Okay.
[47:23.89]I did notice that the fish in the blue hole have an odd violent streak.
[47:28.31]Something puts them on edge.
[47:29.25]Speaking of which, why don't you also take a gun in addition to the harpoon?
[47:33.15]A gun.
[47:35.64]Brandu's knowledgeable about guns.
[47:40.02]Who's the goofy guy?
[47:43.26]I'm Dave.
[47:45.73]I thought divers were athletic and muscular.
[47:47.53]You seem to defy my prior knowledge.
[47:50.73]People who live in glass houses.
[47:52.49]Oh yeah, that's right.
[47:57.04]So what's this about?
[47:57.80]I'd like to get straight to the point.
[47:59.38]I've got a very interesting business.
[48:00.50]This guy laughs a lot.
[48:04.00]And now I'm in need of some weapons.
[48:06.08]Duff, I need your help.
[48:06.99]Hmm, season two of Straw Stella just ended anyway.
[48:10.85]I'll give you a listen.
[48:14.61]Discovered a fascinating giant blue hole.
[48:16.35]The terrain and ecology inside it changes every time you go inside.
[48:20.47]Any equipment found inside breaks down when brought out.
[48:23.38]I'd like you to make us a weapon that can be used inside.
[48:26.16]Okay.
[48:33.36]Anything that's not made from materials found in the blue hole will continue to break down.
[48:36.92]This would be especially true of guns, which have precision parts.
[48:41.32]So we'll have to get the materials from overseas.
[48:44.45]I thought that just said from overseas.
[48:46.29]I was like, what?
[48:49.99]Okay.
[48:54.13]I need one rope and one scrap iron.
[48:58.94]You heard him right, Dave.
[49:00.12]Enter the blue hole and bring back rope and scrap iron.
[49:05.65]If you run out of oxygen midway, you'll only be able to make it back with one item.
[49:09.99]So that's the penalty, okay.
[49:18.26]Um... I have to... I have to get rid of stuff.
[49:27.16]Can I store the fish that I have right now?
[49:28.86]Or should I just bring them over to the menu?
[49:30.58]Because I can die again.
[49:36.11]You already did.
[49:36.93]Oh, so I can go back now.
[49:39.13]You already did that.
[49:39.93]Your inventory is auto.
[49:40.79]Okay, I'll go back down.
[49:45.73]I need rope, iron.
[49:54.02]Sunflower update.
[49:55.64]We're getting some really good pictures.
[49:59.69]They just started opening as of two or three days ago.
[50:02.51]The last three, four days, I want to say.
[50:07.49]We have a Hydra.
[50:09.19]This thing was really healthy and was really... It was fed very well, apparently.
[50:14.14]This sunflower, the big one, has like eight heads.
[50:18.82]It's gonna be crazy looking.
[50:22.82]Alright, can I pick this up?
[50:25.07]Starfish.
[50:26.79]Alright, there's that.
[50:27.77]Need two of those.
[50:30.47]Ow, what?
[50:33.05]I need a scrap of iron.
[50:41.63]This is wood.
[50:42.17]Alright, don't use too much oxygen, I don't know.
[51:00.32]Why is this depth blinking?
[51:03.82]The depth thing is blinking, why?
[51:12.32]I'm too deep?
[51:14.84]Am I?
[51:15.32]Am I actually too deep?
[51:19.93]But there's rope down here.
[51:20.85]And wood.
[51:23.57]Alright, I need one more.
[51:28.91]Where's my quest log?
[51:30.80]I need one more.
[51:31.30]Alright, go up, go up, go up.
[51:33.88]I need oxygen.
[51:45.29]I gotta get out of here.
[51:49.75]Go hurry up and get out of here.
[51:54.01]Shit, I thought I was going to die much quicker than that.
[51:56.31]You have the harpoon?
[52:01.77]I do have the harpoon, you're right.
[52:08.59]Basic underwater rifle.
[52:11.25]Download Duff's Weapon Shop.
[52:13.91]Only 42 megabytes.
[52:22.97]Craft.
[52:29.44]What the hell is going on?
[52:42.18]There was a missed opportunity there.
[52:43.68]I feel like this is the character that would say, Exquisite.
[52:48.12]This is exquisite, right?
[52:59.55]So this replaces the harpoon, I'm going to imagine.
[53:05.05]I can open weapon chests?
[53:08.26]Okay.
[53:12.76]Blueprints.
[53:20.04]So if I make it with a blueprint, they won't break down underwater.
[53:22.85]Nice.
[53:28.95]I hope that when you're 50, you look back at what you said and cringe.
[53:32.75]Ball Fondler, why are there like three of you now?
[53:36.35]I just read another- I read a Ball Fondler comment 10-20 minutes ago.
[53:39.87]It was a different- It was a different account.
[53:42.55]Why are there like five of you?
[53:45.45]I'm so confused.
[53:51.86]It's not the same person.
[53:52.78]It's a different account.
[53:53.94]These are fake accounts.
[53:59.32]Should we just ban them all?
[54:00.36]Should we just ban any type?
[54:02.08]If your name has Ball Fondler in it, like, you're just gone.
[54:09.93]not allowed on this stream.
[54:11.67]That's funny.
[54:13.91]Everyone but the OG gets banned.
[54:20.18]That's funny.
[54:25.78]Somebody said stop giving attention to these people.
[54:29.48]Yeah, you know what?
[54:30.48]That's also right.
[54:31.73]That's also a correct statement too.
[54:37.47]Okay.
[54:37.99]You can craft weapons now.
[54:45.64]Alright, wrap up the day and let's go... Yeah, let's go do it.
[54:55.79]Ban the false fondlers.
[55:00.15]I did nothing, good sir.
[55:04.47]Yeah.
[55:06.29]Yeah.
[55:07.59]That's debatable.
[55:08.98]That's debatable.
[55:10.42]But, no, okay.
[55:11.02]Alright.
[55:11.56]Okay.
[55:12.30]Okay.
[55:18.24]Food with a high taste score will increase customer satisfaction.
[55:21.40]He's innocent.
[55:22.14]Alright, let me check the menu.
[55:27.50]What can I do?
[55:28.46]Level 1.
[55:30.21]I can enhance it.
[55:30.89]Hold on.
[55:31.53]What's the most expensive thing I have?
[55:34.67]Mediterranean carrot fish.
[55:37.21]And I can make it better with... What do I have?
[55:43.47]How do I make it better?
[55:44.21]Do I have to pay?
[55:45.18]Or do I have to give fish to make it better?
[55:51.55]What am I losing by doing this?
[55:55.77]I'm losing three fish.
[56:07.11]VIP Ball Fondler so you know who the real one is.
[56:09.25]I don't want a VIP Ball Fondler.
[56:11.08]I feel like that would all of a sudden Ball Fondler would have like a massive ego trip, I think.
[56:17.00]No, that's not happening.
[56:20.99]I think we would get ball fall under being like, do you know who I am type scenarios?
[56:24.93]We're not having that here.
[56:25.74]It says Mr. Ego.
[56:33.34]This is my channel.
[56:36.24]This is my stream.
[56:37.18]It says Mr. Ego.
[56:46.96]That's so funny.
[56:51.82]Do you have any idea who he is?
[56:53.18]Yeah.
[56:58.06]I know who he is.
[57:00.42]This one can be enhanced.
[57:02.89]Alright, alright, alright.
[57:03.73]I only have one of these.
[57:05.33]So let's do the expensive items first.
[57:08.35]I only have one.
[57:11.73]These are... These are alright.
[57:17.00]Alright.
[57:26.37]Wait, is this going to kill somebody?
[57:28.03]You guys said this was poisonous.
[57:29.93]Whatever.
[57:30.21]You only have four sushi for sale.
[57:44.35]Well, I'm just trying to get to 100 bucks.
[57:45.61]I'll be alright.
[57:51.09]Green tea.
[57:51.51]I got you right here.
[57:56.64]Almost perfect poor.
[57:57.52]Hell yeah.
[58:09.03]Okay, now I know that that's the fake one.
[58:11.48]Okay, now I know that's the fake one.
[58:12.76]A Ball Fonzler account just said, hey, give me 20 bucks.
[58:17.06]Alright, now I know you're absolutely not the real one.
[58:32.12]Somebody said, I want 20 bucks too.
[58:38.16]Oh, man.
[58:38.70]Yeah, please be careful.
[59:10.41]Me too.
[59:10.91]Me too.
[59:11.93]I wanted to... Don't get tricked by any fake Ball Fonder accounts, please.
[59:20.15]Or even from the real one.
[59:21.87]You know what I'm saying?
[59:22.81]Just be diligent.
[59:38.12]Fifty-five.
[59:46.66]He tricked you into a six-month one guy.
[59:48.78]But it was... Alright, you can't deny that the original Ball Fondler arc was not really funny.
[60:00.60]You can't deny that.
[60:02.52]It was.
[60:03.50]Nobody can deny that.
[60:17.88]Okay, so we did the repair.
[60:19.48]I'm Dr. Bacon.
[60:21.08]I'm an archaeologist who studies the Sea People civilization.
[60:23.80]The Sea People?
[60:25.42]I'll explain it to you.
[60:26.02]Aren't you lucky to have an expert like me tell you about it?
[60:29.09]What are you doing?
[60:49.07]Okay.
[60:50.35]They worshipped fish and had gills allowing them to live underwater.
[60:53.25]They lived in the depths allowing them to flourish without any concern for invasions by other civilizations.
[60:57.61]The sudden changes to the sea bottom brought about their abrupt downfall.
[61:00.45]It's about all there is.
[61:05.91]Everyone thinks it's a myth and nothing more, of course.
[61:08.24]But proof that they were real was found right in the vicinity of this place.
[61:12.72]An amazing find.
[61:19.20]People want me to do a lot of different things here.
[61:20.54]Okay.
[61:21.32]That's interesting.
[61:36.89]What business do you have with me?
[61:39.06]Well, you see, my assistant's cryptocurrency investments didn't pan out, and he won't be around for a good while.
[61:45.02]That's why I'd like you to help me.
[61:48.48]My assistant told me that the artifact was found 70 meters or so below the surface.
[61:53.42]Please go take a look.
[61:55.66]We're busy with the sushi bar.
[61:56.84]I don't think we can.
[61:59.24]Sorry to interrupt the conversation.
[62:00.62]I'm Cobra.
[62:01.22]I work with Dave.
[62:02.76]Of course we should help you.
[62:03.76]We'll gladly do so.
[62:07.31]What?
[62:07.43]We don't have time for this.
[62:08.23]Just swim around.
[62:09.09]Look for artifacts.
[62:10.95]Think about it.
[62:11.40]If an underwater civilization is discovered, countless people will flock here.
[62:14.64]Bancho Sushi will be bursting at the seams.
[62:17.96]Suppose that you have a point.
[62:20.54]Alright, I'll help.
[62:23.12]Isn't that lucky?
[62:23.64]Of course.
[62:24.50]I won't be asking you to work for free.
[62:26.52]I'll upgrade the diving suit you're wearing for free.
[62:30.20]With an enhanced diving suit, you'll be able to venture deeper.
[62:33.06]This is essential for exploration.
[62:36.42]These days, even such things can be handled by an app.
[62:39.85]Technological advancements are amazing, eh?
[62:42.91]Let's first install the iDiver app on the phone before we proceed.
[62:46.73]Okay, so you can upgrade.
[62:53.93]I love upgrades.
[62:58.09]I have a question for the chat.
[63:01.58]I love upgrades.
[63:04.72]If there's a game where the oxygen tank is level 1 and you can get it to level 20, what is the best one that I have not played?
[63:21.49]That's not a question?
[63:23.09]You needed to wait for two or three sentences to come out.
[63:27.81]What is like an unbelievable upgrade game?
[63:33.10]People saying Subnautica.
[63:36.60]Really?
[63:36.88]I feel like I played Subnautica.
[63:40.15]Is that like an upgrade game?
[63:41.75]I love upgrades, Batches.
[63:42.87]Just start signing these people up.
[63:53.07]Permanently.
[63:54.47]For one minute.

[64:27.03]Yeah, Stardew Valley, I've played it a lot though.
[64:39.18]Who said, what's this one?
[64:43.82]Uh, idle games.
[64:45.56]Yeah, I've played a lot of them.
[64:46.86]Factorio.
[64:47.48]I feel like I'm not smart enough to play Factorio.
[64:56.25]Factorio to me just kind of seemed... This is a lot of information that I don't know.
[65:05.17]Graveyard Keeper has a lot.
[65:08.99]I'm dumb as bricks and it's fun.
[65:16.91]Maybe I'll check it out.
[65:19.17]The game you are playing right now, dude.
[65:23.10]Alright.
[65:23.46]I'm into it.
[65:31.45]Hey guys, give me like a good game that has a bunch of upgrades and it's like really fun and it's like tons of stuff to do and little things to collect.
[65:39.50]Yeah, I think, I don't think I'll play this game again.
[65:42.26]What I'm playing right now.
[65:43.14]Yeah, maybe like, I'll try it like later.
[65:45.10]It's like, it's this one.
[65:46.64]Alright, wait, what did I just get?
[65:50.72]Basic rifle, triple axle.
[65:55.45]This is worse than what I have on.
[66:06.68]Metroid?
[66:09.36]Oh, sorry.
[66:09.74]I've been sitting here silently.
[66:10.90]So how does it work?
[66:13.86]Oh, it's a gun.
[66:15.48]So wait, do I just... How much are these worth?
[66:39.85]If I should... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[66:41.59]It is like Red Dead, isn't it?
[66:44.81]This is definitely like Red Dead.
[66:47.47]I can destroy the meat, right?
[66:48.63]100%.
[66:50.54]I need one of those tanks.
[67:09.51]What's this?
[67:12.05]Ammo box.
[67:17.63]Orange juice just went up my nose.
[67:19.61]Stop making me laugh.
[67:20.75]Wait, you just you just distracted me and got me, you know.
[67:23.47]Hold on.
[67:29.05]I'm gonna die.
[67:44.79]Swimming Fat.
[67:51.81]I can't get the pot right now.
[67:53.05]Try Ilona.
[68:09.31]You actually brought them back.
[68:10.29]I guess I expected too little of you.
[68:12.23]This should do for now.
[68:13.59]Here's a reward.
[68:17.88]$70?
[68:18.54]Five olive oils?
[68:19.88]Hmm, five's always awesome.
[68:29.14]Animal Crossing is that game?
[68:33.53]Yeah, I have a really shit take that all of you are going to be mad about.
[68:38.29]But I just... I have a lot of trouble getting into Animal Crossing.
[68:44.57]Because every time I've ever played Animal... I play it at like 2 o'clock in the morning every single time.
[68:51.96]And it works on real time.
[68:54.44]So when I'm lying in bed, it's like, oh yeah, let me check on Animal Crossing.
[68:58.06]It's like 2 a.m.
[68:59.02]every day.
[69:01.76]It's just like, I can't really even do anything.
[69:04.58]And then it's like, well, just change the clock on your Wii or on your Switch.
[69:08.92]And it's like, I don't want to do that.
[69:12.82]I don't want to go into my settings and change the clock a day forward, go back out of the menu, go back into the game, reset the game, and... No.
[69:22.61]That is the solution.
[69:23.63]But then I forget about that, and it'll be like December.
[69:32.21]Not time traveling.
[69:38.71]I would love an Animal Crossing.
[69:41.09]Like Animal Crossing.
[69:41.97]I would love an Animal Crossing colon game.
[69:44.47]Do you know what I mean?
[69:46.18]Like Animal Crossing colon.
[69:48.40]Let's get to it.
[69:49.96]And it's just there's no time stuff.
[69:51.76]It's just.
[69:53.76]It's not like a main Animal Crossing game.
[69:56.14]You know what I'm saying?
[70:00.74]Animal Crossing, colon.
[70:02.36]Up and at them.
[70:03.92]And that, they call it that and it has the colon because it's a different game.
[70:07.94]You guys don't know, you guys make fun of me for grammar.
[70:14.17]You guys don't, I'm, a colon.
[70:15.71]Semi-colon, colon.
[70:16.79]Okay.
[70:18.91]You can decorate, that's cool.
[70:30.11]Animal Crossing, colon, New Horizons.
[70:35.81]They all have colons, don't they?
[70:38.00]Do they all have colons?
[70:40.60]Is it Animal Crossing, colon... Are they all?
[70:45.54]They have to be, right?
[70:46.38]Animal Crossing, colon... New Leaf or something, right?
[70:50.49]Animal Crossing, colon, New Horizons.
[70:52.23]Animal Crossing, colon... It's okay.
[71:15.96]When was the last time that they... Have they ever numbered Animal Crossing?
[71:20.71]No.
[71:25.87]Social media app?
[71:31.19]No, that would be silly.
[71:32.15]I love the theory of Animal Crossing.
[71:42.56]It's a wonderful theory, but for me, I'm just so... I play every game on my own time, not on stream, after, like, 12 o'clock every day.
[71:52.75]Midnight.
[72:00.58]And then I'll look up stuff about, oh, yeah, well, as long as you play at 9 a.m., this bug exists.
[72:07.40]And it's like, I...
[72:09.74]The first thing I do at 9 a.m., I'm going to forget.
[72:11.50]I'm not going to wake up and play Animal Crossing.
[72:14.54]I'm going to forget about that.
[72:23.90]Ever since the Zoombinis stream, I get mid-roll ads.
[72:30.59]You shouldn't be.
[72:31.31]I mean, I'm not running them.
[72:34.00]Oh, wait.
[72:34.44]Hold on a second.
[72:35.92]Oh, shit.
[72:36.34]I think you did probably get caught in the... I did run an ad when I was, like, fucking with everybody.
[72:44.47]I apologize about that.
[72:48.89]Yeah.
[72:49.71]It's possible that you joined right when I was doing that stupid, like, please play ad joke thing.
[72:58.56]Because I think that's when I did that.
[72:59.70]But if that's not the case, then I don't know.
[73:01.26]I'm not running on here.
[73:07.38]Okay, more customers will visit and new foods will be unlocked.
[73:09.73]65?
[73:09.75]65?
[73:09.81]No.
[73:10.01]I'll keep the one I have.
[73:37.14]Now I got to go into the app and post about the restaurant.
[73:39.98]Alright, I got to give it a like.
[73:49.61]Oh, I can do this.
[73:52.69]Rank up followers.
[73:54.57]I need 10 followers.
[74:02.00]So I just go through and like everything.
[74:11.05]Let's get the menu going.
[74:21.78]Ow.
[74:27.26]I don't know how to use social media.
[74:29.96]I just don't do it.
[74:30.55]I mean, I know how to use it, but I just don't.
[74:47.61]I got three mid-roll ads on the next best stream and one on this.
[74:50.71]I don't know what they're doing.
[74:54.97]Yeah, I'm.
[74:57.81]I'll look in my dashboard to make sure because I'm unless that's like automatically happening, it shouldn't be.
[75:01.55]Alright, menu 20 bucks.
[75:13.54]20 bucks, I got two of these now.
[75:23.93]Open.
[75:26.64]What is this ingredients?
[75:28.12]Oh, I can sell these just as they are.
[75:30.58]That's cool.
[75:34.50]Oh, because you open at night.
[75:41.41]Should I sell some of this?
[75:50.23]Might as well, just the stuff I'm not using.
[76:03.09]I'm not going to sell the condiments or anything though.
[76:06.69]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[76:11.77]Stop, don't sell, don't sell, don't sell.
[76:14.87]Actually a bad idea.
[76:15.69]Okay.
[76:18.13]Cat.
[76:25.96]Do you like the beach?
[76:27.10]I do.
[76:27.46]I haven't been in a long time though because obviously where I live.
[76:37.42]Okay.
[76:38.70]Uh, I'm gonna try to go down deep.
[76:41.64]I'm not picking up any boxes or anything.
[76:45.88]It's all a beach where you live.
[76:49.88]Well, I mean, beach implies water.
[76:57.83]There is no water.
[76:58.59]Dolphin.
[76:59.13]Dolphin.
[77:08.68]Dolphin.
[77:09.94]Should I follow it?
[77:13.71]Yeah.
[77:30.52]I'm not gonna shoot the dolphin with the harpoon.
[77:34.17]Relax.
[77:42.71]Pink dolphin is caught in the net.
[77:45.07]Do you guys have money?
[77:51.09]That's the noise I was waiting for.
[78:14.87]I was waiting for that.
[78:21.41]A gift.
[78:26.95]Pearl cool.
[78:29.51]Alright, I gotta go down to 70 meters.
[78:40.03]Wait, this is a this is better.
[78:45.75]Yeah, because they don't.
[78:46.59]It doesn't mess up the meat or anything.
[78:47.93]Alright, let's try that.
[78:48.77]Let me see.
[78:52.27]Oh, that's a great job.
[78:58.83]Alright, pick it up.
[79:01.45]How do I pick it up?
[79:03.43]There we go.
[79:04.38]Oh, this is a three star.
[79:13.80]I wonder, is this fish expensive?
[79:31.22]Underwater scooter.
[79:32.24]That's actually good to have right now.
[79:33.36]Alright, I'm going to just try to go fast to the bottom.
[79:39.37]Need to get to 70.
[79:39.73]I have to go back up.
[79:46.05]Escape pod?
[79:50.82]Escape pod.
[79:57.21]Let me get these fish here.
[80:10.79]Really?
[80:11.05]You're drowning.
[80:13.53]I have 25.
[80:13.71]I'm alright for now.
[80:23.19]This is an escape pod.
[80:24.23]Wait, is this not an escape pod?
[80:31.93]OK, alright, alright, right, right.
[80:33.05]Alright, I could have stayed down there a little longer.
[80:55.46]Okay.
[80:58.32]It's already evening.
[80:59.04]I feel stiff.
[80:59.88]Alright.
[81:00.52]I have a lot of materials.
[81:01.54]Play Assassin's Creed Black Flag.
[81:07.88]I made a video on Assassin's Creed Black Flag like seven years ago.
[81:17.89]I don't know how good the video is, but I made it.
[81:21.93]I don't really remember.
[81:26.69]It got an update.
[81:30.07]Is this a food critic?
[81:31.25]This place is getting popular on Cooksta.
[81:38.25]The name gave me pause, but to think it's really your place.
[81:41.89]New food using ever-before-seen ingredients.
[81:43.69]Can't taste this anywhere else.
[81:45.13]Did they mention me too?
[81:48.72]No, not really.
[81:51.28]What brings you all the way here?
[81:54.30]Wanna check out the restaurant?
[81:55.08]Looks like you're still the same.
[81:56.38]Okay.
[81:59.54]You refused to listen to me last time in a similar fashion, and that's what got you booted from the hotel.
[82:03.66]Talking about that again.
[82:08.49]It's the customer's fault for judging the food without even trying it.
[82:14.35]Who was the shit character from the Black Flag video that ended up in the Rumble?
[82:20.35]I... Wait.
[82:21.57]You're pulling out a memory here.
[82:26.30]I don't know.
[82:26.78]Those of you that don't know, there was a tradition on this channel, on YouTube and on Twitch, up until pretty recently, where I would, over the course of a year, every character that was kind of meaningful in any game or any kind of joke, they would all fight in a rumble at the end of the year.
[82:52.91]Um, and sometimes those characters, it'd be, it'd be like 20, 30, 40 of them sometimes.
[83:00.43]And it was like, I always wanted a lot.
[83:02.91]So it's like, wait, who can I even, who could I even have pull from?
[83:06.78]What game did I, did I play this last year?
[83:09.62]And sometimes you had to dig pretty deep.
[83:11.62]And that's how you get like the random captain from Assassin's Creed Black Flag.
[83:15.60]It's like, oh, I guess that guy, like somebody thought that guy was funny for a minute.
[83:19.93]So sometimes you have to really dig deep to find characters for the rumble.
[83:25.34]But they're always fun.
[83:32.71]Every serpent?
[83:33.65]Yeah, that was the filler arc for the Rumble, I think.
[83:38.91]Was all seven serpents from... When Sorcery, when I first did Sorcery, half of the entire roster of the Rumble was Sorcery characters.
[83:52.10]So many, I think it was half the Rumble.
[83:55.26]And then all the planets, yeah.
[83:56.98]Had to dig deep on that one.
[84:03.02]just not gonna do them ever again no I think what happened was the games got kind of like eh like the 2k games had like this crazy creation suite back in like the early 2010s into the mid 2010s and then it just kind of
[84:23.80]It became less like goofy and more kind of simulation based.
[84:28.46]And it's just like, oh, okay.
[84:31.30]And then after a while, you kind of, you've done it enough times.
[84:33.78]You kind of the same joke, start repeating over and over again.
[84:36.42]It's like, alright, that was fun.
[84:37.72]It needs to be fresh for me to want to do it again, I think.
[84:50.79]What about the live rumble?
[84:52.70]yeah that's that's been floating around for a long time it has been floating around for years at this point besides the one that I did on youtube I'll find a way to make it fresh and the the wrestling uh wrestling empire was sort of just like fun to play and mess around in okay

[86:49.04]Okay.
[86:54.26]What's the menu look like?
[86:55.50]Looks pretty good.
[87:11.69]What can I get here today?
[87:18.88]I don't have a shark head.
[87:19.84]Didn't you just watch us talk about how I don't have that?
[87:26.70]I thought you were a vegan furry.
[87:28.26]I'm leaving.
[87:28.78]Perfect pour.
[87:40.67]Watch this.
[87:48.15]Perfect pour.

[87:59.51]Furry.
[88:01.32]What was that again?
[88:02.04]I misread what somebody wrote in the chat.
[88:04.72]I don't remember.
[88:14.60]I'd like to come again.
[88:15.34]Nice.
[88:19.11]Somebody said very funny.
[88:22.13]Ah, that's what it was.
[88:24.43]Very funny.
[88:29.71]Yeah, I got kind of like all twisted up about it.
[88:33.13]I was like, what are you talking about?
[88:34.35]Like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[88:35.31]Why are you saying that to me?
[88:37.57]And they were just giving me a compliment.
[88:51.86]How do I misread it so much?
[88:58.02]Chat moves really fast.
[89:12.81]Okay.
[89:13.59]There's a new post?
[89:14.97]Should I make a post?
[89:15.81]I don't know.
[89:21.92]Do I really?
[89:22.28]I don't want to be the guy that likes every single post from everyone, right?
[89:26.27]Or do I?
[89:31.79]You know why I don't like to be that guy?
[89:33.57]Why I don't want to be that guy?
[89:35.23]Because if you don't do it, if I didn't, like, let's say Glenn came in and I didn't do it to Glenn.
[89:40.95]Like, I just didn't do it one day, but I did it for everyone else.
[89:43.44]That kind of makes me look like a shithead, doesn't it?
[89:46.70]Like, oh, why didn't they like my post?
[89:49.38]I saw you liked Luna's post and CCJY's post and Rose Pink's post, but you didn't, you didn't like mine.
[90:02.73]It's overthinking it.
[90:04.99]I don't think so.
[90:07.09]Overthinking social media.
[90:11.10]Social media is a fucked up place.
[90:13.00]What do you mean overthinking social media?
[90:25.02]Wait, do these people... Oh, alright.
[90:26.88]Let's call Dr. Bacon.
[90:31.34]Do the minigame app?
[90:32.94]Where's the minigame app?
[90:34.89]What?
[90:35.11]I don't have any games.
[90:48.61]Wait.
[90:52.54]Where is my... Oh, there it is.
[90:59.20]Okay, I definitely want this.
[91:03.70]Cargo box?
[91:04.48]I think that's what I want first.
[91:07.07]Upgrades.
[91:07.65]Upgrades.
[91:08.01]I love upgrades.
[91:21.48]Dr. Bacon is my goat.
[91:25.78]What would you do if the internet disappeared?
[91:27.22]I don't know.
[91:32.32]Find something else to fucking do?
[91:39.35]I need to go down to 70 meters.
[91:41.09]I keep not doing this.
[91:52.43]Goofy hammer.
[91:54.97]Rubber toy hammer doesn't do much damage, but something to put him to sleep.
[91:57.84]OK.
[92:03.26]Whoa.
[92:09.71]I got it.
[92:09.99]I got it.
[92:10.21]I got it.
[92:10.45]I got it.
[92:10.65]I got it.
[92:10.91]I got it.
[92:12.71]Leave me the fuck alone.
[92:13.39]I need to pick this thing up.
[92:14.99]What's going on?
[92:16.63]You piece of shit.
[92:17.98]I cannot believe what just happened.
[92:22.20]Leave me alone.
[92:28.67]What do you mean no?
[92:29.85]What?
[92:31.97]I can't pick it up?
[92:42.18]Is this gold or something?
[92:43.06]What is this?
[92:48.98]Dinosaur bones?
[92:53.54]Alright, I'm almost at 70.
[92:54.36]There's oxygen right here.
[93:16.00]Holy shit, I got lead.
[93:21.04]Should I be touching this?
[93:21.88]Okay, we're good.
[93:40.65]Alright, I gotta go down to 70 and look for artifacts.
[93:43.65]This might be one right here.
[93:48.27]Yep.
[93:50.73]OK.
[93:51.29]Text in my mother and I'm done.
[94:17.45]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[94:18.61]What was that just now?
[94:20.94]To go back to the boat.
[94:22.50]What?
[94:31.18]What is that?
[94:33.36]He thinks he's a funny guy.
[94:34.75]Well, I need to get rid of it.
[94:36.77]Should I attack this?
[94:39.13]I have a gun.
[95:00.47]There's some weird animals in the ocean.
[95:25.80]I gotta get some ingredients.
[95:36.21]What's that?
[95:39.83]What's that?
[95:46.70]Alright, I gotta go now.
[95:49.18]Get the big one?
[95:49.80]I can't.
[95:50.28]I need like a submarine or something.
[96:05.88]You can just kill the big one.
[96:06.94]What's your Twitch?
[96:08.24]twitch.tv/Jerma985.
[96:20.11]So what do I unlock for this?
[96:22.43]Okay.
[96:22.69]I'll be in touch.
[96:36.17]Can you link your Twitch?
[96:38.93]I don't know how to do that though.
[96:41.13]There's like a way to copy text and paste it.
[96:48.12]Magic.
[96:48.44]Alright, I think I have enough.
[96:59.94]New character.
[97:06.15]Hoppity hop.
[97:07.91]You do know a lot about this giant blue hole.
[97:10.25]Okay.
[97:12.87]It's the best place to collect... Marinka?
[97:18.35]Marinka.
[97:20.70]Trading cards.
[97:21.66]Marinka.
[97:26.96]Futuristic trading cards that utilize an AI recognition system that automatically corresponds to fish in real life.
[97:32.64]Never heard of it.
[97:33.56]You seem quite behind.
[97:37.52]Let me help you install the app.
[97:40.09]Do this, do this, do this.
[97:41.01]Done, done.
[97:41.47]Alright, alright.
[97:43.93]You don't really need to do anything special.
[97:45.95]Just catch a new fish and you'll get a card.
[97:48.07]Check the cards every now and then on the app and you're done.
[97:50.09]Okay.
[97:54.56]You don't want to be saying the name.
[97:55.64]I understand.
[97:56.08]I'll try it out.
[97:57.84]I'm Sato.
[97:58.84]Alright, cool.
[98:09.53]Marine cards.
[98:11.45]Fancier cards for catching higher grade fish.
[98:19.72]I got a lot of money.
[98:25.79]I'm going to upgrade the gun.
[98:26.89]Look at how much more damage that is.
[98:29.07]It's ridiculous.
[98:31.95]I used all my money, but it was worth it.
[98:48.48]I love upgrades.
[98:49.44]I really do.
[98:58.59]So what's an expensive fish of these?
[99:00.91]I guess I could just look.
[99:02.37]I should just get as many as I can, really.
[99:24.14]What about a seahorse?
[99:26.70]I don't want to kill the seahorse.
[99:28.20]Is that weird?
[99:31.79]Oh, I can't even.
[99:32.35]There we go.
[99:42.11]These are expensive.
[99:53.66]iron these redfish they have a lot of utilization damn it damn it I'm playing with a controller so that's my excuse
[100:28.25]Oxygen capsule.
[100:30.93]That's helpful.
[100:42.04]Wood.
[100:48.56]Lightning harpoon.
[100:49.48]Harpoon tip charged with high voltage.
[100:52.28]Chain damage.
[100:54.83]Oh shit.
[101:03.73]Did that not work?
[101:04.81]Whoa, what's happening?
[101:12.12]Whoa.
[101:27.57]This must be shocking things around.
[101:29.03]Oh, hold on.
[101:29.85]I'm running out of, uh, you know,
[101:40.77]I gotta go up.
[101:48.03]Will I keep this oxygen capsule till later?
[101:53.29]If I can make it all the way up.
[101:58.79]No.
[102:02.79]What do I have to get rid of?
[102:03.81]I don't want rope.
[102:14.28]This thing is... I mean, it's alright.
[102:16.68]It weighs a lot.
[102:28.59]Eh, whatever.
[102:40.14]What if you sneeze underwater like this?
[102:45.56]Excuse me.
[102:53.70]Yes, it was real.
[103:09.62]Should make some good money.
[103:23.10]This dude just sneezed for attention.
[103:28.86]That's a wild sentence.
[103:39.49]That is an insane sentence.
[103:54.52]Let's upgrade, upgrade everything.
[104:08.01]Upgrade it again.
[104:15.45]Upgrade everything.
[104:37.21]What is Omega Lull?
[104:40.92]It means... It means... Happy birthday.
[104:57.95]It's usually somebody's birthday that they're saying happy birthday to.
[105:11.08]A lot of birthdays today.
[105:12.96]You really had to dig for that one.
[105:15.93]It's a, um... It means, uh... It means, uh... Happy birthday.
[105:25.25]See, there would be a cut there.
[105:27.13]This is live.
[105:29.97]We're live.
[105:30.57]It would be like, what's Omegalo?
[105:34.91]Well, happy birthday.
[105:36.01]He just didn't get the audio cut, and that's alright.
[105:57.20]That tea is chunky.
[105:58.26]Yeah, it is.
[106:13.81]Clean quick.
[106:26.87]How's the progress on the video you're making?
[106:29.70]Steady.
[106:32.42]Steady.
[106:35.56]Got new food.
[106:46.25]A kitchen staff.
[106:59.67]Is this video 10 years in the making?
[107:03.55]Not really.
[107:08.55]When it comes out, you'll know.
[107:10.77]But we'll do a premiere.
[107:16.55]Made a lot more money today.
[107:25.13]Can you do an impression of Jerma985?
[107:26.73]I could try.
[107:28.05]I don't know him that well, but let me see.
[107:33.16]I mean, what about the aliens?
[107:35.30]Just aliens?
[107:36.24]How do we even tell the aliens that we're people?
[107:39.96]How can we possibly describe electricity to the aliens?
[107:43.07]He kind of talks like that, doesn't he?
[107:44.07]That's not bad.
[107:50.65]That was not really close.
[107:58.20]Well, I don't fucking know the guy.
[107:59.46]You're acting like I know this guy.
[108:04.86]Just one off-the-cuff message from chat and I'm just trying to... I don't know this person.
[108:09.72]Oh, I got a radar.
[108:23.00]Your voice wasn't nasally enough?
[108:24.82]Nasally?
[108:27.22]Do I have a nasally voice?
[108:30.56]No, I don't.
[108:31.18]Do I?
[108:33.29]My voice is not nasally?
[108:35.31]Nasally.
[108:36.55]You mean nasally like this.
[108:39.36]Like that?
[108:40.02]I don't have a nasally voice.
[108:43.42]How do we tell him?
[108:50.71]Let's test the radar.
[108:54.85]Okay.
[109:03.17]His voice is way milkier than that.
[109:07.06]I know.
[109:08.96]I agree.
[109:09.44]He doesn't have... He didn't do the velvety, buttery voice that he had.
[109:33.38]Buttery.
[109:34.90]I don't like when voices are described as buttery.
[109:38.20]It's just like, ugh, stop.
[109:41.83]He's got a smooth, buttery voice.
[109:45.17]Butter, I only want it on fucking toast.
[109:47.93]Stop everywhere else.
[109:50.13]Unless it's like for, you know, obviously... Just don't make butter a description for talking, is what I mean.
[110:02.58]Follow the dolphin again.
[110:20.80]Again?
[110:21.14]Pirates must have captured it illegally.
[110:32.45]Somebody just shot me with a gun.
[110:34.71]Who just shot me?
[110:35.53]Some people are shooting at me?
[110:36.63]They'll shoot back.
[110:41.22]What's up, bro?
[110:45.54]Oh, I can't.
[111:01.66]Fuck you!
[111:02.86]Fuck you!
[111:05.80]You haven't... What did you say?
[111:24.06]You have a Morgan Freeman voice.
[111:34.86]I wish I could have it on repeat.
[111:38.10]It's always the same thing.
[111:46.86]I could probably speak dolphin.
[111:47.98]If you put me with some dolphins, and I would just like... I would get viciously fucking murdered.
[111:56.74]And they would rip out my eyes and eat all my organs and shit.
[112:03.07]Gold bar?
[112:13.83]That's pretty huge.
[112:26.89]I want to find something new.
[112:30.61]This is kind of new.
[112:32.17]Have I had a pink fish before?
[112:36.63]A sea goldie.
[112:48.22]Can you make a real dolphin noise?
[112:55.85]Blueprint.
[112:58.95]Nice, that's a big deal.
[113:02.65]Need to get a shark.
[113:03.77]How deep do I have to go for a shark?
[113:10.70]Nice alright, find a shark.
[113:16.88]That's not a shark, is it?
[113:19.30]No, that's a salmon.
[113:33.41]These things have a lot of health.
[113:40.15]Hey.
[113:52.44]Salmon, right?
[113:54.14]Mackerel.
[114:00.46]Don't bite me.
[114:00.96]I thought it was going to bite me.
[114:04.91]Well, now I want that.
[114:21.96]Give me this.
[114:22.32]I need this for my award-winning restaurant.
[114:26.64]My accolades.
[114:27.32]Alright, I gotta go up.
[114:35.63]Not before I pick up this, though.
[114:44.94]Why is he doing the Pac-Man confused thing from the Pac-Man game?
[114:51.34]Look, look.
[115:00.36]I can't drop anything.
[115:01.10]I just gotta go.
[115:14.14]Dave is going to die.
[115:19.85]Dave is going to be fine.
[115:44.10]You're in the ocean.
[115:46.21]Pirates.
[115:52.93]Sharks usually are near the surface.
[115:54.51]I'll check it out after this.
[115:59.89]What is that Pac-Man game called?
[116:01.37]Pac-Man like the New Adventures or something, right?
[116:05.35]Super Nintendo is a side-scrolling game.
[116:08.55]It was bizarre.
[116:13.09]It's a game where you had to tell Pac-Man to go... You had to control him with voice commands from a narrator.
[116:23.77]And he was just sort of this weird childlike wonder where he would walk around and just look at stuff.
[116:28.01]And he would get really distracted.
[116:33.73]Be like, Pac-Man, go right!
[116:35.03]And he would just be like, and he would just go look at a butterfly.
[116:39.00]It was a really bizarre game.
[116:42.40]I made a video on it, but maybe one day I would stream it just because it's so strange.
[116:46.05]I feel like everyone needs to see it.
[116:56.73]Okay, looking for a shark.
[116:58.43]I have a gun.
[117:05.08]Check the right side is what people were saying.
[117:13.60]I could swim down with what the radar is pointing me to.
[117:15.55]Uh, that's way better.
[117:34.46]It was from your What the Fuck series.
[117:40.52]Pretty good one.
[117:52.01]Is this copper?
[117:57.03]Okay, cool.
[117:58.07]These are heavy though.
[118:07.00]Nah, I don't want it.
[118:08.67]Alright, where's this shark?
[118:23.94]Okay, olive oil.
[118:27.58]How long can you hold your breath?
[118:30.72]Um... Probably not as short as you think.
[118:46.15]Two seconds.
[118:46.69]I mean, I don't really care to try, but... What's the average?
[118:57.82]average hold on average you know adult male that whatever what's like the average 30 you know let's just say 35 year old one to two minutes
[119:28.46]This thing looks kind of... This thing's glowing, isn't it?
[119:33.90]No.
[119:34.04]30 to 90 seconds.
[119:39.98]There's a difference to me of holding my breath underwater versus holding my breath just sitting here.
[119:46.88]I feel like I can hold it for much longer in water.
[119:50.48]Does that make sense?
[119:57.01]Is there any scientific reason for that?
[120:00.38]Alright, I went all the way right.
[120:01.28]I don't see a shark.
[120:03.03]That's an actual thing.
[120:17.05]I'm going to pick this up and then go down.
[120:26.34]Although I do want these to sell for a lot.
[120:30.09]What the hell just happened?
[120:37.62]Underwater, you're not absorbing any oxygen through the skin.
[120:44.78]That's not correct.
[120:47.96]I don't think.
[120:48.36]I don't think that's correct.
[120:54.72]Why did I think that was real for one second?
[120:57.26]Shock!
[120:57.84]Shock!
[120:58.52]Shock!
[121:15.65]This is mine.
[121:20.10]Alright, I gotta get up.
[121:29.35]I guess I could get some of these.
[121:31.25]Hold on.
[121:37.43]I'm just going right up here anyways.
[121:38.45]What about the jellyfish?
[121:47.44]That's one star.
[121:48.34]I didn't use a gun.
[121:48.98]Plenty of factors like pressure, movement and exertion and energy, free diving or other types of swimming, also depending on the amount of oxygen percentages you take in.
[122:13.88]Hey, just got here.
[122:14.50]Can you please tell me to fuck off?
[122:15.66]Thanks in advance.
[122:16.36]Get the fuck out of here.
[122:33.91]I like the sniper rifle.
[122:43.56]We got a good menu tonight.
[122:44.56]This is gonna be good.
[122:53.53]I bet I could do 60 seconds.
[123:02.25]Salt grilled.
[123:03.83]Ooh.
[123:06.25]This is a good one.
[123:06.89]48 coins.
[123:34.14]Let's do them all.
[123:38.10]Those things are so easy to get to.
[123:39.44]OK, so what can I do now?
[123:50.53]What do we got?
[123:53.45]This one.
[123:53.96]This one is going on the menu because that's what the food critic wants.
[124:04.48]I'm not going to upgrade it.
[124:10.54]Okay.
[124:12.44]Salt.
[124:13.08]Where did I get salt?
[124:24.31]From the ocean?
[124:32.21]I calculated based on your height and body weight and other factors, it is impossible for you to hold your breath for 60 seconds.
[124:40.23]You're a smart chatter.
[124:43.37]You are... You are tapping into insecurities of mine to prove, without me doing it, that I can't do that.
[124:52.94]So, like, I calculated based on your height and, like, your weight and everything.
[124:56.70]Oh, you must have calculated it.
[124:57.80]Alright, bro.
[124:58.70]I'll prove you wrong.
[124:59.82]I know it's a very good attempt.
[125:02.72]It was a really good attempt.
[125:05.38]Because you think, oh, well, fuck you.
[125:17.47]I'm going to go on full cam and hold my breath till I turn fucking purple.
[125:20.59]Like, no, I'm not going to do that.
[125:38.17]Yeah, I don't think I would have very much fun holding my breath as long as I could.
[125:43.52]No, I'm just like playing Dave the Diver, you know?
[125:46.32]I'm just kind of hanging out.
[125:47.66]I don't think I want to hold my breath.
[125:49.28]There's a lot of people here.
[125:57.61]Disgusting as usual?
[126:13.17]Apparently not disgusting.
[126:19.19]Yeah, don't hold your breath.
[126:21.88]Breathe.
[126:23.64]Don't be an idiot.
[126:25.02]Don't be stupid, right?
[126:26.98]I'm going to hold my breath as long.
[126:27.98]Don't do that.
[126:29.18]Don't be stupid.
[126:29.78]She really likes it.
[126:42.58]It is lovely.
[126:43.44]The book of five rings states that one should look at the essence of something instead of its appearance.
[126:58.85]You pass.
[127:02.91]Just pretend you're holding your breath.
[127:04.05]How would chat even know?
[127:13.07]We mean go on cam and take a big and puff my cheeks out, but I'm just breathing through my nose the whole time.
[127:19.49]I have a counter going in the corner.
[127:32.14]It's being like, I try to communicate.
[127:38.64]That'd be such dog shit.
[127:44.13]How long can I hold my breath?
[127:51.80]Take a phone call.
[127:58.10]And do the thing where it's like, yeah, sorry, man.
[128:00.10]I really gotta go.
[128:02.08]I gotta go.
[128:02.60]I'm doing a thing on stream.
[128:04.16]I gotta go.
[128:04.52]Okay, bye.
[128:07.82]Then puff the cheeks out again.
[128:15.31]Do it without a facecam.
[128:16.55]Alright, you guys ready?
[128:17.29]Time me.
[128:18.09]How long can I hold my breath for?
[128:19.35]You ready?
[128:30.97]Oh, that had to be like a minute.
[128:33.09]How long was that?
[128:36.65]Jeez.
[128:37.49]How long was that?
[128:41.14]Come in, you.
[128:44.83]10 seconds?
[128:45.27]That's gotta be a record.
[128:47.33]Dude, just take a screenshot of your face with your cheeks puffed out and closing your nose with a timer going.
[129:03.21]Like, hey, I'm doing it right now.
[129:09.17]How long can I hold?
[129:09.87]But I'm still talking over the stream.
[129:11.71]It doesn't make any sense.
[129:14.56]I am... Going for... Right, going for world record.
[129:20.16]Play in silence.
[129:32.65]Oh, I really wish I had clothing on.
[129:34.69]I wish I had a shirt on right now.
[129:37.09]And I am fucking gross.
[129:39.55]I... Oh, man.
[129:40.99]I have to, like... I feel kind of like shit, too.
[129:45.84]Like, this is not the day.
[129:46.82]Alright, save this.
[129:51.54]I promise I will do this on the next stream.
[129:55.73]Wait, the next stream is going to be the House Flipper invitational joke thing.
[130:00.84]Maybe I'll just do it on there and just fucking everyone will think I'm a weirdo.
[130:05.62]We already have a screenshot?
[130:07.95]Wait, why do you... I hate this picture though.
[130:11.83]Anyone else?
[130:16.79]This one could do it.
[130:21.82]This image does not convey I'm holding my breath.
[130:33.62]This is I'm holding in laughter.
[130:36.60]Oh, that thing was so funny, but I can't laugh because then I'll lose.
[130:40.54]No, that's not holding my breath.
[130:44.02]That's you laugh, you lose.
[130:45.68]I like this one.
[130:55.30]This one's so stupid.
[131:00.90]How long can I hold my breath for?
[131:39.69]I can't.
[131:40.13]It's not even close.
[131:42.69]I am wicked red in this.
[131:48.24]This one is fucked.
[131:50.32]Okay, this is definitely the one.
[132:00.49]This is absolutely the one.
[132:09.55]Okay, so then now hold on
[132:51.82]Okay, there needs to be a timer.
[132:53.00]Hold on.
[133:01.62]Hold on a second.
[133:02.30]Let me get a timer.
[133:07.50]Okay, stopwatch.
[133:21.99]Well, no, not a... It needs to be, yeah, like this.
[133:29.36]This is... Okay, I like it, though.
[133:34.58]Okay, hold on.
[133:41.30]Is this one... No, not that one.
[133:48.49]This one?
[133:50.35]There it is.
[133:53.32]We gotta prepare this.
[133:54.30]It's very important.
[133:55.04]Okay.
[134:08.76]I'm just cropping it so you can see it better.
[134:52.80]Alright, you ready?
[134:53.30]Alright, I'm going for it.
[134:59.74]Let's see how long I can do it for.
[135:27.55]I tell you, we're going to have a huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge,
[136:00.05]I don't want that.
[136:10.06]Hey, you look ugly.
[136:12.78]You look ugly.
[136:57.85]Hey, what's up?
[137:01.19]Yeah, I'm in the middle of streaming.
[137:05.63]Yeah, I'll call you in like a couple hours.
[137:08.56]Yeah.
[137:11.22]Alright, dude.
[137:13.56]Yeah, I'm streaming.
[137:14.72]Alright, bye.
[137:46.38]time what's that 241 come on and a phone call in the middle yeah that was funny that's literally nothing
[138:14.16]That's a lot.
[138:15.84]If I were to actually do it.
[138:16.82]Don't try that at home, by the way.
[138:18.52]You can actually hurt yourself doing that.
[138:20.50]Don't fuck around.
[138:21.04]It's a funny bit, but don't fuck around.
[138:24.92]It's actually kind of dangerous to do that to yourself.
[138:32.48]Alright, I need to... It's alright.
[138:37.67]Okay, mom.
[138:40.95]I just want to make sure people understand that.
[138:44.57]OK, that makes me mom.
[138:47.48]Then that makes me mom.
[138:49.00]But I'm going to say.
[138:58.36]OK, look at it, all this is all ruined now.
[139:08.81]No, it's the most expensive thing on the menu.
[139:10.43]Oh, but it's right here.
[139:12.07]It's right here.
[139:12.73]No.
[139:13.77]No, I just... It's like when somebody's towing your car and you walk out and you're just like, I'm fucking right here.
[139:20.15]God damn it.
[139:28.46]Who even ordered this?
[139:32.72]Who ordered this?
[139:35.84]Why did he make this?
[139:41.85]Oh, my God.
[139:42.49]It's because we did a little routine.
[139:44.64]I had it up the whole time.
[139:46.62]It was a little routine we did.
[139:48.60]Alright.
[139:52.26]You can't say that that's... Oh, he's so bad.
[139:54.40]He's so bad.
[139:55.10]I literally stopped in the middle of that to do a... I'm going for the Breath World record joke.
[140:12.03]Can I guess where this is from?
[140:17.11]This is from WarioWare, isn't it?
[140:23.59]This is a I'm mad at WarioWare face.
[140:25.95]Is that wrong?
[140:33.66]Rhythm Heaven.
[140:34.20]Yep, okay.
[140:35.34]Same kind of genre.
[140:37.58]Yeah, same genre.
[140:41.02]Okay.
[140:49.38]You were holding your breath the whole Wario stream?
[140:53.75]Nah.
[140:55.39]Okay.
[140:59.30]You really are impossible.
[141:01.58]Blue shells and brown shells.
[141:10.96]I can't understand your underlying anatomy in this picture.
[141:13.74]What is your neck doing?
[141:18.40]Well, we can examine it if you want.
[141:26.03]So that's that's my chin.
[141:30.81]It's not my neck.
[141:34.02]This is where my face kind of ends, but there's more face.
[141:39.54]That is really strange looking, isn't it?
[141:43.18]This is my chin.
[141:44.52]That's the bottom of my chin.
[141:49.04]See?
[141:51.26]I have created a second face on top of my face.
[141:54.64]That's gotta be worth something, right?
[141:58.88]That's gotta be worth something.
[142:09.31]Like a turtle going back into its shell.
[142:17.72]I might just do air twice.
[142:19.78]Oh, I need 400.
[142:25.22]I'll save the rest.
[142:27.69]Or... Can be crafted.
[142:31.27]Should I make this?
[142:37.09]You're wilding in the morning.
[142:38.62]I see why you stream later.
[142:39.96]I feel like I've been pretty chilled out and kind of low-key this stream.
[142:46.80]What do you mean?
[142:48.04]I think I've been kind of relaxing this whole time.
[142:54.15]This is a little more toned, like dialed down, like toned down.
[143:01.51]Should I make this?
[143:02.11]I already have one, don't I?
[143:10.73]You ever gonna go back to Final Fantasy 16?
[143:13.53]I want to.
[143:15.49]But I think I'm gonna... I think I'm just gonna stream it.
[143:17.95]I'm gonna play it on my own time.
[143:19.48]Stream it on my own time?
[143:25.90]I don't know.
[143:30.44]Should I have crafted that?
[143:31.32]I will.
[143:45.99]I was looking forward to it.
[143:50.07]I haven't completely ruled it out.
[143:52.99]Just not.
[143:56.39]There's like just other things that I, for instance, the next time I'm streaming is Monday and that's the House Flipper invitational stream.
[144:05.62]So it would have to be after that.
[144:12.70]Oh, a lot of people weren't here.
[144:14.92]I can talk about it again.
[144:15.64]Actually, let me go over a few really important things.
[144:18.16]Because I think a lot of people trickled in over the last hour or two.
[144:21.40]In like 30 minutes or so, we are going to raid CDawg, Connor's stream.
[144:29.86]Connor is doing a charity auction stream today.
[144:34.12]And I have two different bundles in the event.
[144:40.25]Two Grotto Beasts themed items, bundles.
[144:43.26]One of them's a raffle, one of them's an auction.
[144:51.02]That is where you are going.
[144:52.35]It's all benefiting the Immune Deficiency Foundation.
[144:59.99]A lot of items.
[145:01.57]I'm not the only one.
[145:02.43]There is, I believe, dozens and dozens and dozens of items from different streamers and YouTubers that are going up for auction and raffle.
[145:15.69]And I think my raffle, my item, I think is going to be pretty early in the show.
[145:23.98]So make sure you go check that out.
[145:30.97]not the face mold I told you no one's getting that in fact I I might just destroy it it's really possible that I just destroy it because it's like nobody can have this it's just too just far too powerful of an object I might just crush it you know what I mean like I I know but that can't exist
[145:58.92]But that's what's happening today.
[146:00.84]Go support that stream.
[146:05.92]Regardless of there's items of mine that are in it.
[146:10.79]You got some time, please support it.
[146:14.65]Also, on Monday, July 3rd, we're doing a House Flipper invitational joke.
[146:23.26]It is not like actually officially endorsed by anything.
[146:26.42]Just me.
[146:29.40]And I got rewards for this.
[146:31.35]Okay.
[146:36.57]Uh, yeah.
[146:37.55]So I'm going to, I'm trying to get like somewhere between five and 10 streamers.
[146:41.01]I've already reached out to a bunch of people already.
[146:45.47]We're going to do a House Flipper flip off where everybody gets about 60 to 90 minutes.
[146:53.02]Everyone starts at the same time and everyone starts at the same house.
[146:58.33]And then it's pencils down.
[147:01.17]Give me a tour now of your house.
[147:04.37]And I'm going to be grading them on creativity, complexity, philosophy, theming, structural integrity, cleanliness.
[147:11.68]I have an entire system.
[147:14.28]And there is the object I need right there.
[147:28.64]Explain philosophy.
[147:31.48]Your design philosophy.
[147:42.85]This is my grading system, okay?
[147:45.35]You make your own grading system.
[147:50.08]Yeah, there's a few more people I'm going to reach out to this weekend.
[147:54.04]Tonight and tomorrow.
[147:57.77]I think it's going to be a really fun time.
[147:59.15]I think it's going to be just jokey.
[148:00.59]Fun.
[148:03.57]Not going to be too serious.
[148:05.61]Just to have some fun.
[148:12.13]What are you going to stream on your end?
[148:15.35]Dave the Diver.
[148:21.60]Now, I'll probably hang out in House Flipper.
[148:26.13]and sort of make my own, maybe?
[148:29.06]Or just kind of be chilling out, painting walls?
[148:49.71]Yeah, I am.
[148:52.27]Those of you that know me and those that have been invited or will be invited.
[148:58.47]Why can I not catch this?
[149:02.23]There's a specific criteria that you should probably be following.
[149:05.72]I'm not going to tell you how to make your house or anything, but I cannot catch this.
[149:12.88]A long time.
[149:21.65]I'm still contemplating if I want theming, right?
[149:27.12]I give like a couple of words.
[149:29.50]Let's just say I'm not going to use these because I don't want to, you know, this is not a leak.
[149:33.04]Let's just say that it was like, okay, and here is your house and your words are sunshine, dog food, and pickles.
[149:44.93]What does that mean?
[149:46.49]You tell me.
[149:48.09]You tell me what that means.
[149:55.90]That's a leak.
[149:56.74]No, it's not.
[149:57.24]I'm not going to use those.
[149:58.30]I need one more blue shell and we're good.
[150:09.72]But... I don't think I can get it.
[150:33.27]What brand of dog food did you have for breakfast today?
[150:42.78]I actually had a coffee and that was it.
[150:46.52]As of right now.
[150:53.10]I want to go deeper.
[150:54.92]No more of this, you know, like 50 meters Andy.
[150:58.58]I want to go down to like 150.
[151:02.09]That's not breakfast, dude.
[151:03.05]Eat something.
[151:03.73]I usually do.
[151:04.37]I usually do.
[151:04.92]I usually do.
[151:06.38]I'll be alright, don't worry.
[151:07.36]It's been like two hours, three hours.
[151:08.58]I usually will have some kefir.
[151:16.32]If you're a long time viewer of this channel, you know that kefir is a drink that I very much enjoy.
[151:31.67]He's always loved kefir.
[151:32.69]Of course I have.
[151:34.41]Very great thing to consume.
[151:36.61]Good for you.
[151:37.83]Doesn't have any really like bullshit in it.
[151:42.00]Your digestive track.
[151:44.88]I need that now.
[151:47.24]You have peach flavored.
[151:50.94]I like blueberry.
[151:52.48]If you're myself.
[152:00.15]Too much kefir will cause kidney stones.
[152:12.39]You're not going to be one of those people that's like, hey, you know that if you eat too many apples, it gives you, you know, fucking diarrhea.
[152:19.59]I'm not going to eat 10 apples.
[152:22.62]You said you love apples.
[152:24.26]I do like apples.
[152:25.86]You must eat three every day.
[152:28.67]I don't.
[152:29.61]Well, why'd you say that then?
[152:30.41]You don't love apples then.
[152:31.51]I do.
[152:32.23]Well, then you must eat ten a day.
[152:33.53]I don't.
[152:33.85]Do you think I can take them?

[154:03.64]Drink a whole kefir right now.
[154:11.90]It's really good.

[154:16.86]Is that person full of shit?
[154:29.15]It's bullshit.

[154:31.25]It's yogurt.
[154:34.35]It's yogurt adjacent.
[154:36.19]It's a yogurt cousin.
[154:38.09]It's not.
[154:39.29]It's yogurt.
[154:49.14]Okay.
[154:52.48]Research level gain.
[154:54.46]Eco watcher.
[154:56.57]Mission based app made to protect the environment.
[154:58.48]Get points for completing missions on the app and get rewards for reaching certain levels.
[155:06.20]This was for points on the app, not for a paper.
[155:08.67]Oh, dear.
[155:15.63]Dude, kefir is a treatment for kidney stones.
[155:19.39]There's a lot of just misinformation in this chat right now.
[155:22.67]I need a verified source.
[155:24.75]It can't just be like fucking like Greg.
[155:29.20]Kefir.
[155:33.38]Kidney stones.
[155:35.36]I need to see what's going on here.
[155:42.22]good it's good for you don't listen to anybody it literally helps with that it helps with that web md wilson I I don't know do you trust like bill from the subway or web md I don't know which one of those do you choose
[156:17.16]Kefir is good for you and will help alleviate some gut bacteria issues and is good for you and can help break up potential kidney stones.
[156:28.09]Hey, that shit gives you kidney stones.
[156:30.43]Don't listen to that fucking idiot.
[156:32.35]That's a liar.
[156:38.22]I would trust a real doctor and not a website.
[156:43.06]You can't make an appointment to the doctor.
[156:46.24]Call the doctor.
[156:47.06]You can't call the doctor and say, hey, doctor, hi, I'd like to have an appointment.
[156:50.60]Okay, what are you coming in for?
[156:51.98]Well, you see, I just want to ask you a question.
[156:55.67]What do you, okay, are you having any symptoms?
[156:58.29]No, I don't have any symptoms.
[156:59.73]Well, what are you doing here?
[157:01.47]Well, you see, does kefir cause kidney stones?
[157:07.15]No.
[157:07.73]Okay, you feel okay?
[157:09.25]I feel great.
[157:09.99]Okay, bye.
[157:11.51]That's not how, you don't, you can't make it a, you don't go to like urgent care to ask that question.
[157:23.30]That's what your primary care doctor is for.
[157:25.26]Yeah, when you have an appointment, like a physical... Yeah, go ahead and ask it.
[157:28.87]But to make an appointment specifically to ask the doctor if eating watermelon will give you gas.
[157:37.05]It's like... I don't think that's a symptom.
[157:50.08]Getting a little scared of your kefir consumption levels?
[157:52.56]Hmm...
[158:01.27]This is my favorite.
[158:04.23]Okay, we need another staff member.
[158:17.60]Kitchen or dining area?
[158:18.81]Probably dining area.
[158:25.25]Cool.
[158:29.99]Training to consider.
[158:34.00]This is a lot deeper than I thought.
[158:35.06]This is a game where you swim around and collect fish.
[158:37.34]This is much deeper than I thought it was going to be.
[158:45.17]I like it.
[158:45.59]150 to train.
[158:45.99]Let's do it.
[158:58.05]Not too much and not too little.
[159:04.59]Yeah, do you guys honestly think the guy who has said Ben Franklin's name probably more than every Twitch streamer on this website combined ever, do you think is going to argue for like over consuming something?
[159:19.58]Ooh, I got 10 of these.
[159:37.06]He's in hell.
[159:37.58]That's fine.
[159:38.26]He's in hell.
[159:38.94]Whatever.
[159:44.14]Whatever.
[159:44.45]I... What do you want to say?
[160:00.95]This dude takes advice from hell dwellers.
[160:04.74]A hell dweller.
[160:06.49]That's an interesting term.
[160:08.69]Hell dweller.
[160:09.47]Alright, this thing is... Look at the money I'm going to get from this.
[160:32.92]I guess stop picking these up.
[160:34.02]They're not worth anything anymore.
[160:35.10]I like the way your earlobes stick out.
[160:43.37]Have a great stream.
[160:44.25]Hey, thanks.
[160:45.93]First time chatter.
[160:47.46]First thing you ever said.
[160:49.94]Actually, thank you.
[160:50.92]That's a compliment.
[160:53.40]Usually the first time chatters say, hey, are you that guy that did X?
[160:57.82]Are you that guy that did this?
[161:00.16]I'm not even playing the fucking game anymore.
[161:01.98]Like, you see what's going on?
[161:05.80]Are you the sus guy?
[161:06.78]Are you the guy that did X?
[161:07.78]Are you the guy that did Y?
[161:10.62]Right?
[161:10.90]Like, are you that guy?
[161:11.58]I hate that guy.
[161:23.00]Somebody, where's the, I should have put the person in the kitchen.
[161:25.54]Because I, I don't, there's not enough food to go around.
[161:30.96]There's not enough food to go around.
[161:57.66]By the way, don't I have a staff member?
[161:59.38]What is going on?
[162:00.00]Where are they?
[162:06.30]Thank you.
[162:07.36]Thank you.
[162:07.74]Actually, nice job.
[162:22.30]Staff is asking for a raise.
[162:28.24]I have to return to that game one day.
[162:30.14]It's been long enough, I think.
[162:38.73]I'm afraid to play Casino Inc.
[162:40.13]because I feel like that's... It's like the peak of my entire Twitch career was how much fun I had in that game.
[162:48.59]And I'm scared that I'll go back and taint it.
[162:54.46]It almost lives as this perfect memory in my brain that I kind of don't want to mess with it.
[163:02.10]Okay.
[163:09.77]Management app.
[163:11.11]Which works on your smartphone.
[163:14.89]Cool.
[163:18.80]Sounds handy.
[163:22.96]Management app.
[163:29.92]All these apps.
[163:30.46]I think we're doing pretty good.
[163:47.09]Can never be replicated again.
[163:48.25]The fire happening after waiting for it was the best build up and payoff that can never be replicated.
[163:52.25]Yeah.
[163:55.08]yeah at some point you know when you're doing a sequel and you're just kind of grasping for that how much fun you had and the sequel is just kind of like it was okay we kind of remembered some of the funny things it's kind of funny because that's like my worst enemy is not wanting to do things more than once um
[164:23.81]A lot of the shows and like events and stuff that you've seen, I was just like, no, I don't want to do this again.
[164:30.03]Like I want to do something else.
[164:31.71]And it's kind of a detriment because it's like, well, would you ever want to do like six or 10 episodes of that?
[164:38.63]And I'm just like, no, not really.
[164:40.17]And it's kind of a detriment sometimes.
[164:46.58]Can I get this now?
[164:53.53]That was sad.
[164:54.25]That was really sad.
[164:55.51]I just shot this fish in the fucking head.
[164:57.35]That was like sad.
[164:58.35]That was kind of sad.
[165:03.85]Am I poisoned?
[165:08.91]Alright, I'm going down deeper.
[165:19.21]I get bored incredibly easily.
[165:23.32]So, and plus, I don't know.
[165:25.84]I feel like there's other ideas I like and I want to do.
[165:28.38]I feel like each thing that I do is fun to have it live sort of in a little bubble on its own.
[165:38.31]It's typically how I feel.
[165:39.29]And this thing is aggressive.
[165:55.99]Do not.
[165:59.61]Please don't.
[166:07.30]Barracuda.
[166:12.51]I want a squid.
[166:27.19]I don't think I've even found one of these yet.
[166:38.96]Yeah, is Connor stream live right now?
[166:40.92]Or is it starting soon?
[166:41.84]10 minutes, yeah.
[166:50.34]Again, if you don't know what's going on in 10 minutes, I'm going to dump you all over on CDawg on Connor's channel.
[166:58.13]There's a whole big charity auction stream going on today.
[167:01.03]I have a couple of items that are included.
[167:05.21]One bundle is for the auction.
[167:07.09]One bundle is for a raffle.
[167:10.65]So I believe they're doing my raffle bundle pretty early, I think, on the show.
[167:25.18]Alright, last one and I'm gonna go.
[167:26.24]I feel like this game is for Marvel nerds?
[167:38.85]Marvel nerds?
[167:44.24]I mean, why are you truing that?
[167:46.56]Marvel nerds?
[167:50.33]I think it's just a fun game about diving in the ocean and collecting fish and stuff.
[167:55.72]Where are you getting that from?
[168:04.94]Activate?
[168:09.62]These are mines.
[168:10.46]Alright, actually, I gotta go up.
[168:14.94]I might be in trouble.
[168:17.17]Is this the ceiling?
[168:18.79]Thank god.
[168:22.01]Hurry hurry hurry.
[168:51.16]Kind of rude.
[168:52.54]Like what?
[168:57.16]It just exploded.
[168:57.96]That's like... I'm fine!
[169:08.89]I mean, dude.
[169:13.61]What are you doing?
[169:14.09]What are you doing?
[169:15.31]I'm fine.
[169:15.87]I have an escape pod right there.
[169:31.29]Before you raid Conrad, can you just get a DMCA strike?
[169:34.29]No.
[169:35.77]What is... Stop.
[169:36.37]Stop it.
[169:41.11]Alright.
[169:42.42]I think they're about to start.
[169:47.68]Is the countdown still there?
[169:48.48]Let me check.
[169:51.48]10 minutes?
[169:51.84]5 minutes?
[169:52.04]Is there enough to do one restaurant evening?
[170:00.62]Six minutes?
[170:01.24]Uh, let's, let's, yeah, let's get you over there.
[170:02.74]I don't want to be late.
[170:10.42]You need to, one stream that deserves a sequel is a kill the meme stream.
[170:13.58]I talked about that six months ago.
[170:18.67]Alright, guys.
[170:20.39]Go say hello to Connor.
[170:23.01]A couple of Grotto Beasts related items, bundles are available for raffle and for auction.
[170:34.21]Please go support it.
[170:37.11]We'll see you again.
[170:37.75]Let me just get this set up.
[170:42.89]Yeah, everything supports the Immune Deficiency Foundation.
[170:46.26]So... Go hang out.
[170:51.82]I'm very curious how some of these items do.
[170:54.56]Especially the auction ones.
[170:59.16]I'll see you guys on Monday.
[171:00.67]House Flipper competition with a bunch of streamers.
[171:04.67]Should be a good time.
[171:06.55]I'll be in offline chat probably on Sunday night.

[171:50.75]I'm very curious what happens to these items.
[171:59.02]See you Monday.
[172:04.14]This music is fine for the outro here.
[172:10.20]In the event that everything gets cut off.
[172:14.76]Calling mother.
[172:16.47]Call your father too.
[172:25.42]This is nice, isn't it?
[172:26.42]Yeah.
[172:27.14]That was nice.
[172:29.82]See you later, bro.
[172:30.54]Drink some water.
[172:31.18]That goes for you too.
[172:38.96]Yeah, sorry I've been a little messed up the last week, but it's okay.
[172:46.06]I'll be good by Monday.
[172:49.35]And don't trust me, I'm fine.
[172:51.11]It's just some minor annoyances.
[172:56.41]I'm good.
[173:00.85]See you later.
[173:04.94]Goodbye.
[173:08.49]Yeah, it's stomach related if you're curious.
[173:10.70]I'm good.
