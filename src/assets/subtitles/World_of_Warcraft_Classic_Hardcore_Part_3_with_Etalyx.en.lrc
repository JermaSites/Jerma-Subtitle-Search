[ve:61.1.100]

[00:40.57]What's happening?
[00:41.13]Currently enjoying the World of Warcraft game.
[00:51.50]I do have really good news.
[01:00.08]For those of you.
[01:00.62]That really, really want to see Nancy Drew.
[01:05.60]Great news.
[01:06.12]The Nancy Drew stream.
[01:11.53]is going to be confirmed on the calendar.
[01:16.83]Can you hear my smile?
[01:18.41]Hey, here's a tip.
[01:21.18]If you want somebody on the other end of the phone, you can hear a smile.
[01:26.20]I'm smiling right now.
[01:28.34]If you're talking to somebody and you want them to know that you're happy, smile while you talk.
[01:34.21]It makes you sound so much more inviting.
[01:36.85]It's a little tip for you.
[01:41.44]Anyways.
[01:42.82]The Nancy Drew stream is going to be.
[01:46.28]Probably very shortly, maybe the day before the day after.
[01:51.42]The.
[01:53.44]Monster Hunter Wilds.
[01:55.50]Stream.
[01:57.52]I don't know how into Monster Hunter Wilds I'm going to get.
[01:59.34]Seems like it's going to be pretty fun.
[02:03.17]A lot of people want to play it.
[02:06.61]I know the the four horsemen.
[02:10.07]The apocalypse.
[02:14.84]I know Etalyx has talked about playing it.
[02:16.56]So there's plenty of opportunity to play it, but on launch day, I'll be playing it.
[02:26.99]After today's stream, you probably won't see me for a while until then.
[02:35.98]So I'm going to say that you'll get the Nancy Drew, maybe some more Warcraft.
[02:45.01]27th.
[02:47.39]And then Monster Hunter Wilds on launch day.
[02:50.52]Sound like a plan?
[02:57.36]You need to stream every day.
[02:58.78]Don't be a coward.
[03:01.95]That's not... I never did day... I wasn't a daily streamer anyways.
[03:08.84]Even when I was really, you want to put it in quotes, full time on Twitch.
[03:13.83]I was only doing three, four, five days a week.
[03:16.79]Sometimes three, four, four and a half, five days.
[03:21.59]I think I was averaging 15 to 20 streams a month.
[03:28.08]Rather than the four or the three or four that we're doing now.
[03:35.40]2019 was your busiest year.
[03:43.62]I can imagine, yeah.
[03:45.18]I went all in from 2018 to 2022.
[03:48.26]But no, I'm having fun.
[03:57.76]It's been going well.
[03:58.61]I think I've been having a good time.
[04:02.37]Well, I don't think I've been having... I know I've been having a good time, because why would I be here three days in a row?
[04:06.07]That's all there is to it.
[04:13.35]Yeah, we're going to do Ragefire Chasm.
[04:17.41]I don't know.
[04:18.13]We're 15.
[04:21.67]I wonder if I should hit 16 before doing Ragefire.
[04:26.63]We could just say who cares and just go for it.
[04:30.22]I got tea right now.
[04:31.14]People asking about if I had tea today.
[04:32.46]I've got one right now.
[04:38.42]15 is the sweet spot.
[04:40.44]OK.
[04:48.16]It is a peppermint tea.
[04:52.06]I told you I was obsessed with this stuff.
[04:55.32]You thought I was messing around.
[04:56.42]I drank this every day.
[05:05.65]Walmart Jim Carrey.
[05:06.85]I love you.
[05:07.89]Don't put us in the same category ever again.
[05:12.35]Jim Carrey is four or five tiers above.
[05:13.93]How could you compare us?
[05:16.57]How dare you?
[05:22.83]Alright, let's get the pre-rolls knocked out.
[05:27.65]I'm going to grab something.
[05:30.63]I want to sit on something a little.
[05:31.89]My back needs to be propped up a little better.
[05:33.49]I'll see you in a few minutes.
[05:35.98]Let's get rid of the pre-rolls.
[05:36.74]See you in three minutes.
[05:42.58]Oh, smoking pre-rolls?
[05:46.19]No.
[05:47.31]No, not today.
[05:48.07]Not today.
[05:50.31]I'll be back.
[08:58.99]OK, I just just chiming back in.
[09:02.03]Somebody said that all you watching ads right now missed it.
[09:04.91]He ripped his shirt off and he's showing us his chest tattoos.
[09:18.18]Alright, how are you doing?
[09:20.82]Good to see you.
[09:23.79]Free rolls should be off for an hour.
[09:26.25]Good.
[09:27.81]Let's fucking go.
[09:37.49]Okay, so last thing we did to Alex and I were questing.
[09:40.59]We made it to Ratchet.
[09:42.94]We were going to do Ragefire.
[09:44.36]I want to do some tailoring stuff though.
[09:48.50]Because, let me see.
[09:53.77]I currently have the tuxedo on, which is plus 10% swag.
[10:04.11]Alright, I need course three.
[10:05.17]Is there a tailor here?
[10:07.17]I think they're going to Crossroads.
[10:09.01]I'm going to go to Crossroads.
[10:13.59]I can't keep up with the VODs.
[10:19.47]Well, that's the thing.
[10:20.13]When it's a bunch of gaming streams in a row, it's just kind of a stream, right?
[10:31.03]Alright, back to the Crossroads.
[10:31.93]Let's go.
[10:41.32]These wild streams are so... You swore, but I'm going to remove it.
[10:46.44]These wild streams are very chill.
[10:49.56]Good.
[10:50.72]That's the point.
[10:51.54]The point with these gaming streams is to kind of let them sit.
[10:57.58]WoW is a great background game.
[11:00.92]Just kind of chill and talk and just hang out.
[11:06.20]The energy levels can be brought down, which I like that.
[11:11.20]Everything doesn't have to be 10,000 miles per hour, right?
[11:22.90]Family Guy mobile stream.
[11:24.18]I don't even know if that game is downloadable anymore.
[11:30.36]Maybe it is.
[11:31.02]I don't know.
[11:38.46]I didn't play Kiss from a Rose yet.
[11:42.97]But we'll play that in the dungeon.
[11:44.29]No, actually, I don't want to play that in the dungeon because that will just ruin the VOD and a lot of people want to see the dungeon with audio.
[11:53.34]Alright, there's a tailor here, yeah.
[11:57.91]Oh, uh... Uh... I got linked.
[12:01.69]VR Josh linked me this thing.
[12:03.99]I can separate the audio tracks.
[12:06.52]I gotta get that set up.
[12:07.96]Because then I can play music and don't have to worry about it kind of nuking the VOD.
[12:12.04]It's a way to separate the channels.
[12:18.39]Alright, how many of these do I need?
[12:24.81]Let's get 10 of these.
[12:27.13]I'm just trying to scale up.
[12:27.91]That's all I'm trying to do.
[12:38.05]They'll hear you humming to nothing on the VOD.
[12:41.63]I feel like I do that anyways.
[12:46.88]When you have this stream on, it's like having a bird in your house.
[12:53.54]Those of you that own birds,
[12:57.07]Every so often, the bird just kind of goes... I do that.
[13:15.30]I'm like having a bird in your house.
[13:18.09]So if you want to know what it's like, if you hate this stream, if you think this stream sucks and you're like, man, I can't stand this stream, don't get a bird.
[13:36.75]Uh, I can probably learn some new stuff.
[13:41.66]I just looked at how much money I had.
[13:42.72]I was like, oh, I forgot.
[13:43.64]I just, I won all those death rolls yesterday.
[13:46.92]I am rich.
[13:48.30]I've got two gold at level 15.
[13:50.40]That's insane.
[13:52.50]Alright.
[13:52.76]I need to preserve my wealth.
[13:58.83]I'm going to make one linen bag.
[14:06.05]I can always sell these too.
[14:09.65]So what if we do like the stream a lot?
[14:11.24]Should we get a bird?
[14:12.06]Uh, no, you also shouldn't get a bird.
[14:20.78]Birds, bird, well, here's the thing.
[14:22.36]If you really want a bird, do a lot of research.
[14:30.77]Some birds need a lot of care.
[14:31.91]They need a lot of very specific enclosures.
[14:35.65]A bird is not like getting a golden retriever.
[14:38.56]You know, golden retrievers work.
[14:44.24]But with a golden retriever, you know, you can kind of like open the back door and if you have a backyard, they kind of just run around in a circle for 10 minutes and you let them back in.
[14:56.25]What if I like birds?
[14:59.87]Yeah, just make sure you do some research and figure out if it's what you really want to do.
[15:05.99]Do some research.
[15:09.83]Some birds will live longer than you will.
[15:11.63]That's true.
[15:12.19]There needs to be a plan for that.
[15:16.39]What about Overwatch 2?
[15:18.31]No, I don't think I'll ever play that game.
[15:20.30]Are these better than what I have?
[15:24.24]No.
[15:24.34]How is this not better than what I have on?
[15:28.22]There we go.
[15:47.62]Well, it took me nine clicks to do it.
[15:50.06]I just wanted to put the gloves on.
[15:52.46]And I think I did that at the most possible clicks to do that.
[15:57.45]I just wanted to equip the gloves.
[15:59.23]But I didn't want to sell them and then I would have sold them or whatever.
[16:11.42]Oh, these are all sixes, right?
[16:12.62]Okay.
[16:12.80]Okay.
[16:23.59]You ever stop talking, bro?
[16:26.50]Don't get a bird.
[16:49.49]Alright.
[16:53.96]66 out of 70.
[16:54.72]I can get the next tailoring, right?
[17:03.72]I need an expert tailor.
[17:04.84]I think I have to go to a major city to do that.
[17:07.52]Yeah, okay.
[17:24.21]You gonna play with someone today?
[17:25.11]I think yeah, Etalyx and I are going to do Ragefire.
[17:30.83]And I don't know what the pla- I don't know if we might try to grab a few random people or maybe if some of the Onlyfangs people are.
[17:38.95]I know that there's a couple of raids I think going on right now.
[17:45.23]But we'll see.
[17:52.31]Oh, I can do this now.
[17:53.13]Yeah.
[17:54.55]Yeah.
[17:54.81]Alright.
[17:55.09]Let me get this out of the way now.
[17:57.63]So this quest, this is a, this is a fun one.
[18:00.24]This is another walk on the road for 20 minutes quest, but you get a lot of good shit and I get a new staff and I get a ton of these potions.
[18:07.72]This is actually one of the most important items in the whole game in hardcore.
[18:13.37]So it is always recommended that you have at least one or two of these.
[18:19.98]So this is worth going again.
[18:20.96]I'm going to go do it right now.
[18:22.24]The reason why it's kind of annoying, you have to do it in 45 minutes.
[18:26.60]And if you just choose to leave immediately, like I'm going to do right now, it won't take you that long, but let's just go.
[18:43.11]People died doing this auto walking.
[18:45.15]I know.
[18:46.25]Especially when you get down here.
[18:47.33]Because Mulgore is this way.
[18:53.31]Where's the alliance patrol?
[18:54.45]Did they come up here?
[18:55.77]They're only down here, right?
[18:58.07]Scariest shit ever.
[19:05.43]We still going to do command and conquer?
[19:06.57]Absolutely.
[19:09.83]I think the hierarchy here is we're going to do Monster Hunter wilds.
[19:15.42]And then whatever, if we want to do, you know, some RTS stuff, we'll do it.
[19:26.64]I love how he hops around.
[19:27.56]Yeah, Imp is the coolest pet, but it's unfortunately not the most effective.
[19:36.83]Succubus is better, I think, in a lot of ways.
[19:38.89]Uh, Fel Hunter, Voidwalker.
[19:42.07]I mean, Imp is good for the best, right?
[19:51.76]Fel Hunter is my, probably the second favorite.
[20:09.28]What does this max out at, at level 60?
[20:13.90]20?
[20:13.92]30?
[20:16.25]Is Blood Pact really good at max level?
[20:32.44]Yes.
[20:38.77]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[20:39.77]Ragefire is going to be so... Oh, God.
[20:41.95]What happened here?
[20:59.72]Oh, my God.
[21:00.40]Oh, my God.
[21:01.80]What do I do?
[21:02.12]Do I help?
[21:03.46]Should I help you?
[21:06.98]Did you get away?
[21:07.66]Oh my fucking god.
[21:08.56]That's so many.
[21:19.54]Thank god I moved.
[21:20.64]I was thinking about sitting there and saying like a prayer or something for that person.
[21:26.16]I would have died.
[21:27.26]I would have died right next to him.
[21:39.94]actually really funny part of me is annoyed that that didn't happen because that's what a great way to go out but then have my characters gone but you know whatever alright let's not because a lot of the stuff here I think is 18
[22:07.45]Half the stuff in the area I'm going to is about 18 to 20, I think.
[22:11.89]Which will obliterate me if I aggro it.
[22:21.61]17, yeah.
[22:23.45]17.
[22:23.81]Do not aggro.
[22:24.47]Okay, I'm zooming out.
[22:26.71]Get myself killed on this road.
[22:28.00]Jeremy, do you think you'll stream in hell when you die?
[22:40.57]Uh... No, I... I'm... Listen.
[22:53.60]You're gonna collab with Ben Franklin?
[22:56.70]Alright.
[22:58.78]But... I mean... I mean, Ben Franklin... I could stream with the actual Four Horsemen.
[23:14.06]No.
[23:15.26]The seven heavenly virtues.
[23:17.90]I want to stream with temperance, chastity, charity, diligence.
[23:27.45]Charity.
[23:29.53]Humility.
[23:32.73]I think I got them all.
[23:33.73]I think I actually got them all this time.
[23:43.38]Please stop with the virtues.
[23:45.90]Why would you rather me just talk about sins every day?
[23:51.88]The seven virtues don't get a bunch of TV shows.
[23:54.86]The seven virtues don't get the cool tattoos.
[24:00.16]What's up with that?
[24:18.95]Loser.
[24:19.71]Religious.
[24:28.14]Now, don't you think... I kind of want to see a depiction of the seven heavenly virtues.
[24:33.72]You know what?
[24:34.04]The only place you hear about the seven heavenly virtues is when you look up the Wikipedia article about it.
[24:40.76]I'd love to see a Seven Heavenly Virtues represented as, you know, like, powerful, um, beings in a show or a video game or- we- we only- the Seven Sins is so- it's so outdated.
[24:50.28]We get- we- so tired.
[24:52.20]We've seen it too many times.
[24:54.22]Oh, look, it's greed.
[24:55.02]It's greed here.
[24:55.52]Look, lust, lust.
[24:56.48]Oh, lust, lust.
[24:57.78]I want temperance to show up and cast a fucking spell out of his hand, like, blue- like, blue positive energy at something.
[25:07.07]Well met.
[25:09.95]Goodbye.
[25:18.63]Bro wants the Care Bears back.
[25:26.86]The Care Bears were... That's the last depiction we had of the Seven Heavenly Virtues.
[25:31.42]The Care Bears were the Seven Heavenly Virtues.
[25:34.30]What's going on here?
[25:35.06]Is this the only place they've ever shown up?
[25:37.32]And everybody loved that show.
[25:38.32]That's a classic television show.
[25:52.71]We got the Care Bears and then we got... Oh, I want more Care Bears shooting fucking rainbows out of their stomach.
[26:15.22]I mean, they can still kill people.
[26:16.48]That's fine.
[26:19.12]But do it in a, in a very, you know, prudent, good.
[26:24.00]I don't think that's good.
[26:36.79]What am I doing?
[26:37.31]I have to, I only have 30 minutes to get there.
[26:40.49]I got the flight path though.
[26:41.61]That's good.
[26:43.96]You sound like a youth pastor.
[26:58.32]Dude, pride just knocked out the greed Care Bear.
[27:04.26]Why do I feel like the Care Bears were the Seven Heavenly Virtues and then the adult version of the Care Bears, if it's ever rebooted and they make it rated R reboot or whatever, they would be the Seven Deadly Sins.
[27:15.28]That sounds like a Robot Chicken episode.
[27:31.57]Yeah, well, whatever.
[27:42.90]That's Ted.
[27:49.82]Gummy bears?
[27:51.26]Oh, the grumpy bears.
[27:52.54]I remember the gummy bears.
[27:55.83]There were a lot of bear-based television shows back in the 90s, weren't there?
[28:03.21]There's the Berenstain Bears, the Care Bears, the Gummy Bears.
[28:12.35]We kind of lost the bear themed television shows, didn't we?
[28:22.10]What the fuck is a gummy bear?
[28:25.10]You know what a gummy bear is, come on.
[28:39.43]Holy shit, this person... No, you keep doing this!
[28:41.53]You keep tricking me!
[28:42.33]Alright, I'm almost there.
[29:01.32]34 minutes.
[29:01.58]I actually... I probably would like starting as a tauren.
[29:09.45]This zone is really just peaceful.
[29:12.89]I don't think anything is that particularly dangerous in Mulgore either.
[29:16.29]I feel like starting a tauren is the chill way to start the game.
[29:19.24]The goal is up here.
[29:34.18]We're going that way.
[29:37.08]There's nothing here that will kill me.
[29:38.59]I'll just get the shortest mileage there.
[29:41.47]These things are level 9, right?
[30:07.82]Elevators and TB.
[30:08.64]Yeah, as long as you're careful, though.
[30:09.58]You have Force Strength, Force Stamina, anything equipped?
[30:25.50]Uh, I'm about to.
[30:26.08]I'm about to get that.
[30:35.13]I had a bagel sandwich.
[30:40.05]Sausage, egg, and cheese.
[30:41.47]It was good.
[30:58.86]Aw, dude.
[30:59.58]Aw, dude.
[31:00.42]Aw, dude.
[31:03.80]Leather belt, leather belt, leather... Watch out.
[31:06.44]This is a level 9.
[31:08.96]Don't aggro, please.
[31:09.80]I might be dead here.
[31:31.18]Help me!
[31:33.71]With pleasure.
[31:34.41]I look really small.
[31:57.28]That's where we're going.
[31:58.08]Do RFC in first person.
[32:04.86]guaranteed death you may as well just say hey dude just screw this whole group just kill everybody in the group and make a funny joke for us that's what you're asking me to do that's the thing about hardcore is when you're playing hardcore on like the regular mode
[32:26.40]If you wipe in a dungeon on the regular mode, just because somebody backed up and pulled five enemies and killed everybody, people might leave and go, hey, dude, that was stupid.
[32:36.87]But when you do that in hardcore, you delete other people's characters.
[32:44.91]It is so nerve-wracking.
[32:47.37]That's why I'm going to be such a... Like, if anyone tells me to jump, I'm going to say, how high?
[32:56.49]I'm not... I'm not doing... I'm not moving.
[32:57.99]I'm not touching anything.
[32:58.87]I'm not doing anything.
[33:00.43]I'm just gonna pump as hard as I can.
[33:05.71]And make sure I don't pull threat.
[33:06.67]That's all I'm gonna do.
[33:07.37]I'm not... I'm gonna follow whoever tells me whatever they're gonna do.
[33:19.25]Oh, hello.
[33:21.79]Alright, careful here.
[33:22.37]This is where people die.
[33:32.63]Alright, this is where you can tell if I'm done with WoW.
[33:35.10]If I'm not having that, if I'm kind of done with the game, this is the point where you'll know.
[33:41.62]Because I will walk off and know and die.
[33:43.82]And then, okay, well, I guess I'll move on.
[33:46.46]If I don't do that, then I'm still having fun.
[33:54.58]I almost just did it.
[33:55.66]And I actually like the game.
[34:13.27]Where is this?
[34:15.37]Level 11?
[34:15.67]Is that here?
[34:18.31]Oh, yeah.
[34:20.15]I don't want to do that.
[34:23.70]I just want the flight path.
[34:30.56]Flight path and the tailor.
[34:31.62]And then I'm good.
[34:43.49]Live by the bit and die by the bit.
[34:45.23]That's right.
[34:52.09]Grubby said he would coach you Warcraft 3 if you want since you watched his Tyler content.
[34:57.98]Oh, man.
[34:58.46]I have such bad retention problems, though.
[35:03.88]He would teach me how to do stuff.
[35:06.79]And I would all be gone in an hour.
[35:12.09]I'd still be building half-done gold mines and putting one unfinished farm somewhere in the corner of the map to be an asshole.
[35:22.34]That was Warcraft 2, right?
[35:26.60]Be careful.
[35:28.65]Yeah, if I fail in Warcraft 3, I definitely appreciate the offer.
[35:32.45]Grubby's definitely the one I would want to be coached by for sure.
[35:44.64]Oh, I have a timed quest.
[35:47.88]Where is it?
[35:48.24]How come it's not on the screen?
[35:56.04]Oh, I got 20.
[35:56.60]Guys, I could sit here and watch a whole episode of Family Guy and be fine.
[36:04.63]There it is, okay.
[36:11.97]One thing about Thunder Bluff that is always confusing is it's kind of multi-layered.
[36:15.35]So some stuff looks like it's close, but it's not.
[36:26.20]I think it's down here.
[36:29.97]Where?
[36:30.21]Oh, is it in this building?
[36:37.85]Big, big tailoring moves coming up here.
[36:40.16]Nice.
[36:45.42]Alright.
[36:46.26]So now I have a max of up to 150.
[36:54.27]So I just gotta get a bunch more linen cloth.
[37:01.03]Have I used the auction house yet?
[37:03.99]Every single second of this character has been streamed.
[37:06.76]I haven't used the auction house, right?
[37:08.34]Did I buy anything off the auction house?
[37:10.80]I don't think so, right?
[37:16.50]You did?
[37:17.86]I bought a bag?
[37:19.44]You window shopped.
[37:20.48]You bought bags.
[37:21.34]Oh, I bought bags?
[37:23.68]Oh, fuck.
[37:24.40]I bought bags.
[37:25.42]I bought these... Well, I can make them.
[37:27.37]Okay, what if I... What if I make them and then delete these?
[37:32.87]Ah, shit.
[37:33.47]I did buy... Okay, but here's the thing.
[37:36.93]These are the equivalent of the bag that's in the front seat in front of you on an airplane to puke into.
[37:43.73]Right?
[37:43.99]Like this... I could just... It's alright, right?
[37:46.49]Is it okay?
[38:04.14]It was a gift to you in the mail?
[38:07.14]You can't unpuke in those bags.
[38:09.73]Yeah, that's why I'm saying I could just throw them away.
[38:11.77]I could just delete them.
[38:15.29]And then I can make these anyways now, so I can just make them.
[38:18.89]Alright.
[38:20.10]Uh, I need to turn that thing in.
[38:31.49]Just imagine that, yeah, imagine that two or three of these have already been puked in.
[38:36.23]This is the only one that isn't like soggy and, okay, that people are probably eating.
[38:41.86]I know that because it's lunchtime and I just was.
[38:43.77]So, apologize about that.
[38:58.50]Oh, that's right.
[38:59.06]You can die on these too.
[39:00.28]You got to be so careful because there's a spot right here on each one of these bridge lips.
[39:08.44]I think you can actually sometimes you can fall through.
[39:11.30]Oh, is that an urban legend?
[39:16.94]I feel like there are some myths that people think are true that might not be real.
[39:30.26]Show us.
[39:31.30]Well, okay.
[39:31.74]Ready?
[39:33.18]Right there.
[39:34.70]There's something weird with that lip where you can get caught on it.
[39:50.21]This is a silver pine, I believe.
[39:53.17]Yeah.
[39:54.43]I think we're skipping silver pine entirely.
[40:04.34]Alright, give me this good stuff.
[40:07.10]This is good to have before this dungeon too.
[40:12.01]What's that?
[40:19.49]Oh, there are other people doing the quest.
[40:20.73]Okay.
[40:24.75]Definitely picking the swiftness potion.
[40:26.44]There's only 800 experience to run all the way here.
[40:34.61]Join what?
[40:38.07]Those are good.
[40:39.10]Serpent bloom is whaling caverns though.
[40:40.56]We're not doing that yet.
[40:46.42]What's my first aid at?
[40:48.89]Yeah, we're good.
[40:58.35]Alright, I think... I think I'm... I think I'm ready.
[41:04.57]Don't do that here.
[41:06.45]I'm a jumping Andy.
[41:07.39]This is the worst place to do that.
[41:13.68]Do I have all my spell ranks?
[41:15.08]I guess I could check that too.
[41:18.60]Where's the... Oh, that's right.
[41:21.15]There is no Warlock Trainer in Thunder Bluff.
[41:23.91]They don't believe in it or something, right?
[41:29.10]you are playing with matches don't whoa what are you thinking yeah they don't believe in it
[41:57.90]No dark magic allowed in my nature sanctuary.
[42:01.84]What about shadow priest?
[42:04.72]There's a priest trainer here, right?
[42:07.20]So the priest trainer is allowed to teach dark magic, but the dark magic expert is not allowed in Thunder Bluff.
[42:19.14]There's no priest trainer either.
[42:24.16]Oh shit.
[42:32.35]Is there a?
[42:33.03]OK.
[42:34.81]In TBC in Wrath, is there a Paladin trainer in Thunder Bluff or no?
[42:38.48]That's still the light.
[42:39.54]It's still kind of like religion.
[42:42.84]Or it's not really related.
[42:44.50]It's like the Nauru, right?
[42:50.10]No, start it.
[42:50.66]That's not until Cataclysm.
[42:57.49]Alright, I think I'm ready to get a. What is the level range?
[43:01.29]Are we going to be good?
[43:06.71]13 to 18, I think we'll be alright.
[43:10.15]If Etalyx wants to get one more level to be, because I think Etalyx is tanking it.
[43:14.99]So... We'll go by what Etalyx feels comfortable with, because tanking at 15 or 16, I think that's a pretty big difference, especially because you get new abilities.
[43:32.08]15 is fine for it.
[43:32.82]Okay.
[43:36.37]Well, let's say let's let's give it Alex call.
[43:51.79]Hello, hello.
[43:56.27]Hello again, everyone.
[43:58.63]Good morning.
[43:59.67]Good morning.
[44:01.23]Good afternoon.
[44:05.21]So how do you feel about tanking at 15?
[44:09.10]People said it's fine.
[44:10.08]People said you'll be alright.
[44:11.68]But we're going to go by how you feel.
[44:14.38]Do you want to get to 16 before we do this?
[44:16.28]How do you feel?
[44:18.80]I mean, if you want to go, I'm good to go.
[44:21.04]But I also only have like seven bars to the next level.
[44:27.10]Like 65%, 60% of the way there.
[44:28.68]Okay.
[44:34.38]Uh, yeah, let's... Let's get you to 16.
[44:36.96]I feel like 15 is a... Having those new ranks on some of those moves would probably be way more threat.
[44:50.25]So, let's definitely do 16.
[44:52.55]I can be 15, because I'm just a coward, you know, dark magic user that sits behind everybody.
[44:57.20]But you, you gotta be up in there, so...
[44:59.95]yeah probably like I'd be fine doing it at 15 I think the only thing that um is a small concern is I don't have like full two-handed sword skill yet but I'm uh I uh did a little training arc off stream last night and I'm at like 64 out of 75 cool so you want to head back to uh bear I I did the thunder bluff run you know just get out of the way
[45:28.84]Yeah, I just flew over because I already had the flight path.
[45:32.37]Yeah, we could do the raptors.
[45:34.69]Get these dried seeds.
[45:37.97]We could go back down to Northwatch to get these telescopes and boots.
[45:49.32]I'll fly to Ratchet.
[45:56.48]I am on my way to Ratchet.
[46:00.71]When are they going to open up a casino in Azeroth?
[46:05.53]Well, that wouldn't be in Thunder Bluff.
[46:10.20]You can't train warlock, can't train priest, can't gamble.
[46:14.30]I feel like the goblins would do it for sure.
[46:20.54]I'm surprised.
[46:21.12]There actually might be something in the goblin capital city that's goofy like that, I wonder.
[46:44.63]Trevor, why did you design your character to look like you?
[46:48.14]Guys, all undead characters look like me, okay?
[46:51.06]I've come to terms with that.
[46:52.98]I've got the, like, the sunken cheeks, the pie cheekbones, the bald head, the eyes, the chin.
[46:59.44]That's fine.
[46:59.88]I think he's handsome.
[47:11.47]I like how you started the stream today like um going and doing the quest to get swiftness potions and you're like okay now I'm ready for rfc hey Etalyx you ready to uh you ready to tank I got my swiftness potions they're really gonna help in the dungeon what you mean you mean I said are you ready and then did a 45 minute quest oh I I had to go get it too but I was just uh doing some fishing
[47:40.14]but I meant like you were getting you're getting ready to like you're getting ready to run oh I yeah I'm ready to run I am ready to here's my plan okay my voidwalker I know don't use the voidwalker and you can turn off the taunting so it would actually wouldn't be pulling aggro from anything but the plan is in any bad scenario is have the voidwalker just tab target attack that tab target attack that tab target attack that and then run
[48:09.21]Because the Voidwalker will get aggro from enemies that were not attacked yet.
[48:14.51]So then everybody can just get away.
[48:16.09]Well, I mean, I'll be doing like an AoE shout that builds threat on everybody in an area.
[48:22.76]So it would be real hard to pull all of them off me, I think.
[48:28.34]Well, if you jumped into the lava, they would probably all run to you.
[48:32.19]And then we could all get out.
[48:34.10]yeah if I if I just dive in the lava yeah I would just have to die first I have to hit the self-destruct button or the ejector seat and then then you could do that yeah now I'm I'm not I am not roaching I'm planting my feet solely into the ground and I'm going to just pump I'm going to put dots on everybody I'm going to fear people um if it gets crazy
[48:59.15]You will see.
[49:00.15]The flight or fight response will come out in a dungeon.
[49:03.09]In the open world, I am going to flight every time.
[49:07.73]In a dungeon?
[49:08.97]No.
[49:09.73]No, there's nowhere to go.
[49:11.87]There's an infinite aggro range in dungeons.
[49:14.67]You have to fight.
[49:17.29]If you pull like 15 people, yeah, okay, the whole dungeon is chasing us.
[49:20.76]We gotta go.
[49:25.60]Outside in the open world, you get a chance to get away.
[49:28.96]In a dungeon, you are fucked.
[49:30.34]You have to stay.
[49:31.02]You have to fight.
[49:39.43]You guys are planning RFC like it's Naxxramas.
[49:45.73]rfc is very easy but if okay Etalyx you can chime in on this too if you don't take this seriously then why didn't you take it seriously when we all died do you know what I mean like just because things are easy doesn't mean people aren't stupid
[50:08.80]Like, you gotta take it seriously.
[50:11.24]Because then if everybody dies, then the fingers start to point of, hey, dude, why didn't you take that seriously?
[50:24.94]You want to invite?
[50:26.48]Oh, yeah.
[50:27.06]Sorry, sir.
[50:34.44]It may be easy, but people do die there.
[50:39.20]Oh shit, these are good.
[50:42.49]Those are amazing.
[50:43.23]I have to take my underwear off for them though.
[50:50.45]Alright, just sell the underwear.
[50:53.29]Sell.
[50:55.12]Is the streamer selling his underwear on stream?
[51:07.74]through proxy actually that is kind of weird isn't it though so right now I went up to a vendor and I just took my pants off and sold it to him it's aggressive but I feel like the goblins might respect that I thought this guy was just hitting the fucking goblin in the head with a wrench
[51:40.97]What is he doing?
[51:41.71]There's nothing even here.
[51:43.19]Have a good one.
[51:48.91]OK, Ella.
[51:57.68]I just looked at the the death logs.
[51:59.64]I think this is only counting everyone else who has the death log add on.
[52:04.30]So this is there are more than 1000 people who have died in RFC.
[52:11.29]that's a lot there's a lot of people alright well I think we have all the quests for it I don't think there's anything else right is there yeah let's just go do the uh did we come down here to do the shipment stolen stolen booty
[52:38.46]uh yeah we'll go down there and do that that by that you might hit um you're actually selling pants and stealing booty uh it's up that way okay to get my pet and we can go you don't have to do rfc to be safe yeah but that's you know it's sometimes it's fun to get the adrenaline rush of we actually all might die in here
[53:13.55]Oh, did you pick up the rest of these quests?
[53:17.39]Uh, this spider eggs one I didn't get because it says level 20.
[53:20.42]I just figured that might be dangerous.
[53:40.72]I'll save this for the dungeon.
[53:49.54]Yeah, big reason to do the dungeons is because they drop the best stuff.
[53:53.94]Ragefire is kind of a tutorial dungeon in a way.
[53:58.02]Wailing Caverns is the first, I would say, real dungeon that drops blues.
[54:02.84]That's 18 to 25-ish.
[54:24.45]What would you say your limit is for what dungeon scares you the most going forward?
[54:33.88]That's a tough one.
[54:34.94]I think I remember dying the most in Scarlet Monastery when I was playing an actual vanilla because I think early on I didn't realize you needed to be like different levels for different wings.
[54:45.25]So we would go into like the wrong wing.
[54:48.28]Yeah, the cathedral is terrifying.
[54:51.91]The armory is terrifying.
[54:52.99]I'd say anything from Gnomeregan to Moradon.
[54:56.79]I would just skip Moradon.
[54:58.10]I wouldn't even do it, I don't think.
[54:59.74]Yeah, Mora was terrifying.
[55:01.16]It was horrible.
[55:05.22]Zulfurak?
[55:05.81]Yeah, Zulfurak was awful too.
[55:22.15]Why does the imp sometimes beg you to let him go?
[55:24.45]I thought he was your friend.
[55:26.57]Uh, sad to say you are incorrect.
[55:30.02]Uh, all of the demons that I summon do not want to be here.
[55:34.40]They are compelled to, they are, I am, I am subjugating them.
[55:40.82]Uh, they, they don't want to be here.
[55:43.92]Some of them, I think maybe might like, don't care.
[55:45.68]Is that a, so just like chat, who is
[55:49.68]I thought that was a rare spawn.
[55:50.78]That's a named random person.
[56:01.11]And I think when they die, they go back to the hell or whatever.
[56:06.80]I don't know.
[56:07.14]The nether world or whatever it is.
[56:16.91]The twisting nether.
[56:17.67]Yeah, there it is.
[56:19.51]Not the nether like Minecraft.
[56:26.51]Um... No.
[56:32.81]I don't think I've even seen... I've collected a diamond, said, holy shit, diamonds, and then that's my I beat the game.
[56:40.10]And that's kind of where I start to not really play anymore.
[56:43.00]Ooh, I just take it.
[56:46.37]Roll, baby.
[56:47.17]You got a 90.
[56:48.25]Yeah, but you got to roll.
[56:50.11]What if you get 100?
[56:50.57]I had to know.
[56:53.93]Look, I've got to do like 10 to 100 wins to try to make up for yesterday.
[57:00.32]I still can't believe that.
[57:02.76]That was crazy.
[57:09.00]There's a... I left you a bolt of claw.
[57:11.51]You're welcome.
[57:12.53]Ooh.
[57:12.65]Ooh.
[57:28.95]What's your mining at now?
[57:29.77]Are you high in mining?
[57:32.31]I'm about to hit 60, I guess.
[57:34.43]Seems pretty low.
[57:42.56]Should be able to get 10 soon, I think.
[57:47.76]Eventually be able to make something useful with engineering.
[57:50.02]Right now, the best I can do is give you some copper bombs.
[57:56.05]Those are very good, right?
[57:59.22]It's like 28 fire damage and a one second stun.
[58:04.89]Ooh.
[58:06.67]Somebody asked, uh, you've been doing this for two days.
[58:08.45]Are you going to stop doing this?
[58:09.67]Maybe like the next six to seven months.
[58:12.45]Straight.
[58:14.68]So, uh, don't get a bird.
[58:17.82]Right?
[58:18.12]Or something.
[58:18.92]Whatever.
[58:19.68]Something like that.
[58:29.31]Okay, here's one thing.
[58:35.05]Where is it?
[58:36.83]Oh, it's right here.
[58:37.29]Is it one at a time?
[58:41.39]Okay.
[58:53.94]And then who's got the boots?
[58:55.28]It's like a dude.
[58:56.84]I think they're over here.
[59:00.12]in this other camp.
[59:06.60]Might need to invite this third party.
[59:08.61]I don't think we have to kill.
[59:16.37]I think it's just sitting here, but if we kill him though.
[59:20.14]This third party.
[59:20.92]I think one of the bosses is recognizable.
[59:35.97]Little of 19.
[59:36.49]They should be fine.
[59:51.06]Will I survive the stream today?
[59:52.34]Oh, there's a bet going on.
[60:00.16]No, we'll see.
[60:07.12]I feel like we've gotten out of some pretty goofy problems already, so hopefully our luck has not run out.
[60:15.20]We'll see how the goofy problems go when we're in control, like in the driver's seat.
[60:19.23]I feel like some of the goofy problems have been solved by simply having five people when we were only supposed to have like two or three.
[60:26.69]True.
[60:30.43]The box is over here if you haven't gotten it.
[60:34.86]That's it for that one.
[60:37.62]we could try to get around the corner we'd go right back to ratchet and then up this is such a weird quest chain you come all the way down here you do three different things you come back you turn those all in and then they want you to come back to do to pick up another thing on the ground I think we have to come back again too
[61:07.16]That's usually how it goes in World of Warcraft.
[61:09.44]Go here, come back.
[61:11.30]Now, wait, go back.
[61:13.36]Now go further.
[61:17.28]And here's your 250 XP.
[61:22.28]Also, you can kick this salmon roll, bastard.
[61:25.24]I'm just kidding.
[61:25.78]It's someone from my chat guild.
[61:30.95]Oh, it's somebody from your guild.
[61:32.03]It's not mine.
[61:32.41]Oh.
[61:38.84]I didn't make it.
[61:40.22]Oh, okay.
[61:49.10]Oh, watch out for these buccaneers.
[61:56.33]And I can't wait to get the plus 10 fire damage ring.
[62:19.22]every kill on the merchant coast is ratchet experience oh that's interesting look what I can do now nice you're turning into a proper warrior pulling and charging and dashing I learned yesterday that there are some like all-in-one macros that people do that they do one button that does like six to eight abilities
[62:51.23]for warrior where they they just push one button to do every fight I feel like macros I like using macros but I would start to get confused as just a yeah like okay cast this then that does this then that does this and that does that my brain almost has to have the tactile of I did that move and then I did this one and I did that one otherwise I kind of lose my place what's going on
[63:17.28]Yeah, I don't feel like I'm really playing WoW unless I have all five hotbars full and every ability is hotkeyed.
[63:22.74]Yeah, I think anything that does direct damage to an enemy, I think I would want it to be a button I press.
[63:52.04]When was the last time you cleaned your keyboard?
[63:56.02]Actually, it's pretty clean.
[63:58.36]I have a little air duster things.
[64:03.59]I want to say it's been probably like a couple of weeks, maybe like a week and a half, two weeks.
[64:12.02]Do you take out like every key cap or do you just do like the little air can?
[64:16.67]No, I just air can, spray all the junk out, air can.
[64:20.59]And then just take an alcohol wipe and just, just while it's, uh, the computer's off.
[64:29.28]Keep it quick, kid.
[64:30.64]I ain't got all day.
[64:32.48]Very nice.
[64:32.98]These are good.
[64:35.40]Wish they had intellect on them, but whatever.
[64:37.33]That's a lot of experience.
[64:42.25]Yeah, that was like a whole bar, I think.
[64:52.25]Can you do the have a good one line?
[64:55.50]Have a good one.
[65:01.08]The one on that wasn't as good, but the first part was.
[65:04.20]Hey, have a good one.
[65:05.78]It's good.
[65:08.36]The one is always the hard one because the air is already out of your throat.
[65:13.41]And it's keeping that air down so you can have the like... I was just gonna write, I was just gonna write, fuck you.
[65:30.38]But that would be, I pulled back on that.
[65:41.23]Okay, something about being in WoW as an undead, I just want to be like, like, shut up, leave me the fuck alone.
[65:49.87]I'm starting, the character is starting to, I'm starting to want to get into the character.
[66:06.89]What's the crane operator quest?
[66:09.71]or the uh trouble at the docks dungeon what dungeon is it for whaling caverns I think it's whaling caverns yeah this guy wants to rps his character that's what rp is yeah
[66:36.17]Alright, where to?
[66:37.31]We could go kill a bunch of raptors, get the raptor horns.
[66:41.09]Those things are level 18, so we'd have to be careful, but it'd be a lot of experience, so we could get all that raptor stuff done.
[66:47.63]Let's go for it.
[66:48.07]Let's do it.
[66:48.79]Yeah, let's just do that.
[67:03.02]chat the only time you're not role-playing is when you're by yourself anytime you're talking to another person you're role-playing that's an interesting theory that you're you're rping when you talk to anybody because you have to put on some type of role
[67:36.21]Like, okay, when you go to work, right?
[67:38.59]Like, if you work at, like, an office, are you RPing as an office worker?
[67:44.49]Like, am I RPing as a streamer right now, right?
[67:48.24]I don't know.
[67:49.14]This is getting a little too deep.
[67:57.00]Like, off stream?
[67:59.10]I am RPing right now, because off stream, I...
[68:03.10]I mean, the odd times when I, you know, dance into the mirror and do whole monologues and Shakespeare and stuff into the mirror.
[68:09.88]That's like whatever.
[68:10.46]Everybody does that.
[68:11.70]But I kind of don't do anything else.
[68:13.48]I just kind of keep my mouth shut and just sit around and like do, you know, sometimes I write.
[68:23.97]When I'm not in like an active work mode.
[68:28.20]But then are you RPing as yourself?
[68:32.81]Whoa.
[68:37.27]I mean, sometimes, yeah.
[68:39.05]Even when you're alone sometimes, you know?
[68:40.65]Because you want to have a particular view of yourself.
[68:47.20]Alright, the raptors are all over here.
[68:48.72]Alright, you're going to have to kick Salmon Roll so we get more quest items.
[68:53.48]Sorry, Salmon.
[68:55.56]We need the double experience points.
[69:02.43]Thanks for the help with the pirates, though.
[69:11.05]Alright, level 18.
[69:11.93]So this is...
[69:14.81]And there's other shit.
[69:15.73]Okay, we might consider clearing this a little more.
[69:20.11]There's a lot of bullshit in every direction.
[69:24.63]Just pull everything.
[69:26.21]These are all red too.
[69:27.25]They're all going to aggro.
[69:28.80]This is a mess.
[69:30.36]Alright.
[69:33.12]I have no confidence that we can... Let's just kill everything here.
[69:36.18]And then we can deal with the spawns when they come out.
[69:43.08]Already resisting.
[69:59.10]There we go.
[69:59.50]That was a juicy amount of experience.
[70:01.30]Someone in chat asked if I'm a Gemini and I am deeply offended.
[70:07.38]I'm a Taurus.
[70:08.06]Thank you.
[70:11.72]Just like your character.
[70:14.14]Just like my character.
[70:25.36]I'm a uh virgo libra I think a virgo libra cusp is what it is so I'm incredibly emotional and unbearable to deal with uh but I also want everything to be balanced yeah I'm dual class yeah
[70:56.17]Virgo liberal.
[71:12.10]Virgin liberal.
[71:18.37]get this one back it up a little like like I don't actually adhere to any horoscope shit right sure I have to preface it but I've heard people say that horoscopes are designed to make you identify with whichever one you happen to be and I just don't think that's true like if I if I look at other signs I think that doesn't describe me at all but when I look at Taurus and it says Taurus is a lazy piece of shit I go yeah that's true
[71:50.89]Yeah, I... Sometimes I'll look at it and I'll say... Whoa, that's actually me.
[71:59.59]But then sometimes you'll look at it and it'll go... It'll say something completely not even close to what happened today.
[72:04.62]And you kind of go, oh, they must have just got it right.
[72:08.04]It must have been off today.
[72:09.04]Like the moon must not have been bright enough for them to get the energy from me.
[72:18.94]Yeah, walk them back a little.
[72:24.77]This one rafter, he's marching over here.
[72:33.17]Okay, cool.
[72:35.23]Let's get rid of these lions here.
[72:37.67]Let's get rid of these lions after you heal up a little.
[72:41.08]I got you.
[72:41.48]Horoscopes are OG brain rot.
[72:52.51]Okay, but here's the thing, right?
[72:55.03]Anybody in chat who says horoscopes are complete bullshit will still open their fortune cookie and read it when they get Chinese food.
[73:01.16]You know what I'm saying?
[73:01.78]So, like, there's got to be a middle ground.
[73:04.82]I think... Here's what I think.
[73:07.56]I think if it makes you happy and it helps you improve your life and it keeps you aware of the things you do, the things you aren't doing, who gives a shit?
[73:25.13]If it's used as a little... as a tool to help you feel better about maybe the world or how you're doing or... Oh, it said that today I had to be careful of my finances.
[73:34.12]Okay, that means that person's gonna... Maybe you're not gonna buy anything crazy today.
[73:38.00]It's a good way to help with, you know, just keeping track of your life and... And whatever that is.
[73:45.38]Like, who cares?
[73:46.02]Like, people have different things to... Look, we're all trying to find ways to cope with this fucked up world, okay?
[73:56.72]A meteor might hit in 10 years.
[73:59.17]Let's just try to live a little, you know?
[74:20.47]So I looked up my horoscope just now just for fun.
[74:22.69]The thing about horoscopes is they don't tell you what to do.
[74:25.61]My horoscope today is like, you're thinking of your mother.
[74:29.45]You should enhance that relationship with your mom.
[74:32.53]And it's like, okay, you know what?
[74:34.05]True.
[74:34.54]I should.
[74:36.10]Cool.
[74:36.40]Hold on.
[74:36.94]I want to do one.
[74:39.22]Read your whole one.
[74:40.26]It's usually like a paragraph, right?
[74:42.72]Yeah.
[74:43.16]It's...
[74:45.35]Your mother may be on your mind today, Taurus.
[74:47.67]Your mother probably affects how you think, act, and feel in the past and now.
[74:53.27]If your mother's sign is opposite of yours, conflict and misunderstanding could happen more easily.
[74:58.27]Take the time to learn about her today to help you understand her and the relationship you have.
[75:02.97]Interesting.
[75:09.69]So yeah, so yeah, call your mother.
[75:13.60]And here's the thing, right?
[75:15.28]If you didn't read that today, you know, maybe that made you think, you know, maybe I'll call my mother today.
[75:22.25]I'll call my mother tomorrow, right?
[75:27.95]Yeah, exactly.
[75:28.69]Like, you might have, you might feel like you need to do that a little bit more now.
[75:35.11]You might need to call your mother.
[75:36.44]yeah alright here's mine today you may think about competition and possible future goals ragefire chasm getting through that imagining and dreaming can serve you well what did you dream about as a kid who did you want to become are you close to this in your life now if not this is is this alright for you take time to think such things through and if need be get back on the right track
[76:00.06]I mean, you kind of, you did want to accomplish things in World of Warcraft as a kid.
[76:04.38]So you're kind of like there now.
[76:08.49]And Ragefire Chasm is coming up and the future goal.
[76:11.93]I dreamed, I dreamed about this.
[76:19.38]I'm out of range.
[76:22.88]I actually had a crazy dream last night.
[76:26.66]It was very short.
[76:29.56]So I was just in bed, and I kind of woke up for a little bit, and I felt kind of a presence.
[76:37.94]It was a presence dream.
[76:39.80]I was like, what is that?
[76:41.64]Something is... And I even kind of felt this before I went to bed.
[76:45.08]Like before I actually went into sleep, deep sleep, before I fell asleep.
[76:49.71]I was watching, like everybody does, like all, you know, all men do before they go to bed.
[76:56.20]They watch Red Green Compilations, an old Canadian television show of a handyman.
[77:01.51]And it's, you know, I was watching that, falling asleep to it.
[77:07.12]and uh I've got into the point where I was like something's in the room like this is weird and then I I was awake and I was like no like that I got this weird feeling though fell asleep and in the hallway in the dream I can kind of see like I can look up the doors open I can see the hallway
[77:25.06]There was an orange, a big orange fiery ball, like outside the door, like, like watching me, looking at me.
[77:34.89]And it was, it was bright and it was burning.
[77:37.89]It was big.
[77:38.79]Then I woke up.
[77:45.81]Oh, I got a double right there.
[77:51.78]It didn't hurt me or anything.
[77:52.90]It wasn't there to hurt me.
[77:54.34]It was just kind of there.
[77:55.38]So, yeah, you saw the eye of Sauron.
[77:58.97]No eye.
[77:59.59]It was just kind of like an orange fiery ball that was just sitting there looking at me.
[78:06.17]Didn't have eyes.
[78:06.83]It was just there.
[78:10.09]You know that orange fiery balls are kind of the descriptor of all the alien phenomenon going on lately, you know?
[78:19.44]Maybe they communicated to you in your dreams.
[78:24.04]What do they want from me?
[78:25.82]I was watching red green compilations.
[78:27.99]I wouldn't do anything that crazy.
[78:41.92]I watched him make an air hockey table out of a couple of dryers.
[78:49.96]Stupid.
[79:03.01]Hashem?
[79:03.81]Wait, what is it?
[79:05.47]Oh, I think that's one of the randoms that run around.
[79:08.01]The random high-level animals.
[79:13.58]Help the person in the game.
[79:16.52]Yeah, where did they go?
[79:24.60]You even said where.
[79:26.76]Yeah, I don't know where the... It's like a named NPC?
[79:31.48]Over here, over here.
[79:33.42]Oh, shit.
[79:33.88]Okay.
[79:37.21]It's only four levels higher than me.
[79:45.59]Will you get this?
[79:49.55]I think it's for a quest we don't have.
[79:50.91]Eh.
[79:58.27]Let me get this horoscope off.
[79:59.87]There we go.
[80:03.46]Oh, it's level 19, yeah.
[80:07.82]Where are the raptors?
[80:21.23]This one.
[80:29.29]Oh, there are two over here.
[80:29.95]Oh, yeah, I see him.
[80:41.84]Every time you talk about a dream, you make an animator work for two weeks.
[80:46.50]Oh, that one was not that.
[80:50.57]Like, that's not Mickey Mouse or anything.
[80:52.91]It was more like a joke there.
[80:54.81]More like an ominous observation.
[80:57.13]Yeah.
[80:57.23]Yeah.
[81:06.97]I got one of the Raptor ones done.
[81:13.97]How did the floating orb of fiery orange make you feel?
[81:20.19]I'm nervous.
[81:22.37]Mostly because there was an orange floating orb in the room and that was kind of what is that and why is it in the room?
[81:31.74]Was it like the room you were sleeping in?
[81:33.46]Yes.
[81:35.58]Oh, so like, it could have been like an out of body experience.
[81:38.47]So you were possibly observing something.
[81:42.32]Whoa, I just remembered the next part of the dream.
[81:45.26]You just, like, unlocked it.
[81:46.50]We've unlocked it.
[81:47.51]Whoa, okay, so I put my hand up.
[81:49.79]Because I was like, what is... And I felt my hand kind of start to... Like, blue strings and white and blue strings were kind of coming around my arm.
[82:01.31]And I started to get sucked up, like, my soul in a way.
[82:05.43]Like, I was... I was getting, like, pulled through, like, a wind tunnel.
[82:13.63]And then I woke up.
[82:15.11]There were like strings around your arm?
[82:17.95]It was kind of... Like tubes?
[82:22.01]No, like sheer... Sheer... Energy?
[82:26.49]Energy curtains.
[82:27.67]Sheer energy curtains kind of coming out of my hand and I'm kind of flowing into them.
[82:37.99]Did you... Were you like... Do you feel yourself getting like lifted off the bed?
[82:42.13]I did eat a tuna sandwich after midnight, so I don't know if that has anything to do with it.
[82:46.86]But yeah, I came out of the bed.
[82:48.40]I literally was floating out of the bed, flowing into whatever this was.
[82:51.58]Then I woke up.
[82:52.82]I don't want to be alarmist, but that's not good, bro.
[82:59.76]It's like an abduction dream.
[83:02.90]Did I get abducted by aliens last night?
[83:14.21]I mean, it is crazy that you had like a, like a fireball orb thing.
[83:18.43]Cause that is like the main identifier of the unidentified aerial stuff.
[83:25.82]What?
[83:26.06]Are you serious?
[83:27.42]Yeah, no, for real.
[83:35.68]And it's like, it's like a distortion.
[83:38.32]Like something is, is, uh,
[83:41.70]Like a Photoshop filter is over whatever's inside the sphere, you know what I mean?
[83:45.64]Yeah, no, it was, um, okay, do you know, what was that?
[83:49.98]That picture of... I don't know if it was like Mars or something.
[83:53.77]It was like the clearest picture of Mars we've ever had.
[83:56.11]It was a recent really big deal.
[83:59.55]It was a black hole.
[84:03.11]It kind of looked like that.
[84:04.01]It was orange.
[84:04.33]Oh, like an event horizon?
[84:06.37]I don't know.
[84:06.91]I wish I could draw.
[84:09.15]I wish I had an artistic ability.
[84:21.45]Still 18, be careful.
[84:23.19]Oh, oops.
[84:30.64]Resist, resist, resist.
[84:32.56]Okay, there's one right there.
[84:50.84]Also level 18, be careful.
[84:52.04]Maybe let the Voidwalker get... Oh no, you're out there.
[84:54.60]Your health is fine.
[85:01.54]He's going to kill my Voidwalker.
[85:14.05]That was close.
[85:15.41]Three levels higher than us is no joke.
[85:17.25]Yeah, it's a little scary.
[85:29.87]Imagine if I got abducted by aliens.
[85:32.55]I mean... It's a very vivid dream you're describing.
[85:37.81]Well, but I did... Okay, the dream did not continue to... Like the Pee Wee Herman movie where you... And then there's all this scary shit going on and like the clowns come in and the aliens are... That didn't happen.
[85:53.63]I just flowed into this thing and that was it.
[85:56.25]Yeah, but how do you know like you remember everything up and to the point?
[86:00.90]where it finished absorbing whatever it was absorbing, and then everything after that is just a blank spot.
[86:10.02]Hmm.
[86:12.28]Well, I mean, I have been drinking a lot of peppermint tea, so maybe that counteracted it.
[86:30.38]The fact that you were nervous, also, like, did you- what did you feel after you started, like, floating up off the bed?
[86:36.28]Honestly, more so surprised than scared.
[86:41.54]I wasn't scared of this thing, I was just surprised by it.
[86:44.24]It was- it was more of a... What are you doing there?
[86:47.84]What is that?
[86:49.40]Not a... Michael Myers, Jason's in the room and he's gonna chainsaw my head off!
[86:53.82]No, it was more- it was more surprise than scared.
[86:59.98]But it was weird because I'm telling you, before I went to sleep, for a solid 20 to 30 minutes before I went to bed, I had something just, it was like, it was something.
[87:09.74]I felt like somebody was in the room.
[87:12.60]Like, I got this weird feeling.
[87:13.64]There's something in here.
[87:14.44]Really?
[87:15.24]Oh yeah, it was weird.
[87:17.16]You didn't mention that before.
[87:27.75]Yeah, that part's made up.
[87:30.13]No, I'm laughing because somebody said something messed up in the chat.
[87:33.63]I'm laughing at it.
[87:37.73]They said something very specific and I would call it inappropriate.
[87:41.63]Okay, I got all the heads.
[87:46.07]We just need the horns now.
[87:47.47]Let's clear out this area first.
[87:51.71]Scared of this shit.
[88:10.01]Yeah, if we're talking about size... It was... It wasn't small.
[88:16.82]Uh, hold on.
[88:18.20]That's scary.
[88:20.58]The... Lion being right next to it.
[88:25.55]I think it will.
[88:28.13]I think you're good now, yeah.
[88:32.39]It was pretty, it was pretty big.
[88:34.31]I would say it was the size of... Are you talking about the orb?
[88:37.56]Yeah.
[88:38.80]Okay.
[88:43.88]If I were to give a good comparison, it was probably as big as...
[88:48.36]Ow, my body hurts.
[88:49.82]Like a washing machine?
[88:51.96]It was... Like, that's as big as it was.
[88:54.10]It was the size of a standard washing machine.
[88:56.77]So... Circle.
[88:58.41]It was floating.
[88:59.25]Was it floating, like, near you or over you?
[89:02.07]It was floating... It was in the doorway of my bedroom.
[89:12.05]Do you normally sleep with the door open or closed?
[89:14.50]Door was open.
[89:15.98]Like, but do you normally sleep with it open or closed?
[89:18.34]Yeah, the door is usually open.
[89:24.33]Let's get to this one here.
[89:29.99]I'm going to get a couple here.
[89:31.52]Pull back.
[89:34.28]Yeah, come back to me.
[89:37.34]That would have been a very scary pull.
[89:50.00]And you said you felt like there was a presence, like, 20-30 minutes before you went to sleep?
[89:54.50]Yeah.
[89:55.84]For sure.
[89:57.24]In fact, as I was watching these, uh, red-green compilations, uh, very, very fun.
[90:03.08]It's just really good.
[90:04.78]It's such great, kind of, sleep stuff, because it's... it's funny, but it's... it's a creative... it's... it's very good.
[90:11.13]I love it.
[90:12.31]Um...
[90:15.29]I just, I kept having to pause.
[90:16.75]I was like, what is it?
[90:19.00]That doesn't feel right.
[90:19.84]Like something's weird about this.
[90:22.56]But it wasn't scary.
[90:23.60]It was just weird.
[90:24.44]5G towers are frying your brain.
[90:32.03]I have a black tourmaline bracelet, okay?
[90:33.75]That's not true.
[90:44.74]Well, the good news is they brought you back.
[90:51.16]Yeah, weirdly enough, I hear sometimes now, ever since then, I hear the Windows print screen, like a screenshot sound every so often.
[91:02.04]When I look at an object, I pick up an object, let's say like a bottle of milk, I hear...
[91:14.05]Do you have many bottles of milk in your fridge?
[91:16.97]Two or three.
[91:18.07]How often does the milkman deliver the bottles of milk?
[91:25.92]I talked about how I wanted the milkman to come back.
[91:31.00]Too many milks, too many brands, too many of everything.
[91:34.68]Too much shit at the grocery store.
[91:44.76]You know why the milkman can't come back?
[91:49.72]Because he kept having sex with people's wives?
[92:06.70]Is that where you were going?
[92:08.06]No.
[92:12.98]God damn it.
[92:14.60]Oh, no, I was.
[92:15.44]I was gonna say the milkman can't come back because if there was a milk delivery service, we'd have to download another app.
[92:23.36]Oh yeah, yeah, that makes more sense.
[92:35.19]Do not run right into that.
[92:36.87]What are you thinking, Kalban?
[92:46.93]uber eats is the modern milkman yeah but what I was talking about is the milkman getting out of the car and doing a little skip step and whistling with the glass bottles and tipping his cap to everybody and of course I've got your delivery coming up here on Tuesday say what are the neighbors and then he has sex with your wife and then he ends up going back to the truck and
[93:16.16]yeah but if uber eats is the modern milkman I mean I don't think that they had a constantly rising subscription cost with extra taxes and fees that are obscured that are uh 22 of the order and you have to tip over 20 for the delivery yeah those apps are just they're so convenient but and then the drivers get screwed over so bad too don't they
[93:52.22]Anytime I order delivery, which is not really that often anymore, but I still do.
[93:57.69]I try to tip, give at least whatever, because I know like, oh, there's this fee that comes out, then that fee.
[94:03.13]I don't even know if they give all the tips to the drivers.
[94:06.66]They might not even do that.
[94:07.42]I don't know.
[94:08.86]I think that all the tips go to the drivers.
[94:11.10]The trick is that the like taxes and fees bracket is like you're tipping the restaurant unknowingly.
[94:16.85]Yeah.
[94:18.33]Because the tax, like if you pay like a $14 tax and fee, only like six of those dollars of taxes.
[94:26.95]So you're kind of like tipping twice.
[94:31.16]And on top of that, all the food is like $2 more expensive than if you picked it up in person.
[94:36.92]That's true.
[94:40.12]Like every line item is like $1.50 more or $2 more.
[94:48.12]Yeah, anytime I've ordered it, and if you order only a few things, too, it's, oh, your total bill is this, and the driver might get, like, $4.
[94:56.99]Like, that's... No.
[95:00.22]That being said, I use it all the time.
[95:07.88]I don't think that there's a streamer who doesn't use food delivery.
[95:11.14]I think it's just, like, unanimous.
[95:12.97]Oh, yeah.
[95:13.51]I mean, it's just the same...
[95:16.30]The Venn diagram is a perfect circle.
[95:19.44]Yeah.
[95:28.40]Honestly, I would imagine a lot of streamers are... a major much... a part of the customer base.
[95:34.57]A lot of the work from home, a lot of streamers.
[95:38.61]Aren't there some... a lot of streamers get Uber Eats like two or three times a day, right?
[95:45.80]Oh yeah, just for, like, lunch and dinner.
[95:49.66]But the real pros just get enough food on the first one to have leftovers.
[95:55.78]Yeah.
[95:58.77]But if you're live, you know, think about if you're live for 10, 12 hours at a time and you're, you know, taking a break to go pee.
[96:06.03]You're not really cooking dinner.
[96:09.96]Some people do that, though.
[96:10.82]Some people do, like, oh, I'll be back in a couple hours or something, right?
[96:13.82]People do that.
[96:15.16]That works, too.
[96:20.60]You still have... I only have one of these.
[96:25.24]Yeah, I don't know why the raptor horns are rarer than their heads.
[96:28.46]Uh, hold on.
[96:30.82]Pull that back.
[96:33.39]And, okay.
[96:34.95]Pull it back here.
[96:37.95]I'm just so afraid of, yeah, exactly what I was afraid of.
[96:40.56]Alright, we're good.
[97:00.24]Hey, I got one.
[97:03.38]Of course you do 16.
[97:06.02]Less than two bars.
[97:08.46]We could probably just turn in and be good.
[97:12.64]Yeah, the Raptor we can get the rest of the horns.
[97:15.75]They're everywhere.
[97:20.17]Why am I fighting this guy in my hand?
[97:31.27]There's one more down there.
[97:32.05]We'll kill this and we'll just get out of here.
[98:01.83]There's nothing on there.
[98:02.81]I don't think chat understands why we use, uh, food delivery so much.
[98:09.23]We're trying to stimulate local business.
[98:11.19]Okay.
[98:11.97]It's called the economy.
[98:13.25]Look it up.
[98:13.67]I think it's because a lot of times you just, you just want to be able to eat and go right back to it.
[98:24.17]Look, we, we pay people to deliver food to us for the same reason you pay people to have an icon next to your name in chat.
[98:31.01]Okay.
[98:32.86]because it makes you feel good filthy door dashers the statistically speaking at least one person has this stream on in the car while they're making a delivery right now from the like the dash
[99:06.96]That was for the crossroads.
[99:18.21]I want to get to 16 too.
[99:19.71]I might get there here.
[99:22.35]Where is it turning?
[99:24.25]Crossroads.
[99:27.03]I'll be close to it.
[99:27.86]Yeah, let me get the 16 too.
[99:29.24]I want the new spells.
[99:30.46]Because if I have the damage meter and threat meter up and I'm level 15 and I don't have my new ranks, I'm going to be way below the priests.
[99:40.15]And that's fine.
[99:40.81]It's in the title.
[99:41.31]You got to parse.
[99:43.15]I have to at least prove that I can do at least 10 damage a second.
[99:55.26]All day prepping for the raid.
[99:58.65]Yeah, but everything we're doing, if the goal is 60, everything is still working toward that, you know?
[100:04.66]It's true.
[100:28.10]Ah, gotta clear up my mailbox too.
[100:42.43]Oh, we gotta go to the Raptor Haven.
[101:01.19]I'm like 99%.
[101:07.99]Would you ever do anything like hot ones?
[101:10.89]Uh, no, no way.
[101:12.03]Not anymore.
[101:15.07]I've had a lot of digestive problems recently.
[101:17.74]That would be the worst possible thing I could do.
[101:20.36]Eating like hot spicy things right now.
[101:24.66]I've tried all the like, you know how they sell them in like boxes?
[101:31.04]You can get the whole kit, right?
[101:32.52]It's like a whole kit of tosses.
[101:34.78]Yeah, we've done like the whole box a couple times.
[101:39.10]Some of them are pretty good.
[101:42.54]I mean, I'm sure they're delicious.
[101:45.48]Ooh, perfect timing.
[101:46.33]Oh, yeah.
[101:48.95]Yeah, now there's no way we're going to lose now.
[101:55.93]We got one hour.
[101:57.11]Go.
[101:58.15]When does Onyxia drop?
[102:01.40]Okay, would it be funny if we just made sure we had all the flasks and every buff possible to do RFC?
[102:08.34]Can we unboon?
[102:16.03]I'm making the lifts right now.
[102:22.93]Walk with the Earth Mother.
[102:26.28]Get the Auctioneer add-on.
[102:28.76]If I join Only Fangs, I can't use the Auction House.
[102:34.11]So I can't.
[102:36.35]I can't do that.
[102:41.33]Alright, we got.
[102:50.03]We could do the Prowler Claws.
[102:56.07]I like how, looking at your map, we're clearing in a circle around the crossroads, so, like, all the quests are just getting progressively further out.
[103:06.12]Mm-hmm.
[103:09.82]These, the Harbury Raiders, is a good place to go, but that place is horrific, but with two of us, we'll be fine.
[103:16.12]There's the Raptors up there, too.
[103:17.98]Okay, let's do those two, complete it, and then get your new abilities.
[103:25.46]And then we're ready for RFC.
[103:28.09]Sounds good to me.
[103:34.85]But I do want to buy.
[103:35.85]What are you looking for?
[103:40.63]This shit is so expensive.
[103:43.72]Your blades never dull.
[103:48.56]Well, you've got you should have a lot of money from yesterday.
[103:58.42]Did anyone hear his mic picking up his ankle monitor beeping?
[104:13.85]Did those things beep?
[104:15.13]I don't think they beep.
[104:22.08]How would you sleep?
[104:22.90]That would be so annoying.
[104:24.20]Is that government mandated or do the aliens tag you?
[104:45.33]Ooh, Renew.
[104:46.57]That's what I... Hold on, my voice is getting... I must be... I got abducted.
[104:51.08]That's what happened.
[104:53.52]Okay, we're good.
[104:56.54]Renew is one of my favorite spells.
[104:58.34]Power Word Shield, Penance, and Prayer of Mending are my three favorite spells in the game.
[105:06.63]So why am I not playing a priest?
[105:11.89]I was going to ask the same thing.
[105:17.97]Wait, do these guys not drop the horns?
[105:23.05]Uh, not these ones, dude.
[105:24.35]We gotta go up to the harpy nest in the top left corner of the map.
[105:32.47]Half those moves are not even in Classic.
[105:34.05]Yeah, that's true.
[105:38.39]Alright, so when TBC rolls around, Prayer of Mending is introduced, which is the best spell in the game.
[105:45.81]Or is that in Wrath?
[105:46.43]No, it's TBC, right?
[106:00.87]Hardcore is not going to go into TBC.
[106:07.74]Do we know that for sure?
[106:09.00]Or have they kind of been flipping flip-flopping on it?
[106:20.52]It's for sure.
[106:26.17]That's alright.
[106:29.27]I definitely don't want to play Mists of Pandaria though.
[106:32.64]Because that's where they're going from Cataclysm.
[106:36.24]I would much rather play TBC than Mists.
[106:40.03]I really did not like Mists of Pandaria.
[106:46.76]that okay I misspoke a few weeks ago missa pandaria is when they made the whole game hey choose between these three things and I know it's arbitrary points but I like arbitrary icons and I like clicking five out of five ten out of ten I like to do that and you know what I think a lot of other people do too yeah I like the talent trees
[107:15.11]Hey, there you go.
[107:17.04]I like how we walked all the way out here for that.
[107:22.44]I don't know.
[107:22.88]Where's my Voidwalker?
[107:25.72]He's dead.
[107:29.50]Oops.
[107:38.01]The retail talent trees, I do have to give a little bit of credit to Blizzard here.
[107:44.21]The current retail talent trees are pretty fucking cool.
[107:49.82]They're actually really interesting.
[107:53.82]It feels... Do you want to go back?
[107:56.42]What was that?
[107:57.66]Do we want to go back or do we want to finish quest?
[108:00.60]Yeah, let's finish these things because I want to get to 16 too.
[108:03.06]Oh, okay.
[108:06.13]Unless do you want to like get this?
[108:09.28]The blessing you want to keep blessing and do our thing.
[108:13.22]We can probably get another one, but I'm I'm fine.
[108:16.11]Get into everyone is 16.
[108:17.65]I just want to make sure we're waiting on me.
[108:19.81]No, no, just I'm just leveling in.
[108:21.41]There's no rush.
[108:23.61]But yeah, the current talent trees, I don't think you learn abilities anymore.
[108:30.22]You have two trees.
[108:32.68]You pick your spec and then your general, this is the class you are playing tree.
[108:38.34]So each spec has a big huge tree and then you also get a big tree for the class.
[108:46.21]And there's a third one too.
[108:47.99]It's like Path of Exile now.
[108:52.45]There's like a hundred different places to put your points now.
[109:06.80]I think retail is just a little too extra.
[109:10.26]It's just like there's so many weird procs on procs of combinations of in this spell, in that spell, spell, big explosion, then this proc.
[109:21.94]I think we got all the claws.
[109:24.00]Yeah, we get them all.
[109:25.39]If we go straight up from here, there are raptors.
[109:27.87]Just going to grab copper and I'll catch up.
[109:31.75]I'll just wait.
[109:39.24]Retail is such a dog shit game.
[109:47.46]I don't think it's... I don't think it's dog shit.
[109:52.75]I would say it's kind of, um... Like, it's... It's alright.
[109:59.39]I think it's okay.
[110:00.34]I didn't hate it.
[110:02.90]I can't say that I loved it.
[110:05.56]But I... It was enjoyable.
[110:07.46]I enjoyed it.
[110:15.11]I didn't want to put a whole lot of time into it, but... I've checked in on it here and there.
[110:19.09]I think it's okay.
[110:24.79]war within is fun the legion high yeah what do you want from me alright we go straight up from here
[110:54.68]That's probably good for you.
[111:01.48]Any extra stamina is good for you to take an extra hit.
[111:13.31]Oh, are you, are you live by the way?
[111:16.43]No, currently choking.
[111:17.49]Okay, I just want to make sure I wasn't like, you know, like talking over, not muting if you were live or anything.
[111:29.90]I did the classic swallow down the wrong windpipe.
[111:34.72]Yep, classic classic wow.
[111:37.12]Classic wow hardcore wrong windpipe.
[111:46.73]Oh hello, that's the whole group.
[111:53.96]Let's hug this mountainside and we'll get rid of these.
[112:00.27]But no, I'm chilling until tomorrow.
[112:04.31]And then back to normal.
[112:06.19]Cool.
[112:09.90]Yeah, I want to make sure I wasn't doing the thing where I'm not muting my mic and you're like trying to talk to your chat.
[112:14.66]And I'm like, yeah, I won't.
[112:16.56]Whoa, shut up.
[112:26.75]I don't have mining 65.
[112:30.36]that's what tin tin needs 65 I thought 10 was like 40. I am at 62. this dude this dude is thanking subs who he he's just thanking subs he won't he won't use push to talk
[112:53.84]Oh, I thought you were talking about somebody, one of the people that were here.
[112:55.87]I was like, is somebody streaming?
[113:01.81]I was like, wait a minute, somebody here is streaming and they're getting a shitload of subs?
[113:05.19]Who, what do you, who is it?
[113:26.95]Alright, we gotta get Talons from the... This place is dangerous, so... They are our level, but... There's been plenty of deaths here.
[113:46.70]If they need the quest, we might as well just bring them in.
[113:54.37]Oh, actually, maybe that's a bad idea.
[113:55.95]Because then the drop rate will get worse.
[113:59.27]Correct.
[114:05.34]Oh, dodged.
[114:09.26]Fine trophy your head will make.
[114:16.72]It's always a good talent when somebody can do the suck-in screech.
[114:22.23]You know the one.
[114:23.39]The... I would try, but I don't want to get nominated for worst noise.
[114:35.16]Yeah.
[114:36.86]That's a very... That's possible to do there.
[114:39.62]Although the awards are permanently done, so there are no nominations anymore.
[114:52.71]Nominations are closed, yeah.
[115:12.50]Can't believe you shut him down so nobody else could take the throne.
[115:19.32]It will never be another award ceremony again.
[115:31.68]Yeah, the bright side.
[115:32.38]Somebody said that you can fart loudly now without any repercussions.
[115:35.28]That's true.
[115:35.66]And what are you going to do?
[115:40.45]Clip it?
[115:40.81]Whatever.
[115:51.80]Just blame it on Otto.
[116:17.59]what the fuck what the fuck I got blamed I didn't do anything favorite impractical joker uh when they went up to that guy that was a former olympian or something and they they were like oh hey I can't believe I met you and they kind of made the guy's day it was like really wholesome
[117:01.34]That's a good media trained response.
[117:21.32]pr andy media trained andy I've not gotten one of these things by the way I just got my first one
[117:44.27]What's wrong with me?
[117:49.83]What's wrong with me?
[117:50.27]What's wrong with my character?
[117:52.35]I see the orb.
[117:55.33]It's coming in through the window.
[118:04.11]Media trained to answer.
[118:05.41]Oh, that's funny.
[118:14.07]Uh, level 18 and we'd be careful here.
[118:30.54]Finally.
[118:32.80]uh we shouldn't go too deep in here I think the elite I think an elite spawns over there somewhere or up here I forget where I don't think it moves but I think there is like a 19 elite that spawns somewhere in this area is it here or is it in stone town I think it's up here like all the way north
[118:57.90]The level 18 stealth is crazy.
[119:00.02]Yep.
[119:01.22]People have died many times here.
[119:24.17]She's not elite, but she's high level.
[119:25.54]Okay, cool.
[119:31.70]Yeah, let's let me pull.
[119:33.38]Let's grab this one.
[119:36.88]OK, we're good.
[119:40.38]OK.
[119:55.07]Neapolitan ice cream.
[119:57.87]Which one are you getting rid of?
[119:59.34]You have to get rid of one permanently.
[120:02.95]Are you getting rid of strawberry?
[120:05.75]Are you getting rid of vanilla?
[120:07.77]Or are you getting rid of chocolate?
[120:10.27]Which one?
[120:13.95]My question is... Doesn't that... Doesn't... No matter what you pick, doesn't that just murder Neapolitan as a flavor?
[120:24.54]Yeah.
[120:25.82]But the... The crazy... This is an awful place.
[120:30.54]Let's go this way.
[120:37.08]The point is that those are the three kind of default ice cream flavors.
[120:41.83]Which one do you get rid of?
[120:42.55]Can we get a poll?
[120:43.97]I'm curious what everybody says.
[120:44.89]I mean, definitely strawberry.
[120:47.53]Actually, not for me.
[120:52.17]I actually think I would get rid of vanilla.
[121:02.43]We gotta stop attacking the gray ones.
[121:05.80]Let's head back towards the entrance.
[121:11.61]Yeah, smooth strawberry is... It's so good.
[121:17.67]Vanilla is just... I don't know.
[121:18.77]Vanilla is... But the thing is, you could get... Vanilla is a base for a lot of other really good things.
[121:25.92]That's the... Ooh.
[121:28.32]Too bad I have a staff, but... I'll just create it or whatever.
[121:40.39]Yeah, strawberry with no strawberry bits.
[121:43.51]Just smooth pink ice cream.
[121:49.10]It is probably one of the best flavors for me.
[121:54.41]At least if we're talking base level flavor.
[121:56.83]Counterpoint.
[121:57.29]Okay, you're evaluating your love for strawberry in isolation.
[122:01.85]But if we're talking about the question, which is in the Neapolitan flavor, what of the three ingredients would you get rid of?
[122:09.87]You're leaving strawberry and chocolate, which I think is worse than vanilla and chocolate together.
[122:18.73]Yeah, contextually, that's true.
[122:22.80]Contextually, I would say,
[122:25.43]Yeah, I would get rid of strawberry then.
[122:28.39]I'd be really sad about it.
[122:29.29]Nobody gets rid of chocolate.
[122:49.00]I think if you say that you would get rid of chocolate, I feel like... Wait, but... In the context of a Neapolitan, vanilla and strawberry actually would go together very well.
[122:59.75]So that's... I was going to talk a bunch of shit there.
[123:02.64]Never mind.
[123:04.42]I'll head back.
[123:34.17]There's a bunch over here.
[123:39.20]Alright, what's the verdict?
[123:48.81]A lot of chocolate.
[123:51.89]Chocolate is going to win of what to remove in the Neapolitan.
[123:56.81]That's surprising.
[124:02.27]Nobody wants to get rid of Vanilla.
[124:03.79]Vanilla is a permanent... It's grayed out.
[124:08.92]Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.
[124:30.66]Vanilla has to be there if it's going to mix with other flavors.
[124:32.77]Vanilla is like... Chocolate and strawberry, though.
[124:36.87]That's a classic flavor, though.
[124:38.43]Chocolate covered strawberries.
[124:40.91]If a Neapolitan was a sandwich, vanilla is the bread.
[124:47.52]Yeah.
[124:50.82]Would you say chocolate's the meat and strawberry is the condiment?
[124:54.96]Yeah, strawberry is like the lettuce and tomato.
[124:57.98]Yeah, chocolate would be the beef patty.
[125:04.30]Well, wouldn't that... That means you can't get rid of any of them then?
[125:08.28]If you want to... Yeah, that's what makes it Neapolitan.
[125:14.42]Welcome to our latest segment on the Food Network.
[125:19.97]We're talking today about Neapolitan ice cream.
[125:24.56]If you were to find every sentence that's ever been said on a stream or video, I think over the last, let's call it 13, 14 years, it probably would be 30% of every sentence is probably about food of some kind.
[125:42.95]It's probably true throughout human history.
[125:45.69]Is that all we do?
[125:46.29]Do we just talk about food?
[125:47.53]We just kind of talk about food.
[125:51.01]We talk about like food, shitting and dying.
[125:53.75]Those are the three truths of human life.
[125:58.47]It's kind of true though.
[126:01.27]That is probably 50 to 60% of every conversation I've ever had.
[126:13.14]Eating, shitting, dying and taxes.
[126:18.64]Eating, shitting, dying, love, and taxes.
[126:21.73]I think that that's kind of it.
[126:28.29]I just like the way this spell looks.
[126:43.27]That's why I do it.
[126:43.85]Oh, and World of Warcraft.
[126:46.31]Okay, of course, and wow.
[126:47.31]Okay, so eating, shitting, dying, taxes, wow, love, and, uh... Is this one of those, like, memory minigames?
[127:07.31]Yeah, I'm gonna hit 16 just by us killing these.
[127:11.98]But we're kind of in too deep now.
[127:13.28]When you get to about halfway, you're in too deep.
[127:16.14]You have to see it through.
[127:16.92]Talk about Family Guy a lot too.
[127:30.29]You know, I'm glad that people actually are coming around that like Family Guy and like Peter Griffin specifically are funny.
[127:36.57]I have been defending Peter Griffin and Family Guy for 10 years.
[127:40.45]I've been a staunch Family Guy, Peter Griffin defender.
[127:56.73]American Dad is better.
[127:58.01]That's true.
[127:58.69]But that doesn't mean that Peter Griffin is not good.
[128:04.09]He doesn't have his own qualities.
[128:14.02]For one second, I looked over and I thought I was on the starting soon screen the whole stream.
[128:18.70]And I was like, how did nobody talk about this yet?
[128:20.76]But no, that's just an old thing.
[128:25.27]The sad truth is some people wouldn't notice.
[128:29.23]There's probably people that just have this stream permanently minimized.
[128:33.93]And they're only here for the food talk.
[128:39.17]Hug the wall over here.
[128:44.67]Just because spawns could kill us.
[128:56.35]Is the Voidwalker dead?
[129:00.11]What killed the Voidwalker?
[129:04.51]That's kind of scary.
[129:05.31]Why is the Voidwalker dead?
[129:23.66]It's been dead.
[129:40.73]I wonder if I dream about the orb tonight.
[129:44.55]Okay, is me talking about the orb?
[129:46.50]I don't want to piss the orb off.
[129:48.68]I feel like now that you've identified it, it won't be able to come back, you know, or it'll have to erase your memory sooner.
[129:56.53]Holy shit.
[130:00.37]Oh, that does not look... Be careful over there.
[130:03.55]That was almost very scary for this mage here.
[130:18.79]Well, it didn't like tell me to do anything.
[130:20.55]You know, it wasn't like, Oh, you must, you must start a podcast.
[130:26.51]They didn't do that.
[130:27.14]Oh, you must remake Lord of the Rings shot for shot.
[130:34.70]Do it tomorrow.
[130:37.56]25 million has been deposited into your checking account.
[130:40.00]Go now.
[130:40.86]And I'd be like, 25 million.
[130:45.44]I'm going to be 250 million.
[131:16.80]I don't even think Peter Jackson could remake the Lord of the Rings.
[131:22.80]Lord knows he already tried with the Hobbit.
[131:25.58]I'm just kidding.
[131:26.58]And we all know, we all know that Etalyx is a Omega hater of the Hobbit series.
[131:33.52]Uh, I mean, okay.
[131:35.51]The Hobbit is retroactively made so much better because rings of power exists.
[131:41.35]So like I would actually watch it now.
[131:43.27]I would watch the Hobbit trilogy.
[131:48.62]Yeah.
[131:55.81]I think the... Wasn't the whole thing with that, like you were just saying, wasn't it like, hey, can you do three movies in like two years or something?
[132:03.68]And he was like, um, no.
[132:06.52]There was supposed to be another director.
[132:10.12]Wasn't it supposed to be Pan's Labyrinth?
[132:15.37]What's his name?
[132:16.33]Del Toro?
[132:17.49]Yeah, it wasn't supposed to be Guillermo Del Toro.
[132:20.19]Oh, that would have been awesome.
[132:28.74]And, uh, he had to, like, back out for some reason.
[132:32.50]And so the studio panicked and was like, ah, Peter Jackson, he did Lord of the Rings.
[132:37.28]We won so many fucking awards.
[132:41.70]Just get him back in here.
[132:42.68]It's a surefire bet.
[132:44.02]And we've got Orlando Bloom to kill elephants.
[132:49.39]And then they, like, we need to make three movies in two and a half years.
[132:59.23]But what about the part where they were in the river and bouncing people with their stomachs?
[133:08.19]That was pretty funny.
[133:12.79]I liked the dwarves.
[133:13.51]The dwarves were very... The acting, the dwarves were good.
[133:15.99]I liked the dwarves.
[133:17.65]I mean, the best reason to watch the Hobbit trilogy is smog.
[133:22.27]Yeah, I mean, that's... That second movie is just... That monologue is the best.
[133:36.49]I just want them to like make a TV show.
[133:39.40]Look, we don't need to have.
[133:42.91]Okay, here we go.
[133:44.11]It's the Lord of the Rings.
[133:48.67]Here comes the grand battles, and everybody has to die, and we need to show Sauron with his eye-floating orb.
[133:55.77]And then there's 10,000 enemies on screen.
[133:58.97]I would like a show if it was just the Dwarves Slice of Life Lord of the Rings Hobbit Show, or Slice of Life Lord of the Rings Dwarf Show.
[134:06.71]Yeah, I would like to see how the hobbits grow their weed.
[134:10.00]Yeah, I just want to see the hobbits smoking weed.
[134:12.62]I want to see the dwarves, like, farting in each other's faces and stuff.
[134:15.11]Like, you know, stupid shit like that.
[134:16.65]I just want to see them, like, drinking and... It's true, though.
[134:36.35]I just want to see.
[134:37.37]I want to see the dwarves...
[134:41.15]It's already a plot point.
[134:43.63]Yeah, but we don't get to see it.
[134:50.63]I want to see who built Bilbo's house.
[134:55.98]Yeah, but don't you want more of crack the pots and smash the plates?
[135:00.14]That's what Bilbo Baggins hates.
[135:02.12]So carefully, carefully with the plates.
[135:05.16]I don't care about like, oh, look at the guy got stabbed.
[135:08.38]Blood came through his nose.
[135:10.50]We've seen that 10,000 times already.
[135:12.92]I want more carefully, carefully with the plates.
[135:18.92]I want a Tom Bombadil origin story TV show.
[135:23.84]You will have so many musicals.
[135:26.00]It's true.
[135:41.69]I don't know how I did it, but during that excitement, I punched myself in the balls.
[135:44.77]I'm not kidding.
[135:45.27]They hurt a lot.
[135:47.55]Ow.
[135:48.15]How did that happen?
[135:48.93]Are you playing with motion controls?
[135:51.89]No, what?
[135:52.59]How did I get so excited that I punched myself in the balls?
[135:57.30]Ugh.
[136:15.76]Okay, I'm alright.
[136:23.46]Well, that's what happens when you play WoW three days in a row, you know?
[136:26.63]You think you come out of retirement, then you punch yourself in the balls and you go right back.
[136:31.11]Yeah, I said, you know, you know when your whole, your hips hurt and your stomach hurts after that?
[136:36.58]After getting hit in the balls?
[136:37.50]It sucks.
[136:38.88]My leg, I have a stomach ache now.
[136:56.14]you might have one on here no nope are we talking about like closed-fisted or like open-palmed
[137:11.26]I don't know.
[137:11.72]I really don't know.
[137:13.28]All I know is that after we were talking about the Hobbit stuff, I had realized that I had hit myself in the groin somehow.
[137:25.50]I think that's what a lot of people wanted to do after they saw the Hobbit.
[137:31.73]I may have sat on... I may have... I don't know.
[137:36.87]This is a mature audience stream.
[137:38.01]I don't care.
[137:46.35]Guys, guys, guys, people got like hitting the balls in PG movies back in the day.
[137:49.69]Alright, don't worry.
[137:50.39]Uh, you still need one or you got them all?
[137:54.99]Uh, got them all unless there's a second quest there.
[137:57.45]No, we're good.
[137:58.31]We can turn them in and get this party rolling.
[138:02.15]Is there like a named harpy quest for this area?
[138:05.19]I think maybe we have to like get to it.
[138:07.75]Yeah, I think it's we turn this one in and we get a part two.
[138:31.59]I'm so glad you just said that.
[138:33.58]My girlfriend does not understand the pain and anguish of sitting on your balls.
[138:42.37]I feel like this had to have been what happened because if I was emoting like I do usually with my hands, I would have hit the mic.
[138:47.83]The mic is right in front of me.
[139:00.52]I got you right in the orbs.
[139:02.17]Right in the bright orange orbs.
[139:22.21]Are you gonna do Only Fangs?
[139:24.03]I would definitely... I would join the guild.
[139:26.25]I think the only thing I would say is I don't think I'm gonna make it to any raids.
[139:31.12]I think I'm just gonna be the... the little, like, dork in the corner that is just kind of there sometimes.
[139:40.65]I'll be lucky if I make it to 30.
[139:56.81]Can you go to raids before level 60?
[140:01.83]Imagine Chaos Chris going to, like, Molten Core at level 30.
[140:05.33]You probably could on... If we were on, like, a Season of Discovery server.
[140:13.74]You can go in at 55.
[140:17.18]That's just... You're guaranteeing you're going to die.
[140:43.70]Okay, I want to do a 40-man Molten Core with 39 healers.
[140:51.23]And the whole goal is I have to solo every boss in the raid.
[140:58.71]Enrage timers would drown you.
[141:01.11]The enrage would be, yeah, it would happen in like 10 minutes.
[141:06.19]You would be swimming in lava for rag.
[141:12.52]As of Warlock, if there were 39 priests spam flash heals on me permanently, would I survive any of those encounters?
[141:27.45]Warlock can get pretty tanky.
[141:30.37]What about a group of 40 level 55s?
[141:32.11]That'd be crazy.
[141:41.53]40 level 55s.
[141:42.63]They just did 20.
[141:43.11]They did a 20 ban.
[141:45.57]That was crazy.
[141:50.35]Because yeah, Warlock has Demonic Embrace.
[141:55.12]There's a couple of ways to get the Blood Pact.
[141:57.98]Warlock is the tankiest cloth caster.
[142:01.14]Besides maybe Druid.
[142:05.63]I feel like I could take one hit if I just stacked a bunch of armor.
[142:13.21]Soul Link.
[142:13.69]Yeah, there's tons of weight.
[142:15.00]Look at this.
[142:15.32]Molten Giant would eat your face.
[142:30.51]But wouldn't that be kind of funny though?
[142:32.71]Like 38 priests or 39 priests and they're all holy.
[142:37.39]and we get in it's like I do a big speech of let's go it's gonna be so this is gonna be crazy for chaos chaos Chris in the building and then we pull the first thing I get killed by first auto attack and the whole raid scrambles to get out and like 15 more people die okay a raid where 39 people are healing you is taking the meme about main character energy in raids to the next level
[143:03.88]It would be what I'm imagining.
[143:05.34]Yeah, exactly.
[143:06.44]It would be the equivalent of when you play Team Fortress and you would turn around and they would just be eight medics with a beam right up your ass.
[143:17.35]You were unkillable.
[143:30.23]This guy thinks he's making a TF2 video.
[143:33.98]True.
[143:35.68]Alright, nice.
[143:41.40]Even less cast time.
[143:42.74]What is it right now?
[143:44.46]2.7?
[143:47.54]Nice.
[143:50.04]Soulfire is awesome.
[143:51.08]I can't wait to do that.
[143:53.03]Soulfire, if you guys don't know, is a 6 second cast.
[143:57.19]Just gigantic fireball.
[143:59.63]It's like Pyroblast.
[144:04.65]I am going to be... a just... I'm going to be just burning.
[144:14.66]It's also not supposed to be part of the regular rotation.
[144:19.04]But I'm not a regular guy.
[144:20.30]Oh, Otto.
[144:32.63]Otto is like, what was that?
[144:40.20]Okay, I want to go back to town.
[144:43.08]Before we do RFC, I want to take a break.
[144:45.98]I'm going to get some OT, stretch a little.
[144:49.56]Yep, I'm going to hearth back to Orc.
[144:53.40]And we got some new abilities to learn.
[145:10.74]Can you show Otto?
[145:11.98]I'll show him another time.
[145:13.30]He's just hanging out.
[145:16.10]My camera's not even set up anyways.
[145:18.24]Yeah, there's the harpy lieutenant rings.
[145:38.86]Hmm, taillight.
[145:39.82]Did I get enough cloth to do anything?
[145:43.80]Not really.
[145:44.20]Okay.
[145:58.41]Time to learn.
[145:59.19]You're only level 16, Omega LOL.
[146:10.64]Slow and steady wins the race.
[146:30.75]Okay.
[146:31.01]But what if it was a warrior?
[146:32.25]What if I'm, what if, uh, like, okay.
[146:33.81]Etalyx for instance, right?
[146:34.69]What if Etalyx gets a level 30 or 60?
[146:40.66]And went full protection.
[146:42.70]Just stacked as much armor and health as humanly possible.
[146:47.76]And then all the 39 priests could wand the boss.
[146:52.59]Do you think it would still work?
[146:53.99]Oh, no.
[147:13.88]Not if you're fire.
[147:23.19]Let me solo him.
[147:25.69]Holly, did you see that I'm doing destruction?
[147:29.07]I'm going all the way down the tree.
[147:31.73]Yeah, you know that already.
[147:32.71]I already told you.
[147:48.86]Alright, I'm going to take a break while we land.
[147:50.78]I'll be back in like five minutes.
[147:53.66]Sounds good.
[147:54.34]Same.
[147:55.90]See you in a minute.
[148:19.20]Yeah, when I land, I'll go to the BRB screen.
[148:25.37]I just walked right off.
[148:26.15]I don't think that's death, though.
[148:27.83]I'll be right back.
[148:35.77]Ad's incoming, by the way, if you're not tabbed in.
[148:37.92]See you in a few minutes.
[149:00.54]Thank you.
[150:02.35]so so
[151:30.04]Okay.
[152:31.24]you
[153:57.56]you
[154:58.90]Thank you.
[156:25.49]So,
[157:30.48]Thank you.
[158:00.14]Hello.
[158:00.84]Sorry, I was making tea and it took longer than I wanted it to.
[158:11.72]Were you in a city?
[158:12.52]Because we just got rend again.
[158:25.07]Oh, shut up.
[158:25.55]I'm muted.
[158:26.35]Oops.
[158:29.31]Hey, Lucky, we just got rend right now.
[158:32.87]Just got back.
[158:35.29]Now we got one hour to speedrun the dungeon.
[158:38.05]Oh my god, my sensitivity was so high.
[158:40.73]Why?
[158:42.09]Alright, so how do you want to do this?
[158:43.80]Do you want to... There are people that would do it.
[158:47.34]There is the guild you could ask, potentially.
[161:50.20]Chad, is this better?
[161:50.86]It's definitely better.
[161:56.91]We good now?
[162:04.64]Alright, so two DPS.
[162:05.64]I mean, we do have... I mean, do we...
[162:12.87]do we give do we give Otto the dog a uh an opportunity to to go to come to RFC oh I wonder who wants to go to RFC hmm I am I wonder I can't can't be anybody that's over here no no way bring the entire family
[162:40.92]Well, OK, if we wipe an RSC, you're wiping my whole family.
[162:47.54]Etalyx, you got a lot of responsibility here.
[162:49.75]My entire family is going to be in this dungeon.
[162:55.01]That is a lot of responsibility.
[163:01.17]But I know who I'm sacrificing first.
[163:04.15]You have to protect me and my girlfriend.
[163:10.53]And my mother's not playing, right?
[163:23.43]I'm going to get a text right now saying like, oh, hey son, I made it to level 16 and I'm a warlock just like you.
[163:31.14]I'll be like, mom, don't come.
[163:33.04]Mom, don't come to the raid.
[163:34.64]Do not show up to the raid, ma.
[163:44.79]In addition to the people who are currently following you around everywhere, I've had like three or four other people trying to message me to get in.
[163:54.83]Like, oh, you know, he's not going to read it.
[163:56.60]But if we message Etalyx, he might read it and then he'll vouch for us.
[164:00.44]Oh, God.
[164:10.30]Well, here's the problem, though.
[164:11.84]You're all casters.
[164:15.01]If a good piece of gear drops, we have to all... I don't want to fight the whole family over this.
[164:24.12]Okay, how about this?
[164:26.42]Are you actually going to take some of these people?
[164:32.42]I don't know.
[164:33.08]Does that enable the behavior?
[164:34.98]I think that enables the behavior.
[164:36.36]It's pretty enabled, yeah.
[164:37.46]But if you are going to do it, then the classic way is just make them roll.
[164:40.48]Hmm.
[164:46.98]Well, I need to learn my abilities first.
[164:48.26]Let's do that.
[165:11.57]Duel to the death for the one spot in the group.
[165:17.06]Oh, that's kind of, that's interesting.
[165:23.76]We'll have two spots, so.
[165:30.83]I feel bad if doing that for the one of these three people that installed the game two days ago.
[165:39.38]that genuinely have no idea how to actually really play the class.
[165:44.64]And who knows?
[165:46.10]It's very, very possible.
[165:49.14]Yeah, for instance, I don't know if this person necessarily knows how to PvP as a priest.
[166:02.77]We don't have a turn in now.
[166:03.53]We don't have a turn in.
[166:12.11]There we go over here.
[166:13.35]What do I get?
[166:18.07]That's it for level 16.
[166:19.53]I get underwater breathing and life tap.
[166:22.87]That's actually pretty good.
[166:25.33]My 16 sucks too.
[166:28.21]I thought I was going to get like another corruption or I thought it was I thought for sure.
[166:33.62]What is rank 2 corruption?
[166:35.82]Oh no corruption agony.
[166:38.22]18 of course.
[166:38.60]Okay.
[166:39.22]Go forth to victory.
[166:45.63]What can I help you with?
[166:48.15]Ooh, blood pact rank two.
[166:49.59]Fire shield.
[166:56.37]Ooh.
[167:03.72]Sacrifice.
[167:05.74]Did I already get this?
[167:08.00]No, this is the one that I really want, isn't it?
[167:12.06]He's got a shitload of subs.
[167:14.87]Oh, well, thank you.
[167:17.23]I don't really shout out any subs anymore, but if people still do, I appreciate it, but... Yeah, thank you.
[167:36.24]That's a fucking lot of money.
[167:40.98]That's a shitload of money, actually.
[167:51.10]Oh, it was 200.
[167:55.94]Holy shit, why are you giving me 200 subs?
[168:01.57]Thank you.
[168:11.99]What can I do for you?
[168:20.55]Yeah, for those of you that are... I have a... I implemented a pretty strict policy years ago of not shouting out subs or anything.
[168:30.41]This is like as of... I want to say like what, two or three years ago?
[168:49.22]But that is a lot.
[168:50.54]Yeah, that is a lot.
[168:53.34]And the fact that anybody would want to give that much money to this channel still, even to this day when I don't stream that much, is crazy.
[169:00.80]So I do appreciate it.
[169:02.37]Thank you.
[169:02.65]Alright, I'll go give 100 to Etalyx.
[169:18.87]whoa whoa whoa don't don't drag me into this no I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm not gonna encourage people to do that I'm just messing around you're gonna have to double that if you want to come to my channel
[169:48.02]My channel policy is I do not thank subs unless they put me in another tax bracket, and then I ban them.
[169:56.01]Ooh.
[169:57.63]Diabolical.
[170:03.95]Holly, are you on WoW?
[170:05.79]Let's see.
[170:16.74]We might get another Rend.
[170:17.80]Oh, we just did.
[170:18.40]Nice.
[170:33.43]Oh, the Valentine's buff too.
[170:34.75]We could be total just tryhards and have a million health.
[170:47.14]Did I even buy Lifetap?
[170:50.74]I didn't even buy it.
[170:51.56]I just looked at it and got angry and walked away.
[170:55.35]I'm leader right now.
[171:01.57]I don't think the stream can move on until you read each of the 200 subs individually and welcome all of the new members into the germs.
[171:14.25]That would take a while.
[171:19.32]You're the worst fastest hyper.
[171:22.74]Glory to the horde.
[171:28.98]Go with honor.
[171:32.17]Well, we still have to put slashes in.
[171:33.63]I have so much bullshit.
[171:38.53]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[171:39.03]I want to... Where is my Voidwalker?
[171:40.41]Because that thing is the best move in the whole game.
[171:43.41]I think I finally got it.
[171:52.49]Yep.
[171:53.09]Okay.
[171:53.49]So, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to take a look at this move that I just got.
[171:58.09]So, the Voidwalker.
[172:00.21]I can do this now.
[172:02.33]I can sacrifice the Voidwalker and get a... essentially a Power Word shield on me that absorbs effectively half of my entire health pool.
[172:12.94]Without the buff, it's almost my whole health pool.
[172:14.98]It's a 300 HP shield that lasts for 30 seconds.
[172:21.93]If you want to see a demonstration.
[172:27.33]I am now invincible.
[172:29.73]For 30 seconds.
[172:32.53]This is the oh shit.
[172:33.83]Drink that.
[172:34.87]Drink the swiftness potion.
[172:36.59]Eat the fucking hellstone.
[172:37.75]Drink a potion.
[172:38.77]Bandage.
[172:39.29]Eat the fish.
[172:39.87]And be running as fast as I can.
[172:41.35]Double movement speed.
[172:42.85]And get to the instance exit as fast as possible.
[172:52.21]not invincible it's an absorb you are invincible until the absorb comes off you are technically invincible while the shield is active and it's a very big shield so it's it's a roach button oh my god yeah I I wish I want to name a bar I want a different bar I think I'm going to have this be the roach bar
[173:19.88]I'm going to put everything.
[173:21.18]Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[173:22.34]Because then I'll know where to look to if I want to.
[173:25.59]If it's an oh shit, get me out of here.
[173:39.46]We're going to destroy RFC by the way.
[173:41.56]It's not even going to be a problem.
[173:44.48]That is the goal, yeah.
[173:46.64]I can't put that on the bar.
[173:47.68]I probably can.
[173:51.26]if we wanted to like pretend to die at every single pull we could have done it we were level 13. but like tanking under level 15 is pretty risky though yeah I think it'd be okay as long as there's enough we have enough damage which I think we should
[174:28.32]Another 100 gifted subs.
[174:33.28]Oh my goodness.
[174:36.26]I don't think I've seen a 300 gift.
[174:38.38]It's been like a couple of years.
[174:41.56]Holy shit.
[174:52.04]Is it because I streamed three or four days in a row?
[174:57.71]thank you though appreciate it it's a lot of money it's 100 gift subs for each stream it's because of wow what you mean to tell me is I gotta I play World of Warcraft and people are gonna people pay me money for the horde trying to keep trying to keep me around
[175:28.66]he's gonna spend it all on doordash would I don't know would somebody buy this level 13 probably not ever you ever you ever ordered delivery cookies delivery cookies yeah I don't think so you should
[175:58.78]Pretty damn good.
[176:00.72]Cookie delivery.
[176:01.44]I mean, that sounds amazing.
[176:16.94]Oh, she has target dummy.
[176:17.96]OK.
[176:19.86]I will giga heal.
[176:23.87]Alright, we're good.
[176:26.72]Holly is actually goaded at this game.
[176:33.95]We're in good hands.
[176:37.31]Insomnia over crumble all day.
[176:43.96]What's the best cookie you ever had?
[176:51.16]The best cookie I've ever had is definitely the perfect...
[176:56.22]First of all, on average, I'm a chocolate chip guy, but the best cookie is definitely like a peanut butter Reese's like that.
[177:03.96]There has been one peanut butter Reese's that made me stop what I was doing and go, damn, I'll never have that again.
[177:10.77]Peanut butter Reese's is all good.
[177:16.38]The best single from a store, the best cookie I've ever eaten in my whole life was from Disney World.
[177:23.25]And it was from, I think the place is called, is it called Gideon's?
[177:28.33]That is the best single cookie I've ever eaten in my whole life.
[177:36.70]What was it called?
[177:38.06]Gideon's in Disney World.
[177:41.60]It's part of that boardwalk place.
[177:44.28]It's the old boardwalk.
[177:45.33]Oh, yeah.
[177:46.91]I haven't been to Disney World.
[177:47.81]I've been to Universal.
[177:51.61]If you ever get, if you ever find yourself in Disney World and you're at that old-fashioned boardwalk part of, um, it's a part, it's not Epcot, is it?
[177:58.92]It's off the park a little, I think.
[178:02.42]Disney Springs, yeah.
[178:03.14]If you ever find yourself in Disney Springs and you go to Gideon's, you want to get there early.
[178:07.00]It's one of those scenarios where they sell out of everything in the first two or hour or two of being open.
[178:14.83]So get there early and get the chocolate chip cookie and get a coffee and be upset that you can't.
[178:22.44]If you're on vacation, you can't have that until you come back.
[178:31.53]Are they like big cookies?
[178:35.13]More on the crunchy or the soft side?
[178:38.40]They're soft.
[178:39.12]It's very soft.
[178:40.64]Chewy.
[178:42.92]It's almost not even a cookie.
[178:44.18]It's like a mound.
[178:46.02]It's a cookie mound.
[178:47.30]Alright, so how are we going to do this?
[178:57.69]Are people going to fight to the death here?
[179:01.45]Or is that not good?
[179:03.82]What are we going to do?
[179:06.25]We've got a mage, priest, shaman.
[179:14.90]Alright.
[179:15.26]Alright.
[179:15.48]Make the case.
[179:18.40]I want you to make the case.
[179:23.21]That was a pretty good case on the left there.
[179:25.65]Alright.
[179:26.11]We actually want a rogue.
[179:28.97]And actually, we just want two rogues because then no one competes for loot.
[179:34.69]That's also true.
[179:44.10]if you if you take uh if you know what four casters that sounds pretty good to me I get all the the mail drops I get the sword I get the shield I don't think it really I don't think it matters we're gonna miss it on some sick greens dude it is it is rfc we're gonna just probably steamroll the whole thing look these screens are gonna carry us to at least level 17. alright I'm making my I've made my decision
[180:13.22]Uh, we're taking the shaman.
[180:18.22]Okay, we get this room for one more.
[180:19.36]Uh, because shaman, that's, you know, leather.
[180:23.26]That's a whole nother... So now it's between, um, Otto the dog and Hatsune Miku.
[180:28.80]And, um, yes, I know I'm enabling people to, uh, run behind us.
[180:34.02]But... We're just having fun.
[180:36.10]Whatever.
[180:36.42]I don't give a fuck.
[180:38.42]Uh, this is going to be chat's choice.
[180:40.82]Uh, the reason why I want to do it like this is because, uh, chat, you have to pick between Otto the dog and Hatsune Miku.
[180:48.25]And you're all a bunch of fucking weirdos.
[180:50.03]This is going to be impossible for you.
[180:51.41]So good luck.
[181:04.87]Yeah, it's between these two.
[181:06.47]This is a 15 mage and a 9.
[181:09.75]Okay, well, 15 mage is a little low.
[181:20.68]You should make them fight.
[181:23.16]That would be a very unfair fight considering three levels, four levels that the priest has on the mage.
[181:41.07]This would be more of a fair fight.
[181:43.66]Although Shaman versus Priest, who wins in a Shaman versus Priest PvP?
[181:58.63]This is close, but I think... I'm actually not upset about this because I might actually get higher on the DPS charts than the dog.
[182:20.62]Yeah.
[182:21.82]Sorry, uh... Sorry.
[182:27.38]But you know what?
[182:27.92]It is... I'll tell you, it is good to be... Finding people for dungeons is actually kind of a huge pain in the ass, especially the low-level dungeons.
[182:34.49]So... It's all good.
[182:41.26]Alright.
[182:43.44]Well...
[182:45.75]I wonder if if we if we're going to again that scared that like hurt my head and scared me.
[182:52.10]But perfect timing.
[183:02.29]Are we ready?
[183:02.75]RFC is fucking easy.
[183:06.09]We're going to be fine.
[183:15.55]Let me upgrade this.
[183:18.43]Seven stamina.
[183:19.37]Holy shit.
[183:19.85]That's a huge boost.
[183:22.23]And fire shield.
[183:22.97]Look at fire shield.
[183:23.57]Fire shield's awesome.
[183:26.63]Fire shield gives somebody thorns.
[183:28.80]I should get... Okay, will the imp automatically give it to the tank?
[183:36.14]Like I can do it manually because it's a cool thorns.
[183:39.35]Will he automatically give it to the tank?
[183:42.87]Oh shit.
[183:43.13]Let me get my like stuff set up.
[183:47.03]I also have a question for chat.
[183:48.41]Am I supposed to, as a warrior tank, am I supposed to just be in defensive stance the whole time?
[183:53.88]Because if I swap stances, I just lose rage, right?
[183:58.44]Until I get tactical mastery?
[184:05.08]Yeah, D stance.
[184:09.19]I'm going to be holding back a lot.
[184:11.65]My threat meter is not even set up.
[184:13.01]Hold on.
[184:19.06]Oh shit.
[184:19.80]Do I not have it?
[184:25.57]Oh no, here we go.
[184:27.07]Options panel.
[184:28.59]Oh, there it is.
[184:29.09]Okay.
[184:29.49]Now it's no plugins.
[184:37.13]There it is.
[184:38.08]Okay.
[184:38.28]Tiny threat.
[184:39.24]There it is.
[184:41.60]How do I get it up?
[184:46.34]Oh no, no way.
[184:46.80]I do new window, right?
[184:51.32]How do I do this?
[184:59.88]How do I do this?
[185:01.66]Cogwheel then... Oh, there it is.
[185:04.08]Tiny threat, but how do I get another window?
[185:10.12]Oh, create window.
[185:10.76]There it is.
[185:11.32]Now I'll make this tiny threat.
[185:15.66]Oh my God, stop it.
[185:17.98]It's so small.
[185:23.76]OK, then that goes here.
[185:25.94]Do you like attach it?
[185:38.97]Alright.
[185:44.05]I'm ready.
[185:49.19]Get out of here.
[185:55.95]Oh, right.
[186:00.18]Oh, I got two of those already.
[186:01.28]You definitely keep it because we might need a roach.
[186:04.32]I'll take that one, though.
[186:05.18]I'll take those.
[186:13.83]Get the peggle add-on.
[186:15.75]Do you have that, Etalyx, or no?
[186:18.87]Peggle?
[186:19.55]No, I don't have that one.
[186:21.10]We could do a tournament with them.
[186:25.49]Alright, buff up.
[186:30.47]Alright, everybody buff the fuck up.
[186:44.76]Imagine going this hard for RFC.
[186:48.22]Alright, I'm going in.
[186:54.00]Let's go.
[186:56.93]Your inventory is full of shit.
[186:59.35]Whatever, it's fine.
[187:09.46]These are too big on the screen.
[187:10.64]My UI is too huge.
[187:19.28]Oh yeah, we can share quests, I think, right?
[187:21.99]Yeah, I'm sharing some.
[187:34.92]Demon skin buff.
[187:35.74]Yep.
[187:36.00]Thank you.
[187:40.48]Your screen looks like you got horse blinders on, dude.
[187:43.48]What do you mean?
[187:45.71]Like tunnel.
[187:46.83]If you only look at the dead center of the screen, that's fine.
[187:51.67]Is that bad?
[187:52.23]Hey, if it works for you.
[187:57.69]You said we didn't have a horse vision.
[188:00.62]It's an Ubisoft HUD.
[188:09.81]Hey, I'm good.
[188:10.67]This is how I play.
[188:13.20]And hey, watch this.
[188:14.76]I'll be at 20 DPS.
[188:16.48]I'm pulling.
[188:22.14]I don't actually know how many things we can take at the same time.
[188:24.76]I'm sure you could probably pull this whole group and be fine.
[188:32.02]Yeah, let's play it safe.
[188:33.26]Have you ever tanked before in Classic at all?
[188:36.18]I've tanked in other MMOs.
[188:37.62]Yeah.
[188:44.61]I used to be a tank in a little bit of slow tour.
[188:49.01]Auto the dog is destroying the charts right now.
[188:52.47]He's level 15.
[188:57.11]He's got a lot to prove apparently.
[189:08.59]Mage is a main character class, yeah.
[189:21.34]You are destroying, though.
[189:22.54]You're doing a lot of damage.
[189:23.74]I mean, tanks early have an advantage since I get to attack first.
[189:30.19]Line of sight, what?
[189:50.99]I forget I can do this in dungeons, because there's a healer.
[190:08.89]Yeah, don't worry, she'll heal me.
[190:13.34]Hey, she'll take care of me, don't worry.
[190:17.96]I have absolute faith.
[190:21.21]I mean, some of that is because I have an extra 500 HP because of Rendon Valentine's Day.
[190:29.65]But, you know, besides that... Yeah, we're kind of... We're kind of... This is going well.
[190:42.40]Do we have to pick anything up or no?
[190:43.54]I think it's... I think this is the room...
[190:51.14]I don't have any AOE yet, do I?
[190:52.41]No, I don't think so.
[190:53.11]I think I'm just going to dot, dot, dot.
[191:01.21]Alright, yeah, let's be careful.
[191:24.19]Good.
[191:30.80]I'll wait for some mana from our friends.
[191:33.82]As long as Etalyx keep aggro and you don't smurf pull the entire instance, you'll be fine.
[191:39.34]See, that's what I was afraid of.
[191:42.27]I was afraid of like, you know, let's say like one of these people just kind of running in there and just being like doing the JermaCraft copy pasta and pulling the whole dungeon.
[191:53.28]Like, you know, you got to be careful.
[192:10.96]I think I can pull the one on the left by himself.
[192:13.74]Don't even fuck around.
[192:17.87]Yeah, you got it.
[192:23.83]Alright, I have to have to turn off like the bubbles.
[192:41.17]Unless you get a little bit of aggro here.
[192:45.65]There are a couple of scary pulls here.
[192:48.13]Yeah, it can get scary for sure.
[192:49.73]But yeah, the main thing is, I think for caster is just to kind of conserve your mana and just do basic attacks sometimes since we kind of can keep rage building.
[193:00.36]Dude, when I ran this, the tank was just like a pinball just going to every single pack so fast I couldn't keep up.
[193:09.08]Whereas I'm standing here yapping, so I guess I'll get started.
[193:12.43]No, I would rather live.
[193:14.17]I'd rather live than clear this fast.
[193:56.50]Clean.
[193:57.82]Clean.
[193:58.18]Oh, first drop.
[194:03.22]That's pretty good.
[194:07.62]And hey, you everybody need on this shit if you need it.
[194:13.16]Yeah, don't you don't.
[194:14.02]You don't have to make sure you don't don't like you don't funnel loot to the streamers.
[194:17.48]Don't worry.
[194:29.42]just keeps dropping dude that's good for you do you have yeah it's kind of a side grade it's like one less stem but one strength instead so I can already have one I got it anyway people may as well think we were going to onyxia I don't know if I can line a site the other dude
[195:15.58]We're going to get some good experience here.
[195:35.07]What was that?
[195:36.77]There's a trog over there.
[195:37.53]I think there's a troll over there.
[195:38.87]What was that?
[195:39.25]That's weird.
[195:41.09]I think we're going to take one or more of these paths around.
[195:43.59]And we'll catch him on the loop.
[196:05.15]Big crit right there.
[196:06.11]Was that a personal best?
[196:06.93]Was that a PB?
[196:10.30]82, that's a big number.
[196:31.87]It's so funny how Wanding just does so much DPS.
[196:35.19]I know this is like a linear dungeon, but I don't know the difference in the left or right, right there.
[196:39.09]So I'm just gonna look over here.
[196:40.76]I think we need to kill all these dudes anyway, right?
[196:44.26]Probably.
[196:59.47]I should I could probably just hold on speak slowly.
[197:03.69]I should probably turn off the name plates for totems and shit, right?
[197:12.28]Where is that?
[197:16.70]Here we go.
[197:19.38]Yeah, that's much better.
[197:22.92]OK.
[197:24.04]Gotta go the other way.
[197:27.27]I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[197:28.71]Is there just two paths up here?
[197:30.57]It's like a straight line, but still.
[197:32.49]Dude, the first time I did this, I got to follow someone else.
[197:36.89]My DPS... Hey, Warlock scales much later, okay?
[197:40.40]You need to give me, like... I got to get to tier two.
[197:43.84]That's when just Warlock shines.
[197:48.30]Just don't fall in the lava.
[197:49.68]That's the one way we actually could die.
[198:06.21]Warlock is all about cursing, banishing, and big crits later.
[198:11.83]Ooh.
[198:38.83]Pretty good.
[198:39.53]I also think Warlock shines on boss fights single target because dots take awhile to ramp up.
[198:53.72]And casting Shadow Bolt takes 3 seconds or so, so I kind of hey just just wait.
[198:58.92]I'll be up here in about one minute.
[199:01.06]We get that first boss.
[199:01.92]I'm going to smoke the meter.
[199:17.57]Agony ramps up.
[199:18.34]Yeah, you gotta get agony out quick on the boss.
[199:47.23]Hey, we did it.
[199:52.19]I love everyone's quest-y auto-update posting at the same time.
[200:15.21]Big numbers.
[200:22.43]Honestly, you should just wand.
[200:25.27]Probably.
[200:31.15]Definitely a wand is just better is just shadow bolts 3 seconds.
[201:09.46]Maybe I should go Affliction.
[201:11.28]I'm going to be so all over the place if I continue to play this character.
[201:18.41]This is a dead end and I knew that.
[201:20.61]Oh, I just ripped aggro.
[201:30.22]Oh, you guys are toasted.
[201:41.81]I was doing so much damage that I've ripped aggro.
[201:45.54]What we did mention is this is a full clear of RFC.
[201:51.60]We just walked all the way over here.
[201:53.97]I wonder if there's a reason to do that.
[201:55.97]Trying to get 100% completion on this dungeon.
[202:00.73]Trying to platinum WoW.
[202:01.73]Get every achievo.
[202:03.28]Carried by randoms.
[202:06.87]Hey, that's not true.
[202:09.26]Just wait till we get to the first boss.
[202:11.34]Everybody, I want, mods, I want you to ban every single person when I get to top of the meter at the first boss.
[202:22.40]I want a one minute timeout to every single person in chat right now.
[202:27.59]I want a slash timeout all five seconds.
[202:55.52]when we get to the tough enemies we're gonna have to teach some party members to uh attack the person that the tank is attacking is it my problem
[203:08.43]I don't know.
[203:11.33]We're going to have to teach people some target of target hotkeys.
[203:15.03]It's F, right?
[203:15.71]I think it's F. Are you targeting something?
[203:22.88]Yeah, it's F. I am now.
[203:26.30]It's up, right?
[203:27.12]Not down the other path.
[203:31.34]I think there is a quest I think we have to do up here.
[203:35.43]oh Holly where do we go Holly's about yeah Holly's about to tell us like what to do okay oh the quest is here yeah
[204:11.46]Oh yeah.
[204:14.51]I want to get a crit so I can do more damage.
[204:25.46]How you bet you you're playing?
[204:28.66]You're in the game and you're betting on the game.
[204:30.68]This is a match fixing match fixing honey.
[204:36.48]That's going to be a three game suspension at least.
[204:45.54]Oh, I always want to death roll.
[204:46.50]Are you serious?
[204:47.07]Oh, yeah.
[205:01.72]Okay.
[205:24.36]Let's freaking go.
[205:31.39]I'm just letting you get to the top because I'm using Sunder, which, as we all know, is something that warriors only do when they're team players.
[205:38.59]Just wait until I get Conflagrate and I go... I get a max out crit, max out spell power, max fire damage, and get ruined.
[205:51.96]And I'm going to be doing... And soul fire, I mean.
[205:54.50]Soul fire crits are going to be like... I'm going to do like 5,000 to 10,000 damage soul fire crits.
[206:07.27]it's a person that said sunder isn't good it generates threat yeah sunder is one of your main threat generating moves I think right
[206:45.40]My imp is not even attacking this guy.
[206:46.74]That's like a third of my damage.
[206:54.33]Ooh.
[207:01.65]Alright, there's a boss in here.
[207:04.47]Anything we have to think anything about this?
[207:07.43]Is he gonna like just some some schmo doesn't do like a cyclone move that knocks into the lava.
[207:14.24]There is a guy that can knock us into the lava, but he's not this guy, OK?
[207:20.10]So what's priority here?
[207:20.94]We just going we kill ads and then him.
[207:23.43]I think that's yeah, just kill everything.
[207:24.79]I think it's a tank and spake.
[207:25.87]If you want to get try hard, you can probably CC one of the ads.
[207:30.42]Um, I have fear, but I don't know if that would be good or not.
[207:34.81]I think we're good.
[207:41.35]OK, guys, listen up.
[207:43.09]We're going to do skull.
[207:44.37]Then we're going to do moon.
[207:45.77]And after the two ads are dead, I want to wait for me to get threat.
[207:50.85]And then once I've gotten threat, pump.
[207:52.73]I want you to pump.
[207:54.29]You got it.
[207:54.81]And honestly, good, good comms here.
[207:57.88]Yeah, we're...
[208:00.57]Guys, we're in here with a dog, okay?
[208:02.41]But my dog is playing.
[208:08.26]Alright, I'm going in.
[208:35.17]Oh shit, Ogleflint's attacking me.
[208:36.73]I gotta chill, I gotta chill.
[208:46.43]Okay.
[208:46.53]Ooh, what's that?
[209:09.09]That's actually... Engineers need that, right?
[209:16.24]I am also an Engie, so I will roll.
[209:23.04]Oh, those are nice.
[209:23.72]Anybody get it?
[209:37.60]Oh, everybody safe from the chat ban.
[209:39.42]Uh, yes, get saved.
[209:46.13]Saved by 40 damage.
[210:07.66]I didn't ninja.
[210:08.86]I am an engineer.
[210:17.23]Hey, it's me, Saw.
[210:18.53]I want to play a game.
[210:19.33]Count how many rectangles are on the screen right now.
[210:27.52]A lot.
[210:28.92]It would take a while.
[210:38.41]I'll say that wasn't a great saw, by the way.
[210:40.19]I don't think you'd play the tape and he would go, hello, how many rectangles are in the room?
[210:44.63]Bye.
[210:48.59]He would start talking about how, you know, you smoked 10 packs of cigarettes a week.
[210:53.99]Cigarettes are rectangle shaped.
[210:57.66]You got to give me some of that.
[211:01.62]You must smoke every rectangle in this room.
[211:16.55]Thank you for watching.
[211:42.84]Just wait till I get Shadow Bolt.
[211:45.74]Just wait till I get the lower cast time and ruin.
[211:51.36]I love crits.
[211:52.40]Crits are like one of my favorite things in any game ever.
[211:54.01]That's why Destruction, I want to play it.
[211:56.71]He loves random crits.
[211:59.97]Arms is like that too, I think, isn't it?
[212:05.35]Yeah, I've got 5% crit just from Cruelty, which I think is Fury.
[212:13.47]and then I don't know how I get crit after that okay watch out careful in this room guys yeah this room is actually kind of scary
[212:46.07]I'll take it.
[212:50.75]Didn't I get something earlier?
[212:51.63]I swear I got something earlier.
[213:00.00]No.
[213:16.04]Ooh.
[213:21.10]We gotta pull, we gotta pull.
[213:24.26]Add.
[213:24.40]Uh-oh.
[213:27.19]What do we do?
[213:27.99]Uh, listen, Priest, I've only got 20 seconds of Power Word Fortitude left.
[213:38.75]I'm gonna need you guys to re-up that.
[213:41.94]Hey, quit joking around.
[213:43.34]We could get three of these and then I'm turning around and drinking a swift potion.
[213:54.16]What was that, uh, South Park character?
[213:55.88]Quit screwing around.
[213:57.43]You're screwing around too much.
[213:58.91]Oh, nice.
[214:09.35]It was the shop teacher, yeah.
[214:15.84]Oh, you kids are screwing around too much.
[214:17.86]I saw you trying to parse.
[214:31.81]I had to.
[214:34.90]Fuck, I pressed the wrong button.
[214:35.74]Is it over?
[215:05.17]Whoever's confused, this is D&D for nerds.
[215:11.56]This is D&D without needing to roll any dice.
[215:15.10]You never roll dice in this game.
[215:19.10]Well, it happens in the background, so you don't even know.
[215:42.98]Yeah, do you like Warrior or Shaman at this point more?
[215:47.88]At this point, hold on.
[215:50.43]He's running through the raid.
[215:52.33]Who's doing that?
[215:53.03]I think I did.
[215:57.47]Let's see, at this point, Shaman, but only because I have more moves.
[216:02.68]Because my Shaman's like level 29.
[216:10.06]But I like tanking.
[216:13.35]so I like the idea of that but I I like throwing down totems I like having a bunch of like support shit alright we can take all these guys um I don't know if it's gonna pull them all
[216:43.04]Damn, what is?
[216:44.72]Oh, this is a quest quest item for me.
[216:50.32]Oh yeah, that shield is crazy.
[216:51.60]Am I supposed to roll need on that shield?
[216:55.64]Um?
[216:57.10]I if I would say handers, I would say yeah.
[217:01.34]Priority for whoever can use it, right?
[217:05.50]Technically, shaman can.
[217:07.95]Strength though, strength down.
[217:13.12]but they're probably using staff.
[217:22.38]Boom.
[217:35.29]PB?
[217:37.51]Is it 82 or was it 92?
[217:58.27]89?
[217:58.43]Oh.
[217:58.79]Alright, this guy up here is the one that can knock us into the fire.
[218:09.74]Yeah.
[218:09.94]Do we want to clear, or are we just taking the route on the right?
[218:15.87]I don't know.
[218:18.01]I wish I knew.
[218:18.57]I never played Horde.
[218:20.05]Holly...
[218:21.99]Holly, what do we do?
[218:27.42]But we're fine.
[218:28.00]Yeah, alright.
[218:28.64]We'll go right.
[218:34.43]We do have a pat coming.
[218:35.29]I don't know if it's going to walk all the way down here, though.
[218:46.78]die in here we're gonna die in here oh no I'm getting nervous are we gonna pull this whole thing uh I could try just pulling the searing blade cultist and see what happens I mean we're getting these three is fine but getting the five of them is not it's not gonna pull all five right I don't know I'm just gonna pull the dude on the front right and
[219:14.90]just wait wait until they get all the way back until you do any damage yeah no paths come down here right I don't think so alright look I'm just gonna kill these two so that if somebody does run they don't accidentally pull two more people yeah let's let's play this smart I I don't know everything about this place so
[219:53.01]Oh wait, where's the sixth quest?
[220:02.88]There's another quest.
[220:12.46]Isn't there isn't there another RFC quest?
[220:19.52]We just completed, um, the... Oh no, there's only five.
[220:23.76]The guy lying on the ground, I think, technically, is a... I don't know if that's a quest quest.
[220:27.65]I think you just find him.
[220:34.81]Alright, well, okay.
[220:35.83]Let's go over the scenario.
[220:37.33]Let's go over the scenario.
[220:38.55]If you pull this and all five aggro, are we roaching out of here?
[220:44.21]Am I running?
[220:46.37]Or can we do it?
[220:47.09]Not initially.
[220:48.35]Are we staying and fighting?
[220:49.82]Holly is going to have a lot of mana.
[220:53.26]She can pump heals because she's been pacing, I think.
[220:58.10]Let me put it like this.
[220:58.84]The more we stall, the faster I run out of 500 bonus HP.
[221:02.59]Alright, that's true.
[221:03.31]Let's go.
[221:03.85]Whatever happens, let's fucking do it.
[221:05.19]I'm staying and fighting.
[221:05.95]We're going to win.
[221:11.15]Oh, thank God.
[221:11.89]Okay, pull them all the way back.
[221:12.81]You guys got to wait.
[221:14.35]Yeah, stop parsing.
[221:15.79]Don't parse.
[221:25.17]OK.
[221:25.77]Nice.
[221:53.19]We got a patrol coming.
[221:55.24]Good eyes.
[221:56.38]Very good eyes.
[221:58.90]Still coming.
[222:00.76]He doesn't care any... No, we got him.
[222:02.34]Okay, it's fine.
[222:04.00]Focus on the enforcer, I think, right?
[222:11.07]They keep mocking me on my ass.
[222:28.22]OK, good.
[222:32.06]Totem pulled.
[222:36.26]Is that a quest right there?
[222:41.40]Or is it somebody's winning the?
[222:48.12]It was a book loot.
[222:49.04]Yeah, what was it?
[222:49.89]Yeah, there's a book loot here.
[222:58.62]Can I get a book?
[223:04.12]Oh shit, I didn't even have this.
[223:09.27]Yeah, you're the one that hasn't looted it, apparently.
[223:15.41]You don't have the quest?
[223:16.77]I apparently didn't have it.
[223:17.55]I don't know how.
[223:17.99]I think we'll kill a few more of these anyways.
[223:23.21]Alright, well here's an enforcer.
[223:30.09]That's what I was reading in chat and I was confused.
[223:37.50]Yeah, we definitely don't want to lose Rend.
[223:39.10]Alright, so this guy can knock us into... Should we clear the other side too?
[223:47.71]Or do we just pull him back here?
[223:50.41]Well, what I have to do is just keep them away from the edge.
[223:53.07]You guys need to just, it should be pretty easy for you guys.
[223:55.84]You just stay far away from him, like your max cast range.
[224:01.76]And then I might get like knocked around.
[224:04.00]Okay.
[224:06.58]If we don't kill him fast enough, but it should be fine.
[224:09.41]Okay.
[224:10.55]Um, let's do it.
[224:25.07]Easy.
[224:25.27]Got him.
[224:52.80]Don't mind if I do.
[224:54.28]Oh yeah, that's great for you.
[224:57.20]Don't forget to pick up his heart, everyone.
[224:59.32]True.
[225:11.52]Oh, big W. Okay, now where do we go?
[225:20.08]Just the way we're facing, just pick a route, I guess.
[225:24.57]I think we just have to.
[225:25.19]Yeah, this is a scary pole.
[225:26.71]Potentially it's going to be careful.
[225:39.85]Don't attack the people behind.
[225:41.49]Holy shit dude, I almost just pulled them.
[225:48.25]Tab targeting can be so terrifying.
[225:55.47]That's good too.
[225:56.75]Basically what I'm using.
[225:57.79]This is a monster poll here.
[226:02.57]This is this is for three or four people.
[226:06.75]Polly the Voidwalker.
[226:07.63]Kill Square.
[226:21.32]Does Polly work on demons?
[226:24.00]Guess we'll find out.
[226:26.86]I'm going in
[227:00.39]Corruption.
[227:06.19]Corruption.
[227:17.76]I really do miss having instant cast corruption though.
[227:22.93]It feels it takes an eternity to get it out there now.
[227:42.37]Did you just get it?
[227:44.33]How far down is it?
[227:46.51]I guess it is right there.
[227:47.55]Alright, who are we killing first?
[227:57.08]The one on the right?
[227:58.12]Uh, Polly Moon.
[228:06.08]Okay.
[228:26.11]They don't run, do they?
[228:38.12]Same plan earlier.
[228:45.99]Might be wise to just kill these dudes on the left.
[228:49.39]yeah skipping that is okay let's skip that and go this way sure that's fine if somebody just backs up and pulls that we're all dead so
[229:23.15]Nice.
[229:24.25]Lot of weapons dropping.
[230:00.57]Somebody said anyone else have no idea what's going on.
[230:05.67]Rose never seen a health bar go down to zero before.
[230:08.08]I mean, yeah, honestly, it's just we just kill the things.
[230:12.24]On the screen, that's pretty much it.
[230:28.68]Does Warlock get a threat reduction ability?
[230:35.76]I don't think they do.
[230:39.70]They don't.
[230:40.12]Okay, you just have to actually be careful.
[230:41.38]You can't just be an asshole.
[230:42.56]It's like a five-person pool here.
[230:49.92]But also, we've only got 12 minutes on Warchief's Blessing.
[230:54.16]Yeah, we gotta kill that guy in 12 minutes, right?
[230:59.42]Don't rush.
[231:00.64]Alright, so this is a big pull.
[231:01.66]This is a big deal.
[231:02.58]So we gotta go... Should I get the Voidwalker for this?
[231:05.86]Just send him on somebody?
[231:07.06]Oh yeah, can we have health stones?
[231:10.74]Yeah, I can give you some.
[231:17.61]I don't have enough space.
[231:21.87]Delete this.
[231:24.81]Everybody has no room in their inventory.
[231:28.71]I guess nobody's getting a health stone.
[231:44.18]Your partner has... Oh, you already have one.
[231:45.56]Okay.
[231:45.78]You got room?
[231:52.93]Do you want me to bring out void Walker?
[231:56.61]I feel like that's safe.
[231:58.07]No, I'd say I'd say just poly the one on the left.
[232:00.59]I'm going to try if they get pulled and then I'm just going to try and pull on the right and see how many of these dudes pull.
[232:07.64]I've got I got some emergency things.
[232:10.00]Alright, let's do it.
[232:14.48]Burn down the skull and then just be careful.
[232:27.15]Oh, we're good.
[232:53.17]I'm surprised it didn't get everybody.
[232:56.98]Same with this one too.
[233:02.34]Must be like just out of reach.
[233:08.23]Bomb crits.
[233:25.43]Oh, I'm ripping aggro like a dumbass.
[233:30.65]That's why I got taunts.
[233:38.46]Because my pet actually, the pet pulled aggro.
[233:39.98]Did the pet crit like two or three times?
[233:50.23]Oh, there's the book finally.
[234:14.89]Resist, what?
[234:20.55]Resist, what the fuck?
[234:22.26]Ooh.
[234:22.56]Oh, dude.
[234:32.90]It's pretty good, actually.
[234:34.66]It is good.
[234:37.27]It's even got the gold border.
[234:39.23]What does it look like?
[234:40.73]Wait, that was a boss.
[234:42.45]Well, that was the boss.
[234:44.09]Shit.
[234:46.17]We didn't get to hype him up.
[234:47.89]That was a really hard fight, guys.
[234:50.41]I was really struggling there.
[234:52.17]My health sometimes dipped below 90%.
[234:53.84]Dude, imagine people coming to fight you and they don't even know you're a boss.
[235:02.77]Did we just do it?
[235:03.91]Oh, I think there's a little more.
[235:06.55]No, there's one more.
[235:07.27]Yeah, there's one more boss.
[235:08.09]That's the last boss.
[235:09.00]Alright, we gotta... We gotta move here.
[235:13.76]What'd I roll?
[235:14.20]A six?
[235:17.22]I rolled a six?
[235:18.46]Oh, come on.
[235:19.40]Alright, fair is fair.
[236:02.01]Everybody, dot him the fuck up.
[236:03.59]Dot him the fuck up.
[236:04.72]Dot him the fuck up.
[236:20.59]Oh wait, do we not need to kill these guys?
[236:26.56]We got we got seven minutes.
[236:31.02]Well, we killed them for fun.
[236:38.44]Oh.
[236:40.40]Oh, the lava.
[236:41.22]Wait, what are we doing?
[236:44.59]All these going on a shortcut.
[236:46.25]Why are we doing shortcuts now in hardcore?
[236:48.11]Do you want to kill us all?
[236:54.85]I don't make jumps like this.
[236:57.50]Alright, we're good.
[237:00.03]Holy shit, I almost walked in.
[237:26.98]The swift pot stays on the hot bar.
[237:32.52]Alright guys, we're gonna have to pause this dungeon to go back out and get an exceedant and rend.
[237:37.42]Make sure we can complete this.
[237:42.78]Everybody go to org.
[237:44.06]That would be the funniest, lamest thing to do, honestly.
[237:47.72]For RFC.
[237:58.81]Okay, we got a few.
[237:59.77]I hope this sheep doesn't wander into the other bros.
[238:08.45]Ooh, that's... Yeah, we got to kill these quick.
[238:13.32]Okay.
[238:28.28]I wish I had a Silence.
[238:29.82]Shadow Priest has Silence.
[238:30.78]I should have been a Shadow Priest.
[238:42.23]Osuccubus has Silence.
[238:43.23]I get a 20 though.
[238:50.20]Spellhunter?
[238:50.76]Did they dispel it?
[238:51.62]Spellhunter is... removes magic debuffs, right?
[238:56.09]I think it eats magic, beneficial magic spells on people.
[239:21.16]And a burn is awesome too, especially in PvP.
[239:22.88]I keep having to make room in my bag.
[239:47.20]I know, I'm about to be there too.
[239:49.02]Thankfully, we're about to be at the end of the dungeon.
[240:02.71]Yeah, I'm doing pretty well.
[240:03.95]Keep in mind guys, I sat on my ball sack like an hour ago and that's still bothering me.
[240:07.65]That's why I'm not at the top.
[240:09.45]He also got orbed today.
[240:11.67]Yeah, I got like visited by an alien spaceship last night.
[240:18.65]The last 24 hours has been very strange, okay?
[240:20.61]Sorry, I'm not on my A game right now.
[240:52.71]They're very weird.
[240:54.37]Is this the last dude?
[240:58.50]Uh, yeah, that's him.
[241:00.06]We got two minutes.
[241:01.20]Alright, we can do it.
[241:01.78]Let's get in there.
[241:02.82]We good?
[241:03.16]We got mana?
[241:03.66]Pull these guys and we'll get them.
[241:06.44]I think you can pull the right guy without pulling any of the other ones.
[241:23.06]You guys are going to have to wand.
[241:24.06]I'm going in.
[241:25.27]Alright, let's burn the one on the left.
[241:28.07]And then immediate turn to burn on the right.
[241:29.73]And then DPS.
[241:30.21]DPS.
[241:52.49]Let me see a couple of crits here.
[241:53.47]Come on.
[241:54.81]Give me a crit.
[241:56.19]Give me a big ass crit right now.
[242:00.11]Yeah.
[242:03.51]Literally no loot.
[242:05.31]There's no loot on this guy?
[242:09.31]A feeble short bow.
[242:10.55]It's gray, worth a silver and a half.
[242:12.97]Does he have a quest item?
[242:24.46]I don't think he's a quest, is he?
[242:27.62]I think he just... Yeah, he is.
[242:29.36]I think you just kill him.
[242:33.80]We did it.
[242:35.50]Hey, nice job.
[242:36.40]Hey, congratulations, everybody.
[242:37.70]We did the tutorial dungeon.
[242:40.68]We did it before Warchief's blessing ran out.
[242:44.77]We did it.
[242:45.13]We did the dungeon that is literally in one of the cities to teach you what a dungeon is.
[242:50.99]We did it.
[242:54.75]really oh that's that's cool death roll 35 silver okay come here 35 you want to start that high alright I'll go I'll go first we saw what happened uh yesterday 25 so okay fine 25
[243:29.23]Oh, that's not good.
[243:29.95]Uh-oh.
[243:33.79]Straight to 40.
[243:34.19]Uh-uh.
[243:42.48]Oh, shit.
[243:49.22]Oh!
[243:49.44]50-50.
[243:50.00]Yes!
[243:50.70]Give me the money.
[243:51.44]Give me the money.
[243:52.68]He can't lose.
[243:54.36]Give it to me.
[243:57.75]I'll take money from my own girlfriend.
[243:59.43]I don't, I don't care.
[244:01.17]Hey, we said 25, 25.
[244:03.39]What are you?
[244:09.62]That's not virtuous.
[244:10.78]That's breaking one of the seven virtues.
[244:12.30]Uh-oh.
[244:21.54]I wasn't, that was just to see if you could roll a million.
[244:26.93]I got two gold.
[244:28.25]How much money do you have?
[244:29.07]70 silver, dude.
[244:32.93]You've taken everybody's money.
[244:34.39]You've done like the take a dollar out of everybody's bank account thing.
[244:41.89]Have I taken at least 20 silver from everybody that's come near us?
[244:47.67]Alright, let's turn these all in.
[244:49.19]This is going to be at least a level.
[244:56.30]Do I have any stupid bullshit to get rid of?
[244:57.70]No, this is all important.
[245:02.61]Actually, no, these aren't, but whatever.
[245:04.65]Can you hearth or do we need to walk you out?
[245:06.41]Um, hearthing goes to the crossroads and nothing respawns, right?
[245:13.11]We'll just walk it.
[245:18.31]We're going to have to fight these dudes unless you take the shortcut back down to the right, I guess.
[245:24.45]I think everybody's still here.
[245:27.56]goes a long time for a respawn.
[245:29.80]Yeah, well, let's not die in the post dungeon.
[246:00.43]So I kind of did, you know, we did Molten Core.
[246:04.01]This is a Molten spot.
[246:05.95]It's fiery.
[246:06.95]It's a core.
[246:07.69]It's a part of Orgrimmar.
[246:08.64]It's at the core of Orgrimmar.
[246:09.86]This is where parents who are going to Molten Core drop their kids off while they're doing Molten Core.
[246:17.32]True.
[246:23.93]You tell your kid this is Molten Core because they'll come and see you playing.
[246:27.90]Like what's that?
[246:28.68]Oh look, I'm in molten core.
[246:30.25]What the hell?
[246:36.19]If you're a little kid, you will not be able to tell the difference between this and molten core.
[246:41.42]You can still fall in the lava and die though, yeah.
[246:50.72]About two hours to respond to dungeon.
[246:53.95]Guys, it's kind of poetic if you think that World of Warcraft starts and ends with a lava dungeon.
[247:04.49]We're going to do literary analysis for the next three and a half hours on the dungeons of World of Warcraft.
[247:10.78]What was the author's intent?
[247:15.90]Lots and lots of money.
[247:36.38]Alright, but do I hit 17 from this?
[247:41.84]Isn't this just the horde though?
[247:43.06]Yeah, I mean the alliance were only created so the horde would have people to kill.
[247:52.31]That was the training wheels.
[247:53.27]Wailing Caverns is the real first.
[247:55.67]I'd say dungeon.
[247:56.51]That's actually kind of scary.
[248:00.48]The last boss of Wailing Caverns has killed plenty of people.
[248:05.76]I've seen clips of it killing people.
[248:08.15]It can crit you two or three times in a row and it kills any tank.
[248:22.04]And it's got a jump.
[248:23.04]Yeah, it has a jump you have to make.
[248:26.98]It's a pain in the ass to navigate.
[248:28.40]It's all over the place.
[248:29.32]It has huge poles.
[248:37.44]And that last boss can obliterate.
[248:42.58]Any non-tank.
[248:44.26]We have a welcome party.
[248:53.75]Oh, we had some, we had some hate watchers.
[248:55.35]Okay.
[248:59.62]Chug chug.
[249:00.60]Victory.
[249:02.30]Chug chug.
[249:03.22]Where do the rest of these go?
[249:11.63]Holgrimmar, Thunder Bluff, Thunder Bluff, Undercity.
[249:16.13]We got to go all the way to the Undercity.
[249:17.31]Yes, you have to go to the whole world.
[249:23.65]Bot is pretty big XP.
[249:24.65]Yeah, this will be a lot.
[249:32.66]oh thrall okay yeah there's thrall there's two in thunder bluff and then the one in undercity
[249:59.63]really showing only fangs how to do things like we did a we did a raid draft and the raid in the same day that's true yeah we also were gonna have uh two people kill each other for a spot so and that might not be uh something to emulate I'm sure they've already done that have they I wonder if they've done something like that they almost did that
[250:28.47]Because I remember back in the, like, for the first Molten Core raid, I think it was, like, there was going to be a Makara to duel for the raid spot, but then they ended up just doing, like, a regular duel or, like, best of 10 or something.
[250:47.65]They did it for Gilded, but that was not for the death.
[250:54.51]I miss money, friend!
[250:55.85]I'm back!
[250:59.19]Welcome to Orgrimmar.
[251:01.29]Have you come to serve the Horde?
[251:03.05]Make sure you kiss the goblin.
[251:11.10]And also make sure you go back to Niru in the cave before you leave.
[251:14.54]And there's also... I don't know if you want to go to Stone Talon, but there's a Stone Talon quest here.
[251:27.69]Yeah, I grabbed it.
[251:31.92]I'm probably going to call it here too.
[251:33.02]I think it's a good place to stop up, learn a few things and get a couple things.
[251:48.40]No, yeah, that's fine.
[251:50.59]Learn a few things like crafting.
[251:52.49]Yeah, I want to do some tailoring.
[251:54.68]I want to do... I have to pick a second profession.
[251:57.92]I have to figure out what I want to do with this guy.
[252:07.48]Am I in danger still?
[252:09.83]I don't think we're in any danger anymore.
[252:11.55]Unless I somehow fall off a cliff.
[252:13.65]What were you saying, sir?
[252:24.73]I don't remember I did get confused because I didn't see the skull over your head and I was like who's the floating skull through the wall well that's worth it back to thrall okay chat so the lore of this character is
[252:56.29]Neru Fireblade is actually someone who does not have Thrall's best interest at heart, and Thrall suspects this, so he is using you, the player, to suss out who is actually on his side, and who is trying to undermine him.
[253:15.59]I'm really glad you did that, because I was not going to even attempt.
[253:18.91]Just give me the item and get complete experience points.
[253:24.41]I feel like you would listen to all the quest text if you weren't on stream.
[253:34.50]I mean, the... I feel like I've read... That's every time.
[253:39.69]It scares the shit out of me every single time.
[253:47.87]I think it's because there's all the people in the area that get it.
[253:51.23]So it hits 10 people around you and it just feels like my computer is crashing.
[254:07.10]Somebody just asked if this was the Rainforest Cafe.
[254:13.70]There are probably more variants and versions of World of Warcraft you can play now with a single subscription than there are rainforest cafes in the US.
[254:24.95]Honestly, there's probably been at least that amount of expansions.
[254:33.69]Nice.
[254:36.83]That's a lot of experience too.
[254:38.65]Alright, am I getting rid of my chocolate bar finally?
[254:44.03]I already did.
[254:44.51]Oh, bye.
[254:52.19]Bye, sweetheart.
[254:53.01]I just keep getting struck by lightning.
[255:04.50]Where's the staff?
[255:13.77]There it is.
[255:18.73]That's pretty cool looking actually.
[255:19.83]Cool.
[256:00.51]I don't think any of these are... I just want to make sure I don't get rid of anything I could use.
[256:14.41]The goal is to have 10 gold by the time I'm 30.
[256:16.31]I'm going to sell everything.
[256:34.53]Is it insanely lazy to hearthstone to?
[256:39.09]Crossroads and then go.
[256:40.29]From the crossroads.
[256:43.58]To Thunder Bluff.
[256:46.70]That whatever it.
[256:49.84]I mean, under city is the one that makes sense.
[256:51.72]Could you just go outside org?
[256:53.53]That's right.
[256:53.99]Gotta go to under city first.
[257:03.55]The next time I stream this game, I will probably be in Only Fangs.
[257:10.20]I want to get the add-on.
[257:11.26]I got to get all this stuff for it.
[257:17.18]That will probably open up being able to tap into that guild.
[257:42.71]Oh wait, hold on.
[257:53.64]I got a bunch of cloth, didn't I?
[257:56.76]Yeah, I did.
[258:14.83]I have tanked my first WoW Classic dungeon yeah no you did that that was it was good good practice yeah it's good practice I think the hardest part about warriors just like switching stances without macros like I don't really want to use very many macros
[258:44.16]Yeah, macros, I never really played with them.
[258:57.67]Yeah, it's not that the changing stances is hard.
[259:00.29]The hard part is memorizing which of your entire moveset can only be used in one stance or the other.
[259:07.95]And then managing your rage at the same time.
[259:12.80]Yeah, you end up having to.
[259:15.21]You get the multiple bars, right?
[259:16.57]You press the button and you have a whole new hotbar, right?
[259:19.61]Yeah, you can like change the the moves based on which one you're in, which stance you're in.
[259:28.06]When do you get berserker stance 30?
[259:36.44]I have no idea.
[259:38.28]Speak.
[259:40.78]Red.
[259:42.98]What do you need?
[259:54.75]Yeah, whaling caverns.
[259:56.01]That's the next one.
[260:00.33]Whaling caverns.
[260:02.88]Does anybody in Only Fangs have characters that are in, like, the low 20s?
[260:08.44]I'd have to go look or see.
[260:12.07]I'm sure everybody has alts, but I don't know how many people are still playing after MC and BWO.
[260:20.01]Yeah, I mean, especially when people die.
[260:23.99]Right.
[260:24.46]There's a lot of people re-rolling and going back up through the ranks.
[260:34.28]Is that better?
[260:45.15]No.
[260:46.49]Maybe, actually it is.
[260:53.61]Those are better too.
[260:59.25]Two intellect is always going to be better than armor, right?
[261:06.36]Oh yeah.
[261:08.78]You shouldn't be building around armor.
[261:14.26]Make those right now.
[261:18.60]Oh, I can't yet, alright.
[261:20.87]Well, I'm ready for it next time.
[261:25.33]Just don't get hit exactly.
[261:27.15]It's just like every video game.
[261:28.43]Super Mario taught us all that.
[261:31.65]Jump on people's heads and don't get hit.
[261:34.88]Three times.
[261:51.04]Alright, I'm going to drop group and just head to do some of these.
[261:54.89]I'm going to Undercity right now.
[261:56.31]There hasn't been a whole lot of head jumping in games lately.
[262:11.04]Yeah, honestly, I feel like lately jumping on heads in games hurts you.
[262:18.20]They got rid of that.
[262:18.74]That was a core concept.
[262:20.90]That was, like, in the Ten Commandments of video games.
[262:23.89]Now, not anymore, apparently.
[262:24.93]There's not really, like, a lot of platformers getting made, except for, like, the OGs.
[262:38.68]Yeah.
[262:39.02]Like, when are they going to make Rayman again?
[262:40.74]That last Rayman was pretty good, wasn't it?
[262:47.04]Wasn't that, like, 2000 and, like, 14?
[262:48.40]Was it Rayman Legends?
[262:57.19]Listen, I really wish that they would make, like, a new platformer and that people would respect and recognize it enough to give it, like, Game of the Year or something.
[263:03.21]Like, I really want to see another, like, goaded platformer actually get the respect it deserves.
[263:09.53]But Astro Bot wasn't... Isn't Astro Bot that...
[263:17.37]They made a video game about the baseball team?
[263:19.75]Yeah.
[263:23.12]There was that, yeah, Astro Bot, right?
[263:25.50]They remade or they made a game based on the tutorial game that was in the PS5 and it won game of the year.
[263:37.20]Okay, I'm going to have to do like an exclamation point.
[263:41.90]Exclamation point, what's wrong with him?
[263:45.16]It's going to explain.
[263:47.84]My UI scale is huge.
[263:49.87]I'm playing 20 feet away from the monitor.
[263:54.35]I've got to have to have like a... This guy's an idiot, but here's why.
[263:58.59]Alright, we're going to assess the damage.
[264:04.63]Let's see.
[264:09.52]Okay.
[264:12.18]I'm okay with this.
[264:12.80]That's fine.
[264:15.57]I'll scale into this.
[264:16.39]Yeah, I thought you meant like exclamation.
[264:31.48]What's wrong with him for me?
[264:34.52]Oh no, I keep looking over here and people every I'd say two to three minutes.
[264:39.72]There is somebody comes in and says this UI is awful.
[264:43.23]What's wrong with him?
[264:44.61]I was going to say, there's no way you're going to fit all that into a single paragraph command.
[264:51.08]It's going to need a Google Doc.
[264:53.00]Yeah, there's a lot more going on there.
[264:56.52]You're about to get on the wrong Zeppelin, by the way.
[264:58.58]What?
[264:59.08]Oh.
[265:01.32]What's wrong with this guy?
[265:14.03]Did you say I feel like this is naked?
[265:16.59]I feel like this is the this is I am naked right now.
[265:19.71]I don't want anyone to see this.
[265:35.70]It does kind of expose you.
[265:37.01]Yeah, I don't know.
[265:38.03]I'm I gotta get better.
[265:39.53]I gotta get my rotation down.
[266:00.71]This is a group wiper AI UI.
[266:07.31]Hey, I was number one on the meter at the last boss.
[266:11.28]I was 27 DPS.
[266:15.38]That was crazy.
[266:16.18]That was huge damage.
[266:18.58]And people should be afraid of me if they are on my bad side in a dungeon.
[266:29.53]It's cool that all the people you're sitting next to and yourself just went to the Thrall gift shop and got that sweet, sweet staff.
[266:37.58]Yeah, everybody does have this thing.
[266:51.47]He's got a lot of these to give out, huh?
[266:53.15]Do you think he's just lying?
[266:54.83]Are we certain that there's even more intellect on this?
[266:58.63]Or does he sign them and give it to us?
[267:00.56]It's like it's going to like a convention to meet somebody at Comic-Con.
[267:04.60]Okay, do you think he actually signs it or do you think it's his printed signature?
[267:09.58]It's printed for sure.
[267:10.38]He's got way too much shit to do.
[267:21.95]These are drop shipped Teemu staves.
[267:25.75]Yeah, he gets them all in and then he, he prints Thrall with a, like a, a heart on it or something.
[267:35.11]And then it's like a, he writes one of those little things that's when you go meet a celebrity and they sign the photo of themselves.
[267:41.94]For David.
[267:43.94]Keep those grades up.
[267:46.92]Thrall.
[268:13.74]love the tauren dance uh the the mc I love the the raise the roof that's my favorite part come on do it
[268:45.63]When are they going to add like microtransaction emotes that I can buy for Classic?
[268:52.19]What was that?
[268:56.38]My brain was occupied for a second.
[268:58.76]What did you say?
[269:00.38]I said, when are they going to add microtransaction emotes I can buy into Classic?
[269:07.38]Just open up retail.
[269:09.38]Anything you could possibly imagine is there.
[269:14.47]They have boosts, they have transfers, they've got change your character's... I don't know, you probably can change your character's hair.
[269:24.80]They've got mounts and toys and pets and... There's a whole shop that you can go into in retail.
[270:26.78]I was going to write, don't be cute.
[270:34.91]There is respeccing in classic.
[270:36.41]Actually, I think in the anniversary servers, they added dual specs.
[270:43.08]So you actually can have two.
[270:59.47]It's level 40.
[271:02.41]What else did they put in the anniversary servers besides that?
[271:05.35]There's something else too.
[271:06.15]Something pretty major.
[271:20.49]More debuff slots.
[271:21.31]Oh, they removed the debuff slots.
[271:27.15]That's a huge deal.
[271:34.12]It was 16 slots, right?
[271:36.62]Wow, OK.
[271:39.14]I did not even I didn't know that.
[271:41.38]I thought they were still 16 or was it 16 or 32?
[272:04.06]I think they survived.
[272:13.20]Yeah, I remember because certain classes couldn't do certain moves.
[272:18.03]Like for instance, a warlock.
[272:22.25]All of my dots would be debuffs.
[272:28.61]So would an affliction warlock have trouble finding a raid spot?
[272:36.06]Or is there enough for there to be all the warlock dots?
[272:45.35]Used to.
[272:45.77]Damn.
[272:46.10]Yeah, I completely forgot about that.
[273:03.09]The Taco Bell big box just got here.
[273:05.38]Don't leave.
[273:06.04]I feel like in the time it's going to take me to do these things, you're going to eat the whole Taco Bell big box.
[273:35.42]That's the third time he sent that.
[273:39.35]Oh, so he's okay.
[273:41.35]The food got cold.
[273:52.13]Where's the turn in?
[273:53.68]Oh, it's all it's Sylvanas.
[273:58.27]Everybody wanted to see Sylvanas.
[273:59.55]Everyone was begging me to go into the Sylvanas' war room, whatever it is here.
[274:05.53]Here you go. ...
[274:47.78]It's kind of a walk to get here too.
[275:19.60]Hey yo, did he talk about a weird orange sphere at all today?
[275:22.61]I bought a costume and snuck into his room last night to mess with him.
[275:28.54]What a prick.
[275:47.84]What are we if not slaves to this torment?
[275:52.80]We are forsaken.
[275:54.62]We will slaughter anyone who stands in our way.
[276:02.91]Yes, we will do it.
[276:07.25]Everybody is the main character.
[276:08.65]I got this from the gift shop.
[276:14.01]That's such a funny way to put that.
[276:18.80]I look like this squirrely advisor that leans over and whispers in her ear.
[276:26.16]And then she casts judgment on somebody.
[276:43.14]You think you can match the might of a dreadlord?
[276:49.02]Very nice.
[276:52.52]Shitload of experience too.
[276:53.64]Oh, he's got red trimming on them.
[277:06.49]I think that's everything I can do here.
[277:15.43]Oh my god.
[277:16.39]I've been muted and deafened this whole time.
[277:20.82]welcome back everybody I must have I oh I must have pressed the okay I pressed period when did I press period uh I think it was like before you got on the zeppelin I I think I went like I just assumed you were thanking the 300 subs from earlier oh well oops
[277:50.84]I was wondering, I was like, oh, I feel like he would have had something to say about that.
[278:00.78]Wait, what is that one?
[278:01.46]I don't want to come back to this piece of shit again for a while.
[278:08.08]Level 26, eh, whatever, I don't care.
[278:14.06]I'm on my way to Thunder Bluff for the last two turn-ins.
[280:13.65]Uh... 45 seconds ago?
[280:18.75]We talked about the orb too much, man.
[280:25.24]They're trying to cut you off.
[280:29.96]Oh, they can't even hear me.
[280:32.24]What the hell is going on?
[280:36.38]Alright, that actually is weird because why would I be muted?
[280:39.40]I was just talking and my OBS just closed.
[280:42.79]What do you need?
[280:45.45]And they can't hear you either.
[280:49.52]I think they could.
[280:50.14]Yeah, they can hear me now.
[280:56.88]Could they hear me?
[280:58.06]Was like I took over the stream.
[281:00.20]I think they can hear you, yeah.
[281:09.08]Did the stream actually go down or is it doing the not like this disconnected thing?
[281:12.97]It was like the, not like this.
[281:15.87]Weird.
[281:33.17]It don't piss the orb off again.
[281:36.42]Well, I mean, we're at the end of the stream anyways.
[281:37.72]I'm just cleaning this up on stream because I would like to stream 99% of everything this character does.
[281:45.38]That's fun.
[281:47.02]Yeah, you either do all the turn-ins across the globe now or you do them later.
[281:55.39]And the XP is pretty juiced.
[281:57.39]And you're almost to 17.
[281:58.41]Yeah.
[282:15.11]Yeah, I opened up somebody's mail and then my computer crashed.
[282:28.78]If you do join Only Fangs, you need to stream 100% of when your character is online.
[282:33.84]Well, that's not true.
[282:34.90]Yeah, isn't the rule that you just have to be recording a dungeon or something in case?
[282:39.98]Yeah, the rule is you have to have a clip if you die.
[282:44.02]Okay.
[282:45.49]So as long as you can produce a clip.
[283:08.93]As if you'd make a video or a clip, I would adhere to that.
[283:11.35]I would follow the rules.
[283:14.20]would just have um what shadow play or something or just have something on that was capturing the last minute or two
[283:49.57]The Adventures of Chaos Chris.
[283:53.21]Does this kill you?
[283:54.85]Not a chance in it.
[283:55.67]Alright, where are these turn ins?
[284:04.16]Elder Rise.
[284:05.40]Yeah, I think it's Elder Rise.
[284:25.28]Getting close to getting the succubus.
[284:48.63]Oh, there he is.
[284:49.57]Hello.
[284:53.32]What bring passionately late ancestors watch over you.
[284:58.46]Very good.
[285:01.46]Go in peace.
[285:02.82]Ancestors watch over you.
[285:05.13]Yes.
[285:07.83]Nice.
[285:09.03]Just barely.
[285:16.08]Bless.
[285:16.74]Oh, shadow burn coming up.
[285:20.81]I love shadow burn.
[285:21.81]Alright, so shadow burn is one of those you do.
[285:23.61]You sneak it in with the global cooldown.
[285:26.58]And you do like a shadow bolt and then you do shadow burn immediately when you get the cast bar up and it just does a it just does 100 damage in a instantly in one second.
[285:37.80]I don't care about the whole cast again.
[285:39.88]Who cares about that?
[285:40.80]I'd use it for damage because I'm a weirdo.
[285:56.19]2.5 seconds, good.
[286:00.75]Yeah, that's the next thing I'm getting.
[286:03.15]Then, I gotta plan this out here for a second.
[286:05.45]5 in Bane.
[286:08.11]1 in Shadowburn.
[286:11.81]Then... Devastation, because that's just 5% more crit.
[286:20.14]I don't think these are that necessary.
[286:22.44]If you're trying just to go right down to ruin.
[286:30.72]A full second off of the Imp Firebolt, though.
[286:45.00]Imp runs out of mana, quick.
[286:50.14]Well, at least I know I'm doing five.
[286:51.38]I mean, this is just... Five here, five here, one.
[286:55.28]Then I would unlock this.
[287:02.53]Definitely more range.
[287:06.57]I can completely avoid these because it's hardcore and casting Hellfire in hardcore is probably the worst thing you could possibly do in a dungeon.
[287:24.53]Stunning doesn't really... I don't really care about that.
[287:29.54]this though I don't think people typically take this but if I want to do fire I feel like this would be fun to do that's 10 more credit on searing pain Holly posted a clip for you in the chat a clip what is it hold on who is Jerma
[288:12.35]Yeah, I'd probably have that reaction too.
[288:21.96]Hey, are you going to feel bad when you inevitably get a few group members killed?
[288:27.44]Stop casting bad spells at me that I'm going to kill people in the guild or something.
[288:33.73]Stop making that... You're creating an environment where that will happen.
[288:45.18]hey hey hey orb crush that guy hey I don't hey don't think you want to mess with me right now I got visited by a flaming orb last night and it I don't don't hey don't mess with me have you tried to like move anything telekinetically yet not yet I might try it though when you were a kid did you ever think maybe I actually have powers
[289:14.90]And I just haven't unleashed them yet.
[289:17.82]Yeah.
[289:21.84]I think all kids at some point squint their eyes hard and try to like scooch their papers on their desk.
[289:35.82]Alright.
[289:36.06]That's going to be it though.
[289:38.44]Uh, 17.
[289:39.02]Very good.
[289:40.44]Good dungeon.
[289:41.38]Good games.
[289:45.13]And yeah, to Alex, I am ready to play again whenever you want.
[289:50.23]I would say probably not in the next couple of days.
[289:53.45]I also want to play Monster Hunter Wilds.
[289:57.07]I know there's like five or six people that want to play it.
[290:00.25]Yeah, there's actually like shit coming out now, which is cool.
[290:03.05]Yeah.
[290:04.84]So there's a lot of random stuff to play and do.
[290:07.16]So yeah.
[290:11.74]But yeah, there's also Steam Next Fest, I think.
[290:16.42]A lot of random demos and shit.
[290:20.57]Ooh, that's good.
[290:21.79]That's good to know.
[290:24.55]Yeah, I'll see you guys in probably a few days at least.
[290:27.33]Probably at least three or four days.
[290:30.99]And I've been trying to get Jerma to play The Isle.
[290:35.02]Oh, that's right.
[290:35.50]Yeah, that'd be fun.
[290:36.40]That's the 100-person dinosaur game.
[290:45.02]Yeah, thanks for playing, dude.
[290:46.22]Good tanking.
[290:47.73]I'm sure we'll do it again.
[290:51.41]It was fun.
[290:52.65]Awesome experience tanking my first dungeon.
[290:55.31]Thanks, Holly, for healing.
[290:58.51]And DPS for, you know, not pulling aggro.
[291:03.15]I did once or twice, but it's okay.
[291:04.19]It was a learning experience.
[291:07.31]Alright, dude.
[291:07.69]I'll talk to you soon.
[291:09.49]Bye, chat.
[291:13.25]And then Otto wants to go outside.
[291:14.68]Do you want to go outside?
[291:15.96]Yes, you do.
[291:16.34]Okay.
[291:18.64]I'll see you guys later.
[291:19.24]You want to go?
[291:23.37]Yes.
[291:26.87]Thanks for watching.
[291:27.49]Thanks for hanging out.
[291:28.11]We did the first dungeon completed.
[291:40.07]Yeah, it's fun.
[291:40.83]Wow has been fun.
[291:41.49]I've been having a good time with it.
[291:42.91]So you'll see more of it.
[291:44.87]I don't know exactly when, but I probably will be in the guild.
[291:52.17]And then maybe we'll play some with some other streamers or something.
[291:55.26]I don't know.
[291:56.42]I'm down for whatever.
[291:58.54]Monster Hunter Wilds absolutely is guaranteed to be there.
[292:02.02]So you will see that.
[292:09.84]Yeah, WoW is a good game to chill and talk and just kind of go over whatever.
[292:12.51]Hang out.
[292:14.61]But having a good time.
[292:15.23]Hopefully it's been fun to watch.
[292:18.55]If not, maybe something you can just relax to.
[292:21.17]Or maybe you just don't want to watch at all and that's fine too.
[292:29.59]See you next month.
[292:41.31]Ready to go?
[292:42.01]Alright, let's go.
[292:44.19]This tail is just like, it's like a windshield wiper.
[292:52.54]Wow, retirement arc.
[292:53.69]This is what happens to all of us.
[292:57.71]We say we're retired and then we go play World of Warcraft.
[293:06.02]Yes, Nancy Drew will be finished before the Monster Hunter Wilds stream.
[293:11.92]There you go.
[293:13.52]There is your official 100% guarantee it will happen.
[293:24.29]It might even happen on the same day.
[293:26.25]I just might do it first and start earlier.
[293:33.27]I have maybe 30 or 40 minutes left in that game, so I'm just going to finish it.
[293:37.29]Alright.
[293:46.70]See you guys later.
[293:49.54]Have a good rest of your week.
[293:52.31]And call your mother.
[293:53.29]You know the whole deal.
[293:54.65]See you soon.
[293:55.13]Take care.
[293:56.59]Ta-ta.
