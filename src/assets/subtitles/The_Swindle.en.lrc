[00:29.33]Shh don't don't tell anybody Don't tell anybody I'm streaming don't tell anybody I'm streaming the swindle
[00:40.73]What's going on, guys?
[00:49.08]Yeah, it's one of those once-a-year Jerma streams.
[00:54.24]Sometimes they happen.
[00:59.93]I'm not going to be streaming for very long.
[01:05.65]Feel free, if you're sleeping, to go ahead and sleep.
[01:08.97]I'm just going to be playing the Swindle.
[01:16.06]Hey, good morning, anybody.
[01:17.12]Good morning if you're just joining us from the realm of sleep.
[01:26.91]Just making sure we're live because I never do this.
[01:29.45]I haven't done it in a long time.
[01:42.78]Get the camera.
[01:43.46]Get the camera.
[01:46.53]Since I like don't have like I have like one mod I'm gonna go ahead and do this.
[01:53.33]Oh Wait, the room was already in slow mode.
[01:55.27]What?
[01:56.81]Well, there we go.
[01:58.91]Okay Yeah, this is gonna be a very short stream so Don't worry We're just testing some things Just doing some tests
[02:18.85]Making sure I can actually stream and actually, you know, do things.
[02:22.63]Here we go.
[02:22.93]I don't know if any of you guys have played this game.
[02:27.40]If you haven't, you haven't.
[02:28.28]If you have, you have.
[02:29.22]Cool.
[02:30.34]But it seems pretty interesting.
[02:32.12]I've played like maybe 40 minutes of it, half an hour of it.
[02:35.98]Oh, hey, there's Mute.
[02:37.74]Hey, Mute.
[02:41.73]Look, Mute, I told you I was going to stream one day.
[02:46.30]So if you're wondering what this game is, what the swindle is, it's a game where you steal shit.
[02:51.98]Specifically money, cash.
[02:54.66]My voice is quiet?
[02:56.32]Uh-oh.
[02:57.64]What a terrible stream.
[02:59.14]Let me see if I can fix that.
[03:02.76]Let me just see if I can fix that real quick.
[03:08.90]Uh.
[03:11.44]Uh.
[03:12.60]No.
[03:13.34]Uh.
[03:14.58]That's not right.
[03:17.83]I guess it is.
[03:18.39]Okay, hold on.
[03:22.73]Yeah, this is like the bear with me stream while I figure out how to be a live streamer.
[03:36.96]Hold on.
[03:37.36]I did that.
[03:50.00]I mean, that's... I'm going to have to figure out how to do it as time goes.
[03:54.98]Unless... Maybe I did something in my software.
[03:57.82]Hold on.
[03:59.20]Hold on a second.
[04:11.75]Hmm.
[04:12.68]Okay.
[04:13.22]Well, there's that.
[04:17.61]Okay, tell me if this, like, breaks everything.
[04:19.51]Hopefully it doesn't.
[04:21.90]We're gonna go with, like, a boost.
[04:25.68]Okay, I just- I just did a boost.
[04:28.54]How bad does this sound?
[04:29.60]Does this- I'm sorry.
[04:59.47]Was that, was that too loud?
[05:00.67]That wasn't too loud?
[05:01.47]Hold on, I'm gonna hear what this sounds like.
[05:06.09]This might sound real bad.
[05:07.05]Why can I not hear it?
[05:12.71]Come on.
[05:15.79]No, pretty sick boost.
[05:42.95]How about this?
[05:43.84]Better?
[05:45.22]Better?
[05:45.48]Worse?
[05:45.90]More of the same?
[05:47.50]So lower?
[05:48.24]Remember, this is like the test stream.
[05:53.02]So don't expect a real stream here, guys.
[05:55.30]I apologize.
[05:55.96]There's like 300 people here right now.
[05:58.78]This was just supposed to be like, I try to get my settings correct.
[06:09.74]And then we can play some Swindle for, I don't know, maybe like 10 minutes.
[06:15.65]Okay, let's see.
[06:16.65]I'm sure people will tell me in the chat how bad that is.
[06:21.57]Regardless of the game audio, are we good?
[06:24.37]Is it better?
[06:25.29]Worse?
[06:26.83]Maybe a pinch too quiet?
[06:28.01]Well, it's something I'm going to have to figure out.
[06:30.95]I'll figure it out eventually.
[06:33.26]Anyways, let's steal some stuff for like 10 minutes.
[06:38.03]So, this window, you have a little workbench here, where you get to look at your stuff, and you get to see the various upgrades you can do.
[06:44.22]There's different agility tools, you know, who gives a shit?
[06:49.08]Let's just go take money from somebody, and when it's not ours, we take it.
[06:53.40]I believe it's randomly generated heists, where you kind of go in and play, and you break in, and you steal stuff.
[06:58.36]It's pretty fun.
[06:59.80]I haven't played very much of it, but I'm going to play some right now.
[07:04.82]I haven't gotten very far at all.
[07:06.58]As you can see, I think you start at 90 days, and we're at 85.
[07:09.78]And they have the little robots over there, they can see, there's their, like, their Metal Gear Solid We Can See You thing.
[07:20.84]There's a mine right there, hopefully it doesn't blow up and kill me.
[07:25.90]Actually, can I even go by this?
[07:29.08]Oh, I can hack the mine, right.
[07:30.51]Okay, that's fine.
[07:33.35]Oh, fuck, I didn't press the button.
[07:35.66]I was looking over at the chat.
[07:37.42]I almost, like, blew myself up.
[07:38.62]So this is my mine now?
[07:39.68]Is that how it works?
[07:41.56]I think?
[07:43.34]I guess it's my mine.
[07:44.24]So maybe if I open the door and these guys come through, they'll explode?
[07:48.17]Right?
[07:48.63]Theoretically?
[07:51.05]Beautiful.
[07:52.61]Absolutely beautiful.
[07:54.87]Now, these are little bots.
[07:56.15]You're gonna steal the money.
[07:57.47]You don't want these guys to see you, so you whack them with your cane.
[08:02.70]And then you fall down here and you just jump around.
[08:05.86]You know, so get off your seat and jump around.
[08:10.78]You can actually die.
[08:11.36]One thing I have noticed in this game is if you fall from what seems to be not that high of a height, it does kill you instantly.
[08:17.61]That's something you have to be careful of.
[08:18.69]But let's stop talking and let's just play.
[08:20.65]Oh, fuck.
[08:21.65]Okay.
[08:22.85]Turns out that wasn't a good idea.
[08:25.71]And if you've been spotted, like I just have, you lose... This is like they run the alarms and shit, and now everyone knows where I am, so... It only takes so much money.
[08:40.63]Caught by that guy.
[08:43.57]What am I, what the hell am I doing?
[08:44.77]What am I talking about?
[08:45.37]I've already been, like, spotted.
[08:47.51]Just hack, take as much money as I can get and get the hell out of here.
[08:50.64]What am I so concerned about?
[08:51.68]I've already lost too much money.
[08:56.06]And just for good measure, we're gonna fucking murder these people.
[08:59.06]That's, alright, I'm fine.
[09:03.15]There's money that lies around the ground, too, and I believe, like, you're supposed to do it faster, and that's another mine.
[09:09.35]And then the bobbies show up.
[09:12.19]If you've been spotted and they start looking for you, maybe I can... Ooh, it even slow-moded for me.
[09:20.50]I really fucked that up, huh?
[09:22.30]Break the glass.
[09:26.26]Yeah, I gotta get used to, like, playing a video game.
[09:32.06]What I was going to say is I gotta get used to playing a video game and, like, talking and paying attention.
[09:35.80]It's been a while since I've done this.
[09:39.51]Yeah, I'm not used to, like, just gaming, you know what I mean?
[09:44.07]Alright, we're gonna be... I lost everything, by the way.
[09:45.87]If you die in a level, it's all gone.
[09:47.54]So... And now I lost a day, as you can see.
[09:50.98]I have 84 days remaining to, like, win, beat the game, essentially.
[09:56.39]Like, shit, you know?
[09:58.23]You know, it is what it is.
[10:01.12]It's time to, like, concentrate.
[10:02.86]Okay.
[10:03.36]You guys know the deal.
[10:04.38]I have a different character now.
[10:05.59]You use randomly generated characters.
[10:06.95]Let's just go ahead and beat this level.
[10:08.99]Watch it, pro.
[10:17.01]I thought that was gonna... I thought I was gonna... Hold on a second.
[10:20.87]Hold on a second.
[10:21.51]Test stream!
[10:22.29]Hey, this is what we... This is a test stream, remember?
[10:24.46]Let me show you how a fucking pro does it.
[10:28.10]Test stream my ass.
[10:39.20]See, now I actually do have to rush because there's no money up there.
[10:42.00]Forget it.
[10:42.32]Because when you get spotted, you actually do have to get the hell out of here.
[10:51.22]Is there money in there?
[10:51.80]There is money in there.
[10:55.64]Oh, he's alive still.
[11:00.64]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[11:05.01]So how's the actual stream going, by the way?
[11:08.53]Is it lagging?
[11:09.39]How does it look?
[11:11.88]Are we clear?
[11:12.98]Are we crystal clear?
[11:16.56]Okay, this is... This room down here is gonna be a real pain in the ass.
[11:19.66]And the bobbies are coming, I think, so I gotta go.
[11:21.30]You know what, we're just gonna go.
[11:23.75]We're just gonna leave.
[11:24.45]We're just gonna leave right now.
[11:25.93]I don't know if I can exit this way.
[11:28.49]I'm gonna find out.
[11:30.71]Nope, can't go that way.
[11:31.59]I gotta go back to the beginning.
[11:33.11]I hope I don't get shot by, like, a laser.
[11:37.41]Gotta go all the way around.
[11:39.47]Because, like I said, if you die, you... I almost just forgot about that fucking thing.
[11:47.86]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:50.14]Get me out, get me out.
[11:51.08]Get me out of here!
[11:54.52]I almost fucking died.
[11:57.76]Alright, let's go after the airship.
[12:00.76]I have some money.
[12:03.44]I, like, played this game a little bit.
[12:07.24]And I was doing okay.
[12:10.38]And then I do my little stream.
[12:12.94]And shit.
[12:15.18]Can I buy anything?
[12:15.70]I wonder if I can buy something new.
[12:17.01]An upgrade or something.
[12:19.13]But the point is, you get to go to higher places that are a bunch more difficult.
[12:24.55]And this is not very hard.
[12:25.57]I'm not at like the hard part of the game right now.
[12:27.65]This is like the easy mode.
[12:28.65]I just beat the tutorial like 20 minutes ago.
[12:33.05]You can get like triple jumps, I think.
[12:34.41]Yeah, two extra jumps.
[12:36.35]$40,000.
[12:36.41]Holy shit, I don't have that kind of money.
[12:38.84]I got $3,800.
[12:39.06]$400.
[12:39.10]Do I already have that?
[12:43.78]Movement speed level 1.
[12:44.48]Oh, hell yeah.
[12:46.38]Hell yeah, definitely.
[12:47.12]That's $400.
[12:47.64]Is there like a level 2 for that?
[12:50.93]No, it's just a level 1 right now.
[12:54.73]Maybe I should steal a game shark.
[12:55.97]Yeah, maybe I should get a game shark.
[12:58.97]Wall jumping.
[12:59.65]Stop mid-slide on any wall.
[13:01.49]That sounds pretty useful.
[13:04.86]Gonna buy that.
[13:05.50]2400 bucks.
[13:08.16]What else can I do?
[13:12.48]Uh, this is a hack, I believe.
[13:14.82]Make your hacks a little bit better.
[13:18.98]$3000 hacks.
[13:19.34]Your thief's increased hacking abilities allow them to open locked doors.
[13:24.99]Um... I already have this one.
[13:30.45]Shoe on head, oh prude.
[13:33.29]Shoe's on my fucking head.
[13:35.31]Yeah.
[13:36.84]Told you.
[13:39.34]I told you, you didn't believe me.
[13:41.76]Bionic eyes.
[13:45.10]Hold on, so that's like the look down, you can see that.
[13:47.00]I need that, that's a huge deal.
[13:48.16]I don't have very much money, tools.
[13:56.95]Goggles, missile... I don't have enough for anything.
[13:58.97]I don't even know what the hell this stuff is.
[14:00.70]We're just gonna actually try to do a heist and not get shit on like I've been the last, like, three times.
[14:08.40]See down here?
[14:09.92]These are, like, the hard areas.
[14:11.48]Like, this is the real swindle down here.
[14:13.30]See number five?
[14:13.90]That's, like, the swindle.
[14:17.11]I'm in the slums right now.
[14:18.17]I'm not even close to the swindle.
[14:20.63]And I only have 82 days left.
[14:23.88]Alright, I'm going to legit concentrate for this one.
[14:26.28]We'll see how I do.
[14:29.30]Yeah, you can like see.
[14:30.44]I just upgraded to get this.
[14:34.20]That's like a pretty key point of the game.
[14:35.60]Alright, let's go.
[14:36.74]I'm going to go up top.
[14:45.67]Is there any money in there?
[14:46.97]I don't think so.
[14:52.84]I can stick to walls now too, right?
[14:55.58]How do I do that?
[14:57.52]Do I just hold the button?
[15:00.26]Maybe it just meant I can actually stick to the walls.
[15:04.38]Okay.
[15:09.41]Some cash over there.
[15:10.29]Oh, there we go.
[15:14.49]Okay, you have to hold up while you're on the wall.
[15:17.31]That's extremely useful.
[15:18.39]I'm so glad I have that.
[15:19.33]That was worth like a hundred bucks.
[15:22.30]This is going to be tricky, though, because how do I do this without being spotted?
[15:25.56]I have to wait until these two guys come by.
[15:27.04]That guy's got a much longer range.
[15:30.56]I'm going to drop down in three, two, one.
[15:33.20]Okay, I got one.
[15:39.73]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[15:40.41]Easy.
[15:41.67]Easy.
[15:45.86]Wow, that was really close.
[15:47.68]That's a security camera.
[15:48.84]I didn't even see that.
[15:50.52]I thought that was the other guy that's right here.
[15:53.26]So we... Fuck.
[15:57.77]We're just gonna chill.
[16:00.65]What's a good opportunity to go?
[16:01.61]Like right now?
[16:03.11]Yeah, like right now.
[16:06.97]Can I not destroy this?
[16:07.85]I can't take out the security cameras.
[16:08.99]Okay, good to know.
[16:10.41]I got the money though.
[16:11.17]That's all that matters.
[16:15.49]Gonna wait till this guy comes back.
[16:16.67]Is there any more money on this side?
[16:22.28]Don't think so.
[16:24.14]We're gonna keep going.
[16:25.64]Can I keep going?
[16:26.14]I have to go up and around, right?
[16:27.16]Yeah, I gotta go up and around.
[16:34.19]Let's move.
[16:38.09]Nobody spotted me.
[16:39.61]Can get in and get out.
[16:42.59]Mine here.
[16:43.11]I could activate that mine and it could blow up.
[16:47.52]What the hell am I doing?
[16:54.95]I guess that doesn't alert the police when a mine blows up in the building they're watching.
[17:00.19]Okay.
[17:02.19]Oh, fuck me.
[17:04.57]Yeah, I blew up the terminal where you get the money from, unfortunately.
[17:10.95]I actually didn't know you could do that, so now I know.
[17:14.51]Do not blow up mines near the terminals.
[17:20.31]Wait for this guy to come down.
[17:23.89]Actually, I'm pretty clear here.
[17:26.39]Gotta hit these guys twice.
[17:30.11]And hack the computer!
[17:36.92]$623.
[17:36.94]One of these times I'm gonna fuck this up and it's gonna be really bad.
[17:49.88]There can't be very much money in here that's left.
[17:53.20]In fact, I think I got it all.
[17:54.28]I got it all, right?
[17:56.08]It tells you at the end of the level how much money you missed.
[17:59.42]It's kind of like when you're playing Man vs. Machine and you miss, like, the 10 bucks and you want to, like, scream.
[18:05.75]It tells you that.
[18:07.75]I'm pretty sure I got it all, though, right?
[18:10.67]Did I miss any?
[18:14.21]Yeah, the sound is pretty good in this game.
[18:15.99]It is very, very interesting.
[18:19.33]I think that's it.
[18:20.21]I'm gonna say that's it.
[18:21.07]I didn't find out.
[18:22.05]Did I find out?
[18:22.63]Oh, well, of course I lost the money from the... Yeah, the other 50% was inside the other box that I couldn't open because I blew it up.
[18:33.44]Oh, let's do another one.
[18:39.82]I got an info bubble.
[18:42.17]Hold up or away.
[18:43.21]Oh, that's just telling me the thing that I already knew.
[18:49.43]Oh, I can't go through the ceiling unless I break... Jesus, that's a lot of people coming over here.
[18:53.03]Please don't tell me they can drop down.
[18:54.03]Do they drop down?
[18:55.01]No, they don't.
[18:55.41]Alright.
[19:07.22]As long as I'm patient, I'll be able to do this pretty easily.
[19:10.64]But I don't have very much patience, unfortunately.
[19:16.76]I should have went.
[19:17.48]I could have killed that robot right there, but I didn't.
[19:26.31]Now I can go.
[19:29.48]Jump for the camera.
[19:34.54]Come on.
[19:36.22]Ooh, I just realized something.
[19:37.30]Hacking this is gonna be very difficult.
[19:39.88]I gotta go around the other side.
[19:41.84]There's no way... Yeah, I gotta go around.
[19:43.42]I will be spotted.
[19:44.06]That guy... That robot and the camera... I don't wanna be on fucking camera, you know what I mean?
[19:48.77]Don't take my picture.
[19:49.45]I don't wanna be on camera.
[19:51.89]I gotta go around.
[19:53.55]See?
[19:53.79]That's how they're trying to trick you.
[20:02.14]I'm gonna go all the way around just to make sure there's no other thing that's down here that I can do.
[20:07.21]But I can activate that.
[20:08.29]I'll just do that.
[20:12.09]What just, what happened?
[20:13.92]What happened?
[20:14.76]I did it right.
[20:16.76]I did that correctly.
[20:17.56]I did that right.
[20:18.22]I... Was it left or was it... Shit.
[20:26.40]Shit.
[20:27.10]I was doing that one right too.
[20:30.59]Whatever.
[20:38.46]Don't look at me, don't look at me, don't look at me.
[20:39.90]Why didn't I hit him?
[20:40.42]Should've hit him right in the back.
[20:45.98]What's better, Executive Assault or this game?
[20:49.11]They both have their qualities.
[20:54.91]Hey, don't get me wrong, Executive Assault was, like, a fun experience.
[20:57.83]Like, that game was, like, actually interesting and fun.
[21:01.52]Me and Star just got, like, caught up in, like, walking around as dipshit executives.
[21:07.18]one bad thing about that game is the fact that it takes a long time to do anything unfortunately how do I get out of here that's in line I'm so scared to go over there and do this I could lure them out
[21:40.98]I got one.
[21:47.32]How do I do that without him seeing me?
[21:51.89]Go around- oh, actually, opportunity right now.
[21:53.67]Pull the fuck up.
[22:00.69]That actually, like, scared me.
[22:03.11]I just actually got startled by that one.
[22:05.89]I thought it was over.
[22:09.26]But this game kind of scratches an itch where, I'm assuming later on it's going to get even more difficult.
[22:14.54]The fact that you can keep trying.
[22:16.02]I can leave at any time.
[22:16.90]I can leave right now with 900 bucks.
[22:18.98]But I want to get all the money.
[22:24.15]Is there a way I can get that cash?
[22:28.13]Am I extruded?
[22:30.17]Am I excited for Fallout 4?
[22:31.63]Hell yeah.
[22:33.45]I mean, how can you not be?
[22:37.97]Unless you don't like the Fallout games, then of course you can't be excited for it.
[22:42.59]I feel like I should just blow this up.
[22:43.85]There's nothing right, there's nothing over here, right?
[22:48.18]Yeah.
[22:48.72]I mean, there was nothing there to destroy.
[22:49.98]I mean, if one of those things was there to blow up, I wouldn't want to be near it, but, you know.
[22:55.82]No machine over here?
[22:56.52]I'll blow this one up, too.
[22:58.12]Fuck it, who cares.
[23:04.91]Ugh!
[23:07.26]Where is it?
[23:07.70]Where is it?
[23:08.06]Where is it?
[23:08.42]Where is it?
[23:09.70]Where's the thing that's blinking right now?
[23:13.18]Just go get it.
[23:15.22]Should I get it?
[23:15.94]Should I try to get it?
[23:17.01]That's a bomb.
[23:20.67]Did I blow it up?
[23:21.31]I blew it up.
[23:21.81]Get me out of here.
[23:22.85]Just get me out.
[23:23.27]Go, go, go, go, go.
[23:23.95]Get me out.
[23:26.21]Before the police come and shoot me with a machine gun.
[23:28.05]Hurry up.
[23:28.37]Get out of here.
[23:28.80]Okay.
[23:29.26]Thousand dollars.
[23:32.16]Thousand bucks.
[23:35.51]60%?
[23:35.67]Yeah, that's not very good.
[23:42.41]Oh, dude, mute that pirate game.
[23:44.46]I'm gonna be all about that pirate game when it comes out.
[23:50.66]That is going to be certain... Hold... Wait a minute.
[23:54.14]Oh, those are Bionic Eyes.
[23:55.90]I see.
[23:58.08]When that pirate game comes out, that could be, like, the first real pirate game that's actually going to come out in, like, 30 years.
[24:05.59]Hold on.
[24:09.31]No, you know what?
[24:11.05]16 bucks.
[24:12.05]If you're a thief, and you go on a big heist, and you take 16 dollars, you're gonna get made fun of at the next fucking criminal convention.
[24:21.57]So we're gonna do this and then leave.
[24:24.43]So at least it wasn't a total waste of time.
[24:30.23]I can already hear the potential police coming.
[24:32.57]Let's go.
[24:34.59]Sea of Thieves.
[24:35.09]Yeah, that's the one.
[24:37.51]That is the one.
[24:39.01]There's no way I'm going to be able to beat this game in like the 90 days that you get.
[24:41.93]There's no way I'm going to beat it.
[24:45.99]Any more stuff like that happens and yeah, there's no way.
[24:52.71]What was the last good pirate game?
[24:54.01]I don't even know.
[24:57.74]I don't know.
[24:59.48]Does anybody in the chat know?
[25:02.16]Assassin's Creed Black Flag, but that was like... That was just an Assassin's Creed game with pirate ships in it.
[25:09.23]Has there been like a legit... Like Sid Meier's Pirates?
[25:12.01]Wasn't that supposed to be pretty good?
[25:19.13]Wasn't there like a... Not like the Nintendo 64...
[25:28.93]Okay, I can upgrade something here.
[25:31.38]Open locked doors.
[25:32.20]I don't think I really care about that, though.
[25:33.54]I mean, unless later on that becomes a thing that I need to do.
[25:39.91]There has never been a good one.
[25:46.11]Man, there really hasn't ever been a good pirate game.
[25:50.47]I mean, I don't count... I'm not counting Monkey Island.
[25:53.49]Because Monkey Island is like... An point-and-click adventure game that's pirate-themed.
[25:58.75]I'm talking about like my... Why can I not say the word?
[26:03.93]Mount the Cannons.
[26:06.11]Mind the Cannons?
[26:07.19]What the hell am I talking about?
[26:09.20]I'm talking about Mount the Cannons.
[26:11.36]Pirate ship battles.
[26:13.66]Like go to the tavern and punch a dude in the face.
[26:16.54]It hasn't been a good one of those in a very long time.
[26:19.60]Duels, like pirate duels with the swords, like fencing and shit.
[26:22.34]There hasn't been one of those in a very long time.
[26:25.17]And you saw the one that I played.
[26:28.13]It was... It was an engine.
[26:31.19]What's going on?
[26:33.77]What's happening?
[26:35.75]Is my, like, fucking ship under attack?
[26:39.94]You don't play music like that unless you're under attack.
[26:46.16]What is happening?
[26:47.14]Why is the camera zooming out?
[26:50.98]Am I missing something here?
[26:52.04]Okay.
[26:53.28]Alright, we're just gonna go.
[26:58.77]This game's making me lose my mind.
[27:05.65]Let's keep going.
[27:09.78]I'm going- I won 100% this time. 100%.
[27:16.21]I'm gonna be very, very careful.
[27:18.91]I want every single scent that's inside of this place.
[27:33.35]Let's pretend that- we can just pretend I didn't do that.
[27:38.66]No, a lot- live- oh, live TV, guys.
[27:41.12]You can see, like, the amount of times I fuck up.
[27:57.95]fuck up and play enough is enough no more like walking into the first guy this has always been my biggest problem as a gamer no fucking way I was right there fucking come on just stop fucking just who cares
[28:28.10]I think I give a shit.
[28:38.66]I'm 100%ing this level.
[28:39.18]For real.
[28:56.77]I really am just getting crapped on.
[29:06.21]Point the other way!
[29:07.49]What if somebody... What if I was working with another guy and he came the other way?
[29:10.45]You'd be in big trouble with your boss.
[29:15.65]That might just go around this guy.
[29:19.69]That really might... Got him.
[29:22.00]Yeah.
[29:23.82]Eat shit.
[29:38.24]I can still do it.
[29:39.44]No, I can't.
[29:39.96]I'm not kidding.
[29:40.55]I still have time.
[29:51.67]Climb up right to fucking glass and get in.
[29:53.91]Get in.
[29:56.88]Yeah, get... Fuck you.
[29:57.76]This is another one.
[30:05.90]I can get it.
[30:06.18]I can do it.
[30:09.76]There's no way to go down that way.
[30:21.45]Shit.
[30:26.46]I'll make it.
[30:30.84]Jumped right over that guy.
[30:34.42]I legit just jumped over that guy's head.
[30:36.45]That was great.
[30:38.77]70% is not quite 100%.
[30:39.37]Unfortunately.
[30:46.58]No, this game's addicting, man.
[30:49.32]Yeah, normally I'd like stealth games not to be randomly generated.
[30:51.78]It adds a little bit of, like...
[30:55.29]It adds a total amount of surprise to it because, yeah, you can make, like, routes and you can, you know, oh, I know exactly where to go.
[31:02.07]But I like not knowing exactly what's going on.
[31:04.36]It's kind of cool.
[31:04.96]And can I actually get a useful thing here?
[31:08.24]I can have three bombs.
[31:09.48]That seems pretty useful.
[31:15.34]What else is there?
[31:19.22]That's hacking level two.
[31:21.90]Just for the purpose of seeing what the hell these do.
[31:25.12]Improvement to foot technology will leave your thieves lighter.
[31:29.02]Anti-gravity boosters in your backpack.
[31:31.86]Oh, so that means you won't die.
[31:35.16]When you fall from a high height.
[31:37.92]That's cool.
[31:40.80]Can you upgrade the bat?
[31:43.40]Oh yeah, you can.
[31:44.70]What does it do?
[31:46.76]These will pack more of a punch with every swing.
[31:48.50]That's actually, that's $30,000.
[31:52.78]I can't even steal more than, like, 600 a run.
[31:55.52]You think I'm gonna be able to do that?
[31:56.44]Oh, hey, dude.
[32:02.44]I'm glad you caught my stream.
[32:03.73]Purely by coincidence.
[32:06.53]Uh... This is the fir- It's funny you say that, because this is, like, the first time I've done a livestream in, like... It's, like, seven months.
[32:14.95]Here's more music.
[32:17.10]This music's a lot nicer.
[32:19.32]I'm not scared of this music.
[32:23.16]Yeah, they're pounds.
[32:23.86]Yeah, I'm calling them dollars because my feeble brain can understand it better if I say dollars.
[32:29.51]Oh, actually, this might be interesting.
[32:39.19]$4,000.
[32:41.61]I don't think I need... You know what?
[32:42.45]I'm going to hold on to it because... How much is it to actually go to the next area?
[32:48.44]Upgrade security clearance.
[32:50.62]How do I do that?
[32:52.48]I think it's in Miscellaneous.
[32:53.74]Let's find out.
[32:59.69]What the hell is going on?
[33:05.19]Why can I... I think that's screwed up.
[33:13.18]Yeah, I guess something's locked there.
[33:14.96]Maybe there's a bug or something.
[33:17.76]Whatever, let's get some more money.
[33:21.06]Yeah, dude, trying to get to level five.
[33:23.36]In the time period that I have at this point.
[33:31.25]I've spent almost 20 days on the first level.
[33:35.77]I ain't gonna be one of those guys that, oh yeah, I beat the swindle in like 15 days.
[33:39.45]It's not gonna be me.
[33:43.69]Let's go a little bit more unconventional with this, though.
[33:45.63]I feel like we've been going too conventional.
[33:48.27]What thief breaks in the front door?
[33:49.91]You know?
[33:51.37]Not a very good one.
[33:55.36]I knew it.
[33:56.02]I knew it.
[33:56.24]You know what?
[33:56.88]See?
[33:57.08]And a good thief will know when his head trips the mine.
[34:01.52]Like mine did.
[34:05.90]This level looks fairly straightforward, so I should be able to do this at least... I'm gonna say 80%.
[34:17.87]Do not come down here.
[34:18.77]Okay.
[34:23.90]Alrighty.
[34:29.76]I just... I need patience if I'm going to do this.
[34:34.16]That was exactly what I needed to do and I did it.
[34:37.96]That could not have gone more smoothly.
[34:39.31]I wonder how many other enemy types are in this game.
[34:50.61]Now, there's just one dollar there, right?
[34:52.71]That other mine, randomly generated, that doesn't matter.
[34:54.65]I just need to get that one buck.
[34:57.97]Sounds easy enough.
[34:58.57]Pick it up, thank you.
[35:00.91]I hope there's not one.
[35:01.69]There's not one sitting underneath that guy over there, right?
[35:03.69]Like, over underneath him.
[35:05.25]His body.
[35:09.90]Because if that's the case, I'm not going to be happy.
[35:11.52]But, you know, whatever.
[35:17.40]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[35:18.04]That guy looked like he was coming up.
[35:19.86]Didn't it?
[35:20.52]That guy looked like the flying robot with the funny face.
[35:24.16]It looked like he was on his way up.
[35:25.22]Oh, shit.
[35:29.46]In my pants.
[35:33.18]Actually, it might be... I'm gonna go around.
[35:35.17]That's probably a better idea, because I can get a much better angle that way.
[35:41.99]Any other games you want to stream in the future?
[35:43.59]I have a list of games I want to stream.
[35:46.10]There's, like, probably five to ten games on that list.
[35:50.66]I just happened to pick this game tonight because this is just a short kind of trial stream while I get everything ready and to stream more often.
[35:59.12]And, yeah, I know I've said that about a thousand times before.
[36:01.67]I've done, like, little... Oh, Hand of Fate!
[36:04.29]Hey, guys, I'm gonna play Hand of Fate today, and... Yeah, I'm gonna start streaming every day.
[36:08.95]Oh, did eight months go by?
[36:13.97]But this is going to be the real deal.
[36:15.87]Because I have moved.
[36:18.06]I'm in the process of being almost completely moved into my new place.
[36:22.88]So that should be a thing.
[36:24.00]How... I'm going to have to break the glass down here, right?
[36:28.54]Yep.
[36:29.28]And then, very carefully... Can I hack it?
[36:33.79]Yes, I can.
[36:35.61]Well... Well... What did I do wrong?
[36:45.63]Did I just not do it fast enough or something?
[36:47.27]What am I missing here?
[36:52.79]I must have just not... You know what?
[36:53.96]I must not be doing it fast enough.
[37:00.46]I hit left.
[37:01.18]It was like, ooh, you did it.
[37:03.68]I hit left.
[37:04.98]I didn't hit left.
[37:06.40]I hit left.
[37:07.60]Say what you did.
[37:08.22]Did anybody else see the camera?
[37:11.38]Because I didn't.
[37:13.84]If anybody else saw that camera in the chat, I will admit defeat.
[37:17.36]I didn't see it.
[37:22.06]I'm going... I'm so empty-handed.
[37:23.76]I'm going so empty-handed these last, like... Son of a bitch, man.
[37:37.95]It's not gonna get easier, that's the thing.
[37:43.93]I'm seeing did not know.
[37:44.97]I'm seeing a bunch of no's.
[37:46.43]Okay, so I don't feel bad for that one.
[37:49.06]Because nobody saw that camera.
[37:50.92]It was in a place where you couldn't see it.
[37:53.26]So we're going to chalk that one up for... I got screwed.
[38:01.01]No cameras pointing directly at the door?
[38:03.63]Good.
[38:04.95]Let's see what's going on here.
[38:10.49]Oh.
[38:11.55]I just must not have been doing it fast enough.
[38:13.27]That's the only thing I can think of.
[38:14.15]Can I pick them up or something?
[38:18.07]No.
[38:18.59]They're just designed to do this.
[38:20.57]Because now when he walks over here, he can go through the door, he'll get hit by it, and I will be happy.
[38:27.70]There's a camera right there.
[38:30.24]There's nothing in this room, so there's no reason to go this way.
[38:37.75]There's a reason to go in this room, but I know I'm never going to get that money.
[38:44.01]You know what?
[38:44.61]Here's what's going to happen.
[38:45.61]That's going to be a last resort.
[38:49.07]The way you lose money in this game is you don't get these things.
[38:52.41]Because when you get spotted, they lose money every second or so.
[38:58.78]So this one looks like it's going to be a lot easier to get.
[39:00.78]Although, damn it, man, that camera is going to cause a lot of problems.
[39:16.16]The guy on the left does not go far enough to see me.
[39:19.30]Does the little robot with the funny face go far enough to see me?
[39:21.80]That's important.
[39:26.08]Looks like he's not moving very much.
[39:28.74]So I just have to time this right to go like right now.
[39:33.91]Because I won't be spotted.
[39:34.89]Those two guys stay over there and I can get all the money out of that machine.
[39:40.21]Well, I can sit here and talk about it all day or I can do it.
[39:42.59]So here we go.
[39:42.99]We're going to go now.
[39:47.98]Okay, it didn't do it.
[39:50.06]I tried to activate it.
[39:51.20]I guess it wasn't close enough, so we're gonna chicken out and do it again.
[39:56.39]Right... No.
[40:05.31]Holy fuck.
[40:06.11]Okay.
[40:08.17]Just in time.
[40:10.43]Are there any more of those machines?
[40:14.03]I don't think I see any, but there could be.
[40:16.71]Let's drop down here.
[40:25.00]I don't know.
[40:25.36]I'm gonna have to go inside.
[40:28.46]I don't think you can hack the camera.
[40:33.34]They can see through the windows, though.
[40:35.18]That's something I need to realize.
[40:36.44]Where the fuck am I going?
[40:42.25]I just freaked out right there.
[41:01.15]What?
[41:02.59]What am I doing wrong with those?
[41:05.15]I didn't do anything wrong right there.
[41:10.65]What the fuck am I doing wrong?
[41:16.80]I'm just not gonna do that anymore.
[41:19.92]Like what the hell?
[41:25.51]Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong there?
[41:27.43]I'm doing the right inputs.
[41:41.10]I have no idea what the hell's going on.
[41:44.85]Uh, for the purposes of figuring out what the hell I'm doing wrong, I don't think I'm gonna touch these anymore.
[41:50.21]Am I just not fast enough?
[41:51.25]I'm on trial.
[41:57.30]I was even slower on that one, and it didn't blow up.
[42:01.30]Right?
[42:01.52]Okay, the other one was two times, and it blew up.
[42:04.28]That time was three times, and it didn't blow up.
[42:06.52]And I did the right inputs.
[42:09.50]Are there other mines that are smaller and they look different or something and they're harder to do?
[42:15.76]I don't know.
[42:17.06]But I'm not going to pretend to know.
[42:18.48]Alright, let's get some money.
[42:31.35]Can I actually get a takeaway in one of these?
[42:33.77]Because I believe it's five... See, for that one I knew.
[42:38.24]That's why I turned around and ran.
[42:43.06]What am I doing in here?
[42:44.02]There's nothing even in here.
[42:45.78]There's no money in there.
[42:46.62]There's money in there.
[42:51.75]And two of the easiest enemies in the game.
[43:00.88]Climb on.
[43:01.42]Don't freak out.
[43:14.13]Alright.
[43:17.09]So far, so good.
[43:20.03]How am I ever expected to do this?
[43:24.12]You got this guy, like, freaking out on too much caffeine, looking back and forth.
[43:27.02]You got the robot, you got the mine, you got this other dickhead on the right.
[43:29.36]What am I supposed to do here?
[43:34.90]Uh, yeah, forget that.
[43:36.50]We're not going that way.
[43:38.32]There's money in there, too, but that's a hard room.
[43:40.20]I'm not sure I want to even risk that, because I have enough money right now, I think, to get to the next area.
[43:52.70]Is there a deeper ground area down here?
[43:54.90]Yeah, there is.
[44:00.69]But there's not very much down... You know what?
[44:02.43]I actually don't care at this point if I trigger the alarm.
[44:06.97]Because... It's just money on the ground.
[44:10.39]And I can scoop up a bunch of it and leave.
[44:13.08]So I'm not that concerned if I don't do this as clean as possible.
[44:16.72]I almost just locked myself in the room with the camera.
[44:22.87]Yeah, see, right now, I could just leave.
[44:24.47]But I'm a psycho, and I need to get everything.
[44:28.25]That's why I can't play games like this.
[44:29.53]I'm, like, too much of a widow.
[44:32.33]And I can't... That's why I don't gamble, either.
[44:33.77]I don't go to, like, Vegas.
[44:34.79]I don't go to, like, casinos.
[44:37.94]Because I never stop.
[44:40.58]You know what?
[44:40.86]I'm going to go this way.
[44:42.34]I get up, like, 300 bucks, and I'm like, Oh, 300 bucks!
[44:44.90]Free money!
[44:46.36]And then I, like, owe $200 to the casino.
[44:48.86]Because I lose, like, 17 hands of blackjack in a row.
[44:52.92]So I can't do this.
[44:54.64]Remind me to never be a criminal.
[44:55.80]Because I wouldn't be very good at it.
[45:03.88]Actually, that's a pretty good entry point up here.
[45:06.40]If I drop down right there, I'm okay with that.
[45:09.16]Alright.
[45:19.97]Good to go.
[45:21.57]Just gotta get by this camera.
[45:25.60]What is in here?
[45:27.16]I'm telling you, there's a money machine down there.
[45:30.68]There is a money machine down there.
[45:31.82]There has to be.
[45:32.84]Why would they put it all the way down there?
[45:34.08]Of course they would.
[45:34.66]I need to time this correctly.
[45:40.89]I can do it right now.
[45:41.81]After he turns around, I should be able to right... No, not right now.
[45:47.17]I can do it right... now.
[45:51.23]I was supposed to go when I said now, but I got attached to too many walls.
[45:56.51]Can you hack the cameras?
[45:57.90]I keep people saying you can hack the cameras.
[46:00.90]Just a hook on the wall like Spider-Man, dude.
[46:06.54]How do you get that close?
[46:07.30]Let's see what happens if I get close.
[46:11.41]I don't think so.
[46:12.87]Unless it's something you have to get as an upgrade later, because I got pretty close right there.
[46:16.47]Unless I'm doing something weird.
[46:19.95]Okay, I'm going to have to get this thing to blow up.
[46:24.72]No.
[46:26.12]No, it's not worth it.
[46:27.06]It isn't.
[46:27.32]It really isn't.
[46:27.98]I should just leave.
[46:30.23]Alright, look.
[46:30.59]We're gonna do... I'm gonna run.
[46:33.85]We're going.
[46:35.29]Don't give a fuck.
[46:39.37]It's okay.
[46:39.93]It's alright.
[46:40.23]It doesn't matter.
[46:41.53]Give me the money.
[46:44.75]I just gotta get out.
[46:45.40]Because, seriously, I just gotta get out of here.
[46:49.30]I have enough money.
[46:50.54]I'm good.
[46:50.84]I almost got a thousand dollars from that.
[46:52.06]Let's go.
[46:52.42]See you later.
[46:55.87]Now I've got 95%.
[46:57.05]I almost got 100%.
[46:58.95]What did I miss?
[47:00.87]You know, I... That cop picked it up when he walked over it, I think.
[47:04.19]Shit.
[47:07.13]Yep.
[47:08.25]That is exactly what happened.
[47:09.19]I would have had 100% too.
[47:13.19]Okay.
[47:16.29]Let's look at this now.
[47:19.50]Here we go.
[47:20.08]Security clearance.
[47:22.02]Oh, it was 4,000.
[47:23.56]So I can go to the next area.
[47:24.68]Let's do it.
[47:29.88]Let's go ahead and give it a try.
[47:34.03]Let's go ahead and do it.
[47:35.81]I keep hitting back.
[47:39.57]This is such a bad idea.
[47:40.51]I'm not ready to go to the next level.
[47:44.72]I'm just staying in the peewee leagues a little more.
[47:46.48]I'm not ready for this.
[47:50.16]But we're going to try it anyways.
[47:52.62]Okay, that was the slums warehouse district.
[47:54.58]Lined along the banks of the Thames, Thames, am I saying that wrong?
[47:58.74]Is a vast array of colossal warehouses, each docked to the river to allow easy, important export of goods around the world.
[48:06.08]London's fantastical industrial growth, means practically everything from cogs to hack chips, is manufactured and shipped from here.
[48:14.91]Other stuff, I guess it's just storyline stuff.
[48:17.49]We're going to check it out.
[48:21.19]This is a different area.
[48:26.57]These areas look a lot bigger.
[48:30.23]New enemy types.
[48:32.79]Wonderful.
[48:35.45]You got like a little shithole clap trap down there.
[48:38.17]Let's go see what he does.
[48:41.42]Hey, remember that thing that told me I should have owned the locked doors thing?
[48:45.40]And I said it wasn't worth it?
[48:48.46]Yeah, that, uh, seems like it's worth it now, because I can't physically get into this place.
[48:52.72]Yeah, I gotta break a window.
[48:58.71]Oh, they got guns now.
[48:59.91]Those things have guns in their head.
[49:01.53]What does this guy do?
[49:03.65]I'm, these guys, I don't know, I kind of want to just see what happens.
[49:06.53]What the hell, that's a big bag of fucking money!
[49:09.13]Holy shit, nice.
[49:10.96]And we got it.
[49:13.36]These guys don't have line of sight.
[49:15.30]I don't understand what they do.
[49:19.66]I'm... I don't want to touch them because I feel like something's gonna happen, but at the same time... Why risk it when you already have that, like, 100 bucks?
[49:30.53]These big brutes, though.
[49:33.47]One hit.
[49:35.99]Two hits.
[49:37.65]It's probably gonna be three hits.
[49:38.57]I would assume, right?
[49:50.86]Big bag of money.
[49:51.48]Two big bags of money.
[49:54.26]And a mine.
[49:56.82]I gotta get better at doing those mines, man.
[49:58.28]They're such a... God.
[50:01.48]Damn it.
[50:01.86]I don't want to do it, but I have to.
[50:03.22]We're gonna try.
[50:07.93]I'm gonna do it as clean as I can.
[50:09.87]And if I lose, I lose.
[50:10.87]But you know what?
[50:11.29]We gotta try.
[50:25.11]Hold on, hold on, hold tight.
[50:31.99]There's nothing up there.
[50:34.49]Is there anything underneath that guy?
[50:35.53]I love this addition of the door cube this month.
[50:43.35]Yeah, man, the door cube.
[50:45.19]Make sure you sign up and buy one.
[50:46.73]Use my, uh, use my hashtag.
[50:51.20]There's all kinds of cool... I am just so concerned about this.
[50:57.40]Okay, there's nothing up here, but I just want to hit this fucking guy in his little fucking face.
[51:04.91]Now I can leave.
[51:05.43]Yeah, the big guy is like... Is he standing on something?
[51:14.40]They wouldn't just put him there, would they?
[51:17.28]I feel like they wouldn't just, like, put the guy there for no reason.
[51:19.94]I'm doing this slow enough where I think I could be okay.
[51:26.37]I just wasn't even close.
[51:28.39]I was close.
[51:28.87]No, I was close.
[51:30.03]I walked right into it.
[51:31.05]What am I gonna... What am I gonna... Like, the lie?
[51:32.65]Hey, newsflash.
[51:35.11]You can't, like, lie when, like, people are, like, actively watching.
[51:38.10]I wasn't even close.
[51:38.84]Yeah, I wasn't even close.
[51:40.94]He was so close.
[51:42.62]Trying to, like, swindle your way out of that one.
[51:47.15]No, fuck it.
[51:47.71]The police can come.
[51:51.92]No, they can't.
[51:52.36]I don't think I physically can go anymore.
[51:54.00]Because I don't have the... Actually, I can go up top.
[51:59.58]Oh, shit.
[52:00.20]No, bye.
[52:00.78]I have $2,600.
[52:01.12]Are you serious?
[52:05.03]That's more money than I've ever seen in this game.
[52:11.31]Oh, come on.
[52:13.15]Woohoo!
[52:21.27]That is... Okay, they don't fuck around.
[52:23.92]One thing I will say about this, after you get past the... Okay, you know in Bubble Bobble, those of you that played the game Bubble Bobble for the regular Nintendo, if you took too long on a stage, this scary, like, skeleton ghost would come after you, and he didn't fuck around at all.
[52:41.55]You were dead.
[52:42.39]If you saw that and it played the music, you were toast.
[52:45.07]That's the skeleton ghost from Bubble Bobble.
[52:47.77]That thing right there.
[52:48.49]He don't fuck around.
[52:55.05]Now I got five grand.
[52:59.36]Okay, hack speed.
[53:00.30]Thank you very much.
[53:04.78]What the hell does that mean?
[53:08.70]Tiny canisters of adrenaline embedded in the heart are shattered upon activation of the hack interface?
[53:16.95]I don't really know what that means.
[53:20.46]Oh.
[53:21.27]That was, like, the description of what it is.
[53:23.47]So that I hack faster.
[53:25.59]I thank you.
[53:26.11]I will take that.
[53:26.85]Absolutely.
[53:30.63]This guy's a pretty grizzled guy.
[53:34.78]Dork cube.
[53:36.42]I...
[53:42.61]I had a conversation about this with somebody, and you tell me, you guys tell me that it's a good idea.
[53:47.39]So, like, the whole thing, like, loot crate, right?
[53:51.25]Everybody gets the same box.
[53:53.47]Don't they have, like, oh, maybe, like, sometimes it'll be, like, one random box?
[53:57.37]What if there was one of these companies?
[53:58.89]Like, okay, like a door cube, or, like, a shit block, I don't even care what you call it.
[54:04.16]What if one of these companies, instead of it being, like, everybody gets kind of the same exact thing, can I get in here?
[54:11.91]Or am I locked out forever?
[54:15.82]Hold on.
[54:16.34]I'll continue that in a second.
[54:17.20]I don't think I can even play this level.
[54:20.04]I don't think I can play this level.
[54:23.18]I'm completely locked out.
[54:24.74]Unless there's a window somewhere.
[54:29.82]Anyways.
[54:30.50]So, what if a company did a box while I move to the exit because I can't play?
[54:39.26]What if a company did a box... That was... Like, you had a chance... Let's say there's like 5,000 of these boxes of like the shit block go out, right?
[54:49.43]You open it up, you take off the wrapping paper, and you might get, like, one of the common ones.
[54:54.33]And the common one, uh, there's, like, two stickers in it.
[54:57.39]It's like a blue box, so you know it's like, ah, shit, I got the common one.
[55:01.32]It's got, like, two Mega Man stickers in it.
[55:03.24]Oh, whoop-de-fuckin'-do.
[55:04.76]But, you might get, like, the green box.
[55:07.30]And if you take the wrapping paper off and there's a green box in there, it's like, hold on a second, this is one of the rares.
[55:12.22]This is a rare.
[55:14.24]Alright, kinda cool.
[55:15.84]That's interesting.
[55:16.90]And in that box might be, like, there might be, like, a Super Nintendo game in there.
[55:21.46]There might be, like, two, like, PS4 games.
[55:24.34]It's, like, cool shit in there.
[55:26.40]And then you've got a red box.
[55:27.85]If you take off the wrapping paper and there's a fucking red box in there, holy shit, this one might have a solid gold bar in it.
[55:35.93]Like, worth $700,000.
[55:37.23]Oh, wait, you want, like, the door cube?
[55:41.41]That's fine.
[55:42.00]This box might have a solid gold bar in it.
[55:45.84]How come people don't do that?
[55:48.68]That would be, like, cool.
[55:51.04]How many people would buy that just thinking potentially they get, like, one of the five boxes that have the gold bar in it?
[56:02.59]I can't play this level.
[56:09.27]I have to leave.
[56:12.52]Goodbye.
[56:13.04]I didn't buy the upgrade.
[56:19.60]Seriously, am I missing something?
[56:20.70]Or can I physically not play this one?
[56:26.26]Yeah, I mean, you could say that, oh, well, that's like a lottery.
[56:28.60]But is it, though?
[56:29.16]I mean, even if... If I play the lottery, right?
[56:33.10]I'm not gonna get, like, a couple Mega Man stickers.
[56:34.88]Like, guaranteed.
[56:35.80]You're, like, guaranteed to get, like, potentially, like, two Mega Man stickers.
[56:40.21]Okay, I... Wait, hold on.
[56:42.33]I thought I saw something down here.
[56:43.33]No.
[56:43.45]I'm gonna restart the level.
[56:48.01]And yeah, what is going on with that door?
[56:57.68]What is that door?
[57:00.03]Who wants to be in that room?
[57:03.99]It's a room that's big enough for a door to open on either side.
[57:12.39]I can't wait to make my house.
[57:13.81]Oh, make sure, don't forget the room that's inside of the walls.
[57:17.57]That has a door that can open.
[57:25.09]How much a month for the box?
[57:27.68]It could be like ten bucks.
[57:31.36]That door is locked, right?
[57:32.72]Fuck, man.
[57:33.30]Am I at a hard wall?
[57:34.32]Can I not play the game anymore?
[57:35.96]There we go.
[57:38.48]Remind me to get that upgrade, because holy shit, this is going to be hard without it.
[57:47.78]See, I knew I fucked that one up.
[57:51.47]You know what?
[57:51.87]I gotta stop doing that with the analog.
[57:55.47]Yeah, but $10 for two stickers or $10 for a solid gold $100,000 gold bar.
[57:59.87]You know what I mean?
[58:01.95]Is it kind of like a... This guy's got like a mask on.
[58:10.54]Or is this a girl?
[58:11.08]I think this is a girl.
[58:14.24]Let's see.
[58:14.94]Can we like zoom in?
[58:22.04]Yeah, he's got like the thing on his- on her face or whatever.
[58:30.29]I can go in the glass right here.
[58:34.89]That's literal gambling.
[58:37.79]Yeah, but like if you buy a lottery ticket, it's- you don't get anything.
[58:42.94]Imagine if you bought a lottery ticket and somebody gave you like two Mega Man stickers or something, alright?
[58:47.26]See, now I'm just talking and I'm just walking into shit.
[58:53.20]You know what?
[58:55.61]I'm just gonna wait.
[58:56.49]We're gonna wait for the cops to show up.
[58:57.61]I'm gonna close the door.
[58:58.33]See what happens.
[59:01.45]They can't get me.
[59:04.17]Yeah, I'd like to see them get into the locked door.
[59:18.65]Where are they?
[59:22.12]I would have thought they would have been here by now.
[59:28.93]Oh, here they are.
[59:30.83]Here they are.
[59:32.11]Can they get in the locked door?
[59:33.76]Yep, they can.
[59:38.14]Actually, I don't really need to be worried about the helicopter that flies around.
[59:41.26]That can't even go indoors.
[59:46.35]That looks like a room of interest.
[59:52.88]Alright, they have a charging attack.
[59:54.52]Good to know.
[59:58.82]They probably have a key.
[60:03.00]Have I gotten Dirty Bomb or Rocket League working?
[60:04.62]I got Rocket League working, but it's just not my kind of game.
[60:09.61]I played it for a little bit.
[60:10.49]I played it with Star for a little bit, and it was just like, it's... What the fuck is this caterpillar with the top hat on?
[60:16.23]I wonder if I can kill this.
[60:22.25]I did not get dirty while I'm working, though.
[60:24.63]So, unfortunately, that happened.
[60:29.85]Well, he... I feel bad for that guy.
[60:35.51]I feel bad for that guy.
[60:36.71]He didn't... He was just trying to be like a robot slug.
[60:40.00]Why did I need to do that to him?
[60:42.36]That wasn't very nice.
[60:50.58]Seems like he got, like, enraged.
[60:51.92]Kind of like the caterpillar from Mario.
[60:53.30]I want to see if my hypothesis is correct here.
[60:56.58]Is he, like, enraged?
[61:01.24]Keep an eye on him.
[61:03.65]He looks pretty red, right?
[61:06.79]He's kind of... Is he?
[61:08.17]I don't know.
[61:19.86]Shit.
[61:23.20]Watch out for the mine.
[61:25.14]Don't be an idiot and trip the mine.
[61:26.79]I don't know about this.
[61:34.44]I don't know about this, guys.
[61:37.74]I just don't know about this.
[62:03.33]Have I made any money at all?
[62:05.62]Have I even pulled in one?
[62:06.72]I have $71.
[62:07.50]Fucking, is there like a, I, whatever upgrade I can get that is like, just walk over mines upgrades.
[62:18.45]I'm definitely getting it.
[62:23.29]I wanna go back to like the bunny hill.
[62:25.57]I wanna ski down the bunny hill.
[62:29.97]I'm going this way.
[62:36.33]No more fucking around.
[62:40.05]No more fucking around.
[62:46.37]Whoa, what's going on?
[62:47.07]What's he doing?
[62:47.40]What's he doing?
[62:47.72]What's he doing?
[62:52.78]Oh, I think I just figured it out.
[62:54.32]And I just did it.
[62:54.96]I figured it out in the absolute worst possible way.
[62:58.02]He is now... Can't kill me.
[63:01.58]I think I hit him and now he has like the spikes on him.
[63:03.42]I don't think I can get this machine.
[63:05.40]Because I turned him into like a death trap.
[63:14.62]Right?
[63:18.06]Maybe not.
[63:18.50]I don't know.
[63:23.72]That's a lot of money.
[63:27.37]Okay, I just have to not be stupid, and I can get, like, a huge amount of money, because this is, like, the second level.
[63:34.67]So, like, the new WWE game, like, 2K16?
[63:42.55]Man, if that's true... Visual concepts really threw that series in the trash, if that is a true statement.
[63:53.85]Mm-hmm-hmm.
[64:00.00]This might be an opportunity just to leave.
[64:01.14]Unless did I not go somewhere down here?
[64:04.66]I can't go anywhere else.
[64:07.62]Hey, that's just enough to get the upgrade for me to open doors, so I'll take that.
[64:12.87]I will take that.
[64:17.81]Oh, my ship's on the other side.
[64:20.31]Of course.
[64:25.30]But yeah, the WWE games, man, for... They were always known as, like, the most robust character creators, and it was so much fun, all the tools they would give you.
[64:33.91]To take that away is like... It's just like a fighting game.
[64:38.53]Not to say that fighting games are bad, but, like, the WWE games have, like, a very special thing that you could do.
[64:44.77]And if Visual Concepts wants to take all that away, then I think they're making a fucking huge mistake.
[64:52.28]Like, a huge mistake.
[64:58.18]Okay, where is it?
[64:59.02]Right here, right?
[65:00.68]Lock doors.
[65:01.53]Yes.
[65:02.91]Now I can actually play the game.
[65:11.21]What's going on, Roy?
[65:12.61]I'm doing good.
[65:13.19]Hey, glad to see you.
[65:15.42]It's glad to see you here at this stream, because this is not a real stream.
[65:18.64]This is a test stream.
[65:27.89]Slippin Jimmy, I love your name.
[65:30.57]That's a great show.
[65:33.41]That's a very good show.
[65:40.51]I just have any two if 2k 16 doesn't come on what?
[65:48.03]Oh shit, you gotta hack these doors like actually hack them.
[65:51.55]What happens if I fuck it up?
[65:52.61]Does it just not open?
[65:55.58]That would be interesting.
[65:59.32]Man, there's so many up-down, left-rights, I'm st... Okay, so far so good.
[66:19.83]Those guys definitely scream, I will insta-kill you if I touch you all over them, right?
[66:30.98]Again, more up, down, left, rights.
[66:32.81]I'm not good at the up, down, left, rights.
[66:34.43]I'll tell you.
[66:41.57]Whoa!
[66:42.39]Whoa!
[66:43.35]Whoa.
[66:43.78]Okay, I almost died there.
[66:46.30]I did not think he was going to get up and trip that.
[66:47.96]But he did.
[66:48.34]I'm down here.
[66:51.34]Okay.
[67:01.30]I want that.
[67:01.72]I want it.
[67:04.28]I'm gonna get it.
[67:06.64]I'm going to get it.
[67:07.32]30 bucks.
[67:12.01]It was worth it.
[67:12.57]It was worth getting the $30.
[67:13.61]On the spikes.
[67:22.27]Nice.
[67:24.47]No camera.
[67:25.01]Thank God there's no cameras in here, man.
[67:26.38]Without the cameras, this becomes a lot less ridiculous.
[67:30.77]I really hope what somebody said, you can actually hack the cameras, because seriously, it's so much easier without them being here.
[67:41.87]Just a little tap.
[67:43.27]Just a little tap.
[67:47.50]One more.
[67:47.80]One more, you big brute.
[67:50.90]Come here, you big brute.
[67:57.30]Okay.
[67:57.90]I'm gonna get a lot of money out of this computer.
[68:02.89]Thirty-one hundred.
[68:04.57]Perfect.
[68:07.79]Uh, what's up?
[68:08.97]Not a whole lot, but some money bags are up there.
[68:14.35]Go down, camera down there, but... whatever.
[68:20.96]Have to go up and around.
[68:24.88]Might be a terrible idea to do this, but... Yeah, I know, I've done stupider things.
[68:34.16]It's a good time to do this now, right?
[68:36.20]Are they both up here and they don't have their cameras pointing in the right direction?
[68:41.76]I would think so, right?
[68:42.52]Nice.
[68:45.06]Fine.
[68:45.56]Mine.
[68:45.96]And a little dude.
[68:46.50]Little dude.
[68:46.84]Little dude.
[68:47.20]Little crazy dude.
[68:47.78]Little dude.
[68:48.12]Little claptrap guy.
[68:49.71]Didn't even see him.
[68:54.05]I'm so scared to go over here.
[68:54.99]Is he dead?
[68:57.19]No, he's still alive.
[68:58.75]Of course.
[69:14.25]This way now.
[69:20.51]There might not be a reason to go in here, but there's a window over there to the left, and I think it's like a shortcut to one of the other areas.
[69:28.88]That's outside, isn't it?
[69:31.56]That is outside.
[69:32.28]Eat that.
[69:40.26]Little shit.
[69:43.89]Alright, we're outside now.
[69:47.05]Dufer... Duffer Textiles.
[69:51.51]Otto.
[69:53.81]He just, like, woke up and... My dog just, like, woke up and, like, forgot where he was.
[69:59.92]This room looks expensive, doesn't it?
[70:07.06]This room looks really expensive.
[70:09.70]Oh, boy.
[70:10.22]Come on.
[70:10.66]Give me...
[70:12.32]What?
[70:13.81]What?
[70:16.69]That can't do anything in here?
[70:17.53]That's like a supercomputer, isn't it?
[70:22.35]Oh, okay.
[70:25.03]Shit.
[70:26.19]That's too bad.
[70:26.81]That's too bad.
[70:35.68]Come on now.
[70:36.80]That was what we... That was what we called bullshit.
[70:42.67]I think it's time to bail.
[70:43.45]It's time to bail.
[70:45.51]No, you don't bail.
[70:46.07]You never bail.
[70:52.23]Now you bail.
[70:53.13]Now you bail.
[70:53.47]This is time to bail.
[70:59.71]Go on.
[71:00.13]Go on.
[71:01.29]Go on.
[71:01.59]That's a lot of money to take from this.
[71:02.85]Come on.
[71:06.37]Don't have the ghost get me.
[71:09.63]Don't have the
[71:19.84]That was a good haul.
[71:23.06]I'll take the, uh, I'll take the seven grand.
[71:30.52]That was, uh, that went okay.
[71:32.30]It could have gone a little better, but it was alright.
[71:38.56]So I wonder, what was that room?
[71:40.90]What was that other room?
[71:43.34]Seemed like there was something to do in there.
[71:47.04]Steam purge?
[71:49.34]Three seconds of cover?
[71:53.44]So I get three seconds of total invisibility, huh?
[71:59.66]Hmm.
[72:07.13]I don't know.
[72:10.85]Camera hacks, yep.
[72:12.61]Good call.
[72:13.47]Good call, guys.
[72:15.63]Where is that?
[72:20.32]That's bionic eyes.
[72:23.98]Allows the crook astonishing levels of visual.
[72:25.58]No, that's just like more... Hack aptitude.
[72:31.74]Extra money from hacking.
[72:33.12]Ugh.
[72:34.52]Ugh.
[72:36.70]Hack speed.
[72:39.52]Where is it?
[72:39.88]Is it in tools?
[72:40.76]It's bombs.
[72:45.08]Bomb strength.
[72:49.18]Steam Purge bug count?
[72:51.50]Your thief can carry one bug per heist.
[72:56.68]Why do I want to put bugs in my backpack?
[73:01.52]Goggles.
[73:03.16]Show noise.
[73:03.74]It allows you to see precisely how much noise your thief is making.
[73:06.09]Computers.
[73:11.55]You can now leave only when you're completely satisfied that you've thoroughly cleaned the place.
[73:15.91]Level scanner.
[73:18.87]Security station locator app Hold on police interference, ooh I like this one a lot How much is the
[73:45.64]Yeah, this one's $20,000.
[73:47.16]So this is the turn off the security station.
[73:48.88]Starting down cameras, drones, and any active security.
[73:50.89]That's $20,000.
[73:54.91]I don't have $20,000.
[73:56.43]But I do have enough money to slow the police down.
[74:02.29]Which is good.
[74:04.82]Because they always seem to come very quickly.
[74:07.66]And we'll also do...
[74:15.10]Can I do anything else?
[74:17.16]I don't think I can do anything else.
[74:25.76]No, I can't do anything else.
[74:28.24]Well, at least I won't get immediately picked off.
[74:35.47]How long have I been streaming for?
[74:36.47]I thought this was going to be like a 10 minute stream.
[74:37.99]It's been like an hour and 15 minutes.
[74:43.32]We'll do it for a little longer.
[74:44.16]A little bit longer, a little bit longer.
[74:55.46]Put that guy in the worst place possible, because if I fall down from there, I'm gonna get triggered by that and get hit.
[75:01.68]Might actually happen right now.
[75:06.25]This is extremely suspicious, and why does it say caution?
[75:10.11]Why does it say caution?
[75:12.87]I don't know if I trust this.
[75:14.09]Caution?
[75:14.49]Caution to what?
[75:15.41]Why?
[75:17.87]Okay.
[75:20.26]Sure.
[75:32.53]I can't do anything with those rooms.
[75:38.65]Don't do anything cool for like two minutes.
[75:40.27]I gotta go do something.
[75:41.10]It's about time to do something cool.
[75:42.52]Quick, guys.
[75:42.84]What can I do?
[75:43.54]I gotta do something wicked cool.
[75:45.54]Check this.
[75:45.90]Watch.
[75:46.08]Ready?
[75:54.77]And I hacked it.
[75:56.25]That was pretty damn cool.
[76:00.87]There's no window here.
[76:06.94]Oh, the computers up here shut the cameras off.
[76:10.72]Right, okay, I see what you're saying, I see.
[76:15.19]I see what you're saying.
[76:18.67]We're gonna go down.
[76:21.31]So many of these, look at all these caterpillars!
[76:22.93]I'm actually glad to see them.
[76:30.66]Like, seriously, I don't give a shit, I'm not gonna be jumping on them.
[76:39.98]You know what it is?
[76:40.82]Figured it out.
[76:41.60]I figured out why I have trouble with the mines.
[76:45.98]It scares me.
[76:47.62]That noise that it makes, that like... Scary.
[76:52.55]It makes me jump.
[76:54.37]That's really it.
[76:54.87]That's all I can say.
[76:56.51]It's a very jumpy thing.
[77:03.49]These guys concern me a lot because they can shoot now.
[77:07.04]And I think one hit and you're pretty much just dead.
[77:11.78]Didn't hit that guy.
[77:12.60]What?
[77:12.82]I don't know what's over there, so I ran back.
[77:24.95]I didn't even need to run back, but I ran back because I didn't know what was over here and it startled me.
[77:29.07]It scared a lot of guys.
[77:30.03]I'm sorry.
[77:36.88]Fuck.
[77:39.38]I just forgot.
[77:40.82]I just totally absentmindedly just forgot that that happens.
[77:44.04]Because I never had it happen to me.
[77:46.97]And I just... I just forgot.
[77:53.55]Do it again.
[77:54.03]I jumped right on top of it.
[78:03.97]This game is addicting.
[78:05.35]It's too addicting.
[78:06.15]I should have just left.
[78:09.41]But now I'm doing it again.
[78:10.62]I was only going to stream for, like, three minutes.
[78:19.38]Do you see how, like, stressful that is?
[78:21.60]That's extremely stressful.
[78:25.11]Don't... Perfect.
[78:26.79]Do not jump on those fucking things.
[78:30.03]Fuck, it's one doll.
[78:30.91]Forget it.
[78:31.23]Oh, okay.
[78:31.63]Can't go up that way.
[78:38.20]Nothing is over there of interest.
[78:41.02]Holy shit, how did I not get seen?
[78:43.63]That was outrageous that I didn't get spotted.
[78:48.01]That was absolutely a game-ending.
[78:49.53]You got spotted right there.
[78:50.69]No question.
[79:00.02]Then I'm knocking him into the spikes.
[79:01.08]That's the best thing to do.
[79:02.86]That guy's a moron.
[79:04.36]He just fell into the spikes like an idiot.
[79:10.89]This is a good takeaway.
[79:13.35]I really shouldn't screw this up.
[79:15.25]But, you know, that's what we do around here.
[79:17.74]So, might as well.
[79:22.10]How much is the security camera hack?
[79:23.30]20,000?
[79:23.82]I should probably just save up for it.
[79:28.55]Pretty good idea.
[79:39.17]Still don't know what these guys do.
[79:41.33]I have no idea.
[79:45.71]I don't know.
[79:46.13]What ha- I don't know.
[79:49.65]We're not gonna find out right now with $5,000 in our pocket.
[79:52.23]Absolutely not gonna find out now.
[80:10.10]I've almost got pretty much all the money.
[80:13.14]Except for that one dollar that I didn't get back there.
[80:27.16]Screw you, camera.
[80:28.02]Get out of here.
[80:34.01]That's it for that.
[80:34.51]There's a little bundle right there.
[80:36.99]I could get that if I really wanted to.
[80:38.29]And there's a big bundle right here.
[80:39.51]Alright, we're going big bundle and then potentially little bundle.
[80:44.56]If I can do it.
[80:45.14]If it's possible, I'm going to do it.
[80:48.66]But it might not be possible.
[81:00.07]If I fell right there, I would have been real mad.
[81:01.49]Because it would have killed me.
[81:09.45]There's nothing really else to do.
[81:17.08]Yeah, mute.
[81:18.56]You happen to be correct.
[81:21.37]That is correct.
[81:26.86]Something I did for a long time and doesn't mean I'll never do it again.
[81:29.88]It's just... I did it.
[81:32.24]It's done.
[81:33.82]I said pretty much all I wanted to say.
[81:36.04]All the jokes I wanted to make.
[81:38.38]About Mr. Grandpa.
[81:41.22]So I kind of just, uh... You know what?
[81:44.72]He can come back if I feel he can come back.
[81:50.41]Oh, the book.
[81:50.91]Well, yeah, we can talk about the book.
[81:53.52]I think this is the last little bit of money here, too.
[81:56.84]So, the book.
[81:58.28]Uh... It's still probably going to happen.
[82:02.94]But I severely underestimated how much work it was.
[82:06.91]Severely.
[82:08.69]To, like, write a book that's actually worth reading... It's a lot of time.
[82:13.39]Hey, little guy!
[82:41.04]I should've left.
[82:41.54]He just- he blended in with the fucking background.
[83:02.69]He blended in with the background, that sucked.
[83:06.45]Now- now I know.
[83:08.79]Yeah, Cheshire, now I know.
[83:12.52]If you touch them, you insta-die.
[83:18.99]That sucked such ass.
[83:22.71]It was not worth the $8.
[83:29.84]I was gonna... That was turning out to be a really, really... Really good run, too.
[83:35.70]I almost had 100%.
[83:39.09]And then I just started to talk about, like, a book that I was doing, and... And then I... I... We're not even gonna... We're not gonna even go there.
[83:47.33]Close the fucking doors.
[83:48.35]Can you close the doors?
[83:50.02]These guys are just gonna walk into... You all ready?
[83:53.82]We're going for it.
[83:54.34]We're gonna go for some, like, tactics.
[83:57.96]Tactic didn't work.
[83:58.68]I'll have to close the door.
[84:02.22]Just give me this and get me out.
[84:05.84]That's 3,000.
[84:06.44]3,000 just started over again.
[84:08.14]No, we got a police delay.
[84:12.36]We got a police delay.
[84:13.50]They might not come for a little while.
[84:16.70]Well, that's a gun.
[84:18.46]Fucking... I just got... I get... Just turn in the money when you get the money.
[84:27.01]I can't... I can't gamble.
[84:28.35]I can't do it.
[84:28.89]I can't go to Vegas.
[84:29.85]I told you.
[84:33.29]Now I'm losing my shit.
[84:42.09]Ever since that little fuck ruined everything.
[84:49.07]Little dickhead.
[84:54.23]So I have to be extremely careful around those guys.
[84:56.17]If I need to, like, fall down into a room, this guy's gonna- I'm gonna land on this spike, dude.
[85:03.33]Get outta here.
[85:05.38]Get knocked through a window.
[85:14.89]I'm not fucking up this time.
[85:15.97]I'm not going to screw up this time.
[85:17.42]Seriously.
[85:19.42]Wasted enough days.
[85:20.24]I can't get through here?
[85:20.94]Shit.
[85:24.42]Okay, anyways.
[85:26.02]The book.
[85:27.80]I underestimated how much work it was.
[85:30.04]And I want it to be good.
[85:32.28]I didn't want to just release something that was just a piece of total shit.
[85:38.36]And to do that, it takes a ton of time.
[85:41.14]And it's time that I just don't have right now.
[85:45.25]I have, like, a lot written, but it's not done, and it's not gonna be done for a while.
[85:51.07]And it's just something that's gonna have to sit as a side project, like a super side project.
[85:56.67]But one of these days, before- I'm never gonna get that money now.
[86:00.67]Before I die, I'm going to release, uh, my book.
[86:09.17]Camera down there.
[86:12.87]Is there any machines in here?
[86:16.53]Yeah, writing, it's like a full, those of you guys that have, like, written, that, like, have written books before, seriously, like, you get a lot of respect from me.
[86:24.44]Because it's a fucking lot of work.
[86:25.92]It's a lot of time.
[86:27.52]Especially if you're doing it kind of by yourself, and you don't have, like, some editor or some person that's, like, working with you.
[86:33.19]It can seriously be a lot of time.
[86:35.69]Like, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, thousands, thousands of hours of time.
[86:40.45]I'm not going to jump into this guy.
[86:43.98]There's nothing even over here, is there?
[86:45.44]No.
[86:46.06]I don't even need to be doing this.
[86:47.34]Just want to make sure there's not going to grab me right here.
[87:03.80]Shit.
[87:11.19]You just have to do whatever you're going to do, you know?
[87:17.78]I thought I was going to be able to do it, but I was totally 100% wrong.
[87:21.72]At least for the time being.
[87:29.30]I think I've royally fucked myself.
[87:32.74]Because I have to jump back over here.
[87:36.60]Yeah.
[87:38.60]Yeah, I'm screwed.
[87:41.65]Yeah, how am I going to make it back?
[87:47.05]Is there like a... Is there a get me out of here button?
[87:53.05]Where's the hitbox?
[87:53.77]Is the hitbox right here?
[87:55.73]If the hitbox is on the other side of him, then maybe that'll be... Okay.
[88:03.92]I just have to try, right?
[88:05.98]I gotta do a perfect double jump.
[88:11.30]Don't... Please don't, uh...
[88:13.78]Please don't laugh at me if I screw this up.
[88:16.14]But I'm not gonna screw it up.
[88:17.42]I'm gonna build up my confidence level.
[88:18.96]Hold on.
[88:21.14]I'm dead.
[88:21.54]There's no way I was gonna get over that.
[88:23.63]There's no fucking way.
[88:25.79]There's no way I was gonna do that.
[88:32.05]Even if I did, that was a pretty good double jump, in my opinion.
[88:38.02]What the hell?
[88:55.85]I blew up by the fucking line.
[89:05.22]God, I'm so absent-minded.
[89:06.61]I really am.
[89:08.57]I was thinking about, like, Doritos right there.
[89:11.57]Right when I was about to open that door, I was like, you know, I kind of want some Doritos, and I walked into the guy.
[89:17.76]Fucking really...
[89:20.62]Forget about fucking Doritos.
[89:22.04]You don't have them.
[89:23.86]You can't go to the store right now and get them.
[89:25.60]Why would you be thinking about Doritos?
[89:27.34]Stop doing that.
[89:28.64]Play the swindle.
[89:32.26]You motherfucker.
[89:39.72]It's gonna be hard to do.
[89:41.08]I gotta wait till he comes around the corner like that.
[89:43.50]And yoink.
[89:44.24]And let's just keep going.
[90:02.91]No Here we go No No Here we go No No
[90:23.17]Stop streaming and buy some Doritos.
[90:25.19]See?
[90:25.61]I talked about Doritos again.
[90:27.27]You mute, you made me talk about Doritos again and I almost just jumped into that guy's fucking beam.
[90:33.84]What is that guy doing?
[90:34.52]Get up here.
[90:40.34]Oh god, this is just awkwardly happening.
[90:43.32]Here we go, I can kill him here.
[90:45.24]Alright, thank god.
[90:48.60]Turn around, man.
[91:00.27]He's a gamer fuel.
[91:06.85]I thought that guy was still alive.
[91:07.73]He was, like, standing up on the door.
[91:10.95]Well, that's a... not a room I want to be in.
[91:13.71]Okay, right down here.
[91:14.29]We're gonna go down here.
[91:14.83]We're gonna get that... device.
[91:17.95]And no, we're not, because the mine is right there.
[91:20.35]Shit.
[91:25.96]So... I gotta come from the left.
[91:30.27]Is there any reason for me to open this door and attack this guy?
[91:32.31]No, there's not.
[91:32.77]I don't know why I'm doing it.
[91:33.73]Why am I doing it?
[91:34.27]You know what I mean?
[91:36.11]Like, there's no reason for me to do this.
[91:37.27]Why am I doing this?
[91:37.87]Okay.
[91:39.75]We're okay.
[91:45.76]That guy's looking right at the door.
[92:00.22]We gotta get out of here now.
[92:02.40]Straight through.
[92:02.88]No, not straight through.
[92:06.56]There's no money behind that guy.
[92:07.46]Doesn't matter.
[92:08.56]Time to go.
[92:12.97]Let's get the hell out of here.
[92:16.51]No stopping.
[92:17.81]Just get in with the seven grand.
[92:21.23]Alright. 98%.
[92:28.36]I don't have the 20,000 that I need.
[92:29.78]So we're going to do another one.
[92:32.58]How much is it to get to the next level, I wonder?
[92:34.50]50,000?
[92:35.38]Let's find out.
[92:50.03]Where are we?
[92:50.53]Okay. 25,000.
[92:56.83]Yeah, that clock ringing, did that mean the night was over or something and they was going to shut it down?
[93:04.44]I wonder if that's what it means.
[93:05.28]Well, I'm sure it'll happen again.
[93:15.70]I'm pretty sure about that.
[93:22.06]Yeah, that was a successful trip.
[93:25.22]The first time in, like, 25 minutes.
[93:28.16]Look, let's do it again.
[93:30.38]Let's, like, get the hang of this and start to actually string together a couple of, like, 10 grand knights.
[93:36.83]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[93:38.09]Easy, easy, easy.
[93:38.81]What the fuck am I doing?
[93:40.95]You see what I just did?
[93:41.63]Can you believe that I just almost did that again?
[93:47.67]I cannot believe it.
[93:51.47]Almost fucking did it again.
[93:55.80]Uh, Steve the Duckling, good night to you as well.
[94:01.55]This is a busy room.
[94:03.73]That's a really busy room, I need to be careful.
[94:10.53]Hello.
[94:11.60]Is he coming over this way?
[94:16.36]I don't, I don't, this guy on the left doesn't seem to be coming over here, but, you know...
[94:28.75]Beautiful.
[94:32.71]Nothing up there that I really want to deal with.
[94:34.71]What about down?
[94:36.22]Let's go up.
[94:44.60]No, I don't want to go up there.
[94:47.55]We need to start utilizing this a little bit more better.
[94:50.11]A little bit more better.
[94:56.13]I don't think there's any more machines to hack.
[94:57.41]I think I got the only one in the level, right?
[95:00.09]Unless I'm seeing things incorrectly, which I very well could be.
[95:04.31]There's one down here, right?
[95:13.22]There we go!
[95:14.68]How do I get there?
[95:20.86]How the fuck do I get there?
[95:33.64]Fuck that guy.
[95:41.10]How do I get down there?
[95:45.81]The bombs, maybe?
[95:46.57]Yeah, probably the bombs.
[95:49.15]Unless, like, if you look at the top there, it looks like there's a way to... Like, the cross, maybe?
[95:55.94]Or did I just get totally screwed over by the procedurally generated level?
[96:02.18]That's probably what happened.
[96:03.84]I think that's a good enough indication where it's time to leave.
[96:06.48]Right?
[96:07.44]It's time to go.
[96:10.14]When you look at something like that, you pretty much have to leave.
[96:13.50]Except, actually, you have to go get that bag of money that's right there.
[96:17.44]Then you can leave.
[96:18.82]By all means, after that, you can leave whenever you want.
[96:23.29]Not until you get that bag of fucking beautiful green.
[96:31.73]I don't even care.
[96:32.19]Blow it up.
[96:33.62]Just blow it up.
[96:34.00]I don't even want to take the risk.
[96:34.90]I'm going to get this, and then we're going to go.
[96:41.50]Yeah.
[96:43.28]Bye.
[96:45.26]See you later.
[96:47.83]Goodbye.
[96:51.05]We're going to take the long way up around the whole building.
[96:54.43]Because if I could jump, that would be great.
[96:57.94]Because I want nothing to do
[97:01.06]I want nothing to do with that last bag of green crisp hundreds.
[97:20.75]Nothing to do with it.
[97:22.81]Nothing to do with it.
[97:23.81]Nothing to do with that bag of money.
[97:25.59]Nothing to do with it.
[97:33.33]Nothing to do with it.
[97:35.71]Nothing to do with it.
[97:37.03]Nothing to do with it.
[97:37.55]Nothing to do with it.
[97:47.25]And we're out.
[97:49.50]We are gone.
[97:50.58]We left.
[97:51.36]We're out of there.
[97:59.30]How much money do I have now?
[98:00.02]Total?
[98:01.30]Total?
[98:05.20]Run!
[98:05.86]13,000.
[98:11.23]Not a bad position to be in.
[98:15.81]I'm getting better.
[98:17.57]Getting better.
[98:21.53]I might have to get this to blow up, though.
[98:23.69]Unless I can do a double jump here.
[98:26.45]to check in.
[98:27.81]Easy!
[98:28.25]Easy!
[98:28.85]Easy, man!
[98:29.79]Easy!
[98:30.17]Stop that!
[98:31.12]Jeez, every time I get to a point where I think I'm gonna get caught, and then it scares me, so I try to flail everywhere.
[98:40.80]It's like, dude, that's not gonna help.
[98:41.92]Just stay calm.
[98:43.60]You don't have to leap in every direction.
[98:48.83]You're gonna cause yourself so many more problems.
[98:51.63]Does that swing down?
[98:55.35]No, it doesn't.
[99:03.84]swing up.
[99:07.46]Not really, but effective enough.
[99:13.41]You piece of shit.
[99:14.47]Come here.
[99:17.43]Ugh.
[99:18.53]I know I can get this guy.
[99:20.25]I would have had it.
[99:20.95]I can still get it.
[99:21.45]There we go.
[99:28.10]I've seemed to have gotten that down.
[99:29.98]Which is a good thing.
[99:32.32]What is it?
[99:32.66]Oh.
[99:34.12]Alright, there's no reason to go up.
[99:36.48]And there's really no reason to go right either.
[99:38.04]That's like a fucking tiny amount of money, right?
[99:42.36]That's like a... No, that's not worth it.
[99:43.56]That's such a small amount of money.
[99:45.48]What do I care if I 100% the level?
[99:46.46]Seriously.
[99:46.74]That's like $4.
[99:47.14]I tripped it.
[99:48.58]It's okay.
[99:57.01]We're learning.
[99:57.77]We are learning.
[99:58.83]Very much.
[99:59.69]Very much so.
[100:00.29]This room, this door cannot be opened.
[100:02.31]And there's no reason to open it.
[100:03.27]Because it's the security camera thing right there.
[100:04.69]There's no reason for me to do it.
[100:05.39]Let's just keep going.
[100:17.68]Hmm.
[100:22.14]The top room's the only room I'm really concerned about.
[100:26.58]How do I get to it?
[100:28.18]Reliably.
[100:31.08]Man, they have... In this level, seriously, there's like $4 that is guarded by so much crap that it's not even worth going to.
[100:36.90]I could probably get these two in one fall here.
[100:43.51]Once this guy turns and he goes that way... Mmm, this is... I know I'm gonna fall down and he's gonna show up, so it's not worth it.
[100:53.33]I have to wait for him to come back.
[100:56.37]And the light has to be pointing to the left.
[100:58.45]So.
[101:01.32]Like that.
[101:06.46]Call me a bad thief.
[101:07.52]Go ahead, try.
[101:08.18]Go ahead.
[101:09.86]Call me a fucking bad thief after that display.
[101:12.67]Come on now.
[101:23.75]That, like, seriously, that, like, seemed like that would have happened, like, on purpose, but it wasn't.
[101:27.57]Like, that's so fucking stupid.
[101:29.27]I am extremely upset right now.
[101:32.03]Because I didn't move, I did it right.
[101:40.69]Like, you know, like, that was, like, so, like, oh, that, like, was, oh, look at how good of a thief I am.
[101:44.49]Oh, now I blow up by this thing.
[101:45.82]So, like, funny, like, I just, I made, I faked that.
[101:49.62]Fucking dumbass.
[101:53.54]That's not what happened.
[101:55.40]I actually didn't do it.
[101:56.92]For some reason, it just doesn't work.
[101:59.44]I either somehow touched the analog in the wrong place.
[102:04.28]It must be something to do... It's the analog.
[102:05.92]It has to be.
[102:07.27]Right?
[102:09.31]Because if I'm hitting down, and I'm not hitting totally down, you know what I mean?
[102:12.63]Like, if I hit left a little bit or something, I gotta stop using the analog.
[102:15.35]I said that before, and I have to stop doing it.
[102:18.57]Yeah.
[102:19.03]Well, no more analog.
[102:19.66]Analog.
[102:21.63]It's causing me bad times.
[102:23.39]Pick it up.
[102:32.04]Yeah, there's no way to mess that up if you're using the D-pad.
[102:45.35]I got a lot of money right now.
[102:54.97]Give me a little bit of credit.
[102:55.85]That was like the first one I had messed up in like 40 minutes.
[102:58.83]You know what I mean?
[103:00.83]It ain't me, I swear.
[103:01.65]It's definitely me.
[103:07.33]I just need to not use the stick.
[103:20.02]Get out of there.
[103:28.99]There's another machine.
[103:30.23]I could get 10 grand out of this, guys.
[103:32.35]I'm not gonna leave.
[103:33.81]Especially with this one moron guarding it.
[103:35.67]Are you kidding me?
[103:38.47]All I gotta do is I gotta just make sure I hit this.
[103:41.67]And then fall.
[103:42.29]And I should be fine.
[103:43.83]Like... Boom.
[103:47.92]Boom.
[103:54.10]Almost 10 grand.
[103:58.72]It's okay.
[103:59.48]It's alright.
[103:59.76]We're okay.
[104:00.62]It don't matter.
[104:02.20]It don't matter.
[104:02.60]We're fine.
[104:03.40]I just don't... I don't remember where... Is it on the left or the right?
[104:05.80]Is it on the left or the right?
[104:07.36]The escape.
[104:08.48]I think it's the left.
[104:09.10]Yeah, it has to be the left.
[104:09.79]I'm good.
[104:12.63]Get me the hell out of here.
[104:13.59]It's on the fucking right.
[104:17.13]Of course it is.
[104:30.23]Thank God.
[104:32.09]Thank God.
[104:32.75]$22,000.
[104:36.11]Let's go see what I can do.
[104:43.78]Ooh, something right here.
[104:52.98]It's $18,000 just to be able to stick to Windows.
[105:00.49]I feel like that's going to be useful later, but not really right now.
[105:04.39]So, we're not going to do it.
[105:07.32]Here we go.
[105:08.02]This is the real deal.
[105:12.80]Security cameras cannot be turned off by those rooms.
[105:20.09]What does the last thing do?
[105:24.93]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[105:26.93]So I can hack people that I knock down and they become like on my team.
[105:32.79]I like it.
[105:40.06]Alright, let's go.
[105:45.02]Will I ever play Smite again?
[105:46.10]I don't know.
[105:49.40]I really don't know.
[105:51.94]That's the thing.
[105:52.88]I just do whatever, like, I kind of feel like doing.
[105:56.36]And sometimes, you know, it might be... TF2.
[106:00.73]Sometimes it might be Smite.
[106:02.91]Might be, like, some dumb random game.
[106:04.45]Sometimes it might be The Swindle.
[106:07.34]Check it out on Steam!
[106:23.33]Much better.
[106:25.63]Much better.
[106:28.85]Put a lot of fucking mines here, huh?
[106:31.09]Alright, hold on a second.
[106:35.85]Am I crazy?
[106:37.21]Tell me if I'm crazy.
[106:38.98]Do some of those mines sometimes like look shakier and louder?
[106:43.36]Or is that just my imagination?
[106:44.48]You know what I mean?
[106:46.82]Sometimes do those mines have like big shaky letters?
[106:54.81]Oh, good.
[106:55.09]I can go down there and turn off cameras.
[106:56.21]Let me do that.
[107:03.31]This area sucked.
[107:04.07]It was like $1 here.
[107:06.33]Is that seriously all I can do here?
[107:08.43]I guess so.
[107:20.99]Not today.
[107:22.57]Not today.
[107:27.42]into walls too easily.
[107:28.38]Is he dead?
[107:35.22]He is.
[107:45.25]All that for one bag of $72.
[107:46.65]Not really worth it, but whatever.
[107:57.00]That room's not terrible.
[107:57.90]If I turn the cameras off, that room is easy.
[107:59.75]I need to get down to that room downstairs.
[108:29.19]Beautiful.
[108:34.33]A lot of hacking.
[108:39.83]And a lot of fucking mines, man.
[108:41.31]I don't like the mines at all.
[108:47.68]Float back over here.
[108:48.44]Okay, I gotta be careful down there.
[108:55.70]Float down here.
[108:58.51]Get in my range.
[109:03.65]Yes!
[109:06.77]Is it 6 a.m.
[109:07.47]for me?
[109:07.75]Yeah, probably.
[109:09.45]Yeah, it probably is 6 a.m.
[109:12.17]But, you know, sometimes you gotta swindle.
[109:15.09]Sometimes you gotta do sleep.
[109:20.18]Where was that camera room?
[109:21.14]Down here somewhere.
[109:28.81]Was it on the other side?
[109:29.47]I feel like it was on the left.
[109:31.05]Probably.
[109:31.43]I wonder what's down.
[109:42.76]It's over there to the left.
[109:44.42]Shit.
[109:44.72]How do I get over there?
[109:48.56]From the left over there?
[109:49.70]Was there a way I could go over there?
[109:50.90]There's definitely not a way I can go down here, right?
[109:54.28]No.
[109:55.91]No.
[109:56.69]Screw this room.
[109:57.39]Forget that.
[109:59.87]I gotta go left.
[110:02.69]But how the hell do I do that?
[110:08.63]Well, you can't swindle in your sleep, so that's what you mean.
[110:10.75]You can't really do that.
[110:13.78]Do you read my message?
[110:14.76]Yeah, Mr. Steph, I'm reading it right now.
[110:19.42]Need explosives?
[110:20.80]Damn it.
[110:22.36]That would explain it now, wouldn't it?
[110:26.62]Yeah.
[110:27.14]I don't think I can get in there.
[110:27.99]I
[110:33.57]Oh well.
[110:35.01]We're going to leave.
[110:37.71]Save ourselves the trouble and get bombs?
[110:40.25]I think I have enough bombs.
[110:46.86]I'm pretty sure I've been able to get bombs for a while now and just haven't done it for some reason.
[110:50.06]I don't know why.
[110:51.40]Yeah.
[110:53.70]3,000.
[110:54.74]Yeah, give me some bombs.
[110:57.01]Three bombs.
[110:59.35]Let's go see how they are.
[111:00.63]Let's check it out.
[111:13.90]Oh, why can't we donate?
[111:15.63]Maximum what says I'd give you a couple bucks?
[111:19.11]Um... Because I'm not a real streamer yet.
[111:22.93]This isn't a real stream.
[111:23.93]This is a fake stream.
[111:26.29]And I don't even know.
[111:26.97]I don't even know if I'm gonna do donations.
[111:28.89]I don't even know if I'm gonna do that.
[111:30.91]I might not even do that.
[111:34.63]Hold right trigger to open your toolkit.
[111:36.52]Select bombs.
[111:38.48]Press B to... I was reading it and I didn't even see.
[111:40.82]So is it press B, right?
[111:43.02]Okay.
[111:45.21]Does that... Do I have to, like... Okay, I don't know.
[111:50.86]I've never used this before.
[111:51.86]I'm gonna just see what happens, because I don't want to do it.
[111:54.44]I don't want to do this one time and have it kill me.
[111:57.98]So it takes a while to do.
[112:03.18]Alright.
[112:04.37]And I have three of them.
[112:06.89]Okay, cool.
[112:08.23]You know... Alright.
[112:09.27]Okay, you know what?
[112:09.83]Let's just go.
[112:10.27]Let's bypass that whole room with our bombs.
[112:15.61]Who needs to open doors when you can just blow them up?
[112:19.45]And then, like, take this.
[112:21.95]And, like, never be seen, ever.
[112:28.61]Alright, that was a bomb tutorial that I just did.
[112:33.51]You can cancel it with me again.
[112:34.53]Okay, that's cool.
[112:38.52]Sometimes you don't need to kill.
[112:40.30]I feel like I'm gonna trip this if I get too... Holy shit, that guy scared me.
[112:58.93]I can just keep this guy stunned a lot.
[113:00.21]There we go.
[113:03.72]Ooh, why did that slow-mo?
[113:05.38]Did I get too close?
[113:12.56]Whoa, that's a camera.
[113:26.77]Move.
[113:30.06]Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.
[113:33.20]Now I gotta fall down there and I gotta stunlock that guy.
[113:34.93]Actually, maybe I should fall down there and open the door.
[113:38.23]Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
[113:39.53]Fall down, open the door, jump over his head.
[113:44.77]No, fuck that.
[113:45.19]We're gonna stunlock him.
[113:46.73]Stunlock.
[113:50.56]What?
[113:50.82]I was trying to avoid it.
[113:51.64]I was trying to avoid it and I hit it.
[113:53.40]You saw what I did.
[113:54.40]I was trying to get out of line of sight.
[114:03.57]It's okay.
[114:04.51]It's okay.
[114:04.85]We're good.
[114:06.27]This was a bomb trial run anyways.
[114:07.67]I just wasted two bombs and we can get out of here.
[114:10.51]Nope, we're going out the other side.
[114:11.75]Get me out.
[114:16.24]I was trying to get out of line of sight from that damn thing too.
[114:18.48]And I ended up messing myself over.
[114:20.00]I don't know how much longer the police are going to be delayed.
[114:31.52]It's alright.
[114:34.98]Have I just woken up and started streaming or did I stay up all night?
[114:37.76]I have not gone to bed.
[114:42.10]I have not slept, which is kind of pretty usual at this point.
[114:46.26]I usually stay up pretty late.
[114:49.83]But actually, there's another reason why I'm awake still.
[114:55.01]I have a lot of stuff to do at the place.
[114:58.43]And I'm one of those people where if I don't get a good six hours of sleep, then I just shouldn't go to bed to begin with.
[115:08.58]So I'm one of those people, if I get like two hours of sleep, my whole body weighs like 700 pounds.
[115:16.08]And I just can't function as a human being.
[115:22.15]I'm going to do this.
[115:22.81]I feel like this invisibility cloak thing is a really good idea.
[115:32.65]Yeah, in a sense, I'm going to... There'll be all that stuff.
[115:35.22]There'll be... Chat rules and all kinds of... Link to my YouTube.
[115:42.06]This is just... I'm just doing this for fun.
[115:46.78]I'm not really prepared to have a full-time stream...
[115:53.29]I will be soon.
[115:55.39]But at no time am I ever going to have a legit streaming schedule.
[116:01.55]Because every time I've tried to do that... Hold on, I need to read this.
[116:08.07]Okay.
[116:09.97]So, same deal.
[116:10.45]I just have to activate it like this.
[116:12.74]And... I have three seconds.
[116:16.72]Three seconds of... And it recharges just like an invisibility watch.
[116:20.18]Cool.
[116:20.40]Cool.
[116:21.73]That's extremely slow recharge.
[116:24.91]But yeah, every time I've done a streaming schedule, it's been a disaster.
[116:29.19]It's been a disaster.
[116:30.25]Every time.
[116:33.61]I never do it.
[116:35.35]It's almost like I have to force myself to get up and do it and stuff.
[116:38.73]Oh, I'm going to stream every day at like 3 o'clock Eastern Time.
[116:42.63]Or every Saturday and Sunday.
[116:43.89]It never works out.
[116:44.69]Ever.
[116:45.85]So what I've decided to do is just whenever I kind of just feel like doing it, at least a few times a week, I'm going to do it.
[116:55.29]Putting a schedule on it, and the same thing with my YouTube channel, putting a schedule and, like, a certain upload frequency or, you know, just fucks with me.
[117:04.19]And it makes it so I don't make videos, I don't make streams that I want to do.
[117:09.04]So I just don't do that.
[117:10.90]I just do things when I get an idea or when something I want to do.
[117:14.42]If I record something and it's like, okay, that turned out alright, you know, it's just, that's when it goes up.
[117:20.28]And that's the way it's just gonna be.
[117:24.33]I'm just not good with schedules at all.
[117:29.95]God, just get it over with and do it.
[117:31.15]God, I'm like running back and forth to the damn thing.
[117:40.08]Yep.
[117:40.56]See, he would have just caught me right there.
[117:44.88]It's not worth it, I don't think.
[117:45.91]Unless that leads up, it does.
[117:47.59]But we're...
[118:00.12]Nice.
[118:05.58]Now, is this on a timer?
[118:10.40]I wonder if that's on a timer.
[118:13.93]Did that disable everything?
[118:16.33]There was a guy just flying around right here.
[118:20.79]I think that may have disabled all the bots that can fly around too.
[118:25.77]Wow, that is really, really good.
[118:39.59]Is there room over there?
[118:40.77]Can I get up that way?
[118:42.89]If I fall, he's in a weird spot.
[118:44.46]If I fall right now, is that going to think that I'm jumping?
[118:48.88]Like if I touch him right here and I'm falling?
[118:51.24]Does the game dictate that you're actually going to fall and you're going to land on this guy?
[119:00.00]I don't know.
[119:00.76]Oh, that's a terrible idea.
[119:01.68]Why would I do that?
[119:02.42]I'm going to fall in the room full of people right there.
[119:10.09]How old is this game?
[119:10.95]It just came out like a week or two ago, I think.
[119:14.01]It's pretty new.
[119:15.62]Fuck this whole area.
[119:16.58]I'm just gonna go... Can I go around?
[119:20.58]I can go this way.
[119:22.70]Leads to nowhere.
[119:23.88]Oh, wait a minute.
[119:24.66]Wait a minute.
[119:25.34]Wait just a second here.
[119:26.54]I got bombs.
[119:30.52]I got bombs, guys.
[119:34.12]Oh, no.
[119:36.30]Star is here.
[119:38.74]Great.
[119:43.68]Okay, confirmed.
[119:45.54]I wanted just to make sure that was a thing.
[119:49.40]Where is that guy?
[119:51.48]I should have killed the slug guy.
[119:52.46]No, I should have.
[119:52.88]Where the hell is he?
[119:56.21]Well... Forget it.
[119:59.05]We're just going to jump over.
[119:59.77]Because I have bombs, I can... Is there anything I can even do over here?
[120:08.15]I don't think so.
[120:11.78]Wow, forgot.
[120:12.78]Wow!
[120:15.79]You know what?
[120:16.13]I just gotta get rid of this.
[120:16.75]I don't want to have to deal with that again.
[120:23.93]Maybe I should go all the way around?
[120:25.19]That's the only thing I can think of, right?
[120:27.39]Yeah, I guess so.
[120:31.69]That's an easy, like, five bucks right there.
[120:33.39]Get the fuck out of my way.
[120:46.51]Alright.
[120:47.75]Let me think about this for a second, because... No, I don't want to go that way.
[120:55.53]I only have three bombs.
[120:57.54]Should I just fucking... Oh, right here.
[120:59.24]I'm just gonna bomb right here, you know what I mean?
[121:00.94]No, that's dumb.
[121:04.20]Because I turned off all this shit.
[121:06.50]I'll just have to hack these and I'll be fine.
[121:07.89]I want to... The door's open!
[121:12.77]Why do I
[121:16.40]I'm up.
[121:17.36]Okay, whatever.
[121:31.59]After this, we're out of here.
[121:33.77]We're so out of here after this.
[121:34.73]Yeah, we're done.
[121:35.51]See you later.
[121:38.92]Unless there's something I was missing, which I don't think there is.
[121:47.43]For the sake of it, maybe I should just try to... This is very not dangerous.
[121:50.85]I'm just going to go for the 100%.
[121:51.60]There was that there, and there was one more down here.
[122:00.04]I know everyone's going to freak out and say this is a terrible idea.
[122:02.14]I know it is.
[122:03.80]I'm aware.
[122:06.11]But sometimes you have to do the dumb shit idea to get the 100%.
[122:09.29]On a stream, you know what I mean?
[122:12.37]Like stream time.
[122:15.55]Yeah, that's the last buck right there.
[122:19.47]Last fucking dollar.
[122:20.67]Give it to me.
[122:24.39]Okay, perfect world here, guys, is I bounce him off the wall and he falls on the spike.
[122:33.73]Um, no.
[122:34.55]Never mind.
[122:34.91]We can't get it.
[122:35.91]There's no way I'm gonna get it.
[122:36.79]Unless, hold on a second.
[122:38.51]Bombs?
[122:40.13]Alright, what if I drop a bomb down here?
[122:41.55]You know what I mean?
[122:43.47]Like, drop it down here.
[122:45.51]Can I, like, just drop it here?
[122:47.68]Will that, like, fall down?
[122:51.82]No, it won't.
[122:57.74]Go!
[123:01.22]Holy fuck.
[123:05.02]I thought I had a double jump!
[123:06.11]I thought I had a fucking double jump!
[123:10.07]Where was my double jump?
[123:13.17]Where was the double jump?
[123:14.61]I didn't do a double jump.
[123:15.57]I jumped off the wall and jumped again.
[123:18.47]Where was the double jump?
[123:23.38]Gotta be kidding me.
[123:24.54]Where was the double jump?
[123:28.94]Where was the fucking... No, I have double jump.
[123:43.19]Look.
[123:44.11]Look, I promise.
[123:44.84]I promise I have double jump.
[123:47.14]See?
[123:47.92]It's the first one.
[123:49.16]It's the first thing on this list.
[123:53.15]I can't move.
[123:57.26]Look, ready?
[123:57.64]I'll prove it to you.
[123:58.84]See?
[124:00.78]I have a double jump.
[124:02.12]Does it count?
[124:02.78]You know what?
[124:03.16]It must count, like, the jump to the ceiling, or the wall, grabbing onto the wall, must, like, you can't do a, like, that's like, oh, it saves your one jump.
[124:16.03]I'm gonna do some hypothesis scientific investigation here, because if that's the case, then I need to remember that.
[124:20.90]Let's see.
[124:24.68]Ready?
[124:24.90]Alright, so I'm, okay, right now, I'm on a wall right now.
[124:28.07]Stuck on a wall.
[124:30.19]What the fuck?
[124:31.33]No way!
[124:34.43]There's no fucking way!
[124:35.35]There's no way!
[124:37.27]There's no fucking way!
[124:38.71]I refuse to believe it.
[124:42.82]I refuse to believe it.
[124:58.04]I might be really too close for this.
[124:59.86]No, we're fine.
[125:05.87]That's an awkward situation to be in.
[125:10.13]Stunlock.
[125:11.08]Get out of here.
[125:21.01]Thank you.
[125:26.17]Double jump, okay.
[125:27.29]Yeah, maybe that's double jump onto a wall.
[125:30.61]Yeah, you were right.
[125:32.18]You were right.
[125:33.48]I didn't see your name in the chat, but yep, that is what's happening.
[125:38.06]If you double jump into a wall...
[125:41.00]I need to jump off?
[125:42.74]Nope.
[125:43.14]Yep.
[125:43.52]That's exactly what it is.
[125:44.96]I can jump on a wall and then double jump off the wall, but if I double jump into a wall, nope, I can no longer double jump.
[125:52.88]Wait, what the fuck was that?
[125:54.22]I just did.
[125:54.60]Hold on.
[125:58.70]No.
[125:59.22]Maybe that was weird, but it definitely doesn't work.
[126:02.00]Duly noted.
[126:03.93]Absolutely duly noted.
[126:07.13]I just did it at the very last one.
[126:08.51]I was, like, almost to the ground, though.
[126:10.07]Whatever.
[126:11.27]Just remember, don't double jump.
[126:12.71]If you double jump at a wall, don't fucking double jump again.
[126:14.67]Dummy.
[126:16.85]Don't be a dummy, Jerma.
[126:18.63]Come on, now.
[126:36.77]Couple of spike guys.
[126:38.87]Is there a little shit hiding in there too?
[126:40.63]I feel like there is.
[126:41.17]One of those little crap, crap trap.
[126:44.87]Clap trap.
[126:49.52]Maybe not.
[126:49.82]I think they're just being weird.
[126:51.50]Are they?
[126:54.94]Yeah, they are.
[127:03.10]What's down?
[127:09.32]I don't think I can get down there.
[127:14.48]Actually, you know what?
[127:15.04]I think I missed something down here.
[127:18.54]No.
[127:21.02]I mean, is it worth... I don't think I have enough bombs to get in there.
[127:25.66]Why is there a door right here?
[127:28.47]It's just random generated door.
[127:30.11]That's funny.
[127:40.26]That's locked.
[127:43.52]Okay, there's a locked one?
[127:48.98]Now if I... This is a good place for a bomb.
[127:51.30]I think.
[127:52.06]Because if I do bomb, right?
[127:54.80]Put it down right here.
[127:58.00]It's gonna take two bombs, regardless of where I put it.
[128:03.02]Get into this room.
[128:05.32]Hope I don't blow up this fucking thing.
[128:06.96]I've probably been going to, but I hope I don't.
[128:09.81]Don't blow up the terminal.
[128:11.37]Just get down here so you can blow up the bottom, so then you can turn off the terminal and be able to mine the ore that's inside of it.
[128:20.70]Okay, we're in a good spot here, I think.
[128:25.36]Bomb needs to go down there, in that little area.
[128:27.58]Oh, I can hack this computer.
[128:32.66]Why is it so- why is it red?
[128:38.89]Oh.
[128:39.63]Oh, okay.
[128:40.53]Oh, shit.
[128:42.53]That's why.
[128:43.07]That's why it's red.
[128:46.18]I got enough money.
[128:46.72]I'm getting out of here.
[128:48.96]Goodbye.
[128:53.92]Yeah.
[128:54.44]Red terminals activate the police, so I think either you have to do those last, or you have to turn off the security cameras to do them.
[129:05.47]I'm on day 50, by the way.
[129:07.55]So, shit.
[129:13.34]$7,000?
[129:13.36]No.
[129:14.34]I'm not even going to look at that list until I get $15,000 to $20,000.
[129:20.44]So, I'm at the halfway point of the days.
[129:22.66]No, no, no.
[129:24.70]$45,000 will be the halfway point.
[129:27.24]If I'm not here in Casino Town by day 45, that means halfway.
[129:33.67]There's no chance in hell I'm going to complete this game in 90 days.
[129:40.22]You know what I mean?
[129:40.74]I gotta get here by 45.
[129:42.58]I'm at 50 right now.
[129:44.30]I have five days.
[130:02.26]Let's just go.
[130:04.70]Let's just go back to the... No, wait a minute.
[130:07.95]I was wrong.
[130:09.75]I'm not on two.
[130:10.77]I'm on one still.
[130:11.78]No, this is over.
[130:12.48]There's no way I'm gonna be able to beat this game.
[130:15.92]I've gotta do some really wacky shit to be able to do this.
[130:28.13]Didn't even see that guy.
[130:28.81]They blended with the wall.
[130:29.49]Look at how much they blended with the wall.
[130:30.87]I thought that guy was a piece of machinery.
[130:34.03]No, he's just a shithead.
[130:34.97]I just hate those little things.
[130:37.60]There's another one right here.
[130:38.96]They're trying to pretend like he's a mine.
[130:40.54]Fuck, man.
[130:52.03]Break the window up around the side.
[130:53.69]Let's go.
[130:57.57]So far, so good.
[131:01.97]They can see through windows, so I gotta, yeah, I gotta be careful.
[131:04.41]He can see through windows.
[131:10.49]Need to speedrun this game?
[131:12.65]No way.
[131:15.18]Maybe somebody else, maybe somebody else more talented than me can speedrun this game.
[131:20.64]Yeah, I'm gonna call this a not worth it, and we're gonna... No, we're not.
[131:26.36]Shit.
[131:26.48]I'm gonna go back around.
[131:31.19]This is the safe route.
[131:33.47]We're gonna do the safe route because I don't want to die or lose.
[131:40.05]Is he dead?
[131:52.35]He's dead, right?
[131:52.95]Good.
[131:57.57]Very good.
[132:02.71]What's down?
[132:04.27]Security room.
[132:09.68]I think I might just Bob my way down here.
[132:11.24]One, two, three, right?
[132:12.14]Yeah, I got it.
[132:15.00]I can do it.
[132:23.11]One bomb down.
[132:28.64]Two bombs down.
[132:34.23]and three bombs down let's see what's down here and I might not have even needed to do this but I didn't feel like going around the entire zone let's take a look that's actually a pretty good shortcut unless I like get touched by one of these guys is anything else down those guys don't die from the spikes of course they do good
[133:03.91]Wow!
[133:04.55]I didn't even fucking realize that was there.
[133:12.68]Everybody shut off.
[133:18.55]This'll be tricky.
[133:34.54]It might be time to go.
[133:36.08]I don't think there's much else for me to do.
[133:42.44]Yeah, it's time to go.
[133:44.62]Goodbye.
[133:48.03]Unless there's anything in here that I didn't see.
[133:49.91]Let's just take a quick look.
[134:01.43]Hmm...
[134:06.11]No, there's nothing in here.
[134:09.37]Oh, no, there's a terminal up there.
[134:11.49]There's a terminal up there.
[134:12.97]I'm gonna get it.
[134:15.41]I'm gonna get it.
[134:17.11]Stunlock this guy.
[134:18.89]Damn it, he went away.
[134:19.67]It's okay, when he comes back, I'll get him.
[134:22.64]I'll be able to two birds with one stone these two assholes.
[134:25.62]Watch this.
[134:29.12]I'm gonna do it again.
[134:30.16]Three birds with one stone.
[134:34.32]Perfect.
[134:36.14]There's three birds with three stones.
[134:37.28]But you know what?
[134:37.86]I don't even care.
[134:38.34]Trigger.
[134:38.62]I'm not going to even take a second to do that.
[134:45.19]Hmm.
[134:51.50]Don't one-hit kill me.
[134:52.48]Don't one-hit kill me.
[135:07.54]Other side, other side!
[135:09.40]Go!
[135:13.30]No, no, no, no.
[135:19.40]Other side, other side.
[135:21.84]Don't fall to your death either, holy shit, that'd be bad.
[135:25.14]Damn it!
[135:26.88]Damn it!
[135:30.96]It was the other side.
[135:32.14]Fuck, man.
[135:39.68]If all I'd only known was the other side, that would've been fine.
[135:44.54]That was good, too.
[135:45.18]That was 9,000 fucking dollars.
[135:46.66]That was 9 grand.
[135:48.46]Come on, now.
[135:49.63]Give me a break.
[135:50.39]Give me, give me, give me, give me a break.
[135:59.23]Fuck.
[135:59.51]I don't have any...
[136:07.22]I get too... See, now that was my fault.
[136:09.78]Okay, one thing I have to do, seriously.
[136:12.88]It's on the right fucking side of the level.
[136:16.88]Okay?
[136:17.74]Right, right, right.
[136:19.65]I gotta remember that.
[136:20.47]That's really important.
[136:40.82]I'll freak out.
[136:52.99]I don't want to deal with that guy.
[136:54.43]Don't even want to deal with him.
[136:55.21]I don't even give a shit.
[137:00.57]I don't think I give a fuck right now.
[137:04.73]Bring him on.
[137:05.86]I'll fight every guy that comes in here.
[137:08.22]I'm getting out of this.
[137:09.00]And I'm getting out of here with like five grand.
[137:12.33]Oh, I need a bomb for that.
[137:15.35]Oh, that guy's gonna come.
[137:16.05]That guy's gonna machine gun.
[137:20.57]God damn it.
[137:21.29]This game is fucking hard.
[137:22.69]I have no patience for this.
[137:36.30]I have no patience.
[137:40.20]See, now I'm rushing.
[137:41.88]I got mad that I lost a $9,000 run.
[137:44.02]And I'm just rushing and I'm irritated and mad and pissed off.
[138:04.06]I'll do the safe strategy.
[138:05.40]Actually, I could probably just detonate this.
[138:09.94]No, that's a bad idea.
[138:18.82]Come on, bring it on.
[138:27.74]Fuck you.
[138:29.86]Not this time.
[138:35.63]No.
[138:35.81]I'm not going to go down there.
[138:37.45]That's stupid.
[138:42.94]Give me this.
[138:45.68]Smash the glass.
[138:46.58]I don't want to get seen through the wall.
[138:57.21]Break the glass here, too.
[138:58.03]I have a better option to hit him when he comes over here.
[139:14.45]That was extremely risky.
[139:15.57]I should not have done that.
[139:16.27]That was a really stupid idea.
[139:18.25]But it worked out.
[139:27.71]Oh, I hit him once and he almost killed me.
[139:33.32]Not leaving any chance here.
[139:35.52]I need to get like a $10,000 run here.
[139:37.92]That's extremely important.
[139:39.22]Extremely important.
[139:45.26]Okay, I did that.
[139:46.56]Down there.
[139:46.98]I gotta go down here.
[139:51.55]Uh, looks like a bomb.
[139:53.99]How the hell am I gonna get past this?
[139:55.41]Seriously, this is like a... This is a death trap, bro.
[139:58.69]And I can't leave with 500 fucking dollars.
[140:00.74]Are you serious?
[140:03.92]Uh, you know what?
[140:06.00]Fuck all of you guys.
[140:09.56]Oh, what's that?
[140:10.74]Indivisibility cloak!
[140:37.30]I really thought that was gonna work.
[140:50.03]Invisi- okay, note to self, invisibility cloak does not make you invincible.
[140:55.93]That was a shit run anyways, who cares.
[140:57.37]I wasn't gonna do that, but that was- there was nothing for me to grab anyway.
[141:11.57]Now I'm, like, fucking laughing.
[141:12.86]I can't, like, play right now.
[141:18.32]Fuck.
[141:19.64]No, give me... The guy's got a gun!
[141:27.72]He's coming over with a gun!
[141:35.02]27.
[141:35.04]2700, we're good.
[141:38.08]At least I'm gonna leave with 2700.
[141:50.37]I broke 10 grand.
[141:53.49]I'm gonna play the shit out of this game, man.
[141:54.98]This game is fucking fun.
[141:58.30]This game is fun, because it's, like, very difficult.
[142:02.24]And it just gets inside of your head really easily.
[142:06.22]My face is gonna trip this.
[142:09.60]Apparently not.
[142:11.90]I'm not comfortable with that at all.
[142:13.06]I'm just gonna blow it.
[142:22.78]Speaking of blowing things.
[142:27.22]Forget the room downstairs.
[142:28.34]There's a camera down there.
[142:29.30]I'm gonna end the 90 days poorer than when you started.
[142:35.14]That really might be the case.
[142:38.42]What?
[142:38.90]What the fuck?
[142:39.24]What are you talking about?
[142:40.10]What?
[142:40.30]What?
[142:40.50]My bank account is being leeched.
[142:41.62]Head to the roof to disable it.
[142:43.84]Give me my money!
[142:44.40]What are you doing?
[142:45.90]What's going on?
[142:48.16]Who the fuck are you?
[142:49.60]Get the fuck out of here!
[142:52.93]Since when is that a thing?
[142:56.85]So now they have enemies that steal your money from your bank account?
[143:01.51]Little, like, professor fucking... That's new.
[143:10.66]Yeah, so if I lose this, I actually lost money by playing it.
[143:14.48]Because of that.
[143:14.96]I lost, like, $19.
[143:23.26]Yeah, I just got counter burgled mute.
[143:25.16]Counter burgled.
[143:38.45]I gotta time that better.
[143:39.51]I gotta get that down.
[143:43.12]Anything in this room worth... No.
[143:45.10]There's one dollar in that room.
[143:46.38]With a camera and shit?
[143:47.38]No way.
[143:47.58]Get out of town.
[143:54.47]Alright, he's gonna die.
[143:55.33]He'll jump up and he'll die from the spike as much.
[143:59.71]Good, he's dead.
[144:03.39]Camera, see you later.
[144:08.80]Is there nothing else in here?
[144:09.82]What the hell is in here?
[144:12.26]There's nothing else even fucking in here.
[144:17.38]Is this whole level just procedurally generated and nothing in here and a guy takes your money?
[144:23.41]What the hell is going on here?
[144:27.65]Yeah, there's nothing in here.
[144:30.33]Strange.
[144:31.73]Unless I missed something.
[144:34.21]Alright.
[144:39.59]Did I not go down this way?
[144:46.42]No, there's nothing here.
[144:47.90]Plus I died from the fall.
[144:49.24]That doesn't even matter.
[144:49.88]I don't even care.
[144:51.40]I'm actually glad to refresh this.
[144:57.37]Alright, hold on.
[144:57.79]I need to get, like, a drink.
[144:59.17]I need to, like, get a drink and refresh.
[145:00.87]I'll be back in, like... I'll be back in, like, two minutes or something.
[145:05.43]I don't know.
[145:06.15]Maybe, like, 60 seconds.
[145:07.42]I don't know.
[145:07.76]You'll see.
[145:08.86]We'll all see.
[147:12.08]Okay, hold on.
[147:12.94]I got a drink.
[147:21.44]So, the cool thing about this game, really, is the fact that this has been the first time I've actually put, like, any time into it.
[147:28.65]Like, I mean any.
[147:30.01]Like, this two-hour long stream is, like, blind me playing the game.
[147:35.91]I want to, like, go back, like, after I, like, try to get better at the game and shit, and, like, actually try to beat this game.
[147:42.61]Because this just, like, seems like it'd be really fun.
[147:47.35]No more, like, I've noticed I haven't done, like, a mind mistake in a while.
[147:56.36]And, you know what?
[147:57.24]Every time I fucking say a goddamn word about anything, it ends up, like, blowing up in my face.
[148:03.40]Is it liquor?
[148:04.04]No, it's not liquor.
[148:05.46]It is.
[148:07.08]It's grape cranberry juice.
[148:08.22]It's pretty good.
[148:14.00]Yeah, your character changes every time you die.
[148:15.78]And cool... Interestingly enough, it actually counts how many... It counts how many... Times you've done a successful heist with that character.
[148:31.23]So for me it's been like one because I die like every other time and like I'm on like an eight losing streak right now.
[148:37.25]I need to go to like bed.
[148:40.86]I have like a bunch of cavities in my brain.
[148:47.20]If I went to like a brain dentist they'd be like oh my goodness Trevor you have like six brain cavities.
[148:53.80]There's nothing we can do about them.
[148:56.34]Unless we drill inside your head with a drill.
[149:00.10]Those are there forever.
[149:03.40]I'm gonna go this way.
[149:12.46]Let the liquor do the trick.
[149:14.36]If you tell me you want me to, like, drink right now, you think this is, like, me, like, not playing well?
[149:20.88]If I had, like, a couple of drinks, are you serious?
[149:24.23]I wouldn't be able to, like, get past the main menu, let alone attempt to play this game.
[149:28.69]I actually came to a pretty good spot with this door.
[149:36.03]Because now everything turns off.
[149:36.87]And this should go smoothly.
[149:38.31]It should.
[149:38.61]At least I hope it does.
[149:41.13]There we go.
[149:43.77]Nice.
[149:45.44]Watch out for the window.
[149:46.22]They can see through the windows.
[149:51.82]Watch out.
[149:57.82]Jump over here.
[150:01.65]Forget about the mine.
[150:02.35]It's not worth it.
[150:09.90]Can we break this, like, eight losing streak I have here?
[150:14.98]Can he touch me through the window?
[150:15.86]Probably.
[150:16.46]Don't even want to chance it.
[150:17.30]I don't know.
[150:29.11]Maybe in... Did I... I didn't go down all the way down, right?
[150:35.05]Uh... Well, if there's any time for a bomb, it's right now.
[150:41.95]Just going to jump out of the way in time.
[150:49.81]One.
[150:52.07]And two.
[150:54.74]Oh shit, I didn't realize this was going to be hard to get away from this.
[151:00.66]That could have gone pretty poorly.
[151:06.07]One more jump.
[151:08.71]I got another bomb.
[151:09.27]I can drop right down here and get that back and then get out of here.
[151:14.79]Don't forget the mine.
[151:22.42]That's not a very good spot.
[151:27.34]I gotta hide.
[151:46.72]That wasn't worth it.
[151:48.08]Okay, the bell's ringing.
[151:49.18]The bell's ringing.
[151:50.10]You know what that means, right?
[151:51.18]Is there anything else I got that I didn't get over here?
[151:55.28]Quickly, while I have, like, the second note.
[151:56.92]Let's go.
[151:58.55]Okay.
[151:59.69]The losing streak has ended, and it's daytime.
[152:05.17]I got out.
[152:05.53]99%.
[152:09.43]Damn.
[152:09.79]Damn.
[152:16.51]One percent?
[152:18.89]What does that mean?
[152:20.93]I don't understand what that means, because usually aren't the little bags five percent?
[152:23.79]I don't know.
[152:27.34]I can almost go to the next place, though.
[152:31.98]See?
[152:32.26]One high successful up there.
[152:35.78]I don't know what happens in particular if you do do, like, five or ten in a row with the same character.
[152:42.37]I'm assuming maybe it's like you get achievements or something.
[152:44.33]I don't know.
[152:46.93]I probably will never see those achievements.
[152:48.89]If they exist, you know.
[152:57.53]We can go down, or we can go up.
[153:01.55]I'm gonna go down, we're gonna use a bomb.
[153:04.01]No, fuck, no I'm not.
[153:10.70]I actually really don't know what to do here.
[153:13.42]I gotta get to that room.
[153:15.74]I'm gonna have to go all the way around.
[153:18.72]Yeah, that's the safest play.
[153:21.60]That is the safest play, is to go all around like this.
[153:27.87]Drop a bomb right here.
[153:31.61]Turn off the cameras.
[153:33.33]And go hack.
[153:43.66]Okay.
[153:46.96]Let's do it.
[153:54.56]Cameras are off.
[153:57.43]See, now it's a better bet if I go around the other side.
[153:59.21]Yeah.
[154:03.03]It's that same thing, so I shouldn't do that.
[154:10.05]Slide down.
[154:14.98]Much better.
[154:18.08]Nope.
[154:18.44]I wanna fall down, I don't wanna just grab onto shit.
[154:23.39]And we're gonna put a bomb.
[154:25.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[154:26.28]We're not gonna... Yes, we are.
[154:29.76]Hopefully it blows up before... Hopefully... I might have just gotten myself really screwed right there.
[154:34.94]Hopefully it doesn't kill him.
[154:36.44]It fucking killed him.
[154:38.26]It killed him in the worst possible spot.
[154:40.08]In the absolute worst possible spot he died.
[154:45.91]I have another bomb.
[154:46.41]I have one more bomb.
[154:47.93]You know what?
[154:48.59]I can do it.
[154:49.15]I can do this.
[154:49.53]You know why?
[154:50.89]I can put a bomb up there where that dead robot is.
[154:53.86]Blow it up and I can walk by him.
[154:58.12]Just have to not die to this guy.
[155:04.14]Okay.
[155:05.48]Here we go.
[155:12.64]That'll do it.
[155:14.29]That'll do it.
[155:17.25]No way.
[155:21.32]Did that blow two sections?
[155:30.30]It's okay.
[155:33.57]It's alright.
[155:34.31]It's already 500.
[155:37.75]See you later.
[155:39.77]I'm okay with that.
[155:41.17]That was a weird layout anyways.
[155:47.69]How much money we got?
[155:48.93]26,000?
[155:49.81]Let's go, let's unlock the next area.
[155:51.37]Let's see what else is there.
[155:52.95]I'm curious.
[155:55.46]After I unlock the next area, I really need to get some of these upgrades.
[155:58.40]I really do, because seriously, like, I'm blacking.
[156:01.06]I'm falling behind.
[156:01.68]This one right here, like, that's so key.
[156:03.34]I need it so bad.
[156:10.40]Let's do it.
[156:11.38]Clank's level 2.
[156:16.55]I'm so far behind.
[156:18.59]You know, the good thing, though, is every time you get to a new area, they sort of level up how much money you take.
[156:26.26]But for the purposes of the stream, let's see what, like, the third, kind of, or second technical area in the game is.
[156:33.84]What does it say?
[156:34.96]Some enemies have microphones and will react to noise you make.
[156:37.58]Hold the left bumper to sneak.
[156:41.62]Now we got noise people now.
[156:43.74]And birds.
[156:44.50]We got, like, birds flying around, too.
[156:48.68]Wonderful.
[157:02.23]So what does that mean?
[157:02.85]Does that mean that if I make noise up here, will he hear me?
[157:09.85]Or is that if I make noise inside of his little thing?
[157:16.19]I don't know.
[157:17.45]I'm confused about it.
[157:20.25]Okay, he just immediately turned around.
[157:26.74]I'm not sure... this mechanic quite yet.
[157:35.54]Because I'm sneaking right now, and he's kind of looking at me.
[157:40.80]Whatever, we'll come back to it.
[157:46.96]I still have, you know what, I gotta make sure I have this ready to go.
[157:49.11]Because in a case where I might get seen, I can do it.
[157:54.29]Does that bird have a microphone?
[158:00.79]No, it's just the little robots with the brains.
[158:06.66]Shit.
[158:07.06]I mean, I gotta kill the bird, but the bird won't come over here.
[158:14.14]What kind of bird flies that low like that?
[158:17.49]seriously bird are you sixty eight hundred dollars just go go go I I I'm learning about the new enemies I'll take this 68 hundred dollars for sure holy crap oh that was only 27 that means there's like 20 something thousand dollars on these levels now
[158:47.89]FancyPeaches, goodnight, dude.
[158:50.65]Sun's coming up, yeah.
[158:52.61]The sun is out now, yeah.
[158:54.47]This is not good.
[158:59.57]Yeah, thanks for coming, guys.
[159:00.59]If you're leaving or if you're just getting there, hello.
[159:03.67]I'm probably not going to stream for that much longer.
[159:05.36]You know what?
[159:07.04]How about this?
[159:07.44]I'll do three more runs.
[159:09.36]Three more, no matter what happens, and then I'm going to end the stream.
[159:13.78]But it was a good little trial run.
[159:23.20]As long as he doesn't fly down here, I'll be okay.
[159:24.64]You know what?
[159:25.18]I'm just gonna blow him up.
[159:26.30]He'll blow up, right?
[159:27.44]I guess not.
[159:27.82]Not quite.
[159:31.16]Is it one hit to kill those things?
[159:32.54]It better be.
[159:34.00]Yeah, it is.
[159:37.99]See that guy up there?
[159:39.05]Flying around all over the place?
[159:40.39]That's not good.
[159:46.29]I hate these birds.
[159:46.99]You know, these birds are like the worst enemy in the game because they're so erratic and they fly in random directions.
[159:55.14]If I can just blow the things up, I'll just blow them up.
[159:57.36]Forget it.
[159:58.52]Holy fuck.
[160:00.16]Oh my god.
[160:04.22]I'm glad I saw that.
[160:05.04]Why won't you move?
[160:07.48]What is this?
[160:08.42]What is this brigade?
[160:09.28]It's like five dudes here.
[160:17.43]Man.
[160:18.61]He stands there for a long time.
[160:19.91]I gotta time that.
[160:20.73]This is gonna be very, very annoying.
[160:25.65]Or is it?
[160:27.05]You know what?
[160:28.77]What if I just drop a bomb here?
[160:32.21]I gotta go right... No.
[160:34.29]Nope.
[160:39.73]I want... Hopefully these guys you only have to hit one time.
[160:42.33]Yep.
[160:43.11]Nope.
[160:44.65]It's probably twice or three times.
[160:45.86]I need that upgrade.
[160:47.80]Bad upgrade.
[160:50.38]If there wasn't a second one, I could just do this.
[160:55.59]Where is the other one?
[160:56.25]Where did the second one go?
[160:57.89]Wasn't there two of those Charger guys?
[161:10.52]And this guy is just a random stray dude.
[161:15.20]The sun's gonna come up.
[161:16.74]I'm gonna run out of time here.
[161:20.28]One hit?
[161:20.86]Two hits?
[161:22.91]I don't know.
[161:23.23]I don't know.
[161:24.77]I think I hit that guy once.
[161:25.77]Well, that's one.
[161:29.23]I think you have to hit those guys twice.
[161:30.59]It looked like he was dead, but he wasn't.
[161:34.31]Another new enemy.
[161:34.97]I have no idea what the hell it is.
[161:35.98]It's the flaming lantern thing.
[161:45.12]One.
[161:46.16]Two.
[161:50.24]Three.
[161:50.97]Four.
[161:54.24]Four hits?
[161:54.86]God.
[161:55.28]Oh, fuck.
[161:58.73]Are they locking me in?
[162:06.85]They're locking me in.
[162:07.37]I'm locked in.
[162:08.81]I'm locked in.
[162:09.39]I actually am locked in right now.
[162:12.85]Okay, bye.
[162:13.31]That's new.
[162:15.25]7,000.
[162:15.27]30%.
[162:15.31]Here's number three.
[162:15.79]I gotta go to bed.
[162:25.45]Hopefully I can make this one a good one.
[162:29.15]These guys... If I... I'm gonna avoid them.
[162:31.35]Screw that.
[162:33.98]There's no reason to even do that room.
[162:39.26]These rooms are getting real rough though.
[162:41.66]Those guys are big dudes that hit you, kill you in one hit.
[162:43.98]A bird flying around.
[162:50.60]And those guys take two hits.
[162:53.96]Shit.
[163:04.40]I got to get at least like 15 grand here.
[163:07.64]How much was that bad upgrade?
[163:16.93]This is definitely the last one because I'm going to make it a good one.
[163:22.30]That's it for him.
[163:34.82]Let's get it.
[163:37.24]If I can get two of these, I'll be happy.
[163:39.28]Two of those will be good.
[163:40.24]A lot of... Oh, here.
[163:41.98]Oh, beautiful.
[163:42.58]Look at this.
[163:42.98]Look at that.
[163:43.38]There's like four bags up there.
[163:46.04]Three.
[163:47.28]Yeah, I gotta get up there.
[163:48.16]I gotta get this one.
[163:49.36]No fooling around here.
[163:50.32]I have to get this one.
[163:55.24]That'll put me over probably $16,000 or $17,000.
[163:56.67]These guys are so slow.
[164:04.84]They're not going to see my little steam pipe that's coming out of my back, are they?
[164:07.94]Nope, not.
[164:20.57]Nice and easy.
[164:21.31]I don't want to mess this up.
[164:24.41]If I could get overconfident right now and just start doing it, and then he'll just point the light at me and I'll lose.
[164:30.94]See?
[164:32.10]No, he still wouldn't have seen me, but still, you know, I don't want to take anything to chance right now.
[164:35.80]This is the final run.
[164:41.44]I chanced it, and I did it.
[164:42.44]I chanced it.
[164:42.80]I chanced it.
[164:48.40]15k.
[164:54.91]Is there anything else I can get that's, like, in a decent distance away?
[165:02.24]Is that sun coming up?
[165:04.90]Yeah, that sun's coming up.
[165:06.32]It's time to run with the 16,000.
[165:07.12]That's a good, that was a good one.
[165:10.50]I don't know if that was like, yeah, that was like 60,000.
[165:13.08]Yeah, that's okay.
[165:17.45]One more.
[165:18.91]One more.
[165:20.69]One, it's the last one.
[165:21.65]One more.
[165:21.93]It's kind of the same layout, too.
[165:30.13]What?
[165:32.20]What the hell happened?
[165:32.76]Ugh, he's so erratic!
[165:37.60]Stop being so erratic!
[165:40.31]You son of a... bitches.
[165:43.83]You son of a bitch!
[165:45.55]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[165:46.61]Right, right, right, okay.
[165:48.51]Wait, what?
[165:49.57]I can hack this?
[165:50.11]What is it?
[165:51.97]I don't even wanna- what am I hacking?
[165:56.15]What the hell did I hack?
[165:58.11]An old, like, rumba vacuum on the ground that doesn't do anything?
[166:05.33]So do I have to stay still?
[166:06.37]Does the microphone mean he can hear me now or he did hear me?
[166:10.99]How do I get him to stop freaking out about everything?
[166:14.68]Because right now I'm sneaking.
[166:15.64]I don't think it matters.
[166:19.58]That's too dangerous for the final run.
[166:25.06]Too dangerous for me.
[166:33.08]Security room.
[166:35.18]I wonder if the security room turns off those robots.
[166:38.15]It might.
[166:38.43]There we go.
[166:43.35]Okay, so yeah, the red means he has heard you and he knows where you are.
[166:48.16]I wonder how close... I guess you can't get that close.
[166:53.09]He's stuck down there, though.
[166:54.05]I don't think he can do much.
[167:04.53]Alright, this is the room I need to get to.
[167:07.11]I don't even care.
[167:07.55]If I trip the alarm, I don't care.
[167:08.69]I'm going to go through this way.
[167:12.76]I'm going to go to the left.
[167:14.68]Remember, left.
[167:21.84]Nope.
[167:23.71]See, I didn't want to complete it because he would have seen me.
[167:27.73]I can't close the door.
[167:28.35]The door has to stay open.
[167:35.98]See, you're not gonna turn around.
[167:39.40]What a dumb robot.
[167:47.57]He's gonna blow up from that.
[167:49.33]Potentially.
[167:51.29]That'd save me a lot of hassle if he did.
[167:55.74]The other guy died too.
[167:56.48]That's good.
[167:56.92]Good.
[167:57.30]Good.
[168:02.59]I'm not sure what I can do here.
[168:03.71]Maybe if I leave the screen for a minute and I sneak back, he won't be red?
[168:07.94]No, he's still red.
[168:12.24]I don't know how long it takes for him to stop doing that.
[168:19.06]See, I can hack him.
[168:22.43]Whatever.
[168:22.75]We're going to do this... Actually, hold on.
[168:25.45]I'm going to look down here.
[168:26.09]Is there anything down there?
[168:26.89]There is.
[168:31.71]Can I blow this up?
[168:33.59]Let's go ahead and try this, just in case.
[168:37.35]If this blows up the wall over there, then I'm gonna try to go up.
[168:40.85]You know, make like a loop from going down and around.
[168:46.54]Is there a spike there?
[168:47.22]No, okay.
[168:47.84]I should be able to do it then.
[168:56.81]If I hit the bells, I can leave.
[168:59.11]I can run, you know?
[169:06.43]I should be able to go bang, bang, and then take off.
[169:08.75]This thing, I gotta hit four times.
[169:21.48]Oh, you fuck.
[169:23.16]Whoa, what the hell was that?
[169:24.30]He just took a flame pulse.
[169:25.36]Did you see that?
[169:26.17]Okay.
[169:28.09]Three.
[169:31.03]Four.
[169:33.08]Big guy down there is three.
[169:35.20]The guy running real fast is two.
[169:37.62]And the dipshit holding the nerf gun is one.
[169:41.25]Okay.
[169:42.93]I need a good opportunity here, otherwise I'm gonna die.
[169:49.09]What is the good opportunity?
[169:50.03]Right there?
[169:50.69]Or right... here?
[169:58.62]No, I'm gonna say like right now.
[169:59.70]Like right... Right when the fast guy moves.
[170:10.16]Perfect.
[170:11.94]Little sloppy, but perfect.
[170:14.43]That's one hit.
[170:17.53]Shit, I'm running out of time.
[170:23.43]That guy's not... How's that guy not dead?
[170:25.11]What?
[170:26.81]That was two right in his back.
[170:32.23]I'm running out of time.
[170:32.87]I'm running out of time!
[170:39.06]Move!
[170:42.90]Here we go.
[170:46.23]You fuck!
[170:47.07]Okay, I can jump.
[170:47.59]I can jump.
[170:49.71]It don't matter.
[170:51.23]Those guys insta-kill you.
[170:52.27]They insta-kill you.
[170:52.95]If they touch you, they insta-kill you.
[170:57.01]I thought they were going to just see me or something.
[170:59.45]One more.
[170:59.79]Last one.
[171:00.27]This is seriously the last one.
[171:01.49]That one was... That one was messed up.
[171:04.48]There was no money I could get unless I triggered the alarm.
[171:06.16]Unless I turned up the... You know what?
[171:07.80]That was not a good one to go out on.
[171:09.28]We're going out on this one.
[171:19.59]Man, these levels suck.
[171:28.47]That guy's freaking out.
[171:31.63]What the fuck?
[171:32.19]I don't even care.
[171:33.03]Go.
[171:34.03]Do you think I care?
[171:34.67]Do you think I care right now?
[171:37.60]Where's the money?
[171:38.70]Where's the money machine?
[171:39.50]I'm just running around like aimlessly.
[171:51.90]Last one.
[171:55.09]You know, I had like a 16,000 run that I was supposed to go out on, and I made the mistake of saying one more.
[172:05.67]That was a mistake.
[172:08.91]But now that I'm stuck in the one more, you know, we gotta get one more good one.
[172:18.47]What does he keep doing?
[172:21.58]He's gonna... Yep, there it is.
[172:23.30]The flame wave.
[172:24.12]He does like a flame strike.
[172:45.43]Good.
[172:47.71]Man, this is these security camera things.
[172:49.87]Oh, crap.
[172:50.97]That room is unbearable.
[172:53.33]He's gonna flame wave and kill me.
[172:55.65]Get blown up by the mine.
[172:56.39]Come on.
[172:56.77]Have a mine do something for me.
[172:58.01]Come up here and get hit by it.
[172:59.24]That's such a terrible place to be.
[173:03.50]Because if he comes up here and he does that, it's like a five block AoE.
[173:06.92]Shit.
[173:12.73]Shit.
[173:19.64]Don't do it.
[173:24.65]Is he seriously stuck over here?
[173:29.75]Come on.
[173:32.27]Get up here.
[173:32.83]Look, he's slowly but surely coming up here.
[173:36.75]I swear.
[173:40.08]Come on.
[173:40.40]You're almost here.
[173:42.90]Oh, for the love of God.
[173:47.48]I'm alive.
[173:48.68]No, I'm not.
[173:55.01]What happened?
[173:58.61]Oh, people are leaving.
[174:00.33]Mute's leaving.
[174:01.57]Well, good night, Mute.
[174:04.39]Good night, everyone that's stayed up this whole time.
[174:06.83]I have to get another one that's like 10 grand.
[174:13.60]No, that was bad.
[174:14.50]That was, like, glitched.
[174:15.44]You see that thing got, like, stuck on the wall and I had to, like, go down there.
[174:19.09]That one didn't count.
[174:20.31]This one counts.
[174:22.69]Yeah, see, this one's gonna count because I'm gonna get this and leave.
[174:30.32]Okay, bring your noise machine over here.
[174:33.86]They're gonna give a crap.
[174:35.42]I'm gonna be dead.
[174:47.01]What happened?
[174:49.99]There's a new trap?
[174:51.43]The electricity comes out of the ground?
[174:57.91]You gotta be kidding me.
[175:01.65]So that was what was hackable before.
[175:04.18]So why did it not kill me before?
[175:10.86]I'm seeing new enemies, too, that I've never seen before.
[175:12.96]These guys have sniper rifles.
[175:24.23]Screw the room back there.
[175:26.81]I'm just dropping a bomb, and hopefully I... You know what's really messing me up is those flame guys that fly around.
[175:32.79]They take four hits.
[175:37.54]This is not gonna be... I have to go in this... See?
[175:40.12]What the hell are you doing up here?
[175:41.36]Get out of here!
[175:44.48]Man.
[175:46.52]You can follow me back to my spaceship?
[175:51.47]Is it when he blinks he's about to do it?
[175:56.04]He like blinks and I don't even know.
[175:59.45]Wait for me.
[176:01.61]Maybe he'll get stuck back here.
[176:14.12]So it's after you hit him.
[176:17.10]Not necessarily.
[176:19.44]Whatever.
[176:19.74]I'm gonna stick around to find out.
[176:34.93]I have to go this way because I can't drop down.
[176:37.63]This is going to be very hard because I have to time this when he turns around and the camera's there and I... Into the spikes.
[176:49.04]I couldn't have gone any better.
[176:53.40]How far, how close does this guy get?
[176:58.37]You know, is it... It's right here.
[177:01.99]I'm doing it.
[177:02.55]It's right here.
[177:04.59]Let me move my cranberry juice out of the way.
[177:06.31]This is important.
[177:15.62]Is he going to take more than one hit?
[177:24.24]I think I got him stuck.
[177:25.53]Yeah, he's glitched out.
[177:26.67]I should be able to get him.
[177:27.37]Yeah.
[177:35.45]Turn off.
[177:44.52]Shuts off all that stuff.
[177:51.56]Now this should be a lot easier than it was before.
[177:54.99]How is that guy alive on the spikes?
[177:57.53]How am I going to kill the guy standing over there?
[177:59.43]How am I going to do that?
[178:00.59]How am I going to do this?
[178:11.10]That's how.
[178:13.56]That's how I'm gonna do it.
[178:15.58]How close does he get?
[178:16.29]Not close at all.
[178:16.81]Good.
[178:21.93]3,500.
[178:27.95]No.
[178:28.53]No.
[178:28.87]Bye.
[178:29.11]We're leaving.
[178:29.71]No.
[178:30.09]Don't even think about it.
[178:31.71]That's it.
[178:33.65]We're gone.
[178:34.53]Don't even think about it.
[178:36.81]Don't even think about it.
[178:37.73]What was I thinking?
[178:38.27]Yeah, we think I'm gonna think about that?
[178:40.99]I need to upgrade my shit before I die.
[178:42.43]I need to get a better weapon.
[178:44.65]That is number one right now.
[178:46.69]It takes me way too long to kill things, and thankfully I can do it now.
[178:54.21]Yes, I'm absolutely doing that.
[178:59.83]Okay.
[179:01.73]That's it.
[179:03.01]We're done.
[179:04.29]I got one more.
[179:05.24]It's over.
[179:05.82]It's over.
[179:09.87]Uh, thanks though for coming out, everybody.
[179:13.04]If you, uh, if you're going to bed, you're going to bed.
[179:15.96]If you're still up, you're still up.
[179:18.41]I might, like for instance, because this is day 33 right now, and I am currently like right here.
[179:28.55]I've learned a lot.
[179:29.15]I mean, you saw these first two areas.
[179:31.43]I had no idea what the hell was going on.
[179:33.88]You know what I mean?
[179:34.90]Oh, Star says encore.
[179:35.96]Let's go.
[179:36.32]Go ahead.
[179:37.98]I saw encore in the chat from Star.
[179:39.22]Gonna have to do one more.
[179:42.80]You know, sometimes you just have to come back out on the stage.
[179:47.95]The audience was there.
[179:48.71]I had to just pull back the curtain.
[179:49.87]I said, we're not done with the show.
[179:52.93]The casting director and like the stage director is screaming at me right now like, Get off the stage!
[179:57.93]What the fuck are you doing?!
[180:00.21]I'm just like, sorry man, sometimes you gotta do it.
[180:03.70]Sometimes you gotta do one more.
[180:12.76]Sometimes you just gotta do one more.
[180:16.74]Sometimes you gotta do one more and this one was gonna be like fucking five thousand hundred dollars.
[180:34.07]Sometimes you gotta do one more.
[180:36.14]Sometimes you gotta do an encore.
[180:37.62]One more.
[180:44.10]You know, sometimes, like, you're on the stage and, like, all of a sudden you gotta do, like, one more.
[180:47.86]If I can open the door, actually, he'll die for that.
[180:56.03]See, these are the things on the ground that are giving me a real pain in the ass.
[180:58.57]I have to hack these.
[181:01.98]So now that's gone.
[181:03.40]Thank the Lord.
[181:05.32]Actually, you know what?
[181:06.63]Come on in, boys.
[181:08.09]Come on in.
[181:11.91]I'll take the free kill.
[181:12.77]There's a new enemy.
[181:13.53]Another new one I haven't seen yet.
[181:15.93]It's holding a bunch of, like, knives.
[181:20.39]Steam's coming.
[181:20.93]Is that, like, poison?
[181:21.73]If I touch that, am I gonna die?
[181:22.73]I feel like if I touch that, I die.
[181:24.72]Right?
[181:26.42]That, to me, is touch that and you die.
[181:30.28]So we're not gonna touch it.
[181:40.28]Is it possible to even do this?
[181:41.80]I think it might be.
[181:42.40]I just have to do it perfectly.
[181:43.40]Get rid of that.
[181:44.66]I'm going to wait until this passes by again.
[181:47.36]And once it goes by, we're going to do it and I'm out of here.
[181:53.90]See you later.
[181:55.54]See you later.
[181:56.04]Ah, this room is wicked easy.
[182:03.65]Just look at this room up here.
[182:04.59]This room is simple.
[182:07.31]If I could, like, not... If I could stick to a wall, that'd be...
[182:11.21]If I could seriously... Hold on.
[182:15.39]I can... Hack it.
[182:18.90]He's gonna kill him.
[182:24.02]I should've died from that.
[182:29.00]Well, actually, they're hitting this thing, and it's not killing them.
[182:31.56]Oh, it's not?
[182:33.92]I have to kill this guy when he comes over here.
[182:37.01]Perfect.
[182:37.95]That's the guy with the biggest line of sight.
[182:39.13]That guy died.
[182:41.98]Beautiful.
[182:44.04]This is going to be a good takeaway.
[182:45.06]This is going to be a really good takeaway.
[182:49.67]Be careful.
[182:53.15]Man, this thing is going to kill me.
[182:54.63]I'm just going to skip this thing.
[182:55.73]I can't afford to get hit by that.
[183:00.93]Is that going to kill me?
[183:03.86]I don't know.
[183:04.18]These guys are like the poison guys, right?
[183:12.70]Good takeaway.
[183:14.92]Okay, now that's a takeaway.
[183:16.66]See you later.
[183:22.38]Okay, I did it.
[183:23.44]Did my encore.
[183:24.14]I got, like, my $16,000.
[183:25.08]Perfect.
[183:30.39]I only got 51%, whatever.
[183:34.29]I'm tired.
[183:34.77]My brain is scrambled eggs.
[183:41.27]And... Alright, guys.
[183:46.71]Oh, man.
[183:53.27]The crowd is saying encore.
[183:54.71]I mean, sometimes when you get an encore, you get... No.
[183:57.00]No, I'm done.
[183:57.58]I'm fucking done.
[184:05.94]Alright, guys.
[184:08.96]You're not gonna pressure me to do another one.
[184:12.92]Thank you for coming to the... Boo!
[184:17.96]Boo!
[184:22.71]The game's fun.
[184:23.33]The game's good.
[184:24.35]It's 15 bucks if you like games like that.
[184:27.77]Takes a little getting used to and it's difficult.
[184:30.75]And you have to beat it within 90 attempts.
[184:34.27]And I did, like, 40 there, and I'd say, like, 27 of them were terrible attempts.
[184:39.77]But I learned a little bit.
[184:41.05]I got a little bit better.
[184:43.05]Still made dumb mistakes, but that's why the game's fun.
[184:46.23]The Swindle.
[184:47.25]The Steampunk Cybercrime Caper.
[184:49.65]Pick it up on Steam.
[184:54.34]Check it out on Steam.
[184:57.62]No, but for real, guys, thanks for coming.
[184:59.64]I don't know when the next one's gonna be.
[185:01.04]I have no idea.
[185:03.07]I'm going to stream whenever I feel like streaming.
[185:05.11]I don't know when.
[185:06.55]But it's going to happen a lot more frequently now.
[185:08.51]So just if you enjoy it, then you can come watch.
[185:13.35]Thanks for coming.
[185:14.67]And take it easy, guys.
[185:17.35]Thanks for coming.
[185:19.17]Much love.
[185:19.69]Thank you for the game mute.
[185:21.93]It's fun.
[185:23.63]Okay.
[185:24.91]Have a good evening.
[185:25.59]Actually, good evening.
[185:26.42]It's like 7 o'clock in the morning.
[185:28.88]Have a good morning.
[185:30.82]Or good afternoon.
[185:33.15]Goodbye.
