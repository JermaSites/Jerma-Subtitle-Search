[00:01.51]Hey.
[00:03.65]What's happening?
[00:05.49]How's everybody doing?
[00:10.58]Getting started a little later than I wanted to.
[00:13.06]I had to take care of something that was a little stressful, but was taken care of.
[00:21.06]Sorry, I'm about 20 minutes past where I usually would like to start.
[00:25.88]But we're good.
[00:29.52]We're good.
[00:29.88]We're good.
[00:30.16]We're good.
[00:31.34]We're going to play Man of Medan.
[00:34.32]Or is it Medan?
[00:36.94]Medan?
[00:38.88]Medan?
[00:39.30]I don't know how to pronounce it.
[00:43.34]With italics.
[00:44.02]It's going to be a co-op nightmare stream.
[00:48.72]It's going to be scary.
[00:53.40]This game apparently sucks.
[00:54.30]Just want to get that out of the way.
[01:02.37]But we're going to do it in co-op.
[01:04.75]And I heard that doing it in co-op makes the game exponentially more fun.
[01:11.58]This is a game on choices, on talking to people, on making decisions as a party of two, on who stays and who goes.
[01:26.27]We're going to need your help on deciding on who that should be.
[01:32.80]And at the end of the day, we're going to do whatever the funniest, laugh out loud, YouTuber storyline is.
[01:45.79]No, I'm just kidding.
[01:46.91]The game solo apparently is really, really bad.
[01:49.27]The game with a friend is apparently very fun.
[01:52.55]That's what I've heard.
[01:58.93]So, without further ado, we're going to see if Mr. Italics, you guys all know Italics, we're currently squad streaming right now.
[02:05.83]If you don't know who Italics is, where have you been?
[02:11.00]Huh?
[02:13.78]You don't know who that is?
[02:14.52]You can probably see their stream right now.
[02:24.93]Let me move this.
[02:26.01]Can you see this?
[02:29.10]I thought, this is funny because if you don't know, Italics and I currently live together.
[02:34.88]And I thought that because we're both on a VPN, that this was our like fake locations.
[02:46.41]I was like, wow, that's kind of funny.
[02:48.49]Chinese market, China South Sea.
[02:50.83]Wow, that's weird how it's routing us.
[02:54.35]He's like, no, dude, that's where the game starts.
[02:57.23]Because it's like multiplayer.
[02:59.18]I thought it was like, oh, this is where this person's from.
[03:00.82]I don't know.
[03:08.06]Chinese market.
[03:09.02]Like, how do they know?
[03:09.80]So I'm going to do a new story.
[03:13.57]What's going to start?
[03:14.63]I think we have to pick characters.
[03:15.71]Play this in co-op.
[03:17.51]No, no, I'm just going to... Talix is going to be in the call, and he's going to watch me play.
[03:22.17]What do you think we're doing?
[03:25.51]Why would they show your address?
[03:26.95]I don't know.
[03:28.01]I didn't know this took place in China.
[03:33.24]Yes, my name is Rowdy.
[03:34.32]My name's been Rowdy for over a year.
[03:36.52]Alright, let's see if we can get italics in here.
[03:42.04]Hello?
[03:43.38]Yes.
[03:44.50]I am present.
[03:44.92]Hey, there you are.
[03:46.00]Hey, everybody.
[03:48.42]Present, and currently accounted for.
[03:51.80]Yeah, did you push the start button?
[03:54.29]Oh, I thought, I didn't know you were ready.
[03:55.81]Are you ready?
[03:56.45]No, I mean like, uh, the start squad button.
[03:59.98]Oh, I didn't, I thought I did that.
[04:04.72]Whoa, so wait, now there's a squad.
[04:08.00]Yes, that's what happens when you push the start button.
[04:12.95]What?
[04:13.43]So now, of course, I got a custom link here for you.
[04:15.53]Twitch.tv.
[04:17.41]Slash squad.
[04:19.29]What?
[04:19.73]Oh, dude.
[04:20.97]What?
[04:23.76]Alright.
[04:24.74]Are you ready?
[04:26.32]I'm ready.
[04:26.90]Let's go.
[04:27.10]I want a- I want a Let's Go... Pikachu.
[04:30.78]Alright!
[04:33.74]There, he did it.
[04:36.11]Let's go Pikachu!
[04:37.19]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:38.63]This is important.
[04:39.21]What do you have on your screen?
[04:40.35]Do you have anything on your screen right now?
[04:42.97]Or is this- Do I get to choose this?
[04:45.39]You choose.
[04:46.07]Oh, fuck.
[04:47.31]Chat, who the hell am I gonna do?
[04:50.29]Um, personally, I would pick Bulbasaur.
[04:53.22]Well, there's not a third one.
[04:55.97]Joe or Charlie?
[04:57.27]Which one of those sounds more me to you?
[05:00.69]You're definitely a Charlie.
[05:02.33]Am I a Charlie?
[05:06.07]Why is everybody in chat saying I'm more of a Joe?
[05:11.66]Charlie Joe.
[05:12.80]Charlie's are like... Which one's more likely to have facial hair?
[05:16.54]That's definitely Joe.
[05:18.94]I mean, that's pretty true.
[05:24.54]Your name starts with J. You should be the one with the J. And there's an E in there, too.
[05:29.04]Okay.
[05:29.44]Oh, there's the same letter.
[05:30.82]Yeah, now they're writing the same letter.
[05:32.91]I picked Joe.
[05:33.49]Chat does know the alphabet.
[05:35.39]They also know how to count.
[05:36.81]I know the alphabet, too, though.
[05:37.89]So that's why I picked Joe.
[05:41.41]Alright, are you ready?
[05:42.77]I think you're ready, right?
[05:44.65]Uh, yeah, I'm ready.
[05:46.47]So, we don't know if there's a... Is there, like, a part where we split up and we have to mute each other in Discord?
[05:53.28]That is probably going to happen.
[05:55.26]We are on each other's team when it's beneficial to us, and we're trying to hamper each other, I guess, when it is also advantageous.
[06:04.75]Hmm.
[06:06.03]Interesting.
[06:06.59]Okay.
[06:09.61]Dude, I'm ready.
[06:14.51]I hope so, because this is what we're doing.
[06:15.79]There's not a plan B. You know what?
[06:19.81]I'm not ready, actually, if it's this.
[06:21.29]Let's do something else.
[06:23.52]Alright, which one of those is Joe?
[06:24.49]Are you Charlie then?
[06:25.25]That makes you Charlie.
[06:26.91]I guess I'm Charlie.
[06:33.03]Whichever person I end up being, I guarantee you that they're both douches.
[06:36.43]It's too loud?
[06:45.26]Well, every cutscene is loud.
[06:46.88]Does this take place in the 40s?
[06:50.12]I thought that this takes place in China.
[06:54.00]Not that they're like, oh, does this take place in the 40s?
[06:55.78]No, it takes place in China.
[06:56.88]That's a time period.
[06:58.36]Yeah, but that China didn't exist back then.
[07:01.98]They weren't even on the map.
[07:07.82]In fact, I think it was Matt Damon who put them on the map.
[07:11.05]That's the first time I learned of the Great Wall.
[07:12.93]I think this is us.
[07:13.57]You should read up on it sometime.
[07:15.47]All right, that's Joe.
[07:16.43]And which one of these is Joe?
[07:17.59]I think that's Joe.
[07:18.55]All righty, Buster.
[07:19.57]We better mosey on back to the ship.
[07:21.59]You're Buster.
[07:24.79]I think Buster's just a thing you call your friends.
[07:27.45]That's me?
[07:28.19]Charlie, this is me?
[07:29.41]No, that's... Who's Charlie?
[07:30.61]Which one?
[07:31.23]Charlie's on the left.
[07:32.77]And now he's on the right.
[07:36.37]Alright, this is you.
[07:37.55]No, no, I don't think any of these people are us.
[07:41.38]Yeah, they are.
[07:41.74]I have subtitles on.
[07:54.98]Is this you?
[07:55.26]Yeah, I'm watching you.
[07:57.50]Are you curious or are you dubious?
[08:07.77]That's you.
[08:08.51]This is me?
[08:09.61]Yeah, I'm punching stuff.
[08:11.21]Oh, what?
[08:12.63]I'm curious.
[08:14.19]What do you mean you're punching stuff?
[08:16.07]I'm over here just throwing... What?
[08:20.60]There's a training dummy and I'm fighting the training dummy.
[08:23.38]Oh, I thought you were like punching people.
[08:25.78]No.
[08:26.14]I thought you were like, I'm over here punching things.
[08:29.12]I'm just like, what?
[08:29.58]I'm getting my fortune told.
[08:32.36]Alright.
[08:34.35]I gotta turn subtitles off, but I don't have an option to... Hold on.
[08:37.56]There was a QTE in my game within the first 30 seconds of the game starting.
[08:41.50]Hold on, wait, wait.
[08:42.32]Accessibility?
[08:48.33]Where are my subtitles?
[08:53.03]Why are these not on?
[08:54.43]My subtitles are already on.
[08:56.03]Okay, mine are on.
[09:00.04]Okay, there we go.
[09:02.64]I'm ready.
[09:04.98]Okay, I think you have to ready up too.
[09:07.78]What?
[09:07.96]Yeah, because I paused the game.
[09:10.66]Oh, I see.
[09:11.42]So it's like in Smite.
[09:12.92]Yeah, I get two pauses the whole game.
[09:14.80]Alright, here we go.
[09:17.26]Hold on, my QTE's getting more challenging.
[09:22.82]I mean, this is a really advanced training dummy.
[09:28.13]What do I see?
[09:31.01]Uh...
[09:38.07]What do I see?
[09:39.03]What do you- Hey!
[09:39.83]I'm trying to look at stuff!
[09:40.65]I just got an achievement!
[09:41.63]I just beat that training dummy better than anybody ever has.
[09:46.45]You just fucked it all up!
[09:47.69]I was supposed to look at that and you, like, grabbed me!
[09:50.66]A quarter's like five dollars in 1940s money, by the way.
[09:55.98]Just thought you should know that.
[09:59.80]Wait, now it's my turn.
[10:05.02]No, I'm getting my fortune pulled.
[10:09.37]oh this is hopeful will joe return those two quarters wait what I'm my I'm asking the fortune teller whether you're gonna return the 50 cents I just loaned you oh it's the smash dummy I thought you said I can't all right I'm no more fucking around
[10:44.76]Wait, did you miss one?
[10:46.46]No.
[10:48.29]I did not.
[10:53.76]I missed one.
[10:57.43]Are you playing with mouse and keyboard?
[10:59.13]Can I die?
[11:00.45]What if I die here and Joe's dead?
[11:02.36]Have a nice day.
[11:03.34]Why am I playing with mouse and keyboard?
[11:04.50]I can play with controller, right?
[11:05.98]Yeah, you can play with the... That's what I'm doing.
[11:07.46]Hey, Chuck, we better get back to the ship.
[11:10.02]We don't want to get stranded.
[11:11.30]Come on, man.
[11:11.94]Just let me ask another question.
[11:12.99]We really need to get back.
[11:15.25]You interrupted my fortune, so I guess we're square.
[11:17.47]Did you see what was on the red tile?
[11:20.07]Yeah, but, like, I'm not the fortune teller, so I don't know what those things mean.
[11:24.77]What was on the red tile?
[11:30.23]Hold on.
[11:30.75]The first one was a flower.
[11:32.91]I can't hear anything.
[11:33.89]No, this is the loudest segment in any game.
[11:40.28]Accurately simulates what it's like to work on one of these cargo ships.
[11:43.52]This is so fucking loud.
[11:44.86]This is way too loud.
[11:56.69]Oh, did you pause?
[11:58.47]Guess what?
[11:59.03]If you alt-tab, the game pauses.
[12:01.85]Oh, you paused it.
[12:02.73]All right, well, you got your pause in.
[12:07.34]Is this a five-second countdown?
[12:09.64]Yeah, that's so no one has an advantage.
[12:11.92]All right, so what's in there?
[12:18.56]You get three guesses what's in there.
[12:21.08]Drugs?
[12:23.31]Poison.
[12:23.89]Yeah, drugs, poison.
[12:24.51]I can't hear anything he's saying.
[12:26.13]Who the fuck is that?
[12:50.88]Oh, I failed the QTE.
[12:51.84]Oh, no.
[12:53.40]So you get to be passed out.
[12:54.54]I'm going to jail.
[12:56.65]All right, so we're going to have separate stories here then.
[13:01.91]Oh, okay.
[13:02.29]Oh, shit.
[13:02.47]Did you alt-tab?
[13:03.13]I alt-tabbed.
[13:03.97]Hold on.
[13:04.53]Yeah, okay.
[13:06.77]Thank you.
[13:20.81]I wanted to make sure we were clear who did this.
[13:23.19]Alright, alright.
[13:24.25]Are you ready to mute each other to go to our separate ways, or should we just talk to each other?
[13:27.98]Uh, okay.
[13:29.84]Alright, I'm gonna mute.
[13:30.90]You ready?
[13:32.20]Separate ways.
[13:34.64]He can't, he's gone.
[13:41.66]Well, aren't you just gonna watch me because you're knocked out?
[13:43.81]Do you have any choices to make while you're unconscious?
[13:46.79]Somebody tell him yes, because I can't, I'll alt-tab him.
[13:54.78]Don't spoil it.
[13:55.44]Yeah, we're not going to spoil each other's game.
[13:56.90]We're going for it.
[14:01.26]Alright, so I'm in jail and he's... Alright, so show how we... God!
[14:09.75]There's poison.
[14:17.89]I knew it.
[14:19.51]I could turn this shit down, but I can't pause the game.
[14:24.28]All right, I'm gonna I need to I'm gonna lower the volume.
[14:31.74]So what was in there?
[14:34.34]Joe.
[14:51.48]Why would you increase the sedation?
[14:52.82]Why would you do that?
[14:53.64]Aren't they asking you questions?
[15:04.13]Okay, I need to lower the fucking volume here.
[15:08.05]Tal is Charlie.
[15:09.13]Yes, I know.
[15:17.71]Yes, can I help you?
[15:20.48]Tell him I'm lowering the volume.
[15:22.07]I know, I know, I know.
[15:23.81]It says I'm lowering the volume.
[15:25.67]Are you doing something important?
[15:30.43]Okay, he'll understand.
[15:31.09]He'll see that we're ready.
[15:31.69]Oh, now you're ready.
[15:32.49]Yes, he'll get it.
[15:33.51]Okay.
[15:34.27]Wait, wait, I can alt-tab.
[15:35.33]We're lowering the game volume.
[15:36.49]Sorry, I was lowering the game volume.
[15:38.43]Alt-tabbing would keep me paused, so I'll... Okay, I was lowering the game volume.
[15:41.49]I suggest you do the same thing.
[15:43.12]Okay.
[15:44.18]Because it's fucking loud as hell.
[15:49.27]Alright.
[15:49.79]You good?
[15:50.55]We're good.
[15:50.81]Yeah, we're back.
[15:51.31]Let's go.
[15:55.77]Alright, so now... I got a picture here.
[16:04.50]What if I take a wicked long fucking time?
[16:08.32]Use a bind?
[16:08.86]I know it's too late, though.
[16:10.34]To pop.
[16:10.78]Come back soon.
[16:14.88]Will he just eventually come find me?
[16:18.85]Okay.
[16:23.25]Is it first aid bin over here?
[16:25.17]First aid locker?
[16:30.21]That was scary.
[16:32.75]That was fucked up.
[16:37.25]Is that him?
[16:37.67]That's not italics, right?
[16:43.79]Alright, get the mouse off the screen before everybody freaks out.
[16:48.84]Nobody picks up a key like that.
[16:50.14]Alright, check the fingernails.
[16:53.37]Are they dirty?
[16:55.67]Alright.
[16:55.87]They're pretty clean.
[16:57.37]Actually, that one's dirty.
[17:03.09]Okay, I got a key.
[17:04.81]Should I... Should I, like, unmute and be like, Hey, I got a key!
[17:09.26]Do you need a key?
[17:12.24]He's got a pen.
[17:12.92]Should I move him?
[17:20.76]I need to move this guy.
[17:29.55]How do I move the dentist, or whatever this guy is?
[17:41.96]What the fuck was that?
[17:43.86]What's this camera angle?
[17:49.04]Alright, the graphics are actually pretty damn good.
[17:51.35]I like the graphics and I like the camera.
[18:03.04]It feels so... I feel like something bad's gonna happen any second.
[18:15.26]Is this me?
[18:16.14]Alright, I wonder, is it Alex in here?
[18:17.66]Found him!
[18:22.48]Um, hold on, just do this right now, if you haven't done it.
[18:28.52]And when I mean do this, I mean you have to help me do this.
[18:30.52]How do I make a keybind to mute myself?
[18:32.76]In Discord?
[18:34.07]Okay.
[18:35.19]Walk me through it.
[18:36.71]User settings.
[18:37.69]User settings.
[18:39.11]Got it.
[18:39.61]Keybinds under app settings is the fourth one down.
[18:41.73]App settings, keybinds, fourth one down.
[18:43.17]Got it.
[18:44.45]Add a keybind top right.
[18:45.81]Add a keybind.
[18:46.33]Blue button.
[18:46.69]Blue button.
[18:47.17]Got it.
[18:47.37]Okay.
[18:48.55]Drop down menu for action.
[18:49.83]Got it.
[18:51.09]Mute or deafen and then keybind click and then type the key that you want it to be bound to.
[18:56.39]Got it.
[19:01.29]Hello?
[19:02.63]Oh, I have to press it again.
[19:05.85]It's not push to talk.
[19:07.87]Toggle mute.
[19:08.83]It should be working.
[19:11.62]All right.
[19:12.50]So, did that work?
[19:14.10]Let's test it.
[19:15.10]Hello?
[19:15.68]Hello, we're good.
[19:16.40]All right, I'm ready.
[19:17.10]Uh-huh.
[19:17.84]You're good.
[19:18.42]Okay, you did it.
[19:19.42]That was a fast turnaround, honestly.
[19:20.94]I probably made Discord tech support look bad.
[19:23.32]Probably did.
[19:23.78]All right, here we go.
[19:26.34]Professional streamer?
[19:27.12]When did I ever say that?
[19:28.50]I'm just a fucking guy, man.
[19:37.57]Oh, right!
[19:40.41]I found a fucking body!
[19:42.69]Well, somebody just told you that.
[19:43.83]It's okay.
[19:45.09]Alright, so here we go.
[19:47.89]Are we controlling this?
[19:48.83]I believe we're controlling this.
[19:50.03]Come, you wanna come see the body?
[19:51.47]There's no punch bo- Okay, sorry.
[19:53.00]I didn't do that.
[19:53.52]I did- I did that.
[19:57.04]Look at the guy's face.
[19:59.60]It's like, God damn it, another pause!
[20:04.32]Honestly, I was pushing every button to see if I could punch you before you punch me.
[20:21.70]I love this.
[20:23.30]Can you get in like really close?
[20:26.54]I'm not already?
[20:27.84]Like get in closer to the camera.
[20:39.92]Waiting in an elevator.
[20:41.12]Alright, let's go.
[20:45.06]Uh-oh!
[20:45.38]QTEs!
[20:47.75]Press A to keep calm?
[20:48.83]Press A in time with the heartbeat.
[20:50.21]Oh, it's a rhythm game.
[20:51.57]Okay.
[20:54.91]Do we... Does that two?
[20:56.87]Or is that... It is.
[21:00.79]It's just two.
[21:02.44]I am manually beating my own heart.
[21:14.51]I knew you were gonna fail.
[21:16.05]How did I fail?
[21:16.73]I knew it.
[21:17.75]What?
[21:22.52]Look what you've done.
[21:25.38]That's the first LOL moment of the stream.
[21:27.30]But how did I fail that, though?
[21:31.42]Did I press A again?
[21:32.60]Maybe I just... I don't know.
[21:34.98]That was weird.
[21:38.22]LOL!
[21:39.56]That was a funny moment.
[21:40.48]That one's going in a YouTube video.
[21:44.25]Is that open?
[21:52.21]I feel like you and I just woke up from getting our wisdom teeth pulled.
[21:55.53]Who did that?
[21:57.09]I didn't do that.
[21:57.51]I didn't do that.
[21:58.15]Pause by italics.
[21:58.89]It's in the top left.
[21:59.53]That wasn't me.
[22:00.24]I'm the first one that said I didn't do that, though.
[22:03.30]What happens if you push right bumper on the controller?
[22:08.04]Me?
[22:08.54]Nothing.
[22:10.04]That's all I did.
[22:10.66]I pushed right bumper.
[22:12.59]Dude, alright.
[22:13.27]Well, we're currently walking around in post-dentist days.
[22:19.37]We both just had our wisdom teeth taken out.
[22:20.95]This is where you freed me.
[22:23.13]Um... I'm like... Hey, can you... Can you come back over here?
[22:29.97]You're stuck over there, aren't you?
[22:33.05]Do you have your own camera now?
[22:34.57]Yeah, do you?
[22:35.79]Yeah.
[22:36.31]Oh, okay.
[22:39.93]Where are you?
[22:42.88]There's a note and stuff in here.
[22:45.32]I read those already.
[22:46.32]They're meaningless.
[22:47.48]Are they meaningless?
[22:51.78]All right.
[22:51.98]Well, you can relay this info to me later.
[22:54.36]What about the safe?
[22:56.04]It's locked, as most safes do.
[23:03.99]I have no means to open it presently.
[23:05.85]There was also the body in my room.
[23:09.17]There was a box behind the body.
[23:11.89]Just making sure you know that.
[23:16.83]Where did you go?
[23:18.91]I'm looking at your childhood photos.
[23:23.16]Use the key.
[23:24.06]Key?
[23:24.30]What do you mean key?
[23:25.24]Key to a safe?
[23:26.12]It's a dial.
[23:26.70]What are you talking about?
[23:29.20]Is it a dial safe or is it a key lock safe?
[23:32.63]Uh-oh, we getting secret spoilers?
[23:35.15]What?
[23:36.61]The fuck are you guys talking about?
[23:40.64]I found the guy you killed.
[23:42.88]I didn't kill anybody.
[23:43.66]I mean, you went to the infirmary.
[23:50.38]This is the doctor.
[23:51.44]It's a dial.
[23:51.98]So, I'm just putting two and two together here.
[23:54.51]Everyone was screaming at me to put the key in the safe.
[23:56.63]Have you guys ever seen a safe before?
[24:03.34]Why would I put a key into the safe?
[24:05.02]Oh, you just scared the shit out of me.
[24:06.66]Okay, yeah, I thought that was me, but that was you.
[24:12.36]All right, we need to find... Whoever designed these things should probably go back to engineering school.
[24:17.67]I don't... What was down where you were?
[24:19.41]The body?
[24:20.47]Why does right bumper do that?
[24:22.75]Maybe right bumper is put on pause.
[24:25.49]Maybe you have that as, like, left click or something from, like, a bind key or something.
[24:35.54]Use the key on the door.
[24:36.38]I did.
[24:38.10]What door?
[24:43.10]I think I found something.
[24:44.96]Why would they give me full motion control of the face?
[24:54.49]Is that you making the noise?
[25:01.94]I don't know what I'm what the helling right now.
[25:03.74]I can't see what my character sees.
[25:06.06]I see you sneaking up on me though.
[25:09.86]You said what the hell?
[25:13.96]Yeah, what did you what the hell?
[25:17.03]Man, oh my god.
[25:18.95]Door?
[25:23.15]You guys are a couple of mouth breathers.
[25:25.03]This looks like poison gas on the ground.
[25:28.43]Look out for that kid!
[25:29.69]What was that?
[25:32.18]Did you see that?
[25:33.64]You didn't see that?
[25:35.94]Holy shit, how did you not see that?
[25:38.62]You go.
[25:39.10]I'll go first.
[25:39.92]No, you go first.
[25:41.52]I want you to be able to see the kid.
[25:44.03]Take a right.
[25:45.47]Yeah, but the kid went this way.
[25:46.45]That's true.
[25:46.77]That's true.
[25:47.33]They are only on screen for about a tenth of a second.
[25:48.91]What is that?
[26:01.88]Oh, never mind.
[26:02.46]We should have gone right.
[26:04.82]This is main story area.
[26:07.35]Press repeatedly on the door.
[26:12.55]Metallics failed.
[26:13.99]What do you mean you failed?
[26:16.89]I wanna see the kid now.
[26:19.11]What?
[26:20.42]He could be over here still.
[26:25.22]All you had to do is press A.
[26:28.45]Oh yeah, that's what all you had to do to hold your breath when the guy with the gun was walking down the hall.
[26:36.22]Funny coincidence.
[26:37.00]Let me try this one.
[26:38.80]Let me try to get it here.
[26:41.02]Hey Charlie, I'm gonna need your help over here, man.
[26:44.82]Alright, ready?
[26:52.47]Fuck no.
[26:53.59]Am I dead too?
[26:54.07]You said it.
[26:55.41]Fubar and that son.
[27:00.50]I think we were supposed to scream.
[27:04.41]No, that wasn't scary though.
[27:06.69]That could have been just somebody saying like, hey!
[27:09.61]I guess that would be kind of startling.
[27:12.25]Well, we have to examine that.
[27:15.35]No, everybody's dead on this ship now.
[27:18.03]Except us.
[27:19.33]Because... Aren't there like 35 playable characters in this game?
[27:27.57]That might be the free-to-play version.
[27:28.84]Another stiff?
[27:30.46]I think they're turning into a MOBA.
[27:32.69]Wait, something over here.
[27:33.83]Oh, I need to walk.
[27:37.91]Every character in this game has died, um... I'm going down these stairs like my grandfather.
[28:00.12]This is how my grandfather goes downstairs.
[28:08.34]All right, I'm down there.
[28:09.65]D-Face.
[28:14.01]Are you gonna come downstairs?
[28:15.31]I'm trying, but the camera reverses and it made me change the forward-backward.
[28:21.09]You gonna let me go downstairs?
[28:22.27]Because I just see both of our feet.
[28:25.68]All right, there's a room over here.
[28:28.38]Can we go in here?
[28:31.79]I physically can't see anything.
[28:33.91]This looks like a... No, is there a door right there?
[28:36.48]No.
[28:38.78]This floor is really dark.
[28:39.76]Old LB to walk faster.
[28:41.94]Is that true?
[28:44.36]It is very true.
[28:45.24]Oh.
[28:45.84]So, uh... Is it just me, or are you getting a real strange feeling right now?
[28:52.93]There's like everybody's dead.
[28:55.89]Tough guy.
[28:56.57]What do you mean strange feeling?
[28:59.54]Everyone you guys have come across are dead.
[29:01.98]Yeah, we found three bodies so far.
[29:05.80]Something's weird going on here.
[29:07.22]You getting a weird feeling about this?
[29:08.46]Like three people are dead.
[29:09.66]I know we're in the military and we see dead people all the time, but this is different.
[29:16.58]Hold three.
[29:25.20]I found a dentist in the cabinet.
[29:28.54]But... You get a weird feeling about something here?
[29:34.25]There's the kid!
[29:36.17]There's the kid!
[29:36.67]There's the kid!
[29:42.07]I don't know what kid you're talking about.
[29:43.42]Uh-oh.
[29:50.06]So you do... Oh, so I must be the telepathic one.
[29:55.87]He was over here.
[29:56.35]You guys, you get a weird feeling about this?
[30:01.03]What's happening here?
[30:01.59]Look, somebody just really likes mannequins.
[30:10.28]And posing them.
[30:14.00]Who's got the gun?
[30:15.08]I think I have the gun.
[30:16.04]You have the brass knuckles.
[30:20.86]Wait, what'd you get a knife?
[30:22.23]Oh.
[30:34.34]He's gonna backstab you.
[30:37.70]Oh shit Are we still together?
[30:48.96]I think so.
[31:03.92]What?
[31:04.20]What happened to you?
[31:04.96]What happened?
[31:07.98]What are you like... I'm not doing anything.
[31:12.60]They're saying mute.
[31:24.24]We have to mute.
[31:24.88]I think we're supposed to be muted.
[31:25.84]Alright, mute.
[31:30.19]Wait, what?
[31:30.67]I didn't want to do that.
[31:33.65]Holy shit!
[31:34.27]I didn't want to do that!
[31:39.68]Why did I do the pro- I thought it was like- I thought I was gonna go over there and like open the door!
[31:44.71]What?
[31:57.66]Hey, anything weird going on?
[31:58.90]Something weird going on for you?
[32:00.00]It's weird that I, yeah, something happened.
[32:02.34]A Tommy gun wielding man with a man foochoo just, uh, just shot me.
[32:09.99]Like a lot.
[32:10.81]What?
[32:12.21]Mayday!
[32:13.01]Mayday!
[32:14.59]Is anyone there?
[32:16.13]Hello?
[32:16.65]Can anyone out there hear me?
[32:21.16]Oh, come on!
[32:22.74]Hold on, I...
[32:27.65]so who do we what the hell is that monster oh why did I have to get the mud what was this small if only I had one that was even five percent bigger
[32:57.85]I'm gonna do like a scratch!
[33:18.16]Oh, the misty mountains cold.
[33:24.09]Is that the first chapter?
[33:25.41]I think that was the tutorial mission.
[33:28.83]I learned a lot about the nature of companionship and friendship and who should have a weapon
[33:39.94]taken point against the monster.
[33:44.62]Well, you see, what happened on my screen was you were a little kid.
[33:50.05]So you shot the kid.
[33:51.01]I shot at the little kid.
[33:52.83]Well, no, you weren't a little kid.
[33:54.01]I didn't know where you were, and the little kid ran away.
[33:56.77]And then I shot at a device that I didn't know I was shooting, by the way.
[34:02.92]I thought I was going to go over and open the door.
[34:04.88]But I ended up shooting into the thing that...
[34:10.32]that was me music I don't know but I I don't know you killed me though so that's one for you one point for you one point to gryffindor oh no this is supposed to be the anthology intro right yeah we're doing like a who can kill the other stream of the most
[34:35.72]he's gonna go like welcome to uh castedly tales of death and destruction and decay our next story we're gonna that's what's gonna happen I'm lost all right but what if the credits just rolled and we went back to main menu
[35:03.52]If the credits just rolled right now, that would be bad.
[35:12.45]Because that would mean that we spend that much money.
[35:17.23]That's true.
[35:17.65]It's going to open.
[35:22.88]Here it comes.
[35:24.30]A man and his wife spend an evening on their anniversary.
[35:28.16]There we go.
[35:29.24]Yep.
[35:29.44]A man of Madonna is filmed in front of a live studio audio.
[35:33.00]He's holding that close to his face.
[35:46.81]Says he can't see.
[35:50.59]It's BF Bugleberry.
[35:56.29]He's, uh... I am the curator.
[35:58.72]The curator of stories.
[36:00.82]Stories of love and hate, greed and beauty, life and death.
[36:07.76]Stories such as this one.
[36:11.50]I'm here to record the story you choose to tell.
[36:14.99]See, I got a lot of writer's block recently.
[36:16.61]You're gonna have to help me out to write the rest of my story.
[36:20.03]Am I getting paid for this?
[36:21.08]Unfinished stories.
[36:41.09]but you shouldn't fear death is after all inevitable.
[36:46.11]It is the tax one pays for having lived, and it comes eventually.
[36:50.47]Oh, taxes, taxes, what the fuck, taxes!
[36:53.82]None of us want for it to come too soon, do we?
[36:59.90]Sometimes you will be determining a story together, sometimes separately.
[37:04.38]What one does may not make complete sense to the other because we all have different perspectives.
[37:11.34]as in life the actions you take matter the choices you make don't say it will don't say it you already did I'll be keeping a close eye on your progress it's not my place to interfere but I might be persuaded to offer the occasional hint here's one for free
[37:29.74]There are pictures in this world that can show you some possible futures.
[37:34.13]It's just a really elaborate escape room.
[37:35.81]You can find them and study them.
[37:37.55]They may just help you to make better decisions.
[37:42.75]Or should I say decisions that result in outcomes you would prefer.
[37:46.79]This is a zoomer haircut.
[37:48.49]What?
[37:49.81]Why?
[37:50.67]We'll talk again soon enough.
[37:52.19]We'll have the opportunity to account for all the actions that you've taken.
[37:58.05]What a mess you've made.
[38:01.99]You know where Zoomer haircuts come from?
[38:04.07]I don't know.
[38:05.73]Justin Bieber?
[38:06.85]You ever seen Brad Pitt in Fury?
[38:11.23]No.
[38:13.91]They had, like, military cuts like that.
[38:16.48]That was... No, I thought that was Justin Bieber.
[38:18.50]Justin Bieber did that, right?
[38:20.04]No, Bieber had long hair.
[38:24.00]And then he had short hair.
[38:26.17]But the Bieber is like, I don't get my hair cut.
[38:30.63]Oh, so me.
[38:32.81]So I have the Bieber.
[38:37.66]Witty Brad.
[38:39.26]Okay, you're Brad.
[38:40.30]Brad's motivated.
[38:41.80]Wait, are you seeing this?
[38:42.94]Yeah, I'm seeing this.
[38:45.94]Got a couple of brews.
[38:50.34]Motivated Alex.
[38:51.88]Wait, Brad.
[38:53.42]Brad's brother, Julia's boyfriend.
[38:57.78]Are we both that stupid that we couldn't figure that out together?
[39:02.40]Hang on.
[39:03.62]Does the guy with glasses not have a significant other?
[39:10.68]No.
[39:12.35]You don't have 20-20 eyesight.
[39:13.71]You're not a Chad.
[39:15.25]Encouraging.
[39:15.85]Annoyed.
[39:16.23]I get to read your mind here.
[39:23.91]Say nothing.
[39:26.09]Nice.
[39:26.91]Dot, dot, dot.
[39:28.00]We get to be like the guardian angels watching over our two people that we're protecting here.
[39:33.14]Like you and I eating popcorn.
[39:34.38]Like, hey, are you his guardian angel?
[39:36.04]I'm his.
[39:37.20]What's he going to say?
[39:38.22]Oh, easy.
[39:39.00]Careful.
[39:40.12]That dive cam is like super expensive.
[39:42.96]Be cool.
[39:43.50]What?
[39:44.22]Julia and Conrad are, you know, how do I say it?
[39:47.58]Super fucking loaded.
[39:48.92]So?
[39:49.66]So don't sweat the little stuff, man.
[39:50.88]It's not cool.
[39:52.42]Don't make me regret letting you tag along.
[39:54.68]Why did you choose to say nothing?
[39:55.62]Because I didn't want to fucking start a problem.
[40:01.18]Uh, tag along?
[40:02.86]Seriously?
[40:03.32]I thought I was invited.
[40:13.53]Alright, amigo.
[40:14.67]Calvary's almost here.
[40:15.43]Sorry I'm a little snappy.
[40:17.61]I'm just...
[40:19.08]A new medical school would be stressful, you know?
[40:20.86]Total shocker.
[40:21.80]And man, the long distance thing, Julia, it's been rough.
[40:31.47]It's been like two weeks.
[40:35.01]Okay.
[40:36.65]Yep.
[40:37.51]Right on cue.
[40:38.31]What?
[40:39.27]Conrad doesn't think we have enough... What if we both just do silence each time?
[40:44.85]We don't communicate the entire time.
[40:46.63]Relationship updated.
[40:51.65]What's in there?
[40:52.23]Oh, it's got a seed box.
[40:53.63]What's in there?
[40:54.89]What's in the seed box?
[40:55.79]That was weird.
[40:56.32]It was a device or something.
[40:58.04]Is there something under the carpet?
[41:00.24]Yeah.
[41:20.51]Go with your gut.
[41:22.09]If it's right, you'll know.
[41:25.11]We're giving each other advice.
[41:27.49]Yeah, that's changing our direction wheels.
[41:31.03]Julia, reckless.
[41:32.33]Conrad's sister.
[41:34.32]Conrad, Julia's brother.
[41:35.64]Relaxed.
[41:36.46]Foolhardy.
[41:38.58]I think I recognize that guy.
[41:44.30]Sorry.
[41:45.48]Connie, this is Alex.
[41:47.33]Hey, what's up, man?
[41:48.31]Conrad.
[41:48.75]Hmm.
[41:51.87]I recognize him too.
[41:53.71]Yeah, that's somebody.
[41:55.54]Who's that?
[41:56.74]Is that the dude that plays Iceman in X-Men?
[41:59.68]Yeah.
[41:59.98]Yeah.
[42:14.12]Wait, why are you deciding with me?
[42:17.04]What did you decide?
[42:17.76]I imagine you two over there doing the same thing.
[42:19.45]What?
[42:19.55]No.
[42:19.65]What?
[42:46.97]Oh, here come the other characters.
[42:53.19]Why did he puke?
[42:54.09]Why did he do... Why did he do, like, the puke thing?
[42:58.15]Impatient.
[42:58.87]Captain of the Duke of Milan.
[43:00.27]Courageous.
[43:00.73]Okay.
[43:00.83]Awkward.
[43:01.01]How come I didn't get a beer?
[43:17.74]Because he asked me, Conrad asked me if I wanted one.
[43:20.60]Because we're cool now.
[43:22.18]What do you got?
[43:28.38]What the hell is going on?
[43:29.86]I don't know.
[43:31.50]You wouldn't say, hey guys, like sit down.
[43:32.82]You're going to hurt somebody.
[43:35.27]That's a lawsuit incoming.
[43:41.55]Alright, who's dead first?
[43:43.30]You wanna just pick one?
[43:44.12]And just, like, that's it?
[43:45.26]Like, okay, let's just pick who... Who cares if we like them or not?
[43:49.44]Like, we're gonna try to... I was saying, let's guess who's gonna die first, but you wanna, like, pick someone to kill.
[43:54.20]I thought that... You, uh, wanna go lie down?
[43:58.14]Yeah.
[43:59.49]You know, maybe I should.
[44:00.27]Could I vote for myself?
[44:05.37]Uh, I vote for the guy that fell down.
[44:11.50]Alright.
[44:12.12]Mute.
[44:12.34]What are they looking for?
[44:13.32]A nice dive.
[44:13.86]Um...
[44:36.63]Look at this.
[44:37.53]Brad did his homework.
[44:38.75]Who was that?
[44:39.21]Was that Italian?
[44:40.17]Come here.
[44:41.25]Look, you're the client.
[44:41.97]I think we got something.
[44:42.59]I'm just saying we don't have unlimited daylight.
[44:45.59]I'm going to go help Conrad and Julia with the camera.
[44:50.94]What you got?
[44:57.06]What do you got?
[44:58.65]Feast your eyes on this.
[45:00.29]We found a plane.
[45:01.57]A plane?
[45:02.73]Brad's calculations were right on the money.
[45:04.75]Always bet on Brad.
[45:05.97]Kid's a whiz.
[45:06.99]We should thank him.
[45:07.69]All right.
[45:09.18]You got to keep that person around.
[45:10.12]They waited until they came out here to find... Well, then you don't get any money.
[45:13.24]Hmm.
[45:26.72]you want money or not bro we could be rich wait are you saying we shouldn't die can't die the um fine you don't want to dive okay let's not dive guys look I think we got to listen to our experienced
[45:48.55]No, I wanted to die.
[45:50.52]Oh, I see.
[45:51.20]I'm sucking up right now.
[45:52.28]I see.
[45:52.58]What the hell?
[45:53.40]Wait, what?
[45:53.60]I feel like I'm watching... We're diving.
[45:54.74]But if anything goes wrong...
[46:20.03]First to die.
[46:20.29]God, I just can't wait to be the first one to go down there and guaranteed to die first.
[46:24.21]He looks right over into the lens like in this camera is like, hey guys.
[46:49.49]Oh, are we back?
[46:51.13]I believe we're back.
[46:53.13]Oh, okay.
[46:53.53]Did you see that?
[46:58.19]Did I see what?
[47:20.34]What is that?
[47:21.74]I don't see anything.
[47:24.75]I don't know if that's like a bug or if it's supposed to disappear when I look directly at it.
[47:34.01]Why I... What are you laughing about?
[47:43.06]This is just so fucking ridiculous.
[47:45.94]Alright, are you ready?
[47:51.66]And then we'll go through the final steps together.
[47:53.56]Cool.
[47:54.36]Just holler at us when you're ready.
[47:56.02]Don't pick up the binoculars.
[47:57.16]It's a waste of time.
[47:58.23]She's in the frame.
[47:59.81]Don't pick up binoculars?
[48:02.11]It's a waste.
[48:02.67]Maybe you'll see something I don't.
[48:04.09]I don't know.
[48:04.69]Wait, didn't you say, what the heck was that?
[48:07.43]Yeah, because it was like a game glitch.
[48:10.39]Game glitch, or did you see something?
[48:14.12]That kind of question will get somebody killed.
[48:25.56]This is out of focus.
[48:26.52]Oh.
[48:45.31]What was that?
[48:49.27]Did you see the thing?
[48:52.15]No, I'm looking for the sun.
[48:55.09]to look directly at it.
[48:56.67]It's not here.
[48:57.13]I didn't see anything.
[49:00.73]One, why are you acting so weird?
[49:02.65]And two, why are you offering to help for, like, the first time ever in your life?
[49:05.97]I was just thinking you might make a good first impression on the lovely Fliss.
[49:10.10]Okay.
[49:10.90]Now, three, don't call her the.
[49:13.36]She's a person, not a thing.
[49:14.78]And four, do you ever even think about anything else?
[49:17.44]Hey, lady's got a thirst, and I'm here to quench it.
[49:20.79]And what's with all the numbers?
[49:23.11]Trying to, like, get into your conversation.
[49:29.13]I saw that.
[49:30.86]Ooh, it's... No, I can't pause on my side.
[49:36.50]What happened?
[49:37.30]I will never push this button.
[49:38.52]The next time I push this button, I will uninstall the game.
[49:41.87]It's RB.
[49:43.97]RB?
[49:44.65]RBs?
[49:46.21]That sounds good to me.
[49:47.05]I've never eaten Arby's before.
[49:48.81]Is Arby's good?
[49:49.41]Have you ever had it?
[49:49.95]29 degrees.
[49:50.25]They do in Celsius this day in America.
[49:51.43]Is this?
[49:51.73]No, this is China.
[49:52.13]No, it's not.
[49:52.51]Are we still in China?
[49:53.21]Are we still supposed to be in China?
[49:54.75]Yeah.
[50:11.70]I'm just like... I'm just like turning... What?
[50:14.39]I just got like a QTE when you came over and said slam dunk.
[50:19.99]Slam dunk!
[50:35.90]Now look left and right.
[50:36.56]Hold on.
[50:36.76]I'm stuck in here.
[50:37.32]One of my options to speak is I like it when you're...
[50:53.85]I didn't catch that.
[50:54.59]Hey, I like it when you're strict.
[50:56.35]Sometimes I just want to be kept in line, you know what I'm saying?
[50:58.97]I don't mind a little submission now and then.
[51:00.73]Is there no way for you to turn that off?
[51:02.75]Turn what off?
[51:03.57]That thing where you have to hit on me like every two seconds.
[51:06.80]Somebody wrote this.
[51:09.42]I'm just standing next to you.
[51:10.34]Can't I be like, hey, dude, you're a fucking annoying person.
[51:13.04]So, is it working?
[51:14.04]Do you have brain damage?
[51:15.70]In my upstairs brain or my downstairs brain?
[51:17.86]Oh, fuck.
[51:19.95]I have to tell you, I'm getting a little concerned about the cavalier nature of this dive.
[51:24.91]These rules are all pretty basic stuff.
[51:27.88]How much experience do you have with these kind of dives?
[51:33.22]If this is your first unreported wreck, then you should know there's a very specific protocol you have to follow.
[51:49.94]Probably call.
[51:50.54]How is it immoral?
[51:51.32]I love just the wheels turning in your head.
[51:54.36]No.
[51:54.56]No.
[52:19.30]Hey, come play with this thing.
[52:20.08]It's cool.
[52:21.04]He's very confident for someone who's never spoken to a woman before.
[52:25.08]Wait, something down there?
[52:26.24]No, there was a computer.
[52:27.68]Wait, didn't the guy say?
[52:29.62]Look at the pictures.
[52:31.48]What am I looking at here?
[52:36.88]This is a fake license.
[52:45.00]I don't know what that was.
[52:47.31]They misspelled hype.
[52:50.95]Height is misspelled?
[52:52.47]Yeah, H-I-G-H-T.
[52:57.41]Really?
[52:58.11]I didn't pick up on that.
[52:58.97]What's up?
[53:00.43]How you doing?
[53:02.14]Sorry, that Brewski got the better of me.
[53:05.34]Was there something important on that license that I'm supposed to know?
[53:09.00]Jeez, man.
[53:09.94]You should know how to handle your liquor.
[53:11.58]Lay off.
[53:12.30]I was trying to... Just try to bond with Conrad like you said.
[53:14.79]Like guzzling brews?
[53:16.31]Come on.
[53:16.79]Okay, okay.
[53:18.21]You go hit the high seas.
[53:20.29]I'll be up when I'm good.
[53:22.41]Uh-oh.
[53:22.67]Dudes!
[53:23.41]Tanks are ready when you are.
[53:26.37]All right.
[53:27.61]Tanks are ready.
[53:28.19]All right.
[53:35.38]Tanks are ready.
[53:37.56]You ready to go for a dive?
[53:43.54]Hold on.
[53:44.06]Listen.
[53:44.36]Hold on.
[53:46.52]Hey.
[53:47.66]Hello.
[53:48.82]Hey.
[53:50.77]Hey.
[53:54.97]That was strange.
[53:56.33]I gotta get my steps in.
[54:00.37]How you feeling?
[54:02.43]Shouldn't have had that beer.
[54:04.40]Shouldn't have had that beer.
[54:08.38]Can I talk to you again?
[54:10.26]You know your brother can't handle his drink.
[54:12.08]Ah, shut up.
[54:12.82]Just a little seasick.
[54:13.76]My brother's fine.
[54:15.70]I'll be up as soon as I...
[54:18.86]Conrad, give me your hand.
[54:20.96]Okay.
[54:21.48]Wait, did I just... Yeah.
[54:22.50]This is the rebreather.
[54:23.52]I think I just got yoinked.
[54:24.88]Did I just yoink you?
[54:26.66]It takes all that CO2 that you'd normally just exhale into the water, and instead, it gets totally reused.
[54:32.44]Then it reduces decompression time on your way up.
[54:35.22]State of the art.
[54:37.86]Okay.
[54:39.28]O2 check done.
[54:40.32]Is that a... No, that's a streamer backpacker.
[54:46.07]I mean, TwitchCon is in just 20 days.
[54:48.67]I actually did see that.
[54:52.71]You're welcome.
[54:53.33]Am I going down?
[55:10.54]I'm gonna go see what Fliss is up to.
[55:12.16]Yeah.
[55:13.00]When you dive, I'm gonna take control of the boat and just leave.
[55:15.64]Hmm.
[55:23.05]Nope.
[55:23.71]Definitely.
[55:24.93]Definitely have to take that.
[55:26.81]Let's get a before photo.
[55:32.06]Selfie stick.
[55:39.50]Because of the implications.
[55:40.70]I thought I was holding a shield.
[55:42.90]I thought I was holding a shield.
[55:43.70]What the fuck was that?
[55:44.18]Alright, here we go.
[55:46.04]You ready?
[55:46.52]I think it's time to mute.
[55:48.17]Yeah, hey.
[55:51.03]Good luck.
[56:09.41]See you later.
[56:11.49]Or not.
[56:18.07]Don't you fall backwards in a dive?
[56:19.91]You go backwards in.
[56:27.93]Why mute?
[56:28.49]Because, uh, Metallix is getting a completely separate story connected to the one I'm doing, too.
[56:34.11]Uh, I think I'm seeing the same thing you're seeing.
[56:36.73]Oh.
[56:38.27]Well, eventually.
[56:42.36]Yeah, eventually.
[56:43.86]In about 25 seconds.
[56:49.40]Unless, um, I become the other character.
[56:52.82]You might.
[56:54.54]Howdy, Captain.
[56:56.24]You fancy a pint with your second-in-command?
[56:58.32]You are not my second-in-command.
[57:00.62]Third-in-command.
[57:01.50]No.
[57:01.84]Fresh and eager cabin boy.
[57:03.00]Still a no.
[57:03.62]So are you that... I'm the shark.
[57:05.34]...handsome seafaring client... I'm controlling her right now.
[57:08.50]...over a frosty amber liquid.
[57:15.47]All right.
[57:16.51]Mute.
[57:16.67]Shut up.
[57:16.83]Leave me alone.
[57:17.58]At this point, we just go sit over there.
[57:46.92]Rowdy is Fliss.
[57:50.62]I just Freaky Friday'd you out of your own body, and now I'm Alec.
[57:57.52]It's all good.
[58:01.27]Alright, so here we go.
[58:02.95]I'm controlling.
[58:05.47]Was that you or me?
[58:07.13]I'm on the boat.
[58:09.21]Wow, that is not your everyday wreck.
[58:10.51]I hope those clowns don't get me in trouble.
[58:39.20]Tal found a picture.
[58:40.64]I hope he's okay down there.
[58:51.24]Wait, binoculars, nice.
[59:26.35]Munkah S. Munkah S. Hold on.
[59:30.61]I... I missed it?
[59:38.00]What do you mean blind?
[59:40.00]These things are all fucking scratched up and like scuffed up.
[59:50.91]What are you guys talking about?
[59:52.39]Oh!
[59:55.57]Oh my god, it's a fucking buoy.
[60:05.52]Alright, let's talk.
[60:08.16]Can I talk to you?
[60:09.72]Let me get one of those beers.
[60:11.32]I want a beer.
[60:11.90]Uh, it is... I got to do some boat maintenance.
[60:26.40]Like, let's go.
[60:26.90]I'm serious.
[60:28.38]You can't fuck around with this stuff, Conrad.
[60:30.95]Do it for real, or don't do it.
[60:32.49]Yeah, totally.
[60:33.79]I gotcha.
[60:35.49]Serious.
[60:40.19]Enjoy your vacation.
[60:41.23]Yeah, sure, enjoy your vacation.
[60:42.55]Watch me.
[60:46.92]Alright, I gotta go clean, like, the bathroom or something.
[60:49.38]I have to go boat maintenance?
[60:50.46]I gotta go, like, re-oil the engine?
[60:53.38]Clean the sofa?
[60:54.00]Huh?
[60:56.21]Go fishing?
[60:59.09]Change the oil?
[61:01.27]What do I have to do with maintenance?
[61:06.59]What is this?
[61:20.78]Okay, that was a gun.
[61:21.54]There was a gun.
[61:29.08]He's finding all these secrets.
[61:30.86]That's not fair.
[61:31.52]Am I going to read a book?
[61:42.05]Should I hold on to this?
[61:47.92]Alright, grab the book.
[61:52.18]Shroud of Innocence.
[61:59.16]God damn it.
[62:00.07]That one wasn't me.
[62:01.83]You did that.
[62:02.29]I know.
[62:02.65]I pressed right bumper because somebody in... I thought, mm-hmm, yep.
[62:06.55]What?
[62:06.91]That's all I needed to hear.
[62:07.89]What do you mean that's all you needed to hear?
[62:09.85]I just wanted to make sure I'm not the crazy one.
[62:11.57]That right bumper actually pauses the game for no discernible reason.
[62:14.56]One person said hit right bumper, and I was like, why?
[62:16.60]Okay, and I just did it, so I'm an idiot.
[62:17.98]All right, see you.
[62:33.59]What's in the bag?
[62:36.07]No, I can't go in the backpack.
[62:37.11]Alright, so what do I need to do?
[62:38.15]Boat maintenance.
[62:38.81]I don't even know what that means.
[62:43.80]What's in there?
[62:46.68]No, don't go... What do I do here?
[62:53.67]Can I, like, change their oxygen levels?
[62:55.01]The weather looks clear.
[63:01.09]Oh, that's... What is that?
[63:03.98]Clouds?
[63:08.04]What?
[63:09.20]There's another boat coming up.
[63:12.13]On our... Wait a minute.
[63:13.59]Give me the binoculars.
[63:27.21]uh okay they're just here now we have unexpected guests okay uh don't don't talk about the divers just relax do not mention we have people in the water what do you think they want maybe they're fishermen I mean maybe that's their buoy hmm okay uh be on guard be ready for this I don't know just be on guard
[63:57.11]Mm-hmm.
[64:03.68]Hmm.
[64:03.86]That's not the Coast Guard.
[64:09.63]Uh-oh.
[64:09.75]What's happening?
[64:10.31]Uh...
[64:23.64]I think I'm going into phase two?
[64:26.70]Uh-oh.
[64:32.12]Hey, get out of here!
[64:34.13]Get out of here!
[64:35.41]Oh, shit!
[64:44.14]I hope I just didn't, like, kill italics.
[64:49.07]We can take care of this, man.
[64:50.29]It's not a problem.
[64:51.77]What do you think?
[64:52.33]Like, uh, 10 bucks cover it?
[64:56.61]Why did you just... Money?
[64:57.75]Why are you flashing your money?
[65:00.39]Well, shoot, you think it's more like 30?
[65:02.10]I can do 30.
[65:04.76]Alright, you guys drive a hard bargain, but I'm with you.
[65:07.20]Here, let's just throw in the whole pot.
[65:15.11]Let's go.
[65:17.33]No!
[65:21.32]What?
[65:22.62]They didn't even give them money.
[65:27.78]You are an idiot.
[65:29.26]What?
[65:30.40]They left, didn't they?
[65:31.56]That doesn't make you any less of an idiot.
[65:33.62]You had a funny way of saying, thank you, Conrad.
[65:36.78]You're a piece of work, Conrad.
[65:38.64]I'm not all work.
[65:39.44]I'm a little play, too.
[65:41.12]Are you trying to flirt with me?
[65:43.24]Is it working?
[65:44.05]Oh, he sucks.
[65:44.29]They're gonna come back.
[65:44.83]We gotta get out of here.
[66:03.87]Okay, I think they're on their way back up.
[66:05.63]And I was getting used to it just being you and me.
[66:07.45]We need to light the grill.
[66:08.35]Oh, oh, pick me.
[66:09.09]Pick me.
[66:09.39]You can call me Grill Capitan.
[66:11.79]You may light the grill, but I will never call you that.
[66:15.97]Time for food.
[66:20.51]Watch this be how he does.
[66:21.43]I didn't have to do anything.
[66:23.08]He just, like, puts... Oh, fuck!
[66:27.76]Okay.
[66:35.04]Are you serious?
[66:40.56]I thought about it.
[66:41.38]I thought about it.
[66:43.32]I thought about it.
[66:44.10]Yeah, I'm on the boat too.
[66:45.07]Yep, that's true.
[66:45.69]I thought about it.
[67:01.58]It was so close.
[67:03.40]I was a millimeter away from letting the boat just burn.
[67:11.90]Hey, welcome back.
[67:14.59]You almost killed me again.
[67:16.25]But this time I was smart.
[67:17.41]There was a little, uh, mishap.
[67:20.19]Little issue with the barbecue.
[67:22.01]Jesus, looked like the whole boat was lit up.
[67:24.45]I thought the video games were to escape reality.
[67:26.79]Anyway, um...
[67:30.41]What was up with that other boat?
[67:31.61]These fishing guys came by and ran into the dive line.
[67:34.09]Yeah, these idiots.
[67:34.83]Whatever.
[67:35.77]Who cares, right?
[67:36.61]They were just like, who cares?
[67:38.17]What'd you guys find?
[67:39.07]Well, we found the plane.
[67:41.11]And it is huge.
[67:42.79]Full of cool stuff.
[67:44.01]Unfortunately, we did not leave it as pristine as we could have.
[67:47.45]What?
[67:49.07]Why?
[67:49.37]The dive line, actually.
[67:52.47]How bad?
[67:53.09]Did you get ripped up?
[67:55.41]Did I get ripped up?
[67:56.25]Did I mess you up?
[67:57.02]That's just fucking perfect.
[67:59.55]Um, no, but I did pull the, like, flight stick of the plane, and it broke the plane in two.
[68:06.52]Oh, interesting so far.
[68:09.86]Let's see.
[68:10.38]Frankly, I hate it.
[68:19.66]You're getting to know these intrepid adventurers, then.
[68:22.87]Alex and his little brother Brad, trying to swim with the big fish.
[68:27.61]Both seem out of their depth.
[68:30.95]And Julia, the love of Alex's life.
[68:34.91]If only she felt the same.
[68:38.58]What about Conrad?
[68:40.00]A bold fellow, you might say.
[68:42.60]Or maybe you'd say arrogant.
[68:45.78]And then there's Captain Fliss.
[68:48.10]Strong, forthright, stubborn.
[68:52.54]She appears somewhat immune to Conrad's charms.
[68:57.00]So far, at least.
[68:59.96]Let me reassure you.
[69:01.64]You help them to make some decisions they'll value later on.
[69:06.99]You're doing well.
[69:10.39]Thanks.
[69:10.93]We can't let you lose yet.
[69:13.04]There's still three hours of gameplay.
[69:15.62]You're doing very well.
[69:17.34]You didn't let the boat burn from the barbecue.
[69:22.11]Good job.
[69:23.37]You have the intelligence of at least a nine year old.
[69:25.89]How well preserved was the plane?
[69:27.54]Brad, it was insane.
[69:28.82]It was like traveling through time.
[69:31.14]No shit.
[69:32.14]Well, it was like traveling through time and accidentally ending up in a dimension where the past is underwater and everything is covered in barnacles.
[69:39.06]And sharks.
[69:40.14]Sharks?
[69:40.94]Yeah, well, just one shark.
[69:43.37]Ah.
[69:43.53]Ah.
[69:45.95]Wasn't Comrade gonna get us some more beers after he helped Fliss?
[69:49.81]Maybe he decided, hey, I'll drink some, and then he got drunk.
[69:53.10]And since he was drunk, he forgot to bring it to us.
[69:55.68]And he just kept on drinking, and he drank all of it.
[69:57.70]I think there were four beers in that case.
[70:00.57]Yeah, I've been studying it for years.
[70:02.01]Yeah, when are you going to run to the grocery store and get us some stuff?
[70:06.92]I left it below deck if you want to check it out.
[70:11.12]Okay, now I'm... Oh, wait, what's that?
[70:14.85]So, what are you seeing?
[70:17.45]I'm about to grab the camera.
[70:19.37]Oh.
[70:19.97]I want to see the cool pictures you took.
[70:27.24]Nice.
[70:29.60]Okay.
[70:30.50]Pretty cool looking.
[70:32.12]You took these?
[70:39.29]Alright, what else?
[70:41.23]Can I put the camera down?
[70:42.19]Ooh, that's a good one.
[70:44.71]Uh, that's scary.
[70:45.45]I don't... Did you... Alright, I'll put this down.
[71:09.86]They only dive 30 meters?
[71:11.36]Okay.
[71:12.32]Yeah.
[71:13.40]Okay.
[71:15.68]Binoculars.
[71:16.34]Let's take another look.
[71:18.00]Let's take another look.
[71:20.94]What about this thing?
[71:21.96]I didn't mean to ruin your big moment.
[71:23.74]It's okay, really.
[71:26.15]How about I make it up to you?
[71:27.27]Come on, you're supposed to be like the techie.
[71:33.47]You can't like open this up and take the battery out and use it to power something.
[71:37.85]I don't even know what to do with that.
[71:40.21]anything you want what's going on down here uh where's everybody else I'll go get them why don't you just chill out here what's that hey you seen my brother or fliss uh no I got distracted let's go get him sure so which one is uh you know where the magic happens
[72:09.32]Where is Italics?
[72:10.14]Is he upstairs now?
[72:11.70]Oh, no, that's Italics.
[72:19.30]Okay, that's enough of that.
[72:20.90]Hey, we're standing next to each other now.
[72:22.20]Conrad, beers.
[72:23.12]Where are they?
[72:23.70]We are, yes.
[72:24.66]Oh, yeah, the beers.
[72:26.64]I was just getting them now.
[72:31.82]Nice.
[72:32.54]There's four in there.
[72:34.60]We can all have one each.
[72:37.10]And that's it for the whole entire trip.
[72:45.71]Alright, now that everybody's here, let's take a look at the navigator's pad we found.
[72:50.17]Maybe we can figure out why the plane was out here.
[72:52.20]Where'd you put it?
[72:52.92]It's in your case.
[72:53.70]Okay, I'll go get it.
[72:55.22]Hey.
[72:57.58]Hey, uh... Hey, are you gonna say something?
[73:00.78]No.
[73:00.90]Oh, shit.
[73:03.12]I think I like this.
[73:04.30]I think I accidentally... Okay, there it is.
[73:08.92]I'm talking about your adventure.
[73:11.10]Wait, you saw a shark?
[73:12.20]I did see a shark, yeah.
[73:13.14]I thought it was you.
[73:14.24]It almost got me.
[73:31.41]so does the accident mean we can't do any more diving let me just say this once more for the record going into that plane was super dangerous obviously and twice as illegal where are you now damage is done so we just have to lie about it forever um or else we're gonna go to I'm exploring oh well my lips are sealed so we're going again tomorrow
[73:58.19]I thought I was going to learn something there.
[74:00.67]You should be looking at this because that's just all of our adventures.
[74:02.95]We all get to stay in the boat.
[74:05.50]I think it's too dangerous.
[74:06.34]I think it's too dangerous to go in the water.
[74:12.84]I didn't even get to do anything.
[74:16.84]Barbecue.
[74:22.97]Uh, yeah.
[74:25.03]Are you with me?
[74:25.91]No, I'm talking to Conrad.
[74:27.47]Good.
[74:27.75]Good.
[74:28.17]Oh, it's another boat just rolled up.
[74:31.09]Hey!
[74:31.27]Yeah, I know, right?
[74:33.07]That's how I feel.
[74:33.81]What the heck?
[74:51.53]We got places to be and things to do.
[74:53.53]Here comes the drinks.
[74:55.21]Enjoy it.
[74:55.65]Alright, if you drink, you die.
[74:56.69]Guaranteed.
[74:57.71]The first person to take the sip is the person that we kill first.
[75:01.76]Check it out.
[75:02.60]I don't think we'll have to try.
[75:03.58]I think they'll just die.
[75:04.76]Screenshot that.
[75:06.06]Who wants to find some sunken treasure?
[75:07.68]So what do you think, Adam?
[75:10.70]Coordinates?
[75:11.78]Those are coordinates, alright.
[75:13.51]Maybe the plane's destination?
[75:15.15]You think we could get there by tomorrow?
[75:17.37]Is this what I found underwater?
[75:20.19]I think so.
[75:21.51]There was a flight plan on board that seemed to indicate it was a rescue plane.
[75:24.79]Yeah, that makes sense.
[75:26.39]After the war, they turned long-range bombers into rescue planes.
[75:28.77]And then this plane must have been shot down because it was riddled with bullet holes.
[75:32.29]I found one lodged in a fuselage.
[75:34.31]And it was full of life rafts.
[75:35.47]It must have gotten shot down before they could deliver all the rafts.
[75:38.35]There was only one missing.
[75:39.59]From the photos Alex took, you can see the flight badge on one of the corpses.
[75:42.90]That means the crew is from the Conwin Island, smack dab in the middle of the Pacific Theater.
[75:47.78]Called it.
[75:48.52]Reckless.
[75:49.18]All of you.
[75:50.04]Excuse me?
[75:50.88]I told you to leave everything down there alone.
[75:53.10]Oh, come on.
[75:53.94]We've been through this already.
[75:55.08]I'm not talking about the law.
[76:02.16]Then what?
[76:03.90]Superstition?
[76:05.04]Is that it?
[76:05.63]Really?
[76:07.35]Constant conflict.
[76:08.33]Constant conflict.
[76:09.27]Hmm.
[76:09.39]Hmm.
[76:26.16]Okay.
[76:26.55]Okay.
[76:27.51]Maybe.
[76:28.17]True, but I'm lying.
[76:29.03]I don't know you.
[76:29.91]Oh, you're lying.
[76:30.63]You should have never gone down to that plane in the first place.
[76:33.65]It's bad luck.
[76:34.87]You think you can scavenge down there and it makes no difference, but every single thing you bring back has an essence.
[76:40.30]It's like a ghost you invite to the surface.
[76:41.96]Here we go.
[76:42.82]Huh.
[76:43.86]I never thought about it like that.
[76:45.14]You never think about much of anything.
[76:46.50]Well, maybe I never heard about such cool ghost stories.
[76:48.80]They're not cool ghost stories.
[76:51.20]Not like for fun.
[76:53.04]People drown in these waters and you have to respect their resting place.
[76:56.32]Damn straight.
[76:58.02]Brett, you got a fun ghost story, right?
[77:05.55]Yeah, I heard a story.
[77:06.83]Happened right around here, too.
[77:08.81]Let's hear it.
[77:09.93]We could all use a good show.
[77:15.22]I'm turning this character around.
[77:17.40]I bet you can spin a good yarn.
[77:19.27]It's kind of messed up, actually.
[77:22.69]Scare away, little bro.
[77:24.17]Okay, here goes.
[77:26.51]This story is true.
[77:28.01]It had happened right near here, in an old lighthouse.
[77:31.15]Classic setup.
[77:32.17]Wait, true story?
[77:34.28]Where'd you hear this?
[77:36.16]Wait, can somebody take a sip out of their fucking beer?
[77:39.44]Are you making up the story to go along?
[77:42.03]ah well down by the dock dude these are empty where'd you get these skin like a leather book eye patch wooden leg the whole nine yards and for a dollar he told me his secrets okay here we go the lighthouse stood atop an atoll isolated from the rest of the world a lone beacon in the night a sailor's respite the lighthouse keeper would hear the waves pounding the rocky shore
[78:07.48]one misty morning he comes upon a woman covered in blood she's stumbling down the beach he hurries to her aid and she falls into his arms sobbing as he hurries her back to the lighthouse he asks where she's from he doesn't waste any time smooth let me interject he of the one track mind
[78:30.08]The woman answers.
[78:31.78]That's what you had to do?
[78:33.39]That's what I had to do.
[78:34.15]Just give, like, a response?
[78:36.89]I was doing, um... It's pretty popular nowadays.
[78:41.37]You just watch a video and then you say two things about it and that's the whole stream.
[78:45.27]So, they go to the top of the lighthouse and there, splayed on the floor, is a man and a woman brutally murdered with an axe.
[78:52.88]Always an axe.
[78:54.04]I mean, do people even use axes anymore?
[78:59.91]Okay, fine.
[79:00.57]Then it was a meat hook.
[79:02.27]They were slashed with a meat hook and hung from the rafters.
[79:09.30]Wait a minute.
[79:09.76]Are you changing the murder weapon?
[79:11.26]I thought this was a true story.
[79:12.52]A lot of blood.
[79:13.06]A lot of carnage.
[79:15.40]Things get told over generations.
[79:16.96]You lose a little bit of detail.
[79:19.10]Who did it?
[79:26.43]The woman says, it was my brother.
[79:29.23]And she turns to the closet and says, he's hiding in there.
[79:32.47]Ah, great.
[79:33.85]Blame the brother.
[79:35.53]So the lighthouse keeper creeps over to the closet, opens the door, and sure enough, there's a man inside.
[79:43.54]But he sliced out his own insides with a meat hook.
[79:46.90]Horrified, he looks closer to see the dead man's face in the dark.
[79:50.96]Closer.
[79:52.54]Closer.
[79:54.10]And he sees.
[79:55.46]It's his own face.
[79:58.18]And then its eyes bulge out and screams.
[80:00.88]Nice play, Big.
[80:04.39]So gross.
[80:05.41]Super twist.
[80:06.15]Nice.
[80:09.49]Nice one, Squire.
[80:20.03]Thunder.
[80:20.89]Summoning thunder.
[80:24.31]Okay, you've all had your fun.
[80:27.67]We should all turn in.
[80:28.51]There's some weather hitting our way.
[80:29.71]Uh-uh.
[80:30.41]No, no, no.
[80:30.91]No, because according to standard vessel regulation, we're all required one more beer before hitting the hay.
[80:35.43]What regulations are these?
[80:37.07]It's standard issue regulatory institutional protocol subdivision 1099.
[80:42.40]Uh-huh.
[80:43.86]Where'd you read that?
[80:45.08]The internet.
[80:45.54]Oh, so you found a website that tells you to drink beer under every circumstance.
[80:48.80]I'm just following orders, man.
[80:50.46]I'm into this website.
[80:51.62]10-4, good buddy.
[80:52.80]And I'm out.
[80:56.59]Ugh.
[81:00.73]Yep.
[81:01.71]Yep.
[81:02.45]Well.
[81:03.41]You really can't add anything to that.
[81:05.19]No, nothing to add to that one.
[81:12.38]By the way, this ship's gonna sink.
[81:16.24]Like, imminently.
[81:17.40]Yes.
[81:18.82]No, I mean, seriously, I saw a photo.
[81:27.76]All right.
[81:30.64]Storm incoming.
[81:32.72]Is this like the Kingdom Hearts characters?
[81:36.16]Scary guy.
[81:46.78]It's Mickey.
[81:57.41]Oh!
[81:59.29]Is this like, is this you?
[82:01.21]I'm on the bed.
[82:04.62]I punched a guy in the face.
[82:05.96]Oh.
[82:11.42]So about that boat from earlier.
[82:13.24]About, uh, that, this, they were just, no.
[82:17.40]Was it the same people?
[82:18.41]I don't think so.
[82:19.75]I can't tell.
[82:21.31]They're in like hoods.
[82:23.69]Well, it's raining outside.
[82:32.90]Oh Oh All right, what's your decision?
[82:58.45]Captain
[83:09.74]You would choose the captain when you're all tied up.
[83:12.02]You gotta choose the captain.
[83:13.98]The captain, that's the decision maker.
[83:20.47]Just keep the tape on my mouth.
[83:25.73]Don't take it off me.
[83:29.96]Of course he chooses her.
[83:30.96]Yeah, they're brother and sister.
[83:31.94]Why wouldn't I choose brother and sister?
[83:35.65]That's like Deadpool in Wolverine Origins.
[83:39.29]We both can't talk.
[83:46.51]We didn't think this through.
[83:48.47]Neither of us can speak.
[83:49.19]Hold on, what's going on?
[83:50.21]What was that whole scenario?
[83:53.87]I didn't un-gag you, and you didn't un-gag me, so we both can't talk.
[83:59.22]Is that what we were supposed to be doing?
[84:02.14]Yeah, I got the captain, because I... That's like we play it.
[84:21.41]Ow!
[84:22.29]Oh, it hurts!
[84:23.35]Hmm.
[84:24.87]Hmm.
[84:25.21]Hmm.
[84:30.94]Why does that always hurt?
[84:36.60]No one's ever had that in a movie taken off and go... The bad news is these are kind of maybe the fishermen I pissed off earlier.
[84:44.23]Oh, God damn it, Conrad.
[84:45.89]Great.
[84:46.51]Just great.
[84:47.37]And the good news?
[84:48.79]I recognize them.
[84:49.97]How was that good news?
[84:50.99]I thought you were going to ask the good news first.
[84:52.63]You're such an idiot, Jesus.
[84:58.21]We have to get free right now.
[85:01.24]So are you seeing what I'm seeing?
[85:02.50]Or are you in a different room?
[85:04.47]No, you're Alex, right?
[85:06.37]Yeah.
[85:06.57]Yeah, I mean Brad's.
[85:09.13]You're what?
[85:09.75]Are you... Yeah, I'm Alex and... Who are you playing as?
[85:15.33]Conrad.
[85:16.16]Yeah.
[85:24.20]You're gonna regret this, you piece of shit.
[85:26.54]You're gonna rot in a cell.
[85:30.58]No, I know I'm Conrad.
[85:31.52]I didn't know if he was controlling anybody in this room.
[85:33.30]I didn't know if you were anybody, somebody else.
[85:44.33]I'll be back for you later.
[85:49.07]I tried to help.
[85:50.15]I tried to help.
[85:51.86]See you later.
[85:52.36]Nobody knows you're out here, little lady.
[85:58.28]You're all alone with us now.
[86:00.92]There's no QTE there.
[86:02.18]I would have dodged it.
[86:02.90]This guy just... seriously.
[86:33.87]Uh, alright, I... I'm gonna try to save this.
[86:38.47]Oh, no.
[86:47.54]Don't do it.
[86:54.56]Uh...
[87:01.78]Nah, when he opens his mouth, bad things happen.
[87:07.94]Should've kept the tape on my mouth.
[87:24.11]Kill Conrad.
[87:28.35]Yeah.
[87:28.89]Mm-hmm.
[87:30.01]Mm-hmm.
[87:30.75]Just... Sure.
[87:32.69]Just... But not...
[87:41.65]You would not believe what I just saw.
[87:43.55]They got fucking... There's a carnival up there.
[87:46.63]There's clowns.
[87:47.83]There is food and shit.
[87:49.76]It's really... It's kind of fun.
[87:51.86]Really?
[87:52.26]Did you see what I saw?
[87:53.08]It was pretty interesting.
[87:56.00]That's, uh... Considering I was watching half the things that happened through this looking glass.
[88:03.78]They're just traveling clowns.
[88:06.42]Shut the fuck up.
[88:09.03]That's good news.
[88:10.79]Alright, here we go.
[88:11.39]What's the game plan here?
[88:12.47]I don't know.
[88:13.39]I have no idea what's happening right now.
[88:16.97]I just was sitting in the room.
[88:40.21]Oh, that's you.
[88:40.73]You're controlling.
[88:41.39]We found some scissors while you were gone.
[88:43.63]Oh, that's good.
[88:44.07]So you have... Do you have scissors?
[88:44.83]I think I still have scissors.
[88:46.53]Do you have a weapon?
[89:12.02]Like a man and yeah, that's the guy that's that's the guy telling the story.
[89:15.08]That's a guy writing in the book.
[89:16.50]He's watching He's he's clown too.
[89:20.81]Yeah, he's making sure that we make the right decision How much money they have
[89:44.95]Yeah, they said that to do the full juggling act it was gonna be $1,500.
[89:48.53]We need to make sure we can pay for it.
[90:01.91]So the next part of this game is a real-time reenactment of what it's like to be a hostage on a boat for 24 hours.
[90:09.86]We're just gonna sit here and shit our pants.
[90:11.72]Yeah.
[90:14.95]Yeah, it's a speedboat.
[90:16.31]The main guy here, he's got a gun.
[90:18.48]Okay, there's a gun.
[90:20.38]We've got scissors versus gun.
[90:23.56]Keep that in mind.
[90:27.52]Well, at least one of us can get on their boat.
[90:30.26]Get some help.
[90:34.97]If you can distract them, I can get on that boat.
[90:38.21]The dude with the gun won't even realize until I'm long gone.
[90:41.48]Seven seconds.
[90:43.02]I can get out through the window.
[90:44.22]Gotta break these off first.
[90:45.22]Too loud.
[90:46.24]They'll hear it.
[90:46.66]We can do it.
[90:47.00]We're gonna break them during the thunder.
[90:48.49]During the thunder.
[90:49.43]Good call.
[90:50.97]Hey, where's the brother?
[90:51.97]He can just tell another scary story.
[90:55.25]Just break the window.
[90:56.67]Stay focused and get to the boat.
[91:00.73]Alright, here we go.
[91:03.48]Do I have to break it?
[91:04.08]Do you have to break it?
[91:05.46]Time it with the lightning, remember?
[91:10.22]Wait.
[91:11.40]Hold on.
[91:12.26]With the thunder, right?
[91:21.92]What?
[91:22.78]Why would you do that?
[91:24.07]Why wouldn't you wait for the next thunder?
[91:25.37]It's gonna happen again.
[91:26.03]Uh-oh.
[91:43.30]Is that me?
[91:44.96]I was supposed to stab him.
[91:46.78]What?
[91:48.14]No, this is me.
[91:50.38]Give me the knife.
[91:53.66]Get him.
[91:55.10]All right.
[91:58.79]Drop it, Buster.
[92:02.73]It's amateur hour over here.
[92:04.05]All right, we've got our own hostage.
[92:06.25]I got this.
[92:07.33]Let me handle it.
[92:12.37]What's going on out here?
[92:19.02]Wait, do you have one too?
[92:21.40]I've got my own hostage.
[92:27.41]You have hostages?
[92:29.41]These guys suck.
[92:30.67]These are the worst boat infiltrators ever.
[92:34.83]We both have hostages.
[92:36.71]Let's finish this.
[92:38.65]He's trying to kill me or something.
[92:46.44]Alright, I'm going for the gun.
[92:48.16]Be ready.
[92:49.58]Oh, that didn't work.
[92:51.68]What?
[92:52.16]How could you?
[92:53.24]You still have your hostage, though, right?
[92:54.79]Still got one hostage.
[92:55.79]We got a car to place.
[92:57.03]You still got an ace.
[93:00.03]No!
[93:01.31]Alex, this is crazy.
[93:07.42]Get off our boat.
[93:09.28]Ha!
[93:09.46]You're a fool.
[93:12.07]I'm the captain now.
[93:14.67]Really?
[93:15.41]Really?
[93:19.58]Get these assholes out of here.
[93:21.80]Uh-oh.
[93:29.34]Uh-oh.
[93:31.70]Hey, I can't let sister die.
[93:34.09]No.
[93:36.55]Night for night.
[93:38.25]Get off our boat.
[93:39.35]What?
[93:41.09]An eye for an eye.
[93:42.01]No!
[93:44.15]What happened?
[93:45.13]Who got shot?
[93:48.55]Who?
[93:50.97]What happened?
[93:51.67]Why did you let that happen?
[93:54.52]Why do you go to the gym every day, Alex, if not for this?
[93:58.06]What?
[94:00.52]Bring them downstairs.
[94:02.66]Take this.
[94:04.20]Use it if you have to.
[94:07.96]Hold on, wait.
[94:08.51]Did you...
[94:12.23]Did somebody get shot?
[94:13.97]Yeah.
[94:15.83]He got shot in the leg.
[94:16.77]He's fine.
[94:19.09]No, who got shot?
[94:20.73]Sit.
[94:22.11]Now.
[94:23.45]Upstairs, the girl who's pointing the gun at him.
[94:27.58]I can't believe we had two hostages and we didn't get that.
[94:30.16]Julia's dead?
[94:31.28]Yeah.
[94:33.76]He shot her.
[94:35.50]Oh, no.
[94:35.68]Yeah, but didn't you, like, shove him out of the way?
[94:38.59]I thought that's what happened.
[94:44.84]I... Why am I getting blamed for this?
[94:53.35]We had two hostages in control of the situation.
[94:56.51]I didn't lose the first hostage.
[95:00.54]Why am I getting the blame?
[95:02.64]I did lose the first hostage, but I was going for the gun.
[95:20.92]What?
[95:21.48]It's okay.
[95:22.74]See?
[95:23.30]Hold on.
[95:23.76]Wait, wait, wait.
[95:24.20]So she's got shot in the face?
[95:27.16]What happened?
[95:27.59]You guys are overreacting.
[95:30.07]We're good.
[95:31.63]This is basically the same thing that would happen if we just let them go.
[95:40.66]We would have still been hostages if we let them go.
[95:42.68]We're hostages now, so.
[95:43.62]How could we have been so stupid?
[95:46.02]If we're lucky, it's not worse.
[95:48.08]We could have been killed.
[95:52.68]What were you thinking?
[95:53.54]Me?
[95:53.60]This isn't just about you, Julia.
[96:00.65]We could have turned it around and we wouldn't be in this mess right now.
[96:03.73]All right.
[96:04.91]Shut the fuck up!
[96:10.88]I'm not gonna take that from you.
[96:12.68]We're just talking.
[96:16.14]Alright, can we get two more hostages again?
[96:19.57]I wonder if we can get two hostages.
[96:24.53]This time let's go for two hostages and we're gonna play it correct this time.
[96:29.59]What?
[96:34.55]S!
[96:34.91]I have a controller in my hand.
[96:36.69]There's no S on my controller.
[96:39.65]Sit still, all of you.
[96:44.93]You, come with me.
[96:49.48]Ask a secret.
[96:50.20]What the hell is this?
[96:55.60]Find out how long the storm is gonna last.
[96:59.92]Will you try anything?
[97:01.64]Anything, Fisher.
[97:02.36]All right, what do I do here?
[97:03.18]And there'll be consequences.
[97:07.04]Get it.
[97:08.36]Okay.
[97:10.31]I gotta say, like, the secret code to get help.
[97:12.19]You've got Milan requesting weather update.
[97:15.56]Over.
[97:17.24]We read you.
[97:18.08]Everything okay?
[97:19.28]Over.
[97:19.90]It'd be like, Duke of Milan, uh, seeking... Here we go.
[97:23.40]Um, how bad is the storm?
[97:25.20]Hey, uh, just requesting any information about this storm you can give us.
[97:29.59]It's a little bit hairy out here.
[97:30.55]It's a little bit hairy out here.
[97:31.61]Over.
[97:31.85]There's gotta be a code.
[97:33.71]There's a storm coming in from the east.
[97:35.29]It's gonna hit you pretty hard.
[97:36.37]It should pass through your coordinates within an hour.
[97:39.62]So obvious.
[98:12.08]Do I get to move around up here?
[98:16.90]Oh my god.
[98:18.84]He just saved me.
[98:19.98]He just fucking rescued me.
[98:23.75]You want to talk about like scripted event where she can't die?
[98:31.35]Even the fucking bad guy just reached his hand out and saved my life.
[98:46.11]What are you doing?
[98:48.86]What are you stabbing?
[98:49.80]What the fuck?
[99:08.95]I gotta help.
[99:10.65]No, I gotta hold.
[99:12.21]Alright, this is putting more...
[99:15.75]All right, this is important.
[99:16.75]We got to work together here.
[99:18.57]Okay.
[99:20.89]We're all in the same room.
[99:23.09]I got hit in the face with a frying pan.
[99:24.83]What the fuck, Alex?
[99:25.94]Not the time.
[99:27.20]You were gone.
[99:27.68]Good job looking after number one.
[99:29.00]In the face.
[99:29.74]Real smooth.
[99:31.18]Great leadership, Flick.
[99:33.78]So Alex isn't feeling too hot, right?
[99:37.88]This is so hot.
[99:38.34]Yeah, it got louder.
[99:41.06]I don't trust this guy to drive.
[99:42.58]He doesn't have any depth perception.
[99:46.18]It's funny because I trust this guy, because he literally saved my life.
[99:52.10]I got, uh, I got scripted.
[99:53.10]Everybody would have just planted against there and insta-died, by the way.
[100:14.92]All of us would have flown into the side of that.
[100:17.02]Our boat would have capsized immediately.
[100:18.68]Everyone's still alive.
[100:21.54]Things could have been quite different.
[100:23.50]We did a good job.
[100:31.72]Frustrated.
[100:32.32]He wants more carnage.
[100:36.66]Everybody's still alive.
[100:38.78]Kind-hearted creature I am, I'd like to offer you some forewarning of what's to come.
[100:45.50]Tempted?
[100:48.92]Should we... Should we... Say nothing.
[100:52.34]Say nothing.
[100:52.82]Prefer... Do we want a tip?
[100:57.31]No.
[100:58.03]No tips.
[100:59.03]Did I choose or did you... Someone can't decide.
[101:01.39]Uh-oh.
[101:01.63]That doesn't bode well.
[101:03.65]I said say nothing.
[101:04.59]I said I don't...
[101:07.37]Anyway, now that you've reached a point of significant distress, I presume you're eager to get back to your story.
[101:15.41]But here's the thing.
[101:17.86]Everything may not be entirely as it seems.
[101:21.94]Yeah, Mom, I know I have to do homework.
[101:23.96]You came right in the middle of the movie and turned on the lights and started talking.
[101:28.62]Mom, I want to watch the movie again.
[101:29.77]You shouldn't have said that.
[101:31.51]Yeah, but the trash is full.
[101:33.41]It's like, all right, fine, I'll do it.
[101:37.88]And then she goes to the bookcase and pulls out your favorite book, and it's hollowed out with a whiskey bottle.
[101:42.27]She starts chugging right in front of you.
[101:46.65]Jesus.
[102:03.30]Alright, here we go.
[102:13.05]So where's the... Is Tom Hanks in this one?
[102:16.83]Should we try to keep everybody alive?
[102:19.97]Even the bad guys?
[102:23.23]Even the bad guys.
[102:27.64]At this point, I don't know what it takes to kill anybody.
[102:32.81]I really thought somebody was dead in the hostage seat.
[102:36.29]I thought I... Yeah, it looked like somebody got shot in the face.
[102:51.70]Did they really have to show all of us doing that?
[102:54.36]It was like loading the next gameplay segment.
[102:57.36]Jesus.
[103:07.43]So are we all friends now?
[103:12.27]Because they're not pointing guns at us anymore.
[103:14.03]Apparently.
[103:17.03]Apparently we're just in this together now.
[103:23.05]Alright, so we figured out who we are.
[103:27.23]I'm Conrad.
[103:29.51]I'm Julian.
[103:33.25]Why are you faster than me?
[103:38.18]Just am.
[103:39.10]Is it a flashlight?
[103:45.45]What is this?
[103:49.25]This looks like signatures from... Hey!
[103:52.21]Hey!
[103:52.37]What the fuck?
[103:53.29]That was, like, information.
[103:55.09]Why would you do that?
[103:56.77]They didn't finish writing that lore.
[103:59.84]I mean, wouldn't you have wanted to know that?
[104:03.68]Did you think I was gonna hit you in the head with a clipboard?
[104:09.57]That may have been very, very important information.
[104:11.55]All right, this is a really cool, like, Disney interactive experience ride line.
[104:18.96]Keep moving!
[104:21.22]With the actors, too, that are like, keep moving!
[104:24.10]Ooh, that was scary.
[104:25.48]Pirates of the Caribbean.
[104:27.22]They're right there!
[104:27.82]In the modern era.
[104:28.84]I just got yelled at!
[104:31.26]What do we... What was that?
[104:34.10]Handcuffs?
[104:35.24]Wait.
[104:37.86]Wait, we can't go that way?
[104:47.43]Comrades from Salem, Massachusetts.
[104:51.70]Oops, I dropped my handcuffs.
[104:57.08]I just don't know where you want me to go.
[104:58.88]There might actually be clowns.
[105:06.31]Supermassive loves clowns, so I mean... Yeah, there might be clowns.
[105:11.97]I'm just like AI pathing algorithm.
[105:17.95]I'm not even a person.
[105:23.72]What are you looking at?
[105:31.60]I was looking at some clothes, clothes.
[105:35.20]What is anything?
[105:36.29]Anything there we're looking at?
[105:39.55]Just some clothes.
[105:40.85]You already looked at it then.
[105:43.37]Decided I wasn't ready to buy anything yet.
[105:47.38]Just browsing, leave me alone.
[105:56.74]What was that?
[106:03.14]Can we investigate?
[106:10.26]Hey!
[106:14.49]What?
[106:14.87]I moved two steps.
[106:17.07]What's going on?
[106:19.57]I'm creating a situation and I don't know how.
[106:22.09]This is so dumb.
[106:29.42]I love it.
[106:33.01]Let me go that way.
[106:33.73]I'll go this way.
[106:35.49]This is gonna get knocked out of my hand.
[106:50.90]Do they know where we are right now?
[106:54.52]There's gonna be some knowledge here.
[106:56.42]They know the secret.
[106:57.78]They know what happened.
[106:59.46]And they know what's down here.
[107:07.06]We should have killed those hostages when we had the chance.
[107:14.70]He's actually going to give us a lift.
[107:18.15]Now we can really tell ghost stories.
[107:19.69]He's kind of a nice guy, actually.
[107:22.85]I kind of sweet talked him on the boat.
[107:26.53]Wait, you had that the whole time?
[107:27.75]Why didn't you just put alcohol in your mouth and just spray it with the lighter into the guy's face?
[107:39.99]What the hell is this fucking place?
[107:47.90]Dude, even those meatheads seem spooked.
[107:55.84]You think this ship is the Manchurian Gold?
[107:58.52]I do.
[107:58.80]We are in the vicinity of those coordinates.
[108:04.03]It's still safe to this day.
[108:07.41]How did nobody die, by the way?
[108:09.25]I'm trying to figure that out.
[108:10.25]There's gotta be a big finale.
[108:11.13]One of the options was, I'm hurt too bad.
[108:33.36]Is Conrad really hurt right now?
[108:35.18]Did you do something?
[108:36.06]No.
[108:36.14]I guess I got punched in the face once or twice.
[108:37.82]Yeah, you got punched in the face like once or twice.
[108:39.76]In layman's terms, please.
[108:40.96]There we are.
[108:41.28]Glasses guy has to explain it.
[109:02.01]It's an essential part of the engine.
[109:03.46]We're not taking the Duke of Milan anywhere without it.
[109:06.36]It's like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hold on.
[109:07.72]Can I see your glasses for a second?
[109:09.44]Yeah, sure.
[109:09.90]Can you say that again?
[109:11.58]I don't know anything about anything. ...
[109:30.21]Um, 24 British archaeologists have gone missing.
[109:35.57]What?
[109:35.93]I did?
[109:52.38]Sounds like this guy is mad at another guy named Patterson for playing sick to get out of guard duty.
[109:58.64]Oh, found a way out.
[110:01.16]I guess it's like the third time that happened.
[110:03.86]They really must not have liked it in the cargo hold.
[110:05.78]In the cargo hold?
[110:08.90]What the hell?
[110:10.42]I think Conrad found something.
[110:12.30]I'm going to check it out.
[110:13.28]Love dialogue.
[110:15.42]Wait, hold on.
[110:17.50]What?
[110:17.84]Why did it just...
[110:20.59]Because I found something.
[110:21.73]It's more important than whatever you're talking about.
[110:23.91]Apparently.
[110:24.49]Do we need both people over there?
[110:28.94]Hold on.
[110:29.86]Wait, were you over here?
[110:32.58]I'm looking at glasses.
[110:46.25]And they don't know what to do when you, like, push A. That is a map, I think.
[110:58.21]Got a map.
[111:05.43]Why?
[111:05.97]Come take a look.
[111:06.77]What?
[111:08.79]Are we trying?
[111:09.25]Is this you?
[111:09.63]We're, like, ripping each other out of our cutscenes.
[111:14.81]Was that you that I just stepped in front of to look at this?
[111:22.03]There's a little dog, and the name's Chip Mascot.
[111:25.41]We don't know the name.
[111:27.63]Private Miller's letter.
[111:29.63]I'll be with you soon and get a job as a mechanic, and we can get married and have two children.
[111:33.37]We'll be happy together forever.
[111:35.85]Got it?
[111:38.97]All right.
[111:39.99]So who's going to have the stomachache?
[111:43.15]Oh, I can't.
[111:43.97]I can't.
[111:44.47]You gotta go through the vent like a spy.
[111:47.43]I can't get it open.
[111:49.11]Hey, come here.
[111:51.97]What's going on in there?
[111:53.73]Oh, I'm gonna puke.
[111:55.23]Oh, no, this is ridiculous.
[111:56.63]And they open up the door and then we jump them.
[111:59.87]Every video you actually puke up in.
[112:02.09]Freedom.
[112:04.11]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[112:04.65]We don't know where a vent like this would go.
[112:06.62]Everybody shut your pants.
[112:07.58]Go.
[112:09.46]That's not a bad idea.
[112:13.60]I think we just gotta find out.
[112:14.95]You want me to just smash through this wall?
[112:20.21]What?
[112:20.49]Alright, yeah, let's go.
[112:24.09]Oh, yeah, sure.
[112:25.03]Big man on campus.
[112:27.43]Someone should create a distraction.
[112:29.32]Here we go.
[112:29.62]This is gonna be loud.
[112:31.24]My stomach hurts.
[112:34.66]I got shot.
[112:35.70]Yeah, okay.
[112:36.82]Conrad.
[112:37.38]You can feel good.
[112:39.98]Dude, the classic stomach ache.
[112:41.05]Come on.
[112:44.75]Alright, I'm going for smart.
[112:46.99]Well, never mind.
[112:47.51]We're going... Yep.
[112:48.36]Come on.
[112:50.62]Stomach ache.
[112:51.98]Stomach hurts.
[112:55.46]Hey!
[112:56.34]Yeah, you.
[112:57.02]Long John Silver and shit.
[112:58.38]What are you guys doing out there?
[113:00.12]Pieces of eight and shiver me timbers, you one-legged fuck faces.
[113:03.26]Yeah, you smarmy varmints.
[113:04.94]Yeah, no, you.
[113:05.68]I'm gonna rip your pirate parents off your shoulders and stomp them into rainbow-colored stew.
[113:10.61]That was a little kick.
[113:12.15]I'm warning you.
[113:13.48]Do we do a bigger kick?
[113:14.40]This is all improv.
[113:15.36]They're not even gonna attempt, I guess.
[113:17.02]They're not even here anymore.
[113:18.89]They like went to go get lunch.
[113:44.01]Why are we all running?
[113:48.89]Replace it.
[113:51.87]Oh, nice move.
[113:57.47]Why would you not replace it?
[113:59.53]Because we had to get out of there quick.
[114:00.89]Uh-oh, she's about to go off the rails.
[114:15.95]Don't barricade.
[114:16.97]Use that as a weapon.
[114:18.87]That was huge and heavy.
[114:20.59]There's only one person with a gun.
[114:25.35]It wasn't that guy.
[114:27.78]Look, they can't shoot all of us.
[114:30.34]Everyone just charge them.
[114:33.40]I thought I was you first.
[114:36.72]Oh, shit.
[114:38.54]What have I done?
[114:39.66]I've done it.
[114:41.13]It's been a while since our last pause.
[114:49.22]Action.
[114:50.84]Alright, you take that way.
[114:51.72]I'm going to take this way.
[114:56.34]Let's check in here.
[114:57.16]Just keep moving.
[115:04.36]No, I don't want to keep moving.
[115:06.12]What if there's like medpacks in here?
[115:14.17]Oh, fragrant.
[115:16.19]All right, where's reach in and dig around?
[115:31.38]Press S.
[115:34.63]I see you.
[115:35.82]I see you coming in.
[115:36.52]I was trying to come in, and it wouldn't let me, but I couldn't see you.
[115:40.16]So I just thought I was getting bounced off the wall.
[115:42.64]You just did the, I'm a guaranteed player-controlled character.
[115:48.30]That's like the second time they've done that.
[115:51.90]What, did you get, like, ratsed?
[115:53.56]Yeah.
[115:54.26]Or batsed.
[115:55.78]I got ratsed.
[116:09.94]All right, well, nothing in here.
[116:10.90]We don't really see, there's no sense of urgency right now.
[116:17.91]Yeah, well, the thing is, like, all the other characters, the NPCs are just standing awkwardly in the middle of the hallway.
[116:24.90]I just want to know where the hell they are.
[116:26.06]I feel like I'm playing Spy Party.
[116:27.36]There should have been dozens of people on board.
[116:29.24]That's what I was saying.
[116:30.46]I would have absolutely, I would have sniped you right there, because there was no way you were an AI.
[116:35.30]I mean, yeah, there's no way you were actually, like, you were definitely player-controlled.
[116:40.77]All right, well, this seems important.
[116:42.21]What did he say?
[116:42.70]I don't know.
[116:46.70]Probably doesn't matter.
[116:50.34]What was that?
[116:51.68]What was that?
[116:52.28]I just knocked the board off the wall.
[116:54.84]But I didn't do that.
[116:55.72]It just fell.
[116:58.06]The ghost.
[116:58.86]I can't go in there.
[117:02.20]I got another rat scare.
[117:07.68]I didn't touch anything.
[117:11.06]Are you in this room too?
[117:12.86]Are you in the bathroom?
[117:13.56]No.
[117:14.98]I gotta go for now.
[117:15.80]There's some commotion outside.
[117:17.12]That usually means I'm about to be real busy for a while.
[117:19.12]I'll write again soon.
[117:20.90]There's a little boy on board and it sounds like Ted.
[117:23.91]Oh, I am in the bathroom.
[117:25.11]I was just messing with you.
[117:25.85]There ain't no way we got a stowaway.
[117:27.53]Alright, you keep looking in the bathroom.
[117:30.03]You keep finding secrets.
[117:31.05]I haven't found any of these.
[117:36.92]It's creepy NPCs.
[117:39.16]What?
[117:42.06]The captain is always like two steps in front of me, just waiting for me.
[117:45.40]That wasn't you?
[117:48.16]That was not you?
[117:48.72]I thought that was your shadow.
[117:54.02]Oh, I see.
[117:54.44]I saw that.
[117:56.34]I'm trying to get to it.
[117:57.30]These are like tank controls.
[118:01.59]We have split up to a point where I don't even know where... Oh, there you are.
[118:06.35]There you are.
[118:07.13]This place is fucking massive.
[118:09.41]Is it super massive?
[118:11.56]Good luck leaving.
[118:12.98]Wait, how did you... What?
[118:15.26]Good luck leaving.
[118:28.55]The something scary just happened music played, but I didn't see anything.
[118:31.95]I saw the guy.
[118:34.14]The guy?
[118:34.90]Yeah.
[118:35.37]You aren't seeing, like... I ain't seeing nothing, man.
[118:38.01]I read, like, one document.
[118:39.67]Are you gonna, like, hide in a closet and am I gonna, like, shoot you again?
[118:44.07]Hope not.
[118:46.87]I shouldn't have hid.
[118:47.69]I should have just stayed out in the open.
[118:50.77]How do you read books?
[118:51.67]I'm waiting for you to open it so I can read over your shoulder.
[118:54.63]It won't open.
[118:55.31]That's actually what's happening.
[119:01.50]There's structural problems with the ship.
[119:04.40]Some electronic equipment is malfunctioning.
[119:08.05]I saw a clown down the hallway.
[119:10.25]Cleaned the floor.
[119:11.55]Added lead to the soldiers.
[119:13.39]Spell book.
[119:15.65]Very informative.
[119:22.85]Hey, I found something over here.
[119:32.56]What is that?
[119:34.39]A tooth?
[119:34.73]Alright, I found a dinosaur tooth.
[119:39.57]Okay, now I gotta find something cool.
[119:44.94]No, it's a dinosaur head.
[119:51.12]Check out that dinosaur head.
[119:51.86]That's a dinosaur head.
[119:55.80]I only find books.
[120:01.63]One of them's gotta have whiskey in it.
[120:03.20]Uh-oh, there's a painting here.
[120:06.02]Oh, this one's long.
[120:08.59]Why is there a flashlight in my book?
[120:12.71]I don't even know who that was.
[120:14.45]It's got multiple pages?
[120:16.35]I don't have time for this.
[120:17.28]Do you want me to tell you a story?
[120:24.18]Sure.
[120:25.16]No, you don't want to hear it.
[120:32.95]All right, why was it just completely silent that whole time?
[120:38.29]That was weird.
[120:39.98]Nobody said a word.
[120:41.88]Like none of our party, they were just kind of walking.
[120:43.74]Everyone was just walking with their mouth closed.
[120:45.94]It's because they don't want the other bad guys to... Well, I guess I won't read the rest of that book.
[120:55.85]Did I get left behind?
[120:56.99]I don't know, did you?
[120:58.51]There's someone down there on the right.
[121:05.05]This is very difficult to multi-box.
[121:17.34]Hey, let's just put, like, four pages per book in everything you find, but you don't even have time to read it.
[121:23.00]What is that thing?
[121:23.72]What's with the sand castle builder?
[121:26.74]The, like, bucket.
[121:27.28]I don't understand.
[121:27.70]What is that for?
[121:28.75]Is it, like, the engine?
[121:29.81]The battery?
[121:30.61]The boat?
[121:31.49]It's a Burger King crop.
[121:34.53]Oh, the distributor cap.
[121:35.71]Right.
[121:36.45]Okay.
[121:47.25]All right.
[121:48.41]I think it's time for this guy to get Reed.
[121:50.41]You know what I mean?
[121:52.53]I thought we were sparing everyone the whole game.
[121:54.87]I'm gonna go get it.
[121:56.05]I... Now's the chance.
[122:01.60]Go get it.
[122:02.42]Wow, really?
[122:03.42]You're gonna fall for that?
[122:04.96]Okay.
[122:06.48]See ya.
[122:07.66]Keep an eye out.
[122:11.27]Oh, no.
[122:12.85]Is she gonna get Reed?
[122:21.57]Just get it.
[122:24.59]Did you make us do this?
[122:27.17]Yes.
[122:29.11]Just all of us go.
[122:32.57]You know which upper body strength that takes?
[122:36.70]Holy crap.
[122:41.24]All right.
[122:42.04]You and I are going to have to read this guy.
[122:44.54]Are you up or down?
[122:46.64]I'm up.
[122:50.13]Don't drop that.
[122:50.83]Get down.
[122:52.69]Throw it strategically to distract them.
[122:55.09]I'm trying to warn them.
[123:00.92]Okay, if you have the opportunity to read this guy, do it.
[123:04.12]I physically don't know who I'm supposed to be because I haven't made a decision in 10 minutes.
[123:14.01]Come here!
[123:14.27]Here we go.
[123:20.03]What?
[123:20.67]Goddammit, they're taking place.
[123:21.49]Shut the fuck up.
[123:23.01]What?
[123:23.71]What is going on?
[123:26.19]He doesn't have a weapon!
[123:27.39]That's the famous, like, one-handed chokehold!
[123:30.49]He doesn't have a weapon.
[123:32.69]Just- He's got a flashlight.
[123:34.05]So?
[123:35.67]And he's been drinking Gatorade.
[123:39.92]Wait.
[123:40.52]Arrête de crier, j'essaie d'entendre ce qui se passe.
[123:42.72]Je crie pas.
[123:43.50]What the fuck?
[123:44.28]La gueule.
[123:45.50]Je veux savoir où sont les autres.
[123:56.03]What if we just all get caught, get put back in the same room and escape the same way and have to do all this again?
[124:01.45]I didn't do that.
[124:06.06]Rowdy is deciding.
[124:07.14]This is... I like that they renamed this game.
[124:17.40]Oh, shit!
[124:19.02]No!
[124:20.48]It rolled right into him.
[124:22.24]I just led.
[124:27.94]Hey, at least I got him.
[124:28.98]At least I fucking chipped a tooth, that's all I care.
[124:30.26]Did we actually get put back in the room?
[124:31.42]See you later.
[124:57.81]Good luck.
[124:58.81]So he's Alex.
[125:21.46]What if I got too close and he did that to me from this way too?
[125:24.91]Get back there!
[125:43.88]Be ready.
[125:45.68]Take him out.
[125:46.44]Oh no.
[125:47.86]I'm gonna be ready to take him out.
[125:53.90]You picked the guy with the gun this time.
[125:59.27]Guy before had a flashlight.
[126:01.25]And you just like rolled backwards while he grabbed you by the neck.
[126:04.51]How are we gonna take the guy out with the fucking gun?
[126:20.82]I don't even think this guy knows where he's bringing us.
[126:23.60]Right now inside of his head he's going like, oh fuck.
[126:26.98]I actually have no idea where this is.
[126:29.48]I think it's over here.
[126:30.26]A hat on a stick.
[126:53.91]Now you tell us.
[126:58.67]Can I put the hat on?
[127:09.06]Medan.
[127:12.70]Bearing updated.
[127:13.66]What?
[127:17.69]It's Donald Duckhat?
[127:24.86]Holy shit.
[127:35.72]Can I walk him into that?
[127:37.30]Will he get steamed in the face?
[127:38.56]I don't know.
[127:48.55]That guy's still here.
[127:50.87]Well, that was like 70, that was like 80 years ago.
[128:10.30]I think that guy probably walked around for a little while.
[128:12.50]Maybe like a decade.
[128:14.61]And then was probably just like, I'm kind of done with the boat.
[128:17.07]And just like got in the ocean.
[128:18.83]And just started swimming.
[128:20.23]Ghost swimming.
[128:21.13]And is probably on land somewhere now.
[128:22.84]It's been like 20, 30, 40 years of that probably.
[128:25.02]I would do that if I was a ghost.
[128:27.54]Why would I stick around in the same place?
[128:41.69]To hunt.
[128:42.91]Fuck that.
[128:44.52]I want to see the ghost world.
[128:45.72]I'm going to stay inside of the closet here and scare the next 200 people that live in this house.
[128:52.40]No.
[128:53.55]I'm going to see the fucking whole ghost world.
[128:55.09]I'm not going to stay there.
[128:56.27]That doesn't sound like fun.
[128:59.41]What was that?
[129:11.59]Uh-oh.
[129:12.13]Painting.
[129:14.49]What?
[129:14.71]Wait, you want Luke?
[129:16.14]I gotta look at this painting, man.
[129:17.46]Like... I'm not even allowed to look at a painting.
[129:23.98]Oh, this place is cursed.
[129:25.34]It's so scary, it's a cursed place.
[129:26.75]Don't look at that fucking painting.
[129:29.75]You're allowed to have, like, an outwards monologue for everything here, but not us.
[129:40.43]Uh-oh, here comes incoming wreath.
[130:09.66]Jesus, man!
[130:10.38]It's just a door!
[130:13.86]It's just a steel wall, man!
[130:30.59]Where's the gun?
[130:35.38]I want the gun!
[130:45.06]Alright, so there's evil magician, evil wizard.
[130:51.15]Alright.
[130:52.51]Where's he gone?
[131:02.03]Where's he gone?
[131:20.52]I don't know why.
[131:21.00]You pick up the flashlight and another guy... Are you serious?
[131:30.55]Age 39.
[131:31.91]Warlock streamer.
[131:34.83]33.
[131:34.85]Come on, get it right.
[131:43.76]So we now have to... Ah, I didn't even give it a chance.
[131:53.39]Are they laughing?
[131:59.33]I don't know.
[132:07.06]It's been a long time.
[132:09.16]Is this gonna be Joe or Charlie or... Charles T. Perez.
[132:18.10]From Boston.
[132:21.02]Alright.
[132:21.86]This is Charlie.
[132:26.68]Hmm.
[132:27.74]Anything else?
[132:36.82]Okay.
[132:39.76]Oh, fuck.
[132:43.86]Yep.
[132:44.66]That's fucking Charlie.
[132:46.72]Yep.
[132:47.90]What?
[132:57.84]Oh, no, now I'm actually alone.
[133:00.40]Now I'm really alone.
[133:04.20]Hello?
[133:05.31]You can't... No, I don't want to be actually alone.
[133:10.85]What the fuck?
[133:19.40]Is Brad... Is Brad dead?
[133:22.32]That means Brad's dead.
[133:36.32]What is going on here?
[133:41.85]Quickly!
[133:42.23]Get the tooth.
[133:51.22]Oh shit.
[133:53.18]My phone's ringing.
[134:05.61]Hello?
[134:06.13]Uh-oh.
[134:10.83]Oh, wait, what?
[134:13.52]What do I do about this?
[134:14.18]Bee!
[134:14.26]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[134:26.13]Is it?
[134:28.27]What?
[134:28.37]I can get out.
[134:28.77]I can get out of this.
[134:29.41]I can get out of this.
[134:32.15]I'm going to be fine.
[134:32.69]I can get out of this.
[134:39.17]Where is he?
[134:40.65]Where were you?
[134:41.21]Uh, save, um... Uh, do I run?
[134:47.68]Save Brad.
[134:49.30]Save Brad.
[134:56.21]Is that made up?
[135:10.91]That was fake?
[135:13.23]What in God's name is this?
[135:20.86]He was just telling another scary story.
[135:22.48]What?
[135:22.64]I don't understand what just happened.
[135:28.30]So he died.
[135:30.28]Or is he?
[135:31.34]Because he was a ghost before, but then he wasn't.
[135:33.25]And then he was.
[135:34.75]This place is not right.
[135:37.23]What is going on here?
[135:43.99]Free blood.
[135:45.95]Nice, okay.
[135:47.06]How do I drink it?
[135:52.10]I get like a cup or something?

[141:14.69]What are you talking about?
[141:21.77]You guys didn't... Everybody learned how to do that.
[141:24.48]Am I too old for that?
[141:25.34]You guys might be too young.
[141:27.42]Every single person learned how to do the...
[141:34.16]because that was, like, the most popular song in the world.

[142:47.64]Take the skull!
[142:51.66]What are you doing?
[142:59.43]Get the skull!
[143:11.73]Alright, apparently I can't pick up the skull, which I know I needed.
[143:21.51]Blood coming from the ceiling.
[143:22.60]Uh-oh.
[143:32.88]Well, just remember that there's a skull in there.
[143:44.85]Outside the boat Guys jump over And what was I supposed to see something what was I supposed to see I
[144:18.55]Wait, this is... This is the same room.
[144:27.63]So give me the skull.
[144:31.96]This is the box in the beginning of the game.
[144:42.28]Where's the gold?
[144:47.48]Oh, so it's a gold.
[144:49.00]There's gold in there.
[144:53.72]Gold bars, gold coins.
[144:56.05]And the government was trying to keep it and... It's a conspiracy.
[145:00.09]Okay.
[145:05.43]This is the water coming down.
[145:07.25]Interesting.
[145:07.87]Cool.
[145:13.42]Cool.
[145:15.73]Should I not be standing in this, like, gas?
[145:22.32]Did I go back in time?
[145:24.77]Where's Brad?
[145:47.46]It's the same book, right?
[145:48.34]Okay, this is the Satan book.
[145:54.02]Standard operating procedure for handling hazardous chemicals.
[145:57.42]Department for... It sure is.
[146:05.77]Avoid storing chemicals.
[146:07.89]Leaks the wire rope clean and stored in any chemicals.
[146:10.79]Make certain that... What?
[146:13.83]What?
[146:18.23]Its color band is, make certain that blah blah blah is properly marked before its color band is visible so the cargo can be identified quickly.
[146:27.22]Refer to paragraph 26B.
[146:29.84]The cargo must be secured to avoid movement during passage.
[146:33.14]Pass the stowage with fresh water.
[146:38.18]Grease to drums help protect them.

[146:56.89]Why am I reading this shit?
[146:58.25]I don't know.
[146:59.13]It might be important.
[147:03.17]Is it not important?
[147:06.13]Why would I read this shit?
[147:08.98]I feel like this is important stuff.
[147:14.90]Does it look important?
[147:18.14]No?
[147:18.32]What do you mean, does it look important?
[147:26.48]It's a hazardous chemical removal.
[147:28.66]Yes, it is very important.
[147:40.49]No.
[147:48.26]Another dead person.
[147:55.02]Wait, this is, wait, wait, this is where Charlie was!
[147:56.80]Uh oh.
[148:06.91]Now we're... What?
[148:11.59]There's the guy with the hat on.
[148:19.82]Oh, there's Brad.
[148:22.04]Hey, are you Brad?
[148:23.56]Just like, I need to know.
[148:26.90]Brad.
[148:27.56]Are you Brad?
[148:28.04]Am I allowed to tell you this information?
[148:29.46]Can I, what?
[148:32.82]Are you trying to fist bump me right now?
[148:34.29]Mute, mute, mute, mute, mute, mute.
[148:39.01]Hey, what's wrong?
[148:42.45]What the fuck?
[148:44.71]Did I make this in the movies?
[149:07.85]Wait, did I... I spoiled it?
[149:09.77]Wait, what?
[149:27.85]Hey, are you Brad?
[149:35.20]Well, he asked me earlier if I was Brad.
[149:37.66]I was confirming the same thing with him.
[149:50.85]We both spoiled each other's game?
[149:52.75]No, we didn't.
[150:00.05]W doesn't exist!
[150:01.15]What the fuck?!
[150:03.17]I am so mad right now.
[150:04.59]I think I killed him.
[150:12.36]What is happening?!
[150:13.22]I can't move the controller!
[150:27.27]It's switching from keyboard to fucking controller.
[150:31.18]on a whim, when it decides to.
[150:33.22]Alright.
[151:02.74]Come on.
[151:31.72]That guy saved you.
[151:40.92]He tried to kill me.
[151:41.80]I did.
[151:43.39]No I didn't, he's fine.
[152:21.48]Now I'm back here.
[152:22.90]Okay.
[152:44.81]Hey, are you Brad?
[152:45.81]Brad's in front of me right now.
[152:47.37]Listen, I don't know anything that's happening.
[152:50.74]I'm just kidding.
[152:51.46]I'm kidding.
[152:53.52]I have no clue what's going on.
[152:56.54]Not in like the good way either.
[152:59.56]Like literally just... I had a fucking keyboard.
[153:02.59]Alright, I gotta mute.
[153:05.69]Wait, no, that's you.
[153:06.37]That's you.
[153:06.73]That is you.
[153:09.69]No, that's not you.
[153:10.73]Are you Brad?
[153:13.69]Stop asking that!
[153:15.09]Alright, you have to sit on board!
[153:20.34]Alright, I'm understanding what's happening in this game.
[153:38.46]So, we're not supposed to be working together.
[153:43.21]Us doing this in co-op, it was like a bad idea.
[153:47.42]We were supposed to just like be playing together, like, hey, what do you find?
[153:50.36]What'd you find over there?
[154:03.41]A Wii, Brad?
[154:10.27]No, I realized that like 20 minutes ago.
[154:12.11]I realized that after the... He asked me if I was Brad.
[154:21.56]And I'm like, what are you talking about?
[154:23.32]And then I had... And then he was Brad.
[154:25.20]You know what I mean?
[154:26.54]That was a cycle that we were in.
[154:32.15]And yes, I know that hitting the key is changing it to keyboard.
[154:37.67]I know.
[154:51.18]Guys, I knew that after the first 200 people said it.
[154:55.26]Really?
[154:55.54]Why is this taking me so long?
[155:13.86]I just can't open this thing by myself.
[155:21.15]Alex has found a secret.
[155:23.85]See, we went into this thinking it was gonna be like, oh, it's like a co-op horror experience.
[155:28.31]No, we're actively playing, like, against each other, and we just don't even know.
[155:37.61]Mad because Brad.
[155:46.79]Because we, like, aren't supposed to be sharing information with each other, then.
[155:52.09]You know what I mean?
[155:52.59]It's gonna be Lofstrom here, I hope.
[156:20.04]Yeah, we're like hallucinating.
[156:22.83]The monster and somebody... Oh, no, you're a... The monster, you just strangled that guy.
[156:27.49]You killed... That's not Brad.
[156:29.34]That's me.
[156:30.84]That's not a monster.
[156:31.66]It's me.
[156:38.02]There has to be a key around here somewhere.
[156:44.76]Just like it was in the beginning of the game.
[156:45.86]Oh, what's that have?
[156:55.72]Ah, hello.
[156:58.58]Do you open the safe?
[157:06.79]Mad because Brad.
[157:17.59]Can't go that way.
[157:21.39]That's fucking funny.
[157:24.27]That's a good one.
[157:26.23]Alright, let's use the key in the safe.
[157:40.33]Alright, what does it say?
[157:46.36]What does it say?
[157:47.52]Read it!
[157:47.82]No, read the letter!
[157:51.60]I thought safes don't use keys.
[157:54.58]They don't...
[157:56.55]I mean, maybe back in like the fucking 20s.
[158:02.73]Summary of Manchurian gold.
[158:04.65]Study of response of human beings to ingesting chemical designated Manchurian gold.
[158:10.84]Okay.
[158:12.50]Chemical ingested in crystal dust formed by subjects A, B, C, D, and E. All volunteers provided by base sergeant.
[158:22.00]Right.
[158:24.74]Test successful.
[158:25.56]Results consistent with biological specimen test reports in supplied files.
[158:31.27]Full report forthcoming.
[158:32.29]Further studies.
[158:32.93]Strong lyric metaphor.
[158:33.71]Stimulus response.
[158:35.09]Relationship in subjects under influence of chemical.
[158:38.23]Please note, latest test results do not supersede... So the Manchurian gold is just a bunch of unstable chemicals.
[158:45.09]Mm-hmm.
[158:46.75]Okay.
[158:47.45]High caution must be taken to avoid exposure of chemicals to solution, extreme heat, and electricity.
[158:53.29]There's five subjects.
[158:56.45]Right.
[158:57.25]Okay.
[159:02.95]Alright, where else do I go?
[159:09.43]Can I go in any of these other doors?
[159:21.50]Pause the game.
[159:21.98]I gotta fill my water bottle.
[159:26.14]Oh god.
[159:26.32]He- this is a tally.
[159:54.78]Should I unmute and say, are you Brad?
[159:57.68]Like, I keep running into Brad.
[160:15.03]No, but he, okay, but he doesn't know.
[160:18.15]So he's gonna, like, kill me.
[160:21.61]What's going on with that light?
[160:24.51]I almost just missed the QTE because of that.
[160:36.25]I'm just chasing him down.
[160:37.49]Conrad!
[160:53.02]See, I know what's happening.
[161:06.97]So I'm reading this thing here.
[161:08.83]It says that this... There's like a pentagram on it and shit.
[161:13.17]I'm reading it for like 40 minutes.
[161:15.23]It seems like pretty important.
[161:18.43]Yeah, it's weird because in my game...
[161:21.92]What have you been doing?
[161:24.02]I've been, like, really just bored reading material.
[161:26.77]Well, see, me and the other character are playing checkers.
[161:30.53]Whoever loses has to cook dinner tonight.
[161:33.09]Oh, that's weird.
[161:36.97]Alright, I'm gonna get back to reading, I guess.
[161:40.82]Yeah, no, there's a lot of books in the game.
[161:42.70]There are too many books.
[161:43.86]It's, like, kind of ridiculous.
[161:47.06]But it's all good.
[161:50.04]This one here...
[161:55.05]This is too long.
[161:56.65]I'm just gonna leave this room, guys.
[161:58.33]It's like way too long.
[161:59.29]I guess I'll try to play the piano again.
[162:17.52]I almost missed that.
[162:40.12]Should I stop, like... It's weird, like, I'm at the buffet.
[162:42.64]Yeah, there's a bunch of, like, just elderly cruise liner type buffet people here just clamoring for the free cheeseburger line.
[162:53.37]This game's fucking boring, then.
[162:55.29]Because I'm literally just walking around the same room.
[162:59.65]Just playing the fucking piano.
[163:01.39]It's, like, terrible.
[163:04.74]Stop!
[163:05.06]Get away from the edge!
[163:06.66]I didn't think it was this boring.
[163:12.06]Is that somebody in the window?
[163:13.96]You got somebody in the window?
[163:14.90]What the fuck?
[163:17.97]There's a face in the window here.
[163:21.85]Come on.
[163:26.91]Come on, please.
[163:29.72]It's me.
[163:30.48]Look at me.
[163:32.98]It's Bliss.
[163:33.96]See?
[163:34.32]It's Bliss.
[163:36.16]What are you doing up here?
[163:42.04]Goddamn, you scared the hell out of me.
[163:47.42]Come on, we should keep moving.
[163:49.06]Fresh air, yeah, that's right.
[163:52.57]Oh, fuck.
[163:56.97]Uh, I'm still in the... Wait, what the fuck was that?
[164:01.81]I've been doing a loading screen for like five minutes.
[164:04.04]What the fuck is that?
[164:06.40]Oh, it's Brad.
[164:06.88]Are you Brad?
[164:07.28]Are you controlling Brad?
[164:08.00]He's in the piano room with me now.
[164:10.20]Um, actually, I found out if you just don't play the game for about five minutes, the AI takes over.
[164:16.35]Fuck.
[164:18.19]Alright, it's us.
[164:19.37]This is us.
[164:20.31]Get ready.
[164:32.19]Am I Alex or are you Alex?
[164:33.96]Who was it?
[164:34.72]Uh, I am Julia.
[164:37.18]Okay, so I'm Alex.
[164:40.29]Imagine needing to look at your feet to walk up the stairs.
[164:43.01]Like, imagine needing to look at your hands when you'd punch the keys on the keyboard.
[164:52.36]I can barely hear you over this.
[164:58.13]That's what I did too.
[164:58.75]That's what I did too.
[165:13.90]I don't know if you're actually Alex or... Oh, you are.
[165:16.94]Okay.
[165:17.72]You're deciding.
[165:19.02]Yeah, we're going.
[165:30.17]Comrade.
[165:33.01]Help me.
[165:35.27]Close it.
[165:35.73]Lock it.
[165:40.01]Nice work.
[165:41.13]Nice job.
[165:46.38]Are you Brad?
[165:48.16]I don't know who I am now.
[165:49.43]Am I Brad?
[165:49.93]Are you Brad?
[165:50.77]You have to be.
[165:51.25]There's so many people.
[166:02.11]Who's Brad?
[166:05.15]Oh, we're playing in five-player mode the whole time.
[166:12.20]We've only been controlling one character each.
[166:14.18]So we're all, everyone's still alive.
[166:16.00]We did a phenomenal fucking job.
[166:18.60]Chad is back.
[166:21.42]We're good, I think.
[166:27.96]So by the way.
[166:28.74]We did it.
[166:29.12]There was a period of about five minutes that I was not here during the last chapter.
[166:35.52]What do you mean not here?
[166:36.48]You were actually gone.
[166:37.76]Yeah.
[166:39.14]Things appear to have taken a turn towards the spiritual, wouldn't you say?
[166:44.11]Have you figured out what's going on?
[166:47.97]How to stop it?
[166:48.39]How to save the lives of your poor, unfortunate stowaways?
[167:05.15]You will, I hope.
[167:06.87]They said four?
[167:07.79]Although it seems the ship's previous occupants never managed to.
[167:12.65]Quite a lot of deaths that night.
[167:17.47]Let me help you out.
[167:18.90]Give you a little hint.
[167:20.00]Need a Brad flowchart.
[167:24.06]No, I don't... No spoilers.
[167:25.82]Get out of here.
[167:27.82]No hint?
[167:30.00]Perhaps you think you can piece things together from the clues you found yourself.
[167:34.85]Good luck with that.
[167:38.61]Perhaps you've started to realize something.
[167:41.86]This is just the guy that binge-watched the whole season before you've had time to sit down and watch.
[167:46.92]He's dying.
[167:48.50]Talk about what he thinks.
[167:51.34]Whoa!
[167:51.98]Welcome to Pellenteller, Fool Us!
[167:53.65]That fooled us!
[167:55.31]Well, I'm so excited to find out what your poor unfortunates are making of all this, and how you might avoid any more unnecessary tragedy.
[168:04.55]Go on, back to it.
[168:07.09]Speak soon.
[168:12.79]Oh, Hand of Fate 3.
[168:15.71]That'd be fun.
[168:17.83]Okay, we know who we are.
[168:20.89]What the hell is wrong with you back there?
[168:22.03]Do we though?
[168:22.39]I have to pee.
[168:23.79]Brad, you lost your shit!
[168:25.17]I did too, that's why I was gone.
[168:26.95]What?
[168:27.11]What are you talking about?
[168:28.01]Come on, no.
[168:28.95]No, come on, that's ridiculous.
[168:32.49]That was a pretty good Jay Leno impression.
[168:34.11]This is all your fault by the way.
[168:52.58]It might be.
[168:52.92]If you don't ever split up, nothing bad can happen.
[168:55.74]Hey, whoa, whoa!
[169:20.75]My face?
[169:21.05]That's rude.
[169:21.51]No, I'm Alex.
[169:22.57]Chemicals.
[169:24.29]You're breathing them in.
[169:44.73]It's a ghost ship.
[169:45.97]Wow, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.
[169:47.87]I'm going to turn the water on.
[170:07.19]Mystery box?
[170:07.97]JJ?
[170:08.13]Is this a ghost ship?
[170:09.76]I mean, I guess.
[170:30.27]Am I crazy, or are we on a ghost ship?
[170:32.47]Like, ghost ships are real, and this is one, and we're totally on it, and holy shit, we're so totally fucked?
[170:38.82]I was gonna say the same thing.
[170:39.92]Pretty quick tonal change there.
[170:41.14]According to this letter I found, the guards here were absolutely terrified of something on the ship.
[170:45.04]I agree with everything you say, honey.
[170:46.46]We found a note that said a bunch of guys tried to get out of guard duty because they were really freaked out by something.
[170:56.14]This place is weird.
[170:57.16]There's some unnatural shit going on here.
[170:59.84]It is unsuper-freaking-natural.
[171:02.26]Everything about this place is wrong.
[171:04.22]We know more than we did before.
[171:06.60]That's something, at least.
[171:08.00]We're wasting time.
[171:09.48]Whatever we do, we have to do it now.
[171:11.72]Time to get off this ship.
[171:13.42]We're not going anywhere without the distributor cap.
[171:16.00]The Duke needs it to run.
[171:17.10]Nope.
[171:18.14]Hold on.
[171:18.62]We can leave it.
[171:19.78]This ship's gotta have a radio.
[171:21.78]Time for the radio quest.
[171:22.83]If we can find it and use it...
[171:25.44]That's great, but do you think it still works?
[171:27.94]Just need to find a way up there.
[171:29.70]Time for the radio fetch quest.
[171:36.87]Alright.
[171:39.73]We got the whole party here.
[171:46.65]Uh, okay.
[171:47.97]I'm Alex.
[171:49.11]We gotta get Alex's damn shit.
[171:51.67]It's a classic problem.
[171:54.91]Who am I?
[171:57.27]You're Alex.
[171:57.95]Okay.
[171:58.35]Yeah, I am Alex.
[171:59.31]Okay, you were just Alex.
[172:00.61]I walked into a corner, but I thought you were walking into a corner.
[172:03.44]This is why I was confused.
[172:05.22]Because you were Alex 15 seconds ago, and then it just gave me control over Alex.
[172:10.56]Yeah, I've been told in local mode, you get to pick who you want to be.
[172:14.52]It's weird that you don't just pick who you want to be.
[172:16.99]Yeah, why can't we just choose?
[172:23.35]Cigar?
[172:26.33]I know it sounds crazy, but maybe it was these guns that took down the plane from our dive.
[172:33.43]I guess I'm just standing over your shoulder.
[172:35.03]Am I handing this to you?
[172:39.13]Here.
[172:39.49]Did you just pass the lore baton to me?
[172:46.22]Here, you look at this.
[172:47.70]You put this back.
[172:48.40]I'm done with this.
[172:48.88]I didn't even say anything.
[172:51.75]Not even one line of dialogue.
[172:53.45]Just I set it back down for you.
[172:55.23]Yeah, you put this away.
[172:57.75]Honey, I left my play chat again for dinner.
[172:59.53]Thank you.
[173:02.01]Can you clean them up now?
[173:07.46]We could use this boat.
[173:12.90]Great.
[173:14.10]Do I have to come confirm?
[173:18.84]It's got holes in it.
[173:19.72]Let's go get some duct tape.
[173:29.65]You can put duct tape on it.
[173:31.89]All the characters are together.
[173:33.25]Seems like they should exchange everything that they've learned so far.
[173:38.19]We're silently just walking around.
[173:40.37]Sadly, no, but I'll keep my eyes open.
[173:45.51]It just feels like really empty in these parts.
[173:47.82]Where it's just... There's five people.
[173:51.34]And we're all just... NPC walking around.
[173:59.91]Like, yeah, it's some... Just some dialogue or some back and forth or something.
[174:04.71]Just to... What is that?
[174:06.91]Hey!
[174:13.42]Hey!
[174:14.91]Oh yeah, we're actually playing spy party now, aren't we?
[174:18.51]Okay, I was gonna say, if there's a QTE available, fail it.
[174:42.90]See, there he goes.
[174:44.04]That's like a standard NPC walk up the stairs.
[174:57.76]My turn.
[175:09.22]These are the heaviest characters, too.
[175:11.97]Yeah, they do feel like they're, they're waiting like, full of concrete, like their shoes have concrete.
[175:15.99]Alright, don't waste your time looking, nope, don't go this way.
[175:18.77]Just go the other way.
[175:19.55]Because there's nothing there.
[175:22.22]We're just all walking around with our mouths open.
[175:28.64]Oh, found it.
[175:30.80]This is where I chased Conrad.
[175:32.04]So that, yeah, that was me, being chased.
[175:41.04]Oh.
[175:42.12]That was you being chased by Conrad.
[175:44.94]No.
[175:48.28]I was being chased as Conrad.
[175:52.66]Wow.
[175:56.82]Wow.
[176:03.14]No wonder they have such a hard time.
[176:04.34]Here we go.
[176:05.74]We gotta do the five person push through the door.
[176:12.09]Aww.
[176:18.36]Jesus!
[176:25.63]Maybe they didn't write the dialogue because half the people that play this game lose a character by this point.
[176:30.07]So they just didn't.
[176:31.19]Oh shit, that's right.
[176:32.99]That's true.
[176:34.55]Now it makes sense.
[176:35.33]They just didn't.
[176:36.43]Because they might not even be here.
[176:38.78]Someone's supposed to be dead by now, so let's not even write them lines.
[176:42.54]That's true.
[176:43.16]I didn't even think about that.
[176:45.74]They really are just ghost NPCs because they're not supposed to even be here potentially.
[176:52.36]Wow.
[176:54.10]Game development.
[176:54.76]Wow.
[176:56.17]interesting stuff I really shouldn't be laughing at that but also can I get out of here how do we leave this room it was funny what was in here find a radio yet
[177:26.61]No, but there's got to be a radio on this ship.
[177:28.73]There has to be.
[177:30.05]Yeah, that makes sense.
[177:31.25]Just put Julia here.
[177:34.38]She sits there.
[177:35.30]She's just completely out of the way.
[177:36.52]She has no reactions.
[177:38.98]She's not supposed to be here.
[177:43.96]Oh, I found another book.
[177:53.45]Hold on.
[177:53.73]Painting.
[177:55.29]I got Bering updated.
[177:58.93]The world.
[178:00.33]Secret found.
[178:02.65]China to America.
[178:06.67]And then we got another.
[178:08.91]This is the boat that the beginning of the game started with.
[178:13.71]So it was coming from China.
[178:19.53]China to America.
[178:20.29]And then it goes.
[178:20.97]And then the red gets stuck over here.
[178:23.36]That's where we are.
[178:33.26]What is this?
[178:36.76]Are we already separated?
[178:38.16]Yes, I think so.
[178:39.86]Technically.
[178:41.09]We're just walking around.
[178:42.59]What does this say?
[178:50.59]Ship was blown off course.
[178:52.49]Cloud cover was bad.
[178:53.59]Yeah, she is just sitting there, huh?
[178:54.81]They couldn't establish a position.
[178:56.77]Storm.
[178:58.13]It says lightning strikes.
[179:02.37]Search for crew member overboard.
[179:03.80]Search called off.
[179:05.09]No com.
[179:05.89]Is this us?
[179:08.80]Funny streamer, make me laugh.
[179:11.56]Alright, fine.
[179:13.74]I was just reading it.
[179:17.32]Like you were asking me to do that?
[179:19.74]Hey, funny streamer, I have your stream open while I play co-op.
[179:22.54]I'm watching your stream right now.
[179:23.98]Do something funny.
[179:25.24]No freaking way.
[179:27.46]This thing actually still works?
[179:29.30]Well, radio science hasn't changed much in seven years.
[179:32.78]As long as there's power.
[179:34.28]I'll give it a whirl.
[179:36.40]How are we still getting power?
[179:39.59]Ghost power.
[179:40.30]Ghost energy.
[179:43.16]You have to go very far.
[179:46.84]Storm Thursday.
[179:49.92]East pressure.
[179:50.60]Oh, I skipped it.
[179:59.27]You skipped it.
[180:01.53]How do you skip it?
[180:02.23]You skipped the cutscene?
[180:06.45]It Luigi'd me, don't worry.
[180:18.88]Oh, you're the one doing this.
[180:22.78]I see.
[180:23.84]I thought this was just an uninteractive cutscene.
[180:25.15]How do you know all that?
[180:25.89]Wouldn't the captain know that better?
[180:27.71]Yeah.
[180:40.49]Please repeat.
[180:41.01]Are you sure you're not reading the back of the Tyson chicken nuggets?
[180:46.74]This is an emergency.
[180:47.90]Please help.
[180:50.30]Hello?
[180:51.18]Hello?
[180:51.84]You gotta let your finger off the button for them to talk back.
[180:58.73]150 degrees for 20 minutes.
[181:01.87]Roger.
[181:04.53]Yo, guys.
[181:05.85]They heard it was an emergency, so they're like...
[181:10.25]They're going to come and be new pirates.
[181:12.95]You invited the new antagonist to come find us.
[181:17.28]Why did I panic?
[181:18.60]Because I tried the calm approach and they didn't listen to me.
[181:22.78]So then I decided to scream.
[181:23.52]It's going to be like a second gang of pirates.
[181:25.44]Why?
[181:25.56]What's wrong with him?
[181:26.24]He got punched in the face like three hours ago.
[181:39.83]Sounds like you're scared of someone stepping out of your shadow.
[181:41.83]Scared of my idiot brother getting himself killed?
[181:43.95]How about showing me some brotherly love?
[181:49.92]All right.
[181:50.34]Hey, if you're sure you're up for it, I believe you got it, bro.
[181:54.48]I'm coming too.
[181:55.34]Hey, wait.
[181:56.06]No, don't send him.
[181:57.06]You're not my bodyguard.
[181:58.32]I can take care of myself.
[181:59.40]Oh, no.
[182:09.40]Whoa, whoa.
[182:10.70]If Julia says she can handle it, she can handle it.
[182:15.17]Case closed.
[182:15.77]Okay, Julia?
[182:19.09]Wait.
[182:21.23]That team's dead.
[182:26.08]I told you.
[182:26.82]I can't.
[182:41.79]It's like Star Wars, like, trash compactor.
[182:44.73]Shoot.
[182:45.91]That's so fucking funny.
[182:48.56]Immediately, the two potential worst people do this.
[182:51.78]The two weaklings.
[182:54.66]We're like, can I go, please, mommy?
[182:56.34]Yeah, sure.
[182:57.34]If you think you can handle it.
[183:00.12]We're okay.
[183:00.82]Immediately.
[183:01.55]Regret.
[183:07.60]It's going to be a miracle if we can actually have everybody live.
[183:15.55]Oh, I didn't realize that I have to be these two.
[183:18.15]Dude, this is just the broken clock is right twice a day.
[183:21.87]Somehow we end up saving all five.
[183:25.27]It ain't over yet.
[183:26.73]There's going to be a spectacular death parade at the end.
[183:34.71]With clowns.
[183:38.16]After you.
[183:40.88]Okay, here we go.
[183:41.42]Wait, is this us?
[183:43.16]Uh, yeah.
[183:44.52]I'm Brad.
[183:45.58]Are you... Hey, am I, though?
[183:47.24]Could... Might not be.
[183:51.03]Guessing these are the lower levels of the ship.
[183:52.77]No, I'm just fucking around.
[183:54.05]I'm actually upstairs.
[183:54.71]No, you're not.
[183:57.55]Yes, I am.
[183:58.57]Don't lie to me.
[184:02.95]I'm upstairs.
[184:03.43]We're trying to get the radio to work again.
[184:13.33]The frequencies are so stupid.
[184:29.13]We should probably mute, yeah?
[184:38.92]I wish I could actually, you know,
[184:42.42]Enjoy this.
[184:42.96]What the hell are you talking about?
[184:44.86]I think, I think he thinks.
[184:46.02]In any other circumstance, you know, this place would be the coolest place to explore, like, like ever.
[184:52.00]I'm gonna say no, not at all.
[184:54.28]Says the girl, wait to dive a wreck.
[184:56.44]Shut up.
[184:57.09]Well, he's muted right now.
[184:58.51]I think he think, he muted first, not me.
[185:04.79]He muted first.
[185:08.87]Someone named Joe was in sickbay.
[185:12.57]I have to be a really, really good NPC here.
[185:43.13]so I guess there was a fight or something dude named charlie ended up in the brig wait is are you are you reverse pranking me right now I'm just curious also are you like reverse pranking me
[186:16.03]Reverse?
[186:17.71]Yes.
[186:18.83]You're up there doing the radio stuff, right?
[186:20.55]Yeah, what are you doing down here?
[186:24.82]Down here?
[186:26.16]There's three different groups.
[186:28.98]Oh, shit.
[186:29.38]I blew it.
[186:30.16]What are you doing down here?
[186:37.88]Oh, shit.
[186:39.46]Oh, I knew from the beginning.
[186:40.72]Oh, he knew.
[186:41.43]He doesn't know.
[186:47.27]Alright, so what the hell are we supposed to be doing here?
[186:51.75]You reverse pranked me.
[186:54.25]What, did you think I was an NPC for a second just because I was holding the light?
[186:57.46]No, I thought that you were pretending to be an NPC too.
[187:01.80]And then I was going to freak out and be like, wait, is he actually down here?
[187:05.26]Pretty good attempt.
[187:07.20]Ten days approved.
[187:07.86]Alright, let's see.
[187:10.25]Engaging with a soldier in a drunken argument.
[187:14.93]Okay.
[187:23.16]Every one of these hallways looks exactly the same.
[187:33.07]The amount of times that I have Warcraft keyboard turned down a hallway is probably like two hours of this game so far.
[187:52.33]Now, where did you go?
[187:58.60]Here, come check this out.
[187:59.78]I just pulled him.
[188:01.72]I got yoinked.
[188:04.00]I just yoinked him.
[188:06.97]Looks like the engine room.
[188:07.93]Good place to find the generator, right?
[188:13.89]Are you Brad?
[188:16.05]The ladder's broken off here.
[188:19.59]Oh, that would hurt so bad.
[188:28.57]That's a back problem for the rest of your life.
[188:29.93]You should have seen what happened to him earlier.
[188:35.85]This is hurting me just watching it.
[188:37.22]He's fallen three times.
[188:38.98]And, uh...
[188:41.00]what's the other thing tonight oh god what's up that it was it was not this shit again did you see it this again hello isn't this just the same this is the same thing you're not it's the same thing follow my thinking here we know this ship was carrying venturi and gold which was actually some kind of dangerous chemical right and there's just like weird fog everywhere
[189:04.36]This is not a 12-hour game.
[189:05.90]This happened twice in the last three hours.
[189:07.78]Yeah.
[189:08.00]And maybe it's fucking us all up, like in the head, you know?
[189:10.82]I mean, I definitely saw some crazy shit that I could have sworn was real, but maybe it wasn't.
[189:16.49]We know the crew were scared shitless of something.
[189:18.67]None of it happened.
[189:20.11]None of it was real.
[189:21.51]It was just a hallucination.
[189:24.55]This couldn't have anything to do with the plane wreck we dived.
[189:28.29]I mean, maybe there was a connection.
[189:31.10]Maybe they made contact.
[189:33.23]It's a theory, I guess.
[189:35.24]Oh, God.
[189:35.98]Good thing we sent the guy with glasses down here or we never would have figured this out.
[189:39.24]I know.
[189:39.52]All right, what does this say?
[189:52.75]Netherlands.
[189:55.15]Diesel engine number 1734, year 1920, type L87CSE.
[189:56.65]Okay, cool.
[190:16.14]I can't believe, we are absolutely encroaching on like the last arc of the game.
[190:21.33]We have to be, right?
[190:21.97]This is only like a four to five hour game, right?
[190:27.05]And they've already figured out, they just talked about the trick.
[190:29.73]There's gotta be a gotcha moment where you thought you had it figured out, but then.
[190:40.18]Hold on.
[190:41.44]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[190:50.35]Should I pull this out?
[190:53.75]I think I just told him.
[190:58.19]I'm trying to find stuff too.
[191:00.61]But over there.
[191:05.63]That's so ridiculous.
[191:07.01]You're over there exploring and whoever just finds the thing first just sucks the person over.
[191:16.20]wow what what do you mean what's the hold up failed the qte so they let me do it I just did it okay let's get back upstairs that's why you had to call me over because you know you're very book smart but when it comes to practically using your hands you need some help I did it and then you stepped in and did it again mom said it's my turn on super nintendo there are things on the ship that are trying to hurt us over
[191:50.92]It's not real.
[191:51.66]Really?
[191:52.22]The Iran Madan?
[191:55.22]Why was there no subtitles there?
[192:04.01]What did he say?
[192:09.36]The Ran Madan?
[192:11.82]The Duran Duran?
[192:12.88]What was the name of the boat?
[192:14.16]What's this called?
[192:14.82]Iran Madan.
[192:26.81]Nope.
[192:27.67]Hey.
[192:27.83]Come on over.
[192:29.29]What is it?
[192:29.67]Hang on.
[192:29.87]No, I'm serious.
[192:33.11]What is it?
[192:33.45]Uh, it's the Ghostbusters proton pack thing to dive with.
[192:36.07]Scuba gear stuff.
[193:01.57]Those guys aren't even real.
[193:04.79]Actually, they have to be, because have we had a shared hallucination yet?
[193:14.39]I don't... Yeah, I don't know.
[193:16.78]Not yet.
[193:17.16]He can't even hear you.
[193:18.98]He's not awake.
[193:31.58]Yeah, but he's hallucinating.
[193:33.85]Oh, he's hallucinating.
[193:49.82]Rip right side, look right into the camera, because he sees us.
[193:52.00]Oh...
[194:00.38]So have we not concluded that the hallucinations are a result of this strange miasmic gas that has been pouring into the boat since we got on it?
[194:07.20]Yeah, that's what it is.
[194:08.34]Oh, oh, oh.
[194:17.62]He can hear heartbeats.
[194:29.43]How do you not turn around?
[194:32.59]Alright, all your Super Mario RPG practice should have prepared you for that.
[194:35.91]Uh-oh, he's gonna get up.
[194:45.57]Don't breathe in the gas!
[194:46.51]Hold your breath!
[194:48.47]Hold your breath.
[194:50.69]Wait, am I... I'm like seeing... That's not there.
[195:02.29]Yeah, here comes hallucination.
[195:03.63]I know.
[195:07.49]No, we don't.
[195:10.95]Are we gonna do a mute scenario?
[195:13.33]Incoming mute?
[195:29.46]What did you pick?
[195:30.44]Nothing.
[195:30.76]It was you.
[195:31.86]That was your pick.
[195:33.94]What did I... What was important about his hand?
[195:41.45]I don't know.
[195:41.83]Did he have something in it?
[195:45.19]We didn't get the cap.
[195:46.05]Did we get the cap?
[195:46.81]No, he has it.
[195:47.21]There's no use hiding, you little foot.
[195:52.96]What's the problem with sharing all that gold?
[195:55.14]There must be plenty of that to go around.
[195:57.48]Is this the same voice actor?
[195:59.50]And we're all in this together, right?
[196:01.48]Maybe they changed to... Did they Dario this guy?
[196:06.11]Again?
[196:09.05]Again.
[196:09.31]The comm meter.
[196:16.32]But I am the captain.
[196:19.50]I am in control.
[196:21.24]And I am the one that says who goes.
[196:25.54]HE SAID THE TITLE OF MY STREAM!
[196:27.20]HE SAID THE TITLE OF MY STREAM!
[196:28.84]I'M SORRY, I FUCKED- I- I- He said the ti- I- I- I did not know that.
[196:34.96]He said the title of my fucking stream.
[196:36.32]That freaked me out, I'm sorry.
[196:37.42]That's the title of my fucking livestream!
[196:45.40]Please tell me we're safe.
[196:55.30]Okay, fine.
[196:56.40]I got so hyped up over that.
[196:57.30]Didn't this guy get drowned earlier?
[197:25.81]What?
[197:29.21]How many pirates are there?
[197:30.33]What do you mean, drown twice?
[197:38.66]I may as well have got up from the seat and, like, spun around walking.
[197:41.32]He said the title!
[197:42.25]My string!
[197:47.17]Please.
[197:47.89]We've got no problem with you.
[197:49.75]We just want to get out of here.
[197:52.11]Please.
[197:53.62]Uh-oh, they're taking my choice away.
[197:56.80]There's the guy.
[197:57.30]There's the guy.
[197:57.90]Did you see him?
[198:23.10]The guy from the bookshelf was in the background.
[198:29.50]Why can't we breathe the mist?
[198:31.41]What does it do?
[198:32.97]He was in the mist.
[198:34.37]Life.
[198:35.85]Bringing things to life that shouldn't be alive.
[198:38.41]It's inside now.
[198:42.09]Inside with us.
[198:43.27]Now.
[198:44.77]Please, just calm down.
[198:46.31]Stop!
[198:47.85]Stop!
[198:50.21]It's in one of us, isn't it?
[198:53.43]Gonna have to tell him, like, he has the flashlight and I have the gun, so we have to trade.
[198:57.61]You're holding a flashlight, man.
[198:58.69]I'm holding the gun.
[198:59.25]Let's trade.
[198:59.67]Well, I guess we're dead.
[199:02.42]Uh-uh.
[199:02.58]Wait.
[199:18.49]Pogrely!
[199:43.71]I know you're all fancy divers, but you expect me to buy that?
[199:47.01]We've been down here for hours.
[199:50.80]That's actually a great argument.
[199:52.14]We're divers.
[199:52.56]You're holding your breath this whole time.
[199:54.54]You're holding your breath right now.
[199:58.06]Oh, God.
[199:59.64]It's in me.
[200:00.56]I got the mist in me, don't I?
[200:01.90]See?
[200:02.32]I freaked him out.
[200:03.66]It's in me, isn't it?
[200:04.42]I freaked him out.
[200:06.66]So I got some bad news for you.
[200:08.18]Bad news?
[200:08.68]I can feel it swirling around in there.
[200:12.48]It's changing me.
[200:15.97]On the inside.
[200:18.45]Wait, what if... Wait, what if that's one of us?
[200:21.13]And what if we breathe the mist and that's one of us?
[200:23.19]No, let him do it.
[200:24.29]What are you talking about?
[200:25.35]Just let him do it.
[200:26.33]I wouldn't even let him do it.
[200:28.37]There is no... No, no.
[200:30.11]I can't see it.
[200:31.27]You're all right, man.
[200:32.17]There's no mist.
[200:33.95]Stop.
[200:35.51]Stop lying.
[200:39.35]You can all see it in me, can't you?
[200:53.54]Where's the flashlight?
[200:54.56]The flashlight was hovering.
[200:56.72]Alright, now the premonition has been fulfilled!
[201:02.14]We're fine.
[201:05.38]I saw him kill himself like an hour ago.
[201:07.08]You did?
[201:08.26]In a premonition.
[201:12.68]Holy shit.
[201:16.84]I honestly don't know if there was another outcome for that, because... He's been dead for centuries.
[201:28.57]Here, we get a gun.
[201:29.91]No, we don't, because this is two people that don't want guns.
[201:33.01]Oh.
[201:33.69]So we threw it back.
[201:35.15]We're still alive.
[201:40.20]Maybe if you sent down the wrong two people, he would have killed them.
[201:43.78]We sent the two least threatening people in the crew.
[201:46.07]I don't know.
[201:50.33]Wait by the radio.
[201:51.57]Why?
[201:52.47]I'm going to check the next level.
[201:53.73]There might be some more gear down there we can use.
[201:56.85]I'm not going far.
[201:58.09]Just wait by the radio.
[202:00.37]I'm going to hang back here as well.
[202:03.73]See, I thought they were pulling like a- is- you breathe the mist in and like, was that one of us?
[202:07.81]And like, he was back at the wall with the flashlight.
[202:09.89]Nobody's good.
[202:10.85]Yeah, I don't think we can, because there's no- the only times we've hallucinated, we've been by ourselves.
[202:16.10]Like Alex, right here.
[202:17.68]Dude, why the fuck- So Alex is gonna be hallucinating.
[202:20.20]Why can't people fucking just slowly go down a hole?
[202:24.80]Don't say the name of my stream again.
[202:25.80]He's invisible.
[202:27.26]He's invisible.
[202:29.67]How did he not see that?
[202:31.19]He's like a splinter cell enemy.
[202:38.86]All right.
[202:42.86]Splinter cell.
[202:45.39]Blitz, come here!
[202:48.11]Oh, his left eye is blind.
[202:49.17]He just didn't turn left at all.
[202:51.31]Wouldn't dream it.
[202:57.35]I saw the big guy.
[202:58.83]He had the distributor cap.
[203:00.47]Big guy?
[203:00.93]You've got to go after him.
[203:02.67]Who's in the background?
[203:04.45]The guy that's watching us.
[203:05.45]All right.
[203:10.43]So you're... I am Alex.
[203:12.31]You are Fliss, right?
[203:15.19]I'm down there with Julia.
[203:17.79]So you're... Wait, you're not Fliss.
[203:21.21]Is Fliss the captain?
[203:22.55]Yes.
[203:30.31]Alright, I am breathing mist in my own fucking room here.
[203:33.27]What's happening?
[203:34.07]Who are you?
[203:36.07]I'm breathing mist into my own fucking office.
[203:37.77]You're breathing mist?
[203:38.57]Is the mist coming in through the air conditioning?
[203:47.23]In the office?
[204:08.24]It's vape juice.
[204:09.74]Holy crap.
[204:11.86]Look at that shit.
[204:18.31]Vape juice.
[204:19.69]Uh-oh.
[204:20.55]There he is.
[204:21.17]The sledgehammer boss.
[204:38.33]Oh no.
[204:39.72]Oh my god!
[204:40.54]I was looking at my fucking phone.
[204:42.68]Oh, why was I doing that?
[204:44.10]That was stupid.
[204:46.14]I'm fine.
[204:50.08]Holy fuck.
[204:50.72]I did it again.
[204:51.37]I looked at my phone again.
[204:52.19]Holy shit.
[204:56.93]More mist.
[205:11.43]So when you said that they were transporting drugs earlier, you might have been right.
[205:16.37]Was I right?
[205:16.83]The mist drug.
[205:24.51]That's going to be revealed to be some kind of crazy advanced biochemical warfare that the allies were going to use.
[205:31.68]The mist just came out of it.
[205:33.62]The 1940s American military was going to use these weapons of biochemical war.
[205:53.38]Where'd you... Alright, we have to mute.
[205:58.48]Mute, mute.
[206:06.86]What the fuck?
[206:18.46]Is that me?
[206:38.56]Oh.
[206:40.09]This is the laundry room.
[206:48.96]Mmm, dead guy.
[206:58.29]They will strip you a moment around the plant so it will prove difficult to look for Jones.
[207:02.30]Your primary objective is clear, but your secondary objective is when you reach your destination is to locate Jones and his men and get them back home.
[207:08.74]And we said online.
[207:10.08]You must be vigilant and be very concerned with your personal safety.
[207:14.23]You got another one.
[207:18.77]Okay.
[207:19.69]Only that their last known position was approaching the plant and they were silent.
[207:23.55]The plant is high security.
[207:24.59]They're expecting you.
[207:26.69]Sergeant Jones and five of his platoon have gone missing during a reconnaissance mission at the water purification plant.
[207:31.64]Water purification plant.
[207:35.57]They're putting something in the water.
[207:38.69]The mist was supposed to... The mist is the... I get it.
[207:55.74]think he gets it.
[207:57.18]No, I get it.
[208:07.92]The thing is, where do the talics go?
[208:15.42]Nothing else over here?
[208:20.51]Alright, we can't go back.
[208:21.35]I can't go back that way.
[208:28.42]Explain the whole plot to me.
[208:29.84]Okay.
[208:34.02]What the fuck?
[208:34.76]Who are you?
[208:44.42]No.
[208:48.43]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[208:56.66]Is there another hallway I can go down?
[208:58.24]Yeah, I'm like, how am I lost?
[209:08.41]This is like the only... I can't, like, go...
[209:24.15]Am I in different clothes?
[209:26.47]What the fuck is going on?
[209:29.79]What the hell happened?
[209:46.48]The rats are gonna get me.
[209:53.85]They're not real.
[209:54.73]The rats aren't real.
[209:55.71]Just get out.
[209:56.25]What the fuck is going on?
[210:01.71]Is that italics?
[210:06.30]What?
[210:06.94]Who are you?
[210:10.34]Should I have said that?
[210:12.66]Baby!
[210:24.28]Um... I don't... I can't communicate.
[210:28.85]I can't communicate.
[210:33.17]What did you do to me?
[210:35.83]What did you do to me?
[210:38.11]What the fuck?
[210:41.24]Why did I... Who's doing that?
[210:53.68]Why did that happen to me?
[210:57.17]What?
[210:57.91]Kill the rat!
[211:00.58]Should I?
[211:01.08]No, the rat's not real!
[211:02.60]The rat's not real!
[211:03.30]Don't do that!
[211:18.25]Well, I would have stabbed him and killed him.
[211:20.80]If I had stabbed the monster, I would have killed, like, somebody else.
[211:33.98]Are you Brad?
[211:37.72]I am now.
[211:53.37]You, uh, you hungry?
[211:57.31]I heard some, like, atomic noises.
[212:00.27]Just wondering if you need a snack.
[212:08.04]I didn't want to stab you.
[212:10.28]So I'm like, oh, I'll get the monster in my... Let me see.
[212:14.90]Ducal Milan?
[212:15.73]No engine.
[212:16.89]Guess that's pretty much the end of it.
[212:18.81]Looks like it.
[212:20.23]You couldn't- I could've done nothing?
[212:32.63]Yeah, but whatever, I... I... So you got scared on my screen, you were running away from a rat.
[212:39.99]Yes, and on my screen, the rat busted through my chest.
[212:43.19]And was killing me.
[212:44.35]And I had a choice to stab the monster, which was you, probably, or the rat in my stomach, and I realized, wait, the rat's not real, I just, I killed myself.
[212:54.11]The rat in my stomach.
[212:55.89]I just wanted to be able to tell him, I'm sorry.
[213:03.40]And now I'll never get that chance.
[213:05.98]He's fucking dead!
[213:07.82]Oh, God, Alex.
[213:08.64]I'm so sorry.
[213:11.42]Wait, that's not the end of the game.
[213:12.72]I'm so sorry, Alex.
[213:17.78]You killed the person with arguably the most personal connection to any of these characters.
[213:25.69]Nobody would have cared if Chad died.
[213:27.65]What's his name?
[213:29.89]Drew?
[213:30.29]Wait, hold on.
[213:30.85]That's the end of the game.
[213:37.20]That's not it.
[213:40.33]Conrad.
[213:48.35]That's the end.
[213:51.05]I guess that's the end.
[213:51.99]That's how you make core games nowadays.
[213:55.60]By the way, on my screen, there was a piece of paper that confirmed my theory that it was a military weapon went rogue.
[214:02.62]So literally the next scene.
[214:05.17]That's it.
[214:06.09]Game over.
[214:07.15]You're dumb.
[214:08.31]You're dumb?
[214:08.87]Oh, I thought he said I'm dumb.
[214:11.01]I was supposed to say, fuck you.
[214:16.56]Impressive.
[214:18.18]Almost everyone survived.
[214:20.80]The last fucking QT.
[214:22.26]Oh, god damn it.
[214:23.24]Really?
[214:23.52]And the distributor cap?
[214:27.94]Boom.
[214:28.18]Boom.
[214:30.49]Alright, yeah, apparently I broke that, but it wasn't my fault.
[214:34.85]Well, give me some credit here.
[214:37.83]My game broke, I teleported into a room, and then the cutscene jumped around in three different rooms.
[214:44.00]You gotta give me some credit here.
[214:45.16]That was bullshit.
[214:46.90]I teleported into the laundry room.
[214:50.54]And then, like, my character changed clothes.
[214:52.86]There are always repercussions.
[214:56.21]And then, like, a guy was being eaten by rats, and then I got a knife and I had to stab myself.
[215:01.43]You gotta see what happened to me when you were the monster, because it was, it had to have been more abrupt.
[215:07.42]Till we meet again, maybe in Little Hope, maybe somewhere else.
[215:13.98]But be certain, we will meet again.
[215:17.94]It's inevitable.
[215:25.53]Regardless of how many people survived, that is somehow worse than the Blair Witch ending yesterday.
[215:30.96]Restart and don't break the distributor cap.
[215:34.22]You want us to go through another three hours and 40 minutes?
[215:38.08]How did we... How is this only three and a half hours, by the way?
[215:54.64]We were playing on streamer time, too.
[215:56.38]So wait, so hold on.
[215:57.18]So how did you break the distributor cap?
[215:59.36]I don't know.
[215:59.76]There was a door, and I tried to open it, and then I had to mash A, and I successfully mashed A, then an elevator fell down, and then it broke the distributor cap that was down there.
[216:08.19]I don't know how to even save that.
[216:10.73]I can't skip it.
[216:11.63]All right, you want to go back and try to save everybody?
[216:24.58]With apparently, we can do a scene select.
[216:27.11]Okay, let's do the scene select.
[216:29.82]Hold on.
[216:34.67]Elevator was Jerma's fault.
[216:36.61]How?
[216:37.57]Was it?
[216:38.27]What did I do?
[216:39.07]My character like teleported around and then like I saw something break.
[216:45.19]I don't understand.
[216:47.79]I'm like an innocent bystander for this whole game.
[216:51.61]I don't think I chose one.
[216:53.09]Oh, I did choose not to kill you.
[216:54.54]I think I took too long getting to the elevator to like... I don't know.
[217:04.91]What is this?
[217:05.51]I don't know.
[217:07.11]Is this post credits?
[217:08.49]Yeah.
[217:10.93]They're going to kill everybody.
[217:15.57]To protect the government secrets.
[217:25.20]What happened?
[217:35.68]So that whole thing was for fucking no reason?
[217:39.50]Did I write this game?
[217:42.19]Did I do this?
[217:44.25]So even if all five got in, then it's all five go anyways.
[217:50.71]Unless you protect the cap, apparently.
[217:53.34]Oh.
[217:54.20]You gotta get the cap.
[217:55.12]Did you escape on the boat?
[218:03.16]And then everyone died.
[218:05.28]See, nothing that we did mattered, no.
[218:07.86]Like, you can make it matter.
[218:09.54]I just saw someone in the woods.
[218:11.02]Whoever it was, they're gone.
[218:15.07]I know that guy.
[218:16.65]He's in a bunch of movies.
[218:17.77]Who's there?
[218:41.09]Little hope.
[218:42.89]In 2020?
[218:44.65]That seems like a very long time away for an episode two.
[218:48.69]Well, here's the bad news.
[218:50.84]It's a separate purchase, I think.
[218:52.90]Is it?
[218:53.14]Uh-huh, I think it is.
[218:55.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[218:56.14]Chat can correct me if I'm wrong.
[219:00.48]Wait, hold on.
[219:01.66]Slow down and back that up and just reverse it for a second.
[219:04.64]I'm pretty sure this is a standalone purchase that we just played.
[219:08.19]This is a three-hour and, like, 20-minute experience, essentially.
[219:11.83]Uh-huh.
[219:12.87]Yeah.
[219:13.31]And it's $40.
[219:15.03]And then episode two... How much was it?
[219:16.79]Was it $30 or $40?
[219:17.68]How much was this?
[219:23.06]It wasn't $40, I don't think.
[219:24.22]Was it $30?
[219:24.52]All right, it's $30.
[219:25.48]Okay.
[219:26.80]All right, all right.
[219:27.48]That's not... Apparently, it's $30.
[219:33.41]yeah and and they didn't do the way out where only one person has to buy it to like play with the other person so we both bought it that is technically one ending you can get right so I mean you could you could technically play through this game like a few times right I think this would be worth it if you at least I'm down I'm a zero so wait you get this game is zero no no no like obs is at zero
[220:01.29]Oh.
[220:02.31]But I can still hear you.
[220:03.37]I'm still live.
[220:06.67]Anyway.
[220:10.39]Okay, because that transition was just like, you know, it'll be great.
[220:13.55]I mean, I'm at a zero right now, essentially.
[220:16.52]I don't know why.
[220:18.38]I'm still at zero.
[220:19.82]What?
[220:20.98]Yeah, it must be VPN.
[220:23.08]Maybe it's a VPN.
[220:23.68]It's fucking up.
[220:25.36]Because I'm still fine.
[220:28.12]Maybe it's... Yeah, that's weird.
[220:29.65]You should come back.
[220:30.39]It's very soon here.
[220:32.42]actually not uh cox no not cox this time uh you want to try to do the last part again see what happens yeah I'll give it a try just do that final scene to see if we can do it I'm going to invite you
[221:01.29]Hold on.
[221:02.72]So, like, okay, if you do that... I have some technical difficulties.
[221:06.72]Yeah, do you think?
[221:07.48]I'm just going to hang up for a little bit.
[221:09.64]So, if you play this game alone, what... There goes kind of all the fun.
[221:22.92]Yeah, I mean, whatever fun you have is absolutely not present.
[221:29.01]Because, oh, is it, I mean, once, when we figured it out that it was like, wait a minute, are you Brad?
[221:35.55]Oh, hey, am I Brad?
[221:37.50]Wait, who are you?
[221:38.86]That was like the, oh, that's kind of fun.
[221:41.46]But if you do that by yourself, that, you don't get to ask your friend, are you Brad?
[221:52.73]Huh.
[221:58.40]Mad because Brad.
[222:09.50]$30 for Are You Brad?
[222:16.11]I mean, it seems like there's...
[222:21.07]I wish there was more there.
[222:22.39]It felt like the first... I guess, can people, like, die on the boat?
[222:26.61]I don't know how we didn't lose somebody on the boat.
[222:29.01]How do I stab myself in the stomach at the very last QTE of the game, and no one died during the hostage situation on the boat?
[222:38.48]That makes no sense.
[222:43.50]We, like, dropped the gun, dropped the knife, like, dodged.
[222:46.20]He hit me.
[222:46.92]QTE fail.
[222:47.75]Punched in the face.
[222:48.25]Have you played this game in couch co-op?
[222:50.40]I don't know.
[222:50.72]I think you watch a movie.
[222:54.38]Because wouldn't you know all the information that the other people know?
[222:59.24]I guess.
[223:01.12]So where would the secret be?
[223:03.62]If someone's the monster or not.
[223:05.64]Maybe I guess they just don't control the monster.
[223:09.24]It just cuts part of the scene.
[223:10.86]I wonder.
[223:12.85]Are you green?
[223:14.09]Are you good?
[223:15.27]Yeah.
[223:17.15]I'm back.
[223:17.77]I'm inviting you.
[223:26.68]No screen peeking.
[223:27.53]It is weird that we went through the whole game.
[223:29.81]I mean, I know it was only three and a half hours, but still.
[223:35.41]And one little decision at the very end dictates the entire... Okay, so this is Matters of the Heart Radio Room, right?
[223:46.83]Is the last scene.
[223:49.14]I guess so.
[223:50.10]Would you like to overwrite the current save?
[223:53.25]No reason not to.
[223:54.25]Is it the end?
[223:55.53]No, it's not the end, is it?
[223:56.59]I'm going for it.
[224:05.08]Okay.
[224:06.08]Here we go.
[224:07.02]But anyway, my thought was, if they made it where one person buys it and can invite a friend for free for co-op, then it might be worth $15 per person.
[224:16.00]Maybe.
[224:17.99]Maybe.
[224:20.10]but let's see what happens let's see let's try to get because we had all five people yeah we had everybody was alive um up until the last second yes and then the actual thing is saving the boat okay so we're gonna I'm not gonna stab anything
[224:46.32]And then you had to tap something to save the... All I have to do is open a door.
[224:55.48]Somebody said the elevator was your fault.
[224:57.74]Also.
[224:59.76]I don't know if that's true.
[225:00.66]Alright, here we go.
[225:07.75]So, same thing.
[225:08.51]I'm... You are Fliss.
[225:10.39]I'm Alex.
[225:10.71]Bye.
[225:12.59]Alright, so when I did this last time, I apparently took too long doing this.
[225:18.26]Just go and grab the thing.
[225:57.81]Who stays?
[225:58.87]Who goes?
[225:59.67]Okay.
[226:06.35]He said the name of my stream!
[226:09.11]He said the name of my stream!
[226:13.20]I'm way too excited about this!
[226:14.62]Uh, we just body swapped.
[226:27.80]Really?
[226:28.42]No.
[226:30.16]Alright, so what was the thing?
[226:31.24]What's the thing I'm supposed to grab?
[226:35.77]We gotta get the cap from the big guy.
[226:39.99]And then we separate, and then what was I supposed to get?
[226:42.75]It did just kind of end.
[226:53.36]Just don't activate the elevator.
[226:56.32]Don't activate the elevator.
[227:00.78]Okay, here we go.
[227:01.40]You have to find the guy as fast as you can.
[227:10.30]Okay.
[227:26.70]I'll try.
[227:28.09]I don't think I even have anything I can do.
[227:30.27]I think I just... Holy crap.
[227:34.73]Look at that shit.
[227:35.43]Here we go.
[227:39.71]There he is.
[227:41.74]Alright, he's holding it.
[227:46.86]And then he rees down the hallway.
[227:51.68]And then you have to jump successfully.
[227:54.29]It should be X...
[228:03.00]Okay.
[228:04.72]I'm good.
[228:06.92]There he is.
[228:12.09]Okay.
[228:14.87]Metallics, don't open the door, somebody's saying.
[228:18.27]I'm not gonna open the door.
[228:28.40]Okay, so where am I now?
[228:37.18]He's like just sitting in the corner down here.
[228:39.04]Did that happen last time?
[228:54.35]I don't know.
[228:55.29]I don't remember that.
[228:57.01]Him just dying in the corner?
[228:58.89]No, no.
[228:59.19]I remember that.
[229:00.59]But I can open this door, right?
[229:02.59]They said don't open the elevator door.
[229:04.45]Yeah, I can open this door.
[229:08.29]Okay, now where is he?
[229:15.33]Okay.
[229:15.77]Oh, sorry.
[229:17.35]RB.
[229:19.16]Okay, this scary thing.
[229:20.14]One letter short of BRB.
[229:22.56]Maybe that's why.
[229:23.96]Minus two.
[229:24.94]I took care of it.
[229:25.58]Thank you, chat.
[229:26.28]Oh, okay.
[229:27.88]Then... Now, where is he?
[229:31.30]Is he in this laundry room?
[229:32.60]It was laundry room!
[229:39.83]Okay.
[229:41.52]Let me see it.
[229:42.00]I looked at this.
[229:47.96]Okay.
[229:48.44]Just trying to retrace the steps.
[229:51.12]Alright.
[230:00.83]I didn't even know this was here.
[230:03.42]Okay.
[230:05.38]I found it.
[230:13.59]Alright, I'm about to be in possession.
[230:18.05]I just have to grab?
[230:29.39]I'm gonna get it?
[230:34.43]What the fuck did you do that for?
[230:40.28]Got it.
[230:42.96]Okay, I have the cap.
[230:47.16]Calyx has found a secret.
[230:49.18]Did you just do that?
[230:50.02]I did not.
[230:53.43]It yoinked me into the door.
[230:55.55]I have the cap.
[231:02.15]It doesn't look like you have the cap.
[231:04.95]Looks like you're fighting a rat monster.
[231:06.32]All right, the cap is... We're good.
[231:13.68]That's a sca- I knew it was coming.
[231:15.64]Don't stab anybody!
[231:18.18]Who are you?
[231:19.42]What?
[231:20.98]Who are you?
[231:26.37]Say nothing.
[231:29.03]It took seven.
[231:31.59]Okay.
[231:32.25]I'm afraid.
[231:39.58]Okay.
[231:41.10]No, don't.
[231:44.46]Now don't do anything.
[231:53.08]No, I'm not gonna kill him for the joke.
[231:55.06]I wanna beat the game.
[231:55.96]Okay...
[232:13.77]Oh shit.
[232:17.21]Now what?
[232:23.25]How many times are you gonna try and like... There we are.
[232:30.68]That's five out of five.
[232:39.74]You're not even gonna apologize?
[232:44.71]That's a solid five out of five right there.
[232:47.11]Everyone's safe, everyone's alive.
[232:51.19]Okay, if we get, like, gunned down here again... Oh, they're gonna set off in the boat that they came there in.
[233:17.96]We did it.
[233:20.40]Oh, you did it.
[233:21.36]You saved everybody.
[233:23.79]Did they write any dialogue for this ending?
[233:29.11]Where's Conrad?
[233:31.15]All right.
[233:32.73]Let's try it.
[233:49.31]Conrad's not on the boat.
[233:55.48]There's only four people!
[234:02.86]Everybody got their... the true timeline.
[234:04.61]Everybody got their wish.
[234:10.43]Conrad was just an hallucination from the gas.
[234:13.61]That explains a lot.
[234:15.33]He was kind of a monster.
[234:16.45]That's what this was about.
[234:19.78]venturine gold well that turned out to be quite a bit different than we expected you know I just keep going over it and over it and it doesn't make any sense you know just and I know what I saw well guys I found the paperwork that explains it don't believe in whatever it was that I saw
[234:39.59]It doesn't really, like, explore very much of this, huh?
[234:53.00]Oh, there he is.
[234:56.03]It's kind of like, hey, when you breed this stuff and you become a monster, it's time to go home.
[235:01.61]I feel like this game needed, like, another two full hours to, like, keep that going.
[235:10.93]Well, they kind of did the, you're a monster not really in the prologue, and then there wasn't another thing for the rest of the game.
[235:21.06]That was the joke, trick, gotcha moment in the first 25 minutes, and then they just did it again two more times.
[235:30.90]I guess, let's see our critique from our professor here.
[235:41.09]Rewinding to fix the story.
[235:43.85]Pathetic.
[235:48.92]Congratulations.
[235:51.20]All your charges are still breathing.
[235:53.22]And that's something.
[235:54.64]I suppose.
[235:59.08]Things became a little intense, but Alex kept his nerve.
[236:03.11]Well done, Alex.
[236:04.35]Well done, you.
[236:07.24]It's all about decisions, isn't it?
[236:09.70]Decisions made in a hurry, in a panic, made with the heart instead of the head, or vice versa.
[236:17.32]Sometimes those decisions take a long time to have repercussions.
[236:22.96]But there are repercussions.
[236:25.89]There are always repercussions.
[236:39.03]Streamer, watch out.
[236:39.79]This dude's British.
[236:40.57]Until we meet again.
[236:42.25]Maybe in Little Hope.
[236:43.79]Maybe somewhere else.
[236:47.02]But be certain.
[236:48.78]We will meet again.
[236:51.00]It's inevitable.
[236:53.26]Alright, apparently we need to watch the... I thought you just started singing.
[237:04.18]I was like, holy shit.
[237:06.06]Okay, I'm gonna...
[237:09.78]won't you spare me over till another year won't you spare me over till another year oh shower please all right we're supposed to watch after the credits did you skip the credits they're gonna just shoot us when we get to the beach
[237:46.93]Everybody lived.
[237:47.43]Oh, no!
[237:58.40]Is Danny gonna come out here?
[238:04.86]Oh, Danny, no!
[238:07.16]Danny!
[238:08.72]Oh, they saved us.
[238:11.24]Danny was alive!
[238:16.87]Aren't they just gonna... Do they have gas masks on?
[238:19.44]Or just like... So out of nowhere, this thing just sent out an SOS.
[238:24.18]Guess we got a real life ghost ship here.
[238:31.45]What?
[238:32.05]What?
[238:33.35]Rowdy, pause the game.
[238:34.59]Please reconnect your controller.
[238:36.15]What the fuck are you talking about?
[238:45.78]Trying to ruin the perfect ending at the last second again, I see.
[238:48.50]Dude, Danny was dead, and he wakes up to die again at the end credits if you don't save him.
[239:02.65]That is so hilariously stupid.
[239:09.36]There's a lock on one of these.
[239:10.62]I don't know if you were there with me.
[239:13.88]When I investigated this room...
[239:23.20]But yeah, why don't they don't have a gun?
[239:26.54]What the fuck?!
[239:27.54]Okay, they've got expertise hatched.
[239:30.18]Uh, never mind.
[239:30.88]Danny is... He breathed the mist.
[239:39.88]I just saw someone in the woods.
[239:42.12]Whoever it was, they're gone.
[239:45.32]And just like every other, like, HBO show you watch, here's the trailer for the big thing they got coming out next month.
[240:03.84]Why are we watching this?
[240:05.72]Unskippable, by the way.
[240:07.52]It is unskippable.
[240:08.58]All right, we did it.
[240:23.05]We did do it.
[240:23.67]And that's not coming out till 2020.
[240:27.82]I mean, there's only three months till 2020, but yes.
[240:30.54]That seems like a long time, though, to have anybody, like, continue.
[240:33.68]Oh, yeah, the Dark Pictures Anthology.
[240:37.82]To be clear, the same as $30.
[240:40.70]Not $40, but... You know?
[240:45.78]I'm not sure I agree with the see you in four months mentality.
[240:50.89]I'm just saying that for twice as much money, probably less now that there's sales, you could buy full price Detroit Become Human.
[241:04.70]Yeah, I can't say.
[241:06.14]I mean, it was funny.
[241:09.36]There was some stuff that was interesting.
[241:12.27]But I almost wish that they didn't do this whole, let's make like eight of these little games and just make one good one or two good.
[241:20.41]Why not do three?
[241:22.84]Why eight?
[241:24.24]Why not do three of these or two of these?
[241:27.20]Why does it have to be that many?
[241:35.89]Because...
[241:37.54]I don't know.
[241:37.94]It's... Even four.
[241:39.18]Cut it in half.
[241:39.88]Like, you just spend a little more time on each one.
[241:42.27]Eight's a lot.
[241:42.87]Yeah.
[241:43.49]Eight's a lot.
[241:44.05]Is that... Do they really want to do eight of these?
[241:49.13]Is that for real?
[241:51.75]But are they all $30 each?
[241:54.31]I don't know.
[241:57.49]That's like the most expensive DLC.
[242:01.11]If they want to tell their stories, let them.
[242:03.88]Yeah, but we're the ones buying them.
[242:12.42]I guess we don't have to.
[242:13.38]I'm not on a subway sitting next to a guy telling a scary story.
[242:22.15]I think if you plan for 8, you have to be extremely confident about how many sales you're going to get.
[242:27.25]And I don't know if... Because Man of Medan seems to be kind of universally not anybody's favorite game.
[242:36.28]So...
[242:37.80]people will be willing to try the second time and if both the first two aren't up to par then how are they going to make eight well no one's going to buy three four five six I mean here's like a 500 iq play just wait like seven years for them all to go on like a steam sale just wait for the the dark pictures anthology like eight game series to be like 11 in like 2028
[243:12.76]That's normal IQ.
[243:13.62]That's pretty smart.
[243:14.58]I like the idea.
[243:15.00]I would say the most fun part of the game was that middle section when you were coming to get me.
[243:29.17]And I thought you were the bad guy in that middle section.
[243:32.03]I think after that point, there was nothing left to tell.
[243:36.03]Once we figured that out, then it was kind of like, wait, oh.
[243:41.24]And then the kid runs across the screen two more times.
[243:46.20]And then we just knew.
[243:46.90]Even if we didn't talk about that.
[243:48.99]People said you ruined it, but you didn't ruin it.
[243:50.79]When you said...
[243:55.71]Hey, are you Brad?
[243:56.63]Here's what I really thought.
[243:57.63]Because what you didn't know is I took a five minute BRB because I'd take the dog outside.
[244:02.46]And I just thought it would be funny because there was a guy on the ground with a bullet in his chest and I thought he was cursed.
[244:08.64]And I thought if I touched him that I would like wake him up and he'd become a zombie.
[244:12.39]So I was just like, I'm just going to BRB here.
[244:14.95]And the second that I came back, you yoinked me into the next scene.
[244:21.57]And that's when I was just getting chased by you.
[244:25.83]So when you said, are you Brad?
[244:27.03]What I thought was not that you were a good guy that I shouldn't kill, but I thought you had taken over control as the ghost of the ship.
[244:34.57]And you were going to, it was going to, I thought they were going to do like a, like a way out thing where we're actually adversarial for like the rest of the game.
[244:42.00]Unfortunately, unfortunately you didn't get my texts.
[244:47.10]That's the one unfortunate part about this whole stream.
[244:50.53]Because I wanted to change rooms.
[244:55.75]I wanted to go into your room and you come into mine and we'll just play.
[244:59.41]I think people would have known immediately.
[245:06.89]I think that would have been instantaneously.
[245:12.74]I would sound so much better on your microphone.
[245:18.51]I only had the camera on sometime.
[245:20.15]That's what I was asking.
[245:20.93]I was like, hey, I'm like, hey, is your webcam on right now?
[245:24.93]But I would have to leave it like full unmuted.
[245:27.15]Because you wouldn't know where the button was.
[245:30.15]Yeah, I wouldn't know where it was.
[245:33.47]I'd have to sneak into your room.
[245:36.23]But, all right, final thoughts.
[245:38.03]Final thoughts on episode one, Stand Alone, Man of Medan.
[245:44.89]I would say...
[245:47.40]I like the idea of the shared co-op play with a friend horror game.
[245:53.22]Don't buy it unless you're going to play it in five player local and everybody pitches in.
[246:00.79]True.
[246:02.05]But it's also... It's $6 a person.
[246:05.81]It opens the door.
[246:07.99]Couch co-op.
[246:11.55]You can play couch co-op local with five players.
[246:15.57]Have a little movie night for three and a half hours and pass the controller around.
[246:20.24]Yeah.
[246:21.32]You can just have fun with it.
[246:23.29]I think it opens the door for potentially having horror games and having co-op experiences that are like that kind of way out experience.
[246:32.70]Try to do more of that.
[246:34.76]Hey, you're both playing at the same time, but you're not doing the same things.
[246:37.48]But you are.
[246:38.02]But you aren't.
[246:38.56]But are you?
[246:39.34]You are.
[246:40.96]It's an interesting take on co-op.
[246:42.22]It just wasn't very good.
[246:44.80]I don't think it was very good.
[246:45.46]There was nothing in between the moments.
[246:50.06]There were like probably four story beats in the game, but the only thing you do between there is kind of you walk down the hall and there's a piece of paper at the end.
[246:57.53]And then the next thing happened.
[247:01.25]Yeah, it was a lot of hallway walking.
[247:04.27]And I mean, let's okay, here are the pros to this game.
[247:09.71]It's very, very, very, very nice looking game.
[247:13.78]I thought, like, the... Especially when they did close-ups.
[247:17.86]I thought it was fucking fantastic graphics until they showed their teeth.
[247:22.50]I didn't dislike any of the actual actors or the voice actors.
[247:26.62]I thought that was all good.
[247:35.59]Yeah.
[247:38.81]I was holding up to no comment, to no response.
[247:45.03]graphics were fine yeah it's it was just kind of it was it was a it was until dawn until dawn was so much better like until dawn was five letter grades how come halfway through the game there was a literal I am the captain now look at me yeah I am inevitable yeah I just it felt weird that did happen
[248:10.37]That did happen, like, more than once.
[248:12.56]And there were a couple, like, dialogue options that just were out of nowhere.
[248:21.74]What do you mean?
[248:23.15]Um... Like... Could you explain that again to me, but in, like, not nerd terms so I can understand?
[248:33.22]And they would just...
[248:36.20]I remember when you were like, tonal shift.
[248:38.57]Kind of weird, right?
[248:39.59]Yeah.
[248:41.41]At least they said the name of the stream.
[248:45.63]Yeah, I did ruin Alex's proposal to Julia.
[248:48.99]He proposed to Julia underwater when they were diving.
[248:53.15]What?
[248:54.29]And I told him that he was being stupid.
[248:57.37]Damn.
[249:01.55]But that's the end of that.
[249:05.53]That's the end of Man of Badan.
[249:12.05]I haven't gone to the bathroom in four hours.
[249:14.83]And that's a first for me.
[249:17.43]I'm gonna go pee.
[249:21.41]Are you coming?
[249:22.51]Okay.
[249:24.16]I'll be back.
[249:26.90]What time is it?
[249:28.94]It's been about four hours.
[249:30.14]I'm not sure there's anything else.
[249:32.36]Is there anything else we can do for like an hour?
[249:35.86]Mmm... Maybe... Mmm... What was the point of this satanic book?
[249:45.88]Yeah!
[249:46.50]Yeah!
[249:47.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[249:48.24]Did you actually find a satanic book?
[249:49.47]No, that wasn't... I wasn't full of shit there.
[249:50.95]I found a Satan room with a Satan book, and it told me all these Satan spells.
[249:55.49]Was it just a red herring?
[249:57.05]I think it was just a hallucination, yeah.
[249:58.83]It was just... that was not real, and I was making it all up.
[250:02.65]See how fast you can kill everyone in the game.
[250:07.79]You want to try to just kill everybody as fast as we can?
[250:09.73]That's not a bad idea.
[250:11.53]Just fail every QT?
[250:13.87]Yeah, let's try to kill everybody as fast as possible.
[250:15.65]See what happens.
[250:17.17]Alright, yeah, that's what we're going to do.
[250:19.05]We're going to play the game again, but we're going to kill everyone as soon as possible and try to do it in less than 30 minutes.
[250:25.07]I'll be right back.
[250:25.59]I'm going to go pee.
[250:27.39]I'll just mute you and everything.
[250:34.44]I'll be right back, guys.
[250:35.70]Peek.
[252:41.16]Hello.
[252:46.30]Hey.
[252:48.32]Yo, did you get disconnected?
[252:51.34]Did I?
[252:52.68]Did I?
[252:53.44]Oh, we went down.
[252:56.72]Yep.
[252:57.68]I turned off the Veep.
[253:01.91]So does the VPN have a problem?
[253:05.91]Yeah, it looks like the VPN lost connection.
[253:09.31]Huh.
[253:10.88]Well, that's irritating, but...
[253:47.73]People are saying it's Twitch.
[253:51.61]People are saying this is not.
[253:52.53]I don't believe it is.
[253:54.11]Why would it be working?
[253:55.53]We both went down at the same time.
[253:56.91]People are saying Twitch's servers are shitting the bed right now.
[253:59.01]A bunch of streamers are going offline.
[254:01.11]Oh, maybe so.
[254:02.54]Maybe it's not the VPN.
[254:04.24]Either way, it's not Cox.
[254:05.90]Yeah, it's not an internet issue.
[254:09.22]Apparently.
[254:09.74]For once.
[254:14.58]It's Twitch, apparently.
[254:17.29]Okay.
[254:18.37]um you want you ready to try this see if we can do this I'm gonna say we should start like halfway through the story um is it possible to skip like dialogue I'm assuming we can probably we can probably just go to the part where the boat gets
[254:40.81]Well, I think if we wanted to start from the beginning, if you just don't look at anything other than the next objective, doesn't that just throw the story into the next beat?
[254:53.06]Because you can't fail a bunch of QTEs as the two sailors.
[254:59.06]Can you start from the chapter after we do the punching QTE and Fortune?
[255:05.33]That's what I'm saying.
[255:06.33]Yeah, we should just skip the prologue.
[255:09.69]I got an invite for you.
[255:15.97]Bunch of QT.
[255:16.77]Alright, so scene selection.
[255:19.83]We've got Chinese market, the Duke.
[255:23.91]So, Chinese market, I believe, is... This is all you.
[255:28.64]The Duke is the boat.
[255:30.22]So, like, we can't just skip that Chinese market part.
[255:35.30]We have to start at that when we are all on the boat.
[255:40.56]Okay, we're just going to start at the Duke.
[255:41.98]And here we go.
[255:42.88]Start the timer now.
[255:50.01]Here we go.
[256:01.58]Alright, try to get as fast as we can.
[256:02.76]Have everyone just say nothing.
[256:10.23]Yeah, just only, just don't talk.
[256:19.90]I'm trying to skip.
[256:24.32]Alright, here come the fears.
[256:32.02]Uh oh.
[256:37.53]We got twitched.
[256:39.39]Wait, we did?
[256:41.55]Are you down?
[256:41.93]Are you zero?
[256:43.47]Yep.
[256:44.60]I'm... Oh, fuck.
[256:45.32]Well, if you're not, then I guess we'll just keep going.
[256:47.20]But it's just getting kind of miserable.
[256:48.96]Yeah.
[256:49.82]This might be like a... This is making no sense.
[256:57.67]Apparently Twitch is just going down.
[256:59.85]Because you're fine, right?
[257:03.73]Yeah, I'm fine.
[257:04.34]Completely.
[257:04.90]Like 100%.
[257:05.26]Okay.
[257:05.90]So it's... Are you on VPN right now?
[257:07.94]No.
[257:10.94]Me neither.
[257:11.92]So...
[257:13.77]Yeah, something's going on.
[257:15.15]Who's DDoSing Twitch?
[257:16.83]I don't know.
[257:17.21]That's a good question.
[257:20.97]Let's just try to get rid of somebody here.
[257:22.44]Well, the thing is I... Oh, you're out of the game?
[257:26.38]No, I'm going to have to alt-tab in a second.
[257:30.04]And that's going to force pause the game.
[257:32.52]There's Alex.
[257:36.42]I'm going to try changing servers.
[257:38.50]Well, thankfully, this all started really happening when we finished the game.
[257:42.52]Yes.
[257:51.41]Think we got enough?
[257:52.75]If we run out, we can always call for backup.
[257:54.69]Alright, say nothing.
[257:55.85]So, uh, look.
[257:57.73]I've never been down there before.
[257:59.47]Down?
[257:59.87]Alright, I gotta water real quick.
[258:04.01]Don't blame me.
[258:05.31]Blame Twitch.
[258:07.09]No, um, no one's blaming you.
[258:10.70]Don't worry.
[258:12.48]I'm blaming me.
[258:14.58]I wanna see what happens.
[258:20.48]Let me know when you're ready.
[258:25.69]Are you playing different characters to see this stuff?
[258:27.92]No, we're trying to see how fast we can have somebody die.
[258:33.26]We're not going real fast.
[258:34.84]We're going at lightning speed at the moment.
[258:37.40]All right, let's try here.
[258:49.83]You doing a new server?
[258:51.97]Yeah.
[258:52.63]Yeah.
[258:58.04]Okay.
[258:59.31]Try again.
[259:02.85]Twitch TV server problems.
[259:05.95]Ready.
[259:08.93]Choose an EU server?
[259:09.75]Um, I don't know if we feel to keep our up that high.
[259:21.82]Alright.
[259:22.69]Say nothing.
[259:23.89]Always.
[259:28.63]I think he was gonna say something there too.
[259:31.09]Uh...
[259:57.50]is is it is it a ddos you tag along no I mean the internet's fine it's just well no I'm done people are saying that there it is like up to twitch or something all right amigo calvary's almost here cool sorry I'm a little snappy I'm just when you medical school would be stressful you know total shocker and man that long distance thing julia it's been rough
[260:24.20]Just random people saying that.
[260:25.42]Yeah.
[260:25.70]Well, then I'm like, yeah, it's probably not her.
[260:29.56]Huh?
[260:31.20]Yep.
[260:31.98]I'm just very shy.
[260:33.90]Conrad doesn't think I love beer.
[260:35.32]Me too.
[260:36.04]Ah.
[260:36.72]I guess I keep these in an undisclosed location.
[260:38.82]Flushing.
[260:47.05]Hey.
[260:48.47]So, uh, can I get your input on something?
[260:51.67]Yeah, what?
[260:52.67]Just, uh,
[260:54.40]Kind of a big thing I'm trying to make a decision about.
[260:56.64]About finishing med school?
[260:59.78]And you said no.
[261:01.28]So you were talking about wanting to do this, and then down there you said no.
[261:06.14]Imagine if him being in med school allowed him to solve anyone's medical problems throughout this game.
[261:15.17]Or if that character backstory was written after the rest of the game.
[261:21.53]Teeth.
[261:24.00]No one's figured it out yet.
[261:24.96]Is this going to take another three hours?
[261:35.29]I hope.
[261:37.57]No, I hope not.
[261:41.25]Watch it, sis.
[261:42.88]Lady killer.
[261:43.46]Right here.
[261:45.78]Good to finally meet you, Conrad.
[261:47.93]This is Brad, by the way.
[261:48.87]My little bro.
[261:49.97]Hey.
[261:50.49]Bradley!
[261:51.03]I feel like I already know you.
[261:52.55]I've heard so much about you.
[261:54.11]Alright, so remember, every dangerous potential scenario, do the option that is trying to get that person killed.
[262:02.90]So is that Julia?
[262:04.72]Yeah.
[262:05.58]Is Julia blonde by the end of the game?
[262:07.30]She's blonde now?
[262:07.64]Maybe it's just the lighting.
[262:08.62]She can keep up this time?
[262:22.95]Whoa, whoa, cool down.
[262:24.35]Don't go crazy with excitement.
[262:28.77]We'll both do it.
[262:30.03]That's so funny.
[262:31.95]What a boring, shitty playthrough this could be if you really wanted it to be.
[262:35.41]Yeah.
[262:37.51]Absolutely no personality.
[262:39.54]No personality, no decision-making.
[262:41.24]I like my main character's blank slate.
[262:43.82]I like to put myself into their shoes.
[262:53.98]I'd invite you to make yourselves at home, but, uh... So is everybody on board and ready to go?
[263:05.98]So it turned out that she was full of shit about the, like, don't disturb dead people thing.
[263:10.70]Oh, yeah.
[263:11.38]You're selling.
[263:12.00]I'm buying.
[263:16.29]They weren't cursed at all.
[263:17.37]It was just the military miasma.
[263:30.71]All right, when's the first scenario where everyone can just die?
[263:34.03]Well, there's an underwater segment here in a second, isn't there?
[263:38.01]There is, yeah.
[263:38.49]And the barbecue explosions?
[263:40.63]Mm-hmm.
[263:42.24]But you already messed that up.
[263:44.76]Yeah, all right.
[263:45.72]What's the fastest way we can get out of this?
[263:47.74]Is just go say, we're ready, right?
[263:49.92]What about over here?
[263:52.67]That's pretty far out of the way.
[263:54.54]I'm currently scrolling through the iPad.
[263:57.64]Listen, to be honest, I've never heard of this wreck you're looking for.
[264:00.68]Usually these things are crawling with divers.
[264:03.24]Yeah.
[264:03.98]Look at this.
[264:04.82]This one's different.
[264:05.78]I'm just saying, if it gets too late, I know some nice places where you can just take a nice dive.
[264:17.50]Just think about it.
[264:19.66]I'm going to go help Conrad and Julia with the camera.
[264:23.84]I'm just so slow to process all information.
[264:32.71]Feast your eyes on this.
[264:34.57]Whoa, hey, look at that.
[264:36.39]What is it?
[264:36.95]Looks like a bomber.
[264:37.95]Can you zoom in?
[264:39.49]Oh, yeah, definitely a B-29.
[264:41.13]That's good, right?
[264:42.61]Are kittens good?
[264:44.09]Are miniature horses good?
[264:45.41]Brad, hey, I freaking nailed it, bro.
[264:47.80]Don't I get a little end zone dance?
[264:50.06]Watch me.
[264:51.22]Oh, yeah.
[264:52.42]Oh, yeah.
[264:55.08]So?
[264:55.14]So, the B-29 is a superfortress.
[264:58.39]During World War II, they built these suckers to cruise at the highest altitude possible while maintaining the ability to carry nuclear warheads.
[265:04.54]They were just, like, so dope.
[265:06.76]Ah, so dope.
[265:08.08]Oh, my God.
[265:10.04]Look at me.
[265:10.70]Sorry, yeah.
[265:11.94]Look at me.
[265:13.18]Oh, please, keep going.
[265:14.31]Fliss, we found a plane.
[265:18.01]Yeah?
[265:18.53]Yeah, looks like World War II.
[265:20.19]We are ready to dive.
[265:23.17]Technically, we should call this in to port authorities as an unreported wreck.
[265:27.72]Well, technically.
[265:30.12]Are you sure you don't want to do this the right way?
[265:34.96]Have a good think about that one before you respond.
[265:38.82]Guys, no one knows, no one cares.
[265:41.11]No harm, no foul.
[265:42.17]The computer is starting to answer for us.
[265:50.03]Look, we paid for this guy.
[265:51.95]Generously, we're dying.
[265:53.34]The AI is taking over.
[265:55.74]They have to push the story along somehow.
[266:00.10]Say nothing is an illusion.
[266:02.29]Can you imagine?
[266:03.07]Untouched?
[266:05.13]I am going to do some reading up on B-29s.
[266:11.16]So, what happens if we don't control the game at all?
[266:19.40]I tried that, and eventually it just forced me to go to the next area.
[266:23.64]I still don't know what happened.
[266:26.37]I may have pulled you.
[266:27.33]Yeah, no, it was unexplainable.
[266:30.17]Okay, we're gonna have to move.
[266:38.43]We both just stood here for ten full minutes.
[266:42.06]Hold on.
[266:42.58]What's the thing that moves us along?
[266:43.92]Yeah, I think we have to go downstairs.
[266:46.19]I have to go downstairs and then they call us back up.
[266:52.35]Oh, wait, no.
[266:52.73]You're down in that new cutscene area.
[266:55.04]I can't go in there.
[266:55.64]Oh, yeah, I can.
[266:56.74]Okay, here we go.
[267:05.30]I don't... Yeah, I have to do this.
[267:06.12]I have to just... I don't know what's going on.
[267:09.32]I feel like these... There's no...
[267:29.91]I get Blitz has a rule, but man, it'd be cool as hell just to get my hands on some little relic from my first wreck.
[267:35.97]It's like, oh, relationship updated.
[267:37.37]You've seen that like a bunch of times in the top left of the screen, right?
[267:40.71]Yeah, I don't know what it means.
[267:41.78]What the fuck does that mean?
[267:42.98]None of this even does anything.
[267:43.98]It's kind of like Alex will remember that.
[267:46.64]Yeah, but they don't.
[267:49.34]Maybe it only matters if you're a single player?
[267:51.54]I don't know.
[267:53.12]Because the AI has to control some of the reactions.
[267:58.55]He's stoned out of his mind.
[268:03.22]Alright, here we go.
[268:05.84]You can't go in there.
[268:06.84]I know, but we have to do all the random things and then she goes, tanks are ready!
[268:10.16]What am I looking at here?
[268:24.12]What is this a painting of?
[268:25.28]This premonition here.
[268:26.80]Is that just of the storm?
[268:29.56]Where Brad is like, oh no.
[268:31.67]Just let it do its thing.
[268:40.19]Oh yeah, it didn't have to be annoying.
[268:41.69]Alright, let's do it.
[268:42.77]Oh, I'm doing it.
[268:53.86]You doing it?
[268:54.86]I'm doing it.
[269:06.68]I think we're in good shape.
[269:08.14]It's probably not a bad idea for you to have a clue how these things work.
[269:11.24]Gotta say, I'm not too happy with our captain at the moment.
[269:13.82]This may as well be striking human.
[269:15.58]I'm just an android.
[269:17.27]It hasn't been programmed yet.
[269:21.59]If she tries to keep me from doing this dive one more time, that's it.
[269:25.39]Gloves off.
[269:26.29]That's fair.
[269:27.15]Just don't force her hand.
[269:31.04]I'm gonna get these rebreathers set up and then we'll go through the final steps together.
[269:34.34]Cool.
[269:36.44]Nothing to say?
[269:38.84]You know what?
[269:40.40]Fine.
[269:41.82]Do what you want.
[269:42.88]You're not gonna listen to me anyways.
[269:45.26]But if you take one thing from that wreck, you're gonna make us all criminals.
[269:54.01]Relationship updated.
[269:59.01]What about me?
[270:02.00]Nobody ended up being a traitor.
[270:07.36]Nobody got into any kind of relationship.
[270:12.11]Well, the people were gonna get married, I guess, but... Oh, shit, this is a hard one.
[270:31.41]Like, if you're silent for this long, through this many questions, you might be a serial killer.
[270:39.54]No, you just don't like fucking acid.
[270:41.18]For all you know, this could be a war grave.
[270:44.44]Disturbing it would be illegal and immoral.
[270:52.18]They just said to cool it with your desperate pickup bullshit.
[270:55.46]I haven't said a word as Conrad the entire game.
[270:58.43]Respect the rules down there.
[270:59.93]Don't do anything stupid that'll get my ass in trouble.
[271:02.45]Enjoy the sights for a little while.
[271:04.61]And by enjoy the sights... I haven't said anything.
[271:07.53]No, nothing.
[271:08.47]Yeah, I got it.
[271:09.37]Gross.
[271:09.77]Hey, at least I'm honest.
[271:11.65]Still gross.
[271:13.22]All right, are we ready to go in?
[271:16.04]He's so desperate, he said nothing.
[272:03.49]I'm standing next to you.
[272:05.35]I'm standing right next to you.
[272:06.53]Like, as if I can see as far as you.
[272:08.81]There's nothing to even find out here.
[272:12.65]Maybe there is.
[272:14.11]This is freaking me out.
[272:14.83]What the fuck?
[272:23.04]I just got a little oopsie.
[272:27.26]Are you... What?
[272:29.94]Oh, you just took me out of it.
[272:33.86]I was in a trance.
[272:34.87]The camera zoomed it on my face.
[272:36.37]I was in a trance.
[272:41.87]I hit.
[272:42.59]Are you up?
[272:43.65]Yeah, I'm up.
[272:47.16]At this point, if it happens, it happens.
[272:49.24]We just go.
[272:49.56]You know what I'm saying?
[272:56.78]Did I not press A?
[272:58.30]What is going on?
[273:01.53]Jerma has to talk to Juliet.
[273:02.89]I already did.
[273:03.77]You guys are gonna enter the game world, maybe.
[273:26.43]Yeah, we're not going down at the same time, so if you have the squad stream open, no one's missing anything.
[273:31.88]Oh, yeah.
[273:32.70]Good old squad stream.
[273:38.12]Ready to take the plunge?
[273:39.54]Oh, hey, guys.
[273:41.06]What?
[273:41.32]Jesus, why are you so loud?
[273:42.76]I almost completely forgot.
[273:44.04]When I was looking at the dive cam, I saw this huge hole in the tail.
[273:47.25]I probably should put, like, a disclaimer somewhere, like, on this top of the stream that just says, this is a fuckface run.
[273:53.95]Someone has definitely come in.
[273:56.63]Like, oh, good.
[273:58.19]I got here just in time.
[273:59.03]We just started.
[274:00.93]Can't wait to see what they do next.
[274:03.71]Say nothing.
[274:04.55]I'm not taking any of this stuff.
[274:15.16]And now I have nothing to say.
[274:16.70]I'm so high.
[274:23.88]God, come on.
[274:26.64]These two are baked out of their minds.
[274:28.98]This is just like... They're just husks.
[274:34.94]Ah, shit.
[274:35.54]What should I do?
[274:42.77]You're not in a good state to go down there.
[274:45.65]No, you shouldn't be going down here.
[274:47.27]All right, so there's a moment in the plane when I take off the rebreather and swim into a cramped location.
[275:09.33]But there's a QTE, so I want to see if that does anything.
[275:12.45]I think you're Conrad.
[275:15.77]You were on grill duty.
[275:17.85]Wait, what?
[275:18.51]I mean, I'm seeing the underwater segment.
[275:22.73]Weren't you just Conrad and wasn't I Alex?
[275:24.94]Yeah, we got swapped last time, though.
[275:26.48]Did we get switched again here?
[275:32.60]Howdy, Captain.
[275:33.76]No, I'm... Oh, yeah, it did swap us.
[275:36.13]You?
[275:37.38]are not my second in command third in command no fresh and eager cabin boy still I know your well-paying dashingly handsome seafaring client is requesting the pleasure of your company over a frosty amber liquid oh she's been infected okay you snooze you lose pretty nice ride you got here where'd you get the cash
[276:03.36]I feel like it'd be cool for a game about choices to give you a choice as to who you want to be.
[276:08.10]That's true, yeah.
[276:09.30]Like, we just take turns each chapter choosing which squad to go with.
[276:16.02]I really hope that I can just burn the boat down.
[276:18.35]It's not gonna happen, though.
[276:19.33]I'm gonna get stepped over.
[276:20.23]I'm gonna get stepped over...
[276:34.26]It's gonna happen anyways.
[276:35.28]Well, I just got a cut on my leg and tetanus, so... No, put it down.
[277:03.33]Hey there, how's it hanging?
[277:10.87]I get it.
[277:11.87]Busy, busy, busy.
[277:13.57]You can monitor the dive while I do some boat maintenance.
[277:15.85]Not a prob, Bob.
[277:16.61]Do you think it's going to say that it's weird?
[277:29.06]That to play multiplayer, you don't...
[277:32.88]Not alone?
[277:34.38]Yeah, that is weird.
[277:37.66]It's like they know that we're real gamers.
[277:39.88]Here comes like a storm.
[277:43.01]Why do I say weather looks clear?
[277:45.39]Hey, the weather looks clear.
[277:47.69]Doesn't like a storm come?
[277:50.21]Wait, did we even do the thing?
[277:58.66]Did you do the barbecue yet?
[278:01.12]Did I?
[278:01.50]No, no.
[278:02.34]I'm just... Now I have to... I'm swimming with the fishes.
[278:07.49]I got no mask on and I'm not gonna be pushing any buttons here.
[278:14.57]Where's the boat?
[278:15.51]I just saw it.
[278:23.22]What the fuck is going on?
[278:24.10]Three?
[278:24.72]Uh...
[278:34.11]What happened?
[278:35.65]Did you go make popcorn during the segment where she's drowning?
[278:39.57]Are you doing something here?
[278:42.41]Well, I hoped that she was going to die, but no, she's actually fine.
[278:47.59]I have no control over the game right now.
[278:49.62]There were three separate failed QTEs to get out of this pipe.
[278:56.74]Which I feel like is... I can't get out.
[279:03.40]Yeah, B doesn't do anything.
[279:05.23]I'm pressing B. What did I do?
[279:07.03]Okay, Italics, I think you need to come rescue me.
[279:13.79]Do I need to do something?
[279:18.48]Yeah, I'm stuck.
[279:19.68]I'm looking just at the front of the boat.
[279:21.12]I'm going as fast as I can.
[279:34.46]it actually needed to wait for you how dare you talk I was silent last time when I played the real game where I don't they don't they come aboard what's going on here where's the where's your like boat friends hello again little blip what you doing all the way out here
[280:04.75]They said italics is breaking character.
[280:08.37]I did say something.
[280:09.85]I chose a dialogue option.
[280:14.02]But I was silent when we played the actual game.
[280:23.23]There's nothing here.
[280:24.39]There's nobody here.
[280:32.11]Hey, don't worry about it.
[280:33.89]If you could just pull that open, why was I gonna shimmy it with a knife?
[280:37.41]Maybe that's their buoy.
[280:39.39]Maybe... I... Gotcha, Chad.
[280:46.87]We want 100%, not 98%.
[280:47.41]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[281:00.01]Do they... Alright, I'm getting ready to break the ship, so that should be your cue.
[281:04.67]Okay, you're breaking the ship?
[281:07.71]I'm breaking the plane.
[281:08.53]Alright, hold on.
[281:16.14]Don't do it yet.
[281:16.66]Uh...
[281:26.71]Okay, you just did it, alright.
[281:29.03]Well, I'm going to zero, so.
[281:34.36]They got me.
[281:35.08]Wait, didn't we just do this?
[281:42.36]I guess I haven't... They're like, coming right over to us.
[281:50.33]oh this I don't think this did that happen last time they just take off they don't even stop yeah this happened last time yeah I thought I broke the plane look at our boat we can take care of this man it's not a problem what do you think like uh 10 bucks cover it
[282:19.56]Whoops, my bad.
[282:20.19]Let's make it 20.
[282:20.99]20?
[282:22.63]No, make it 30.
[282:24.41]More like 30.
[282:25.03]I can do 30.
[282:26.29]More like 40.
[282:27.69]Alright, you guys drive a hard bargain, but I'm with you.
[282:30.13]Here, let's just throw in the whole pot.
[282:34.16]You know, I think this whole thing could have been avoided if you had just handed this person the money.
[282:40.16]No!
[282:40.30]You know what I mean?
[282:42.28]Like, hey, come over here and let me hand you the money.
[282:45.50]I guess I didn't need the money.
[282:47.10]That could have been like, hey, I really want to pay for this.
[282:48.72]That was like, yeah, I'm sorry, man.
[282:50.32]Hey, we're back.
[282:53.48]Hello.
[282:54.98]You going on a little brain trip there, Flissy?
[282:57.39]You're a piece of work, Conrad.
[282:59.27]I'm not all work.
[283:00.07]I'm a little play, too.
[283:01.73]Are you trying to flirt with me?
[283:03.85]Is it working?
[283:04.71]I don't even know what it is.
[283:06.69]Well, when you think of something, I'll just be over here taking in the view, flirting up a storm.
[283:11.26]Hashtag wink.
[283:12.48]All right, I have to put a disclaimer on the top of the stream.
[283:16.00]Guys, hold on.
[283:17.50]I didn't... I didn't do enough in my playthrough to get proposed to this time.
[283:22.81]He doesn't like me anymore.
[283:25.81]I gotta write like.
[283:27.07]He doesn't like me.
[283:35.17]This somehow feels worse than saying no to a marriage proposal is knowing that they were gonna propose but you did something and now they're not going to.
[283:44.71]Feels bad, man.
[283:46.94]This has to be up here.
[283:51.57]Wait, it's gotta be one word.
[283:53.57]Not two words.
[283:57.61]It has to be one word.
[284:01.49]This is not... Okay, there.
[284:03.52]That's better.
[284:08.22]What are you trying to type?
[284:09.36]It's not important.
[284:14.47]By the way, as to the missing text, I did have Discord open the entire stream.
[284:18.03]So if you had just typed it, I would have seen it.
[284:21.40]Oh.
[284:22.58]Well, I'm fucking stupid.
[284:23.50]Don't worry.
[284:29.50]Okay, I think they're on their way back up.
[284:31.24]And I was getting used to it just being you and me.
[284:33.10]We need to light the grill.
[284:34.06]Oh, pick me.
[284:34.72]Pick me.
[284:35.38]Call me Grill Capitan.
[284:37.42]You may light the grill, but I will never call you that.
[284:42.15]Here we go.
[284:48.88]Let's see.
[284:50.94]Oh, I have to make a decision this time.
[284:52.38]Son of a bitch.
[284:58.22]You have to go.
[284:58.72]I have to make a choice to try to kill.
[285:01.85]Yeah, of course.
[285:12.77]Damn, Fliss, I'm sorry.
[285:16.30]So what's the easiest way to kill anybody?
[285:18.20]Why is it just looking sad at him?
[285:21.72]Why?
[285:22.48]Nothing happened.
[285:24.53]Okay, fail every quick time event.
[285:26.17]This is where it happens.
[285:29.63]Have you not been doing that?
[285:31.51]I've only gotten one chance.
[285:45.03]Why was there only one explosion then?
[285:46.25]I just had a little trouble firing up the grill.
[285:49.33]Conrad, what is wrong with you?
[285:59.26]Whatever.
[285:59.68]It's like they're seeing shit.
[286:01.40]They say a sentence and then they like just get lost, like super, like in their own head.
[286:07.08]Yeah, it's like... Unfortunately, we did not leave it as pristine as we could have.
[286:11.91]What?
[286:12.90]What's wrong with you?
[286:13.92]Whoa.
[286:16.90]That's a cool looking thing up in the sky.
[286:20.79]Alright.
[286:21.59]It's time.
[286:30.02]Oh, and then everybody survived.
[286:34.78]Weirdly enough, I don't know how it's possible when it's not possible.
[286:38.90]Got ya, Winkie.
[286:43.33]Yeah, I noticed you haven't been saying anything.
[286:47.53]Alex and his little brother Brad, trying to swim with the big fish, both seem out of their depth.
[286:55.64]He just looked down.
[286:56.10]That was a scripted line.
[286:57.66]He read that.
[286:58.94]His script is in the book.
[287:00.58]That was a really good line he didn't write.
[287:04.68]A bold fellow, you might say.
[287:07.28]Or maybe you'd say arrogant.
[287:10.44]And then there's Captain Fliss.
[287:12.76]Strong, forthright, stubborn.
[287:17.20]She appears somewhat immune to Conrad's charms.
[287:21.67]So far, at least.
[287:24.63]Let me reassure you.
[287:26.07]Let's get his heads, too.
[287:27.01]To make some decisions they'll value later on.
[287:31.61]I failed to stream QTE and I'm back at zero.
[287:34.63]Really?
[287:34.93]It hasn't happened to me since the last time.
[287:39.98]But we're not on the same server, though.
[287:41.08]You're going somewhere else, right?
[287:51.45]Oh, we get the beers and shit.
[287:52.25]Hold on.
[287:53.05]I'm gonna change it again.
[287:54.81]We get the beers, and we sit around, and we do a beer thing.
[288:11.99]Brewskies.
[288:20.22]Action.
[288:23.77]Silent, scary story incoming.
[288:30.45]Well, it was like traveling through time and accidentally ending up in a dimension where the past is underwater and like everything is covered in barnacles and sharks.
[288:38.12]Sharks?
[288:38.96]It was a great reef.
[288:40.64]Hey, I thought it was pretty intense.
[288:43.16]Wasn't Comrade going to get us some more beers after he helped Fliss?
[288:47.04]Maybe he decided, hey, I'll drink some.
[288:49.34]And then he got drunk.
[288:50.60]And since he was drunk, he forgot to bring it to us.
[288:52.90]And he just kept on drinking and he drank all of it.
[288:54.85]I can't wait to hear your scary story.
[288:56.15]Oh, that's right.
[288:56.49]I'll go look for him.
[289:00.59]I didn't even- I forgot about that.
[289:03.39]That's gonna be a terrible story.
[289:05.27]It's gonna be a good one, yeah.
[289:12.24]You're right.
[289:12.72]Oh god, what's going on?
[289:17.86]This is giving me secondhand anxiety.
[289:32.83]okay that's enough of that you get them beers oh yeah the beers I was just getting them now why is it so much better like this it's not working this game becomes like a letter grade higher with the do nothing road
[290:00.44]Now that everybody's here, let's take a look at the navigator's path.
[290:03.28]Boyfriend was trying to understand my inner thoughts.
[290:05.84]Where'd you put it?
[290:06.96]It's in your case.
[290:07.74]Okay, I'll go get it.
[290:09.03]If I have to say, he did not find them.
[290:14.71]You got the map pad, Divemaster?
[290:16.37]Yeah, I have to... Guys, I have to say that I'm going to talk.
[290:20.57]Because I have to tell the story.
[290:22.65]Alright, I'm just going to stop my stream.
[290:25.23]Are you down again?
[290:26.11]May as well, yeah.
[290:28.01]What?
[290:29.78]Oh shit!
[290:30.14]He keeps saying nothing.
[290:31.52]Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[290:58.26]Fine, we'll go with the path.
[290:59.58]Wait, did I just ruin everything?
[291:02.63]I think that's what I was originally on.
[291:07.43]Because, well, I went down to zero, like, twice.
[291:10.21]Maybe that server is doing better now?
[291:12.93]I don't know.
[291:14.85]Okay, and... Action.
[291:18.36]In three, two, one.
[291:23.14]Let's go.
[291:24.70]DDoS, go away.
[291:30.91]Wait, I don't tell a story.
[291:31.77]All right, I have to say I will tell a story.
[291:34.35]What?
[291:59.93]This is... This is just... Here it comes.
[292:03.59]Here comes the story.
[292:04.55]Oh, that actually happened.
[292:06.74]My choice matters.
[292:15.91]Not always.
[292:17.37]Sometimes the bends can be super delayed.
[292:19.33]It could be hours or a day or two.
[292:21.93]The bends?
[292:23.09]Yeah, it's when you come up from a dive too fast.
[292:26.30]Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
[292:27.78]Decompression sickness.
[292:29.28]Nerd.
[292:30.43]Little nitrogen bubbles that get stuck in your bloodstream.
[292:32.65]Hurts like a bitch.
[292:33.83]It's really serious.
[292:35.05]Divers get sick and die from decompression sickness every year.
[292:37.43]And that is why the good Dr. Conrad says drink them if you got them, because either you're fine or you're gonna want a little something to ease the pain.
[292:43.41]Julia, I'm telling you not to drink any alcohol right now.
[292:46.58]Oh, come on.
[292:47.70]Telling you?
[292:48.96]Take orders from this guy?
[292:50.10]Just drink a beer.
[292:58.52]I will take that as a no then that was long that became really sad that was just like whoa who wants to find some sunken treasure so what do you think captain coordinates those are coordinates all right maybe the plane's destination you think we could get there by tomorrow it takes a couple hours if the weather stays steady wow
[293:21.12]I've got a story for you.
[293:22.82]Well, don't everyone talk at once?
[293:24.71]What does it even matter?
[293:49.02]You should have never gone down to that plane in the first place.
[293:52.00]It's bad luck.
[293:53.20]You think you can scavenge down there and it makes no difference, but every single thing you bring back has an essence.
[293:58.11]I can hear that.
[293:58.91]It's like a ghost you invite to the surface.
[294:00.37]Here we go.
[294:01.55]I can hear what she's saying.
[294:03.49]You never think about much of anything.
[294:05.07]Can you?
[294:05.63]She's just like, I don't even want to be here right now.
[294:07.19]They're not cool ghost stories.
[294:09.56]Not like for fun.
[294:11.38]People drown in these waters and you have to respect their resting place.
[294:14.68]Damn straight.
[294:16.38]Fred.
[294:17.40]you got a fun ghost story right I do that is now now that say yes and then yeah I heard a story happened right around here too let's hear it let's hear it I'll use a good show okay here goes
[294:42.13]This story is true.
[294:43.63]It had happened right near here, in an old lighthouse.
[294:46.63]Ooh, in an old lighthouse.
[294:48.79]True story?
[294:49.91]Where'd you hear this?
[294:57.36]Come on, now.
[294:58.28]Brad.
[294:58.64]Reveal your sources.
[294:59.58]Brad, you all right?
[295:00.34]The lighthouse stood atop an atoll, isolated from the rest of the world, a lone beacon in the night, a sailor's respite.
[295:08.41]The lighthouse keeper would hear the waves.
[295:10.31]Are you telling this story?
[295:11.43]Sure.
[295:12.27]It's doing it on.
[295:12.95]It's doing it on.
[295:13.57]I can't control it.
[295:15.13]Covered in blood.
[295:16.57]She's stumbling down the beach.
[295:18.25]He hurries to her aid and she falls into his arms, sobbing.
[295:21.51]As he hurries her back to the lighthouse, he asks where she's from.
[295:24.80]He doesn't waste any time.
[295:26.46]Smooth.
[295:30.68]She just did a gym from the office.
[295:35.03]The woman answers.
[295:36.21]We got it.
[295:36.69]We finally got one.
[295:38.81]My parents are upstairs right now.
[295:41.32]Of course, the lighthouse keeper says, that isn't so.
[295:44.30]Of course, he's lived there alone for years.
[295:46.48]And the woman becomes hysterical and insists her parents are upstairs.
[295:50.18]So, they go to the top of the lighthouse and there, splayed out on the floor, is a man and a woman brutally murdered with an axe.
[295:57.81]Always an axe?
[295:58.99]I mean, do people even use axes anymore?
[296:05.90]Do they, Brad?
[296:07.22]Okay.
[296:08.18]We're sticking with Ashton.
[296:11.07]He's pissed that you interrupted his story.
[296:13.85]Like, just let him talk.
[296:15.94]A fourth wall break from YouTube.
[296:18.06]Oh, that's so funny.
[296:20.26]Who did it?
[296:28.87]he doesn't want to finish the story anymore because you interrupted a woman's husband right so the lighthouse keeper creeps over to the closet opens the door and sure enough there's a man inside but he's cut his own throat horrified he looks closer to see the dead man's face in the dark closer closer
[296:53.02]And he sees.
[296:54.36]It's his own face.
[296:57.08]And then its eyes bulge out and screams.
[297:01.33]Yuck.
[297:01.45]So gross.
[297:02.09]That's horrible.
[297:04.33]Super twist.
[297:05.07]Nice.
[297:08.46]Nice one, Squire.
[297:17.46]I think he told a better last time.
[297:18.42]She's just fuming about being told not to drink that beer.
[297:21.70]She's very aware of the camera, too.
[297:23.48]I love it.
[297:24.91]She keeps doing the blink right, look right into the camera.
[297:27.57]No, no, no.
[297:27.91]No, because according to standard vessel regulation, we're all required one more beer before hitting the hay.
[297:33.20]I love that so much.
[297:34.72]It's standard issue regulatory institutional protocol subdivision 1099.
[297:39.44]See this.
[297:41.19]Where'd you read that?
[297:42.01]The internet.
[297:42.85]Oh, so you found a website that tells you to drink beer under every circumstance.
[297:46.13]I'm just following orders, ma'am.
[297:47.79]I'm into this website.
[297:49.13]10-4, good buddy.
[297:50.11]And I'm out.
[297:51.99]Okay.
[297:53.45]This is where it goes to shit.
[298:00.32]Here they come.
[298:02.12]Here come the failable QTEs.
[298:06.68]In rapid-fire succession.
[298:13.13]I feel like I wouldn't be sleeping that well on a boat in the middle of the ocean during a storm.
[298:18.23]No, no way.
[298:25.22]How would you sleep through that?
[298:26.52]They look like they're sleeping so soundly.
[298:29.72]I'm telling you, man.
[298:30.28]I don't know about you, but if I hear even the handle of the door of my bedroom turn in half an inch, I'm up ready for battle.
[298:37.23]Every time.
[298:39.01]I hear that, and I get up.
[298:39.99]I'm ready.
[298:40.27]I mean, you only hear it sometime.
[298:45.10]No, you gotta be ready.
[298:59.16]That's how you get woken up.
[299:08.79]I didn't fight this time.
[299:11.77]These people's entire motivation is money.
[299:13.95]What was the conversation that you had on top of the boat?
[299:17.70]I don't even remember, but don't take off any tape.
[299:20.26]Tell it twice.
[299:20.86]What was the conversation these people had when they rolled up next to you?
[299:26.50]Oh, they run into the buoy, and then they go, you bro, you damaged our boat!
[299:32.47]And you can be like, oh, here's some money!
[299:34.97]Conrad starts to be like, here's some money, here's 10 bucks, here's 20 bucks, loser!
[299:39.73]And then they drive off.
[299:44.50]They run into a fishing line thing, whatever it is.
[299:49.04]So they're looking for money.
[299:51.52]Well, they're... No, they're just like fishermen that are just driving along.
[299:56.54]And they've run into our shit.
[299:59.09]I'm not un-gagging anybody.
[300:08.28]It's giving me an opportunity to do it again.
[300:13.72]I'm not un-gagging anybody.
[300:19.45]gonna sit here be good and then we'll never have to go down to the ship yeah we're like just following the orders we didn't do anything wrong everybody's still taped we're not gonna be able to communicate on the top of the boat oh what
[300:54.39]You could have done that the whole time?
[300:55.40]Yeah, why did I take you long?
[300:57.64]We've been down here for like three hours.
[300:59.24]You couldn't just get this tape off my face?
[301:01.72]Wow.
[301:03.24]Anybody could have done that for anybody.
[301:05.12]Why's it gotta be me?
[301:05.95]He's like, I liked you better yesterday when you weren't even talking.
[301:19.31]Hey, so, uh, good news, bad news?
[301:21.55]Bad news?
[301:22.09]I don't see how this could get any worse.
[301:23.78]So what are we gonna do here?
[301:24.70]These are kind of... maybe the fishermen I pissed off earlier.
[301:28.00]Oh, God damn it, Conrad.
[301:29.52]Great, just great.
[301:30.98]And the good news?
[301:31.88]Ah, I recognize them.
[301:33.58]How was that good news?
[301:34.54]I thought you were gonna ask the good news first.
[301:36.24]You're such an idiot, Jesus.
[301:49.49]Choose well, I am Can go fuck yourself you piece of shit
[302:19.30]I couldn't get out.
[302:20.12]We didn't do the escape thing.
[302:25.51]We're not even gonna make an attempt.
[302:27.37]No.
[302:41.74]What's happening here?
[302:43.52]I feel like I should talk here and just talk a ton of shit.
[302:49.81]Try to talk a bunch.
[303:05.66]Slow down.
[303:07.44]Easy.
[303:11.36]Fuck you!
[303:12.16]I'm gonna kill you!
[303:23.72]We'll finish with him later.
[303:27.45]The one time I talked, I had to antagonize to make sure I got hurt.
[303:33.17]Oh yeah, I guess we do have to say something sometimes.
[303:38.31]So, we're not gonna do anything.
[303:40.81]And she's gonna just break... Unless it's an aggressive option.
[303:46.91]Only aggressive options may be picked.
[303:49.35]Yeah, aggressive only.
[304:00.21]Oh, Jesus, Conrad.
[304:03.01]They got me.
[304:04.91]Punched him right in the eye.
[304:07.26]Why didn't you tell me?
[304:09.58]What?
[304:09.76]This just happened.
[304:11.28]No, but she was in here asking me what was happening, and I didn't respond.
[304:15.82]You bastards!
[304:19.48]Hey.
[304:21.26]Dipstick.
[304:23.02]Shut the fuck up.
[304:27.43]I don't think they're going to hit her.
[304:29.35]They haven't hit Fliss.
[304:31.89]Very chivalrous pirates.
[304:40.23]Well, the climax of the story is coming up right now.
[304:46.48]Hey, are you going to untie me or are you just taking in the scenery?
[304:50.82]All right.
[304:52.64]All right.
[304:55.99]We have to get them to the next part.
[304:58.09]There's no way.
[304:58.89]He always gets lost in his own mind.
[305:00.91]Once we get Julia back, maybe we can take it to my surprise.
[305:04.99]Okay, they're coming.
[305:07.31]So we're gonna be violent here?
[305:08.45]We're gonna be violent here, I guess.
[305:09.45]Yes, be violent.
[305:14.47]Fuck.
[305:15.33]Motherfuckers.
[305:24.56]Yeah, just absolutely reckless.
[305:35.42]I got the scissors.
[305:36.18]I'm gonna stab that guy when he comes in from the door.
[305:39.60]Now we just have to wait and see what they want to do with us.
[306:00.96]So, what's the plan here?
[306:03.50]We already failed this.
[306:04.58]We failed this already.
[306:07.02]We may as well, like, actually do this one.
[306:09.73]Alright, I have to be reckless.
[306:11.47]It's like you've seen some shit.
[306:29.22]I hope I can fall off the fucking side of there.
[306:32.10]But if we fail, then they come in and we can fight them.
[306:34.60]So which one's better?
[306:35.46]Yeah, definitely fail so we can be aggressive.
[307:11.24]Two, I'm sorry.
[307:12.13]I panicked.
[307:14.89]I got really into it.
[307:16.81]Oh my god!
[307:18.91]I tried to use left thumbstick.
[307:25.70]Ow!
[307:31.14]Wait, how did we get into the stupid?
[307:33.50]It's the same situation.
[307:34.60]It's the same situation.
[307:37.40]No, you're the hostage now.
[307:41.67]What?
[307:42.69]Brad's down.
[307:49.97]Did Brad get down by running into that guy?
[307:52.51]I don't... Why don't we get to see what's going on on the boat?
[307:58.14]Wait, where are you?
[307:59.14]I'm on the ground.
[308:01.54]Oh.
[308:03.14]I see.
[308:08.50]Go for it.
[308:17.61]Oh, shit.
[308:23.29]Shooting down in a boat.
[308:25.87]Smart.
[308:31.14]Do nothing.
[308:32.72]Do nothing?
[308:33.48]The blank stare.
[308:36.56]Can you stab him?
[309:00.54]now get off our boat it's really hard to get people killed in this game see what you made us do is it the same timeline downstairs take this use it if you have to
[309:34.47]Sit down.
[309:35.97]Just take the gun.
[309:37.17]Over there.
[309:37.59]The way to get Conrad killed is you have to... I have to try to escape.
[309:41.03]Sit.
[309:42.37]Now.
[309:45.75]Stop!
[309:45.93]Damn.
[309:46.09]Maybe we can sell some of these plates or cups.
[310:04.51]I found the gold.
[310:15.84]Which one of you is going to tell me about this?
[310:19.71]Manchurian gold?
[310:24.87]No, no.
[310:26.45]Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[310:28.66]I don't think...
[310:37.13]All right, make a break for me.
[310:44.21]Okay, I mean, anything to, like, to try to get yourself hurt.
[310:46.89]You're gonna be fine, JJ.
[310:49.39]Ah.
[310:51.01]Ah.
[311:05.24]How could we have been so stupid?
[311:06.78]We're lucky it's not worse.
[311:08.86]We could have been killed.
[311:11.24]What were you thinking?
[311:14.32]I... Never mind.
[311:22.46]That's it?
[311:23.34]That's all you fucking got?
[311:24.38]Alright!
[311:25.76]Shut the fuck up!
[311:26.75]What do you got?
[311:33.71]You know what I like for you?
[311:35.81]Nothing.
[311:37.61]That's right.
[311:38.85]Nada.
[311:40.05]Complete fucking silence.
[311:43.01]Get it?
[311:43.49]By the way, I love this stream.
[311:47.23]Don't say anything.
[311:49.49]You ruined it.
[311:50.21]You're going to ruin it.
[311:50.89]Ah, you hear that?
[311:54.45]I didn't say anything.
[311:55.23]Listen to my ears.
[311:56.26]I'm being chat.
[311:57.00]He's chat.
[311:57.30]A lot of people in the house.
[311:59.68]Oh, I see.
[312:00.10]You're being chat.
[312:01.88]What?
[312:04.36]I'm good.
[312:05.44]I'm good.
[312:05.98]Don't hurt yourself.
[312:08.58]You know what I don't... Okay, if you have a game that has, like, be careful, you can die, and QTEs are in the game, but the QTEs don't do anything.
[312:16.34]What's the point of having them in the first place?
[312:18.21]They don't do anything.
[312:20.53]It's just artificial gameplay?
[312:21.33]They do, but only, like, up to four times.
[312:27.25]So are they, like, three?
[312:29.37]FYI, there's going to be a long countdown.
[312:31.75]What do you mean?
[312:33.14]Like, I have a choice to make, and it's ticking down as slow as possible.
[312:37.05]Oh.
[312:41.69]So we're gonna be here for at least another, like, maybe 120 seconds.
[312:44.01]That's alright.
[312:49.23]But I know what you're saying, like, that's why I actually liked Detroit Become Human, because at least, whatever you thought about the story, you actually, like, I lost half the cast in the game.
[313:02.18]trying not to.
[313:06.02]We did so bad the first run and everyone was fine up until the very final cutscene.
[313:12.38]I should have screamed help?
[313:19.29]He wasn't gonna kill me.
[313:22.23]There's the classic crying fan moment from earlier.
[313:30.45]and joke again wait okay yeah just cut it all luke
[313:58.57]I'm gonna help this time.
[313:59.57]Because I held on last time.
[314:04.98]What the fuck was that?
[314:05.76]I figured if I ran... I figured if I ran to help...
[314:24.99]I don't know, I just, my mind clouded over, I blinked.
[314:29.99]At least you tried.
[314:33.29]I thought if I ran that the boat was gonna hit a bump and it was gonna fuck me up.
[314:46.42]How did we find this while the ship is sinking?
[315:13.53]So at this point, we're basically like the hit new summer blockbuster movie, but this is the second evening showing where the projector boy fell asleep in the upstairs loft.
[315:23.78]Things could have been quite different.
[315:25.24]We didn't speak and we did everything wrong.
[315:37.51]Kind-hearted creature I am, I'd like to offer you some forewarning of what's... Let's hear what he's got to say.
[315:43.72]Yeah, let's get some tips.
[315:44.60]It's a good idea.
[315:49.54]Uh, yeah.
[315:51.84]Okay.
[315:52.88]You're in agreement.
[315:54.99]Clue it is...
[315:57.90]The Merchant of Venice, Act 2, Scene 7.
[316:01.54]The Prince of Morocco pulls a scroll from the eye of a skull and reads, All that glisters is not gold.
[316:10.83]Often have you heard that told.
[316:16.65]Anyway, now that you've reached a point of significance... What he's saying is Manchurian gold isn't gold.
[316:21.84]I presume you're eager to get back to your story.
[316:24.70]But here's the thing.
[316:27.12]Everything may not be entirely as it seems.
[316:31.44]Here's another weird... That's when I figured out the whole game.
[316:35.62]But what's... Why is this guy in the fucking game?
[316:38.45]Probably shouldn't have said that.
[316:40.07]You know what I mean?
[316:41.17]He's supposed to be like the guy through all the anthology games.
[316:46.23]And maybe they've got an idea where so many games down the road, you actually either play as him or play with him as an antagonist.
[316:55.84]So he's like, hey, you're getting to know, like, the eventual episode seven villain.
[317:00.86]Because everybody loved Peter Storm Aaron until dawn.
[317:07.47]But Peter Storm Aaron until dawn, no spoilers.
[317:11.61]He was like, he was a character.
[317:13.87]He was an actor in that.
[317:16.09]Never mind.
[317:16.45]He was an actor.
[317:42.01]We cannot skip any cutscene.
[317:51.46]We've tried.
[317:53.32]Oh wow, that's different.
[317:56.44]Are you failing these?
[317:57.90]There is nothing we can do.
[318:05.21]You skip the cutscene, you skip the game.
[318:07.09]That's true.
[318:15.87]Oh no, we have to walk.
[318:18.09]I was gonna say, yeah, this segment right here is pretty, uh, pretty lengthy until we get put in the room.
[318:24.33]Uh, nope.
[318:27.07]No thanks.
[318:29.75]Shit.
[318:32.49]I think maybe if we just walk in a straight line and don't stop to look at anything, it might just advance.
[318:38.34]Somebody just teleported across the screen on the left from me.
[318:46.46]I don't interact with anything, just walk in a straight line.
[318:54.74]Didn't... Didn't this dude get, like, shot in the leg?
[318:58.23]Yeah.
[318:59.21]Wouldn't you be more than limping right now?
[319:02.05]Probably.
[319:02.93]Like, not able to walk?
[319:06.49]Hold on.
[319:07.15]There is something you can do.
[319:10.73]Which character are you?
[319:12.67]I'm Juliet.
[319:14.00]Oh.
[319:14.58]Did you try this?
[319:16.78]What?
[319:19.68]Are we... Okay, we're good.
[319:21.00]We're in the room.
[319:27.07]Oh, no.
[319:27.39]What even is that?
[319:29.27]Yeah, what did the... What is... I don't know.
[319:31.57]That's a handcuff?
[319:32.71]Or... We're going so fast.
[319:40.57]We're skipping jump scares.
[319:45.48]He's the guy in the haunted house when you go with a group of friends that doesn't, just wants to get through it as fast as fucking possible.
[319:50.18]Go, go, go.
[319:51.12]I don't want to see this.
[319:52.04]Boom.
[319:52.64]The clown, the scary clown could miss the queue because your friend wants to go so damn fast.
[319:57.44]What are they going to do with us?
[320:22.22]This is just the haunted house with the friends.
[320:24.02]That's what this is.
[320:28.48]I was just becoming the monster.
[320:35.90]We made it.
[320:36.34]Actually, it was not that long.
[320:37.34]That was a full 10 straight minutes.
[320:38.99]Funny story.
[320:39.51]I just kind of sat there while you walked, knowing that you would yoink me over to the new.
[320:43.59]Oh.
[320:44.78]and I kept turning around trying to like piss off the guard enough to make him do something.
[320:49.46]Pirates are actors and they can't hurt you.
[320:51.52]That's my joke.
[321:01.52]I used that yesterday.
[321:02.32]Sorry.
[321:02.70]Did you?
[321:03.98]That's a funny joke.
[321:04.98]I got a copyright claim that one.
[321:06.61]That's a funny joke.
[321:20.29]All right, now how do we go from here?
[321:21.47]I think we just move the tables.
[321:28.73]Yeah, we just move table, leave it open.
[321:36.32]Wherever we are, it's not good.
[321:46.01]I can't believe it's taking this long for us to have something like... We can't just sit around.
[321:49.51]We need a plan.
[321:51.93]Yeah.
[321:52.87]We're not exactly in the best position to be making any moves.
[321:56.17]All right, good stuff should be coming up because they're going to hear us and break in.
[321:59.19]We just don't run.
[321:59.89]We've got to take advantage of it and get off the ship.
[322:06.51]Just don't do anything.
[322:10.01]I don't think all of us are currently strong enough to mount an escape.
[322:14.25]We cared so much about the beginning, too.
[322:16.88]We tried to, like, do, like, the double hostage.
[322:18.83]Oh, go for the gun!
[322:19.55]It don't matter.
[322:20.45]It don't matter.
[322:30.98]I got shocked.
[322:32.19]Yeah, kill all hallucinations, by the way.
[322:37.61]That's the only, it's probably the only way to kill them.
[322:41.61]I think they just really want you to be the reason why the main cast dies.
[322:45.28]Alright, so let's go to the thing in the wall.
[322:46.72]It's like in the corner, right?
[322:51.74]Hmm.
[323:09.26]Get that fucking thing open.
[323:14.33]What's going on?
[323:30.80]Uh, he has to try and fail.
[323:33.86]While we...
[323:39.47]Continue to look around the room?
[323:40.99]I don't know.
[323:48.69]We might have to trigger something here.
[323:53.18]We might, yeah.
[323:53.88]I think we have to, like, touch something.
[323:58.04]Otherwise he'll be doing that forever.
[324:00.94]Um... Oh, here we go.
[324:08.54]There's...
[324:10.28]Alex, come take a look, come on.
[324:15.96]There we go.
[324:16.35]Well, whatever I was doing was not important.
[324:28.45]So this time we're going to don't make any noise.
[324:33.37]I think we just don't make a decision to barricade.
[324:36.25]I had to make a decision to barricade or run or like hide.
[324:39.68]So just stand around.
[324:41.38]So we're just going to make a noise.
[324:44.04]I have to make that choice.
[324:45.28]See if they can get caught, I guess.
[324:53.68]Okay, then I'll take your silence as a yes.
[324:55.55]Someone should create a distraction.
[324:57.43]Oh, you're going full silence no matter what.
[324:59.15]Oh, I mean, my decision was... Even if it doesn't... Okay, barricade the door.
[325:03.51]Conrad, you do it.
[325:04.57]Nothing.
[325:06.73]We just don't want them to know what we're doing in here.
[325:12.24]So, yeah, you go over and you go like, Hey, you fucker!
[325:15.10]Hey, you stupid fucker!
[325:15.98]You dumb fucker!
[325:16.56]All right, so I can do nothing here and we can just see... Or I can go just...
[325:24.61]Raise some else so we can distract them and get the hell out of here.
[325:35.46]Hey!
[325:36.36]Yeah, you, Long John Silver and shit.
[325:38.38]What are you guys doing out there?
[325:40.12]Pieces of eight and shiver me timbers, you one-legged fuck faces.
[325:43.24]Yeah, you smarmy farmans.
[325:44.94]Yeah, no, you.
[325:45.68]I'm gonna rip your pirate parents off your shoulders and stomp them into rainbow-colored stew.
[325:50.75]Hey, hey.
[325:52.10]I'm warning you.
[325:53.40]I am an American citizen.
[325:54.90]You really want my president coming after you guys?
[325:57.00]Because he will.
[325:58.16]Each and every one of you, personally.
[326:00.44]Very, very personally.
[326:01.78]Can we just not run?
[326:05.46]Hey, can you hear me?
[326:08.40]I'm talking to you.
[326:09.88]Hello?
[326:10.60]If we go through, then I can not pull the cover back.
[326:18.42]His leap is over.
[326:20.45]Hurry up!
[326:30.94]I'll do nothing, I guess.
[326:36.44]What?
[326:43.27]Oh no!
[326:44.41]He got me!
[326:47.98]I got the one non-playable character for this next segment.
[326:52.38]Great success.
[327:00.27]Yeah, she's not in either crew.
[327:05.52]You don't play as her for a long time.
[327:07.38]What?
[327:07.56]You can't decide to go back?
[327:08.56]Now it's just so hard to kill all these people.
[327:10.40]That's the premise.
[327:28.70]Of, uh, Cabin in the Woods.
[327:30.02]Through the haunted house.
[327:53.92]That room was blinking.
[327:54.94]Please come in here.
[327:56.64]No.
[327:56.84]No.
[327:58.18]I think I'm alright.
[328:01.28]Just keep going.
[328:04.42]Why am I... How do you walk faster in this game?
[328:07.09]Left bumper.
[328:08.13]Hold it.
[328:08.63]That's what I thought, but it doesn't actually go faster.
[328:11.59]I think it's a placebo effect.
[328:12.89]But you're always faster than me.
[328:14.53]Am I?
[328:18.89]Yeah, you're way ahead of me.
[328:21.41]I am also walking as the guy who got shot in the leg.
[328:24.79]But I was still this slow the rest of the game.
[328:29.73]Because of the bullet.
[328:35.57]This is happening to me previously, though.
[328:37.73]He didn't get shot in the leg last time.
[328:40.34]I just bumped the camera.
[328:42.56]Oh, sorry.
[328:43.28]Sorry, Jerry.
[328:45.72]I'm supposed to go this way, this way, that way?
[328:46.90]Okay, sorry.
[328:50.03]Alright, that did not happen before.
[328:51.73]I didn't even see that.
[328:53.99]I was probably reading some lore.
[328:56.58]Kind of important to see that.
[328:59.62]I got yoinked last time.
[329:03.58]Like this, actually.
[329:05.08]Hi.
[329:08.19]Wasn't I shot in the head?
[329:09.01]Yes.
[329:10.39]Sort of.
[329:16.23]So you already got both these people caught and nothing happens.
[329:18.53]What happens if you just don't go down?
[329:20.14]What happens if I just don't do it?
[329:21.12]I'm just not going to do anything.
[329:22.20]I'm not going to throw any stuff down there.
[329:33.23]Oh.
[329:52.94]We should grab it.
[330:04.56]Sorry, I almost did something there.
[330:07.13]Accidentally.
[330:09.41]I actively had to try to do nothing there.
[330:11.17]I almost fucked it up.
[330:12.39]Oh my god, will you wait?
[330:23.28]the biggest problem is the whole you actually control a party of five characters gimmick because you only get to control one character for a very brief amount of time and then if you choose not to that dude's just like I don't care I'm going anyway and you didn't tell him to do that so I didn't tell him to do anything actually that's what I mean I just don't have you don't actually have any control
[330:58.04]Somebody mentioned that Until Dawn has a period where, like, the first few hours or so, the first couple hours, you can't, like, get anybody killed.
[331:05.86]The only difference, though, is this game is only, like, three hours long.
[331:09.48]Until Dawn is, like, at least, like, what, like, six, seven, eight hours?
[331:14.52]At least?
[331:16.12]Okay.
[331:17.36]So that can happen.
[331:31.21]Wait, what?
[331:33.17]When did that happen?
[331:33.81]So I have an option to throw something here.
[331:40.74]What if I just don't?
[331:43.66]If you just throw nothing?
[331:58.32]I mean, I can throw it at him.
[332:00.04]No.
[332:01.40]We haven't got to play in, like, a full, like, three minutes.
[332:05.18]Yeah, we've kind of just been watching the, uh... I think that's, like, length.
[332:15.75]I think that's the problem.
[332:17.66]Because when you got to that point, like two hours into Until Dawn, when they really, really started to get going, you had a whole game there that was still going.
[332:25.56]This is like two or three hours in.
[332:28.26]All right, and who died?
[332:29.14]End of the game.
[332:29.88]Who fucking killed that guy?
[332:31.34]You stabbed yourself in the stomach.
[332:32.50]Bye.
[332:32.96]Credits.
[332:34.54]It just kind of jumps up on you.
[332:36.36]Very, very quickly.
[332:37.26]Yeah, get out of here.
[332:38.24]They're like closing it down.
[332:40.30]I can't move.
[332:43.60]Can you move?
[332:46.81]I can... No?
[332:48.71]Yeah, can I?
[332:49.57]Who am... Okay, I'm Fliss.
[332:55.74]I'm not even touching the controller and Alex is phasing into the wall at the moment.
[333:00.22]And it's also a close up of somebody's ass.
[333:06.36]And ass is gone.
[333:07.10]All right, let's go.
[333:13.86]I can't do anything.
[333:19.64]You ready?
[333:19.96]Ready to take him out?
[333:23.26]I'm stuck in the wall.
[333:35.39]Because, like, we're going so quickly right now.
[333:38.67]We are, like, getting to the point.
[333:41.83]I'm not going anywhere.
[333:45.33]But just in general, we're, like, at that halfway point of the whole game.
[333:49.23]Let me try pausing it.
[333:55.01]What's wrong?
[333:56.59]Like, my character, there's no... I can't control anybody.
[334:00.89]There's a stationary shot.
[334:02.95]Alex is trying to become into the wall.
[334:09.80]Am I being pranked?
[334:12.12]I don't think so.
[334:12.92]It happened to me before, too.
[334:17.84]Because I... Maybe if I just get to the end of this area and you get forced into a cutscene?
[334:29.83]It's just frozen.
[334:46.70]Yeah, and then we walk this way, and then... Okay.
[334:51.93]Touch hat, touch hat.
[334:59.83]No, I can't.
[335:00.51]Sorry, chat.
[335:05.80]Okay, question.
[335:10.24]Do you think if you push start on Man of Medan...
[335:16.49]Hold on.
[335:18.17]If I press start?
[335:19.93]No, no, no, not you.
[335:20.63]Like, if you started a new game and then walked away from the controller and came back, would it be at the credits without you doing anything?
[335:29.50]I don't know.
[335:29.98]Maybe.
[335:30.78]Depends on what you mean.
[335:31.56]Like, the computer will do it for you?
[335:33.82]Like, will they force you through each segment of the story after a certain amount of time without you having to physically touch the controller?
[335:43.15]It's possible because there is a movie version of the game.
[335:46.84]You know, it's shared movie experience, so I have to imagine that it's built into the game somehow.
[335:54.06]I'm telling you, if I'm a ghost, I ain't fucking sticking around.
[335:59.32]You know what I mean?
[336:01.73]I'm gonna be going on a ghost vacation.
[336:20.30]I remember that.
[336:21.52]I remember when I did that.
[336:23.18]We're about 67% of the way through the game.
[336:27.28]Because it was at that point that I... What was that?
[336:30.81]Even better the second time around.
[336:47.99]Okay, this is where he goes.
[336:49.13]No!
[336:49.27]You alright, dude?
[337:07.69]Look out!
[337:10.81]Shoot, and it's right around the corner!
[337:12.15]I'm gonna get it!
[337:22.31]Alright.
[337:27.75]Let's go.
[337:32.71]It's time for someone to die.
[337:36.05]Is it gonna be me, or is it gonna be Italics?
[337:38.10]That's the question.
[337:39.28]I am actively gonna try to kill Italics.
[337:43.94]That's right, Italics is still stuck.
[337:48.84]Hold on, you're still stuck?
[337:54.21]Yeah.
[337:55.75]Somebody in chat said that the only way that they could fix it is by re-inviting someone to their game.
[338:02.96]That's why I was asking, hey, if you didn't do anything, do you think the game would complete itself?
[338:06.72]Because I was wondering if you would just by yourself able to advance the law.
[338:11.76]You're definitely going to have to be pulled in here soon.
[338:14.42]I'm like almost at the point where you have to be.
[338:16.79]Well, I'm at the very beginning of when we took control.
[338:19.97]And you're just standing there?
[338:22.15]If you look closely on my screen on the left side, you can see the calves of Alex walking into the wall over and over again.
[338:31.87]I'm curious of what happens here then.
[338:35.36]I also did this at a portion of the actual playthrough.
[338:40.38]And you did yoink me to the next scene.
[338:42.02]It was very abrupt.
[338:43.22]Well, let's see what happens.
[338:44.42]That's about to happen.
[338:49.21]There we go.
[338:53.75]This part here.
[338:55.72]Look.
[338:56.18]Oh, what's that?
[338:57.02]Oh, no.
[338:57.40]There's something here.
[339:03.58]So, funny story.
[339:04.70]We've already missed, despite trying our best, two guaranteed opportunities to kill a character.
[339:11.48]What are they?
[339:13.60]The first one is drink the beer after the decompression, and I was silent on the beer.
[339:20.57]So I did not drink it.
[339:21.79]She also doesn't die until the end of the game, if you do that.
[339:25.19]What do you mean, drink the beer?
[339:26.45]Who would do that, though?
[339:28.41]First of all, you'd be reckless to swim up to the surface without decompressing.
[339:32.07]And second, they give you like a public service announcement sponsored by the government.
[339:37.48]about why you shouldn't drink beer because they probably didn't want someone to watch this game and it's like a don't try this at home moment so but what what what's in the beer uh well the beer reacts with the um the bins or whatever that you get from decompression she just dies if you get the bins and you drink beer
[340:05.52]You're just basically gonna die eventually.
[340:08.60]Just don't do it.
[340:09.88]Alright, well... I'm currently being choked.
[340:17.37]The second way is... You know when they do the thunder window escape?
[340:22.19]You actually have to succeed at opening the window.
[340:31.77]So Conrad can die on the boat.
[340:38.08]I'll just talk.
[340:41.72]The best part about this is you explaining the scenes.
[340:46.46]Oh, fuck off, game.
[340:47.77]I have no idea what you're doing.
[340:49.43]Fuck this game.
[340:52.77]I mean, you don't have to tell me twice.
[340:55.33]I'm stuck here.
[341:36.74]Failed the second QTE, that zombie grabbed me, and then I get my face pulled into the ground.
[341:42.90]And then third attempt for a QTE, zombie comes out of the ground, and grabs my face, like, I'm gonna break your neck, like, I'm literally murdering you.
[341:53.03]Last chance for a QTE, like, he does like a, ah, you're dead thing, and then goes to black and shows her lying on the ground, and then it cuts back up from black, and I go, ah, ah.
[342:04.01]It was like three or four QTs that I failed, and I was like dead on the ground.
[342:07.61]Yeah, I failed four underwater with no oxygen mask.
[342:12.01]We're live.
[342:12.42]And the zombies aren't real, though.
[342:13.74]That's true.
[342:16.78]They are an illusion.
[342:23.16]That is true.
[342:23.60]That is an illusion.
[342:24.28]All right.
[342:24.72]Are you back?
[342:26.05]Yeah.
[342:27.27]All right, guys.
[342:27.73]Welcome back.
[342:28.27]For now.
[342:29.07]Here we go.
[342:29.71]Are you ready?
[342:31.80]Here's a decision to make.
[342:32.42]Yeah, there's some compelling gameplay going on over here.
[342:37.94]Uh... Walking in a different direction.
[342:47.47]No!
[342:48.35]No!
[342:49.15]No!
[342:50.73]How you doing?
[343:01.79]Oh, I'm chilling.
[343:02.95]You're still stuck?
[343:04.77]Yeah, no, I'm good.
[343:06.43]How the hell does this play out, then?
[343:09.03]I don't know, but I ain't moving.
[343:12.50]Because this is a new... Are you still Alex?
[343:14.50]It's me and Julia.
[343:16.82]You're still Alex.
[343:17.32]Alex and Julia are here.
[343:18.64]I don't... Yeah, Alex... I'm supposed to be Alex, but Alex is walking into the wall.
[343:25.39]He's just going, man.
[343:29.55]So, what...
[343:33.88]So, who's gonna try to come after me?
[343:38.62]I'm curious how this is gonna work, because you... Well, Brad's gone, so wherever Brad is, he's off on his own.
[343:48.87]You should have been yoinked by now.
[343:50.91]Are you just playing the game against the AI?
[343:53.91]I mean, technically, you're supposed to come in now, right?
[343:59.91]Um...
[344:01.77]I don't know.
[344:02.31]But I do know that Conrad can die on the boat if you fail the right QTE.
[344:07.15]Stick to the script, okay.
[344:07.99]Alright, I'm going to stick to the script.
[344:19.02]It's like hard to die in this game.
[344:20.64]I'm like reading all the ways to kill people and it's like a challenge.
[344:24.82]I feel like I'm looking up the achievement guide.
[344:28.80]Don't go outside.
[344:29.70]Why not?
[344:33.93]I got bad news.
[344:34.67]Do you have any spoiler for you?
[344:38.91]The next opportunity for a character to die is not until we get to play as Fliss.
[344:44.41]I mean, I am Fliss.
[344:46.21]Oh.
[344:46.81]Yeah.
[344:48.43]Maybe that's what I didn't know.
[344:49.65]Don't go outside?
[344:51.25]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't go outside.
[344:53.33]Why not?
[344:58.01]Don't go outside.
[344:58.73]Go to the door.
[344:59.25]What do you mean don't go outside?
[345:03.31]I'm trying to pull him into the game.
[345:06.32]Oops.
[345:07.28]Someone said pause and unpause, but that didn't change.
[345:10.40]Or disconnect my controller.
[345:14.90]Just fuck around for a while.
[345:16.56]What?
[345:23.64]Don't do it.
[345:25.58]Don't go outside.
[345:26.30]What do you mean I can die if I go out there?
[345:30.43]Isn't that the point?
[345:43.55]So what the fuck do you want me to do?
[345:48.73]You won't die if you go outside.
[345:50.35]Alright, so what do you mean stay?
[345:53.93]What if I stay inside?
[345:57.24]But then how am I going to pull italics into the game?
[346:03.84]I feel like I've been streaming for 14 hours.
[346:05.76]You know what I mean?
[346:09.53]I finally got pulled.
[346:12.03]Thank God.
[346:15.22]And, like, Twitch's servers are, like, getting shit on.
[346:18.12]That's what I mean.
[346:18.86]I'm just going outside.
[346:25.73]I'm going for it.
[346:28.29]I finally get to play.
[346:30.57]Talix has to play.
[346:31.45]I am playing.
[346:35.44]Just now.
[346:42.44]I'm in the room with the poison.
[346:43.64]Yeah, but doesn't he need to come up here?
[346:50.98]Remember this?
[346:51.94]Alright, do I... Do I have anything I can do?
[346:54.18]Alright, do the, um... Do, uh, the McDonald's menu tier list.
[347:03.81]Hang on, I finally get to be Brad.
[347:06.51]And see what was supposed to happen the first time.
[347:09.49]What?
[347:12.72]This is where I went AFK in the original playthrough, and I want to know how... This is new content.
[347:19.47]Never-before-seen DLC of Brad.
[347:29.89]Eat the berries.
[347:30.89]Eat the berries.
[347:34.91]There are no berries here.
[347:43.40]Hey, are you Brad?
[347:44.14]I am Brad.
[347:48.50]Remember when you were like, hey, are you Brad?
[347:50.68]That was so funny.
[347:52.44]It was, though.
[347:53.56]It was pretty funny.
[347:56.02]Everyone was so mad.
[347:57.30]Wait, are you Fliss right now?
[348:09.35]Yes.
[348:10.55]Did you just silence treatment me?
[348:13.04]In the game?
[348:14.20]Yeah.
[348:16.06]Huh?
[348:18.14]What are you talking about?
[348:19.11]You didn't just talk to Brad?
[348:24.55]Oh, I didn't get to see this last time.
[348:28.01]This part actually would have been cool.
[348:33.44]See, you would have asked me that same question.
[348:35.72]You see, chat?
[348:37.35]He just asked that question.
[348:38.73]But I already know how it goes down.
[348:40.65]Yeah, but if you didn't know how it went down and you were like, hey, you fool.
[348:43.97]And we're playing it like on purpose.
[348:46.27]Listen, here's the facts are.
[348:48.07]I didn't know.
[348:50.49]At this point in the game, I didn't know that it was just not a monster.
[348:54.23]By the way, I'm actually real human.
[348:56.45]I just thought you had come into control of the monsters and we're playing as the bad guys now.
[349:01.57]Oh.
[349:02.42]I thought that would have been a cool way to do it where one of the players gets infected by the mist and you're now the antagonist trying to like dungeon master the other person's game.
[349:14.31]Guys, I can't eat any fucking food.
[349:16.25]What are you talking about?
[349:18.03]Food?
[349:18.43]I can't eat the food on the table.
[349:22.16]It doesn't have a glowy thing on it.
[349:25.64]This food cart.
[349:26.56]What do you want me to eat?
[349:33.44]All right, so I think it actually turns out I picked the right point to go AFK, because I don't think anything happens in here.
[349:39.41]I think this is just... Oh, wait, maybe it does.
[349:45.31]I think I have to spin the bullet.
[349:51.35]What are you doing?
[349:52.89]No, not you, like this.
[350:06.34]There's another food cart.
[350:09.08]There's no food carts.
[350:21.80]Oh.
[350:22.94]Wait, what?
[350:24.44]I still don't understand.
[350:27.70]And I'm here for it this time.
[350:35.49]Jolly Jack.
[350:37.39]Actually, this made me more confused.
[350:44.04]It's really kind of annoying that they have to replace that every day.
[350:53.99]I mean, that's a cool gimmick, but somebody has to replace all that every day.
[350:58.79]For a quarter?
[351:00.39]Oof.
[351:02.73]Actual nightmare.
[351:19.80]There's no berries, guys.
[351:32.93]You guys are fucking with me.
[351:39.51]There's a food cart with thousands of berries on it.
[351:44.28]You are full of shit.
[351:58.67]Back left of the room?
[352:09.52]North left?
[352:17.37]Left.
[352:18.43]What direction do you think I'm walking at the moment?
[352:41.80]Oh, it was all just a dream.
[352:43.19]How do I do this?
[352:45.57]You went AFK during the looping dream segment.
[352:48.91]Is that what you did?
[352:50.35]Yeah.
[352:51.55]That's so funny.
[352:52.79]This is the part that I missed before.
[352:58.85]And this is what it transitioned into, I think.
[353:01.75]So then do I just have to wait for you to get up here?
[353:13.49]Probably because that's what yoinked me.
[353:15.86]I mean, I did the thing I was supposed to do this time and it didn't have nothing different happen.
[353:19.70]So now I'm gonna open the door.
[353:21.80]Yeah, now I have to kill you.
[353:23.58]Yes.
[353:27.37]So now I have to just like leave.
[353:33.43]Okay, here we go.
[353:34.99]I think I ended up jumping off here anyways.
[353:39.13]I just did it myself, instead of make you scare me into jumping.
[353:47.16]Which is a nice speedrun tactic.
[353:51.30]Okay, so... Alright, that's you.
[353:57.17]What was that close-up?
[353:59.23]Except you're like a Zambie.
[354:03.27]With a fist bump.
[354:18.20]Wait, you didn't look like this before.
[354:21.91]What?
[354:26.91]What just happened?
[354:28.05]You didn't look like that before.
[354:29.88]Did you just mess it up?
[354:32.14]No, what?
[354:36.02]I didn't even get a chance.
[354:38.58]It's... Because I stayed in the room.
[354:46.67]Wow, it's really hard to kill people in this game.
[354:51.47]Neither of you found a weapon?
[354:56.04]So I didn't find a weapon, so I couldn't kill you.
[355:07.35]It seems like speedrunning is the best way.
[355:09.19]Like, fail everything, don't talk.
[355:11.55]Keep going and you just will win.
[355:13.45]Except maybe you won't save the boat.
[355:15.14]I killed this person.
[355:33.06]We're just playing it perfectly again.
[355:36.68]We're just doing it again.
[355:46.32]I got up to like, yeah, you better run.
[355:49.36]All right, I'm gonna encourage him this time.
[356:18.84]Do it!
[356:19.76]Do it!
[356:20.42]Do it!
[356:21.52]Do it!
[356:21.94]Do it!
[356:22.38]Do it!
[356:23.02]Come on.
[356:33.33]I'm not convinced that he's dead.
[356:35.71]He's not.
[356:36.11]He wakes up at the end of the game.
[356:39.74]Nothing changes.
[356:40.98]The only character that died last playthrough is that character.
[357:00.30]It's the same run, nothing changed.
[357:01.90]No, nothing has changed so far.
[357:04.54]Somehow we're making the same choices.
[357:12.49]Although technically everyone did drown.
[357:15.41]We're just playing the game again, a second time through.
[357:18.47]Yeah, I know!
[357:20.77]We just liked it so much we played it twice for the people that couldn't make it to the first showing of the stream.
[357:26.61]This is just a Twitch rerun.
[357:36.56]We're watching our own stream again and reacting to it.
[357:39.32]Yeah, we're just re-watching the stream.
[357:41.79]Okay, can he kill us?
[357:53.39]If we make a bunch of noise... No, he's an actor.
[358:05.61]Who's he talking to?
[358:09.31]So this is the Conrad thing.
[358:17.14]So this is... this wasn't in the last... So if you want to feel free to pull the old plug...
[358:22.45]So, am I the player that has to run away from you both times in a row?
[358:28.61]Are you doing this right now?
[358:30.63]Are you, like, invisible person?
[358:35.00]And then I start running?
[358:44.39]You mentioned this.
[358:45.05]I know like the hey are you Brad is the meme of this stream.
[358:48.45]But if we were on the couch playing this together, how the fuck would this play out?
[358:53.05]Did Star just join the call?
[359:00.26]No?
[359:00.36]What?
[359:00.60]Whatever the hell is going on, it can't be good.
[359:04.36]That sounded like a... That definitely sounded like a, you know... If all of us were on the couch?
[359:13.62]We should test it out.
[359:14.60]Let's go plug this in and go on the couch.
[359:17.20]Play through number three.
[359:27.62]Where is the weapon?
[359:30.22]I have to have a weapon or else no one's going to die in this run.
[359:34.26]Can't go that way.
[359:37.94]I don't know where the weapon is.
[359:46.80]There was no reason for him to be going insane the first playthrough.
[359:51.05]He hadn't even seen anything scary.
[359:53.23]But what happens... So the game just doesn't want the two people to really be in communication with each other?
[359:58.98]Because obviously it's going to be... I guess that's the whole point is like play co-op but don't talk to the other person.
[360:03.40]Because then it's like, oh, hey, dude, are you like on the stairs?
[360:06.88]No.
[360:07.16]That's why...
[360:08.78]A way out was so fun because you had to communicate until the end of the game.
[360:14.37]And then it was like, alright, let's not talk to each other because it's obvious we're not supposed to.
[360:21.99]And then the game was over.
[360:23.14]It's meant to be played online with strangers?
[360:24.90]There's an invite button.
[360:27.80]And don't play alone.
[360:29.28]To your friends list.
[360:35.63]What the fuck am I doing?
[360:37.55]I, like, lost all track.
[360:47.84]Is there a puzzle here?
[360:49.94]Oh, right, I gotta get the... Ah, I forgot the key.
[360:54.45]I think I have you trapped, because I have the key.
[360:57.05]Where there's a key... There's a lock.
[361:06.30]This I have to do something no I do because I'm like I'm holding you back I Knew that but besides that guys are doing beer There's no berries on the desk
[361:34.17]So you really are supposed to be like, hey, man, you want to play Man of Medan?
[361:37.97]Yeah.
[361:38.69]Oh, yeah.
[361:38.95]There's like a co-op mode.
[361:39.95]It's cool.
[361:41.13]Okay.
[361:42.03]I'll talk to you in like four hours.
[361:45.47]Not that many.
[361:50.86]Four is being very generous.
[361:52.44]That is true.
[361:52.88]All right.
[361:54.38]So I got the thing.
[361:55.30]And now I have to forget like the progression here.
[362:01.04]I can't leave from here.
[362:04.30]I'm not sure if there's a moment in the game where you're waiting on me.
[362:08.34]Am I?
[362:08.60]Because I'm just kind of existing in this room.
[362:26.23]Okay.
[362:30.37]You eating a gogurt?
[362:32.07]That's what it looked like.
[362:39.74]Oh, where's the candle?
[362:41.87]Am I waiting for you?
[362:43.63]Oh, the game showed me because I'm too dumb.
[362:45.29]Now you're waiting for me.
[362:46.47]Oh, okay.
[362:49.85]I'm waiting for you to get a candle?
[362:56.15]And it has to spook me.
[363:06.22]What can I do here?
[363:06.74]Can I look at this?
[363:18.61]There ain't nothing on here.
[363:26.52]Berries spotted.
[363:27.54]I think if you play this in... What happens if I fail this QTE?
[363:32.87]Fail it.
[363:36.01]Ah!
[363:37.93]Was that me running after me into a room with me?
[363:46.75]right okay so we're currently uh there you are why are you so sexy though you found me you found me good work
[364:12.23]So what's happening on your side?
[364:13.47]Are you just whispering in my ear?
[364:14.97]No, I'm just standing completely still.
[364:18.66]And you're scared of me.
[364:21.88]But you're not standing completely still for me.
[364:25.68]Just kill me.
[364:29.76]Bart, get over here.
[364:30.50]Don't!
[364:45.17]Why won't I get up?
[364:46.97]It's just... What's going on?
[364:50.57]It's just cut, because it's like, hey, you failed too many times.
[364:54.06]So we gotta just throw you in the... This is so... This is so funny.
[365:06.20]Ha ha ha.
[365:11.99]Did I trap your hand in the door?
[365:13.65]No.
[365:13.99]Well, then what stopped the door?
[365:19.13]You closed it.
[365:20.00]You closed the door.
[365:21.76]Yeah, but your hand was in it.
[365:23.16]Somebody's hand was in it.
[365:26.68]Oh, my God.
[365:28.65]That was a fucking mess.
[365:37.17]The game is having trouble trying to figure out what to do because we're doing this so fucking wrong.
[365:45.25]What?
[365:47.09]Did you just teleport?
[365:48.09]I just saw... What is happening?
[365:51.32]Did I just go in...
[366:07.98]Did you finally see the cutscene?
[366:10.56]No.
[366:12.02]I guess the cutscene was amazing.
[366:14.58]I looked down and you were just lying on your back.
[366:19.44]You should see the fall.
[366:22.45]The fall was good.
[366:24.25]Oh, my stomach.
[366:25.57]I got first character kill.
[366:27.67]I... Oh my god.
[366:37.20]Alright, here we go.
[366:38.70]Part 2.
[366:40.32]First Blood.
[366:40.88]Through here, quick!
[367:06.74]Can you help me up?
[367:08.08]You're like crying.
[367:10.04]Can you help me?
[367:10.94]What was the point of that?
[367:12.06]I didn't even... I didn't choose anything, and I just helped you up anyway.
[367:26.03]Run or jump?
[367:26.95]Or nothing?
[367:27.57]Uh, neither.
[367:31.27]Is he gone yet?
[367:35.53]Did he just leave?
[367:36.51]Nope.
[367:39.67]Looks like we're jumping.
[367:40.75]Hey, can you help me up again?
[367:44.39]Never mind, looks like we're both down.
[367:49.79]To be fair, this is accurate to most horror movies, though.
[367:53.07]Yeah, but failing every QTE is so difficult.
[367:57.41]All he did was shove you down?
[367:59.41]I thought they had a knife?
[368:01.29]Where's his knife?
[368:03.72]He just, like, checked you.
[368:08.39]What?
[368:09.91]He was in the room with us.
[368:13.07]He walked inside of the room with us.
[368:15.03]Yeah, it's me.
[368:21.01]Come on, let's go.
[368:30.50]They played the stair cutscene twice.
[368:32.52]Alright, can they start dropping like flies here?
[368:47.37]Let's see.
[368:53.25]Imagine playing a horror game and you have to google how to die.
[368:57.17]I know, right?
[369:02.97]Three people could be dead right now.
[369:04.17]How could you fuck this up so badly?
[369:05.77]We've failed every QTE and made every horrible decision.
[369:13.08]Including not making decisions.
[369:16.39]Things appear to have taken a turn towards the spiritual, wouldn't you say?
[369:21.34]I think this game just rewards an indecisive characteristic.
[369:26.72]If you just don't ever make any choices in your own life, everything will work itself out.
[369:32.37]I was really hoping there was going to be a bottle of alcohol in this book.
[369:35.41]He, or rather you, should have been a bit less careless.
[369:43.49]Have you figured out what's going on?
[369:45.67]How to stop it?
[369:46.94]How to save the lives of your poor, unfortunate stowaways?
[369:50.54]The poor, unfortunate stowaways are chat at this point.
[369:54.44]We're trying to save their lives by getting everyone killed.
[369:59.38]Quite a lot of deaths that night.
[370:04.22]Let me help you out.
[370:05.63]Give you a little hint.
[370:06.87]Please.
[370:09.82]I still don't understand what's happening.
[370:12.44]Are we looking for gold still?
[370:13.90]Gold bars?
[370:16.72]Who's the monster?
[370:18.20]Wait, what?
[370:20.66]Are you actually confused?
[370:23.02]Are you imitating chat?
[370:26.04]I'm asking if it's still gold.
[370:29.18]I don't understand.
[370:29.90]I need the hint.
[370:32.13]Supernatural?
[370:35.79]Perhaps you've started to realize something.
[370:41.74]Perhaps you're starting to realize Betty's.
[370:44.32]Almost like the developer didn't trust you.
[370:49.57]So they add this guy to make sure you know three times.
[370:54.29]It's like very on the nose.
[371:11.03]Everything's a lie.
[371:12.27]Everything's a lie Okay, I Cannot I'm you know what I'm gonna be real with you.
[371:18.53]I really can't fucking believe It's the only way we can explain that we have done this whole thing again.
[371:23.69]I thought it was gonna be like Five people die in the boat or something Only one person per chapter can die because you have to code all those outcomes I
[371:38.97]Yeah, but just for a second, I tried to catch up and he was gone.
[371:41.19]You can only die when you're allowed to die.
[371:43.73]Why?
[371:44.17]This just doesn't add up.
[371:51.22]Shouldn't switch characters.
[371:52.64]I think there's a common misconception that if a character lives or dies, that's the only indicator of a choices matter game.
[372:01.48]The real thing is we're not even making choices.
[372:07.36]You know what I'm saying?
[372:08.13]Like we haven't chosen to do anything.
[372:13.67]So I don't care if they haven't died by now.
[372:15.07]I care because we didn't play.
[372:15.77]That's funny.
[372:16.67]You chose not to play the game.
[372:17.67]That's true.
[372:18.07]I'm talking about the first playthrough.
[372:20.31]That's true.
[372:20.63]There's never like two paths.
[372:22.05]Which one do you want to do?
[372:43.96]doesn't that actually they all lead to the same thing now alex wasn't the only alex what are you talking about there were things walking around with his face on them alex's face and he was oh it's horrifying faces alex is so ugly what the why did you say that about me sorry I'm just parroting the last stream this is the second stream maybe like one thing could but not all of these crazy things it's too much of a coincidence
[373:15.16]There's got to be something going on here.
[373:17.64]What can we absolutely be sure about?
[373:20.06]What do we know that's real?
[373:28.01]We're wasting time.
[373:29.49]Whatever we do, we have to do it now.
[373:31.69]Time to get off this ship.
[373:33.41]We're not going anywhere without the distributor cap.
[373:35.99]The Duke needs it to run.
[373:37.35]What's the next stream?
[373:38.07]Tomorrow.
[373:39.77]This ship's got to have a radio.
[373:41.81]Oh, I don't even want to do it.
[373:42.83]If we can find it and use it...
[373:45.58]Streaming tomorrow.
[373:56.23]So we have to go through this again.
[374:01.31]Is there, like, a way?
[374:02.85]Can I just, like... The speedrun's going pretty good so far, though.
[374:09.94]The speedrun is going really good so far.
[374:14.08]We might set a new world first.
[374:23.66]Why are they doing this again?
[374:24.68]I just got here.
[374:27.19]We just got here.
[374:27.89]How do you know we're doing it again?
[374:29.17]Uh oh.
[374:42.98]Find the radio.
[374:53.74]It's around here.
[374:57.34]Just follow me.
[374:58.40]I know where it is.
[374:59.02]Upper.
[375:07.16]I did the same thing last time.
[375:10.57]What did you do?
[375:11.87]Right?
[375:12.11]Did I?
[375:12.83]I did the same thing?
[375:14.75]I leaned over on the side of the chair and... Like, got hurt again.
[375:19.93]Like, I moved too far over to my right.
[375:21.63]Why?
[375:22.31]Did I do that twice?
[375:26.95]This is freaking me out.
[375:27.69]This is actually getting in my head.
[375:28.75]I'll pull you up.
[375:30.69]Um... Is there some gas coming in that I need to be aware of?
[375:34.55]I... It's... Maybe it's the amount of time that we've been in the game.
[375:37.86]I leaned over on the right.
[375:39.78]And if I lean too hard, my, um...
[375:43.86]My right armrest will move, and it kind of catches me sometimes, and I like hurt my, like, oh, ah, like my fucking elbow.
[375:52.39]Someone is teleporting.
[375:59.91]Do it quick.
[376:00.43]Do a deep sniff.
[376:08.84]This is... This is where I chased comrades before.
[376:13.54]yeah okay we're almost at the end of the game over here we do the radio and then that's like the final scene gotta wait through here
[376:40.23]Um, like, the way we've been playing has been making the characters glitch around my game.
[376:47.21]Oh, I'm certain of it.
[376:50.69]Because I'm hosting this, right?
[376:53.97]So that means that you're... I'm, like, dumping data into your computer's brain.
[376:59.43]And it can't take it.
[377:01.88]Because all these things are happening too quickly.
[377:07.50]Loading in.
[377:13.29]Okay, let's go find the radio.
[377:15.79]Should I scream?
[377:16.81]Should I just say nothing?
[377:20.26]Say nothing to the radio.
[377:22.88]Where is it?
[377:23.16]It's in here, right?
[377:28.89]What are you doing?
[377:31.95]What is my character doing?
[377:37.45]Scream?
[377:38.03]No, I'm gonna...
[377:40.51]No, I'm not going to say anything because that tells them that there's people here.
[377:42.83]Maybe they won't show up at the end.
[377:50.42]Where's this damn radio?
[377:55.38]Find a radio yet?
[377:57.32]I remember that.
[377:57.76]No, but there's got to be a radio on this ship.
[377:59.84]There has to be.
[378:04.29]I'm not exactly confident about our chances of survival at this point.
[378:10.51]Radio is back here, right?
[378:12.19]Yeah.
[378:13.45]And then it's... Mayday.
[378:15.01]Mayday.
[378:18.22]Do you think it's easier to navigate your character in this game or Resident Evil 1 on original console?
[378:24.72]That's Tulsa.
[378:25.22]No freaking way.
[378:27.32]This thing actually still works?
[378:35.12]Wait.
[378:35.38]I'm doing this this time?
[378:36.60]Apparently.
[378:38.58]Good old shortwave radio.
[378:42.87]Resident Evil 1.
[378:44.21]It's a number station.
[378:47.77]Military bandit.
[378:50.53]Let's ask them for help.
[378:52.66]Yeah, we don't know the name of the ship.
[378:54.48]Therefore, we're not given... Come in, please.
[378:57.02]Do you read us?
[378:58.82]Over.
[379:05.84]Uh, okay.
[379:07.18]At least there's someone listening.
[379:08.22]Uh, the signal's in and out, though.
[379:09.98]Uh... Fliss, that was our only chance!
[379:26.53]What's wrong with you?
[379:27.43]Imagine being kidnapped, abducted, held hostage, torn onto a ghost boat against your will.
[379:35.01]You get a working radio.
[379:36.63]You say nothing.
[379:38.13]No, at that point, that's when one of the characters just starts laughing.
[379:40.50]Like... I can't believe it.
[379:41.52]Unbelievable.
[379:42.28]What else can go wrong today?
[379:43.44]Obviously.
[379:43.72]I can do this.
[379:44.78]I should be the one to go.
[379:45.96]No clowns in this game either.
[379:57.83]Except for all the main characters, but... Just kidding.
[380:03.69]Actors, I like you.
[380:06.43]It's not your fault.
[380:15.88]We did the same- We got the same outcome.
[380:20.10]Fuck.
[380:20.92]We should've said, let me go.
[380:24.40]We've done the same outcome.
[380:25.82]The same thing.
[380:30.15]The same run.
[380:31.89]The only thing that changed is you T-posed on the ground.
[380:35.37]We are.
[380:36.24]We're doomed to repeat history.
[380:41.56]Oh, we have to try to get shot by that guy, right?
[380:53.75]Keep telling him that there's no mist.
[380:55.63]Just be like, what are you talking about?
[380:56.65]I see the mist.
[380:57.97]There is no mist.
[381:04.88]What are we gonna do?
[381:15.48]He thinks we're like dead.
[381:17.24]We're just embarrassed, okay?
[381:18.77]Gosh.
[381:20.39]I can't believe we just said it with such confidence and gusto that we were gonna be the ones to jump down there and then we just... I don't know, guys.
[381:27.67]I was expecting a different outcome.
[381:30.27]Hey.
[381:31.33]That's so stupid.
[381:36.23]bubbles after you okay straight forward forward left hug the corners save time okay uh you your camera your cameras I still see you that's me what that's me I thought that I was brad eat the food on the cart
[382:10.49]You missed the food.
[382:11.03]Go back.
[382:15.47]Hey, are you Brad?
[382:16.97]You missed this food that you missed on the cart.
[382:20.21]You should have gold on table.
[382:21.96]No, food on cart.
[382:25.78]It's different.
[382:31.46]Good place to find a generator, right?
[382:40.01]You know what I love a movie so much?
[382:52.41]in the theater and you're out of the sea so good that was the best movie I've ever seen in my life let's go watch it again right now let's get in there and watch it right now you go to the next show and you meet oh god what's up that it was why are we doing this we didn't like this movie are you hearing my jokes like on a delay what okay okay I that when we first started it I I said that
[383:17.35]You're not.
[383:18.07]Yeah, I think we're all going crazy.
[383:19.53]You did?
[383:19.69]Yeah.
[383:19.83]I think it might be from that fog.
[383:22.39]Why would the fog make us go crazy?
[383:24.17]Were you muted?
[383:24.73]The fog?
[383:25.91]No.
[383:25.97]It's fucking with our heads.
[383:27.79]I said, uh, hey, projector boy, I fell asleep, and he forgot to run the audio, so we're all being silent.
[383:35.21]But we're seeing seconds showing in the evening.
[383:37.93]Maybe they make contact?
[383:38.85]When did you say it?
[383:39.42]It's a theory, I guess.
[383:42.10]Oh, God.
[383:43.88]All right, let's get going.
[383:46.55]That's not the same joke.
[383:49.11]They both take place in a movie theater.
[383:51.85]I said it's like when a big movie opens and there's a second evening showing.
[384:00.90]That's basically the same thing.
[384:06.22]Except in this one we're being silent.
[384:08.24]Well, get fucking plagiarized.
[384:12.00]Does that mean that I wasn't listening to you?
[384:19.99]Can you walk forward?
[384:26.81]I don't know where I'm going.
[384:32.94]Please move your character.
[384:34.36]Look.
[384:41.12]Look at this.
[384:42.68]Oh, hey.
[384:43.90]It's the rebreather.
[384:46.26]The fisherman must have brought it over from the Duke of Milan.
[384:48.73]You think it still works?
[384:50.27]Looks like it's got a little juice left.
[384:51.91]Maybe a couple of minutes?
[384:53.41]Should we bring it with us?
[384:54.27]I mean, it's heavy.
[384:54.89]I don't even know what you decided there.
[385:07.48]All right, this is important, this is important.
[385:11.42]Get shot.
[385:12.00]Get shot.
[385:20.70]It's the mist.
[385:21.30]The mist is doing it.
[385:52.19]Yeah, we have to tell him that we have been breathing this mist all day.
[385:57.15]Just be like, oh, yeah, we've been breathing it in.
[385:59.63]We breathe it in every day.
[386:06.31]I think we messed it up pretty bad last time.
[386:07.85]I don't know how to do it any worse.
[386:13.54]The way to do it is to keep saying that you've breathed in the mist.
[386:18.40]So, like, actually have to try.
[386:19.82]Yeah.
[386:27.49]Why would he scream at us?
[386:31.46]Keep saying that there is no mist.
[386:37.32]Okay, so we have to keep telling this guy that there's no mist.
[386:44.86]What's the problem with sharing all that, dude?
[386:47.74]There must be plenty of that to go around.
[386:49.88]More than enough.
[386:51.46]And we're all in this together, right?
[386:54.14]Trying to cut me out of the deed?
[387:05.72]Oh, no, he didn't say the line.
[387:07.62]It's like Scooby Doo.
[387:16.38]Lock it!
[387:17.50]Oh, my God, lock it!
[387:21.22]Okay.
[387:22.30]Are we safe?
[387:27.22]Please tell me we're safe.
[387:30.30]Yeah, totally.
[387:30.88]I mean, these doors are bent to withstand all sorts of...
[387:36.24]Okay, so we have to say the mist is fake.
[387:46.18]You're stupid.
[387:46.68]The mist is not real.
[387:47.96]There's no mist.
[388:03.76]Say you breathed it in and then say it's not real.
[388:05.70]No changing.
[388:06.20]None of that.
[388:08.10]Raise your hands up.
[388:09.71]Slow.
[388:12.81]No, no.
[388:13.85]Not like that.
[388:15.48]I said no changing.
[388:23.46]Just put the gun down.
[388:26.10]Nobody has to get hurt.
[388:27.63]I bet being completely silent here is the optimal.
[388:31.09]I didn't get a choice in this, did I?
[388:33.41]We have to tell them that there's no such thing as a mist.
[388:37.27]I picked the worst option.
[388:41.15]Not again!
[388:42.65]It's all gone changing on me!
[388:44.68]What's changing?
[388:46.88]Stay away!
[388:48.72]Stay back from the mist.
[388:50.50]What?
[388:50.70]There's no mist, man.
[388:53.20]What did you just say?
[388:54.82]Don't breathe the mist.
[389:00.05]What mist?
[389:04.63]What's going on?
[389:05.07]Is this me?
[389:06.39]Dude, what mist?
[389:07.71]That was you, yeah.
[389:09.69]I couldn't control it.
[389:10.21]You must have seen it.
[389:11.21]It's everywhere.
[389:12.77]Yellow, creeping everywhere.
[389:16.13]It's inside now.
[389:18.49]inside with us now please just calm down stop stop it's in one of us isn't it which one do I do I think we're supposed to say that it's not real like he's like crazy or something there's no mist put the gun down now why would you say that
[389:43.91]Why are you telling me what to do?
[389:45.61]Yeah, you breathed in the mist.
[389:47.69]It's happening.
[389:48.53]There's no mist.
[389:50.19]I can feel it.
[389:55.37]There's no mist.
[389:56.32]What are you talking about?
[389:57.38]Come on, man.
[389:58.68]There is no mist.
[390:00.58]There it is.
[390:07.46]Oh, man.
[390:14.77]Why would he shoot her himself and not the guy who's like, there's no mist, dude.
[390:21.98]Hey, dude, what are you talking about?
[390:24.58]I am effectively telling you, me, that you're wrong.
[390:28.79]I'm going to shoot the person fucking next to you.
[390:30.59]Unabashedly out of your mind.
[390:33.43]I'm basically calling you crazy.
[390:35.07]I am essentially saying, hey, shoot me, please.
[390:37.11]I would like you to do it.
[390:39.30]That girl.
[390:44.38]Don't worry, I just grazed her head.
[390:47.20]She comes back the next day with like a bandage around her head.
[390:51.10]Wait by the radio.
[390:52.33]Why?
[390:53.23]I'm gonna check the next level.
[390:54.47]There might be some more gear down there we can use.
[390:57.19]He was just trying to scare her, and he missed.
[391:05.55]Okay, so here's the opportunity for us to screw this up somehow.
[391:10.80]Well, we already know what happens here.
[391:21.67]do we better choreography than game of thrones please come here I saw the the big guy he had the distributor cap better writing too
[391:56.12]Who was that?
[391:58.18]Mokka.
[391:58.92]Over here!
[392:14.35]This must have been what we just heard.
[392:22.17]Oh no, what's that?
[392:25.43]So this time, I'm gonna kill you.
[392:27.65]Brad is invincible.
[392:29.31]Brad is invincible.
[392:30.31]Brad is invincible?
[392:31.15]I mean... Are you Brad?
[392:45.94]No.
[393:01.67]Alright.
[393:07.81]Is this like a bad guy in the game?
[393:09.69]Or is this like a Diablo 3 loot goblin?
[393:14.56]He's just like... Oh, I... Fuck!
[393:17.20]Oh no!
[393:17.88]I pressed a button.
[393:18.50]Aren't we supposed to be running away from him?
[393:20.22]It feels like we're chasing him.
[393:22.94]My brain turned off and I just like... Did the QTE.
[393:30.30]Wait, you did the QTE?
[393:31.88]I did the first QTE.
[393:33.79]I don't think it matters, though.
[393:46.00]No, it doesn't matter.
[393:59.38]I'll follow them.
[394:00.08]I'll just find the little gold coins that are in a trail.
[394:04.13]Does anything matter when we saw that everyone gets gunned down at the end unless you fix the boat?
[394:10.45]That is true.
[394:14.03]There's one choice that really matters.
[394:17.35]And it's up to you to save the piece of equipment.
[394:21.39]I'm not going to make this jump, Alex.
[394:23.85]I'll have to find another way around.
[394:25.41]And then I'm going to stab you.
[394:28.63]Right.
[394:33.73]But then how do you die?
[394:35.21]Because you killed yourself last time.
[394:39.87]That's a... I don't know.
[394:41.09]Then I would just... I'd just get gunned down.
[394:45.86]Dude, my control is like fucking broken.
[394:51.04]What the hell is going on with this thing?
[394:53.76]Alright, we've seen this one before.
[394:59.11]I have an actual headache.
[395:04.03]Like, in real life?
[395:05.49]Yeah, from this video game.
[395:11.95]Oh, shit.
[395:13.61]I think the mist is seeping through.
[395:14.85]Too much mist?
[395:17.21]Well, we're almost done.
[395:20.13]We're almost done completely, so... Um, who's left to kill?
[395:27.50]Wait, can I just get eaten by rats?
[395:29.54]Fuck!
[395:30.46]So, do we want the everyone dies to gunfire at the end, or no?
[395:35.95]Well, there's only going to be like two or three.
[395:38.03]But you're like, yes or no, because I have to choose now.
[395:39.99]May as well just get us all killed.
[395:47.43]Because didn't we already go back and do this the right way?
[395:49.71]We did.
[395:53.99]We've seen both of those endings already.
[395:57.11]However, is it really a choice that I made right there?
[395:59.97]Oh, no!
[396:04.10]Oh, no!
[396:06.35]Like, did I make a choice or did I just try to open a door?
[396:10.99]I'm gonna try to be as menacing as possible.
[396:29.20]Wait, why are you different?
[396:33.46]Am I different?
[396:34.04]You're a different monster.
[396:37.30]Alex, it's me!
[396:39.26]What?
[396:43.58]It's a different person.
[396:47.89]Put the knife down.
[396:49.89]Now.
[396:50.85]Put it down.
[396:56.03]What?
[397:00.21]So what was the- I gotta watch to see what monster I was.
[397:03.40]You were like a two-headed, like, freak show.
[397:08.82]Now you're just the captain guy.
[397:13.26]Olsen.
[397:24.46]Alright, now what happens if I stop?
[397:34.26]What happens if I stop now?
[397:35.44]You're still going.
[397:39.64]But if I stop... I mean, you went right for center of mass with at least one of those.
[397:50.42]I did?
[397:51.60]Yeah.
[398:04.97]Oh, right.
[398:07.84]The reason you didn't see the two-headed monster is because when I was playing as Alex, we had found the two-headed monster in one of the coffins, so it was in his imagination.
[398:20.89]That's right.
[398:21.83]Oh.
[398:23.41]This time we speedran.
[398:24.51]It's not her.
[398:26.21]It's not her.
[398:27.60]It's not her.
[398:28.42]No, it's not.
[398:31.90]No, it's not.
[398:32.40]It's not her.
[398:43.97]all right we did it we we did it is uh we've played through the game twice we've played through the whole game two times I mean played is very loosely stated so now what happens if because we didn't tell anybody on the radio where we were
[399:07.07]yeah just locked up so if nobody knows where we are on the radio then we just live here now brothers till the end
[399:45.36]guess we're not going anywhere on the duke pretty much stuck here what a way to go starving to death wait what do you mean what what a way to go and that's it there's no food there's just people they could resort to cannibalism
[400:11.65]buy a little time maybe some old crates got some potatoes in cans or something I don't know yeah I mean you think uh I think I'm gonna go back in no no way there's gotta be some food somewhere in there right passions cans whatever's in there it's not worth getting we're gonna starve out here
[400:42.54]I'm gonna try to get the Duke of Milan out to sea.
[400:44.60]Make a boat.
[400:46.08]Take those crates.
[400:46.72]How are you gonna do that with no engine?
[400:51.29]Yeah, well, nowhere is better than this fucking ship.
[400:57.23]That's it, Ben.
[400:57.77]Are we saying goodbye to each other?
[401:04.84]Why aren't we doing this together?
[401:07.43]I don't know.
[401:08.09]It's odd to me that these two brothers just escaped their own version of hell and are instantly separating.
[401:15.32]I'm coming back for you.
[401:16.40]Why are you not going?
[401:17.68]What are you doing?
[401:20.72]He's just going to live on the ship and eat, I guess.
[401:25.72]For you to do that, you'd have to assume the other person's absolutely dead, but you fist bumped at the end, so you just don't care that they're going to die?
[401:42.75]Stay away from me!
[401:44.65]Why don't you go back in here for any reason?
[401:53.10]It's okay.
[401:53.40]There's only one other person here that can kill him.
[402:00.34]Wait.
[402:04.45]We didn't have any food on the boat?
[402:06.59]Imagine if two people were rowing this massive boat.
[402:11.08]There's a whole downstairs kitchen.
[402:19.37]It's Gendry.
[402:21.85]He's just running around in a circle in like the crazy drug...
[402:36.26]ship all right now for the post credit where the dude wakes up and I guess presumably kills alex because the helicopter shouldn't be coming yeah there's gonna be a danny versus alex at least there was actually a different ending drugged out fight yeah which makes it better than blair witch which also says choices matter
[403:05.29]at the beginning of the game.
[403:07.09]That's it.
[403:08.01]Game over.
[403:09.07]You're done.
[403:10.37]For now, at least.
[403:11.91]You could always try again.
[403:13.45]See if you can't do better next time around.
[403:18.29]Not a very happy ending.
[403:20.90]Or maybe it is.
[403:22.40]Do better.
[403:22.88]Depends what makes you happy, really.
[403:25.70]He knows.
[403:26.34]He's watching the stream.
[403:27.32]And the distributor cap?
[403:30.08]Boom.
[403:32.52]Unfortunate.
[403:36.30]It's all about decisions, isn't it?
[403:38.76]Decisions made in a hurry, in a panic, made with the heart instead of the head, or vice versa.
[403:46.38]Sometimes those decisions take a long time to have repercussions.
[403:52.03]But there are repercussions.
[403:54.25]But what were the long-term repercussions?
[403:57.31]There wasn't a scenario.
[403:57.93]Is he suggesting that in a future anthology game, those choices are going to matter?
[404:02.33]If they're separate games, I don't see how that's possible.
[404:06.68]But, like, we just overwrote everything that we did.
[404:10.25]But it can't be, because, yeah, it's not an anthology.
[404:29.18]Cool.
[404:29.66]All right.
[404:29.96]You're ready to see the... McDonald's menu item tier list.
[404:32.60]Now.
[404:32.76]You guys fucking cracked me up.
[404:34.02]New content.
[405:02.90]He's chafing a little, I think.
[405:05.24]Why would he be sitting above deck this entire time is the real question.
[405:08.10]With the sun and everything?
[405:08.98]No ship radio.
[405:25.46]You could fish, though.
[405:28.23]and stay alive well they have a grill they have a radio on the boat with a gps it just can't move and he's got beds under the deck in the kitchen they've got a radio antenna broke fishing isn't that easy
[406:00.66]Well, two, okay.
[406:01.34]Uh-oh, it's dead.
[406:13.21]Oh, you motherfuckers.
[406:18.10]That happened to you before it happened to me, apparently.
[406:22.76]Wait, I got jump scared first?
[406:24.96]Yeah, like a second before.
[406:26.86]So I, like, anticipated it.
[406:32.97]Good week.
[406:34.51]The whole stream watched this trailer for the next one three times.
[406:37.33]It wasn't even a Twitch bounty.
[406:47.27]Claim the Twitch bounty.
[407:03.23]We did it.
[407:06.61]Yeah.
[407:07.17]We stretched a three-hour game into however long that ended.
[407:10.39]Seven hours.
[407:10.91]All right.
[407:14.66]Let's give another review.
[407:15.92]Time for review two.
[407:17.50]Okay.
[407:17.88]So I have to go through twice and trying to do absolutely, like, just a dog shit run.
[407:24.54]Just a dog shit run.
[407:26.20]Can you do me a favor, though, and watch the clip of Conrad falling?
[407:30.54]I do want to watch that.
[407:35.21]Does anybody have that little clip of Conrad falling?
[407:39.03]I got it, yeah.
[407:40.93]You've already got it.
[407:41.67]Wow, that's impressive.
[407:42.69]I don't even have it.
[407:43.93]Let's watch it.
[407:45.85]We're going to watch it on stream.
[407:51.73]So this is the Conrad falling experience.
[407:55.61]Alright, hang on.
[407:56.07]Give me a count.
[407:56.80]Okay, let me get it up here.
[408:07.75]So this is from, it's Alex's perspective, this is him.
[408:10.53]I'm gonna start playing it.
[408:14.46]And let's check it out.
[408:16.60]Did you do the countdown?
[408:18.28]In three, two, one.
[408:20.92]In the door?
[408:21.40]Well then, what stopped the door?
[408:28.27]You closed it.
[408:29.81]Yeah, but your hand was in it.
[408:31.07]Somebody's hand was in it.
[408:34.93]Oh my god.
[408:37.07]Hey, he's done it!
[408:45.48]Ladies and gentlemen, all it took was seven failed QTEs in a row.
[409:11.00]Classic German laughing.
[409:14.07]Right at the end.
[409:14.73]Oh, because I walked over and it was just the camera panned down.
[409:18.49]Yeah, it was like super delayed laugh.
[409:20.43]I had no idea what you were seeing.
[409:21.97]Yeah, because I didn't see any of that shit.
[409:24.39]I walked over and the camera panned down the hole and you were just lying on your back.
[409:29.52]So imagine like Conrad.
[409:32.76]Okay, so you did see his body though.
[409:34.46]Yeah.
[409:34.68]Oh, yeah.
[409:35.52]Okay.
[409:36.38]So it wasn't a secret that he died.
[409:42.64]This game is fucking ridiculous.
[409:47.20]Yeah, this was the movies.
[409:51.04]I think it was like a fun co-op experiment that kind of lost sight of the foundation.
[410:01.31]The core principles.
[410:03.39]100%.
[410:09.14]It was like an interesting idea.
[410:12.15]I wish there were more co-op games.
[410:16.25]But you've got to have some core tenets of gameplay that we're missing.
[410:25.46]Well, so you want to do the next one?
[410:30.79]Like round three?
[410:32.87]No, I mean the next game.
[410:35.09]Are we going to play the Blair Witch Project one?
[410:38.95]I guess we have to at this point.
[410:40.39]We kind of have to.
[410:46.04]All right, well, that's a clean seven hours.
[410:51.04]It wasn't clean.
[410:51.85]Streams went down at least like ten times.
[410:55.95]It was an incredibly filthy, dirty stream.
[411:00.33]Careful.
[411:02.49]It was filthy.
[411:05.42]But, oh, yeah.
[411:07.60]That was Man of Medan.
[411:11.18]It was a game?
[411:11.88]Yeah.
[411:13.58]That was Man of Medan.
[411:17.04]We kind of knew what we were getting into.
[411:19.00]Just be glad you didn't do Blair Witch.
[411:26.16]I heard it was not very good.
[411:31.55]But I will see you guys tomorrow.
[411:33.89]I'm streaming tomorrow.
[411:35.59]That was Italics.
[411:37.15]Again, everybody, say hello to Italics.
[411:40.27]Go follow that stream.
[411:42.01]He streams too.
[411:43.41]You know, he's a fucking streamer.
[411:45.95]person that's in the call.
[411:47.95]Italy X?
[411:49.97]That is how you actually pronounce your name.
[411:55.62]Who is the Man of Medan?
[411:57.10]I don't know.
[411:57.42]I think that's the name of the big boat.
[412:01.66]Isn't it?
[412:01.98]That was like the gigantic boat.
[412:05.60]At least that's what I thought it was.
[412:08.14]Is the boat name Man of Medan?
[412:10.04]Yeah.
[412:14.66]What do you mean no?
[412:16.77]I don't think it is.
[412:17.89]It was the Duke of Medan.
[412:20.16]Yeah.
[412:20.72]It was the Duke of Milan.
[412:25.86]The man of... Whatever it was.
[412:29.18]That was the small boat.
[412:34.01]Man Milan.
[412:34.43]Alright, well, I'm going to get out of here.
[412:38.01]I don't know.
[412:38.69]I'm going to wind down.
[412:40.27]I'll... Hey, uh... Want to go to McDonald's?
[412:47.59]Uh, no.
[412:48.01]I ate McDonald's yesterday.
[412:50.63]Fuck!
[412:57.48]Anyways.
[412:57.84]Uh, that's the end.
[413:02.00]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[413:03.42]Tomorrow is... Let me just double check to make sure I got everything correct here.
[413:10.99]Tomorrow... We are going to do...
[413:18.61]um terraria I think we actually we're both of us are like on the same page so unless something else happens which I don't think it will we're going to finish terraria tomorrow those streams are cursed though because something seems to go wrong every time but we are finally going to close the book on terraria tomorrow
[413:47.33]It's going to be a chill stream.
[413:51.09]Thanks for joining me.
[413:52.45]We're going to go out here, do the bits, say hello to the subs.
[414:04.66]Plan B, I do have an extreme plan B. But I don't think we're going to need it.
[414:10.38]Because we did confirm that it was going to happen tomorrow.
[414:15.81]So don't worry.
[414:17.61]Alright, now I need to get out of here.
[414:24.46]And let's say goodnight.
[414:27.06]Thanks for joining us on Man of Adan.
[414:28.92]I don't think the game was... Look, the game was not that good.
[414:33.42]But the experience was fun.
[414:35.30]Because obviously we were just dicking around and having a good time.
[414:38.38]Playing this with one or two, maybe three or potential four people on a couch.
[414:42.76]There is some value there.
[414:43.94]There is.
[414:47.47]I had a blast.
[414:48.25]Hope you did, too.
[414:50.49]And if we don't see you tomorrow, maybe we'll see you next time.
[414:55.65]So let's rewind a little bit here.
[414:57.21]Let's go back to earlier.
[415:00.19]Lazy Luke had $3.
[415:01.39]They just said Subway 300.
[415:03.45]Thanks for the $3, Lazy Luke.
[415:06.55]Appreciate it.
[415:08.07]Thank you.
[415:10.80]Thank you, WikiThis, for the $3.
[415:12.76]This is truly the Citizen Kane of video game stories.
[415:19.33]I mean, it was cool.
[415:20.23]It's an interesting... Look, Super... Go back to Until Dawn.
[415:26.48]They did a similar kind of game last time.
[415:31.16]I almost feel like they tried to do too much of close to what they did before.
[415:39.27]This game felt like it was, hey, remember Until Dawn?
[415:41.83]There's monsters, and there might be other people, and there might be... There could be other... Is a monster a person?
[415:51.15]Or is it a monster?
[415:52.41]It is a monster.
[415:56.09]This actually seemed like it was... Like they rewrote Until Dawn.
[416:03.58]And it just wasn't as good.
[416:05.12]And it was way shorter.
[416:13.77]But the good thing is they made Until Dawn.
[416:18.47]And that game, I love that game.
[416:21.27]So this is one.
[416:23.63]Maybe in like two and three, they'll start to, you know, there's been some criticisms of this game already.
[416:31.03]I have faith that Supermassive will, over the next few games in this anthology, maybe kind of change it up a little bit.
[416:48.90]Because, I mean, they did do... They made Until Dawn.
[416:54.58]If not, then that's a letdown.
[416:56.26]Because there's not very many good horror experiences.
[417:01.17]There are some.
[417:05.53]But it's kind of hard to find a really, really, truly good horror game.
[417:15.28]At least in the last...
[417:18.65]I'll wait.
[417:20.13]At least in the last three or four years.
[417:22.41]Five years or so.
[417:24.58]Play Silent... Yeah, Silent Hill 2 came out like 15 years ago.
[417:27.74]I'm talking about like now.
[417:30.04]I don't mean that there's never been a good horror game.
[417:33.92]You know, just never.
[417:35.04]No, I'm talking about like the last like five years.
[417:46.11]There's been a couple.
[417:46.99]And I've played some of them already.
[417:51.20]Resident Evil 2... Was... Resident Evil 7 was... No.
[417:57.40]Resident Evil 7, the first, like, six hours of Resident Evil 7 was an awesome horror game.
[418:03.91]And then they lost me for a little while.
[418:06.77]And then the end was pretty good.
[418:11.81]I didn't like that kind of mid to late game in Resident Evil 7.
[418:18.64]on the boat with you know uh but I don't want to give any spoilers but once it became not a scary game anymore it was kind of just you know I don't I don't want to talk about it because I don't know who's people haven't played it yet but there was a big string there and I streamed that whole game in vr the whole game
[418:43.95]They lost me at that end part.
[418:45.73]But the first like 6 to 12, 6 to 10 hours of Resident Evil 7 was fantastic.
[418:50.77]We'll see if the next anthology games are any good.
[419:01.08]But thank you to Demons V for the $15.
[419:05.56]They say blood sacrifice and then like a face.
[419:11.93]Thank you for the $15, Demons V.
[419:14.82]Really appreciate it.
[419:17.87]Stix Renegade, thanks for the 250.
[419:21.03]I'm fucking revoking your gamer license.
[419:26.10]What gaming did I do tonight?
[419:37.67]You can't do that.
[419:43.14]But thank you, StixRenegade.
[419:44.72]I didn't know you were an authority on the gamer licenses.
[419:52.10]ShittyViewBot, thanks for the $10.
[419:53.90]Just admit, JermaBuddy, you fucked up.
[419:58.81]I did.
[419:59.09]I know I did.
[420:06.13]It's alright.
[420:08.35]I did.
[420:08.69]I messed up.
[420:10.50]But thank you for the $10, ShittyViewBot.
[420:15.99]Errorless, thanks for the $2.50.
[420:16.85]Hey, Jerma, can you give these bits to Italics, please?
[420:20.75]Yeah.
[420:23.49]Let me go to McDonald's.
[420:24.87]And I buy him a McChicken.
[420:29.15]Thank you, though.
[420:31.77]Thank you, Trampston, for the $5.
[420:33.24]I'm going to come through this monitor and give you a peck.
[420:37.58]A punch on the nose.
[420:38.76]What?
[420:38.90]What?
[420:42.50]We are going to... This is going to be an interesting... This is going to be a very interesting... Credits.
[420:50.94]Because the stream... Twitch had a ton of problems.
[420:53.84]Earlier tonight.
[420:55.30]And the stream turned off like... Probably five to six times.
[421:03.32]I am curious as to see if any of... If who even is on this list.
[421:08.97]Still pretty significant.
[421:12.63]Now, it was definitely not Cox.
[421:15.11]Because there were portions where Italics' stream would be at zero and I would still be fine and live.
[421:21.36]And other people were talking about how there was other streamers having problems.
[421:24.60]So I guess it was because it stopped.
[421:28.92]So I don't think that was a Cox thing tonight.
[421:35.45]But thank you to Trampston.
[421:37.47]Appreciate it.
[421:39.43]What's the name of the song?
[421:40.19]This is an original song by Blordo.
[421:42.69]This is an original made for the end of this stream song.
[421:55.40]Speaking of which, I still have stuff that I have to put on.
[421:58.66]It seems like every day something else is happening that I can't just sit down and do it.
[422:07.44]But I do, I have new stuff from Blordo.
[422:10.36]I have it.
[422:11.56]I have to just set it up and do it and set up the scenes and everything.
[422:14.24]And I just haven't been able to sit down and do it.
[422:22.24]But yes, you will see that.
[422:24.57]I'm... It has to be.
[422:27.79]Like... The next time I stream after this weekend, it'll all be there.
[422:32.51]It has to be.
[422:33.03]Like, I've held on for too long.
[422:42.23]That is good shit, though.
[422:43.72]You guys are going to like it.
[422:49.91]OST.
[422:50.43]A German 995.
[422:50.85]O-S-T.
[422:58.74]Need some more emotes, too.
[422:59.80]Yeah.
[423:01.30]I gotta do a whole... Once the carnival stream is done, I'll have a lot more brain power to actually sit down.
[423:09.52]Because there's a lot going on in September.
[423:12.28]The carnival stream is coming up really soon.
[423:14.82]TwitchCon is right after that.
[423:18.42]So, my brain is kind of all over the place this month.
[423:28.53]But good night, everybody.
[423:30.87]We'll see you tomorrow if you show up.
[423:35.79]Am I going to TwitchCon?
[423:36.81]I am.
[423:39.28]But I am going to because of the Carnival stream.
[423:45.90]I'm not going to go the whole time.
[423:48.52]So I will only be at TwitchCon for like a day or two.
[423:54.10]So I'm not gonna be there from Thursday to Monday, or what a lot of people usually do.
[424:03.85]But I will be there for at least a day or two.
[424:15.22]When's the new Discord channel going up for videos, art, and all that?
[424:19.15]I'm going to talk to... I will have a little mod thing tomorrow.
[424:25.91]Tomorrow after my stream, I'll just get that all set up.
[424:28.39]I'm also going to get a hard date for the activity book stream after tomorrow's stream.
[424:33.73]So I'll give you all this information soon.
[424:35.84]I'm going to see who's around tomorrow to talk about it all.
[424:43.06]So stay tuned.
[424:45.71]But I will see you guys tomorrow.
[424:47.86]Take care.
[424:48.22]Until then, goodbye for now.
[424:53.98]See you later.
