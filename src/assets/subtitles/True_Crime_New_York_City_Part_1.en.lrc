[ve:60.16.100]

[00:12.65]Why do we do this when we stretch?
[00:14.39]I just came out of an egg.
[00:16.53]That was a dinosaur coming out of an egg.
[00:21.58]Hey.
[00:22.68]Hi, everybody.
[00:24.94]You notice that, though?
[00:25.58]Right off the bat, we're gonna do just some weird shit.
[00:31.12]You know when you stretch in the morning, you wake up in bed, and you just scream?
[00:39.42]I don't know why we do that.
[00:42.42]I do it every morning.
[00:43.70]What you just heard is what I do in bed.
[00:48.85]Anyways, it's been a week.
[00:52.91]Sorry I was away for so long.
[00:54.83]And then before that was PAX and I will explain in greater detail when more people come in.
[01:02.04]But we're here now.
[01:05.26]4 p.m.
[01:05.60]is not morning?
[01:06.34]Well, no, I'm just saying, like, that, I was stretching, and I was making that noise.
[01:10.10]You make the same noise while stretching that you do when you wake up in the morning.
[01:18.19]Let me make a tweet here.
[01:19.07]There we go.
[01:22.71]Okay.
[01:28.04]Yeah, true crime, New York.
[01:30.38]This is not the PlayStation 2 version.
[01:33.13]This is, in fact, the PC version, which is going to be way better.
[01:42.00]Yeah, you stretch in the morning.
[01:42.88]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:44.84]Got some new emotes, too, as you can see.
[01:48.11]Four of them, to be exact.
[01:50.99]We have Bald Coin.
[01:52.93]jermaEarth has returned from his vacation.
[01:54.81]So, you know, he's got his sun hat on, his sunscreen on his nose.

[02:27.29]Yeah.
[02:28.49]Anyone that was looking for... Oh, wait, what's it gonna have for a $25 emote?
[02:31.85]Oh, it's gonna be... It's gotta be, like, really worth... Nope.
[02:34.53]It ain't worth $25.
[02:35.01]Anywho.
[02:43.62]Um... I'm sorry for my absence.
[02:47.34]Yeah.
[02:48.93]We're going to try to come back strong here.
[02:52.47]If you don't know, a lot of you guys knew that I was going to awaken a funeral over this past week.
[03:01.32]Well, I went to another one in the same week.
[03:05.80]That's why there was nothing over the last couple of days over the weekend.
[03:09.82]So another friend of the family passed away.
[03:13.06]So it was kind of not cool, you know?
[03:18.38]It sucked.
[03:20.44]Two wakes, funerals in the same week.
[03:23.41]But I'm back.
[03:24.81]I'm here.
[03:27.87]Took a week off, so I'm good to go.
[03:32.02]We're going to start here.
[03:32.72]We're going to get over to True Crime Streets of New York.
[03:36.50]And let's move some stuff out of the way.
[03:38.28]We'll get started.
[03:56.11]Somebody just bought the expensive emote.
[04:03.04]Oh, no.
[04:05.78]He did it.
[04:06.98]He actually did it.
[04:10.53]Pogefest just bought the $25 emote.
[04:13.37]There you go.
[04:17.25]He's the only guy that's gonna have it.
[04:20.47]An exclusive club.
[04:23.11]Alright, let's go.
[04:25.35]Let's move over to the game.
[04:29.87]Let me have it.
[04:32.98]Anywho.
[04:35.10]Probably looks a lot better than it did last time.
[04:37.88]Remember how awful it looked last time?
[04:40.42]It's because we were actually in a PlayStation 2.
[04:43.92]Look at how much better this looks on PC.
[04:46.52]Think about this.
[04:48.41]Look at the difference.
[04:49.89]Just in being able to see the character's face.
[04:55.41]I thought that was a Twitch alert.
[04:57.59]I thought that was somebody subbing or something.
[05:02.74]Alright, so we did this before, but I got here just to do it again.
[05:05.98]Now, all the controls are wrong.
[05:08.48]So, it is in fact not... It is not Pad 7 and Pad 9.
[05:14.75]I believe it is Mouse 3 and Mouse 4.
[05:21.69]Yes, it is my thumb mouses.
[05:26.01]That's going to be an issue.
[05:27.29]By the way, I looked into it.
[05:28.71]Cannot change the controls.
[05:30.80]Cannot do an input mapper.
[05:32.98]Okay, here we go.
[05:37.88]Directional.
[05:39.94]Hold shift to lock onto opponent and press.
[05:42.16]Isn't that, it's not a directional move?
[05:53.70]Oh, okay, I have to move.
[05:54.96]Okay.
[05:55.26]Here we go.
[06:01.10]That's not it?
[06:01.66]Those aren't directional moves?
[06:05.89]Pull and hold shift.
[06:07.55]And then... There we go.
[06:11.69]Okay, I get it.
[06:13.75]You can swing behind you.
[06:17.13]That's gonna be so funny.
[06:20.23]Oh, I can't wait to do that to somebody.
[06:22.07]Like a random pedestrian.
[06:25.39]Okay.
[06:31.70]Let's kick them in the ground.
[06:32.80]We did this before.
[06:36.08]Although, it unfortunately does not translate very well.
[06:39.42]I will tell you.
[06:40.04]Please climb.
[06:41.44]Yes.
[06:51.99]Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[06:52.77]Yeah, I forgot I broke this guy's neck.
[06:55.45]Pad plus to grapple.
[06:58.63]Okay, here we go.
[06:59.53]Let's find out what pad plus is.
[07:02.70]It's not left click.
[07:04.16]It's not punch.
[07:05.50]That's punch.
[07:06.20]Okay, what about Q?
[07:09.68]Okay, that's hold up my badge.
[07:12.40]I'm not going to press the plus button to grab someone.
[07:15.71]It has to be something else.
[07:16.49]C, F...
[07:19.04]V. G. H. R. R?
[07:24.74]No, R is block.
[07:25.96]T. Y. U. I. O. P. L. M. L. K. M. I. A. Tab.
[07:38.01]No, that's not cool.
[07:41.23]Shift.
[07:42.56]Caps lock.
[07:43.96]Alt.
[07:44.40]Control.
[07:45.26]Z. X.
[07:49.53]Mmm.
[07:50.95]Okay.
[07:52.45]Controller info.
[07:54.47]Here we go.
[07:54.89]Wait, can I change this shit?
[07:58.45]I can't.
[07:59.61]Okay.
[07:59.97]Crouch.
[08:00.55]Light attack.
[08:03.41]Light punch target.
[08:04.63]Grapple.
[08:05.31]Forward.
[08:06.11]W. Control.
[08:07.27]And button two is grapple.
[08:10.49]W. Forward and grapple.
[08:14.65]It's plus.
[08:15.33]Well, you know, plus is next to backspace.
[08:18.33]I'm not going to press... That is so uncomfortable to do that.
[08:22.23]That's grapple, but there's a way to do it with your hands.
[08:27.71]Because I have to press that on my... Oh my god, that's going to be so horrible.
[08:33.53]I have to take my hand off the mouse to do that.
[08:39.90]Because look, punch is...
[08:42.83]For instance, let me show you.
[08:44.61]So if you look at punch.
[08:51.95]Like basic attack.
[08:54.33]And like getting in and out of cars is the same thing.
[08:57.63]You know, it's left click sometimes, but it's also F. F is fire, but fire is also left click.
[09:06.13]So it's weird.
[09:09.59]Okay, let me make sure.
[09:10.49]I mean, light to grapple.
[09:14.08]Button two.
[09:17.90]So what is the middle mouse?
[09:18.92]That's select weapon, okay.
[09:20.92]Just gonna have to deal with it for now.
[09:24.52]Crouch and then hit the number pad.
[09:27.10]Okay, I took him down.
[09:28.72]Hold R to block.
[09:42.80]People are buying that thing.
[09:44.70]That's so funny.
[09:50.03]Hold control mouse 2.
[09:51.19]No, it's not doing it.
[09:54.81]It is something weird though.
[09:56.21]Control W mouse 2.
[09:57.31]No, that's like a big punch.
[10:02.35]It's all over the place.
[10:03.23]I'll figure it out eventually.
[10:04.19]Alright, just kick everybody's ass.
[10:12.01]Extra points, sick!
[10:16.97]Where am I?
[10:18.91]Wait, hey, hey, it's just an exercise, buddy.
[10:20.83]Chill out.
[10:21.25]I already love this game.
[10:33.44]Ah, double punch right there.
[10:34.62]You see the double?
[10:35.44]I gotta grab somebody.
[10:39.43]Are you?
[10:40.77]Get up here, chokeslam!
[10:42.71]I thought that guy had a record scratch.
[10:50.82]Take care of the guy that's currently right here.
[10:55.38]Oh, come on.
[11:03.29]Walk a couple times so I can get used to it.
[11:06.87]Get out of here.
[11:08.89]Oh wait, I'm killing these guys.
[11:16.84]How does that- Alright, well whatever.
[11:17.90]We got- Remember when it was last time we played this, I said, I can't do this.
[11:21.54]We're gonna do it when we got better access to the door.
[11:24.66]See, I didn't kill anybody.
[11:31.06]Actual death?
[11:31.76]No, that shouldn't be happening.
[11:32.85]But here's a good cutscene.
[11:33.63]This is where we left off.
[11:35.51]No, it's not.
[11:37.40]Nevermind.
[11:38.02]Oh yeah, I forgot about this.
[11:40.97]Page up, page down.
[11:42.17]No, but see what I'm talking about?
[11:44.03]It's not, there's mouse.
[11:45.75]You can do things with the mouse.
[11:48.59]Ooh, that stuff.
[11:49.99]That, that is mouse.
[11:52.35]Okay, this is a Ouija board.
[11:57.34]Somebody else is moving the mouse with me.
[12:01.84]When I move, sometimes it doesn't move.
[12:03.36]And when I move slowly, it goes fast.
[12:05.18]When I move fast, it goes slowly.
[12:07.72]Okay, well... Come on, do it.
[12:14.12]Go!
[12:16.21]Jump over this!
[12:19.19]Come on, do it!
[12:20.77]Don't make me look like a fool!
[12:24.29]Okay.
[12:38.86]E?
[12:42.66]What?
[12:43.42]Oh.
[12:44.20]Okay.
[12:45.72]Click C to hug it.
[12:46.86]There we go.
[12:53.81]This Ouija board.
[12:57.81]That sucks.
[12:59.63]The controller may have been better.
[13:01.03]I'm not even kidding.
[13:09.09]F to throw objects.
[13:13.15]Can I aim this better?
[13:16.53]Can I throw this higher or lower?
[13:19.13]There we go.
[13:20.03]Okay.
[13:24.13]Let's move.
[13:24.67]Police remains.
[13:25.87]Pad 5.
[13:26.39]There it is.
[13:27.57]Middle mouse button.
[13:42.67]Utilize that guy.
[13:43.99]Utilize that guy.
[13:47.62]Watch out, that guy has a nerf gun.
[13:50.84]Oh, sand.
[13:53.56]Oh.
[13:53.80]I snuck behind him.
[13:55.74]I had to get behind him first.
[13:58.08]Innocent.
[13:59.48]Non-innocent.
[14:16.10]No, this is way easier than using the controller.
[14:17.82]This still is awful, but, you know, we can always cheat, too.
[14:20.46]You know what I'm saying?
[14:21.66]I can hold down shift and it just auto-targets.
[14:26.50]Wait, why is a headshot a bad pup?
[14:32.55]Can you turn off mouse acceleration?
[14:33.81]You cannot.
[14:37.39]You cannot turn it off.
[14:40.97]Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to get in the vehicle.
[14:49.01]W accelerator.
[14:51.39]And that's how you steer.
[14:52.21]Of course it is just like in Grand Theft.
[14:55.33]Space.
[14:57.85]That's a very, very, very, very sensitive handbrake.
[15:05.00]That's how you change camera.
[15:12.22]You need to aim for the heads.
[15:14.26]Press pull F. Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[15:16.21]What is a pull F?
[15:17.93]How do I aim?
[15:18.91]That wasn't even on there for that fast.
[15:21.51]Shift?
[15:23.03]How do I aim the gun?
[15:23.83]Do I have a gun on my cop car?
[15:33.07]How do I aim?
[15:35.67]I can't aim this.
[15:37.46]This is just twisted metal.
[15:44.94]That's what I have to do.
[15:51.98]Yeah, get killed!
[15:56.11]Co-op cop?
[15:58.71]Is it numpad?
[15:59.99]Yes, it is.
[16:02.95]No, it's not.
[16:06.57]I know, I didn't know.
[16:07.81]Come on, who cares if I hit that guy?
[16:09.77]That's the AOL Instant Messenger guy.
[16:11.46]That company doesn't even exist.
[16:15.58]Like, you guys are so upset about me hitting that guy.
[16:18.50]When was the last fucking time you used aim?
[16:26.43]Co-op car.
[16:27.61]Here we go.
[16:29.21]Cutsie!
[16:31.03]Nobody even said anything.
[16:33.15]Alright, you know what?
[16:35.99]Don't bother.
[16:42.58]Okay, I love you, too.
[16:43.76]Why don't you just move into the city, Vic?
[16:45.52]I'd like to invest in a Jerm of bald corn.
[16:47.88]My lady.
[16:48.42]My salmon.
[16:49.94]You're kidding, right?
[16:51.93]Looks like you still have both feet, kid.
[16:57.49]Was I fucking right about this guy or what?
[17:00.21]Denzel, he got nothing on you, kid.
[17:01.99]Oh, for Christ's sakes, Terry.
[17:03.79]How hard is it to shoot a target?
[17:06.28]I want you to take him into the street, see if he can handle himself in plain clothes and deal with real perks.
[17:11.92]Who holds real?
[17:13.20]Otherwise, no shields.
[17:14.38]Comprende?
[17:15.10]Okay, boy wonder.
[17:16.06]Time to kiss your costume goodbye.
[17:18.07]Grab your street gear.
[17:19.39]Alright, time to go undercover.
[17:20.73]Time to go undercover and punch.
[17:22.97]I got your boy wonder right here.
[17:27.56]Music.
[17:28.04]Whoa.
[17:28.40]That was a bad place for the music to cut.
[17:33.61]I should have probably kept walking after that.
[17:35.83]That was a good exit.
[17:38.35]Nah, this is awkward.
[17:40.27]I made this weird.
[17:48.76]I was trying to break that guy's neck, but I can't, apparently.
[17:53.72]This is just like in Diablo.
[17:57.05]You can't attack in the town.
[17:58.57]I got it.
[18:00.35]Alright, use the elevator.
[18:07.89]Select the floor.
[18:09.05]We're just going... We can only go one place.
[18:17.42]Huh?
[18:17.80]Wait.
[18:18.28]I thought the whole world changed around me.
[18:23.64]That was weird.
[18:24.56]Okay.
[18:24.88]Approach the locker.
[18:29.32]Let's get some clothes.
[18:30.16]Okay.
[18:30.56]Street.
[18:34.28]All I have is space wear.
[18:36.98]Where's my helmet?
[18:38.04]Where's my oxygen tank?
[18:41.88]You know what I'm saying?
[18:45.66]Where's the spaceship?
[18:50.77]I don't know.
[18:57.07]I would like to.
[18:59.42]In the locker.
[19:01.62]Okay.
[19:02.44]Well, that was weird.
[19:03.96]Alright, let's go.
[19:07.46]Approach the garage attendant.
[19:08.60]Let's get a car.
[19:09.68]That guy's doing a really good impression of me doing an impression of Vin Diesel.
[19:14.55]Alright, 10 grand.
[19:16.57]I don't have any money.
[19:19.40]Do I get a free car?
[19:20.88]Okay, here's the free car.
[19:23.76]Okay, coming right up.
[19:26.92]And drive outside.
[19:28.04]Here we go.
[19:34.85]And so it begins.
[19:35.65]I thought it was going to go right into the car.
[19:40.49]Right into the wall.
[19:45.80]First criminal.
[19:48.19]He thinks he can get away with stealing from the post office.
[19:50.85]No, no, that's, never mind.
[19:51.71]He's gonna do a thing.
[19:53.03]Let's cruise.
[19:53.44]Where we off to first?
[19:54.18]Uh, this is not me driving.
[19:54.86]Holy shit, this place is dirty.
[20:11.63]Are you looking this dirty?
[20:12.73]Why is there so much trash everywhere?
[20:16.60]Are you serious?
[20:20.64]Look at this.
[20:21.16]This trash tornado.
[20:21.82]Why is it so dirty?
[20:32.78]This is so distracting.
[20:36.00]Alright, let's use the siren.
[20:42.09]Okay, I'm serious.
[20:42.93]This is like... This is some... This is some... Some parody and some satire here.
[20:50.34]But New York... Look, there's even telephone poles that are trash that are flying around.
[20:55.78]New York City's not this dirty.
[20:58.28]Hey!
[21:00.03]Wait, is this telling me when to drive?
[21:03.78]What are the directions here?
[21:08.36]Is it telling me to go straight?
[21:12.20]I keep seeing the directions on the screen.
[21:17.86]Take a left, right?
[21:19.54]I'm right.
[21:20.12]See what it's saying?
[21:20.72]It's like 8th Avenue.
[21:21.48]Go that way.
[21:27.52]I can see it on the minimap, but should I be listening to these directions?
[21:35.92]You would not have flown out the driver's side window.
[21:44.64]You would not have flown out that window.
[21:46.07]You would have gone out the front.
[21:48.89]Oh my god.
[21:49.61]No, okay, so it isn't telling me these directions.
[21:51.47]I just have to follow the minimap.
[21:54.32]My god.
[21:55.52]Alright.
[21:56.04]This is ridiculous.
[21:56.82]Oh, these trash cans.
[21:57.92]He's unbelievable.
[21:58.98]Okay.
[21:59.10]Keep your phone on.
[21:59.71]I'll run you through a few basics.
[22:01.15]Okay.
[22:01.29]Keep your phone on you.
[22:19.64]No, this is somebody... We're in a server and somebody is spawning items.
[22:28.00]Some admin is doing admin abuse with random Garry's Mod items that they're spawning into the server.
[22:33.58]Wait, what the fuck are you talking about?

[23:05.75]Is he hailing a cab?
[23:07.59]Alright, do I put him in the car?
[23:09.65]We're taking this guy in, right?
[23:12.23]What am I supposed to do with this guy?
[23:16.16]I found the drugs.
[23:17.22]How do we put him in the car?
[23:18.96]Suspect is now under arrest.
[23:21.92]Good going.
[23:22.82]Next, I want to see you inspect the car.
[23:25.06]Walk over to the parked car over there and pop his trunk for me, would you?
[23:28.86]Pop his trunk with E?
[23:29.84]Police!
[23:30.62]Pop your trunk!
[23:31.28]Hey, looks like you found something.

[23:38.16]Okay.
[23:38.64]Whoa, look at these guys.
[23:40.67]We got a few hard cases.
[23:42.89]Well, you should already know there are different types of perps.
[23:47.15]It's the same guy.
[23:48.07]No, the fat guy crews are fighting each other.
[23:52.67]This is a rival fat gang.
[23:53.85]I don't even care.
[23:54.39]I want to watch.
[23:54.85]No, we're the better fat guy gang than you.
[24:17.20]They've not hit each other once.
[24:19.90]Holy shit, you guys suck.
[24:23.66]Alright, break it up!
[24:27.37]A warning shot?
[24:29.25]Alright, well, these guys gave up.
[24:32.27]These dudes don't want to give up, though.
[24:37.01]Oh, sorry.
[24:37.55]Cheat.
[24:37.77]Yeah, it turns out they were just using Nerf bats.
[24:39.79]It's okay.
[24:40.39]They're having fun.
[24:42.81]Alright!
[24:43.53]Nice shooting.
[24:44.57]Now put some cuffs on those pricks before they run for it.
[24:49.11]Yo, this is getting to be easy.
[24:53.19]Get out of here.
[24:56.78]They're all under arrest.
[25:04.12]Hey, Marcus, are you paying attention?
[25:06.08]One of your collars is getting away.
[25:08.36]No, shit!
[25:08.76]How do I shoot the gun?
[25:09.68]Oh, fucking Marcus, I don't know.
[25:18.63]Left click wasn't doing anything.
[25:20.71]F wasn't doing anything.
[25:22.11]Only Q. It drove directly into the fucking fire.
[25:32.46]Okay, now we have to... No, seriously, like, I guess I can't shoot him.
[25:38.18]What the hell are you waiting for?
[25:39.22]Oh, my God, just get out.
[25:40.76]I'll get it now.
[25:41.92]Pick three pills and pat them down for contraband.
[25:44.69]Why you got to cringe on my rights and shit?
[25:47.91]Ugh.
[25:49.32]Press Q. Hey, I'm on parole.
[25:50.98]I ain't trying to mess that up.
[25:52.52]Q was the only thing that was working.
[25:53.75]Nothing else worked.
[25:54.57]Alright, evidence.
[25:56.07]Fine.
[25:56.25]Get him.
[25:56.43]Here comes the brawl.
[25:57.21]Oh, my God.
[25:57.83]Give me a break.
[25:58.47]Here comes the brawl.
[25:59.99]Whoa.
[26:18.97]There are the unarmed types.
[26:20.49]Shooting these guys is a definite no-no.
[26:22.47]Alright, so I gotta get, I gotta destroy it faster.
[26:25.17]I'm gonna shoot in the air, arrest everybody, and then chase the guy down and punch.
[26:28.87]One of my favorite, the jokers that are back in heat.
[26:32.91]Wait a minute, hold on.
[26:33.73]That guy's the joker.
[26:35.23]Whoa, what's going on over there?
[26:36.33]Looks like we got a barb roll.
[26:38.49]Alright, cool it, everybody.
[26:41.22]When the badge doesn't do the trick, look at that.
[26:44.36]Nice shooting.
[26:45.40]Now put some cuffs on those pricks before they run for it.
[26:51.66]Somebody's gonna run for this car.
[26:52.78]If I swear to God.
[26:53.96]Alright, don't let him get away.
[26:59.00]Dude, how am I supposed... What the fuck?
[27:01.14]So seriously, what the fuck?
[27:03.12]Why?
[27:17.88]He just fucking runs away.
[27:19.66]He gets away.
[27:21.31]Even if I press Q. Oh my fucking god, man.
[27:24.91]No, really.
[27:25.19]Get in a car.
[27:25.93]I gotta get in our car.
[27:26.97]Can I take this car?
[27:27.75]Okay.
[27:27.97]So I can go in that car.
[27:44.54]It happens so quickly.
[27:45.66]And he crashes every single time.
[27:47.48]Kill him before he runs.
[27:48.94]I can't shoot the gun.
[27:49.84]I can only shoot the gun in the air.
[28:17.57]We're just stuck in this fucking place.
[28:20.11]Yeah, hold the Q out.
[28:22.49]Fire warning shot.
[28:26.25]You're going away first.
[28:27.15]That guy tried to run away every time.
[28:32.17]Then I'm gonna get in the car and just chase him.
[28:35.98]Cancel Christmas.
[28:44.43]Alright this is well, what the hell are you waiting for?
[29:11.76]There's no, there are no cars.
[29:14.76]There are no cars.
[29:18.00]You see how this street is fucking empty?
[29:19.90]How am I supposed to find a car when there are no cars and the test ends instantly?
[29:30.29]What?
[29:31.57]Get in my car.
[29:33.03]I can't.
[29:33.59]Look it.
[29:34.95]He says the test isn't over.
[29:37.37]I can't get in that car.
[29:39.47]Look, I ain't doing anything.
[29:41.47]Why you hassling me?
[29:43.48]No, this is not my fault.
[29:44.84]This is just fucking crazy.
[29:48.31]It says, shoot the gun in the air!
[29:50.15]I'm just running over there.
[29:51.15]Is the FPS like a thousand times normal?
[29:53.81]It might be.
[30:15.41]I'm gonna get in front of the car.
[30:16.91]I'm just gonna get in front of the car and fucking shoot.
[30:19.43]Maybe that's the problem.
[30:20.24]Is it running like too fast?
[30:37.87]Yeah, approach.
[30:39.37]They stop if you... I'm just going to get in front of his car and shoot the gun.
[30:43.24]Don't run after him.
[30:44.72]Do not run after him.
[30:49.16]Okay, so don't run after him.
[30:50.76]Oh shit, there he goes.

[32:17.60]Ah, shit.
[32:18.00]Oh well, it's too late.
[32:20.86]The audio is synced fine, so it can't be?

[44:11.92]I'm just causing problems for the precinct.
[44:15.20]I am just... I need to get fired.
[44:17.58]They need to get rid of me.
[44:19.31]Because all I'm doing is being a deterrent.
[44:21.29]I'm causing issues.
[44:25.35]I am pretty much helping the criminal at this point.
[44:28.95]He got away.
[44:34.03]First of all, no.
[44:35.33]I understand the problem.
[44:36.54]Get out of this.

[46:21.31]If Parrish died tomorrow, I'd throw him.
[46:23.31]Sorry, I gotta inspect you.
[46:24.73]You ain't no cop.
[46:25.67]I can't believe this shit.

[54:10.22]It wasn't even on Nintendo.
[54:11.20]Where you built your own track and you press the button, the trigger, you held it down gently.
[54:15.94]And if you held it down even a hair too much, they freaked out and flew off the track.
[54:20.22]Those tiny little micro cars.
[54:21.56]Alright, we got an issue here.

[70:22.18]Surrender.
[70:22.44]You're done.
[70:25.24]Don't.
[70:26.16]Don't do it.
[70:27.24]Give me the gun.
[70:27.90]Get on the ground.
[70:44.83]Police!
[70:45.51]Stop right there!
[70:47.05]Don't shoot him.
[70:47.65]I'm currently trying to arrest him.
[70:51.37]Come here!
[70:52.30]I'm going to teach you a lesson.
[70:53.24]Why are they coming back?
[70:55.40]Hey, you dumbass.
[70:56.28]You're going to sleep with the fishes now.
[71:09.23]Okay, honest to God, do I have to beat him up until he's on the ground dead before I can arrest him?
[71:15.99]I can't arrest them.
[71:20.82]I can't shoot them, and I can't arrest them.
[71:23.60]So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[71:24.94]That guy had five different weapons on him.
[71:35.97]So I just have to beat the shit out of them until their health bar goes to zero, and then I can arrest them.
[71:42.88]If they don't surrender, I can't arrest.
[71:44.92]So yeah, so I have to kill them and arrest their dead unconscious body.
[71:50.00]Okay, as long as you don't shoot them.
[71:53.15]I can handle that.
[71:58.41]But what if they take out a gun?
[71:59.93]And then I have to get shot.
[72:04.34]Deluxe.
[72:05.52]They don't need those.
[72:09.10]Can we order an ice cream?
[72:12.76]Oh, you can.
[72:14.38]Soda.
[72:15.50]Five dollars for a soda, huh?
[72:17.56]There's nobody here.
[72:20.43]I can't even buy it.
[72:22.53]Okay.
[72:23.07]Fighting pedestrians.
[72:25.59]Let's go.
[72:27.75]I should be able to get this here.
[72:29.37]I'm just going to beat them until they are done with their health bars.
[72:34.55]I'm going to hurt them.
[72:35.90]I'm going to... That guy's putting... That cop has a shotgun.
[72:39.42]Okay, well, get it.
[72:46.44]That guy has the shotgun.
[72:47.26]That's fine.
[72:47.56]Just kick this lady until she's... Okay, now we get three arrests.
[72:53.02]Good cop.
[72:57.50]Why am I not getting this?
[72:58.78]This is two and then here's three, right?
[73:01.10]Good.
[73:01.66]Did it.
[73:02.04]Finally.
[73:02.50]Okay.
[73:02.68]Now we just... Just get over there.
[73:04.26]Don't cause any problems.
[73:06.07]Just get to the next part of the game.
[73:08.45]It's not a big deal.
[73:09.31]Don't hit anybody.
[73:09.99]Don't run anybody over.
[73:28.28]Violent?
[73:28.72]Vegetarian?
[73:30.40]I'm sitting there reading.
[73:32.26]Oh, God.
[73:35.03]Let's try to get some more good boy points.
[73:36.85]What do you say?
[73:37.37]I think that's a good idea.
[73:38.15]What do you think?
[73:43.51]Some GBP?
[73:50.91]Alright.
[73:51.43]I'm going to play this normally.
[73:54.17]There's a vegetarian vandal in here.
[73:56.71]Let's arrest them.
[73:59.74]That's it.
[74:00.12]Police.
[74:00.38]Police.
[74:00.72]They got bats.
[74:01.28]Look, they got bats.
[74:01.82]They're... Fucking vegans.
[74:04.96]Goddamn vegetarians.
[74:06.99]Stay down.
[74:08.07]Ugh.
[74:30.28]Give me the bat.
[74:33.24]There we go, now I got a bat.
[74:34.88]You ready to go?
[74:35.40]Now look who gets to play.
[74:39.93]Oh, look at that, what's that, a two-handed swing into your head?
[74:42.99]There we, okay.
[74:56.79]A plus police work.
[75:02.92]I like the bat.
[75:03.42]I want to keep it.
[75:06.88]She's current.
[75:07.34]I can't arrest her.
[75:07.96]She's stuck on a table.
[75:11.48]You can shoot them in the arms and legs and be a good cop.
[75:13.88]Yeah, but I don't even want to attempt that right now.
[75:15.98]You know what I'm saying?
[75:19.47]That's just dangerous for me.
[75:23.27]Pick up the bat.
[75:23.95]I want to keep the bat.
[75:27.35]I have to hold it forever.
[75:28.99]It's kind of annoying.
[75:32.92]Alright, time to go to the mission.
[75:35.32]Oh, what?
[75:36.04]I can't store that?
[75:37.66]That's stupid.
[75:39.46]I should be able to store it.
[75:40.38]Run on the siren and move people out of the way.
[75:48.99]Alright, story mission.
[75:52.13]Let's get a $20 hot dog to celebrate.
[75:53.87]No, dude, I'm going to blow up.
[76:06.05]Did they blow up?
[76:09.10]Who blew up?
[76:11.56]Okay, they did.
[76:13.74]Yeah, they did.
[76:16.56]Resolve.
[76:19.19]He's shooting the road.
[76:21.83]These games are so much fun.
[76:24.75]It's just total, absolute chaos.
[76:27.92]Domestic dispute.
[76:30.53]It's too fun to just do the random crimes.
[76:32.61]I want to play the regular game, but do I?
[76:34.61]Fuck.
[76:43.23]Ow.
[76:49.64]Okay, are there any bats?
[76:50.64]Is there anything in the trash can I can take?
[76:54.44]Like a baseball bat?
[76:57.08]Alright, domestic dispute.
[76:59.93]Okay, lady with a wrench.
[77:01.63]You ain't gonna come at me with a wrench, lady.
[77:07.81]Give me that wrench.
[77:08.61]You too?
[77:09.83]You going to jail too?
[77:10.73]She had a wrench.
[77:11.27]I don't know what you were doing in here.
[77:13.67]I'll bring you in for questioning.
[77:20.39]Yeah.
[77:21.91]What else you got in here?
[77:22.55]Let's do a little bit of police detective investigation.
[77:26.11]Tool belt.
[77:27.49]Piano.
[77:29.68]Uh...
[77:31.25]Had a radio stove.
[77:33.91]Nobody in the bedroom.
[77:34.67]Nobody hiding in here.
[77:35.49]Computer.
[77:35.97]She probably found the emails.
[77:38.41]Probably found the secret emails.
[77:39.51]I just threw that out the window.
[77:42.07]Can I punch through the window?
[77:48.09]No.
[77:51.61]Okay, goodbye.
[77:53.49]We didn't even need to do anything.
[77:55.03]I had an opportunity to use violence.
[77:58.59]I announced my entrance.
[78:01.26]Wrench lady put the wrench down?
[78:02.80]What was that?
[78:04.14]I thought that guy had a weapon.
[78:13.07]Okay, just making sure.
[78:13.97]What's the conversation?
[78:17.11]Attack on a bus.
[78:18.05]Watch out.
[78:18.67]That's not the bus.
[78:28.67]Do I have to get on the bus and fight on the bus?
[78:30.51]I hope so.
[78:30.91]How is this a bus?
[78:32.06]Well, this is a bus.
[78:33.70]Everybody, stop it.
[78:34.38]Well, okay, who's got the weapon?
[78:35.64]This guy.
[78:36.20]Get that bat and just start hammering people.
[78:55.20]You guys are making it look easy.
[79:04.02]This is great.
[79:05.57]Why would a cop do this?
[79:09.99]Why would you need to do this as a police officer?
[79:13.11]You killed...
[79:19.53]This guy's eyes are bleeding.
[79:22.59]Who's left?
[79:23.47]Alright, you're all done.
[79:24.67]Wait, there's still people fighting.
[79:29.32]Oh, they're all back there.
[79:31.92]Alright, it's fine.
[79:33.10]I'll pick up the crowbar next.
[79:38.14]There, crowbar.
[79:39.10]Let's see if I can make something happen here.
[79:43.20]Alright, almost.
[79:45.33]Oh, god damn it.
[79:47.01]Come on.
[79:48.61]I gotta make a good throw here.
[79:49.73]No, what are you... Get out of the car!
[79:52.67]Alright, last guy.
[79:59.82]He's right there.
[80:03.85]Okay, I love that you can throw shit.
[80:06.97]I just gotta line it up correctly.
[80:10.09]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[80:13.01]Right in the head.
[80:15.61]Oh, come on.
[80:17.13]He dodged that?
[80:17.83]Really?
[80:19.47]I don't believe that for a second.
[80:22.42]Come on, dude.
[80:23.24]Really?
[80:23.50]No, don't hurt me, please!
[80:33.22]He's not going anywhere.
[80:35.62]He ain't going.
[80:35.96]He's an idiot.
[80:36.60]He's not going anywhere.
[80:37.80]Police, I need to check the trunk.
[80:44.18]No, no, no.
[80:44.64]Check the trunk.
[80:45.36]Get in the car.
[80:48.01]He dove out of the car.
[80:53.81]Oh, no, you don't.
[80:55.51]Alright.
[80:55.97]I've had enough.
[80:57.27]You're under arrest.
[80:58.37]I hope you got a good lawyer, man.
[81:01.33]One more guy down here.
[81:02.60]What?
[81:03.98]Is it the lady in the bus?
[81:09.90]What in the hell?
[81:16.27]Oh, shit.
[81:24.73]That was way more graphic than I thought it was going to be.
[81:30.17]She was trying to get away.
[81:31.15]She was running people over.
[81:33.89]I had to do this.
[81:34.51]She was killing people.
[81:36.83]She was running people over with her bus.
[81:40.09]It said there was a bus theft.
[81:42.01]Who's talking?
[81:53.57]Oh, this guy's chasing this guy.
[81:56.87]This guy's been running around in a circle screaming the whole time.
[82:01.93]Is he going to catch him?
[82:02.85]Police!
[82:05.57]Stop right there!
[82:07.06]They actually have been running around in a circle the whole time.
[82:10.02]That's incredible.
[82:13.38]Freeze!
[82:14.10]Police!
[82:15.18]That is incredible.
[82:16.68]He's never going to catch him.
[82:18.44]Wait, did he?
[82:19.74]Police!
[82:20.44]Stop right there!
[82:23.18]Oh, they went in here.
[82:24.26]Okay.
[82:24.88]Well, thanks for being my guide.
[82:26.22]He's trying to blend in.
[82:33.76]Look at his eyes.
[82:35.10]Okay.
[82:35.52]He doesn't know that I can see him.
[82:38.34]Just take this very, very cautiously and very calmly.
[82:47.28]Okay.
[82:49.04]Alright.
[82:49.50]Alright.
[82:49.83]That's all it took.
[82:52.01]You're under arrest.
[82:56.23]Arrest.
[82:59.35]There.
[83:01.87]Okay.
[83:07.05]Thank you for your cooperation.
[83:09.22]The law respects you.
[83:12.72]That's not gonna explode, is it?
[83:16.62]Do TVs explode?
[83:20.01]They're so desperately trying to get out.
[83:24.41]Look, I don't know why this is happening.
[83:26.97]Maybe if we went one at a time.
[83:31.77]Get me out.
[83:32.85]They still can't figure it out.
[83:33.73]That guy's too fat to go through the door.
[83:34.96]I don't think that anything in here can... Alright, what if I just vandalize the whole place?
[83:46.70]Can I get in trouble for this?
[83:48.28]I'm not gonna get in trouble for this, right?
[83:58.58]I just wrecked the whole store.
[84:01.87]That's what you get.
[84:04.65]Your sale was only 5%.
[84:07.01]Should have been 20.
[84:14.78]Okay, let's go.
[84:16.70]Bye.
[84:20.59]I'm helping.
[84:21.25]What?
[84:22.51]What's going on?
[84:24.19]Uh, that was odd, but okay, let's do the mission.
[84:26.73]I'm done.
[84:27.03]I'm not doing any more random little side missions.
[84:31.48]As fun as they are, we're just gonna go right to the mission.
[84:35.36]Nothing else.
[84:47.75]We are going to run into that guy, though.
[84:49.25]Because if they're on a motorcycle, that's the rule in open world driving police games.
[84:53.23]Don't you understand?
[84:54.75]Any game where you can drive a car and there's somebody else that rides on a motorcycle, you are actually obligated to run into them.
[85:00.43]Every time.
[85:00.89]No matter what the situation is, always make sure it happens.
[85:05.06]There's not one time in any open world driving game where I haven't driven into the guy on the motorcycle.
[85:11.47]Hello, Detective.
[85:13.04]Gabriel Whiting, FBI.
[85:15.16]Is that Christopher Walken again?
[85:18.86]Oh, Mr. Hotshot.
[85:20.00]It is.
[85:20.46]He's a different character in this game.
[85:21.74]Kick off my shoes, have a nice cup of cocoa because it sounds like you've got the case figured out.
[85:27.62]Would I be here if I did?
[85:29.70]educate me indeed he was in the last game as a different person with the ocu trying to take down New York's top crime syndicates but things always go wrong stakeouts go cold covers get blown sounds like you just suck at your job
[85:46.40]I was on the job when the best part of you was running down your mother's leg, detective, anyway.
[85:52.05]We figured there's gotta be a mole in the department.
[85:54.73]Detective Higgins was onto something.
[85:57.29]He had evidence.
[85:59.01]Was ready to name names.
[86:00.23]No, it's not the same guy.
[86:01.09]He was so old in the last game.
[86:03.77]So what the fuck happened?
[86:05.27]There's obviously a conspiracy.
[86:07.03]A player set up.
[86:08.63]I believe you can help me find out who's behind it.
[86:11.36]Now, how you figure that?
[86:12.82]Terry Higgins.
[86:14.76]He asked me to bring you in should anything go wrong.
[86:18.22]I want to know the motherfuckers as much as anybody.
[86:20.34]I'm sorry.
[86:21.56]I ain't even got a hunch.
[86:22.58]I just delayed.
[86:25.06]Just delayed reaction.
[86:27.64]I just thought of me getting hit and turning into a firework again.
[86:30.44]Wow.
[86:30.52]You got to do this alone outside of your official duties.
[86:34.62]I just saw a flash of images and it was that.
[86:37.08]No support.
[86:38.18]You were arrested.
[86:39.08]That was like 25 minutes ago.
[86:40.44]After this investigation, I'll make sure they do not pass go.
[86:44.86]Gather enough evidence on the mole.
[86:46.62]We will bury him.
[86:48.74]I haven't had a moment to sit and think about it.
[86:51.28]I just did.
[86:52.66]And I laughed at him again.
[86:54.62]We know that these four crime syndicates have been in contact with the mole.
[86:59.33]You shake them down, you will find Terry's killer.
[87:03.31]I've collected some details.
[87:04.83]Rather scanty, I'm afraid, but they should get you started.
[87:10.91]Old material.
[87:11.87]He's already gone.
[87:14.49]That's a go.
[87:15.33]That's happened to me at least a dozen times in this game so far.
[87:18.04]I feel you, man.
[87:19.24]People just disappear.
[87:25.51]The Magdalena Cartel is the city's prime coke syndicate.
[87:29.71]Even conservative estimates have these guys running 75% of the five boroughs flow.
[87:35.03]It's a shadowy organization, leadership unknown, but we're certain that the top dog lives in Manhattan so as he can keep a close eye on distribution.
[87:45.01]Now, before Terry died, he said he made the acquaintance of one Teresa Castillo, known around the town as Mother Teresa.
[87:53.80]I met the real Mother Teresa once on a mission in Cambodia.
[87:57.36]You'd never know it by looking at her, but a very funny woman, I should write a book.
[88:02.87]Anyway, this Teresa Castillo, she's a rich socialite, runs shelters all over the city.
[88:09.83]Terry believed she had information to help us crack this podcast.
[88:14.07]Go back and look at the shape.
[88:15.29]That was like New Hampshire.
[88:16.31]In Spanish Harlem.
[88:17.81]Alright, let's go get some info.
[88:24.22]Jax.
[88:24.44]Save game.
[88:26.10]Accept.
[88:27.28]Yes.
[88:27.84]Yes.
[88:28.52]Yes.
[88:30.60]Alright.
[88:31.52]Locate the clinic.
[88:32.28]Let's get some... Okay.
[88:35.58]Locate the clinic.
[88:36.26]Let's get something done here.
[88:37.58]Stop!
[88:37.94]Police!
[88:49.10]Get out of the way.
[88:50.10]I wish there was a way I could just move you with my telekinetic ability.
[88:53.52]Okay, let's go.
[88:55.35]Assault on a financial consultant.
[89:00.39]We don't really have time for that.
[89:03.77]You like that PogChamp moment?
[89:04.97]How about that PogChamp moment?
[89:05.99]How about those PogChamps?
[89:06.81]How about this PogChamp moment?
[89:08.29]Huh?
[89:08.99]That was at least five attempts in a row for you to see a pogchampable moment.
[89:13.75]Driving towards traffic, moving, dodging, weaving every car.
[89:17.53]Meant to hit that guy.
[89:21.79]Ten bad, fuck.
[89:28.21]Okay, there's definitely a better way I can go about doing this.
[89:41.78]What is that thing?
[89:42.80]I kind of want that.
[89:44.89]Well, it's already gone.
[89:48.03]I think it took off.
[89:55.91]Straight ahead.
[89:58.41]I really am better off driving on the sidewalk.
[90:01.27]No, don't put the gun down.
[90:08.52]I don't know how to put it away.
[90:09.50]Shift?
[90:12.14]I don't know.
[90:13.42]Just gonna stay out, apparently.
[90:16.80]Move, motherfuckers!
[90:17.82]Police!
[90:18.75]This car sucks.
[90:19.41]I mean, it does, but... What are you gonna do?
[90:24.89]Do I have to drive the wrong way every single time?
[90:27.13]This is the most direct route to get to the destination.
[90:33.05]This is the direct route.
[90:37.03]See?
[90:37.23]You're gonna say, don't drive over there!
[90:39.21]Damn!
[90:44.42]I can't drive up that.
[90:48.12]I bounced back and flattened that guy.
[90:52.40]Nice rubber car.
[90:56.20]Get out of the way.
[91:03.08]Here we go.
[91:06.44]Pancaked him.
[91:08.76]This is the most direct route.
[91:09.95]It just turned into a rubber...
[91:15.85]Can I drive through the gate?
[91:17.98]Can I drive through the gate?
[91:18.94]Yes, I can.
[91:21.24]Now, here comes the hot pursuit.
[91:23.84]Move, move!
[91:25.90]They're all getting in the same car.
[91:28.39]Well, you just made this real easy for me.
[91:33.53]Oh, shit.
[91:34.21]If you move, I'm gonna fuck you up.
[91:38.83]They're all gonna get in a different car.
[91:41.11]They're all trying- They're gonna get in the line.
[91:42.87]They're gonna steal every car in the line.
[91:45.54]Oh, no they're not.
[91:46.14]There they are.
[91:46.60]Look at this.
[91:47.82]Guys, you can't- You're not gonna be able to go anywhere.
[91:51.16]Where are you gonna go?
[91:53.92]You're in traffic.
[91:55.14]They're gonna do the same thing.
[91:57.35]Give me your car, your keys, and get your ass out.
[92:05.23]They're gonna get away.
[92:06.85]Go down hard or easy.
[92:07.97]Your choice.
[92:11.63]What the fuck?
[92:12.17]Why?
[92:12.39]Why did you get out of the car?
[92:14.43]I don't know why you got out of the car.
[92:20.27]What was that all about?
[92:24.04]Don't make this hard on yourself, dude.
[92:27.26]I had no choice.
[92:28.08]What was my choice there?
[92:28.88]Stay down.
[92:45.19]Alright, back to normal.
[92:50.85]What was that noise?
[92:53.66]Did you hear that?
[92:55.60]What is going on right now?
[92:56.68]Is the T-Rex in Manhattan right now?
[93:02.06]The ground was shaking.
[93:03.14]There's a dinosaur in New York.
[93:17.85]Get away from the flashing.
[93:21.10]Get away from the flashing lights.
[93:24.36]Here we go.
[93:24.88]True crime, Jurassic Park.
[93:26.60]There's an owl now.
[93:44.37]Where's the owl?
[93:49.92]Is this turning into a horror movie?
[93:51.30]Alright, this is the car I had before.
[93:54.16]We're not going to do that.
[93:54.92]We're going to go this way.
[93:56.48]Well, I missed, but... See, there's the Jurassic Park tour guide.
[94:06.10]What the heck?
[94:14.98]No, we're not doing it.
[94:16.01]We're doing the actual mission.
[94:22.43]See?
[94:22.81]Not driving on the wrong side of the road.
[94:24.17]Not driving on the right side of the road.
[94:25.57]Going right in the middle where it's impossible to get in a car accident.
[94:28.19]This is what the speedrunners do.
[94:31.62]I've seen the GTA 2, GTA 3, and 4 speedrun.
[94:34.18]They do it right in the median.
[94:35.92]So they don't have to weave anywhere.
[94:36.94]They can just very gently drive through the whole thing.
[94:40.78]Never get in any car accidents.
[94:41.96]Never get in any stoppage.
[94:42.94]They just stay right in the middle.
[94:48.87]Nice parking job.
[94:50.29]Is that how you get to work?
[94:53.86]That's how you get to work the fastest.
[94:57.48]Here we go.

[97:32.78]Insta-killed.
[97:35.08]I don't know what happened.
[97:36.08]I have no idea.
[97:37.94]I wish I could tell you what I just did.
[97:39.20]I don't know.
[97:40.64]Somehow both of them died.
[97:46.46]No, no, no, no, no.
[97:47.38]Why are you walking forward?

[98:16.54]Got him.
[98:18.52]Aimbotting.
[98:19.08]I'm not aimbotting.
[98:24.22]Where are they going to come from?
[98:28.71]Left or right?
[98:34.47]Who's left?
[98:37.13]Money?
[98:38.34]Collect evidence.
[98:39.28]Found evidence.
[98:40.02]Drug paraphernalia.
[98:40.84]One of seven.
[98:42.76]Pack of drugs.
[98:44.10]Can I pick each individually?
[98:46.78]Large pack of fake money.
[98:48.30]Oh, come on.
[98:49.24]Fake money.
[98:51.17]Don't do this shit to me.
[98:52.11]Give me fake cash.
[98:53.19]What about the... I can pick up these drugs, right?
[98:56.73]This eighth grade science experiment.
[98:58.27]Can I get this?
[99:00.73]You sure I can't pick up the funny thing from Beakman's lab?
[99:06.33]There's more shit.
[99:06.87]I gotta pick up everything in here, right?
[99:12.94]I'm gonna leave the area, aren't I?
[99:16.62]Make sure I didn't miss anything.
[99:17.54]No, nothing else in there.
[99:23.64]It turns out they were just playing Monopoly, that's it.
[99:26.91]They're playing Monopoly and collecting cans of flammable liquid.
[99:31.93]Look at this.
[99:32.31]Wanna see some police detective work?
[99:36.69]Why would you keep these?
[99:37.57]Oh, give me a shotgun.
[99:45.04]This is a very skinny door.
[99:46.64]It is.
[99:49.10]That dilly?
[99:55.02]He ain't coming back.
[99:56.45]You got my word on that.
[99:58.74]I have to say, you have a rare determination for a cop.
[100:02.26]You're going to need it.
[100:03.96]The cartel is an army.
[100:05.40]You mean the Magdalenas?
[100:07.17]Magdalenas, the Lords, the Curls.
[100:09.67]Many names, same source.
[100:11.47]A major crack processing facility right here in the city.
[100:15.31]So how do I find him?
[100:16.65]I've been funding the Smith Projects in Alphabet City.
[100:19.47]I can tell you this.
[100:20.81]Three times a day, a motorcycle courier supplies the stoop dealers and collects their cash.
[100:26.64]Sounds like a run of where I'm from.
[100:28.71]piece of advice go get him grab yourself a motorbike or you'll lose him he takes a route no police car could follow alright oh don't make me have to weave around on a motorcycle I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble game saved locate the projects okay with a motorcycle we got an illegal street racing circuit in the city
[100:56.95]We know they have scouts cruising the streets in your area, challenging cars to race.
[101:01.70]I want you undercover on this.
[101:03.48]Once you get in, stay on it until you get to the champ.
[101:06.06]I thought the mayor cleaned this shit up.
[101:07.88]Now you watch yourself.
[101:08.72]Good luck.
[101:09.22]Watch where you're going, moron.
[101:12.56]OK, so the city can do street racing now?
[101:14.96]New York fucking police.
[101:17.59]Yeah, we definitely are at least like 20% faster than we should be.
[101:21.05]Yeah, found evidence.
[101:21.61]You're under arrest.
[101:22.35]Give me that car.
[101:47.44]Same strategy.
[101:48.62]He's just dead.
[101:49.60]We need a bike, apparently, though.
[101:52.00]Found one.
[101:54.64]You little snake!
[101:57.68]Wow.
[102:02.60]Slow that down.
[102:04.82]And put a gas mask on the guy.
[102:08.34]And you got Darth Vader.
[102:11.63]He's gone.
[102:12.71]Whatever.
[102:21.08]I was like, I can't... I'm just causing destruction.
[102:25.58]It is an open world driving game, so all trees are cement bricks.
[102:38.09]Yeah, I'm not sure if the more frames is making this funnier or if it's worse.
[102:44.18]It's actually hard for me to determine that.
[102:47.22]I think it's pretty fun, actually.
[102:49.82]It's almost like we're playing the game on hard mode.
[102:51.56]Huh?
[103:01.27]What's going on?
[103:01.97]Where am I?
[103:19.28]Get off me.
[103:20.34]Get off me.
[103:21.09]I got places to be, man.
[103:31.45]Just seriously, Mortal Kombat uppercut me.
[103:33.39]Oh, what?
[103:41.09]Block it, just block.
[103:43.41]Get off me.

[104:10.71]What is going on with the terrain?
[104:14.39]Where's this- Oh, it's this guy.
[104:18.45]He doesn't have a health bar or anything.
[104:21.23]He's hiding.
[104:47.35]What happened in the last game?
[105:00.00]Got him.
[105:00.24]You're under arrest.
[105:07.09]You're under arrest!
[105:12.49]Well, you should have thought about that before you started punching me.
[105:21.65]Okay, need a new car.
[105:23.23]Anybody got a car I can take?
[105:38.50]That reverse speed was regular driving speed.
[105:43.20]Fighting bums.
[105:44.06]Here we go.
[105:44.49]Here comes a guy.
[105:45.71]They're all got bats.
[105:46.89]Let the hostage go?
[105:47.75]What's this cop doing?
[106:04.89]Where is it?
[106:05.27]I gotta pick it up.
[106:06.55]Where's the bat?
[106:07.43]I want to throw the bat at him.
[106:11.73]Give me the other bat.
[106:14.15]Here we go.
[106:14.55]Give me the bat.
[106:19.37]This guy's killing me.
[106:20.69]This guy's a master.
[106:23.23]Alright, here we go.
[106:25.95]God damn it.
[106:34.83]Just arrest him.
[106:38.25]Arrest the other guy, please.
[106:41.75]Why are you even... What are you doing?
[106:43.73]Don't aim the gun at me, dude.
[106:45.45]Why are you pointing at me?
[106:46.21]Am I under arrest?
[106:46.88]What were you... What are you doing?
[106:47.86]I had to do that.
[106:48.50]What is... Give me this...
[106:59.98]What the fuck, man?
[107:02.62]Why?
[107:03.12]Don't do this.
[107:08.29]I'm one of you.
[107:09.75]Don't you see?
[107:11.05]Don't you know who I am?
[107:12.09]Wait, flash the badge.
[107:16.53]That's right, the badge.
[107:17.35]I have a badge.
[107:17.71]Wow, that actually worked.
[107:19.57]One time, asshole.
[107:20.59]It's under control.
[107:22.37]Okay.
[107:36.71]What are you doing?
[107:37.93]Why is he attacking?
[107:39.89]What is this guy doing?
[107:41.93]Why is he shooting me?
[107:44.87]Oh, come on.
[107:48.84]Just take me.
[107:49.32]Where am I going?
[107:50.12]Take me to the...
[108:02.82]Get out of here.
[108:04.54]I need to go over here.
[108:05.60]Just get out.
[108:06.64]No, get... Get out.
[108:13.62]Stop the red lights.
[108:16.97]No, it's called, I said I was a cop.
[108:18.63]He goes, whoa, you're a cop?
[108:19.67]Whoa!
[108:21.01]And then he turned into a character from Twisted Metal and started shooting me.
[108:24.57]I thought he was shooting at somebody else.
[108:27.75]There was no reason for him to be firing me.
[108:34.47]We're almost there.
[108:36.35]Not much further now.
[108:47.56]You know, playing... If I fix this... Let's say we stream... You stream.
[108:51.24]Let's say I stream this again.
[108:53.84]Like Thursday, right?
[108:56.65]You know how strange this is gonna be if I get the fix and we play an actually in like 30, 50, 60 frames a second?
[109:05.62]That's a nice fight.
[109:09.28]I feel like I'm not gonna be able to go back.
[109:10.82]Alright, I need to flash the badge so they know it's me.
[109:12.87]This is a nice one.
[109:17.57]I'm dead on this bike.
[109:19.31]That's a ga- I told- I- I- This is not gonna be- I'm telling you, man.
[109:34.73]It's not gonna be possible.
[109:36.25]It's not gonna be possible.
[109:39.03]This goes way too fast in this mode.
[109:41.36]Oh, just get there.
[109:45.36]This thing is really screwed up.
[109:51.18]I'm in a VR game right now.
[109:52.74]I'm not even kidding.
[109:53.40]I don't know what to do.
[109:55.10]Don't go this fast.
[109:55.76]Just slow it down.
[109:56.88]There's no reason to do this.
[109:57.60]I'm going to die instantly if I crash.
[110:00.24]Plus, we have to go through the park anyways.
[110:12.67]Is that water or is this weird pavement?
[110:15.07]That's water.
[110:15.73]Do not drive in the water.
[110:18.67]1099 T5 vehicle accident escalating to 1034.
[110:22.01]Drivers involved are engaged in violent dispute.
[110:25.15]Over.
[110:26.48]Those cars are going to blow up.
[110:27.30]I'm not going over there.
[110:31.64]That's going to blow up, man.
[110:36.02]I'm not going near that shit.
[110:43.65]Did he not say the F?
[110:49.38]It's only a matter of time, guys.
[110:53.38]Punk-ass bitch.
[110:55.24]You bastard.
[111:01.08]You're under arrest.
[111:04.64]Why are you gonna come after me?
[111:05.82]How do you even know what I'm doing here?
[111:14.48]What is he holding?
[111:15.22]Is that a screwdriver?
[111:16.24]Is that what I think it is?
[111:18.34]What in the hell?
[111:20.09]Is that a knife?
[111:23.54]I'm gonna get on the car.
[111:25.14]Let's make this hard.
[111:25.82]Let's make this real easy for him.
[111:28.26]Okay, this is where I gotta- I gotta get my exit here.
[111:30.06]Exit!
[111:31.10]EXIT!
[111:38.68]I just saw legs and arms.
[111:41.07]Okay, bye.
[111:41.63]I'm immune.
[111:52.08]Hey, slow down!
[111:52.90]Oh fuck, slow, slow it!
[112:00.82]I don't know, they were coming up this road.
[112:07.41]How was I supposed to know they were gonna do that?
[112:08.99]There's no bus here.
[112:16.99]How is this a bus?
[112:20.86]That's what I like to see, yeah!
[112:23.92]That's what I like to see, yeah!
[112:25.56]I wish I had grenades right now, I really do.
[112:31.16]Ow!
[112:31.96]That's what I like to see, yeah!
[112:37.91]I don't know what to do about this.
[112:38.95]Should I go over here and flash the badge?
[112:40.41]I need to find a way to do this without causing that much of a problem.
[112:45.94]I don't care about this guy.
[112:47.24]No, I don't want to take the... What?
[112:48.76]In the name of God?
[112:49.58]Why is there so many people up here?
[113:04.57]What's going on?
[113:05.95]They're all drinking.
[113:06.95]These are all drunk ladies.
[113:10.51]I don't know what to do about this.
[113:13.85]I think I'm gonna have to... Let's just...
[113:25.69]Everybody calm down.
[113:31.18]Break it up.
[113:32.46]I don't even know who's doing that, but they're in trouble.
[113:35.58]You're in trouble.
[113:36.14]Get up.
[113:36.38]Put it down.
[113:36.94]Okay.
[113:37.26]You asked for it.
[113:38.50]Right in the hand.
[113:40.03]Good cop.
[113:42.61]What about you?
[113:52.08]Good God.
[113:54.04]I got him in the heart.
[113:55.10]It's okay.
[113:55.62]How are you still even living?
[113:57.98]I don't know.
[114:01.36]I can't do that to him anymore.
[114:09.65]This game is one level above a shitty Android game.
[114:17.29]That is a strong person.
[114:18.47]Screw Dixon.
[114:19.25]This shit's for me.
[114:25.44]Good cop.
[114:28.42]That was out of nowhere.
[114:30.34]What was the point of that?
[114:51.26]What?
[114:52.02]There's always a fire truck.
[114:53.88]Why?
[114:55.35]Oh, fiddlesticks.
[115:02.71]I'm just running this guy over.
[115:03.91]I'm just gonna make his life a living.
[115:07.30]The last few moments of your life are gonna be terrifying.
[115:11.78]You think you can outrun the car?
[115:12.84]He thinks he's... I think I'm outrunning it.
[115:14.38]I think I'm doing a good job outrunning the car.
[115:16.71]No, please, I don't want... Don't do this to me.
[115:18.59]I just was selling drugs.
[115:19.89]I... The last few moments of your life I wanted to be total terror.
[115:28.24]Oh, that was fucking sick.
[115:44.00]Get me out of here.
[115:50.52]I have no control.
[115:51.30]I'm just... It's fake control.
[115:53.50]We're okay.
[115:59.55]I didn't have any control at all.
[116:00.73]Zero.
[116:02.99]I got five seconds.
[116:04.03]I think I can do five seconds doing this on this road.
[116:07.37]Here we go.
[116:07.97]Start the timer.
[116:09.03]Now one.
[116:10.19]Two.
[116:11.17]Three.
[116:12.29]Four.
[116:13.37]Five.
[116:14.45]Six.
[116:15.47]Seven.
[116:16.41]Eight.
[116:17.33]Did it.
[116:17.65]Eight seconds.
[116:18.53]Ten seconds.
[116:18.99]We're going fine now.
[116:20.81]Slow.
[116:21.45]Slow.
[116:21.69]Slow.
[116:24.49]It's a miracle I haven't crashed into something.
[116:31.62]Alright.
[116:35.96]I'm going the wrong way.
[116:37.10]Down here.
[116:37.52]Straight away.
[116:42.49]I'm not even looking at the road.
[116:43.33]My head's just down.
[116:45.83]If I get hit, it's going to be bad news.
[116:48.89]But I do have a motorcycle.
[116:49.97]That's what they recommended.
[116:50.91]I'm just kind of close.
[116:55.31]Why am I playing this to get on the yellow line?
[117:03.46]Dangerous waters.
[117:09.72]That's stomping on a dime.
[117:12.80]I want to go into this Thomas Jefferson statue.
[117:16.30]I'm sorry, everybody.
[117:17.18]This has to happen.
[117:17.92]I have to go 1,000 miles per hour into Thomas Jefferson.
[117:22.90]You don't think that I have to do this?
[117:25.62]Nice brakes.
[117:26.82]Alright, here we go.
[117:28.22]See you later.
[117:45.32]I had some resistance.
[117:48.86]I had some resistance.
[117:50.68]I'll try it again.
[117:51.38]I don't think I can.
[117:53.00]I guess I can.
[117:56.12]Okay, I'm good.
[118:11.93]What is that thing?
[118:19.25]What are the ruby slippers over here?
[118:22.15]I gotta get the ruby slippers.
[118:25.11]What are these Sonic the Hedgehog power-ups?
[118:30.45]He found another Puma shoe.
[118:33.04]Did you get that license plate?
[118:36.45]Alright, we're almost there.
[118:37.81]Subway's right here.
[118:38.93]I can ride the subway, right?
[118:42.51]What's wrong with everybody?
[118:44.45]Oh, you can take the subway.
[118:53.63]Oh, okay.
[118:54.07]Well, the train goes that way.
[118:55.85]Does the train keep going?
[118:56.61]I mean, obviously we need to know if it's possible, right?
[119:00.29]Of course it is.
[119:01.11]Wow!
[119:02.71]I thought I was gonna dodge it!
[119:04.34]Wowie!
[119:06.37]Oh, wow.
[119:07.79]Wow.
[119:10.41]Oh, fuck this.
[119:10.95]We're not doing this.
[119:15.19]Wow.
[119:17.83]Nice shitty cat impression.
[119:19.11]All units, gang activity heavy gunfire reported.
[119:21.25]Officer in trouble.
[119:22.17]Another officer down.
[119:24.48]Motherfucker.
[119:24.94]Don't make me have to subdue you.
[119:27.24]Oh, shit.
[119:30.72]Make more ground.
[119:31.90]Advance.
[119:40.03]What is he doing?
[119:46.25]Why does he have explosive bullets?
[119:51.40]Alright, he's done.
[119:53.58]Everything's fine.
[119:59.88]No, we're not fine.
[120:01.52]Am I actually... You're actually gonna shoot at me like this.
[120:05.70]No, you're not.
[120:06.24]Are you?
[120:07.38]Why would you... I don't understand.
[120:08.84]I'm a cop.
[120:10.14]See?
[120:10.36]What the hell?
[120:11.84]What the heck?
[120:12.64]What the hell?
[120:14.26]I can't get in there.
[120:26.24]What the heck?
[120:27.00]What the heck?
[120:27.54]What the heck?
[120:28.18]What the heck?
[120:29.20]What the heck?
[120:33.39]Alright, back to what we were doing.
[120:35.21]Oh, what?
[120:38.53]What?
[120:38.79]Right.
[120:41.37]Straight away down here, and we should be there.
[120:45.05]Please move.
[120:47.99]By any means necessary, we have a issue.
[120:50.65]No, we're doing the actual quest.
[120:57.82]Always wear your seatbelt.
[120:58.60]That guy flew out.
[121:01.50]Let that be a lesson to all of you.
[121:08.70]This is far away.
[121:09.56]That guy's wearing a seatbelt.
[121:19.29]Good.
[121:22.91]Why is he at the top?
[121:29.80]I think they're all frozen in time.
[121:33.58]This guy's frozen.
[121:35.21]He's in slow motion.
[121:38.61]This guy is in slow motion.
[121:41.71]That's incredible.
[121:43.97]Why is this guy in slow motion?
[121:49.59]Is he doing a bit?
[121:51.39]He's doing a joke?
[121:53.37]Or is he just this old?
[122:01.08]Kidding me.
[122:02.90]Is he gonna die in slow motion?
[122:07.27]Oh god, I hope so.
[122:10.91]You can make it.
[122:12.99]The turtle versus the hare.
[122:14.17]Keep coming.
[122:15.29]Yeah, I know it's tough being old.
[122:29.38]These people are so antsy I don't care how long it takes we have to see the tortoise cross the street You can time-lapse this if you want if you're watching the VOD I'm not leaving until this guy gets to the other side
[122:58.52]I'm not gonna help him.
[122:59.86]He doesn't need help.
[123:08.46]Why do I keep focusing on him?
[123:09.90]Focus on him!
[123:13.02]Somebody's gonna get so impatient.
[123:16.59]And if he dies in slow motion, then that might be the end of me.
[123:25.94]Walk into him.
[123:26.54]I don't want to break it.
[123:28.74]We have a unicorn here, guys.
[123:30.48]And there's a potential for this just to... I could touch him and it might turn him back to normal.
[123:35.86]The red van is going to run into him.
[123:38.14]That's a guarantee.
[123:42.77]The red van is so antsy.
[123:44.23]I have to move backwards and to the right and he'll get hit.
[123:49.91]Oh, here we go.
[123:50.93]No.
[123:51.09]I thought the cop car was going to go.
[123:56.63]Do bits in the meantime.
[123:58.07]Oh my god.
[123:58.77]Never trust a purple gate.
[123:59.63]$50.
[123:59.73]I can't alt-tab.
[124:03.37]I'll take a look at it in two seconds.
[124:04.95]Thank you so much, dude.
[124:06.93]That was at least a few minutes ago.
[124:20.32]Where is he going, though?
[124:21.44]Where is he off to?
[124:24.84]The taxi is getting really irritated.
[124:27.73]The AI does not know what to do.
[124:32.51]The funny thing about this is... Imagine this is a real life situation.
[124:37.37]This is probably what would happen.
[124:39.23]You're in the middle of New York.
[124:40.27]Some old ass guy is doing this.
[124:42.37]Walking not even a mile per hour.
[124:44.53]Everyone's trying to get places.
[124:46.53]This would happen.
[124:48.19]Easy.
[124:48.81]Easy.
[124:55.35]Okay, we have a problem because here comes the gang members over here on the top left.
[124:59.02]This is not good.
[124:59.58]They're coming over here with bats.
[125:02.58]If I stand here long enough, they will make their way down here with baseball bats.
[125:05.40]This is not what I want.
[125:08.40]Random crime throughout the city is going to cause our watching the old guy cross the street impossible.
[125:12.54]I thought that was a dog.
[125:22.71]No.
[125:26.00]Defend grandpa once he gets in that spot in the way of the red car This is the key to everything I have to make sure I get a good view of it Imagine the impatience here we go all it takes is one excuse you here it comes oh
[125:52.25]Slowly making his way into the field of view of the impatient lady in the red SUV.
[126:05.45]He could get out of the way.
[126:06.31]Is he going slower?
[126:11.17]I might need to move the car.
[126:19.20]I'm gonna move this car.
[126:23.63]We need to have a best opportunity for something to happen.
[126:25.39]I have to move.
[126:30.41]How many more cars do we need to move?
[126:34.57]Alright, this car has to move.
[126:36.31]No, don't, don't, don't!
[126:37.19]Get out!
[126:37.57]Get out!
[126:38.38]You stupid!
[126:39.14]Okay, thank god he's still there.
[126:43.74]Here we go.
[126:48.50]Here it comes.
[126:52.50]The lady's going to get impatient.
[126:53.92]She's going to step on the gas.
[127:03.25]No!
[127:04.17]He's back to normal.
[127:04.89]Why?
[127:09.61]Why are you back to normal?
[127:16.37]I broke it.
[127:17.39]I broke it because I hit the car.
[127:19.61]Oh, god damn it.
[127:26.63]Now you can move!
[127:42.54]Oh, I'm so irritated by that.
[127:45.82]That sucks.
[127:46.86]Oh, goddammit.
[127:48.04]Oh well.
[127:49.03]I knew if I touched anything, but I had to.
[127:53.83]Fuck.
[127:54.35]It's alright.
[127:54.95]God damn it.
[127:55.56]It was funny for a second.
[127:57.32]I'm so annoyed by that.
[127:58.30]I think it's a sledgehammer.
[128:04.32]I don't have a badge anymore.
[128:10.94]Why do I not have a badge?
[128:13.58]Let's see what it's doing in here.
[128:20.70]What is going on?
[128:21.94]Am I holding something?
[128:27.50]I want the sledgehammer.
[128:31.42]I think my character might be stuck in something weird here.
[128:34.84]All I can do is... I'm trying to throw something.
[128:40.45]See what I'm talking about?
[128:42.01]I don't really... I don't have anything.
[128:45.29]Why am I doing the throw animation?
[128:46.53]You're going to catch my licking stick now.
[128:52.82]I don't have a gun.
[128:56.67]I'm aiming it with a fake gun.
[128:58.59]What the fuck is going on?
[129:06.17]I don't have a gun.
[129:09.78]Something is not right.
[129:13.92]This is not right.
[129:18.64]This is incorrect.
[129:20.48]And I'm not sure there's anything... I think I have to die.
[129:22.24]Um... Get that guy out of here.
[129:35.17]Okay, take... We're gonna take care of this guy.
[129:41.23]No, don't... I don't want to get in the car.
[129:42.81]Oh, no.
[129:43.07]What is going...
[129:44.01]What?! !
[129:51.91]Did somebody just fall off the building?
[129:57.48]Get him out of this car.
[129:59.86]Okay, please give me my controls back.
[130:07.71]I still can't do Q. I have to die.
[130:10.95]Somebody has to kill me.
[130:14.33]I'm stuck in everlasting pretend weapon mode.
[130:21.74]I gotta start a fight with somebody.
[130:26.36]Somebody come after me.
[130:30.46]Somebody has to kill me.
[130:32.26]Somebody kill me.
[130:32.90]Alright, anybody want to fight?
[130:38.33]I'm just gonna run into a wall.
[130:40.45]For Christ's sake.
[130:41.03]Get me out of here.
[130:44.67]Yeah, I can't fire.
[130:48.37]I can't do anything.
[130:48.99]Just crash.
[130:49.63]Somebody run into me.
[130:51.93]Crash.
[130:52.67]There we go.
[130:53.13]Perfect opportunity.
[130:59.12]Okay.
[130:59.32]Alright, last ride here so I can actually get my weapons and items back.
[131:09.74]This is going to be extravagant.
[131:12.14]What's the most extravagant way I can crash?
[131:14.94]To make sure I'm guaranteed to instantly explode.
[131:17.20]Or instantly die.
[131:18.88]There's got to be at least a few ways.
[131:21.24]I'm thinking directly into a brick wall.
[131:23.20]What do you guys think?
[131:27.19]And plus we're making some headway to the next area.
[131:32.47]I'm thinking directly into a wall.
[131:39.87]Okay.
[131:40.57]Do I have access to my stuff?
[131:43.37]No, I don't.
[131:44.89]Did I get my badge taken?
[131:46.22]I don't understand what's going on with my guy.
[131:54.27]I can't do anything.
[131:56.35]I don't have a gun?
[131:58.55]The old fucking man broke my whole game.
[132:09.01]Pick up an item like a bat?
[132:10.31]Yeah, I'll try that.
[132:10.97]Maybe I can re-glitch it.
[132:14.29]What the hell?
[132:27.09]I don't have a badge and I don't have a gun.
[132:28.31]No, no, no.
[132:28.79]Alright, for a second, I'm just a video game loser and I saw Rock Band Wrecking Hotel.
[132:48.39]I'm immediately just thinking that that's a bunch of people playing rock band.
[132:52.75]And they're being too loud and they're fucking up a hotel room.
[132:55.35]Not an actual rock star.
[132:57.33]People playing rock band.
[133:00.55]Look at what, like, social media has done to my brain.
[133:02.85]Get out of the way.
[133:19.75]It's so fast.
[133:25.72]I'm just playing with hacks.
[133:30.90]Hey, well the thing is, the game is gonna go two times as fast, right?
[133:34.55]Isn't that the theory here?
[133:36.61]It takes me half as much time to get somewhere?
[133:49.65]That guy got fucking obliterated.
[133:52.12]Alright, maybe if we do a cutscene I'll get out of this and I can actually do it.
[134:01.88]There we go, fight!
[134:02.64]Here we go!
[134:19.19]Is that all I had to do?
[134:20.53]I win.
[134:24.21]Interrogate.
[134:43.45]Silence ain't getting you nowhere.
[134:45.17]Get your hand off me.
[134:46.21]I can shoot you right now.
[134:47.07]You got a problem?
[134:47.69]None of your- You wanna talk right now?
[134:49.75]You wanna die?
[134:51.07]Get your- Think I won't use this?
[134:52.13]I'll kill you.
[134:53.49]Ah, you- I'll kill you.
[134:54.21]Hey, hey, I'm your messenger, man.
[134:55.33]You can't get a hokey, eh?
[134:56.73]Give me your name or this- I'll fucking kill you.
[134:58.57]I'm strictly about the cash, okay?
[135:00.27]Ain't no crime in carrying cash.
[135:01.95]No, no, no, no, no, eh, eh, eh.
[135:04.19]How'd you like this?
[135:06.08]You remember something?
[135:07.30]Hey, hey, he's the killer.
[135:08.56]I'm just the delivery boy, okay?
[135:10.90]You wanna find Ray?
[135:12.87]At his safe house.
[135:13.95]They're watching a soccer game.
[135:15.05]I'm supposed to bring them a pizza and... Shit, man, if he finds out I talked... Deliver a pizza to this guy?
[135:19.60]It's Columbia necktie for me, man.
[135:21.46]My toe slid and my tongue pulled through it.
[135:24.76]Oh, man, I'm gonna die.
[135:26.44]Right, right.
[135:28.06]I'll look into that.
[135:32.64]Uh-oh, look... Arrested.
[135:34.82]Good call.
[135:41.51]Sometimes you gotta be a good cop, right?
[135:44.60]Hello?
[135:45.32]Hey, hot shot that drug runner we brought in.
[135:47.68]He had a bowel released and passed out.
[135:50.74]I hope you get to follow a more pleasant scent.
[135:53.64]Thank you, first of all.
[135:55.96]What up, Pop?
[135:56.85]Son, I got something very important I need you to do for me.
[135:59.89]Man, I'm in the middle of my own shit.
[136:01.91]You know, like being a detective.
[136:03.63]Then you should have no problem finding your way here.
[136:06.83]Dispatch, the street response... Austin, situation.
[136:18.59]Taken care of.
[136:19.23]You have the right to remain silent.
[136:23.50]Well, you're gonna be permanently silent.
[136:26.06]Job well done.
[136:26.66]Good job, officers.
[136:31.30]I gotta put a pizza in here.
[136:45.32]Turn this way.
[136:47.02]Relax.
[136:48.18]Oh, I was watching chat.
[136:49.26]I looked at chat, and I got scared.
[136:52.34]There's a dog?
[136:53.10]Where's the dog?
[136:53.64]You have a dog in your trunk?
[136:57.97]No, you don't.
[137:05.53]I think that somebody has a novelty car alarm.
[137:09.07]Yeah.
[137:10.35]That's all that is.
[137:12.35]See?
[137:12.63]There goes somebody.
[137:21.90]Straight ahead.
[137:27.70]I love the comment that somebody said.
[137:29.42]Arms dealer.
[137:30.46]Alright, pick up my gun.
[137:31.70]He's dead.
[137:32.14]Holy shit, I died instantly.
[137:34.52]Well, that's what happens, I guess.
[137:36.04]I got my controls back.
[137:38.80]Yeah.
[137:52.02]oh my god fastest I think that's the fastest I've ever died playing the game for sure I just got wrecked I did oh alright
[138:19.64]Good choice.
[138:20.66]Hijack tactic.
[138:21.78]Hijack tactic.
[138:29.77]car like that.
[138:31.25]I'm trying so hard.
[138:32.77]There's so many other ways for me to get away.
[138:37.84]I don't even have a chance.
[138:41.70]Forget it.
[138:42.38]Just go.
[138:43.58]Get out of here.
[138:46.94]The car is fine.
[138:48.32]Why did it explode?
[138:51.76]I love this.
[138:53.84]I love this game.
[138:58.54]Hostage situation at the bank.
[139:00.18]Get in the bank.
[139:03.26]Bank robbery?
[139:05.42]Who?
[139:07.58]Who's the bank robber?
[139:08.20]Is this a bank robber?
[139:09.89]It's this guy right here.
[139:10.53]Nobody's doing anything illegal.
[139:27.67]Who's doing something illegal?
[139:28.99]Oh, it's a lady behind the counter.
[139:32.66]Okay, well... There's just one lady behind the counter.
[139:36.38]I can break this.
[139:39.56]Okay, how do I handle this?
[139:41.52]I don't know how to handle this.
[139:45.19]Easy.
[139:45.41]Easy, don't.
[140:04.74]Taken care of.
[140:13.94]No, I gotta get paid for this.
[140:16.07]Oh, baby.
[140:18.03]Sometimes you gotta get paid for some of the work you do as an officer.
[140:21.05]You know what I'm saying?
[140:21.67]The vault.
[140:23.29]I will enter the vault, please.
[140:31.35]No, I can't.
[140:32.19]I can't take any money?
[140:34.19]Why?
[140:34.41]Where's the button to open the doors?
[140:39.00]Oh, well.
[140:43.42]Ominous.
[140:53.34]They keep giving the fuck you symbol with their hands and I'm saying Do this I'll tell you one thing this game in particular
[141:19.32]It's probably really hard to not get bad cop points.
[141:23.00]You get plus 10 bad cop points if you hit anybody with a car.
[141:29.11]That's an intense situation.
[141:31.17]You have to be very careful.
[141:32.21]There's so many people walking around.
[141:33.79]Look how many people are just always around.
[141:48.06]to the Washington soccer game.
[141:49.16]This is where I come in and I say, you're all in trouble.
[141:52.87]You're all under arrest.
[141:53.53]So I had a pizza the whole time?
[141:54.93]Where did I have that?
[141:59.55]I would love to use the pizza bomb on other occasions.
[142:27.70]Right through the window.
[142:28.84]That's the guy.
[142:39.49]I saved you.
[142:41.25]Don't worry.
[142:42.23]You're going to be safe.
[142:45.61]I got this under control.
[142:47.55]Officer Jax is in the building.
[142:53.64]Jax is back.
[143:01.52]with precision aiming.
[143:12.13]They're all aiming at the door over there.
[143:16.07]They're waiting for me to come through this door, so why not just not do that and shoot the explosives through the window?
[143:31.27]How are you the only guy that died from that?
[143:34.57]That doesn't make any sense.
[143:36.87]You should have... I'm not gonna... Whatever.
[143:39.10]Thank you, guy.
[143:47.20]These flies are seriously bothering me.
[143:50.14]That's the guy I gotta question.
[143:53.02]I need him.
[143:53.52]Give me health.
[143:55.28]I gotta interrogate that guy.
[144:00.90]I'm surrounded by useless fucking people!
[144:04.50]Damn, I need something ill to knock this door down.
[144:08.19]I need something.
[144:08.83]Get out of my life, man.
[144:12.17]Who's shooting?
[144:13.72]Who is shooting?
[144:15.97]I don't want to blow it up.
[144:17.93]One in the head.
[144:18.57]Got it.
[144:19.05]Okay.
[144:20.24]Can I move these crates?
[144:21.80]Can I move these things?
[144:22.62]No?
[144:22.82]What is that?
[144:23.98]I can definitely work with this.
[144:30.16]Well.
[144:37.59]I want another one.
[144:43.08]Let's sneak in here and try to utilize this.
[144:44.62]He's just in the room somewhere, right?
[144:47.81]Looks like someone wants to trip me up.
[144:49.83]Oh, fucking hell.
[144:51.85]This game is so sloppy.
[144:52.91]How am I going to get up?
[144:56.19]Can I... Oh, no.
[144:57.87]I have to jump over it.
[145:01.07]How do you... Oh, boy.
[145:04.32]Is there a thing I can shoot?
[145:05.88]I can't... No, I can't shoot it.
[145:06.90]It's going to blow up.
[145:07.60]I have to jump over it.
[145:08.54]Just do it right.
[145:09.48]Oh, this is so...
[145:13.90]Can I snipe him?
[145:17.92]He's got one and I got one.
[145:22.66]Um.
[145:50.73]Did I just get hit by the sign?
[145:54.37]How am I supposed to interrogate him?
[145:56.87]Okay, alright, alright.
[145:57.67]How is he doing that?
[145:58.62]How are you doing that?
[146:17.57]Help, help, help, help, help, help!
[146:19.65]What's the matter?
[146:20.51]You don't want to catch me no more?
[146:33.38]Die!
[146:34.26]Get him!
[146:35.10]Get... He's shooting blindly.
[146:37.36]He's blind firing with a rocket launcher.
[146:40.12]Dude.
[146:41.80]What's the matter?
[146:42.84]You don't want to catch me no more?
[146:50.40]Shit.
[146:51.08]I have to just do this.
[146:51.78]I don't know when he's firing.
[146:56.53]I don't know when he's firing.
[147:00.25]He blind fires without any sound.
[147:02.31]Got him.
[147:03.13]Get over here.
[147:11.79]You're the head of the Magdalena Cartel, so you better start talking.
[147:16.37]Don't make me the bad guy.
[147:18.25]Remember her name now?
[147:21.33]You want to die?
[147:22.79]This help your memory?
[147:23.91]I got to keep it in the green.
[147:26.23]Magdalena Cartel, I think you're confused, my friend.
[147:30.83]Who's your com- Christ, man, you must be smoking rock.
[147:35.66]I am king of the Latin Lords.
[147:38.04]Crackhead.
[147:38.58]Look at play, my friend.
[147:40.16]Magdalena's been using you to take out their competition.
[147:44.36]They are real sneaky like that.
[147:46.64]Lest I hurt you.
[147:47.91]They import their shitty South American artifacts through the Suma Museum uptown.
[147:52.77]Whoa, whoa, what is going on in chat?
[147:54.19]What's going on?
[147:54.77]Everyone's getting, like, banned.
[147:56.45]Whoa!
[147:57.61]Thanks.
[147:58.23]What happened?
[148:00.17]What happened?
[148:01.73]No!
[148:02.05]God damn it!
[148:02.69]I'm looking at chat, and I fucking just shot a guy in the head.
[148:05.45]What happened?
[148:22.20]Are you killing my prime suspect, Slick?
[148:24.84]A dead witness is not an effective witness.
[148:27.23]Try to remember that.
[148:30.35]What the hell?
[148:31.23]Hello?
[148:31.35]Hello, detective.
[148:32.29]I almost forgot.
[148:33.63]I have a contact for you, which could prove useful.
[148:37.57]A lady you may have heard of, Miss Cassandra Hartz.
[148:40.94]New York's finest madam.
[148:42.92]More importantly, though, she's a purveyor of information.
[148:46.33]That is a large moon.
[148:47.98]Where'd the bike go?
[148:49.46]The uppercutting wrench bump.
[148:51.96]Oh, hell no!
[149:13.82]Damn it.
[149:15.06]I gotta get him.
[149:15.50]I gotta end it with a wrench.
[149:19.06]Perfect.
[149:20.90]Screwdriver here.
[149:23.34]Alright, where are we gonna go now?
[149:28.11]What's the next step here?
[149:30.71]That is an unbelievable car that I do not want to lose.
[149:36.41]Keep it going.
[149:37.09]Keep the story going.
[149:40.56]So, um...
[149:48.02]Doesn't matter, we're fine.
[149:50.30]What is making that noise?
[149:52.26]So, the last game had weird choices.
[149:55.41]Where you went through different parts of the game, and there was the story split.
[150:00.93]I wonder if we're gonna get that, or if it's just happening in the background.
[150:10.02]Oh, that's fucked up!
[150:13.67]I have to do it, guys.
[150:14.37]I'm sorry.
[150:14.79]Every time I see a bike, they have to get run over.
[150:18.53]Didn't kill him.
[150:22.67]He's fine.
[150:23.11]No minus.
[150:30.40]Alright, this is going to blow up.
[150:32.98]I'm going to get out of this.
[150:35.36]Take the bike instead.
[150:38.60]Really?
[150:38.82]That didn't hit the... How did that not hit the bike?
[150:42.15]That was my master plan.
[150:44.11]It's alright.
[150:44.83]I got another plan.
[150:52.17]Didn't even hit either of them.
[150:55.03]Don't know how that's possible.
[151:00.11]This person's not doing so well.
[151:04.45]What's wrong with this person?
[151:05.23]I think this person's asleep at the wheel.
[151:09.09]Wouldn't the bike just tip over?
[151:13.23]Yeah, this person's asleep.
[151:21.55]What do we do about this?
[151:23.34]Should I wake her up?
[151:28.72]Oh, I so badly wanted to... I know, tip over.
[151:31.22]Why is she not tipping over?
[151:38.83]I can't help it.
[151:42.76]She's stuck in the bike.
[151:43.64]Oh, god damn.
[151:44.94]Oh, fuck!
[151:51.60]I don't know.
[151:52.14]I have no explanation.
[151:53.22]Sorry.
[151:55.70]This is a fast bike.
[151:57.30]That is for sure.
[151:59.51]Her head exploded like a watermelon at a Galaga concert.
[152:04.39]Ugh.
[152:07.93]Risky!
[152:09.45]Come on.
[152:13.23]That wasn't even responsible.
[152:14.75]He must have fist fight me.
[152:16.35]I'm not going to fist fight you, dude.
[152:17.72]Get out of here.
[152:18.66]Cops.
[152:20.02]Cops.
[152:22.28]Don't have to be that angry about it.
[152:23.60]I know.
[152:27.20]Don't have to be so angry.
[152:37.78]God, I wish I could punch this guy in the face.
[152:40.26]I'm gonna take out my rage somewhere.
[152:42.18]Get out of the top of the car.
[152:49.60]Oh God, get out of the way everybody.
[152:51.78]I'm a cop.
[152:52.50]Oh, I love it.
[152:53.18]I love this game.
[153:07.01]I love this game at times one and a half speed as well.
[153:12.87]It has a super charm to it.
[153:14.31]God damn it.
[153:16.02]What happened?
[153:19.46]Why?
[153:19.64]I don't understand.
[153:21.92]Just get in the fucking building.
[153:23.58]Oh, it's not even available anymore.
[153:25.09]I'm a cop, and I gotta Jack your vehicle.
[153:28.55]Off-surge scene.
[153:29.11]What the hell?
[153:35.95]Alright, next mission.
[153:42.09]I want to fight a boss.
[153:43.29]That kind of was a boss, wasn't it?
[153:54.45]Three viewers started watching on a site that lets you watch random people for five minutes?
[154:00.63]Wait, you guys... Some of you guys just came from, like, Twitch chat roulette?
[154:06.67]Hi.
[154:07.15]What the fuck?
[154:11.73]I'm going to impress you in the next three minutes.
[154:14.79]How do I impress these people in three minutes?
[154:16.53]Okay.
[154:17.09]I don't know.
[154:19.65]I don't know.
[154:21.22]What am I supposed to say?
[154:21.92]I don't want that part.
[154:29.40]Out of the way.
[154:35.39]What's going on?
[154:37.05]Oh.
[154:39.66]First person mode time.
[154:40.60]You gotta do this at least once every game, right?
[154:44.76]I'm gonna make everybody sick.
[154:45.90]Those three people are gonna get sick and leave.
[154:52.03]I'm just a ping pong ball.
[154:57.97]Or I'm a Dementor from Harry Potter.
[155:08.92]Really?
[155:15.64]Nice product placement.
[155:18.52]Oh, you did?
[155:20.50]Excellent.
[155:21.84]With the Lords out of the way, the Magdalenas now have the market corner.
[155:28.24]The new shipment?
[155:30.27]Yes, yes.
[155:31.33]I'm headed down right now to check on it.
[155:33.27]I'll let you know.
[155:36.70]Yeah, that was a nice reverse Dementor.
[155:39.31]Hello?
[155:39.93]Excuse me, sir.
[155:41.67]The museum is just closed for the day.
[155:44.70]Look at that thing, man.
[155:46.22]I bet this guy needed magnums, huh?
[155:48.86]Oh, that's actually an Aztec warrior, as denoted by his engorgement.
[155:58.64]You know, I would have probably done that democratically with diplomacy, but... Well, okay, that... I wasn't paying attention to that.
[156:14.76]Are these bombs?
[156:19.84]Will they blow up?
[156:24.34]Just kill me so I can restart this.
[156:25.56]I wanna restart it.
[156:30.30]Yeah, now I understand.
[156:31.95]That's fine.
[156:32.39]Yeah, we karate chopped that guy.
[156:33.93]These are blue.
[156:36.03]Lasers are red.
[156:36.83]Like, I think we probably have to... Is there anything over here I can do?
[156:40.59]No.
[156:44.35]So, let's see.
[156:45.26]There's only one way to go.
[156:50.38]Okay, this guy needs to be subdued.
[156:53.27]There's two cops here, though.
[156:54.27]Where's the other one?
[156:59.81]Hey, I think I hear something.
[157:02.17]I'm gonna go check it out.
[157:03.67]Oh, somebody got caught.
[157:05.19]I wanted to sacrifice the... I wanted to sacrifice him!
[157:09.73]Where's the other guy?
[157:13.66]I'm gonna sacrifice this next guy.
[157:19.44]No, I think I heard something.
[157:20.52]I'm gonna go check it out.
[157:25.64]As he doesn't check it out.
[157:27.62]It's right there.
[157:36.49]Oh, shit.
[157:36.83]Hold on.
[157:37.15]He's coming this way.
[157:39.21]Alright.
[157:41.95]I'm going to sacrifice this guy.
[157:45.08]Can I make any noise or something?
[157:46.02]Can I say, like, hey?
[157:47.30]Yeah, I can, right?
[157:47.88]Did you not hear that?
[157:58.88]Just let anybody come in here.
[158:01.42]And I'm gonna show them something, huh?
[158:05.58]Damn.
[158:06.56]She's got the biggest pinchy melons, man.
[158:09.08]Is this guy still talking?
[158:10.42]Oh, I love him, man.
[158:12.76]How is this guy still speaking?
[158:17.68]Hey, what the fuck was that, man?
[158:20.21]Well, lookie here.
[158:23.81]Come with me.
[158:31.18]Seriously?
[158:31.92]Really?
[158:32.22]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[158:33.28]Right when we get to the cool thing I want to do?
[158:37.26]Give me a fucking break.
[158:38.24]Where the fuck is he?
[158:44.45]Oh my god.
[158:47.47]Get up.
[158:50.79]Get up.
[158:53.13]And get fucking sacrificed.
[159:01.02]That was so not worth it.
[159:06.50]I just... WWF Ultimate Warrior threw him over the top ropes into spikes.
[159:12.55]Well, um... One time, asshole.
[159:15.23]This guy is gonna shoot me, so I might as well non-lethal this dude, right?
[159:18.40]Agachate, idiota!
[159:32.17]Where's this other guy shooting from?
[159:50.24]No, it's just this guy.
[159:55.46]The thing is, does he know that I'm even over here?
[159:59.87]He might be a fucking idiot.
[160:02.42]He's still shooting.
[160:03.02]No, he's shooting over here now.
[160:05.66]This is where we start.
[160:06.60]Wait till he reloads.
[160:11.50]Good cop still.
[160:12.24]Alright, keep the sneak going.
[160:23.19]Corp arrested.
[160:23.91]Aren't those security guards?
[160:26.35]Aren't I kind of the bad guy right now?
[160:30.15]If I were to take a wild guess, I'd be the bad guy, wouldn't I?
[160:35.11]Well, I have to do something here.
[160:38.69]Not much I can do.
[160:39.49]I'm going to have to shoot this dude.
[160:41.90]I'm going to try to get him right in the gun.
[160:44.32]Okay, well, there wasn't an opportunity.
[160:49.16]Opportunity, so the gun turned into his head.
[160:54.03]Where is he?
[161:02.11]Okay.
[161:08.70]Not the sacrificial altar.
[161:12.34]Fuck.
[161:13.36]I think that guy's faking it.
[161:19.33]I don't think that guy's dead.
[161:21.59]Now he is.
[161:29.69]Yeah, why are we at some Mayan temple right now?
[161:33.69]I can't really fuck around.
[161:35.71]I have to just shoot everybody.
[161:37.07]I have no health.
[161:38.61]We used all the health trying to do the funny throw the guy.
[161:41.39]Oh no, this is a bad spot.
[161:56.26]Shut up!
[162:10.50]Dead?
[162:11.44]Dead.
[162:16.26]Okay.
[162:18.12]Anything else?
[162:18.94]Or do I go up the stairs?
[162:20.06]I'm going to run into this guy and he's going to QTE me around the corner probably.
[162:29.43]I think we're good to go.
[162:34.17]Alright.
[162:36.61]We're going to the storage unit.
[162:38.31]Sounds good.
[162:41.53]That was quick.
[162:43.33]Help.
[162:44.23]I need that so desperately.
[162:46.27]Now I can chill for a second.
[162:47.81]I can relax.
[162:48.39]I don't have to worry.
[162:50.72]Pick up weapon.
[162:51.82]Got handguns.
[162:54.34]Why am I putting these down?
[162:55.98]I guess I have to use them now apparently because when I scroll, I throw them on the ground.
[163:02.19]That's unfortunate.
[163:05.03]Oh well.
[163:06.77]We'll see what's down here.
[163:08.34]Kill him, or the Magdalenas will have your heads.
[163:11.62]Okay.
[163:17.78]Get him.
[163:18.92]Okay.
[163:21.60]So.
[163:38.40]What did we learn?
[163:39.04]Give me the shotgun.
[163:43.28]Shotgun.
[163:43.86]There we go.
[163:47.88]Oh!
[163:52.52]No, interrogate.
[163:53.30]Interrogate him.
[163:53.82]I need info.
[163:56.22]I know what's shipped inside these relics.
[163:58.80]I can get real creative.
[164:02.05]Okay.
[164:02.50]Demand.
[164:03.12]Got the one.
[164:04.06]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[164:42.86]I don't know much, but I do know that we send these shipments to the Salvation Ward up on Greenwich and West 11th.
[164:50.16]Do you understand?
[164:51.36]I want to sacrifice this guy.
[164:53.40]You've done the right thing.
[165:00.42]Come with me.
[165:05.56]Yeah, we're going for a little trip.
[165:10.38]Am I going to squish his head in here?
[165:25.43]It's just silent.
[165:27.01]There's no sound.
[165:27.93]Oh, no.
[165:39.78]I can't get in.
[165:45.16]No, we can't go in.
[165:45.96]Like, he can't be sacrificed.
[165:47.40]That's so dumb.
[165:48.62]I'm so annoyed by that.
[165:49.48]Just gonna have a restroom.
[165:52.56]I'm just gonna go to the restroom.
[165:54.10]Yeah.
[165:55.82]Yeah, I can't.
[166:01.50]I gotta go in the elevator to go back and I can't use the elevator.
[166:06.85]Evidence, though.
[166:07.39]Let's get all this evidence.
[166:08.17]As much as I can collect.
[166:09.35]Evidence.
[166:13.81]Evidence.
[166:15.92]Any more evidence?
[166:16.62]This looks like evidence.
[166:17.84]Apparently not.
[166:26.17]Evidence?
[166:28.67]No, that's fine.
[166:31.85]Go through the tiny door.
[166:32.81]Oh, it's just three of three.
[166:36.15]Okay, that's cool.
[166:47.33]Branching a knife.
[166:49.19]Please stop.
[166:50.15]I can give you no money.
[166:51.50]Shut up, Cappy.
[166:52.52]Is that guy wearing a GoPro?
[166:54.70]What?
[166:55.44]It's the third time this week.
[166:57.26]I give you nothing, you mother bitch.
[166:59.48]No, it's a backwards hat.
[167:00.52]I advise you to leave while you still can.
[167:03.95]Police.
[167:05.13]Okay, it's cool, man.
[167:08.86]That's a normal thing that would happen to a pedestrian in this game
[167:39.12]I mean, whatever info you have.
[167:45.31]I'm just staring through this guy.
[167:46.92]Oh, if I didn't accept a task, I need to accept a task?
[168:21.71]I don't know what he said.
[168:25.98]No?
[168:28.36]Honestly, I'm not going to lie.
[168:30.04]I wouldn't pay any goddamn attention.
[168:32.34]So you guys can pick.
[168:35.08]Yes or no?
[168:36.44]We'll do a straw poll.
[168:37.22]I don't know if this matters for the story, but if it does, then it does.
[168:42.67]Yes.
[168:44.05]No.
[168:44.19]No.
[168:46.49]There you go.
[168:50.87]Put it back over here.
[168:55.35]And thank you for voting.
[168:57.36]Put it in the chat again.
[169:08.70]Yes lets you drive a car.
[169:09.76]That is true.
[169:10.72]You're right.
[169:16.40]Looks like this is not even a contest.
[169:21.28]Yeah, there's no coming back from this election.
[169:22.86]This is almost 80%.
[169:23.54]Yes.
[169:23.96]Yeah.
[169:28.03]Unless there's a huge swing of votes here.
[169:32.17]No, that's it.
[169:33.85]Closing it.
[169:34.99]Thanks for voting.
[169:36.15]We're going to say yes.
[169:39.67]But hold on a second.
[169:40.41]First of all, I want to say thanks to Never Trust a Purple who gave $50 earlier among a bunch of people giving other bits, but we'll get to those after the stream.
[169:49.44]But thanks, Purple, for the $50.
[169:53.03]they say, I would personally say don't fix anything.
[169:55.93]This is absolutely hilarious and broken.
[169:58.27]Or hold a straw poll and let people decide if they want a logical game or more of the fever dream.
[170:02.81]Yeah, well, at the end of the stream, if you guys want more of the times 30% or plus 30% stream, I'll keep doing it.
[170:11.76]Because it is pretty funny, actually.
[170:13.34]And it's going to be hard to get used to the other version, so we'll see.
[170:17.30]But thanks, man.
[170:19.35]Alright, let's get back to it.
[170:20.91]We're going to say yes, accept his task.
[170:24.71]I like my friend, I like.
[170:28.67]He said don't do any damage to the car.
[170:30.33]Man, I gotta be a cab driver for this fool?
[170:32.39]Pick up fare.
[170:33.67]Next thing you know I'll be flying remote controlled toys and shit.
[170:37.77]That's a dig it, GTA.
[170:41.81]Okay, so the fare is right here.
[170:45.92]What in the blue hell do you think you're doing?
[170:49.52]I have a meeting.
[170:50.64]Step on it and don't drive like a maniac, or I'll have your medallion.
[170:55.07]Isn't that counterintuitive?
[170:57.41]Hello?
[170:57.81]Don't drive like a maniac.
[171:00.17]Asshole!
[171:01.21]What are you doing?
[171:05.90]Trying so hard.
[171:07.32]No, it's not gonna happen God damn it.
[171:13.04]I'm done.
[171:13.90]I'm going the right way.
[171:14.84]We're gonna get on the right side of the road No more of this bullshit What are you doing Good sure
[171:32.26]Yo, you better buckle up!
[171:33.02]What's his following rules?
[171:34.68]Why is he calling people and hanging up?
[171:35.60]It's distracting me.
[172:02.95]There's the drop zone.
[172:06.33]Get out of here, you fucking asshole.
[172:08.15]Yeah, fine.
[172:09.76]That's fine.
[172:10.36]Pick up.
[172:10.58]I got time.
[172:10.86]Straight ahead.
[172:11.74]He's making lots of calls.
[172:13.42]Yeah, he's saying one sentence and hanging up.
[172:28.85]He's doing the equivalent of tweet-replying people.
[172:31.60]Alright, taxi.
[172:32.60]Get in.
[172:33.82]Taxi!
[172:34.96]Taxi!
[172:37.76]Get over here!
[172:39.82]Hi.
[172:40.52]Where you going today, sir?
[172:42.48]I'm not from around here.
[172:43.98]Could you get me to the walking tour?
[172:48.19]Easy.
[172:49.53]And the subway don't smell as bad as I thought it would.
[172:52.53]Easy.
[172:53.09]Wow.
[172:54.61]Good shirt.
[172:56.62]Well, I tell you what.
[172:58.12]These city folks are mighty strange, you know.
[173:02.06]Yes, they are.
[173:03.74]Everyone's... Whoa, Nelly!
[173:05.78]Is this guy supposed to have, like, an Irish accent or something, or a Scottish accent?
[173:11.15]Whoa!
[173:13.89]Thanks a lot, son.
[173:16.15]This car's gonna explode.
[173:18.88]We've got a couple more fares.
[173:20.32]Oh, my God!
[173:22.26]Alright, over-under.
[173:23.64]Can I do the other two fares without the cab exploding?
[173:27.25]What do you guys think?
[173:30.43]Okay, I'm not looking.
[173:32.55]I have to actually be careful here.
[173:34.21]Enough.
[173:35.30]Drive... Drive normally.
[173:42.02]Otherwise, I got plenty of time.
[173:43.22]I got two and a half minutes.
[173:52.68]Be easy.
[173:54.82]Look both ways before you cross the intersection.
[173:57.82]To the right.
[174:04.25]Get a red light up here?
[174:05.01]No.
[174:07.71]Plenty of time.
[174:12.12]Get it.
[174:14.95]We're two, lady.
[174:15.81]Come on, hurry up.
[174:16.97]As long as you don't drive like my ex-husband, I don't care where you go.
[174:21.63]I can just turn around like this.
[174:22.75]Why am I trying to do a five-point turn?
[174:24.64]Your driving reminds me of my ex-husband, Raymond.
[174:31.10]He was the love of my life until I caught up with another woman.
[174:35.12]Every road I turn down, his car is coming up.
[174:38.34]And he brought me on TV to tell me.
[174:40.81]Hey!
[174:41.11]Hey!
[174:45.59]I'm laughing, I'm sorry.
[174:47.93]I can't help every fucking road I turn down is the wrong way.
[174:52.19]Car is going the opposite direction.
[174:53.83]This thing is so close.
[175:00.16]Do they think we have time to hear the whole story?
[175:03.32]You know what I mean?
[175:08.72]They have all these huge stories to tell us.
[175:11.80]But they're only in the car for five seconds.
[175:15.50]It's supposed to be, oh, drive around and listen to the people's stories.
[175:17.82]They say three sentences.
[175:20.64]Move, motherfuckers!
[175:21.72]Police!
[175:23.72]These guys are racing.
[175:26.12]No!
[175:27.68]It's alright, I just bumper-carred him.

[176:21.57]I don't care.
[176:22.11]I'm going the wrong way.

[176:54.54]Okay, easy.
[176:57.17]47 seconds, I gotta go.
[176:58.27]I gotta punch it.

[177:00.11]Mission accomplished.
[177:00.87]I swear, I'm gonna turn myself in now.
[177:11.58]Return the cab.
[177:12.40]Oh, God.
[177:12.98]You're going to make me do the end here?
[177:15.18]I've got to return the cab.
[177:21.81]Very close to exploding.
[177:26.13]I have no time limit, so I don't have to be crazy.
[177:34.44]Just find the weaves.
[177:37.00]Go straight.
[177:38.96]Just go straight home.
[177:44.39]Nice.
[177:45.97]Erratic driver.
[177:47.01]Erratic driver.
[177:48.97]It's okay.
[177:49.45]We're fine.
[177:54.85]It's far away.
[177:55.71]I see the smoke signals.
[177:56.87]There it is.
[177:59.49]Okay.
[178:00.23]There we go.
[178:08.76]I can probably do those missions now, right?
[178:12.76]I would assume.
[178:15.56]Locate the mental ward.
[178:17.56]Yo, Freddy, I got it done.
[178:19.20]Just don't hassle me no more, okay?
[178:21.46]This is gonna be an interesting mission.
[178:27.68]Fifteen hundred bucks.
[178:29.96]That's pretty good.
[178:34.83]Get out.
[178:35.11]Yo, I did the Twitch.
[178:42.76]He drove right by me.
[178:44.16]Yeah, did the three people that were here from Twitch's... Twitch's roulette raid thing, are you still here?
[178:53.32]Maybe you are.
[178:53.80]If one of you is still here, then that's a win for me.
[178:59.17]That's a 33 percentile.
[179:02.23]A third of you stayed.
[179:05.03]That's pretty good.
[179:13.39]How come they didn't know where he was until I started shooting at him?
[179:19.19]Doesn't that not make any sense?
[179:44.87]Bump him.
[179:47.15]Good.
[179:50.83]And... Back it up.
[179:53.65]Explosions.
[179:57.81]Arrest.
[180:00.46]Oh no.
[180:01.36]I can't.
[180:02.26]That's gonna blow up too.
[180:03.08]Alright, we're fine.
[180:04.64]I got it.
[180:06.86]Weird that I didn't get hit by that.
[180:07.96]Fuck you up.
[180:13.66]Let's go to the mental ward.
[180:15.88]Apparently.
[180:21.05]Yeah, there is actual body part removal in this one.
[180:26.19]Which makes it so much worse every time something horrible happens.
[180:32.05]Like, that shit's not even in GTA.
[180:33.66]Somebody in that trunk.
[180:44.38]Oh, that... Alright, well, we're killing that person somehow.
[180:50.11]Whoops.
[180:56.51]That probably hurts.
[181:00.71]Alright, get her!
[181:01.49]Get her out of the car!
[181:02.13]Stay down.
[181:12.47]Stay down.
[181:13.95]You're under arrest, punk.
[181:18.41]Alright.
[181:20.00]Ma'am, let's get you out of there.
[181:24.76]Huh?
[181:33.73]Give me your car, your keys, and get your ass out.
[181:36.25]I wanted the gun.
[181:39.15]Dead.
[181:48.58]I don't think so.
[181:50.10]She just kind of... Maybe she got out and ran away.
[181:53.34]That's the timeline I'm going with.
[181:55.50]She escaped.
[181:56.48]Alright, where is he?
[181:57.92]Right... Oh, hostage situation at the bank.
[182:05.72]Check it out.
[182:08.92]Where is he?
[182:11.73]Where is he?
[182:12.11]Which one has the gun?
[182:13.23]Who's robbing the bank?
[182:24.83]Oh, that guy.
[182:26.15]Okay.
[182:26.53]Here we go.
[182:27.31]Let's make it quick.
[182:29.15]And... I don't have a gun.
[182:29.98]Does it do?
[182:31.24]And... Here we go.
[182:32.34]One.
[182:33.04]Two.
[182:33.24]Does that person have a gun?
[182:35.88]Who has the gun?
[182:37.64]Did it.
[182:43.38]Result.
[182:45.66]You're all safe.
[182:46.80]I know.
[182:47.16]That's a very traumatic moment.
[182:50.00]I'm sorry.
[182:55.49]Hey, can you open the vault?
[182:56.35]Get out of the way.
[183:06.32]Alright, now let's move on to the mission.
[183:09.78]Of all the cars, I choose this one.
[183:11.18]No, she's still not in there.
[183:15.17]Pluto.
[183:22.11]Doors are hard.
[183:22.85]Yes, they are.
[183:23.67]They can be.

[184:03.73]The bus driver just has no clothes Yeah, if they have pizza bombs we have to get at least five of them.

[184:40.80]Oh, come on.

[184:46.66]Jesus Christ.
[184:51.99]Why is this a tank?
[185:02.32]This is not a fucking military vehicle.
[185:09.34]These things fly up every time.
[185:11.00]Oh, I love it.
[185:11.68]I love it, man.

[186:33.07]Fuck off.
[186:37.74]Not even going to give me a car either.
[186:39.80]Bunch of pricks.
[186:50.14]You went on a ram raid with a bus, killing hundreds, and you're confused why the police came after you.
[186:58.28]No, I'm not confused.
[186:59.72]I just... I'm just a little shook up about it, okay?
[187:03.80]What's in the bag?
[187:05.06]What do you got?
[187:06.97]Oh, no.
[187:21.63]Jesus fuck See that badge alright, we got a crime Just arrest punch punch punch arrest punch punch punch arrest.
[187:37.65]It's very easy formula.
[187:38.81]Just follow it It's a scientifically proven formula that works to corral the criminals every time
[187:48.65]I'm going to wrap around.
[187:49.43]I kind of want to get back in the bus.
[187:53.17]I definitely shouldn't, though.
[187:58.88]Okay, here we go.
[188:02.10]Nice and easy.
[188:02.62]Get the nightstick out.
[188:04.58]And crack some skulls.
[188:07.22]Fuck, shut the bitch's
[188:22.57]What the hell is going on?
[188:24.28]Okay.
[188:25.92]Interesting.
[188:27.12]Was I doing like a finishing move to that guy?
[188:34.40]One more.
[188:36.20]Anybody else in here?
[188:39.75]No.
[188:39.97]Everything is flies though.
[188:43.31]Cop.
[188:46.53]Although that gun looks like a gun I want.
[188:51.78]So we're going to use it.
[188:54.45]Alright, next crime.
[188:55.23]Bring it on.
[188:58.74]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[188:59.78]I want the gun.
[189:02.92]Nightstick's better than the gun?
[189:03.86]I don't know if it's better than a... Come on, maybe... Okay.
[189:12.58]Yes, they are.
[189:19.84]Anything?
[189:20.18]Street vendors?
[189:20.96]I was told.
[189:22.08]Rock band wrecking hotel.
[189:32.56]We haven't done this one yet.
[189:36.86]This one's probably funny.
[189:40.17]I would assume this one is pretty cool.
[189:45.85]They're just trashing a hotel room.
[189:47.37]This would be two or three easy arrests right here.
[189:56.74]Cradle to the grave with you alright take out the nightstick Break it up.
[190:06.13]I Don't see any blood come on That's the people just actually destroyed Yeah, oh They're right over here.

[191:11.23]I want you to see this one.
[191:12.93]Oh fuck.
[191:13.71]Now I can finally go back to what I was doing.
[191:15.24]Thank you.
[191:45.72]No.
[191:46.86]Right when I get the badge back, don't do that.
[191:48.30]Don't be an idiot.
[191:49.38]Alright, I want to go and get a couple of guns.
[191:52.90]I had a chance.
[191:59.93]No.
[192:00.47]I got two grand.
[192:01.23]I'm gonna use it.
[192:02.43]I'm not gonna be a dummy about this.
[192:10.27]What a maniac.
[192:12.25]I guess driving on the wrong side of the road and weaving around like a psycho.
[192:18.61]Take their guy's license away.
[192:27.26]Nobody even got hurt when I did that.
[192:29.46]Yes, he has.
[192:39.52]And he is stuck here.
[192:41.28]Good luck trying to get out of this.
[192:42.88]Good luck.
[192:45.80]He's doing an ambulance.
[192:56.22]Can't get away, man.
[192:57.49]It's not going to do anything for you.
[193:00.19]Take another ambulance, maybe.
[193:01.91]Yep, try that one.
[193:05.77]Go on.
[193:06.03]You have an opportunity.
[193:06.85]He's gonna run out of cars.
[193:09.99]Try that one.
[193:12.58]Steal every car.
[193:14.36]He's not gonna get out.
[193:17.46]Whoa.
[193:17.92]Hey.
[193:18.92]Easy, man.
[193:19.14]Don't steal my car.
[193:31.69]Surrender.
[193:32.15]So I don't understand.
[193:33.57]Oh my god, he wants to fight.
[193:36.78]What the fuck?
[193:38.88]Did he seriously just do that?
[193:40.00]What?
[193:53.96]Fucking idiot.
[193:55.22]Go on, you can make it.
[193:56.56]Maybe if you try hard enough.
[193:57.74]Didn't he just dive out and die?
[193:59.68]He doesn't know how to get out.
[194:04.68]He can't figure out how to leave.
[194:05.86]He figured out how to leave.
[194:07.69]Okay, no more fucking around.
[194:08.69]Tackle.
[194:09.53]Tackle and head smash into concrete.
[194:12.39]Come here, you.
[194:13.15]There it is.
[194:29.66]It's funny how that's a good cop.
[194:31.92]In what world is smashing a guy's head on the ground over and over again a good cop?
[194:37.29]That's a pretty bad cop, if you ask me.
[194:43.15]Oh, okay.
[194:45.03]I just want to go and buy some guns.
[194:48.30]Oh, shit!
[194:53.92]Focus on the mission at hand, and that is to get grenades.
[194:57.96]All I care about.
[194:58.60]Not gonna lie, that was probably kind of fun for them.
[195:01.56]Done.
[195:01.78]Keep going.
[195:02.40]I can't turn it.
[195:26.00]Bayblade.
[195:29.52]That, you know, that wasn't a good cop.
[195:35.35]You're right.
[195:44.13]You have to give me a little bit of credit, though.
[195:45.61]Give me some slack.
[195:46.90]I am playing the game at like times two speed.
[195:57.01]I have to do more good things, or else I'm gonna lose my license again.
[196:08.93]So you can speedrun this game like this, technically, right?
[196:11.53]Because this is just not a game, pre-patched.
[196:15.56]Gunshot.
[196:16.58]Can I not go in this?
[196:27.11]Pharmacy gun shop Groceries gone.
[196:29.33]Why is the gun store closed?
[196:30.37]Why Daytime maybe What's happening
[196:54.93]This is a PS2 game, but this is the PC version of the game.
[196:58.91]Look at the hours.
[197:00.81]Shit, we need time to pass.
[197:05.29]I know a really, really easy way to pass time in this game.
[197:10.36]Oh, they didn't hit me.
[197:12.38]Just die, and it'll be daytime.
[197:18.76]So, it is a... Well, it's a PC game.
[197:20.50]It was a PlayStation 2 game that was ported.
[197:23.63]Very poorly to PC.
[197:26.79]Somebody please just hurt me.
[197:27.89]Stop stomping on a dime and hurt me!
[197:30.29]Hurt me!
[197:32.03]Hurt me!
[197:35.53]What?
[197:35.67]I think I just got hit by nothing.
[197:41.50]Go!
[197:54.99]Yo, I need help with the swiftness.
[197:58.69]Back up into me.
[197:59.95]I need time to... I need to do time travel.
[198:03.51]Fuck it.
[198:06.17]Watch this.
[198:08.39]Damage the whole thing.
[198:10.16]Here we go.
[198:28.13]We're almost at complete red.
[198:30.25]Okay.
[198:41.38]Hey!
[198:42.52]Welcome to the gun store!
[198:44.98]What?
[198:47.66]Are you serious?
[198:53.39]Why can I not get in?
[198:55.63]Where's the entrance?
[198:58.01]Is it not daytime yet?
[198:59.53]Did I- did I sleep too long?
[199:01.57]I think I slept too long.
[199:22.15]Yeah.
[199:22.95]I slept too long.
[199:24.85]I gotta go back to sleep.
[199:32.94]Back to bed with me.
[199:35.36]Don't make me have to subdue you!
[199:45.57]That lady's spinning around in circles.
[199:50.00]The door is right there.
[199:51.94]I can't go in the door.
[199:53.22]This is the grocery store.
[200:03.45]I can't- I can go in the grocery store.
[200:05.15]I can't go in the gun store.
[200:07.75]Because I'm in my uniform?
[200:09.59]Is that really why?
[200:13.58]Oh my god, really?
[200:23.46]What is wrong with this guy?
[200:25.44]This guy is like a skeleton man.
[200:27.08]I don't want to knock this guy off, but I kind of want to at the same time.
[200:38.53]Something's wrong with this dude.
[200:40.47]Only from certain angles.
[200:47.38]You fucking skeleton, man.
[200:57.83]No, you're not.
[200:58.31]That's a lie.
[201:00.25]He's just trying to get attention.
[201:01.83]He's trying to get somebody to pay attention that he thinks he's gonna file a claim and he's gonna try to bring me to court.
[201:08.41]Everyone saw that.
[201:09.09]He's fine.
[201:11.45]So, where?
[201:12.11]I need to go to, like, the house and change clothes.
[201:15.13]Right?
[201:22.42]Where's the house?
[201:25.88]Right here, right?
[201:26.98]Police headquarters.
[201:29.73]Where am I?
[201:30.25]I'm gonna go to police headquarters and just go to the office.
[201:39.23]Fucking hell.
[201:40.55]Get out of the fucking way.
[201:42.71]I'm running on fucking fumes now.
[201:49.34]Go, please.
[201:52.98]These brakes are incredible.
[202:01.06]I'm sure I can buy grenades at the armory.
[202:04.27]Or something like it.
[202:05.03]It's so easy to not get hit.
[202:17.84]Dude, I wish I could punch like road rash style right now.
[202:20.89]Mentally unstable arsonist.
[202:22.51]What the fuck?
[202:23.05]This guy's making fires.
[202:24.07]He sure is.
[202:49.34]Yeah, sure is.
[202:51.56]Of course he picks the cop to throw the fucking fire at.
[202:58.05]The police officer.
[202:59.13]Not the building.
[203:01.53]No, I ain't dealing with any mentally unstable guy anymore.
[203:04.23]That guy flew out of the windshield.
[203:19.92]Slimy bitch.
[203:20.62]Who's doing this?
[203:21.38]Oh, it's this guy's car.
[203:26.65]Pickpocket in the area.
[203:28.29]Locating suspect.
[203:28.87]There he is.
[203:30.11]You're fucked.
[203:52.92]He's taking stuff, right?
[203:59.62]He's pickpocketing me.
[204:02.20]These guys are afraid of guns.
[204:05.24]Alright.
[204:06.12]Now we're gonna get him once in the knee, once in the hand.
[204:08.52]Knee.
[204:09.96]Hand.
[204:12.76]You gonna give up now?
[204:15.29]Yeah, he is.
[204:16.37]You're under arrest.
[204:22.85]New York fucking police.
[204:24.29]Fuck!
[204:29.15]You're under arrest.
[204:30.47]They're dead.
[204:31.51]Nope, police headquarters.

[204:47.14]There we go.
[204:54.81]The delayed... Oh, my fucking God.
[204:56.61]Just get me to the precinct.
[204:57.61]I gotta get in a cab, for Christ's sake.
[205:02.29]No, not the broken down shitbox.
[205:12.93]She's slimy, bitch.
[205:15.60]Oh, my God.
[205:17.75]Back to the precinct.
[205:18.63]Oh, shit!

[205:47.44]Look at all this evidence.
[205:49.06]So did I get more money?
[205:52.84]Got a lot of evidence, right?
[205:53.70]Now I get more money.
[205:54.26]Oh, it's just $40,000.
[205:54.60]Now we can have fun.
[205:55.46]Well, it's that easy, apparently.
[205:56.64]I got $37,000, pretty much.
[205:57.38]Let's go buy a tank.
[206:16.51]Rank 1, rank 3, rank 5.
[206:17.63]Oh, I think this just gives it all to me.
[206:18.93]No?
[206:19.07]I don't understand.
[206:19.86]Rank 1?
[206:20.12]Oh, there we go.
[206:20.70]Okay.
[206:21.02]So we got... What is this?
[206:22.24]Slow motion upgrade for gun dive.
[206:46.55]I got $36,000.
[206:47.83]Stun gun.
[206:53.29]Absolutely.
[206:53.81]This is a standard shotgun.
[206:58.00]No, we don't want that.
[207:00.42]Stun baton.
[207:02.62]Maximum zoom level during precision aim.
[207:05.68]Yeah, I want that.
[207:10.72]Tranquilizer.
[207:15.24]Okay.
[207:15.56]I just want to have them bought just in case.
[207:17.66]What do we got here?
[207:18.22]Sledgehammer.
[207:20.22]I need rank 2.
[207:21.90]Can't do any of these.
[207:23.06]Let's go rank 5.
[207:25.97]Even more aim.
[207:27.25]Precision.
[207:27.95]What is this?
[207:28.29]Caltrops?
[207:28.47]Absolutely.
[207:28.69]Flashlight?
[207:28.95]Okay.
[207:40.94]Yeah, I mean, just buy everything.
[207:42.30]Take care of yourself out there.
[207:43.66]I can always equip it, right?
[207:45.04]Alright, take care of yourself out there.
[207:47.13]Yeah, they're all going to get stored in the trunk.
[207:49.31]And don't forget, you can reload those in your trunk.
[207:53.07]Alright, so where is my trunk?
[207:59.75]You can reload the flashlight.
[208:01.79]Dr. Reed, looking for some guns?
[208:03.97]Wait, hold on a minute.
[208:04.83]I'm confused here.
[208:10.61]Where are these?
[208:11.21]Didn't I just buy all these?
[208:13.21]Alright, man.
[208:14.11]Suit yourself.
[208:14.61]Is this a car trunk?
[208:17.49]Okay.
[208:19.19]Let's go to the garage.
[208:23.97]Let me get a nice car then.
[208:29.54]Alright, what do you got?
[208:30.58]Police cars.
[208:31.08]10,000.
[208:31.10]Alright.
[208:31.28]I don't want to spend that much money.
[208:39.59]I don't want a piece of shit either.
[208:41.05]Uh, civilian skills.
[208:43.23]Oh boy.
[208:43.89]Double tap W to greatly increase acceleration from a full stop.
[208:50.14]Are you serious?
[208:52.92]I'm gonna go even faster.
[208:54.70]We're really gonna break this game.
[208:58.97]Or, press S plus W, then release S for a variation.
[209:04.07]Steer left or right while at speed, then double tap space to make a perfect 100 degree turn.
[209:11.67]Holding W, then double tap space.
[209:14.23]Oh, lord.
[209:17.91]Side wheelie.
[209:21.52]This is going to be interesting.
[209:24.22]Alright, let's get a... Let's get this thing.
[209:26.68]I like it.
[209:27.06]There it is.
[209:28.60]Alright, what do we got in the trunk?
[209:36.46]Here we go.
[209:37.26]Alright, storage we got...
[209:44.05]I don't understand.
[209:46.96]This is what I currently have.
[209:48.28]Space is equipped.
[209:49.28]I think it's already all equipped, isn't it?
[209:52.90]Enter it back.
[209:53.44]Space cancel.
[209:55.30]I'm limited to that.
[209:56.38]Unlimited to that.
[210:01.21]Did I equip them?
[210:03.47]Kind of confused.
[210:08.93]Do I have a...
[210:14.81]Got a ticket at the store.
[210:16.01]Well, I want... Okay, I want the... I wanted the sniper rifle.
[210:18.99]Let's just see what happens when I get out of here.
[210:24.62]Do I actually have them on my person?
[210:29.34]You didn't accept the trade for the other guns.
[210:30.84]Okay, well, I have the other ones, right?
[210:35.31]Oh, come on.
[210:36.05]What?
[210:41.09]Okay, here they are.
[210:45.09]I see.
[210:45.37]Alright, so something's going on over here.
[210:51.13]How come I don't have them on me?
[210:53.87]I have to, like, give to accept.
[210:56.31]You, like, take, equip, and then accept.
[211:01.54]That's not happening.
[211:02.42]Okay, why?
[211:05.64]I have them on.
[211:07.70]Rate of fire, rapid, low, accept.
[211:11.22]I mean, I have them on.
[211:12.88]How come I can't get them?
[211:16.40]All I have is the... these two.
[211:20.71]Like, page up.
[211:23.11]Page up and page down, right?
[211:27.45]It's in storage?
[211:28.33]Or how is it in storage if it's on my guy?
[211:29.97]You know what I mean?
[211:33.50]Like, isn't it on the dude right now?
[211:35.00]Hold on, let me look at this one more time.
[211:43.31]Storage.
[211:44.23]Small.
[211:44.63]Yeah, but I have both of these equipped right now.
[211:48.31]It says... Space!
[211:49.19]Equip!
[211:51.61]See, now they're just down here.
[211:54.17]They're not, like, on me.
[211:56.77]I just don't have anything on me.
[212:03.73]They're in the trunk right now.
[212:05.24]Equip!
[212:05.82]Equip!
[212:07.28]Right?
[212:11.72]I have these on...
[212:14.84]But I don't.
[212:17.72]I'm not gonna pretend to know why.
[212:24.98]Who is... Calm down, man.
[212:26.47]Who's saying that?
[212:27.11]They're in the trunk of the cars that you buy.
[212:30.65]I bought this car.
[212:32.59]Do I have to change clothes to use the other weapons?
[212:40.31]Well, this guy's not gonna get away.
[212:44.51]Alright, let's go to the mission, the actual mission.
[212:49.70]Now let's try the new acceleration.
[212:52.36]Not yet, hold on.
[213:00.06]Alright, so let's hold both, and then release S. Strange maneuver.
[213:07.30]Maybe I have to go to the back of a cop car?
[213:16.03]Alright, W-W.
[213:18.01]Sounds like they're trying to hit... What was the other one I could... Do with like a 180 degree turn, right?
[213:32.36]Straight ahead.
[213:36.41]From a complete stop, okay.
[213:42.96]Let's be at a complete stop.
[213:44.28]I think you should just go faster.
[213:49.12]You accelerate faster.
[214:03.15]On one-way streets.
[214:04.01]But it's the fastest way to get there.
[214:06.35]It really is.
[214:06.85]Because otherwise I have to turn right and go that way to the right.
[214:14.62]Honestly, faster just to weave around.
[214:18.15]Now I can go over here.
[214:19.05]And be there.
[214:28.76]Alright, let's get out.
[214:33.16]Okay, this is the mental ward.
[214:46.00]Uh-oh.
[214:50.52]Have to escape the mental ward.
[214:53.84]A side effect of the drugs we injected you with, I'm afraid.
[214:56.56]We were expecting you.
[215:00.88]Oh, that's the guy that I was interrogating.
[215:02.47]What are you talking about?
[215:04.41]My real name is Magdalena Rojas, widow of Humberto Rojas, the drug star killed by your very own CIA six years ago.
[215:15.31]Look at it on the bright side.
[215:17.05]You took care of Ray, my main rival.
[215:18.68]I should have ghost written this girl off a cliff like an hour ago.
[215:20.98]Fucking bitch.
[215:23.64]Have to be in this business.
[215:25.66]See, I've made some people very rich.
[215:28.68]People who are supposed to eliminate pests like you.
[215:32.01]But the dividends from my investments aren't what they used to be.
[215:34.53]Don't you dare get up and grab that health pack.
[215:36.71]Well, I'd love to chat, but I'm late for the opera.
[215:40.09]I so love the classics.
[215:42.31]That is for me and my men.
[215:43.38]Have to play with your new friends.
[215:47.86]What the hell is this?
[215:53.88]Why?
[215:55.64]Now I have to go against the zombies?
[215:58.72]Oh no.
[215:59.94]Defeat the inmates.
[216:01.04]How?
[216:09.65]Actually, this is better without the arms.
[216:20.69]I'm out.
[216:21.52]Wow, it's that easy to get out of a straitjacket.
[216:24.56]Houdini was a loser.
[216:25.76]Spinning.
[216:26.72]No, not quite.
[216:27.38]What are you going to do?
[216:31.16]Just grab him.
[216:33.96]See that?
[216:50.49]That's Beetlejuice from Howard Stern.
[216:53.52]No, why?
[216:56.62]What kind of cameo is Beetlejuice from Howard Stern?
[217:00.62]It's the strangest... I don't understand.
[217:02.74]Why is he in this?
[217:03.64]I guess it's...
[217:19.27]I guess so.
[217:20.91]This is just like that time in the seasons.
[217:23.07]Okay, well.
[217:25.45]Is he stay- Let's go, sunshine.
[217:27.76]He might be a real character now.
[217:29.06]Yep, yep, yep.
[217:29.74]Roll away, dude.
[217:30.90]Leave us a roll.
[217:34.22]That guy's not a threat, I don't think.
[217:39.47]Stay away from me!
[217:43.56]Just open the cell.
[217:44.48]Who's in here?
[217:45.00]Help me, Beetlejuice!
[217:47.48]There we go.
[217:47.94]Oh no, Beetlejuice down.
[217:49.63]They do it every time.
[218:06.76]This old man is going to kick your ass.
[218:08.90]He's really small, so I didn't get to hit him.
[218:12.00]For the greater good.
[218:13.40]Alright.
[218:14.04]Wait, can I pick up the wrench?
[218:15.44]Two steps forward, three steps back.
[218:17.76]Crazy.
[218:19.70]Game over, Harvey.
[218:21.60]Have you seen me?
[218:24.75]Wait.
[218:26.73]What the fuck was that?
[218:30.21]This guy's going to surrender.
[218:32.23]Surrender, surrender, surrender.
[218:33.33]Stop running.
[218:34.09]Danger.
[218:34.41]Look out.
[218:36.93]Give me the syringe.
[218:39.83]There actually is a syringe weapon in the game.
[218:41.94]Best game ever made.
[218:45.58]I'm so glad this is a gus.
[218:47.12]I can't even talk.
[218:48.68]I'm too excited.
[218:52.61]Oh, shit.
[218:59.19]Well, the syringe is not as good as it's supposed to be.
[219:06.74]Beetlejuice, do something.
[219:07.62]Help me.
[219:07.98]Come on.
[219:10.62]Okay.
[219:12.24]I'm gonna put you in the grave.
[219:17.22]Stay down.
[219:17.54]Give me the gun.
[219:18.06]Give me one of those things.
[219:20.38]No, no.
[219:20.62]Don't open a cell.
[219:21.34]I want to... I want to grab this, not open a cell.
[219:26.12]I'm gonna eat your face off, boy.
[219:33.87]Zapped.
[219:36.69]Where's that health pack?
[219:41.08]Where's the one that... Come on, where is it?
[219:42.36]We're wheeled by it.
[219:45.22]Nurse's station.
[219:46.04]Okay, let's go this way.
[219:48.40]What was that?
[219:49.00]Oh, no.
[219:49.70]Don't open any more cells.
[219:51.05]Just saying random shit.
[219:53.53]Oops.
[220:09.54]Now someone's having a good time here.
[220:12.84]Syringe.
[220:13.18]Guy with the syringe has to go down first.
[220:16.12]Stay back.
[220:16.46]Get out of the way.
[220:38.96]What?
[220:39.50]Who am I looking at here?
[220:40.16]The same line.
[220:41.20]Hey!
[220:42.23]How did I miss?
[220:44.13]Hey, Beetlejuice.
[220:44.85]Welcome back.
[220:45.69]Walk into it.
[221:07.75]Why is this car not working?
[221:13.21]Car?
[221:15.67]Why is the car not working?
[221:18.45]This is just like that time in the seasons.
[221:22.31]Finally.
[221:22.79]My God, that took a long bath.
[221:24.67]Alright, build your still of this stuff.
[221:28.03]Stay away from me.
[221:29.61]That's not the way.
[221:30.56]The only way is wrong.
[221:33.51]Thanks, Beetlejuice.
[221:34.31]Appreciate the help, dude.
[221:35.84]They can't stop us, sir.
[221:38.56]You big Nancy boy now.
[221:41.90]Yep, yep, yep.
[221:42.86]Roll away, dude.
[221:44.04]Leave us a roll.
[221:46.24]Get off.
[221:47.92]Really, how did I not break out of that shit?
[221:50.63]Give me a break, Beetlejuice.
[221:52.09]Ah, shit.
[221:53.19]Fuck.
[221:54.51]Just use the car muffler for the rest of the game.
[221:56.47]I can get behind that.
[221:58.55]Don't give a stash!
[222:02.42]Any more healing?
[222:03.72]Syringe?
[222:04.32]No.
[222:04.50]Why would I use it?
[222:05.63]Idiota!
[222:08.35]Found some evidence.
[222:09.05]Small packet of drugs.
[222:09.95]One of thirteen.
[222:10.35]Come back here.
[222:11.07]You're gonna hurt yourself.
[222:15.93]Goodbye.
[222:17.93]All together.
[222:18.71]Two steps forward, three steps back.
[222:21.03]Crazy.
[222:21.51]Alright, Beetlejuice, you know how to get out of here.
[222:24.52]Please tell me the way to go.
[222:25.68]Over here.
[222:25.98]You can't stop us, friend.
[222:27.60]Not today.
[222:28.68]No way.
[222:29.74]No way out.
[222:34.63]Wait, I got your medication.
[222:36.61]I got a rabbit one here.
[222:40.47]Right across the chin.
[222:41.45]Round two, Zeke.
[222:42.25]Step up.
[222:45.29]The code is 5-4-2-6.
[222:47.67]Let's get out of here.
[222:53.25]Any more evidence I can steal?
[222:56.43]Not in the greater area.
[223:00.03]Watch out.
[223:00.85]Woody's crazy.
[223:01.65]We're almost there now.
[223:03.40]I guess a gun.
[223:03.90]Okay, well, Beetlejuice, you go first.
[223:09.52]Just you check it out.
[223:12.54]It's definitely much safer if you were to go first.
[223:16.28]You know where to go.
[223:16.76]You know the codes.
[223:17.62]You know the way out.
[223:29.68]He's not going to move.
[223:31.63]You're gonna see how we deal with escapees here.
[223:34.78]If he ain't trying to kill me, what the fuck is he up to?
[223:37.20]I don't plan on finding out.
[223:42.76]The cutscene wasn't even over.
[223:46.50]Oh, I ran out of juice on the... Do you hear the window sound?
[223:52.87]Why is it a windows gun?
[223:54.87]His gun was having windows errors.
[224:02.17]Maybe you should get off of XP, buddy.
[224:12.38]Oh no, it crashed.
[224:13.48]Windows sucks.
[224:17.28]Where's Beetlejuice?
[224:18.54]Time left.
[224:19.50]Why do we have this time left?
[224:22.76]Time left for what?
[224:25.01]What's the time left for?
[224:30.23]I don't have fucking time for this shit.
[224:32.68]This is gonna blow up, isn't it?
[224:39.96]That was a BBS.
[224:40.70]That was a beanbag Sonic shotgun.
[224:44.41]I... Fuck.
[224:46.71]I need a new car.
[224:48.07]Get out.
[224:48.31]Yo, I ain't bad for anything that happens to this.
[224:58.27]Go.
[225:00.54]A minute and 15 seconds.
[225:06.88]Was Beetlejuice supposed to escape with me?
[225:08.32]Because he did not make it.
[225:16.81]No, no.
[225:17.25]Not my window shotgun.
[225:19.29]I had all these crashes with it.
[225:20.69]I shouldn't have downloaded so much porn on this.
[225:28.52]Um... Something might be wrong.
[225:39.46]Get in my fucking way.
[225:47.03]I don't understand.
[225:48.19]Was I... Uh... Zero seconds.
[225:58.60]Oh no.
[225:59.54]What happened?
[226:00.10]I was supposed to do that.
[226:03.12]How did I not make it in time?
[226:04.70]It's alright.
[226:05.80]Race to an opera house.
[226:12.21]I did have to do that.
[226:22.11]It's not like I'm paying for that.
[226:24.93]So those of you people watching the VOD right now, or even those of you watching right now, I would like for someone to count the amount of times that I've driven down a road going the correct path with traffic.
[226:37.70]I'm going to take a guess.
[226:38.91]We've been playing for about, what, four hours?
[226:40.65]Four and a half hours?
[226:41.31]Something like that?
[226:42.83]I bet you it's less than five times.
[226:45.09]In four hours.
[226:47.43]Somebody count?
[226:48.87]Let me know next stream.
[227:03.69]That would be sick if I got away with it.
[227:10.35]Yes, I'm allowing counting for that.
[227:14.26]Got a full minute.
[227:20.64]I'm a cop.
[227:22.92]What does Arnold Schwarzenegger say in that movie?
[227:25.37]Calls the guy an idiot?
[227:31.50]Am I gonna get the tranquilizer?
[227:32.74]It's me eating an apple.
[227:41.69]This is so dumb.
[227:44.53]Why wouldn't I just do a throwing knife at her?
[227:47.41]Shit!
[227:48.71]Why would you do that?
[227:59.55]Kill that mocoso, you idiotas!
[228:06.90]Damn!
[228:07.36]I'm pinned down!
[228:10.46]Adelante!
[228:15.58]Lo veo, lo veo!
[228:16.39]Mátalo!
[228:18.77]Mátalo!
[228:27.06]Why was she still singing?
[228:28.22]I'm sorry, but you're a bad guy.
[228:30.46]He's trying to sing me.
[228:33.34]Get out of my way.
[228:35.48]Great animation.
[228:58.02]Isn't this supposed to be more zoomed in?
[229:04.30]How do I do the gun dive?
[229:06.68]Probably some way to do it.
[229:07.54]You're the worst.
[229:14.47]How awful could you get as a bodyguard?
[229:20.09]Covered!
[229:23.26]Fuck!
[229:28.78]What the fuck?
[229:30.82]I have the sniper rifle now.
[229:33.76]Oh, arrest.
[229:38.21]Okay, so you guys were right.
[229:39.83]Somebody in the chat was right.
[229:41.63]I needed to be in different clothes.
[229:49.60]What the fuck is that gun?
[230:03.89]Well, I'm definitely going to use this.
[230:06.19]Give me the sniper rifle.
[230:09.73]This will be easier.
[230:10.73]Where did the sniper rifle go?
[230:12.77]I dropped it.
[230:35.77]They're dying, I don't have to do anything.
[230:37.01]Somebody's killing them.
[230:46.73]There we go.
[230:52.75]Why does he keep doing this?
[230:54.06]Aww, that's too bad.
[231:05.25]It's this guy that won't shut the fuck up.
[231:09.75]Can I get a nightstick throw?
[231:10.63]What do you think?
[231:12.23]I'll try it.
[231:12.65]No, that ain't gonna work.
[231:18.03]Just fucking shoot the guy.
[231:32.50]Oh, it's a stun gun.
[231:38.15]I can't even shoot anybody.
[231:40.37]This is over.
[231:41.07]I can't shoot anything.
[231:45.77]There's no... I can't do it.
[231:47.15]Game over.
[231:48.77]I have to throw the nightstick.
[231:52.83]This guy has to fucking die.
[231:56.89]I'm gonna elect... Yeah, good.
[231:59.26]That guy had to fucking die.
[232:00.12]He did.
[232:00.42]You all know it.
[232:02.66]Now I'm gonna get this dude.
[232:04.72]With a throw.
[232:07.00]Now I'm done.
[232:07.70]Fucking dickheads.
[232:08.44]Let me try it.
[232:10.82]If I just stay here.
[232:15.13]No.
[232:15.49]At least I can shoot the gun now.
[232:18.27]What is... Why?
[232:20.05]Come on.
[232:21.47]Don't do the Super Mario.
[232:25.39]Get out of here.
[232:33.70]Where is she?
[232:36.76]Is she the boat?
[232:40.84]I'm very confused right now.
[232:44.78]She's the boat.
[232:45.47]She transformed.
[232:46.15]Yeah.
[232:46.41]Is she in there?
[233:05.19]Yeah, well... Fuck.
[233:07.08]No, don't blow it here.
[233:07.88]Come on.
[233:12.52]Seriously.
[233:13.32]No.
[233:13.48]No, stop it.
[233:15.50]No.
[233:15.88]God damn it.
[233:20.85]Ugh.
[233:21.15]Shit.
[233:21.65]Shit.
[233:33.43]Oh, why?
[233:34.24]Just go quickly.
[233:38.20]Hurry up.
[233:39.26]I'm not wasting time.
[233:40.20]I've got to get out of here.
[233:57.39]I ain't playing around.
[233:58.49]You're supposed to be dead.
[234:08.65]Why do I just get this equipped?
[234:11.27]Now I just get this equipped.
[234:12.33]Now it's just equipped.
[234:13.53]Now the damn thing's equipped.
[234:15.07]Now the goddamn thing is just equipped.
[234:19.11]He's dead.
[234:23.17]Why does this thing just immediately gets equipped?
[234:25.77]You understand how stupid this is?
[234:30.02]Okay, I'm gonna show you something.
[234:32.84]Take a look.
[234:33.70]Take a look.
[234:35.96]I don't have them equipped.
[234:38.26]Nightstick, 38 auto.
[234:40.90]I just instantly get them equipped.
[234:44.63]God damn it.
[234:59.10]I'm breaking that lady's neck, by the way.
[235:01.12]Venga, cabrón.
[235:10.72]I just have it.
[235:11.40]Shut up, ladies.
[235:13.36]Shut up.
[235:16.50]I literally live for now.
[235:44.19]I'm replacing this.
[235:46.09]Get this fucking thing off.
[236:15.66]Please die.
[236:23.14]As good as new.
[236:30.50]No, hold on.
[236:31.66]Give me... I don't want the shotgun.
[236:34.12]Give me this thing.
[236:35.21]No, I do not.
[236:49.25]Three more people come out here.
[236:53.95]I need the, like, assault rifle for this.
[236:57.39]Nothing in there.
[236:58.43]Shotgun.
[236:58.85]I'll take a shotgun.
[237:00.47]Okay, here we go.
[237:07.21]Get the fuck out of here.
[237:12.73]Anybody else got a gun?
[237:13.39]You got a better gun?
[237:14.09]Ammo.
[237:14.81]I like the shotgun.
[237:16.15]Okay, now that's what I need.
[237:19.90]Although it's not the same, I need something else.
[237:21.54]This is not at that great right here.
[237:24.13]I will take the SMG instead.
[237:25.63]One more guy over here.
[237:35.01]Get the fucking stun gun out of my life.
[237:44.29]There's no more guns through there, thank god.
[237:55.83]Alright, so you double tap space.
[238:01.52]I need a better weapon than this.
[238:03.70]There we go.
[238:06.48]Now the auto machine gun comes over here.
[238:13.63]I'm not going to use that.
[238:14.97]I'm going to pick that up when she's out here.
[238:16.41]Let her live.
[238:30.50]I'm going to pick up the Gatling gun and just give him the thing.
[238:38.93]Counter-strike hacking aim.
[238:40.37]Okay, this is the last guy.
[238:45.71]Let's pick this up.
[238:47.88]Here we go.
[238:48.28]I am through playing.

[239:05.96]Shoot the fuel tanks.
[239:07.14]Where are the fuel tanks?
[239:10.92]Fuel to inside.
[239:11.80]Got it.
[239:31.76]I forgot to kill the lady.
[239:35.99]Oh well.
[239:36.21]Critical myth.

[240:20.61]You guys can pick.
[240:21.55]I'm gonna take a piss.
[240:23.35]I'll be back in two minutes.
[240:28.01]Let me just get a poll.

[243:18.64]Okay, so where are we at?
[243:21.88]It looks like three is the winner.
[243:25.88]Thank you for voting.
[243:27.28]Three.
[243:30.81]Let us do it.
[243:36.91]Come back to here.
[243:39.15]Yeah, alright.
[243:42.67]Okay, it was three, Shadow Tongue.
[243:47.03]Ready to take on New York's most powerful Chinese gang?
[243:50.46]Oh, China, you know, you really should go one day.
[243:53.90]You haven't lived until you've eaten out in China.
[243:56.39]Just watch out for the crabs.
[243:58.75]Little joke, son.
[244:00.92]Did you miss it?
[244:02.38]Anyway, one Uncle Benny used to run the Chinese Tang out of Chinatown for years, had the knockoff merchandise market cornered.
[244:09.98]Then, two years ago, he just vanished off the radar.
[244:13.88]His adopted American-bred, cocky, insolent son, Leland Shen, took control, and suddenly all bets are off.
[244:21.26]Shen voided all Benny's agreements, began extorting local businesses, but worst of all, he brought the sweatshops back to Chinatown.
[244:29.63]See, this kid Shen is one brutal son of... Oh, no, that's not good.
[244:34.29]What happened?
[244:35.07]...of a bitch.
[244:36.15]He's got... Okay, sorry.
[244:38.41]That was a little bit of a hiccup, and then I had to click, and then we skipped it.
[244:41.41]Sorry, Walken.
[244:44.28]You can get the gist of it, though.
[244:48.50]Your previously saved game would be lost, yeah.
[244:53.89]Locate the goth club.
[244:55.65]Got it.
[244:57.65]These things are terrible.
[244:58.65]I don't want these anymore.
[245:00.34]Got it.
[245:01.04]Let's go.
[245:24.96]Car is in mint condition.
[245:26.44]Yes.
[245:28.06]Sure is.
[245:31.41]Actually, one bump and this is going to blow.
[245:33.77]So I should probably be careful about it.
[245:39.57]How long do I plan on streaming?
[245:40.89]Probably not for much longer.
[245:43.81]I would say maybe like another 30, 40 minutes, maybe?
[245:46.11]Get to like 5 hours and call it a night.
[245:51.91]Something like that, maybe?
[245:55.87]Wait, that's the bad guy.
[246:02.63]Isn't that the bad guy from earlier?
[246:07.03]We have a bunch of indicators here now.
[246:09.00]With purple.
[246:14.00]Sizzle chest?
[246:15.78]I gotta ditch this.
[246:20.76]I gotta ditch this now, actually.
[246:27.49]Trying to be a bad person, but the game doesn't want me to, so I'm not gonna do it.
[246:32.36]You know how easy?
[246:32.94]Just thinking about this.
[246:48.81]That's when he walked up to you at a red light and was like, Police!
[246:52.35]Open the door!
[246:53.07]I need the car!
[246:53.79]And you're like, Yes, officer!
[246:54.79]Take it!
[246:55.11]And then just a criminal that just stole your car.
[246:58.36]They're not actually a police officer.
[247:03.90]How do you know?
[247:06.32]Jesus.
[247:10.05]I marked the perp.
[247:10.73]He's ours.
[247:11.67]Damn, this motherfucker's hard or easy.
[247:13.69]Your choice.
[247:19.26]Yep.
[247:40.69]You actually can use people's body parts as a weapon.
[247:50.30]Club security, I'm gonna go help.
[247:55.09]Drunken Bob's gonna get beat up with somebody's bloody leg.
[248:04.11]Although I can't get in a car, so maybe I should just dump this.
[248:08.40]Hey, you wanna get grossed out?
[248:11.62]Wow, that was fast.
[248:12.66]Let's go gross this guy out.
[248:18.71]Oh, come on.
[248:19.29]Why is it doing that weird trajectory?
[248:27.29]Is this an emulator at three times speed?
[248:37.60]It very well is.
[248:39.28]It very well is.
[248:39.98]I can't stop it.
[248:42.52]Now we have to figure out if it's worth playing on the other side.
[248:50.10]So is the purple the new mission that I have the new timeline to play on?
[248:59.70]Again, no, I'm going the right way.
[249:04.60]No more wrong side of the road bullshit.
[249:10.00]Double tap space.
[249:18.15]Oh, that's the car.
[249:24.87]Why is it so quiet?
[249:25.95]It shouldn't be that quiet.
[249:29.92]Yeah, so if you turn in, whatever direction you're turning in, you can do a big fishtail.
[249:35.72]Dispatch to patrol.
[249:37.54]Call 10-10.
[249:38.68]Mugging suspect reported seen in your area.
[249:41.10]Approach with caution.
[249:42.16]Over.
[249:43.60]That's cool.
[249:44.04]It's an easy way to turn around.
[249:47.31]Hey!
[249:51.57]Am I going the wrong way?
[249:52.53]I mean, there really is no wrong way.
[249:54.68]I'm just gonna go to, like, get to a marker.
[249:58.60]There we go.
[250:00.36]Another mentally unstable arsonist.
[250:02.62]What side of the road is he on?
[250:09.61]Is he on this side?
[250:10.29]Wait, where is he?
[250:14.43]He's on the left side of the road.
[250:18.27]Which one of these guys is it?
[250:21.95]Corner?
[250:26.81]Who is it?
[250:27.29]Is it that guy?
[250:28.61]Usually they have a thing on their head.
[250:34.65]What the hell?
[250:35.45]It is that guy, okay.
[250:39.76]Yo, peep this!
[250:44.00]What's he gonna do?
[250:48.48]He always goes for me.
[250:49.72]Why go for me every time?
[250:53.50]Eventually, he's gonna be the... What does that... You have a flamethrower.
[251:06.32]Put it down.
[251:06.86]Put it down.
[251:07.66]Put him down.
[251:08.10]I almost just walked into that.
[251:14.85]Give me that.
[251:15.27]Where is it?
[251:20.85]I would've just walked into that and died.
[251:23.53]Oh god, I didn't.
[251:24.59]I didn't drop it though.
[251:25.57]Oh my god, no!
[251:27.17]Fuckin' shi- Why are you a new guy to me?
[251:29.03]Concealed carry flamethrower.
[251:30.31]Well, he was an arsonist.
[251:31.05]Although, I'm gonna die if I get in a car accident.
[251:32.60]Nobody touches me.
[251:33.24]Police officer, I need your vehicle!
[251:34.38]Miralo!
[251:34.54]Damn!
[251:54.38]Alright, let's go.
[252:02.92]No, so what is this?
[252:06.65]Fist?
[252:08.77]CBGB.
[252:10.41]Oh my fucking god.
[252:15.59]Okay, instigate bar fight.
[252:20.23]Alright, so, what do you guys have to say?
[252:22.95]Hey, what's going on, shoulders?
[252:25.21]Yeah, you're a real punk.
[252:27.17]What the fuck are you doing, asshole?
[252:29.21]What the heck?
[252:30.77]What the hell?
[252:31.89]Get your hands up!
[252:35.37]Do you mean that like in a rock concert kind of way, or do you mean that in a you're gonna get hurt kind of way?
[252:41.88]I'll smear you on the wall!
[252:45.98]Forza Avanti!
[252:46.86]Forza Avanti!
[252:47.73]Forza Avanti!
[252:48.61]Forza Avanti!
[252:49.19]Forza Avanti!
[253:09.52]This is a mess.
[253:11.36]You guys are making it look easy.
[253:13.34]Get on him.
[253:14.52]You guys are making it look easy.
[253:17.55]I want to hurt him.
[253:24.23]What are you waiting for?
[253:25.47]Kill him already.
[253:26.59]That's it.
[253:27.41]Fuck him up.
[253:29.31]This guy's a lot of help.
[253:33.25]You guys are making it look easy.
[253:35.63]What are you waiting for?
[253:37.11]Forza avanti.
[253:40.51]Forza avanti.
[253:41.99]Forza.
[253:42.59]Shut up.
[253:43.33]Please.
[253:44.07]You're just making it harder for me.
[253:45.98]I can't even pay attention.
[253:48.40]Whoop his ass.
[253:50.97]Give me the mic stand.
[253:51.65]Why is it only this one guy?
[253:53.29]I don't understand.
[253:54.29]Is it the concert?
[253:54.89]The rock guy?
[253:55.57]The guy's on stage.
[254:13.00]Okay, you definitely saw blood there.
[254:15.86]I ran out of gas.
[254:42.38]Okay, so that was fun anything else that you'd like me to do Alright Better watch low-walking manager
[255:11.01]Did he say three seconds?
[255:13.01]Three seconds, ten rounds.
[255:14.75]You get one punch.
[255:34.13]Hello, boy.
[255:36.48]Alright, how did- I don't know how I did- Fucking goddamn karma is seriously coming back every time.
[255:45.00]Oh, poisoning.
[255:51.01]Okay, we need to see that.
[255:55.93]That's fairly important.
[256:00.21]You always gotta check out the ones we have not seen.
[256:04.22]Could be interesting.
[256:16.38]We're both on the bike.
[256:21.38]Why are you... I'm not even controlling the bike.
[256:27.48]Yes, I am.
[256:28.14]He doesn't understand what happened yet.
[256:31.12]Alright, sharing a bike with a friend.
[256:34.40]Let's take a stroll.
[256:35.58]Where would you like to go?
[256:36.50]Let's go get some ice cream.
[256:40.08]At least I got it.
[256:46.08]Now he's not on it anymore.
[256:47.18]That's good.
[256:51.88]You big fuck.
[256:53.90]Gotta get my strength up.
[256:59.64]Is that really the one thing?
[257:01.30]The parking meter is the thing that does it to me?
[257:05.58]This is so fucking fun.
[257:08.86]Just get on a fucking- Get in something that's indestructible.
[257:15.06]Good luck.
[257:16.86]Indestructible.
[257:17.82]Wraparound.
[257:18.32]Over here.
[257:18.54]What the hell?
[257:19.30]Police!
[257:29.24]There.
[257:33.24]What?
[257:33.50]No, get out.
[257:37.62]Green marker.
[257:42.56]This is dangerous.
[257:43.52]This is like a claw.
[257:45.48]Jesus!
[257:46.65]I wish I grabbed that guy.
[257:48.75]Yow!
[257:50.13]Physics did not make sense on that one.
[257:51.43]I should not have been able to squeeze through those people.
[257:54.61]And definitely not supposed to fit through this either.
[257:57.86]You enjoying your convention?
[258:16.55]No more of that.
[258:17.17]I'm gonna get the bad police boy award.
[258:19.51]I don't want that.
[258:22.77]Enough.
[258:23.83]Seriously, enough.
[258:31.61]Get on the highway.
[258:32.31]Put it on.
[258:45.53]Oh, shit.
[258:47.75]Really, I was trying to jump off and save the day.
[258:49.51]I actually do have to jump off and save the day, don't I?
[258:51.39]Yeah, I gotta get out of this.
[258:57.83]Can I get on the roof?
[259:00.48]It's possible.
[259:01.50]Go under.
[259:01.97]Let me try.
[259:07.19]I think it's possible.
[259:07.91]Give me a minute.
[259:09.81]Complete stop.
[259:10.45]Let's double-double.
[259:11.17]Let's double-double-double.
[259:16.07]This is gonna blow up.
[259:22.89]Damn it!
[259:23.57]Wait a minute.
[259:24.07]Wait a minute.
[259:24.77]Wait a minute.
[259:25.17]Wait a minute.
[259:27.37]Hold on a second, guys.
[259:29.19]Fuck.
[259:29.57]I have an idea.
[259:33.55]Idea.
[259:35.64]I'm gonna jump from there onto the roof.
[259:38.72]Can another car come on this highway?
[259:46.00]I'm going from here to the roof.
[259:50.05]I just need to park a car back here so I can jump from there to there.
[259:52.69]That really is too bad that I can't flip this.
[259:57.93]Can I not just turn it?
[259:58.81]Can I not push it?
[259:59.97]No.
[260:01.80]Shit.
[260:02.08]Come on.
[260:02.32]Where's another car?
[260:02.96]Get up here.
[260:06.00]I gotta get on the roof, this is important.
[260:10.58]Not one other car is gonna come up on this bridge.
[260:15.66]I'm not gonna do it from here.
[260:21.53]No, I can't.
[260:26.43]Well, I need to go find a car, because I need to try to get on the roof.
[260:31.52]I don't want it to despawn, so I want to look at it the whole time.
[260:35.59]Car?
[260:36.71]No.
[260:38.77]Don't despawn.
[260:46.09]The game is fighting me sa- aaaah!
[260:51.09]The game wanted it to despawn.
[261:01.12]Where is this guy?
[261:08.12]Might be able to just do that with a regular car.
[261:10.50]Going fast enough.
[261:11.16]I'm gonna try it.
[261:14.69]Worth a shot, right?
[261:17.47]Try to get a fast car and... stuff over that as fast as you can and dump out.
[261:24.87]Oh, that's actually... here we go.
[261:26.37]There's another one.
[261:28.37]I'll try this one.
[261:30.73]I'll take this one.
[261:32.67]You better hope I don't fuck it up too bad.
[261:38.20]Okay, so, let's try it again.
[261:40.62]There's the building.
[261:50.19]Right up here.
[261:52.53]Okay.
[261:53.95]Wish me luck.
[261:56.25]I'm gonna try to get it just hanging over the edge.
[262:09.78]Almost.
[262:12.98]Right on the corner.
[262:15.95]Complete stop.
[262:17.23]Punch it.
[262:21.03]It's so close.
[262:22.41]But wait.
[262:23.07]But wait.
[262:31.66]Damn it.
[262:32.00]Come on.
[262:34.26]I thought I could just jump on it.
[262:37.72]Watch where you walk.
[262:41.46]Looks like it pushes to the left, so yeah.
[262:43.34]It pushes to the left.
[262:44.98]Why'd you go straight over here?
[262:46.13]Got it.
[262:48.33]Nice and easy.
[262:49.25]Hold on.
[262:49.75]Okay.
[262:50.23]Stay there.
[263:10.21]Hmph.
[263:10.79]I bet this is it.
[263:19.35]Excuse me.
[263:20.65]Can't let you bring that in.
[263:22.29]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[263:23.53]You seen Vivian Shin?
[263:30.65]You Vivian?
[263:31.76]Who the hell are you?
[263:33.14]The hip-hop club's up the street.
[263:36.02]Just a friend.
[263:37.16]Come to take you home.
[263:38.46]I hate my home.
[263:40.19]That ain't my problem.
[263:41.71]Now let's go.
[263:42.15]Excuse me.
[263:43.85]Vivian belongs to me.
[263:45.47]Damn.
[263:47.51]You got some taste, girl.
[263:48.95]Who do you think you are, mortal?
[263:51.52]I'm the man who's gonna knock those plastic fangs down your throat.
[263:54.98]I will show you how vampire fight.
[263:59.28]No, really.
[264:01.36]He's in the cage.
[264:02.20]Defeat the ghost.
[264:03.10]Oh, God.
[264:03.51]You're dead, come mierda.
[264:11.53]Evidence?
[264:13.57]What are they throwing at me?
[264:16.55]Ah, that's what I'm talking about.
[264:18.86]I'm so... My character's locked into the safe right now.
[264:22.60]They're hitting me with skulls and shit.
[264:26.78]Block, block, block.
[264:28.40]And face the right way.
[264:34.87]They're gonna kick your ass.
[264:36.99]Are they?
[264:42.81]Is he the leader?
[264:43.39]No, he's like on the sideline somewhere.
[264:48.47]Give me that thing.
[264:49.33]Oh my god.
[264:51.19]I'm getting fucking destroyed.
[264:53.83]Give me something to attack with.
[264:56.07]Thank you.
[264:58.31]You got a weapon?
[265:00.65]That was an instant kill.
[265:12.35]Don't get surrounded.
[265:18.96]They're gonna kick your ass.
[265:20.54]Why is a casket coming?
[265:22.88]Attack my creatures of the night.
[265:24.76]Attack!
[265:25.06]Oh, please.
[265:26.73]Really?
[265:28.21]What?
[265:28.45]Hey!
[265:29.85]Hey!
[265:30.57]I feel like shit!
[265:35.35]How come they get these things?
[265:39.16]Be careful.
[265:40.16]Give me that knife.
[265:42.48]Got it.
[265:42.78]No, no fire.
[265:43.48]Is there health around here?
[265:45.56]There it is.
[265:46.86]Got it.
[265:47.32]We both missed.
[266:06.23]Need more knives right here.
[266:08.07]Another knife.
[266:09.75]I know there's another one hanging out somewhere.
[266:20.72]No, don't kick the stuff.
[266:22.00]Pick up a knife.
[266:23.94]Oh, for the love of God, just kick his ass.
[266:28.93]Don't even let him up.
[266:30.72]They're gonna kick your ass.
[266:32.74]Got him.
[266:33.60]Okay, okay, stop already.
[266:34.96]You proved your point.
[266:36.10]Fine, let's get out of here.
[266:39.82]Oh, easy.
[266:40.66]Easy, lady.
[266:41.24]More evidence?
[266:44.11]Yeah.
[266:46.69]I think I got them all.
[266:47.61]I could arrest everybody, too.
[266:50.15]Get some good boy points.
[266:53.31]I get so many bad boy points.
[266:55.23]We have to get a few good ones, right?
[266:57.71]I love sending bitches to the joint.
[267:03.73]Don't worry.
[267:04.05]We're getting 20 good boy points.
[267:05.89]We're going to run over one person and be over.
[267:07.61]It's going to be completely done.
[267:08.87]What the hell am I doing?
[267:14.60]Okay, that's fine.
[267:15.36]Let's get out of here.
[267:22.85]What were they doing that was illegal?
[267:24.47]Nothing, I guess.
[267:25.51]I guess they, well, I mean, technically.
[267:27.15]You're going to tell me where you live.
[267:28.51]I need to talk to your brother.
[267:30.25]Oh, so you're using me to get to him?
[267:32.67]What are you really after?
[267:34.55]Grown-up business.
[267:35.43]You wouldn't understand.
[267:36.45]What the fuck is my life?
[267:41.36]What?
[267:42.68]Are you crazy?
[267:43.64]I arrested all of them.
[267:44.86]I'll tell you where I live.
[267:46.16]Just get me out of here.
[267:47.60]No, you drive, I shoot.
[267:51.29]They all got out of their handcuffs.
[267:52.43]Well, they are like... No, this is going to be... Well, they're bad.
[268:08.50]That's going to blow up.
[268:11.08]Don't get that close.
[268:11.83]Oh, shit!
[268:13.03]It looks like I grabbed Dimitri's limo.
[268:18.21]I see a lot of stuff back there.
[268:20.23]It's up to you.
[268:21.15]What if I shot her?
[268:34.12]I'm trying.
[268:36.14]You can't just drive in a straight line.
[268:43.27]I'm not even shooting.
[268:44.83]I can't stop shooting guns.
[268:46.89]Bad, bad, bad.
[268:49.31]I stopped shooting guns.
[268:55.09]I would say the same thing.
[269:00.89]Are we going for a jump?
[269:02.19]Oh, that was cool.
[269:05.57]They didn't make it.
[269:06.11]They didn't have a fast enough car.
[269:09.39]Do you have to be so brutal?
[269:13.78]Jesus!
[269:14.82]Die!
[269:16.10]The car's about to be smoking.
[269:21.95]They drive so close to each other.
[269:29.09]Whip her out.
[269:29.61]I think we did it.
[269:51.84]We are in deep shit.
[269:54.90]Why?
[269:55.24]What the fuck?
[270:00.02]Alright, slow down.
[270:01.42]Think about this.
[270:02.11]I gotta... God, fuck.
[270:02.69]Try this again.
[270:21.03]Here they come again.
[270:23.75]Shoot him!
[270:24.05]Shoot the gun!
[270:24.59]How is this guy alive?
[270:51.33]This is probably the hardest thing I've ever done.
[270:56.57]Shooting guns in this game, especially... We're already smoking.
[270:59.47]I'm gonna die again.
[271:07.30]The gun also shoots itself.
[271:08.50]For instance, I will turn my webcam on and show you guys that I'm not even turning it on.
[271:16.18]This is doing it.
[271:17.18]This is fun.
[271:23.68]I can't aim at him!
[271:25.78]I think I'm doing okay.
[271:31.57]We have bikes coming out of nowhere from right here, right?
[271:43.79]Oh my god!
[271:57.60]Where are they?
[271:58.98]We drive right into them.
[272:24.36]so paranoid auto lock my auto lock is auto locking on the front of their tires so I have to unload like four clips to make them explode my life is insane
[272:59.47]That just did so much damage to the goddamn car.
[273:01.66]Shoot the driver?
[273:05.06]You see that?
[273:05.60]I'm gonna tell you, this is a thousand times harder than it looks.
[273:09.54]Shoot the gun!
[273:12.56]Oh my god.
[273:13.16]We're already dead.
[273:29.24]And now I... Stop firing!
[273:31.04]Stop firing the guns!
[273:33.10]Holy shit, I got it to work.
[273:33.98]What do I do?
[273:34.60]Don't reload, I get it.
[273:39.23]Oh, man.
[273:39.99]Not good.
[273:41.59]Not good.
[273:58.00]I have a grenade launcher?
[273:59.18]I would love to see where it is.
[274:02.56]Alright, I'm gonna tell you guys right now.
[274:20.43]I cannot switch to a grenade launcher.
[274:23.03]It does not exist.
[274:28.22]Freaking out right now about the grenade launcher.
[274:30.54]I got no buttons.
[274:31.86]I did nothing work.
[274:33.16]All I got is a machine gun.
[274:37.56]That's all I have.
[274:39.02]I promise.
[274:47.53]It's an attachment.
[274:48.95]What do you mean it's an attachment?
[274:50.87]Alt fire?
[274:53.27]I'm pressing every button I have.
[274:56.15]My life is fucking insane.
[275:00.91]Let me- Hold on.
[275:02.67]Do I have- Can I look at the gun that I have?
[275:08.04]If one person said this is a grenade launcher, it has to be true.
[275:11.10]Motherfu- Fuck.
[275:13.84]Oh, fuck.
[275:16.72]It's Hermann's weapon supplier.
[275:19.62]I see a lot of stuff back there.
[275:21.43]It's up to you.
[275:33.77]I don't know if I can do this, but... I'm already, like, with... It's already spoken.
[275:45.56]It's in the picture?
[275:52.21]Well, uh, they must have drawn it from incorrect...
[276:01.89]There's too many extra frames for them to shoot the car
[276:34.45]I have to go in the limo?
[276:45.35]Okay, well... Um... This is not quite the... This is the sun.
[276:55.86]So, um... Why don't we take a look around?
[276:59.34]And see where we are.
[277:01.84]Okay, well, we're... There, we just had an avatar.
[277:09.99]I don't think I can go anywhere else.
[277:17.28]Does it still think I'm in the car?
[277:18.52]What if I press E?
[277:19.84]Can I jump?
[277:20.34]I cannot move.
[277:27.01]Can't move.
[277:27.89]Can't crouch.
[277:28.49]I wonder if I can like look down maybe?
[277:34.67]No.
[277:35.83]We're here forever.
[277:40.12]We made it to the moon.
[277:44.76]Where's the scary developer console thing where I can blow up the moon?
[277:54.87]Grenade launcher unlocked screen.
[277:59.71]No.
[278:00.17]Is the car taking damage?
[278:02.01]What happens if the car explodes while I'm up here?
[278:06.31]This is a Dark Souls boss room.
[278:11.07]I think I beat the game.
[278:14.31]Well, I think I found the time as any to call the stream for the night.
[278:26.38]It's fun.
[278:30.80]Wait a minute, can I fast travel or something?
[278:35.14]Can I do anything from the menu?
[278:42.52]I wish I had a grenade, man.
[278:43.60]I really do.
[278:44.12]I would just blow myself up right now.
[278:50.81]Press every button.
[278:51.53]See what happens.
[278:52.85]Find the grenade.
[278:55.51]What was that?
[278:56.83]What was that?
[278:58.05]Oh.
[278:59.23]What was that?
[279:01.49]Okay, now that was reloading.
[279:02.63]I really thought I found the grenade launcher.
[279:03.99]I was about to be so aggravated.
[279:10.89]Reload.
[279:14.24]City map.
[279:15.34]Player options.
[279:16.44]No, it's here.
[279:17.16]Save load.
[279:18.88]If you load this save game... Do not save the game here, please.
[279:24.18]I would like to load the game.
[279:27.56]Load.
[279:28.74]Loading game.
[279:32.19]Wow!
[279:32.83]Where is this?
[279:34.19]Where is this?
[279:36.17]This is far away!
[279:37.99]Why is it this far away?
[279:39.41]Huh?
[279:46.92]We've saved the game like 15 times since here.
[279:49.23]40 fucking minutes ago?
[280:18.59]No, because we didn't even collect our money, did we?
[280:20.59]This is the first time we did this.
[280:22.49]Oh, wait a minute.
[280:25.21]Okay.
[280:26.19]See you.
[280:27.68]We're fine.
[280:29.60]Holy shit, that would have been bad.
[280:33.68]Okay, that's fine.
[280:42.07]It's before the goth attack.
[280:43.29]Okay.
[280:43.81]Alright.
[280:44.41]Everything's fine.
[280:45.15]Everybody calm down.
[280:47.69]I just saw the... I thought that was an hour and a half ago.
[280:50.51]To be fair, most of the time on this mission, I was trying to get on the roof.
[280:52.91]It's true.
[280:53.25]You're right.
[280:53.61]Yeah, I thought it was before they operated as well.
[280:55.85]I was about to be so scared.
[280:57.55]But that's probably a good time to call it.
[281:17.49]Just under five hours.
[281:22.47]We'll read the bits, do the credits.
[281:24.72]And we're going to play this again.
[281:26.38]We're going to pick this back up on Thursday.
[281:29.74]And then on Saturday is the detective stream.
[281:32.92]I hope you have prepared.
[281:34.90]I hope you've studied the chat.
[281:36.95]Yeah, lots of Motorola product placement.
[281:40.43]What the heck?
[281:46.80]see how mad that was alright just a good place to stop we will be doing this again on Thursday I would assume we'll probably come close to beating it I can't imagine this is more than an eight to ten hour game so thanks for sticking around I'll see you guys on Thursday and we're gonna do the bits
[282:11.60]Skip and play Sleeping Dogs.
[282:12.72]Well, we're doing them all.
[282:13.84]We did.
[282:14.24]We beat the LA one.
[282:16.50]We're going to beat the New York one.
[282:18.56]And then we're going to move on to Sleeping Dogs, which is the spiritual third one in the series.
[282:25.17]So I'd like to do them all because there's a lot of interesting things that are happening in all these games.
[282:30.99]Plenty of fun material.
[282:32.09]And oh, by the way, before you leave, if you're still here, we're going to do a poll.
[282:37.92]Do you want me to try to play the game Thursday?
[282:41.66]in normal mode, or should we just, are we too used to it at this point to stay?
[282:45.29]Let's see what you guys want to do.
[282:47.79]I'm willing to give it a try, but if I, remember, keep in mind here, if I give this a try, and I get it to lock to 60 frames or 30 frames or something, I might not be able to turn it off.
[282:58.43]So we might have to play at the normal frame rate.
[283:04.80]Stay in speed mode or
[283:12.25]Attempt normal mode.
[283:13.99]Let's see what we get.
[283:17.17]There you go.
[283:23.79]Let's see what happens at the end of the credits and bits and everything.
[283:28.60]Thank you for watching, everybody.
[283:30.50]If you've taken off, see you on Thursday.
[283:32.26]Much love to you.
[283:34.14]Much respect.
[283:36.30]And let's run the credits.

[286:26.67]The music ran out.
[286:28.89]By the way, some of those were $25 subs.
[286:34.12]And you get this shitty fucking meme.
[286:36.20]Congratulations to the people that did that.
[286:40.47]god thank you though guys I appreciate it thank you for something thanks for staying subbed for as long as a lot of you guys have been subbed take care and let's get to the bits see what we got tonight here we go we got go back we got a lot to go through we got a lot
[287:04.86]So, from earlier tonight, we're going to start before time, you know.
[287:11.09]By the way, hold on.
[287:11.67]I'm curious.
[287:17.83]What is fentanyl?
[287:20.50]Is it an oil for your car?
[287:22.34]That's like a gas, right?
[287:24.32]You put that in like Valvoline?
[287:25.90]Fentanyl?
[287:28.44]Nope.
[287:28.76]This is a drug.
[287:29.94]Okay.
[287:31.87]Anyways.
[287:33.46]Thank you to... Uh... Thank you to... Soup or Seal.
[287:42.05]The Nintendo Labo comes out in three days.
[287:44.57]Is it possible we'll get a Nintendo Labo stream?
[287:47.71]Yeah, I'm thinking about it.
[287:49.55]We got the detective stream to do, so I'm gonna do my shitty Nintendo Labo stream, like, probably a week later.
[287:54.20]Because I have to do a lot of setup for it.
[287:57.30]Uh, Spreo, thanks for the $1.
[287:58.32]Here you go, Comcast.
[288:00.60]Please don't do it this time.
[288:01.62]We actually had a pretty...
[288:04.41]The stream was immaculate the whole time.
[288:07.45]Zero dropped frames in five hours.
[288:09.17]That's... I've not seen that for at least three months.
[288:14.91]So that's encouraging.
[288:15.97]Hopefully it sticks around.
[288:16.87]Thanks, though, dude.
[288:20.55]Thank you to Moto Danny for the three bucks.
[288:23.01]Is it true... Is this the true Crime Streets of New York Choose Your Own Adventure book?
[288:28.37]Technically, it's kind of, right?
[288:32.05]Yeah, it's not gonna be a real Labo stream.
[288:33.51]It's gonna be a joke.
[288:34.53]Like, I'm just... Remember we talked about the pizza box bullshit?
[288:37.49]Like, it'll be like a 14-minute stream.
[288:42.05]This music is so pleasant.
[288:43.09]What is it from?
[288:43.69]This is an original track from Blordau.
[288:48.45]If you could link somebody.
[288:51.97]Blordau.
[288:53.49]He also is the one that has animated this screen.
[288:56.37]He's done all the artwork, all the animation for the Jerma in quotations brand.
[289:03.64]He did the J. He did the music.
[289:06.24]He's a very talented guy.
[289:07.20]I recommend you give him a follow and you go check out his other work.
[289:10.40]He's a very, very good dude.
[289:15.48]But, uh, thank you.
[289:16.84]Thank you, Radioactive Toaster, for the $5.75.
[289:19.38]Might not be able to catch full stream, but I want to give a small token of appreciation for the years of laughter.
[289:24.27]Found you through the Grab That Auto video.
[289:27.41]And since then, you've made me smile in my darkest of days.
[289:30.01]Thank you.
[289:31.07]And I can't wait for your next live-action project.
[289:34.37]Very soon.
[289:35.65]Very soon.
[289:36.61]Sooner than you think.
[289:37.41]Very soon.
[289:39.07]Thank you, Dole.
[289:40.01]Ready, whacked, and rooster.
[289:40.75]Appreciate it.
[289:43.67]T-Dog, the man.
[289:44.77]Thanks for the five dollars.
[289:46.59]Let me just welcome back jermaEarth real quick.
[289:48.76]And welcome some new emotes to the emote family.
[289:52.20]Jerma Bald and Jerma Plue.
[289:54.02]Yeah.
[289:56.08]We got four new emotes.
[289:58.82]One is obnoxiously expensive.
[290:03.84]You know.
[290:05.35]It's funny because the one with the $9.99 sub emote is going to be awesome.
[290:09.93]The $25 sub emote is awful.
[290:12.15]But the one right before it, the tier before it, is going to be so cool.
[290:15.25]It's going to be a golden beer.
[290:17.11]With burning, bright, shining eyes.
[290:22.24]So, you know, that was the one idea that I had for the $10 emote.
[290:25.88]Schwartz, thanks for the $5.00.
[290:33.75]Did you know that Twitch Prime users get their first 500 bits for only 99 cents?
[290:39.37]By the way, love the new emotes.
[290:42.85]I did not know that.
[290:43.45]That's interesting.
[290:46.29]So that's five bucks worth of bits for a dollar.
[290:49.30]That's cool.
[290:50.88]Thank you for... I'm going to assume this is... You're giving me the $5.99 deal here.
[290:55.30]Thank you.
[290:59.31]You know, it very well could be, because I can only draw four different things.
[291:02.23]I can draw that, and I can write my name.
[291:04.30]So two things.
[291:23.46]Thank you, Anthony 1215 for the $5.
[291:25.58]Hey, Jerma, I woke up today and my girlfriend broke up with me.
[291:29.46]I spent the day cleaning and trying to get work done.
[291:31.81]Sorry about the funerals, but thanks for helping me crack a smile.
[291:35.07]Your videos are always a go-to when I need to feel better.
[291:38.99]Sorry about that, man.
[291:41.09]That's not fun ever to deal with.
[291:44.65]But you are actually doing something that's considered therapeutic and not a bad idea.
[291:49.77]Just taking your mind off of it.
[291:51.55]Cleaning.
[291:52.53]Trying to get some stuff done.
[291:53.81]Keeping your head down.
[291:54.43]Getting work done.
[291:56.15]So that is not a bad idea.
[291:59.25]But I appreciate the thought from you there about the funerals because that sucked.
[292:05.20]So thank you, Anthony.
[292:07.68]Much love to you.
[292:08.34]Hopefully shit works out for you.
[292:12.49]Horace2, thanks for the $2.
[292:15.61]No message, just cheer.
[292:16.63]Thank you.
[292:17.67]IrishGuy, thanks for the $5.
[292:20.82]Glad to have you back, Jerma.
[292:21.94]Had a loss in the family recently, so I can relate to all the funeral nonsense.
[292:26.44]Yeah.
[292:28.19]Yeah, and I don't really want to go into detail of the two different people that passed away the last week.
[292:34.47]Because obviously, with respect to their families, I don't want to turn it into a... You know, hey, let's talk about this on stream.
[292:40.22]It's not my family, and it's not my business to talk about that, so...
[292:47.18]Uh, just know that two people that, uh, my family and I have known for a very long time, two of them passed away last week, and I don't really want to give that much attention to who they were, or all that stuff, right?
[292:59.99]But, um, thank you, Irish guy, I appreciate it.
[293:04.17]Radio Vidya, thanks for the five dollars.
[293:07.49]Appreciate it.
[293:07.93]Oh, and by the way, I'm sorry for your loss as well.
[293:11.44]You lost somebody in your family too, so...
[293:15.03]That's never a fun thing to do.
[293:17.25]It sucks.
[293:19.76]So, my condolences to you.
[293:21.56]I don't know how recently somebody may have passed away, but condolences to you.
[293:26.30]Much love to you, man.
[293:28.82]But, yeah, Radio Ovidia, thanks for the $5.
[293:31.29]There once was a man from Nantucket who's
[293:44.01]Dick was so long he could suck it.
[293:46.27]Why did I even spend the time to not read it?
[293:50.39]How compulsive am I?
[293:52.23]What a compulsive fucking moron.
[293:54.71]I spent the time to read it and said no.
[293:57.64]And then my brain said yes.
[293:58.82]And then they say Jerma expensive.
[294:00.14]And they talked about fucking somebody's ear.
[294:03.00]Thanks for the $5 radio.
[294:06.26]I even had time to not do it.
[294:08.38]I felt my body saying no that whole time.
[294:11.96]I was gonna just move on.
[294:13.44]Ah, thank you, Styx, for the $5.
[294:14.66]Can I get the expensive emote, please?
[294:19.16]It's $25 a month.
[294:22.60]That is four Netflix subscriptions.
[294:27.37]It's not worth it.
[294:29.25]It is not worth it.
[294:31.51]Don't buy it.
[294:32.85]It's just there because I saw that it existed and I want to fill all my emote slots.
[294:40.00]So no, it's not worth $25 a month for that terrible fucking drawing on a gray background.
[294:48.53]That's $300 a year.
[294:53.99]You know what you can buy for $300 a year?
[295:00.86]You could buy...
[295:05.36]You could get like a PSVR instead of having a stupid shit emote.
[295:10.88]Oh my god, somebody just did it.
[295:14.74]Reverse psychology.
[295:17.68]Yeah, we're gonna have to do Jerma cheap.
[295:20.54]But I don't know, yeah.
[295:21.46]How does that work?
[295:22.60]I got one for you actually right now.
[295:25.31]Uh-huh.
[295:26.43]It's an emote that I put in the trash can.
[295:28.27]I'm gonna upload it right now on stream.
[295:29.95]I don't know if you... I tried to make... Yeah, this is Jerma cheap.
[295:35.54]This was supposed to be a Jerma Comcast or a Jerma Internet.
[295:38.68]It's supposed to be my face getting like shot a lightning bolt through and it's my face in like five different directions.
[295:44.00]It just looks like shit.
[295:45.32]You can't even tell what it is.
[295:46.36]It's just Jerma, Jerma cheap.
[295:48.44]I'm uploading it right now.
[295:51.43]That's gonna get it.
[295:53.77]I'm gonna, I abandoned it.
[295:55.59]I spent like 45 minutes on this and then just deleted it.
[296:00.11]But I didn't delete it.
[296:00.81]I saved it because I was gonna try to salvage it.
[296:02.45]So I'm gonna, here you go.
[296:07.19]It's even named on Photoshop, awful.psd.
[296:12.29]This thing is so fucking bad.
[296:14.67]Alright, here.
[296:17.95]You ready for like a Photoshop stream?
[296:20.51]Let's capture this window.
[296:29.49]This is what it's supposed to look like.
[296:35.84]Open this like that.
[296:37.78]Hold on, I'll get it.
[296:41.56]Add window capture.
[296:46.86]There we go.
[296:47.54]Okay.
[296:52.16]There it is.
[296:56.04]That's the emote.
[296:57.72]It does not look like that when it's shrunk that much.
[297:03.61]That does not look the way you think it does.
[297:12.06]You want me to just upload it right now?
[297:13.40]That's Jerma cheap.
[297:14.44]You want that?
[297:14.92]You want to see what that looks like when it's tiny?
[297:17.90]Here, I'll show you.
[297:20.76]This is what it looks like when it's small.
[297:23.52]Good luck somebody deciphering what this is.
[297:30.55]Let's make it 28 by 28 pixels so you can understand what I'm talking about.
[297:33.77]Okay, so you see that?
[297:40.46]Nice.
[297:41.42]Let's go down a little bit.
[297:44.04]Oh, no.
[297:44.64]Okay, there we go.
[297:45.52]Still can kind of make out what this is.
[297:46.94]Alright.
[297:50.14]Let's keep going.
[297:52.37]Yeah.
[297:53.85]Having a little trouble now understanding what it is.
[297:56.95]Let's go down to what it's actually going to look like.
[298:02.60]That doesn't look like anything.
[298:03.92]It just looks like a ray of light.
[298:10.44]So, do you see how that's impossible to decipher what that is?
[298:13.92]It just looks like a yellow frog.
[298:15.48]It's just a mustard stain.
[298:28.49]No, you... Okay, this is gonna...
[298:32.19]I wish it was this big, you know?
[298:33.69]I wish I could... Maybe I should... No.
[298:40.33]Alright, well, this is what... You're getting it right now.
[298:43.29]Jerma sheep.
[298:47.78]Nobody actually wants this.
[298:49.12]I can feel it.
[298:50.24]Alright, whatever.
[298:50.70]It's coming.
[298:52.08]Hold on.
[298:54.98]I'm exporting it alright now.
[298:56.52]I'm not kidding.
[298:57.10]It's going up now.
[299:03.97]This might be deleted tomorrow afternoon.
[299:07.57]Do you want it to be called Jerma Cheap?
[299:09.64]Do you like that?
[299:10.34]Jerma Cheap?
[299:15.66]Hold on.
[299:16.14]Cheap 112.
[299:17.26]By the time we're... It's going to take about 20 minutes for you to be able to use it.
[299:26.22]Or Jerm Mustard.
[299:27.54]jermaMustard.
[299:30.57]We've got to get a couple of different names here.
[299:36.69]jermaMustard.
[299:37.61]Jerma Cheap.
[299:39.05]Jerma Light Ray.
[299:43.33]Jerma... Jerma Frog?
[299:48.11]jermaMustard?
[299:49.03]Is that what you guys want?
[299:52.28]I'll get a pole.

[299:58.64]Okay, this is... Hey, what the hell?

[300:20.87]There we go.
[300:21.31]Okay, hold on.
[300:22.78]I need to redo something.
[300:26.64]Hold on.
[300:27.04]There we go.
[300:29.66]Now it'll work.
[300:36.05]Jerma Baby?
[300:37.11]Jerma Piss?
[300:38.13]No.
[300:38.27]I'm not gonna be Jerma Piss.
[300:46.15]Why is it doing that shit?
[300:47.61]For some reason this is fucking up.
[300:52.10]Why is it giving me the white background?
[300:54.52]Oh, who cares?
[300:55.20]It's Jerma shit.
[300:58.78]Jerma Nebula?

[301:27.40]Export as.
[301:28.26]I don't give a shit if it's the right canvas size.
[301:32.04]Fuck off.
[301:38.81]It's really trying my patience right now.
[301:45.13]Oh, whatever.
[301:45.55]Let's see if it works.
[301:47.69]Jerma trash?
[301:48.75]Jerma awful?

[303:14.66]Yeah, or Jerma Stain.
[303:17.22]There we go, here are your choices.
[303:19.94]Take off my Aetherium Address.
[303:21.29]It's really ugly.
[303:23.15]I probably will, because only two people have ever used it, so.
[303:26.69]It's probably getting deleted tonight.
[303:28.65]There you go, Mustard Trash Sheet, Nebula Ray, Awful Stain.
[303:35.96]That's a lot of choices.
[303:37.98]A lot of trust, a lot of calories.
[303:41.34]While you do that, I'm gonna make sure it goes through real-time emote uploading.
[303:48.35]Go to my channel settings.
[303:51.41]By the time you guys get that done... Yeah.
[304:05.75]Well...

[304:33.96]How's it look?
[304:41.52]Let me see what we got here.
[304:43.60]Uh, looks like mustard is winning.
[304:45.76]It's gonna have to be jermaMustard, I think.
[304:48.73]Another few minutes.
[304:50.71]One more minute or so.
[304:53.69]While I try to troubleshoot why this isn't working.
[305:02.17]Why is this not doing it?
[305:03.11]Come on, it's- I got the right size.
[305:04.65]It is 28 by 28.
[305:08.95]What the fuck?
[305:11.91]Where is it?
[305:14.17]Why is it doing this shit to me right now?
[305:20.04]Right?
[305:20.82]This is 28 by 28.
[305:21.22]Why is it doing this shit?
[305:27.52]Let's save it as something else.
[305:33.30]You bastard program.
[305:34.99]By the way, can I just tell you?
[305:36.21]I hate Photoshop.
[305:38.87]Photoshop is the worst thing ever.
[305:47.18]Yeah, all the windows noises.
[305:48.18]Yeah, sorry I'm like being completely and totally not even listening.
[305:52.18]I'm trying so desperately to get this to work.
[305:55.90]There we go.
[305:56.84]Okay.
[306:00.20]I'm gonna have to fix it, but it'll work.
[306:03.84]Just not necessarily as intended at first.
[306:05.66]It should be there in about 20 minutes? 25?
[306:18.02]It's so fucking dumb.
[306:19.08]It just looks like I have a swirly haircut.
[306:27.68]So, what is it going to be for the last chance?
[306:30.06]Everyone, this is your last chance.
[306:31.08]You have 10 seconds before I make the decision.
[306:36.43]What is it going to be?
[306:41.75]Done.
[306:42.43]It's jermaMustard.
[306:43.27]Thank you for voting.
[306:53.93]Very cool.
[306:54.31]How do you spell mustard?
[306:57.53]Mustard, right?
[306:58.60]Mustard.
[306:59.84]Term of mustard.
[307:00.50]Here it comes.
[307:01.42]It's been submitted.
[307:04.64]Alright, I'm excited.
[307:13.40]No, it's mustard!
[307:18.66]It's not mustard.
[307:19.18]Mustard.
[307:21.75]It's Mustard.
[307:23.13]It's Mustard, right?
[307:29.09]Did I spell Mustard wrong on my emote?
[307:32.19]No, I didn't.
[307:35.09]No, it's Mustard.
[307:36.15]It's not Mustard.
[307:37.25]Alright, here it comes.
[307:43.55]Let's close out of that.
[307:49.06]Back to the bits.
[307:51.16]I can't wait till this goes through and I just look over and it's being spammed by everybody.
[307:56.70]Alright.
[307:57.80]The whole thing's making me hungry for hot dogs.
[307:59.10]Yeah, me too.
[308:00.40]Me too, dude.
[308:02.66]Alright, where did we... We left off somewhere here.
[308:07.57]Oh, right here.
[308:08.39]It was Stix.
[308:10.41]Somebody said, can I get the expensive emote?
[308:11.95]We just added another one on stream.
[308:14.19]Thank you, Stix.

[308:28.96]$0.99 giveaway.
[308:31.36]Thank you.

[308:51.93]Thank you.
[308:54.15]SirFeline, thanks for the $1.
[308:55.33]This is probably the best cop drama I've ever seen.

[309:01.45]Thank you.
[309:03.15]JoeyFettuccine, thanks for the $1.
[309:04.97]Bitslave, thanks for the $0.25.
[309:06.43]HeyMyMaster, I know you told me not to give you bits anymore, but I have stolen these.
[309:09.97]I haven't stolen these.
[309:10.79]I'm so used to you saying that.
[309:13.97]Instead I took up heavy drinking and I'm cashing in the bottles for small amounts.
[309:17.62]I hope you're happy.
[309:20.36]Then I know that I'm in the top 1,000 streamers.
[309:24.42]That's pretty cool.
[309:24.92]Where did you get that info?
[309:28.00]So I'm a top 1,000 man?
[309:31.16]What's my exact number?
[309:33.98]Where do I stand?
[309:38.44]Top 1,000.
[309:38.72]We made it?
[309:40.12]We made it!
[309:44.49]He made it up.
[309:52.55]He just made it up, and now I look like a dick.
[309:55.25]Thank you, Bitslave, again, for the 25 cents.
[309:56.79]Can I please have my old life back?
[309:58.23]Stealing for bits was my passion.
[309:59.47]I feel like a shell of my old self.
[310:01.07]No.
[310:02.39]Treefitty, thanks for the 25 cents.
[310:03.88]Hey, Jerry, Twitch has recently made it so I can only earn four bits a day for farming.
[310:08.14]So sorry this isn't a lot, but I just wanted to tell you, hi.
[310:11.12]Took me 12 and a half days to tell you that.
[310:15.44]Thanks, dude.
[310:15.90]Uh, thank you, Manboy, for the 25 cents.
[310:21.78]Excuse me, Mr. Jerma, have you seen Bitslave?
[310:24.59]There's a warrant out for his arrest.
[310:27.41]Yes, I have.
[310:28.77]He was here earlier.
[310:30.11]You should probably check and find him.
[310:33.63]S. Stapler, thanks for the $1.
[310:35.45]The narrator sounds like Garfield.
[310:37.07]There you got it, dude.
[310:41.29]Dask Cat Cohen, thanks for the $5.
[310:43.75]Cancel Christmas.
[310:46.35]Why would you need to do that?
[310:47.03]You don't have to.
[310:47.95]Thank you.
[310:51.41]Don't turn him in.
[310:52.57]He's right there.
[310:53.03]He's still here.
[310:53.46]He's right there.
[310:54.00]He's right there.
[310:56.40]Arrest that man.
[310:58.94]Thank you, Breach.
[310:59.82]Oh, Breach, for the 101.
[311:00.88]$1.01, dude.
[311:02.72]Thank you.
[311:04.46]A Dog Canada.
[311:06.02]Thanks for the 28 cents.
[311:07.78]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching your stuff since 2013, and I just wanted to say thanks for all the laughs over the years.
[311:13.02]Love from Canada.
[311:14.77]Also, can you make this an emote?
[311:16.09]Let's find out.
[311:18.47]No.
[311:23.43]No.
[311:26.57]I'll show you what he wants.
[311:28.43]And you can all see this will never be an emote.
[311:31.59]I would have to lose a pretty substantial bet for this to be an emote.
[311:35.35]You'll see.
[311:50.37]He wants this to be an emote.
[311:52.95]Nope.
[311:54.19]Not gonna happen.
[311:54.67]I'll have to lose a bet.
[312:00.43]Thanks for your consideration, though.
[312:04.33]Appreciate it.
[312:14.94]That's what you want?
[312:16.48]You want Jerma to snort
[312:19.43]Why would I put that in?
[312:20.51]That doesn't have any context to anything.
[312:24.40]Do you understand?
[312:26.06]There is no... Emotes are supposed to convey some kind of emotion, right?
[312:31.92]Let's go over all of them.
[312:33.42]All of my emotes.
[312:34.02]Let's talk about this.
[312:35.56]Germamoon signifies confidence and stoicism.
[312:41.51]Germamoon, it's the moon.
[312:43.11]It's out there.
[312:43.71]It gives energy.
[312:45.79]It's confidence.
[312:49.25]It's like a statue.
[312:50.73]Jerma's son represents rage.
[312:53.07]And raw emotion.
[312:55.25]And total anger and suffering and love and respect.
[312:59.39]It's just a... It's a... Boom!
[313:00.95]You know what I mean?
[313:01.41]Like, if something crazy is happening, the Jerma's son is appropriate.
[313:05.29]Blue Man is the best shit character ever, right?
[313:08.52]It's the best shit character that's ever been put on this channel.
[313:11.90]So he has to be here.
[313:13.28]jermaEgg is delusion.
[313:17.44]Oddity.
[313:17.96]Sadness.
[313:20.30]It's uncertainty.
[313:24.00]Jerma Jupiter represents strength, power, significance.
[313:28.74]jermaRat, from one of my favorite things.
[313:32.69]Rats, the rat movies, it has significance, it has relevancy.
[313:36.49]jermaSaturn, nurturing, emotional.
[313:43.07]Life, death, both.
[313:46.12]jermaSlug represents...
[313:48.92]My idiocy.
[313:50.30]Part of me that has trouble with things.
[313:52.56]My attention problems.
[313:54.02]Detention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[313:56.74]Sleepiness.
[313:58.07]The asteroid.
[313:58.81]Germic comet.
[313:59.87]Represents collision.
[314:02.89]Pure and total.
[314:04.69]Unadulterated power.
[314:07.77]Smashing into things.
[314:09.29]Going as fast as you can.
[314:10.48]Both feet on the ground running.
[314:12.08]Germic fear.
[314:13.00]Anxiety.
[314:14.64]Scared.
[314:16.18]Unsure.
[314:16.98]Uncertain.
[314:17.90]jermaMars.
[314:19.22]Times two, what I just said.
[314:21.33]jermaPluto.
[314:24.39]Sadness.
[314:28.89]Just emotionless.
[314:32.01]Fear.
[314:32.97]Doubt.
[314:34.01]jermaEarth.
[314:35.27]Childlike fun.
[314:38.69]Interested.
[314:43.27]Curious, one would say.
[314:46.22]Bald.
[314:49.36]BLD.
[314:50.02]Bald coin.
[314:51.02]Currency.
[314:51.72]Money.
[314:53.72]Me.
[314:55.20]jermaMustard.
[314:59.40]Insanity.
[315:02.06]Following.
[315:05.18]Internet problems.
[315:06.82]Issues.
[315:10.22]Explosive personality.
[315:13.41]There it is!
[315:18.33]Awkward.
[315:19.37]Weird.
[315:21.11]jermaSnort.
[315:25.43]What is that?
[315:26.25]Huh?
[315:26.95]What does snort, what does that mean?
[315:28.29]What does that convey?
[315:30.59]Bad joke?
[315:33.01]Not funny?
[315:35.86]Annoying?
[315:37.28]That does not serve, has no emotion behind it.
[315:42.66]What, every time I do a shitty bad joke, you're gonna do germish snort?
[315:45.58]That's how it works?
[315:49.91]That's why you want it, because when I do like a bad joke that's not funny, it's gonna be germish snorts the whole time.
[315:58.87]Actually, that's not a bad idea.
[316:00.09]It's germish snort!
[316:02.59]Ridiculous.
[316:05.58]Unnerving.
[316:07.98]Question mark.
[316:08.76]Confusion.
[316:09.66]How?
[316:10.24]Why?
[316:12.20]I'm doing it.
[316:15.59]Dermot, expensive.
[316:18.49]Paying.
[316:20.11]Me.
[316:20.63]Money.
[316:22.01]Lots of it.
[316:24.41]For no reason.
[316:25.50]$25.
[316:26.56]Cash.
[316:26.66]Spending.
[316:32.87]Happiness.
[316:34.43]Just kidding.
[316:35.55]Extortion.
[316:38.72]He talked himself into it.
[316:40.58]I kind of did.
[316:42.00]Yeah, you'll see that like tomorrow, whatever.
[316:46.88]Anyways.
[316:47.24]I don't even know where we were.
[316:50.18]Where are we?
[316:50.68]I still have four hours of bits to do.
[316:56.19]Okay, let's speed it up a little bit.
[317:00.55]Where are we?
[317:00.97]Down here.
[317:06.86]Okay, right here.
[317:08.10]FlubbaGut, thanks for the $1.
[317:09.45]Someone told me you were moving to Pluto.
[317:10.93]Said something about more reliable broadband.
[317:12.97]I wish.
[317:13.97]Thank you, Flubba.
[317:14.57]Thank you, CyberRisket, for the $1.
[317:17.11]Hey, Jeremiah stole these bits from the Twitch Mafia.
[317:18.81]Don't tell anybody.
[317:20.11]Just did.
[317:20.77]Sorry that I just blew up your spot.
[317:21.99]FlubbaGut again, thanks for the $1.
[317:23.29]Love you, by the way.
[317:23.91]You too, man.
[317:24.75]Thank you.
[317:27.91]God, I hate it.
[317:28.59]I do too.
[317:30.24]That's the new worst emote.
[317:34.37]It's just glaring.
[317:36.09]It's bad to look at.
[317:37.25]It's bright and yellow.
[317:38.69]It's gonna ruin every chat that I... No, that's gonna go away soon.
[317:43.20]Can't wait to do a fucking Jerma wrestling event where jermaMustard has zero stats and is the one to die.
[317:51.98]Jerma, you're a fucking sellout.
[317:57.86]Oh no, that one sucks.
[318:06.33]Shit even though it's a back on the venue.
[318:08.35]You know what it looks like I could see how it could make sense It kind of looks like a fire breath Yeah, you could have somebody like with their mouth I got but do a PogChamp and didn't do that and it's gonna look like PogChamp is breathing fire Let's see
[318:40.77]Fucking didn't even do it right you guys see that looks cool That's Jerm of fire that's fire breathing dragon Yeah, you could use that as like as raw double time double emotes super PogChamp
[319:05.40]Streamer can't even use Twitch chat.
[319:07.50]I- I- I know.
[319:08.62]I- I- I always f- Is it- The first one's capital, the next one's capital, it's- it's capital letter.
[319:13.37]This should remove the capital letter bullshit.
[319:15.47]Right?
[319:16.85]Why does it have to be, like, un- lowercase than one capital letter?
[319:20.15]No, fucking just let me write the whole damn thing out, like this.
[319:24.84]You know?
[319:25.22]Like, why can't that just be jermaEarth?
[319:26.74]Why does it have to be, like, Jerma, and then a capital E?
[319:32.52]What a bad website.
[319:35.62]Thanks, though.
[319:36.14]Thank you, too.
[319:38.70]Winsor.
[319:39.86]Winsorand.
[319:40.58]Thanks for the $1.00.
[319:40.94]What?
[319:41.04]That's what they said.
[319:44.07]Procef.
[319:44.51]Prostar.
[319:44.95]Thanks for the $1.00.
[319:45.63]This game is just the movies from an actor's point of view.
[319:51.13]Thank you, SciNTF2, for the $1.00.
[319:54.41]RivaTuner is a great way to limit a game's frame rate.
[319:58.97]Thank you.
[320:01.14]Did he?
[320:01.39]Well, what's with the capital letters?
[320:11.09]I'd like for you to put a thing into Twitch.
[320:13.89]Staff.
[320:15.06]And all it says is, you know, by the way, Top1000Streamer has this feedback for us.
[320:20.08]Top1000Streamer has a thing to tell me.
[320:23.46]It says, what's with the capital letters?
[320:26.84]Dot, dot, dot.
[320:27.74]Question mark.
[320:28.88]And then I'm going to do, like, jermaEarth and fuck it up and do it wrong.
[320:33.71]And then he could see it.
[320:35.07]And then finally, get some changes around here.
[320:42.09]Anyways, Riva Tuner is a good thing, but I'm not sure we're going to be able to use it, because everyone doesn't want me to use it.
[320:48.65]Thank you, SovietWinner, for the $5.30.
[320:50.91]No message.
[320:51.45]Thank you, though.
[320:53.37]Rolarian, or Rolarian, thanks for the $5.00.
[320:56.53]They say, Vihoyo, Vohayo100.
[320:59.74]And then they say, HiDaddy.
[321:03.46]FenwayChaos, thanks for the $5.00.
[321:05.12]How are you this bad?
[321:06.28]This bad at what?
[321:10.31]This game, I told you, aiming in this game was having a Ouija board.
[321:15.05]And five people are using it, and one person's pretending to be the fucking ghost.
[321:19.48]It was fighting against me the whole night.
[321:27.24]Voyeuristic Vol, thanks for the ten dollars.
[321:31.90]Only found you recently, and I'm sorry, I have missed out on so much of the journey.
[321:35.74]You truly are a Goldman.
[321:38.75]Thank you, Voyeuristic Vol.
[321:41.44]Thank you for the $10.
[321:43.62]Appreciate it, man.
[321:44.86]Welcome.
[321:46.65]Hope you enjoy yourself.
[321:47.43]Hope you enjoy the streams.
[321:49.59]We're a very welcoming, loving community here.
[321:55.25]Welcome to the team.
[321:56.89]Welcome to the... I don't know.
[321:58.61]I don't know what to say.
[322:00.02]I don't have a thing that I call everybody.
[322:02.84]Like, welcome to the jokesters, man.
[322:06.26]But thanks, dude.
[322:06.96]Thank you also to SuperSeal for the 25 cents.
[322:08.72]Privileged streamer complains that his FPS is too high.
[322:12.05]Kappa.
[322:14.59]Kuma the Robot, thanks for the 29 bits.
[322:17.09]No message.
[322:17.59]Thank you, Roger Cheeto, for the 25 cents.
[322:19.37]Dermot, this game is locked to 30 FPS.
[322:22.37]The faster speed and all the glitches are unrelated to the FPS.
[322:25.89]You have to download a mod to fix it.
[322:27.33]It's on the PC Gaming Wiki page.
[322:31.93]Again, thank you for the tip.
[322:33.52]The audience has decided by a 75% margin that we're not going to do that.
[322:42.16]Joe Zillow, thanks for the $6.
[322:44.02]No message.
[322:44.44]Thank you, Joe.
[322:45.68]Dr. Clay 999, thanks for the $1 and the tax policy of Herman Cain.
[322:53.19]There's so much chaos and unrealistic quick animations, I'm starting to think that tactical intervention was this game's spiritual successor.
[323:02.75]That game is such a... I love that game.
[323:06.19]I wish they just only made those.
[323:07.89]I wish Tactical Intervention was the only game that anyone ever made.
[323:14.57]And that's the only game that ever came out.
[323:16.00]Just Tactical Intervention with a number next to it.
[323:18.86]And they just kept making more and more.
[323:21.70]No other video games are allowed to release.
[323:25.56]Do we have to pay for Jerma expensive monthly?
[323:27.78]Yes, that's why it's not worth doing.
[323:29.29]Do not do it.
[323:31.97]Only like the weird rich psychopaths do the $25 sub.
[323:35.99]You know what I mean?
[323:38.45]Like, $25 a month to have that awful emote.
[323:43.10]Like, if your taxes this year were like over $100,000, then like, okay, then maybe you could do that and I wouldn't be like, I wouldn't feel bad about it.
[323:52.34]You know what I'm saying?
[323:52.96]Like, you don't have to buy that.
[323:57.15]It's only there for, just for fun.
[324:05.48]I'm so glad.
[324:06.18]That fucking PogChamp fire breathing.
[324:10.88]It's right in the perfect angle too.
[324:12.94]It's like PogChamp ate a really spicy sandwich or something.
[324:16.94]I would bit into it like some Tabasco.
[324:23.72]Anyways, thank you TheCD1234 for the five bucks.
[324:27.40]I was told this was Spider-Man on VHS.
[324:31.50]When does the new Spider-Man game come out?
[324:36.99]I don't even know.
[324:38.16]Soon, right?
[324:38.70]Like this year.
[324:41.94]Jerma hates the poor?
[324:43.22]That's not true!
[324:44.16]I just put on Jerma.
[324:45.14]This was Jerma cheap.
[324:46.50]This was a trash emote that I just uploaded for the default subscriber.
[324:53.33]Okay, when you do Jerma expensive and jermaMustard, it looks like a flaming fart.
[324:57.15]I'm not gonna lie.
[324:58.07]It looks like one of those jokey flaming penis fart things that people do when they put their arms in the air.
[325:05.43]You know what I'm trying to say.
[325:07.54]It looks like they're peeing out like fire.
[325:15.68]It looks like you're fucking lighting a fire up and shooting it right into somebody's face.
[325:24.36]Let them eat trash?
[325:25.92]What are you talking about?
[325:27.02]Stop quoting fake quotes!
[325:35.67]Let's keep going.
[325:36.55]Home Freakin' Run says, no soup for you.

[326:49.39]Appreciate it.

[327:02.12]The CD, thanks for the one dollar.
[327:03.56]This game is like on big bad play.
[327:08.00]This game is like on big bad play.
[327:09.82]I'm not sure what that means, but... Please add a jermaSnort emote.
[327:14.32]This is the clip to me snorting.
[327:16.92]I always get baited into clicking this, so of course we're going to click it at least once.
[327:24.98]Have to do it one every time there's a stream and have to have to click it Somebody paid one dollar for me to click that so I'm gonna do it Somebody has like a re with the fire Uh

[327:56.87]I'm excited to announce that I've been nominated to help perform in the Toontown Fun Fest this year.
[328:02.33]That's a lie, Toontown.
[328:03.49]It was closed.
[328:04.99]I've been editing a musical track from SpongeBob the Musical as I'll be singing along with it.
[328:08.95]It's a six-minute number, and I gotta play six of the main SpongeBob characters.
[328:13.49]only problem is that I got a bad case of pneumonia I hope my voice will be fixed in time for the act liz wasn't much help you know any remedies for fixing one's throat um gargle salt water not too much just get a regular glass of water
[328:32.47]Dyson, maybe like two or three dashes of salt, swish it around.
[328:37.29]Warm water, gargle, spit, rinse, repeat.
[328:41.54]And lozenges, plenty of them.
[328:45.84]But thank you, Garfield.
[328:46.78]Kato, Stardust, thanks for the one dollar, brutalize vegans.
[328:52.38]Well, they were vandalizing vegans, weren't they, huh, in the game?
[328:56.08]So we had to get them under control.
[328:59.00]I'll work on it.
[328:59.62]I'll try.
[328:59.82]Just for you.
[329:00.24]The next stream is gonna have no swear words for at least the first five minutes.
[329:02.84]I promise.
[329:21.33]Hey, Luckybone, thanks for the $1.
[329:22.89]No message.
[329:23.49]Just a dollar.
[329:24.63]Thank you, dude.
[329:25.85]Cyberrisket, thanks for the $1.
[329:27.03]Jeremiah, I've been running from the Twitch cops for days now.
[329:29.29]They want their bits back.
[329:30.27]I'm not sure how much time I have left until they find me, but I'm entrusting the goods to you.
[329:37.61]For $1.
[329:40.37]You, like, robbed a high schooler of his lunch money.
[329:44.70]Come on, man.
[329:45.20]That's low.
[329:47.71]Bro, luck thanks to the $1.
[329:48.73]Do you have to drive the wrong way down the street every single time?
[329:51.97]I told you.
[329:52.71]Go back and figure it out.
[329:54.45]Somebody.
[329:55.97]I'd like somebody to do it.
[329:58.18]Remember, if they're watching the VOD, fuck.
[330:00.40]I can't go back and tell them.
[330:02.44]I wish I could put a... You know what I wish you could do?
[330:05.04]Okay, hey.
[330:05.86]Spencer!
[330:07.80]Spencer!
[330:08.66]Spencer, listen to me!
[330:09.90]I wish there was a thing you could do where I could... Remember, write this down.
[330:15.59]Top 1,000 streamer here.
[330:18.84]Write this down.
[330:20.34]Have a way that I can maybe write shit on the VODs.
[330:22.98]You know what I'm saying?
[330:24.12]Like little annotations.
[330:25.78]So what if I said, hey, skip to here to see like a crazy event.
[330:29.00]Or hey man, sorry, internet cuts out around like two hours.
[330:31.68]You might want to skip that part.
[330:32.86]Or hey, let me get annotations.
[330:37.03]So I can add, you know, a few things.
[330:41.87]Write shit on the VODs maybe.
[330:46.81]This isn't YouTube, but it's a VOD, it's a video on demand.
[330:52.47]VODs were only put on YouTube videos for you to accidentally fucking click on them and for them to annoyingly advertise another video on your screen for 30 seconds.
[331:04.56]Remember the old Machinima videos?
[331:06.96]I think, actually, I think there still are advertisements for their zombie TV show.
[331:12.09]And it says, like, it pops up, eat this!
[331:14.59]And you can click it and you can go to their skit that they made.
[331:17.95]It's still on some of those videos.
[331:22.76]What a disaster.
[331:27.04]No, you're right.
[331:27.44]I'll let the VOD product manager know it's not bad.
[331:30.72]Even if it was a little, like, like...
[331:32.46]Little pops?
[331:33.22]You can call them pops.
[331:34.52]P-O-P-Ps.
[331:35.88]No, P-O-P's.
[331:36.58]Pops.
[331:39.40]If somebody wanted to have them in different places, a streamer wanted you to know something, maybe a little bit of inside information, they could... Oh, wait, there's a pop right there.
[331:46.59]I can click it.
[331:47.31]And you can get bits.
[331:48.69]It's a way to farm bits, maybe.
[331:50.09]You get some bits for doing it, like interacting.
[331:54.82]Yep, you ruined it.
[332:00.30]And I get bits when they click it?
[332:06.54]Reese's Pops.
[332:10.32]He's lost it.
[332:11.00]No, I'm just fucking around.
[332:12.82]I'm just fucking getting.
[332:16.85]Gotta have my pops.
[332:18.25]That's right.
[332:18.93]No grown-ups allowed.
[332:21.59]Ow.
[332:22.57]Ow!
[332:24.35]God damn it.
[332:24.94]I just like hurt myself.
[332:27.50]I'm playing with a broken part of a CD and I just like fucked up my hand.
[332:34.88]What CD is this?
[332:35.64]It's a broken CD that's sitting on the table here.
[332:37.62]And I just picked it up and I was moving it around and I chipped a piece off.
[332:47.41]It's not worth it if the VOD gets deleted after two months.
[332:49.59]Yeah, but it could be like a fun little thing.
[332:50.97]Who remembers a VH1 pop-up video?
[332:54.53]That's what it is.
[332:55.03]Where they just plastered a bunch of awful annotations all over your favorite music videos of behind-the-scenes info?
[333:01.70]You could do that too.
[333:02.68]It'd be behind the scenes.
[333:06.41]Like, remember when I got, uh, we got hit by the car and it turned into, like, the firework and I blew up?
[333:10.49]I could be- Could be- Check it out, man!
[333:15.70]We all laughed about this afterwards and called it a firework!
[333:18.42]And then, like, that funny laughing face.
[333:22.80]And then it could just go away.
[333:23.62]It goes away in, like, five- Not even five seconds.
[333:25.59]It's a little pop.
[333:30.87]Hey, call the Spritz.
[333:31.61]Thanks for the one dollar.
[333:34.35]You should play the new Donk City theme.
[333:38.40]I don't know what that is.
[333:44.68]Bro.
[333:46.00]Thank you.
[333:47.48]Thank you, bro.
[333:48.02]Look again.
[333:48.38]Look, see what happens.
[333:52.72]Now I have a Twitch clip to link.
[333:54.98]I have somebody link something to me.
[333:58.46]If this is what I think it is, I'm gonna be upset.
[334:05.62]This is the direct route.
[334:09.57]See?
[334:09.83]What is this?
[334:10.17]You're gonna say, don't drive over there!
[334:11.67]That was fucking funny.
[334:23.88]Let's all watch it together.
[334:25.20]That was funny.
[334:27.04]That's funny.
[334:29.96]I wanna watch it again.
[334:31.42]It just so perfectly just pancakes that guy.
[334:35.73]This is the direct...
[334:44.29]that guy turned we just stamped that guy no we didn't we didn't just do that that happened four hours ago okay uh Jack of blades 399 can you say my name of course I will anyways um that let's move on with the bits we're more than halfway done
[335:06.22]Uh, boopity boppity, thanks for the five dollars, or booty party.
[335:09.74]No, boot, boot party.
[335:11.61]Whatever your name is, thanks for five dollars.
[335:14.43]Hey, I'm commenting crimes here.
[335:17.59]Also, visit Coronet for a slice of pizza as you big, as big as your head.
[335:22.87]What is this?
[335:23.53]Why do you... I don't know what that, I don't know anything you just said.
[335:31.42]Not even one single notion.
[335:33.40]I don't know, I have no idea what you just told me to do.
[335:37.37]Thank you, though.
[335:39.23]Thank you, Hint of Hat, for the five dollars.
[335:40.91]No message, thank you.
[335:44.17]Hint of Hat.
[335:45.95]Rogue Fort Zero, thanks for the one dollar.
[335:49.09]Hey Jerma, I come with a game recommendation.
[335:51.39]One Shot.
[335:52.77]It's a story-based adventure puzzle game that focuses on meta humor and acknowledgement of your existence as a person and itself as a game.
[336:00.45]It decimates the fourth and fifth wall, while still somehow making you care.
[336:05.15]It's best played alone in a quiet room, so it's not the best stream game.
[336:09.35]I think you would love it.
[336:11.28]If you played it before, tell me your thoughts.
[336:12.60]Thanks for the years of laughter, and I hope you enjoy One-Shot.
[336:16.74]I've never played it.
[336:18.90]If you don't think it's a good game to stream, I would... I probably would just stream it.
[336:24.49]No, no, I would not stream it.
[336:25.83]I would just do it... Let me go against all of your wishes, first of all.
[336:30.57]I would probably just play it off camera.
[336:34.95]How long is it?
[336:35.39]Is it a long game?
[336:38.15]Nobody say Doki Doki or you are permanently banned.
[336:43.88]If I see one... If I see the words Doki Doki in this chat again, I'm permanently being banned.
[336:54.86]Done.
[336:56.74]Spencer, you know what to do.
[336:59.23]You see, you guys have... What you don't realize is... You're talking to a top 1,000 streamer, okay?
[337:04.98]We got Twitch staff in the chat here.
[337:07.75]He has so much power.
[337:09.61]And he can ban that word from all of Twitch.
[337:13.59]All he has to do is just, like, go to the heads, the suits, and, like, he's gonna walk into the office, and he's gonna be, like, they're all gonna be sweating, like, pulling their shirts, like, like, steam coming out, like, what did he say?
[337:24.98]What did that top 1,000th framer tell us?
[337:27.56]Like, yeah, he wanted us to get rid of the Doki Doki as a word.
[337:31.00]Oh, shit!
[337:32.04]More steam, and, like, I think we have to do it.
[337:35.01]He's one of the top 1,000th.
[337:37.11]I get what I want.
[337:39.28]Yeah, I'm gonna latch on to this for like a fucking couple days, okay?
[337:42.41]Somebody just told that to me, so now we're gonna latch on to it.
[337:44.37]That's what we do around here.
[337:47.71]Thank you, Corgi, for the five, uh, zero cents, fifty cents.
[337:54.03]You're too loose to the case.
[337:56.79]Give me your badge and gun.
[337:58.36]You're too close to the case.
[337:59.66]Give me your badge and gun.
[338:01.08]Sure.
[338:02.64]Hawkeye of mine, thanks for the three dollars, is this Ghetto Borderlands 2?
[338:07.90]No, it is not.
[338:12.24]It is true crime.
[338:13.98]Streets of New York.
[338:16.14]Get it right or pay the price.
[338:19.84]You fucking ass.
[338:22.24]Manboy777, thanks for the 25 cents.
[338:26.42]If Officer Jex was real, I'm sure he'd be sentenced to death.
[338:30.22]Yes, he would.
[338:38.15]One shot is a good game.
[338:41.43]And it's a cute cat.
[338:46.13]If it's got cute cats, I'm gonna have to check it out.
[338:50.45]Uh... Thank you to Shly161.
[338:52.25]Hey, Jerma.
[338:55.10]Notice you've been doing more Vin Diesel impressions recently.
[338:58.16]You ever thinking about streaming Escape from Butcher Bay, the FPS game starring Vin Diesel?
[339:03.42]I think you'll have a lot of fun with that.
[339:04.38]Vin Diesel has been... in a bunch of video games.
[339:10.82]He does the voice acting for all those games that he's in.
[339:13.78]What's it?
[339:15.08]Altered reality?
[339:16.94]Altered... When he's blind.
[339:21.02]He made like six movies where he was a blind guy that beat the shit out of people.
[339:23.88]What is it called?
[339:27.06]Alone in the Dark?
[339:30.38]What are they called?
[339:34.37]Oh my god, this is going to kill me.
[339:35.33]What is it?
[339:38.50]The Chronicles of Riddick.
[339:40.10]That's what it is.
[339:42.66]What did I say?
[339:43.22]I don't know.
[339:46.00]Whatever it was.
[339:46.50]Chronicles of Riddick.
[339:47.88]He did all the voices for the Riddick games.
[339:53.09]He was Driver.
[339:54.09]He was in that game too.
[339:57.27]All the Fast and the Furious games he was in.
[339:59.31]Right?
[340:01.43]He's been in a lot of random video games.
[340:03.15]But I'll check it out.
[340:03.89]Yeah.
[340:05.71]Thank you NeverTrustAPurple again for your $50 earlier.
[340:08.18]I'm not sure if you're still here.
[340:09.48]If you are, thank you so much, dude.
[340:13.72]Yeah, we did do the vote already.
[340:15.66]We're doing more of the speed.
[340:23.40]Thank you Derailing6969 for the fav dollars.
[340:27.97]Shoutout to my friend, Tyler.
[340:31.48]I'm not going to say last name, because we don't say... I'm not going to say first and last name on stream.
[340:35.46]I'm going to say... Hey, Tyler, shout out to you, Tyler.
[340:38.34]D-Railing wanted to say hi.
[340:42.79]Cyberrisket, thanks for the $1.
[340:44.19]I can hear the Twitch police banging at my door, Jerma.
[340:46.35]I don't have much time.
[340:48.25]They'll get in soon.
[340:50.29]That was four hours ago, so I'm assuming you're probably in jail.
[340:54.18]NeverTrustPurple again, thanks for the $5.
[340:56.14]Thank you, Purple.
[340:57.60]I love how everyone is moving at super speed, and this guy is super slow.
[341:02.20]Of the last six months, my biggest regret is not seeing that all the way through.
[341:11.23]That had so much potential to be funny.
[341:14.13]Biggest regret of the last six months on stream is just I shouldn't have touched anything.
[341:19.03]And I did.
[341:19.79]Mistake.
[341:21.01]Thank you, Bill.
[341:22.17]Thank you, Winsorind, for the $1.
[341:23.87]Amazing Matrix impression.
[341:25.13]Thank you.
[341:26.54]The Mightiest of Beards, thanks for the $10.
[341:28.20]I was going to do $5,000, but then you punched the car.
[341:32.56]I would say that's, yeah.
[341:35.72]If you were going to give me 50 bucks and you gave me 10 instead because I've ruined that whole thing.
[341:41.30]Yeah, that's worth it.
[341:42.64]Like a 90% decrease in you paying me.
[341:45.54]I accept it.
[341:46.32]Thanks for the 10 bucks though.
[341:47.26]That's a lot of money.
[341:49.81]Thank you.
[341:51.69]Hey, Niskoi664, thanks for the $1.00.
[341:57.90]Thank you, CyberBiscuit, for the $1.
[341:59.22]The door's just been broken.
[342:00.48]I can hear the Twitch police searching the house.
[342:01.92]There is the last of the stolen bits I'm going to give you.
[342:03.84]Jerma, please stream in on my money.
[342:06.36]Stream on in my memory.
[342:07.56]Also, these bits are still illegal, so they're coming after you next.
[342:10.20]Have fun.
[342:11.92]What you don't understand is... I have... This is not on me.
[342:19.86]This is on you.
[342:23.88]Jerma snorted.
[342:27.11]Top 10,000.
[342:28.33]Top 10,000 streamer.
[342:30.65]Excuse me.
[342:31.39]Top 1,000.
[342:32.01]That's a stretch?
[342:35.61]How?
[342:37.77]Do you see how many emotes?
[342:40.58]That are in this chat right now?
[342:42.92]For every emote that you see right now, that's one more rung on the ladder up on the top 1,000 that I am.
[342:49.26]Talk about how many emotes you have.
[342:51.34]How many emotes are in your chat?
[342:55.20]He's 938.
[342:58.79]Hey, I'm gonna go play Kino later, and I'm gonna do 9, 3, and 7.
[343:02.97]Come on, 9, 38?
[343:10.94]Who's 9, 37?
[343:11.60]That's what I want to know.
[343:15.80]Who's 9, 37?
[343:16.16]Let's take a look.
[343:20.10]Let's look at my social blade.
[343:21.76]I haven't opened up, so... B+, by the way!
[343:27.03]Also, hold on a second.
[343:28.21]Hold on a minute here.
[343:29.81]Everybody just back up.
[343:31.43]Keep in mind, this website keeps track of the last 30 days.
[343:37.21]And as I'm sure a lot of you guys are well aware, I haven't really been streaming too much in the last two or three weeks because of PAX, because of the last week of all the things that were going on.
[343:49.32]So this is skewed data.
[343:51.76]You come back to me in like two or three more weeks when we have a full good schedule.
[343:55.20]And we'll see if that B plus goes to an A. And we'll see if we go to like 500.
[344:00.65]This will go from 938 to like 655.
[344:07.23]And that'll be an A minus.
[344:10.95]It's the last 30 days.
[344:17.98]Egotistical streamer.
[344:20.67]No, don't you understand?
[344:22.25]I'm not an egotistical person.
[344:25.67]I just play one on TV.
[344:32.78]I lost the chat.
[344:33.42]What the hell?
[344:36.60]Why did I lose the chat?
[344:38.22]New computers.
[344:41.84]Get back up there.
[344:42.50]Here we go.
[344:48.11]There we go.
[344:48.59]Thank you to... Savior of the Dreaming Dead.
[344:51.81]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[344:55.66]Just fucking buckaroo bonsai the wall.
[344:58.32]Sure.
[345:01.14]Thank you Manboy777 for the 25 cents.
[345:03.26]jermaEarth.
[345:03.80]Love the new emote.
[345:04.48]It's so cute.
[345:06.34]Back from vacation with his sun hat and sunscreen on his nose.
[345:10.53]He had a good time.
[345:13.34]Bitslave, what are you still doing here?
[345:15.88]I thought you were done.
[345:16.64]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[345:18.62]This is what's keeping me from dying.
[345:20.14]Without my work, this is all I've got.
[345:24.07]I'm afraid to click this clip.
[345:34.11]I'm not clicking Twitch clips anymore.
[345:35.49]Because they're all going to be that.
[345:38.54]Doesn't matter how they're different or how many times they've been clipped.
[345:41.38]So I don't see what it is.
[345:43.85]I'm not going to click a Twitch clip anymore.
[345:45.46]I'll click the maybe, but I'm going to turn the volume off.
[345:56.38]How many times has that clip been watched?
[345:58.32]This one has been watched 128 times.
[346:04.54]That's nothing.
[346:06.38]That's not true, though, because so many people clip the same fucking thing.
[346:14.81]How embarrassing.
[346:19.51]God.
[346:20.87]Anywho.
[346:22.25]Thank you to Robert M4 for the $1.
[346:25.73]Here, buy some berries.
[346:26.86]Thank you.
[346:28.44]Robert M4 again.
[346:30.14]Gave $5 total, actually, to say that.
[346:32.14]Thank you.
[346:34.60]Obsidious D, thanks for the $1.
[346:36.58]Love you, Jerma.
[346:37.18]Love you, too.
[346:37.72]Thank you for sticking around.
[346:40.45]NPC Fury, thanks for the $1.
[346:42.06]It was so wonderful to meet you at PAX East, man.
[346:45.30]Thank you so much for signing those stupid eggs.
[346:48.46]My buddies and I will cherish them forever, or at least until the Sharpie rubs off.
[346:52.38]Any dang way, you're the best.
[346:53.53]Also, this game is very silly.
[346:54.87]Thank you, NPC Fury.
[346:57.95]And by the way, only eggs that I signed at PAX.
[347:02.49]Well, you have to special eggs.
[347:06.21]Hope you had a good time at PAX.
[347:08.53]Hope you and your, uh... You and your crew cherish the eggs.
[347:13.64]Don't eat them, though.
[347:14.22]They're plastic.
[347:15.80]But thank you so much.
[347:16.44]Ow!
[347:17.24]Fuck, stop playing with sharp objects!
[347:20.66]I'm seriously just playing with knives right now.
[347:23.18]Like, what am I doing?
[347:25.45]This is a knife.
[347:27.45]Where's my webcam?
[347:28.01]Is it even plugged in?
[347:28.77]No, never mind.
[347:29.49]I can't show you.
[347:29.97]But I'm literally... This is a knife in my hand.
[347:32.55]It's a CD.
[347:34.25]It's just the side of a CD.
[347:35.51]Listen.
[347:36.36]You hear that?
[347:36.92]That was not a piece of chocolate.
[347:39.06]That was not a delicious Hershey's Square.
[347:40.98]That was, in fact, a CD knife.
[347:47.49]This is a knife.
[347:52.56]Thank you, Hydra725, for the $1.
[347:54.42]Thank you for the stream.
[347:55.28]I played this game a lot when it came out, and it's hilarious to watch you play it.
[347:59.22]I almost spit my beer multiple times tonight.
[348:02.17]Love you, baby, you big cutie patootie.
[348:03.95]Thank you, Hydra.
[348:06.67]Yeah, the true crime games are just kind of little gems.
[348:13.32]They're little GTA halves-y GTAs.
[348:18.73]There's tons of crazy shit in them.
[348:20.15]They're great.
[348:21.69]I'm not sure why anyone hasn't made one of these games where you can kind of arrest people and frisk people and investigate stuff.
[348:29.99]And there's crimes all being committed.
[348:31.61]I would love a GTA.
[348:35.69]Honestly, just pipe dream here.
[348:37.11]And this might sound odd, but GTA 6?
[348:41.53]How incredible would it be if you were one of the police officers and you got to do that shit?
[348:48.38]I wish they would make a current gen GTA where you did this shit as a cop in Grand Theft Auto.
[348:54.37]In the Grand Theft Auto universe.
[348:55.81]Make it happen.
[348:56.31]I don't know why they wouldn't.
[349:03.13]You played a GTA 4 mod?
[349:04.25]Yeah.
[349:05.21]The LCPDFR, whatever it was.
[349:08.03]But that was super sloppy and broken and strange.
[349:11.29]I'm talking a current gen full story about how you're like a Los Santos police officer or something.
[349:21.87]It'd be fun to go around and just be a cop.
[349:24.63]Because it is fun to do this in this game.
[349:26.65]Just kind of go around and... Oh, wait, you're under arrest!
[349:30.80]Just wish there was a current-gen version of it.
[349:35.06]Yeah, that was a mod for GTA 4.
[349:39.96]Anyways, let me make sure I didn't miss anybody here.
[349:43.16]Thank you for all luck again for the $1.
[349:44.92]Driving backwards on the wrong side of the road is still driving wrong.
[349:49.24]Is it, though?
[349:51.04]Is it, though?
[349:53.13]Think about that.
[349:55.87]Wincerin, thanks for the $1.
[349:56.91]Thanks for the stream.
[349:57.59]Good for procrastination.
[349:59.07]I'm glad I could help you procrastinate.
[350:00.88]I hope you do get what you need to do to get done, you know?
[350:02.96]Get it done.
[350:04.76]Combine, thanks for the $1.
[350:05.88]Will you ever play GTA 4 or 5 story on stream?
[350:11.14]No.
[350:12.47]I'll tell you one specific reason for GTA 5, because I bought the game three times, and I played through it three times.
[350:18.17]I played the single player when it first came out on PlayStation 3, and then when they did the revamp with first-person mode, I did the whole thing again pretty much on PS4, and then again when it came out on PC, because they added the replay editor, and I fucked around in that a lot.
[350:37.34]I made a video on GTA V PC.
[350:40.58]I've made like... All of my GTA V videos were over three generations of console and PC.
[350:48.78]But I've played through them too many times.
[350:50.33]They're fantastic, wonderful video games.
[350:52.15]But I wouldn't do them on stream.
[350:54.99]I've done them too many times.
[350:55.97]Same reason why I would never do Bloodborne.
[350:57.31]Because I beat Bloodborne like four times.
[351:00.94]There's no genuine wonder anymore.
[351:05.06]It's kind of just going through the motions at that point.
[351:11.14]Now, that's next on the list.
[351:12.02]Once I fill out a bunch of these emotes, subbed sounds and subbed noises, those are getting a rehaul.
[351:15.04]Those are getting a rehaul.
[351:30.18]Eefs!
[351:30.62]Hey, Eefs!
[351:31.08]What's going on, man?
[351:31.68]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[351:32.52]Hope everything's alright with you, Jeremy.
[351:34.34]Also, I'd just like to ask you if you remember me calling your name from the upstairs when you walked into PAX.
[351:38.89]All I remember you saying was, like, how the fuck did you get up there?
[351:41.43]I do remember that.
[351:42.11]Well, here's an interesting story.
[351:43.25]So, guys, listen.
[351:43.91]I'll tell you a PAX story.
[351:45.87]Not really a story as much as it is something weird and funny.
[351:49.83]So, I went to PAX on Thursday.
[351:53.15]And I told... On Twitter, I made a tweet saying, Hey, I'm gonna be in the PAX lobby...
[351:59.08]Around this time, I think it was like 5 or something, 5 or 6 o'clock is when I was gonna be there.
[352:03.91]I'll let you know, I'll tweet again, and we'll talk about exactly where I'm standing, blah blah blah.
[352:08.63]So I get my coffee, which was a shitty little espresso.
[352:12.43]It was a double espresso in a cup that you can't drink out of.
[352:15.15]So I had to, you had to pop the top off of the espresso to drink out of this fucking thing.
[352:19.51]But that was annoying.
[352:21.07]And then, so I'm trying to drink the coffee, I can't do it.
[352:24.37]I walk in the front doors of PAX.
[352:27.95]This huge lobby.
[352:30.17]I've been in, I've walked in this door seven or eight, six or seven times, however long PAX East has been going on.
[352:35.58]And I just hear, There was ten people upstairs, six people over to the left, like four people on the right, they all said my name.
[352:46.54]It was, I swear to God, I thought it was a surprise birthday party.
[352:50.34]That's what it felt like.
[352:52.35]It was just like, everybody just was like, And I was like, holy shit, what's happening?
[352:57.97]Yeah, and it was eefs.
[352:58.79]It was eefs and a bunch of fucking buddies.
[353:03.47]Like, people were stopping and looking at me.
[353:05.34]I had this, like, shitty coffee in my hands.
[353:06.94]I was sleepless.
[353:08.30]And I'm just sitting there going, like, do I need to do something to something?
[353:11.56]Just, what happened?
[353:15.37]I really thought the lights were going to turn off as I walked in.
[353:17.47]And, like, a fucking cake was going to roll up.
[353:21.47]But no, I appreciate it.
[353:22.35]It's, um... It was a very, very humbling experience.
[353:26.91]I never would expect somebody to be that excited when I came into a lobby, so... Thank you for that.
[353:34.97]That felt, um... That felt really great.
[353:38.05]I, like, can't... Like I said, I... Every day I imagine... Like, how... How the fuck did this happen?
[353:47.16]You know what I mean?
[353:47.72]Like, sometimes I think about it.
[353:48.92]It's just so... Really?
[353:49.96]Really?
[353:51.64]I'm grateful every day.
[353:54.26]Thank you guys.
[353:57.50]Narcissistic streamer thinks the world revolves around him.
[354:02.37]You've been on the end stream screen for like an hour.
[354:04.71]Yeah, well, we're just hanging out.
[354:07.61]We're just chilling.
[354:08.69]Doing the bits, talking.
[354:10.93]Gives us an opportunity just to hang out.
[354:15.73]Thank you, MetalSand, for the 50 cents.
[354:17.81]Oh shit, what the fuck, oh shit, what the fuck, oh shit, what the fuck, oh shit.
[354:20.39]Oh, he's doing the thing that pedestrians do.
[354:23.53]BroLuck, thanks for the one dollar.
[354:24.79]You went on a ram-ray with the bus.
[354:27.04]Well, we've got this one already, but thank you, BroLuck.
[354:30.02]BroLuck again says, good cop.
[354:31.86]It's not possible to be a good cop in this game.
[354:34.04]You accidentally will bring your points down every time you go anywhere.
[354:38.76]Uh... Dare... Dairy... Dareeth... Payer...
[354:45.12]Dairy the Pear.
[354:46.98]Thank you, Dairy.
[354:47.94]Or Dare the Pear for the $5.
[354:49.58]Appreciate it, dude.
[354:51.33]Bro luck again, thanks for the $1.
[354:52.77]Bro luck for $2 here, actually.
[354:54.17]No times have you driven correctly the whole stream.
[354:56.19]Is that true?
[355:01.25]Somebody confirmed that.
[355:03.70]And then he said, I like how you can take down 50 people in a single room, but one guy flying around on a carnival ride in an opera theater, 10 minutes to take a shot.
[355:13.64]It's the way the game works.
[355:16.53]Almost done here.
[355:17.11]Thank you, Fred Flintstone for the $1.
[355:18.43]jermaPluto is my favorite emote on Twitch.
[355:20.95]I'll give you Jerma Balds to not delete it.
[355:23.46]I'll be very jermaPluto.
[355:26.12]No, I just added jermaPluto.
[355:27.72]Why would I delete it?
[355:29.86]I'm not going to delete Pluto.
[355:31.52]It just got here.
[355:36.06]Darren?
[355:36.90]Yeah, no, it's Dare.
[355:38.51]Dare.
[355:40.51]Brolic, again, thanks for the $1.
[355:41.77]Please don't slow the game down.
[355:42.95]If anything, speed it up.
[355:45.65]I don't think I can speed it up.
[355:46.85]And then we got Spencer.
[355:49.19]I'm not sure if Spencer is still here, but Spencer gave $5.
[355:52.05]Twitch staff gave me $5 here.
[355:55.60]Jeremiah, I love you, but your taste in games is goddamn atrocious.
[355:59.58]What?
[355:59.78]What are you talking about?
[356:02.24]This game is great.
[356:04.88]Hold on.
[356:06.06]Spencer, hold on a minute.
[356:08.58]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[356:10.17]How could you say such a thing?
[356:11.31]Look at the last 60 days for me on Twitch.
[356:13.23]Let's look at the games I've been playing.
[356:15.21]Let's figure this out.
[356:16.89]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[356:19.13]Okay, we got Sub Rosa.
[356:20.55]Okay, yeah.
[356:22.08]True Crime New York.
[356:23.38]Great fucking game.
[356:25.88]Before that, we had a telephone stream, so there's no game there.
[356:31.55]Before that, we had Monster Rancher 4.
[356:35.80]That was awful.
[356:36.58]Okay, so we got two out of three here.
[356:41.36]Monster Rancher 3 was terrible, so yes, I agree.
[356:46.75]And then Choose Your Own Adventure book rating.
[356:48.47]That was not actually even a game.
[356:51.23]So we're two for two.
[356:52.19]We're two for one here.
[356:52.91]And then The Family Dinner was the day before that.
[356:55.81]Well, two days before that.
[356:56.77]Not a video game.
[356:58.62]Far Cry 5.
[357:00.88]Was a bad game.
[357:02.14]Fuck.
[357:03.62]No, Far Cry 5 was... Far Cry 5 was fun.
[357:07.74]It was.
[357:08.28]The game's not good.
[357:09.86]But it was a blast.
[357:12.57]Fuck.
[357:13.49]You might be right.
[357:13.97]No, uh, hold on a minute.
[357:14.99]A Way Out.
[357:15.41]A Way Out was very, very fun.
[357:18.91]That was a great game.
[357:22.35]So, I'm sorry, man.
[357:23.17]You got, like, two to three here.
[357:26.25]Monster Rancher...
[357:28.45]Monster Rancher 2, excuse me, one of the best games ever.
[357:31.01]Unless you don't like, um, Monster Rancher, which, how could the hell could you not like Monster Rancher?
[357:41.50]Son of mine.
[357:46.80]How do I get on this, how do I get this podcast on iTunes?
[357:51.86]Um, you don't, we're just hanging out.
[357:54.18]We're just hanging out, man.
[357:59.05]I do... I... Listen, Etalyx.
[358:01.49]I do a stream.
[358:03.46]We do a stream.
[358:04.96]And then we hang the fuck out.
[358:07.30]We just sit here and chill.
[358:09.30]For whoever wants to stay here and we relax and we just talk about things and we do the bits.
[358:15.51]This is... Sometimes this lasts more than a couple hours.
[358:21.11]You get your stream and then you get your after stream.
[358:23.57]This is the after show.
[358:24.69]You know, like, um...
[358:26.59]The Walking Dead comes out.
[358:29.23]You watch The Walking Dead.
[358:30.41]Terrible show.
[358:31.63]Awful fucking trash can of a show.
[358:33.97]But then, when you're done being angry at all the awful story decisions they've made, you get to get your confirmation bias lit up like a Christmas tree when The Talking Dead comes on afterwards.
[358:45.21]And you watch for about an hour of them, you know, talk about what happened and how the stream is going and... You get a backstage pass...
[358:57.10]Alright, full disclosure, I have only seen like seven episodes of The Walking Dead.
[359:06.79]You wouldn't have jermaMustard if it wasn't for the after show.
[359:09.25]That is absolutely correct.
[359:15.01]That emote would have been gone forever.
[359:17.75]It never would have been put through.
[359:18.83]So there you go.
[359:23.86]Anyways, uh, thank you the Pat Marcins for the one dollar.
[359:26.98]You'll be hearing from my lawyer about getting my sides back from orbit.
[359:31.58]Hope you get them back.
[359:34.14]There was some really, really fun shit in this game.
[359:37.93]I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.
[359:40.19]It's been at least a couple months since I've laughed as hard as when we turned into the fucking firework.
[359:44.81]That was the fucking hardest I've laughed in a while.
[359:48.66]Just internalizing how hard I'm laughing.
[359:53.79]Uh, but thank you to... Where are we here?
[359:59.32]Thank you, Bitslay, for the 25 cents.
[360:00.68]Don't listen to that dweeb, my lord.
[360:02.10]This game is good.
[360:03.32]Also, give me my job back.
[360:05.66]Spencer's not a dweeb.
[360:07.06]Don't call him that.
[360:07.92]Don't listen to Spencer, says Broluck.
[360:09.42]Your tastes are great.
[360:10.38]Thanks for the $1.
[360:11.08]Appreciate it.
[360:13.24]Overlord Goose, thanks for the $1.
[360:15.48]Broluck, thanks for the $1.
[360:16.59]There are slow motion scenes in the game which you aren't noticing because the game is sped up.
[360:21.76]That's... I love it.
[360:22.80]That's fantastic.
[360:23.52]Thank you, MetalSand, for the 25 cents.
[360:25.32]Marcus Reed, main character of New York City, has ascended to the heavens.
[360:32.64]He must become a planet.
[360:34.59]He must.
[360:37.27]Main character of New York City.
[360:40.89]Thank you, SwiftyBagel, for the $1.
[360:42.39]Great stream, as always.
[360:43.13]Have a good one.
[360:43.55]Thank you.
[360:43.99]Thanks for sticking around.
[360:46.87]AncientSasquatch, that's a good name.
[360:49.47]Hey, Jerma, I just bought Bloodborne, and since it's your favorite game, would you have any pointers for someone who's never played a FromSoftware game before?
[360:56.15]Thank you, AncientSasquatch.
[360:58.11]Good fucking name.
[360:59.17]What a good question, too.
[361:01.06]Perfect question.
[361:04.14]I would say that pointers, if you've never played a FromSoftware game, you will probably hate everything you're doing.
[361:17.43]It gets to a point where you try to wonder why you even bought it in the first place.
[361:22.35]Best pointer I can possibly tell you for a game like Bloodborne or Dark Souls or any of them is go slow.
[361:31.24]Go super fucking slow.
[361:34.08]It's not a game where you want to run around and hack and slash and freak out and try.
[361:39.18]You really just need to take it one enemy at a time.
[361:42.02]And I mean that very literally.
[361:44.50]One enemy at a time.
[361:46.54]And try to find a strategy.
[361:48.00]Make sure you look at the exits.
[361:49.92]Always look around whenever you pull somebody, whenever you fight somebody.
[361:53.26]Make sure that you have an exit strategy in case something goes wrong.
[361:56.62]Because there's a lot of cases in those games where they just deliberately try to fuck you.
[362:02.01]by putting a cliff next to you, or having a narrow corridor to have to go through, or a bridge.
[362:08.83]It really is just... try to... try to take it as slow as you can, and each enemy is essentially its own boss.
[362:21.02]Or another thing is like what somebody's saying, Bilbo is saying, play with a friend.
[362:26.05]That's not frowned upon.
[362:28.39]It really isn't.
[362:29.17]The game is hard.
[362:29.97]It's grueling.
[362:32.03]And if it's not something that you think you can do by yourself, summon somebody and you can do most of the game together.
[362:42.52]Use the cleaver.
[362:44.30]No, Bloodborne is, um... Oh, by the way, don't use the cane.
[362:48.34]If you have the cane, restart the game.
[362:51.40]No, don't restart the game because you can get it in, like, not even an hour.
[362:54.76]The best starter weapon, in my opinion, really is the heavy axe.
[362:58.84]If you picked the cane because you thought it was cool looking... Oh, wow, this is great.
[363:02.09]I'm having a tough time, though.
[363:03.07]I can't do anything.
[363:03.75]I can't hurt anybody.
[363:05.33]Don't use the cane.
[363:06.93]Use the heavy axe if it's the first time you've ever played.
[363:11.73]The cane is not the best for a new player...
[363:16.45]For a brand new player, the cane is not what you want to play with.
[363:24.07]You started with the cane and it was a blast?
[363:25.51]No, the cane is fun, but it's a very, very... It's hard to kill things with the cane if you don't really understand the game.
[363:33.42]Sawcleaver is god tier?
[363:34.62]Sawcleaver is god tier, but you need to be good.
[363:38.22]Axe?
[363:38.76]There's a lot of leeway with the axe.
[363:42.76]The charged R2 with the axe can help you out in so many situations.
[363:47.81]If you get surrounded or if you're having trouble, the axe is a good beginner weapon.
[363:51.59]It just is.
[363:52.03]It's your first FromSoftware game?
[363:57.81]Yeah, that's why.
[364:00.38]Takes a certain kind of player to you.
[364:02.64]Not really even player, it just takes a certain mindset.
[364:08.38]I didn't really like the other two weapons.
[364:09.82]I restarted again recently and tried the axe and it's a lot of fun.
[364:12.44]Yeah, it has a lot of reach.
[364:14.84]It's very, very easy to use.
[364:18.44]Especially when you put it in the two hands.
[364:20.44]And you just swing it around wildly.
[364:23.75]Yeah, read all the item descriptions too.
[364:26.72]There's a lot of weird, random information.
[364:30.64]All the FromSoftware games do not tell you a goddamn thing.
[364:34.90]Nothing.
[364:35.94]You have to figure everything out on your own.
[364:38.12]No one's going to tell you where to go.
[364:40.30]I mean, they will, just by you exploring and seeing the next couple of paths, but it's not a game that tells you anything.
[364:48.85]This shit that people still don't know about Dark Souls.
[364:51.05]Didn't somebody just figure out...
[364:54.32]wasn't something new just found out about Dark Souls recently like not even a year ago they found some like giant kingdom didn't they was that Dark Souls 3. oh there's this whole another map that they didn't use like the kingdom of giants I could talk about Bloodborne for hours I could it's one of my favorite games ever made they just found a boss
[365:19.39]Yeah, there was a new in-development area that somebody came across somehow.
[365:23.33]I don't know how.
[365:24.55]I don't think it was in the game.
[365:25.73]I think they pulled the files out and looked.
[365:29.13]So it's very interesting stuff.
[365:30.45]There's a ton to read about.
[365:34.04]Bloodborne unused assets.
[365:36.90]Or it was Demon's Souls.
[365:37.78]Interesting.
[365:39.40]But yeah, hopefully you got any information from that.
[365:44.55]They found a boss in one of the Chalice Dungeons.
[365:46.45]You see, it's just crazy.
[365:52.22]Thank you, though.
[365:53.90]Good luck to you, Sasquatch.
[365:55.84]Bilbo Baggies, thanks for the five bucks.
[365:58.16]Thanks for the hilarious stream tonight.
[365:59.40]Always look forward to them.
[366:00.28]Been having a really shitty last couple of days, so coming here always helps me not think about it for a while.
[366:06.47]I'm sorry that you're not feeling good, man.
[366:07.85]I'm sorry that you're having a rough time.
[366:11.53]But like I've said dozens and dozens, if not hundreds of times before, you being able to have fun here
[366:19.70]It's... I... I... That is exactly what I want.
[366:23.72]So... Take care of yourself.
[366:25.95]Hopefully it turns around for you here.
[366:29.21]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $1.
[366:30.83]These new emotes are amazing.
[366:31.91]When are we going to get Jermabier?
[366:33.35]GoldenBier.
[366:34.45]Yeah, will be coming... I don't know.
[366:37.07]Shortly.
[366:38.43]Shortly.
[366:39.81]JohnArbuckle, thanks for the $0.25.
[366:41.01]Hey, Jerma, did you know that while... After...
[366:45.09]He's talking about cats and shit.
[366:47.30]Germer, do you know that a while after a cat owner's death, it'll start eating the body due to lack of food?
[366:52.56]Scary.
[366:54.34]Science.
[366:54.86]Thank you, Garfield.
[366:56.13]They're the same person.
[366:59.71]I'm convinced now.
[367:00.57]Garfield the Monday Killer, immediately after.
[367:02.53]25 cents.
[367:04.07]John Arbuckle, 25 cents.
[367:06.84]I think I found the mole.
[367:10.03]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer.
[367:12.13]My little kitten cousin wanted you to say smoo, pronounced like moo, but with an S before it.
[367:18.05]RJ the Raccoon asked if you could sum up your life in one... In one what?
[367:23.74]One sentence?
[367:24.36]I don't know.
[367:24.90]God Eye, thanks for the five dollars.
[367:26.32]Appreciate it.
[367:26.82]No message.
[367:27.26]Thank you.
[367:28.86]Win Surin, thanks for the one buck.
[367:30.64]I feel like I should clarify that I wasn't sure what bits did till like the third cheer.
[367:34.70]Anyways, have a nice night.
[367:42.75]You didn't know that you were paying me money?
[367:45.15]Oh, that's so funny.
[367:46.86]Holy shit, I just figured it out.
[367:48.32]I'm, like, giving this dude money.
[367:51.44]Well, hopefully you don't regret it.
[367:52.74]Thank you, man.
[367:53.92]Have a nice night.
[367:55.62]I figured it out.
[367:58.43]Hey, Garfy the Monday Killer is back with 25 cents.
[368:00.83]I accidentally sent the other bits while I was doing John's laundry.
[368:04.93]Anyway, he asked if you could sum up your life in one quote.
[368:08.17]Anyway, I came to ask for advice.
[368:10.47]Well, hold on a second.
[368:11.29]You're telling me... That's a very heavy question.
[368:14.92]Hey, can you sum up your whole life in one quote?
[368:17.24]Anyways!
[368:18.98]Hold on.
[368:20.70]Sum up my life in one quote.
[368:22.18]What's that Mark Twain quote?
[368:24.02]I'll get it.
[368:25.68]Mark Twain...
[368:28.80]That's a great quote.
[368:30.18]Let me see what it's called.
[368:33.60]Where is it?
[368:38.23]Here we go.
[368:41.05]No, not the size of the dog in the fight.
[368:43.23]Not that one.
[368:44.61]Where is it?
[368:45.03]I gotta find it.
[368:48.95]Brainy quotes.
[368:49.89]Give me the real quotes.
[368:55.96]Here we go.
[368:56.58]Here we go.
[368:57.72]Mark Twain.
[368:58.56]Bingo.
[368:58.86]One of my favorite quotes.
[369:02.28]Here's how to... Favorite quote.
[369:05.06]The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
[369:09.18]Mark Twain.
[369:10.46]Fucking brilliant scientist.
[369:13.09]He's got another one too that I really like.
[369:14.35]Where is it?
[369:17.33]Hold on.
[369:17.71]Hold on.
[369:21.31]Hold on.
[369:23.80]Bingo.
[369:24.44]Mark Twain again.
[369:25.88]Eat shit.
[369:27.46]No, not him.
[369:28.20]Not Mark Twain.
[369:29.24]Not you either.
[369:29.78]I don't know why I just said that.
[369:31.10]You can't depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus.
[369:35.57]Get fucked, man.
[369:37.43]How could you be such a genius?
[369:43.27]You mean author?
[369:45.01]Yeah, he's a great fucking book scientist for Christ's sake.
[369:54.46]Here we go.
[369:55.44]How about this one?
[369:58.96]It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt.
[370:06.29]Hey, go to heaven for the climate, hell for the company.
[370:09.35]Fucking guy with soap before his time.
[370:13.92]Never put off till tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow.
[370:17.34]Fucking goddamn genius.
[370:20.41]Hey, get your facts first.
[370:21.69]Get your facts first, then you can distort them as you please.
[370:25.57]Mark fucking Twain.
[370:28.99]In the first place, God made idiots.
[370:31.17]That was for practice.
[370:32.49]Then he made school boards.
[370:34.67]Oh, you fucking topical guy.
[370:37.17]Ow.
[370:37.83]Don't touch the glass.
[370:42.82]Alright, I'm getting lost.
[370:46.08]Hey, manboy777, thanks for the 25 cents.
[370:49.68]I want Jerma cheap.
[370:51.14]ASAP.
[370:51.84]I love it.
[370:54.00]Don't haha me here.
[370:55.58]I'll delete all the emotes.
[371:05.38]Anyways.
[371:06.82]This is a lot of money tonight.
[371:09.14]A lot of bits and a lot of donations.
[371:11.52]A lot of subs.
[371:12.20]Holy shit, guys.
[371:16.42]Subscribe to Jerma985.
[371:17.44]Mark Twain.
[371:24.27]Oh, look at all those emotes.
[371:25.17]I have a lot of emotes now.
[371:26.35]Cool.
[371:28.69]Uh, where are we here?
[371:30.85]Thank you, uh, CluelessSniper for the $1.
[371:32.67]These new emotes are amazing.
[371:34.65]Thank you.
[371:34.91]I think I got you already.
[371:36.23]I did.
[371:37.40]Hey, GodEye, thanks for the $5.
[371:38.58]Appreciate it, man.
[371:41.40]Did I already get you?
[371:42.32]Why am I all the way down here now?
[371:43.58]Captain Frodo, Captain Fordo, thanks for the $5.
[371:45.92]It's been a while since I've had a chance to watch or listen to one of your streams live because of work.
[371:51.22]Thanks for the laughs as always.
[371:52.29]Thank you, Fordo.
[371:53.35]Appreciate it.
[371:54.51]Captain Ford.
[371:56.33]Manboy777, thanks for the 25 cents.
[371:59.75]Please don't, um, what does it say?
[372:02.27]You want Jerma cheap, you already got it.
[372:03.87]It's jermaMustard.
[372:05.55]Bilbo Baggies, thanks for the 350.
[372:07.45]Meant to ask this earlier, but if you've ever played Simpsons Road Rage, it's a pretty fun game.
[372:12.17]I've never played Simpsons Road Rage.
[372:14.87]I've never played any of The Simpsons games that everybody wants me to play so bad.
[372:18.71]Isn't there Simpsons Hit and Run, right?
[372:21.89]We'll do that one day.
[372:24.90]Don't turn me in, says Bitslave, for 25 bits.
[372:27.38]I don't even need to.
[372:29.38]You've already incriminated yourself plenty of times.
[372:31.42]Thank you, Terralachrin, for the two bucks.
[372:35.70]Now that we got jermaPluto, when are we getting Jerma Uranus?
[372:38.10]I think there's no more planets.
[372:41.35]I was going to do Jerma Mercury, but there'd just be another shitty planet with my face on it, so... Pluto makes sense.
[372:48.77]It serves another emotion, right?
[372:50.47]It's a new emotion.
[372:51.65]We have all the emotions covered.
[372:54.28]Pretty much.
[372:55.93]Uh, Talamaker, Talamaka, thanks for the $1.
[372:59.07]I'm pretty new to your stream, but it's such a treasure to experience all your old work for the first time.
[373:04.70]Love you and your stream.
[373:05.52]Thanks, man.
[373:07.74]Welcome, first of all.
[373:12.54]Thank you for even watching and hanging out, and now you're giving me money.
[373:17.93]Welcome to the family.
[373:18.79]Thanks for the $1, dude.
[373:19.79]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $0.25.
[373:22.25]jermaSnort is the feel of wanting to rewind, but in reality, you cannot.
[373:25.83]It represents the longing of wanting for wanting to go back to your childhood and relive simpler times before the stress of taxes and bills.
[373:33.08]But in reality, there is no redo button, and you must move forward.
[373:36.80]I don't know, I'm just pissing in the wind.
[373:39.60]Thank you, Swifty Bagel, for the $1.
[373:41.18]jermaSnort equals regret.
[373:44.04]I guess it could, yeah.
[373:47.22]spec tag thanks to the 250. I'm actually angry at you for adding that piss stain emote but you don't want to add amazing emotes people made for you well that's hold on the piss stain emote is is just it we did it just for the stream it's only for the stream and here's a couple things to keep in mind alright I'm gonna go to emotes
[374:18.08]I only like to add emotes that... Oh, it's getting called out.
[374:25.48]But I don't want people to do work for me.
[374:29.73]You know what I mean?
[374:31.87]Sometimes people are like, oh, I made a bunch of emotes.
[374:34.07]Use them.
[374:34.55]It's like, I don't know, man.
[374:36.25]You made these.
[374:38.49]If I'm going to have somebody make emotes for me, I'd like them to be compensated and I'd like it to be...
[374:43.19]Not just, here, let me, I'll take that.
[374:46.06]Give me those free fucking things you made.
[374:47.66]I'm just gonna use them.
[374:48.62]Like, I don't like doing that.
[374:53.14]And this, I don't know, I feel like there's a little, there's a process to how many emotes I want to add.
[374:57.52]You know what I mean?
[375:01.82]Don't bother making stuff for him, he won't use it.
[375:05.60]That's not true.
[375:07.04]That's not true.
[375:08.50]Goddamn Goldman, give me your emotes.
[375:14.17]But no, here's the thing.
[375:18.79]There is going to be this last batch of emotes.
[375:23.10]I talked about it already, I think, but I have like 30 slots for emotes, right?
[375:30.28]And the idea was I was going to get one more batch of emotes that I make, or if Blordow makes them, Blordow was going to maybe... I contacted him to see if he'll do another batch.
[375:41.86]And then we were going to do an emote contest.
[375:47.25]Where I was going to just open it up to people.
[375:49.31]We were going to vote on them.
[375:50.87]It was going to be a whole process.
[375:52.47]Where the last five to ten slots were going to be community emotes.
[375:56.67]So that kind of...
[375:58.42]That's my solution to, because I don't know, it gets weird because somebody makes an emote, they tell me they want me to use it, somebody makes another emote, use this one, and all of a sudden you're, I'd like it to be official rather than just taking other people's work and just using it.
[376:15.69]And then, oh yeah, you made that emote.
[376:17.53]I remember, yeah, you did that.
[376:18.79]I just fucking put it on, I uploaded it, and I get money for it.
[376:21.57]You know what I'm saying?
[376:23.54]I'd rather it be an actual community effort than me just taking somebody's work and using it.
[376:29.52]If that makes any sense.
[376:31.64]So, the last ten emotes or so will be community emotes.
[376:35.85]Community voted, community made.
[376:39.61]So we can all have a say in it, right?
[376:43.33]jermaSnort is going to win.
[376:44.27]jermaSnort's already going to be there.
[376:47.37]I talked myself into jermaSnort.
[376:50.99]But hopefully that answers that question or that comment.
[376:57.85]Anywho.
[376:59.32]Thank you to Manboy again for the bits.
[377:02.56]There's a jermaMustard.
[377:03.54]I love it.
[377:03.90]Thank you.
[377:05.04]Manboy again.
[377:05.70]Uranus emote.
[377:08.08]No Uranus emote.
[377:08.86]We're not going to add one.
[377:09.86]No more planets anymore.
[377:13.49]Asian turtle.
[377:14.01]Thanks for the $1.
[377:14.69]This just looks like the Crypt Keeper.
[377:16.75]jermaPluto.
[377:18.41]I've seen it looks like a ghoul from Fallout.
[377:20.29]I've heard Crypt Keeper.
[377:21.60]I've heard latte art.
[377:23.78]Somebody said it looks like a fucking latte.
[377:25.28]I like that one probably the most.
[377:28.07]Thank you Devlon2Million for the one zero zero zero for the ten bucks.
[377:32.65]Hey Jerma, just got accepted into my dream college recently.
[377:35.49]I just wanted to thank you for keeping me sane through all these years of studying.
[377:40.28]Sometimes it felt like no matter how much effort I put in, I just wouldn't be enough.
[377:44.32]Your lightheartedness has melted away
[377:48.64]My school and life stresses time and time again.
[377:52.16]Melted away.
[377:52.74]Oh, okay, sorry.
[377:53.32]It was spaced out on the end there.
[377:58.12]On my screen.
[377:58.74]But thank you.
[378:00.56]I don't think I can fully repay you for all the good you've done me.
[378:03.83]So I'll just keep watching.
[378:04.83]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[378:06.59]First of all, congratulations on getting into your dream college.
[378:11.61]That's always a great feeling.
[378:12.99]I remember when I got accepted to college, it was...
[378:16.16]It was very stressful and very exciting, and I... I only got accepted to one college, so... I applied to, like, seven, and I only got accepted to, like, one.
[378:26.56]So... I was happy when I got that letter in the mail, let me tell you.
[378:33.48]Well, congratulations, dude.
[378:35.20]You don't have to repay me.
[378:37.86]Thank you so much for even considering.
[378:43.26]Have a wonderful time at fucking college.
[378:46.72]Work hard, though.
[378:48.28]Work hard, as Mark Twain once said.
[378:51.22]Work hard and play hard.
[378:54.38]That might have been on the back of a Budweiser bottle.
[378:56.69]Either way.
[378:58.31]Congratulations.
[379:00.15]Ermine762, thanks for the $5.
[379:01.73]You're ranked 937 on Social Blade.
[379:04.61]Yeah, top 1,000, baby.
[379:07.09]Just wait to win number one.
[379:09.09]You know?
[379:10.33]Wait to win number one, baby.
[379:12.37]You know what I'm saying?
[379:15.49]It ain't ever gonna happen, but I'm just telling you, just wait.
[379:20.51]Thank you, DSGZ, for the five dollars.
[379:24.00]Local streamer accosts poor people with literal... With literal refuse and claims to be doing them a service.
[379:36.26]Thank you.
[379:36.60]No soup for you for the $2.
[379:37.88]Here's part of the $5 I got for $0.90.
[379:40.78]Usually when I give bits, it's me complaining about shit, but this time I'm just going to say thanks for the laughs.
[379:44.36]Here's $2.
[379:44.60]Hey, soup.
[379:46.18]Thanks, man.
[379:48.36]Don't forget to smash that like button for Mark Twain.
[379:54.56]Hey, Maxi Kaspersky, the antivirus.
[379:58.24]Thanks for the $1.
[379:59.02]Streamer bankrupts Twitch over Reese's Pops.
[380:02.32]It's a good idea.
[380:03.24]I really think it is.
[380:04.78]Manboy777, hey, look, it's a Twitch clip!
[380:07.05]Wonder what it is!
[380:07.89]No, wait, this is different.
[380:09.19]This is different.
[380:10.99]It's not, it's not a snort.
[380:13.81]Get the fuck out of the way!
[380:15.47]Good cop!
[380:16.09]I'm trying to be a good police officer for crying out loud.
[380:21.84]That was crazy.
[380:23.32]Oh.
[380:34.54]That was fuck it.
[380:35.92]I love that.
[380:37.84]Blanket?
[380:38.74]Alright, here you go.
[380:45.99]Let me watch it one more time.
[380:51.63]Always being a good cop.
[380:53.05]What a fucking perfect video game.
[381:06.27]Anyways.
[381:08.45]Thank you, everybody.
[381:09.73]We're gonna rapid-fire the last... 10 bits!
[381:16.76]Thank you, Bitslave, at the 25 cents.

[381:21.14]No, no.
[381:21.82]Thank you, Fred Flintstone, for the $1.
[381:23.16]Fame changes a man.
[381:24.32]Remember when Jerma used to play games and do fun streams?
[381:27.13]Now he just stares at the camera and tells us, Be grateful you're witnessing the glory of the top 1,000 streamer on Twitch.
[381:33.05]Every three minutes.
[381:33.89]jermaPluto.
[381:36.10]Thank you BadRamLive for the $1.
[381:37.91]Have you ever heard of... BadRamLive for the $1.
[381:41.07]Have you ever heard of Ludum Dare?
[381:43.95]It's a rapid game development contest that usually gets a couple thousand submissions.
[381:47.90]I'll be participating in the next one happening this weekend, and we're always looking for judges.
[381:52.60]Maybe you'll finally be able to play 700,000 games.
[381:55.48]Slash elevator pitch.
[381:58.49]I've not heard of Ludum Dare.
[382:02.07]But, you know, participating in the next one, you might look up at judges.
[382:07.05]Um, shoot me a... What's your name?
[382:10.96]That's interesting.
[382:11.54]Shoot... Hold on a minute.
[382:12.66]Give me a, um... Give me a tweeter.
[382:15.66]Tweet at me and say that, and then I'll talk to you in your DMs.
[382:18.24]I'm curious about this.
[382:19.52]I'm not saying I'm gonna do it.
[382:21.50]You've curiosity-ed my peepness, you know what I mean?
[382:24.78]You've peed in my curiosity.
[382:28.33]Anyways, thank you to Bitslave again for 25 cents.
[382:31.63]Well, since you won't give me my job back, I'll speak on an IRL note.
[382:35.63]This is real.
[382:37.05]Okay.
[382:39.00]I'm joining the Air Force, hopefully, as a cryptologic language analyst.
[382:44.56]My ASVAB is this Thursday.
[382:46.76]Wish me luck.
[382:47.36]I need a G72 to get that job when I have to pass my DLAB.
[382:52.89]I'll let you know how I did on Thursday, my lord.
[382:54.69]Please let me steal bits for real, though.
[382:57.71]Alright, well... If this is real... I wish you the best of luck.
[383:06.14]I hope you pass it.
[383:07.46]Hope you do well.
[383:08.14]That sounds like a... That sounds like a very, very highly skilled, intelligent job.
[383:15.65]Hopefully, um, you do well.
[383:17.39]Good luck to you, man.
[383:19.21]Hey, new soap for you.
[383:20.23]Like, no soap for you.
[383:21.79]No soup for you.
[383:22.84]Thanks for the $1.
[383:23.66]Just spent another $1.40 to remind you to talk to Charlie about the official podcast.
[383:28.80]If you like, I can spam with you.
[383:30.50]Spam you.
[383:34.94]I've had a busy- I've had a fuckin' hectic couple weeks.
[383:38.54]Alright.
[383:39.36]I'll- I'll look out, get in touch with him.
[383:42.78]I actually was gonna randomly tweet him.
[383:45.56]But I didn't know if he would understand that I wasn't, like, serious.
[383:49.08]He made- what did he say?
[383:50.58]He made, like, a really, really, like... He made, like, a tweet, like, a really gross tweet about something.
[383:56.62]It was, like, a sexual fuckin' weird-ass tweet.
[383:59.63]And I was gonna reply to the tweet and just be like, this is disgusting.
[384:03.87]Like, people want me to go on your show.
[384:06.31]I will not support this disgusting, offensive material.
[384:08.85]I was gonna go off on him.
[384:10.31]Like, fake, like, angry at his tweet.
[384:13.39]But I didn't because I didn't know if he was gonna, like, be pissed off about that.
[384:18.55]Or not understand that I'm just being a fucking weirdo.
[384:22.89]I don't know what it was.
[384:28.09]I was gonna just pretend to be very, very offended by him.
[384:32.99]But, we'll see.
[384:35.28]Uh, thank you, Taralacrin, for the two bucks.
[384:37.42]Can we get an after-show hangout screen?
[384:41.08]Yeah, we will.
[384:43.12]We will be using this.
[384:43.82]Hey, Etalyx gave me 25 cents.
[384:45.22]Is this how I get noticed, senpai?
[384:46.66]Don't, don't say senpai.
[384:49.25]You're saying it ironically, but my god.
[384:53.25]Get him out of here.
[384:55.99]Hey, Charlie, are you going Paxos here?
[385:01.77]Uh, let's see what we got here.
[385:02.99]Bitslay, thanks again.
[385:04.37]Good luck.
[385:05.43]Wild, buddy.
[385:06.05]Thanks for the 30 cents.
[385:06.73]I just stopped.
[385:07.25]I got stopped for a survey today about cryptocurrency.
[385:11.11]And when he asked me if I owned any, I responded with, yeah, I've got a bald coin.
[385:14.67]The look he gave me was priceless.
[385:18.39]It's not worth very much.
[385:21.43]Maxi Kaspersky, thanks for the $1.
[385:22.78]Eat shit.
[385:23.82]Top 1000 streamer.
[385:25.22]Jerma985, thank you.

[386:22.65]Me and Star.
[386:25.94]I don't know because me and Star used to make videos together all the time.
[386:28.70]We would kind of go back and forth with uploading.
[386:31.68]It would be like, oh, whose idea was it?
[386:33.38]Then I'm going to upload it.
[386:34.60]Oh, it was my idea.
[386:35.86]You know, come on.
[386:38.74]Holy shit, that game looks like a PlayStation 1 game.
[386:40.73]Yeah, it's always the Monopoly guy.
[386:44.71]I know, I just didn't know whose channel.
[386:45.87]I mean, we made a couple of them.
[386:50.61]Anyways, let's keep going.
[386:53.19]Almost done.
[386:53.77]Charcoal rules, thanks for the 25 cents.
[386:55.27]Hey, Jerma, always want to hear your life advice.
[386:57.73]But my one question I want to know is what is your best conversation starter?
[387:03.78]Are we talking... Are you talking about looking for friends?
[387:09.04]Or are you talking about how to, you know, talking to like a girl or talking to another guy or something, you know?
[387:12.62]Are you talking romantic?
[387:14.48]Or are you talking just normal, like, hey, how are you?
[387:17.58]Like, let's be friends.
[387:19.45]Well, first of all, I can't help you with the second one, because I'm awful at that.
[387:26.58]But, best conversation starter.
[387:31.24]You want to go to, you want to get Larry Anderson's Jaw Droppers.
[387:36.70]And you want to get the whole set, all the DVDs, all the VHSs of Larry Anderson's Jaw Droppers.
[387:42.32]We watched a couple of them on stream.
[387:44.15]And you want to do a little magic trick.
[387:45.97]Actually, don't do this, because this is, like, weird.
[387:47.71]It's weird.
[387:49.83]Damn it!
[387:50.27]Stop playing with fucking knives!
[387:58.10]If only the webcam was on and you guys saw what just happened.
[388:02.36]That just exploded.
[388:05.84]That blew up in my hands.
[388:07.56]Have you ever seen the video where the guy has the thing and he's like, wow, this is precious.
[388:11.03]And you see the grooves, the tracks go this way.
[388:14.71]And what you see... Shit.
[388:17.37]That's an old meme video.
[388:18.57]I just did it.
[388:20.20]The guy's showing an old radio device.
[388:21.96]I just did that.
[388:23.08]Put the knife down.
[388:32.88]This is a one of a kind.
[388:33.77]Yeah, that just happened to me.
[388:38.01]Anyways, advice, conversation starters.
[388:40.83]Probably...
[388:42.96]Talk shit about where you are.
[388:44.40]That usually happens.
[388:45.20]That's usually pretty cool, right?
[388:46.22]If you're at a bar or something.
[388:48.32]Or, you know, you got invited and you sit at a table.
[388:52.43]It's not, you know, people like to understand that everyone gets it, right?
[388:56.05]So you can make a comment about the bathroom and how dirty it was or something.
[388:59.85]You know, you get out, you take a piss, you come back, you sit down, you're like, hey, you mind if I sit?
[389:04.25]Like, jeez, you see the fucking bathroom?
[389:06.85]It's like, what, are they trying to shoot a movie rain scene in there?
[389:11.31]Why is it?
[389:11.67]It's just fucking soaking wet.
[389:14.50]And then they'll be like, what the fuck?
[389:17.44]Sit down!
[389:18.02]I want to talk to you!
[389:19.22]Sit down!
[389:20.48]And then that's your only joke that you've been working on for like six hours, and you got nothing else.
[389:25.18]Go get jaw droppers, in that case, because you're going to have to do something else that fucking pleases them.
[389:33.34]Yeah, the dumpster sucks.
[389:36.40]Yeah, I'll go and sit down.
[389:37.27]Man, they got a shitty dumpster here, man.
[389:41.23]I mean, like, I got like two bags of chips out of there.
[389:43.83]That ain't good shit.
[389:49.11]Hey, you come here often?
[389:53.10]Then you learn they're a big Hollywood agent and they want more of those jokes.
[390:00.42]No.
[390:01.29]Just be yourself.
[390:02.75]Say what you feel and say whatever you're thinking, as long as it's appropriate.
[390:07.33]People like real people, not people pretending to be other people.
[390:12.29]You know when you can just sit down and you just know that somebody's just bullshitting the whole time?
[390:19.74]Then you could just usually sense everything they're saying is just not even real.
[390:23.44]And everything that they're doing, all their body language, is just like a charade.
[390:27.73]Don't be one of those people.
[390:29.05]People don't like those people.
[390:30.55]Be one of those people that is a person.
[390:31.91]A real person.
[390:32.53]A you.
[390:33.37]Be you.
[390:33.87]Be yourself.
[390:35.55]I hate that too.
[390:36.11]Yeah, I got something to make your jaw drop.
[390:46.60]Are you a fan of acid base?
[390:50.09]But anyways, let's keep going.
[390:51.64]I know we're up late tonight, so... Thank you to... Broluck.
[390:59.20]Please actually add Dermasnort.
[391:01.30]I'd spam that emote on every Twitch channel.
[391:03.34]Don't do that, though.
[391:04.28]Don't make people... Lookin'.
[391:06.39]Lookin'.
[391:08.07]KFC.
[391:08.65]It's finger lickin' good.
[391:10.61]Listen.
[391:11.53]Don't spam my emotes on other people's channels.
[391:14.01]Because then I become the weird guy that nobody likes.
[391:18.10]What the fuck is this emote, and why is people just spamming it?
[391:22.16]Okay.
[391:23.32]Fuck that guy.
[391:24.52]What's his name, Jermo?
[391:25.52]Oh, he's got like planets and shit?
[391:28.26]God fucking, I never talked to that guy at Twitch party.
[391:31.43]I'm gonna meet that guy at the Twitch party, I'm gonna throw my drink in his face.
[391:37.59]I'm a normal guy.
[391:39.77]You're already that guy.
[391:41.43]No, I'm not.
[391:44.85]Well, I mean, I guess if I look at that emote with jermaPluto, I guess maybe I could be that guy.
[391:51.11]Saying that is how to ensure that jermaSnort never exists.
[391:59.52]Yeah, I know.
[392:01.64]You want me to give you guys an emote for the sole reason to spam an ugly fucking face I made to other people that don't know me?
[392:09.67]Their first impression's gonna be that ugly fucking snorting mouth, and they're gonna not like me.
[392:16.11]I'm gonna already get- look, that's a top 1,000 streamer.
[392:19.36]I think we need to be very clear, we need to be careful how we utilize this power.
[392:23.50]Alright, I gotta move on.
[392:30.64]Hey, hey Katie4812, thanks for the $1.
[392:34.16]Remember when Jerma said that jermaSaturn wasn't as big as the jermaMoon?
[392:39.39]It's not.
[392:40.99]Not even close.
[392:43.87]Thank you.
[392:44.79]Thank you, Zamanreal, for the $1.
[392:46.55]Where did the rumor of you being short come from?
[392:48.37]Is it because you're short?
[392:49.97]Take a look at the evidence.
[392:50.79]It's out there.
[392:51.83]Go be a detective.
[392:53.63]There's plenty of evidence to show that I am absolutely not.
[392:56.98]Just look it up, the evidence.
[392:59.02]Thank you, though, for the $1.
[392:59.90]Thank you, SwiftyBagel, for the $0.25.
[393:01.58]Forgot to say it's what you played years ago, but it's had a massive update and is much better.
[393:05.90]Really.
[393:07.60]Really.
[393:10.84]So Spy Party is... They actually... That game's been in development for five years.
[393:17.16]Is it actually good now?
[393:18.28]Well, it was good before.
[393:19.90]I mean... Technically and aesthetically.
[393:23.55]Ten years, actually.
[393:25.05]That's fucking crazy.
[393:25.65]Eight years.
[393:26.15]Unbelievable.
[393:35.78]Uh, thank you, Teralachrin, for the two bucks.
[393:37.95]Why do you hate the planet Uranus so much?
[393:40.33]This is boring.
[393:42.49]It's, it's, it's... You know, guys, there are, like, four blue planets.
[393:46.21]I'm not gonna do four blue emote faces.
[393:49.77]Neptune, Uranus, uh, the... Blue planets.
[394:00.40]Yeah, we got Earth...
[394:04.89]Uranus.
[394:06.33]Neptune.
[394:08.03]Like three fucking planets are blue.
[394:09.93]I'm not doing Uranus.
[394:10.74]I'm not doing Neptune.
[394:11.44]They're both blue.
[394:12.08]It's the same.
[394:12.56]It'll be the same emote.
[394:13.40]You're not getting it.
[394:17.90]He said Uranus.
[394:19.40]Yeah, because it's the name of a fucking goddamn solar... It wouldn't be solar.
[394:24.93]It'd be... Neb... What am I trying to say here?
[394:31.87]Galactic?
[394:32.93]It's a galactic sphere.
[394:35.19]It's blue.
[394:38.27]Anyways, thank you to Tavolactrin, again, for the $1.
[394:44.16]I'm a game dev in real life, and I can definitely back up the Ludum Dare.
[394:47.70]It's a pretty fun time.
[394:48.62]The top games are usually pretty great.
[394:50.04]I don't know.
[394:54.05]I'll definitely give it a look.
[394:56.37]I will give it a check, you know?
[394:58.57]That sounds cool.
[395:00.25]Hey, MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1.
[395:01.37]I think there's something wrong with the stream.
[395:02.98]Every 10 minutes or so, a picture of your face with hollowed out eyes pops up for a few seconds.
[395:07.46]Might want to look into that.
[395:09.22]Also, use my pee song.
[395:12.18]Oh, yeah, I was going to make a new video for that.
[395:13.72]Thanks for reminding me.
[395:16.18]I have to export a new video.
[395:17.53]Thank you.
[395:19.39]Thank you, Moo.
[395:21.29]NoV333, thanks for the $1.
[395:23.09]On a recent stream, Charlie said you can come on his podcast whenever you want.
[395:27.30]There you go.
[395:27.87]It's an open invitation.
[395:28.99]It could happen today.
[395:29.69]It could happen in a couple years.
[395:30.93]Maybe it could just happen eventually, you know?
[395:34.89]Thank you Bang9c9 for the 25 cents for the knife safety fund.
[395:38.33]Thank you, dude.
[395:40.30]Didn't break any skin.
[395:41.00]I'm fine.
[395:42.64]MooMeansMoo again.
[395:43.60]And BroLuckTheLastTwo for $1 each on his preferred opening lines.
[395:48.38]Please them.
[395:49.48]Give them a few jaw droppers.
[395:51.26]Jerma985.
[395:52.15]That's me.
[395:55.82]Yeah, well... Yeah, that's true.
[395:57.16]It'll be fine.
[395:57.58]And with that, I will see you guys on Thursday.
[396:23.31]Take care.
[396:23.83]Have a good rest of your evening.
[396:25.05]Thanks for staying up late.
[396:28.69]Thank you for staying up.
[396:32.33]Probably not going to do a stream this long on Thursday.
[396:35.16]I don't think we're going to be able to.
[396:38.04]I can't imagine there's much more than four or five hours of content in True Crime.
[396:43.02]But it's always been a blast.
[396:45.36]Take care, guys.
[396:47.48]See you soon.
[396:48.72]Have a good rest of your night.
[396:50.80]Ta-ta.
[396:59.48]Thank you.
