[00:02.51]Hello and welcome to Jerma's first ever spooky trivia night.
[00:09.39]I'm your host, Shannon Sharon, and you're involved tonight as well here at home.
[00:15.24]We have you here on chat, so you'll be answering some of our questions.
[00:18.72]Let's go ahead and introduce our guests over here.
[00:21.99]We have first up, Jeremiah.
[00:25.22]That's me, Jeremiah985.
[00:26.90]You all know who I am.
[00:28.40]Do I need an introduction?
[00:29.62]I'm going to destroy.
[00:30.28]This is trivia round, which you're involved in.
[00:32.78]By the way, happy Halloween, those of you that are having parties.
[00:36.12]Hope you have fun.
[00:38.46]I mean, I'm stuck here doing trivia, but I plan on destroying.
[00:41.28]I plan on doing very well.
[00:42.60]This is you guys here.
[00:44.22]This is chat.
[00:45.44]That's you.
[00:47.20]I feel like I'm going to be, I feel pretty confident.
[00:48.68]I really do.
[00:49.73]I'm glad that you feel that way.
[00:50.93]Let's see what the board says afterwards.
[00:53.47]So, secondly, we have you here, chat.
[00:55.67]You can see yourselves.
[00:56.59]Smile and wave, boys.
[00:58.63]And lastly, welcome back, Dr. Schmortzen.
[01:01.08]How are you doing tonight?
[01:02.62]Absolutely wonderful.
[01:03.78]Thank you, Sharon.
[01:04.90]I'm so glad to hear that.
[01:06.10]I hope you're having a spooky day.
[01:08.22]Very spooky.
[01:09.40]I got scared in the car.
[01:11.38]Did I tell you that?
[01:12.39]That's concerning.
[01:13.17]What happened?
[01:14.21]I don't remember.
[01:15.43]They took my memories.
[01:16.31]It's weird.
[01:17.07]They?
[01:17.89]There was multiple.
[01:18.77]It was like 30.
[01:19.61]I mean, that's fine.
[01:20.43]It was very strange.
[01:22.37]Are we even live?
[01:24.85]Oh, we are.
[01:25.21]OK.
[01:25.63]Hey, welcome, everybody.
[01:26.71]Welcome to the trivia section.
[01:28.37]So how do we do this?
[01:31.17]How do we do this?
[01:31.83]Alright, well, let's introduce our first categories here today.
[01:34.97]Here are today's categories.
[01:38.11]We have 17th century poetry.
[01:41.53]That's a good one.
[01:42.83]Super good.
[01:45.03]My favorite.
[01:47.25]Oh, I need to change this.
[01:48.47]By the way, if you're having a Halloween party right now, pump up the music.
[01:53.68]No, no, actually, turn the music down because you want to be able to hear us.
[01:56.78]You want to be able to hear what we're doing.
[01:58.06]Alright.
[01:59.14]So, again, here we are with today's categories.
[02:01.92]First off, we have 17th century poetry.
[02:04.81]Okay.
[02:06.00]Next off, wide open space.
[02:08.98]Interesting.
[02:09.68]Thirdly, Goosebumps books part one.
[02:14.17]Yes!
[02:15.49]He's pumped.
[02:17.45]Water, water everywhere.
[02:21.73]To be or not to be?
[02:25.70]Sounds pretty good.
[02:26.92]And lastly, spooky things.
[02:30.17]Alright.
[02:30.77]Because it's Halloween, right?
[02:33.19]Jeremiah, as this is your show, would you like to kick us off here?
[02:36.91]I get to go first?
[02:37.87]You do.
[02:38.59]Just this one time.
[02:41.43]I'll take 17th century poetry for 50, please.
[02:43.71]Alright.
[02:44.59]Let's see what we got here.
[02:48.63]John Calvin crafted this Christian ideology stressing God's power and the moral weakness of human beings that many of the era's poets followed.
[03:03.47]What is... You got anything?
[03:07.07]Dr. Strange?
[03:08.25]I have no idea.
[03:09.47]And time's up.
[03:11.01]Alright, Dr. Schmoytson, what do you got for us?
[03:13.47]Yes, Shannon.
[03:14.89]It's what is Calvinism?
[03:18.95]Congratulations, Dr. Schmoytson.
[03:20.53]You have won the first points of the evening.
[03:23.33]And as the rules of our super generic non-trademark finding show goes, you get to pick the next category.
[03:30.49]What would you like to go for?
[03:32.12]I will continue with 17th century poetry, please, for 200.
[03:37.22]200?
[03:37.24]Alright.
[03:39.18]Let's start racking up these points here.
[03:42.16]Now, followers of Ben Johnson touted themselves as this family-oriented namesake.
[03:52.71]Who are the sons of Ben?
[03:56.69]Well done, alright.
[03:57.97]Sons of Ben, okay.
[03:58.37]The Sons of Ben, who are the Sons of Ben?
[04:00.04]Pretty good job, nice work done.
[04:02.46]Appreciate the nice work.
[04:03.82]Yeah, got some, alright.
[04:06.42]So now we're at 250 solid points here, taking us off in the lead.
[04:11.81]Next category.
[04:13.67]How about, Shannon, wide open spaces for 400, please.
[04:18.51]Alright, Dr. Schmolzen, let's see what's in this category.
[04:22.20]Let's open up this box.
[04:24.08]This curious individual was the first person to ever look at the moon through a telescope.
[04:32.14]Who is Thomas Harriot?
[04:36.18]Thomas Harry?
[04:37.38]Who is Thomas Harry?
[04:38.50]Yes, that would be the correct answer.
[04:40.64]Thank you, Dr. Schmoytson.
[04:41.81]That was Galileo.
[04:42.83]Wasn't it Galileo?
[04:44.37]I'm not sure that Wikipedia would agree with you.
[04:46.71]Is that even correct?
[04:47.53]Apologies for this.
[04:48.19]That's not even correct.
[04:48.87]That's not a correct answer.
[04:49.93]Galileo was the first person, wasn't it?
[04:51.33]No, that's right.
[04:54.72]Who the fuck is Thomas Harry?
[04:56.80]Why do you know that?
[04:57.94]He's a goddamn doctor.
[04:59.92]What am I talking about?
[05:01.50]Go on.
[05:01.93]Alright.
[05:02.55]Sorry about that, Dr. Schmortzen.
[05:03.75]We have a little bit of a rowdy crowd this evening.
[05:05.77]It wasn't Galileo?
[05:07.01]Would you like to take us to the next question?
[05:10.19]Yes, please.
[05:12.17]17th century poetry once again for 400, please.
[05:16.09]400.
[05:17.61]Alright.
[05:20.19]A religious allegory by John Bunyan which has never been out of print and was the first ever novel written in English.
[05:31.78]What is Pilgrim's Progress?
[05:35.38]What is the Pilgrim's Progress?
[05:38.15]Well done.
[05:39.55]Can I ask?
[05:39.91]Yes, Jeremiah.
[05:40.91]How many of these are you going to get right?
[05:42.41]Can I answer a question?
[05:43.79]Is that possible?
[05:45.39]If you could get one right, yes.
[05:47.57]I got the first one wrong, but alright.
[05:49.51]Go ahead.
[05:49.90]Keep going.
[05:51.56]Alright.
[05:52.00]Dr. Schmoyson, take us back.
[05:53.94]Surely.
[05:55.76]Let's go with wide open spaces for 800 please.
[05:59.81]Alright, wide open spaces for 800.
[06:03.85]Measuring at negative 240 degrees Celsius, this is the coldest known spot in our solar system.
[06:10.65]Ah, yes.
[06:11.13]Do you know it well, Dr. Smarton?
[06:14.23]I do.
[06:15.31]What is the lunar south pole?
[06:18.96]What?
[06:19.48]What is the lunar south pole?
[06:21.06]Yes.
[06:21.20]No, it's Neptune.
[06:22.21]That is the correct answer.
[06:23.65]What?
[06:25.16]Neptune.
[06:25.84]Is it Neptune?
[06:27.08]I thought Neptune was the coolest spot on the galaxy.
[06:29.22]What were the questions?
[06:30.81]Idiot.
[06:32.71]Oh, my.
[06:33.93]Oh, my.
[06:34.23]It seems like we have a little bit of a while over here, folks, on this evening's show.
[06:38.53]Alright, Dr. Schmoytson, you're taking us away here.
[06:41.73]What are you going to crush next?
[06:43.73]Certainly, let's go for water, water everywhere.
[06:48.21]Alright.
[06:49.19]Four?
[06:49.91]How many points?
[06:50.75]How about 200 points?
[06:53.33]Water, water everywhere for 200 points.

[07:09.12]Alright, let's take a look at that answer.
[07:10.78]What is the Dead Sea?
[07:12.26]Cracked a mundo there, Dr. Schmoyson.
[07:14.74]Jeremiah, how are you feeling right now?
[07:15.76]You should have invited Burger Boy.
[07:17.76]Because we're getting all these answers right.
[07:20.34]So if he gets it wrong, then I get it right.
[07:23.36]I can answer, or we can answer, right?
[07:25.30]Should he ever?
[07:25.90]We're in this together.
[07:26.66]Yeah, chat.
[07:26.96]We're both in this together.
[07:27.62]Chat, how you feeling right now?
[07:28.80]How's it going out there for you folks?
[07:31.18]I mean, I kind of wish I could answer a question.
[07:34.34]I feel like chat feels the same way.
[07:37.91]Go on.
[07:38.53]Go on.
[07:38.79]No, keep going.
[07:40.13]Alright, Dr. Schmoytson, take us away.
[07:42.11]Alright, let's try.
[07:45.67]To be or not to be for 50.

[07:59.90]Dr. Schmoytson, might you know?
[08:02.56]Jeremy seems to know, unfortunately.
[08:04.56]Who is Bugs Bunny?
[08:05.76]That's Bugs Bunny!
[08:08.16]We get double points.
[08:09.21]Put that down here.
[08:09.99]I get points for that.
[08:11.91]Let's take a quick point check.
[08:13.69]What do we got here?
[08:14.93]So we have Jeremy, proudly.
[08:17.70]Would you mind saying aloud what your points may be?
[08:21.46]How well are you doing this evening?
[08:22.50]Zero.
[08:22.98]Zero.
[08:23.50]Okay.
[08:24.12]Alright.
[08:25.36]We have chat over here also with zero.
[08:27.58]Sorry, guys.
[08:28.18]Bring back the doctor.
[08:29.20]This is what happened.
[08:30.46]I swear to God.
[08:32.64]You bring the good doctor back.
[08:35.05]And he just, okay.
[08:36.12]I mean, he's a doctor.
[08:37.66]He's a doctor.
[08:38.52]What are you going to do about it?
[08:40.26]Dr. Schmoytson proudly here with 2,100 points.
[08:43.64]Doing pretty good.
[08:44.64]Doing pretty good.
[08:45.38]I will give you, I commend you.
[08:46.66]Doing well.
[08:47.10]Doing pretty well.
[08:47.70]As we should.
[08:48.28]Good sportsmanship is always appreciated here.
[08:50.42]Love to answer a question.
[08:51.06]On our first ever spooky.
[08:52.65]I would love to talk on my own stream.
[08:54.31]It'd be great.
[08:56.87]Eventually.
[08:58.35]I've got the buzzer here, but go on.
[09:01.76]Alright, Dr. Schmoytson, what would you like to blow us away with next?
[09:04.74]Let's go for 17th century poetry for 100, please.
[09:10.02]It's going to be easy.
[09:11.73]It's going to be like, who is... One of the most influential poetic figures of this era.
[09:16.57]Most know him now by only two syllables.
[09:20.19]Who is Voltaire?
[09:24.20]And the answer, yes.
[09:25.58]Who is Voltaire?
[09:26.58]Congratulations, Dr. Schmoytson.
[09:29.41]You really know your stuff, what can I say?
[09:31.07]How do you know all this stuff?
[09:32.77]It's frankly quite embarrassing.
[09:33.75]You're a lie detector doctor.
[09:35.34]You shouldn't know all this information.
[09:38.15]Maybe you do.
[09:38.76]I don't know.
[09:39.72]Maybe.
[09:40.66]Alright, Dr. Schmoytson.
[09:42.70]Next category.
[09:43.70]Yes, indeed, Shannon.
[09:45.00]Go on, which category do you want to do, doc?
[09:46.36]Let's try to continue.
[09:48.46]Let's try with To Be or Not To Be for 400, please.
[09:52.59]To Be or Not To Be for 400.
[09:55.55]Alright.
[09:56.83]Parker, Griffin, and Dinklage.
[09:59.35]All famous faces sharing this common name.
[10:02.01]Dr. Schmoytson.
[10:04.26]Yes, I believe that is...
[10:08.41]Beater.
[10:08.99]Who's Beater?
[10:10.66]Who?
[10:11.18]What is Beater?
[10:12.32]What?
[10:13.82]What?
[10:15.06]What?
[10:16.02]There's no way you know that question's answer.
[10:18.96]What do you mean?
[10:20.58]I should have known that.
[10:21.52]What does that mean?
[10:23.70]What just happened?
[10:25.28]I mean, that's why you have it.
[10:27.08]Alright, Dr. Schmoytson, take us away.
[10:28.52]Really getting crushed out here.
[10:29.98]I could have got that question right.
[10:30.76]How much was that worth?
[10:31.28]Really getting crushed out here.
[10:33.41]Let's try.
[10:34.79]Whatever.
[10:35.39]Are you quite done?
[10:36.60]Yeah.
[10:38.32]Let's try to be or not to be for 800, please.
[10:42.52]Alright.
[10:43.44]Oh, looks like we have a daily double.
[10:45.82]Daily double.
[10:47.26]Daily double.
[10:47.96]Hooray.
[10:49.82]Is it worth double points?
[10:51.94]How does that work?
[10:52.38]I hope not, for your sake.
[10:54.98]The best hand is a natural nine in this Bond beloved card game.
[10:59.29]Dr. Schmoytson?
[11:00.57]Yes, that is poker.
[11:04.15]I'm sorry, sir?
[11:05.65]Oh, I can't answer, I'm sorry.
[11:06.81]Mr. Elbertson?
[11:07.87]Are you ready to let them answer?
[11:10.21]And that question is, what is baccarat?
[11:14.27]What is baccarat?
[11:15.39]Congratulations, Dr. Schmoytson, you get another several hundred points.
[11:20.19]Yes.
[11:21.09]This is fucking stupid.
[11:22.67]Alright.
[11:23.09]Dr. Albert.
[11:24.15]No, I'm sorry.
[11:24.89]You're not the doctor.
[11:26.37]Mr. Elbertson.
[11:27.23]I went to school, just so you know.
[11:28.53]I imagine.
[11:29.11]Yeah.
[11:29.88]But not for any of these.
[11:31.20]Sorry.
[11:31.86]It's a clown school.
[11:33.12]Alright.
[11:33.96]Dr. Schmoytson, what do you got for us?
[11:36.58]Ah, Shannon.
[11:37.22]Alright.
[11:37.58]We're ready again.
[11:38.40]Let's try wide open spaces for 50, please.
[11:41.51]Okay, they're really still going for the low points here.
[11:44.97]I mean, really racking them up.
[11:48.08]The flattest planet in our solar system.
[11:50.10]This was originally thought to be three separate planets.
[11:54.10]Yes, because of... Can you get me a drink?
[11:57.50]What is Saturn?
[12:00.08]What is Saturn?
[12:02.24]Alright, yes.
[12:03.82]Congratulations, you've won yet another question.
[12:07.99]Mr. Elbertson, how you feeling?
[12:10.76]Oh, would you like to hear from me?
[12:12.88]Just this once.
[12:13.40]Is that what this is?
[12:15.52]No, this is alright, I guess.
[12:16.56]We're supposed to be able to play together, and 20 hindsight, it really was probably a bad idea to bring somebody that was that smart.
[12:25.08]We need like 50 IQ people up here, because I have like 72 IQ, which is not very good.
[12:30.42]Oh, he's falling asleep.
[12:31.68]Oh, that's not great.
[12:32.38]Oh, okay.
[12:33.26]Alright.
[12:33.88]Alright, Dr. Johnson.
[12:34.58]This guy.
[12:34.84]This guy.
[12:35.38]Me and this guy.
[12:36.52]What do you got for us, Dr. Johnson?
[12:37.60]We got history.
[12:38.83]Are you quite ready?
[12:40.88]Let's try, Sharon, to start to wrap things up.
[12:44.90]Let's try Water, Water, Everywhere for 800, please.
[12:50.39]Alright, bigger points.
[12:52.31]This lake just sits at an interesting junction between the borders of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.
[12:59.21]Yes.
[13:01.11]Lake Mead?
[13:03.08]No, that's in Vegas.
[13:05.16]What is Lake Constance?
[13:08.49]Alright, yes, what is Lake Constance?
[13:11.71]Wow, I'm not sure that we've ever had a streak this long on the show.
[13:14.90]Thank you, Dr. Schmortzen.
[13:16.88]Alright, take us away.
[13:18.04]What's your next pick here?
[13:20.62]And only a few left.
[13:24.66]How about 17th century poetry for 800, please?
[13:29.17]Alright.
[13:30.54]What do we have?
[13:31.67]Oh, I'm sorry about that, folks.
[13:32.99]That's all we have time for.
[13:34.11]What do you mean, that's all we have time for?
[13:35.65]That's all we have time for, for round one.
[13:37.10]Round one is over.
[13:38.08]Yes.
[13:38.22]And Dr. Schmunkson has 5,050 points.
[13:43.29]Let's do a quick point check here.
[13:45.27]Jerima, rolling in with zero points.
[13:49.13]Chat, also with zero.
[13:50.92]We didn't get a chance.
[13:52.30]And Dr. Schmoytsen at 5,050 points.
[13:57.04]How you feeling there, Dr. Schmoytsen?
[13:58.14]Can I take off this Lisa Simpson mask?
[14:00.26]I'm having quite an evening.
[14:01.44]Thank you, Shannon.
[14:02.48]Unbelievable.
[14:03.18]Oh, I'm so glad that you're enjoying yourselves.
[14:04.98]I'm not sure about Mr. Elvis.
[14:06.76]There's a second round.
[14:07.74]There is a second round, yes.
[14:08.86]Alright, thanks.
[14:09.56]We're supposed to be banking points.
[14:11.57]Alright.
[14:11.91]Does this use a buzzer, too?

[27:12.44]do you do you know I could take a pretty good guess uh... that Jacob first right now you go for you go for jelly efforts alright so it seems that there's a little bit of a split in chat really but he is winning so Chad believes that you had fifty thousand followers under one hundred uploads I don't think so I think it's more
[27:43.06]No, or less.
[27:44.82]100, okay, my first, my first like 40 uploads went to like 30 people.
[27:52.40]I know that for a fact.

[27:59.92]I'm gonna write, I'm going with A. A?
[28:02.35]Alright, so Jerma's coming in with A. It might be a little too low.
[28:06.09]Chat has B. Dr. Schmoytson?

[28:12.16]You know what YouTube is?
[28:18.73]C?

[47:44.12]Let's go.
[47:44.52]Bring it in.
[47:45.38]Goosebumps for $2,000.
[47:49.31]In monster blood, what is the name of the witch that gives the blood its abilities?
[47:54.57]A, Sarabeth, B, Ymiridin, C, Valshesh, D, Sindral.
[48:09.24]In monster blood.
[48:12.11]Yes.
[48:12.91]You ever read the Goosebumps books?
[48:15.67]No.
[48:16.75]He must like reading Doctor.
[48:18.91]Yes, certainly.
[48:19.59]Doctor, Professor.
[48:20.33]I mean, you've read a lot of books, but have any of them been Goosebumps books?
[48:23.39]I don't think you're allowed to wear elbow patches if you don't read all of them.
[48:26.71]Oh, come on.
[48:27.76]Goosebumps?
[48:28.84]Goosebumps?
[48:29.60]Yeah, R.L.
[48:30.16]Stine.
[48:30.62]Great literature?
[48:32.28]Yeah, okay.
[48:32.86]That's good stuff.
[48:34.25]Alright, I got my answer.
[48:35.73]Okay.
[48:37.73]My reasoning for this answer is it's the only one that has an apostrophe in it.
[48:43.27]So that makes sense to me.
[48:44.61]So I'm going to say Valshesh, C. C, Valshesh.
[48:49.14]Because that's like, oh, it's a scary name because it's like, oh, it's Valshesh.
[48:52.62]It's like a different, you know, that makes sense to me.
[48:55.90]And Chat, what was your answer?
[48:58.00]What was Chat say?
[49:02.47]Chet says A, Sarah Beth.
[49:04.41]That's like a regular name.
[49:06.11]It's a very regular name.
[49:08.56]Hello to all the Sarah Beths out there.
[49:10.84]Professor?
[49:15.06]Val Shess.
[49:17.68]That's a good answer.
[49:18.36]So we have two C's and an A. That means I'm as smart as a doctor, by the way, if anyone watching.
[49:22.18]That means I'm as intelligent as C is.
[49:24.95]Alright.
[49:25.51]So the correct answer is A, Sarah Beth.
[49:28.53]Congratulations, Chet.
[49:29.07]It's actually Sarah Beth.
[49:29.73]It is Sarah Beth, yes.
[49:30.59]It's actually Sarah Beth.
[49:33.06]The apostrophe proved you wrong, unfortunately.
[49:35.50]Okay, well, it's all good.
[49:37.86]Alright, Jack, since you won that round, where are we going?
[49:48.17]I believe... There are no more what is this categories, so stop choosing it.
[49:52.21]Please do not all choose what is that.
[50:00.44]Alright, anime for 1,200.
[50:01.90]I think we have a specific crowd here.
[50:05.70]They do know they're anime.
[50:07.70]Rightfully so.
[50:10.58]What is the name of the cage in The Hidden Mist?
[50:15.57]A, Hokage.
[50:18.59]Hokage?
[50:21.01]I don't even know this answer.
[50:23.07]But I know it's Kage.
[50:25.19]It's Kage and Hokage.
[50:28.92]That one.
[50:32.34]B, rai kage.
[50:36.08]C, mizu kage.
[50:38.73]And D, kaze kage.
[50:40.91]I already said it.
[50:43.11]A. Alright.
[50:44.75]Well, we have your answer, yes.
[50:45.75]But that hurt my hand a little.
[50:48.89]Professor?
[50:49.29]Give me a minute.
[50:53.67]Will do.
[50:58.57]D. D. Kazekage.
[51:03.89]It could be.
[51:05.23]I don't know.
[51:05.79]I think it's Hokage.
[51:07.85]Alright.
[51:08.47]And then we have Chad's answer.
[51:10.78]C, Mizukage.
[51:14.80]Oh.

[51:23.38]I believe it was.
[51:23.98]So what do you have now?
[51:27.10]Was it 9,200?
[51:29.20]10,400 points.
[51:29.90]They have broken the barrier, folks.
[51:31.56]They're in the five digits.
[51:33.69]Alright, congratulations.

[52:17.89]I wonder how many people actually get this.
[52:20.32]Me too.
[52:20.86]In the chat.
[52:21.32]I really am curious.
[52:22.48]Me too.
[52:23.08]Because I think I've told the story like, have I ever told the story ever?
[52:26.78]I don't think I've ever told the story.
[52:31.39]Maybe I have.
[52:34.25]Professor, what do you think about Jervis' life at this point?
[52:36.47]How do you think he got that scar?
[52:37.51]I have a scar on the back of my head.
[52:38.45]Maybe you could take a look at it later.
[52:39.67]Why don't we try thinking too hard?
[52:42.81]I see he's making fun of me.
[52:45.73]He's making fun of me.
[52:46.41]I know he has, like, 132 IQ.
[52:47.99]He's trying to make me look bad.
[52:48.91]That's alright.
[52:49.35]Getting a little heated in here.
[52:51.21]That's okay.

[53:05.25]Karate Kid was one of the most popular movies when I was younger, and my brother kicked me off the bed.
[53:08.69]We were doing it.
[53:09.49]I smashed my head on the back of a fireplace.
[53:11.31]I actually had to get a bunch of staples in my head.
[53:14.85]And I remember it was very, very, very tragic.
[53:19.86]It was horrible, so I remember it for the rest of my life.
[53:21.94]It's Karate Kid.
[53:22.66]That's correct.
[53:23.80]Being Karate Kid.
[53:24.78]That's right.
[53:25.28]Not acting as Karate Kid.
[53:26.70]I mean, like... In that moment, you were Karate Kid.
[53:28.83]I was, like, 11.
[53:31.43]Got it!
[53:32.31]How many points was that worth?
[53:33.11]2,000?
[53:33.13]Why was that worth so much points?
[53:36.83]And Jeremy?
[53:37.93]Okay, so I get to pick now, right?
[53:39.15]Absolutely.
[53:41.21]Why don't we go with... I'm going to stay in there.

[54:04.64]Jeremy, do you know?
[54:07.50]That's really easy to get wrong because it's a four-year span, so it could be
[54:16.38]I hope you're not watching, because I'm probably going to get it wrong.
[54:19.60]I have an idea.
[54:33.90]25% chance of getting it right here.
[54:34.98]There is a 20.
[54:35.66]But it's like, look, OK.
[54:37.60]Let me explain.
[54:38.46]There's a way, when you have a span of like, a lot of people got married during that time.
[54:45.04]I had my brother, my sister, a bunch of friends, and it all happened between like 2009 and 2012.

[55:05.81]You may have been.

[74:13.32]Again, you've got to get on LinkedIn.
[74:16.30]I've seen the response.
[74:17.94]And I have something very special for you today.
[74:21.70]Boys and girls, I've been invited back to do one of my other passions that's not just scary stories.
[74:28.77]It's something else entirely.

[74:59.12]Terrible things.
[75:01.48]Well, the first thing you need to do is you have all of your materials.
[75:05.07]You need clay.
[75:06.03]Balls of clay like this.
[75:09.39]You can get it at a local clay store.
[75:11.29]Make sure it is pottery clay.
[75:14.29]I use the best.
[75:15.94]We're going to slap that right in the center of our pottery here.
[75:22.90]They are so full of demonic energy.
[75:26.71]Oh, I can feel it.
[75:30.69]This has been blessed, and then cursed, and then blessed again, and then cursed three more times.
[75:37.40]I mean, I'd do that too if you need somebody to do that for you.
[75:39.98]If you need somebody to curse your clay, I can do it for you.
[75:42.30]Let's go ahead and get started.
[75:44.22]Now you're probably asking, Bugleberry, what do you use these for?
[75:49.83]Well, you see, I get my friends together.
[75:54.35]And all of us, all of us get together and we make urns for all kinds of purposes.
[76:01.27]And what I'm doing right now is centering the clay.
[76:05.67]That's right.
[76:05.97]You need to get a little bit more water on it, as you see.
[76:10.25]And the thing about clay molding is you need to feel yourself get into it.
[76:15.79]Don't just put your hands on the clay.
[76:18.01]That's not how it works.
[76:20.03]Get into the clay.
[76:22.15]Feel itself in the clay.
[76:24.83]We are making today an urn to keep up.
[76:29.10]Up, up, up.
[76:36.45]Now, when I put my hand up, you want to make sure all of you at home that are following along is to put your hands in as if you are driving a car at ten and two, and then close it very tightly around the crown.
[76:53.50]We are doing this to create a center mass, like I said before, and watch that.
[77:01.73]It gets very hot, especially if you get your play from the underworld like I do.
[77:07.39]Once we have achieved the circle in the center, we're going to move with this part of your hand.
[77:13.33]Use the bone.
[77:14.75]Don't use this part, I'll know.
[77:16.09]Don't use that part.
[77:16.95]That's not the part you're supposed to use.
[77:18.29]You're supposed to use the part of the bone here in between your pinky all the way down to the breastbone.
[77:26.24]And you're simply going to place it here and you're going to put some pressure down to give yourself a nice center.
[77:33.78]Just even pressure down the middle.
[77:37.16]Not too much.
[77:38.62]You should end up a nice flat top like that.
[77:40.81]I have a little bit of an issue on the side.
[77:43.29]You don't have to go full throttle.
[77:44.99]That's my father used to tell me.
[77:46.75]He said, Barry, you're not going to go full throttle.
[77:49.59]And I'd say, fuck you, Dad.
[77:53.14]And then he left.
[77:53.72]I never saw him again.
[77:57.42]So as we sent to the clay,
[78:01.86]We are going to continue to put pressure down into the middle just enough to give us a nice urn shape.
[78:10.18]And it reminds me of a story.
[78:15.07]No, we don't need that today.
[78:21.77]We're just making urns.
[78:26.06]And as I continue, and my feet won't, as I take some of this off the top, as you see.
[78:31.48]I'm going to get really close in here.
[78:34.82]Make sure your clay always needs to be wet.
[78:36.90]Do not ever try to mold clay when it is dry.
[78:40.65]It ain't going to work.
[78:42.21]It's not going to work for you at all.
[78:44.95]Let's go ahead and put our sponge down that you have, and let's even out that center spot.
[79:02.50]Okay, there's a large presence in this part of the moment.
[79:07.46]I can feel it.
[79:08.08]There's something in this room.
[79:14.77]But as I try to... There's a little guy right there.
[79:18.77]What is this?
[79:19.55]What is that?
[79:20.61]What is this?
[79:21.21]What is that?
[79:29.64]What?
[79:37.63]Don't worry, I got him!
[79:45.70]I got him, everybody!
[79:46.96]Oh, ew!
[79:47.74]Ew!
[79:47.96]Oh, yes, it's a spider!
[79:49.18]Oh, ew!
[79:49.48]Oh, ew!
[80:00.06]As we continue, I'm going to start creating an inside portion of this urn.
[80:06.30]I do this with my friends all the time.
[80:07.96]We always get together.
[80:09.48]We create.
[80:11.32]Creation is incredibly important.
[80:16.37]As you see, we have a nice piece here, which I am going to now put my two thumbs down, do this at home, if you will.
[80:24.23]Two thumbs go in, and we let the clay do the work.
[80:29.54]Just let the clay do the work we are trying to make of peace.
[80:35.04]If you need to wet your hands again, absolutely do so!
[80:39.72]I'm not moving at all, the clay is doing all the work.
[80:44.31]Simply going down deeper and deeper into the hellish, mind-destructing portion of the clay.
[80:55.42]You see here, if you've got some scraps, get yourself a bucket and put it in there.
[81:01.99]It's hard to squeeze sometimes, because I can feel the presence of the demon.
[81:07.39]But that's okay.
[81:09.24]Oh, Bugleberry!
[81:11.08]Your stories are cool, but... Oh, Bugleberry, you should come back!
[81:14.70]Please come back, Bugleberry, we love you!
[81:16.54]It's alright here.
[81:19.56]As I'm getting deeper down into this place, just letting it do the work for me.
[81:24.71]Do not move during this procedure.
[81:28.17]You could get seriously injured.
[81:30.65]I don't mean seriously, you have to go to the doctor.
[81:35.26]Let's move that piece in the middle.
[81:40.58]We're making a nice tray here.
[81:44.00]Always with wet clay, it's very important that you do that.
[81:48.66]Working all the way down.
[81:52.26]And you see we have a middle portion, let's remove that.
[81:55.76]And don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, no, no, no, no, no, no shortcuts here.
[82:13.29]What's that?
[82:13.65]I want that!
[82:14.05]Let's go and look at that!
[82:15.07]That's a big one!
[82:18.02]That's a huge one!
[82:21.63]That guy, can we get a nice zoom in on this?
[82:26.47]Can we get a zoom in on him?
[82:30.04]That's a big one.
[82:38.02]I'm sorry.
[82:40.50]Just seemed appropriate.
[82:41.44]Let's go ahead and get deep under here.
[82:52.09]Okay, let's remove the middle portion.
[82:57.86]And only use this for touching up your piece.
[83:02.34]I'm putting gentle pressure down.
[83:04.38]Ah, there I fucked it up.
[83:05.30]I fucked it up.
[83:07.60]You pay attention to this portion of the clay.
[83:11.10]Great.
[83:13.18]I'm just letting it do what it needs to do, smoothing out the center piece.
[83:19.61]And it is delicious.
[83:24.04]Yeah, we are.
[83:26.30]Like I said, once every two weeks, me and all of my friends, we get together and we do this.
[83:33.99]And we do it to a point where all of us can present.
[83:36.95]And it's not about winning, that's the thing.
[83:38.69]It's not about winning.
[83:40.55]Oh, I didn't win.
[83:41.67]No, who cares if you won or not?
[83:44.38]It's about creating.
[83:46.80]And that's it.
[83:49.41]That looks pretty good.
[83:50.53]We have a nice little piece in the middle.
[83:52.05]I can remove that.
[83:53.91]Oops-a-daisy.
[83:55.50]And then into a spare box.
[83:58.26]A little bit more.
[83:58.98]And now I will start to shape up, then.
[84:03.04]With Two Fingers down the bottom.
[84:06.72]Which will allow me to then pull up from the sides.
[84:09.77]Ah, beautiful, then.
[84:12.79]Storing whatever you want in here.
[84:14.47]It could be cigarettes.
[84:15.65]It could be cigars.
[84:20.77]If you have cigarettes, you can go in here.
[84:25.12]And remember, it's about constant pressure.
[84:30.31]It doesn't need to be perfect.
[84:32.89]Oh, Bugleberry, I tried to put together something and it didn't turn out perfectly.
[84:37.54]That's fine.
[84:38.96]As long as the essence of death flows through you into the urn, that's all you will need.
[84:47.54]Now, as you see, finishing the urn requires a new ancient joke.
[84:56.10]Sorry about that, folks.
[84:57.36]Finishing the urn requires nuance because, as you see, I have two... I have a lid here inside the center, and that's for display only.
[85:08.07]Now touch it.
[85:12.43]Go ahead and go in here.
[85:15.63]The lid is very difficult, and you can't make the lid until this portion is completed.
[85:29.43]It tastes like eggs, weirdly enough, but it's something I enjoy.
[85:35.65]And don't tell me what I'm doing is wrong.
[85:37.61]Don't tell me you should not be creating these things.
[85:42.59]You shouldn't be making these things.
[85:44.61]Do you know what day it is today?
[85:48.72]It's Thursday.
[85:50.46]All of your parking tickets expire today.
[85:53.30]Pay them.
[85:54.90]You're gonna get in trouble.
[85:57.96]So as you see here, I have finally crafted an urn that is full of the God-scarce, darling.
[86:06.01]We'll make a lid after I fix this top portion.
[86:11.76]It is so, so beautiful.
[86:14.30]And if you put your finger down here at this point, and just rest it on the edge.
[86:21.32]Don't push down here, you will ruin the lid you created.
[86:28.31]I'm not moving my hand, I'm just making it round in a circle.
[86:34.93]And there we have it.
[86:36.85]Slightly, the edge is turned up a little, but that's okay, because it doesn't, it needs to be just elegant.
[86:45.42]And elegance can come from destruction, it can come from chaos.
[86:49.78]This is the rising wave of clay.
[86:52.72]I suggest to keep it that way.
[86:54.04]Now if I could just...
[87:14.74]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[87:17.20]Did you hear it?
[87:19.08]Did you hear it?
[87:22.22]Sounded like a spirit was flying through.
[87:25.82]If I could only catch him.
[87:27.70]Oh, if I could catch that spirit, he would be in a bad spot.
[87:33.84]For the lid.
[87:35.86]What we need to do for the lid is just very simply, we have another piece of clay we'll be using.
[87:40.96]Let me put this in here somewhere.
[87:46.03]I have two pieces that I will be making for you.
[87:48.85]One is the top and the other is the bottom.
[87:50.99]This is the bottom, which will allow you to... Hello.
[88:00.11]What's the matter?
[88:01.16]What are you... Hold on, he's bitten somebody?
[88:05.12]Did he actually bite somebody?
[88:08.12]Okay, he's eating raw hamburger meat backstage.
[88:16.73]Look, he doesn't get out of the house very much, he doesn't get out very much.
[88:21.04]But Chromeface is very, very, he's not harmful, he's... Is he alright?
[88:26.72]It's alright, it's okay.
[88:27.46]Is it a problem?
[88:28.06]Do you need me to go get him?
[88:28.98]Maybe.
[88:29.10]Maybe you should check on him.
[88:32.60]But I, I thought, I wondered... Is anybody injured?
[88:39.06]Oh, God.
[88:39.82]Okay, well, just put some hamburger meat on the ground.
[88:45.75]I'll go get it.
[88:46.55]Just put it in a trail over 200.
[88:48.23]You know the traps that they make in Looney Tunes?
[88:51.49]You know, the stick that falls down?
[88:53.09]I'll get it.
[88:54.63]Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I have to be cut short because Crownface is...
[89:03.12]It's been a little, a little difficult.
[89:04.70]Of course it is.
[89:06.46]It hasn't been out in about 15 years, son of a bitch.
[89:11.28]I will be back!
[89:12.02]You don't think you'll never see me again?
[89:14.82]You'll see me again!
[89:15.86]God, it couldn't have been so stupid.
[89:23.34]I should have brought out all those rats.
[89:29.76]It would have been better.
[89:30.68]Which one is it?
[92:02.22]you oh
[92:29.31]you
[98:02.06]Thank you.
[101:03.29]Hey, hello, how are you?
[101:04.68]Well, let me fix my hat a little.
[101:06.80]Hi, welcome back.
[101:08.82]We're currently set up right now for the actual main event portion of the stream, which takes actually a little longer than you would think, right?
[101:17.16]I'll explain what's gonna happen here.
[101:18.80]I am currently, for what I'm gonna do on the computer, because we're trying to figure this out, like, oh, what the hell are you even gonna do?
[101:27.63]We have a couple of things that I'm gonna do for the actions.
[101:30.79]But if you're just watching for the first time ever,
[101:33.64]Right now, well, not right now, but when the round starts, you know.
[101:37.65]Over the last, like, three weeks, there has been at least 300 or 400 actions that the community has come up with to try to slime me on this broadcast.
[101:50.47]We have a couple of angles, as we see.
[101:52.79]And over the course of the next probably 40 to 50 minutes to an hour, we're going to see if I do any of those actions.
[101:59.63]I do not know what any of these things are.
[102:02.41]I have no idea.
[102:03.53]I have not been briefed.
[102:04.61]No one has told me, oh, Jeremy, by the way, the action is, say, look at me.
[102:08.45]That's like action number one.
[102:09.77]I have no idea.
[102:10.69]Hopefully that's not action one, because I just did it.
[102:14.48]But also at the same time, while I am doing this, you also are going to be judged, because there are actions that if you do them during these rounds without you knowing, you will lose points, the points that we banked from over there.
[102:30.25]By the way, Bugleberry was $800.
[102:31.85]Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[102:36.52]It's the worst $800 I've ever spent, and I absolutely will spend it again next year.
[102:41.62]So how this works again, each round we're going to have a series of actions.
[102:47.10]When those actions happen, if I do one, I have kind of a death trap up here that is going to slime me if I do it during the round.
[102:56.20]You will be aware of those actions.
[102:57.84]I will not.
[102:59.66]Who knows?
[103:00.22]We're going to keep score.
[103:01.20]If I get slimed, I lose points.
[103:02.88]If you say a word that you're not supposed to say, you lose points, too.
[103:08.04]And we're going to keep track of them.
[103:09.64]You may even get banned, too.
[103:12.51]Like that.
[103:12.89]That's probably not going to happen.
[103:14.65]So the game that I'm going to be playing is Plants vs. Zombies.
[103:20.27]Because that was like the most easy thing to play.
[103:23.56]Because it was like, oh, what are we going to play?
[103:25.86]Oh, I could play a horror game.
[103:27.00]I played them all.
[103:28.26]I could play like a shooter game.
[103:29.94]I played them all.
[103:31.34]I could play a, I don't know.
[103:34.44]We've done them all, right?
[103:35.41]So we've done them all.
[103:36.31]So I'm going to play Plants vs. Zombies while we do this.
[103:40.07]And when do we start?
[103:44.85]Oh, look at that.
[103:45.57]You can see it.
[103:46.92]That's coming at me.
[103:48.12]That's coming for me.
[103:49.76]That is trying to kill me.
[103:51.38]Don't you understand?
[103:52.94]You thought this was all bullshit.
[103:54.20]You thought this was a joke.
[103:55.71]No, we don't do jokes on this stream.
[103:58.13]We do real, real stuff.
[104:01.84]It's actually kind of menacing.
[104:04.05]And there is slime in there, yes.
[104:06.39]So I have like a thing.
[104:09.17]Can we see Plants vs. Zombies?
[104:11.23]Oh, we're gripping gameplay.
[104:12.63]We're going to play Plants vs. Zombies.
[104:16.07]Oh, look at that.
[104:16.55]It's the tutorial level.
[104:17.81]This is great.
[104:20.13]We're recharging.
[104:21.39]OK, so when do we start a round?
[104:23.93]Do we have any idea?
[104:25.81]Are we going to get started, or should I just play Plants vs. Zombies for like two hours?
[104:33.20]How am I losing in the tutorial?
[104:35.44]Is that one of them?
[104:36.14]That's not the first one, right?
[104:37.00]Make sure that's not the first one.
[104:39.41]I actually am losing in the tutorial.
[104:45.77]So then we have, the points should come up on screen.
[104:48.33]Do we have points?
[104:52.89]No, not yet.
[104:53.63]I can't even hear this audio.
[105:01.97]So instead of secret slime action, hey, I'm just like a weird guy in the lower corner of your screen playing Plants vs. Zombies.
[105:09.91]Oh, I gotta bomb that guy!
[105:11.09]Imagine waiting for this dream and it's just like, nah.
[105:17.54]Nah, this is what we're gonna do.
[105:18.62]I'm just gonna play Plants vs. Zombies.
[105:23.70]That is what we're doing.
[105:26.93]Let's see how fast I can click it.
[105:30.33]This is the real time killing.
[105:31.73]See if I can break the record.
[105:34.93]You know, I should just do that right now while we fix the technical problems that are going on.
[105:41.03]I should just click as fast as I can.
[105:44.09]I actually can't even see chat, so I have no idea what they're saying.
[105:47.51]They could be saying anything right now.
[105:50.14]Well, the guy in the Halloween costume.
[105:52.66]I'm not even in a Halloween costume.
[105:59.06]OH SHIT HE'S NOT A HAL- DROP IT OUT OF IT, HE'S NOT IN A Halloween COSTUME!
[106:04.68]There actually are like 400 things that if I do them, then I'll be in a lot of trouble.
[106:11.43]We came back from the break just because it was like, you know what, just put me live.
[106:14.39]Do it.
[106:16.63]Oh, what happened to my earphone?
[106:17.49]I have like one of those Secret Service things.
[106:21.19]Actually losing in the tutorial, I know that's what you're saying, and it's true.
[106:24.26]I actually just lost in the tutorial.
[106:31.88]I lost in the tutorial.
[106:33.08]No!
[106:39.04]Well, shit.
[106:42.72]I'm gonna try it again.
[106:49.68]Whoops.
[106:52.80]I was just, alright, you put the sunflowers down.
[106:56.45]And then when the sunflowers, okay, take the sunflower, 25, 50, I remember, I know how this, your whole back row is sunflowers.
[107:04.06]And then the next row is the pea shooters, right?
[107:10.42]We got doctor, doctor!
[107:12.38]Dr. Sparks, are you still in the house?
[107:14.60]I think I need my blood pressure taken.
[107:15.94]So how are we doing?
[107:20.51]Are we any closer?
[107:24.35]Are we any closer to slime time?
[107:29.69]Or should I lose at the tutorial again?
[107:31.83]He's pretending to lose.
[107:42.02]How many times can I win?
[107:43.34]I know.
[107:44.04]I haven't played... This is actually a pretty good game.
[107:46.59]The second one's stupid.
[107:48.35]But this one is actually really good.
[107:53.07]Just dunk him!
[107:53.77]Dunk him now!
[107:56.05]We're stalling!
[107:59.31]Am I actually... This is what you do, right?
[108:06.14]Right?
[108:08.00]That works.
[108:08.36]I think this works.
[108:16.91]Let me just get a full row.
[108:22.35]Guy playing Plants vs. Zombies.
[108:26.34]I baited you all.
[108:27.28]I baited you all here.
[108:28.20]We started with that trivia round.
[108:31.26]Bugleberry was here.
[108:32.16]Now, hey.
[108:33.42]Settle.
[108:35.46]I'm just going to lean back and play Plants vs. Zombies 1.
[108:39.82]This is riveting.
[108:45.82]The funny thing is, there's probably some of you here that are like, this is great.
[108:49.92]Just keep doing this.
[108:51.36]Just do this for another six hours.
[108:54.29]Alright, fine.
[108:56.77]Whatever, we will.
[108:58.93]Definitely not six hours.
[109:00.09]I'm getting caught.
[109:03.37]How do you win?
[109:03.88]You just have to wait until it's over, right?
[109:08.04]Like that.
[109:16.02]So how are we looking?
[109:16.62]What did you say?
[109:22.80]Secret Service, what did you say?
[109:28.31]Oh, I've lost communication.
[109:31.27]I've lost communication with the back team.
[109:36.07]Wait, we're going?
[109:38.07]Wait, we're going now?
[109:40.45]Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[109:41.55]We're going right now.
[109:43.51]How long have they been there for?
[109:46.05]What?!
[109:47.77]I thought I was still, like, filling time!
[109:49.63]Oh, now you freaked me the fuck out.
[109:52.11]Now, like, I'm scared.
[109:55.19]Wait, everything's ready.
[109:57.87]What?
[109:59.09]I thought I was, like, filling time still.
[110:02.03]Okay, so that means I'm armed.
[110:11.28]Uh... Okay.
[110:16.65]Let me put a back row sub-problem first of all.
[110:20.47]My back is killing me.
[110:21.75]Let me just like... My back is just absolutely killing me.
[110:28.83]You ever get like a tense back?
[110:29.99]I mean, seriously, that's how you get like a bad back.
[110:44.59]That's how you get a bad back, you sit too long.
[110:46.73]I was sitting for too long, that's my problem.
[110:52.00]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I gotta watch out down here.
[110:54.98]So wait, I have actions too.
[111:02.06]Alright, well, I'm sitting there just like, well, who knows if we're starting or not.
[111:08.37]I hope I don't lose.
[111:15.69]Oh, I got to put the onion there.
[111:16.87]If I put the onion there, I win.
[111:20.19]It's a walnut.
[111:21.28]I know what it is.
[111:22.46]Oh, shit.
[111:22.94]Wait.
[111:24.80]Okay, I got one lawn mower down.
[111:29.82]The thing is, I'm trying... Alright, don't touch any... What if I don't touch anything?
[111:35.18]How long is the round?
[111:38.38]How much time do I have in round to, like, worry about this?
[111:47.64]That makes it even worse not knowing because I am completely in the dark I almost just dropped it.
[112:03.20]I almost just dropped it
[112:19.26]Yes!
[112:27.31]Cherry Bomb!
[112:28.61]This is only the best gameplay you're gonna watch on Twitch of Plants vs. Zombies 1.
[112:34.81]We can talk about a quick story about how Plants vs. Zombies 2 took this formula and then they turned it into a...
[112:46.37]a pay-to-win game that really nobody cares about now.
[112:50.23]It's funny, it's weird.
[112:51.15]People come back to this game and they talk about how this is like, oh, what a fantastic, awesome game this is.
[112:57.21]And the second one is just, I don't think anybody's ever played it.
[113:00.75]Only, like... Why is this moving?
[113:05.83]What did I do?
[113:06.37]What did I do?
[113:07.93]It started to... Alright, this thing started to move, so I'm going to stop talking about that.
[113:12.96]I heard, like...
[113:29.20]I don't know what to say.
[113:31.14]When you, when you have like nothing you're allowed to say, you have no words to say.
[113:37.59]I could, I could just like say, I don't know.
[113:41.17]I don't know, I'm scared.
[113:43.11]You guys, okay.
[113:44.86]You just have, oh there are points.
[113:48.46]There are the points.
[113:49.62]I can see them.
[113:51.20]You guys have, where do you guys have 16,000 points from?
[114:03.62]This game's good.
[114:05.82]I'm trying to think of something more action-packed.
[114:09.86]Imagine one of the actions is Play Plants vs. Zombies 1.
[114:17.35]No, touching the nose might be one of them.
[114:19.07]I ain't gonna do it.
[114:21.57]Alright, a huge wave is approaching.
[114:26.05]But from what direction?
[114:27.19]East?
[114:27.63]West?
[114:33.12]How do you get more?
[114:42.02]No, I have to actually set this up, don't I?
[114:43.72]Alright, I gotta be careful, because every time I get... If I get slimed, then I lose, like... How many points do I lose if I get slimed?
[114:56.73]500.
[114:57.65]That's not good.
[114:58.51]Well, it's probably not gonna happen, so that's fine.
[115:02.00]I'll just be quiet the whole time and just actually play this game.
[115:07.93]That's what we're doing!
[115:08.99]I have a lot of money.
[115:19.38]So when's the round end?
[115:38.35]Wings, name of the name's Crazy Dave.
[115:41.05]First I need you to clear your lawn.
[115:44.65]Oh, click to remove it, wow.
[115:50.62]This is, I love Plants vs. Zombies.
[115:54.00]Now we're going bowling.
[115:55.38]I should just like dance on camera.
[116:04.43]Just dance in action.
[116:05.48]Oh, it's in the left.
[116:09.20]Right, right, right.
[116:10.00]Oh, it's bowling.
[116:11.14]Okay.
[116:15.06]I would laugh my fucking ass off if this just didn't happen one time.
[116:21.62]If this doesn't happen once, I will fucking laugh.
[116:26.63]Hey, we set all this up and it died.
[116:29.07]Nope, not gonna happen.
[116:31.37]Not gonna happen one time.
[116:36.72]This is the big explosion one, right?
[116:39.56]Oh, by the way.
[116:40.34]I've got some cool clothes on.
[116:42.60]How was your guys' Halloween?
[116:44.84]How was your guys' day?
[116:45.94]Did you guys have a good day?
[116:52.54]My day was good.
[117:09.85]I did all this.
[117:12.37]I set all this up for the crew.
[117:14.93]And it was really good.
[117:21.20]Do you guys remember when conventions, when people would wear these to conventions?
[117:24.50]It was a huge thing.
[117:25.24]Why would they not make a Planes vs. Zombies 3?
[117:29.08]Everybody loves this franchise.
[117:30.29]This is gonna make a mobile game and that's it?
[117:32.19]Make a 3.
[117:33.23]Make it a real game.
[117:41.08]Oh, it ricochets, right.
[117:48.42]Got it.
[117:48.70]You gotta try to get free.
[117:50.96]Here we are.
[117:51.68]Why did I just do that?
[117:53.39]That was stupid.
[117:54.47]I gotta hit this guy.
[117:56.81]Alright, final wave.
[118:13.28]Everybody has the cones.
[118:14.80]I remember being at PAX East in like 2012, and they would just be cones.
[118:20.20]I'm gonna win this.
[118:23.03]I'm definitely gonna win.
[118:35.32]Alright, if it's not like, oh, touch your nose, touch your face, look out, whoa, what happened to you?
[118:39.54]Oh, watch out for his bum, watch out for his bum.
[118:41.96]I am safe, I think, for this whole round.
[118:49.21]There's like, yeah, call this round.
[118:51.63]It's over, I win.
[118:52.91]They didn't get shit.
[118:58.77]Hey, what was your word, by the way?
[119:04.07]Their word was diaper.
[119:06.64]Your word was diaper.
[119:08.42]How did you do?
[119:13.46]Minus 840 of you said the word diaper.
[119:18.64]That means you lose.
[119:19.70]That means you lose 800 points, because one person's worth one point.
[119:32.19]Nothing happened to me, I'm fine right now.
[119:37.95]It was probably something really specific.
[119:40.69]It was probably like, talk about Gerbercraft.
[119:45.15]Actually, I probably shouldn't say that word.
[119:51.24]So, are we officially on the second round?
[119:55.58]We're coming.
[119:57.26]Okay.
[119:58.44]In five seconds, we will go on the next round.
[120:07.58]I thought it was going to be way more than 800.
[120:11.20]That means I actually cannot get one.
[120:25.46]How many people are here?
[120:29.68]How many people are watching the stream right now?
[120:32.60]Alright, so out of 7,400 people, only 800 of you... I'm wearing a fucking diaper on screen.
[120:39.00]How did you hold... You could contain that.
[120:41.33]You could contain yourselves during that?
[120:45.07]I don't know how that's possible.
[120:48.79]Wait, is the word still banned in the chat?
[120:51.07]No, it's not.
[120:52.70]Okay, thank God.
[120:53.30]I unbanned it.
[120:54.68]I thought it was still banned.
[120:55.56]It was banned for like two months.
[120:58.28]So we're on round two, right?
[121:08.74]So this is new actions, right?
[121:10.72]Not the old ones?
[121:11.34]Or are you compounding them?
[121:15.47]Alright, so... Alright, put my hands down.
[121:26.69]I'm gonna put my hands down.
[121:31.34]That means you guys have a new thing too.
[121:33.46]It's not just me, it's you too.
[121:36.45]Watch what you say for the next little bit.
[121:41.75]Be careful.
[121:42.97]My head is fucking really itchy.
[121:47.17]I don't know what it is.
[121:57.45]Something about my hair is just fucking bothering me.
[122:01.24]It's super itchy right now.
[122:09.87]There's something about it.
[122:10.51]I don't know what it is.
[122:14.69]Maybe it has to do with the fact that they're right.
[122:18.42]What are you doing?
[122:19.42]What did I do?
[122:19.88]What did I do?
[122:20.40]What did I do?
[122:20.88]What did I do?
[122:21.74]What did I do?
[122:22.70]What?
[122:23.80]What did I do?
[122:24.44]What?
[122:28.00]What did I do?
[122:33.22]What was the action?
[122:36.74]I touched my hair?
[122:39.36]I touched my hair twice was the action.
[122:44.92]Well, how many fucking people said I had... Oh, for the love of God.
[122:53.83]Did I just, how many points?
[122:55.17]500 points?
[122:55.43]How am I gonna play?
[123:00.81]We didn't think this through.
[123:02.62]We didn't think this through.
[123:03.44]How am I gonna play?
[123:05.16]I can't play the game.
[123:07.72]I can't do anything.
[123:11.84]My fucking hand cannot come back down here.
[123:15.34]Touch your hair twice.
[123:18.66]Oh, for the love of God, this stuff stinks by the way.
[123:23.85]This smells so bad.
[123:25.55]Is that it?
[123:26.59]Can we go to the next round?
[123:27.57]Oh, we keep going.
[123:30.11]I need to play with my left hand.
[123:39.63]I just got a towel.
[123:43.49]What happened to my eye?
[123:48.73]This smells like baby puke.
[123:51.05]I don't know why I know that.
[123:52.35]It just smells like baby puke.
[123:58.18]Am I losing it in the game?
[124:00.04]I'm not even paying attention.
[124:01.10]Alright, I need to... Okay.
[124:06.48]We're good.
[124:07.20]Everything's fine.
[124:09.30]Touch your fucking hair twice.
[124:13.48]The thing is, I heard, I heard like the crank.
[124:17.26]And that's when I was like, what the fuck happened?
[124:19.88]What's the score?
[124:20.42]11, what is it?
[124:21.98]11 what? 1100.
[124:26.87]Okay, I didn't lose.
[124:28.87]I won, actually.
[124:29.39]That's good.
[124:30.13]The thing... This is gonna be horrible.
[124:33.65]Honestly, I'm not kidding around.
[124:35.23]After one?
[124:36.25]Huh.
[124:37.07]Cool.
[124:38.01]Let's not ever do that again, because now, like, I feel like shit.
[124:44.48]Hold on, let me fill this back up.
[124:45.84]Are we still on that same round?
[124:48.26]Okay.
[124:55.72]Good thing I'm wearing a diaper.
[124:58.78]Alright, I got the ice, Snoopy.
[125:01.88]So.
[125:06.34]Jesus Christ.
[125:14.82]Don't touch my face, right?
[125:16.01]Oh, touch my hair?
[125:16.65]Should I not touch anything?
[125:18.03]But what if I have to rub my face because there's slime in my eyes?
[125:20.39]Alright.
[125:31.81]How does it look?
[125:35.51]This shit's not done- This is not even orange.
[125:40.13]It's like, fucking... It's like- It's like white.
[125:45.86]It's supposed to be orange.
[125:47.26]But I don't think- It doesn't- Is it cause of the light?
[125:50.82]I can't tell.
[125:54.12]It looks like it's like, pale.
[125:55.74]Should've been a green, that would've been better.
[126:15.62]It's hardening in my, like, ear canal.
[126:19.38]Hey, welcome to the, hey, welcome everybody to the stream!
[126:22.08]Jesus fucking Christ.
[126:35.45]I gotta, I, oh, alright.
[126:36.73]What do they have, okay, can you pump into me what they have for action?
[126:43.41]So this round is over.
[126:48.29]The word was bald, by the way.
[126:50.41]But apparently in doing so, I had to touch my head twice, which is technically my hair, but it's not really my hair, so that's a technicality.
[126:56.10]I don't believe that should be allowed.
[126:57.76]Do you guys have a timer up?
[127:03.06]We're just going by.
[127:03.80]No, I can see the chat.
[127:09.15]Why is everybody saying he said orange?
[127:17.59]What do you mean, what are you talking about?
[127:19.11]He just said it.
[127:23.57]Orange is one of the worst.
[127:33.38]Somebody just shit in my pants.
[127:39.16]Somebody shit in my pants.
[127:40.84]I didn't do it, but somebody else very clearly did.
[127:43.73]Holy shit.
[127:50.46]The word was orange?
[127:53.95]I talked about how this didn't look orange.
[128:03.77]Can we watch a movie or something?
[128:06.15]Because I can't even touch the screen.
[128:09.54]I can't touch anything.
[128:13.08]Are we on a new round?
[128:16.50]I just got an achievement.
[128:19.46]Let's watch Rat Movie.
[128:22.38]No, that's probably an action.
[128:23.48]Actually, it's gonna happen with playing Plants vs. Zombies, because there's no way I could've done anything else.
[128:32.79]Oh, dude, what the fuck?
[128:33.45]You should be playing Soma.
[128:35.83]Yeah?
[128:36.53]Should I?
[128:39.03]I'm sticking to the ground.
[128:43.78]Jesus.
[128:49.25]Your hair looks dumb.
[128:57.31]What is that?
[128:58.49]Wait, I didn't do anything.
[128:59.67]Are we on a new round?
[129:02.66]We're on a new round, right?
[129:03.64]I just burped really loudly and hopefully that's not something.
[129:08.68]What am I doing?
[129:09.08]I gotta get rid of this guy.
[129:10.28]It's hard to even grab this guy.
[129:18.87]You guys don't understand, I don't have a mouse pad.
[129:20.85]It's slime here.
[129:21.95]Slime is my mouse pad.
[129:27.04]Really?
[129:28.78]How am I going to do this?
[129:33.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[129:34.15]No, no, no.
[129:34.51]I can't lose.
[129:35.01]I can't lose.
[129:35.37]I can't lose.
[129:35.73]I can't lose.
[129:36.09]I can't lose.
[129:36.41]I can't lose.
[129:36.75]Don't lose.
[129:36.99]Don't lose.
[129:37.27]Don't lose.
[129:37.55]Please don't lose.
[129:38.17]I'm going to lose.
[129:45.40]Look, you don't have to deal with somebody getting slimed.
[129:47.29]I do.
[129:48.13]I have to deal with somebody sliming my ass.
[129:52.85]It's actually in, like, the back of my underwear, and every time I get up and get down, it's like... This is the worst feeling ever.
[129:59.63]What are we slated to do here?
[130:00.82]Like an hour and a half?
[130:02.48]Uh, just kidding.
[130:03.10]More like 25 minutes.
[130:04.98]See you guys next time.
[130:07.74]Cut his mic.
[130:11.00]If I lean over good enough, I can see.
[130:18.50]Alright, so... Here we go.
[130:24.33]New round, new time.
[130:26.39]Let's do it!
[130:26.97]I have to at least win one round.
[130:32.37]Okay.
[130:38.88]How many?
[130:39.36]Okay, so it's ten.
[130:40.42]What is it?
[130:40.88]Ten?
[130:41.26]What is it?
[130:42.16]I can't see it from here.
[130:45.28]Ten what?
[130:46.44]We're on a new round, right?
[130:51.49]actually new actions right now?
[130:54.47]People are spamming, show the actions, show actions.
[130:56.46]I don't even know what they are.
[130:59.54]Oh, new actions are going up now.
[131:01.42]I think I'm just playing Plants vs. Zombies.
[131:03.70]I think.
[131:08.30]Show actions, show actions, show actions.
[131:09.94]Alright, hold.
[131:11.79]Are they up?
[131:12.61]Okay.
[131:28.22]A mine.
[131:31.10]How long does the arm take to mine?
[131:36.82]20 seconds?
[131:44.86]25?
[131:51.32]This is so unnerving.
[131:53.40]Cause I just hear like production people like going like this.
[131:56.36]I hear them like,
[131:59.20]They're like moving around back there.
[132:05.22]All that happens is you guys lose points.
[132:07.16]What happens to me is somebody goes to the bathroom in the back of my underwear.
[132:11.17]That's what happens to me.
[132:15.35]I'd rather have it hit me in the face.
[132:21.11]Seriously.
[132:30.72]I have to win this one.
[132:36.70]It's starting to harden.
[132:38.37]Alright, I need to take care of this guy.
[132:47.81]Okay, look at how covered I am in shit, right?
[132:52.10]I am from like up to down.
[132:54.07]Let's get you a towel.
[132:56.43]Let's get you a towel.
[132:58.43]This is like a face cloth.
[133:28.87]Don't lose again.
[133:30.31]The gameplay is what matters on this stream.
[133:34.12]Nothing else matters.
[133:35.02]Only the video game is being shown.
[133:38.64]What's going on?
[133:40.48]What's wrong with the computer?
[133:41.70]The computer just blue screened.
[133:44.88]Wait.
[133:45.16]Oh, wait.
[133:45.70]The computer blue screened.
[133:47.72]What?
[133:48.74]Oh, shit.
[133:50.04]That's an action.
[133:51.72]That's an action for the computer.
[133:53.52]Oh, god damn it.
[133:55.44]Oh, what the fuck?
[133:58.63]How was I?
[134:02.53]What's going on here?
[134:09.79]It's smoking.
[134:11.67]The computer's smoking from the back.
[134:17.99]The computer's smoking.
[134:24.46]How many points does the computer lose?
[134:29.52]How many points did the computer have?
[134:33.72]Is it alright?
[134:36.12]Somebody reboot it.
[134:36.82]Can you reboot it?
[134:39.25]If you hit Control-Alt-Delete on it, see if it works.
[134:41.73]Let's see.
[134:49.71]No.
[134:50.61]I'm not getting anything from this PC.
[134:54.20]Should I blow on it?
[134:58.88]Um.
[135:01.91]Damn.
[135:07.91]What do we do?
[135:12.92]Because that's actually like, this thing's dead.
[135:17.00]I'll have my iPad.
[135:18.74]Do you want me to bring home my iPad?
[135:21.90]I'll get my iPad.
[135:24.36]We can play something on the iPad for a while.
[136:00.91]so
[136:22.98]you
[138:28.58]you
[140:35.96]Thank you.
[142:17.71]Hi, I'm Jerma.
[142:20.53]And now we're gonna play iPad games, because that's what we have.
[142:26.78]Yeah, it's not just you and me, it's the computer as well is involved in this.
[142:30.84]This is actually caking, it's an iPad stream, as it is.
[142:34.32]You didn't think we were gonna come back to this, but we always do.
[142:37.32]So where do we stand on points?
[142:39.81]I am currently losing, because I went to the bathroom during the trivia.
[142:48.77]I had a long piss.
[142:49.69]It was about four minutes.
[142:51.55]But we have right here in our hands Halloween-themed horror games.
[143:00.34]And we are going to start with one called Spirit Oracle Board.
[143:04.54]If you don't have TikTok, now's the time to get it.
[143:11.22]There are ads on this.
[143:12.21]I'm going to do it.
[143:15.66]The scary stories, I'm not gonna click that.
[143:17.50]It's gonna open up like a webpage.
[143:18.63]Alright, start the seance.
[143:20.39]Okay, we got a full page TikTok ad.
[143:28.85]Okay, instructions.
[143:30.57]Can we get some ambience in here?
[143:33.07]If possible, darken the room.
[143:35.39]You are in and light some candles before starting a seance.
[143:42.09]Place your finger on the planchette, is that the term?
[143:47.94]The wooden piece in order to initiate the spiritual connection to the other side.
[143:53.02]Ask the spirit your question loud and clear.
[143:55.84]Always start a seance with a question, is anyone there?
[143:59.59]Wait for the spirit, this is a lot of, this is a huge amount of questions.
[144:05.63]There's a huge amount of instructions here, not questions.
[144:09.83]Wait for the spirit to respond, the planchette will start moving, okay.
[144:13.05]Always be polite and ask normal questions.
[144:15.59]This is a way to make it so kids don't say anything bad, right?
[144:18.70]Don't say anything mean, don't say fuck.
[144:21.80]Be careful not to upset any spirit.
[144:25.66]I've seen a couple running around here today, actually.
[144:28.56]In case you have angered a spirit, quickly move the planchette to goodbye before the countdown is over or unexplained things might happen, sure.
[144:37.02]Speech recognition required.
[144:43.12]Do we actually have to do this?
[144:44.97]Do I have to do, do I have to allow speech recognition?
[144:49.83]I don't want this like, you talk, you can always change this later, okay, so I allow access, right?
[144:57.45]Are we good?
[144:57.89]Spirit Ward would like to access speech recognition, okay.
[145:05.24]Why does it need to know all this stuff?
[145:07.99]Listen to your microphone, okay.
[145:11.31]Turbo seance.
[145:15.77]Unlock these special features.
[145:18.33]Turbo seance.
[145:20.53]Messages will, no, no thank you.
[145:22.49]I don't think I need to do the turbo seance.
[145:24.35]Place fingers on the planchette to start.
[145:26.46]Do we have any scary music going here?
[145:28.92]We do, okay.
[145:31.18]Place finger on planchette to start, you've got it.
[145:35.18]Ask.
[145:42.47]Do you, are there any spirits here?
[145:45.27]Are there any spirits here?
[145:48.22]Are there any spirits here?
[146:18.33]Are there any spirits here?
[146:24.90]Wait a minute.
[146:26.62]Oh, shit.
[146:27.68]You're going to see me doing this.
[146:29.85]Never mind.
[146:33.65]This thing sucks.
[146:34.73]What?
[146:36.29]Hello.
[146:41.46]Let's try it again.
[146:42.40]Warning, seance in progress.
[146:44.00]If you've made contact with a spirit, you should end the seance by moving to the goodbye.
[146:48.92]Exit.
[146:54.93]I love how you, I love how you cut that.
[146:58.15]I saw you go.
[147:01.19]But look, no, no, no, come back, come back.
[147:02.79]They're doing it.
[147:03.65]They're doing it, look.
[147:05.47]That's like G. Oh no, so you got the bomb.
[147:09.87]Oh, shoot.
[147:11.98]Oh, shit.
[147:14.18]What monster is this gonna summon?
[147:16.55]Oh, the rainbow, that means you got five.
[147:20.77]Give me a fucking, no, I don't, no, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[147:24.05]I don't wanna, I'm gonna try this one more time and then move on to the next fucking iPad game, no thanks.
[147:30.25]Place, okay.
[147:34.81]Are you here?
[147:46.04]Does this thing even, does this even do anything?
[147:47.82]Do we know if this is even doing anything?
[147:50.70]I don't think this does anything.
[147:54.74]This is fucking stupid.
[147:56.08]Alright, I'm gonna hit the button and we're gonna do another one because, okay, I'm gonna hit the button.
[148:03.06]That's the end of the round for chat.
[148:06.02]The word, what?
[148:08.96]The word was turbo.
[148:11.38]How many points did they lose?
[148:12.54]Holy shit.
[148:18.28]That's some next level baiting, if I've ever seen it.
[148:23.53]Alright, do I want you to show, okay, this is Granny 2, is this one.
[148:27.07]This is Granny Chapter 2.
[148:39.24]So, do I have new actions?
[148:44.36]I didn't do anything, right?
[148:48.72]Same one.
[148:49.24]Alright, we're going to do normal.
[148:57.81]Granny, play as options.
[149:00.33]That's fine.
[149:01.09]Normal.
[149:02.75]Quality.
[149:03.35]Granny and Grandpa move at normal speed.
[149:05.13]That's fine.
[149:07.28]Be quiet.
[149:07.86]Granny hears everything.
[149:08.98]Grandpa doesn't hear very well, but he hits hard.
[149:14.52]Press and hold the remove button to free yourself from bear traps.
[149:17.80]Hide under beds or in wardrobes.
[149:19.24]You have five days.
[149:20.20]That's a long time.
[149:20.94]Use headphones for best experience.
[149:22.59]I can't do that.
[149:31.09]So how many actions do we have for chat right now?
[149:41.32]Is it like a gyro?
[149:49.81]Oh wow, this is so scary.
[149:56.40]What's the goal here?
[149:58.87]Do I just have to stay away from Granny?
[150:00.97]Why are there spikes in this?
[150:02.09]Wait, if I go in here, is this gonna kill me?
[150:04.83]Is this an Iron Maiden?
[150:10.85]Oh, you can crouch too, alright.
[150:12.49]So what do I do?
[150:13.67]This is Granny Chapter Two, by the way.
[150:16.01]If you don't know, this is the number one downloaded game on the whole App Store.
[150:21.91]I don't know why, Granny is just number one on the, it's just, there's like 700,000 reviews for this game as well.
[150:33.42]Wait a minute, can I open this?
[150:39.04]I just spit on this, but I've had slime up my nose for the last, like, fucking 40 minutes, so it doesn't really matter.
[150:45.59]Oh, I spit!
[150:48.77]Where the hell am I?
[150:52.89]What?
[151:02.89]Is the slime yummy?
[151:03.92]Is that what you're asking?
[151:07.48]Not particularly.
[151:09.36]It just smells like baby formula.
[151:16.36]Is it actually edible?
[151:18.23]I think it is, right?
[151:22.49]No.
[151:23.31]What did I just do that for?
[151:25.43]No, I can't touch this.
[151:29.06]Is the slime yummy?
[151:30.64]Is that a trick question?
[151:33.81]It might be.
[151:35.07]So now I know, don't put the slime in your mouth.
[151:38.01]That's one of the, I know one of the actions now.
[151:41.73]I got a man on the inside.
[151:49.15]The shower tonight that I take is gonna be the best shower I've ever taken in my whole life.
[151:51.81]Alright, what am I supposed to do?
[151:57.35]No, I haven't gotten any in the mouth.
[152:00.09]Because it went back, I've only been slimed twice.
[152:04.66]I've been slimed two times.
[152:07.46]I think I'm good.
[152:08.40]And one of them was bullshit because I had to point to my head twice.
[152:13.82]So I need a key in Granny's house.
[152:17.76]Oh, this game.
[152:19.16]Wait, I can't, can I talk shit about like the most popular game in the app store?
[152:23.05]I probably can't, right?
[152:25.77]Like, can I say like Granny sucks?
[152:28.75]I can't.
[152:29.43]There's like 800,000 people that disagree with me, so I'm wrong, right?
[152:36.51]I don't even know where I'm supposed to be going.
[152:41.95]Back upstairs?
[152:48.17]And what killed me the first time?
[152:53.29]Can I turn the brightness up on the iPad?
[152:56.41]Alright, I'm gonna turn the brightness up.
[153:01.46]It's pretty low, I can't see.
[153:04.74]Alright, now I can see.
[153:06.26]It was really low.
[153:09.76]Now I can see.
[153:10.74]Alright, we're good.
[153:12.17]It was so dark.
[153:15.09]Alright, I'm upstairs.
[153:16.27]Okay, there's... I'm assuming that was Granny.
[153:20.48]There was just people in Granny's house.
[153:24.14]What does he...
[153:36.13]No, like, how do I peel?
[153:38.95]How do you peel?
[153:39.59]I don't have any idea.
[153:42.46]How do you peel?
[153:43.10]Looks like, oh, I'm gonna peel.
[153:45.82]Sure.
[153:47.10]No, don't click the ad, don't click the ad, don't click the ad.
[153:51.13]Alright.
[153:56.54]Well, it's time for me to peel, I guess.
[153:59.22]Let's go, choose my peeler.
[154:01.42]I think that's a good one up here.
[154:03.32]Nope, nope, no, no, no, no.
[154:09.17]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[154:11.45]I'm stuck to the ground.
[154:14.01]When I stand up, we're carving a pumpkin soon.
[154:15.81]Ooh, oh, shh, that might be a, that might be an action.
[154:20.31]That might be, don't say it.
[154:24.04]He's doing a pumpkin carving.
[154:29.85]No, I can't, but we're doing a pumpkin carving after that, after this.
[154:35.49]So, there's more to see.
[154:38.72]I think I'm done playing Granny, so I'm going to move on to the next one, because Granny is pretty, it's just Granny and the other person in the house, and they attack you.
[154:50.06]Okay.
[154:51.53]Good old iPad horror games that I don't know how to accomplish anything in them.
[154:57.22]I also don't have audio.
[154:58.62]That's another thing you guys maybe might not know.
[155:01.64]You guys might not know that.
[155:04.78]I guess I can sneak.
[155:05.58]I'll try one more time.
[155:07.09]Well, that's the death room.
[155:09.52]I probably have like, hold on, let me fix my nerd neck.
[155:11.36]I don't wanna have like nerd neck.
[155:14.42]But how do you, okay, I'm dead again.
[155:15.88]Alright, so Granny is a fun game, and she's a wonderful, wonderful person.
[155:26.12]This five, should I just do all five days?
[155:32.74]I'm gonna go to the next game, because this is just stupid.
[155:36.82]Alright.
[155:37.69]Round over, or are we still going to stay with whatever we have here?
[155:42.55]Let's keep it up for a little bit.
[155:45.25]Keep it up for a little bit on here.
[155:46.85]No, I mean... Oh, because this game sucks.
[155:51.07]Yeah, no, new game.
[155:52.03]Alright, new game.
[155:54.55]How about... Yeah, new action.
[155:55.93]How about Scary Butcher 3D?
[155:57.85]New action's a new game?
[155:58.59]Yeah.
[155:59.81]Alright, how about Scary Butcher 3D?
[156:02.06]That one looks pretty good.
[156:07.82]Play.
[156:09.90]Chat says that you violated one.
[156:10.70]What do you mean a violated one?
[156:14.12]On the last list.
[156:16.20]What do you mean a violated one?
[156:19.74]People saying rigged?
[156:20.56]What do you mean cheated, rigged?
[156:21.72]What are you talking about?
[156:28.80]Hand motion and old man voice.
[156:30.65]What?
[156:30.77]You can't just retroactively add a slime because we didn't do it.
[156:52.09]I just backed up.
[156:54.40]I was like, OK.
[156:56.84]I guess I'll don't put that.
[156:57.82]So what do you mean hand motions?
[157:01.86]One of the triggers was hand motion not related to the game.
[157:08.92]So what?
[157:09.34]Yeah.
[157:14.46]Oh, OK.
[157:14.72]Alright, well, I'm just going to say, OK, I have an idea.
[157:22.46]I have to keep my fucking hands down.
[157:27.90]So in the small town of Erie, there lived a butcher, B, with his wife.
[157:34.96]One stormy night, Elena got, I'm stuck to the back of the chair.
[157:37.96]I'm stuck to the back of the chair.
[157:39.32]Can you see this?
[157:41.18]I'm actually stuck to the back of the chair.
[157:45.35]Who cares about the butcher's life?
[157:48.07]Since then, he cooks all kinds of sausages.
[157:50.43]Who gives a shit about the butcher?
[157:51.45]I'm stuck to the chair.
[158:00.81]Since then, his pets keep vanishing all around.
[158:03.05]I can hear it being refilled and it's seriously causing me a lot of anxiety.
[158:09.51]Since then, the pets keep vanishing all around town.
[158:11.22]Some believe it's the butcher who captures and eats the pets.
[158:13.66]This guy's fucking crazy.
[158:18.34]Okay.
[158:24.16]You know when you watch a cartoon and there's always that like weird part of the cartoon where, or, no, you know, I'll put it this way.
[158:31.74]Men in Black, right?
[158:33.10]I got, and like in every Men in Black movie, I've been eaten by the alien and then spit out.
[158:38.09]You know, like, oh, damn, what the fuck?
[158:41.61]I'm the guy that got eaten and spit out by the alien.
[158:43.47]I think I'm doing pretty well.
[158:47.96]Okay.
[158:51.90]I'm the person that gets regurgitated.
[158:55.04]OK, let's continue.
[158:59.55]Your cat fuzzball went missing yesterday.
[159:01.67]Could be captured by B. The Butcher's Hill is heavily protected by alarms, so you have to be careful.
[159:08.43]This person stole my cat?
[159:13.38]Press button to throw the stone.
[159:18.65]Hold, follow arrows to reach destination.
[159:20.59]What do you mean throw the stone?
[159:22.05]Why did I do that?
[159:22.57]What was the point of that?
[159:26.18]Keep your fucking hands down here.
[159:29.48]No, no, like.
[159:34.24]Download now, promotion.
[159:35.84]Well done, level complete.
[159:36.96]I walked in a straight line.
[159:39.61]It was a close call and I'm still going.
[159:41.63]Okay, it's good that you managed to hide or you could be his next victim.
[159:47.49]Break into beat.
[159:54.88]Doesn't that game look fun?
[159:57.10]Right.
[159:59.86]Cool.
[160:00.50]No, don't watch the whole ad.
[160:04.84]I can't even click the X. OK, stop opening the fucking app store.
[160:09.48]OK, break into B's shed and steal his night vision goggles.
[160:16.44]Use this button to toggle display.
[160:21.00]That's him in the corner.
[160:31.76]Can he not see me?
[160:38.64]Oh, there he is.
[160:40.18]Look out.
[160:40.74]Oh, no, he got you.
[160:41.96]He just goes like, he just like dances.
[160:45.75]Oops, butcher caught you red-handed.
[160:47.47]Restart.
[160:52.17]Here's that shooter game you like, kids.
[160:54.38]This is that shooter game for you kids.
[161:01.52]I can't hit the X. We just have to let it play out.
[161:11.09]Oh, no, no, no.
[161:12.63]It's like actually opening the App Store.
[161:15.11]We have to move on.
[161:15.85]Alright, we're going to do horror clones.
[161:19.54]Are we on a new round?
[161:20.20]Same round?
[161:20.56]New round?
[161:21.10]We're going to keep the same round because we need to move soon.
[161:26.24]OK.
[161:26.34]The iPad is upside down because the game crashed.
[161:28.22]So we're going to pick a different one.
[161:29.36]How about Evil Nun?
[161:33.88]Evil Nun?
[161:35.02]Evil Nun might also be broken, too.
[161:47.57]Evil Nun doesn't work.
[161:49.85]How about Emily?
[161:52.25]How about Emily?
[161:53.07]Do you work, Emily?
[161:57.85]We'll find out.
[161:59.49]Emily wants to play a new game.
[162:01.05]Holy shit, it actually works.
[162:06.09]And what if we're going to get into the ad?
[162:08.35]Oh, of course we are.
[162:09.17]Here it comes.
[162:10.47]No, this actually has a cut scene.
[162:23.82]Did you see that?
[162:27.38]OK.
[162:37.30]This has been fucking stupid.
[162:39.36]The iPad segment was a bust.
[162:43.75]Interact.
[162:46.57]Although I still have that.
[162:47.47]What was Chad's word?
[162:50.19]What did Chad have for a word last time?
[162:52.15]The last word was ass.
[162:54.79]Ass.
[163:01.22]And it was 2,100.
[163:10.02]Okay, well, sorry to hear that you guys lost so many points.
[163:19.99]Why was it ass?
[163:22.97]Ooh, hold on, what's on the computer?
[163:27.21]What's on the computer?
[163:29.46]Let's get a zoom in.
[163:32.86]Thanks for what?
[163:34.80]Thanks for ordering.
[163:39.22]I don't know what I ordered.
[163:40.14]Thanks a lot, okay.
[163:45.92]Can I go on?
[163:52.32]Oh, that's a hint.
[163:57.34]Wait, I can just turn the lights off in the whole house?
[164:01.71]Oh, let's play at midnight, says one guy.
[164:05.27]Sure, I'll try.
[164:10.30]Alright, this game sucks too.
[164:11.52]I'm gonna just carve the pumpkin.
[164:17.92]This game sucks.
[164:20.16]No, it doesn't.
[164:20.68]That's not fair.
[164:21.88]That's not fair.
[164:23.68]It's not fair.
[164:27.88]Let me give it like another 30 seconds.
[164:31.60]Look, tap center to interact with objects.
[164:34.44]This game actually is for an iPad game.
[164:36.77]It's pretty good.
[164:39.34]Let me turn the lights back on.
[164:40.51]Hold on.
[164:41.01]Can I leave the house?
[164:45.93]The slime has caked underneath my head.
[164:50.33]I want to so badly take this off, but I can't because if it happens again, then it... This is real life.
[165:00.37]I want you to get this.
[165:01.41]Look at this.
[165:08.38]It's like glued to my forehead.
[165:11.42]If I take this off and I get slimed again, I will be very upset.
[165:21.33]I ain't taking the bald cap off.
[165:28.91]Does anybody know anything about these games?
[165:33.51]I just heard dump it.
[165:35.93]And why are we dumping it?
[165:40.08]Don't look up into it.
[165:41.08]What do you mean?
[165:41.56]I'm going to get in my eyes.
[165:42.36]Close your eyes.
[165:48.11]Holy shit, this is disgusting.
[165:50.75]You put extra in this one.
[165:57.93]Okay.
[166:01.34]Oh my god, this is vile?
[166:03.50]I'm trying to be normal about this.
[166:08.44]It smells, it smells like acid.
[166:15.12]What?
[166:24.42]Smells like, but.
[166:25.94]That's a real life, that's not over exaggerating.
[166:38.99]No, there's no glue in this.
[166:40.79]This is eco-friendly slime.
[166:42.45]Oh my God.
[166:43.59]I just saw.
[166:47.22]Hey, remember in Men in Black when the guy gets like fucking puked up?
[166:53.20]The guy pukes and he's like, that's me.
[166:55.40]What's that?
[166:56.40]Don't do it, move.
[167:00.52]Mom, if you're watching, I'm sorry.
[167:02.50]I'm sorry, Mom.
[167:03.70]I really don't mean to be like this.
[167:05.84]I have to take this off.
[167:08.14]Where's the pumpkin?
[167:13.90]I still have the diaper on.
[171:23.16]Nice watch.
[171:25.66]Hi, welcome back.
[171:27.78]Welcome.
[171:29.62]Right now, we're going to do a thing.
[171:32.07]We're going to do a thing where I carve a pumpkin.
[171:35.03]By the way, the diaper has to stay on.
[171:37.35]Because if the diaper comes off, the pants do too.
[171:40.59]Because they have weighed down to a point where I have to keep them on.
[171:45.64]I'm making it worse.
[171:51.42]So, as you see here, we have a regular size pumpkin.
[171:56.74]I'm gonna draw a stencil on him.
[172:01.42]I look really bad.
[172:03.66]Really bad.
[172:05.98]In fact, see, like, so, as we see here, I don't know shit about carving pumpkins.
[172:15.71]I'm realizing this right now.
[172:16.59]Oh, what do we wanna do to like, how do you wanna end this like show?
[172:21.14]Okay, I don't know how the fuck to do that.
[172:26.40]So where, what are you doing, what are you doing?
[172:31.43]What'd I do?
[172:31.79]What did I say, the word pumpkin?
[172:36.53]The word pumpkin.
[172:37.83]You're gonna set me up with a segment where I get a pumpkin and I say the word pumpkin and that's a problem.
[172:43.90]So that's not fair.
[172:47.16]How's that fair?
[172:58.88]Okay.
[173:04.08]I can't... The pumpkin is gone?
[173:08.74]I can save a little pumpkin now.
[173:10.50]Okay.
[173:12.76]So I'm going to draw a stencil here.
[173:15.71]Can you see that?
[173:18.55]That's my stencil.
[173:20.59]Okay.
[173:25.29]Okay, there are knives now around.
[173:27.68]There are knives.
[173:28.76]I'm gonna move the knives over here, because these are knives.
[173:35.46]Okay, so.
[173:39.15]You know, why don't I just punch it?
[173:44.19]Okay.
[173:48.31]You guys have no fucking, this is like a challenge on a game show, which is pretty much what this is.
[173:53.81]I'm gonna have to get up with my hands because there's fucking slime everywhere here.
[174:01.76]Hold on.
[174:11.08]So why would you give somebody a knife?
[174:18.14]when they're standing on ice.
[174:20.49]This is a challenge.
[174:29.49]I can't get it in with my nails.
[174:32.65]Okay.
[174:35.12]That's unsafe.
[174:36.34]It's unsafe.
[174:59.34]Alright, we got a vacuum!
[175:21.50]That's not... That's not a... Okay, everyone...
[175:27.12]The word is not vacuum.
[175:28.94]I just don't want to be harmed on stream.
[175:32.12]That's not the word.
[175:35.01]Is it the word?
[175:36.55]No.
[175:37.77]No, it's actually not vacuum.
[175:39.83]That's too bad.
[175:41.73]Oh, that's better.
[175:42.86]That's better.
[175:43.28]Okay.
[175:44.74]Okay.
[176:18.62]Anybody want a pumpkin?
[176:29.10]It's not that I've never carved a pumpkin, I just don't wanna, hold on.
[176:33.00]Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[176:36.99]I'm gonna make, let's go like this.
[176:41.15]Wait a minute!
[176:42.99]The hammer!
[176:43.69]The hammer with the, with the, the hammer!
[176:46.15]Where's the hammer?
[176:47.53]The hammer with the like,
[176:51.03]Literally nobody on production knows what I'm trying to say.
[176:53.44]The hammer with the little nails that light up.
[177:01.08]The chisel.
[177:02.72]I can do that.
[177:15.91]Scary.
[177:17.57]Alright, this works.
[177:19.33]No, I don't have to worry about it.
[177:20.48]I'm gonna make a face.
[177:28.08]Is it a real pumpkin?
[177:29.00]What do you mean, is this a real pumpkin?
[177:33.10]Like this is a real pumpkin.
[177:35.38]Look at the stem.
[177:39.24]I can see, I just have to squint real hard, but I can see what you said.
[177:46.57]The stream's prerecorded.
[177:48.35]Oh, is it?
[177:49.65]Would it be prerecorded if I went like this?
[177:54.50]It's a fake stream.
[177:57.96]Just wait a minute.
[177:58.72]Let me just get this, because I know what your, I know what your, where's the, there it is.
[178:03.89]Let me go.
[178:06.09]Doctor, how am I doing?
[178:07.27]Oh, I'm doing just fine.
[178:17.75]Alright, that works.
[178:21.07]I'm gonna hit my fucking hand with this.
[178:37.48]That, okay, we're getting there.
[178:46.04]I can't even pick it up.
[178:48.23]OK, what if I, hold on, like this?
[178:51.69]I am making something.
[178:54.01]The face I'm going to make is going to be a very special guest.
[179:00.92]You might find this thing at the circus.
[179:04.04]You might find this thing at a birthday party.
[179:07.10]Ow.
[179:09.06]I need, like, red.
[179:12.59]I need, like, purple.
[179:14.93]We actually had one of these on stream.
[179:17.19]Actually, two of them, so.
[179:20.37]Oh, it's red.
[179:23.17]I can't even get in.
[179:27.33]Okay, that looks fucking terrible.
[179:29.19]It looks like somebody just put three pegs into a pumpkin.
[179:31.97]We're getting there, great.
[179:40.77]I can't even, I've done this first.
[179:50.95]You gotta get it in like, there we go.
[179:52.47]You don't, don't even, why am I even hitting it like this?
[179:54.31]Just press it in.
[179:57.57]I'm using it like it's an actual mallet.
[179:59.19]This thing weighs like four, like maybe four ounces.
[180:02.41]My pants aren't falling down, right?
[180:05.25]Okay, that's just the diaper.
[180:06.13]I thought that was my underwear.
[180:08.29]I actually thought that was my actual underwear.
[180:15.35]Okay, this is Jeremy Gets Hurt on stream.
[180:39.19]Don't try this at home.
[180:42.67]It ain't going in there.
[180:43.27]It's going to have to go somewhere else.
[180:48.64]It's not even close.
[180:51.04]We should have just had somebody make one.
[180:53.48]We should have had somebody make one of these.
[180:55.56]Hey, can somebody carve a cool pumpkin?
[181:01.93]I'm not.
[181:02.77]I'm not going to do that.
[181:10.23]Let's do it with my hands, it's way easier.
[181:11.63]Fuck off.
[181:18.51]Can these be eyes?
[181:19.69]No.
[181:23.21]There's no red.
[181:26.74]Guys, I'm having trouble, what's that thing?
[181:28.80]You have no idea how to do this?
[181:31.38]No, I do.
[181:32.34]It's with knife.
[181:33.91]It's with knifes.
[181:36.23]And I am slippery.
[181:39.65]That's like my superpower right now.
[181:41.73]You want the slippery guy to hold the knife?
[181:45.28]What?
[181:52.34]That actually felt pretty good.
[181:59.04]He held up more than Three Fingers.
[182:04.26]Hold up more than Three Fingers.
[182:08.30]How have I not done that before?
[182:11.76]He's not reacting.
[182:12.78]Don't.
[182:13.08]He's bad react.
[182:14.16]React harder.
[182:15.64]React harder.
[182:17.44]Halloween.
[182:18.02]No.
[182:18.14]And chat loses another 800 for saying clown.
[182:23.90]Oh, for saying clown.
[182:24.70]You guys lose points.
[182:25.42]That's the end of the round.
[182:26.04]You said clown.
[182:28.87]He didn't react.
[182:29.79]No, because at some point, it just becomes numb.
[182:33.49]You know what I mean?
[182:34.04]At some point, it's happened so many times, it's like, OK, I guess it's happening again.
[182:38.82]You guys said clown.
[182:42.90]What the fuck am I even doing?
[182:44.38]OK, this is like a map to where you've been.
[182:49.03]You have this shit in your living room to make your friends jealous.
[182:52.89]I've been to Canada, I've been to Toronto, and then I've been over here, up here into the Great Lakes.
[182:57.82]Down here, oh yeah, I love Oklahoma.
[183:03.62]Are you doing it again?
[183:04.24]I was like, what the fuck?
[183:12.77]How do I get in this?
[183:14.37]Can this be taken off?
[183:15.15]This is like bad, right?
[183:16.08]Can I like pull this off?
[183:20.40]Audio and video are now out of sync, apparently.
[183:23.48]Why is that?
[183:27.92]He doesn't know.
[183:28.90]He didn't react.
[183:29.70]What?
[183:31.24]How does he not know?
[183:31.98]What are you talking about?
[183:35.93]What?
[183:40.71]What did I not do?
[183:43.17]We have to get their points down, by the way.
[183:45.05]OK, lightning round.
[183:47.28]Put up 15 actions for me and like 10 actions for chat.
[183:54.44]Don't tell them.
[183:55.82]Hollow out the pumpkin.
[183:56.78]We didn't do that beforehand.
[183:58.62]We ran out of time.
[184:01.33]I seriously might as well just go like this.
[184:14.04]That's not an action you can fuck off.
[184:18.68]Oh, look at me.
[184:20.59]Get it all out of the way before anybody has any actions.
[184:23.23]There's no battery in here.
[184:27.77]Can I just draw on it?
[184:31.27]Sure.
[184:31.97]Feed it into my ear.
[184:32.59]What's our actions?
[184:36.73]Hold on.
[184:39.23]I just have to go to my diaper.
[184:40.61]Hold on.
[184:40.93]What is it?
[184:42.30]Say it softly.
[184:49.87]I will win this if you give it to me.
[184:51.61]Give me the reactions.
[185:04.38]OK.
[185:08.12]You guys are fucked.
[185:14.60]Although, how many do I have?
[185:17.18]You'll have eight.
[185:18.52]I'll have eight.
[185:20.95]Okay.
[185:24.19]That's solidified enough where I can... No, I'm not going to do that.
[185:28.47]Okay.
[185:29.63]People might go, oh, come on.
[185:31.41]You're not going to carve the pumpkin.
[185:32.94]I'm not going to be the guy on Twitch that has the knife in his hand and is like... Not going to happen.
[185:40.48]I'm not doing that.
[185:46.15]Does that violate TOS?
[185:47.99]Oh, yeah.
[185:48.93]Yeah.
[185:50.99]violates my life.
[185:54.81]It went right down my ass crack right now.
[185:57.13]Just went in.
[185:58.16]It went all the way.
[185:58.78]It just right now for the first time.
[186:01.84]The diaper has been breached.
[186:06.64]So I'm going to draw on this.
[186:07.44]We'll spin it around.
[186:10.86]I'm serious.
[186:11.42]Just spray me with the hose back.
[186:14.74]This is not a joke.
[186:15.84]This is actual spray me all of my whole body with the hose.
[186:23.84]This marker is dead.
[186:25.26]We're just going to look at the pumpkin.
[186:26.36]Might as well just play funny videos.
[186:28.04]Might as well.
[186:29.18]Oh!
[186:29.70]New actions are up.
[186:33.48]I have new actions?
[186:35.54]Yeah, chat.
[186:35.86]OK, chat sees them.
[186:46.54]Can the pumpkin have?
[186:47.28]We did the computer.
[186:48.24]Can we have the pumpkin actions?
[186:52.13]What do I have to do here?
[186:54.50]Get off that.
[186:58.99]We're almost at the end of the show, if you guys are curious.
[187:02.65]Should I try running again?
[187:04.53]This is a treadmill, ready?
[187:05.43]Remember that?
[187:06.35]How's my nerd neck?
[187:10.57]Alright, move the knives.
[187:12.86]Ready?
[187:15.32]Don't run this way.
[187:17.52]Run this way.
[187:20.90]But then what if I like,
[187:28.71]Alright, this looks fucking bad.
[187:30.44]I look like I'm like soaking wet.
[187:34.00]Darling, please help me.
[187:40.55]Alright, not bad.
[187:41.45]I can get it one more time.
[187:45.93]That was a false stride.
[187:46.67]That was a false stride.
[187:47.61]I think I got some on the camera.
[187:57.43]This is what we like to call, this boy is out of material.
[188:02.11]And he can't get into the pumpkin.
[188:05.31]So he's been, he's at the point where he's got nothing left to do.
[188:16.00]Dropping him, no, I'm not gonna drop him.
[188:17.22]This thing weighs like 200 pounds.
[188:20.72]What if I just like shot put it over at production?
[188:24.74]Drop it, I'm not gonna smash this.
[188:26.20]You know, that's bullshit.
[188:29.09]Just do Gallagher.
[188:30.21]This is Gallagher.
[188:30.97]You're watching Gallagher right now.
[188:33.29]Let me tell you something.
[188:40.45]What?
[188:44.47]What?
[188:52.41]Funny voice.
[188:56.33]Hey.
[188:57.96]So what we do here now that our funny voice is done, we just do funny voices for the rest of the stream.
[189:10.33]This is not a good diaper.
[189:11.99]It's actually pretty good.
[189:13.43]And by the way, it's over the top half of my clothes.
[189:19.99]Put the diaper on the pumpkin.
[189:23.73]Give me a diaper.
[189:25.87]There's like 20 in that case.
[189:32.40]Do a back flip.
[189:35.12]I didn't need three.
[189:37.06]Should I just wear them?
[189:37.85]Should I just put these on?
[189:39.83]Okay, let's test it.
[189:40.65]Dump it.
[189:41.39]Oh, he did a thing.
[189:42.15]He did something fucking weird.
[189:43.85]Into the diaper, let's test the diaper.
[189:46.49]Dump it.
[189:50.83]Let's see how good these are.
[189:57.39]You guys talked a lot of shit.
[190:07.20]Nothing got through at the bottom.
[190:08.36]Look at that.
[190:09.32]Pretty good, actually.
[190:10.04]Is this what I'm doing right now?
[190:15.53]We're testing diapers?
[190:17.85]That means I'm out of content.
[190:22.31]That image is now forever on camera.
[190:27.16]Is dumping slime into a diaper to test it.
[190:32.84]Shit.
[190:36.45]Put it on the pumpkin.
[190:37.53]Okay, I'll take that.
[190:41.99]That's a bad idea.
[190:43.91]Why is that bad?
[190:44.67]Typhus, you're gonna protect me!
[190:54.29]This thing can hold like five gallons.
[190:58.67]That's bad advice?
[191:00.25]It's kind of good advice.
[191:04.39]Ugh.
[191:09.01]That's disgusting.
[191:13.74]Can we get the vac back here, please?
[191:18.08]That was nothing in there?
[191:21.70]I don't like that sound.
[191:28.87]Can I see that for a sec?
[191:29.83]Let me see it for just a sec.
[191:31.81]Let's just stick it up here, if we could.
[191:36.35]There we go.
[191:36.95]Thank you.
[191:38.21]Thanks a lot.
[191:48.41]It's like up my nose.
[191:54.82]There's no point for this to even be here anymore.
[192:00.94]There's no reason for this pumpkin.
[192:04.22]We can wash this pumpkin off.
[192:15.28]Alright, I'm gonna try to get into the pumpkin.
[192:17.92]Very gently.
[192:19.18]I just wanna get in.
[192:26.06]Carve it.
[192:28.08]What is all over this?
[192:29.62]I thought that was blood.
[192:30.74]I was like, what the fuck is that?
[192:35.99]Behind you?
[192:36.75]Yeah, I know.
[192:39.27]I can hear them.
[192:42.69]No, not the top rope.
[192:46.28]I'm gonna get, like, frog splashed.
[192:54.51]Okay.
[192:55.99]I just gotta get in.
[192:58.61]If I can get in, then we can see what's in there.
[193:01.27]It's like a science experiment.
[193:05.31]I'm being extraordinarily careful.
[193:06.93]Most careful I've ever been in my whole life is right now.
[193:08.93]Alright, I'm almost in.
[193:17.85]OK, I'm in.
[193:20.84]OK, I'm in.
[193:21.50]This is bait.
[193:27.92]It's not bait.
[193:32.63]You know when you do some things and you go, you know what?
[193:34.41]I probably should just go to church tomorrow.
[193:39.19]That's kind of what's in my mind at the moment.
[193:46.80]Like, I didn't do anything wrong, but I really just feel like I should go to church.
[193:54.53]I can't get in here.
[193:55.59]This pumpkin is thick.
[194:00.23]What we got for a time?
[194:00.95]Uh, another five.
[194:03.54]Got another five minutes?
[194:04.30]We can end this round if you want to putt his chat.
[194:07.66]You want to putt his chat?
[194:10.12]Sure.
[194:10.32]OK.
[194:11.58]Turn it up.
[194:13.58]What was the words for chat?
[194:17.63]Oowoo.
[194:24.53]Comcast.
[194:30.17]Wait, the word was streamer.
[194:34.71]Omega lull.
[194:37.80]Wow.
[194:41.48]And pee.
[194:43.65]How many points did they lose?
[194:46.21]1,700, which puts them way ahead of me still.
[194:52.78]Ooh, pee, streamer pee.
[194:59.25]Aye yi yi.
[194:59.69]When we thought about this like two or three weeks ago, it was a great idea.
[195:12.81]I don't know if you guys heard that, but the people at production said nobody said that.
[195:22.42]Oh, I actually like this costume.
[195:26.70]Be this for Halloween next year.
[195:29.28]Except don't put the diaper on.
[195:30.42]People will think something's wrong.
[195:32.12]If you have a diaper on over your clothes.
[195:34.10]Actually, Doug does that.
[195:38.29]Alright, we should probably close it out here.
[195:40.73]Maybe one more round and that's it.
[195:43.24]Put the rest of the actions on the screen.
[195:44.56]The rest of the actions?
[195:46.16]Yeah, put every action, the rest of every single action that's available on the screen for me right now.
[195:53.70]Okay.
[195:55.94]I am going to literally just stare into the camera.
[196:00.74]What am I gonna do with the pumpkin?
[196:04.28]I don't know, wipe it down and clean it and give it to my mother.
[196:14.71]I'm not going to throw the pumpkin.
[196:16.62]Like, what is going on here?
[196:17.50]Oh, it's like dirt.
[196:21.60]Ugh.
[196:22.78]It's actually really dirty.
[196:29.74]Wait.
[196:34.86]You guys have time?
[196:36.20]Okay.
[196:36.34]How are you guys doing tonight?
[196:38.64]You guys having a good Halloween?
[196:40.51]Did you have a good Halloween?
[196:41.45]New actions on stream.
[196:43.80]There's new actions on screen.
[196:49.42]OK.
[196:50.34]How many?
[196:50.80]A lot.
[196:52.34]A lot.
[196:55.72]More.
[196:56.24]There are more than two dozen.
[196:57.52]OK.
[197:07.11]A pose.
[197:07.75]A pose?
[197:08.05]That's not a pose.
[197:19.04]Let's try to get the whole hat orange.
[197:20.30]I feel like I'm in first grade.
[197:33.12]I'm just like, oh, this is fun.
[197:40.28]Oh, Bob, that looks really good, what you're doing there.
[197:42.36]Oh, Johnny, that's really nice.
[197:45.33]Yes.
[197:49.95]It is.
[197:51.21]Oh, wow.
[197:53.19]What is it?
[197:53.59]What'd you make up?
[197:54.09]What is it?
[197:54.37]What is that a pic?
[197:54.89]What is that?
[197:55.23]What is that of?
[197:55.79]Face.
[198:00.08]Oh, it's a face.
[198:02.86]It looks fan.
[198:03.38]It looks so good.
[198:04.76]Wow.
[198:05.42]I can't wait to tell your mother about it.
[198:07.88]Thank you.
[198:09.02]Like, what the fuck am I doing?
[198:10.24]I'm just standing here rubbing a pumpkin.
[198:14.40]I've been rubbing a pumpkin.
[198:15.94]This is the stream content you've received in the last, like, 30, 40 minutes.
[198:19.48]Is rubbing a pumpkin with oil.
[198:21.96]Chat's fault.
[198:26.02]What do you mean it's chat's fault?
[198:27.10]They came up with the words.
[198:29.99]That's true.
[198:30.49]You guys did come up with these actions.
[198:32.35]You did pretty good.
[198:36.27]Alright, so.
[198:38.83]I've only done one in, like, two dozen actions.
[198:42.45]Really?
[198:43.49]Okay.
[198:43.67]Okay.
[198:56.82]Wait, that actually might be an action.
[198:58.42]I'm going to do something.
[198:59.50]OK, I have to continuously move, but not do anything.
[199:08.01]This thing is heavy enough where I can hold it.
[199:10.23]I look like fucking Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.
[199:15.99]Jim Carrey with the suit on, but he's like.
[199:26.29]I'm not losing points for this, am I?
[199:30.09]I should be.
[199:30.67]What about Chad?
[199:31.39]Does Chad have a thousand things to do?
[199:35.46]It's a shitty Freddy Krueger.
[199:36.84]It's Splatoon Freddy Krueger.
[199:41.22]Oh, oh, oh, I would be, right now, right now, I would be gagging.
[199:45.92]Right now, I would be going, but I'm not going to freak out.
[199:49.66]I'm going to use a diaper.
[199:57.99]Okay.
[200:00.21]Because that was horrible.
[200:01.35]You know when something hits you on the lip and it's something that you really don't want to have in your mouth?
[200:06.38]That just happened.
[200:07.14]And I almost had that immediate reaction.
[200:10.26]It was immediate.
[200:11.10]But I slowed down and I wiped it off with a diaper.
[200:15.34]So thanks for watching, everybody.
[200:16.96]Really appreciate everybody coming out and hanging out here.
[200:20.99]That was a lot of fun.
[200:23.23]Hey, how about that?
[200:24.47]Dr. Schmoikson comes and says hello.
[200:26.53]Hello.
[200:28.53]That was a treat.
[200:29.61]Glad to have Dr. Spikes in back.
[200:35.15]Did pretty good.
[200:36.30]Trivia was fun.
[200:38.10]We got Bugleberry.
[200:39.14]That was fun.
[200:39.64]But seriously, this is getting to a point where it's too gross.
[200:49.98]Do I have something I can spit into?
[200:53.17]Do I have something I can spit into?
[200:55.29]I know that sounds disgusting, but it's been, like, in the back of my throat for, like, at least 20 minutes, and I need to spit.
[201:01.60]Do we have anything to spit?
[201:03.62]We do.
[201:04.12]Okay.
[201:07.20]Where is it?
[201:08.86]I need, like, a cup or a glass or something.
[201:12.38]Not on the... No, no, no, no.
[201:13.89]Not on the floor.
[201:14.75]Is there something over here I can spit in?
[201:23.24]Does it matter?
[201:30.58]Oh, oh, holy, whoa!
[201:33.69]Oh, that's, oh!
[201:37.45]What the fuck was in here?
[201:38.63]It smelled like rotten eggs.
[201:41.47]Oh, oh!
[201:43.57]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[201:45.67]Hey, hey!
[201:47.79]What the fuck is going on?
[201:50.44]Hey!
[201:53.17]No, no, no!
